[0:10:12] <%jubejube56> @DarkNerdShawny either underwear or too short of shorts

[0:10:34] <@akuda_bar> he's got short shorts
[0:10:38] <%jubejube56> Golden rule, shorts to the knees
[0:10:45] <Mr_216> shorts to the balls
[0:10:58] <%akira_chong> Shorts to the knees unless you don't skip leg day
[0:10:58] <%jubejube56> That is a Speedo Mr
[0:11:07] <@akuda_bar> you're just jealous of his legs
[0:11:09] <Mr_216> is he wearing a diaper?
[0:11:17] <%Gadlight> that comes to show how much of a CHADs P4 players are
[0:11:18] <Drunkengen> it really looks like it
[0:11:22] <%jubejube56> I mean if you don't skip leg day what is the need for leg clothing?
[0:11:23] <+DarkNerdShawny> Is he thigh senpai?
[0:11:33] <%Wool> Thigh Senpai
[0:11:36] <@akuda_bar> thigh senpai LUL
[0:11:39] <357Sneak> Thigh High Senpai
[0:11:54] <%Gadlight> woolieGASM
[0:12:06] <%akira_chong> Extrapolating, if you're a total gymrat you can just walk around naked all day.
[0:12:20] <@akuda_bar> @akira_chong that's correct
[0:12:29] <+DarkNerdShawny> How can I focus on this fighting game knowledge with all this thigh in my face
[0:12:29] <%jubejube56> I've been to Europe, this is true
[0:12:34] <WhyIDie> then there's ambiguous animations that are deceptively slow and fast at the same time, like dudley's overhead in ssf4
[0:12:34] <@Menitta> whut
[0:12:38] <seylumiue> Woolz gaining energy from the thought of option selects
[0:12:44] <Bloodhit> Can you change category to Talk Shows & Podcasts?
[0:13:01] <+JakeSG> why
[0:13:02] <Mr_216> This dude is really presenting himself tho, but I respect it
[0:13:19] <%jubejube56> I need a TED Talk on fuzzy blocking ASAP
[0:13:22] <Drunkengen> I guess his a very transparent guy
[0:13:26] <%Gadlight> Now that we are in this topic, its really difficult for me to not being flowcharty sometimes
[0:13:44] <%Gadlight> because it works with most of the opponents, until you fight someone actually good
[0:13:54] <%Gadlight> then you get destroyed
[0:14:27] <stairmaster> wheres the vidya at
[0:14:29] <+DarkNerdShawny> A player counting frames to win a match seems so anime
[0:15:11] <+akingofnoobs> Suh doods
[0:15:16] <primaryfire> it's like 20-23 in a fighting game context because of startup animation keyframes being late or similar to other moves
[0:15:22] <WhyIDie> all play generally boils down to branching flowcharts, you go down the main branch for most normal opponents, against stronger opponents you start mixing up by going down uncommon branches, or learn to tack on an unorthodox branch for their situations
[0:15:30] <prime_name> Pre-action? We DnD bois now?
[0:15:46] <gustavozxd> that's Galaxy brain shit

[0:16:25] <%Mawari_> Mawari_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Theloooooooooooo
[0:16:31] <%Gadlight> similar to samsho, it revolves arround really basic stuff
[0:16:39] <%Gadlight> footsies and good punish game
[0:16:47] <SirlinGames> Yeah that guide is almost a Fantasy Strike guide, too, despite being written 9 years ago
[0:17:01] <%Gadlight> fgs are like that
[0:17:17] <%jubejube56> Yeah except I can actually play Fantasy Strike on PC unlike a certain samurai game....
[0:17:21] <%akira_chong> Yeah, honestly, a lot of why I like samsho are the same reasons I'm a fan of Fantasy Strike.
[0:17:21] <$RocketShot_> Wait are you playing p4au cuz I legit have it open rn
[0:17:28] <+lazylazejv5> @sirlingames is fantasy strike out now?
[0:17:30] <+DarkNerdShawny> This is getting complex. I need to play UNI's tutorial again
[0:17:31] <%jubejube56> tho tbf considering the online of the game, I imagine a PC Port would have been rough

[0:20:42] <+DarkNerdShawny> Pick best girl Yukari you pleebs!
[0:20:43] <%akira_chong> You know what's annoying about P4U? It's not available on anything current-gen. I'd totally buy it if it was.
[0:21:00] <%akira_chong> It's just PS3 and 360.
[0:21:01] <+CaptainPyron> She was pretty fun. All the DLC characters were super cool.
[0:21:02] <YaminoRaiden> For some reason, my double quarter backs aren't working. Shit..!
[0:21:06] <+thatMarcWithaC> It's a shame P4A is backwards compatible on Xbox One but not Ultimax
[0:21:10] <Thanatoast250> Yuuuup
[0:21:16] <gustavozxd> only reason I didn't play this game much it's because it's only PS3 360 and I hate that

[0:21:51] <%jubejube56> I could do with him firing off 360 no-scope d-grabs
[0:21:53] <Thanatoast250> That's a weird way to say Aigis
[0:21:58] <YaminoRaiden> No! No Moopoke please! Not here

[0:22:09] <%Gadlight> woolieGASM
[0:22:09] <+G_R_A_G> ah, P4U: the fighting games where light attacks are on top and strong attacks are on the bottom row
[0:22:13] <TheGreatestAutismo> 40 1080s are optimal
[0:22:15] <%Mawari_> JP voice plzzzzzzzzzz

[0:24:02] <%Gadlight> BBTAG is even more frustrating, because its closer to playing Mahvel than DBFZ
[0:24:17] <hamahiroyuki> @gustavozxd great, this' gon be gud
[0:24:19] <%Wool> I'd argue BBTag is the best team fighter right now
[0:24:22] <gustavozxd> so can you completely ignore doing auto combos in this game or do you have to use them?
[0:24:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> though the killer mighty joey is in there and boy, he's touch
[0:24:28] <%Gadlight> @Wool indeed
[0:24:41] <+DarkNerdShawny> @gustavozxd you can ignore
[0:24:56] <Drunkengen> its only on A
[0:24:57] <%TheOneUpWarrior> TheOneUpWarrior subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Oh man, what an underrated gem! This game has so much going on, in terms of music, style, and mechanics. suuuuper deep.Also rock on 6 months legendary overhype!
[0:25:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's motion plus both buttons
[0:25:02] <+Vestillion> Skullgirls is the best team fighter, I'll hear no objections
[0:25:03] <gustavozxd> I'm ok with the game having auto combos, I just don't want to use them lol
[0:25:04] <%akira_chong> Wait, there are games where you HAVE to use auto combos?
[0:25:05] <FluxWaveZ> @gustavozxd The auto-combos are usually used to lead into better bnbs. So you don't need to rely on them, but a completed one does provide a meter increase.
[0:25:29] <%jubejube56> Somebody always has to mention MvC:I when talking about team fighters
[0:25:34] <+DarkNerdShawny> Just dont hit A repeatingly. Mix it up and you wont auto
[0:25:36] <%jubejube56> .......not me though
[0:25:52] <%akira_chong> @Vestillion My favorite part about the tags in Skullgirls is that you can actually decide to just use one fighter if you want.
[0:26:06] <gustavozxd> like if you're gonna put auto combos in your game, do it like kof14 where it's the worst thing you could do LUL
[0:26:07] <gappy22> ban Akihiko
[0:26:12] <+DarkNerdShawny> How can you mention MvCI if McVI does not exist?
[0:26:26] <%Gadlight> @akira_chong most of games that have autocombos dont actually need to be used except some specific scenarios, i play Million Arthur and UNIST, both have autocombos, but you usually do part of the autocombo string midcombo or as combo starter
[0:26:31] <WhyIDie> skullgirls picked up the team mechanic torch that cvs2 handed off to them
[0:26:37] <%jubejube56> Idk if a tree falls and nobody is there to stream it, does the tourney even happen?
[0:26:38] <+Vestillion> @akira_chong For example, I stubbornly choose to play solo-fortune only.
[0:26:48] <%Gadlight> also most autocombos have heavy proration so its not encouraged to be using them
[0:27:06] <%Gadlight> unless you are maybe, Bardock or Vegito en dbfz
[0:27:27] <+DarkNerdShawny> Is the tree our hopes and dreams for Marvel 4?
[0:27:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, so mighty joey is gonna kick everybody's ass in this game
[0:27:31] <%jubejube56> well aren't most autocombos useful in the air for DBFZ?
[0:27:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, jesus christ
[0:27:32] <%akira_chong> @Gadlight OH, THAT. Yeah, I remember some stuff on DBFZ where you had to use parts of the autocombo because the normal versions wouldn't connect in specific circumstances.
[0:27:42] <%jubejube56> since they sorta vacuum you in for extra damage
[0:27:47] <@Menitta> go chie
[0:27:56] <+DarkNerdShawny> *Shadow Chie
[0:27:57] <%akira_chong> @jubejube56 Yup. That.
[0:28:06] <FluxWaveZ> The first parts of the auto-combos in FighterZ, yeah. But they then go into something else more optimal, not a continued A mash
[0:28:09] <%Gadlight> @akira_chong yeah
[0:28:15] <gustavozxd> we got a persona 5 musou over a fighting game
[0:28:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> tartarus magician 1 is the lobby with the only 3 people in it if anyone wants to join
[0:28:23] <fuji_92> I wonder which character is Woolz playing OhMyDog
[0:28:27] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:28:31] <WhyIDie> yeah, there's a lot of air combos in dbfz where the optimum path is to use the auto combo because it has greater tracking to the opponent
[0:28:34] <+DarkNerdShawny> *we got a persona 5 musou AND a fighting game coming
[0:28:37] <Drunkengen> ag. i want a P5A
[0:28:40] <%Gadlight> pls someone pick minazuki
[0:28:43] <%Gadlight> woolieGASM
[0:28:49] <FluxWaveZ> Woolie is Akihiko for sure
[0:28:53] <%Buttface_> Buttface_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! oh boy it's that time again
[0:29:02] <%akira_chong> Hey, I forget: Is there air blocking in Grabble?
[0:29:02] <fuji_92> when's Teddie mirrors? Kappa
[0:29:07] <%jubejube56> I love how Chie's little meter looks like a stickman from one of those old animations
[0:29:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> what are combos says myself
[0:29:15] <Drunkengen> i wonder if im gonna see any insta kills by shadow naoto
[0:29:16] <%Wool> yes there's air blocking in Grabble @akira_chong
[0:29:18] <+DarkNerdShawny> P5 fighting game comes out im going STRAIGHT to those P4 and P3 characters!
[0:29:21] <gustavozxd> at this point I don't even believe the fighting game is ever gonna exist even though I'm pretty sure they confirmed it LUL it's just been sooo loong
[0:29:22] <FluxWaveZ> @akira_chong There is, but 2H is air unblockable
[0:29:33] <FluxWaveZ> Or was it EX DP... something like that
[0:29:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone pick DOG
[0:29:39] <@Menitta> dont call it Grabble...
[0:29:43] <%akira_chong> So is it 2H or 2C?
[0:29:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> PICK KEN
[0:29:46] <+DarkNerdShawny> Protein!! PogChamp
[0:29:47] <%Wool> Grabble's got nooch
[0:29:51] <fuji_92> protein boys PogChamp
[0:29:58] <gustavozxd> not enough meat
[0:29:58] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:29:59] <%akira_chong> Grabble does indeed have nooch.
[0:30:09] <%Wool> oh boy, it's Yukiko, the bottom tier of BBTag
[0:30:16] <%Buttface_> and of this game
[0:30:26] <%Buttface_> the secret tech is to super jump airdash
[0:30:33] <%Buttface_> and take a hit and forward tech in the air
[0:30:35] <+GrassCannon> she's not bottom tier anymore! Now she's just super low
[0:30:46] <%jubejube56> She is still worst girl in my heart though
[0:30:47] <gustavozxd> Yukiko, the training dummy for the bbtag demo
[0:31:03] <fuji_92> yukiko healing is disgusting tbh
[0:31:10] <MsVcol> eww yukiko
[0:31:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> Woolie met his match!! PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:31:12] <gustavozxd> I can't say much about the p4 girls cause I barely remember that game at all anymore
[0:31:13] <%Buttface_> it's disgustingly bad
[0:31:15] <MsVcol> eww yuiko mirrors
[0:31:18] <%wujak> wow. i dont remember what any of teddie's items do
[0:31:21] <%akira_chong> I like this "worst girl is bottom tier" timeline.
[0:31:26] <%Buttface_> since it's her DP which means it costs health to do it
[0:31:37] <fuji_92> yukiko mirrors, only healing PogChamp
[0:31:38] <%Snarky_McGrump> Haven’t seen this game played in years
[0:31:47] <MsVcol> hot take: the persona 4 girls are all trash except rise
[0:32:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> @msvcol hi pat's alt
[0:32:02] <+G_R_A_G> apparently Thelo still knows how to play Persona
[0:32:09] <BigBossBobRoss> that's a mild take at best
[0:32:12] <%jubejube56> @MsVcol I think Naoto can't be trash purely because of how she plays in this game
[0:32:12] <gustavozxd> @akira_chong you basically get two different disgust look if you main her LUL
[0:32:15] <fuji_92> hotter take: there are no trash girls
[0:32:19] <%Snarky_McGrump> How sweet would a p5 arena be
[0:32:23] <%Buttface_> moopokNervoushab moopokNervoushab moopokNervoushab moopokNervoushab
[0:32:26] <%Buttface_> moopokThink moopokThink moopokThink moopokThink
[0:32:33] <TheGreatestAutismo> You may think Rise is your pal, but remember bud, she's everyone's pal
[0:32:35] <%Buttface_> jiyuEye jiyuEye jiyuEye jiyuEye
[0:32:36] <+DarkNerdShawny> FYI. Theres a good working PS3 emulator if anyone wants to play this game on PC.....I dont condone piracy......or do i hmmmmmm?
[0:32:36] <hamahiroyuki> I have an aunt named Yukiko so she was always a turn off for me LUL
[0:32:38] <+G_R_A_G> "Persona 4 Arena 2: Persona 5 Arena"
[0:32:40] <TheGreatestAutismo> *gal
[0:32:48] <@Menitta> this game envokes loud arcade stick sounds
[0:32:51] <BigBossBobRoss> true take: everyone in persona is trash
[0:32:57] <Thanatoast250> :o
[0:33:01] <Drunkengen> Insta Kill?
[0:33:02] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta tapatapatapa
[0:33:02] <+DarkNerdShawny> @G_R_A_G wouldnt it be Arena 3?
[0:33:04] <gustavozxd> persona 2 characters are the best and it's sad
[0:33:10] <Thanatoast250> Dayum
[0:33:12] <@Menitta> tippitytap
[0:33:14] <fuji_92> @bigbossbobross speaking the truth there
[0:33:15] <+DarkNerdShawny> @gustavozxd this!!
[0:33:16] <Haarute> that was a great round.
[0:33:16] <%akira_chong> @BigBossBobRoss bringin' the truth
[0:33:20] <kerotuyu> God I love her song in this game
[0:33:21] <+itsjustdoogan> Good evening
[0:33:23] <%Buttface_> hot take: all the protagonists got the pizza but tatsuya only got the crust
[0:33:23] <%Gadlight> please, minazuki woolieGASM
[0:33:23] <gustavozxd> Ann is just discount Lisa
[0:33:29] <%mightyjoey2> Teddie is the best character in Persona 4
[0:33:35] <%Buttface_> joey
[0:33:39] <%Buttface_> I'm gonna ban you
[0:33:41] <%mightyjoey2> Hey
[0:33:43] <%Buttface_> from everything
[0:33:45] <MsVcol> teddie is bad and you should feel bad
[0:33:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> when you start drinking a couple of alcoholic drinks and your parents think your becoming an alcoholic.
[0:33:54] <%mightyjoey2> I didn’t make the rules
[0:33:55] <WhyIDie> take that back, nanako is an angel and cannot do wrong
[0:34:03] <%Buttface_> joey isn't it past your bedtime
[0:34:09] <gustavozxd> nanako and Aigis are the same person so
[0:34:13] <Applecannon63> Nanako for P5A
[0:34:17] <Carlemone> something special about watching a fighting game that's dead online
[0:34:17] <+DarkNerdShawny> I will pick Teddie.....up and throw him into the fire
[0:34:18] <EnlightenedKramer> ma boy woolie!
[0:34:20] <%jubejube56> I mean nanako did kill alot of people...
[0:34:21] <fuji_92> hot take: ann looks better without the pigtails
[0:34:29] <BigBossBobRoss> nanako shouldn't have come back to add some actual emotion to the scooby doo gang
[0:34:30] <Drunkengen> Teen Nanako when?
[0:34:34] <adamisfruit> I like Teddy’s design. He’s cool.
[0:34:37] <+Story_Ark> Does anyone else wish they ported this to the PS4?
[0:34:47] <+DarkNerdShawny> PC port when?
[0:34:48] <gustavozxd> @story_ark 1000000%
[0:34:49] <WhyIDie> who cares if she slaughtered some people, she still cannot do wrong
[0:34:51] <fuji_92> Nanako vs Ken
[0:34:53] <+DarkNerdShawny> PS3 emulator now!
[0:34:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> COME JOIN TARTARUS MAGICIAN 1 lobby, there's people there
[0:34:56] <+Story_Ark> teddie is beary cool :)
[0:35:04] <gustavozxd> PS4 PC I don't care I just want to play this fucking gaame
[0:35:06] <Applecannon63> Nanako Vs Akechi
[0:35:20] <+Story_Ark> its one of the only reasons i have a ps3 lol
[0:35:26] <%jubejube56> clearly nanako low profiles all of Akechi's attacks easy matchup
[0:35:26] <Drunkengen> I mean if Akechi can get higher than P5 protag
[0:35:29] <Destructus0> man I miss playing this game
[0:35:30] <+G_R_A_G> I'm genuinely curious how long it's been since each of these guys last played P4U at all
[0:35:32] <gustavozxd> atlus HATED the idea of playable nanako or detective dad (forgot his name)
[0:35:35] <+DarkNerdShawny> @gustavozxd *cough* PS3emulator *cough* LUL Kappa
[0:35:55] <%mightyjoey2> no buttface
[0:35:56] <%TheGershon> What was up with red hair dude in this game being called P5Hero in the files
[0:35:58] <%mightyjoey2> it’s like
[0:36:00] <%mightyjoey2> 7
[0:36:02] <gustavozxd> @darknerdshawny y'know what I might look into that cause I've been thirsty for this game since it came out
[0:36:04] <%Buttface_> year
[0:36:07] <%Buttface_> yeah*
[0:36:07] <Drunkengen> but where to get the game for ps3 emulator
[0:36:11] <%Buttface_> that's what I said
[0:36:16] <Applecannon63> Sho?
[0:36:20] <xiccy> Dojima@gustavozxd
[0:36:24] <%TheGershon> Yeah
[0:36:25] <%mightyjoey2> my bedtime isn’t until 8
[0:36:27] <%mightyjoey2> GOD
[0:36:29] <+Story_Ark> i once went to a tournament at a con dressed as Ken, while playing as him. i sucked so i lost but i cant cosplay chie so that was my 2nd best thing to do
[0:36:31] <+DarkNerdShawny> I could tell yall where to get games, if i dont get banned for it lol
[0:36:33] <gustavozxd> just add a bunch of weirdo playable character man
[0:36:42] <fuji_92> y'all cowards cause I don't see any iks SoonerLater
[0:36:53] <Hacerous> this game looks sick, shame i didnt get into it
[0:36:55] <%Gadlight> i want to someone land Minazuki instakill
[0:36:56] <gustavozxd> Dojima yeah thanks, have him with nanako as his persona or vice versa LUL
[0:37:01] <Applecannon63> Make Mona Playable but he is a fucking regular cat
[0:37:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:37:03] <ArbyW> What's good
[0:37:12] <hamahiroyuki> Is caroline and justine should have a single hitbox or do the ice climbers?
[0:37:16] <+thatMarcWithaC> What's good Arby
[0:37:17] <+DarkNerdShawny> The only downside to the Emu is no online
[0:37:27] <ArbyW> yoooooo @thatmarcwithac
[0:37:27] <fuji_92> playable mona is just teddie
[0:37:28] <%jubejube56> @hamahiroyuki probably be like the maids from Melty Blood
[0:37:34] <gustavozxd> @hamahiroyuki BlazBlue Carl
[0:37:34] <+Story_Ark> Mona playable and the next "MY ARMOR!" is "ITS ALMOST SCARY HOW GOOD I AM!"
[0:37:35] <KazMkII> Any of them play Elizabeth?
[0:37:39] <+thatMarcWithaC> @ArbyDMC spookyTrollno
[0:37:50] <ArbyW> Didn't expect to find you here
[0:38:00] <+thatMarcWithaC> It's Ultimax, I have to
[0:38:05] <+DarkNerdShawny> Someone play as Shadow Labyy you cowards!!! kik
[0:38:14] <Applecannon63> mona would just be a regular cat then transform into his phantom thieve form as special moves/supers
[0:38:14] <ArbyW> Man that Akihiko colour is my everything
[0:38:28] <Applecannon63> make mona just be Zeku
[0:38:40] <Drunkengen> whtat if joker just plays like Smash?
[0:38:41] <+DarkNerdShawny> is this a 1-1 Match right now?
[0:38:47] <%TheGershon> Shout outs to Yukiko's VA for being the best
[0:38:53] <fuji_92> ^
[0:38:55] <%akira_chong> Truer take: If you play Atlus' games all the way through as a Westerner you have this depressing realization that even the "counter-cultural" things in Japan (like P5) are ridiculously conformist.
[0:39:05] <gustavozxd> play as futaba, and she's basically captain commando but phantom thieves
[0:39:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> Come on Woolie!
[0:39:18] <ArbyW> My only Persona experience is the first 30 minutes of 3 Portable
[0:39:20] <fuji_92> Amanda Winn Lee is indeed the best <3
[0:39:27] <+scizor285> I wanna see Woolie get grappled
[0:39:27] <hamahiroyuki> I dont know that much of fighting games so I feel stupid for making question that I cant process the awnser
[0:39:29] <Drunkengen> weed
[0:39:35] <+DarkNerdShawny> You spelled Erin Fitzgerald wrong?
[0:39:35] <ArbyW> other than that I just like the designs.
[0:39:58] <ArbyW> Never even touched this game.
[0:40:06] <+Story_Ark> Erin Fitzgerald is objectively the best because she actually jointed the Church of Chie community
[0:40:08] <fuji_92> Erin Fitzgerald is just great too <3
[0:40:10] <+thatMarcWithaC> It's one of my first anime fighters
[0:40:13] <+Story_Ark> *joined
[0:40:15] <Applecannon63> Joker would just play like smash self but his persona attacks on its own
[0:40:35] <fuji_92> Amanda Winn Lee is in the facebook group Persona Hell tho
[0:40:37] <%jubejube56> I'd love to see Joker's version of a THunder God Dance
[0:40:40] <ArbyW> Isn't this game on Xbone BC?
[0:40:42] <+DarkNerdShawny> Actual EF love in the chat?! Im smahappy!
[0:40:46] <gustavozxd> I've only played p4 on PS2 so the "new" chie is still weird to me
[0:40:49] <@Menitta> I need to watch those videos of Amanda Winn Lee talking about smoking weed
[0:40:58] <+Story_Ark> oh she is? oh fair enough then lol
[0:41:06] <%akira_chong> Amanda Winn Lee. OG English Rei.
[0:41:08] <+thatMarcWithaC> @ArbyDMC Only Arena, not Ultimax
[0:41:09] <+Story_Ark> voice actors interacting with their community is great
[0:41:13] <MsVcol> geez woolie quit getting owned already
[0:41:14] <%Gadlight> woolieMIRIN
[0:41:25] <ArbyW> That's ridonculous.
[0:41:27] <Drunkengen> do combo
[0:41:31] <+thatMarcWithaC> Aye it is
[0:41:31] <%TheGershon> She also wrote the original dub/sub scripts for EVA
[0:41:33] <Applecannon63> If Minato was the playable character in smash instead of Joker what would be his special movelist?
[0:41:38] <BigBossBobRoss> do a crimbo
[0:41:39] <%akira_chong> She did?
[0:41:43] <%akira_chong> Oh she's good.
[0:41:44] <%Gadlight> tried to go for the hype and paid for it
[0:41:45] <fuji_92> Yukiko laughter Kreygasm LUL
[0:41:48] <%Gadlight> woolieMIRIN
[0:41:50] <ArbyW> That's like putting SF4 on Xbone and having to buy the future updates. Kappa
[0:41:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's ken
[0:41:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> and dog
[0:41:55] <+Story_Ark> for Joker, they need to do like what MK11 did where Joker references Smash
[0:41:56] <+DarkNerdShawny> @gustavozxd Erin was weird for me at first then the more I played Golden...and P4A, and P4U, and PQ. and P4D. and watch the P4 anime....Shes actually a better actress than the original
[0:42:03] <gustavozxd> @applecannon63 it would be pretty generic probably, yuu too
[0:42:03] <%TheGershon> She's the one who wrote "I'm so fucked up"
[0:42:20] <+Story_Ark> the original voice for chie legit sounds bored out of her mind @darknerdshawny
[0:42:21] <%jubejube56> @Applecannon63 Pretty sure he would act like one of those walking walls from Mario 64
[0:42:24] <Applecannon63> but Minato has like more weapons than Yuu
[0:42:28] <%akira_chong> @TheGershon SHE'S A GENIUS
[0:42:41] <%wujak> wujak gifted a Tier 1 sub to mightyjoey2! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel!
[0:42:42] <gustavozxd> oh yeah PS2 minato can have all the weapons I forgot about that
[0:42:43] <fuji_92> @darknerdshawny agreed
[0:42:43] <Applecannon63> plus the persona magic fusion mechanic
[0:42:48] <+DarkNerdShawny> @Story_Ark I used to like her until Erin, now I cant help but hear all of her flaws
[0:43:05] <Applecannon63> Minato has spell fusions
[0:43:19] <fuji_92> old chie va just sounded like a old lady tbh
[0:43:21] <+Story_Ark> yeah, it helps that erin really adores the character as much as a lot of fans
[0:43:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think they made the sword his 'canon' weapon though. I dont think he used any other weapons in the movies, did he?
[0:43:25] <%akira_chong> Seriously tho why is Chie so thicc
[0:43:27] <gustavozxd> femc costume would be cool too
[0:43:30] <%wolfofsound> I only know these characters because of doujins LUL
[0:43:46] <+Story_Ark> chie doujins :)
[0:43:48] <Drunkengen> I wish we got Eikichi in so we can have GUTAIR CASE MACHINEGUN
[0:43:51] <fuji_92> @akira_chong Kong fu
[0:43:57] <%wolfofsound> @Story_Ark Kappa
[0:43:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> people call anything thicc nowadays huh ResidentSleeper
[0:43:59] <%Gadlight> @wolfofsound i hope are those where the girls look ultra thicc and not the canon look
[0:44:01] <gustavozxd> @drunkengen best weapon
[0:44:08] <+scizor285> futaba doujins are nice. Kappa
[0:44:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:44:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> Reggie needds to do a better job at making an opening using Tomoe before rushing inside. Chie is best at close range but you need to make an opening to use her best
[0:44:14] <%Gadlight> !uptime
[0:44:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 8 minutes
[0:44:19] <%akira_chong> look at those thighs @FuqBoiSlim
[0:44:21] <%wolfofsound> @Gadlight there is a good one where they are all thick
[0:44:37] <%Gadlight> @wolfofsound man of culture i see
[0:44:43] <+Story_Ark> we all know IRL Chie would have Chun Li thighs with all the kicking she does
[0:44:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> @akira_chong yeah she has nice legs I agree 1000% but that doesnt make her THICC
[0:44:59] <OkieToki> ^
[0:45:08] <Drunkengen> None of yall ever heard of

[0:47:51] <gustavozxd> oh yeah I remember Aigis being my favorite cause of Karen Strassman
[0:47:52] <Drunkengen> SUMMON THE GOD HAND
[0:47:59] <%jubejube56> I think we can all agree that on a purely visual design, Yukari is at least second best P3 girl
[0:48:04] <Applecannon63> I can't believe Chie fisted the fuck out of Yukiko
[0:48:12] <fuji_92> @jubejube56 true
[0:48:15] <ArbyW> @thatmarcwithac Should I get a PS3 for this or am I good on 360
[0:48:18] <+DarkNerdShawny> Anyone realize its best friend vs best friend. Chie vs Yukiko?
[0:48:26] <+Story_Ark> everyone knows that best p3 girl is that sports girl (yuko?)
[0:48:29] <%mightyjoey2> PS3 has more players that play now

[0:49:27] <gustavozxd> dynasty warriors 9 is one of the worst anything ever, get ready for p5s
[0:49:29] <%Gadlight> Its the Guts Mechanic
[0:49:34] <%jubejube56> Realising Chie's throw is maybe a reference to the king's game?
[0:49:44] <+DarkNerdShawny> "Dont think.....DANCE" - Chie in dancing all night
[0:49:50] <%Gadlight> when you are in Yellow life you hit like a truck to non yellow life chars
[0:49:52] <+G_R_A_G> it just occurred to me I'm completely unused to hearing English voices in this game
[0:50:03] <ArbyW> Don't think, succ
[0:50:07] <+G_R_A_G> the announcer in the Japanese version is a guy who is really common as a TV announcer in Japan, which was really good casting
[0:50:10] <gustavozxd> oh yeah I actually like Ken
[0:50:11] <fuji_92> Someone has to take Chad-kun so we see ziocars all day

[0:51:48] <gustavozxd> @darknerdshawny would just be funny to randomly say "I like men" outta nowhere though LUL
[0:52:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> alright cool, I bought this game 3 years ago and played it for 20 mins so I cant wait to get blown up live
[0:52:11] <hamahiroyuki> Yo, if they keep the navi in p5 arena I hope Futaba uses fgc terms
[0:52:18] <%mightyjoey2> Aki’s walk animation is really funny
[0:52:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> @gustavozxd sometimes we just gotta like men lil a bit. no homo tho no homo.
[0:52:33] <ArbyW> it's tough being a FG player and owning an Xbone.
[0:52:42] <%mightyjoey2> rip
[0:52:44] <+Story_Ark> elizabeth is a pretty underrated p3 girl ngl
[0:52:44] <Drunkengen> Just a couple of GUYS
[0:52:45] <ArbyW> there's SF4 and KI and that's about it.
[0:52:46] <%jubejube56> @ArbyDMC KI tho
[0:52:51] <+DarkNerdShawny> *its tough owning an XBone
[0:52:55] <ArbyW> See what if I don't enjoy KI
[0:52:57] <+Story_Ark> UBER STEAK POWER
[0:53:03] <gustavozxd> well considering Akihiko is a man, yeah sure yeah yeah @darknerdshawny
[0:53:21] <%jubejube56> Well then I guess git got
[0:53:28] <Daxalog> So im assuming this is what it looks like when they fight monsters during the turnbased combat
[0:53:35] <ArbyW> Sucks cause I didn't have a choice in the matter
[0:53:41] <ArbyW> Oh well.
[0:53:47] <%jubejube56> lol could always not buy a console when it releases
[0:53:54] <%yeknomlive> yes dude
[0:54:00] <ArbyW> "I didn't have a choice in the matter"
[0:54:03] <+DarkNerdShawny> @Daxalog No, they actually stand in a straight line and wait their turn respectfully.
[0:54:15] <%jubejube56> you saying you got it as a gift or something?
[0:54:20] <ArbyW> No
[0:54:24] <%jubejube56> hmm
[0:54:28] <%jubejube56> okay whateva
[0:54:28] <ArbyW> was my brother and dad's decision
[0:54:39] <%jubejube56> oh, well clearly they need better taste
[0:54:40] <fuji_92> IK him Wools
[0:54:49] <Applecannon63> apparently P5 was originally gonna be an action rpg
[0:54:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> i see you menitta
[0:54:52] <+DarkNerdShawny> Buy a PC
[0:54:53] <gustavozxd> D:
[0:54:54] <ArbyW> They've been team Xbox since day one which sucks for little weeb me.
[0:55:00] <@Menitta> I am RUSTY
[0:55:02] <ArbyW> Halo is the best tho
[0:55:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, i'll play you when you get done with that match
[0:55:17] <ArbyW> used to have a good PC but it broke.
[0:55:27] <$RocketShot_> What lobby is it gonna be do we know yet
[0:55:27] <+Story_Ark> sharing a name with Aki's persona makes me very confused at tournies
[0:55:31] <ArbyW> Now I just wanna save up for my own laptop so I can get back into my Vidya.
[0:55:35] <+DarkNerdShawny> Halo...is there a vomit emote?
[0:55:42] <ArbyW> So anyway, Akihiko is the coolest.
[0:55:43] <%akira_chong> So I have Woolie's UNIST stream up on my laptop. What's the definition of an anime fighter versus a non-anime fighter? Is it, as I suspect, the relatively non-existent neutral game?
[0:55:50] <ArbyW> also shush Halo rocks.
[0:56:05] <$RocketShot_> Three was the last good halo game tho
[0:56:17] <ArbyW> It wasn't but whatever you say.
[0:56:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> I dont like Halo, i am a weeb, sir
[0:56:24] <%akira_chong> I thought Reach was.
[0:56:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> halo reach
[0:56:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> I haven't played a video game in 5 years
[0:56:27] <ArbyW> So am I.
[0:56:36] <%jubejube56> Reach is pretty close to anime
[0:56:40] <gustavozxd> I'm willing to give Halo a chance when it comes out on steam
[0:56:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> reach is the last legit good one
[0:56:43] <ArbyW> "I hope they don't find out I've never played a video game."
[0:56:56] <ArbyW> "shit I don't even know what a video game is."
[0:56:56] <+Story_Ark> Cortana is a waifu
[0:57:00] <+DarkNerdShawny> I started Halo talk NotLikeThis
[0:57:07] <+scizor285> I wanna see Woolie blown up on stream. 😂
[0:57:09] <ArbyW> Halo is western anime.
[0:57:15] <Drunkengen> FINISH THE FIGHT
[0:57:16] <%jubejube56> Cortana died then reincarnated onto every Windows 10 pc
[0:57:22] <$RocketShot_> Goddam
[0:57:41] <gustavozxd> Halo and half life are these weird Western games that I never got into and I just look at it from afar
[0:57:50] <%jubejube56> Is western anime not just Avatar the last airbender?
[0:57:55] <fuji_92> SOMEONE IK SOMEONE PLS BibleThump
[0:58:01] <+VideoGameTim_> moopokNervoushab

[0:59:09] <Sofa_King_Hype> Time to get into spriting games!
[0:59:11] <%akira_chong> Also, @jubejube56 , I think you can add She-Ra, Voltron: Legendary Defender, Thundercats 2011 and Castlevania to that list.
[0:59:12] <ArbyW> Depends
[0:59:18] <ArbyW> who's the grappler in this game
[0:59:24] <$RocketShot_> Kanji

[0:59:25] <fuji_92> kanji
[0:59:25] <+VideoGameTim_> kanji

[1:00:55] <+DarkNerdShawny> We are Chie bias
[1:00:55] <@akuda_bar> i don't know why everyone poops on yukiko, her persona is gr8
[1:01:00] <+DarkNerdShawny> WE ARE THE BIAS!
[1:01:01] <gustavozxd> so why do people love chie so much?
[1:01:05] <%jubejube56> Do Chie fans just conveniently forget her cooking?
[1:01:10] <YaminoRaiden> Yukiko is best party girl
[1:01:11] <fuji_92> I love yukiko, but she wouldn't be my 10th choice
[1:01:11] <@Menitta> Chie is just a fun character
[1:01:12] <ArbyW> I think they're all hot.
[1:01:12] <+blademaster247> You've been visited by the Naoto gang
[1:01:14] <el_patronn64> Lol

[1:01:23] <%wolfofsound> My dick doesn't care about cooking
[1:01:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @akuda_bar it's cause yukiko sucks as a character
[1:01:27] <+Story_Ark> This stream is sponsored by the Church of Chie, as one of the mods myself :)

[1:03:27] <gnarly_memes_bro> chie got the feets, right reggie? Kappa Kappa
[1:03:36] <ArbyW> I'll be honest I don't like Yu at all.
[1:03:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chie's feet dont go for much on the Feet Market since shes not a Gamer Girl
[1:03:40] <CalliegulaStrems> Aki would make me work out but Kanji would knit me cool toys
[1:03:41] <gustavozxd> Naoto Kuzunoha
[1:03:43] <fuji_92> CHOOSE NOW CHAT: DOJIMA OR SOJIRO?

[1:03:53] <Thanatoast250> Sojiro
[1:03:53] <Man_in_the_Red> @arbydmc so you dont like yourself Kappa
[1:03:54] <OkieToki> it's gotta be sojiro dude

[1:04:20] <ArbyW> Yukari best girl.
[1:04:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> i jumped into it
[1:04:24] <+Story_Ark> @hamahiroyuki shes a sentai ranger, so thats cool i guess
[1:04:32] <%akira_chong> @WhyIDie A lot of people, present company included, forget the fact that Chie's a massive martial arts movie dork. That's CORE to her appeal. CORE, I SAY.
[1:04:36] <+DarkNerdShawny> I stan Yukari only because Persona 3 Dancing moon night
[1:04:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> i should've known better
[1:04:40] <LTKonnor> More like a hentai ranger Kappa
[1:04:43] <@Menitta> I forgot how fucking fun this game is
[1:04:44] <%jubejube56> Dojima vs Sojiro is literally "your Dad vs the Dad you tell him not to worry about"
[1:04:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Inaba is Eternal
[1:04:59] <gustavozxd> Yukari at least learned to not be a huge piece of shit, took her long enough
[1:05:00] <+Story_Ark> @akira_chong i bet if you gave chie a fighting game shed be the biggest gamer girl
[1:05:02] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus I'm wanna suck you off

[1:05:36] <YaminoRaiden> !MOTIVATED

[1:05:37] <@Moobot> 435 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:05:38] <SenhorGordon> Oh man I miss this game
[1:05:38] <Man_in_the_Red> @darknerdshawny Persona 2 is that even a question LUL
[1:05:39] <ArbyW> Persona 2 Eternal Punishment
[1:05:41] <%akira_chong> Part 3
[1:05:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> INABA IS ETERNAL EleGiggle EleGiggle EleGiggle
[1:05:42] <LTKonnor> Anyone who doesn't say Persona 2 is fake news Kappa
[1:05:43] <fuji_92> P5, then P3=P4
[1:05:48] <%wolfofsound> oof
[1:05:48] <%jubejube56> Persona 1 and 2 don't even exist chat geez
[1:05:50] <gnarly_memes_bro> personally my favorite persona game is Yokai Watch
[1:05:51] <OkieToki> P4
[1:05:51] <Destructus0> smt nocturne

[1:06:01] <+Story_Ark> TA-KA-MA-KEY
[1:06:02] <Thanatoast250> P3FES>P5>P4
[1:06:03] <ArbyW> NOCTURNE FEATURING DANRE
[1:06:06] <%akira_chong> Vento Aureo is the best Persona
[1:06:08] <gustavozxd> each persona has its own highs and lows so it's hard for me to have a fav
[1:06:09] <+DarkNerdShawny> Whats a Persona 2?.....You mean Persona 4 since Persona 3 is Persona 1? @haveswordmuststing Kappa Kappa
[1:06:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> SuhKahMuhToe 4Head

[1:06:18] <+kikaijima> anyone who says p5 is best hasnt played the other persona games lol
[1:06:19] <%Gadlight> at least its not TATSUMAKI SENPUKYAKU levels of bad like SF Cartoon
[1:06:19] <fuji_92> GET OUT WITH P3FES, P3P FOR DAYS
[1:06:20] <YaminoRaiden> 4 Golden
[1:06:21] <+Baekon01> 4
[1:06:22] <%mightyjoey2> P1 sucks
[1:06:24] <%wolfofsound> like choosing a favorite child
[1:06:27] <fuji_92> 4 golden
[1:06:30] <ArbyW> How the fuck is there still no Demi Fiend model swap for V
[1:06:31] <gustavozxd> see I just said that
[1:06:31] <+Story_Ark> P3FES is better with cheats especially on the Answer
[1:06:32] <+Press_X_ToJASON> @kikaijima accurate
[1:06:33] <SenhorGordon> P4 best villain P5 best music / style P3 best story
[1:06:35] <Man_in_the_Red> @darknerdshawny FF3 is the best Final Fantasy Kappa
[1:06:38] <CalliegulaStrems> P3 Best Story P4 Best Characters P5 Best Gameplay
[1:06:43] <gustavozxd> see I just said what woolie said
[1:06:45] <%jubejube56> P3 has a good story told poorly
[1:06:46] <$RocketShot_> I like p3 music best
[1:06:48] <%akira_chong> @WoolieVersus with the politician answer
[1:06:53] <+Story_Ark> Quality of Life
[1:06:55] <Lewisisphat> P1 is rough, good OST though
[1:06:57] <+DarkNerdShawny> @haveswordmuststing you mean FF6's FF3, right? Kappa
[1:06:58] <gustavozxd> 5 has gameplay
[1:07:03] <LTKonnor> Persona 5 has the best UI
[1:07:10] <WhyIDie> secret of mana is best FF Kappa
[1:07:11] <ArbyW> out here with that Mike Ross answer
[1:07:13] <%jubejube56> @LTKonnor Agreed by a landslide
[1:07:14] <AThing_> P1 is rough, P2 is great except for the combat
[1:07:16] <YaminoRaiden> P5 wins for SLs because there isn't a single bad one.
[1:07:20] <ArbyW> "Nobody sucks, everyone is good."
[1:07:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> P5 has the best combat out of all of them
[1:07:28] <%mightyjoey2> P3 story, P4 cast, P5 gameplay
[1:07:33] <Man_in_the_Red> P5 is the best at nothing beyond playing like an actual SMT
[1:07:34] <CalliegulaStrems> Just said that
[1:07:36] <+Story_Ark> Anyone else wish they would make a remake of P3 to fix the combat problem?
[1:07:36] <CalliegulaStrems> High five!
[1:07:38] <%Gadlight> 5 aesthetics and themes are stronger than 4, but 3's depressing end of the world scenario is really cool imo
[1:07:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> Blue Dragon for XBox 36 is the best Persona Game
[1:07:40] <SenhorGordon> Yukiko worst girl
[1:07:41] <One_More_Beer_> I want p5a soooooo bad
[1:07:42] <Drunkengen> All of them?
[1:07:43] <$RocketShot_> I really don’t like the cast of 5 that much
[1:07:45] <+kikaijima> p5 is the best visually and gameplay wise but as soon as the other games inevitably get remade they'll all take a steamy dump on p5
[1:07:48] <fuji_92> nah, p5 cast is more solid than p4
[1:07:48] <+DarkNerdShawny> ok ok ok......Persona 1 & Persona 2 vs P3, P4, P5.
[1:07:57] <fuji_92> I agree with wools answer
[1:07:57] <+Story_Ark> P3 NEEDS a remake tbh
[1:07:57] <Drunkengen> All?
[1:08:01] <ArbyW> 1 and 2
[1:08:02] <+DarkNerdShawny> so old persona vs new persona?
[1:08:03] <gustavozxd> @story_ark I feel that for p2 even harder but yeah, p3 deserves a full remake
[1:08:03] <AThing_> Persona 1 doesn't even compare to p2, much less the later games
[1:08:09] <%jubejube56> @DarkNerdShawny you can't compare NULL values to an actual title
[1:08:09] <%akira_chong> Pick a real favorite, @WoolieVersus you COWARD
[1:08:12] <TheGreatestAutismo> P4 honestly had the most potential, but didn't live up to it.
[1:08:13] <AThing_> P2 stories is a strong arguement to the later ones
[1:08:17] <$RocketShot_> @mightyjoey2 I see you are a teddy of class as well
[1:08:19] <Man_in_the_Red> @darknerdshawny persona 2, dont even think about 1, 3, 4, and 5 Kappa
[1:08:21] <%mightyjoey2> P2=P3>P4>>P5>>>>P1
[1:08:23] <gustavozxd> persona 2 combat is really bad but holy shit the story is great
[1:08:25] <ArbyW> Woolie 2 scurred
[1:08:30] <gnarly_memes_bro> I'll eat a ball of my own pubes the day they remake a persona game after p2
[1:08:35] <ArbyW> Hitler with shades
[1:08:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> You can hold me to those words
[1:08:43] <+Story_Ark> hot take, p3's combat was bad (which is understandable)
[1:08:44] <$RocketShot_> I will
[1:08:45] <YaminoRaiden> P3 also loses in SLs and interactions
[1:08:47] <@Menitta> DAMN
[1:08:53] <+DarkNerdShawny> P4 > P2 > P3.............everything else, irrelevant!
[1:08:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> chie is fucking scary
[1:08:55] <Man_in_the_Red> @mightyjoey2 doodBro
[1:08:56] <@Menitta> @CaptainPileDriver GGs my dude
[1:09:00] <+Story_Ark> oh god P3 sl's are...oof
[1:09:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> ggs @Menitta
[1:09:05] <hamahiroyuki> if you had to pick a secondary s link to be a persona user in p3 and p4? p5 is obvious Hifumi and Sae
[1:09:06] <gnarly_memes_bro> I just don't realisticall think they'll ever do it
[1:09:06] <$RocketShot_> I love those sls
[1:09:08] <+itsjustdoogan> Cant say for sure, still playing P5 and never touched any prior.
[1:09:09] <ArbyW> SMT is superior because it has Dante
[1:09:10] <gustavozxd> @story_ark because of the AI shit? Yeah LUL
[1:09:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> Persona WHO? Persona started with P3 idk what yall are talking about. it was real bold of them to start a franchise with the 3rd game too
[1:09:16] <+RichardMF_> P3 is better because blue is my favorite color
[1:09:17] <%jubejube56> Imagine playing a JRPG where you only control one character in the party.....wouldn't that be ANNOYING?
[1:09:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck the buttons just keep coming when she triggers
[1:09:28] <WhyIDie> we live in an era where anything with an iota of brand recognition will get exhumed from their grave to eventually get remade, it's inevitable
[1:09:31] <SenhorGordon> If it wasn't for Yukiko P4 would have the best characters
[1:09:34] <TigerClaws12> a literal oppression session LUL
[1:09:36] <%wolfofsound> Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken Take the land, that must be taken
[1:09:41] <+Story_Ark> @jubejube56 or being locked out of dungeons after certain points of grinding...
[1:09:42] <LTKonnor> We need a Green Persona
[1:09:42] <+DarkNerdShawny> Another question......what main color do yall want Persona 6 to be?
[1:09:43] <$RocketShot_> @mightyjoey2 I’m the teddie in front of you lol
[1:09:46] <gustavozxd> @jubejube56 not if it's done well, which you know...
[1:09:46] <ArbyW> one more god rejected
[1:09:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @jubejube56 pokemon Kappa
[1:09:53] <$RocketShot_> Purple

[1:09:58] <gnarly_memes_bro> Purple and Green Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:09:58] <%Gadlight> greem
[1:10:01] <OkieToki> green
[1:10:02] <YaminoRaiden> Yukiko is amazing and a lot of people miss the point with her.
[1:10:04] <Drunkengen> We need to make a NEO FEATHERMAN GAME
[1:10:04] <%Gadlight> *green
[1:10:04] <%wujak> @RealRocketShot did you really rage quite earlier, or was it just a dc
[1:10:05] <+Story_Ark> the rest system in p3 is absurd
[1:10:06] <$RocketShot_> Fuck you
[1:10:07] <gustavozxd> purple is my fav color so
[1:10:08] <fuji_92> ps will be green and the musical theme will be bossa nova
[1:10:08] <+DarkNerdShawny> Persona 6 Indigo
[1:10:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> @darknerdshawny Magenta
[1:10:14] <%akira_chong> I say P5 because despite some truly insulting writing, it's the only one where you can realistically play around with your party makeup.
[1:10:17] <fuji_92> *p6
[1:10:17] <%jubejube56> @haveswordmuststing actually the answer is xenoblade chronicles but that works too

[1:12:52] <%jubejube56> P5 is literally a dating sim
[1:12:58] <ArbyW> I'll be honest I don't think we have an answer. @akira_chong
[1:13:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> all persona games are dating sims
[1:13:08] <%wujak> @RealRocketShot i didnt think anyone would rq in a game no one really plays anymore
[1:13:09] <gustavozxd> yukiko making fun of Akihiko? worst girl

[1:14:25] <AThing_> @gustavozxd *Fuhrer who is this hitler you speak of
[1:14:26] <LTKonnor> G O O D T R Y
[1:14:29] <Tekaii00> Persona 6 : PERSONA OR STAND!?
[1:14:33] <%jubejube56> Idk why but I feel like the theme to P$ Dancing All Night is the only song I've heard in years that you can actually dance to
[1:14:38] <%Irridium> man I haven't played this game in five years this gonna be fuckin' rough
[1:14:40] <+violet_city> good tr- good tr- good try
[1:14:41] <+DarkNerdShawny> Hear me out guys.....Persona 5 Arena....Switch exclusive!!! *runs awa*
[1:14:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> its kinda hard to say cuz you could say games like MVC are anime because of the stupid long combos, air dashing and the little neutral but it doesnt look "anime"
[1:14:56] <Drunkengen> Persona 6 Stone Ocean
[1:15:00] <CalliegulaStrems> This is making me want to break out my Teddie but no one to play with
[1:15:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> i know, i just gotta block then punish correctly, it's just infuriating sitting through those fucking buttons
[1:15:01] <+itsjustdoogan> Fan Girl sure can dance
[1:15:09] <gnarly_memes_bro> Persona 6: Stone Personocean
[1:15:10] <$RocketShot_> I’m so pissed that p5s isn’t a port
[1:15:10] <%mightyjoey2> you can set a macro for AC
[1:15:11] <hamahiroyuki> ok lets get the real gas in the fire: who worst boi?
[1:15:17] <LTKonnor> Persona 6: Good Try
[1:15:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yosuke
[1:15:20] <AThing_> Persona 2 Innocent Sin already did the Stone Ocean ending
[1:15:21] <Man_in_the_Red> @hamahiroyuki Yu
[1:15:24] <%jubejube56> @DarkNerdShawny I actually want P5A to have a community soooo....
[1:15:30] <gustavozxd> I don't hate Ken at all
[1:15:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> maybe the power of alcohol will improve my power
[1:15:30] <CalliegulaStrems> Yosuke is kinda shitty towards his teammates but hes still not terrible
[1:15:31] <SenhorGordon> Why is no one picking the best girl Kanji?
[1:15:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> GO FOR THE INSTANT KILL
[1:15:41] <Sokumotanaka> Yo woolie I see you're playing that good, good shit
[1:15:42] <TheGreatestAutismo> Yosuke or Ken
[1:15:45] <$RocketShot_> I fucking hate Ken
[1:15:46] <gustavozxd> ryuji is super generic
[1:15:46] <+Story_Ark> @senhorgordon Kanji is too manly for them
[1:15:56] <OkieToki> ryuji
[1:15:57] <+DarkNerdShawny> Ken is the worst confirmed.
[1:15:59] <$RocketShot_> Ken should have died in p3
[1:16:05] <Tekaii00> Worst boy KEN got the best boy from P3 killed
[1:16:07] <$RocketShot_> And I would’ve been so fine with that
[1:16:08] <fuji_92> btw, I'm replaying hack gu last recode, and Alkaid is just chie... they're even voiced both by Erin PogChamp
[1:16:12] <gustavozxd> Ryuji is "the bro I guess" and that's aaaaall his character
[1:16:17] <+DarkNerdShawny> Ken is even bad in the dancing games and I LOVE EVERYONE IN THE DANCING GAMES
[1:16:21] <%Gadlight> Yuzuke is the best
[1:16:21] <YaminoRaiden> Yosuke is mostly playful when he cracks jokes with his team, and is mostly looking out for everyone.
[1:16:23] <hamahiroyuki> I also despise yosuke with every fiber of my being
[1:16:25] <%mightyjoey2> Ken is one of the best P3 characters
[1:16:26] <CalliegulaStrems> I love Ryuji he is a good boy
[1:16:30] <$RocketShot_> I love yosuke
[1:16:36] <Sokumotanaka> @gustavozxd why would you say something so bold yet controversial?
[1:16:39] <+Story_Ark> chie: "a match between rivals, our fight will be legendary!" yukiko: "LEL DONT BREAK MY FAN"
[1:16:40] <LTKonnor> Good god
[1:16:41] <@Menitta> this is a blowout
[1:16:46] <fuji_92> Ryuji the gooder boy
[1:16:48] <LTKonnor> I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE LUL
[1:16:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> INSTANT kill this boy
[1:16:50] <@Menitta> I must ask you to get the fuck out
[1:16:57] <+Story_Ark> I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE
[1:17:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> RAW INSTANT KILL
[1:17:06] <CalliegulaStrems> He's a friend and has a cool moment near the end and his backstory is interesting and his Japanese voice is amazing
[1:17:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> When Yosuke and Yusuke makes for confusing conversation
[1:17:12] <CalliegulaStrems> and his english voice is amazing
[1:17:20] <%wolfofsound> She doesn't even go here! @WoolieVersus
[1:17:22] <One_More_Beer_> Akechi really made me want to punch him in the face
[1:17:26] <fuji_92> WHY WON'T YOU IK FOLKS? SoonerLater
[1:17:27] <$RocketShot_> Yuri is amazing
[1:17:27] <gustavozxd> @sokumotanaka I just don't like happy flawless characters especially in a series about accepting your "true self" NotLikeThis
[1:17:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Damn Yukiko just threw out her ex like that kinda fucked up... :/
[1:17:39] <+DarkNerdShawny> I love Ysuke and hate Ysuke

[1:17:46] <hamahiroyuki> ryuji just need a good ol' bottle of stfu, otherwise im ok with him
[1:17:47] <+itsjustdoogan> is P3/P4 on PS4 at all?
[1:17:50] <Drunkengen> God i dont like that Akechi is gonna get redemption arc
[1:17:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> @gustavozxd that's a good point
[1:17:52] <Astar_NoName> What is the difference between Personas and Stands? There is a right answer.
[1:17:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> LET'S GO WOOLIE
[1:17:54] <SenhorGordon> "Such a wuus" Chie about loosing to Yukiko
[1:17:54] <+DarkNerdShawny> @itsjustdoogan nope
[1:17:56] <gnarly_memes_bro> I like ryuji more than yosuke, but I'm not gonna act like they don't both come frome the same loaf of plain white bread
[1:17:59] <CalliegulaStrems> I think him being a loudmouth is endearing
[1:18:06] <Sokumotanaka> @gustavozxd I wouldn't say ryuji is "flawless"
[1:18:19] <%jubejube56> @Astar_NoName personas are pokemon, stands are....stands
[1:18:19] <CalliegulaStrems> Also only one game is about accepting your true self
[1:18:20] <+itsjustdoogan> @DarkNerdShawny damn, ty for the answer
[1:18:23] <+saladin1911> Junpei is trash
[1:18:24] <+Story_Ark> kanji!
[1:18:26] <fuji_92> Ryuji is the dumb friend... we all have one, and love them, but that doesn't make him less dumb...
[1:18:27] <SgtSmilies> im... not sure you'll find much for Chie and Yukiko lol
[1:18:29] <@Menitta> yall are playin Chie so Im good
[1:18:29] <%harpo2377> harpo2377 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:18:41] <Man_in_the_Red> Ryuji is so bad he underflows to being amazing
[1:18:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> play Chadji
[1:18:45] <OkieToki> everything dealing with ryuji that is outside of the social link made me so averse to interacting with him that i have not and will not look into his social link
[1:18:45] <Man_in_the_Red> Kappa
[1:18:48] <AThing_> Junpei is even more of a shit as femc since you're closer friends and he still acts like an asshole
[1:18:48] <Astar_NoName> Wrong. Stands are better.
[1:18:49] <fuji_92> ^
[1:18:57] <One_More_Beer_> no shadow aki?
[1:18:58] <fuji_92> wait no
[1:19:03] <gustavozxd> @sokumotanaka well, similar to slice of life anime, anything bad that ryuji does is just a "haha ooh ryuji the dumb good boi"
[1:19:07] <TheGreatestAutismo> Junpei > Ryuji > Yosuke
[1:19:08] <%jubejube56> @Astar_NoName bruh that isn't a difference
[1:19:10] <+Story_Ark> kanji!
[1:19:10] <%jubejube56> I feel cheated
[1:19:16] <TheGreatestAutismo> At least stupei has character
[1:19:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:19:29] <@Menitta> Mountain Dew Chie
[1:19:29] <+DarkNerdShawny> Personas vs Stands?
[1:19:34] <One_More_Beer_> man, people do not like the bro characters
[1:19:37] <el_patronn64> Neat
[1:19:40] <gustavozxd> Eikichi tho
[1:19:44] <ArbyW> Stands
[1:19:51] <Man_in_the_Red> @darknerdshawny is that a question, Legion, obviosly LUL
[1:19:51] <SenhorGordon> Yusuke is best boy
[1:19:58] <@Menitta> No, the green and black
[1:19:59] <Mendin> Teddie is best boy
[1:19:59] <SenhorGordon> With Junpei at number 2
[1:20:00] <AThing_> Eikichi is a bro, but he's a forgotten bro
[1:20:01] <Mendin> And best girl
[1:20:02] <+itsjustdoogan> MT Dew is also Blue
[1:20:04] <%jubejube56> Purple and Green is a Powerade thing
[1:20:05] <CalliegulaStrems> BEST SLINK AND WHY IS IT AKINARI
[1:20:11] <Astar_NoName> I'm willing to dispute it's a difference in terms of endearment and enjoyment.

[1:24:00] <%mightyjoey2> Sweep
[1:24:08] <gustavozxd> Poor Akihiko
[1:24:31] <%jubejube56> I figured this is what Akihiko gameplay looked competatively
[1:24:38] <%jubejube56> looked like*
[1:24:39] <gustavozxd> Holy shit this chie does not stop
[1:24:45] <357Sneak> ttm
[1:24:48] <ArbyW> Yup. that's anime
[1:24:58] <+Story_Ark> god i wish that akihiko were me
[1:24:59] <fuji_92> and that's the match
[1:25:21] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> He didnt touch the ground for like a year
[1:25:34] <fuji_92> 100% PRESSURE ALL DAY
[1:25:45] <ArbyW> IT'S FREE CORNER PRESSURE
[1:25:48] <%jubejube56> @Story_Ark do you just leave the Chie training CPU on at night just to watch?
[1:25:54] <+DarkNerdShawny> Yikes. This player's scary
[1:25:55] <gustavozxd> ouch
[1:26:26] <gustavozxd> corner switch combo NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:26:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:27] <YaminoRaiden> Yu, Labrys, and Marie can be nuts
[1:26:30] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Sokumotanaka
[1:26:32] <%jubejube56> Pretty sure Yu is rather technical
[1:26:34] <%wujak> ken and yukari imo
[1:26:34] <gustavozxd> Junpei has some dumb shit I know of
[1:26:43] <+Story_Ark> @jubejube56 ...maybe
[1:26:43] <el_patronn64> Aigis I think
[1:26:48] <ManEaterPug> rise can get wils
[1:26:51] <BanjoFighter> aigis
[1:26:52] <alephalpha> shadow labrys and aigis
[1:26:55] <FluxWaveZ> Ken, Aigis, Yukari, S. Labrys were pretty technical
[1:26:58] <gustavozxd> I have no idea what Aigis is supposed to be
[1:27:00] <Man_in_the_Red> @jubejube56 his final super is
[1:27:02] <fuji_92> yu is technical, but then there's ziocar
[1:27:05] <+RichardMF_> Ken is also a big puppet character with the dog
[1:27:17] <alephalpha> ken as well
[1:27:25] <OtterSlinger> @Sokumotanaka To be fair, as a Morgana lover, Morgana was chewing him out the whole game, and was preying on his vulnerability as well. The yosuke thing is bullshit tho
[1:27:27] <Sokumotanaka> @caligulatwitch Look find ryuji's loudness endearing all you want, that's fine but also realize ryuji is an asshole, he's the bully he didn't get to be in the past.
[1:28:05] <%jubejube56> All this technical breakdown when all you need to do is spam instakill with Kanji
[1:28:10] <%jubejube56> the ultimate flowchart
[1:28:13] <Astar_NoName> I personally find Persona4 a hard game to just watch, are the mechanics hard to understand or is it just a unique style of play? Can someone explain the game to me.
[1:28:13] <fuji_92> ^
[1:28:22] <@Menitta> Spam instakill is the only way to play games tbh
[1:28:26] <Sokumotanaka> @OtterSlinger morgana only chewed him out when he did something stupid and the fact of the matter is the cat apologizes and ryuji never does
[1:28:28] <fireking900> now watch Paige lol
[1:28:32] <Sokumotanaka> the CAT is more mature
[1:28:42] <+Story_Ark> ya know, i love persona, chie specifically, and sometimes its so daunting to get good at this game
[1:28:47] <%akira_chong> All I hear about Ryuji and Morgana is *angry 12-year-old noises*
[1:28:50] <%DedlokPM> fact that the top recommended video on the last video had a thumbnail of Paige eating Spaghetti was hilarious
[1:28:51] <OkieToki> i did not like ryuji OR morgana.
[1:29:09] <TheGreatestAutismo> Morgana is a little shit though
[1:29:09] <TigerClaws12> all that koolaid
[1:29:22] <%jubejube56> woa imagine akihiko getting a new punch
[1:29:24] <gustavozxd> @astar_noname do you find MVC3 hard to watch? it could be that it's just really fast, other than that, idk
[1:29:34] <AThing_> I think we can all agree that Koromaru was the truest bro
[1:29:42] <TheGreatestAutismo> His thing with Ann got stale pretty quick too
[1:29:43] <+itsjustdoogan> *might need to turn away from chat to avoid potential P5 spoilers, though no direct example has been given*
[1:29:52] <OtterSlinger> @Sokumotanaka He repeatedly calls Ryuji Useless and Stupid, to the point it's even in his battle narration.
[1:30:02] <%DedlokPM> ZA WARUDO
[1:30:07] <Haarute> LEARNING.
[1:30:13] <Astar_NoName> Yeah, I think it might just come down to a lack of understanding of mechanics in both.
[1:30:18] <gustavozxd> p5 characters are all slice of life tropes with almost no character development
[1:30:33] <gustavozxd> Futaba had the most I guess
[1:31:16] <Sokumotanaka> @OtterSlinger I just told you about his character growth. get better reading comprehension: he apologizes for that and at the point in the game futaba is the narrator so what's your complaint?
[1:31:17] <alephalpha> you know who were great characters ... tbe P2 characters
[1:31:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Game Chumps ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:31:29] <gustavozxd> I feel like the social links being side content ruins a bit of the character development that could happen, like persona 2
[1:31:34] <%jubejube56> @alephalpha they couldn't even get a Mii Costume in smash bros
[1:31:34] <fuji_92> who characters?
[1:31:39] <+MayorRev> "fuck u game chumps" -dunkey
[1:31:53] <@Menitta> I'm surprised there arent waifu wars in chat but instead ryuji wars
[1:32:05] <Sokumotanaka> @alephalpha maya was top tier!
[1:32:05] <AThing_> Ryuji is the only waifu that matters
[1:32:12] <TheGreatestAutismo> Nah, you missed them @menitta
[1:32:13] <fuji_92> ^.
[1:32:16] <OkieToki> ^
[1:32:16] <@Menitta> Oh
[1:32:17] <alephalpha> 3 had stuff like shinji and ken getting tbeir ultimate personas by coming to terms with shinjiros death but yeah
[1:32:18] <@Menitta> welp
[1:32:18] <OtterSlinger> I genuinely don't remember the time Morgana apologized, but my memory's shit so I probably just forgot it
[1:32:22] <%jubejube56> @Menitta you can't have a war when you are surrounded by a Chie cult
[1:32:35] <@Menitta> Good, we're in agreement then Kappa
[1:32:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> I played through P5 twice I dont remember either
[1:32:45] <OkieToki> i also do not remember morgana apologizing
[1:32:46] <Man_in_the_Red> Igor is the best waifu, we can all agree on that at least Kappa
[1:32:46] <TheGreatestAutismo> I'm still salty Marie wasn't the main answer when worst girl came up
[1:32:49] <fuji_92> there's that, 90% of the chat is chie followers
[1:32:59] <OkieToki> i forgot about marie, she IS the worst
[1:33:05] <gustavozxd> @alephalpha see that's the thing, they don't have side content social links
[1:33:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> @thegreatestautismo people would have to remember her in order to bring her up
[1:33:12] <fuji_92> Marie is okay tbh, i dont get all the hate
[1:33:14] <+itsjustdoogan> Describe Marie in a word
[1:33:19] <OkieToki> forced
[1:33:20] <Man_in_the_Red> isnt the new girl for P5R is Marie again
[1:33:21] <TheGreatestAutismo> LUL
[1:33:22] <alephalpha> yeah I'm agreeing
[1:33:22] <@Menitta> incompetent
[1:33:27] <%jubejube56> You know what Marie has a lot of problems, but I think if you take her exclusively from P4A she is good
[1:33:27] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:33:28] <YaminoRaiden> Marie is a great character.
[1:33:32] <Sokumotanaka> @FuqBoiSlim I played it 4 times and saw it each time so maybe clean your eyes
[1:33:37] <OtterSlinger> I think we can all agree though
[1:33:37] <@Menitta> Marie is fine, shes just poochie
[1:33:48] <%jubejube56> her design is great in this game and her annoying swallowing of the story isn't prevalent in this game
[1:33:48] <OtterSlinger> ... wait that's a pretty late game event, nevermind
[1:33:51] <Sokumotanaka> marie suuuuck
[1:34:05] <gustavozxd> they can hit characters harder if it's main content, if it's side content they can't hit characters too hard, cause they have to feel good in the main story at all times
[1:34:07] <@Menitta> please be nice in chat
[1:34:12] <+Story_Ark> whenever Marie's not on screen, the other characters should be asking, wheres Marie?
[1:34:21] <fuji_92> ^
[1:34:29] <YaminoRaiden> ?
[1:34:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Marie died on her way back to the velvet room
[1:34:31] <prime_name> Oh hey, Gam Goomps
[1:34:33] <@Menitta> Oh my god that recapture
[1:34:33] <Man_in_the_Red> @menitta in a Persona stream, no way doodStare
[1:34:43] <Sokumotanaka> @Menitta Oh no Im nice but marie is not a good character let's be rela
[1:34:48] <%akira_chong> I'mma be real with you guys: Persona's the worst.
[1:34:48] <Kalinflip> GG
[1:34:55] <AThing_> Persona, a game series about friendship, will bring out the worst in us.
[1:35:00] <gustavozxd> @akira_chong D:
[1:35:02] <+Story_Ark> Marie: fuse your personas...TO THE EXTREME!
[1:35:05] <@Menitta> Lets not pretend each other. Entertainment is trash
[1:35:13] <OkieToki> all entertainment is bad
[1:35:13] <Man_in_the_Red> @akira_chong you know what, Video games are the worst
[1:35:14] <+itsjustdoogan> @AThing_ that seems accurate
[1:35:14] <fuji_92> hot take: hitler is the worst girl
[1:35:21] <usurper_sos> Is Persona even considered entertainment Kappa
[1:35:24] <Sokumotanaka> @Menitta fair point
[1:35:29] <%wolfofsound> man I'd lover to tenderize her meat Kreygasm
[1:35:29] <TheGreatestAutismo> Anime should be banned tbf
[1:35:32] <AThing_> Yeah hitler from P2 really was a trash waifu.
[1:35:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm probably not gonna get to fight woolie tonight
[1:35:43] <+Story_Ark> "chie" "tender" "meat"
[1:35:49] <gustavozxd> Hitler's theme in p2 though
[1:35:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @DrivenDust
[1:35:56] <prime_name> Oooo, Sppedrun
[1:36:01] <+itsjustdoogan> They named a character Hitler? or am I ruining a joke
[1:36:02] <@Menitta> Nah you probably will. The line is definitely gonna be shorter than DBZ or Blazblue
[1:36:07] <%akira_chong> @haveswordmuststing except FORTNITE Fortnite is the BEST
[1:36:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> I like how we looped backed to the anti-japanese sentiments from the 50s because anime's just that bad
[1:36:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, it's just my dad want's to go see a movie together
[1:36:19] <+Story_Ark> @itsjustdoogan Persona 2 literally had Hitler as a boss
[1:36:21] <YaminoRaiden> @athing_ I too remember when this series taught us to face our worst traits so that we could accept others wholely.
[1:36:23] <TheGreatestAutismo> @itsjustdoogan hitler is literally in P2
[1:36:26] <@Menitta> oooh
[1:36:32] <%wujak> this is p4a again btw
[1:36:34] <%mightyjoey2> That’s vanilla
[1:36:40] <+itsjustdoogan> Great Awesome xD @TheGreatestAutismo
[1:36:41] <gustavozxd> @itsjustdoogan PS1 persona 2 (Japan only) had hitler, like the actual Hitler coming back from the past, they removed him in the psp rerelease though
[1:36:41] <fuji_92> that's vanilla wools
[1:36:43] <+Story_Ark> except in the localization they gave him sunglasses and called him Fuher
[1:36:45] <alephalpha> vanilla
[1:36:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> unless i convince him to have a guys night on the 4rth
[1:36:51] <AThing_> @itsjustdoogan Not to spoil P2 IS, but hitler and the SS take up a major part of the 2nd half of the story.
[1:36:52] <@Menitta> @CaptainPileDriver Go see Yesterday its a good movie
[1:36:55] <fuji_92> yellow is vanilla
[1:36:57] <+Story_Ark> real talk, Elizabeth is underrated
[1:37:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> well, we like horror movies so we were thinking new child's play
[1:37:10] <TheGreatestAutismo> She good
[1:37:11] <+Jaysky> Underrated how?
[1:37:13] <Sokumotanaka> who said that? elizabeth here would destroy dio
[1:37:16] <gustavozxd> persona 2 IS on psp is not Hitler in all versions afaik
[1:37:17] <%jubejube56> Y'know I heard the original plot of Yesterday was meant to be a depressing drama
[1:37:17] <+TheGooseChase> omg best fighting game
[1:37:18] <%akira_chong> Seriously, anime fighters are trash. I'm just here for Fantasy Strike
[1:37:21] <+xgreenxroomx> Hey guys
[1:37:21] <+itsjustdoogan> @AThing_ allgood, seems unlikely Il get to touch it unless remake happens
[1:37:21] <TheGreatestAutismo> but Elizabeth can't compete with Mitsuru
[1:37:22] <alephalpha> I think woolie said he wanted to try them might as well not spoil stuff
[1:37:25] <+Story_Ark> YOU CAN DO THAT!?
[1:37:30] <YaminoRaiden> Elizabeth is NOT underrated. She's the favorite.
[1:37:32] <%wolfofsound> WITCHCRAFT
[1:37:38] <Astar_NoName> But, URRRRRYYYYYYYY!
[1:37:39] <@Menitta> lol
[1:37:45] <+TheGooseChase> Grand Finals for Ultimax was Margaret vs Ken, no?
[1:37:47] <+Story_Ark> i always thought Mitsuru was the favorite
[1:37:51] <AThing_> @itsjustdoogan Well, without saying much, rumors become reality. I think you can put two and two together to find out where hitler comes in
[1:37:52] <%wujak> yukiko is not great in this game
[1:37:52] <+Jaysky> Kanji matches are hype
[1:37:52] <+itsjustdoogan> @xgreenxroomx hello
[1:37:55] <fuji_92> Elizabeth or Margaret chat?
[1:38:01] <gustavozxd> thank God there's no Marie Rose like girl in any persona game
[1:38:02] <fireking900> who wants to see a trash bag on stage?

[1:38:38] <gustavozxd> HELL YEAH AIGIS
[1:38:41] <GeltonZ> Quality of the recording is inversely proportional to quality of the combat
[1:38:44] <ManEaterPug> Vanillaaaa
[1:38:48] <gunzerkingdunce> Do people ever actually use Aigis' super Orgia mode?
[1:38:51] <%akira_chong> I shoulda been here for Mortal Kombat 11 a while back
[1:38:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> I ASKED FOR STRAWBERRY NO VANILLA

[1:39:58] <%jubejube56> ah yes Ogre live
[1:39:59] <fuji_92> VANILLA
[1:40:03] <%jubejube56> the premier FGC stream
[1:40:05] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus yeah, Persona 4 Arena was Persona 4 Ultimate. Persona 4 Ultimax was PERSONA 4 THE ULTIMAX ULTRA SUPLEX HOLD
[1:40:25] <Sokumotanaka> oh god for p5 ultimax we may get a new loser oc
[1:40:32] <gustavozxd> "orgia" is just orgy in portugues, i was very confused back in the day
[1:40:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:40:35] <$RocketShot_> Never gonna happen
[1:40:39] <$RocketShot_> Nevergonna be one
[1:40:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> no one cares about yukiko
[1:40:48] <+itsjustdoogan> @Sokumotanaka worse than new sonic?
[1:41:03] <%wolfofsound> truly confirming that chie is best girl
[1:41:04] <gunzerkingdunce> @sokumotanaka eh, we get one for every spinoff
[1:41:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> >more spin off loser OCs that show up for one game only ResidentSleeper
[1:41:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> yukiko suuuuuuuucks
[1:41:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> in persona 4
[1:41:21] <Sokumotanaka> @itsjustdoogan sho IS worse than new sonic\
[1:41:22] <gunzerkingdunce> Least Minazuki plays ok enough
[1:41:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> not the fighting game
[1:41:24] <fireking900> fuck yukiko
[1:41:29] <LibriJamm> In a game all about pressure yuki drowns.
[1:41:29] <YaminoRaiden> in character, she beats Chie for me.
[1:41:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> I DON'T WANT TO RUN THE INN
[1:41:31] <+doublexpwiikend> the fighting game she isn't the best either tho
[1:41:39] <TheGreatestAutismo> Yukiko is like, mid-tier waifu in p4
[1:41:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> except now that i do cause i want to i guess
[1:41:41] <$cherubs_anonymous> I solely don't like Yukiko because her VAs kinda shitty person
[1:41:47] <AThing_> She is phoebe
[1:41:47] <gustavozxd> @yaminoraiden you picked the wrong chatroom to say that LUL
[1:41:48] <fuji_92> nah, yukiko is okay as a character... I hated her more, but now she's fine
[1:41:48] <+AmanDotZip> wind is blowing in 2 different directions???
[1:41:53] <killerking> not really
[1:41:54] <TheGreatestAutismo> party members pale compared to Naoto tho
[1:41:55] <gunzerkingdunce> But man we really need a P5 Arena, not P5 Musou, ugh
[1:41:58] <YaminoRaiden> Thing is, she isn't even dumb.
[1:42:02] <Sokumotanaka> P3 cast > P4 cast
[1:42:09] <TheGreatestAutismo> ^^^
[1:42:15] <+doublexpwiikend> i mean in general it's not that yukiko is bad, everyone else is just so much better than her
[1:42:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> U think Yukiko's into femdom asking for a friend in discord
[1:42:20] <alephalpha> ^^^
[1:42:28] <gunzerkingdunce> Yea
[1:42:28] <fuji_92> @agentpigmcpig yup
[1:42:31] <+itsjustdoogan> @Sokumotanaka Im eagerly awaiting watching that trash fire. Going in with the intention of poking fun at it
[1:42:31] <+Story_Ark> yukiko's va is shitty?
[1:42:34] <%jubejube56> Remember that time people liked Fuuka?
[1:42:43] <alephalpha> I agree sokumotanaka
[1:42:43] <TheGreatestAutismo> LUL
[1:42:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> who-ka?
[1:42:46] <gunzerkingdunce> OI
[1:42:46] <AThing_> hey, people still like fuuka
[1:42:50] <AThing_> Not me tho
[1:42:51] <hamahiroyuki> yukari is the the Rachel of p3
[1:42:57] <+Story_Ark> @jubejube56 i only did because she was short hair tbh
[1:42:59] <fuji_92> yukiko va is legend
[1:43:01] <@Menitta> I dont care for P3 at all tbh
[1:43:08] <+RichardMF_> you need to be a badass to talk to fuuka
[1:43:09] <gustavozxd> fuuka is like haru, she's just there sometimes I guess, at least haru looks cute af
[1:43:13] <+Jaysky> Why you gotta beat on Chie?
[1:43:16] <%jubejube56> @Story_Ark you would like a rock if I put a short hair'd wig on it
[1:43:19] <gunzerkingdunce> The Fuuka bazooka train is still strong, better than Yukari
[1:43:26] <zamzoph> stop it Woolie BibleThump
[1:43:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> anybody want to go to the boss lobby online cause i don't know what a boss character in this game looks like
[1:43:27] <TheGreatestAutismo> Haru is best party member in P5
[1:43:27] <AThing_> @gurrren_lagannn She's a stone-cold bitch it's true
[1:43:28] <fuji_92> P3 cast has some great folks, but others that are just forgettable tbh
[1:43:34] <TheGreatestAutismo> don't you compare her to fuuka
[1:43:35] <+doublexpwiikend> yeah but that's because Yuukari is yuukari
[1:43:39] <@Menitta> Yukiko's VA is great she smokes weed
[1:43:42] <gustavozxd> like 2 or 3 hours of persona talk and p2 characters were mentioned more than fuuka and haru LUL
[1:43:46] <+itsjustdoogan> Domestic Violence the game, poor Chie
[1:43:47] <%Solidnick18> man i remember doing akihiko combos one day for this
[1:43:48] <+Jaysky> Haru is definitely a good party member
[1:43:54] <Tekaii00> ok chat best Velvet room attendent?
[1:43:57] <+Story_Ark> @jubejube56 yes
[1:43:59] <+doublexpwiikend> a good party member yes
[1:44:00] <TheGreatestAutismo> She had the best mementos lines
[1:44:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> I can fit my entire smt collection on Haru's 4head 4Head
[1:44:04] <alephalpha> elizabeth
[1:44:05] <@Menitta> that wall bounce is nuts
[1:44:07] <+doublexpwiikend> but i found her social link lacking tbh
[1:44:09] <%jubejube56> well...at least you own it
[1:44:09] <gunzerkingdunce> That being said, Aigis was still the best in P3. Yeah I'd stick my dick in a toaster
[1:44:16] <gustavozxd> and haru has like my fav design but story wise she does nothing at all
[1:44:19] <YaminoRaiden> Haru is literally held back by her own game. Even in skills she has TOO MANY
[1:44:21] <fireking900> @Tekaii00 i like the twins
[1:44:33] <@Menitta> the twins would be amazing in P5A
[1:44:33] <alephalpha> aigis is fantastic
[1:44:43] <+Jaysky> I liked her social link, but she was way too late into the game and you barely got any interaction prior to her joining your party
[1:44:44] <%jubejube56> Haru does have the best All Out Attack
[1:44:47] <Sokumotanaka> Not enough aigis lewds
[1:44:51] <TheGreatestAutismo> Tae is the best girl ever introduced into Persona, however
[1:44:53] <%jubejube56> outside of maybe Joker and Morgana
[1:44:58] <gustavozxd> Aigis va is one of my fav of all time
[1:45:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> @thegreatestautismo no lies detected
[1:45:06] <gunzerkingdunce> @jaysky that's just an issue with the persona games in general
[1:45:12] <Sokumotanaka> @TheGreatestAutismo HA HA HA Maya destroys her
[1:45:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> the twins would beat you with nightsticks then they'd have a dragon install of them fusing to become one
[1:45:16] <gonvern15> @tekaii00 Egor
[1:45:19] <+Jaysky> Had the same issue with Naoto
[1:45:20] <fuji_92> by sheer amount, P5 has the most top waifus of all games
[1:45:27] <hamahiroyuki> word on street is mona and ryuji bickering at each other ate haru's screen time for decent devoplement
[1:45:32] <+Jaysky> Naoto's great (not a good party member imo) but comes in late
[1:45:33] <TheGreatestAutismo> @sokumotanaka >Maya LUL LUL LUL
[1:45:33] <AThing_> Nah, jun best p2 waifu
[1:45:35] <gustavozxd> Oh no man best p5 girl is the yukari teacher already forgot her name fuck me
[1:45:37] <@Menitta> the twins would be Ice Climber x Carl Clover levels of dumb
[1:45:42] <gunzerkingdunce> There's a weeeeird line between links and story since one happens at the players choosing
[1:45:50] <gustavozxd> @athing_ YE YE
[1:45:52] <alephalpha> quantity over quality, Fujiwara?
[1:45:52] <+doublexpwiikend> while there are more choices, that doesn't mean all of them are good
[1:45:53] <%jubejube56> @gustavozxd kawakami?
[1:45:55] <Sokumotanaka> @AThing_ only like girls bro
[1:46:05] <gustavozxd> @jubejube56 yes thank you
[1:46:15] <+itsjustdoogan> Im only aware of Aigis in the concept of the meme "Whoa! Yes! Hello! welcome to my personal space. Can I help you?"
[1:46:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> you mean like all the velvet room attendants in this game cause they are all stupid good
[1:46:18] <+doublexpwiikend> dam u said she was best and didn't even know her name
[1:46:21] <@Menitta> I like Makoto she likes Yakuza
[1:46:21] <gustavozxd> most fucked up S Link but damn I love her
[1:46:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think they made naoto better in golden but I never played vanilla so I dont know firsthand
[1:46:39] <+MayorRev> BACK BACK OVER HERE
[1:46:43] <Sokumotanaka> @Menitta a woman of refine taste
[1:46:44] <+doublexpwiikend> they supposedly did but yeah i never noticed either
[1:46:48] <%jubejube56> @gustavozxd but that's the best ppart
[1:46:50] <AThing_> @Menitta Honeslty, that's kinda why I chose her in P5 as well
[1:46:52] <fireking900> Futaba is best girl but Tea is waifu
[1:47:02] <hamahiroyuki> excuse me, is there a link for woolie's discord?
[1:47:13] <+doublexpwiikend> futaba is a neckbeard in the body of a 14 year old
[1:47:13] <AThing_> Yakuza and a motorcycle? Sure, why not
[1:47:18] <gunzerkingdunce> New girl Kasumi might beat Makoto ngl
[1:47:19] <fuji_92> Tae and Kawakami <3
[1:47:22] <TheGreatestAutismo> I want Naoto to spoil every mystery/thriller we watch together
[1:47:28] <gustavozxd> @jubejube56 lmao that was one of the best dialogue choices
[1:47:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> if we somehow get to the online matches before 9 i would like a first crack cause i want to go to the movies with my dad since we haven't done that in awhile
[1:47:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:32] <%jubejube56> @Agentpigmcpig she is a neckbeard but with the power of anime aging
[1:47:37] <%Wool> wait I just started watching the stream, is Woolie learning how to IAD
[1:47:51] <@Menitta> @hamahiroyuki theres the one on r/twobestfriendsplay
[1:48:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> chat's full of impeccable taste tonight much better than the podcast chat PowerUpL EleGiggle PowerUpR
[1:48:19] <+doublexpwiikend> @jubejube56 what if she is a neckbeard that got isekai'd into his favorite game and now is unrealistically good at hacking because he was going to study comp sci in college
[1:48:22] <hamahiroyuki> @Menitta thank you
[1:48:26] <+EndgameContent> Over hAH
[1:48:26] <gustavozxd> are the p1 characters any good? does anyone know at all?
[1:48:28] <alephalpha> okay but what about the guys
[1:48:28] <%jubejube56> @FuqBoiSlim I mean at the time the podcast airs, you are in primetime plebchat
[1:48:29] <@Menitta> np
[1:48:29] <gunzerkingdunce> Really wish I could date one of the guys in P5 tho ngl
[1:48:30] <TheGreatestAutismo> Tae Takemi is such a perfect waifu, her theme is remixed in the final boss theme
[1:48:35] <fuji_92> WoolieVs chat > castle super beats chat
[1:48:42] <fuji_92> *beast
[1:48:48] <alephalpha> the p1 characters were good when they appeared in two
[1:48:48] <gunzerkingdunce> Not Akechi, I'd prefer the option to put a bullet in him
[1:48:49] <AThing_> @gustavozxd The only good ones are the one in P2, because p2 makes them more interesting
[1:48:52] <%wolfofsound> I will admit I'm less of a degenerate than in pat's chat
[1:48:53] <+itsjustdoogan> Well, I must bow out for tonight. Early day tomorrow. Night all
[1:48:53] <+Jaysky> Don't care for Tae too much. She hot though.
[1:49:00] <OkieToki> ^
[1:49:01] <@Menitta> Castle Super Beats: The CSB Rhythm Game
[1:49:06] <%jubejube56> @Agentpigmcpig dammit I'm sure I've heard of 5 anime and a Light Novel with that plot
[1:49:08] <+doublexpwiikend> @gustavozxd from the 1 hour i played they seem ok but the game as is is too bad to bother playing
[1:49:22] <fuji_92> Pat's chat brings the worst in all of us, but in a good way
[1:49:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Bore-o Akechi ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:49:30] <OkieToki> would have liked to see a yusuke romance route
[1:49:36] <+ratearth> the best girl is none of them because they're 15 👮♂️
[1:49:38] <AThing_> P1's final boss tho is a doozy. Look up Pandora if you want to see that crazy shit
[1:49:39] <TheLinguicaGuy> The world
[1:49:42] <Sokumotanaka> When are we gonna get an actual black persona user atlus, make up for that mark fiasco
[1:49:43] <+Jaysky> All become gremlins under the gremlin king
[1:49:47] <%wolfofsound> In my defense pat plays games with monster girls and I can't hide my filth
[1:49:49] <AThing_> @scolopaxminor that's very true
[1:49:53] <gunzerkingdunce> Let me be there for my boy Ryuji
[1:49:54] <+doublexpwiikend> @jubejube56 she's a slightly less powerful kirito
[1:49:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> and the easy mode you have to play as pat who has no rythem
[1:49:57] <fuji_92> @scolopaxminor Tae and Kawakami ain't 15
[1:49:58] <Jathspuh> Wrong order
[1:50:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sokumotanaka when they make a game that doesn't take place in Japan
[1:50:05] <$RocketShot_> So is there a fem mc in p5r or no
[1:50:08] <+doublexpwiikend> @Sokumotanaka maybe when they make another persona in the US
[1:50:10] <gunzerkingdunce> Be there by blowing him
[1:50:16] <Man_in_the_Red> @realrocketshot just a Marie i think
[1:50:16] <AThing_> @RealRocketShot No, it's a new character
[1:50:19] <%Irridium> @RealRocketShot sadly not
[1:50:24] <$RocketShot_> Damn
[1:50:24] <@Menitta> I really want American Persona
[1:50:31] <gustavozxd> hey the first time I played p3 and 4 I was 13 so
[1:50:31] <%jubejube56> @Agentpigmcpig true, she didn't really build a Harem
[1:50:33] <+doublexpwiikend> but can we romance morgana?
[1:50:41] <$RocketShot_> Why would you
[1:50:41] <Man_in_the_Red> @menitta i think thats Mass Effect(?)
[1:50:43] <Jathspuh> Knock down, world, c. l, j. m
[1:50:43] <+Jaysky> A cat is fine too
[1:50:44] <%Irridium> please do not fuck the cat
[1:50:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta we did, it was ann, that's as close as we will ever get
[1:50:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> a cat is fine too...
[1:50:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> sadly.
[1:50:47] <$RocketShot_> He’d just tell you to go to bed
[1:50:48] <TheGreatestAutismo> Now, time for the big boy discussion
[1:50:52] <AThing_> Pls no fuck morgana
[1:50:52] <+ratearth> @realrocketshot why wouldn't you
[1:50:57] <TheGreatestAutismo> Catherine or Katherine?
[1:51:01] <alephalpha> @menitta time to learn to code, art, and music
[1:51:03] <gunzerkingdunce> Qatherine
[1:51:07] <+ratearth> Atlus please give the furries one thing
[1:51:07] <$RocketShot_> @scolopaxminor cuz he’d just tell you to go to bed all of the time
[1:51:08] <+doublexpwiikend> @jubejube56 that we saw, remember, they had to make US look like the main character even tho futaba did all the important stuff in the endgame to save us
[1:51:11] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:51:12] <+itsjustdoogan> @TheGreatestAutismo Quathrine
[1:51:18] <gunzerkingdunce> Much cuter
[1:51:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> chat, you look tired, maybe you should go to bed
[1:51:19] <gustavozxd> @realrocketshot I can easily see that being used as a sex joke
[1:51:34] <$RocketShot_> @gustavozxd which one
[1:51:39] <$RocketShot_> Oh nvm
[1:51:43] <%jubejube56> @Agentpigmcpig psh she didn't have a cool giant gun though
[1:51:44] <+Story_Ark> Jokers fursona is already in Sonic Forces
[1:51:45] <$RocketShot_> Got it
[1:51:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> Catherine is for boys; Katherine is for men and Qatherine is for Gods
[1:51:48] <AThing_> The only one who can save you from Morgana telling you to go to bed is Kawakami.
[1:51:49] <fireking900> Quathrine us the correct choice
[1:51:52] <Sokumotanaka> @FuqBoiSlim Cause there's never been a black guy in japan before Kappa Kappa
[1:52:04] <$RocketShot_> ^
[1:52:04] <+doublexpwiikend> @jubejube56 and neither did kirito ;) think abt it
[1:52:05] <TheGreatestAutismo> Quatherine doesn't wear glasses though
[1:52:22] <+Jaysky> Senpai told me not to listen to the mean cat so I can do more stuff
[1:52:34] <blackmagemasher> who's woolies company?
[1:52:35] <AThing_> Ok, real talk, is Catherine an SMT game? I say yes, because it has an alignment system.
[1:52:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> shhh, you look tired, you should go to bed.
[1:52:44] <alephalpha> wasn't miss jqpan
[1:52:52] <+Jaysky> VoteNay
[1:52:52] <+doublexpwiikend> i wouldn't put it past atlus to make it smt
[1:52:56] <gustavozxd> p3 and 4 do the same thing but without a character telling you to sleep, it's interesting how with Morgana it's more annoying
[1:53:00] <+doublexpwiikend> especially with how the ending is
[1:53:03] <+steak_bentley> trial of the dragon
[1:53:03] <TheGreatestAutismo> Catherine is more SMT than post-3 Persona
[1:53:15] <%jubejube56> @AThing_ next I feel like you are going to argue that a hotdog is a sandwich
[1:53:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's cause it's a fucking snarky cat telling you to go to bed even though you KNOW you didn't do shit
[1:53:20] <fireking900> Quathrine is trans isnt she? Or am I thinking of the Erika thing
[1:53:28] <hamahiroyuki> cant find the woolie discord in the sbfp\r, i dont usually use reddit
[1:53:28] <+ratearth> Erika
[1:53:28] <TheGreatestAutismo> that's erika
[1:53:29] <seylumiue> Thats Erika
[1:53:31] <+doublexpwiikend> nah she's straight up female
[1:53:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> We'll see in the SMT5 DLC mission where you go through all the other game universes and end up in the bar
[1:53:35] <+Jaysky> Honestly I never found Morgana annoying. It was only until after I beat Persona 5 that I found people really hated that
[1:53:36] <Sokumotanaka> @gustavozxd Like pat said it's because there's a chracter telling you
[1:53:37] <+steak_bentley> 5 gets pretty smt at points
[1:53:38] <+itsjustdoogan> Hotdog is a sandwich
[1:53:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> i can see people hating morgana cause he's telling you to go to bed instead of the character
[1:54:00] <gustavozxd> @sokumotanaka yep I know that, which I find it really funny but it does make sense
[1:54:01] <gunzerkingdunce> If I recall, Qatherine identifies as male? but it didn't really matter cuz they technically didn't start with a gender
[1:54:04] <%jubejube56> shut it doogan, no sacrilege in chat
[1:54:15] <+itsjustdoogan> change my mind
[1:54:26] <@Menitta> one of these days I'll actually play P3 to completion
[1:54:30] <+doublexpwiikend> i disliked his character tbh
[1:54:30] <+Jaysky> Cat is just keeping your health in mind
[1:54:30] <fireking900> man that whole ending thing with Erika is still fucked to me
[1:54:33] <gustavozxd> afaik the qatherine storyline is something about protag man running away cause dick?
[1:54:33] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:54:34] <+steak_bentley> yeah i was under the impression rin was just a crossdressing guy
[1:54:39] <Sokumotanaka> I wonder if they remade p4 and one of your waifu's told you to go to bed would they become the most hated?
[1:54:39] <%jubejube56> I don't need to change your mind, I just need you to never spread your opinion ever again and I will live in the echo chamber forever
[1:54:42] <Sokumotanaka> MAke it marie
[1:54:45] <BusterRepukken> qatherine is an alien
[1:54:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta same, but, idk, i can't get over that not controlling party, honestly
[1:54:47] <Sokumotanaka> she's already at the bottom
[1:54:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> If a subs are sandwiches then hot dogs are sandwiches
[1:54:52] <+doublexpwiikend> he got on ryuji's case from the start and then got big mad when ryuji would do the same
[1:54:56] <+RichardMF_> hotdog is not a sandwich because the bun is one piece
[1:55:00] <gunzerkingdunce> @fireking900 it was just before her transition, she still goes through with it
[1:55:02] <@Menitta> I had more issues with the characters @CaptainPileDriver
[1:55:02] <+itsjustdoogan> @jubejube56 as you were then, lol
[1:55:02] <+Story_Ark> shit...hot dogs are just a form of sub. .
[1:55:11] <Man_in_the_Red> Hotdogs with cheese is basically a ham and cheese Kappa
[1:55:11] <%jubejube56> dammit chat....
[1:55:16] <+Jaysky> Not just me then @Menitta , I've tried playing FES and then the PSP one. Dropped in the same spot
[1:55:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> but so are some subs
[1:55:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta like what? i only got like, just past the tutorial and that was it
[1:55:27] <+Story_Ark> but what if the hot dog buns split?
[1:55:30] <gustavozxd> @captainpiledriver you can play p3p, only thing you'll miss is Junpei's best moment ever which is only in 3fes
[1:55:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Does a sub stop being a sandwich because the bread is still attached??
[1:55:39] <+itsjustdoogan> @gurrren_lagannn ty lol
[1:55:46] <TheGreatestAutismo> P3FES is for MEN
[1:55:48] <+RichardMF_> @story_ark your hot dog broke then
[1:55:50] <Man_in_the_Red> @story_ark then you have a hotdog to eat on the floor
[1:55:54] <+Jaysky> I dropped FES cause I couldn't control the characters in battle, then I dropped the PSP one cause they took out cutscenes and replaced it with screenshots.
[1:55:56] <Astar_NoName> But you could argue sandwiches have sliced meats
[1:55:57] <Sokumotanaka> @gustavozxd Nah play fes you miss koromaru's best moment
[1:56:05] <+doublexpwiikend> i should of played fes before p5
[1:56:05] <Sokumotanaka> remived in p3p for some reaosn
[1:56:07] <alephalpha> @fireking900 yeah I feel you
[1:56:07] <YaminoRaiden> @gustavozxd if you mean the revival thing, p3p has it.
[1:56:14] <fireking900> @gunzerkingdunce wait really? thats great now im excited for that game again
[1:56:15] <hamahiroyuki> btw was there an actual witch that had powers over sand that invented the sandwich?
[1:56:16] <%DedlokPM> Chie with a green and purple color scheme with yellow and black pins on her jacket? Can you get even more Woolie Bait? woolieYE
[1:56:21] <+doublexpwiikend> it feels awful going from the best gameplay persona to the worse
[1:56:23] <+Story_Ark> i mean just the part where the buns are attached, the hot dog is still in tact but now its more of a sausage sandwich
[1:56:25] <%jubejube56> A hotdog is still a hotdog if you place it inside a bun
[1:56:29] <@Menitta> I didnt find them super compelling compared to P4. Thats just me
[1:56:33] <gustavozxd> @yaminoraiden it does!? I've never seen it and I thought it wasn't there, damn it
[1:56:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta i can get that
[1:56:46] <%jubejube56> You will never see Schneiders advertise weiners as "sandwich meat"
[1:56:47] <+itsjustdoogan> @haveswordmuststing good point, hadn't thought of the ham and cheese thought
[1:56:54] <+Story_Ark> so what we're getting at is that sub shops should sell hot dogs?
[1:57:02] <YaminoRaiden> you still need to trigger the flags with Junpei to get it.
[1:57:02] <Sokumotanaka> I'll be real p3 is my favorite but after 5 the gameplay was taxing
[1:57:03] <AThing_> @Menitta That's a fair reason
[1:57:05] <alephalpha> @dedlokpm give her a drill and make her box as well?
[1:57:06] <TheGreatestAutismo> P3's story also has the most depth compared to those after it
[1:57:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> i didn't enjoy any party member in p5 anywhere near as much as i enjoyed kanji being in my party in p4
[1:57:09] <gunzerkingdunce> @fireking900 also the Vincent "hitting" Rin was a translation issue, he just bats their hand away
[1:57:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> I WANT FIRST DIBS
[1:57:15] <gustavozxd> @menitta they get their moments way later in the game, I think it's worth it
[1:57:20] <%jubejube56> a submarine is a relative to a sandwich but not related to a hotdog in any waay
[1:57:27] <+Jaysky> From what I've heard from people is that P3 had the best story, 4 best cast, 5 best gameplay.
[1:57:28] <%DedlokPM> @alephalpha I mean she has some punch girl stuff, but ye
[1:57:37] <+Story_Ark> p3 just needs a remake tbh
[1:57:37] <fuji_92> SourPls
[1:57:37] <@Menitta> Like I said, I'll go back to P3 one day
[1:57:39] <gunzerkingdunce> This title song still a bop
[1:57:44] <OkieToki> SourPls
[1:57:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Even after playing p4g it was kind hard going back to p3 but I recently started playing nocturne and I'm starting to get used to the ps2 atlus quirks I think this is what Stockholm syndrome is like
[1:57:53] <alephalpha> p2remake when
[1:57:55] <%jubejube56> rip the tartarus magician crew
[1:58:04] <+Story_Ark> KORO
[1:58:04] <AThing_> Nocturne is so good, man, I hope they remake it soon.
[1:58:05] <+steak_bentley> god i hope arcsys announces something at evo
[1:58:11] <+Story_Ark> LET THE DOG PLAY
[1:58:13] <seylumiue> Nocturne deserves it
[1:58:14] <+doublexpwiikend> i think having whole dungeons for each party member is what really helped out characters compared to p5, i feel like that's also why yosuke isn't seen as a favorite besides for the removed romance option
[1:58:15] <+DarkNerdShawny> Line up!
[1:58:16] <%jubejube56> @steak_bentley probably a new grand blue char
[1:58:17] <gustavozxd> I tried going back to Megami tensei 1 and uh yeah it exists for sure
[1:58:19] <+DarkNerdShawny> Single file
[1:58:25] <Sokumotanaka> @Jaysky Whoever said p4 had the best cast told you a lie. P3's cast was the most human and everyone including the protag had their faults
[1:58:36] <TheGreatestAutismo> ^^^
[1:58:37] <fireking900> line up chat just like on max's stream
[1:58:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> LET'S GO
[1:58:47] <+steak_bentley> @jubejube56 daisuke announces hes in granblue
[1:58:48] <+DarkNerdShawny> Pat?
[1:58:49] <+Story_Ark> GET BENT
[1:58:49] <@Menitta> AW YEAH THIS MATCHUP
[1:58:49] <gunzerkingdunce> P3's cast were all orphans, I love them
[1:58:50] <gordieda20> YA WANT SOME
[1:58:51] <%Solidnick18> Kanji
[1:58:52] <+Jaysky> It wasn't an individual person, it was from many sources, and I'd agree with them.
[1:58:52] <YaminoRaiden> faults such as never wanting to talk to each other
[1:58:53] <+itsjustdoogan> These godless heathens on screen need to remove their hands from pockets while walking
[1:58:53] <gustavozxd> @sokumotanaka yes!
[1:58:55] <%Solidnick18> The problem
[1:58:55] <fireking900> PogChamp
[1:58:56] <fuji_92> Kanji time PogChamp
[1:58:56] <+steak_bentley> my boys
[1:58:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> unga chair man
[1:58:57] <seylumiue> Hell yea kanji
[1:58:58] <%jubejube56> @Sokumotanaka I don't want humans in my anime game tho?
[1:58:59] <%wujak> bad news, half the people who have been online have been playing kanji
[1:59:00] <+doublexpwiikend> @Sokumotanaka yeah but the group dynamic in p4 is so much better than p3
[1:59:01] <+Story_Ark> YA WANT SOME
[1:59:01] <gunzerkingdunce> Flying Eagle Kanji!
[1:59:04] <OkieToki> kanji PogChamp
[1:59:07] <fireking900> KANJI MY BOY
[1:59:09] <alephalpha> @sokumotanaka it's really weird that people say p4's cast is better
[1:59:10] <TheGreatestAutismo> P4's cast also fawns over MC too much
[1:59:15] <%Solidnick18> will they patch this Kappa
[1:59:17] <+steak_bentley> tell that to kanjikulb
[1:59:26] <gunzerkingdunce> Look at the CHUNK
[1:59:26] <%jubejube56> @steak_bentley I honestly want developers in fighting games. That would be so hype
[1:59:29] <TheGreatestAutismo> and that's compared to a game where the MC is a Jesus metaphor
[1:59:33] <%jubejube56> the smash Mii trailer promised soo much
[1:59:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> W A N T S O M E
[1:59:54] <fuji_92> KANJI BOYS UNITE PogChamp
[1:59:57] <%jubejube56> man the classic FNF persona sets
[2:00:02] <+steak_bentley> lol
[2:00:10] <wear_tear_rust> kbradIVORY moopokSadbiki
[2:00:16] <Man_in_the_Red> @jubejube56 Harada has a model in tekken, it can happen
[2:00:20] <Sokumotanaka> @Agentpigmcpig the p4 cast would not hang around with each other if yu wasn't a thing, they only chill cause they like him, yukiko and kanji never really even have a scene together, even the p3 cast everyone talked and had issues and so on
[2:00:23] <fireking900> That's All Annoying Talk Smack
[2:00:24] <+steak_bentley> i want harada in every fighting game
[2:00:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> those lunges into nothing EleGiggle
[2:00:30] <Sokumotanaka> but this is just my opinion
[2:00:38] <Astar_NoName> Anime has made me realize that I do not understand boxing.
[2:00:42] <%jubejube56> @haveswordmuststing I need harada with drop kicks, bear rolls, and capoera
[2:00:45] <fuji_92> big wifs
[2:00:49] <+steak_bentley> just punches innit
[2:00:50] <gunzerkingdunce> Kanji and Naoto, only real worthwhile characters
[2:00:50] <%DedlokPM> "Do you like JUMPER?" sbfpBlue
[2:01:01] <Sokumotanaka> @gunzerkingdunce Agreed
[2:01:04] <alephalpha> this is so weird after fighting a bunch of 1.5 bbtag akihiko
[2:01:05] <gustavozxd> p4 got a little too close to slice of life anime, p5 just is one
[2:01:19] <Man_in_the_Red> @jubejube56 he'd be shang tsung, but fun and tornament legal Kappa
[2:01:24] <AThing_> Naoto is pretty much what a female Raidou Kuzunoha probably would be.
[2:01:25] <fireking900> Kanji > Ryuji
[2:01:36] <+steak_bentley> is aki good in tag i've never played it
[2:01:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:01:37] <gunzerkingdunce> Least P5 had flair to the slice of life
[2:01:38] <fuji_92> CMON KANJI IK FOR US
[2:01:54] <+doublexpwiikend> @Sokumotanaka true tho the same could be said about SEES minus mitsuru and Akihiko, at least when it comes to handing out together
[2:01:54] <gunzerkingdunce> Brofist IK
[2:01:59] <alephalpha> Aki is top tier n the new bbtag patch
[2:02:07] <+steak_bentley> PogChamp
[2:02:18] <+doublexpwiikend> @Sokumotanaka the only diff being that fighting shadows brought them together instead of the the main character
[2:02:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> I HAD TO TRY
[2:02:23] <gordieda20> So close
[2:02:23] <@Menitta> OH YOU BITCH
[2:02:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK YOU
[2:02:23] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:02:25] <%jubejube56> I respect it Captain
[2:02:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> HE REALLY TRIED IT
[2:02:28] <+Story_Ark> LMAO THIS MAN
[2:02:32] <OkieToki> he went for it
[2:02:33] <TheGreatestAutismo> nah, Junpei and Yukari were friends before door-kun
[2:02:34] <%Solidnick18> Captain saget
[2:02:34] <+DarkNerdShawny> You tried it
[2:02:35] <OkieToki> i can respect that
[2:02:35] <+Jaysky> Walk up n win
[2:02:37] <fuji_92> DAMN PogChamp
[2:02:42] <fireking900> @CaptainPileDriver I respect it bro
[2:02:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK YOU IT'S 1-1 FROM THE LAST STREAM
[2:02:47] <Sokumotanaka> @Agentpigmcpig Not really everyone had their own reasons for being in sees, yukari wanted to find otu what happened to her dad, aki wanted power, same with ken
[2:02:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> THE HUEVOS
[2:02:49] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:02:50] <fuji_92> IK OR NO REPECT
[2:02:54] <+Jaysky> And Chie and Yukiko were friends before Yu showed up
[2:02:54] <%jubejube56> Woolie talking like this but Moopoke nailed him with that on his birthday
[2:02:57] <+DarkNerdShawny> Only people have human rights
[2:02:58] <%DedlokPM> Only people have human rights
[2:03:00] <%jubejube56> never forget
[2:03:00] <+Story_Ark> captain has more courage than anyone here
[2:03:04] <%Solidnick18> oh no
[2:03:05] <BonzoBeanMachine> nice p4 reference
[2:03:11] <AThing_> The best line to come out of P4
[2:03:15] <DonatelloJose> IF that would have landed, it would have killed the stream.
[2:03:23] <+itsjustdoogan> I sense theres a bit of salt going aroung
[2:03:26] <+itsjustdoogan> around
[2:03:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus night man, i'm going to a movie with my dad now, ggs
[2:03:34] <gustavozxd> Woolie you're a blanka player, you have no right to say anything
[2:03:43] <Man_in_the_Red> @donatellojose a strike so poweful it clears chat
[2:03:45] <Sokumotanaka> @Agentpigmcpig They werent there for the protag and even he had flaws, not all the girls were into him
[2:03:46] <YaminoRaiden> Poor Boop_Rose just wants to play but stumbled into a streamer lobby.
[2:03:48] <%jubejube56> Woolie confirmed not allowed to speak
[2:03:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> DO IT MENITTA
[2:03:58] <$RocketShot_> Only people have human rights.
[2:03:58] <+itsjustdoogan> @CaptainPileDriver gg night bud
[2:04:00] <+Story_Ark> everyones gotta try for an IK now, we need at least one on stream
[2:04:10] <fuji_92> IK OR NO RESPECT FOLKS
[2:04:11] <gunzerkingdunce> Ok so who is worse, Morgana or Teddie?
[2:04:14] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta stop being free
[2:04:18] <fireking900> Who ever gets the IK OWNS the stream, Woolie has to give them the stream key and everything
[2:04:18] <+Jaysky> Teddie.
[2:04:20] <%jubejube56> oh Morgana easy
[2:04:21] <Sokumotanaka> @gunzerkingdunce Teddie
[2:04:35] <%jubejube56> At least Teddie isn't some annoying Tamogotchi
[2:04:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> menitta, just go for the instant kill when you get a round in
[2:04:42] <TheGreatestAutismo> It's close, but deflated Teddie genuinely makes me chuckle
[2:04:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> what do you honestly have to lose
[2:04:49] <hamahiroyuki> mona's a drama queen but at least he aint a sex offender
[2:04:50] <+Story_Ark> if i was home id jump in with Teddie :)
[2:04:51] <Tekaii00> P4 is basically jojo part 4 if you think about it
[2:05:05] <OkieToki> morgana is worse, but it's pretty close
[2:05:07] <Sokumotanaka> Morgana at least taught you the theif trade he adds to conversations and genuinely cares for people. Teddie always talks about scoring to the point I wanted to behead him
[2:05:11] <+steak_bentley> it really is it's not even subtle
[2:05:13] <Astar_NoName> No. it is not.
[2:05:27] <gustavozxd> @hamahiroyuki he sure wants to tho LUL
[2:05:32] <fireking900> Menitta is gonna lose cause he dosent have a phase under his name SMH
[2:05:32] <+Jaysky> I enjoy puns but Teddie is unbearable at times
[2:05:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> I still say shit like "beary nice" to piss my friends off so Ted has my support for that alone
[2:05:48] <gunzerkingdunce> Gotta go Teddie, cuz he's next to useless

[2:33:32] <haitakaa> why does Akihiko have a knife
[2:33:32] <gunzerkingdunce> Kanji is such a chad in this game then you play his arcade mode and he's the exact opposite
[2:33:36] <%jubejube56> @TheGreatestAutismo Considering the fact that the best Melty Blood waifu is Rin Tohsaka and everybody knows it there will be no war
[2:33:44] <Sokumotanaka> Another + to jojo X persona Kanji and jotaro can meet up
[2:33:49] <+Jaysky> Well his chadding is all a front so
[2:33:49] <zenith0111> Hey guys VoHiYo

[2:34:10] <%jubejube56> @TheGreatestAutismo she is close enough related that all other waifus are obsolete
[2:34:13] <YaminoRaiden> Adachi
[2:34:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> his best weapon is like, a fucking super desk
[2:34:13] <TheGreatestAutismo> @jubejube56 Rin not even best girl in her own story
[2:34:18] <TheGreatestAutismo> M E D U S A
[2:34:19] <Sokumotanaka> @haitakaa They clarified that that wasn't ture XD
[2:34:25] <+stupidsquid> is this game still ps3?
[2:34:28] <gunzerkingdunce> Adachi!
[2:34:33] <+Vostroyan1> adachi all day
[2:34:35] <%jubejube56> Medusa doesn't even count until Heaven's Feel is adapted as a show
[2:34:35] <Phosphorescence_King> Kanji almost as gay as Shinji in Netflix EVA
[2:34:36] <AThing_> adachi
[2:34:41] <%jubejube56> Until then she might as well not exist
[2:34:42] <@Menitta> they are on PS3 @stupidsquid
[2:34:44] <fuji_92> adachi
[2:34:49] <gunzerkingdunce> Adachi, infinitely better than Akechi
[2:34:50] <+cheezy_snackz> Adachi
[2:34:54] <TheGreatestAutismo> @jubejube56 >show LUL
[2:34:59] <gustavozxd> @captainpiledriver there's a dynasty warriors character that had a table at some point, another one with a surf board
[2:35:00] <pumpyaarony> Hey guys!
[2:35:01] <+Story_Ark> PAIN IN THE ASS
[2:35:03] <PersonaUser64> Adach
[2:35:05] <@Menitta> I like Akechi tho...
[2:35:05] <fuji_92> BEST BOY ADACHI INC
[2:35:06] <+Jaysky> I get Adachi and Akechi's names mixed up often
[2:35:12] <%jubejube56> show-anime, you get the meaning
[2:35:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chadachi
[2:35:17] <gunzerkingdunce> Cuz least he owns up to his 3 murders, how many did Akechi kill again?
[2:35:20] <Tekaii00> I though Yusuke was gonna be gay when you first met him in p5
[2:35:21] <Sokumotanaka> @gunzerkingdunce I read that wrong I thought it said Adachi is better than thanos and I pictured him with a persona
[2:35:26] <pumpyaarony> VoHiYo
[2:35:31] <gunzerkingdunce> like dozens
[2:35:32] <@Menitta> Adachi has a Kiryu color in this game
[2:35:34] <TheGreatestAutismo> Nah, play the VN dude, FSN should be read
[2:35:37] <BonzoBeanMachine> look it's the badman
[2:35:45] <%mightyjoey2> wait he does?
[2:35:48] <gustavozxd> the good version of this battle theme nice
[2:35:49] <gunzerkingdunce> @sokumotanaka the Infinity Waifus
[2:35:50] <+Story_Ark> Reminder that Adachi's counter is just him tripping you and laughing
[2:35:56] <fireking900> Cold-Blooded Black Best Friend. Woolie?
[2:36:01] <@Menitta> @mightyjoey2 Yes. Grey suit, red shirt, black hair
[2:36:07] <%mightyjoey2> damn
[2:36:10] <%jubejube56> @TheGreatestAutismo oh I am well aware of the VN and the role she plays in Heavens Feel, just saying she won't be winning any wars until an anime adaptation
[2:36:14] <%mightyjoey2> I never knew that
[2:36:23] <@Menitta> Maybe its not explicitly Kiryu but its Kiryu cmon
[2:36:24] <Sokumotanaka> @gunzerkingdunce Akechi killed alot of people, what I don't like is that the party instantly forgives him and cause every tumblr idiot wants to fuck him wants to give him a redemption arc. (Give him a jail arc)
[2:36:32] <gunzerkingdunce> Seriously I hate Akechi and i hope we get to kill him ourselves in Royal
[2:36:32] <Tekaii00> LUL LUL
[2:36:54] <+VideoGameTim_> Akechi will for sure be playable
[2:36:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:36:54] <Sokumotanaka> We wont sadly hope he goes to ail though
[2:36:55] <GenericSoda> Ultimax?!
[2:36:57] <zenith0111> Oh Royal NotLikeThis
[2:36:58] <gustavozxd> akechi's pancakes fiasco got to me instantly
[2:36:59] <+TruSanKyuu> Wait why is Adachi playable? Kappa
[2:37:00] <+Noahccountingfortaste> @Sokumotanaka it IS unfortunate that he's forgiven rather quickly; his ending arc is too rushed
[2:37:05] <fireking900> why is Rise cheering Adachi on LUL
[2:37:11] <@Menitta> I like Akechi tho.... woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:37:12] <TheGreatestAutismo> @jubejube56 winning anime wars doesn't matter when uncultured masses are voting
[2:37:14] <AThing_> Rise's a wild card
[2:37:20] <gunzerkingdunce> @sokumotanaka yuuuuuuup, uwu baby akechi did nothing wrong
[2:37:21] <+VideoGameTim_> read the doujin
[2:37:23] <TheGreatestAutismo> That said
[2:37:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> A check is a check
[2:37:25] <Sokumotanaka> @fireking900 Traitor's requem
[2:37:25] <%hatesdps> akechi wasnt that bad, but i guess adachi put the bar pretty low for scumbags
[2:37:36] <+Noahccountingfortaste> @fireking900 with Yukiko gone, one less person to compete for Kenpachi Ramasama's affections
[2:37:39] <gustavozxd> akechi's voiced by my fav ffxv boy though so y'know what
[2:37:40] <%jubejube56> anime again teaching life lessons
[2:37:46] <TheGreatestAutismo> I better see some Aoko Aozaki in the melty stream
[2:37:54] <GenericSoda> just pick top tier narukami
[2:37:58] <TheGreatestAutismo> tfw Touko will never be in a fighting game
[2:38:08] <fuji_92> IK TIME
[2:38:16] <Sokumotanaka> @Noahccountingfortaste You're super right that's why I'm hoping royal fixes it and again regardless if he turns a new leaf he still kills people and needs to go to jail
[2:38:17] <gustavozxd> @thegreatestautismo Marie Rose is the most popular DOA girl so ok yeah
[2:38:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> INSTANT KILL WHEN SOMEONE HAS 100 METER
[2:38:25] <TheGreatestAutismo> ^^^
[2:38:28] <Phosphorescence_King> I need to see the Adachi short hop loop combos.

[2:38:56] <Prism_Wing> cmonBruh
[2:38:56] <+Jaysky> I didn't like how they played out Akechi at the end. It felt incredibly avoidable.
[2:39:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> nice
[2:39:03] <+Noahccountingfortaste> @Sokumotanaka they could pull something akin to Adachi, where you just get the odd message from him from his cell, maybe even interact with him a bit after THAT happens on Christmas
[2:39:08] <ManEaterPug> GG GUYS
[2:39:10] <fuji_92> good fight
[2:39:11] <+cheezy_snackz> Don’t shoot him he’s not black

[2:39:32] <BonzoBeanMachine> that man is not black

[2:40:01] <+Jaysky> A translator made that decision
[2:40:01] <gunzerkingdunce> Least Akechi's Loki design was the shit
[2:40:05] <gustavozxd> it's such a good(awful) line LUL
[2:40:15] <@Menitta> Oh this match is disgusting
[2:40:17] <YaminoRaiden> or juzt say "black hearted"

[2:40:40] <@Menitta> that color is better
[2:40:44] <hamahiroyuki> goku in db xenoverse: "so, you're black huh"
[2:40:44] <+cheezy_snackz> Dark Goku sounds pretty stupid though
[2:40:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> the sound is so bad
[2:40:46] <gustavozxd> literally Woolie
[2:40:48] <+Jaysky> But seriously, the whole cognition Akechi took so long to do stuff Akechi could have gotten out of that situation easily. The group could have helped too.
[2:40:49] <+TruSanKyuu> NotLikeThis
[2:40:52] <Sokumotanaka> "I'll steal IT no one will ever know!" Ryuji sakamoto
[2:40:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> on block the sound
[2:40:56] <%Wool> Laggy Yukiko mirrors lets go
[2:40:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's like a computer error
[2:40:58] <spardanwarrior> They translated it for Kid Icarus and Metroid at least.
[2:41:01] <fireking900> The Dumpster Queen Mirror Match
[2:41:03] <%sporeian94> Persona 5 Arena when?
[2:41:07] <Scales_Tipper> not really a "fan" of this mirror match
[2:41:09] <zenith0111> Just like intended SeemsGood
[2:41:10] <%jubejube56> The two yukikos are single handledly destroying all the P4AU servers
[2:41:24] <gustavozxd> @sporeian94 I've been asking that since before p5 came out NotLikeThis
[2:41:25] <DrivenDust> Another good example is the recent NGE one:" I really like Shinji." OMEGALUL
[2:41:26] <fireking900> Fighting for the queen of the landfill
[2:41:30] <isolex_> @WoolieVersus The number is in the lobby when you're both sitting.
[2:41:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> god that sound on block is so bad
[2:41:37] <%sporeian94> I just want Makoto's finisher to be sitting on the enemy's face to death
[2:41:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Fujiwara_92
[2:42:00] <Sokumotanaka> @sporeian94 God I wish that was me
[2:42:03] <gunzerkingdunce> They tried doing the "he's just like you" thing with Akechi like they did with Adachi, but it still doesn't work CUZ WE'RE AREN'T MURDERERS
[2:42:04] <%jubejube56> @sporeian94 I think they will try to avoid feeding fetishes where possible
[2:42:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> we haven't seen a jubei tonight
[2:42:17] <+Jaysky> Makoto's IK could be something akin to Captain Falcon's final smash
[2:42:18] <GenericSoda> @captainpiledriver it was worse in the arcade version, they changed it for console
[2:42:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> we need to see the worst character in this game
[2:42:21] <+Noahccountingfortaste> @jubejube56 ironically LITERALLY impossible
[2:42:26] <%Irridium> @jubejube56 They can try. They will fail.
[2:42:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh god.
[2:42:29] <gustavozxd> @gunzerkingdunce also kinda lazy to do the same thing again
[2:42:30] <Sokumotanaka> @gunzerkingdunce "You and I aren't so different you know?"
[2:42:46] <TheGreatestAutismo> @jubejube56 nah, they embrace them, Mitsu became a goddamn dominatrix in this game
[2:42:50] <Tekaii00> Akechi buff shadow father would be od in P5 arena
[2:42:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> INSTANT KILL CHANT
[2:43:00] <gunzerkingdunce> "You ate a giant burger, I murdered babies, we're the same!"
[2:43:17] <%jubejube56> Well....just don't make it too obvious in the future
[2:43:17] <PersonaUser64> Air throws aren't scaled in arcsys games I think
[2:43:19] <gustavozxd> although I do like akechi's "don't give me that cliche bullshit" line
[2:43:21] <spardanwarrior> Remember how the guys who dubbed Hellsing had to yell at the creator that its Alucard and not Arucardo?
[2:43:36] <fireking900> I hope we see a Noato before tonight is over
[2:43:36] <zenith0111> Gutsu
[2:43:39] <hamahiroyuki> btw, did the p4 crew acidentely killed the mitsuo?
[2:43:44] <gunzerkingdunce> He's always the CrimsonFuckr to me
[2:43:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> "We're not so different, you and I." - Ted Bundy
[2:43:50] <TheGreatestAutismo> the chad Adachi vs the virgin Akechi
[2:44:12] <Sokumotanaka> @gustavozxd But akechi did the "we could of been in different places" line too
[2:44:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:44:14] <haitakaa> I mean Adachi is probably a virgin
[2:44:19] <gustavozxd> oh man I wish Hitler said "we're not so different you and I" in p2 LUL
[2:44:30] <gustavozxd> imagine having Hitler say that
[2:44:34] <Sokumotanaka> @gustavozxd To maya
[2:44:35] <zenith0111> Anime characters live in perpetual virginity
[2:44:38] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis
[2:44:38] <%jubejube56> @haitakaa Adachi is definitely not a virgin
[2:44:41] <TheGreatestAutismo> Adachi sacrificed getting laid to remove the world of bitches though
[2:44:45] <Tekaii00> Adachi probably started P4 because He's a virgin
[2:44:47] <isolex_> @zenith0111 just like me
[2:44:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> i have a good connection
[2:44:55] <gunzerkingdunce> @sokumotanaka that line doesn't work when you KILL people
[2:45:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> @thegreatestautismo then hes the hero of p4
[2:45:01] <Sokumotanaka> TFW goku isn't a virgin but dante is
[2:45:01] <fireking900> Kiryu dosent know what sex is
[2:45:07] <isolex_> @WoolieVersus It's a number
[2:45:12] <gustavozxd> @sokumotanaka her driving skills are basically the Holocaust
[2:45:19] <isolex_> Woolie channeling paige LUL
[2:45:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's that square next to the name when they sit down
[2:45:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> Dante owns that "I have never seen a vagina" t-shirt
[2:45:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> MORE KANJI
[2:45:35] <gunzerkingdunce> @fireking900 Yagami does and he can get a harem
[2:45:38] <+Noahccountingfortaste> G E T B E N T
[2:45:39] <%Irridium> Broke: Dante doesn't know what Sex is. Woke: Dante doesn't know how to read.
[2:45:41] <%jubejube56> @Sokumotanaka I think dante's flirting with the DMC3 vampire is more sexual tension than Goku had his whole life
[2:45:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> GET BENT
[2:45:46] <fireking900> Goku dosent either AND HES A FATHER
[2:45:48] <+Jaysky> I bet Dante has seen vagina, only by accident though
[2:45:50] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Fujiwara_92
[2:45:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> you gonna eat some chair
[2:46:00] <%wujak> you can hit square in the menu to see the list of everyone and their connection strength if you want to just tell people to leave the room, but otherwise they have to sit down
[2:46:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> what wujak said
[2:46:22] <gunzerkingdunce> Actual Virgin Kiryu vs Chadgami
[2:46:24] <%mightyjoey2> Kanji is the worst character in P4AU
[2:46:25] <GenericSoda> no you need to duck the air tackle
[2:46:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> Purple Kanji PowerUpL EleGiggle PowerUpR
[2:46:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> @mightyjoey2 is he? what about jubei
[2:46:40] <GenericSoda> @woolieversus lgotta duck air tackle
[2:46:41] <seylumiue> This is yakuza kanji
[2:46:42] <fireking900> That is a nice Kanji color
[2:46:43] <haitakaa> I doubt Adachi has ever had a girlfriend
[2:46:44] <Sokumotanaka> @jubejube56 You're right but goku has reproduced and is dumb and never kissed his wife while dante a guy who honestly should of smashed alot of puss is virgin

[2:49:23] <gunzerkingdunce> Where's gotta go fast boy?
[2:49:24] <%jubejube56> Kanji is probably not the best grappler mechanically but easily one of the most hype
[2:49:25] <gustavozxd> grapplers are scary

[3:28:17] <Deviant_Mugen> No flag tattoos visible, though. Geiger needs to step his game up.
[3:28:25] <Mendin> Geiger just did the Dio from the End of 'ZA WARUDO' OP
[3:28:32] <nopethebard> Yup
[3:28:41] <Sokumotanaka> @Mendin HE literally did XD
[3:28:54] <%SirGO0SE> just like in samsho you can know a match is over after a button press
[3:29:09] <nopethebard> More like ST
[3:29:22] <%SirGO0SE> air super walk in is my geiger jam
[3:29:38] <fireking900> OOF
[3:29:38] <gunzerkingdunce> I come back to this, what is this?
[3:29:41] <Mendin> That Swag
[3:29:41] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:29:53] <%jubejube56> rainbow? rainbow
[3:29:57] <gunzerkingdunce> Looks marvel like
[3:29:58] <%SirGO0SE> @gunzerkingdunce pure ass fighting game
[3:30:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> RainBOW!
[3:30:11] <+G_R_A_G> it's an honest footsies game that is secretly full of incredibly sleazy nonsen
[3:30:12] <%SirGO0SE> use air super on Geiger, walk in
[3:30:14] <+G_R_A_G> er, nonsense
[3:30:15] <zenith0111> Moves with audio clips NotLikeThis
[3:30:20] <Sokumotanaka> XDDDDD
[3:30:31] <+G_R_A_G> one character has a counter-hit combo that does 50–80% damage, depending on character
[3:30:32] <Sokumotanaka> Played yoself
[3:30:32] <%SirGO0SE> the nonsense is this game is like, 90% rook
[3:30:35] <357Sneak> @gunzerkingdunce this is is Fantasy Strike
[3:30:51] <Mendin> GRAG: Setsuki off jumping shank?
[3:30:51] <gunzerkingdunce> hm, neat
[3:30:54] <%SirGO0SE> because he can put you in a 50/50 and have oki after everywin
[3:31:11] <nopethebard> He’s still low tier
[3:31:23] <%SirGO0SE> is he?
[3:31:28] <nopethebard> Yes
[3:31:29] <%SirGO0SE> dang just a personal wall then
[3:31:37] <%SirGO0SE> i cant deal with top rooks
[3:31:47] <nopethebard> He crushes new players very hard
[3:32:03] <sunnythedrunk> Most Grapplers are like that
[3:32:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hubris
[3:32:13] <nopethebard> Right
[3:32:14] <%SirGO0SE> yeah the mixup after he hits the grab between the drop kick or another grab is really hard for me to deal with
[3:32:15] <%jmstwn> jmstwn subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:32:18] <Mendin> Valerie is doing the Kakyoin from SC episode 2
[3:32:31] <sunnythedrunk> Valeria is Millia Rage basically
[3:32:36] <division_ring> Woolie representing the tier list with this Geiger play.
[3:32:53] <+G_R_A_G> Valerie is like Fei Long and Milia Rage had a kid
[3:33:05] <SkimLives> Woolie forgot the low tier hole he lives in because Geiger was strong last time he played...
[3:33:06] <nopethebard> Who paints
[3:33:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> 0 Wins FeelsBadMan
[3:33:15] <nopethebard> Still is
[3:33:16] <+G_R_A_G> the non-martial arts are important too
[3:33:19] <Mendin> Time.exe Downloaded
[3:34:09] <sunnythedrunk> Tell Reggie to try her air super on Oki
[3:34:11] <+flarebears> I LOVE YOU WOOLZ
[3:34:40] <ManOfReason> if geiger wasnt such a cocky bastard he would be the strongest character in this game
[3:34:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:34:45] <Mendin> Whoever's Geigering needs to try the mindfuck of Delayed Time Spiral, walk up with it, Za Warudo before the block
[3:35:02] <%SirGO0SE> geiger airsuper IS GOD
[3:35:11] <Frolomeo> The fuck is Ron funches doing chilling with woolie?
[3:35:16] <%SirGO0SE> geiger air super = your turn
[3:35:56] <%SirGO0SE> gotta give some room, leave it room to claim some space
[3:36:47] <Mendin> is Woolie Geiger or Val?
[3:36:56] <fireking900> just look 4head

[3:38:02] <fuji_92> nice
[3:38:07] <@Menitta> it seems like a fantastic game to really teach neutral game which I desperately need
[3:38:13] <%SirGO0SE> this is a G R E A T game. been following it since it popped up on the Unity spotlight for devs like 2 yrs ago
[3:38:14] <+thesw1tch> see look how effective woolien be when he doesn't do rainbow over and over
[3:38:15] <nopethebard> Very

[3:38:28] <%SirGO0SE> its an A-M-A-Z-I-N-G getting into fighting games game
[3:38:39] <%jubejube56> rainbow dis!
[3:38:40] <%SirGO0SE> you will leave the game understanding all fundamentals
[3:38:59] <sunnythedrunk> This is easily the best fighting game on the market for it's price and it's super easy to get into
[3:39:03] <Triplicat> and unable to high/low block 4Head
[3:39:24] <nopethebard> Who needs high/low?
[3:40:08] <fireking900> Fantasy Strike AE adds a crouch button

[3:42:03] <fuji_92> I AM A PERFECT SOLDIER DatSheffy
[3:42:15] <Mendin> That really long step-kick seems the best punish for Geiger to use out of his walk-a-bout when you're ranged out
[3:42:24] <shobbs001> that cross
[3:42:28] <shobbs001> for days
[3:42:29] <%SirGO0SE> @WoolieVersus if he gives you room, crack the air super on Geiger and make him hold it
[3:43:03] <fuji_92> DatSheffy

[3:51:01] <%SirGO0SE> P I E THEIF
[3:51:26] <Tekaii00> throwing the dark skinned girl melons WOWW
[3:51:26] <%SirGO0SE> Lums worst matchup is probably who, Midori? since you just feed him dragon
[3:51:34] <nopethebard> Setsuki
[3:51:40] <+Hypergr4v> Val
[3:51:49] <division_ring> Somebody mentioned earlier, but I realized - Thelo still hasn't explained what the red/blue hit sparks are.
[3:51:49] <%SirGO0SE> interesting
[3:51:49] <MainManJonadiah> So many panda-babies
[3:51:51] <%SirGO0SE> YA BABIES ROLL
[3:51:54] <%SirGO0SE> DEAL WITH THEM

[3:52:16] <zenith0111> GO*
[3:52:23] <+Hypergr4v> Super in response to melon wins there
[3:52:27] <Mendin> Detection Averted
[3:52:38] <fuji_92> Soul get
[3:52:47] <Mendin> But yeah that slot machine is technically a hitbox for a bad anti-air in addition to its rollout of random stuff
[3:52:53] <%Toynota10> Toynota10 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Have you ever had a matchup you straight up found unfun? Like, characters that lock you in with some bullshit you can't get out of? You have any advice on dealing with their absurdity?
[3:52:58] <fuji_92> damn
[3:52:59] <fireking900> oh, my, goodness
[3:53:16] <nopethebard> Play the other side and see how they kill you

[3:53:55] <Mendin> no hes actually haunted
[3:53:57] <division_ring> Ghost Choker!
[3:53:58] <MainManJonadiah> Or a stand wife
[3:54:03] <someyounguy1> not only does he have a stand he also has dandy steps
[3:54:05] <Iceboi_Patti> Ithe stand has a dude more like
[3:54:07] <fireking900> ghost wife stand
[3:54:56] <Mendin> Good spacing,
[3:54:57] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:55:01] <someyounguy1> counter that drop in. its such a good super counter
[3:55:29] <MainManJonadiah> That's such a simple super, but I love it so much
[3:55:35] <+Lord0Mugen> HEY! Its Ultra Super Hyper Street Fighter II: The New Final Warriors.
[3:55:51] <fuji_92> ded
[3:55:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:55:55] <someyounguy1> use the air super as geiger
[3:56:04] <zenith0111> WHAT
[3:56:12] <Mendin> LEAN BACK SON
[3:56:17] <zenith0111> PILEBUNKER
[3:56:31] <nopethebard> Beware his frame traps
[3:56:34] <+Lord0Mugen> Rook main here!
[3:56:37] <Mendin> Justice Kick? Dojyaa~n
[3:56:55] <+Lord0Mugen> I still hate the dragon man.
[3:57:03] <+Lord0Mugen> so broken
[3:57:10] <nopethebard> Flee the dragon
[3:57:21] <+Lord0Mugen> he soooo good!
[3:57:28] <someyounguy1> use another air super
[3:57:29] <Zeif00> huh
[3:57:30] <nopethebard> Run and stall it out
[3:57:34] <division_ring> Awww, missed the double clockwork. :(
[3:57:35] <+Lord0Mugen> i know!
[3:57:40] <+Lord0Mugen> still hate it
[3:57:41] <zenith0111> That jump in
[3:57:42] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @shobbs001
[3:57:55] <+Lord0Mugen> I DO however like their Dhalsim guy
[3:57:59] <+Lord0Mugen> Argagarg
[3:58:09] <fuji_92> I AM A PERFECT SOLDIER DatSheffy
[3:58:17] <sunnythedrunk> A good argagarg is rare
[3:58:24] <Mendin> Now I see why DeGrey is in the wildcard slot. Feints, parries, and stuns out of nowhere everywhere
[3:58:33] <nopethebard> Yup
[3:58:35] <someyounguy1> can you not yomi counter the grab after geiger super?
[3:58:42] <+Lord0Mugen> @sunnythedrunk good. because the good ones would probably make people rage quit
[3:58:53] <shobbs001> no he has 10 frame recover
[3:58:56] <+Lord0Mugen> like the good Lums
[3:59:00] <sunnythedrunk> @supaXmugen true
[3:59:03] <+Hypergr4v> Can’t yomi counter during recovery
[3:59:04] <MainManJonadiah> Let's go, grapplers!
[3:59:24] <Mendin> rook's air super is jst gief's headbutt
[3:59:40] <fireking900> what is blue? Armor?
[3:59:45] <nopethebard> Yes
[3:59:47] <danielstretulch> Blue is armor
[3:59:47] <shobbs001> amor
[4:00:04] <MainManJonadiah> OOH!
[4:00:23] <+Hypergr4v> Dat Screen shake
[4:00:36] <Mendin> Real Ural Mountains Damage, comrade
[4:00:41] <BwdYeti> draw? it counts actual pips, not percent? interesting
[4:00:46] <MainManJonadiah> Windmill crusher is a pretty good name for a command grab
[4:00:53] <nopethebard> Ikr
[4:00:58] <antthefool> Whaddup whaddup
[4:01:18] <+Lord0Mugen> Im glad the made clap usable
[4:01:29] <+Lord0Mugen> for the longest time he would auto lose to zoners
[4:01:29] <+Hypergr4v> Lotta vines
[4:01:43] <Mendin> Gief gotta have that green hand, yeah
[4:01:52] <+Lord0Mugen> now Rook loses to just good players
[4:02:03] <nopethebard> Vines the main answer to fireballs
[4:02:21] <+Lord0Mugen> @Mendin yeah cause he would have to jump in and thats just THE WORST for a grappler.
[4:02:47] <+Lord0Mugen> @nopethebard not really. unless Sirlin changed the frames on the landing.
[4:03:09] <Mendin> Ultimate Uranium-Mine Buster
[4:03:10] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:03:11] <MainManJonadiah> YEYEYEYE
[4:03:15] <sunnythedrunk> You should always do the armored move after Earthquake to get close
[4:03:20] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[4:03:25] <+Lord0Mugen> landing frames were so slow you would get punished for using vines up close
[4:03:26] <someyounguy1> that was rad as heck
[4:03:28] <fireking900> ok this game is sick
[4:03:36] <Mendin> Anyone remember the Headbut Trollgief Polka videos?
[4:03:37] <+Hypergr4v> Give him the boot
[4:03:42] <Mendin> I just heard that music as that counter-super went down
[4:04:23] <+Lord0Mugen> EVERYONE who doesnt have this game and loves fighter SHOULD buy this. im justing saying
[4:04:29] <sunnythedrunk> ^
[4:04:30] <+Lord0Mugen> *fighters
[4:04:32] <nopethebard> Agreed
[4:05:20] <+Lord0Mugen> Like THIS, Sam Sho, and Killer Instinct are probably the best 2D fighters this gen.
[4:05:23] <MainManJonadiah> I run a mini-fgc at my college, and this is definitely being brought in now.
[4:05:47] <MainManJonadiah> Also: "Checkmate Buster," I'm in love with this grappler.
[4:06:06] <+Lord0Mugen> Dude Rook is like the best Grabbler thats ever grabbler'd
[4:06:11] <nopethebard> Chess puns all around
[4:06:17] <fuji_92> LUL
[4:06:19] <division_ring> All this time with the grappler... I don't think Woolie has used out a normal throw.
[4:06:24] <+Lord0Mugen> since he actually DOES what hes supposed to do
[4:06:33] <nopethebard> It’s also good
[4:06:34] <MainManJonadiah> I didn't even put the chess thing together until you said that, haha.
[4:06:42] <Mendin> Cerebella was pretty robust for her grapply stuff too, wasn't she?
[4:06:47] <+Lord0Mugen> yeah, thats a problem too. Normal throws in this game are like THE BEST
[4:06:55] <nopethebard> Windmill is a type chess tactic as well
[4:07:27] <MainManJonadiah> I had no idea, the more you know
[4:07:35] <+Lord0Mugen> @Mendin she was alright. but the game is MVC though. Unless theres a "Metal Cerabella" super, its hard to do anything.
[4:07:36] <someyounguy1> why do the characters eyes sparkle sometimes
[4:07:46] <MainManJonadiah> I think they sparkle when they get super
[4:07:47] <fireking900> Cause Anime
[4:07:48] <shobbs001> means there meter is full
[4:08:02] <shobbs001> do u don't have to look down at it
[4:08:02] <Mendin> They;re crackling with energy

[4:10:12] <shobbs001> fantasy strike
[4:10:12] <nopethebard> Fantasy Strike
[4:10:25] <+EndgameContent> He totally teched that throw!
[4:10:32] <RenFuuma> never heard of it, looks interesting though
[4:10:39] <nopethebard> It’s awesome
[4:11:03] <shobbs001> yea comes out the 25 on ps4 and switch / in beta on stream right now
[4:11:09] <shobbs001> steam
[4:11:37] <fireking900> Woolie still salty about Val LUL
[4:11:47] <division_ring> It's also cheap right now - isn't it going to 39.99 or something on release?
[4:11:48] <+Lord0Mugen> what about Valerie?
[4:12:05] <nopethebard> $30
[4:12:19] <MainManJonadiah> So what you're saying is buying it RIGHT now is the best choice
[4:12:19] <division_ring> Ok, so it'll *still* be cheap afterwards. :D
[4:12:23] <%akira_chong> Is it available for pre-order on PS4?
[4:12:24] <+Lord0Mugen> definitely worth $30
[4:12:39] <RenFuuma> ooo, I see.
[4:12:55] <+Lord0Mugen> is it still cross platform with Switch, PC, PS4?
[4:13:01] <shobbs001> its 15 right now and runs on most potatoes
[4:13:12] <division_ring> Steam can crossplay with either, but the console crossplay is blocked by Sony.
[4:13:19] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[4:13:22] <+TopTieramisu> too galaxy brained
[4:13:23] <Ion_Laser> :D
[4:13:25] <%akira_chong> @RenFuuma Think a streamlined Super Turbo where every move is one button and there are like no combos. It's designed so newbies can learn all the moves and get into just worrying about decision making after a couple of hours of play, max.
[4:13:28] <RenFuuma> how many fighters are there?
[4:13:29] <%akira_chong> It's really neat.
[4:13:30] <BwdYeti> woolie trying to hit people out of i-frames
[4:13:35] <%akira_chong> Ten fighters
[4:13:37] <sunnythedrunk> This is also the perfect game to play with friends who don't play your fighting games
[4:13:38] <shobbs001> pc as cross play with both and ps4 and switch with pc only
[4:14:01] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[4:14:04] <shobbs001> also it great for different fight to play each other
[4:14:11] <RenFuuma> no combos in a fighting game?? that is rare now a days.
[4:14:19] <fuji_92> I frames
[4:14:20] <%akira_chong> I know, right?
[4:14:22] <nopethebard> Short combos
[4:14:24] <fireking900> Woolie you can clap the fireballs
[4:14:27] <+TopTieramisu> samsho tho
[4:14:32] <%akira_chong> Okay short combos
[4:14:39] <MainManJonadiah> I already like Argagarg
[4:14:40] <%akira_chong> Like two hits?
[4:14:51] <nopethebard> 2-3
[4:14:56] <shobbs001> yea there are some big combos
[4:15:08] <nopethebard> But mostly 2-3
[4:15:10] <shobbs001> 3 is normal tho
[4:15:19] <BwdYeti> a r g a g a r g
[4:15:21] <MainManJonadiah> FANG in a game with pips? That's already crazy
[4:15:22] <+TopTieramisu> sim
[4:15:24] <shobbs001> I have land a 11 hit 7 damage combo with val
[4:15:27] <shobbs001> landed
[4:15:29] <Mendin> Meet the murloc that;s Fang-Sim
[4:15:31] <Ion_Laser> Wow
[4:15:49] <Mendin> ie: Poison and the keepaway suite to actually make it stick
[4:15:50] <fireking900> We WOW now BOIS
[4:15:51] <division_ring> Arg in the house. Get ready to be demoralized.
[4:15:56] <BwdYeti> 'like fang but good' LUL
[4:15:56] <+Lord0Mugen> POISON THAT WORKS!
[4:15:58] <%akira_chong> Oh, right, Argagarg is Dhalsim.
[4:15:59] <MainManJonadiah> "Like FANG, but good." I like that.
[4:16:09] <+Lord0Mugen> If only Crapcom would allow it!
[4:16:15] <fireking900> yo that throw puts you so far
[4:16:29] <nopethebard> He needs it to
[4:16:30] <shobbs001> there are touch of death combos in this but the planets have to line up to land them
[4:16:39] <+TopTieramisu> damn
[4:16:42] <Mendin> yoooo
[4:16:58] <+Lord0Mugen> only ToDs are like with the ninja bitch
[4:17:06] <RenFuuma> doesn't seem rush down heavy or footsy based
[4:17:10] <Mendin> Ok yeah Arg fights pretty much exactly the same as he plays in Yomi'
[4:17:16] <+TopTieramisu> that's some lockdown right there
[4:17:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:17:23] <fireking900> wait the wave just pushes back? this guy is so intresting
[4:17:44] <shobbs001> @RenFuuma it is very footies like hard
[4:17:47] <+TopTieramisu> this is like a guile sim with poison
[4:18:03] <+Lord0Mugen> @fireking900 the wave doesnt do anything except push back unless you press it again i think
[4:18:07] <RenFuuma> cant tell much from this match up
[4:18:09] <MainManJonadiah> Except the Sonic booms don't do damage, they just have knockback
[4:18:15] <+Lord0Mugen> then a fish jumps out of it
[4:18:18] <%akira_chong> This reminds me: I hate the fact that ST's arcade mode is so freaking impossibly hard
[4:18:23] <RenFuuma> the green dude has super reach and the archer archers
[4:18:26] <+TopTieramisu> it's still leads to a lot of lockdown pressure in the corner
[4:18:31] <fireking900> WTF WAS THAT
[4:18:32] <Mendin> Arg is being played by one of the game devs so he's kinda clowning on em while this goes on
[4:18:47] <BlackOrchidKI> SHINRYUKEN
[4:18:48] <MainManJonadiah> Oh, he's a dev? I didn't know that, cool.
[4:18:55] <shobbs001> he is 1 of the top arg player also
[4:19:06] <MainManJonadiah> Ahh, so this just isn't even fair, haha.
[4:19:13] <+TopTieramisu> even the sim float
[4:19:14] <RenFuuma> heh
[4:19:20] <nopethebard> Yup
[4:19:32] <fireking900> Yo Arg is nuts
[4:19:45] <Mendin> I mean Arg is pretty technical with his whole keepaway-poison schtick so having One Of The Best put on an exhibition of it is a good introduction of the skill ceiling
[4:19:52] <division_ring> Needs more big fish.
[4:19:54] <fireking900> im loving his game plan and everything
[4:20:17] <+Lord0Mugen> Wheres Nicky?
[4:20:23] <MainManJonadiah> Yeah, you can tell just by looking that Arg is good... But real hard.
[4:20:30] <fireking900> and the poison moves to the next pip that nuts
[4:20:34] <+Lord0Mugen> That boy gives this game the succ all day long
[4:20:43] <%akira_chong> I'm really looking forward to the full release of this.
[4:20:44] <Mendin> HP damage doesn't drain poison damage, that owns
[4:20:53] <sunnythedrunk> If you guys wanna see more SBFP played this a while ago and Weekend Warriors has a nice little learning series on it
[4:20:54] <+Lord0Mugen> Woolie playing online?
[4:21:07] <fireking900> They played everyone but Adult Pat
[4:21:27] <BlackOrchidKI> Colonel Sanders?
[4:21:44] <nopethebard> Midori is basically E Honda with a parry and can turn into a dragon
[4:21:46] <%akira_chong> Yeah, SBFP played it before everyone was even added in, though.
[4:22:00] <+TopTieramisu> rainbow ibuki
[4:22:08] <MainManJonadiah> Yeah Argagarg and the Panda weren't in the Friday Night Fisticuffs
[4:22:36] <scrumbotime> I played some Yomi with some pals earlier so its good to see more about this
[4:22:40] <+TopTieramisu> za warudo
[4:23:12] <Mendin> The eventual (hopefully) expansion of this game will add: Explosion Anarchist M Bison, A Demon Succubus, Big Armor Samurai Man, A Robit, That Assassin Zombie from Last Blade 2, a Healer, A Plague Lady, and Mayor Urien The Aegis Reflector
[4:23:24] <Mendin> *and a buffalo man, and Akuma But A Dragon
[4:23:41] <+Hypergr4v> A plague lady
[4:24:18] <Mendin> I dont know a good reductive descriptor of the healer and plague ladies I never used them much
[4:24:18] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:24:19] <nopethebard> She’s super scary rushdown but is slowly dying throughout the game
[4:24:28] <Mendin> Oh she;'s Dark Phoenix
[4:24:30] <fireking900> I love that there is some much utility in this game, not many fighting games give you moves or supers that dont do dmg but do someone super useful
[4:24:38] <%akira_chong> Oh so there ARE more characters planned?
[4:24:40] <BlackOrchidKI> Mayor Urien is intriguing
[4:24:43] <fireking900> * so much
[4:24:49] <nopethebard> If the game does well enough
[4:24:52] <shobbs001> 10 more if game sells good
[4:24:57] <%akira_chong> Yeah boi
[4:25:01] <Mendin> The Fantasy Strike universe was originally expressed in a few tabletop games, and those games have the other 10 characters as expansions
[4:25:09] <Flarepulse> was this that game that had the Overwatch-esque dev updates
[4:25:10] <%akira_chong> Oh yeah!
[4:25:28] <nopethebard> Yes
[4:25:39] <scrumbotime> Yomi is sick as hell
[4:26:03] <nopethebard> Yomi rules
[4:26:36] <@Menitta> yomi is on sale on steam btw. Its $7 iirc
[4:26:47] <@Menitta> So is fantasy strike
[4:26:58] <%akira_chong> I feel like I should get one of the physical decks.
[4:27:02] <Mendin> "Mayor Urien" probably is a bad descriptor of him but in the tabletop games, he uses Justice and Mirror Magic Fuckery to set up eternal 50/50 and 33/33/33 option choices that are always good for him and shitty for others
[4:27:02] <+Hypergr4v> Lol
[4:27:11] <Mendin> He is a gigantic pain in t he ass to play against and I love him
[4:27:19] <@Menitta> I might grab Yomi right now
[4:27:23] <nopethebard> He’s kinda like Zato but fair
[4:27:42] <Mendin> Yeah if you stuff his momentum it breaks his chain of bullshit
[4:27:48] <Mendin> and he has to get up and running again
[4:28:19] <SirlinGames> rushdown characters have less health
[4:28:33] <fireking900> Do them pushups LUL
[4:28:35] <SirlinGames> Rook has 8, Midori 7, most characters 6, Setsuki/Valerie 5
[4:28:40] <Mendin> Rushdown characters have 5hp, average characters have 6 hp, the two grapplers have 7/8 hp
[4:28:48] <nopethebard> Quince is probably Yomi’s hardest character to learn
[4:29:01] <nopethebard> Except maybe Gloria
[4:29:32] <Mendin> He's a fantastic troll though once you know what you're doing
[4:29:51] <Mendin> I -think- Zane is also a troll but I haven't played Yomi since the web client so I'm way out of practice and remembrance
[4:29:53] <nopethebard> True
[4:29:56] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> FANTASY STRIIIKE
[4:30:18] <+Lord0Mugen> Gloria is gonna be a weird one
[4:30:38] <shobbs001> @WoolieVersus thelo and 1 should finish it off with 1 team battle
[4:30:41] <%hatesdps> youre also asking a blanka player
[4:30:42] <+Lord0Mugen> Quice mirrors will probably just be urien Aegis REflectos
[4:31:14] <SirlinGames> Yes! Team battle
[4:31:37] <nopethebard> RIP Wooly

[4:31:50] <%SirGO0SE> apatDab woolieVS apatDab
[4:31:51] <SirlinGames> Well, it's Leontes
[4:31:58] <@Menitta> Oh shit
[4:31:59] <SirlinGames> sorry to disappoint :(
[4:32:07] <+Lord0Mugen> darn! I wanted to fight woolie!
[4:32:08] <%SirGO0SE> OH SHIT ROOK HUGGER
[4:32:19] <+G_R_A_G> Thelo, did you tell them about the frame advantage hitsparks
[4:32:20] <sunnythedrunk> Rook Hugger is a savage
[4:32:28] <%SirGO0SE> ROOK HUGGER! Shout outs from the COUCH FIGHTERS
[4:32:29] <+Amperture> Are Sirlin's forums still active?
[4:32:35] <%SirGO0SE> ive seen this boy do wooooooooooooork
[4:32:43] <sunnythedrunk> @SirGO0SE Weekend Warriors LUL
[4:32:44] <SirlinGames> Lol yeah, the Cranky Kong on the sirlin net design articles
[4:32:45] <nopethebard> Yes but FS is on Discord
[4:32:49] <+Lord0Mugen> COUCH FIghters?! WHERE?!
[4:32:56] <MiraiNoUsagi> I knew the menu art looked familiar, it was made by Genzoman
[4:32:58] <%SirGO0SE> @sunnythedrunk my brett <3
[4:33:20] <%SirGO0SE> rook knows this game inside and out man
[4:33:25] <BwdYeti> wow the hitspark color is great
[4:33:35] <SirlinGames> Yeah, you can see frame data kind of on the fly
[4:33:37] <%akira_chong> I just bought Yomi, and it's downloading to my laptop now.
[4:33:45] <SirlinGames> makes it easy to figure out if a move is safe/not during the course of a match
[4:33:46] <nopethebard> Awesome
[4:33:51] <+Lord0Mugen> brett? Is that the salty one?
[4:34:01] <SirlinGames> but of course it's also in Training mode along with really good frame data display
[4:34:24] <+G_R_A_G> that walk-up DP
[4:34:25] <sunnythedrunk> @supaXmugen Nah Brett's the knowledgeable one he played this dude on Weekend Warriors the spiritual successor to Couch Fighters
[4:34:41] <%SirGO0SE> Brett Bayone is the least salty fucker ever. Guy is about learning and doing it right
[4:34:50] <+CurubethionPrime> Yeah Brett is great, I want a pocket Brett who can teach me everything fighting games
[4:34:55] <%SirGO0SE> I've been dreaming for a Brett/Woolie crossover since forever
[4:35:01] <sunnythedrunk> SAME
[4:35:03] <+G_R_A_G> Brett's the best
[4:35:19] <+CurubethionPrime> My favorite thing in that series was Brett calling out all of Greg's greedy plays
[4:35:22] <BwdYeti> DEAD
[4:35:30] <%SirGO0SE> but I've been afraid to suggest it cause I feel like they'd both respond the same way "you just saying that cause we're black?"
[4:35:31] <SirlinGames> lol Val going for the chip
[4:35:34] <Mendin> I WILL BREAK YOU
[4:35:34] <alexpandajoker> Kappa
[4:35:39] <%GeeWilikers1> DIRTY
[4:35:49] <+MinimumPayne> puff the magic dragon
[4:35:53] <+CurubethionPrime> It feels so bad when I'm getting owned in dragon form
[4:35:54] <sunnythedrunk> PogChamp
[4:35:57] <%SirGO0SE> but for real Brett/Woolie wouldbe g0d tier
[4:36:03] <nopethebard> Btw Yomi tournaments and discussions are mainly on the Sirlin games forum
[4:36:10] <danielstretulch> So this game has 12 characters. Ghost and Dragon are 11 and 12.
[4:36:17] <deafmelone> @sirgo0se I second that
[4:36:31] <Mendin> Rainbow Disk a half-nich off the ground
[4:36:33] <+CurubethionPrime> Man Midori's grapple feels so satisfying
[4:36:39] <+CurubethionPrime> ADJUST YOUR BACK
[4:36:41] <division_ring> I mean, if you want to see depth in this game, watching what Thelo did to Reggie, and now what rook hugger is doing to Thelo....
[4:36:52] <%SirGO0SE> yknow what...fuck it
[4:37:05] <+G_R_A_G> Fantasy Strike: The honest, footsies-based fighter for beginners… that is also full of incredibly sleazy nonsense 👀
[4:37:12] <%SirGO0SE> does woolz have a minimum donation like pat does?
[4:37:55] <+CurubethionPrime> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:37:55] <danielstretulch> Rook Hugger got 3rd in the last tourney.
[4:38:06] <+CurubethionPrime> I think you could've lived with bubble
[4:38:13] <%SirGO0SE> and he's not even playing rook =x
[4:38:14] <+G_R_A_G> Rook Hugger is… competent
[4:38:36] <sunnythedrunk> Rook Hugger rotating on em

[4:40:17] <%SirGO0SE> also love thelo <3 wish you guys were hiring
[4:40:18] <+G_R_A_G> FS: Designed to let new players experience That Moment® as quickly as possible
[4:40:18] <Mendin> I wonder if Gloria would revolve around a move that gave both players 1hp back and if Gloria gained an HP, she gained super meter, and then one of her supers is a cinematic that causes both people (first her then the opponent) to lose 2 HP
[4:40:21] <%akira_chong> @crimsonharvest The only thing that went through the bowl of petunias' head was "Oh no, not again."
[4:40:29] <%Blazymaniac> bought my rtx ticket yesterday, im excited
