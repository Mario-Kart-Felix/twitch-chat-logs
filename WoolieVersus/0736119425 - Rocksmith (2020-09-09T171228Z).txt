[0:28:17] <+twohitgood> calluses are great. they let you pick up hot stuff easier.
[0:28:30] <Juako131415> dude Rocksmith won't have him play difficult cords until like an hour of gameplay minimum xD
[0:28:31] <%PipIV> Just break through the board. The arthritis comes later
[0:28:35] <mellorolo> that also helps with carpill's tunnel in general

[0:29:11] <@Menitta> Ah that makes sense
[0:29:16] <%PipIV> suuuure
[0:29:16] <CastleGeekSkull> but the 24th fret is where the magic happens
[0:29:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Drchandragupta cant you ust put the dots on backwards?
[0:29:18] <LegendGHT> why is this happening lol
[0:29:19] <Triplicat> if it's so custom why doesn't it have dots on the other side HahaDoge

[0:41:42] <%rottingpastry> lol yeah,
[0:41:43] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Drop D, easiest Power chords.
[0:41:46] <+twohitgood> floyds are argumentative like a mf.
[0:41:49] <%RyTYoung> I'm drop d to lets gooo
[0:41:49] <%doomerskeletor13> inb4 V’s channel copyright strikes this stream
[0:41:50] <%xchasemoney> xchasemoney subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! play one winged angel!
[0:41:50] <BlackDae> lower notes is what that means
[0:41:53] <%eriksdrums> Take the lowest note, make it lower @akuda_bar
[0:41:53] <+TheEmperorsEyebrows> is drop D just when your dick hits the floor?
[0:41:54] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @akuda_bar you tune the e string down to a d
[0:42:00] <@Solidus_113> You lower the thickest string by a whole octave
[0:42:01] <+twohitgood> blocked all mine off and I'm so much happier for it.
[0:42:03] <CastleGeekSkull> @akuda_bar you drop the lowest string's tuning from E to D if it is tuned in standard tuning
[0:42:07] <@akuda_bar> ah.
[0:42:09] <%PipIV> Gotta tune
[0:42:10] <Necnill> twitch tunes
[0:42:11] <masterfire23> no bttv RcardoFlick FeelsBadMan
[0:42:19] <+troxvon_the_lesser> It will be super wrong!
[0:42:20] <Flare3500> How do you tune ? get good with ears ?
[0:42:24] <+ChrisAlgoo> so the cool thing about drop D is you can play power chords witn one finger now
[0:42:26] <TungstenViper> IN GAME tuning
[0:42:26] <%ChoculaUltra> people who can tune by ear scare and amaze me at the same time
[0:42:27] <+itmegwimble> This is really wholesome to watch
[0:42:31] <Juako131415> just get woolie one of those expensive d tuning pedals or self tuning Gibsons LUL
[0:42:31] <CastleGeekSkull> @akuda_bar E to D is one step, two semi-tones, the equivalent of two frets apart on the guitar
[0:42:37] <%eriksdrums> @akuda_bar It also makes those power chords mentioned earlier WAYYY easier, and helps for the MEITAL

[0:43:21] <CastleGeekSkull> @Flare3500 they make tuners, you can get one for your phone, there are youtube videos you can tune to, and yeah eventually a lot of people learn to do it by ear
[0:43:30] <Flare3500> Holy shit there are apps now ? back in my day when I tried to learn the guitar literally get good was the answer for me
[0:43:33] <+neoexogene> @juako131415 i played one of those Gibson and holy shit it sucks, they break strings like crazy
[0:43:34] <+JingKaisean> how does the tuner work? is the guitar plugged into an interface?
[0:43:35] <+itmegwimble> Any idea if this is just a one-off or a regular thing? Because I'd love to see Woolie's adventure into learning an instrument

[1:06:24] <%Totally_Not_Toby> unironically though
[1:06:24] <marvel877> What's going on right now? Is Woolie finally starting that garage band he always said he was gonna do?
[1:06:25] <Juako131415> @akuda_bar YouTube is your friend LUL

[1:06:38] <MiltoniusPrime> You can just add lower difficulties
[1:06:40] <+VietcongSamurai> It's not dynamic on this one.

[1:06:57] <+Weeewer> Ah this looks like me playing
[1:06:58] <MiltoniusPrime> As someone who brings it to cons, you can prepare for stuff like this head of time

[1:07:24] <%Totally_Not_Toby> V do the thing where it slows the notes down for him
[1:07:33] <+ryuguitarfreak> He needs a slow down
[1:07:35] <+JingKaisean> not even close
[1:07:41] <Drchandragupta> ..what does this look like on max
[1:07:44] <+JingKaisean> pick easier song
[1:07:47] <AnthroMetal> not all CDLC has dynamic difficulty
[1:07:52] <+SideshowMessiah> Speed go down!
[1:07:53] <%Totally_Not_Toby> you can practice and make it slower to practice the notes
[1:07:54] <MiltoniusPrime> YOU CAN ADD DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY
[1:07:55] <AnthroMetal> @Drchandragupta this is hard
[1:07:56] <NekoZen> yeah just slow it
[1:08:00] <skullnaught> its like me playing
[1:08:05] <%eriksdrums> @ChrisAlgoo We've got some altered scale embellishments and certain microtonal influences from partial bends due to stress
[1:08:15] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Drchandragupta that was max, some custom songs don't have the dynamic difficulty because it wasn't put in
[1:08:21] <Juako131415> just teach him the song beforehand LUL
[1:08:22] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[1:08:36] <+ryuguitarfreak> He needs simple as hell riffs just to learn to go through the arm
[1:08:39] <+wunp_fxs> soooo easy
[1:08:46] <MiltoniusPrime> All you need to do is run it through Song Manager and you can add DD
[1:09:00] <%Totally_Not_Toby> some custom songs don't have dynamic difficulty
[1:09:07] <Juako131415> pc wants woolie to get good fast LUL
[1:09:15] <MiltoniusPrime> Dude
[1:09:18] <MiltoniusPrime> If you see a flat orange line, no DD
[1:09:25] <MiltoniusPrime> Easy as that
[1:09:46] <+RealPT1> if you don't see the purple bars above the sections there's no difficulty adjustment
[1:09:59] <Juako131415> rip
[1:10:11] <MiltoniusPrime> Please get CustomsForge Song Manager if you're planning to play with someone who isn't always playing at 100% difficulty
[1:10:13] <%eriksdrums> Em C D for those playing the home gam
[1:10:13] <+aspirationdeath> yeah this doesnt have dd. you can tell because of the static orange bar instead of the big boxes signifying song completion
[1:10:16] <leonaden> why not show him string skip saloon or ducks redux first?
[1:10:26] <snakemuho> TIME TO MASH
[1:10:31] <showingjens0n> trying to play this while reading the notes off my phone is a bit difficult
[1:10:37] <%The_Timo> Making me want to dig up my old guitar and play along haha

[1:12:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> Wait, is this really happening right now?
[1:12:53] <MiltoniusPrime> I'm assuming Little V just plays full difficulty all the time and doesn't need to worry about anyone else joining in
[1:12:53] <Sternieliscious> This really takes me back to spending my weekends learning Chrono Cross jams.
[1:12:55] <Nohorse> WutFace
[1:12:56] <NikolasKage> @very_ap3 that's what it looks like, definitely not a fender tele
[1:12:58] <bhaysic> kind of sounds like rolling start lol
[1:13:04] <Heefnoff> Exactly lol
[1:13:05] <leroypi> As someone who’s melody experience is through melody percussion instruments and one semester of piano classes, I can see this being overwhelming

[1:35:37] <+Deko_> LUL
[1:35:50] <snakemuho> maybe the sensitivity is a bit different, since Woolie made noise with all the strings but is playing with just one?
[1:36:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> at first I thought it was Flappy Bird
[1:36:22] <%Solidnick18> birrrrrd
[1:36:24] <very_ap3> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz ty! I never have tried the game and its lookin p cool ngl
[1:36:30] <@Solidus_113> palm mute the strings
[1:36:32] <%eriksdrums> (V could you kindly ask Woolie to avoid the ol devil's interval?)
[1:36:35] <%chll0ne> LUL
[1:36:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> Your right palm is your volume knob
[1:36:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what's the devils interval
[1:36:49] <+scariestbrain> What kinda guitar is woolie using, I joined late so I missed it if they already said

[1:37:34] <snorlaxbud> Oooo banana
[1:37:39] <%eriksdrums> @cobalt_phoenix_ Haha, it's the space between two notes that was once considered so ugly, legends say that you could get excommunicated from the church for putting it in music
[1:37:44] <+neoexogene> Unfortunately discontinued
[1:38:00] <+neoexogene> It was a great guitar for the money
[1:38:01] <lunnprod> yea and thats also a lie there's church music which uses tritones lol

[1:38:23] <%eriksdrums> @cobalt_phoenix_ Unfortunately, that's an exagerated story, but it's still fun to tell. If you're wondering, you can most easily play it on a piano by playing F and B at the same time

[2:04:48] <RyuShinden> IT"S TIME TO PIERCE THE HEAVENS PogChamp
[2:04:52] <%HDmexiqtioner> You heard of Dropping Frames, how about Dropping D.
[2:04:56] <RealDurdyDan> Can you play this with an audio interface?
[2:04:57] <+jiggy_snipe> V is right
[2:04:57] <%NirreMusic> next stream v teaches woolie how to work a daw
[2:04:58] <+ryuguitarfreak> Drop C?
[2:05:00] <BigLoserJosh> this is so cool oh my god
[2:05:02] <+scariestbrain> everyone donate so this can happen more
[2:05:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alright, Little V, now play with Delay Based Netcode.
[2:05:12] <+ryuguitarfreak> Are they doing it on computer?
[2:05:13] <@akuda_bar> the first time i saw woolie i was at magfest playing sorairo days on jubeat and i panicked because i wanted to finish the song.
[2:05:17] <RyuShinden> COOP MODE
[2:05:28] <DaBigVitus> imagine when he learns he can stroke up and down!
[2:05:30] <Fear_Ranjer> YEEEA KILLIN IT
[2:05:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @akuda_bar You must ALWAYS finish the song.
[2:05:38] <TheAmazingClaytor> Holy FUCK that axe
[2:05:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> They have the perfect notes for TROGDOR too
[2:05:48] <%RyTYoung> I think Woolie needs his own guitar after this stream!
[2:05:49] <+ryuguitarfreak> That's an AXE
[2:05:54] <+theKingRamses> that sounded a little like that one soundgarden song for a second
[2:05:56] <scrublord009> Did I miss Woolie Djent?
[2:05:57] <@akuda_bar> @CommanderSqueaks i did finish the song
[2:06:05] <+neoexogene> It’s so wholesome to see Woolie enjoys himself
[2:06:23] <brunoberserk> give me some divine hate from dmc3
[2:06:24] <ThePimpGuin> next gon in 60 seconds, john shows up and suddenly "why am I hearing boss music"
[2:06:28] <%RyTYoung> Jam sessions are always fun
[2:06:32] <%danguinplays> I want this wholesome stream once a week
[2:06:32] <RyuShinden> We gotta have Woolie learn Sorairo Days PogChamp
[2:06:35] <RunoEddie> who even cares about Rocksmith at this point, just give Woolie guitar lessons!
[2:06:38] <TheAmazingClaytor> So after this, is Woolie gonna teach V how to play 3rd Strike gud?

[3:08:06] <+amurter19> I never looked at the minigames in this lol
[3:08:17] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Chords f'ing suck just lemme play power chords and single notes all day
[3:08:23] <GKannel> L
[3:08:27] <+brightman42> they're pretty fun, I had the top score on Ducks for a hot minute
[3:08:27] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> my bitch baby fingers can't do em
[3:08:29] <+scariestbrain> at least get barre chords
[3:08:35] <dinnydanny777> Are guitar chords different to piano chords?
[3:08:36] <+Tonku_the_Red> @ppi1993 You know it!
[3:08:37] <%Totally_Not_Toby> all the minigames are great, but this one is probably the best
[3:08:40] <@Menitta> Oh wow this game is cool
[3:08:59] <%RyTYoung> sick
[3:09:00] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @dinnydanny777 No, but the way a guitar lays out the strings, it makes for interesting hand shapes depending on your tuning
[3:09:06] <+scariestbrain> power chords and barre chords and you can pretend you know what youre doin just fine
[3:09:25] <DrkJP520> Brutal Legend in first person
[3:09:28] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @scariestbrain All you need for punk rock
[3:09:38] <+jotaro_cooljo> power chords and you're basically green day
[3:09:43] <+scariestbrain> punk rock you just need a guitar hahah
[3:09:49] <@akuda_bar> fuck those bats
[3:09:56] <+Deko_> EZ
[3:10:00] <+WinstonWolfey> holy shit this is intense
[3:10:07] <GKannel> the cleaner you play, the better it registers
[3:10:20] <@akuda_bar> don't press F5
[3:10:28] <+scariestbrain> pinkies CAN do that
[3:10:32] <+WinstonWolfey> POWER CHORD BABYYYYY
[3:10:33] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Punk may not have difficult notes but you gotta at least play em fast lol
[3:10:38] <%RyTYoung> YOUR PINKG CAN
[3:10:40] <GKannel> you gotta pinky
[3:10:40] <ppi1993> 1 3 4
[3:10:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> The blue note is fluff
[3:10:55] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Damn woolie not bad
[3:10:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wow this is actually really interesting.
[3:11:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I might have to get this if I decide to relearn bass.
[3:11:11] <+WinstonWolfey> The blue note is what makes it a chord
[3:11:13] <dinnydanny777> Does Punk have such yelly vocals because the singers don't know how to sing and play guitar?
[3:11:16] <+WinstonWolfey> otherwise its just an interval
[3:11:17] <%kewlmyc> F
[3:11:24] <+brightman42> nice
[3:11:28] <+scariestbrain> probably but thats part of why its so sick
[3:11:33] <%RyTYoung> I think I'm going to pick this up soon
[3:11:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> BOOMER
[3:11:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> @WinstonWolfey that's backwards
[3:11:46] <+WinstonWolfey> no
[3:11:47] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @dinnydanny777 Yes its mostly just passion that makes it so good
[3:11:48] <+WinstonWolfey> its not
[3:12:00] <+WinstonWolfey> 3 notes make a chord
[3:12:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> If you say so
[3:12:04] <ppi1993> just wait till he discovers barre chords
[3:12:11] <+scariestbrain> what is: power chord
[3:12:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Play the Fuck Chord to kill the zombinos

[3:13:37] <dreadedcthulhu> REFRESH REFRESH REFRESH
[3:13:39] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> I mean a power chord is technically a chord but without the 3rd note it's not really minor or major
[3:13:46] <thenamelessant> the kids love the devil!
[3:13:52] <GKannel> you can hit it's projectiles
[3:14:23] <%RyTYoung> You're doing gooood
[3:14:49] <+brightman42> has he played before, this is pretty good if it's his first session
[3:14:55] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @bossingtonhuggermugger the 3rd is generally implied by the key or current chord progresssion
[3:15:09] <GKannel> V is playing now
[3:15:31] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @abelincoln_catpuncher oh fair point, I was just thinking of the chord alone

[3:17:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> You gotta remember, to play this game you NEED a guitar.
[3:17:52] <Triplicat> so was Treasure Mountain/Cove/Galaxy
[3:17:52] <Sternieliscious> Chord-Evil
[3:17:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> Shit's expensive
[3:18:09] <Explodincatz> gg
[3:18:15] <+Reecer6> i don't play guitar and don't have a prominent interest to learn but i'm still always really endeared to this game
[3:18:27] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @CappuccinoGuil Well, if you already want a guitar you can get a $150 one though I wouldn't recommend it
[3:18:39] <+Ancopro> well i rmember as a kid the idea of this was actually learn guitar instead of guitar hero, but i was like naw tho 5 buttons plz
[3:18:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> around $100 for the cheapest viable guitar
[3:18:53] <aura_00> @CappuccinoGuil the guitar isn't even the the most costly part, the cable can cost a fuckton as well
[3:18:58] <GKannel> scale
[3:19:04] <+AnalogueHeart> if you want a cheap guitar you can't go wrong with Harley Benton stuff
[3:19:06] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Getting a cheap guitar is kind of a bad idea IMO, you'll hate playing it
[3:19:09] <+RealPT1> Temple of Bends is fun
[3:19:30] <+brightman42> such a chill narrator
[3:19:31] <+AnalogueHeart> they're instruments of a good quality at a cheap ass price
[3:19:34] <%afronooch> sinking a couple hundreds into a brand new hobby isn't really the best idea
[3:19:42] <%DSD24> My own MyBand
[3:19:52] <+Toshatron> Yamaha do some good quality entry guitars with their pacifica line too
[3:19:55] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Well, no, but you'd know that going in
[3:19:57] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I disagree, you dont need to spend 500 bucks to get a decent axe. 200 is perfect for a decent starting guitar
[3:19:58] <+Reecer6> multhaiplayer
[3:20:02] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Multee or Multhai?
[3:20:08] <Ganfur> I have like a 150 dollar guitar, it works I guess lol
[3:20:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> This game is just not cheap to start, let alone play. That explains why it went under the radar
[3:20:11] <+neoexogene> I HATE the way he says it
[3:20:40] <%DSD24> Huey Lewis and the News?
[3:20:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:20:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> @abelincoln_catpuncher so buy the game and a guitar and the cable. Or, buy a game that doesn't require all that. You see the decision players would make here?
[3:21:04] <+neoexogene> @abelincoln_catpuncher absolutely, Harley Benton guitars are a great example of ridiculously low price for good quality
[3:21:04] <+brightman42> a fun thing about this is it upgraded into the next version instead of doing another sequel
[3:21:19] <+thehotrefrigerator> WoolieVs Music Lessons?!?
[3:21:20] <+thehotrefrigerator> I love it
[3:21:22] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @CappuccinoGuil Totally a fair point, but they've always been marketing towards people who want to play guitar, less people who just want to play a game
[3:21:24] <GKannel> you can shift down to make it easier
[3:21:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> write it on your soul
[3:21:28] <+amurter19> All my starter guitars were like 250
[3:21:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> oh definitely, I think this game is better at helping a guitarist/bassist keep practicing and learning songs
[3:21:47] <GKannel> so that it's not on 12
[3:21:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Bossingtonhuggermugger not disagreeing there, but you see then why this flies under most people's radars, right?
[3:22:00] <%Trair> Trair subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey woolie have you ever touched mass effect? As a die hard halo fan I’m going thru it now and it scratches the same itch as well as the Kotor itch. Stay safe :)
[3:22:07] <abelincoln_catpuncher> than persay a newbie just getting into it
[3:22:09] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> @CappuccinoGuil for sure
[3:22:15] <+brightman42> I think I got my guitar for 300 when I bought the first rocksmith
[3:22:21] <RyuShinden> SourPls
[3:22:22] <+r_squared1672> you can buy a cheap squire strat for ~$100 and it will work great. You have big name bands using Squiers, and they sound fine. They are great starter guitars and you can sell it, and get a more expensive one once you know you'll stick with it.
[3:22:25] <ppi1993> anchor your pick hand wool

[3:43:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine playing one lick and getting DMCA'd for 50 songs at the same time.
[3:43:57] <%Aztec50> Is the most popular music some of the easiest to play?
[3:44:03] <Sternieliscious> Yes.
[3:44:06] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Yep
[3:44:07] <+entryteam> typically
[3:44:08] <Sllypper> I love this kind of content
[3:44:12] <Tisaric> popular is definitely usually easier to play
[3:44:13] <+RealThiele> well with 50 dmcas its like letthemfight dot jpeg
[3:44:14] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Easy to play, easy to hear, easy to $$$
[3:44:14] <Sllypper> I never thought about it before
[3:44:15] <BwdYeti> yo rocksmith PogChamp
[3:44:22] <@akuda_bar> my high school played pachelbel and I had to play the same four notes for like ten minutes straight while everyone else got to weebly weebly
[3:44:23] <Tisaric> but it doesn't mean that all popular music is easy to play
[3:44:24] <+brightman42> guitar even has its own notation like fighting games
[3:44:29] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Canon Rock
[3:44:32] <+brightman42> sorta similar even
[3:44:34] <AnthroMetal> @akuda_bar cello huh

[3:45:09] <+TheWingedBeatle> @Tisaric As a former cellist, can confirm
[3:45:13] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Japan plays by its own rules. Sheena Ringo is insane

[3:45:21] <dinnydanny777> That sounds very Indie
[3:45:21] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Anime music is Major scale punk rock
[3:45:23] <@akuda_bar> i hate it @AnthroMetal
[3:45:27] <robobeau> Sounded a bit like Beat Crusaders
[3:45:31] <AnthroMetal> I feel you lol
[3:45:32] <+neoexogene> Japan is way more sophisticated in terms of chords
[3:45:36] <Tisaric> unfortunately haven't had a cello in years now but it sticks with you
[3:45:38] <@akuda_bar> i got my comeup in Mars, or New World, but pachelbel can eat my butt
[3:45:39] <+neoexogene> Just listen to Math Rock
[3:45:45] <+jiggy_snipe> @cobalt_phoenix_ no he's showing all the secrets to popular music
[3:45:50] <+VorpalSlash> Japan can fuckin guitar
[3:45:51] <Tisaric> yo but Jupiter though
[3:45:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Quarter Tones is fucking insanity.
[3:45:59] <SomersaultJustice> play tunak tunak tun
[3:46:00] <+Reecer6> look if you can't hit quartertones on your guitar what's the point
[3:46:02] <+brightman42> 12 notes in various octaves
[3:46:04] <Tisaric> Microtonal Banana though
[3:46:05] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> And usually only 7 in a scale, so honestly even less typically
