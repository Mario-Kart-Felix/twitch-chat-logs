[0:05:27] <@Solidus_113> Kiwami means extreme
[0:05:49] <kirin_fellwinter> Cheer500 Had a question for you 2: The new MK11 character pack was just announced and my lifelong main (since mk2) Mileena has had her design rolled back to her original design instead of, in my opinion, her better MKX design. Have either of you two ever had something you thought was an improvement get rolled back? p.s. V love your music, your cover of Tast the blood is final boss level status.
[0:05:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:50] <%marrs_bars> Kiwami does in fact mean extreme
[0:05:51] <%a_goth_pancake> so is kiwami 2 a remake of 2?
[0:06:02] <andre11dr> Yep
[0:06:06] <%Lion_kun> 1 is one of the worse ones.
[0:06:17] <+condemned_15> Kiwami means Extreme and Katana means Japanese Sword

[0:21:21] <raikagelord1> LUL LUL LUL
[0:21:23] <%jinking79> Castlevania Judgment Design did not like any of them
[0:21:27] <%DomunDomunDomun> Tape V to the ceiling.
[0:21:29] <+wunp_fxs> xbox time
[0:21:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHype Taking it back
[0:21:40] <JaceDarkstar> black flag xD
[0:21:42] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Fuck yeah, made it to a stream for once
[0:21:53] <jackelzxaa> wow
[0:21:54] <%DukeAtomic> DukeAtomic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! XBOX SAVE MY MARRIAGE
[0:22:02] <jackelzxaa> woolie has to get used to split screen now
[0:22:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYYEYE
[0:22:06] <%TheEpicTree> nExT Lp
[0:22:06] <+yhom_tork> PogChamp
[0:22:08] <%a_goth_pancake> BLACQ FLAGE
[0:22:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS
[0:22:17] <jackelzxaa> no vertical splitscreen
[0:22:28] <Chatterbox1991> i thought about nailing my flat screen to an angled ceiling about where my bed would have been so i could play staring upwards
[0:22:32] <+wunp_fxs> Try legendary
[0:22:32] <dreadedcthulhu> this is SO much harder to parse in splitscreen lmao
[0:22:32] <%a_goth_pancake> PogChamp
[0:22:33] <%TheGunrunner91> woolieGLORY
[0:22:33] <f0rgeman> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:22:37] <+yhom_tork> its fucking hard
[0:22:46] <dot_theory> the weighted clothing comes off
[0:22:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:22:59] <JaceDarkstar> I'm glad woolie experienced big boy mode
[0:23:01] <jackelzxaa> woolie getting to experience real solo halo is the best
[0:23:13] <rytisone> now Woolie is Haloing
[0:23:15] <derap41> That's the "true" ODST experience
[0:23:18] <Heyestus> splitscreen was always massively easier just because of the revive feature.
[0:23:18] <%a_goth_pancake> bc you're not a badass genetically engineered super soldier ... you're just a regular super soldier.
[0:23:22] <pjbuster> you got to use your hands after you run out, like in doom
[0:23:34] <dinnydanny777> This is the Legend of Some Guy
[0:23:35] <Minerslovegames> Oh yeah, I got two hunters on my ass in the city a couple days ago on Legendary. I just ran.
[0:23:41] <%TheEpicTree> Sound??
[0:23:42] <jackelzxaa> a blessing in disguise
[0:23:46] <+chase959> gameso3Pimp
[0:23:48] <derap41> V is power bottom confirmed
[0:23:50] <%mikesapartment> didn't picture V as a bottom
[0:23:51] <dinnydanny777> Halo 1-3-Reach is the Legend of Halo Mans, this is The Legend of Some Guy
[0:24:06] <jackelzxaa> woolie's crashes gave him the benefit of getting an excuse to play some real haloboy time
[0:24:08] <RamenRiderZ> Elites on Legendary are a tussle and two
[0:24:08] <BritishTyrannosaur> You guys enjoying odst firefight. rediscovering how good it is
[0:24:12] <%KiboSenshi> please no crashing odst
[0:24:14] <%a_goth_pancake> v is a bottom woolieSMUG
[0:24:24] <andre11dr> V is a power bottom
[0:24:24] <pjbuster> in odst do you not play as john haloman?
[0:24:32] <%TheEpicTree> oh it's just kind of quiet
[0:24:42] <RickSaintRiot> in ODST you play as Jimmy the Trooper
[0:24:44] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[0:24:44] <%a_goth_pancake> this confirms woolie is a top
[0:24:51] <dinnydanny777> Wow Destiny is that old?
[0:24:55] <JaceDarkstar> I'm paraphrasing ya heathens
[0:24:58] <RickSaintRiot> named for the Iron Maiden song
[0:25:00] <+JeluxDaCasual> @pjbuster it's in the name. You are an ODST
[0:25:02] <%DomunDomunDomun> @pjbuster You play as a dude, and the cast of firefly.
[0:25:04] <%DukeAtomic> Destiny is from 2014
[0:25:05] <JaceDarkstar> best line
[0:25:08] <%DukeAtomic> So I think
[0:25:13] <BritishTyrannosaur> we really are the odst
[0:25:14] <xxshadowxx416> can woolie look at game pass
[0:25:15] <%DukeAtomic> A year later than the XBONE release?
[0:25:18] <Nomad94> We're not past the point when it crashed last time, right?
[0:25:22] <+Thesson> aaaaaah
[0:25:24] <RickSaintRiot> and the theme song is also "The Trooper" by Iron Maiden
[0:25:34] <BritishTyrannosaur> maybe the real ost was inside us all along
[0:25:35] <ThatChainmecha> im getting paid to watch your stream
[0:25:38] <%TheGunrunner91> I just recently turned my PS4 on, and found out that FB integration was gone.
[0:25:45] <%TheGunrunner91> so its been a bit
[0:25:55] <+condemned_15> get on the floor, and then walk the dinosaur
[0:25:59] <%jinking79> hate Xbone hub and store update
[0:26:12] <RickSaintRiot> like da dadadala dadadala da da duh
[0:26:20] <%TheGunrunner91> I miss the Blades theme
[0:26:41] <Nomad94> has there been a patch, or are we just hoping the game is less buggy this time
[0:26:46] <BritishTyrannosaur> anyone getting the new halo book when it's out?
[0:26:48] <RickSaintRiot> and then the high pitched guitar comes in like DA DADADALA DA DADADALA DA DA DUH DA DUH
[0:26:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Nomad94 xbox
[0:27:00] <+JeluxDaCasual> @Nomad94 Console dude
[0:27:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1315888762120011783?s=19
[0:27:03] <derap41> Its more of a survival experience
[0:27:03] <Nomad94> oh, nice
[0:27:09] <RickSaintRiot> yannamean?
[0:27:26] <Nomad94> @RickSaintRiot i'unnoman
[0:27:26] <dinnydanny777> Imagine how salty it makes the Covenant to die to you though
[0:27:41] <RickSaintRiot> s'oke
[0:27:48] <rytisone> chief or grunt, it plays very similar tho minus dual wield
[0:28:01] <%D00msDayDan> Halo 3 ODST: avoid the fight
[0:28:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> This is making me feel big nostalgia
[0:28:28] <Nomad94> ODST: Finish the fight if it's not too hard
[0:28:46] <Minerslovegames> I love how playing as humans really puts into perspective how big the Covenant are. Like brutes tower over you and hunters are behemoths.
[0:28:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> One of the upside of them switiching to XBONE is that we get Halo 4 right away
[0:28:59] <+yhom_tork> friends? lionFeels
[0:29:13] <andre11dr> I played ODST once when it came out, so this it basically new to me
[0:29:30] <BritishTyrannosaur> Really want to see how woolie reacts to halo 4. Hope he likes it
[0:29:30] <%TheEpicTree> @yeeter_baelish T_T
[0:29:33] <jackelzxaa> i'll probably play odst between 2 and 3 when i do my runs, and then reach after 3 and then 4 after
[0:29:35] <Nomad94> No breaking
[0:29:50] <jackelzxaa> imagine if the console version desynced too
[0:30:00] <jackelzxaa> in splitscreen
[0:30:05] <+JeluxDaCasual> IMAGINE
[0:30:05] <%a_goth_pancake> bout a decade.
[0:30:10] <@Solidus_113> double the grunting sounds
[0:30:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @jackelzxaa At that point you just put down the controller and cry
[0:30:14] <%ZeroCruz> And now the xbone just blows up
[0:30:17] <+yhom_tork> woolie trained PogChamp
[0:30:25] <centuronstar> He's beginning to believe
[0:30:25] <MajoraZ> good shit woolie
[0:30:26] <+JeluxDaCasual> @a_goth_pancake They're playing Xbone MCC ODST
[0:30:29] <+GruntOfAction> Woolie's gone through extensive ODST training
[0:30:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ZeroCruz Jackal snipes it
[0:30:34] <Orien358> finally woolie found his zen
[0:30:36] <%BisoromiBear> he's doing it bros
[0:30:37] <%TheEpicTree> Damn Woolie
[0:30:38] <jackelzxaa> woolie good at halo now
[0:30:44] <jackelzxaa> woolie carries V now
[0:30:47] <+Thesson> I feel like woolie has gone through "Live, Die, Repeat"
[0:30:49] <f0rgeman> @jackelzxaa if you're playing throguh for the first time I recommend playing in release order. that way you can experience the game engine upgrades as and gameplay changes as well
[0:30:49] <+ZacharyWile> Woolie with prep time
[0:30:55] <%DukeAtomic> Woolie spent six years at the odst academy
[0:31:01] <%JetpackMcQuack> Might have to bump up the difficulty again 4Head
[0:31:06] <+yhom_tork> BOP
[0:31:06] <Jashter18> Woolie has come out of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber
[0:31:15] <%TheEpicTree> He just wouldn't die
[0:31:15] <%DukeAtomic> The time skip
[0:31:17] <rytisone> homerun
[0:31:19] <jackelzxaa> no i want to do odst before 3 for reasons. i know the spoilers already because i used to not give halo a chance and just absorbed spoilers without caring
[0:31:20] <subjectg> firefight would be cool with this view
[0:31:24] <RickSaintRiot> go back outside
[0:31:24] <JaceDarkstar> you burned the invincible
[0:31:25] <%a_goth_pancake> rrrrrr--HE'S ANGRAY
[0:31:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:31:26] <Minerslovegames> That solo run made Woolie git gud.
[0:31:28] <RickSaintRiot> he won't follow iirc
[0:31:31] <Nomad94> One angry boy
[0:31:36] <pjbuster> sage mode woolie over here
[0:31:38] <dreadedcthulhu> v use ur firebomb
[0:31:38] <Nomad94> One dead boy
[0:31:44] <%DukeAtomic> @jackelzxaa doing ODST before 3 is a great move
[0:31:46] <jackelzxaa> halo 3 is the end of the fight and i like ending on an ending
[0:31:48] <Minerslovegames> Firebombs are the BEST.
[0:31:51] <%DukeAtomic> It's not like doing Reach First
[0:31:58] <jackelzxaa> doing reach first seems bizarre
[0:31:58] <hot_take_jake> Eyyyyyy I'm watching the anime & reading the manga simultaneously now 😂
[0:31:59] <%DukeAtomic> ODST nicely ties 2 and 3 together
[0:32:07] <Minerslovegames> Guaranteed kill if you nail an enemy with it.
[0:32:08] <centuronstar> Woolie starting to tap into that Ultra Instinct
[0:32:12] <%DukeAtomic> Especially with the gameplay choices
[0:32:13] <RickSaintRiot> Reach A Stopping Point In The Fight
[0:32:14] <jackelzxaa> but odst at least has the benefit of happening roughly during 2's time period and events
[0:32:22] <RickSaintRiot> Quit The Fight While You're Up One
[0:32:23] <%TheEpicTree> Big Coward
[0:32:25] <%a_goth_pancake> reach into ce is a serious bad idea.
[0:32:41] <Nomad94> I forgot about those things
[0:32:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> My PC temperature is idling at 69C
[0:32:50] <BritishTyrannosaur> Only bad side about odst is it ties a lot into 2 but if you are looking for tie in's to 3 you get basically nothing
[0:32:51] <Nomad94> Nice
[0:32:51] <%a_goth_pancake> ok wash
[0:32:56] <RickSaintRiot> Two Out Of Three Fights Finished Ain't Half Bad
[0:32:56] <andre11dr> Starting with Reach is definitely a bad idea
[0:33:00] <jackelzxaa> doing reach as an intermission between 3 and 4 seems like the best time even if it wasn't release order
[0:33:04] <@Solidus_113> dmr
[0:33:10] <jackelzxaa> considering how 3 ends with chief going into the fridge
[0:33:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Why would you not play in release order?
[0:33:21] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus carbine
[0:33:22] <thebalticguy1> no BR in this game
[0:33:23] <Halospaz117> The Silenced SMG?
[0:33:23] <BritishTyrannosaur> Halo 4 is a very post reach game for better or worse
[0:33:25] <RickSaintRiot> Halo Wars when
[0:33:25] <jackelzxaa> because i always play in wacky orders
[0:33:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Man Woolie is ginna love THAT Hako 4 gun
[0:33:28] <+GruntOfAction> Technically there's a battle rifle in firefight customs
[0:33:29] <JaceDarkstar> no br or dmr in odst
[0:33:30] <Ynkubus_> There is 1 battle rifle in this game and only a npc has it in a cutscene
[0:33:30] <thebalticguy1> silenced smg
[0:33:33] <jackelzxaa> i played dmc3 first back in the day and mgs2 first
[0:33:40] <dinnydanny777> The Covenamt Rifle is great
[0:33:47] <jackelzxaa> i just play whatever i'm interested in tbh
[0:33:52] <malcobraaklynny> why are they doing split screen this time?
[0:33:54] <%D00msDayDan> Carbine
[0:33:55] <%a_goth_pancake> just die woolz
[0:33:56] <therealtacopancakes> so halo 4 confirmed now that the xbone is out of the freezer?
[0:33:58] <+yhom_tork> carbine is pretty good
[0:34:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @malcobraaklynny PC verson borked
[0:34:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:34:02] <Minerslovegames> Only one who had the battle rifle was that poor police officer who got iced by that brute chieftain in Romeo's mission.
[0:34:09] <Nomad94> @malcobraaklynny playing on xbox so the game won't crash, for one
[0:34:11] <jackelzxaa> i think the marvel movies are best when you don't watch them in release order, for instance, because you get bogged down and bored doing release order
[0:34:12] <%a_goth_pancake> wait no, buck doesn't get a smig
[0:34:18] <andre11dr> As someone that watched Gundam in chronological order, i learned that maybe sometimes you really shouldn't go chronology
[0:34:19] <subjectg> woolie’s finally understanding headshot weapons, the day’s finally come
[0:34:20] <%ZeroCruz> 4? What 4?
[0:34:21] <%TheEpicTree> rip
[0:34:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MELTED
[0:34:22] <malcobraaklynny> @BallerSwagBro9k @Nomad94 ah
[0:34:25] <dreadedcthulhu> this game's smg is the best smg in the series imo
[0:34:30] <BritishTyrannosaur> Sad that wollie won't get the corrupt cop at the end of the lp tbh
[0:34:33] <JaceDarkstar> hey woolie there's a scarb
[0:34:39] <Decimated_body> @malcobraaklynny they're playing on xbone
[0:34:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Halo after Reach... NotLikeThis
[0:34:42] <dreadedcthulhu> second best pistol with that scope and fire rate too
[0:34:44] <Minerslovegames> precision weapon and sprayer are the ideal loadout.
[0:34:45] <jackelzxaa> i usually go for unique orders because you can accomidate for different benefits, instead of release or chronological being the only 2 options
[0:34:47] <RickSaintRiot> Marvel movies are best watching them in the 0th order order. where you watch them all simultaneously
[0:34:47] <%a_goth_pancake> @woolieversus kill v and take his smig when he respawns
[0:34:58] <+yhom_tork> watched gundam 79 recently SeemsGood
[0:35:01] <Bigyanno> That was some Ultra Instinct Woolie right there
[0:35:03] <dreadedcthulhu> just mow down an entire horde of grunts
[0:35:04] <thebalticguy1> blow up the mines
[0:35:09] <Minerslovegames> Something to strip the shields away and then a headshot rifle or something to waste them.
[0:35:17] <RickSaintRiot> and every time a new Marvel movie comes out, you just watch all of them simultaneously again, just adding the new one
[0:35:26] <%DukeAtomic> @CanadianAnimatorGuy For this one instance, I think that ODST, as it's a side story, feels more impactful when played alongside the journey. And it's a thing where the gameplay changes are sort of designed to be between 2 and 3 anyway, so it sort of fits mechanically
[0:35:43] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Jump on board!
[0:35:45] <jackelzxaa> theres that one edit people made of the tournament of power where they edited all of the fights footage to run simultaneously and in real time
[0:35:45] <rytisone> or you can just get on board
[0:35:48] <%ZeroCruz> @yeeter_baelish YEAH 0079 BABY!
[0:35:56] <%a_goth_pancake> plasma rifle+pistol=unstoppable
[0:35:57] <jackelzxaa> best way to watch db super
[0:35:59] <RickSaintRiot> side note: funny thing how the English language devolves
[0:36:00] <andre11dr> @yeeter_baelish That was a hell of an ending for the villain huh?
[0:36:05] <+yhom_tork> char = chad
[0:36:10] <Nomad94> with every scarab fight, there's some way to get on board nearby
[0:36:12] <+yhom_tork> yeah it was so good
[0:36:27] <+yhom_tork> going through zeta right now
[0:36:33] <%a_goth_pancake> jus fly above and jump of
[0:36:40] <subjectg> bright carried the white base
[0:36:43] <sniffy77> No
[0:36:44] <Nomad94> Those can't die, V
[0:36:46] <xxshadowxx416> no
[0:36:48] <%ZeroCruz> Kamille is man's name ok
[0:36:55] <Snakes_dk> SourPls
[0:36:55] <Orien358> no you can not kill them
[0:36:56] <+GruntOfAction> I checked, the scarabs in Reach don't have a destroyable butt thing
[0:36:58] <+yhom_tork> titans did nothing wrong Kappa
[0:36:59] <kikoeru_san> Bright Noa charried the first part of the UC
[0:37:02] <malcobraaklynny> nah they're invincible
[0:37:09] <kikoeru_san> He carried CCA
[0:37:14] <Bigyanno> Press B, you've got a fuel rod right there
[0:37:18] <andre11dr> Now imagine going from 79 to ms team to Thunderbolt, because that's what i did and oh boy
[0:37:32] <%TheEpicTree> Why!!! T_T
[0:37:32] <kikoeru_san> Oh you must have had a time
[0:37:34] <subjectg> captain motherfucking bright helming the most dysfunctional family ever at 19
[0:37:35] <sniffy77> Nooo engies
[0:37:36] <andre11dr> And then War in the pocket
[0:37:41] <jackelzxaa> this is what it feels like to play halo and not have to worry about crashes
[0:37:45] <subjectg> if only we could be so accomplished
[0:37:51] <xxshadowxx416> no
[0:37:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Thye have virtual trainig
[0:37:57] <malcobraaklynny> I think they actualy are
[0:37:57] <kikoeru_san> You could be me and watch CCA right after Zeta
[0:38:00] <Ynkubus_> Random grunts?
[0:38:02] <Bigyanno> ODSTs aren't random grunts
[0:38:04] <derap41> Probably a lot of sims
[0:38:20] <Bigyanno> ODSTs are highly trained shock troops
[0:38:23] <subjectg> i went 0079-zeta-spinoffs-cca and came out ok
[0:38:27] <malcobraaklynny> Mickey mentions having piloted a phantom in a training sim
[0:38:31] <kikoeru_san> CCA is just bad
[0:38:33] <%a_goth_pancake> ODSTs are shock troopers; elite soldiers.
[0:38:35] <%ZeroCruz> I want to watch UC in timeline order for funsies some day
[0:38:36] <+ZoltanBMagnus> cole protocal probably
[0:38:39] <+yhom_tork> zeta is cool so far
[0:38:41] <jackelzxaa> odst is spy fiction\
[0:38:46] <+ZoltanBMagnus> protocol*
[0:38:51] <BritishTyrannosaur> but whatabout the CWOLE PWOTOCOL
[0:38:52] <Nomad94> ODSTs are the next best thing after Spartans though
[0:38:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> They do do sims
[0:38:53] <subjectg> cca is alright when you take out the gigantic plot tumor that is quess fucking paraya
[0:38:57] <kikoeru_san> I went from best Char to worst Char
[0:39:10] <kikoeru_san> I wanted to DIE
[0:39:16] <%a_goth_pancake> it's also thirty years into the war
[0:39:21] <rytisone> Mickey, I think mentions doing covenant flying sims
[0:39:23] <jackelzxaa> theres probably books about covenant training
[0:39:32] <%TheEpicTree> cOlE pRoToCol
[0:39:40] <stormhawk9891> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:39:41] <+ZacharyWile> No subs?
[0:39:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Turn on subtitles!
[0:39:48] <+wunp_fxs> The rookie parts are the best imo
[0:39:48] <%a_goth_pancake> banger alert Kreygasm
[0:39:50] <Nomad94> Rookie always gets the solemn parts
[0:40:02] <%stayinthepocket> IT'S DARE
[0:40:03] <Minerslovegames> Covie weapons finding their way onto the black market makes a ton of sense, actually.
[0:40:06] <jackelzxaa> rookie music
[0:40:06] <Heyestus> you can give marine grunts stuff like plasma rifles in halo 2. makes sense most folk can use them
[0:40:08] <Nomad94> Danganhalo: Finish the Thought
[0:40:10] <BritishTyrannosaur> their is an entire playlist of rookie levels but on legendary
[0:40:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Only Spartans can use most Covenant weapons
[0:40:33] <jackelzxaa> this music
[0:40:35] <Nomad94> love that piano
[0:40:42] <kikoeru_san> Wow Woolie REALLY got better at shooting, holy shit
[0:40:45] <+wunp_fxs> Theres a skull for that
[0:40:50] <rytisone> all they need is id safeguard
[0:40:57] <malcobraaklynny> even grunts wield their weapons one handed
[0:41:00] <%JohnAtDawn> Except they really didn't
[0:41:01] <RamenRiderZ> Welp, bit the bullet and ordered PS5, hopefully I'll get it either January or February NotLikeThis
[0:41:03] <Minerslovegames> Most of the covenant weapons are repurposed mining weapons, really.
[0:41:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:41:10] <%gnoame> Heresy to the Omissiah!
[0:41:12] <Halospaz117> I think the use of Human Weapons is also shunned in the Covenant
[0:41:20] <kikoeru_san> It is
[0:41:23] <+yhom_tork> brutes use shotguns tho
[0:41:24] <%ZeroCruz> All things considered the Rookie is definitely a cool guy
[0:41:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Haha Hunter go BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT
[0:41:33] <Halospaz117> Like it's not a hard rule, but you'll still get the side eye
[0:41:47] <xxshadowxx416> brute atr side units
[0:41:48] <BritishTyrannosaur> Brutes aren't bout the H O N O R tho
[0:41:51] <kikoeru_san> The Halo 2 manual is written from the Covi standpoint, they shit talk all the human guns
[0:41:57] <jackelzxaa> since we're console boys now they'll probably have zero problems with halo games going forward (4, 5, infinity)
[0:42:01] <razieltano123> "Even in death, I still serve the Omnissiah."
[0:42:02] <%DomunDomunDomun> Actual to scale needlers are nearly as big as a human torso. ODST makes them tiny, though.
[0:42:11] <+crunchygrl> im still holding out hope that woolie figures out how to kill hunters one day
[0:42:14] <andre11dr> Arbiter picks up human weapons and nobody says shit
[0:42:19] <%TheEpicTree> Hunters are way more scary when your an ODST
[0:42:20] <@Solidus_113> right shoulder
[0:42:24] <+JeluxDaCasual> hhhhhhhhhey!
[0:42:27] <rytisone> always hit the back
[0:42:28] <+yhom_tork> arbiter is woke
[0:42:29] <+JeluxDaCasual> Woolie did the thing!
[0:42:37] <Minerslovegames> I think prolonged use of covenant weapons can increase your chance of cancer, though. I think, at least. Can anyone clear that up?
[0:42:40] <+RahuHordika> Omg he learned
[0:42:40] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Woolie will never hit their back
[0:42:45] <subjectg> you can leapfrog hunters in later games
[0:42:49] <+yhom_tork> @ZoltanBMagnus LuL
[0:42:52] <%marrs_bars> their starboard shoulder, man!
[0:42:53] <%D00msDayDan> Finally putting it in terms he understands
[0:42:56] <Minerslovegames> Or is that just plasma grenades.
[0:42:58] <%ZeroCruz> Woolie still doesn’t know how to fight hunters woolieMIRIN
[0:43:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 4 GAMES LADS
[0:43:18] <RamenRiderZ> How does a pile of worms roar?
[0:43:20] <KapitanOrient> @WoolieVersus So youre telling me woolie went through the game solo and heroic and still hasnt learned not to shoot hunters from the front? lmao
[0:43:22] <thebalticguy1> 5 Games in Woolie will never know how to kill a hunter
[0:43:24] <%TheEpicTree> Worm Go: ARRRGGG
[0:43:24] <dinnydanny777> Why are the Covenant energy weapons so energy inefficient, you only get a few shots from a bunch of them limesHmm
[0:43:33] <andre11dr> How arw are those worms even making sounds ? They don't have glands

[0:43:34] <+Firemane1279> i like how Woolie shoots at everything but the back of the Hunter. LUL
[0:43:36] <subjectg> @ramenriderz dem vibrations
[0:43:38] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @RamenRiderZ they vibrate
[0:43:39] <BritishTyrannosaur> halo 5 hunbters are OP as fuck tho so i'm excited for that
[0:43:42] <+Penguin93> He'll figure it out in Halo 4 LUL
[0:43:43] <Halospaz117> NO SHIT
[0:44:01] <+yhom_tork> basically doom strats
[0:44:01] <Minerslovegames> @dinnydanny777 A lot of the reasoning for that is because Covenant weapons are really just repurposed mining tools.
[0:44:18] <Minerslovegames> Literally just Dead Space with their weapons.
[0:44:18] <%ZeroCruz> @penguin93 that’s bullshit but I want to believe it
[0:44:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Id be lying if i said i didn't want Woolie to experience Halo 5 LU:L
[0:44:30] <+yhom_tork> playing the new doom games made me much better at fps
[0:44:34] <dinnydanny777> @minerslovegames That might be true, but even the swords and gravity hammers have low charges limesHmm
[0:44:34] <Halospaz117> I was gonna say, the covenant are just an army of Isaac Clarkes in that case
[0:44:51] <dinnydanny777> Maybe the Covenant have really bad battery technology limesHmm
[0:45:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Man I really want a Dead Space Remake/Remaster
[0:45:13] <%KiboSenshi> I dont think they will play Halo 5. There's no couch coop if im not mistaken, and it'll probably never come to mcc
[0:45:14] <%TheEpicTree> God Gamer Woolie
[0:45:18] <%D00msDayDan> Wow so V isn’t even playing as rookie
[0:45:19] <+yhom_tork> dead space remake PogChamp
[0:45:21] <Minerslovegames> @dinnydanny777 Gravity hammers and energy swords are weapons of the brutes' and elites' culture, respectively. But I get what you mean, yeah.
[0:45:23] <ralphfromdk> Has he learned how ammo counters work though? LUL
[0:45:26] <andre11dr> Im actually looking forward to Halo 5 just because i never played it
[0:45:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It'd bad
[0:45:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> *it's
[0:45:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Its bad but it should still be experinced
[0:45:50] <ashenchevalierthesecond> I have them on PC, but a remaster of Dead Space 1 + 2 for next gen consoles would be preeeeeeetty good
[0:45:51] <%KiboSenshi> there were some cool set pieces
[0:45:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Exactly
[0:46:00] <BritishTyrannosaur> 5 is good for what it is. some cool levels too
[0:46:02] <+yhom_tork> halo 5 isnt that bad
[0:46:15] <malcobraaklynny> Halo 5 is great for custom games
[0:46:18] <Hammerknife> whoa since when did woolie play FPS games
[0:46:19] <BritishTyrannosaur> Like the first blue team level has a cool vibe
[0:46:20] <Minerslovegames> The only good thing from the Halo 5 story is that one Monitor/Oracle who's a geeky girl.
[0:46:20] <%KiboSenshi> tru
[0:46:29] <f0rgeman> yeesh
[0:46:33] <subjectg> A little practice goes a long way
[0:46:34] <%ZeroCruz> Or we can pretend it doesn’t exist
[0:46:34] <%stayinthepocket> I can't believe neither of them died in that encounter
[0:46:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DA BOIS ARE BACK PogChamp
[0:46:37] <Nomad94> Ebulient Prism is a delight
[0:46:44] <Nomad94> Beep
[0:46:46] <PrideOfFiddles> Yea switch out the weapon with ammo SeemsGood great idea
[0:46:48] <malcobraaklynny> SourPls
[0:46:49] <RamenRiderZ> NotLikeThis
[0:46:50] <andre11dr> 4 is actually fine,not as good as things before but it's fine, looked really impressive at the time
[0:46:51] <%KiboSenshi> halo 5 just lacked a story that was on par with the other titles
[0:46:54] <dinnydanny777> The only thing I know about Halo 5 is a cutscene I got recommended to me that looked really awkward
[0:46:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Halo 5 sucks and 343 is trying their best to ignore it ever happened. Locke ain't no Nero.
[0:47:03] <%KiboSenshi> i thought 4 was great campaign wise
[0:47:09] <Nomad94> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Opinion ignored, blocked.
[0:47:10] <Minerslovegames> Yeah. Halo 5 had the weakest story.
[0:47:11] <+yhom_tork> 4 was good
[0:47:12] <f0rgeman> HE WAS LLOKING RIGHT AT IT
[0:47:12] <rytisone> hunt down ninja turtles
[0:47:17] <%TheEpicTree> Literally looked at the beacon
[0:47:25] <+FateNero> Halo 4 multiplayer was actually good
[0:47:25] <dinnydanny777> I think 4 possibly has the best opening of any Halo game
[0:47:34] <+FateNero> The campaign was kinda boring
[0:47:35] <malcobraaklynny> good luck burning your fingers
[0:47:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Why are you booing me? I'm right
[0:47:38] <kikoeru_san> "where do we go" idk man maybe the door with the big arrow pointing to it
[0:47:41] <Minerslovegames> And I know a lot of people don't care for Halo 4 but I agree with @KiboSenshi . I think it had the best story and emotional payoff of the all the games.
[0:47:42] <+vaderxyz1970> Fingerless gloves ouch
[0:47:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Its a metal coil too ouch
[0:47:58] <%stayinthepocket> 4 and 5 have opposite problems. 4 nice campaign bad multi. 5 bad campaign good multi.
[0:47:59] <andre11dr> They have gloves, it's fine
[0:48:04] <+Firemane1279> @nomad94 he's objectively right though. LUL
[0:48:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:48:07] <+condemned_15> He got SAX on the brain
[0:48:10] <kikoeru_san> The turbo flub
[0:48:11] <+UallasDrgn> Fingerless gloves
[0:48:14] <%KiboSenshi> @Minerslovegames Yeah the emotional side of the story really did a lot for me
[0:48:15] <Nomad94> @Firemane1279 No.
[0:48:15] <%TheEpicTree> Finishing The Fight!!
[0:48:19] <+UallasDrgn> He gonna have zero skin on his fingers lol
[0:48:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Minerslovegames Oh i agree. Too bad 5 completely negates the ending
[0:48:22] <BritishTyrannosaur> eyyyyyy
[0:48:24] <%D00msDayDan> That’s what the fingerless gloves are for
[0:48:36] <Bigyanno> I'm really really happy Woolie got to play at least some of the game solo cos ODST really benefits from solo playthroughs
[0:48:48] <%KiboSenshi> @Minerslovegames really hoping they somehow retcon it in infinte lol
[0:48:53] <jackelzxaa> blessing in disguise
[0:48:55] <+Firemane1279> @nomad94 live in bliss, I suppose. MindManners
[0:48:59] <subjectg> if only he recorded his solo gameplay, that would’ve been neao
[0:49:00] <+yhom_tork> hope they get the flamethrower
[0:49:02] <subjectg> *neato
[0:49:05] <Nomad94> @Firemane1279 Okay, you don't get to be condescending.
[0:49:26] <+Firemane1279> @nomad94 you blocked someone for an opinion. you first.
[0:49:29] <Nomad94> Munchy
[0:49:32] <Bigyanno> This is one of my favourite levels to gameplay-wise, though certainly not aesthetic-wise
[0:49:34] <BritishTyrannosaur> he got X-boned
[0:49:36] <idiotscampaign> plenty of shotgun ammo on this level
[0:49:39] <Minerslovegames> Yeah it looks like they might be retconning it in Infinite @KiboSenshi .
[0:49:41] <andre11dr> The one think about games after this is that i can't remember a single song
[0:49:42] <rytisone> just ragdol into the sky
[0:49:45] <nxflre> Theres a slightly alt cutscene and a bonus interaction if you have all audio recordings up to this point
[0:49:50] <%Mr_Strut> Or leave a really entertaining corpse
[0:49:54] <kikoeru_san> "Fancy spit huts"
[0:49:55] <%ZeroCruz> Solo soldier man that learns to git gud through the bullshit is my favorite
[0:49:57] <malcobraaklynny> I liked the direction 343 went in Halo 4 with exploring Master Chief and Cortana's relationship
[0:49:57] <%KiboSenshi> @Minerslovegames lets hope
[0:49:58] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus i wish we had canned death animations iirl
[0:50:03] <%D00msDayDan> @woolieversus shotgun effective range drops off past melee lunge range
[0:50:05] <%twilight_cleric> twilight_cleric subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Woooooooooo
[0:50:08] <Halospaz117> I'm curious how long canonically is the entirety of Mombasa Streets supposed to be? Because I'm wondering if it's possible for that last mission of Buck's to actually be happening while you're wandering around?
[0:50:08] <+vaderxyz1970> You should say something else is my favorite bender comback
[0:50:09] <Chatterbox1991> ala Max Payne 1
[0:50:15] <Minerslovegames> I don't MIND the Halo 5 story and I think it COULD have worked. But the execution was terrible.
[0:50:26] <Babbott_Orion> MONSTER
[0:50:47] <%TheEpicTree> Killing Kids
[0:50:49] <%KiboSenshi> @Minerslovegames I can agree with that. I hope they dont just throw characters away from it in infinite
[0:50:58] <Minerslovegames> Agree
[0:51:11] <kikoeru_san> Woolie is ending ODST on a high note: shotgunning children
[0:51:25] <+mr_pl0w> Yakuza has entered the chat
[0:51:26] <Bigyanno> Viscerable is a good word. It's a way of expressing particularly gruesome misery

[0:55:52] <%TheEpicTree> kill him
[0:55:54] <Dave_VD> It reflects that his experience as V affects his perspective now
[0:55:54] <malcobraaklynny> @Halospaz117 Kikowani Station is 5 hours after drop, so the Rookie probably *just* missed Buck

[0:56:17] <Babbott_Orion> sniper is for every situation
[0:56:20] <Minerslovegames> I like that the game shows the whole gamut of officers. From guys just doing their job and trying to help, to fully corrupt and selfish bastards.
[0:56:22] <Bigyanno> Carbines are the best gun for buggers I've found
[0:56:24] <IAMEVILORD> Speaking on this games Vergil. Halo Vergil is best AI. Hes as snarky as Cortana despite his limited ability to express himself!
[0:56:59] <Minerslovegames> My friend and I used to call the beam rifle the "fly-swatter" because it would one-shot drones.
[0:56:59] <malcobraaklynny> is it because you're too short?
[0:57:31] <Bigyanno> I'm so happy that drones can be headshoted after Halo 2
[0:57:35] <+shadowassassin887> you ever just barrel stuff a brute with a beam riffle? no just me?
[0:57:37] <RickSaintRiot> Vergil's very funny. It does rather feel like a real person on the other end who only has access to a utilitarian soundboard.
[0:57:56] <RamenRiderZ> Baby Shotgun
[0:58:12] <Minerslovegames> Real talk this cop's survived like, what, two days in a covenant-infested city.
[0:58:21] <RickSaintRiot> Vergil the prank caller
[0:58:26] <Babbott_Orion> aaaaaaaaugh

[0:58:36] <+yhom_tork> this gun kicks ass
[0:58:47] <trackles_64> That guy was going for a brute
[0:58:47] <%ZeroCruz> Vergil is a good boy
[0:58:47] <IAMEVILORD> Vergil bears the burden of trying to be sarcastic through a computer. As people on the Internet we must respect his commitment to sarcasm
[0:59:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:59:02] <%TheEpicTree> You killed that child good woolie
[0:59:03] <Bigyanno> Did the mauler come before the brutes encountered shotguns or did the brutes see shotguns and go "Oh shit we gotta make us one of those"?
[0:59:03] <+kewlmyc> At least we can do the rest of the Halo games now since this is the Xbone versions.
[0:59:07] <razieltano123> Vergil is one sassy City A.I.
[0:59:07] <%DukeAtomic> Vergil is a good AI, best friend
[0:59:14] <@Solidus_113> Woolie just shot V in the back of the head
[0:59:14] <Halospaz117> Did Woolie shoot V in the back of the head?
[0:59:23] <Halospaz117> Jinx
[0:59:32] <%ZeroCruz> Vergil comes in the shape of a friend
[0:59:42] <Minerslovegames> I really like how Vergil can only use the sound bites available to him. "Warning, road work ahead", "detour right.". It's so simple but it adds a lot of personality to him.
[0:59:52] <Babbott_Orion> DansGame
[0:59:53] <%TheEpicTree> he's a bit sus
[0:59:54] <+yhom_tork> they should recruit him

[1:00:42] <%Dean_Inbetween> Been having a few days
[1:00:47] <IAMEVILORD> Vergil would have thrown the cop into the airlock by now considering his comments
[1:00:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> Few bad days*

[1:01:51] <SentientHoodie> WIRES? In uuuuuuuuuuuuh ADMIN?
[1:01:53] <IAMEVILORD> Vergil is such a snarky Asshole
[1:01:54] <subjectg> good citizens do their part
[1:01:55] <%TheEpicTree> He Had Big Back Story
[1:01:56] <$RunningNGunning> Bad end
[1:01:56] <Heyestus> rest in beast
[1:02:03] <RickSaintRiot> What, really, he survives with all audio??
[1:02:04] <Minerslovegames> If you get all the audio logs he'll jump down with you.
[1:02:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice stick
[1:02:07] <RickSaintRiot> Never knew that
[1:02:07] <Bigyanno> I always got the audio logs before this
[1:02:13] <Depthcharge2030> damn nice throw
[1:02:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:02:14] <%Dean_Inbetween> There was going to be a guardian bossfight in halo 3
[1:02:15] <JaceDarkstar> ha you get what you deserve
[1:02:27] <Bigyanno> He's not a nice person if he lives btw
[1:02:29] <%DukeAtomic> @ricksaintriot yep with the audio logs this mission changes
[1:02:46] <subjectg> sublevel 9, all icy, should ring a few bells
[1:02:46] <jackelzxaa> When's V going to do a remix of Baby Shark Dodododododo?
[1:02:49] <IAMEVILORD> Vergil hates asshole cops.
[1:02:55] <Minerslovegames> But he's actually corrupt and trying to cover for the dirty cops in the NMPD.
[1:02:56] <%DukeAtomic> there's different cutscenes (some more different than others)
[1:03:10] <ralphfromdk> subjectg Would you say that it's..... sub zero LUL
[1:03:18] <subjectg> damn at this point legendary might be more appropriate
[1:03:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> walks into fire LUL
[1:03:21] <%Theycallmenerf> Oh hey this part!
[1:03:23] <Depthcharge2030> woolie is making some nice throws
[1:03:23] <RickSaintRiot> a little weird that he's a white cop in New Mombasa, but i guess it's not that weird.
[1:03:33] <Minerslovegames> He tries to kill you as well and then you have to put him down.
[1:03:34] <Babbott_Orion> pogonaSad
[1:03:36] <%BisoromiBear> MLG Woolie
[1:03:39] <%DukeAtomic> mfw they don't know why it's frozen
[1:03:39] <%Theycallmenerf> YO COUCH CO-OP
[1:03:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Its cool
[1:03:41] <Halospaz117> This room isn't supposed to be this cold normally
[1:03:45] <rytisone> just like Vega
[1:03:47] <malcobraaklynny> looks pretty cold
[1:03:50] <RickSaintRiot> never read the novels, so idk the political sitch in Halo
[1:03:50] <Babbott_Orion> pogonaSad pogonaSad
[1:03:51] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its 2500 years in the future africa is probably doing a lot better and getting immagration
[1:03:55] <thebalticguy1> This is audio log stuff
[1:04:05] <%Dean_Inbetween> Hence white cop
[1:04:07] <xxshadowxx416> dint get abuio l9gs
[1:04:08] <%JohnAtDawn> Probably should have watched them BEFORE this
[1:04:08] <Babbott_Orion> FBUCK
[1:04:10] <trackles_64> Finally an audio log
[1:04:12] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween it's 2552, not 5225
[1:04:13] <ralphfromdk> RickSaintRiot To be fair, it's hella far in the future, we literaly are out colonizing other planets... Earth has got to be all mixed up now
[1:04:20] <idiotscampaign> so close
[1:04:23] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic SeriousSloth
[1:04:26] <%TheEpicTree> Doesn't even try to radio back
[1:04:26] <Minerslovegames> @RickSaintRiot New Mombasa seems pretty diversified by 2552, to be fair.
[1:04:29] <%stayinthepocket> It's going up. It's coming up. It's coming up. It's Dare.
[1:04:38] <subjectg> eeet daaaeh
[1:04:39] <RickSaintRiot> Yeah, I guess I'm not thinking of it far enough in the future.
[1:04:50] <%KiboSenshi> @stayinthepocket nice
[1:04:52] <ralphfromdk> So Woolie has something against red ones, eh?
[1:05:07] <%DukeAtomic> @stayinthepocket *elite death grunt*
[1:05:07] <%Dean_Inbetween> Earth is probably very homogeneous mixed around
[1:05:21] <RamenRiderZ> If its red make it dead
[1:05:25] <RickSaintRiot> the NMPD hires white cops as a diversity hire, lol
[1:05:27] <ralphfromdk> Look at him reloading like a big boy LUL
[1:05:27] <%ZeroCruz> Red is cooler than green damnit
[1:05:29] <razieltano123> Vergil is a good boy.
[1:05:34] <JaceDarkstar> if you fall for a girl, make sure she's got balls
[1:05:34] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween Yeah it is I was just like correcting the timeframe
[1:05:40] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic im not good at math
[1:05:45] <derap41> Wow ouch

[1:05:48] <%Dean_Inbetween> I typed before i thought

[1:05:49] <Babbott_Orion> no name
[1:05:50] <trackles_64> its ROOKIE
[1:05:51] <RickSaintRiot> OH he has O+ on his arm
[1:05:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That trigger discipline... good
[1:06:02] <RickSaintRiot> nice, Rookie's blood type
[1:06:04] <+condemned_15> He's the Sax Man
[1:06:06] <RamenRiderZ> I am the sleepy boy
[1:06:07] <%DukeAtomic> haha i wonder who did that
[1:06:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> I don’t do talking
[1:06:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SHIKA SHIKA SLIM SHADY
[1:06:17] <%Dean_Inbetween> Oh that japanese will remember that
[1:06:23] <Heyestus> would the real Rookie please stand up?
[1:06:26] <%Dean_Inbetween> O+ 👀👀👀
[1:06:29] <Halospaz117> AIs know shit man

[1:06:32] <%alpacasintophats> alpacasintophats subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! yo 9 months! just got here now, that weird glitch you guys were getting still a thing?
[1:06:39] <Tuna_Can_0> not even O negative smh my head
[1:06:40] <derap41> No need to be a bitch about it lady
[1:06:44] <%hattrick61> whu oh
[1:06:50] <RickSaintRiot> was gonna say, wonder why they didn't make it O- universal donor
[1:06:51] <RamenRiderZ> 1v1
[1:06:52] <%Dean_Inbetween> Im having a bad day im typing horribly
[1:06:52] <%DukeAtomic> Rookie speaks for the first time: "I peed in there"
[1:06:53] <%JetpackMcQuack> AI carried us through this war
[1:06:57] <nxflre> yeah unconscious for 6 hrs
[1:07:07] <ralphfromdk> Well, there was this one cop who was pretty okay....
[1:07:08] <Halospaz117> Look, she's ONI, at least a little Assholery is needed
[1:07:11] <Ynkubus_> All rookie wanted was to nap
[1:07:15] <RickSaintRiot> some kinda bloodtype metaphor
[1:07:20] <%alpacasintophats> oh I guess you're doing console since split screen
[1:07:24] <%alpacasintophats> nvm then
[1:07:35] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yeah human ais are much better than covenant AI because apparently they know the dangers of mass effect
[1:07:37] <Babbott_Orion> NEEEEEGH
[1:07:59] <Minerslovegames> You should trust ONI operatives for as long as is convenient.
[1:08:03] <+yhom_tork> everybody calls them buggers
[1:08:06] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween They make them smarter but that means that you have to put them down, it's like owning a pet that's really good at math
[1:08:37] <idiotscampaign> there's something righteous about a regular ass human decking an alien invader in the face
[1:08:45] <RickSaintRiot> welcome to erf
[1:08:57] <Halospaz117> EDI likes us!
[1:09:02] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic im kinda sad halo tried dabbling with that plot thread because i find it incredibly tiresome at this point
[1:09:03] <%ZeroCruz> Careful Buck
[1:09:05] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Rookie about NTR Buck?
[1:09:11] <RamenRiderZ> Woolie's solo run was the hyperbolic time chamber moment
[1:09:14] <Babbott_Orion> AAAGH
[1:09:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:09:15] <Bigyanno> Legendary eventually boils down to "do I have a plasma pistol and a weapon that can headshot enemies and if not can I get them?"
[1:09:17] <rytisone> break your legs trooper
[1:09:19] <phantalime> AAGH
[1:09:19] <Tuna_Can_0> AHH WutFace
[1:09:19] <+JeluxDaCasual> Six of 12
[1:09:22] <Nomad94> AAAGH
[1:09:23] <+JeluxDaCasual> Battlestar
[1:09:30] <ralphfromdk> Friendship with Buck ended, Mute Rookie is my new best friend.
[1:09:31] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween It doesn't come up much in the mainline games, and as far as I'm concerned, that's basically all the canon I care about
[1:09:48] <RickSaintRiot> Jimmy "Third Wheel" Rookie
[1:10:02] <Halospaz117> I mean, he is a Lance Corporal
[1:10:12] <+yhom_tork> rookie aint playin no games
[1:10:16] <Halospaz117> He technically outranks Mickey, who's a Private First Class
[1:10:17] <%DukeAtomic> Extended universe stuff will always be like "loosely canon until mentioned in the game somewhere" basically
[1:10:19] <rytisone> A Rookie with protagonist powers
[1:10:22] <RickSaintRiot> Rookie Tightlips
[1:10:28] <Minerslovegames> @Bigyanno It's always funny to me that the most ignored weapon on other difficulties becomes the best on Legendary."
[1:10:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> Naw just enlisted last week
[1:10:34] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[1:10:35] <Halospaz117> He's really only a Rookie in terms of his current squad
[1:10:42] <+yhom_tork> she is oni after all
[1:10:43] <%DukeAtomic> @Halospaz117 Let's face it, we, the players, are more of a character than Mickey is
[1:10:44] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic well 5 and apparently it’s supplemental material were pushing that and they’ve been building towards that since reach with the ai commitee so the real answer is until 343 forces it down our throats
[1:10:49] <RickSaintRiot> "where'd they hit ya?" "..."
[1:10:51] <Buddha0991> worst firefight map
[1:10:54] <Depthcharge2030> brute owed her money
[1:10:55] <Nomad94> I hate this map
[1:10:59] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic thankfully infinite seems to be going in annother direction
[1:11:00] <razieltano123> The Rookie outranks Mikey in rank for God sake.
[1:11:03] <%stayinthepocket> Worst firefight map right here
[1:11:04] <subjectg> chasm 10 ain’t too bad
[1:11:07] <Saffry_Ruzin> The Rookie does have Initials, which are JD, but that's all that's really known about him
[1:11:07] <%alpacasintophats> @Buddha0991 BEST firefight map
[1:11:13] <subjectg> i think crater’s worse honestly
[1:11:23] <ralphfromdk> Christ, the aliens have been here for 1 day, and they already got Hives growing.
[1:11:24] <+GruntOfAction> This area is a firefight map yes
[1:11:28] <JaceDarkstar> this is the fire fight map that got me endure
[1:11:29] <%alpacasintophats> yep
[1:11:30] <RickSaintRiot> it stands for James Dean
[1:11:31] <RamenRiderZ> inb4 Rookie comes from Rook
[1:11:38] <%TheEpicTree> Scary thing is that those bugs have only been here a day, and they've already made this big ass hive.
[1:11:45] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween In Halo Wars 2 they flat out deal with the AI problem right away, it goes actually swimmingly and the way it's supposed to go. The entire game is then about Super Brutes and kind of kicks ass, narratively from what I've played so far. The villain is cool as FUCK
[1:11:51] <Halospaz117> Nah clearly it's John Doe, he takes off the helmet and it's just Big Boss underneath
[1:11:53] <trackles_64> Libary with all the fake walls
[1:12:00] <Minerslovegames> @TheEpicTree Tyranid vibes.
[1:12:02] <Torivore> It stands for John Dalo
[1:12:16] <RickSaintRiot> John Dalo, you mind telling me what the hell you're doing as an ODST
[1:12:23] <RickSaintRiot> "Sir, keeping you waiting, huh."
[1:12:24] <+Smithyr> Is this the 360 version to avoid crashes in the PC MCC?
[1:12:34] <Halospaz117> XBONE version
[1:12:39] <subjectg> never noticed this ambient track here, it’s nice
[1:12:42] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic the gravemind already brought up the ideas of end game consequentialist ethics, making it about synthetics versus organics is kind of besides the point now and the whole mendicant thing
[1:12:44] <%stayinthepocket> Antenna Cradle
[1:12:45] <%DukeAtomic> I'm pretty sure also by the way, that these hives aren't necessarily like, breeding grounds. The Drones aren't like gross feral things, they think and actually have tactics. These might actually be like weird workspaces
[1:12:46] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic really?
[1:12:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> Cool
[1:12:56] <%alpacasintophats> @Smithyr Xbone but yeah
[1:12:57] <%Dean_Inbetween> Thats good to know
[1:13:04] <DaisyFannn> Bunker 1
[1:13:06] <RickSaintRiot> Mendicant. Mendicouldnt. Mendiwouldnever!
[1:13:08] <trackles_64> Proximinity mines only
[1:13:10] <Babbott_Orion> LUL
[1:13:17] <razieltano123> Ala akbar.
[1:13:29] <+Smithyr> @alpacasintophats makes sense. Good way to circumnavigate the problem
[1:13:32] <%stayinthepocket> Antenna Cradle has such a banging tune
[1:13:41] <+GruntOfAction> You can do that in Risk of Rain 2 by sticking engineer mines on your teammates lol

[1:13:54] <+bigdrifter> thats my strategy in battlefield, jihad jeeps ftw

[1:14:18] <Jmann1892> LUL
[1:14:34] <Minerslovegames> Drones are pretty weak to begin with.
[1:14:38] <sniffy77> Carbine slaughters anything in this game
[1:14:42] <+RahuHordika> Did he just walk past a drone
[1:14:47] <Bigyanno> I will take OP over the bullshit that they were in older Halos
[1:14:53] <RickSaintRiot> "way back in the 21st century, a madman stole the Declaration of Independence. things changed after that"
[1:14:57] <Bigyanno> fuck drones
[1:15:12] <Nomad94> Was that Lorithia?
[1:15:13] <trackles_64> Brute Chieftans are the worst on solo
[1:15:17] <Nomad94> You'll pay for your insolence
[1:15:18] <Gelphaze> That drone had a shield!

[1:17:07] <Halospaz117> Rookie's fucking JACKED
[1:17:10] <Bigyanno> I always take a sniper rifle with me for that encounter
[1:17:10] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween I uh think that they just ignore 5, but I don't remember when it takes place. I haven't gotten that far in it
[1:17:12] <Babbott_Orion> PogChamp
[1:17:21] <%stayinthepocket> @yeeter_baelish Another playoff another chokejob

[1:17:43] <Nomad94> Should have asked Justin Case
[1:17:49] <Babbott_Orion> I love how different this scene plays when you get all logs
[1:17:52] <subjectg> What’s your vector, Clarence?
[1:17:52] <Halospaz117> Yeah, Chief and Cortana just left poor Dustin out floating by Halo

[1:18:22] <DianaTheAscian> good job woolie
[1:18:24] <%DukeAtomic> @Dean_Inbetween mfw they add infinite to the mcc but not 5
[1:18:24] <Buddha0991> they specifically said they will follow up on halo 5
[1:18:26] <Minerslovegames> friend

[1:19:31] <Torivore> Did Woolie ever shoot one himself?
[1:19:33] <%DukeAtomic> She doesn't have time to explain why she doesn't have time to explain.
[1:19:33] <DigitalJoshie> @Nomad94 0
[1:19:33] <malcobraaklynny> but what if a Brute is pink?
[1:19:35] <andre11dr> This lady is a little too much into that tentacled alien
[1:19:37] <trackles_64> Undersdtand my english
[1:19:39] <Babbott_Orion> LUL
[1:19:43] <%Dean_Inbetween> @dukeatomic they probably wont add 5 because it will make the collection more bloated in size, they probably will just put it separately on steam
[1:19:46] <Bigyanno> It has a fucking :3 face
[1:19:46] <RamenRiderZ> Give the doggie a gun
[1:19:47] <%jinking79> Quan Chi the head

[1:20:58] <RickSaintRiot> yeah like "oh you're a slave? i guess i'll die, go ahead and kill me i gotta be fair :)"
[1:21:04] <%Dean_Inbetween> The vortigaunts are straight up slaves though at least the covenant are allowed to keep there culture and have some part of the society
[1:21:11] <Nomad94> *their
[1:21:17] <%Dean_Inbetween> The vortigaunts have it so much worse

[1:21:44] <Bigyanno> you can melee those bugs stealthily
[1:21:52] <Halospaz117> I've had Buck walk into this room and start blasting

[1:22:20] <@Solidus_113> fucking Buck
[1:22:20] <%Dean_Inbetween> But that might just be to the primitive nature of xen and the nihilanths domain
[1:22:21] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[1:22:22] <%alpacasintophats> you could also just kill them completely silently
[1:22:24] <Nomad94> LUL
[1:22:28] <Halospaz117> "I DON'T LIKE BUGS!"
[1:22:35] <subjectg> MANY WHELPS

[1:23:41] <+yhom_tork> Pepega
[1:23:46] <%Dean_Inbetween> I don’t believe drones are entirely slaves i think the covenant coopted there leaders and because of the drones ant mentality they just listen without question
[1:23:46] <Nomad94> Thanks Buck
[1:23:50] <DigitalJoshie> nice;y done buck
[1:23:51] <Nomad94> *their
[1:23:52] <StebTheVee> Maybe you should've told them the mission clear, Dare
[1:23:53] <%alpacasintophats> this is *not* a stealth mission
[1:23:54] <dot_theory> Buck does use that hard R when he talks about the bugs, though.
[1:23:54] <@Solidus_113> 4Head

[1:24:23] <RamenRiderZ> Techs not here yet
[1:24:31] <Bigyanno> Does the rookie make it past the war?
[1:24:32] <Heyestus> siguorney weaver does not approve
[1:24:43] <%Dean_Inbetween> @tuna_can_0 but that’s the combine, and the combine are like a million times larger than the covenant and we literally know nothing about there leadership or other parts of there alliance
[1:24:43] <%fritz_dacat> Buck can't leave a room without an explosion.
[1:24:48] <Jmann1892> @Bigyanno Yes

[1:31:42] <phantalime> for the love of buck
[1:31:42] <DigitalJoshie> man I love buck
[1:31:47] <ThatGuyThere03> This is exactly the amount of unprofessional behavior I would expect from a special forces unit. I am not joking.
[1:31:50] <+FateNero> Buck is suffering in this level
[1:31:58] <%Dean_Inbetween> This feels like a story way before 2010 with the tropes in this story
[1:32:02] <Bigyanno> Buck is the actual worst in this level
[1:32:13] <rytisone> not so fast or furious
[1:32:14] <%liphttam1> Wait they can die?
[1:32:15] <RickSaintRiot> spec ops more like... joc streps
[1:32:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She said...
[1:32:24] <%SilverDevilfish> Oh hey it's the Deathtrap variant of the Hog
[1:32:30] <Halospaz117> I just realized, Woolie has no context for what an Elephant is in this series, huh?
[1:32:31] <subjectg> if anything special ops get way more leeway in how they conduct themselves
[1:32:37] <+yhom_tork> cursed halo when?
[1:32:54] <%alpacasintophats> shut your face, the transport hog is the best
[1:32:56] <andre11dr> Cursed Halo is actually godlike
[1:33:04] <ThatGuyThere03> @subjectg They're kinda rolling that back after tons of units got into deep shit for constant bad behavior
[1:33:04] <RickSaintRiot> sounds like a Lovecraft version
[1:33:05] <%alpacasintophats> especially when you have four people in it at once
[1:33:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> InfernoPlus is a god
[1:33:11] <RickSaintRiot> That Most Accursed Halo
[1:33:17] <rytisone> 20/20 vision
[1:33:24] <%Dean_Inbetween> The transport hog can be the best hog if you give your marines nothing but fuel rods in that one halo 3 level
[1:33:25] <+Penguin93> damn if only the tv could move
[1:33:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> driving is super easy tho

[1:34:00] <%D00msDayDan> Vindicated in his bad decision to start too far from his damn tv
[1:34:07] <RamenRiderZ> He's doing his best
[1:34:11] <Torivore> Woolie still has his inhibitor engaged
[1:34:25] <%faeron93> Flashbacks to AH doing the LASO run and taking two parts to do the finale

[1:39:54] <RickSaintRiot> huh, OK
[1:40:05] <andre11dr> This song reminds me of Tekken for some reason

[1:43:41] <IndoorSitup> Guys, make sure to tell Woolie to look away from the screen once the loading screen for the next "mission"starts. It spoils stuff a bit.

[1:45:13] <+yhom_tork> damn xenos DansGame
[1:45:25] <%Lion_kun> How much game is left?
[1:45:30] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Make sure to look away from the screen once this mission ends cause the loading screen after it shows some spoilers.
[1:45:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Take the off ramp
[1:45:39] <%hattrick61> @lion_kun p like 10 minutes
[1:45:43] <%Dean_Inbetween> This is the last level I believe
[1:45:51] <%Lion_kun> Haha
[1:45:51] <%stayinthepocket> @lion_kun Nearly done
[1:45:53] <RickSaintRiot> there are people who suffer from less task-switch-brain-lag or whatever, but probably almost no one who has Zero brainlag.
[1:45:54] <+smikeye> dang at the end already
[1:45:59] <+yhom_tork> cool onramp
[1:46:08] <+smikeye> does woolie only have a launch xbone? no xbonx?
[1:46:16] <stormhawk9891> Oh hey best Firefight map
[1:46:20] <%TheEpicTree> "Go with Buck" already gone
[1:46:26] <%stayinthepocket> This is a good firefight map
[1:46:35] <%hattrick61> Back to the zoo
[1:46:40] <subjectg> last exit is apparently based of a marathon map
[1:46:41] <+yhom_tork> this brings back memories
[1:46:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @smikeye Woolis doesnt believe later editions are better
[1:46:45] <phantalime> qualoty zebra
[1:47:03] <trackles_64> Horede mode
[1:47:05] <%Dean_Inbetween> There was a dead zebra early on in the reserve
[1:47:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He's right, they're not worth the cost
[1:47:16] <RamenRiderZ> Looks like you are going to have a firefight Kappa
[1:47:18] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Look away from the screen once this mission ends cause it has a spoilery loading screen once it ends
[1:47:22] <+yhom_tork> vergil needs more power
[1:47:25] <subjectg> “Hey you! Go play some Firefight after this!”
[1:47:28] <+smikeye> @smikeye well that kind of grave misunderstanding isn't a surprise
[1:47:28] <AppleBerryKitty> or give it to the npcs for unlimited ammo
[1:47:33] <sniffy77> yes
[1:47:37] <%Dean_Inbetween> This melody sounds like perfect darks leitmotif
[1:47:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He's learning not to snipe Grunts!
[1:47:38] <RickSaintRiot> always reuse maps
[1:47:39] <idiotscampaign> top floor gives you a good vantage point
[1:47:41] <%stayinthepocket> FIREFIGHT
[1:47:44] <Ipsenscastle> If the launch works, I don't get why anyone would upgrade unless they have more money than they know what to do with
[1:47:47] <%Dean_Inbetween> Ye
[1:47:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> It is
[1:47:59] <Jashter18> Yep this is a Firefight map
[1:48:04] <Draco_Renegade> It is
[1:48:05] <lucky_icarus> wow, I see Woolie has got priority targeting down. not wasting that sniper ammo on grunts and such.
[1:48:11] <+smikeye> because a lot of early games that had unlocked framerates run and look better
[1:48:25] <IndoorSitup> Does Little V know to tell Woolie to look away from the screen once this mission ends??
[1:48:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Turret on top floor btw
[1:48:28] <+yhom_tork> woolie has actually gotten much better
[1:48:34] <%TheEpicTree> Super Warrior Woolie
[1:48:39] <shadowcrisis> @WoolieVersus where is Reggie Jackson and Yao Mihn?
[1:48:48] <RamenRiderZ> original ODST firefight didnt have a matchmaking so I soloed the score achievements NotLikeThis
[1:49:00] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yes you can
[1:49:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its just annoying
[1:49:16] <subjectg> @ramenriderz same, crater sucked for that

[1:49:47] <%stayinthepocket> Worth
[1:49:50] <%Dean_Inbetween> :v
[1:49:58] <RickSaintRiot> Don't draw his attention until you have a clear shot
[1:50:03] <%ZeroCruz> You can also give the big gun to buck
[1:50:24] <%hattrick61> clear backblast
[1:50:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THEY FLY NOW?

[1:50:31] <FerwhateverDota> that brute catcheed the mortar LUL
[1:50:40] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Wait did those Brutes just get caught with their own shot? lmaoooooo
[1:50:41] <DigitalJoshie> @BallerSwagBro9k they did before
[1:50:44] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Woolz, make sure to look away from the screen when this mission ends.
[1:50:58] <RickSaintRiot> love a good teamkill... on the other side
[1:50:59] <sniffy77> FINAL BOSS
[1:51:03] <$RunningNGunning> This is just a sneak peek of Halo's Horde mode, as was the style at the time
[1:51:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @BallerSwagBro9k I .....i know NotLikeThis
[1:51:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @IndoorSitup Uh, why? He's played Halo 3 already.
[1:51:38] <subjectg> it’s more of a gazebo than a pagoda
[1:51:39] <dinnydanny777> That piano tho
[1:51:39] <RamenRiderZ> That brute just wasted his shield
[1:51:41] <Nomad94> SourPls
[1:51:41] <+yhom_tork> gow horde was the best, but firefight is very close

[1:51:48] <RickSaintRiot> special cosmetic unlock: onion on the belt
[1:51:49] <%TheEpicTree> Oh Shit It's Dem Boys
[1:51:51] <+smikeye> since he's on xbone (no idea why he wasn't using it from the start w/ it's splitscreen) he can go right into Halo 4
[1:51:56] <IndoorSitup> @canadiananimatorguy It still spoils stuff a bit, the loading screen I mean
[1:51:56] <%Dean_Inbetween> I think woolie got good at the game because he had to replay it and wasn’t held back by being on stream
[1:52:11] <RickSaintRiot> not enough trellises to be an arbor, certainly
[1:52:14] <RickSaintRiot> much less a promenade
[1:52:15] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Look away from the loading screen.
[1:52:17] <$RunningNGunning> Platforming god PogChamp
[1:52:31] <Nomad94> gg!
[1:52:31] <+getinthetent> aw darn I haven't played Halo 4 yet NotLikeThis

[1:52:44] <+yhom_tork> monkaS
[1:52:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[1:52:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It doesn't spoil Halo 4 at all
[1:52:49] <@Solidus_113> time to glass
[1:52:50] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Look away from the loading screen cause it has small spoils
[1:52:57] <@Solidus_113> @IndoorSitup he saw it
[1:52:57] <malcobraaklynny> @smikeye they were playing on separate PC's before; only doing xbox now because it crashed
[1:53:07] <RamenRiderZ> SCARY SHIP
[1:53:10] <rytisone> the sax
[1:53:15] <dinnydanny777> Ah yeah, saxy time
[1:53:17] <IndoorSitup> @solidus_113 Did he?
[1:53:24] <malcobraaklynny> There are no spoilers since he's already played Halo 3
[1:53:29] <+smikeye> @malcobraaklynny I know, I was wondering why they weren't playing on xbone since Woolie first wanted to try and splitscreen on PC which isn't available yet
[1:53:33] <RickSaintRiot> did they need to be that close to glass??
[1:53:36] <phantalime> did they change it??
[1:53:37] <DigitalJoshie> its fine as he has the bibble
[1:53:39] <Buddha0991> they changed it
[1:53:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wow it's nothing
[1:53:50] <Halospaz117> conglaturation
[1:53:51] <derap41> Ah HDD loading
[1:53:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Fact
[1:54:01] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yay you did it

[1:54:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> God I love this game
[1:55:00] <+getinthetent> Halo's a cool guy
[1:55:02] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah did all of halo 2 happen during this?
[1:55:07] <$RunningNGunning> Halo is a cool guy
[1:55:08] <+yhom_tork> earth is getting glassed no big deal
[1:55:11] <DigitalJoshie> micky knows about the flood
[1:55:11] <RickSaintRiot> glassed 2 sq km and was like "ehhhhh job well done"
[1:55:14] <Halospaz117> I think Halo 2 might still be happening
[1:55:18] <resloxxx> haHAA
[1:55:20] <%DukeAtomic> @DianaTheAscian Halo 2 is currently happening
[1:55:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> More like Dearth
[1:55:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood
[1:55:32] <andre11dr> Do they even know the Chief
[1:55:32] <DigitalJoshie> god ODST music Kreygasm
[1:55:33] <Nomad94> the Ark portal, that is
[1:55:33] <%TheEpicTree> Those new africans are sure making themselves bat home
[1:55:35] <@Solidus_113> Clap
[1:55:43] <+getinthetent> I might be brain damaged but the Halo storyline is hard for me to follow sometimes
[1:55:43] <subjectg> @digitaljoshie gotta make everyone know it’s eczema
[1:55:44] <%TheEpicTree> at*
[1:55:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Wait thats it?
[1:55:49] <%Lion_kun> So uh what was the point of the story?
[1:55:51] <malcobraaklynny> @IndoorSitup they're integrated
[1:55:57] <%DukeAtomic> @Lion_kun it was just a fun side-story
[1:55:57] <sniffy77> funfact they used the multiplayer map orbital for this
[1:55:59] <+yhom_tork> PogChamp
[1:56:00] <derap41> HE SAID IT
[1:56:03] <+smikeye> 1 month later and she's still wearing combat armor?
[1:56:04] <RickSaintRiot> the point was that aliens built the pyramids fROM THE TOP DOWN
[1:56:06] <$RunningNGunning> HE SAID IT CLAP
[1:56:06] <IndoorSitup> AYYY
[1:56:10] <%Mr_Strut> Alien sex?
[1:56:12] <%alpacasintophats> no it isn't
[1:56:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE BOY
[1:56:13] <Halospaz117> Johnson is about to seduce this fucking alien
[1:56:13] <Ynkubus_> no its not
[1:56:15] <%alpacasintophats> this is just before halo 3
[1:56:15] <+condemned_15> there IS a Legendary ending as well
[1:56:18] <%Irridium> I think they'd be back by now
[1:56:20] <%alpacasintophats> which is weeks after halo 2
[1:56:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Lion_kun They learned the Covenant is digging for something in Africa... despite them doing it this entire time.
[1:56:24] <dinnydanny777> It knows how to catch
[1:56:26] <+getinthetent> Johson the true MC
[1:56:26] <sniffy77> billions
[1:56:27] <Ynkubus_> thers also a tilt camera moment here
[1:56:29] <%alpacasintophats> which is when the majority of this game takes place
[1:56:30] <Halospaz117> I wanna say this is between 2 and 3 here
[1:56:37] <dinnydanny777> What if it doesn't speak English
[1:56:38] <%TheEpicTree> don't you mean billions
[1:56:45] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[1:56:47] <%DukeAtomic> HOLD LEFT

[1:56:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> New best fried
[1:56:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> Who doesn’t speak English
[1:56:58] <subjectg> Fun fact: panning the camera gives you a great view of buck grooming a monkey
[1:56:58] <SauceJockey> this is between 2 and 3, the chief's jump from high charity to earth took a couple of weeks? i want to say
[1:56:59] <%DukeAtomic> they missed buck and the caveman lol oh well
[1:57:01] <malcobraaklynny> This game literally begins at the end of the Metropolis level in Halo 2
[1:57:02] <Heyestus> honorary boi
[1:57:03] <RamenRiderZ> THE BEST BOY
[1:57:04] <%Lion_kun> This is like the Portable Ops of Halo
[1:57:04] <%ZeroCruz> We did it ALL HALO GAMES BEATEN woolieGASM
[1:57:08] <+condemned_15> Legendary Ending
[1:57:12] <Halospaz117> Seargent Johnson can communicate with Aliens through sheer Machismo
[1:57:12] <rytisone> now to watch audio logs on youtbe
[1:57:14] <%DomunDomunDomun> Johnson was back in time to meet chief at the start of 3.
[1:57:19] <Jashter18> Game CLEAR
[1:57:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dead
[1:57:21] <andre11dr> "You caught a new Pokemon"
[1:57:25] <mesamus> now the audio logs
[1:57:25] <%alpacasintophats> dead
[1:57:28] <derap41> Learning what the ladies Like
[1:57:32] <sniffy77> look bungie kinda just did their own thing with the timeline. Look at what they did with reach
[1:57:33] <IndoorSitup> Time to watch some terminals!
[1:57:37] <+getinthetent> pog Halo lore discussion
[1:57:39] <+FateNero> We did, we cleared the Bungie collection
[1:57:40] <%Dean_Inbetween> 6 months he was dead
[1:57:41] <+Curbsnipe> Slipspace takes a lot of time
[1:57:45] <centuronstar> He was on Earth. And around that time he talked to Vergil
[1:57:46] <Thepothero> Woolie has finished the fight there are no more games ....
[1:57:50] <%TheEpicTree> Don't worry about it
[1:57:52] <Halospaz117> He was on the ship for a bit, yes
[1:57:53] <Explodincatz> just like Zelda, ignore the timelines
[1:57:56] <RamenRiderZ> Halo: Johnson when NotLikeThis
[1:57:57] <Ynkubus_> The issue is that things are rarely time stamped in the campaigns
[1:57:58] <+condemned_15> Chief was imprisoned on the ship during a comic
[1:57:58] <Heyestus> johnson picks chief up at 3 start. he left with keyes in 2
[1:58:00] <+smikeye> now Halo4 !
[1:58:00] <%D00msDayDan> Johnson got back to earth before chief did
[1:58:02] <derap41> They got some intel
[1:58:05] <Nomad94> Slipspace travel isn't instntaneous
[1:58:08] <%jinking79> hugging a Elite
[1:58:09] <%ZeroCruz> Yup there’s nothing else left woolieCHAN
[1:58:11] <DigitalJoshie> it is some side story
[1:58:22] <trackles_64> Dr Halsey would know
[1:58:22] <IndoorSitup> TERMINAL TIME
[1:58:26] <rytisone> and with that we're done with Bungie
[1:58:26] <%Dean_Inbetween> Until 4 gets released on the mcc
[1:58:30] <DianaTheAscian> the fight is over, yup thats it, not anything else nope, absolutely nothing
[1:58:34] <malcobraaklynny> Chief didn't know about the Ark
[1:58:40] <jackelzxaa> thats a good midquel
[1:58:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> There's also the Legendary ending cutscene
[1:58:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:58:43] <+yhom_tork> they can play 4
[1:58:49] <lucky_icarus> well they can still play 4 on xbone
[1:58:52] <%ZeroCruz> What 4?
[1:58:53] <RickSaintRiot> master queef collection
[1:58:56] <MajoraZ> Buck
[1:59:01] <jackelzxaa> going 2 ODST 3 seems like the good order
[1:59:03] <+FateNero> Buck
[1:59:05] <RickSaintRiot> wait wait. ASSter queef collection
[1:59:09] <+FateNero> He survived Reach
[1:59:10] <Jashter18> Buck
[1:59:10] <%KiboSenshi> @dean_inbetween yah they could play 4 now if they stay on Xbox coop
[1:59:10] <Halospaz117> Yeah, Buck is a survivor of Reach
[1:59:13] <jackelzxaa> because thats an mcu tease of 3
[1:59:17] <jackelzxaa> mcy style
[1:59:17] <RamenRiderZ> And so Master Chief kept drifting in space, eventually stopped thinking :) nothing else happened
[1:59:19] <jackelzxaa> *mcu style
[1:59:22] <+smikeye> Do Halo Wars 1+2
[1:59:26] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Terminals?
[1:59:36] <Halospaz117> He even had a freakout here when the Glassing started because it reminded him of Reach
[1:59:42] <DianaTheAscian> Rookie has a job and he will get it done
[1:59:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Rookie Final Boss of Halo 6
[1:59:43] <Jashter18> That's why he says "This is just like Reach all over again" in this one
[1:59:43] <$RunningNGunning> GGs
[1:59:47] <rytisone> Black Flag LP confirmed
[1:59:47] <malcobraaklynny> Did they collect all the audio logs?
[1:59:52] <RickSaintRiot> gg = good glassing
[1:59:52] <%stayinthepocket> ODST oozing with style
[1:59:54] <jackelzxaa> i expected some double cross thing
[1:59:55] <Torivore> Might as well do 4 on console since we've already cracked open the xbone case
[2:00:06] <%DukeAtomic> @Torivore time for the dead rising 3 lp
[2:00:16] <%jinking79> Halo Infinite gonna be crazy
[2:00:18] <prime_name> My personal favorite Halo
[2:00:18] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Rookie outranks Mikey in rank for God sake.
[2:00:28] <derap41> But Squad Super Soldiers
[2:00:39] <%Dean_Inbetween> It was not handled well in 5 gameplay wise
[2:00:39] <%Irridium> In Halo 5. Which has no splitscreen.
[2:00:39] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus You guys gonna watch the terminala for this game? It's called "Sadie's Story".
[2:00:47] <%TheEpicTree> the reflection
[2:00:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE
[2:00:55] <RickSaintRiot> Reach makes me feel like being a supersoldier is pointless
[2:00:59] <RickSaintRiot> because MC never dies
[2:01:10] <derap41> This game especially is meant to be played on single
[2:01:12] <RickSaintRiot> and like SIX of these Spartans go super quick
[2:01:14] <RamenRiderZ> New Mombasa the biggest snow globe on Earth
[2:01:18] <malcobraaklynny> Bungie didn't do Wars anyway
[2:01:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HALO 2 POG 4EVER
[2:01:27] <%DomunDomunDomun> Spartans never die.
[2:01:28] <+condemned_15> Halo Wars is from the Crackdown 1 devs I think
[2:01:33] <%KiboSenshi> excited for this list lol
[2:01:39] <%Dean_Inbetween> What halo is to me is the mystery of the forruner structures
[2:01:43] <%Irridium> Nah Halo Wars was Ensemble
[2:01:44] <+yhom_tork> PogChamp
[2:01:44] <+smikeye> no, Halo Wars 1 was Ensemble, a longtime RTS studio
[2:01:44] <Xiangchang> Ensemble Studios did Halo Wars 1.
[2:01:45] <centuronstar> Oh boy here we go. Halo 4 next
[2:01:50] <+condemned_15> got it
[2:01:53] <Explodincatz> it will take an hour for all the logs
[2:01:55] <Xiangchang> May Ensemble rest in peace.
[2:01:56] <rytisone> we can see on a reflection
[2:01:59] <dreadedcthulhu> halo wars was the first ensemble game since AoE3 right?
[2:02:05] <Jmann1892> WoolieVS Halo Wars when?
[2:02:07] <%TheEpicTree> Grandfather Woolie
[2:02:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The worst UI in the world
[2:02:11] <cpt_rezz> Halo4 gets a lot of unnessery hate
[2:02:15] <%KiboSenshi> why not just YouTube app

[2:02:18] <RickSaintRiot> GEE GRAMPA
[2:02:23] <malcobraaklynny> no the logs are quite long
[2:02:26] <SauceJockey> be sure to watch the special cutscenes and extra part of the data hive mission that are changed for getting all of the audio logs

[2:02:30] <cpt_rezz> which is a shame cause i love halo4
[2:02:31] <IndoorSitup> The logs are pretty long
[2:02:31] <%Irridium> I mean there are 30 logs
[2:02:31] <%DukeAtomic> No 50 minutes I think seems right
[2:02:33] <kikoeru_san> no bro it's long as fuck
[2:02:37] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus 50 minutes is about right\
[2:02:38] <+Icekong_1001> 50 minutes sound right
[2:02:39] <subjectg> There are a lotta logs in sadie’s story
[2:02:39] <lucky_icarus> I'm honestly really excited for Woolie to play 4.
[2:02:40] <IndoorSitup> The logs are LONG

[2:02:47] <@Menitta> Aw I had an american tim hortons recently and it was super good tho
[2:02:48] <%ozzrabbit> And now, Woolie needs to watch Halo Legends for more context!

[2:03:09] <ralphfromdk> Most of them are not plot important like the other games.
[2:03:10] <IndoorSitup> IT'S WORTH IT
[2:03:10] <+smikeye> 1.5x time it
[2:03:11] <+Curbsnipe> Yeeee
[2:03:12] <Explodincatz> not worth imo
[2:03:13] <@Solidus_113> play it at 1.5 speed

[2:03:31] <%TheEpicTree> BibleThump
[2:03:32] <Torivore> Good call
[2:03:32] <stormhawk9891> It's a pretty decent story on it's own
[2:03:34] <+Curbsnipe> Its quality
[2:03:34] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> it's an audio drama. just do it on your own time. lol
[2:03:35] <IndoorSitup> awwwwww

[2:03:50] <%ZeroCruz> This is fine
[2:03:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> as long as we get to hear what you think afterwards
[2:03:55] <@Menitta> Oh they just finished ODST
[2:03:59] <%hattrick61> fair nuff
[2:04:04] <IndoorSitup> The Terminals are legit REALLY good though
[2:04:06] <DianaTheAscian> oh yeah u can watch legends now
[2:04:15] <%TheEpicTree> Halo 2
[2:04:16] <prime_name> Good call
[2:04:22] <+Lewdicrus00Q> HALO LEGENDS MOVIE NIGHT
[2:04:22] <subjectg> separate tier list for music?
[2:04:23] <rytisone> time to shit on Halo
[2:04:23] <%Dean_Inbetween> 2
[2:04:24] <+smikeye> bungie stories are bad
[2:04:25] <derap41> 2 Reach ODST 1 3 then the rest
[2:04:28] <%Dean_Inbetween> 2 story wise
[2:04:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 3 = Reach >ODST > 2 > 1
[2:04:30] <+marumariball> halo dos
[2:04:31] <$emptyantics> Halo 2
[2:04:32] <%Dean_Inbetween> 3 gameplay
[2:04:33] <andre11dr> For me Reach, 2,3,ODST,1
[2:04:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YES
[2:04:36] <+FateNero> 2 is best story
[2:04:38] <$emptyantics> Hello dos
[2:04:42] <centuronstar> NICE
[2:04:42] <RickSaintRiot> idk, 50/30 = 1m40s per audiolog
[2:04:45] <+smikeye> 2 would be good if it didn't end like shit
[2:04:45] <%stayinthepocket> Yep
[2:04:45] <ThatGuyThere03> You have chosen wisely
[2:04:52] <prime_name> Personally: 2, ODST, 3, Reach, 1
[2:04:59] <%Dean_Inbetween> 2 is the jankiest gameplay wise LUL
[2:04:59] <derap41> Woolie is confirmed correct
[2:05:05] <%DukeAtomic> 2, ODST, 3, Reach, 1 is correct
[2:05:05] <subjectg> Reach > 2 > ODST > 3 = 1 for me
[2:05:06] <+yhom_tork> the blur cutscenes Kreygasm
[2:05:08] <%Dean_Inbetween> 2 definitely story wise tho
[2:05:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> the one with the best graphics
[2:05:10] <%stayinthepocket> 2 is the right answer
[2:05:11] <%DukeAtomic> 2 has the absolutely best plot
[2:05:25] <rytisone> wars
[2:05:27] <%TheEpicTree> Reach
[2:05:27] <$RunningNGunning> If we're just ranking campaigns, then I'd agree with 2
[2:05:29] <derap41> Fair choice
[2:05:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> Halo 2 fucking goes
[2:05:36] <+FateNero> 2, 3, Reach, ODST, 1
[2:05:38] <%Dean_Inbetween> 2 was supposed to be the finale for a reason
[2:05:47] <RickSaintRiot> 2, 3, ODST, 1, Reach
[2:05:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:05:53] <derap41> Drags a bit sometimes tho
[2:05:59] <RickSaintRiot> well, 3 is really just "2 part 2"
[2:06:05] <derap41> A bit like Firefly
[2:06:11] <andre11dr> Reach makes the Covenant scary
[2:06:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 3 was more character driven imo, considering all that was going on
[2:06:16] <DigitalJoshie> me personally like ODST, Reach, and 2
[2:06:20] <%Dean_Inbetween> reach is the opposite of what halo is supposed to be for me but as a game in its own right its still great
[2:06:24] <Jashter18> Mine goes 3, Reach , ODST , 2
[2:06:30] <%Dean_Inbetween> 3 is the marvels endgame
[2:06:30] <%KiboSenshi> 3>reach,2,>4, odst> 1, 5 personally
[2:06:32] <subjectg> i’d rank Halo 3 a little bit above 1 because those H3 terminals are amazing
[2:06:36] <%Dean_Inbetween> That was horribly rushed
[2:06:51] <%KiboSenshi> I love them all really tho
[2:06:54] <Halospaz117> Reach is one of my favorite endings to a game period
[2:06:56] <prime_name> Different tones
[2:07:14] <ThatGuyThere03> Ayo Chief hit that ramp
[2:07:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> Reach does the military shooter thing better than most shooters
[2:07:23] <RickSaintRiot> the parts with Reach when you're alone are the best. easily.
[2:07:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> There was a lot of cut content because of rushed development
[2:07:46] <RickSaintRiot> Jorge stuff is good also.
[2:07:46] <%Dean_Inbetween> OH WOOLIE i cant wait until you see all the cut shit they cut out of 3 thats why its a little weak @woolieversus
[2:07:58] <%KiboSenshi> yo that warthog run tho
[2:08:00] <%Dean_Inbetween> 3 had some BIG shit missing
[2:08:02] <RamenRiderZ> Reach's Firefight and Invasion modes were the best
[2:08:03] <+smikeye> bungie's history as a studio ends up being a lot of "rushed to get out the door and cut tons of content"
[2:08:16] <prime_name> There are some bungled threads in 3 from 2
[2:08:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Dean_Inbetween So did Halo 2
[2:08:20] <rytisone> shoulda brought flood Arbiters on Cortana
[2:08:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Halo 3's jump was in multiplayer. It was massive
[2:08:42] <%DukeAtomic> @smikeye Every Destiny expansion you basically can find lined in concept art for the original release, Bungie might uh, be bad at planning
[2:08:42] <MetroidSlayerP7> Halo 1 has the pistol, though
[2:08:42] <%Dean_Inbetween> But 2 was supposed to be an entirely different game in its own right @canadiananimatorguy
[2:08:54] <subjectg> Halo 3’s big jump was in community features
[2:08:59] <%DukeAtomic> The big thing that launched Halo 3 into the stratosphere in popularity was the multiplayer
[2:09:04] <$emptyantics> Bungie sucks at planning
[2:09:04] <%Dean_Inbetween> That’s because 2 was originally supposed to be the finale and 3 is just a refined 2
[2:09:17] <DigitalJoshie> halo 2's story was soo good
[2:09:25] <$RunningNGunning> Halo 3's best parts are stuff that Woolie didn't get to see unfortunately
[2:09:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 3 need a Blur Remake
[2:09:27] <+smikeye> @smikeye oh yeah, I dropped Destiny after base campaign and never touched it again, I only played Destiny 2 cuz I got it free and again past campaign I don't care
[2:09:32] <Torivore> I don't know another series that has a big of jump in quality as Halo 1 to 2
[2:09:40] <%Dean_Inbetween> Theyre adding everything back into 3 once they add the modding into 3
[2:09:44] <@Menitta> Even the flood gets fleshed out
[2:09:48] <@Menitta> pun intended
[2:09:48] <subjectg> Theater mode, forge mode, matchmaking, those were 3’s greatest strengths
[2:09:49] <derap41> Zerg
[2:09:53] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yes that was the point of 2 and its grey
[2:09:53] <+BigBlackBankai> ME to ME2
[2:09:54] <mark1247> Sweet
[2:09:56] <%Dean_Inbetween> Great
[2:10:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Dean_Inbetween REALLY? PogChamp
[2:10:05] <DigitalJoshie> halo 3 has some sick gameplay moments, but it has less in terms of story
[2:10:10] <rytisone> Halo 2 completely finished with Halo 3 would have been THE game
[2:10:25] <derap41> oh that's why woolie likes it so much
[2:10:27] <%Mr_Strut> Spacism is so good
[2:10:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SPACISM
[2:10:29] <derap41> Space Racism
[2:10:40] <$emptyantics> We SPACISTS NOW
[2:10:41] <+FateNero> Halo 3 had the best multiplayer and some of the best missions
[2:10:44] <vulkan_vibes> STARGUMENTS
[2:10:45] <%Dean_Inbetween> @ballerswagbro9k look up rejectedshotgun on youtube and the cut guardian boss battle and look up the bungie restoration project its led by former bungie people
[2:10:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This is like me judging the Street Fighter series off only playing arcade mode
[2:10:56] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @vulkan_vibes That was me!
[2:11:03] <%Irridium> getting angry again at how the majority of people didn't like the arbiter sections in 2 so they ended up just not focusing on the aliens as much in 3.
[2:11:04] <derap41> Then poof gone
[2:11:06] <+shadowassassin887> then in halo reach its a meme of being "elite preferred species"
[2:11:13] <andre11dr> Also Halo 2 gave Arbiter way more stuff to do, in 3 he's just kind around Chief doing things
[2:11:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I'm so happy that caught traction
[2:11:15] <RickSaintRiot> The Halo campaign's a little more important than the Arcade mode
[2:11:18] <Dumple_Roe> due to writers crunch
[2:11:20] <%Dean_Inbetween> @ballerswagbro9k they cant say because of NDAs and will get the go ahead once modding is implemented
[2:11:23] <%KiboSenshi> the amount of hours I put into Halo 3s custom games is ridiculous
[2:11:29] <derap41> Rip Dneedlers
[2:11:34] <DigitalJoshie> thats too OP tho
[2:11:36] <tanarath> The start of 2 was very jaring to me. You go from barely understanding the Covenant to [spoilers]
[2:11:39] <vulkan_vibes> proid of you @reverend_roscoe
[2:11:47] <rytisone> the first half is not so important
[2:11:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Campaign is like 10% of the game time spent on Halo 3 at most
[2:12:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Dean_Inbetween BRUH THATS AMAZING
[2:12:08] <DigitalJoshie> halo 3 was surprisingly not rushed
[2:12:11] <Lieutenant_America> The second half of 3 was the weak half?
[2:12:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @vulkan_vibes thanks, it's my one thing in life lol
[2:12:20] <%stayinthepocket> 3 has two of the best levels in the series immediately into one of the worst
[2:12:21] <derap41> Think all the jank hurt ODST
[2:12:21] <Explodincatz> hell na
[2:12:26] <%Dean_Inbetween> Dont worry those reasons will not go away woolie
[2:12:27] <mark1247> Come on
[2:12:37] <%KiboSenshi> story wise 1
[2:12:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> If people watched the dev doc on Halo 2 it was pushed out the door wAY too early
[2:13:10] <$serpenttucker> presentation=/=story
[2:13:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:13:15] <%KiboSenshi> I agree
[2:13:17] <%Irridium> the "vibe" if you will
[2:13:25] <%Dean_Inbetween> Those story threads aren’t dead woolie it goes much deeper if you care to look into the expanded universe but That’ll be like a thousand years from now :3
[2:13:29] <+FlubbedPig> ODST excels at mood yeah
[2:13:31] <RickSaintRiot> vibe check? odst
[2:13:33] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus The presentation?
[2:13:34] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:13:36] <derap41> mood
[2:13:40] <ralphfromdk> And thus the Halo series is done and there were no more games :l
[2:13:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Looking up at a Halo ring at the first time is a huge vibe, people take it for granted now

[2:14:00] <Xiangchang> Can't wait for the deep dive into Halo 4!
[2:14:02] <$RunningNGunning> @CanadianAnimatorGuy from what i've heard, that is incredibly common in game development, its just that Halo 2s development is so well documented
[2:14:02] <Heyestus> nebulous as fuck, yo
[2:14:06] <%KiboSenshi> @ralphfromdk cmon 4 is pretty good campaign wise
[2:14:09] <%Dean_Inbetween> @ballerswagbro9k there was going to be a boss battle against the gravemind, just lool up the graveminds cut dialogue its on youtube
[2:14:11] <$jake5713> Halo Wars 2 now required reading for Halo Infinite story since 4,5 and Infinite's stories feel SOOOO DISJOINTED.
[2:14:12] <+BigBlackBankai> Honestly all the Bungie games are worth being someones favorite
[2:14:22] <prime_name> ODST is an experience
[2:14:26] <Saffry_Ruzin> "Hrrrrnngh, Supreme Commander, I'm trying to Hunt the Demon, but I'm dummy thicc and the squeaking of my undersuit keeps alerting the Humans." - Zuka 'Zamamee (September 21st, 2552)
[2:14:27] <Hammatime8> ODST be vibin' hard
[2:14:30] <prime_name> A movement, if you would
[2:14:33] <DigitalJoshie> ODST is so nice
[2:14:56] <%TheEpicTree> Halo 4's theme tales a different turn
[2:14:57] <+smikeye> I for one was excited to see the Banished being pulled into "regular" Halo
[2:15:01] <%Dean_Inbetween> I bet if woolie played the mods that add in all the cut stuff woolies opinion on 2 and 3 will change significantly ItsHappening LUL
[2:15:02] <UltimateDomon> Did they beat the game?
[2:15:08] <Torivore> In ODST people talk with their hands in cutscenes, definitely adds to the different vibe
[2:15:18] <%Dean_Inbetween> That will happen 5 years from now lol
[2:15:22] <RickSaintRiot> yeah more alien politics in the future, we can only hope
[2:15:24] <idiotscampaign> make a point of listening to the ODST credits theme. it's a mashup of the whole soundtrack and i love it
[2:15:24] <+getinthetent> dw needlers the funnest shit
[2:15:51] <derap41> Should have been a default not a power
[2:15:52] <Halospaz117> My favorite Gameplay is still 3
[2:15:55] <%stayinthepocket> RUNNING BAD
[2:16:00] <%Dean_Inbetween> Like when arbiter was gonna be called the dervish ItsHappening
[2:16:02] <+FateNero> Drm in multiplayer is much better than battle rifle in halo 3
[2:16:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @RunningNGunning Halo 3 had just as much if not more documentation, but it went a lot smoother comparatively. Granted Bungie had more of a grasp on what they were doing, but they were also ambitious as hell with 3.
[2:16:05] <+BigBlackBankai> Halo fans love sprint
[2:16:07] <Explodincatz> sorint was way to stiff
[2:16:07] <+FlubbedPig> Evade > Sprint too bad it's Multiplayer Only
[2:16:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> And they changed it due to racism against somalis
[2:16:28] <RickSaintRiot> Keeping it a power was probably erring on the side of caution.
[2:16:33] <%Dean_Inbetween> The halo 2 br is the most op fucking weapon
[2:16:37] <%Irridium> Honestly I loved that sprint let me replace it with something else to fuck with people in multiplayer. Never gets old punking someone with a hologram
[2:16:40] <Torivore> Halo 2 pistol best gun
[2:16:42] <Manjove> while i personally like the DMR better, but the BR is better
[2:16:44] <+FateNero> Halo 2 BR is great
[2:16:51] <rytisone> poor jetpack gets forgoten
[2:16:54] <+FateNero> Feels op like the pistol of 1
[2:17:06] <%D00msDayDan> I have a feeling 4 and 5 will be his favorite gameplay wise
[2:17:11] <%stayinthepocket> Lol Woolie may actually love the gameplay of 5
[2:17:15] <mark1247> Ok
[2:17:20] <$emptyantics> BATTLE RIFLE FUCKS
[2:17:26] <%Dean_Inbetween> 4 and 5 are much more following trends and less halo
[2:17:27] <Torivore> As he should
[2:17:34] <%stayinthepocket> And he should cause it's good
[2:17:36] <%KiboSenshi> gameplay in 5 was great, I thought
[2:17:38] <%Irridium> I mean 5's gameplay is genuinely good, it's just everything around it is not good
[2:17:41] <$jake5713> DMR still here
[2:17:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Advanced mobility affects multiplayer the worst, which we all know he won't touch.
[2:17:51] <%Irridium> 5's multiplayer is legit real good
[2:17:54] <%Dean_Inbetween> If woolie enjoys those things and thats why he likes halo thats fine but thats not what halo is at its core
[2:17:56] <$jake5713> *DMR Gang still here
[2:17:59] <+FateNero> The gameplay in Halo 4 and 5 is great, only the campaign is the problem
[2:18:05] <@Menitta> the best Halo soundtrack is Arbiter's theme in Killer Instinct
[2:18:14] <%Dean_Inbetween> ^^^
[2:18:21] <+smikeye> oh, he's got the Halo 4 Spartan Ops campaign to do too
[2:18:27] <$emptyantics> @menitta Based
[2:18:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Spartan OPS LUL
[2:18:39] <%stayinthepocket> @smikeye Naaaah no he doesn't
[2:18:41] <%KiboSenshi> the spops campaign was meh
[2:18:42] <+FateNero> I forgot about spartan ops
[2:18:45] <+FateNero> LUL
[2:18:50] <%Irridium> oh god I forgot about Spartan Ops LUL
[2:18:59] <$emptyantics> Spops campaign...NOT GOOD
[2:19:02] <mesamus> they can skip spartan ops and see the cutscenes
[2:19:02] <Buddha0991> they should just watch spartan ops cutscenes
[2:19:05] <WolfemanMaverik> farthest outpost and on a pale horse?
[2:19:12] <%KiboSenshi> Tru,there's not alot
[2:19:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You don't like Firefight with extra steps? /s
[2:19:27] <+BigBlackBankai> He shouldn't do Spartan Ops, worst letdown in Halo history
[2:19:27] <Halospaz117> mmmmmm One Final Effort is so fucking good
[2:19:28] <$RunningNGunning> 3 is my fav theme
[2:19:30] <idiotscampaign> ironically, Never Forget
[2:19:32] <Halospaz117> The sad one is Never Forget
[2:19:36] <%Dean_Inbetween> I think woolie should replay all these games by himself because i get the feeling the fact he couldn’t take his time with these games really skewed his memory no offense to woolie or v I barely remember what im doing if im playing coop
[2:19:42] <Halospaz117> I prefer it's version in 2 Unforgotten personally
[2:19:58] <Halospaz117> Though I think the best version of Unforgotten is the one in Legends
[2:20:06] <subjectg> hoobastank of all things has a song on the H2 OST
[2:20:11] <$RunningNGunning> 3 kinda did do that, but only in terms of multiplayer
[2:20:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1315888762120011783?s=19
[2:20:21] <%Dean_Inbetween> I think 3 does that gameplay wise most halo fans will tell you thats the case
[2:20:30] <derap41> Like they're even near the list
[2:20:30] <malcobraaklynny> @Dean_Inbetween They changed the Arbiter's name from Dervish because it's a type of thing in Islam
[2:20:33] <Torivore> Follow Our Brothers slaps so hard
[2:20:37] <Halospaz117> Also, while I do give the non-Marty OSTs shit, 4 does have a great remix of Never Forget
[2:20:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> All of the Bungie ones hold up super well, as we've seen.
[2:20:45] <$emptyantics> Hoobastank Halo 2 OST - I’m not a perfect person
[2:20:45] <%Dean_Inbetween> @malcobraaklynny its a somali religious position
[2:20:49] <@Solidus_113> 4 has some really neat weapons
[2:21:00] <+ZacharyWile> 4? :O
[2:21:04] <stormhawk9891> Gun feel in 4 is really good
[2:21:04] <lucky_icarus> 4 has some really neat new toys
[2:21:06] <+FateNero> If I go with nostalgia I play all the bungie games in chronological ordar
[2:21:07] <derap41> Gameplay is always good but Halo needs more than that
[2:21:11] <+smikeye> Halo 4 looks amazing for that generation of hardware
[2:21:13] <WolfemanMaverik> 4 does a lot of interesting things gameplay and story wise
[2:21:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah... killstreaks...
[2:21:20] <%stayinthepocket> Oh God WRONG answer
[2:21:22] <%Dean_Inbetween> 4s story beats can be really great
[2:21:27] <+BigBlackBankai> Heresy...
[2:21:29] <Xiangchang> 4's environmental moments are gonna be great.
[2:21:30] <egnarOelpruP> I hate 4's campaign
[2:21:30] <Torivore> 4 has my fav shotgun in the series
[2:21:33] <%KiboSenshi> yeah o feel that 4 had really nice story beats
[2:21:36] <+Dova573> custom games made halo 3 mp for me
[2:21:38] <%stayinthepocket> Boo this man
[2:21:38] <%Irridium> Ah Halo 4 multipalyer, where they removed weapon placements and made them killstreaks
[2:21:40] <+Seiryu99> Remember spending days with the boi's playing campaign in 2, getting out the map and glitching
[2:21:41] <%Dean_Inbetween> Most people would say 4s multiplayer was really imbalanced
[2:21:44] <%alpacasintophats> 5 story does fuck with 4s hard
[2:21:46] <andre11dr> 4 looked amazing for its time
[2:21:47] <%alpacasintophats> I will give him that
[2:22:03] <+getinthetent> story gang
[2:22:04] <@Menitta> whaaaat Halo has story bois?
[2:22:05] <Heyestus> 5s multiplayer was actually pretty good
[2:22:06] <%stayinthepocket> OR BOTH
[2:22:07] <+FateNero> The question is: will like Halo 4?
[2:22:07] <+smikeye> 4s story "ends" in a comic miniseries
[2:22:08] <+Seiryu99> Best part of halo 2 was exploring all the glitches
[2:22:12] <+Dova573> custom games is were is at
[2:22:16] <+FateNero> Will woolie like halo 4?
[2:22:21] <%alpacasintophats> that being said, I really like how we can just ignore 5's story completely
[2:22:26] <%alpacasintophats> and never discuss it ever
[2:22:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Favvyn has some great videos about Halo multiplayer
[2:22:35] <%Dean_Inbetween> Most people think 3 and reach have the best gameplay, and most people says 2 is the best story wise
[2:22:38] <%ozzrabbit> Lol, I’m probably the oddball that still loves playing Destiny 2 despite all its problems because Bungie STILL makes guns that feel good.
[2:22:43] <SirKeigan> On break at work. Why aren't they playing?
[2:22:51] <$RunningNGunning> 1 did couch coop better than anyone else at the time
[2:22:54] <subjectg> they’re done
[2:22:58] <mesamus> guys just wait till woolie plays 4
[2:22:59] <%Dean_Inbetween> 4 has highs and lows with both
[2:23:02] <%ZeroCruz> I dislike 4 but visually the game's a looker, it used all the power from the 360
[2:23:04] <%KiboSenshi> @alpacasintophats I mean that's what I infinites gonna do lol
[2:23:04] <Buddha0991> they better not ignore 5, im the kind of person who hates it when stuff that isnt well liked is just ignored, you made this move dont cower out and address your stuff
[2:23:05] <@Menitta> the answer is Nioh 2
[2:23:12] <@Menitta> Kappa
[2:23:13] <SirKeigan> Dark Souls 3 LP?
[2:23:13] <Torivore> When will 343 bring back Ricochet
[2:23:24] <subjectg> the best dark souls game is armored core obv
[2:23:25] <%alpacasintophats> @KiboSenshi which is why I have some modicum of hope for it being good.
[2:23:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie played DmC, he won't ignore 5 lol
[2:23:31] <+Dova573> Ds3,DS1,DS2
[2:23:32] <+FateNero> I was hyped for Infinite so I played all Halo games in chronological order, and after playing 4 & 5 it killed my hype BibleThump
[2:23:37] <Buddha0991> nah dont mean woolie i mean 343
[2:23:37] <%alpacasintophats> @KiboSenshi as a story mind
[2:23:39] <$serpenttucker> 1 is still the best for dumb sandbox fun and the simple story.
[2:23:40] <subjectg> fromsoft when is armored core dammit
[2:23:41] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is ez top
[2:23:44] <%Dean_Inbetween> 4 has greats highs and bad lows, 5 HAS AN AWFUL STORY, but a very expansive multiplayer @woolieversus
[2:23:53] <SirKeigan> RICHAAAAAAAARD!!!!
[2:23:57] <Buddha0991> 5 has really good MP but they screwed up Big Team Battle
[2:24:01] <egnarOelpruP> 5 has great gameplay, maybe not everything else
[2:24:02] <DigitalJoshie> LUL
[2:24:04] <$emptyantics> RICHAAAAAARDDDD!!!
[2:24:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Killing it" literally, because it's TERRIBLE
[2:24:18] <%stayinthepocket> 4s multiplayer is so not very good....
[2:24:22] <leomuratore> 4 is fine, it has good moments, it feels like a smaller scale story, if it's possible to say so.
[2:24:25] <%Irridium> Halo 5's multiplayer is what 4's should have been, honestly
[2:24:49] <+FlubbedPig> 4 had a different issue in that I seem to remember it had poor multiplayer support. Stuff like lacking gametypes that were franchise staples until DLC added them later.
[2:25:04] <derap41> Player fight clubs are still better than the official ones
[2:25:05] <%stayinthepocket> 2
[2:25:05] <%Dean_Inbetween> 4s multiplayer is some of the most fucked up and imbalnced with the series, its story tries to go really hard and its up to you wether it succeeds or not
[2:25:06] <subjectg> Which is funny because ds3 is one with the least depth in pvp
[2:25:08] <@Menitta> 5
[2:25:11] <%DukeAtomic> my favorite halo game is Marathon 2
[2:25:13] <andre11dr> Early DS3 PVP was mad broken
[2:25:18] <@Menitta> Kappa
[2:25:19] <Buddha0991> multiplayer
[2:25:20] <andre11dr> Dark Sword
[2:25:20] <Explodincatz> 1
[2:25:21] <trackles_64> Terible gampleay 5 has
[2:25:22] <Buddha0991> is good
[2:25:22] <WolfemanMaverik> nopa lmao
[2:25:23] <derap41> @subjectg Don't like Like attack spam
[2:25:25] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus 5's MP and map editor are great
[2:25:26] <ralphfromdk> Yeah, a shitty story
[2:25:27] <+BigBlackBankai> My favorite Halo is Destiny 2 (loljk)
[2:25:27] <kikoeru_san> DS3 invasions tho, very fun
[2:25:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Advanced mobility, for better and worse
[2:25:30] <xxshadowxx416> it gameplay
[2:25:34] <Shade075> 5 had Grunt Goblins at least
[2:25:34] <WolfemanMaverik> gameplay was good though
[2:25:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:25:35] <Saffry_Ruzin> DS1 and 2 had arenas too
[2:25:40] <%Dean_Inbetween> 5s multiplayer can be great
[2:25:40] <%Irridium> 5 gameplay was real good
[2:25:46] <xxshadowxx416> halo 5 has gameplay
[2:25:47] <%AMUSERNAME> 3 was where I had all the best custom game experiences with friends. The novelty of Forge and custom games hit me and my friend group perfectly!
[2:25:48] <%Dean_Inbetween> Its story is horrendous
[2:25:50] <dreadedcthulhu> 5 has the hover/ground pound, it's weird when u skipped everything from 3 forward
[2:25:51] <%KiboSenshi> 5s gameplay was great
[2:25:51] <+Andrizzleton> 4 player coop? Oh wait
[2:25:54] <%alpacasintophats> doesn't 4 have jetpacks too?
[2:25:58] <$emptyantics> 5 story is trashhhh
[2:26:00] <%D00msDayDan> 5 has the best mp I will die on this hill
[2:26:03] <%stayinthepocket> PACKING JET
[2:26:03] <%Dean_Inbetween> 5 has jet packs
[2:26:03] <subjectg> @derap41 i don’t like how gimped invaders are, and spammable rolls, yes
[2:26:04] <@Solidus_113> 4 does I'm pretty sure
[2:26:07] <dreadedcthulhu> 5 has a jetpack in base kit
[2:26:10] <%DukeAtomic> @BigBlackBankai It's basically Halo: Reach 3 gameplay wise
[2:26:11] <egnarOelpruP> my fav is 2 if only because I played it for at least 8 years
[2:26:12] <%Dean_Inbetween> 5 HAS JET PACKS
[2:26:14] <%Dean_Inbetween> GTFO
[2:26:15] <+yhom_tork> 4 and 5 hae them
[2:26:20] <+Andrizzleton> So does 4 + 5
[2:26:21] <egnarOelpruP> god bless it's multiplayer
[2:26:21] <derap41> Shame no Aliens Betrayed the Covenant for a Jetpack
[2:26:25] <rytisone> so the overall winner is Cole Protocol
[2:26:25] <Explodincatz> it wasnt even a real jetpack
[2:26:26] <Buddha0991> 4 lets you have sprint and jet pack
[2:26:26] <%D00msDayDan> 4 has a Jetpack too
[2:26:38] <Orien358> depending on how you see the new playstation update notes you may be more inclined to not be friends with playstation anymore
[2:26:42] <%DukeAtomic> are they jumping into 4 right now?
[2:26:45] <Buddha0991> no
[2:26:55] <@Solidus_113> Chief's story is DONE
[2:26:55] <DigitalJoshie> LUL
[2:26:58] <%stayinthepocket> huuurrrr duuurrrr
[2:26:59] <xxshadowxx416> halo 4
[2:27:00] <+BigBlackBankai> That's nuts
[2:27:03] <rytisone> were it so easy
[2:27:04] <%ZeroCruz> HALO IS DONE
[2:27:14] <+Andrizzleton> Can someone fill me in on the giant D
[2:27:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:27:17] <%ozzrabbit> The Reach jet pack. The early Destiny Titan Jump that gave them the Yeet!
[2:27:21] <Xiangchang> I can't believe they're playing Halo Wars next-
[2:27:41] <+BigBlackBankai> Are they?
[2:27:41] <%Irridium> these aren't even their first botches. shoutout to MCC xbone launch
[2:27:43] <derap41> Wasn't this a hire in studio
[2:27:51] <subjectg> so Halo Chronicles next? Kappa
[2:27:55] <%Dean_Inbetween> They botched it up early on but it seems they are trying harder now
[2:27:58] <+vaderxyz1970> The MCC isnt even the full series
[2:28:02] <Depthcharge2030> halo megablocks now?
[2:28:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> HALO WARS LE
[2:28:08] <%stayinthepocket> Nostalgia is too strong. It will never be matched.
[2:28:08] <egnarOelpruP> would actually love for woolie to touch halo wars, if only so he can watch the cutscenes
[2:28:09] <%hattrick61> @andrizzleton it's the Dokage hat
[2:28:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> HALO WARS LP CONFIRMED LETS GOOOO
[2:28:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 343 jank is real
[2:28:23] <+Andrizzleton> @hattrick61 ty
[2:28:25] <$serpenttucker> Woo Halo spartan assault Kappa
[2:28:29] <+BigBlackBankai> The Halo Tv show next?
[2:28:30] <LeBlanc233> halo wars would be cool
[2:28:35] <$emptyantics> 343 game’s feel weird
[2:28:38] <%D00msDayDan> Bungie spaghetti code
[2:28:39] <+smikeye> I'm the weirdo that thought Halo Infinite would've been fine
[2:28:40] <subjectg> livestream visit to outpost discovery lul
[2:28:49] <DigitalJoshie> they can
[2:28:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Dont forget Halo Infite 3 THANOS IN THE HOUSE
[2:29:04] <+FlubbedPig> A big problem with 343 seems to be that they're like 80% revolving door contract workers
[2:29:04] <%stayinthepocket> Mustard race wins again
[2:29:13] <%Dean_Inbetween> Halo 2s code is fucking made of spaghetti it’s amazing how well it turned out LUL
[2:29:43] <Drarrk> oof bad time bringing up achievement hunter
[2:29:56] <RickSaintRiot> don't mention it. don't say it. don't think it.
[2:29:57] <%faeron93> THey finished it
[2:30:03] <$emptyantics> Wait what’s happening at AH?
[2:30:05] <DigitalJoshie> OOF
[2:30:07] <derap41> ....eugh
[2:30:07] <+BigBlackBankai> They did eventually beat it and it was 3 hours
[2:30:09] <lucky_icarus> Uh oh!
[2:30:15] <mesamus> they finished it
[2:30:16] <%Irridium> UH OH
[2:30:17] <%ZeroCruz> Ruh roh
[2:30:20] <+Andrizzleton> Oh they finished
[2:30:20] <+crunchygrl> :/
[2:30:22] <Halospaz117> @emptyantics Best to just check the reddit dude
[2:30:22] <packers81> Those videos are going bye bye
[2:30:23] <RickSaintRiot> Due to Scandal
[2:30:23] <%DukeAtomic> I think he was fired
[2:30:26] <Depthcharge2030> oof
[2:30:27] <DigitalJoshie> grooming
[2:30:28] <UltimateDomon> Being a shit
[2:30:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OOPSY
[2:30:28] <+condemned_15> Ryan got fired for lewd shot with a minor
[2:30:30] <Jashter18> WOOLIES FUCKIN TURN
[2:30:30] <malcobraaklynny> anyone can take Ryan's place
[2:30:31] <ralphfromdk> Pedo reasons
[2:30:32] <+FlubbedPig> Left AH due to the big Yikes
[2:30:32] <%TheEpicTree> big oof
[2:30:33] <+getinthetent> o boy
[2:30:36] <derap41> They get to deal with their own shit over there
[2:30:36] <+BigBlackBankai> Everyone diddling kiddles
[2:30:38] <%Irridium> smash bros reasons
[2:30:39] <+condemned_15> Adam got busted too
[2:30:40] <@Solidus_113> the yikes reasons
[2:30:44] <%Mr_Strut> So standard shit?
[2:30:47] <OldManDeckardCain> the "projared" plays
[2:31:12] <%stayinthepocket> @oldmandeckardcain Except actually happened
[2:31:17] <crossing_mao> These gamers, dude
[2:31:21] <crossing_mao> I swear
[2:31:24] <rytisone> frustration is getting bigger
[2:31:27] <prime_name> Is it so hard not to be a creep?
[2:31:28] <Nomad94> SLASO is insanity
[2:31:37] <%faeron93> THey basically breezed through the majority of the game until they final section
[2:31:46] <derap41> Woolie Don't be getting any ideas now ok My heart couldn't take it
[2:31:49] <Steve1316> Ryan and Adam, oof x.x
[2:31:59] <dreadedcthulhu> slaso requires using some speedrun strategies and skips
[2:32:02] <derap41> Really Adam Too?!
[2:32:03] <%D00msDayDan> Master chief must die mode
[2:32:13] <UltimateDomon> Adam didn't fuck minors at least
[2:32:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> So is every video with Ryan gonna get sniped during the month
[2:32:17] <rytisone> or just glitch through most of the level
[2:32:17] <PrideOfFiddles> Ultra-nightmare or ultra-violance?
[2:32:19] <OldManDeckardCain> projared stuff didn't happen? I lost all interest in that thing after accidentally seeing projared's thing on my tl....
[2:32:21] <andresisant> Adam had his nides leaked hi didn´t groom minors
[2:32:23] <derap41> @UltimateDomon oh ok
[2:32:26] <DigitalJoshie> actually laso solo run is glitching the game hard like in 2
[2:32:32] <MooMan6457> I just came into the stream
[2:32:42] <DigitalJoshie> its a skill, but a skill in breaking the game
[2:32:43] <MooMan6457> What in the world
[2:32:53] <+condemned_15> He was catfished by someone who he thought was a minor. the creepiness still stands
[2:33:00] <+Gamblitz> Wasn't Joel Heyman also fired for similar reasons?
[2:33:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I'm glad Woolie got to experience it on his own.
[2:33:12] <malcobraaklynny> Adam's deal was taking some *pics* at the workplace
[2:33:23] <malcobraaklynny> @Gamblitz I don't think so
[2:33:28] <andresisant> But he did take videos from his wife and sent them without her knowing and did sexual things on th eoffice
[2:33:29] <+BigBlackBankai> LASO runs are taping a sticker to your screen getting a plasma pistol and headshot weapon and meleeing occasionally
[2:33:38] <%Dean_Inbetween> Woolie experiencing the games on his own i bet changes his views significantly
[2:33:47] <malcobraaklynny> anyway, Halo
[2:33:48] <Explodincatz> welcome to the Halo meta, headshot or why bother
[2:33:55] <%ZeroCruz> The Adam stuff hurt because to me he was the weird dad from the news.
[2:34:02] <+JustToWatch> "So I did some grinding off-screen"
[2:34:09] <RickSaintRiot> lol
[2:34:30] <OldManDeckardCain> would be crazy, huh
[2:34:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:34:34] <derap41> I've seen people learning Guitar on stream its terrible
[2:34:40] <PrideOfFiddles> That guitar stream was educational for everyone :
[2:34:40] <%D00msDayDan> If only he’d give kbm this kind of lab time instead of 30 minutes on a stream with a difficult game
[2:34:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Lessons Learned: Don't fuck fans and never put anyone on a pedestal.
[2:34:42] <PrideOfFiddles> :)
[2:34:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> sounds insane who would do that? lol
[2:35:00] <+BigBlackBankai> V and Woolie should Vidmaster Endure
[2:35:12] <%Dean_Inbetween> You didn’t grow up on fps’s woolie it’s understandable, i bet your thoughts on these games will be deeper down the line and more refined ItsHappening <3
[2:35:13] <RickSaintRiot> watching Woolie gradually improve on FPS games is frustrating in the short term, but it's really enjoyable in the long term
[2:35:16] <rytisone> I remember Lyle Mcdouchebag's video "Shredding made easy"
[2:35:22] <derap41> Applying Knowledge and Absorbing Knowledge
[2:35:44] <StarlitStunner> Back when Lyle used to be GuitarMaster
[2:35:52] <RickSaintRiot> and "frustrating" is a strong word. very very mild. it's interesting
[2:35:54] <%Dean_Inbetween> Im just glad you gave them a chance and made one of my wishes for years come true @woolieversus and the fact you like them is all the better ItsHappening <3
[2:36:07] <derap41> no understanding of game Tropes
[2:36:41] <%Aeriqui> i just realized i'm literally wearing the same combo breaker hoodie as woolie right now
[2:36:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> Your foot is in the door and thats what matters FrankerZ <3
[2:37:12] <%Lion_kun> But it has baby mode
[2:37:25] <+BigBlackBankai> Woolie needs to become FPS Doug.
[2:37:28] <subjectg> learning is an inherent part of vidya
[2:37:44] <andre11dr> But also decision making
[2:37:44] <Vadrigar1994> What game is this?
[2:37:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> Learning is Fun
[2:37:46] <%Javaa01> Also, the whole story of Hades really doesn't work if you do the easy mode, the repetition is baked in to the narrative
[2:37:47] <Baziiiinga> Everytime easy mode for anything is mentioned: Woolie: Is there? -peaked interest-
[2:37:48] <%Dean_Inbetween> Also woolie did legitimately get really good at doom towards the end i was impressed
[2:37:48] <Tuna_Can_0> idk I couldnt play fps from a couch, or a controller. so kudos to wools
[2:37:50] <subjectg> you’re not gonna have fun if you don’t want to learn
[2:37:54] <+kewlmyc> Little V was a teacher?
[2:38:05] <RickSaintRiot> the fact that Woolz knows Games, just not These games, makes it a unique experience too
[2:38:24] <RickSaintRiot> it's fascinating to see what he gets right away and what takes time
[2:38:28] <vulkan_vibes> HEAD EMPTY
[2:38:34] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yeah for me its just second nature
[2:38:38] <derap41> And that stuff carries over to other FPS games
[2:38:45] <@Solidus_113> fundies
[2:38:47] <%Dean_Inbetween> but admittedly woolie did learn well
[2:38:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Multiplayer is a whole different set of skills by the way
[2:38:56] <Explodincatz> farm that muscle memory
[2:38:58] <@Menitta> I find it when someone who never plays video games playing them fascinating
[2:38:58] <AMaidIndeed> Hey wanna learn the Guitar... Again?! :D
[2:39:06] <vulkan_vibes> play kid Buu and you can win!
[2:39:07] <andre11dr> Decision making is very important in Hades, you technically can beat the game with a non op built, but it's way harder
[2:39:12] <RickSaintRiot> Right. We only have so many hours in the day.
[2:39:27] <%Dean_Inbetween> Yeah playing a pardox grand strategy game is already a nightmare learning it in multiplayer is an entirely different abomination
[2:39:35] <subjectg> One of the other big hurdles for learning fighting games is not having a human sparring partner you can just play casually with
[2:39:42] <+Gamblitz> has woolie played the dead space series already?
[2:39:55] <%Dean_Inbetween> @menitta as long as its not girlfriend reviews LUL ugh
[2:40:15] <derap41> Smoke on the Water
[2:40:17] <RickSaintRiot> that's the only real prob with "get good" as a pat response
[2:40:23] <derap41> And fire in the sky
[2:40:33] <RickSaintRiot> we don't have infinite time TO get good at every game, even if we really wanted to
[2:40:35] <AMaidIndeed> I don't need these call outs V!!!!!
[2:40:38] <rytisone> but she had big boobs
[2:40:38] <Tuna_Can_0> V says that like its a bad thing Kappa
[2:40:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pat?
[2:40:50] <+BigBlackBankai> Pat?
[2:40:51] <ashenchevalierthesecond> This is all reminding me that I should have been doing some guitar/singing practice and I completely forgot NotLikeThis
[2:40:54] <+condemned_15> jesus
[2:41:01] <@Menitta> Oh wow yeah you gotta be good at that shit
[2:41:08] <%stayinthepocket> Are you talking about my ex?
[2:41:12] <$RunningNGunning> Being good at school basically
[2:41:16] <+wunp_fxs> The Light!
[2:41:19] <+Gamblitz> human robots
[2:41:20] <%Dean_Inbetween> I have that problem with fighting games like i can totally get the physical shit down but learning on the fly like woolie can takes me big time @woolieversus
[2:41:22] <+condemned_15> I dont want that person doing surgery on me
[2:41:22] <PredatorKev> Good book smarts, bit no common sense
[2:41:24] <+getinthetent> damn I'm the opposite, can't study for shit

[2:41:32] <subjectg> anatomy and physiology has a lotta things you need to memorize

[2:41:48] <%Mr_Strut> godrays
[2:41:48] <@Solidus_113> LittleV is literally blending into the wall
[2:41:54] <Tuna_Can_0> CoolCat
[2:41:59] <+NotSafeForPBS> Noodling is in drawing too, but it was taught to me to mean re drawing over lines to cover the imprecision/inaccuracy
[2:42:02] <%Dean_Inbetween> MICROSOFT SIGN MY DIVORCE
[2:42:07] <+nanaboof> bro this mans just got 400% cooler
[2:42:18] <subjectg> XBOX PAY MY CHILD SUPPORT
[2:42:25] <@Menitta> I googled "Xbox save my marriage" and only found a headline of "To save their marriage, they shot his xbox with a gun"
[2:42:28] <RickSaintRiot> "Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect" as my sensei would say.
[2:42:35] <+getinthetent> yo how did you get a rockstar to stream with you?
[2:42:45] <%ChoculaUltra> Orbital Drop Somber Team FeelsBadMan
[2:42:54] <derap41> Its the equivalent of lying under a warm blanket while it rains
[2:43:01] <NobleBalor> Xbox, bring my wife back, please, please Xbox I want to see my kids
[2:43:15] <derap41> Not the gameplay that's at issue
[2:43:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Chasing that Call of Duty audience
[2:43:29] <subjectg> Xbox, this is not my beautiful house
[2:43:42] <%stayinthepocket> @canadiananimatorguy Nice meme.
[2:43:48] <%Dean_Inbetween> Thanks for trying these games out, It felt like a treat for one of my favorite entertainers finally enjoying what i grew up and seeing my childhood <3

[2:43:54] <Halospaz117> That Jedi comparison is actually really on point
[2:44:13] <+JustToWatch> I understood that reference
[2:44:28] <Halospaz117> "We are the ones undercooking these deals!"
[2:44:31] <+Gamblitz> are engineers even sapient?
[2:44:36] <Shade075> The Drones want the Engineers dead instead

[2:47:09] <%Terrarp> Everyone loves Linkin Park, eventually
[2:47:11] <Halospaz117> Being a teenager fucking sucked because it's just your brain convincing you everything you like is lame
[2:47:24] <%Dean_Inbetween> marty loves thats shit
[2:47:27] <Akett> I never went through the hate everything phase.
[2:47:28] <%ChoculaUltra> basically all 00-10s pop punk is solid, unless they're one of the many bands who got outted for doing creeper shit to teenagers which is also like 70% of 00s-10s pop punk frontmen LUL
[2:47:31] <%Dean_Inbetween> I bet that was his idea
[2:47:33] <+BigBlackBankai> BIBBLE
[2:47:35] <@Solidus_113> is that a... Bibble?
[2:47:36] <+nanaboof> your brain does that because it makes you want to be like everyone else during that time in your teenage years

[2:47:47] <Halospaz117> Congratulations!
[2:48:02] <+nanaboof> as time goes though, your mind starts to realize that it was just a terrible idea it had back then
[2:48:04] <RickSaintRiot> no. i do not want to tell him about the still unsolved easter egg from ODST.
[2:48:06] <derap41> ...wat

[2:49:28] <andresisant> Alligator new yersey it´s a thing ?
[2:49:37] <andresisant> *jersey sorry
[2:49:38] <%ChoculaUltra> BG3 is great.
[2:49:47] <derap41> Waiting for it to be finished
[2:49:54] <%ChoculaUltra> Divinity 2 is also great if you want a finished game that won't explode.
[2:50:07] <@Solidus_113> save files will very much get fucked on patches
[2:50:09] <RickSaintRiot> they're rude little boys, but we like a good Baldur's Gate, so we'll see
[2:50:09] <@Menitta> its directly based on 5E right
[2:50:12] <majindusto> It's just D&D
[2:50:18] <%gnoame> Good idea, multiplayer is JANK atm
[2:50:21] <%Dean_Inbetween> @menitta ye
[2:50:22] <%ChoculaUltra> @Menitta all 5E everything
[2:50:24] <%Terrarp> Just like Black Mesa was for a lot of years
[2:50:25] <derap41> Its going to be great so why ruin it by popping of early
[2:50:33] <RickSaintRiot> it is now, since Forgotten Realms is the new default for D&D
[2:50:36] <PrideOfFiddles> Take care everyone & have a wonderful day!
[2:50:43] <%Javaa01> Their current timeline is that the game is gonna be done in about a year
[2:50:49] <@Menitta> YEYEYE KIRBY FIGHTER
[2:50:50] <%ChoculaUltra> an attempted multiplayer session in BG3 last night blue screened one of my friends and froze the rest of us LUL

[2:52:11] <@Menitta> but i dont have a job

[2:52:42] <+duskrush> This part. What RPG is this?
[2:52:46] <RickSaintRiot> Halo RPG
[2:53:01] <+duskrush> yeah what RPG was that with the "Guts' mother was less high strung" joke
[2:53:12] <%Josef_Stryker> Ahagao Academy
[2:53:16] <@Menitta> that was Ahegao Academy, the fan made SBFP VN

[2:53:58] <%Josef_Stryker> BITCH SAVE
[2:54:04] <%YakumoYomi> BITCH SAVE
[2:54:14] <%Terrarp> Was Infinite supposed to be the Halo MMO?
[2:54:19] <derap41> This is tickling my brain in the nices way
[2:54:20] <%ChoculaUltra> If you paid $12.99 a month for an Amazon Prime membership, for a whole year, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years combined :)
[2:54:22] <%Josef_Stryker> SHUT. THE FUCK. UP.
[2:54:44] <%Dean_Inbetween> @terrarp no, ensemble was workimg for years on one before halo wars
