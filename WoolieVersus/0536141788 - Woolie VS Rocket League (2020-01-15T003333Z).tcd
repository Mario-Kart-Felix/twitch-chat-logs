[0:41:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> so let's do this
[0:41:56] <Solidnick18> you have to
[0:41:57] <0rond> focus on staying in the air for now

[0:43:25] <bleugh> it's just chemistry
[0:43:26] <0rond> I think it will lift you if you actually straighen it up and not wobble
[0:43:29] <+MeMillionthDollar> moon gravity on? lol
[0:43:34] <%RioGascar> 9.8 m/s ^2
[0:43:35] <+Javaa01> It can, if you can control it

[1:18:24] <+Javaa01> That's a feature of the arena
[1:18:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus every arena generally has it's own unique mechanics or gimmicks
[1:18:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> tmk
[1:19:01] <arkv01> I can feel this channel becoming real esports by the minute

[1:20:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> Feel Yourself? Here? Now? quiettThonk
[1:20:24] <T_Sasquatch> Chasing the ball seems like a bad idea
[1:20:54] <masterfire23> i can't believe they made a game based on lucioball mechanics Kappa
[1:21:16] <%MeAuntieNora> Yeah eventually you realize the ball cam isn't always the best move, but that's probably a preference thing
[1:21:28] <T_Sasquatch> Pick your moments to go after it or you'll just be driving around constantly
[1:21:40] <%MeAuntieNora> dangit
[1:22:08] <bevyrage> depending on position
[1:22:21] <bevyrage> you can also net a three second goal if you use MAX SPEED strats

[1:27:54] <foreverN2dust> it's not real rocket league till someone gets salty in the in game chat

[1:41:36] <gridib> Woolz, you should flip forwards more. To build speed and hit the ball harder. Flip into the ball. Less double jumps

[2:01:33] <@Solidus_113> if you're really cool you could try getting a goal in reverse

[2:01:41] <foreverN2dust> there is a button for aerial control
[2:01:51] <foreverN2dust> if you want to tilt and yaw
[2:01:54] <Philza> the struggle
[2:01:55] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Fiull speed and front flip at the start. gives you sruface area to bump the ball even if you dont reach it first
[2:01:59] <Prevot> woolie is not paying attention to boost at all

[2:03:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> i left and reggie still has a 4 point lead
[2:03:06] <Philza> hes got the right idea chat
[2:03:13] <worldbrand> i believe
[2:03:15] <%The_Timo> You just have to be more deliberate with your dodge
[2:03:18] <Philza> going in the air before knowing how to drive is a no go

[2:05:34] <%mh9s> i'd 8-2 be woolie right now

[2:16:40] <Solidnick18> learned what?
[2:16:41] <worldbrand> reggie is doing a thingy where he takes the camera off the ball that woolie needs to learn
[2:16:45] <+tokageturtle> strats
[2:16:45] <+NammyBabs> holy shit this is so intense
[2:16:45] <foreverN2dust> tutorials will help immensely
[2:16:46] <bevyrage> they both did splendidly though
[2:16:47] <StuffHunter> Learning and applying in this game is very satisfying.
[2:16:52] <bevyrage> four goals!
[2:16:56] <+twig_blight> If you're driving, it will be faster in a straight line you should flip
[2:16:58] <Xelhesia> hey you forced them into overtime on your first game. GOOD JOB
[2:17:03] <SixthSun2> Ooooh, winter stadium
[2:17:07] <SaltMaestro> Yea, turning off ball cam is crucial to actually positioning yourself properly
[2:17:14] <@Solidus_113> 3v3 is the norm
[2:17:26] <mrlastchance1> Is woolie a pro rocket leaguer?
[2:17:33] <%The_Timo> Said this already Woolz, Just try to get used to dodging in directions and using boost to get where you need to be
[2:17:34] <WaffleTree> lol
[2:18:12] <Solidnick18> oh
[2:18:32] <WaffleTree> they know you can jump twice right
[2:18:40] <bevyrage> they do but woolie is a bit scared
[2:18:41] <%MeAuntieNora> Nice redirect

[2:20:36] <Solidnick18> air boost is the next step
[2:20:41] <NaturalGear> yeah, you have to think of it as targeting and untargeting in Dark Souls
[2:20:45] <Solidnick18> OH
[2:20:45] <worldbrand> whew
[2:20:46] <@Solidus_113> flipping forward is free speed
[2:20:47] <Solidnick18> almost
[2:20:51] <+skm742> I haven't played much rocket league, but would it be good advice to new players to not think of themselves as a player, and more of a pool cue? Because it seems that the biggest learning curve at the start is learning to stay away from the ball to set up shots.
[2:20:53] <WaffleTree> it's like watching your kids grow up
[2:21:00] <+BigBruthaThunda> Need Boost!
[2:21:10] <%MeAuntieNora> @NaturalGear that's a really good analogy. Usually it's good but sometimes it's not

[2:22:16] <Solidnick18> BUT!
[2:22:18] <StuffHunter> @skm742 Mostly! A big part of the obviously is where you hit the ball and how hard, so I guess it's like controlling a flying cue.

[2:26:28] <SaltMaestro> @skm472 The most important skill in Rocket League is positioning, hands down. You can have the technical skills of a paraplegic coma patient, but so long as you put yourself in the proper place at the right time, you can make critical plays.
[2:26:40] <+skm742> @StuffHunter Oh, I'm fully aware this game goes crazy places, I'm just always interested in finding ways to teach new players how to play different genres. Rocket League is interesting because it's really unique
[2:27:11] <Solidnick18> to the goal
[2:27:32] <%MeAuntieNora> off the post
[2:27:37] <+Dioliciouss> RL, one of my favorite (unexpected) games ever

[2:28:08] <NaturalGear> #carried tomatoReally
[2:28:22] <BearSawed> Whiff
[2:28:25] <SoySocks> car tripped
[2:28:42] <BearSawed> Such whiff many wow
[2:28:43] <+skm742> @SaltMaestro That's what I was thinking. I think it may help new players to try to re-contextualize their role in the match from a 'person' controlling the ball to something that plans positioning for a prepared hit.
[2:29:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> "fine"
[2:29:16] <@Solidus_113> WEHITDOES

[2:30:35] <BearSawed> Is it wrong I want like nba jam announcers for this?
[2:30:44] <SaltMaestro> @skm742 Yea exactly! I've seen people who can't hit aerial balls at all get really high in the ranking system solely because they know where to put themselves on the field at all times
[2:30:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:30:51] <%MeAuntieNora> almost cool

[2:33:20] <Prevot> woolie needs to flip into the ball more
[2:33:21] <+Javaa01> B-Ball is in
[2:33:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> drop ball
[2:33:21] <Jathspuh> HOOPS
[2:33:22] <DDDorsett> Dropshot
[2:33:23] <Solidnick18> hockey i think
[2:33:24] <WaffleTree> hoops
[2:33:25] <Xelhesia> BASKETBALL
[2:33:25] <DDDorsett> Rumble
[2:33:25] <gridib> Try Rumble
[2:33:28] <Xelhesia> HOCKEY
[2:33:33] <zenith0111> HOCKEY

[2:33:34] <Quietshun13> is that spike game still there
[2:33:37] <@Solidus_113> remove ball, enter puck
[2:33:40] <Philza> rumble is a lot of fun
[2:33:40] <Prozmbieeater> 2v2 is fun too
[2:33:40] <+BigBruthaThunda> oh yeah Hockey, very little jumping needed
[2:33:43] <Solidnick18> hockey is very fun
[2:33:48] <StuffHunter> @bevyrage To be fair, own-goaling is synonymous with first learning Rocket League :P
[2:33:56] <bevyrage> true
[2:33:58] <Philza> its just rocket league with items LUL
[2:34:06] <+twig_blight> Dropshot is better if you can do the basics of flight
[2:34:07] <DDDorsett> Basketball is Probably too much at this skill level
[2:34:18] <DDDorsett> Same with Dropshot
[2:34:21] <WaffleTree> ya but itll be funny
[2:34:28] <%MeAuntieNora> well done
[2:34:29] <Xelhesia> GOOD SAVE
[2:34:48] <dekkitout> Are ya feelin it now Mr. Krabs?
[2:35:01] <StuffHunter> Yeah, Hockey is good for learning positioning, Drop Shot and Hoops are good for learning aerial movement.
[2:35:01] <Josef_Stryker> LUL

[2:37:57] <Kiraklene> big choke
[2:37:59] <DDDorsett> OOO
[2:37:59] <SoySocks> your best bet in a sitch like that is to just get between it and the goal
[2:38:11] <bevyrage> yeah a side-flip would have been the best option at that time
[2:38:17] <worldbrand> ok
[2:38:18] <Arek_1> It didn't matter if Woolie made that goal. In an instant he exceeded my expectations and did beautifully.
[2:38:22] <Kiraklene> ahahah they did it for you
[2:38:24] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Xelhesia

[2:54:34] <+Javaa01> Yeah, the music comes in during intermissions in matches
[2:54:39] <$Walopoh> That's what I do
[2:54:56] <+Jetzord> It's like being a kid and having to play with only one goal because the big kids took over the other side
[2:55:03] <Solidnick18> or that's just online
[2:55:06] <+Rustyoak> How do you play on the these maps
[2:55:27] <Philza> this map is a shit show haha
[2:55:45] <+twig_blight> @Rustyoak They're in private game options, it's the old experimental maps set

[2:56:42] <Solidnick18> this map is something else
[2:56:43] <AmericanaRed> find out on the next episode
[2:56:44] <bevyrage> this map is notorious for zero goals overtime
[2:56:49] <Solidnick18> let me tell you
[2:57:01] <bevyrage> i think it's removed form esports playlists
[2:57:06] <NeroInfinite> Nobody likes this map for that reason
[2:57:12] <bevyrage> because it's a ten+ minute game
[2:57:16] <bevyrage> with one goal
[2:57:23] <NeroInfinite> And yeah esports playlists don't have this.
[2:57:30] <Xelhesia> just like real soccer
[2:57:31] <StuffHunter> 0-0 Overtime!
[2:57:36] <+twig_blight> Anyone else remember that three lane monstrosity map?
[2:57:50] <NeroInfinite> finally a goal
[2:57:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Booooo
[2:57:50] <bevyrage> that's game
[2:58:00] <bevyrage> get lucky
[2:58:17] <%mh9s> woolie doesnt have enough BELIEF
[2:58:31] <NaturalGear> feel like this map is better suited for a 2v2
[2:58:41] <+Jetzord> @Xelhesia I hate that you're right
[2:58:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> If you go through their goal, you'll come out yours facing the attackers.
[2:58:48] <$Walopoh> @WoolieVersus You can turn on music while playing in the settings btw. that's what I do on low volume
[2:58:54] <StuffHunter> I do like these experimental maps. They good for exactly this.

[3:15:04] <SoySocks> drop shot is a whole new mindset
[3:15:22] <Jathspuh> This mode is super fun
[3:15:29] <alpacapologist> in da floor wraxuSip_SQ
[3:15:32] <SoySocks> @WoolieVersus infinite regen boost, slap the ball onto their side
[3:16:14] <KaliasTV> You're making holes in the floor, glowing ball damages a larger area
[3:16:15] <masterfire23> is this splatoon rocket league
[3:16:32] <+BigBruthaThunda> drop ball Kappa
[3:16:35] <McButtz109> splatocket league
[3:16:48] <SoySocks> when the ball is your team's color, it won't hurt your side
[3:16:54] <bevyrage> oh a hole opens up for the ball to drop in
[3:17:17] <SoySocks> you're creating your own hole in teh floor to act as a goal
[3:17:28] <gridib> @WoolieVersus You weaken the floor to make a goal hole. Hit the same area
[3:18:00] <PlainSimpleTailor> Ball go down da hoooooooole
[3:18:05] <SoySocks> the floor tiles can take a couple of hits before falling away
[3:18:13] <bevyrage> tiles that get selected twice in the AoE fall out of the floor
[3:18:38] <DedlokPM> I knew Reggie was a weeb. rooOWO
[3:18:38] <Jathspuh> Jebaited
[3:18:41] <SoySocks> the harder the ball hits the floor, the further the shockwave damages tiles
[3:18:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's called defense woolie
[3:19:11] <gridib> @WoolieVersus Damage from the previous round also carries over for the team that scored. The team that got scored on gets a new floor.
[3:19:12] <%SuttonsGaming> LuL
[3:19:15] <%SuttonsGaming> own goal
[3:19:25] <%blink289> its breakout
[3:19:27] <bevyrage> oh that's a good balance
[3:19:31] <%blink289> plus soccer cars
[3:19:55] <%Triforce505> are they playing online?
[3:20:02] <maxpasta> Is this still a private match?
[3:20:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1214757122967318529?s=19
[3:20:23] <SoySocks> yeah they're playing online private matches
[3:20:33] <maxpasta> @soysocks thanks
[3:20:34] <SoySocks> room is: Versus password is: 1
[3:20:44] <bevyrage> snipe doesn't work too well on rocket league due to the delay
[3:21:09] <KaliasTV> For a password lobby not so difficult though
[3:21:10] <+Truebluemc> i dont think ball speed plays a factor in damage. The more touches you make before dealing damage, the more tiles you break
[3:21:13] <SoySocks> your stream is 10-15 seconds behind actual play, so don't worry about sniping in this kind of game
[3:21:17] <gridib> Give rumble a try
[3:21:17] <Philza> dropshot is kinda hard
[3:21:24] <%blink289> hoops is air combos

[3:21:28] <zenith0111> HOOP DAR IT IS

[3:50:59] <Solidnick18> super patato i guess

[3:51:53] <Solidnick18> is that a thing sagit?
[3:51:55] <@Menitta> Dont litter anywhere

[3:51:59] <BulletFodder80> I believe it
[3:52:00] <%chronoxgp> im terrified of japan they speak in moon runes
[3:52:02] <Djinnazz> @BulletFodder80 Boy*
[3:52:04] <%mh9s> don't litter, but only in Japan tho
[3:52:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidnick18 yes
[3:52:12] <%Irridium> And you will be a an asshole
[3:52:14] <chaos2frozen> Did it stop Pat?
[3:52:15] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[3:52:19] <%sporeian94> My hotel is in Ginza area so I figured that area and this place nearby called the sinodme or something like that would be the first day
[3:52:21] <Misstrixtin> the showers only go up to your chest there
[3:52:23] <+QueequegTheater> But why would I ever leave the Midwest
[3:52:25] <Solidnick18> i wanna go then
[3:52:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> https://www.shinjukustation.com/hotel-gracery-shinjuku/
[3:52:29] <chaos2frozen> If it stopped Pat, it'll stop most people from littering
[3:52:32] <+QueequegTheater> Pizza in other places sucks
[3:52:35] <NaturalGear> Pat is public enemy in Japan
[3:52:36] <Dhurkst> you don't have that barrier of "it's okay for me to do it, because other people are"
[3:52:47] <Misstrixtin> what i would give to experience a japanese toilet Kreygasm
[3:52:51] <Philza> LUL
[3:52:55] <ha2ken> Pat never littered in Japan. He said he only litters locally because he pays for those people to clean up the litter.
[3:52:57] <+rawblink> i may be going to japan with amusic group i work with in late may, im a little worried about the language barrier but we'll be in a group most of the time and on my free days i definitely want to go to arcades and retro game stores
[3:53:03] <+QueequegTheater> I'll go to Japan when they have a Lou Malnati's
