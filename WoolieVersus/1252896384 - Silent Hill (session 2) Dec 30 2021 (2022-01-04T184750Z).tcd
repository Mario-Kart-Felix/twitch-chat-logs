[0:02:54] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie can't stop bringing up the Matrix Kappa
[0:02:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> confirmed better than a movie that was marketed wrong
[0:02:57] <+cdrom321> "Don't Look at My Balls"
[0:03:00] <brunoberserk> is a more serious and tragic version of   idiocracy
[0:03:03] <%dds333a> @hereiam407 good recommend

[0:04:07] <%Noonoox12> shits fucked
[0:04:08] <+anoldtoilet> @spaghettiweaver i think the people who made it said it was about climate change

[0:04:12] <Puhff> the last 2 he says LUL
[0:04:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I guess logic and reality are debatable now lol
[0:04:14] <%MoreCaffeinePlease> You talking about Pat right?
[0:04:15] <dundore77> but last 2 especially
[0:04:18] <spaghettiweaver> oh

[0:04:44] <+Shady_Zaku> what're we talking about?
[0:04:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> this is why we need warning labels, because of these people lol
[0:04:57] <dundore77> whats the title again? just joined in
[0:04:57] <%ThePich> Idiocracy but depressing
[0:05:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not as easy going, this movie is more of a punch to your mental state
[0:05:00] <%dds333a> I try not to think I'm smarter than I actually am for that reason
[0:05:03] <%hereiam407> Dont Look Up is the title
[0:05:04] <+anoldtoilet> Don't Look Up
[0:05:06] <+anoldtoilet> is the movie
[0:05:19] <+Shady_Zaku> aah okay
[0:05:23] <Puhff> Except Idiocracy actually ends happily while Don't Look Up kiils everyone lol
[0:05:27] <Frampis> Just watched it with my parents yesterday, was a solid movie to watch with parents
[0:05:29] <%leith_aziz> Well, thanks Woolie pickyPalm
[0:05:30] <+Shady_Zaku> Still gotta see Idiocracy lol
[0:05:32] <slackerunchained> THIS is about how stupid humanity is NOW
[0:05:34] <Frampis> and reminded me of Idiocracy a lot
[0:05:54] <+illusiveSaint> Idiocracy is so good i might like this movie
[0:05:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's stupidty in the future vs stupidity now
[0:05:56] <%dds333a> bless you Kappa
[0:05:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ehhh Idiocracy has a pretty shitty portrayal of poor people and why these systemic issues fail rather than the individual
[0:05:59] <+terraspan> There’s no person out of time. This is now.
[0:06:06] <leomuratore> Dumb leaders will actively lead us to demise
[0:06:08] <%mongorific> David Sirota is a king
[0:06:18] <%hereiam407> Pampered baby leaders
[0:06:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:06:19] <%Necnill> Valid observation
[0:06:21] <Wyldesquirrel> One of the greatest successes and failures of power structures, is their resilience to actual change
[0:06:22] <%ThePich> Don't Look Up made me want to learn how to make anthrax
[0:06:24] <%zanz_san> That's straight up LoGH
[0:06:27] <+anoldtoilet> idiocracy has issues yeah but it is definitely also aimed at the powerful
[0:06:28] <mikesapartment> thank you woolie vs films
[0:06:32] <randomdude365> Yes that is exactly it
[0:06:35] <+illusiveSaint> we hold ourselves back thanks to conformity
[0:06:36] <%hereiam407> @ThePich Hmmm, what watch list are you on now?
[0:06:37] <depressioncherrie> It me
[0:06:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @thepich issa joke FBI I swear
[0:06:43] <nailwind> LoGH had big themes of this
[0:06:45] <+conqab> it's more that the ones in power think we're the dumb the ones
[0:06:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> you could say that
[0:06:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> why is everybody laughing but me
[0:07:00] <%dds333a> @thepich going full Ted Kracyzinki LUL
[0:07:01] <+DatAsuna> the funniest thing politicians and media not getting that the film is  about them
[0:07:04] <%leith_aziz> Allthough you can choose to ignore those in power. That's how some cultures work in some poorer countries, and the people inside those places can be pretty nice
[0:07:07] <+Jiggisnipe> hey remember Disaster Movie? Kappa
[0:07:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieVS FILM
[0:07:12] <leomuratore> Its has pinpoint accurate depictions of people and things happening in many countries.
[0:07:13] <+ClericOfSparda> I keep hearing it was mediocre
[0:07:21] <%hereiam407> @leith_aziz I try every day, but its so hard to forget
[0:07:27] <spaghettiweaver> @WoolieVersus for my self I only got covid parallels out of it nothing about climate change
[0:07:32] <+illusiveSaint> "fuck it dawg just live your life"
[0:07:32] <andre11dr> We should get a movie review every stream
[0:07:32] <depressioncherrie> They have been saying this shit since the 70s. Club of Rome propaganda being rehashed for 50 years
[0:07:36] <randomdude365> The only unrealistic part is the plan to extract resources would be the first thing they do
[0:07:40] <majindusto> What Movie  are we talking  about?
[0:07:47] <leomuratore> Don't look up
[0:07:48] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:07:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhh climate denier in the chat
[0:07:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> a choice quote i saw about this movie was "don't look up is the god isn't dead but for people who throw drinks at barista
[0:07:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> this will be fun lol
[0:08:06] <andre11dr> Green Pie Media staring Woolie
[0:08:11] <+Jiggisnipe> he can't stop with the Matrix lol
[0:08:13] <%FallenAngelZelos> one of those your mileage may vary movies
[0:08:20] <Puhff> In reality, China would have made a giant laser and blown the comet up before it ever became a problem
[0:08:24] <@Moobot> @Rose_Silvers WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 24 minutes and 48 seconds
[0:08:24] <+Rose_Silvers> !uptime
[0:08:30] <+xiomyu> doodOne
[0:08:37] <%JetpackMcQuack> show it to your kids
[0:08:37] <+DatAsuna> the problem is the people it's about will learn nothing if they watch it
[0:08:41] <%ThePich> Ciuf ciuf HypeHai
[0:08:44] <Puhff> "the world" he says
[0:08:44] <%dds333a> one more? LUL
[0:08:49] <Puhff> nah dude, just the West
[0:08:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> unless... Kappa
[0:08:54] <%MoreCaffeinePlease> HypeHai
[0:08:56] <yukichocomilk> there could be meteors falling on our heads and there would still be deniers
[0:09:04] <miucsa51> so basically dr strange love but for clilate change the?
[0:09:09] <%leith_aziz> If you enjoyed a movie and have things you wanna talk about it afterwards, that's what matters at the end of the day, no? So I say Woolie talking about this movie is a pretty good sign
[0:09:12] <allowmoreusernames> what movie?
[0:09:17] <%dds333a> Kappa Kappa
[0:09:22] <%hereiam407> Dont Look Up
[0:09:25] <+kinmarik> yup we had some close calls
[0:09:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> why would you go off alone stacey
[0:09:26] <+extradopeness> so fat the main detractors of this movie have all been Bad Take People on Twitter
[0:09:28] <+Dirty_Dandere> Don't Look Up is the movie
[0:09:30] <Puhff> @miucsa51 not nearly as funny or clever but same feel, yeah
[0:09:31] <mikesapartment> aaaaaaaaa play game
[0:09:34] <+extradopeness> so far*
[0:09:35] <spaghettiweaver> I did
[0:09:43] <fairore> lol
[0:09:44] <heartlesshealer> videochessNerves
[0:09:48] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz depending LUL
[0:09:55] <+illusiveSaint> it's about how society reacts to disaster period
[0:09:55] <+alekto989_m31> @mikesapartment They will when they want to.
[0:09:57] <miucsa51> @puhff i might look at it
[0:09:59] <leomuratore> @miucsa51 It has a lot of parallels to how countries delt with the pandemic ad well
[0:10:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @mikesapartment we still havent got to Rollback talk yet LUL
[0:10:05] <%leith_aziz> So it's a documentary
[0:10:06] <leomuratore> as well*
[0:10:07] <+DatAsuna> dave sarota knows writers who use subtext and they're all cowards
[0:10:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> Kinda like "I'm Sorry to Bother You"
[0:10:08] <%leith_aziz> That's fine
[0:10:11] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:10:13] <+anoldtoilet> yeah i think thats basically the main crit ive seen of it, is that the entire movie is keenan ivory wayans popping into the window to yell MESSAGE!
[0:10:15] <%hereiam407> @Th3SmartAlec Could you not
[0:10:15] <+Jiggisnipe> so it was made by Kojima Kappa
[0:10:16] <+BananaSlammuh> It sounds like it could be any social issue that is clearly bad for the human race
[0:10:17] <%dds333a> COWARDS
[0:10:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember, 2 weeks ago in america in south dakato they made teachers fight and crawl in a dirt pile for single dollar bills in an arena for a bunch of people trying to make it a feel good story @WoolieVersus
[0:10:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> hopefully it works

[0:10:35] <%hereiam407> The Strands stand for Climate Change
[0:10:37] <Puhff> Fun Fact: Leo Dicaprio still uses private jets to travel despite air travel being a major contributor to climate change
[0:10:38] <mortificent> I think Sorry to Bother You is better cause it kinda offers a solution

[0:10:55] <chimeraxmachina> @captainpiledriver that video fucked me uppppp
[0:10:57] <%JeoDood> people are dumb even when told directly still wont understand

[0:15:36] <majindusto> Sonic is good tho...Especially anything  that Isn't  the Games
[0:15:38] <%hereiam407> Shadow is just Vergil
[0:15:38] <mortificent> nah, at least Twilight is honest about being smut/fantasy of the writer

[0:15:57] <GhostRavens> @dinnydanny777 Yes
[0:15:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie went off and spoke truths
[0:15:59] <amcq99> Christian parents hate harry potter though. It has REAL WITCHCRAFT
[0:15:59] <OldManDeckardCain> harry potter movie logic: we had to cut out a lot of content to make the movie not last 5 hours, but we also added a pointless scene that has Harry flirting with a waitress that wasn't in the books LUL
[0:16:00] <%leith_aziz> I think Sonic games are good as an outsider. But DAMN are there soem trashfires among teh bad
[0:16:00] <%espanishcanamurciana> Omg the sonic Christian fandom lol
[0:16:02] <Puhff> @Puhff A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Guin off the top of my head
[0:16:04] <Kingw3> Didn’t Sonic say “damn” in Adventure 2 Battle 😂
[0:16:09] <%livlinn> woolieFUN
[0:16:10] <%BignanasTheGawd> But what about Gex
[0:16:10] <%hereiam407> Sonic fandom creeps me out
[0:16:11] <andre11dr> Also a lot of people discovering themselves with Sonic......
[0:16:12] <Kingw3> No that was Shadow 😂
[0:16:14] <+anoldtoilet> shadow is epic i love him. i cant believe Evil Sonic With A Gun is a real canon character
[0:16:18] <%leith_aziz> So I think Sonic fans are justified. The fandom though is a different subject
[0:16:24] <oneimportantthing> "In my restless dreams, I see that town... Maddentown"
[0:16:24] <+DatAsuna> then there's the sonic boom zoomer generation who enjoy it as a comedy
[0:16:25] <+invalid_robin> I feel the same way about the MCU
[0:16:28] <amcq99> Naruto is also normie shit let's not kid ourselves
[0:16:29] <+Shady_Zaku> @Puhff OH! Wasn't that Ghibli movie based on that series?
[0:16:31] <leomuratore> Most 2D Sonic games go from good to great
[0:16:32] <+anoldtoilet> what if sonic had a deagle (official art)
[0:16:36] <depressioncherrie> Still all of it better than MCU
[0:16:37] <@Menitta> it's so shameful how Jojo Part 3 ripped off Sonic Adventure 2 Kappa
[0:16:38] <wqorst> I love how woolie spent 30 minutes delicately saying why he didn't like a movie and reggie just went in on it in 3 lol

[0:16:42] <%hereiam407> God, this stream is going slower than a night at Gerry Garcias @BignanasTheGawd
[0:16:42] <dinnydanny777> Those movies only get worse :)
[0:16:43] <+Nekros4442> Fuck everything there stull isnt a better trilogy than the Lors of the Rings trilogy
[0:16:44] <Voidvas> Hold On, Spider Minkey
[0:16:44] <%leith_aziz> I actually never seen Twilight, ever
[0:16:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> was jacob cute

[0:16:47] <+FingaLights> Harry Potter is Wizard Naruto
[0:16:47] <+DatAsuna> bleach used to be but not anymore
[0:16:49] <andre11dr> But at least everyone openly mocked Twilight
[0:16:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> twilight has the weirdest thing of a grown man smelling a baby and going "i'mma fuck that"
[0:16:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> If Twilight had the genders reversed it'd be really hot tho
[0:16:55] <%lightbringrrrr> Nah HP movies are dogshit
[0:16:58] <%hereiam407> Got it, turn off stream and watch
[0:16:58] <Zeif00> Isn't Twilight having a resurgence?
[0:17:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @canadiananimatorguy PREACH
[0:17:10] <%hereiam407> @Zeif00 What?
[0:17:14] <fairore> @CaptainPileDriver bro
[0:17:14] <projectcapsule> watch it right now fuck this stream
[0:17:18] <andre11dr> Even the actors hated Twilight
[0:17:19] <+DatAsuna> "dumbledore said calmly"
[0:17:24] <%ekodrop> woolie expect to get a phone call from reggie at like 1am
[0:17:26] <miucsa51> @canadiananimatorguy that is already a thing she made a genderbend version of her own story LUL
[0:17:26] <%RigmaroleHM> RigmaroleHM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Woolie! It's always fun to see you look at older games - a lot of these are ones I've never played either.
[0:17:27] <%hereiam407> Vampire Baby
[0:17:32] <MyNameIsRasus> i want more "reggie goes off on popular thing"
[0:17:34] <mortificent> @CaptainPileDriver it's tradition with books having fucked up shit with children, like Dune
[0:17:35] <+anoldtoilet> the actors doing interviews later like "yeah i acted bad on purpose"
[0:17:38] <+anoldtoilet> incredible
[0:17:38] <brunoberserk> time for the closest thing to a kindergarten cop game ever LUL
[0:17:44] <peachy996> I don't know how you could read twilight non ironically
[0:17:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @miucsa51 WAIT WHAT LOL
[0:17:45] <Puhff> @Puhff Miyazaki's son directed a Ghibli animated Earthsea but it isn't that great. Miyazaki didn't even like it. Just generic and doesn't capture the magic
[0:17:46] <Frampis> Happy everthingstivus
[0:17:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> jacob smelled the MC's kid and was like "i'mma fuck that when it gets older"
[0:17:46] <nailwind> I live for Reggie settings things on fire
[0:18:00] <%leith_aziz> I think the good thing about some trash, simple movies is that they make you feel better about more bloated/complicated games/movies you enjoy
[0:18:02] <miucsa51> @canadiananimatorguy YEAH LOOK IR UP
[0:18:03] <peachy996> It's like taking "My Immortal" seriously

[0:30:26] <slackerunchained> Okay. If you guys just finished the school, then check the front desk. Think there's a ledger there detailing teacher adresses. You gotta visit the house of one of them. Levin Street, I think.

[0:37:31] <amcq99> I remember using the lead pipe all the time
[0:37:31] <Chatterbox1991> that's where the axe was thrown...
[0:37:34] <slackerunchained> Check the key you got
[0:37:36] <dundore77> Pennsylvania as well
[0:37:37] <%livlinn> LUL
[0:37:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> Is there an axe down there?
[0:37:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's called a Hill... but it's clearly a flat town Kappa
[0:37:42] <peachy996> I think Horror games get the best out of the Playstation 1 aesthetic
[0:37:44] <%HollowedIdjit> i don't think they're finishing that hole anytime soon
[0:37:51] <DecoyBlackmage> @Ricky_Rexx so I live in Norway, no, no you cannot reason with a moose, they are aggressive and scared at the same time all the time.......
[0:37:58] <GHouseduivel> A road that just fucking ends but somehow there is a bodega across.
[0:37:59] <%hereiam407> Murphy is just waiting for the axe to fall
[0:38:02] <slackerunchained> You can examine *some* items in your inventory.
[0:38:15] <DecoyBlackmage> @Ricky_Rexx also, literal tank on 4 legs so....Scary.... Though wild pigs are far worse !

[0:38:26] <amcq99> can you hit the birds with the pipe? I remember I can but maybe I gaslighted myself

[0:39:27] <slackerunchained> I *DO* believe that exploration has its benefits, though, as I think there are a few more items scattered about town to make up for what you used up in the School and the boss

[0:40:29] <peachy996> @andre11dr Agreed I had a dream Silent Hill that was going to take place around the woods. And it would be rainny muddy and dirty instead of rust

[0:41:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You mean The Shortcut?
[0:41:44] <%Necnill> monkaS
[0:41:47] <+kinmarik> da classic
[0:41:48] <peachy996> Last time I hopped a fence was when I had to build the fence
[0:41:48] <slackerunchained> Fun Fact: There is a quasi-stealth system in this game in the way that enemies actually react to the light, and can only see about as well as Harrry, so you can sneak up on some of them in dark locations... unfortunately, between the darkness and camera angles, it's almost impossible to properly see enemies with the lights off, so nobody ever really does that.
[0:41:48] <%Fnir> oh no
[0:41:54] <randomdude365> Hopping fences are rad
[0:41:56] <Josef_Stryker> Ouc
[0:41:56] <Mattais88> Yep
[0:41:57] <DecoyBlackmage> I was home alone when I managed to get a copy of Silent Hill 1, so I put the game in at midnight and spent the next 2 days without sleeping cause HAHAHAHAHAHA (( pal version is censored tbf, but still ))

[0:43:00] <slackerunchained> Another Fun Fact: K. Gordon here is apparenly a bit of a Weeb, as one of the rooms in here is Japanese themed and has a Katana weapon that can be looted, which is the strongest melee weapon in the game... Unfortunately, it can only be unlocked on New Game++

[0:43:35] <MyNameIsRasus> "Fanta was created during World War II in Nazi Germany by the German Coca Cola (GmbH) bottling company. Because of the war, there was no shipping between Nazi Germany and the United States. Therefore, the German bottling plant could no longer get Coca-Cola syrup."

[1:54:29] <majindusto> Woolie  is now fearful  of exiting  doors LUL
[1:54:34] <dukenux> Gawrsh, i don't like those horrors that reflect my troubled psyche one bit
[1:54:40] <+Shady_Zaku> LMFAOOOOO
[1:54:50] <Tyrdiel> GUH huh
[1:54:51] <slackerunchained> You can usually trust the radio to alert you if enemies are in the room, Woolz.
[1:54:52] <%dds333a> When I first played this, the wall texture that looks like a skull freaked me out badly
[1:54:55] <+Shady_Zaku> Fuckin BANJO soundin doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub
[1:55:01] <nailwind> Guh-huh, whatever you say
[1:55:01] <civilized_worm12> monkaS
[1:55:03] <brunoberserk> just shoot the darkness and scream

[1:55:13] <lehvak182> Reggie be feeling the spooks
[1:55:17] <+Aldra_E> Does the game become harder if you turn off the radio ?
[1:55:22] <amcq99> yep
[1:55:23] <Jahomono> banjo would do good in silent hill, backflipping onto the small buoldings and what not
[1:55:24] <dukenux> i think it's just 2-3
[1:55:26] <DrkJP520> It's a shotgun, get close.
[1:55:27] <%hereiam407> For sute
[1:55:30] <+Breaknoon> Clean Hit Sidewinder
[1:55:35] <mrpraise_> reload tho
[1:55:41] <amcq99> Banjo has issues man
[1:55:49] <+Shady_Zaku> @FallenAngelZelos Thank you clippers, doin gods work doodShake premierYo doodScrub
[1:55:49] <dukenux> in RE atleast it takes different number of bullets to take zombies down
[1:55:52] <dukenux> might be same here
[1:55:53] <%dds333a> The Chad Daughter Finder, Harry
[1:56:05] <nailwind> always knock back if somebody knocks on your bathroom stall
[1:56:08] <+Breaknoon> the guns only reload in SH1 if you fire rapidly for awhile
[1:56:28] <dukenux> steppy
[1:56:38] <dukenux> oh he liked that Kreygasm
[1:56:41] <%dds333a> Poppin docs
[1:56:45] <nailwind> right in the pimple
[1:57:08] <peachy996> Could be range dependent?
[1:57:15] <+Bitscreed> If I remember correctly they also take more damage from behind, but it's been a long time since I last played.

[1:58:18] <ry4n_c00per> i like how the camera tilts a little
[1:58:20] <Jahomono> what was the opinion on the tank controls, i wasnt here for the beginning
[1:58:26] <DrkJP520> The shotgun shoots in a spread. Get close to have as much of the spread hit the enemy and therefore cause more damage.
[1:58:30] <bleugh> might be some randomness to the damage
[1:58:38] <DSD24> These are names
[1:58:44] <%dds333a> morbid LUL
[1:58:48] <amcq99> proximity and aiming time might be related too

[1:59:23] <amcq99> Albert Lords was too cool to get old
[1:59:23] <Royvald> Just jumped onto the channel and was NOT expecting a Silent Hill stream

[2:26:43] <BlueEagle2395> as the devs intended, they want you to get cornered
[2:26:45] <+0neReeler> rng double swing
[2:26:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh, it's really rng?
[2:26:59] <Tham1k> Can you hold?
[2:27:01] <elicazzz> wasnt like tap twice and hold for big swing
[2:27:04] <projectcapsule> overhead when u hold
[2:27:13] <Davimotion96> it's direction depending I think
[2:27:13] <+aBoner89> Life is like a pipe swing
[2:27:14] <+Aldra_E> its about holding or not
[2:27:14] <silentshrug> is there secret stamina maybe?
[2:27:15] <+JohnMcClane6194> holding it gives you the overhead
[2:27:21] <ragasquid> how's he doing lads
[2:27:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:27:22] <umbraawitch> you just have to press the attack really hard i think
[2:27:26] <silentshrug> you cant double swing too much?
[2:27:32] <+SaphronBlackbourne> !MOTIVATED
[2:27:33] <@Moobot> @SaphronBlackbourne 2436 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:27:35] <%livlinn> isn't that depends on how strong you push the buttons?

[2:29:31] <artoflec> yeah its also like attack speed vs. going for damage, like any light/heavy thing
[2:29:32] <%Javaa01> @vavilonica Always remember that firing both barrels is a true combo
[2:29:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @oneimportantthing James has a wider arsenal LUL

[2:30:47] <+JohnMcClane6194> @projectcapsule you can still get it on the PS3 PSN, but adding money to your wallet on the PS3 is fucked now, you need to do it through another console or pc
[2:30:48] <waltzqueen> HAMMER TIME
[2:30:49] <+king_of_mystery2> Harry has acquired Mjolnir

[2:31:04] <lehvak182> that's a lotta damage
[2:31:06] <%JoshManVGH> Hammer? Naw, PIKE!
[2:31:09] <%hereiam407> @BigNLazy For real, I had to buy one for the MGS legacy collection
[2:31:11] <+JohnMcClane6194> you can't walk while the hammer is readied, tho
[2:31:11] <+Aldra_E> This is what dark souls was based on Kappa
[2:31:14] <%RickyRelucent> but maybe it can hold a familiar spot in our hrarts
[2:31:15] <vavilonica> this is the end game build pretty much
[2:31:16] <projectcapsule> harry the mason
[2:31:17] <DrkJP520> I thought I remembered the pipe being stronger, but no, it was the hammer
[2:31:17] <%tigerfang86> Harry and Heather are definitely the Chads of Silent Hill
[2:31:20] <%livlinn> bye Pipe chan lucidHands
[2:31:21] <ChronoRomancer> convert that hammer to a chaos hammer if you really want this run to get going
[2:31:21] <slackerunchained> Throw that pipe in the TRASH!
[2:31:22] <+aBoner89> PogChamp Pink Floyd Hammer!
[2:31:26] <Carlioo> no wonder the hammer is hard to use, he's using the sharp end rather than the wide, flat end
[2:31:31] <peachy996> You're Astaroth now
[2:31:34] <+Shady_Zaku> He IS a Mason
[2:31:35] <+Krasmeyts> @tigerfang86 Bloodline Technique?
[2:31:37] <%hereiam407> This is inspired Nightmare Creatures
[2:31:40] <%RemedyofRevenge> this really is the Dark Souls of survival horror games
[2:31:41] <+gpallas> That purple goodness
[2:31:43] <%RickyRelucent> just dont huck it
[2:31:43] <+Shady_Zaku> Masons fuck shit up with hammers after all
[2:31:44] <%oneimportantthing> I really wanna see Woolie take a stab at Downcoming
[2:31:45] <%r3dfall3142> The hammer is one of the best melee weapons. Absolutely destroys the nurses.
[2:31:51] <%JoshManVGH> Perpendicular to the box is the only safe way to pick up bullets.
[2:31:51] <dundore77> cant risk reaching across scrath and thats tetanus
[2:31:57] <majindusto> Ummmm
[2:32:02] <Carlioo> ok but what if this game had a mgs system where harry gets stronger the more times he swings heavy weapons
[2:32:03] <%JoshManVGH> Off a few degrees, who knows what might happen
[2:32:04] <dundore77> scratch*
[2:32:04] <dukenux> The Masons have a genetical disease that prevents them from extending arms too much
[2:32:05] <%hereiam407> @oneimportantthing To be disappointed?
[2:32:06] <QueequegTheater> I hope next he finds an infinite chainsaw
[2:32:08] <elicazzz> tha look suspisious

[2:33:10] <+ikantreeed> oooh clip??

[2:34:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:34:23] <Treasure_Vault> Might've looked everywhere, might've missed something
[2:34:28] <%RemedyofRevenge> need to mod that Guh Huh into Banjo Kazooie
[2:34:40] <JDebss> LUL
[2:34:40] <+ikantreeed> What type of sream is that LMAOOOOO
[2:34:50] <%hereiam407> Welcome. In. Silent. Hill. Blah hahahah
[2:34:51] <+gpallas> What did he miss? I was just folding some clothes
[2:34:56] <Treasure_Vault> He missed a thing in the storeroom i think
[2:34:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @ikantreeed woolieKICKDAD
[2:34:59] <dukenux> if the door is scribbled over with a wavy line it's permamently locked
[2:35:05] <%Hapsam> probably in the basement
[2:35:12] <silentshrug> this game cinematic af
[2:35:15] <dukenux> straight line and you might unlock it eventually
[2:35:19] <+gpallas> Ah, the one with the key
[2:35:29] <+gpallas> Wait no
[2:35:39] <+gpallas> That was another room, I think
[2:36:04] <Treasure_Vault> Look at the storeroom on the map.
[2:36:09] <DrkJP520> To have this not take forever, there was something important you missed in a room you would most likely not think to go over once more.
[2:36:19] <elicazzz> storeroom is key
[2:36:29] <Bl4kDynamite> Pretty sure there's more in the storeroom
[2:36:35] <Treasure_Vault> Take another look at that storeroom. Maybe enter the storeroom and look at the map.
[2:36:37] <%Hapsam> when a key opens a room, there might be more to it
[2:36:37] <Bl4kDynamite> You had to unlock it after all
[2:36:42] <%oneimportantthing> I dunno why, but there's something weirdly cozy about experiencing this spooky stream with you guys. Cheers!
[2:36:53] <+TheAmazingNick> Oh its this part, that was probably my least favourite of the game
[2:36:59] <elicazzz> big spookz

[3:16:47] <Royvald> @oneimportantthing To be fair, maybe Harry has a phobia of dinosaurs.
[3:16:52] <emMmDeeKay> Harry pops a wall and stomps with the armor
[3:16:54] <%FallenAngelZelos> hoping around like he's in Mary Poppins
[3:17:01] <slackerunchained> @oneimportantthing You see these enemies represent how Harry's psychology finds dinosaur's to be ultra-badass...
[3:17:02] <zepelinnn1> harry with the KBD tho?
[3:17:06] <%hereiam407> @waltzqueen Silent Hill to itself: 'Oh we gotta keep this one'

[3:17:39] <%hereiam407> Cool
[3:17:39] <%dds333a> there is a reason for that
[3:17:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Shattered memories is a remake of this
[3:17:39] <%jinking79> Now he See it
[3:17:43] <superchunk121> Shattered memories is a remake of 1
[3:17:46] <kingra> Oh dang yeah
[3:17:47] <DrkJP520> Shattered Memories is a reboot of this game, right?
[3:17:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> good memory damn
[3:17:48] <%livlinn> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[3:17:49] <%hereiam407> Very cool
[3:17:51] <%zanz_san> yup
[3:17:57] <+Breaknoon> "reimagining"
[3:17:58] <miucsa51> VoteYea
[3:17:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Hes starting to believe
[3:17:58] <+Shady_Zaku> @DrkJP520 pretty much
[3:17:59] <%dds333a> Shattered memories is a semi reboot
[3:18:00] <shieldecho> "Reimagining"
[3:18:00] <superchunk121> Or rather a retelling
[3:18:01] <jorniev> remember it's a remake... kinda
[3:18:03] <stranger59> I didn't know Shattered Memories kept the town layout
[3:18:04] <%oneimportantthing> Is this Anor Londo?
[3:18:04] <Nabs96> @superchunk121 Is it like a proper remake?
[3:18:05] <%dds333a> it's a retelling
[3:18:06] <OblivionSword1> well shattered memories is a retelling of SH 1
[3:18:08] <dundore77> yeah but can you stair at the copy and make her dress more lewd
[3:18:08] <MyNameIsRasus> yup
[3:18:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Rebbot basically
[3:18:09] <kingra> @DrkJP520 Alternate interpretation
[3:18:11] <%hereiam407> Yup
[3:18:14] <MyNameIsRasus> to SOME degree
[3:18:15] <majindusto> Shattered  Memories is a Reboot
[3:18:17] <jorniev> sequel too
[3:18:18] <QueequegTheater> It was also very bad
[3:18:20] <MyNameIsRasus> not exact same
[3:18:21] <+Shady_Zaku> yeah exactly
[3:18:25] <+Shady_Zaku> more or less
[3:18:26] <+kewlmyc> Wait, did he just now make the connection?
[3:18:27] <%livlinn> yeh
[3:18:28] <%jinking79> completely remake of the story
[3:18:29] <projectcapsule> still harry
[3:18:30] <%hereiam407> Its similar but not the same
[3:18:31] <+Krasmeyts> Remember chat: he started with Silent Souls 2
[3:18:31] <civilized_worm12> mind blown
[3:18:33] <emMmDeeKay> Shattered Memories is the Force Awakens of Silent Hill
[3:18:33] <Nabs96> oh so it's not a proper remake
[3:18:34] <%dds333a> I LOVE MY DADDY
[3:18:38] <shieldecho> I mean you're still playing as Harry Mason but...
[3:18:38] <waltzqueen> Still Harry, just an AU
[3:18:39] <amcq99> it rhymes
[3:18:40] <slackerunchained> This is - legit - one of the saddest frigging Antique shops one could imagine... Which actually makes perfect sense since it's just a front.
[3:18:41] <OblivionSword1> completely different Harry Mason as well
[3:18:41] <MyNameIsRasus> it's still harry mason in shattered memories
[3:18:41] <Mattais88> Ghostbuster 2016 or Silent Hill
[3:18:42] <BlackermanZX> its harry but not really
[3:18:43] <+Shady_Zaku> Still Harry actually
[3:18:46] <%hereiam407> I LUV MY DADDY
[3:18:51] <Nabs96> @emmmdeekay Oh so it's shit
[3:18:54] <projectcapsule> its harry arson
[3:18:55] <superchunk121> @Nabs96 Kinda. Uses similar locations with similar characters. Retlling with very different gameplay

[4:36:21] <+gpallas> I mean, 2D controls are also ludicrous, most of the time

[4:36:49] <%livlinn> sewer section feels long lucidShrug

[4:37:20] <%RickyRelucent> jank controls
[4:37:23] <dukenux> @oneimportantthing
[4:37:24] <dundore77> well pats arguement is it works better for fixed angles cause you are still going forward and non tank controls you change direction when the angles change, but most games dont have that problem cause they realized it
[4:37:26] <%livlinn> psaUp tank controlrlrsss
[4:37:30] <Nabs96> @hereiam407 Honestly that makes me happy cos I'm really enjoying this. maybe it's just cos of nostalgia from the old channel but sth about best friends and horror games just feels so cosy.
[4:37:30] <%oneimportantthing> @dds333a true lmao
[4:37:35] <BurdRightsActivist> I wanna see Reggie play PT and lose his shit.

[5:47:02] <+pkmamsters> that's literally the general consensus of the world
[5:47:02] <%hereiam407> Matrix 2 has that car scene, is what everyone says
[5:47:03] <wqorst> matrix 2 is just the freeway part in my mind
[5:47:04] <stranger59> 4 is at least better than 2 and 3

[5:47:22] <+xenoboost> when i was younger i liked 2 and 3 but then with age and future viewings, it dawned on me that it's not really good
[5:47:24] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> There's definitely a small following who do like the sequels, I've seen them in the wild for myself
[5:47:25] <xerotwo> Is this like how Halo 1 2 and 3 went? LUL

[5:48:20] <%dds333a> but goofy
[5:48:28] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Path of Neo is one the better movie game adaptions through sheer not giving any fucks
[5:48:33] <cinless> the extras did in fact wear rubber masks
[5:48:34] <lurkbait> LUL
