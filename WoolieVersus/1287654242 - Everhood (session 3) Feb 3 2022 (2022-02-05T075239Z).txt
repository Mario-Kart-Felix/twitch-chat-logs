[0:02:55] <%Orcapugs> Shadow Reggie is among us
[0:02:59] <axelkaspar> I am upset to learn Dying LIght 2 was badly hampered by the idiocy of the rich bastard at the head of production
[0:03:00] <+FirstSausage> @lion_kun A zippo is an actual flip lighter
[0:03:05] <+LazyAss24Seven> Bowl of pho is always amazing
[0:03:11] <axelkaspar> I am still looking forward to it
[0:03:30] <leith_aziz> @axelkaspar You mean the Denuvo?
[0:03:45] <%Lion_kun> Dying Light 2 seems to be good in spite of the bad decisions
[0:03:48] <%ChillaxingJay> woolieT
[0:03:59] <axelkaspar> No, the big cheese told the team they should only put in stuff he had already seen in other games, that he liked
[0:04:06] <MurseJOCO> Good morning guys from here in Los Angeles! I’m more of a ramen guy but pho is always good too
[0:04:12] <%Lion_kun> Which makes you pissed because of the great game you COULD have had
[0:04:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i always leave a note to dial a number to buzz em in the building, one guy just messaged me "hey im outside"
[0:04:16] <leith_aziz> Cohh's streaming it live if you wanna judge for yourself. I didnt have too much time to check but he seems happy with it
[0:04:17] <axelkaspar> "None of your ideas! Put in stuff from Ubisoft games!"
[0:04:38] <leith_aziz> @axelkaspar So, Ken Levine. Gotcha
[0:04:39] <%ChillaxingJay> makes sense
[0:04:50] <%Prevot> no take grug meat
[0:04:51] <axelkaspar> I have already pre-ordered DL2, I was just hoping the team had been given the opportunity to make it even better

[0:05:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah just like the good ol days, fight for your food
[0:05:38] <%Bin_VV> Bin_VV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Just wanted to say thanks for your GG lore videos for getting me into a fighting game I've taken seriously for the first time, much appreciation to you guys.
[0:05:47] <leith_aziz> I'd just give away my food like charity
[0:05:56] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:06:02] <%ChillaxingJay> LUL
[0:06:04] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:06:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[0:06:13] <leith_aziz> There was a guy who had his pizza late by half an hour. I was considering giving him the sandwitch I just bought
[0:06:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> with how often i've ordered stuff, im surprised that hasn't happened to me yet
[0:06:37] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! I never trust another person to touch my food, even for delivery.  I always do pick up
[0:06:42] <%ChillaxingJay> nope

[0:07:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:07:29] <leith_aziz> I tried that shit with Leffen on Romolla's chat
[0:07:36] <tolloponik> Jiminy cricket on vacation
[0:07:45] <leith_aziz> Suffice to say, we went nowhere
[0:07:52] <+Mrbaconator> i just say to agree to disagree a lot now
[0:07:55] <devanmuse> i ducked out before the end of the last everhood stream. did they beat superfrog?
[0:08:01] <@Menitta> the only person I'll fight with is me. internally. every day.
[0:08:12] <%Orcapugs> Oh I thought I was talking to a human being energy
[0:08:15] <%DashXero> @devanmuse Apparently now.
[0:08:17] <%Shad0wTag> Leffen is not smart enough for discussion
[0:08:36] <%ChillaxingJay> thats fucked up
[0:08:40] <+Jiggisnipe> WOW
[0:08:42] <%DashXero> Oh shit.
[0:08:43] <%baka_sugoi> oops
[0:09:05] <%Shad0wTag> Thats happened to me
[0:09:05] <%DashXero> @devanmuse *not
[0:09:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i wonder if all the people that tried pulling that were so handily dealt with that now current drivers don't try pulling that shit
[0:09:22] <@Menitta> the return on investment seems negative
[0:09:44] <leith_aziz> The discussion was basically him considering dropping Chipp because he's not top tier anymore, and then telling me he enjoys a character specifically because he's top tier, and im like "you should play a character you enjoy or fits your playstyle. Even tourney players have done that"
[0:09:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no
[0:09:54] <%Prevot> if youre6 constantly going to restaurants in the first place why not just get your own food
[0:10:02] <%livlinn> Ooooh Reggies hair is so floofy today shiaLove
[0:10:14] <DSD24> Eww

[0:10:23] <alroy909> oh god
[0:10:24] <%livlinn> shiaUHH
[0:10:25] <%SuckerPunchSyd> NO
[0:10:27] <+FirstSausage> Have you guys seen the NPR article about how 1/4 drivers admitted to eating your food from 2019?
[0:10:28] <%Shad0wTag> Reggie is UPSET
[0:10:30] <%DashXero> That man needs to go to jail.
[0:10:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> OH GOD NO
[0:10:32] <BigManLugan> neurons start flashing
[0:10:36] <leith_aziz> Wait, what? Say that again cohhM

[0:10:39] <CoffeeCobra> punishable by death
[0:10:48] <zedravan> does canada have food tampering laws?
[0:10:50] <%livlinn> oh no
[0:10:55] <MurseJOCO> Oh hell nawww
[0:10:57] <CoffeeCobra> hung drawn and quartered
[0:10:57] <@Menitta> remember that trend of fucking licking ice cream containers in grocery stores?
[0:11:02] <%kyh9> Don’t trust ANYONE to touch your food
[0:11:04] <%ChillaxingJay> unforgivable
[0:11:05] <%DashXero> No jury would convict whomever murdered that guy.
[0:11:12] <leith_aziz> @Menitta What, like the gift wrap?
[0:11:14] <%holydeviant1> I must be incredibly lucky, I've never had to deal with this
[0:11:17] <%kyh9> Delivery people are inherently untrustworthy in my book
[0:11:19] <leith_aziz> cohhSus
[0:11:23] <%Indigo_Automaton> I did that with a video game christmas present once
[0:11:29] <@Menitta> I wish that's what I meant.

[0:11:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> Carefully took it out of the plastic and played it in the middle of the night and snuck it back
[0:11:54] <%holydeviant1> @Indigo_Automaton Did you have parents/relatives who carefully wrapped presents to preserve wrapping paper?
[0:11:58] <yehdinh> As they say, "Don't be stupid, stupid"
[0:12:04] <CoffeeCobra> I always got good food from the same place until one day it gave me mad food poisoning, I felt bad until I learnt a lot of folks also got food poisoning
[0:12:08] <%kyh9> BUT WOOLIE, WHAT IF THEY EAT YOUR FOOD WITHOUT YOU KNOWING AND THEY GET A HUGE TIP, WHAT IF BOTH
[0:12:08] <%Shad0wTag> At least with pizza its obvious
[0:12:15] <+theoldone001> Did you learn the tech Woolie??
[0:12:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton It was before it was in the present wrapping
[0:12:20] <%oneimportantthing> Am European, people usually get good enough salaries to make tipping unnecessary
[0:12:24] <%holydeviant1> @kyh9 HE WILL ALWAYS KNOW
[0:12:24] <OkamiDude15> did you check the tapes?
[0:12:30] <%X2Eliah> @Shad0wTag Not if you pick off the toppings

[0:14:54] <%oneimportantthing> I still remember the grocery store licking videos
[0:14:55] <MurseJOCO> Maybe if it was a spork
[0:14:57] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> that woman would probably recycle toilet paper
[0:15:09] <okamiizero> She forked up.
[0:15:11] <%Lion_kun> The only good gag in Don't Look Up
[0:15:22] <CoffeeCobra> imagine the frog is the plastic fork person and maybe you'll one-shot him @WoolieVersus
[0:15:25] <leith_aziz> Was it a fast food restaurant?
[0:15:26] <%X2Eliah> That 2.50 poutine don't sound that good anymore
[0:15:37] <+ArtemisCroc> anyone I know who runs a resaurant would send an employee to the ollar store to get more forks
[0:15:39] <Knight_Anastasia> There places falling apart and unclean I've been too.
[0:15:46] <+Jiggisnipe> @leith_aziz Lady working at restaurant used a plastic fork. After she was done using it, she put it back with the other unused plastic forks
[0:15:46] <+ArtemisCroc> dollar*
[0:16:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @leith_aziz sounds like it was a local pizza place 😰
[0:16:05] <leith_aziz> @Jiggisnipe YIKES

[0:16:24] <%X2Eliah> Oh its very relatable
[0:16:27] <zedravan> too relatable
[0:16:28] <@Menitta> it's relatable and also horrifying
[0:16:43] <%holydeviant1> The drivers arund me are either really honest, or very good at theft
[0:16:51] <@Menitta> I had my breakfast delivered today
[0:16:54] <%ChillaxingJay> ive gone through this shit so much that i just learned how to cook my own food to avoid the bs

[0:53:36] <CoffeeCobra> CAT GOD
[0:53:37] <dukenux> what a RE ass puzzle
[0:53:37] <%jepupu> Emerald was on the dancing electric man probably?
[0:53:39] <nyacoo> You've already seen who has the green one
[0:53:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I'd assume an emerald???
[0:53:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just cram the 8-ball in there
[0:53:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> You can go get the third gem now
[0:53:52] <dukenux> ye
[0:53:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh yeah dancing light guy had an emerald
[0:54:08] <teefpal> Who had the third gem?
[0:54:08] <BlackermanZX> wheres the damn emerald wooliePOYO
[0:54:19] <+Flarepulse> how did woolie's frog business turn out
[0:54:21] <CoffeeCobra> FLOWER SHOP HAD IT PogChamp
[0:54:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> bruh fog isn't defeated he's dead lmao
[0:54:32] <rasamune> @Flarepulse He beat him
[0:54:35] <Mr_Rakjo> Woolie already fought the light guy
[0:54:39] <teefpal> frog status: yeeted
[0:54:41] <+Flarepulse> SeemsGood
[0:54:42] <dukenux> Frog ascended
[0:54:44] <Ech0Log1ck> they cant get that anymore right?
[0:54:50] <dg4ii> @Ech0Log1ck they can
[0:54:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Now is the time for murder
[0:54:57] <CoffeeCobra> can he not use the statue? did he not pick up the emerald?
[0:55:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> The Light being had the 3rd gem when you beat him, but you had to kill him to get it. Getting it now is kinda obtuse
[0:55:01] <dg4ii> @Ech0Log1ck it's in the theatre
[0:55:07] <Mr_Rakjo> @Ech0Log1ck dude respawns on the movie theathre
[0:55:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Time for a third round of talking
[0:55:20] <dukenux> wait, you can kill the note?
[0:55:24] <nyacoo> @CoffeeCobra you don't get it if you beat the boss the pacifist way i think
[0:55:30] <CoffeeCobra> OHH
[0:55:32] <CoffeeCobra> huh!
[0:55:35] <teefpal> Oh so the light guy has the third gem?
[0:55:41] <sud4ii> LET'S GO LIGHT BEING
[0:55:46] <sud4ii> Yes, Light Guy has the gem
[0:55:49] <CoffeeCobra> they gotta kill Scott then LUL
[0:56:09] <teefpal> Is there a way to kill scott after this?
[0:56:12] <hassanico2> I imagine the Frog battle made him forget about the emerald
[0:56:13] <zedravan> the lightguy had a gem when you fought them
[0:56:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[0:56:46] <Pookiedaexzile> There is no state change
[0:56:51] <hassanico2> Is Light Guy a soul?
[0:57:01] <Ech0Log1ck> Is it still possible to get the emerald?
[0:57:05] <dg4ii> @Ech0Log1ck yes
[0:57:05] <BlackermanZX> so wheres electro man
[0:57:06] <rasamune> @teefpal He appears elsewhere after he leaves the chest. That's your last chance to beat him
[0:57:07] <Mr_Rakjo> Yes
[0:57:13] <dukenux> do those cat paw prints just appear randomly
[0:57:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Nothing is different unless
[0:57:16] <Pookiedaexzile> ...
[0:57:24] <teefpal> So we have to find and kill Scott Cawthon
[0:57:29] <dg4ii> @rasamune you have unlimited tries in the second location I believe
[0:57:44] <rasamune> Do you? That's good to know
[0:57:52] <rasamune> Because I tried to re-fight him and he never appeared again
[0:57:52] <hassanico2> @dukenux no those are because of the lantern they got
[0:58:00] <Ech0Log1ck> @dg4ii oh thats good, they don't let you softlock yourself out of that fight
[0:58:03] <OkamiDude15> @dukenux they appear when you stand still to show you the closest soul
[0:58:05] <PKSomething> @hassanico2 light guy is not required, he is an optional boss that can be outlasted or killed
[0:58:18] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[0:58:19] <dukenux> you can't kill the ATM?
[0:58:20] <Yomamma1337> its flowey yeah
[0:58:20] <$ArCielArDor> Jesus Woolie just kill everything already
[0:58:21] <teefpal> Flowey vibes
[0:58:51] <dg4ii> @dukenux you can, but it doesn't count towards souls. The game adds a soul to your counter before removing itself.
[0:58:52] <dukenux> do you want to kill Zigg first or leave him for dessert
[0:59:10] <dg4ii> idk why it's an interesting detail though
[0:59:16] <OkamiDude15> woolie going for the gems u guess
[0:59:22] <dukenux> @dg4ii well i mean if i gonna murder everyone i might as well destroy the ATM
[0:59:37] <dukenux> especially that its evil
[0:59:40] <hassanico2> So what exactly is he trying to do?
[0:59:41] <Triplicat> did he beat frog
[0:59:44] <hassanico2> Oh right the gem
[0:59:50] <OkamiDude15> yeah he beat frog
[0:59:55] <Triplicat> thx
[0:59:56] <dg4ii> @hassanico2 get the emerald to put in a cat statue and meet "their maker"
[1:00:08] <Yomamma1337> do they remember where they saw the emerald?
[1:00:11] <hassanico2> too late it's over 2 hours Purple
[1:00:16] <AppleBerryKitty> at this point im pretty sure everyones just gonna repeat themselves
[1:00:30] <+Pluto_Mars9> tovgFrog Ride frog forever tovgFrog
[1:00:32] <Triplicat> shit I don't even remember where the emerald is LUL
[1:00:40] <Pookiedaexzile> You can't get he Green Emerald without killing the light guy
[1:00:44] <Triplicat> oh
[1:00:46] <Mr_Rakjo> @Yomamma1337 they didnt even notinced it
[1:00:48] <+Skelefellah> It was from the dancing Light guy from the chest
[1:00:50] <$ArCielArDor> oh goddamn it is this going to be an hour of woolie hemming and hawing about this?
[1:00:51] <Mr_Rakjo> Noticed*
[1:00:54] <dg4ii> they'll get to the emerald eventually chat
[1:00:58] <+RazeEmAll> Pretty sure Light Being has it, but if you don't beat him he disappears, and you can't get it. RIP
[1:01:06] <Yomamma1337> @RazeEmAll you can get it still
[1:01:08] <dg4ii> @RazeEmAll they can still get it
[1:01:13] <ordnavi> he reappears
[1:01:17] <%Indigo_Automaton> Getting the 3rd gem is dependent on random chance when you enter a specific room
[1:01:20] <+BigBruthaThunda> White being can reappear at the movie theater!
[1:01:20] <$ArCielArDor> oh wait is he trying to find the emerald?
[1:01:26] <+BigBruthaThunda> light*
[1:01:33] <geekpatientzero> go left of the mailbox
[1:01:34] <BlackermanZX> light guy is chillin somewhere
[1:01:37] <ordnavi> white being
[1:01:47] <dg4ii> @Indigo_Automaton blue light guy is always in the theatre right?
[1:01:52] <Yomamma1337> yeah and then there was a piece of paper talking about it
[1:01:52] <+BigBruthaThunda> he goes to the theater at the go kart level
[1:01:52] <Pookiedaexzile> That you only get from killing him
[1:01:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> @dg4ii Yes
[1:01:58] <Mr_Rakjo> Yes
[1:02:04] <OkamiDude15> if you spared him you can get the gem another way
[1:02:06] <Mr_Rakjo> No
[1:02:11] <nyacoo> there is one other way
[1:02:14] <teefpal> The theater then
[1:02:16] <Yomamma1337> @OkamiDude15 another way is misleading
[1:02:21] <dg4ii> @Indigo_Automaton then what is the random chance
[1:02:33] <Yomamma1337> its based on rng so we might want to tell you
[1:02:41] <%Indigo_Automaton> The theatre in the Carnival. I'm not sure the game ever gives a hint to him being there
[1:02:51] <Mr_Rakjo> There is no more pacifist , the frog is the end
[1:02:53] <zedravan> movie theater but it is random chance they appear
[1:02:54] <Saltmeisterr> hood of eternity
[1:02:56] <AppleBerryKitty> gggg the red
[1:02:57] <Mr_Rakjo> it goes nowhere else
[1:03:03] <+Rafraud> Nodders
[1:03:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah you can re fight him in the theater by going in and out of it? It says random chance he appears
[1:03:07] <+BigBruthaThunda> yeah just keep reloading the theater until he is there
[1:03:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> You can enter and exit the room until he appears
[1:03:12] <%livlinn> forgottenJerry

[1:08:34] <velgaduere> HOW SHOULD I FEEEEEL
[1:08:37] <%Charronia> Gotta learn how to fight limesKnife
[1:08:37] <hassanico2> Why does the game even flash "10"? Is there even any time you do more damage?
[1:08:38] <%livlinn> Oop
[1:08:43] <Triplicat> it's not like they didn't try to foreshadow it in the lore notes and dialogue by repeatedly saying everyone is immortal
[1:08:43] <+cubbywolf> let us BATTLE
[1:08:44] <zedravan> big heal
[1:08:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> I watched another streamer do this battle... it aint easy
[1:08:59] <nyacoo> @hassanico2 Yes, but only one place
[1:09:01] <dg4ii> @hassanico2 maybe it was planned at one point
[1:09:03] <tolloponik> have they fought pink mage yet?
[1:09:04] <rasamune> @hassanico2 No, it's just aesthetic. I don't know why they went with that instead of just like, hearts
[1:09:21] <LordOfThePoultry> holy moly
[1:09:25] <@Menitta> is killing also a DPS race before the song ends
[1:09:30] <+projectmanatees> because its a perfect 10
[1:09:30] <rasamune> Sure is!
[1:09:34] <@Menitta> Damn
[1:09:35] <Yomamma1337> @Menitta yes thats the hard part about this fight
[1:09:35] <hassanico2> Too bad it takes so long to start
[1:09:52] <%oneimportantthing> "woolie the killer stole my gem" - light bender, probably
[1:10:06] <BreakfastSampler> @Menitta not all fights have that strict race though, some loop to allow for the kill
[1:10:10] <Yomamma1337> you can grab those too
[1:10:14] <%HeroToxiko> SourPls
[1:10:14] <velgaduere> so is this Scott Cawthon or what
[1:10:20] <+BigBruthaThunda> killing is hard, because the shooting mechanic breaks you out of the rhythm
[1:10:31] <dg4ii> @velgaduere no but it's funny to call them that
[1:10:34] <+cubbywolf> it doesnt matter what lane you are in for damage i think
[1:10:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:10:45] <AppleBerryKitty> somethin tells me you shouldn't dodge so much at this point.
[1:10:53] <teefpal> Shoot to kill
[1:10:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:10:55] <zedravan> any lane works for damage
[1:10:55] <SaintSalted> my boy DJ buusanut goin ham
[1:10:56] <dg4ii> @cubbywolf attacks can be blocked by other attacks
[1:11:01] <Yomamma1337> @cubbywolf it kind of does, you gotta maximize how many notes you grab while avoiding the red
[1:11:03] <%oneimportantthing> SURVI-*dies
[1:11:11] <+cubbywolf> yeah but he doesnt need to go to the middle to attack everytime
[1:11:13] <rasamune> Yeah this is the tricky part, you can't send a bullet down a lane with (a) a wall or (b) two+ of any other kind of bullet
[1:11:14] <hassanico2> What can't you grab?
[1:11:17] <ordnavi> KILL
[1:11:26] <%Shad0wTag> WE KILLING JAMIE FOXX TONIGHT
[1:11:27] <Triplicat> can't grab black/shadow
[1:11:29] <Clyderso> just command grab
[1:11:40] <%livlinn> shiaWiggle woolieCRAB shiaWiggle woolieCRAB shiaWiggle woolieCRAB
[1:11:53] <+cubbywolf> oh i see its the clearest lane at the start
[1:11:54] <+BigBruthaThunda> cant grab the rainbows either
[1:11:58] <+BigBruthaThunda> oh nvm
[1:12:23] <%oneimportantthing> I like how half of the citizens wish to die while the rest will fight to remain eternal
[1:12:42] <Zeneeba> and im back. just in time for the scort cawthon fight
[1:13:14] <BlackermanZX> this mf has a ton of hp
[1:13:15] <%oneimportantthing> Woolz you beat the frog, allow yourself the story mode maybe
[1:13:16] <AppleBerryKitty> this is gonna be hard
[1:13:27] <dg4ii> oh they aren't even close
[1:13:32] <+Jiggisnipe> @oneimportantthing yea which is why I think just kill everyone is an odd moral choice
[1:13:32] <+ghostfaceninja_> monkaS survive
[1:13:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah he's gonna have to be way more aggressive
[1:13:38] <dukenux> halfway ther
[1:13:41] <Yomamma1337> do you see how intense the dps check is?
[1:13:45] <rasamune> He needs to be going -way- more aggro, even when he's hurt, else he's not gonna be able to do enough damage before the song ends
[1:13:46] <+cubbywolf> wow
[1:13:46] <+Jiggisnipe> why
[1:13:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lord
[1:13:50] <nyacoo> DPS race

[1:14:40] <+IrishWeegee> Why are you L O V E
[1:14:48] <+Rafraud> To be fair Woolie has never attacked until literally right now
[1:15:02] <+Grayhammatter> never stop going in
[1:15:03] <sud4ii> Might be worth leaving this one for later. It's probably the hardest boss to actually kill lol..
[1:15:20] <hassanico2> He mixes a lot of random other notes early on
[1:15:26] <dg4ii> eh, theres one equally as hard and one harder
[1:15:27] <a_mad_dragon_> straight from the hardest fight to the second hardest fight LUL
[1:15:35] <%oneimportantthing> Instead of waiting on keys you gotta actively move at them
[1:15:44] <+maria_luke> you need to grab ammo while switching lanes.
[1:15:49] <Mr_Rakjo> no
[1:15:51] <teefpal> No
[1:15:53] <LunarRemix> No.
[1:15:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> It basically is the same, you're just delaying it by doing pacifist first
[1:15:54] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[1:15:55] <nyacoo> nah
[1:15:56] <+Skelefellah> No
[1:15:57] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> No
[1:16:00] <Triplicat> @a_mad_dragon_ lmao I know right
[1:16:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Nada
[1:16:02] <+CrownlessKitty> nope
[1:16:05] <teefpal> It's the same ending
[1:16:08] <%oneimportantthing> This isn't Undertale, consider that a fakeout at best
[1:16:08] <Clyderso> just different frog dialogue
[1:16:11] <+BigBruthaThunda> no but gems is a seperate thing from genocide
[1:16:11] <nyacoo> after frog and this, the rest is going to be a cakewalk
[1:16:13] <Mr_Rakjo> The endgoal is to set the immortals free like the frog and the tree tell you
[1:16:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Not all
[1:16:23] <Pookiedaexzile> at*
[1:16:28] <Yomamma1337> pacifist ending was literally the game telling you that what you did didnt matter
[1:16:40] <%holydeviant1> Woolie keeps stumbling on super ultra mega hardmode bosses
[1:16:47] <dukenux> ^
[1:16:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Pascifist Ending was the game shitting on you
[1:16:48] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:16:50] <ordnavi> another 2 day fight
[1:16:55] <hassanico2> So is this the hardest Kill?
[1:16:57] <dukenux> this is this entire game
[1:17:00] <dg4ii> @hassanico2 no
[1:17:01] <%oneimportantthing> Undertale has created some serious mindgoblins
[1:17:01] <nyacoo> Well, that WAS a fast kill
[1:17:05] <DSD24> Stay strong stay determined
[1:17:06] <Yomamma1337> @hassanico2 id say theres one thats harder
[1:17:10] <%holydeviant1> Frog was hardest passive, Light is hardest kill lol
[1:17:10] <dukenux> Woolie just running balls first into CBT
[1:17:11] <hassanico2> Top 3?
[1:17:14] <%Indigo_Automaton> You can come back for him after practicing against lesser souls
[1:17:15] <teefpal> Meh, the pacifist ending is a valid end
[1:17:20] <Clyderso> Lightorias of the Beats
[1:17:20] <Yomamma1337> @holydeviant1 imo the other 2 are both harder
[1:17:39] <Yomamma1337> you HAVE to attack
[1:17:42] <+CrownlessKitty> attack to defend
[1:17:45] <+Skelefellah> Eating shots = surviving!
[1:17:49] <teefpal> You have to give up on surviving for survivals sake
[1:17:51] <dukenux> it's valid end, but it's kinda hollow narratively wise, cause it amounts to almost nothing
[1:17:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:17:58] <cthulu_fearlock> time is short must keep fighting
[1:18:01] <BlackermanZX> attack or attack or no balls wooliePOYO
[1:18:03] <+RazeEmAll> if you deflect you don't get hit, so you just have to gamble sometimes
[1:18:08] <Pookiedaexzile> You can fire back 1
[1:18:12] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> The voice in the pacifist ending literally says that if you think you can reach an ending via inaction you missed the point of the game
[1:18:12] <teefpal> You have to do frame perfect dodges
[1:18:14] <hassanico2> You gotta get bloody when you're killing, it ain't clean
[1:18:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but if you keep dodgin, you can't do enough dps
[1:18:28] <+PMAvers> Do we want to maybe find a baby fight to practice murderin' on first?
[1:18:31] <Yomamma1337> attacking and failing is at least trying to win
[1:19:02] <HR_Freud> remember that offense is also defense
[1:19:13] <Yomamma1337> legit just reset from there
[1:19:16] <teefpal> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter And I disagree with the games premise that murder is the right choice.  But that's a personal thing, nothing on the game or the devs
[1:19:18] <dg4ii> i kind of wish you didn't get credits after the pacifist ending
[1:19:20] <hassanico2> This is also partially memorization based on a pretty long song/fight
[1:19:27] <Triplicat> oh shit light man airgrabbed him as nova at round start
[1:19:29] <+Catpurnicus> Just keep Babycake's message in your heart Woolie
[1:19:44] <dg4ii> there are several gripes I have with this game and its endings
[1:19:45] <+Catpurnicus> Be. Aggressive. B E Aggressive
[1:20:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> Remember this is a optional super boss. You can go kill other souls first to get a better hang of the new mechanics if you need to
[1:20:02] <hassanico2> Better!
[1:20:13] <+Catpurnicus> also you can absorb earlier than point blank
[1:20:13] <AppleBerryKitty> yes
[1:20:14] <teefpal> yeah
[1:20:18] <Yomamma1337> attacking still defends you
[1:20:27] <AppleBerryKitty> you'll figure somethin out
[1:20:30] <hassanico2> Both a deflect and an attack are still defensive plays at 1HP so yeah
[1:20:43] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> @teefpal Fair enough, I just mean that whether or not you agree that murder is the right solution, doing nothing can't solve anything here, because this world is an Immortal Realm detached from Time
[1:20:52] <Yomamma1337> you can absorb 2 units in a row, its just a bit tight
[1:20:54] <%oneimportantthing> Yo you need to find some easier enemy to practice the art of murder
[1:21:11] <%oneimportantthing> *victim
[1:21:20] <Yomamma1337> you can 2 hits in between every red

[1:21:24] <teefpal> you have to move between lanes collecting shots
[1:21:30] <+RazeEmAll> Shopkeep has a banger
[1:21:38] <hassanico2> Shields engender passivity Kappa
[1:21:52] <+birddotexe> oooh the drums
[1:21:59] <+RazeEmAll> oh that was good tho
[1:22:00] <+Catpurnicus> I did this boss with color blind setting still on, and I thought that all the cross-shaped notes were immune to deflect lol
[1:22:03] <Yomamma1337> i did it on the left
[1:22:10] <Yomamma1337> well middle for the first bit
[1:22:13] <hassanico2> His brain is beginning to expand
[1:22:19] <+Catpurnicus> so I got a loooot of practice getting as many hits in on this first part as possible
[1:22:33] <dg4ii> by the way, if anyone in chat is interested in practicing Unity, theres a custom battle contest going on for Everhood right now! First place gets some money and merch and stuff
[1:22:33] <+Catpurnicus> with the right pattern you can basically rapid fire
[1:22:39] <%oneimportantthing> The LP will be 100 episode of woolie refusing to not do hard mode lmao
[1:22:58] <CashewZero> fuck this boss rocked me
[1:23:00] <%livlinn> spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance
[1:23:13] <dg4ii> oh right it's on expert
[1:23:19] <+Catpurnicus> its on hard
[1:23:23] <dg4ii> the difficulty of MEN oh ok
[1:23:25] <BlackermanZX> i think you have to fight him on the  rainbow to keep DPS
[1:23:33] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie ain't no coward
[1:23:41] <HotSauceFiend> oh man we are back to light man?
[1:23:42] <Yomamma1337> you have to memorize the walls
[1:23:43] <+Catpurnicus> yeah you need to get hits on rainbow but its not that bad
[1:23:47] <ordnavi> you have to basically perfect this fight on expert
[1:23:50] <+Catpurnicus> you just need a few
[1:24:01] <+PMAvers> During the rainbow part, it does feel like there's some lines where there'll just be two notes one after another that look to be safe to grab.
[1:24:12] <%Indigo_Automaton> There's actually very little difference between Normal and Hard, other than Normal gives you faster health regen. Enemies deal the same damage and have the same attacks patterns. Your hp stays the same too
[1:24:22] <+Catpurnicus> you can also grab the first note then immediately dodge
[1:24:31] <+Catpurnicus> especially if they are stepped
[1:24:37] <Yomamma1337> you can absorb from the side too
[1:24:52] <ordnavi> enemies have less health on normal
[1:24:53] <%oneimportantthing> Go fight anyone else first, you can't do this fight as your first intro to killing on hard
[1:24:58] <+Catpurnicus> you can absorb and do an instant side jump
[1:24:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[1:24:59] <nyacoo> But faster recovering HP can still make the difference between a loss and staying alive
[1:25:04] <hassanico2> Y-O-U-R L-O-V-E
[1:25:07] <+Flarepulse> theres a bit of a "tap your head, rub your belly" problem with going on offense
[1:25:09] <BlackermanZX> you can shoot 1 insead of absorbing 2 right
[1:25:16] <Yomamma1337> @nyacoo yeah but hes not trying to live, hes trying to kill
[1:25:28] <+Skelefellah> @BlackermanZX No you need 2 of the same color
[1:25:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> Why Oh You Are L-O-V-E
[1:25:50] <AppleBerryKitty> not good enough
[1:25:50] <BlackermanZX> ah i see
[1:25:51] <+Catpurnicus> if you look at absorb/shoot as just another tool like jump and use it all the time (like you do in this run) its not too bad
[1:25:51] <CashewZero> has woolie made it to the end of a track without killing before? i remember i had this guy at like 5% and i wanted to die that i wasnt aggro enough
[1:25:54] <Yomamma1337> you need to be WAY more aggressive
[1:25:56] <HotSauceFiend> need to be super aggresive
[1:26:00] <+Catpurnicus> pacifist is the hardest because you have to hold back
[1:26:03] <Seithri> you need to rush deflect
[1:26:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ABS, always be shooting
[1:26:12] <Yomamma1337> like double how many shots youre parrying at the start
[1:26:13] <teefpal> You're gonna do most of your damage in the first half
[1:26:17] <Mr_Rakjo> @CashewZero woolie did pacifist first this is his first time killing someone
[1:26:19] <tolloponik> that rainbow section os the hit him part of the song
[1:26:25] <teefpal> You need to move and shoot *constantly*
[1:26:25] <+RazeEmAll> when i did this, i had to literally dodge into bullets constantly to deflect, it's nuts
[1:26:27] <Onamar> easy mode is now selectable
[1:26:28] <CashewZero> @Mr_Rakjo cool, thanks
[1:26:32] <Yomamma1337> you have to straight up memorize it
[1:26:39] <+Catpurnicus> also if you seek out the notes aggressively
[1:27:29] <HotSauceFiend> from the get go woolie is staying in the middle lan which makes this dps race hard to accomplish
[1:27:40] <+Rafraud> Should he be doing this boss yet?
[1:27:50] <+Catpurnicus> if you get a perfect run you can absorb to the beat like woolie was doing jumps against frog at the end
[1:27:53] <+Rafraud> I guess this is good training if anything
[1:27:56] <HotSauceFiend> @rafraud no reason no to
[1:28:04] <+PkSilent01> Did Woolie ever beat the frog?
[1:28:08] <Yomamma1337> @PkSilent01 yeah
[1:28:13] <HR_Freud> just don't fire on the red beat
[1:28:25] <Aussie_Manny> lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE lytJIVE
[1:28:29] <Yomamma1337> damn i guess im replaying this fight lol
[1:28:41] <bippityjones> Moondertale's soundtrack rips sirbee4WormwoodDance
[1:28:53] <Seithri> frog 2
[1:28:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can alwys return
[1:28:54] <+Catpurnicus> yeah you gotta change lanes after absorbing 2 to not hit the wall
[1:28:55] <Yomamma1337> you need to parry every orange you can at the start, 2 per wave isnt enoughj
[1:29:07] <Onamar> You can do this last
[1:29:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Come back for him later?
[1:29:21] <HotSauceFiend> from what I see you need to be moving and hitting constanrly
[1:29:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> practice on some chumps first
[1:29:32] <+BuckySmalls> GANBATTE VoHiYo
[1:29:33] <HotSauceFiend> youre staying in the middle lane too often
[1:29:38] <zedravan> he has a gem
[1:29:39] <Yomamma1337> MURDER
[1:29:40] <BlackermanZX> shoot like a madman i guess
[1:29:41] <HotSauceFiend> at the beginning
[1:29:42] <teefpal> It takes 1 shot per second
[1:29:43] <+birddotexe> yup
[1:29:44] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:29:47] <%townzzzzz> KILL
[1:29:52] <+doped_bones> Murder Time
[1:29:52] <CashewZero> set it to kids mode! :)
[1:29:54] <+HereComestheChief> K I L L lytEVIL
[1:29:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> You can fight him later after training against other souls
[1:29:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Kill to learn how to Kill?
[1:29:59] <%oneimportantthing> RETVRN TO EASY MODE
[1:30:02] <BlackermanZX> you could always leave this fight for later
[1:30:15] <dukenux> or select easy modo :)
[1:30:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> The three gens lead to a secret ending with another super boss
[1:30:20] <+BigBruthaThunda> yea two different ends
[1:30:21] <Seithri> this does lead to another ending
[1:30:22] <Mr_Rakjo> The gems are a secret ending different from killing everyone
[1:30:23] <a_mad_dragon_> GEMS ARE SEPERATE ENDING
[1:30:26] <+El_Rabbit> Select baby mode
[1:30:30] <teefpal> is the statue ending different if you don't kill anyone else?
[1:30:31] <Yomamma1337> pacifist is the only non-ending
[1:30:33] <zedravan> 3 gems is a different ending
[1:30:37] <Pookiedaexzile> You have to kill everyone both ways
[1:30:37] <%pi_in_the_sci> There is a gem ending
[1:31:06] <+BigBruthaThunda> and gems is harder
[1:31:17] <teefpal> Make a save slot with the pacifist, switch to genocide
[1:31:21] <BlackermanZX> same
[1:31:29] <+vexion_smh> same
[1:31:33] <dukenux> Gems is giga ultra hyper secret ending +
[1:31:34] <%Shad0wTag> You are right to do pacifist first @woolieversus
[1:31:37] <+Jiggisnipe> the real question is how many endings are there?
[1:31:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie if you did this on your own, you would be running around infinitely until you look up what to do
[1:31:49] <AppleBerryKitty> people say stop thinking of this as undertale
[1:31:53] <Triplicat> 6
[1:31:53] <%Shad0wTag> because the game has been encouraging you to kill
[1:31:57] <+BuckySmalls> Maybe make a seperate save?
[1:31:58] <HotSauceFiend> yeah but chat is sorta toxic in these undertalesque games
[1:31:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:31:59] <+notgoodatnamessorry> I actually love that you did pacifism first, it's super interesting to watch
[1:32:15] <%Shad0wTag> @hotsaucefiend We have been pretty good to be honest
[1:32:16] <%Necnill> LUL
[1:32:18] <Aussie_Manny> lytJIVE
[1:32:20] <Yomamma1337> i thought it being the opposite of undertale story wise was pretty clear personally
[1:32:23] <+Jiggisnipe> BE B E AGGRESSIVE
[1:32:27] <BlackermanZX> guess you have to blast like a madman nonstop
[1:32:31] <dukenux> Pacifism first feels like the right way to play this, because it show you it does nothing
[1:32:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FROG PART 2
[1:32:36] <%Zero_Jacks> Chat. just chill and listen to the jams
[1:32:36] <Yomamma1337> doing 3 of the 4 super bosses in a row seems painful\
[1:32:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> So i started blasting
[1:32:41] <dukenux> so you need to try a different route
[1:32:42] <%RigmaroleHM> Agreed, it's like playing through an RPG, then when you've achieved everything and beaten all the baddies, you go and kill everything as the new villain
[1:32:47] <+Catpurnicus> difficulty doesn't change the note pattern, right? just the healing rate?
[1:32:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> i had to look it up, personally
[1:32:54] <%oneimportantthing> The game literally tells you being a pacifist will gain you nothing
[1:32:56] <slipdog> Tranquility Lane
[1:32:58] <Seithri> difficulty changes health values too
[1:33:06] <%Shad0wTag> @catpurnicus Yes except story mode difficulty
[1:33:13] <Seithri> they don't tell you that it does though
[1:33:14] <%RigmaroleHM> It gains you the pride of being a pacifist
[1:33:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Seithri yours or enemies'?
[1:33:24] <Seithri> both
[1:33:25] <zedravan> time to lab this fight
[1:33:30] <Yomamma1337> you can parry 2  projectiles diagonally connected
[1:33:33] <dukenux> it makes Kermit the Frog ascend to Heaven
[1:33:38] <dukenux> so imho worth it
[1:33:40] <+ArtsyFoxo> SO what I'm guessing is there's the 3 endings: A) Pacifist B) Genocide C) 3 Gems (which is the secret/true/cool pro gamer ending, which involves doing murder anyways)
[1:33:45] <%oneimportantthing> We gonna be here all night LUL
[1:33:52] <+Jiggisnipe> being pacifist 1st doesn't seem like a problem cuz you get credits and then the same file is used to genocide
[1:33:53] <AppleBerryKitty> kermit LUL
[1:33:55] <Seithri> theres way more endings
[1:34:01] <HotSauceFiend> @artsyfoxo theres 5 endings...
[1:34:06] <Yomamma1337> left column has less bullets near it since its only next to 1 lane instead of 2
[1:34:06] <+Catpurnicus> this is a good boss to learn how to time switching lanes and absorbing
[1:34:08] <+ArtsyFoxo> Whew LAWDY
[1:34:09] <+PkSilent01> So why are we fighting Scott Cawthon in a rhythm game
[1:34:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @oneimportantthing at least it's a disco night then Kappa
[1:34:18] <shinichizio> @PkSilent01 He has the chaos emerald
[1:34:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Seithri Those are New Game + though
[1:34:23] <+Catpurnicus> because its mandatory if you want to do enough damage
[1:35:14] <AppleBerryKitty> even i gotta admit this is tuff as hell
[1:35:14] <dukenux> im out of idea
[1:35:15] <%Shad0wTag> @pksilent01 Scott who?
[1:35:19] <Seithri> you need to be more aggressive during the streaming attacks
[1:35:20] <HotSauceFiend> is woolie hollowing out yet
[1:35:22] <dukenux> other than calling Minh for help
[1:35:30] <Seithri> otherwise dps is not enough
[1:35:32] <teefpal> The blue guy looks like scott cawtons avatar
[1:35:35] <Yomamma1337> yes
[1:35:36] <Awesome_Leaf> not optional im guessing?
[1:35:37] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:35:45] <Aussie_Manny> Maybe.
[1:35:46] <+RazeEmAll> it legit took me like two hours, WITH a break
[1:35:50] <slipdog> Are we killing now?
[1:35:50] <Treasure_Vault> Level up on weirdos first
[1:35:51] <+FirstSausage> Billy, cut it to when they beat this boss!
[1:36:01] <BlackermanZX> oh it looks legit hard
[1:36:02] <%Lion_kun> Do other content, lab him off screen
[1:36:03] <@Menitta> I just keep thinking of the glowing dude sitting at a restaurant
[1:36:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> It would really be a good idea to fight other souls first and come back to this when you're accustomed to fighting
[1:36:08] <+FirstSausage> Manipulate the time line!
[1:36:11] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @Treasure_Vault There is no leveling up
[1:36:12] <+projectmanatees> imquazKEKSmash
[1:36:12] <dukenux> @Menitta same
[1:36:12] <Yomamma1337> you can double absorb
[1:36:15] <rasamune> Yeah this fight is rough, I still haven't beaten it
[1:36:16] <AppleBerryKitty> @Lion_kun that works
[1:36:23] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you can warm up with other ''victims''
[1:36:30] <%oneimportantthing> Just go easy mode seriously, or practice elsewhere
[1:36:35] <teefpal> It might be better to do the rest of genocide and then come back.
[1:36:37] <Yomamma1337> you can
[1:36:59] <Yomamma1337> absorb, shift, absorb works
[1:37:03] <BlackermanZX> i just saw a kill run of this boss and its just nonstop shooting
[1:37:07] <+TheOlMitcheroo> @WoolieVersus If you press the bumpers you can dodge and absorb in the same action
[1:37:10] <slipdog> try tapping down and side same time
[1:37:12] <%Mr_Pylon> As a first Kill this seems like a really hard Kill
[1:37:25] <Yomamma1337> absorb shift absorb works
[1:37:36] <+maria_luke> It works
[1:37:56] <HotSauceFiend> @mr_pylon this counts as a really hard optional boss necessary for A endijg, not THE ending
[1:38:07] <+Catpurnicus> you get to know what distance you need to absorb - shift - absorb
[1:38:33] <%Mr_Pylon> @HotSauceFiend Yeah I stopped after Frog in my playthrough so lightman is new to me
[1:38:43] <LunarRemix> This is very likely the hardest fight in the game
[1:38:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah try tree dude first
[1:38:58] <+Catpurnicus> you gotta be hungry to absorb those yellow notes
[1:38:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:16] <dg4ii> @LunarRemix not exactly
[1:39:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> The fight after these gems is a BIG Wall, so waiting to do it until later is a good idea
[1:39:28] <Awesome_Leaf> are these set patterns or randomized?
[1:39:34] <ignaeon> Frog and some of the secrets are so much worse.
[1:39:35] <Yomamma1337> you can memorize when the red appears in a specific column and shoot there when for most of the shots
[1:39:57] <+Catpurnicus> basically once you get the 2nd shot, you usually need to switch lanes or a wall will block you
[1:40:01] <HR_Freud> FEEL THE MUSIC MAAAAN
[1:40:04] <ordnavi> @awesome_leaf set patterns
[1:40:32] <Awesome_Leaf> ty
[1:40:33] <%oneimportantthing> BECOME ONE WITH THE BANGER
[1:40:39] <Zephyr1989> heya! thanks for the support dudes!!
[1:40:54] <%Shad0wTag> We becoming one with L.O.V.E yet
[1:40:58] <Triplicat> even if he gets the gems the final boss of gem ending is also pretty hard lol
[1:41:05] <%Proxzo> I feel like being more aggressive with shooting would be good.
[1:41:07] <Yomamma1337> @Triplicat way harder imo
[1:41:14] <Zephyr1989> lol
[1:41:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Triplicat woolie overcame frog, i believe
[1:41:30] <Yomamma1337> @Triplicat frog is easier than what comes next imo
[1:41:32] <%Proxzo> Did woolie beat incinerator?
[1:41:41] <%Shad0wTag> @proxzo no
[1:41:43] <ordnavi> gem boss way harder than frog
[1:41:45] <+Catpurnicus> Woolie, look at this as a sonic bonus level, but instead of rings its absorbing shots lol
[1:41:53] <Zephyr1989> gl woolie!
[1:41:53] <%Proxzo> Can you jump shoot in this game?
[1:41:59] <FrostedZaibatsu> Love how its a low low poly model but the bloom is making it round
[1:42:05] <+Catpurnicus> get GREEDY
[1:42:19] <dg4ii> @Proxzo incinerator is far harder than any other fight in the game
[1:42:34] <Yomamma1337> @Proxzo idk about that, but the first rng section is bs
[1:42:36] <zedravan> @FrostedZaibatsu it has a nose too but the bloom hides it
[1:42:44] <EL_TRO> look at him go
[1:43:15] <dg4ii> just by nature of part of the incinerator being RNG means you can't practice for it. You just have to get really good, which SUCKS.
[1:43:26] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> ever played Amplitude? it's a very difficult rhythm spaceship game with truly unhinged EDM mixes
[1:43:40] <+Mrbaconator> this song slaps harder than russian slap boxing
[1:43:42] <Yomamma1337> red appears in the middle on the 2nd, 5th, 10th, and like the 15th wave
[1:43:58] <Yomamma1337> def easiest shooting column
[1:44:00] <dg4ii> No hit incin is why I have up on 100%ing this game
[1:44:05] <dg4ii> *gave up
[1:44:11] <+BigBruthaThunda> walls are so annoying
[1:44:45] <nyacoo> doing great
[1:45:09] <+Catpurnicus> damn hes getting more shots on this part than the beginning
[1:45:18] <Mr_Rakjo> Thats better
[1:45:19] <zedravan> closer
[1:45:19] <%Lion_kun> You got him to 60
[1:45:19] <%Proxzo> better!
[1:45:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> jeez that's a tight dps check
[1:45:23] <BlackermanZX> getting better
[1:45:25] <+RazeEmAll> finishing is still good
[1:45:25] <%Indigo_Automaton> 2/3rds down
[1:45:27] <Awesome_Leaf> nice run!
[1:45:27] <%Shad0wTag> Leave him for later
[1:45:28] <Yomamma1337> you have to really push the limits of parrying
[1:45:34] <thinktank1> NOT WORTHY
[1:45:35] <HR_Freud> get worthier through murder
[1:45:37] <+Jiggisnipe> yep this is dps
[1:45:38] <%oneimportantthing> Lmao
[1:45:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Definite improvement
[1:45:44] <+El_Rabbit> NOT W O R T H Y
[1:45:45] <nyacoo> not dying and getting 60% is progress
[1:45:46] <+DreyfussFrost> Saw the whole song at least. Just have to optimize now.
[1:45:54] <+BigBruthaThunda> watching this makes me feel good about lowering the difficulty LUL
[1:45:56] <+PMAvers> Really feels like you've gotta sleaze out every hit you can.
[1:46:00] <Artoo__The_Me> Damn I’m late! Did frog happen???
[1:46:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:01] <AppleBerryKitty> so he has to think of this as playing3rd strike huh?
[1:46:01] <BlackermanZX> its around 1 shot per 2 secs-ish
[1:46:03] <teefpal> Woolie, this is the second hardest boss in the game
[1:46:06] <+Catpurnicus> Such a lust for absorb
[1:46:08] <Yomamma1337> imo come back later, but you do you
[1:46:10] <%oneimportantthing> Go kill other things Woolie
[1:46:11] <ChronoRomancer> this static is killing the bit rate
[1:46:17] <+vaderxyz1970> You can lower your difficulty to save sanity
[1:46:22] <teefpal> And the boss for the gem ending is the hardest boss in the entire game
[1:46:37] <@Menitta> idk why this music makes me think of Derezzed
[1:46:37] <%oneimportantthing> There's no shame in story mode to progress
[1:46:39] <HotSauceFiend> difficulty doesnt improve your dps
[1:46:45] <+Catpurnicus> lol woolie is never going to touch that difficulty menu
[1:46:49] <0rnan> Wow, woolie got a lot better
[1:47:05] <+Catpurnicus> he can do this, he's already most of the way there
[1:47:21] <shinichizio> Seems like the kind of thing you'd have to memorize
[1:47:53] <Yomamma1337> you can still try if theyre close, just harder
[1:48:10] <HotSauceFiend> kinda memorization, but also its developing the habit of bouncing between 3 lanes and deflecting asap
[1:48:28] <dg4ii> @HotSauceFiend it makes it so you don't have to spend as much time of the fight being cautious/not risky
[1:48:53] <Yomamma1337> it barely ever hits the middle
[1:49:18] <HotSauceFiend> like completely avoid deflecting the red walls and focus om oranges as much as possible
[1:49:45] <zedravan> i think you would already killed it on Normal diff, if you got it to 30% since it seems to have -200 HP compared to on hard
[1:50:00] <HotSauceFiend> you dont HAVE to memorize where every note ks coming from, maybe just where the red notes are coming from. then deflect all the oranges around the reds
[1:50:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> get daigo parried son LUL
[1:50:48] <ChronoRomancer> The walls on the whole notes
[1:51:22] <rasamune> Yeah, you can memorize in broad strokes. Like, wall is coming on this next beat, wait to see where it is and then shoot around it

[1:51:23] <Aussie_Manny> We're on Hard?
[1:51:23] <Treasure_Vault> but we ain't normal
[1:51:27] <Treasure_Vault> we're a genetic freak
[1:51:27] <HotSauceFiend> main menu
[1:51:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> You have to lose the fight to change the difficulty
[1:51:38] <Yomamma1337> absorb move has less endlag than move fyi, you can double tap while moving if youre early
[1:51:40] <%oneimportantthing> Allow yourself the Normcore Woolsworth
[1:51:49] <HotSauceFiend> wooloe as
[1:51:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> But I don't think it's necessary, just fight this guy later
[1:51:54] <%Zero_Jacks> Keep the rhythm up after you find it
[1:52:03] <%livlinn> shiaWiggle shiaWiggle shiaWiggle
[1:52:07] <dg4ii> @Indigo_Automaton they're capable of doing it now
[1:52:14] <dg4ii> they just have to game hard
[1:52:21] <BlackermanZX> momma raised no bitch he keepin it on hard wooliePOYO
[1:52:26] <%oneimportantthing> The Ninja Gaiden of music games
[1:52:28] <rasamune> Like in this first part, you need to try and shoot once a measure if you can
[1:52:38] <%counterfeitgimmicks> I went and had lunch, can't believe he's still on this guy LUL
[1:52:39] <slipdog> maybe absorb-jump the double notes?
[1:52:43] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[1:52:44] <dukenux> since the last spike?
[1:52:45] <rasamune> @counterfeitgimmicks I can!
[1:52:57] <%jepupu> Starting the killing from an optional super boss does that
[1:52:58] <slipdog> This aint harder than sans tho DansGame
[1:52:59] <+Fefe41> how long have they been on this boss?
[1:52:59] <Yomamma1337> the spike hasnt even reached a peak yet lol
[1:53:00] <+Jiggisnipe> tbf you brought this upon yourself
[1:53:13] <+TheOlMitcheroo> But you're doing the hard ending and the secret ending before doing the default ending
[1:53:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[1:53:14] <Yomamma1337> yeah but it also tells you to kill people
[1:53:19] <rookechupie> from hard to sicko mode
[1:53:20] <dukenux> yeah, and hard IS hard
[1:53:20] <dg4ii> I mean i've seen people die several times to the tutorial frog fight
[1:53:31] <+Skelefellah> I mean for the record Woolz, you did a bunch of optional fights and did the offshoot ending in a row, too
[1:53:35] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It's not the difficulty setting lol, it's the order you're doing the fights in
[1:53:35] <Awesome_Leaf> is every note type absorbable?
[1:53:37] <+Catpurnicus> I mean so does every platinum game
[1:53:42] <HotSauceFiend> i died tons lf times to the dance club guy ziggs
[1:53:56] <dg4ii> including me, but I made up for it by getting to the second half of incin before giving up
[1:54:16] <Yomamma1337> @dg4ii second half is the hard part
[1:54:17] <zedravan> this is the one boss with the biggest HP spike fron Normsl to Hard it goes from 330 HP to 500 HP
[1:54:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:54:19] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:54:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> LUL
[1:54:25] <dg4ii> @Awesome_Leaf blacked out notes can't be grabbed but there are no blacked out notes in this fight
[1:54:28] <rasamune> @Awesome_Leaf Only black notes cannot be absorbed
[1:54:31] <UnderpaidBob> LUL
[1:54:32] <+Jiggisnipe> Smug Reggie
[1:54:33] <+mdrenny1321> LUL
[1:54:39] <dg4ii> @Yomamma1337 YOU'RE the hard part ):<
[1:54:43] <Awesome_Leaf> good to know ty
[1:54:55] <rasamune> Some notes you can absorb but it's a bad idea because there's ninety notes stacked up behind it
[1:54:59] <Awesome_Leaf> so walls are fair game too
[1:55:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> Don't change the difficulty. But you are making things harder on yourself than they need to be by choosing to fight these super bosses first before fighting regular enemies
[1:55:23] <Awesome_Leaf> @rasamune lol makes sense
[1:55:34] <nyacoo> On a roll
[1:55:40] <+K4TL0N> Reggie should be dancing
[1:55:44] <Yomamma1337> @rasamune no, absorbing those notes is needed
[1:55:47] <dukenux> i just had a kinda gross idea
[1:55:57] <AppleBerryKitty> isn't that a thing with them tho?
[1:55:57] <BlackermanZX> he is kinda getting the dps though
[1:56:05] <HotSauceFiend> @dukenux play guilty gear instead?
[1:56:07] <Seithri> he is absolutely getting the dps
[1:56:08] <ordnavi> normal enemies are gonna be easy work after this
[1:56:08] <dukenux> but this looks a bit like hes throwing glowing nail clippings at you
[1:56:16] <BlackermanZX> he only needs to avoid the walls
[1:56:23] <Darkdrill> Reggie - Easy mode is now selectable  '' Hell NO'' woolieYIKES
[1:56:51] <dukenux> can't go easy with HARD CORE beat like this
[1:56:53] <Awesome_Leaf> wasting a lot of damage opportunities during the breakdown
[1:57:01] <Seithri> he's finally going hard during the stream attacks
[1:57:09] <WaifusSansFrontieres> you know that tetris tech where you get a pice into a gap by moving at the last frame? that tech applies with absorbing in long note strings
[1:57:23] <AppleBerryKitty> any diff between pink and red walls?
[1:57:28] <rasamune> No
[1:57:33] <Yomamma1337> @AppleBerryKitty theyre different colors
[1:57:43] <WaifusSansFrontieres> functionally no, they are just tied to different notes in the song
[1:57:43] <Seithri> they are aesthetically different
[1:57:43] <AppleBerryKitty> well thats strange
[1:57:57] <Awesome_Leaf> well, one is pink and one is red
[1:57:59] <WaifusSansFrontieres> so you know which ones come by listening to the song
[1:58:03] <Yomamma1337> @AppleBerryKitty you need two of the same color to damage the enemy, like bejewled or something
[1:58:03] <HarshNerf> i can't tell what the game is here,why is he taking damage
[1:58:14] <HotSauceFiend> @has
[1:58:18] <AppleBerryKitty> ok now that makes more sense, thanks
[1:58:22] <Darkdrill> man this is no joke
[1:58:29] <BlackermanZX> hes getting closer to it
[1:58:41] <HotSauceFiend> @harshnerf game is to dodge the notes flying at you and deflect notes to dmg the light guy
[1:58:42] <Seithri> this fight made a guy i was watching quit the entire game lol
[1:58:43] <Awesome_Leaf> @AppleBerryKitty ahhh this is what i didnt understand
[1:58:44] <teefpal> I love how woolie is fighting the hardest bosses first
[1:58:46] <ChronoRomancer> @HarshNerf if he's on the note and doesn't time a button to absorb/deflect, he takes damage
[1:58:47] <hdroark> you can do it wools!!!
[1:58:50] <Kalmana> @Darkdrill Its a tough fight. Took me a long time to beat this boss
[1:59:00] <hdroark> we belove in you!!
[1:59:04] <hdroark> and belive
[1:59:11] <HarshNerf> @chronoromancer ahh ty for the explanation. i thought it was a guitar hero clone
[1:59:24] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I almost want him to skip this, do the normal ending and come back to it
[1:59:27] <%counterfeitgimmicks> At least the restarts are fast
[1:59:28] <HarshNerf> @hotsaucefiend ty
[1:59:35] <teefpal> Minh is gonna go crazy from editing this
[1:59:36] <bionicwillpower> man this fight is so insane
[1:59:37] <Yomamma1337> middle plus middle right is best imo
[1:59:39] <HR_Freud> feel the LOVE
[1:59:51] <Yomamma1337> you can absorb shift absorb there
[1:59:52] <Seithri> some people have to beat something that challenges them
[1:59:56] <0rnan> This does seem like skipping early to one of the harder parts of the game.
[1:59:57] <Yomamma1337> instead of standing in one lnae
[1:59:57] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I think Woolie would benefit from practice against the regular enemies
[2:00:13] <+K4TL0N> DANCE REGGIEEE
[2:00:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:21] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE
[2:00:24] <Jaysky> Remember the other day when Woolie said it would be much easier to kill than to just survive? I member.
[2:00:33] <bionicwillpower> its legit either the second or third hardest section in the game
[2:00:35] <HarshNerf> practice is for scrubs
[2:00:49] <+Jiggisnipe> YEA REGGIE
[2:00:52] <+Jiggisnipe> YOU TRY
[2:01:00] <teefpal> LUL
[2:01:01] <zepelinnn1> Reggie with the 'pass me the controller bro'
[2:01:04] <+Skelefellah> The game's difficulty is appropriate, but you just did multiple back-to-back super bosses here beyond the main game, so it's no doubt gonna be painful since you're going from difficulty spike to spike
[2:01:04] <wqorst> 1st try lesgo
[2:01:05] <Jaysky> Reggie you gonna be slaughtered
[2:01:05] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie be a dick now LUL
[2:01:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie believes
[2:01:07] <HarshNerf> gamer god descends into the arena
[2:01:10] <Seithri> lol
[2:01:14] <0rnan> Reggie about to get smoked
[2:01:18] <Artoo__The_Me> NOW IS YOUR TIME WOOLIE
[2:01:22] <%counterfeitgimmicks> plz oneshot this reggie
[2:01:23] <+nightmare6997> 1st try here we go
[2:01:25] <%oneimportantthing> LUCKY REG
[2:01:48] <%Shad0wTag> ReggieVS LIVE
[2:02:06] <+JustToWatch> it would be an incredible bit if Reggie secretly bought this game on his own and had been playing it the whole time
[2:02:13] <Seithri> i can't believe this is where reggie dies
[2:02:32] <yeildingthought> @justtowatch minh is that you? Kappa
[2:02:45] <+projectmanatees> reggie got this
[2:02:49] <slipdog> bit?
[2:02:57] <+projectmanatees> he got the frog power
[2:03:08] <+BigBruthaThunda> Reggie the wise
[2:03:25] <HarshNerf> @slipdog joke
[2:03:28] <HotSauceFiend> if going elsewhere. leave this save file intact
[2:03:43] <Yomamma1337> the 2 diagonal pattern is too close together, everything else can be double parried
[2:04:59] <+projectmanatees> if reggie beats this before woolie i'll gift 5 subs wifiHOMEGALUL
[2:05:08] <HotSauceFiend> yeah this is thr kinda dps you need. little bit faster
[2:05:42] <BlackermanZX> oh shit
[2:05:45] <dukenux> hes honestly doing great, already got half
[2:05:49] <HarshNerf> it speeds up? NotLikeThis
[2:05:50] <+BigBruthaThunda> Reggie actually pretty good
[2:05:54] <+vexion_smh> awww
[2:05:59] <Mr_Rakjo> Pretty good reggue
[2:06:04] <Yomamma1337> reggie is understanding the tech
[2:06:04] <Seithri> oh man reggie is heavily out dpsing woolie
[2:06:20] <HR_Freud> reggie bustin out the skills for his last stream ever
[2:06:22] <rasamune> It doesn't speed up, it just gets more chaotic as it goes
[2:06:24] <%Lion_kun> I think Woolie kicked it down to normal though
[2:06:28] <HarshNerf> woolie locked on too, learning the patterns
[2:06:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie evolving into Reggie BLANCO
[2:06:44] <@Menitta> After a certain point in the song, its probably impossible to succeed if you don't have it down by enough health I imagine
[2:07:19] <dukenux> WoolieSHOOK Tank vs WoolieKICKDAD DPS buld

[2:07:56] <HarshNerf> i don't like this idk
[2:07:57] <teefpal> Nah Frogs is much much better
[2:08:00] <%oneimportantthing> Half of this LP will be light bender lmao
[2:08:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> Two different genres so it's sunjective
[2:08:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I prefer kermit but this isn't bad I think
[2:08:05] <@Menitta> It's not as hype as frog's. There is a distinct difference between good and hype.
[2:08:06] <+BuckySmalls> You can do ittt! PowerUpL CoolCat PowerUpR
[2:08:07] <%Indigo_Automaton> *subjective

[2:08:31] <Bl4kDynamite> What ending are we playing for chat?
[2:08:34] <+Krasmeyts> Europe on blast, it will not recover from the d a m a g e
[2:08:41] <+BigBruthaThunda> ATM song is obviously the best Kappa
[2:08:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> i like both, but this type of song fits with the whole aesthetic of the character

[2:10:31] <HarshNerf> AlienDance
[2:11:11] <+FirstSausage> pretty damn close!
[2:11:11] <@Menitta> That was me with Sayonara Wild Hearts @birddotexe
[2:11:15] <Seithri> SO CLOSE
[2:11:18] <nyacoo> F
[2:11:19] <%Prevot> totally doable
[2:11:19] <+BuckySmalls> Oh man that hp was good
[2:11:21] <@Menitta> but then I played it
[2:11:21] <BlackermanZX> that was close and painful LUL
[2:11:29] <AppleBerryKitty> that was relly good
[2:11:29] <%livlinn> Close one
[2:12:03] <ChronoRomancer> he's starting to believe
[2:12:03] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Reggie motivated him lets goooo!
[2:12:05] <%counterfeitgimmicks> !motivated
[2:12:05] <@Moobot> @counterfeitgimmicks 2502 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:12:09] <HarshNerf> the more you listen the more it grows on you
[2:12:18] <dukenux> don't, just keep blastin
[2:12:37] <teefpal> @HarshNerf muscial stockholm syndrome
[2:12:44] <%Lion_kun> Are they still on hard?
[2:12:52] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Yeah still on hard
[2:13:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thank you woolie i needed something new to replace the Pandaemonium raid music in my head
[2:13:18] <%Lion_kun> Reggie did pretty good then.
[2:13:22] <+DreyfussFrost> I think it's the dodge backs that are the downfall.
[2:13:26] <QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! have you tried setting it to wumbo
[2:13:56] <teefpal> They are gonna blitz the rest of this game once they get the gem ending
[2:13:58] <+DreyfussFrost> It's always grab, move, grab, move back, but the next opportunity to grab usually comes in the lane you moved into.
[2:14:37] <Champstice> I'm late, Woolie engaging in the "Do A Murder" route?
[2:14:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:55] <Yomamma1337> @Champstice still no lol
[2:14:56] <ChronoRomancer> @Champstice yes, starting with a superboss

[2:15:03] <BreakfastSampler> @Champstice otherwise known as 'playing the game'
[2:15:05] <Yomamma1337> @Champstice hes still going for gems
[2:15:07] <HR_Freud> how long have we been on this boss for?
[2:15:16] <Champstice> Ah okay. How'd things go with Frog btw?
[2:15:26] <BreakfastSampler> @Champstice frog got beat
[2:15:30] <BlackermanZX> woolz massacred the frog
[2:15:32] <+deltachief47> is he still doing the pacifist run on this guy?
[2:15:32] <Yomamma1337> @Champstice he had it down
[2:15:34] <dukenux> Frog went back to his home planet
[2:15:40] <QueequegTheater> 6
[2:15:44] <%holydeviant1> Frog gave the fuck up
[2:15:47] <Champstice> Cool cool. I assume if he's going for the gem he's prolly doing the thing related to that then?
[2:15:49] <+Jiggisnipe> @deltachief47 naw murder time
[2:15:52] <%counterfeitgimmicks> It doesn't seem like this guy has the option to be pacified?
[2:15:54] <HarshNerf> AlienDance
[2:15:57] <+deltachief47> sadge
[2:16:00] <Yomamma1337> @Champstice he doesnt know whats after it
[2:16:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @deltachief47 pacifist arc is completed, now murder arc begins
[2:16:11] <BreakfastSampler> @counterfeitgimmicks well, you could just not kill him before the song ends, but that won't get you anywhere
[2:16:14] <Champstice> Ah.
[2:16:30] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Ye I saw that happen earlier
[2:16:32] <HarshNerf> AlienDance
[2:17:18] <+Demoli_PT> whats the lowest he got to?
[2:17:37] <%counterfeitgimmicks> I think Reggie has done the best so far LUL

[2:22:48] <%oneimportantthing> Dude, you've beaten Frog on hard. You've proven yourself. Just go down in difficulty
[2:23:27] <+Rafraud> Woolie Stunlocked PogChamp
[2:23:30] <+Jiggisnipe> can still save this for last
[2:23:31] <%counterfeitgimmicks> smh
[2:23:31] <taeko_ohnuki> finally
[2:23:34] <nyacoo> Yeyeye
[2:23:34] <+Rafraud> Lets gooooooooooooo
[2:23:37] <BlackermanZX> damn
[2:23:40] <Yomamma1337> you couldve just done murder stuff first
[2:23:40] <a_mad_dragon_> hallelujah
[2:23:43] <%Lion_kun> Easy mode is now selectable
[2:23:47] <+BuckySmalls> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:23:49] <%oneimportantthing> Y'all owe me one LUL LUL
[2:23:53] <Treasure_Vault> i guess, if you're N O R M A L
[2:23:54] <HarshNerf> the back down woolieEVIL
[2:23:55] <zedravan> enemy has less health
[2:23:57] <+BuckySmalls> Lets goooo :D
[2:23:58] <%counterfeitgimmicks> LUL
[2:24:00] <+Rafraud> I think hard mode should be a last thing we do on this run thing
[2:24:13] <+maria_luke> @lion_kun LUL
[2:24:23] <BlackermanZX> apparently hard mode is 500 hp while normal is 330 hp
[2:24:36] <zedravan> still a lot of health
[2:24:48] <@Menitta> Imo, devs shouldn't really say to do hard because they're too close and know how everything works going in but that's me
[2:24:50] <+maria_luke> so he needs 33 hits
[2:24:56] <@Menitta> As a first run at least
[2:25:10] <UnrealStyrofoam> M o t i v a t i o n ! . . .
[2:25:12] <nyacoo> way faster
[2:25:16] <HarshNerf> @blackermanzx seeing as how they are consistently shaving off 200 hp and falling, that isn't gonna help them woolieYIKES
[2:25:17] <%holydeviant1> @Menitta this is why you hire playtesters
[2:25:28] <Yomamma1337> @Menitta hard is perfectly fine, its just that woolie is starting with the super bosses before doing regular content
[2:25:38] <Triplicat> ^
[2:25:42] <dukenux> Valve playtesters?
[2:26:05] <+BuckySmalls> Akuma on Evil Within flashbacks
[2:26:13] <@Menitta> sure but even still I wouldn't limit that comment to just Wverhood
[2:26:17] <HarshNerf> RareParrot IceCold
[2:26:26] <%holydeviant1> Imagine having a song playbar in the UI for this sort of fight, the stress would be cataclysmic
[2:26:49] <Yomamma1337> you can just come back
[2:26:54] <%counterfeitgimmicks> smh my head
[2:26:57] <teefpal> This is the second hardest boss
[2:27:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> Please just return to this later
[2:27:05] <+Rafraud> Come back and see me when you're stronger
[2:27:06] <nyacoo> e a s y e a s y e a s y
[2:27:07] <%emptyantics> Did he beat frog?
[2:27:09] <HarshNerf> FeelsOkayMan moving on
[2:27:14] <%livlinn> spaceyeenOrb
[2:27:14] <zedravan> you have to beat him then
[2:27:18] <BlackermanZX> frog is ded
[2:27:29] <Champstice> @teefpal Nah it's like. 4th
[2:27:32] <+casy_fair> long live frog
[2:27:36] <UnrealStyrofoam> Take a break and come back to it
[2:27:40] <Yomamma1337> do the other ending first, makes more sense than just doing all of the super bosses in a row
[2:27:40] <+Rafraud> This is powerleveling for the easier fights @WoolieVersus
[2:27:50] <+Jiggisnipe> save it for last
[2:27:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> doodCrazy
[2:28:12] <Darkdrill> nah your totally right this seems way to hard for a few try's

[2:31:53] <Treasure_Vault> is killing the save first an awful idea?
[2:32:02] <dukenux> so that lantern could live
[2:32:07] <OkamiDude15> the lantern didnt have a soul
[2:32:09] <Champstice> YEAH
[2:32:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> Killing savepoints is optional

[2:34:23] <Zeneeba> right at the end....
[2:34:26] <@Menitta> I think my perception of this game is skewed because 70% of what I've seen was the two superbosses LUL
[2:34:29] <dukenux> no money?
[2:34:29] <Yomamma1337> DIDNT EVEN COUNT
[2:34:35] <nyacoo> optional

[2:35:15] <velgaduere> what, the lamppost can't dance? smh
[2:35:16] <+Jiggisnipe> that's what the game says
[2:35:18] <nyacoo> Not those, because they're not real, i guess
[2:35:21] <dukenux> lamp posts seem to be okay tho
[2:35:23] <BreakfastSampler> it only feels bad because you associate death with negative feelings
[2:35:27] <Mr_Rakjo> SET THEM FREE
[2:35:28] <teefpal> Thanks game
[2:35:28] <ignaeon> nobody tell him
[2:35:28] <%oneimportantthing> NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO DIE

[2:35:42] <Darkdrill> VoHiYo time for murder and cry BibleThump
[2:35:43] <velgaduere> this game wants to to disassociate loss from death

[2:36:09] <+Jiggisnipe> does Rasta want to die?
[2:36:10] <DXLelouch24> Chat expect BB Demake LP to take atleast 1-2 more sessions. I found alot of extra stuff.Including a dev room with stuff that opens even more stuff.
[2:36:13] <ignaeon> that is an option worth trying
[2:36:13] <Onamar> Stop overthinking it
[2:36:14] <$ArCielArDor> the ATM counted
[2:36:18] <Artoo__The_Me> Naw just kill everything
[2:36:19] <Darkdrill> LUL who wants to die
[2:36:19] <+theoldone001> No one on their deathbed wish they worked more
[2:36:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> No the ATM and save pooints aren't real beings
[2:36:21] <+Jiggisnipe> he see med like he wanted to kill you
[2:36:24] <BreakfastSampler> also yeah you're overthinking this
[2:36:28] <$ArCielArDor> also that's a count of souls
[2:36:28] <teefpal> Only a few actually want to die, the rest are just ambivalent
[2:36:29] <LunarRemix> You shouldn't overthink it. Some are just like that. It has no impact on the ending
[2:36:31] <dukenux> i think the game only counts npc dudes for clarity's sake
[2:36:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> NotLikeThis
[2:36:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat chill let him figure it out
[2:36:36] <teefpal> YOU HAVE TO KILL EVERYONE

[2:40:24] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus doesnt matter who you kill specifically
[2:40:25] <avihaltmann> @nyacoo true true
[2:40:33] <Kalmana> @nyacoo More or less
[2:40:36] <Mr_Rakjo> Pacifist, Genocide (EVERYONE), GEms, Hallway , NG+ & NG+2
[2:40:44] <+maria_luke> Genocide gets New Game Plus
[2:40:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> killing is badong
[2:40:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> Pacifist, Kill Eveything, Gem Ending, Hallway Ending, New Game + Endings
[2:40:55] <dukenux> Killing is badong, but sometimes is  gnodab
[2:40:56] <AppleBerryKitty> not wasting people times on a stream brother
[2:41:07] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Kill everyone, get the 3 gems, NG+ door is all you have left
[2:41:08] <vedajuno> genocide, pacifist, gems, corridor, new game +, new game + different
[2:41:10] <zedravan> sparing selectably only matters for a new game+ ending
[2:41:11] <+projectmanatees> Pacifist, Genocide (EVERYONE), GEms, Hallway , NG+ & NG+2
[2:41:23] <Yomamma1337> you dont have to spare specific people
[2:42:02] <+PopotoGaius> I came into this like "Is this the undertale liek game woolie talked about" and yes, yes it is
[2:42:20] <Artoo__The_Me> GOT BODIED

[2:44:49] <Triplicat> DPS race in some of them, not all of them
[2:44:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yeah slap the glasses off his face
[2:44:53] <+Skelefellah> @cobalt_phoenix_ Just the light guy - the normal fights loop
[2:44:59] <charles_olmstead> Found you guys from your Disco Elysium let's play, really enjoy your content
[2:45:16] <%holydeviant1> @charles_olmstead Now there's an enviable backlog
[2:45:17] <Mysticnamja> Sourpls
[2:45:22] <Mysticnamja> SourPls
[2:45:30] <Yomamma1337> @cobalt_phoenix_ some of them are.  one of the secret bosses he hasnt seen yet also has one
[2:45:33] <Mysticnamja> smear frames
[2:45:44] <avihaltmann> I can't believe this game predicted the death of scott cawthon
[2:46:14] <benjehuda> SourPls
[2:47:02] <BattAttack> omg this game is great!
[2:47:08] <%Shad0wTag> @avihaltmann who is scott hawthorne
[2:47:09] <BattAttack> Fun to see you playing this!
[2:47:12] <OkamiDude15> whole new game mode gotta figure it out
[2:47:14] <Mysticnamja> SourPls SourPls
[2:47:34] <avihaltmann> @Shad0wTag he made chuck e cheese
[2:47:35] <%X2Eliah> Man hard mode IS hard
[2:47:48] <Mysticnamja> nyansGroove nyansGroove
[2:47:58] <%Charronia> Hard is hard SilverNoted
[2:47:59] <Yomamma1337> theyre not trivial, helps them prepare you for the top 4
[2:48:02] <%The_Death_Owl> is this a fighting game?
[2:48:06] <dukenux> puts light guy in perspective tho
[2:48:11] <%Shad0wTag> @avihaltmann I'm extra confused on what that has to do with everhood
[2:48:15] <%X2Eliah> @The_Death_Owl This is a narrative crying game
[2:48:17] <OkamiDude15> @Shad0wTag five nights at freddy's creator, his avatar looks similar to the light being
[2:48:22] <Mysticnamja> theres two lifebars i guess it is
[2:48:41] <AppleBerryKitty> pandoraBANGG lytFILTH lytUSEGUN
[2:48:42] <%Shad0wTag> @okamidude15 Oh okay that makes more sense now
[2:48:56] <+PMAvers> Playing pacifist is like playing to the fighting game clock instead of trying to actually KO your opponent, I guess?
[2:48:59] <%X2Eliah> Naw, fighting games have lifebars side to side, here lifebars are top to bottom
[2:49:08] <nyacoo> It's not as harsh as the extra boss, so just don't panic
[2:49:12] <%X2Eliah> this is, at best, an orthogonal fighting game
[2:49:18] <avihaltmann> @Shad0wTag oh I thought you were joking too. Scott Cawthon made FnaF and his avatar bears a striking resemblance to the light being
[2:49:19] <VincentGraves> why not just lower the difficulty
[2:49:38] <%X2Eliah> @PMAvers yeah
[2:49:44] <%The_Death_Owl> we don't lower the difficulty here woolieMIRIN
[2:49:44] <Yomamma1337> @VincentGraves less fun, at least for me
[2:50:03] <%Shad0wTag> @avihaltmann No I was being serious, sorry if I was clear. Have the devs said its a reference?
[2:50:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[2:50:09] <OkamiDude15> @PMAvers yeah something like that
[2:51:04] <+Skelefellah> @Shad0wTag There's a trivia section on the wiki about it - the devs said it's purely coincidental since it stemmed from the Everhood Discord
[2:51:24] <Carlioo> it looks like woolie's trying way to hard not to go to the edges
[2:51:32] <Maids4lyfe> yocciJammer
[2:51:45] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I think Light Being ruined Woolie
[2:51:47] <%Shad0wTag> @skelefellah Thank you for explaining!
[2:51:48] <yayohawk> otzLurk
[2:51:50] <BattAttack> You can di it!
[2:51:52] <%X2Eliah> going to an edge limits your options
[2:51:56] <+TheOlMitcheroo> He's rushing to kill when this boss gives PLENTY of time
[2:52:14] <avihaltmann> @Shad0wTag i guessed as much, its just really funny to me, especially since scott became a hot button topic pretty short after

[2:52:46] <Carlioo> @X2Eliah well sure, but that doesn't mean you can never go there
[2:52:47] <%Shad0wTag> @avihaltmann Yeah I think what your referring to with what was found out about the guy
[2:53:24] <Artoo__The_Me> Optic blast!

[2:55:29] <Awesome_Leaf> get snapped
[2:55:29] <OkamiDude15> @taeko_ohnuki back to hard
[2:55:34] <Yomamma1337> it really doesnt help that its been a while and youve lost the muscle memory for the fights
[2:55:36] <Mysticnamja> SourPls
[2:55:49] <+projectmanatees> should read the fine print LUL
[2:55:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> Drafted by the BEAT
[2:55:50] <%X2Eliah> abandon course, return to frog
[2:55:52] <nyacoo> The rematches basically
[2:56:00] <Champstice> Hey go back into the club after leaving
[2:56:05] <Champstice> Just for a sec
[2:56:05] <ChronoRomancer> you got an ending, you can say you're done
[2:56:07] <Mysticnamja> u can kill a save point?
[2:56:10] <Videogomez> i recommend doing the castle first
[2:56:35] <zedravan> 2 slot is this run
[2:56:37] <BlackermanZX> is save 3# even needed
[2:56:45] <Champstice> 3 isn't needed, that's not a branch
[2:56:47] <Mr_Rakjo> No more branches woolie
[2:56:51] <Mr_Rakjo> just the gems
[2:56:53] <Mr_Rakjo> and genocide
[2:56:55] <dukenux> pacifist leaves other endings open, no?
[2:56:58] <teefpal> Save 3 isn't needed
[2:57:00] <nyacoo> save #1 is fine
[2:57:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> No more branches except the Gem ending
[2:57:07] <Champstice> What @Mr_Rakjo said
[2:57:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:57:11] <Seithri> 3 is absolutely something you need to keep for new game plus
[2:57:12] <nonexistentPumpkin> what I really don't like about the killing in this game is how awful the death sound is
[2:57:20] <+maria_luke> I mean we can see what happens in the treasury and then save over it.
[2:57:20] <Onamar> You can kill everyone and still go get the gem
[2:57:26] <Yomamma1337> you can get every ending from where you are now
[2:57:29] <%X2Eliah> sounds right
[2:57:31] <BlackermanZX> i think you're fine if you overwrite 3 right
[2:57:38] <%baronblank> 3rd save isn't needed, you have to get the arm
[2:57:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> Denying the arm changes nothing
[2:57:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> You already got the pacifist ending
[2:58:01] <Yomamma1337> in case you didnt use do pacifist first
[2:58:03] <+capybruhArt> figure out where the save files are and copy them lol
[2:58:08] <+maria_luke> because you didn't know
[2:58:08] <Champstice> Fake out
[2:58:10] <Mr_Rakjo> you chose to do that lol
[2:58:16] <hassanico2> I think nobody expected you to go so hard on pacifist
[2:58:18] <Yomamma1337> you started with pacifist
[2:58:18] <Mr_Rakjo> the arm doesnt give u anything
[2:58:18] <zedravan> you choose to do it
[2:58:20] <+sewermonk> woolz goin in circles
[2:58:22] <%TubeMan642> You can't play the rest of the game without arm
[2:58:27] <Videogomez> i forgot the question halfway through your question
[2:58:32] <hassanico2> wuh
[2:58:36] <+projectmanatees> yeah arm is needed for all other routes
[2:58:41] <hassanico2> Are Save points individual?
[2:58:41] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> There's no ignore the arm ending, you went super hard on pacifist first
[2:58:50] <Yomamma1337> you needed a save before you killed anyone for the pacifist ending, but you beat it so its no longer needed
[2:58:54] <+DreyfussFrost> I think it was a backup in case you abandoned pacifist.
[2:59:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> eet ees what eet ees
[2:59:10] <T_Sasquatch> Im sure google would help LUL dont trust chat
[2:59:14] <dukenux> what
[2:59:33] <rasamune> YES! KEEL
[2:59:41] <nyacoo> You'd probably get locked out of pacifist if you killed someone
[2:59:46] <dukenux> you should make polls for this for the future
[2:59:50] <hassanico2> @rasamune I love that  Family Feud clip
[2:59:59] <Mr_Rakjo> PARTY OVER
[3:00:02] <Videogomez> cool beat

[3:00:41] <Videogomez> undertale aint got shit on this part
[3:00:43] <dukenux> *chat
[3:00:43] <+sewermonk> your honor: undertale
[3:00:46] <OkamiDude15> no thoughts only undertale
[3:00:48] <shinichizio> Death sentence
[3:00:50] <Onamar> @sewermonk death
[3:00:52] <+Skelefellah> Remember Woolie: This isn't Undertale
[3:00:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> @sewermonk death
[3:01:03] <Yomamma1337> @dukenux you cant do a poll unless you already know potential answers the chat can make
[3:01:05] <T_Sasquatch> remember video games befoer undertale
[3:01:13] <+Skelefellah> LUL
[3:01:19] <teefpal> :(
[3:01:19] <hassanico2> It's the UBOA ROOM
[3:01:19] <+projectmanatees> you mean the yume nikki dude?
[3:01:20] <Yomamma1337> its the not-undertale
[3:01:23] <+Jiggisnipe> seems to be playing off it tho
[3:01:23] <smokin_mota> remember woolie: this is undertale
[3:01:26] <GuruStark> every quirky indie game is undertale and every difficult game is dark souls
[3:01:26] <GypsyMagi> It's not undertale but it would not exist if it weren't for undertale
[3:01:27] <%X2Eliah> it's chundertale!
[3:01:33] <hassanico2> Damn Undertale taking over even Yume Niki sprites :(
[3:01:35] <Triplicat> YOU MEAN THE YUME NIKKI DUDE
[3:01:38] <+Ricky_Rexx> remember woolie, Sans is in smash
[3:01:39] <teefpal> Poor lil gnome
[3:01:39] <+Skelefellah> Addendum: It's not Undertale when it's not Undertale~
[3:01:40] <+TheOlMitcheroo> This is anti-undertale
[3:01:41] <BlackermanZX> you men Uboa
[3:01:42] <+Mrbaconator> Underline
[3:01:44] <Videogomez> undertale except doesnt pull punches
[3:01:45] <dukenux> @Yomamma1337 but they do know since they rea- the universe tells them
[3:01:49] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It really isn't man, Lost Spirits are older than Gaster lol
[3:01:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's not undertale...IT'S TOUHOU!
[3:01:55] <GypsyMagi> I Can't Believe It's Not Undertale!
[3:01:55] <%townzzzzz> KILL
[3:02:06] <+CrownlessKitty> yume nikki getting swept under the rug smh
[3:02:10] <Yomamma1337> @dukenux yes but whats the point of a poll if chat has already told them
[3:02:14] <@Menitta> it's clearly Galaga
[3:02:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> BibleThump
[3:02:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> Which one?
[3:02:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LEFT
[3:02:24] <CoffeeCobra> BRUH :(
[3:02:26] <%emperordread> Double Kill
[3:02:27] <BlackermanZX> bruh
[3:02:27] <%livlinn> shandSad
[3:02:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I mean, right
[3:02:28] <+Jiggisnipe> kill or kill
[3:02:29] <count_bob> KILL
[3:02:30] <%townzzzzz> end it
[3:02:31] <Champstice> Yeah just like how all difficult action-rpgs are Dark Souls, this is Undertale!
[3:02:34] <+TheOlMitcheroo> FeelsBadMan
[3:02:35] <teefpal> :(
[3:02:35] <CoffeeCobra> NOT EVEN A FIGHT :(
[3:02:36] <dukenux> @Yomamma1337 chat tells them conflicting informations and they have to pick one
[3:02:38] <CoffeeCobra> FeelsBadMan
[3:02:45] <dukenux> :(
[3:02:46] <%shoryukenabotch> All you need is KILL
[3:02:50] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I love you Blue
[3:02:58] <+JustToWatch> yeah he sounds just sounds super pumped to die, definitely
[3:02:59] <+Jiggisnipe> omg the bloodlust
[3:03:00] <+PMAvers> Like, Blue's definitely shown to have had memory problems due to his extended age.
[3:03:01] <Yomamma1337> @dukenux there was no conflicting information there
[3:03:06] <nonexistentPumpkin> even people who ASK to be killed still get the violent death sound... there should be like a gentle wind sound
[3:03:07] <CoffeeCobra> forever in our hearts, Blue FeelsBadMan
[3:03:07] <rasamune> *snerk*
[3:03:20] <dukenux> @Yomamma1337 then why does he thinking chat epic trolled him
[3:03:22] <Champstice> Like I know the game wears its heart on its sleeve but c'mon, you can boil ANYTHING down to it being "hey remember Other Thing?!?!!?!?"
[3:03:25] <T_Sasquatch> FeelsBadMan There's nothing to kill
[3:03:27] <Zeneeba> blue...he was a goos boy after all
[3:03:29] <CoffeeCobra> NO, NOT YET

[3:06:07] <Zeneeba> some of these are hard, not because of survival, but just hard to bring down before their short aonga end.

[3:07:52] <Yomamma1337> for the record you dont have to double absorb here, dont think the dps requirement is that high
[3:08:11] <Videogomez> already failed the dps check
[3:08:15] <Yomamma1337> ill try it and check
[3:08:35] <BlackermanZX> i mean you got blocked like 4 times during the last run
[3:09:41] <Yomamma1337> just tried
[3:09:45] <Yomamma1337> you dont need to double tap
[3:09:47] <Onamar> you're getting hit and blocked a lot
[3:09:48] <nyacoo> Not getting hit is more important than double-dipping
[3:09:55] <Yomamma1337> just get 1 per wave
[3:09:55] <Darkdrill> this just seems unfair
[3:09:57] <Champstice> Yeah this one's a pain cuz the song is p short too
[3:10:07] <teefpal> woolieLORE
[3:10:10] <Zeneeba> you just have to stop gettin your later ones blocked.

[3:16:24] <shinichizio> Advanced seizure warning
[3:16:26] <%X2Eliah> yeah this is hard to look at LUL
[3:16:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> I was gonna say this game needs a massive warning if it don't haveone
[3:16:30] <@Menitta> A "This is what the warning is for" Warning
[3:16:36] <Enn19> You will -NOT- survive this seizure
[3:16:42] <CoffeeCobra> ah shit the molly water hit
[3:16:43] <nonexistentPumpkin> y'know what I find weird about this game? the lack of lore around why battles are Like This
[3:16:43] <%livlinn> PridePaint roryvaPop PridePaint
[3:16:47] <haitakaa> seizure warning even if you don't hav epilepsy
[3:16:56] <Champstice> Oh can't wait for Those fights to be Triple warnings
[3:16:56] <Zeneeba> if he thinks this one is bad with effects...uh oh
[3:16:58] <%Shad0wTag> ! EYES AT RISK !
[3:17:11] <nonexistentPumpkin> cognitohazard warning
[3:17:12] <DubDevilPlays> goin in bois SeemsGood Kreygasm
[3:17:27] <Champstice> God I love the bits where twitch just can't handle the bitrate
[3:17:37] <Zeneeba> the good part about this fight is its a fight til the death.
[3:17:50] <haitakaa> I wonder if this game is calibrated enough where you can beat it just going off of sound
[3:18:11] <%Prevot> this track reminds me of the greatest pokemon town theme, driftveil city from BW
[3:18:14] <Zeneeba> @haitakaa some songs you can. absolutely
[3:18:32] <Champstice> @Zeneeba It'd involve some hella pattern memory tho
[3:18:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[3:18:48] <Videogomez> stream is breaking
[3:18:55] <shinichizio> So if you turn on Colorblind Mode does this boss just die instantly?
[3:18:57] <royb2> daamnt these colours giving me a headache
[3:19:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> This feels crazy hard to keep track of
[3:19:09] <Zeneeba> @champstice mmhmm. the jump rope song is the easiest to so that with.
[3:19:32] <magnumlockjaw> @shinichizio The fight becomes the Four Kings mk.ll
[3:19:35] <Yomamma1337> @haitakaa the 'problem' is that youre not dodging in time to the song, instead the enemy is attacking to the beat of the song and youre dodging on a delay
[3:20:00] <%thedankestmeeme> wth this is epileptic jail bro
[3:20:02] <+theoldone001> If you guys are looking for a cool rhythm game to play try Sequence Storm, it's a racing lite game with beats and has a story. It's also F2p. It's so fun.
[3:20:34] <Zeneeba> @yomamma1337 which is why the jump rope one is perfect for that. cause the way that song is paced, you end up dodgin to the beat
[3:20:35] <Videogomez> there's a reason why he's the plant shop owner
[3:20:48] <%doctor_kelso> it feels like there was 0 thought put into note visibility in this game sometimes, lol
[3:20:59] <+Ricky_Rexx> dude what were in those brownies

[3:31:30] <Zeneeba> Chat. hear me out. a table top game with Green Mage ans Leshy.
[3:31:37] <CoffeeCobra> ironic how the best characters are green
[3:32:32] <CoffeeCobra> Green Mage is a pretty good representation of my ADHD at it's worst
[3:32:42] <nonexistentPumpkin> @Zeneeba I was JUST thinking Green Mage had some Inscryption GM vibes
[3:32:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:32:56] <hassanico2> this rules so much
[3:32:59] <hassanico2> GIT A LOAD OF THIS
[3:33:10] <mrtanaka111> he vibing
[3:33:11] <shinichizio> "Parry this, you casual"
[3:33:13] <+Mrbaconator> tenmamOvie

[3:33:20] <hassanico2> Too much drugs
[3:33:24] <%Charronia> esaIntended
[3:33:31] <+vexion_smh> tf
[3:33:32] <AppleBerryKitty> "we will go on a journey"
[3:33:35] <Zeneeba> @nonexistentpumpkin i would watch that game.
[3:33:49] <Videogomez> he is ascending
[3:33:50] <velgaduere> yo we cheatin??
[3:33:52] <Triplicat> GAMING
[3:34:03] <hassanico2> REEEESET
[3:34:10] <Videogomez> pityloop
[3:34:30] <Zeneeba> yup. green is a fight to the death.
[3:34:35] <nonexistentPumpkin> also, another point in Green's favor re: being the best character, Green's the one that ACTUALLY gets you to think "oh, maybe this IS a realm of maddened immortals and Frog ain't just BSing"
[3:34:35] <CoffeeCobra> DAMN CLOSE
[3:34:36] <nyacoo> can't pacifist your way out of this
[3:34:39] <+vexion_smh> aww
[3:34:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so close!!!!
[3:34:40] <%Charronia> Deadly doots
[3:34:48] <%X2Eliah> they can only be absorbed from below
[3:35:35] <peeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee> is woolie trying to kill this guy
[3:35:36] <+TwitchGuy2021> This music reminds me of “This is Halloween” for some reason.
[3:36:01] <Triplicat> HahaHide
[3:36:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the curves are so trippy
[3:37:08] <+Flarepulse> left for a bit, how did wools handle the light being situation
[3:37:24] <rasamune> He hit the bricks
[3:37:25] <ChronoRomancer> @Flarepulse he's going to retry later
[3:37:46] <RoxMoxie> Are the skull notes not doing  3/4 health? He got hit by two of them a bit ago.
[3:37:54] <%X2Eliah> need more caffeine
[3:37:57] <+Bobato_Chaps> this song is sick
[3:38:00] <+Flarepulse> good, that shit took me like 3 hours
[3:38:25] <rasamune> I still haven't beaten Light Being that fight is so demanding
[3:38:44] <nonexistentPumpkin> @peeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yup.  Green Mage is accepting it but he wants a grand battle first
[3:39:09] <rasamune> And I don't even know -how- I'm gonna do [REDACTED]
[3:39:18] <teefpal> You've got another loop so you can afford to chill a bit
[3:40:05] <%Shad0wTag> "This is Everhood, Everhood Everhood"
[3:40:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:40:06] <ShinyVagikarp> SourPls
[3:40:15] <Zeneeba> the super aggro ones like flower dude and green loop so you dobt have to be super aggro yourself
[3:40:18] <+Flarepulse> defeating redacted without changing the difficulty was my favorite gaming moment of 2021
[3:40:47] <Yomamma1337> @Flarepulse _________ or ___ ___?
[3:41:14] <+Flarepulse> the latter
[3:41:27] <Videogomez> lowering the difficulty only gives you more hp, and reduces their hp
[3:41:34] <Videogomez> no chart changes
[3:41:50] <BlackermanZX> is it looping or just a 2nd part
[3:41:59] <rasamune> It loops until one of you dies
[3:42:02] <Zeneeba> loopib
[3:42:04] <+Bobato_Chaps> @Videogomez that's sick, easy charts always feel worse to play
[3:42:04] <rasamune> Green Mage does not want to stop
[3:42:14] <Zeneeba> loopin* rather.
[3:42:27] <Videogomez> whats a few loops for an immortal anyways
[3:42:30] <+PkSilent01> So is this a new route?
[3:42:42] <+KingpinLarry> Did I come in on the final boss?
[3:42:45] <BlackermanZX> oh so no need to rush the fight
[3:42:45] <hassanico2> Oh that last bolt was dirty!
[3:42:48] <%X2Eliah> dangers
[3:42:55] <+vexion_smh> awww almost
[3:42:55] <+Flarepulse> looks like woolz learned some schmoves though
[3:43:02] <%Explodincatz> that last center lightning
[3:43:03] <+Roflmag> @KingpinLarry nope, still got some
[3:43:06] <nyacoo> it loops endlessly
[3:43:16] <%Charronia> @KingpinLarry No, this is just a regular fight
[3:43:42] <+shry7> what difficulty is he playing on?
[3:43:50] <Zeneeba> yeah. take your time on this one.
[3:43:56] <velgaduere> take your time, because that's what Green's doing
[3:43:58] <Zeneeba> hard i believe
[3:44:46] <%baronblank> Does this song end? I assumed the 'second round' bit meant it looped
[3:45:19] <velgaduere> @baronblank I assume not, and probably because Green is enjoying fighting you
[3:45:47] <velgaduere> nice warp section
[3:47:03] <Videogomez> do they know about the hallway?
[3:47:07] <rasamune> This is the guy who covered a length of hallway that takes four hours to traverse floor-to-ceiling with tally marks. He is NOT GOING TO STOP.
[3:47:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[3:47:36] <JonnyZeFox> holy shit I've never seen woolie and Reggie so focused
[3:47:42] <DXLelouch24> dont risk the curvy ones its not worth it
[3:47:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> @baronblank Yeah it loops
[3:47:49] <%Explodincatz> center lightning again
[3:47:53] <shinichizio> @DXLelouch24 This is intense to watch, even
[3:47:55] <Videogomez> @DXLelouch24 life advice
[3:47:57] <BlackermanZX> that last lighting was dirty
[3:48:05] <Zeneeba> @baronblank this song does not end. not until someone falls
[3:48:10] <teefpal> @rasamune One per year.  Guy takes infinite patience to a new level
[3:50:45] <Zeneeba> also to be fair, when youve gone mad from livin for an eternity, takin eight hours to put a tally mark on a wall and come back doesnt seem like a big deal
[3:50:46] <+Bobato_Chaps> it doesn't seem random at least, so maybe you can just learn the track like a racing game and just power through it
[3:51:26] <+shiokenstar> he's beginning to believe!
[3:51:48] <rasamune> Yeah there's no RNG in this game. Except in one character's spawn rate FOR SOME REASON >:(
[3:52:05] <+zephyboi> Is this what they call, Hood shit?
[3:52:14] <+shiokenstar> so close

[4:01:45] <DXLelouch24> he tryed to kill you in pacifist remember
[4:01:47] <CoffeeCobra> Rasta Beast specifically says 'we aren't friends' in his first fight LUL
[4:01:51] <DXLelouch24> FINISH HIM
[4:01:58] <Videogomez> killing rasta beast is a hate crime
[4:02:01] <hassanico2> You DISAPPOINT him so much.
[4:02:04] <mrtanaka111> yes
[4:02:09] <%X2Eliah> keeeellllllll
[4:02:09] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:02:15] <DXLelouch24> but Woolie needs CONTENT
[4:02:16] <Awesome_Leaf> completionist said so
[4:02:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> Damn Woolie is drowning in copium
[4:02:17] <dukenux> I mean yes, but actually no
[4:02:18] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Rasta totally wanted to die Kappa
[4:02:21] <DXLelouch24> blame Square Enix Rasta
[4:02:21] <CoffeeCobra> ah shit here we go again
[4:02:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SourPls
[4:02:30] <DXLelouch24> hes be playing FF6
[4:02:32] <@Menitta> I don't care if Rasta wants to die or not. I wanna kill
[4:02:33] <hassanico2> Lowish HP huh?
[4:02:34] <scrumbotime> HE WILL NOT HOLD BACK
[4:02:37] <Renzaku69> Ohhhh, you got your arm back. ok this all makes sense
[4:02:40] <BlackermanZX> god i can never unhear jojo stone ocean at the start of the song
[4:02:42] <AngryAsian5> KILL FOR CONTENT
[4:02:44] <%LastHazzerd> hell yeah, back to this song
[4:02:46] <velgaduere> gotta get that c o n t e n t fruit
[4:02:50] <mrtanaka111> wait,woolie dont know how to do the pacifist ending?
[4:02:52] <Videogomez> i actually did a cover of this song
[4:02:59] <+Jiggisnipe> @mrtanaka111 he did it
[4:03:00] <AppleBerryKitty> woolie likes metal
[4:03:03] <%Explodincatz> same
[4:03:06] <%Charronia> limesFine
[4:03:07] <dukenux> fuckin shre
[4:03:13] <dukenux> *shred
[4:03:18] <+theoldone001> Rasta Beast was the real hero all along
[4:03:19] <hassanico2> How tough is Rasta for survival fight?
[4:03:34] <dg4ii> wow they make that part look real easy huh
[4:03:39] <velgaduere> alright Reaper calm down
[4:03:39] <NetherTable> RASTAAAAAA
[4:03:40] <Champstice> idk what goes harder, this song or its title being WRATH OF GOD
[4:03:44] <%livlinn> aarong9Fire aarong9Fire aarong9Fire
[4:04:02] <DXLelouch24> CRAZY TALK
[4:04:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> stay alive
[4:04:06] <%zephyboi> Woolie feeding mid
[4:04:14] <hakumaribo> wait is it called wrath of god really?
[4:04:19] <%livlinn> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:04:28] <@Menitta> it's like the Good Place.
[4:04:30] <teefpal> both are pretty monstrous
[4:04:33] <DXLelouch24> wheres the fuck off to space option
[4:04:36] <+Jiggisnipe> if they don't ask, you're a monster
[4:04:37] <DXLelouch24> like Catherine
[4:04:43] <velgaduere> there is no ethical life-playing under Everhoodism
[4:04:47] <teefpal> It's an enforced binary choice with no grey
[4:05:05] <+TwitchGuy2021> Monster to keep people alive for ever.
[4:05:05] <mrtanaka111> rhasta is a dirty life-affirmer
[4:05:06] <RoxMoxie> You tried to keep everyone alive and got your ass beat by a metal frog.
[4:05:09] <CoffeeCobra> Rasta may be pretty flawed, if he cared so much, he'd see Green going insane or others being miserable
[4:05:12] <teefpal> @velgaduere P R A X I S
[4:05:13] <%HeroToxiko> he really said "shoot these"
[4:05:30] <+Jiggisnipe> he said a bunch of people died before when he fought you before
[4:05:31] <+theoldone001> "I'm no hero, never was never will, be. I'm just an old killer hired to do some wet work."
[4:05:33] <BlackermanZX> didn't he say you murdered a lot of people before
[4:05:34] <jett_eyes> song sounds different
[4:05:37] <CoffeeCobra> it's pretty logical to want to look away from your friends deteriorating and pretend it's fine
[4:06:20] <+Jiggisnipe> exactly
[4:06:24] <CoffeeCobra> Rasta is the sans of the story I guess and it does kinda get explained but SPOILERINOS :)
[4:06:25] <+Jiggisnipe> some can die some can live
[4:06:25] <+TwitchGuy2021> Wow, Reggie’s so judgy. We’re not horrible, we’re helping them 🙂.
[4:06:25] <Videogomez> I think he knows things are shit, but he's not capable of pulling the plug
[4:06:29] <+Jiggisnipe> but nope all genocide
[4:06:40] <teefpal> Yeah, it's just annoying
[4:06:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I mean to be fair death doesnt care
[4:06:54] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Neutral endings are for cowards
[4:06:56] <+S3xGAZEBO> the thing is they are not stuck, they have a suicide incinerator machine. I don't get how you are doing them a favor?
[4:07:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> The second you questions your motives you lost the war Woolie
[4:07:02] <@Menitta> Death is based like that
[4:07:07] <velgaduere> beginning to wonder how much is kayfabe and how much is people forgetting that this is a video game
[4:07:08] <NetherTable> we go all the way or we don't go at all
[4:07:13] <teefpal> Really this just shows Everhood needs some mental health experts to help deal w the ennui
[4:07:14] <+Jiggisnipe> some people like immortality
[4:07:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> They are stuck though cause people used the incinerator but still end up back here- hence the lost souls
[4:07:44] <count_bob> The moral of this game isn't "Immortality is great"
[4:07:51] <Videogomez> the crocodile that they just killed was also immortal, but paralyzed and unable to move forever
[4:08:11] <mrtanaka111> this is just moratl propaganda
[4:08:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:08:13] <+S3xGAZEBO> ok, so they have a dude with a kill arm. so when they are ready they can just ask him
[4:08:20] <+S3xGAZEBO> he doesn't have to force the issue
[4:08:28] <teefpal> @Videogomez why not magic up a wheelchair?
[4:08:45] <teefpal> We dont kill the quadreplegic and he could clearly still talk
[4:08:48] <velgaduere> dammit
[4:08:48] <JayCue_yt> ooh don't panic monkaS
[4:08:49] <zenith0111> Whoa this is sick
[4:08:52] <+Rafraud> FUCK
[4:08:52] <Videogomez> no pity loop
[4:08:54] <hassanico2> damn
[4:08:56] <BlackermanZX> damn
[4:08:58] <teefpal> So close
[4:09:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:09:07] <+Fetrigon> damn
[4:09:08] <shinichizio> Return of jams
[4:09:11] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Learn to parry lol
[4:09:12] <nyacoo> twas merely a joke
[4:09:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Rasta doesn't like it lol
[4:09:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> He earned his survival
[4:09:15] <+FlashTrickstar> Go to the theatre, light warrior is there
[4:09:17] <velgaduere> lobosJAM
[4:09:19] <Videogomez> there's another guy back there
[4:09:34] <Zeneeba> but he survives second time. when he first fought rasta, he got bodied several times.
[4:09:40] <BlackermanZX> you got this downloaded
[4:10:03] <velgaduere> ever so slightly more aggro
[4:10:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> Staying in one lane means you're misssing out on dps
[4:10:30] <+Jiggisnipe> BE B E AGGRESSIVE
[4:10:37] <Mr_Rakjo> i mean you kinda skipped the Forest Spirit fight
[4:10:40] <Mr_Rakjo> he explains shit
[4:10:40] <+S3xGAZEBO> the answer to the story might just be, bad writing
[4:10:50] <%Charronia> Kinda reminds me of Pillars of Eternity where Berath sends you on a similar murder quest
[4:10:52] <mrtanaka111> @S3xGAZEBO unfotunately
[4:10:54] <BlackermanZX> i mean in the end inmortality is gonna be suffering
[4:11:06] <Mr_Rakjo> nah the writing is ok woolie just did a lot of thing out of order so now he is questioning everything
[4:11:25] <teefpal> Didn't they already talk to the forest spirit?
[4:11:25] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Maybe you should actually complete the Genocide run before you decide there's something wrong with it lol
[4:11:34] <velgaduere> the answer to the story might also just be "concurrent perspective" and/or "ambivalence"
[4:11:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> EXACTLY
[4:11:38] <%Prevot> pick one of these pacifist or genocidal options or fuck off
[4:11:39] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:11:39] <Videogomez> there are answers at the end
[4:11:48] <nyacoo> Unless everybody else is trapped there with you
[4:11:55] <nyacoo> Then it's a trolley problem
[4:11:56] <teefpal> No spoilers
[4:12:02] <Mr_Rakjo> @teefpal yeah but since he did Pacifist as a first run he didnt fight him so he missed that dialogue also he didnt fight the skinny shroom
[4:12:08] <Zeneeba> there is kind of an answer. whether or not you like it, youll have to see
[4:12:12] <notmilician> Honestly, beat the game a few months back. The story is a mess, especially in the end. It throws a lot of concepts at you haphazardly, with an inconsistent message that seems to think it's the only valid one. Music is great, everything else was real rough for me in the end.
[4:12:19] <BlackermanZX> my guess is that eventually he is gonna regret not dying right now
[4:12:21] <+S3xGAZEBO> I mean, maybe the writers are just trying to force a game that doesn't really have a deep message to feel deep.
[4:12:39] <Scrummo> is this Undertale?
[4:12:48] <velgaduere> @Scrummo sure
[4:12:52] <zenith0111> Is Woolie doing good damage?
[4:12:54] <0rnan> @Scrummo yea
[4:13:06] <count_bob> @notmilician Really? I think the the message of the game is great and pretty straightforward.
[4:13:10] <teefpal> "Immortality is BAD guys!!!"
[4:13:21] <%ShackledRage> I think part of it is the message that they're all supposedly suffering, REGARDLESS of what they actually say to you
[4:13:35] <Yomamma1337> the game has told you hints via absolute truths
[4:13:41] <mrtanaka111> @ShackledRage but its not up to us to decide that
[4:13:52] <count_bob> I think that depends on how you view life philosophically
[4:13:57] <$ArCielArDor> so woolie finally manned up.
[4:14:11] <notmilician> @count_bob Wholeheartedly disagree, especially when you get into some of the reveals later on and the discussions before the finale. All of which is spoilers, but I came away incredibly negative and felt like the game barely even understood what it wanted to preach at me.
[4:14:44] <velgaduere> NICE
[4:14:45] <Mr_Rakjo> @ArCielArDor took a bit after defeating the frog he went around hte doors a bit trying to find more pacifist content but then after a bit he started fighting
[4:14:45] <Yomamma1337> AGAIN
[4:14:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> EEEYOOO
[4:14:46] <+Jiggisnipe> NICE'

[4:15:00] <velgaduere> sometimes it just be that way
[4:15:08] <%Indigo_Automaton> lolathonGroove
[4:15:08] <+S3xGAZEBO> I mean, you can kill people whenever, why don't you just euthanize them when they want rather than being like: no it has to be today!
[4:15:10] <+Comb711> SourPls
[4:15:10] <teefpal> YAY HAPPY END
[4:15:10] <Zeneeba> rastaaaaa.... BibleThump

[4:15:27] <punimissile> yoooo good song coming up
[4:15:28] <teefpal> MURDER BOOGIE
[4:15:29] <dukenux> i wouldn't treat "ending their lives" litteraly as far as the message goes
[4:15:36] <0rnan> @S3xGAZEBO Thats the real answer.
[4:15:38] <%Indigo_Automaton> The footprints are kinda wack at times
[4:15:50] <@Menitta> oh nice he beat it. had to take a phone call
[4:16:17] <Yomamma1337> @Menitta on the last note too
[4:16:24] <+TAFK> kill that save point!
[4:16:31] <+S3xGAZEBO> @0rnan ok I'm not alone on that lol
[4:16:48] <Zeneeba> ok this asshole. this is the one that i had a hard time with. the one that taugt me to be super aggro.
[4:16:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @S3xGAZEBO that's my thinking too
[4:17:02] <David_de_Bergerac> game fun?
[4:17:11] <+Jiggisnipe> oh is Cas real?
[4:17:17] <%Charronia> Hardwood :)
[4:17:18] <%townzzzzz> what song he got
[4:17:29] <velgaduere> 💃
[4:17:29] <+PMAvers> I mean, you need a wooden stake to kill a vampire
[4:17:34] <dukenux> clown music
[4:17:35] <notmilician> Yeah, the game waits a bit too long to give you clear reasoning as to why you're doing what you're doing. For a long time, you're basically stuck with, "Kill them because immortality is bad." And when you do get answers...eh. Interested to see you guys' opinions.
[4:17:39] <%townzzzzz> vamp boogie
[4:17:44] <Bedllama> leftiJammers
[4:17:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ok ok lil mans got hands
[4:17:47] <punimissile> Spell Card: Four Of A Kind
[4:17:47] <0rnan> Lads got a little jingle jangle to him
[4:17:48] <BlackermanZX> kill his jack frost lookin ass
[4:17:49] <+Jiggisnipe> oh no
[4:17:49] <velgaduere> THE SQUAD
[4:18:03] <0rnan> They really were other people this whole time.
[4:18:10] <%Charronia> A separate body for each of his identities cirD
[4:18:10] <dukenux> Killer 7
[4:18:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> Which one do I shoot?
[4:18:26] <Zeneeba> ludwig, jimmy, cassius....i forget the others
[4:18:31] <hassanico2> I hate all of them equally :)
[4:18:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> So did Woolie change from the pacifist route?
[4:18:49] <T_Sasquatch> Imagine getting jumped by somone with multiple personalities LUL
[4:18:52] <dukenux> so the Magic 8 Ball counts that as five, right?
[4:19:01] <velgaduere> shit
[4:19:03] <Zeneeba> no LUL
[4:19:04] <Videogomez> nooo
[4:19:06] <+Jiggisnipe> damn that sucks
[4:19:06] <+Rafraud> gottem
[4:19:06] <BlackermanZX> Damn
[4:19:07] <+vexion_smh> awwww
[4:19:07] <dukenux> almost
[4:19:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nuuu off by one
[4:19:08] <+TAFK> aw man, one away!!!
[4:19:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> like one hit away
[4:19:12] <shinichizio> TIM!
[4:19:13] <Justlaxy> I didn't know their was a time limit for these
[4:19:18] <tolloponik> dragons quest vibes with that one
[4:19:23] <0rnan> He's pretty easy mode compared to the others we've seen
[4:19:28] <velgaduere> @Justlaxy for most, it's til the end of the song
[4:19:34] <dukenux> also, like how he mentions "kind of wood"
[4:19:40] <dukenux> cause he's a vampire
[4:19:43] <Zeneeba> @justlaxy for some. others like green will go until someone drops
[4:19:43] <notmilician> I remember having more trouble with this guy than beast weirdly enough. Couldn't kill him fast enough, just tied like 3 times before getting him.
[4:19:58] <velgaduere> look at this mischievous little shit
[4:19:58] <dukenux> and what do you kill a vampire with? (besides sunlight)
[4:20:19] <mrtanaka111> dance moves?
[4:20:24] <Zeneeba> sick beats?
[4:20:24] <+TAFK> a silver bullett
[4:20:26] <+TAFK> garlic
[4:20:38] <Justlaxy> @velgaduere the gem was the one that taught me but I thought it was just that optional fight.
[4:21:31] <hassanico2> The bananas are safest to attack I think
[4:21:48] <Zeneeba> the problem with this fight is not just the length, but how many colors he throws out
[4:21:49] <+Rafraud> hee ho
[4:21:51] <mrtanaka111> hi ho hu
[4:21:59] <+Ricky_Rexx> His shadow clone jutsu is too strong
[4:22:11] <hassanico2> What does this track sound like anyway
[4:22:16] <%Double_Tap_That> @dukenux Steaks?
[4:22:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:22:19] <TheFramedWarlock> The rarer color is usually wider from what we've seen
[4:22:25] <notmilician> Man, all these nerds would be in the dirt if these songs just had a loop. Curse you ost length...
[4:22:27] <Bl4kDynamite> Kinda looks like he's flipping you off at the beginning

[4:55:59] <Zeneeba> you cant hit through walls
[4:56:11] <Zeneeba> even ones of the same color
[4:56:16] <TheFramedWarlock> No I mean like when there are 2 notes, one behind the other
[4:56:44] <CoffeeCobra> @TheFramedWarlock you mean two rapid hits? not really I THINK? I don't quite remember, but either way it's more damaging to save up two
[4:56:50] <CoffeeCobra> someone correct me on that
[4:56:54] <CoffeeCobra> I haven't touched Everhood in months
[4:56:55] <zedravan> this is only walls
[4:57:19] <%atlasdotwav> That actually makes sense for the character
[4:57:24] <Zeneeba> @coffeecobra you can, but only if their the same color i think?
[4:57:25] <HotSauceFiend> you can deflect the first note, but theres you can deflect the second note in those rapid fires
[4:57:40] <HotSauceFiend> you cant*
[4:57:47] <CoffeeCobra> thanks yall
[4:58:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> Grundall's got that Royal Guard
[4:58:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:58:13] <+the22cstomp> your mixup getting blocked
[4:58:14] <CoffeeCobra> I actually really like that you have to be strategic with it because just firing blindly wont do damage
[4:58:20] <Zeneeba> grundel is easy to survive, a pain to kill
[4:58:27] <Daxalog> he should be by 50% by the first lightning part
[4:58:39] <+EsperHubb> Hang in there! Don't get shmix'd!
[4:58:48] <%ItalianWaifu> yo wtf i've never seen this game is this rhythm combat
[4:58:55] <velgaduere> kill the pickleman
[4:58:58] <CoffeeCobra> @ItalianWaifu it sure is
[4:59:17] <rasamune> @ItalianWaifu Ish. You're not bound to a rhythm, but following the rhythm of the song helps
[4:59:26] <CoffeeCobra> that too
[4:59:34] <+meteor530> Gettni worse. Take a breather Woolie
[4:59:44] <trench2nowhere> Grundall: I'M FUCKING INVINCIBLE!!!
[5:00:23] <CoffeeCobra> it's really nice to see so many new people getting interested in this obscure little gem FeelsGoodMan
[5:00:30] <Videogomez> ngl at a point i just lowered the difficulty to kill them faster
[5:00:56] <RoxMoxie> I don't recall this fight being this tight
[5:00:57] <BlackermanZX> imagine getting mixed by grundell
[5:01:00] <magnumlockjaw> Grundalled
[5:01:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> GRUNDALL GOT HANDS
[5:01:09] <velgaduere> @meteor530 he's already said several times that he'll know when he needs a break
[5:01:16] <+BigBruthaThunda> @videogomez  same, it got silly
[5:01:20] <Zeneeba> @roxmoxie the walls really fuck shit up for some.
[5:01:20] <CoffeeCobra> tappin to your doom
[5:01:28] <AppleBerryKitty> still playing defense
[5:01:57] <hassanico2> He's got it
[5:02:04] <velgaduere> Grundall really does just say fuck it and throws out whatever
[5:02:06] <+meteor530> Ya this might be the one
[5:02:11] <velgaduere> nailed it
[5:02:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> WOOOOO
[5:02:14] <CoffeeCobra> Clap

[5:02:38] <Zeneeba> the hardest character to beat for me was purple mage.
[5:02:42] <CoffeeCobra> no fight with Robotnik :(
[5:02:55] <hassanico2> Ah so he was an Orange "Mage"
[5:02:56] <$ArCielArDor> soul stones
[5:02:58] <+Jiggisnipe> cuz he was a Mage?
[5:03:10] <+PMAvers> I mean, you've gotta replace a sense with a gem. Like, say, sight.
[5:03:34] <CoffeeCobra> a lot of the mages had sight replaced with a gem
[5:03:35] <rasamune> Good luck with whatever you are doing!
[5:03:44] <Videogomez> she can see the gasters
[5:03:46] <Zeneeba> yeah...this is a mercy kill...
[5:03:47] <velgaduere> uh
[5:03:50] <count_bob> So here's my counter to the "let people die when they want" they still want to be immortal, and to keep on doing what they were doing: Torturing innocent people.
[5:03:54] <BlackermanZX> monkaS

[5:05:31] <%rocktimusprime> woolieEVIL
[5:05:35] <velgaduere> she's also clearly deranged from abuse. her reaction might have just be instinctively fearful from her experiences with Professor Orange

[5:05:49] <velgaduere> but then, she realizes what you were doing

[5:06:00] <nyacoo> no soul
[5:06:09] <teefpal> So who is left?
[5:06:10] <Parapattern> Is fungus really 'alive' in the way we think of it?
[5:06:16] <rasamune> "You didn't need to do that, Red. But damned if you didn't so, nice work, I guess."
[5:06:24] <Zeneeba> @velgaduere thats how i see it
[5:06:36] <count_bob> Again. They want to stay immortal so they can torture people.

[5:36:56] <hassanico2> It's like, a nice ice cream flavor?
[5:37:01] <AppleBerryKitty> *cough kirby*
[5:37:03] <velgaduere> bubble gum is a substitute for nicotine imo
[5:37:03] <+vexion_smh> D: based
[5:37:08] <Samk235> This is what peak fighting game performance does kids, you know the games footsies
[5:37:08] <tolloponik> true

[5:37:14] <Zeneeba> gum sucks, and makes you hungrier
[5:37:15] <hassanico2> even the bubblegum with liquid centers aren't so good
[5:37:16] <a_mad_dragon_> who chews gum anymore
[5:37:17] <%baka_sugoi> Gum is good when ON DRUGS
[5:37:19] <teefpal> just get minty gum
[5:37:21] <%robosqueeb> bubblegum is delicious
[5:37:21] <@Menitta> chewing gum has an actual purpose at least
[5:37:24] <tolloponik> when the flavor is gone it becomes a chore
[5:37:28] <@Menitta> not sugar gum
[5:37:31] <T_Sasquatch> gum sucks in general
[5:37:34] <teefpal> Dont forget to kill the bubby
[5:37:41] <Dopamien> but you need the gum when the molly kicks in
[5:37:45] <+S3xGAZEBO> gummy bears are superior
[5:37:48] <Daxalog> how many layers of Puz are you on right now?
[5:37:49] <@Menitta> I can't live without mint chewing gum.
[5:37:56] <teefpal> Get gummy in my puzzy
[5:37:57] <Fabulich> Bubble gum doesn't have the same consistency it used to. it's too soft, I just want to eat it after a few chews.
[5:38:02] <+Rafraud> kill
[5:38:08] <+vexion_smh> KILL RABBIT

[5:40:17] <velgaduere> BEEG
[5:40:20] <@Menitta> gum*
[5:40:53] <+Rafraud> That's such a dumb point of view lmaooooooooo
[5:40:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[5:41:03] <teefpal> I'll say
[5:41:05] <count_bob> How is that dumb?
[5:41:06] <+biggerswole> lol fat beerus
[5:41:07] <velgaduere> @Rafraud I mean it's talking bubblegum
[5:41:10] <xerotwo> M E T A
[5:41:15] <BlackermanZX> thank you gum man *KILLS*
[5:41:17] <Awesome_Leaf> yo chat, how far are we from the end?
[5:41:17] <magnumlockjaw> Thank you Big Bubblegum Spirit
[5:41:23] <%Charronia> Who is to stop a god of death? SilverShrug
[5:41:30] <+theoldone001> woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL
[5:41:30] <xerotwo> ALL IMMORTALS MUST DIE
[5:41:32] <velgaduere> living in fear is not living
[5:41:35] <+Jiggisnipe> seems irrational to fear death when you can't die lol
[5:41:42] <count_bob> That's.....not what he said.
[5:41:42] <Yomamma1337> @Awesome_Leaf more than an hour
[5:41:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> Immortality is unnatural
[5:41:44] <yukichocomilk> that sounds like some EVIL talk
[5:41:45] <+Rafraud> Its dumb because the MC is "supposed" to decide for them
[5:41:45] <%arkv01> man this bubblegum just mad its stuck to some desk for eternity
[5:41:47] <tolloponik> wrong
[5:41:48] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Complete the route lol
[5:41:51] <Awesome_Leaf> thanks @Yomamma1337
[5:41:51] <+CrownlessKitty> they may not want to die. but, they must die.
[5:41:51] <+BigBruthaThunda> sure man
[5:41:54] <+Rafraud> When they do not want to be killed lol
[5:42:00] <hakumaribo> BBGS is wise, and trying to set you on the right path.
[5:42:01] <Make_me_mad> As someone who liked Baccanno, these guys just need to get over it and enjoy immortality.
[5:42:03] <SkeletAlpha> The fact their time should normally be limited gives it meaning
[5:42:08] <rjhascancer> "i swear they wanted to die your honor"
[5:42:09] <TheFramedWarlock> So is the whole point of the game just repeating "Immortality bad no matter what" ?
[5:42:11] <Dopamien> I'm a god. How can you kill a god? What a grand and intoxicating innocence
[5:42:11] <count_bob> That's not what he said at all.
[5:42:12] <teefpal> Don't forget the mages torturing everyone for eternity
[5:42:16] <0rnan> I wouldn't say all of the npcs were exactly living in fear.
[5:42:17] <velgaduere> ~wooooo paradox~
[5:42:22] <Yomamma1337> @TheFramedWarlock no
[5:42:25] <Zeneeba> i agree, but i also dont think its up to one person to be the judge jury and executioner
[5:42:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> fear is a natural part of life, whether you're immortal or not
[5:42:27] <meatling420> why bother fearing death if you live forever? literally just living in fear for no reason so just end it
[5:42:30] <+Rafraud> So duuuumb
[5:42:30] <Daxalog> Yeah but what if a good tv show got announced and came out Tommorow
[5:42:32] <+JWalnut> wasn't this literally the plot of P3
[5:42:37] <+tempestzephyr> spoken like a true Jrpg villian
[5:42:39] <Champstice> Wooooosh
[5:42:42] <+Jiggisnipe> @meatling420 it's so dumb lol
[5:42:44] <geekpatientzero> Well we'll never know until someone invents immortality in real life
[5:42:45] <Parapattern> "They say 'no', but you really mean 'yes'."
[5:42:45] <count_bob> Wooooooooooosh
[5:42:48] <+linkansum> Kirby looks like he belongs in Bubblegum Land... and you wouldn't hurt kirby, would you?
[5:42:49] <teefpal> - James from Silent Hill 2
[5:42:53] <TheFramedWarlock> The plot of P3 was that life matters regardless of inevitable death
[5:42:55] <tolloponik> he said death is inevitable and immortality is something that is not natural there fore death must come to them.
[5:42:56] <@Menitta> you should just stop doing
[5:42:58] <%emptyantics> “Another Indie game with a depressing story about death” Kappa
[5:43:02] <+meteor530> Well it's like people who want immortality not realizing how much grief there is in watching everyone you love and care about die around you over and over
[5:43:05] <Daxalog> Bubblegum spirit dont know shit
[5:43:08] <Videogomez> nothin about this is depressing
[5:43:16] <BlackermanZX> just live until you experience the heat death of the universe wooliePOYO
[5:43:23] <count_bob> @tolloponik You are 100% right.
[5:43:27] <+Jiggisnipe> @meteor530 see that's an interesting point, but that's not the point lol
[5:43:32] <velgaduere> this reminds me of the Moblin King from the Oracle games
[5:43:36] <Zeneeba> immortality sucks, but dictatin what a person should do with thier life is worse.
[5:43:39] <+Rafraud> Man scared of death so I guess I will kill them because they are afraid. Actually ass pov lol
[5:43:40] <%kyh9> I'd rather live in pain forever than die
[5:43:44] <tolloponik> how can you miss the point so hard
[5:43:47] <+BigBruthaThunda> the game's message lol
[5:43:48] <+S3xGAZEBO> The real thing, is that no one has the right to choose for you.
[5:43:49] <%Explodincatz> @velgaduere same
[5:43:54] <Make_me_mad> Immortality only sucks if you're a loser who can't have fun with it. Write a book.
[5:43:57] <Awesome_Leaf> say that when youre living in pain
[5:43:58] <T_Sasquatch> @kyh9 forever ?
[5:44:03] <+whimsipop> @kyh9 but the fact of the matter is forever is also impossible, soooooo
[5:44:04] <%kyh9> @T_Sasquatch yep
[5:44:05] <meatling420> @Jiggisnipe oh no i meant that immortality is bad and fearing death is natural
[5:44:07] <+S3xGAZEBO> @zeneeba right?
[5:44:07] <Videogomez> they've lived long enough, i think the universe already ended
[5:44:08] <shinichizio> @Make_me_mad t. zalsalamel
[5:44:08] <+Rafraud> @S3xGAZEBO exactly
[5:44:12] <ignaeon> @Make_me_mad Green's tunnel takes 4 hours to go through, is filled with marks counting the days making it, and it's likely he spent hundreds of years on it, and he talks about it like it was an afternoon. It's implied they've all been living for an uncountable amount of time.
[5:44:17] <%kyh9> @kyh9 I'm just saying if I was given the choice
[5:44:25] <Make_me_mad> @ignaeon Write two books.
[5:44:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> but what if you have other immortals who you love?
[5:44:31] <teefpal> He's been alive for at least a few million years
[5:44:33] <Yomamma1337> @Make_me_mad 1 tally mark is 1 year, it took him millions of years
[5:44:47] <SaiyanShoto> This is how it feels to chew 5 gum
[5:44:49] <ExpressNode> I mean taking his arm is good enough reason to kill him
[5:44:50] <+PMAvers> I was under the impression the marks in Green's tunnel were one per year, not just days.
[5:44:54] <+CrownlessKitty> @Make_me_mad millions and millions
[5:44:58] <meatling420> 3.1 million years is their approximate age. youd either go insane or beg for death by then
[5:45:05] <teefpal> Big BIG Pol Pot energy
[5:45:10] <VincentGraves> what a great message
[5:45:17] <%Giothegame> Will you bear that burden?
[5:45:18] <hakumaribo> yeah they been here for over 3million years, at some point its mercy
[5:45:18] <+Rafraud> good story Kappa
[5:45:29] <Lt_Campbell> kill the cursor
[5:45:30] <BlackermanZX> twist the knife for their own good wooliePOYO
[5:45:33] <tolloponik> your a god of death and everyone's clock has been expired for centuries
[5:45:37] <%Prevot> SourPls
[5:45:38] <SaiyanShoto> This sounds like that one persona 5 song
[5:45:41] <Champstice> Wooooooooooooooooosh
[5:45:41] <TheFramedWarlock> Good thing I didn't listen to the Everhood shills
[5:45:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> get face stomped
[5:45:48] <+CrownlessKitty> they all lost who they were long ago, mages tormenting the others, forgetting everything because nothing matters
[5:45:54] <zedravan> the gum muffles the sound
[5:45:58] <MadBaller123> Is this like the original pig fight or is it spiced up a bit?
[5:46:02] <rasamune> Man his anger at this game's message is gonna detract from his ability to play the game isn't it
[5:46:07] <%emptyantics> Gaslighting isn’t real, ya’ll are just crazy
[5:46:10] <Make_me_mad> Immortality is baller.
[5:46:12] <TheFramedWarlock> I would have been pretty mad to discover that this plot is what everyone's ranting and raving about
[5:46:14] <BlackermanZX> read fire punch if you wanna see miserable immortality
[5:46:15] <Zeneeba> @madballer123 same
[5:46:19] <+CrownlessKitty> don't feel bad, they need a change of pace
[5:46:23] <rasamune> @emptyantics Good one LUL
[5:46:35] <TheFramedWarlock> Fire Punch is great
[5:46:36] <+ghostfaceninja_> a big evil pig who goes invisible... are we sure this guy isn't Ganon?
[5:46:49] <velgaduere> shut up Lady Astraea
[5:46:50] <hassanico2> Why does she show up here?
[5:46:55] <AngryAsian5> Are you ashamed of your words and deeds? LUL
[5:46:58] <xerotwo> Looks like esper terra
[5:47:03] <Daxalog> I am powerless (i say why throwing notes at you)
[5:47:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> NANOMACHINES SON
[5:47:08] <+BigBruthaThunda> cap
[5:47:15] <%Prevot> oh no is he the blob
[5:47:25] <+meteor530> Sneaky sneak]
[5:47:31] <Daxalog> He looks hot. Id probably get a buff from eating him
[5:47:31] <shinichizio> Ooh that's a rude'n
[5:47:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @meatling420 Yea I agree with that. Immortality is bad cuz of losing loved ones. I think that's the point it's making that fearing death of others is bad but it makes sound like they are fearing their own deaths even though they are immortal.
[5:48:10] <%robosqueeb> his jo crystals
[5:48:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:48:21] <velgaduere> doing real good damage this time
[5:48:24] <+S3xGAZEBO> society is kind of based around the concept that no one should be judge, jury, and executioner...
[5:48:40] <+Rafraud> I mean "mercy killing" without the conscious totally alive party not consenting to said mercy kill is pretty ass
[5:48:40] <Make_me_mad> @S3xGAZEBO But then you have punisher fans.
[5:48:53] <T_Sasquatch> @S3xGAZEBO ? but we have courts
[5:49:03] <Nawji> I dont think the message of the game is bad but the way its presented is pretty poor
[5:49:11] <+Rafraud> Definitely
[5:49:24] <%kyh9> Damn right you're powerless
[5:49:33] <%kyh9> You see these combos
[5:49:42] <nyacoo> Awww
[5:49:46] <0rnan> The music is dope, gameplay is great, the feel bad bait is pretty weak.
[5:49:48] <+Rafraud> "But they want to die" he says as person in question is currently fighting to not die
[5:49:49] <+meteor530> That part is pretty rough
[5:49:51] <+CrownlessKitty> this story takes place in a universe we know little about, in a timeline so long we can't really comprehend, so there's a lot of nuance lost if you take it at face value of "i can kill whoever i want"
[5:49:51] <Videogomez> that double kick
[5:49:54] <BlackermanZX> thats fucked
[5:50:03] <+meteor530> Insta fucked
[5:50:05] <velgaduere> JUICE++
[5:50:26] <rasamune> @CrownlessKitty Thank you
[5:50:26] <velgaduere> I appreciate that this song is basically trying to be rock operatic
[5:50:31] <@Menitta> but where does the nuance even come from
[5:50:36] <HR_Freud> no it's fine they're all going to heaven
[5:50:38] <@Menitta> if we don't see any of it
[5:50:45] <meatling420> for being a game about murdering all these people its weirdly uplifting, like death sounds scary and awful but its a nice rest everything gets
[5:50:56] <+BigBruthaThunda> yeah they could have done better to show the misery
[5:51:01] <T_Sasquatch> "rest"
[5:51:12] <+Rafraud> "It's just long sleep"
[5:51:24] <+CrownlessKitty> @Menitta the game is not over
[5:51:26] <+BigBruthaThunda> a lot of what it shows is fun time with friends
[5:51:39] <+meteor530> It's very nice the game lets yo regen health. This would rough as fuck if you had one shot and few mistakes given
[5:51:39] <@Menitta> fair
[5:51:41] <@Menitta> lol
[5:51:48] <Nawji> bringing atheist mindset into fictional settings is pretty cringe
[5:51:48] <meatling420> oh im sorry i thought the point of killing immortals was they DONT want an afterlife
[5:51:55] <Make_me_mad> It's hard to justify murdering a bunch of people because they've lived too long when you all got together and played DND a few hours ago and had a good time.
[5:52:01] <TheFramedWarlock> @bigbruthathunda Yeah because it wants to be Undertale but flips the routes so it kinda shoots itself in the face
[5:52:07] <Daxalog> I swear I heard the opening riff of this song on Frets on Fire
[5:52:08] <TheFramedWarlock> As far as we've seen
[5:52:08] <+CrownlessKitty> @Nawji lmao
[5:52:11] <T_Sasquatch> for all we know we die and just go to another planet for new game plus LLUL
[5:52:17] <+BigBruthaThunda> @theframedwarlock  100%
[5:52:18] <MadBaller123> Who hasn't gotten angry at their DnD group at least one time?
[5:52:22] <Champstice> It's just chemicals man, don't worry about it
[5:52:25] <HR_Freud> undertale + the good place + dmt
[5:52:31] <+Rafraud> Unless a character straight up says kill me dude I'm done living its aight
[5:52:33] <+Rafraud> Then like
[5:52:35] <+Rafraud> ????
[5:52:37] <Make_me_mad> @MadBaller123 This is taking a TPK a little far.
[5:52:45] <+ghostfaceninja_> @T_Sasquatch some sects of Mormons actually believe this
[5:52:52] <+meteor530> @MadBaller123 I did when they lied to me that it was a fun thing to spend time on.
[5:52:53] <@Menitta> "no you cannot put your armor on before this ambush fight in dark heresy"
[5:53:03] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[5:53:14] <+Jiggisnipe> this is a jam tho
[5:53:45] <+BigBruthaThunda> it wraps up better later, but yeah...

[5:55:48] <rasamune> I will say I think this game could have done a much better job of saying what it wants to say, but there's a lot of assumption of bad faith in the game's writing that I don't think is fair

[5:57:07] <+CrownlessKitty> @rasamune yeah, like this stuff is all after the "pacifist" route, which is only shorter cause in a world of immortals, you can just leave and let them live, everything after is you choosing not to do that
[5:57:15] <+Jiggisnipe> he's so salty
[5:57:25] <Uncle_Christian> Salted Pork
[5:57:30] <magnumlockjaw> @Jiggisnipe Not as salty as Woolie

[6:54:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> I hope this game ends like Inscryption
[6:54:44] <+Rafraud> Tatakae
[6:54:46] <TheFramedWarlock> It's fitting that all the save points are gaslights
[6:54:47] <%Prevot> here I go killing again
[6:54:47] <teefpal> This looks familiar
[6:54:52] <+vexion_smh> God I missed the silent protag
[6:54:54] <Mr_Rakjo> Here i go killing again LUL
[6:54:54] <velgaduere> this is as good of a twist as Deadly Premonition had
[6:54:57] <%LastHazzerd> the run animation is silly LUL
[6:54:57] <CoffeeCobra> some of yall have never played One Shot and it shows LUL
[6:54:59] <+Rafraud> @Ricky_Rexx I hope this game ends
[6:55:00] <ligerglare> very trippy
[6:55:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so lemme make sure i understood, at the start of the game, were we red or pink controlling red?
[6:55:09] <AppleBerryKitty> are we lost again <.>
[6:55:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Bro chat has TURNED on this game
[6:55:16] <meatling420> ill concede is the ending is a little long. but becoming so bored that ppl fight and literally torture each other for fun is a pretty big con
[6:55:16] <sud4ii> @CoffeeCobra At least One Shot wasn't up its own ass
[6:55:16] <+PkSilent01> @cobalt_phoenix_ yes?
[6:55:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> I have too but just saying
[6:55:23] <velgaduere> @Ricky_Rexx shouldn't have botched it in the end LUL
[6:55:25] <Daxalog> The game is cool. Pink can bite cement.
[6:55:27] <Zeneeba> @ricky_rexx  yup.
[6:55:33] <+Ravenian96> pink DO be double cheeked up tho
[6:55:35] <TheFramedWarlock> We were controlling Red, because Pink thought they were too weak to control Red ?
[6:55:36] <%LastHazzerd> @Ricky_Rexx chat fallows the general mood of the streamer
[6:55:39] <+Rafraud> Should have simply been a better game
[6:55:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ravenian96 morally grey
[6:55:45] <magnumlockjaw> I don't know how I forgot how anti-Woolie and anti-Woolie's Chat this game would be at the end
[6:55:46] <velgaduere> if you can't stick the landing when you're writing it, throw it out and start anew
[6:55:49] <Furtive_Vulpine> the end of a game can make or BREAK a game in half
[6:55:52] <+Rafraud> Let me say gameplay wise this is solid, but HOLY FUCK
[6:55:55] <teefpal> @CoffeeCobra Oneshot had a likeable protagonist and characters
[6:55:55] <+Ricky_Rexx> Into the void
[6:55:57] <TheFramedWarlock> But Pink was actually using Red as a scapegoat because they wanted to murder
[6:56:01] <EL_TRO> Red was an excuse Pink use to cope for killing?
[6:56:02] <+Ricky_Rexx> dwown
[6:56:05] <TheFramedWarlock> Or something ?
[6:56:05] <ordnavi> game was so cool before this new character
[6:56:07] <rasamune> @Ricky_Rexx I like this game and respect what it was trying to do, but the story really needed like three or four more passes. And a lot of editing around the 90% mark
[6:56:10] <%LastHazzerd> @magnumlockjaw RIP
[6:56:13] <+Rafraud> SMELLS LIKE DARKNESS

[6:57:32] <%oneimportantthing> Lmao everyone hates this game now
[6:57:33] <+Sirtoastman> it might have been better to have just silently ended after the sun fight
[6:57:33] <count_bob> Pink is immortal too
[6:57:39] <+Ravenian96> YEAH YOU'RE A SADIST WOOLIE
[6:57:40] <%Deasmeister> """Save""
[6:57:48] <+Fetrigon> woolie...
[6:57:48] <TheFramedWarlock> It would have been way better to end after the Sun fight
[6:57:50] <Mr_Rakjo> WOOLIE THE SADIST LUL
[6:57:51] <jimgimp> The game has simply gone overboard with the meta twists that most people will now be disengaged by the story, even if its played for laughs to some degree
[6:57:52] <+Rafraud> I'm gonna yell
[6:57:52] <ExpressNode> Wow I didn't think the ending would be this fucked up
[6:57:55] <0rnan> Remember, it's sadistic to let people live in this game.
[6:57:55] <+Rafraud> LET IT HAPPEN
[6:57:57] <Samori79> LUL this ending
[6:57:59] <BreakfastSampler> actually getting emotionally manipulated by a Fight Beatmania game LUL
[6:58:04] <Zeneeba> @oneimportantthing i don't. still love it and its music. the endin is just weak.
[6:58:08] <velgaduere> shut up Pink
[6:58:10] <+Fetrigon> yeah I guess the got woolie pegged LUL
[6:58:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good.
[6:58:12] <jimgimp> It's every Rick and Morty episode essentially
[6:58:14] <velgaduere> please just die already
[6:58:14] <+DotRook> I didn't like that at the end, the game didn't feel like it had the guts to follow through
[6:58:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> You tried to let it happen, the game said no, then said you HAVE to let it happen wtf?
[6:58:20] <fatsausagedoggo> good
[6:58:20] <SuperGoblinPunch> Good
[6:58:23] <+vexion_smh> good
[6:58:23] <conchthechimera> Tame Impala starts playing in the background
[6:58:25] <trench2nowhere> "Saved"
[6:58:27] <+Ravenian96> Is this game about murder suicide?
[6:58:27] <+Rafraud> good
[6:58:28] <velgaduere> good
[6:58:29] <jockymongy> Good.
[6:58:29] <nonexistentPumpkin> not resisting makes you miss some lore-oop too late
[6:58:31] <Furtive_Vulpine> and scene

[6:59:49] <lonosis47> The game became  bad a long time ago idk why people are just now complaining
[6:59:49] <yukichocomilk> MALDING
[6:59:49] <EL_TRO> this song is so good
[6:59:52] <%arkv01> no more words just BEATZ
[6:59:52] <Zeneeba> "Euthenasia Rollercoaster" ...for anyone curious...the song name.
[6:59:52] <+Fetrigon> s'all good LUL majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko
[6:59:53] <tolloponik> @Ravenian96 no its about accepting the inevitability of death but Woolie keeps trying to put his on moralities on the concept and getting angry because of it
[6:59:57] <Afrosamasenpai> HE SCHMOOVIN
[6:59:59] <%livlinn> "The gameplay" roryvaDerp
[7:00:00] <+Fetrigon> stalalaPadoru stalalaPadoru stalalaPadoru stalalaPadoru stalalaPadoru
[7:00:05] <a_mad_dragon_> whoa that one stank leg frame
[7:00:08] <Samori79> "gameplay" what about  the rest.
[7:00:09] <CoffeeCobra> this is just the CBT ending and none of you are strong enough for it LUL
[7:00:11] <GoblinPinkWizard> I can’t tell if he’s being sarcastic
[7:00:12] <+BigBruthaThunda> very specific wording LUL
[7:00:15] <meatling420> "every story has to be about teaching me a moral" brainrot
[7:00:16] <puluxor> majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank majinoDrank
[7:00:19] <%livlinn> joofbBop joofbBop joofbBop joofbBop joofbBop
[7:00:20] <Mr_Rakjo> @tolloponik yup but he decided thats his take so it is what it is
[7:00:28] <velgaduere> @CoffeeCobra so you like CBT eh doodSmug
[7:00:31] <+Rafraud> @tolloponik Idk man I saw a game that justified killing people who didn't want to die and then blamed you for it and asked you if you felt bad
[7:00:31] <+vexion_smh> AWW
[7:00:31] <%Explodincatz> @lonosis47 the idea is that an ending can save the writing
[7:00:35] <TheFramedWarlock> @tolloponik Not like the game forces you to do something you really don't want to and the entire theme makes absolutely no sense unless the rules that the writers made up apply
[7:00:39] <$ArCielArDor> everyone who is hating just want to have something to hate.
[7:00:42] <HotSauceFiend> you killed everyone. Now kill your employer
[7:00:42] <ligerglare> woolieYIKES
[7:00:43] <tolloponik> its a stupid take but I can't control people
[7:00:43] <CoffeeCobra> @velgaduere I don't even have a dick and balls so jokes on you
[7:00:45] <verscoll> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[7:00:49] <%atlasdotwav> Gotta emphasize the good parts!
[7:00:50] <+Jiggisnipe> @tolloponik Woolie's whole point was he wasn't gonna make the decision for them. If they want to live, it's not his place to kill them
[7:00:59] <nakunattakage> majinoNeko limesDance majinoDrank limesDance majinoNeko
[7:00:59] <magnumlockjaw> I enjoy this game
[7:01:07] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> nzeroDon majinoDrank nzeroDon majinoDrank nzeroDon majinoDrank
[7:01:08] <rasamune> The game tells you over and over again that destroying the Everhood is a good thing; this is not "feel like a hero yet"
[7:01:09] <trench2nowhere> These edibles are strong
[7:01:10] <0rnan> Now back to the good part
[7:01:10] <velgaduere> @CoffeeCobra so does that mean you're strong enough to survive it? 🤔
[7:01:11] <%redcoatna> majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko
[7:01:17] <+Rafraud> Can't believe we have to explain to chat that you should not kill people lol
[7:01:18] <count_bob> I love this game.
[7:01:31] <kingra> @rasamune But it does not explain WHY it is a good thing
[7:01:35] <Fisto420> limmyEcciedLGif limmyEcciedMGif limmyEcciedRGif
[7:01:39] <tolloponik> I'll hold off until I really know WHO pink is
[7:01:41] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpDance nzeroDon
[7:01:44] <meatling420> he doesnt feel like a hero bc he keeps dying before everyone thanks him LUL
[7:01:46] <+AngelFlashNishikino> i dont normally watch this live but is ds2/bloodborne happening anytime soon? just finished the final ds1 reggarth episode
[7:01:50] <%Prevot> Back when they played Spec Ops there were a lot of "do you feel like a hero" apologists, I wonder if chat's changed and that's why people turned against this game
[7:01:53] <puluxor> Was JUST thinking
[7:02:04] <rasamune> @rasamune It does, but it's easy to miss. That's definitely a fault of the game's writing, I won't deny that
[7:02:07] <%livlinn> succinRoll succinRoll succinRoll succinRoll succinRoll succinRoll
[7:02:07] <CoffeeCobra> @velgaduere yes actually because if you were you'd play it and get the top tier ending
[7:02:09] <Zeneeba> i still fuckin love this game and its Ost. never gonna change.
[7:02:09] <velgaduere> yeah this is like specifically LSDJ Anamana vibes
[7:02:17] <ligerglare> woolieEVIL woolieYIKES woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieYIKES
[7:02:19] <+vexion_smh> Is this the hopes and dreams equivalent of this game?
[7:02:25] <+JustToWatch> that anamanguci cover of hopes and dreams fucking ruled
[7:02:30] <%Animatic_> Animatic_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! chiptune acid trip is good
[7:02:35] <+projectmanatees> Gotta free people from being stuck in the infinite loop
[7:02:44] <+Rafraud> Like this videogame is sick, but this story is actually dogshit (Or this ending I guess)
[7:02:45] <CoffeeCobra> seriously tho what is it with these past couple years and people getting piss mad as soon as a game has a flaw like, yall are just mean LUL
[7:02:52] <%atlasdotwav> This DnB style thing is hot
[7:02:55] <puluxor> I can't stop staring at that crack
[7:02:56] <%Animatic_> the fact hopes and dreams was inspired by anamanaguchi makes that cover even better.
[7:02:57] <Pt_Kamen> weight of the world or something
[7:03:02] <+the22cstomp> @CoffeeCobra moral superiority or something
[7:03:06] <Furtive_Vulpine> shit, i forgot anamanaguchi covered hopes and dreams, i need to listen to that cirNeuron
[7:03:06] <+CrownlessKitty> @CoffeeCobra the salt is real
[7:03:09] <count_bob> @prevot I enjoyed this game a lot more then spec ops
[7:03:13] <TheFramedWarlock> @rasamune It tells you over and over that it's a good thing with literally no proof whatsoever so far, and tries to make you feel bad every step of the way
[7:03:27] <CoffeeCobra> @CrownlessKitty It is and for good reason
[7:03:31] <lonosis47> No one is mad we just dont like the game
[7:03:33] <HR_Freud> god was a cube all along
[7:03:34] <BreakfastSampler> @TheFramedWarlock I maintain that 'feel bad' part is put on entirely by the player
[7:03:34] <+Rafraud> @CoffeeCobra "Man I sure am enjoying this meal" "Wait why are you shitting in it" "Well its still a meal, aren't you still enjoying it? "No"
[7:03:44] <mrtanaka111> what a controversial LP
[7:03:45] <0rnan> Listen to this credits song
[7:03:52] <Fisto420> mastergirKroolDance mastergirKroolDance mastergirKroolDance mastergirKroolDance
[7:03:56] <%LastHazzerd> I do see how folk would compare this to spec ops the line thing, i just don't get that vibe or message from the game
[7:04:00] <nakunattakage> majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko
[7:04:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CoffeeCobra it's not just a flaw, in this case it's the game trying to shame you for doing the thing the game just told you to do
[7:04:09] <%arkv01> thats kinda bullshit PunOko
[7:04:10] <meatling420> @TheFramedWarlock that was the entire point of the forest spirit, it explains that this good for everyone
[7:04:12] <velgaduere> listen I'm back to enjoying this game until this fight ends okay
[7:04:14] <@Menitta> I know I'm the wrong person to ask because I don't even like Undertale that much lol
[7:04:16] <coziestbank> chat just shut ul
[7:04:17] <velgaduere> I'll resume bitching after don't worry
[7:04:20] <hassanico2> WHat, the game has been nothing but encouraging
[7:04:24] <teefpal> If it had shown they were all trapped in a simulation or something, I'd understand
[7:04:30] <wendigo172> I come back to chat fighting Sadge
[7:04:35] <jimgimp> Everything ever created ever is just a copy of everything else even if it gets mades thousands of times over by different generations of people
[7:04:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> 10 hour stream lets goooooooooooooo
[7:04:35] <Yomamma1337> still got 3 superbosses after this anyways
[7:04:37] <%Prevot> oh boy
[7:04:41] <jimgimp> Let it go
[7:04:53] <+HyraxW> it does tell you that they are all stuck there
[7:04:54] <+Rygaklu> chat seems like they have a literal reading of the game. the end to me was more spiritual
[7:04:57] <Clyderso> yeah its good to pause here
[7:04:59] <jimgimp> Engage or Disengage
[7:04:59] <mrtanaka111> @jimgimp proof or false
[7:05:04] <+Ravenian96> I like the ost and art, dislike the story overall simple as
[7:05:07] <CoffeeCobra> @Rygaklu this guy gets it LUL
[7:05:07] <magnumlockjaw> Regardless of how any of you feel, remember we get to fight the devs later
[7:05:08] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Characters in game not liking that you're killing them isn't a 'Feel like a hero' moment, this really isn't that confusing
[7:05:08] <%Explodincatz> words man
[7:05:11] <TheFramedWarlock> Does the message make any sense if this world has no afterlife ?
[7:05:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> save with a capital K
[7:05:14] <HotSauceFiend> people are having trouble grasping euthenasia as a solution
[7:05:18] <+Rafraud> I don't even think this story is like undertale, its just a bad own thing
[7:05:20] <jimgimp> @mrtanaka111 You don't need proof for that one lol
[7:05:22] <DarknessHS> the other saving LUL
[7:05:24] <+Jiggisnipe> oh shit
[7:05:24] <BlackermanZX> this fight is gonna take some time
[7:05:27] <+Rafraud> OH WEEELLLLLLL
[7:05:29] <nonexistentPumpkin> @teefpal or like, shown flowers growing after you killed an immortal and skipped the "kill the dimension" part
[7:05:30] <rasamune> @teefpal They essentially are. The Everhood is an artificial realm created by power-mad wizards as a means to escape death. Again, easily missable, and it's a big fault of the game that it's not made more clear
[7:05:31] <+Jiggisnipe> it's 8:20 LUL
[7:05:32] <tolloponik> @Rygaklu finally another voice of reason
[7:05:42] <%LastHazzerd> Reggie gotta get home before curfew right?
[7:05:44] <nakunattakage> majinoNeko together the great philosophers in the chatroom will solve all the riddles and concerns presented by this game majinoNeko
[7:05:45] <nyacoo> There is no afterlife, the game is very buddhistic
[7:05:49] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Noooo Don't stop here
[7:05:55] <HotSauceFiend> but really these people used to humans. Like regular people. over countles aeons devolved into these creatures with no prupose
[7:06:01] <mrtanaka111> i think the game is taoistic-hermetical
[7:06:04] <%LastHazzerd> @TheOlMitcheroo they don't have a choice
[7:06:08] <tolloponik> chat DEATH is something that you never have a choice over
[7:06:09] <velgaduere> most of chat mad at game, the rest of chat mad at most of chat for being mad at game
[7:06:13] <Videogomez> died to god LUL
[7:06:20] <BlackermanZX> good thing you can stab frog again wooliePOYO
[7:06:24] <nonexistentPumpkin> @teefpal there's also some lore that should be more clearly communicated instead of being hidden behind resisting in the void
[7:06:26] <+MetalPanic> yo but the music is pretty good though

[7:09:54] <Yomamma1337> in the main menu you can choose your fights
[7:09:56] <%Explodincatz> moral of the story: gaslit

[7:12:00] <+PMAvers> I mean, look at how many Dark Souls games have come out with poor writing. They havn't gotten it good in three attempts.
[7:12:16] <Videogomez> it's a game literally made by 2 dudes

[7:13:01] <Dopamien> @HyraxW thats a spicy one ( I have no opinion btw )
[7:13:06] <GoblinPinkWizard> This game was indeed made by 2 guys, but that doesn’t make it above criticism
[7:13:08] <teefpal> @HyraxW TLOU2 was good though
[7:13:14] <GoblinPinkWizard> Good game but yknow
[7:13:15] <+TheDandyGuy> you dont have to be so opaque lol
[7:13:20] <%arkv01> it's not just you woolie, writing gets people killed ScaredyCat

[7:13:22] <%LastHazzerd> it's a very valid take
[7:13:23] <slipdog> TLOU2? good?
