[0:01:47] <%TubeMan642> Hey @woolieversus you ready for Assassin's Creed Infinite?
[0:01:53] <CappuccinoGuil> 4-frame lag applied to you just means your HEC stat is 0 LUL
[0:01:57] <%krispen_wa> Is Guilty Gear HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[0:02:10] <kikoeru_san> Oh 5 frames is a big deal with DOLPHINS
[0:02:11] <andre11dr> Again it's like 4 or 5 frames, as opposed to SF5 wich has like 8 frames of delay
[0:02:19] <%dds333a> Then, it'll affect you
[0:02:51] <CappuccinoGuil> I live in Brazil, any online game I play I play with lag. I'm always used to frame delay LUL

[0:06:42] <%Lion_kun> My PS5 froze once in 2 months.
[0:06:44] <%dds333a> Hey, you might dodge the worst of a launch LUL
[0:06:47] <Tracazoid> My old PC crapped out right before Dark Souls 3's launch, it sucks but the FOMO won't kill you
[0:06:48] <Deasmeister> Mine went into rest mode by itself until I turned off hdmi link

[0:09:40] <%dormoxx__> there are projects that replace the gd-rom drive with a sd card reader in dreamcasts!
[0:10:03] <%dds333a> I mean, it's just the DC
[0:10:17] <andre11dr> I think i lost like 4 360s
[0:10:20] <lc_cl7> Ads WutFace
[0:10:22] <LadyAmatsu> I got a GameCube that stopped reading disks I could never replace the lens for. Not my skillset
[0:10:22] <laserbeaming> what's the state of DC emulation?
[0:10:27] <Equirah> that's why emulation is so impportant
[0:10:28] <lc_cl7> rip canadians
[0:10:41] <%dds333a> @laserbeaming better than the Saturn LUL
[0:10:53] <+The_Death_Owl> nulldc bear is the go to

[0:11:04] <iacus_> good to hear
[0:11:42] <+FuqBoiSlim> N64?
[0:11:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> CappuccinoGuil subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Damn, sub didn't renew, should be fixed. Now that I have a job that pays me, I can subscribe without worries. Wild feeling. Keep doing what you do, fellas! I had a question: have you played Dusk in the past? If not, I'd recommend it, made by New Blood.
[0:11:46] <iacus_> The HyperNeoGeo 64 lol
[0:11:57] <Prevot> n64 has Always been fucky
[0:12:10] <LadyAmatsu> Some 3DS games have trouble running smoothly, like MonsterHunter4U
[0:12:16] <glass_marcus> Never been able to emulate a saturn game without it messing up
[0:12:16] <+The_Death_Owl> pimp my DC
[0:12:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[0:12:44] <andre11dr> Dusk is sick
[0:12:53] <andre11dr> No
[0:12:55] <guiltyboya> wat
[0:12:57] <laserbeaming> that's RUST
[0:12:58] <@Solidus_113> Rust?
[0:13:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> That's RUST
[0:13:04] <+FuqBoiSlim> LMAAOOO
[0:13:05] <superchunk121> That's rust
[0:13:06] <%Irridium> Think you're thinking of Rust
[0:13:06] <%dds333a> Rust, Woolie
[0:13:08] <@Solidus_113> that's rust
[0:13:08] <guiltyboya> No no no, Dusk is that retro looking fps
[0:13:10] <iacus_> isn't Dusk the retro FPS?
[0:13:11] <andre11dr> No that's Rust
[0:13:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dusk is a Boomer shooter
[0:13:17] <%Irridium> LUL
[0:13:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dusk is Doom + Quake.
[0:13:20] <%dds333a> The Dusk devs dunked on Pat
[0:13:22] <Bonebagmel> Rust is a BR survival game
[0:13:27] <@Solidus_113> Dusk is a new-era boomer shooter
[0:13:27] <%dds333a> Right?
[0:13:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat played Dusk.
[0:13:28] <+Mendin> Oh I thought they were talking about Dust: An Elysian Tail - aka Furry DMC
[0:13:31] <andre11dr> Dusk is the Quake one
[0:13:33] <iacus_> @dds333a Liking the game already...
[0:13:34] <Hammatime8> Rust, Dusk, Ducks, same thing Kappa
[0:13:41] <%holydeviant1> @Mendin Everyone is confused!
[0:13:48] <+The_Death_Owl> Furry DMC thesph1MistyJoy
[0:13:54] <%dds333a> Not to be confused with Rage Kappa
[0:14:01] <%holydeviant1> (I wouldn't say furry DMC, it's a bit too easy for that)
[0:14:03] <primaryfire> dusk is fuckin tight
[0:14:10] <+Mendin> It's a 2d game but the combo system is big stylish
[0:14:12] <+VictorVonLouche> Like plenty of people didn't like sea of thieves method but at least you can reroll
[0:14:16] <guiltyboya> lmao
[0:14:17] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! speaking of Dusk, it as well as Ultrakill and all of the Dread X collections are on sale
[0:14:19] <@Solidus_113> There was a dusk video on the old channel 4 years ago
[0:14:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> Rust in the past was really cool, not quite big on the new version, too much focus on PvP
[0:14:27] <%Irridium> not only that it also set your dick size
[0:14:36] <andre11dr> Was rust the one with the scanned dick size?
[0:14:36] <%kyh9> Wait,w hat happened?
[0:14:38] <+Mendin> I remember just air juggling enemies higher and higher to spacejump to parts of the map I shouldn't have gone to
[0:14:39] <%dds333a> Sure was
[0:14:40] <%kyh9> What is woolie talking about?
[0:14:41] <+illusiveSaint> rust in general has a lot of gamer moments Kappa
[0:14:46] <primaryfire> oh yeah your sex is based on your steamID I think
[0:14:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:14:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> YEAH, IMAGINE THAT woolieKICKDAD
[0:14:52] <Bonebagmel> Is linked to your steam ID
[0:14:52] <%kyh9> Oh, Rust's auto-character-creator
[0:14:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's tied to your steam ID
[0:14:55] <+The_Death_Owl> doesn't Conan exile have dick customization?
[0:14:56] <Hammatime8> We can't forget the RNG shween size!
[0:14:56] <@Solidus_113> Steam ID
[0:15:15] <Bonebagmel> Tough luck bubba
[0:15:18] <%dds333a> Welp
[0:15:22] <+VictorVonLouche> easy refund at least
[0:15:22] <%kyh9> You're stuck with it
[0:15:24] <+TwitchZoomer2021> That's like real life
[0:15:24] <%holydeviant1> I love it
[0:15:30] <Jeklesworth> Entire tribes based around whos donger was the most mighty
[0:15:31] <%dds333a> I never minded it, but plenty didn't
[0:15:37] <guiltyboya> I mean, it's just like real life!
[0:15:37] <+FuqBoiSlim> very raw
[0:15:44] <andre11dr> I want to be a black woman, for a day
[0:15:46] <%dds333a> It's not even that fun as is LUL
[0:15:50] <%kyh9> Or complain until the devs change it
[0:15:57] <+TwitchZoomer2021> We don't choose who we're born as.
[0:16:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> I just played a game where a virgin wizard summons you into a 90s Arena Shooter - Isekai style - and you're a Mexican salaryman stuck in a big-titty goth girl body. It's WERID.
[0:16:06] <foxname96> @woolieversus it decided dick sizes
[0:16:08] <iacus_> I never understood getting upset about pregenerated cahracters in games
[0:16:09] <%krispen_wa> but i wanna be a cute anime girl
[0:16:34] <+The_Death_Owl> there is half a lesson. the status of your character doesn't have any real implications inside the game
[0:16:39] <iacus_> do dick sizes affect game mechanich?
[0:16:41] <%Necnill> I play games for escapism, Woolie! xD
[0:16:41] <+Herbpudding> Yes
[0:16:46] <primaryfire> hope I don't get an outie belly button
[0:16:48] <%Jeklesworth> Jeklesworth subscribed with Prime. 
[0:16:58] <+dkthefriend> everyone trans and/or non-white laughs understandingly
[0:17:18] <%kyh9> "HE HAS RED HAIR, I HAVE BROWN HAIR, NOOOOOO"
[0:17:22] <andre11dr> Can i get a tight vagina ,i don't want no flaps down there!
[0:17:31] <+Vigonept> fuckimg shaved head soldier man is average gamer? they wish
[0:17:35] <%eanscrale> Honestly it's better than everyone being baldan spess mahreen clone number 9587439
[0:17:35] <Hammatime8> Like how weirdos still complain about having to play as women?
[0:17:44] <%dds333a> How am I supposed to enjoy this character if they're not like me CarlSmile
[0:17:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Gamers™ will complain about a full POC cast because they "don't feel represented" and everyone else just LAUGHS LUL
[0:17:51] <+The_Death_Owl> A Woman? in a video game nicole92UH
[0:18:08] <foxname96> @hammatime8 badly written ones for me
[0:18:22] <mr_sups> "Why'd they have to make the character *POLITICAL*"
[0:18:24] <iacus_> just put whoever you want in your game
[0:18:27] <+VictorVonLouche> there is no aha moment.
[0:18:29] <LadyAmatsu> Like wow, welcome to the experience of a lot of other people have to deal with *all the time*
[0:18:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> The shaved head soldier man is more to do with it being lowest common denominator than self insertion fuel
[0:18:32] <andre11dr> I looked like Nathan drake and i found that type of main caracter design SO BORING
[0:18:39] <Arancet> woolie as nathan drake would make the games infinitely more entertaining
[0:18:40] <%Irridium> some people get so close and yet... :(
[0:18:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> Gamers, say that again BUT SLOWLY
[0:18:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> TRY TO HEAR YOURSELF
[0:18:48] <ataxia72> lmao
[0:19:16] <%dds333a> oh? woolieYE
[0:19:22] <Prevot> reminds me of that Greek Assassin Creed game, where the female protag was canon and the face of the game's remarketing, but player data showed the Male character being massively more used
[0:19:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hakita is so nice and at the same time the most terrifyingly powerful person I've seen.
[0:19:30] <ataxia72> omori is also on sale go play omori everyone
[0:19:31] <iacus_> shallwe
[0:19:32] <LadyAmatsu> Disco Elysium time!
[0:19:36] <%dds333a> Let's
[0:19:44] <andre11dr> Gamers don't want to play as black people...unless it's GTA than they don't seem to care
[0:19:48] <mr_sups> A saw someone say Disco Elysium wasn't Political
[0:19:53] <Esparsenior> Time to finally look inside the church … CHURCH
[0:19:57] <laserbeaming> superg31Harry
[0:19:59] <+The_Death_Owl> great pre stream chat, but I'll dip so I don't get spoiled
[0:20:22] <+illusiveSaint> this game vibe feels so sobering
[0:20:26] <mr_sups> @andre11dr Then its not Political. It's *Urban*
[0:20:31] <kingra> Oh boy we going to CHURCH today?
[0:20:41] <%dds333a> In many ways
[0:20:52] <Prevot> and that's the best GTA of all
[0:20:57] <andre11dr> You mean ME LUL
[0:20:59] <%dds333a> This Carl guy is pretty swell
[0:21:01] <%eanscrale> CJ was the reason I played GTA.
[0:21:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:21:03] <iacus_> I had zero issue playing as CJ...
[0:21:17] <tattleworm> turns out i always wanted to follow the damn train
[0:21:19] <Tracazoid> LUL
[0:21:24] <linSP> when u pick the wrong house
[0:21:27] <Prevot> LUL
[0:21:28] <Hammatime8> LUL
[0:21:33] <+illusiveSaint> LUL
[0:21:43] <%kyh9> Isekai-fans
[0:21:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> CJ was a great character, Los Santos was awesome, San Andreas aged REAL BAD
[0:21:45] <%eanscrale> all the previous protagonists were boring to me, but CJ was cool.
[0:21:46] <%mariothemaio> looooool
[0:21:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:52] <vavilonica> oh you mean psychopaths
[0:21:53] <primaryfire> I don't wanna be black I wanna be default
[0:21:56] <andre11dr> Nah i still love the first Walking Dead ,Lee is great
[0:21:57] <Prevot> San Andrea's made me have a problem with trains
[0:22:00] <iacus_> yeah it's an odd reaction
[0:22:01] <kingra> Don't think it's alot but they do exist
[0:22:04] <%dds333a> And Detective-san here is extremely different from, well, anyone
[0:22:04] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Generic shaved-headed white guy protagonist 360 era
[0:22:05] <%kyh9> Where's my default shepard!
[0:22:11] <%eanscrale> I do wish CJ had better hair options though.
[0:22:17] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I can watch something designed for a different audience, like SPH
[0:22:18] <Fuji808> There were mods for CJs skin tone. Ahem.
[0:22:22] <+VictorVonLouche> empathy for wat though
[0:22:23] <Esparsenior> I don’t look like the Detective, but I still feel for him
[0:22:24] <%eanscrale> BRUH
[0:22:26] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:22:29] <%livlinn> woolieYE woolieYE
[0:22:34] <linSP> Why isn’t the character normal!
[0:22:43] <%mariothemaio> can't believe this character in this fictional world does not look like me, wtf????
[0:22:44] <gfbagel> a very moralist answer
[0:22:50] <iacus_> It would be nice to do a psychological study on that. If it's something that you have to learn or if some people just accept they're playing a different character
[0:22:52] <Prevot> LUL
[0:22:53] <@Solidus_113> and you always make Casca or Darli
[0:22:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> More games should have character creators... BUT ALSO MORE GAMES SHOULDN'T, *WINK*
[0:22:56] <luftraumm1> man the Detective is a cool ass character because he is NOT a hero
[0:22:57] <%MightyDuckShoes> It was all skin. Half the people bitching didn't look like Tommy Verceti or... Chad? Chuck? in 3.
[0:22:58] <ataxia72> growing up my favorite games were Beyond Good and Evil and Metroid Prime so I never felt like I was "losing" anything as the industry has gotten more diverse... I do wonder what sort of games people who just got upset about this kind of thing in the 2010s were playing
[0:22:59] <mr_sups> @gfbagel LUL
[0:23:03] <notadeasterisk> oblivion character creator
[0:23:03] <%kyh9> Go talk to the box
[0:23:05] <%holydeviant1> I didn't understand the "representation" argument until I read Kaiju No 8 and it was about a mid-thirties dude who felt all his life goals were unreachable now
[0:23:09] <+illusiveSaint> Niko bellic was the nice parallel esp with his story lore being a war vet
[0:23:10] <%livlinn> livlinn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Thanks for being here
[0:23:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Solidus_113 I respect a person who knows what they like
[0:23:15] <andre11dr> Did you forget about LIGHT BENDING RICH GUY?
[0:23:18] <%smyld> Gotta love south park’s character creation
[0:23:21] <Miklosher> wasnt a quest, just a choice
[0:23:23] <%Juriasu> you can convince him to give you money yeah
[0:23:25] <Eger007> just talk to him
[0:23:31] <+Vivaciousx3> come back another time
[0:23:32] <laserbeaming> oh, I missed Ultra Rich Light Bending Guy
[0:23:33] <%derap41> You can pause it and roll
[0:23:33] <+Vigonept> the rich love failure
[0:23:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think you need high concept?
[0:24:07] <andre11dr> @woolieversus So did you gave up on the Twitch integration thing?
[0:24:08] <%derap41> yup
[0:24:12] <%insomniacCoder> insomniacCoder subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! any upcoming LP plans? or table top/rpg plans?
[0:24:15] <laserbeaming> Concept, I think
[0:24:17] <Eger007> Concept
[0:24:17] <%Juriasu> conceptualization?
[0:24:19] <%bread_assassin> Concep
[0:24:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> Concept?
[0:24:29] <iacus_> @andre11dr They enabled it for only one session so far
[0:24:33] <LadyAmatsu> Oh wow, I didn't see this guy
[0:24:37] <Eger007> check tem
[0:24:37] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Don't you still have the auto-fail red check thought on?
[0:24:44] <%livlinn> kyoryuBonk
[0:24:48] <ataxia72> I passed that 3% check my first go and made out like a gosh dang bandit
[0:24:52] <andre11dr> @iacus_ I think it was 2
[0:25:03] <luftraumm1> @woolieversus have you noticed you money counter in here?
[0:25:07] <%Lion_kun> Fail it Woolz
[0:25:10] <LadyAmatsu> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx He stopped it temporarily just now
[0:25:21] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Ah thanks, missed it
[0:25:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> Theres almost nothing that gives conceptualization
[0:25:41] <+illusiveSaint> did woolie pass the logic check with Andre in the tent it's also godly
[0:25:44] <andre11dr> I actually don't think i failed this so i don't know what happens
[0:25:49] <%mariothemaio> if you need to pass time just read a book
[0:26:10] <iacus_> ouch
[0:26:15] <+Vivaciousx3> maybe forget art degree?
[0:26:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> HEY, our Art Degree has helped us level up.
[0:26:19] <LadyAmatsu> Art Cop working against you
[0:26:19] <+Vigonept> DO IT
[0:26:22] <Miklosher> reactivate the thought
[0:26:25] <%Lion_kun> Failure is an option woolie
[0:26:29] <KaiserMario> An art degree can't help you make money...
[0:26:31] <laserbeaming> art degree gave us a bunch of levels
[0:26:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Vivaciousx3 it's too good to forget.
[0:26:34] <andre11dr> Yeah the thought just won't let you do it
[0:26:37] <iacus_> Are those checks new in the FC? I don't remember them
[0:26:39] <skyenoz> @vivaciousx3 but art cop is REALLY good
[0:26:41] <luftraumm1> its funny that they're concerned about this specific test
[0:26:54] <+Vigonept> it would delete art degree
[0:26:56] <laserbeaming> you can't get back forgotten thoughts
[0:26:59] <andre11dr> But you have to us s point on it
[0:27:02] <notadeasterisk> you can't get it back
[0:27:02] <%mariothemaio> if you remove a learned thought you can't relearn it
[0:27:03] <%derap41> forgetting means is lost forever
[0:27:06] <Eger007> Can't you intentionally fail?
[0:27:12] <+Vivaciousx3> I think he has enough stocked up medicine to deal with morale damage
[0:27:12] <Fuji808> You cannot get forgotten thoughts back.
[0:27:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, if you forget a thought, but you have already finished it, can you put it back on without having to internalizing it again?
[0:27:30] <Deasmeister> @Eger007 Yep fail a failure
[0:27:32] <andre11dr> He hasn't talked to Cindy hasn't he?
[0:27:33] <+Stormiercashew> drip cop
[0:27:37] <%derap41> Almost got a full drip
[0:27:41] <dukenux> Can you actually roll for him giving you a small loan of million real
[0:27:44] <%Lion_kun> You lose thoughts forever
[0:27:46] <heysamuel> @CappuccinoGuil nope, if you finish a thought and forget it, it's gone forever
[0:27:47] <%bread_assassin> @CappuccinoGuil No forgetting a completed thought makes it gone for good.
[0:27:59] <+Vivaciousx3> cryptobiologists
[0:28:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> @bread_assassin @heysamuel holy SHIT that's rough
[0:28:18] <heysamuel> suuuuuuper rough
[0:28:20] <+Vigonept> you were waiting for the disco lights
[0:28:27] <%bread_assassin> You wanna do it in the evening.
[0:28:28] <andre11dr> Night is when you want to do it
[0:28:29] <%derap41> Woolie you've been in Japan when do people sing Karaoke
[0:28:33] <%Juriasu> whirling is full with people in the evening but they go to bed around 22-23
[0:28:51] <dukenux> you need to find a FALN baseball cap
[0:28:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:28:56] <%holydeviant1> The song is good both ways
[0:29:00] <%DashXero> Dat vast soul.
[0:29:05] <dukenux> (i don't know if there's one, btw)
[0:29:05] <%holydeviant1> THis is one of those cases where you might want to hear both!
[0:29:21] <iacus_> ah the crypto guys
[0:29:22] <%holydeviant1> (Failing and succeeding I mean)
[0:29:23] <foxname96> @woolieversus For the love of god!! Do both Fail and Successful Karaoke. You will love it. <3 <3 <3
[0:29:23] <+Vivaciousx3> they told you the adress at the apartment
[0:29:24] <Miklosher> You need to talk to the working class woman
[0:30:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> I can't even tell what that picture is
[0:30:26] <%shoutofthehobo> @woolieversus Since we never get to see them, what kind of shoes do you and Reggie rock?
[0:30:29] <linSP> Every time it makes me laugh
[0:30:31] <andre11dr> You need to do this without Kim
[0:30:31] <dukenux> There needs to be a mod, that allows to hotkey uniform sets
[0:30:35] <%derap41> Kim is into it
[0:30:49] <Reveresao> It's worth it to reload to see the success and failed karaoke situations
[0:30:50] <+illusiveSaint> you're a woolie it's your job to be a jerk
[0:30:52] <available_line> there goes gravity
[0:31:01] <servicesuspension> You don't need politeness. Copman
[0:31:07] <+illusiveSaint> your a cop i mean LUL
[0:31:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> A polite cop? No such thing
[0:31:19] <+Gloom_Tangerine> @woolieversus just a reminder, you’re missing out on dialogue by not having the crazy tie equipped.
[0:31:20] <+Stormiercashew> no time for politeness, only time for hustle
[0:31:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Gloom_Tangerine seems he doesn't have a high enough inland stat
[0:31:44] <%derap41> Her portrait is great
[0:32:09] <%X2Eliah> @Gloom_Tangerine no he isnt, pls stop spreading fud
[0:32:35] <servicesuspension> 50 years ago, they had movies already
[0:32:51] <%DashXero> He's like Elvis.

[0:36:18] <Dreary_Sun> I never saw that line
[0:36:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Of course you don't, Harry, you're European.
[0:36:35] <dukenux> WOW
[0:36:49] <%Lion_kun> SHUT UP ENCYCLOPAEDIA
[0:36:50] <dukenux> That's impressive

[0:37:03] <Chatterbox1991> Mexigolia?
[0:37:10] <ProducerMatt42> Was there a stream between the 25th and now?
[0:37:13] <Esparsenior> I like this conversation
[0:37:18] <Esparsenior> Short and sweet
[0:37:19] <%X2Eliah> @ProducerMatt42 no
[0:37:22] <kingra> LUL
[0:37:27] <servicesuspension> man, what a dick
[0:37:34] <dukenux> what's the difference between a boiadero and gaucho
[0:37:39] <robert_orri> SIGMA MALE
[0:37:43] <Dreary_Sun> but the encyclopedia is interesting, and it's one of the few voices that is actually helpful
[0:37:47] <%hax_metatron> BEGONETHOTADEIRO
[0:37:52] <Prevot> SIGMADEIRO
[0:37:52] <%X2Eliah> Sigma boiadero
[0:38:21] <ProducerMatt42> @x2eliah ok good, the VODs are gone I think
[0:38:26] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dukenux boiaderos have pale poisoning lol
[0:38:37] <%holydeviant1> Kim hates the Pale and thinking about it
[0:38:57] <laserbeaming> It was mentioned by Joyce I think, but The Western Plain is a name for the Pale
[0:38:58] <%hax_metatron> shiversync
[0:38:58] <%MightyDuckShoes> BoiaMale>SigmaMale>AlphaMale

[0:39:43] <kingra> This VA is SO good
[0:39:48] <laserbeaming> I assume Irmao means brother?
[0:39:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> She's high Shivers, high Electrochem I'd say
[0:39:53] <Dreary_Sun> your shivers are nutty, yeah
[0:39:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> @laserbeaming it does
[0:39:56] <%Gruhunchously> This VA is amazing
[0:39:57] <luftraumm1> I absolutely LOVE her accent
[0:39:58] <dukenux> "You know, i'm something of a Pale Burnout myself"
[0:40:22] <dukenux> this makes me wonder
[0:40:24] <%derap41> Don't let it set in
[0:40:27] <%krispen_wa> he cares for you
[0:40:30] <%X2Eliah> Kim is such a stick-arse
[0:40:31] <dukenux> does Pale enhance your Shivers
[0:40:34] <%hax_metatron> Imagine waking up and talking about Global Warming with EVERYONE YOU SEE?
[0:40:37] <%Gruhunchously> He's trying not to let it set in
[0:40:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think he is also slightly afraid of the Pale?
[0:40:53] <%X2Eliah> @hax_metatron isn'tr that just everyday life?
[0:40:53] <DSD24> He’s going Beyond the Pale for you
[0:41:10] <%derap41> LUL
[0:41:13] <+Jeshk0> shes not wrong
[0:41:15] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:41:15] <+illusiveSaint> LUL
[0:41:22] <%X2Eliah> Smoking cigarettes is SO COOL you guys
[0:41:28] <%Gruhunchously> Might as well be honest
[0:41:29] <dukenux> Not wrong
[0:41:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> I like her VA, but man, she can't speak Portuguese and you can tell
[0:41:44] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> (pergunte à poeira: ask the dust)
[0:42:10] <%TheGunrunner91> She's just going Shivers rn
[0:42:14] <%krispen_wa> Imagine cumming from dying
[0:42:14] <iacus_> dang, I think I missed going so deep in this convo in my game
[0:42:18] <%derap41> Rip Dolores Dei
[0:42:22] <Prevot> this weird mix of Spanish and Portuguese reminds me of Michiko to Hatchin
[0:42:23] <%Gruhunchously> Orgasmic death
[0:42:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Rip Dolores, but I'm different
[0:42:35] <ataxia72> yeah I didn't see this either... I also missed pretty much everything about The Pale
[0:42:35] <luftraumm1> I have no idea how the hell the writers managed to mix Portuguese poetry and Brazilian folk music to create this stuff
[0:42:40] <%X2Eliah> Mental dithering is a scary concept
[0:42:51] <%X2Eliah> Like,literal dithering of thought
[0:42:58] <linSP> Do you even dither bruh
[0:42:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:43:10] <%hax_metatron> What are we doing here chat? monkaS
[0:43:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> she's gone
[0:43:13] <+Sir_Louis> Oh to become vapour...
[0:43:16] <+KillerCrocomire> Return to void
[0:43:16] <%krispen_wa> Depressing woman
[0:43:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> @luftraumm1 easy, all you need is a lot of time and a lot of work LUL
[0:43:21] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the void
[0:43:24] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> someone is really into the end of evangelion
[0:43:25] <%hax_metatron> NotLikeThis It's setting in
[0:43:34] <dukenux> Why are we still here? Just to suffer etc.
[0:43:56] <DSD24> Nostalgia Suit
[0:44:00] <kingra> She LOVES it
[0:44:03] <dukenux> colors of autumn, huh?
[0:44:03] <DSD24> You wear it all the time
[0:44:05] <%Gruhunchously> She loves that shit
[0:44:08] <%X2Eliah> Miseryporn
[0:44:10] <%DashXero> Yo, book me a trip to the void.
[0:44:14] <dukenux> Greypilled
[0:44:14] <iacus_> incredible concept
[0:44:20] <heysamuel> i would do anything for a detailed book on the pale
[0:44:25] <LlewynMarie> i love this woman's accent
[0:44:32] <skyenoz> trapped in the nostalgia of others
[0:44:46] <DSD24> "Yes"
[0:44:46] <%TheGunrunner91> yeah her and Klass I can listen to forever
[0:45:05] <%Juriasu> roleplay woolie
[0:45:06] <%X2Eliah> time 2 overthink
[0:45:09] <unthought> Shivers? Esprit?
[0:45:24] <servicesuspension> You're basically the antipaledriver
[0:45:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> I like 1
[0:45:29] <%krispen_wa> Woolie wants oblivion
[0:45:32] <luftraumm1> klass i can listen to forever for different reasons
[0:45:40] <Miklosher> shivers and espirit kinda gives you memories of others
[0:45:44] <dukenux> 2 is succumbing into nothing
[0:45:46] <+Jeshk0> i always love the poeticism of the repeated phrasing, but different meanings in the responses
[0:45:49] <dukenux> 1 is hanging on
[0:45:50] <%TheGunrunner91> Klass is voice goals
[0:46:20] <skyenoz> like shivers just straight up tells you shit you couldn't have known
[0:46:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> Harrier seems to have an empathy with the memories of places.
[0:46:38] <skyenoz> though most of it is useless but still
[0:46:39] <%krispen_wa> Pure Oblivion
[0:47:31] <%krispen_wa> The Motorway South is Everywhere at the End of Time
[0:47:32] <unthought> Gotta take them shortcuts through the superdeep to get the apricots delivered on schedule.
[0:47:36] <%TheGunrunner91> man what a sentence
[0:47:38] <%Gruhunchously> Koh the Memory Stealer
[0:47:46] <DSD24> New thoughts time
[0:47:59] <%derap41> wrong memories again
[0:48:01] <dukenux> How do you think it took those other people's memories
[0:48:28] <LlewynMarie> Kim hates this stuff probabaly. It scares him I bet
[0:48:33] <marcheries> isn't she? i love her
[0:48:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> Kim isn't a believer.... yet
[0:48:37] <Virokwet> shes up there
[0:48:38] <%Gruhunchously> She's pretty great
[0:48:38] <%TheGunrunner91> yee
[0:48:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sometimes, chat is right
[0:48:39] <heysamuel> paledriver is incredible
[0:48:40] <dukenux> I expected pale to work more like a memory blackhole, but this implies the information can get out
[0:48:42] <DSD24> The Cuno doesn't give a shit about the Pale
[0:48:42] <available_line> Every character is the coolest character.
[0:48:43] <+Jeshk0> uhhh, Kim is standing RIGHT THERE
[0:48:45] <servicesuspension> There's some badass art of her on tumblr... no, really
[0:48:48] <serioustguy> new thought
[0:48:48] <+Vivaciousx3> check out new thought
[0:48:51] <dukenux> shes pretty cool, but eh iunno
[0:48:53] <%MightyDuckShoes> And this is why the chat was going nuts
[0:48:55] <iacus_> her backstory 11/10
[0:48:57] <%hax_metatron> How many characters have you said that about Woolie?
[0:48:59] <Esparsenior> She’s cool … but she’s no Kim
[0:49:00] <%DiscoMatador> RIGHT
[0:49:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'd deduct about 2 points from her VA due to her Portuguese pronunciation.
[0:49:10] <servicesuspension> the idea that someone can just... live my life later, is terrifying
[0:49:11] <%hax_metatron> Woolie every stream: That is the coolest thing in the game
[0:49:11] <%X2Eliah> And Woolie was so close to never talking with her
[0:49:12] <+NaturalZer0> I think that Suuna is my favorite non-Kim K character, but the Paledriver is awesome.
[0:49:13] <%AvroEltz> Almost like we really wanted you to talk to her
[0:49:15] <DSD24> Yo man I love Trig
[0:49:20] <WongOBongO> I love this game
[0:49:23] <iacus_> yo, simulation hypothesis?
[0:49:26] <dukenux> She's super old, and drives a truck
[0:49:40] <%p4ntless> is the pale the backyard
[0:49:41] <%X2Eliah> @iacus_ way more than hypothesis
[0:49:42] <%Gruhunchously> And she lives other people's memories
[0:49:44] <servicesuspension> math stops working
[0:49:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> @hax_metatron I mean, this game is all killer, no filler, so it's to be expected LUL
[0:49:58] <andre11dr> So i talked to her before finding out about the pale and was very confused
[0:49:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:49:59] <Miklosher> forget contant mike tbh
[0:50:02] <%krispen_wa> He WANTS it

[0:50:09] <%X2Eliah> yea

[0:50:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> true
[0:50:14] <%X2Eliah> ditch mike
[0:50:14] <%purps26> yeah you can get rid of it

[0:50:32] <Pt_Kamen> it's one of the important ones
[0:50:41] <%Gruhunchously> This is an important thought for an important check later on
[0:50:42] <%hax_metatron> This game is a golden mine
[0:50:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> Damn, 8 hours? Oh that one is gonna be a next stream thought
[0:50:57] <skyenoz> I love the idea of math and geometry not working deep in the pale
[0:51:02] <unthought> Your mind is trying to comprehend the paleshape
[0:51:06] <dukenux> MC Escher visuals?
[0:51:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> has he talked to lorry drivers?
[0:51:39] <Pt_Kamen> talk to Sindy The Skull

[0:53:56] <%Lion_kun> I've gotten the moralistic quest and saw Pat get the communist quest.
[0:54:14] <dukenux> the "Starving artist" trope is still taking its toll
[0:54:15] <andre11dr> 1 is so stupid LUL
[0:54:20] <%derap41> miss 100% of the shot you don't take mentality
[0:54:33] <%Lion_kun> With woolie doing the ultra Liberal quest the fascist quest is the only one I'll have not seen.
[0:54:34] <%hax_metatron> It's always funny to see people making fun of artists being shit on ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[0:54:38] <%DashXero> It's because you can't eat art.
[0:54:41] <%DashXero> Wait...
[0:54:53] <passserby> Can I get some these groceries for free? I'll pay with exposure.
[0:54:55] <unthought> Unless it's wall-bananas

[1:11:48] <primaryfire> so it was a rhetorics class
[1:11:55] <%X2Eliah> That's honestly a good class
[1:11:58] <rocktimusprime> bro I love art bulshittery
[1:12:01] <%vaderxyz1970> What was the point?
[1:12:03] <%hax_metatron> Woolie went to the Community TV show school
[1:12:03] <glorioushedonist> Savvy will never let us down
[1:12:04] <reonome> I remember a classmate submitting *actual trash* as an assignment for art class
[1:12:09] <%X2Eliah> Bullshitting is what sells the art
[1:12:11] <%derap41> post modernist art is fucking dumb
[1:12:11] <ToxInjection> I would ace art school, wtf
[1:12:11] <dukenux> that's the class that actually allows to make you some money
[1:12:15] <+AmanDotZip> oh yeah, the museum explanations are ridiculous
[1:12:18] <heemwizard> @reonome did he fail lol?
[1:12:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @reonome did they get a good grade, tho
[1:12:30] <linSP> BULLSHITTING IS A SKILL
[1:12:38] <reonome> they didn't fail at least
[1:12:41] <glorioushedonist> NO THE INTEGRITY THO
[1:12:44] <+RowenCleric> honestly art school doesnt teach you to hustle enough
[1:12:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> The Sines weren't aligned, man
[1:12:53] <%Juriasu> @reonome woolieTRASH accept my art
[1:13:04] <reonome> @Juriasu A+
[1:13:13] <%X2Eliah> When entire cateogires of artwork are just paint splotches and smears, you NEED bullshitting
[1:13:14] <%derap41> then take a photo
[1:13:16] <%Juriasu> @Juriasu hell yeah
[1:13:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Juriasu you're not an artist! You're an Artisté
[1:13:34] <%DashXero> Technically proficient, but lacking in drama.
[1:13:36] <tequi1asunset> D
[1:13:36] <%purps26> @WoolieVersus a lot of the devs of this game came out of an art school in estonia
[1:13:37] <Daxalog> "That is what it is"
[1:13:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Like my game dev class, the fun was optional
[1:13:42] <luftraumm1> why not take a photo?
[1:13:47] <+Jeshk0> thats just the way it goes for subjects that are more subjective; talking yourself up is the key way to get ahead
[1:13:53] <dukenux> "Garbage... garbage... derivative"
[1:14:02] <LlewynMarie> not much different than when you have to sell yourself for a normal job
[1:14:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @JetpackMcQuack that's the first lesson of game development, we don't have fun.
[1:14:07] <%derap41> worth it
[1:14:11] <glorioushedonist> do it
[1:14:13] <guiltyboya> I love her
[1:14:14] <DSD24> Ok Kim
[1:14:18] <ingman112> I love that every stage of this requires antagonism and persuasion
[1:14:24] <glorioushedonist> god 10 is the minimum
[1:14:25] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:14:27] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:14:28] <%krispen_wa> LUL

[1:14:37] <servicesuspension> it's almost like the art market is literally just a way to evade taxes
[1:14:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> 10 bucks, she only wanted a pack of smokes
[1:14:40] <%kyh9> That's the best line I've ever heard
[1:14:41] <%AvroEltz> 10 bucks and some exposure
[1:14:55] <%Juriasu> it kind of looks like it's just a rag with some red paint on it though
[1:14:59] <%X2Eliah> booooo
[1:15:00] <DSD24> Nice pun
[1:15:03] <heemwizard> its worth less than that tbh
[1:15:03] <%derap41> What's the scream painting called again
[1:15:06] <%Gruhunchously> sneeze art
[1:15:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> 10 bucks is too much, kick her and run away with it

[1:18:53] <glorioushedonist> you got hustled
[1:18:56] <%hax_metatron> I love the implied terror of this upcoming dialogue from her ... really sells the stakes of the finale of this game

[1:23:07] <heemwizard> @dextralmalin i think they still take time
[1:23:08] <akajaybay> could go buy a dick mullen novel
[1:23:30] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You get extra dialogue now that Kim is with you
[1:23:32] <guiltyboya> I've read Dick Mullen LUL
[1:23:40] <guiltyboya> (two times)
[1:23:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> orgiastic is a great vocab word
[1:23:54] <heemwizard> 333
[1:23:55] <JetpackMcQuack> did you know?
[1:24:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i fucking love kim
[1:24:17] <%krispen_wa> Goddamn Kim
[1:24:23] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Jesus Kim lol
[1:24:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Kim loves cars. It's rad.
[1:24:27] <heemwizard> kim loves his motor carriages
[1:24:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> based greasemonkey kim
[1:24:29] <guiltyboya> Kim is savage
[1:24:29] <%Gruhunchously> Remember that Kim is a car nut
[1:24:30] <skyenoz> Kim LOVES cars
[1:24:34] <heemwizard> he's a tork dork
[1:24:35] <%TheGunrunner91> Kim is a torque dork
[1:24:36] <%derap41> This is a pretty good one
[1:24:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> HOLY SHIT
[1:24:39] <heemwizard> *torque dork
[1:24:41] <%AvroEltz> damn
[1:24:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> THAT'S A *GREAT* ONE
[1:24:49] <laserbeaming> it's not a powerful thought
[1:24:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> what does it do? im in audio only mode
[1:24:49] <dukenux> FeelsBadMan
[1:24:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> Kim definitely takes his carriage to the track every weekend
[1:24:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MIGHT BE THE BEST IN THE GAME
[1:25:00] <shincadad> Hmm
[1:25:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @abelincoln_catpuncher lowers success and failure requirements by 1
[1:25:08] <laserbeaming> @abelincoln_catpuncher critical success and failure thresholds lowered by 1
[1:25:11] <dextralmalin> I heard this thought doesn't work?
[1:25:12] <JetpackMcQuack> nice
[1:25:14] <Inqy833> So does that mean they auto-fail on 2-3 and auto succeed on 11-12?
[1:25:15] <%derap41> good for low stat bad for high stats
[1:25:18] <linSP> It makes a nat 20 from 3% to 8%, but a nat 1 is also easier to get too
[1:25:20] <kingra> Seems good
[1:25:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but auto fail on 3?
[1:25:24] <Pt_Kamen> 1-1, 1-2, 2-1 fails 6-6, 5-6, 6-5 wins
[1:25:24] <ingman112> @Inqy833 I believe that's how it works
[1:25:25] <dukenux> but also fail easier?
[1:25:26] <Deasmeister> or a 3
[1:25:27] <DSD24> This thought bums me out a bit
[1:25:27] <%TheGunrunner91> The only way to load the dice is to keep fighting
[1:25:28] <heysamuel> i really hope this thought works
[1:25:29] <%TheGunrunner91> holy shit
[1:25:29] <%hax_metatron> IT"S GOOD BASIACLLY
[1:25:31] <%hax_metatron> Don't remove it
[1:25:34] <%DashXero> Roll a 3 to fail
[1:25:34] <%kyh9> or 2
[1:25:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think it's requirements. a 12 requirement is now 11. I think.
[1:25:39] <guiltyboya> mhhhh
[1:25:41] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> failure on 2 or 3, success on 11 or 12
[1:25:43] <ingman112> 3 is a failure as well, but 11 is also a success
[1:25:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:25:43] <laserbeaming> no, you roll 3, you fail
[1:25:43] <DSD24> but it slightly hopeful
[1:25:44] <%kyh9> roll 3 and you fail
[1:25:45] <dukenux> roll 3 is also fail
[1:25:47] <Deasmeister> nope a 3 is a failure now
[1:25:47] <akajaybay> 2-3 become fails, 11-12s become wins
[1:25:47] <+Jeshk0> no, it doubles the crit fail and crit success chance
[1:25:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> 3= crit failure @woolieversus
[1:25:51] <%DiscoMatador> 3 and you fail
[1:25:52] <Daxalog> 2 or 3 will kill you now. But you usually fail 3's anyway
[1:25:52] <%derap41> bigger chance of crits
[1:25:57] <nelsonsaysbooya> double crit success and failures
[1:25:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yes
[1:25:59] <RushUnplugged> the best thought
[1:26:03] <%X2Eliah> More cirts
[1:26:10] <%DiscoMatador> 3 id noe s crit fsil too
[1:26:11] <%kyh9> Good shit
[1:26:12] <%derap41> good when you have lowstats
[1:26:17] <Inqy833> It's only a disadavantage if you would normally win on a 3, which doesn't happen often.
[1:26:18] <%MightyDuckShoes> It's a double edged sword
[1:26:21] <akajaybay> better odds on longshots
[1:26:25] <primaryfire> you're playing darkest dungeon at low light
[1:26:27] <dextralmalin> but 3 usually fails anyway
[1:26:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> You gotten a few near wins missing 1 point though, so it's good for you
[1:26:29] <skyenoz> i mean for most checks 2-3 is already a fail
[1:26:34] <%hax_metatron> Snake eyes is like .... super fucking rare and memes. It's okay to not worry about that.
[1:26:37] <fistynopunches> 3 is usually failure anyway
[1:26:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @hax_metatron my gf has had like 10 crit fails lol
[1:26:57] <+illusiveSaint> so rolls are more lenient nice
[1:27:06] <%hax_metatron> @abelincoln_catpuncher NotLikeThis
[1:27:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> sounds useful for pretty unspecialised builds, like yours
[1:27:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> @illusiveSaint but also harsher too
[1:27:19] <serioustguy> empathy
[1:27:26] <%derap41> Gotta dress right to give bad news
[1:27:28] <%hax_metatron> Oh boy, what a choice
[1:27:32] <%MightyDuckShoes> it gives you more reason to roll on almost guaranteed failures
[1:27:34] <Hammatime8> LUl
[1:27:36] <skyenoz> fuck the world my husband is dead
[1:27:37] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[1:27:51] <Pt_Kamen> the funny tie!

[1:28:05] <dextralmalin> Annette ahem
[1:28:18] <%holydeviant1> Yeah, you haven't found the decent hats
[1:28:20] <%derap41> This is almost a look
[1:28:26] <dukenux> Now you need a cowboy hat and you look like Lemmy Motorhead
[1:28:29] <%hax_metatron> A t shirt that says "Your husband is dead, World is a Fuck ... I am trash man"
[1:28:35] <Pt_Kamen> Bratan!

[1:29:58] <%Gruhunchously> upstairs

[1:32:34] <JetpackMcQuack> FUCK THE WORLD
[1:32:34] <available_line> EMPATHY might be needed
[1:32:36] <Esparsenior> ‘Cough’ empathy ‘cough’
[1:32:36] <dukenux> you look like about to deliver bad news
[1:32:37] <+Afrobrawler> Need that empathy
[1:32:39] <taeko_ohnuki> you have all the worst stats for this
[1:32:39] <ingman112> Suggestion: HIT ON THE WIDOW
[1:32:40] <%meniscate> 4 empathy yikes
[1:32:43] <+JustToWatch> it's not a stat debuff but roleplaying wise I would change the jacket
[1:32:44] <notadeasterisk> half life up
[1:32:44] <andre11dr> Is 4 the highest it gets?
[1:32:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1412666647689764864?s=19
[1:32:54] <Dreary_Sun> EMPATHY
[1:32:54] <notadeasterisk> half light up
[1:32:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Might wanna save, just in case
[1:32:57] <%sahr_zand> For the love of, skip that jacket
[1:33:04] <%Gruhunchously> "Your man is dead, get over it"
[1:33:07] <%meniscate> I remember having much higher stats on day 3
[1:33:08] <%TheGunrunner91> Oh man - can you fail this
[1:33:11] <%hax_metatron> No it has to be that jacket
[1:33:13] <taeko_ohnuki> @andre11dr the highest they can get it right now
[1:33:20] <%TheGunrunner91> I dont remember
[1:33:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @andre11dr The diamond pips are the level cap for a stat. His empathy can be increased to 6 + any bonuses from clothing.
[1:33:29] <andre11dr> Yeah that's what i meant
[1:33:29] <%krispen_wa> Empathy: Failure, tell the working class woman that she rides the cock carousel
[1:33:34] <taeko_ohnuki> @TheGunrunner91 there is a bad way of doing it
[1:33:45] <%DashXero> What is that? onion soup?
[1:33:45] <Pt_Kamen> "He wasn't 'That' good of a husband, right? Get a better one now!"
[1:34:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, what is your favorite stat? Doesn't have to be the one you picked to be your main stat when you played.
[1:34:06] <%TheGunrunner91> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:34:07] <%Gruhunchously> "It seems you could have chosen better"
[1:34:13] <dukenux> us?
[1:34:13] <%krispen_wa> Espirit de Corps
[1:34:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> weird
[1:34:25] <unthought> "I came back for another hug."
[1:34:26] <Dreary_Sun> Give "us" a moment?
[1:34:27] <%hax_metatron> That seems like a bug
[1:34:32] <+Jeshk0> FeelsBadMan
[1:34:32] <%hax_metatron> I remember her being voiced
[1:34:35] <Pt_Kamen> Inland - it's actually right about the wildest thing
[1:34:37] <taeko_ohnuki> well, this is it
[1:34:37] <+Meathands> "Definitely not hiding any drugs in here"
[1:34:40] <dextralmalin> composure is honestly a neat one
[1:34:42] <%hax_metatron> Time to steal her items first LUL
[1:34:48] <%krispen_wa> OH THIS MUSIC
[1:34:50] <%Gruhunchously> Oh, they choose NOW to play this song?
[1:34:52] <%X2Eliah> Half Light is kinda wild
[1:34:54] <%TheGunrunner91> @CappuccinoGuil Half Light, just because of the stuff it said to me during my last play
[1:34:56] <iacus_> Jamrock shuffle that house
[1:34:57] <notadeasterisk> don't run
[1:35:02] <Dreary_Sun> Pilfering, not pillaging
[1:35:03] <primaryfire> oh no
[1:35:03] <andre11dr> @cappuccinoguil Probably Inland Empire or Electro Chemistry
[1:35:07] <DSD24> I like Empathy the most
[1:35:07] <Hammatime8> Nah, loot her house for gear Kappa
[1:35:20] <%MightyDuckShoes> go into the rooms
[1:35:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> Did she drop any good loot?
[1:35:24] <%hax_metatron> What a beautiful little diorama
[1:35:26] <dukenux> oh they have that cat clock
[1:35:27] <%Gruhunchously> Suddenly getting This War of Mine vibes
[1:35:28] <%hax_metatron> God the art is so good
[1:35:31] <+Jeshk0> "Hey lady, got any hats I can take?"
[1:35:33] <user_naim> Got any weed in here?
[1:35:33] <andre11dr> Inland Empire is cool but Electro is the most entertaining one
[1:35:38] <laserbeaming> I like how the clock is animated. Really cute
[1:35:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> I like Volition a lot, Reaction Speed is a 2nd favorite
[1:35:38] <ToxInjection> "Miss, your loot is shit."
[1:35:46] <iacus_> there's another room?
[1:36:00] <+Jeshk0> oof
[1:36:01] <iacus_> oh it's that npc!
[1:36:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Missed an entire room, hehe
[1:36:02] <%p4ntless> god this sucks
[1:36:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> RIGHT?
[1:36:07] <%MightyDuckShoes> left
[1:36:08] <guiltyboya> NotLikeThis
[1:36:10] <unthought> I didn't look in the rooms on my playthrough, seemed disrespectful.
[1:36:21] <+Jeshk0> :(
[1:36:27] <%krispen_wa> Oh boy
[1:36:35] <LlewynMarie> Kim'
[1:36:42] <%hax_metatron> Look ... forget the tea alright?
[1:36:48] <dukenux> i think Kim wants to see how you fare
[1:36:51] <%krispen_wa> Oh....
[1:36:59] <shincadad> Man this is rough
[1:37:01] <shincadad> Fuck
[1:37:01] <%Juriasu> :(
[1:37:02] <heysamuel> kim doesn't do emotions well
[1:37:02] <taeko_ohnuki> no small talk
[1:37:03] <%X2Eliah> Well she can pick up Victor's *body* from the station
[1:37:06] <plan_Backfire> :(
[1:37:09] <Dreary_Sun> this is a super heavy convo
[1:37:10] <%derap41> 2 LUL
[1:37:12] <%Gruhunchously> Not now Rhetoric, jeez
[1:37:13] <iacus_> who are you going to trust?
[1:37:16] <Esparsenior> God …I had to save scum this
[1:37:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rhetoric was trying to protect you?
[1:37:22] <%insertdisc5> boss battle
[1:37:22] <%whyskeywolfe> Rhetoric just wants to talk.
[1:37:23] <muXPerience> a muscle wants to flex
[1:37:26] <%X2Eliah> Yeah small talk is such a stupid thing to do here
[1:37:27] <heemwizard> oh you not going to pass this check
[1:37:27] <luftraumm1> rhetoric is an asshole
[1:37:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> I never quite understood what Rhetoric is about
[1:37:29] <%krispen_wa> YOU CANT TRUST ANYONE
[1:37:30] <%p4ntless> this is so much worse than my playthrough, I didn't get the glomp or the awkward bonding moment first
[1:37:33] <laserbeaming> suggestion is in the right here
[1:37:36] <Daxalog> Rehtoric is just talking
[1:37:38] <Inqy833> Wow, suggestion actually made a good point for once.
[1:37:39] <guiltyboya> Rhetoric can go eff itself
[1:37:41] <%insertdisc5> they're trying!!!
[1:37:43] <JetpackMcQuack> not this time buddy
[1:37:44] <Dreary_Sun> empathyyy\
[1:37:44] <Picia000123> Suggestion is on the bal
[1:37:47] <%AvroEltz> yeah, facts and arguments dont care about her feelings
[1:37:48] <heemwizard> of course they can
[1:37:50] <user_naim> rhetoric loves talking it up, suggestion is trying to... well something helpful i guess
[1:37:52] <DSD24> Oh god that Empathy check
[1:37:53] <luftraumm1> rhetoric can't read ppl
[1:37:55] <%hax_metatron> Suggestion is Charm in other RPG systems basically
[1:37:59] <skyenoz> There's no logic in telling someone their husband is dead
[1:37:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> I appreciate the attempt, Rhetoric, but we gotta do what's right
[1:38:01] <%holydeviant1> Rhetoric is about dominating a convo, he is out of hiselement here
[1:38:01] <unthought> If only this woman were more political...
[1:38:03] <iacus_> too hight stats have those drawbacks. it's in the skills description
[1:38:03] <ingman112> Rhetoric wants to win the argument, but there isn't a way to win here
[1:38:04] <+Jeshk0> oh yeah, listening to the wrong stat at the wrong time can be big bad
[1:38:04] <tequi1asunset> Stats try there best but are fallable
[1:38:06] <Daxalog> I mean. You can trust Electro chemistry and shivers.
[1:38:08] <%vaderxyz1970> They are interpreting how they can
[1:38:08] <%meniscate> Ayoo gonna fail yooo
[1:38:10] <JetpackMcQuack> super cool
[1:38:10] <+illusiveSaint> its like human mind having conflicting ideas
[1:38:17] <Esparsenior> Rhetoric is doing what he does … his purpose is to talk … so he wants to talk
[1:38:18] <Inqy833> Suggestion wants people to like you. Rhetoric wants to win arguments.
[1:38:19] <+trinto2> I like both the fail and success of this check
[1:38:20] <%X2Eliah> 83% go

[1:41:14] <%X2Eliah> Woolie what do you think is the right answer?
[1:41:16] <skyenoz> Woolie is going full rhetoric here
[1:41:17] <dukenux> You don't tell victim's family what coroner knows, Woolie
[1:41:17] <nelsonsaysbooya> 2 days is not long
[1:41:24] <JetpackMcQuack> "intentionally vague"
[1:41:25] <iacus_> it's a... "different phrasing"
[1:41:25] <%DiscoMatador> Reggie the real One
[1:41:28] <Chatterbox1991> there's a difference between lies and withholding truths
[1:41:28] <taeko_ohnuki> it's a while for a missing person
[1:41:33] <+Vigonept> man thatd br cruel
[1:41:34] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> she doesn't need to know this at this moment, later, when she has more time to process
[1:41:34] <tequi1asunset> @nelsonsaysbooya For a loved one it is
[1:41:35] <heemwizard> 1
[1:41:35] <%AvroEltz> for a missing person id say is long
[1:41:38] <%Lion_kun> Reggie the pure god
[1:41:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> That's a weekend!
[1:41:44] <taeko_ohnuki> @tequi1asunset exactly
[1:41:47] <%TheGunrunner91> @nelsonsaysbooya to be told your husband was just lying out in the shit. yes, it is
[1:41:47] <nelsonsaysbooya> @nelsonsaysbooya Fair
[1:41:48] <Inqy833> I think Kim will understand here.
[1:41:57] <%p4ntless> pay it forward
[1:42:05] <LlewynMarie> the one you wiped your vomit on
[1:42:10] <unthought> Still smelling of your vomit from the cadaver.
[1:42:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, reminder: 2 days ago, you talked to her about her husband been gone and she made light of it.
[1:42:14] <tequi1asunset> No
[1:42:16] <%holydeviant1> oh god, more family
[1:42:17] <user_naim> @llewynmarie shh
[1:42:22] <%krispen_wa> Oh god
[1:42:26] <user_naim> nevermind the vomit
[1:42:29] <Chatterbox1991> fucking Empathy MVP
[1:42:39] <%holydeviant1> Empathy holding it down!
[1:42:46] <%derap41> Her portrait doesn't feel the same anymore
[1:42:46] <%Gruhunchously> You need Empathy in a situation like this
[1:42:55] <available_line> Empathy is not even checking this, it's just DOING it. It's that important.
[1:42:56] <%X2Eliah> I wonder how an empathy failure dialogue lookjs like here
[1:42:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> When you pass a check roll, the stat kinda just gets free reign until you're done.
[1:43:01] <%Juriasu> Empathy has come a long way since the carousel
[1:43:01] <Reveresao> You passed the first check the rest is the followup
[1:43:02] <tequi1asunset> Man that Fuck the World jacket wasn't the best choice huh? lol
[1:43:26] <%krispen_wa> that was a weird drama check
[1:43:29] <+trinto2> @X2Eliah you become overwhelmed and try to back out of telling her, and when you do tell her, you do it in a way that rattles her
[1:43:37] <%Gruhunchously> @tequi1asunset She wont see the back of it...as long as you leave the room walking backwards
[1:43:40] <%TheGunrunner91> oh jeez
[1:43:44] <+xTJPBQdfNHA7qUxeTd5Uy9gV> it was a drama check because it may be a lie -- I don't know if the body got picked up yet
[1:43:44] <%insertdisc5> @trinto2 oofa doofa :(
[1:43:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> Interesting that Drama chimed in there. Perhaps because it's a performance? Like, what the cops are told to do in these situation and it recognizes the moves?
[1:43:51] <AngryAsian5> Yep
[1:43:54] <%DashXero> Yeah.
[1:44:00] <tequi1asunset> @tequi1asunset Moonwalk out the scene
[1:44:01] <%mariothemaio> boy we have come a long way from harassing her by the store huh
[1:44:01] <%derap41> that went well
[1:44:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> grief like that takes a physicaly toll no matter how old you are
[1:44:06] <%krispen_wa> It literally happens to you in this game
[1:44:06] <skyenoz> it's physical damage
[1:44:07] <%Gruhunchously> *STATIC*
[1:44:07] <LlewynMarie> not gonna lie, the first time I played this part, I cried
[1:44:07] <%TheGunrunner91> GOD THE STATIC HITS
[1:44:07] <%kyh9> Physical + Empathy is an interesting combination
[1:44:13] <%hax_metatron> I think that's true at any age
[1:44:15] <%X2Eliah> QUEST COMPLETE +10 EXP
[1:44:16] <%holydeviant1> probably how she feels!

[1:44:38] <andre11dr> Physical Instrument is so interesting, it tells you when people get physically weak, this game man
[1:44:42] <+Jeshk0> i dont even wanna know what failing that empathy check looks like
[1:44:47] <%insertdisc5> fuck the world, keep on living
[1:44:48] <LlewynMarie> @tattleworm really? gonna have to try that
[1:45:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @hax_metatron Grief scars, leaves damage on you. The older you are, more often do you have to grief over loss, and the harder they hit.
[1:45:09] <heemwizard> well she has a 16 and 18 yr old daughter

[1:48:32] <brunoberserk> THE LIGHTBRINGER
[1:48:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> Several different evolutionary branches created a crab, it's called carcinisation, technically king crabs aren't true crabs or some weird shit

[1:51:25] <dukenux> 4 opens extra dialogue
[1:51:25] <iacus_> I guess 1
[1:51:27] <%sahr_zand> They're all good
[1:51:29] <%hax_metatron> 222
[1:51:33] <%X2Eliah> 2 sucks, 4 maybe will backfire? idk
[1:51:38] <Reveresao> USE YOUR ART CLASSES @WoolieVersus
[1:51:39] <iacus_> 1 if you want him to believe it will get valuable
[1:51:40] <guiltyboya> TRU

[1:51:45] <notadeasterisk> 2
[1:51:46] <%insertdisc5> i like 4. make him work for it
[1:51:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Forces him, or passes the buck from you?
[1:51:46] <primaryfire> 3 is a double sided sword
[1:51:47] <styptysat> 4444
[1:51:50] <andre11dr> I'd do 1
[1:51:50] <%X2Eliah> 3 deffo will backfire imo
[1:51:53] <%insertdisc5> 3 brings the value down
[1:51:54] <%derap41> 2 is complete crap
[1:51:56] <tequi1asunset> 1 would egg him on
[1:51:59] <%DashXero> The prospect of a dead artist increases value.
[1:52:01] <heemwizard> those are lot of wrong answers
[1:52:04] <enZymeth> 3 actually works too
[1:52:05] <+Jeshk0> he'd prolly get a boner for 2

[2:01:09] <+Bitscreed> I'd legit pick Cuno over IDS

[2:01:13] <%X2Eliah> IDS sounds like a terrible pick
[2:01:17] <Umbra_6> So cool, never get any of this in my playthrough.
[2:01:20] <%holydeviant1> IDS is like a black hole of money

[2:02:22] <+Mendin> Fail at the Failure, do The Producers
[2:02:22] <+Vigonept> TRY IT
[2:02:27] <luftraumm1> sure to FAIL
[2:02:34] <%X2Eliah> fail the failure plan
[2:02:35] <tattleworm> failing either one of those checks will actually count as succeeding as the opposite one
[2:02:37] <%holydeviant1> To be honest, after Harry gets home, he's probably gonna stare at that share for an hour before realizing he just sold a fucking sneeze for hundreds of dollars
[2:02:45] <Picia000123> watch Woolie get it right at failure, thus failing LUL

[2:05:52] <Dreary_Sun> I like how the outlin remains, even has Harry is warped beyond recognition
[2:05:56] <%Gruhunchously> Fail upwards
[2:06:07] <Eger007> pick a lower one

[2:59:47] <andre11dr> Of course, it's actually about being THE SPECIAL GUY THAT FINDS IT

[2:59:52] <FassieFons> yes good woolie
[2:59:53] <Picia000123> for the CONTENT Woolie
[2:59:54] <serioustguy> go for her
[2:59:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Nooooo
[2:59:57] <%Juriasu> no she doesn't
[2:59:59] <ingman112> Yep
[3:00:00] <%hax_metatron> She leaves at 11
[3:00:01] <Miseryfell> 2300
[3:00:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> She leaves at 11
[3:00:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no she leaves at 11, you can make kim leave at 9
[3:00:07] <laserbeaming> she leaves at 23
[3:00:09] <Elf_Planator> she doesnt
[3:00:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> Kim leaves at 9
[3:00:13] <ingman112> You have to go to your room at 9, to get Kim to go
[3:00:14] <%hax_metatron> In the morning
[3:00:15] <dukenux> wait who
[3:00:15] <iacus_> This sidequest actively gives you a worse game ending, narratively (in my opinion)
[3:00:22] <Dopamien> 🤷 idk lol
[3:00:26] <%meniscate> White Mourning is useless and can mess with a future sidequest. It's buggy
[3:00:26] <%MightyDuckShoes> 9-11 Never forget
[3:00:28] <diddlerriddler> but you don't have to get rid of kim
[3:00:31] <Blackleafx> @iacus_ which?
[3:00:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Karaoke, Kim gone, Klaasje?
[3:00:49] <skyenoz> but why does he wanna get rid of Kim?
[3:00:50] <iacus_> @Blackleafx the insulindian phasmid one
[3:00:51] <serioustguy> you still have to talk to her about the case @woolieversus
[3:00:54] <hamsaddich> I assume he means the ultralib quest
[3:00:55] <Pt_Kamen> you can talk to her NOW
[3:00:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait thats too many K's guys
[3:01:06] <laserbeaming> Kim has to witness the singing
[3:01:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Pt_Kamen there's a quest to talk to her alone
[3:01:09] <Blackleafx> @iacus_ ok i VERY much disagree with that take, but your call
[3:01:11] <%MightyDuckShoes> Da 3 Ks
[3:01:11] <%AvroEltz> it can be after 9, you just cant go to kims room

[3:01:32] <%whyskeywolfe> You wanna talk to Klasje when the sky is clear.
[3:01:38] <shincadad> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:01:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you need to talk to her about the tape, and also about you by yourself
[3:01:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> You need to talk to her with Kim AND without Kim, they are separate quests
[3:01:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Call it K^3, thats friendlier right?
[3:01:47] <hamsaddich> The insulindian quest is worth it imo
[3:01:48] <dukenux> @woolieversus talk to Sunday friend?
[3:01:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @dukenux sunday friend gone
[3:02:08] <dukenux> oh nevermind then
[3:02:10] <Deasmeister> @dukenux I thought he left?
[3:02:11] <%whyskeywolfe> mmmmmaybe
[3:02:24] <iacus_> @Blackleafx I thought it really took away from the poignancy of the ending by giving it an easy out explanation for the events Can't really comment more without spoilers
[3:02:29] <dukenux> thought hed have to say sonething about stonks
[3:02:47] <%vaderxyz1970> What if Kim still has to pay 20 real for the night
[3:02:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo, nice contextual dialogue

[3:15:54] <tomo_vendor> its a reference to the corpse talk
[3:15:55] <Miklosher> that *love did him in*
[3:15:58] <%Gruhunchously> "IT was love that did me in" the corpse said.
[3:15:58] <servicesuspension> can you dunk on a woman for her taste in men if her taste in men is war criminals

[3:20:41] <a_bald_bro> i'd guess 40s tbh
[3:20:41] <crocboyz> he is 12 years old
[3:20:42] <%Irridium> a grizzled 17 year old
[3:20:43] <Fuji808> Were on the verge of a Hans Moleman bit.

[3:20:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> Harry is late 30s MINIMUM
[3:20:53] <gunsrlove> ish*
[3:20:56] <Blackleafx> You can actually figure his age out pretty well by the fact he says he was a young guy back when disco was hot
[3:20:57] <iacus_> 15 year old from Baki
[3:20:57] <heysamuel> "good"
[3:20:59] <Picia000123> in the middle

[3:21:02] <justcallmebobplease> Those are the year of birth, not the age, peeps

[3:21:04] <zanzibarian_hamster> Alcohol ages you like fuck
[3:21:05] <user_naim> cope for so long means probably 40s
[3:21:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @zanzibarian_hamster literally, it's the lowest answer LUL
[3:21:07] <%X2Eliah> Harry is bad eastern-european 45
[3:21:09] <user_naim> rough 40s

[3:22:03] <heemwizard> get col do ma ma daqua
[3:22:03] <user_naim> get it? Like a date of death generator
[3:22:09] <%X2Eliah> .... Might want to dump hobocop
[3:22:10] <%MightyDuckShoes> You have an ID Harrier!
[3:22:10] <Esparsenior> Col do ma ma daqua time
[3:22:22] <%meniscate> Forget White Mourning
[3:22:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> Yeah doesn't your ID have your DOB on it? Most do
[3:22:32] <Miklosher> maybe hobo
[3:22:35] <ingman112> Jamrock shuffle is less important
[3:22:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> hobocop/
[3:22:40] <heemwizard> this thought is quite useless by comparison to do ma ma daqua
[3:22:42] <%meniscate> White Mourning is buggy
[3:22:42] <%vaderxyz1970> 15th indo tribe i guess
[3:22:42] <heart_ablaze> I'd say get rid of superstar
[3:22:43] <ingman112> You don't need hobocop anymore
[3:22:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> @zanzibarian_hamster it's not an ID, tho, it's a badge
[3:22:45] <%krispen_wa> jamrock shuffle is pretty useless
[3:22:47] <andre11dr> Now how much do you care about your age?
[3:22:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Jamrock seems pretty useless
[3:22:59] <iacus_> nooo
[3:22:59] <%MightyDuckShoes> gotta start clearing out your cabinet
[3:23:02] <heemwizard> dont take it off
[3:23:04] <iacus_> don't forget the armor one
[3:23:07] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Keep the armour thought woolz
[3:23:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> indotribe
[3:23:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> jamroxk shuffle isn't helpful anymore
[3:23:12] <%meniscate> White Mourning messes up a side quest. Big BUG
[3:23:13] <Picia000123> hobocop could go
[3:23:13] <heemwizard> take jamrock shuffle or hobocop
[3:23:15] <primaryfire> gotta be a lil more picky about thoughts
[3:23:16] <ingman112> I say hobocop or jamrock shuffle
[3:23:17] <skyenoz> Fairweather is TOO specific to get rid of
[3:23:18] <+Vigonept> indo tribe, or white mourning
[3:23:20] <andre11dr> I would keep the armour one on
[3:23:20] <iacus_> remove hobocop
[3:23:28] <Miklosher> yeah fuck the hobo
[3:23:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> We're seeing big "White Mourning Bugs Stuff" comments
[3:23:37] <laserbeaming> take off indotribe?
[3:23:41] <iacus_> you're already at 6 shivers tho
[3:23:42] <Esparsenior> Fuck hobo, you hustle
[3:23:43] <andre11dr> Yeah your not really using Hobo cop
[3:23:43] <ingman112> Hobocop and jamrock shuffle are good choices to ditch. The shivers cap is already raised from apocalypse cop
[3:23:46] <%meniscate> White Mourning is buggy. Messes up the church scene
[3:23:48] <FassieFons> already got the most out of hobo
[3:23:50] <+Jeshk0> shed your hobocop past, embrace the hustlercop
[3:23:51] <lksrkson> isn't precarious world only useful on 3% checks
[3:23:52] <crocboyz> are ducks real
[3:23:52] <%vaderxyz1970> hobo cop and indo arent that usefull when you got this much net worth
[3:23:52] <%Gruhunchously> Maybe get rid of White Mourning just to be safe
[3:23:53] <tomo_vendor> remove all thoughts PogChamp
[3:24:01] <@Solidus_113> head empty
[3:24:08] <available_line> chat says white morning is bugged
[3:24:11] <%MightyDuckShoes> No Thoughts Head Empty
[3:24:15] <JetpackMcQuack> no longer a hobo :(
[3:24:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you remove hobocop, you can't learn more shivers
[3:24:28] <andre11dr> Your not really using Hobo cop
[3:24:30] <%Gruhunchously> Just drink yourself stupid again and get rid of all thoughts
[3:24:31] <heysamuel> shivers is already at 8, it's chill
[3:24:41] <heemwizard> take off jamrock
[3:24:42] <%meniscate> White Mourning is BUGGY
[3:24:44] <andre11dr> Your HUSTLE now no point for hobo
[3:24:44] <%bread_assassin> We got Net worth now. Out hobo days are over.
[3:24:44] <+Vigonept> get col do ma ma da qua in there
[3:24:46] <%X2Eliah> jamrock is not that good
[3:24:47] <heemwizard> get daqua
[3:24:48] <skyenoz> @cobalt_phoenix_ Cop of the apocalypse already raises it to 6
[3:24:49] <user_naim> To rock rhyme that’s right on time
[3:24:50] <tomo_vendor> jamrock is the most safe one
[3:24:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @skyenoz ah trye
[3:24:56] <heysamuel> and yeah, gotta add into the white mourning being buggy as hell
[3:25:01] <%MightyDuckShoes> what's wrong with white mourning? how is it bugged?
[3:25:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> true*
[3:25:06] <%meniscate> Zooming out makes some things glitchy
[3:25:06] <ingman112> Apocalypse Cop is already raising the Shivers cap, which makes Hobocop redundant
[3:25:06] <Spinydoughnut33> you're not hobo-ing it up anymore
[3:25:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Based on what you are using, it'd be Hobo or Jamrock
[3:25:29] <%meniscate> It messes up the end of the church quest.
[3:25:37] <%meniscate> It freezes the game
[3:25:40] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus There are almost 0 "locked" containers btw, jamrock shuffle applies barely never
[3:25:44] <andre11dr> Well your actually doing Apocalypse cop
[3:25:51] <luftraumm1> locked container loot SOUNDS good but in fact its not
[3:25:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> You have a pad now
[3:25:53] <heemwizard> @meniscate thought they fixed the bug
[3:25:53] <%Gruhunchously> Honestly I would not have expected this game to have micromanaging
[3:25:55] <andre11dr> You're not really using hobo cop
[3:26:00] <iacus_> you're flush with cash now
[3:26:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1412666647689764864?s=19
[3:26:05] <ingman112> I haven't experienced the white mourning bug
[3:26:06] <%MightyDuckShoes> @meniscate Oh wow. So that's what that was :(
[3:26:06] <Project205> can't you raise the cap with a level up? Genuine question, since there is a + to the left in your skill screen
[3:26:07] <+Jeshk0> its a hustler's life from now on
[3:26:10] <lc_cl7> HOBO TO MEGARICH

[3:26:33] <%meniscate> The bug is still there
[3:26:37] <heemwizard> @meniscate turn down one of the graphics settings
[3:26:37] <Spinydoughnut33> Ma Ma Daqua is amazing
[3:26:44] <skyenoz> Co de ma ma daqua for the MEMES
[3:26:47] <Esparsenior> Find out about those crytoids!
[3:26:47] <%meniscate> It's a pain to do that
[3:26:48] <andre11dr> Maybe wait a little to see what shows up
[3:26:53] <heysamuel> good choice

[3:29:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @available_line too early
[3:29:03] <ingman112> @WoolieVersus If you want to keep Jamrock, Indotribe is probably the next one to ditch. Either way, both have diminishing returns as the game progresses
[3:29:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> 32 minutes to dice time yeyeyeyeye

[3:30:35] <andre11dr> Oh God, i know what Woolie is thinking LUL
[3:30:43] <iacus_> yeah but here it's evoking a specific phrase
[3:30:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> The game lets you be a racist fascist sexist etc but "locker room talk" is where you draw the line?
[3:30:54] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 15 months of Sigma Trillionaire Grindset. Let's get this bread!

[3:31:53] <user_naim> Copter has door, door has gun
[3:31:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> "A door gunner is a crewman tasked with firing and maintaining manually directed armament aboard a military helicopter." according to google

[4:15:03] <themrslimeguy> she knows way too much to be a white collar criminal
[4:15:09] <seriousink> this is great - you can see Reggie's super into this and Woolie is absolutely in "bullshit detector" mode.
[4:15:20] <user_naim> This game taught me several murder tricks
[4:15:55] <+Funkyfjord> this game is crafty if you pick up on it for sure
[4:15:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:16:10] <dukenux> ping pong
[4:16:18] <Josef_Stryker> Did Woolie ever open the other door?

[4:18:34] <%Gruhunchously> Huh, about that
[4:18:36] <themrslimeguy> you know it was from a rifle
[4:18:37] <laserbeaming> VC has your back
[4:18:41] <%Javaa01> It would cause the bullet to tumble, not so much slow it down
[4:18:44] <%X2Eliah> ye
[4:18:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wasn't it a hollow point (or equivelent)? The bullet expanded
[4:19:00] <servicesuspension> the gun factor
[4:19:03] <%X2Eliah> gunshot is like 10x louder than glass breaking
[4:19:05] <+jai_sus> Isn't disco elysium set in their custom d&d world?
[4:19:08] <+Vigonept> it was jacketed that all they know no?

[4:38:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> @jai_sus If you arrest her, her name goes on the Moralintern's records and the people hunting her get a big bright target to aim.
[4:38:51] <andre11dr> Now being over love, is kinda nuts
[4:38:52] <servicesuspension> IT WAS THE GAY AGENDA ALL ALONG

[4:39:05] <%TheFabledAble> shes dumping this on you last second to shift blame, shes even tugging on your heart strings by playing the victim in this circumstance
[4:39:09] <skyenoz> Never trust these men of Wö
[4:39:10] <%DashXero> Mercy is for the foolish and weak.
[4:39:12] <ManlyMcBeefington> desperate?
[4:39:15] <a_bald_bro> desperation woolie!!!
[4:39:22] <%Gruhunchously> Desperate
[4:39:22] <%TheFabledAble> desperation

[4:39:24] <+Meathands> Lying for any reason to save her own skin?
[4:39:24] <a_bald_bro> she's trying not to get arrested
[4:39:25] <justcallmebobplease> Desperate deflection.
[4:39:27] <3rdRunner> ACE ATTORNEY BREAKDOWN
[4:39:28] <%meniscate> Yes Woolie

[4:40:04] <Blank9> You get her in a secure cell she won't run from.

[4:40:52] <ShaqAttackInABurlapSack> Woolie is COMPROMISED
[4:40:53] <%krispen_wa> BELLS?
[4:40:54] <%X2Eliah> not now moobot
[4:40:56] <skyenoz> IT'S REAL
[4:40:59] <%krispen_wa> THE QUEEN BEAST?
[4:41:03] <notadeasterisk> she's just guessing
[4:41:11] <leinadtonu> Is woolie compromised tho?
[4:41:11] <notadeasterisk> about another person
[4:41:12] <%Gruhunchously> @servicesuspension Let her go but tell her not to do it again
[4:41:17] <%meniscate> Based Woolie
[4:41:32] <Dogking16> You need to check in onRuby but this chick needs to he arrested!
[4:41:35] <shameimarusen> Squeeze her dry then cuff her sssire
[4:41:37] <%SomeAsianDood> arrest her. Just do it incredibly slowly @servicesuspension
[4:41:41] <Blackleafx> I hear a sound
[4:41:41] <%TheFabledAble> again this is all hersay from THE PERSON YOURE ABOUT TO ARREST
[4:41:44] <Dogking16> @shameimarusen Agreed
[4:41:44] <notadeasterisk> if she knew why wait for you to come downstaits
[4:41:50] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It was Doug Bell Woolie Doug Bell made the sound
[4:41:52] <%Irridium> because she's not entirely sure it was her
[4:41:53] <%meniscate> Because she's a L I A R
[4:42:04] <+MrATheGreat> Is logic still comped?
[4:42:11] <ariszed> Volition too!
[4:42:15] <DSD24> I am pretty sure everyone still is
[4:42:15] <Prevot> Ruby was already sus but her bringin this up now is also sus
[4:42:19] <%Irridium> she's throwing something out to hopefully not get arrested
[4:42:28] <%SomeAsianDood> Drama has been "uncompromised"
[4:42:33] <%TheFabledAble> dont play into her hersay, she's lied to you douzens of times now, DONT ENABLE HER STORY
[4:42:38] <JetpackMcQuack> monkaS lie
[4:42:39] <%X2Eliah> wasn't Ruby literally sitting downstairs tho
[4:42:42] <+mechslayer71> @notadeasterisk because that would be way too obvious
[4:42:42] <%meniscate> Drama has become redpilled
[4:42:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @servicesuspension
[4:42:50] <ingman112> It's either: is she between a rock and a hard place? Or is she the biggest liar ever
[4:42:57] <notadeasterisk> if this here in our world she would have been arrested long ago
[4:42:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Drama doesn't trust these Men of Wö
[4:43:00] <andre11dr> The one problem with this is how did Ruby shot him then run downstairs so fast
[4:43:03] <justcallmebobplease> Why are you expecting a deflecting liar to eventually tell you the truth?
[4:43:03] <ManlyMcBeefington> @X2Eliah ruby is not seen in-game yet
[4:43:09] <servicesuspension> sell out your girlfriend for more time on the clock
[4:43:14] <%DashXero> Welcome to hell, Spy.
[4:43:22] <elshadow7> Drama is so uncompromised, he's compromised again.
[4:43:32] <servicesuspension> all intended
[4:43:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nothing is ever her fault, huh?
[4:43:36] <%Gruhunchously> You guys should have done the drug lorry quest
[4:43:38] <Miklosher> Yeah you skipped all the ruby stuff up until now
[4:43:38] <%X2Eliah> @ManlyMcBeefington ya ofc but didnt Klaajse said she went downstairs and saw ruby there
[4:43:44] <ingman112> @Gruhunchously We'll get there
[4:43:49] <%meniscate> Maybe if you did the drug trade first...

[4:45:42] <flubdy_> ARREST HER MY LIEGE
[4:45:42] <+projectmanatees> leave her alone shes got a ciggie shes cool
[4:45:42] <ingman112> If need be, you can wait and do this again later
[4:45:43] <penitentpendant> Too much evidence doesn't point to her at the moment
[4:45:45] <servicesuspension> I really don't know
[4:45:45] <iacus_> it is your call
[4:45:46] <%vaderxyz1970> Can't trust her
[4:45:46] <Esparsenior> Ignore chat Woolie … we’re all compromised
[4:45:47] <+MrATheGreat> THINK DETECTIVE
[4:45:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> she probably wouldn't die if she jumped
[4:45:47] <andre11dr> There's a roof there she can't jump Woolie
[4:45:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Guys, Woolie is probably afraid because she keeps backing up to the railing OF A 3 STORY BUILDING
[4:45:52] <notadeasterisk> she could run away
[4:45:55] <+DenpaDev> i predict woolie will be nice
[4:45:56] <heemwizard> @ingman112 can you?
[4:45:59] <Miklosher> let the blood-fueled machine of democracy consume her
[4:46:00] <Blank9> arresting her just means putting her in a cell
[4:46:01] <+AWKWARDL0SER> In jail you’d know where she is
[4:46:01] <Dogking16> @ingman112 Not really he can't!
[4:46:05] <laserbeaming> she's not going anywhere (yet), you can arrest her later
[4:46:06] <+MrATheGreat> Bro man volition

[4:46:11] <BurdRightsActivist> VOLITION
[4:46:13] <rocktimusprime> put on the cuffs
[4:46:15] <heemwizard> you only get one chance to arrest her
[4:46:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> theres a roof then a balcony and even then it's like 20ft total
[4:46:18] <justcallmebobplease> Those are parenthesis, Woolie
[4:46:19] <heemwizard> which is too bad
[4:46:21] <ingman112> @heemwizard He can come back to the roof and initiate this arrest again. He doesn't have to decide in this moment is all

[4:46:31] <%Gruhunchously> What do you mean subtitles bet-
[4:46:32] <%TheFabledAble> shes giving you all this bs about ruby to play to your sympathy so that you dont arrest her, giving you other leads to follow that dont implicate her
[4:46:34] <skyenoz> she's definitely guilty but does she deserve to die by the moralinterns hand?
[4:46:34] <%Irridium> ah yes a Yakuza cutscene

[4:46:50] <iacus_> I still maintain that Glass him was completely understandable in context
[4:46:51] <linSP> Where the dog a-
[4:46:51] <penitentpendant> You can change your mind later, if you don't arrest her now
[4:46:53] <%Gruhunchously> You don't know that she's guilty though
[4:46:59] <+MrATheGreat> Woolie called for an assist
[4:47:02] <%meniscate> Do it for your Moralintern masters
[4:47:02] <servicesuspension> She did do the Shadowrun and hurt thousands. Also war crimes make her horny
[4:47:04] <%SomeAsianDood> Everything looks o-
[4:47:09] <%MightyDuckShoes> Man Emote only would be a good idea now
[4:47:13] <Ziegsy> @iacus_ as a brit, glass him was obvious
[4:47:16] <%TheFabledAble> YOU CANT TRUST IT, She's lied to you like 4 times
[4:47:18] <heemwizard> @Gruhunchously she's guilty of indirectly causing multiple suicides

[4:48:04] <%Irridium> you could investigate that door first
[4:48:06] <iacus_> not a fascist playthrough tho
[4:48:12] <+airchrysalis> will you uphold the law or perish like a dog
[4:48:12] <%TheFabledAble> @servicesuspension she lied about pertinent details about the case several times, and tried to throw a friend under the bus to stay out of being arrested

[4:55:01] <+MrATheGreat> Gotta love Logic's last stand with that. "But you'll be without Kim tho."
[4:55:01] <+airchrysalis> she can't spell out the window ballistics now
[4:55:02] <+Afrobrawler> wasn't there supposed to have been a shivers check?
[4:55:02] <+Vivaciousx3> do you thought? Kappa
[4:55:06] <laserbeaming> There's a benefit for dumb characters to let her off with a station call.
[4:55:08] <%Gruhunchously> Is it though?
[4:55:08] <%bread_assassin> Guess we’re putting off karaoke.

[4:55:28] <3rdRunner> You Defeated
[4:55:29] <Picia000123> did you though
[4:55:34] <resloxxx> opposed to what? letting her run away? she is already a fugitive
[4:55:35] <BurdRightsActivist> YOU DEFEATED
[4:55:35] <Esparsenior> DID YOU?
[4:55:36] <iacus_> Oh crap now you have to wait till tomorrow for karaoke...

[4:55:44] <+TwitchZoomer2021> SeemsGood
[4:55:45] <HarpuiaRivers> Any other headphone user uncomfortable with Woolie's soft narration directly into your ears?
[4:55:46] <heemwizard> @Irridium he failed the check
[4:55:52] <skyenoz> So no Kim for the entire day
[4:55:53] <%Gruhunchously> Temptaion
[4:55:54] <HarpuiaRivers> NotLikeThis
[4:55:58] <+Bitscreed> Kim being out of the way means more time for cryptids.
[4:56:00] <+MrATheGreat> LUL woolie confirming his ideas
[4:56:01] <leinadtonu> resist temptation.
[4:56:03] <crunchington001> Score one for the price stabilité
[4:56:07] <heemwizard> check the window
[4:56:08] <+AWKWARDL0SER> The door!

[4:56:13] <kingra> HYPER SANE
[4:56:14] <a_bald_bro> I've never seen anyone run out of time but I'm pretty sure its gonna happen at this point
[4:56:15] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Level up to open the door
[4:56:17] <+fetrigon> @mrathegreat OMEGALUL
[4:56:25] <+Vivaciousx3> who wants to be hypersane anyway
[4:56:29] <servicesuspension> yeah, the door
[4:56:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> Isn't the joker hypersane?
[4:56:32] <+Jiggisnipe> kind of a killjoy but Volition is best boi
[4:56:38] <+Wolf_EX29> doodGood
[4:56:42] <+MrATheGreat> That sounds like a good voice to listen too
[4:56:45] <%Gruhunchously> HARDCORE
[4:56:46] <shincadad> Irreversible mistakes huh
[4:56:48] <primaryfire> worked into a shoot?
[4:56:49] <Reveresao> Makes you follow rules to letter
[4:56:53] <user_naim> nothing gets my goat like irreversible mistakes
[4:56:53] <%illtima> I fucking love how seriously you two take it
[4:56:55] <%meniscate> Fascism route underdog?
[4:56:55] <servicesuspension> I don't think the joker's hypersan,e the doctors just made it up
[4:56:56] <+MrATheGreat> On main menu
[4:56:56] <heysamuel> incredible progress today lads
[4:56:58] <%vaderxyz1970> Tomorrow we

[4:57:04] <ShanaEchidna> @a_bald_bro lol I don't think it's possible.... and yet
[4:57:06] <iacus_> good one
[4:57:08] <+mechslayer71> hopefully church tomorrow
[4:57:12] <primaryfire> pat wrote her a station call slip so it's cool that your playthroughs are differing
[4:57:14] <user_naim> Every session is a good session
[4:57:15] <%Gruhunchously> WÖMAN
[4:57:17] <leinadtonu> Good jorb guys!
[4:57:19] <3rdRunner> HARD CORE
[4:57:19] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus I ended up giving her a station call slip, I super fell for her xD logic saying Id be without kim did me in and I failed to arrest her
[4:57:20] <%livlinn> joofbSweat
[4:57:25] <Reveresao> Makes you follow rules to the letter, not taking into account the personal reasons
[4:57:27] <servicesuspension> That hurt
[4:57:28] <seriousink> that was intense. loved it.
[4:57:29] <%AvroEltz> dont worry, IT WILL GET WORSE
[4:57:29] <skyenoz> yeah but no Kim for like 6 in game hours
[4:57:31] <+PkSilent01> I’m interested to see how this go. Because I let her go in my playthrough
[4:57:32] <%SomeAsianDood> It's ok whatever you do. The world will soon fall to the Gloaming
[4:57:33] <Picia000123> I enjoyed this one
[4:57:33] <Esparsenior> Well … Goodbye disco dancer… no more convos from her
[4:57:35] <user_naim> This game doesn’t disappoint
[4:57:35] <elshadow7> Thou hast banished the Devil Wöman, sire.
[4:57:46] <+Jiggisnipe> that's a good liar
[4:57:48] <iacus_> Volition is extremely By The Book
[4:57:57] <andre11dr> Well you did throw her in the hands of the moral intern ,where they will probably wack her for some white collar shit
[4:57:59] <%vaderxyz1970> She was a professional corporate Spy
[4:57:59] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Whey to knot think with your d!ck
[4:58:02] <zanzibarian_hamster> She is an extremely good liar
[4:58:09] <+chiazam> I wrote a Station Call
[4:58:15] <laserbeaming> she does have a deathwish
[4:58:18] <andre11dr> There was a roof there
[4:58:19] <DSD24> Klassje going "Fuck this shit i'm out"
[4:58:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> This decision, on first playthroughs, sounds interesting, but man, giving her the Station Call is objectively the better option.
[4:58:21] <%TheFabledAble> she preys on your sympathy HARDCORE
[4:58:23] <nelsonsaysbooya> The body language was there
[4:58:24] <servicesuspension> That's a bad way to go
[4:58:26] <+ppangboi> tbh I don't really think there is a clear, "right" choice here
[4:58:30] <Chatterbox1991> i let her go, despite playing a Fascist
[4:58:35] <+Jeshk0> i was lenient. 100% compromised
[4:58:36] <laserbeaming> it's not high enough for an instant kill though
[4:58:37] <leinadtonu> She is an amazing manipulator
[4:58:44] <+mechslayer71> I didn't arrest because I figured I could come back to do it later? what is she gonna do, leave? she's in hiding
[4:58:46] <iacus_> station slip sounds like the more humane option
[4:58:49] <servicesuspension> Obviously there's no such thing as a good choice
[4:58:50] <%krispen_wa> wait, doesnt arresting klaasje mean he's not gonna learn about the Return?
[4:58:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:58:54] <%Gruhunchously> When we've washed back the simp juice
[4:58:54] <andre11dr> I let her go because fuck the white collar shit
[4:59:05] <Esparsenior> Remember… ALL YOUR SKILS ARE COMPROMISED
[4:59:05] <%mariothemaio> I let her go because even if she lied and did bad things, she doesn't deserve this
[4:59:08] <resloxxx> @CappuccinoGuil If she doesnt show up she becomes a fugitive, something what already is. You give her a literal run away for free card LUL
[4:59:09] <heysamuel> i've always let her go
[4:59:12] <+chiazam> I couldn't arrest her because I wasn't okay with her being thrown to the Moralintern
[4:59:13] <+Jeshk0> ironically the station slip seems like the "moralist" option
[4:59:14] <%Irridium> I let her go because the fuck do I care about white collar crime? I'm here to solve the murder and she didn't do it.
[4:59:19] <servicesuspension> white collar shit means thousands of jobs. she was just following orders, but then, so were the nazis
[4:59:21] <BlackermanZX> well she didnt jump but shes dead af if the moralintern knows shes under custody
[4:59:21] <Lefteron> She was a profecional spy. Busnesses closed down because of her. People lost their jobs, She couldn't just walk.
[4:59:43] <%krispen_wa> she cant walk, but FUCK the Moralintern
[4:59:50] <%vaderxyz1970> @woolieversus The collectors edition has a very nice Volition statue
[4:59:51] <servicesuspension> solution
[4:59:52] <%whyskeywolfe> The places that scene gets your mind going is a testament to how well written it is.
[4:59:52] <skyenoz> Yeah the return is a very interesting thing
[4:59:54] <mr_magnificent_305> The white collar shit could have been a lie too. If you had high physical stats, they
[5:00:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @resloxxx if you arrest her, you lose an NPC and Kim is gone for the rest of the day, and if you didn't finish the "talk to her alone" quest, you miss out on XP. I hear your point, but like I said, in first playthroughs it's alright, but not arresting her is objectively better.
[5:00:04] <d41caesar> I think your Shivers is high enough that this isn't the last you hear of her.
[5:00:05] <servicesuspension> reform revachol and kill the sunday friend
[5:00:07] <wibbwobbler> Better safe than sorry?
[5:00:08] <%meniscate> FYI @woolieversus White Mourning is known to cause bugs (screen freezing) during a later sidequest. The extra zoom out messes with the framing. You can either forget it or you could mess around with graphics settings until you solve it. It's a pain to do tho and White Mourning is pretty useless too.
[5:00:10] <%krispen_wa> so i let her get a station call because fuck MI
[5:00:11] <heysamuel> either way it's fascinating to see how everything plays out
[5:00:15] <+MrATheGreat> good stream!
[5:00:18] <nelsonsaysbooya> When Volition doubted Kim I def raised my eyebrow
[5:00:18] <+Tuffty> Good stuff
[5:00:20] <andre11dr> Oh yeah the moral intern will probably pull a Weinstein on her
[5:00:41] <%SomeAsianDood> she's gonna get mcaffee'd Kappa
[5:00:50] <Josef_Stryker> Did u mean an Epstein?
[5:00:54] <%Gruhunchously> Ah shit
[5:00:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> She might have done some really REALLY repugnant white collar shit, people don't run away and turn into drugheads because they have a clear conscience and did some mild espionage shit
[5:00:59] <iacus_> remember that ultimately all skills are still facets of your own psyche
[5:01:09] <andre11dr> Oh yeah Epstein
[5:01:21] <Esparsenior> This is why I love the game though …. It creates actual conversations in many aspects of life … love it
[5:01:22] <+Jiggisnipe> it means he was jacking it
[5:01:24] <andre11dr> Said the wrong thing
[5:01:30] <%krispen_wa> fuck weinstein and epstein
[5:01:31] <servicesuspension> we can't know and she won't tell you, should we asumme the best?
[5:01:32] <skyenoz> @cappuccinoguil not to mention the Le Retour
[5:01:37] <ingman112> What's "mild espionage"? Is that like "light treason"?
[5:01:39] <Jolly_Adventurer> This guy's FUCKED
[5:02:08] <%livlinn> grymLove PrideRise grymLove PrideRise grymLove PrideRise grymLove
[5:02:12] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[5:02:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> @skyenoz I don't remember what that is, but yeah, this is a decision that is great on first playthroughs. But it's not balanced with the mechanics and rewards.
[5:02:37] <%vaderxyz1970> How much is left you think 6 or 7 more streams of stuff left?
[5:02:58] <nelsonsaysbooya> Take a long weekend. Those were big videos
[5:03:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> aaayyyyeee
[5:03:27] <servicesuspension> did Motorway South complete?
[5:03:31] <DSD24> Wouldn't that mean your innards go back in the past?
[5:04:00] <iacus_> physiological addiction?
[5:04:04] <%krispen_wa> Reject Pale. let the past die. kill it if you have to
[5:04:14] <skyenoz> @cappuccinoguil I think it might be some book stuff that happens 2 months after the game but it's not yet translated so idk
[5:04:30] <%vaderxyz1970> White suit optional
[5:04:31] <andre11dr> Wait does Kim go away when you arrest her?
[5:04:32] <+fetrigon> majinoSkiip majinoZulu1 majinoZulu2
[5:04:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> @andre11dr yes
[5:04:46] <%krispen_wa> yeah he leaves. so a full day of nothing
[5:04:53] <%meniscate> Chemical "hooks" are real tho
[5:04:54] <andre11dr> Ok i guess next stream is Kimless
[5:04:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> Next stream is gonna be a long time of kimless
[5:05:23] <%Lion_kun> I would kill a day and get Kim back.
[5:05:40] <ManlyMcBeefington> time to read book
[5:05:41] <%Lion_kun> I would definitely not do the church quests without Kim
[5:05:44] <andre11dr> He dose have like 4 books
[5:05:59] <+Jeshk0> it certainly aint a game about easy choices
[5:05:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:06:06] <andre11dr> And he can do the church without Kim
[5:06:07] <%Lion_kun> Or you'd miss out on the best scene in the game
[5:06:28] <%meniscate> FYI @woolieversus White Mourning is known to cause bugs (screen freezing) during a later sidequest. The extra zoom out messes with the framing. You can either forget it or you could mess around with graphics settings until you solve it. It's a pain to do tho and White Mourning is pretty useless too.
[5:06:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'd give her the Slip. Arresting her only puts a person's live on the line, according to her story. She's been in town for months just fucking herself up.
[5:06:32] <%Lion_kun> Doing the church without Kim means missing out on THAT scene.
[5:06:41] <%jinking79> she almost left like THawk actor from the SF movie
[5:06:43] <andre11dr> Oh right that shit
[5:06:49] <%krispen_wa> volition is just as compromised
[5:06:54] <%vaderxyz1970> @lion_kun there's still tomorrow
[5:06:57] <+Jeshk0> The End is always Nigh
[5:06:59] <servicesuspension> The Paledriver was awesome
[5:07:00] <BlackermanZX> volition was the most compromised of em all
[5:07:05] <%Gruhunchously> Just don't go to the church without Kim
[5:07:05] <%krispen_wa> Trust only Shivers
[5:07:16] <wibbwobbler> Police gotta police
[5:07:23] <%Lion_kun> The Shivers check scene.
[5:07:24] <%livlinn> forgottenLiger forgottenLiger forgottenLiger
[5:07:24] <andre11dr> Actually yeah the world is ending in 3 years anyway so fuck it
[5:07:24] <%MightyDuckShoes> My feelings on that choice when I first got it was...The fork in the road was letting her go with a technicality. in the end the only reason for that option is for someone who doesn't want to arrest her...but wants to feel like they did their job.
[5:08:06] <iacus_> Obviously the citation is another way of letting her go. There's no way she would have respected it when she's already on the run
[5:08:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh 1985 is the limit? LUL
[5:08:16] <+Jeshk0> thats the cutoff?
[5:08:29] <%MichaelDood> woolieYE
[5:08:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hey man, you can experience the Dreamcast again
[5:08:42] <andre11dr> 1985 my favorite Freddy Gibbs song
[5:08:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> What about Middle Ages, though? Kappa
[5:08:48] <servicesuspension> The world started when I invented solipsism
[5:08:49] <$eco419> LUL
[5:09:00] <iacus_> ahaha I get it
[5:09:00] <%whyskeywolfe> I'm Irish. Forward is good for me.
[5:09:02] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @justcallmebobplease
[5:09:03] <servicesuspension> I'd just loop the last 3 decades
[5:09:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> did you know what you're describing is the plot of an episode of Legends of Tomorrow?
[5:09:07] <+Jeshk0> ive got the time travel hallpass
[5:09:09] <%MichaelDood> Ugh, I don't wanna see feathered dinosaurs.
[5:09:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Black guy time travels to the Civil War in the US LUL
[5:09:20] <funnyfunnykid> Gonna show Napoleon Tekken 3 on his death bed
