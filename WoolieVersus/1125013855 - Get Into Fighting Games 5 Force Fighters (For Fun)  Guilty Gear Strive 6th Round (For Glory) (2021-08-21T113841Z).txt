[0:03:05] <+ManOfReason> ITBT ITBT ITBT
[0:03:25] <leith_aziz> We aint complaining
[0:03:40] <@Solidus_113> I wish I had that same drive to grind out strive and get better at it
[0:03:41] <%invalid_robin> I love the strive streams lol
[0:03:45] <Applecannon63> 5 forces baby~
[0:03:48] <lazerscraper> BROTHERS WE RISE
[0:03:59] <kotl7> @leith_aziz I AM! I was in the middle of watching last episode on youtube, it goes too fast!
[0:04:02] <Bonebagmel> CHURN THAT BUTTER BABY
[0:04:02] <leith_aziz> Been messing with Chipp now that I reached Lv.100 with Sol. Triple overhead is so cheap I love it
[0:04:05] <%Irridium> spin to fuckin win baby
[0:04:06] <blackkanye> In this Behemoth Typhoon woolie plays Nago
[0:04:12] <%invalid_robin> in this Behemoth Typhoon
[0:04:14] <@Solidus_113> in this behemoth typhoon, you CHURN THE BUTTER
[0:04:17] <%Juriasu> 63214H41236H
[0:04:21] <blackkanye> In this Behemoth Typhoon. Reggie plays Milia
[0:04:22] <@Solidus_113> NEVER STOP CHURNING
[0:04:26] <leith_aziz> In This Behemoth Typhoon, Goldlewis will make you regret playing the game
[0:04:33] <+loukemia83> Gotta Give em the Gold Dick
[0:04:34] <NotHereToStream> GoldChad Lewison
[0:04:38] <lazerscraper> in this Behemoth Typhoon, he swings his COCK
[0:04:38] <Bonebagmel> "I'm gonna spin this stick, and hit a button; whatever happens next is between you and god"
[0:04:43] <%jinking79> 1080
[0:04:45] <leith_aziz> I didnt understand the super thing
[0:04:49] <blackkanye> I do wonder
[0:04:50] <@Solidus_113> it's a 720 max
[0:04:56] <blackkanye> because of the high half circles
[0:04:58] <Bonebagmel> I think is during the animation
[0:05:01] <%Juriasu> I think there is some confusion, but I think yeah 720 is max
[0:05:02] <Applecannon63> Super is 2 Full Circle Motions?
[0:05:20] <leith_aziz> 3 half circles or full circles?
[0:05:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though, having a character with so many half circles is gonna be difficult since half circles are so tight in strive NotLikeThis
[0:05:33] <kotl7> 1080 typhoonboarding 64
[0:05:35] <%Juriasu> normal variant is half cirlce foward input and next two are 1 or 2 full cirlces
[0:05:41] <lazerscraper> Security level???
[0:05:42] <%KetsuoTaberu> Spin to win
[0:05:42] <leith_aziz> I can just swing 63214 three times and I get the super, right?
[0:05:47] <CyrusVGZ> Goldlewis gotta stay in the DLC box. I'm not here for those inputs lol.
[0:05:47] <leith_aziz> Burn it Down!
[0:05:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Ooo ah ah ah ah
[0:05:57] <+StrikeTheErf> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ the thing that always got me at first (and a lot of people) is you just need to make sure to hit 4 and/or 6 cleanly
[0:05:59] <leith_aziz> Gonna love spamming that Hammer of Dawn super
[0:06:03] <@Solidus_113> Battle Fantasia

[0:06:20] <blackkanye> Chadha LUL
[0:06:21] <Applecannon63> Man I hope we see Area 51 buddy as command normals
[0:06:26] <Necrololicon_> waldstein lite
[0:06:27] <%Irridium> bring back the pentagram
[0:06:39] <blackkanye> Oh god there is a pentagram super in arcana heart
[0:06:45] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 6P looked like one of them. It also liked like the Alien hands out the Minigun
[0:06:47] <leith_aziz> Love it
[0:06:48] <+loukemia83> Hit box makes 360s harder because of the Up button placement
[0:06:56] <@Solidus_113> pentagram also in Super DBZ for Piccolo
[0:07:02] <%Juriasu> monkaS
[0:07:04] <%KetsuoTaberu> LUL
[0:07:13] <leith_aziz> Pad player here. Wont affect
[0:07:17] <+TopTieramisu> the anti-hitbox character
[0:07:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @StrikeTheErf yeeah, as long as you hit the non-in betweens good it seems fine, but still, gotta churn
[0:07:28] <Applecannon63> Hitbox mains can find a way
[0:07:50] <%KetsuoTaberu> now try it on a DDR mat
[0:08:03] <leith_aziz> I like the idea of the input with the coffin
[0:08:13] <kotl7> it's cool to see new inputs that make sense
[0:08:15] <%Juriasu> I think he is really creativley designed
[0:08:15] <+loukemia83> It's got real Fight Night vibes
[0:08:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[0:08:19] <Applecannon63> Piano the Coffin
[0:08:25] <@Solidus_113> I wanted more alien moves
[0:08:30] <@Solidus_113> it's like Gio Dog 2.0
[0:08:59] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 I saw the Alien do more IMO. He hands outt the weapons, he attacks in a jump attack and the 6P
[0:09:05] <Applecannon63> Alien will definitly be involved in Normals/Command Normals so = Paranormals?
[0:09:17] <iacus_> what about headbutts?
[0:09:18] <leith_aziz> He's already giving Rei run for her money
[0:09:32] <Applecannon63> hell the alien basically Gold's jab
[0:10:01] <NotHereToStream> weird he has no command grab
[0:10:10] <@Solidus_113> which is the low, which is the overhead, that's it
[0:10:19] <@Solidus_113> also he can actually dash
[0:10:26] <leith_aziz> I find it interesting that he has no command grab but at the same time he can airdash
[0:10:27] <kotl7> @NotHereToStream doesn't he have a command running grab?
[0:10:28] <357Sneak> yeheyey Steve Fox's X n O buttons are for his spine as opposed to his legs notkohLUL
[0:10:34] <leith_aziz> his mobility is so interesting
[0:10:35] <DSD24> Yoooo Gundam Wing
[0:10:38] <NotHereToStream> @kotl7 unfortunately no
[0:10:42] <leith_aziz> with how it mixes with his moveset
[0:10:47] <DSD24> Lets review G Gundam and talk about how hype it is
[0:10:52] <kotl7> oh ok it looked like one
[0:11:02] <%vaderxyz1970> Ying Yui is a sociopath
[0:11:27] <DSD24> Epyon is the best
[0:11:37] <%Juriasu> just send essays as donation messages I guess
[0:11:45] <%vaderxyz1970> Talgesse is my favorite
[0:11:48] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz so basicially Bob with a mix of Birdie
[0:11:54] <%Sparkseid> lol
[0:11:54] <leith_aziz> Dammit, I need to remeber Dio's actor. It doesnt feel right to refer to him as "Dio"
[0:12:02] <Blank9> wing sucks
[0:12:03] <leith_aziz> What's the actor's name
[0:12:03] <blackkanye> This is Gundam Wing's stream now
[0:12:11] <Applecannon63> but doesn't have a birdie chain grab
[0:12:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> Like 00
[0:12:32] <leith_aziz> What would you recommend?
[0:12:37] <+StrikeTheErf> it's non-minmaxed time
[0:12:37] <+StrawberryPantsu> Or reading the Novels
[0:12:40] <%HRDSalami654> Like
[0:12:40] <Blank9> Stardust Memory is short and good
[0:12:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the next time woolie streams something gundam related I'll be disappointed if we don't get an obama-esque 40 page essay tbh
[0:12:42] <%asakura_ayase> Gundam woolieGIRLS
[0:12:43] <+loukemia83> G Gundam is the best

[0:18:06] <wqorst> bump? woolie got gamer thumb?
[0:18:08] <%Sparkseid> Y E S
[0:18:13] <Bonebagmel> yep
[0:18:25] <NotHereToStream> now imagine goldlewis on stick
[0:18:26] <leith_aziz> My hands hurt more when I play Chipp
[0:18:31] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> nago feeds on carpal tunnels

[0:18:39] <%asakura_ayase> Choose the form of your destroyer
[0:18:40] <passserby> Woolie Vs Hitbox
[0:18:43] <%Juriasu> Woolie needs a hitbox is what I'm hearing
[0:18:44] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> someone in TFH EVO top 8 is playing the the Shout of Sea skin. :o
[0:18:48] <%vaderxyz1970> is it too late to remap to a more comfortable set up?
[0:18:57] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> the spirit of Woolie is strong.
[0:19:16] <%Sparkseid> I chose wrist
[0:19:19] <+loukemia83> I got myself some wrist braces, and have not had issues with the hitbox
[0:19:30] <+loukemia83> old man wrists are a real issue
[0:19:45] <Applecannon63> thumb is for stink
[0:20:15] <leith_aziz> I'd say Nago, Sol and Chipp make your hands hurt the most. Nago and Chipp with the special inputs and how often you use them and Sol with how much you press
[0:20:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> Has @WoolieVersus Tried a hitbox?
[0:20:53] <gyrobasel> remove motion inputs from fighting games, save your wrists Kappa
[0:20:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> ^
[0:20:58] <+loukemia83> it's not hard, it's repetitive stress
[0:21:16] <%slayabee> !glossary rekka
[0:21:23] <leith_aziz> Basically me with Chipp. Alpha blade, Rekkas, DP etc
[0:21:32] <%Irridium> @gyrobasel I miss Rising Thunder
[0:21:58] <gyrobasel> @Irridium fantasy strike has no motion inputs either but the game is just boring unfortunately
[0:22:02] <CyrusVGZ> Equivalent Exchange
[0:22:02] <DSD24> This is some Soul Sacrifice shit
[0:22:21] <gyrobasel> i really curious to see if riot will implement motion inputs for their fighting game
[0:22:25] <DSD24> Sacrifice your hands for more time on the clock
[0:22:30] <eelwoman> The plight of the Nago main.

[0:26:20] <Applecannon63> KoF?
[0:26:35] <Applecannon63> in terms of movemenr
[0:27:23] <%LordSDB> Nothing wrong with block for a button. Plus its using it to add more to the gameplay
[0:27:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:27:42] <Zeif00> Ok that's an aura on Pebbles, was fuckin me up
[0:28:33] <%Juriasu> @Zeif00 ahhh, yeah I thought he was a paper cutout or something

[0:44:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> we do it
[0:44:58] <+TopTieramisu> too hype to continue
[0:45:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you were stylin too hard
[0:45:05] <Sadnehs> Is this in a game engine or like... from scratch
[0:45:07] <Dave_VD> This game looks actually sick though
[0:45:11] <emptyantics> ZANWARUDO
[0:45:14] <Applecannon63> welp
[0:45:16] <Applecannon63> QA
[0:45:28] <%townzzzzz> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:45:31] <+RoniusAdethel> So, is that what a frame trap is?
[0:45:31] <andre11dr> Nah they moving so fast you can't see it
[0:45:41] <Dave_VD> But imma need more than five characters
[0:45:42] <ZeeJiggle> My sketches are still on that desk, I'm sure.
[0:45:45] <Explodincatz> u will never escape broken balls
[0:45:57] <andre11dr> Oh it's just 5 caracters
[0:45:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:46:01] <andre11dr> i see
[0:46:01] <+TopTieramisu> his glove is so baaad
[0:46:04] <iacus_> OC
[0:46:09] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[0:46:13] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[0:46:18] <+ItsRatman> Damn what a glove
[0:46:29] <Applecannon63> Oh god the power glove
[0:46:30] <Sadnehs> I wanna imagine a fighting game where all the characters have like zero visual design. Practically hit boxes lol
[0:46:50] <+manic_raven> @Sadnehs so nidhogg?
[0:47:00] <+TopTieramisu> not nidhogg 2
[0:47:08] <+TopTieramisu> nidhogg 2 is designed to be hideous
[0:47:16] <Meltgar> wasn't there a game that the characters looked like squared boxes? Love something?
[0:47:23] <andre11dr> Nidhogg 2 never happened
[0:47:28] <%Juriasu> da black goku ah yes
[0:47:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> tough love arena?
[0:47:29] <+Xero_J> Tough Love Arena?
[0:47:34] <%Sparkseid> Reggie doesnt know!?
[0:47:38] <+FuqBoiSlim> @xero_j arena-mind
[0:47:38] <NotHereToStream> BBG, big black goku
[0:47:41] <Meltgar> @FuqBoiSlim @Xero_J I think it was
[0:47:42] <%TheotherKristian> What's Nidhogg 2? lol
[0:47:44] <Applecannon63> Ah Matt
[0:48:11] <emptyantics> Realizing Matt used to make those gangsta DBZ characters so long ago LUL
[0:48:13] <Meltgar> @TheotherKristian Huh, why did Nidhogg 2 fail? nighto35Hmm
[0:48:30] <Applecannon63> Visually its mixed a bag
[0:48:34] <mephium> all the timelines and multiverses NotLikeThis
[0:48:42] <+FuqBoiSlim> @emptyantics Matt's deviantart page is some ancient lore
[0:48:52] <+loukemia83> Nidhogg 2 failed because you cannot improve on perfection
[0:49:04] <andre11dr> It could've
[0:49:16] <emptyantics> @fuqboislim” It belongs in a museum!”
[0:49:16] <andre11dr> But it decided to just look ugly
[0:49:35] <andre11dr> Because "it's unique you see"
[0:49:36] <Meltgar> Ahhh visually it looks terrible?
[0:49:46] <Meltgar> I was wondering the SUDDEN CHANGE of design
[0:50:15] <andre11dr> Yeah, i don't know why they didn't just make it look like the first one ,i think the first one looks great
[0:50:16] <+TopTieramisu> nidhogg 2's art direction is baffling
[0:50:17] <Sadnehs> @Sadnehs I'm thinking more like Antistatic lol
[0:50:30] <DSD24> if Nidhogg went for a 16 bit aesthetic instead of what it was I bet people would have liked it if they had to change the art style
[0:50:40] <PFlare> Whoa. This game seems cool.
[0:50:42] <BackwardCap> gildedNut
[0:50:57] <%slayabee> The schmovement
[0:51:00] <PFlare> New indie game? Looks fluid.
[0:51:14] <DSD24> Pebbles seems top tier
[0:51:30] <PFlare> Are these two twins?
[0:51:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:35] <+manic_raven> there's also hyper hitboxing
[0:51:37] <Applecannon63> this game already has a bew character in development
[0:51:42] <PFlare> I get Boondocks vibes from both of them.
[0:51:45] <andre11dr> Nidhogg 2 had that Donte energy where i was like, why would you change it INTO THIS
[0:51:49] <+TopTieramisu> yo that building in the background is wayyyy too big
[0:51:50] <castcola> @Sadnehs I swear there was a version of Melee where it was just the character's hitboxes listed as archtypes of each playstyle.
[0:52:11] <+Breeazy4547> S/O to Kaizen Creed
[0:52:14] <castcola> floating character, sword character, space character.
[0:52:17] <DSD24> @castcola Didn't Woolie play a game like that called Foozies?
[0:52:35] <DSD24> Where it was just hitboxes and neutral
[0:52:54] <+TopTieramisu> divekick is just neutral
[0:53:03] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, that night they did with YOVG
[0:53:33] <andre11dr> They played that jank footzis game
[0:53:37] <Meltgar> Somehow the lifebars at the end look tricky because you don't know how much HP is left
[0:53:39] <PFlare> I dunno if I like the chill music for this, but it has potential.
[0:53:56] <+TopTieramisu> it does seem like an odd choice for music
[0:53:59] <PFlare> Wild question- do you know what this was made in? I have my suspicions.
[0:54:24] <PFlare> This setup so far kinda screams Fighter Maker 2K to me, but I might be biased.
[0:54:50] <+Breeazy4547> This fighting game got backed in the matter of a few days can't wait till the full release
[0:54:51] <+TopTieramisu> true infinite?
[0:54:54] <andre11dr> It's a game about blackness, jazz makes sense
[0:54:55] <%Stonesoul_> uh oh
[0:55:32] <+TopTieramisu> probably limit the amount of wall bounces in a combo
[0:55:35] <andre11dr> Granted it could've been some more aggresive or fast jazz but it works
[0:55:56] <PFlare> @andre11dr I mean, it doesn't feel jazzy to me, either. Jazz would be cool, but this is just kinda...chill. Also if you want something related to blackness, rock and roll is just as valid.
[0:56:19] <roz_en> Okay, I just tuned in and WOAH this looks hot
[0:56:20] <+loukemia83> cocain jazz would be a better mode setter, the music is a little too laid back on this stage
[0:56:22] <PFlare> WELP
[0:56:24] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[0:56:26] <andre11dr> Some jazz is just chill tho
[0:56:30] <%Deft_Thought> Y'all wanna see an INFINITE??
[0:56:43] <+TopTieramisu> he teched it?
[0:56:56] <PMda2nd> I think so
[0:56:57] <PFlare> @andre11dr Yeah, and there's nothing wrong with chill jazz, but I just don't think it fits for a fast paced game like I'm seeing. It needs something more Skullgirls-ish, IMO.
[0:56:59] <WakeUpThrow> Music makes me think this is the game's training stage
[0:57:01] <andre11dr> I mean i would've love some The Comet is Coming type of jazz but it's fine
[0:57:18] <+MTLxSpider> fair and honest
[0:57:22] <PFlare> Did they get like, a key or an early build of it specially?
[0:57:22] <sigspam> skullgirls also has some more chill tracks
[0:57:40] <sigspam> but i do agree that this game's soundtrack might be a bit too chill
[0:57:42] <objektivespieleanalyse> chill music makes the sets feel very peaceful, I get what they're going for
[0:57:45] <PFlare> @sigspam Very true. However it's still more intense due to the instrument choice and bps.
[0:57:54] <sigspam> these beats are still cool though
[0:58:04] <sigspam> yeah yeah
[0:58:18] <+1bigwayne> @pflare you can download the demo from their Kickstarter page
[0:58:27] <Meltgar> Oh yeah chat, how's the thought of music WITH VOCALS?
[0:58:28] <PFlare> This is all a very long-winded way of saying WHERE'S THE BASS, really.
[0:58:32] <Meltgar> Since GG strive has them
[0:58:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:35] <sigspam> lmao yeah
[0:58:46] <+TopTieramisu> @Meltgar 3 words: tuna with bacon
[0:58:57] <andre11dr> Honestly it kinda makes me think of the first MF DOOM album to be honest
[0:59:00] <Meltgar> nighto35Hmm
[0:59:01] <PFlare> Oh, they'er Kickstarting?
[0:59:07] <sigspam> music with vocals is fine, though i am curious why people don't like em
[0:59:10] <+1bigwayne> yee
[0:59:21] <PFlare> Like, I just got in like 3-5 minutes ago so I dunno anything about this game.
[0:59:23] <%Sparkseid> to da moon
[0:59:25] <%townzzzzz> high rise
[0:59:29] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:59:33] <Meltgar> INFINTITE?!?!
[0:59:34] <leith_aziz> I love music with vocals. I jive with all Strive songs
[0:59:38] <+TopTieramisu> lightning loops
[0:59:38] <PFlare> That is ABSOLUTELY an infinite.
[0:59:47] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> don't drop that shit motherfucker! LUL
[0:59:54] <@Menitta> lmaooo
[0:59:58] <sigspam> KEEP THE RHYTHM UP
[0:59:58] <PMda2nd> sheesh
[0:59:59] <brexdq> this looks pretty cool not ganna lie
[1:00:06] <andre11dr> There's a bunch of music without vocals that i love tho
[1:00:18] <sigspam> see this track is already faster
[1:00:19] <PFlare> Ah, now see, this music is a bit more like it.
[1:00:22] <leith_aziz> Dont know if they're my favorite, but they can be very expressive and give you and idea of the characters themselves if its a character song
[1:00:42] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, this track is better for sure
[1:00:47] <leith_aziz> But I get if one personally dont jive with vocals songs
[1:00:51] <sigspam> that's why i love strive's music, lends itself more to storytelling n character arcs
[1:00:52] <BackwardCap> sajamInfinite
[1:01:01] <PFlare> Oh, okay.
[1:01:02] <+TopTieramisu> the window is way too forgiving too
[1:01:02] <Meltgar> @leith_aziz True, although i'm fine with some songs like in GGX2 where on the songs you could FEEL the character
[1:01:11] <leith_aziz> @sigspam Zato's theme in a nutshell
[1:01:12] <Meltgar> Vocals give them more lore when you hear them
[1:01:14] <sigspam> i love x2's ost
[1:01:31] <Meltgar> Justice's theme and Final boss i-no is a JAM
[1:01:31] <andre11dr> The worst is when a song with vocals is mixed bad with the game
[1:01:51] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar You mean like that one bit in Venom's theme? sure. I think Millia's XX theme worked really well for how she was at that point
[1:01:52] <sigspam> i personally like x2's more than strive, especially with its unique matchup themes
[1:02:02] <+loukemia83> Getting out of it does take meter it looks like

[1:02:10] <MysteryFish_> poyo
[1:02:42] <leith_aziz> For some reason, I dont end up wanting to listen to XX songs too much. Maybe I''ve heard them too often. I end up listening to Xrd or Strive OST for some reason

[1:02:53] <leith_aziz> lol
[1:03:03] <Meltgar> It's fair, you find NEW music therefore your brain is interested more in the new jams
[1:03:06] <sigspam> xrd ost is pretty good too
[1:03:08] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @1bigwayne
[1:03:20] <+1bigwayne> whoops
[1:03:26] <Meltgar> It's like hearing the same song for 50 times and finally you can say "Yeah, i'm alright with this song"
[1:03:38] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar Could be
[1:03:41] <@Menitta> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kaizen-creed/5-force-fighters-0 Here's the kickstarter
[1:03:46] <PFlare> Ah, thank you.
[1:03:49] <andre11dr> Xrd haa great tracks but i kinda like the XX tracks better
[1:04:02] <sigspam> i dunno why i'm even talkin about FG ost, i just put music on in the background on my pc lol
[1:04:05] <+1bigwayne> thx
[1:04:12] <sigspam> though i do listen to a lotta gear
[1:04:18] <PFlare> ...20k for a fighting game?
[1:04:26] <Meltgar> That's some things that GG missed because we didn't hear the themes of characters that weren't added on REV 2
[1:04:30] <leith_aziz> If you listen to Xrd songs too much, they can end up feeling samey alltogether. I think XX is more varied but I jive with it less
[1:04:35] <andre11dr> They are rougher, Xrd songs are clean
[1:04:36] <MysteryFish_> @Meltgar guilty gear stockholm syndrome boupheGood
[1:04:37] <Meltgar> Imagine the songs Bridget, Testament would have gotten
[1:04:44] <TheArrow_> the great thing about guilty gear music is it's all good
[1:05:00] <leith_aziz> @TheArrow_ 100% (Holy Order? excluded)
[1:05:02] <sigspam> @Meltgar also no KYA 2, only 3
[1:05:05] <ZeromusPrime93> He probably won't see this but; Hey Woolie, big fan since the SBF days, recently made a twitch account and finally checking out the livestreams
[1:05:13] <PFlare> ...Hm.
[1:05:27] <gyrobasel> strive ost is a big meh compared to previous entires
[1:05:27] <andre11dr> As that being said Sin song goes way harder than it should
[1:05:29] <MysteryFish_> MysteryFish_ gifted a Tier 1 sub to ZeromusPrime93! 
[1:05:35] <PFlare> The game's flow looks good. The kickstarter is well made, in terms of layout.
[1:05:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[1:05:50] <sigspam> @andre11dr you think his xrd theme is good? listen to his overture track
[1:05:51] <leith_aziz> The loops
[1:05:51] <PFlare> But they're expecting to get this game out in 2022 on 20k? Thaaaaat's suspect.
[1:05:53] <Meltgar> Funny enough i liked Izuna's theme, even though the game were he was in was .... ehhhh?
[1:06:01] <%ZeromusPrime93> Oh damn, thanks man
[1:06:27] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar To be fair, Overture OST is banger. Diva, KYA3, Re-coming, The Mask Does Not Laugh
[1:06:27] <PFlare> Even with only 5 characters, with all those features they're planning, I don't see that happening.
[1:06:46] <sigspam> @Meltgar fuck yeah
[1:06:50] <andre11dr> either way it very clearl what Daisukes influences are
[1:06:58] <Meltgar> @leith_aziz That's one thing i missed, didn't managed to listen YET the XRD album or full Rev 2
[1:07:12] <Meltgar> Aside from the limited edition disc
[1:07:12] <andre11dr> Let's of heavy metal and a little of trash metal
[1:07:26] <%ZeromusPrime93> These juggles...
[1:07:28] <sigspam> @PFlare i dunno enough about game dev yet to comment on that, but if it's as hard as you say, i wish them good luck lol
[1:07:44] <Meltgar> GAME BROKEN?!
[1:07:45] <leith_aziz> I cant speak on Genre but I love how varied the Strive songs are genre and compissition wise
[1:07:47] <Meltgar> LUL
[1:07:55] <andre11dr> Again
[1:08:01] <sigspam> @leith_aziz absolutely
[1:08:08] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar Check on Spotify
[1:08:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> beautifully artistic shot of the wall there
[1:08:13] <andre11dr> Woolie why do you keep breaking these games
[1:08:34] <PFlare> @sigspam I've both ran a Kickstarter before and actually done development on a fighting game. It is incredibly difficult, especially seeing as they're doing what looks like handdrawn 2D.
[1:08:34] <andre11dr> It's somehow totally his fault
[1:09:12] <TigerClaws12> romollaJam
[1:09:12] <PFlare> This is a 2023 game at the absolute minimum- I personally would say 2024 if it's finished at all.
[1:09:16] <%WafferThin> WafferThin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hype
[1:09:26] <PFlare> That asking price is just too low.
[1:09:39] <PFlare> But! It WAS funded, so it'll be interesting to see how far they get.
[1:09:54] <andre11dr> Is it aiming for 5 caracters?
[1:10:03] <PFlare> They might be able to do something after all.
[1:10:07] <PFlare> Yup.
[1:10:24] <PFlare> 5 characters, which is small, sure, but that'll still take quite a while.
[1:10:41] <%ZeromusPrime93> Bruh, this is newgrounds flash fighting game level stuff
[1:10:43] <PFlare> And these two characters aren't finished...I'm pretty sure.
[1:10:46] <Meltgar> True that.. Skullgirls took what again with all the DLC characters?
[1:10:47] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Did Aaron McGruder make a fights?
[1:10:53] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> *fighter
[1:11:01] <PFlare> @Meltgar 6 digit prices per character.
[1:11:07] <+TopTieramisu> smash is like the opposite of auto-correct lol
[1:11:15] <+TopTieramisu> except for some of the characters from other fighting games
[1:11:31] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Ooh, with the LONG t-shirt
[1:12:25] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Has Woolie ever made fun of someone for not wearing a shirt, you guys?
[1:12:36] <andre11dr> What
[1:12:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:47] <Meltgar> He always likes when people fight on top of buildings, shirtless and on the rain Kappa
[1:12:48] <PFlare> Like, this is a GOOD Proof of Concept, I think. If they get this in front of the right eyes they could maybe find a sponsor or indie publisher willing to back them.
[1:12:52] <andre11dr> Like in real life
[1:12:57] <+1bigwayne> Reggie mashin
[1:13:04] <%ZeromusPrime93> What IS this game, man...
[1:13:06] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Ok cool, I ain't wearing a shirt right now.
[1:13:44] <andre11dr> I mean neither am i ,it's hot as fuck

[1:17:37] <Equirah> thanks woolie o/
[1:17:59] <andre11dr> Ok this commentary tho LUL
[1:18:23] <%slayabee> Okay I love this game
[1:18:24] <%ZeromusPrime93> So...BURST?
[1:18:29] <+TopTieramisu> when taking damage? it's more like burst
[1:19:04] <%ZeromusPrime93> V shift
[1:19:52] <%Sparkseid> ayyye
[1:19:52] <Deko_> rollback PogChamp
[1:19:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:57] <+TopTieramisu> yo rollback?
[1:19:58] <andre11dr> Could've watched this BEFORE playing the game, but would make to much sense
[1:20:32] <%ZeromusPrime93> Oh my god, it has better netcode than Tekken
[1:20:43] <Meltgar> Tekken move aside, this game has ROLLBACK Kappa
[1:21:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >anime like cut-scenes. Fam they will die animating this
[1:21:11] <andre11dr> Ok now what
[1:21:24] <357Sneak> zoneAYAYA FBCatch FBCatch FBCatch
[1:21:26] <andre11dr> More GG?
[1:21:41] <+pupil31> Thicc drum
[1:21:44] <%he1lhydra> THICC
[1:21:49] <%ZeromusPrime93> Yeah, so....2024? At the earliesy
[1:22:00] <Meltgar> Thinking about it, has there been ANY fighting game character that uses a drum?
[1:22:03] <Meltgar> My brain can't remember
[1:22:04] <+TopTieramisu> flats are the secret top tier
[1:22:10] <iacus_> of what?
[1:22:13] <andre11dr> I like flats
[1:22:21] <leith_aziz> @Meltgar There's Big Band, but does he count?
[1:22:24] <+TopTieramisu> remove that one bone and you got a meatier drum
[1:22:28] <Demoli_PT> did you end up watching the olympics opening woolie?
[1:22:34] <Meltgar> @Meltgar Actually you know what? Super fair
[1:22:40] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[1:22:47] <357Sneak> for Drums
[1:22:52] <+pupil31> S T R I V E
[1:22:54] <+TopTieramisu> strive
[1:22:56] <iacus_> Big Band is best skullgirl
[1:23:03] <andre11dr> Uhh ,do i really gotta but up my pc
[1:23:07] <Pt_Kamen> still no goldlewis...
[1:23:14] <%Exiliator> donkey kong?
[1:23:17] <+OrangeMDT> Love that strive is the go to
[1:23:18] <andre11dr> I'm just going to press far S
[1:23:23] <andre11dr> Fuck it
[1:23:25] <leith_aziz> Out of topic, I just listened to Faust's theme again. That last 2 minutes of that song might be the best part of the OST
[1:23:31] <%ZeromusPrime93> C O N N E C T I N G TO N E T W O RK
[1:23:32] <leith_aziz> So good
[1:23:40] <%baka_sugoi> GEAR
[1:23:48] <Meltgar> 20 Minutes of CONNECTING TO NETWORK Kappa
[1:23:55] <@Solidus_113> Server got hands
[1:24:02] <Pt_Kamen> 134 times
[1:24:06] <+loukemia83> that would explain why it takes FOR FUCK EVER
[1:24:08] <TigerClaws12> 127 http requests to Japan
[1:24:08] <leith_aziz> In short, the closer you are to Japan, the less time ot takes
[1:24:10] <Equirah> not apparently, straight up is
[1:24:13] <%Irridium> everyone in the world who logs on too sent to this one server
[1:24:19] <leith_aziz> Confirmation?
[1:24:33] <andre11dr> Wait what, there's no US server
[1:24:35] <leith_aziz> I legit dont know, but yes. It's faster in Japan
[1:24:35] <Equirah> it does it to download jsons with grabage data
[1:24:40] <iacus_> is that 134 retries? or 134 calls
[1:24:40] <+RenoDeGeneric> It does. JP Streamers get up and running real fast
[1:24:40] <Meltgar> Don't think there's an US yet
[1:24:48] <Pt_Kamen> They need to know if you are in Brazil with one of those lag switches
[1:24:50] <TigerClaws12> they have AWS nodes around the world but the start up is specifically pinging a Japan node
[1:24:57] <dellis80> NotLikeThis Japan, don't be like this, there's enough countries doing this
[1:25:00] <@Solidus_113> you can do that here, but you have to have steam in offline mode
[1:25:02] <@Menitta> brb just gonna speedrun Mario 64 before the server connects
[1:25:17] <TigerClaws12> time to speedrun castlevania romollaGuck
[1:25:18] <leith_aziz> @Menitta People can also beat a Dark Souls boss
[1:25:20] <@Solidus_113> helps for testing mods
[1:25:20] <Pt_Kamen> lag switch is stupid weird tech
[1:25:21] <andre11dr> Japan will always be like this
[1:25:28] <Meltgar> @Solidus_113 Steam it? lytSMUG /jk
[1:25:35] <%ZeromusPrime93> I was in Japan for work 3 weeks ago, connection speed is still terrible over there
[1:25:39] <Equirah> YOu can create a network rule for strive and have it off on start-up and switch it on when you select network mode
[1:25:44] <Godclear> Is this an ASMR stream?
[1:25:48] <Godclear> Cause it sounds like it
[1:25:52] <@Menitta> I need to get this on PC at some point
[1:25:55] <+balouie> are they playing on pc or ps5?
[1:25:57] <@Menitta> PC
[1:26:02] <TigerClaws12> gloved gamer romollaFear
[1:26:02] <Meltgar> Probably PC
[1:26:04] <leith_aziz> PC
[1:26:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the glove wasn't strong enough to contain THE WOOLIE
[1:26:10] <leith_aziz> Good choice
[1:26:22] <Godclear> Why pc?
[1:26:25] <leith_aziz> Got that Woolie mod myself
[1:26:26] <Godclear> What’s the prob?
[1:26:28] <TigerClaws12> less input lag
[1:26:33] <Equirah> @Godclear best version of the game
[1:26:43] <@Menitta> Oh yeah there's input lag
[1:26:44] <@Solidus_113> if you want a list I can send you a bunch of good ones
[1:26:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> there's some really good ones
[1:26:46] <leith_aziz> @Godclear Less input lag, biggest playerbase outside of crossplay, most connnections are wired, etc
[1:26:48] <Deko_> shirtless nago looks sick
[1:26:48] <andre11dr> I only have it on PC
[1:26:48] <+loukemia83> @godclear 1 frame of lag vs 5 on PS
[1:26:48] <@Menitta> Forgot about that
[1:27:07] <%ZeromusPrime93> Nagoriwoolie
[1:27:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:27:08] <+balouie> wow that seems like a major difference
[1:27:13] <Godclear> Wow. Shit. Ps sounds pretty bad
[1:27:15] <Godclear> Yikes
[1:27:18] <%Exiliator> woolieKICKDAD woolieSPICE
[1:27:20] <TigerClaws12> Punk inflating the list LUL
[1:27:30] <andre11dr> I'll deal with the 5 frames of lag that's still 2 less than SF5 LUL
[1:27:35] <leith_aziz> Zato did win some tourneis
[1:27:36] <Brandon__Brando> oh no more axl
[1:27:48] <+TopTieramisu> i'm usually against tier lists, but jiyuna does champion rollback so i'll respect it
[1:27:49] <%kennneh> Just got here did they switch games?
[1:27:49] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr That and SFV "rollback"
[1:27:56] <kotl7> love those drums
[1:28:00] <%3d_pbandj> wew riding that blood line
[1:28:00] <%ZeromusPrime93> Why I hate fighting Nagoriyuki's,Example #1
[1:28:11] <+balouie> is that normal for pc to have less lag than consoles
[1:28:15] <+fetrigon> free
[1:28:35] <Dave_VD> @ZeromusPrime93 I prefer Woolieyuki myself
[1:28:41] <dellis80> does deactivation act like an RC?
[1:28:53] <andre11dr> Kinda
[1:29:01] <+fetrigon> free
[1:29:17] <andre11dr> I don't think the frame advantage is as good
[1:29:28] <leith_aziz> I love how this theme switches from instructing Ram at the start (Ariels), then the vocalist's voice is switched, representing Ram's own thought process and that "Disceprancy is Necessary"
[1:29:28] <andre11dr> Maybe it is ,i don't play Nago
[1:29:43] <leith_aziz> This the kinda shit I talked about earlier
[1:29:46] <%ZeromusPrime93> God I love this song
[1:30:23] <+balouie> if they ever did crossplay between console and pc would the input lag be a major hinderance for console players?
[1:30:35] <andre11dr> I mean fighting over vocal tracks is nothing new, Xrd had that
[1:30:37] <leith_aziz> @balouie Isnt it true that some games just have different delay
[1:30:39] <+TopTieramisu> god damn
[1:30:55] <bigshedman> @andre11dr True but not as many
[1:31:04] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr That's a compliment, I wasnt complainiing, but yeah, Raven had vocals as well
[1:31:24] <leith_aziz> Xrd in terms of character themes only had 2 vocal tracks, Sol and Raven's
[1:31:31] <%3d_pbandj> Reggie ain't playing around no more
[1:31:57] <+balouie> no clue dont play fighting games competitively so just curious.
[1:31:58] <andre11dr> When i got to pick the song in Xrd i usually go to Six Black Heaven guns
[1:32:09] <TigerClaws12> the blender
[1:32:09] <andre11dr> That or the Instant theme
[1:32:13] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Not a bad pick IMO
[1:32:34] <%ZeromusPrime93> When in doubt; CROUCHING DUST
[1:32:42] <leith_aziz> There's that Fukyo tech I keep dying to
[1:32:51] <+jepupu> Millia's air combos are wild.

[1:32:51] <+TopTieramisu> ROFL
[1:32:53] <+fetrigon> oof
[1:32:53] <bigshedman> Wait can you duck under bite?
[1:32:57] <leith_aziz> Slap that hand
[1:33:01] <+RoniusAdethel> Choke indeed.
[1:33:05] <%he1lhydra> no, woolie was too far
[1:33:12] <bigshedman> Ah ok, cheers.
[1:33:13] <%ZeromusPrime93> JESUS
[1:33:18] <NotHereToStream> hair car in neutral
[1:33:20] <leith_aziz> On wakeup, throws only connect 5 frames later compared to a meaty
[1:33:27] <leith_aziz> There's a slight difference
[1:33:36] <leith_aziz> That's why some throws often whiff
[1:34:10] <blackkanye> I always gotta warm up
[1:34:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[1:34:21] <andre11dr> Yeah this matchup is interesting, either Milia knocks him down and runs a train or he hits her 3 times and she dies
[1:34:24] <leith_aziz> I just go in and play
[1:34:25] <blackkanye> I just totally forget things if I don't somehow
[1:34:28] <SykoReaper> Negroids unite!
[1:34:50] <Equirah> i always have to warm up, then i have some good matches, then my brain shuts down for some reason
[1:34:54] <%ZeromusPrime93> WOOLIE YOU FOOL
[1:34:54] <anarchistPastry> the no-crossup crossup
[1:34:59] <andre11dr> If Milia gets the head start it's very hard for Nago
[1:34:59] <blackkanye> @Equirah Same
[1:35:04] <TigerClaws12> romollaBurger gamer hands
[1:35:14] <andre11dr> The only thing he can do is Super
[1:35:22] <leith_aziz> That's just Millia's stength. Strong mixups from Oki
[1:35:41] <+RoniusAdethel> So, anybody beat the stage 9 infinite blood nago yet?
[1:35:49] <JazzerThighsSSBM> !uptime
[1:35:49] <@Moobot> @JazzerThighsSSBM WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 4 minutes
[1:35:49] <leith_aziz> @RoniusAdethel Yep. With Sol
[1:35:52] <Equirah> yeah
[1:35:58] <NotHereToStream> yeah, i had to cheese stage 9 nago
[1:36:02] <NotHereToStream> with nago and sol
[1:36:03] <TigerClaws12> stage 9 is so cheesable with Zato
[1:36:03] <JazzerThighsSSBM> they done with 5ff?
[1:36:10] <%Deft_Thought> That double dash put him in a weird spot
[1:36:14] <leith_aziz> Knock Nago down, jump with Sol and do a air DP right before getting to the ground
[1:36:26] <leith_aziz> Nago will try to DP, but your will always come out first
[1:36:47] <SykoReaper> Woolie quit respecting randos online! More buttons!
[1:36:53] <andre11dr> That's the one thing with Nago that seems kind wierd, if your going to give him the blood mechanic at least give him 1 reversal
[1:37:12] <Equirah> @SykoReaper he's playing reggie LUL
[1:37:16] <+Shoosler> @SykoReaper lol wut
[1:37:21] <bigshedman> Nago having no reversals and no overheads aside from Dust is really weird to me
[1:37:28] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr The Spin is kinda that but ity works more as a catching you off cuard anbd getting a big COUNTER hit
[1:37:40] <%ZeromusPrime93> Aaaaaaaand that's why I don't play Nagoriyuki
[1:37:43] <SykoReaper> Well this is embarrassing
[1:37:50] <leith_aziz> Like Nago can delay a button then Spin. Instant 50%
[1:37:56] <+RoniusAdethel> I attempted it with Axl to little avail. Think I'd have to do it with either Sol or Zato to eek out the win?
[1:37:58] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz It not invincible tho
[1:38:10] <andre11dr> You can definitely hit him out of it
[1:38:12] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr No, it just catches you for how fast the startup is
[1:38:22] <andre11dr> Well i say that ,i do play Sol LUL
[1:38:24] <leith_aziz> It also low profiles from what I've seen
[1:38:34] <TigerClaws12> yea game hitche
[1:38:38] <TigerClaws12> *hitched
[1:38:43] <kotl7> why does Woolie never seem to have fun when playing with Nago? meanwhile Reggie is smiling all the time, it's weird
[1:38:55] <NotHereToStream> @RoniusAdethel you know how to do a delay throw tech? thats how i cheesed nago
[1:39:00] <leith_aziz> @kotl7 Nago is the calm and coordinated playstyle
[1:39:01] <FightningX> Playing Nago is a lot of mental energy
[1:39:05] <leith_aziz> Wiining is the reward
[1:39:17] <SykoReaper> Reggie starts throwing matches when he goes in too hard
[1:39:20] <leith_aziz> When you feel like you outsmarted the opponent, less the match itself
[1:39:20] <bigshedman> Probably just Woolie's face when he focusses, I doubt he isn't actually enjoying this.
[1:39:24] <+CreggaMonsta> 5 Force Fighters?
[1:39:35] <+RoniusAdethel> @NotHereToStream I don't know about that. Suppose I'll hit up dust loop for the info.
[1:39:45] <SykoReaper> I’m just talking shit today
[1:39:46] <andre11dr> So chat, what do you think of Copo
[1:40:06] <NotHereToStream> @RoniusAdethel basically run up to nago on wakeup, as soon as he is up, hold back, then like 1/2 frames later back throw him
[1:40:11] <kotl7> true, but one seems to have lot more fun than the other, to me
[1:40:28] <leith_aziz> @kotl7 On is getting mixed by Millia, so yeah...
[1:40:31] <andre11dr> It's interesting how he seems kind slow
[1:40:32] <leith_aziz> *one
[1:40:38] <%he1lhydra> fuckin 6H otg is so gross
[1:40:40] <stevenellis386> man reggie can throw down
[1:40:45] <+RoniusAdethel> @NotHereToStream So the goal is to block his wakeup and throw immediately eh?
[1:40:49] <bigshedman> @kotl7 Yeah I can see that, I guess Reggie is just more expressive during gameplay.
[1:41:05] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus you still have the game catagory set to 5 force fighters
[1:41:14] <TigerClaws12> hair car oki LUL
[1:41:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:41:19] <leith_aziz> oh damn, you're right
[1:41:22] <NotHereToStream> @RoniusAdethel basically nago will read your input, and think oh hes not attacking, I won't do my DP, and if he doesn't attack, back throw him
[1:41:29] <SykoReaper> So we cool with Reggie throwing games for his homie?
[1:41:36] <leith_aziz> @SykoReaper nah
[1:41:59] <Equirah> @SykoReaper you'd think you'd shut up LUL
[1:42:16] <+RoniusAdethel> @NotHereToStream Cool, thanks.
[1:42:19] <stevenellis386> ok reggie
[1:42:26] <SykoReaper> If I was speaking sure
[1:42:27] <andre11dr> The only thing Reggie is throwing is Woolies ass in the corner for a vortex
[1:42:32] <NotHereToStream> @RoniusAdethel he will throw the occasionaly DP, so becareful
[1:42:47] <leith_aziz> Getting late out here. Thanks for the stream, guys.
[1:42:54] <Equirah> you better get in that park
[1:42:58] <NotHereToStream> later leith
[1:43:13] <stevenellis386> nice
[1:43:37] <SykoReaper> Leith gotta make sure his favorite bench isn’t taken for the night
[1:43:47] <Equirah> ....
[1:44:06] <SykoReaper> I’m cooking today
[1:44:23] <SykoReaper> Ready for all the fuegos
[1:44:33] <+Shoosler> @SykoReaper k dude
[1:44:39] <TigerClaws12> 2 blood HS romollaGuck
[1:45:13] <+OrangeMDT> Man, Nago really can’t do much when someone’s jumping. Like 2H sometimes works out, but the risk/reward in just jumping is so much more on the latter
[1:45:21] <andre11dr> Almost poping
[1:45:53] <andre11dr> Damn Woolie is a little free here huh
[1:45:54] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @OrangeMDT against some characters air to airs or air grab is a good option, you can follow up air grab with a 6H
[1:46:21] <Dave_VD> Reggie lookin clean
[1:46:27] <SykoReaper> Free.99
[1:47:45] <DSD24> Does it still show 5 Force Fighters for you guys on the stream?
[1:47:55] <StreamingInVain> yup
[1:47:55] <andre11dr> Yes
[1:47:59] <kotl7> yea
[1:48:02] <PMda2nd> yup
[1:48:02] <andre11dr> Woolie didn't change it
[1:48:25] <DSD24> Ok I wanted to make sure it wasn't just me, he should probably change it
[1:48:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:48:47] <SykoReaper> Ay Reggie that’s a grown man u doing that to
[1:48:51] <primaryfire> jesus
[1:49:23] <primaryfire> buff nago cmd grab range
[1:49:23] <SykoReaper> Woof
[1:49:32] <stevenellis386> yo reggie found his character for sure
[1:49:49] <Equirah> we havn't seen reggie use any other
[1:50:18] <+Shoosler> doodHokey
[1:50:23] <kotl7> he played some Axl last week iirc
[1:50:31] <FrostedZaibatsu> Game is still on 5 FOrce FIghter
[1:50:34] <Dave_VD> @stevenellis386 Pretty sure he's been on Millia since before release LUL
[1:50:35] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[1:50:37] <andre11dr> Yeah this looks rough, but trust me if Nago hits Milia with an semi optimal combo, she loses like half of her life
[1:50:42] <Demoli_PT> i'm surprised reggie didnt default to chipp tbh
[1:50:57] <andre11dr> But Woolie ain't pulling those now
[1:50:58] <kotl7> chipp is mad fun tbh
[1:51:00] <SykoReaper> Woolie might find his challenge with LTG
[1:51:06] <primaryfire> I'm surprised he didnt default to sol or ky as a poster boy enthusiast
[1:51:14] <kikoeru_san> Woolie wearing the face of a man that picked a really hard character
[1:51:20] <+RoniusAdethel> Seeing Woolie get bodied like this reminds me of my brief time in floor 10.
[1:51:23] <NotHereToStream> got to swat the millia fly
[1:51:25] <stevenellis386> @Dave_VD not that I've seen
[1:51:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> this matchup is just really rough for Nago, one of his roughest in the game
[1:51:38] <Demoli_PT> nago is hella hard but boy does he have a reward
[1:51:46] <andre11dr> Nago is actually a really good caracter, but his hard to play
[1:51:47] <SykoReaper> Getting sonicfox v peefectlegend vibes
[1:51:47] <+OrangeMDT> @dr_dangerphd true true. I’m just remembering playing against Milia, Chipp, and Faust, and their air options (even when predicted) just beat Nago. Not like it’s really unfair or anything, just saying Nago vs someone with good air option is a 4:6 match up at best
[1:52:45] <user_naim> ooh we strivin?
[1:52:46] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @OrangeMDT in general, I don't have a lot of trouble with Faust, but Chipp especially can get tripped up by air to air grabs to counter their dash/jump gameplan
[1:52:48] <user_naim> sweet
[1:53:01] <stevenellis386> dancing all over woolie
[1:53:07] <stevenellis386> damn
[1:53:21] <andre11dr> Yeah dosen't have RC on lock yet
[1:53:28] <+OrangeMDT> @dr_dangerphd I’ll try that then
[1:53:38] <Hirumm> has woolie checked out the mod that randomly picks a song on rematch?
[1:54:03] <Dave_VD> @stevenellis386 Bruh you can find the vod of them playing the second beta on youtube and Reg's playing Millia
[1:54:09] <SpodFish> @Hirumm please link
[1:54:13] <SykoReaper> Sheboygan
[1:54:16] <+colon_crush> is this new guilty gear?
[1:54:19] <+MKevin98> what you guys think about the new character
[1:54:29] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @OrangeMDT just be mindful of spacing and if they start jump 2K'ing have a 6p or 623HS on lock to stuff it
[1:54:35] <user_naim> @mkevin98 IN THIS BEHEMOTH TYPHOON
[1:54:38] <kotl7> @Hirumm I would love a link as well
[1:54:38] <bigshedman> @MKevin98 What a hottie
[1:54:44] <+MKevin98> that maximum typhoon
[1:54:45] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Hirumm
[1:54:46] <+RoniusAdethel> @MKevin98 I like that he has 8 different half circle combinations.
[1:54:51] <SykoReaper> Nah its the new Dragon’s Dogma
[1:54:54] <SpodFish> ah rip
[1:55:01] <kotl7> LUL rip
[1:55:09] <copyritetm> Oh we're playingstrive!
[1:55:31] <user_naim> I wont be able to block any of Lickgold Dewsinsons moves for the first couple weeks
[1:55:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:55:39] <%illtima> Woolie disrespected
[1:55:44] <DSD24> Get in there and MIX IT UP
[1:55:54] <kikoeru_san> Woolie feeling the heat
[1:55:55] <Demoli_PT> fast characters dont have to respect blood mode
[1:55:58] <SykoReaper> Salt
[1:55:59] <andre11dr> Woolie knows about the instant overhead in blood mode right?
[1:56:03] <Demoli_PT> you dont have specials t match their speed
[1:56:08] <Demoli_PT> so they just get in
[1:56:09] <SpodFish> THE WHAT
[1:56:21] <+RoniusAdethel> I felt bad watching Reggie get a wall break combo at the beginning of the round.
[1:56:37] <bigshedman> @andre11dr I sure don't. Do tell!
[1:56:40] <user_naim> Two?
[1:56:43] <user_naim> How?
[1:56:57] <kikoeru_san> @roniusadethel that's just Millia
[1:57:01] <andre11dr> I think you press H as you jump
[1:57:38] <kotl7> oh yeah, cause the dick gets longer in blood mode
[1:57:38] <NotHereToStream> i dunno, j.HS has a long start up so i think people can react to it relatively quickly
[1:57:59] <andre11dr> The move where hes stabbing down, you press that as you leave the ground and it's an instant overhead in blood mode
[1:57:59] <+Dr_DangerPhD> yeah, even in blood rage j.HS is like 12-14 frames I think
[1:58:06] <SpodFish> oh damn
[1:58:11] <anarchistPastry> THE ROMAN CANCEL CANCEL
[1:58:12] <+RoniusAdethel> Nice use of blood there.
[1:58:18] <bigshedman> Oh my lord I just started looking at Goldlewis' moveset. What the FUCK is his Behemoth Typhoon?!

[1:58:36] <user_naim> @bigshedman whatever you want it to be
[1:58:38] <Gamenoob11> @bigshedman " T H I S "
[1:58:39] <blue6sub6remnant6> @bigshedman Yes. His moveset is behemoth typhoo.
[1:58:45] <kotl7> it's THIS behemoth typhoon, not A behemoth typhoon, get it right
[1:58:45] <%Irridium> @bigshedman speen to ween
[1:58:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> n
[1:59:01] <+OrangeMDT> Least and most specials
[1:59:02] <bigshedman> Good lord. I wish some characters had more moves but this is ridiculous lmao

[1:59:57] <stevenellis386> @Dave_VD I don't have that kind of time bro
[2:00:01] <SpodFish> I wonder how blocking golddick is gonna be
[2:00:05] <NotHereToStream> wouldn't it be sometimes better just to fast dust and RC it into a combo

[2:03:40] <Demoli_PT> bursting on the disc is an oof
[2:03:42] <+RoniusAdethel> 2 bursts from a single player in round 1, that seems rare.
[2:03:44] <Demoli_PT> or popping
[2:04:03] <andre11dr> @xerotwo That's actually the name for when you burst the last hit for the combo LUL
[2:04:14] <TigerClaws12> sending that hair car
[2:04:24] <+xerotwo> so similar to a Chicago Punish?
[2:04:24] <andre11dr> Texas burst is wake up gold burst
[2:04:32] <user_naim> Learned today that Nago’s anti air move can even beat out Giovanna’s ground super apparently
[2:04:38] <andre11dr> I forget the other ones
[2:04:45] <user_naim> Unless I was hallucinating
[2:04:47] <FrostedZaibatsu> This stage shouldnt be laggy
[2:05:01] <SpodFish> ram theme
[2:05:12] <+Dr_DangerPhD> I read there was 5 frames of throw invuln on wakeup apparently, but haven't confirmed that yet
[2:05:14] <TigerClaws12> yea it's the 2nd least laggy stage
[2:05:41] <Dave_VD> I fished heavy day and have had that playing in pretty much all my matches since
[2:06:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> I believe the City and Air Ship stages have the most lag
[2:06:22] <Meltgar> Yeah, all those animations take their toll
[2:06:47] <%Shad0wTag> Yo chat, hows the stream been?
[2:06:51] <TigerClaws12> yea the EVA machine shouldn't hitch in this game
[2:07:09] <Demoli_PT> do you have anything eating your cpu?
[2:07:28] <Meltgar> Woolie has THE CRUZ BROTHERS Game on background Kappa
[2:07:39] <andre11dr> Oh yeah and Japanese burst is you burst on the first hit they land on you
[2:07:41] <%he1lhydra> @WoolieVersus the hitches have happened to me in training mode in this stage. also, change the game on stream
[2:07:55] <+breakersnap> this isnt 5 force fighters?
[2:08:02] <DSD24> I like Nago color
[2:08:06] <TigerClaws12> denim Millia DansGame
[2:08:10] <DSD24> I like that one I mean
[2:08:11] <Demoli_PT> @breakersnap that was before
[2:09:03] <SpodFish> godlike song godlike song
[2:09:05] <+Dr_DangerPhD> ok yeah, just checked dustloop and you have 5 frames of throw invuln after knockdown
[2:09:07] <SykoReaper> This like when my judo sensei used to put me against this chick 3 belt grades above me to whoop my ass for talking so much shit
[2:09:11] <Meltgar> MAN REGGIE GOING HAM

[2:13:03] <+RoniusAdethel> That jab
[2:13:16] <%wolfofsound> palm heel strike!
[2:13:35] <PFlare> He needs to start throwing light discs so he can't jump out of the setup.
[2:14:06] <SykoReaper> Destruco disc stronk
[2:14:09] <+OroOreo> fire Everything
[2:14:13] <+jepupu> Chipp damage
[2:14:32] <TigerClaws12> that was a hitch right there
[2:14:36] <andre11dr> I'm kinda sad she doesn't have Secret Garden anymore
[2:14:56] <+coward_man> damn reggie got da moves
[2:15:19] <PFlare> She'd be insane if she had that.
[2:15:45] <Hirumm> that BRC was great reggie
[2:15:49] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[2:16:05] <kotl7> Millia saying gomen on throws, but everyone knows she's not really gomen
[2:16:13] <TigerClaws12> NICE BAIT
[2:16:26] <+sadnroramo> clean reggie damn
[2:16:33] <user_naim> nice
[2:16:36] <+coward_man> I'd like to report a fucking murder!
[2:17:07] <user_naim> too bad woolie isn’t easily spooked
[2:17:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:17:10] <Demoli_PT> these two need to air grab on their RCs more
[2:17:14] <andre11dr> Wait so did Woolie make it to Celestial?
[2:17:19] <NotHereToStream> he did
[2:17:27] <andre11dr> Cause he ain't playing like it
[2:17:36] <SykoReaper> Dammmm
[2:17:40] <user_naim> @andre11dr cold
[2:17:43] <+jepupu> I miss Ky's j.D boosting stun edges the most
[2:17:48] <Meltgar> If you want to beat the promos, play against other promo players
[2:17:49] <+coward_man> sometimes you have an off day
[2:17:51] <Meltgar> Dont go against VIP
[2:17:52] <SykoReaper> Andree with the mac11
[2:17:53] <+OroOreo> kobe
[2:17:55] <Meltgar> they have nothing to lose
[2:17:55] <+RoniusAdethel> @andre11dr He did, he got VIP too.
[2:18:37] <andre11dr> I'm saying, Ive been hit Nago combos that he ain't doing
[2:18:38] <+OroOreo> mask on rc into air throw? very cool
[2:18:56] <+jepupu> Having a DP against Millia makes things so much more tolerable
[2:19:30] <Hirumm> so close woolie
[2:19:31] <+RoniusAdethel> pro grab of reggie out of his BRC
[2:19:35] <%he1lhydra> it's almost like everyone is proficient at different things and combos don't make up the entirety of fighting games
[2:19:45] <kojanga> I'm having a hard time with inputs as zato and thinking of getting a hitbox, any advice?
[2:20:17] <Demoli_PT> you probably do it full screen most of the time woolie
[2:20:21] <Demoli_PT> thats VERY minues
[2:20:26] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @kojanga if you're on pc, you can set up your keyboard to a hitbox setup to see if that would work for you
[2:20:32] <Demoli_PT> -66 on block
[2:20:43] <kotl7> wow a full second
[2:20:45] <TigerClaws12> he knows, he was just trying to catch a button
[2:20:45] <kotl7> damn
[2:21:09] <kojanga> the pc does a number in my wrist
[2:21:13] <TigerClaws12> reggie's 2K recovered
[2:21:15] <kojanga> keyboard
[2:21:28] <%themanski_90> themanski_90 gifted a Tier 1 sub to kotl7! They have given 5 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:21:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @kojanga hitbox is basically the same as playing on keyboard, so it might not be a good idea then
[2:21:59] <anarchistPastry> is this stage the backyard or some shit
[2:22:05] <TigerClaws12> task failed successfully
[2:22:09] <%kotl7> @themanski_90 wow thanks ! you're pretty cool I guess!

[2:24:57] <%kotl7> RC stare down, that was spooky
[2:25:12] <+RoniusAdethel> Did Woolie make it to Legend in hearthstone? Because he sure presses end turn and lets Reggie play a ton.

[2:29:00] <+OrangeMDT> Woolie, you have a blood gauge man
[2:29:11] <%townzzzzz> Did Woolie beat his inner demons?
[2:29:25] <andre11dr> Yo Hotashi is a beast ,don't disrespect
[2:29:31] <SykoReaper> Did woolie get granted eyes on the inside to cleanse his beastly idiocy?
[2:29:44] <andre11dr> Also he perfected me once so there's that LUL
[2:29:50] <NotHereToStream> whiffing a button against a fast character gotta hurt
[2:30:25] <jemeralddragoon> ooooooh that millia combo tho
[2:30:28] <Meltgar> MAN
[2:30:35] <Meltgar> Millia is such a pain if she gets on you
[2:30:57] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @StrawberryPantsu
[2:31:08] <+Mendacii> I REALLY need to get the roman cancels down.
[2:31:20] <jemeralddragoon> i like watching reggie play her, it helps me learn what to do as her.
[2:31:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[2:31:24] <+Mendacii> Savage
[2:31:28] <andre11dr> Yeah Millia is the best vortex against a character with no reversals, it's rough if she gets started
[2:31:31] <+Mendacii> GG Reggie
[2:31:33] <Lionkevinson> damn reggie
[2:31:50] <+Mendacii> maybe I can absorb some power via osmosis
[2:32:02] <andre11dr> Yeah Nago doesn't really get air combos
[2:32:02] <SykoReaper> Rare instance of some good reggie
[2:32:15] <user_naim> Woolie window shopping for a pocket Millia maybe?
[2:32:19] <SykoReaper> Lil 420 joke for you nerds
[2:32:30] <+Mendacii> @sykoreaper hehehe
[2:32:36] <andre11dr> Nah Woolie ain't playing anything but Nago
[2:32:53] <+RoniusAdethel> I feel like I'm a lot less afraid of Nago's blood fury now.
[2:32:58] <+Mrbaconator> IN THIS BEHEMOTH TYPHOON
[2:33:04] <user_naim> @andre11dr let’s check back after 17 more air combos
[2:33:06] <andre11dr> He has stuck by bad caracters in the past just for visuals

[2:33:28] <jemeralddragoon> absolutely, as long as you can wait it out or dodge/block appropriately, its not that scary
[2:33:44] <%Sparkseid> RC for everybody
[2:33:50] <+Mendacii> The air is death I guess holy hell
[2:34:08] <+vaporousTippler> I mean, that's one way to not die with meter.
[2:34:10] <user_naim> but no I’m mainly just joking around
[2:34:31] <+Mendacii> suicide meter is FULL
[2:34:51] <Meltgar> How many specials can you do until Nago goes strawberry juice mode? Kappa
[2:34:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> Who's spell this is!?
[2:35:13] <%kotl7> @Meltgar like 5
[2:35:17] <+RoniusAdethel> But watching Reggie run into it basically everytime is kinda next level.
[2:35:19] <+Mendacii> @meltgar I know that it depends but for the beefier ones it seems like 4 to 5
[2:35:21] <andre11dr> @meltgar Depends
[2:35:22] <user_naim> @meltgar one too few apparently
[2:35:24] <SykoReaper> His hasn’t mastered his Haki yet
[2:35:31] <andre11dr> Some built more than other
[2:35:34] <+SwiftKojiro> about 3 if you dont get anyblood back different specials generate different blood values though i think
[2:35:36] <Meltgar> Ahhhh ok ok
[2:35:42] <%kotl7> definitely feels like one too few everytime
[2:35:44] <andre11dr> But maximum 5 or 6
[2:35:44] <+Mendacii> @swiftkojiro mmm true!
[2:35:56] <andre11dr> Unless you get it back down
[2:35:56] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[2:36:01] <jemeralddragoon> lmao grabbed out of rc
[2:36:17] <LorcaNomad> grab out of rc is so goofy

[2:36:32] <+SwiftKojiro> DUFFED
[2:36:38] <+Mendacii> @mrbaconator Jotaru grabs Dio during Za Warudo
[2:36:44] <+Mendacii> thatd be comedy
[2:37:13] <user_naim> @mendacii Joseph hitting that Hermit Purple
[2:37:22] <user_naim> Part 3 over
[2:37:32] <+Mendacii> @user_naim muda muda muda homie
[2:37:40] <jemeralddragoon> i main Filia in Skullgirls and it's clear she's heavily based on Milia and that gave me an edge when I tried Strive for the first time and picked her.
[2:37:50] <andre11dr> Can't you grab Axl out of Time Stop?
[2:37:54] <SykoReaper> He needs to switch to the tonfas
[2:38:04] <andre11dr> I never tried it because nobody uses it
[2:38:09] <+RoniusAdethel> @andre11dr You can just block time stop.
[2:38:11] <+Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon That's sick, I picked up Chipp, used to play Faust but I just couldn't hack him this time around.
[2:38:24] <Meltgar> You can probably find one of the world total of 6 Axl players out there Kappa
[2:38:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:38:43] <andre11dr> @meltgar I can think of 2
[2:38:51] <jemeralddragoon> @Mendacii it does seem like Faust plays a lot differently this time around so I don't blame you.
[2:38:58] <+RoniusAdethel> I'm an Axl player who managed to get to floor 10 >.>
[2:39:08] <Meltgar> @Mendacii I miss Faust's poggo and Doors
[2:39:20] <%Irridium> @RoniusAdethel same bro
[2:39:25] <LorcaNomad> PogChamp
[2:39:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> MHMMMM
[2:39:26] <+jepupu> Nice bite timing
[2:39:27] <jemeralddragoon> @RoniusAdethel noice
[2:39:29] <+Mendacii> Sounds like Woolz is getting a 2nd wind!
[2:39:35] <andre11dr> Yeah, i barely see any Fausts
[2:39:49] <+jepupu> I play on Europe. Everyone's Gio or Millia
[2:39:50] <SykoReaper> 3-77
[2:39:57] <SykoReaper> Even match
[2:40:05] <user_naim> @jepupu I get a trillion Kys in EU
[2:40:05] <jemeralddragoon> i want to learn Gio just because i love her fucking shoes lmao
[2:40:10] <+Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon Yeah! I just couldn't really get behind it this time. Felt like XRD squared lol
[2:40:10] <+FuqBoiSlim> Faust is in this game?
[2:40:18] <user_naim> And some Fausts too
[2:40:26] <Meltgar> Faust is my "For Fun" character, but almost everything beats his attacks
[2:40:28] <LorcaNomad> is reggie on celestial?
[2:40:31] <+jepupu> I haven't seen a single Ky. I'm on Floor 9 though, might be different there
[2:40:35] <andre11dr> I did fight one Faust that beat the shit out of me because i didn't understood how his scarecrow move works
[2:40:35] <+Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon YEAH! literally almost had me hopping on the aesthetic train lol
[2:40:37] <DSD24> That was a botch
[2:40:38] <EX_shuffle> that's gotta hurt
[2:40:42] <Lancaster_H> KomodoHype
[2:40:51] <user_naim> @jepupu Oh i’ve been on 7/8. Only just got to 9
[2:41:13] <+RoniusAdethel> I'd like to try Gio because I like how her delay combos look.
[2:41:19] <user_naim> @jepupu You’ve transcended the Ky Kiskes of the world
[2:41:24] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[2:41:25] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 9 minutes
[2:41:33] <jemeralddragoon> @Mendacii I was kind of hoping she would have some form of negative edge with the dog stand, but I like that it works as a follow up and gives some range
[2:41:36] <+Mendacii> Started on 7, been trying to lab around and learn Zato and Anji match ups.
[2:41:42] <%jolene_orenji> @andre11dr in case you still weren't sure: he can do three versions, one where he appears to your left, right, or above you. if he goes behind you your character will auto face him
[2:41:53] <+Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon Yeah, she ain't got ANY downside lol
[2:41:58] <user_naim> @roniusadethel her dash is so much fun
[2:41:59] <SykoReaper> I like Gio cuz her idle stance looks like she ready for doggy
[2:42:11] <+Mendacii> Imagine if Zwei in SC5 didn't suck butt
[2:42:20] <neroforte177> @SykoReaper ....whut
[2:42:21] <andre11dr> They should give Faust his +R pogo and drill all the sudden his top 3 LUL
[2:42:37] <+Mendacii> @andre11dr pls
[2:42:38] <jemeralddragoon> @SykoReaper hey man, we all miss Jack-O
[2:42:39] <+RoniusAdethel> @user_naim I always feel like the Gio who carried me from center stage to the wall and getting an immediate break is having fun.
[2:42:46] <user_naim> Dash -> 2D -> 214K feel so mean as Gio, but fun as hell
[2:43:21] <+RoniusAdethel> @jemeralddragoon Get your Jack-o fix in story mode.
[2:43:31] <%kotl7> Gio's 2D is really mean, I agree, the hitstun hurts more than the attack itself
[2:43:49] <jemeralddragoon> that mixup though
[2:43:50] <Meltgar> Gio's Knee is super annoying
[2:43:53] <DSD24> "Dodge this!"
[2:43:59] <%jolene_orenji> saw a player on the tower today named "Jack-O's2K" which is one of the best I've sen
[2:43:59] <Meltgar> ALWAYS beats how fast it is
[2:43:59] <+Mendacii> @roniusadethel or they're just doing g the same rotation from 30 matches ago lol. Maybe that's fun tho? idk man
[2:44:01] <%jolene_orenji> *seen
[2:44:19] <+Mendacii> @meltgar very
[2:44:31] <andre11dr> Man i can't wait to have Slayer back, I'm so sick of Sol mirrors
[2:44:35] <%Mendacii> Mendacii subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:44:37] <jemeralddragoon> @Mendacii I always do the exact same combo as RJ in Battle for the Grid and yes, it's fun lol
[2:44:40] <Demoli_PT> no audience matches tonight?
[2:44:46] <stoatacious> top tier waifu
[2:45:17] <%Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon Same with me as Kotal in MK11 except ya know, with jank ass netcode lol
[2:45:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Dandyism
[2:45:29] <mikeyjay47> Air throw has crazy range
[2:45:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:45:31] <jemeralddragoon> never forget the top sol player with the name "please nerf 6s"
[2:45:36] <andre11dr> Usually the person underneath will get the air throw
[2:45:49] <%Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon I fucken hollered when that dropped on the Pod lmao
[2:46:01] <+Dr_DangerPhD> yeah, it's better to think of the air throw hitbox as one that scoops as you go up
[2:46:13] <%Mendacii> THERE IT GOES
[2:46:19] <jemeralddragoon> @Mendacii if I had been driving at the time, I probably would have driven into a wall
[2:46:31] <+RoniusAdethel> @Mendacii I think hitting any combo is fun.
[2:46:31] <%Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon lmao same same same
[2:46:39] <user_naim> @mendacii same here
[2:46:56] <%Mendacii> @roniusadethel oh agreed. press the button, feel contact, release the chemical
[2:46:59] <jemeralddragoon> @RoniusAdethel absolutely, its just learning those combos and the timing and whatnot
[2:47:26] <andre11dr> I am a Sol main....they should nerf 6S
[2:47:43] <%Mendacii> @user_naim Almost had the feeling of "Yeah, I know this sucks, but it's so easy. and it does a lot of damage."
[2:47:46] <SykoReaper> Get eat your greens and brush your teeth then your input game will improve
[2:47:51] <andre11dr> Why does it have so much priority LUL
[2:48:01] <%fizzguy47> @andre11dr Anong other things
[2:48:17] <+RoniusAdethel> @jemeralddragoon It's very dangerous to listen to the podcast while driving. When Pat suggested that Epstein Choke-Jerked I was driving 85 MPH on a highway and was guffawing HARD.
[2:48:22] <%Mendacii> because himb Sol Bestguy
[2:48:24] <%Sparkseid> Reggie unleashed
[2:48:25] <user_naim> reminds me of Happy Souls
[2:48:52] <%Mendacii> @user_naim exactly what I was referencing lmao
[2:48:54] <andre11dr> Ok if they nerf Sol ,nerf Ram too
[2:48:59] <debrv> Yooooo How ya doin' Wools?
[2:49:01] <user_naim> @mendacii knew it
[2:49:03] <jemeralddragoon> @user_naim "why does everyone keep stabbing me in the back?!"
[2:49:09] <SykoReaper> Ram looking like a double wide surprise
[2:49:14] <%fizzguy47> @andre11dr Sire, why not
[2:49:26] <%Mendacii> @sykoreaper pffffft lmao
[2:49:40] <%Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon The Mustache and lag spund effects
[2:49:45] <%jolene_orenji> @andre11dr nerf everyone but potemkin. potemkin becomes the only viable character. Megafist reigns supreme
[2:49:58] <+RoniusAdethel> Nerf everyone, but buff Axl's j. p, 2p, and 5p.
[2:50:08] <%jolene_orenji> GIVE POTEMKIN A DP
[2:50:08] <andre11dr> Mai is actually not even that bad once you learn your way around SeaWorld
[2:50:08] <jemeralddragoon> nerf Chipp
[2:50:10] <jemeralddragoon> that is all
[2:50:12] <%Grimlockfly> @andre11dr give him a faster jab, because he's a good boy
[2:50:18] <%Mendacii> "IM SORRRREEEEE. GIT GUUUUD* Fucken Bell...
[2:50:20] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> that was spicy
[2:50:23] <LorcaNomad> PogChamp that bait tho
[2:50:24] <SykoReaper> Buff kitana
[2:50:34] <jemeralddragoon> TOUTSUGEKI
[2:50:35] <%Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon no make better the chipp! for the reasons!
[2:50:48] <jemeralddragoon> @Mendacii :3
[2:50:50] <%Grimlockfly> Never stop nerfing chip
[2:50:55] <+RoniusAdethel> Mei from Overwatch and May from GG Strive are both considered satans for a reason.
[2:51:06] <andre11dr> @grimlockfly Y'all are saying this shit but you forgot when they buffet Johnny
[2:51:16] <%debrv> debrv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! A year and two months huh..... Hypest 14 Months of the chillest group of people ever. Keep Rocking and rivalling the hype of Maximillian Dood, my friend.
[2:51:17] <mikeyjay47> @andre11dr dolphin isn't what makes may busted. it's her crazy impossible to stop disjointed normals
[2:51:26] <+jepupu> Chipp's command throw needs a recovery nerf at least. I can't think of much else for him
[2:51:32] <jemeralddragoon> @andre11dr the buffed Johnny by removing him from the game lmao
[2:51:48] <%Mendacii> @jemeralddragoon Damb
[2:51:59] <+RoniusAdethel> @jemeralddragoon Exactly, noone can hurt Johnny now.
[2:52:15] <user_naim> Johnny beat everyone and retired
[2:52:16] <SykoReaper> Johnny busy training Bridget in the ways of the ripple
[2:52:27] <%Mendacii> alright, time cook, friendos. Peace out and stay hyped! SEEYA IN THE TOWER!
[2:52:28] <jemeralddragoon> man, im such a loser. i really want Testament to come back
[2:52:39] <user_naim> @mendacii peace
[2:52:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:52:52] <jemeralddragoon> @Mendacii have a good day my guy
[2:52:56] <+jepupu> I want Zappa back, but I guess he's canonically cured.
[2:53:00] <andre11dr> Ok but really what was more fucked, when they buffet Johnny or when they buffet Cell
[2:53:22] <Meltgar> @jepupu Psssh, i want justice and kliff and they are DEAD AF Kappa Keep asking for zappa dude
[2:53:33] <SykoReaper> Quit whiffin
[2:53:44] <+RoniusAdethel> I think based on Goldlewis being the first announced character, we're probably going to get characters who were in Strive's story mode before we get Johnny, Elphnelt, or Bridget.
[2:54:02] <user_naim> Bring back Robo-Ky so he can burn down Jam’s restaurant again
[2:54:04] <CheyMix> that air poke with the sword seems bad to contest with
[2:54:09] <Meltgar> Well Baiken apparently isn't in this 1st pack DLC
[2:54:11] <CheyMix> agaisnt millia anyway
[2:54:14] <Meltgar> Probably 2nd DLC pack
[2:54:15] <jemeralddragoon> @Meltgar I dunno, I'm sure I-no could pull some time shenanigans and get Kliff back in here
[2:54:23] <+RoniusAdethel> I think playing Colin Vernon will be pretty dope though.
[2:54:28] <LorcaNomad> @RoniusAdethel ya I saw someone who thought jam would be next and I was like "are you insane"
[2:54:41] <DSD24> Break the walls down!
[2:55:15] <%fizzguy47> I want to see how Gabriel would play
[2:55:19] <user_naim> Jam might be next
[2:55:19] <Meltgar> I still don't know why chat, but is Jam GG story heavy? Or just because she's a character everyone liked?
[2:55:20] <andre11dr> Honestly I'm most excited to see some of the XX characters that never got in Xrd to be into this
[2:55:34] <andre11dr> Like Zappa and Testament
[2:55:36] <jemeralddragoon> fuck all that, I want to play as Ramlethal's puppy
[2:55:40] <%kotl7> she's a waifu
[2:55:47] <user_naim> Feels like she would be the easiest to get out next
[2:55:51] <andre11dr> But they would probably have to nerf those two
[2:55:57] <Meltgar> I'm surprised Testament didn't get a spot in Rev
[2:56:00] <Meltgar> Or XRD
[2:56:02] <SykoReaper> Les sous ensembles, dans les grands ensembles, s’assemblent
[2:56:06] <andre11dr> Actually no, DEFINITELY nerf those two LUL
[2:56:20] <+RoniusAdethel> @jemeralddragoon 1v1 me and you'll end up like the puppy.
[2:56:37] <%kotl7> @SykoReaper la belle et le mauvais garçon ?
[2:56:46] <jemeralddragoon> @RoniusAdethel ...biting your fingers?
[2:56:55] <SykoReaper> La belle et le bad boy! Ding ding ding
[2:56:58] <user_naim> GG Pet Fighter: Gio’s Rei, Ram’s puppy, Chipps otter...
[2:56:58] <+RoniusAdethel> @jemeralddragoon And where is the one who bit her fingers now?
[2:57:12] <+RoniusAdethel> Wait, Chipp has an otter?
[2:57:12] <SykoReaper> That’s a classic
[2:57:13] <user_naim> Put lucifero in there why not
[2:57:33] <%kotl7> I used to listen to it against my will in the bus to school LUL
[2:57:35] <jemeralddragoon> @RoniusAdethel as dead as you'll be when my Milia wrecks your shit
[2:57:46] <wasdknife> i made some minis of you and pat on hero forged
[2:58:05] <andre11dr> Fuck it, nake the president playable
[2:58:08] <SykoReaper> Mc Solaar is a legend
[2:58:20] <jemeralddragoon> love Reggie getting in there instead of cowarding out
[2:58:25] <+RoniusAdethel> @jemeralddragoon Bring on the fight stick. I can take floor 10 Millias.
[2:58:26] <%kotl7> Vernon has sick punch combos, but Gabriel comes first
[2:58:31] <SykoReaper> Can def see that as a kid though lol
[2:58:33] <%fizzguy47> 50% lol
[2:58:33] <anarchistPastry> i blinked
[2:58:47] <stoveoven> ooh these animations are delicious
[2:59:04] <SykoReaper> Someone pull the plug and save the ma
[2:59:32] <andre11dr> Damn Reggie has those conversions on lock

[3:00:45] <%kotl7> I 5p'd as Chipp so I was fine
[3:00:47] <%kotl7> I hope
[3:02:05] <andre11dr> Yeah at that point Woolie should dash and grab
[3:02:06] <SykoReaper> La personne après moi a une bite minuscule
[3:02:18] <andre11dr> If he pops he pops
[3:03:06] <andre11dr> His under you ,it's harder to grab him like that

[3:03:29] <user_naim> ”We’re touching each other, we’re in the air” sounds like an annoying song lyric

[3:04:57] <Demoli_PT> damn the boys are running long sets tonight
[3:05:36] <%kotl7> can Nago jump cancel his close S? that could make a burst bait maybe?
[3:05:53] <andre11dr> I think he can

[3:07:25] <user_naim> Reggie shot woolie with the super
[3:07:32] <user_naim> had no tension to block
[3:07:39] <%blacksoap65> Reggie Styling
[3:08:13] <+MisterArcanine> Reggie is tired of seeing Millia getting styled on in everyone's combo videos
[3:08:25] <andre11dr> There we go Woolie
[3:08:37] <andre11dr> That's what it should look like
[3:08:55] <+Pittor_Pat> that was clean

[3:09:45] <%Sypheck> ham super FortHype
[3:09:45] <KroqGar> After their local matches, do they play ranked random tower or do they make a lobby?
[3:09:46] <user_naim> Woolie did do all those thing after all
[3:10:00] <andre11dr> I'm rooting for Woolie now, Reggie is getting away with this
[3:10:22] <+IHATREID> woolie rocking a murderface during matches
[3:11:20] <%Sypheck> woolie needs to abuse more beyblade in this MU
[3:11:47] <andre11dr> CHOP
[3:11:55] <Smitteys867> @woolieversus since the game has been out for a while now, how strong do you think Nago is? It seems people have really changed their opinions of him since launch
[3:12:01] <+MisterArcanine> That chop otg is so terrifying
[3:12:41] <dandy_bones> Woolie’s making a comeback
[3:12:55] <user_naim> got the burst out of him nice
[3:13:13] <user_naim> Reggie made the best of that round
[3:13:22] <andre11dr> Woolie, you get hard knockdown after wall brake super, why did you just stood there LUL
[3:14:45] <alcmo> literally every time LUL
[3:14:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:14:46] <Lancaster_H> LUL
[3:14:58] <user_naim> reggie getting woolie to burst the first round might have contributed to this
[3:15:19] <andre11dr> Yeah bas burst
[3:15:29] <andre11dr> Bad*
[3:15:40] <user_naim> This is pretty exciting to watch
[3:15:45] <%townzzzzz> nargo needs to find him a blood gal for himself to get over this rage
[3:15:45] <Hirumm> anyone else getting intense screen tearing?
[3:15:57] <mikeyjay47> woolie really needs to respect reggie's oki
[3:16:01] <%kotl7> not me @Hirumm
[3:16:09] <andre11dr> He keeps bursting when Reggie is full heath and he has like 20%
[3:16:39] <Hirumm> @kotl7 ah might just be my end then
[3:16:43] <+IHATREID> mans loves jumping, hates 2h
[3:16:58] <+MisterArcanine> in Woolie's defense Nago at 20% health is 100% of Reggie's health
[3:17:08] <+skylerpilot> could woolie have killed there by going ham with the blood meter?
[3:17:41] <pmmori> what song is this
[3:17:56] <user_naim> man against millia that bite heal is not insignificant
[3:17:59] <dandy_bones> Break a Spell
[3:18:02] <pmmori> ty
[3:18:15] <mikeyjay47> cali burst
[3:19:11] <+MisterArcanine> Reggie's blue RCs look so dirty
[3:19:25] <andre11dr> That delayed burst was actually kinda insane
[3:19:34] <+TechnoSyndrome> reggie you gotta combo into angel super in the corner man
[3:19:34] <roz_en> So I picked up may for the first time today, and WHAT THE FUCK THIS IS SO EASY
[3:19:38] <+Prinny_Raider> why does woolie do 623H after 214H on block?
[3:19:43] <%Sparkseid> Reggie...
[3:19:58] <NotHereToStream> @Prinny_Raider to catch reggie if he presses a button
[3:20:04] <user_naim> mistakes were made, but it happens
[3:20:24] <+Prinny_Raider> @NotHereToStream has he been catching reggie with that? I just tuned in
[3:20:26] <andre11dr> His poping
[3:20:32] <zenith0111> @roz_en They took out half her old kit which was more setup based and made he rpurely about dolphin now
[3:20:38] <NotHereToStream> @Prinny_Raider sometimes yes
[3:21:49] <roz_en> @zenith0111 Dolphin and air H is so busted. Coming off of I-no, its like I'm on easy mode.
[3:21:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:21:58] <user_naim> Now that is Cali fucking burst
[3:22:05] <+Prinny_Raider> I can't believe woolie recovered in time from that whiffed 3rd swing
[3:22:09] <+MisterArcanine> Worst part of fighting Nago is if you burst late in last round you ain't getting that shit back
[3:22:23] <andre11dr> You keep canceling the sweep move into backdash that's like half blood gauge for a bait
[3:22:30] <andre11dr> It is not worth
[3:22:53] <user_naim> And yet
[3:22:53] <zenith0111> Getting level 2 blood is good tho
[3:23:18] <+IHATREID> the atmosphere of these fights feel like Reggie is that really good friend who wants his other friend to have fun but other friend is really competitive
[3:23:30] <+MisterArcanine> yeah most Nagos purposely go a little ham to hover around level 2
[3:23:37] <andre11dr> Yeah but then Millia is running around and he has to just sit there
[3:24:12] <zenith0111> Level 2 Blood Starters do his best combos I think
[3:24:41] <andre11dr> Level 2 is good in general
[3:24:49] <roz_en> Yeah, level 2 blood is when he becomes real. Level 3 also in some cases
[3:24:52] <andre11dr> Gets better hitboxes
[3:25:09] <%Takreth> that jab is so fast
[3:26:04] <user_naim> Nago’s jab is 5f right
[3:26:11] <%itsmostlynick> Pretty sure.
[3:26:12] <mikeyjay47> shoulda just supered
[3:26:27] <Bennett_Fracture> what you two think of the new street of rage dlc...
[3:26:34] <Bennett_Fracture> do you plan on playing co-op...
[3:26:36] <roz_en> Most jabs are 5 frames if I remember right
[3:26:45] <K1llingEdge> i hope they do
[3:26:49] <K1llingEdge> shiva so fun
[3:26:53] <Bennett_Fracture> would be fun...
[3:26:57] <mikeyjay47> gio has 4 frame jab
[3:26:58] <user_naim> Gio has 4f I think?
[3:26:59] <Bennett_Fracture> for fun sake...
[3:27:00] <zenith0111> Millia doesnt have a 5 frame I thought
[3:27:01] <user_naim> I gotta check
[3:27:11] <%Sypheck> Millia's fastest is 6f
[3:27:17] <%Sypheck> 2K and 2P
[3:27:26] <zenith0111> oof shes as fast as Axl?
[3:27:41] <%Sypheck> yeah she's not great at getting out of pressure
[3:27:46] <andre11dr> Yeah character have different speed on jabs
[3:27:50] <%Sypheck> thats why she has a hard time dealing with Nago's beyblade
[3:28:00] <%Sypheck> its +0 at worst she can't contest a grab
[3:28:09] <bevyrage> isn't her jump and air dash fast though?
[3:28:10] <andre11dr> I think 4 frames is the best it gets
[3:28:15] <%bmoral64> bmoral64 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:28:26] <NotHereToStream> Sol laughs with 3f 5K
[3:28:28] <%Sypheck> chipp and sol have 3F normals
[3:28:30] <%kotl7> 3 frames for chipp
[3:28:32] <zenith0111> @bevyrage Yes but Nago has one of the best AAs in the game
[3:28:37] <%kotl7> his 5p
[3:28:38] <bevyrage> ah makes sense then
[3:28:38] <roz_en> Yeah, its either 3 or 4 with Chipp and Sol
[3:28:43] <dandy_bones> Does Millia have any meterless reversals?
[3:28:47] <%Sypheck> no
[3:28:49] <andre11dr> Ok so 3 frames is the best it gets
[3:28:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[3:28:50] <zenith0111> Chipps hit high tho and Sols 5k is 3 frame at Point Blank
[3:29:07] <andre11dr> @dandy_bones No
[3:29:12] <zenith0111> Otherwise 5k is like 8?
[3:29:12] <%kotl7> yeah they have limitations, I often whiff 5p on crouchers
[3:29:13] <user_naim> Well to be fair, Sol definitely needs a 3f move as part of his kit. He would be so incomplete otherwise
[3:29:20] <dandy_bones> Thought so
[3:29:25] <user_naim> It’s like his one strength
[3:29:40] <+chrollo_riz> Thats just not true lol
[3:29:42] <roz_en> Fr fr, Sol be lackin in tools
[3:29:44] <%kotl7> then my HP bar disappears in a flash but it's fine lol
[3:29:54] <roz_en> I winced as I typed that BTW
[3:29:58] <user_naim> @roz_en I know right?
[3:30:04] <%kotl7> LUL
[3:30:05] <user_naim> My teeth hurt
[3:30:13] <JetpackMcQuack> no :)
[3:30:16] <stanlychicken> sol has the lowest damage supers in the game lol
[3:30:28] <%kotl7> oh no what will he do
[3:30:36] <andre11dr> Nah Heavy Mob is fine
[3:30:42] <Hirumm> does Woolie finally have Reggie downloaded?
[3:30:57] <bevyrage> i don't think the download has been unpacked fully
[3:30:57] <+chrollo_riz> Lower than Ky?
[3:31:12] <user_naim> To be actually honest, I don’t even get many Sols, but if I have permissiom to compalin about a character, I will take it
[3:31:22] <zenith0111> Ky is the second most used character online
[3:31:24] <user_naim> Feels so good to whine
[3:31:27] <zenith0111> statistically
[3:31:46] <andre11dr> I get so many Sol mirrors i think i learned it more than most matchups
[3:31:46] <+IHATREID> ok but who has the best theme tho??
[3:31:57] <+chrollo_riz> Are there a lot of Mays on NA? I've only fought like 3 total in EU
[3:32:06] <dandy_bones> I-No
[3:32:06] <zenith0111> Sol players take up around 25% pf the total playerbase...
[3:32:08] <%LordSDB> Its between Ky, Milia and May
[3:32:08] <+MisterArcanine> I think Ky gets downplayed a lot, he's honest but he will fuck you up
[3:32:10] <bevyrage> no lie i'm really feeling goldlewis' theme
[3:32:10] <roz_en> @user_naim Neither do I, but Sol players seem to actively avoid any unorthodox characters
[3:32:22] <Hirumm> I'm so sorry Woolie
[3:32:38] <user_naim> @roz_en who do you play? I’m one of those scrub Gios
[3:32:54] <andre11dr> I fight a lot of Sol ,a lot of Gio ,a lot of Pot
[3:33:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> have the warriors appeared today
[3:33:16] <NotHereToStream> can't wait for goldlewis
[3:33:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> did we have any unga bungas
[3:33:23] <andre11dr> Apparently Gio is just really popular in Europe
[3:33:27] <zenith0111> In this Behemoth Typhoon
[3:33:36] <bevyrage> sol and may?

[3:33:38] <user_naim> @andre11dr we have good taste
[3:33:41] <roz_en> @user_naim I play I-no mainly.
[3:33:53] <user_naim> @roz_en ahh, cool
[3:33:59] <+IHATREID> ky in general has good tools and neutral but at a high level just cant compare to other characters thats all
[3:34:05] <andre11dr> I wanna learn I-No
[3:34:18] <bevyrage> strive is probably the best place to learn i-no
[3:34:19] <%kotl7> I hope there's a mod in the future where Goldlewis just says "in THIS behemoth typhoon" everytime he does this behemoth typhoon
[3:34:22] <zenith0111> Ky gets punished for landing a fireball
[3:34:25] <+SkaiVibration> I-No is super fun
[3:34:30] <+SkaiVibration> she's tough tho
[3:34:34] <bevyrage> @kotl7 that mod is gonna be out day 1 for sure
[3:34:36] <andre11dr> Never played her in the prior games but her design is so cool
[3:34:38] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[3:34:38] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 2 minutes
[3:34:44] <bevyrage> gonna see it on octopimp's channel within minutes
[3:34:46] <+diobestwaifu> Damn how long have they been going at it, 2 hours?
[3:34:54] <bevyrage> 4 hours
[3:34:54] <%Lion_kun> 4 hrs
[3:34:56] <%Sparkseid> shoulda been for glory!
[3:34:56] <user_naim> That slow sheathe of Nago’s sword is so good
[3:34:58] <%kotl7> @bevyrage woolieMINHMAX
[3:35:00] <+chrollo_riz> @andre11dr In my last 400 games I've had 50 Rams, Gios and Milla. They're the big 3 in EU
[3:35:24] <andre11dr> Oh yeah Ive seen some Ram
[3:35:37] <%kotl7> @andre11dr I second that
[3:35:45] <roz_en> I-no can be rough, her tools aren't as immediately rewarding as a lot of the cast
[3:35:49] <andre11dr> Ram is so good when she gets the corner
[3:35:52] <user_naim> My first 50 wins badge was against Ky in EU. Floors 7/8 mainly
[3:35:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:35:54] <bevyrage> not as many rams as xrd but still high in number
[3:35:56] <+SkaiVibration> looooool
[3:36:01] <+SkaiVibration> the godlike strats
[3:36:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[3:36:03] <%Sparkseid> WOW
[3:36:03] <Meltgar> WOOLIE NOOO
[3:36:03] <Hydrapissed> THAT RISK GAUGE
[3:36:05] <Meltgar> LUL
[3:36:06] <Hydrapissed> was BLINKING
[3:36:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> why woolie
[3:36:12] <%Lion_kun> Nago is so trash lol
[3:36:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> WHY DID YOU DO IT
[3:36:16] <user_naim> LUL LUL
[3:36:17] <NotHereToStream> scrambles are always funny
[3:36:28] <%Lion_kun> Just wait and he kills himself lol;
[3:36:42] <NotHereToStream> you can fast rc that throw into a 5c.S woolie
[3:36:42] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Lion_kun Go watch Fame96 play Nago and say that again
[3:36:43] <andre11dr> Like people are complaining about Sols far S ,but Rams Fae S is just as ridiculous
[3:36:57] <roz_en> Woolie fired not realizing there was one in the chamber
[3:37:05] <zenith0111> Ram can lose her Far Slash tho
[3:37:11] <zenith0111> and get a shitty version
[3:37:19] <%Sparkseid> no oxygen
[3:37:25] <user_naim> That round was a mystery
[3:37:36] <roz_en> Ram can't spam far S and have it be the best option for 90% of the match
[3:37:38] <+chrollo_riz> Only thing I hate about Ram is the super
[3:37:42] <user_naim> We can strike that from the record
[3:38:03] <+Pat_Squared> ram far slash also doesn't get you a whole lot outside of corner or RC's
[3:38:03] <+chrollo_riz> It's probably because I can't safe jump but dying in two insta reversals is so depressing
[3:38:06] <%Killah772> Killah772 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Ayyy we back in baby
[3:38:08] <bevyrage> okay i think this is the download being unpacked
[3:38:09] <%BoxNavy> woolie is dialed the fuck in
[3:38:12] <bevyrage> woolie moving in?
[3:38:17] <andre11dr> @zenith0111 Yeah but once you get to higher floors, people aren't throwing swords at random anymore
[3:38:22] <%kotl7> nice
[3:38:38] <zenith0111> @andre11dr Thats why YRCs and Bursts hurt them a lot
[3:38:44] <mikeyjay47> @pat_squared if she gets you in the corner you lost
[3:39:15] <+SkaiVibration> b
[3:39:17] <roz_en> Ram in the corner turns the game into DBFZ for the next 30 seconds
[3:39:17] <bevyrage> it just hit me, does reggie play millia because of her literal bird up super?
[3:39:29] <%kotl7> LUL
[3:39:30] <andre11dr> Can we take a moment and appreciate that Elephant is not in this game
[3:39:35] <%Killah772> woolieSMUG
[3:39:37] <andre11dr> Thank the lords
[3:39:38] <+chrollo_riz> yet
[3:39:40] <bevyrage> y'mean velvet?
[3:39:44] <user_naim> @andre11dr I’ll take a whole day
[3:39:56] <user_naim> And I barely played the old games
[3:40:26] <+Pat_Squared> @mikeyjay47 oh yeah no for sure thats where she's scariest. But like midscreen, F.S into H.S will just kinda hit you and generally not award a whole lot. Or you block it...or she whiffs
[3:40:32] <Meltgar> From all the game, who has the FASTEST close S?
[3:40:50] <Meltgar> I feel that everyone beats Faust close S
[3:40:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:40:58] <+Pat_Squared> its mainly just like an annoying thing, at least I find player her
[3:41:32] <andre11dr> Wasn't Bikens S godlike in +R
[3:41:47] <mikeyjay47> @andre11dr big time
[3:41:52] <roz_en> It's gonna be REAL funny if she gets back in.
[3:41:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> *pops blood *dies
[3:41:59] <%Lion_kun> anyone keeping track of the score?
[3:42:00] <user_naim> Hair saw to the dick
[3:42:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> there must be a connection somewhere
[3:42:18] <%kotl7> damn he's angry
[3:42:19] <+chrollo_riz> @Lion_kun It shows it on the victory screen boss
[3:42:29] <mikeyjay47> @andre11dr baiken was just broken in +r
[3:42:30] <%Lion_kun> tx, I didn't know that
[3:42:36] <user_naim> We do have a couple of resets tho right
[3:42:47] <Hirumm> I think we had one
[3:42:47] <user_naim> They fixed some techincal issues or something
[3:43:04] <%kotl7> it was pretty early tho
[3:43:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:43:06] <bevyrage> @Meltgar looking at the frame data and faust is on the slow end alongside axl for close s
[3:43:13] <user_naim> oh okay
[3:43:14] <bevyrage> 8 frames
[3:43:22] <+chrollo_riz> And thank god
[3:43:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I believe you reggie
[3:43:27] <andre11dr> Oh yeah Biken was like the best caracter in +R
[3:43:27] <zenith0111> Thats because Faust is technically a zoner
[3:43:33] <roz_en> @bevyrage There is no character named "Faust" in this game tho?
[3:43:40] <+chrollo_riz> If Axl had a good c.s I would uninstall
[3:43:43] <%Zero_Jacks> Oh shit reggie GAMING
[3:43:46] <andre11dr> She just got to play around the mechanics of the game
[3:43:48] <bevyrage> uh
[3:43:52] <zenith0111> @chrollo_riz Then uninstall
[3:43:53] <%bmoral64> @andre11dr I think you're forgetting about Testament and Justice
[3:43:59] <+SkaiVibration> the timing is jsut tough
[3:44:07] <coracor> is it 3f?
[3:44:11] <+SkaiVibration> backdash buffer is 3 I think
[3:44:11] <andre11dr> And then they made her trash in +R
[3:44:13] <%Mathochism> @WoolieVersus Timing is rough. 3 frame window.
[3:44:16] <+SkaiVibration> It's fuckin small
[3:44:18] <andre11dr> I mean Xrd
[3:44:31] <andre11dr> They made her trash in Xrd
[3:44:52] <reddpop_> Woolie is looking so much more confident in his play. love to see it
[3:44:54] <mikeyjay47> baiken was good after they buffed her in rev2
[3:44:54] <LorcaNomad> I feel like woolie should try 5d when he has reggie on wakeup
[3:45:10] <andre11dr> @bmoral64 Yeah those caracter where broken in different ways
[3:45:14] <LorcaNomad> reggie seems to like crouchblock on wakeup
[3:45:14] <%BoxNavy> no...
[3:45:20] <bevyrage> oh hey
[3:45:55] <andre11dr> Testament filled the screen with shit had crazy oki game, and some good ass normals and Zappa...
[3:45:58] <bevyrage> @Meltgar i found someone who's got a slower close s than faust, axl, and pot: zato-1 with 9 frame startup
[3:46:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[3:46:07] <@Moobot> @sonofthedeepsouth WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 14 minutes
[3:46:09] <bevyrage> everyone else has 7
[3:46:10] <andre11dr> Zappa was just a mistake
[3:46:12] <Meltgar> Geezus, poor guys
[3:46:37] <user_naim> @bevyrage oh I didn’t even know it was that slow. Thx
[3:46:44] <bevyrage> no prob
[3:46:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> 24h Strive stream wehn?!
[3:46:59] <zenith0111> @user_naim Well that Zatos gimmick. He sucks without Eddie
[3:47:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> No I don't care after hour 13 he will play like ass
[3:47:07] <user_naim> I need to spend a whole day on dustloop
[3:47:23] <user_naim> @zenith0111 it does make sense now that i think about it
[3:47:29] <zenith0111> To qoute Kizzie kay:"Fuck dustloop"
[3:47:32] <andre11dr> If they bring Zappa back i hope they keep the +R version of sword, at least just for a week
[3:47:39] <BackwardCap> 1 round, 3 walls gildedDerp
[3:47:47] <andre11dr> Y'all need to experience that shit
[3:47:49] <bevyrage> that's the ultimate fomo
[3:47:53] <%kotl7> @andre11dr no please, I still don't understand how it works
[3:47:58] <bevyrage> this character is only going to be busted for 1 week
[3:48:02] <%kotl7> it's terrifying
[3:48:22] <andre11dr> Complaining that Sol is broken, let Zappa overhead you from full screen
[3:48:48] <andre11dr> AND get full combo that can't be bursted
[3:48:49] <Hirumm> NotLikeThis
[3:48:49] <Rawbone_saw> ggs, im really feelin it
[3:48:54] <+SkaiVibration> Sol IS broken
[3:48:57] <andre11dr> FOR LIKE 40%
[3:49:00] <+SkaiVibration> but not as broken as prev gg demons
[3:49:16] <bevyrage> bird up!
[3:49:18] <%kotl7> no please make it stop, sometimes it's a low I can't deal with that!!!
[3:49:31] <user_naim> So we’ve entered the ”Why” stage of the set
[3:49:42] <bevyrage> looks it
[3:49:42] <JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis
[3:49:56] <mikeyjay47> woolie getting tilted
[3:50:00] <zenith0111> Videogames have taught us to recognize patterns but in fighting games people use that against you all the time
[3:50:01] <AgnusLaplace> reggie really is gaming
[3:50:07] <+diobestwaifu> Whats everyones thoughts on Goldlewis?
[3:50:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:50:22] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[3:50:30] <LorcaNomad> nice
[3:50:31] <bevyrage> i showed goldlewis to a friend who wants to get into fighting games but never had a character who spoke to 'em, and they went WHAT GAME IS THIS
[3:50:40] <%kotl7> @diobestwaifu in THIS behemoth typhoon kinda thoughts
[3:50:41] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:50:46] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:50:48] <user_naim> The old ”why the fuck did I do that” hour of the night
[3:50:51] <zenith0111> Just block Millia 4Head
[3:50:53] <%Sparkseid> The unmixing is taxing
[3:51:05] <user_naim> @diobestwaifu Behemoth Typhoon is going to confuse me for weeks
[3:51:09] <%kotl7> oof
[3:51:11] <user_naim> he’s cool tho
[3:51:11] <%BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[3:51:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Just block that Unblockable LMAO
[3:51:20] <LorcaNomad> woolie went off this round PogChamp
[3:51:29] <bevyrage> i at least appreciate that the direction of the behemoth typhoon matches the direction he swings it
[3:51:29] <Rawbone_saw> it's rough! yea
[3:51:31] <%kotl7> ULTRAAAAAA
[3:51:34] <bevyrage> imagine if they didn't line up
[3:51:36] <bevyrage> that'd be the worst
[3:51:57] <user_naim> @bevyrage that’d be funky for sure
[3:52:19] <andre11dr> Yeah i imagine it's hard to fight Millia without a DP
[3:52:30] <Rawbone_saw> that was always my favorite part of fighting games with friends, they KNOW you they KNOW KNOW you
[3:52:50] <+0dinpen> first time seeing woolie and reggie play each other
[3:52:53] <zenith0111> @andre11dr Depends. Like for Axl she struggles getting in compared to the other cast
[3:53:03] <+diobestwaifu> Fighting ransoms who know your character and fighting friends who know YOU are wildly different experiences
[3:53:16] <zenith0111> Even Gaust can give her a harder time do to his big normals and teleports
[3:53:20] <%kotl7> @Rawbone_saw hope you played KI with them, it's one if not the best game for that kinda feel
[3:53:21] <zenith0111> Faust*
[3:53:24] <%jolene_orenji> @Rawbone_saw love being 30 matches in with my friends and doing shit that would NEVER work but ends up landing because we've been doing nothing but conditioning eachother with dumb bullshit for 4 hours
[3:53:30] <+SkaiVibration> loooool
[3:53:38] <+SkaiVibration> not even a problem
[3:53:56] <Rawbone_saw> beating my dad's ivy in SC2 was just so amazing, all of a sudden it just clicked. once i got in, he had nothing, keeping me away was his whole plan
[3:54:31] <Meltgar> Sometimes i hit stuff on GG that i SHOULDN'T
[3:54:34] <+DynDimAcsiwn> @Rawbone_saw same experience with my Dad's Law in Tekken 2
[3:54:36] <Rawbone_saw> but ppl who /actually/ know what their doing are so much more enjoyable than that
[3:54:38] <Meltgar> I even call it out "I did NOT hit that"
[3:54:52] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Rawbone_saw that would make a sick fighting game manga
[3:55:04] <user_naim> Oh yeah friends 20 matches in let you get away with murder
[3:55:14] <user_naim> but it goes both ways of course
[3:55:14] <andre11dr> At least the matches are more even now
[3:55:29] <andre11dr> At first Woolie was looking kinda free
[3:55:55] <zenith0111> Woolie is ahead
[3:55:55] <Rawbone_saw> @Rawbone_saw oh we went hard on tekken2 i love my trashboi alex
[3:55:56] <Meltgar> W 19 - 28 R
[3:56:08] <mikeyjay47> cali burst
[3:56:09] <bakkatohri> When is Bridget coming back
[3:56:13] <zenith0111> Oh my bad
[3:56:30] <Meltgar> Bridget was a fan pick on REV 2 right?
[3:56:31] <Rawbone_saw> @Rawbone_saw u are not even wrong, oh man.
[3:56:31] <NotHereToStream> this gonna end being a ft100
[3:56:42] <Meltgar> *favourite pick
[3:56:44] <roz_en> @andre11dr Woolie started taking risk instead of trying for safe options.
[3:56:52] <roz_en> "Safe" I should say
[3:56:52] <AgnusLaplace> @bakkatohri I admire your faith
[3:56:57] <andre11dr> Every time they pull a wack burst take a shot
[3:57:06] <zenith0111> Bridget was also used for sexual comedic gags with Johnny who confused him for a little girl... SeemsGood
[3:57:06] <insertedgynamehere___> Hello there
[3:57:11] <SunsetJack> I wonder if he could have RC to extend and win with that combo/

[3:57:48] <bakkatohri> Anybody else got a thing where they won't play a fighting game if their main isn't included? Because I'm not playing GG until Bridget comes back.

[3:59:46] <zenith0111> @mikeyjay47 But its not like im evenly spread on everyone one. I have 250+ hours on Axl but I still play the cast
[4:00:37] <andre11dr> This is hour 2 ,this shit has definitely become woolieGLORY
[4:00:58] <+0dinpen> beating up woolie (for fun)
[4:01:09] <%kotl7> woolieKICKDAD
[4:01:13] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> God i'm getting angry at millia just by watching this
[4:01:13] <user_naim> The Reggie Vs show
[4:01:16] <jemeralddragoon> @zenith0111 sounds like you got a main to me
[4:01:16] <+0dinpen> sajamVibe
[4:01:18] <user_naim> Get him a promo code
[4:01:35] <mikeyjay47> woolie always challenges at the weirdest moments
[4:01:40] <zenith0111> @jemeralddragoon I do LUL I dont understand what im saying thats confusing you guys
[4:01:44] <roz_en> I want to play more may but I'm scared. She gets so much shit for free that I-no has to put in mad work to get
[4:01:51] <andre11dr> @angra_malnyu Don't worry, she dies in 3 hits
[4:02:00] <+chrollo_riz> RIP
[4:02:03] <andre11dr> But you gotta land those
[4:02:03] <jemeralddragoon> @zenith0111 i'm just poking fun at you
[4:02:17] <Meltgar> @roz_en just play the characters you like, ain't noone putting a gun to your head
[4:02:22] <+diobestwaifu> They say if they doing park matches today?
[4:02:26] <zenith0111> All im basically saying is even though I have a main im not a scrub and I still play the cast for fun
[4:02:27] <Meltgar> Sure, people will hate you for playing her tho' Kappa
[4:02:51] <roz_en> I can feel the hair growing on my back
[4:03:04] <user_naim> People will hate you every character
[4:03:10] <Meltgar> @zenith0111 It's weird how i played EVERYONE in XX2, but in strive? Oh god i don't know anymore
[4:03:13] <roz_en> I am.. returning to monke
[4:03:25] <user_naim> sea monke

[4:04:03] <user_naim> @andre11dr that might be the one exception
[4:04:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah, people hate losing haha
[4:04:31] <andre11dr> Honestly that's how fighting games should be
[4:04:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:04:41] <Meltgar> I play nago like trash, but it's step by step with learning
[4:04:44] <andre11dr> Everyone is broken in different ways
[4:04:47] <Meltgar> Gio is my 2nd in "Try to main" too
[4:04:55] <%fizzguy47> Can you not follow up after haircar?
[4:05:09] <zenith0111> Haircar would be busted of she could
[4:05:11] <%fizzguy47> @meltgar Gio is fun
[4:05:13] <Rawbone_saw> lmao "fair enough"
[4:05:50] <+QueenOfSpoopy> LUL
[4:05:53] <user_naim> Sajam said this is a game for making angry decisions, and even if he was joking, I do kind of feel it
[4:05:53] <andre11dr> I tried to play Gio
[4:05:53] <+0dinpen> i think hair car followups are only with rc
[4:06:03] <andre11dr> She's just nit interesting to me
[4:06:08] <zenith0111> BRC making everything so unsafe
[4:06:12] <heart_raid_> yeah you need meter to follow up hair car
[4:06:19] <%Sparkseid> nope
[4:06:23] <andre11dr> She's a great design but not great gameplay
[4:06:26] <HotSauceFiend> so are both reggie and woolie at the top of the rankings yet?
[4:06:35] <user_naim> rip
[4:06:36] <+RichHoboInVegas> you could follow up haircar if it's counterhit also
[4:06:38] <+0dinpen> gio fun for me
[4:06:40] <+countgaculatv> I think they're both Celestial
[4:06:45] <+0dinpen> i just pressure to death
[4:07:06] <heart_raid_> yeah forgot about counter hit my b
[4:07:17] <gyrobasel> is woolie gonna atleast try goldlewis when he comes out or is he just gonna stick to his boring "only one character i find cool" thing
[4:07:20] <andre11dr> I'm just kind disappointed that she's just a kick girl
[4:07:37] <andre11dr> And the dog might as well be just a scarf
[4:07:41] <zenith0111> Ignore the fact she waves her hair like a rock concert
[4:07:44] <NotHereToStream> everyone wanted her to use her doggo
[4:07:53] <+DynDimAcsiwn> Gio being a kick girl has me interested tbh, I think she's cool but I cannot wrap my head around puppet characters
[4:08:08] <zenith0111> Millias a headbanger I realized LUL
[4:08:13] <user_naim> @andre11dr a kick assisting scarf, but i get what you mean. I’m happy she’s not a Zato type tho
[4:08:23] <$cherubs_anonymous> @DynDimAcsiwn Gio isn't puppet at all, the dog is just there
[4:08:24] <+countgaculatv> @gyrobasel It's not bad to wanna stick with one character. Some people aren't good at learning another character and sometimes learning someone else makes you lose what you know originally
[4:08:26] <AgnusLaplace> @DynDimAcsiwn the dog is not a puppet, it's a decoration
[4:08:26] <gyrobasel> they should've canned giovana and brought back aba instead
[4:08:41] <user_naim> @gyrobasel how dare you
[4:08:45] <andre11dr> I guess i wanted her to be more like Bridget than Zato
[4:08:49] <+DynDimAcsiwn> yeah that's what I'm saying. I'm saying I am now interested because she is not a puppet character
[4:08:54] <zenith0111> Y'all didnt actually want the dog playable
[4:09:00] <andre11dr> like throw dog out and go in
[4:09:11] <zenith0111> If you wanted a puppet character youd be playing zato but youre not
[4:09:15] <%kotl7> nah just more dog moves
[4:09:21] <zenith0111> So shut it about the dog
[4:09:23] <%kotl7> like in her air super
[4:09:41] <+chrollo_riz> As long as I can call full bar Shrek install I'm happy
[4:09:42] <jemeralddragoon> fuck that, i want to play as Ramlethal's dog
[4:09:47] <$cherubs_anonymous> @zenith0111 You don't gotta be rude
[4:09:47] <user_naim> Dog fireball maybe, but she needs a weakness, so I get why not
[4:10:12] <user_naim> I’m happier with Gio having a god tier dash but no projectile
[4:10:20] <andre11dr> Maybe like a dog stance or something
[4:10:23] <zenith0111> @cherubs_anonymous Not meant to be so serious but given your reaction I guess theres a pang of truth to my claim
[4:10:28] <Meltgar> DOG DLC?! Hell yeah Kappa
[4:10:54] <AgnusLaplace> I just want instant kills back
[4:11:04] <jemeralddragoon> i was kind of hoping Giovanna would play like Ken/Koromaru in P4AU but I like her the way she is
[4:11:05] <user_naim> Dog instant kill then
[4:11:06] <aura_00> @AgnusLaplace same man
[4:11:07] <%kotl7> Gio's dog as its own character would be cool woolieSHOOK
[4:11:08] <user_naim> solved
[4:11:30] <andre11dr> Yo Rams dog tag teaming with Gio dog? IM IN
[4:11:42] <%kotl7> double dog character is even better, you're right
[4:11:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:11:46] <jemeralddragoon> @andre11dr all the fingers will be bitten
[4:12:03] <+chrollo_riz> Its weird that the dog possesses her when she Shreks out but her moveset doesn't change
[4:12:06] <user_naim> @andre11dr Gio’s dog doing the sweep with Ram’s dog on top of its leg
[4:12:10] <BaslerJones> just got the game, have no idea which character to main PogChamp
[4:12:17] <%kotl7> call them "Dog Tag" or smth
[4:12:34] <zenith0111> He a good boy and only do kicks :) no biting
[4:12:36] <jemeralddragoon> @BaslerJones try out everyone and just find the one that really speaks to you
[4:12:36] <andre11dr> We need to send this shit to Daisuke
[4:12:52] <AgnusLaplace> @BaslerJones whichever you think looks the coolest, never failed for me
[4:12:57] <BaslerJones> the worst part is that i like everyone in guilty gear lmao
[4:12:59] <+AmanDotZip> lmfao i swear
[4:13:06] <user_naim> Write this down for the next backyard
[4:13:13] <bevyrage> just play everyone then
[4:13:19] <+countgaculatv> @BaslerJones How do you usually play a fighting game?
[4:13:26] <%kotl7> Backyard 2: the Dogs chapter
[4:13:42] <andre11dr> @baslerjones Maybe try Sol ,i hear his an ok caracter
[4:13:43] <+countgaculatv> Who Let the Dogs Out 2: Bullshit Blazing
[4:13:47] <zenith0111> Yeah like honestly play them all and rotate how you feel
[4:13:52] <$cherubs_anonymous> @BaslerJones What gameplay archetype do you gravitate to?
[4:13:54] <user_naim> Screw fixing the lobbies, let’s get a Pupper budget
[4:13:57] <%kotl7> @countgaculatv woolieKICKDAD
[4:13:58] <+EcchiRider> @BaslerJones I've played Gio > Anji > Sol now I'm learning Axl. just play who peaks your interest at the moment
[4:14:02] <BaslerJones> @countgaculatv ah it varies, I guess I like character that hit hard relies on counters
[4:14:04] <zenith0111> I think most people main way too much anyways before learning the game
[4:14:19] <NotHereToStream> at the end of the day, we are all goldlewis mains
[4:14:22] <zenith0111> im like bro, the game not even out and you know your main
[4:14:26] <jemeralddragoon> @BaslerJones I found I like playing Millia because she plays alot like Filia from Skullgirls and she's my main in Skullgirls
[4:14:39] <+countgaculatv> @BaslerJones Sounds like you want Ram or May.
[4:14:39] <BaslerJones> I main Baiken in GGXX, Makoto in 3s, Necallin in SFV, Oni in SF4
[4:14:40] <andre11dr> I do want to have multiple mains, i usually do in
[4:14:58] <user_naim> Which Behemoth Typhoon do you main @notheretostream ?
[4:15:08] <andre11dr> I mean if they ad Slayer i will have multiple mains anyway
[4:15:08] <+EcchiRider> @BaslerJones if you like Baiken you might like how anji plays here
[4:15:15] <%jolene_orenji> @user_naim in this behemoth typhoon...
[4:15:19] <NotHereToStream> @user_naim ALL
[4:15:29] <$cherubs_anonymous> @BaslerJones Nago might be up your alley
[4:15:31] <zenith0111> Cant wait to type in 47896HS for behemoth typhoon. Thanks numpad notation NotLikeThis
[4:15:36] <user_naim> Goldlick Dewinson commits a fucking crime
[4:15:48] <%kotl7> @NotHereToStream cmon dude share the pizza
[4:15:51] <bevyrage> goldlewis kills a man
[4:15:54] <zenith0111> or 89632 NotLikeThis
[4:15:57] <BaslerJones> @BaslerJones I thought about him
[4:16:13] <+EcchiRider> I wish tha alien dragged you into the coffin and sent you to the shadow realm
[4:16:21] <+chrollo_riz> I can barely do I-Nos cmd grab, I aint about to make half circles my entire neutral
[4:16:34] <andre11dr> But yeah in Xrd i played Slayer, i played Sol ,i played Raven and Jack-
[4:16:35] <zenith0111> The Alien is meant to be a secret which what I feel people kinda ignore
[4:16:40] <NotHereToStream> @kotl7 you can have the crusts
[4:16:43] <+DynDimAcsiwn> no need to type the diagonals with half circles. The lack of 5 inputs implies it's a fluid
[4:16:49] <bevyrage> to be fair it's not your entire neutral @chrollo_riz it's also mid-combo and your link
[4:17:28] <SunsetJack> That can't be +8. It should be more.
[4:17:38] <+chrollo_riz> I'm just not NA enough for him
[4:17:48] <andre11dr> Man i hope they as Jack-O i usually don't like the cute waifu caracter but...there's just something about Jack-O
[4:17:53] <%kotl7> @NotHereToStream I'll just steal THIS behemoth typhoon and run away!
[4:17:54] <zenith0111> 862 into 486
[4:18:05] <andre11dr> Or i guess it would be Aria
[4:18:13] <bevyrage> @andre11dr hate to break it to yah but story wise we won't be seeing jack-o anytime soo- damn you beat me to it
[4:18:20] <%kotl7> you won't even know which one it is! AHAHAHA!
[4:18:28] <NotHereToStream> @kotl7 you may, but i will use that orbital laser super to get you
[4:18:34] <+chrollo_riz> wat? Shes still Jack O
[4:18:34] <+chief_chongo> jacko-o will play differently right...?
[4:18:42] <bevyrage> nah it'd be aria for sure
[4:18:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:18:51] <+DynDimAcsiwn> what happened to that not in bed man they teased?
[4:19:03] <PunishedMercer_> it's jack-o, just the mature personality. aria's dormant.
[4:19:12] <zenith0111> @chrollo_riz Its complicated but basically its Arias reincarnation with the old soul and new soul
[4:19:14] <bevyrage> if she loses the moba gimmick i am legit interested in what her theme would be
[4:19:24] <+chief_chongo> in the strive story aria stays dormant and basically tells JackO to live her life IIRC
[4:19:29] <%kotl7> @NotHereToStream lmoa how is orbital laser pressure real, like just FD away from the laser
[4:19:29] <andre11dr> If Aria gets an Install that is just the old AC broken version for like 15 seconds count me in
[4:19:31] <zenith0111> Which then become their own person at the end of strive
[4:19:44] <LorcaNomad> @DynDimAcsiwn happy chaos? he'll probably be character 3 or 4 on the dlc
[4:19:49] <+chrollo_riz> I watched the story, Aria basically just fucked off so she can be Jack O forever
[4:20:03] <+DynDimAcsiwn> @DynDimAcsiwn oh ok cool
[4:20:06] <zenith0111> Thats the old and new soul coming together
[4:20:14] <NotHereToStream> @kotl7 it tracks right? even in security level 3 it pushes the opponent towards lewis
[4:20:18] <user_naim> Woolie shaking
[4:20:20] <zenith0111> Eastern writing tropes and what not
[4:20:25] <+chief_chongo> i didn't get how JackO was tryna fuse with I-No tho
[4:20:26] <SunsetJack> Chaos might be a spin off of Jack-O gameplay probably.
[4:20:34] <+chief_chongo> That was what she did to Justice so why more fusing..?
[4:20:48] <zenith0111> @chief_chongo Because the backyeard and valentines are connected
[4:20:58] <%kotl7> @NotHereToStream it does iirc, not sure how FD will actually interact with it, probably just negate chip
[4:21:01] <andre11dr> I just want that dumb ass gameplay with the minions back
[4:21:06] <+megaman_sentinel> hands off that button lol
[4:21:08] <+chief_chongo> something about I-No being the magical foci of the backyard i guess
[4:21:09] <andre11dr> It was so stupid
[4:21:16] <andre11dr> I loved it
[4:21:22] <LorcaNomad> I want jack-o back so I can bully my friend who hates fighting her
[4:21:28] <+itsOnyxLeo> @chief_chongo Did you play Rev2? That's what she was made for
[4:21:42] <+itsOnyxLeo> If she could merge with Justice, she could merge with I-NO
[4:21:44] <user_naim> Man Guilty Gear is fucking great.
[4:21:59] <+chief_chongo> i played thru the arcades and story in Xrd and Rev2 but its starting to get fuzzy lol
[4:21:59] <andre11dr> Guilty Gear is fucking stupid
[4:22:05] <user_naim> true
[4:22:07] <andre11dr> But it's also really good
[4:22:08] <%kotl7> the duality of man
[4:22:09] <+Debuggingfool> who stage theme is this song?
[4:22:16] <LorcaNomad> guilty gear is the best
[4:22:16] <+itsOnyxLeo> it's the rev 2 intro
[4:22:21] <+chrollo_riz> Woolie not recapping the story mode of Strive is a war crime
[4:22:22] <zenith0111> Most fighting game lore is just bros chillin or dudes smack talkin. no inbetween
[4:22:31] <$cherubs_anonymous> @Debuggingfool It's Break A Spell, Rev 2 op theme
[4:22:35] <+chrollo_riz> What does he expect us to do, watch it ourselves?
[4:22:40] <+Debuggingfool> @cherubs_anonymous thanks
[4:22:56] <+fetrigon> they playing first to 50?
[4:22:57] <+diobestwaifu> Damn I guess theyre jsut going at it tonight
[4:23:02] <+chief_chongo> i watched all of woolie's vids and im still kinda like wut happened at the end of Strive lol
[4:23:02] <%TomAtlus> TomAtlus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! OOF, CLEAN
[4:23:11] <+chief_chongo> i was getting a bit drunk when i finished it I think
[4:23:12] <zenith0111> Woolie needed this set
[4:23:12] <+megaman_sentinel> clean
[4:23:17] <andre11dr> So chat, which new caracters do you want from the story?
[4:23:19] <+chief_chongo> i just remember Sol is Freddie now
[4:23:29] <+chief_chongo> guess us President Vernon and Gabriel
[4:23:35] <$cherubs_anonymous> @andre11dr Chaos and Asuka
[4:23:36] <+fetrigon> @andre11dr ram's thighs
[4:23:37] <andre11dr> Obviously one man with glasses but anyone ok
[4:23:37] <user_naim> @andre11dr That laser robot in the air vents
[4:23:38] <%RyTYoung> yo yo yo, how bad an idea is playing in the tower, drunk? Kappa
[4:23:45] <%fizzguy47> PC version shows separate button inputs for P1 and P2 on the options, damn
[4:23:56] <+megaman_sentinel> GG
[4:24:04] <%kotl7> @RyTYoung you're at risk of having EXTREME fun
[4:24:10] <%Tearonex> doodOne doodOne doodOne
[4:24:13] <zenith0111> @rytyoung Youre not a real FGC member unless you have some form of substance abuse to combat stress
[4:24:16] <+chrollo_riz> @andre11dr @andre11dr Daryl
[4:24:17] <+fetrigon> ok, a non-degenerate answer would be Justice
[4:24:23] <%RyTYoung> @kotl7 aight I'm grabbing my ethernet cable you've sold me!
[4:24:25] <andre11dr> Gabriel would be fuckin sick
[4:24:25] <BaslerJones> KYle Kisky really that bad in this game ?
[4:24:30] <%kotl7> LUL
[4:24:37] <%TomAtlus> Ky is only okay
[4:24:40] <%Sparkseid> sajamMash
[4:24:43] <%TomAtlus> Anji and Faust are the ones really struggling I think
[4:24:44] <bevyrage> he's the most honest he's ever been
[4:24:48] <+chief_chongo> President Vernon football Install
[4:24:54] <andre11dr> Ans Chaos seems like an obvious pick for the future
[4:24:54] <%kotl7> @RyTYoung glad I could help LUL
[4:24:56] <bevyrage> and this is a game with some real dirty plays
[4:25:04] <mikeyjay47> ky has tools for every situation but lacks in dirty shit
[4:25:06] <%RyTYoung> @zenith0111 that sounds about right LUL
[4:25:24] <%RyTYoung> @kotl7 your input was vital to my decision making LUL
[4:25:33] <%Sypheck> woolie needs to mash that double overhead if he knows he's abusing it
[4:25:37] <andre11dr> Infact i bet the next caracter they show is Chaos
[4:25:54] <+chief_chongo> they said the 2nd would be returning so Jam or Jack-o, right?
[4:25:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[4:25:58] <andre11dr> I MUST KILL CHAOS
[4:25:59] <+chrollo_riz> Next char is a returning char
[4:26:01] <%townzzzzz> YES
[4:26:06] <Rawbone_saw> YOOOOOOOOOO
[4:26:06] <%Sparkseid> Nice
[4:26:06] <+megaman_sentinel> Nice
[4:26:06] <cheapdoc> and woolie came
[4:26:11] <+fetrigon> sick KomodoHype
[4:26:12] <%Irridium> I wouldn't be surprised if it's a returning one. And they alternate new/return/new/ect
[4:26:20] <andre11dr> NICEEEEE
[4:26:22] <user_naim> see that was cool
[4:26:31] <andre11dr> Finally got that air grab
[4:26:35] <$cherubs_anonymous> They already said the order of new/returning characters
[4:26:48] <+diobestwaifu> Might guy and kakashi over here
[4:26:50] <Rawbone_saw> GG!
[4:26:53] <%kotl7> 37-24
[4:26:55] <user_naim> Aaaaaaaand rip
[4:27:01] <+chrollo_riz> I think the final final roster is just going to be all the story mode chars + everyone we saw in the credits
[4:27:01] <%MutedMimic> woolieSPICE
[4:27:11] <Rawbone_saw> that was fucking awesome, nice job guys
[4:27:11] <andre11dr> Oh it's over
[4:27:26] <andre11dr> Anyone has the score?
[4:27:32] <+fetrigon> woolie more like... woolfree
[4:27:36] <zenith0111> Woolie needed that set tho fr fr
[4:27:54] <Demoli_PT> no park tonight?
[4:27:55] <+fetrigon> pfffft I fucking hate myself
[4:27:58] <+chief_chongo> people on stick, whats your button layout?
[4:28:06] <Malik1002> wait what
[4:28:08] <%kotl7> @andre11dr 37 reg vs 24 wool I think
[4:28:17] <user_naim> @fetrigon more like fetrigone make a bad joke
[4:28:18] <%Mrthefro> Omg Woolfree woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:28:20] <+chief_chongo> ive got face buttons on top but my pinky is gonna be weak from having HS on the furthest top button
[4:28:20] <user_naim> but I lauhged
[4:28:26] <Rawbone_saw> @fetrigon made me chuckle
[4:28:28] <Demoli_PT> @chief_chongo P K D [] S H Dash RC
[4:28:34] <andre11dr> That's not that bad
[4:28:46] <cheapdoc> Everything is good ... in theory
[4:29:10] <+TraitorousAlf> @chief_chongo P S H Dash K [] D
[4:29:21] <Iam_Dead> on stick I use rainbow. dust on bottom left most button, then top row is P K S HS. dash is to the right of dust.
[4:29:22] <andre11dr> It's better than what happened that one time to when i played i first to 50 in MVC2 LUL
[4:29:45] <+chief_chongo> i've got it P S K H Dash Dust Burst RC
[4:30:09] <+countgaculatv> P S H K Dash Dust RC
[4:30:11] <Demoli_PT> i dont like burst on a button, find it easier to just dust+ one button
[4:30:15] <+chief_chongo> i need the dash button near or i wont be able to use it but HS placement kinda fuckin with me but dunno where else i'd put it
[4:30:24] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> TitaniumDragoonNeo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Good sets this week, my doods. Keep on that grind.
[4:30:52] <andre11dr> Yeah especially again Millia
[4:30:53] <+countgaculatv> I keep dash and rc on the bottom row on both sides of dust so I can use dash rc easier
[4:30:59] <+HazeyPP> Damnit I missed my chance to fight Woolz
[4:31:13] <andre11dr> That's her game, get the wall start the vortex
[4:31:17] <%Irridium> "Just don't get in the corner" 4Head
[4:31:22] <cheapdoc> Yes, I too can react with the reflexes of a young man
[4:31:24] <Magicferret> Just counter what your opponent is doing 4Head
[4:31:28] <andre11dr> She's Ibuki
[4:31:35] <%Sypheck> Millia doesn't really care about the wall she just wants you on the floor
[4:31:38] <+chief_chongo> im getting used to doing RC with three buttons so dunno if I really need the RC button
[4:31:53] <%Mrthefro> !Uptime
[4:31:53] <@Moobot> @Mrthefro WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 12 seconds
[4:32:01] <kojanga> @HazeyPP he didnt fight anyone just reg
[4:32:05] <user_naim> Reactable is a lie by the players of that character
[4:32:36] <+countgaculatv> That's why I prefer to tell people to see holes in block strings to either jump air dash out or 2p,2k or 6p. Sometimes It's more about seeing one situation rather reacting to one move
[4:32:38] <andre11dr> Sometimes you gotta jump say fuck it and just mash throw
[4:32:49] <+countgaculatv> fuzzy jump the god
[4:33:18] <zenith0111> Ignore the fact jump loses to low

[4:38:58] <%townzzzzz> can't talk must chipp
[4:39:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's Chipp. He can do anything at any time and you just have to DEAL.
[4:39:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> @TheotherKristian Oceania Park 3
[4:39:06] <user_naim> LUL
[4:39:07] <%Irridium> oh man the rollback chipp's are wild
[4:39:08] <%kotl7> @TheotherKristian oceania 3
[4:39:13] <+Mrbaconator> at least i had a better performance than last week reggie just hitting me over and over in the corner LUL
[4:39:31] <user_naim> @mrbaconator gg for just the name too
[4:39:38] <+Mrbaconator> ye it's great
[4:39:47] <+Mrbaconator> i gave it to octo in the first beta then he changed so i took it back
[4:39:56] <andre11dr> I don't know, Ive seen a Chipp actually die in two Pot Busters LUL
[4:40:13] <zenith0111> OH NOOOO
[4:40:19] <%TheotherKristian> its not oceania no one here
[4:40:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:40:21] <zenith0111> hocYouDeD
[4:40:30] <+diegobandzz> Damn
[4:40:36] <zenith0111> @theotherkristian Are you on the right platform?
[4:40:37] <NotHereToStream> its australia
[4:40:49] <%TheotherKristian> is he on pc?
[4:40:50] <%kotl7> @TheotherKristian it's on PC
[4:40:51] <+diegobandzz> You got it woolz
[4:40:54] <%TheotherKristian> im on ps5
[4:41:00] <%TheotherKristian> darnnn
[4:41:05] <+contramann> No my Spanish Children heard those words Woolie
[4:41:15] <%Mrthefro> What a psycho LUL
[4:41:24] <Renegadorade> I was Fucking wondering what was going on in park 3 Now I know
[4:41:25] <NotHereToStream> oh its oceania, my bad
[4:41:28] <user_naim> And Chipp is not a drug user somehow
[4:41:33] <Demoli_PT> ggs
[4:41:47] <+diegobandzz> Aye dios mios
[4:41:54] <andre11dr> @user_naim Well he was
[4:42:01] <andre11dr> He just stopped
[4:42:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> What are the chances we don't get any balance until Strive 2?
[4:42:13] <user_naim> @andre11dr still got that crack speed though
[4:42:15] <andre11dr> Allegedly, he is a president after all
[4:42:19] <zenith0111> Tbf doing a balance patch when new characters are a few weeks away would do so much harm
[4:42:42] <zenith0111> Imagine they nerf Sol but all DLC countered him
[4:42:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Max was talking about how historically ArcSys has been very reserved with the number of patches they put out, largely because of arcade parity
[4:43:01] <+diegobandzz> Nice
[4:43:30] <%townzzzzz> balance patch comes after all characters come out Kappa
[4:43:41] <zenith0111> hocMS Yeah ArcSys knows what theyre doing hocMS
[4:43:41] <roz_en> I prefer Fewer patches TBH. I don't feel like relearning shit every other month
[4:44:15] <mikeyjay47> can't wait to see 5 sols in top 8 at evo
[4:44:21] <andre11dr> I don't know even if the nerf 5S, H still has mad range, he has a reversal, and he has a comand throw that dose 40%
[4:44:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> I prefer fewer patches but not when Sol is like "Oh I got you with any of my buttons? Say goodbye to 70%"
[4:44:24] <%Irridium> gg's
[4:44:48] <andre11dr> I just hope they don't make Sol totally trash
[4:44:59] <user_naim> nice work @irridium and @demoliboy2 btw
[4:45:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> They won't, he's still the protagonist
[4:45:11] <andre11dr> Like they take away the cool ass combos
[4:45:12] <roz_en> @Daniel_Is_I Okay, maybe "targeted" patches.
[4:45:22] <WakeUpThrow> Aw ye, Birthday Train
[4:45:25] <+diegobandzz> Who we got for tn boys dillashaw or shadhagen?
[4:45:34] <Meltgar> THERE GOES HIS HEALTH
[4:45:43] <Malik1002> thats my homie on stream
[4:45:46] <%Daniel_Is_I> Goldlewis looks kinda nuts though with how much mix he has
[4:45:56] <+diegobandzz> Geez woolz
[4:46:02] <zenith0111> Goldlewis has legit setplay
[4:46:02] <%townzzzzz> ooooooooooooooo
[4:46:04] <+thehotrefrigerator> Ahh the two biggest weebs in GG
[4:46:05] <lucyucy> YOOOOOO
[4:46:11] <zenith0111> DED
[4:46:16] <andre11dr> @daniel_is_i So is Ky and he looking kinda rough at the moment
[4:46:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ky doesn't have much mix though. Foudre isn't an overhead.
[4:46:29] <user_naim> I like the setup of Woolie on P2 side waiting for everybody to walk up and play their song
[4:46:32] <+diegobandzz> Sheesh
[4:46:40] <zenith0111> ky has pressure not mix
[4:46:46] <+diegobandzz> Anybody watching the ufc fights tn?
[4:46:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Goldlewis gets a 50/50 on on every special basically
[4:47:16] <andre11dr> @daniel_is_i Nah i was talking about you saying that they'll keep Sol good because his the MC
[4:47:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> Well Sol is also Daisuke's self-insert lol
[4:47:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:47:56] <andre11dr> That's true
[4:47:57] <+diobestwaifu> I was that Chipp that just got wavechecked, gg man, never doing the overhead again
[4:48:04] <mikeyjay47> I think this guy kicked me out of heaven
[4:48:25] <andre11dr> Nago mirrors are actually pretty hype
[4:48:51] <andre11dr> Also this is my go to song in Xrd
[4:49:05] <%kotl7> @diobestwaifu overhead>fast RC>j.Dust>2K>2D
[4:49:09] <+DeaconBluesClues> what park is this? Australia 3?

[4:50:03] <mikeyjay47> 270 ms
[4:50:03] <%kotl7> but yeah don't Banzai! if you're not sure, very risky
[4:50:03] <+chief_chongo> doodLewd
[4:50:23] <+diobestwaifu> i usually do the rc after its blocked, but then again im not celestial, good learning experience
[4:50:33] <+chief_chongo> i got 8 frames rollback in my own region against some guy yesterday
[4:50:36] <andre11dr> Yeah Nago mirrors are cool to watch because it's like who will pop first
[4:51:00] <Meltgar> OOof the lag
[4:51:01] <%Sypheck> wifi battles fftbgEmpowered
[4:51:10] <passserby> dude's router blood popped

[4:51:19] <%townzzzzz> ain't over, never over
[4:51:26] <Meltgar> Hey at least it ain't Tekken Online Kappa
[4:51:33] <%jolene_orenji> this is supposed to be one of the not laggy stages
[4:51:37] <%Sparkseid> Specs matter
[4:51:38] <%kotl7> Tekken is 6 tho
[4:51:41] <andre11dr> Damn this dude either playing from Australia or form a McDonalds
[4:51:46] <+chief_chongo> i feel like im never on this stage
[4:52:03] <%jolene_orenji> @andre11dr he's just an actual australian who wandered in
[4:52:06] <roz_en> You also never know when there's somethin weird fucking with what would be an otherwise fine connection
[4:52:11] <+chief_chongo> he could be playing on McDonalds wifi in Australia
[4:52:17] <%Sypheck> this dude was born in the lag
[4:52:17] <+chief_chongo> gotta get your maccas with your GG
[4:52:19] <Meltgar> EMU WIFI Kappa
[4:52:26] <%ekodrop> all of australia is mcdonalds wifi
[4:52:26] <%jolene_orenji> they call it Maccas down theere
[4:52:38] <+chief_chongo> they abbreviate literally anything possible
[4:52:48] <%kotl7> LUL that tagline about the wife
[4:52:48] <+donaghy> it's true
[4:53:06] <user_naim> McDo in France right
[4:53:14] <%kotl7> MacDo even
[4:53:29] <user_naim> That c.S was so early

[4:54:03] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus I'm not seeing anyone in oceana 3
[4:54:10] <andre11dr> This Gio wasn't one of those
[4:54:15] <user_naim> f.S after drill was ballsy
[4:54:19] <Meltgar> WHACKED
[4:54:20] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:54:26] <%Sparkseid> rip danieo
[4:54:30] <mikeyjay47> just don't block i guess
[4:54:40] <roz_en> @DeaconBluesClues This is on PC, you on it?

[4:54:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[4:54:47] <zenith0111> GGs
[4:54:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Alright Woolie has improved a lot and I have not.
[4:54:52] <+chief_chongo> peace reggie
[4:54:57] <+DeaconBluesClues> ah, no, I'm on ps4
[4:55:04] <%townzzzzz> take it easy
[4:55:07] <Demoli_PT> cya reggie
[4:55:11] <zenith0111> Woolie plays fighting games?! hocWtf
[4:55:13] <+donaghy> Cya Reggie!
[4:55:13] <%kotl7> bye Reggie
[4:55:15] <+chief_chongo> ram leethul
[4:55:15] <+diegobandzz> Ggz reggie
[4:55:16] <user_naim> Nice having you Reg
[4:55:18] <NotHereToStream> j.S monkaS
[4:55:27] <plooplooke> Take care Regg
[4:55:39] <andre11dr> You know chat, this game haa blocking
[4:55:43] <zenith0111> I love seeing Ram losing Kreygasm
[4:55:46] <+DeaconBluesClues> this lack of crossplay is a huge drag as I keep trying to play people and everyone else i know is on PC
[4:55:48] <andre11dr> You just hold back
[4:55:54] <+chief_chongo> @andre11dr most of the time i forget
[4:55:59] <user_naim> @andre11dr it also has Dash f.S
[4:56:02] <%jolene_orenji> @andre11dr who needs blocking when you have disjointed hitboxes and fullscreen meterless projectiles
[4:56:02] <user_naim> so i dunno
[4:56:07] <user_naim> I’m tempted
[4:56:11] <NotHereToStream> i heard arcsys is implementing crossplay so hopefully its soon
[4:56:11] <Meltgar> NOT pressing buttons is the hard part of blocking Kappa
[4:56:12] <+chief_chongo> it is weird that PC is more populated usually it would be opposite
[4:56:18] <roz_en> I don't trust people who pick default colours
[4:56:26] <zenith0111> Shes just blocking with her health bar
[4:56:28] <%kotl7> @andre11dr why block when I can Alpha Braydo!
[4:56:30] <andre11dr> I'm just saying, i know it hard to remember
[4:56:31] <Meltgar> @NotHereToStream Hopefully SONY ain't a whinny baby
[4:56:40] <+chief_chongo> sony IS a whiny baby about this
[4:56:42] <andre11dr> As a Sol player i too forget
[4:56:44] <NotHereToStream> @Meltgar when is sony not a whiny baby?
[4:56:53] <+chief_chongo> they are getting a cut of sales from arcsys in exchange for crossplay IIRC
[4:57:03] <%jolene_orenji> @chief_chongo usually it's the hardcore people on playstation and the plebs on pc but since PS5 has like 5 frames of delay both are playing on PC instead
[4:57:20] <+chief_chongo> @chief_chongo oof why ps5 delay like that
[4:57:25] <andre11dr> Damn nobody said goodbye to Reggie
[4:57:31] <andre11dr> LUL
[4:57:38] <zenith0111> @chief_chongo Because it cant turn off vsync
[4:57:39] <+chief_chongo> i have it on PC and ps4 because.. i like to move around my house
[4:57:51] <zenith0111> Base Ps4 runs the best iirc..
[4:57:51] <%townzzzzz> put that millia MU to work
[4:57:52] <%jolene_orenji> @chief_chongo what's funny is it's even worse on PS5 than it is on PS4 somehow
[4:58:05] <mikeyjay47> why is no one blocking on wake up
[4:58:09] <Meltgar> @jolene_orenji HUH?! zyzxOhNo Wow that sucks
[4:58:09] <+chief_chongo> yeah ps4 seems pretty smooth but lobbbies are less populated than PC from my observations
[4:58:13] <%jolene_orenji> @zenith0111 it's PC, then PS4, then PS4 version on PS5, then PS5
[4:58:17] <zenith0111> PC and ps5 has way more problems then bas eps4 and its weird
[4:58:18] <%townzzzzz> cus grabs
[4:58:52] <+shieldanvil> only cowards wake up block
[4:58:54] <roz_en> PC lobbies straight up have too many players for it too handle on a given floor the past few days
[4:59:07] <+chief_chongo> yeah always with the broken battle stations
[4:59:11] <andre11dr> Those matches against Reggie helped for this moment
[4:59:23] <+chief_chongo> or can't connect to a guy waiting for a challenge. and then he disappears lol
[4:59:23] <andre11dr> Oh boy
[4:59:25] <%Sparkseid> i love playing against Pots with Nago
[4:59:28] <%fizzguy47> @chief_chongo i have literally not seen anyone in SE Asia region from launch till now on PS4
[4:59:31] <Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus you can also press 5k to contest kara pot buster since its 9f start up
[4:59:42] <andre11dr> I hope Woolie gets the business
[4:59:45] <+chief_chongo> @fizzguy47 doodSad
[4:59:51] <%jolene_orenji> @Sparkseid funny, I hate playing against nagos as pot
[4:59:52] <zenith0111> Woolie is the business
[5:00:02] <+GGLinear> Finally, another respectable character
[5:00:03] <+chief_chongo> i feel like i have the most experience fighting nago as pot... still useless
[5:00:05] <zenith0111> Literally
[5:00:09] <Demoli_PT> I'm the chipp player i literally bet my life on it
[5:00:11] <shernuff> damn he really just bites potemkins titty huh?
[5:00:11] <raveous> definitely true @WoolieVersus
[5:00:12] <+lbhosdelgado> Top 3 nagos: Fame, Hotashi, Woolie
[5:00:21] <+OroOreo> Ask octo
[5:00:25] <roz_en> @Demoliboy2 you have life?
[5:00:36] <%fizzguy47> @chief_chongo so i just go to JP
[5:00:36] <andre11dr> Doesn't GO1 play Nago?
[5:00:45] <NotHereToStream> no, he plays chipp
[5:00:48] <raveous> he did in beta
[5:00:49] <+Kuubyy> wowza
[5:00:52] <+chief_chongo> @fizzguy47 what country are you in?
[5:00:53] <andre11dr> Oh of course
[5:00:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GG
[5:00:54] <+sonofthedeepsouth> NO RE
[5:01:03] <Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus Pot buster is 6f start up, but kara is 9f
[5:01:05] <%fizzguy47> @chief_chongo Singapore
[5:01:18] <zenith0111> Kara is 2 frames slower*
[5:01:37] <+chief_chongo> ah damn I don't know what the gaming scene is in Singapore but I'd think people are down with some fighters
[5:01:38] <+StrikeTheErf> then you got a stew going
[5:01:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The celestial tower expired?
[5:01:44] <Demoli_PT> maybe
[5:01:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> UNGAS
[5:01:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:01:50] <+chief_chongo> You might just have to play missionary and spread the word of the one true Badguy
[5:01:56] <Demoli_PT> the bigger fear is mega fist at that point
[5:01:58] <zenith0111> Timing on Kara is pretty specific
[5:02:15] <%jolene_orenji> @sonofthedeepsouth IIRC it expires at the start of every month unless you win/play a bunch of matches in celestial
[5:02:16] <andre11dr> It does
[5:02:22] <raveous> yuuuup
[5:02:27] <%fizzguy47> @chief_chongo Yeah, I'll become a streamer lol
[5:02:41] <+chief_chongo> not much to lose, lots to gain lol
[5:02:48] <andre11dr> It grabbed my sword so it should grab a foot

[5:03:46] <%townzzzzz> @WoolieVersus gg, I won't give up
[5:03:47] <NotHereToStream> nago has better footsie tools over sol
[5:03:55] <+chief_chongo> i get to fight so few i-nos
[5:04:01] <zenith0111> Ino Kreygasm
[5:04:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> cmon I-NO players
[5:04:08] <roz_en> The phrase "just ___" is fast becoming a sign of someone who don't know what the fuck their talking about
[5:04:18] <andre11dr> Yeah that range is actually hard fir Sol to deal with
[5:04:25] <zenith0111> I play Axl so I get masochistic Ino playwrs throwing themselves at me
[5:04:25] <+lbhosdelgado> @roz_en just 6P 5head
[5:04:39] <+StrikeTheErf> yeah, anyone who says "just 6p" something is almost always a clown
[5:04:39] <%jolene_orenji> @roz_en I feel like I've only ever heard "Just X lol" sarcastically in situations where it's not actually that easy
[5:04:56] <zenith0111> Never 6p
[5:04:58] <+chief_chongo> just block the dolphin doodLUL
[5:05:00] <andre11dr> He can still hit heavy and S and hit you but if you play it right
[5:05:00] <+lbhosdelgado> jolene is correct, it is indeed a meme
[5:05:22] <andre11dr> You just keep him out
[5:05:28] <%fizzguy47> just don't get hit lmao
[5:05:28] <+CourageTheCat> F
[5:05:34] <%RyTYoung> Guys...has anyone read My hero Aca? I think I've spoiled myself big time NotLikeThis
[5:05:51] <+chief_chongo> i keep tryna watch the show but he cries so much i cant get like 4 eps in
[5:05:53] <+heyitsdenzel_> dope
[5:05:54] <roz_en> @roz_en I've had people be like "just grab Leos crossup", like its "just 6p dolphin"
[5:06:02] <+not_crabby> are these viewer games?
[5:06:04] <andre11dr> I'm not even caught up with the anime
[5:06:06] <+GGLinear> That was clean as fuck
[5:06:11] <zenith0111> The cureent chapters are making it kinda samey to everything else atm @rytyoung
[5:06:12] <%fizzguy47> @rytyoung just catch up in manga
[5:06:22] <+lbhosdelgado> not "just" as in it's always easy, but you should look to throw run through
[5:06:23] <+not_crabby> oh they are
[5:06:30] <+chief_chongo> s t r o k e tha BIG TREE
[5:06:41] <%jolene_orenji> I. Fucking. HATE. Fighting I-no. She makes me block shorthops and stroke the big tree and shouts "React, white girl, react!"
[5:06:59] <+chief_chongo> im horrible at getting out of the corner
[5:07:08] <andre11dr> Interesting, i thought I-No would be a rough fight for Nago
[5:07:11] <+chief_chongo> if i dont get counter than i-no always pushes me to the wall
[5:07:15] <%RyTYoung> @zenith0111 I just got curious about a certain character missing in midoriya's parenthood, and think I've just seen something that spoiled something massive...
[5:07:19] <andre11dr> All the air movement
[5:07:33] <andre11dr> I guess there is 2H
[5:07:56] <Diego_Umejuarez> u the best nag yet
[5:07:57] <+StrikeTheErf> bazingas rock parade
[5:07:59] <%Sparkseid> chop
[5:08:12] <+chief_chongo> @RyTYoung i tend to get spoilers for tons of things with that mindset lol. just pop on down to a wiki for a quick confirm and then OH WHATS THIS? major spoilers at the top of the page??
[5:08:27] <+CourageTheCat> I feel really dumb but is 6p forward punch?
[5:08:33] <+chief_chongo> @CourageTheCat yes
[5:08:35] <+CourageTheCat> i know the numpad part but not hte letters
[5:08:38] <+CourageTheCat> thanks
[5:08:49] <%jolene_orenji> after watching so much octo pimp watching a version of strive that's not modded into oblivion feels oddly quiet
[5:08:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:08:59] <Diego_Umejuarez> @WoolieVersus in the corner u can juggle with charged dust
[5:08:59] <andre11dr> Yeah take those wall supers
[5:09:04] <roz_en> @CourageTheCat Letters are game specific.
[5:09:12] <%RyTYoung> @chief_chongo it was literally a screen shot that ruined it for me, my dumb brain has made a connection, and then Google suggested the thought I had after seeing that screenshot NotLikeThis
[5:09:14] <andre11dr> Get the heavy knockdown
[5:09:18] <+Waage83> Ram became my main in game after I-NO was disapointing
[5:09:27] <+CourageTheCat> @CourageTheCat ah, that explains it
[5:09:30] <roz_en> @CourageTheCat In this case, its GG notation Punch Kick Slash Heavy Slash
[5:09:37] <+CourageTheCat> @CourageTheCat nice, thank you!!!
[5:09:40] <%jolene_orenji> @CourageTheCat for guilty gear the letters are P (punch), K (Kick), S (Slash), HS (Heavy Slash), and Dust (D)
[5:09:50] <%SirGO0SE> Ram became my main because I'm a degenerate :)
[5:09:55] <+shieldanvil> ram became my main after jam didn't make it in, and i figured one letter off was close nough
[5:10:04] <+chief_chongo> @RyTYoung yup thats how it be... spoilers dont usually ruin a story for me, they can halt my excitement to continue for a bit, but then i just wanna see HOW we get to that
[5:10:13] <%jolene_orenji> @shieldanvil Jamlethal Valentine
[5:10:13] <+CourageTheCat> ram became my main cuz elphelt ain't in :(
[5:10:16] <roz_en> @SirGO0SE You just like the puppy you sick ****
[5:10:16] <%SirGO0SE> i love that combo
[5:10:21] <+StrikeTheErf> mmm, that ram could have killed pretty easy
[5:10:32] <+GGLinear> Is Nagoriyuki easy to learn, or is Wooliie making him look easy?
[5:10:42] <andre11dr> @jolene_orenji I usually just say H for Heavy Slash
[5:10:43] <+chief_chongo> woolie making him look pretty easy lol
[5:10:49] <+chief_chongo> no random blood guage bursts
[5:10:50] <+StrikeTheErf> I think nago takes a certain mindset to work
[5:10:54] <Meltgar> Yeah, but also you gotta learn your blood guage
[5:10:58] <%invalid_robin> GG
[5:11:04] <roz_en> Nago is an acquired taste
[5:11:05] <%SirGO0SE> nice job @invalid_robin
[5:11:07] <+GGLinear> Seems like a badass character.
[5:11:08] <user_naim> gg
[5:11:11] <%RyTYoung> @chief_chongo yeah, it happened with the promised neverland for me, I got impatient so I read the manga after watching the anime, and thank GOD I did because they ruined the second season so bad
[5:11:17] <%jolene_orenji> @andre11dr that works but I think the "official" abbreviation is HS (or at least that's whats on dustloop LUL )
[5:11:25] <%SirGO0SE> i think all of ram matchups boil down to "can you stop her from putting you in the corner"
[5:11:28] <%SirGO0SE> yeah?
[5:11:38] <+StrikeTheErf> basically, corner is her win condition
[5:11:38] <+Waage83> Yeah that is true for a ram match
[5:11:38] <%SirGO0SE> because thats all i try to do as her lol
[5:11:46] <roz_en> @andre11dr Its tends to be HS in the game itself, at least it was that way in XRD
[5:11:46] <Diego_Umejuarez> having a line of fans is a very weird way to learn a fighting game
[5:11:47] <+GGLinear> The two characters I've been eyeing are Zato and Nago. But I've been told those two might give me a rough time if I start with them
[5:11:48] <%jolene_orenji> CUM ZATO cirMiku
[5:11:49] <+CourageTheCat> CUM ZATO CUM ZATO
[5:11:49] <+chief_chongo> @RyTYoung thats what i hear. i keep getting recommended s1 but then everyone says fuck s2. i haven't read manga in ages and dont really know where short of buying them which im not down for lol
[5:11:53] <zenith0111> The love to make the anime with as mant changes they can get away with as possible
[5:11:54] <+StrikeTheErf> she can't really kill you midscreen
[5:11:56] <user_naim> Zato should be interesting
[5:11:58] <+GGLinear> wasn't sure if that was accurate
[5:12:06] <andre11dr> Well it's about learning what she does in the corner
[5:12:06] <+chief_chongo> cum zato is best zato
[5:12:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> This Zato color really distracts me when I fight against it
[5:12:20] <user_naim> Milkman Zato
[5:12:24] <+chief_chongo> i also like toxic ooze flavored Zato
[5:12:26] <+CourageTheCat> haha semen funy
[5:12:26] <andre11dr> She has multiple options
[5:12:26] <iroh20> yogurt boi
[5:12:35] <+shieldanvil> @GGLinear if you're going to get bodied anyway, might as well get bodied on a character you think is dope
[5:12:41] <+CourageTheCat> mood
[5:12:41] <%jolene_orenji> @CourageTheCat yes :)
[5:12:44] <+CourageTheCat> :)
[5:12:44] <zenith0111> I think its a cool color but EVERYONE uses it
[5:12:51] <%SirGO0SE> yesterday i learned that Takehito Koyasu voices Zato
[5:12:53] <iroh20> this a fake Zato
[5:12:57] <+chief_chongo> they all just wanna get on Pot's stage with white zato
[5:12:58] <AgnusLaplace> @StrikeTheErf corner is kind of everyone's win condition
[5:13:07] <%jolene_orenji> SPOOGE FLAVORED LUL
[5:13:17] <AgnusLaplace> except for maybe axl who just wants you the fuck away
[5:13:21] <+StrikeTheErf> @AgnusLaplace yeah, but ram is a corner monster (I play her, this isn't salt)
[5:13:22] <+chief_chongo> green zato looks cool
[5:13:22] <zenith0111> LUL
[5:13:28] <+chief_chongo> ppeople sleepin on his other colors
[5:13:29] <+CourageTheCat> OUGH
[5:13:32] <%SirGO0SE> UGH
[5:13:32] <%jolene_orenji> EWWWW
[5:13:32] <+CourageTheCat> H U R T
[5:13:34] <zenith0111> DansGame
[5:13:35] <%Mrthefro> Never seen it but only fought a handful
[5:13:37] <roz_en> It could've been arakune
[5:13:38] <+Kuubyy> WOOLIIEEEE
[5:13:39] <+GGLinear> @shieldanvil lol fair. They just both look cool as hell. Axl, too. But I'm unsure how difficult the three of them would be to learn
[5:13:39] <%SirGO0SE> Cum sock yellow
[5:13:44] <+CourageTheCat> Encrusted
[5:13:48] <andre11dr> @gglinear I would suggest Zato ,Nago is pretty hard to play
[5:13:48] <+StrikeTheErf> @AgnusLaplace good rams are starting to avoid breaking the corner as long as possible to keep up her pressure there
[5:14:02] <roz_en> Put a little red in there for added worry factor
[5:14:05] <%townzzzzz> fisting
[5:14:06] <%jolene_orenji> why is there a rainbowdash figure floating around inside eddie??
[5:14:11] <+yusefHD> OhMyDog OhMyDog VoteNay
[5:14:13] <+GGLinear> Stop
[5:14:13] <user_naim> Thank you for that idea Woolz
[5:14:19] <user_naim> You fuck
[5:14:19] <zenith0111> @jolene_orenji CURSED
[5:14:32] <+yusefHD> Shoutout pats dog
[5:14:40] <%RyTYoung> @chief_chongo I would recommend reading the manga through the shonen jump app, that's how I finished reading the series
[5:14:53] <+chief_chongo> i always fuck up that RC into the buster but when i get it i am ELATED
[5:14:54] <AgnusLaplace> @StrikeTheErf i've noticed, I have to turn my leo unga down a bit to not get absolutely fucked by then
[5:14:59] <andre11dr> They should've given him like a really horrible yellowish green
[5:14:59] <%SirGO0SE> @StrikeTheErf so delay the wall break until it kills? isnt that against the strategy of getting the wallbreak for the increased meter boost to keep up "infinite" pressure?
[5:15:02] <stonestring93> megafisto
[5:15:03] <+GGLinear> From the LOOKS of it, Nago seems to require more patience than most of the other characters
[5:15:10] <+GGLinear> but I could be wrong
[5:15:10] <andre11dr> Just full on piss Zato
[5:15:15] <%RyTYoung> @chief_chongo it's not the best manga from what people have heard, but it's a way better ending than what the anime did LUL
[5:15:17] <+chief_chongo> @RyTYoung i'll have to check it out thx
[5:15:19] <zenith0111> To whom ever that Potemkin can reflect that clone
[5:15:22] <+Waage83> @StrikeTheErf Yeah i tend to throw out one to force them to defend and then go in on them
[5:15:25] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus I'll try to karabuster you to see if it works
[5:15:34] <+chief_chongo> can you flick the nago clone?
[5:15:41] <%townzzzzz> ye ye ye moar pots and pans
[5:15:41] <%jolene_orenji> I'm not this person LUL
[5:15:53] <user_naim> @jolene_orenji sabotage
[5:15:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:15:59] <zenith0111> @chief_chongo Yes
[5:15:59] <+StrikeTheErf> @SirGO0SE generally you can delay the wallbreak by one sequence, you'll still end up breaking it (usually with a super) and get the meter, but her corner pressure is way too strong to give up
[5:16:12] <andre11dr> @gglinear Nago is pretty tricky, you literally die if you do to many special moves
[5:16:12] <+chief_chongo> @zenith0111 doodTerror
[5:16:14] <%fizzguy47> love the Warhammer reference
[5:16:16] <%jolene_orenji> @user_naim I DIDN'T MEAN IT I PLAY POT TOO
[5:16:26] <zenith0111> Potemkin players like never use flick
[5:16:31] <+chief_chongo> i've only flicked gunflame and kys projhectile
[5:16:35] <+chief_chongo> maybe a ram sword?
[5:16:40] <+StrikeTheErf> @Waage83 if you mean throwing a sword, unless you have no choice I really recommend not throwing it unless they're in the corner or are about to be. midscreen sword throw is a waste
[5:16:41] <+chief_chongo> i couldnt tell
[5:16:42] <user_naim> @jolene_orenji collaborating with your Pot bretheren
[5:16:44] <zenith0111> Megafist is much better for gunflame
[5:16:45] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr Is that what the red gauge is? I saw him rip off his mask earlier and lose half his health, as well.
[5:16:49] <AgnusLaplace> is it me or does hammerfall reach like double what it did in previous games?
[5:16:50] <%SirGO0SE> @StrikeTheErf i see. so the goal is to end the round in 2 sequences
[5:16:50] <zenith0111> and kys fireballs are just trash
[5:16:56] <NotHereToStream> imagine flicking goldlewis skyfish
[5:16:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's so difficult to find people who play Nago like Woolie. Most people I play against turtle out and I can bait out slashes.
[5:17:08] <+StrikeTheErf> @SirGO0SE or at least 75-80% of the round
[5:17:20] <roz_en> Does anyone else beside I-no have a controllable projectile?
[5:17:20] <zenith0111> @notheretostream Thats possible. He could even flick hit scans in Xrd
[5:17:25] <+Waage83> @StrikeTheErf I disagree i find the one sword is a solid to get them to the wall make them defend then get close
[5:17:33] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus nah I'm IMegaFistOn1stD8
[5:17:39] <+chief_chongo> megafistoooo
[5:17:44] <andre11dr> @gglinear Yeah that's what that is ,see the multiple brackets that's the levels of blood he can have, at level 3 he dies
[5:17:55] <+StrikeTheErf> @Waage83 if they block the sword throw midscreen you gave up a whole button to get +3 once
[5:17:56] <NotHereToStream> @zenith0111 really? damn, because skyfish at different security level might be a problem for the flick
[5:17:57] <user_naim> @jolene_orenji Oh that name is you? God that made me laugh
[5:17:59] <%SirGO0SE> lvl 1021 monkaS
[5:18:07] <LorcaNomad> monkaS
[5:18:13] <zenith0111> @notheretostream The reflected fireball beats all fireballs
[5:18:16] <%jolene_orenji> @user_naim I was so happy when I opened guilty gear for the first time and was like "oh my god I have the perfect name"
[5:18:18] <+CourageTheCat> why does this song sound like the beginning of ram ranch
[5:18:20] <andre11dr> @gglinear But the more blood he has the better he gets
[5:18:21] <zenith0111> Thats its gimmick
[5:18:24] <%SirGO0SE> oh my GOD
[5:18:27] <%jolene_orenji> @CourageTheCat IT TOTALLY DOES
[5:18:28] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr Oh shit. Any way to reduce it? I saw a command grab and red shit coming out of the enemy when he lands a sword swipe.
[5:18:30] <NotHereToStream> @zenith0111 oh shit i didn't know
[5:18:36] <%SirGO0SE> you need practice? shit you gonna get it today it seems LUL
[5:18:44] <%kotl7> damn he does 5 hits running up, props!
[5:18:46] <+CourageTheCat> lmAOOO
[5:19:02] <zenith0111> @notheretostream Made more sense when there were more projectile characters so atm Flick in general doesnt even relaly need to be used
[5:19:11] <%SirGO0SE> that air combo into wallbreak is nutso
[5:19:16] <+Waage83> @StrikeTheErf Yes but it makes them hunker down in the corner waiting for the second sword then you go in put some pressure on them.
[5:19:33] <NotHereToStream> @zenith0111 good to know, thanks for the knowledge
[5:19:35] <andre11dr> @gglinear Hits reduced it and the bite reduces it A LOT you get to go nuts for a 10 seconds if you land the bite
[5:19:42] <raveous> SHMACKED
[5:19:42] <+StrikeTheErf> @Waage83 that's why I said midscreen, throwing sword in the corner is always good
[5:19:48] <bv728> I keep forgetting I'm running a mod and my hindbrain expects the taco bell every time counter pops up :P
[5:19:53] <%Daniel_Is_I> Bite also prevents it from increasing for a few seconds iirc
[5:19:59] <zenith0111> @notheretostream Np
[5:20:02] <+StrikeTheErf> but throwing S sword outside a combo is a massive gamble
[5:20:03] <+yusefHD> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[5:20:15] <%SirGO0SE> omg
[5:20:16] <+Waage83> @StrikeTheErf right i missed that
[5:20:18] <andre11dr> And doing a super also reduces it
[5:20:18] <%townzzzzz> the come back
[5:20:20] <%townzzzzz> noooooo
[5:20:22] <karismaticprik> oo not like this
[5:20:25] <%SirGO0SE> NEVA GIV UP
[5:20:26] <+Kuubyy> ALMOST
[5:20:28] <Demoli_PT> alright gg
[5:20:28] <+yusefHD> VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay OpieOP VoteYea
[5:20:32] <Orfington> that was a show.
[5:20:32] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr That's very, very interesting. So he seems like a character that's very reliant on your own restraint. Like an actual fuckin samurai
[5:20:33] <Dopamien> how can he slap?!
[5:20:36] <+GGLinear> that's sweet
[5:20:39] <user_naim> scary
[5:20:46] <colzack_> HP doesn't matter for chipp unless it's at zero
[5:20:59] <%SirGO0SE> i saw an i-no that put the fear of god in me the other day
[5:21:04] <+R0kushi> banger
[5:21:11] <%SirGO0SE> i had no clue her air game was so good
[5:21:20] <+superchronicc> ive refreshed twitch a few times but the sounds still seems off for me, sounds compressed
[5:21:35] <zenith0111> I thought that was just me
[5:21:46] <+Waage83> I fell like I-No would be great if her dash was faster or better
[5:22:00] <andre11dr> @gglinear Yep pretty much, Guilty Gear usually has some character that has a sub system like this
[5:22:00] <%Animatic_> Animatic_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[5:22:17] <andre11dr> Like Robo Ky or Sin
[5:22:21] <+StrikeTheErf> @WoolieVersus recommend swinging a sword to intentionally get hit early when she does raw note, it neuters her forced mix
[5:22:37] <zenith0111> Bruh
[5:22:38] <%SirGO0SE> you're getting some big W's today wool
[5:22:49] <zenith0111> Thats too big brain for me NotLikeThis
[5:22:51] <%SirGO0SE> looks like youve made up for the time lost when your back got booboos
[5:23:05] <+StrikeTheErf> anything not too disjointed
[5:23:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[5:23:07] <zenith0111> Just take the hit 4Head
[5:23:13] <+superchronicc> poke the note woolie
[5:23:41] <andre11dr> Does BB have Robo Ky/Nago tipe of caracter where they can just kill themselves if they play wrong?
[5:23:49] <%jolene_orenji> the utility HPB PogChamp
[5:23:50] <andre11dr> I actually don't know
[5:24:30] <roz_en> @andre11dr Dont think so, closest I would guess is Susano, who has to unlock his movelist as he plays
[5:24:30] <+StrikeTheErf> @WoolieVersus far S should work because it has a hurtbox unlike 5h, think it'd work to get hit by note. maybe 5k if close enough
[5:24:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> "Avoid conversation with the Chipp player. TheChipp player will lie. The Chipp player will make excuses. He will use techs he don't really know. If he gets really desperate, he may start to jump or tech."
[5:24:34] <shadowboss89> gg
[5:24:35] <coracor> poor potemkin
[5:24:46] <+yusefHD> Man..... Duel 1... KappaHD
[5:24:56] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr Sounds awesome. Def gonna pick this game up, then. I love unique mechanics
[5:25:00] <+StrikeTheErf> yeah just smack her
[5:25:05] <+chief_chongo> i just want to grab chipp as pot but i CANT TELL WHERE I AM FROM THE TRIPLE JUMPS
[5:25:11] <%jolene_orenji> ky is HONEST
[5:25:13] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[5:25:15] <+GGLinear> and gimmicks. I do love me some gimmicks
[5:25:24] <Utible> "good ol honest ky" Kappa
[5:25:25] <zenith0111> @gglinear Its why people meme that every GG character is broken lol
[5:25:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> Respectable my ass
[5:25:30] <+superchronicc> @sonofthedeepsouth dont look at them, dont acknowledge their existnece, dont shake their hands
[5:25:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Real
[5:25:47] <andre11dr> @gglinear Yeah again i would recommend starting with Zato ,Nago is pretty tricky, but you always do you
[5:25:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> I legitimately have more trouble with Ky than Sol as Gio
[5:26:07] <+Waage83> nice
[5:26:18] <zenith0111> Thats because Ky is meant to fight the rushdown types
[5:26:21] <roz_en> Ky's outfit seems less fight for a 2d fighting game shiloutte wise. He doesn't have nearly the presence as older games
[5:26:23] <+DannySteele> god ky's theme is such a banger
[5:26:26] <user_naim> @daniel_is_i SAME
[5:26:28] <zenith0111> Sol vs Ky is not 50/50
[5:26:35] <+superchronicc> @Daniel_Is_I is it because ky has more range than sol?
[5:26:38] <user_naim> Ky is too honest
[5:26:40] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr Thanks! How is Axl Low on difficulty when compared to the both of them, do you think?
[5:26:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> a good honest ky to cleanse the pallete
[5:27:23] <+StrikeTheErf> ky and ram I've heard are both good matches to stay at high blood
[5:27:26] <zenith0111> Axl is technically meant to be a easier character
[5:27:27] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[5:27:42] <+Waage83> Yeah I would not call Axl easy outside hte lower tiers
[5:27:45] <zenith0111> That is if you can stand charge inputs
[5:27:47] <andre11dr> @gglinear His ok ,you just gotta learn to stay back and learn how to keep people at distance
[5:28:13] <andre11dr> But you gotta learn to do that without get Negative Penaltie
[5:28:14] <+GGLinear> Ah, a Zoner, then? Interesting.
[5:28:14] <%jolene_orenji> fun fact: in the Pot mirror you can punish blocked Hammerfall with pot buster
[5:28:15] <zenith0111> Most axl combos are just 3 moves
[5:28:18] <%Daniel_Is_I> @superchronicc It's more that a lot of Ky's frame data and hitboxes just happen to be really good against Gio. His 6P stuffs most of her attacks, Stun Dipper is really good against her, etc.
[5:28:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dire Eclat puts her at the perfect range to follow up on
[5:28:34] <andre11dr> @gglinear Yeah he is THE ZONER
[5:28:40] <SleepyScreen> when your password is out of the box
[5:28:44] <SleepyScreen> :O
[5:28:58] <+GGLinear> All I know is that Axl's aesthetics really jive with me. Zato and Nago look like fuckin badasses. Whole game looks like a good time.
[5:28:59] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[5:29:02] <+superchronicc> @Daniel_Is_I is gio a light character or medium?
[5:29:10] <zenith0111> @gglinear In GG they really make sure to not have too many redundant designs. So Axls like the only zoner lol
[5:29:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> Light. All the girls in this game are light.
[5:29:12] <SleepyScreen> sajamVibe
[5:29:15] <roz_en> Ky feels like the most "strive" character in this game outside of Nago
[5:29:32] <+GGLinear> @zenith0111 That's refreshing to hear, actually.
[5:29:41] <+StrikeTheErf> @WoolieVersus Hammer Fall is -9 so you can start with 5k or cS depending on distance, maybe get more damage. Sorry to dump a ton of info comments on you
[5:29:43] <+HazeyPP> Bro gg!
[5:29:45] <+GGLinear> I hate when every fucking fighting game has a billion zoners
[5:30:02] <andre11dr> Looking at you BB
[5:30:04] <+StrikeTheErf> yep
[5:30:09] <zenith0111> @gglinear Like even the difference between Chipp and Millia who are similar archetypes is HUGE
[5:30:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:30:19] <+superchronicc> @GGLinear you ever play injustice?
[5:30:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> Time to see if it beats kara buster
[5:30:23] <+DannySteele> lot of pots today
[5:30:34] <+GGLinear> Hope this game keeps it's momentum, then. Because I think there should be more fighting games where every character is vastly different.
[5:30:37] <+HazeyPP> I'm doing well and I hope you're doing well today too
[5:30:49] <Demoli_PT> you got another round to test it on
[5:30:50] <%Mrthefro> Nerves got thest of em LUL
[5:30:59] <zenith0111> @gglinear Thats why I like a smaller rpster compared to those 50+ ones
[5:31:03] <raveous> Nago 214HS becomes airborn midway
[5:31:06] <zenith0111> roster*
[5:31:13] <roz_en> JESUS THIS OST FUCKS
[5:31:17] <+GGLinear> @superchronicc Yes, but not in a long while. Because I enjoyed how shitty and stupid Joker's kit was.
[5:31:21] <%Daniel_Is_I> God, Garuda Impact is so oppressive
[5:31:22] <andre11dr> @gglinear If you don't like zoners you better pray they don't bring Zappa back into this game LUL
[5:31:28] <+GGLinear> I like characters that just throw random shit around
[5:31:30] <+superchronicc> @GGLinear as far as I can tell, gg has always had a robust cast of different archetypes
[5:31:38] <+Waage83> Zato's theme is so good
[5:31:39] <felix_sooos> a tip for someone who just started playing fighting games?
[5:31:45] <zenith0111> Block
[5:31:52] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr I don't hate zoners, but I do hate watching zoner vs zoner matches
[5:31:55] <+HazeyPP> I was feeling pretty confident with the match against Woolie ngl
[5:31:58] <zenith0111> Like deadass you better block
[5:32:09] <+superchronicc> @GGLinear i played a little and caught some evo footage of deadshot players dominating just by zoning
[5:32:15] <roz_en> @felix_sooos Don't worry about learning everything right away. Block, and find simple things that work first
[5:32:31] <+GGLinear> Once watched a Pro Smash match with two Snakes (heavy zoner) literally lasted 20 minutes. It was pure fucking torment.
[5:32:37] <%townzzzzz> oh no
[5:32:49] <+superchronicc> do we have a wifi warrior?
[5:32:52] <zenith0111> ROLLBACKIA BibleThump
[5:32:52] <roz_en> So is that connection thing a issue with the game and not just a me issue?
[5:32:58] <%kotl7> @felix_sooos block low and learn by doing stuff vs a moving opponent
[5:33:00] <user_naim> Heavenly Router Buster
[5:33:03] <andre11dr> @gglinear Ok well Zappa is a zoner that has 50/50s from full screen that go into 40% combos
[5:33:12] <+GGLinear> @andre11dr Jeez
[5:33:16] <roz_en> Cause I'm ethernet'd up, and I STILL get that shit
[5:33:16] <+superchronicc> the pot's name LUL
[5:33:25] <andre11dr> These games used to be fucked up LUL
[5:33:28] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus GGs
[5:33:32] <+GGLinear> Evidently lmao
[5:33:46] <user_naim> nice job @jolene_orenji

[5:33:47] <+StrikeTheErf> @roz_en if you're on PC or ps4, that means one or both players might be dropping frames
[5:33:55] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus I fucked up the kara rounds 1 and 3 but 2 I got it and your move beat it
[5:34:09] <+cowkid222> After pots gun punch can you get a grab on block? Looks like a lot of stun.
[5:34:19] <user_naim> Come on, show me something Gio player
[5:34:20] <%jolene_orenji> @user_naim thanks! I popped off irl jolene5LUL
[5:34:21] <%fizzguy47> muh girl Gio come on
[5:34:31] <+StrikeTheErf> @cowkid222 can't get grabbed until blockstun ends, so it's a mixup
[5:34:32] <roz_en> @StrikeTheErf That would explain why its not every match then
[5:34:33] <+superchronicc> gio just exploded
[5:34:36] <LorcaNomad> PogChamp that perfect
[5:34:36] <andre11dr> Man when do they make the captain dude playable?
[5:34:43] <andre11dr> I forgot his name
[5:34:45] <+cowkid222> Ah thanks
[5:34:47] <+superchronicc> @andre11dr tuesday
[5:34:49] <%jolene_orenji> @cowkid222 nah, pot's actually plus on it. only thing you can do is block on meaty and keep blocking if he hits you with it
[5:34:58] <roz_en> Im rockin a 1660 super, so I shouldn't have issues on my end
[5:35:07] <andre11dr> @superchronicc No i mean Pots boss
[5:35:11] <zenith0111> I thought c.S is like +3? @jolene_orenji
[5:35:15] <andre11dr> He dose punches
[5:35:20] <+superchronicc> @andre11dr oh, idk
[5:35:31] <%jolene_orenji> @cowkid222 oh wait I misunderstood the question ignore me
[5:35:33] <zenith0111> oh wait I misread nevermind
[5:35:36] <user_naim> nice
[5:35:40] <%townzzzzz> grabrail is the leader of the zepp nation
[5:35:46] <+superchronicc> @andre11dr he seems like the most slept on opportunity
[5:35:55] <+cowkid222> No worries dude
[5:35:57] <%jolene_orenji> @zenith0111 pot's c.S is +4 on block apparently
[5:36:14] <+StrikeTheErf> her 2d is basically a projectile
[5:36:20] <user_naim> GGs Gio player
[5:36:21] <LorcaNomad> yeah gio's 2D hitbox is fucking nuts
[5:36:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> I tried using the 2D at the end but drifted into range
[5:36:26] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus don't know if you saw it but that move you did totally beats kara buster
[5:36:29] <+OctaivianRex> Oh we Neo Shadow Woolie today huh?
[5:36:36] <andre11dr> @superchronicc Yeah, his really OP in the Story too
[5:36:59] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus I fucked up the first round but the second round I did it right and it beat it anyway LUL
[5:37:10] <+superchronicc> @andre11dr he would totally be sort of a boxer
[5:37:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:37:16] <LorcaNomad> what's this sol recolor?
[5:37:18] <zenith0111> I thought Nago was hella stron in Open Beta then they got him buffed lol
[5:37:21] <andre11dr> But honestly i just hoped Chaos has dope gameplay
[5:37:39] <+superchronicc> @LorcaNomad i think its one of the dlc colors you buy
[5:37:47] <%jolene_orenji> for his 5p, Chaos wields A G U N
[5:37:51] <zenith0111> He really didnt need that buff just people have yet to really realize Nago really gets it done in one combo
[5:38:01] <andre11dr> This is a moded color
[5:38:16] <andre11dr> Isn't it ,it has Woolies logo on it
[5:38:22] <%jolene_orenji> woolie's is
[5:38:29] <Brandon__Brando> ya it's moded
[5:38:33] <user_naim> Watch Chaos be a projectile grappler or some shit
[5:38:44] <%jolene_orenji> I don't think woolie has any other mods besides the nago one installed
[5:38:48] <+Waage83> you mean like axl?
[5:38:50] <zenith0111> Another Axl? Nah @user_naim
[5:38:57] <%fizzguy47> the sol color is in a pack
[5:38:59] <+superchronicc> the only mod woolie ever needs
[5:39:12] <LorcaNomad> watch chaos summon his car for his super like captain falcon
[5:39:16] <user_naim> I guess Axl does fill that niche
[5:39:19] <user_naim> I forgot
[5:39:28] <+superchronicc> he would benefit from a pie stealing button mod though
[5:39:31] <DrkJP520> Hey, Woolie. Did you hear about the new cgi dragon ball movie, Dragon Ball Super Super Hero?
[5:39:42] <%townzzzzz> hell yeah
[5:39:59] <andre11dr> @drkjp520 That sounds terrible
[5:39:59] <roz_en> @DrkJP520 It is not called "Dragon ball super SUPER hero" is it?
[5:40:04] <zenith0111> Yeah GG characters have very unique niches which is why its hard for them to just add new charcaters
[5:40:10] <DrkJP520> Real title. Not kidding
[5:40:20] <roz_en> Oh goddamit
[5:40:21] <%fizzguy47> did anyone else see a 6S in that match?
[5:40:26] <Demoli_PT> oh jesus these rollback frames
[5:40:34] <Demoli_PT> oh its better now
[5:40:47] <andre11dr> @darkdrill You said cgi ,where is it on the Tekken scale?
[5:40:50] <optosi> pc performance test when
[5:41:05] <%townzzzzz> bench mark
[5:41:05] <+LevelUpSlick> is this heaven?
[5:41:06] <+superchronicc> oh no its white zato
[5:41:13] <+ozarkhunter> Gonna have a goldlewis stream?
[5:41:20] <%fizzguy47> @levelupslick park
[5:41:20] <zenith0111> White Zato is default color at this point.
[5:41:28] <+LevelUpSlick> @fizzguy47 gotcha
[5:41:30] <roz_en> @andre11dr It's not "bad", I saw a clip, but I didn't know the title. Still seems like a downgrade though
[5:41:39] <+superchronicc> @zenith0111 my eyes strain at that color
[5:41:45] <user_naim> We could have Reggie play Goldlewis against Woolie’s Nago
[5:41:57] <zenith0111> @superchronicc Borderless white lmao
[5:42:00] <andre11dr> @not_crabby So is that like Tekken 5 or 6?
[5:42:01] <+GGLinear> Gold Dick looks like an odd character
[5:42:12] <zenith0111> Idk how that got passed a designerd eye
[5:42:12] <Brandon__Brando> wow
[5:42:45] <roz_en> It's better than MOST japanese CG, but thats not saying much. Theres adequate model deformation
[5:42:47] <Renegadorade> Yeah shit
[5:42:49] <%fizzguy47> how do you do half circles 486 without jumping is what i want to know
[5:42:51] <plooplooke> That scream always gets me jesus
[5:42:52] <andre11dr> This song, it's probably the one song that I'm not sure about
[5:43:03] <+ozarkhunter> Still wierds me out in JP Zato is Dio but in ENG he's Jotaro
[5:43:05] <%townzzzzz> everyone keeps mistaking goldlewis and the burger sheriff from xrd
[5:43:17] <Brandon__Brando> @fizzguy47 do it in the middle of a move or fast enough before the jump can register
[5:43:20] <zenith0111> But I thought its legit the same dude
[5:43:23] <+superchronicc> @andre11dr it was the zato theme for me until i listened to the whole thing where i turned around on it
[5:43:26] <+thatjuantoo> @plooplooke could buffer whilst dashing/normal etc.
[5:43:27] <zenith0111> Even has a eyepatch
[5:44:03] <roz_en> @andre11dr It works lyrically
[5:44:14] <roz_en> *when you know the lyrics
[5:44:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:44:24] <andre11dr> Yeah but those vocals are a little much
[5:44:50] <Brandon__Brando> !MOTIVATED
[5:44:50] <@Moobot> @Brandon__Brando 2274 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:45:00] <roz_en> I dig it personally, but its definitely different
[5:45:15] <zenith0111> When he stops that Rekka its not his turn anymore
[5:45:21] <%invalid_robin> !MOTIVATED
[5:45:21] <@Moobot> @invalid_robin 2275 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:45:24] <roz_en> COOKED
[5:45:25] <+superchronicc> this song slaps
[5:45:42] <andre11dr> Still in The Dark always a banger
[5:46:01] <andre11dr> Probably my favorite XX song
[5:46:09] <Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus GGs, iuf you ever need chipp training hit me up
[5:46:21] <+superchronicc> I also love vortex infinitum but idk if its in this game or not
[5:46:59] <TrevorMayCry> @superchronicc thats the korean ost right? idk if its in
[5:47:05] <+ozarkhunter> Good ino color
[5:47:09] <andre11dr> Actually no ,Keeo the Flag High is my favorite XX song
[5:47:16] <+superchronicc> @TrevorMayCry i thought it was robo ky's theme from xx
[5:47:36] <TrevorMayCry> no robo kys theme was "Holy Orders?" which is just a fucked up version of kys theme
[5:47:52] <TrevorMayCry> i remember cuz i had the unfortunate time of getting it randomly when playing +r
[5:47:58] <roz_en> GG
[5:48:01] <+superchronicc> okay that saddens me that its only in the korean mix version
[5:48:07] <NotHereToStream> good sesh
[5:48:12] <Demoli_PT> good games woolie
[5:48:20] <TrevorMayCry> for real. the korean ost is a banger
[5:48:23] <Exillion_44> thought my pc was exploding when i first heard holy orders?
[5:48:23] <plooplooke> Take care man, I love watching your matches
[5:48:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Thanks for the games Woolie, even if I got bodied in both of them lol
[5:48:29] <%ChrisBardow> ONE MOAR GAEM

[5:49:02] <Demoli_PT> probably 3 sesssions yeah
[5:49:05] <Demoli_PT> for DE
[5:49:23] <+superchronicc> @andre11dr the korean mix is the banger i was talking about
