[0:06:57] <SilverWolfX9> Why didn't NeoGeo cabinets exist in the US? I would have thought the cheapness of the cabinet would have popularized it here.

[0:23:03] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @skewerstar Not sure if we're gonna do them live on streams first. Would probably need more stuff set up beforehand and I'm still kinda flying by the seat of my pants with this idea.

[0:24:47] <%jiggy_snipe> Leona Kreygasm
[0:24:48] <%gatorafan> Nelson and Bandeiras are from Brazil and Zarina is from Colombia so no.

[0:25:23] <LaikaCDP> FINALE
[0:25:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah it's just Brazil and Colombia. Both Nel and Bandeiras are from Brazil, and Zarina's from Colombia
[0:25:31] <+Schiz_Turtles> Heidern?
[0:25:32] <%Solidnick18> that's fine
[0:25:34] <@Menitta> I thought you hated Nelson
[0:25:36] <jerkhov_> max and woolie are both rock men of culture
[0:25:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WoolieVersus remember when VIOLENT DONG DONG did Rock's win pose and it was the raddest shit
[0:25:41] <+bustawof> I mean it is he aint wrong
[0:25:41] <DRAGUN_Xrd> I'm gonna go figure out the lobby system so I don't ready up again on accident
[0:25:48] <kimonochrono> best stage
[0:25:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm yelling at reggie to pick him
[0:25:51] <Mvrdok_> Btw chat, there's a manga where Iori is transported to another world at the end of KoF 97 called King of Fantasy
[0:25:54] <MichaelDood> SourPls
[0:25:57] <Mordexai0> Reggie really just made a team KKK
[0:26:05] <thatbandltguy> i feel that woolie
[0:26:06] <@Menitta> KOFXV should look pretty good after Samsho
[0:26:07] <%Pigg1yJuffs> God, the models in this game are still rough.
[0:26:11] <FeltSn0wman> mash LP
[0:26:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mvrdok_ Iori continues to be OP as shit even in another world, the comic
[0:26:14] <BlackermanZX> i mean XIII was beautiful and also almost killed SNK
[0:26:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> kof 13 is the best pixel fighter period
[0:26:19] <+Polter_ge1st> ROCK MUTHAFUKIN HOWARD
[0:26:25] <indigochunk> Max gets a tingly feeling in his left nip every time Rock is mentioned.
[0:26:26] <sals5> This game is so goood tho
[0:26:32] <@Menitta> I just wish KOFXIII had a better roster.
[0:26:36] <jerkhov_> it was one of snk's first games after getting back from playmore
[0:26:36] <+bustawof> KURAINAH
[0:26:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Pigg1yJuffs yeah lol, a lot of the base roster looks eh at most, but there's good ones. the real problem with XIV's graphics is their shader stuff
[0:26:43] <skewerstar> Yeah, just mash Square for autocombo into super if you have meter.
[0:26:44] <%Prevot> that UI is kinda eeehhh
[0:26:50] <Mvrdok_> @Guntanks_in_Space Even as a laud player LUL
[0:26:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> everything looks slathered in vaseline and i loath it
[0:26:52] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This game's graphics are fiiine
[0:26:53] <zamzoph> King Kreygasm
[0:27:02] <FeltSn0wman> double HCF jermaDisgust
[0:27:02] <+captain_history> The models are fine though. Not impressive but fine after the change in shaders.
[0:27:06] <jerkhov_> SF5 is an ugly game too so it's equal
[0:27:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mvrdok_ iori figured that "yo this is like my bass right? all right then!"
[0:27:13] <sals5> I wish max would play 14 again
[0:27:20] <Tucker0603> King is my favorite, WOMEN IN SUITS MAN!!!
[0:27:23] <indigochunk> Yes KOF, my favorite Latin button basher
[0:27:28] <+jetjagger222> honestly this kinda looks better than sfv
[0:27:35] <Mvrdok_> @Guntanks_in_Space "I can play Wonderwall on this"
[0:27:38] <+Dualvipers> Both of my favoritve KOF characters on screen rn
[0:27:39] <BlackermanZX> trap shot is pretty good
[0:27:41] <%gatorafan> Max never finished the Terry legacy daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:27:45] <%generalve> KING IS DA BEST
[0:27:47] <+captain_history> this is far more fun than SFV yeah
[0:27:48] <zamzoph> clothes didn't blow off FeelsBadMan
[0:27:49] <%croxeye> casual raging storm
[0:27:50] <%jiggy_snipe> I'm kinda tired of the SFV and SF4 look
[0:27:52] <%Solidnick18> alright kim
[0:28:04] <jerkhov_> terry legacy probably should've just been fatal fury and a few kof anyway
[0:28:07] <ChinMusicTwo> those kim pants bro cmon so stiff
[0:28:10] <falconx9k> He hates evil
[0:28:15] <%Prevot> this and sf5 look bad in different ways
[0:28:20] <+jetjagger222> sfv colors and proportions looked off
[0:28:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> @jetjagger222 there's a distinction on this now that you mentioned comparing SFV lol. SFV has okay texture/shaders but pretty ugly models and style, while KOFXIV has good models but awful texture/shaders
[0:28:21] <cyclpsrock> 4 diff types of jumps
[0:28:29] <FeltSn0wman> 1 frame proximity throws ukogW
[0:28:32] <jerkhov_> this game does have some good animations at least
[0:28:33] <+bustawof> spread your wings young rock
[0:28:44] <@Menitta> This game plays so freaking well so I can forgive the subpar visuals
[0:28:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> but they also kinda have the same extremes in terms of shader stuff where SFV looks like clay at times, while yeah XIV looks like vaseline at times
[0:28:47] <skewerstar> People always talk about Terry's engrish but sleep on King's VENOM STRAIKE and TORNAD KICK!
[0:28:50] <%Solidnick18> ok
[0:28:51] <indigochunk> Guys guys, come on, not all fighting games can look like guilty gear levels of presentation
[0:28:53] <sals5> 14 roster is way better than 13s tho
[0:28:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> but yeah XIV plays GOOOOOD
[0:29:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> like really good
[0:29:01] <@Menitta> Though expectations are higher for KOFXV
[0:29:09] <thatbandltguy> @Prevot from that ripped angel model in sfv lighting we can tell the problems for each are exact opposites
[0:29:20] <@Menitta> I would so much rather play KOFXIV than XIII because of the roster.
[0:29:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> also the real good part about XIV looks-wise is the ANIMATION
[0:29:25] <+bustawof> I hope they bring back shermie for 15
[0:29:30] <jerkhov_> not everyone can be as stylish a jump from sprites to 3D as guilty gear
[0:29:33] <+captain_history> I really love how they recreated Oswald's animations here.
[0:29:33] <DRAGUN_Xrd> that's the button layout I use
[0:29:36] <%croxeye> terry doesn't suck :(
[0:29:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> see Rock there and how he animates super good
[0:29:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah Oswald's jump to 3D went well too
[0:29:50] <Mordexai0> @croxeye His REAL dad
[0:29:51] <%croxeye> i mean he's not top tier anymore
[0:29:58] <+jetjagger222> animations are super snappy
[0:30:00] <%croxeye> Terry raised him tho
[0:30:02] <didgereedoodah> I'll believe the gameplay is great but the visuals are so bad
[0:30:06] <%croxeye> even if geese was his blood
[0:30:13] <plushysceptile> Someone a while back pointed out that in the entirety of the SNK franchise, KoF XIV is the only time Geese and Rock canonically meet
[0:30:17] <@Menitta> I am disappointed they never took advantage of being 3D and added a bunch of costumes
[0:30:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> maybe next game...
[0:30:27] <FeltSn0wman> you also get EX specials in max mode
[0:30:30] <+jetjagger222> the visual fidelity varies per character
[0:30:31] <Mordexai0> @croxeye Yea. But Geese is alive here. So he knows how shit his real dad is
[0:30:34] <%Pigg1yJuffs> I will say, the shaders do play hell on this game. Rock's hair looks bad a d only because the shaders do little to nothing for it.
[0:30:38] <%jinking79> auto combos r in the game but who cares
[0:30:41] <%Solidnick18> ior Kreygasm
[0:30:53] <@Menitta> The auto combos in this really suck
[0:30:55] <jerkhov_> randumb
[0:30:59] <@Menitta> Like even for auto combos
[0:31:05] <sals5> Autos suck in this game
[0:31:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19

[0:31:19] <+Dualvipers> K baby!
[0:31:19] <sals5> Like they should
[0:31:21] <kimonochrono> the autocombos in this game are literally only if you dont know how to do anything, the damage on them is terrible and bad use of meter
[0:31:24] <MattDemers> K9999 when Kappa
[0:31:37] <%Irridium> and sometimes the auto combos just... don't come out. it's weird
[0:31:37] <Mordexai0> @mattdemers I unironically wish
[0:31:48] <BlackermanZX> K King and Ryo is my fav team
[0:31:49] <+jetjagger222> isnt this stage from real bout

[0:32:37] <+captain_history> K' is not as popular as Kyo but he is very popular anyway.
[0:32:43] <fist_wizard_jay> Really hope they bring him in the new KoF game
[0:32:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> K' is hella popular
[0:32:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> everyone loves the Not Bruce Lee in leather look lol
[0:32:56] <fist_wizard_jay> Duck King’s fuckin cool

[0:33:14] <%Solidnick18> let's go ralph
[0:33:22] <Mvrdok_> While developing KoF 99 they planned to not include Kyo and Iori but feared the backlash and had had trouble deciding which version to put in so they added 3 Kyos LUL
[0:33:23] <didgereedoodah> rising taco
[0:33:24] <+Dualvipers> How in the world did KOF become the mexico fighting game? Growing up I played it in bootleg machines that had random arcade games but was that what got it big down there?
[0:33:26] <%SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time more
[0:33:27] <nevan_44> LMAO
[0:33:32] <thepizzascotsman> bro pat wants to fight you on tem tem rn
[0:33:33] <@Menitta> I hope KOFXV brings back more Metal Slug characters
[0:33:35] <%DomPressesButtons> @menitta this kyo is a revamped NESTS
[0:33:37] <%SomersaultJustice> is this for fun or glory?
[0:33:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mvrdok_ they added 3 kyos, and a "Kyo Clone" to boot (in K' lol)
[0:33:41] <fist_wizard_jay> RISING TACO
[0:33:41] <+Merhabi> Huh
[0:33:45] <kimonochrono> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN

[0:33:50] <%croxeye> def for Fun
[0:33:53] <+jetjagger222> @dualvipers neogeo machines were cheap and everywhere
[0:33:56] <@Menitta> Ye but the 2000 costume is so gooooood
[0:33:57] <Mvrdok_> @Dualvipers They where cheaper than Capcom's
[0:34:00] <thatbandltguy> ralph lost his grab
[0:34:02] <indigochunk> All the fun
[0:34:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> 99 Kyo is indeed the GOAT
[0:34:05] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Pigg1yJuffs subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:34:15] <Mvrdok_> @Guntanks_in_Space Yeah LUL
[0:34:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> also Ralf doesn't have the Argentine Backbreaker anymore
[0:34:16] <%SomersaultJustice> neogeo is pretty easy to emulate too
[0:34:18] <%gatorafan> Ralf no longer has a grab I think
[0:34:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> as well as the Ralf Tackle
[0:34:22] <FeltSn0wman> yeah it's not in 13 either
[0:34:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> ?
[0:34:23] <%DomPressesButtons> same moves and slightly different jacket but still essentially NESTS
[0:34:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> now all he has are EXPLOSIVE PUNCHES
[0:34:27] <Visored34> bring back Buriki One characters
[0:34:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> he didn't have it in 13 either woolie
[0:34:35] <+Dualvipers> Ahh right I woulndt know about the price shit since that era died before I was birthed lol
[0:34:37] <%croxeye> SNK is willing to change stuff for better or worse lol
[0:34:38] <+psychocalibur> he hasn't have it since 13
[0:34:38] <%SomersaultJustice> STREAM CANCELLED
[0:34:39] <+swushandsuch> owned
[0:34:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ralf hasn't had his command throw in XIII
[0:34:40] <thatbandltguy> they wanted to make him different to clark
[0:34:40] <MattDemers> C L A R K
[0:34:44] <thatbandltguy> cmon woolie
[0:34:45] <+RichardMF_> Clark is The Grappler now
[0:34:47] <BlackermanZX> 13 didnt have it i think
[0:34:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ralf Jet Upper is forever gone though, and i'm so sad about it
[0:34:52] <%Solidnick18> clark is throw man
[0:34:52] <thatbandltguy> kof13 didnt have it no
[0:34:53] <%oyyzzo> woolie nerfed
[0:34:55] <jerkhov_> it's like having a down down shoryuken oh wait
[0:34:55] <cassiecagedd> Have you played SF5 they did get rid of dragon punch
[0:34:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> XIII didn't have Ralf Backbreaker
[0:35:11] <@Menitta> Clark still has his command grab iirc
[0:35:11] <Mordexai0> @visored34 KoF 11 having Buriki One characters was really a phenomenon. 11 is such a gem to me
[0:35:32] <@Menitta> 11 is still my favorite
[0:35:38] <+captain_history> Clark got all that. Ralf was like this in XIII too.
[0:35:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> XI is my favorite right after 98
[0:35:40] <@Menitta> Tag KOF is just woolieGASM
[0:35:42] <kimonochrono> yuh
[0:35:45] <%jinking79> Clark broke KoF 13 with his grab so Ralf lost his
[0:35:46] <%SomersaultJustice> snk supers
[0:35:56] <+nekodelic> remember when this game looked like absolute trash? it looks so much better now
[0:35:56] <indigochunk> Ok guys calm down, the amount of energy from the face cam is gonna scare the children
[0:36:02] <indigochunk> The children being me
[0:36:04] <%Solidnick18> he wants galatica phantom

[0:36:14] <scrumbotime> Woolie almost has more people watching than Saltybet
[0:36:29] <Visored34> @Mordexai0 Kizuna Encounter and Agressors of Dark Kombat characters would be cool too
[0:36:31] <HeavyNorse> Ralf is so creamy.

[1:08:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> she's still strong but not prominent like in 1.0 lol
[1:08:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> also executionally she's easy tbh
[1:08:31] <skewerstar> This is the new Najd Stage!
[1:08:38] <TheFinalHazard> isnt nelson like low-mid? it's been a while since i've payed attention
[1:08:44] <Josef_Stryker> As far as boxer characters goes, what do u guys think of Nelson?
[1:08:50] <antthefool> Whaddup party people
[1:08:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> nelson's a good boxer character
[1:08:52] <Mordexai0> Did they even try out Najd? She's such a coo new character
[1:08:59] <Mordexai0> cool*
[1:09:03] <$SilverRoddo> “You’re not gonna send me to the Kula!”
[1:09:06] <thatbandltguy> not that exited for nelson
[1:09:06] <@Solidus_113> super cancel dream cancel
[1:09:07] <MrMegaphone> coo*
[1:09:14] <thatbandltguy> i thought bandieras was cooler
[1:09:16] <+jetjagger222> compared to... balrog, combo, dudley
[1:09:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's no Rob Python but he'll be fine
[1:09:20] <+jetjagger222> vanessa

[1:10:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> there it is, it's coming back
[1:10:20] <@Solidus_113> CLIMAX CANCEL
[1:10:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think just do it on first hit
[1:10:40] <JINcredible1> might need to be first hit cancel
[1:10:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> oooh that's TIGHT
[1:10:53] <+jetjagger222> wait is that a g gundam reference
[1:10:55] <skewerstar> Maybe do the regular super version?
[1:11:07] <Axle13j> now that's D A M A G E
[1:11:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah like in 98
[1:11:24] <BlackermanZX> Max Mode is THE true damage source
[1:11:25] <%K2YP70C0CK> atpShutup i will erase u!
[1:11:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> have a meter popped in Max mode, your supers become SDMs immediately
[1:11:37] <thatbandltguy> nope
[1:11:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yea going to max mode gets you the BIG DAMAGE
[1:11:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ora Ora Ora Ora no1ORA
[1:11:56] <+jetjagger222> kono kobushi shouri o tsukameru
[1:12:03] <Josef_Stryker> They should've given Nelson a Pile Bunker punch
[1:12:06] <fuji_92> Max mode gets you the big penis
[1:12:10] <FeltSn0wman> advanced is level 1 > level 2
[1:12:13] <+zanzibar_junker> you can do two ex moves during max mode
[1:12:15] <+jetjagger222> @Josef_Stryker that's maxima's schtick
[1:12:20] <Josef_Stryker> Fair enough
[1:12:23] <FeltSn0wman> climax is level 1 or level 2 > level 3
[1:12:36] <BlackermanZX> max mode combo cancels are super important
[1:13:33] <FeltSn0wman> double hcb jermaDisgust

[1:14:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> i wonder if i still remember basic kula stuff lol
[1:14:47] <thatbandltguy> they should be practicing movement instrad
[1:15:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> nope you can't climax cancel out of autocombo
[1:15:10] <sals5> autos suck dont use ut
[1:15:25] <+jetjagger222> dbfz this aint

[1:15:39] <thatbandltguy> very important
[1:15:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[1:16:10] <+jetjagger222> YEYEYE
[1:16:32] <FeltSn0wman> st.LP is the usual answer to hops
[1:16:34] <thatbandltguy> knowing how to hop and hyperhop consistently helps alot
[1:16:44] <BlackermanZX> also use evasion a lot
[1:16:53] <MrMegaphone> Woolie is so brave broadcasting alongside Japanese EVO
[1:17:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> look man, you gotta do what oyu gotta do!
[1:17:47] <MrMegaphone> It's working for me, I mean I'm watching this anyhow
[1:17:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> same lol
[1:18:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> also SCVI's finished for now too so yeah, i can chill here even more

[1:18:54] <MrMegaphone> Yeah I just missed it, got Blazblue on in silent on the other screen. I'm here for the commentary
[1:19:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah that is it
[1:19:14] <FeltSn0wman> its a tatsu followup
[1:19:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> the quintessential Kula combo goes like stand C, f+A, qcb+B then f+B into DP
[1:19:43] <BlackermanZX> Its like K
[1:19:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> err, f+D for the slide
[1:20:03] <BlackermanZX> K does a similar followup
[1:20:05] <%jinking79> Nelson got that CG
[1:20:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> big regg is LEARNING
[1:20:08] <+jetjagger222> yup mixup bullshit
[1:20:14] <%Haarute> does dp have a folloup?
[1:20:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> nah
[1:20:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> Kula's DP doesn't have a follow-up like K's heavy DP
[1:20:34] <$SilverRoddo> Teaching is rewarding.
[1:20:49] <+jetjagger222> not quite yoga flame
[1:20:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> heavy ice breath is a combo start lol

[1:25:41] <FeltSn0wman> woolieF woolieU smash invite
[1:25:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's so many rooms you can just move if you had 6 people
[1:25:49] <@Menitta> oh yeah the lobby system in KOFXIV is weird
[1:26:06] <BlissAuthority> I still can’t believe Joker stole Geno’s invitation
[1:26:26] <@Menitta> I can't believe Geese died trying to get into Smash
[1:26:37] <Visored34> man i would like to play but the game is still downloading the update

[1:27:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not a pause

[1:27:30] <+zanzibar_junker> Start
[1:27:37] <+jetjagger222> @ChrisBardow its a pretty busy design
[1:27:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> Rock is fine, Vanessa i can get used to, but Mary's is funny for me
[1:27:44] <Mvrdok_> It's the NEST arm prosthetics
[1:27:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> she's no Harumi Ikoma but her GET FUCKED is the best
[1:27:57] <+jetjagger222> the borg arm and piercing woulda be enough
[1:27:58] <LBC921> This song is the best!!
[1:28:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> and woolie could open the lobby for more people and they just rotate since there's like 6 different cabinets basically
[1:28:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:28:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> though it's weird they got King voiced by Ikoma but not Mary

[1:28:33] <+jetjagger222> king and charlotte's voices are identical
[1:28:44] <gustavozxd> I like the announcers for this game calebCB
[1:28:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> same VA, though not in Samsho 19 i think
[1:28:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> J Maxwell Powers is a good-ass KOF announcer
[1:28:56] <Visored34> not Maximum impact bad though
[1:29:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> i hope he comes back in XV lol
[1:29:08] <ThousandDogs> Woolie I like you well enough but FUCKING CRUSH HIM RID
[1:29:16] <gustavozxd> the maximum impact English voices are something else LUL
[1:29:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> tfw rock can;'t control his blood rage

[2:06:55] <Josef_Stryker> COUNTERED
[2:06:59] <jaygrimessucks> As is Leona.
[2:07:06] <Tucker0603> FUCKING RAR
[2:07:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> Yamazaki became an Orochi head in canon because of Fan demand
[2:07:12] <SheefEatsBeef> oh he's doing like flicker jabs
[2:07:23] <kingkeldeo31> He's too crazy for the Orochi to control him
[2:07:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yeah the Snake charmer fist is practically Fiicker
[2:07:26] <skewerstar> He's literally too crazy for the Orochi!
[2:07:34] <jeaguerjack> hes the hakkeshu of death
[2:07:36] <+spaghetti_shaman> This is child abuse
[2:07:37] <%K2YP70C0CK> Vice too right? mymemory fades
[2:07:42] <%Haarute> yamazaki is in wild mode all the time
[2:07:44] <Man_in_the_Red> Orochi aint touching Yamazaki with a 50 ft pole
[2:07:49] <%jinking79> 8 Orochi and Yamazaki's Orochi head is Death
[2:07:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> so you have Iori denying the blood riot, Leona channeling it to her advantage, and Yamazaki being too crazy to possess
[2:08:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah the rest of the heads are Mature and Vice, CYS, and Goenitz
[2:08:01] <+FrenchTact1cs> thats my secret... BITCH IM WILD
[2:08:10] <pillowwasp> I always like the character that doesn’t use the special power but keeps up with everyone
[2:08:14] <%K2YP70C0CK> atpRtsd atpRtsd

[2:10:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> kim is just good in every game
[2:10:09] <+zanzibar_junker> yes
[2:10:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> it is not explained but they're there

[2:10:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:10:31] <bazz_tv> his pants aren't as good as they where in 2d though
[2:10:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> @zanzibar_junker what game was kim bad in??
[2:10:31] <@Menitta> For the longest time it was just classic Kyo
[2:10:32] <Man_in_the_Red> @gustavozxd 14, because his pants have been burned by the sun like Icarus
[2:10:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> the early DLC was retro Kyo/Iori and Nightmare Geese
[2:10:38] <+zanzibar_junker> they are tied to Iori when he got his power back
[2:10:40] <+unnamedhero0013> Classic Iori. Mexico approves.
[2:10:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> and i think Retro Athena too
[2:10:46] <+cheezy_snackz> i would agree if his legs weren't tied together
[2:10:50] <@Menitta> Wtf how did I miss those
[2:10:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> or rather, 98 Athena
[2:10:54] <bazz_tv> RIP best pants animation in the genre
