[0:11:46] <ToastyBroDude> Man they should really nerf Mr. X. He's too good.
[0:11:52] <+starzo0> I have sub-baseline knowledge of tekken, if I were to pick a main based solely on looks, who would upset you the most
[0:11:53] <pillowwasp> Mr x isn’t a balanced character
[0:11:57] <cdrom321> @solidusrex The stream title is Tekken 7. What happened?
[0:11:57] <+a_moloch> Any one else noticed Pat looks weird this stream?
[0:12:02] <%fatal_penguin_> Mr X too OP
[0:12:04] <BootyZipperooni> can you escape regular grabs with 1+2, rather than 1 OR 2?
[0:12:16] <%Solidnick18> nerf guns
[0:12:19] <Second_Omega> @starzo0 Lucky Chloe
[0:12:19] <+WickCastle> the boost he gets from dmxs song is op

[0:12:21] <+ShinobiAJ> no 1+2 is not a valid throw escape for regular throws
[0:12:22] <ToastyBroDude> Mr. X's grabs are inescapable, it's SO BULLSHIT
[0:12:22] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:12:26] <NarcissistCactus> do korean backdashes you cowards
[0:12:37] <+ShinobiAJ> you can react to all grabs with correct breaks anyways so its kind of irrelevant past low level
[0:12:41] <+kewlmyc> LET'S GO REGGIE

[0:31:31] <nothuzad> beautiful
[0:31:32] <+WickCastle> not tekken

[0:31:43] <mozzarellariya> i love how geese spoke perfecly english untill he hit the reppuken LUL
[0:31:46] <T_Sasquatch> @WoolieVersus i meant that im not happy about negan because i just remembered he is dlc
[0:31:46] <PhazeShift> just watch JDCR vs LilMajin EVO2018 and thats why you should play tekken
[0:31:47] <WG101> @Menitta like a corpse?
[0:31:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Noctis would've been a better fit in SC6, but everyone's probably said that by meow.
[0:31:53] <%SWFanatic> yoshimitsue is so fun to play, you can be so goofy and infuriating
[0:31:55] <PhazeShift> one of the hypest matches i've ever seen

[0:32:36] <@Menitta> I'd prefer Noct in SC6 but he's still super fun in Tekken
[0:32:38] <+Tacos_Bob> pfff, real Tekken players uses mouse and keyboard
[0:32:46] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I mained yoshi in 3 and made my sisters quit video games by spamming his command grab
[0:32:50] <+TheObliviousAdobo> These Shennigans with Yoshi is why you don't see most players getting to a high level with him. Most Yoshi players don't learn proper fundamentals.
[0:33:04] <%UrsulaCat> hes cute
[0:33:06] <%UrsulaCat> cute noises
[0:33:10] <$ToastyBroDude> cheer1000 Barely play fighting games but damn, Tekken, MK, and so many others are so much fun to watch! Keep up the cool streams Woolz!

[0:55:12] <+countgaculatv> @zanzibar_junker I agree
[0:55:17] <peachy996> Oh yeah I mained Tag 2 Kunimitsu
[0:55:33] <peachy996> I miss her tho
[0:55:38] <+voynich_> safe in most instances is anything minus 9 on block or less
[0:55:39] <IsNotJesus> Safe moves are 0 to-9 on block
[0:55:56] <+Shastafield> poke
[0:55:56] <+voynich_> fastest moves are generally 10 frames
[0:55:57] <+countgaculatv> @APB_Harleqyn He has a general knowledge of frame data. Some attacks on block recover faster than pretty much all punishes
[0:56:11] <APB_Harleqyn> ty all!
[0:56:48] <mozzarellariya> reggie is the same guy that commentating for SFV right?
[0:57:02] <magicianmadmad> I jus realized they were in the corner XD
[0:57:11] <+zanzibar_junker> AK looks like a dark souls character
[0:57:25] <RyuuAoi> We in here!!
[0:57:26] <mozzarellariya> i might be wrong but i remember watch canada cup
[0:57:39] <%jinking79> Woolie have u created Rage/Black Heihachi in this game
[0:57:55] <jubejube56> but is there a reverse tombstone?
[0:57:57] <KillMyPast> Gotta pay attention to the hands
[0:57:57] <peachy996> Is AK's Giant Swing just as threatening as King?
[0:58:03] <redman5> kaz doesnt have a generic df1, hes mid poke is kinda df4. he also doesnt have a generic hopkick
[0:59:00] <Revant_tillywink> @ArtThouBored yep i think its the same move
[0:59:06] <peachy996> Looking into adding AK to my list
[0:59:07] <jubejube56> 71 damage!
[0:59:11] <+zanzibar_junker> I do like the fact that kazuya just fully wields his devil powers
[0:59:15] <KillMyPast> Giant swing at the wall is ridiculous
[0:59:20] <%PlumpPotatoRump> ^
[0:59:23] <mozzarellariya> i don't know that LUL
[0:59:42] <peachy996> The mash is important
[0:59:43] <iLikeChocoCake> all 2+4 throws side switches
[0:59:46] <+countgaculatv> Geez
[0:59:50] <IsNotJesus> @WoolieVersus Generic 2+4 throws all side switch
[0:59:51] <Revant_tillywink> @WoolieVersus turn off rage your getting inflated damage numbers
[0:59:56] <DeebzNutz100> 2 grab is usually side switch
[1:00:08] <Synchroscheme> damn, woolie playing tekken? sick.
[1:00:24] <$konekoryugamine> OH DANG
[1:00:36] <$konekoryugamine> Also, I saw some footage of Jump Force. WOW does it . . . look . . . interesting.

[1:02:57] <+Shastafield> LUL
[1:02:59] <NinjaGentleman> Maybe Research Reggie
[1:03:01] <ManOfReason> man tekken combos feel so weird compared to 2d fighters
[1:03:06] <+Totally_Not_Toby> let's get some groundswell for Reggie Research
[1:03:08] <%UrsulaCat> reggiesearch
[1:03:17] <+Totally_Not_Toby> we gotta push it for summerslam
[1:03:35] <+jimbofletcher> y r tekken dlc characters so expensive?
[1:03:38] <%UrsulaCat> I knew a guy named reggie once when I was a teenager. he was cool
[1:03:40] <%AliveInside191> @ManOfReason Some MK players might feel at home, since they both use pre set strings
[1:03:51] <+zanzibar_junker> They should make anew mishima character 4 SC6
[1:04:06] <peachy996> Yeah I kinda do with MK and Tekken
[1:04:29] <+voynich_> damn first try?

[1:08:28] <Rojahh> thoughts on the MK11 Leaks?
[1:08:32] <%PlumpPotatoRump> rikutoAsta rikutoAsta rikutoAsta
[1:08:40] <ManOfReason> @WoolieVersus Which do you think is more important for bringing in new players, sing-player content or easy to learn systems?
[1:08:46] <+Totally_Not_Toby> woolie did you see that jump force is now the single easiest game to mod
[1:08:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:08:49] <Laironx3> You should summon EyepatchWolf for Jump Force
[1:08:49] <cassidynaufahu> Show kaz combos
[1:08:54] <+jetjagger222> @woolieversus hey woolz, ever heard of change air blade? its a versus top-down shooter by arcsys
[1:09:03] <+l33t_j4gu4r> going to play soulcal7?
[1:09:08] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> @woolieversus how do you best take advantage of an attack or block stun that forces crouching?
[1:09:11] <Rojahh> @WoolieVersus Thoughts on MK11 roster leaks
[1:09:35] <cassidynaufahu> Where is this at
[1:09:40] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that might be podcast news but jump force's source files are included in the game so now it's the simplest, easiest, cleanest game to mod currently on the market
[1:09:42] <%DrPoxx> Is the speed of light too slow for Fighting Game pros?
[1:09:50] <fgiting> Jet upper is f,b2
[1:09:55] <%itsjustdoogan> @WoolieVersus much appreciated
[1:09:57] <fgiting> Not f,b1
[1:09:58] <Ben_Ben817> How do you guys calm down under stressful situations in fighting games? Whether it's a huge losing streak or pressure? @WoolieVersus
[1:10:01] <Revant_tillywink> do an electric than do 4 more
[1:10:05] <Revant_tillywink> do it you coward
[1:10:27] <+Totally_Not_Toby> sorry project files
[1:10:32] <cassidynaufahu> Hold d f at the same time
[1:10:35] <%Blazymaniac> @WoolieVersus im thinking of trying to learn either blazblue or guilty gear, is one easier to get into than the other?
[1:10:40] <cassidynaufahu> Then 1 r
[1:10:43] <+dj_berserk_ix> atpHarada atpMurray
[1:10:44] <cassidynaufahu> *4
[1:10:46] <+thedreampie> Of course Ginyu
[1:10:50] <+DarthPhallus30005> Fun teams
[1:10:53] <+generalve> Woolz sorry to bother you again but do you want me to resend the emote to you ?
[1:10:55] <TungstenViper> @woolieversus are you interested in DOA6 ?
[1:11:03] <+DarthPhallus30005> Hit is meta in season2
[1:11:04] <Krando> @blazymaniac i think blazblue is easier
[1:11:07] <+countgaculatv> @WoolieVersus I usually bounce between claw and regular on pad with Tekken. What's your preference? This is the only fighting game I play on pad btw.
[1:11:10] <+DarthPhallus30005> He beats new GC pretty clean
[1:11:13] <+Totally_Not_Toby> @WoolieVersus do you have any advice for someone who only plays smash who wants to get into fighting games?
[1:11:42] <+gael_j> Ideally both
[1:11:48] <gottigotbundles> money match pat in tetris
[1:11:51] <@Solidus_113> how easy is it to transfer skills between fighters with 3, 4, or 6 buttons?
[1:12:03] <cassidynaufahu> After df 1 4 do b 1 4 2
[1:12:09] <%Ir0nAgr0> Just got into fighting games last year thanks to SBF and my first fighting game BBtag, put over 350 hours since launch. Do you think you'll be playing it on here?
[1:12:23] <cassidynaufahu> *back 2
[1:12:25] <TheNewJapanGuy> I love how AK is just Great Muta ^!
[1:12:30] <+zanzibar_junker> More f2p models
[1:12:31] <deafmelone> All fighting games need arcade modes
[1:12:42] <MickeyMoore13> ^
[1:12:44] <cassidynaufahu> *back 2 4 1
[1:12:45] <Ben_Ben817> @WoolieVersus Any tips on getting into 2d fighters? I'm thinking about getting into DBFZ and I've been super comfortable play 3d fighters like Tekken and Soul Calibur
[1:12:46] <deafmelone> just to ease back into it
[1:12:59] <Revant_tillywink> reggie you have to clear some ground with the hellsweep
[1:13:06] <gottigotbundles> with rival fights like old. tekkens and endings
[1:13:21] <redman5> kaz beginner gameplan: mixup wd to hellsweep or wd to ws2 / f4
[1:13:24] <prime_name> @WoolieVersus Any chances of seeing a Geese tonight?
[1:13:24] <+zanzibar_junker> Arcade mode and handful characters 4 free
[1:13:28] <Revant_tillywink> you can take a whole step before doing the move
[1:13:35] <%Wonderbot3000> @woolieversus why are fighting games on pc so unpopulated
[1:14:23] <Sorubr0> T7 is the FG of the decade
[1:14:31] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> Thanks guys! Much appreciated
[1:14:41] <+countgaculatv> I can answer that, it's cuz it's cheaper for tournament set up and cheaper to own with a preset console
[1:14:51] <KiwiRedgrave> @WoolieVersus Kotal is configrmed by steam leaks
[1:14:56] <DeebzNutz100> War Gods
[1:15:00] <%Ir0nAgr0> How much time should Iput into labing new moves vs trying them in actual matches?
[1:15:05] <peachy996> Kotal was the best
[1:15:26] <MickeyMoore13> I'm just happy ma Black Dragon bois are back
[1:15:28] <Krando> T7 is the only FG i've fully enjoyed, tried SC6, SFV is meh and aesthetics is trash, DBFZ tag fighters feels frustrating to play against other folks
[1:15:36] <nothuzad> I hate the way MK games animate and the block button it just feels so jerky to me
[1:15:39] <Krando> dick jab isn't needed
[1:15:39] <peachy996> "Taste the blade of Osh-Tekk!"
[1:15:49] <Sorubr0> the thing is T7 feels so polished
[1:15:49] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:15:50] <nothuzad> but to each their own :)
[1:16:04] <nothuzad> well T7 was in arcades for ever V:
[1:16:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Smash is a fighting game
[1:16:12] <Deadpool2450> Kotal Ogre/ Ogre Khan. At least Kotal didn't transform into some weird Cronenberg God of War monster
[1:16:22] <+thedreampie> Smash isn't a video game
[1:16:24] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie! Where's the horse penis? Pat insists he hasn't got it
[1:16:25] <+Harawanagangsta> Do you have the Horse Penis from the Mailbag episode?
[1:16:28] <+Pleasant21> Who took the horse penis?
[1:16:36] <o0bscure> Where's the horse cock, Woolie?
[1:16:38] <DomunDomunDomun> @WoolieVersus Pat wants to know who took the horse dildo.
[1:16:41] <+SuperChumps> Where is the horse penis woolie?
[1:16:45] <sosuke5> Wheres the horse penis, Woolie?
[1:16:46] <+Harawanagangsta> Wheres the Horse Penis Woolie?? Where is it?
[1:16:50] <lamontino> Wheres the horse penis woolz
[1:16:52] <$cureneckbeard> Oh apparently Mat has it
[1:17:05] <CareBear420> Woolie Wheres the horse penis?
[1:17:06] <%jinking79> sounds like me in KI
[1:17:08] <flagi64> are we finding out about the horse penis?
[1:17:09] <Keeble24> Woolie HORSE PENIS
[1:17:11] <+Harawanagangsta> that sounds like something Pat would say
[1:17:26] <flagi64> someone asked in his stream and he said ask woolie
[1:17:27] <+dawsfloss> pat is infecting chat
[1:17:35] <+KorieTheCoward> im sorry woolie
[1:17:38] <DeadlyRaveNeo> yoooooooo
[1:17:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah but Pat would throw in an obscure word or term to prove his point
[1:17:54] <DSD24> @WoolieVersus Will you play Soul Calibur 6 on stream in the future?
[1:17:58] <Keeble24> Where's the horse penis?
[1:18:09] <+SuperChumps> where is the horse dildo woolie????
[1:18:19] <+dawsfloss> matt apparently took the penis
[1:18:28] <flagi64> @RAAAAAINMAKER you arent wrong
[1:18:40] <reokie_t7> DBFZ is fun but I prefer games with a more chill nutural game
[1:19:10] <%jinking79> wait where is this horse penis coming from
[1:19:12] <Synchroscheme> that's why KBD is so important
[1:19:25] <+KorieTheCoward> mailbag
[1:19:28] <+KorieTheCoward> way back
[1:19:30] <+Heroes_of_Vale> Someone in chat brought it up on Pat's stream a few minutes ago
[1:19:41] <flagi64> Miss that mailbag
[1:19:41] <Keeble24> blame the angry red ginger in his stream
[1:19:58] <flagi64> mailbag had some great moments
[1:20:08] <peachy996> And Noctis stage is small too
[1:20:10] <%Wool> What is the best way to have accessible information during tournaments? i.e. bracket, times, delays, etc.
[1:20:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Don't exact want to piss those guys off
[1:20:16] <+KorieTheCoward> had woolie fighting it
[1:20:26] <+generalve> LUL
[1:21:00] <IsNotJesus> damn, he's got a pretty good KBD
[1:21:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie, my bob is ready
[1:21:21] <hayley0wns> woolie sandbagged the dildo crowd so hard
[1:21:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> THIS ONE IS LESS CREEPY
[1:21:40] <DSD24> Can't way to play Lei Fang again in DOA6
[1:21:46] <luzoc> Is there still a block button in MK 11?
[1:21:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'd say guilty gear feels a bit less stuff
[1:21:48] <nothuzad> also Guilty gear has great learning tools
[1:21:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> *stiff
[1:21:51] <nothuzad> not teh best but good
[1:21:51] <peachy996> Or Yoshi heals and I force you to come to me Kappa
[1:22:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> BlazBlue is Mike Ross' SFV anti-venom
[1:22:11] <+generalve> @WoolieVersus Im Sorry to bother you again but if you lost the emote i sent ill be happy to send it again through msg or donation
[1:22:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> So it must be good
[1:22:36] <DeadlyRaveNeo> we must fight
[1:22:51] <ManOfReason> Theres a Boomers by my school that has a tekken 5 cabinet, but the joysticks on it are so janky lol
[1:22:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:22:52] <Asperger_Mode> why were shoulder buttons banned?
[1:22:59] <DeadlyRaveNeo> binded buttons suck
[1:23:00] <mozzarellariya> guilty gear/blazblue got the best music of all the fgc FIGHT ME!
[1:23:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, when you ready to get blown up on stream
[1:23:02] <deafmelone> Ive been playing thumb since 31st
[1:23:16] <DeadlyRaveNeo> i play smash on a stick
[1:23:26] <peachy996> Button Mapping is simpler
[1:23:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> leffen plays high level dragon ball so i don't think it's to different
[1:23:38] <+Totally_Not_Toby> lol thanks. most of my fighting game friends just tell me to stop jumping
[1:23:42] <+spiritloll> i think its easier to go from smash to 3D fighters tbh
[1:23:48] <%krispen_wa> I don't think anyone would fight you on the fact that Arksys games have the best music
[1:24:07] <spawnvagrant> Tbf its not like they have any competition nowadays
[1:24:09] <@Solidus_113> woolieREMEMBERS
[1:24:10] <nothuzad> msot fighting games are like boxing - smash is kinda like sumo
[1:24:13] <$LuisKingKing> I suck at fighting games but I love them so much and I buy every new one and still suck and of course i want to get better but I love playing so many different games but I don’t get better and I wonder do i need to just stick to one game or can I carry fundamentals into every game?
[1:24:23] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @DeadlyRaveNeo
[1:24:44] <ManOfReason> Yeah, that the hardest thing coming from smash. jump ins are so strong that it becomes a habit in traditional fighters
[1:24:50] <mozzarellariya> i feel like smash should be it own genre so people stop bitching about it not a fighting game
[1:25:06] <DeadlyRaveNeo> can smash be played on a fight stick
[1:25:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> There are fundamentals in fighting games that def transfer, blocking, spacing, pressure and punishing are universal
[1:25:13] <mozzarellariya> with many smash clone and all
[1:25:32] <+l33t_j4gu4r> what do u think are the main differences between 2d and 3d fighters?
[1:25:33] <+nutgoth> Thats no ttrue at all
[1:25:40] <reokie_t7> Platform Fighters are a thing
[1:25:41] <Zayasu> are they?
[1:25:41] <nothuzad> pc communities hav ebeen getting bigger - most games just didnt release on pc
[1:25:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> they want the hardware
[1:25:56] <SacredDeity> @CaptainPileDriver dbfz wasnt completely new to leffen, he played umvc3
[1:26:02] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus What game would you recommend for getting into 3D fighters as someone used to 2D? I'm good at Pokken but terrible with everything else
[1:26:14] <+spiritloll> PC is you trade less delay for longer queue times
[1:26:15] <nothuzad> most fgs didnt release on pc and its mostly not tourney standard - but the communitie shave been getting bigger
[1:26:22] <peachy996> I'd to love to fight with you guys but I have a wifi problem I cant fix
[1:26:40] <peachy996> Sorry
[1:26:42] <BlueKaixa> I'd love to but no PSNsub
[1:27:00] <@Menitta> Rip lines
[1:27:04] <spawnvagrant> PS Plus is kind of a scam otherwise I'd hop on the PS4
[1:27:13] <i_love_thicc_chicks> I don't have Tekken 7.
[1:27:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I love on the otherside of the World so I'll just criticize with my pet dingo
[1:27:25] <+jetjagger222> KUZE
[1:27:26] <Zayasu> @Menitta soulcalibur is much easier than tekken
[1:27:27] <+jordy_j_s> Haven't seen Noctis at all so would love to see him
[1:27:29] <+Answer_Moose> So I know nothing of tekken, what's that bears name
[1:27:30] <@Solidus_113> I wanna see some KUMA!
[1:27:32] <redman5> play marduk
[1:27:35] <IsNotJesus> my god I get a 3bar from england
[1:27:36] <+Answer_Moose> cause play that one. lol
[1:27:38] <Potatoidea> Akuma
[1:27:38] <%jinking79> damn it just found it
[1:27:51] <%PlumpPotatoRump> @isnotjesus saaaammme
[1:27:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> PANDA
[1:27:52] <@Menitta> SC6 seemed more intuitive
[1:27:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT WAS PANDA
[1:27:59] <Rygart121> PANDA
[1:28:03] <mozzarellariya> IT PANDA
[1:28:06] <+supahrob64> PANDA YOU FOOL
[1:28:14] <peachy996> SC6 has better movement
[1:28:15] <MickeyMoore13> MA BOI Fury
[1:28:18] <%ChoculaUltra> jet upper inc.
[1:28:19] <%PlumpPotatoRump> that was a really good laufh
[1:28:19] <reokie_t7> @spawnzombie this is why i dont have a ps4, like i already paid for internet NotLikeThis
[1:28:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I predict you'll eat 4 Snake Edges
[1:28:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> panda cause there are some differences between kuma and panda
[1:28:29] <stealthfart> I thought there was a conversation about not streaming at the same time. Woolie taking risks. Also, show me that Armor King tech.

[1:30:00] <gottigotbundles> he allows invites
[1:30:06] <+generalve> how do you avoid kings grabs ?
[1:30:06] <reokie_t7> SC6 has more to do for new fg players and has a much much easier movement system
[1:30:10] <frydchikin_> !MOTIVATED
[1:30:10] <@Moobot> 90 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:30:19] <mozzarellariya> suplex city bitch!

[1:30:38] <theneosloth> for king he does have some true 50/50 mixups with the grabs but you can usually predict what grab they're gonna use depending on where you are
[1:30:43] <+Answer_Moose> oof
[1:30:44] <razielhex> Man, Bryan Fury had a hell of an evolution to Cowboy Skeletor Luchador Construction Worker
[1:30:45] <i_love_thicc_chicks> @itsjustdoogan INDEED
[1:30:45] <theneosloth> and you can duck them obviously
[1:30:46] <reokie_t7> And the customization system in SC is way better than T7s

[1:35:36] <ManOfReason> @woolieversus does it seem hard to visually read check moves in tekken?
[1:35:37] <deafmelone> how do i find this session
[1:35:42] <+countgaculatv> @itsjustdoogan The facial and body animations are bad. Like ugly bad.
[1:35:54] <+WickCastle> howarewang
[1:35:56] <peachy996> I've never seen a slimier looking Frieza
[1:36:08] <Oneyeseesin3D> that hwarorng players thinking. " this asshole isn't a first dan!"
[1:36:12] <%UrsulaCat> R E G G I E L O R E
[1:36:18] <peachy996> Him in Jump Force vs Pokken Mewtwo in a battle for a towel
[1:36:19] <+countgaculatv> At least Xenoverse was laughably bad, Jump Force looks ugly when you look at it longer than a minute
[1:36:20] <@Solidus_113> just waiting for Joker to release
[1:36:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> can't wait for smash ultimate stream
[1:36:21] <%UrsulaCat> 20008?

[1:36:28] <+kaywiththetea> @itsjustdoogan Cause its just like all anime fighters, its gets hyped for a week to a month then its dead as fuck after release
[1:36:37] <%ChoculaUltra> can't wait to see what the modders do with Jump Force though.
[1:36:50] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> apatJpeg

[1:37:09] <pirateofpie> It'd be amazing if people mod Jump Force into being good
[1:37:11] <IsNotJesus> GGs @WoolieVersus
[1:37:13] <nohat1375> first time seeing woolie play tekken
[1:37:15] <%itsjustdoogan> gg

[1:38:06] <ElenaManetta> gg? TOXIC
[1:38:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> PANDA
[1:38:08] <MickeyMoore13> Speaking of music, what's the best soundtrack from any Tekken?
[1:38:11] <APB_Harleqyn> Yo - but where is that Snoop Dog Tekken song??? :P
[1:38:14] <peachy996> I mean Jin
[1:38:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Moonlit Wilderness for all stage and menu music
[1:38:16] <%Rezca> Why doesn't the PC version have it?
[1:38:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> give panda your energy
[1:38:22] <razielhex> @nohat1375 Friday Night Fisticuffs
[1:38:25] <davey0000> PC doesn’t have the Tekken 4 Jin costume and that makes it literally unplayable
[1:38:43] <leontaich> Lili huh LUL
[1:38:43] <peachy996> @MickeyMoore13 Tekken Tag 1, Tekken 5, Tekken 3 and Tekken 4
[1:38:51] <spawnvagrant> Tekken 3 has the best soundtrack imo, Tekken 1 2nd place
[1:39:01] <+WickCastle> rey mysterio

[1:40:44] <lem______> gon was super banned
[1:40:44] <razielhex> Dr. B also was the one that repaired Bryan Fury and worked for Yoshimitsu
[1:40:45] <MickeyMoore13> #GonForSmash
[1:40:46] <peachy996> Dr. B is memes but I found one thing and it's a nightmare for Steve players
[1:40:51] <%PlumpPotatoRump> G clef
[1:40:54] <spawnvagrant> Gon had a crazy hitbox as you can imagine, it was impossibl
[1:40:58] <leontaich> Don't respect Lilli too much
[1:40:59] <peachy996> His Punch Parry gives Steve a very hard time
[1:41:05] <leontaich> Otherwise she'll mix yo uup into oblivion
[1:41:10] <peachy996> Because Steve is 90% punch
[1:41:23] <%UrsulaCat> @woolieversus please some Reggie lore my crops are dying

[2:00:01] <peachy996> b2 is amazing in Tag 2
[2:00:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> So when's Alex coming back to tekken?
[2:00:07] <DSD24> Man this Armor King costume is cool
[2:00:19] <IsNotJesus> Bob's worse than he was in T6/TTT2 but he's still pretty decent? I haven't seen any tournament presence from him

[2:03:07] <+TheObliviousAdobo> @WoolieVersus Yoshi's aggression is super risky so can just let them kill themselves usually.

[2:06:44] <peachy996> I was the stupid gimmicky Yoshimitsu lol
[2:06:46] <$konekoryugamine> I'm jumping between this and Shofu playing Jump Force. It's . . . still interesting.

[2:07:16] <@Menitta> Whens getting into fighting games Saltybet Kappa
[2:07:16] <+Answer_Moose> @MickeyMoore13 you right
[2:07:17] <Wofoeh> Lei to me is like a Yoshi, on the right hands he’s TERRIFYING
[2:07:18] <$konekoryugamine> Hie hair looks like Gumby was melted and then reformed before being left out to dry for punishment
[2:07:24] <razielhex> Dong Dong Never Die! has both a Bruce Lee & Jackie Chan
[2:07:25] <+TheObliviousAdobo> @WoolieVersus Lei is extremely weak against 2D characters due to projectiles having the ability to force him out of stance.
[2:07:32] <Sorubr0> Jump Force is garbo
[2:07:35] <Ben_Ben817> That Ha Ha step
[2:07:36] <peachy996> When I play Yoshi you have to force me to think and strategize i
[2:07:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> it is
[2:07:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's the pretzel motion
[2:07:53] <$konekoryugamine> I'm not gonna jump, that's the mind game!
[2:08:04] <KeiPrime> yeah pretzel is in this one
[2:08:04] <%laserbeaming> It is the pretzel, it's what keeps me from playing geese
[2:08:10] <harris2210> Damn haha step
[2:08:12] <KeiPrime> its NOT pretzel in kof14 which is confusing
[2:08:13] <DeebzNutz100> 3 bars isnt it?
[2:08:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's also 3 bars
[2:08:38] <redman5> its pretzel, needs full bar
[2:08:50] <peachy996> I got big excited and went ham
[2:08:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> now pretzel motion
[2:08:51] <+Answer_Moose> THAT'S PROMPTO
[2:09:01] <MickeyMoore13> Prompto is a human Chocobo
[2:09:03] <+Answer_Moose> Also a chocobo
[2:09:03] <redman5> pretzel is very lenient
[2:09:06] <Wofoeh> @laserbeaming if you land it once you can land it consistently
[2:09:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It's both
[2:09:07] <peachy996> Did they get lag on their end when I played Yoshimitsu?
[2:09:08] <%PlumpPotatoRump> prompto, chokobo the same thing reAlly

[2:10:28] <+Omegasinnocence> I just call it red shit and blue shit
[2:10:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's faster for shorthand
[2:10:46] <peachy996> Oddly enough X-Rays in MK are used before Supers
[2:10:47] <+jetjagger222> jim kazama

[2:13:49] <peachy996> No Armor King was in Tag 1
[2:13:54] <harris2210> No
[2:13:57] <petpurplepanda> Tag 1
[2:14:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[2:14:09] <kaine_west> Use Rage Drives for plus frames Wools
[2:14:15] <skewerstar> SPD! SPD! SPD! SPD!
[2:14:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> technically AMK was in Tekken 3 only in the endings, where he DIED
[2:14:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> he was technically dead until the drunk brother took on the mantle
[2:14:27] <+TheObliviousAdobo> He was in Tekken 5 DR onward for canon main games.
[2:14:32] <%PlumpPotatoRump> in tekken 1 he was a heihachi clone. thats why he hs dark upper xS
[2:14:34] <peachy996> That is true he was in Tekken endings
[2:14:38] <Kenny_Riot> Only Mexicans die in Tekken
[2:14:42] <harris2210> Tekken 3 king 2 wears aka mask as a homage

[2:15:18] <peachy996> Armor King 1 was killed by Marduk, King 1 was killed by Ancient Ogre
[2:15:22] <kaine_west> use the grab mix-ups you're AK Woolie
[2:15:23] <skewerstar> @kaine_west AK's Rage drive is kinda finnicky to use though... unless Woolie's good at CDs.
[2:15:26] <+TheObliviousAdobo> I played Tekken 5 but never DR so I was super confused to hear AK was in Tekken 5 for a time.

[2:19:29] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[2:19:29] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 31 minutes
[2:19:29] <Kenny_Riot> Woolie, Tekken is the best music in Fighting Games, period.
[2:19:34] <+jetjagger222> T5/DR best overall
[2:19:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> Tekken 7.... eeeh i'm not feeling the OST as much compared to the older games
[2:19:39] <+TheObliviousAdobo> G corp Night feels like the one mistake Tekken 7 made though
[2:19:42] <stopmakinsense94> tag 2 or 5 best soundtrack
[2:19:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> not entirely, but 7 still has some good ones
[2:19:44] <KeiPrime> yeah but 7's music,... yeesh
[2:19:49] <+jetjagger222> 3rd round on this has to be DR OST
[2:19:50] <%Lord0Mugen> Killer Instinct

[2:20:22] <+Answer_Moose> So I've been wondering this, why does it seem to be so bright in Woolies room there. Is that just the brightness of his TV?

[2:20:55] <+TheObliviousAdobo> @Guntanks_in_Space It's not even an objectively bad song but the issue is when playing a game is you have to keep listening to it. That's not the kind of music most people can handle listening to for too long.
[2:20:55] <+jetjagger222> yeah it does sound like that
[2:20:59] <+jetjagger222> its very ZOE-ish

[2:49:30] <@Solidus_113> my local mall had a wall full of them for like $120 each
[2:49:43] <+jetjagger222> 120 USD?
[2:49:44] <+ItsCarsonBluh> ew
[2:49:47] <+Answer_Moose> Shit every brand had bootleg things of it though.
[2:49:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @jetjagger222 you mean the ones YoVideogames wears for Anime Saturdays?

[2:50:42] <%UrsulaCat> haha your money is a joke
[2:50:55] <@Menitta> does this work? I hope this works
[2:50:58] <%KingLlama1> it smells like maple syrup though !!!
[2:51:00] <@Menitta> !game Rising Thunder
[2:51:01] <@Moobot> The category was set to "Rising Thunder"
[2:51:05] <@Menitta> sick
[2:51:11] <+ItsCarsonBluh> bruh, thje shirt with the main character from sao. it says "recardless"
[2:51:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Answer_Moose to me it's the protection, respect, show no mercy one
[2:51:24] <jamaicanboy0209> has stream started?
[2:52:01] <@Menitta> ok there it goes
[2:52:01] <+Answer_Moose> @Admiral_PopnFresh I think it's the special kind of twisted one for me. But all of these seem to have a fedora requirement attached to them
[2:52:26] <%Fiend95> So what happened to Rising Thunder ever since Riot bought it?
[2:52:39] <@Menitta> it became open source
[2:52:42] <+gessho> What are these awfiul shirts
[2:52:52] <+ItsCarsonBluh> i kinda like the pain shirt
[2:52:52] <@Solidus_113> YEYEYEYEYEEE
[2:52:54] <%itsjustdoogan> wb
[2:53:20] <+Answer_Moose> @gessho They're real I think, and you can probably get them at your local Hot Topic.
[2:53:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Answer_Moose not suave enough for Fedora, I think a military beret feels more apt for someone wanting to exude an "attitude"
[2:53:26] <+Artdog_01> God Rugal or Sol Badguy would be nice in Tekken too as a fighting guest mecha
[2:53:54] <+gessho> oh it's clear they're real just wondering who would unironically wear them @Answer_Moose
[2:54:11] <@Solidus_113> Rising Thunder has no motions, attacks are based on distance and directions
[2:54:18] <+Answer_Moose> @gessho Anyone that regularly wears a fedora.
[2:54:39] <+Answer_Moose> @gessho They might also be a bronie
[2:54:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:55:18] <%OmegaWeltall> yea realy, i like robots
[2:55:26] <+WhyIDie> one must fall SwiftRage
[2:55:32] <@Menitta> depends on the design imo
[2:55:35] <Laironx3> I relate to robutts MrDestructoid
[2:55:37] <%KingLlama1> waifus > robots > man men
[2:55:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> If you have a shooter game, it becomes vastly more interesting for it to be robots shooting than people
[2:55:50] <+Answer_Moose> Is Jensen a robot or a human at this point.
[2:55:55] <%Solidnick18> i love robutts
[2:55:55] <Bionicghost> hey guys, remember Turbo Teen?

[2:56:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Kathariya Latin America will always keep KOF alive
[2:56:39] <+sentaiStriker> Yeah, KOF's update was great
[2:56:45] <+sentaiStriker> I hope the series keeps going
[2:56:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> people trashed KOF XIV without even playing it and it kinda hurts lol
[2:56:45] <Bionicghost> if you don't know about turbo teen, google it. N O W
[2:56:55] <+Nomicro4u> Jigger please

[3:03:02] <JackalopeHerd> I've been waiting for news about they had been working on since they were bought by Riot. But we haven't heard news since 2016

[3:09:42] <+bizzer10> Do you ever play Smash? This game looks cool tho.
[3:09:43] <Quikanims> I see people compare this game to sf4 but it seems much faster
[3:10:04] <razielhex> TTK is much lower
[3:10:06] <DeathByPoke7> the music is good too
[3:10:27] <+WhyIDie> SourPls

[3:12:02] <+jetjagger222> play training room
[3:12:08] <razielhex> is that last robot embedded with the glorious red star of the proletariat?
[3:12:26] <Triplicat> remember that time the audio cut out on a tournament stream and Yipes/Lee Chung did a capella SFX
[3:12:39] <Triplicat> that was definitely SF5
[3:12:49] <BeNiceImShy> I guess that's the benefit of there being no top players
[3:13:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh man they adlibbed even the hit and crush counter noises lol
[3:13:11] <jubejube56> lol there are still top players just no scene for them to shine
[3:13:13] <+GunterDriger6> Bro!
[3:13:20] <Triplicat> @Guntanks_in_Space SeemsGood
[3:13:27] <Triplicat> CLING A LING A LING
[3:13:33] <%JackalopeHerd> you have a follow up after the uppercut
[3:13:57] <razielhex> He got hit by the crouch kick 11 times that round
[3:14:03] <$LuisKingKing> Play some of that royalty free spongebob ukulele music
[3:14:29] <razielhex> 9 times this round, he was hit with a crouching low kick
[3:14:37] <%JackalopeHerd> I really miss this game
[3:14:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> hell, KOF's Reynald was good at this too
[3:15:16] <jubejube56> crow jumping M cancels into jumping special 2
[3:15:22] <Triplicat> oh yeah
[3:15:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> i hope that local indie game Fchamp is helping with turns out good
[3:15:27] <Triplicat> slicuu loops
[3:15:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god the slice-u loops
[3:15:41] <jubejube56> lol yeah I know a few crows with stupid loops
[3:15:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:15:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> i expect Talos boot into EBROS
[3:15:57] <razielhex> Where's my hydrationbot update?
[3:16:16] <DeathByPoke7> GET THE DRINKS READY
[3:16:37] <donkey_b1tchass> !MOTIVATED
[3:16:37] <@Moobot> 94 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:16:37] <jubejube56> and then talos had his charge grab 50/50s
[3:16:47] <+cafefunk> This game actually looks super exciting, i wish there was some sort of demo
[3:16:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Okay, it's really cheesy, but you know what sound track is really good for this? Gunpla Build Fighters ost
[3:16:56] <+Sinoc229> there is
[3:17:05] <$LuisKingKing> It’s a shame what happened to this game
[3:17:06] <peachy996> Well I got work tomorrow morning so I'll see you folks later
[3:17:40] <jubejube56> lol well there is a version with a training mode, online, and local versus but you won't find too many people playing. Sort of a better demo
[3:17:43] <+cafefunk> Have a nice night @artthoubored
[3:17:43] <peachy996> Good games to all
[3:18:14] <+SimplesRock> Yay! I made it home for the fighter stream!
[3:18:36] <DeathByPoke7> you can advanced cancel the throws too
[3:18:40] <+cafefunk> Ooohh, i totally though this was Metal Revolution, whoops :p
[3:19:07] <jubejube56> riposte, you armour an attack and enter an auto dash, you can also jump straight up out ofit
[3:19:25] <lem______> netplay when?
[3:19:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> must be nice trying to remember the Edge chains into slide wall bounce
[3:19:35] <+WhyIDie> doesn't hurt to flex a little every now and then
[3:19:36] <+damnitmcgarnicle> So what fighting games do they play weekly?
[3:19:44] <lem______> he has a manual charge
[3:19:46] <lem______> no attk
[3:20:00] <jubejube56> @Datwiseguy netplay exists but not many people playing
[3:20:03] <lem______> counter hasno actual attk i think
[3:20:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> @damnitmcgarnicle they change every other week
[3:20:12] <lem______> juri sf4 coutner
[3:20:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> also that DP should be multi-part
[3:20:36] <lem______> so every special 1 charge upgrades your special 2 with edge
[3:20:37] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Bummer. ill never be ready
[3:20:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> i know mashing on DP has follow-ups, and there's a second part to the single slash
[3:20:46] <DeathByPoke7> special 1 generates charges for special 2
[3:20:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> but you need to build up his meter
[3:21:14] <lem______> oh look, my favorite blender
[3:21:18] <jubejube56> special 3.3 causes wall bounce, special 1 variant 2 is the combo special on edge
[3:21:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Brad is the shit! pobeda!
[3:21:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Vlad*
[3:21:43] <%UrsulaCat> laika comrade hero dog

[3:22:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> also you can airdash/fly with Vlad don't forget
[3:22:24] <jubejube56> there is actually a story sort of
[3:22:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> though you gotta pay attention to his fuel gauge lol
[3:22:27] <@Solidus_113> woolieYE
[3:22:29] <lem______> more shinsho but ok

[3:33:55] <BillieNoMates> This is why Greece is broke, Making swole bots for fighting competitions
[3:33:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Mexico kinda makes sense whe you think of the KOF scene, but Brazil is usually the Latin American Country of choice for fighting games

[3:43:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> these are the kind of players you can't just throw specials out
[3:44:02] <+PrincessLuna85> at the risk of repeating a question for the millionth time is this game still supported at all or is it purely LAN?
[3:44:18] <jubejube56> princess there is an online server
[3:44:20] <+PrincessLuna85> oh looking at the camera more only woolie is playing

[3:44:38] <danieldestructo2> There is an online server, but the game got no update anymore
[3:44:48] <DeathByPoke7> this game was so intuitive you could steal tech just by watching it once
[3:44:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PrincessLuna85 there is an online community on discord, if you scroll up, someone was here with a link, I think
[3:45:11] <+PrincessLuna85> i just got here i dont have a chat to scroll up for
