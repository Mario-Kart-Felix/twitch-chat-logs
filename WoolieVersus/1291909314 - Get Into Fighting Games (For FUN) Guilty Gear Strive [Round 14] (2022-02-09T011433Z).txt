[0:02:36] <+TopTieramisu> fuuuuuck
[0:02:50] <leith_aziz> Yikes. I feel on my rear once when skating
[0:02:54] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, hip injuries are scary
[0:02:54] <%Shad0wTag> @Asuterisuku probably the daylight
[0:03:04] <OldManDeckardCain> why didn't you ukemi tho
[0:03:06] <leith_aziz> And yeah, it was painfull. Luckily, nothing got damaged
[0:03:06] <+RD_NX> That's why I play Kula Kappa
[0:03:17] <Vaunno> @asuterisuku don't mind the light, it's his guardian angel Kappa
[0:03:20] <%crybirb> Yo I feel that, I fell other day and hurt pretty bad and I was like "yo I fell like this at least twice a week when I was 20 and nothing happened"
[0:03:22] <+TopTieramisu> the older you are, the greater your hollowing gets
[0:03:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie fro looking clean today

[0:03:44] <%riffsofdylheim> fealing real sad about it
[0:03:46] <BlackermanZX> i hope hes good
[0:03:52] <+sandwichtaker> Those halo LPs were amazing
[0:04:07] <Asuterisuku> Wishing him all the best!
[0:04:15] <kikoeru_san> He's gotta do this thing, a lot happened
[0:04:20] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Y'all did some good work together and I'm excited to see more of his own stuff going forward
[0:04:33] <Awesome_Leaf> just got here,what video is this?
[0:04:36] <%Theycallmenerf> I’m guessing this is about Little V Mills?
[0:04:42] <+TopTieramisu> honestly, can't blame him
[0:04:43] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus You looked like you had fun with V and vice versa and it showed. It was great while you were able to have him!
[0:04:49] <prime_name> some people just can't read the room sometimes man
[0:04:53] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Yes
[0:04:53] <kikoeru_san> wait really? I love V, how can you not
[0:05:00] <leith_aziz> Do you two work on the subreddit? Im a bit out of the loop
[0:05:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @kikoeru_san some people suck man
[0:05:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:15] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I assume its a all fan run
[0:05:27] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Like the fan discord
[0:05:33] <SpookyBeef7> Man, why does Reddit have to find new ways to make everything shitty?
[0:05:35] <%Theycallmenerf> @shad0wtag I hope he comes back. I like his covers and music but he was an absolute gem to have when Woolie Vs Kotor 2 happened and the Halo LPs.
[0:05:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it was great while it lasted but yeah, his decision is completely reasonable
[0:05:36] <BlackermanZX> gotta destroy the Wan guys
[0:05:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @leith_aziz I believe the subreddit is a community run thing after TBFP finished.
[0:05:39] <kikoeru_san> fucking one guy dude, fuck that guy
[0:05:45] <%solracc25> psaBig woolieONEGUY
[0:05:47] <leith_aziz> I get that. Shitty opinions can really ruin my day
[0:05:52] <+TopTieramisu> i HATE that sentiment
[0:05:56] <Asuterisuku> I would love to see you return to Yakuza though.
[0:05:57] <Vaunno> goddam
[0:05:59] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf No of course 100% the same. In the meantime we can enjoy what we had right?
[0:06:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @leith_aziz i've seen woolie and pat occasionally on the subreddit, but it's run by fans
[0:06:01] <kikoeru_san> Bitch what the fuck? someone said that shit dude
[0:06:04] <%MelBrooksKA> r/TBFP is fan run, Woolie and Pat read through it sometimes
[0:06:06] <+TopTieramisu> viewers acting like managers
[0:06:08] <Asuterisuku> I'm about a third through LAD now and it is WILD.
[0:06:09] <BlackermanZX> i hope that one guy falls on ice and breaks someting
[0:06:16] <%Irridium> why they gotta talk like a boomer talking to a service worker
[0:06:26] <leith_aziz> Which is why GG subreddit is hit/miss. But on a more serious note, it's genuinely saddening to hear what happened here
[0:06:31] <prime_name> thats a real friend
[0:06:36] <BlackermanZX> why is the subreddit always a toxic shithole
[0:06:39] <+theoldone001> Some people in the community got weird after SBFP, gatekeeping and being toxic for no reason.
[0:06:44] <%Theycallmenerf> @shad0wtag Yes, I always ask coworkers if they have heard of Kotor at all and I send playlists of BFP Kotor 1 and Woolie Vs Kotor 2.
[0:06:47] <%MelBrooksKA> @BlackermanZX It's not
[0:06:52] <Asuterisuku> @BlackermanZX Because Reddit is always a toxic shithole.
[0:07:00] <kikoeru_san> the subreddit isn't always a shit hole, just one guys ruining shit
[0:07:09] <leith_aziz> @BlackermanZX Yakuza Subreddit is pretty nice if im honest
[0:07:13] <leith_aziz> Pretty chill
[0:07:13] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Yakuza 0 REBOOT
[0:07:16] <%riffsofdylheim> oh pleasseee do
[0:07:17] <Vaunno> reddit one guys WeirdChamp the worst kind
[0:07:19] <+Tonytehgreat> who are they talking about?
[0:07:27] <%MelBrooksKA> Little V
[0:07:28] <kikoeru_san> the GG sub is cool, aside from the weird roleplayers
[0:07:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Tonytehgreat V
[0:07:36] <%ChoculaUltra> ok fine - but Reggie has to dress up like Majima now LUL
[0:07:39] <Asuterisuku> Find out why the Empty Lot is important
[0:07:46] <+TopTieramisu> a game's subreddit is not like a subreddit about internet personalities
[0:07:58] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus you REALLY wanna find out about that empty lot
[0:08:07] <+theoldone001> At least he's still in the outro!
[0:08:26] <+gupple_> gupple_ subscribed with Prime. 
[0:08:29] <kikoeru_san> let's not forget, Pat is always in the shadows waiting for COVID to end so that he may return to the Woolie hole
[0:08:34] <leith_aziz> From what I've checked out, Halo subreddit is a shitstorm, Guilty Gear, Yakuza and God Of War is the most chill I've found there
[0:08:49] <+TopTieramisu> @kikoeru_san i wouldn't be so sure. i think pat loves his quarantine hole
[0:08:55] <kikoeru_san> shhhh
[0:09:07] <thenomad177> @leith_aziz god the gg subreddit is so damn funny
[0:09:13] <Vaunno> guilty gear subreddit rp-ers tho WutFace
[0:09:21] <Asuterisuku> LUL Majima is the best.
[0:09:22] <leith_aziz> Majima's great. Wont spoil why of course
[0:09:36] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @kikoeru_san I feel like Pat and Woolie streaming probably won't cross over except for the next DMC lol

[0:11:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> these undertale-likes have the most one guys for some reason
[0:11:48] <kikoeru_san> rumor also has it that if you shoot them they stop talking
[0:11:52] <leith_aziz> There's a difference between out of context one guy and geuine one guy
[0:11:54] <BlackermanZX> and thats why 1000 year timeouts exist wooliePOYO

[0:12:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Diplomacy has failed
[0:12:38] <leith_aziz> We can be civil, but you gotta take the first step, one guy cohhFee
[0:12:40] <kikoeru_san> @th3smartalec it was never an option tbh
[0:12:46] <%LastHazzerd> Strive to do good
[0:12:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> all taht aside, Baiken thighs
[0:12:52] <thenomad177> perhaps a macth or two of fighting games
[0:12:56] <+NYCrownlessKing> we can't be civil if uz a biitchhh
[0:12:59] <Vaunno> @kosorsomesaykosm_ at some point it has to change from "one guy" to "all guys", man
[0:13:07] <leith_aziz> PC is a blessing
[0:13:12] <cerazor01> The Woolie Burpers show
[0:13:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> and also mods
[0:13:43] <leith_aziz> Strive mods are insanely impressive. You can do so much with UE4.
[0:13:43] <+McSoliace> tbf its like a frame more between the two
[0:13:45] <kikoeru_san> Woolie you play pad for Gear right?
[0:13:50] <%Irridium> baiken's got a Gintoki from Gintama recolor
[0:13:51] <@Menitta> the console version doesn't have a mod that replaced COUNTER with the Taco Bell noise.
[0:13:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Vaunno I feel like it almost was "all guys" for a while with some of these games
[0:13:56] <%Irridium> mods godlike
[0:13:56] <%Shad0wTag> Its fine dude no worries!
[0:14:01] <sirstriker0> Speaking of FG's if you were away earlier; a queue system is something I'd highly recommend for viewer matches
[0:14:18] <%Irridium> @Menitta Got mine replaced with the TF2 Engineer "Nope" voiceline.
[0:14:18] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I prefer either replacing Counter with that voicline from random characters in GG, Or Joesph's OHHH NOOOOO
[0:14:19] <+CANDIDfellow> give us cross play arcsys
[0:14:23] <kikoeru_san> Sol's Terry mods are dope as FUCK

[0:14:47] <%LastHazzerd> good work men
[0:14:49] <sirstriker0> Anyway I'm assuming Woolie is still playing Bacon
[0:14:52] <kikoeru_san> Console doesn't have Ed edd and Eddy HPB fx
[0:14:59] <@Menitta> my shilling skills know no bounds.
[0:15:01] <%JetpackMcQuack> bad times for everybody
[0:15:04] <+TopTieramisu> reggie researching tether combos against baiken
[0:15:11] <leith_aziz> Weight I'd say if you mean general combos
[0:15:14] <kikoeru_san> oh yeah, May is a pain to combo
[0:15:19] <Vaunno> thinking about smash twitter "shouldve teched" tweets again :/
[0:15:29] <leith_aziz> pickyAYAYA
[0:15:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh it's Baiken mirrors ALL DAY
[0:15:39] <leith_aziz> Well, good thing they actually stuck to Baiken for once
[0:15:42] <kikoeru_san> man, I've played so many Baikens
[0:15:47] <sirstriker0> The heavy characters make a lot of her combos a bit tighter to do
[0:15:47] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @Bromosap1ens
[0:15:51] <Doodicus110> Oops, all Baiken
[0:15:53] <@Menitta> not from me, I'll be sticking with Millia
[0:16:09] <@Menitta> I wanna learn Jack O
[0:16:10] <kikoeru_san> My friend picked up Baiken and I'm scared, not the online ones, just him
[0:16:17] <leith_aziz> Jack-O players who came in from the pose meme left 5 minutes in after seeing Jack-O gameplay
[0:16:18] <+TopTieramisu> the moment baiken becomes more accessible is the moment strive's playerbase becomes baiken dominated forever
[0:16:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:16:26] <sirstriker0> You got a license for that DLC character?
[0:16:30] <%polothegreatest> woolieF Baiken?
[0:16:42] <%Gigmunch> I already have over 100 wins against baiken lol and only 47 against AXL lol
[0:16:49] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu That would have happened with any GG if people knew how to play Baiken. So this is natural
[0:16:56] <Vaunno> now they can finally play one handed
[0:16:56] <kikoeru_san> you wanna play Happy, okay do you like having wrist problems
[0:17:01] <+BoBoGaijin> 🥓
[0:17:03] <@Menitta> I was running sets a bunch last night with my two friends. one plays baiken, the other plays Nago so bases covered LUL
[0:17:09] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu that's what i mean. the baiken stans now won't be scared off
[0:17:15] <leith_aziz> Or you can be Romolla and smoke people with Chaos
[0:17:15] <%crybirb> I stopped Strive due to trauma of fighting Axl
[0:17:16] <+Teelor32> baiken mains take their training seriously by always playing one handed Kappa
[0:17:19] <kikoeru_san> @menitta I'm so sorry lol
[0:17:23] <BlackermanZX> man after this we will probably gonna get zoner Asuka
[0:17:25] <Zephyr1989> I gtg. too much too soon! sorry!
[0:17:30] <sirstriker0> Might be turning into Baiken country at this point
[0:17:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> split the difference
[0:17:31] <Zephyr1989> gl hf!
[0:17:34] <wiffernubbin> I just need Johnny
[0:17:37] <kikoeru_san> like Baiken AND Nago
[0:17:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if the last character is Asuka then Baiken might be the only more traditional character in the dlc which is pretty funny
[0:17:40] <leith_aziz> Yeah, Baiken became my prime main now. You'll still be my pocket main, Sol
[0:17:42] <Vaunno> Jam Gang
[0:17:59] <@Moobot> Enough with the emojis @Bromosap1ens
[0:18:05] <leith_aziz> Last DLC character is gonna drop with a lot of stuff
[0:18:06] <kikoeru_san> Jam gang for life, I don't play her, but my homie does and I want him to be happy
[0:18:08] <sirstriker0> Some of those are really funny to watch
[0:18:13] <leith_aziz> ZA WARUDO X2
[0:18:14] <+TopTieramisu> every combo video is gonna be dominated by anti-baiken tethers
[0:18:16] <@Menitta> Millia's hair car is WILD while tethered
[0:18:20] <kikoeru_san> all the Axl Bomber
[0:18:36] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus Baiken is HOT
[0:18:43] <+JustToWatch> I am fond of the gold burst double hpb combo
[0:18:44] <%Irridium> I've been playing Baiken all week
[0:18:45] <leith_aziz> Sol comboing from super straight is kinda funny
[0:18:45] <@Menitta> nah Millia is the shit
[0:18:53] <@Menitta> She's dope
[0:19:00] <kikoeru_san> But Reggie, Baiken has titties and one arm
[0:19:07] <kikoeru_san> also swird
[0:19:10] <+pjams18> pjams18 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:19:10] <leith_aziz> Millia? She's dope, I dont blame you.

[0:19:11] <+TopTieramisu> millia can do things with hair
[0:19:16] <BlackermanZX> but millia also has tities and has TWO arms
[0:19:18] <Asuterisuku> I'm considering playing her but I also really like Gio and I-No
[0:19:19] <CruxAustralis> !MOTIVATED
[0:19:19] <@Moobot> @CruxAustralis 2504 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:19:34] <kikoeru_san> Millia? OP? lol
[0:19:35] <OldManDeckardCain> even lk picks up different characters now
[0:19:35] <%crybirb> Millia gameplay is way more hype than Baiken
[0:19:36] <Vaunno> millia downplayers intentionally withholding good counterpoints
[0:19:39] <leith_aziz> D:
[0:19:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think I might switch to Baiken until Jam comes out
[0:19:43] <%Irridium> in heaven dancing all over my ass that's where Millia is
[0:19:47] <sirstriker0> Yeah he has a pocket Axl vs Potemkin
[0:19:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> hair characters rise up

[0:20:09] <leith_aziz> Sol Far S cohhEvil
[0:20:26] <%crybirb> yeah except Axl because the character was made to grief others
[0:20:27] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta As a Pot main that is EXACTLY how it feels on floor 10
[0:20:37] <leith_aziz> Oh you mean negatives? For Sol it'd be uhhhh...
[0:20:46] <BlackermanZX> dunno every Nago matchup looks like hell cuz of the blood pop up
[0:20:46] <kikoeru_san> fuck Ky, all my homies hate Ky (cept for the guy that plays him)
[0:20:50] <@Menitta> also her theme is THE BEST IN THE GAME  I will not elaborate.
[0:20:54] <Asuterisuku> Sol's weakness is too many options.
[0:21:00] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta 100%
[0:21:09] <kikoeru_san> @asuterisuku that and range
[0:21:14] <leith_aziz> @kikoeru_san I dislike Ky gameplay, I like Ky lore. That makes me a coinflip? pickyShrug
[0:21:16] <+TopTieramisu> put darli in GG
[0:21:17] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus chipp mirrors are hilarious shit's always fun
[0:21:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Jam mirror is a 3/7 matchup csbeastYeyeye csbeastYeyeye
[0:21:26] <%Irridium> Axl mirror's are fuckin' stupid man
[0:21:28] <+Revorger> Pot v. Pot mirrors are a hoot
[0:21:34] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Hard for a best when I wanna say the same for 10 other songs
[0:21:35] <OldManDeckardCain> darli mirrors in kof 15 LUL
[0:21:36] <+JustToWatch> I love Pot mirrors, fighting over the 1 braincell
[0:21:38] <Saltmeisterr> Elliana mirrors monkaS
[0:21:44] <leith_aziz> Sol mirrors are the funniest
[0:21:45] <0cash> Mirrors mess with my pride
[0:21:47] <kikoeru_san> Sol mirrors are fun, we all play so different
[0:21:54] <+Teelor32> there's a combo with nago i love doing and it's tough because it leaves me real close to blood rage
[0:21:58] <leith_aziz> We start playing dumber and doing the same shit at teh same time
[0:22:09] <kikoeru_san> Some Sols are grounded, some are airborne, some are brain dead
[0:22:25] <+TopTieramisu> the best mirror matches are with characters that are more balanced
[0:22:26] <%Shad0wTag> Man Strive is such a good ass game.
[0:22:27] <Vaunno> @saltmeisterr snake mech char? or am i getting my wires crossed here
[0:22:30] <@Menitta> the best theme in Strive is the last one you listened to
[0:22:34] <%crybirb> all sols are braindead
[0:22:44] <%Lunalios> all are flinging shit and gorilla warcries
[0:23:02] <leith_aziz> @crybirb You say that untill a Sol gets a TOD hitconfirm off of Kara DP pickyStare
[0:23:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> battle plans
[0:23:36] <@Menitta> Also I fixed my PC and that slowdown won't happen this time.
[0:23:37] <kikoeru_san> Sol is simple to play, hard to master, his combos are weight dependent and difficult to maximize
[0:23:42] <atomicxdj> sup guys, hoping to see more baiken matches
[0:23:48] <bonechamp4lyfe> fighting games will never be fun for casuals
[0:23:51] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta What happened?
[0:23:55] <kikoeru_san> Sync test time, 1,2,3
[0:23:57] <%crybirb> @leith_aziz that doesn't make the sol player a poet like Slayer players
[0:23:59] <atomicxdj> SeemsGood
[0:24:14] <leith_aziz> Sol has a straightforward gameplan, but is also very versatile and has a long skill celling. He's pretty great in Strive
[0:24:14] <Vaunno> Prof Woolie's first lesson
[0:24:24] <DSD24> Where's the likes
[0:24:25] <@Menitta> So if you set the PC version to 4k, a reeaaally bad slowdown will happen on counter hit
[0:24:29] <%Shad0wTag> @bonechamp4lyfe Thats not true, it is fun for casuals. The idea idea is trying to get across to casuals all the stuff that awaits them if want to improve
[0:24:31] <@Menitta> it was weeeiird
[0:24:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:24:35] <%UnbreakableDoof> UnbreakableDoof is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel! 
[0:24:36] <kikoeru_san> I've made some combos, people seem to be having a hard time with them
[0:24:36] <+CheyMix> 4 players??
[0:24:36] <%UnbreakableDoof> UnbreakableDoof gifted a Tier 1 sub to nimu290!

[0:24:38] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Ooof dude thats rough
[0:24:46] <Vaunno> damn they STILL havent fixed the 4k bug
[0:24:49] <%Holycow8498> @UnbreakableDoof Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:24:49] <%AllenDeadman> click baiting the combos
[0:24:53] <%Theycallmenerf> So labbing, should be a first to do when getting into a fighting game? I had a period where I always bought the new MK game and me and a friend would just play matches against each other over and over. Super fun, is PC the best platform currently for fighting games?
[0:24:54] <DSD24> Tag Vanilla?
[0:24:55] <kikoeru_san> I WISH I could just search by Sajam
[0:25:02] <sirstriker0> I wish you could search by button too
[0:25:05] <@Menitta> There was an update this past week and it still didn't fix it
[0:25:10] <leith_aziz> @bonechamp4lyfe I disagree. I jumped into Rev 2 as a casual, and it slowly became my favorite fighting game of all time pickyLove
[0:25:14] <%UnbreakableDoof> forgot to drop this for the DS playthrough and reggie smoking quelag and lautrec
[0:25:16] <DSD24> Aww yeah Millia time
[0:25:19] <Asuterisuku> I think my GPU might be dying, I can't run this at 1440 without stutter anymore.
[0:25:26] <leith_aziz> @Menitta The patch was for fixing all the new bugs
[0:25:29] <bonechamp4lyfe> losing 100 games in a row as a casual is not fun quit dreaming kid lol
[0:25:33] <%Lunalios> oneeHappy oneeHappy oneeHappy
[0:25:35] <kikoeru_san> awww yeeeeee, girl on girl ACTION lol
[0:25:36] <leith_aziz> BREAK A SPELL
[0:25:40] <leith_aziz> pickyVibing
[0:25:45] <%Shad0wTag> @bonechamp4lyfe Who are you calling a kid?
[0:25:55] <Vaunno> yeah, patch fixed stuff like HC's accidental nerf, still no 4k fix tho Sadge
[0:26:02] <kikoeru_san> mmmmm that cross up ain't safe Woolz
[0:26:14] <leith_aziz> I WANT A RANGE ROOVEEER! pickyVibing
[0:26:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[0:26:16] <gamefan6219> tits vs tits. who will win
[0:26:27] <DSD24> Nah Millia is all hips
[0:26:27] <Asuterisuku> It apparently fixed what happened when Baiken parried a strike and a projectile at the same time.
[0:26:29] <%Theycallmenerf> Baiken’s moves look fucking sick.
[0:26:29] <kikoeru_san> more like tits vs ass
[0:26:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @gamefan6219 us
[0:26:41] <kikoeru_san> you know Millia does her squats
[0:26:43] <sirstriker0> @Asuterisuku Maybe try upping the fan speed and messing with overclocking if you haven't already. Otherwise 1080p isn't that much of a downgrade
[0:26:45] <+TopTieramisu> it's hair vs hair
[0:26:51] <+TopTieramisu> and baiken's got her beat in volume there as well
[0:27:02] <+天使42199> @kikoeru_san baiken does too, look at those thighs
[0:27:05] <kikoeru_san> "I suuuuuck" *wins*
[0:27:10] <leith_aziz> Natural hair stays winning pickyStronk
[0:27:21] <0cash> i have so much trouble dealing with baikens offense still
[0:27:23] <%Theycallmenerf> How did Baiken lose her arm?
[0:27:25] <kikoeru_san> @angel42199 tru tru
[0:27:29] <@Menitta> Id like baiken's design a lot more if her tits weren't massive. there I said it
[0:27:30] <kikoeru_san> @theycallmenerf that man
[0:27:32] <Pookiedaexzile> I too am Horned up by the cartoons fellow nerds
[0:27:34] <DSD24> @Theycallmenerf I think a Gear took it?
[0:27:38] <Asuterisuku> We don't know.
[0:27:39] <+CheyMix> @Theycallmenerf when she was small when gears attacked
[0:27:44] <leith_aziz> @Theycallmenerf An attack by Gears killed her family and massively injured her when she was young
[0:27:45] <+TopTieramisu> counterpoint: look at baiken's sprite in the original GG
[0:27:54] <0cash> the chain mix up always gets me. I havent registered it yet that it isnt a low
[0:27:56] <%Shad0wTag> Now that we have Baiken outta the way, is she the last season pass character do we have one coming with the Another Story as well?
[0:28:02] <%Theycallmenerf> I gotta watch Woolie’s lore videos.
[0:28:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> [Baiken] - HATES -> ⚙️
[0:28:10] <Asuterisuku> There is one more character coming, @Shad0wTag
[0:28:20] <%Shad0wTag> @Asuterisuku Is that with the Another Story update?
[0:28:21] <Vaunno> @shad0wtag one more with the story dlc, ye
[0:28:27] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag 5 DLC characters are confirmed. There are leaks that point to certain characters, but im not gonna spoil
[0:28:37] <kikoeru_san> the Kabari cross up is like the Leo cross up, once you know to react it's not scary
[0:28:40] <%Shad0wTag> Aight chat realistically now that Baiken is here do you want a new character or a returning character>
[0:28:42] <%Shad0wTag> *?
[0:28:49] <DSD24> @Shad0wTag Testament?
[0:28:49] <BlackermanZX> GIMME JAM DAMMIT
[0:28:51] <Vaunno> IT'S GONNA BE ||Leopardon||
[0:28:58] <leith_aziz> Only thing left for teh Season 1 roadmap now is Another Story, 5th DLC character and the Digital Figures pickyPog
[0:28:58] <+CheyMix> @Shad0wTag were gonna have more new one 100%
[0:28:59] <+TopTieramisu> imagine they just put goku into dbfz
[0:29:01] <%polothegreatest> gear make dlc? woolieSHOOK
[0:29:03] <%Shad0wTag> @DSD24 Do you want Testament or do you just think he should be back?
[0:29:07] <%Theycallmenerf> @shad0wtag My vote is new because all of Guilty Gear is new to me. I love it’s art style.
[0:29:09] <Asuterisuku> @leith_aziz Another stage, too.
[0:29:11] <@Menitta> I'd take returning. two of them were new already so gimme johnny
[0:29:16] <DSD24> I'm never was good at Guilty Gear but I like Testament with his cool scythe
[0:29:16] <kikoeru_san> oh the grab input miss from Reggie
[0:29:16] <BlackermanZX> for real whens ABA tho
[0:29:20] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Thats a fair shout my guy!
[0:29:21] <%UnbreakableDoof> is anyone else seeing a weird screen tearing happening in a line above the face cam?
[0:29:21] <leith_aziz> I'll take any character. GG is dope
[0:29:30] <leith_aziz> Im also just invested in everyone
[0:29:36] <sirstriker0> People always say that about Leo's dash through, but I still can't react
[0:29:37] <DSD24> @Shad0wTag I mean any Testament in general would be cool
[0:29:41] <slipdog> @UnbreakableDoof thats just their aura
[0:29:43] <Asuterisuku> @UnbreakableDoof That's been consistent across their recordings for this game, it's weird.
[0:29:52] <slipdog> Ok yeah theres mad screen tearing
[0:29:59] <kikoeru_san> when's Sol 2.0, you know a new person has to hold the flame of corruption, hence new Sol
[0:30:04] <Vaunno> @unbreakabledoof i think they're on pc today, they play with vsync off to reduce input lag
[0:30:05] <@Menitta> I never touched Johnny in Xrd much. how different was he from AC+R
[0:30:06] <%Shad0wTag> I'm torn I'd like a returning character for to see the Strive glow up but at the same time, I think the new characters have been great.
[0:30:14] <leith_aziz> You can see Testament in teh credit section behind DIzzy. And this is teh first time he has a 3D model cohhNotes
[0:30:16] <%polothegreatest> Saw the tear woolieSHOOK wooliePOYO
[0:30:30] <%Theycallmenerf> Is strive a solid intro? Or the game before it? On PS4 a friend would share play the previous GG title and I would switch between a girl with an anchor and a blonde dude with a ghost.
[0:30:34] <Aussie_Manny> Give 'em the ol' raw super razzle dazzle. finoZasshu
[0:30:34] <leith_aziz> I will never undersell the cool factor of Chadlewis
[0:30:39] <%Theycallmenerf> *intro to GG games
[0:30:47] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Solid intro my guy
[0:30:47] <kikoeru_san> the shlide
[0:31:03] <+TopTieramisu> strive's the one to play. it's thriving right now
[0:31:04] <Vaunno> @theycallmenerf they're all great, but this one and +R have good online
[0:31:06] <Asuterisuku> Strive is somewhat more beginner friendly than Xrd is. That doesn't mean there isn't sauce though.
[0:31:12] <+Take_2_shots> Smooth playing on Reggie I haven't seen much Millia play on this game though admittedly I haven't really checked much out on this game at all.
[0:31:17] <kikoeru_san> at somepoint we're gonna get Dizzy and Sin
[0:31:23] <@Menitta> Strive is much more beginner friendly than Xrd
[0:31:24] <BlackermanZX> also Elphelt
[0:31:27] <%Theycallmenerf> Gonna get Strive, also gawt damn the Jack-O pose.
[0:31:29] <%Shad0wTag> Lets say if Testament or Johnny come back, would you like a redesign or just a straight up 1 for 1 from +R?
[0:31:31] <LorcaNomad> @Theycallmenerf story-wise no, gameplay-wise abso-fuckin-lutely, it's got very beginner friendly gameplay
[0:31:32] <slipdog> I'm downloading this rn, first GG ever wish me luck LUL im bout to get COOKED
[0:31:33] <+TopTieramisu> i'm praying for a greatly redesigned sin kiske
[0:31:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> Gio taught me how to play the basics, just picked up chaos
[0:31:48] <leith_aziz> @Theycallmenerf Strive is a great game to start the series with. Very active playerbase. Xrd Rev 2 has more content if you want that. And if you wanna be up to speed, Woolie has a lore-video
[0:31:52] <@Menitta> They really improved roman canceling in Strive from how it was in Xrd
[0:31:53] <kikoeru_san> @blackermanzx let's hope not, I'm not ready to experience what horrors I've heard about with El
[0:31:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the empty run into empty run mixup never fails
[0:31:59] <LorcaNomad> @Theycallmenerf definitely watch woolie's lore series if you want to know about the lore
[0:31:59] <leith_aziz> +R also has rollback. Xrd doesnt sadly
[0:32:05] <%Shad0wTag> @slipdog Enjoy buddy! if you get stuck there are plenty of resources and people in chat who will help!
[0:32:05] <@Menitta> It's a much more intuitive mechanic
[0:32:10] <Aussie_Manny> TATAMI GAI brodayRee
[0:32:13] <BlackermanZX> Elphelt is so damn popular she is gonna def come back at some point
[0:32:13] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Gameplay or aesthetic?
[0:32:24] <underwater_bear> Dat 6P
[0:32:25] <%Theycallmenerf> @lorcanomad That’s the plan, I’ll watch them when I start downloading GG Strive
[0:32:30] <%Shad0wTag> @Shad0wTag Just design wise for now
[0:32:32] <Asuterisuku> @Aussie_Manny Gaeshi*
[0:32:35] <big_oki> gold burst setups
[0:32:36] <Aussie_Manny> TATAMI GAESHI brodayRee
[0:32:44] <DSD24> The clash
[0:32:44] <0cash> reggie got them optmized combos
[0:32:44] <%Shad0wTag> Testament will be a nightmare to deal with all of his traps
[0:32:45] <xerotwo> C L A S H
[0:32:51] <slipdog> @slipdog dangDance
[0:32:55] <kikoeru_san> I'm kinda surprised Woolie doesn't have English on for the Nico Baiken
[0:33:00] <leith_aziz> I love it when a chat shares the enthusiasm with me about games I like cohhL
[0:33:06] <wandelmilch> @Shad0wTag if he has more than one in strive
[0:33:09] <+TopTieramisu> baiken's original voice is so good
[0:33:10] <Vaunno> @aussie_manny  the tatami guy coming over to do maintenance or...?
[0:33:14] <Aussie_Manny> nice combo
[0:33:15] <kikoeru_san> LOOK AT THE DAMAGE THO

[0:33:18] <DSD24> @leith_aziz Its a nice feeling!
[0:33:20] <%polothegreatest> Whos the ryu and ken equivalent? woolieCHAN
[0:33:22] <BlackermanZX> spicy damage
[0:33:25] <@Menitta> good burst
[0:33:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> is this the usual facecam placement for their Strive videos?
[0:33:27] <%Theycallmenerf> Since Microsoft is buying up companies, could it be possible for another Spartan to guest star in a fighting game franchise?
[0:33:32] <Aussie_Manny> Was that 75% of Millia's HP?!
[0:33:36] <%Shad0wTag> @Th3SmartAlec Yeah
[0:33:37] <DSD24> @polothegreatest That'd be Sol Badguy and Ky Kiske
[0:33:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> cut the hair
[0:33:56] <kikoeru_san> oh that's was a BAD burst woof
[0:34:00] <%polothegreatest> Those ill main then LUL
[0:34:01] <BlackermanZX> when are we gonna get the Sol Badguy (Labcoat) DLC
[0:34:04] <Asuterisuku> @Theycallmenerf If the KI rumours turn out to be true and Arbiter doesn't return I'll be a sad boy.
[0:34:04] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Like what franchise outside of KI?
[0:34:15] <sirstriker0> Sol is more of a rushdown character the standard Ryu/Ken esq character is Ky
[0:34:16] <@Menitta> God last night, I hit my friend with the HS Tandem Top and then opted to drop the mix up and block his burst. He was not happy I read that LUL
[0:34:23] <%phd_in_thuggery> phd_in_thuggery subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[0:34:26] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 Yeah. Allthough it's a double edged sword when a chat being on a bad mood can rub off on me. I need to better stand behind the things I like without influence from others cohhHmm
[0:34:48] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! Reggie rocking hair girl? I’m impressed

[0:35:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yo Reggie is bathed in elysian light right now
[0:35:59] <%Theycallmenerf> @shad0wtag I forgot Nicole-458 was in DOA4, I’d say just any title or IP now. Would love to see other companies styles for a Spartan to be in game, cannon or not.

[0:36:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> Reggie's been blessed
[0:36:31] <sirstriker0> PSA to anyone making combos; don't make them on DLC stage, people without it can do the trial if it's on one
[0:36:34] <kikoeru_san> Woolie, you got this, find the sauce inside yourself
[0:36:38] <@Menitta> KI is the most western anime fighter.
[0:36:46] <DSD24> This is a nice color for Millia
[0:36:53] <leith_aziz> pickyBang
[0:36:56] <sirstriker0> Can't*
[0:37:03] <Asuterisuku> KI is the most anime Western fighter.
[0:37:07] <0cash> oh wow
[0:37:08] <leith_aziz> That gun super never stops losing the impact of just pulling it out
[0:37:12] <kikoeru_san> @menitta KI the Powerhouse Castlevania of anime fighters
[0:37:16] <%Theycallmenerf> @asuterisuku Arby won’t be in KI? That would be a big letdown. Keith David is awesome.
[0:37:20] <Aussie_Manny> GOTTEM
[0:37:22] <Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[0:37:32] <Vaunno> swordfighter brings gunnto swordfight, remains undefeated
[0:37:32] <leith_aziz> @Theycallmenerf Keith David didnt voice Arbiter in KI
[0:37:34] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Quite certain they got a soundalike in KI
[0:37:52] <+TopTieramisu> what exactly is the pool of western fighting games, anyways? it's just KI and netherrealm games
[0:37:57] <%polothegreatest> KI is the avatar equivalent of fighting games then LUL LUL
[0:38:07] <Asuterisuku> @Theycallmenerf I mean the only rumour I'm aware of is that a new game is in development potentially by a Japanese studio. Anything beyond that is pure speculation.
[0:38:11] <%Theycallmenerf> I’d love for then use KI takes Arby, they use Keith David. I haven’t played KI before I just assumed Keith David voiced Arby in it.
[0:38:17] <DSD24> We livin
[0:38:17] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu There's the Power Rangers team, Them's Fighting Herd's, and that's about it
[0:38:17] <%Theycallmenerf> *them
[0:38:20] <Aussie_Manny> yooooo that air combo!
[0:38:20] <DSD24> aww
[0:38:26] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu Fantasy Strike, Brawlhalla, Rivals of Aether
[0:38:28] <0cash> AHAHA went for the counter, cheeky
[0:38:28] <Vaunno> ...project L? is that western enough?
[0:38:32] <+CryptusMaximus> @TopTieramisu The Power Rangers devs are legit
[0:38:39] <leith_aziz> But im not a fan of NRS anymore, so I'll stick to other options personally
[0:38:41] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie is SHINING now! literally
[0:38:43] <+TopTieramisu> i forgot about those
[0:38:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> God trying to blind Reggie with light
[0:38:47] <sirstriker0> @polothegreatest There are plenty of indie titles. Like Skullgirls and Punch Planet
[0:38:51] <%Theycallmenerf> Project L looks awesome.
[0:38:53] <%Shad0wTag> Them Fighting Herds and Skullgirls also
[0:38:55] <%TheQuadrupleS> You can jump out of Millia heavy disk after she throws right?
[0:39:01] <Aussie_Manny> @Th3SmartAlec wtf you're right
[0:39:06] <DSD24> Skullgirls is getting Black Dahlia too
[0:39:09] <leith_aziz> @TheQuadrupleS She can meaty with Jump K
[0:39:19] <kikoeru_san> Project L would be on my list, but fuck Riot, can't wait for the Cannon's next game
[0:39:20] <Aussie_Manny> This is bullshit, God is trying to blind Reggie to help Woolie win! bakami2Angy
[0:39:28] <leith_aziz> Reggie is BLINDED BY THE LIGHT!
[0:39:30] <+TopTieramisu> project L won't be out for a long while
[0:39:37] <%Theycallmenerf> Ekko will prob be a main. Has Miles Morales been in any MvC stuff? Are we gonna get a new MvC?
[0:39:46] <Asuterisuku> TK Yozansen is such a good AA though.
[0:39:53] <%TheQuadrupleS> @leith_aziz Ah so thats why been getting smoked by Millia's after getting to floor 10 LUL
[0:40:05] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Not really and god knows if Capcom feels like it and Disney wanna play ball
[0:40:07] <+TopTieramisu> i can imagine miles morales replacing peter parker in the next MvC
[0:40:10] <slipdog> what game is Project L gonna be a clone of? thats all i ever seen riot do
[0:40:23] <leith_aziz> As someone who's never touched a single Riot game, maybe I should keep my hands clean. Allthough im not exactly innocent with other companies either pickyLurk
[0:40:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:40:27] <Asuterisuku> @slipdog Are you familiar with the robot fighting game Rising Thunder?
[0:40:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Theycallmenerf Yeah it's in development right now... on GameBanana Kappa
[0:40:30] <leith_aziz> I'll think about it
[0:40:31] <+TopTieramisu> project L is being developed by the fantasy strike folks, right?
[0:40:36] <DSD24> @slipdog Marvel Vs Capcom 1? I think its assist based with tow characters
[0:40:37] <+TopTieramisu> or was it rising thunder
[0:40:41] <kikoeru_san> @slipdog Marvel Infinite and other 2man team fighters
[0:40:42] <LorcaNomad> !MOTIVATED
[0:40:42] <@Moobot> @LorcaNomad 2505 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[0:40:48] <@Menitta> Rising thunder. they bought that company
[0:40:53] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Rising Thunder
[0:40:53] <slipdog> Ohh a tag fighter makes sense
[0:40:55] <Vaunno> @slipdog its made by rising thunder guys iirc soooo
[0:40:56] <%Theycallmenerf> Disney does have infinite pockets at this point, I would like to see a new MvC. Always watched at parties in high school friends running fights, one guy chose Magneto and bodied a lot of matches.

[0:41:39] <0cash> i fear that grab
[0:41:49] <+TopTieramisu> imagine if disney has a clause that future MvC games must have the marvel characters be more OP than capcom's

[0:45:26] <Aussie_Manny> No, he meant Montreal, the Godless Region.
[0:45:48] <+TopTieramisu> when was the last time age was consistently addressed in a fighting game?
[0:45:56] <kikoeru_san> The BAIT
[0:45:58] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like it was tekken 3

[0:46:12] <Asuterisuku> @DSD24 We know that she's easily over 100 though.
[0:46:15] <Saltmeisterr> BLOCK DAT GLOCK
[0:46:18] <kikoeru_san> @dsd24 she probably is
[0:46:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DSD24 So, like, 17 in anime years
[0:46:38] <DSD24> @Asuterisuku True I forget that Guilty Gear has people living for hundreds of years
[0:46:39] <leith_aziz> GGST main site says her birthdate is March 5. Not much about the year of birth cohhNotes
[0:46:48] <%Lunalios> DAMN
[0:47:01] <sukeban_law> age in Guilty Gear romollaRomegalul
[0:47:08] <enerkaizer> yeah, but baiken is just a human, isn't she? so she can't do the century+ walk
[0:47:12] <Asuterisuku> ... I think she's older than Kliff was when he died, actually.
[0:47:15] <+TopTieramisu> so GG characters age like they're in a murim manhwa
[0:47:16] <+TopTieramisu> ?

[0:47:46] <leith_aziz> I dont think there's anything that confirms Baiken was around during the crusades. Allthough its interesting to think about. Anyway, I dont think she or Anji are over 100
[0:47:47] <Aussie_Manny> risky business
[0:47:47] <+LordAngry> bring the sun back
[0:47:52] <ChuckMagnus> Now he's uninhibited by the sun
[0:47:58] <Aussie_Manny> no sun johns
[0:47:59] <%Javaa01> @enerkaizer She's human, but Japanese, which means she's basically a superhuman by GG lore rules
[0:48:17] <%Javaa01> They are very dumb lore rules
[0:48:28] <+TopTieramisu> so japanese people are special in GG?
[0:48:33] <sirstriker0> Yes
[0:48:36] <sirstriker0> I think
[0:48:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:48:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Javaa01 Dumb lore rules? In MY anime fighting game?!
[0:48:39] <Vaunno> @toptieramisu maguc, basically
[0:48:41] <@Menitta> I can't believe Woolie is bullying Reggie immediately after retina damage.
[0:48:41] <+TopTieramisu> not surprising, but that's funny
[0:48:44] <Vaunno> Magic*
[0:48:45] <leith_aziz> Random thought, but I was just listening to Overture OST. That soundtrack still remains Top 5 in the series for me pickyVibing
[0:48:47] <Asuterisuku> They scared people so much they nuked the country into a crater.
[0:49:04] <DSD24> The parry
[0:49:07] <Vaunno> @leith_aziz top 1 ost, bottom 5 game lmao
[0:49:27] <Asuterisuku> May is also Japanese, and is also considerably older than she looks.
[0:49:30] <enerkaizer> Didn't strive or Xrd establish that there are only round about 1000 people of japanese descent left in the world?
[0:49:53] <DSD24> Yeah I thought May was in her 20s or something to that effect
[0:49:55] <%Javaa01> @enerkaizer Yeah there's basically one colony left
[0:49:56] <kikoeru_san> I think that Japanese characters in Gear have higher guts
[0:49:58] <+TopTieramisu> @Asuterisuku that's the most japanese tropey thing i've heard about GG

[0:50:00] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @enerkaizer Japan does not exist anymore, so yeah
[0:50:02] <leith_aziz> @enerkaizer It's likely. As stated, Japan was nuked and its inhabitants were rounded up in the colony to live there
[0:50:22] <kikoeru_san> there are multiple colonies by the by
[0:50:35] <stormhawk9891> The Cali burst
[0:50:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Asuterisuku eh, she's like 22 in Strive, so the age-looks discrepancy isn't so bad
[0:50:38] <+TopTieramisu> anyone read that oneshot made by miura and the guy who made HnK?
[0:50:44] <leith_aziz> Anji left the Colony becuase he got bored of the life there and wanted to sate his curioisity
[0:50:45] <DSD24> I like that Millia has a clipboard
[0:50:53] <%Lunalios> so they did Hiroshima 2?
[0:50:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @TopTieramisu Blaster Knuckle?
[0:51:01] <Asuterisuku> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ We don't actually know her age, Xrd's English VA doesn't count.
[0:51:09] <Vaunno> and then anji gets E N L I G H T E N E D
[0:51:11] <+TopTieramisu> granted it was made in the 80s i think when japan was in its econimic zenith, but it's pretty funny how it portrays japan
[0:51:16] <Asuterisuku> We just know Chipp was extremely surprised to hear it.
[0:51:22] <kikoeru_san> @lunalios yeah, but by turning everyone into monsters that are nukes
[0:51:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Asuterisuku pretty sure official strive sources said 22
[0:51:44] <DSD24> Get the frame data out
[0:51:49] <Vaunno> thicc ass flower
[0:52:00] <leith_aziz> May says her age to Chipp. You dont hear the exact number, but you can her her in japanese start with 20. I just go with 24 cohhNotes
[0:52:01] <kikoeru_san> oh Woolies going to dustloop
[0:52:04] <%badguy8312> hoo boy glad to catch yall
[0:52:15] <enerkaizer> I mean, from what I remember, Baiken witnessed the first major gear outbreak when she was a child. That at least was shown in I think GGX opening cinematic
[0:52:26] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu it's titled Japan
[0:52:33] <leith_aziz> Upper body invuln with 6P
[0:52:48] <%Lunalios> yeah
[0:52:56] <%Lunalios> gotta crouch
[0:53:05] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[0:53:18] <Asuterisuku> Millia's is particularly good.
[0:53:30] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu several japanese people get transported to a post apocalyptic, mad max-esque world where japan was destroyed and its people oppressed because of their contribution to climate change
[0:53:36] <slipdog> P? sajamSaint
[0:53:59] <leith_aziz> Pretty nice victory theme. Was used in Xrd
[0:54:16] <slipdog> i thought anime games used the same notation PoroSad
[0:54:16] <%mighty_max_t> Hey chat. Here's a question for you: is SoulsBorne PVP just a grounded Arena Fighter?
[0:54:20] <%badguy8312> badguy8312 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! hey woolie, this is the Amazon Bomber from the Catacombs in DS1. still working over there, things are a lot slower. also took the plunge and got myself some locs! mostly because of yours. can't wait till Reggie is back in the hot seat too! be easy
[0:54:28] <Vaunno> these are the perks of having a hairflower
[0:54:33] <+TopTieramisu> i don't know if it's a hot take, but souls pvp is just a bad fighting game
[0:54:35] <slipdog> @mighty_max_t grounded, and ridiculously unbalanced and high-downtime. but ya basically
[0:54:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[0:54:44] <+NMancy6> as much i've tried, i can't get into strive like i did Xrd
[0:54:49] <DSD24> I was never really into Souls pvp
[0:55:06] <Vaunno> @toptieramisu agree, but I'm bad and therefore my opinion is invalid
[0:55:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah if you try to play Souls PVP with a fighting game mindset, you'll just have a terrible time
[0:55:25] <leith_aziz> @NMancy6 I couldnt really get into +R as I did with Xrd and Strive. Different perks I guess
[0:55:38] <%Javaa01> It's about finding out broken BS, and throwing your hat into the ring to see how it measures up to the other completely broken stuff in the game
[0:55:47] <@Menitta> upwards red RC. interesting tactic
[0:55:58] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like souls pvp is more for the RPers that want to have battles than people that appreciate proper pvp mechanics
[0:56:06] <%crybirb> @NMancy6 Me too but Vanilla Xrd I also couldn't get into. I think in the first "super revamp" I'll be able to enjoy Strive better.
[0:56:19] <Saltmeisterr> jesus that parry
[0:56:19] <+NMancy6> i guess, though i didnt play much +R either
[0:56:21] <Saltmeisterr> wtf
[0:57:00] <Asuterisuku> Far parry is plus, but... Well, not THAT plus.
[0:57:07] <leith_aziz> @NMancy6 That's how Arcsys games usually work. The vanilla version is looked upon the least, and they only get better over time. Final revisions age like fine wine
[0:57:09] <DSD24> I like Baiken's pose after the parry
[0:57:48] <%mighty_max_t> Thanks, guys. Just something I was thinking about after Max's discussion last night about wanting indie fg devs to try a new take on fighting games
[0:58:08] <@Menitta> the parry is active 6 frames iirc
[0:58:09] <leith_aziz> I feel like Indie Games do that all the time wym=
[0:58:11] <leith_aziz> *?
[0:58:20] <+TopTieramisu> do you think strive will continue to have new updated versions that sell as seperate games or will they follow the sfv method and just keep it under the same name?
[0:58:31] <DSD24> @mighty_max_t I'd like more weapon based 3D fighters, I only really have SC and SC6 looks like its gonna be the last one for a bit
[0:58:33] <@Menitta> woooow
[0:58:38] <%polothegreatest> hope the latter
[0:58:40] <Aussie_Manny> YEET
[0:58:42] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu It will not be a new version sold seperatly. We're past that age
[0:58:50] <leith_aziz> It'll be Strive Season 2
[0:58:50] <+TopTieramisu> i hope so
[0:58:58] <Saltmeisterr> man this stage pretty
[0:58:59] <@Menitta> there's that sword fighting game by the Witcher devs
[0:59:03] <+NMancy6> which is weird, cause i never had a hard time with Sign or Rev when they dropped
[0:59:07] <%badguy8312> @toptieramisu they're already doing dlc in seasons, I think it's gonna be like Tekken and SF:
[0:59:09] <@Menitta> ex cdpr devs rather
[0:59:19] <DSD24> @Menitta Was that Hellish Quart?
[0:59:24] <%Javaa01> @TopTieramisu I mean, Arcsys has pretty much transitioned fully over to the season format over releasing revisions
[0:59:25] <leith_aziz> The one Woolie played?
[0:59:29] <@Menitta> Ye that's it. couldn't think of the name
[0:59:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[0:59:31] <Saltmeisterr> @Menitta i think woolie playedthat
[0:59:34] <@Menitta> Hellish Quart
[0:59:36] <%badguy8312> @dsd24 the HEMA one?
[0:59:40] <DSD24> That game was pretty cool!
[0:59:55] <+TopTieramisu> hellish quart is hype af from what i've seen
[0:59:56] <+NMancy6> just got stuck dealing with Slayer and Johnny all the time lol
[1:00:02] <@Menitta> That's the only indie 3D fighter I can think if
[1:00:16] <+TopTieramisu> i'd be so down to see Hellish Quart tournaments
[1:00:20] <%mighty_max_t> @leith_aziz Basically, he was saying how a lot of indie FGs are like "this is Smash but with X" or "we're like Mk but with X" and he was just curious to see where the idea of Fighting Game can be pushed
[1:00:29] <@Menitta> surprised there's no powerstone inspired fighter
[1:00:32] <DSD24> I've always been into 3D fighters over 2D ever since I played Virtua Fighter 2
[1:00:33] <Zephyr1989> good gamers eh?
[1:00:39] <%badguy8312> @menitta at least until Dong Dong EX hits the digital shelves
[1:01:13] <%badguy8312> stroke that thigh Daiskue
[1:01:38] <%badguy8312> alright y'all, have a good one, back to work now
[1:01:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:41] <Saltmeisterr> @Menitta there is
[1:01:46] <Asuterisuku> That parry though
[1:01:47] <leith_aziz> Im not into much fighting games besides GG I've found. I did spend a good time with T7 and used to be a die hard NRS fan (but oh boy, not anymore for many reasons)
[1:01:48] <DSD24> @badguy8312 Have a good day at work!
[1:01:54] <Saltmeisterr> i pretty sure woolie played it
[1:02:00] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @DSD24 shame VF is dead
[1:02:01] <leith_aziz> I find GG clicks the most boxes for me in terms of what I love
[1:02:06] <%polothegreatest> doodShake
[1:02:06] <Saltmeisterr> the one with yooka laylee in it
[1:02:16] <@Menitta> huh. I don't remember that
[1:02:20] <+TopTieramisu> no fighting game company matches arcsys' aesthetics
[1:02:21] <DSD24> @Reverend_Roscoe If only Final Showdown had Rollback
[1:02:35] <karismaticprik> Woolie.
[1:02:36] <%Lunalios> that was a hype round
[1:02:48] <randomdude365> Hold back fory
[1:02:53] <randomdude365> Forever
[1:02:55] <+TopTieramisu> a darkstalker made by arcsys would be amazing but will never happen
[1:02:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @DSD24 FR.  I was so excited for it, too
[1:02:59] <+TopTieramisu> darkstalkers*
[1:03:12] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @TopTieramisu don't do this to me
[1:03:17] <Saltmeisterr> @Menitta Mighty Fight Federation
[1:03:24] <Saltmeisterr> thats the game's name
[1:03:29] <leith_aziz> I remember getting introduced to GG through Rate the IKs. Bought Rev 2, played the toturial, loved Episode mode and unlocking stuff from the gallery, and the rest was history cohhL
[1:03:47] <%polothegreatest> Darkstalkers isnt dead guys woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:04:04] <+TopTieramisu> darkstalkers will get a sequel. right after fez 2
[1:04:08] <+TopTieramisu> :)
[1:04:17] <Saltmeisterr> speaking of fight games
[1:04:19] <slipdog> I always thought of GG players as Nick Swardson's character from Grandmas Boy since he had the poster on his wall
[1:04:27] <leith_aziz> @polothegreatest please give me som of that copium cohh3
[1:04:33] <+SneakyBeaver102> Daaaaaamn
[1:04:36] <+nial_evol> stay woke in february
[1:04:39] <Saltmeisterr> im been super getting into Rivals of Aether recently
[1:04:43] <Asuterisuku> Reggie kicking butt today.
[1:04:48] <Saltmeisterr> its been really gun
[1:04:48] <%badguy8312> we gonna see F Zero 3 before a new darkstalkers lol
[1:04:54] <%Lunalios> Darkstalkers? you mean that girl that's an SF 5 costume? Kappa
[1:04:57] <slipdog> @Saltmeisterr sajamStare sajamShoot
[1:04:58] <sukeban_law> yea rivals got rollback now
[1:04:59] <@Menitta> that parry noise gets me every time
[1:05:08] <+TopTieramisu> rivals 2 is looking dope with its 3d graphics
[1:05:09] <Saltmeisterr> @sukeban_law and 4 new characters
[1:05:14] <%polothegreatest> PopCorn HSCheers DoritosChip TakeNRG
[1:05:17] <@Menitta> like hitting someone with a frying pan
[1:05:22] <+TopTieramisu> might actually be the best contender to smash for arena fighters
[1:05:41] <sukeban_law> probably the only contender tbh
[1:05:49] <Saltmeisterr> not sure how i feel about rivals 2 tbh
[1:05:51] <@Menitta> OH YOU CAN DASH AND CONTINUE THE COMBO
[1:05:55] <+TopTieramisu> well yeah. nickelodeon is dead
[1:05:58] <Saltmeisterr> i need to see more of it
[1:05:59] <@Menitta> man I need to lab
[1:06:02] <+TopTieramisu> and i doubt the WB one will last
[1:06:09] <slipdog> dont sleep on that playstation all-stars battle royale
[1:06:16] <slipdog> we still have a strong community Kappa
[1:06:16] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu You say its dead but they just said their adding Shredder?
[1:06:22] <Daxalog> is Strive at the point where if you havent been playing for a while itll be tough?
[1:06:24] <sukeban_law> i guess there is also brawlhalla
[1:06:38] <sukeban_law> or whatever is called
[1:06:40] <Asuterisuku> Every fighting game gets there eventually.
[1:06:50] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu It's Free 2 Play with a lot more polish in comparison. Im interested in seeing if it'll gain traction, even if I might not play it
[1:06:53] <%Shad0wTag> @Daxalog I believe lower level floors are active but it helps if you have a buddy you can warm up with I'd say
[1:06:53] <Saltmeisterr> @TopTieramisu the minute i heard it was designed for doubles i immediately lost interest
[1:06:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Daxalog not really, lots of new people with baiken
[1:06:59] <Arqartur0> Just got back, got some burgers and Sam Adams, what did I miss?
[1:06:59] <Asuterisuku> Oof, Dust caught the backdash
[1:07:05] <Saltmeisterr> team games just frustrate me
[1:07:08] <%polothegreatest> Nick failed in the audio department NotLikeThis
[1:07:17] <leith_aziz> @Daxalog Baiken just came out and the playerbase QUADRUPLED, so I'd say no
[1:07:22] <+SneakyBeaver102> Ohhhh!
[1:07:29] <%Shad0wTag> @Arqartur0 The MU is tough for Woolz
[1:07:33] <BlackermanZX> the power of DLC boobs
[1:07:37] <Saltmeisterr> but hopefully rivals 2 is good
[1:07:38] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i don't want to be a doomer, but shredder isn't gonna help it compete against smash. calling it dead might be an exaggeration but i don't think it's a contender
[1:07:47] <Saltmeisterr> i hope is has my snek at launch
[1:07:53] <Saltmeisterr> or at least as early dlc
[1:07:58] <Arqartur0> @Shad0wTag I just saw, damn the game is rough!
[1:08:10] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Nothing can exactly compete with Smash, so that's already a losing battle, no?
[1:08:10] <@Menitta> if Nickelodeon publishes a game, it's guaranteed to have pennies for a budget
[1:08:21] <@Menitta> without fail
[1:08:30] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu I don't think it was ever aiming to topple Smash but just take a very small piece of the pie
[1:08:32] <slipdog> Nintendo is kinda gonna be in its own lane
[1:08:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:08:40] <%polothegreatest> If. Smash had rolllback there will be no contender
[1:08:49] <BlackermanZX> sadly the nicktoons game was doomed from the start because of the lack of voices
[1:08:53] <sukeban_law> if only smash had good online romollaSadge
[1:08:56] <anAngryHamster> @saltmeisterr It's gonna be hard to transition to Rivals 2 when there's a Smash Ultimate's worth of high quality characters on the steam workshop
[1:09:02] <Asuterisuku> Woolie tempted by the Royal Guard
[1:09:12] <%polothegreatest> yea nick needs moar money doodNuts
[1:09:15] <Asuterisuku> Anything that isn't a throw or projectile.
[1:09:16] <%Shad0wTag> In a weird way Smash having no rollback increases the playerbase for other games that do have it
[1:09:20] <@Menitta> If Smash had Vergil clearly it'd be no competition
[1:09:25] <leith_aziz> Oh shit, no wonder I like the parry. ROYAL GUARD! doodOK
[1:09:26] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu the thing, is it had a lot of hype at first but it has completely bled so much of its hype because of lack of features. i don't think it's gonna turn things around at this point
[1:09:39] <Saltmeisterr> @anAngryHamster i think there will def be a split in playbase between rivals 1 and 2
[1:09:43] <Saltmeisterr> also
[1:09:45] <Saltmeisterr> ngl
[1:09:58] <LorcaNomad> @anAngryHamster wh- they're making a RoA 2? Why would they do that when the first game just got rollback + 4 NEW CHARACTERS!?
[1:09:58] <BlackermanZX> GUN
[1:10:06] <Asuterisuku> Air Tatami doesn't feel as good a defensive tool as it was in Xrd.
[1:10:21] <Saltmeisterr> even if ult had rollback i still wouldn't play it
[1:10:29] <Saltmeisterr> that game sucks for me
[1:10:34] <%Shad0wTag> @Asuterisuku I think thats because in Strive its better as an offensive tool?
[1:10:44] <Saltmeisterr> @anAngryHamster to make a game not using game maker lol
[1:10:52] <grouchio> Has Woolie talked about Little V's video and how our subreddit is the worst?
[1:10:55] <BlackermanZX> theres some nasty tatami mixups
[1:10:55] <leith_aziz> The Dynamic camera around throws is a nice touch. Helps the momentum
[1:11:06] <LorcaNomad> @grouchio that was pre-stream yeah
[1:11:08] <Saltmeisterr> game maker is the main reason why rollback for rivals took too long
[1:11:09] <%Shad0wTag> @grouchio Was address at the beginning of the stream
[1:11:15] <grouchio> Clip?
[1:11:16] <+TopTieramisu> it is funny how badly smash ultimate crushes all fighting games in terms of sales despite it being abysmal to play
[1:11:20] <DSD24> Good camerawork is important
[1:11:23] <+TopTieramisu> online
[1:11:33] <%polothegreatest> Sad doodSad
[1:11:41] <sukeban_law> that's the power of a crossover roster
[1:11:41] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu It's Video Games IP: The Game. Netcode be damned sadly
[1:11:46] <Vaunno> Sadge
[1:11:51] <Saltmeisterr> also as much as i hate it, most people do care for 2 pixel graphics
[1:11:54] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu yep. the fortnite before fortnite
[1:12:10] <Saltmeisterr> so it makes sense to transition to 3d for the dev team
[1:12:13] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu Why is it abysmal to play Quite a lot of people enjoy the game even in a no casual sense.
[1:12:20] <Asuterisuku> 6H into Tether would've been so cool...
[1:12:23] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu netcode
[1:12:26] <Vaunno> @shad0wtag online, they said
[1:12:28] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Delay Based netode. And soem of teh worst
[1:12:34] <leith_aziz> *netcode
[1:12:38] <Saltmeisterr> i just hope the visuals are nice
[1:12:40] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu ah my b
[1:13:00] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu Never forget racist/blitz netcode
[1:13:04] <leith_aziz> pickyVibing
[1:13:10] <%polothegreatest> Online smash is bad, but local is fun doodOK
[1:13:11] <@Menitta> I need to figure out how to confirm into 2H and Super
[1:13:17] <@Menitta> with Millia
[1:13:22] <Saltmeisterr> also @LorcaNomad, the 4 new characters were bonus additions to the game
[1:13:25] <+TopTieramisu> blitzing into obscurity!
[1:13:43] <Asuterisuku> @Saltmeisterr Mods made DLC.
[1:13:43] <@Menitta> OOOOH
[1:13:48] <Saltmeisterr> they were workshop characters that were retrofitted into the base roster
[1:13:56] <@Menitta> that's a goooood mixup from fast fall
[1:13:58] <Vaunno> @shad0wtag now known as Rollback 2.0, or Riot netcode :)
[1:13:59] <leith_aziz> That's weird. ARCREVO is suppoused to be today, but I dont see it live. Allthough Kizzie is suppousedly already competing
[1:14:10] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr free dlc in this case
[1:14:22] <Arqartur0> FFS, Millia is a Beast
[1:14:35] <Saltmeisterr> also i heard the creators were fairly compensated for their work
[1:14:47] <%Shad0wTag> @Vaunno Correct me but I swear Riots Rollback 2.0 wasn't the same as Blitz netcode?
[1:14:47] <Saltmeisterr> hell one of them is on the dev team now
[1:14:58] <Arqartur0> HELL YEAH
[1:15:00] <sukeban_law> arcrevo is at 5 pm pst
[1:15:14] <+TopTieramisu> damn, starting at 5 pm?
[1:15:16] <leith_aziz> @Vaunno Blitz Netcode is VF5's version of rollback
[1:15:37] <Vaunno> @shad0wtag it's a similar idea, but I'm mostly meming
[1:15:39] <leith_aziz> In CET, please
[1:15:56] <@Menitta> ok counterhit c.5S into 2H
[1:15:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:16:03] <@Menitta> that can confirm into super
[1:16:11] <%Shad0wTag> @Vaunno Ah my b, I wasn't catching on it was a joke. The explanation for Project L's netcode honestly sounds good on paper
[1:16:14] <%Javaa01> @leith_aziz Check smash gg
[1:16:25] <sukeban_law> 11pm cet
[1:16:38] <leith_aziz> Thank You pickyEZ

[1:17:41] <Vaunno> @shad0wtag oh absolutely, and im pretty sure riots infrastructure is proven solid already for their other games

[1:18:30] <Saltmeisterr> thats a fucked up monke
[1:18:34] <sukeban_law> i wrote est instead of pst on google
[1:19:03] <%Shad0wTag> @Vaunno Personally I just want the feature that was in SF4 where I could just restrict my searches to people within my country/region so I can not get matched up with people from half way around the planet and get 3 million ping but I hope Riot can keep their word
[1:19:16] <Saltmeisterr> thats all

[1:25:05] <+TopTieramisu> yooooooo
[1:25:06] <%kyh9> Oh, nvm
[1:25:57] <Asuterisuku> Arizona 4D
[1:26:44] <sukeban_law> the parry romollaZamn
[1:28:12] <Asuterisuku> He went for it LUL
[1:28:50] <Asuterisuku> Making Millia respect neutral is something I've always had trouble with.
[1:29:49] <%SirGO0SE> why my grandma turn 80 today, i wanna strive jmikeSadbungle
[1:30:50] <Asuterisuku> Will 6K hit in situations that 6H is a little too short to reach?
[1:31:22] <Asuterisuku> I know the reward isn't as good but a Tatami launch is a Tatami launch.
[1:32:20] <%SirGO0SE> the mod that puts jiyuna's face on baikens super is so good
[1:32:43] <%SirGO0SE> jiyuCalvo
[1:34:11] <ZippyPsycho> The best mod is the one that gives her abs majinoBuss
[1:34:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:34:21] <%SirGO0SE> @ZippyPsycho fr tho
[1:34:49] <sukeban_law> @ZippyPsycho romollaBlessed
[1:36:50] <CommandantKobold> @ZippyPsycho Shouldn't have to be a mod smh
[1:38:09] <Asuterisuku> I think Reggie's friend telling him to stick with Baiken over Millia is on something.
[1:38:22] <Asuterisuku> His Millia's sick.
[1:38:23] <%SirGO0SE> i hope they play online again next week, gonna have to catch the vod on this one. gl gang dont get parried
[1:38:35] <%LastHazzerd> that looked so slick
[1:38:40] <%mr_sups> Music picked up real nice there
[1:39:17] <+capybruhArt> love break a spell
[1:39:28] <%kinetikpaws> nice patience
[1:39:31] <0cash> watch that risk
[1:40:35] <+KBGuilty> Damn Reggie
[1:41:40] <wobbllob> reggie played johnny in +R and xrd right?
[1:42:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that pink really does look nice on Millia, especially in this lighting
[1:42:09] <%Heefnoff> How’re the matches going?
[1:42:25] <0cash> matchup fatigue setting in
[1:42:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:42:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie's Millia is oppressing Woolie
[1:42:53] <0cash> it always happens to me. Cant get too many matches without starting to drop combos
[1:43:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @0cash at one point your hands just get kinda tired yeah
[1:43:40] <%jepupu> Is Youzansen too slow to use as an antiair?
[1:43:52] <Asuterisuku> @jepupu It sure isn't.
[1:43:57] <%Heefnoff> Not necessarily, but 6P is just better universally @jepupu
[1:44:26] <0cash> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ yeah and reactions get slow. Specially if you're on the loosing side
[1:44:36] <Asuterisuku> Not always. Yozansen's reach is better and it catches cross-ups more easily.
[1:44:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @0cash yeep
[1:45:02] <%jepupu> Character 6Ps vary so much for how useful they are. Guess Baiken has a decent one then
[1:45:07] <0cash> what a read, damn
[1:45:22] <%jepupu> Burp baste
[1:45:38] <%Irridium> @jepupu I mean it's alright but without roman cancel most you can usually get is combo-ing into the chain. If you're lucky you can get the mat but they gotta be close for it
[1:45:43] <%Heefnoff> Oh, might be worth it for Woolz to try UMVC3 mods again soon. DMC5 Vergil beta got released
[1:45:48] <MidnightPacif1c> LUL
[1:45:48] <%Heefnoff> He’s just amazing
[1:45:54] <MementoAnxius> did woolie try bloodborne psx?
[1:46:02] <wobbllob> yes
[1:46:06] <Asuterisuku> @MementoAnxius He streamed it, it's on the channel now.
[1:46:10] <%Javaa01> @MementoAnxius Yeah BBPSX was earlier this week
[1:46:12] <MementoAnxius> cool
[1:46:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @MementoAnxius they did a full session, they'l complete it next week
[1:48:10] <0cash> the corner dash cancel into grab is so opressive
[1:48:14] <Asuterisuku> Playing in the park or tower you get so many people who RC for the express purpose of baiting burst.
[1:48:47] <%townzzzzz> somethings never change
[1:49:08] <0cash> nice
[1:49:13] <LorcaNomad> PARRYYYYY
[1:49:13] <%kinetikpaws> nice
[1:49:24] <+theoldone001> This makes me wanna plug my fight stick in and play something, but have no new games and keeping up with fighting games can get expensive lol
[1:49:29] <Asuterisuku> Woolie proving once again to be a member of the Royal Guard.
[1:49:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:49:54] <@Menitta> to quote my friend last night, "WHO BLOCKS AFTER RC INTO TANDEM TOP"
[1:49:59] <Ides42> so i just got strive last week and it's my first fighting game. where is best to get info on all the lingo and tips for learning?

[1:50:38] <@Menitta> an extensive wiki on lingo and information
[1:50:45] <0cash> search for fighting game glossary too
[1:50:45] <+pupil31> The Fighting Game Glossary
[1:50:47] <@Menitta> oh that one too
[1:51:09] <LorcaNomad> also if you have a numpad on your keyboard that'll make it easier to learn input lingo faster
[1:51:40] <Asuterisuku> 6 is always forward, 4 is always back, work from there.
[1:52:31] <Ides42> ah so thats what they meant by 6p and such
[1:52:50] <quintenkiwi> Did Reggie get a haircut?
[1:53:25] <Asuterisuku> Strive only has one kind of command normal, too.
[1:53:25] <0cash> yes. 6p is an universal "invicible" move and anti-aerial attack in this game
[1:53:42] <Asuterisuku> It also only has one proximity normal for each character.
[1:53:55] <%kinetikpaws> good air throw reads
[1:54:04] <%Javaa01> @Ides42 Yeah numpad notation is kind of the standard because it's language agnostic, so you never need to worry about translation
[1:54:18] <0cash> two walls, fuck
[1:54:21] <sirstriker0> Yeah so each key is where each direction is on the keypad
[1:54:30] <Asuterisuku> I wish Tekken would switch to numpad.
[1:54:47] <Asuterisuku> But then you'd have to use LP/RP/LK/RK which is NOT language agnostic.
[1:54:59] <%townzzzzz> but than how would I know with arm am I using
[1:55:08] <quintenkiwi> PogChamp
[1:55:20] <sirstriker0> There are even arrows on most numpads for the cardinal directions
[1:55:34] <Asuterisuku> A lot of keyboards don't have numpads anymore though.
[1:56:01] <%OrangeMDT> Reggie was out of his mind right there
[1:56:30] <sirstriker0> Sure, but I'm not buying one without one: it's so much faster to type numbers with it
[1:56:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[1:56:47] <%Javaa01> @Asuterisuku Yeah that's kind of an enthusiast thing that made it's way into the mainstream, though still, most everyday keyboards are still full size

[2:04:35] <Murdercles> i guess it's tough to go from nagoriyuki to anything else
[2:04:48] <%jepupu> Millia is so much manageable for characters that have a decent DP
[2:05:01] <+CryptusMaximus> Unfortunately I feel like Milia lives where Baiken can't effectively deal with, the air.

[2:10:53] <+cubbywolf> nice
[2:11:04] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus there are only 12 of us you could do bo3

[2:11:37] <Bl4kDynamite> moon got scared of his own bomb
[2:11:39] <+cubbywolf> the Faust army comes from the trumpet iirc
[2:11:50] <whyfirehot> whos got the controls at the moment
[2:11:56] <+cubbywolf> so anyone can get it
[2:11:59] <%Heefnoff> That’s on me for my shit crashing, shouldn’t have been running Crysis zyzxOfaGod
[2:12:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @whyfirehot Wool
[2:12:04] <whyfirehot> *controller
[2:12:15] <whyfirehot> ah nice thanks
[2:12:48] <sirstriker0> I'm still saying a queue system would make this ten times better
[2:12:59] <%townzzzzz> whole lot people here now
[2:13:10] <@Menitta> The player match lobbies have a queue system and spectating
[2:13:17] <@Menitta> but it's still kinda jank
[2:13:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kyle????
[2:13:33] <%Shad0wTag> I mean I feel like this works just fine?
[2:13:33] <@Menitta> John Guilty
[2:13:34] <MidnightPacif1c> coxJam
[2:13:37] <stormhawk9891> BIRTHDAY TRAIN
[2:13:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> birthday train PogChamp
[2:13:41] <@Menitta> yeah this works
[2:13:49] <SpookyBeef7> Everything about the lobby system in this game is jank, and I highly doubt they're ever going to actually fix anything about them.
[2:14:05] <%Heefnoff> It’s serviceable, just wish they stuck to the Xrd/Granblue lobbies
[2:14:29] <sirstriker0> @menitta Oh I'm talking about a queue bot like in Sajam's stream and some chess players streams that'd go in the chat
[2:14:33] <%Irridium> @SpookyBeef7 doubtful considering it's tied into the points system which you use to fish for avatar items to display in said lobbies
[2:14:36] <0cash> yeah, the 2d doesnt work at all for lobbies
[2:14:41] <@Menitta> Oh huh. that's cool
[2:14:45] <%Heefnoff> Yeah, using a queue in stream is good
[2:14:45] <%Shad0wTag> @heefnoff Someone in the design team just loves this specific gimmick and style and seemingly will not budge on this
[2:14:59] <%Heefnoff> I wonder if any of the choices were budget related
[2:15:01] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[2:15:05] <%Heefnoff> Or like, due to feedback from dbfz
[2:15:06] <Ai_VS> 2d works they just didnt implement it right lol
[2:15:19] <@Menitta> im just thinking back to the betas where you couldn't even see the stations
[2:15:21] <%Javaa01> @Heefnoff Probably DBFZ feedback
[2:15:23] <%Heefnoff> Cause they’ve been using that style for like 3-4 games now, maybe they thought we didn’t like the old style
[2:15:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> No respect for Ky
[2:15:30] <Ai_VS> they should've gone with what TFH did
[2:15:30] <0cash> for lobbies? seems like 3d would always be clearer
[2:15:31] <%Heefnoff> Yeah that beta was whack @menitta
[2:15:33] <Pookiedaexzile> You know what works best? A fucking menu
[2:15:34] <%Shad0wTag> @sirstriker0 If you really want Woolie to see this idea why not tweet it to him or DM him on here about it if you feel it will improve things?
[2:15:38] <%Heefnoff> Would make sense @javaa01
[2:15:39] <%Javaa01> Cause as far as the 3D lobby went, DBFZ was by far the worst style of iteration
[2:15:41] <%townzzzzz> remember when there were no stations in the beta
[2:15:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta god that beta was wild
[2:16:01] <%Heefnoff> Beta Potemkin was a monster lol
[2:16:04] <@Menitta> it was simultaneously the best and worst beta lol
[2:16:10] <sirstriker0> @shad0wtag I can do that? Alright I'll try later if that's ok
[2:16:25] <%Shad0wTag> Time will tell if DNF will be worse
[2:16:32] <%Heefnoff> Oooo Happy Chaos gaming
[2:16:35] <sirstriker0> @menitta Those were wild times
[2:16:36] <@Menitta> time to kill chaos
[2:16:37] <%Heefnoff> I thought it was just gonna be me
[2:16:39] <%Irridium> heavenly chaos' are infuriating
[2:16:45] <Admiral_PopnFresh> come on get happy
[2:16:53] <+CryptusMaximus> HC is the first character in this game I want to go fuck himself lmao
[2:17:06] <%Heefnoff> I gotta watch Deb more for the knowledge
[2:17:12] <+pupil31> CHAOS
[2:17:16] <+CryptusMaximus> Like he could be deleted and I would shed no tears
[2:17:16] <%Heefnoff> I’m still lacking a lot of the competitive strats with him
[2:17:19] <kikoeru_san> Deb's hands are insane, that cow empress makes Chaos look easy
[2:17:22] <%polothegreatest> woolieEVIL did someone said kill chaos? woolieSPICE
[2:17:22] <Arqartur0> It's always a treat to see Happy Chaos in a match
[2:17:28] <%townzzzzz> bang bang
[2:17:29] <%Shad0wTag> @sirstriker0 I mean if you feel that legit will help why not just tell him? Easier than you hoping he reads it here
[2:17:38] <Ai_VS> looks like this guy is new to chaos
[2:17:50] <+Demoli_PT> oh this is Xrd's chipp theme
[2:17:55] <sirstriker0> @shad0wtag Makes sense to me
[2:17:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:17:59] <Vaunno> yesiiirrr
[2:18:02] <%kinetikpaws> oh just noticed the retical change
[2:18:06] <0cash> are tower levels character specific or general?
[2:18:11] <+Demoli_PT> general
[2:18:13] <sirstriker0> !twitter

[2:18:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I disagree, Regg, he's not swag
[2:18:50] <Vaunno> general, characters have their own playtime lvl separate from tower rank
[2:18:53] <%kinetikpaws> i love happy chaos so much wish my brain could work using him
[2:18:55] <%Shad0wTag> @sirstriker0 The only reason it hasn't changed is because most of us haven't had a problem
[2:19:10] <someduden> damn got my hopes up but didn't realise crossplay isn't implemented yet
[2:19:11] <%Heefnoff> Happy Chaos is sick

[2:28:56] <Dakuu75> @Th3SmartAlec a battle till the end of time
[2:29:06] <%Shad0wTag> @0cash Wait till you get the 400 ping ps4 wifi warrior then you will hear lyrics lytGROSS
[2:29:11] <Boogagoob> Baiken is so much fun to watch, and I’ve been having fun playing her - I just wish I knew what to do out of tether 😭
[2:29:22] <%Irridium> @0cash it does if they're on a 10 year old laptop and load for a solid 2 minutes
[2:29:36] <+CryptusMaximus> 6H is my go to filler move now for most combos. it hits SO HARD and combos well into Kabari in most situations
[2:29:37] <+MoaLaMoa> MoaLaMoa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! woolieEVIL
[2:29:53] <0cash> @Shad0wTag @Irridium damn, rough. I guess i lucked out
[2:30:09] <Bl4kDynamite> He dropped the combo there at the end
[2:30:35] <0cash> a ram, LESGO
[2:30:36] <%Shad0wTag> @bin_vv Good luck!
[2:31:15] <MidnightPacif1c> bigger sword
[2:31:17] <Boogagoob> Oh jeeze that’s the highest level I’ve seen
[2:31:25] <+CryptusMaximus> This game having weight differences infuriates me so much lol
[2:31:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Dakuu75 But wait, here comes a new challenger: THIGHS
[2:31:31] <Boogagoob> Didn’t know it went past triple digits
[2:31:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man I kinda wanna play Ram now that she's good but I don't wanna get carried by the character NotLikeThis csbeastSetIn NotLikeThis
[2:31:59] <SaiyanShoto> When it’s character specific I never bother learning it, I just go by whatever my reaction or instinct is in the match LUL
[2:32:00] <Afrosamasenpai> SWEET JESUS
[2:32:01] <yukichocomilk> as a ram player its either fS ou 2S LUL
[2:32:03] <velgaduere> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ do fun. game fun

[2:32:04] <kikoeru_san> YO WHAT THE FUCK

[2:32:15] <+TheScorpionEater> @Th3SmartAlec Baiken thighs vs Ram thighs a battle for the ages LUL
[2:32:16] <%Shad0wTag> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Hey if you have fun it doesn't matter
[2:32:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @velgaduere but muh gobliiinssss csbeastSetIn
[2:32:22] <@Menitta> Your life bar is deleted.
[2:32:33] <+CryptusMaximus> If Ram corners me I just assume it's a good time to go make a sandwich.
[2:32:36] <velgaduere> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ your goblins are explicitly anti-you. kill them by forcing yourself to have fun
[2:32:38] <%townzzzzz> run away
[2:32:49] <%MelBrooksKA> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Pick a top tier woolieSMUG
[2:32:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[2:33:04] <@Menitta> i wish there was a way to fight while in the line
[2:33:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> doggo
[2:33:13] <%Shad0wTag> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Just play the cute girl and have fun brother
[2:33:18] <+seiyaofabyss> That super is invul frame 1 man
[2:33:27] <%Bin_VV> GGs Reggie
[2:33:32] <+seiyaofabyss> the nuttiest dumbest thing ever hahaha
[2:33:43] <%Shad0wTag> @menitta Are there any recent games where you can fight while waiting in a queue like this outta curiosity?
[2:33:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Shad0wTag guess I can try it at some point but mmmm
[2:33:48] <marcomatame> I love Strive but some characters are more funny than they are fun
[2:33:50] <Ai_VS> gio cant safe jump coz you got parry
[2:33:52] <+seiyaofabyss> its range is also bigger than you assume
[2:34:04] <@Menitta> there's Skullgirls where everyone is fighting all the time
[2:34:15] <%kinetikpaws> i wonder how many times i'll be parried as Leo LUL
[2:34:16] <%Shad0wTag> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Worst case scenario you like her best case you don't
[2:34:16] <sukeban_law> yooooo intro time
[2:34:24] <Boogagoob> @kosorsomesaykosm_  ram is ridiculous but so are most characters in the game, don’t let a character being strong or easy discourage you. (Signed a Gio player)
[2:34:28] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[2:34:30] <%Juriasu> one braincell
[2:34:38] <someduden> they should add a smash like system for the music so you can set the songs you like to random
[2:34:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Shad0wTag yeah that's true
[2:35:03] <Ai_VS> calli burst!
[2:35:14] <%Juriasu> YO
[2:35:17] <%Shad0wTag> @someduden You can set music to random it just doesn't refresh after rematches
[2:35:18] <marcomatame> i honestly always start the first round with 5S using Baiken, it's just funny
[2:35:20] <+Demoli_PT> sick ass combo
[2:35:22] <Vaunno> SHEEESH
[2:36:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Boogagoob yeah, right now I play Millia while waiting for Jam and that's fine, but yeah gotta de goblin myself a bit
[2:36:08] <someduden> @shad0wtag I mean set certain ones to the list of random, so you don't get certain songs
[2:36:24] <%townzzzzz> you mean a playlist
[2:36:31] <someduden> yea
[2:36:32] <+TheScorpionEater> @marcomatame the only character I've seen consistently beat it is Ky LUL
[2:36:56] <Vaunno> smash random music frequency would be nice too
[2:37:11] <marcomatame> @TheScorpionEater i should know, im a Kyle main
[2:37:40] <someduden> would love to have the Verity of music but when you get a credits song it makes the match seem so slow
[2:37:55] <sukeban_law> the choice of having baiken's theme have a 30 second start up leaves me dumbfounded, especially in a fast game like strive
[2:38:39] <Boogagoob> Honestly one of my favorite things about this game (my first GG for what it’s worth) is that it feels like almost every character is the bane of *someone’s* existence
[2:39:11] <%Shad0wTag> @boogagoob Aye every character has something to them to make people seethe

[2:45:07] <velgaduere> @Shad0wTag that's my point, it's the same dude giving wildly nonsense lyrics on one song and then perfectly-written lyrics on another to the same exact vocalist LUL
[2:45:17] <marcomatame> So chat what characters do you play? I like my white bread boy Ky, he fun. Axl, JackO, and Baiken are super fun secondaries tho.

[2:52:47] <%townzzzzz> yea

[2:52:50] <Vaunno> oh noo, not the funny meme quote monsoon lmao
[2:52:56] <+CryptusMaximus> Woolie should give the English dub a run some more. I actually prefer some characters VAs (Not Baikens though unfortunately)
[2:53:02] <%kinetikpaws> more gorilla time
[2:53:03] <velgaduere> @Vaunno oh YES
[2:53:11] <+Demoli_PT> 17 total, we can do bo3 tho i dont mind the wait personally
[2:53:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @CryptusMaximus hope they let us pick sub or dub by character someday

[2:53:31] <%Shad0wTag> !uptime
[2:53:32] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 4 minutes
[2:53:34] <marcomatame> its unreal
[2:53:39] <Arqartur0> @kinetikpaws It gives strong "Barrett and Cloud kicking the door" vibes
[2:53:42] <+Demoli_PT> yeah not a fan of leo either personally
[2:53:46] <%Shad0wTag> We probably got another few hours
[2:53:53] <+Superbro64> We got leo haters in chat?
[2:53:55] <+Ricky_Rexx> alright chat. real talk. BEST THEME in strive?
[2:53:58] <Invess> are Leo players technically using ultra instinct
[2:54:00] <%kinetikpaws> he has every tool and a lot of +on block
[2:54:01] <marcomatame> @Superbro64 aye
[2:54:03] <+CryptusMaximus> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Agreed. SFV does it already. I'd love to keep Baiken in JP but have I-No for example as English....for...reasons.
[2:54:05] <%Shad0wTag> I have never met anyone who saw Leo amd thought damn I love him
[2:54:12] <%elderpunch> @Ricky_Rexx Crawl or iron clad faith
[2:54:14] <+Vimyis> I don't think I've ever fought a leo, there's not enough of 'em
[2:54:19] <Invess> they're body just moves on it's on

[2:54:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @CryptusMaximus yes, reasons csbeastScared
[2:54:46] <Vaunno> @ricky_rexx worst theme is an easier question to answer, and that's still really tough
[2:54:47] <+Superbro64> LUL its all good bro, I hate leo mirrors too, being a main myself
[2:54:49] <sukeban_law> axl theme is my favourite
[2:54:51] <Boogagoob> @ricky_rexx Subhuman self, Requiem, and disaster of passion are probably my favs
[2:54:52] <Arqartur0> Haven't played Strive, is Potemkin still in the game?
[2:54:55] <Vaunno> no
[2:54:58] <LorcaNomad> did anyone get a clip of that parry a few matches ago?
[2:55:01] <Vaunno> he got deleted

[2:55:25] <+Superbro64> pot
[2:55:34] <marcomatame> People think dealing with Pot is annoying but Leo's shmixing and lack of minus frames is somehow better
[2:55:35] <+extradopeness> rip bozo
[2:55:39] <Arqartur0> that is a shame, I loved Potemkin
[2:55:43] <+Superbro64> ohh? is this a real hc player?

[3:23:10] <%Revorger> @marcomatame Oceania #4
[3:23:16] <%WutangchickeN> the best track in this game is the screaming in my head I hear when I get hit with the tenth totsugeki in a row.

[3:25:44] <Pookiedaexzile> You miss every shot you don't take
[3:25:52] <%Javaa01> @Vimyis Vsync increases input lag, so the optimal way to play is to just live with the occasional torn frame
[3:26:02] <MechNexus> drink for every totsugeki

[3:38:39] <velgaduere> @0cash the what
[3:38:53] <0cash> the lobby music
[3:38:56] <Jay444111> And alt tabbing killed the game...
[3:38:57] <velgaduere> ohhh lmao
[3:39:25] <velgaduere> I was legitimately looking for the He's a Pirate in Let Me Carve Your Way for a moment
[3:39:34] <@Menitta> I replaced the lobby music with Baja Mitai
[3:39:37] <0cash> AHAHA
[3:40:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[3:40:24] <%kinetikpaws> the slowdown is so great
[3:40:24] <0cash> oh wow i never thought about modding it. Its because i never use the lobbies. but thanks for the idea
[3:40:54] <%kinetikpaws> we got a god leo
[3:41:00] <+Demoli_PT> man the cabs are FILTHY today
[3:41:01] <+CryptusMaximus> Leo wants his bananas

[3:41:44] <Jay444111> I'll be back most in the line. stupid alt tabbing...
[3:41:50] <bigshedman> Still really confused what the mechanics are behind the stations just not working after a while...
[3:42:01] <+Vimyis> netcode busted
[3:42:10] <velgaduere> @bigshedman just bad matchmaking code
[3:42:25] <+Shotgundam009> I really hope they update the menus in general lol
[3:42:43] <bigshedman> But then it works fine on the next one? I would think that the stations are just ways to connect two people but I guess not...?
[3:42:59] <Bid00fus> woolie pls
[3:43:04] <%kinetikpaws> man be uppercutting a lot
[3:43:06] <+Vimyis> the actual match netcode is great but something about the lobby netocde is just borked
[3:43:11] <velgaduere> @bigshedman you'd think, but it's all tied to the code used in the lobbies
[3:43:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[3:43:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:46:41] <Dakuu75> real-talk... when you're playing games with your friends. If you tell them "you suck", the ideal response is "that's ok"
[3:46:44] <RyuuAoi> @cryptusmaximus Honestly
[3:46:58] <Bid00fus> gg @WoolieVersus !
[3:47:41] <sirstriker0> They've made these DLC tracks bangers

[3:47:57] <Bid00fus> baiken 2h is such a good button
[3:48:07] <velgaduere> I'm still not on board with Jack-O's theme, not my thing
[3:48:42] <sukeban_law> it's still decent but yea not the best compared to other themes in the game
[3:48:51] <sirstriker0> @velgaduere that's like the only one I'm not into come to think of it
[3:48:54] <+meteor530> Chip chippie chipidie chipster chipping away at cha
[3:48:54] <marcomatame> @velgaduere i like it, but her Xrd theme is so much better
[3:49:01] <%JetpackMcQuack> out chip chipp
[3:49:04] <marcomatame> Juno slaps
[3:49:15] <+Demoli_PT> @alteisen you need to do 2S 2H k alpha for optimal shit
[3:49:24] <+Demoli_PT> often you end at 5H which doesnt really lead to anything
[3:49:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I didn't think that kenjyu would hit lol
[3:49:47] <sirstriker0> But 3 out of 4 is still a really good track record
[3:49:59] <Jay444111> And game froze with alt tabbing... again

[4:42:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> good mirror
[4:42:42] <LorcaNomad> @CryptusMaximus has there been any word on them fixing the lobbies or at least improving them at all?
[4:42:45] <someduden> @cryptusmaximus Japan in general really
[4:42:46] <Vaunno> didn't xrd do lobbies just fine? like not amazing, but still functional?
[4:43:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> this is gd sekiro
[4:43:41] <@Menitta> they were fine in Xrd
[4:43:55] <sirstriker0> omg i died
[4:44:05] <+CryptusMaximus> I'm still amazed you can play Ranked games picking and choosing who you want to fight, like hate May? No Problem just never accept a match from one lmao.

[4:44:37] <sirstriker0> GG
[4:44:56] <@Menitta> Strive in a lot of ways reminds me of Titanfall 1. Outside of the game, everything is really half baked. in the game, it's an incredibly polished experience

[4:45:59] <%Shad0wTag> I'm assuming its because you populated a room that wasn't empty made them think its 14 AUS players? @woolieversus

[4:46:03] <+anoldtoilet> hell yeah

[4:46:17] <@Menitta> @lorcanomad Titanfall 2's menus and stuff outside of multiplayer was still there and as polished though.
[4:46:32] <someduden> woulda thought baikens booobers would be censored in Australia
[4:46:53] <Vaunno> knowing AU govt i wouldn't be surprised
[4:47:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> that last little pixel
[4:47:16] <%ekodrop> i think the australians are still salty theyre prisoners in their own country.

[4:57:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> no plan no reads
[4:57:08] <someduden> problem is it seems woolie keeps so much working in his brain that he can't be in the moment of the match, but maybe that's just how he likes to play
[4:57:23] <+CryptusMaximus> @Menitta Ah the ol' Pretend I'm Bad mix-up. They never expect it when I win the 10th game after a 9 match blow up Kappa

[5:14:42] <hendy4> is bikens jump that safe or is he just not antiairing i havent played in about a month
[5:15:01] <+anoldtoilet> its not that baikens that safe its that baiken has generally poor anti airs
[5:15:10] <+anoldtoilet> pretty much just 6p and tatami
[5:15:14] <someduden> baiken has some good tools in the air though
[5:15:16] <+anoldtoilet> and air grab
[5:15:18] <+anoldtoilet> yeah
[5:15:35] <+anoldtoilet> air vs air shes good but ground vs a jumping opponent not much

[5:15:41] <+anoldtoilet> she has some
[5:16:01] <+anoldtoilet> but no like, big anti air attacks the way ky or sol or people with dps or large verticals do
