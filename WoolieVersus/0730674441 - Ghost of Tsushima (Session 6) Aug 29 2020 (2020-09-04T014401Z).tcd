[0:03:51] <CreisiSweg> What about animekisa?
[0:04:18] <%kekkerscrew> I really have to say this. When I was a kid growing up. I'd head to China Town every weekend spending 30 bucks to pick up two 15 dollar VHS of fansubbed anime. Max of 3-4 episodes per tape.
[0:04:25] <CreisiSweg> yeah, a streaming site, kinda recent
[0:04:41] <vVAstrAVv> btw woolie thanks for shilling the boys i binged it all thursday that was good shit
[0:05:14] <%kekkerscrew> If you told me as a Kid I could just spend 15 bucks a month or so for an anime streaming site I'd have told you that you were crazy and sign me up.

[0:07:48] <%kekkerscrew> That's why I don't really see the defense for pirating anime right now. Except in specific circumstances like stuff that is under threat of not existing anymore.
[0:08:32] <masterfire23> why arr we talking about pirating
[0:08:51] <masterfire23> R)
[0:09:24] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Man I remember back in the day connecting to IRC bots to download the Rockman.EXE anime
[0:09:59] <+p4ntless> all I care about convenience, I don't mind paying for streaming services but when it comes to shit that isn't on one of those and my only option is pay out the ass for physical it's time to fire up the VPN

[0:33:21] <RamenRiderZ> "That's a fat wolf!"
[0:33:25] <%doomerskeletor13> You can make the bear go away if you say it’s name backwards
[0:33:43] <Afterman_> hrktos

[0:48:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol they got wrecked by storms twice
[0:48:29] <%DashXero> Loosely inspired by historic events.
[0:48:34] <SomeAsianDood> But every Japanese samurai died on that beach
[0:48:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DOSHO
[0:48:42] <%DashXero> So loose, it would make poor underwear.
[0:48:50] <%alexandrecau> good thing the mongols don'T fight on horses huh
[0:48:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> The story might not be accurate, neither are the events but the premise is true. Mongols did invade
[0:49:23] <%DSD24> Wow that guy did a dash
[0:49:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> Don't fight Lu Bu tho
[0:49:55] <+p4ntless> that tree was a mongol, you did the right thing
[0:49:57] <%DSD24> Come on Woolie that Lu Bu shit was rad
[0:50:15] <%DSD24> Oh I feel you then
[0:50:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT'T'S LU BU
[0:50:31] <danknugglit> Bigger hat = more power
[0:50:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> Function over form, very practical I like that
[0:50:58] <%DashXero> Only powerful necks carry big hats.
[0:51:51] <%DSD24> Oh boy More Ishikawa missions
[0:51:57] <Make_me_mad> Fun fact: Tsushima got wrecked even harder in the second invasion, historically, so no matter how this game ends it's gonna be a bummer for these guys a few years from now.
[0:52:17] <VZLANemesis> i wonder if this game will be playable on ps5?
[0:53:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Make_me_mad all i'm hearing is sequel
[0:53:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:53:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> I also like how the mongols skipped tsushima later on by travelling from was it China I believe?
[0:53:29] <+p4ntless> @VZLANemesis I'd hope so, I'll definitely give it a second playthough if I can do it at 4k/60
[0:53:35] <T_Sasquatch> DDDDuel
[0:53:40] <Dave_VD> Damn looks like they’re only like 1/3 through if that
[0:53:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doesn't sound like he got there
[0:54:17] <T_Sasquatch> Its a mythic quest
[0:54:29] <Make_me_mad> @Reizie_Etherealm They had multiple fleets that invasion. Some of them skipped Tsushima but the korean fleet stopped by and stomped the island into the dirt just for the nostalgia.
[0:54:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> Nostalgia lmao
[0:54:53] <%DensityD> compose a shitty (great) haiku
[0:54:56] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:54:58] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re in set locations
[0:54:58] <Make_me_mad> Cannot be overstated how hard they lost every battle.
[0:55:06] <Afterman_> there is an icon
[0:55:08] <Afterman_> on the map
[0:55:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[0:55:11] <%DashXero> Samurai silhouete
[0:55:14] <+nintendograndpA64> what a nimble ass horse
[0:55:41] <%Sparkseid> There's an Icon on the map, though it's very small
[0:55:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> What's wrong with that horse's legs??
[0:55:48] <%doomerskeletor13> It will be a lone straw hat in a very obvious dueling arena
[0:56:13] <nopgnikatnight> ouch, horse tree
[0:56:18] <T_Sasquatch> It's called six blades of kojiro if you encounter it
[0:56:45] <Make_me_mad> There are so many cool locations in this game where you end up not having fights.
[0:56:50] <nopgnikatnight> N I C E
[0:56:56] <%DSD24> Dagger man
[0:56:57] <+solzan2000> lol
[0:57:01] <Make_me_mad> I wish there was a button to spawn enemies so you could have radical battles wherever you wanted.
[0:57:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:57:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> KNOIFE
[0:57:05] <%DashXero> How were you sleeping?!
[0:57:40] <ralphfromdk> The power of GUN
[0:57:41] <%DashXero> Standoffs are the best, though. Easiest way to kill guys.
[0:57:42] <T_Sasquatch> Game audio really ramped up above your speaking
[0:57:43] <Make_me_mad> By the end of the game I was ignoring standoffs and starting every battle by throwing a bomb into the crowd.
[0:57:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GUN
[0:57:49] <+p4ntless> those patrols get REAL
[0:57:55] <danknugglit> Gun stance
[0:58:14] <+gnoame> Cannon guy was more dangerous to his friends than Jin
[0:58:15] <gamewarden92> handgonne
[0:58:21] <%DashXero> The patrols get real, you just gotta get realer.
[0:58:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> did anyone ever reach the limit for any resource other than bamboo?
[0:58:29] <dellis80> I have a question about an event I do not know if he is past or not. all I'm going to say is that it involves a girl
[0:58:30] <ralphfromdk> Heads up Woolie and co, game audio is a bit louder than you, especially in combat
[0:58:47] <+p4ntless> RUN IT BACK
[0:59:06] <%DSD24> Ooo he was close that time
[0:59:06] <+gnoame> TWO FOR TWO
[0:59:16] <+p4ntless> big boy stance
[0:59:19] <Overloard> i feel like the standoffs get harder later into the game
[0:59:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 0-2
[0:59:26] <ralphfromdk> It's a brute even when he has a boom stick
[0:59:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> Getting GANKED
[0:59:40] <%DSD24> Friendly Fire
[1:00:00] <ralphfromdk> That is correct, stance is for guard damage
[1:00:11] <Overloard> i perfected every standoff on the first chapter but after that my standoff success took a nosedive
[1:00:23] <%DSD24> They aren't Assassins Creeding it
[1:00:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:00:41] <Make_me_mad> Other fun historical fact: This invasion force was actually kind of small because the mongols were still consolidating power. The second invasion happened after they'd settled their own affairs and could really dedicated their forces to the battle.
[1:00:47] <+solzan2000> boo
[1:01:02] <Overloard> the traveler garb in white is absolutely GOAT
[1:01:06] <Make_me_mad> So this game is fighting the weak-ass mongols while the big boys loom on the horizon.
[1:01:17] <%Malik1002> these Mongols have no honor as they slight there throats from the shadow
[1:01:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> RUDE
[1:01:40] <gamewarden92> "Those guys were BAMF."
[1:02:29] <%alexandrecau> look up while playing seeing the sky clear is great
[1:02:30] <jorniev> ah yes... grass
[1:03:03] <dellis80> mmmm, BAMF, my favorite. I love the sound they make when their asses hit the ground LUL
[1:03:11] <%alexandrecau> no it's because you have no homnor
[1:03:12] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie, sorry to intrude but can you check what flute song you have equipped?
[1:03:26] <%alexandrecau> if you use ghost weapon it set storm
[1:03:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dishonor = more storminess
[1:03:35] <%afronooch> did minh ever get his cherry coke?
[1:03:38] <%DSD24> Dagger Man again
[1:03:41] <%DSD24> YEeeee
[1:03:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NICE
[1:03:48] <Make_me_mad> Woolie: "Minh you're wrong actually, let me repeat what you just said back at you"
[1:03:54] <theCoolChild> Is that why i always had storms
[1:04:06] <%rottingpastry> They die eventually
[1:04:14] <StebTheVee> they die
[1:04:38] <%rottingpastry> I have seen one get stuck before.
[1:04:40] <jorniev> like shooting guys in the gut in MGS5
[1:04:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> They do not path like that. They will mush their face into a rock without going anywhere.

[1:12:13] <%DSD24> @Estuko That's pretty cute actually
[1:12:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> So much backstory being established just by having characters talk about the past
[1:12:22] <gamewarden92> I do that too.
[1:12:23] <Make_me_mad> "I stare at the ground because I wanna see what's up"
[1:12:35] <vVAstrAVv> but you cant trip in games so see the sights

[1:13:03] <%DashXero> We need a scientific study on this shit.
[1:13:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Me too Woolie
[1:13:14] <trickquestionz> I do that because I dislike eye contact.
[1:13:18] <vVAstrAVv> minh loves rhidorana i bet lol
[1:13:24] <T_Sasquatch> Weird i don't think i look down while walking , i look ahead and mentally note what's coming
[1:13:25] <%alexandrecau> You'll miss it anyway
[1:13:25] <PirateMike_> My friends yell at me when in CSGO I always look low and end up shooting toes
[1:13:28] <jorniev> ITS NOT REAL... but I do that
[1:13:31] <arkv01> don't look up, game devs don't want you to see their awful skyboxes
[1:13:38] <%SomeSageAdvice> to be fair, Woolie did avoid some bad situations in Dark Souls by looking at the ground
[1:13:58] <PanicSwytch> I used to do that when i was a kid
[1:14:16] <chaos2frozen> the only time I'm looking down while walking is when I'm staring at my phone lol
[1:14:20] <T_Sasquatch> Speaking of which i cannot imagine trying to lp any from soft game

[1:50:44] <RamenRiderZ> "Use your feeble peasant eyes and gaze upon the visage of big money"
[1:50:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I just finished Yakuza 3 the other day
[1:50:53] <Aussie_Manny> And then Yakuza got translated......... when it didn't really need ti.
[1:50:55] <Aussie_Manny> to*
[1:51:00] <%alexandrecau> You're still in a quest now she'll never give you poison
[1:51:06] <SomeAsianDood> Yakuza 3 was the quality dip right? 1,2 were good then 4
[1:51:32] <%doomerskeletor13> 3 is the weakest game in the series but it’s still good
[1:51:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> Divinity Original Sin 2
[1:51:33] <%alexandrecau> 4 was divisive, basically 2 was viewed as the best
[1:51:50] <SomeAsianDood> I started at 4 tbh so
[1:51:55] <RamenRiderZ> Good ol Oblivion npc chatter
[1:52:00] <%alexandrecau> then 0 took the spot and everything else is as long as akiyama is there I won't hate it
[1:52:03] <%doomerskeletor13> @aussie_manny What do you mean it didn’t need to be translated?
[1:52:05] <%SleepyDavid> the witcher 3 has a lot of chatter
[1:52:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the last tier still doesn't change the look does it
[1:52:30] <Idon__> Nope
[1:53:13] <%DashXero> The last tier of Sakai armor makes it look sick!
[1:53:34] <Aussie_Manny> @doomerskeletor13 Strictly and personally speaking, I'm okay with stories set in non-English countries not bothering with dialogue translations. Subs are fine. For me.
[1:53:35] <%rottingpastry> I wish the last tier didn't have antlers
[1:53:41] <jorniev> "your eyes look like my kittie" is banter line that I like
[1:54:02] <%alexandrecau> soulja
[1:54:10] <%rottingpastry> Dressup is important
[1:54:18] <%doomerskeletor13> @aussie_manny ...Yakuza is subtitled? That’s what they’re translating
[1:54:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Still hasn't seen the 3rd level yet has he?
[1:54:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the dressup is half the fun
[1:54:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Reizie_Etherealm nope
[1:54:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Unless you’re talking about the dub 1 one had
[1:54:58] <Make_me_mad> I used the Oni's Blade Straw Hat for basically the entire game.

[1:55:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> Didn't the white dye merchant sells you one clean white headband?
[1:55:19] <gamewarden92> Fashion of Tsushima
[1:55:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I liked the 2nd son headband with this armor
[1:55:45] <%alexandrecau> a game let you fast travel mid quest feels so generous

[2:17:49] <+BottledLineArt> In america you get money for plasma.
[2:17:50] <%koolaid_kevster> yes you get paid for blood in usa
[2:17:53] <%rottingpastry> You can donate blood and plasma for money
[2:17:54] <Aussie_Manny> Money? That's nuts.
[2:17:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea but idk the details
[2:17:56] <EVOriginal> Blood and plasma
[2:17:58] <Huntercd> We pay for blood and plasma
[2:17:58] <+arancet> sometimes, often not, maybe a movie ticket
[2:18:01] <%huskarl_zap> it depends if the supply is low

[2:18:18] <Aussie_Manny> In Australia, for blood donating, we get a milkshake, and that's it.
[2:18:18] <%alexandrecau> It's America you want shit you pay
[2:18:19] <%Irridium> do they still not let gay/bi people give blood?
[2:18:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> at schools i don't think you'd get paid
[2:18:25] <%CptnCampy61> We gotta pay to get it too that’s the catch

[2:19:30] <Aussie_Manny> Your body will replace the blood volume (plasma) within 48 hours. It will take four to eight weeks for your body to completely replace the red blood cells you donated.
[2:19:37] <%rottingpastry> Do it.
[2:19:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pause time and eat 50 cheese wheels to regenerate all your blood.

[2:48:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> AND a nemesis who was terrified of the gravewalker, so he would show up, become instantly terrified and run away from me lol
[2:48:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> For Silmarillion nerds, apparently the whole wraith thing making the protag immortal is a huge violation of the will of Eru Iluvatar. Like it should be impossible for a man to be immortal.
[2:49:00] <%DensityD> your haiku makes me so horny, my lord
[2:49:03] <%heartlesshealer> unmoving mountains seems out of place, but sure
[2:49:27] <%DensityD> @fruit_pie_the_magician LUL
[2:49:42] <%alexandrecau> he is not immortal, the elf ghost is
[2:49:43] <medril07> lady yuriko, also known as suck machine back in the day
[2:49:43] <ralphfromdk> GeneralSCPatton He is not immortal, he's possesed by a ghost. No ghost, his body goes back to being dead
[2:50:18] <%rottingpastry> Do the second one!
[2:50:19] <ralphfromdk> Meh, this is the last part, it's nice and short
[2:50:20] <%rottingpastry> Pleeease
[2:50:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I LOVE THIS CHARM
[2:50:30] <medril07> time for a duel
[2:50:31] <jorniev> @generalscpatton technically he is just not dying, right up until ghosts left him, unless that is the thing that it's not allowed
[2:50:32] <%DensityD> The escort mission in my pants is also quite long
[2:50:37] <Afterman_> this is the best quest line in the game
[2:50:39] <%DensityD> if you know what I mean woolieGASM
[2:50:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus there are ways to improve that chance
[2:50:48] <%rottingpastry> 15% to instakill seems p good
[2:50:49] <%kekkerscrew> Use the charm that doubles the percentage chance
[2:50:51] <medril07> hehe @DensityD
[2:51:08] <ralphfromdk> It will let you do assassination mid combat, so dope
[2:51:16] <%DensityD> be big samurai
[2:51:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I actually had to record one part of shadow of war, because some guy showed up and introduced himself, and before his intro cutscene was over he was instakilled IN THE CUTSCENE by a caragor
[2:51:38] <Afterman_> shadow of mordor was amazing
[2:51:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ralphfromdk @jorniev I don't know what the fine print on that is. I just know that some people treat the Silmarillion like the bibble, because of all the parallels, and get all fundamentalist angry about things that defy Eru/God.
[2:51:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
