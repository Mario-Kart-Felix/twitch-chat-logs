[0:02:50] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Bruh the gameplay is fun though
[0:02:52] <Lancaster_H> I tune out on other parts tbh
[0:02:52] <actualemu> teh gameplay is really fun to play
[0:02:55] <%Amaideus> Turns out I like VNs more than RTS
[0:02:57] <%demystify_fist> it's better to watch now
[0:02:57] <%ChoculaUltra> I like to judge Woolie's tactical prowess :)
[0:02:58] <%cache_22> woolieLORE > gameplay for LPs like this.
[0:02:58] <ZaiWolfgang> The true way to watch
[0:02:59] <%Weeewer> Woolie has never realized that killing Kaiju restores his EP which is pretty funny
[0:02:59] <bear_breaker20> punchmom ready to knock down all your theories
[0:02:59] <actualemu> less fun to watch, im sure
[0:02:59] <CaptainBright> man, the strategy gameplay is real fucking good
[0:03:00] <%Amaideus> Who knew
[0:03:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it iiiiiiis what it iiiiiis
[0:03:01] <BlackermanZX> i watch all the gameplay
[0:03:02] <+HazZe16> fun to play okay to watch
[0:03:04] <+JacknZack27> Its fun to play l, not to watch
[0:03:04] <+skyheys> it's great to play
[0:03:05] <%SleepingPliskin> game is fun to play but watching it not so much yeah
[0:03:07] <%sewermonk> an important break though
[0:03:08] <%Lion_kun> Golf was never fun
[0:03:10] <%gatorafan> I like interceptors :)
[0:03:12] <DatAsuna> rood
[0:03:15] <lemonpire> Fun to play for sure
[0:03:17] <%Weeewer> gtfo out of here kid

[0:03:20] <%osaka_daioh> SERIOUSLY
[0:03:21] <%sodamin1> any strategy game is fun to play but not fun to watch
[0:03:22] <Pnutz409> lol
[0:03:22] <CaptainBright> ok Soulsborne wanks, gtfo
[0:03:22] <%Irridium> chill bro
[0:03:24] <%osaka_daioh> HOLY SHIT
[0:03:24] <Zeppelee> Has Woolie played Armored Core?
[0:03:25] <BlackermanZX> he wants more reggie suffering
[0:03:25] <%sodamin1> it's ironic
[0:03:28] <actualemu> hey @WoolieVersus where's punchmoms sweater from
[0:03:29] <+WRATHZOG> Who doesn't like the 13 sentinels playthrough, I'll fight you outside
[0:03:29] <%RyTYoung> NotLikeThis
[0:03:30] <%ChoculaUltra> the tale of Reggarth can wait dammit
[0:03:32] <+jiggy_snipe> he wants to see Reggie suffer
[0:03:35] <%Livelinne> LUL
[0:03:35] <2bnieroperator69z> @WoolieVersus isnt the only thing you have left destruction?
[0:03:36] <%Weeewer> best playthrough
[0:03:36] <+skyheys> "your game sux lmao"
[0:03:36] <lemonpire> This is like the dark souls of visual novels
[0:03:42] <%osaka_daioh> He IS seeing Reggie suffer through 13 Sentinels though!
[0:03:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> Finisb what it on the table breh
[0:03:47] <%cvp5127> just for that you get a fourth recap ep
[0:03:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WoolieVs now presented in 16:9 CINEMATIC WIDESCREEN.
[0:03:52] <Zebroneath> We gotta scrape those juicy bits. Leave no meat un eaten.
[0:03:56] <%sodamin1> @Zeppelee i don't think so, but he totally should right
[0:03:59] <%RyTYoung> Don't do a me and have 39 games on going at the same time NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:04:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That InfernoPlus Video is INSANE
[0:04:10] <Zeppelee> @sodamin1 Yes he should.
[0:04:30] <Althallos> Renya Gouto probably likes gamestop stock a lot, he's pretty good at holding things
[0:04:34] <%ChoculaUltra> we talking about the Blood Gulch pvp revival
[0:04:41] <%sodamin1> i'm thinking Nexus or last raven for a start. or even just the PS3 ones
[0:04:44] <Pnutz409> lol
[0:04:50] <linSP> The life of a hard working memer
[0:04:55] <KnivesEve> did I miss anything?
[0:04:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @woolieversus its only available with the prepare to die edition but NAMCO says no if you didn't buy it before Remastered
[0:05:05] <%cvp5127> i forgot the terminal
[0:05:16] <%Lion_kun> Terminal needs more than 2 shots to be fun.
[0:05:20] <TheRedCoin> TTours
[0:05:22] <%osaka_daioh> The terminal helps you get more money though.
[0:05:22] <Zeppelee> @sodamin1 I still play the PS1 game to this day.
[0:05:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie doesn't like using items this is known
[0:05:25] <%Weeewer> woolie never upgraded the terminal
[0:05:27] <Arweynn> HOARD LIKE DRAGON
[0:05:27] <iosephe> Use meter
[0:05:28] <%RyTYoung> I upgraded the Terminal first
[0:05:28] <Blank9> 99 elixirs
[0:05:32] <%Weeewer> use meter tho
[0:05:33] <+WRATHZOG> That terminal skill for extra turns is gooood
[0:05:35] <Psyramics> if you need to use this to win, you didn't really win
[0:05:36] <+skyheys> USE THE MEGALIXER
[0:05:36] <%gatorafan> what if I need it later? NotLikeThis
[0:05:37] <%takutoots> lol i totally sapmmed the terminal
[0:05:38] <%osaka_daioh> Woolie never looked at the terminal upgrades which is why.
[0:05:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Die with the meter
[0:05:46] <%RyTYoung> @wrathzog literally the first thing I did
[0:05:52] <%great_tj> The Terminal is super good though
[0:05:53] <lemonpire> Terminal could of been upgraded but I didn’t upgrade it on my run so its not really an issue
[0:05:53] <2bnieroperator69z> uses is reset every map
[0:05:53] <%Irridium> I mean I did the same thing. Rarely ever used it
[0:05:56] <Lancaster_H> its literally free
[0:06:00] <%Kriss1827> Terminal is very useful for insane difficulty
[0:06:02] <+MetroidPrimeRib> you can spam the emp wave
[0:06:09] <%jinking79> psaGoblin
[0:06:10] <+MetroidPrimeRib> and beat the game sleepwalking
[0:06:17] <+skyheys> it's a super
[0:06:19] <actualemu> good luck not using it on these last couple fights
[0:06:20] <%RyTYoung> The emp is super useful for getting out of any situation pretty much
[0:06:24] <%AyotoCorp> You can upgrade the terminal to 4 times per level
[0:06:27] <%sodamin1> realistically i can't get into the older ones because the control scheme is so wacky and old. "hmm yes lets not use the right stick at all, what do you mean you want to use the right stick for the camera" @Zeppelee
[0:06:33] <actualemu> games gonna get HARD
[0:06:33] <Zeppelee> The Terminal is there for a very specific reason.
[0:06:37] <%osaka_daioh> I use terminals to get more money.
[0:06:42] <+MetroidPrimeRib> it's not a mega elixer it's a limit break
[0:06:44] <%osaka_daioh> You can use it to times more the money you get though.
[0:06:55] <%RyTYoung> @osaka_daioh by using the score multiplier?
[0:06:55] <+MirTeiwaz_TV> There's a meta-skill you can buy that boosts the point value of kaiju, which is really good
[0:06:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> real talk: does anyone use it for anything other than emps
[0:07:02] <Zeppelee> @sodamin1 Indeed true.
[0:07:03] <%AyotoCorp> Shields
[0:07:07] <linSP> Fire emblem gives you more undo buttons now, it used to suck messing up 30 minutes in
[0:07:08] <%Drunkengen> Is he gonna finish it in this one?
[0:07:12] <+Mundkipz> i only use it for scoreboost in area 4
[0:07:17] <lemonpire> Ep recharge is useful too
[0:07:18] <halfmasks> this is a Mind Goblin everyone has
[0:07:22] <%RyTYoung> @drunkengen yeah most definitely
[0:07:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @cobalt_phoenix_ i use it sometimes for free turns but EMP is strongest
[0:07:28] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant HA↗️HA↘️HA↙️HA↗️
[0:07:28] <%osaka_daioh> extracly.
[0:07:40] <%osaka_daioh> More score means more money
[0:07:52] <%kewlmyc> Would be my GOTY if not for Hades
[0:07:53] <%great_tj> double down on beeing wrong! Stay classy Woolie
[0:08:01] <%Mrbaconator> THE FINALS THO
[0:08:03] <twoto858> What a Grand Finals
[0:08:05] <%jinking79> doodWat doodRage
[0:08:05] <+mauricefaurron> The tournament was so cool
[0:08:06] <%RyTYoung> @osaka_daioh didn't really use the score multi, but I will now so I can grind out everyone's skills, Ty!
[0:08:06] <%JustToWatch> Grand Finals was wild

[0:09:25] <%great_tj> IT DOES
[0:09:39] <%Lion_kun> Punchmom cares not for fighting games
[0:09:40] <%kyh9> The TRUTH is not very good
[0:09:40] <+skyheys> obra dinn hurt my soul...
[0:09:44] <%Irridium> Judgement was also a great-ass Mystery game. Also PS5 version woo!
[0:10:02] <%Irridium> AKA the JJ Abrams method
[0:10:02] <%Lion_kun> PS5 version looks worse than the PS4 lol
[0:10:03] <%nintega010> One Piece is great with that mystery
[0:10:03] <X2Eliah> A.k.a. TV show plotlines
[0:10:05] <%ChoculaUltra> fucking Lost...
[0:10:06] <mortificent> YEYEYEYE Judgment is a really good mystery game
[0:10:09] <%osaka_daioh> osaka_daioh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Terminal has score multiplier so it gives you more money when you beat a stage. It was free money, like this.
[0:10:09] <+PhantomMiG> !time
[0:10:12] <+skyheys> shout out to naruto
[0:10:12] <%cache_22> Remember Game of Thrones?

[0:10:18] <+WRATHZOG> Oh man I forgot about Heroes
[0:10:22] <%great_tj> @cache_22 Who?
[0:10:24] <X2Eliah> Or, hell, the new STAR WARS trilogy.

[0:10:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YO AOT
[0:10:44] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Lost is the zeitgeist example for blowing your mystery premise
[0:10:45] <%RyTYoung> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:10:46] <%takutoots> but Titan yo
[0:10:46] <%Weeewer> AoT so good
[0:10:46] <%Irridium> AOT GOAT
[0:10:47] <Zeppelee> I'm hype for Strive and my boy Anji.
[0:10:47] <%great_tj> AOT THOUGH!
[0:10:49] <X2Eliah> Game of Thrones is the biggest example of the last season absolutely ruining the whole thing
[0:10:52] <%osaka_daioh> ATTACK ON TITAN DOES IT
[0:10:55] <blastazoid00> AoT is next level
[0:10:57] <%SpiritOfOdin> SO GOOD
[0:11:04] <BlackermanZX> Yo season 4 is KILLIN IT
[0:11:05] <%Irridium> reframing
[0:11:08] <DatAsuna> Season 1 actually REMOVED forshadowing in chapter 1 of the manga even. lol
[0:11:08] <%gatorafan> Can't wait for the next months
[0:11:14] <+MetroidPrimeRib> let me tell you about One Piece
[0:11:17] <%osaka_daioh> They CALLED IT FROM THE GET GO
[0:11:26] <%nintega010> AOT does One Piece things. Like Haki
[0:11:26] <+karldeck> The spoiler talk can’t come soon enough
[0:11:28] <%SleepingPliskin> @DatAsuna yeah I fucking noticed when I reread it
[0:11:29] <DatAsuna> S1 AoT is actually a botch and STILL better than most
[0:11:30] <%kewlmyc> AOT is a damn good adaptation. They're killing it
[0:11:30] <%Seancicle> Lotta o handshapes 👉🏻🧠
[0:11:43] <X2Eliah> what
[0:11:47] <+karldeck> I just want Pat you Woolie talk about Titan again
[0:11:54] <%ChoculaUltra> My headcanon is that the tv show ended the way GRRM wanted but the backlash was so massive he's stuck trying to rewrite whatever shit he had planned hence the literal no news on the books despite the show ending almost 2 years ago now.
[0:11:54] <Blank9> leopaldon is FED
[0:11:59] <%cvp5127> woolie is threatening us with guilty gear lore

[0:13:42] <%SleepingPliskin> whats victory?
[0:13:44] <DatAsuna> Really?
[0:13:44] <%zanzibar_junker> Victory has the biggest KAREN
[0:13:47] <mortificent> Victory is fucking wild
[0:13:48] <%Mrbaconator> RENYA GOATO
[0:13:48] <%Lion_kun> Watching Stardust memory right now
[0:13:49] <%JustToWatch> are you saying that people have opinions about gundam
[0:13:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Yo talk about Attack on Titan!!
[0:13:50] <Zeppelee> G Gundam is Best Gundam.
[0:13:50] <alrobot2014> the only thing i know about Victory is bikini babe assault and i can't wait to get to it
[0:13:52] <%kyh9> Reggie Gouto
[0:13:54] <DatAsuna> From the outside it seemed like unicorn had all the hype
[0:14:02] <%Weeewer> When you use it
[0:14:03] <Blank9> victory goes off the rails harder than any other
[0:14:04] <Lancaster_H> use
[0:14:04] <%Weeewer> Its a skill
[0:14:05] <DatAsuna> but if people like victory that's encouraging
[0:14:05] <%sewermonk> when you use it
[0:14:06] <+skyheys> use
[0:14:06] <%ZweihanderSteve> gundam victory is the last Gundam the creator directed because he went a little off the rails
[0:14:07] <%osaka_daioh> When you use it
[0:14:08] <%Juriasu> Juriasu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! woolieCHAN
[0:14:11] <Blank9> if you know Brain Powerd, think that
[0:14:12] <%great_tj> when you use it
[0:14:13] <%Lion_kun> Stardust has Nina Purpleton whose a big Karen.
[0:14:14] <%Weeewer> There's a skill called Score Boost
[0:14:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GUN TO YOUR HEAD CHAT: reggie notebook or gouto notebook
[0:14:17] <thesilverbard> Victory is around the middle of Gundam scale in terms of quality
[0:14:18] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus There's an active and passive score booster
[0:14:18] <+skyheys> no, skill
[0:14:18] <Reusing6776> Theres a score multiplier skill
[0:14:20] <%gatorafan> Reggie took NOTES
[0:14:23] <X2Eliah> gouto notebook ofc
[0:14:26] <DatAsuna> Okay I'll take this as a yes on watching victory then. lol
[0:14:29] <Lancaster_H> imagine reading skills
[0:14:30] <+MetroidPrimeRib> theres both
[0:14:32] <+JacknZack27> There’s a skill you can use
[0:14:38] <%Weeewer> More importantly there's a skill called Heal EP which restores EP for everyone
[0:14:39] <+skyheys> there are two skills
[0:14:40] <Blank9> honestly, I'd recommend gundam x as a random one more than victory
[0:14:42] <CappuccinoGuil> there's no reason to NOT use it, though
[0:14:44] <%Weeewer> And Instant Cooldown reduction
[0:14:47] <CaptainBright> For anyone who finishes Victory, you need to instantly watch Turn A to cleanse your mind and soul of that show's KAREN energy
[0:14:47] <+skyheys> passive and active
[0:14:52] <%osaka_daioh> JAIL TIME?!
[0:14:54] <%osaka_daioh> JAIL TIME.
[0:14:55] <%zanzibar_junker> Victory is great
[0:14:57] <X2Eliah> Okay, 2 battles and game over!
[0:14:57] <+0ni0n_L0rd> JAIL!
[0:14:57] <+MetroidPrimeRib> it's a limit break not an elixer
[0:14:57] <NeonBleu> The time has come
[0:14:58] <BlackermanZX> Jail UP
[0:15:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yay jail time!
[0:15:03] <%cache_22> Time to lock down.
[0:15:03] <thesilverbard> Turn A is so much better than Victory

[0:15:12] <CaptainBright> Let me in, Kamala
[0:15:12] <%Lion_kun> Is there a point to jail?
[0:15:13] <Blank9> the best part about victory is uso is the most creative main pilot in the series
[0:15:13] <OblivionSword1> LET ME INNNN
[0:15:13] <%osaka_daioh> TURN AAAAAAAAAA
[0:15:14] <%gatorafan> At this point let's just not use it

[0:15:23] <%AyotoCorp> Might want to take another look at the Terminal skills now that you have more cash
[0:15:28] <artoflec> its really for the higher difficulty imo, it mostly just overwhelms you but its fun

[0:57:14] <%ZweihanderSteve> ZweihanderSteve subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Thanks for playing 13 Sentinels! When I bought it on release last year I was expecting a normal, good ass Vanillaware game. Instead 13 Sentinels got me back into video games. I think I'm ready to get into fighting games now. :)

[2:25:54] <summonerron> A HUNDRED YEARS
[2:25:56] <Alzero83> Final Phase: Growth
[2:25:59] <%Amaideus> Stories always mess that up
[2:26:02] <jorniev> IM TOTALLY RIGHT
[2:26:04] <Althallos> @bread_assassin Nanomachines were mostly in charge of making them believe the simulation
[2:26:11] <Sol_Install> yea pretty much
[2:26:13] <%Amaideus> It's prime fanfic fodder too
[2:26:17] <%osaka_daioh> Yeah it's not going to work XD
[2:26:18] <brachydios777> This is happening across different probes on different planets teraformed , right?
[2:26:19] <%Weeewer> LUL
[2:26:23] <linSP> time to boot up that genetic material and make it think
[2:26:25] <BanquoViaquo> Like Tamao said, it's also about weaving the tapestry.

[2:26:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Raised By Wolfs
[2:26:39] <halfmasks> @brachydios777 this plot is happening with every probe out there
[2:26:40] <%Amaideus> @brachydios777 Correct
[2:26:42] <%Weeewer> Minami x Ogata in the other planet LETS GOOOO
[2:26:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Amaideus FUCK
[2:26:45] <heartlesshealer> that's the purpose of simulation brains
[2:26:45] <pixel_river> inifinte yakisopan lovers across space
[2:26:50] <jorniev> IS IT ONLY 15 KIDS?
[2:26:52] <+Sp3ctre48> @brachydios777 Yes the probes self replicated, so there may be thousands of probes that are experiencing the same thing
[2:26:52] <heartlesshealer> yes
[2:26:52] <MyNameIsRasus> EVERY SHIP IS CANON
[2:26:52] <%RyTYoung> Miwako is infinite, remember that
[2:26:53] <IndoorSitup> I'm confused, is that "other probe" stinger meant to be ominous??
[2:26:53] <halfmasks> INFINTE PROBE WORKS
[2:26:54] <+Jaromero435> ALL SHIPS ARE REAL
[2:26:55] <NeonBleu> we skip the cavemen stage
[2:27:03] <YaminoRaiden> The MEMES of humanity
[2:27:07] <KeroKamina> @jorniev 15 japanese kids apparently
[2:27:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Only Japan tho
[2:27:13] <BanquoViaquo> Speedrun neolithic age.
[2:27:14] <pixel_river> speedrun humanity before birth
[2:27:15] <%AMUSERNAME> ALL THE STARS IN THE SIDE ARE 13 SENTINELS PARALLEL UNIVERSES PogChamp
[2:27:16] <brachydios777> So humanity is now potentialy Infinite
[2:27:18] <%nintega010> I like how this and Horizon are different sides of this story
[2:27:19] <CaptainBright> @jorniev Yes, 15 individuals corresponding with the 15 survivors in 2188
[2:27:20] <jorniev> thats the weidest part to me
[2:27:21] <+fetrigon> my head is fucking spinning with that last cutscene NotLikeThis LUL
[2:27:23] <Mushinronja> @IndoorSitup nah, just that the same story is happening on multiple planets
[2:27:23] <%AMUSERNAME> *sky
[2:27:24] <+jiggy_snipe> @IndoorSitup it's just 13 Sentinels happening on many terraformed planets
[2:27:24] <heartlesshealer> 15 kids and then clone babies alongside
[2:27:26] <+skyheys> 18 and then 2 years
[2:27:28] <ZaiWolfgang> All AU's are canon here
[2:27:32] <hassanico2> @IndoorSitup It's bad and good.
[2:27:34] <%cvp5127> doent matter they can alter gees
[2:27:36] <+DontMindMee> I guess this got interrupted by the loops at 16?
[2:27:38] <CappuccinoGuil> 18 years and 2 of training
[2:27:39] <%cvp5127> genes
[2:27:42] <linSP> how many probes were sent? INFINITE

[2:27:52] <%Irridium> @IndoorSitup just means probes landed on other planets, and this type of thing is happening all over. we just followed one group
[2:27:53] <%Amaideus> Humanity CAN'T go extinct now
[2:27:54] <SideChar> 18 then 2 years of training
[2:27:55] <%Lion_kun> Lolimura
[2:27:56] <hassanico2> @IndoorSitup The idea is there's tons of probes doing this and possibly not succeeding, and maybe others that solved the problem way faster. We'll never know.
[2:27:58] <%Livelinne> Aw shiiiiieeeeet shiaPog
[2:27:59] <%Amaideus> BEcause they have backups on backups on backups
[2:27:59] <CappuccinoGuil> So the Kaiju was literally just a test to see if they could survive outside?
[2:28:04] <+Sp3ctre48> Yes the simulation got interrupted before it was supposed to end when they were 18, so it would fall into a loop
[2:28:04] <Iphantom99> variations of the same story happening on other planets. That's why they paired Natsuno and Ogata who barely interact in the main story
[2:28:05] <CaptainBright> Probes weren't infinite; they just multiplied exponentially
[2:28:06] <%Amaideus> For the entirety of the universe
[2:28:08] <Lukas_Ipsum> aliens exist, we made them all!
[2:28:10] <pixel_river> George kamitani said this is an coming of age story in his western release celebration
[2:28:14] <hassanico2> @CappuccinoGuil No, that was original Ryoko Sabotage
[2:28:14] <jorniev> I don't know man this end feels kinda weird
[2:28:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[2:28:15] <%Livelinne> All AU IS CANON NotLikeThis
[2:28:16] <BearSawed> Well you see king Arthur was actually a women and you summoned her to fight in a battle royale
[2:28:17] <Blank9> the whole game took place in one probe, the same thing's happening in other probes, kaiju are 2188 shinonome's virus that infected them all
[2:28:18] <X2Eliah> The Kaiju was a bug introduced by the og shinonome
[2:28:20] <Psyramics> @CappuccinoGuil No, it was sabotage from original Ryoko
[2:28:21] <Mushinronja> @CappuccinoGuil The kaiju was Shononome's shit, it wasn't supposed to happen
[2:28:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @cappuccinoguil no Ryoko 2188 wanted to fuck up humanity
[2:28:25] <corinv> No, the kaiju were never meant to e part of it
[2:28:26] <+jiggy_snipe> @CappuccinoGuil seems to be a virus to fuck up the process
[2:28:26] <%Irridium> @CappuccinoGuil no, they were a bug, basically. On account of Shinonome's virus and Okino copy/pasting a game's AI code into this
[2:28:27] <%Weeewer> The Deimos are 100% Ryoko bugs
[2:28:27] <ZaiWolfgang> I cant wait for the vannilaware game of aliens fighting off humanity probes
[2:28:27] <%cvp5127> human plus nanobots plus ai
[2:28:28] <DubiousRhino> The kaiju were an error - a sabotage by 2188 Ryoko Shinonome to stop the Ark project
[2:28:32] <Althallos> @CappuccinoGuil No, the kaiju were about because 2188 shinonome fucked with the code
[2:28:32] <Twistedwolfie> JUST LIKE THE REAL WORLD
[2:28:36] <YaminoRaiden> Actually yes. First one
[2:28:39] <brunoberserk> this giving me some nier/ergo proxy vibes
[2:28:40] <Iphantom99> the kaiju were not part of the plan
[2:28:40] <heartlesshealer> matrix babies with time release, it seems
[2:28:41] <%takutoots> @CappuccinoGuil Kaiju was locked in the code because Okino was lazy
[2:28:42] <%great_tj> Kaiju were Shinonomes "Kill all humans" plan, Not part of what was originally planned
[2:28:45] <brachydios777> How many probes were there?
[2:28:47] <Malikwest11> I think it would be a mix of boyh
[2:28:48] <%SouLucha> Just 15.
[2:28:50] <X2Eliah> Other human mind Ai, 15 DNAs
[2:28:54] <%Irridium> @brachydios777 thousands
[2:28:54] <%Amaideus> They have a giant fucking DNA bank too
[2:28:55] <Isord> No. just the 15
[2:28:57] <Reusing6776> It would work like okino right?
[2:28:58] <linSP> age the babies and then inject them with the ai’s
[2:29:00] <hassanico2> They have 6 million Human DNAs
[2:29:01] <SideChar> just the 15
[2:29:01] <Arancet> they had general genetic data, not specific people
[2:29:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Just 15 DNA
[2:29:02] <%Weeewer> The project looped ONLY BECAUSE ryoko would cause the 15 children to die in the pod and loop
[2:29:04] <+Raspada_Ryner> Only flora and fauna
[2:29:04] <LycheeMusings> Punch Mom is right
[2:29:05] <%Miles_Hikari> I hope they read the QA interview that explains things not in the game
[2:29:07] <%SkellyVee> 15
[2:29:07] <%Kriss1827> other humas are AI only 15 have dna
[2:29:09] <+Jaromero435> Only 15, the rest is plants and shit
[2:29:09] <halfmasks> JUST 15
[2:29:09] <DubiousRhino> Woolie is wrong - the genetic data is for the flora & fauna of the planet
[2:29:09] <%SouLucha> The rest is data.
[2:29:10] <%SleepingPliskin> its just the 15
[2:29:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im calling it now that ryoko didn't add new code, just uncommented the code okino commented out from the game
[2:29:12] <fuji_92> its both
[2:29:12] <+skyheys> It's just 15
[2:29:13] <Psyramics> They only have the 15, and use genetic engineering to fake up the rest
[2:29:13] <+JacknZack27> Theres a dna bank
[2:29:14] <+shancheez> just 15
[2:29:16] <pixel_river> Thats why there is DNA in the menu chat PogChamp
[2:29:17] <alphalejandro> The original Shinonome was a salty EX wasn't she
[2:29:17] <%Aceofstaves> there's a DNA bank guys
[2:29:18] <+abrupt_abe> Just the 15, but it was an ark for other things
[2:29:19] <%cvp5127> theres a bank
[2:29:21] <Lukas_Ipsum> the ship has genetic info for 1.2 million people, but it has genetic material for 15 survivors
[2:29:21] <+jiggy_snipe> I think they are gonna genetic engineer based off AI and the 15 dna
[2:29:22] <+Zasne> Yes, Tamao has genetic data on all flora, fauana, and human diversity
[2:29:22] <OneSassyMoogle> They figured out a way to design a biological body that matches the AI body kupo
[2:29:22] <+JacknZack27> Its not just the 15
[2:29:22] <EndgameContent> Can't you just print them out?
[2:29:23] <+BlueJoneleth> There's 6 million DNA samples.
[2:29:23] <Blank9> just the 15
[2:29:23] <+Sp3ctre48> They were expecting a population for 6 million people when all was said and done
[2:29:24] <%takutoots> Ryoko planned to repopulate Earth after the nano plauge
[2:29:24] <%JustToWatch> it's both
[2:29:25] <Twistedwolfie> just 15
[2:29:27] <thesilverbard> they said there would be massive human cloning efforts
[2:29:31] <+skyheys> they're using genetic engineering to bullshit it
[2:29:31] <%cvp5127> 15 real ppl
[2:29:31] <blastazoid00> They said they had a DNA bank
[2:29:33] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus It's exactly 6 Million people's DNAs, 1.2 Million per sector.
[2:29:34] <%takutoots> bu tthey went with Ark in the end
[2:29:37] <+Unajer> 15 clones, generic information for brand new humans
[2:29:37] <%great_tj> Also Human DNA
[2:29:39] <fuji_92> theres a DNA bank, and they'll bring the simulated ppl to real life
[2:29:40] <OneSassyMoogle> They do have a database kupo
[2:29:40] <EndgameContent> There are only 15 direct descendents
[2:29:41] <%Livelinne> Goddamnit Ryoko woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:29:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Ryoko fucked up humanity, 15 were left and made into clones
[2:29:46] <blastazoid00> They just grew the 15
[2:29:46] <%Miles_Hikari> Use DNA Bank to make new humans, and put the A in their brains
[2:29:48] <%AMUSERNAME> EVENT ARCHIVE NOW LISTS LOOP NUMBER ON EVENTS!! PogChamp
[2:29:49] <TukeArt> They only have DNA of 15 people, but they're researching to make more
[2:29:53] <+sombraxyz> there is a back of DNA, they are 15 descendants
[2:29:54] <%r0chelimit> They have millions of people DNA, they just entrusted 15 people to get the society working first
[2:29:55] <+Cecil_FF4> Yeah woolie is correct I think
[2:29:56] <KeroKamina> GENETIC REMIXING SO THAT THEY AREN't JUST THE 15 BIOLOGICALLY
[2:29:58] <BanquoViaquo> Professor Tamao mentioned that there would be species-restoration efforts for humans too, even if they needed to be educated.
[2:29:58] <+JacknZack27> 15 direct clones, but they have the ability to make new people
[2:29:59] <pixel_river> its cool the DNA on the right was a spoiler all along
[2:30:00] <LycheeMusings> Reggie VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[2:30:01] <X2Eliah> 15 copies of real DNA, + millions of random DNAs
[2:30:02] <MyNameIsRasus> They had the genetic information for everyone else, but the DNA for the 15 i THINK
[2:30:03] <enZymeth> They have DNA of other people
[2:30:05] <%slayabee> It is
[2:30:06] <heartlesshealer> memory forms = 1.2 million, physical vessels = 15 unless clone
[2:30:15] <brachydios777> They have dna for a diversity of people, the kids were the test runs, correct?
[2:30:17] <+Zasne> The 15 were the only ones who go through the virtual training - the simulation - to be the leaders
[2:30:17] <%Weeewer> Nope not the last
[2:30:18] <Iphantom99> Morimura killed humanity and Ryoko sabotaged the remaining 15 actually
[2:30:22] <+froduck42> Orginal Tamao aid they had a variety of human dns
[2:30:23] <%Weeewer> Press L1 and R1
[2:30:24] <%osaka_daioh> Almost, looka t the character names too
[2:30:24] <%wibbwobbler> this is so much for humans, too complicated, no more humans lmao
[2:30:26] <irfan_> press L1 R1
[2:30:28] <Iphantom99> well tried to sabotage
[2:30:29] <%osaka_daioh> Look at the character names on the top
[2:30:31] <jubejube56> There was a reference I believe to have a larger population but that was before the nanomachine apocalypse where only 15 humans survived to work on Project Ark
[2:30:31] <%Livelinne> grymPOG grymPOG grymPOG
[2:30:32] <%Miles_Hikari> Original 15 come out, use DNA Bamk to make new humans, apply AI to new human brains
[2:30:32] <+Unajer> 15 clones, generic information for brand new humans, AND they're gonna make the AI people into real humans
[2:30:34] <+JacknZack27> We’d be doomed if it was just the 15
[2:30:34] <%SouLucha> Remember the part you just played is ONE loop.
[2:30:35] <%Aceofstaves> 15 people, a million ai personalities, and an extensive DNA bank
[2:30:36] <%takutoots> yep
[2:30:37] <%Weeewer> YES
[2:30:37] <%osaka_daioh> THERE YOU GO

[2:31:12] <%SouLucha> THIS is why some files didn't line up.
[2:31:12] <aiwass8> 15 direct descendants, many genetic cash for people, animals and plants
[2:31:14] <%Amaideus> I love that this game is its own wiki
[2:31:19] <%Amaideus> That's fucking god tier
[2:31:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OblivionSword1
[2:31:22] <+spardanwarrior> Even tells you which sector each event takes place in
[2:31:24] <%osaka_daioh> THERE YOU FUCKING GO, WHAT YOU COMPALINED ABOUT
[2:31:26] <+MostRefinedCalla> Now he sees why Juro events aren’t in Juro
[2:31:29] <OblivionSword1> Sorry moobot
[2:31:29] <CappuccinoGuil> GAME OF A GENERATION
[2:31:31] <%osaka_daioh> It's all so fucking beautiful
[2:31:37] <pixel_river> Yeag GTOY, back to discussion LUL
[2:31:39] <%SouLucha> TLoU2? Hardly know it.
[2:31:41] <%SkellyVee> So they want to bring the ai to life
[2:31:41] <%SaiyanShoto> Hearing that without looking sounds so wrong LUL LUL
[2:31:50] <%illtima> Can you even imagine how long the spoilercast is going to be
[2:31:51] <%SkellyVee> by they are working on it
[2:31:51] <+sombraxyz> "Dawn" may be the other to look at
[2:31:52] <Sol_Install> I want to scream that I can't play this game on PC
[2:31:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck yeah more of this song
[2:31:53] <%Miles_Hikari> Original 15 come out, use DNA Bamk to make new humans, apply AI to new human brains
[2:31:57] <Sol_Install> Along with there other line up
[2:32:04] <%Weeewer> Woolie you’re looking for what Tamao Kurabe said @woolieversus
[2:32:05] <%Amaideus> What @Miles_Hikari said
[2:32:05] <+Unajer> the message from Tamao 2188 talks about the genetic cache
[2:32:08] <Sol_Install> I really want villinaware on pc
[2:32:10] <+jiggy_snipe> Tamao 2188
[2:32:11] <brachydios777> Also the ending is a combination of Total Recall and Matrix 3
[2:32:13] <%Weeewer> Message from Tamao Kurabe
[2:32:16] <SHADIC7> Miura 2188
[2:32:19] <jubejube56> I think you are looking for the 2188 log between Minami and Ogata?
[2:32:22] <blastazoid00> The tamao message
[2:32:26] <T_Sasquatch> i cant wait to watch this entire lp years from now and feel regret because i didn't care at the time KomodoHype
[2:32:26] <%SkellyVee> ^
[2:32:27] <+JacknZack27> Tamao 2188 is what your looking for
[2:32:28] <linSP> how you gonna use the 15 pods to make all million city people
[2:32:30] <+netrac> Publish the Reggie notes
[2:32:30] <CappuccinoGuil> THIS GAME Kreygasm
[2:32:31] <+BlueJoneleth> Conversation between 2188 Nenji & Natsuno they mention 6 million people.
[2:32:31] <+NemuiNemu> BEST GAME
[2:32:51] <%Amaideus> They can make more pods
[2:32:55] <%Amaideus> They obviously have the tech to
[2:32:55] <bear_breaker20> @linSP nanomachines son
[2:32:56] <%kyh9> This game has THE BEST wiki
[2:32:56] <%SouLucha> That was before shit hit the fan.
[2:32:57] <MyNameIsRasus> The probes self replicate
[2:32:57] <+0ni0n_L0rd> 15 real people. 1.2 million AI people. 6 Million DNA samples for future real people.
[2:32:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> probe rain
[2:32:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> GAME OF THE DECADE RIGHT HERE
[2:32:59] <%Weeewer> I don’t think they realize Ryoko is the reason for the loops
[2:33:06] <summonerron> how many probes
[2:33:07] <%Amaideus> They recreated the entire city and shit despite the planet having TWO MOONS
[2:33:08] <+Sp3ctre48> And the probes reproduced more probes
[2:33:11] <%takutoots> many MANY probes
[2:33:13] <%Aceofstaves> @0ni0n_l0rd precisely
[2:33:17] <%Miles_Hikari> There's a QA interview with the games developer that explains things not in the game. I really hope that Woolie and friends read it
[2:33:18] <%Weeewer> The probes were a living organism
[2:33:19] <HeroToxiko> most of humanity came from a small group so world seeding can happen
[2:33:21] <+Sp3ctre48> So there maybe thousands of them out there
[2:33:24] <brachydios777> They saved humanity and now it is potential bigger than ever with the other probes succeding too.
[2:33:34] <%jepupu> I can't imagine how hard it was to make a story like that sensible.
[2:33:34] <MyNameIsRasus> The probes make more probes, they're functionally infinite
[2:33:37] <HeroToxiko> and im talking anthropology not religion
[2:33:40] <%Razputin217> Narrative not as good as the Last of Us 2, right Geoff? Kappa
[2:33:41] <%SouLucha> The Interstellar project was started before Earth went to shit, was planned for many more people, but then only 15 made it out.
[2:33:41] <%Livelinne> serfMoonlord serfMoonlord
[2:33:58] <%takutoots> self repair and replicate they might even make a full circle of the universe
[2:34:05] <%SkellyVee> yeye
[2:34:07] <Iphantom99> the construction/presentation of the story is almost more impressive than the story itself
[2:34:08] <%osaka_daioh> aaaaaah.
[2:34:09] <pixel_river> pretty impressive Kamitani both wrote and directed this
[2:34:16] <%osaka_daioh> Actually nice Woolie
[2:34:20] <brachydios777> This is a master piece of video game story telling
[2:34:22] <Iphantom99> Kamitani absolute legend status
[2:34:22] <MyNameIsRasus> nice catch
[2:34:23] <+Zasne> The 15 are the only ones to go through the simulation, so they're educated and trained to lead the new world
[2:34:26] <%cvp5127> they can make more ppl
[2:34:27] <%Amaideus> It genuinely is
[2:34:27] <KeroKamina> ooooooh
[2:34:30] <%Weeewer> Sasuga, Woolie
[2:34:31] <Arancet> think they mean general human dna, not specific people
[2:34:33] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus There's a QnA done by the game devs that answers stuff not in the game.
[2:34:33] <%Irridium> imagine not giving this narrative of the year at The Game Awards
[2:34:37] <%Aceofstaves> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:34:37] <%Weeewer> Yeah it’s general human data
[2:34:38] <+Unajer> yeah.
[2:34:39] <%Amaideus> It's so hard to build a story like this and have it be anywhere near coherent
[2:34:40] <%Weeewer> Like races
[2:34:44] <%Miles_Hikari> The QA: https://www.frontlinejp.net/2020/09/29/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-spoiler-qa-with-george-kamitani/
[2:34:44] <brachydios777> They knew the adam and eve situation would be a problem
[2:34:48] <heartlesshealer> Gene editing can force diversity
[2:34:49] <%Amaideus> Especially when you're letting people see it out of order
[2:34:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Plus, Gouto says they have FIVE bases. Why make that many for just 15 people?
[2:34:54] <KeroKamina> fantastic catch
[2:34:57] <+Zasne> no it cant be both ways, it's clear and cut
[2:35:02] <%AMUSERNAME> Big library of human DNA data, but our 15 are the only ones with DIRECT DNA SAMPLES.
[2:35:03] <+whyskeywolfe> If you have cloning you have genetic templates that you can diversify.
[2:35:03] <%Aceofstaves> it's very clear
[2:35:04] <%Weeewer> Woolie is right
[2:35:06] <+Unajer> the 15 of you HOWEVER
[2:35:06] <DubiousRhino> Yeah basically they provided a bunch of genetic ID for humans, which the 15 are figuring out how to use the pods to create real humans
[2:35:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie is correct
[2:35:11] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Bruh...
[2:35:14] <+jiggy_snipe> Ryoko also said they were gonna genetic engineer
[2:35:17] <+jiggy_snipe> dw about it
[2:35:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:35:23] <Psyramics> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[2:35:25] <%Aceofstaves> the alteration is so the ai are in their "own" bodies as real humans
[2:35:29] <brachydios777> Human dna , not just the 15
[2:35:34] <+JacknZack27> They would be doomed if they were only able to continue humans with 15 people
[2:35:35] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @IndoorSitup
[2:35:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they have the blocks but they gotta put it together
[2:35:44] <Lancaster_H> there is the dna, just no bodies, YET
[2:35:47] <%Livelinne> Ok this game got ignored on TGA is an absolute INSULT. What a trash woolieTRASH NotLikeThis woolieTRASH
[2:35:49] <heartlesshealer> put that one back
[2:35:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Elon? oh shit, toss that DNA in the sink
[2:35:55] <%JustToWatch> I think the genetic engineering is to make the bodies the same as the simulation bodies
[2:35:58] <%Weeewer> Woolie omega right
[2:36:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Livelinne it's TGA what did you expect
[2:36:02] <twoto858> 15 Japanese kids do not represent all of humanity; the large genetic cash pool is needed
[2:36:13] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, what @JustToWatch said for the memory form people

[2:38:22] <+Zasne> That;s because of Ryoko!!!
[2:38:26] <%Amaideus> It's just the matrix
[2:38:26] <arkv01> wait so this project means eventually you CAN fuck yourself

[2:38:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NANOMACHINES SON
[2:38:31] <MyNameIsRasus> RYOKO DID IT ALL
[2:38:32] <%Amaideus> Thank god I saw that shit as a kid

[2:38:35] <%Amaideus> Alright chat

[2:38:40] <%Amaideus> Is Ryoko the worst girl?

[2:38:50] <%cvp5127> blame ida

[2:38:54] <ShepherdShang> What would people do if "the real world" really was fake?
[2:38:56] <%Miles_Hikari> Ryoko's real motives are in the QA interview
[2:39:00] <%Weeewer> ONE GIRL oh no
[2:39:02] <DubiousRhino> 2188 Ryoko fucked the simulation up to try and make it restart constantly until the facility breaks down
[2:39:02] <+skyheys> Teens would literally kill themselves if they found out dad is fake at 12 Woolie
[2:39:02] <IndoorSitup> O N E G I R L

[2:39:20] <Iphantom99> I'm torn because she kind of ruins everything but on the other hand Hayamin
[2:39:21] <Lukas_Ipsum> but why does japan still lose?
[2:39:21] <%kewlmyc> The Kaiji attacking is all Ryoko 2188's fault.
[2:39:27] <%JustToWatch> so wait was the structure with the five sectors actually real?
[2:39:32] <%Livelinne> joofbSweat
[2:39:32] <%baka_sugoi> why she gotta look so pretty tho BibleThump
[2:39:34] <%uoblivion> ryoko 2188 worst girl
[2:39:36] <%Miles_Hikari> There's a bit more to original ryoko's story not found in the game
[2:39:38] <%Amaideus> The amount of degeneracy that would happen if everyone found out they and everyone else was "fake" would be
[2:39:39] <%SkellyVee> So Okino told Ryoko about the programming so when Ida fucked her over she ruined the code to make sure humanity suffers
[2:39:42] <%Amaideus> Absolutely disgusting
[2:39:43] <Iphantom99> also double turrets, what a woman
[2:39:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the 5 sectors were only for the simulation though no?
[2:39:46] <MyNameIsRasus> What a simp
[2:39:46] <alrobot2014> @Iphantom99 it's such a hard decision
[2:39:48] <CappuccinoGuil> All because she was dumped, damn
[2:39:50] <KeroKamina> 2188 ryoko worst girl
[2:39:51] <%Weeewer> The children die each loop
[2:39:53] <IndoorSitup> O N E G A L
[2:39:55] <%Weeewer> Their bodies are broken down
[2:39:58] <%Weeewer> It’s tucked up
[2:40:00] <%Livelinne> Too salty for humanity
[2:40:01] <%Miles_Hikari> @CappuccinoGuil That's not actually why
[2:40:05] <%SouLucha> Infinite Kaiju Works.
[2:40:05] <+Sp3ctre48> Yes the 5 sectors was within the virtual world
[2:40:07] <%Amaideus> People already do horrible shit in the real world, imagine how much worse it'd be if everyone knew it was fake
[2:40:08] <alphalejandro> 2188 Ryoko was a very salty EX
[2:40:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @Miles_Hikari shhhhhhh let me have my jokes
[2:40:12] <Isord> KEEP READING
[2:40:13] <+JacknZack27> She was having a really bad week to be fair
[2:40:14] <+Cecil_FF4> Yeah their real bodies were constantly dying
[2:40:14] <soul_survive> she simped so hard she fucked humanity in the process
[2:40:18] <+Unajer> CHECK ALL FILES
[2:40:19] <MyNameIsRasus> READ
[2:40:21] <pixel_river> its int the files right?
[2:40:21] <%Weeewer> @woolieversus it’s confirmed that they die in the pod each tome
[2:40:24] <%SkellyVee> the nano machines killed them with each loop reset
[2:40:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> body is gooped then redone
[2:40:25] <Alzero83> Regrowth
[2:40:26] <heartlesshealer> Check more files
[2:40:27] <%slayabee> Loop
[2:40:28] <DatAsuna> fuck humanity because I love you too much
[2:40:28] <linSP> READ THE MANGA
[2:40:31] <%Irridium> you flew past Ida
[2:40:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[2:40:36] <%Miles_Hikari> Ryoko's real motives are not in the files, only in the QA
[2:40:36] <Arancet> yes
[2:40:36] <ShepherdShang> It is implied the bodies get recycled and new ones are grown each loop
[2:40:37] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KeroKamina
[2:40:38] <+Zasne> Yes
[2:40:38] <reonome> yes
[2:40:39] <pixel_river> JAIL TIME ?
[2:40:39] <jfp4life> so there's a basement filled with dead bodies somewhere?
[2:40:40] <%SouLucha> They get turned into soup each time they fail.
[2:40:40] <%kewlmyc> VoteYay
[2:40:41] <+jiggy_snipe> go back to Ida
[2:40:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ryoko....was the coolest girl
[2:40:42] <+skyheys> The files explain!
[2:40:43] <%takutoots> I think the bodies reamined but the virutal world starts over
[2:40:45] <thesilverbard> In sympathy to Ryoko, literally the last other person in the world betrayed her.
[2:40:50] <brachydios777> They literally put in their own wiki in the game
[2:40:52] <corinv> @CappuccinoGuil There's a cut scene where basically she and Ida were the last two alive in humanity, she asked for him to kill himself with her, and he rejected, dumped her, then went off on his own
[2:41:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @KeroKamina no they would loop forever, all the bodies die each loop
[2:41:03] <%ZweihanderSteve> the body in the pod dies, and if they were backed up to sector 0 then they lived on
[2:41:06] <%takutoots> they are getting over every loop?
[2:41:11] <arkv01> mass VR genocide
[2:41:11] <%Amaideus> Holy shit
[2:41:12] <%takutoots> *older?
[2:41:14] <IndoorSitup> This shit was done over 20 million fucking years. Imagine how many clones were killed
[2:41:16] <+BigCoffee> If they fail they get broken down, and remade
[2:41:17] <%Amaideus> She tried a suicide pact
[2:41:23] <+Unajer> fake time is real time
[2:41:25] <%Amaideus> Absolutely the worst girl confirmed
[2:41:33] <%SouLucha> Each failed loop is a a clone being reset, into soilent green.
[2:41:36] <+BigCoffee> Yeah but she was like, one of the last 2 Ama
[2:41:37] <brachydios777> @indoorsitup Well some of that was travel time
[2:41:40] <CappuccinoGuil> I am disappointed that Okino and Hijiyama don't get an "I love you" moment at the ending, though.
[2:41:43] <+BigCoffee> They where dying anyway
[2:41:45] <%Amaideus> Fuyusaka might be boring, but at least learning more about her doesn't make me hate her even more
[2:41:48] <Psyramics> @IndoorSitup There were over 300 loops, so this has been going on for around 5000 years, on this one planet
[2:41:50] <%cvp5127> its a lot of peoples fault
[2:41:55] <Lancaster_H> @IndoorSitup not necessarily, we dont know exactly how many millions of years passed travelling to the new galaxy
[2:42:01] <IndoorSitup> @psyramics Ah, my b
[2:42:02] <+BigCoffee> @CappuccinoGuil You know he's dicking Okino down :p
[2:42:10] <pixel_river> itl be fiiine
[2:42:21] <Iphantom99> yeah Hijiyama still having cold feet is my biggest issue with the story
[2:42:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:42:22] <IndoorSitup> But still, that's a LOT of dead kids
[2:42:24] <%SouLucha> 2188 Morimura is a Karma Houdini.
[2:42:24] <%takutoots> using RTS to save humanity
[2:42:29] <reonome> @CappuccinoGuil they're already fucking its fine
[2:42:34] <%Amaideus> Hijiyama ain't having cold feet
[2:42:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @BigCoffee which is fine, but we gays deserve cute I love you scenes too, damn it
[2:42:38] <%Miles_Hikari> I think its implied Hijiyama is super torn between loving Okino, and helping grow humanity with Tamao. The purest exampl of a bi disaster
[2:42:44] <%Amaideus> Okino practically went "check my taint again bro"
[2:42:58] <reonome> @CappuccinoGuil technically the 2188 versions got the scene
[2:42:58] <%JustToWatch> gotta wonder if the devs played Horizon Zero Dawn, because there are a LOT of similarities there
[2:43:01] <%cvp5127> but not those ppl
[2:43:03] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus you passed by Ida (2188) it's got some new stuff I think just FYI
[2:43:12] <%osaka_daioh> exactly
[2:43:15] <%osaka_daioh> which is why there's 5 sectors
[2:43:19] <+BigCoffee> @CappuccinoGuil true, but he's a tsundere from ww2, he's doing his best, and was probably shy around tamao
[2:43:28] <KeroKamina> did the pods need to look so uncomfortable tho?
[2:43:29] <%Weeewer> It’s a analogy for game development tbh

[2:44:50] <+Jaromero435> When a loop ends, does the growth pod get flushed?
[2:44:58] <CaptainBright> You know what's fucked? Besides all the Hijiyama X Okino BL porn, there is only one doujin for 13 sentinels and who does it feature? M I W A K O
[2:45:00] <+Dragon4234> @WoolieVersus You skipped some entries

[2:45:10] <+skyheys> my favorite unstated detail is that baby chihiro treats her bunny as a surrogate okino
[2:45:10] <%Miles_Hikari> It does yes
[2:45:10] <%SouLucha> @Jaromero435 Yes.

[2:45:44] <+Zasne> you skipped a lot with updated info
[2:45:51] <%SkellyVee> ida is the worst
[2:45:56] <%cvp5127> man fuck ida

[2:46:07] <+Sp3ctre48> yes
[2:46:10] <Bennett_Fracture> hey... punchmother dearest... get into fighting games...
[2:46:10] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[2:46:11] <%SouLucha> Most 2188 people are terrible.
[2:46:15] <Bennett_Fracture> for glorious fun...
[2:46:15] <+Sp3ctre48> along with Kengo Ogata
[2:46:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SpaceGuntank for an actual dinner, hamburg. for a snack, yakisoba pan
[2:46:18] <%SkellyVee> yep and ogatas dad
[2:46:20] <+richardlikespies> get rida of Ida
[2:46:22] <Iphantom99> oh wait Ida getting forgiven was the actual biggest flaw I forgot
[2:46:24] <%cvp5127> ida the giga simp
[2:46:27] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:46:30] <brachydios777> Fucked but smart
[2:46:32] <alphalejandro> He was the true villian all along
[2:46:33] <thesilverbard> as a baby
[2:46:33] <%SouLucha> Morimura is the worst.
[2:46:38] <%baka_sugoi> IDA SIGMA SIMP
[2:46:39] <%Amaideus> WHICH ONE
[2:46:41] <%Amaideus> THERE'S LIKE 4
[2:46:50] <%SouLucha> 2188 Morimura is the worst.
[2:46:52] <%Amaideus> (It's obviously granny)
[2:47:04] <soul_survive> basically a lot of the 2188 crew did some fucked shit
[2:47:04] <LycheeMusings> 2188 is basically wanna be dictator
[2:47:11] <pixel_river> 1 guy
[2:47:14] <cumurasame> wait did Woolie finish it a few hours ago
[2:47:15] <%Drunkengen> KENGO AINT IMPORTANT
[2:47:15] <+jiggy_snipe> Kengo was gonna still Nenji's body
[2:47:18] <%SouLucha> But 2188 Mori did the worst.
[2:47:19] <CaptainBright> the F I N A L G U Y
[2:47:20] <%cvp5127> pltpoints were dropped due to time
[2:47:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> survive
[2:47:27] <sketchpixels> Ida really does look like sigma from (ATD)
[2:47:28] <+Zasne> Kengo isn't important
[2:47:29] <CaptainBright> aka he fucked over the earth
[2:47:30] <%SkellyVee> he wanted to grow ogata to take him over
[2:47:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Kengo has ZERO influence LUL
[2:47:34] <brachydios777> What was the point of Kengo?
[2:47:34] <%Livelinne> woolieONEGUY woolieLORE
[2:47:37] <OblivionSword1> Objective : SURVIVE
[2:47:38] <+JacknZack27> He’s just an asshole
[2:47:39] <rosemon5001> Kengo is PowerUpL TheIlluminati PowerUpR guy....
[2:47:39] <%SkellyVee> ye
[2:47:41] <%SkellyVee> YES
[2:47:43] <CappuccinoGuil> He wanted to be young and hot
[2:47:43] <+richardlikespies> like 2188 megumi, natsuno, miura, and okina seem like the only ok one
[2:47:45] <heartlesshealer> Kengo was just ruler selfishness
[2:47:46] <reonome> yes
[2:47:46] <pixel_river> yes
[2:47:49] <%Amaideus> He's like an evil macguffin
[2:47:49] <%SkellyVee> YEP
[2:47:50] <%Drunkengen> KENGO IS ONE GUY
[2:47:53] <LycheeMusings> Danaerys "2188 Morimura" Targaryen
[2:47:54] <+jiggy_snipe> Snatcher Kengo Kappa
[2:47:56] <+Sp3ctre48> He's not really important in the grand scheme of things, just who Morimura was listening to concerning the plan
[2:47:56] <%SouLucha> Kengo is just a evil AI by the time Morimura fucked Earth over.
[2:47:58] <%Amaideus> He just exists to explain why certain actions were taken
[2:47:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I don't think he made it onto the pod though, gouto stopped him i think?
[2:47:59] <%gatorafan> Turns out Palpatine wasn't important after all huh? Kappa
[2:48:01] <sketchpixels> CYBERPUNK 2077
[2:48:06] <Iphantom99> I think Morimura had to activate Kengo and just dumpstered him when she lost the bet
[2:48:07] <corinv> Kengo was the only reason Project Ark got funded in the first place, he basically put Prof Morimura on her path to ending humanity accidentally
[2:48:07] <%dkzk21> Kengo and Morimura both didnt hit the age for the memory overwrite. They left the pods before that was supposed to happen.
[2:48:13] <+JacknZack27> But they got out early so now hes fucked
[2:48:24] <%wibbwobbler> clones r cool lol
[2:48:26] <BanquoViaquo> @KeroKamina god I love how poetic that is for kid Ogata
[2:48:33] <rosemon5001> @KeroKamina all according to cake
[2:48:35] <%Lion_kun> She's not Mori 88, she's lolimura
[2:48:36] <+justianxix> Im already half Kengo
[2:48:38] <+skyheys> probably why nenji has the d code
[2:48:40] <%SouLucha> Kengo was just a dumb AI making evil plans, while Mori actually did it..
[2:48:48] <thesilverbard> since they got out before they turned 18, Kengo is stuck as harmless data in sector 0
[2:48:48] <+TinyKing> almost everyone from 2188 is "the villain"
[2:48:48] <LycheeMusings> @KeroKamina YO NENJI GOT NORTED
[2:48:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Kengo's influence in the story is so little, dude isn't IN the simulation LUL
[2:49:02] <%osaka_daioh> Yeah, exactly
[2:49:03] <+Unajer> indistinguishable from the real deal
[2:49:05] <%Weeewer> Miwako is real <3
[2:49:08] <mortificent> AI RIGHTA?
[2:49:09] <+richardlikespies> woolie ends ai racism
[2:49:10] <penitentpendant> 13 Sentinels 2: Humans vs AIs
[2:49:11] <reonome> they're all not real because they're videogame characters Kappa
[2:49:11] <+0ni0n_L0rd> MIWAKO IS REAL
[2:49:11] <EndgameContent> Anything that is ostensibly real is real
[2:49:17] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:49:18] <T_Sasquatch> nope
[2:49:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @cappuccinoguil omg he didnt even make it in pffft
[2:49:18] <%osaka_daioh> Miwako is real, yeah.
[2:49:19] <brachydios777> Kengo could be written out and little would change
[2:49:20] <%Lion_kun> Miwko'a thiccness is real.
[2:49:20] <T_Sasquatch> no they arent
[2:49:24] <Lancaster_H> look if a clone of me shows up im shooting
[2:49:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:49:25] <mortificent> Transhumanism?
[2:49:25] <%RyTYoung> MIWAKO IS SOPER REAL
[2:49:25] <sketchpixels> MIWAKO IS FAKE
[2:49:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait chat did kengo even stay on the probes or nah?
[2:49:28] <+JacknZack27> Yes they are
[2:49:28] <+richardlikespies> MIWAKO'S REALER THAN US
[2:49:29] <%Lion_kun> Miwako's thicness is real
[2:49:30] <%SkellyVee> waoSweat waoSweat
[2:49:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Okay Woolie, then go shoot Miwako if clones and AI aren't real in this Kappa
[2:49:31] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @KeroKamina
[2:49:31] <T_Sasquatch> we should enslave robots and ai
[2:49:32] <%Livelinne> Hooman rights papifuPower
[2:49:33] <%Amaideus> It's not worth making clones if you're gonna treat them as real people in like, 99% of scenarios
[2:49:34] <%osaka_daioh> Miwako~
[2:49:37] <irfan_> the end gave me massive Soma vibes which was great
[2:49:38] <+skyheys> OKAY MR CHEMICALS
[2:49:39] <%baka_sugoi> +R
[2:49:41] <Equirah> yoooooo, punchmom on stream!
[2:49:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @SuckerPunchSyd NOT EVEN AS A CROWD NPC LUL
[2:49:52] <%Livelinne> joofbSip joofbSip joofbSip
[2:50:01] <soul_survive> miwako more real than kengo Kappa
[2:50:06] <arkv01> R's so hard they become an L
[2:50:12] <+Sp3ctre48> Kengo is technically in the simulation, just as data in sector 0 just like Professor Morimura was before Nurse Morimura accidentally downloaded her into kid Chihiro
[2:50:21] <%Seancicle> 🤚🏻motion for a recess
[2:50:21] <%JustToWatch> ok but if this game wanted to have a REAL stinger, a fucking worldship would warp into orbit and actual earthlings would come out like "actually, we lived bitch"
[2:50:23] <aiwass8> Morimura just lucky that she was downloaded into data-clone, Kengo just fucked
[2:50:38] <%Weeewer> Fuck Kengo
[2:50:38] <alphalejandro> AI granny
[2:50:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Kengo: wants to live again, Fails at every turn
[2:50:42] <%Weeewer> He’s the One Guy
[2:50:45] <+Jaromero435> Reggie no D:
[2:50:46] <CappuccinoGuil> This Tamao is too pure TearGlove TearGlove TearGlove
[2:50:49] <Althallos> @sketchpixels What's ATD?
[2:50:51] <brachydios777> A+ to the translators also
[2:50:55] <+justianxix> The FINAL guy
[2:50:57] <%cvp5127> man tamao get shafted
[2:51:05] <Lancaster_H> reminder that 2025 izumi and megumi were already in love
[2:51:09] <%Drunkengen> Tomi?
[2:51:10] <arkv01> this dub really made the game more enjoyable
[2:51:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Yo, Chat, question: Tamao in 80s outfit or 40s outfit?
[2:51:13] <%dkzk21> @justtowatch Now that's the sequel nobody asked for.
[2:51:14] <+Zasne> No, Izumi figured it all out.
[2:51:16] <Iphantom99> Tamao route on the cutting room floor somewhere
[2:51:18] <+BigCoffee> @CappuccinoGuil Yes
[2:51:19] <heartlesshealer> BOL during 2025 battle would have overwritten the Juro data, I guess?
[2:51:19] <%SouLucha> @Sp3ctre48 Not even, Kengo was likely deleted by 88 Gotou the time the project lanched.
[2:51:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil 80s
[2:51:24] <+Jaromero435> 426?
[2:51:25] <%Amaideus> I like 80's more
[2:51:26] <pixel_river> Is it supposed to be Izumi and chihiro on the boxart and not Ioiri and Kurabe then?
[2:51:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil My man
[2:51:28] <Althallos> @CappuccinoGuil 80s
[2:51:28] <alphalejandro> Kengo doesn't matter
[2:51:29] <brachydios777> 80s have the shorter skirt
[2:51:29] <DubiousRhino> Space Tomi I think was the only one that had every piece of information
[2:51:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Gouto, Mori 88, Okino, Izumi, Inaba
[2:51:40] <%CreggaMonsta> HeyGuys
[2:51:46] <Althallos> @sketchpixels ahh
[2:51:49] <%takutoots> they have to break the code loop
[2:51:53] <cizal11> You have such a fundamental misunderstanding about juro and megumi. Juro liked her pretty much the whole time, it was only because of Izumis memories that he pushed her away cuz he literally thought he was gonna murder her
[2:51:54] <HeroToxiko> a MATRIX
[2:52:04] <alephalpha> FUCKING RYOKO
[2:52:07] <%Weeewer> YES
[2:52:09] <%slayabee> Yes
[2:52:09] <%osaka_daioh> Yes
[2:52:09] <+Zasne> Izumi figured it all out. He became Neo+Mr Smith.
[2:52:09] <arkv01> I come from the net
[2:52:11] <%SouLucha> YES
[2:52:12] <corinv> Yuup
[2:52:12] <%Weeewer> they get deconstructed
[2:52:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @brachydios777 the 80s version has knee length, though. 40s has some nice pants. I like the blouse
[2:52:13] <Arancet> they die in the pods and are recreated
[2:52:14] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:52:15] <brachydios777> Yes
[2:52:16] <CaptainBright> yes, they do die
[2:52:17] <%Drunkengen> @woolieversus SO ARE YOU SAYING THE VIDEO GAME IS THE VIDEO GAME?
[2:52:17] <+Unajer> keep reading
[2:52:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gooped
[2:52:19] <%cvp5127> recycled
[2:52:19] <%slayabee> Go check the loop page and be fucked up
[2:52:20] <%SkellyVee> every loop, the nano machines kill them every reset
[2:52:23] <Mayachacha> nooo i just joined
[2:52:26] <Mayachacha> did they finish it????
[2:52:29] <reonome> yes
[2:52:30] <+Sp3ctre48> yes
[2:52:32] <%ZweihanderSteve> yes
[2:52:32] <verscoll> yup
[2:52:33] <Lancaster_H> yeah
[2:52:33] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yes
[2:52:33] <pixel_river> yes
[2:52:34] <%Weeewer> @mayachacha yess
[2:52:38] <+richardlikespies> Is woolie gonna read the spoiler interview later?
[2:52:39] <%takutoots> whoa
[2:52:39] <brachydios777> @cappuccinoguil The 40s one does look nice
[2:52:39] <SideChar> they finish
[2:52:41] <Mayachacha> damn
[2:52:41] <+JacknZack27> When it loops it kills everyone in the pod
[2:52:42] <pixel_river> infinite loop
[2:52:48] <Mayachacha> ah well gonna rewatch tomorrow
[2:52:48] <bear_breaker20> The Game
[2:52:54] <+jiggy_snipe> you have to wake up pretty much
[2:52:56] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sketchpixels
[2:52:56] <%SouLucha> It's considered a failed loop, failed human.
[2:52:56] <%AndrewRoivas> Inaba had to send out the UC patch.
[2:52:57] <%Miles_Hikari> I really want Woolie to ead that interview. Its vital IMO
[2:53:01] <HeroToxiko> You can [not] redo
[2:53:05] <%Weeewer> You have to survive to 18, but in the story they broke out early
[2:53:12] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis
[2:53:13] <arkv01> all those dead pinocchios
[2:53:13] <heartlesshealer> If success, then memory download. If fail, recycle empty body
[2:53:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I think UC pulls the plug and puts you in hibernation at the last second, unless it loops
[2:53:28] <+skyheys> it has to be everyone, hence the UC salvaging Tamao and Okino
[2:53:28] <aiwass8> Bodies dissolved by nanomachines
[2:53:30] <pixel_river> yes
[2:53:40] <heartlesshealer> WOOLIE Look at the IMAGE for the Loop entry!
[2:53:41] <%Weeewer> Compatibility == Having a physical body
[2:53:42] <Arancet> that was unintended, but yes
[2:53:45] <+Sp3ctre48> It's kinda crazy that the only way they won was a series of bizarre coincidences that ended with an AI being accidentally transferred to the command ship where she was in a position to change things
[2:53:45] <%osaka_daioh> It is
[2:53:45] <+Zasne> yup
[2:53:46] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Hmmhmmm
[2:53:47] <+Buffalo36> correct LUL
[2:53:47] <rosemon5001> @sketchpixels not really if its fully liquified
[2:53:48] <%SkellyVee> Bodies are dissolved by nanomachines every loop reset
[2:53:50] <%slayabee> It gets worse
[2:53:50] <alphalejandro> You're not allow ot become a real boy, you stuck in Pinocchio mode
[2:53:57] <%osaka_daioh> Even if it's not fake world it's real memories
[2:54:00] <brachydios777> It’s still surviving as data either way with sector 0

[2:54:02] <pixel_river> thats some ghost in the shell stuff
[2:54:05] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Dragon4234
[2:54:05] <corinv> Did they ever actually pick up that the pods specifically is why they're nude in the sentinels? And also why Ms Morimura was inexplicably clothed when we saw her in one
[2:54:07] <%SouLucha> Feed the failed baby to next one!

[2:57:58] <pixel_river> the loop version of characters confuse me alot
[2:58:04] <%SouLucha> Too make it go according to her and Kengo's plan.
[2:58:04] <%Aceofstaves> @bear_breaker20 I bought and played it months ago, then imported the soundtrack from Japan
[2:58:04] <MyNameIsRasus> She wanted to basically reset and remove the Ryoko out of the system I think
[2:58:05] <%takutoots> another loop without Kaiju and get her own body
[2:58:06] <%Weeewer> Yeah that seems right
[2:58:09] <%Amaideus> @CazadorDeWulf Because he saw Nenji and Natsuno reacting to a Kaiju dropping
[2:58:13] <Psyramics> she wanted another loop so she could fix the kaiju problem at the source
[2:58:18] <+JacknZack27> A loop without kaiju
[2:58:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> she cancelled the d code so next loop all would go to plan
[2:58:20] <Althallos> @bear_breaker20 Already had it Day 1
[2:58:23] <+Sp3ctre48> She thought this loop was fucked and wanted another one so she could transfer herself into the new Morimura's body
[2:58:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @corinv oh, okay, gotcha
[2:58:29] <+DontMindMee> so the true heroes were those from loop 298
[2:58:31] <alephalpha> a loop without kaiju
[2:58:34] <%Amaideus> And that's already happened, and it's happening in what looks like the same place, so it MUST be happening on this planet @CazadorDeWulf
[2:58:34] <Where_U_Bin_Laden> 4800 years of loops
[2:58:38] <CappuccinoGuil> I was about to point Hip-Breaker Reggie towards that info LUL
[2:58:42] <HeroToxiko> so this was like looper where we actually start several loops in, cool
[2:58:49] <%takutoots> reminds me of endless summer in HS
[2:58:51] <%Amaideus> 3000+ loops in, yes
[2:58:51] <Psyramics> miWACKO
[2:58:53] <brachydios777> What about the 4 loop limit?
[2:58:54] <heartlesshealer> two of the same AI
[2:58:56] <%SouLucha> What Lolimura didn't know is that Sector 0 was going to fail.
[2:59:06] <rosemon5001> Infinite Dead Baby Works by Type moon
[2:59:06] <pixel_river> she got patched
[2:59:22] <+Sp3ctre48> The story is basically the last 3 loops, when discovering sector 0 pretty much changed everything for them
[2:59:25] <%Amaideus> GrannyMura doesn't care about the sector 0 reset
[2:59:25] <%Livelinne> clempsSad
[2:59:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @pixel_river UC patched out an item dupe glitch
[2:59:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SouLucha doesn't matter, mori 88 is hard coded in, so 0 resetting would be fine
[2:59:31] <%Amaideus> Her code is baseline as part of the program
[2:59:32] <Arancet> @brachydios777 it wasnt a limit of 4, it was a limit of 300-something, they just didnt know they had already gone through them all
[2:59:33] <irfan_> 1985 tamao is the only example of an AI being erased because the real human version exists

[3:04:24] <+jiggy_snipe> tbf humanity killed themselves when they are going extinct
[3:04:25] <+skyheys> you cant blame it all on her when everyone fucked it up.
[3:04:26] <DubiousRhino> the 15 people on the colony all killed each other and she said "okay never again"
[3:04:28] <%Amaideus> It's pretty much that simple
[3:04:29] <alphalejandro> Yes, Ida was the trigger for Ryoko's gun

[3:07:28] <%Amaideus> @SouLucha What's that a reference to, i know i know it
[3:07:29] <HeroToxiko> I the last man
[3:07:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, use your words
[3:07:30] <%Livelinne> HETS ARE NOT ALRIGHT shiaHypers
[3:07:31] <Lancaster_H> literally two people left with nothing to save
[3:07:32] <quietshun> It's pretty understandable in that situation
[3:07:33] <+jiggy_snipe> 15 people left and 13 of them kill each other
[3:07:34] <+Zasne> well thats you Woolie
[3:07:35] <%Weeewer> She’s the last human in a colony of HYPOCRITES
[3:07:35] <Blank9> she was the LAST ONE
[3:07:37] <Lancaster_H> fuck off you disagree
[3:07:38] <+jiggy_snipe> humanity is fucked dude
[3:07:38] <%great_tj> They were the last 2
[3:07:40] <heartlesshealer> But if he weren't dead, he would have stopped her
[3:07:42] <morningmoondude> If she was the last one then that means Ida killed himself first just to not die WITH her.
[3:07:43] <%RamenPoweredEmo> what about child megumi
[3:07:44] <Blank9> literally not if she was the last woman alive
[3:07:44] <+NeonLight> In the end, all of these character were human, and acted like people
[3:07:46] <quietshun> what's worth living for if nobody else is left
[3:07:49] <+skyheys> the point was that he had no empathy
[3:07:51] <heartlesshealer> so he just went off alone and left her there
[3:07:52] <HeroToxiko> ida going his own way LUL
[3:07:52] <%SouLucha> @Amaideus Berserk
[3:07:55] <alephalpha> ida killed himself just to not fie with her
[3:07:56] <CappuccinoGuil> How many good people were there in 2188? Let's be real
[3:07:58] <alephalpha> which eyha
[3:08:00] <%Amaideus> Of course, my dumb ass
[3:08:01] <%Amaideus> Thanks
[3:08:01] <+Sp3ctre48> I mean, what else was left at that point? You don't have to agree with it but it's understandable why she would resort to that
[3:08:03] <alephalpha> ryoko is still amosnter
[3:08:09] <%Weeewer> Miura and Minami were the only good humans left
[3:08:10] <DatAsuna> yeah but that's you
[3:08:11] <%Kriss1827> @cappuccinoguil probably only child megumi
[3:08:15] <thesilverbard> It is not a situation conducive to rational thinking
[3:08:17] <%RamenPoweredEmo> So when did child megumi die was she in the shootout? or someting or was it just oof
[3:08:19] <+skyheys> Depression is a BITCH Woolie
[3:08:19] <+Zasne> literally the final human alive. thats not something you can apply your morals to
[3:08:20] <%Weeewer> And Megumi
[3:08:20] <%cvp5127> YES
[3:08:25] <+richardlikespies> megumi probably died
[3:08:26] <+fetrigon> DESPAIR
[3:08:26] <reonome> PRETTY MUCH
[3:08:27] <ZaiWolfgang> DANGANRONPA
[3:08:27] <+0neReeler> Griffith did no wrong
[3:08:28] <+jiggy_snipe> does humanity deserve to live if they are super shitty to the very end?
[3:08:29] <%Amaideus> It's still peak "fuck the future, I'm butthurt"
[3:08:32] <%doombawkzvs> Why do we live... JUST TO SUFFER?
[3:08:33] <CappuccinoGuil> @Kriss1827 did Miura and Natsuno do anything wrong, though? what about Okino and Hijiyama?
[3:08:33] <cizal11> Woolie she’s fully established as being kinda mentally unstable in general put it together
[3:08:33] <MyNameIsRasus> DANG OL GRANPAS
[3:08:37] <brachydios777> Kurabe was story decent too

[3:08:43] <Lancaster_H> nobody can comprehend this kinda thing by speculating and not living it
[3:08:45] <+BigCoffee> It was dying Woolie, life support exploded from EI's bomb
[3:08:46] <DatAsuna> "just"
[3:08:47] <brachydios777> *still decent
[3:08:51] <+Unajer> if you're the LAST person. what do you even do??
[3:08:52] <%Livelinne> shiaF shiaF
[3:08:55] <+fetrigon> PowerUpL DESPAIR PowerUpR
[3:08:56] <%wibbwobbler> that's definitely a mood right there lol
[3:08:56] <quietshun> She shouldn't have done the loop stuff, but it's still very understandable
[3:08:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Ain't it funny that the colony fell apart because of the old, rich and powerful :)
[3:09:00] <%Kriss1827> @cappuccinoguil hmm fair point
[3:09:01] <%Aceofstaves> @amaideus what future, the one depending on clones of hypocrites and murderers?
[3:09:06] <%demystify_fist> "i would simply just not be depressed" lol
[3:09:06] <%Amaideus> Yeah
[3:09:07] <alphalejandro> But to the point of ruin Humanity's last chance, c'mon Woolie
[3:09:11] <%Amaideus> Because clones aren't the same people
[3:09:13] <+0neReeler> humanity needs to feel this despair
[3:09:14] <%Amaideus> They're clones
[3:09:14] <%Irridium> basically, cool story still murder
[3:09:14] <rosemon5001> PowerUpL rosent1Poggokuma PowerUpR
[3:09:16] <%Weeewer> @aceofstaves wel said
[3:09:17] <+richardlikespies> we hopefully will never know this feeling fully
[3:09:21] <%Amaideus> Are twins the same people?
[3:09:25] <alephalpha> still infinite baby murder
[3:09:27] <%Amaideus> No, obviously not
[3:09:29] <Lancaster_H> @CappuccinoGuil colony also existed because of the rich and powerful, so ehhhh
[3:09:30] <irfan_> 2188 ida: "damn ryoko thats wack"
[3:09:33] <%Amaideus> So it's fucking DUMB
[3:09:33] <%cvp5127> thats you woolie tho
[3:09:35] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @reonome
[3:09:39] <+Sp3ctre48> I could tolerate being the last human alive cause I'm built different
[3:09:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Depression hits hard dude, people have killed themselves for way less
[3:09:44] <DatAsuna> Yeah YOU wouldn't
[3:09:48] <Lancaster_H> you dont know what the fuck you would do
[3:09:50] <brachydios777> @amaideus Genetically , not of mind and experience
[3:09:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @Lancaster_H An even more relevant point. Probably nothing we should worry about though :)
[3:09:51] <+skyheys> If you had 2 hours left youd want to die together
[3:09:52] <mass1997> ok fair
[3:09:53] <%Irridium> rip to you but Ida's different
[3:09:54] <%SouLucha> Yeah, it's fucked.
[3:09:55] <alephalpha> ok I've wnated to kill myself before but I've never wanted to do infinite baby urder forever
[3:09:55] <%SkellyVee> yeye
[3:09:56] <%Aceofstaves> @amaideus reminder that at least two of them already planned to steal their clones' bodies
[3:09:57] <heartlesshealer> 'kay
[3:10:04] <%Amaideus> Yeah
[3:10:04] <Blank9> She offered a suicide pact and he rejected AND killed himself alone
[3:10:06] <+jiggy_snipe> they were gonna die anyway I think
[3:10:08] <%Amaideus> And that's super unethical
[3:10:11] <%Aceofstaves> same people
[3:10:11] <irfan_> dont think you can put the blame on just one of them
[3:10:13] <Blank9> to leave her alone as the only human
[3:10:15] <DatAsuna> Empathise
[3:10:16] <CappuccinoGuil> The question is: are Ida's words the final push or salt to the wound?
[3:10:17] <%SkellyVee> lol
[3:10:19] <+jiggy_snipe> I think life support was destroyed by Ei
[3:10:19] <cizal11> Yeah but it’s not you, it’s her
[3:10:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just checking in. Game over and they're just reading what?
[3:10:23] <%Amaideus> It's nowhere near as unethical as "fuck all of humanity forever, genocide eternal"
[3:10:25] <arkv01> become US woolie
[3:10:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:10:25] <%Weeewer> Talk about the characters rationale, which you did!
[3:10:28] <+Zasne> it's much less a "pact" than you think. The two LAST humans who WILL die... she wanted to simply die simultaneously with her lover. And he hurt her badly.
[3:10:28] <%dkzk21> Woolie is just built different.
[3:10:31] <RacistWakka> Griffith DID NOTHING WRONG
[3:10:31] <HeroToxiko> built DIFFRENT
[3:10:32] <%Drunkengen> In the bottom line IDA IS THE BIG BAD
[3:10:32] <%great_tj> Reject Humanity Woolie
[3:10:32] <+Unajer> imagine being the last 2 people left ever, and they still fight. That would fuck with anyone.
[3:10:32] <%gatorafan> Why are you being you, when you could be me?
[3:10:34] <+skyheys> You're talking about someone else you goober :U
[3:10:34] <alphalejandro> that's YOUR opinion and that's fine
[3:10:35] <%JustToWatch> I would have simply cured the nanoplague, and this quandary would never have existed
[3:10:36] <Lancaster_H> no one can comprehend that shit
[3:10:41] <%SouLucha> Yeah, I couldn't agree to it. I'd just die depressed and alone.
[3:10:45] <reonome> ryoko did NOTHING wrong
[3:10:45] <+justianxix> Woolie wouldnt die with his girlfriend Guys
[3:10:46] <heartlesshealer> fall in love with Griffith
[3:10:48] <%great_tj> what if you could get a Jetpack though?!
[3:10:48] <+Sp3ctre48> Everyone fucked up, it's not just an individual person's fault, but yeah 2188 Ida was a monster
[3:10:51] <%SouLucha> No need to screw future humans.
[3:10:51] <DatAsuna> "If I were in the story I'd do it different"
[3:10:51] <RF_Zechs> If you think you're lonely now....
[3:10:52] <cizal11> ????
[3:10:55] <%Weeewer> Ei cut the power supply
[3:11:02] <%Weeewer> But he just wanted to kill Morimura
[3:11:06] <%Aceofstaves> what genocide?? she's the last human, the rest aren't even fetuses, they're a genome
[3:11:08] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Wait a minuet this is too deep, too deep
[3:11:09] <soul_survive> if I were on the colony I would have just handled it
[3:11:09] <%Amaideus> Also, does 2188 Shinonome even know about the body snatching?
[3:11:09] <reonome> ei was just doing his job
[3:11:10] <morningmoondude> Sorry, Shinonome, you can chug your pills but I simply won't succumb to the chemicals in my brain. I'm built different.
[3:11:11] <cizal11> Ei only directly killed morimura
[3:11:15] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RacistWakka
[3:11:17] <irfan_> Ei was an assassin that was hired to kill morimura specifically
[3:11:21] <rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus but the real question what happened to the real earth? destroyed by the sun or barren rock? after the probes left
[3:11:25] <Lancaster_H> sekigahara suicide bomb'd the colony
[3:11:25] <%Amaideus> Well that's just the abortion debate @Aceofstaves
[3:11:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, I thought Ryoko ALSO caused the end of humanity before the colony?
[3:11:29] <cizal11> The rest died indirectly from the life support being fucked
[3:11:30] <%SouLucha> Like just imagine how horrible it must have been in the final moments of the final human.
[3:11:30] <%Livelinne> Oh boi
[3:11:32] <%Amaideus> But those babies gonna get born
[3:11:33] <+jiggy_snipe> yes that's why she did it, cuz humanity was the worst to the very end
[3:11:36] <alephalpha> @Amaideus @Aceofstaves peopel are reffeirng to the infecte dprobes
[3:11:39] <%Amaideus> And they gonna get interrupted and Kaiju'd
[3:11:44] <reonome> @rosemon5001 humanity was wiped out by nanomachines so its just animals and plants left i guess
[3:11:50] <%Kriss1827> @cappuccinoguil no that was morimura i believe
[3:11:50] <heartlesshealer> @CappuccinoGuil no that was Morimura releasing innerlociters onto the blackmarket
[3:11:56] <+Sp3ctre48> Humanity on earth went extinct due to the nanomachine infection
[3:11:57] <Iphantom99> there was a shootout beside the Sekigahara thing
[3:11:57] <LycheeMusings> OOF OF THE MILLENIUM
[3:12:00] <corinv> I had literally only one question by the end of finishing this game: why the fuck did everyone else agree to make a clone of Ei, when he was only there to kill one of the other 14?
[3:12:00] <%Amaideus> So she's directly responsible for all of those deaths, even if you don't include the AI ones
[3:12:02] <%Aceofstaves> yeah but I bet you don't think abortion clinics engage in genocide
[3:12:08] <%SouLucha> Everyone you knew died horrible, the space station you're on is failing.
[3:12:14] <brachydios777> Would Earth recover in 20 million years?
[3:12:16] <%Amaideus> I genuinely don't care either way
[3:12:18] <%Weeewer> Please rewatch the Ida Hypocrisy event. It really sheds a light on why he said something so shitty to Ryoko
[3:12:19] <+JustBlubs> You either suicide, or die painfully when everything in the space station starts breaking down.
[3:12:21] <mortificent> I for,
[3:12:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @Kriss1827 Oh shit, that's why I was confused, I mixed the world ending causers
[3:12:22] <penitentpendant> Work until the end
[3:12:22] <+ryujinran> Hijiyama 2088 mentions that ryoko and ida escaped from the shootout together
[3:12:22] <Blank9> it's a space station with no power, you're dead
[3:12:22] <%Amaideus> It's not my problem or my choice
[3:12:24] <%SouLucha> And most of those last humans were terrible shits.
[3:12:26] <Lancaster_H> life support is gone, youre gonna die no matter what
[3:12:28] <+Zasne> yes, they were 100% going to die
[3:12:34] <mortificent> If I die, I'll take some with me
[3:12:35] <+jiggy_snipe> you were gonna die soon
[3:12:36] <reonome> @brachydios777 humans were the true virus
[3:12:37] <MyNameIsRasus> You're the last person left and there's a clock ticking down on your death
[3:12:40] <heartlesshealer> @CappuccinoGuil it's fine, that's what discussion is for
[3:12:41] <%SouLucha> The worst of the worst was the last of the humans.
[3:12:55] <%wibbwobbler> suicide isn't really an option in my mind i guess
[3:12:56] <DatAsuna> suffocation/starvation/dehydration/burning .etc are all deaths that drive people to commit suicide instead
[3:12:57] <%SouLucha> Most killed each other just to live a bit MORE.
[3:12:58] <+Sp3ctre48> @corinv No one besides Gouto knew he was an assassin until that point, he was just one of the 15 survivors before then
[3:12:58] <T_Sasquatch> i would prefer not to be literally eaten alive so might as well murder a few zombies for the thrill , get bitten and peace out
[3:12:59] <+jiggy_snipe> not on Earth, on a colony
[3:13:01] <RacistWakka> We're getting philosophical here
[3:13:03] <%Amaideus> And there's a difference between "this potential baby is getting aborted" and "all of humanity forever is gonna get killed at the age of 16 for the rest of time in infinite amounts"
[3:13:05] <MyNameIsRasus> That Ryoko and Ida scene should have been in the game
[3:13:07] <+0neReeler> 5 days as the last human
[3:13:08] <VincentGraves> knowing when you will die fucks with you
[3:13:09] <%Amaideus> It's a completely different scope
[3:13:10] <%takutoots> I mean Ogata and Ei doomed the station
[3:13:16] <corinv> @corinv I guess that's fair actually, well played
[3:13:19] <+0ni0n_L0rd> The worst of the worst and a really shitty kid I guess
[3:13:20] <reonome> BLAT BLAT BLAT
[3:13:22] <Lancaster_H> Ei popped her, no?
[3:13:26] <Blank9> your crush killed themselves to leave you alone, after rejecting killing themselves together with you
[3:13:27] <heartlesshealer> Tamao would have been in the shootout for sure
[3:13:28] <%Weeewer> Yeah Ogata and Ei doomed everyone
[3:13:28] <%great_tj> A Space Sation thats on fire... theres so many terrible deaths just waiting to happen
[3:13:32] <%RamenPoweredEmo> child megumi i hope she didn't suffer :(
[3:13:34] <%Drunkengen> he blown up life support
[3:13:37] <%Weeewer> Morimura doomed them first
[3:13:43] <LycheeMusings> and Tamao goes SKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKRAAAAAAP
[3:13:44] <+0neReeler> gone in a blaze of glory
[3:13:48] <%SouLucha> Morimura doomed all Earth.
[3:13:58] <%cvp5127> everyone is gone tho
[3:14:01] <RacistWakka> I love how people want to take Ryoko responsibility
[3:14:02] <+Sp3ctre48> I assume Tamao would have been one of the people to die in the shootout
[3:14:12] <alphalejandro> Morimura doomed humanity, yeah was an accident, but still
[3:14:14] <heartlesshealer> Ei killed all the people working on projects I thought, so that would be tamao
[3:14:14] <MyNameIsRasus> People have killed themselves for way less
[3:14:16] <mortificent> Kengo and Morimura fucked humanity first
[3:14:19] <%Amaideus> I asked before and I think I saw someone answer but I missed it, did 2188 Ryoko know about the body snatching plot?
[3:14:26] <+Sp3ctre48> No
[3:14:27] <%cvp5127> its a lot of ppl fault
[3:14:29] <RacistWakka> OG Okino and Ryoko are to blame
[3:14:34] <%takutoots> Morimura/Kengo doomed humanity, Ei/Gyoto doomed the station, and Ryoko doomed new humanity
[3:14:35] <Iphantom99> Japan had Ryoko 1st in popularity and Morimura dead last so I guess we know who they blamed
[3:14:37] <corinv> 4 people died in the shootout total I think, 3 of which were Okino, Ogata, and Juro
[3:14:38] <%Amaideus> Okino because he was lazy
[3:14:40] <+0neReeler> if it's all for nothing
[3:14:45] <Blank9> izumi killed hijiyama's emotional support twink
[3:14:47] <%Amaideus> Ryoko because she brought in the enemy code too
[3:14:55] <+Sp3ctre48> I think it said 7 people died in the shootout
[3:15:01] <corinv> Oh 7? Damn
[3:15:01] <Lancaster_H> I cant understand woolie's arguing against the suicide of LITERALLY THE LAST HUMAN on a colony with a blown up life support
[3:15:13] <%takutoots> @Sp3ctre48 i believe so
[3:15:21] <RacistWakka> Okino and Ryoko are to blame
[3:15:23] <heartlesshealer> Oh right only 4 people.... so tamao might have been explosion death
[3:15:24] <%SouLucha> You're good Woolie.
[3:15:25] <xbb1024> Tamao was already very old in 2188, she probably would have died in the shootout or explosion
[3:15:25] <%Drunkengen> I wonder what happened to Juro and Megemi during the shoot out?
[3:15:27] <arkv01> GO OUT SWINGING
[3:15:28] <%Aceofstaves> for what? she's alone and doomed
[3:15:28] <+jiggy_snipe> @Lancaster_H especially after watching the last 15 people be pieces of shit to the end
[3:15:32] <+BlueJoneleth> @Lancaster_H upload your data to the system lol
[3:15:32] <brachydios777> Life support was fucked thanks to Ei, lets remember
[3:15:34] <+0neReeler> physical can heal, mental not really without help
[3:15:34] <%Weeewer> Morimura and Kengo are you blame
[3:15:34] <%great_tj> which is moments away
[3:15:35] <DatAsuna> I would do the same as you, I'm just not confused by people saying or doing otherwise.
[3:15:36] <pixel_river> i think id act different when the situation actually hits me
[3:15:39] <EndgameContent> Like what if something cool happens immediately after you die
[3:15:39] <+Sp3ctre48> Okino couldn't have possibly known this would happen
[3:15:39] <%Weeewer> But almost everyone fucked up
[3:15:42] <%Amaideus> What bad thing did Tamo 2188 even do?
[3:15:46] <%Aceofstaves> why prolong it at that point. there's literally no chance of cavalry
[3:15:48] <%Amaideus> She's sqeaky clean
[3:15:48] <Blank9> If you're suffocating and starving in pitch black, unregulated temperatures in space knowing you are the only human alive, you're not thinking
[3:15:49] <arkv01> last two people? we'll bang, okay?
[3:15:52] <corinv> It's 2188 so they probably had some really nice, clean medical ways to commit suicide, honestly
[3:15:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jiggy_snipe 14 maybe? I mean megumi was still a kid
[3:15:55] <%SouLucha> To be fair, Woolie you haven't been broken...
[3:15:55] <MyNameIsRasus> In a really painful way
[3:16:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Unless she was a really shitty kid on the colony’s
[3:16:01] <%SkellyVee> honestly either option is fucked lol
[3:16:04] <%takutoots> ultra despair
[3:16:04] <alphalejandro> Oh and Ida was an a-hole
[3:16:08] <%Weeewer> She was completely broken
[3:16:11] <+jiggy_snipe> @SuckerPunchSyd naw she was an evil kid probably Kappa
[3:16:14] <heartlesshealer> ryoko wanted quick end with other person instead of wasting away, Ida dumped her immediately
[3:16:16] <+Zasne> it's WAY more than that. Cause she wanted to die with her lover
[3:16:16] <+skyheys> The other person then tears you down savagely
[3:16:21] <%Drunkengen> MIND BREAK
[3:16:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Kappa
[3:16:24] <+Raspada_Ryner> I honestly can't fathom it unless it actually happens to me
[3:16:24] <+0neReeler> some people can say that but in the situation...
[3:16:25] <+richardlikespies> i need a prequel manga or novel
[3:16:27] <LycheeMusings> She got rejected even when there's only the two of them left
[3:16:29] <DatAsuna> 9/11, are you a burner or a window jumper?
[3:16:30] <%Weeewer> Man Reggie; well said!!
[3:16:31] <gamria> I pity and understand Ryoko, but I wouldn't suggest suicide. But then, would I suffer the horror of being sucked into outer space when the station breaks apart in a few hours
[3:16:31] <morningmoondude> the big thing is that Ida DID give up, just not with Shinonome specifically.
[3:16:33] <%SouLucha> MY MIIND, AUGH MY HEAD
[3:16:35] <%Amaideus> Tbh as long as there's enough food and I can sleep alright I'd live on until I died from whatever
[3:16:43] <+skyheys> Woolie HATES anesthesia! LUL
[3:16:44] <%SouLucha> Take your pills!!!
[3:16:51] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Reggie is a true king
[3:16:54] <RacistWakka> Ok Ryoko suicide is understandable. MURDERING KIDS ARENT
[3:17:00] <bear_breaker20> get fucked scrub is the message sent
[3:17:03] <%Amaideus> Murder loop!
[3:17:06] <%Amaideus> murder loop!
[3:17:12] <RacistWakka> Ryoko is still fucked up
[3:17:13] <irfan_> the current me wouldnt want to end my life myself, even if it means dying out slowly. theres no universal right answer
[3:17:17] <%Amaideus> Fuck all of humanity forever!
[3:17:18] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis
[3:17:19] <%SkellyVee> everything is a grey area
[3:17:24] <%Amaideus> ALL OF IT, EVEN THE INNOCENTS
[3:17:25] <%Aceofstaves> even if waiting it out means the death is far more painful than suicide?
[3:17:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:17:25] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Imagine you're stuck in one of the twin towers. Do you burn in the fire, or jump out of the window?
[3:17:31] <alephalpha> suicide suepr reasonable infinite murser forever not so much
[3:17:34] <%Miles_Hikari> That interview really adds so much more to this story man
[3:17:41] <corinv> Well we only argue about this because the infinite universal baby murder machine that came after isn't exactly easy to defend
[3:17:42] <BearSawed> If I have no agency in the situation at all, then the option is on the table
[3:17:46] <RacistWakka> Would you kill children out of spite?
[3:17:47] <Blank9> hey, humanity fucked an entire planet up and ended up with all the stuff leading to her being alone
[3:17:51] <Blank9> why bring them back
[3:17:52] <brachydios777> I wonder how Ryoko would have felt if she got uploaded to and got to meet the kids she is putting through hell
[3:17:56] <%Weeewer> She didn’t kill children in her mind
[3:17:57] <corinv> They're two separate conversations
[3:17:58] <+BlueJoneleth> @Miles_Hikari Hemborger!
[3:17:59] <+Zasne> can only be assumed she suicided. she mightve just died naturally
[3:18:00] <%takutoots> having a discussion at all really tells you the story really holds weight
[3:18:01] <Blank9> and the EXACT same people that 100% fucked up
[3:18:05] <mortificent> still doesn't justify the Infinite Genocide
[3:18:06] <%Weeewer> She probably didn’t know exactly how the Kaiju situation would play out
[3:18:07] <Iphantom99> Kamatani says they cut half the story holy shit LUL
[3:18:09] <+jiggy_snipe> should humanity really get more planets to mess up?
[3:18:15] <%Weeewer> She just knew it would end humanity
[3:18:16] <%Amaideus> How the fuck
[3:18:16] <Lancaster_H> @alphalejandro it's really reasonable from HER perspective, considering the last 15 people of humanity were all shit except Hijiyama maybe
[3:18:22] <%Amaideus> Do you cut half the story of a game this dense
[3:18:23] <+0neReeler> revengeance
[3:18:24] <%Amaideus> That's insane
[3:18:24] <pixel_river> yes ALOT of content got cut
[3:18:25] <gamria> You know, maybe this is why the Kaiju were set to appear when they turned 16, and not when they were babies: killing teenagers is better on her conscience
[3:18:27] <%SkellyVee> yeye
[3:18:27] <heartlesshealer> Proliferation of Probes
[3:18:28] <IndoorSitup> fug
[3:18:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> OK! Let's keep it movin
[3:18:38] <SideChar> you are also in a empty space colony probably
[3:18:40] <%Amaideus> # 21888 Tamao did nothing wrong
[3:18:44] <%Amaideus> 2188*
[3:18:46] <RacistWakka> Griffith had atough life doesn't justify the eclipse
[3:18:46] <Iphantom99> I guess at some point they wanted to show all the 2188 stuff
[3:18:58] <DatAsuna> century ships
[3:19:00] <corinv> Nobody is trying to justify her genociding people lol
[3:19:00] <%Weeewer> 2188 Tamao made Miwako so she’s a queen
[3:19:01] <arkv01> shouldn't we be shooting DNA payloads to other planets right now
[3:19:05] <corinv> We're talking about the suicide situation
[3:19:08] <brachydios777> Also the probes literally create a crisis on Infinite Earths
[3:19:10] <MyNameIsRasus> THEY DID
[3:19:11] <heartlesshealer> slime mold process expanding through space
[3:19:13] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yes!
[3:19:14] <%ZweihanderSteve> BETTER THAN NOTHING
[3:19:17] <%Livelinne> cor
[3:19:21] <Blank9> shinonome's not causing a genocide technically, humanity was already dead and she's preventing it from restarting
[3:19:24] <%Weeewer> Woolie didn’t understand the last event AT ALL
[3:19:24] <%cvp5127> humanity will never die out
[3:19:35] <CappuccinoGuil> This is gonna get into some Warhammer 40K shit LUL
[3:19:37] <+0neReeler> succeed too hard: griffith
[3:19:38] <heartlesshealer> @Weeewer Woolie flat-out IGNORED numbers
[3:19:39] <MyNameIsRasus> They made sure humanity would NEVER be a memory
[3:19:41] <+arknodem> just got here. what % are they at?
[3:19:41] <alphalejandro> @Lancaster_H No only him, also Natsuno, Miura and child Megumi
[3:19:42] <arkv01> the idea if it won't matter because only the descendants will ever meet
[3:19:42] <xbb1024> Those probes could be a problem for any receiving aliens
[3:19:44] <+JustBlubs> There'll be possibly endless humanities all starting from the same 15 across the vast expanse
[3:19:45] <%demystify_fist> a lot of stuff that was cut had to do with the kids relationships with each other
[3:19:45] <%Amaideus> There's 15 new kids every loop though @Blank9
[3:19:45] <%SouLucha> Griffith had a choice.
[3:19:47] <%slayabee> Woolie...
[3:19:51] <%Amaideus> So she's killing them every time
[3:19:59] <heartlesshealer> (RS13a🌎🌌) ....Probes Spread.....Million+ Parsecs away.... (????🌎🌌)
[3:20:02] <%Amaideus> New copies I should say
[3:20:06] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Why?
[3:20:06] <%Weeewer> Then you misunderstood
[3:20:08] <brachydios777> If it wasn’t for Ryoko, Humanity would be everywhere in the universe at that point
[3:20:10] <%takutoots> wide as net as possible
[3:20:15] <+Raspada_Ryner> Imagine all these human-inhabited planets all having their origins from the same 15 people. They would be considered gods.
[3:20:17] <+richardlikespies> in a way, humanity kind of becomes an evil alien threat since they terraform the planet without any consideration to native species
[3:20:22] <%SkellyVee> yeyeyeyeye
[3:20:23] <arkv01> not random directions, probably systems with probable compatible planets
[3:20:24] <%SkellyVee> YEYEYEYE
[3:20:25] <%SouLucha> That's what it comes down to, Ryoko had a choice too, made at the worst possible time any human, the last human could do.
[3:20:27] <DubiousRhino> Woolie coming through with the LORE
[3:20:29] <corinv> Yeyeyeye
[3:20:31] <+Zasne> yup, there you go
[3:20:31] <Blank9> @Amaideus Taught by the info explicitly only created by those flawed people that couldn't even leave 15 people alive on a space station, let alone lead humanity.
[3:20:33] <%Weeewer> Yes
[3:20:33] <%Livelinne> @arknodem They technically finished. This is the post credit aftermath
[3:20:33] <%SkellyVee> yeyeyeyeyeyeyey
[3:20:34] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[3:20:35] <heartlesshealer> <3
[3:20:35] <ShepherdShang> correct
[3:20:37] <+Zasne> What-If Mode
[3:20:37] <+richardlikespies> ODIN SPHERE CANON
[3:20:38] <%JustToWatch> it's not a problem unless someone creates FTL travel
[3:20:38] <SideChar> thats right
[3:20:39] <%Miles_Hikari> There it is
[3:20:40] <%SouLucha> YEYEYEYEEY
[3:20:40] <+jiggy_snipe> naw he understands it
[3:20:49] <%osaka_daioh> yep
[3:20:52] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT HAS HAPPENED
[3:20:52] <heartlesshealer> it just super slime molded and succeeded too hard
[3:20:53] <+Zasne> All pairings are canon
[3:20:53] <%Weeewer> It IS happening
[3:20:53] <%Irridium> EVERY probe has to deal with it
[3:20:54] <+jiggy_snipe> A Crisis on Infinite Earths Kappa
[3:20:54] <%SkellyVee> it is happening cause of ryoko
[3:20:57] <+Sp3ctre48> Is happening in an infinite number of planets
[3:20:57] <%Amaideus> Yeah, the info curated specifically to prevent the same kind of events going down again
[3:20:58] <MyNameIsRasus> RYOKO KILLED INFINITE PEOPLE
[3:20:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the source was poisoned
[3:20:59] <r_xanadu> I want to see the possible sequel where one planet made from Project Ark meets with another one
[3:21:00] <+0neReeler> INFINITE
[3:21:00] <pixel_river> INFINITE PLANETS
[3:21:01] <RacistWakka> God the chat is annoying LOL
[3:21:02] <BanquoViaquo> It also neatly justifies the, like... 999 optional battles after this
[3:21:03] <alephalpha> @Blank9 so youc an see why in her state of mind she does it but she is 100% WRONG
[3:21:04] <IndoorSitup> YOUR FANFICS ARE NOW CANON
[3:21:05] <%wibbwobbler> ew
[3:21:06] <CappuccinoGuil> There are multiple 13 Sentinels happening
[3:21:08] <%AMUSERNAME> EVERY STAR IN THE SKY IS A 13 SENTINELS FANFIC Kappa
[3:21:09] <HeroToxiko> so its fucked everywhere
[3:21:10] <+arknodem> Nice. he came to the right conclusions.
[3:21:11] <cizal11> So it’s not even only 4500 dead kids
[3:21:13] <bear_breaker20> inversly there was no crisis overall
[3:21:16] <MyNameIsRasus> EVERY STAR IS AN AU
[3:21:18] <%Amaideus> INFINITE FANFIC WORKS
[3:21:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Each copy of the game is a probe!
[3:21:21] <%ZweihanderSteve> EVERYONES PLAYTHROUGH IS CANON
[3:21:22] <+Zasne> Correct
[3:21:23] <LycheeMusings> non-stop infinite Japanese Empire!!! BANZAI!!!!
[3:21:23] <%Weeewer> 13 Sentinels Extended Universe
[3:21:28] <IndoorSitup> ALL YOUR FANFICS ARE CANON
[3:21:30] <r_xanadu> Imagine: the First Contact in this series could involve a meeting with another version of humans
[3:21:30] <pixel_river> LUL LUL
[3:21:31] <mortificent> INFINITE GENOCIDE
[3:21:32] <%Livelinne> Their fuckery feeds our imagination and fanfics! shiaDingus
[3:21:33] <Blank9> @alephalpha That's if you assume cloning humanity is something that HAS to happen, after everything they did in this situation.
[3:21:36] <%Amaideus> It's 4500 kids X however many potential planets they found
[3:21:36] <+Zasne> too big? lmao
[3:21:37] <RacistWakka> INFINITE MURDER
[3:21:39] <cizal11> It’s potentially hundreds or thousands of chunks of 4500 or more dead kids
[3:21:40] <%gatorafan> Open Fanfiction,net
[3:21:42] <%baka_sugoi> BUT HOW MANY WILL SECEED
[3:21:43] <%takutoots> every variation of 15 are happening even with different people discovering Sector 0 first
[3:21:46] <KeroKamina> the reality where Nenji actually was in love wiht Natsuno
[3:21:50] <%SouLucha> Thanks chat...
[3:21:53] <+Sp3ctre48> And unless they get super incredibly lucky like our probe did, the rest of those probes might just cycle endlessly until they give out
[3:21:53] <HeroToxiko> ryoko deservd the airlock
[3:21:53] <Blank9> You may as well just say humanity failed, just wait for aliens or self-replicating AI develop.
[3:21:55] <RacistWakka> Calm down chat
[3:21:55] <%Amaideus> And that's assuming each one breaks out within 3000 loops
[3:21:57] <%gatorafan> HOW MANY PEOPLE HAS MEGUMI SHOT?
[3:21:57] <aiwass8> Infinite INFINITE genocide
[3:22:01] <%takutoots> @baka_sugoi Indeed
[3:22:01] <alephalpha> @Blank9 you cna apply that logic to humanity now
[3:22:02] <+0neReeler> jump to the end
[3:22:04] <%SuckerPunchSyd> At least 4500 kids dead
[3:22:05] <pixel_river> plot twitst even after game endLUL
[3:22:08] <%SkellyVee> maybeeeeeeeeeeee?
[3:22:13] <+fetrigon> all your game overs were real NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:22:14] <%Irridium> hopefully
[3:22:15] <Blank9> Humanity now's still alive. And didn't destroy the planet.
[3:22:15] <Lancaster_H> universe is a fuck
[3:22:16] <%Amaideus> @gatorafan Like, howevermany it was in this? So 13ish?
[3:22:18] <heartlesshealer> Megumi mercs millions
[3:22:24] <+Unajer> it's possible but there is a time limit. keep reading
[3:22:28] <+NemuiNemu> All relationships are cannon.
[3:22:30] <%cvp5127> infinite miwakos
[3:22:32] <%SouLucha> Woolie, the title says it all.
[3:22:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @gatorafan feels like it was something specific to this probe, considering fluffy is a Juro Izumi from 2 loops ago
[3:22:35] <%Amaideus> That only happens because of loop fuckery
[3:22:36] <pixel_river> Yeah the probes multiply
[3:22:39] <+0neReeler> ryoko just implemented a filter
[3:22:41] <+jiggy_snipe> literally infinite
[3:22:42] <%Livelinne> Aaaaaaaa kyoryuSHOOK
[3:22:42] <%Drunkengen> WAI DOESNT THAT MEAN THERES POSSIBLY INFINITY OF THE SAME YOU?
[3:22:43] <r_xanadu> were the probes launched after Ryoko made the D-Code?
[3:22:46] <IndoorSitup> Infinite monkeys on typewriters will eventually write the complete works pf Shakespeare
[3:22:46] <RacistWakka> Hmmm time to read the archives
[3:22:49] <brachydios777> They would have og Morimura also
[3:22:50] <+Sp3ctre48> Well they have 300 loops to try, after that when Sector 0 falls apart they're gonna be stuck forever
[3:22:55] <%Weeewer> I don’t think they get infinite loops at least, the facilities break down and run out of resources
[3:23:03] <%SkellyVee> ^
[3:23:04] <gamria> The condition is that if they discover Sector 0 within 5000 years, victory is possible
[3:23:05] <+Unajer> ya, they don't
[3:23:07] <heartlesshealer> oh god, Ryoko DID just put in a filter and that was it NotLikeThis
[3:23:07] <+jiggy_snipe> I assume some facilities failed
[3:23:08] <HeroToxiko> if only the base code was a happy game, infinite damashi deaths LuL
[3:23:09] <%Irridium> yeah the facilities can only sustain themselves for so long
[3:23:11] <%takutoots> remeber the closest was 12 years but I think the one 12,00 light years appears to be the first to succed
[3:23:13] <pixel_river> NotLikeThis
[3:23:13] <MyNameIsRasus> They'll get to that part
[3:23:14] <Iphantom99> there are probably some planets where Kengo and Ogata are the rulers too
[3:23:15] <%Amaideus> @Sp3ctre48 Nah, the sector 0 breakdown is just it not keeping the data from past loops and going back to the default
[3:23:19] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn MY MIND
[3:23:20] <reonome> they don't have infinite loops but they basically have infinite probes
[3:23:22] <RacistWakka> Keep reading
[3:23:26] <Iphantom99> oops Kengo and Morimura*
[3:23:27] <%Amaideus> It's like hard resetting your hard drive or something
[3:23:29] <OblivionSword1> at some point maybe
[3:23:30] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @halfmasks
[3:23:34] <ShepherdShang> Infinite wonder also brings infinite horro
[3:23:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @amaideus so its like a super reset?
[3:23:36] <pixel_river> the game is about robots right??
[3:23:38] <%Amaideus> You're back to the factory default at that point
[3:23:40] <KeroKamina> Martian Sucessor Nadesico
[3:23:43] <%wibbwobbler> a kaiju?!
[3:23:44] <jubejube56> This is basically the spoilercast
[3:23:47] <KeroKamina> Gundam AGE
[3:23:49] <%Amaideus> Pretty much @SuckerPunchSyd
[3:23:49] <HeroToxiko> The League Of Darkness
[3:23:49] <IndoorSitup> That would be WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY later in the future
[3:23:54] <RacistWakka> YOUR FANFICS ARE CANON
[3:24:05] <LycheeMusings> @KeroKamina basically
[3:24:06] <+0neReeler> why didn't they drop a probe back on og Earth?
[3:24:06] <+Sp3ctre48> @Amaideus I mean, the only way our group succeeded was because of Sector 0, if it breaks down, I can't imagine how else they would be able to escape
[3:24:06] <%Livelinne> Yay.
[3:24:09] <T_Sasquatch> ALL CAPS
[3:24:13] <%Drunkengen> So theres MANY LEAGUE OF DARKNESSES
[3:24:19] <pixel_river> Uase probes to make your fan fiction real
[3:24:21] <heartlesshealer> all fics canon oh boy
[3:24:22] <%Lion_kun> this is best planet
[3:24:22] <MyNameIsRasus> LEAGUE OF DARKNESS
[3:24:23] <+jiggy_snipe> sure
[3:24:24] <Blank9> I mean, the planet we're following is 20 million years in the future, that's pretty ridiculous too
[3:24:25] <%cvp5127> YEYEYE
[3:24:25] <%JustToWatch> ok but why not just do this for earth though
[3:24:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[3:24:26] <RacistWakka> Every single fanfic is Canon
[3:24:26] <%Subtlevictory> its the earlist one
[3:24:26] <Haarute> meanwhile, 14 SENTINELS
[3:24:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[3:24:27] <+Jaromero435> YEAH
[3:24:27] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Well...no
[3:24:27] <reonome> woolie pls
[3:24:27] <+skyheys> BIG TIDDY SHU AU
[3:24:28] <Iphantom99> truth
[3:24:29] <+0ni0n_L0rd> But
[3:24:30] <%baka_sugoi> MIWAKO
[3:24:30] <%Weeewer> YEAH CANON
[3:24:31] <+Zasne> I mean, IDK about that far, but sure
[3:24:31] <+arknodem> Infinite "Meanwhile...."
[3:24:32] <Alzero83> alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako
[3:24:32] <+jiggy_snipe> The AI broke out and saved everyone
[3:24:34] <%Amaideus> Is there a point somewhere saying that sector 0 is breaking down and not being repaired?
[3:24:36] <sketchpixels> MANKIND HAS CREATED ALIENS
[3:24:36] <Blank9> One of the other probes probably already succeeded on another planet at 19 million years
[3:24:36] <IndoorSitup> George Kamitani is a FUCKING GENIUS HOLY SHIT.
[3:24:37] <%Drunkengen> 15 SENTINELS
[3:24:45] <+richardlikespies> THE LOOP WITH WOOLIE EXISTS
[3:24:47] <KeroKamina> Miwako isn't real LUL
[3:24:55] <%Amaideus> Because my understanding is that it's resetting its saved data and repairing the physical thing to start the loops anew again afterwards
[3:24:55] <%Livelinne> woolieOMG
[3:24:56] <+justianxix> HUMANITY GUCK YEAH
[3:24:58] <arkv01> single points of failure
[3:25:00] <pixel_river> inifite miwakos across space
[3:25:00] <Kenyuki4> Miwako reverse Harem manga now!!
[3:25:01] <%ChoculaUltra> she's real to me :(
[3:25:07] <%takutoots> its literally the concept of conception
[3:25:10] <halfmasks> miwako isnt real, the 15 people are the only people who can be the main characters
[3:25:12] <T_Sasquatch> @caramel_coffin Because very few people know or care about this game
[3:25:12] <%Amaideus> It wouldn't have data from previous loops, but it'd start the baseline over again
[3:25:12] <r_xanadu> So, is this how God made the universe?
[3:25:17] <alphalejandro> a Miwako for everyone
[3:25:17] <%doombawkzvs> Miwako Experience Requiem
[3:25:18] <%cvp5127> one loop is a doujin woolieSMUG
[3:25:19] <IndoorSitup> George Kamitano is an absolute fucking genius.
[3:25:20] <%takutoots> *rather than metaphor
[3:25:22] <+arknodem> There is a universe with Tamao not eating shit every 10 seconds.
[3:25:23] <Alzero83> alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako alzeroMiwako
[3:25:28] <+JustBlubs> By the time they're able to meet up with the other humanities they'll be way different so it's fiiiiiiine
[3:25:30] <TukeArt> in one planet, Okino manages to disable the Kaijus and no battles happen, everything proceeds as planned. The boring planet
[3:25:33] <+Zasne> There are several constants
[3:25:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @halfmasks nuh uh my au says otherwise
[3:25:45] <%Aceofstaves> @r_xanadu Yes. George Kamitani is God and this is his memoir
[3:25:46] <RacistWakka> Has there ever been a reverse harem with a chubby protag?
[3:25:46] <+jiggy_snipe> there is a planet where Kengo comes back
[3:25:47] <+Sp3ctre48> @Amaideus They said this is the final loop they get before it breaks down, nothing about it being repaired. If they can't carry memories over then they have no defense against the cycles repeating
[3:25:49] <pixel_river> I think alot of people missed this extra ending, including reviwers
[3:25:49] <heartlesshealer> All probes are trying to guarantee to insure that at least one makes it. It's like planting an entire row of crops
[3:25:49] <+richardlikespies> are we the reapers?
[3:25:51] <+Raspada_Ryner> The origins of all humanity are Japanese people
[3:25:52] <+0neReeler> so we nature or nuture?
[3:25:54] <mortificent> Are we being punched by Gold Experience Requiem???
[3:25:55] <%Weeewer> This is more dangerous but more guaranyeed
[3:25:56] <IndoorSitup> Your favorite 13 Sentinels hentai doujins are now canon!
[3:25:57] <%Amaideus> Right
[3:25:59] <+Archphronimos> @WoolieVersus So, the ultimate question is "Does free will exist?" or is it all deterministic?
[3:26:03] <%Amaideus> But the cycles would repeat @Sp3ctre48
[3:26:08] <+crossing_mao> We live in a... several number of societies
[3:26:11] <Lancaster_H> I'm completely fine with infinite Morimuras
[3:26:12] <halfmasks> The 15 original people are the only possible Main Characters (remixed endlessly), everyone else is an AI construct.
[3:26:14] <%Drunkengen> What if the game gerne CHANGES INTO SOMETHING LIKE A FPS?
[3:26:14] <%Miles_Hikari> There's proabbly a reality where Miwako builds herself a personal harem
[3:26:20] <%Irridium> so many Morimuras
[3:26:21] <%Amaideus> The breakdown only matters for the people from this loop and before
[3:26:24] <+Unajer> it would be basically impossible for them to meet up with each other.
[3:26:32] <%Livelinne> The fanfic thicckens
[3:26:32] <+jiggy_snipe> I hope there are 2 planets within the same solor system that got terraformed
[3:26:39] <%Amaideus> It doesn't matter for Morimura 2188 for example, because she's part of the baseline
[3:26:40] <%baka_sugoi> GIVE US THE SNYDER CUT
[3:26:42] <heartlesshealer> We might end up with the Star Trek version of humanoid alien diversity
[3:26:44] <%cvp5127> theyre lightyears apart
[3:26:45] <%Amaideus> Hence why she was fine either way
[3:26:46] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jiggy_snipe god that would be rad
[3:26:49] <%Weeewer> We could get a wild sequel
[3:26:52] <arkv01> in my AU yuki chan is the one trying to put on a show for shu
[3:26:52] <%takutoots> actually
[3:26:53] <alephalpha> it's an arbitraty amount
[3:26:54] <%Weeewer> No the probes replicate
[3:26:54] <sendart> the probes replicate
[3:26:55] <+0neReeler> the solar systems are lightyears apart...
[3:26:56] <IndoorSitup> STAR TREK UNIVERSE
[3:26:58] <%Amaideus> The probes replicate forever
[3:26:59] <Iphantom99> they're so far from each other
[3:27:00] <arkv01> STD
[3:27:01] <+Unajer> but the probes keep making more of themselves
[3:27:01] <corinv> I think by the amount of time it would take for any of them to meet up, the events that created them would have been forgotten history
[3:27:02] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Hell yeah, let's get woke
[3:27:02] <+Zasne> Nope, they self-replicate. Infinite.
[3:27:03] <%Amaideus> So it's effectively infinite
[3:27:04] <%Weeewer> It’s basically infinite as long as there’s matter for them to mine
[3:27:04] <MyNameIsRasus> No, they replicate
[3:27:05] <caramel_coffin> What if were one of the probes that evolved over time Kappa
[3:27:05] <r_xanadu> Unfortunately, there is no version of this where Okino based the sim on something like Doom, so I can't have Miwako as the Doomslayer meeting with Miwako who is from the Animal Crossing Project Ark
[3:27:06] <%Kriss1827> probes replicate infinitely
[3:27:09] <pixel_river> Ryoko has corrupted so many probes
[3:27:09] <%wibbwobbler> until time stops i guess
[3:27:12] <%JustToWatch> finite but increasing exponentially
[3:27:13] <%doombawkzvs> The probes replicate so they're "practically" infinite
[3:27:17] <irfan_> they sent out a self replicating probe that theoretically should never totally die out
[3:27:17] <linSP> they replicate
[3:27:19] <brachydios777> Some would solve it in less loops than others, theoretically
[3:27:19] <IndoorSitup> SELF REPLICATING probes
[3:27:22] <aiwass8> Self replication
[3:27:24] <%Amaideus> The probes work the same way the nanovirus works
[3:27:24] <Blank9> or until they run out of asteroids or hit a black hole
[3:27:27] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus Dont forget the personality difference that occured between Ida and Shu so there are chances of divergences. And there is also a chance of Prof. Mori was reborn in another world. Several times perhaps
[3:27:31] <bear_breaker20> perpetual machines plus the literal universe of minerals its infinite
[3:27:34] <+0neReeler> finite possibilities
[3:27:36] <%Amaideus> It replicates forever, but it also DUPLICATES foreber
[3:27:36] <xbb1024> If you were an alien species, you would see this as a plague
[3:27:38] <alphalejandro> And who's fault for the bad things on all of those possibilities, RYOKO!
[3:27:46] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Them probes be bangin themselves
[3:27:48] <+Sp3ctre48> @Amaideus Yeah, and I'm saying in different probes there could very well be occurrences where they don't discover sector 0 and and it eventually falls apart, and since they can't carry over their memories they just live in the simulation until they die without knowing what's coming
[3:27:49] <heartlesshealer> the probes expand like the edges of a slime mold, it's cool
[3:27:54] <%takutoots> hey so that virus that wiped out humanity was a micro verzion of the space probes
[3:27:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> God this game is so good

[3:28:03] <caramel_coffin> its pretty fucking stupid to blame the clone Ryoko for OG Ryokos fault
[3:28:03] <iheartmota> imagine spreading your seed across the universe

[3:28:14] <+jiggy_snipe> oh
[3:28:14] <RacistWakka> I think Ryoko just corrupted the program and the probes replicated
[3:28:16] <%Klefth> B R A T O V E R F L O W
[3:28:17] <+Unajer> "humans spreading their filth across the universe" This is why Ryoko sabotaged the plan

[3:28:21] <gamria> @Savior127 Shu only turned out different is because Ida moved him into Sector 4 instead of 3
[3:28:21] <DatAsuna> the flood also have weird extradimensional shit
[3:28:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @r_xanadu they have other genetic material

[3:28:59] <RacistWakka> This is one awkward pod
[3:29:00] <ShepherdShang> But Woolie, you jsu said Ryoko's genocide was bad, and now you're defending it?
[3:29:00] <+spartan_ermine> plot nudity
[3:29:01] <%sodamin1> GOD DAMN IT
[3:29:04] <Daxalog> 15 huh?
[3:29:05] <heartlesshealer> so the sentinel cockpits are the growth pods and THAT'S why they're naked
[3:29:07] <%cvp5127> they were naked for a reason
[3:29:11] <%sodamin1> woolie i just realized that
[3:29:11] <+Zasne> That's Juro OBVIOUSLY
[3:29:12] <%ChoculaUltra> wait, so were there ONLY 15 pods or only 15 people that actually used them?

[3:29:22] <soul_survive> Maybe George Kamitani was living in 2188 and we're all lagging behind
[3:29:25] <T_Sasquatch> The Tiktokers came in their alien vessel
[3:29:26] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus Can you explain how the Sectors work exactly? Is it an actual physical place or is it all virtual? In 2188 cutscenes they would show to be above certain sectors.
[3:29:27] <+Zasne> naked, but they got glasses

[3:29:44] <%Irridium> so did the nanomachines also do Tomi's ponytails?
[3:29:44] <Psyramics> @Savior127 they are virtual
[3:29:45] <IndoorSitup> Wait, so why did some of them wear glasses???????
[3:29:45] <pixel_river> Yet they still had glasses on in the portraits
[3:29:46] <+0neReeler> plot nudity
[3:29:47] <%Amaideus> @Savior127 It's all the matrix until the very end

[3:30:22] <thesilverbard> Megumi didn't have glasses when she got out, so she must have just thought she was wearing them
[3:30:22] <HeroToxiko> @IndoorSitup maybe they were farsighted, nearsighted people don't need them in a situation like that
[3:30:23] <mortificent> FUCKING ROBOCOP
[3:30:25] <DatAsuna> My favourite thing in infinite space is that humanity has a huge russian bias cause america gave up on nasa lol
[3:30:25] <%sodamin1> i need to see this
[3:30:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @cobalt_phoenix_ imagine if they still probably needed glasses out of the pods :lul:
[3:30:31] <+Zasne> no they go away
[3:30:33] <r_xanadu> @SuckerPunchSyd that's what I hope that one line means. Can't wait for the survivors to decide whether they should recreate another race, though. That's a dark road to go down
[3:30:35] <jorniev> wait so japan won ?
[3:30:38] <+skyheys> NO
[3:30:39] <heartlesshealer> THE ATTACKS
[3:30:40] <jubejube56> @Savior127 Sectors are virtual but were named after actual physical locations that existed in 2188. They mention that the structure of the Ark was similar to that of already existing Sectors.
[3:30:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> you can summon them via metasystem
[3:30:45] <+0neReeler> arasaka?
[3:30:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SuckerPunchSyd oof
[3:30:45] <%Amaideus> I found the artbook on a certain hentai website

[3:31:02] <IndoorSitup> @amaideus Whisper that shit please
[3:31:05] <%Amaideus> Search "13 sentinels doujins" and then go to the site that starts with E
[3:31:09] <Lancaster_H> Imagine this game, but with more money
[3:31:11] <%Amaideus> It's one of the top results
[3:31:12] <gamria> Project Ark was not originally designed to be a salvation project: while Minami and Yuki 2188 wanted 6 million humans, they were only able to harvest 15 uninfected Japanese people's DNA
[3:31:18] <RacistWakka> Vanilla you listening?
[3:31:18] <Blank9> look up "iori 13 sentinels cockpit art" and the 2nd result is a sample of the art
[3:31:21] <Blank9> and look at her mouth

[3:32:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @r_xanadu yeah theres one file I think when Natsuno’s talking about the plans where its 1.2 million per sector so 6mil in total so thats a lot of genetic info to pull from. With how many geneticists were on that last colony i dont think they’d make a bottleneck mistake
[3:32:03] <Blank9> pumping protein goo into their mouths

[3:33:06] <Savior127> @jubejube56 I know there were named based on time period but in the 2188 cutsenes it would say that they are above Sector 4 or something implying they're above something physical
[3:33:10] <r_xanadu> @SuckerPunchSyd Totally remember that, actually. Thanks for reminder

[3:33:59] <DatAsuna> mood
[3:34:00] <Futurecity10> Cheer500 this is basically the story of rimworld. In rimworld, thousands of years ago world terraforming ships were sent out into space to terraform and seed worlds. However since planets are barren, these world ships injected chem fuel, plasteel, and steel into the planets so any colony ships that arrive have a head start. So fun fact, the worlds the 15 live on, have literally 0 fossil fuels. They don’t even have coal
[3:34:00] <pixel_river> us?
[3:34:02] <caramel_coffin> Awesome Scifi story < Muh revenge bad story
[3:34:02] <Blank9> and nah, there's an art of it where she legit has goo strands to her mouth

[3:37:29] <Psyramics> or even any signs of ecosystems off Earth
[3:37:30] <+0neReeler> it was all a dream...
[3:37:32] <RacistWakka> Okino negligence and Ryoko wrath
[3:37:32] <pixel_river> And inifite probes
[3:37:34] <+Sp3ctre48> I dislike that kind of plot in concept but there's so much more than that going on here

[3:38:24] <RacistWakka> OG Okino wanted tosmooch Hijiyama too much
[3:38:28] <%Amaideus> How is Ei a project member
[3:38:32] <%Amaideus> That doesn't make sense
[3:38:39] <%Irridium> @Amaideus he was snuck on to kill Morimura
[3:38:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:38:44] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe they stole his dna
[3:38:46] <reonome> because he was the last one on the ship
[3:38:48] <+Sp3ctre48> He was one of the survivors, being part of the security team was his cover
[3:38:49] <r_xanadu> @ZweihanderSteve all of them? If so, wonder whether he made the connection
[3:38:49] <%Amaideus> Yeah, but who added him to the thing?
[3:38:50] <+Unajer> he was just one of the last people left. so they took his genetic information
[3:38:50] <RacistWakka> He wasnt
[3:38:55] <cizal11> He snuck on presumably under a false identity
[3:38:56] <+Zasne> Ei was given project acces by Gouto to kill
[3:38:58] <%Irridium> @Amaideus Gouto. He hired him
[3:39:01] <IndoorSitup> I refuse to believe that George Kamitani wrote all of this shit BY HIMSELF
[3:39:02] <Iphantom99> They just took anyone left at that point
[3:39:03] <%Amaideus> Oh, he was part of the "security team"
[3:39:05] <%Amaideus> Didn't know that
[3:39:07] <jubejube56> @Amaideus Renya Gouto snuck him onto the project to get him to kill Morimura
[3:39:11] <+Jaromero435> just because he was there
[3:39:11] <xbb1024> and the corporate leaders
[3:39:12] <RacistWakka> He just survived extinction
[3:39:14] <LycheeMusings> Don't forget Yakushiji who is just a child
[3:39:14] <%Weeewer> Gouto got him in as “security”
[3:39:15] <+sombraxyz> Megumi was just a kid
[3:39:19] <%ZweihanderSteve> @r_xanadu only aware of 1, 2 and despair girls

[3:39:22] <Zeif00> They ALL hot

[3:39:31] <%Miles_Hikari> Ei was Security personell
[3:39:32] <%Mrbaconator> DO IT
[3:39:32] <+0neReeler> renya gouto allowed it
[3:39:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> KEEP EM
[3:39:33] <+richardlikespies> murder isn't genetic
[3:39:34] <reonome> COOLEST GUY
[3:39:34] <%Amaideus> But I can explain it away as Gouto pulling shit
[3:39:37] <%Livelinne> OH NO HES HOT
[3:39:38] <KeroKamina> CUTE GUY
[3:39:39] <Isord> PLASTIC SURGIRIES STILL EXIST
[3:39:39] <%Mrbaconator> COOLEST GUY
[3:39:39] <DatAsuna> do nothing
[3:39:40] <pixel_river> Ei was morally grey
[3:39:41] <quietshun> No they don't, people will do stupid stuff eventually
[3:39:42] <%wibbwobbler> PunOko
[3:39:43] <ossiian> No hot people mean ugly new hot
[3:39:47] <KeroKamina> "CUTE GUY"
[3:39:52] <%AndrewRoivas> He's hot though...
[3:39:53] <BearSawed> Fuck you if everyones ugly then nobody is
[3:39:56] <Savior127> @Amaideus He most likely wasnt and snuck his way in to kill Mori. He also couldve added himself into the program to kill Mori over and over again for his revenge boner.
[3:39:57] <+jiggy_snipe> why did Gouto want to hire a hitman when only 15 people are left?
[3:39:57] <r_xanadu> @ZweihanderSteve makes sense, since everyone dunks on V3's ending.
[3:39:59] <+richardlikespies> murdering isn't a genetic trait
[3:40:01] <T_Sasquatch> Morales Gray
[3:40:03] <%Livelinne> The plum flower
[3:40:06] <+0neReeler> hot people are survivalists
[3:40:08] <jubejube56> @Amaideus I believe the idea is that he gets onto the ship, the apocalypse happens, and only 15 humans remain on the ship to finish Project Ark.
[3:40:15] <T_Sasquatch> damn i should name a character that
[3:40:15] <Lancaster_H> thats a big ass SSD
[3:40:20] <jubejube56> So they are the only real DNA candidates to choose from by that point
[3:40:24] <T_Sasquatch> don't steal my idea chat !
[3:40:27] <alephalpha> @jiggy_snipe he did before hand and then ei stillw nated to kill her cause she wa sresponsible for the nanomchanie pague
[3:40:38] <%Amaideus> I assumed the ship was launched after the plague hits
[3:40:40] <+jiggy_snipe> @alephalpha oh ok
[3:40:46] <RacistWakka> He hired before that Ei just completed for revenge
[3:40:58] <+Jaromero435> BUT ME THO
[3:40:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MMMMMMMEEEEE
[3:41:00] <%Amaideus> To be fair
[3:41:00] <%osaka_daioh> And that's human nature
[3:41:03] <ShoggothHat> It's very human
[3:41:07] <Lancaster_H> if she's smart enough to destroy humanity, she's smart enough to save it
[3:41:07] <+Zasne> Cause she wanted to make up for that... she didn't intentionally destroy humanity
[3:41:08] <%Weeewer> Meeeee
[3:41:09] <%JustToWatch> "It's ok, this time I got it for sure"
[3:41:09] <caramel_coffin> H u m a n s
[3:41:11] <mortificent> BUT MEEEEEEEE
[3:41:11] <%Amaideus> She's the one who'd know exactly what went wrong and how to not do it again
[3:41:13] <+Zasne> In fact, thats where Kengo comes in
[3:41:17] <caramel_coffin> WE LIVE IN A HUMANITY
[3:41:18] <%SouLucha> I destroy humanity, I create it.
[3:41:19] <corinv> That's exactly why Ida called them hypocrites in his 2188 scene
[3:41:19] <+0neReeler> don't discover the tech that ended humanity
[3:41:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Kengo actually fucked up humanity
[3:41:21] <%Amaideus> But it's still hyper selfish
[3:41:27] <cizal11> Technically she created the means for humanity to be destroyed, but kengo is the one who actually did it
[3:41:28] <+Sp3ctre48> Well she didn't do it on purpose, she watched the Colony fall apart and she wanted to make up for being responsible for humanities extinction
[3:41:36] <%Weeewer> They’re not SUPPOSED to know about the future
[3:41:40] <+0neReeler> load savestate
[3:41:43] <%Weeewer> They’re not supposed to be time traveling
[3:41:44] <Lancaster_H> it's selfish, but logical, considering she's brilliant
[3:41:49] <Monkeyweed21> different culture, different ways of thinking
[3:42:02] <%AMUSERNAME> KEIKAKU DORI
[3:42:14] <+jiggy_snipe> adults?
[3:42:14] <%ekodrop> the camera cut is unfortunate for woolie. giving him pat's hairline
[3:42:16] <+Zasne> the same as they always do
[3:42:16] <alephalpha> different cultures and different ways of thinking
[3:42:18] <pixel_river> anime
[3:42:18] <+jiggy_snipe> ooooo
[3:42:20] <Monkeyweed21> 20 years old
[3:42:20] <RacistWakka> Selfish and egocentric just like agenius
[3:42:22] <%osaka_daioh> Yeah
[3:42:25] <r_xanadu> Wonder if one of the final parts of the plan was to erase all existence of nanomachines and the interlociturs
[3:42:27] <%osaka_daioh> Which is why there's 2 years of learning
[3:42:28] <%Weeewer> It would have been 3 from each region, and then they would teach each other about their cultures
[3:42:29] <Blank9> they'd have 2 years to adjust
[3:42:31] <CappuccinoGuil> At 18, they are put in a 2 year learning
[3:42:33] <+Sp3ctre48> They would have been 20 years old to start with and have different experiences through the cultures they grew up in
[3:42:34] <+Unajer> during the 2 years of training, they'd be taught everything
[3:42:36] <%osaka_daioh> 2 years to adjust, yeah.
[3:42:37] <quietshun> That's what the training is for
[3:42:39] <%Irridium> not quite, they'd have two years of prep beforehand if everything went according to keikaku
[3:42:39] <+BigCoffee> 2 year traingin
[3:42:39] <+Zasne> Nope. The sectors were just in that setting, they WOULD have bene informed of the truth
[3:42:39] <Isord> No, thats what the training is
[3:42:42] <%Amaideus> There are definitely problems there
[3:42:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> when they hit 18 they would get the transmission that explains it
[3:42:48] <corinv> There was a 2 year plan when they turn 18 to tell them everything
[3:42:48] <%doombawkzvs> Thats what training is for
[3:42:48] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:42:49] <aiwass8> 2 years training arc
[3:42:50] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:42:51] <heartlesshealer> the two years would be integration
[3:42:52] <%wibbwobbler> morimura was insane
[3:42:53] <Blank9> they had less than 2 years to adjust for everyone
[3:42:53] <cizal11> Lmao
[3:42:54] <%Amaideus> What if one of them can't handle it and decides to go kill themselves?
[3:42:57] <DatAsuna> perfect
[3:42:58] <Blank9> for this loop
[3:42:59] <caramel_coffin> AMERICANS GONE
[3:43:00] <+BigCoffee> Woolie 2 year
[3:43:00] <%Amaideus> AFTER they get out of the pods
[3:43:04] <RacistWakka> They probably had different courses
[3:43:05] <cizal11> Better than what
[3:43:07] <Lancaster_H> dude america died 20 million years ago
[3:43:08] <%Livelinne> LUL
[3:43:08] <+BigCoffee> they get out at 20
[3:43:08] <%doombawkzvs> When they turn 18 they get 2 years of training
[3:43:12] <alephalpha> basically none of them coudl agree
[3:43:13] <+JustBlubs> They felt the diversity was worth the possible issues with adjustment
[3:43:14] <+0neReeler> the failsafe is they have to beat the kaiju?
[3:43:14] <%ekodrop> wwii doesn't exist to the japanese
[3:43:14] <%dkzk21> maybe thats why morimura wanted to lead.
[3:43:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Because it's a teaching system made by the literal brightest minds of humanity
[3:43:15] <%Irridium> look that's what the old Japanese men wanted, that's what they get
[3:43:18] <alephalpha> and this was ashitty compromise
[3:43:18] <r_xanadu> This reminds me: are there different versions of the 15 characters? Like, is there a version of Tomi in all 5 sectors?
[3:43:19] <+jiggy_snipe> 2 years isn't alot to adjust
[3:43:19] <+Zasne> there is no confusion... they would be told the truth.
[3:43:22] <%Weeewer> They needed to rebirth the CULTURE of humanity
[3:43:24] <alphalejandro> what's America in this new earth Kappa
[3:43:24] <heartlesshealer> it really does suck
[3:43:26] <%kyh9> To see what kind of era yields the best peoples
[3:43:26] <LycheeMusings> Hijiyama fucking with the DNA to prevent any Americans from being born
[3:43:26] <pixel_river> Metaphor for school life
[3:43:27] <%SouLucha> I think this was a hold over from the pre-fucked earth Interstellar plan.
[3:43:28] <%osaka_daioh> yeah it does suck. But that's life.
[3:43:28] <OblivionSword1> 2 years not enough for that shit
[3:43:29] <alephalpha> they couldn't agree and it was a shitty compromise
[3:43:30] <Monkeyweed21> different cultures means different ways of thinking @WoolieVersus
[3:43:30] <%Drunkengen> I mean Amercia is forever gone
[3:43:30] <%Amaideus> WE CAN'T TREAT THEM ALL LIKE X
[3:43:31] <BanquoViaquo> Like Miura said in his first scene, he figures that was the era that permanently reshaped their ideologies
[3:43:34] <Arancet> 2 years is a lot more than they actually got!
[3:43:34] <%Weeewer> Tamao stressed that culture is part of what makes humans humans
[3:43:35] <%osaka_daioh> They don't have anymore time.
[3:43:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait I just realized, if the sim goes 18 years, and at the 16 year mark WWII ends, then they planned for the kids in sector 5 to see the nukes
[3:43:37] <jorniev> america is already doomeds my man
[3:43:40] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus My take would be to try and mix all of the era's cultures to pick the best aspects out of each other them and merge together.
[3:43:43] <RacistWakka> THEY WOULD TALK WOOLIE
[3:43:44] <xbb1024> The new conflict would be between planets
[3:43:45] <%Irridium> humanity got hard fucked this is all they got
[3:43:53] <CappuccinoGuil> "It's not 1945, but hear me out: Yakissoba Pan"
[3:43:57] <+0neReeler> if they can't adjust in 2 years, how will they lead humanity
[3:43:59] <%Weeewer> THEY WOULD JUST TALK
[3:44:06] <corinv> The diversity is because they give people experiences to live in peace, war, different developments of technology and culture, which teaches them how to resolve conflict and develop society
[3:44:06] <pixel_river> Kamitani literally said this an coming of age story
[3:44:07] <cizal11> It’s future therapy they aint gotta explain shit
[3:44:12] <%doombawkzvs> They share a Yakisoba pan and that'll fix it all
[3:44:17] <+BigCoffee> @cobalt_phoenix_ they are in a city far away from the nukes
[3:44:20] <%Aceofstaves> just talk, right woolie? isn't that the solution
[3:44:25] <%Amaideus> Also people adjust really quickly to shit
[3:44:25] <Savior127> @corinv Agreed
[3:44:26] <RacistWakka> Just talk
[3:44:28] <LycheeMusings> I mean you can make the argument for having a militaristic industrialist society if you want to get things done
[3:44:31] <thesilverbard> I blame Miura for the inclusion of sector 5. I can't imagine anyone else thinking that's a good time period to pick
[3:44:36] <+Unajer> @corinv this exactly
[3:44:36] <%Amaideus> Definitely not anime-quick
[3:44:39] <%Irridium> look, they HAVE to teach about the GLORIOUS EMPIRE that did nothing wrong
[3:44:40] <%AMUSERNAME> The argument seems to be IN FAVOR of cultural diversity. The 1945 kids bring in some positive traits to the team, despite the need to adjust to the world-shaking revelations. Seems to be the reasoning, IMO
[3:44:41] <%Amaideus> But still
[3:44:41] <KeroKamina> PRE WAR 40s too
[3:44:43] <alephalpha> okino being super annoyed as everyone asks them to make 5 secotrs in however many days they had
[3:44:45] <+0neReeler> learn by mistakes by living it
[3:44:46] <Blank9> Old men, running the world.
[3:44:46] <%wibbwobbler> at least they're "human"?
[3:44:50] <+Zasne> Theyd be informed of the truth from the very start, and be able to even shift... its why they can shift in the first place
[3:44:51] <Blank9> Old men... are the future.
[3:44:51] <%JustToWatch> the science nerds in horizon zero dawn had a much more solid "rebuild humanity" plan
[3:44:53] <%Drunkengen> WHATTA ABOUT THE 80s?
[3:44:56] <%Livelinne> I smell bad politics behind this system spaceyeenYeen
[3:44:57] <Monkeyweed21> Miura LOVED the 40's and pushed for that time period
[3:45:00] <LycheeMusings> Hijiyama: War Crimes? What about those?"
[3:45:02] <RacistWakka> CULTURAL DIVERSITY
[3:45:04] <Dreamedlint> 5 fifths compromise
[3:45:10] <+BigCoffee> @AMUSERNAME Miura and Tamao where really gentle kids despite everything that happens, and Hijiyama did shape up
[3:45:14] <penitentpendant> But why Imperealistic Japan?
[3:45:21] <lemon_lore> flat earther
[3:45:24] <penitentpendant> A sense of loss?
[3:45:29] <%ZweihanderSteve> miura just wanted to live in the low tech 1940's lmao
[3:45:38] <Blank9> 1940s kid that now has to learn 2188 genetic engineering
[3:45:39] <+jiggy_snipe> sure it's cultural diversity but it's still only Japan at different points
[3:45:40] <%Weeewer> They needed to know where they wanted to come from
[3:45:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:45:41] <Monkeyweed21> Miura was REALLY into 40's Japan
[3:45:41] <Blank9> good luck
[3:45:43] <alephalpha> lucky that hijiyama s ahimbo at heart
[3:45:44] <gamria> @JustToWatch Unlike Zero Dawn, Project Ark here was just Shikishima winging everything
[3:45:45] <alphalejandro> Miura was a nerd
[3:45:49] <+JustBlubs> You think Universal Control is programmed to stop them from being big problems
[3:45:53] <%Amaideus> It's not only japan actually
[3:45:55] <RacistWakka> They would TALK
[3:45:56] <mortificent> Imperial Japan is big yikes
[3:45:58] <Savior127> So are the Sectors physical harddrives? Where are the simulation process taking place?
[3:46:01] <%Amaideus> Because they have the data from the rest of the world
[3:46:01] <LycheeMusings> Miura was a Tojoboo
[3:46:02] <+BigCoffee> @gamria they where forced ro rush the priject
[3:46:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do you think that secotr 5 includes nanking?
[3:46:09] <%Amaideus> And the sims still act as if those other places were there
[3:46:12] <%Weeewer> LUL
[3:46:13] <+BigCoffee> JUST TALK
[3:46:14] <%Livelinne> Darn Netouyos
[3:46:15] <%doombawkzvs> They would share a Yakisoba
[3:46:19] <+0neReeler> when you get to play god
[3:46:19] <pixel_river> talk no jutsu
[3:46:20] <jubejube56> They would talk about the great war
[3:46:24] <+skyheys> JUST. TALK.
[3:46:24] <%doombawkzvs> Talk and Yakisoba will solve everything
[3:46:25] <%Weeewer> It didn’t “suck” for them though
[3:46:30] <%astrofizzix> And who would have the head start? Morimura, her crush, and her biological on
[3:46:31] <+jiggy_snipe> tbf 2 years is enough to adjust to anything, it's different planet anyway
[3:46:32] <mortificent> THEY WOULD BE IMPERIALIST, CHAT
[3:46:36] <+skyheys> god if only the could just talk
[3:46:39] <cizal11> So what you’re saying is just talk isn’t always the answer???
[3:46:39] <RacistWakka> It would suck but talk!
[3:46:43] <Monkeyweed21> Miura had a hard-on for the 40's and pushed for it be included
[3:46:43] <%wibbwobbler> culture shock is real
[3:46:44] <CappuccinoGuil> I think they should've made the learning process be 5-6 years
[3:46:49] <%Aceofstaves> what, but I thought just talk was a cure all
[3:46:51] <%JustToWatch> @gamria I would argue that the zero dawn project was also winging it
[3:46:51] <alephalpha> we wer eon eyar 4500
[3:46:53] <+Unajer> time limit for looping
[3:46:58] <%Weeewer> And THERE is why the loops end eventually
[3:46:58] <alephalpha> wait
[3:47:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh fuck it really was their last shot
[3:47:04] <alephalpha> not we were almost to
[3:47:05] <+richardlikespies> i hope the racism and homophia patch was applied
[3:47:06] <%Amaideus> But then the pods get rebuilt at some point right?
[3:47:06] <+Sp3ctre48> So they had about 2000 years left before the facility would break

[3:48:05] <%doombawkzvs> 200 years left to achieve racial purity - Brainmom 2020
[3:48:11] <arkv01> but the racism goes handin hand with the brain LUL
[3:48:11] <Dumple_Roe> Math injected
[3:48:14] <%Livelinne> LUL
[3:48:19] <%Amaideus> Correct @Aceofstaves
[3:48:20] <Triplicat> did someone link the 1st anniversary dev interview
[3:48:27] <alephalpha> maintenance is much harde rin atmospher
[3:48:34] <RacistWakka> Lets not go there chat
[3:48:34] <%Amaideus> Even if she did know there'd be more loops after, it wouldn't change anything for her though
[3:48:35] <+0neReeler> finite
[3:48:35] <%Weeewer> Remember, the facility didn’t know that the kaiju would attack
[3:48:39] <Althallos> @Sp3ctre48 About 5000 tho. so anywhere near that could probably already make it shit the bed
[3:48:40] <cizal11> Theoretically can’t the probes make new facilities if one fails though?
[3:48:41] <%Amaideus> The urgency is not being able to carry over
[3:48:42] <%Weeewer> So 5000 years should be plenty
[3:48:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[3:48:50] <%ZweihanderSteve> the satellite would create a new facility after the 5,000 years or the facilities no longer functional
[3:48:51] <%Amaideus> Yeah exactly @cizal11
[3:48:51] <+call_me_comic> not babies, teenagers
[3:48:51] <alephalpha> well they would have lif eon it
[3:48:52] <pixel_river> you can see the facilities are overgrown on "The Truth" illustration
[3:48:53] <Arancet> it will make a NEW facility, but sector 0 and etc get erased
[3:48:54] <%SouLucha> Most of those years traveling space.
[3:48:55] <LycheeMusings> unlimited baby works
[3:48:57] <Blank9> and yet it's already terraformed
[3:48:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Dead teenagers
[3:48:58] <+BigCoffee> The facility can also be rebuilt for another 5000y mega loop
[3:49:00] <%kyh9> THANKS RYOKO, THANKS IDA
[3:49:02] <+BigCoffee> it's just sector 0 is wiped
[3:49:03] <BanquoViaquo> What a choke, to have successfully terraformed a planet for years and years, and then die in these final moments
[3:49:03] <alephalpha> it woudl alreayd be etrraforme dwith life
[3:49:05] <Blank9> genocided that planet for nothing
[3:49:06] <%wibbwobbler> find a mech or two
[3:49:07] <xbb1024> but the planet would be terraformed already
[3:49:08] <IndoorSitup> @triplicat Skelly did but I don't know if they'll read it
[3:49:10] <RacistWakka> Hundreds of worlds GONE
[3:49:10] <%Weeewer> @cizal11 yes, but they never accounted for the process to take all 5000 years
[3:49:12] <alephalpha> so it would become aseed of new life still
[3:49:13] <jorniev> JUST REUSE THE BIO MASS
[3:49:14] <%baka_sugoi> de babys
[3:49:16] <%doombawkzvs> Unlimited babbie works
[3:49:19] <rosemon5001> there are going to be planets that just get cometed or asteroid hit
[3:49:20] <+Jaromero435> FUCK DEM BABIES
[3:49:20] <%Drunkengen> BILLIONS OF BABIES DEAD
[3:49:23] <linSP> Dead baby storage
[3:49:23] <soul_survive> basically a hard reset
[3:49:23] <DatAsuna> "they died like babies" -- donald trump
[3:49:24] <Arancet> "wow thats a big pile"
[3:49:24] <KaiserMario> What do you mean graveyeard? More like, they recycle the dead babies into food for the new ones
[3:49:27] <+0neReeler> so uh how do they dispose the babies?
[3:49:28] <%dkzk21> Oops! Dead babies.
[3:49:31] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:49:33] <LycheeMusings> Yeah Ryoko, good job
[3:49:33] <%Amaideus> Soylent greeeeen
[3:49:36] <arkv01> its okay they weren't real babies anyways
[3:49:37] <%JustToWatch> @gamria you would think that something similar would have happened to the arc project once the nano plague started, but it's probably best just to not think to hard about it
[3:49:38] <Triplicat> nanomachines break them down in the pods
[3:49:38] <soflicar> they wouldn't be babies they would be a lot of dead 16 yo's
[3:49:40] <rosemon5001> Unlimited Dead Baby works
[3:49:40] <Iphantom99> recycling :)
[3:49:46] <%Amaideus> Honestly why Ryoko let them hit 16, who knows
[3:49:49] <Monkeyweed21> @0neReeler recycling bin
[3:49:50] <%doombawkzvs> Oops! We made too many (dead babies)!
[3:49:53] <Triplicat> addressed in the dev interview
[3:49:53] <%Amaideus> Just kill them 2 years into the loop
[3:49:54] <Blank9> true, dead teens
[3:49:56] <Blank9> fuck them kids
[3:49:56] <%Amaideus> Or 2 months
[3:49:58] <%Weeewer> As long as the probes replicate, it’s still infinite. But there is a time limit per facility
[3:49:58] <RacistWakka> They WERE REAL BABIES CHAT
[3:50:01] <%Amaideus> Same difference
[3:50:03] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus Another Facility would just be made after the old one expires hence the last loop being referred to the "grand reset"
[3:50:03] <+0neReeler> ecofriendly babies
[3:50:03] <r_xanadu> On the plus side: if someone else decides to destroy humanity with nanomachines, now they don't have to look that hard to find habitable planets
[3:50:06] <+Zasne> It's amazing, Kaimtani is a genius
[3:50:06] <%Irridium> @Amaideus Let the Ida clone grow up and have it all taken from him. because fuck him, probably
[3:50:09] <caramel_coffin> BEST NARRATIVE
[3:50:12] <%Amaideus> Fair
[3:50:12] <%SkellyVee> waoPog
[3:50:14] <%Amaideus> I'll take that
[3:50:16] <halfmasks> if the facility fails, cant the Probe make another facility on the same planet?
[3:50:19] <IndoorSitup> "Fuck dem kids." -- Michael Jordan
[3:50:22] <KeroKamina> TOOK 6 YEARS TO WRITE
[3:50:22] <+jiggy_snipe> ah
[3:50:24] <RacistWakka> This game ROCKS!!!!
[3:50:25] <%SouLucha> Yep, this game is damn great.
[3:50:25] <%Irridium> that's what I'm going off anyway
[3:50:27] <DatAsuna> There's some good ass sci-fi novels with similar premises
[3:50:30] <ShepherdShang> Some of the best written sci-fi I've come across in years
[3:50:36] <+BigCoffee> @halfmasks Sure could, but it means sector 0 is wiped, do that batch ends
[3:50:37] <%osaka_daioh> it's true!
[3:50:42] <+jiggy_snipe> ok it would just be a big reset cuz the probe is still around probably to make another facility
[3:50:42] <%osaka_daioh> It doesn't answer everything.
[3:50:45] <+Zasne> Ive been learning more watching your stream, and will definitely be on my second playthru
[3:50:46] <%Drunkengen> 13 SENTINELS LASTS FOREVER
[3:50:50] <%Amaideus> Well good thing Woolie
[3:50:50] <jack_s1n> the baby juices get reused for the next clone
[3:50:52] <%Weeewer> @halfmasks they never accounted for the kaiju attacks, the probe probably isn’t made to keep replicating the entire facility
[3:50:53] <RacistWakka> Your danfics are real
[3:50:54] <%osaka_daioh> Exactly, I learned even more rewatching you
[3:50:54] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @fetrigon
[3:50:55] <gamria> @JustToWatch Hey, I definitely think Zero Dawn is much better planned. It's just a pity that Morimura here is Faro rather than
[3:51:00] <pixel_river> more plz
[3:51:00] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Read the Q&A Skelly sent you.
[3:51:00] <caramel_coffin> SUPPORT VANILLAWARE
[3:51:01] <%Aceofstaves> @halfmasks that's the big grand reset. note of the characters from prior loops want that since the big reset destroys sector 0 too
[3:51:01] <corinv> 13 Sentinels is SELF REPLICATING
[3:51:04] <%Amaideus> This game sold like shit, so not many hyper nerds to Vaati this!
[3:51:06] <Savior127> The fact that they're going to try making the AI into Humans makes me think that things are going to get absolutely fucked.
[3:51:06] <%Amaideus> YAY
[3:51:15] <%Kriss1827> just wait foe the spoilercast on monday wools
[3:51:16] <gamria> Sobeck, so she didn't bring it up with world leaders
[3:51:17] <%Livelinne> Ship them. That helps
[3:51:17] <%bread_assassin> There’s like 297 loops worth of fan fiction
[3:51:26] <%SouLucha> No need for headcannon, it's pretty straight forward. That article fills in some plot holes nicely too.
[3:51:29] <%ZweihanderSteve> innerloceters lmao
[3:51:29] <+jiggy_snipe> it's all sensory
[3:51:33] <+BigCoffee> @Savior127 It's going to take them forever to do that, it coudl take them decades to work it ouy
[3:51:35] <Isord> Its like the matric
[3:51:37] <pixel_river> somone calculted 11 000 sold in the west on a thread
[3:51:38] <gamria> You had unhighlighted Nightmare and the 2100's, 2060's, etc. so read those again
[3:51:39] <Isord> *matrix
[3:51:39] <%RyTYoung> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:51:39] <alephalpha> Okino did a relaly good job
[3:51:43] <%Drunkengen> TRUTH
[3:51:46] <halfmasks> @Aceofstaves yeah i know that, but im just not agreeing with woolie's idea (at least as i understand it) of 1 probe = 1 facility
[3:51:46] <+Jaromero435> You die in the game you die for real
[3:51:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT GREAT GAME
[3:51:49] <+JacknZack27> You skipped a few
[3:51:50] <reonome> ITS OVER
[3:51:51] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Woolie are sure you're even really awake right now
[3:51:53] <Monkeyweed21> and then the reset happens and the pod gets recycled
[3:51:56] <brunoberserk> AH MY FAKE WOUND
[3:51:57] <%Weeewer> @woolieversus area 4 is, and I’m not joking 10 THOUSAND bonus missions
[3:51:57] <Charbic> One more point tho
[3:51:58] <+Dragon4234> @WoolieVersus Ya forgot the Years
[3:51:58] <Iphantom99> bless Vanillaware
[3:52:05] <aiwass8> You skipped eras
[3:52:06] <Dumple_Roe> What was the last mystery point?
[3:52:08] <RacistWakka> I think Kamitami took 5 years to write this story
[3:52:08] <MyNameIsRasus> I wanted to see everyone outrside of the pods
[3:52:10] <%JustToWatch> @gamria there's definitely enough similarity though that you have to wonder if the devs took SOME inspiration from horizon though
[3:52:13] <%AMUSERNAME> We really were the 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim all along! Kappa
[3:52:15] <Althallos> Just saw the cover art for the remix/arrange cd of the soundtrack, hello cool
[3:52:20] <+Zasne> And Nightmare
[3:52:24] <+Jaromero435> Yeah there are 9,999 bonus missions
[3:52:51] <%Weeewer> And they get HARD
[3:52:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[3:52:53] <%ZweihanderSteve> at least 400 hours of RTS gameplay
[3:52:57] <+jiggy_snipe> 1
[3:52:58] <%Weeewer> I’m on mission 33 and already strugfling
[3:53:01] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:53:01] <Blank9> professor morimura is a bit of a bitch to not put okino and hijiyama in the same sector, given she KNOWS they were dating in 2188
[3:53:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 1
[3:53:04] <%Weeewer> Struggling*
[3:53:05] <+Zasne> you also missed Nightmare
[3:53:14] <%Irridium> they say you missed nightmare right above the dates
[3:53:17] <aiwass8> Read reasoning for including eras
[3:53:18] <Savior127> Another point is the chances of another world succeeding according to Prof Mori's plan where she, Juro, and Kengo are reborn with all the past memories intact. Meaning they would know and possibly try to interact with other colonized worlds.
[3:53:20] <alphalejandro> And Miwako was a sweet npc girl
[3:53:22] <cizal11> Notice the exact three in sector 1 lol. Mom dad and kid
[3:53:23] <%doombawkzvs> You missed nightmare
[3:53:26] <+JacknZack27> You also skipped the Nightmare
[3:53:26] <Iphantom99> Okino was her child though
[3:53:34] <+Jaromero435> Can I just say fuck that one boss in particular that keeps showing up in the bonus missions LUL
[3:53:41] <%RyTYoung> yea
[3:53:45] <%osaka_daioh> yeah this is why it was missing
[3:53:49] <caramel_coffin> O-KINO
[3:53:51] <Triplicat> they watch the last new scene from here?
[3:53:52] <Psyramics> interaction with other colonized worlds is highly unlikely, given it took them 20 million years to cross 1400 light years
[3:53:53] <%osaka_daioh> all that complaining before
[3:53:55] <%Amaideus> @Savior127 But they're lightyears apart, so not that much fuckery that can be done on the macro-est scale
[3:53:56] <%wibbwobbler> woolieT
[3:54:02] <gamria> Read Nightmare again
[3:54:05] <+Sp3ctre48> @Triplicat yes
[3:54:14] <Triplicat> good
[3:54:15] <+Zasne> GET IN THE ROBOT. LITERALLY.
[3:54:18] <%Amaideus> Unless they wanna send more AI versions of themselves out, but there's not much a point
[3:54:19] <+jiggy_snipe> @Amaideus unless there happens to be 2 terraformed planets in the same solar system
[3:54:20] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Althallos
[3:54:20] <Triplicat> thx
[3:54:23] <%Irridium> LUL

[3:55:42] <+DontMindMee> 1 loop ago was the one who came into the cell to talk to loop 2 version, and then gets killed by him
[3:55:42] <+justianxix> this one is random and dies
[3:55:43] <%AMUSERNAME> This is kid-juro, does nothing in his loop.
[3:55:46] <%Aceofstaves> yeah, this is just three one who gets merced

[3:55:49] <irfan_> click it and pause at the start

[3:57:30] <%kyh9> REAL KILLS
[3:57:34] <Monkeyweed21> MULTI-KILL
[3:57:35] <+Jaromero435> CONFIRMED KILLS
[3:57:35] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Read the "Nightmare" mystery file, someone said you missed something there.
[3:57:39] <%Amaideus> @Savior127 True, but the odds of that scenario happening and the two planets both having people to interact with are minescule
[3:57:39] <%ChoculaUltra> Ei might've been an assassin, but he ain't got shit on Kid Killer Izumi
[3:57:40] <%Weeewer> REAL dead
[3:57:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> here's the thing though, I think this is separate from the incident ida lied about to morimura
[3:57:40] <%cvp5127> coolest guy
[3:57:42] <%kyh9> And he helped save everyone in the end
[3:57:43] <%osaka_daioh> No he's dead.
[3:57:46] <%JustToWatch> HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY
[3:57:46] <%Weeewer> Juro is cool
[3:57:47] <%SouLucha> Not quite right...
[3:57:48] <%osaka_daioh> That isn't the correct one.
[3:57:48] <%kyh9> @cvp5127 Actually the coolest guy
[3:57:50] <RacistWakka> And HE WAS HOT
[3:57:53] <+Sp3ctre48> Well we know he didn't kill Hijiyama, Miura, Tamao and Tomi
[3:57:53] <caramel_coffin> COOLEST GUY
[3:57:53] <cizal11> Read the nightmare
[3:57:55] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:57:56] <%osaka_daioh> No that's Juro from 1 loop ago

[3:57:58] <%kyh9> KENGO GETS DEATH
[3:58:00] <+skyheys> THEY DIDNT DIE SO WHO CARES
[3:58:00] <%doombawkzvs> He was the COOLEST guy
[3:58:00] <%Weeewer> ONE GUY
[3:58:01] <aiwass8> He didn’t knew yet
[3:58:01] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Read the "Nightmare" mystery file, someone said you missed something there
[3:58:02] <+Zasne> Kengo doesn't matter dude
[3:58:03] <%kyh9> KENGO GETS PERMA DEATH
[3:58:03] <+jiggy_snipe> Kengo fucked humanity
[3:58:03] <%cvp5127> dropped plot point?
[3:58:05] <+JustBlubs> fuck kengo, we hate that guy
[3:58:06] <CappuccinoGuil> KENGO GETS *NOTHING*
[3:58:07] <+DontMindMee> Kengo got screwed because they never reached 18
[3:58:11] <%Drunkengen> DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[3:58:13] <r_xanadu> Juro Did Nothing Wrong
[3:58:14] <+jiggy_snipe> he probably survived on a different planent
[3:58:15] <%ZweihanderSteve> KENGO DOESNT GET SHIT
[3:58:15] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Kengo gets FUCKING NOTHING
[3:58:17] <quietshun> Kengo don't matter
[3:58:17] <OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus someone said to read the nightmare file
[3:58:18] <%RyTYoung> BibleThump
[3:58:18] <%doombawkzvs> woolieONEGUY
[3:58:18] <%Livelinne> shiaDingus
[3:58:19] <sketchpixels> kengo has evangelon
[3:58:20] <+sombraxyz> fuck that guy
[3:58:21] <%baka_sugoi> kango failed
[3:58:22] <RacistWakka> Kengo sucks
[3:58:23] <%SouLucha> Kengo got deleted fuck by based Gotou.
[3:58:24] <rosemon5001> TRIANGLE MAN IS KENGO
[3:58:25] <+Sp3ctre48> Kengo didn't matter, it's just context about why all this stuff in 2188 happened
[3:58:26] <heartlesshealer> dead forever
[3:58:26] <+fetrigon> he doesn't matter
[3:58:28] <+BigCoffee> He was always dead, he's a fake AI
[3:58:28] <%Irridium> may or may not be cut story content
[3:58:29] <Iphantom99> deleted
[3:58:30] <%AMUSERNAME> Man so basic, he SOUND ONLY LUL
[3:58:32] <%gatorafan> rip Palpatine
[3:58:32] <xbb1024> If Shinonome didn't do her thing, Kengo would be alive and leading the new colony
[3:58:33] <soflicar> they had no DNA for him for the simulation
[3:58:36] <Monkeyweed21> Kengo never got the memory transfer set up so he got deleted by the loops @WoolieVersus
[3:58:37] <Savior127> @Amaideus So the chances of 2 colonized planets while slim, is not unreasonable especially with terraforming. I mean shit, we could have a whole Gundam universe develop from that.
[3:58:38] <RacistWakka> Gouto deleted him
[3:58:39] <+jiggy_snipe> yea
[3:58:40] <caramel_coffin> FUCKED
[3:58:42] <aiwass8> He failed hard
[3:58:42] <+Jaromero435> He just wanted to take over Nenji, but never did
[3:58:43] <%Drunkengen> SOUND ONLY
[3:58:43] <%osaka_daioh> Cause it's an Eva reference
[3:58:45] <rosemon5001> PowerUpL TheIlluminati PowerUpR
[3:58:45] <%Amaideus> He's the one responsible for the plague getting out and he's the way Granny can use the highest level access stuff
[3:58:47] <caramel_coffin> GOT CUCKED OUT OF AI
[3:58:47] <+JacknZack27> He was the final guy
[3:58:48] <%kyh9> the scapeoat
[3:58:50] <%ChoculaUltra> 13 Sentinels Director's Cut WHEN
[3:58:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> kengo goaded morimura to fund the project with shady deals, then got fucked over
[3:58:50] <%Weeewer> It’s to have a true villain
[3:58:51] <%baka_sugoi> Q&A explains
[3:58:52] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus Go to nightmare
[3:58:57] <+0neReeler> wanted the same thing as hakase
[3:58:59] <reonome> -sound only-
[3:59:09] <heartlesshealer> Yuki yeah
[3:59:10] <+BigCoffee> Yuki's AI dad
[3:59:13] <%Livelinne> lowcoBewm
[3:59:15] <%Irridium> yeah check out Nightmare here
[3:59:15] <%wibbwobbler> commitment to the references is awesome
[3:59:16] <%osaka_daioh> that's his AI Dad
[3:59:16] <+BigCoffee> her fake computer dad
[3:59:18] <linSP> wait, MOM was the real evil???
[3:59:22] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Read the "Nightmare" mystery file, someone said you missed something there.
[3:59:23] <RacistWakka> Just for the EVA ref
[3:59:24] <%Amaideus> @Savior127 Yeah but given that you need 2 good planets, and then both need to escape their loops, it's not realistic
[3:59:24] <%cvp5127> ai parents LUL
[3:59:24] <cizal11> That’s yukis fake dad
[3:59:27] <+jiggy_snipe> yea to show you that Yuki came from a badass
[3:59:27] <caramel_coffin> KIRYU
[3:59:28] <%Amaideus> But it COULD happen
[3:59:30] <pixel_river> Give me the cut content as dlc plz
[3:59:35] <+skyheys> blues gone, fuck
[3:59:38] <+Zasne> Correct, so Morimura isn't the evil one
[3:59:43] <+0neReeler> fake dad majima
[3:59:43] <heartlesshealer> Kengo did the hostile takeover and used Ark to cover up a bunch of shit
[3:59:43] <%Amaideus> Man, the fanfiction for this game could've been super hype
[3:59:56] <RacistWakka> WHAT IF THE DETECTIVE IS KENGO?
[3:59:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:59:58] <%Amaideus> Also to be fair, it was always implied that Morimura released it by accident at worst
[3:59:59] <caramel_coffin> Yuki is from Morning Glory
[4:00:03] <cizal11> Woolie read that first bit again it explains juro like megumi entirely
[4:00:06] <%Amaideus> Or it was an unintended side effect
[4:00:09] <%Drunkengen> ALL DEAD
[4:00:13] <turbofolk> 13 Sentinels for Super Robot Wars when??
[4:00:20] <RacistWakka> Detective is amnesia Kengo
[4:00:21] <Psyramics> @Amaideus she sold the tech on the black market
[4:00:25] <MyNameIsRasus> The fact that he has 1 point left is triggering my OCD so hard
[4:00:25] <thesilverbard> That's in the entry for the colony
[4:00:27] <heartlesshealer> Ei 2188?
[4:00:29] <Arancet> think youre looking for 2188 hijiyama
[4:00:31] <%slayabee> Go to events and find out
[4:00:31] <Savior127> I think my biggest contention with this project is the possible negligence of the binary degradation.
[4:00:31] <Monkeyweed21> Ei Sekigahara killed Morimura before she could set up the memory transplants, Izumi only set up her memory transfer, meaning Kengo never got transferred and ended up getting deleted
[4:00:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Was it an event?
[4:00:42] <gamria> Colony in Orbit
[4:00:45] <+Dragon4234> @WoolieVersus Orbital Space Station
[4:00:45] <%Drunkengen> yes
[4:00:45] <OblivionSword1> maybe ?
[4:00:49] <heartlesshealer> check 2188 entries
[4:00:50] <%Amaideus> Yeah but that goes under "unintended consequences"
[4:01:04] <%Amaideus> Not "i released a nanoplague on purpose because reasons"
[4:01:04] <heartlesshealer> oh the 7 deaths
[4:01:08] <%Amaideus> That's Kengo's role
[4:01:20] <RacistWakka> Who died in that?
[4:01:21] <%Amaideus> To force the Ark project to get backing
[4:01:29] <%dkzk21> No
[4:01:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Okino, Hijiyama, Ogata, Izumi died, I believe
[4:01:49] <gamria> Morimura and Ei died before the shootout
[4:01:51] <Savior127> Also the concept of Time is FUCKED in space. It all goes into weird shit where time goes slower and faster relative to gravity.
[4:01:52] <%Weeewer> Probably Megumi
[4:01:56] <DubiousRhino> also probably Minami & Miura died in that shootout took
[4:01:57] <+Sp3ctre48> You can probably assume the rest died as the Colony was destroyed
[4:01:59] <thesilverbard> Hijiyama mentions in the log that Ida and Shinonome were the only survivors
[4:02:00] <sketchpixels> history repeats
[4:02:06] <jubejube56> I think it is implied that Ei and Morimura died due to Ei setting off the bomb which hit the power generator and led to the power debate shootout.
[4:02:10] <Monkeyweed21> the assassination was before the shootout
[4:02:16] <%cvp5127> and they did
[4:02:27] <cizal11> Ok woolie izumi now shoot okino
[4:02:27] <zhenthrim213> exactly
[4:02:27] <%Livelinne> WHY THERE WAS A GUN IN FIRST PLACE NotLikeThis indiea3BathroomGlock
[4:02:30] <Blank9> fuck that, let them live and they can make a new ark
[4:02:33] <%wibbwobbler> yea
[4:02:33] <%Amaideus> Ei setting off the bomb is how he got out of the locked room
[4:02:37] <%Irridium> And they did. After a little complication (shootout)
[4:02:41] <+0neReeler> (shootout)
[4:02:48] <%dkzk21> Gouto, Ryoko and Ida survivived, Takatoshi died shortly after making the log.
[4:02:53] <RacistWakka> Survival Woolie
[4:02:54] <%osaka_daioh> Woolie is avoiding the question
[4:03:02] <Monkeyweed21> Ei Sekigahara blew up the power generator, causing the debate @WoolieVersus
[4:03:03] <%Amaideus> So there's a period we don't know about between Ei and Morimura being alive, the bomb going off, and then the fight over what to do with life support energy
[4:03:03] <heartlesshealer> fast or slow was the choice
[4:03:05] <Blank9> The now ensures a future
[4:03:05] <linSP> kill yourself to save yourself from death
[4:03:07] <alphalejandro> Woolie is sus
[4:03:08] <Lancaster_H> this is getting stupid
[4:03:09] <halfmasks> answer the question: fast or slow death
[4:03:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Rerouting the power does NOT mean they immediately die, Woolie
[4:03:13] <NeonBleu> but do you avoid the suffering
[4:03:14] <%ekodrop> politician woolie
[4:03:18] <Daxalog> Woolie is sus
[4:03:24] <RacistWakka> How did Gouto died?
[4:03:27] <Triplicat> oh yeah so how about that Shinonome (2188) LUL
[4:03:28] <halfmasks> rerouting life support is not immediate death woolie
[4:03:28] <Blank9> If you could make that system, and you were alive, you could 100% make a new future ark
[4:03:30] <Savior127> This Plot also reminds me the Plot of SOMA minus colonizing another planet
[4:03:33] <chaos2frozen> Woolie makes it sound easy lol
[4:03:34] <%Amaideus> I don't think Gouto was ever on the Ark
[4:03:34] <cizal11> We know that answer woolie
[4:03:38] <cizal11> It was okino
[4:03:39] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Do you burn in the fire or jump out of the skyscraper?
[4:03:40] <+BigCoffee> @Amaideus All we know is Ryoko was the last, and Ida and Gouto made last minute changes to fuck over Kengo's plan
[4:03:43] <+Zasne> Juro is NOIT on that side
[4:03:48] <Triplicat> shinonome (real) is ok tho
[4:03:49] <cizal11> Jesus christ
[4:03:50] <thesilverbard> Ogata was on the side of continuing the project
[4:03:52] <jubejube56> Izumi probably also supported keeping life support up in order to keep his promise to protect Megumi
[4:03:55] <heartlesshealer> okino wanted to live w/ Hijiyama
[4:03:55] <+0neReeler> shoot them all
[4:04:03] <irfan_> juro shot okino whos on the "life support" side
[4:04:04] <+sombraxyz> actually is not Ogata, Okino is the one that wants life support
[4:04:09] <aiwass8> Ogata changed his mind
[4:04:10] <+Zasne> Juro is NOT one of his cronies
[4:04:12] <RacistWakka> But forreal how did OG Gouto died?
[4:04:16] <%Aceofstaves> Hijiyama and Okino wanted the life support
[4:04:18] <thesilverbard> Okino and Hijiyama wanted to cancel the project
[4:04:20] <%kyh9> OKINO wanted to prioritize life-support, everyone else wanted to go ahead with Ark
[4:04:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Kengo wanted the project to continue 2188 Ogata wanted it shut down
[4:04:21] <+Dachillin> Juro killed okino because he wanted life support instaed kf tbe project
[4:04:21] <%osaka_daioh> Are you judging by one person's comments?
[4:04:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Hijiyama and Okino wanted to cancel
[4:04:24] <%kyh9> I think
[4:04:25] <Blank9> juro shot hijiyama's emotional support twink, he's an ass
[4:04:27] <+call_me_comic> The point is all 15 of them were garbage in 2188 but their clones prove they could have been heroes
[4:04:32] <+0neReeler> follow orders
[4:04:37] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus Check the timeline!!!!
[4:04:37] <+Amaideus> He got shot because Juro shot Okino
[4:04:38] <%dkzk21> Juro only killed Okino because he wanted project Ark to go on.
[4:04:40] <%Aceofstaves> Okino wanted to kill the project
[4:04:40] <+BlueJoneleth> people just went nuts I guess
[4:04:43] <%Weeewer> Miura, Tamao and Minami are good in 2188
[4:04:43] <%Amaideus> It was straight up a revenge murder
[4:04:47] <+JacknZack27> Hijiyama and okino wanted life support
[4:04:48] <cizal11> Because okino wanted to turn off project ark
[4:04:48] <%dkzk21> Okimo wanted to end it.
[4:04:52] <ManlyMcBeefington> Okino was anti-ark
[4:04:54] <%kyh9> Okino was prioritizing Life Support, Presumably Izumi wanted to go ahead with Ark
[4:04:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> check ogata 88
[4:04:59] <RacistWakka> He wanted Gilfhiro
[4:05:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think
[4:05:01] <alphalejandro> check the timeline
[4:05:02] <%kyh9> @ManlyMcBeefington More like pro-life support
[4:05:04] <%kyh9> Lmao
[4:05:05] <+Dachillin> okino wanted to stop the project for life support
[4:05:05] <+Zasne> Okino wanted Life Support for them
[4:05:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Okino wanted to divert power to life support
[4:05:09] <%Seiryu92> Okino wanted lifesupport to live with Hijiyama, Ogata and Juro were pro Ark
[4:05:12] <IndoorSitup> Okina was anti-ark
[4:05:16] <aiwass8> Okino wanted to cancel the project
[4:05:16] <+BigCoffee> @kyh9 considering he cghanged the plan so Morimura take over her younger body, he was for it
[4:05:17] <+Sp3ctre48> Okino wanted to transfer the remaining power to the colony, Izumi was on Morimura's side in wanting Project Ark to go forward
[4:05:18] <%Amaideus> Okino wants to live, Hijiyama follows Okino, Juro shoots Okino, Hijiyama shoots Juro for shooting Okino
[4:05:21] <Blank9> izumi made the change before the shootout
[4:05:22] <gamria> Ogata now wanted Project Ark during the plague, while Okino wanted life support.
[4:05:23] <irfan_> okino supported life support because he said he wants to spend as much time with hijiyama
[4:05:31] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus Check the timeline!
[4:05:34] <+0neReeler> follow orders but likes chihiro
[4:05:40] <RacistWakka> Okino barely care for the project
[4:05:43] <%Amaideus> Juro's one of Nenji's lackeys, but he's loyal to Morimura
[4:05:48] <gamria> Ogata opposed prior to the plague, but wanted it during the plague
[4:05:49] <MyNameIsRasus> Ogata wanted the project to continue
[4:05:49] <irfan_> okino prioritized life support
[4:05:56] <caramel_coffin> Okino just wanted Himbo
[4:05:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[4:06:00] <cizal11> Just watch the damn scene again
[4:06:01] <+jiggy_snipe> rewatch the scene
[4:06:02] <sketchpixels> @WoolieVersus Check the event in hijiyama's timeline where he see his 2199 log
[4:06:02] <TukeArt> Okino wanted to prioritize life support
[4:06:02] <+Shadowpoco> YES
[4:06:03] <cizal11> Yes
[4:06:03] <Monkeyweed21> Okino wanted life support @WoolieVersus
[4:06:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Ogata wasn't opposed
[4:06:05] <+justianxix> ye
[4:06:05] <+Zasne> YES
[4:06:06] <+jiggy_snipe> just watch the scene
[4:06:07] <+BigCoffee> yes
[4:06:09] <%slayabee> Rewatch the scene
[4:06:10] <%Weeewer> Okino wants to live
[4:06:11] <+skyheys> YES
[4:06:12] <jubejube56> Where does it say that Okino prioritizes life support?
[4:06:15] <OblivionSword1> people say rewatch the scene
[4:06:17] <sketchpixels> log event
[4:06:18] <%kyh9> Okino wanted to prioritize life-support
[4:06:19] <xbb1024> he was just there, probably just following his boss
[4:06:22] <RacistWakka> Okino didn't care for the project
[4:06:22] <r_xanadu> So, Ogata changed his mind? When?
[4:06:24] <Arancet> its implied, never stated
[4:06:25] <+Sp3ctre48> It's in one of Gouto's events
[4:06:25] <%SouLucha> Yeah, it seemed like Okino was against the project. It's how i took it.
[4:06:27] <aiwass8> Ogata changed his mind
[4:06:27] <+skyheys> Okino bullshitted the system for life support
[4:06:30] <%Weeewer> Okino probably cared about the project until his own life was in danger (life support) @woolieversus
[4:06:30] <+Unajer> Okino didn't want the project to end, Okino wanted to prioritize life support tho
[4:06:31] <OblivionSword1> i don't know which part
[4:06:39] <Monkeyweed21> Ogata just escalated by pulling out a gun
[4:06:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Not this scene I think
[4:06:44] <+Jaromero435> You can support the project and not want to die too
[4:06:46] <+BigCoffee> @r_xanadu when the life of his clone was in jeopardy
[4:06:50] <%Irridium> "so then I started blasted"
[4:06:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Probably in the Hijiyama one
[4:06:56] <+Zasne> Remember, Morimura is the biggest advocate for the project, and her BF Juro sides with her.
[4:06:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:06:56] <%Irridium> blasting*
[4:07:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh I'm wrong
[4:07:05] <cizal11> Shinonome found it lol
[4:07:06] <%Livelinne> shiaCry
[4:07:08] <%Aceofstaves> Ogata changed his mind as the situation evolved, Okino wanted time with Hijiyama
[4:07:10] <%Weeewer> There it is
[4:07:12] <%osaka_daioh> There you go.
[4:07:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh there it is. Okino was team life support
[4:07:16] <Zeif00> There ya go
[4:07:16] <+Unajer> Okino never turned
[4:07:17] <Flagnalok> BJ implies that Ogata changed his mind and greenlit the project.
[4:07:17] <RacistWakka> Probably HEADCANON
[4:07:18] <+richardlikespies> BibleThump
[4:07:25] <%osaka_daioh> Okino is team Live Support
[4:07:27] <+fetrigon> okino wanted life support
[4:07:27] <%Weeewer> Project = important, Life support = most important
[4:07:28] <%baka_sugoi> shootout
[4:07:34] <+jiggy_snipe> see
[4:07:35] <%wibbwobbler> juro 2188 saves a kid at some point? i think
[4:07:35] <+Unajer> oh nvm
[4:07:36] <jubejube56> ahhh okay
[4:07:37] <+Zasne> There it is
[4:07:44] <thebalticguy1> Okino doesnt turn woolie, hed rather spend time with Hijiyama
[4:07:45] <RacistWakka> Cool
[4:07:47] <%osaka_daioh> ahhh
[4:07:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Ogata is team Ark here
[4:07:47] <+JacknZack27> He cares more about life support than the project
[4:07:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Okino wanted more time with Yakisoba Pan
[4:07:55] <+jiggy_snipe> people change their minds when the situation changed
[4:07:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> okino just wants more time on the clock
[4:08:01] <r_xanadu> @BigCoffee So when did Ogata's clone get messed up? This honestly is the most confusing part of the plot for me at this point
[4:08:01] <%kyh9> Okino vs Izumi in the energy debate, then Ogata shows up, armed, to FORCE the plan to end.
[4:08:05] <%Weeewer> The situation ESCALATED
[4:08:08] <Zeif00> Okina wants that BIG man
[4:08:09] <+Sp3ctre48> I mean you can probably assume the decision between life support vs Project Ark changed the situation
[4:08:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Was opposed
[4:08:09] <%Aceofstaves> HE DIDN'T STAY OPPOSED
[4:08:11] <thesilverbard> Ogata pulling a gun escalated the situation, but I guess we don't know which side he was on
[4:08:11] <+sombraxyz> he could have change his mind
[4:08:13] <%kyh9> Ogata, presumably, was on Okino's side
[4:08:14] <+0neReeler> ogata + izumi
[4:08:15] <%Weeewer> YOURE MISSING AN EXPLOSION
[4:08:19] <gamria> Ogata opposed PRIOR to the plague, but wanted it DURING the plague
[4:08:20] <thebalticguy1> Izumi starts the shootout
[4:08:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Ogata changed sides
[4:08:22] <RacistWakka> Ogata changed his mind
[4:08:26] <halfmasks> ogata was for the ark project but he killed out of revenge
[4:08:27] <mortificent> Ogata changed his mind
[4:08:27] <%Weeewer> there was an explosion started by Ei
[4:08:30] <%SouLucha> Ogata was against the project before shit hit the fan.
[4:08:30] <Monkeyweed21> Ogata escalated by pulling out a gun
[4:08:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Izumi and Ogata were on team Ark, then? From the looks of this
[4:08:32] <+Unajer> Okino changes his mind, Ogata also changed his mind
[4:08:36] <+JacknZack27> Ogata wasn’t opposed anymore
[4:08:37] <Riorii> this isnt really explained as far as im aware
[4:08:37] <%Aceofstaves> OGATA CHANGED HIS MIND AS HUMANITY'S SITUATION GOT WORSE
[4:08:39] <alphalejandro> Ogata change
[4:08:42] <IndoorSitup> Ogata changed his mind
[4:08:43] <%Kriss1827> ogata changes his mind
[4:08:43] <+Jaromero435> They switch stances
[4:08:45] <%Weeewer> THE EXPLOSION
[4:08:49] <CappuccinoGuil> A gun, Woolie
[4:08:50] <MyNameIsRasus> OGATA CHANGED SIDES
[4:08:50] <%Amaideus> It doesn't matter if OGata changes his mind
[4:08:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Theres nothing that said ogata changed
[4:08:59] <+BigCoffee> @r_xanadu When Kengo talks to Gouto to shit talk him. Gouto sees the pod isn't out of range yet and finds someone who can make the change. The last person he talks too is Ida, who probably does the changes
[4:08:59] <%ZweihanderSteve> Juro probably wanted to save the life support for megumi
[4:09:00] <DubiousRhino> Juro wanted to continue the plan for Morimura's sake
[4:09:01] <Blank9> ogata brought a gun
[4:09:01] <%Amaideus> Punchmom gets it
[4:09:02] <+0neReeler> life support battle ends the colony
[4:09:02] <%kyh9> Ogata changed his mind I guess
[4:09:04] <+jiggy_snipe> it seems like it's just a chaotic time
[4:09:05] <%Amaideus> It's literally that simple
[4:09:05] <+HazZe16> remember papa ogata said everyone wanted project ark because humanity was gonna end
[4:09:06] <halfmasks> punchmom right
[4:09:06] <+Zasne> CORRECT
[4:09:09] <%dkzk21> THATS EXACTLY IT.
[4:09:09] <Blank9> without announcing it
[4:09:09] <Monkeyweed21> Juro was pro ark, Ogata just escalated shit
[4:09:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yes
[4:09:10] <TukeArt> Ogata started shootout, Juro killed Okino (who was on ogatas side)
[4:09:10] <+Dachillin> yes
[4:09:15] <sketchpixels> okina wanted life support ogata and everyone else wanted the project
[4:09:16] <RacistWakka> Ogata didnt care at first before shit hitting the fan
[4:09:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Punch mom is right
[4:09:18] <%Seancicle> heard it thru the 🍇 vine
[4:09:19] <%AMUSERNAME> SASUGA, PUNCHMOM PogChamp
[4:09:22] <%doombawkzvs> Ogata changes his mind like the morally grey individual he is
[4:09:25] <+Zasne> BRAINMOM
[4:09:25] <MyNameIsRasus> BRAIN MOM
[4:09:27] <+Sp3ctre48> Okino wanted to cancel the plan, Juro was on Morimura's side who wanted Project Ark to continue
[4:09:29] <cizal11> It’s not clear what happened with ogata, but he came with dudes and guns ready to force his plan
[4:09:30] <halfmasks> BRAIN MOM
[4:09:30] <%Livelinne> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[4:09:40] <sketchpixels> BIG BRAIN MOM
[4:09:44] <+0neReeler> oof
[4:09:50] <Monkeyweed21> Ogata escalated it from a debate to a shootout @WoolieVersus
[4:09:51] <+JacknZack27> This lady is smart. She should be here more often
[4:09:54] <%SouLucha> It is possible we don't have enough information from 2188, we learn the most important bits, but we don't see the whole story.
[4:09:56] <+Sp3ctre48> We cant say what happens with Ogata, but the man bringing a gun to the situation probably escalated the situation
[4:09:57] <%baka_sugoi> then GUN
[4:10:00] <%Weeewer> Brain mom!!!!
[4:10:05] <+jiggy_snipe> it was just talk until Ogata showed up with guns
[4:10:06] <%AMUSERNAME> Keyword being "COME ARMED" PogChamp
[4:10:09] <+Zasne> YES!!!!
[4:10:13] <+skyheys> yes
[4:10:15] <+Zasne> THIS IS IT
[4:10:15] <%Irridium> start blastin'
[4:10:16] <RacistWakka> Man I would love to watch a prequel anime
[4:10:24] <OblivionSword1> and then there's the explosion happened
[4:10:25] <%Weeewer> I’d LOVE an anime
[4:10:32] <%Aceofstaves> THE EXPLOSION
[4:10:34] <%kyh9> Izumi is pro-plan, Okino is anti-plan
[4:10:37] <%cvp5127> "so i started blastin"
[4:10:38] <%Amaideus> Because Juro is loyal to Morimura
[4:10:39] <+jiggy_snipe> it was chaos Woolie, everyone was shooting Kappa
[4:10:40] <Blank9> people aren't lined up by position in a board room
[4:10:41] <+Jaromero435> "If that damn Ogata and his cronies hadn't come armed" Doesn't 100% mean they were against Okino/Hijiyama
[4:10:42] <cizal11> Because izumi wants the plan to succeed period
[4:10:43] <corinv> Izumi was just pro ark
[4:10:43] <%Amaideus> And Okino is anti plan
[4:10:44] <irfan_> because okino was opposed to the plan
[4:10:46] <+0neReeler> ogata is shikishima boss, so yea armed goons
[4:10:48] <%Amaideus> So Izumi shoots Okino
[4:10:49] <%Weeewer> The anime could go any direction through the story, but I’d love to see the action scenes and expanded prequel stuff
[4:10:49] <TukeArt> Okino and Ogata are both anti plan
[4:10:49] <+Zasne> Izumi wasn't a "crony". It became a Mexican Standoff BECAUSE of Ogata's cronies having guns.
[4:10:50] <+Buffalo36> Izumi is loyal to the plan
[4:10:50] <%Livelinne> Mmm watcha saaay moment but without the humor
[4:10:54] <DubiousRhino> Izumi saw everyone turning against the plan, and decided to shoot to save the plan for Morimura
[4:10:54] <%gatorafan> So anyway I started blasting
[4:10:55] <sketchpixels> Izumi promised to protect megumi
[4:10:56] <%kyh9> Izumi is pro-ark, Okino is pro-life-support, Ogata escalated it all
[4:10:57] <Monkeyweed21> Ogata escalated shit from a debate to a shooutout @WoolieVersus
[4:10:57] <%SouLucha> It's more like Izumi was pro-plan, and Okino was pro-life...
[4:10:58] <pixel_river> id take atleast 2 seasons for this shit
[4:11:02] <r_xanadu> @BigCoffee So, Ida messed up Kengo's clone, and Nenji got mad? I'm so confused
[4:11:03] <thesilverbard> I think Izumi was personally invested in the ark because of his relationship with Morimura
[4:11:04] <%SouLucha> Ugh.
[4:11:09] <cizal11> Okino is essentially advocating for the end of humanity
[4:11:11] <%Weeewer> Izumi is a MAJOR. He is an army man
[4:11:11] <reonome> so anyway i started blasting
[4:11:15] <+skyheys> HAVE YOU SEEN JURO
[4:11:16] <%dkzk21> TAKATOSHI IS JUST BLAMING OGATA FOR BRINGING PEOPLE ARMED.
[4:11:22] <+skyheys> he shoots everyone!
[4:11:22] <%Weeewer> Army men bend to order
[4:11:22] <+sombraxyz> maybe he shot at someone else, but Okino jump in
[4:11:31] <RacistWakka> Izumi is very violent
[4:11:33] <+BlueJoneleth> maybe team Ogata started to shoot at Izumi, he shot back and Okino got hit by a straight bullet?
[4:11:34] <+BigCoffee> @r_xanadu No, Neenji was just mad because he didnt want life support to fuck up the ark
[4:11:43] <%osaka_daioh> It's a blind shootout.
[4:11:46] <+Unajer> Izumi just starts blastin. Kids, Adults, it don't matter
[4:11:49] <+skyheys> punch mom got it
[4:11:52] <%dkzk21> IZUMI LOVES MORIMURA AND IS SUPER INVESTED IN THE PROJECT
[4:11:53] <HeroToxiko> IT WAS A FIREFIGHT
[4:11:54] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus Look at the whole timeline and see when that convo took place in relevance to Ei's explosion.
[4:11:55] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[4:11:56] <sketchpixels> @WoolieVersus Izumi has morimura and megumi to protect
[4:12:00] <+Unajer> genetically predisposed to blast
[4:12:02] <%Irridium> it doesn't say he did it intentionally or not. could have been bullets started flying and Izumi ended up hitting Okino
[4:12:05] <+0neReeler> 6 other deaths
[4:12:05] <%Amaideus> Hijiyama doesn't have all the info woolie
[4:12:09] <%Amaideus> This is a biased account
[4:12:10] <+Zasne> Yes, Ogata started it all
[4:12:11] <alphalejandro> Juro is in love with Morimura, Morimura was pro ARK and Okino wanted more life suport, at that moment Juro choose his lover project over Okino pleas
[4:12:15] <+jiggy_snipe> bullets were flying
[4:12:16] <%dkzk21> PLUS MORIMURA IS SET TO BE DOWNLOADED INTO HER CLONE AND BE THE LEADER.
[4:12:18] <%Aceofstaves> Ogata came armed to save humanity's future
[4:12:19] <%Amaideus> Characters are mistaken
[4:12:21] <%SouLucha> Woolie, tensions are high as the last humans.
[4:12:22] <Blank9> ogata pulled a gun, but izumi kills with no hesitation and doesn't use intimidation
[4:12:26] <gamria> During the plague, Ogata supports Project Ark, so Izumi is on his side. Okino never liked Project Ark
[4:12:38] <halfmasks> it was a "everyone sucks here, even at the end of humanity"
[4:12:45] <%dkzk21> HE IS THINKING ABOUT MORIMURA AND PROJECT ARK AT ALL COSTS.
[4:12:46] <%Weeewer> These are 2188 versions
[4:12:48] <+Zasne> CROSSFIRE
[4:13:01] <+Jaromero435> Humanity vs Us
[4:13:02] <%Weeewer> He’s a simp bro it’s ez
[4:13:03] <%Kriss1827> explosion is 100% reason why everyone was on edge and why shit escalated to that degree
[4:13:04] <irfan_> we dont *really* know the truth, so we can only piece together with the pieces we have
[4:13:05] <%SouLucha> Really, Ryoko probably had good reason to believe humanity sucked.
[4:13:08] <+jiggy_snipe> well Izumi and Morimura did have a relationship
[4:13:08] <DubiousRhino> Ogata was pro-ARK, Okino was anti-ARK, Juro was working for Ogata
[4:13:10] <Savior127> @WoolieVersus If the explosion took place roughly at the same time during the meeting then it could've been done out of sheer panic
[4:13:10] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[4:13:12] <+JacknZack27> It was a chaotic shootout
[4:13:13] <RacistWakka> Prequel anime!!!!!
[4:13:14] <+Zasne> "So I started blasting!" lmao
[4:13:16] <%cvp5127> GUNSLINGER
[4:13:16] <%Amaideus> Ah
[4:13:26] <halfmasks> it was tits up from the get imo
[4:13:27] <%Weeewer> RAIN STORM
[4:13:31] <HeroToxiko> skyhDAD exactly
[4:13:33] <cizal11> Okino wanted to end the project. Juro, who already was setting up memory transplants and shit, is very much for the project.
[4:13:39] <Charbic> So I switched to Gunslinger
[4:13:39] <+justianxix> Trick shot
[4:13:41] <%AMUSERNAME> Woolie, I'm sure you understand already, but why do you think Okino was the FIRST one shot??
[4:13:41] <chaos2frozen> Woolie thinks Okino is the catalysis? We don't know that
[4:13:41] <+Unajer> remember that the bomb Sekigahara sets off means they don't have enough power for both life support and project ARK. This would change people's tunes
[4:13:41] <thesilverbard> This is a situation where almost all the remaining members of the colony died, there probably wasn't a lot of logical decisionmaking over who to shoot
[4:13:43] <RacistWakka> We need a prequel anime
[4:13:45] <OblivionSword1> who fire the first shot ?
[4:13:46] <r_xanadu> @BigCoffee So, Nenji wanted his clone to get maintained via Project Ark?
[4:13:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Juro was very much for project
[4:13:55] <soflicar> makes me wonder who killed the kid megumi
[4:13:55] <%cvp5127> we need a stage play LUL
[4:14:06] <halfmasks> Was okino even the first one shot tho?
[4:14:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:07] <+skyheys> people are complex
[4:14:08] <%Amaideus> @r_xanadu Yeah, more or less
[4:14:09] <+BigCoffee> @r_xanadu yeah, and okino wanted more into life support
[4:14:12] <%Irridium> who knows how much you can change in one year at the end of humanity
[4:14:13] <cizal11> We do know, 2188 okino sucks
[4:14:16] <+Zasne> It's honestly unclear. We lack exact details
[4:14:18] <+JacknZack27> We dont know who shot first
[4:14:23] <Monkeyweed21> Ogata escalated a debate to a death fight
[4:14:27] <+Jaromero435> Han shot first
[4:14:30] <%uoblivion> yeah, all we have are logs
[4:14:32] <+skyheys> maybe juro hates men
[4:14:33] <TukeArt> I doubt Juro shot first
[4:14:34] <cizal11> We don’t know who shot first
[4:14:36] <pixel_river> This is like 10 MGS2 in 1
[4:14:37] <%dkzk21> Its also no stated that he shot first.
[4:14:38] <%Irridium> he didn't say he shot first, just that he shot Okino
[4:14:39] <RacistWakka> We dont know if he did
[4:14:46] <%kyh9> Izumi or OGata shot first, we don't know that Okino died first
[4:14:48] <%Weeewer> We only know 2 things about Juro Izumi 2188????
[4:14:50] <Blank9> ogata is a punk that would use a gun to intimidate, izumi is a military guy who will kill ANYONE to accomplish his goals
[4:14:52] <+JacknZack27> We dont know
[4:14:52] <%Amaideus> It's easiest to assume Juro shot first because Okino did some action that would've got in the way of the plan
[4:14:53] <%Weeewer> What do you mean
[4:14:54] <thesilverbard> Who killed Megumi, the child?
[4:14:56] <+justianxix> MCCLUNKY
[4:14:56] <DubiousRhino> Everyone keeps talking about this as a "debate" when it was literally about whether everyone lives or dies. It wasn't a debate. It was life or death.
[4:14:57] <LycheeMusings> Juro Han Solo Izumi
[4:14:57] <%baka_sugoi> A N I M E
[4:15:02] <+Zasne> We have to ask Kamitani himself
[4:15:05] <OblivionSword1> 1
[4:15:10] <mortificent> 1
[4:15:11] <jorniev> HAN SOLO
[4:15:12] <%SouLucha> Do we really want to watch the last moments of the last horrible humans left alive as they come to terms with the horrors of going extinct?
[4:15:12] <+jiggy_snipe> well he died
[4:15:12] <%osaka_daioh> Where did that come from XD
[4:15:14] <%Amaideus> The mystery of the final mystery point
[4:15:15] <Triplicat> just gets into meta-chips next battle
[4:15:18] <OblivionSword1> 1 whole point
[4:15:19] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Read the Q&A by the devs
[4:15:23] <%cvp5127> coolest guy
[4:15:23] <chaos2frozen> That mystery point will be converted to metachips when you complete the next battle
[4:15:31] <quietshun> He got brought back and was made to remake the sectors
[4:15:32] <corinv> He was setting back up the sim
[4:15:34] <Blank9> team life support all the way, if you live then you can make the ark later
[4:15:35] <+jiggy_snipe> everyone is back so why wouldn't he be back
[4:15:38] <%Amaideus> This has to be an AI version
[4:15:38] <+Dachillin> coolest guy
[4:15:39] <%Irridium> He's bringing all the sectors back
[4:15:41] <BanquoViaquo> He repairs the virtual sectors for everyone.
[4:15:42] <cizal11> Ida is the one who brought the sectors back
[4:15:46] <+Zasne> When they restart the simulation he came back
[4:15:47] <%Aceofstaves> he's in UC in sector 3
[4:15:47] <%Weeewer> This is after the 5 year time skip I think
[4:15:51] <Savior127> Wait, whats Dawn?
[4:15:52] <+Unajer> his atonement is to fix up all the sectors
[4:15:54] <+jiggy_snipe> and he's been fixing all the sectors
[4:15:58] <DubiousRhino> He's an AI version that was stored in sector 0. He's atoning for everything he did by restoring the sectors.
[4:16:01] <%cvp5127> no consequences
[4:16:07] <%Amaideus> He's Orochimaru-ing @WoolieVersus
[4:16:08] <%kyh9> She still liked him
[4:16:13] <%SouLucha> ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL
[4:16:13] <Blank9> she loves him
[4:16:14] <RacistWakka> She liked him
[4:16:17] <%kyh9> @Amaideus Literally this
[4:16:18] <+jiggy_snipe> he's fixing all the sectors and they were in love
[4:16:19] <CappuccinoGuil> You've gotta remember: Inaba and Ida DID love each other
[4:16:19] <%cvp5127> coolest guy
[4:16:21] <+skyheys> NOBODY DIED
[4:16:22] <reonome> HAPPY END
[4:16:23] <%AMUSERNAME> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[4:16:24] <+JacknZack27> She loves him
[4:16:24] <aiwass8> Izumi was for “let grannymura overwrite her clone” plan, he was not saint
[4:16:25] <%Weeewer> Now that the war is over, time for flirting
[4:16:26] <Lancaster_H> weirdly being flirty with the guy she loved wow
[4:16:26] <RacistWakka> But he was being an ass
[4:16:27] <Blank9> he's not doing his evil stuff anymore
[4:16:27] <Triplicat> SEASIDE VACATION
[4:16:29] <MyNameIsRasus> SourPls
[4:16:30] <%kyh9> He was the HOTTEST guy
[4:16:32] <+0neReeler> it all ended ok
[4:16:33] <+JacknZack27> He said sorry
[4:16:35] <%AMUSERNAME> SourPls
[4:16:36] <%Weeewer> The war is over now
[4:16:36] <%kyh9> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WOOLIE
[4:16:39] <TukeArt> AI Tomi has bad taste
[4:16:39] <reonome> just leave seaside vacation playing pls
[4:16:41] <reonome> SourPls
[4:16:42] <%cvp5127> yes
[4:16:44] <%kyh9> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND THE IDA-DICK
[4:16:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[4:16:44] <Althallos> Hijiyama’s favourite food was initially going to be yakisoba like Kabamaru’s, but the game’s system made it so that it had to be food that could be eaten with one hand, which resulted in it being changed to yakisoba-pan.
[4:16:45] <alphalejandro> Ida Uchiha over here
[4:16:46] <thesilverbard> The rebirth of humanity is a good reason for a general amnesty
[4:16:49] <%ZweihanderSteve> she loves him, and then he became chill
[4:16:49] <RacistWakka> Pretty much
[4:16:49] <%Irridium> He didn't have all the facts when he was doing what he did
[4:16:49] <+justianxix> Some Padme shit
[4:16:50] <%Kriss1827> yep
[4:16:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, wouldn't you be sad if the person you loved dearly went down the wrong path in life?
[4:16:51] <pixel_river> SourPls
[4:16:53] <gamria> 5 years later, the Simulation was reset to right before the Kaiju disaster. Through everything, Inaba never stopped loving Ida
[4:16:53] <%kyh9> THE IDA DICK WHIFF
[4:16:55] <reonome> IDA DICK
[4:16:55] <%baka_sugoi> forgiveness
[4:16:55] <%Amaideus> Ida dick's game is stronk
[4:16:57] <+skyheys> now hes not being evil and nothing bad happened
[4:16:58] <jubejube56> If he had known that looping wasn't possible he likely would have changed his tune anyways
[4:16:58] <+jiggy_snipe> it literally doesn't matter cuz everything can be fixed
[4:16:58] <MyNameIsRasus> IDA DICK
[4:17:00] <%kyh9> Tomi is the type to forgive
[4:17:01] <DatAsuna> japan
[4:17:02] <%JustToWatch> HE WAS HOT THOUGH
[4:17:02] <%Weeewer> IDA DICK SUPER GOOD
[4:17:02] <rReizs> NO MUST KILL EVERYONE
[4:17:04] <+Zasne> His dick is MASSIVE
[4:17:04] <MyNameIsRasus> RIBBED FOR HER PLEASURE
[4:17:04] <mass1997> apparently in an interview it's been confirmed she "scolded" him
[4:17:04] <+0neReeler> For LOVE
[4:17:05] <jfp4life> JAPAN LOVES FORGIVENESS
[4:17:05] <%Amaideus> Though actually
[4:17:06] <LycheeMusings> THE ONLY THING I NEED IS YOU!!!
[4:17:08] <RacistWakka> What did IDA do?
[4:17:08] <%SouLucha> Well, not quite... It does seem like Tomi chews him out.
[4:17:08] <Monkeyweed21> Ida repaired the sectors as atonement @WoolieVersus
[4:17:08] <pantypan> @woolieversus I think you're missing a bonus objective in one of the fights, thus the extra point
[4:17:10] <r_xanadu> @BigCoffee ok. Still wondering why Okino would be against Project Ark despite contributing so much to the project. I know he just wants his himbo, but that doesn't explain why he'd be so ready to throw it all away like that
[4:17:10] <corinv> But that dick tho
[4:17:10] <turbofolk> oh god woolie please just let it slide
[4:17:12] <%Mrbaconator> COOLEST GUY
[4:17:13] <%AMUSERNAME> TETSUYA IDA UCHIHA
[4:17:13] <Triplicat> only inaba forgave him technically
[4:17:13] <+Jaromero435> Morally Gray
[4:17:14] <chaos2frozen> In George's interview, she lectured him for a long time lol
[4:17:17] <Triplicat> everyone else could still hate him
[4:17:19] <%SouLucha> Ida did say, he thought she would hate him.
[4:17:21] <cizal11> He didn’t actually kill anyone in the end lol, even if he made things real annoying
[4:17:22] <%Amaideus> Is this reset the kids do a new "loop" entirely?
[4:17:30] <RacistWakka> Forreal? What did he do?
[4:17:31] <%Amaideus> Because if it is then Ida wouldn't have done any of that fucked shit
[4:17:34] <+Zasne> everyone got Good End
[4:17:42] <%baka_sugoi> before the conflict
[4:17:48] <rReizs> he gave up when Ei told him about how the facility is about to break
[4:17:49] <Triplicat> except for nenji's father fuck that guy LUL
[4:17:50] <%cvp5127> you get a happy ending
[4:17:56] <+jiggy_snipe> they just rebuilt to before the final battle
[4:18:00] <chaos2frozen> this is before the invasion
[4:18:02] <Savior127> @Amaideus talking about the "last" loop?
[4:18:02] <cizal11> Even the whole dd426 thing isn’t super relevant once they’re out of the simulation
[4:18:05] <+Unajer> He's helping to rebuild.
[4:18:07] <%Weeewer> Mo
[4:18:08] <xbb1024> his data was backed up
[4:18:09] <%cvp5127> no
[4:18:09] <%Weeewer> No
[4:18:09] <mass1997> no
[4:18:10] <sketchpixels> no
[4:18:10] <cizal11> ????
[4:18:11] <%Amaideus> No wait, he knows about what he did
[4:18:11] <%baka_sugoi> NO
[4:18:12] <+jiggy_snipe> no
[4:18:13] <%SouLucha> No.
[4:18:14] <%ZweihanderSteve> ida brought all sectors back online
[4:18:14] <DubiousRhino> nah Ida was backed up to Sector 0, he knows everything that happened
[4:18:14] <jubejube56> NNO
[4:18:15] <reonome> NO
[4:18:15] <%Amaideus> So this Ida has to be the backup
[4:18:16] <%Miles_Hikari> He's helping the kids rebuild
[4:18:18] <%cvp5127> they rollbacked
[4:18:18] <%kyh9> Not a restart, it's the same one they left
[4:18:18] <CappuccinoGuil> they brought him back and he's atoning for his mistakes
[4:18:19] <sketchpixels> what???
[4:18:20] <+DontMindMee> they rolled back to before the attacks
[4:18:21] <%Aceofstaves> No, this idea helping to set up the world again from inside
[4:18:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Confusion seems like the theme of this game
[4:18:23] <r_xanadu> Also, when did Miyuki Inaba's and her song get introduced to 1985? Was 2188 Tomi also a singer?
[4:18:24] <+JacknZack27> He’s helping to rebuild as redemption
[4:18:24] <+jiggy_snipe> they just fixed everything
[4:18:27] <+Buffalo36> He's helping to bring the sectors back for the group
[4:18:27] <%Amaideus> They go back in 5 years later
[4:18:28] <%kyh9> @cvp5127 Literally Rollback netcode
[4:18:29] <Revkyuu> no, he backed up his data
[4:18:31] <%Irridium> he's restoring the sectors
[4:18:31] <RacistWakka> This was a backup Ida
[4:18:32] <%Miles_Hikari> Same one that got destroid, he is helping rebuild
[4:18:32] <Blank9> he's cleaning up the simulation
[4:18:33] <%AMUSERNAME> Backup to save-state, but with knowledge of all the scumbaggery
[4:18:33] <%Amaideus> To a point before the fighting started
[4:18:33] <+Dragon4234> @WoolieVersus He backed up his data from his last encounter
[4:18:34] <OblivionSword1> I think he help rebuild the curreent simulation
[4:18:35] <rReizs> no he is helping them to restore all the sectors after they are shut down
[4:18:35] <%kyh9> ROLLBACK NETCODE SAVED THE DAY
[4:18:38] <%Weeewer> This is after they’ve gotten out
[4:18:38] <Monkeyweed21> he fixed every sector
[4:18:39] <%baka_sugoi> yes
[4:18:43] <+Unajer> atonement.
[4:18:45] <%cvp5127> revived everyone
[4:18:45] <%doombawkzvs> The Ark has the best rollback netcode
[4:18:46] <%SouLucha> Lol, Rollback.
[4:18:47] <+skyheys> he wasnt dead at that point so hes cool
[4:18:48] <+Jaromero435> They rolled back and then fixed everything with their new knowledge
[4:18:50] <%kyh9> ROLLBACK NETCODE SAVED MIWAKO
[4:18:50] <RacistWakka> He's bringing MIWAKO BACK
[4:18:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Redemption arc
[4:18:54] <cizal11> And ida is the one rolling them back, being one of the only ones capable
[4:18:56] <Triplicat> system restore point activated
[4:19:00] <%ZweihanderSteve> ida saved 1.2 million virtual people
[4:19:01] <thesilverbard> not start of the loop, about 15 years into the loop
[4:19:01] <chaos2frozen> LMAO rollback netcode
[4:19:02] <Monkeyweed21> Ida's the one that fixed the simulation
[4:19:03] <%baka_sugoi> ROLLBACK NETCODE
[4:19:04] <khetrak> Woolie, i just got here from the vods, i haven't watched everything yet, but the fact that this game didn't get the narrative/story of the year award in the game show is a sin.
[4:19:04] <+Rolandknight> It’s five years and they turn it back on
[4:19:08] <%SouLucha> Omg, this really could be rollback netcode...
[4:19:09] <%Irridium> THAT ROLLBACK NETCODE
[4:19:09] <%Aceofstaves> No
[4:19:13] <mass1997> no
[4:19:14] <zhenthrim213> THE MYSTICAL ROLLBACK
[4:19:16] <+Buffalo36> No LUL
[4:19:18] <alphalejandro> a world pre kaiju attacks and with no more Kaiju attacks
[4:19:18] <CappuccinoGuil> REDEMPTION
[4:19:19] <Revkyuu> Chiriro backed up all the peoples data
[4:19:20] <RacistWakka> MIWAKO BACK everything is forgiven
[4:19:20] <%Amaideus> Nah it's still backup data Ida
[4:19:21] <%osaka_daioh> THAT ROLLBACK NETCODE
[4:19:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so wait did only the ai from sector 4 get backed up?
[4:19:22] <%kyh9> ITS ROLLBACK NETCODE, ON THE ENTIRE WORLD SERVER
[4:19:22] <%cvp5127> before the attack
[4:19:23] <DubiousRhino> No Ida knows everything! He stored himself in Sector 0!
[4:19:24] <%Amaideus> Because he knows he fucked up
[4:19:27] <Althallos> @khetrak The fact it wasn't event nominated for art direction
[4:19:30] <+jiggy_snipe> he rolled it back
[4:19:31] <+JacknZack27> Ida knows everything
[4:19:31] <%Miles_Hikari> He is helping Rebuild, hes trying to atone
[4:19:34] <%SouLucha> LUL LUL LUL
[4:19:36] <%Amaideus> He already had a backup of his current version in sector 0
[4:19:37] <%Aceofstaves> it's just a rollback to prior to the final battle and a restoration of the sectors
[4:19:38] <DubiousRhino> He's just seeking forgiveness for his actions & he's restoring the sectors, so Inaba forgives him
[4:19:40] <alrobot2014> look at the line at the bottom of the screen he knows what's happened
[4:19:42] <%Amaideus> So this is an AI backup
[4:19:42] <%kyh9> ITS A PREVIOUS STATE
[4:19:42] <lem______> Should someone tell woolie the time?
[4:19:44] <CappuccinoGuil> This Ida is the one that fucked everything up, he's atoning
[4:19:51] <cizal11> He did upload his older self
[4:19:58] <Monkeyweed21> Ida is helping Miyuki rebuild the sectors to atone
[4:19:59] <zolitus> He realized before he got shot that he misunderstood the entire situation
[4:20:01] <jubejube56> Yeah when does the curfew start?
[4:20:11] <+Dachillin> He realized looping would work
[4:20:16] <%Amaideus> @zolitus But that was a version of him that didn't get backed up,
[4:20:16] <rReizs> during the mexican standoff with Ei he gave up
[4:20:24] <%Amaideus> So that can't be this version
[4:20:26] <Blank9> he just wants his data to the command ship with her after he fixes the simulation
[4:20:27] <RacistWakka> She probably fell for him cause Shu
[4:20:29] <CappuccinoGuil> She was sad because her love was turning evil
[4:20:32] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus before he was shot as an android he realized how hard he fucked up
[4:20:34] <%Amaideus> The android one that gets shot by Ei I mean
[4:20:34] <Savior127> So do all the Sectors go through time simultaneously or is it one at a time? Because we saw two of the same AI at different time periods
[4:20:41] <+jiggy_snipe> she was always in love with him
[4:20:42] <%Miles_Hikari> He is helping the kids rebuild Woolie
[4:20:44] <%cvp5127> she forgave him
[4:20:44] <alphalejandro> Is after 5 years
[4:20:48] <+JustBlubs> Basically even AI want the future dick
[4:20:53] <zolitus> but it was a version before the kaiju attack which they went back to
[4:20:56] <+BigCoffee> @Savior127 all at the same time
[4:20:56] <CappuccinoGuil> All events after Dawn are 5 years later
[4:20:57] <+JacknZack27> Its five years later
[4:20:57] <Lancaster_H> he thought he was doing the rational thing about the big picture in addition to the clone tomi bullshit
[4:20:58] <RacistWakka> Tamao isnt AI
[4:21:00] <%kyh9> ROLLBACK NETCODE
[4:21:05] <Monkeyweed21> Ida helped fix the sectors to make it up to Miyuki
[4:21:09] <%cvp5127> yes
[4:21:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[4:21:11] <%kyh9> OKINO PROGRAMMED THE SECTORS WITH ROLLBACK NETCODE
[4:21:14] <+skyheys> coorrect
[4:21:14] <Blank9> juro says that
[4:21:15] <+jiggy_snipe> @RacistWakka one of them is
[4:21:17] <%dkzk21> He is helping the kids rebuild to right before the attack.
[4:21:17] <+justianxix> R O L L B A C K
[4:21:19] <%Lion_kun> Lolimura
[4:21:29] <+jiggy_snipe> @RacistWakka well a different ai like Inaba and BJ
[4:21:35] <RacistWakka> Theres android Tamao and real Tamao whos clone
[4:21:38] <+JustBlubs> Essentially even though he was a villain he wasn't mallicious. He didn't know it was the last loop till the end
[4:21:42] <chaos2frozen> you would hope the year 2188 rollback netcode would be commonly used in Japan
[4:21:45] <%Amaideus> Man, now I'm happy they didn't try and blitz the ending before
[4:21:46] <+Ominnous> !guest
[4:21:50] <+Ominnous> !who
[4:21:52] <%Amaideus> This discussion's been great
[4:21:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @kyh9 tecnically the devs of mighty kaiju deimos did that Kappa
[4:21:57] <reonome> SourPls
[4:22:02] <+jiggy_snipe> hey can people see Shiba now
[4:22:05] <r_xanadu> Is the satellite Inaba in located in the real world? Always assumed it was part of the simulation for whatever reason
[4:22:05] <+jiggy_snipe> ?
[4:22:13] <%Amaideus> @r_xanadu Yes
[4:22:18] <+Unajer> yeah, his data is in UC so people cans ee him
[4:22:20] <Althallos> @r_xanadu Yeah
[4:22:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> satellite is real

[4:22:29] <Triplicat> S ranks
[4:22:29] <%osaka_daioh> That Rollback Netcode
[4:22:29] <DubiousRhino> Ida is in charge of UC and he's the one ensuring that the simulation stays normal
[4:22:32] <DatAsuna> not delay based
[4:22:33] <%Aceofstaves> @jiggy_snipe yes, yakushiji talks to him in that scene
[4:22:34] <RacistWakka> Good question can people see Kyuta?

[4:27:06] <Monkeyweed21> Ei Sekigahara killed Morimura before she could set up the memory transfers, Juro Izumi only set up her transfer, which means Kengo Ogata never got transferred over and ended up dying. Thus Ei saved humanity

[4:28:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's her boss
[4:28:25] <irfan_> she was seeking advice
[4:28:26] <+fetrigon> probably unsure of herself
[4:28:26] <TukeArt> Kengo started the project, Morimura respected him
[4:28:26] <%Amaideus> She didn't, she was just acting like she was
[4:28:27] <%Livelinne> woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:28:27] <pixel_river> LUL

[4:28:29] <+0ni0n_L0rd> She wanted advice! She said so herself.
[4:28:29] <corinv> Morimura made the AI to steal funds for her projects
[4:28:30] <sketchpixels> He was her boss
[4:28:32] <+Jaromero435> Future Dick? LUL
[4:28:33] <Qu1ckyyy> money
[4:28:34] <+Zasne> Morimura was using the AI for money connections
[4:28:34] <KeroKamina> MONEY
[4:28:35] <%Amaideus> She wanted the credentials
[4:28:35] <Monkeyweed21> He stroked her ego after she lost her company @WoolieVersus
[4:28:36] <+JacknZack27> Money
[4:28:37] <+jiggy_snipe> it was her boss technically
[4:28:38] <%SouLucha> DAMN KARMA HOUDINI

[4:28:46] <%ZweihanderSteve> pity
[4:28:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @rosemon5001
[4:28:46] <%baka_sugoi> FUNDING
[4:28:47] <Blank9> to know his money connections
[4:28:47] <jubejube56> She tried to use him to get the funding to keep Project Ark afloat
[4:28:48] <KeroKamina> USING HIS BANK ACCOUNT
[4:28:48] <+JacknZack27> She needed cash fast
[4:28:50] <%AndrewRoivas> Maybe funding?
[4:28:50] <+fetrigon> Needs something outside of herself for reassurance
[4:28:51] <OrpheusXP> Those last 2% are going to annoy me so bad :(
[4:28:51] <%Amaideus> But he has the money
[4:28:56] <gamria> Gouto and Nenji cut Morimura's funding, so she turned to Kengo for connections for funding
[4:28:57] <Arweynn> Maybe he was the one who kept Interstellar operating after it was 'canceled'?
[4:28:57] <jubejube56> As she said "I was just getting advice"
[4:28:59] <KeroKamina> IT WAS LITERALLY FOR FUNDING
[4:29:00] <+Zasne> basically using his signature
[4:29:01] <%Amaideus> And the access privilege's
[4:29:04] <%Livelinne> songcoMoneyGun songcoMoarmoney
[4:29:15] <+Unajer> I don't think Morimura was in on Kengo's bodysnatching plan
[4:29:15] <HeroToxiko> she 6th dayed him
[4:29:15] <+Jaromero435> Bank accounts shouldn't matter with 15 people left LUL
[4:29:16] <rReizs> to finish project ark after the other bigwigs were against it
[4:29:19] <+Zasne> correct
[4:29:20] <%SkellyVee> YEPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
[4:29:20] <%SouLucha> Gotta screw over Humanity for the MONEY
[4:29:21] <%AMUSERNAME> SYNC TEST???
[4:29:23] <+jiggy_snipe> id locked bank accounts
[4:29:24] <%SkellyVee> YEPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
[4:29:28] <+0neReeler> ooh
[4:29:30] <+BigCoffee> It's not his money, it's his help to make funds + credentials
[4:29:34] <Blank9> it was REALLY screwed up corporate sketchy money to get to
[4:29:35] <Monkeyweed21> He stroked her ego after Gouto took her company away and egged her on to continue with Project Ark
[4:29:36] <khetrak> i just want to say, there will never be a game like this again, the note and whitebord for the writer team must be something else. its insane how many elements that can become a plot hole this game has and perfect the story.
[4:29:37] <arkv01> so what you're saying is bitcoin is going make us immortal
[4:29:37] <DedlokPM> woolieVS woolieVS_HF
[4:29:40] <%Amaideus> Kengo died, then she remakes him for MONEYY, then his AI copy releases the plague because of Gouto
[4:29:44] <+richardlikespies> hedge funds fucked us up NotLikeThis
[4:29:51] <Arweynn> Yeah, see 426 as to why DON'T REZ AI GHOSTS
[4:29:52] <TukeArt> I feel like Kengos role was cut from the story, he was supposed to be a bigger villain or something
[4:29:56] <Tuna_Can_0> time to put all that money into GME distSmile
[4:29:59] <%SouLucha> EAT THE RICH
[4:30:02] <%kyh9> GODDAMN THAT WAS GOOD

[4:36:07] <%Livelinne> psaWink
[4:36:10] <pixel_river> I cant write 2 percent of this
[4:36:12] <aiwass8> By himself
[4:36:15] <quietshun> Kamitani was pretty much only on the story for this game, others did the art for it
[4:36:21] <chaos2frozen> The writer is the director who is the artist lol
[4:36:21] <Monkeyweed21> GrimGrimoire?
[4:36:23] <mephium> I wish it won for story(?) at the TGA FeelsBadMan
[4:36:31] <DatAsuna> but also muramasa/dragon's crown are almost devoid of story
[4:36:41] <reonome> grimgrimoire best rts
[4:36:50] <%Amaideus> That would require those people to be able to comprehend this shit though @mephium
[4:36:54] <KaiserMario> Almost nobody remembers Grimgrimoire, but it's great too
[4:36:56] <%Amaideus> Asking a bit too much unfortunately
[4:36:57] <khetrak> how can someone play this and think last of us 2 has a better story
[4:37:01] <%baka_sugoi> HE TOLD HER THE TRUTH
[4:37:03] <%Aceofstaves> it should have won best narrative and should have arty least been a nominee for goty, but ya know, American games journalism
[4:37:06] <thesilverbard> So Kyuta Shiba's personality was tailored specifically to be someone Juro Kurabe would get along with. Does that mean asshole cat is Yakushiji's type?
[4:37:11] <reonome> they didn't play this, thats the problem
[4:37:12] <%AMUSERNAME> BOL

[4:41:20] <alrobot2014> only one Kengo to fuck it all
[4:41:22] <rosemon5001> what does this red button do?
[4:41:28] <%Amaideus> woolieONEGUY woolieGIRLS
[4:41:29] <DatAsuna> Tech and social development is not video game tech tree, it ain't linear.
[4:41:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Give Ryoko love
[4:41:34] <DatAsuna> But still, why risk it
[4:41:40] <+justianxix> but there s ALWAYS this ONE GUY, always
[4:41:40] <TheRamu99> what part are we on boys?
[4:41:42] <Blank9> it's like giving everyone a fully formed nuke capability
[4:41:44] <+JacknZack27> One Kengo
[4:41:46] <%MajkirM> woolieONEGUY
[4:41:53] <%RyTYoung> @theramu99 da end
[4:41:54] <%Amaideus> That's why they have infinite backups
[4:41:55] <%doombawkzvs> woolieONEGUY
[4:42:00] <+fetrigon> also takes another one guy to counter the bad actions of the one guy
[4:42:01] <Blank9> except watchmen
[4:42:03] <Iphantom99> yeah but Ozymandias was kinda right
[4:42:05] <alphalejandro> Ryoko Shinonome, the ONE GIRL
[4:42:06] <%Amaideus> Even when it happens on one planet, there's tons more
[4:42:10] <KaiserMario> MiB?
[4:42:18] <%baka_sugoi> the BASEMENT
[4:42:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:42:19] <Monkeyweed21> Imagine some guy making mechanical Covid
[4:42:23] <mortificent> We at Umbrella, we make benevolent pharmaceuticals
[4:42:25] <CappuccinoGuil> The one thing I still don't get though: were the kids the same age they were in the simulation when they left it? Or were they 20 (18 years + 2 years of training)
[4:42:28] <+JustBlubs> @DatAsuna Because it's too late. The nanomachines are in them no matter what. May as well teach them how to actively avoid it instead of having them ruin everything on accident.
[4:42:30] <+0neReeler> curiosity kills the cat
[4:42:41] <Triplicat> 6 million Sims
[4:42:45] <%Amaideus> @CappuccinoGuil The age they were when they won
[4:42:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so we have tamao to thank for miwako
[4:42:53] <Blank9> NPC meme come to life
[4:42:58] <chaos2frozen> everyone's a clone
[4:42:59] <+jiggy_snipe> @CappuccinoGuil I guess 16
[4:43:00] <Triplicat> tamao the ultimate fanfic writer
[4:43:01] <RacistWakka> Tamao big brain
[4:43:01] <%baka_sugoi> tamou with a dart board
[4:43:01] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna rhetorical question, see the message i put immediately before
[4:43:08] <%Amaideus> 2188 Shinonome's fuckery made the Kaiju come in years before they hit 18+2
[4:43:12] <Triplicat> tamao created woolie
[4:43:18] <jorniev> Just construct an AI that reads minds, so we can create a TRUE DEMOCRACY based on people experience while respecting everyone's individuality.
[4:43:19] <Blank9> they're clones that legit have NPC AI put into their brains
[4:43:20] <+BlueJoneleth> SO MIWAKO IS BASED ON A REAL HUMAN!!!!!
[4:43:21] <RacistWakka> Thanks Tamao for Miwako
[4:43:24] <pixel_river> CUT CONTENT
[4:43:34] <+BlueJoneleth> at least her dna
[4:43:37] <reonome> that would have been neat
[4:43:44] <CappuccinoGuil> OH FUCK THAT
[4:43:49] <%Amaideus> I want the Okino route tbh
[4:43:51] <alphalejandro> Gen 1 Sentinel for Woolie and Gen 3 Sentinel for Reggie
[4:43:53] <RacistWakka> I assumed Miwako was based on someone
[4:43:53] <CappuccinoGuil> That would've been TERRIBLE
[4:43:55] <mortificent> OOF
[4:44:00] <%Amaideus> But I guess that's a thing with the completion
[4:44:16] <%Amaideus> Was it when he was tied to the chair?
[4:44:17] <reonome> corrupted hijiyama would be some good shit
[4:44:18] <Monkeyweed21> poor little himbo
[4:44:21] <%baka_sugoi> feel for HIMBO
[4:44:21] <%Amaideus> Getting mindfucked by his crush?
[4:44:32] <%Livelinne> spaceyeenShock
[4:44:32] <RacistWakka> Hes agood boy
[4:44:34] <reonome> MINDFUCKED
[4:44:39] <Blank9> okino is the absolute worst
[4:44:42] <RacistWakka> He's Gonta
[4:44:50] <Iphantom99> Hijiyama could have been so bad but became an amazing character
[4:44:53] <alphalejandro> The only thing he gets is his love for Yakisoba
[4:44:57] <Triplicat> gonna get to okino in a couple questions here heh

[4:55:17] <%Amaideus> To be fair, that Ida wouldn't be anywhere near as monstrous when he has the singer with him
[4:55:18] <jubejube56> Ida's main issue seems to stem from him messing up and thinking that a "do-over" is possible.

[4:58:12] <alphalejandro> Babymura has a Miura now
[4:58:13] <jubejube56> Therefore I will copy your data and make it live in a simulation to prove if you are trustworthy, then kill the simulation and pull the original from sector 0

[4:59:12] <%SouLucha> God damn Lolicons!
[4:59:12] <reonome> she didn't do it on PURPOSE
[4:59:12] <Lancaster_H> THATS NOT THE SAME PERSON
[4:59:12] <alphalejandro> Was a mistake
[4:59:15] <%takutoots> nanomachines son
[4:59:18] <pixel_river> nanomachines son
[4:59:20] <aiwass8> humanity was not intended to kill humanity
[4:59:20] <%great_tj> Woolie will put Humanity in purgatory
[4:59:21] <irfan_> WOOLIE... IS THE COOLEST GUY
[4:59:22] <+JacknZack27> She had her reasons

[4:59:38] <DubiousRhino> Woolie's a cop!
[4:59:39] <aiwass8> morimura*
[4:59:40] <KeroKamina> ACCIDENT THO
[4:59:41] <GoldenGod0> It was a little fuckwy wucky
[4:59:42] <%SouLucha> ONE GOOD DEED IS GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT?
[4:59:45] <+skyheys> woolie is being a villain as we speak
[4:59:47] <+Havrik> She literally sold her nanos to the people who merc'd humanity for a quick buck!
[4:59:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Sounds like woolie wants to be a cop
[4:59:51] <Monkeyweed21> PAROLE IS NOT A FALSE PURGATORY
[4:59:53] <Qu1ckyyy> Woolie 426es AI's.
[4:59:53] <jorniev> reggie lives in a virtual reality made by woolie
[4:59:53] <the_Deadpan_Man> Zuko
[4:59:56] <RacistWakka> Saved humanity
[4:59:57] <%SouLucha> SURE SHE MIGHT HAVE MURDERED ALL HUMANS BUT EHH
[4:59:58] <CappuccinoGuil> New type of cop just dropped LUL
[4:59:59] <%Aceofstaves> Woolie what the fuck. This is authoritarian nightmare shit
[5:00:01] <chaos2frozen> You're literally down to 15 humans and you want to draw lines
[5:00:05] <jubejube56> Remember when this was about time travel and giant robots?
[5:00:07] <%Amaideus> How did she know that the nanos were gonna turn into a literal plague though?
[5:00:08] <alphalejandro> Babymura have a big bro now, that's Miura
[5:00:11] <%gatorafan> Woolie becomes the authority figure some high school kid will defeat one day
[5:00:12] <+skyheys> Okay, Judge Dredd
[5:00:12] <%Livelinne> shiaS
[5:00:13] <reonome> okay but you don't need to stick them in ANOTHER simulation
[5:00:15] <jorniev> is this the UNNIVERSAL TRUTH?
[5:00:17] <ShepherdShang> But Woolie, they need to keep the virtual prisons full
[5:00:21] <%Amaideus> And its entire purpose was to backup humanity FOREVER
[5:00:24] <%Lion_kun> Lolimura is kawaii
[5:00:25] <KeroKamina> so leave in Wajima?
[5:00:26] <RacistWakka> She saved humanity
[5:00:28] <pixel_river> making AI real poeple seems unethical somehow
[5:00:28] <%Aceofstaves> Woolie loves authority, add looking as it's him
[5:00:29] <NeonBleu> "Sorry but you tried to start a cult in or simulation"
[5:00:29] <sketchpixels> @WoolieVersus Kengo tricked Morimoraa into destoying the world. Kengo says this himself.
[5:00:31] <+BigCoffee> Woolie prooving he's still the most evil person on CSB
[5:00:32] <Lancaster_H> Woolie would die first in that shootout in 2188 because of this shit
[5:00:33] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[5:00:35] <%ekodrop> welcome to purgatory bitches
[5:00:36] <%jonblnt> frankly i'm with Woolie
[5:00:37] <Monkeyweed21> FALSE PURGATORY IS NOT A PAROLE
[5:00:37] <khetrak> @WoolieVersus and if they fail? make then slaves ?
[5:00:37] <+skyheys> IT IS
[5:00:38] <RacistWakka> Woolida
[5:00:38] <%Aceofstaves> what the fuck
[5:00:41] <bigshimmz> Bonjour, fellas
[5:00:45] <+jiggy_snipe> Remember guys, Woolie is a villain and cult leader
[5:00:47] <bigshimmz> Looking strong, Woolie
[5:00:48] <%Lion_kun> Doesn't Reggie have to go home?
[5:00:50] <+richardlikespies> GASLIGHTING IS NOT PAROLE
[5:00:51] <jorniev> WOOLIE with the righteous EVIL
[5:00:53] <%jonblnt> peace is fragile
[5:00:53] <+DakotaMacDoodle> The universal truth starts NOW!!!!
[5:00:57] <%SouLucha> Woolie isn't killing anyone, he is proving if they are worth bringing back to life.
[5:00:59] <RacistWakka> Ida thought he was reasonable too
[5:00:59] <+Dova573> Woolie confirmed the villain of the suequel
[5:01:00] <%gatorafan> Woolie you killed that one guy and we are all fine with you Kappa
[5:01:01] <%Amaideus> Reggie had to go home like an hour ago, lmao
[5:01:02] <+JacknZack27> It is unreasonable
[5:01:04] <+skyheys> ITS VERY UNREASONABLE
[5:01:06] <reonome> woolie has put us all in a simulation
[5:01:10] <%jonblnt> lawful evil
[5:01:11] <%Lion_kun> Only Woolie can take an hour of content and make it last for 5 hours haha
[5:01:12] <+0neReeler> democracy
[5:01:15] <%cvp5127> he didnt know it was the last loop
[5:01:16] <%Aceofstaves> Oh yeah, when had a small group of people ever unreasonably harmed one of their own right
[5:01:18] <+jiggy_snipe> how about you just be honest
[5:01:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> !uptime
[5:01:19] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 15 minutes
[5:01:24] <+richardlikespies> it's not that clone's fault
[5:01:25] <thesilverbard> This plan may be more evil than anything Pat has ever suggested on CSB
[5:01:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jiggy_snipe that's too hard
[5:01:28] <irfan_> trust is a meter
[5:01:32] <KnivesEve> woolie would choose the lawful route in a smt game
[5:01:33] <%Irridium> juro killed them kids
[5:01:34] <bigshimmz> That laptop is huge
[5:01:38] <%Aceofstaves> Woolie, clones are not the same people
[5:01:44] <Blank9> but everyone but ida redeemed themselves
[5:01:46] <+skyheys> "just clone them to see if you're evil"
[5:01:47] <%Amaideus> Those clones would be though
[5:01:49] <+jiggy_snipe> I love how Woolie's grand plan is to lie to them as if that won't piss them off
[5:01:52] <+JustBlubs> By doing this you may make them distrust you. So to be safe you should move them into a 3rd fake world to make sure they don't try and get revenge before pulling them out for real.
[5:01:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Babymura was tricked, Ida is rebuilding sectors and 426 literally set up the whole game system to give the 13 a shot, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?!
[5:01:54] <alphalejandro> and that includes RYOKO
[5:01:55] <%baka_sugoi> MY NANOMACHINES KILLED 13 KIDS
[5:01:56] <Monkeyweed21> THIS IS JUST THE STORY OF JOB @WoolieVersus
[5:01:56] <%Amaideus> Because of the AI nano attachment thing
[5:02:01] <rosemon5001> stabbing the babys or punting them yea you both go to SAO
[5:02:01] <+skyheys> SOUNDS LIKE WOOLIE
[5:02:03] <RacistWakka> Yeah Ida
[5:02:04] <Lancaster_H> yeah gaslight them, that'll go well once they realize that
[5:02:06] <xbb1024> don't forget the other Inaba
[5:02:07] <+Dachillin> sounds like a villian
[5:02:13] <%great_tj> YEAH OK, MR IDA
[5:02:15] <+richardlikespies> COOL WOOLIE..BIG MORALS
[5:02:23] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Woolies grand design!
[5:02:23] <%Amaideus> To be fair, Lolibaba and Ida would probably understand
[5:02:26] <r_xanadu> So, his solution is making the same busted justice system we had in the old world? Can't wait for Wajima to get out on good behavior... only to be the worst when he gets out
[5:02:29] <+0neReeler> you need those kind of people
[5:02:30] <+richardlikespies> GASLIGHT THEM WITH PURGATORY
[5:02:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BUT GOD CAN READ HEARTS HE DOESN'T NEED TO TEST EM
[5:02:38] <%baka_sugoi> GGs
[5:02:39] <%RyTYoung> END
[5:02:39] <%Amaideus> Lolibaba took Renya beating her pretty well

[5:04:09] <jorniev> ITS JUST A LOADING SCREN
[5:04:13] <+MirTeiwaz_TV> The clock is only there while that character believes it's time travel, from what I could tell
[5:04:16] <aiwass8> i solved time travel because of clock, Woolie
[5:04:18] <+skyheys> IT WAS THEIR PERCEPTION
[5:04:18] <pixel_river> its just a fancy transition Kappa

[5:04:47] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> God dammit Reggie
[5:04:49] <%gatorafan> Put that clock on probation, and if it proves to be trustworthy we keep using it.
[5:04:49] <jorniev> TAKES TIME TO RENDER
[5:04:51] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Time isn't real so how are clocks real?
[5:04:53] <%osaka_daioh> Watch there be an interview that shows why it's not a lie.
[5:04:53] <+skyheys> It only shows up when someone THINKS they're time travelling
[5:04:55] <%Amaideus> You should be!
[5:04:57] <Monkeyweed21> the clock is just a little loading animation
[5:04:57] <jubejube56> They put so much budget in the clock animation tho

[5:09:33] <irfan_> you can still save manually
[5:09:36] <%Amaideus> NICE
[5:09:39] <%Amaideus> IT'S ALL GOING IN
[5:09:39] <hamahiroyuki> Rimworld is described by creator as sci-fi story maker. We, fans, nicknamed "War crimes simulator"
[5:09:44] <OblivionSword1> eh it's fine

[5:10:17] <%Lion_kun> Disco Elysium is gonna be so fun to dissect
[5:10:21] <Althallos> Thanks to your playthrough I both got a more clear picture of the overall story after my own playthrough, but also a new personality to enjoy videos of. Loving the Guilty Gear lore vids.
[5:10:23] <%Amaideus> Natsuno might be dumb
[5:10:24] <reonome> CUTE
[5:10:25] <+BigCoffee> not okino and hiji?
[5:10:26] <RacistWakka> Thanks!!!
[5:10:28] <%Amaideus> But she's a sweetie
[5:10:32] <Pnutz409> what was the assist on the loops? i missed
[5:10:34] <quietshun> Ei gets to look forward to the Morimura body tho
[5:10:36] <reonome> THATS HOT THOUGH
[5:10:37] <+jiggy_snipe> Okino keeps messing with Hiji
[5:10:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:10:40] <%Amaideus> Okino's a bit too sadistic for most people
[5:10:45] <Blank9> okino didn't get the consensual part of consensual nonconsent
[5:10:49] <%Livelinne> LUL LUL
[5:10:49] <+0neReeler> okino hijiyama
[5:10:53] <Lancaster_H> that's the appeal
[5:10:54] <morningmoondude> it's like the chokejerk
[5:10:59] <+JacknZack27> He liked it tho
[5:10:59] <%Irridium> he likes to play with his food
[5:11:00] <hamahiroyuki> also does wools know about the cum dungeon of bloodborne?
[5:11:00] <%jonblnt> i'm ok with some brain tourture
[5:11:01] <%Amaideus> Also Okino wants out of the sim
[5:11:03] <+justianxix> yeah but hes into it tho
[5:11:04] <%Amaideus> REAL BAD
[5:11:04] <khetrak> what is a little brain manipulation between good friends
[5:11:07] <%Livelinne> They’re Don/Sub
[5:11:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Okino and Hiji's relationship kept getting weirdly sexual
[5:11:14] <roboyuji> Okino is sadodere
[5:11:16] <reonome> he's definitely a sub LUL
[5:11:20] <+0neReeler> okino is the pants
[5:11:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> Come on we all did a little mind breaking in school right guys...?
[5:11:29] <%Amaideus> Okino going "I can be whatever I want in here" while implicitly saying "come check my taint bro" is PEAK
[5:11:30] <morningmoondude> Hiji is a hungry bi disaster that's into it
[5:11:31] <BanquoViaquo> I think that's when Okino put in the Sentinel activation for HIS model, actually
[5:11:31] <Lancaster_H> woolie is too vanilla
[5:11:35] <%Amaideus> I mean, i know I did
[5:11:36] <%illtima> Can you believe that in the Japanese popularity contest Tomi didn't even get into top 10 and top 1 was Ryoko
[5:11:38] <OblivionSword1> only Vanilla in this house
[5:11:38] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie you just advocated for brain torture 20 minutes ago @WoolieVersus
[5:11:42] <RacistWakka> Wholesome ship
[5:11:44] <%cvp5127> dogface how wholesome LUL
[5:11:45] <%Amaideus> Yeah I can
[5:11:53] <jorniev> HE IS MORALLY GREY
[5:11:54] <sketchpixels> Woolie you not into (SBT) Submissive Brain Torture?
[5:11:57] <+Zasne> Nah, Natsuno x Miura number 1!!
[5:11:58] <zhenthrim213> Ryoko best girl
[5:12:00] <%Amaideus> Because Japanese people have shit taste :^)
[5:12:02] <pixel_river> kurabe
[5:12:04] <Althallos> @illtima Probably because Ryoko's VA is Hayami Saori
[5:12:11] <%Amaideus> Go read the character polls on harem series
[5:12:14] <RacistWakka> Nah
[5:12:15] <CappuccinoGuil> 3rd place is Miwako and ALL THE BOYS
[5:12:20] <Blank9> that's 3rd place by default
[5:12:20] <khetrak> Ryoko got first place because of the double turret thing
[5:12:22] <%Amaideus> IT's always a Tsundere and a robot in the top 3
[5:12:28] <Lancaster_H> Juro and Megumi 2025
[5:12:30] <RacistWakka> YES
[5:12:31] <KeroKamina> what abotu Izumi and Morimura?
[5:12:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Gouto and the TRUTH
[5:12:35] <gamria> Whatever happens onwards, I'm sure Gouto will look after Ryoko
[5:12:42] <Monkeyweed21> Gouto X notebook
[5:12:44] <Pnutz409> Gouto and his notebook
[5:12:50] <%Amaideus> But you're gonna bounce off Pat
