[0:10:34] <%cubbywolf> for some reason I thought the Gundam live action movie would be good. All it took was a single frame of artwork to remind me it's hollywood so it wont be

[0:11:11] <%BisoromiBear> @BisoromiBear it's just an awkward way to start the series in my opinion, especially when you get the same stuff once it becomes relevant
[0:11:12] <badguy8312> @andre11dr pour one out for the fallen homie. unless you work for amazon, don't pour that out;
[0:11:17] <%Lion_kun> But I guess they didn't want to be sued.

[2:21:54] <pedro_jose461> 240 AT, reduces HP by level x2 in battle
[2:22:35] <pedro_jose461> so its pretty much a glass cannon weapon at the end
[2:22:36] <topendbuzza> thats what happens when you put points in it
[2:22:45] <Duskendawn> Everyone wants that bastard
[2:22:47] <andre11dr> And thats why Minh should just keep pumping HP
[2:23:10] <topendbuzza> one god han no need for one gems
[2:23:14] <topendbuzza> has*
[2:23:20] <+Grayhammatter> reggie needs more speed to catch up with woolie, then just snipe him with meteor+
[2:23:20] <andre11dr> Because eventually Woolie will do over 2K
[2:23:55] <pedro_jose461> Minh will have so much AT when he gets to the chest
[2:24:23] <pedro_jose461> does he have a lockpick tho?

[4:27:59] <dds333a> @rurounigeo imagine if it is LUL
[4:28:01] <%MajorCrasher> man I feel like if Woolie was to turn darkling, Minh might still beat him in a fight
[4:28:05] <%seydaq> enbMona enbMusic enbMusic
[4:28:06] <+Shady_Zaku> Man this game can fuck off, I'm glad I don't have to suffer through this doodYelp doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub
[4:28:07] <Duskendawn> Ao-tan sounds like a vtuber
[4:28:16] <%ekodrop> lol it's a cursed weapon
[4:28:47] <%ekodrop> Scythe At: 240 Reduces HP by two levels, in combat.
[4:28:49] <+VersaceDishes> its not that the dunk contest is bad or lacks innovation, it's that the big names dont participate anymore. lebron james has never done one
[4:28:51] <dds333a> in the glossary
[4:29:00] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:29:03] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[4:29:17] <fuji_n2> LUL
[4:29:17] <FlowLethal> Use it to end game
[4:29:25] <andre11dr> It makes you lose levels, DAMN
[4:29:25] <Hammatime8> Jesus fucking christ, the game is OVER
[4:29:31] <FlowLethal> He can beat game though
[4:29:34] <andre11dr> That was mad worth
[4:29:34] <+eanscrale> Become King Allant
[4:29:34] <dds333a> is it the player or opponent?
[4:29:36] <+SuperKirby24> LUL
[4:29:37] <FlowLethal> At this point
[4:29:37] <%ekodrop> no the user losses hp
[4:29:41] <+VersaceDishes> the last huge star to win a dunk contest was donovan mitchell
[4:29:43] <Duskendawn> Wait effects user or target here?
[4:29:46] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like the user loses hp
[4:29:48] <oda_flobunaga> No, Woolie likes to Overthink
[4:29:49] <%doomunderthestairs> its Priscillas scythe kinda
[4:29:50] <Maleicus> looks more like user
[4:29:50] <haitakaa> probably the user
[4:29:51] <%ekodrop> reggie is right
[4:29:54] <+pectusumbra> That's what I would assume as well
[4:29:54] <Landedx> in combat tho
[4:29:55] <dds333a> @versacedishes that makes sense too
[4:29:59] <topendbuzza> reggie is right
[4:30:03] <yodajr99> I had a cursed flail that gave me permanent curse status
[4:30:03] <immaterializer> didn't kingdom have something similar near endgame
[4:30:08] <oda_flobunaga> No, just No Woolie
[4:30:09] <%notsoy> minh the dokage
[4:30:23] <yodajr99> but also gave me 400 at
[4:30:24] <fuji_n2> Minh wins again I guess
[4:30:26] <+RurouniGeo> Time for Black Alliance
[4:30:29] <FlowLethal> Minh loses some hp but he tank
[4:30:32] <%xcompleasedad> Go Darkling and DESTROY
[4:30:32] <dds333a> hold on, who is it for seriously LUL
[4:30:33] <%ekodrop> well they'll find our right now
[4:30:33] <Duskendawn> Scythe sprite looks good though
[4:30:34] <+terry_quest> its his hp
[4:30:38] <%baronblank> minh lost hp, the scythe hurts him
[4:30:41] <+meteor530> Minh is slowly turning into Madara
[4:30:43] <+Jiggisnipe> see
[4:30:43] <+Grayhammatter> it's his hp
[4:30:49] <dds333a> the wielder
[4:30:52] <Hammatime8> Ohhhhh
[4:30:53] <+Jiggisnipe> that would be fucked if Woolie was right
[4:30:59] <Hammatime8> That's a bit more balanced
[4:30:59] <+pectusumbra> It drains your life in exchange for super power
[4:31:00] <dds333a> it atrophied his hp
[4:31:00] <Duskendawn> Ohhh
[4:31:01] <+Shady_Zaku> "when it says reduces hp by 2 levels, every time you enter a battle, you lose hp equal to x2 of your level, so if you're lvl 30, you lose 60 hp at the beginning of every battle you're in.  I currently am using a scythe with a fighter, its not bad when you get the initiative, but it can hurt if you defend first. I found mine in a red chest, got lucky I guess."
[4:31:03] <+Jiggisnipe> it's still a good weapon for Minh tho
[4:31:04] <+Grayhammatter> that would have been fucked
[4:31:07] <FlowLethal> That’s nothing
[4:31:09] <fuji_n2> WOOLIE IS WRONG AGAIN LUL
[4:31:10] <R_Blaze> Woolie the unintentional Liar
[4:31:14] <%seydaq> lifehunt minh
[4:31:14] <%notsoy> it sucked 144 HP and he's level 72
[4:31:15] <Duskendawn> It's perfect for minh
[4:31:16] <+pectusumbra> but it's still the perfect weapon for Minh
[4:31:17] <dds333a> it's not a loss tho LUL
[4:31:19] <maznuts> woolie the lier
[4:31:19] <+terry_quest> hes a fucking drk knight
[4:31:25] <andre11dr> This actually compliments him build perfectly
[4:31:32] <%ekodrop> yeah 2 hp per level
[4:31:32] <topendbuzza> minh is busted
[4:31:34] <andre11dr> Now he's double broken
[4:31:36] <%specters_art88> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[4:31:41] <+polothegreatest> in combat
[4:31:50] <fuji_n2> ACTUAL DARK KNIGHT BUILD LUL
[4:31:50] <%notsoy> still not as busted as the gun that could randomly get bonus lightning damage
[4:31:52] <Duskendawn> Is it 2% hp?
[4:31:54] <+pectusumbra> it's not written very well, but THATS DOKAPON BABY
[4:31:54] <%baronblank> it was unclear admittedly
[4:31:55] <R_Blaze> Behold the Chikage
[4:31:57] <+Grayhammatter> it's only in combat though
[4:31:58] <Hammatime8> Bad wording
[4:32:02] <yodajr99> paladin is great
[4:32:05] <+pingu_crimson> @pectusumbra it's double your level
[4:32:06] <%notsoy> no, it's HP equal to twice the holder's level
[4:32:14] <Duskendawn> Terrible localization LUL
[4:32:21] <glass_marcus> oh that means banish wont work anymore
[4:32:22] <%seydaq> old school yugioh problem
[4:32:24] <Hammatime8> That champion is beefy
[4:32:24] <+pingu_crimson> @pectusumbra oh lol wrong comment
[4:32:25] <+Jiggisnipe> oh
[4:32:28] <+pectusumbra> @pectusumbra right I see that. but the in-game text is still not written well
[4:32:35] <+pectusumbra> and got ya
[4:32:40] <dds333a> @rurounigeo I guess it kinda is a lifesteal scythe huh LUL
[4:32:43] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:32:46] <%ekodrop> ot
[4:32:47] <fuji_n2> 2x your lvl
[4:32:47] <+Jiggisnipe> that's written so BAD
[4:32:49] <+Grayhammatter> that says nothing
[4:32:53] <Treasure_Vault> By 2x your level? That's confusing
[4:32:56] <+Jiggisnipe> it's 2x your levels
[4:32:57] <+pectusumbra> @WoolieVersus it's level x 2 HP lost per combat
[4:32:57] <+Grayhammatter> twice his levels
[4:32:58] <oda_flobunaga> 72x2
[4:32:58] <+Shady_Zaku> @woolieversus when it says reduces hp by 2 levels, every time you enter a battle, you lose hp equal to x2 of your level, so if you're lvl 30, you lose 60 hp at the beginning of every battle you're in.
[4:32:58] <%ekodrop> @WoolieVersus it's 2hp per level
[4:32:59] <%fetrigon> that's a shit description wtf
[4:33:00] <Hammatime8> TERRIBLE wording there
[4:33:00] <Treasure_Vault> That's just bad translation
[4:33:04] <oda_flobunaga> 144
[4:33:13] <+Damie904> It's Level times 2. He's level 72 so he lost 72*2 which is 144.
[4:33:14] <Onamar> Bad translation
[4:33:14] <fuji_n2> that's written so horribly
[4:33:15] <+Grayhammatter> he lost 144
[4:33:17] <topendbuzza> 144
[4:33:21] <topendbuzza> he lost
[4:33:25] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah just bad wordking its double your current level
[4:33:30] <dds333a> I had the right idea, but it DOES NOT tell you who it affects, or the specifics
[4:33:33] <fuji_n2> he lost 144, 2x the level
[4:33:33] <+Shady_Zaku> Fuck sake guys just look at chat doodScrub

[4:42:38] <R_Blaze> question for chat, do you prefer chikage/damage self over time or bloodletter/Big damage self only once
[4:42:58] <dds333a> @r_blaze the latter for me
[4:43:01] <glass_marcus> Self only once. Less to keep track of
[4:43:05] <+meteor530> Latter
[4:43:15] <Duskendawn> Chikage killed me more bc I don't pay attention LUL
[4:43:18] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:43:20] <fuji_n2> chikage imo
[4:43:22] <+pingu_crimson> actually is there a document of the complete weapon list?
[4:43:29] <andre11dr> @r_blaze Blooletter is cooler but chikage does is just so OP it's really unfair
[4:43:36] <dds333a> @duskendawn I feel that LUL
[4:44:06] <+Grayhammatter> cleaning up this chapter nice and quick
[4:44:17] <dds333a> reg going for it
[4:44:18] <R_Blaze> @Duskendawn  I prefer the bloodletter for similar reasons LUL

[4:46:42] <fuji_n2> Minh might just tank the meteor honestly
[4:46:50] <+Grayhammatter> @mighty_max_t he's been stuck on the final continent for a while now

[5:44:55] <FlowLethal> free slot
[5:45:04] <%mighty_max_t> @wawila Kingdom, for sure. Since this is on the DS, you'd have to pass the controller around and it can create incidents, like Minh's accidental mashing
[5:45:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
