[0:10:01] <Ashenik1> translation is its own craftsmanship
[0:10:03] <@Menitta> The problem is that English and Japanese are incredibly different
[0:10:06] <%BisoromiBear> Somewhere between old Kamen Rider subs and Commie subs is the sweet spot
[0:10:10] <@Menitta> Shocking I know

[0:10:40] <+Grayhammatter> it's fine

[0:12:01] <+Deekman> oh so they ruined the joke?
[0:12:01] <CappuccinoGuil> Transliteration is important for cultural adaptation. Lucio and Raze have much better lines in the Portuguese dub. Also more accurate accents

[0:15:09] <+jiggy_snipe> all in to watch Reggie fail Kappa ... LUL
[0:15:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Dubbing in Brazil was so weird because back when TVs got widespread, there was a government push to dub everything because subs were impossible to read. So we got REALLY GOOD at dubbing everything LUL

[0:17:17] <WinstonFromUndertale> Everyone move to Jersey
[0:17:23] <%ChoculaUltra> sounds like Austin during SWSX
[0:17:29] <$jake5713> The missus and I are thinking of ditch the US for either Canada or Scotland/Ireland. We're not worthy of NZ.
[0:17:32] <ShortAssRibs> " infinite festivals" is a great company name
[0:17:47] <shadowcrisis> Lets all move to Gary Indiana
[0:17:48] <OblivionSword1> UNLIMITED FESTIVAL WORKS
[0:17:53] <%seniormeatbox> this sounds like a futurama joke
[0:17:53] <Ashenik1> In POland we have this weird tradition wher we dont use subtitle but dubs is just one guy, lector coldly translating things that had been said ;d
[0:17:56] <@akuda_bar> @shadowcrisis so good they wrote a song about it
[0:18:10] <%Chatterbox1991> In conclusion; Fuck Toronto :)
[0:18:18] <ikantreeed> @WoolieVersus rent is affordable compared to where i'm from too
[0:18:28] <+Excessumamyamy> Thank you for the recommendation^^ I haven't read/watched YYH yet but I absolutely plan to; I will try and look up some of the dub memes in the mean time @CappuccinoGuil
[0:18:31] <shadowcrisis> so good you get free housing....might get murdered but free housing
[0:18:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Man, I really liked Toronto when I lived there for 2 years, it's a great place. Montreal is fantastic, though
[0:18:36] <%ChoculaUltra> sounds p chill
[0:18:43] <+cherryceecee> atleast theres stuff to do in toronto try growing up in sauga or brampton :(
[0:18:46] <%MisterArcanine> MisterArcanine subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Woolie I bought 13 Sentinels from watching your LP . Incredible game and thanks for making me pull the trigger on buying it
[0:18:46] <%RyTYoung> Edinburgh be like that
[0:19:12] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Chat, go watch Attack on Titan
[0:19:21] <shadowcrisis> no^^
[0:19:24] <crimsonharvest> ah
[0:19:27] <shadowcrisis> i already did
[0:19:29] <%ChoculaUltra> sad to admit the only things I know about Toronto or Canada are cursory tidbits picked up from Drake and Weeknd songs LUL
[0:19:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Magic fun is hard in the beginning because it is EXPENSIVE.
[0:19:40] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @shadowcrisis psaUp
[0:19:44] <majindusto> Since when was there Split Screen?
[0:19:44] <Ashenik1> In New York renting the closet costs like renting the whole apartment in a small town

[0:20:43] <%Lion_kun> Except Shinonome
[0:20:44] <shadowcrisis> Reggie needs to puff out that fro
[0:20:45] <%ChoculaUltra> Future Tomi is dumb bad
[0:20:46] <%A_German_spy> @Ashenik1 charly23Hi
[0:20:49] <%Amaideus> "Future" tomi
[0:20:51] <+brickwall35> but who's the worst
[0:20:52] <+Excessumamyamy> what about best husbando :)
[0:20:53] <shadowcrisis> no need to hide your hair
[0:20:55] <majindusto> PICK A CHOICE, WOOLIE
[0:20:59] <CappuccinoGuil> We all agree Ogata won tho, right? RIGHT?!
[0:21:00] <+Grayhammatter> there's a little something for everyone
[0:21:01] <%illtima> In their recent top 10 rating, Rioko was somehow #1, while Tomi didn't even make the cut
[0:21:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Ogata won free
[0:21:08] <Ashenik1> I bought DMC V cuase of these fuckers
[0:21:08] <%ChoculaUltra> Ogata won 13 Sentinels, hands down
[0:21:11] <%xeromage> Vanillaware is always a buy
[0:21:14] <Prevot> I haven't yet, but I'm planning on getting it too
[0:21:25] <%seniormeatbox> I don't have money to dono right now but these streams made me pick up the OG demon souls for my PS3
[0:21:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Ogata has been in the winner's bracket all game
[0:21:31] <ronin19xx> Yakuza 0 is 4.99 on US PSN store FYI
[0:21:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Vanillaware made a game to tell us Ogata won, respect
[0:21:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I wish Vanillaware knew PC existed
[0:21:45] <MyNameIsRasus> ogata isn't bipolar he's biwinning
[0:21:45] <%Amaideus> Man this 13 sentinels talk just made me forget for a second that this is gonna be a DeS stream
[0:21:55] <%ChoculaUltra> @Amaideus LUL same
[0:21:55] <MyNameIsRasus> he's a total freaking rockstar from -redacted-
[0:22:00] <DaBigVitus> when did the new zoomed in set up happen
[0:22:07] <%A_German_spy> A_German_spy gifted a Tier 1 sub to seniormeatbox!
[0:22:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @DaBigVitus last week
[0:22:15] <%Amaideus> I just opened up my notepad doc and everything, lmfao
[0:22:15] <lucky_icarus> I'd get it if it was also on Switch
[0:22:18] <%seniormeatbox> @A_German_spy Thanks for the gift sub! I really appreciate it!
[0:22:19] <%A_German_spy> @seniormeatbox I got you
[0:22:22] <%ChoculaUltra> I would definitely buy 13 Sentinels again if it got a Steam port
[0:22:28] <majindusto> WHY SPLIT SCREEN?
[0:22:30] <%Amaideus> It definitely needs a PC port
[0:22:33] <+Excessumamyamy> Hopefully it gets a port
[0:22:37] <CappuccinoGuil> We need 13 sentinels on PC, I need it
[0:22:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Not afraid of overhyping 13 sentinels, like Undertale was?
[0:22:51] <DaBigVitus> @CappuccinoGuil it's so....close. intimate
[0:23:00] <thatgreenhatguy> Haven’t heard a peep about it outside this community. Shame.
[0:23:07] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm watching someone else playing it for start and BOY it's a fun ride.
[0:23:12] <%Lion_kun> I like the game, I wish it didn't have RTS.
[0:23:16] <%ChoculaUltra> the 13 sentinels subreddit is v wholesome but very barren
[0:23:20] <@akuda_bar> @majindusto becaus it's fancy
[0:23:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:23:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Supergiant Games DON'T MISS
[0:23:37] <majindusto> Yep,
[0:23:38] <%SaiyanShoto> I think when Simmons talked to Max about the game he managed to do a good job about talking about the game, and showing it but didn’t really spoil anything. He got people in that chat to buy the game lol
[0:23:40] <Prevot> hades been like that for months already
[0:23:43] <amritadyne> i feel that
[0:23:43] <velgaduere> what a bad position to take
[0:23:44] <Johannen> Hades has style over substance
[0:23:45] <%nintega010> People wanna hate to hate.
[0:23:47] <%Chatterbox1991> Thanks Matt...
[0:23:48] <Equirah> Hades' not even that good
[0:23:50] <dundore77> Or Jojo. or Fate
[0:23:50] <brunoberserk> oh boy , the overhype of undertale ruined that game for me
[0:23:52] <OblivionSword1> Max was almost that
[0:23:55] <+brickwall35> @johannen wrong
[0:23:59] <Solidnick18> i need to get hades
[0:24:00] <%seniormeatbox> @A_German_spy Seriously though, thank you! Remind me to return the favor next month!
[0:24:03] <%mergley> Hades is great but I can't stand Rogue-likes
[0:24:03] <+brickwall35> psaWrong
[0:24:04] <+cherryceecee> fate is perfect
[0:24:05] <%Amaideus> SEND THE CHAT TO BABY JAIL
[0:24:09] <majindusto> T-Thanks Matt
[0:24:10] <%Amaideus> WE NEED THE GAOL WOOLIE
[0:24:10] <%gatorafan> it's all Matt using alt accounts Kappa
[0:24:12] <%A_German_spy> @seniormeatbox No worries, and no need. Pay it forward!
[0:24:14] <%nintega010> @OblivionSword1 Max just didn't want to listen to matt
[0:24:16] <+ManimalCrackerss> now kiss MWAH
[0:24:20] <+ColonelHandzLanza> It's like that with anything popular, Red Dead, Witcher 3 both had that pushback
[0:24:22] <+Undenizen> random thought: both these games have LGBT+ representation prominently
[0:24:22] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Its like Undertale. People eating it up
[0:24:24] <%ChoculaUltra> the undertale online community ruined the game for me. Can't sit through an lp without someone shouting to the streamer they're doing something wrong or whatever
[0:24:26] <OldManDeckardCain> hades is really good, but people claiming it's the second coming of christ need to chill LUL
[0:24:39] <lem______> come back to me when hades has an AU multiverse
[0:24:45] <Johannen> @OldManDeckardCain Thank you
[0:24:46] <%Amaideus> The problem with Undertale's hype is that there very quickly became a "right way" to play it
[0:24:47] <%Order_of_Mystery> so what we need to do is get Max to play 13 sentinels, gotcha /s
[0:24:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Hades is fun af but I think it’s a little overhyped. Like I’m not a fan of some of the voice acting or music
[0:24:50] <BlackermanZX> whens 13 sentintels for pc tho
[0:24:56] <%MisterArcanine> I personally think Hades is the second coming of Christ
[0:25:05] <%Lion_kun> 13 sentinels is one of the rare games that should be played in English
[0:25:08] <+Undenizen> @lem______ I'm a big undertale fanboy but dear god the AU stuff...
[0:25:09] <%nintega010> @Order_of_Mystery simmons is playing it so its fine
[0:25:16] <%Amaideus> And then years later that fandom had morphed into a muckmonster that no one wants to go near
[0:25:21] <%Order_of_Mystery> heck yeah
[0:25:23] <%Lion_kun> Remember LOU2 has a better story than 13 sentinels.
[0:25:26] <Johannen> I liked Bastion more than Hades
[0:25:26] <+cherryceecee> @Amaideus exactly, trying to do any run other than pacifist at launch got you yelled at
[0:25:29] <%bread_assassin> bread_assassin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Fun Fact of the Month: If you melted down the Eiffel Tower, the pool of iron would be less than 3 inches deep (in a square area the same dimensions as the tower base).
[0:25:29] <majindusto> Took a Hit? What?
[0:25:33] <ayexp4254> no it doesnt haha
[0:25:35] <OldManDeckardCain> at least hades deserves the hype more than botw did
[0:25:37] <DesDavis> undertale syndrome
[0:25:41] <%cvp5127> 300k sold worldwide NotLikeThis
[0:25:43] <@Menitta> I will say, I'm going into 13 Sentinels like "Impress me"
[0:25:48] <%SaiyanShoto> @oldmandeckardcain hard agree with that
[0:25:53] <GarbageNirvana> it sounds like a super interesting game
[0:25:56] <+Undenizen> @OldManDeckardCain mmmmm dunnoboutthatone
[0:26:07] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[0:26:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Dude, Undertale scenario is better every single time
[0:26:21] <+Amaideus> BoTW has massive flaws, but I legit can't go back to any of the 3d zeldas now
[0:26:29] <GeoffGeofreed> nicobPog
[0:26:33] <%Amaideus> I keep getting frustrated that I can't climb over everything, lmao
[0:26:39] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta you're impressed by like... the last samurai
[0:26:40] <%ChoculaUltra> Is Vanillaware a public traded company? I'd invest.
[0:26:47] <%Gamefriendly> woah, i haven't been able to catch a livestream in awhile, but the new camera angles are cool
[0:26:47] <OldManDeckardCain> @Amaideus maybe most 3d zeldas are just kinda meh now Kappa
[0:26:48] <@akuda_bar> you're impressed by tiny pancakes
[0:26:51] <%JustYudha> I don't do math so I trust you then

[0:27:12] <%Amaideus> Idk, MM is still my number 1 game
[0:27:16] <%ChoculaUltra> what's heavier - a pound of feathers or a pound of melted iron Kappa
[0:27:18] <+kevlarkoala> i'm an anime watcher who just saw this manga episode go up, how far ahead are they?
[0:27:23] <+Deekman> Apparently Pat JUST right now beat 13 Sentinels
[0:27:23] <%xeromage> but it's Europe, so NOT INCHES
[0:27:25] <+brickwall35> I would have guessed less honestly, it has a wide bass area
[0:27:27] <KaiserMario> Wait, I just got here, did they mirror the screen?
[0:27:28] <@Menitta> I deadass almost watched Last Samurai last night lmao
[0:27:28] <+LordCasante> @theredfox930000 I can't in see that now
[0:27:29] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta hey is for horses gackson
[0:27:31] <%A_German_spy> @kevlarkoala 3-1
[0:27:33] <therealtacopancakes> its base is 125x125 m
[0:27:34] <%Jetzord> As long as the forces sum up to zero with a safety factor, it's good
[0:27:34] <%fakeburg> The metal on the tower doesn't look at that thick, so it might be true
[0:27:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> but...japan is in eurpoe

[0:30:35] <%robo_trunk> The tourists ruining tourism
[0:30:39] <%holydeviant1> I would totally grab a garbage bag and help clean that up, even as an american tourist it's sad to see
[0:30:42] <+Undenizen> Being at the top of the Eiffel tower on a windy day is kinda terrifying
[0:30:43] <therealtacopancakes> all the europeans hate those people
[0:30:49] <%Amaideus> That's why you've gotta go at the times no one is around
[0:30:50] <Darren716> If Woolie went to Italy he'd just recreate Part 5 scenes
[0:30:50] <smollish_d> That’s how I felt when I was in France

[0:31:56] <%ChoculaUltra> its okay to be a tourist just don't act like a tourist, if that makes any sense
[0:31:57] <kulmoth> but that shit internet though

[0:49:42] <Equirah> remember that time he killed one, didn't pick the drop and then died? LUL
[0:49:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @JobbedBone not in the remake
[0:49:49] <%A_German_spy> @JobbedBone Not in the remake, no
[0:49:51] <bone_reaper69> the remake made it so if they walk off cliffs, they dont disappear forever
[0:49:51] <GeoffGeofreed> I don't pity Thomas but I don't hate him, he probably will kill himself someday from the Guilty like that old guy in AoT
[0:49:55] <GlaceonYo> Whats with the weird split cam? First time I've seen this.
[0:49:57] <%JobbedBone> oh thats so generous
[0:50:01] <DaBigVitus> @Equirah did they even notice?
[0:50:08] <+kevlarkoala> this playthrough made me finally start Dark Souls 3 (since i'm a filthy pc player and can't play DeS remake)

[0:50:33] <GeoffGeofreed> @glaceonyo Quarantine I think
[0:50:33] <%A_German_spy> @StarlitStunner charly23Hi
[0:50:39] <Equirah> @DaBigVitus think wollie did but didn't make a big deal of it, just casually mentioned it
[0:50:48] <GlaceonYo> @GeoffGeofreed They are totally in the same room
[0:51:22] <GeoffGeofreed> oh then I'm not sure, probably so they have a clear close up
[0:51:38] <GlaceonYo> I'm just used to the full couch view they normally use
[0:51:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:58] <%ChoculaUltra> he said begone
[0:52:01] <+Grayhammatter> BEGONE
[0:52:04] <+TheotherKristian> What's up with the dual camera setup?
[0:52:05] <Equirah> why not keep it as was while testing it
[0:52:14] <DaBigVitus> chat, what should i pay for a ps3 copy of the first nier? bidding
[0:52:17] <GlaceonYo> Same thing I asked
[0:52:31] <GlaceonYo> Answer was ???
[0:52:38] <Equirah> @DaBigVitus you're gonna get gouged
[0:52:38] <+BettyMwwaahh> ths setup makes it look like Woolie is sitting in Reggies lap
[0:52:45] <GlaceonYo> lol
[0:52:57] <BurdRightsActivist> @DaBigVitus Don't spend more than 60$ I bought mine two years ago for 55 CAD
[0:53:02] <%A_German_spy> @Equirah @GlaceonYo To get rid of the shard of Meltstone, so they don't accidentally use it on a fully-upgraded weapon later
[0:53:06] <%Amaideus> Is the video quality kinda crap for anyone else?
[0:53:18] <+TheotherKristian> @DaBigVitus I say, no more than $55 CAD, $40 ish USD before one starts questioning if its worth it, the remake is coming out this year
[0:53:18] <%Amaideus> It's fine on youtube, so I don't think it's on my end
[0:53:22] <dmtjinni> LUL
[0:53:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Can you enchant Mercury Rapier?
[0:53:24] <DaBigVitus> @BurdRightsActivist dang ok. good to know
[0:53:30] <CappuccinoGuil> You're in the nexus, try it
[0:53:39] <Equirah> @A_German_spy fair enough
[0:53:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Huh? Why can't you enchant it?
[0:53:57] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Wooden weapon
[0:53:59] <+Grayhammatter> huh...
[0:54:01] <brunoberserk> UNGA BUNGA
[0:54:07] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy that... makes no sense?
[0:54:15] <Ilkim61> can't you cast on Crushing weapons anyway, or is it different from DS3 rules?
[0:54:22] <+Grayhammatter> UNGA BUNGA
[0:54:24] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil It makes more sense in the context of not being able to use fire buffs like Pine Resin on it
[0:54:31] <+Grayhammatter> reggie has become warrior main
[0:54:34] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil But yeah, some of this game's weapons follow bizarre rules
[0:54:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> How does Reggie like the Tower?
[0:54:39] <X2Eliah> So I never really noticed until this side-to-side camera setup, but Reggie's head is about 20% smaller than Woolie's
[0:54:45] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Great Club can't be upgraded. At all.
[0:54:51] <BurdRightsActivist> @DaBigVitus actually it was more around 40-ish. Still pretty cheap. Current prices are fine rn but they're defs gonna shoot up once people realize the Dad is exclusive to the old version. They're cheaper rn because of the remake announcement
[0:54:53] <%Lion_kun> HNRGHHHHHH
[0:55:16] <+Grayhammatter> EYAUAAUURGH! help me!
[0:55:19] <bone_reaper69> there are signs actually lol
[0:55:20] <OblivionSword1> PLEASE HELP ME
[0:55:26] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil I guess Fromsoft thought they were balancing those weapons in that manner, but all it did was make them less useful
[0:55:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy that makes sense, yeah. But not being able to enchant it silly. It might be a situation where Enchant Weapon and Resins give the same category of buff, so the code isn't allowing it to be buffed
[0:55:34] <shadowcrisis> Much strong. Such weak opponents. 15/10 Dogge approves
[0:55:34] <BurdRightsActivist> EYYAAAUUUURRRGHHHHH PLEASE HELP ME

[0:55:48] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil That's exactly it, yeah. Same buff category for Pine Resin and Enchant Weapon.
[0:55:48] <+jiggy_snipe> my god wow wtf
[0:55:52] <Hundred_Hand_Slap> you guys play Jedi: Fallen Order? The PS5 patch makes the game smooth and sexy

[0:56:16] <%Amaideus> Look at Reggie get this murder boner over backstabbing
[0:56:17] <Ilkim61> could try the katana and rapier backstabs while at it
[0:56:18] <%ekodrop> are the animations for one and two handed backstabs different?
[0:56:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy for sure, feels like an unintended consequence of the design, not a conscious decision
[0:56:20] <Solidnick18> yeeeeee
[0:56:22] <dundore77> thats what's going on here
[0:56:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Do axes recover faster if you hit an enemy in Demon's souls?
[0:56:28] <DaBigVitus> @BurdRightsActivist so it did go for about 40 usd in the end. honestly, more than i was willing to take a chance on so let it slide

[0:57:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Awesome, thanks man
[0:57:50] <%A_German_spy> @CanadianAnimatorGuy No worries.
[0:57:50] <X2Eliah> Has Reggie freed Freke yet?
[0:57:56] <%A_German_spy> @X2Eliah Not yet.

[0:58:07] <Style_train_14> yes
[0:58:09] <%A_German_spy> @X2Eliah He did speak to him, though
[0:58:23] <X2Eliah> Ah, neat. And, uh... the other one?
[0:58:28] <+rogoho> Reggie jamming on that axe.
[0:58:33] <mihokspawn> HI chat, hi Woolie how is everyone?
[0:58:41] <user_naim> @equirah Dungeon with the branding wardens
[0:58:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:48] <%A_German_spy> @mihokspawn charly23Hi
[0:59:01] <DaBigVitus> meanwhile i'm over here trying to find a ps3 copy of this game
[0:59:09] <shadowcrisis> Oh who lives in a dilapidated sunken ship under the sea ? Cthulhu tentacle pants
[0:59:12] <mihokspawn> Oh @A_German_spy good to catch you here :)
[0:59:19] <smallheals> good try
[0:59:21] <%A_German_spy> @mihokspawn Wouldn't miss this.
[0:59:29] <Equirah> @user_naim oh, i thought you meant a character LUL
[0:59:32] <LVL1_Scumbag> Always sacrifice survivability for style
[0:59:44] <SmortyPuffin> the camera setup makes me feel like any minute one of them is going to lean over and give the other one a lil smooch
[1:00:04] <+cobrahaggleralt> he has the regen ring
[1:00:09] <user_naim> @equirah ”shithole” would be a fun way to refer to a person
[1:00:11] <+brickwall35> the crescent falchion recovers mp
[1:00:14] <CappuccinoGuil> The silver crown thingy in the chest
[1:00:18] <+brickwall35> if he has it out
[1:00:28] <smallheals> its weird seeing a souls player not constanly fishing for backstabs haha
[1:00:51] <%Lion_kun> Was there any item or gear that regenned mp in DS3
[1:00:59] <%Lion_kun> Other than the estus
[1:01:06] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun There was a weapon upgrade path that did, yes
[1:01:16] <BurdRightsActivist> EYYAAAUUUURRRGHHHHH PLEASE HELP ME
[1:01:18] <Wakka47> simple gem @Lion_kun
[1:01:29] <%Lion_kun> Tx spy
[1:01:37] <%Lion_kun> Tx wakka
[1:01:37] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun No worries.
[1:01:39] <+TheotherKristian> Aaaaaarghghghgh Helpu Meeee!!
[1:01:45] <deadbrainpl> @A_German_spy and the devs called you a bitch for using it because so many people relied on the Crescent falchion in DeS
[1:01:51] <Equirah> @Lion_kun there's a ring that recovers FP from critical hits
[1:01:52] <mihokspawn> @A_German_spy feeling like a Souls grandpa yet? seeing the torch being handed off again spyTea spyPraise
[1:02:01] <%A_German_spy> @deadbrainpl That, and they nerfed its synergy with weapon arts
[1:02:02] <%ozzrabbit> Hey, correct me if I’m wrong, but don’t Magic weapons regen MP in this game the same way Bleesed weapons regen HP?
[1:02:19] <%A_German_spy> @deadbrainpl because Fromsoft hates it when something is at all strong or useful
[1:02:21] <Ilkim61> @lion_kun there was also the adjudicator_shield expy from the Archdragon Peak
[1:02:38] <Equirah> @ozzrabbit crescent upgrade path, yes
[1:02:39] <deadbrainpl> The crescent path does regent MP but I don't think the other magic upgrade path does
[1:02:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Remember Footsies, Reggie
[1:02:52] <+Grayhammatter> nicely done
[1:02:54] <%Lion_kun> The worst thing about the dark souls trilogy is they nerfed the good shit
[1:03:16] <%Lion_kun> HP and MP regen became useless.
[1:03:17] <deadbrainpl> The build variety in DS3 feels really small compared to even DeS
[1:03:36] <smallheals> i would like to see woolie playing this game seeing how much he improved over the years
[1:03:40] <%holydeviant1> DS2's shining good point was that pretty much any build worked if you had decent levels
[1:03:43] <%A_German_spy> @deadbrainpl Yeah, because in DS3 Fromsoft basically pushed everyone into using nothing but Quality builds
[1:03:46] <ayexp4254> not ultra greatswords
[1:03:49] <%Lion_kun> If DS3 had free FP regeneration, it would be a much better game.
[1:03:58] <CappuccinoGuil> @deadbrainpl DS2 and DeS have the best build variety in all the games. DS3 is really weak on that front, even with all the weapon variety
[1:04:02] <DaBigVitus> there's arguments for playing og dark souls with fan patch over the enhanced one. is there one for DS2 over first sin edition?
[1:04:11] <%Double_Tap_That> @Lion_kun The Cinders mod adds that
[1:04:12] <%A_German_spy> @deadbrainpl There's next to nothing in that game for pure strength, and not all that many decent pure DEX options
[1:04:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Askin for Health Regen in Des 3 iis like asking for a gun in an airsoft match
[1:04:28] <$Invlux> @Lion_kun do I have the mod for you ;)
[1:04:29] <+askalta> battle axe reggie>?
[1:04:38] <Equirah> DS3 has the worst returns for dex/str investment, unless you want to use a weapon that can't be buffed or doesn't have a self buff you're better off investing in int/faith and buffing
[1:04:43] <deadbrainpl> I think the worst part of DS3 is that due to the high roll limit, shields being almost useless, no poise and lack of good range spells every build felt the same because you gotta roll
[1:04:43] <+bbbaobabbb> this is the crazy frog
[1:04:44] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy really bums me that "playing defensively" became a joke in Souls builds because all it did was take away options for builds. Now everyone is Quality builds only
[1:04:57] <ChungusQuest> Am I in the minority for loving DS2's small white soapstone?
[1:04:58] <%Lion_kun> I know Cinders mod adds that but I'm not a fan of the enemy shuffling.
[1:05:02] <+Grayhammatter> MEATBALL
[1:05:04] <%Juriasu> Naaaa nanananana
[1:05:07] <%blastyoboots> bets on how long before he remembers to enchant his weapon? before the boss maybe? a few deaths in?
[1:05:08] <BurdRightsActivist> REGGITH
[1:05:11] <deadbrainpl> PRISONER BALL NANANANAN
[1:05:11] <%ekodrop> knew it
[1:05:12] <%Lion_kun> I wanna play vanilla ds3 with fp regen.
[1:05:13] <%A_German_spy> @deadbrainpl That's definitely an issue too
[1:05:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Alll Builds should be roll builds
[1:05:19] <Pookiedaexzile> in fact
[1:05:20] <smallheals> gotta see it coming haha
[1:05:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Take out sheilds
[1:05:25] <$Invlux> @Lion_kun Entirely fair, it's a whole different experience
[1:05:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Umbasa
[1:05:36] <%ChoculaUltra> fist build with fp regen in ds3 is mad fun
[1:05:37] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Prism Stones could help shorten the way back to the boss if Reggie still getting his bearings
[1:05:39] <Pookiedaexzile> give me a gun, and let me get my health back for hitting enemies oh wait
[1:05:39] <%Lion_kun> I would actually use weapon arts for one thing.
[1:05:39] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil Some of that comes from Fromsoft's ill-advised attempts to nerf everything they viewed as overpowered
[1:05:57] <%ekodrop> lol the long way is now the shortcut
[1:05:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:06:01] <deadbrainpl> Plus DS3 really feels like an awkward middle point between DS1 and Bloodborne too
[1:06:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy translation: people hated fun, so they pestered Fromsoft to remove the fun.
[1:06:05] <%ChoculaUltra> did Bluepoint explain why the changed the icon on the Cat's Ring LUL
[1:06:08] <skyentombment> Are all these issues not solved with the cinders mod?
[1:06:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the fun room
[1:06:29] <Pookiedaexzile> The issue is some people are bad at bloodborne
[1:06:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the hentai room
[1:06:41] <Johannen> Elden Ring gonna be like Sekiro..only 1 weapon)
[1:06:43] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil It was honestly more Fromsoft's priority as it was the people who complained. Fromsoft is a tiny company and they don't really pay attention to the feedback they get from outside of Japan.
[1:06:43] <smallheals> NICE reggy
[1:06:44] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[1:06:52] <BurdRightsActivist> The issue is some people want to play dark souls but not diet bloodborne 4Head
[1:06:54] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil They came to those conclusions mostly on their own.
[1:07:13] <%Lion_kun> THAT WAS SO LUCKY
[1:07:21] <Pookiedaexzile> I'd Take a Diet Bloodborne
[1:07:23] <X2Eliah> Here's hoping that elden ring will turn back to the ds1 style of gameplay pacing
[1:07:29] <Pookiedaexzile> shit I want bloodborne zero now
[1:07:35] <shadowcrisis> Bloodbourne is far superior to the Dark souls series
[1:07:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy that hurts my brain. But considering how lacking Bloodborne was with builds and how hard DS3 pushed into Quality only, Elden Ring's future scares me
[1:07:37] <shadowcrisis> deal with it
[1:07:39] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So now, you guys can send the Battle Axe back home since you've tried it out a bit. Great Club for the next few encounters, you think?

[1:08:38] <%A_German_spy> @CappuccinoGuil All we can do is wait and see. At this point, I'm not sure Elden Ring is even real.
[1:08:44] <user_naim> Prison of Holy shit who made this floor plan?
[1:08:45] <shadowcrisis> let it get a new game on the ps5 or a remake like demons souls...what are ya gonna complain about then

[1:10:08] <jorniev> ITS NOT YOUR FAULT REGGIE

[1:10:27] <jorniev> this FLOOR PLAN was made by fucking octopus people!
[1:10:32] <+patriotrenegade> You say that but that Yakuza vid says otherwise
[1:10:34] <LtSurge> What armour is that ?
[1:10:35] <%Amaideus> Gravity is the only Souls boss you can never have a winning matchup against
[1:10:44] <%Amaideus> At best you just continue to go even
[1:10:48] <%Lion_kun> Starboard reggie.
[1:10:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "I don't care!" THAT'S RIGHT
[1:10:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @LtSurge imperial spy armor, apparently a new addition to the game
[1:10:51] <+patriotrenegade> The camera in this game is atrocious
[1:10:53] <user_naim> That IS an alien
[1:10:58] <skyentombment> These are NPCs, no point in fighting these fair
[1:11:29] <shadowcrisis> @patriotrenegade just like the camera in Reisdent evil
[1:11:38] <deadbrainpl> That is an....aeeeeeelieeeen
[1:11:56] <+Grayhammatter> illiythid hours
[1:12:05] <Lancaster_H> real lost hours
[1:12:06] <%ChoculaUltra> camera angles and video games will always be at odds with eachother
[1:12:10] <X2Eliah> Over/under on Reggie beating Fool's Idol today?
[1:12:13] <jorniev> this part reminds me of the library in bloodborne
[1:12:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He can do it
[1:12:42] <CappuccinoGuil> But why go here if he can just go through the bridge?
[1:12:45] <BurdRightsActivist> @X2Eliah Not if he gets jebaited over and over and woolie says nothing
[1:12:52] <CappuccinoGuil> DAMN IT
[1:12:56] <+patriotrenegade> @shadowcrisis I fucking hate this camera, it’s dead center on your character and blocks your view of enemies. In the original and in every other Soulsborne, the camera is slightly above your character and offset to the side giving you better vantage.
[1:12:57] <CappuccinoGuil> nearly killed him with the bleed

[1:22:07] <user_naim> This kind of reminds of my old school. Shitty green lights and everything. Like one usable staircase
[1:22:09] <deadbrainpl> As it should be
[1:22:17] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus don't forget, a lot of people who play these games are used to genres where the map is hard to read or useless, so internal mapping is a skill we built up. No shame in taking your time SeemsGood
[1:22:27] <lejeune> ANELE
[1:22:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 2, 3, 1. 23 is number 1!

[1:23:43] <deadbrainpl> Those backstabs...he's gonna be ready for DS1 woolieMIRIN
[1:23:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Seeing Reggie learning the little tricks is so great.
[1:23:50] <+kevlarkoala> somebody skillful, I have a new meme idea: that haniball burress meme, but with a bunch of tentacles and it says "zap". MAKE IT HAPPEN
[1:24:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Did he clap the idol?
[1:24:20] <+FuzzyGuru> oh hey, I've been following this on youtube! We're not punching skeletons anymore! Way to go!
[1:24:20] <lejeune> no
[1:24:22] <deadbrainpl> The idol clapped him
[1:24:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> guess not
[1:24:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus people internalize things differently. Like, I think of swings, not damage, in the combat here. "2 clean swings; 1 backstab and 2 swings." same with mapping.
[1:24:22] <+Grayhammatter> no, he got clapped by the idol
[1:24:23] <%A_German_spy> @BallerSwagBro9k Not yet, but he's close
[1:24:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh man, Fool's Idol was laughing at me at church this Sunday :(
[1:24:46] <%ekodrop> hold to skip?
[1:24:49] <%BisoromiBear> shamed in front of God and everybody
[1:24:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The cutscene plays every time?
[1:24:50] <X2Eliah> Well, he now knows that the idol duplicates, so Reggie knows all the tricks of the boss, really
[1:24:50] <ChungusQuest> aw man, not in front of the Monumentals!
[1:24:51] <+chiazam> So this is what Pat meant about bosses being more puzzle than boss in these games
[1:24:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> How long have they been playing?

[1:25:36] <+Undenizen> Reggie, get tested for that shit *now*
[1:25:43] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario I mean, they're slightly weaker against fire, but magic still does acceptable damage to them

[1:31:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus AIN'T IT? spyCappa
[1:31:46] <cosmicgoatee> This is rather illithid behavior Reggarth

[1:35:51] <+LordCasante> I had to leave for an hour did Reggie do the "thing"?
[1:35:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Okay, that was not how she was supposed to vanish
[1:35:59] <%cvp5127> hayai
[1:36:01] <X2Eliah> The random stumbling mobs can reveal the traps, right
[1:36:04] <%Amaideus> Also they're always in the same place

[1:36:40] <X2Eliah> FEET. THE TELL IS THE FEET
[1:36:42] <Solidnick18> yeah it was i think
[1:36:45] <BlackermanZX> ohhh
[1:36:50] <+chiazam> It'd be realllllll funny if he beats the boss without ever figuring out
[1:36:50] <therealtacopancakes> nice kinda tip from woolie
[1:36:52] <+Graxe_> I feel like one of the tells was easier to notice in the original
[1:36:56] <lejeune> reggie is blind
[1:37:00] <%cache_22> Reggarth is falling for all these false idols.
[1:37:06] <+Graxe_> it's still here and you can see it
[1:37:06] <%jepupu> Reggie too concentrated woolieKICKDAD
[1:37:18] <+Grayhammatter> oh no reggie
[1:37:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> I wonder if a magic shield would be worthwhile for this fight
[1:37:20] <%Amaideus> IIRC the real one shoots a bigger bolt than the others, but I don't remember
[1:37:27] <MadBaller123> Its hard to tell in the middle of the action tbh
[1:37:27] <X2Eliah> yep
[1:37:28] <Josef_Stryker> That's one tell
