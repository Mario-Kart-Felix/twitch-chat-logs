[0:06:49] <LiteraryFirearms> ARMS is a really creative take on 3D fighters. It definitely could've used more attention ^^

[0:08:05] <rustedfish> ARMS 2: TIME FOR HEAD
[0:08:10] <blackkanye> Chat doesn't have enough feet jokes. I'm actually sad right now
[0:08:11] <Dragon_Batman> Yoo, Arms was super dope
[0:08:16] <LiteraryFirearms> Yeah, ARMS has that classic vibe of easy to learn, hard to master. Approachable controls but more complex than it first appears.
[0:08:16] <Solidnick18> discover the tech
[0:08:22] <+IncredibleMeh> Of which I was also one of only three Springtron mains in existence
[0:08:23] <+Metaternal> Sweet I'm just in time for Helix
[0:08:24] <@Menitta> Minmin is the best.
[0:08:28] <blackkanye> What unironically happened to ARMS?
[0:08:31] <Dragon_Batman> Assist yea
[0:08:32] <%Wool> so are you saying if I beat IncredibleMeh I'll be the best
[0:08:33] <+ApocalypticExpress> @blackkanye It wouldn't be feet it'd be LEGD

[0:08:48] <+IncredibleMeh> IF you ever beat me, Wool
[0:08:48] <+AstroNinja0> Game just went the way of the obscure IP. Nothing too dramatic
[0:08:52] <Prevot> the smash rep should be twintelle instead of springman anyway

[0:14:22] <dapperskeleton69> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:14:28] <DontChuckle98> You might need to attach the joycons to the controller grip attachment.
[0:14:28] <featherlan> Man, back when I was in the Navy, this was my GAAAAME
[0:14:40] <Dragon_Batman> I guess it just forces that setting when it detects joy cons at all?
[0:14:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Oh no, hot clown waifu

[0:21:25] <%tearfuldevil> minmin is cute, but i can't take the spring arms
[0:21:25] <+AstroNinja0> Twintelle's actually a top tier pick btw
[0:21:28] <featherlan> *dashing
[0:21:34] <gamemastertom> twintelle: hold dash to use her aura to slow attacks near her
[0:21:35] <resloxxx> guard too IIRC

[0:21:43] <+SleeplessRhythme> Is Woolie still playing Rocket League?
[0:21:43] <@Menitta> Minmin is like that guy in Apollo Justice
[0:21:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Reggie prefers the feet
[0:21:43] <+chiluzza> blessed is the booty
[0:21:43] <Dragon_Batman> Babam
[0:21:44] <Gutsandlove> doodLewd
[0:21:44] <Mahbonk> that superb booty
[0:21:44] <TheDrown> Min Min's arm is perma charged when she fully charges up
[0:21:48] <Solidnick18> those cheeks clap
[0:21:49] <+Blurry15> thunderbird parasol woolie
[0:21:52] <%GinAndRoses> this the booty character
[0:21:53] <+R_BChe> the nintendo patent ass

[0:21:57] <rustedfish> boom booty
[0:22:02] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:22:03] <gamemastertom> min min: grabbing or charging gives her a dragon left arm, permacharge until knockdown, air dashes and backdash deflects
[0:22:06] <ScarfDeSmith> dnoGEESE 👍
[0:22:11] <MayorRev> wowee
[0:22:14] <Dragon_Batman> I think the charges of those punches do special things
[0:22:29] <%augusm> I feel like playing Twintelle leaves you at a distinct disadvantage due the the presence of the ass
[0:22:32] <NeroInfinite> The booty is LITERALLY the first thing everybody noticed on twintell
[0:22:42] <@Menitta> I love that art of Minmin eating the noodles. it's so good
[0:22:42] <MayorRev> is all about dat BUTT
[0:22:44] <%Irridium> when min min charges her left arm get super charged and lasts for a while
[0:22:46] <%SirGO0SE> dang i missed the start
[0:22:54] <%SirGO0SE> hows it going so far
[0:22:57] <Thunderhog> Rip the dragon arm
[0:23:01] <dapperskeleton69> so far so good

[0:23:02] <LiteraryFirearms> pattycake!
[0:23:07] <Dragon_Batman> You didn't miss too much
[0:23:08] <dapperskeleton69> already saw both fetish characters
[0:23:09] <resloxxx> just started, right off the tutorial
[0:23:15] <+chiluzza> i lvoe twintelle she can be so aggressive
[0:23:22] <gamemastertom> also, min min's attacks have the smallest hitboxes, but the dragon arm is one of the biggest
[0:23:22] <%SirGO0SE> dang at missing the fetish tho
[0:23:26] <+IncredibleMeh> Yo Reggie you gotta hold that dash button!
[0:23:29] <Gutsandlove> @SirGO0SE just started
[0:23:36] <+Blurry15> Thunderbird stuns
[0:23:45] <%augusm> ffs I read "Choose your ARMS" as "Choose your ASS"
[0:23:46] <%SirGO0SE> nice :)
[0:23:55] <@Menitta> Oh yeah I forgot Arms has the best lore in anything
[0:23:56] <LiteraryFirearms> nice shield parries already!
[0:23:59] <NeroInfinite> Bluebird is kinda funky
[0:24:06] <%GinAndRoses> au revior

[0:24:26] <rustedfish> twintelle for ARMS 2: HEAD
[0:24:27] <MutedMimic> spookyHype You dont
[0:24:28] <%SirGO0SE> I wish Nintendo gave a bigger shit about this game
[0:24:30] <dapperskeleton69> the ass acts as a bacj shield lmao
[0:24:30] <Gutsandlove> EXTRA THICC

[0:24:34] <@Solidus_113> god I wish that were me

[0:24:39] <Solidnick18> woolieGASM
[0:24:43] <DontChuckle98> Pfft! Lol
[0:24:45] <CyrusVGZ> I might have to go download the demo for this again.
[0:24:47] <%Irridium> I mean if it did I wouldn't complain
[0:24:50] <Dragon_Batman> Just killed Reggie
[0:24:53] <+Blurry15> ARMS deserves more love
[0:24:58] <YakumoYomi> Pull over, that ass is too phat.
[0:24:58] <G03933> hows he suppose to fight when hes staring at your screen the whole time? Kappa
[0:24:59] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Mechanica's a CUTE, DR COYLE Kreygasm
[0:25:02] <resloxxx> star puratinum
[0:25:03] <+AstroNinja0> Mah GIRL
[0:25:03] <DontChuckle98> Chop 3 thirds of that ass.
[0:25:07] <LiteraryFirearms> @Menitta in canon, ARMS are a gene that just randomly activate one day and then you just kinda have to deal with having spring arms
[0:25:07] <Solidnick18> Dr coyle looks cool
[0:25:10] <featherlan> Dr. Coyle lowkey is my main
[0:25:11] <%Wool> NINJA COLLEGE
[0:25:12] <aka_Jigawatt> I wish this game didnt die FeelsBadMan
[0:25:13] <Gutsandlove> She is cool
[0:25:14] <MayorRev> JOJO man
[0:25:15] <Mahbonk> i can confirm that booty can kill
[0:25:15] <NeroInfinite> aztec warriah
[0:25:20] <Mahbonk> as i am dead
[0:25:23] <@Menitta> it's so good lmao
[0:25:31] <+jetjagger222> star platinum!
[0:25:36] <mr_miyagucci> smash is for good girls and boys but arms is for men and women Kappa
[0:25:37] <+marrs_bars> 3/3 = quickmaths sbfpRichard
[0:25:37] <dapperskeleton69> i too can confirm booty kills
[0:25:37] <%SirGO0SE> the assist trophy snub in smash hurt. i thought we'd see arms in opening roster =/
[0:25:44] <Solidnick18> stone masks Kappa
[0:25:45] <+robobeau> It is a crime they never put Little Mac as a DLC character
[0:25:53] <CyrusVGZ> This stage favors whoever is at the top. It's insane lol.\
[0:25:57] <rustedfish> pillar man theme plays
[0:25:58] <Thunderhog> Main thing is that theres different weights to arms, and the heavier they are they beat out lighter arms
[0:26:11] <+cvp5127> minmin for win win
[0:26:11] <%Taglog7> woolieREMEMBERS Thiccelle
[0:26:11] <featherlan> Coyle also can straight up FLY
[0:26:12] <BalloniWright> third arm? KappaPride
[0:26:12] <+Blurry15> charge is super important
[0:26:13] <TheDrown> Coyle also turns invisible when holding block
[0:26:14] <%RioGascar> so now that dmc3 is on switch boy am i having lots of fun
[0:26:30] <@Menitta> literally the high ground
[0:26:34] <%RioGascar> wish the joycons didnt suck but at least i got pro controller
[0:26:37] <LiteraryFirearms> "I have the high ground" - literally everyone at some point on Ninja College
[0:26:40] <gamemastertom> the red mask gives Misango super armor that halves damage
[0:26:45] <YakumoYomi> Heavy characters have armor
[0:26:46] <%SirGO0SE> @robobeau with a cool megalobox rig
[0:26:47] <featherlan> AND her dodge makes her invisible
[0:26:52] <Haarute> OBI-WAN WAS RIGHT
[0:26:53] <featherlan> Coyle was nuts
[0:26:55] <dapperskeleton69> DONT TRY IT
[0:26:57] <LiteraryFirearms> Misango's the Shulk of this game, with red for armor, blue for speed, and yellow for super
[0:27:00] <+AstroNinja0> Misango's basically Alolan Shulk
[0:27:06] <gamemastertom> also, blocking with Misango turns the spirit into a pillar that blocks attacks, and touching the pillar gives you a mask
[0:27:10] <+NWR_James> this stage is savage in more than 1v1
[0:27:14] <NeroInfinite> and he's poisoned too
[0:27:15] <Thunderhog> also his base arms are ass
[0:27:31] <+AstroNinja0> Skully and Glusher are OD wym
[0:27:35] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> We got the deets in chat PogChamp
[0:27:43] <+AstroNinja0> It's Scorpio that's the weird one
[0:27:50] <+Dr_DangerPhD> this stage in 1v1v1 is a salt factory, 1 person is immediately getting double teamed lol
[0:28:00] <featherlan> Coyle's default ARMS are ridiculous
[0:28:06] <TheDrown> Air scorpion is better than ground imo
[0:28:09] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> I want a megalobox character. No ARMS just boxing.
[0:28:19] <Mahbonk> OMG JC
[0:28:24] <%DensityD> a bomb
[0:28:25] <+rooked4> What timeline did I stumble into>
[0:28:34] <%DensityD> woolieGLORY
[0:28:35] <Thunderhog> Back away from the meter zone
[0:28:36] <%Irridium> that gives you super LUL
[0:28:49] <Mahbonk> No it's protein . Eez good for you
[0:28:52] <+NWR_James> Power Up Backdowns
[0:28:55] <powerprotoman> reggie picked the boss character
[0:28:57] <Solidnick18> good job
[0:29:02] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also you can expand the range of the throw if you spread the arms out, but you make it easier to break
[0:29:03] <%Irridium> yellow circles generate super for everyone in them, green generates health
[0:29:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> COYLE Kreygasm
[0:29:18] <blackkanye> I was gone. What is his mechanic?
[0:29:20] <Mahbonk> God she's cool and edgy
[0:29:22] <%DensityD> GOO DNA Kreygasm
[0:29:25] <%tearfuldevil> well i know what i'm looking up when this stream ends
[0:29:25] <+AstroNinja0> Captain Almight looking dude
[0:29:26] <featherlan> Who
[0:29:27] <gamemastertom> the 4 ítems in battles are: fire bomb, shock bomb, health juice and rush juice
[0:29:30] <NeroInfinite> The little buddy can betray you if you let the opponent get the drops.
[0:29:34] <Gutsandlove> maximillian on da house
[0:29:35] <Solidnick18> Yeeyee doggo
[0:30:01] <+Dr_DangerPhD> byte and barq has some interesting stuff you can set up, tricky to play against
[0:30:07] <Dapper_Cactuar> Brass is a boss character
[0:30:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:30:17] <LiteraryFirearms> !twitter

[0:30:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Awww the robit dog is so cute LUL
[0:30:21] <Mahbonk> pupper
[0:30:24] <%DensityD> we Astral Chain now?
[0:30:28] <dapperskeleton69> PUPPER SNUFFER
[0:30:32] <Solidnick18> come on doggo
[0:30:55] <gamemastertom> fun fact, byte and barq cheated their way into the ARMS grand Prix by pretending to be one carácter (barq turns into the head during rushes)
[0:31:07] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> LUL
[0:31:10] <+IncredibleMeh> No no not jumping is GOOD
[0:31:10] <%DensityD> don't jump LUL
[0:31:25] <LiteraryFirearms> comeback king
[0:31:29] <NeroInfinite> BOP
[0:31:32] <LiteraryFirearms> as we say in the ARMS community, never say gg to a max brass
[0:31:41] <+AstroNinja0> Also make sure to use Grab with Brass, he has the best grab in the game
[0:31:52] <TheDrown> The arms you guys have also explode when fully charged and you get hit. So for Barq it'll stun him if gets interrupted
[0:32:09] <Thunderhog> So yeah, the thing with Max Brass is he gets X factor for free at low HP
[0:32:13] <%DensityD> YOU PUNCHED A DOG
[0:32:24] <%DensityD> dog punches you
[0:32:33] <Dragon_Batman> Free X factor is nuts
[0:32:42] <gamemastertom> btw, all characters have 1000HP
[0:33:01] <@Menitta> I wish Little Mac was in this
[0:33:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I couldn't tell on the HP at first, I thought Max Brass had a shit ton for a second there lol
[0:33:22] <gamemastertom> Max gets super armor when at 25% HP left
[0:33:24] <%Irridium> that's the dash into charge
[0:33:25] <%DensityD> big = slow
[0:33:29] <+IncredibleMeh> OH GOD
[0:33:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Reggie's pullin out the giant torpedo arms
[0:34:03] <%DensityD> yes, that was heals
[0:34:04] <LiteraryFirearms> The health bottle makes a healing zone!
[0:34:19] <gamemastertom> i remember the earlier days when people thought master mummy was OP because 5 grabs were enough to KO (he does 200 damage)
[0:34:24] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Powerup Backdown: The Backdownening KappaRoss
[0:34:27] <+IncredibleMeh> Items...Giant Arms... NotLikeThis
[0:34:36] <%DensityD> woolieFUN
[0:34:41] <TheDrown> Also takes varying amounts of punches to stop an incoming punch. Like light arm vs heavy will take multiple light punches but heavy vs heavy will cancel out in one
[0:34:41] <SebTheFuturist> YO WE TAKIN’ UP ARMS IN HERE?! lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU

[0:36:16] <%DensityD> FEED
[0:36:17] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The slimegirls are failing Reggie
[0:36:19] <CyrusVGZ> My uncle's cat works at EVO and says there's gonna be a secret main stage tournament for ARMS and Pokken
[0:36:28] <premmylive> It’s harder to jump over arms with vertical hitboxes
[0:36:36] <premmylive> Than horizontal ones
[0:36:39] <+rooked4> Those arms are a no for me
[0:36:46] <%Irridium> you have to dodge into it
[0:36:56] <+fizzguy47> vin diesel is senator armstrong
[0:36:59] <%DensityD> big = slow but maybe more curving
[0:37:04] <CyrusVGZ> Mechanica a cute.
[0:37:06] <MutedMimic> Bonk
[0:37:14] <NeroInfinite> Guardian is more for defense
[0:37:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[0:37:16] <@Menitta> i remember the slime guy being really good at launch
[0:37:19] <+IncredibleMeh> Making arms bigger is just a thing for funning around
[0:37:28] <+IncredibleMeh> Also size as almost nothing to do with actual speed
[0:37:29] <YakumoYomi> Bad arm selection
[0:37:32] <gamemastertom> hélix ARMS are a bit on the hard side, guardian specially
[0:37:33] <Solidnick18> a perfect
[0:37:34] <%DensityD> baby's first rushdown
[0:37:41] <%tearfuldevil> true perfect
[0:37:43] <Dragon_Batman> Quite literally making a shield
[0:37:44] <%tearfuldevil> got ppd
[0:37:47] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Gooboy RIP
[0:37:52] <Solidnick18> master mummy
[0:37:52] <+rooked4> Helix is a tough one
[0:37:57] <%DensityD> EVEN MORE ASTRAL CHAIN
[0:37:58] <Thunderhog> The chain link glasses are great
[0:37:59] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Woolie just wants the Boruto
[0:38:01] <NeroInfinite> but yeah Helix is pretty hard
[0:38:05] <dapperskeleton69> MUMMIES ALIVE

[0:38:23] <dapperskeleton69> WOOOOO
[0:38:55] <premmylive> Almost every character gimmick involves charging somehow so play with that every time
[0:39:04] <Thunderhog> SourPls
[0:39:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Git em with that big grab Reggie
[0:39:43] <G03933> is this the part in the Ninja battle where you flashback for 6 episodes?
[0:39:47] <dapperskeleton69> just keep schmovin
[0:40:02] <+rooked4> hold block
[0:40:15] <BackwardCap> All the music in this game is underrated too. Soundtrack goes hard.
[0:40:19] <%DensityD> when do we sit on the swing and flute-chan plays?
[0:40:23] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Reggie with the big birds
[0:40:26] <%SirGO0SE> foosies with our handsies
[0:40:38] <%DensityD> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsMic
[0:41:02] <LiteraryFirearms> birds are mysterious creatures
[0:41:02] <BackwardCap> You can never guard a throw LUL
[0:41:09] <%DensityD> GI GI
[0:41:13] <gamemastertom> yeah, blocking can stop 25 attacks, iirc, before breaking
[0:41:20] <MutedMimic> LuL
[0:41:23] <cocovett> charge ya triblaaaaast
[0:41:25] <SixthSun2> THE READS
[0:41:27] <LiteraryFirearms> yeah, classic rock paper scissors there. Guard beats punch, punch beats grab, grab beats guard.
[0:41:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> THE SPD
[0:41:41] <Thunderhog> Se, the mind game doesnt work if woolie doesnt know how to throw
[0:41:54] <%Irridium> reggie gotta use that super
[0:42:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Mummy protecting the egyptian skies
[0:42:03] <%jiggy_snipe> make something happen, gets punched in face
[0:42:05] <Thunderhog> The mine game is guard the whole time, force a throw, and punish the throw
[0:42:09] <featherlan> "8 seconds to make something happen"
[0:42:10] <%DensityD> THAT'S ONE HELL OF A RINNEGAN
[0:42:11] <featherlan> OOF
[0:42:15] <%DensityD> or Sharringan

[0:51:30] <MayorRev> What's this about?
[0:51:30] <%Irridium> what platform
[0:51:33] <BackwardCap> The main problem with this game is that its more fun to play than it is to watch.
[0:51:34] <SebTheFuturist> Here’s to hoping for an Arms 2 that catapults the franchise into the limelight like the Sequel System did for Street Fighter.
[0:51:37] <%DensityD> copy a code
[0:51:37] <+balouie> I reallly liked arms even though I was crappy at it
[0:51:43] <Mahbonk> @SirGO0SE sadly Sprinman and Rex were "too late" apparently
[0:51:45] <BackwardCap> And that there isn't a lot of variance in the gameplay.
[0:51:50] <Solidnick18> well that's fine

[1:01:59] <jerocus> Arms was fun I just didn’t get that into it
[1:02:12] <%DensityD> ARMS
[1:02:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> arms has a lot of tech
[1:02:16] <+chiluzza> damn this game got lots of techs
[1:02:17] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Short hops and short asses
[1:02:19] <%SirGO0SE> ARMS for evo
[1:02:24] <worldbrand> crumpet dashing pog
[1:02:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> it was a side tournament i think
[1:02:35] <+sinistersally> Needs Turbo mode
[1:02:43] <gamemastertom> props to JBPro for these videos
[1:02:52] <Dragon_Batman> Videos seem short enough
[1:02:59] <CyrusVGZ> Everyone take out your notebooks
[1:03:00] <%tearfuldevil> its fine lol
[1:03:18] <PleasantLeech> like most fighting games I feel like there's good mechanics but no real game for me to do anything with them. If I had someone to play with maybe it'd be different.
[1:03:29] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:03:34] <%DensityD> SwiftRage but what the fuck is a 6 2 3 6 C?
[1:03:53] <Dragon_Batman> But what about hammering the buttons and wiggling the sticks? Kappa
[1:04:00] <MayorRev> Are these official or fanmade tip videos?
[1:04:18] <+AstroNinja0> Fan made vids
[1:04:22] <MayorRev> ooooh
[1:04:27] <+IncredibleMeh> Big grabs are also not always better since they're way easier to punch through
[1:04:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Real nicely made
[1:04:31] <MayorRev> they look official! Very well made
[1:04:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> OH Meh's in the chat @WoolieVersus
[1:04:53] <gamemastertom> @MayorRev yeah, JBPro, who made the videos, put a lot of effort

[1:05:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:05:20] <Solidnick18> Yooo captain
[1:05:20] <Dragon_Batman> Piledriving them gift subs
[1:05:23] <ScarfDeSmith> holy shit dnoMACHO
[1:05:24] <RadicalWeegee> Oh shiiit
[1:05:27] <Solidnick18> big sub bomb
[1:05:31] <NeroInfinite> Clap
[1:05:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> my tax returns were very nice this year
[1:05:53] <MattoBii> the dog randomly barfs out a punch, I think
[1:05:53] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Oh damn, i got bombed
[1:05:55] <RadicalWeegee> YOUR NICE
[1:05:56] <%DensityD> BarQ is passive, right?
[1:05:56] <Jathspuh> I think he just does stuff
[1:06:01] <Jathspuh> on his own
[1:06:06] <gamemastertom> barq punches every 5 seconds, or 1 second after you attack
[1:06:14] <Solidnick18> sweet
[1:06:26] <Solidnick18> chaining
[1:07:17] <Dragon_Batman> Right is charged it looks
[1:07:37] <%DensityD> ice max brass all day erry day
[1:08:07] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus loadouts can be customized, from what i've been told. any character can sue any ARM, afaik
[1:08:11] <+IncredibleMeh> I've fought Brass with Chilla and it is hellish
[1:08:16] <dr_healsgood> is there still no arms character in smash?
[1:08:28] <Dragon_Batman> Nah just SpringMan as an assist
[1:08:28] <%tearfuldevil> jsut an assist trophy
[1:08:29] <%Irridium> nope but don't worry there's another fire emblem
[1:08:41] <dr_healsgood> @Irridium TRU
[1:09:00] <%DensityD> JUST FRAME
[1:09:03] <featherlan> What would be an ARMS character's gimmick?
[1:09:10] <%DensityD> snakes
[1:09:14] <%DensityD> dna strands
[1:09:27] <%DensityD> the mummy heals slowly while blocking
[1:09:36] <%DensityD> you mean in smash?
[1:09:41] <featherlan> Yee
[1:09:43] <Jathspuh> That dash out of shield has some other technical uses too
[1:09:54] <Jathspuh> empowers the next move type of thing
[1:10:09] <PleasantLeech> imagine how much better this game would be if these tutorials were in it?
[1:10:28] <Jathspuh> ^
[1:10:40] <Jathspuh> Might be on a mobile app LUL
[1:10:43] <featherlan> I guess a Smash ARMS character could charge their standard moves for a quick second
[1:11:03] <NeroInfinite> we watchin youtube on twitch what a world
[1:11:16] <Dragon_Batman> Well smash hits are already charged so that just works
[1:11:39] <%SirGO0SE> bubb
[1:11:45] <featherlan> No, I mean aside from smash attacks
[1:11:55] <featherlan> Like.... their neutral jab
[1:12:04] <Jathspuh> @NeroInfinite that's how the big streams make the easiest money
[1:12:05] <featherlan> OH
[1:12:19] <featherlan> The charge gives one of the element boosts
[1:12:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:20] <%tearfuldevil> @NeroInfinite its been super common for years, lol
[1:12:34] <Dragon_Batman> Would be neat either way
[1:12:53] <MindlessMonks> daaamn
[1:13:19] <%DensityD> punishes
[1:13:28] <%Razputin217> @CaptainPileDriver Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:13:31] <NeroInfinite> If only these tutorials were in the game to begin with
[1:13:37] <featherlan> They could have just as big of a recovery as Bleth
[1:13:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Razputin217 no problem
[1:14:01] <Jathspuh> i didn't know that PogChamp
[1:14:32] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh wow
[1:14:40] <+IncredibleMeh> Good tutorials always make the difference for how accessible a fighting game is, even one like this
[1:15:03] <featherlan> True
[1:15:05] <%Irridium> I mean it makes sense. If your arm's fucked up blocking not gonna be great
[1:15:29] <Dragon_Batman> Makes sense
[1:15:33] <Thunderhog> What do you mean you cant block moves with 1 finger?
[1:15:38] <Thunderhog> What are you, weak?
[1:15:38] <PleasantLeech> these tutorials are insanely high quality for being fan made
[1:15:51] <featherlan> Wait. What would the range be for an ARMS Smash rep? XD
[1:15:53] <Dragon_Batman> NAh block it with your face
[1:15:59] <%DensityD> I'm almost mad that getting a broken arm will weaken my movement too
[1:16:05] <%DensityD> they disabled my ARM not my LEG
[1:16:17] <%DensityD> but these are special characters
[1:16:24] <premmylive> Arms I smash =Belmont/Lil Mac
[1:16:32] <premmylive> So!
[1:16:36] <premmylive> Arms Lore!
[1:16:41] <Dragon_Batman> Sword character range then?
[1:16:43] <Run44forrest> whens LEGS
[1:16:50] <featherlan> But their arm stretchy
[1:16:50] <%DensityD> EXPLOSION IS SUPER RISKY
[1:17:02] <%Irridium> high risk high reward baby
[1:17:03] <featherlan> LONG RANGE MELEE
[1:17:05] <premmylive> The arms ability is like the X-gene
[1:17:14] <+Someone_Kooky> Is ARMS alive?
[1:17:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @featherlan it would be another belmont character basically
[1:17:17] <Dragon_Batman> I would make em like Belmonts or Corrin like
[1:17:21] <premmylive> Randomly happens to people at any point in their life
[1:17:26] <premmylive> Or even after death
[1:17:30] <premmylive> Like master mummy
[1:17:42] <premmylive> Who woke up one day in a museum
[1:17:42] <featherlan> @CaptainPileDriver Safe mid-range then?
[1:17:49] <featherlan> Just with faster hits
[1:17:52] <premmylive> And entered the tournament to find his family
[1:18:06] <%tearfuldevil> long range good smashes, but with a retracitng hitbox?
[1:18:13] <featherlan> OOOOOHHHHHH
[1:18:17] <featherlan> That's GOOD
[1:18:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> @featherlan maybe, and then some of the specials would be long range reaching and the smash attacks would also be long reaching
[1:18:22] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:18:32] <premmylive> When you manifest ARMS ABILTY your arms go crazy nuts
[1:18:35] <%DensityD> you were too busy talking about risky, you missed a part of "priming your explosive arms, thus keeping you safe with good timing"
[1:18:36] <premmylive> With no control
[1:18:39] <+AstroNinja0> Speaking of Lore, lots of the doing (like mummy's resurrection were the doing of Dr. Coyle
[1:18:45] <%SirGO0SE> psaBig quality
[1:18:47] <featherlan> An ARMS rep would have the BEST grab
[1:18:55] <featherlan> BET
[1:18:55] <Thunderhog> So the biggest trick is not to punch directly, but to cut them off with your punches to where they're moving
[1:18:59] <Run44forrest> wtf this isnt the in game tutorial???
[1:19:03] <%DensityD> Dr Coyle and Dr Wily team up when?
[1:19:04] <RAH001> they do other games?
[1:19:05] <%tearfuldevil> or like, you don't take damage, but your smashes can be disabled sort of like Robin?
[1:19:07] <premmylive> The ARMS corporation Makes everyone’s mask
[1:19:08] <Dragon_Batman> I would imagine making an arms smash character either switch arms in some way
[1:19:12] <RAH001> ah nvm
[1:19:16] <premmylive> Which allows them to control their powers
[1:19:22] <+AstroNinja0> And it's also hinted at that Dr. Coyle may be the mother of the main guy, Spring Man
[1:19:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[1:19:23] <%DensityD> thank you, ARMS Study Lab
[1:19:28] <@Solidus_113> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZKwYfg185LNBgAif4bT_Q
[1:19:30] <+sinistersally> psaBig psaWhat
[1:19:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> @featherlan sadly the arms rep was put into the assist trophy
[1:19:43] <Thunderhog> It was like a week 2 launch title doh
[1:19:44] <premmylive> Some people say Max Brass is his dad
[1:19:45] <%Irridium> game sold 2 million
[1:19:53] <MattoBii> I think it just had a lacking tail, like people weren't coming back for later character additions
[1:19:58] <+rooked4> It didnt have any ... legs
[1:19:58] <JangCarangers> i kinda miss ARMS
[1:19:58] <gamemastertom> thia game was released 3 months after the switch released
[1:19:59] <Thunderhog> So it took a bit to come out, when BotW was right there
[1:19:59] <Solidnick18> true
[1:20:01] <%DensityD> SwiftRage SHUT UP I LIKE RED STEEL 2 BabyRage
[1:20:02] <featherlan> I KNOW... -n-
[1:20:02] <%Irridium> yo Red Steel 2 was the shit though
[1:20:05] <+Dr_DangerPhD> seems like at high level its about disabling 1 arm, then doing a mixup confirm into rush
[1:20:12] <%Gasgrave> I don't think people realize how good or deep this game actually is
[1:20:13] <Mahbonk> They tried to do content dripping like Splatoon and that didnèt worked as much
[1:20:13] <PleasantLeech> well it's just a fighting game and it's exclusive to what many see as a underpowered console
[1:20:19] <%Wool> Woolie been playing ARMS so much that his BUTT hurts
[1:20:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's true
[1:20:21] <+sinistersally> @DensityD red steel 1 tho
[1:20:30] <Dragon_Batman> Maaan Red steel 1
[1:20:33] <featherlan> I really hope ARMS gets a sequel
[1:20:37] <%DensityD> LEGS
[1:20:38] <%SirGO0SE> red steel was farted out
[1:20:41] <premmylive> Red Steel for Switch when?
[1:20:43] <MattoBii> Red Steel and Twilight Princess were launch day
[1:20:44] <gamemastertom> ARMS was actually the best selling console fighter in Japan since 2014, only surpassed by smash
[1:20:48] <chronoxgp> i played at launch then completely stopped
[1:20:49] <GarbageNirvana> Twilight Princess was launch, yeah
[1:20:49] <Gutsandlove> red steel 2 is awesome
[1:20:55] <GarbageNirvana> I should know because I stood in line for that shit
[1:21:05] <+sinistersally> Red Steel 2 Great. Red Steal 1 fart
[1:21:05] <MattoBii> Red Steel 2 is a way better game, but it got slept on because Red Steel 1 was bad
[1:21:08] <+AstroNinja0> High level is more about good movement and looking for ways to play it safe. Top level play in ARMS is all of that plus good counterpicking, and meter management.
[1:21:11] <Mahbonk> look at him groove
[1:21:15] <+AstroNinja0> I say this from experience
[1:21:18] <%Ninestempest> 2 was fine
[1:21:24] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, I was at the Times Square release and got Twilight for Wii
[1:21:32] <worldbrand> this game just loves mixing its main theme eh
[1:21:37] <%Ninestempest> it definitely had all right swordplay which is all you could really ask for but everything else about it was not great
[1:21:38] <Dragon_Batman> Such a huge line
[1:21:44] <featherlan> The ARMS theme is gold
[1:21:47] <Mahbonk> Leaf Motif
[1:21:51] <featherlan> The OSTof this game is fantastic
[1:22:02] <+JohnMarkley> hello everyone :) /
[1:22:11] <Dragon_Batman> Heyo
[1:22:17] <%DensityD> hi

[1:22:48] <featherlan> Y'know what?
[1:22:57] <%DensityD> chicken butt?
[1:22:57] <PleasantLeech> EXTRA
[1:23:00] <Dragon_Batman> This vids are nicely done
[1:23:02] <featherlan> I think I'm gonna try to get ARMS into the local fray
[1:23:10] <premmylive> ArmsStudyLab the GOAT
[1:23:12] <Thunderhog> These are actually in the style of the in game tutorials, so their ability to copy them is really impressive
[1:23:14] <%DensityD> RETRACTION PogChamp
[1:23:55] <featherlan> GOD, just IMAGINE that grab range in Smash...
[1:23:55] <%DensityD> learn that timing
[1:24:07] <premmylive> Marty grabs
[1:24:12] <premmylive> Marth
[1:24:12] <Dragon_Batman> Would be alittle different depending on the arm
[1:24:22] <chronoxgp> problem with this game is the pro controller always has the advantage over the joy con users
[1:24:23] <+IncredibleMeh> Nah reggie's got it right
[1:24:35] <%DensityD> short dash into jump
[1:24:50] <+Someone_Kooky> Yeah, you gotta wiggle a little before you get it back
[1:24:50] <PleasantLeech> who would be the character that gets into smash? I mean we can all agree spring man is on the bottom of the list right?
[1:24:59] <+Someone_Kooky> So you don’t get whacked
[1:25:00] <%DensityD> PogChamp Head start on charging! Never stop charging!
[1:25:02] <Thunderhog> The point is once you start in recovery time, you can move in full
[1:25:03] <dapperskeleton69> joy con users= for fun, pro controller users= for glory
[1:25:03] <%Irridium> nah spring man is the most boring so he's top of the list
[1:25:10] <%Irridium> just how japan do
[1:25:11] <powerprotoman> springmans on the top of the lsit unless arms 2 makes minmin the mc
[1:25:30] <premmylive> Spring man makes the most sense but my personal choice is Kobra or Twintell
[1:25:33] <featherlan> Spring Man/Ribbon Girl
[1:25:41] <chronoxgp> should have 4 characters with different arms for the costumes
[1:25:43] <featherlan> Like Byleth when it comes to alts
[1:25:44] <%DensityD> you can not do short dash into full dash, but you could jump
[1:25:48] <premmylive> Min Min is another likely choice since she won the last party crash
[1:25:49] <PleasantLeech> ribbon girl is way better and she has actually unique mechanics
[1:25:51] <%DensityD> or walk, into full dash
[1:26:02] <powerprotoman> springman also allows easy echo fighter springtron
[1:26:08] <premmylive> Yeah
[1:26:10] <PleasantLeech> I think twintelle is one of the most popular though
[1:26:12] <%tearfuldevil> jsut make it ribbon man, with ribbon girl as an alt skin, or vice versa
[1:26:17] <chronoxgp> twin tell or the cop dude ar e cool so is the slime guy and mummy
[1:26:19] <Mvrdok_> Min Min BlessRNG
[1:26:24] <%tearfuldevil> even if my heart says twintelle or minmin
[1:26:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:25] <featherlan> How about Splatoon-ing it?
[1:26:41] <featherlan> All ARMS characters are relatively close in size
[1:26:44] <premmylive> The characters are a bit too Different for that
[1:26:48] <powerprotoman> they really arnt
[1:26:53] <%tearfuldevil> not really
[1:26:54] <%DensityD> how soon can you charge again?
[1:26:58] <dapperskeleton69> yeh naw
[1:27:09] <powerprotoman> also their defualt arms are radically diffrent besides springman and tron who share defualt arms
[1:27:22] <%DensityD> IT'S LITERALLY VERY FLEXIBLE
[1:27:29] <%DensityD> OpieOP
[1:27:32] <premmylive> Honestly you could make the specials and smashes into alt arms
[1:27:35] <featherlan> So then the first two, they're basically the face of the game
[1:27:54] <premmylive> Yeah but they’re not quite Ken and Ryu stylistically
[1:27:57] <%DensityD> PogChamp flash kick
[1:27:59] <Thunderhog> Yeah, so minmin on backdash has a parry kick
[1:28:01] <%tearfuldevil> sping man, spring girl, twintelle, ninja man, minmin, i think you could have them all as the same character?
[1:28:07] <PleasantLeech> it's so boring to just do the face especially for this game
[1:28:07] <%tearfuldevil> splatoon style
[1:28:37] <featherlan> Yeah, but when it comes to the most recognizable character, that's when it gets tricky
[1:28:54] <%DensityD> wtf scorpion arms
[1:28:55] <%tearfuldevil> i wodner if people would have been more happy with 3 houses rep if it wasn't byleth?
[1:28:57] <%DensityD> wow this game
[1:29:08] <%tearfuldevil> like what if it was dimitri, edelgarde, or claude?
[1:29:14] <+IncredibleMeh> I'm so glad I found these tutorials, because yeah they are amazingly well put together
[1:29:18] <%CalebHatesGames> Doubtful, but maybe.
[1:29:19] <Dragon_Batman> I mean then you would get people who would be like but the house I wanted tho
[1:29:19] <%Irridium> it is boring but that's just what happens 99% of the time. That's why Killer Instinct going for The Arbiter rather than Master Chief was so hype
[1:29:21] <Run44forrest> twintelle Kreygasm
[1:29:32] <featherlan> Would the house lord be like Pokemon Trainer?
[1:29:42] <%tearfuldevil> no i meant like
[1:29:46] <%tearfuldevil> just picking one
[1:29:49] <featherlan> Oh
[1:29:52] <Dragon_Batman> Which it would have been Edelgard cuz she is super popular
[1:29:55] <%tearfuldevil> doing it as pokemon trianer sounds wierd
[1:30:09] <featherlan> Just one lord would have been worse
[1:30:13] <%tearfuldevil> i sitll haven
[1:30:18] <featherlan> Have you SEEN 3H fans?
[1:30:20] <premmylive> That’s actually cool
[1:30:23] <Dragon_Batman> I think the Poke trainer would have been fun
[1:30:27] <featherlan> They're like WOLVES
[1:30:30] <%DensityD> Mummy = fatty
[1:30:31] <Dragon_Batman> for the Lords I mean
[1:30:31] <premmylive> And would have been more representative of FE
[1:30:48] <featherlan> That's what I'm saying
[1:30:54] <premmylive> The same way Poketrainer is most like poke games
[1:30:56] <%tearfuldevil> i still haven't finished 3h, i've only done (part of) the blue lions route, and edelgarde is still my favourite lol
[1:31:08] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[1:31:08] <featherlan> It either had to be ALL three lords, or Byleth
[1:31:18] <premmylive> I mean
[1:31:22] <%tearfuldevil> yeha pokemon trainer is great
[1:31:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> man i love all the stuff i can do with characters that used to be unusable in dbfz
[1:31:32] <premmylive> Let’s coulda been hangin on the side like trainer
[1:31:38] <Dragon_Batman> I'm happy Byleth at least had alot of thought put into them
[1:31:47] <%Wool> bruh why is there so much
[1:31:48] <featherlan> ^^^
[1:31:52] <%tearfuldevil> incorporating the idea of switching pokemon depending on the situaiton is aces
[1:31:53] <PleasantLeech> I own this game and didn't know
[1:31:53] <chronoxgp> regrettably i will have played more gran blue versus than FE in about a week
[1:31:59] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:32:06] <Dragon_Batman> Fair
[1:32:07] <%Irridium> byleth's is actually fine but it's just not as exciting as literally every other fighter in the pass.
[1:32:07] <%Wool> when are we gonna learn about Korean backdashing
[1:32:10] <%jiggy_snipe> I think if Byleth was the 1st dlc character, no one would complain
[1:32:13] <+IncredibleMeh> yeyeye YABUKI
[1:32:18] <Solidnick18> how many videos are their?
[1:32:19] <featherlan> I'm ALMOST done with BL, but I've been distracted with drawing
[1:32:26] <Dragon_Batman> I think Byleth should have been middle
[1:32:29] <%SirGO0SE> oh shit someone gave me a gift sub! <3 gotta check who it was but thank you in advance <3
[1:32:30] <Saltmeisterr> oh right
[1:32:30] <%tearfuldevil> @chronoxgp i mean the fighting game, and not the gacha, is nothing to be ashamed of
[1:32:32] <premmylive> It’s so much because Arms is so good
[1:32:35] <%Irridium> byleth's final smash also looks hilariously bad too. Sothis dot jpeg
[1:32:37] <featherlan> Imagine ending on Joker
[1:32:41] <powerprotoman> yabuki was a monster
[1:32:42] <Saltmeisterr> this ded game
[1:32:42] <%Irridium> with mouthflaps
[1:32:46] <Dragon_Batman> Like keep Joker as first to bring excitement then half way bring them in
[1:32:47] <gamemastertom> you can also use he wind element into a rush, usually called a "wind Yabuki"
[1:32:53] <%tearfuldevil> yeah thats the one part of byleth that i actually dislike
[1:32:54] <featherlan> Byleth's FS is indeed very bad
[1:32:56] <Dragon_Batman> and end it with Terry or something
[1:32:57] <PleasantLeech> yeah you have to save the best for last
[1:32:59] <%tearfuldevil> the final smash is sooooo bad
[1:33:03] <chronoxgp> i jus don't understand why fire emblem wasn't on the Wii U
[1:33:10] <featherlan> It was tho
[1:33:16] <featherlan> Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[1:33:17] <+R_BChe> cause 3ds was still alive
[1:33:18] <featherlan> XD
[1:33:18] <Jathspuh> the woolie character
[1:33:23] <%Irridium> Every other final smash for the fighter pass characters look so great and detailed and sothis is just... woof
[1:33:23] <Solidnick18> I see
[1:33:34] <Dragon_Batman> Too much time in development to make it to Wii U?
[1:33:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:34] <Jathspuh> Star Platinum: Mayan Edition
[1:33:42] <bleugh> does anyone still play this game
[1:33:46] <+IncredibleMeh> That S shaped stage is corner pressure central
[1:33:46] <Saltmeisterr> no
[1:34:12] <featherlan> I'm still praying to the Nintendo gods that No More Heroes gets SOMETHING in Smash
[1:34:19] <Dragon_Batman> Yea I also think Byleth's super had a what the hell do we do kinda thing too
[1:34:21] <+R_BChe> a spirit :)
[1:34:22] <Saltmeisterr> and I don't blame people for dropping this
[1:34:24] <chronoxgp> i stopped playing when i realized the single player was too hard for joy cons
[1:34:30] <Saltmeisterr> theres not much there to chew
[1:34:40] <featherlan> They coulda had the Lords in the FS
[1:34:50] <+IncredibleMeh> If you hold the thumbstick down while pick your arms you can select without it showing on the menu
[1:34:51] <MattoBii> Your's
[1:35:01] <%DensityD> RUSH
[1:35:01] <bleugh> your's
[1:35:02] <%jiggy_snipe> if anyone cares, Black Desert Online (that game with the really detailed character creation) is free on Steam to March 2
[1:35:05] <featherlan> As that synergy thing 3H has
[1:35:06] <%Irridium> your's
[1:35:07] <premmylive> “Not much there to chew” : Said an hour into tutorials
[1:35:12] <Solidnick18> on rush huh
[1:35:13] <Dragon_Batman> That would be neat but that would probably take more time than they would have wanted
[1:35:16] <%tearfuldevil> @featherlan is NMH not even like, a spirit? huh
[1:35:24] <featherlan> Not yet, sadly
[1:35:25] <CyrusVGZ> Free forever?
[1:35:28] <%DensityD> EXHEAVY
[1:35:34] <premmylive> But there definitely sees more “content” in arms 2
[1:35:39] <premmylive> Needs
[1:35:40] <%jiggy_snipe> i believe so
[1:35:40] <chronoxgp> i dunno i was surpised Snake was even a character MGS2 was pretty violen
[1:35:54] <featherlan> BAYONETTA is in the game
[1:35:56] <%tearfuldevil> @jiggy_snipe i got it today, installed it, realized that classes are gender/race locked, and uninstalled
[1:35:59] <+chiluzza> when we getting ARMS in EVO
[1:36:03] <featherlan> Travis can get in for sure
[1:36:14] <%jiggy_snipe> well then, that sucks
[1:36:19] <MattoBii> ARMS got into the first EVO Japan, but nothing since
[1:36:20] <%Irridium> Agent Francis York Morgan for Smash
[1:36:22] <Dragon_Batman> Even then they toned Bayo a little
[1:36:29] <%tearfuldevil> yeah the character creatoor in BDO is super detailed
[1:36:32] <Saltmeisterr> i would like to see more moves aside from punch/block/grab/dash
[1:36:33] <featherlan> Just tone down Travis
[1:36:43] <%tearfuldevil> but its also surprisingly limited
[1:36:48] <%tearfuldevil> who knew
[1:36:55] <premmylive> I want standing jukes/dodges
[1:37:06] <CyrusVGZ> They could put out the character creator standalone and I would play with it for hours.
[1:37:09] <chronoxgp> travis' special throws his sticky wet rags at you from his garbage horrifying the other player
[1:37:16] <%jiggy_snipe> I kinda wanna make a character but not play lol
[1:37:24] <%DensityD> heavy all day erry day
[1:37:26] <Dragon_Batman> Francis York Morgan would be too strong
[1:37:26] <%tearfuldevil> yeah thats all i wanted to do
[1:37:29] <%DensityD> WAIT NO
[1:37:30] <%tearfuldevil> so i got my moneys worth
[1:37:34] <dapperskeleton69> oh, BIG
[1:37:36] <%tearfuldevil> even though i payed nothing lol
[1:37:36] <featherlan> I've been wondering on what Travis could have as a moveset
[1:37:40] <%DensityD> sweet spots?
[1:37:42] <+heroicbrawlerKK> love this game. hope they get a sequel one day.
[1:37:44] <PleasantLeech> someday we'll just have the doll maker video game we all want
[1:37:57] <@Solidus_113> Range or damage scaling
[1:38:03] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan i imagine he might work similarly to shulk
[1:38:16] <%tearfuldevil> imagine a DMC or Bayo game, with char creation
[1:38:18] <%SirGO0SE> i feel like maybe it will get a huge dlc at some point but a second game on the switch would be a surprise
[1:38:22] <%tearfuldevil> i would be soooo in
[1:38:24] <dapperskeleton69> with a beam recharge mechanic
[1:38:28] <CyrusVGZ> Bro, I want a standalone character creator so badly. I have art things I wanna do but I can't draw and I can't 3D model.
[1:38:28] <featherlan> Like Shulk but with Marth/Lucina sice B?
[1:38:42] <%SirGO0SE> well another huge dlc
[1:38:43] <%JustYudha> This game is a lot more in depth than I thought...Jesus
[1:38:43] <dapperskeleton69> maybe
[1:38:45] <featherlan> That CHANGES depending on beam katana
[1:39:01] <%jiggy_snipe> ikr, after I saw that creator, I wanted every game to have something like it
[1:39:09] <premmylive> I really want Nintendo to kinda stagger their good Competitive game releases
[1:39:10] <Dragon_Batman> Down B for different KAtanas?
[1:39:11] <%DensityD> combo is safest
[1:39:12] <dapperskeleton69> what if travis became the style switch character
[1:39:16] <%SirGO0SE> spring man as a dhalsim would have been so good for smash t_t its hard not to think about
[1:39:29] <%tearfuldevil> i mean dhalsim in smash is wierd
[1:39:31] <featherlan> I would be OKAY with that
[1:39:31] <dapperskeleton69> different katanas for different movesets/bonuses
[1:39:38] <featherlan> TOTALLY FINE
[1:39:41] <%tearfuldevil> i'm not into smash at all, so correct me if i'm wrong
[1:39:44] <waffleandman> the game that was forgotten
[1:39:46] <%DensityD> this is the one?
[1:39:46] <%tearfuldevil> but is that not already a thing?
[1:39:47] <Dragon_Batman> Taht would make him unique enough in smash
[1:39:55] <dapperskeleton69> plus it has a charge mwchanic similar to inkling where you gotta block and mash up/down to recharge
[1:40:00] <premmylive> So like Splat3, wait, arms 2 wait, Something else
[1:40:05] <%SirGO0SE> theres a lot of sword dominance in smash and a dhalsim to out poke them would have been great
[1:40:05] <%tearfuldevil> like, there's characters that are ranged keepaway with teleports
[1:40:16] <%DensityD> PogChamp SUPER ARMOR
[1:40:18] <Thunderhog> Rush is also a parry
[1:40:20] <%Ninestempest> PogChamp
[1:40:21] <featherlan> Travis can't be shown jacking it thoug, Smash is for good boys and girls
[1:40:22] <+chiluzza> COUNTER
[1:40:31] <Dragon_Batman> Shadow Counter!
[1:40:39] <dapperskeleton69> hes not jacking it hes cjarging his beam sword Kappa
[1:40:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[1:40:41] <rustedfish> phone died, what happun
[1:40:44] <%tearfuldevil> @featherlan its sticky cause he spilled orange juice on it
[1:40:46] <PleasantLeech> it's a devil trigger
[1:40:53] <chronoxgp> Travis had to wave his beam saber in NMH2 because parents complained
[1:40:59] <Applecannon63> I could see Travis just shake like a soda can
[1:41:02] <featherlan> Guys, we all know damn well what Travis is doing
[1:41:03] <Thunderhog> Basicly you either wanna combo rush, or save it as a punish
[1:41:10] <dapperskeleton69> YEAH BUT THE KIDS DONT
[1:41:11] <Dragon_Batman> At least Travis would have his throws
[1:41:29] <chronoxgp> there are flashlights that really charge like that tho
[1:41:33] <featherlan> How to implement his throws....
[1:41:38] <Applecannon63> Just travis do a handy motion than a jacking off
[1:41:38] <%DensityD> woolieGLORY
[1:41:39] <%tearfuldevil> what parents are buying their kids NMH
[1:41:42] <%tearfuldevil> and then complaining
[1:41:45] <dapperskeleton69> his throws are just throws
[1:41:49] <%tearfuldevil> about it being too dirty
[1:41:53] <dapperskeleton69> back throw is suplex
[1:41:58] <+cowkid222> guys just think of the Santa Destroy stage though. And the music! (assuming a smash conversation is happening here, I got here late)
[1:41:59] <wegood456> MUDAMUDAMUDA
[1:42:03] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the throws are just in by default
[1:42:03] <featherlan> His throws are the only throws that don't throw
[1:42:04] <dapperskeleton69> down throw is dropping on their head
[1:42:05] <@Solidus_113> what is this term
[1:42:08] <featherlan> Instead, they have stun
[1:42:11] <cascadepersona> I heard there would be arms and came immediately.
[1:42:12] <%DensityD> option select
[1:42:18] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGLORY
[1:42:22] <guymontag0> Think this game should’ve played like Power Stone
[1:42:23] <%Wool> GRAB-BREAK REFRESH
[1:42:23] <wegood456> You ready to play?
[1:42:31] <guymontag0> Love the characters and designs
[1:42:41] <PleasantLeech> there was way more tech than I was expecting
[1:42:43] <%Wool> bruh how videos are there
[1:42:43] <dapperskeleton69> okay but heres the thing
[1:42:47] <%Wool> how many*
[1:42:47] <%DensityD> many
[1:42:47] <crimsonsaens> Always good to only watch one or two guides per play session
[1:42:56] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[1:42:57] <Saltmeisterr> i love the designs in the game
[1:42:59] <Applecannon63> Travis Final Smash should just be his spirit animal the sex tiger
[1:42:59] <dapperskeleton69> how we gonna implement the style system for dante in smash
[1:43:00] <Dragon_Batman> Wow that is alot more than I thought
[1:43:02] <%tearfuldevil> ngl, i don't even own (or plan to buy, cause nintendo games never go on sale) ARMS, and i wanna watch these tutorials
[1:43:02] <PleasantLeech> fug
[1:43:04] <GeltonZ> Oh snap! Chat how long has Woolie been ARMSing? Has he played yet?
[1:43:12] <%Wool> the 13 minute video might be the most important tech
[1:43:16] <%DensityD> visit ARMS Study Lab Tips and Tourneys on youtube
[1:43:26] <chronoxgp> dude just play all you need to know is pro controller > joy con
[1:43:28] <dapperskeleton69> would style have a part to play, or would style be an arbitrary thing
[1:43:30] <%DensityD> !uptime
[1:43:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 2 minutes
[1:43:31] <Dragon_Batman> @dapperskeleton69 You have to taunt to raise a level and get more for your moves
[1:43:35] <+cowkid222> Dante style switch can be his taunts. 4 taunts and he does the snaps
[1:43:38] <%Irridium> hope there's a video that just says "SHIN ARMS {REQUIEM}
[1:43:40] <%tearfuldevil> @GeltonZ they only actually played a little bit, they've mostly been wathcing these surprisingly weell made fan tutorials
[1:43:45] <%DensityD> @GeltonZ they did some warm up matches
[1:43:52] <dapperskeleton69> okay but you cant taunt in online
[1:44:01] <%DensityD> hall wugging
[1:44:11] <Dragon_Batman> Dante can now Kappa, honestly didn't know that
[1:44:13] <+cowkid222> exception made for Dante
[1:44:13] <%tearfuldevil> @Irridium ARMS 2: ARMS of the DEVIL
[1:44:16] <GeltonZ> @tearknack @DensityD Alright thanks. Sounds like I should look for my copy and ready up then!
[1:44:21] <Dragon_Batman> So Shulk nuetral B
[1:44:21] <dapperskeleton69> so im thinking style would just be an arbitrary mechanic with no effect on the match
[1:44:28] <%DensityD> WHEN'S ONLINE?
[1:44:31] <dapperskeleton69> but dante's winscreen gives a ranking
[1:44:36] <%Irridium> ARMS Beyond: LEGS
[1:44:38] <Saltmeisterr> Arms Double Upper
[1:44:44] <+dmtjinni> Lets watch!
[1:44:55] <Applecannon63> Doomslayer's gimmick is glory kills in a form of Little Mac's power meter and super armor
[1:44:57] <featherlan> GLASS SHATTER for his win screen
[1:44:59] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he would be the only character with a baked in style rank
[1:45:05] <+cowkid222> if you win with a D ranking, did you really win?
[1:45:09] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus brain is FED
[1:45:11] <dapperskeleton69> like when the match is over and dante wins, the glass shatters and you get your style grading
[1:45:12] <%DensityD> FEED
[1:45:16] <waffleandman> SourPLs
[1:45:18] <Mvrdok_> Arms to study, lab, tourney and chill
[1:45:20] <VJdarkworld> hashtag doom slayer and dante for ARMS 2
[1:45:22] <Applecannon63> Woolies brain is dummy filled
[1:45:23] <featherlan> WAIT
[1:45:23] <Dragon_Batman> Just rematch and self detruct if you get a D
[1:45:27] <featherlan> BEFORE I FORGET
[1:45:35] <featherlan> What would Travis have as a FS???
[1:45:41] <MattoBii> oh god, snake park
[1:45:45] <Saltmeisterr> FS is tiger
[1:45:46] <dapperskeleton69> ANARCHY IN THE GALAXY
[1:45:49] <+Metaternal> Snake Park LUL
[1:45:50] <+AstroNinja0> Oh no...poor mummy. This is like his worst MU
[1:45:52] <Applecannon63> The tiger or the glastonberru
[1:45:56] <Thunderhog> Oh hey, the banned stage
[1:45:56] <Dragon_Batman> His bike would come in maybe
[1:46:00] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus also, colour changes are hold down L3, and then tilt directions
[1:46:00] <+cowkid222> or the giant robot he used literally once
[1:46:01] <%Irridium> wonder red really should be in smash but he never will feelsbadman
[1:46:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> there really needs to be a penalty in dbfz for jumping back jump jump, like fuck.
[1:46:09] <MattoBii> bird p
[1:46:11] <dapperskeleton69> okay no i will fight you
[1:46:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> put in the ggcrd penalty of being to much of a coward
[1:46:20] <%DensityD> he's already on a beyblade
[1:46:22] <dapperskeleton69> we NEED anarchy in the galaxy as travis' FS
[1:46:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> *ggxrd
[1:46:30] <%DensityD> mummy has battle top advantage
[1:46:31] <+RealPT1> Best Song, Worst Stage
[1:46:32] <Dragon_Batman> Losing meter would do it
[1:46:33] <Saltmeisterr> if the boards where removed would this be legal?
[1:46:40] <Dragon_Batman> I agree
[1:46:42] <+cowkid222> which one is anarchy again? the giant explosion?
[1:46:45] <%DensityD> GET ON A TOP
[1:46:47] <Thunderhog> This stage is very vanilla without the tops
[1:46:48] <%tearfuldevil> have they not even noticed the beyblade
[1:46:52] <Solidnick18> Bird up
[1:46:55] <@Solidus_113> Reggie has Beyblade advantage
[1:46:56] <dapperskeleton69> yeah, the giant explosion with the hype effects
[1:46:57] <Thunderhog> but with em, this stage is literally the worst stage in game
[1:46:57] <+IncredibleMeh> You gotta HOLD the dodge button
[1:46:59] <+dmtjinni> This for Fun or Glory Episode?
[1:47:04] <Thunderhog> Just a fight to get on a beyblade
[1:47:07] <%DensityD> TOO EARLY
[1:47:08] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[1:47:09] <@Solidus_113> woolieGLORY
[1:47:20] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[1:47:21] <+goufuem> @Saltmeisterr It'd still be too big of a stage.
[1:47:30] <dapperskeleton69> this is for glory
[1:47:38] <dapperskeleton69> aka, SUMBODY GETTIN FUUUUUCKED
[1:47:48] <Dragon_Batman> The guest couldn't make it
[1:47:48] <+cowkid222> what if the FS rolls the roulette and he gets anarchy, or strawberry, or the tiger. just thinking, just thinking
[1:47:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:55] <Dragon_Batman> But left some docs
[1:48:03] <Saltmeisterr> there was a guest?
[1:48:04] <dapperskeleton69> that would actually be pretty cool cowkid
[1:48:05] <+dmtjinni> Comments gona be mad slaty LUL
[1:48:16] <featherlan> YO. NO MORE HEROES MUSIC IN SMASH
[1:48:21] <dapperskeleton69> but would they have different effects or be the same effect with different grapgics
[1:48:26] <featherlan> A SOUNDTRACK TO RIVAL P5
[1:48:30] <dapperskeleton69> YO
[1:48:34] <+dmtjinni> Wat
[1:48:40] <featherlan> PHILISTINE INSTRUMENTAL
[1:48:48] <+cowkid222> that's all I've ever wanted! just the theme, holy shit man, it'd be amazing
[1:48:51] <dapperskeleton69> KILL OR BE KILLED REMIX
[1:48:52] <%Irridium> when's Gene from God Hand for smash. Final Smash is the Roulette Wheel. Dragon kick their ass into the milky way
[1:48:55] <Applecannon63> Not just only No more heroes music in smash but Killer7 music included
[1:48:56] <MattoBii> there's a reason this stage eventually got banned in ranked online LUL
[1:48:57] <chronoxgp> reaper, reaper
[1:49:02] <chronoxgp> tell me somehting
[1:49:09] <%DensityD> what kind of people are standing in this crowd?
[1:49:12] <Saltmeisterr> Orca Force tho
[1:49:13] <Dragon_Batman> Would love to hear a remix of some songs if that happened
[1:49:14] <TheDrown> "This is where it gets real" Gets the only stage banned from ranked LUL
[1:49:14] <dapperskeleton69> ORCA FORCE
[1:49:19] <+cowkid222> oh god the skng from killer7. you all know the song.
[1:49:26] <Applecannon63> YOU'RE GODDAMN PHILISTINE
[1:49:28] <%Ninestempest> that parry timing looks VERY tight
[1:49:31] <featherlan> Or the Mid-boss theme from Travis Strikes Again
[1:49:34] <%Ninestempest> gonna take some practice
[1:49:35] <problemagic> im buckshot
[1:49:36] <jubejube56> I feel like adding a god hand character to smash would almost be an insult to every other Nintendo character that didn't make it in
[1:49:38] <%DensityD> good disable
[1:49:42] <dapperskeleton69> real talk philistine would only be instrumental in smash
[1:49:55] <Solidnick18> orca force is great
[1:49:55] <featherlan> Duh
[1:49:55] <dapperskeleton69> they would NOT put those lyrics in
[1:49:56] <featherlan> XD
[1:50:02] <problemagic> use the gun!
[1:50:06] <Solidnick18> what the hell is going on?
[1:50:10] <featherlan> That's why I said Inst!
[1:50:14] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus So for the record, this stage is normally banned. Even online this stage never shows up on random matches. the tops give too much momentum to whoever lands a knockdown
[1:50:16] <dapperskeleton69> yo get "stop hanging DJs" in smash
[1:50:16] <%Irridium> I mean that's fine. Snake Eater's only instrumental and that's still good
[1:50:25] <chronoxgp> How about Hatsune Miku for smash? She could attack with celery
[1:50:25] <problemagic> dragon install
[1:50:25] <%DensityD> Dr Coyle seems bad with double heavy
[1:50:25] <MattoBii> @WoolieVersus this stage actually got banned in ranked
[1:50:32] <Dragon_Batman> Two different Snake Eaters too
[1:50:39] <+dmtjinni> we livin!
[1:50:40] <dapperskeleton69> WE ARE FINALLY COWBOYS
[1:50:41] <featherlan> Philistine, We Are Finally Cowboys, N.M.H., It's Kill or Be Killed, what else...?
[1:50:48] <VJdarkworld> hashtag platform from ARMS for smash
[1:50:49] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus colour change is a thing
[1:50:50] <PleasantLeech> double heavy in general is pretty risky
[1:50:57] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus hold down l3, tilt directions
[1:50:58] <dapperskeleton69> We are finally cowboys remix?
[1:50:59] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus L3 and hold a direction
[1:50:59] <featherlan> Gotta get something from TSA
[1:51:00] <%Wool> L3 and move in a direction
[1:51:00] <%Irridium> L3, a direction, and confirm
[1:51:01] <MattoBii> L3 while holding a direction
[1:51:05] <%DensityD> MANGO SENTINEL
[1:51:10] <PleasantLeech> l3 and hold a direction
[1:51:19] <Applecannon63> its kill or be killed would be altered
[1:51:26] <%Wool> MIGHT AND BYTE AND WHITE
[1:51:28] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan stop hanging DJs aka destroyman's theme
[1:51:30] <Dragon_Batman> Some of the alts are kool, I remember
[1:51:32] <Thunderhog> and its a SECRET
[1:51:34] <Thunderhog> SERIOUSLY WHY
[1:51:42] <%Irridium> because Nintendo
[1:51:44] <MutedMimic> LUL
[1:51:45] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:51:45] <problemagic> wait is the cute one Woolie?
[1:51:45] <jubejube56> Might and Byte was just Astral Chain all along
[1:51:47] <featherlan> Electric Thunder Tiger II - Electro Triple Star's boss theme
[1:51:49] <Dragon_Batman> Makes no sense, the game doesn't even tell you right?
[1:52:00] <%tearfuldevil> @problemagic no, reggie is cuter
[1:52:05] <%Wool> the game tells you there are colors, but not how to get them
[1:52:09] <%DensityD> reggie, jump and dash
[1:52:12] <Dragon_Batman> Wild
[1:52:13] <MattoBii> the dog is also a trampoline
[1:52:13] <%DensityD> be mobile
[1:52:13] <NeroInfinite> Look at all those GOO MEN
[1:52:16] <%tearfuldevil> @problemagic (woolie is the gilr in the robot)
[1:52:20] <Saltmeisterr> toob men
[1:52:23] <%Wool> You Cannot Pet the Dog in ARMS
[1:52:30] <+RealPT1> Reggie to focused
[1:52:33] <dapperskeleton69> we would probably also get a remix of the minigame music in travis' stage @featherlan
[1:52:33] <Applecannon63> so do is straight up Leroy's little Sugar?
[1:52:33] <featherlan> You can pet him
[1:52:35] <%DensityD> FINAL DESTINATION ONLY
[1:52:39] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:52:40] <featherlan> With your FIST
[1:52:40] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus For reggie, when you block the dog gets summoned in front of you, and you can jump off the dog for air gimmicks
[1:52:44] <PleasantLeech> you can punch them tho
[1:52:44] <MutedMimic> Bonk him 😠
[1:52:45] <+RealPT1> he's always getting clipped on his side
[1:52:48] <Saltmeisterr> i wish this game would go on sale
[1:53:06] <%SirGO0SE> psaJpeg

[1:56:13] <Saltmeisterr> i feel like it got released at a bad time
[1:56:22] <PleasantLeech> @thunderhog it took off pretty well for a new ip that's a fighting game
[1:56:23] <featherlan> It's JUST as popping as the other NMH titles
[1:56:26] <@Solidus_113> all this meter

[2:04:02] <Zayasu> wonder why this game is dead atpCap
[2:04:07] <%DensityD> 6 arms
[2:04:07] <+IncredibleMeh> Oh shit yeah boss time
[2:04:10] <problemagic> haha reggie got eliminated in pools but automatically
[2:04:10] <featherlan> We already have It's Kill Or Be Killed as the 70s funky track
[2:04:14] <Dragon_Batman> A character with the boss on their head
[2:04:18] <PleasantLeech> free 4 all?
[2:04:20] <crimsonsaens> They had to nerf Woolie by removing REggie
[2:04:21] <+dmtjinni> wat ok the game is cool
[2:04:28] <MattoBii> you got hit with a stun bomb
[2:04:38] <%Irridium> @Wool LUL
[2:04:43] <%Wool> I DON'T WANT YOU
[2:04:46] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan what about Shinobu's theme
[2:04:49] <%SirGO0SE> keep up the RHYTHM
[2:04:52] <%DensityD> nice nice nice
[2:05:06] <featherlan> Samurai Summer would be good
[2:05:08] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus Try to join a room that's empty
[2:05:12] <+OUTheTeam> only lvl 3 though, that dude is crazy stupid at lvl7
[2:05:16] <@Solidus_113> back out and enter new parties to refresh the room
[2:05:20] <GeltonZ> XD Me, Wool, and Irridium keep finding eachother.
[2:05:20] <MattoBii> some modes are player 1 only
[2:05:22] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan theyd probably remix samurai summer
[2:05:36] <+cowkid222> @woolieversus it randomly picks a game type, sometimes the second person is included. sometimes not.
[2:05:42] <problemagic> couch feaux-op
[2:05:44] <featherlan> Just up the tempo?
[2:05:49] <featherlan> Wait, all this talk, but none on the STAGE?
[2:05:49] <PleasantLeech> this works well for how fast the matches are
[2:06:02] <MattoBii> if I was home right now, I'd try jumping in to see
[2:06:12] <dapperskeleton69> stage would have to be santa destroy
[2:06:20] <featherlan> The hotel?
[2:06:27] <dapperskeleton69> maybe a travelling stage
[2:06:37] <%Wool> @Irridium @GeltonZ maybe if we just stay together Woolie will join
[2:06:43] <@Solidus_113> WOMBO COMBO
[2:06:52] <%Irridium> Yeah with our powers combined
[2:06:54] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan make travis' stage the mall parking lot from 2 Kappa

[2:07:09] <%Ninestempest> ban wobbling >:C
[2:07:09] <problemagic> you won a badge
[2:07:12] <featherlan> would be good
[2:07:12] <%DensityD> sure reggie, build up as much hubris as possible
[2:07:15] <BearyBarrington> This are probably children fighting you
[2:07:22] <%DensityD> for Honor
[2:07:27] <+rooked4> Abacchio putting the drink down
[2:07:32] <problemagic> did he say teams or teens?
[2:07:35] <featherlan> With the big moon
[2:07:43] <crimsonsaens> Are we doing Smash doubles next time?
[2:07:48] <PleasantLeech> don't diss kids, they're actually good at games believe it or not
[2:07:55] <+dmtjinni> yoga gurl

[2:08:24] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Me, Irridium, and Wool are all in a room together.
[2:08:25] <$SilverRoddo> “Don’t try it!”
[2:08:32] <featherlan> Wait, how about the stage change, an area from each main title, but the transition is a la Death Dreive Mk. 2?
[2:08:35] <guymontag0> Twintelle lytCANDY
[2:08:35] <%SirGO0SE> thats a lot of ass
[2:08:38] <dapperskeleton69> @silverroddo I HATE YOU

[2:10:28] <@Moobot> 682 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:10:28] <featherlan> No idea what locales will be in three, but for the other two, it def would have to be the NMH hotel for 1, and maybe Skelter Helter or Margaret's arena
[2:10:30] <dapperskeleton69> everyone is watching woolie's side Kappa
[2:10:37] <TheDrown> I found Wool's room

[2:11:12] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie you're on the ass character Kreygasm
[2:11:13] <problemagic> omg
[2:11:13] <%tearfuldevil> hot take - if a nmh character gets into smash, i hope its the GODDAMN SUPERHERO from 3
[2:11:15] <+cvp5127> shots fired
[2:11:20] <%TubeMan642> Clown
[2:11:20] <+rooked4> Stop feeding top
[2:11:24] <+IncredibleMeh> @WoolieVersus I can assure you Misango is far from amazing
[2:11:32] <%RyTYoung> the FEED is real
[2:11:33] <$SilverRoddo> “Wanted” those punches, so you can attack enemies from behind cover
[2:11:34] <Solidnick18> pick clown against woolie
[2:11:41] <Thunderhog> And i think woolies room is filled
[2:11:42] <%Superbro64> TOP IS FED
[2:11:43] <+cvp5127> pick a top tier
[2:11:43] <+NotHereToStream> pick top tier
[2:11:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> pick the clown since that's what you're playing tonight
[2:11:46] <Dragon_Batman> LUL pick a top tier Kappa
[2:11:52] <featherlan> But Smash needs a WEEB as a rep; it fits TOO well
[2:12:00] <TheDrown> @Wool GG
[2:12:18] <problemagic> I SUPER want Platinum's GG to be what nmh3 lied about being
[2:12:20] <$SilverRoddo> Don’t think, FEEL
[2:12:27] <crimsonsaens> Reggie just punched Woolie in the back
[2:12:42] <problemagic> he has it coming tho
[2:12:50] <dapperskeleton69> smash needs a sword character that isnt link or fire emblem
[2:12:54] <Dragon_Batman> Reggie still holds grudes
[2:12:59] <Dragon_Batman> grudges*
[2:13:00] <problemagic> p
[2:13:14] <problemagic> salt party but it's the entire channel
[2:13:15] <GarbageNirvana> @dapperskeleton69 Or Xenoblade or Dragon Quest or
[2:13:26] <%tearfuldevil> @dapperskeleton69 hero exists
[2:13:28] <Dragon_Batman> Tales of character or Monhun?
[2:13:29] <%DensityD> timer scam
[2:13:30] <premmylive> Motion’s all I got, woolie
[2:13:46] <PleasantLeech> the hubris!
[2:13:55] <problemagic> im buckshot
[2:14:03] <+IncredibleMeh> Dang stream sniping is hard
[2:14:04] <dapperskeleton69> xeno and DQ are good but DQ is still range spammy and shulk is fine, but his moves are weird
[2:14:07] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:14:12] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus It auto picks rotates when you go online with 2 people
[2:14:16] <%Wool> stream sniping is very hard
[2:14:38] <%SirGO0SE> on the bright side its good to know there is a healthy amount of people playing
[2:14:41] <Thunderhog> Also you might wanna move into a new room cause you're gonna be stuck with the same people if you stay in a single room
[2:14:50] <Dragon_Batman> Shulk having the Menado arts really brings that character out
[2:14:53] <%tearfuldevil> isn't this character supposed to be able to grow a third arm somehow?
[2:14:59] <fuji_92> big wipouts in this match
[2:15:11] <@Solidus_113> Or make a countdown for when you're going to enter party mode
[2:15:12] <GeltonZ> I managed to get into the lobby you WERE in after you left
[2:15:14] <problemagic> I grew a third arm once and it bankrupted my entire family
[2:15:19] <problemagic> bernie pls
[2:15:28] <%DensityD> WutFace
[2:15:31] <$SilverRoddo> Why not wind-mill punch all the time? Seems like a no-brainer.
[2:15:35] <%SirGO0SE> HEYYY
[2:15:40] <Dragon_Batman> Popstar I think
[2:15:46] <PleasantLeech> jumping in and out probably makes it less likely to match up
[2:15:51] <+rooked4> Max Steel
[2:15:56] <dapperskeleton69> im gonna move forward and swing my ARMS, and if you get hit its your own fault
[2:15:59] <marvel877> Ribbon Girl's a pop idol, yeah.

[3:25:26] <%Superbro64> I will say, the concept of angel/devil wings and halos ruined the idea of character design itself
[3:25:26] <%tearfuldevil> her face is wierd, but it did look more human at a better angle
[3:25:28] <%SirGO0SE> i think the point of originelle is that she is not original yeah lol
[3:25:30] <Hellarussian> its the weird 90's anime face
[3:25:37] <%tearfuldevil> originelle remind sme of
[3:25:38] <%tearfuldevil> um
[3:25:42] <%tearfuldevil> that oen yugioh card
[3:25:45] <%yeknomlive> like the how to draw anime books
[3:25:49] <Hellarussian> Change of Heart?
[3:25:50] <%StaceMcGate> if she has a move that teleports behind an opponent she is full deviant art
[3:25:57] <%tearfuldevil> yeah, Change of Heart
[3:26:05] <%DensityD> SHOULD HE HYPE MOVE IN LIGHT FORM OR IN DARK FORM!?!!
[3:26:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> dashcon forever the scam of tumblr
[3:26:11] <MayorRev> T H E R E
[3:26:19] <%Superbro64> how to draw anime books must made bank back in the day
[3:26:22] <%SirGO0SE> the stages in this are sick
[3:26:36] <Dragon_Batman> I feel like Dark form hype move would be more edgy
[3:26:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[3:26:39] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if you can kick someone through the window
[3:26:44] <%SirGO0SE> GEESEU
[3:26:45] <%tearfuldevil> her character design actually looks pretty neat in dark form, ngl
[3:26:57] <%DensityD> aw, stingray blew the hype meter
[3:26:58] <%Superbro64> buy low sell high on those hckbne stocks guys
[3:27:14] <@Solidus_113> body explosion?
[3:27:14] <%tearfuldevil> the simple colours make it seem way less overdesigned
[3:27:22] <%tearfuldevil> and there's no wierd thick halo
[3:27:25] <+HarleySilverWolf> so what's the lore?
[3:27:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Morrigan?
[3:27:36] <Dragon_Batman> Was just gonna say
[3:27:40] <+bootysteve> This is giving me a headache to watch
[3:27:43] <%DensityD> REGGIE'S STILLIN X FACTOR
[3:27:48] <%tearfuldevil> the halo looks less like a halo and more like some kind of snakc
[3:27:57] <Hellarussian> Woolie tried to lame it out
[3:27:58] <%tearfuldevil> like the Humpty Dumpty ring things
[3:27:59] <%Superbro64> high five LUL
[3:28:03] <MayorRev> robbed
[3:28:08] <+DukeBlack_> that's literally change of heart from Yugioh
[3:28:18] <heartlesshealer> odd number of characters
[3:28:26] <%tearfuldevil> tbf "half angel, half devil" is not an original idea
[3:28:40] <+HarleySilverWolf> Don't say heck! limesHeck
[3:28:42] <%tearfuldevil> yugioh is probably not the first to have come up with it
[3:28:43] <%SirGO0SE> early access, its getting cool guest characters too @heartlesshealer
[3:28:44] <%StaceMcGate> her name is originelle, I'm sure its a joke
[3:28:51] <@Solidus_113> Elevator fight!
[3:29:07] <TigerClaws12> heck
[3:29:07] <%SirGO0SE> woosh @StaceMcGate
[3:29:08] <%tearfuldevil> also yeah, the character is supposed to be donut steel
[3:29:14] <Hellarussian> if only this game had a hedgehog that could teleport behind you
[3:29:19] <%StaceMcGate> was that antfish?
[3:29:20] <heartlesshealer> @SirGO0SE Cool! Though I was more referring to how they tried everyone but Heckbane in an actual fight so far
[3:29:32] <%Superbro64> is that a t hawk special move?
[3:29:35] <$SirGO0SE> ah got ya
[3:29:38] <%Superbro64> with gen's idle stance>
[3:29:39] <%DensityD> in this game it's not called an install, it's "Swole"
[3:29:47] <Dragon_Batman> This is a fun track
[3:30:02] <Dragon_Batman> That is a great taunt
[3:30:41] <%Superbro64> it's kinda a funny
[3:31:00] <MayorRev> GET SOME
[3:31:00] <@Solidus_113> Heckbane's voice sounds really familiar, but I can't place it
[3:31:01] <+HarleySilverWolf> heckbane feels like a big WTA refrence
[3:31:07] <@Solidus_113> there's no VA credits on the site either
[3:31:08] <%Superbro64> much like those "inpsired by windjammers" games, these titles live and die by capcom not releasing powerstone on modern platforms
[3:31:11] <%StaceMcGate> I'm 90% Heckbane is Antfish
[3:31:20] <%StaceMcGate> trying to imdb it
[3:31:26] <Dragon_Batman> Shame there is no voice credits
[3:31:35] <MayorRev> haha! one!
[3:31:36] <%Superbro64> I wonder what happened to combat core

[4:15:41] <arkv01> everyone snorts from the pack
[4:15:48] <%SirGO0SE> ive played mtg for 20 years lol
[4:16:06] <%SirGO0SE> i wish i was addicted to heroin itd be cheaper
[4:16:19] <%BinaryFireball> shit's like a complicated fighting game
[4:16:29] <+cvp5127> as she should
[4:16:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:16:38] <%BinaryFireball> like death poker
[4:16:42] <Dragon_Batman> My friends play from time MTG from time to time, I used to take care of tourneys when I worked at a comic sho
[4:16:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I've tried Magic and have played a little bit of Yugioh with friends, but ultimately not a genre I'm super into
[4:16:47] <Dragon_Batman> shop*
[4:16:56] <Dragon_Batman> Never pulled me in tho
[4:16:59] <+arcielardor> Wait, you're comparing heroin to fighting games @Binary_Fireball ?
[4:17:03] <chronoxgp> fighting trying not to show kamiya my e heross collection
[4:17:06] <%SirGO0SE> its one of the best games ever created. you can literally build a computer out of MTG card mechanics. its thourough
[4:17:14] <%SirGO0SE> thorough
[4:17:16] <%BinaryFireball> I am comparing everything to heroin @arcielardor
[4:17:23] <Dragon_Batman> Pay to get in
[4:17:35] <%SirGO0SE> $300 buy in that becomes out dated in 6 months
[4:17:40] <%SirGO0SE> yeah
[4:17:52] <Dragon_Batman> Swtiching up sets every so often
[4:18:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's why YGOPro is the only way to play that game B)
[4:18:17] <+eanscrale> TCGs were the gacha of their time
[4:18:19] <%BinaryFireball> Ascension is a dope deck building game
[4:18:21] <+OUTheTeam> yugioh doesn't rotate cards out so you can use everything since the start that isnt banned
[4:18:23] <Clausible_Pause> Legends of Runeterra is a pretty decent TCG right now and it's monetization is probably the best I've ever seen for a TCG.
[4:18:50] <chronoxgp> i l;ay ygo pro 2 on deskto[p only way to play
[4:19:00] <%SirGO0SE> yeah they really were the gacha, but unless youre giving cards out for free, how do you keep updating the game for 20 yrs like wizards has
[4:19:06] <GarbageNirvana> Woolie would probably be into stuff like Marvel Dice
[4:19:12] <%BinaryFireball> draft limits that but it's then pay to play
[4:19:13] <chronoxgp> has master rule 5 already
[4:19:17] <+eanscrale> THE SCALPERS
[4:19:21] <@Solidus_113> scum
[4:19:27] <+arcielardor> So are we seeing the birth of a new show, CardLords?
[4:19:31] <arkv01> schum

[4:20:53] <%SirGO0SE> @G03933 the only thing i like about current mtg cost is that the other formats are holding their value better
[4:20:57] <heartlesshealer> beware of power creep though if you get competitive
[4:21:09] <%BinaryFireball> the world needs more mecha fighting games

[4:22:10] <GarbageNirvana> I watch one then the other for the refresh
[4:22:30] <%SirGO0SE> there are ads on VODS how does that work?
[4:22:32] <Dragon_Batman> I usually leave youtube video play and watch on twitch
[4:22:41] <SuperKirby24> Couldnt catch the arms part, but thanks for the stream @WoolieVersus
[4:22:42] <+zetaplus> @OnlyNumber1 yes using a lot of quick play spell cards. they can form change during battle phase so you can keep attacking or activate effects after form change
[4:22:45] <@Solidus_113> VODs are already exclusive for the podcast streams
[4:22:47] <%SirGO0SE> i have a 2nd twitch account for the podcast subs lol
[4:23:16] <heartlesshealer> twitch vods treated as podcast and youtube vids for watching the gameplay since we don't get the talkies is how I do it
[4:23:22] <+zetaplus> @OnlyNumber1 oh sorry I meant yugioh
[4:23:51] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie what about the ads on VODs?
[4:23:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
