[0:03:07] <+elderpunch> it DOESNT include ppl who cant get vaxxed too which is VERY GOOD
[0:03:08] <FunkyStreams> all we need to do is make them wear a patch or sticker on their clothes to show their vaccine status.
[0:03:11] <shotguncrucifix> unvaxed people are a burden on the health care system
[0:03:12] <cartakus> @johnnyboymtl why?

[0:03:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CANADA WITH THE BIG BRAIN PLAYS
[0:03:57] <+blackacesolo> I think everyone should get vaccines, but tax punishments for not getting vaxxed is not okay

[0:04:12] <+toomuchsnarf> im vaxxed and got covid this shit ain't no joke man
[0:04:19] <+elderpunch> nah fax

[0:04:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ReallyBigRocks oh that's good LUL
[0:04:31] <+elderpunch> im getting a booster tmw
[0:04:33] <plaguedoctor_vi> I wnat to ask what about that wierd disease that causes Dementia on young people, that apear on canada, what you guys know about it?
[0:04:41] <+KingKrampus> @captainpiledriver same in Austria I think, the fine system isn't going to apply to people who can't be vaccinated because of legitimate health issues
[0:04:42] <shotguncrucifix> tax churches next
[0:04:43] <$Superdandy96> Unfortunately if my small town tries that, I‚Äôd be clamping down for a incoming riot
[0:04:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> it makes sense in a country with taxpayer funded healthcare, put an extra burden on the system, pay more for it
[0:04:47] <coreybom> Same thing in parts of the US. And some dumbasses have tried to BLOOD LET the vaccine out. Yeah.
[0:04:51] <%FrostedZaibatsu> 1 to 550k infected in Africa i heard, in a month
[0:04:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> My mom's friend was pissing blood in agonizing pain and the hospitals were too full to take him
[0:05:06] <leith_aziz> There was a trend of some people being against vaccine certificates being necessary to enter shops. What do you think about that, chat?
[0:05:07] <+elderpunch> @canadiananimatorguy goddamn
[0:05:14] <OldManDeckardCain> @ReallyBigRocks I guess we need to tax fat people drinkers and drug addicts as well
[0:05:16] <+blackacesolo> Also Vaccines don't prevent omicron, cause I still got it. I lived though and didn't need hospitalization.
[0:05:24] <+generalve> some wal Mary's are paying more than hospitals for nurses
[0:05:26] <%wolfofsound> that's fantastic
[0:05:26] <cartakus> sure
[0:05:29] <Ipsenscastle> that's smart

[0:05:44] <%wolfofsound> the US needs to do this too
[0:05:47] <+GoombaQueen> hell yeah
[0:05:48] <+KirbyAutomata> the deserve therapy too
[0:05:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> @OldManDeckardCain idk how it is in Canada but in the US unhealthy food has a higher tax on it
[0:05:54] <derap41> Better than fucking applauds
[0:05:55] <coreybom> @leith_aziz Those are private business, and they are allowed to make smart rules. Those dumb fucks can go home.
[0:05:55] <%JoshManVGH> "You will pay for this other persons suffering!"

[0:05:57] <leith_aziz> pickyBot pickyBot pickyBot
[0:06:01] <$Superdandy96> A buddy of mine got Covid, like, a month ago? He had almost all the symptoms except short breath. Instead he had bleeding gums
[0:06:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> in some places in the US at least
[0:06:06] <+elderpunch> the US would NEVER do that but they SHOULD
[0:06:06] <%LCLSmoothie> @wolfofsound with our health system? ain‚Äôt happening
[0:06:07] <+KingKrampus> @blackacesolo the only reason why I'm not in the hospital right now on a ventilator is because I got the vaccine and booster
[0:06:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> So should people with chronic illnesses pay more for healthcare?
[0:06:17] <coreybom> @reknownblackcat Please be fucking joking cause thats just gross.
[0:06:24] <leith_aziz> @coreybom I meant like shopping malls, but ok
[0:06:28] <%nicversus> we need that in ontario desperately I think
[0:06:29] <+toomuchsnarf> where I work you get paid more money for being vaxxed and having a booster even though it's still a remote job
[0:06:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> LET'S GO SPODER MANS!
[0:06:33] <+Mr_Pylon> book em for tax evasion if they fake a vax
[0:06:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CappuccinoGuil they didn't choose to have a chronic illness
[0:06:36] <goosematty> "I have finally become Spider-Man Miles Morales" is a top 10 title drop
[0:06:39] <+Nekros4442> @cappuccinoguil No, obviously theres exemptions for people in this kind of system
[0:06:45] <boogz____> No because chronic illness is not a choice duh
[0:06:47] <%wolfofsound> @toomuchsnarf nice shit
[0:06:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Based
[0:06:50] <%MyNameIsRasus> i'm still a month off till i can get my booster, brazil sucks
[0:06:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> covid isnt a chronic illness smh
[0:06:58] <withnocontext> does the tax get implemented only when hospitalized?
[0:06:59] <+reknownblackcat> @coreybom nope they are legit drinking urine as a way to fight Covid. it's real. they are really that dumb.
[0:06:59] <leith_aziz> Let's hope it was the correct decision
[0:07:00] <+Firgof> Y'all ready for Absolutely No Music Morales?

[0:20:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Fuck it, just tell all of woolieONEGUY that I said Fuck Guy One.
[0:20:01] <Aussie_Manny> Miles debuted in 2011.
[0:20:03] <%shadowsofpain> shadowsofpain subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Can't wait to not hear any music and see this exaggerated swagger I've heard so much about. Best of luck Woolie and Reggie
[0:20:03] <%RyTYoung> Miles is great
[0:20:09] <cartakus> FOR REAL
[0:20:09] <dadeaner> beyond
[0:20:11] <emptyantics> X23 also
[0:20:11] <brachydios777> Miles is great
[0:20:12] <odd_slater> YES
[0:20:14] <Kabron3> because he's just black Spiderman
[0:20:16] <TheLemuroid> Beyond
[0:20:18] <KeiganOfAstora> you said begins
[0:20:19] <+DatAsuna> *beyond, they did make begins xD
[0:20:19] <%wolfofsound> Beyond
[0:20:21] <+StabbityStyle> do a live action batman beyond
[0:20:21] <%kyh9> I dunno, spider verse is what really rebooted miles into a more likable version for me
[0:20:21] <Aussie_Manny> Where the FUCK is my Batman Beyond movie???
[0:20:21] <+KingKrampus> @joshmanvgh wolverine is a punk if he's not a dad to x kids
[0:20:21] <legacy0117> Dunno anything about Spider-men but still Woolie has lots of lore stored up I‚Äôm sure.
[0:20:22] <%aram909> michael keaton as old batman, tom holland as batman beyond
[0:20:23] <Dova573> tbf Miles was stuck in the Ultimate universe
[0:20:23] <%mr_sups> BATMAN BEEYOND IS RAD
[0:20:23] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:20:23] <%holydeviant1> I like Miles because he's more than just "black spoderman", he's a character unto himself and not just a P2 skin
[0:20:23] <emptyantics> Beyond is fucking great
[0:20:27] <+StooEsq> he probably meant Beyond
[0:20:27] <jorniev> WHERE'S STATIC!?
[0:20:28] <Samurai_Jake> beyond woolie
[0:20:29] <@Solidus_113> schway
[0:20:30] <%cisealnine> Don't remind me that they are wasting Batman Beyond by doing nothing with it.
[0:20:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> No, biggest "money on table" is Atlus and PC ports.
[0:20:33] <%mr_sups> BUT WE KNEW!
[0:20:35] <Dopamien> thats the one with liam neeeses
[0:20:38] <%megaman_sentinel> old Bruce Wayne is awesome
[0:20:41] <Aussie_Manny> Where the FUCK is Static Shock??
[0:20:42] <brachydios777> Anyone seen Electra Daredevil?
[0:20:44] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> that would be too cool
[0:20:44] <KeiganOfAstora> wait fuck Batman begins??!
[0:20:47] <Voidvas> more like Schwarbage Kappa
[0:20:48] <%KirbyAutomata> For gods sake we've never even had Nightwing show up in a live action movie
[0:20:48] <$Superdandy96> ‚ÄúMiles is a cool character‚Äù CANT BELIEVE WOOLZ TALK‚ÄôN SHIT ABOUT BATMAN. Kappa
[0:20:49] <+gitgouda> @Aussie_Manny ty
[0:20:49] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus Ah, another story that revolves around semen LUL
[0:20:50] <jvilly96> TERRY was od
[0:20:54] <emptyantics> 10/10 design
[0:20:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> But what if we rebooted Batman AGAIN????
[0:21:04] <xxshadowxx416> 1 big problem with co?ic they never move on
[0:21:05] <emptyantics> @brachydios777 Her design is fucking great
[0:21:07] <%OldManJEWc> @aussie_manny  A fantastic question
[0:21:08] <%megaman_sentinel> oh Bruce Wayne is awesome because he don't give a f***
[0:21:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Superdandy96 "Miles is a cool character" WOOLIE IS SHITTING ON SUPERMAN????
[0:21:11] <+Jaromero435> but what if Joker?
[0:21:13] <+AkronymCLT> Alliteration'll trip you up
[0:21:14] <+KingKrampus> @superdandy96 remember when he shat on the Gameboy
[0:21:15] <ThornJay> beyonds the one where nightwing got cucked right?
[0:21:18] <coreybom> @aussie_manny He‚Äôs coming. Micheal B. Jorden is producing i believe.
[0:21:19] <%wunp_fxs> man i miss batman beyond
[0:21:20] <%JoshManVGH> Miles is all the fun of Spider-Man without a handful of played out pieces of baggage.
[0:21:22] <BlackermanZX> goddamit i just want a continuation of Beyond
[0:21:22] <%aram909> realtalk: ben affleck was an ok batman who was stuck in bad movies
[0:21:23] <%holydeviant1> Batman Beyond was amazing, those villains always got super hard got
[0:21:24] <zacyzacyz> the suits think that people won't like it because it's not Bruce Wayne
[0:21:27] <%cisealnine> Terry is the coolest Batman, in my opinion.
[0:21:28] <cartakus> Also Old man bats
[0:21:32] <$Superdandy96> @brachydios777 hell yeah, Zdarsky‚Äôs been on fire. Love what he‚Äôs down to both Matt and Electra
[0:21:34] <%KirbyAutomata> @thornjay Live action, I mean
[0:21:37] <+BananaSlammuh> That Beyond reference in Court of Owls was such a tease
[0:21:38] <%RyTYoung> I hope it‚Äôs good
[0:21:39] <%Prevot> it's weird cause Pattinson coul totally have played Terry
[0:21:43] <%megaman_sentinel> old*
[0:21:47] <%aram909> if they made batman beyond with aged-up old-man-makeup ben affleck batman teaching a young terry portrayed by robert pattinson, that would be rad
[0:21:48] <%jinking79> they had zero hopes when they made Batman Beyond
[0:21:49] <Aussie_Manny> DarkKnight => DarkKnight => DarkKnight => DarkKnight => forever
[0:21:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> @megaman_sentinel Disagree, everyone's favorite Bruce Wayne is from TAS aka the Bruce who gave a fuck about others?
[0:21:54] <+Jiggisnipe> @Prevot I agree
[0:21:59] <zacyzacyz> @prevot that's a good point LUL
[0:22:01] <deviljhojho_> its time
[0:22:02] <%JoshManVGH> @prevot That would have been GREAT!
[0:22:04] <terry_irvin> DUNK ON EM
[0:22:04] <brunoberserk> if they do batman beyond ,IF ,probably not gonna be terry mcginnes , PROBABLY gonna be fucking damian or something DansGame
[0:22:08] <brachydios777> Electra Daredevil is upthere with Silk and Spider-Gwen in design
[0:22:08] <dds333a> @thornjay ESPECIALLY those
[0:22:09] <+DatAsuna> Speaking of Terry I hate that wally west has been benched for barry allen so much lately
[0:22:11] <coreybom> @prevot Ehh, maybe a few years ago. Not now of course.
[0:22:15] <+RJay80> Unlimited Dunking on Peter YEAHHH

[0:23:38] <+ElDragon_1> This game has a lot of love for Puerto Rico. I've never seen that in a videogame before and I really appreciate it.
[0:23:42] <%JoshManVGH> I think Woolie has talked about playing Spider-Man 1 on the podcast before
[0:23:45] <+solzan2000> yea performance and RT is the best option
[0:23:45] <TheeRabbi> Honestly, maybe that dude was being literal. Maybe he wants to watch you shit on Peter Parker. Maybe that's hit fetsih fanfic.
[0:23:49] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> 60FPS makes this game feel dope af
[0:23:50] <+McSoliace> you should turn off the music right in the beginning by the way

[0:24:47] <%kyh9> It's a blessing and a curse people don't read comics.  I'm happy people like Miles now but I knwo for a FACT that most people would be done with him if they had started with his original Bendis run
[0:24:48] <SmortyPuffin> it was fucking excellent
[0:24:50] <dds333a> Fantastic game
[0:24:51] <%X2Eliah> spoodermang

[0:27:09] <%kyh9> I think  it's hilarious they re-wrote Miles here to be more like spider-verse miles.  More music/art, less science nerd

[0:28:29] <LorcaNomad> peter's face change is bad
[0:28:31] <@Solidus_113> not tom holland

[0:28:33] <+shoryukenabotch> I wonder why???
[0:28:34] <deviljhojho_> id say if youre not familiar with the old face its not that bad
[0:28:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> It's a harsh baby face
[0:28:36] <%kyh9> IS IT SO HARD TO GIVE BLACK KIDS A DAD CHARACTER, YOU FUCKHEAD WRITERS
[0:28:37] <%ThePich> they whitewashed a white guy
[0:28:38] <%Prevot> it's discount tom holland
[0:28:38] <%Bread_Assassin> ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù
[0:28:39] <+generalve> the head doesn't match the body
[0:28:41] <%X2Eliah> Peter Parker should be 39 years old here
[0:28:42] <%hax_metatron> Peter's original face was so much better ... now he looks YASSIFIED
[0:28:42] <+DatAsuna> Nah it's smoother and less detailed too
[0:28:43] <%mr_sups> Make him TIRED and fucking BUSTED
[0:28:44] <+BoboDaHobo> new look fucking sucks
[0:28:46] <Johannen> Tom Holland baby face
[0:28:46] <%Prevot> looks younger than miles
[0:28:48] <%kyh9> AND JEFFERSON IS SUCH A COOL DAD
[0:28:49] <AstrodropGaming> He's now Tom Holland's stunt double
[0:28:55] <casualshinji> Brand synergy BS, I guess. Thanks Sony.
[0:28:56] <BlackermanZX> its totally ""not"" tom holland
[0:28:58] <+DatAsuna> The old face had more of those little lines and imperfections, looked less plastic
[0:28:59] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> he now looks like one of my sister's exes and is kinda annoying lol
[0:29:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's supposed to look like the VA more, but it sucks
[0:29:00] <deviljhojho_> he looks REAL young
[0:29:02] <AllenDeadman> them spider genes
[0:29:03] <%hax_metatron> YASSIFIED PETER
[0:29:04] <+chiazam> It was really jarring but I‚Äôm getting used to it
[0:29:05] <%kyh9> THEY MADE HIM LOOK LIKE TOM HOLLAND
[0:29:05] <+Jiggisnipe> 24 isn't really too old
[0:29:05] <%mr_sups> @ThePich woolieYIKES
[0:29:05] <Aussie_Manny> To be fair, Tom Holland is 25 and looks like he does.
[0:29:06] <taeko_ohnuki> ps4 looks better
[0:29:08] <dead_harmony13> they did it to match his VA better
[0:29:09] <emptyantics> "Not"Tom Holland
[0:29:10] <$Superdandy96> He just reminds me too much of Holland man.
[0:29:11] <+Mr_Pylon> gave him an splash of Hollandaise
[0:29:11] <leith_aziz> Hi again yall
[0:29:12] <DSD24> Hi guys!
[0:29:12] <%Prevot> the og face looked a bit like andrew garfield
[0:29:14] <%kyh9> THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO MAKE PETER LOOK LIKE TOM HOLLAND
[0:29:17] <+StabbityStyle> you can look young at 24
[0:29:19] <%kyh9> SYNERGY
[0:29:20] <brunoberserk> BABYFACE PARKER
[0:29:20] <brachydios777> Totaly defenitly not Tom
[0:29:20] <+chiazam> No way that Peter was with Black Cat
[0:29:24] <DSD24> Yo that jacket is nice
[0:29:26] <Virokwet> i also heard it was in part for mocap
[0:29:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> they claimed it was to make the "face match better for capture with Yuri Lowenthal", but we know its because of the MCU movies
[0:29:27] <Aldesso> last stand peter best peter
[0:29:31] <+StabbityStyle> man.... black cat <3
[0:29:32] <+DatAsuna> I remember being 24
[0:29:33] <ThornJay> I'm gonna assuming they'll age it out a bit for the second game.
[0:29:33] <+AkronymCLT> He's my age and he looks like someone my age
[0:29:33] <+MegadBlitz> 24 isn't old but stress can make you like 34
[0:29:34] <ErikFeral> tims
[0:29:36] <AnthonyJMax> lets go hype
[0:29:37] <%Kaito_Cam> MUSIC OFF
[0:29:40] <taeko_ohnuki> @StabbityStyle he looks like a kpop idol bro
[0:29:44] <DSD24> Yoooo those shoes
[0:29:44] <+crocodile_t34rz> But it looks worse with the baby face
[0:29:45] <lotharrio> @chiazam Well maybe that's why she preferred him to keep the mask on.
[0:29:46] <SlangPunk> Can confirm, I'm 28 and still getting confused for 18
[0:29:47] <Ipsenscastle> the weird bit was how they lied and said it was to be more compatible with Yuri's face
[0:29:48] <%KirbyAutomata> @stabbitystyle Sometimes you can look like an infant at 25 and still be carded like me lol
[0:29:48] <wamo_slamo> Damn his lips look so detailed
[0:29:52] <%mr_sups> Protect from the DMCA
[0:29:55] <@Solidus_113> Performance RT
[0:29:56] <Dio_TR> @stabbitystyle ain‚Äôt no way, if you are24 you are 6 years away from dying Kappa
[0:29:56] <legacy0117> 24? Geez being part Spider apparently extends a person‚Äôs growth rate.
[0:29:59] <leith_aziz> My problem is mostly that Peter is potrayed as already having been in this work for a good while. Giving him that "young" face kinda renders that point moot
[0:30:00] <%aram909> performance RT
[0:30:00] <%X2Eliah> 24 is when a lot of people that will be bald are going visibly bald
[0:30:01] <%aram909> is the best
[0:30:01] <@Menitta> I suggest at least checking out Ray tracing
[0:30:04] <%mr_sups> DMCA
[0:30:05] <%JoshManVGH> Aww I was hoping Saladin Ahmed was involved in the writing for the game, but it doesn't look like he was.
[0:30:05] <%Prevot> the og face looked 25-30, the new one looks sub 20
[0:30:07] <+McSoliace> i feel like he looks more like young tobey to me honestly
[0:30:08] <+Trask07> performance RT is the one
[0:30:09] <$Superdandy96> Also gawd damn black cat though. Can‚Äôt give the big boobas, so they give her a dump truck of a booty to make up for it
[0:30:09] <dead_harmony13> performance rt is best
[0:30:10] <Aussie_Manny> This on PS5?
[0:30:11] <+chiazam> You should put the audio settings to Headphones
[0:30:12] <%aram909> yes
[0:30:13] <ErikFeral> turn music volume completely off!!
[0:30:14] <+DatAsuna> why wouldn't you want RT?

[0:37:56] <%X2Eliah> Look at this fantastic 4 ripoff
[0:37:57] <%Shad0wTag> BUT HE ISN'T A BANE THO
[0:37:59] <Ipsenscastle> he's an intuitive first boss
[0:38:00] <Reveresao> WHY DOES HE HAVE HIS GEAR??
[0:38:00] <Arbal3st> Oh...it's just Rhino
[0:38:01] <leith_aziz> Or Edge of time...
[0:38:01] <+pectusumbra> kingpin was first in the last one I believe
[0:38:01] <kalyxchews> it's rhino's job to be a jobber
[0:38:01] <%aram909> @aram909 ok fine he was the sole exception
[0:38:01] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> rino big dodge tutorial lol
[0:38:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> To be fair that cage did literally nothing to  stop Rhino
[0:38:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:03] <hazeprojekt> its more shocker than rhino
[0:38:04] <asakura_ayase> Spider bane
[0:38:04] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Neversoft Spiderman was Scorpion  tho
[0:38:05] <BigYanno> He's such a good first boss. his movements are simple and he teaches you well
[0:38:05] <brachydios777> Usually Shocker
[0:38:06] <arkv01> better question why didn't they strip him of his armor before transporting him
[0:38:06] <casualshinji> It's okay, the helicopter pulled its punches.
[0:38:09] <GHouseduivel> Why did they let him wear his suit?
[0:38:10] <leith_aziz> Or Shattered Dimensions...
[0:38:10] <Invess> fearless prisoners
[0:38:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Reveresao he can't take it off in this
[0:38:11] <taeko_ohnuki> @WoolieVersus cool detail that miles probably has pete's suit from when he was a teenager
[0:38:13] <+kumaprime> the jobbers
[0:38:13] <Aussie_Manny> Time to save Christmas.
[0:38:14] <%Shad0wTag> @Reveresao Its literally fused to his spine he physically can't take it off
[0:38:16] <ErikFeral> At least Spider-Man on PS1/N64, Spider-Man2, Ultimate Spider-Man... etc
[0:38:19] <Johannen> Spider-Bane
[0:38:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> THROW HIM INTO FIRE
[0:38:20] <+thepizzascotsman> game audisuper muffled
[0:38:22] <cartakus> YOU THINK?
[0:38:22] <%townzzzzz> SPIDER STING
[0:38:28] <%X2Eliah> Oh it's the arkham asylum combat system?
[0:38:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> Game audio is suuuuuper weird
[0:38:29] <legacy0117> Because his gear is literally is fused to his body. PopCorn
[0:38:31] <+AurryVS> AERIAL RAVE
[0:38:38] <T_Sasquatch> I will say ps4 spiderman is the best combat in a spiderman game tho
[0:38:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> more dead
[0:38:46] <%nicversus> Maximum Spider, Maximum Drip
[0:38:46] <BlackermanZX> oh yeah audio is a bit muffled
[0:38:47] <%livlinn> grymP
[0:38:49] <ErikFeral> dead or critically injured
[0:38:50] <brachydios777> Insomiac played MAHVEL
[0:38:53] <+HeroSolaire> Audio is muffled woolie
[0:38:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> audio sounds fine to me
[0:38:54] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah Deff inspired, but Spiderman is more focused on dodging than countering
[0:38:55] <%RyTYoung> This combat is way better and inventive than Arkhams imo
[0:39:13] <dds333a> LUL
[0:39:15] <Dio_TR> LAST MINUTE DODGE
[0:39:16] <%Kaito_Cam> look at Spider-Man in the background
[0:39:16] <+HeroSolaire> @Ricky_Rexx its definitely muffled, compare woolie voice and the game
[0:39:23] <boogz____> It‚Äôs easy when you have Arkham to build off of
[0:39:25] <arkv01> zoomie spidey got his combat drip
[0:39:27] <Johannen> Audio is def wierd
[0:39:29] <cartakus> DEF NOT DEAD
[0:39:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's called a refractory period
[0:39:31] <ELFucilaNeroIV> @x2eliah kinda, but there's way less autocorrecting so positioning is important
[0:39:31] <scrumbotime> webbing people to walls or floors takes them out too
[0:39:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Wait a minute, Reggie is playing?
[0:39:35] <Aussie_Manny> Meanwhile Pete and Rhino in the back
[0:39:37] <%livlinn> ded
[0:39:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> I forgot how badly I want a PS5 until I see this game
[0:39:40] <%KirbyAutomata> yeah game audio sounds like a cord is loose
[0:39:45] <+thepizzascotsman> yeah the game audio is muffled
[0:39:45] <emptyantics> I wish MCU showed SpiderMan fight like this
[0:39:45] <+ArcanumArcanum> audio is definitely muffled. Was like this in Mortal Shell too. His PS5 setup is messed up or something
[0:39:49] <dds333a> @keiganofastora woolz
[0:39:52] <Aussie_Manny> Shut up, Pete! LUL
[0:39:53] <SomeAsianDood> Man the dodges look so slick. But yeah audio's muffled
[0:40:00] <deviljhojho_> its fuckin great
[0:40:03] <$Superdandy96> Loool
[0:40:05] <Dopamien> these criminals work fast
[0:40:06] <RayMan799> audo is garbo
[0:40:09] <OblivionSword1> muffled as susual
[0:40:10] <%KirbyAutomata> game audio specifically
[0:40:11] <LorcaNomad> audio is low yeh
[0:40:12] <+Ricky_Rexx> did like... every single cop get knocked out in the convoy?
[0:40:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah you guys are a tad loud
[0:40:12] <+Rafraud> tru
[0:40:14] <+toomuchsnarf> yeah it's a bit muffed
[0:40:16] <Aussie_Manny> The game audio is kinda muffled.
[0:40:16] <deviljhojho_> at least you can play it on the ps4
[0:40:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, game audio is bad, your voices are fine
[0:40:16] <ErikFeral> go into settings turn music to 1 or off
[0:40:20] <+ArcanumArcanum> @WoolieVersus it was muffled like this all of Mortal Shell too, but I guess nobody noticed
[0:40:26] <%Bread_Assassin> Was does a regular ass human being do when he‚Äôs being air-comboed?
[0:40:27] <arkv01> muffled audio, less chance of dmca /shrug
[0:40:28] <+arran_r> Man, Woolie making this combat look as slick as it gets.
[0:40:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> game audio is low - u guys are good
[0:40:29] <+toomuchsnarf> your voices sound clear though
[0:40:33] <cj_art> the music specifically sounds warbled
[0:40:33] <BigYanno> You guys are only loud in comparison
[0:40:35] <scrumbotime> Its more the game is low than you are high
[0:40:35] <CheyMix> its more of pete in the back
[0:40:36] <blue_grave> idk if it was just me but i felt that it was harder to down enemies as miles compared to peter
[0:40:43] <Aussie_Manny> You guys are fine, game audio's just an issue.
[0:40:43] <lonosis47> Game too loud
[0:40:43] <leith_aziz> I think I find the pacing of building combos and taking several enemies in quick sucession more entertaining in Arkham, but the air combat and risk/reward in Spiderman is more fun. Choose your pick I guess
[0:40:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> This might be your PS5 setup, Mortal Shell was weird too
[0:40:46] <coreybom> @ricky_rexx They were in front, so they most likely took most of the damage.
[0:40:46] <+HeroSolaire> its lower quality, not just lower sound
[0:40:49] <+Rafraud> Your audio is fine, game audio muffled
[0:40:52] <KeiganOfAstora> Reggie is playing?
[0:40:53] <+Exicuren> Maybe an option on the console
[0:40:53] <+Sajallday> @Bread_Assassin Hold thst
[0:40:57] <+HeroSolaire> yeah is game audio only
[0:40:58] <+Rafraud> Voice audio good
[0:40:59] <brachydios777> Woolie remembered the tech from Ps4
[0:40:59] <KeiganOfAstora> People may be streaming on lower quality
[0:41:04] <%Kaito_Cam> @blue_grave once you unlock [REDACTED] it's way easier
[0:41:06] <dds333a> @ricky_rexx the rest are still transporting, and the reinforcements got bodied
[0:41:09] <+NYCrownlessKing> photo mode test? @WoolieVersus
[0:41:10] <%X2Eliah> Gme audio could just be a 96kbps mp3
[0:41:16] <dds333a> @keiganofastora Woolie is playing
[0:41:17] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[0:41:19] <@Menitta> I can't tell because mobile and low service
[0:41:22] <%X2Eliah> Because it just sounds muddy, not queit
[0:41:25] <CeJaxon> no im on source quality its def muffled
[0:41:41] <brachydios777> Oh boy
[0:41:49] <%KirbyAutomata> Yeah, it sounds like a cord might be loose on your end or something
[0:41:53] <ELFucilaNeroIV> is it the ps5 3D audio thingy?
[0:41:54] <dude_bruhh> audio quality stream wise is always the same regardless of video
[0:41:55] <%aram909> it sounds like one or more channels seem muffled
[0:41:57] <%KirbyAutomata> like a headphone jack that's not plugged all the way in
[0:41:58] <T_Sasquatch> i just realized twitch has an auto audio compressor
[0:42:01] <+Catoclystic> Didn't someone else have an issue with the console 3D audio settings?
[0:42:08] <leith_aziz> cohh3
[0:42:09] <dds333a> @arcanumarcanum people mentioned it literally every stream
[0:42:10] <@Solidus_113> if you have the PS5 3D audio on yeah that'd do it
[0:42:10] <gangsta_oki> bruh
[0:42:10] <%Kaito_Cam> Fun Fact you can do the Spider-verse dive off buildings where he pulls out his phone and everything
[0:42:12] <blue_grave> @Kaito_Cam ik his special thing makes it easier but building it up felt riskier over just using a gadget with peter
[0:42:16] <leith_aziz> pickyMunch
[0:42:22] <CeJaxon> kinda like there are pillows stuffed in the speakers kind of sound
[0:42:23] <%aram909> @Catoclystic yeah it can be finnicky on twitch, just change it to stereo and see if its fixed
[0:42:23] <+McSoliace> its probably the ps5 setup since this happens mostly with console games
[0:42:26] <+Parrish_broadnax> Im hearing a Buzzing right now
[0:42:26] <%aram909> yeah all of it
[0:42:26] <+ArcanumArcanum> all game audio is muffled and tinny. Same as Mortal Shell
[0:42:30] <Zebroneath> pretty much all of it
[0:42:30] <Aussie_Manny> All of it.
[0:42:32] <BigYanno> yeah all of it was a bit muffled
[0:42:32] <%KirbyAutomata> It was just game audio, You guys are fine though
[0:42:32] <%X2Eliah> Kinda all of it yeah
[0:42:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> that makes sense
[0:42:35] <ELFucilaNeroIV> yeah because I have used 3D audio before and it does muffle the audio
[0:42:36] <+GoombaQueen> all of the in game stuff
[0:42:43] <casualshinji> I'd say it was the bass that sounded muffled.
[0:42:44] <+PunishedBuck> all game audio, you guys sound fine
[0:42:45] <CeJaxon> Yes, your audio is fine but the game is entirely screwed
[0:42:48] <MasterCosmic> Man i miss the sound tests
[0:42:49] <+HeroSolaire> Btw turn off the Controller Audio or the stream cant listen
[0:42:50] <BlackermanZX> i mean the muffled music is perfect for miles woolieSMUG
[0:42:54] <@Solidus_113> it'd be in the PS5 settings itself
[0:42:55] <Aussie_Manny> Hope it's an easy fix.
[0:42:56] <@Solidus_113> not game
[0:42:57] <+ElDragon_1> The whole game. You guys were fine.
[0:43:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> would that be a PS5 setting?
[0:43:01] <zacyzacyz> I didn't notice but I'm at work with bad headphones LUL
[0:43:06] <$Superdandy96> ^
[0:43:15] <BigYanno> Why would you not have Mono Audio as an option
[0:43:30] <lonosis47> The audio was also messed up for Mortal shell but no one wanted to say anything
[0:43:35] <+McSoliace> it was happening with mortal shell too
[0:43:37] <%X2Eliah> @BigYanno eh usually stereo (aka headphones) is good
[0:43:56] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[0:43:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> @lonosis47 less obvious because it blended into the overall jank lol
[0:43:59] <lonosis47> The entire Mortal shell LP audio was screwed up because of it
[0:44:00] <%jinking79> your welcome anime watchers
[0:44:02] <Aussie_Manny> hopefully.
[0:44:05] <+Rafraud> 3D audio is known to be ass lol
[0:44:14] <%KirbyAutomata> Just want to plug in a game and hit the go button

[0:44:35] <@Solidus_113> "3D" audio is mostly a joke like the fake 7.1 thing headphones usually have
[0:44:37] <dds333a> @lonosis47 people mentioned it literally every stream
[0:44:42] <brachydios777> Man, it sucks Spider-Man games is stuck on one platform now
[0:44:43] <%KirbyAutomata> Sounds good?

[0:54:55] <KeiganOfAstora> @Halospaz117
[0:54:57] <leith_aziz> Sad thing about Bane is that for a cool design, there are only 2-3 versions of him I find memorable. Knightfall and Arkham Origins
[0:54:59] <mr_mister0> combat seems better than the first game?
[0:55:00] <legacy0117> Because he‚Äôs a spider maybe?

[0:55:07] <Halospaz117> I know, I was talking in-universe perspective
[0:55:13] <KeiganOfAstora> Combat is the same as the first game, just less moves cuz you're not Peter Parker

[0:55:27] <%kyh9> @kyh9 So having chemical powers makes him too close to Spider Woman but having electricity powers doesn't make him too close to Static Shock or Black Vulcan or Black Lightning or Storm or ASM2 Electro?

[1:00:42] <$Superdandy96> It was nice of the guardians game to allow a streamer mode

[1:00:44] <%aram909> VENOM SMASH IS BROKEN AS HELL
[1:00:49] <+Ricky_Rexx> Kind of wish they gave it a different name, cause ya know, VENOM kinda means something else when spiderman is involved
[1:00:53] <Invess> @deviljhojho_ storm has weather powers not electric, Jakeem Thunder is a legacy character who had a white predecessor, also the genie has the powers not Jakeem
[1:00:55] <+OddityOn> @kyh9 I try not to think about it
[1:00:55] <%kyh9> @kyh9 couldn't you also call is poison?
[1:00:57] <%X2Eliah> So is the Venom power stuff rdalted to Venom the spiderman archvillain?
[1:00:58] <%KirbyAutomata> again, these are basically chain modifiers

[1:03:02] <%kyh9> Godadmnit, why can't they use Jefferson Davis as Miles Dad more
[1:03:06] <%kyh9> Miles hsould have a dad
[1:03:06] <FunkyStreams> also Asian
[1:03:10] <+eanscrale> ah yes, the sandal
[1:03:10] <%kyh9> At least ONE spider-man should have a dad
[1:03:12] <leith_aziz> SCOTT THE WOZ
[1:03:14] <HawkGoggles2> Spankings are emotinal
[1:03:14] <%kyh9> It might as well be miles
[1:03:16] <%notsoy> looks WAY too young
[1:03:17] <%kyh9> EUGH
[1:03:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> Miles instinctively dodges a beating with spider sense
[1:03:17] <deviljhojho_> they made her a more hands on science teacher to explain miles' love of it i guess
[1:03:18] <Mechazoic_Era> LIL BABY MAN

[1:03:30] <%jinking79> pulls out the sandal
[1:03:30] <+SolidusRex> Fun fact: in older Insomniac games (starting in Spyro 2 in 1999) Skill Points were an achievement system before achievements became mainstream, rather than the skill tree currency used in their Spider-Man games
[1:03:32] <Wynzler> Ugh the old face fits so much more
[1:03:32] <casualshinji> Go back to JC Penny you.

[1:04:55] <@Menitta> It's not always about da money Spidahman ....it's about da METS LOVE DA METS
[1:04:55] <%kyh9> Miles is so much more interesting with a dad
[1:04:59] <+Negus_Rex> they killed Jeff? booo
[1:05:00] <Eger007> 10 ton?
[1:05:00] <%cubbywolf> they aren't all gold
[1:05:01] <ErikFeral> "can rattle off dad jokes" but he isn't a dad
[1:05:03] <Aussie_Manny> They CAN be dad jokes!
[1:05:05] <Invess> @kyh9 agreed
[1:05:08] <dds333a> to a youngin like miles they sound like it LUL
[1:05:08] <ErikFeral> thus, they are bad jokes
[1:05:10] <%mr_sups> DA METS
[1:05:10] <%notsoy> that name is some "why should i change MY name when HE'S the one who sucks"
[1:05:14] <cartakus> zoomer
[1:05:14] <%jinking79> like Uncle jokes LUL
[1:05:16] <%Deekman> they're quips from our perspective but miles is a kid.
[1:05:19] <%sssoapy> Akrham system
[1:05:19] <Aussie_Manny> Timed combos.
[1:05:20] <%mr_sups> Arkham Style
[1:05:23] <lazysaiyajin> Spiderman pulling punches
[1:05:27] <Aussie_Manny> Very much like Arkham.
[1:05:32] <+chiazam> Peter‚Äôs quips is why other superheroes groan when he joins the team up
[1:05:34] <$Superdandy96> In miles pov? Those are Dad jokes
[1:05:35] <+OddityOn> Just don't try to overthink it
[1:05:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> Spider time
[1:05:40] <%KirbyAutomata> @menitta thank you Susato
[1:05:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you're under 5'11 and still over 150, you're not skinny at all. plus now Peter is more muscle. it's a gymnast build
[1:05:43] <leith_aziz> Wait, isnt the game spoiling the new suit? pickyAYAYA
[1:05:48] <zacyzacyz> I hope he has the costume I forgot how you get it
[1:05:51] <ErikFeral> Comics: Spider-Man pulls punches. Games: Hold my webshooters, I'm show em how to do an infinite...
[1:05:56] <Qsmash_> the new suit is on the cover
[1:05:59] <%FrostedZaibatsu> What if mom had a move list?
[1:06:00] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> @WoolieVersus  I think you can also hold LT to aim webs and manually slow down at any time.
[1:06:07] <+Ricky_Rexx> what is mom's move list
[1:06:13] <Aussie_Manny> Oohhh, I forgot about the Stealth!
[1:06:13] <Louie_Salmon> And "Venom skills"
[1:06:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:06:14] <dds333a> LUL
[1:06:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Spider-Man has always been lean not buff
[1:06:17] <+chiazam> That brother‚Äôs flying in the air, how could his hands do this
[1:06:22] <%KirbyAutomata> @ricky_rexx doggy, missionary, cowgirl
[1:06:23] <leith_aziz> Air-tricks are fun
[1:06:25] <deviljhojho_> the focus mechanic is basically an explanation of how peter manages to KO an enemy without straight up killing him crikIQ
[1:06:25] <Halospaz117> Can Miles do a McTwist?
[1:06:26] <%ChoculaUltra> has Miles ever straight up Burning Finger'd a villain in the comics? With the whole shock stuff I mean
[1:06:27] <+DeadManProp> How are they going to resolve the fact that he has "Venom" powers in SM2?
[1:06:27] <casualshinji> The venom combat makes it hard to back to the previous game.
[1:06:30] <brachydios777> Spider-Man could cave in faces if he wants to
[1:06:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @professor_dr_muffins You could always do that, including the first game
[1:06:31] <lotharrio> Tricks were good for restoring your super mode in the original.
[1:06:31] <+OddityOn> Exaggerated Swagger
[1:06:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> other Ned
[1:06:32] <Aussie_Manny> Web swinging tricks gets you a little EXP!
[1:06:35] <%Kaito_Cam> You do even do the spiderverse dive from the movie
[1:06:36] <ErikFeral> I hope Spider-Man 2 on PS5 has co-op play
[1:06:41] <lazysaiyajin> not Ned
[1:06:46] <brachydios777> Not Ned
[1:06:47] <ErikFeral> "Yeah, your Mom..." I almost flipped
[1:06:48] <+chiazam> Woolie the music is fine
[1:06:52] <deviljhojho_> ganke is the og
[1:06:55] <%Deekman> I'm up in the air if this or Fortnite has the best webswinging mechanics
[1:07:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> I got his whole head
[1:07:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ganke is BEFORE Ned
[1:07:04] <leith_aziz> Ultimate spiderman
[1:07:04] <+chief_chongo> ganke was in spider-verse but got cut
[1:07:12] <Aussie_Manny> So Miles totally just told his friend.
[1:07:15] <leith_aziz> Yes, in Ultimate
[1:07:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I also like that free fall has tricks too
[1:07:16] <+chief_chongo> or most of his stuff was cut
[1:07:20] <ErikFeral> The Guy In The Chair
[1:07:21] <dds333a> @aussie_manny yes
[1:07:22] <deviljhojho_> yeah they just took ganke and named him ned
[1:07:26] <+NeddTheNerd> ned PogChamp
[1:07:26] <%Kaito_Cam> They fused two characters
[1:07:27] <coreybom> Ned IS Ganke. Hell, ned leeds is in name only.
[1:07:30] <Joestar1890> That's exactly what they did
[1:07:31] <lotharrio> Well... Ned was a wildly different character in the original books.
[1:07:32] <+DatAsuna> MCU peter is just white miles
[1:07:33] <%mr_sups> They totally ripped off Miles for HomeComing Peter
[1:07:39] <+slayabee> You can unmute
[1:07:39] <Halospaz117> Technically the character Ned Leeds existed, he was just completely different
[1:07:42] <+Ricky_Rexx> It's a PS5? wow
[1:07:42] <dds333a> Yeah, because comics Leeds is dramatically different
[1:07:45] <+OddityOn> incoming best costume lol
[1:07:47] <+chiazam> Music
[1:07:48] <irisluv333> they cut out a lot of ganke's role in itsv because of Ned in homecoming
[1:07:48] <%KirbyAutomata> Southeast Asian I think
[1:07:50] <leith_aziz> uhhh...
[1:07:50] <+SolidusRex> MCU Peter is just white Miles
[1:07:51] <%townzzzzz> A NEW SUOOOIT
[1:07:52] <Ipsenscastle> Homecoming Ned is just Ganke, and they just gave him Ned Leeds' name, which is a completely different character who was Hobgoblin once
[1:07:52] <+BananaSlammuh> Jon Watts MCU mix characterizations. Ned Leeds never acted like Ganke
[1:07:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they cut Ganke and made Ned instead since Ganke is Miles
[1:07:54] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, Ned is Filipino.
[1:07:54] <$Superdandy96> I remember hearing that was intentional.
[1:07:54] <%jinking79> they couldn't get harry
[1:07:54] <dds333a> Hobgoblin and shit
[1:07:55] <+chiazam> No this is the bad one
[1:07:56] <JacknZack27> You can probably unmute now
[1:08:02] <Invess> who are these stans for comics Leeds
[1:08:04] <%ZweihanderSteve> DONT MENTION IT
[1:08:04] <+DatAsuna> It's good though, spiderverse onyl improved miles because MCU pete forced them to not just do ultimate miles
[1:08:05] <deviljhojho_> THIS COSTUME LUL
[1:08:06] <%aram909> I thought Ganke was Thai, must have misremembered
[1:08:09] <+chief_chongo> ned can still become hobgoblin surely
[1:08:09] <lazysaiyajin> eh
[1:08:09] <+OddityOn> LOL
[1:08:10] <Aussie_Manny> Music... ON!
[1:08:11] <+Jaromero435> Drip
[1:08:11] <deviljhojho_> Looks like pajamas
[1:08:12] <%Kaito_Cam> LAME
[1:08:13] <%wolfofsound> SICK
[1:08:13] <KeiganOfAstora> No color on the back looks weird
[1:08:14] <Louie_Salmon> That's VERY classic!
[1:08:15] <+MegadBlitz> boring but damn

[1:08:16] <odd_slater> LOL

[1:08:44] <Aussie_Manny> Sooooooo many suits.
[1:08:45] <dds333a> they are the ATTRACT
[1:08:45] <%nicversus> How does peter have the time to design a suit with a full on hud and animations
[1:08:46] <%aram909> each suit has its own special abilities too
[1:08:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeahhh the first suit is a lil silly
[1:08:47] <BigYanno> "A bunch" Dude there's like 50
[1:08:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can change to the TRACK suit before the Cutscene starts
[1:08:48] <casualshinji> Where'd Peter get all this super tech, seriously?
[1:08:48] <scrumbotime> Spider-man has a LOT of cool suits
[1:08:50] <%Shad0wTag> Most of Miles are made for this game!

[1:20:22] <Gadagast> my favourite part of that car are the rubber bullets you fire that send people flying across the street

[1:40:47] <Ashrox117> According to the universe that broken window killed everyone
[1:40:49] <+DeadManProp> Cheer500 So Miles's electric powers are called "Venom" powers. We also know that THE Venom will appear in Spider-Man 2. How do you think they will handle this confusion?
[1:40:53] <brachydios777> The Orange works with the black suit

[1:41:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:41:21] <martinhadameme> Do you think the suicide squad game will have freeform combat ala bamham or combat more similar to insomniac's spiderman games?
[1:41:22] <Dave_VD> I do not like the swinging music in either of these games. Gets super repetitive

[1:42:16] <coreybom> @martinhadameme Most likely similar to spiderman, especially since it looks like it mainly focused to shooting.

[1:54:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> no doorbell noises :)
[1:54:41] <leith_aziz> *when streaming
[1:54:41] <AstrodropGaming> If you talk REAL loud, you can override the music probably
[1:54:41] <lotharrio> This is a huge apartment.
[1:54:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> There are fuckers that will try to claim public domain
[1:54:45] <%sssoapy> true
[1:54:53] <KeiganOfAstora> Is the risk losing the channel or just not making money off this stream?
[1:54:54] <+KID_KUMA> @WoolieVersus Isn't streaming wonderful?
[1:54:55] <shieldecho> Yeah now just keep the volume down till you get back outside, trust me
[1:54:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> NotLikeThis
[1:54:56] <%strakillias> This makes it official Jazz is not music. Its SFX for mood
[1:54:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> It was probably SFX because it's playing from an object in the environment influenced by player position.
[1:54:57] <MindlessMonks> Nothing gets DMCA in this game
[1:54:58] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> burn the system instead
[1:54:58] <ELFucilaNeroIV> thats the correct choice
[1:55:01] <Little_xim> @keiganofastora depends
[1:55:02] <+thecowpow> Lol no sound effects now. Miles is deaf. This is a timeline where he became Hawkeye
[1:55:03] <TheBigPutty> what doorbell?

[2:06:55] <mortificent> Capitalism is a fuck

[2:07:01] <dds333a> THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO
[2:07:02] <+Trask07> the world trade center is also different in this game
[2:07:03] <KeiganOfAstora> No Chrysler Building anymore
[2:07:05] <%cubbywolf> how is it not a historic landmark now?
[2:07:09] <%KirbyAutomata> I called that the Jenga building
[2:07:10] <+slayabee> Tetris Building?
[2:07:11] <crazy_riggs> Freedom Tower?
[2:07:13] <%cubbywolf> thats where avengers tower goes now I guess
[2:07:20] <leith_aziz> Well, there was the Twin Towers, allthough there was a way more sympathetic reason as to why
[2:07:21] <+StooEsq> No Chrysler Building bonus dungeon in a Parasite Eve Remake, then
[2:07:24] <legacy0117> That‚Äôs insane. Even buildings are included too? zitoWhat
[2:07:24] <KeiganOfAstora> Chrysler Building is so iconic though
[2:07:25] <tentavision> what's the Tetris building I need to know
[2:07:31] <%cubbywolf> if you swing around the game you can find it
[2:07:40] <KeiganOfAstora> Does this NYC have the One Trade Center memorial @WoolieVersus
[2:07:40] <TheBigPutty> just call it the chevy building or something
[2:07:40] <%livlinn> That means we can replace that with whatever cartoon villain headquarter!! spaceyeenYeen
[2:07:41] <QueequegTheater> Oh no, puzzles
[2:07:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the Tetris BUilding is a different Freedom Tower in this game, Avengers Tower is in its proper location
[2:07:44] <foghornleghorn55> This game still has the stupid signal missions?

[2:08:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> all you need was a box of nails to shove into his mouth
[2:08:22] <KeiganOfAstora> Unfortunately, Insomniac Games just couldn't reach an agreement with the copyright owners of the Chrysler Building, which is why it isn't included.
[2:08:24] <+BackwardCap> "HEY!" *dies*

[2:09:22] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Weird his nails are the same color as his hands
[2:09:23] <+chiazam> Gadgets BREAK the game and I love it
[2:09:25] <ErikFeral> Miles has fingerless gloves, in winter. While also fighting crime
[2:09:27] <Aussie_Manny> A STAND?!
[2:09:31] <dds333a> neither did I
[2:09:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:09:36] <%ZweihanderSteve> yeah the gadgets were def a fun thing to tool around with.
[2:09:38] <dds333a> I hated using them
[2:09:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can't use the Baxter BUilding either because that's on Yancy St
[2:09:41] <%KirbyAutomata> Rather have options and not use them then want some and not have any.
[2:09:41] <LoneFonte> always used the little bots
[2:09:42] <P0wderedT0astMan> @solidusrex They could find a GIANT LIZARD in a City like NY. dumb movie
[2:09:44] <%cubbywolf> there are a few gadgets that are fun to use but most are boring
[2:09:44] <T_Sasquatch> you can totally break the game with all the gadgets and powers
[2:09:46] <%atlasdotwav> To be fair they didn't leave them behind
[2:09:47] <Megafang2145> chores!
[2:09:47] <+OddityOn> @erikferal yeah but drip tho
[2:09:50] <Aussie_Manny> Kono stando power ga!
[2:09:54] <%cubbywolf> at least this game has fun traversal unlike ubisoft games
[2:09:55] <fluke_LKZ> You know, Kontent(tm)
[2:09:57] <%KirbyAutomata> But getting around is so much fun that I don't mind getting all the collectibles
[2:09:57] <GHouseduivel> Yeah but this is fun.
[2:09:58] <DXLelouch24> combats fun tho so its fine
[2:10:00] <CheyMix> only thing i dont like about miles in this is how he can make gagets like he's an tech engineer.
[2:10:06] <mortificent> Yeah, but at least climbin the tower is fun
[2:10:08] <JehutyVer2> except they're fun to traverse to and quick
[2:10:09] <QueequegTheater> """"Content""""
[2:10:11] <emptyantics> But this time fun!
[2:10:14] <@Menitta> It's weird how Sony now kicks the shit out of the typical open world genre.
[2:10:17] <+ElDragon_1> Gadgets are a life saver on Ultimate difficulty
[2:10:18] <ErikFeral> @OddityOn yeah but fingerprints on the walls and the ceiling in a crimescene
[2:10:20] <DXLelouch24> @CheyMix Peter and Ganke rubbed off on him obviously
[2:10:29] <@Menitta> With Spiderman, Tsushima, and Horizon
[2:10:29] <dds333a> Still Ubi LUL
[2:10:30] <+OddityOn> @cheymix  he kinda is tho
[2:10:35] <stonenerdpotatoman> What if Mike‚Äôs just got his tech from Peter like a spidey connect
[2:10:38] <CheyMix> @DXLelouch24 i get making an app and hacking but this
[2:10:38] <%nicversus> @DXLelouch24 not literally I hope
[2:10:40] <%cubbywolf> the venom abilities are super useful
[2:10:41] <stonenerdpotatoman> Miles
[2:10:42] <leith_aziz> I cant help but feel open world games are kinda f*cked for the forseeable future now because of how often they ended up a disaster in some shape or form
[2:10:44] <QueequegTheater> @OddityOn Spiders don't have fingerprints
[2:10:52] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda hoping the Insomniac Wolverine game isn't open world but that's just me
[2:10:54] <mortificent> 40 degrees?

[2:13:57] <Invess> @xxshadowxx416 madripor
[2:13:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just fight guys who don't bleed RED
[2:14:04] <ElementCatacle> Is it Reggie playing the game?
[2:14:06] <TheBigPutty> uncle aaron was always out killing SPIDERS Kappa
[2:14:07] <%kyh9> WHAT DO YOU MEAN "YOU GUYS"
[2:14:09] <dds333a> @cartakus his knuckles I think
[2:14:11] <coreybom> @blue_grave Oh no. The site the trailer is one requires a birthday to watch it. It‚Äôs definitely going to M rated.
[2:14:11] <@Menitta> I forgot Insomniac was making Wolverine
[2:14:12] <+OddityOn> @cartakus on his knuckles yea
[2:14:17] <CheyMix> back trik while falling
[2:14:17] <%KirbyAutomata> You can only do that with the spider verse suit I think
[2:14:18] <Jonami90> I think that's when you run off a building's roof
[2:14:19] <Little_xim> @xxshadowxx416 I think it‚Äôs gonna be in madripor, the same island the third episode of the Falcon series visits
[2:14:21] <%wolfofsound> airchrist
[2:14:25] <CheyMix> hold it
[2:14:27] <%cubbywolf> you gotta get him to face the camera, where he kinda spins out of controll and does a 180, hard to describe
[2:14:27] <leith_aziz> Maybe Insomniac can take some feedback from X-Men Origins. Wolverine (the GAME). That game had no right being as good as it was
[2:14:31] <+BackwardCap> You can look up the trick movelist
[2:14:32] <+slayabee> @KirbyAutomata You can do it without it
[2:14:33] <leith_aziz> pickyEZ
[2:14:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> if aaron was a gundam pilot would it be ‚àÄron
[2:14:39] <cartakus> So some blood atleast
[2:14:40] <%cubbywolf> I found it easy to get into by doing tricks
[2:14:41] <%Kaito_Cam> Miles has to be facing backward in his swing to do that one. or jump off a building backwards
[2:14:43] <Virokwet> what trick?
[2:14:44] <+elderpunch> easiest way to do it is just jump off a building
[2:14:44] <+OddityOn> To do the relax pose you have to let yourself fall from the edge of a building @woolieversus

[2:14:47] <T_Sasquatch> i dont think the wolverine game is open world
[2:14:49] <cheapdoc> gotta lab it up
[2:14:54] <coreybom> God that Wolverine game is going to be outright disgusting if they go all the way.
[2:14:59] <%aram909> @leith_aziz xmen origins wolverine the game is unironically better than god of war
[2:14:59] <stonenerdpotatoman> That game had EVERY right to be as good as it was XD
[2:15:03] <@Menitta> I love how there's a list for tricks
[2:15:06] <leith_aziz> I dont think Logan would work as open world
[2:15:07] <+Zeroblazex> @woolieversus to get the spiderverse pose you have to be fast dropping backwards and hold square up
[2:15:07] <+OddityOn> it's a secret pose
[2:15:12] <%cubbywolf> iit might be hidden
[2:15:13] <leith_aziz> Unless he could take a cab or something
[2:15:14] <emptyantics> Can‚Äôt wait for a second Rated M Wolverine game
[2:15:20] <+dekkitout> Speen
[2:15:23] <Virokwet> it think you have to face miles away from his fall
[2:15:24] <%cubbywolf> it's a contextual animation I think
[2:15:26] <Aussie_Manny> pocket73PadoruSpin
[2:15:33] <%KirbyAutomata> maybe you need the spider verse suit?
[2:15:34] <%slimmixrp> Maybe its only in the spider verse suit
[2:15:34] <CheyMix> its with the back
[2:15:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> just neutral tricck button
[2:15:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the Spider Verse pose, I forgot what it was
[2:15:37] <%jinking79> it's part of the dive
[2:15:42] <%cubbywolf> that was it
[2:15:44] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz That sounds a lot like apples and oranges, my guy
[2:15:44] <%cubbywolf> almost
[2:15:47] <emptyantics> He has to be facing backwards

[2:15:51] <Xelhesia> Right there
[2:15:58] <+samuraiknack> Isn't it up twice on the stick

[2:39:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ShinobiPhoenix isn't a it a thing in Spider-man that he takes A LOT of care to control his strength and not really hurt people in fights?

[2:39:56] <ErikFeral> Superhero comics like Invincible where they just show exactly what happens to the human body from superhuman BS is my favorite niche interest
[2:39:58] <%aram909> @Menitta stealing from a homeless shelter is a new low maybe these people DO deserve to get bodied by a manhole cover
[2:40:07] <TheMadDemoknight> Mile's comms guy has something going on with those emojis lol
[2:40:10] <@Menitta> Who steals from a homeless shelter?!
[2:40:13] <%MightyDuckShoes> Aren't they the PDNY because the NYPD is ALSO copyright restricted?

[3:10:58] <enerkaizer> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends Ock never officially became spider-man, he just robbed the title. everyone else earned the mask actually
[3:11:02] <QueequegTheater> Eventually they're run out of bullets

[3:11:58] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag Not quite correct. He tried to be better then peter, but he failed. He never actually became spider-man. He was just immitating him
[3:12:01] <mortificent> @atmos_alt Tbh, Marvel has at least 3 9/11s each year
[3:12:02] <%andrewofbob> Ok, but water on a petrol fire????

[3:12:44] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer He was still Spidey if not for a single night
[3:12:44] <martinhadameme> Superior Spiderman is like Tom King's Batman run, great until the authors reach a point where they're not allowed to make cool permanent changes to the character
[3:12:47] <Little_xim> @samuraiknack honestly, I love superior Spider-Man
[3:12:51] <%emptyantics> Ben Reilley is so fucking cool

[3:13:25] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag no, he wasn't. That was the point of Kravens last hunt. He failed, and peter actually did the job right
[3:13:26] <+shootbang_exe> IT'S A GOOD SCENE
[3:13:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BECAUSE IT'S GREAT
[3:13:26] <derap41> Its the one that made it a meme

[3:13:43] <%Shad0wTag> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends Miles is only slightly physicallly weaker than Peter in ultimate comics due to his age
[3:13:43] <%pyrojack6> Train fight still GOAT
[3:13:46] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Oh, that is her

[3:13:49] <%legacy0117> Every. Time.
[3:13:53] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Spider-Man pulls things together and he lifts he LOVES to lift things that are too heavy
[3:13:55] <QueequegTheater> It's Shocker
[3:13:58] <%dds333a> Big Hero, Big Heroism, you know the rest
[3:14:00] <+DatAsuna> or it's reused model lol
[3:14:02] <%pyrojack6> same model

[3:14:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> how did she get from the rally to here in like 2 minutes?
[3:14:07] <%emptyantics> Everyone can agree that the Boat one is the weakest right?
[3:14:08] <+chiazam> This is all your fault
[3:14:11] <VincentGraves> timbs are still clean
[3:14:14] <derap41> And now the city is bankrupt
[3:14:14] <enerkaizer> I think Peter could l√∂ift up to 25 tons in his prime canonically.
[3:14:14] <%mr_sups> NO YOU DIDN'T MILES
[3:14:14] <+chiazam> Arest him
[3:14:15] <DXLelouch24> run Miles

[3:24:49] <enerkaizer> I'm positivly surprised they figured out how to give Miles a a lot of alt. costumes despite not having much in the comics yet
[3:25:05] <fluke_LKZ> That guy is a hater
[3:25:11] <%Shad0wTag> On the Ultimate Spier-Man show they tried getting around the whole muliple spider-man problem by having Miles go by being called Kid Arachnid, as you can tell it never took off

[3:34:56] <%mr_sups> @jonblnt One of Darkseids goons while mind controlled I think
[3:35:04] <%aram909> @jonblnt theres this old kinda messed up comic where he and this other villainess are hypnotized by this other villain to do softcore porn together
[3:35:10] <T_Sasquatch> anyone remember the ps2 spiderman car chases ? where you just punch the roof like a mad man
[3:35:10] <%dds333a> Also Livewire
[3:35:11] <%aram909> well, its implied softcore porn
[3:35:14] <+chadcialist> little confusing to call Miles's powers Venom when Venom already exists no?
[3:35:17] <%aram909> because comics code authority
[3:35:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when you Google it, Google still says Disney+ has it
[3:35:23] <RaiKenSamaX> oh shit black teen simulator
[3:35:29] <%aram909> @chadcialist venom doesnt exist yet in these games
[3:35:31] <+OmegaZeroX2> @t_sasquatch yep doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[3:35:32] <brachydios777> @aram909 Sorry, from what now?
[3:35:33] <Parapattern> Coz
[3:35:56] <ErikFeral> cops working behind the scene
[3:35:58] <+Sajallday> has woolie unlocked any more suits yet?
[3:36:00] <brachydios777> @aram909 oh, that comic, ew
[3:36:01] <enerkaizer> @chadcialist That#s because the writers couldn't decide if Miles uses electricity or if he actually uses poison to paralyze his enemies. It took them years to finally decide on that. no joke
[3:36:01] <+chadcialist> @chadcialist i know, but aren't Miles's powers called venom in the comics too?
[3:36:03] <%notsoy> the best thing out of this game is that clip of the cop inexplicably pointing his gun at spiderman
[3:36:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Remember, cops don't actually stop crime, they simply arrive late to assess property damage
[3:36:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @chadcialist Venom under that NAME doesn't exist, but the person who is Venom iss already wearing the suit since the previous game
[3:36:06] <II0ZenMaster0II> There was an issue of Superman where a villain names Sleeze brainwashes Superman into having sex with Big Barda.

[3:36:16] <%notsoy> HELL NO
[3:36:18] <ThornJay> @aram909 i could've sworn there was a line in he first game where peter gets awkward when asked about a black suit
[3:36:25] <%fuji_n2> everytime woolie
[3:36:27] <%dds333a> :( :( :(
[3:36:27] <+dekkitout> This is why we gotta distinguish with Venom and Venom ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

[3:36:36] <ErikFeral> You're apologizing to JJ? You ARE a masochist!!!
[3:36:36] <QueequegTheater> Correct
[3:36:37] <ELFucilaNeroIV> :(
[3:36:38] <tentavision> you can keep swinging
[3:36:44] <+StabbityStyle> you can go back and listen to it in the menu, tho
[3:36:45] <+RavenicusCrow> so its not symbiote suit stuff its just called venom powers?
[3:36:50] <ErikFeral> Don't interrupt verbal abuse

[3:36:57] <enerkaizer> People forget that Superman had 2 different girls stalking him (Maxima and Obsession)
[3:36:57] <Make_me_mad> @CappuccinoGuil I've been worse. This actually feels a lot like when I got my second shot.
[3:37:01] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:37:02] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> It might play again. A lot of times, dialogue that gets interrupted is programmed to seamlessly restart after a minute.
[3:37:03] <brachydios777> @ravenicuscrow Venom in name only
[3:37:07] <QueequegTheater> I follow him on Parler
[3:37:07] <+RavenicusCrow> that's funny
[3:37:09] <+chadcialist> JJ slinging snakeoil supplements in the movie was a good bit
[3:37:10] <slippery_arms> itll pop back up but you gotta do somethin to activate jj again
[3:37:12] <JacknZack27> It might play again on its own
[3:37:13] <Ashrox117> We were finally about to find out where Q is!!!

[3:38:52] <ErikFeral> Spider-Man's putting Webs into the water, making all the kids swing with swagger!!!!
[3:38:54] <%mr_sups> Fun fact: Darin DePaul is the voice of JJJ. And also the voice of Dr. Samual Hayden.
[3:38:56] <%barkon345> what level is he?
[3:39:02] <enerkaizer> @Make_me_mad They still did those storylines. look up the villainess obession for example. she was a yandere stalking supes after he got married
[3:39:07] <%dds333a> @make_me_mad it would be interesting, but I guess I'm good with or without LUL
[3:39:13] <%emptyantics> JJJ would say he‚Äôs antivaxx but be caught getting vaxxed on tv
[3:39:15] <+Rafraud> God I wish Incredibles 2 was watchable
[3:39:29] <%DensityD> flashing lights
[3:39:38] <ErikFeral> near every game has photosensitive warnings
[3:39:41] <%Juriasu> I don't know if that one would trigger? it wasn't very bright
[3:39:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> literally ever game from the last 2 decades has a seizure warning
[3:39:49] <TheeRabbi> budget =/= caring about people
[3:39:50] <+OddityOn> I never had that issue when playing and I've had seizures
[3:39:56] <QueequegTheater> You wanna increase the Dodge Window, Woolie?  Kappa
[3:39:56] <+chadcialist> "I'm not saying I'm anti-vax but I did see SPIDER-MAN getting the vaccine, i'm just asking questions" -JJJ
[3:39:58] <%DensityD> woolieONEGUY
[3:40:02] <+OddityOn> didn't look that bad
[3:40:03] <%Shad0wTag> I believe it has to be brighter right?
[3:40:04] <+meatmaaan> dont most games have that warning right at the start?
[3:40:05] <MarioGalaxyMan25> It is a half game, maybe because Spider-Man 1 didn't have flashing lights they just ported over the options from 1 without realizing?
[3:40:16] <+Rafraud> Game is pretty tame with frequencies but yeah that screen is annoying
[3:40:20] <%dds333a> @queequegtheater LUL
[3:40:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the TYPE of flashing matters and that doesn't trigger because it's not bright enough and not at the first frequency of flashes
[3:40:29] <%emptyantics> @chadcialist LUL LUL LUL
[3:40:34] <Ashrox117> I think the threat of spider powers from the vaccine would get us to 100% innoculation
[3:40:37] <%MajorCrasher> Incredibles 2 is fine imo. woolie's the only person I've ever heard complain about it
[3:40:40] <Dopamien> what is the underground doing on a roof?

[3:41:31] <+OddityOn> I loved the credits too
[3:41:32] <+chadcialist> ngl being webbed up on the side of a building would 100% convince me to give up crime
[3:41:34] <+HeroSolaire> with Incredibles 1 being probably the best movie Pixar ever made, 2 is a lazy cash grab that adds nothing
[3:41:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> I do appreciate this game's villains having more cake than the previous installment.
[3:41:41] <+Zero_Jacks> Wait was that a Poke of a God
[3:41:48] <+burnie_mcburntface> @majorcrasher Really every I saw mentioned that scene
[3:41:48] <QueequegTheater> You cannot I'm pretty sure
[3:41:56] <QueequegTheater> Well fuck
[3:41:57] <%Juriasu> if only there was some sort of newly obtained stealth mode....
[3:42:07] <+HeroSolaire> @MightyDuckShoes wym, Otto was a great character, probably better than this game villains
[3:42:23] <QueequegTheater> @MightyDuckShoes ????
[3:42:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> need the mod that lets you stealth kill without the noise
[3:42:33] <+OddityOn> I don't think it was a cash grab considering people wanted an Incredibles 2 for a long time, much more than anyone asked for Matrix Resurrection...
[3:42:34] <%Juriasu> air yank is pulling them up for a combo
[3:42:37] <ThornJay> @herosolaire to be fair, otto had an actual full length game to develop
[3:42:38] <JacknZack27> I remember my theater had to post warnings outside before you got your tickets for Incredibles 2
[3:42:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> since the strike on the ground still causes noise
[3:43:04] <+TopTieramisu> YYET
[3:43:05] <+chadcialist> i fee like this game had the problem where the writers didn't want to waste a good major villain on a side game.
[3:43:06] <%MightyDuckShoes> @MightyDuckShoes He was thicc. You right.
[3:43:06] <enerkaizer> Miles is a shoto confirmed
[3:43:08] <+HeroSolaire> @OddityOn cash grab that it was a poorly thought and lazily written movie
[3:43:08] <+Rafraud> I don't think it was a cash grab, its just amazing that it got past ANY quality check

[3:45:44] <Make_me_mad> I think the reason I like Miles so much is that he's Spider-Man without the Peter Parker baggage, so I can still enjoy him. Like, Peter sold his marriage to the devil, and he once beat up the Rhino because he saw him in a graveyard, and he left him unconscious on top of his mother's grave. Peter's a dirtbag.
[3:45:50] <Playerbam> swita

[3:50:19] <+AWKWARDL0SER> aw poor Jay Lethal
[3:50:20] <enerkaizer> @brachydios777 There is still time for that. PS5 Spider-Man 3 feels like they could introduce him as the third playable character
[3:50:21] <%emptyantics> It‚Äôs radioactive
[3:50:23] <+TopTieramisu> comics is just a source of material that other adaptations can borrow from as far as i'm concerned. following the comics continuity sounds like a headache
[3:50:24] <brachydios777> Back to formula?
[3:50:34] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus This could be a 5G allegory if someone reached enough

[3:51:23] <%KirbyAutomata> You think Miles?
[3:51:26] <moonmintparadise> Good intentions, VERY BAD execution
[3:51:33] <morningmoondude> he's trying to give the whole city Boneitis so the mets never win again

[3:52:05] <+dekkitout> Miles, ffs there was a convient hole in the wall ya made
[3:52:12] <brachydios777> @enerkaizer These games are usually contained in their own universe, I‚Äôm not really expecting multiverse in these games anytime soon

[3:53:23] <+TopTieramisu> man their vision is terrible
[3:53:26] <brachydios777> @enerkaizer True, but I would expect multiverse in the games after the 3rd one maybe

[3:53:46] <Invess> @chadcialist I really hope they address that he crossed over in that game
[3:54:12] <%Shad0wTag> @P0wderedT0astMan Well that was just a teacher lusting over his own student which is sadly somewhat realistic
[3:54:18] <enerkaizer> @brachydios777 They can either use Ben or Miguell for the third player character in the future, I'm just spitballing ideas how they could introduce him without the baggage
[3:54:21] <%emptyantics> @p0wderedt0astman Doesn‚Äôt Jackal rape her in one of the old issues?

[4:43:37] <%DensityD> it's a big city, sometimes you want to fast travel, the web-swinging is good tho
[4:43:39] <@Menitta> Their interior tech is impressive as is

[4:43:48] <@Menitta> at least the PS4 game was
[4:43:49] <OkamiDude15> @TopTieramisu i think there was a cave exploring game that used something like echolocation to see your surroundings
[4:43:51] <TenguGemini> A lot of those rooms in the windows are not actually 3D modeled, they use different tech that is less resource intensive for that

[4:48:53] <%dds333a> @alfredfromthedusk Frank might kill himself then, depending on the continuity LUL
[4:49:13] <%KirbyAutomata> Sounds like Jason DeRulo

[4:51:45] <GHouseduivel> Little bit of zip zoom there
[4:51:52] <%Juriasu> same jacket and hat, the one on the bridge had reddish hair and light skin
[4:52:04] <%SomeAsianDood> sussy
[4:52:08] <JacknZack27> Was that actually her on the bridge or was it just a similar model?
[4:52:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:52:10] <+AWKWARDL0SER> If Miles stole from the criminals he beat up he‚Äôd have money to help everyone
[4:52:13] <RickyRelucent> probably took you a bit to travel the city, she took a cab
[4:52:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this quest opens a lot of the subplot
[4:52:17] <+chief_chongo> she's mephisto
[4:52:22] <%dds333a> named then?
[4:52:22] <VincentGraves> it's cross gen
[4:52:26] <sriracha_cream> Could it be POSSIBLE that the NPC had the same Jacket, guys>>
[4:52:30] <%dds333a> Kappa
[4:52:37] <kalyxchews> new yorkers can hustle
[4:52:40] <ttgurrenlogan> You did have to grab her up close, so maybe it's just a slightly more polished model
[4:52:42] <Estuko> they're using the Game of Thrones plot travel
[4:52:45] <%cubbywolf> hmmmm
[4:52:48] <deviljhojho_> goddamn inspectors
[4:52:50] <+OddityOn> to be fair she didn't live far from the festival
[4:52:53] <enerkaizer> speaking of which: Miles also made a deal with Mephisto in the comics. but, unlike with peter, his encounter with mephisto and his deal were actually a great story
[4:53:02] <lotharrio> What a bunch of sussy bakas...
[4:53:07] <RickyRelucent> maybd ahe spawned at thf hospital
[4:53:07] <%cubbywolf> God damnit don't remind me of the last season of got

[4:53:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Ganke putting NFTS in Speed Non
[4:53:23] <JacknZack27> Since the game named her ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù I assumed it was supposed to be a different character
[4:53:26] <deviljhojho_> ganke ALREADY made spiderman nfts
[4:53:27] <%Shad0wTag> ISn't there still more to see?
[4:53:31] <deviljhojho_> one of them has his real identity
[4:53:35] <%Shad0wTag> I swear there's few more people to talk to
[4:53:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> had to start over because he built it on the blockchain
[4:53:36] <%emptyantics> Ganke is making his game into a gacha
[4:53:46] <deviljhojho_> he is turning every triangle into a waifu
[4:53:52] <+chief_chongo> @enerkaizer do you remember the writer?
[4:53:59] <IvanMistwalker> saving community homeless centers? looks like a job for Spider-man!
[4:54:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> considering he was going to be ads into the app, he would ABSOLUTELY put Gacha in
[4:54:07] <@Menitta> "Hey miles you should try this mobile game I found! Its called Genshin impact"
[4:54:17] <%cubbywolf> friendly neighborhood spooders
[4:54:18] <enerkaizer> @chief_chongo No, but it happened ina run of "The champions". avergae series overall, but that plot was legit well written

[4:57:23] <QueequegTheater> @cobalt_phoenix_ Don't drink the tap water in the New World Kappa

[5:05:44] <alroy909> his neck is not normal
[5:05:46] <@Menitta> that looks super good
[5:05:48] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus why have Mihn make thumbnails when you can just use the photo mode for this

[5:06:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> technically side, but not really
[5:06:43] <%Shad0wTag> Side Missions are content
[5:06:44] <+OddityOn> @jorniev I'm just waiting for an announcement during the next state of play, idc if it's a teaser I just wanna see Evil Delsin or something
[5:06:48] <%cubbywolf> I think I did almost all the side missions by this point in the game
[5:07:04] <%cubbywolf> obv with a lot more time put in
[5:07:06] <@Menitta> 100%ing this game was satisfying
[5:07:16] <%cubbywolf> nice voice change
[5:07:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> more like sub-plot than Side-Mission, you can tell because they don't have Bonuses
[5:07:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL LUL LUL

[5:08:21] <Dakuu75> uuuhhh...
[5:08:23] <atmos_alt> the Batman vs Superman Bruce had a voice changer
[5:08:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean, Superman makes a mockery of wearing glasses but no one sees Superman, including WITHOUT the Glasses
[5:08:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> froggy
[5:08:27] <+TopTieramisu> pepe and her grandma
[5:08:27] <Dakuu75> ok. (I guess)

[5:08:33] <Dopamien> as dumb as batman vs superman was I did like the robo voice batman had
[5:08:38] <%cubbywolf> you know the murals are actual graffiti artists?
[5:08:38] <tentavision> you've got all that tech and you can't install a voice changer???
[5:08:45] <%strakillias> Could you imagine if Batman just did a NY/Jersey accent instead of the Bale voice.
[5:08:45] <Hammatime8> New suit mod slot!
[5:08:45] <@Menitta> The building art is really nice
[5:08:48] <%cubbywolf> damn libs

[5:09:41] <tentavision> I think he's 17
[5:09:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no skipping Mom on Podcast
[5:09:46] <+golforo> Turning invisible in front of people has unique dialogue too
[5:09:48] <RickyRelucent> when ppl were pushed iff roods
[5:09:55] <%cubbywolf> I think the political writing of this and the last spiderman game are really bad
[5:09:55] <RickyRelucent> off roofs*
[5:09:57] <+OddityOn> he's still in highschool iirc
[5:09:58] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @atmos_alt JOHN MADDEN

[5:10:32] <RickyRelucent> suckas nevah learn!!!
[5:10:34] <+OddityOn> @cubbywolf it's moderately tolerable, definitely more in your face in this game tho
[5:10:35] <HarshNerf> spiderman is always 30 in my headcanon
[5:10:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @plaguedoctor_vi settle down paige
[5:10:38] <enerkaizer> Peter was 16 when he started, and Miles was 14 years old when he became spider-man
[5:10:39] <RickyRelucent> ty!
[5:10:42] <deviljhojho_> its a nice tag too
[5:10:43] <%DensityD> the exaggerated swagger
[5:10:44] <%Theycallmenerf> Jon Madden
[5:10:48] <%KirbyAutomata> Theres a sidequest for that
[5:10:49] <shadepman> 28 year old Peni Parker Kreygasm
[5:10:51] <%KirbyAutomata> I think
[5:10:55] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Miles was 13 and Peter was 15
[5:10:59] <QueequegTheater> @Theycallmenerf BibleThump 7
[5:11:01] <%cubbywolf> dont do auto camo
[5:11:04] <%cubbywolf> thats for babies
[5:11:06] <coreybom> @enerkaizer 15 actually for peter.
[5:11:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> cool
[5:11:13] <%cubbywolf> camo is so strong
[5:11:15] <+OddityOn> The BLM suit and graffiti plus Sony bring Corpos and making a BLM ps4 theme LOL
[5:11:22] <%Theycallmenerf> The exaggerated swagger of a wall crawler
[5:11:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that one's pretty good
[5:11:24] <%cubbywolf> once you start doing it in fights you really unlock some power
[5:11:28] <lotharrio> Creats pickups/drops.
[5:11:37] <enerkaizer> I always remember reading Peter was 16 due to his grade and him graduating highscool so early in the series
[5:11:46] <%cubbywolf> was the spiderman BLM stuff added later?
[5:11:51] <+OddityOn> nope
[5:11:53] <@Menitta> No it was at launch
[5:11:58] <%Shad0wTag> @cubbywolf Nope it as in base game
[5:12:00] <%cubbywolf> didnt the game come out just before BLM?
[5:12:01] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> FFXIVsFreeTrial subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[5:12:02] <%cubbywolf> oh
[5:12:06] <%cubbywolf> time is tough to track
[5:12:15] <QueequegTheater> Time is a flat circle
[5:12:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it was defeinitely at launch since they literally have a QUEST for it
[5:12:18] <+OddityOn> it was during the heat of BLM corpo love
[5:12:19] <%Shad0wTag> @cubbywolf Nope came after but was in development before
[5:12:22] <HarshNerf> would spiderman have acab on his twitter
[5:12:22] <+DatAsuna> god that's ugly
[5:12:24] <coreybom> @cubbywolf nope. Came out after it.
[5:12:25] <@Menitta> It's upon completion of one of the main side contents. I don't remember which
[5:12:25] <+froduck42> Designed by Dave Rapoza
[5:12:28] <+chief_chongo> blm been a movement for a while..
[5:12:30] <%mr_sups> I think that was a Dave Rapoza
[5:12:30] <QueequegTheater> @HarshNerf no
[5:12:31] <+MegaQuint> SHOCKER
[5:12:31] <forumbug74> the worst suit
[5:12:32] <%dds333a> LUL
[5:12:32] <kalyxchews> this looks like an action figure
[5:12:39] <OblivionSword1> that's...something
[5:12:40] <%KirbyAutomata> Looks very 90's or 2000's
[5:12:41] <+OddityOn> This was too much
[5:12:42] <+BackwardCap> Looks like Iron Fist spider
[5:12:43] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus This is the Tokusatsu themed suit as the art designed confirmed it
[5:12:43] <%Theycallmenerf> That looks like a cheap toy
[5:12:44] <lotharrio> Supposed to be based on a Rider.
[5:12:45] <+DakotaMacDoodle> The Rapoza suit
[5:12:45] <QueequegTheater> SHOCKER
[5:12:45] <%Deasmeister> Eww
[5:12:45] <HarshNerf> @queequegtheater cancelled
[5:12:46] <Dakuu75> the "Spider breaker"
[5:12:46] <+froduck42> It was made to look like a Kamen Rider
[5:12:47] <%MightyDuckShoes> SuPiDah Man!
[5:12:47] <%cubbywolf> it looks silly
[5:12:49] <kinkade_77> collar ruins it
[5:12:50] <Daxalog> It looks like a dota skin
[5:12:52] <+OddityOn> Bulky Spiderman suits just never hit
[5:12:53] <@Menitta> That really looks like a toy lmao
[5:12:54] <%cubbywolf> the gloves are the worst
[5:12:56] <+dekkitout> The Shocking Spider-Man
[5:12:59] <+pectusumbra> You can't hide from ME
[5:13:02] <atmos_alt> gold plastic syndrome
[5:13:02] <GHouseduivel> Spiderman cross X-men in the future with Cable, and Bishop
[5:13:04] <DerpioParty> Looks oddly (new) Blue Beetle-esque
[5:13:06] <+BananaSlammuh> Overdesigned
[5:13:06] <+golforo> Only gripe with this game was that I wish there were a few more suits
[5:13:07] <atmos_alt> or was it bronze?
[5:13:09] <FullMetalSnorlax> Spider shocker will chase himself to the ends of the earth!
[5:13:11] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus Heads up the concept artist design that as his Kamen Rider Ichigo tribute
[5:13:12] <RickyRelucent> spiderman went for havels gauntlets
[5:13:22] <RickyRelucent> wheres thd armored spider
[5:13:24] <+OddityOn> @derpioparty thats what I was thinking when I first saw it
[5:13:24] <%cubbywolf> wow
[5:13:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:13:29] <enerkaizer> @DerpioParty which makes sense, consideringh Jaimes design is also very Kamen rider inspired
[5:13:30] <%cubbywolf> imagine flying that high after an upper cut
[5:13:30] <RickyRelucent> the silver one
[5:13:32] <+BackwardCap> He died hard
[5:13:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when you finish a certain quest, it LITERALLY does a camera shot showing hte new suit WITH Black LIves Matter in the background in perfectr frame
[5:13:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FUCKIN DEAD
[5:13:52] <%Juriasu> nice!
[5:13:53] <+pectusumbra> gj!
[5:13:57] <QueequegTheater> You hit that man hard enough to launch him 15 feet in the air, he is DEAD
[5:14:05] <lotharrio> Rip the door off her car.
[5:14:07] <HarshNerf> @shinobiphoenix i saw so many screenshots of that when the game came out, they know
[5:14:10] <%cubbywolf> if you didnt die from the upper cut, you died from falling 8 feet unconcious
[5:14:14] <%Juriasu> what was that light distortion in the middle of the street though
[5:14:28] <+OddityOn> @shinobiphoenix yeah this game never wanted to do subtlety
[5:14:29] <%cubbywolf> unconscious*
[5:14:34] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:14:40] <%cubbywolf> style
[5:14:42] <RickyRelucent> ray tracing
[5:14:45] <fluke_LKZ> Just another day in NY
[5:14:45] <Dakuu75> man, those guys are hardcore
[5:14:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @juriasu thats the pickups from the mod
[5:14:48] <QueequegTheater> Roof people aren't people
[5:14:50] <+BackwardCap> They've seen stranger things
[5:14:51] <Dakuu75> no reaction
[5:15:02] <%cubbywolf> da mural
[5:15:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Miles came out in Nov 2020, it was very much there at launch and I question they adding it in that quickly just because of the riots
[5:15:20] <GHouseduivel> Arkham Asylum faces
[5:15:22] <HarshNerf> spiderman helps with loss protection
[5:15:27] <%cubbywolf> the lip syncing on the non important npc's need work
[5:15:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even if one can say it was jsut a texture edit
[5:15:37] <GHouseduivel> Spiderman enforces castle doctrine.
[5:15:45] <%dds333a> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[5:15:46] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[5:15:46] <Dakuu75> LOL
[5:15:48] <%Juriasu> LUL

[5:16:09] <TheMadDemoknight> So corny I love it
[5:16:14] <+OddityOn> @shinobiphoenix it's just corpo shit, Sony made a whole BLM theme ofc Insomniac wanted to do something now that Miles was a protag
[5:16:20] <%Theycallmenerf> You gotta Daigo parry to get your haircut for free
[5:16:27] <+Based_Moose> there's a barbershop in San Francisco named BladeRunners
[5:16:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> also nice to have a Spiderman who understands SPICE AND FLAVOR
[5:16:35] <%cubbywolf> what food?
[5:16:41] <+pectusumbra> arapas
[5:16:42] <%dds333a> all chicken for me, but my mom makes it all types of ways

[5:16:48] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus My barbers is run by a Jamaican guy and he called it 'Rite Fade' not gonna lie I love that personally especially with the accent

[5:17:13] <%dds333a> @pectusumbra yeah, you mostly had it
[5:17:20] <RickyRelucent> eatinv a slice
[5:17:21] <+BackwardCap> You think Spider-man ever has to use the bathroom right before trouble goes down and he just has to hold it gildedThink
[5:17:27] <QueequegTheater> I miss Chicago pizza puffs
[5:17:38] <HarshNerf> @backwardcap it's canon that he just goes in the suit
[5:17:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I want Jamaican Beef Pies right now... but I live in a very white city...
[5:17:52] <%cubbywolf> nuuuu
[5:17:52] <%Theycallmenerf> Did insomniac state hey guys sorry to making Spider-Man PS4 now into a Tom Holland rip off?
[5:17:58] <%emptyantics> @backwardcap Your body uses the adrenaline to hold it in
[5:17:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> AVOID THE COPS
[5:18:03] <GHouseduivel> Do you know how much I've sacraficed?
[5:18:08] <masterfire23> where is the sanctum Sanctorum in NY
[5:18:10] <%cubbywolf> LUL cmon cutscene
[5:18:15] <%dds333a> You're out norman Kappa
[5:18:17] <%cubbywolf> and turn off right at the end?
[5:18:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @masterfire23 you can in fact Google Maps that
[5:18:27] <+MegaQuint> "Hey, is that thing floating?"
[5:18:31] <GHouseduivel> Chinatown's got something for everybody.
[5:18:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then use that information to find iti n the game, the maps are SUPER accurate
[5:18:44] <%Shad0wTag> @Theycallmenerf Both Insomniac and Yuri himself stated it was due to mocap not matching between Yuri's VA and the face model they were using but I still think its Sony meddling
[5:18:44] <+DatAsuna> @Theycallmenerf nah they said the complaints are silly and that it's meant to look like yuri lowenthal. Even though Yuri is 50, and looks it.
[5:18:49] <+OddityOn> @theycallmenerf I'm pretty sure they told people not to attack the guy they used for the remodel...since people were actually doing that
[5:18:52] <%cubbywolf> HANDS UP
[5:18:56] <%cubbywolf> I WILL SHOOT
[5:18:56] <coreybom> @theycallmenerf No. Don‚Äôt think said anything except that the face was a better fidelity model and closer to yuri.
[5:19:03] <deviljhojho_> WHO'S THERE no1GUN
[5:19:07] <%cubbywolf> Don't shoot! He's not Black!
[5:19:19] <deviljhojho_> hey man its new york
[5:19:26] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:19:27] <+DatAsuna> @coreybom which includes no mention of the hair lol

[5:19:38] <GHouseduivel> Isn't that LAPD?
[5:19:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> Those 6 weeks of training finally paid off
[5:19:45] <+Kyma1020> Shea butter?
[5:19:47] <+Parrish_broadnax> He thought the safety was on
[5:19:56] <%cubbywolf> Kale B
[5:20:01] <HarshNerf> hey wait a minute i smell spices, this isn't spiderman gdolphMonka
[5:20:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Caleb doesn't get a profile shot, but Howard did
[5:20:05] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:20:15] <%dds333a> @kyma1020 a stereotype of black people using it, y'know on their skin, and whatnot
[5:20:19] <@Menitta> Oh yeah I do remember the buildings reflecting off each other looking really good with the ray tracing instead of the fake skyline reflection
[5:20:20] <%cubbywolf> howard is in two games!
[5:20:22] <%emptyantics> @harshnerf LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:20:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @shinobiphoenix Caleb dont got pigeons
[5:20:24] <%dds333a> Just basic skincare LUL
[5:20:30] <+Kyma1020> oh god that's dumb
[5:20:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:20:31] <%cubbywolf> i think howard might be a comic book character too
[5:20:34] <coreybom> @datasuna Funny enough, direct comparisons did look at both models, and Tom Hollandish aside, the new face IS very much better, including the hair funny enough.
[5:20:39] <QueequegTheater> cache-a?
[5:20:42] <@Menitta> These games are really impressive technical showcases honestly
[5:20:44] <+JamOSlam> Cops being able to zero in on the smell of shea butter is horror movie potential
[5:20:47] <%cubbywolf> we kidnapped her to ontop of a sky scrapper
[5:20:52] <%cubbywolf> oh
[5:21:04] <%cubbywolf> that looks cold
[5:21:06] <%andrewofbob> What are these barrel fires doing on the UN building?
[5:21:19] <QueequegTheater> @andrewofbob Seems about right to me Kappa
[5:21:22] <atmos_alt> thats my crib
[5:21:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh, since this will NOT come up in the streams at all, the Stan Lee statue is in Harlem, but the game gets ZERO clues where, but you have to find it for the achievement
[5:21:23] <deviljhojho_> its possible

[5:27:49] <%dds333a> but that's the mixup Kappa
[5:27:49] <%KirbyAutomata> Woolie you watched Don't Look Up, people don't do that apparently?
[5:27:52] <+TopTieramisu> turns out criminals in the big apple have bad necks
[5:27:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> well Spider-Man, Daredevil and Luke Cage
[5:27:59] <QueequegTheater> But then they won't see the Punisher coming
[5:28:01] <+pectusumbra> @WoolieVersus you can't even get regular people to give a crap about normal jobs. you think criminals are smart enough for that?
[5:28:02] <%Juriasu> at least have like one guy be the spider-man lookout guy
[5:28:02] <masterfire23> he could be on any surface tbh
[5:28:02] <OblivionSword1> if gaijin goombah is to be believe people don't tend to look up a lot
[5:28:06] <Pookiedaexzile> You don't look out for the Punisher, you just pray
[5:28:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @deviljhojho_ yo if you have to worry about punisher just stop whatever youre doing
[5:28:15] <deviljhojho_> if i had to be on the lookout for either the punisher or spidey i know which way im looking
[5:28:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Punisher is absolutely looking to snip you
[5:28:21] <%emptyantics> I want a Daredevil game so bad PoroSad
[5:28:21] <The_Maddness> Woolie, if thugs were smar, they wouldnt be operating in Marverl New York
[5:28:29] <wawila> Seeing this games makes me want to play Arkham City again!
[5:28:31] <deviljhojho_> @cobalt_phoenix_ real talk just go back to college and become a family man at that point
[5:28:33] <HarshNerf> you don't see the punisher you just hear gunshots
[5:28:36] <%cubbywolf> imagine looking up all the time and walking into stuff all day
[5:28:40] <+TopTieramisu> @OblivionSword1 real people don't have a spider-man to look out for
[5:28:42] <The_Maddness> Blurgh
[5:28:43] <%KirbyAutomata> @emptyantics It's first person black screen
[5:28:57] <%dds333a> As scary as it would  be to have Spidey after me, I think it would be even scarier to go up against Luke, since he has ONE gameplan
[5:28:57] <Pookiedaexzile> If you see the Punisher you really fucked up
[5:28:57] <fluke_LKZ> If you have to worry about the Punisher, is about time you change career.

[5:29:41] <HarshNerf> @atmos_alt isekai'd by punisher
[5:29:48] <%KirbyAutomata> @emptyantics There is a horror game like that where you use your walking stick to make echolocation happen. can't remember the name
[5:29:55] <%dds333a> @emptyantics no, but he's capable
[5:30:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Luke Cage and Black Punisher need to make a return
[5:30:05] <%dds333a> Luke tries not to
[5:30:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @emptyantics Luke Cage is like fighting minor Hulk, you wish he killed you
[5:30:08] <%cubbywolf> my style was to stealth everyone above floor level and then beat up the rest
[5:30:21] <+dekkitout> @Pookiedaexzile That combination is too jive and you know this
[5:30:23] <+RuruLMF> What kind of absolute moron of a criminal would do his business in a port in Marvel New-York

[5:37:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> he still went off the building tho
[5:37:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Buh da armor tho
[5:37:56] <+TopTieramisu> falling off tall buildings is <not> murder
[5:37:56] <QueequegTheater> Would it be tho
[5:37:58] <%dds333a> Sure Woolie Kappa
[5:37:58] <Hammatime8> No murder allowed!
[5:38:02] <+dekkitout> Because bonking him off the roof wasn't murder
[5:38:10] <%nicversus> Anyone who thinks Danika is cringe is cringe
[5:38:11] <+FuqBoiSlim> he had a parachute on it's FINE
[5:38:11] <+Jake_Protagonist> Ive seen them explode i thought so maybe bug?
[5:38:12] <bleugh> SWAGGER
[5:38:13] <HarshNerf> rocket ammo famously known for not triggering on impac4
[5:38:19] <+Jake_Protagonist> the tricks are rad
[5:38:19] <RickyRelucent> like spiderman is adverse to murder
[5:38:20] <+OddityOn> ay his armor is just conviniently strong
[5:38:20] <KahnWick> I don't trust happy people, Danika sus af
[5:38:27] <%nicversus> Danika would be cringe if she said stuff like "cheugy"
[5:38:28] <QueequegTheater> "Your honor, if you have an S rank combo it's not murder"
[5:38:30] <RickyRelucent> cnon niw :o
[5:38:34] <+RuruLMF> His swinging animations actually change the further you are in the game @WoolieVersus
[5:38:39] <+IxDomxI> not all rockets trigger on impact, some have a distance based fuse before they'll explode
[5:38:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> I like how Woolie avoids running on the glass, out of respect LUL
[5:38:48] <fluke_LKZ> This is a very cold game.
[5:38:52] <%dds333a> slo mo

[5:40:03] <%emptyantics> Bu @pectusumbra they deserve death
[5:40:05] <%cubbywolf> sitting down next to some shlub
[5:40:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus you can force it
[5:40:09] <%dds333a> at least the option is there
[5:40:11] <+IxDomxI> it's not an airburst
[5:40:13] <RayCSmooth> you can still take the train
[5:40:14] <+tekkamanred> There is an option to turn on transport scenes actually
[5:40:14] <%DensityD> another neck snap on the pavement
[5:40:15] <%Kaito_Cam> You can actually turn those on.
[5:40:18] <+Crippl3> @WoolieVersus You can turn those fast travel load screens back on in the options menu, at least in Spider-Man Remastered
[5:40:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> @HarshNerf I think he means delayed arming
[5:40:21] <%KirbyAutomata> it exists on the ps4 version!
[5:40:21] <+IxDomxI> it literally doesnt explode if it doesnt travel far enough
[5:40:22] <arkv01> micronap plagueBed
[5:40:23] <deviljhojho_> holy shit its SAM
[5:40:24] <JacknZack27> You have to turn that on in the settings
[5:40:27] <%CoffeeSlice> SAM
[5:40:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus the option to see see the Subway loading is in the Settings menu
[5:40:42] <%elderpunch> that was when u took the fast track subway too
[5:40:43] <The_Maddness> this is next level scummy
[5:40:45] <lotharrio> Someone's from JERSEY!
[5:40:47] <%cubbywolf> I think you can also go to the subway entrence and quicktravel and it'll show you but i might be making that up idr
[5:40:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> Darre I say even an....IMPOSTER?!
[5:40:55] <GHouseduivel> Or just tell us what the plates are.
[5:40:55] <QueequegTheater> S U S
[5:40:57] <%Kaito_Cam> You can turn the transitions for loading screens on in the settings.

[5:41:19] <%dds333a> It loads instantly so yeah
[5:41:31] <%emptyantics> PS5 0 loading
[5:41:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> They wanna show off that PS5 loading. I get it. it's nice to have the option at all

[5:46:31] <PizzicatoFive5> immersive mode
[5:46:35] <Make_me_mad> @WoolieVersus Prompts are appearing in the bottom left for some reason.
[5:46:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> a simple save and reload should work

[5:48:49] <RickyRelucent> swing mechanics were always the selling point if these, i still remember landing on a lightpole or a traffic light on the first ir srcond ps2 games

[5:49:12] <+ScottishMadJacko> Stuff labelled side quests is important, the token stuff is passable mostly
[5:49:16] <%Shad0wTag> @woolieversus collectables audio can replayed on the menu, blue triangle side missions are content
[5:49:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the time capsules and boxes iirc dont have anything special
[5:49:41] <+OddityOn> the training missions have Peter monologues
[5:49:43] <Pistofficer> did anyone else get the mature content warning when jumping in the stream?
[5:49:45] <JacknZack27> You can do the clean up off screen fine
[5:49:46] <Hammatime8> Collectibles are kind of "eh" as far as LP content goes I'd say
[5:49:48] <%Shad0wTag> podcasts audio can be replayed on the main menu
[5:49:50] <Zebroneath> At least the podcasts are saved
[5:49:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can replay Podcast and the Collectable Audio
[5:50:00] <%RyTYoung> @oddityon Oh they monologues are great
[5:50:01] <lotharrio> You could also just take note of the good/interesting podcasts.

[5:53:16] <Hammatime8> And now Insomniac's making a wolverine game too
[5:53:21] <+OddityOn> Insomniac mastered the Spiderman gameplay
[5:53:21] <@Menitta> both these and Ratchet
[5:53:27] <RickyRelucent> insomniac did not hecome nauhhtydog
[5:53:37] <RickyRelucent> it is....acceptable
[5:53:46] <%legacy0117> ‚Äò‚ÄòTwas a good watch.
[5:53:52] <+DatAsuna> shame the dlc stories sucked
[5:53:55] <+OddityOn> We can only hope Wolverine is just as good
[5:53:55] <%Shad0wTag> I wish Sony didn't buy them so we could seem them do other stuff outside exclusives
[5:53:59] <RickyRelucent> where the bew jak game
[5:54:02] <+pectusumbra> great stream once again! And now get the night to catch up on other streams
[5:54:04] <MindlessMonks> we good boss, that was good
[5:54:04] <tentavision> good
[5:54:05] <+chadcialist> Spider-Man cool
[5:54:11] <%dds333a> music Kappa
[5:54:12] <+DatAsuna> yeah all that music
[5:54:13] <%nicversus> great stream guys
[5:54:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Shad0wTag not luck, you can replicate it. it's at the beginning of the game, you use the tokens to unlock suits before the game TELLS you when you can and then you don't have the tokens, you can't continue the prompts and you're just stuck
[5:54:16] <reallytall_guy> great
[5:54:17] <+MrParamedic> this is my favourite of the 2 spider-man's
[5:54:20] <Hammatime8> @RickyRelucent Man, I still like Naughty Dog's games, but they treat their workers like garbage and that's not cool
[5:54:20] <TheAntiNihilist> uncontroversial.  Insomniac>Naughty Dog
[5:54:25] <+sekri0> Did Woolie Notice that when Peter tells Miles that he's in charge, Miles" name changes to Spider-Man in the Subtitles?
[5:54:34] <RickyRelucent> new* i enjoyed deadlocjed and jak x
[5:54:47] <+Jiggisnipe> @sekri0 he pointed it out I think
[5:55:09] <+sekri0> @Jiggisnipe Oop wwasnt here for that
[5:55:20] <NordiqueJer> Is everyone ready to watch the guys play with the mildly outdated swagger of middle aged men?
[5:55:35] <%dds333a> and he has your kit
[5:55:37] <lotharrio> The Taskmaster fights were great.
[5:55:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the 100 hit combo Achievement is a bit annoying
[5:55:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
