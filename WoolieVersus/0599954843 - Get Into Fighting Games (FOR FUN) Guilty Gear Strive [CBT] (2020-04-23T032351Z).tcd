[0:19:31] <%Prevot> needs to be DIRTY
[0:19:31] <%doombawkzvs> Needs more spikes
[0:19:32] <+Jttg> Put "Feat. Woolie" in the title
[0:19:33] <nepwar> the title looks like something from automata
[0:19:33] <%Solidnick18> The FILTH
[0:19:41] <LocoCrazy_> There needs to be way more metal.
[0:19:41] <+TechnicolorNinja> The battle damage
[0:19:42] <Mach5Mike> Needs more METAL
[0:19:42] <DaKnightWarrior> The lobby is so bad.
[0:19:42] <Zayasu> imagine persona had a simplistic ui like this WutFace
[0:19:42] <floralkami> too cozy!
[0:19:45] <SkreamnRedSkull> @WoolieVersus saw how clean it was and said "Damn girl, you live like this?"
[0:19:46] <%andrei11dr> Fafnier damage is really high right now
[0:19:49] <DaBigVitus> it's more instrumental atmospheric than metal right now
[0:19:53] <LocoCrazy_> It's not bullshit blazing enough
[0:19:55] <knackirontarkus> I like the floor names being classic metal songs
[0:19:59] <%Livelinne> Oh no my battery BibleThump
[0:20:00] <+ggbhtg> IS THIS A JOJOS???????
[0:20:04] <Daba_mk2> Cool
[0:20:06] <%Mitral_> i like the new UI but theyre prob gonna SCUNGE it up in the next build, cause they said there IS GONNA be Instant Kills, theyre just not in yet, same with Dragon Install too i think

[0:25:23] <%Mitral_> they may change it to a cabinet
[0:25:26] <%Prevot> I hate the look of this lobby
[0:25:27] <DaHaLoJeDi> 6 FEET
[0:25:27] <%Solidnick18> wow
[0:25:27] <+Hollow_Mirage> I mean yeah he was a Psycho... but he had moments were he was all jokey and stuff but now he is just... Jason vorheez
[0:25:28] <woodstock_hobbs> server social distancing
[0:25:32] <%gatorafan> That's dumb
[0:25:37] <+croxeye> why would they remove the cabinets from the lobbys?
[0:25:39] <DaBigVitus> why does japan have to japanify things for the worse
[0:25:41] <KRaZyAmmo> Woolie playing Ky?
[0:25:43] <%nothuzad> Hollow_Mirage nah theres pretty jokey stuff sitll in there
[0:25:45] <Nillard> Bring back the PS3/360 era lobbies of just being a damn menu
[0:25:49] <%Solidnick18> this is pretty rough
[0:25:54] <KRaZyAmmo> huh....woulda thought he'd go Potemkin
[0:25:56] <%andrei11dr> And that's why we need to DESTROY SOCIETY
[0:25:56] <%doombawkzvs> I'm pretty sure it's pronounced "threats" as in "threatening"
[0:25:58] <skellisquid> The cabinets were more cosy feeling
[0:25:58] <TopTierHarley> arcade setup is bad too
[0:25:58] <+eanscrale> The wanted posters are nice, but beyond that
[0:26:03] <%doombawkzvs> "therats"
[0:26:03] <Doublemint_Dave_> Damn I don’t think I can get in woolie’s lobby...
[0:26:04] <Zayasu> i would just prefer menus tbh LUL
[0:26:04] <%doombawkzvs> lol
[0:26:06] <%Mitral_> as long as good feedbacks given, they'll probably change it like how the UI changed the first time
[0:26:07] <%mrlastchance1> SOCIETYYY
[0:26:07] <%ECRead> I play Pot. feels badman
[0:26:08] <DaHaLoJeDi> Woolie playing Ky and Pat playing Sol is a canon matchup
[0:26:15] <DaKnightWarrior> The lobby music is really boring aswell.
[0:26:19] <%Solidnick18> old lobby was fine
[0:26:20] <+Hollow_Mirage> But can He still do a 1000 years of death?
[0:26:24] <DaHaLoJeDi> TOOK TOO LONG
[0:26:30] <DaHaLoJeDi> now your chance is gone
[0:26:34] <DaHaLoJeDi> that's what happen
[0:26:35] <snakesonabane> gamers knew that they cannot change society
[0:26:36] <DagumiGoodman> 👀
[0:26:37] <Vortigon> It's the TFH problem
[0:26:40] <%bokutachi_san> the News thing is also wack
[0:26:47] <%Wool> it's the same Chipp
[0:26:48] <%Struggleful> So is there a way to like form a line for next up?
[0:26:49] <%andrei11dr> I won't lie, this lobby is wack
[0:26:51] <%nothuzad> the news thing is way too big
[0:26:51] <Axle13j> I'm in the lobby but don't see any of the people on this screen LUL
[0:26:54] <%doombawkzvs> ...
[0:26:56] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:26:56] <%Wool> why is Woolie pronouncing Threats like that
[0:26:57] <usurper_sos> ....
[0:26:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> And it seems that the character models at least are still 3D but with flat shading, so it should be easier to transfer? maybe?
[0:26:59] <%bokutachi_san> jermaChomp
[0:27:00] <+Naniko> Woolie it says Threats lol
[0:27:00] <%optimasmaximas> ....
[0:27:00] <%aka_Jigawatt> ...
[0:27:04] <%gatorafan> Excet that in TFH you have an extra axis to avoid crowding.
[0:27:04] <%Solidnick18> um
[0:27:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> LMAOOOOOOO
[0:27:04] <+ElectricFoxLex> Maybe we should go to another region

[0:27:11] <%Solidnick18> oh booooooooy
[0:27:12] <Revzero25> I played earlier and the connections were not good
[0:27:13] <Kyanta_Rojo> So uhh what floor is Woolie on, What Region.
[0:27:17] <+eanscrale> 10/10 netcode guys
[0:27:18] <+Suneater_Jerome> enjoying the lobby music lads?
[0:27:18] <Axle13j> Yea it takes a bit for the screen to appear for the other player
[0:27:20] <%andrei11dr> DAFZ Problems woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:27:20] <+williss_> just have a player list ffs
[0:27:20] <%doombawkzvs> The rats!
[0:27:20] <snakesonabane> rats rats we're the rats
[0:27:21] <usurper_sos> LUL the rats
[0:27:21] <Onjani> true cbt
[0:27:22] <%jiggy_snipe> hype gameplay right here
[0:27:25] <%Mitral_> what does he get in trickster tho
[0:27:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sasuga, Arcysys-kun
[0:27:29] <Kalcom> rats rats
[0:27:32] <+SpoopySkeletman> @snakesonabane I love that video
[0:27:32] <%Wool> You should move up a floor so I can join in BibleThump
[0:27:33] <%doombawkzvs> the rats
[0:27:34] <%optimasmaximas> lul
[0:27:34] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:27:36] <KRaZyAmmo> truly this is the best Strive gameplay
[0:27:37] <DaHaLoJeDi> @BlipJaw Jebaited
[0:27:40] <Kyanta_Rojo> It is a closed beta so It makes sense it has issues
[0:27:42] <Kalcom> we're the rats
[0:27:42] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus So the lobby is really dumb. if you want to challenge someone directly, you need to put your sword AWAY, and then talk to someone with it out to challenge them. If you leave your sword out, you will challenge literally anyone who passes by you who has their sword out
[0:27:43] <Axle13j> I've been playing with a friend for a while now and there's been mean delays even when we were in the same lobby together
[0:27:45] <wangan> Lobbies are instanced btw so if you join the same, they’ll still be different
[0:27:49] <Kyanta_Rojo> DBZF closed beta was bad too
[0:27:50] <%gatorafan> So, is this woolieFUN or woolieGLORY ? Kappa
[0:27:54] <%Livelinne> woolieSHOOK woolieVS clempsMischief
[0:27:56] <BlipJaw> largemNice
[0:27:57] <Kyanta_Rojo> Granblue surprisingly good though
[0:28:04] <+thecraye> So, is the game accesssible if i just work on my fundamentals?
[0:28:06] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp is it happening?!
[0:28:08] <Kyanta_Rojo> Yes
[0:28:12] <%Struggleful> Amazing
[0:28:17] <%Wool> you just have to wait
[0:28:18] <+ElectricFoxLex> He has to be unarmed to challenge you
[0:28:20] <DaHaLoJeDi> this is so weird
[0:28:21] <%jiggy_snipe> Solidus plz
[0:28:22] <+croxeye> wow this is brutal
[0:28:25] <+RichHoboInVegas> this is wack
[0:28:25] <%Irridium> he in lobby six right
[0:28:26] <usurper_sos> This game is fucking broken
[0:28:29] <Blank9> this is terrible
[0:28:31] <0cash> this is unclear
[0:28:37] <%jiggy_snipe> oh god this is awful lol
[0:28:37] <@Solidus_113> it's an awful system
[0:28:39] <SpookyBeef7> Yeah, I tried this earlier today and last night. It's not great.
[0:28:40] <DaHaLoJeDi> PLEASE JUST GIVE US CABINETS
[0:28:40] <%Jetzord> I'm so confused
[0:28:42] <Vortigon> Actual CBT
[0:28:45] <+TeethMuncher> Maybe it's for the best this doesn't have a twitch category
[0:28:46] <%Wool> Change Floors
[0:28:46] <+Hollow_Mirage> This Lobby System is not good
[0:28:47] <NickHatesSnow> This is a weird lobby
[0:28:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> EDGE
[0:28:51] <+croxeye> Just WHY?
[0:28:51] <%Prevot> going great so far
[0:28:52] <KRaZyAmmo> ouch this ain't great
[0:28:54] <KRaZyAmmo> EDGE
[0:28:54] <blightblues> why did they think this was a good lobby system??
[0:28:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> we live?
[0:28:58] <Kyanta_Rojo> @thecraye This game hasn't developed it's meta yet. You will be able to make it work with fundamentals for now but eventually you will need to learn anti-air and counter hit juggle combos
[0:28:58] <%OkNow_64> god the lobbies needed their own beta before this beta
[0:29:00] <%NecDW4> @WoolieVersus you can challenge directly if you put your weapon away
[0:29:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WHAT A GOOD LOBBY
[0:29:01] <%optimasmaximas> i hate that that message goes away
[0:29:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> ye we live
[0:29:01] <%andrei11dr> DBFZ all over again :(
[0:29:02] <skellisquid> That's not very metal of you bro
[0:29:04] <%nothuzad> you just have to repeat
[0:29:04] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[0:29:05] <snakesonabane> imagine spending insane amounts of cash on the beautiful graphics then greenlighting this lobby
[0:29:07] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:29:07] <%jiggy_snipe> truly the CBT
[0:29:08] <%doombawkzvs> lol
[0:29:09] <thatjuantoo> NEGATIVE PENALTY!
[0:29:14] <%doombawkzvs> Gets code, can't play
[0:29:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh fuck there is a huge line
[0:29:14] <%Jetzord> Cool in concept, awful execution
[0:29:14] <SuperFightinRobot> Chandelier dude on the right just took a hit for 50% life.
[0:29:15] <LokimenD> *Groose's Theme Intensifies*
[0:29:16] <gmbt21xd> W/L Record: 2-11
[0:29:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> This is the edging part of the CBT huh
[0:29:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> sup crew
[0:29:23] <usurper_sos> It's not working because it is bad
[0:29:24] <DaHaLoJeDi> Well I guess that's what the Beta is for I guess
[0:29:24] <%Thunderhog> So the lobby is really dumb. if you want to challenge someone directly, you need to put your sword AWAY, and then talk to someone with it out to challenge them. If you leave your sword out, you will challenge literally anyone who passes by you who has their sword out
[0:29:25] <%yeknomlive> i think that is a proper judgement
[0:29:26] <%jiggy_snipe> Granblue is great
[0:29:28] <%Prevot> I think it's bad AND doesn't work
[0:29:30] <%yeknomlive> doesnt work? fuck it
[0:29:33] <%big_oki> gods of rollback
[0:29:38] <+TeethMuncher> Cabinets and arcades are dead
[0:29:39] <%SirGO0SE> granblue fighting game of the year
[0:29:46] <%Jetzord> @CaptainPileDriver hey Cap, you're just in time to see the lobby fuckery
[0:29:49] <%andrei11dr> But it looks like shit, and it seems to work like shit
[0:29:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol
[0:29:56] <snakesonabane> getting a match in the lobby is the true fighting game
[0:30:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm logging on right now to see if i can get somehow
[0:30:05] <sendart> this lobby is shit
[0:30:06] <DaHaLoJeDi> why the fuck is this so goddamn obtuse
[0:30:09] <Kyanta_Rojo> @SirGO0SE They wanted to try something different since DBZF and Granblue have fairly similar systems to Xrd
[0:30:10] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[0:30:11] <%TubeMan642> what lobby are they in I wanna fight woolie
[0:30:13] <+jepupu> Might be woolies connection if it’s failing with everyone else
[0:30:14] <%bokutachi_san> the tech PogChamp
[0:30:15] <+croxeye> that's DUMB
[0:30:16] <@Solidus_113> That's what I was doing
[0:30:17] <0cash> lets go
[0:30:19] <gmbt21xd> I love the charm tho
[0:30:19] <LokimenD> PogChamp
[0:30:19] <%Thunderhog> It's really dumb
[0:30:20] <%doombawkzvs> Thunderhog with the tech
[0:30:21] <snakesonabane> LOBBY DEFEATED
[0:30:22] <Axle13j> Get that person a medal
[0:30:22] <usurper_sos> That is really dumb
[0:30:22] <Vortigon> Did solidus did the right thing? was it woolie's fault?
[0:30:26] <HorseGum> discord tech PogChamp
[0:30:26] <DaHaLoJeDi> THIS IS DUMB
[0:30:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:30:27] <%andrei11dr> Oh God why would it be that hard LUL
[0:30:29] <+eanscrale> 10/10 lobby guys
[0:30:31] <%Irridium> he's on floor six right
[0:30:33] <GroundControl138> who thought this lobby was a good idea? LUL
[0:30:36] <Zayasu> D:
[0:30:36] <%Jetzord> Why would you put your weapon away to start a fight?
[0:30:37] <snakesonabane> BOOO
[0:30:37] <woodstock_hobbs> that is a cool idea for a lobby
[0:30:37] <DaHaLoJeDi> OOOOOOOOOOH
[0:30:37] <Axle13j> WOW
[0:30:39] <+Nahkc> wtf LUL
[0:30:39] <@Solidus_113> WHO SKIPPIN INTROS
[0:30:40] <%Prevot> they need to just scrap this whole system
[0:30:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BOOOOOO
[0:30:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> Thanks arcsys
[0:30:45] <%gatorafan> BOOOOO
[0:30:47] <+Roivas1991> Yeah, ASW's lobbies need to be reworked again.
[0:30:49] <+LTKonnor> Faust looks amazing
[0:30:50] <%zeroarturia> BOOOO THAT MAN
[0:30:52] <ElPlasa> MANKIND KNEW
[0:30:57] <Blank9> it's not a cool idea for a lobby, it looks awful and is actively a step down from their usual
[0:31:01] <TigerClaws12> woolie is a dirty Ky player? DansGame
[0:31:06] <DaHaLoJeDi> that was like 15 seconds
[0:31:09] <%nothuzad> the risc gauge is also a bit bigger but sitll needs to be bigger
[0:31:09] <+Hollow_Mirage> I love Ky’s new Sword
[0:31:09] <SuperFightinRobot> Faust being evil again.
[0:31:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> so what lobby?
[0:31:10] <LokimenD> Look at Woolie go monkaS
[0:31:12] <%Thunderhog> @Jetzord Really it's the dumbest thing
[0:31:13] <%yeknomlive> man faust's 2s is the most overtop animation ive seen. it's pretty sick
[0:31:16] <%steelmorrigan> Is ths rollback?
[0:31:16] <Blank9> woolie is repping his true main's dad
[0:31:17] <BluBox> Eh, not really
[0:31:18] <0cash> god its so pretty. (though the UI is too clean)
[0:31:21] <Blank9> no, delay
[0:31:22] <+croxeye> i would rather have the portrait maintain it's position
[0:31:23] <+TeethMuncher> Sliding portraits is distracting
[0:31:23] <%yeknomlive> no rollback
[0:31:25] <DaBigVitus> sliding portrait looks wack to me
[0:31:25] <HorseGum> no, this is still delay netcode
[0:31:26] <%steelmorrigan> I don't see frame delay data
[0:31:26] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> absolutely no one didnt understand life bars
[0:31:27] <LocoCrazy_> BULLSHIT BLAZING! \m/,
[0:31:28] <DaHaLoJeDi> THAT IS BULLSHIT

[0:31:41] <DaKnightWarrior> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:31:41] <+Goku01899> In the next Acrsys game they will force you to play chess before entering the lobby matches Kappa

[0:32:06] <+CounterBeard> My boy looks as whack as always. I love it

[0:32:13] <VJdarkworld> S O C I E T Y
[0:32:14] <%yeknomlive> i love that they gave him garudyne from persona
[0:32:16] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver I think 6 but I haven't seen him yet
[0:32:19] <0cash> so why is faust silent now
[0:32:24] <Iwashi94> I really wish Chipp wasn't built like goddamn Schwarzenegger in this game
[0:32:24] <SuperFightinRobot> I love new faust
[0:32:26] <+LTKonnor> OH GOD
[0:32:26] <%Jetzord> So, when are we going to see Octopimp in the lobby?
[0:32:27] <SpookyBeef7> They actually changed Faust so much I feel like I have to learn him all over again.
[0:32:31] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:32:38] <snakesonabane> delay based netcode PogChamp
[0:32:40] <+GeneralHysterics> wake up super pog
[0:32:43] <%nothuzad> 0cash gaust is sitll somewhat unfinished - he doesnt ahve a second super and voice clips arent in there either
[0:32:44] <+croxeye> this game looks so good, why does the UI and the lobby system got to be so bad?
[0:32:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Rollback save us! It's not in but still, save us
[0:32:54] <%andrei11dr> I wonder if the dood knows about the scarecrow teleport
[0:32:55] <Iwashi94> bitrate going crazy lol
[0:32:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> 9
[0:33:05] <KRaZyAmmo> THAT BULLSHIT IS BLAZING!
[0:33:16] <DaHaLoJeDi> neat
[0:33:19] <Axle13j> that was hype lol
[0:33:20] <LokimenD> Look at Woolie laming it out
[0:33:25] <+LTKonnor> Those projectiles are bullshit blazing
[0:33:27] <0cash> @nothuzad Ah i see, i thought they were going to change his character. Thanks!
[0:33:33] <rolothakid> Slllllash
[0:33:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus where i go to fight you
[0:33:39] <DaKnightWarrior> SHOCK STATE
[0:33:40] <Vortigon> BRING BACK BRIDGET!
[0:33:43] <woodstock_hobbs> 3d element anime vic. that stuff looks smooth
[0:33:47] <SpookyBeef7> Gatling is VERY different.
[0:33:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> No Testament no Investament
[0:33:57] <DaHaLoJeDi> where's Slayer though
[0:33:58] <SpookyBeef7> All of my old Faust combos are no longer valid.
[0:33:58] <+TeethMuncher> Just let me mash
[0:33:58] <alephalpha> gatlings easy
[0:34:08] <KRaZyAmmo> Ky mirror
[0:34:08] <SerAmeros> I don't know what to do. ; - ;
[0:34:09] <Vortigon> @FuqBoiSlim damn, that ones good
[0:34:16] <donstylo> I hope they bring Anji and Testament back.
[0:34:17] <%andrei11dr> Dose jab into jab work?
[0:34:18] <@Solidus_113> traditional gatling only exists when you hit the counter dust
[0:34:19] <DaHaLoJeDi> NO BAIKEN NO BUYKEN
[0:34:22] <MechaBaphomet> This game feels harder being more restricted
[0:34:24] <%nothuzad> I think not andrei11dr
[0:34:30] <alephalpha> it algatlings also just feel good
[0:34:38] <%Irridium> god I hate this lobby system so much
[0:34:40] <BluBox> The old way was better because going from low to high makes way more sense than restricting routes here and there
[0:34:40] <BigNerdSam> May is bay
[0:34:41] <SerAmeros> As a beginner all I'm doing is getting my cheeks clapped and not sure where do look up things to do. ;-;
[0:34:43] <%Irridium> why can't I see woolie
[0:34:52] <%bokutachi_san> Ky AI taught me to always DP 3 times
[0:34:55] <%andrei11dr> So jabbing is only for staggering now
[0:35:04] <%Wool> YES I DERANKED
[0:35:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo chat, which online lobby we in?
[0:35:27] <alephalpha> jabs can link into stuff
[0:35:28] <+TeethMuncher> Reggie, that isn't intuitive at all
[0:35:30] <Jrocy247> All I'm hearing is Slash....
[0:35:37] <alephalpha> but like why not just keep the gatlings
[0:35:38] <%nothuzad> andrei11dr although it just looked like tis possible so might have changed V:
[0:35:41] <%Thunderhog> Easy coast usa 6
[0:35:45] <DaBigVitus> how is that easier for noobs?
[0:35:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> thanks @thunderhog
[0:35:50] <Suwaiya> very intuitive combo btw
[0:36:04] <alephalpha> sounds like bbtag nu combos bbbbbbbbbb
[0:36:06] <BluBox> P>K>S>HS was way more intuitive
[0:36:10] <%zeroarturia> @Wool Never thought that will be a good thing in this beta LUL
[0:36:11] <%Thunderhog> @CaptainPileDriver Just hope you get into the same actual room. same floors have multiple layers of lobbies
[0:36:14] <alephalpha> I miss gatlings
[0:36:18] <%nothuzad> ye the normal gatling is way more intuitive
[0:36:19] <Shraquet> Is the beta good now?
[0:36:29] <%skylerpilot> May can C.S into 5P
[0:36:30] <Jrocy247> Now Reggie. Speak that in English for Noobs who can understand
[0:36:31] <alephalpha> nah lobbies are still messed up
[0:36:33] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> how do you do the drift rc
[0:36:33] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus Reggie, I play Potemkin. My combo is basically shoulder ram, flick, and grabbing you for 60% of your health bar.
[0:36:33] <%Thunderhog> This lobby system is really dumb
[0:36:34] <%yeknomlive> you can do 2s sweeps and stuff too
[0:36:41] <SerAmeros> I have no idea what to do
[0:36:45] <DaHaLoJeDi> Ky's timbs are disgusting
[0:36:46] <gmbt21xd> Is it just me or the lobbies are instanced?
[0:36:52] <%doombawkzvs> I'm not following any of this
[0:36:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> i can tell this is a dumb lobby system
[0:36:59] <%nothuzad> Jrocy247 gatling just means that you go from weakest to strongest button and it combos into each other - this doesnt work like that anymore
[0:37:05] <%Wool> Can you go up a few floors later? Some of us are too high ranked to join lol
[0:37:07] <%andrei11dr> Oh boy, Testament would be crazy in this game
[0:37:08] <Blank9> grab damage is STUPID in this
[0:37:09] <woodstock_hobbs> i love that animation
[0:37:10] <DaBigVitus> looks like a nintendo UI
[0:37:16] <alephalpha> reggie I play xrd rev 2 all the time it' still impossible to follow what you're saying
[0:37:22] <alephalpha> you're speaking too fast
[0:37:26] <alephalpha> aand the words blur together
[0:37:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[0:37:26] <+TeethMuncher> @WoolieVersus you've lost me Reggie.
[0:37:35] <Blank9> landing a grab feels like a p5a full super meter autocombo
[0:37:37] <gmbt21xd> Yeah i just realized it
[0:37:39] <Blank9> a regular grab
[0:37:44] <%xpakeo> woolieMINHSTINCT my brain on reggie
[0:37:44] <woodstock_hobbs> anyone know of any keyboard fighting games ?
[0:37:48] <+Reverend_Roscoe> That fucking EVA nerd
[0:37:49] <gmbt21xd> Each lobby was seperately instanced instead of single lobby
[0:37:49] <+Kamennoo> @gmbt21xd type that again....???
[0:37:54] <Doublemint_Dave_> My rank changed and it took me out of the lobby are you serious...
[0:37:55] <ElPlasa> LETS GO SOLIDUS
[0:37:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Vortigon
[0:38:05] <%djazo> the grab god
[0:38:05] <+Afro_Ninja_22> I got it
[0:38:06] <gmbt21xd> Basically they seperated a single lobby into 3 @Kamennoo
[0:38:07] <%andrei11dr> I understand
[0:38:10] <%yeknomlive> reggie was right btw
[0:38:10] <ZeeJiggle> You had me at "Hello"
[0:38:14] <SerAmeros> Bro as a beginner I'm not ever sure what to do.
[0:38:15] <P0wderedT0astMan> I mean it made sense
[0:38:15] <%yeknomlive> people were asking so reggie's in the right
[0:38:15] <%doombawkzvs> Who needs combos when you can Potemkin buster someone for 85% :P
[0:38:15] <%Irridium> I can't even get into the same room BibleThump
[0:38:16] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, keep monologuing to yourself.
[0:38:17] <%nothuzad> the problem is not teh info its the speed :)
[0:38:18] <%Wool> I got demoted but I'm still too high ranked lmao
[0:38:19] <BlipJaw> i pretty much understood it
[0:38:20] <gmbt21xd> That way a server can't be bloated
[0:38:21] <SerAmeros> the game tells you like nothing.
[0:38:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'M COMMING FOR YOU WOOLIE
[0:38:21] <%xpakeo> we still love you Mr. Reginald
[0:38:23] <alephalpha> reggie what i want to hear is what you know about fdc in this game
[0:38:23] <+Kamennoo> @gmbt21xd no, i asked you to type that again i didnt understand what you just asked at all
[0:38:24] <+GeneralHysterics> THE B E A S T S
[0:38:30] <xdeathknightx> Reggie is explaining for people who want to get into fighting games ;)
[0:38:31] <slamview> I appreciated it reggie, bc I'll come back to dissect what you said when I can actually play the game
[0:38:31] <%doombawkzvs> THE BOY
[0:38:33] <ElPlasa> But they found beauty even in the lives of beasts
[0:38:35] <woodstock_hobbs> i was thinking of an a/b back forward/ combo d-pad combo system would be a fun game
[0:38:36] <DaHaLoJeDi> POT LOOKS SO FUCKIN COOL
[0:38:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GO POTEMKIN!!!!!
[0:38:40] <%andrei11dr> Also i already heard how this game works from Max
[0:38:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS FUCKING GOOOO
[0:38:44] <alephalpha> :reggie what i want to hear is what you know about fdc in this game
[0:38:45] <+Deko_> C O U N T E R
[0:38:48] <DaHaLoJeDi> *immediately gets blown up*
[0:38:50] <SkreamnRedSkull> So instead of reflecting of themselves, they reflected on Woolie's face
[0:38:50] <Jrocy247> Says Woolie as he is put in place
[0:38:52] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Yo, Potemkin looks beast
[0:38:53] <BluBox> Put who in who's place?
[0:38:59] <%yeknomlive> have you seen the crazy shit pot has in this game? he can combo off of a buster in the corner
[0:39:00] <Iwashi94> octopimp flashbacks
[0:39:03] <+Reverend_Roscoe> IS THAT A REVOLVER ON HIS WRISTS?
[0:39:03] <SpookyBeef7> Octopimp got in a Potemkin mirror last night and it was all "WHAT EVEN IS SCREEN SPACE?"
[0:39:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> BIG damage boye
[0:39:06] <%mrlastchance1> Solidus goin iiiiiinnnn
[0:39:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Put them in their place" LUL
[0:39:25] <ElPlasa> WAIT HE HAS AN AEGIS REFLECTOR?
[0:39:26] <SerAmeros> I'm so lost tbh.
[0:39:27] <Iwashi94> THAT IS BULLSHIT BLAZING
[0:39:31] <InfinityCircuit> Honorable Pot, doesn't grab for nothing
[0:39:33] <gmbt21xd> @Kamennoo I'm in the beta rn, and going to Woolie's lobby i entered to an empty lobby, i joined again to a lobby with other people. In other words to prevent what happened yesterday the seperate lobbies in a server are instanced.
[0:39:33] <slamview> POG
[0:39:33] <Pannkko> "shock state"
[0:39:35] <KRaZyAmmo> THAT IS BULLSHIT BLAZING
[0:39:36] <%mrlastchance1> Do they not have the other songs in the beta?
[0:39:36] <alephalpha> reggie what I want to hear is what you know about fdc in this game
[0:39:37] <%andrei11dr> Oh ,they chanced Pots charge
[0:39:39] <%Livelinne> woolieSHOOK
[0:39:40] <KRaZyAmmo> Shock state
[0:39:40] <%aka_Jigawatt> S H O C K S T A T E
[0:39:43] <%bigmacjack12> THAT IS BULLSHIT
[0:39:51] <gmbt21xd> I was mostly asking myself.
[0:39:53] <woodstock_hobbs> robot arm smash!
[0:39:53] <%skylerpilot> @gmbt21xd they were like that yesterday as well
[0:39:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> I think I'm gonna main Potemkin...
[0:39:58] <clamlamity> Just arrived, what's the first impressions on the game so far?
[0:39:58] <Zannablu_ke> i need to see that 50% command grab
[0:40:00] <BurdRightsActivist> DOKAPON KING- cbt ResidentSleeper
[0:40:11] <SerAmeros> what does dust do?
[0:40:12] <%gatorafan> COUN daedra1DrunkTibs TER
[0:40:17] <Iwashi94> How viable is Guilty Gear with a regular controller?
[0:40:17] <Mach5Mike> Nice!
[0:40:23] <gmbt21xd> @skylerpilot ahhhh okay, though i managed to get 2 matches before crashing
[0:40:26] <+croxeye> DAMN
[0:40:30] <%nintega010> Dokapon is tonight isn't it?
[0:40:30] <alephalpha> : reggie what i want to hear is what you know about fdc in this game
[0:40:30] <%nothuzad> igliak dust launches people in the air on counter hit - where you can freestyle combo
[0:40:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> so we in eastcoast floor 6??
[0:40:32] <mr_sups> Best thing to come out of this beta is the Full Themes
[0:40:32] <+croxeye> that was a sweet match
[0:40:33] <SpookyBeef7> @Iwashi94 Pretty viable.
[0:40:33] <DaHaLoJeDi> put in place LUL
[0:40:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> yes the ui is kinda ass but I kinda like the counter in the background
[0:40:35] <+Kamennoo> @gmbt21xd well i appreciate understandable sentences that time SeemsGood
[0:40:36] <@Solidus_113> whew
[0:40:38] <+thecraye> fucking hell
[0:40:39] <%Livelinne> HSWP woolieFABRICATION
[0:40:40] <%yeknomlive> overhead, and has a follow up but i think only on counter hit in this one
[0:40:46] <gmbt21xd> @Kamennoo sorry!
[0:40:46] <%skylerpilot> @Iwashi94 best thing for any fighting game is what you are comfortable with
[0:40:51] <%doombawkzvs> Solidus, gotta hit them SPD my Potemkin bro
[0:40:52] <@Solidus_113> happy with the start, fell apart hard
[0:40:52] <alephalpha> so any info on how fdc works?
[0:40:59] <killaholic89> I played about 3 hours today and had no hard crashes but many server errors
[0:41:06] <SerAmeros> Wish there were tutorials ; - ;
[0:41:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Stand Ability chart?
[0:41:10] <jubejube56> Lol time to leave your lobby
[0:41:10] <SpookyBeef7> Not a fan of the floor system. Difficult to ran up, way too easy to rank down.
[0:41:11] <%yeknomlive> fdc? like sf4 fdc?
[0:41:17] <alephalpha> no
[0:41:19] <%andrei11dr> @igliak It's like a hard hit, it used too lunch people in the air for combos, if hit on the ground
[0:41:20] <DaBigVitus> It's a qliphoth
[0:41:23] <%Irridium> I FINALLY GET INTO THE SAME ROOM AND HE LEAVES FUCK
[0:41:25] <%yeknomlive> fd? or roman cancels
[0:41:26] <@Solidus_113> Day one Pot
[0:41:28] <@Menitta> dear god this lobby
[0:41:28] <+FerociousOsmosis> Woolz, just curious-- Ky only tonight or will you showcase some others?
[0:41:29] <F_Wily> A star chart
[0:41:31] <%doombawkzvs> Gotta hit that potemkin ball buster
[0:41:31] <@Menitta> why did they do this
[0:41:33] <Axle13j> why the hell would they even add a ranking system to this specifically lol
[0:41:41] <alephalpha> fualtess defense caneling allows you to cancel certain air normals for som,e nonsesne
[0:41:44] <%optimasmaximas> yeah i dont get how people float lol
[0:41:47] <alephalpha> it's still in the game
[0:41:53] <Vortigon> How are people walking in the air?
[0:41:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> I CAN'T GET OUT OF THE LOBBY CAUSE THEY'RE BLOCKING THE DOOR
[0:41:57] <woodstock_hobbs> who you fighting next
[0:41:57] <%andrei11dr> But some caracters get dust air loops like Sol
[0:41:57] <%aka_Jigawatt> mfs just walkin on air
[0:41:57] <alephalpha> but not a lot of info on it in strive eyt
[0:41:58] <%Giothegame> Gotta touch swords
[0:42:02] <+thecraye> potemkin looks really fun
[0:42:03] <KRaZyAmmo> THAT IS BULLSHIT BLAZING
[0:42:05] <jubejube56> I feel like the floating is just a weird network bug
[0:42:05] <SerAmeros> my character froze. ; - ;
[0:42:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> This lobby looks awful
[0:42:11] <Jrocy247> This Lobby doesn't look like it even belongs in this game.....
[0:42:17] <%Irridium> fuck it I fight solidus
[0:42:17] <%xpakeo> its sad because despite how bad the UI is the lobby system is still worse
[0:42:18] <alephalpha> lobby is hot garbage
[0:42:21] <woodstock_hobbs> i seriously thought the lobby was the whole game
[0:42:23] <HorseGum> give us CBT and make it hurt Kreygasm
[0:42:27] <%jiggy_snipe> man this is bad
[0:42:27] <InfinityCircuit> Nidhogg wants its lobby back

[0:44:38] <SpookyBeef7> Can legacy sticks work with this, or only current models?
[0:44:40] <Blank9> arcade stick
[0:44:42] <%Irridium> gottem
[0:44:43] <+FerociousOsmosis> mmmmm Sol
[0:44:47] <SerAmeros> I am complete garbo.
[0:44:49] <slamview> sol's new grand viper looks so fuckin good
[0:44:51] <alephalpha> reggie 5.k into bandit revolver
[0:44:53] <jubejube56> Oh that sword sync up
[0:44:54] <+FerociousOsmosis> woolz gonna stick with Ky?
[0:44:58] <%Irridium> @Solidus_113 gg
[0:45:01] <alephalpha> you can also likn to 5.k off p buttons
[0:45:03] <%Wool> Can y'all go to a higher floor later? Some of us are too high ranked.
[0:45:03] <+TeethMuncher> @xpakeo camera angle hides it
[0:45:04] <%andrei11dr> Sol is not a Ryu caracter at all, Reggie would probably do better with Ky
[0:45:05] <ManOfReason> lobby is cute, but not really functional BibleThump
[0:45:13] <alephalpha> it's fafnier c.s fafnir. cs fafnir now
[0:45:16] <+ssaltyflavor> lobby looks like ass
[0:45:16] <%andrei11dr> Yea you get 4
[0:45:18] <slamview> just tick wild throw
[0:45:19] <BigNerdSam> No no no no no. Bandit Kick.
[0:45:19] <P0wderedT0astMan> one or two wild throws and you are gucci
[0:45:31] <%xpakeo> @TeethMuncher i was joking, woolie said he had his "stick out"
[0:45:31] <jubejube56> Dolphin dolphin dolphin dolphin whale
[0:45:32] <%nothuzad> ye reggie would probably do better with ky
[0:45:49] <alephalpha> it does more damage no and you can choose your side
[0:45:52] <SerAmeros> why is it so hard to get into a match. ; - ;
[0:45:52] <alephalpha> worse moki
[0:45:58] <alephalpha> also wors eoki
[0:45:59] <Personified134> yeah but doing combo is FUN
[0:46:02] <DaHaLoJeDi> lightning rode
[0:46:03] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> so why does may still have to do a combo?
[0:46:07] <BluBox> May still has a grab that leads to combo
[0:46:07] <%yeknomlive> may's still needs to combo for her damage
[0:46:09] <%doombawkzvs> You can only hide among the sheep for so long. Come to the higher floors and hunt with the wolves.
[0:46:09] <townzzzzz> why give me the keys to a car if its going to drive itself
[0:46:19] <Personified134> you can make combos easier/less difference between easy combo and hard combo without just DELETING COMBO
[0:46:23] <glaciusinfinite> We have only one sky
[0:46:25] <%andrei11dr> Reggie, just play this like sign Sol and use nothing but Fafnier LUL
[0:46:28] <alephalpha> can't side witch with it now or get the good oki but alright
[0:46:33] <alephalpha> it does more damage though
[0:46:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> OH WORD HERO VERSUS
[0:46:34] <KRaZyAmmo> THE COLORS THE COLORS
[0:46:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, i'm in est coast usa and in lobby 6 but not finding anyone
[0:46:39] <%nothuzad> yeknomlive I think you can 5s(4x) on wall bounce into super for may
[0:46:45] <0cash> damn
[0:46:50] <DaHaLoJeDi> big boy damage
[0:46:51] <Mach5Mike> clutch
[0:47:00] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver there seem to be multiple instances. just got to get lucky. managed to find @Solidus_113 once
[0:47:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> jesus
[0:47:16] <Personified134> i think the most feelbad part is when it feels like you're putting together a really spicy combo and then the wall breaks and you're not allowed to hit them anymore
[0:47:25] <gmbt21xd> 2-14
[0:47:26] <FicboyOG> what do you guys NOT like about this game? Or hope gets some changing
[0:47:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I was in Woolie's lobby but it got interrupted
[0:47:28] <alephalpha> ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 2d
[0:47:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> this lobby system SUUUCK
[0:47:30] <alephalpha> 2d the god
[0:47:31] <@Solidus_113> there's multiple instances of each floor, just gotta get lucky and get forced into the right one
[0:47:32] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver oh hey there you are lol
[0:47:32] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus Go to a higher floor please, we're too high ranked.
[0:47:33] <Personified134> its not even that there's less combo potential, there's combo potential that you're not allowed to use
[0:47:35] <someyounguy1> why not rtl instead of sacred edge?
[0:47:37] <Mach5Mike> Nice read
[0:47:42] <slamview> I see that 2d is still goated
[0:47:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> This lobby system is butt
[0:47:46] <BluBox> RTL is the invincible super
[0:47:54] <alephalpha> @someyounguy1 literally no reason
[0:47:58] <jubejube56> C’mon axls
[0:48:13] <%andrei11dr> Oh wow, i forgot they changed ground viper to that weird uppercut
[0:48:26] <alephalpha> night raid vortecx is better then grand viper though
[0:48:27] <%kingkeldeo31> !uptime
[0:48:27] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 53 minutes and 44 seconds
[0:48:28] <someyounguy1> @alephalpha i guess that was a silly question. I know rtl is a reversal and invincible. I thought maybe someone knew something i didnt though

[0:50:12] <%Irridium> @optimasmaximas I know there's multiple instances of it though. Had to keep leaving/rejoining to get into the one he's in.
[0:50:15] <slamview> Sol is more gorilla now than ever, somehow
[0:50:39] <alephalpha> watch DEB's vod if you want more on sol
[0:50:46] <%andrei11dr> Whenever you have the corner as Sol just low Faf all day
[0:50:47] <alephalpha> and yes even mor egorilla
[0:50:51] <jubejube56> Did Faust just shed skin?!
[0:50:51] <crimsonsaens> So does this round of the beta actually work?
[0:50:53] <Personified134> BANDIT-BANDIT-BANDIT
[0:50:56] <alephalpha> the gatling changes aren't that bad for him too
[0:50:56] <mr_sups> FIGHT LIKE A TIGER!
[0:50:56] <Lazyturd> yo how has strive looked so far

[0:51:06] <killaholic89> Anyone know if Sols fire can light the Afro?
[0:51:09] <%doombawkzvs> woolieWUT_TK
[0:51:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no chipp players just yet
[0:51:14] <Personified134> strive is pretty weird and jank so far
[0:51:18] <alephalpha> @killaholic89 sadly no Idea
[0:51:19] <gmbt21xd> Basically Faust has Answer's teleportation method
[0:51:20] <Personified134> there are cool things but there are also really weird/bad things
[0:51:21] <0cash> i loved the door but this is cool too
[0:51:22] <Lazyturd> huh
[0:51:26] <Lazyturd> shame
[0:51:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:51:34] <%nothuzad> a bit too greedy with the item throws but I appreciate it :p

[0:51:39] <LVDoomien> CBT
[0:51:42] <%andrei11dr> Yea he can
[0:51:42] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus GO TO A HIGHER FLOOR
[0:51:46] <blightblues> good try
[0:51:46] <ManOfReason> faffing about Kappa
[0:51:54] <Personified134> reactions range from "its different but still pretty fun" to "this game puts me to sleep"
[0:51:57] <%Wool> i'm too high ranked
[0:51:57] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:51:58] <%Wool> lmao
[0:52:03] <DerpioParty> faff faff faff. Kreygasm
[0:52:03] <%optimasmaximas> dont do that
[0:52:04] <crimsonsaens> Doesn't it require a counterhit with Fafnir?
[0:52:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT KICKED ME OUA THE LOBBY
[0:52:06] <killaholic89> @alephalpha very niche situation so I didn’t expect people to know
[0:52:08] <FrostedZaibatsu> Guys play somebody besides Sol. Im tired of seeing the same characters
[0:52:10] <Doublemint_Dave_> Bringer fafnir was definitely Xrd but idk about strive
[0:52:12] <woodstock_hobbs> what's 1000 - 23
[0:52:12] <LVDoomien> jasmin6Duh jasmin6Duh jasmin6Duh jasmin6Duh CBT jasmin6Duh jasmin6Duh jasmin6Duh
[0:52:14] <Civet10> if you keep winning you get locked out of low floors
[0:52:15] <%bigmacjack12> Were all up there
[0:52:15] <%skylerpilot> Same, I'm locked out of 6
[0:52:20] <FicboyOG> what do you guys NOT like about this game? Or hope gets some changing
[0:52:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah, if your MMR gets high enough, they straight up ban you from lower floors
[0:52:29] <ReNhoSoft1> Gattlings
[0:52:29] <SerAmeros> I'm at the bottom ; - ;
[0:52:29] <jubejube56> We want to see live CBT
[0:52:30] <woodstock_hobbs> N/M!
[0:52:32] <jubejube56> For fun
[0:52:36] <%andrei11dr> If he catches a counter ground flame you can Fafnier him for days
[0:52:38] <woodstock_hobbs> i was hoping it was 420
[0:52:43] <%Thunderhog> Bassicly, everyone is allowed to go to rank 10, but if you're too good, you cant fight lower levels
[0:52:45] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus HOW LONG DO YOU TWO PLAN TO HIDE? COME, FACE YOUR DESTINY TO DIE AT MY LARGE POTEMKIN HANDS.
[0:52:55] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> so 10 would be the best place for getting the most people
[0:52:59] <Cobaltor_252> this UI is...modern...
[0:52:59] <LVDoomien> PogChamp the callout
[0:53:03] <DaHaLoJeDi> getting called out in chat LUL
[0:53:05] <crimsonsaens> Woolie could just go to the top then
[0:53:13] <Civet10> they want new players to have the option to face good players, but not be forced into it
[0:53:16] <Personified134> axl is pretty cool in this game from what i've seen
[0:53:19] <P0wderedT0astMan> catch dem potemkin hands
[0:53:25] <%doombawkzvs> Floor 10
[0:53:25] <%optimasmaximas> @Irridium you're a axl too nice LUL
[0:53:26] <%Wool> HeroVersus is too high ranked
[0:53:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's multiple versions of the room
[0:53:30] <jubejube56> Let’s go axl!
[0:53:31] <ManOfReason> my boi axl PogChamp
[0:53:33] <%doombawkzvs> I can't go to your floor
[0:53:34] <FboyDaKing> I want regular dust back.
[0:53:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> you gotta get lucky and get into the one you're in
[0:53:38] <+Charredasperity> this is the first axl i've seen this whole beta
[0:53:42] <0cash> axl's design is so much better now
[0:53:43] <alephalpha> @heroversusofficial dodo you have yhte unblockable heavenly pot buster setup on deck?
[0:53:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BOMBA
[0:53:53] <LVDoomien> floor 10
[0:53:57] <FboyDaKing> Also damage deduction. By just a bit.
[0:54:07] <drefizz> @WoolieVersus how are yall feeling about Strive? I'm feeling hopeful
[0:54:08] <Hanstelgotto> Axl Lows
[0:54:10] <%doombawkzvs> I've got the big daddy busters on deck
[0:54:18] <P0wderedT0astMan> cheap
[0:54:20] <%nothuzad> ye dmg could be like 10-20% lower right now wipeouts are too ahrd
[0:54:31] <%optimasmaximas> nah its cool not cheap
[0:54:38] <DaHaLoJeDi> Axl goes to McDonalds mid-match LUL
[0:54:40] <P0wderedT0astMan> scrub killer movw
[0:54:41] <FboyDaKing> Just a smidge.
[0:54:44] <P0wderedT0astMan> move
[0:54:44] <alephalpha> @heroversusofficial there's a specific setup where they can't avoid the heavenly
[0:54:45] <Personified134> bring the damage down and put the damage in the wallbreaks to make them feel better, and the game is probably a lot better
[0:54:51] <%Struggleful> "Did you just Jump" - Axl
[0:54:58] <sperium3000> These dashes actually allow for a lot of new tech
[0:54:59] <crimsonsaens> Sigils are cool though, Woolie
[0:55:02] <alephalpha> you can also still fdc
[0:55:03] <@Solidus_113> 40% damage busters
[0:55:06] <@Solidus_113> minimum
[0:55:07] <Personified134> just put the counter-dust combo mechanic in the wallbreak imo
[0:55:10] <alephalpha> you can fdc the dash as well
[0:55:33] <jubejube56> An alternate reality where axl has no charge motions
[0:55:34] <%andrei11dr> Axl did use to be pretty low tier in Xrd
[0:55:42] <FrostedZaibatsu> As a Potemkin player i love to see you air dash at me
[0:55:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> he tried it
[0:55:45] <Personified134> axl does not look low tier in this game so far
[0:55:47] <%Irridium> BODIED
[0:55:47] <crimsonsaens> Is Reggie a fraud?
[0:55:48] <%kingkeldeo31> Perfect
[0:55:51] <Blank9> peed on
[0:55:52] <alephalpha> AXL was god tier for the first week of sign wher enoone knew
[0:55:56] <%OkNow_64> BALLS EXPOSED

[0:56:05] <+thrice_cooked_pork> Axls lips Kreygasm
[0:56:07] <DaHaLoJeDi> fraudulence
[0:56:07] <%xpakeo> evo19Lame
[0:56:08] <%doombawkzvs> That killer B lariat finish
[0:56:09] <%gatorafan> To think all Axl needed to be cool was a pair of pants daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:56:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> i found the lobby
[0:56:10] <+TeethMuncher> @alephalpha don't remind me
[0:56:11] <%Gigmunch> @andrei11dr So low tier in fact Mike Ross Maine’s him
[0:56:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> Fraud detected
[0:56:20] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus just get in
[0:56:21] <%Chichen> im bad at fighters and have no clue what im doing but im winning a few
[0:56:23] <%andrei11dr> Reggie got ZONED
[0:56:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> He got pants, therefore he got stronger
[0:56:32] <alephalpha> @TeethMuncher I play I-no the axl matchup is 7-3 in his favor still
[0:56:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> Mike "Waxl" Ross mains Axl??
[0:56:45] <%xpakeo> whats stronger, pants or booty shorts?
[0:56:52] <Vortigon> Mike "Mike Ross" Ross
[0:57:00] <FboyDaKing> Yer.
[0:57:05] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:57:25] <+TeethMuncher> @xpakeo pants with the zipper at the knees
[0:57:27] <SerAmeros> I wish this beta had some sort of tutorial.
[0:57:27] <crimsonsaens> Pants are definitely stronger
[0:57:28] <Ognjenco> just tuned in: What are the impressions so far?
[0:57:32] <%nothuzad> 2 braincells
[0:57:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sol v sol, PURE UNGA
[0:57:37] <slamview> Just two trains crashing into each other repeatedly
[0:57:39] <%zk_nails> Sol mates
[0:57:46] <%doombawkzvs> How many have I potemkin busted? How many loaves of bread have you eaten in your life? woolieWUT_TK
[0:57:48] <crimsonsaens> All Sol players share the same braincell
[0:57:48] <%nothuzad> braincell meets braincell
[0:57:53] <%xpakeo> that sounds like a hazard lol @TeethMuncher
[0:57:56] <FboyDaKing> I wonder if any of the floors will be called tornado of souls.
[0:57:59] <+jepupu> Airdash
[0:58:15] <%andrei11dr> Yea whild trow still has broken damage too
[0:58:16] <%doombawkzvs> Reggie not practicing responsible social distancing

[1:03:34] <%gatorafan> Can Woolie see the colors? daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:03:37] <KRaZyAmmo> S H O C K S T A T E
[1:03:40] <spardanwarrior> Isn't the Strive lore that Faust grafted some of Zappa's skin onto himself to try and find a way to cure him and that's why Faust is all fucked up?
[1:03:46] <%nothuzad> he doesnt know gatorafan :)
[1:03:50] <FboyDaKing> @nintega010 don’t tell me. I’m only on part 5.
[1:03:50] <+Hollow_Mirage> Wait I keep getting the Shadow Blob from BBs name wrong

[1:03:52] <%Irridium> anyway echodrop if you here gg
[1:04:02] <Jrocy247> Man....Was Faust always this tall?
[1:04:08] <%nothuzad> spardanwarrior ye - and zappas problem is that he gets possessed by ghosties

[1:04:16] <%Javaa01> Faust has always been incredibly tall
[1:04:22] <%xpakeo> faust is every womans dream
[1:04:23] <+sinistersally> I'm getting more of a Baldhead vibe
[1:04:24] <%nothuzad> andrei11dr its new to strive - just amplifies certain attacks damage
[1:04:25] <alephalpha> ky is hot
[1:04:26] <+Hollow_Mirage> He was always this tall he just used to always crouch

[1:05:10] <Doublemint_Dave_> Wow mapping the dash button is big brain
[1:05:10] <Jrocy247> I knew Faust had to above average height looking at his lanky legs and arms. But damn
[1:05:10] <FboyDaKing> @steelmorrigan yep.
[1:05:12] <%SirGO0SE> skill is a luck
[1:05:16] <%steelmorrigan> Niiiiiiiiiiiiice
[1:05:19] <%jiggy_snipe> nope

[1:05:40] <%gatorafan> @fboydaking, feels like 50/50 to me so far, but the good tracks are REALLY good
[1:05:42] <%doombawkzvs> "There is no such thing as a lucky punch" - Hajime no Ippo
[1:05:43] <P0wderedT0astMan> Daisuke says it therefore its true

[1:32:08] <@Menitta> Man what happened to this games style
[1:32:09] <+fizzguy47> No, I will do things the hard way!
[1:32:14] <@Menitta> in UI and menus
[1:32:16] <khetrak> is this the online hud ?
[1:32:16] <+Checktrap> then he has to learn a new buttton
[1:32:20] <%nothuzad> 2 clean pot busters just straight kill chipp :)
[1:32:25] <%jiggy_snipe> @nothuzad interesting thx
[1:32:37] <%andrei11dr> I usually just have the RC on a button

[1:33:01] <+Proxzo> man this UI is really boring
[1:33:13] <+Proxzo> Its so sterile
[1:33:23] <@Solidus_113> kicking you out to show you a floor change, players not being accurately shown
[1:33:24] <@Menitta> Its sterile yeah

[1:33:52] <%deviljhojho_> i tought this lobby was an april fools joke
[1:33:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:33:55] <+ssaltyflavor> mapping RC is totally unnecessary since on stick your fingers naturally resto n those buttons
[1:34:02] <%deviljhojho_> at least the important part of the game looks phenomenal tho

[1:42:59] <WakeUpThrow> @Qualitybeats Yes, at about 40ish % life
[1:43:02] <bigshedman> @Qualitybeats Xrd had a system where the lower your health, the less damage individual hits do. Assuming that Strive has it as well.
[1:43:10] <Captain_Aham> Pot is T H E B O Y
[1:43:11] <%andrei11dr> Man, they better change this lobby by the time it comes out

[1:43:38] <Dapper_Cactuar> one does not simply go near Potemkin
[1:43:41] <UnknownGerm> I always thought that health bars just get denser towards the end?
[1:43:53] <%SirGO0SE> OH hoho, you're approaching me?

[1:47:38] <bazz_tv> the UI and HUD make MVCI's look good
[1:47:40] <yeildingthought> Always the online system
[1:47:47] <@Menitta> why you gotta be different
[1:47:49] <bleugh> oh it doesn't have rollback?
[1:47:50] <+adimcorner> I think it's cute but i bet it could get annoying
[1:47:51] <%yeetdabsenpai69> there is dokapon today right?
[1:47:54] <BigNerdSam> I think this lobby system should have two arcade sticks in ts background, just for giggles.
[1:47:59] <0cash> no rollback yet
[1:48:01] <+Sendaar> I mean its super "Stage 1: denial" but this lobby system seems like a placeholder, especially considering they're already changing the online
[1:48:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:48:03] <BigNerdSam> *arcade machines
[1:48:03] <%nothuzad> Wool rollback will have nothing to do with the lobbies thats just for in fight
[1:48:11] <%yeetdabsenpai69> just making sure
[1:48:13] <%Wool> @yeetdabsenpai69 yes
[1:48:18] <%yeetdabsenpai69> ok nice

[1:48:43] <jubejube56> That is a lot of effort on pixel art to put towards a placeholder
[1:48:51] <khetrak> btw, how did reggie got to first place on dokappon? for some reason my twitch is broken and keep skiping around 30 of the video where that happen
[1:49:00] <%Wool> s h o c k s t a t e
[1:49:11] <%purplehermit12> @khetrak lotter gave him a lot of money, but also he completed the quest

[1:49:18] <jubejube56> @khetrak it will be on YouTube but basically some shit happened in the casino cave
[1:49:23] <crimsonsaens> Woolie won the card game
[1:49:25] <mr_sups> No one can see the Colors but YOOUUUU!
[1:49:25] <bazz_tv> to be honest considering it is a beta, the lobbies should had just been a list of players and thats it
[1:49:26] <ElPlasa> legit question, what does shockstate do?
[1:49:31] <khetrak> the rescue the princess quest?
[1:49:33] <+Sendaar> I mean not having rematch seems like an insane oversight
[1:49:34] <%purplehermit12> yes
[1:49:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> he needs to just raw super against him when he jumps
[1:49:38] <crimsonsaens> Reggie got towns and the castle in the latest continent

[2:02:10] <Doublemint_Dave_> Likely lag
[2:02:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:02:10] <%andrei11dr> Has Reggie ever mained a non poster boy caracter?
[2:02:34] <khetrak> oh yeah, reggie always main the basic poster boy right
[2:02:39] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think he plays Hyde in Uni
[2:02:47] <%Livelinne> I saw Pornaleff
[2:02:55] <%PR0swagonist> show us your stick reggie
[2:03:12] <+pectusumbra> The Reaper is drawing close~
[2:03:24] <C4m3r0n0409> you just saw two people challenge eachother dude
[2:03:31] <hepheros> that polnareff is a god for sure
[2:03:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Please give us the cabinets
[2:03:41] <woodstock_hobbs> i'm on a quest to find someone online, i don't have a dime. but i thought i might drop by and say hi
[2:03:46] <Zayasu> just give us a menu :)
[2:03:48] <AppleBerryKitty> seriously whos idea was it to make that kinda lobby in a game like this
[2:03:49] <GoldeNOVA> How is it unclear?
[2:03:49] <@Menitta> they just wanna sit lol
[2:03:58] <%andrei11dr> This is way too complicated for no reason
[2:04:02] <crimsonsaens> Just give a menu
[2:04:03] <0cash> its unclear and connection is unstable so its even worse than a normal experience would be
[2:04:06] <%Livelinne> woolieOMG
[2:04:08] <+ElectricFoxLex> There are no bars
[2:04:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh god that's trure
[2:04:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> *true
[2:04:15] <cham52> How's that CBT?
[2:04:16] <%andrei11dr> Id rather just have a menu
[2:04:18] <%ekodrop> today's beta ends in 28minutes
[2:04:24] <khetrak> i like the idea of a tower where you select your skill level
[2:04:48] <bazz_tv> i don't get why arc is so desperate to be cute with their online modes, a list would be perfectly fine, you don't play fighting games for the menus
[2:04:53] <@Menitta> CBT is good... Oh the beta? Dunno
[2:05:14] <YaxxbassDK> what this is not a nintendo game = 0
[2:05:20] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie rival
[2:05:24] <+fizzguy47> @bazz_tv The irony, right?
[2:05:28] <DedlokPM> Clip is late but... https://clips.twitch.tv/MotionlessLongCobblerJonCarnage
[2:05:29] <%jiggy_snipe> his Vergil KappaHD
[2:05:35] <+ElectricFoxLex> Yep J Dash is one of the 4 Galford reps
[2:05:42] <%andrei11dr> Even in Rollback you'll still feel a McDonald wifi connection
[2:05:53] <%Wool> this is some Closed Beta Torture
[2:05:58] <+Sendaar> I'm starting to see why they called this CBT
[2:06:04] <SomersaultJustice> do those sick dolphin combos
[2:06:14] <BigNerdSam> So the game put me in 2 and for some reason I'm doing better in lobby 4. Why not just do regular matchmaking for the beta instead of the lobby system?
[2:06:15] <townzzzzz> don't stop jumping
[2:06:21] <+BaronBattle> fun to play, but this lobby system is fuckin ass
[2:06:22] <%Livelinne> Maaay VirtualHug
[2:06:28] <+Charredasperity> May is so dang cute
[2:06:28] <%Jetzord> Everyone loves Marineland
[2:06:33] <woodstock_hobbs> i need to get boys don't cry from the cure
[2:06:36] <%andrei11dr> Just jump dust all day
[2:06:40] <%Solidnick18> yep
[2:06:43] <@Solidus_113> All this menu work, just trash it
[2:06:50] <woodstock_hobbs> go girl, i'm rootin for the anchor babe
[2:06:52] <bazz_tv> like the only time i have seen this type of lobbies work is for fighting them herds, and thats because despite all the bells and whistles is still fairly simple and has GGPO
[2:06:54] <woodstock_hobbs> i forget who i play as
[2:06:58] <+ssaltyflavor> Overhall some of the gameplay too
[2:06:59] <+Sendaar> I wonder how Japan players feel about this lobby system
[2:07:00] <@Menitta> The everything around the core game just sucks
[2:07:03] <%Solidnick18> don't fix what ain't broke
[2:07:16] <+OroOreo> stick to the good guns not the bad guns
[2:07:21] <@Menitta> Like they went from Persona 5 menus to SNK rom lists
[2:07:23] <%gatorafan> @bazz_tv, also, the lobbies are way bigger and people can space themselves properly.
[2:07:25] <%nothuzad> well the interface of teh game outside of the "gameplay" is kinda sucky
[2:07:26] <%andrei11dr> They need to fix the lobby and UI ,
[2:07:27] <BigNerdSam> Here's my May tech: get into your corner and when the enemy attacks: 236236H
[2:07:36] <+ssaltyflavor> undo all the SFV shit going on
[2:07:37] <woodstock_hobbs> i played the heck out of this game in the end of highschool on the gba
[2:07:44] <0cash> does she still have the whiny super?
[2:07:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> She's a gorilla Reggie, get in there
[2:07:52] <+Sendaar> May is a real get the fuck in character
[2:07:54] <+Charredasperity> no whiney super anymore
[2:07:54] <GroundControl138> @andrei11dr they won't :(
[2:08:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @0cash Whiney super is gone, she's all grown up now\
[2:08:05] <0cash> damn
[2:08:06] <woodstock_hobbs> hit the big time. add the circus
[2:08:12] <%Thunderhog> So 6p can combo into it's self on wall splat
[2:08:21] <%nothuzad> may is a gorilla like sol just with a good braincell count V:
[2:08:21] <%andrei11dr> Reggie, just just forward and dust
[2:08:23] <drefizz> i love may's voice
[2:08:32] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> It is?
[2:08:34] <0cash> yeah it'd be weird with the artstyle change @AlteisenReiseZ
[2:08:35] <woodstock_hobbs> does anyone know what time matt is on
[2:08:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> She's a gorilla in Spats
[2:08:38] <%nothuzad> yes you can loop 6p for like 4-5 times on wallsplat into super
[2:08:40] <YaxxbassDK> game looks sick!
[2:08:42] <%gatorafan> This game is so pretty to look at tho daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:09:00] <wisconsinjoe> Is this the CBT stream coneyVINCE
[2:09:03] <evilthecat17> 'Member XX may who could mix up every single special move she had?
[2:09:10] <+KaizenShio> to be honest they can keep the 8 bit aesthetic BUT PUT ARCADE CABINETS BACK
[2:09:13] <%skylerpilot> You don't need to RC overhead kiss (her command grab) you naturally get a combo after it
[2:09:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:09:24] <bazz_tv> the lore is that May is japanese and japanese are power freaks in the GG universe for reasons i forgot
[2:09:27] <woodstock_hobbs> i'm talking to a mirror. and i don't know what it's about
[2:09:36] <+Charredasperity> it's not a wall
[2:09:40] <BigNerdSam> >CBT Stream gigaboOtsMJOW
[2:09:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nippon strong
[2:09:44] <crimsonsaens> It's more of an oki ball, I think
[2:09:44] <%gatorafan> All of May's braincells are busy thinking about Johnny.
[2:09:47] <bazz_tv> also they are almost extinct in gg
[2:09:49] <woodstock_hobbs> i was playing hero's with those death match walls
[2:09:56] <%nothuzad> bazz_tv cuz japanese inherently can use ki - theres almost nobody outside japan that can do it - but japan also got super nuked :)
[2:09:59] <ElPlasa> @23logik whatever you do don't give the mirror a gun
[2:10:06] <Xeno351> how soon til the real fighting game? the irl dokapon hands
[2:10:11] <%andrei11dr> I thought that only Baiken and Anji were Japanese
[2:10:13] <BigNerdSam> Pro May Tip: Corner Yamadas.
[2:10:15] <bazz_tv> yeah i remember Justice fucked Japan up too
[2:10:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Only japanese people left in GG is, May, Baiken, Anji (M.I.A)
[2:10:21] <%nothuzad> andrei11dr no may is japanese too
[2:10:23] <woodstock_hobbs> @333agus333 i
[2:10:30] <%yeetdabsenpai69> DARKLING DAY
[2:10:35] <+Charredasperity> In GG Japan was the location of the gear's first appearance and Justice's rampage, the survivors got superpowers somehow
[2:10:40] <%skylerpilot> You don't need to RC overhead kiss (her command grab) you naturally get a combo after it
[2:10:41] <%nothuzad> AlteisenReiseZ for fighters yes - but there are a few hundred japanese in colonies
[2:10:42] <+parzano> blood pool?
[2:10:45] <woodstock_hobbs> @333agus333 i'll never look at a mirror the same
[2:10:50] <%yeetdabsenpai69> HYPE IT UP FOR DARKLINGTON
[2:10:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @nothuzad true true
[2:11:03] <%andrei11dr> Actually the black dude might be from Japan too
[2:11:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> And Johnny can use it to an extent
[2:11:21] <evilthecat17> Japan is where all the ki users where and Ki is the strongest form of magic so Justice nuked the fuck out of Japan in an attempt to eliminate ki
[2:11:23] <%andrei11dr> Or at least has been there
[2:11:26] <+ElectricFoxLex> I alsi was in the last online WNF @woolieversus
[2:11:36] <%cloudman_exe> I am jumping between 10th floors just for a chance to run it with you
[2:11:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> alas, chipp
[2:11:39] <%nothuzad> Charredasperity no the reason why is cuz japanese were able to use "ki" inherently which is like the scariest type of magic and only very few outside can actually master it (Kliff was like the only european person who did)
[2:11:45] <WakeUpThrow> Kum is japanese too, right? I can't recall
[2:11:45] <bazz_tv> talking about GG lore, can anyone explain me why people keep saying Ky is now a gear? i haven't been able to find any reference that says or implyies that
[2:11:53] <%Solidnick18> oh no
[2:11:55] <Phob05> The difficulty of this lobby is very bad
[2:11:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CHIPP TIME

[2:12:16] <%andrei11dr> @wakeupthrow Nah Kum is just a robot that looks Japanese
[2:12:18] <@Solidus_113> Chipp's taunt is fucked
[2:12:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> VERTICAL COMBOS

[2:13:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> That's MY president KKona
[2:13:30] <Klefth> God, this game is gorgeous, wtf...

[2:14:26] <%purplehermit12> Chipp is one shot johnny
[2:14:28] <%Javaa01> If you touch Chipp, he dies
[2:14:29] <supahrob64> YARR
[2:14:30] <+Hoozzyy> Should i practise in XDR to get ready for stive?
[2:14:32] <%NWannabe> poor chipp
[2:14:36] <bazz_tv> to be fair if Naruto would also take the damage of each clone, he would be fucked too
[2:14:37] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> chipp is made of paper and may is a fucking rock
[2:14:37] <tolloponik> and like that reggie has become the cancer
[2:14:39] <orcaxorca> Chipp has like 680 street fighter health
[2:14:41] <Deadbulky> God the lobby is so bad
[2:14:48] <ElPlasa> @Javaa01 if you look at Chip he dies
[2:14:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Danndy_Guy_in_Space LUL
[2:14:49] <%nothuzad> Hoozzyy strive is somewhat different but some concepts certainly will be able to be carried over

[2:14:56] <+itsOnyxLeo> LUL LUL
[2:14:57] <%Jetzord> He buffed his muscles when he really needed to buff his bones
[2:15:04] <%purplehermit12> Chipp does a lot of damage but he also fucking breaks his bones when he gets hit
[2:15:05] <supahrob64> When you ask Chipp for the time of day he faints
[2:15:07] <+OroOreo> really digging this game except for the lobby
[2:15:08] <woodstock_hobbs> so what if this was the game, but they won based on random algorithems with criti persents and basic stat damage
[2:15:08] <%Javaa01> He needs some milk
[2:15:11] <%Javaa01> He really does
[2:15:11] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> How dare yall correct me LuL
[2:15:17] <Dhurkst> @woolieversus Great game, Reggie!

[2:19:30] <woodstock_hobbs> we'll use the 3d anime graphics in the game vic poes
[2:19:36] <supahrob64> I like to think instead of "unga bunga", May is more like "*LOUD SEAWORLD NOISES*"
[2:19:38] <%nothuzad> Wool I think without risc V:
[2:19:41] <crimsonsaens> I'm disappointed Woolie has dodged Octopimp this whole time
[2:19:55] <woodstock_hobbs> my next character is a care bare. he gives hugs to gain hp and give hp
[2:20:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> @crimsonsaens he'll get him in the full release dont worry
[2:20:09] <%nothuzad> crimsonsaens octo would just devestate him - hed be blown out before dokapon even starts V:
[2:20:16] <+Conzanagi> Chipps theme is really strong in this one.
[2:20:18] <bazz_tv> Daisuke music never gets old
[2:20:25] <%Solidnick18> hmm
[2:20:33] <supahrob64> LUL Start the Woolie salt before Dokapon
[2:20:36] <woodstock_hobbs> lazy boy. the white boy with no job. logs onto the internet to gain health. sends email to heal others.
[2:20:52] <%Javaa01> It's stuck trying to match already, so you can't match currently
[2:20:53] <%ekodrop> thinking it's winding down
[2:20:54] <BabyNaBackbrace> beautiful game, only dipped my toes in GG before but might get into this one
[2:20:59] <+liquidzr0> HahaSleep
[2:20:59] <%Javaa01> Pay attention to the bottom left messages
[2:21:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WHAT A GREAT BETA
[2:21:05] <%nothuzad> basic
[2:21:07] <%Javaa01> Those tell you what the game is actually doing
[2:21:08] <Klefth> An AWFUL lobby, you mean
[2:21:13] <%Javaa01> So just rejoin the lobby
[2:21:16] <supahrob64> Some of these guys are screaming at each other across the fast food area's parking lot
[2:21:17] <@Solidus_113> Fightin Herds does this better
[2:21:18] <Deadbulky> Habo hotel has a better lobby LUL
[2:21:23] <bazz_tv> UGLY ass lobby
[2:21:23] <HorseGum> a retro style lobby could even work... just not this way lul
[2:21:34] <supahrob64> @Solidus_113 TRU
[2:21:35] <%fuji_92> bad lobby is bad
[2:21:41] <Genericname54321> i just found the member list and I wish that was just the lobby
[2:21:41] <+Charredasperity> blazblue did retro fine
[2:21:42] <bazz_tv> if you gonna go retro use actual sprites
[2:21:45] <%Rivalsz> It’s advised to not get grouped up for the match making to work
[2:21:45] <%Irridium> god this lobby is awful
[2:21:46] <legacyofsol> .. so are there different lobbies on the same floor? I can't seem to find you & your player positioning looks different.
[2:21:50] <Xeno351> fightin heards does do this better damn
[2:21:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie most people were born after arcades
[2:21:52] <khetrak> why learn from the past games when you can just remake everything from the start again and again
[2:21:54] <Zayasu> arcsys & habbo hotel partnership PogChamp
[2:21:55] <%Rivalsz> Leave them alone guys
[2:22:11] <Mach5Mike> I kind of like the 3D chibi avatars more with the arcade machines
[2:22:15] <Deadbulky> Lobbys closed Kappa
[2:22:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> Allota people never saw a cabinet
[2:22:17] <%SirGO0SE> granblue lobby top tier lobby
[2:22:27] <BigNerdSam> Never Forget: Max's Ring of Beerus
[2:22:29] <%purplehermit12> hell bbtags lobby system worked
[2:22:37] <+Conzanagi> Granblue's lobby works pretty well
[2:22:39] <bazz_tv> is not that great but is at least functional
[2:22:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Granblue does Cabinets, but it doesn't show bars
[2:22:45] <UnfilteredComic> monkaS
[2:22:45] <%Solidnick18> thee lost soul
[2:22:45] <bazz_tv> this is barely functional
[2:22:56] <%fuji_92> granblue lobby is pretty good tho
[2:22:57] <Xeno351> maybe they're just not used to people actually wanting to play guilty gear LUL
[2:23:01] <woodstock_hobbs> you can use the free run from dc
[2:23:14] <legacyofsol> I was called Lost Soul & I didn't have any of the same players you did.
[2:23:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[2:23:22] <giogio346> omg fumio936's latest artwork on twitter Kreygasm
[2:23:25] <%nothuzad> but give critical feedback
[2:23:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> "were not accepting new members at this time"
[2:23:32] <%nothuzad> critical feedback big important
[2:23:35] <+zepelinnn1> most people should complain
[2:23:35] <+Conzanagi> The only problem in the GBFV lobbies are the RPers
[2:23:36] <bazz_tv> so what has arc against System of a Down anyway?
[2:23:41] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> Woolie Im in the lobby fight me
[2:23:44] <%SuperKirby24> "nah but its only for this beta tho" LUL
[2:23:44] <+zepelinnn1> its a beta, its made for you to complain
[2:23:52] <%Solidnick18> i feel that
[2:23:53] <themightyseptopus> stress free stress test LUL
[2:23:53] <woodstock_hobbs> ok. i forgot the ai leveling system
[2:23:56] <%Superbro64> didnt sfv have rollback, and a beta, and was an absolute disaster on launch?
[2:23:56] <woodstock_hobbs> i'll be right back
[2:23:58] <%NWannabe> but japan tho
[2:24:03] <%fuji_92> man, thank God there'll be rollback
[2:24:06] <woodstock_hobbs> i have to check with the voices inside my head
[2:24:06] <%Wool> Game wants you to play Dokapon
[2:24:11] <%doombawkzvs> Rip
[2:24:20] <%nothuzad> Superbro64 well that games production was mostly all wack
[2:24:20] <DeathByPoke7> fighting games are 70% menus 30% actual fighting
[2:24:20] <%purplehermit12> isnt the beta ending for today?
[2:24:23] <%Wool> CBT is telling you to play Dokapon
[2:24:24] <Xeno351> Riot fighting game when? am i right?
[2:24:29] <bazz_tv> @Superbro64 SFV bad launch was because it was realeased with barely any content
[2:24:34] <woodstock_hobbs> no, you need an rpg fighting game -file error
[2:24:53] <bazz_tv> SFV got progressively better since
[2:24:55] <%Sparkseid> it's the eordt
[2:24:58] <%Hacerous> how are the guys feeling about the beta so far?
[2:25:03] <%Sparkseid> *worst*
[2:25:09] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> Thats betas for ya I guess
[2:25:14] <%Livelinne> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:25:18] <%Wool> the suspense
[2:25:18] <%BinaryFireball> come on kubernetttteeeesss
[2:25:19] <garidoskill> i get the most matches just standing with my weapon out
[2:25:21] <+zepelinnn1> fill out those surveys
[2:25:23] <woodstock_hobbs> this file must be delivered to wan wan in order to get the emotional drive
[2:25:24] <supahrob64> Goddamn you GG let our bois play!
[2:25:25] <%fuji_92> damn BibleThump
[2:25:28] <%Superbro64> I do wonder if the arbitration from lobbies could be better spent on a simple menu system that just gets people into games
[2:25:29] <+Mondeiya> is it bc of the room?
[2:25:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can HERA the game chugging
[2:25:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> Has a sword fighting joke been madeyet
[2:25:35] <%doombawkzvs> Rip
[2:25:39] <woodstock_hobbs> levling based upon how the character feels based on how
[2:25:42] <woodstock_hobbs> hmmm....
[2:25:45] <%Livelinne> Why tho
[2:25:45] <CookieDoughFK> @WoolieVersus Are you guys going to try the new Granblue chareters on an upcoming "Getting into fighting games" ?
[2:25:46] <%gatorafan> Fighting Games are closed Kappa
[2:25:50] <%Wool> Minh's messing up the connection so you play Dokapon
[2:25:51] <Mordexai0> I like the fact the floors are named after bands and songs
[2:25:55] <HorseGum> don't walk around with your sword out
[2:25:56] <bazz_tv> some of the best lobbies in the genre are just user list
[2:25:58] <HorseGum> there's kids here Kappa
[2:26:01] <%andrei11dr> Don't just love it when you set the server for Europe and it gives you motherfuckers from Chile Kappa
[2:26:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> uh oh
[2:26:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Game is ok, Lobby is absolute ResidentSleeper
[2:26:07] <%Livelinne> woolieYE
[2:26:07] <%nothuzad> CookieDoughFK Season 1 ends at the end of the month with big balance patch so that could be a good option
[2:26:07] <%Kriss1827> yikes
[2:26:08] <%BinaryFireball> but to be real game devs are not internet devs and internet devs are rarely hired to work on games
[2:26:11] <supahrob64> That bird has been trying to find the connection for hours now
[2:26:13] <bazz_tv> like thrid strike online edition has amazing lobbies
[2:26:14] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:26:16] <%SuperKirby24> eqgle got hit with za warudo LUL
[2:26:20] <woodstock_hobbs> oh but the card game, that's got to be with miyamoto. he's got that. andthe computer is in the garbage. a card betting system where stats are gained by collecting cards
[2:26:23] <%Solidnick18> the emergency landing
[2:26:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wooolie would be a Ky player

[2:36:25] <%nothuzad> scrubquotes twitter will have a field day with strive release
[2:36:27] <+egalitarian696969> This CBT gives me less confidence in their rollback netcode.
[2:36:34] <%Solidnick18> remember to fill out that survey
[2:36:43] <%andrei11dr> Also broken as Order Sol
[2:36:46] <%agumon9000> Yo just joined the stream is no Dokapon today?
[2:36:51] <xiccy> SOCIETY
[2:36:56] <%nothuzad> egalitarian696969 ? the netcode in place even if it isnt even the real one was pretty decent for delaye based stuff
[2:36:58] <FrostedZaibatsu> Boomer Gear
[2:36:59] <%Rivalsz> No dokapon
[2:37:01] <alephalpha> I'm one of those negativ eones
[2:37:01] <@Solidus_113> That survey has a list of characters and is asking who you want to see
[2:37:08] <%nothuzad> but we obviously wont know until its out
[2:37:10] <SoromopsEX> Should I get Accent Core or REV2? moopokeThink
[2:37:11] <+ssaltyflavor> any game where the I can do the same optimal combos as a pro, there's a problem
[2:37:12] <+ChrisAlgoo> plus hard r
[2:37:13] <CookieDoughFK> Decided to get into granblue, since I'm almost completely new to fighting games
[2:37:25] <Zayasu> @agumon9000 should be now. after a break maybe
[2:37:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:37:30] <jubejube56> @solidus_113 lol clearly ArcSys already knows that the lobby is a perfect creature
[2:37:40] <@Solidus_113> Rev 2 is $14 RIGHT NOW on PC https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-and-rev-2-all-in-one-and-dlc-characters
[2:37:44] <alephalpha> @Soromops5050 rev2 has the larger community for now but there's project to add ggpo to +r
[2:37:46] <ManlyMcBeefington> !schedule
[2:37:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[2:38:00] <Qualitybeats> It’s growing on me. I was not happy yesterday. Today I had fun and want more. Tomorrow morning we’ll see
[2:38:03] <alephalpha> @Soromops5050 I fele that rev2 is easier to get into as well
[2:38:08] <+ssaltyflavor> yeah but why does GG have to be that game
[2:38:15] <%Solidnick18> i'm worried alittle
[2:38:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> We playin stupid
[2:38:18] <%Rivalsz> This is street fighter
[2:38:18] <ManlyMcBeefington> we not getting dokapon today?
[2:38:19] <%Superbro64> Something tells me the habbo hotel is what we will get
[2:38:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> Boys coming wit the Low iq
[2:38:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> We going dumb
[2:38:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The game kinda cooled on me TBH. I go to GG for the big COMBO
[2:38:32] <SoromopsEX> REV 2 IS literally 10€ omfg
[2:38:35] <%Superbro64> I would just prefer menus, but this is fine I suppose
[2:38:35] <%purplehermit12> Okay but new game doesnt mean good game though
[2:38:36] <jubejube56> Just don’t expect guilty gear from guilty gear and you are good
[2:38:36] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> Its a different flavor of gear and thats sucks for people who want classic gear
[2:38:50] <@Solidus_113> Damage is fucking WACK
[2:38:52] <blightblues> damage is too high
[2:38:52] <+VariantX7> Just tuned in and why does Woolie look so serious
[2:38:56] <%Rivalsz> Don’t expect guilty gear from strive
[2:39:02] <%Rivalsz> Ftfy
[2:39:05] <SoromopsEX> Thanks @Solidus_113 lytTHUMBSUP
[2:39:12] <ManlyMcBeefington> chat is dokapon happening today?
[2:39:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yes
[2:39:23] <Zayasu> @ManlyMcBeefington yes
[2:39:23] <MattDemers> Game will be permadead if it takes a season for that to self-correct.
[2:39:23] <%Superbro64> Maybe if matches are required best out of 5, I would be fine with the damage
[2:39:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> Damage isnt high. Its scales at the end of the round
[2:39:26] <%andrei11dr> Fuckin Esports, WHERE'S MIKE ROSS AT ,WE NEED THE PROFET
[2:39:27] <GoldeNOVA> Dokapon is happening, chill
[2:39:27] <narcowski> I think highly situational ToDs like CH DoT or puffball on some characters in AC are okay, but Strive damage is definitely higher than it should be right now
[2:39:27] <Mach5Mike> I kind of like the high damage, gets rounds over with so I can get to the next exchange in neutral rather than getting hit by a 10 second touch of death
[2:39:30] <%nothuzad> legacy0117 minh is already there
[2:39:33] <ManlyMcBeefington> kool thanks chat
[2:39:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SvenHolgersson
[2:39:34] <%aka_Jigawatt> COCK AND BALL TORTURE
[2:39:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> High Damage..... Kreygasm Kreygasm....Finna get stoopid
[2:39:45] <+ssaltyflavor> simplifying games has never been proven to attract newcomers
[2:39:45] <SvenHolgersson> MAKE ME MOO
[2:39:46] <%Solidnick18> i don't know man you wanna come out swinging
[2:39:52] <%purplehermit12> "everything can change"
[2:39:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I think High damage should come with High Execution tbh
[2:39:57] <%nothuzad> Mach5Mike the damage could be like 10-20% dmg lower and it probably would be fine
[2:39:57] <%purplehermit12> the ui still looks super simplistic
[2:39:58] <+Fenrein> I get wanting to stick to design philosophies, but after some amount of complaining you'd think they'd get the hint
[2:40:03] <blightblues> they have decided to stand their ground
[2:40:03] <%Superbro64> that they did
[2:40:06] <%Rivalsz> Potemkin running wild with slide head
[2:40:08] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> they know the kind of game they want to make and I dont think any amount of fan complaining is going to change that
[2:40:10] <Qualitybeats> The damage and lobby system are my biggest concerns. I don’t mind it being a new take on GG instead of another iteration
[2:40:12] <blackkanye> I had fun
[2:40:14] <Div_the_Penguin> I don't like moving portraits and risc gauge
[2:40:17] <@Solidus_113> Xrd on launch is not Rev 2
[2:40:20] <@Solidus_113> This'll be the same
[2:40:22] <%Superbro64> wasnt the impression they gave that strive was a spin off of sorts anyway?
[2:40:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> Execution is for high iqs
[2:40:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> we do dumb now.
[2:40:37] <+ssaltyflavor> yeah but why in god
[2:40:44] <%Rivalsz> You telling me this is isuka
[2:40:56] <%nothuzad> nah this aint no isuka
[2:41:08] <%andrei11dr> The decision is to take the throw usually
[2:41:09] <%Rivalsz> Overhead does as much damage as THIS?
[2:41:12] <%Rivalsz> Not true
[2:41:15] <+ssaltyflavor> if we're at a point where Granblu and like SFV is our comparison for a GG game we're fucked
[2:41:16] <%purplehermit12> morluns super dumb
[2:41:19] <+Fenrein> The gattling changes still don't hit me the right way
[2:41:19] <Daba_mk2> it was
[2:41:27] <Kenny_Riot> Every time Morlun shows up, it's dumb
[2:41:28] <Daba_mk2> don't save your time
[2:41:30] <GoldeNOVA> Give me big damage instead of infinite combos, ANYDAY
[2:41:30] <SvenHolgersson> You mean the vampires whose SWORN ENEMIES are spiders
[2:41:43] <SvenHolgersson> Or is that something else
[2:41:48] <Qualitybeats> I’d say it’s more SamSho than SFV tho
[2:41:52] <alephalpha> everyone has combos in strive that deal 60-80%
[2:41:58] <%optimasmaximas> happy bday wool
