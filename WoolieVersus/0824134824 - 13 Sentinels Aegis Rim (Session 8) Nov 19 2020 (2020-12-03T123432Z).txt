[0:07:31] <%gatorafan> I haven't watched a single Vtuber stuff daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:07:34] <%Irridium> based Geoff
[0:07:37] <+b_aleph> @BallerSwagBro9k just get a black brogue and get the toes painted silver
[0:07:45] <@akuda_bar> this conversation is aggressively relatable
[0:07:48] <SenorDose> cringe take geoff
[0:08:15] <%jiggy_snipe> would you refund an mp3?
[0:08:22] <MyNameIsRasus> WOULD YOU DOWNLOAD A CAR
[0:08:30] <%Jack8274> YES
[0:08:32] <+skyheys> not if the tutorial is 5 hours
[0:08:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[0:08:34] <MyNameIsRasus> ME TOO
[0:08:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 2 hours isn't enough to know tho
[0:08:39] <+cvp5127> cant you refund a license?
[0:08:40] <Harro8> Because they can resell your physical copy
[0:08:40] <%gatorafan> I would download RAM if I could daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:08:59] <%Irridium> remember when Skyrim PS3 completely shit its ass after like 80 hours and became legit unplayable
[0:09:02] <%jiggy_snipe> 2 hours probably isn't enough tbf especially when you account for computer issues
[0:09:03] <Harro8> They don't gain anything from letting you refund your digital
[0:09:09] <SenorDose> I would star trek replicator everything if i could
[0:09:10] <+skyheys> some games are made way too long just to cockblock that shit
[0:09:14] <CappuccinoGuil> The difference is Refunds come out of the dev's pocket, chat
[0:09:16] <+Standard_Enemy> Game genres are so varied too. Like 2 hours in a fighting game is way different from 2 hours in a long rpg
[0:09:16] <Harro8> Ohh
[0:09:44] <MyNameIsRasus> In the first hours of P5 you haven't even got to the Palace yet
[0:10:03] <%gatorafan> I missed my chance to refund Age of Empires III DE because I spent like 3 hours building decks before even playing the game daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:10:07] <@akuda_bar> you ate the burger
[0:10:07] <%RyTYoung> You can't return a half drunken can of coke
[0:10:10] <%gatorafan> I deserve it daedra1CryingTibs
[0:10:11] <+skyheys> that's fair, which is why 2 hours is a bad call. some games are 90 minutes
[0:10:17] <CappuccinoGuil> If you go to Gamestop and get credit, the developer doesn't lose money, and too many players refund indies that are 2 hours long
[0:10:18] <+skyheys> some are 500 hours
[0:10:20] <@akuda_bar> you complained there was a hair in your burger but you ate the burger
[0:10:23] <Harro8> makes sense. Can't return a meal i ate
[0:10:23] <%jiggy_snipe> well you can't refund physical stuff once it's open except for a couple stores
[0:10:35] <%Seancicle> maybe
[0:10:46] <%Seancicle> woolieCHAN
[0:10:47] <+Standard_Enemy> I feel like allowing the devs to choose a refund timeframe is a good compromise.
[0:10:57] <+skyheys> 2 hours seriously isnt enough for games like P5 and Coldsteel
[0:11:05] <Althallos> Dragon Quest 11 demo on Switch being 10 hours was such a good deal
[0:11:12] <+ramenpoweredemo> frfr
[0:11:19] <+skyheys> You dont even get to play the damn game on those two
[0:11:19] <SenorDose> 2 hours sounds enough to know if you'll be invested or not
[0:11:20] <%jiggy_snipe> yea dev/pub determined refund period would be a good compromise
[0:11:21] <jorniev> TIME FOR YAKISOBA PAN
[0:11:26] <MyNameIsRasus> @Standard_Enemy as long as steam sets a minimum tho, because that could get abused really bad
[0:11:33] <pixel_river> atleast you support a dev you may like
[0:11:45] <%Terrarp> 2 hrs should be enough to refund no questions asked
[0:11:52] <+Standard_Enemy> Oh for sure @MyNameIsRasus lol watch people be like "5 minutes or no refund"
[0:12:01] <%jiggy_snipe> buying a tv for the super bowl Kappa and returning it after
[0:12:01] <%Terrarp> more than 2 it needs some eyes
[0:12:13] <CappuccinoGuil> I would love to see the refund chart on AAA vs Indie games, how many people those?
[0:12:28] <SenorDose> or just watch some gameplay before purchasing. its not hard to know whether or not you'll like a game
[0:12:28] <MyNameIsRasus> @Standard_Enemy EA be like "FIVE SEC RULE"
[0:12:32] <@akuda_bar> i walked out of aquaman
[0:12:33] <+skyheys> the movie isnt 140 hours woolieMINHMAX
[0:12:34] <+Standard_Enemy> LUL
[0:12:36] <%arancet> "i hates my meal" "but you ate the whole thing"
[0:12:36] <@akuda_bar> what an awful movie
[0:13:01] <%Jack8274> I've seen a mom and kids yell at the poor teen for a refund at an AMC before. She got it lol
[0:13:03] <+ramenpoweredemo> I want my money back for the time i wasted
[0:13:12] <%Irridium> I walked out of Meet the Spartans, got a refund, and still felt like I got ripped off
[0:13:49] <+skyheys> That steak is THE SIZE OF MY HOURSE
[0:13:57] <%Terrarp> I wanted a refund after Star Wars 9 yet I stayed and hated every second of it
[0:14:02] <%Jack8274> IT WAS JUST SUCULENT CHINESE MEAL!
[0:14:03] <Althallos> @SenorDose only watching gameplay doesn't give you a feel for it though. I might love the way a fighting game looks but hate the feel of it
[0:14:04] <%Razputin217> Like that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High
[0:14:08] <%jiggy_snipe> those people are unreasonable and should be ignored
[0:14:12] <jorniev> HEY youtube plaque
[0:14:16] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> YO WOOLIE, THE BANDANA LOOKS GOOD
[0:14:31] <+skyheys> carts could do that and stores didnt check your save anyway
[0:14:40] <CappuccinoGuil> I've seen so many "Good game, wait for it to be on sale because it's too expensive" on games that are 10-20 bucks. It's wild.
[0:14:45] <+ramenpoweredemo> i dont wanna deal with refund hassles so I just get all my games digital lol
[0:14:53] <jorniev> BALLS ON STREAM system
[0:14:55] <%Terrarp> Psn refunds are bullshit, they might as well not exist
[0:14:57] <SenorDose> @Althallos idk man. for me at least having played games for over 20 years, I just know when I see it
