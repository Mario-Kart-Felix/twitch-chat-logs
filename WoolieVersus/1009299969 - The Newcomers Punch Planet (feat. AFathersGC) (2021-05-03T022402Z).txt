[0:21:06] <%PP_Willpower> nah agent just has air normals
[0:21:16] <%justmildlilac> I can see it, yeah
[0:21:54] <%PP_Willpower> juggle system is confusing higher value = more things will hit, hits make it go down
[0:22:31] <dds333a> You're at a disadvantage against the wall, as you'd expect
[0:22:57] <dds333a> Then again, some characters can in fitegames can work with it
[0:23:23] <%CalderGaming> why is agent g's walk cycle so sexy

[0:24:34] <%PP_Willpower> fake -> throw, fake -> low
[0:24:37] <dds333a> we got feints
[0:25:24] <leith_aziz> Reading the opponent gets way easier once you get comftorable with the game
[0:25:48] <+Mrbaconator> messy guessies
[0:25:57] <dds333a> Eventually, some calls come on reaction.
[0:26:03] <leith_aziz> We call it the "neutral"

[0:54:03] <%justmildlilac> @pp_willpower Does Agent have Akuma level HP, or is he more tanky than that?
[0:54:23] <%PP_Willpower> these two characters have the lowest health in the game
[0:54:32] <%justmildlilac> Ah, gotcha
[0:54:32] <dds333a> Good stuff
[0:55:59] <dds333a> Usually, at least :(
[0:56:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:56:09] <%PP_Willpower> depends on the balance of the character but some are just expected to take more hits
[0:56:26] <%PP_Willpower> tyara has the most

[1:00:00] <T_Sasquatch> who is speaking ?
[1:00:00] <Strtfghtr88> dtc vs special cancel
[1:00:05] <%justmildlilac> Say "combo into fireball"
[1:00:12] <%justmildlilac> Instead of cancel
[1:00:16] <%justmildlilac> imo
[1:00:20] <+RealPT1> call it an animation cancel
[1:00:23] <Strtfghtr88> that's a special cancel
