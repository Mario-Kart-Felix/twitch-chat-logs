[0:33:54] <%ozmon> A voice actress acting like someone acting like they're crying
[0:33:59] <usotaku013666> Learn to Ninja
[0:34:01] <dukenux> this whole game is very AC
[0:34:03] <42nfl19> @WoolieVersus Heads up, apparently the lip sync is off cause this was originally recorded in English first.
[0:34:03] <+JingKaisean> Sekiro 2: Electric Boogaloo
[0:34:04] <VerpeiltVerpixelt> I'm already forgiving this game the forced eng lip syncing, as the japanese voice actors REALLY do a great job *__*
[0:34:09] <KeroKamina> the Assassin's Creed Japan we've all been waitign for
[0:34:10] <+LeaIsChill> Oh Minh is in in
[0:34:11] <VidulaSaix> (Angry intake of breath) LUL
[0:34:11] <cacophanes> angry intake of breath
[0:34:14] <+ohzassy> Im just sayin', brudda! Dese Japanese need a little direction!
[0:34:14] <%Javaa01> Or more specifically, even closer to modern Splinter Cell
[0:34:15] <+BaronVonWolfe> Aaaaand favorite character right away. What a bad bitch.
[0:34:15] <%johnny_gogo> better AC
[0:34:16] <mdmzerop> that crouch walk animation is kind of jank
[0:34:17] <GenericTwitchAcc1> (angry intake of breath)
[0:34:17] <%chiazam> This game is more Assassin's Creed than Assassin's Creed now
[0:34:19] <Prevot> this is the Japan AC Ubisoft refused to make
[0:34:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Assassins Creed but good
[0:34:21] <gag5y> it's fuckin stealthier than AC Valhalla
[0:34:28] <VidulaSaix> Chotto matte
[0:34:32] <%DesDavis> @42nfl19 they know
[0:34:33] <dukenux> The only Assassin's Creed: Japan you'll get Kappa
[0:34:33] <cipher758> kill all them mongols bruddah
[0:34:35] <T_Sasquatch> Its like sekiro assassin's creed imo
[0:34:38] <%johnny_gogo> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh Very true
[0:34:38] <%ChoculaUltra> welp, that saves me some cash
[0:34:43] <mexicansunglasses> this is as boring as ass creed tho.
[0:34:52] <+solzan2000> I don't agree
[0:34:58] <%JohnAtDawn> KANEDA
[0:34:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> TETSUOOOOO!
[0:35:02] <spidervenomized> @gag5y almost every game is more assassin creed now
[0:35:02] <%chiazam> It's not all stealth missions
[0:35:02] <slix3431> Castle Canada
[0:35:04] <VidulaSaix> 15 minutes into a game and chat "THIS IS BORING"
[0:35:05] <+Arkfyre> @gag5y nice comparison to a game that's not even out yet
[0:35:07] <%doomerskeletor13> CANADA
[0:35:07] <%mechslayer71> @mexicansunglasses Based off of 15 minutes?
[0:35:10] <Meltgar> Maybe because it's the prologue? lytSORRYPAL

[0:35:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> Prologue?? more like SNORElogue Kappa
[0:35:44] <gag5y> @Arkfyre have you seen the 30 minute gameplay trailer all they showed is shouting while raiding and also YOU CAN STSCK ROCKS
[0:35:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @ianrspc he had a poll, we voted for japanese so who cares.

[0:35:53] <%eyezehuhh> Chat is being invaded by woolieONEGUY s
[0:35:54] <VidulaSaix> The JP cast are all very good actors but I don't feel it fits at all for the game.
[0:35:55] <GenericTwitchAcc1> but muh huhun tho BibleThump
[0:35:57] <Flare3500> F
[0:36:02] <Pharamos> Hi Woolie!
[0:36:02] <%allups> thy lips might not match but least the emotional reading of the lines still carry over and the expressions seem to match.
[0:36:09] <derap41> Its both
[0:36:09] <gag5y> Also my uncle works for Ubisoft
[0:36:11] <+tuchpi> bitches in chat salty about not being able to minimize LUL
[0:36:12] <Setaro> Looks so pretty :O
[0:36:14] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[0:36:15] <spidervenomized> you determine
[0:36:16] <halfmasks> i saved u cause i need your help b-baka
[0:36:21] <%chiazam> yeah sometimes
[0:36:23] <Riorii> i think its a big thing that you decide that yourself
[0:36:27] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s your choice most of the time
[0:36:28] <+Double_Tap_That> According to the talks about the games development, it's up to you.
[0:36:29] <%mechslayer71> You determine for a good bit of it
[0:36:30] <Shishi1205> That animation looks strange to say the least
[0:36:31] <shadow_ninja_83> Wasssup
[0:36:32] <42nfl19> Jito the game is called sneaky ghost stab stab not For Honor
[0:36:37] <Hammatime8> R2 is an odd interact button, but okay
[0:36:38] <TheDr0t> just wait for THAT moment in tutorial
[0:36:41] <Shishi1205> That's not how you squeezed through things
[0:36:42] <JetpackMcQuack> pick your samurai
[0:36:44] <%chiazam> The game will force you into stealth and non-stealth missions
[0:36:44] <dukenux> yeah the lip sync is prolly the biggest flaw so far
[0:36:49] <Flare3500> It's the tutorial so it's probably giving your bearing for now
[0:36:56] <%StaceMcGate> Will Woolie be honorable or dishonorable Samurai?
[0:36:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> who cares about the lip sybc
[0:36:59] <xbb1024> level up your character how you want
[0:37:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> &sync
[0:37:03] <Rigid_Iguana> most likely just a fail state right
[0:37:03] <%Javaa01> If you get spotted NOW, you game over
[0:37:03] <skewerstar> I wonder if there's gonna be a bit where you're crawling and someone above you stabs the ground and narrowly misses you?
[0:37:05] <sileo_patronus> Probably instant fail
[0:37:09] <%Javaa01> Because this mission is scipted
[0:37:17] <slix3431> @StaceMcGate He's not 10 mins in and he is already lying
[0:37:20] <Shishi1205> God they are garbage guards
[0:37:20] <%doomerskeletor13> This is one of the few wholly stealth sectioned
[0:37:30] <skewerstar> PUNCH THE MONGOLS!
[0:37:31] <%saraizarai> So far this very similar ot the start of Sekiro
[0:37:31] <Riorii> how incredible would it be if there are consecouenses to the story depending on your playstyle, with the code and all
[0:37:33] <LeBlanc233> very pretty
[0:37:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:37:36] <dukenux> it matters if youre going for a "cinematic" game, thats a highkey homage to Kurosawa

[0:41:04] <Nekros4442> There is no hard lock
[0:41:04] <%doomerskeletor13> @flare3500 That’s a good point, didn’t even think of that
[0:41:04] <%johnny_gogo> Nope
[0:41:05] <VidulaSaix> There is no lockon
[0:41:05] <sileo_patronus> Correct
[0:41:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Boomer" means anyone 30+ and "zoomer" an anyone below 20
[0:41:05] <%allups> nope
[0:41:07] <%CursedNobleman> RAN is the best Kurosawa film
[0:41:08] <stevo_scar> There's no lock on mechanic

[0:41:17] <Th3rd3> no lock-on huh?
[0:41:18] <%TheOneBirdGuy> No lock is pretty weird
[0:41:18] <dukenux> i dont think its lock on based

[0:41:43] <%Livelinne> Kurosawa's Dream was interesting
[0:41:45] <%saraizarai> I'm not sure I like "the weight" behind attacks. They seem significantly too light. Like play fighting, not actual fighting
[0:41:45] <%doomerskeletor13> You lock on to whoever you’re nearest to
[0:41:49] <%johnny_gogo> gotta fight like a big strong coward
[0:41:50] <Flare3500> Lock on is considered dishonorable
[0:41:50] <ianrspc> just play the game, they'll tell you everything as you go
[0:41:56] <Riorii> you will figure it out when there are multiple enemies
[0:41:56] <Daxalog> lockon is dishonourable and for scrubs which i am not
[0:41:58] <NotHereToStream> GUN
[0:41:59] <+CptBritches> DISHONORABRU

[1:35:03] <%Balkespower> SAMURAI CREED
[1:35:10] <VidulaSaix> You're in a mission now so if you go too far you'll fail
[1:35:17] <Meltgar> SHE JINXED IT LUL
[1:35:25] <@akuda_bar> do you think zoro got lost all the time because he could only navigate when there was wind pointing him around
[1:35:25] <thetrashman_sc> Kyodai
[1:35:28] <Hideow> God the voice acting is incredible
[1:35:30] <jorniev> ZORO
[1:35:33] <BlackermanZX> I like Zoro's VA
[1:35:36] <DeltaD36> These Va sound familiar
[1:35:39] <+froduck42> And Mugen
[1:35:40] <%jetjagger222> i can't unhear zoro now
[1:35:41] <@akuda_bar> this is Zoro's VA
[1:35:44] <jorniev> HOW IS THE GAME WOOLIE!?
[1:35:46] <Flare3500> I'm just waiting for him to shout SANTORYU !!
[1:35:51] <+Sernious> lol zoro got lost and ended up in this game
[1:35:51] <mudapersona> ZORO!?!
[1:35:54] <+wunp_fxs> Daaaamn that sky is pretty
[1:35:55] <%Pillagius> wait a sec... Chracter's seiyuu is Kazuya Nakai? Or I'm just hearing things?
[1:35:59] <Shishi1205> Im pretty sure zoro getting lost is bc of his swords curse
[1:36:05] <+luftraumm1> vagabond is cool and all but historic musashi and the niten ichi ryu sword style is way more awesome and real
[1:36:06] <Prevot> Im not buying this until they announce santoryu DLC
[1:36:06] <%Pillagius> OK... I'm not crazy :D
[1:36:07] <Shishi1205> Preloguetown he didnt get lost
[1:36:11] <jorniev> ZORO VA
[1:36:18] <%eyezehuhh> She talking him up
[1:36:31] <+phatmac16> don't think Zoro's VA fits this character, but it's still cool
[1:36:32] <bustawof> when does jin learn 6 sword style and shouts lets party
[1:36:33] <+MrRanseur> he totally did in Usopps island tho
[1:36:34] <+luftraumm1> niten ichi ryu takes a lot of Inspiration from taike players
[1:36:36] <Flare3500> Youre in a middle quest right now I think
[1:36:41] <Shishi1205> Sandai kitetsu

[1:37:02] <%MacabreOpus> Why is a blacksmith consistently the coolest character in any medium?
[1:37:03] <%Pillagius> @Sernious well, considering that anime series is curently in wano kuni - this fits perfectly :D
