[0:08:05] <%robosqueeb> quantic dream is just david cages stand
[0:08:08] <%holydeviant1> Leaping at woolie like a fucking xenomorph
[0:08:09] <youngking_kush> It's like Peter Griffin & the Chicken lmao
[0:08:10] <+kevlarkoala> Woolie's not even sick, David Cage just snuck something into his drink
[0:08:11] <%brisk_dacat> Wear a ski mask to work for protection
[0:08:11] <slackerunchained> Literal Cage Match.
[0:08:13] <%DashXero> But you sold so many copies of his terrible games.
[0:08:17] <legacy0117> Lol.
[0:08:18] <+Stupid121v2> quantic shooters in the streets
[0:08:19] <Ashenik1> didnt Reggie like heavy Rain though? Kappa
[0:08:22] <+kevlarkoala> Woolie got exposed to radioactive Cage material
[0:08:26] <+eanscrale> when they said the cage match of the century, this was not what I was expecting.
[0:08:27] <hawmaro95> Woolie starts playing footsies with david cage
[0:08:31] <%ronin19xx> I legitimately put on the Omikron LP as ASMR for me to go to sleep
[0:08:35] <%robosqueeb> i cant wait to see the sith sitting at the back of the bus
[0:08:37] <Pede2011> I mean, cringe is an emotion
[0:08:43] <Ashenik1> by emotions, he meant cringe
[0:08:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> Emoshuns brand bullets
[0:08:46] <fatsausagedoggo> Like stand users, drawn together
[0:08:56] <miucsa51> I made ze bad game
[0:08:57] <KellBeII> Hey Woolie, what software are you using to keep cheaters out of reggies game?
[0:09:02] <GHouseduivel> How is David Cage even real?
[0:09:03] <brunoberserk> BAHGOD ! David CAge is coming qith a steel chair !
[0:09:03] <%leith_aziz> I guess if I can congratulate David Cage for soemthing, he makes me feel better about being invested in something like Guilty Gear or JoJo's plot
[0:09:11] <%robosqueeb> memories of shitting dick-nipples
[0:09:13] <%CateHecate> unironically getting shot by david cage might be the funniest conclusion to the old channels' long running character arc with him LUL
[0:09:16] <slipdog> the genius behind a shitting dick and balls What this English does mean ?
[0:09:27] <leith_aziz> Allthough that wont stop people from memeing either from time to time
[0:09:36] <+froduck42> I blame Jessie Cox
[0:09:37] <+Mkingston> Cage match
[0:09:47] <slackerunchained> It then turns out that David Cage was the guy Woolie killed.
[0:09:48] <%CateHecate> "david cage is actually similar to kojima"- woolie woolz 2021
[0:09:55] <%ronin19xx> SAN.D
[0:10:06] <Jickiechan> I can't wait for david cage's awkward wookie naked shower scene
[0:10:10] <%RyTYoung> Next Kojima game is gonna be a left field cutesy kids game Kappa
[0:10:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> @CateHecate He's a visionary, he just needs glasses LUL
[0:10:16] <+Mkingston> like A New Hope
[0:10:24] <%leith_aziz> I will give credit to Hank and Connor. That shit was legit great...allthough Cage had no part in that
[0:10:25] <%CateHecate> its like if star wars got made in order of numbers

[0:10:52] <+ThomasOfTroy> The best thing that could happen to Quantic Dream is if David Cage is kicked from it. It'd probably become one of the best devs out there imo
[0:10:53] <+Mkingston> but at least Kojima is fun
[0:10:55] <delightmare_> the scent of cage, shiny perfume for a merry christmas
[0:10:56] <+Dova573> Hank is great cuase Clancy brown is great
[0:10:56] <Pede2011> If it has underage creepy stuff, rape and/or weird sex, probably Cage
[0:10:57] <slackerunchained> Just watch to see if the Star Wars game has an unusual number of shower and sexual-assault scenes.

[0:11:38] <%CateHecate> thats because there actually are switches that exist
[0:11:41] <AnonymousNate_> Much more interested in the Telltale Star Trek game... The Expanse I think it's called
[0:11:46] <%swesterly> For every crawling through the robot graveyard scene there are 3 inappropriate social issues scenes
[0:11:47] <AngryAsian5> Man, I personally wouldn't mind a QD game without Cage. We'll finally get to know once and for all if it is just him screwing the pot.
[0:11:48] <miucsa51> for 35 month the Switch has being the best selling console
[0:11:51] <+mikehuntis4timmy> didnt the switch sales pretty much double from start of covid till niw?
[0:11:57] <%zanz_san> Scalping scum
[0:12:06] <@Menitta> The Wii U in November 2014 outsold both the Xbox and PS5 for this November
[0:12:08] <slackerunchained> The Jedi guy uses the Force to possess a guy, psychically, and then cuck him with his wife with his own dick.
[0:12:08] <+Dova573> Im so glad I was able to get mine, and at a discount
[0:12:10] <%RyTYoung> People making $2M of scalping
[0:12:10] <%X2Eliah> this is new
[0:12:11] <gameshark45> the worst it's EVER been
[0:12:11] <@Menitta> the WII U
[0:12:12] <+Stupid121v2> It never lasts a year
[0:12:13] <youngking_kush> Easily
[0:12:14] <%CateHecate> not for this long
[0:12:19] <%leith_aziz> Covid + PS5 rareity
[0:12:21] <+kevlarkoala> everybody forgot that this is not common because of Nintendo's previous shortage issues
[0:12:22] <%amaranthos> PS3 and PS4 were super available
[0:12:23] <KellBeII> PS3 was pretty bad
[0:12:24] <%Vigonept> not this long
[0:12:27] <%amaranthos> Ps3 was even a meme at launch
[0:12:31] <slipdog> it never lasted over like 3 months though
[0:12:34] <%leith_aziz> Allthough PS3 was EXPESNSIVE
[0:12:37] <%Irridium> it's always hard but gets better after a few months
[0:12:39] <+charp35> i've never had a problem getting one withing a couple months of launch, getting a ps5 took an entire year for me
[0:12:39] <@Menitta> PS4 became available by January
[0:12:40] <+kevlarkoala> but you could always walk into a store and just grab a PS3/4 or 360/Xbone
[0:12:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't wait for semiconductor production to get back to normal 3 years from now
[0:12:45] <%leith_aziz> I bought a cheap one, but it had like 17 GB only
[0:12:48] <SilverFaustX> i have seen 1 ps5 in 2 yrs
[0:12:50] <KellBeII> yeah no progress has been made with sony
[0:12:52] <%amaranthos> People complained about PS3 but people are shelling out 700+ for scalped PS5s
[0:12:57] <%leith_aziz> So my game category was extremely limited
[0:12:58] <+Stupid121v2> like 0.5% improvement maybe
[0:13:02] <AnonymousNate_> Yeah things calmed down for the Wii after like a half a year and there are still PS5s selling online for $1000 it's crazy
[0:13:09] <+AcquireCornbread> very true, you could get a ps4 much easier a year after release. not so for the ps5
[0:13:10] <miucsa51> and is not gonna improve until 23 at best
[0:13:10] <%CateHecate> honestly, should i just buy a ps4 for cheap at this point just so i can play bloodborne and p5?
[0:13:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> Usually a year its fine. Shit sucks now
[0:13:12] <%RyTYoung> You can go + a year for waiting on restock of Amiibo, not games consoles csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[0:13:14] <@Solidus_113> five hundred and ninety nine US Dollars
[0:13:28] <SilverFaustX> they only sell bundled ps5's here, sony doesnt want to sell only a ps5
[0:13:32] <%leith_aziz> @CateHecate If you can get a PS5. you can just play PS4 games on it
[0:13:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Takes a long ass time to build factories for chips
[0:13:43] <Pede2011> @CateHecate well, a jailbreak just released yesterday for the PS4, so...
[0:13:51] <@Menitta> Ive seen more bottles of Pappy Van Winkle than PS5s this year
[0:13:57] <@Solidus_113> YO. PRAEY FOR THE GODS 1.0 JUST DROPPED.
[0:13:59] <@Solidus_113> PLAY THAT SHIT
[0:14:05] <slackerunchained> @Pede2011 And it *might* work for the PS5, too.
[0:14:09] <%Deekman> @Solidus_113 Just saw that! I'm so fucking hyped!
[0:14:14] <%leith_aziz> My plan is to stick with my PC and hope Sony exclusive get PC ports. It's happened
[0:14:14] <@Menitta> nobody gets that metric but I do...
[0:14:15] <+AcquireCornbread> such a shame too, this gen of consoles seems really impressive
[0:14:28] <AnonymousNate_> Considering Horizon is still gonna be on PS4 I have no reason to get a PS5 til GOW: Ragnarok
[0:14:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Even GPU companies are saying the drought is going well into 2022
[0:14:34] <+Dova573> Man hearing that the ps4 is jailbreaked makes me wonder if i can turn mine into a ps1,2, 3 emulator
[0:14:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's like a triple whammy of them needing high end parts, the chip shortage, and the pandemic

[0:23:59] <Arqartur0> holy shit, a lot of streamers I'm following are playing DS today.
[0:24:01] <AnonymousNate_> I mean from a lore perspective everyone in painted world is innocent. They're just outcasts of the world

[0:24:40] <slackerunchained> @IronOhki Reggie has special dietary requirements...
[0:24:48] <youngking_kush> F for that one lady
[0:24:49] <%xjn_> right? I never thought the boar helm would accessorize so well with channeler robes
[0:24:58] <%Ashenik1> @CateHecate  there is something about it
[0:25:04] <%Bread_Assassin> With Lautrec, swing first.

[0:25:35] <%diegobandzz> Reggie is against religion
[0:25:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Undenizen idk, but im guessing no
[0:25:41] <%Ashenik1> Dark Souls and trying to complete NPC quest LUL
[0:25:45] <atomizedstream> I thought she only gets kidnapped after you buy everything from her did reggie buy them?
[0:25:45] <Johannen> @AnonymousNate_ Actually the opposite is more of a case in DS1, you leave them alone and they kinda stay there)
[0:25:49] <slackerunchained> @Arqartur0 He needs a very high daily SOUL-level.
[0:25:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> don't even ask about her buddies
[0:25:54] <+Jiggisnipe> who was he aiming at?
[0:25:54] <%Ensign_Epic> oh god is Reggie gonna try the Avelyn jump
[0:26:02] <Arqartur0> @slackerunchained OH, I see.
[0:26:21] <BigYanno> I got Avelyn exactly once. It's not worth it
[0:26:24] <youngking_kush> Nope
[0:26:24] <MeImoth> I have never gotten that chest in over 30 runs, because its that annoying
[0:26:25] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus reggie has dropped souls on the way for the crystal cave
[0:26:38] <Arqartur0> too bad there's too much salt in their weekly Dokapon intake.
[0:26:40] <%Ashenik1> What was the best moment of this LP so far?
[0:26:42] <DSD24> I like the crystal armor in this game
[0:26:42] <+POUND_CAKE94> can't get over how good his weapon is
[0:26:47] <DSD24> Looks real nice
[0:26:54] <youngking_kush> You gotta use the turning staircase
[0:27:10] <chambatron> Ohh the mimic
[0:27:18] <slackerunchained> @BigYanno Avelyn is good for inflicting status ailments at a range if you load it with special bolts, like poison or bleeding.
[0:27:30] <AnonymousNate_> You can do some save & quit shenanigans that makes getting the Avelyn way easier

[0:28:46] <+kevlarkoala> best wishes to Plauge btw
[0:28:54] <%Ensign_Epic> Avelyn's good & definitely worth it, but that drop is just a royal asspain, you more or less IMMEDIATELY have to run down the stairs to make the jump
[0:28:54] <%Ashenik1> @kevlarkoala  BUT WHAT IF THOUGH!!!
[0:29:04] <%IronOhki> No one likes those guys.
[0:29:06] <slackerunchained> Reggie could likely make use of a nice Hybrid-catalyst so he could cast without needing to forgoe his shield.

[0:31:55] <%Ensign_Epic> now to deal with the picasa
[0:31:58] <%holydeviant1> Oh god for a second I misread those snakemen as having horse heads.
[0:31:58] <slackerunchained> Tentacle-Waifus...

[0:32:33] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Reggie was like damn that sucks
[0:32:34] <%Vigonept> which girl?
[0:32:34] <%Necnill> Reggie is valid
[0:32:38] <@Menitta> "Oh No! Anyway-"
[0:32:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> dead, huh?
[0:32:39] <AnonymousNate_> I mean in this world it's not surprising when something dies LUL
[0:32:41] <TheRaubvogel> Reggie hates girls
[0:32:45] <youngking_kush> Reggie hates Nuns, confirmed
[0:32:45] <+Jiggisnipe> @Vigonept Rhea
[0:32:47] <jett_eyes> who?
[0:32:49] <%jonblnt> So I managed to buy a PS5 yesterday. just in time for Eldin Ring. follow Wario64, turn on notifications, have accounts on all the major retailers in order before hand. and pray to black baby Jesus woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:32:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> If it were laurentius, it he might care
[0:32:50] <+xerotwo> SUSUME, REGGARTH!!!
[0:32:52] <jett_eyes> oh
[0:32:53] <%CateHecate> KICK
[0:32:54] <%Ashenik1> NPC aint cool=doesnt deserve to live
[0:32:54] <DSD24> Kick!
[0:33:02] <LunarRemix> God I love Pyromancy
[0:33:15] <%BignanasTheGawd> you know reggie, for someone who hates patches, you have a lot in common with him. Like your hate of clerics
[0:33:22] <BigYanno> It's a fantastic humanity farm
[0:33:30] <%paladinstarbuster> emphasis on farm
[0:33:36] <slackerunchained> @BignanasTheGawd ...And his love of kicking things.
[0:33:40] <+shapeforn> Patches is like looking in a mirror for Reggie
[0:33:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> yo is that red magic?
[0:33:45] <jett_eyes> fuckin snake people
[0:33:49] <+Shady_Zaku> I mean we already know Reggie is a confirmed monster so doodScrub
[0:33:49] <DSD24> Don't forget that Nun lady was a jerk
[0:33:51] <+OutOfJambread> That's a nice weapon
[0:33:56] <%Ashenik1> Reggie is literally Patches
[0:34:10] <brunoberserk> you ....... DID IT
[0:34:11] <Ros_Bef> So uncouth
[0:34:15] <%paladinstarbuster> are these snake guys related to the snake guys in ds3?
[0:34:19] <%Ashenik1> you............. DID IT
[0:34:19] <BigYanno> If you're doing a faith build Wrath of the Gods makes farming those things so satisfying
[0:34:29] <%tigerfang86> hes gonna find that ULTIMATE MAGICKA
[0:34:30] <LVL1_Scumbag> Moar magic
[0:34:31] <slackerunchained> @paladinstarbuster Yes, Actually.
[0:34:37] <%IronOhki> Big Magics
[0:34:38] <%Ensign_Epic> WotG makes farming ANYTHING satisfying, tbh
[0:34:43] <+Shady_Zaku> @ashenik1 Pretty much lol
[0:34:44] <%Ashenik1> @paladinstarbuster  where were they?
[0:34:45] <%CateHecate> and nothing will go wrong
[0:34:51] <Equirah> time to bone out
[0:34:58] <youngking_kush> You're gonna wanna quit & reload once you get back to the bonfire
[0:35:04] <Pie_Mastyr> now he sells magic but with 30% more meth
[0:35:04] <slackerunchained> Lotta Fire-Keepers are maidens, too.
[0:35:09] <cheapdoc> @paladinstarbuster tangentially. These ones are probably made by the bitch, the ones in DS3 have more of a monk seeking enlightenment feel
[0:35:14] <%paladinstarbuster> @Ashenik1 dragons peak??
[0:35:23] <DSD24> I thought to be a Fire Keeper you have to be a lady?
[0:35:32] <+vaderxyz1970> add some TANG
[0:35:37] <%IronOhki> I just realized... that soul probably means Seethe imprisoned a fire keeper her specifically to make the trap bonfire in this chamber.
[0:35:37] <+TheFrancix> from sunny D to Fanta
[0:35:38] <dundore77> pour more kool-aid mix into the water
[0:35:43] <%paladinstarbuster> @paladinstarbuster oh that makes sense
[0:35:51] <+Shishi1205> ds3 dragon snake dudes come from looking for the path of the dragon
[0:36:09] <LunarRemix> It resets on warp
[0:36:10] <BigYanno> everything is already reset
[0:36:12] <+TheFrancix> it's retet
[0:36:15] <%Vigonept> on warp
[0:36:16] <+Jiggisnipe> it reset on warp I think
[0:36:19] <Pubstar_LTD> @IronOhki big brain
[0:36:22] <+Jiggisnipe> 10 Estus
[0:36:22] <+TheFrancix> reset*
[0:36:25] <+Shishi1205> Although Oceiros did research logan/seath magic tech
[0:36:25] <%BignanasTheGawd> look at estus
[0:36:38] <%Ashenik1> @paladinstarbuster  they were snakes? ha...
[0:36:42] <+Shady_Zaku> @thefrancix But that's a downgrade doodScrub larrLul
[0:36:56] <youngking_kush> If you quit and reload you can go check out Logan's spells
[0:37:12] <LunarRemix> Logan's just around the corner
[0:37:15] <%Ensign_Epic> Yeah, that Fire Keeper was essentially used to make a trap. And the picasa are Seath's experimentation on maidens
[0:37:34] <%guiltyboya> Don't you hate it when you forget your librairy card, and a bunch of crystal ridden undead come to bust your ass? Happens to me all the time
[0:37:37] <+Shishi1205> yeah logan is right there
[0:37:40] <youngking_kush> Or leave and come back
[0:37:50] <%Ensign_Epic> Pisaca, my apologies
[0:37:57] <%Lion_kun> Save your souls to buy Logans spells
[0:38:15] <%Lion_kun> You need to buy everything he has to complete his quest
[0:38:18] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus behind the shelf leading to the cave, to the little room on the left
[0:38:19] <DSD24> These guys hurt
[0:38:28] <cheapdoc> Save your money for that spellusy
[0:38:32] <%hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus Logan is right near the bonfire. On the way out from the main hall, go into the left room in the room with the big ladder.
[0:38:45] <%Ensign_Epic> He needs to reload the area first
[0:38:48] <cheapdoc> spllusy if you will
[0:38:52] <%Prevot> Logan's in the super dark room
[0:38:52] <%Ensign_Epic> Save & quit is the easiest way to do so
[0:38:56] <youngking_kush> @acenugget This
[0:39:03] <+Shishi1205> load reload shenanigans. Never change dark souls
[0:39:03] <%CateHecate> sitting should reload, shouldnt it?
[0:39:09] <%Ashenik1> is this the first area after O&S for Reggie?
[0:39:16] <DSD24> Is there NO ONE ELSE
[0:39:18] <%Indigo_Automaton> Almost a 1-hit two handed
[0:39:19] <%CateHecate> loooong after o+s
[0:39:21] <youngking_kush> Nah, sitting is not enough
[0:39:26] <+Shishi1205> @Ashenik1 for golden areas? yes
[0:39:41] <ExpressNode> Havent seen the dark souls streams in a while but we playing Nioh now?
[0:39:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:39:42] <bobxmaker> @Ashenik1 he did four kings before this
[0:39:43] <+kevlarkoala> for this in specific, save and reload is the only way to guarantee it. which sucks but yeah
[0:39:44] <%Ensign_Epic> @CateHecate No, sitting at a bonfire does not reload the area. It resets enemies, this is different from reloading
[0:39:44] <%brandt_connors> has he tried to get the Avelyn?
[0:39:56] <BlueEagle2395> Reggie wants the level doe so forget about that guys, he'll find logan eventually
[0:40:05] <Equirah> @brandt_connors not yet
[0:40:06] <%Lion_kun> Reggie don't waste the souls for a level. Use them to buy Logans spells
[0:40:09] <%DashXero> I was like, "He's just gonna let that guy chill?"
[0:40:14] <+Shishi1205> the same way lizards dont respawn if you sit in the bonfire
[0:40:24] <+Shishi1205> you need to quit and reload
[0:40:27] <%Ensign_Epic> Basically sitting at a bonfire doesn't reload the area, it resets the area. Reloading requires a loading screen.
[0:40:27] <%Ashenik1> @bobxmaker  he killed Sif ??? PepeHands
[0:40:32] <+cdrom321> @ashenik1 He already ventured into Tomb of the Giants before, but the gold fog gate was there. After placing the lord vessel, Duke's Archives is his first.
[0:40:54] <%Ashenik1> @cdrom321  thx
[0:41:05] <bobxmaker> @Ashenik1 yes, he killed sif, sad doggo have been put to rest
[0:41:16] <%hax_metatron> Not that room
[0:41:17] <MeImoth> side room
[0:41:18] <%hax_metatron> The other room
[0:41:19] <%hax_metatron> Side room
[0:41:21] <Nevarato> @ensign_epic he used a bone...
[0:41:22] <LunarRemix> He's on the side room
[0:41:23] <Equirah> other room
[0:41:24] <%Ashenik1> @bobxmaker  bad ending PepeHands
[0:41:29] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its the left room before this
[0:41:31] <hawmaro95> other room
[0:41:36] <%Prevot> the dark room
[0:41:42] <youngking_kush> No, he's in the room on the left
[0:41:45] <%hax_metatron> Side room before he enters the mimic room
[0:41:46] <tachi_gigas> to the left at the beginning of the room
[0:41:49] <DSD24> Be wary of this pear
[0:42:04] <+cdrom321> @ashenik1 He killed Sif too quickly to see the sadness. He then placed the lord vessel via Kaathe.
[0:42:07] <%Ensign_Epic> There he is
[0:42:16] <@Menitta> general kenobi
[0:42:18] <%hax_metatron> I love that he looks like furniture here, with his big ass hat LUL
[0:42:19] <+Shishi1205> crystal time
[0:42:22] <tachi_gigas> PogChamp  Logan is pogging
[0:42:23] <%Ashenik1> @cdrom321  :c
[0:42:37] <%Ensign_Epic> Time to get some nukes.
[0:42:45] <%CateHecate> What does this mean? NEVER EXPLAINED
[0:42:46] <daswampken> big secrets
[0:42:47] <DSD24> His wounds will not heal
[0:42:49] <deeriojim> hello, I see Reggie has found big hat again

[0:43:25] <%theoldone001> We even got this crystal shit that makes us double immortal for some reason, don't even needt it!
[0:43:26] <drunken_lemur> @tigerfang86 LUL LUL
[0:43:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> fancy
[0:43:29] <%Ensign_Epic> Good on Reggie going for the talk dialogue. This is how you're SUPPOSED to discover how to beat Seath.
[0:43:36] <+cdrom321> @tigerfang86 Don't even need it.
[0:43:43] <Ros_Bef> @deeriojim remastered lighting
[0:43:44] <Parapattern> "This truly is the high life."
[0:43:49] <drunken_lemur> @MrATheGreat "Can I do that again?"
[0:43:51] <%CateHecate> unlike me, of course
[0:43:52] <%tigerfang86> Some would say seath was a crazy weirdo
[0:43:56] <%tigerfang86> but nah, he and I, we're tight
[0:44:04] <Pubstar_LTD> @Ensign_Epic this is why I love this playthrough
[0:44:04] <cheapdoc> Seath? Fixation? never, dude seems totally detached ...
[0:44:09] <LVL1_Scumbag> Seath was really butthurt about being mortal before mortality existed
[0:44:12] <+Shishi1205> but he is abitch master logan
[0:44:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> the entirety of one piece
[0:44:19] <goddesstabrasa> I really hope Reggie is able to find and aquire the moonlight greatsword. I think it would go great with his build. if anything at least a secondary weapon
[0:44:19] <+Shishi1205> he is a legless biiiiiitch
[0:44:33] <deeriojim> soul spear is cool
[0:44:34] <%Ensign_Epic> Ladies and gentlemen, Seath cannot be a bitch, for Seath FUCKS.
[0:44:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Logan looking up to a scaleless bitch...
[0:44:42] <youngking_kush> Time for BIG BOY SPELLS
[0:44:44] <+TheFrancix> SOUL SPEAR BOIS
[0:44:45] <DSD24> Soul Spear is so cool
[0:44:49] <%Ashenik1> why is Seath a bitch?
[0:44:49] <KyberNasse> Logan being the ermahgerd book girl meme
[0:44:52] <%Lion_kun> Soul spear fucks
[0:44:54] <+Shishi1205> keep looking at the spells
[0:44:55] <Equirah> there was mor reggie
[0:44:55] <%hax_metatron> DAT CRYSTAL SOUL SPEAR THO
[0:44:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> cost or some say costm
[0:45:01] <MeImoth> lol didn't even read all the spells
[0:45:03] <%Ensign_Epic> Soul Spear does indeed fuck
[0:45:09] <$eco419> PridePog
[0:45:12] <deeriojim> the dark lighting kind of takes away from you not seeing all the bookshelves
[0:45:13] <%Ensign_Epic> Fucks people up, very badly. Good spell.
[0:45:14] <youngking_kush> Soul Spear carries thr rest of the game lol
[0:45:15] <OblivionSword1> buy it now and level later
[0:45:27] <DSD24> Because Seathe is a huge race traitor
[0:45:33] <Equirah> browse his wares LUL
[0:45:34] <+Shishi1205> Reggie did you even see the new crystal spells?
[0:45:36] <legacy0117> Soul Spear destroys, from what I’ve seen in other playthrough a.
[0:45:43] <%Lion_kun> Then you get crystal soul spear that really fucks
[0:45:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> He did
[0:45:46] <%Visorak6> ???
[0:45:46] <LunarRemix> He has.
[0:45:53] <%hax_metatron> Reggie, you didn't check his whole inventory lul
[0:45:54] <%Ensign_Epic> Crystal Soul Spear is sex incarnate.
[0:45:58] <Mundkipz> i think he gets better spells after seath
[0:46:00] <MeImoth> He does have something more, Reggie didn't even look at the entire thing LUL
[0:46:01] <%hax_metatron> Reggie, you missed half his spells bro
[0:46:02] <cs0402196> crystal fucks regular soul spear
[0:46:03] <%theoldone001> Seath and Woolie aren't very far apart morally. They'd both betray their own.
[0:46:03] <LunarRemix> Crystal spells are fucking nukes
[0:46:04] <deeriojim> soul spear is how I beat Gwyn on my first run
[0:46:05] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> Why not kill the Mimic? It gives souls as well.
[0:46:14] <%Ensign_Epic> @Mundkipz I think he gets White Dragon Breath, yeah
[0:46:14] <cheapdoc> Most of it is a variation of Magic Missile TBH
[0:46:14] <%hax_metatron> Get those crystal spells
[0:46:17] <%Ashenik1> @DSD24  well, he aint the race suppremacist at least
[0:46:21] <legacy0117> Oh yeah Crystal Soul Spear is a thing too.
[0:46:25] <+vaderxyz1970> Crystal souls spear is a ground to ground missle
[0:46:25] <SilverFaustX> lol
[0:46:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:46:32] <DSD24> @Ashenik1 I'll give him that at least

[0:46:42] <+SilverDevilfish> "You run around with boar helm and hit things with a stick. Are you a warrior?" "I'm a mage" "O-Oh."
[0:46:45] <+Shishi1205> woolie make sure he reads all of the spells
[0:46:47] <ChoculaUltra> digging the pants
[0:46:53] <Iwashi94> Hello There
[0:46:53] <DSD24> @Ashenik1 Plus I'm pretty sure he was hated by dragons himself so I get it
[0:46:59] <%CateHecate> Seath used his advanced crystal theory to determine that other dragons were inferior due to their skull shape
[0:47:08] <deeriojim> @SilverDevilfish Caveman? no, Cavemage!
[0:47:21] <squidmax1> Oh hell yeah soulmass
[0:47:24] <+Shishi1205> the best one
[0:47:28] <happy_void> that spear is the one to get
[0:47:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> never tried a homing spell
[0:47:30] <cheapdoc> Imagine if cigarettes gave you a bonus to item discovery
[0:47:33] <velgaduere> that is the thing
[0:47:33] <MeImoth> HOMING CRYSTAL SOULMASS is very good for hybrid builds
[0:47:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> THAT's the actual new shit
[0:47:37] <velgaduere> get that thing
[0:47:47] <%Ensign_Epic> Is there a better sorcery in the series than DS1 CSS? Maybe Pursuers?
[0:47:57] <%Visorak6> dark bead
[0:47:57] <youngking_kush> Magic on Crack
[0:48:00] <%Indigo_Automaton> IT is
[0:48:01] <happy_void> that's a good one too
[0:48:06] <LunarRemix> This KILLS people on PvP
[0:48:09] <%tigerfang86> hmmm
[0:48:12] <%hax_metatron> "Win the game" spell
[0:48:13] <legacy0117> Homing Soul mass murders other players and other humanoids.
[0:48:13] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus he thinks it tunrs his weapon into a crystal weapon, it's a way better magic weapon
[0:48:14] <+Shishi1205> PvP spell
[0:48:14] <LunarRemix> Like One shot
[0:48:14] <+vaderxyz1970> Become a machine gun
[0:48:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> i know that it hurts me
[0:48:16] <tolloponik> this spell requires a phd to use
[0:48:21] <%tigerfang86> ON PAR WITH THE GODS
[0:48:21] <+Ultimate_Edge> Contraband that bullshit spell
[0:48:24] <MeImoth> @Ensign_Epic Dark Bead in DS1, it rips bosses apart even more then CSS
[0:48:26] <youngking_kush> Homing Crystal Soulmass is ba4
[0:48:30] <youngking_kush> bae*
[0:48:31] <%hax_metatron> Homing Crystal Soulmass + Crystal staff + Dusk crown = HAVEL HATES YOU
[0:48:33] <velgaduere> BECOME CRYSTAL REGGIE
[0:48:33] <@Solidus_113> homing crystal soulmass and pursuers. the two spells of FUCK
[0:48:34] <oda_flobunaga> Its too clear to be crystal magic
[0:48:42] <lord_of_the_dragons> L33T M463
[0:48:43] <cheapdoc> FANTASY! The only place where crystals are actually useful for something
[0:48:50] <velgaduere> just recall the power of the Crystal Stars, Reggio
[0:48:51] <slackerunchained> GODS I WAS WELL-SCALED, THEN.
[0:48:54] <LunarRemix> They're legit nukes
[0:48:56] <Arqartur0> for a moment I heard crystal skulls, and those are rad
[0:48:57] <+Shishi1205> crystalk
[0:48:58] <MeImoth> HCS is very good
[0:49:00] <%Lion_kun> Wait till Reggie gets to the DLC spells
[0:49:00] <Johannen> If only we didnt spent all those points on uselss strenght
[0:49:01] <brunoberserk> so i just watched  the trailer of the new nic cage film , is about Nic Cage being Nic Cage ... thats the plot, i not joking
[0:49:02] <squidmax1> Come on soul mass
[0:49:13] <%CateHecate> dats a lotta damage
[0:49:14] <Pubstar_LTD> 10 uses vs 4 uses tho
[0:49:20] <%Ashenik1> @DSD24 he betrayed his race for Jetpack
[0:49:21] <DSD24> @brunoberserk Oh is it like a documentary?
[0:49:22] <Ros_Bef> Team soul mass
[0:49:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> 44 haha
[0:49:30] <+Shishi1205> they still chunk pve
[0:49:32] <sendart> the homing spells fuck shit up in pve lol
[0:49:32] <skewerstar> DS2's Soul Geyser is pretty dope!
[0:49:34] <%jonblnt> @brunoberserk legitimately sounds great
[0:49:35] <Nevarato> soul spearalso pierces
[0:49:37] <AnonymousNate_> Soul Mass is very nice... free damage at the start of each fight
[0:49:37] <LunarRemix> But it's still great on PvE though. You can cast before fighting a tough enemy for free damage
[0:49:38] <brunoberserk> @DSD24 kinda
[0:49:44] <%Ensign_Epic> Really hope Reggie buys Logan out, wanna see the reaction to what happens to Logan
[0:49:45] <slackerunchained> I like Ice spells in 3.
[0:49:47] <%Lion_kun> Logan drops an even stronger spell when you finish his quest.
[0:49:48] <youngking_kush> You can shoot Soul Spear from a far, and it can pierce multiple targets
[0:49:58] <%livlinn> !uptime
[0:49:58] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 1 minute
[0:49:59] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus In PVE it has the advantage of casting before combat and not fusing about
[0:50:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> if you want it
[0:50:03] <DSD24> Soul Spear sounds great
[0:50:08] <youngking_kush> Soul Spear is fast
[0:50:09] <MeImoth> Homing soulmass is very nice for the ability to pre cast it before aggroing enemies
[0:50:13] <SoaringTrumpet> I never used those slow ass heavy soul arrows
[0:50:14] <velgaduere> he's pretty damn close, 8 levels ain't get
[0:50:17] <%hax_metatron> Soul Spear
[0:50:20] <velgaduere> *ain't bad to get
[0:50:21] <sendart> homing spells also have pretty fast cast time
[0:50:30] <%hax_metatron> Soul Spear >>> Soulmass for PVE
[0:50:31] <velgaduere> both
[0:50:32] <Blank9> Crystal magic rules
[0:50:41] <%Ashenik1> from Demons to Sekiro, where was magic the most fun?
[0:50:45] <%Lion_kun> BOTHHHHH
[0:50:50] <Artiamus> Just hopped on. What I miss today?
[0:50:57] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[0:50:58] <derap41> God dammit I'm late
[0:51:06] <AnonymousNate_> @Ashenik1 I would actually say DS2 has the best magic spells
[0:51:11] <MeImoth> at this point going for 44 will need some grinding I am pretty sure
[0:51:11] <+Shishi1205> there you go
[0:51:13] <Ros_Bef> What triggers logan to hollow? Killing seath?
[0:51:14] <sporeian94> Just a heads up Elden Ring is basically fully leaked now thanks to the PS4 patch exploit
[0:51:15] <derap41> Why not both
[0:51:16] <slackerunchained> @Ashenik1 If we count 'guns' as 'magic': Bloodborne.
[0:51:16] <sendart> more ammo
[0:51:16] <Equirah> INDEED
[0:51:18] <%Lion_kun> You can have both
[0:51:20] <LunarRemix> You could always just infuse a normal weapon with magic and switch weapons later on
[0:51:25] <youngking_kush> You need to buy all his spells anyway to complete his quesy
[0:51:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> You can always come back with more money
[0:51:37] <sendart> go full ranged and break the game lol
[0:51:47] <derap41> I like Reggies low Attunement high int build
[0:51:52] <+Shishi1205> pve doesnt like ranged battles
[0:51:58] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Soul Spear is variety and something new
[0:52:03] <+Shishi1205> like really. AI janks a lot ranged
[0:52:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> new spells just dropped
[0:52:23] <%Lion_kun> I always hated wasting levels on attunement
[0:52:26] <%Ashenik1> @slackerunchained  having guns as stats along side with magic or strength, that would be interesting
[0:52:35] <derap41> Its time to do a little grinding off camera
[0:52:38] <DSD24> Yay
[0:52:38] <BlueEagle2395> PogChamp
[0:52:43] <Equirah> @Lion_kun they finally fixed that in ER
[0:52:46] <Crowroost> !uptime
[0:52:46] <@Moobot> @Crowroost WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 4 minutes
[0:52:52] <velgaduere> it DOES
[0:52:57] <+Shishi1205> There's a ring in DS3 convergence that grants 3 attunement slots
[0:52:58] <Johannen> @derap41 They will get a lot of souls in the upcoming crystal caves
[0:53:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at this point souls aren't that hard to come by
[0:53:07] <%IronOhki> Buy them all for sure!
[0:53:15] <sendart> with the dragon ring and special hats can hit stupid damage from really far
[0:53:16] <+KevinsLunchbox> oooh hes in the Dukes Archives
[0:53:18] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, you should eventually buy everything he has.
[0:53:18] <AnonymousNate_> I wouldn't call guns in Bloodborne magic. Guns work more like shields as a parry tool in that game. There's only like 2 offensive guns
[0:53:20] <LunarRemix> Before you compare damage it's worth nothing that *every* enemy on this area is highly resistant to Magic damage
[0:53:20] <youngking_kush> It penetrates multiple enemies
[0:53:31] <KellBeII> sells to spell you
[0:53:32] <%tigerfang86> h m
[0:53:39] <Artiamus> Has he gone down to see the boss yet?
[0:53:48] <DSD24> Having a giggle there
[0:53:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:53:51] <%AceNugget> mimic install
[0:53:55] <%tigerfang86> Mimic having a good time
[0:53:55] <okramv> what armor is this
[0:53:56] <Equirah> @Artiamus no
[0:54:00] <+Shishi1205> whiff punish
[0:54:01] <DSD24> Low profile
[0:54:05] <deeriojim> oooh he nearly got you there
[0:54:08] <%tigerfang86> lewd
[0:54:11] <+xerotwo> ABBADABBADOOKEN!!!
[0:54:11] <velgaduere> trimmed the pubes
[0:54:15] <%CateHecate> HEPHEPHEP-UKEN
[0:54:16] <+KevinsLunchbox> i like the fashion souls tbh
[0:54:19] <derap41> Shaved em off his helmet
[0:54:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now this may take a while
[0:54:25] <youngking_kush> TARAUMAKI
[0:54:36] <hawmaro95> would have hit reggie in DS2 LUL
[0:54:41] <%hukurowl> yo what is this drip
[0:54:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> little boar feets
[0:54:46] <derap41> Or a boar
[0:54:46] <%hukurowl> Reggie's fashion is nuts
[0:54:48] <%hukurowl> I love it
[0:54:51] <Omenaire_> LUL
[0:54:53] <%Necnill> LUL
[0:54:56] <SoaringTrumpet> LUL
[0:55:03] <Artiamus> Did he decide to stop using the rapier? I know it scales better then the catch pole.
[0:55:06] <%linSP> Huff it
[0:55:11] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:55:23] <+Shishi1205> chat the big crystal ember is only after killing seath right?
[0:55:27] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie is dressed gorgeously. Someone brought up that pig wizard is basically Ganon.
[0:55:36] <+KevinsLunchbox> has Reggie seen Seethe yet?
[0:55:37] <LunarRemix> Correct @Shishi1205
[0:55:41] <$eco419> IS YOUR GAME REGGY
[0:55:46] <+Shishi1205> yeah I thought so
[0:55:47] <+Undenizen> Yeah Reggie. Hoof it!
[0:55:57] <Equirah> @Artiamus it being a rapier means it takes more swings and i think he interpreted that as it being worse, he kept over comitting and getting hit
[0:56:01] <%Xaeveax> @KevinsLunchbox First time, yes.
[0:56:01] <+Shishi1205> Is Sieglindes quest online?
[0:56:03] <velgaduere> dun. dundun dun nuh "ow"
[0:56:12] <+KevinsLunchbox> sweet
[0:56:12] <deeriojim> yeah gotta love those archers
[0:56:23] <KellBeII> Eli lost his mind going through here the other week
[0:56:32] <slackerunchained> @Treasure_Vault Reggie has inadvertently linked his playthrough to the Zelda timeline. ...The flow of time is convoluted in Hyrule, apparently.
[0:56:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> so bring two
[0:56:43] <%hax_metatron> Yeah, I do like how they use basic enemies, but give them crystal weapons
[0:56:45] <Crowroost> sending positive vibes through dem crystalz
[0:56:52] <%hax_metatron> You know you sholdn't fuck with crystal weapons
[0:56:52] <Artiamus> @Artiamus Yeah I can understand that. Different playstyle weapon. Hoping he gets the next tail cut and goes Moonlight.
[0:56:56] <+Undenizen> this area does a good job fucking you up on mirror level design
[0:56:57] <oda_flobunaga> Doctors use obsidian scalpels for a reason
[0:57:09] <brunoberserk> ''fuck crystal magic , all my homies hate crystal magic '' - Havel , probably
[0:57:13] <+Shishi1205> Reggie if you are not going to use your shield why not use the grass emblem one to get extra staminna?
[0:57:30] <Daxalog> When you charge your JO crystal so much that the crut forms armor and wapons
[0:57:30] <+Shishi1205> weight the + and -
[0:57:45] <Daxalog> crust*
[0:57:46] <youngking_kush> These Channeler guys can fuck off lol
[0:57:46] <glass_marcus> I forget if this chest is worth it
[0:58:00] <Equirah> @glass_marcus avelyn, 3 shot crossbow
[0:58:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> Bedbug style
[0:58:02] <DSD24> Look at him yucking it up
[0:58:08] <%Ensign_Epic> @glass_marcus Not for this build, probably not. Overall, yes, Avelyn is bae
[0:58:15] <+Undenizen> @glass_marcus if you don't remember, the answer is probably no
[0:58:20] <+Mendin> <Blade> USE IT
[0:58:27] <slackerunchained> I kinda wish Havel hadn't gotten 'mysteriously' locked in that tower, just cause I would've really liked for him to be a summon for the fight with Seath.
[0:58:31] <%CateHecate> *klonk*
[0:58:35] <nxflre> theres thee savee quite method to safely drop down
[0:58:37] <+Shishi1205> damn these fuckers really resist magic dmg

[0:58:43] <OblivionSword1> damn you enclosed space
[0:58:49] <%amaranthos> Havel did nothing wrong
[0:58:57] <Crowroost> Kinda wondering why we're still in the Staircases of Confusion bit after Reg opened the way to Crystal Caves last stream...

[0:59:58] <deeriojim> ooh vagrant
[0:59:59] <oda_flobunaga> HARK
[0:59:59] <tolloponik> WOW
[0:59:59] <slackerunchained> Man. Reggie is gonna experience some serious Deja Vu when he hits the Grand Archives in game 3...
[1:00:01] <KyberNasse> Spine disintegrated
[1:00:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ANOTHER ONE?!
[1:00:01] <%tigerfang86> WHOA vagrant
[1:00:01] <+Mendin> THIRD ONE
[1:00:02] <pebblypirate> WOAH
[1:00:06] <%holydeviant1> Another one!
[1:00:06] <%RemedyofRevenge> how the fuck
[1:00:08] <brunoberserk> LUCKY
[1:00:10] <%Qsmash_> a what now???
[1:00:12] <Crowroost> hacks confirmed
[1:00:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> weird
[1:00:14] <slackerunchained> They come in several colors.
[1:00:14] <deeriojim> I think they spawn when you lose 5 humanities
[1:00:14] <%Ashenik1> WHAT
[1:00:15] <+LordCruxist> Damn son.
[1:00:15] <cs0402196> fk
[1:00:17] <drunken_lemur> What
[1:00:17] <%Ensign_Epic> Evil Vagrant, non-phantom version.
[1:00:18] <%kewlmyc> I've never seen that
[1:00:20] <youngking_kush> WTF
[1:00:20] <tolloponik> THIRD ?!
[1:00:21] <Slim_Lipid> bullshit
[1:00:23] <+NeonFishFace> what the hell
[1:00:24] <+LordCruxist> I never saw Vagrants!
[1:00:26] <%brandt_connors> unbelievable
[1:00:27] <%RemedyofRevenge> ive gone playthrough never seeing a single one
[1:00:28] <Slim_Lipid> bullshit PunOko
[1:00:28] <%linSP> lucky reg
[1:00:30] <KellBeII> i think thats one is actually bugged, its appeared for me in the same location two or three times before
[1:00:31] <Treasure_Vault> Might be more common these days
[1:00:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> i saw one ever
[1:00:32] <%Ashenik1> I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE
[1:00:34] <deeriojim> the more ppl play, the more common they become
[1:00:34] <+Shishi1205> They are quite rare still
[1:00:34] <%hukurowl> for real did the Remaster buff their spawn rate or something?
[1:00:35] <%amaranthos> I'm so mad about video games
[1:00:38] <%Qsmash_> I've never seen one what the fuck?
[1:00:38] <+CrabStealer> I've seen 1 across 4 playthroughs...
[1:00:39] <%linSP> billions of hours
[1:00:39] <Treasure_Vault> I mean, everyone dies here
[1:00:41] <slackerunchained> I still wonder why they're crablike, tho.
[1:00:41] <glass_marcus> I've played remaster like 5 times and never saw one
[1:00:42] <+Undenizen> i think i've seen one?
[1:00:42] <hawmaro95> I never saw any
[1:00:45] <Artiamus> I have played this game for years and never had one appear myself.
[1:00:45] <cs0402196> never seen a vagrant
[1:00:49] <+saltpiggu> I've literally never seen one
[1:00:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[1:00:51] <+NeonFishFace> not seen one ever
[1:00:51] <mrmosquitoman> I saw 2 in one day
[1:00:51] <+Neelpos> They're more likely in the Remaster 100%
[1:00:51] <%Ensign_Epic> Lower-level evil vagrant. Occurs when large blood stains are lost. This one has only been passed between under 30 worlds.
[1:00:52] <%hax_metatron> Vagrants were extremely rare in original, but tweaked to be more present in remastered
[1:00:52] <Treasure_Vault> Plenty of deaths to inspire vagrants here
[1:00:52] <tolloponik> I only saw one but I don't know how the remaster dose things
[1:00:52] <%Qsmash_> I didn't even now they existed until now.
[1:00:52] <%hukurowl> even when Prepare to Die was pretty active I never saw a single one
[1:00:52] <+SaltySnax> they seem way more common in the remaster
[1:00:53] <+SuperThorio> I saw a bunch when remaster first came out
[1:01:00] <%Vigonept> THEY ARE
[1:01:04] <%kewlmyc> original
[1:01:07] <+saltpiggu> yes I've played the remaster
[1:01:08] <tolloponik> OG
[1:01:14] <+Undenizen> i feel like THIS area is where i saw mine too.
[1:01:18] <Johannen> OG, only seen 1
[1:01:18] <pebblypirate> @WoolieVersus it could be people going to where you're streaming and purposefully dieing so they spawn on you
[1:01:19] <RiverBirch> Vagrants exist in OG Dark Souls
[1:01:19] <deeriojim> in the original its super rare, simply because not enough ppl play anymore
[1:01:22] <+SaltySnax> Either they're more common on the remaster or the online is jsut stronger and they happen more
[1:01:23] <glass_marcus> yall are just lucky
[1:01:24] <Crowroost> Man, remember Vagrant Story?
[1:01:25] <+SilverDevilfish> Remaster and original do online stuff differently could be why they're more common in remaster
[1:01:25] <%IronOhki> All together, I saw 2 in prepare to die, and 7 in remastered, ever.
[1:01:27] <Pie_Mastyr> I had never seen one until I played the remaster on ps4
[1:01:29] <%Ashenik1> I played original PC version and then on PS4
[1:01:42] <%linSP> May also depend on time of day you play
[1:01:42] <tachi_gigas> Played remaster a ton and I've only seen 1
[1:01:47] <%Ensign_Epic> They must have improved the remaster, I even got one on an invisible bridge in the Caverns, on top of the 9 or so others I saw in a recent playthrough
[1:01:49] <plsletmemakeaccount> the frequent vagrants are due to all the newbies hyped for elden ring, playing this game, and losing souls because new
[1:01:55] <+Shishi1205> they are a strange creature to say the least

[1:01:56] <Equirah> @hukurowl they improved networking so they actually travel worlds now, plus there's a lot of people playing now pre-ER. (and some people purposelly populated the game with vagrants)
[1:02:22] <Crowroost> @plsletmemakeaccount Oh I like that theorem
[1:02:39] <%Ensign_Epic> It's actually fairly trivial to force vagrants to spawn if you know what you're doing.
[1:02:40] <%AceNugget> the buff disrespect
[1:02:50] <+Shishi1205> vagrant need loss of big bloodstain + travelling worlds
[1:02:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> Light into a heavy might work
[1:02:54] <slackerunchained> Plus, I imagine some folks are still playing when these guys stream, just in the distant, vain hope of invading or being summoned by Reggie.

[1:03:12] <%brandt_connors> no because the archer is buffed
[1:03:15] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 Evil vagrants start off as a vagrant, not as a drift item. So this is only partially true
[1:03:19] <Crowroost> "Notice my Vagrant, Reggarth-kun"
[1:03:23] <$eco419> You can make them appear by dropping things right?
[1:03:39] <+Shishi1205> They are really confusing man...
[1:03:53] <%HeroToxiko> did he run into the hallway?
[1:03:55] <velgaduere> LMAO

[1:04:45] <%Orcapugs> CCCCounter….
[1:04:51] <deeriojim> this is a shield up area
[1:04:51] <youngking_kush> That's what the dance does
[1:04:53] <%swesterly> He has to take the ladder to get upstairs
[1:04:54] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> That Crystal hollow has got better skills than the legendary archers from Anor Londo.
[1:04:57] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus On the previous stream One Guy said you can walk to drop unto that chest if you have fast roll weight after pulling the device, not sure from which position
[1:04:57] <%RemedyofRevenge> spinners dont stop
[1:05:06] <Awesome_Leaf> why did that arrow kill lmao
[1:05:07] <Jaxnos> they commin for those cheeks
[1:05:14] <%HeroToxiko> that hitbox tho
[1:05:15] <deeriojim> taking it slow and dealing with the bowmen is a good idea too
[1:05:16] <%ronin19xx> Spinner? Kappa Kappa
[1:05:41] <Crowroost> Real talk, this Archives purgatory is the replacement for breezing past Anor Londo archers
[1:05:41] <Equirah> why does he keep comming here on this level
[1:05:42] <%BignanasTheGawd> would you like a side of crystal with your crystal?
[1:05:49] <%IronOhki> Can you take me higher? SingsNote
[1:06:02] <Equirah> ! Navigation at risk !
[1:06:03] <LunarRemix> It's archers one way or the other lol
[1:06:08] <+Shishi1205> Wow I did not know vagrants have set spawn points in each area
[1:06:42] <%swesterly> I think he needs to use the ladder to get back up
[1:06:49] <+Mendin> @Equirah Internal Maps are Reggie's weakness, and Woolie warned him when they got to this place
[1:06:50] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its not the roll but the weight of your equipment needs to be light for the speed of movement i guess
[1:06:55] <slackerunchained> Kill before you sip, Reg.
[1:06:57] <+Shishi1205> also yeah good vagrants are items first and they escape when they see you. If they escape enough times they get the black phantom colour
[1:07:00] <hawmaro95> Crystal archers > silver knights
[1:07:06] <Ser_mr_dr_prof_man> Woolies Phys defense might be lower in the robes. Which might be why the arrows bodied him.
[1:07:12] <nxflre> @Crowroost had to happeen
[1:07:20] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 Like I said, they're actually VERY well documented. Most people don't realize this, though, because most people don't know what they are, and when they learn what they are everyone is all "ZOMG TEH RARE"
[1:07:39] <Jaxnos> Thereeeeee goes myyyy heroooooo
[1:07:41] <%HeroToxiko> LUL clipping through the stairs for maximum accuracy
[1:07:53] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 As a creature implemented in the game they are weird

[1:07:59] <Equirah> @Mendin but at some point you have to realise the first option you keep taking is not the way
[1:08:03] <LunarRemix> If you miss it you're dead.
[1:08:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> Man fuck this drop
[1:08:21] <Equirah> you have to RUN down

[1:09:31] <thefranchise00> nice new armor
[1:09:31] <%Indigo_Automaton> Does he have the cat ring?
[1:09:37] <+cdrom321> @thepich You wish.
[1:09:39] <+Mendin> There is no cat ring in DS1
[1:09:43] <gryffinp> ...did
[1:09:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cat ring isnt a thing in 1
[1:09:47] <gryffinp> did you guys see that
[1:09:48] <deeriojim> I think the timing is to walk in lightest equip load speed then turn a bit to the left when falling off
[1:09:50] <+Mendin> There is, however, Fall Control
[1:10:00] <Jaxnos> you see, when jumping from a train you still carry the train's horizontal velo-
[1:10:05] <deeriojim> its been a long while since I did it though, so I might be remembering wrong

[1:11:24] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Bless wikidot they have the spawn requirements: Evil Vagrants are the result of unretrieved humanity being lost. If a bloodstain containing 5 or more soft-humanity isn't picked up by a player before they die, a Vagrant will be sent to another person online.
[1:11:26] <Jaxnos> that last archer headshot would have me too afraid to roll under magic shots, i appreciate reggie's moxie

[1:18:21] <lotharrio> Double Avelyn playthrough, let's go!
[1:18:32] <Blank9> Avelyn’s nutty damage
[1:18:36] <Slim_Lipid> bolts aren't arrows ree BabyRage
[1:18:38] <Lefteron> bows are better than crossbows
[1:18:40] <%holydeviant1> It's a mechanism that pulls the bow for you
[1:18:41] <+Shishi1205> more power less accuracy
[1:18:42] <Treasure_Vault> the crossbow just holds a bow
[1:18:47] <velgaduere> ah I'm just having fun man LUL
[1:18:47] <+saltpiggu> I mean, there are a lot of advantages to a bow that a crossbow doesn't have in real life
[1:18:49] <+SilverDevilfish> Crossbows are the in between of a bow and gun
[1:18:55] <+profanityincluded> yes and no, crossbows are just ezmodo bows and arrows
[1:18:57] <slackerunchained> @Lefteron That's situational.
[1:19:11] <velgaduere> BRRRRRRAP
[1:19:12] <@Menitta> that's fucking cool
[1:19:15] <SilverFaustX> wtf happend on stan lees twitter
[1:19:28] <deeriojim> you can manually aim the crossbows with binoculars
[1:19:29] <+Shishi1205> except the sniper one? or not even that one
[1:19:32] <%Ensign_Epic> Crossbows are objectively better than bows in the Souls series. This isn't even a debate, an off-hand ranged option that most people can toss onto their character is nuts. Also does pretty sweet damage.
[1:19:35] <+Shishi1205> @SilverFaustX did you check it?
[1:19:35] <%Ashenik1> @Lefteron  my inner historian got triggered and wants you to know it depends
[1:19:37] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ThomasOfTroy
[1:19:37] <%jinking79> Crossbow kid ver of the Bow
[1:19:39] <slackerunchained> EXCELLENT for inflicting status effects via special ammuntion.
[1:19:41] <Crowroost> twice; right so far
[1:19:41] <SilverFaustX> ye
[1:19:54] <%paladinstarbuster> gotta upgrade it too
[1:19:57] <+Shishi1205> crossbows in pvp are common
[1:19:59] <%holydeviant1> @slackerunchained You know, I never thought of that
[1:20:06] <wantedsafe471> Ds2 did crossbows justice. and remastest for ds1
[1:20:12] <slackerunchained> Smack them three times over with the debuff.
[1:20:13] <lotharrio> I learned awhile ago, that the Chinese word for crossbow is literally translated as "woman bow."
[1:20:20] <+Baldzinga> Powerstance Crossbow. The absolute dream.
[1:20:22] <Blank9> Lightning avelyn with wooden bolts is cheap, easy range
[1:20:31] <Lefteron> I should have been specific, i am mostly refering to 100years war, longbows
[1:20:31] <%Ashenik1> Crossbows are useless after the invention of guns
[1:20:32] <+Shishi1205> bro reloading a crossbow is not easy
[1:20:34] <%Ensign_Epic> Avelyn has the highest potential DPS of the crossbows on top of some pretty fair minimum stats. Just gotta land all 3 shots, though
[1:20:36] <@Menitta> I wish whips were good in DS
[1:20:40] <KellBeII> sadly in ds1 there are no poison bolts so you cant use it that waay
[1:20:42] <%Xaeveax> @lotharrio I wonder if that's due to how bows are fired.
[1:20:46] <+Shishi1205> the fuck they mean woman bow
[1:20:47] <Slim_Lipid> :)
[1:20:51] <+Baldzinga> Old Whip in DS2 was pretty good, minus the durability

[1:21:21] <Blank9> Power stance ailment whips in 2 is a true joke
[1:21:24] <velgaduere> the forest floor is basically diarrhea vomit
[1:21:26] <%Xaeveax> @FrostedZaibatsu Yup.
[1:21:29] <+profanityincluded> pretty sure some old british history was like "yo crossbows are awesome for children"
[1:21:30] <%Ensign_Epic> Whips in DS are also pretty alright; just gotta know what to use them for. Great as an off-hand zoning tool & parries on L2 in DS1
[1:21:31] <%robosqueeb> whoever mentioned stan lees Twitter i want you to know I'm sad now

[1:22:17] <gryffinp> @wantedsafe471 we took a look at the sky door last session
[1:22:19] <%Xaeveax> @wantedsafe471 They already looked at it from a distance
[1:22:23] <oak120> @wantedsafe471 Saw it at the end of last stream I think
[1:22:24] <SilverFaustX> omg they even made bob ross nft's..
[1:22:28] <octotasty> o: Is this the first zone he does after placing the Lordvessel?

[1:22:48] <slackerunchained> Naturalmente.
[1:22:48] <SoaringTrumpet> rude
[1:22:50] <oak120> I love those fatty messages, they ALWAYS there
[1:22:51] <DSD24> These enemies were always really funny looking to me
[1:22:51] <octotasty> I hope Reggie gets that Tail Cut
[1:22:52] <Jaxnos> chunky fatty
[1:22:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> always gets me
[1:23:03] <slackerunchained> Use your spelss to lure them over, yeah
[1:23:05] <Crowroost> three bois shooting craps in the back
[1:23:10] <Lefteron> Reggarth became a boar magician?
[1:23:31] <Chatterbox1991> ooh my FREAKEN GOURD
[1:23:35] <slackerunchained> @Lefteron Reggie is training to become Ganon.
[1:23:44] <oak120> this boar head - channeler combo is pretty good honestly
[1:23:45] <Jaxnos> they're using meter
[1:23:46] <deeriojim> @Lefteron he is doing the Ganondorf cosplay
[1:23:48] <%Ensign_Epic> This will be the area that forces Reggie to learn you can't fight goddamned everything while doing boss runs
[1:23:54] <DSD24> Powah Dunk!
[1:23:59] <+Shishi1205> I recommend switching weapons vs crystal bois for an easier experience
[1:24:00] <oda_flobunaga> Boarcerer
[1:24:00] <+Bitscreed> Soy Sauce for Reggarth
[1:24:03] <lord_of_the_dragons> just got done bagging my childhood bionicle comics I found in the garage, they were in great condition
[1:24:07] <gryffinp> unlike a lot of the previous boar head outfit, the channeler outfit is so big that it helps make the boar head look less disproportional
[1:24:16] <kikosmore> @Ensign_Epic He didn't fight everything on the 4 kings run
[1:24:18] <wantedsafe471> hopefully Reggie doesn't get !!Cursed!!

[1:26:26] <Crowroost> "baby why you gotta make me cry?"
[1:26:27] <+SilverDevilfish> Zieg uses a Zwei I think. She uses a bastard sword
[1:26:30] <KellBeII> "have you seen my father?" "yeah"

[1:26:53] <%AbnormalVoid> never thought of that, but yeah, it's a good clue
[1:26:53] <%Ensign_Epic> It is important to keep in mind how much of a badass Sieglinde is. SHE ISN'T UNDEAD. AND SHE GOT HERE ON HER OWN.
[1:26:53] <%RyTYoung> @sporeian94 Theyve got layers Kappa
[1:26:54] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus The only way to distinguish them on sight is that Seigmeyer uses the Zweihnder and his daughter uses the bastard sword.
[1:26:54] <%livlinn> woolieGIRLS
[1:26:58] <+profanityincluded> @paladinstarbuster she can be both Kreygasm
[1:26:59] <wantedsafe471> did he do the onion quest?
[1:27:07] <deeriojim> I dont know
[1:27:09] <%RyTYoung> @thebuttravage oh shit didn't realise that
[1:27:11] <@Solidus_113> Onion was last in blighttown
[1:27:33] <OldOnyx> Reggie putting the pieces together
[1:27:38] <%paladinstarbuster> @profanityincluded true
[1:27:41] <pepinillomaton> Claymore or BASS CANNON
[1:27:43] <%Ensign_Epic> I though Sieglinde uses Claymore?
[1:27:44] <+saltpiggu> claymore vs zweihander
[1:27:44] <%robosqueeb> well the voice too
[1:27:45] <Crowroost> Bearer Sieg Sieg lest
[1:27:47] <wantedsafe471> oh yeah, I forgot. She not undead, she's human. Total badass
[1:27:50] <legacy0117> Onion Knight Gal?
[1:27:50] <octotasty> She uses a Claymore, Siegward uses a Zweihander
[1:27:52] <deeriojim> @Solidus_113 ah so reggie did meet him down there?
[1:27:54] <legacy0117> Cute!
[1:28:02] <%holydeviant1> Seigmeyer uses a two hander, his daughter uses a longsword
[1:28:05] <%RyTYoung> ohhhhh
[1:28:08] <@Menitta> I love that glass sound effect
[1:28:09] <Jaxnos> we in the ring ready to rumble now
[1:28:10] <TheButtravage> @octotasty Bastard Sword, Claymore is a bit bigger.
[1:28:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's a dangerous sip
[1:28:11] <thefranchise00> he got you in the corner
[1:28:11] <deeriojim> he cornercamping
[1:28:16] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus she's still human in a land of hollows and undead
[1:28:22] <+SilverDevilfish> Claymore is also lighter in color
[1:28:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> Does reggarth have another weapon to use? That weapon does a significant percentage of damage as magic
[1:28:37] <mothdude> No healing properties in these crystals.
[1:28:42] <+vaderxyz1970> What are the other members of the Sieg family? Siegarina, Siegarth, Seigwinova?
[1:28:43] <Crowroost> Charging your JO armor
[1:28:54] <deeriojim> @mothdude plenty of hurting though
[1:28:55] <wantedsafe471> Wait, how did she get to anor Londo?
[1:28:57] <FrostedZaibatsu> Is this area killing the bitrate?
[1:29:13] <pepinillomaton> Notice how Seath is  still kidnapping ladies for his experiments

[1:29:22] <DSD24> I love this set!
[1:29:22] <%HeroToxiko> @mothdude Reiki asmr: you died edition
[1:29:25] <velgaduere> Hollow Knight same universe confirmed
[1:29:28] <slackerunchained> It's armor that got c**ked up, but gained special properties in the process of *getting* F**ked up...
[1:29:29] <TheRaubvogel> worn by a hollow knight pog
[1:29:29] <Equirah> @wantedsafe471 same way her father, solaire, lautrec and logan did
[1:29:30] <DSD24> Look how cool this looks
[1:29:38] <sporeian94> The power of the crystals and the essentials oils
[1:29:49] <Crowroost> Onion girls make the tastiest Shoggoths
[1:29:50] <DSD24> It looks so cool though
[1:29:53] <pepinillomaton> goop TM armor
[1:29:53] <OldOnyx> Claymore is still a greatsword in this series vs  zweihander as an "ultra greatsword"
[1:30:00] <deeriojim> for some reason you can't upgrade this armour
[1:30:00] <foghornleghorn55> best looking set
[1:30:01] <velgaduere> looks like shit
[1:30:04] <ocean_fran> thats what seth is cookin in the lab
[1:30:10] <DSD24> The Mask is my favorite part
[1:30:11] <Dr_Mooose> gonna poke an eye out
[1:30:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can crystal armor be repaired?
[1:30:17] <Crowroost> Is the opposite of "drip", "stab"?
[1:30:19] <wantedsafe471> Guess was lying yet again about you being the first to make to anor Londo
[1:30:20] <octotasty> covered in Seath's Stuff
[1:30:34] <pepinillomaton> Dragon juice
[1:30:34] <%RyTYoung> It's basically a Miracle from Blasphemous Kappa
[1:30:36] <DSD24> Well I don't think it goes inward
[1:30:38] <octotasty> sticky crystalline stuff
[1:30:42] <DSD24> I think its outward

[2:07:49] <@Menitta> I see
[2:07:50] <LunarRemix> It's good for him if he wants to take a normal weapon to magic or enchant
[2:07:54] <TheButtravage> @Lefteron They have a low chance to, yes.
[2:08:00] <%A_German_spy> @Menitta Mind you, the jank can be a double-edged sword.

[2:09:14] <oak120> A  full prism stone path looks really nice in here
[2:09:16] <@Solidus_113> and it'll disappear when you die
[2:09:18] <slackerunchained> <*Tink!*>
[2:09:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Well, it's not like he can lose the slab
[2:09:20] <DrkJP520> Wouldn't it be funny if the path changed on the way back?
[2:09:24] <%NahmenJayden> looks pretty nice ngl
[2:09:45] <+Mendin> simply having a wonderful christmastime
[2:10:03] <penitentpendant> A lot thinner though
[2:10:03] <deeriojim> yeah its invisible crysals
[2:10:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's just really pure
[2:10:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> I honestly never ever went to this spot
[2:10:25] <penitentpendant> Seethe used meter for the Fear Install
[2:10:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> "killed"
[2:10:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> I never went through that tunnel
[2:10:27] <velgaduere> he didn't kill shit lobosKek
[2:10:30] <wantedsafe471> yeah, it is. channels have removed the invisibility
[2:10:30] <%seydaq> thats the worst one
[2:10:31] <mothdude> "killed"
[2:10:39] <@Solidus_113> straight is also progress
[2:10:41] <%hukurowl> wait what no
[2:10:47] <@Menitta> not the comparison I wanna make but it's all I can think of, I thought it was like the lost woods in botw where the air particles lead you to the way. The snow particles crumble on the path
[2:10:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just make progress and finish the area for fuck's sake, there's nothing to see here lol
[2:10:48] <%hukurowl> this path ahead is progress
[2:10:50] <%hukurowl> woolie pls
[2:10:51] <ElBuraindo> they way is THERE
[2:10:53] <+Pleblu> Weird visually
[2:10:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just get it over with and talk about the area after
[2:11:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Swerve harder Reggie
[2:11:02] <DirtyMerlin> Is there a reason the paths are invisible?? Prob not right?
[2:11:09] <DirtyMerlin> Lore wise
[2:11:12] <oak120> as that guy deftly illustrated.
[2:11:13] <velgaduere> @DirtyMerlin because fuck you, Dark Souls
[2:11:15] <zhenthrim213> drunkard reggie
[2:11:15] <+Mendin> @DirtyMerlin Magic Crystal Bullshit
[2:11:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Because crystals, that's why
[2:11:15] <Slim_Lipid> need that N64 analog stick, DS5 too smooth
[2:11:17] <velgaduere> no other reason
[2:11:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> poor ghost
[2:11:19] <muxperience> ghosts falling to their death is hilarious
[2:11:20] <nxflre> stick is drifty maybe?
[2:11:21] <Jaxnos> that bloodstain was actually a great visual for what woolie was saying
[2:11:24] <deeriojim> @DirtyMerlin magic crystals Seathe messed around with, probably
[2:11:28] <dundore77> dont these not stay if he dies?
[2:11:38] <kvassimoto> Might be oolacile magic Seethe collected in his time as Duke
[2:11:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:11:45] <DirtyMerlin> SeemsGood
[2:11:47] <Crowroost> Consult your crystal ball
[2:11:48] <nxflre> @dundore77 belieeve they despawn on death
[2:11:51] <velgaduere> bro is awfully cautious for someone with only 1600 souls
[2:11:55] <kvassimoto> Since oolacile magic focuses on item manipulation
[2:11:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> ponder your stones
[2:11:58] <Lefteron> @dizimous only that he may have been studing Oolaciel
[2:11:59] <@Menitta> oooh the crystal drops do help
[2:12:00] <OldOnyx> they dont stay or didn't in the old game at least
[2:12:01] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[2:12:02] <Artiamus> Everyone dies to Seath the first time due to not knowing to break the crystal
[2:12:02] <%linSP> This really is a Stone Ocean
[2:12:03] <%seydaq> are ya ready  kids
[2:12:05] <lotharrio> @DirtyMerlin Invisibility is another aspect of sorcery. Think of it as refracting light.
[2:12:09] <penitentpendant> @Crowroost I guess that's one way for Seethe to hit on people
[2:12:11] <%holydeviant1> poor reggie sounds defeated
[2:12:15] <%kewlmyc> "I'm gonna run straight" *Immediately zig zags*
[2:12:19] <@Menitta> this is a really neat area
[2:12:21] <wantedsafe471> is r Reggie gonna buy prism stones every time he makes an attempt?
[2:12:28] <%AbnormalVoid> I NEVER FOUND THAT
[2:12:29] <%hukurowl> to be fair to reggie, DS1 is by FAR the meanest Souls game

[2:12:34] <%AbnormalVoid> no idea that was there
[2:12:35] <Jaxnos> there goes my herooooo

[2:13:13] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, DS1 is filled with intentionally dickish shit. Then DS2 has unintentional shitty hit/hurt boxes
[2:13:13] <%hukurowl> yeah he's seen these guys already
[2:13:14] <%FallenAngelZelos> So we think Reggie has how many more sessions till finishing? 1 or 2?

[2:13:34] <%NahmenJayden> I could go for some clams
[2:13:34] <%seydaq> will we see the 100%  combo?
[2:13:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> They are easy and give lots of things
[2:13:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> The ol' clam slam
[2:13:38] <LimitBreak_J> I hope he gets the tail. I missed that on my run.
[2:13:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> get that clam with your pole
[2:13:39] <AverageHanzo> Blue Oyster Cult
[2:13:39] <zhenthrim213> wow he staggers
[2:13:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> They drop twinkling like 80% of the time
[2:13:41] <Crowroost> Keep clam and carry on
[2:13:46] <oak120> that 1 hit stagger is fantastic
[2:13:47] <TheButtravage> @kewlmyc Some of the mob layouts in DS2 seem intentionally dickish, especially in SotFS.
[2:13:50] <OldOnyx> DS1 is is probably the "fair"est game in the series
[2:13:51] <IamGreven> i dont know, i was already bunt out with the game
[2:13:53] <oda_flobunaga> Come on and Clam and welcome to the slam
[2:14:00] <Awesome_Leaf> spent all his luck on vagrant spawns
[2:14:04] <%waltzqueen> You spent all your luck

[2:14:12] <TheButtravage> @OldOnyx Easily.
[2:14:15] <Crowroost> damn he noticed the estus
[2:14:15] <deeriojim> getting the tail is a pain
[2:14:23] <lycandruid> having hummanity helps with drop rates
[2:14:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> @kewlmyc I'm finishing SotFS now and wow did the game have me heated sometimes

[2:15:35] <%FallenAngelZelos> @DirtyMerlin Think Hunter's Copse might be the worst haha
[2:15:37] <%CateHecate> The Story of Reuben Clamzo and His Strange Daughter [In the Key of A]
[2:15:41] <penitentpendant> Used up all the luck elsewhere
[2:15:45] <lycandruid> that was lucky ted
[2:15:46] <%IronOhki> Farm them twinkles.
[2:15:46] <%Ensign_Epic> It's to compensate for the other drop luck
[2:15:47] <%Deekman> Reggie's luck is finally evening out
[2:15:47] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Gonna motivate for the tail cut?  It's not a fun one.

[2:16:27] <velgaduere> I wonder if Reggie will remember that dragons have cuttable tails
[2:16:33] <JoePReal> Bad Clam luck but good Clam-voyance
[2:16:35] <deeriojim> pretty sure the gold ring and humanity luck stacks
[2:16:35] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> Woolie, don't forget to cut the tail.
[2:16:37] <+Bitscreed> Here we go.
[2:16:42] <TheButtravage> @TheButtravage It's pretty bad unless you use a high damage weapon while he stuns himself.  If you don't get it first try he constantly moves or the tail clips into the wall.

[2:20:39] <oda_flobunaga> Also, you a Duke
[2:20:41] <%holydeviant1> to be a bitch
[2:20:41] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus the crystals on seath's body are a result of his experiment into immortality with the primordeal crystal

[2:21:08] <%NahmenJayden> this run back sucks shit
[2:21:09] <AnonymousNate_> He might have gotten Gwynevere as well it seems so that makes it all worth it
[2:21:15] <+Meathands> I'm sad I missed golden golem fight
[2:21:16] <SoaringTrumpet> a lot comes with an aristocratic title

[2:21:25] <gryffinp> Seathe got what he wanted out of the deal
[2:21:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> thankfully, Seath LOVES it
[2:21:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> He just wanted to research shit

[2:21:29] <Omenaire_> 22k on yes
[2:21:30] <available_line> Dragons are very scholarly by nature actually
[2:21:31] <+Mendin> @Meathands Buddy, we all missed it
[2:21:35] <%Lion_kun> Does the tail drop if the crystal is unbroken?
[2:21:38] <oda_flobunaga> C'est la vie
[2:21:39] <ElBuraindo> @Meathands it fell after him
[2:21:42] <Lefteron> He also invented sorrcery.
[2:21:43] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus he didn't start as a librarian he became one by researching immortality. He can't become immortal with no scales
[2:21:44] <conchthechimera> He has his 6 eye buddies for the bedtime stories

[2:21:48] <%HeroToxiko> legs, or power
[2:21:48] <+Double_Tap_That> Let's go Reggie!
[2:21:50] <+Meathands> of course it did
[2:21:51] <%kewlmyc> He got to tap(?) Gwyndolyn though, so there's that.
[2:21:52] <%CateHecate> also he's a duke, implying he's lord of some amount of land.....literally 500 feet from gwyn's city of anor londo, so it seems hes a duke in the sense that he owns the archives land and nothing else lol
[2:21:54] <%ThePich> leg it
[2:21:54] <TheButtravage> @Lion_kun Good question, I've only ever gone for it when he can take damage.

[2:22:43] <Crowroost> I literally gave up on MLGS because the bitch is CONSTANTLY spinnin
[2:22:44] <velgaduere> @nmulepingu he must learn
[2:22:45] <DedlokPM> Oki
[2:22:45] <Lefteron> JUST THE TIP A
[2:22:45] <%CateHecate> windshield wipers
[2:22:46] <wantedsafe471> on the ground
[2:22:46] <oak120> Tail whip was super effective.
[2:22:47] <%superc37> uuuh i think they forgot about the crystal
[2:22:47] <%hax_metatron> Chat: Doesn't he have to hit the crystal first, to even have a shot at doing damage to the tail?
[2:22:47] <%hukurowl> especially with his build
[2:22:51] <%kimbucha> @hax_metatron yes
[2:22:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> That glowing crystal usually grabs people's attention but this is just weird
[2:22:58] <%Irridium> can you even cut it off when he's still invulnerable?
[2:22:59] <%Ensign_Epic> @hax_metatron yeah lmao
[2:23:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:23:02] <pepinillomaton> Nice health chunks of damage Kappa
[2:23:02] <+kevlarkoala> @hax_metatron reggie CAN see chat!
[2:23:03] <%hukurowl> but he doesn't know that yet lo
[2:23:04] <Josef_Stryker> Just the tiiiip!
[2:23:04] <deeriojim> @hax_metatron he'll notice soon enough
[2:23:05] <%kimbucha> @Irridium nope
[2:23:05] <Artiamus> @hax_metatron I actually don't know if you can take the tail off before doing that
[2:23:06] <nxflre> @hax_metatron yup but Reg isnt noticing no dmg lol
[2:23:07] <%Lion_kun> Try getting the tail with a non heavy weapon
[2:23:07] <oda_flobunaga> @hax_metatron yep heh heh heh
[2:23:10] <OldManDeckardCain> seath is a may main Kappa
[2:23:11] <youngking_kush> I usually use 20 Estus and just brute force this shit
[2:23:14] <mothdude> It's funny how Seathe is a joke if you fight him normally and a nightmare if you go for the tail.
[2:23:15] <JdotSweapA> @hax_metatron nope. can cut tail anytime iirc
[2:23:18] <Lefteron> ooooh lord he coming
[2:23:19] <gryffinp> I did some google searching regarding the question on chat's mind, google thinks that you probably can do it but not with certainty
[2:23:19] <%FallenAngelZelos> GOOD DAMAGE Kappa
[2:23:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Thats just videogames tho
[2:23:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're never getting that tail until you destroy the crystal, god damnit
[2:23:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> What damage?
[2:23:23] <%Irridium> @kimbucha LUL
[2:23:25] <TheButtravage> @hax_metatron Not sure, I've never gone for the tail with the crystal up, so I dunno if the tail HP is linked to it or not.
[2:23:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[2:23:26] <dontleavemealone4toolong> DAMAGE!!!!!
[2:23:28] <%Xaeveax> The wall clipping is the main reason I find this tail hard to get.
[2:23:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> We do a little trolling
[2:23:31] <ShadowZiggy> oh no. he has no idea. oh no.
[2:23:31] <%Ensign_Epic> Tails actually have their own HP value so if you can't damage HP, you can't cut it
[2:23:34] <conchthechimera> REGGIE ITS RIGHT THERE
[2:23:34] <%holydeviant1> can you cut tail with the crystal on?
[2:23:37] <$eco419> The pole is the best to cut the tail
[2:23:38] <lyzejag> HE STARED IT FOR 4 SEC
[2:23:38] <conchthechimera> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAN
[2:23:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Usually you take out the crystal right away, because you walk right into it
[2:23:42] <Parasocial_Interaction> Did they destroy the phylactery?
[2:23:42] <%kewlmyc> Oh god, Reggie pls
[2:23:42] <+Mendin> Grant us eyes
[2:23:44] <lyzejag> I LOVE REGGIE SO MUCH
[2:23:44] <dontleavemealone4toolong> @WoolieVersus wheres your damage?
[2:23:44] <zhenthrim213> im right here
[2:23:44] <%MoistFeels> MoistFeels subscribed with Prime. 
[2:23:46] <+Huderga> it's actually glowing holy shit
[2:23:46] <LimitBreak_J> he will figure it out lol
[2:23:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> After the first fight you have to run to the back to get the crystal
[2:23:50] <sendart> reggie to focused on the tail
[2:23:50] <%HeroToxiko> he whip his tail back and fourth
[2:23:53] <pixel_river> Reggie will figure it out
[2:23:55] <Bust_ER> Grant usss eyess
[2:23:57] <%RemedyofRevenge> woolieYE woolieSPICE woolieYE get that fight moneyyyy
[2:23:57] <TheButtravage> @Ensign_Epic Is Seath's Tail HP linked to the crystal though?
[2:24:00] <%kewlmyc> CURSE
[2:24:04] <JdotSweapA> the tail only gives him regen. it doesnt make him invulnerable
[2:24:04] <LoreKeeper_Thal> livin'
[2:24:06] <kjb343> boing
[2:24:06] <DirtyMerlin> Slashing damage for tail cuts right?

[2:24:31] <bosssbatttle> how does reggie not notice hes not doing damage lul
[2:24:32] <$eco419> LUL
[2:24:32] <%amaranthos> Can he even get the tail without the thing being done
[2:24:32] <%Ensign_Epic> @Ensign_Epic Seath's entire HP bar is linked to the crystal. The tail counts as part of Seath's HP bar
[2:24:35] <dontleavemealone4toolong> @WoolieVersus Its like you're not hurting him
[2:24:35] <nxflre> @KeiganOfAstora thaats howw Dark Souls go man leet it be
[2:24:36] <dizimous> ! Bullshit !
[2:24:36] <%holydeviant1> @KeiganOfAstora  I don't think woolie knows.

[2:24:40] <%seydaq> poise boise
[2:24:45] <velgaduere> I wonder if Reggie will notice the HP bar
[2:24:47] <peachy996> yeah seathe shake that booty
[2:24:47] <pebblypirate> @Ensign_Epic you can technically out dps the regen but he will never cut it without doing the gimmik essentially
[2:24:51] <DedlokPM> I know game devs who value collision and they are cowards!
[2:24:52] <+Bitscreed> :O
[2:24:52] <jett_eyes> doe the crystal regenerate the tail's health too?
[2:24:53] <oak120> THE DODGE
[2:24:53] <pixel_river> nice
[2:24:53] <kikosmore> @KeiganOfAstora Reggie is so focused on the tail I don't even think he noticed the crystal.
[2:24:53] <+balkonas1> Mods please make chat emote only
[2:24:54] <%Irridium> @holydeviant1 oh I'm sure he knows he just wants reggie to suffer a bit

[2:25:02] <%vVAstrAVv> careful you dont do too much damage regg
[2:25:05] <Equirah> Somehow Kappa
[2:25:06] <Lefteron> kncucles.exe "oh no!"
[2:25:08] <Riyokuno> LUL
[2:25:08] <lotharrio> Somehow, Reggarth survived.
[2:25:09] <DirtyMerlin> Yeah the cutscene is pretty important if you think about it
[2:25:09] <deeriojim> I think woolie forgot about the crystal too
[2:25:15] <%superc37> yeah same
[2:25:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie, look at the boss bar just once
[2:25:17] <%zanz_san> Jesus
[2:25:19] <Slim_Lipid> OTG PogBones
[2:25:19] <%HeroToxiko> a jump button would have simplified this game so hard woolieEVIL
[2:25:19] <slackerunchained> To be fair, it is a VERY thick tail...
[2:25:20] <%mr_sups> Primordial Crystal
[2:25:21] <pixel_river> Kreygasm
[2:25:21] <%Xaeveax> Nah, Woolie didn't forget. He's giving him the true experience.
[2:25:22] <bosssbatttle> woolies gaslighting him LUL
[2:25:22] <catasteroid0> Reggie please look at his health bar
[2:25:23] <%leith_aziz> Hi again guys
[2:25:23] <Anderobot> Is woolie just fucking with him at this point?
[2:25:23] <%kewlmyc> Can you even get the tail before doing "you know what"?
[2:25:23] <the_extra_> Woolie doesn't seem to know either
[2:25:24] <pepinillomaton> Nice damage Reggie! Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:25:24] <velgaduere> DEEDLE DEE DOO
[2:25:25] <kikosmore> does most people even try to go for the tail on their first playthrough?
[2:25:25] <%IronOhki> God that catch pole is doing nothing in damage.
[2:25:27] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus He is swinging too low on the tail by the way.
[2:25:27] <LunarRemix> He can get the Moonlight Sword even with the crystal intact since the only thing that matters is poise damage
[2:25:28] <SoaringTrumpet> this is Seath's Christmas theme
[2:25:28] <+Mendin> The blind vs the blind, I love it
[2:25:29] <%hukurowl> man, Seathe's music S U C K S

[2:25:33] <%leith_aziz> pickyDerp
[2:25:33] <+j2tronic> This is hilarious
[2:25:34] <available_line> Can the fail be even cut with the invul active?
[2:25:34] <%SarcFa> doesn't he have to make Seath able to take real damage to tail cut?
[2:25:36] <slackerunchained> Clowns farting in Seath's basement...
[2:25:37] <velgaduere> some original Demon's Souls shit
[2:25:37] <cheapdoc> I don't think he forgot, but I don't think he'll remind Reggie
[2:25:38] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:25:39] <deeriojim> its a xylophone because CRYSTALS

[2:25:43] <%hukurowl> it's a real shame FromSoft didn't figure out goo dmusic until Bloodborne
[2:25:43] <oda_flobunaga> Don't blame Woolie, he's having fun.  Reggie has yet to notice he's doing absolutely no damage
[2:25:44] <wantedsafe471> 2 sets of eyes Reggie
[2:25:45] <%Irridium> yeah know woolie just wants to see how long it'll take him to realize I bet LUL
[2:25:47] <%Tearonex> cha real quick can he cut off the tail even to he hasn't done the thing?
[2:25:48] <%BisoromiBear> despite all his rage he's still just a clown in a cave
[2:25:49] <GHouseduivel> Glockenspiel time

[2:25:51] <+balkonas1> People shut up reggie can see thr chat
[2:25:52] <kikosmore> of course Woolie didn't forget.
[2:25:53] <daswampken> this theme >>>
[2:25:55] <%AbnormalVoid> Seath is a pretty princess
[2:25:55] <ElBuraindo> he needs to be reminded of Logan's words for gods sake
[2:25:57] <$eco419> LUL  can reggy get the tail if the crystal is there ?
[2:25:58] <%HeroToxiko> NICE
[2:25:59] <%seydaq> bull fighting skill needs work, think jokebane
[2:26:00] <%theoldone001> It makes sense his theme sounds crazy, because at this point so has Seath.

[2:29:33] <pebblypirate> you need to hit the very tip of the tail
[2:29:45] <radiorosewater> alright
[2:29:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Ros_Bef
[2:29:53] <Artiamus> Havel was right
[2:29:56] <kikosmore> @amaranthos I feel like that's straight fact.
[2:29:57] <%tigerfang86> Havel did SOME THINGS wrong but not hating on seath's ass
[2:30:00] <%amaranthos> Havel did nothing wrong
[2:30:02] <Aussie_Manny> Is this boss a metaphor for addicts defeating their vices?
[2:30:02] <nxflre> @amaranthos the prediction is seathe not run to seathe
[2:30:02] <TheButtravage> @Lion_kun He just has to get to the correct portion of the tail, lot of his previous swings were to low.
[2:30:03] <velgaduere> Havel was always the main character
[2:30:03] <kulmoth> HAVEL DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:30:05] <%Prevot> havel was seething

[2:30:22] <%amaranthos> Seathe did everything wrong

[2:30:48] <deeriojim> @kikosmore Cavemage STRINT build yea haha
[2:30:54] <%Ensign_Epic> @WoolieVersus R:; tail cut, that person is wrong as far as I know & I don't think they know what poise damage is. You apparently can cut the tail without a crystal break but it requires strats.

[2:31:39] <%Ensign_Epic> @gryffinp It never has
[2:31:41] <Equirah> crystal should be broken....
[2:31:44] <%seydaq> he fixed the cristal
[2:31:49] <%Ensign_Epic> Crystal always respawns, folks.

[2:31:51] <Robot_Ridley> LUL
[2:31:52] <DSD24> His wings clip too
[2:31:54] <Bromosap1ens> resistance is a placebo
[2:32:05] <Aussie_Manny> Crystal resistance
[2:32:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "Turn the light off~ And let her in~"
[2:32:05] <oak120> put the little crystal bits back together with glue, just for reggie to smash it again
[2:32:06] <%seydaq> resistance is never a good idea
[2:32:09] <wantedsafe471> resistance is trash
[2:32:11] <slackerunchained> "No! My precious immortality-crystal! Gone forevah! Gyaaaaaaah~!"

[2:32:18] <+kevlarkoala> if Reggie does all this to NOT use the weapon, I'm going to be so sad LUL

[2:32:26] <Equirah> he's talking about curse resitance chat
[2:32:31] <%jamsbybetty> pretty sure he meant curse resistant equipment not the stat you nobs
[2:32:32] <+xerotwo> LUL
[2:32:37] <%holydeviant1> The funny part is that Seathe can break the crystal himself

[2:32:41] <radiorosewater> *doot*
[2:32:41] <%Ensign_Epic> Leveling Res is legitimately never worth it. You're better served leveling a stat that just also gives you res
[2:32:47] <deeriojim> hm I think those hits werent on the tail
[2:32:51] <%fat_burtreynolds> Crimson cloak and Havel set has best curse resist
[2:32:55] <%NahmenJayden> somebody should mod in the RE Director's Cut Mansion Basement music

[2:33:04] <Bromosap1ens> Res is about as useful as lockdowns
[2:33:06] <Chatterbox1991> but with a rainbow xilaphone
[2:33:07] <pebblypirate> need to hit way closer to the tip
[2:33:12] <+Mendin> Hitting up high on the fat, gotta get that tip
[2:33:16] <%seydaq> tip
[2:33:17] <TheButtravage> @Ensign_Epic Yeah, it's the least useful stat in the series.
[2:33:19] <deeriojim> gotta hit further out on the tail
[2:33:22] <+Jiggisnipe> he knows you're there tho
[2:33:27] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> CMON SEATH
[2:33:29] <%HeroToxiko> that means he's scared
[2:33:31] <plaguedoctor_vi> You say that Woolie but SMT IV boss music has a xylophone
[2:33:31] <%fat_burtreynolds> He fatty
[2:33:32] <+Mendin> That's why he hides the tip in the wall, he aint no fool
[2:33:32] <%ronin19xx> This might be it
[2:33:32] <kulmoth> this fight is so jank, pure dark souls
[2:33:34] <Jaxnos> what a ... BIT-
[2:33:35] <%holydeviant1> Seathe knows what he's packing
[2:33:35] <DSD24> Just the tip
[2:33:36] <Aussie_Manny> "Are you back there? I know you are!'
[2:33:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> This tail cut is the absolute worst
[2:33:37] <oak120> "hes blind, he aint deaf dumbass"
[2:33:41] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Weak eyes, good ears
[2:33:42] <Lefteron> gime that buuuutt!
[2:33:47] <peachy996> Seathe is on his a game today
[2:33:48] <legacy0117> Imagine that for One Winged Angel. Lmao.
[2:33:48] <0rnan> I don't remember his tail bending and janking out as much in the original.
[2:33:49] <SoaringTrumpet> go for that tip
[2:33:50] <%Theycallmenerf> Get that tail Reggie
[2:33:50] <%Prevot> this tail is absolutely NOT the worst
[2:33:51] <%AbnormalVoid> I wish he knew his chaos fireball would be perfect for the tail
[2:33:54] <sporeian94> It'd be cool if you could cheese him with stealth since he's blind like Old Hero from Demon's Souls
[2:33:54] <wantedsafe471> no, kalameet is the worst tail fut
[2:33:55] <oda_flobunaga> Calameet's is also awful
[2:33:55] <%fat_burtreynolds> Remaster change anything about this fight chat?
[2:34:00] <OldOnyx> ...and then he backs his ass in to the wall
[2:34:02] <penitentpendant> Seath: "Stop aiming for the backside!" Players: "NEVERRRRRRR!"
[2:34:03] <%theoldone001> Seath and Kalameet tail cuts are the worst.
[2:34:04] <%Theycallmenerf> DeS fated Reggie to get that tail.
[2:34:09] <TheButtravage> @0rnan It's always been this shitty.
[2:34:10] <%HeroToxiko> is he reacting to the sound of your footprints?
[2:34:10] <peachy996> Let's Go Seathe! Let's Go Seathe!
[2:34:12] <DSD24> Imagine Seath going "Who's fighting me!"
[2:34:12] <%seydaq> kaly dont play with his tail
[2:34:14] <dalmek> a seeing eye clam
[2:34:16] <Jaxnos> cute, woolie
[2:34:18] <GHouseduivel> ugh -2
[2:34:19] <Nevarato> basically the part of the tail that has no hair
[2:34:22] <+Mendin> He had TWO seeing eye pigs
[2:34:24] <dalmek> those basilisks have huge eyes
[2:34:26] <DedlokPM> The Channelers are his Seeing Eye Sifs
[2:34:27] <dalmek> they could be helfpul
[2:34:30] <radiorosewater> ugh +2
[2:34:30] <%seydaq> he has seeing eye pineaples
[2:34:32] <slackerunchained> I thought the channelers were his seeing-eye assistance animals?
[2:34:34] <%Ensign_Epic> @theoldone001 I feel that Kalameet *just* edges Seath out in tail cut difficulty
[2:34:34] <Aussie_Manny> khadBlind "I dunno where you are, but when I find ya, I'mma get ya!"
[2:34:43] <%Theycallmenerf> Seathe has 4 wings right?
[2:34:49] <oda_flobunaga> Seeing eye Whussy
[2:34:49] <Bromosap1ens> @dalmek Those aren't the eyes believe it or not
[2:34:50] <%IronOhki> @slackerunchained I haven't heard that but it tracks to me.
[2:34:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is not gonna happen
[2:34:51] <Aussie_Manny> 'til you die
[2:34:57] <brunoberserk> i always make seath destroy his own crystal , and run to the tail , it works .. sometimes
[2:34:57] <kikosmore> This is why i never went for this.
[2:34:59] <Aussie_Manny> 'til the light dies in your eye
[2:35:00] <+BigBruthaThunda> Seath has an e-girl color palette
[2:35:01] <Aussie_Manny> LIVE TO WIN
[2:35:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's very worth it, but SO annoying
[2:35:02] <oak120> its frustrating, but super worth it
[2:35:04] <%mr_sups> It's like watching the movie 'Don't Breath'
[2:35:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea this is not worth it
[2:35:08] <%Fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:35:08] <+Jiggisnipe> the tip tho
[2:35:09] <nxflre> that slow swwing hurst
[2:35:10] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH!! LUL
[2:35:11] <SoaringTrumpet> Jebaited
[2:35:11] <+Mendin> Yes it is
[2:35:13] <DedlokPM> @Theycallmenerf 6 it looks like
[2:35:15] <TheButtravage> @theoldone001 Kalameet you have to bait out a very specific attack by standing in a specific location which if you don't understand is awful.  At least Kalameet doesn't clip out of bounds.
[2:35:17] <%hukurowl> it might not look worth it
[2:35:20] <dalmek> @Bromosap1ens oh I know but do you think Seathe knows? he'd probably just make them real through his wack experiments
[2:35:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> Literal cat and mouse shit
[2:35:21] <420moneymoney69> What does his tail give you?! Is it good?
[2:35:22] <%hukurowl> but it's fucking WORTH IT
[2:35:25] <+eanscrale> For his build, this tail will be a consideration
[2:35:25] <Lefteron> hahaha
[2:35:27] <%Theycallmenerf> @dedlokpm Oh I thought he had 4
[2:35:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Moonlight Greatsword. Useless for Reggie
[2:35:30] <lotharrio> Feels like this is one you take on with allies.
[2:35:33] <velgaduere> it'll be good for Reggie specifically!
[2:35:33] <Bromosap1ens> @dalmek Fair point.
[2:35:36] <%townzzzzz> a sword makes for a better cutting tool
[2:35:39] <%holydeviant1> @420moneymoney69 The single best Magic strength weapon in the game.
[2:35:41] <slackerunchained> Patience and persistence
[2:35:45] <oak120> Reggie has Str, Dex and Int. Its super worth it
[2:35:46] <%Ensign_Epic> @KeiganOfAstora are you nuts? dude's running a STR/INT build, you realize, yeah?
[2:35:46] <%hukurowl> Moonlight Greatsword is worthless for an Int/Str build???
[2:35:47] <%Qsmash_> Seath himself isn't hard but cutting the tail is the worst
[2:35:47] <DarknessHS> LUL
[2:35:47] <%IronOhki> Once you get the tail, he's a cake walk.
[2:35:48] <%AbnormalVoid> AGGGHHHH

[2:35:49] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH!! LUL

[2:36:02] <%BisoromiBear> it's the most worth it it's ever been
[2:36:04] <catasteroid0> Reggie keeps doing standing attacks instead of running attacks
[2:36:04] <%Theycallmenerf> YEEEEEEEEE
[2:36:05] <Aussie_Manny> C-C-C-C-COMBOOO
[2:36:05] <%Prevot> thanks seath tail for the EZ points
[2:36:07] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> YES FeelsGoodMan gimme that paper
[2:36:07] <%Xaeveax> It's the most annoying thing in this game. BoC is nothing compared to this tail.
[2:36:10] <youngking_kush> Kindle?
[2:36:10] <%zanz_san> Fuck this late game jank
[2:36:14] <deeriojim> gotta learn how to bait out his beam attack
[2:36:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Can you summon anyone in?
[2:36:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Someone just invade and drop the MLGS for him lol
[2:36:17] <%vVAstrAVv> otg baby
[2:36:18] <velgaduere> this weapon is the peak of Reggie's build
[2:36:21] <Robot_Ridley> hesitation is defeat
[2:36:22] <peachy996> Good job Seathe!
[2:36:22] <deeriojim> then dodge it like Gohan never could
[2:36:23] <sendart> moonlight. ain't got anybstr scaling lol
[2:36:24] <%amaranthos> Damn, I don't know if he will get it next time with the tail still on the table
[2:36:25] <%holydeviant1> Meanwhile, free channel points
[2:36:26] <%IronOhki> @Xaeveax I mean, Bed of Chaos.
[2:36:26] <youngking_kush> Bait out his beam attack
[2:36:30] <+Mendin> There's one extra trick to stun Seath longer at the start
[2:36:32] <+SilverDevilfish> The boss is honestly a joke if you're not trying to cut the tail
[2:36:38] <legacy0117> Good luck Reggarth….Whelp he missed.
[2:36:39] <JdotSweapA> does slash dmg work better?
[2:36:41] <OldOnyx> sad thing is the "tail" is outclassed by most heavy magic weapons in this games. It's not that great aside from using it's gimmick for the hydra and so on
[2:36:47] <JdotSweapA> also hows his pyromancy?
[2:36:50] <kikosmore> Damn, this whole day really about to be dukes. Kappa
[2:36:50] <%Xaeveax> @Xaeveax Yeah that's what I said. BoC = Bed of Chaos. Way easier than this tail.
[2:37:00] <%IronOhki> Oh, gotcha.
[2:37:03] <Aussie_Manny> bloody wanker
[2:37:05] <OldOnyx> unless they buffed it in the remaster and I doubt that
[2:37:05] <radiorosewater> @kikosmore You say that but...
[2:37:06] <oak120> @OldOnyx Counter Point: Its cool.
[2:37:06] <%linSP> Giant magic club still best
[2:37:09] <bosssbatttle> @OldOnyx i thought the tail was the best magic weapon in the game?
[2:37:10] <%Theycallmenerf> Weave
[2:37:13] <%NahmenJayden> reggie out here breaking ankles on his run back
[2:37:15] <brunoberserk> can you still make seath destroy his crystal with that beam at start of the fight in the remaster ?
[2:37:16] <%ThePich> reggie is so mad he became british
[2:37:19] <nxflre> @Mendin oh?
[2:37:21] <%jinking79> Now Reggie gonna win
[2:37:21] <deeriojim> They are resistant to magic, and your weapon do have a magic component to it, IIRC
[2:37:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> for such a character that's so important to Dark Souls lore Seath's battle kind of sucks.
[2:37:23] <Aussie_Manny> TIL "wanker" gets by the Twitch filter. FeelsGoodMan
[2:37:23] <%scrubsintodreams> Ughhhhh.... This run has been burned into mind since it gave me so much trouble the first time. LUL
[2:37:25] <JdotSweapA> get that great combustion out
[2:37:27] <420moneymoney69> @oldonyx What is the gimmick?
[2:37:27] <%Xaeveax> @IronOhki SeemsGood
[2:37:28] <%Theycallmenerf> @brunoberserk You can do that?
[2:37:35] <%Ensign_Epic> @Xaeveax Dude, Seath isn't even the hardest tail cut in this game, Kalameet exists. And BoC is WAY worse than Seath if you know what you're doing
[2:37:35] <Jaxnos> stay hydrated, kids
[2:37:36] <TheButtravage> @OldOnyx Arguable, but it's a very commonly used intelligence weapon.
[2:37:38] <Ros_Bef> He would have been beaten already if the tail was ignored :(
[2:37:42] <%hukurowl> same as in every From game, ranged beam attack
[2:37:48] <radiorosewater> ALL IN LETS GO
[2:37:48] <%seydaq> jbxSip
[2:37:49] <%hukurowl> MGS is great
[2:37:50] <%theoldone001> Bait Seath close to the crystal, break it, he is stunned for a moment once the crystal is broken.
[2:37:51] <%Xaeveax> @Xaeveax True, I forgot about Kalameet. That's really hard.
[2:37:56] <brunoberserk> @Theycallmenerf  yes is the easy way to got the tail
[2:38:09] <%fat_burtreynolds> Those crystal dudes are the sole reason as to why I always bump str to 50 so I can one hand the dragon tooth
[2:38:17] <oak120> those Butterflys fuck.
[2:38:19] <%Theycallmenerf> @brunoberserk I always took out the crystal and fought to get the tail :0
[2:38:21] <Aussie_Manny> Invisible Indiana Jones bridges are freaking bullshit. I hope they're not in Elden Ring.
[2:38:30] <%fat_burtreynolds> Crystal dudes are weak to bonk. Just like the b o n e  z o n e
[2:38:31] <scrumbotime> I CONSTANTLY forget that reggie is wearing that stuff, he looks like a Colossus
[2:38:31] <Laironx3> Stand near the crystal and Seath will destroy the crystal for you with his laserr
[2:38:34] <%Ensign_Epic> I cannot emphasize how happy I was that Reggie didn't start hitting the butterflies
[2:38:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Aussie_Manny OH you know there will be illusory bullshit
[2:38:41] <penitentpendant> @Aussie_Manny Invisible Jumping Puzzles
[2:38:44] <%jinking79> yeah Reggie learn and will beat this Bitch of a dragon
[2:38:46] <peachy996> i hope all the bullshit is in elden ring
[2:38:46] <%seydaq> @Xaeveax all that for a knife spyWhy
[2:38:50] <Aussie_Manny> nooooooo BibleThump
[2:39:05] <420moneymoney69> Man I hope he gets that weapon

[2:39:30] <%patriotrenegade> I hate Seath's music
[2:39:33] <%Prevot> yeah reggie just stare at him while he's staggered LUL
[2:39:33] <radiorosewater> @Sonny_Firestorm Nope
[2:39:37] <%Xaeveax> @patriotrenegade Same.
[2:39:39] <OldOnyx> Yeah,  it's pure magic damage that doesn't match the "bonus" damage of the same type you get from some of the enchanted weapons.
[2:39:39] <oak120> During the run back Seath is gluing the crystal back together each time.
[2:39:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:39:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> Man, how easy would this be with a halo sprint
[2:39:42] <+NeonFishFace> talk mad shit tho
[2:39:43] <%Ensign_Epic> So what brand of glue or epoxy do we think Seath uses on that thing? He an Elmer's eater or a Gorilla Glue kinda guy?
[2:39:44] <+TopTieramisu> despite the name, did you know the bifrost has nothing to do with ice?
[2:39:44] <Aussie_Manny> Seath smugly swings open his closet door, revealing shelves filled with spare crystal lights. lytSMUG
[2:39:44] <Jaxnos> imagine not putting your important invincibility crystal in a titanium vault
[2:39:45] <+Jiggisnipe> yea he's a bitch
[2:39:46] <JdotSweapA> its arguably safer to leave the cryatal alone cuz you run the risk of killing seath before the tail drops
[2:39:46] <velgaduere> is Reggie in fast roll weight range? he'll run faster if he is
[2:39:50] <zanzibarian_hamster> He gets mad and yells for a solid couple of seconds when you break the crystal, maybe lure him to it first @WoolieVersus
[2:39:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> The tail IS the boss fight
[2:39:52] <%BisoromiBear> he's free after the tail cut

[2:40:30] <Josef_Stryker> Are we allowed to give tips for the tail or no?
[2:40:32] <+rubeSandwich> Wow
[2:40:33] <%theoldone001> Bait him close to the crystal
[2:40:35] <OldOnyx> But it uses scales instead if blue titianite and judgements are cool, so there's that
[2:40:38] <peachy996> ring around the dragon

[2:40:39] <NumbF4ke> Dodged and rolled LUL

[2:40:43] <%hukurowl> maybe show Reggie what cutting the tail gives you, let him decide if it's worth it
[2:40:44] <OldOnyx> *instead of
[2:40:46] <peachy996> a pocketful of L's
[2:40:47] <foghornleghorn55> doesn't light armor make your run faster?
[2:40:48] <kikosmore> @legacy0117 nah, he's cut most of his tails with this weapon
[2:40:50] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Can also bait Seath to destroy his own crystal, generally gives the most time to go for the tail.
[2:40:59] <420moneymoney69> I hope he doesn’t give up on getting the tail. I think it will be interesting to see him change weapons
[2:41:01] <%townzzzzz> THE WAR FOR THE TAIL NEVER ENDS
[2:41:02] <legacy0117> Kewl. ^^
[2:41:03] <%Ensign_Epic> I think Seath uses E600 craft adhesive to repair his crystal, myself.
[2:41:04] <%swesterly> Use the back flip ring for more mobility
[2:41:05] <%Theycallmenerf> Reggie hitting the wall LUL
[2:41:05] <slackerunchained> It *IS* possible to use ranged attacks on the tail... Avelen might actually help, since I think # of hits is a thing...

[2:41:33] <TheButtravage> @slackerunchained There's no way Reggie is going to manually aim Avelyn to hit the tail.
[2:41:36] <AsinPersuasion> has reggie one and doned any bosses?
[2:41:36] <%Xaeveax> @Ensign_Epic Makes sense. Sometimes he whips out the googly stick-on eyes for it too.

[2:42:04] <Aussie_Manny> Ooohhhh, Seath can bumblefuck and break his own light crystal? Hehehe...

[2:44:34] <%patriotrenegade> u gotta hit it reggie
[2:44:35] <Aussie_Manny> So is going for the back tail the for-sure only good strat?
[2:44:36] <pepinillomaton> The running attack is good for this
[2:44:37] <peachy996> this is silly godzillas music from the 70s
[2:44:39] <TheButtravage> Ok, those were good hits.
[2:44:40] <derap41> 3 in a row is all you need
[2:44:41] <oak120> two good hits!
[2:44:41] <Laironx3> just the tip
[2:44:42] <Equirah> this is the one
[2:44:44] <+NotVeryLegendary> running attacks are key
[2:44:46] <Jaxnos> boy this tail is dumb
[2:44:46] <%Deekman> Can you cut with a pole?
[2:44:46] <AsinPersuasion> go reggie go
[2:44:46] <+Mendin> @Aussie_Manny Back tail for an item
[2:44:50] <GHouseduivel> Shoot your shot playa
[2:44:52] <%MooseIsGoose> just the tip
[2:44:53] <Equirah> i know i voted against it but this is the run
[2:44:55] <%Ensign_Epic> @deeriojim It depends on the type; bloodstain vagrants don't have the initial drift item stage so they grow into black phantom vagrants much more quickly
[2:44:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> further back
[2:45:02] <JdotSweapA> nattyt6Comf_HF
[2:45:03] <%MooseIsGoose> further back

[2:45:04] <Aussie_Manny> ooohhhh, there's a special purpose to getting the back tail? cool
[2:45:09] <gryffinp> if we're gonna get serious about it then it might be time to lighten the load and get some stamina boosters going
[2:45:11] <%seydaq> et used to these tail swipes spyCappa spyCappa
[2:45:14] <Josef_Stryker> Why does Reggie hardly use his running attack?
[2:45:20] <Josef_Stryker> Are running attacks weaker?
[2:45:21] <brunoberserk> maybe he need a bladed weapon ? i forgot , i not sure
[2:45:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis

[2:45:42] <%Ensign_Epic> How shit been, Spy?
[2:45:42] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis my money
[2:45:42] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus reggie should put on the crest shield since he's 2h
[2:45:47] <%A_German_spy> @Ensign_Epic He's been here.
[2:45:53] <VHGS> Good vagrants spawn when a drift item bag is left on the ground for 20 games. Evil vagrants spawn when someone loses a bloodstain with 5 or more soft humanity. Evil Vagrants turn red when they survive for 20 games.
[2:45:57] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus he can hug closer to the body without getting hurt when he turns
[2:46:00] <%mikeiskill> tbh, I kinda just remember standing inside seath's tentacle ass on all my playthroughs

[2:46:23] <$eco419> @a_german_spy why don’t you believe in Reggy spy D:
[2:46:25] <%Prevot> @deeriojim lol no
[2:46:29] <DrkJP520> I think the music is appropriate.
[2:46:35] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus Chloranthy Ring & Grass Crest are great for this fight since you have to do so much chasing
[2:46:40] <%A_German_spy> @eco419 I do believe in him. After, and only after, he's got the tail cut.
[2:46:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:46:42] <+Jiggisnipe> yea it's appropriate
[2:46:45] <+TopTieramisu> the tail is so janky
[2:46:45] <radiorosewater> well.
[2:46:45] <%hukurowl> @DrkJP520 it's appropriate sure, but still bad
[2:46:46] <Jaxnos> is this what the final boss in the nursing home looks like?
[2:46:51] <%Ensign_Epic> @deeriojim Probably not. You gotta mess with AI repeatedly to get DLC tail; ideally with Seath you stun & cut, which tends to be pretty reliable.
[2:46:54] <%A_German_spy> @eco419 Because before that, he's going to die trying to get it.

[2:47:14] <AsinPersuasion> the path of attrition
[2:47:18] <Owlboy7> he should probably equip the stamina shield
[2:47:19] <+Awkward_Cyborg> just the tip
[2:47:19] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Reggie has Mask of the Child, right? Does that stack with grass crest shield and cloranthy ring?
[2:47:20] <slackerunchained> Seath needs more Cowbell

[2:47:28] <+Shady_Zaku> For a legless Bitch he sure moves A LOT
[2:47:30] <$eco419> @a_german_spy true Seath is a free boss
[2:47:34] <Equirah> @ncr7wms3r22b7n3 all 3 stack
[2:47:49] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> @Equirah nice
[2:47:51] <AsinPersuasion> its so wacky watching seethe clip through fuckin everything lol
[2:47:51] <Blank9> The tail is the true boss
[2:47:52] <%A_German_spy> @eco419 That's just it. Once Reggie no longer has to worry about the tail, the rest of the fight is practically free.
[2:47:53] <Dabrikishaw> Whelp. there goes 17,000 of my points
[2:47:54] <legacy0117> Still don’t know how Seathe is half-Dragon half-Squid.
[2:47:54] <%Ensign_Epic> @ncr7wms3r22b7n3 and then you can eat some weed for even more
[2:47:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> come off NotLikeThis
[2:47:58] <AsinPersuasion> you hardly notice it when you're playing
[2:47:59] <deeriojim> Reggie is hitting to far up the tail again, I think
[2:48:01] <0rnan> Since he's blind you'd think you could distract him with a skull or a distraction spell and then nip his tail.
[2:48:03] <%Prevot> you can probably count on one hand which DS1 bosses AREN'T free

[2:49:11] <jett_eyes> hes got it this time tho
[2:49:11] <+Grayhammatter> YOOOOO
[2:49:13] <$eco419> Reggy wants blood
[2:49:14] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I've almost recouped my losses from earlier sessions
[2:49:14] <+Awkward_Cyborg> best INT weapon
[2:49:17] <+Grayhammatter> LETS GO
[2:49:20] <twoah> It’s perfect for his build honestly
[2:49:21] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Take a look at the sword that's in nearly every From Soft game
[2:49:22] <peachy996> good job seathe!
[2:49:22] <Razeino> Upgrade that shit
[2:49:25] <%Mathochism> Reggie's new best friend Moonlight Greatsword.
[2:49:26] <velgaduere> GOES UP TO S
[2:49:28] <%Theycallmenerf> USE THE sword
[2:49:29] <slackerunchained> I believe, if you enchant this with magic, it swaps to PURE magic damage. No physical.
[2:49:29] <dizimous> Aaaaaah...My guiding moonlight....
[2:49:30] <AsinPersuasion> whats reggie's build?
[2:49:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> das a big letter
[2:49:31] <%seydaq> We MLG now
[2:49:32] <deeriojim> oh right, I thought it scaled with both INT and STR
[2:49:35] <%Ensign_Epic> @420moneymoney69 Bro, we're talking about in-game items XD, weed is Green Blossom.
[2:49:36] <pepinillomaton> THE OG
[2:49:42] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @slackerunchained it already is all magic
[2:49:46] <$eco419> PridePog og

[2:49:51] <JdotSweapA> STRAIGHT OUTTA KING'S FIELD
[2:49:51] <wantedsafe471> Not really the og, demons souls and kings field
[2:49:51] <%leith_aziz> pickyThink
[2:49:52] <AthenaAegis> THE sword that's been around since King's Field and Armored Core
[2:49:55] <Jaxnos> if you could reinforce this real quick, killing seath with his own tail would be funny af
[2:49:58] <%NahmenJayden> including Armored Core!
[2:49:58] <+Jiggisnipe> like Patches
[2:49:59] <oda_flobunaga> Onmori no Getsurugi
[2:50:00] <%leith_aziz> Oh, really?
[2:50:01] <nxflre> *almost every game
[2:50:03] <+mechslayer71> not sekiro tho I don't think
[2:50:03] <%Ensign_Epic> MLGS LET'S GO
[2:50:03] <%theoldone001> Except Sekiro
[2:50:04] <oak120> this thing is badass in Armoured Core
[2:50:04] <+Slattsquatch> Not Sekiro
[2:50:05] <+TopTieramisu> except sekiro
[2:50:06] <%NahmenJayden> remember Armored Core? T_T
[2:50:11] <sendart> no str scaling period so it's probably worse than the pole lol
[2:50:12] <Aussie_Manny> Oh right, not Sekiro.
[2:50:12] <DukeBlack_> @theoldone001 the dragon has it
[2:50:13] <TheyCallMeVawn> It was in Armored Core
[2:50:14] <%ozzrabbit> That is my signature weapon in pretty much all my SoulsBorne characters.
[2:50:14] <kvassimoto> Sigmature
[2:50:15] <%DashXero> It's even in Armored Core
[2:50:16] <jett_eyes> except Sekiro, yeah
[2:50:17] <Bromosap1ens> @mechslayer71 Divine Dragon wierlds it
[2:50:17] <+itsKrisD> dragon boss has the moonlight greatsword
[2:50:17] <$eco419> It was the shiny sword
[2:50:18] <%Ensign_Epic> GUIDING MOONLIGHT
[2:50:19] <OblivionSword1> even in armored core
[2:50:19] <+Grayhammatter> except sekiro
[2:50:19] <%ThePich> Reggie VS King's FIeld when
[2:50:20] <@Solidus_113> armoured core even
[2:50:21] <Lefteron> except Sekiro I believe
[2:50:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> The Cid of weapons
[2:50:25] <AsinPersuasion> wait its unironically in armored core? thats sick
[2:50:29] <Mitchellsocks> Activison is anti Moonlight Sword Sadge Sekiro
[2:50:33] <peachy996> it's the best in BB
[2:50:34] <%Ensign_Epic> Freaking METAL WOLF CHAOS has the MLGS
[2:50:36] <+mechslayer71> @bromosap1ens even tho it looks nothing like it?
[2:50:37] <+itsKrisD> The dragon boss has the sword in sekiro
[2:50:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's also in Metal Wolf Chaos
[2:50:39] <%hukurowl> but FUCK sekiro
[2:50:40] <%jinking79> yeah the Dragon boss in Sekiro using the Moomlight sword
[2:50:42] <Slim_Lipid> middling black sheep Sekiro
[2:50:47] <$eco419> PridePog PridePog PridePog
[2:50:47] <+Grayhammatter> peep that
[2:50:50] <slackerunchained> Ironically, this is the worst zone to test the weapon, as everything here is so magic-resistant.
[2:50:53] <+eggstyr0ne> moonlight greatsword in in sekiro
[2:50:55] <Aussie_Manny> Try it out, Ichigo.
[2:50:55] <Bromosap1ens> @mechslayer71 Shoots, beams, same color. Wielded by a dragon. It fits
[2:50:56] <+Rafraud> Sekiro SUCKS
[2:50:58] <brunoberserk> need some dragon scales
[2:50:59] <peachy996> I'm not surprised its not in Sekiro because how can you top that moment in BB?
[2:50:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it even glows in bloodborne and DS3
[2:51:02] <yukichocomilk> looks coolest in bloodborne
[2:51:04] <+NeddTheNerd> chat are they using mods? why does it look 100x better than ds2 ?
[2:51:04] <+Grayhammatter> it do be a sword
[2:51:06] <Mitchellsocks> Sekiro is fucking great
[2:51:07] <$eco419> Sword
[2:51:08] <+Slattsquatch> Bloodborne has the best MLGS
[2:51:08] <Dabrikishaw> That's PURE magic damage coming from the MGS as opposed to the split damage from the Titanite Pole
[2:51:08] <+kevlarkoala> this is the only time where i'm like "maybe make him use this" lol
[2:51:12] <SaiyanShoto> No moonlight sword is another reason why Sekiro is one of FromSofts weakest games
[2:51:16] <%seydaq> is it in the tenchu games
[2:51:19] <AsinPersuasion> hadoken
[2:51:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEAAAAAAAAAA

[2:52:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> oh shit
[2:52:08] <+Bitscreed> Reggarth is now the perfect fusion of Link and Ganon.
[2:52:12] <Aussie_Manny> oooohhhhh, so durability is the currency
[2:52:12] <Slim_Lipid> more than half EleGiggle
[2:52:13] <JdotSweapA> NOW im a little MOTIVATED
[2:52:14] <KellBeII> theres a spell that repairs weapons that can offset it
[2:52:15] <%leith_aziz> pickyFight doodBeam
[2:52:15] <Matt_Cowdery> I think it has 5 uses before it breaks
[2:52:16] <%seydaq> now repair it!
[2:52:21] <%brandt_connors> you can repair it for free by upgrading it
[2:52:24] <LunarRemix> It's one of the best weapons for Intelligence characters like Reggie's
[2:52:26] <Aussie_Manny> And over in Bloodborne, silver bullets are the currency.
[2:52:27] <Awesome_Leaf> LEVEL THAT SHIT UP BOIII
[2:52:29] <deeriojim> repair powder isnt that expensive

[2:52:48] <%AbnormalVoid> isn't it Dragon Scales?
[2:52:50] <velgaduere> scaling goes up to S
[2:52:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> isn't it scales for this?
[2:52:51] <Lefteron> It needs scales
[2:52:51] <%Vigonept> it uses scales
[2:52:52] <KellBeII> it takes dragon scales to upgrade
[2:52:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dragon Scale actuall
[2:52:53] <%hukurowl> DO IT

[2:55:53] <+ElDragon_1> Woolie knows how to fight the blind
[2:55:59] <dundore77> who needs defense if he cant see or hit you
[2:56:02] <+tempestzephyr> feet
[2:56:04] <Matt_Cowdery> blind people HATE fire
[2:56:11] <%Ensign_Epic> Lots of people don't think about this one. Also helps with a specific notable not-boss later, if you're a bad person
[2:56:12] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Local Undead Cruelly Beats Up Blind, Unassuming Dragon
[2:56:14] <DrkJP520> How do people even get cursed here?
[2:56:16] <deeriojim> the Channeler set provides some curse resist
[2:56:21] <deeriojim> IIRC
[2:56:28] <dizimous> Bury that light
[2:56:29] <%Juriasu> aim for his weakspot for massive damage
[2:56:30] <%seydaq> curse only gets you after you die
[2:56:33] <%A_German_spy> @DrkJP520 They get trapped against a wall in his AoE
[2:56:35] <GreyFoxHoundDD> You could give him a shadow puzzle to do, that stopped a blind person once
[2:56:45] <vivaciouseff> inb4 cursed
[2:56:47] <Jaxnos> break the thing first re-
[2:56:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @GreyFoxHoundDD lol
[2:56:53] <+Grayhammatter> doesn't remember?
[2:56:55] <zhenthrim213> idoit
[2:57:04] <%patriotrenegade> aw noooo my crystaaaaaaal
[2:57:05] <+twohitgood> only thing that doesn't really hurt him is magic.
[2:57:11] <+TopTieramisu> i forget, how does seath handle lightning?
[2:57:12] <Jaxnos> yeehaw
[2:57:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @TopTieramisu poorly
[2:57:19] <oak120> magic can work, but hes quite resistant
[2:57:23] <DirtyMerlin> @zhenthrim213 u do what?
[2:57:24] <deeriojim> @TopTieramisu poorly
[2:57:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> dragons hate magic
[2:57:31] <SoaringTrumpet> ouch
[2:57:34] <%seydaq> is seaths face a weakpoint?
[2:57:35] <%CateHecate> oh man, he kinda laughs like smough
[2:57:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> No crystal?
[2:57:39] <+TopTieramisu> considering gwyn owned the everlasting dragons with lighting, i figured
[2:57:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Dragons hate lightning*
[2:57:44] <youngking_kush> @reverend_roscoe No Dragons hate Lightning
[2:57:46] <Razeino> How does it feel Seath? To be a bitch.
[2:57:48] <DeathByPoke7> he is a bitch
[2:57:51] <%patriotrenegade> His front is the best spot
[2:57:52] <%leith_aziz> pickySad
[2:57:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lock on is making this harder
[2:57:55] <Bromosap1ens> Lightning does well just about against anything in Dark Souls 1
[2:57:55] <Slim_Lipid> turbo-herpes
[2:57:56] <%strakillias> Paige the dragon
[2:57:56] <+Mendin> But he is still an Ancient Dragon
[2:57:57] <zhenthrim213> CRIPPLE FIGHT
[2:57:58] <%patriotrenegade> But he's still a dragon
[2:57:59] <deeriojim> Seath got that booty stank game, AND he knows how to twerk!
[2:58:01] <radiorosewater> ...
[2:58:01] <%CateHecate> SNUFF THAT PUP
[2:58:05] <%theoldone001> Bullying a disabled dragon
[2:58:06] <keohtv> and the greatest sorcerer of that era
[2:58:08] <oda_flobunaga> Mr. Burns no Ryu
[2:58:15] <+Shady_Zaku> Lllllightning!
[2:58:15] <ocean_fran> gotta collect that inheritance
[2:58:23] <%MooseIsGoose> just hit the side
[2:58:24] <Jaxnos> show this geriatric dragon with no health insurance who's boss
[2:58:28] <%Deekman> that was bullshit lol
[2:58:31] <+Iamdenril> the disabled dragon bullying him
[2:58:35] <+Shady_Zaku> That AOE is sum buuullshiiit
[2:58:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> go seath
[2:58:40] <%Qsmash_> is the ring working?
[2:58:43] <%Finnmac5> He aint even got legs....
[2:58:43] <Equirah> Let's go seath!
[2:58:45] <%Reverend_Roscoe> oh no my points
[2:58:52] <KellBeII> dunno if the ring has an effect on this boss
[2:58:54] <%Prevot> Just hit his dick reggie
[2:58:56] <%Ensign_Epic> The ring is doing exactly what it's supposed to do
[2:58:58] <+esoteric_simp> lessgo 3 sips
[2:59:00] <+AceNugget> Seath did hear him talk mad shit earlier tho
[2:59:02] <deeriojim> im not sure the ring has an effect on him yea
[2:59:02] <velgaduere> L O L
[2:59:05] <Razeino> To bad Reggie doesn't have any spells to shoot at Seath. Not like he's a mage or anything.
[2:59:08] <pepinillomaton> I BELIEVE!
[2:59:09] <%theoldone001> Why he ain't kindle that bonfire yet tho?
[2:59:10] <ericbritsman> go for the groin
[2:59:11] <%NahmenJayden> I think I ended up cheesing it with arrows. his AI derped and didn't attack me
[2:59:11] <youngking_kush> You can literally just face tank him
[2:59:12] <deeriojim> out of range
[2:59:15] <DrkJP520> Get his tail again. For fun.
[2:59:16] <%townzzzzz> hit it until it dies
[2:59:17] <%vVAstrAVv> its best to just fight him in front Reggie
[2:59:18] <Bromosap1ens> he invented that shit, he's beyond it
[2:59:19] <%Ensign_Epic> You could tell from that swipe Seath did when Reggie was no longer there.
[2:59:21] <yukichocomilk> illusionist, michael
[2:59:24] <mothdude> Reggie been trained too hard to go to the most dangerous part of the boss
[2:59:25] <radiorosewater> !FAITH AT RISK!
[2:59:27] <velgaduere> @theoldone001 he won't need it if he learns the fight better
[2:59:27] <%NahmenJayden> yeah, give him the boot!
[2:59:32] <+Bitscreed> Kick him in the drussy, Reggie.
[2:59:35] <+Double_Tap_That> Punch his dick!
[2:59:36] <%seydaq> the only time you want to dont get the back
[2:59:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> Boop his Snoot
[2:59:38] <%CateHecate> he's like if Lo-Pan was a dragon
[2:59:44] <zhenthrim213> doo doo dee de do da dee dee
[2:59:52] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Bitscreed UGGH, thanks for that, Jesus
[2:59:56] <pepinillomaton> Reggie is hollowing
[2:59:58] <+twohitgood> punch him in the dick
[2:59:59] <Aussie_Manny> Was there ever a "crystal bender" in Avatar?
[3:00:00] <dundore77> the soundless ring doesn't seem to do anything
[3:00:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> simply beat the ass
[3:00:03] <+Bitscreed> @Bitscreed You're welcome. ;P
[3:00:08] <OblivionSword1> kick him till he's dead
[3:00:08] <+TopTieramisu> the tail is probably the only way seath is killing reggie
[3:00:12] <DirtyMerlin> we going all the ways boys
[3:00:14] <Bromosap1ens> Reggie is so respectful. He refuses to just run up in this guy's dick and SWING
[3:00:14] <+Mendin> @Aussie_Manny King Bumi?
[3:00:21] <MeImoth> lol the fact that to get these kick Reggies has to be habitually flicking the stick forward is somehow really funny to me, because I have never played anything that would give me such a habit
[3:00:24] <velgaduere> why the tail still
[3:00:29] <velgaduere> why
[3:00:31] <Aussie_Manny> @Mendin That was rock candy! LUL
[3:00:32] <%Reverend_Roscoe> forget the tail man
[3:00:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> locate the ass and beat it
[3:00:35] <+mechslayer71> @aussie_manny bumi did it, and so did aang in the season 2 finale. they're just rocks
[3:00:36] <Matt_Cowdery> straid lesson: FOOLISH undead...
[3:00:38] <slackerunchained> @velgaduere Cause Reggie is nervous.
[3:00:40] <%HeroToxiko> i haven't seen his beam fire directly down but that tail be swanging
[3:00:42] <%Qsmash_> you don't really have to keep running behind him at this point
[3:00:43] <glass_marcus> Reggie stay away from that back tail
[3:00:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:00:44] <yukichocomilk> hit him in the dick
[3:00:44] <+Slattsquatch> @Aussie_Manny Wasn't there crystal bending in the S2 finale or am I misremembering
[3:00:45] <deeriojim> I think Reggie is fearing some sort of grab
[3:00:46] <+TopTieramisu> reggie is afraid to go toe to toe. so he's punching at seath's fist
[3:00:50] <%vVAstrAVv> reggie you HAVE the tail just murder him
[3:00:53] <oda_flobunaga> Lo-Pan, Superman, and Every Single Power Ranger. Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan, Spock Doc Ock and Hulk Hogan
[3:00:53] <DrkJP520> Gotta watch out when he ponders his orb.
[3:00:55] <%Prevot> reggie really struggles when the catch pole damage isn't carrying him
[3:00:56] <Slim_Lipid> TWIST HIS DICK
[3:00:56] <%AbnormalVoid> hit him in the front butt
[3:00:57] <%holydeviant1> Woolie, he's ALL ass!

[3:05:41] <deeriojim> will Reggie beat the tree on his first try now?

[3:05:50] <+OutOfJambread> reggie be shoppin

[3:05:57] <%Ensign_Epic> So, fun aside. My iguana's name is Seath & up until this year, he's never known it as anything but his name. So he's sorta freaking out in the other room, wondering why 2 people he doesn't know are yelling at & about him. Also, yes, he is every much as big a dickhead as his namesake
[3:05:58] <%Lion_kun> take the level and spend the rest on shopping
[3:06:06] <%seydaq> and drake farmin
[3:06:07] <%Reverend_Roscoe> he ain't done, he still has to finish Logans quest @woolieversus

[3:06:13] <lotharrio> Spells or upgrade that new sword
[3:06:18] <LunarRemix> If he wants to swing the Moonlight Greatsword then it's not a bad idea to up his INT
[3:06:27] <Bromosap1ens> I have never ever done Logan's Quest
[3:06:28] <velgaduere> @Ensign_Epic iguanas recognize name calls? that's wild
[3:06:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> Upgrade that sword son

[3:06:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ensign_Epic idk if iguanas like pats but if they do give him a lil pat for me
[3:06:38] <oda_flobunaga> @deeriojim to do that, you need to know where the floor is going to break beforehand so NO Way IN Hell

[3:12:51] <+cdrom321> @drkjp520 They already I'd.
[3:12:51] <+foomaster22> Popping it gives you 5 humanity amd a heal
[3:12:52] <DrkJP520> sweet
[3:12:55] <+Mendin> Homing Crystal?
[3:12:55] <+Shishi1205> you havent put the crystal one
[3:12:57] <+NotVeryLegendary> he could use a ring to give more slots
[3:12:59] <Allen_33> he doesnt want the serpent stank
[3:13:01] <%seydaq> does reggiw have repair spell?
[3:13:05] <+cdrom321> @drkjp520 They already did.
[3:13:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[3:13:09] <%Prevot> welp
[3:13:09] <DedlokPM> @foomaster22 you could but it would be a waste when you are still able to use it to upgrade your flask
[3:13:11] <sendart> grind time
[3:13:11] <%MooseIsGoose> It sucks
[3:13:16] <Lefteron> Why not?
[3:13:18] <%Irridium> but you get his hat!
[3:13:22] <deadseascrolldier> Thats regular homing soulmass not crystal
[3:13:23] <%theoldone001> I mean, he drops a catalyst but whatever I guess
[3:13:23] <DirtyMerlin> casual souls Kappa
[3:13:23] <+vaderxyz1970> if its not happening you could always get his hat
[3:13:25] <%vVAstrAVv> but you get a GOOOOOOOD ASSSSS catalist
[3:13:25] <klooswep> Let's just casually farm up like, 200K, it's no problem Kappa
[3:13:26] <youngking_kush> You get the best spell and his gear that way
[3:13:28] <deeriojim> aw, the Painted World grind for that doesnt take very long though
[3:13:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> It costs a lot and he can just look it up online
[3:13:30] <KellBeII> theres lots of game left, im sure you guys could get it if you really wanted
[3:13:31] <%Lion_kun> But you get a unique spell if you do it.
[3:13:32] <%fat_burtreynolds> Nothing wrong with a lil Bump & Griiiind
[3:13:34] <%MooseIsGoose> but you get his hat
[3:13:42] <+vaderxyz1970> Its a nice hat
[3:13:42] <+retro_godfather> that quest style reminds me of the merchant from castlevania 64 LUL
[3:13:47] <%fat_burtreynolds> SO IVE BEEN LVLING OFF STREAM
[3:13:47] <+devonoel> go get great combustion, thats a good spell
[3:13:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> CHECKPOINT
[3:13:49] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus white breath tho
[3:13:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat relax they're not gonna see 100% of the game
[3:13:51] <%paladinstarbuster> MGS
[3:13:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> has that texture loaded yet?
[3:13:53] <%Irridium> yes, it is a long, wasteful grind. but consider: big hat
[3:13:59] <+Shishi1205> Only one chest missing to finish the area @WoolieVersus
[3:14:00] <%Lion_kun> It's the best spell in the game
[3:14:00] <youngking_kush> @mooseisgoose The real reward are his robes, they're the best mage gear
[3:14:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> BUT WHAT IF IT LOOKED COOL THO
[3:14:04] <%seydaq> that spell sucks
[3:14:06] <sendart> best catalyst
[3:14:10] <%MooseIsGoose> Its like 200,00 souls
[3:14:12] <Lefteron> And lore
[3:14:12] <AncyentMarinere> Unless you do the money glitch PogChamp
[3:14:15] <%linSP> PogChamp
[3:14:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> The hat?
[3:14:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> You get that hat, right?
[3:14:17] <%MooseIsGoose> 200,000
[3:14:19] <%vVAstrAVv> best catalist to nuke things
[3:14:20] <Bromosap1ens> grinding phalanx in painted world is EZ
[3:14:20] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah, and just telling Reggie to grind in the Painted World opens up the issue of why not just grind forever in the PW?
[3:14:21] <Equirah> most of his other spells are cheap
[3:14:21] <GHouseduivel> 183,000 souls required for all his spells
[3:14:22] <%Ensign_Epic> And fight a naked man.
[3:14:22] <%Irridium> but big hat!
[3:14:23] <yukichocomilk> how about not doing that
[3:14:24] <brunoberserk> if you just kill logan now , he drops the items ? i forgot
[3:14:24] <Slim_Lipid> just cheat it in once he hits NG+
[3:14:26] <Aussie_Manny> !uptime
[3:14:26] <deeriojim> the painted world soul grind is like, less than half an hour for ALL of Logans items
[3:14:26] <@Moobot> @Aussie_Manny WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 26 minutes
[3:14:31] <Overloard> reggie not a completionist
[3:14:32] <%Ensign_Epic> Don't forget about fighting the naked man!
[3:14:33] <Razeino> And the best Catalyst in the game
[3:14:38] <deadseascrolldier> "embers"
[3:14:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i look forward to the next few streams of people asking if he's gonna buy all of logan's items LUL
[3:14:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:14:48] <KyberNasse> HE DOESNT WANT THE HAT REEEE
[3:14:50] <Nitsuj293> Chat trying to get quests done like the results matter LUL
[3:14:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[3:14:59] <%Deekman> the rest of them are in your flask
[3:15:01] <OldOnyx> Meh, the highest damage catalyst overall... that halves the total uses of each spell
[3:15:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> onion waifu

[3:15:24] <+Slattsquatch> I love her voice coming out of that armor
[3:15:25] <%seydaq> not all catarinans look the same
[3:15:28] <sendart> don't need full cast amount if you kill things in one shot
[3:15:34] <deeriojim> coulda said yes if you wanted to I think
[3:15:35] <pixel_river> kind onion lady
[3:15:35] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus you want a yes there
[3:15:35] <Artiamus> He's heading down to Izalith currently
[3:15:42] <+Awkward_Cyborg> time to return to demon ruins...

[3:15:55] <deeriojim> I dont recall if it changes anything though
[3:16:03] <youngking_kush> Not the Tin Crystal Catalyst, Logans actual Catalyst
[3:16:03] <+Shishi1205> woops
[3:16:06] <Treasure_Vault> I think that might have ended her quest, but i'm not sure
[3:16:07] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[3:16:08] <+SilverDevilfish> "Y-Yeah, link the fire"
[3:16:09] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus seeing him in blighttown near the ash tree counts as seeing him
[3:16:11] <%megaman_sentinel> will it tho
[3:16:13] <dalmek> yeah totally
[3:16:14] <%Juriasu> nah fuck the fire
[3:16:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Poor thing
[3:16:16] <+Jiggisnipe> yes I'm linking the fire Kappa totally
[3:16:17] <Overloard> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:20] <%tigerfang86> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:23] <gryffinp> reason enough to reject kaathe: she wants to be saved
[3:16:23] <LordOfThePoultry> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dying human is good
[3:16:28] <%Irridium> yeah sure Kappa
[3:16:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> So she can die, period
[3:16:31] <%seydaq> bitterShook
[3:16:34] <kvassimoto> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:42] <tomo_vendor> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:44] <Treasure_Vault> I think saying No ends Sieglinde's stuff, according to fextralife.
[3:16:45] <%tigerfang86> I mean being a firekeeper sucks
[3:16:50] <SoaringTrumpet> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:53] <%seydaq> bitterSweat link the fire?

[3:18:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> *Insane Gibbering*
[3:19:09] <%gulthrax> Logan's Meth lab
[3:19:13] <LunarRemix> You can just talk to her again when you reload the area
[3:19:14] <+vaderxyz1970> Big Hat Logan is that Research Professor that never leaves their lab
[3:19:20] <brunoberserk> '' i dont know , man , i think his sniffing TOO MUCH CRYSTAL ''
[3:19:20] <%MooseIsGoose> I think you are good.
[3:19:22] <Equirah> you can go talk to her again
[3:19:23] <%seydaq> just a hop and a skip passed sens funhouse
[3:19:28] <+Shishi1205> leave
[3:19:30] <deeriojim> I think you can ask her again, it seems like the question gives another chance
[3:19:32] <velgaduere> UH OH
[3:19:33] <%Ensign_Epic> NO
[3:19:33] <Awesome_Leaf> NO
[3:19:34] <+Shishi1205> I love doing that
[3:19:34] <+Jiggisnipe> tbh Sieg quest is kinda annoying
[3:19:35] <%Juriasu> we understand but woolieONEGUY will never forgive
[3:19:41] <+cdrom321> Can't you find him and then tell her.
[3:19:41] <+Shishi1205> Just run from conversations
[3:19:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> "it's for your own good"
[3:19:44] <%Ensign_Epic> SAY NO LAWRENCE IS THE BOI
[3:19:50] <%DashXero> AWWWW....
[3:19:51] <%MooseIsGoose> I think she asks again after you see him but I understand.
[3:19:52] <Jaysky> It's for the best
[3:19:53] <slackerunchained> It'd be pretty damn unlikely to complete all character questlines on playthrough #1, anyway...
[3:19:54] <velgaduere> @Juriasu one guy will die mad
[3:19:55] <%DashXero> But... But....
[3:19:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bless you lawrence
[3:20:00] <%theoldone001> Trying to get Siegmeyer to live is a hassle to begin with so no big deal tbh
[3:20:06] <%gulthrax> shes a BBW
[3:20:07] <%linSP> no Lawrence you shall live
[3:20:10] <LunarRemix> You have to reload the area
[3:20:15] <%Ensign_Epic> I think someone said reload, so that may change it
[3:20:18] <slackerunchained> Fear the Old Blood, lawrence...
[3:20:20] <%MooseIsGoose> It does not
[3:20:22] <youngking_kush> You can say no here its fine
[3:20:23] <%tigerfang86> it doesn't
[3:20:31] <derap41> Woolie gotta explore the swamp now
[3:20:33] <%gulthrax> grant us pies, grant us PIES!
[3:20:37] <brunoberserk> its okay ,woolz , this sidequest is bullshit anyway
[3:20:38] <%seydaq> this quest is flexible
[3:20:43] <gryffinp> why we heading to anor londo today?
[3:20:45] <+ItalianWaifu> One Guy is loosing his mind right now
[3:20:48] <%tigerfang86> Multiple Guys moment
[3:20:50] <+Shishi1205> That quest is a fuck. i dont blame anyone
[3:20:54] <deeriojim> yeah leaving the area might let you get to say Yes to her. Ultimately I think you just miss out on a Miracle
[3:21:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Is reggie going to whip out that sword soon?
[3:21:11] <gryffinp> oh right the smith
[3:21:12] <%Ensign_Epic> This sidequest is super fucky, yeah. ESPECIALLY the upcoming part in izalith
[3:21:13] <Bromosap1ens> I'm dreading all the weird and hard to solve quests Elden Ring will have
[3:21:13] <deeriojim> and some extra lore dialogue
[3:21:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> one guy is turning into a glowing red skull now
[3:21:22] <Overloard> is reggie a woman respecter this playthrough?
[3:21:28] <%Juriasu> upgrading armor DansGame

[3:21:35] <zhenthrim213> @Bromosap1ens im fucking excited for those
[3:21:35] <OldOnyx> most of the total BS I can think of in this game in particular is in Siegmeyer's quest. Making things happen the way they should is nonsense inside of nonsense
[3:21:35] <+Bitscreed> YEAH!
[3:21:38] <%notsoy> this is reggie, not paige, women are respected here
[3:21:40] <%tigerfang86> SON OF THE BOAR

[3:22:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Bromosap1ens to get ending R you gotta talk to scrimblo brimblo BEFORE you reach the 2nd zone but AFTER defeating THAT guy, or else you get ending J, and NO ONE wants ending J
[3:22:25] <slackerunchained> Bearer, Seek, Seek, Lest
[3:22:33] <Overloard> i wonder if dispelling the illusion of gwynevere is respectful

[3:23:22] <+Shishi1205> With more int yes
[3:23:24] <%Lion_kun> It surpasses it
[3:23:26] <dundore77> this only does magic damage catchpole does 2 types
[3:23:26] <pi_in_the_sci> it takes 10 dragon scales to max a dragon weapon
[3:23:26] <%paladinstarbuster> more than rival
[3:23:30] <Jaxnos> reggie got a lot of scales
[3:23:31] <Blank9> The best
[3:23:31] <%holydeviant1> It's an excellent backup for armored enemies.

[3:23:41] <%jonblnt> you can always have both
[3:23:42] <%Lion_kun> go farm now
[3:23:45] <Bromosap1ens> @velgaduere Don't forget to not turn in ANY scrungus tokens or scrimblo's suster will aggro
[3:23:47] <sendart> enchanted garb halbred would probably be better than both lol
[3:23:52] <Blank9> Better than catchpole fully upgraded
[3:23:55] <%theoldone001> Reggie the Catchpole has some very dark connotations
[3:23:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Bromosap1ens LUL
[3:23:58] <xXxPS9xXx> tap...tap...tap...tap-t-tap-tap-tap
[3:24:03] <derap41> Higher magic but not total
[3:24:05] <velgaduere> @Bromosap1ens NOT THE SUSTER hotsamWait
[3:24:05] <%seydaq> with sub 40 int tho
[3:24:10] <lotharrio> The big difference would be that the catch pole does physical, but the MGS is pure magic.
[3:24:11] <gryffinp> totals from different types of damage aren't as good as one number, for complex stupid reasons
[3:24:12] <youngking_kush> Remember Catchpole is at mac
[3:24:13] <+Shishi1205> big blue
[3:24:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Also it's only hitting one resistance
[3:24:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> acquire big number
[3:24:22] <deadseascrolldier> Split damage is usually worse
[3:24:32] <velgaduere> 10k ain't shit
[3:24:32] <Jaxnos> don't fight nobody with magic resistance, ez
[3:24:36] <Overloard> worth
[3:24:37] <%Lion_kun> need 50k to max out
[3:24:38] <Lefteron> you have finished the magic area after all
[3:24:38] <%holydeviant1> Catch pole currently does 518 combined.
[3:24:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> Broke the scale
[3:24:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im fairly sure he's past the magic resistant enemies, mostly
[3:24:43] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So the advantage to the Moonlight Greatsword here is that since it deals pure magic damage, it only has to go through one type of defense, unlike the Catch Pole which has to go through two. As long as the target isn't strong against magic, the MLGS may deal more damage overall.
[3:24:45] <xXxPS9xXx> big magic bois
[3:24:46] <brunoberserk> oh man , I wonder how the moonlight greatsword will be in elden ring
[3:24:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> Hell, a few runs in the forest will grind that up easy
[3:24:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> wait wut. split damage is worse?
[3:24:52] <cheapdoc> S scaling
[3:24:54] <+Shishi1205> The best farming spot is on painted. I strongly recommend getting the silver ring
[3:24:56] <derap41> 7 farming runs in Painted World
[3:24:57] <%holydeviant1> MLGS will break that around +3
[3:25:08] <%Theycallmenerf> Farm painted phalanx
[3:25:08] <%seydaq> @Reverend_Roscoe sadly yes
[3:25:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> that's dumb
[3:25:18] <Overloard> yeah +1 to +5 is always 10 of the relevant shard
[3:25:19] <derap41> Almost no enemies are strong against magic
[3:25:21] <+Jiggisnipe> how many things have magic resistance?
[3:25:27] <+Jiggisnipe> alright thank you
[3:25:28] <velgaduere> catchpole against magic bois, MLGS against everything else
[3:25:30] <%Ensign_Epic> MLGS max should wind up beating Catchpole, eventually
[3:25:31] <catasteroid0> Also a note: Two handing it doesn't increase damage, as it has no strength scaling
[3:25:34] <%fat_burtreynolds> Crystal boys
[3:25:35] <%holydeviant1> @derap41 And guess whre they all live~~~
[3:25:37] <%linSP> woolie is strong against magic
[3:25:37] <%A_German_spy> @Jiggisnipe Not too many, as I recall.
[3:25:37] <%jinking79> it can cut down annoying Orphans
[3:25:44] <slackerunchained> Lotta things are more-geared for physical resist than magic, tho...
[3:25:51] <+Jiggisnipe> @A_German_spy I figured as much, thank you
[3:25:52] <derap41> @Jiggisnipe Most of them are in The Dukes Archive
[3:26:01] <dundore77> but you dont have build for it
[3:26:06] <vivaciouseff> @catasteroid0 i think that's only true in DS3, two-handing increase damage regardless of scaling in the other games
[3:26:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus 2 handing won't increase damage on the MLGS
[3:26:09] <%seydaq> @Jiggisnipe not sure about dlc
[3:26:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @derap41 thought so, thanks
[3:26:25] <Awesome_Leaf> time = money
[3:26:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Use the mugensouls website to map it out
[3:26:31] <%Ensign_Epic> Archives & Crystal Caves are sorta the magic resistant areas of the game, so MLGS should rip through most things.
[3:26:56] <%theoldone001> Velka could be a side weapon to the MLGS
[3:27:08] <Overloard> the cosplay titanite LUL
[3:27:09] <velgaduere> seems like a clear choice
[3:27:13] <derap41> Twinkling is the easiest t ofarm anyway
[3:27:16] <%A_German_spy> @Jiggisnipe No worries. I remember it being mostly the crystal golems and the enemies in the Archives that resist magic, and maybe a handful of others elsewhere.
[3:27:21] <dundore77> clearly the boar helm
[3:27:26] <OldManDeckardCain> reforge your badass helmet with a bunch of twinks
[3:27:27] <Awesome_Leaf> hes not gonna use velkas anyway
[3:27:31] <Jaxnos> Velka is almost done upgrading too, right? next thing is +5
[3:27:34] <dundore77> cause you could end up never going to use the rapier
[3:27:38] <%gulthrax> Pig POWAH
[3:27:39] <cs0402196> 1,1,2,2,4 for twink
[3:27:44] <Nitsuj293> could just prioritize the boar and moonlight for now
[3:27:49] <%holydeviant1> If I was playing this LP would get boring right now, as I go to horde enough souls to max out equipmeent
[3:27:51] <+Jiggisnipe> @seydaq guess I have to do some research
[3:27:51] <Aussie_Manny> Shining Hero: Can't Stop Twinkling
[3:27:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> I missed so much somewhere. I never knew he upgraded Velka's Rapier, nor that he was even using the thing
[3:28:03] <derap41> Smashing lots of clams for that
[3:28:09] <%theoldone001> Velka is already at 4, might as well finish it
[3:28:12] <glass_marcus> you only need 4 more for velkas
[3:28:28] <dundore77> @KeiganOfAstora he only used for for like a minute before going back to the pole
[3:28:29] <+Shishi1205> 4
[3:28:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> @dundore77 So why is he even bothering thinking about upgrading it?
[3:28:46] <%seydaq> @Jiggisnipe its eithey enemies got magic resist or player needs magic resist. memory is not clear
[3:28:48] <dundore77> idk
[3:28:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:28:48] <mihokspawn> Twinkle is 8k money, so its free
[3:28:51] <%gulthrax> why dont you back to your home on Boar Island?!
[3:29:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nothing to be sad about, it's a shit weapon
[3:29:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's just another pokey poke
[3:29:22] <+pandapeeps> Use it to shine his toenails
[3:29:34] <%Theycallmenerf> MLGS :3
[3:29:37] <lotharrio> Clam farm feels pretty easy.
[3:29:39] <+eanscrale> It's not that bad, but it is pretty outclassed in it's own weapon type
[3:29:42] <%BignanasTheGawd> need 100k souls to fully level up moonlight
[3:29:42] <radiorosewater> MGSV
[3:29:47] <%Lion_kun> I never ever bothered upgrading armor.
[3:29:49] <Nitsuj293> Our guiding moonlight
[3:29:51] <%BignanasTheGawd> 50K
[3:29:57] <%MooseIsGoose> 50 k
[3:30:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> You don't need to upgrade armor ever, but you can and it's fun
[3:30:02] <slackerunchained> It's the enchanted Falchion used back in DeS.
[3:30:12] <%vVAstrAVv> farm twinkling from crystal cave
[3:30:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @lion_kun +5 giant armor is pretty lit though
[3:30:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> *cringe*
[3:30:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Such a waste of twinkling wow
[3:30:28] <%vVAstrAVv> they drop like candy
[3:30:30] <%seydaq> one more great lord boss and youll have enough souls
[3:30:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> I know they're easy to farm but fuck
[3:30:39] <%Ensign_Epic> REGGARTH THE BOAR
[3:30:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie really likes that helmet, jeez LUL
[3:30:50] <Razeino> Or strasp on the mimic helm and the serpent ring and slaughter some clams for the twinkling/
[3:30:52] <%fat_burtreynolds> Sadly does not raise poise with upgrade
[3:30:53] <xXxPS9xXx> MOONLIGHT BOAR BOIS
[3:30:56] <Jaxnos> just gotta punch some clams
[3:30:56] <+Malysitos> Better damage absorption is always nice
[3:30:57] <LunarRemix> It's somewhat easy now farming from Seath's bonfire
[3:31:04] <+Jiggisnipe> true
[3:31:06] <Nitsuj293> Is it boss soul eating time?
[3:31:06] <%Indigo_Automaton> Use a Boss soul that he'll never use
[3:31:08] <dundore77> could just eat some boss souls that you wont use
[3:31:09] <Equirah> time to kill a firekeeper LUL
[3:31:09] <%fat_burtreynolds> Test out your crystal soul arrows
[3:31:09] <+SuperThorio> We're not even using twinkling for anything else lmao
[3:31:10] <%seydaq> plenty of chances
[3:31:11] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora It's less a waste than using it on Velka's, and what else is he gonna do with the Twinkling at this point? The only other weapon he's interested in upgrades with Dragon Scales.
[3:31:13] <mihokspawn> You can just buy twinkling
[3:31:18] <slackerunchained> "There goes my hero... soul..."
[3:31:19] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah Seath bonfire is a great farm for twinkling
[3:31:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> just do a couple runs through the painting and buy it
[3:31:25] <%FreshSquozeBreastMilk> just gonna waste those bosses
[3:31:27] <%gulthrax> woolie is a helicopter parent
[3:31:28] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Silver ring first before farming for better efficiency?
[3:31:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> @A_German_spy Use the twinkling on shields?
[3:31:40] <lotharrio> Clam farm to see if you get twinkling on top of it all?
[3:31:43] <Razeino> The clam farm is great for souls too
[3:31:43] <gryffinp> Really, this is why I don't use consumable souls to top up to get levels
[3:31:49] <velgaduere> and then try not to die!
[3:31:51] <%Ensign_Epic> Does he have silver ring? Thought he only had gold
[3:31:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> He doesn't have it yet
[3:31:54] <+Shishi1205> You can go get the ring
[3:31:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> His one chance was in the Tomb Of The Giants
[3:31:57] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora He barely uses shields despite carrying one around for comfort.
[3:31:58] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> Don't all those Boss souls you'll never use look rather yummy?
[3:32:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> @A_German_spy LUL

[3:32:27] <%IronOhki> It's really hard to consume unique souls four first run.
[3:32:27] <zhenthrim213> @A_German_spy hey sheilds are comfy
[3:32:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> People fall into the most interesting things when playing Dark Souls
[3:32:31] <%fat_burtreynolds> Mimic Channnn
[3:32:40] <%A_German_spy> @zhenthrim213 Oh, I'm not implying otherwise karacoLOL
[3:32:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> So much to keep track of/remember
[3:32:49] <youngking_kush> @a_german_spy He should really just use Grass Crest
[3:32:50] <Razeino> 10 scales is max
[3:32:51] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora These games really do build some odd habits, don't they.
[3:32:54] <Bromosap1ens> I still rememer how my first playthrough conditioned me to grip my shield button like my life depended on it
[3:33:05] <+Malysitos> Reggie could try to get the Silver Covetous Serpent Ring in TotG
[3:33:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Bromosap1ens I still do
[3:33:09] <%Ensign_Epic> god the monitor buzz
[3:33:12] <%A_German_spy> @youngking_kush It certainly wouldn't hurt.
[3:33:26] <+Jiggisnipe> @KeiganOfAstora regarding shield use, he did the same thing in Demon's Souls. Always dodged barely blocked, interesting
[3:33:27] <%linSP> Aramais vs ariamis
[3:33:28] <%fat_burtreynolds> Reggie gonna join the dragon cult for scale invasions??
[3:33:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, just use the Grass Crest Shield at this point
[3:33:40] <LunarRemix> Soul Spear pierces enemies so it's okay at AoE
[3:33:45] <Bromosap1ens> @KeiganOfAstora Dueling/Invading and Dark Souls 2/BB broke the habit for me
[3:33:46] <%AbnormalVoid> the big Fire AoE would be good if you got it
[3:33:47] <%vVAstrAVv> wheres firestorm
[3:33:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Firestorm is the best one, the giant flames
[3:33:49] <Razeino> The Soul Spear goes right through all the phalax
[3:33:51] <youngking_kush> Soul Spear pierces
[3:33:52] <+Shishi1205> Soul for pierce
[3:33:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> Soul Spear goes through multiple enemies
[3:33:57] <slackerunchained> Force miracle that causes the big body explosion is best, I think.
[3:33:59] <%MooseIsGoose> firestorm right
[3:34:03] <gryffinp> I'm here to kill Phalanx
[3:34:03] <%AbnormalVoid> Should go buy Firestorm
[3:34:08] <Bromosap1ens> Firestorm is great too
[3:34:11] <Bromosap1ens> yeah
[3:34:11] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus equip the evil eye ring
[3:34:13] <+Shishi1205> those are good souls too
[3:34:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> "Doesn't matter" LUL LUL LUL
[3:34:17] <%seydaq> not enough int to get the most out of soulmass
[3:34:21] <%vVAstrAVv> its crystal soul spear that peirces chat
[3:34:25] <lotharrio> If you upgrade symbol of avarice, does it boost soul drops?
[3:34:29] <slackerunchained> Fair enough, Woolie.
[3:34:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not that fast unless you have firestorm, this farming spot really is just annoying. It's not the best
[3:34:37] <Razeino> They both pierce
[3:34:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> How many souls does he need? For what?
[3:34:44] <Razeino> I just did a magic build
[3:34:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> For Twinkling?
[3:34:48] <velgaduere> Reggie overrespecting an old area
[3:35:02] <%Prevot> I always just farmed at the forest
[3:35:09] <+SuperThorio> I appreciate that Reggie isn't getting too cocky
[3:35:15] <+NobuuNobuu> just got here what are they farming for?
[3:35:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> I always hated how people say this is the best farm. Only if you have firestorm dude
[3:35:27] <Overloard> these guys are a disgrace to the idea of the roman phalanx
[3:35:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> This only works with Firestorm
[3:35:30] <stormhawk9891> Moonlight upgrades
[3:35:35] <gryffinp> build's fine, he just needs to have the correct tools
[3:35:35] <Bromosap1ens> yeah I just assumed he would use firestorm
[3:35:36] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Souls spear for pierce
[3:35:37] <+devonoel> go get firestorm
[3:35:39] <LunarRemix> Soul Spear pierces enemies
[3:35:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you basically NEED firestorm
[3:35:42] <+twohitgood> maybe forest hunters would be better?
[3:35:42] <%kimbucha> Wrath of the Gods or Firestorm is required
[3:35:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's working
[3:35:45] <zanzibarian_hamster> Firestorm?
[3:35:47] <%MooseIsGoose> try the soul spear
[3:35:49] <sendart> forest guardians might be better
[3:35:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:35:50] <mihokspawn> Crystal soulspear instead of soulmass
[3:35:51] <Qpic> doesn't catchpole 2h just oneshot them?
[3:35:51] <Razeino> All he has to do is roll attack and soul spear
[3:35:54] <yukichocomilk> no need to get another spell just to farm
[3:35:55] <%theoldone001> Quelana sells firestorm right?
[3:35:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Or just catchpole 2H R2
[3:36:03] <%seydaq> witch sorceries would be better now? spear or heavy
[3:36:05] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus He can use the Horizontal sweeps with MLGS
[3:36:08] <depressioncherrie> But Soul Spear has only 4 casts
[3:36:10] <%MooseIsGoose> wrong way
[3:36:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> what about Gravelord Sword?
[3:36:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Up the stairs
[3:36:20] <lotharrio> Well, either buy the right spell, or just do back and forth with the chaos fireballs and see what you get from four of them.
[3:36:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Throguh the door
[3:36:25] <gryffinp> forest hunter farming is probably faster and lower-investment
[3:36:26] <%vVAstrAVv> @seydaq spears stronger and casts faster
[3:36:31] <NumbF4ke> Forest might be better, since he is no longer part of them
[3:36:31] <+pandapeeps> why does it matter how fast they're KO'd?
[3:36:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Forest hunter farming is quicker
[3:36:38] <gryffinp> I assume the forest hunter farm trick still works in remaster
[3:36:39] <oda_flobunaga> Firestorm
[3:36:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> IS the best
[3:36:42] <Razeino> You still have to aim the spear behind there defenses but it does pierce.
[3:36:44] <Bromosap1ens> @pandapeeps efficiency. the goal is just souls
[3:36:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @pandapeeps efficiency, this is meant to be done tons of times
[3:36:46] <slackerunchained> @CanadianAnimatorGuy That works but it's a miracle, and Reggie doesn't have the Faith for it.
[3:36:46] <velgaduere> MLGS R2 would end up costing him souls in the long run
[3:36:53] <mihokspawn> Nito Knives
[3:36:58] <%Vigonept> gravelordsword dance is 0 requirements right?
[3:36:58] <MeImoth> Power within plus catching pole two handing
[3:36:58] <nxflre> @pandapeeps efficiency and for the streaam
[3:37:00] <%seydaq> @vVAstrAVv enbGood
[3:37:03] <%vVAstrAVv> @pandapeeps its the best farm if they die fast
[3:37:08] <Bromosap1ens> @velgaduere Not if he attunes repair weapon
[3:37:10] <youngking_kush> No, the 1Handed R1 with MLGS
[3:37:11] <sendart> forest guardians suicide cliff
[3:37:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Woolie, why don't you just hold the controller for him too LUL jk
[3:37:21] <velgaduere> @Bromosap1ens true, but the idea is also to save time
[3:37:23] <nxflre> graavelordd swod daancee should work
[3:37:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I waded in with havels and used firestorm
[3:37:37] <%AceNugget> sure hope there isn't a room with a boss healthbar out there woolieEVIL
[3:37:42] <+Shishi1205> those are still 400 souls
[3:37:42] <oda_flobunaga> Fastest is fists and unarmored
[3:37:43] <Overloard> unique abilities absolutely tank durability
[3:37:47] <+Shishi1205> nothing to scuff at
[3:37:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> right and then left
[3:37:52] <slackerunchained> Hacking souls with cheat engine is the *fastest*, technically... ;P
[3:37:53] <%seydaq> that poor hollow
[3:37:54] <%Deekman> Can you summon a buddy from chat in to just drop some soul items?
[3:37:58] <%Ensign_Epic> I mean... if they really want to cut out a grind, Mr Wraithmule can drop them a soul item or two or two stacks
[3:38:00] <OldOnyx> The two giants in Anor- Oh, right
[3:38:05] <Bromosap1ens> @velgaduere Well if a run can be only one cast it might work but yeah really we need to skill 5+ per cast or this isn't great
[3:38:07] <+Shishi1205> Line them up
[3:38:14] <Overloard> gotta line ite up
[3:38:20] <velgaduere> just gotta line em up
[3:38:34] <%Ensign_Epic> I would be more than happy to do so, but I think they want as natural a run as possible.
[3:38:36] <BurdRightsActivist> what is his build supposed to be?
[3:38:40] <%seydaq> @slackerunchained the forbiden cupboard spyPraise
[3:38:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> This would be much quicker with the Catchpole 2H R1
[3:38:42] <Owlboy7> still takes a a while without firestorm
[3:38:45] <Bromosap1ens> this is viable but needs a smidge of finesse. I like lining up piercing shorts tbh
[3:38:46] <velgaduere> soul spear was definitely faster
[3:38:47] <+Shishi1205> @BurdRightsActivist spellswordf
[3:38:58] <jett_eyes> they grinding?
[3:39:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> they grinding
[3:39:04] <OldOnyx> ye
[3:39:04] <Overloard> get the phalanx train up and chugging
[3:39:07] <radiorosewater> @BurdRightsActivist STRINT
[3:39:12] <Jaxnos> every kick reggie does gives an angel its wings
[3:39:18] <jett_eyes> nice
[3:39:19] <youngking_kush> Soul Spear is so good lol
[3:39:20] <%paladinstarbuster> it be a bit faster if he also just hit them as well
[3:39:29] <Equirah> there has to be a better spot for him
[3:39:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> personally I like farming in darkroot but this is fine as well
[3:39:35] <Bromosap1ens> spin 2 win might be cool yeah
[3:39:38] <%gatorafan> I was using this as background noise. Why did Reggie rebel against fashion again?
[3:39:43] <velgaduere> HAVEL'S BOIS
[3:39:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @gatorafan farming souls
[3:40:06] <Overloard> its about drive
[3:40:11] <+Shishi1205> are you rolling?
[3:40:11] <Overloard> its about powere
[3:40:11] <%gatorafan> I'll accept that
[3:40:13] <velgaduere> who needs to roll when you have KILL
[3:40:13] <%gatorafan> thanks
[3:40:18] <merrja> it's fine being big when you ain't rolling
[3:40:21] <%Deekman> life is still ticking down right now right?
[3:40:25] <Equirah> base forest is over double of this with ring
[3:40:25] <Capnrainbow> Shhh
[3:40:31] <+Ryukashin94> is he losing health while he sits?
[3:40:31] <+Shishi1205> your life
[3:40:31] <%Deekman> lol
[3:40:32] <xXxPS9xXx> Reject roll, return to kill
[3:40:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big boi now
[3:40:44] <%seydaq> spyCappa
[3:40:48] <brunoberserk> i normally farm with the giants in anor londo, because they also drops chunks
[3:40:49] <Razeino> This is just going to slow your run down
[3:41:00] <VincentGraves> is he grinding for cash?
[3:41:03] <+Shishi1205> Perfect
[3:41:05] <OldOnyx> This isn't optimal but just agreeing about what IS optimal could take hours
[3:41:33] <keohtv> The poison and Toxic mist spells are also great for farming them
[3:41:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just two-hand the catchpole holy shit
[3:41:40] <nxflre> could always consume a boss soul
[3:41:43] <gryffinp> well all that being said he IS halfway to 50k
[3:41:49] <%IronOhki> Grind Souls
[3:41:52] <+Shishi1205> too long
[3:41:53] <%DashXero> What are they farming?
[3:41:55] <%BignanasTheGawd> failed attempt
[3:41:55] <+vaderxyz1970> Time to CHEESE
[3:41:57] <radiorosewater> good episode
[3:41:57] <Razeino> Just roll attack kills them a lot faster
[3:41:58] <sendart> Suicide cliff time
[3:41:58] <LunarRemix> Just generic souls
[3:42:02] <youngking_kush> He got a cool 25k tho
[3:42:03] <+Shishi1205> Just better line up with the soul spear
[3:42:07] <Allen_33> tomb of giants has a lot of 1800 souls boners
[3:42:09] <Bromosap1ens> At this point he has the souls for firestorm. Why not go see Quelana?
[3:42:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> did get 20k out of it so ay
[3:42:11] <nxflre> @DashXero souls to upgrade MLGS
[3:42:13] <+LordCruxist> lol, I leave for 15 minutes and Reggie is pro farming with the mimic helmet. I love this playthrough.
[3:42:16] <%IronOhki> Honestly, it'd be fun to just go get the silver serpent ring.
[3:42:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> How many hero souls you got?
[3:42:20] <%MooseIsGoose> He is good he just has to line up his shots better
[3:42:22] <%DashXero> @nxflre Thanks.
[3:42:24] <%seydaq> 20k = 2 mlgs levels so progress
[3:42:25] <%linSP> Does Reggie have firestorm
[3:42:38] <Overloard> time to bbot up cheatenginedotexe Kappa
[3:42:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just use your catchpole, two-handed should one-shot them
[3:42:48] <Bromosap1ens> poison mist is a terrible idea
[3:42:48] <+Malysitos> Yeah, the forest hunters are really easy to farm. Best part is that Reggie can kill all of them instead of using the cliff method
[3:42:48] <+cdrom321> Why is he using Avarice?
[3:42:51] <lotharrio> Gravelord spell?
[3:42:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:42:59] <%MooseIsGoose> You can also try the spin two hand
[3:43:00] <+Shishi1205> its a miracle
[3:43:00] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> Woolie, why not just eat al those boss souls that won't be used?
[3:43:03] <Razeino> With this much Int I would just get rid of pyro.
[3:43:04] <deadseascrolldier> avarice is for lame soul farming
[3:43:09] <Overloard> give the goo bois another go
[3:43:09] <youngking_kush> @overloard No need for all that, I'm sure someone could just drop them some Souls before that
[3:43:12] <Equirah> @lotharrio miracle
[3:43:14] <%hax_metatron> If this wasn’t remastered, it would’ve been so easy, with the soul duping
[3:43:16] <lotharrio> Dang
[3:43:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> two-handed R2 strong attack will definitely one-shot them all
[3:43:18] <PunkZedB> gravelerd
[3:43:21] <+extradopeness> what we farmin for?
[3:43:26] <velgaduere> true, gravelord
[3:43:31] <+ElDragon_1> @cdrom321 because it gives more souls
[3:43:32] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:43:33] <+Shishi1205> lmaoooo
[3:43:37] <%MrKerb> Whats Reggie grinding for gain
[3:43:37] <Overloard> mist and spear?
[3:43:38] <%AceNugget> the pressure amnesia
[3:43:38] <keohtv> need toxic mist from Egg man
[3:43:40] <+devonoel> stinky boi
[3:43:46] <velgaduere> try Gravelord too
[3:43:50] <gryffinp> @keohtv shame this man
[3:43:52] <%paladinstarbuster> mgs
[3:43:53] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus I think just lining them up is great
[3:43:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Try using your catchpole, two-handed. Just once. Please
[3:44:01] <%IronOhki> I mean, might as well.
[3:44:03] <+Shishi1205> Just need to find the angles
[3:44:07] <%IronOhki> Midas Well?
[3:44:09] <deadseascrolldier> Forest is a way better location
[3:44:12] <velgaduere> he needs to line them up much better than he's doing
[3:44:17] <%hax_metatron> Chaos pyro on these dudes is the way to do
[3:44:19] <%scrubsintodreams> I wonder how good Crystal Soul Mass would be here.
[3:44:20] <VincentGraves> at least reggie is finally playing the  game
[3:44:21] <Razeino> Clams give a bunch of exp and twinkling.
[3:44:23] <%megaman_sentinel> just 2h
[3:44:25] <+Aldra_E> Not gonna take the loot?!
[3:44:25] <+Ryukashin94> if hes stays there and just uses it as a shooting gallery that could be faster since hes having an issue with lining them up
[3:44:27] <Overloard> shepherd of the goo
[3:44:27] <Bromosap1ens> if he sat at the low end of the steps like he did a second ago
[3:44:29] <+Shishi1205> @hax_metatron no pyrostorm
[3:44:30] <%Ensign_Epic> LMFAO WHO HAS THE DRAGON SIGN
[3:44:31] <%MooseIsGoose> Try the two hand
[3:44:32] <Bromosap1ens> The lineups are E Z
[3:44:32] <youngking_kush> You can buy a second Soul Spear at Firelink
[3:44:35] <velgaduere> I still vote Gravelord
[3:44:37] <cheapdoc> @scrubsintodreams He used it, it's not super great
[3:44:40] <radiorosewater> reggie at risk
[3:44:47] <Jaxnos> already at 32k here
[3:44:54] <Razeino> If your taking on phalax then just roll attack and soul spear. Chaos fireball sucks.
[3:45:00] <MeImoth> Reggie has to lock on to the one sfurther behind so that the spear flies further before hitting the ground
[3:45:07] <+Shishi1205> true roll attack
[3:45:11] <brunoberserk> also silver serpent ring + mimic combo is great for farming
[3:45:12] <+Shishi1205> two handed rollattack
[3:45:18] <nxflre> coulld alwways use a useless boss soul
[3:45:21] <%fat_burtreynolds> A whole game and not even one fire orb
[3:45:26] <+extradopeness> great fireball > great chaos fireball
[3:45:28] <velgaduere> Gravelord spell would probably help
[3:45:29] <%Ensign_Epic> @brunoberserk don't stack in this game
[3:45:32] <%scrubsintodreams> @cheapdoc It pretty much homed in one guy, didn't it?
[3:45:40] <cheapdoc> @scrubsintodreams yuuup
[3:45:43] <Overloard> really liking this pyro/sorc build tho
[3:45:46] <%MooseIsGoose> Start with soul arrrow and then fire ball
[3:45:49] <+Shishi1205> @brunoberserk Of course they stack
[3:46:01] <Equirah> @velgaduere it's a miracle, he'd be doing 12 damage
[3:46:11] <%Ensign_Epic> No, they stack in later games. Not the first game.
[3:46:12] <velgaduere> @Equirah I thought he did okay damage with it before
[3:46:12] <Aussie_Manny> like fish in a barrel
[3:46:15] <%MooseIsGoose> You have to get way closer now run back and sit
[3:46:23] <brunoberserk> @Shishi1205  yes , they stack, right ?
[3:46:24] <Bromosap1ens> god the cringe of watching hom shoot downhill and getting no multikills BibleThump
[3:46:38] <Equirah> @velgaduere he's never done it on enemies, just tried it on a safe zone
[3:46:43] <+Shishi1205> The effect of this ring stacks with the soul increase of Symbol of Avarice. It will increase to 144%. (120% * 1.20 = 144%) Also stacks with 20% soul increases from overkill, increasing the amount of souls to 172.8%. (144% *1.20 = 172.8%)
[3:46:52] <Razeino> Don't hit phalax while elevated with the soul spear. It aims the projectile towards the ground.
[3:46:53] <velgaduere> spin 2 win
[3:46:57] <keohtv> they're blind so the slumbering dragon ring works too
[3:46:59] <%Ensign_Epic> Ah, it's only CGS
[3:47:02] <Overloard> pog
[3:47:06] <velgaduere> LMAO
[3:47:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's the ideea
[3:47:13] <%MooseIsGoose> Two hand
[3:47:16] <%Ensign_Epic> Mimic hat doesn't stack with CGS in DS1
[3:47:16] <velgaduere> R2 right after they activate
[3:47:16] <dundore77> whats the point of the avarus helm in this? isn't he just soul grinding or is he tryng to get drops?
[3:47:17] <%gulthrax> farm theory
[3:47:19] <+Malysitos> Oh man
[3:47:23] <Overloard> meats back on the menu bois
[3:47:24] <Treasure_Vault> Two hand might prevent bouncing
[3:47:24] <cheapdoc> Or he could just grind patiently
[3:47:25] <%MooseIsGoose> Two hand will not bounce
[3:47:28] <%seydaq> Spartans! aroo
[3:47:30] <%MooseIsGoose> Or should not
[3:47:31] <Aussie_Manny> Farm Souls
[3:47:31] <deadseascrolldier> avarice increases souls dropped
[3:47:34] <keohtv> @dundore77 increases soul gain
[3:47:40] <%FreshSquozeBreastMilk> how many souls does he need total?
[3:47:40] <velgaduere> more time spent optimizing than farming LUL
[3:47:41] <+Jiggisnipe> tackled
[3:47:47] <Equirah> @dundore77 increases soul gain as well as item discovery
[3:47:51] <+Shishi1205> @velgaduere Hey if it works
[3:48:04] <velgaduere> @Shishi1205 defeats the purpose if the purpose is souls over time
[3:48:10] <Equirah> just do 2 r1
[3:48:11] <brunoberserk> POWER DUNK
[3:48:16] <cheapdoc> It's kindda working
[3:48:16] <Razeino> Roll attacks better
[3:48:18] <+extradopeness> do people really not know how the mimic head works in 2021
[3:48:23] <+ItalianWaifu> does he have the silver cov. ring?
[3:48:24] <%seydaq> this pole is rediculous
[3:48:28] <velgaduere> @Shishi1205 plenty of things "work", but if trying to be efficient is inefficient... then it's pointless
[3:48:37] <cheapdoc> YOU'RE GOING AT THE SAME RATE
[3:48:38] <+Jiggisnipe> @ItalianWaifu nope
[3:48:40] <%seydaq> i like it
[3:48:45] <+king_of_mystery2> go upgrade the sword right now
[3:48:48] <+Shishi1205> Depends on the overall time he is gonna put in
[3:48:49] <Bromosap1ens> @cheapdoc LUL
[3:48:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggarth has the biggest pole in all the land
[3:48:53] <oda_flobunaga> Still better than Nioh grinding
[3:48:53] <+king_of_mystery2> so reggie isnt afraid of his soul count
[3:48:55] <%IronOhki> Chat: Where do you grind for souls?
[3:49:00] <Equirah> stop using spear on single enemies and facetanking them NotLikeThis
[3:49:01] <%fat_burtreynolds> Grass crest shield bro

[3:49:42] <%IronOhki> @youngking_kush yuh, I saw earlier.

[3:49:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[3:49:59] <radiorosewater> ITS WORKING
[3:50:00] <%IronOhki> @Razeino Clams is good. Bonus twinkles.
[3:50:03] <+masarusasaki> wait sorcery is so good
[3:50:07] <+Pavi132> Why not use pyro spells?
[3:50:13] <%MooseIsGoose> also 2h
[3:50:15] <%Dopamien> what amount does he need?
[3:50:16] <velgaduere> @Pavi132 doesn't have firestorm
[3:50:18] <Overloard> clams with a side of twinkies LUL
[3:50:24] <+Shishi1205> The catchpole is stronger 2h not like the mlgs
[3:50:25] <%Ensign_Epic> Just gotta use your arrows to make 1 soul item become 999 soul items, ezpz
[3:50:30] <+Pavi132> Even great chaos would be useful here no?
[3:50:30] <cheapdoc> @Pavi132 Because apparently it was too slow
[3:50:35] <%seydaq> almost at 60k
[3:50:40] <Bromosap1ens> @Ensign_Epic Haha2020
[3:50:42] <Equirah> the time it taes you to do 1 r2 you can get 2 r1s out and hit multiple with the sweep
[3:50:44] <%Ensign_Epic> Quantity storage & menu manipulation baybee
[3:50:49] <+Shishi1205> @Pavi132 no decent pyro yet
[3:50:50] <nxflre> should be enough souls no?
[3:50:57] <%gulthrax> do not question woolies farming technique
[3:50:57] <taeko_ohnuki> what's reggie farming for?
[3:51:02] <Razeino> @IronOhki Yeah I know especially since Reggie wants twinkling.
[3:51:04] <%IronOhki> @taeko_ohnuki souls for upgrades.
[3:51:05] <%hax_metatron> Always pick up humanities
[3:51:11] <nxflre> @taeko_ohnuki souls to upgrade MLGS

[3:51:13] <+Shishi1205> You can farm for crystal soulspear at this point too
[3:51:15] <%livlinn> amazing chest head PridePog
[3:51:18] <%seydaq> @Pavi132 so long as it feels faster, like putting speedlines on tizok
[3:51:44] <%Ensign_Epic> And then keep a stack of 999 caestus in the inventory so you can drop negative quantities, so you can get every item by just not-buying a caestus
[3:51:47] <+king_of_mystery2> Don't forget woolie he can do all these upgrades at the bonfire
[3:51:48] <velgaduere> 2 hand
[3:52:04] <Bromosap1ens> please target enemies who are further back than the front row with soul spear
[3:52:04] <KellBeII> now its about pleasure
[3:52:15] <+Shishi1205> he is not killing them in one
[3:52:18] <Overloard> SMOrc we SMOrc are SMOrc farmers SMOrc
[3:52:18] <velgaduere> doesn't look like one to me
[3:52:18] <Jaxnos> he can only kill them in 1 when he two hands though
[3:52:23] <%tigerfang86> 2h r1 is the instant
[3:52:24] <Equirah> *he says as they live*
[3:52:26] <%Ensign_Epic> @Dopamien The beauty of Remastered: you don't have to, multi-use of everything but boss souls

[3:55:21] <keohtv> for backstabs and parries
[3:55:22] <lotharrio> Backstabs
[3:55:26] <MeImoth> backstab and riposte
[3:55:27] <LunarRemix> Critical is Repostes and Backstabs
[3:55:39] <%Fetrigon> ye
[3:55:39] <%AceNugget> and you can boost that with rings
[3:55:43] <+Pavi132> You will soon discover, it was at your side all along....
[3:55:43] <brunoberserk> '' what it does in trickster ? ''
[3:55:57] <+Shishi1205> upgraading means reseting durability
[3:55:57] <catasteroid0> upgrading also repairs
[3:55:58] <+king_of_mystery2> Upgrading fixes durability
[3:56:03] <Jaxnos> reinforcing repairs
[3:56:05] <%IronOhki> @brunoberserk More parry frames.
[3:56:06] <LunarRemix> It repairs back to full when upgrading
[3:56:07] <%seydaq> Wow trident
[3:56:09] <keohtv> resting at a bonfire repairs things
[3:56:09] <zanzibarian_hamster> Give it a swing at the phalanx
[3:56:14] <%Dopamien> @Ensign_Epic is this remastered version, I havent looked this up to try
[3:56:15] <%IronOhki> @brunoberserk That's not true I made that up.
[3:56:16] <+Pavi132> Don't worry guys, Gravelord's dead
[3:56:19] <cs0402196> gravelorded
[3:56:25] <%Fetrigon> LUL
[3:56:27] <+Shishi1205> rip velka
[3:56:39] <derap41> Clams are way faster
[3:56:40] <brunoberserk> maximum boar
[3:56:44] <OblivionSword1> you have 0 twinkling
[3:56:45] <+Pavi132> Velka's rapier does sooo much damage to black/silver knights
[3:56:49] <%seydaq> @Shishi1205 shes used to it
[3:56:49] <dundore77> for weapon they'll never use
[3:56:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> you have 0
[3:56:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:56:59] <+Krasmeyts> I was starting to get worried about all these gravelord disasters I've been hearing about, but it seems okay now.
[3:56:59] <+Malysitos> Wrong Woolie, he has zero twinkling
[3:57:07] <%theoldone001> Farm Clams in Seaths room for souls and Twinkling
[3:57:08] <xXxPS9xXx> 430 DAMAGE
[3:57:08] <%Ensign_Epic> @Dopamien yeah, this is a remastered glitch, not sure if its component glitches can work with PTDE
[3:57:09] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's good damage
[3:57:09] <%Qsmash_> insane damage
[3:57:14] <%MooseIsGoose> Go in and sing two hand
[3:57:14] <+Pavi132> He can just buy the twinkling also
[3:57:17] <brunoberserk> now do the inosuke's headbutt LUL
[3:57:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Disgusting
[3:57:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus two runs, he needs to buy twinkling titanite
[3:57:28] <+twohitgood> i thought two handing only applies to str?
[3:57:32] <+Shishi1205> Reggie tip for aiming piercing spells, lock on enemies further in
[3:57:36] <velgaduere> it would if they were still close
[3:57:36] <cheapdoc> It's pretty good
[3:57:39] <%Ensign_Epic> OOH BAYBEE
[3:57:39] <gryffinp> it doesn't pierce but it does explode
[3:57:39] <Overloard> not enough PIERCE
[3:57:39] <pepinillomaton> firestorm guys
[3:57:43] <%tigerfang86> Vine boom sound effect-ass
[3:57:46] <%MooseIsGoose> It explodes
[3:57:47] <+Shishi1205> no firestorm
[3:57:47] <Jaxnos> lock-on aiming is wonky cuz it inherently goes down
[3:57:48] <%Ensign_Epic> If he free-aims that shit it should!
[3:57:51] <%IronOhki> Fun though.
[3:57:52] <lotharrio> If he does it before they drop from the statue maybe
[3:57:53] <+masarusasaki> it looks like it pushes them back
[3:57:57] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus 2h MLGS is useless since it has no str scalling, just swing it
[3:58:05] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Yeah, explosive AoE, not a piercing attack.
[3:58:06] <ChoculaUltra> stepped away after Seeth, did I miss any boss kills/deaths?
[3:58:06] <Bromosap1ens> the sword swing would probably kill lots though
[3:58:06] <%paladinstarbuster> just hit them
[3:58:07] <+Pavi132> Just farm clams
[3:58:17] <%scrubsintodreams> DA CLAMS.
[3:58:21] <gryffinp> definitely more damage than the catchpole vs the phalanx. Faster swings too.
[3:58:24] <%scrubsintodreams> Plus you get purging stones.
[3:58:25] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus 2 handed swings would likely kill them in 1
[3:58:25] <%IronOhki> The bits! The bits!
[3:58:26] <catasteroid0> The MLGS doesn't have strength scaling, so it does the same onehanding vs two handing. The differences is only the orientation of the attacks
[3:58:30] <dundore77> wasn't the pole one shotting them?
[3:58:31] <%Lion_kun> OH IT IS SO GOOD
[3:58:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> clam slam
[3:58:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> even if the damage is only slightly better my fuck is it faster than the pole
[3:58:46] <lotharrio> @dundore77 Only when he two handed.
[3:59:03] <+Shishi1205> ?
[3:59:07] <Jaxnos> 1handed, the moonlight just did about 70 more damage
[3:59:09] <+Shishi1205> he needs to buy twinkling
[3:59:11] <Nitsuj293> LUL
[3:59:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't beef it
[3:59:23] <velgaduere> Reggie wants to replay the entire zone
[3:59:26] <LunarRemix> He can farm it real quick on Seathe's bonfire clams
[3:59:28] <Equirah> don't bone! you sat here
[3:59:28] <OblivionSword1> is warp not available here ?
[3:59:30] <+Pavi132> Reggie just wanted to do the zone again
[3:59:32] <+Pavi132> it is not
[3:59:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I was almost disappointed when I discovered that the catchpole is literally top tier and was beating out other things I was working toward
[3:59:36] <+Shishi1205> reggie is not lucky with the clams
[3:59:38] <TheButtravage> @OblivionSword1 Correct.
[3:59:44] <Overloard> serpentine
[3:59:46] <OblivionSword1> ohh ok
[3:59:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> especially for how much of a bitch it was to get seaths tail
[3:59:55] <FunkyWaters> Do they have any lord souls left?

[4:01:07] <+Shishi1205> @Pavi132 he was bodied by pris
[4:01:19] <FunkyWaters> Where's Priscilla, Reggie? Did she go somewhere? I hope shes okay
[4:01:22] <dundore77> fashion souls seems to be hurting reggie taking alot of damage
[4:01:32] <cheapdoc> @FunkyWaters Priscilla is a liar, she had it coming
[4:01:32] <%tigerfang86> Yeah but fashion
[4:01:34] <%tigerfang86> is fashion
[4:01:38] <+Shishi1205> if you bone back you go to a warpable bonefire but I respect not using bones
[4:01:46] <yukichocomilk> fashion is all that matters, you get good to overcome the stats
[4:01:46] <%scrubsintodreams> @FunkyWaters She's just invisible.
[4:01:50] <+Pavi132> Beauty is pain, fashion is suffering
[4:01:52] <%theoldone001> Considering he's been mid rolling all game he ain't doing bad
[4:02:00] <+Pavi132> Wait why's Anor Londo dark? What did you do Reggie?

[4:09:09] <+Pavi132> DLC should be right before final boss
[4:09:09] <PlumpPotatoRump> oh that explains why the DLC keeps beating my ass LMAO'
[4:09:11] <%superc37> wouldnt saving solaire mean nothing to reggie without context tho?

[4:09:17] <+extradopeness> bruh the dlc is too real
[4:09:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's insane
[4:09:22] <+king_of_mystery2> Woolie you did that in the LP
[4:09:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's good for farming humanity
[4:09:24] <+Malysitos> Reggie could theoretically use poison mist to kill that certain enemy behind the large door
[4:09:26] <su6human> normal humanity is easy to farm with all the gear Reggie has and there’re still hard humanity in untouched areas laying around
[4:09:27] <+vaderxyz1970> We going on a HOLY CRUSADE?
[4:09:27] <cheapdoc> Didn't you hit it immediately back in the day Woolie?
[4:09:28] <%AbnormalVoid> I do it as soon as I can, because it doesn't suck like most of end game LUL

[4:09:38] <%superc37> @theoldone001 oh they already fucked themselves out of that
[4:09:43] <%atlasdotwav> Final boss will warm you up for dlc Kappa
[4:09:46] <+extradopeness> yeah but woolie is nuts
[4:09:51] <primaryfire> @superc37 yea but they can just look it up
[4:09:52] <+Pavi132> I would get a non-elemental weapon for the DLC. The elemental/magic resistances on those bosses is real
[4:09:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @atlasdotwav you monster
[4:10:03] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Just, whatever you do, don't leave the covenant in-between giving her this humanity and opening the thing.

[4:10:53] <+Pavi132> You leave the covenant, you have to restart yeah. It sucks. I made that mistake.
[4:10:53] <cheapdoc> She succs it out of your body

[4:11:01] <+Shishi1205> It works on remastered
[4:11:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:11:08] <%hax_metatron> Woolie, remember that once you start gaining favor with a covenant, you’ll lose your progress with them if you leave the covenant afterwards. So be sure.

[4:11:40] <+quintonomo> I do the DLC as last as I can while still keeping Sif alive for that juicy cutscene
[4:11:43] <+cdrom321> This is just popping the humanity though.
[4:11:56] <%atlasdotwav> Goomanity

[4:13:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Also, the spell you'll get from offering this humanity will enable you to farm in the Painted World much more efficiently if that's necessary again.

[4:16:11] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus It's also a bit of a FromSoftwareism since all the games in the series have this obscure shit.
[4:16:12] <%A_German_spy> DON'T CAST IT IN HERE karacoLOL
[4:16:15] <%atlasdotwav> ‘Quelaag, why do you oink?’

[4:16:22] <Bromosap1ens> @Overloard Quelana came back eventually. Not known if it was while both were alive tho
[4:16:28] <%IronOhki> I legit have never heard those dialogues.
[4:16:28] <%notsoy> lmao @A_German_spy did you do that once?

[4:17:29] <%DreamCancel01> atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:17:36] <+Shishi1205> Its implied?
[4:17:40] <velgaduere> she's SUPER terminal
[4:17:42] <OblivionSword1> it's a very slight changes I think
[4:17:44] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus the legs are moving faster
[4:17:45] <%MooseIsGoose> Its the next level right
[4:17:49] <%Deekman> NotLikeThis
[4:17:50] <+JamesJaystar> Talk to her with the Witch's ring
[4:17:50] <%AbnormalVoid> her speech is WAY less stuttery now
[4:17:51] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus at 50 humanities its very noticeable
[4:17:51] <Razeino> The legs move faster
[4:17:51] <%theoldone001> The humanity helps a little, she dies regardless.
[4:17:52] <xXxPS9xXx> Time to chaos storm her LUL
[4:17:52] <jett_eyes> if anything I'd say it makes it worse
[4:17:53] <%atlasdotwav> monkaS
[4:17:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think you would have to give her more for that
[4:17:57] <KaiserMario> Isn't it just the legs become more lively?
[4:17:58] <jett_eyes> shes a firekeeper
[4:18:04] <Overloard> how bout that estus +

[4:18:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The only reason she's even alive is because she's a fire keeper
[4:18:13] <Allen_33> Just keep her barely alive with tons of humanity thatll be sustainable for sure
[4:18:15] <%superc37> @woolieversus yeah plague tested it in his lp and it turns out thats super bs, nothing about her changes depending on how much humanity you give her
[4:18:16] <pepinillomaton> Faster legs, that's it
[4:18:19] <youngking_kush> Reinforce Estus?
[4:18:28] <%Ensign_Epic> @A_German_spy All it takes is a single accidental button press, man. Killed Solaire one that way, with an accidental R2 from a Greatsword without a good backup XD
[4:18:34] <%AbnormalVoid> @WoolieVersus her speech is way more clear now
[4:18:34] <+Shishi1205> you peaked
[4:18:35] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Did Reggie ever meet Shiva of the East?
[4:18:35] <AncyentMarinere> Her legs be movin cus she fit now
[4:18:39] <lotharrio> Endlessly consume humanity to keep her alive. I mean there's plenty of humans, right?
[4:18:41] <depressioncherrie> Weren't they half way through the Tomb of the Giants anyway?
[4:18:43] <%theoldone001> GO SEE THE BOIS IN THE RUINS

[4:32:36] <gryffinp> i'm not convinced
[4:32:39] <a_mad_dragon_> lava is a government conspiracy, what kind of idiot would believe in liquid rock SoonerLater
[4:32:39] <LordOfThePoultry> yup
[4:32:42] <%atlasdotwav> Lava hurts durability*
[4:32:43] <%brandt_connors> does more poise damage
[4:32:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> weird
[4:32:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Gotta Two-BRAIN the sword
[4:32:47] <+Shishi1205> str scaling
[4:32:47] <%MooseIsGoose> Did not know that.
[4:32:47] <velgaduere> 2h only affects STR, not even dex
[4:32:50] <KaiserMario> Does more poise
[4:32:50] <%sagewuv> I come back and reggie went from strong to skrong
[4:32:57] <OldOnyx> Oh, right, Shiva sells the Demon Great Axe doesn't he?
[4:32:58] <%swesterly> Doubt
[4:32:59] <+Shishi1205> changes moveset
[4:33:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> really?
[4:33:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> Test it
[4:33:09] <Saikaboy> so 2 handing a dex weapon doesnt increase the damage either?
[4:33:10] <LunarRemix> With elemental weapons you can swing without even meeting the STR requirements and it still does normal damage
[4:33:17] <%swesterly> Fake news
[4:33:18] <%RyTYoung> We need to throw all this armour into the bottomless box like asap woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:33:21] <+Shishi1205> @Saikaboy if it has no str scaling
[4:33:22] <%A_German_spy> @Saikaboy Not unless that weapon also has strength scaling
[4:33:22] <@Solidus_113> 2H you staggered in 2 hits, check 1H
[4:33:22] <%linSP> If your hands were brains, then two handing it would add 1.5 int
[4:33:24] <velgaduere> this is one of the most well-known things in DS1, why is chat so doubtful LUL
[4:33:26] <+pectusumbra> has reggie does the special move with it yet?
[4:33:27] <Arqartur0> am I the only one that finds the sound effects of Dark Souls relaxing?
[4:33:29] <Bromosap1ens> @Saikaboy most dex have a little str too
[4:33:29] <%Jesterlly> his 1h swing did liek 300 his 2h did like 387
[4:33:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> It hurts because big brain
[4:33:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @pectusumbra ye
[4:33:38] <TheProtomanBlues> https://clips.twitch.tv/KindPoorOysterHassaanChop-AR4RPW2LZq6_yl1b
[4:33:39] <VJdarkworld> 2Hand only increases STR artificially. so it depends on the specific weapons scaling
[4:33:39] <KaiserMario> two 1-h swings don't stagger the taurus, two 2-h do
[4:33:40] <lotharrio> You gotta do the trig for it.
[4:33:41] <penitentpendant> Ace that math test, do most damage
[4:33:41] <+Shishi1205> @Jesterlly different enemies
[4:33:43] <oda_flobunaga> @Saikaboy it will, since most Dex weapons still have a little bit of Str scaling
[4:33:43] <%SarcFa> sometimes the 2 handed attacks just do a bit more damage in general, but compared to weapons with strength scaling the damage increase will be like 10 instead of 30-50
[4:33:45] <%Deekman> technically it's the same thing, umbasa
[4:33:45] <%Dopamien> you gotta 5head the sword
[4:33:51] <youngking_kush> Magic is Facts son
[4:33:52] <velgaduere> 2H only affects weapons with any STR scaling

[4:34:07] <FunkyWaters> See, the sword knows that you know the equations and it will dispense more damage as a reward

[4:35:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> So they still playing, just offline? How much longer?
[4:35:50] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario is because the amount of Poise damage you do is per-animation. So each individual attack animation on a weapon deals a different amount of Poise damage regardless of its damage or stat scaling.
[4:35:55] <Reveresao> go around to the left!
[4:35:56] <oak120> Fun Fact! The disconnect turns off Transient Curse! Ask me how I know.
[4:36:06] <LVL1_Scumbag> I understand everything now
[4:36:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @oak120 i am so sorry
[4:36:09] <+Shishi1205> @oak120 oof

[4:36:51] <NireFuster> TIGHT HITBOX
[4:36:52] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario So the two-handed R2s on a big heavy weapon will do, let's say for example, 63 Poise damage each, regardless of other factors, while the one-handed ones will do, let's say, 38.

[4:37:44] <PKSomething> I haven't played darksouls, but at a first glance, I'm going to guess everyone hates this area
[4:37:45] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario Exactly, yeah. So that's why even a weapon that doesn't benefit from the two-handed Strength bonus will still do extra Poise damage when held in both hands.

[4:42:44] <%A_German_spy> @LVL1_Scumbag Depends on the situation. Sometimes you're better off just running past everything, but not typically on a first playthrough when you don't know what's on the other side. So Reggie's slow-and-careful approach is fine here.

[4:44:23] <TheButtravage> He should have access to them.
[4:44:26] <%Ensign_Epic> Bloodstain appears on the last valid "stable" piece of terrain, which the lava is not considered
[4:44:27] <%Lion_kun> are the taurus one and done?
[4:44:29] <+Shishi1205> All taurus are bastards
[4:44:30] <KaiserMario> Oh yeah, that the MOST important item in the game too LUL
[4:44:38] <+lag2993> wait why dont the demons respawn if supposedly the bed of chaos keeps spewing them out
[4:44:38] <VJdarkworld> 🧐
[4:44:38] <penitentpendant> ...you just did

[4:45:12] <elshadow7> Is the bitrate super fked for anyone else? Or is it just me?
[4:45:15] <OldOnyx> I was about to say reggie had legit good instincts but......
[4:45:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> He kinda overthinking it
[4:45:22] <%Deekman> yeah it does seem that way
[4:45:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @elshadow7 it's the zone
[4:45:26] <%Dopamien> @elshadow7 yea its the area
[4:45:27] <KyberNasse> Head hurt
[4:45:27] <+Shishi1205> @elshadow7 its the area
[4:45:30] <yukichocomilk> just let him do it this way LUL
[4:45:30] <%A_German_spy> @elshadow7 It's probably just the zone. This area is notorious for it.
[4:45:31] <velgaduere> it's like 2 feet of lava
[4:45:32] <%Lion_kun> try a jump
[4:45:34] <BardockROCKS> Kappa
[4:45:34] <Aussie_Manny> You are the master of your own domain, Reggarth.
[4:45:34] <%Ensign_Epic> To be fair, that's a pain in the ass to properly jump onto
[4:45:35] <gryffinp> what does woolie THINK he's saying by saying "It's not a fall"
[4:45:40] <elshadow7> Ah, figures.
[4:45:44] <%atlasdotwav> I wouldn't have assumed you could climb it the way this game feels to play
[4:45:45] <FunkyWaters> Simply use magnesis to build a bridge out of boxes

[4:46:02] <PunkZedB> do it again, you might get it this time
[4:46:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> I hope Woolie remembers this item
[4:46:03] <%Ensign_Epic> Like I said, real pain in the ass to make that jump
[4:46:04] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie the Liar Made Me Die
[4:46:04] <+OutOfJambread> omg that look LUL
[4:46:05] <+Shishi1205> geometry bs
[4:46:07] <%Invlux> absolute edge of tilt
[4:46:07] <KaiserMario> But Woolie, that's the BEST item in the game tho...
[4:46:08] <chinelord> woolie was z targeted
[4:46:08] <Pie_Mastyr> woolie paying it forward from the lp
[4:46:09] <KaiserMario> LUL
[4:46:11] <+pectusumbra> just chill on it for a little bit
[4:46:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> This is how Lautrecs are born
[4:46:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[4:46:13] <mor3gan> this is why I don't play these games
[4:46:14] <+Xeogred> I always put a Flame Ring and Flash Sweat on here
[4:46:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @KeiganOfAstora woolie has to have someone to share his misery with
[4:46:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[4:46:24] <KyberNasse> Demon Ruins everybody
[4:46:27] <+extradopeness> no no we dont die! yes we multiply!
[4:46:33] <%HAttilaTheFun> maybe it's something that's much easier to do later
[4:46:42] <Mushinronja> why's woolie bein so weird about it
[4:46:55] <OldOnyx> rings make either approach much easier one of which is later on yes
[4:46:56] <%A_German_spy> @Mushinronja Because he doesn't want to spoil a certain mechanic for Reggie
[4:46:58] <NumbF4ke> Does the chaos ember have unique item text? @woolieversus
[4:46:59] <velgaduere> @Mushinronja because he jumped out of the back seat
[4:47:06] <yukichocomilk> @Mushinronja he really is
[4:47:14] <%jonblnt> @Mushinronja you could say that about anything
[4:47:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> MercyWing1 PJSalt MercyWing2
[4:47:44] <FunkyWaters> Chaos Emberald
[4:47:54] <@Solidus_113> jump gooder
[4:47:55] <daswampken> nah man ,he out of the back seat remember
[4:48:04] <cheapdoc> There is logic to your actions, except for you trying to walk on fucking lava
[4:48:05] <Mushinronja> i get the no spoiling, not asking for him to do so for sure
[4:48:11] <%Deekman> panicBasket
[4:48:11] <%atlasdotwav> I saw the demons and I assume they are guarding something
[4:48:11] <@Solidus_113> you don't have to wait
[4:48:13] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, you mean the chaos emeralds? I have one right here. lytONEMORE 💎
[4:48:16] <+Shishi1205> wait?
[4:48:18] <mor3gan> exactly, shits stupid
[4:48:18] <+Shishi1205> For what?
[4:48:22] <%Lion_kun> you can get it without waiting
[4:48:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> You try, fail, and learn
[4:48:25] <Parapattern> Indiana, let it go
[4:48:25] <brunoberserk> need time stop Kappa
[4:48:27] <%FreshSquozeBreastMilk> why do you have to wait
[4:48:30] <%atlasdotwav> You need time stop
[4:48:32] <%zanz_san> End game jank
[4:48:34] <%SarcFa> @Shishi1205 wait for ring
[4:48:36] <+plsnolookatme> the centipede is why woolie says to wait
[4:48:37] <+tnomads> i usually love the fire levels in souls games but this is a very rare D tier zone
[4:48:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> The game is designed to be confusing and weird
[4:48:40] <+Shishi1205> I mean sure
[4:48:42] <%Theycallmenerf> I forget what that item is.
[4:48:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Is it worth it chat?
[4:48:49] <velgaduere> @Shishi1205 Reggie feels that he's validated, because he hit geometry that stopped him
[4:48:49] <mor3gan> @ReallyBigRocks and thats not fun for me
[4:48:51] <+Shady_Zaku> @aussie_manny NO MR. OBAMA
[4:48:54] <%zanz_san> f tier zone
[4:48:55] <@Solidus_113> LUL reggie
[4:48:56] <+Rafraud> Game not finished
[4:48:59] <elshadow7> Just say "let's move on" Woolie
[4:49:01] <%seydaq> i blame the cristal cave geometry
[4:49:05] <+Shishi1205> @velgaduere yeah my comment was towards woolies comment
[4:49:05] <%megaman_sentinel> it's not worth it
[4:49:10] <+SuperThorio> If you don't remember what an item is then its usually not worth it
[4:49:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> @mor3gan that's perfectly understandable LUL
[4:49:12] <@Solidus_113> more the left side
[4:49:15] <+Shishi1205> super not worth
[4:49:16] <%Deekman> why are we being so esoteric?
[4:49:21] <+Shishi1205> left side yeah
[4:49:24] <%atlasdotwav> @theycallmenerf Ofc not but One Guy will be furious if they leave it ungrabbed
[4:49:25] <vivaciouseff> @Theycallmenerf i think it might be a soul item? it's seriously worthless is what i remember
[4:49:27] <Equirah> @Deekman spoilers
[4:49:35] <cheapdoc> This is ocd on the wheel right now
[4:49:38] <%HAttilaTheFun> isn't it just like a soul or something?
[4:49:39] <velgaduere> @Shishi1205 right, and my point is that Woolie wasn't sure how to refute it, because Reggie *seems* correct in his assessment
[4:49:46] <%Demoli_PT> please reggie just move on
[4:49:48] <velgaduere> even though he's not
[4:49:49] <%Deekman> yeah but saying "he can get on to from here"
[4:49:50] <%Demoli_PT> its fine
[4:49:50] <%Theycallmenerf> Screw one guy, Reggie has to become even stronger than he is now.
[4:49:59] <daswampken> rip
[4:50:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie gets hung up on the weirdest things
[4:50:05] <+Shishi1205> @velgaduere oh yeah not being able to say it outright makes it hard to explain
[4:50:16] <%HAttilaTheFun> oh thank god
[4:50:24] <velgaduere> @Shishi1205 yeah, exactly that too
[4:50:30] <+Shishi1205> You need some platforming master to know how to hit it
[4:50:34] <Overloard> Kappa Demon
[4:50:37] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora They're less weird if you look at them from the perspective of a first-time player doing a blind playthrough... a perspective which most of us in chat have long since lost.
[4:50:41] <velgaduere> ezpz
[4:50:43] <+Shishi1205> stagger bby
[4:50:56] <%SaintBeau> no kirk invasion :(
[4:51:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> @A_German_spy Which is why Elden Ring is gonna be so much fun!!!
[4:51:06] <%Theycallmenerf> Can’t wait for Reggie to The Zone eventually.
[4:51:13] <Aussie_Manny> Jebaited
[4:51:15] <ComfyFox> just say nothing
[4:51:23] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Haha, yeah, it'll be nice to get one more "first playthrough" of a Souls game.
[4:51:42] <Mushinronja> toss out the ol' "only one way to find out"
[4:51:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> "one more" and not "again"? Do you know something we don't?
[4:51:53] <Overloard> oh hell naw
[4:51:53] <%fat_burtreynolds> Only Motorboating
[4:51:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> As in, the "last one"?
[4:51:56] <%Qsmash_> so much fun incoming
[4:51:57] <%SaintBeau> demon ruins aren't THAT bad, Izalith is a trainwreck
[4:51:59] <+pectusumbra> the idea of it being open world also offers a lot of the original DS style freedom in routing as well.
[4:52:00] <+Shishi1205> Bro Souls have some fucking mechanich jank that is exclusive
[4:52:01] <KaiserMario> @A_German_spy ins't there a bug here that the glow of the Capra Demons eyes remains on the ground after  you kill them?
[4:52:04] <QueequegTheater> >one more Kappa
[4:52:06] <@Solidus_113> ctrl+c ctrl+v
[4:52:09] <+Shishi1205> I mean FPS based physics come onm
[4:52:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> solidus beat me to it
[4:52:16] <cheapdoc> A poorly placed, lazy party in a hallway
[4:52:19] <BardockROCKS> do, don't or die woolieEVIL
[4:52:19] <Reveresao> Be a coward like I was!!
[4:52:24] <FunkyWaters> Time for mousedropped Capras
[4:52:27] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Well, I say that because Elden Ring is technically a new franchise, and Miyazaki has gone on record as saying he's done making Souls games
[4:52:27] <%Prevot> this zone has a real "36 kars on mars" feel to it
[4:52:28] <%fat_burtreynolds> Seems awful pasty to me
[4:52:37] <%SaintBeau> i love how they're just hanging out
[4:52:37] <+Casavilla458> this game is very difficult to help someone without telling them what to do
[4:52:41] <+Shishi1205> worm
[4:52:41] <velgaduere> they fear the meth
[4:52:42] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 god wayyyy too many Japanese devs STILL do that shit, it's nuts
[4:52:44] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora So all I'm saying is that we don't know if we'll get another one after Elden Ring.
[4:52:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Okay Souls games, not "Souls" games LUL
[4:52:51] <Arqartur0> Co-War-Di-ce! Co-War-Di-ce! Co-War-Di-ce!

[4:52:55] <velgaduere> bodied
[4:53:01] <@Menitta> I only played Bloodborne and I know I missed a ton of stuff. I feel like Dark Souls is even more archaic with it's secrets judging by what Ive seen/know of osmosis
[4:53:01] <FunkyWaters> overkill
[4:53:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Does he see the bonfire?
[4:53:10] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario Could be. I don't recall it offhand if there is.
[4:53:11] <velgaduere> dope
[4:53:13] <+extradopeness> homing crystal soulmass makes my pp the big pp
[4:53:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Or does that bonfire not appear until you kill the worm?

[4:53:58] <Bromosap1ens> @Menitta Bloodborne's lore is arguably richer and deeper but Dark Souls is easily more weird and estoeric and janky in the way it shows and hides content.

[4:57:40] <+pectusumbra> already maxed? NICE
[4:57:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If I might proffer a suggestion, I believe you still have an open spell slot. Power Within would be a fantastic use of it. Might also be fun to test it with Soul Spear to see how much extra damage it gives you.

[5:06:17] <KaiserMario> @A_German_spy Hey Spy, isn't that door there at the bottom one of the possible in-world locales where you could reach the Kiln?
[5:06:31] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario You mean using a skip glitch?
[5:06:47] <KaiserMario> @A_German_spy I mean, in-game lorewise
[5:06:50] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario The "wrong warp" one, I suspect?
[5:06:52] <+Shishi1205> big Int boys
[5:06:56] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario Ohhhh
[5:07:05] <+Shishi1205> Your dmg is now Int
[5:07:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Int
[5:07:11] <PunkZedB> big brain time
[5:07:14] <+pectusumbra> 2 attunement gives you another spell slot as well
[5:07:16] <%Prevot> get more attunement
[5:07:18] <velgaduere> doesn't he get another spell slot at 16 attunement?
[5:07:20] <Awesome_Leaf> does dex effect cast time in this one?
[5:07:20] <lotharrio> Attunement for more spell slots. Got lots of stuff to do.
[5:07:21] <Parapattern> The big brain unga
[5:07:23] <QueequegTheater> I mean, at this point he's overlevelled for everything except DLC final boss
[5:07:25] <Overloard> big brain swings
[5:07:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:07:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 450 attack woolieGASM
[5:07:33] <ComfyFox> already 83 wow... woolie ended his run around 91 back then
[5:07:34] <KaiserMario> @A_German_spy Cause it's identical to the one in the Lordvessel room
[5:07:48] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario There are no explicit lore references to a connection, and I'm not aware of any meta references like interviews that mention it
[5:07:51] <%JetpackMcQuack> Unga Cabunga
[5:07:57] <gryffinp> Is it time to get some Repair Powder?
[5:08:03] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario Most likely it's just a case of game design limitations and reused assets
[5:08:05] <+Shishi1205> thats for the fap ring
[5:08:06] <cheapdoc> This game is tough but fair
[5:08:17] <%Indigo_Automaton> So many people would have never finished the game if that were the case
[5:08:18] <TheMadDemoknight> https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileCarelessAnacondaRickroll-sY6g8ujqpRol7cOf
[5:08:18] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario That's my best guess, at least
[5:08:20] <%Deekman> and somehow people say Breath of the Wild's weapon system is good
[5:08:20] <radiorosewater> I mean, you have a spell for this
[5:08:21] <glass_marcus> Crystal Moonlight Greatsword tho
[5:08:25] <%holydeviant1> Isn't "Turns to dust" what happens in Demons?
[5:08:26] <FunkyWaters> Ooooh Elden Pyroglove ... Shattered by someone or something
[5:08:33] <penitentpendant> @cheapdoc This game is tough and USUALLY fair
[5:08:36] <youngking_kush> Should repair the sword
[5:08:38] <+twohitgood> yep, may as well repair everything
[5:08:42] <+Shishi1205> nice
[5:08:44] <cheapdoc> @penitentpendant Like 90% of the time
[5:08:45] <elshadow7> Might wanna switch the iron ring for the bellowing (was it) dragon ring, for more glass cannon shennanigans
[5:08:46] <youngking_kush> It's down like 200 Durability
[5:08:55] <Mitchellsocks> Has Reggie looked at the side of the staircase?
[5:08:57] <%A_German_spy> Good man, Reggie, I like this thought process
[5:09:07] <KaiserMario> @A_German_spy I see, I thought it made some sense cause Izalith is similar in "heigth" to the Kiln, so it could be an alternate entrance or something, lorewise at least
[5:09:09] <QueequegTheater> Has Woolie played through the Scholar version of DS2? Thinking of the eventual Reggie VS Adaptability
[5:09:10] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah! It is about time to switch to bellowing dragon ring
[5:09:12] <%holydeviant1> Woah the remaster version of power within looks awesome
[5:09:13] <slipdog> and you never have to worry about your main being in the next game
[5:09:19] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Consider new rings for magic things
[5:09:26] <cheapdoc> Still could be honestly
[5:09:32] <ComfyFox> @WoolieVersus DS2 or Bloodborne next? :o
[5:09:33] <%FreshSquozeBreastMilk> chat, for someone thats never played souls games, whats the best one to start on
[5:09:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's still comparable
[5:09:40] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario It's certainly not IMPOSSIBLE. Firelink Altar does seem to be far enough underground to allow for it.
[5:09:42] <Mitchellsocks> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk this one
[5:09:44] <penitentpendant> Phys vs Mag resistance
[5:09:45] <QueequegTheater> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk Release order
[5:09:45] <Pie_Mastyr> @KaiserMario all I know is that door is used in that upcoming DS1 mod, nightfall. so there could be some sort of lore
[5:09:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk 1
[5:09:47] <gryffinp> Either dark souls or demon's souls remake, but probably dark souls
[5:09:48] <%Irridium> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk demon's or dark
[5:09:48] <velgaduere> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk this one
[5:09:49] <+FanServ> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk if you plan on playing them all, release order
[5:09:54] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario But there's no indication that it's explicitly the devs' intent.
[5:09:54] <Make_me_mad> Dark Souls 1 is honestly the best one.
[5:09:54] <%waltzqueen> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk release order
[5:09:55] <mothdude> B I G D A M A G E
[5:09:55] <%holydeviant1> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk 1
[5:09:58] <QueequegTheater> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk DS1, 2, BB, 3, Sekiro
[5:10:02] <KaiserMario> Cool
[5:10:05] <TheMadDemoknight> Dark Souls 1 for a good start
[5:10:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> plus the catchpole has polearm movelist which is top
[5:10:08] <brunoberserk> kaioooooooooooooken
[5:10:14] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah all this magic damage is without any of the sorcery rings
[5:10:15] <%A_German_spy> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk Yeah, generally I'd agree with release order.
[5:10:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @FreshSquozeBreastMilk release order but if you don't have a ps3 or ps5, then start with Dark Souls 1
[5:10:20] <su6human> @woolieversus fromsoft don’t put this one specific weapon in all their games for nothin’
[5:10:22] <cheapdoc> These enemies are not great
[5:10:22] <youngking_kush> Yeah the Magic ring works wonddrs5
[5:10:29] <youngking_kush> wonders*
[5:10:30] <%holydeviant1> To elaborate, Dark Souls 1 is the best starting point because it sets down the tropes and notes that 2 and 3 play on.
[5:10:32] <%AbnormalVoid> pure magic is really good against a significant portion of the game
[5:10:34] <%Prevot> whatever you do, don't start with DS2
[5:10:38] <QueequegTheater> This is the "We Ran Out of Money" area

[5:11:00] <Aussie_Manny> 🤮
[5:11:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus One other thing I'd like to point out is that because Power Within is letting you do enough damage to overkill enemies now, you're getting bonus Souls from them.
[5:11:01] <%Indigo_Automaton> Wait does the sorcery ring that increases power buff Power Within?
[5:11:01] <velgaduere> what the hell

[5:11:57] <+Shishi1205> good question
[5:11:57] <KaiserMario> Many reasons
[5:11:59] <@Solidus_113> nope
[5:11:59] <%Lion_kun> reggie, your sword literally has a ranged attack
[5:12:00] <%A_German_spy> @Equirah Sadly, yes.
[5:12:00] <radiorosewater> Jank.
[5:12:01] <elshadow7> Jank?
[5:12:02] <%zanz_san> jank
[5:12:02] <OldOnyx> never too strong to be cautious in this series
[5:12:04] <TheeRabbi> He didn't take the bait, but Reggie sure did
[5:12:04] <Parapattern> Maybe cuz he's upside down?
[5:12:05] <Make_me_mad> Woolie remains fucking BLIND.
[5:12:05] <%yendoria> dont worry about that
[5:12:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> the J word
[5:12:14] <%Lion_kun> feet not on the ground
[5:12:16] <velgaduere> very good
[5:12:17] <+Awkward_Cyborg> maybe because it's a special enemy
[5:12:19] <velgaduere> very strong
[5:12:19] <+Shishi1205> greatsword running attack
[5:12:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> speeen
[5:12:21] <%strakillias> Maybe cause he doenst touch the floor
[5:12:21] <+Rafraud> Game not finished
[5:12:21] <cheapdoc> Spin to win
[5:12:23] <oak120> Greatsword running attack is fantastic
[5:12:24] <KaiserMario> That's great for PVP
[5:12:24] <penitentpendant> It's 'spell center' is not where it should be for the upside down one
[5:12:25] <fantom_flasch> Thats a generic greatsword 1h running
[5:12:27] <youngking_kush> It's a glitch
[5:12:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Maybe it's considered an NPC?

[5:12:38] <+Awkward_Cyborg> oh fudge
[5:12:38] <%SaintBeau> do or die, reggie
[5:12:39] <Overloard> probably the homing poinnt was blocked by geometry/ armored side
[5:12:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now he's feeling it
[5:12:40] <+pectusumbra> and yeah, don't forget you have a sword beam
[5:12:42] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, there is a reason for that. It's because the geometry collision in this area obstructs the automated line-of-sight targeting of Soulmass spells even though there's no visual obstruction. It's yet more Fromsoft jank.
[5:12:44] <Aussie_Manny> ! WEAPON BUSTED AS FUCK !
[5:12:46] <KyberNasse> !PANICO!
[5:12:47] <OldManDeckardCain> "oh hi reggie"

[5:13:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> can still throw on the catchpole
[5:13:19] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Remember that Homing Soulmass has collision, so you could rub on them and still trigger it

[5:37:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Okay, I should clarify something about two-handing. It DOES still benefit you with the Moonlight Greatsword because even though you don't get the two-handed strength boost, there's an individual damage modifier on each attack animation, and the two-handed animations still have higher modifiers than the one-handed ones.

[5:38:28] <+Shishi1205> less magadjust
[5:38:28] <zhenthrim213> @KeiganOfAstora he saved an npc
[5:38:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh they did the shortcut thing. Cool
[5:38:34] <cheapdoc> YO, demon catalyst is kindda fire tho
[5:38:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @KeiganOfAstora cleared ruins, opened chaos door, got maggot
[5:38:48] <youngking_kush> Less Magadjust but it has an attack
[5:38:48] <oda_flobunaga> Reggie should Power Within on the next one
[5:38:51] <ChoculaUltra> wait that fatty was the first demon?
[5:38:53] <velgaduere> fire papa
[5:38:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> FIRST DEMON?
[5:39:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Thanks for the update guys
[5:39:11] <elshadow7> LUL
[5:39:12] <Awesome_Leaf> THE WHAT? 👀
[5:39:12] <Equirah> @ChoculaUltra shhhh we don't think about that and the retcons
[5:39:13] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus MagAdj is lower, but this catalyst does real damage as a weapon.
[5:39:13] <velgaduere> maga NOT just
[5:39:15] <gryffinp> I don't know that there's actually any build where the demon catalyst is better than another catalyst but, you know, lore
[5:39:16] <elshadow7> Make sorcery great again!!
[5:39:16] <%AbnormalVoid> Yuge Magic Damage
[5:39:17] <SoaringTrumpet> @ChoculaUltra  a bit underwhelming right?
[5:39:17] <+mechslayer71> KKonaW you know what you meant Reggie
[5:39:18] <%Prevot> nah that's just poorly translated, he's not the FIRST demon
[5:39:19] <ChoculaUltra> I had no idea, kinda feel bad for the guy
[5:39:21] <%robosqueeb> MAKE LORDRAN GREAT AGAIN
[5:39:24] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:39:24] <OldOnyx> the strength version of the tin catalyst I think
[5:39:24] <NireFuster> MAGAdjust LUL
[5:39:25] <%jonblnt> don't give them ideas
[5:39:26] <Jerp> motion values in this game are pre-defense, so it gives a bigger boost than you'd think, especially if you're on the lower end of the ar:def scale. in some cases, a 2hr2 may do 4-6x as much as a 1hr1 (low level broadsword against a couple of low/mid level bosses
[5:39:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> MAKE IZALITH GREAT AGAIN
[5:39:30] <+Shady_Zaku> @cheapdoc doodWat the puns really lol doodScrub
[5:39:30] <lotharrio> Who's great again?
[5:39:31] <velgaduere> "Make Izalith Great Again"
[5:39:34] <penitentpendant> Make Anor Great Again
[5:39:41] <+Shishi1205> its bc you can swing it
[5:39:43] <+pectusumbra> does it get better with upgrades?
[5:39:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maga Just
[5:39:47] <+extradopeness> MIGA
[5:39:52] <+Shishi1205> Upgrades?
[5:39:54] <+oz_suka> put it on!
[5:39:58] <TheMadDemoknight> Who knew a retextured boss was the "first demon"
[5:40:00] <+Shishi1205> Catalysts? in ds1?
[5:40:02] <%fat_burtreynolds> Tin banishment is fun
[5:40:15] <youngking_kush> You cant upgrade Catalyst in DS1
[5:40:16] <lotharrio> The original fire arts is an interesting idea.
[5:40:19] <KyberNasse> He was the original copy
[5:40:24] <%linSP> you gonna get chaos
[5:40:26] <ChoculaUltra> the original fake
[5:40:33] <radiorosewater> THE OG CTRL-V
[5:40:35] <%fat_burtreynolds> Upgrade the torch to +10
[5:40:36] <Major_Monotone> MAG adjust actually makes the sunlight maggot stronger
[5:40:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> The ctrl C
[5:40:47] <gryffinp> I mean, hit an enemy with a one hand and then a two hand, see what happens
[5:40:52] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It kind of is, yeah. I'll just DM you later. It's not crucial to understand it now.
[5:40:53] <OldOnyx> Tin is amazing with dex builds and a certain kind of sorcery
[5:41:00] <elshadow7> He's dealing like +100 dmg when 2handing
[5:41:02] <gryffinp> oh yeah there's a huge difference
[5:41:18] <gryffinp> 265 with one hand on the statues vs like 350ish with two hand
[5:41:20] <KyberNasse> First boss in Dark Souls is a reskin SoonerLater
[5:41:29] <mor3gan> laundry is done
[5:41:37] <FunkyStreams> when the magic so stronk you gotta two hand it...
[5:41:37] <Tumier> @mor3gan lol
[5:41:38] <StylishButcherPete> @mor3gan Nice
[5:41:41] <ChoculaUltra> they were just hanging out man
[5:41:42] <+pectusumbra> Okay, so basically you can use it as a sword and a catalyst at the same time. good if you want to compress
[5:41:42] <%kewlmyc> I know that jingle. Laundry is done
[5:41:47] <+Shishi1205> Reggie to go through aim for the one in the back
[5:41:50] <+Shishi1205> or free aim

[5:43:36] <%waltzqueen> KELLOG
[5:43:38] <%A_German_spy> @swesterly There are two separate factors which affect it. Strength scaling increases two-handed damage, but every weapon's two-handed moveset also gains a flat percentage damage modifier for each individual animation in its attack chain, and the modifiers on the two-handed animations are pretty much universally higher.
[5:43:38] <%AbnormalVoid> I love it

[5:44:02] <%A_German_spy> @swesterly So even a weapon that doesn't get the two-handed strength bonus still gets higher two-handed modifiers.

[5:49:03] <+Shady_Zaku> @seydaq doodScrub
[5:49:05] <lotharrio> Two levels will get you +1 slot right now.
[5:49:10] <%Prevot> just 2 more levels for the next one
[5:49:22] <lotharrio> Then it's like 4 for the one after.
[5:49:26] <%vVAstrAVv> its 2 levels 1 slot after level 10
[5:49:33] <THELAW3D4> Have we talked about that Matrix demo though.
[5:49:37] <%Prevot> you can also buy another Soul Spear and attune both to have 8 ammo
[5:49:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:49:38] <%AbnormalVoid> Dark Souls is so fucking deep
[5:49:40] <youngking_kush> You can get a 2nd Soul Spear for 8 cast of it
[5:49:48] <+pectusumbra> yeah, 2 attunement gives you another slot, then just put on a ring if you want another slot
[5:49:49] <ChoculaUltra> can we get a Path of Neo remaster
[5:49:51] <%fat_burtreynolds> It’s super fun
[5:49:51] <OldOnyx> 19 is 5 slots IIRC
[5:49:56] <elshadow7> 2nd soul spear + bellowing dragoncrest
[5:50:01] <velgaduere> 2 more levels of attunement would give him another
[5:50:03] <%AbnormalVoid> so many different things that change the way you play significantly
[5:50:14] <%vVAstrAVv> even on a sorcerer i just ride with 4 slots
[5:50:15] <%atlasdotwav> Ds3 attunment sucks
[5:50:30] <ComfyFox> imagine using your intelligence
[5:50:38] <OldOnyx> god slots a such a pita in DS3
[5:50:45] <%seydaq> high int for that happy chaos build
[5:50:46] <OldOnyx> *are such
[5:50:47] <Aussie_Manny> I dig the usefulness of the spells
[5:50:49] <%fat_burtreynolds> Think about waif…
[5:50:54] <Equirah> so glad ER finally fixed attunement, although it'll be a bigger problem for twink invaders
[5:50:56] <lotharrio> I think in DS2, which was the one I was big into spells, I maxed out at 6 slots.
[5:51:05] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, it may be a grind, but I would invest the time in finishing Logan's quest, the spell you get is the strongest in the base game.
[5:51:08] <%jonblnt> @WoolieVersus I managed to buy a PS5 yesterday! Eldin Ring here I come! Shout out to Wario64 and black baby Jesus. Reggie you're inspiring! LET'S GO
[5:51:13] <elshadow7> hexer build in ds2 is really fun
[5:51:19] <Aussie_Manny> Maybe in Ooohhh Elden Ring, spells will be more intuitive.

[5:52:47] <+king_of_mystery2> Not a seath stan but its hilarious they are throwing shade at him while simultaneously using a sword from his tail and using the art that he is the grandfather of.

[5:57:36] <%andrewofbob> CT seemed so simple, CF looks so loaded with systems
[5:57:43] <%jinking79> go rewatch your video then doodLUL
[5:57:44] <@Menitta> Does DNF actually have rollback
[5:57:59] <%Ensign_Epic> I mean, if you know GG then Blazblue isn't all THAT different. Except for the parts that are XD
[5:58:02] <GoldenGod0> We no nothing about that game
[5:58:14] <@Solidus_113> could be like strive where the first beta won't have rollback
[5:58:22] <@Menitta> All that exists is a statement from Summer saying they want to have rollback in future games.
[5:58:22] <Aussie_Manny> DNF should have rollback, but they haven’t hard confirmed it.
[5:58:23] <%townzzzzz> arc and 8ing, the strongest team up
[5:58:27] <%kewlmyc> Isn't it more 8ing
[5:58:32] <OblivionSword1> and 8ting

[5:58:41] <@Solidus_113> yeah it's 8ing
[5:58:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though, I feel like dnf works on the XRD engine which hasn't provided a single rollback game yet, but here's hoping
[5:58:50] <OblivionSword1> 8ting responsible mvc3 I think ?
[5:58:51] <FunkyStreams> dunno if im down
