[0:00:04] <%dds333a> here we go
[0:00:11] <fuji_n2> man striker seems to have a hard time getting close to crusader
[0:00:12] <%Shad0wTag> kunoichi does less dmg overall right?
[0:00:13] <@Menitta> yeyeye
[0:00:31] <+SaurianCrash> in a room yah
[0:00:32] <%Shad0wTag> less get it on fellas
[0:00:48] <randomdude365> What’s up
[0:00:51] <fuji_n2> like every crusader I fought just crushed me
[0:00:55] <%leith_aziz> Hi
[0:01:01] <@Menitta> Crusader is terrifying
[0:01:06] <xXVeggiePLusXx> I'm ready
[0:01:08] <%leith_aziz> Hi Woolie
[0:01:11] <%livlinn> joofbLurk right on time
[0:01:20] <Triplicat> damn woolie slapped BBCF with the for fun huh
[0:01:24] <fuji_n2> dude can just push you to the other side of the screen with a button
[0:01:25] <Triplicat> that's how it be
[0:01:26] <FacetiousAF> sounds good
[0:01:28] <@Menitta> Understandable
[0:01:29] <%gingersnap_> gingersnap_ subscribed with Prime. 
[0:01:31] <KyberNasse> I fought a Striker player as Inquis, they left after they lost and stood in the lobby even tho I was the only one with free space LUL
[0:01:47] <+Mrbaconator> WHEEL OF CHEESE
[0:01:47] <%dds333a> he's got experience Kappa
[0:01:48] <KyberNasse> It was like the Marge pretending not to look meme
[0:01:49] <@Solidus_113> I like inquisitor
[0:01:49] <fuji_n2> @kybernasse LUL
[0:01:55] <+toastybites> LUL
[0:01:55] <fuji_n2> yeah
[0:01:58] <@Menitta> Its bad
[0:02:05] <@Menitta> the beta is very nonfunctional
[0:02:08] <fuji_n2> fucking no training mode is horrible
[0:02:15] <Sonicdy> “ Demo”
[0:02:21] <iacus_> mobile gaming strategy
[0:02:26] <Lunalios> *Beta, not demo, as Max put it
[0:02:27] <@Menitta> Lack of a training mode is a two pronged effect because now, all there is is player match
[0:02:27] <+RobeBLB> CPU matches are fine but you can't even pick your character in them
[0:02:28] <TacoBomber> that's because it's not a demo it's a beta/stress test
[0:02:31] <@Menitta> and that floods it
[0:02:32] <%leith_aziz> Anything different than usual day 1 server shenanigans
[0:02:35] <OldManDeckardCain> nexon
[0:02:38] <%Shad0wTag> beta is a key word
[0:02:39] <+weaster4> played this mmo growing up and now its an arcsys/6ing fighting game, life is strange
[0:02:42] <fuji_n2> nipple
[0:02:43] <@Solidus_113> neeople and 8ting
[0:02:51] <+McSoliace> very similar to the dbfz beta
[0:02:55] <Arqartur0> meeple?
[0:02:56] <@Menitta> Its different because nobody has any idea what they're doing and has no ability to learn
[0:02:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:03:14] <@Solidus_113> when the servers are down you have CPU matches
[0:03:17] <TacoBomber> IIRC the gbvs beta was pretty rough connection-wise too
[0:03:41] <TanyaSaberFace> game sounds kinda chunky to me
[0:03:46] <+McSoliace> connections are fine
[0:03:49] <%leith_aziz> @TanyaSaberFace I think taht's teh stream
[0:03:52] <@Menitta> the in game connections are good
[0:03:54] <+Jrocy247> Why does it sound like it's coming out of a Speaker?
[0:03:57] <%Shad0wTag> @Solidus_113 its worse when even that isn't available
[0:03:58] <+McSoliace> its the functionality
[0:04:07] <@Menitta> oh yeah sometimes you just cant move in your own rooms
[0:04:09] <TanyaSaberFace> but woolie sounds fine to me
[0:04:19] <enddword> BatChest HOLY HECK
[0:04:20] <+weaster4> the first lobby i went in was screwed up like that, i had to make my own
[0:04:21] <+SaurianCrash> see if you can make a room i join some others
[0:04:29] <KyberNasse> What I dont get is that on CPU matches your character is random
[0:04:31] <BackflipCharm> I'm pretty sure you can move once someone enters you rroom
[0:04:35] <KyberNasse> Lemme lab
[0:04:38] <%JustToWatch> they did fix some of the issue from Yesterday, I can actually search for a room now
[0:04:40] <KyberNasse> SMOrc
[0:04:42] <OldManDeckardCain> game is a bit too loud compared to woolie
[0:04:44] <@Menitta> And when you fight the CPU you CANT CHOOSE A CHARACTER
[0:04:46] <%Shad0wTag> Considering we have the full roster I think this game is closer to release but I only hope we have alot more features that should be here
[0:04:47] <+McSoliace> dbfz did that
[0:04:51] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[0:04:57] <kentrix11> It sucks.
[0:04:59] <%paladinstarbuster> luckily the CPU is pretty good
[0:05:02] <%leith_aziz> I feel really tired today for some reason. Had a hard time sleeping. I feel like it had to do with the video SCB put out last night
[0:05:10] <Lunalios> It's very weird that the CPU matches are random selects???
[0:05:14] <enddword> dkd they extend the beta?
[0:05:16] <+Hasu_EXE> I'm so pissed there's no training mode
[0:05:18] <OldManDeckardCain> the cpu was better than most of my opponents LUL
[0:05:18] <Daxalog> Nope!
[0:05:20] <%Shad0wTag> Like if we had like 4 characters and it was like this it would make me think it was further away
[0:05:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EWWW
[0:05:23] <23rald> yea its weird
[0:05:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> EVOLVE OR DIE
[0:05:26] <@Solidus_113> there's a command list for every character here https://dfoarchive.blogspot.com/2021/12/dnf-duel-manual-command-lists.html
[0:05:28] <+mgod19> no game for you
[0:05:29] <Triplicat> the AI matches random selecting your character for you makes me laugh super hard
[0:05:31] <+cgkonnor> Learn through Deaths
[0:05:33] <%paladinstarbuster> EVOLVE OR DIE
[0:05:34] <%Shad0wTag> But its the whole roster and there is this much missing for a beta???
[0:05:36] <kentrix11> The CPU tricked me for a bit because it did some dumb stuff I thought only people would do.
[0:05:38] <%livlinn> spyShock
[0:05:46] <fuji_n2> YOU GON LEARN IN THE FIELD BOI
[0:05:50] <primaryfire> hard to test the netcode if you don't know how the game's supposed to feel
[0:05:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BLITZ NETCODE, WHAT ABOUT BLITZ MARKETING
[0:05:55] <@Menitta> I didnt know there was a roll until this morning
[0:05:56] <Sonicdy> “Demo”
[0:05:57] <Ardisan_> LEARN
[0:06:00] <@Menitta> BLITZ MARKETING LUL
[0:06:02] <kentrix11> You can check the buttons in the settings section of the online menu, just press trinagle.
[0:06:03] <+McSoliace> they put a bunch of info out the day of the beta
[0:06:05] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @randomdude365
[0:06:06] <%dds333a> Trial by fire LUL
[0:06:08] <jashugan_1> I heard max say training is a luxry in these betas and that its just to test online functionality
[0:06:09] <Fiendmaw> They wanted that `91 SF2 vibe
[0:06:13] <+Hasu_EXE> I did throw my face at it and I did have a good time tho
[0:06:13] <+Lord0Mugen> Game is pretty good
[0:06:24] <%mr_sups> mr_sups subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Sups Woolie and Reggie. Hope y'all have happy holidays
[0:06:24] <%Shad0wTag> you must check out our 30 second video telling you how to play
[0:06:24] <Arqartur0> But Hard Games are good!
[0:06:25] <OldManDeckardCain> the arcade experience LUL
[0:06:25] <fuji_n2> let's hope the next beta is better
[0:06:28] <Sonicdy> BLITZ MARKETING IS REAL
[0:06:29] <Ardisan_> PLAY AND LEARN OR DIE
[0:06:29] <%Shad0wTag> heaven forbid
[0:06:36] <%leith_aziz> Chat on DEB's stream think that the online mode is all you need during the beta. But I admit, no training mode is a missed opprtunity
[0:06:43] <%Shad0wTag> THE TRUE ARCADE EXPERIENCE
[0:06:45] <+Mrbaconator> WHEEL. WHEEL. WHEEL
[0:06:45] <Arqartur0> But Dark Souls told me Hard games are good!
[0:06:48] <%leith_aziz> So it's interesting seeing Woolie's view on this
[0:06:51] <Lunalios> I understand the online functionality matter more than us labbing the characters, but learning the basics of the game would be nice
[0:06:59] <KyberNasse> WHEELER DEALERS
[0:07:01] <+Hasu_EXE> Wheel is hella fun!
[0:07:02] <+Jiggisnipe> Keits vouched for developers saying that it is not uncommon to have only online to test the network
[0:07:04] <sferrzz> grappler is an ssr drop
[0:07:06] <Mr_Rakjo> Grappler is SSR Rank you have to be lucky to get it LUL
[0:07:07] <+Lord0Mugen> @leith_aziz i just got in, whats his view?
[0:07:08] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag that's nothing LUL LUL
[0:07:11] <Lunalios> it's not like an fps where most functions are kinda universal
[0:07:11] <+Mrbaconator> gavlan WHEEL gavlan DEAL
[0:07:17] <%paladinstarbuster> when had a betting game in max's chat last night because he couldn't get grapple and then he got him twice and not again LUL
[0:07:22] <Ardisan_> This makes me want to play DFO everytime I think of DNFD
[0:07:24] <TanyaSaberFace> NFT artificial scarcity
[0:07:25] <+TestAnon> gacha fighting game LUL
[0:07:26] <+Mrbaconator> ALL WHEEL DRIVE
[0:07:27] <+DreyfussFrost> Sounds like they're so focused on getting data that they're giving no thought to the data they're putting out.
[0:07:28] <Triplicat> if you walk over the pond and play KoFXV's beta they have all this btw
[0:07:32] <Triplicat> which makes it kinda hurt
[0:07:38] <+McSoliace> its technically not a demo but a beta so the point is so they fix these online issues not for learning but yeah its not great
[0:07:39] <%Shad0wTag> They coulda included the video breakdowns as fast as they in game since there is no info in game
[0:07:40] <fuji_n2> still gotta try inquisitor
[0:07:41] <%leith_aziz> @Lord0Mugen Beta started out nonfunctional in the beta. Also beta doesn't have offline at all
[0:07:42] <Triplicat> I'm far more interested in playing DNFD than KoFXV
[0:07:47] <%Vigonept> no learn the entire roster
[0:07:48] <Ardisan_> Same
[0:07:54] <@Solidus_113> game is fun, I still don't like block buttons in fighters
[0:07:57] <Triplicat> but literally the direct comparison between the two betas both running this same weekend lol
[0:08:04] <@Menitta> but the realistic thing is funneling every single person into a free beta online is not going to be representative of the release because there will be offline and training and such
[0:08:07] <%Shad0wTag> @Solidus_113 especially 2D fighters
[0:08:10] <+slayabee> Block button is optional @solidus_113
[0:08:13] <+Lord0Mugen> @leith_aziz i mean it DOES technically. although the beta is about the online, not really the characters
[0:08:18] <Andu_in> no airblock and my up/back holding ass is getting tagged all the time
[0:08:20] <%leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 Let's just say that the block button in MK is far from my problem with those games
[0:08:23] <fuji_n2> I don't mind the block button since we can just hold back to block still
[0:08:23] <Alt_Tab_streams> You should just get a coin slot at this point
[0:08:25] <%thatdamnspacecowboy> Game is fun, but why no practice mode?
[0:08:28] <%dds333a> @dreyfussfrost not even that LUL
[0:08:29] <@Menitta> also the PS5 version doesnt support PS4 arcade sticks.
[0:08:31] <TigerClaws12> you can if you have 2 systems and a bit of faith
[0:08:32] <+BackwardCap> Just hook up 2 PS5s OWLSombra
[0:08:34] <@Menitta> that was a cherry on top for me
[0:08:40] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta oh absolutely but considering the full roster I worry the release date is closer than we think
[0:08:45] <%paladinstarbuster> learning on the fly was fun
[0:08:46] <%Giothegame> Time to walk up to the arcade and learn as you play
[0:08:47] <+rasend0ri> How you gonna blackmail a black male!?!?!
[0:08:48] <+Lord0Mugen> And the online ive seen is pretty solid
[0:08:55] <%leith_aziz> You can focus on the betas for today
[0:09:02] <KyberNasse> Oh, theres no air blocking? No wonder I got slapped around LUL
[0:09:20] <%paladinstarbuster> @rasend0ri no don't LUL
[0:09:30] <fuji_n2> everyone has been ONE GUY at least once
[0:09:35] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> <3
[0:09:36] <%Shad0wTag> @KyberNasse nah but automatic techroll from air knockdowns
[0:09:44] <Arqartur0> BTW, I just got my brother into Yakuza Like a Dragon, not knowing anything about the Yakuza games, and he is a big GTA/Mobster movie fan, so I don't know what will happen
[0:09:45] <@Solidus_113> no air blocking, and only dragon knight has an air dash
[0:09:46] <+TestAnon> I hear the conversion mechanic is similar to TvC
[0:09:47] <%MajorCrasher> MajorCrasher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:09:49] <@Solidus_113> it's weird
[0:09:56] <%leith_aziz> I feel like SCB's video last night made me feel like shit because I was the odd man out, IE morel ike Woolie and less like Pat
[0:10:00] <%Shad0wTag> @TestAnon yeah
[0:10:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[0:10:01] <@Menitta> Tip for creating a room. Set the mode to 2P Stays on as thats an uncommon rotation rule used. It can narrow down people searching
[0:10:04] <+JaseAdrift> it's so bizarre
[0:10:07] <odd_slater> The music fucks at least lol
[0:10:07] <Andu_in> most of the cast has BIG buttons
[0:10:11] <Fiendmaw> I am digging the angle of this sword
[0:10:13] <+rasend0ri> God I want HnK to be a thing again!
[0:10:19] <Arqartur0> @JaseAdrift maybe it'll be adventure.
[0:10:20] <Lunalios> no air block...huh...
[0:10:21] <JoviLovesYou> @WoolieVersus I watched Spooky get an error mid match. He just ignored it and didn't press confirm and it went away in the next round. Its fucking bizarre.
[0:10:24] <odd_slater> The buttons are big and they feel good lol
[0:10:26] <%leith_aziz> Maybe that's why I had trouble sleeping and been feeling like shit
[0:10:32] <fuji_n2> korega requiem da
[0:10:33] <+Mrbaconator> there she is
[0:10:33] <@Menitta> also sometimes, the player match menu will be invisible

[0:10:52] <Lunalios> I feel like Reggie's gonna pick striker or inquisitor, what do ya'll think?
[0:10:55] <Andu_in> Spooky tweeted about how you can play the beta
[0:11:03] <Fiendmaw> Entered a room you can't play in...

[0:13:59] <%leith_aziz> Yeah, this man's been grinding
[0:14:00] <fuji_n2> I created a room early and it was dine today woolie
[0:14:06] <+Lord0Mugen> this is some horseshit
[0:14:07] <fuji_n2> try at least
[0:14:13] <Puhff> yeah he looks like he is Keepo
[0:14:13] <haitakaa> gouki
[0:14:16] <jashugan_1> ive been playing grappler and this guy is kind od
[0:14:16] <Arqartur0> I will say, the game looks great
[0:14:21] <Triplicat> crusader 214MS->j.214MS is the sickest
[0:14:21] <+0neReeler> crusader is a zoner
[0:14:28] <fuji_n2> ^
[0:14:36] <@Solidus_113> supers work like MK11 fatal blows too
[0:14:36] <+Lord0Mugen> why?
[0:14:39] <%dds333a> whoa
[0:14:45] <Triplicat> grappler anti-air grab is also sick
[0:14:48] <TigerClaws12> dude's put in work
[0:14:49] <%Giothegame> Some character got debuffs they can put on opponents too
[0:14:51] <+Lord0Mugen> you lose your enhancments if you ascend
[0:14:53] <primaryfire> I've seen the round call like 15 times and still don't know what it means
[0:15:00] <Triplicat> you can't walk around until someone joins
[0:15:01] <OldManDeckardCain> you totally can tho
[0:15:02] <+BackwardCap> They fixes that
[0:15:05] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus That was an early bug. It seems to be fixed now.
[0:15:06] <Ardisan_> I want to play but I really dont want to setup my Playstation again
[0:15:07] <Civet10> they fixed that i think
[0:15:08] <OldManDeckardCain> yeah they fixed that
[0:15:10] <%JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus they fixed that
[0:15:12] <TigerClaws12> @WoolieVersus it's fixed
[0:15:13] <odd_slater> You can now Woolie lol
[0:15:14] <@Menitta> Im walking in my room now lol
[0:15:14] <+Akizea> that's fixed
[0:15:16] <jashugan_1> yeah thats fixed im pretty sure now
[0:15:21] <%leith_aziz> @Ardisan_ Im kinda the same lol. PC player
[0:15:25] <fuji_n2> I don't wanna be that guy, but when I made a room it was fine, so at least try it again woolie
[0:15:25] <+zenus_epsilon> try again. they did some fixes over night
[0:15:27] <+0neReeler> 45%
[0:15:28] <%mr_sups> This Beta is so Jank, which sucks becuase a lot of people are going to have a bad taste in there mouth from this game.
[0:15:28] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta youre special. thats why
[0:15:32] <fuji_n2> I think they fixed it
[0:15:35] <+0neReeler> NOPE
[0:15:36] <@Menitta> Daw
[0:15:41] <Ardisan_> @leith_aziz Yeah im pc as well
[0:15:44] <primaryfire> maybe dodging helps escape the corner?
[0:15:47] <+Lord0Mugen> WTF?!
[0:15:48] <+Akizea> you have to combo into super or get them super off guard
[0:15:53] <KyberNasse> Well it is beta test, not a demo
[0:15:55] <@Menitta> That wall is some Aganos shit
[0:15:55] <quietshun> @mrbaconator It's a beta tho, people should expect jank
[0:15:57] <%leith_aziz> @mr_sups People are used to this, dont worry. Day 1 servers for most games never leave the best impressions.
[0:15:58] <@Menitta> its terrifying
[0:16:03] <quietshun> oh woops
[0:16:06] <fuji_n2> I'd be playing all day if this beta was more polished
[0:16:11] <+Mrbaconator> @quietshun wrong guy
[0:16:16] <quietshun> Yeeee lol
[0:16:22] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta too bad Grappler doesnt give a shit
[0:16:26] <Triplicat> SHOULDER TACKLERU
[0:16:28] <Guigondi> I do NOT BLAME people for skipping outros, the countless disconects made the players to impatient and they wanna play as much they can before the next disconect.
[0:16:28] <%leith_aziz> @mr_sups By that attitude, im really happy people gave Strive a shot considering its first betas
[0:16:29] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta I think I found you
[0:16:33] <Fiendmaw> How fast are grabs in this game?
[0:16:35] <odd_slater> People are so used to game beta's not being actual beta's so everything is taken at face value these days lol
[0:16:54] <+0neReeler> light light, no armor
[0:16:55] <BackflipCharm> Crusader is anime aganos
[0:17:02] <+Lord0Mugen> @odd_slater do you blame them? most of them arent.
[0:17:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:17:06] <%Qsmash_> yeah most people see betas as demos
[0:17:07] <@Solidus_113> Crusader has a really strong burst special
[0:17:17] <+Sondiame> A dedicated block button for this type of game feels weird
[0:17:18] <fuji_n2> anime Jesus is scary to fight
[0:17:20] <Ardisan_> I think I saw combos with hsi Aegis Reflector looking move
[0:17:22] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta I'm trying to join your room but it I get an error message
[0:17:23] <Ardisan_> looked sick
[0:17:24] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:17:29] <@Menitta> ah damn
[0:17:31] <%leith_aziz> Yoink
[0:17:34] <odd_slater> @lord0mugen No that's why I said what I said in the first part lol
[0:17:35] <%HunguyTV> HunguyTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:17:42] <23rald> this man plays GG
[0:17:51] <+Lord0Mugen> This game is so good
[0:17:57] <KyberNasse> Crusader is the Jesus who broke out of the cross
[0:18:02] <%leith_aziz> DP for days
[0:18:08] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta let me know if you make a new one and I'll try searching again
[0:18:09] <Triplicat> time to make lunch, someone make sure woolie learns how to do the disco ball
[0:18:10] <@Menitta> Im remaking the room. Search for 2P Remains and 8-9 players
[0:18:11] <+0neReeler> holylight
[0:18:15] <+Mrbaconator> ADAPT
[0:18:18] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta gotcha
[0:18:18] <+Lord0Mugen> Everything is dirty but feels right for some reason
[0:18:19] <+0neReeler> dp or counter
[0:18:23] <+Mrbaconator> this is fight of gods jesus but HD
[0:18:26] <+koalaf1ed> this game looks really simple.
[0:18:26] <Ardisan_> LEARN MIDMATCH LIKE ANIME
[0:18:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> i'm in the room, solidus
[0:18:43] <primaryfire> the run speed looks so sluggish
[0:18:58] <+rasend0ri> Your opponent seems like a real asshole.
[0:19:01] <+slayabee> J. b is a good button
[0:19:02] <%leith_aziz> Seeing this chat, im lucky I aint Christain. No offense to the religion, of course
[0:19:03] <quietshun> I think characters have different run speeds
[0:19:05] <+Lord0Mugen> @primaryfire yeah. it reminds me of Blade Strangers.
[0:19:05] <fuji_n2> damn grappler dash beats everything?
[0:19:08] <+McSoliace> @primaryfire tbf there the slowest characters in the game
[0:19:10] <+koalaf1ed> the amount self-expression per character seems limited
[0:19:12] <+Mrbaconator> "take that white life"
[0:19:12] <+0neReeler> maybe you have to punish the charge with a jump
[0:19:12] <+DeaconBluesClues> how do you grab in this
[0:19:14] <odd_slater> That one song that plays when you fight in the town is my favorite of this OST so far
[0:19:16] <Hoot_Patoots> take that white life
[0:19:20] <Ardisan_> Blade Strangers underrated
[0:19:21] <Triplicat> @DeaconBluesClues A+B
[0:19:22] <%MajorCrasher> this bit rate ain't great, game looks pretty poopy on my end
[0:19:22] <Guigondi> @DeaconBluesClues L1
[0:19:30] <the_ugliest_known> That armor move on grappler beats everything except a trip before he charged
[0:19:32] <%leith_aziz> "Take that, White life" pickyStare
[0:19:33] <@Menitta> oh yeah this kinda is like Blade Strangers
[0:19:45] <WaifusSansFrontieres> my only regret is we didnt get NEO: Striker
[0:19:51] <%dds333a> @menitta thete we fucking go
[0:19:52] <+SaurianCrash> oh! i made a room, and i can move!
[0:19:52] <WaifusSansFrontieres> her design is intense
[0:19:54] <%Shad0wTag> Menitta is your room still up? its not coming up a all for me
[0:20:00] <+Lord0Mugen> @Ardisan_ i REALLY like it. the combos are so fun to pull off and dont have that "canned" feeling so many 2D fighters have.
[0:20:00] <%dds333a> It was on my mind
[0:20:02] <@Menitta> I remade it with the same parameters
[0:20:14] <+slayabee> Super is NOT invul
[0:20:15] <+Lord0Mugen> @Ardisan_ its just a slow game is all
[0:20:17] <+FadingEmber> I fucking hate fighting games, but this game is my shit!
[0:20:19] <%Shad0wTag> god damn this is annoying
[0:20:22] <+rasend0ri> Don’t forget to grab
[0:20:27] <Hoot_Patoots> did you guys found a way to make rooms that don't constantly drop
[0:20:27] <Ardisan_> Yeah its easy to learn and the combos are suprisingly fun despite slow movement speed
[0:20:36] <+DeaconBluesClues> woolie should try wakup throw
[0:20:37] <Hoot_Patoots> SLAM
[0:20:39] <Triplicat> YOU BLOCKED THAT? ON GOD?
[0:20:41] <+Mrbaconator> holy light
[0:20:45] <+FanServ> is the game audio quality on the stream fuzzy or is it just me? the audio sounds very not crisp
[0:20:46] <President_valentine> was that off a trade?
[0:20:48] <+mgod19> praise be
[0:20:50] <%dds333a> @fadingember you should join the club Kappa
[0:20:51] <%Shad0wTag> WE PLAYING BIBBLE GAMES
[0:20:51] <FacetiousAF> mahamoan!
[0:20:52] <+tempestzephyr> GOD AND ANIME
[0:20:56] <Hoot_Patoots> yeah it's the stream sounding fuzzy
[0:21:00] <SilverFaustX> yes the game audio is shit
[0:21:01] <+Jrocy247> HE THE POWER OF GOD AND ANIME
[0:21:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> can't purify a grappler
[0:21:03] <+0neReeler> less damage than his combo LUL
[0:21:05] <primaryfire> audio is a bit crusty
[0:21:08] <%DashXero> No holy rollin' for you.
[0:21:10] <%leith_aziz> Now this is what we call a shonen anime
[0:21:14] <Ardisan_> Audio quality is off
[0:21:14] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus try wakeup throw
[0:21:24] <Equirah> Woolie, are you playing those bible games?
[0:21:25] <%Vigonept> bla bla bla challenger
[0:21:26] <+BackwardCap> A nice bnb is (A, A, Light wall, 2B, Light wall, 2S)
[0:21:28] <SilverFaustX> sounds like the game is coming tru the mic
[0:21:28] <Sapphire_Breeze> yeah the audio is muffled
[0:21:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 37 month streak! glad to be back. really wish dnfduel was like a normal beta with a damn training mode. and kof15's beta only has one character i care about playing with antanov
[0:21:39] <Bullethead1010> This game looks so good
[0:21:40] <Arqartur0> Crusader looks like the concept art of an MMO character
[0:21:45] <TheyCallMeVawn> The soundtrack so far is pretty godlike imo
[0:21:50] <TheOtherLen> he IS an mmo character
[0:22:00] <@Menitta> aight im just gonna disband the room. Not working it seems
[0:22:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that double Jesus, praise be
[0:22:04] <Ardisan_> He is a Beat em up mmo character so it makes sense
[0:22:05] <FlamingNarwhal> in general, game seems pretty good. the beta itself though sucks
[0:22:06] <%MajorCrasher> they're all mmo characters lol
[0:22:07] <+0neReeler> yo light light super?
[0:22:12] <Arqartur0> @TheOtherLen Specially with that super.
[0:22:12] <%Shad0wTag> yeah when I find it and try to join I get error messages
[0:22:13] <%dds333a> @arqartur0 then take his ten other variations and make them classes
[0:22:14] <+Mrbaconator> these are literally MMO characters
[0:22:14] <+mgod19> yoooooo
[0:22:15] <drefizz> they are testing the network, having a training mode would do then 0 favors
[0:22:16] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:22:16] <Hoot_Patoots> i've played a bit earlier too, tried a bunch of char and also been really liking the game, although yeah movement can be a bit sluggish. All the attack sounds are so crunchy tho
[0:22:17] <+Lord0Mugen> NO WAY
[0:22:20] <+FanServ> @WoolieVersus audio a bit muffled
[0:22:22] <+Taisuru> This man been grinding
[0:22:23] <23rald> PogChamp
[0:22:26] <%Shad0wTag> MAXIMUM JUDO
[0:22:28] <%TheBensonator_> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:22:29] <Arqartur0> that super tho
[0:22:33] <+Lord0Mugen> This is a FUCKING GAME
[0:22:37] <%Buttface_> Buttface_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! MY TIME HAS COME, AFTER 7 YEARS ULTIMAX IS REAL AGAIN
[0:22:47] <Moonblade92> grappler got dem vacuum hands like in the MMO. Grab has fireball range smh
[0:22:49] <%mr_sups> So is Crusader just Aganos?
[0:22:52] <+Lord0Mugen> Does barrier protect him?
[0:23:01] <+Lord0Mugen> @mr_sups not really
[0:23:02] <TacoBomber> Super armor
[0:23:07] <%dds333a> @mr_sups no
[0:23:09] <%Buttface_> grappler can grab extended hurtboxes
[0:23:12] <Hoot_Patoots> GRAPPLE THAT JESUS
[0:23:13] <%Giothegame> Barrier gives him armor and enhances moves
[0:23:17] <%therustystream> can you roll through the gaps in pressure?
[0:23:22] <Ardisan_> I might need to play Grapper next on the mmo then.
[0:23:23] <+0neReeler> can't counter a throw
[0:23:31] <+JaseAdrift> Nice
[0:23:33] <+DeaconBluesClues> R E A D S
[0:23:37] <Arqartur0> @Hoot_Patoots And on a week before his Birthday!
[0:23:40] <urkleturtle> how is grappler so generic yet so cool at the same time?
[0:23:45] <+Mrbaconator> jesus christ indeed
[0:23:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> raw super, damn he's good
[0:23:47] <+rasend0ri> That was raw
[0:23:52] <Puhff> LESGOOOOOO
[0:24:00] <Arqartur0> @urkleturtle Because Ryu, and Ryo
[0:24:04] <TacoBomber> grappler is surrounded by super anime lords and yet he's still able to hang with them with nothing more than his FISTS
[0:24:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:24:15] <Ardisan_> Grappler looks cooler than Ryo and Ryu ngl
[0:24:15] <+Lord0Mugen> This like fucked up able
[0:24:15] <+BackwardCap> Those awakening specials have no invuln btw. You can get hit out of it OWLSombra
[0:24:20] <Hoot_Patoots> Grappler reminds me of Butts from Garou
[0:24:25] <%therustystream> THAT WAS SICK
[0:24:28] <Hoot_Patoots> especially for his victory pose
[0:24:30] <+Taisuru> Why does grappler have better range than crusader lol
[0:24:31] <Moonblade92> woolie doesn't know the secret tech of setting up wall and just 2S spam
[0:24:34] <jashugan_1> BRUH what are these grappler combos this man is crazy
[0:24:35] <+Jrocy247> Man, Crusader seems REALLY stiff
[0:24:37] <+tempestzephyr> Bara jesus getting whooped
[0:24:40] <+Lord0Mugen> @Hoot_Patoots I was thinking of Able
[0:24:41] <haitakaa> seems like a bad matchup
[0:24:41] <+antares_000> Grappler combos look so sick
[0:24:54] <tolloponik> the Grappler Got Tired of waiting
[0:24:57] <%therustystream> you can change character in the lobby
[0:24:58] <KyberNasse> Armor King
[0:24:58] <@Menitta> They fixed that issue
[0:24:59] <+FanServ> @WoolieVersus game audio is a bit scuffed
[0:24:59] <+0neReeler> jump heavy is okish..
[0:25:01] <jashugan_1> try making a room
[0:25:01] <drefizz> wait til you learn the cheap stuff with Crusader
[0:25:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> @WoolieVersus the audio is a bit muffled btw
[0:25:06] <fuji_n2> they fixed woolie
[0:25:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> game audio*
[0:25:09] <crimsonsaens> Crazy Talk is invincible
[0:25:11] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:25:11] <fuji_n2> we've been saying
[0:25:14] <TacoBomber> Bara jesus' strength is in spacing people out really hard and using his counter when people get predictable
[0:25:14] <+0neReeler> same
[0:25:19] <+BackwardCap> They fixed it sajamSol
[0:25:20] <KyberNasse> LUL
[0:25:24] <KaiserMario> Farts
[0:25:25] <+FanServ> it's got a muffled quality to it
[0:25:26] <+McSoliace> muffled
[0:25:26] <+Jrocy247> It sounds like a Speaker
[0:25:27] <TanyaSaberFace> theres no space there between his name
[0:25:30] <FlamingNarwhal> sounds sorta muffled
[0:25:31] <TanyaSaberFace> it sound muted
[0:25:31] <Ardisan_> sounds muffled
[0:25:32] <Arqartur0> did they fixed it, unga?
[0:25:33] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus whats the search parameters on the room?
[0:25:34] <tolloponik> It was busted last night but they made a hot fix in like an hour
[0:25:34] <+tempestzephyr> could be clearer
[0:25:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> the volume is fine, it sounds like it's coming from a public bathroom
[0:25:39] <TheOtherLen> the game audio sounds a bit muffled, but you guys sound fine
[0:25:40] <+rasend0ri> You give up way to easily
[0:25:47] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Fine for me idk
[0:25:50] <+McSoliace> windows 10 maybe
[0:25:51] <@Menitta> People have been saying that its muffled. Sounds fine to me but idk.
[0:25:53] <%leith_aziz> Chill pickyLurk
[0:25:55] <TanyaSaberFace> the game doesnt have a space between the name and has
[0:25:56] <%Shad0wTag> I think the game audio is just a bit quiet
[0:25:58] <Equirah> sounds compressed
[0:25:59] <jashugan_1> sounds alright tbh
[0:25:59] <Arqartur0> to me it sounds fine
[0:26:02] <morow1ec> there WAS a windows update today
[0:26:03] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta same. sounds fine
[0:26:07] <aubelechy> its a strange twitch error
[0:26:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> did bed of chaos mess up the volume? maybe
[0:26:12] <+rasend0ri> Sounds fine
[0:26:14] <Jayfox82> it did sound muffled
[0:26:14] <%leith_aziz> Sound seems better now
[0:26:15] <+Akizea> dfo is fucking crazy Reggie lol
[0:26:18] <aubelechy> refresh until its better
[0:26:20] <+Taisuru> Son't play DFO, it's super predatory
[0:26:21] <+Jrocy247> @WoolieVersus Like the Audio legitimately sounds like it's coming through a speaker, on stream.
[0:26:23] <+slayabee> Who seems cool to you Reggie?
[0:26:27] <%dds333a> of course
[0:26:29] <+Lord0Mugen> 8ing so good at making fighting games......SOMETIMES!! *looks at Bloody Roar 4*
[0:26:32] <%leith_aziz> It seems like a Beat emup
[0:26:33] <GarbageNirvana> Did they finally give DFO controller support
[0:26:33] <+BackwardCap> Its a bug, the game audio becomes muffled when you connect an Awakening Super.
[0:26:33] <Ardisan_> @Taisuru No, I must play
[0:26:35] <Moonblade92> qlso somekne tell reggie to wait for DNF Overkill or Project BBQ if he is interested in Dungeon Fighter.
[0:26:37] <childofthebean> what characters have you guys been playing I chose exquisiter
[0:26:38] <%MajorCrasher> DFO is essentially an MMO with an arcade beat em up aesthetic
[0:26:44] <+DreyfussFrost> From what I understand, Dungeon Fighter is like if you turned Streets of Rage into a free-to-play MMO or something?
[0:26:45] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus does this game have a chipp?
[0:26:51] <%dds333a> Boy were there plenty of mechanics in DFO
[0:26:55] <tolloponik> think maple story with dynasty wars but the art style and gameplay actually looks cool
[0:26:56] <primaryfire> did inquisitor also make bosses hold the wheel for 25 seconds
[0:26:57] <+Lord0Mugen> @DreyfussFrost yes
[0:26:58] <%leith_aziz> @DreyfussFrost That's what I understood
[0:26:58] <FlamingNarwhal> yeha dfo is an mmo streets of rage style beat em up
[0:27:00] <+Jrocy247> Was this some MMO or some Gacha?
[0:27:02] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus use room settings more specific than default otherwise people wont be able to find it
[0:27:02] <th3_gaming_dumb> kunoichi
[0:27:04] <TheyCallMeVawn> DFO is absurdly popular apparently
[0:27:11] <+Lord0Mugen> @Jrocy247 OLD ASS BEATEM UP
[0:27:13] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @DreyfussFrost pretty much and its not even that grindy if you dont wanna go into competitive endgame shit
[0:27:15] <%leith_aziz> In Asia sepcifically
[0:27:24] <+Lord0Mugen> DFO died and then came back. like Jesus
[0:27:24] <Ardisan_> DFO is the highest grossing MMO I heard
[0:27:30] <JdotSweapA> yeah that about sums it up
[0:27:38] <jimgimp> DFO has OVAs
[0:27:43] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @Jrocy247 no gacha, you just make your character like you want

[0:28:18] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a never mention that garbage
[0:28:19] <KyberNasse> That woke me up
[0:28:22] <th3_gaming_dumb> movelist you gotta find online
[0:28:23] <ChansonNoire> its a hardcore grinding kmmo
[0:28:24] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus DFO is good
[0:28:25] <ajmgamesdev> Lmao FIGHT MY MANS MOON MIST
[0:28:30] <FlamingNarwhal> its a fun time, doesnt require as much work as other mmos
[0:28:31] <JdotSweapA> its ok. not really
[0:28:32] <+gatdragon> Anyone else get ear raped?
[0:28:32] <+SaurianCrash> can you all move?
[0:28:32] <+Lord0Mugen> if you like Korean MMOs
[0:28:33] <+rasend0ri> Not really
[0:28:34] <%MajorCrasher> it's fun
[0:28:34] <passserby> Nexon's involved so no
[0:28:36] <Daxalog> Would you like to a beat em up that looks like a game you would play on a Verizon Flipphone?
[0:28:38] <+mgod19> very grindy
[0:28:38] <%leith_aziz> It's a beatem up with MMO elements- If that's your thing, go for it
[0:28:40] <tolloponik> yeah
[0:28:42] <Arqartur0> yes
[0:28:43] <%Vigonept> ye
[0:28:43] <@Menitta> Audio is fine
[0:28:43] <+ChaosEmralds> i hear its pretty grindy, but it is an mmo
[0:28:47] <+Jrocy247> Fixed
[0:28:47] <+Lord0Mugen> great
[0:28:47] <%Prevot> mmos are never worth it
[0:28:48] <TanyaSaberFace> bout the same
[0:28:48] <haisho> ye it's clearer now
[0:28:51] <odd_slater> Yes father Woolie
[0:28:51] <TheNeonCaster> Sounds fine!
[0:28:52] <%Shad0wTag> Yeah tahts better
[0:28:56] <%Shad0wTag> Thanks Woolz!
[0:28:57] <jimgimp> @dds333a I actually have yet to watch any fighting games adaptations was planning to start with the Street Fighter movies
[0:28:57] <+mgod19> can be pretty boring leveling your character to cap
[0:29:01] <aveond> Played DFO for years, can confirm its grindy as hell but SUPER fun
[0:29:02] <TacoBomber> @samsaric_prisoner Forward, down, and back with Special or MP (or QCF/QCB/DP+MP)is pretty much the entire moveset for everyone, plus or minus some charging or hitting the button again or in the air
[0:29:05] <@Menitta> I dont hear a difference lmao. Sounded fine before
[0:29:07] <rommlll> woolie?
[0:29:07] <%Shad0wTag> Tell us the room specfications!
[0:29:30] <+Lord0Mugen> I LOVE the passives stuffs
[0:29:31] <@Menitta> Hitman is fun as fuck
[0:29:31] <Idon__> this css theme is pretty great
[0:29:31] <Ardisan_> Hitman is Dante
[0:29:33] <tolloponik> there's! the character select
[0:29:35] <%Giothegame> Everyone loves Color 6 on Crusader
[0:29:38] <+Taisuru> Hitman is JUST Dante
[0:29:40] <%dds333a> Hitman was one of the NEW dudes LUL
[0:29:40] <%Giothegame> DFO is barely grindy
[0:29:41] <@Menitta> DNF has two dantes
[0:29:41] <nintega010> Grapplers fun
[0:29:41] <primaryfire> ky kiske lookin ass
[0:29:41] <%Demoli_PT> yoo why does that guy have a smg
[0:29:46] <%Prevot> ALL these chars look cool
[0:29:47] <Moonblade92> hey cool thing about this character select, there's room for 6 more charas
[0:29:47] <%townzzzzz> grind his soul away
[0:29:47] <Fiendmaw> Hitman looks cool but has absolutely no sauce
[0:29:48] <%leith_aziz> Arcsys is really good with attention to detail. Almost every move in DBFZ has some inspiration/refrence behind it
[0:29:48] <+FoxLex_> We need the room specifications to get in
[0:29:49] <+SaurianCrash> 2p remains
[0:29:54] <%Giothegame> You level up so fast in DFO
[0:30:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the fighting does sound and look cool granted
[0:30:08] <%dds333a> I remember people hated hitman because he clashes, but he played great
[0:30:12] <+rasend0ri> Korean propaganda
[0:30:16] <%leith_aziz> Praise the Sun!
[0:30:20] <aveond> @Giothegame Once you reach raid prereq's it becomes hellish but besides that it isn't too bad
[0:30:21] <+Lord0Mugen> Theres A LOT of cool characters that could come into this game
[0:30:22] <KineticZen> Woolie vs God if God won
[0:30:22] <+Jrocy247> The of power....OF RELIGION
[0:30:26] <haisho> last I touched it DFO wasn't grindy unless you were doing endgame grinding
[0:30:28] <+Akizea> I've unironically wanted this fighting game for 10 years
[0:30:30] <samsaric_prisoner> @samsaric_prisoner Yeah I noticed the inputs pretty much being universal
[0:30:42] <KyberNasse> Order Max
[0:30:46] <+gatdragon> For a sec thought crusader had no audio
[0:30:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, japanese voices, just realized, so it won't be korean voices only
[0:30:49] <+TraitorousAlf> wait crusader can shorten the screen :O
[0:30:51] <@Menitta> the meter is weird. It constantly refills
[0:30:52] <WhatzePh> Wasn't Mihn the one who got to lvl 99 in the starting area of FFXV? If so, I wouldn't trust his opinion on grinding.
[0:31:00] <%leith_aziz> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Are they not talking in korean?
[0:31:02] <jimgimp> Wait this is Arcsys? holy shit
[0:31:08] <fluke_LKZ> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ There are Kr, CN and JP voice languages.
[0:31:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:31:11] <TacoBomber> The inputs are universal but the way they chain together varies from character to character I think
[0:31:11] <odd_slater> I've seen something on Twitter where someone was just bouncing people of that wall with crusader
[0:31:12] <+Taisuru> Getting that barrier up seems important
[0:31:14] <aveond> you can LL wall LL tackle/low infinite
[0:31:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ right now it sounds like japanese to me
[0:31:20] <FlamingNarwhal> the game has korean japanese and chinese voice options
[0:31:21] <+Lord0Mugen> @jimgimp PUBLISHED by Arcsys. 8ing made the game
[0:31:22] <fuji_n2> skill is just a heavy
[0:31:24] <%Shad0wTag> Reggie, Eventhubs has the full move list
[0:31:25] <jimgimp> Ah
[0:31:26] <+McSoliace> tvc braroque system is here
[0:31:28] <jashugan_1> arc sys did the visuals but 8ing have made the game is what ive gathered
[0:31:29] <fuji_n2> mp skill are specials
[0:31:35] <FlamingNarwhal> you can also choose language for each character individually
[0:31:36] <xerotwo> AEGIS
[0:31:57] <Idon__> that counter animation is brutal LUL
[0:31:58] <%leith_aziz> @Lord0Mugen No, NEXON is the publisher. We have no idea exactly what 8ting and Arcsys are involved in
[0:32:04] <TigerClaws12> striker has reverse beats
[0:32:05] <@Solidus_113> striker is a gorilla
[0:32:06] <aveond> 'sader is very MP heavy so you'd be doing lights into mS and loop it
[0:32:07] <jimgimp> I guess DFO is more beloved than I actaully realized
[0:32:16] <+Jrocy247> Man, I can't keep up with Fighting Game Language.
[0:32:17] <%leith_aziz> It seems like Arcsys mainly work on the presentation, but it could be more for all we know
[0:32:33] <%Shad0wTag> @jimgimp Its big in the Asias it seems
[0:32:34] <+Lord0Mugen> @leith_aziz thats probable
[0:32:35] <xerotwo> Wpw
[0:32:38] <xerotwo> wow
[0:32:43] <aveond> @jimgimp ain't it the biggest MMO in korea and one of the biggest in china too?
[0:32:46] <%leith_aziz> @Jrocy247 Every game can have different terminology. Take them one at a time
[0:32:54] <Frampis> How do u get Japanese voices? I have Korean atm
[0:32:59] <Triplicat> we are so close to disco ball
[0:33:10] <odd_slater> Options menu @frampis
[0:33:11] <jashugan_1> the korean sounds sick to me
[0:33:11] <aveond> couching light becomes an infinite with the shield buff on lmao
[0:33:12] <stormhawk9891> @Frampis It's in Language options
[0:33:14] <Dragon_Batman> Hiya, how's everyone doing?

[0:33:34] <jimgimp> @aveond I knew it was big but I never realised it was big enough to get something like this devoted to it
[0:33:41] <+Jrocy247> That Cross Wall is a pretty effective move
[0:33:43] <jimgimp> Other than the ovas
[0:33:44] <aveond> ahhhh resepct respect

[0:34:12] <aveond> light light wall, light light tackle
[0:34:14] <+Lord0Mugen> Vanguard seems to be Aquaman from Injustice where hes about chipping you out with his spear despite not really having any combos
[0:34:16] <Dragon_Batman> @Dragon_Batman Sorry to hear, hope it passes soon
[0:34:23] <aveond> or light light wall, light buff and couching light spam lol
[0:34:35] <SethYuikora> Father Reggimus?

[0:35:52] <GraphicJon> I have the power of God and Anime on my side
[0:35:52] <TigerClaws12> light light again after wall
[0:35:53] <tolloponik> if this is what Jesus gives you I wonder what other religions could give
[0:35:56] <%leith_aziz> I wanna keep watching, but I think im gonna have to take a break. Im getting really tired, sorry
[0:36:06] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz peace dude take it easy
[0:36:09] <Saltmeisterr> i see woolie has gravitated to the WORD OF GOD
[0:36:10] <Daxalog> Mana comes back so fast I wonder whats even the point of sacrificing health for mana
[0:36:11] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus After the buff you can press it again to spend it on an attack
[0:36:18] <Dragon_Batman> @Dragon_Batman You're very welcome LuvSign
[0:36:19] <aveond> have to do 2 lights after the wall
[0:36:20] <TigerClaws12> light light again after wall into tackle
[0:36:22] <%leith_aziz> @leith_aziz pickyFive1 pickyFive2
[0:36:22] <+slayabee> Utilize those B buttons
[0:36:27] <+Lord0Mugen> @Daxalog Combo extensions and cancels
[0:36:29] <+SaurianCrash> crusader is just Urian
[0:36:31] <urkleturtle> @tolloponik being jewish definitely gives you a golem summon
[0:36:33] <CarlTheBlind> when the wall is up the danger is time
[0:36:38] <Dragon_Batman> But man I just had a rough session with Grappler against Berserker whew
[0:36:51] <%dds333a> @sauriancrash CRUSH
[0:36:52] <Bullethead1010> does this game have single button specials?
[0:37:02] <+Lord0Mugen> yep
[0:37:04] <CarlTheBlind> @Bullethead1010 command normal specials
[0:37:12] <%Shad0wTag> @Bullethead1010 with different directions but there is also the option to do motions
[0:37:16] <%Moonblade92> @daxalog it comes back quick but you burn it super fast too. The cancel is a rebound mechanic I imagine.
[0:37:16] <CrimsonContrast> @bullethead1010 yeah it does
[0:37:16] <+DudeTheMoose> even your super is just one button press
[0:37:18] <Dragon_Batman> With meter and without
[0:37:25] <President_valentine> I want them to experience the Inquisitor's Wheel of Torture
[0:37:42] <@Menitta> if I can get a match in I will be inquisitor
[0:37:43] <+Akizea> that wheel is fucking OPPRESSIVE
[0:37:45] <CarlTheBlind> @President_valentine ive seen some fucked up corner lockdown off of it
[0:37:51] <jashugan_1> iquisitor wheel and kunoichi flame tornado is suffering lmao
[0:37:54] <+gatdragon> PogChamp
[0:37:56] <Dragon_Batman> I think you can input the same input just after
[0:38:01] <aveond> ^
[0:38:06] <%Moonblade92> yo someone hit up woolie the hammer swing he does before the BIG HAMMER is his combo
[0:38:18] <%Moonblade92> just spamming that next to cross while in Install
[0:38:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[0:38:20] <President_valentine> Kuno is like Rashid on crack
[0:38:32] <+DudeTheMoose> oooo that looks nice
[0:38:33] <aveond> if you do it in the air I think it's apocalypse
[0:38:34] <Triplicat> air 214MS after install
[0:38:40] <Mirakei> I think what makes the Wheel really strong is that you actually don't need 90 mana to do it. If you have less than 90 it just puts you into exhaustion which isn't that bad
[0:38:50] <+slayabee> If you do back-MP in the air after the buff it does another attack
[0:38:55] <@Menitta> oh wow the beta just crashed now for me
[0:38:58] <DeathByPoke7> we playing bible games
[0:39:12] <%dds333a> @menitta fantastic LUL

[0:39:54] <@Menitta> I wanna play with people tho woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:39:56] <+xiaolinstyle> a, a can be followed by 6+MP, b, MP
[0:40:02] <%Giothegame> @WoolieVersus If you do the input for the barrier again you spend it for a big move on the ground or in the air
[0:40:02] <aveond> pop buff then baroque and you should have the meter to do it
[0:40:03] <%Shad0wTag> I feel like our best bet is to join existin busy lobbies
[0:40:04] <+McSoliace> you can sacrifice gray life for more meter
[0:40:08] <%Shad0wTag> if they even let you

[0:41:57] <%InvisiblessedReptile> Look at this apparently perfectly functional and good-looking lobby
[0:41:59] <@Solidus_113> grey life
[0:42:03] <+wardenofwinter> Lol homie want's the matches
[0:42:05] <AllenDeadman> Gray life
[0:42:11] <+xiaolinstyle> blocking some attacks
[0:42:12] <%notsoy> i believe throws do half/half and reversals do all grey
[0:42:12] <maubpp> block stun = white damage
[0:42:15] <nintega010> grappler time
[0:42:15] <%Shad0wTag> I wish I could actually join a lobby
[0:42:16] <+SaurianCrash> blocking gets white heath
[0:42:17] <ajmgamesdev> THIS IS NY FRIEND HAHAH
[0:42:19] <%Shad0wTag> error messages constantly
[0:42:20] <Idon__> Grappler looks so sick for such a dumb name LUL
[0:42:21] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Grey life like SFV
[0:42:25] <+Akizea> crazy how there's vids for this
[0:42:33] <Dragon_Batman> Depends on how much white you have
[0:42:34] <+rasend0ri> Go watch the 30 second video on YouTube
[0:42:36] <aveond> Gives enough for followups
[0:42:36] <%notsoy> it's baroque on roids
[0:42:37] <SethYuikora> and increases your maximum meter
[0:42:43] <xXVeggiePLusXx> It increases your maximum meter
[0:42:56] <%dds333a> @idon__ that's his class LUL
[0:42:58] <Gmanblack> @moonblade92 bro they can combo into it and get instant corner combo potential. One dude did the same down smash on me 6 times cuz he caught me trying to jump out
[0:43:01] <+xiaolinstyle> a,a, 6+MP, b, MP
[0:43:12] <+McSoliace> it also increases your meter
[0:43:12] <Triplicat> yeah so if you don't do it it will just heal over time like regular grey life
[0:43:13] <%InvisiblessedReptile> of course woolie is playing the broken boss character (it's a joke)
[0:43:15] <urkleturtle> yeah, the demo seems like a terrible way to show off all these interesting mechanics
[0:43:25] <+Flarepulse> was that a train boat
[0:43:32] <%MajorCrasher> yes
[0:43:34] <%Qsmash_> beta tests aren't demos
[0:43:35] <+xiaolinstyle> bubble lets you chain B to SP
[0:43:43] <Hoarseplay> @Flarepulse It's the seatrain.
[0:43:46] <HajimeNoFraming> I like these character designs so far
[0:43:48] <Daxalog> Whos that croc in the background? I want to play as him/her
[0:43:56] <jubejube56> I like that he doesn't use his hammer for the magic holy hammer attacks
[0:44:01] <+Lionhart16> wait, can Grappler charge all his MP directional attacks?
[0:44:08] <aveond> @Daxalog a boss from this area, he might be a boss in arcade mode
[0:44:13] <%MajorCrasher> @daxalog that's an enemy lol
[0:44:14] <Idon__> yeah his movelist has normal and "held" versions for all attacks
[0:44:27] <xxHungryxx> The two characters I want to try
[0:44:29] <+McSoliace> dodge is his way to move faster i believe
[0:44:31] <@Menitta> niiiice
[0:44:31] <Idon__> oh my god he's got LASERS
[0:44:31] <+DudeTheMoose> so sick
[0:44:31] <aveond> he's also a whoooooole bastard that wants you to cough up a couple million gold for you to progress the story in dfo lmao
[0:44:33] <+Lionhart16> @idon__ ah. I should really look at the list
[0:44:34] <%Giothegame> You can do it on the ground too
[0:44:35] <Hoarseplay> @Daxalog That's Commodore Cannonhand. He's the boss of the stage.
[0:44:36] <LunarFlash> throw that wall up
[0:44:36] <urkleturtle> disco!
[0:44:38] <FacetiousAF> OKAY
[0:44:38] <ElPlasa> GAD DAYUM

[0:44:43] <%dds333a> party time
[0:44:43] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:44:44] <Ardisan_> There is some insane pressure tools in this game
[0:44:46] <%InvisiblessedReptile> Crusader is like Nine and Ramlethal at the same time
[0:44:50] <+DudeTheMoose> Disco Jesus
[0:44:52] <SpookyBeef7> Okay, yeah, that move fucking lasts. LUL
[0:44:53] <jl_arts> Disco Jesus

[0:45:03] <%InvisiblessedReptile> And Astaroth
[0:45:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is this stage on a giant boat train? that's wild
[0:45:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I hope we get a wide variety of challengers in this stream, seems like there are many pretty interesting characters
[0:45:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:45:31] <DXLelouch24> @reallybigrocks Oceanic Express yea
[0:45:34] <xxHungryxx> Both if these characters are sick
[0:45:41] <DXLelouch24> Aquatic train
[0:45:49] <Ravoric> Grappler looks like ordinary guy vs fucking anime characters LUL
[0:45:59] <FacetiousAF> holy order hammer
[0:46:04] <aveond> oceanic express 2nd best stage
[0:46:09] <Ardisan_> Wow boat trains? Thats a cool asf idea
[0:46:09] <+DudeTheMoose> do you auto swing if the tackle connects or do you have to hit a button?
[0:46:10] <%InvisiblessedReptile> 2 steps away from being in Warhammer
[0:46:12] <%dds333a> lot of tithes and offerings coming in LUL
[0:46:16] <SethYuikora> Pay your TITHES!
[0:46:19] <+xiaolinstyle> OG Crusader used a hammer shaped like a cross
[0:46:21] <Hoarseplay> @DudeTheMoose auto
[0:46:25] <+rasend0ri> They don’t pay taxes so….
[0:46:32] <LunarFlash> the game feels good
[0:46:44] <%InvisiblessedReptile> that walk, though
[0:46:49] <+DudeTheMoose> Grappler learned his lesson before about the disco ball
[0:46:55] <Dragon_Batman> Grappler having it rough
[0:47:15] <+tempestzephyr> damn
[0:47:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dp'nt

[0:47:30] <SethYuikora> might be able to conversion into a punish
[0:47:32] <nintega010> trying to find woolies room
[0:47:38] <xxHungryxx> these two plus ranger & vanguard are cool
[0:47:42] <%Shad0wTag> @xxHungryxx yeah good luck
[0:47:46] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:48:00] <%InvisiblessedReptile> definitely feels a bit like Nine, her spells go away after getting hit
[0:48:08] <ElPlasa> the dodge roll is crazier than I thought it would be
[0:48:19] <Lazy_Vagabond> there is a alpha counter thing don't remember the input
[0:48:24] <+DudeTheMoose> whats the input for the counter?
[0:48:26] <jubejube56> This characters so weird, like he seems to want to keep you out but also creates a wall that would prevent escape or something
[0:48:31] <LunarFlash> Counter!
[0:48:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Holy shit, is EVERYONE in this game hot AF?
[0:48:41] <%notsoy> alpha counter is forward + m + s while in blockstun
[0:48:42] <+Jrocy247> Seems like it got fixed
[0:48:42] <Triplicat> 4S is crusader's counter if you mean that
[0:48:43] <AllenDeadman> Last night people killed the servers
[0:48:47] <%Shad0wTag> @CappuccinoGuil yes
[0:48:47] <AllenDeadman> LUL
[0:48:49] <Hoarseplay> @DudeTheMoose 4S. Crusader only.
[0:48:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah apparently the servers died yesterday, among other things
[0:48:50] <ElPlasa> I was expecting it to be more like a HC roll where you maybe low profile, but it looks more like a smash roll
[0:49:01] <Ardisan_> Look at this babby chibi shit lmao. God damnit Arc Sys
[0:49:03] <%Vigonept> @cappuccinoguil ugly doesnt sell my man
[0:49:09] <quietshun> Better that ther servers die in the beta than on full release
[0:49:10] <+DudeTheMoose> yeah I got about 6 matches as Crusader before it was a bust last night
[0:49:12] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @Ardisan_ shut up, I live for this
[0:49:12] <+rasend0ri> Change character
[0:49:13] <+wardenofwinter> Better than strives lobby system
[0:49:17] <%Shad0wTag> @Ardisan_ would you rather have the habbo hotel strive has>
[0:49:19] <%Shad0wTag> 8?
[0:49:20] <@Menitta> ooooh yeah
[0:49:29] <@Menitta> PS4 sticks dont work on the PS5 version
[0:49:32] <%Giothegame> They forgot to put in legacy controller I think
[0:49:35] <+DudeTheMoose> Ps5 is having legacy stick issues
[0:49:38] <TigerClaws12> legacy support is not in
[0:49:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil @Shad0wTag Based Arksys supporting us queers as always, making their characters all hot, bless them
[0:49:44] <@Menitta> Yup
[0:49:45] <+DudeTheMoose> PS4 is ok though
[0:49:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:49:57] <+LastHazzerd> this is why folk hate that sony keeps getting the betas
[0:49:59] <@Menitta> That was the cherry on top for my issues
[0:50:00] <destinyspider> So they banned this shit over here in germany apparently
[0:50:01] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:02] <+0neReeler> have to download the ps4 version rip
[0:50:03] <Retolee> its a beta

[0:50:12] <thaprinnydood> oh sony
[0:50:15] <nintega010> can ps4 play with ps5
[0:50:18] <+DudeTheMoose> Its fine on PS4 and they said it would be fixed on PS5 for release
[0:50:18] <Arqartur0> :(
[0:50:23] <destinyspider> I hate this country lol
[0:50:25] <jubejube56> The game is around a year out right?
[0:50:30] <%Shad0wTag> @CappuccinoGuil I'd be lying by saying I was queer in anyway but I appreciate characters look hot for everyone
[0:50:30] <Hoarseplay> There's a button check at the bottom.
[0:50:36] <+DudeTheMoose> yeah
[0:50:43] <@Menitta> you can play the ps4 version onn ps5, thats what I did
[0:50:44] <Triplicat> OH I KNOW WHAT HOLD A+B means now
[0:50:45] <Triplicat> lmao
[0:50:50] <Triplicat> that's their translation of Throw
[0:50:59] <Triplicat> it doesn't mean literally hold down A+B
[0:51:02] <fuji_n2> man there isn't a way of leaving a spectator match is there?
[0:51:02] <spawnzie> that's grab
[0:51:04] <Jayfox82> its throw
[0:51:04] <+rasend0ri> Do it
[0:51:05] <@Menitta> though now I'm wondering does this have crossplay? It has to right?
[0:51:12] <%Deasmeister> a b is throw

[0:54:48] <MOON__MIST> Good games woolie, didn't expect the wake-up reversals a lot, sonic_sol played against an insane crusader
[0:54:52] <Triplicat> roll should be strike invul but not throw invul
[0:55:04] <@Menitta> the combo potential with Striker is hiiiiigh
[0:55:08] <SethYuikora> the beyblade
[0:55:09] <Civet10> gordeau?
[0:55:10] <redhotdivekick> Striker has reverse beat btw

[0:55:36] <+slayabee> Down MP is her DP
[0:55:41] <JayEarly> I don’t know whether to play striker or inquisitor first
[0:55:42] <+Strahlenwaffeln> 2b
[0:55:43] <President_valentine> Inquisitor has the coolest round victory pose
[0:55:46] <+Dova573> has woolie become Minh?
[0:55:47] <+xiaolinstyle> 2B
[0:55:51] <+wardenofwinter> That move kills the bitrate LUL
[0:55:54] <%dds333a> ouch
[0:55:55] <TheNeonCaster> There's someone incredibly more Gordeau on this cast
[0:55:55] <President_valentine> The Wheel
[0:55:55] <Triplicat> that move is so funny
[0:55:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> get into wheel games
[0:55:57] <TigerClaws12> it's not that scary on block, guard button
[0:55:57] <@Menitta> it really is out there
[0:55:59] <LiquidBinge> Why is the audio all fucky
[0:56:09] <%mighty_max_t> l
[0:56:11] <CappuccinoGuil> Is that the wheel of fate that I hear so much about? It sure is turning
[0:56:13] <TheNeonCaster> Vaguard's buttons fill all the screen all day
[0:56:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> return of the wheel skeleton
[0:56:18] <jubejube56> what if I just used the entire screen as oki?
[0:56:21] <+xiaolinstyle> her uppercut is jump cancelable
[0:56:25] <Triplicat> losing max health
[0:56:26] <%Giothegame> Lower HP
[0:56:26] <Dragon_Batman> @LiquidBinge Pause and play again, your vid is trying to catch up
[0:56:28] <cheesyman100> yes basically
[0:56:28] <%leith_aziz> Im up again. How are you chat?
[0:56:29] <TigerClaws12> lower health = more meter
[0:56:30] <ChansonNoire> lower health
[0:56:32] <%mighty_max_t> Bitrate wheel go brrrr
[0:56:32] <JayEarly> can you hold back to block?
[0:56:33] <+ReverandSavage> time, losing health and attacking it looks like
[0:56:33] <tolloponik> giving and taking damage
[0:56:33] <FlamingNarwhal> lower hp more meter
[0:56:34] <crimsonsaens> Lower HP = more meter
[0:56:34] <Retolee> lower health
[0:56:34] <%HollowedIdjit> Lower HP Higher MP
[0:56:36] <spawnzie> It's health
[0:56:37] <SethYuikora> conversion of white health adds more
[0:56:38] <jimgimp> Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
[0:56:39] <Triplicat> it raises your max MP based on the LOWEST HP you've ever reached
[0:56:42] <xxHungryxx> damn
[0:56:43] <AllenDeadman> the less HP the more meter yes
[0:56:44] <+GarouFGC> Yes, Its locked behind white life.
[0:56:44] <+McSoliace> losing hp or conversion cancel
[0:56:48] <@Solidus_113> fatal blow MK11
[0:56:48] <+slayabee> Lower health
[0:56:48] <Triplicat> this is relevant because you can heal back white life
[0:56:52] <TurkinaKeshik> At ~30%

[0:56:59] <%Giothegame> Your HP becomes really red

[0:57:00] <TigerClaws12> below 30% hp
[0:57:01] <+Strahlenwaffeln> super is at the biggr zone on the healthbar
[0:57:02] <AllenDeadman> tekken rage
[0:57:04] <Triplicat> awakening is the notch on the health UI
[0:57:04] <jubejube56> It's basically tekken
[0:57:08] <%leith_aziz> Basically, Tekken 7 Rage
[0:57:13] <primaryfire> wonder if the duration of the wheel is faithful to dfo
[0:57:21] <@Menitta> supers shouldnt be a comback mechanic from health imo
[0:57:24] <%Giothegame> You can see where the gradient is separated on the HP bar
[0:57:24] <HajimeNoFraming> streams bitrate busting a nut
[0:57:25] <+GarouFGC> Basically, Fatal Fury Desperation.
[0:57:26] <TurkinaKeshik> There is a notch on HP bar for when you can do super and your passive kicks in
[0:57:32] <jubejube56> though the supers so far seem very lack luster
[0:57:37] <Hoarseplay> @primaryfire it's longer in DFO
[0:57:39] <jubejube56> the passive benefits might be better
[0:57:41] <Triplicat> your character's passive activates and your life bar glows a deep red to show you can use your super once (it will change color again after you use it)
[0:57:47] <%dds333a> Gradual Desperation mode LUL

[0:59:35] <Lurkestlurker> Is online working?
[0:59:38] <+weaster4> at 30% hp, you either keep ur awakening pasive or spend it to use a super
[0:59:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> a side scroller mmo? that sounds interesting
[0:59:41] <Triplicat> we went from woolie playing one of the slowest non-canceling chars to reggie playing one of the fastest most-cancels chars lol

[1:00:24] <xxHungryxx> wheel kills 🤘
[1:00:36] <+NopeBadguy> did that firewheel just kill the bitrate
[1:00:47] <@Menitta> whats funny about the wheel is if they;re blocking it, you can just run up to them, push them out of block stun and boom free grab
[1:00:53] <th3_gaming_dumb> when blocking forward medium+s is het of me tool
[1:00:54] <Triplicat> YEYEYEYE

[1:01:07] <+FlyingRamen> sucj
[1:01:07] <JayEarly> @menitta that seems somewhat broken
[1:01:07] <Triplicat> DP does not cost HP

[1:01:23] <%dds333a> to say less of maplestory

[1:04:53] <haisho> playing Striker in DFO made my hands hurt so much
[1:04:55] <BlackermanZX> did they try hitman
[1:04:58] <@Solidus_113> grappler can hold his buttons
[1:05:03] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he can
[1:05:03] <%dds333a> not yet
[1:05:07] <NotHereToStream> grappler is pretty difficult
[1:05:10] <+SaurianCrash> if you can hit confirm you can get the super out of it quick ;p;
[1:05:16] <+FlyingRamen> Monk in dfo was wild
[1:05:17] <th3_gaming_dumb> you can switch chars after every match actually if the room has the right settings
[1:05:26] <+Lionhart16> Grappler is momentum incarnate.

[1:07:32] <SethYuikora> his shoryu is a command grab, and idk how to feel about that
[1:07:38] <%townzzzzz> this is OUR SCHOOL
[1:07:38] <TigerClaws12> SNK shoto for sure
[1:07:43] <JayEarly> I think grapplers who aren’t giants like this guy and Kouma are cool
[1:07:43] <Triplicat> oh THAT'S what his anti-air grab reminds me of; it's C-Nanaya's DP+follow-up from melty

[1:08:22] <+Rafraud> so is this game all directional inputs?
[1:08:26] <tolloponik> they saw those GG mods and said we can do better
[1:08:26] <Triplicat> it's pretty bad but not as bad as the intro from Million Arthur Arcana Blood
[1:08:29] <%Giothegame> You can charge grappler super to suck them in
[1:08:30] <%leith_aziz> That moment of you both spamming the smae move was funny
[1:08:44] <+GarouFGC> I've had so much fun with Grappler.. Probably my favorite "Grappler" type so far. He's got some tech but he's not easy.
[1:08:48] <%leith_aziz> Unga brains here
[1:08:53] <Hoarseplay> @Triplicat At least I can understand Million Arthur.
[1:09:00] <%Animatic_> Animatic_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:09:01] <Dragon_Batman> The meter ones you can do inputs for but there doesn't seem to be a perk to it

[1:11:49] <+0neReeler> gorilla mirror
[1:11:58] <Dragon_Batman> Buttons into back S works
[1:12:07] <xerotwo> RIDER KICK!!!!!
[1:12:08] <tolloponik> two gorillas enter the ring only one can become pure UNGA
[1:12:14] <Ozmodyas> Pat prefers his grapplers huge and heavy so this one might not be his cup of tea
[1:12:17] <Afrosamasenpai> If only it had a training mode
[1:12:22] <%dds333a> the eternal test of strength
[1:12:23] <%mr_sups> If only you could go into training mode
[1:12:26] <+Radiantomega> holding the button changes properties for him
[1:12:29] <Dragon_Batman> Neutral S is advance grab
[1:12:30] <SethYuikora> "You got me down to 30%, time to lose 50%"
[1:12:31] <Hoarseplay> grab is neutral S,
[1:12:31] <Ardisan_> I always feel like someone is gonna die when specials happen but nobody dies
[1:12:32] <%cubbywolf> pat would like crusader then

[1:12:42] <spawnzie> hold neutral S
[1:12:42] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:12:43] <JayEarly> any 0 to death combos found yet?

[1:12:59] <+SaurianCrash> touch of death?
[1:13:10] <%cubbywolf> there's no training mode so no
[1:13:14] <+SaurianCrash> not sure you could keep it up that long
[1:13:27] <%MajorCrasher> guys training mode will be in the full game. betas normally aren't supposed to have them. if it does it's probably not a real beta
[1:13:29] <Dragon_Batman> His charged Mp stuff has armor but it starts late
[1:13:32] <%dds333a> haagen dasz

[1:14:14] <Retolee> @JayEarly news should be coming at their winter fes, which is after this ends
[1:14:16] <%cubbywolf> he knows he said but did he truly know
[1:14:25] <Dragon_Batman> The world may never know
[1:14:29] <+crybirb> The game time / damage is what I wanted for Strive :(
[1:14:35] <didgereedoodah> hope this comes to pc
[1:14:41] <gunstars20> YOINK
[1:14:43] <+kumaprime> Grappler is fun as hell
[1:14:50] <%dds333a> truly a frightening power
[1:14:52] <SethYuikora> apparently it vacuums if you hold it
[1:15:00] <LoreKeeper_Thal> PC version is confirmed I believe
[1:15:01] <BlackermanZX> Melee Marth grab range
[1:15:06] <+Strahlenwaffeln> @didgereedoodah its already confirmed i think. also DFO is a PC game would be stupid not to do it on pc
[1:15:08] <%MajorCrasher> ooh it's a hold
[1:15:16] <haisho> the one thing I seem to have learned from watching this is to not jump against Grappler
[1:15:18] <jashugan_1> geto ver here
[1:15:25] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it just didn't got a beta because datamining
[1:15:30] <Fiendmaw> This game is made for Korea and China mostly,it will have a PC ver
[1:15:31] <Dragon_Batman> Down S is a counter but I think it gets beat by lows
[1:15:37] <%dds333a> @haisho yet another character to not jump in LUL
[1:15:47] <+Bosni9> That's a Ken Masters color pallet
[1:15:58] <%dds333a> OUGI

[1:16:44] <JayEarly> if there was an mk xray that dude’s spine would be dust
[1:16:47] <DaKnightWarrior> DNF is alot of fun. loving Grappler and Inquisitor so far.

[1:22:08] <JayEarly> holy shit
[1:22:09] <JonnyAzzuris_> death hawk is just so cool
[1:22:18] <%cubbywolf> I wonder if crusader is a bad match up here
[1:22:20] <+TopTieramisu> but where's the royal guard character?
[1:22:21] <spawnzie> Guntrip
[1:22:25] <+rasend0ri> But seriously this character looks BUSTED like ruins your game busted
[1:22:27] <madtrixr> how does death hawk work? listen dont worry about it
[1:22:31] <%Rojahh> Sexy stylish > the holy trinity i guess
[1:22:31] <%cubbywolf> crusader seems slower
[1:22:33] <Ardisan_> Crusader could wall him closer
[1:22:39] <%cubbywolf> ah yeah
[1:22:41] <KalmVibrations> Or use dodge
[1:22:46] <President_valentine> The power of the lord isn't a match for the power of gun
[1:22:47] <%cubbywolf> roll
[1:22:48] <Triplicat> there's also universal roll still
[1:22:53] <+Akizea> @rasend0ri vanguard has more range it you'd believe it
[1:22:59] <Retolee> crusader could use his wall or roll or get his armor right
[1:23:01] <Ozmodyas> God the Father the Son. And the Holy Ghost, vs: GUN
[1:23:02] <%cubbywolf> is he reading the chat?
[1:23:03] <+DarkNerdShawny> is he just a cheap zoner character?
[1:23:04] <+kumaprime> stop, stop he's already dead
[1:23:13] <%cubbywolf> aah fps
[1:23:19] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:23:21] <%leith_aziz> @cubbywolf Sometimes. He's busy playing as you can tell
[1:23:24] <didgereedoodah> crusader probably has something to deal with it
[1:23:26] <+Zeroblazex> @rasend0ri vanguard  way worse
[1:23:29] <Invess> @DarkNerdShawny oh I'll show you a zoner

[1:23:57] <thefranchise00> so do you continuously build meter?
[1:23:59] <drefizz> They aren't using crusader's buff enough
[1:24:04] <skewerstar> Checked out the actual DNF/DFO lately and my reaction to the gun toss was "WHAT IS THIS "KOPPS" MALARKEY!"

[1:25:59] <%dds333a> Waldstein too
[1:26:04] <+TopTieramisu> a spitbox, if you will
[1:26:10] <+rasend0ri> Crusader is what the it looks like when you REALLY have the power of God and Anime on your side.
[1:26:11] <+beansoup> this a bibble game?
[1:26:12] <Invess> @TopTieramisu yeah they thought it would lead to ragequitting though
[1:26:13] <%dds333a> and for a BB example, Hazama

[1:26:57] <DeathByPoke7> the god projectile
[1:27:02] <madtrixr> god remember when moonlight tavern was a dungeon
[1:27:03] <Ardisan_> Devil Arm
[1:27:17] <Triplicat> it looks like Es' projectile except it's blood
[1:27:17] <madtrixr> and it was just a giant barfight
[1:27:17] <Arqartur0> Devil trigger
[1:27:19] <madtrixr> good times
[1:27:19] <thefranchise00> this guy does not block
[1:27:23] <darkvergillll> sick
[1:27:29] <spawnzie> I think he's got lifesteal on some moves?
[1:27:29] <%cubbywolf> the wall cornered himself
[1:27:39] <Ardisan_> He is so evil
[1:27:40] <%townzzzzz> HE LOVES IT
[1:27:47] <%cubbywolf> Kid Buu as a berserk hhmab
[1:27:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:27:54] <%cubbywolf> human
[1:27:58] <%dds333a> Dude possessed by the sword
[1:28:03] <JayEarly> I love guys who just love being evil
[1:28:03] <+Ricky_Rexx> is his win quote dissing god?
[1:28:06] <enddword> ASTA BatChest
[1:28:07] <brexdq> This game so hyped
[1:28:07] <+Strahlenwaffeln> wonder what f. Slayer they will put in
[1:28:09] <madtrixr> yeah berserker has just, completely given in to the bloodlust of Kazan, and is now super strong because of it
[1:28:20] <+kumaprime> aww man what happened to my boy Crono?!
[1:28:25] <thefranchise00> anime hammer jesus is p cool
[1:28:27] <Hoarseplay> @madtrixr And then your fight Aganzo for the first time and you shit your pants.
[1:28:37] <madtrixr> @madtrixr Correct
[1:28:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Got Em
[1:28:57] <%dds333a> huge
[1:29:08] <jubejube56> So is that weird arm prep sorta like nightmare where he applies a buff and then can use a couple of super special moves once?
[1:29:08] <AnFace> does doing the motion for any of the ms moves do anything different
[1:29:09] <Dragon_Batman> Didn't even realize he had a dive kcik
[1:29:14] <Dragon_Batman> kick*
[1:29:16] <skewerstar> Wait... is the whole "step on him" disrespect hits thing the thing that led to the foot fetish? LUL
[1:29:17] <%Shad0wTag> good lord i hate facing shinobi
[1:29:19] <BlackermanZX> oh god man has a wall thats cool
[1:29:24] <+BackwardCap> Woolie has to combo his A normals into MP moves OWLSombra
[1:29:29] <JayEarly> is this a TF2 thing where the classes are also characters?
[1:29:36] <madtrixr> yes
[1:29:37] <+texmexorcist> Crusader literally has the powers of God and anime on his side.
[1:29:39] <%MajorCrasher> @jayearly kinda
[1:29:41] <Dragon_Batman> You can
[1:29:44] <%dds333a> @jayearly more or less
[1:29:48] <Dragon_Batman> He gets double hits in normals
[1:29:52] <+Strahlenwaffeln> it goes away when yo are hit and it costs grey life
[1:29:54] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Crusader too OP pls nerf
[1:30:13] <@Menitta> Striker Crusader matchup isnt fun lmao
[1:30:16] <Invess> the vacuum is a great whiff punish
[1:30:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> But who is he crusading against. Have the Dark Elves taken the holy land this time?
[1:30:33] <Triplicat> no invul on supers is such a good decision lol
[1:30:33] <+slayabee> NO invul on supers
[1:30:38] <+kumaprime> supers are mad unsafe
[1:30:38] <darkvergillll> repent sinnner
[1:30:39] <+texmexorcist> DORIME
[1:30:41] <Triplicat> because they're 1 button
[1:30:42] <%leith_aziz> Holy pose
[1:30:47] <madtrixr> nah the dark elves have bigger shit to worry about
[1:31:01] <%Giothegame> Don't forget you get Lifesteal when you're awakened
[1:31:04] <+crubs001> is the game in japanese and korean?
[1:31:05] <Hoarseplay> @sonofthedeepsouth Imposters. Basically, false gods.
[1:31:06] <skewerstar> The lord has deemed you "CRINGE!"
[1:31:17] <%leith_aziz> @sonofthedeepsouth Me who's played the Witcher: I doubt it's the elves' fault
[1:31:18] <@Menitta> you can choose which character speaks what like in SF
[1:31:18] <MOON__MIST> @menitta yeah i saw sonic sol struggling with that MU 😂😭
[1:31:23] <+crubs001> Nice
[1:31:32] <%leith_aziz> @Menitta Oh, nice
[1:31:33] <zecht89> sound of the game seems muffled
[1:31:42] <Triplicat> I'm gonna credit 8ting with that setting being in LUL
[1:31:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> @leith_aziz Around Elves watch yourselves you know
[1:31:56] <%leith_aziz> @zecht89 I think that's on Woolie's  end
[1:32:01] <+Systemic66> crusader is od
[1:32:03] <madtrixr> dont forget the entire buisness with Noire Ferra, I don't know if thats still a thing though
[1:32:07] <+rasend0ri> The seasonburu ha bing a neu charanger
[1:32:10] <gunstars20> Berserker is so fun LUL
[1:32:10] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:32:16] <thefranchise00> this guy just presses all the buttons
[1:32:17] <%dds333a> He's going in
[1:32:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Blockin is for cowards anyway
[1:32:22] <skewerstar> apparently crusader can do hammer loops off the cross wall!
[1:32:23] <Th3rd3> block? what is it? TPFufun
[1:32:23] <Triplicat> MvC3 has per-character voice language setting too
[1:32:26] <MOON__MIST> you can hit confirm into multiple walls
[1:32:29] <zecht89> @zecht89 Yes I know, meant the stream
[1:32:29] <%leith_aziz> oh crap
[1:32:31] <%InvisiblessedReptile> there are many buttons to be pressed
[1:32:31] <+slayabee> So you can hold back to block as well
[1:32:34] <KyberNasse> ONLY FORWARD
[1:32:35] <darkvergillll> RIP
[1:32:37] <primaryfire> it's a fighting game not a blocking game etc
[1:32:38] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The fairest
[1:32:39] <+TopTieramisu> stubby super
[1:32:42] <+MonocleGrizzly> We don’t block in the house of the Lord!
[1:32:43] <Hoarseplay> @madtrixr Yes, but also no? It's weird.
[1:32:52] <Arqartur0> Blocking is for pussies
[1:32:56] <+CaptainPyron> There's no training mode, no time to block. Push EVERYTHING.
[1:32:58] <%townzzzzz> maybe dive kick into super
[1:33:05] <Ardisan_> Man I REALLY cant wait until final release of this game
[1:33:09] <Ardisan_> Looks sooo fun
[1:33:12] <primaryfire> blocking is admitting that you're allowing the opponent to play
[1:33:17] <+Akizea> Commandment 11 thou-shalt-not block thine overhead
[1:33:18] <Hoarseplay> Blocking is for hethans. The Lord will protect me.
[1:33:32] <+MonocleGrizzly> @captainpyron Round 1! FIGHT
[1:33:47] <+TopTieramisu> it's like a super bar that acts like a stamina bar
[1:33:48] <@Menitta> Struggling to find the room
[1:33:49] <@Menitta> lmao
[1:33:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Everybody with the crusader hoodie
[1:33:57] <@Menitta> oh no the beta crashed again
[1:33:57] <jubejube56> so if you have at least 1 MP you can summon a big fiery wheel?
[1:34:02] <Hoarseplay> Less meter, I think.
[1:34:03] <%leith_aziz> I think I better understand how momentum works now. Jumps are heavy and you cant air block, but special moves have LONG range. Interesting compromise
[1:34:04] <JayEarly> you’re only minus if you’re a bitch -Lao Tsu
[1:34:06] <DeathByPoke7> probably mana cost
[1:34:07] <+rasend0ri> The worst designed character
[1:34:09] <madtrixr> its probably less mp consumption
[1:34:12] <Hoot_Patoots> it reduces the cooldown, according to Kizzie
[1:34:18] <+kumaprime> maybe less mp consumption
[1:34:21] <Hoarseplay> That's how it works in DFO proper.
[1:34:22] <madtrixr> thats how it is in DFO
[1:34:27] <+CaptainPyron> @MonocleGrizzly I'm starting with my coolest stronge-*gets hit* OH NO.
[1:34:33] <BlackermanZX> whens Hitman
[1:34:38] <drefizz> Kizzie's crusader is disgusting
[1:34:39] <skewerstar> in the actual game apparently you get a bit of MP refund and lower CD!
[1:34:44] <nmaten> dante?
[1:34:45] <+TopTieramisu> how is punch girl?
[1:34:47] <Retolee> well you select a character before the match either way
[1:34:47] <Carlioo> why are there two dedicated-to-god characters in this game anyway
[1:34:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19

[1:34:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The Crusader needs to be Joshua Graham voice in the dub
[1:35:03] <nintega010> is the room full
[1:35:06] <rich518> what's the lobby name?
[1:35:07] <+CaptainPyron> Because there's gotta be a male and female version of nearly each base character.

[1:36:13] <%stoatacious> yo woolie's getting bodied
[1:36:14] <%dds333a> @jayearly no
[1:36:14] <Ardisan_> If you hit Inquisitor during wheel, does she lose wheel?
[1:36:14] <+CaptainPyron> That wheel makes me happy.
[1:36:14] <%InvisiblessedReptile> fred dursting, commence!

[1:36:47] <darkvergillll> wall vs wheel
[1:36:49] <+QuestJefferson> Inquisitor, you're a loose cannon! Turn in your badge
[1:36:54] <+cgkonnor> The Catholic Church vs the Orthodox Church
[1:36:57] <%leith_aziz> Sometimes Woolie feels like my spiritanimal when he says something like that
[1:36:58] <DaKnightWarrior> The wheel is very slow. you can punish it.
[1:36:59] <+TopTieramisu> the wheel of faith is turn
[1:37:01] <+TopTieramisu> turning*

[1:37:25] <Hoarseplay> @QuestJefferson Basically this. Inquisitor is canonically nuts.
[1:37:26] <%cubbywolf> one has more faith
[1:37:26] <Triplicat> what a lord
[1:37:27] <+vaporousTippler> "My silly bullshit is better than your silly bullshit!"
[1:37:27] <JayEarly> average sigmar fan vs average ulric believer
[1:37:27] <+0neReeler> my god beats your god
[1:37:30] <+Ancopro> God: lol lmao

[1:37:33] <%MajorCrasher> God just wants to see blood lmao
[1:37:34] <@Menitta> God is making bets

[1:37:59] <JayEarly> @madtrixr sick
[1:38:06] <%dds333a> he loses himself in the process
[1:38:09] <+Jrocy247> That wheel is ridiculous
[1:38:10] <Ozmodyas> Yeah, the stage is the body of a giant dragon turtle which was also a living volcano
[1:38:13] <gunstars20> to be fair Inquisitor seems zealous
[1:38:13] <%dds333a> But kinda comes back
[1:38:14] <nintega010> woolies room is shoit of earth
[1:38:16] <+TopTieramisu> throwing out that offensive estus

[1:38:59] <skewerstar> @ozmodyas So basically, they're fighting on Zorah Magdaros!? PogChamp
[1:39:00] <Jayfox82> God can't save you now

[1:39:17] <+FoxLex_> What Woolie's search parameters
[1:39:17] <haisho> that wall was an "I'm not trapped in here with you" moment considering Inquisitor has hotwheels
[1:39:20] <drefizz> Strike of the seven stars!!!
[1:39:22] <@Solidus_113> blessed hammer vs burning axe
[1:39:24] <Retolee> you got sound settings
[1:39:27] <leomuratore> woolieEVIL
[1:39:29] <%mr_sups> Sound mixing in the game is kinda cheecks
[1:39:38] <+tentavision> who made this game?
[1:39:38] <%leith_aziz> Well, it's not Tekken 7 Helipad stage to say the least
[1:39:39] <madtrixr> i remember too much of DFO's bullshit insane lore
[1:39:41] <Hoarseplay> @Guigondi I would pay for a fighting game where the entire premise is that every religion fights over who's god is real.
[1:39:48] <%leith_aziz> If you know, you know
[1:39:50] <+CrowGuy> does this game have universal supers or ifferent inputs per character?
[1:39:54] <@Menitta> I cant get over that wheel
[1:39:58] <+TopTieramisu> isn't there a game where you can play as religious figures?
[1:40:02] <%dds333a> @hoarseplay fight of gods? Kappa
[1:40:09] <jubejube56> So it is me or does conversion sometimes look like it has armour?
[1:40:15] <+TopTieramisu> like jesus fights using the arms of the crucifix like tonfas or something
[1:40:17] <jubejube56> Or maybe armoured moves are canceled into conversion?
[1:40:17] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Fight of Gods I think
[1:40:22] <darkvergillll> JAB
[1:40:26] <FlamingNarwhal> yeah its fight of gods
[1:40:26] <+0neReeler> santa vs jesus
[1:40:27] <KalmVibrations> You can, yes
[1:40:31] <%leith_aziz> @madtrixr I mean, do you like it? As long as I like it, I dont care how insane it gets. That's my experience with GG
[1:40:34] <+kumaprime> god punch
[1:40:36] <DaKnightWarrior> that punch.
[1:40:48] <Hoarseplay> @dds333a Not quite. I want the roster to be all religious fanatics.
[1:40:51] <Ozmodyas> @skewerstar they’re fighting on a Zorah Magdaros, that also had Safi’Jiiva’s energy absorption constantly turned on
[1:40:53] <Ardisan_> God jab
[1:41:01] <MOON__MIST> i think wall is a combo ender/extender
[1:41:03] <GooGuyGG> @CrowGuy It's basically universal inputs for everything. I can DM you the command lists if you want
[1:41:05] <%dds333a> @hoarseplay yes, hence the joke LUL
[1:41:15] <madtrixr> @madtrixr Oh I love it, im just saying that even for KMMOs DFO's plot and world is especially insane

[1:41:50] <Hoarseplay> @dds333a Joke was lost on me, because I was thinking about how I haven't played Fight of Gods in about a year.
[1:41:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:41:53] <Th3rd3> chilling music TPFufun
[1:41:56] <@Menitta> Vanguard also not a fan of
[1:41:56] <+TopTieramisu> have they tried the naruto girl?
[1:41:59] <%MajorCrasher> there is no main character
[1:42:00] <+Akizea> vanguard is the most boring Demonic Lancer class lol
[1:42:00] <BlackermanZX> Theres a lot of god around here
[1:42:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> FIRST RAGE QUIT LETS GOOOOO
[1:42:10] <%dds333a> main character, he says LUL
[1:42:15] <%townzzzzz> they're all main characters
[1:42:19] <+Strahlenwaffeln> Vanguard is funny he does not have magic series but rekas on s and M
[1:42:21] <Guigondi> @Guigondi fight of the gods is indeed as close as it gets to that! But yeah, that concept is cool! father mozgus should definitely be in it!
[1:42:26] <%dds333a> Slayer is the main character of DFO Kappa
[1:42:31] <+TopTieramisu> did someone say functions?
[1:42:34] <yukichocomilk> this game looks sick but i'm too lazy to update my ps4 LUL i'll wait for release
[1:42:37] <Hoarseplay> @madtrixr DFO needs a lorekeeper, because I forgot everything after the second time Arad was rebooted.
[1:42:41] <Ozmodyas> Fun fact: in this setting, Earth exploded and New York City was the only place to survive by being encased in a magic shell and is now floating through space.
[1:42:42] <@Menitta> Hitman is my favorite probably
[1:42:44] <%InvisiblessedReptile> legally distinct dante
[1:42:45] <President_valentine> the other Dante
[1:42:49] <+Checktrap> REGGIE !!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:42:59] <madtrixr> @madtrixr Same, hopefully this game will get some people to at least try and collate that shit
[1:43:02] <Ardisan_> SourPls
[1:43:08] <haisho> to be fair that does sound like Vanguard
[1:43:17] <+Jrocy247> I like how this whole stream no one is even trying the dragon knight or Berserker
[1:43:21] <+Nobuwaroo> that is in fact vangaurd
[1:43:25] <tolloponik> Dante and Vergil fused
[1:43:26] <mrtanaka111> @Ozmodyas now tell me guilty gear lore
[1:43:32] <%mr_sups> God that Engurish gets me every time. It sounds like she's having a stroke
[1:43:39] <+Strahlenwaffeln> 2a>2B>5S>6S>6M!
[1:43:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Jrocy247 was there any kunoichi?
[1:43:44] <Ardisan_> No
[1:43:44] <+Jrocy247> No
[1:43:45] <%dds333a> @mr_sups boy does it LUL
[1:43:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> damn bro
[1:43:54] <%cubbywolf> nuuu
[1:43:57] <%MajorCrasher> @jrocy247 they.played berserker, but they sleep on dragon girl for some reason
[1:44:06] <%leith_aziz> @madtrixr I guess. I usually see someone describing it like that to be considered as "bad". Look at Woolie and Pat's video last night, where you get comments like "only psychopaths enjoy GG lore". Way to indirectly make me feel like shit. Even worse is that he insulted me afterwards pickyPalm
[1:44:07] <+TopTieramisu> dante + kiritsugu
[1:44:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Oh no God power really seems to make a dofference Kappa
[1:44:08] <+rasend0ri> So why is every inquisitor using the same color.
[1:44:13] <@Menitta> its less negative today for sure
[1:44:19] <+DudeTheMoose> Etnad
[1:44:20] <+Strahlenwaffeln> and 2 S is a god neutral button
[1:44:22] <%cubbywolf> I gotta do so much work let me procrastinate more
[1:44:22] <Ozmodyas> Fun fact: that magic circle in the background is actually holding up an entire ocean.
[1:44:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Blue is a nice color
[1:44:26] <theredfox930000> kof time
[1:44:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> guess everyone is feeling the wheel, the jesus and the ryu
[1:44:31] <Ardisan_> Blue is for normies
[1:44:41] <KyberNasse> speeeen
[1:44:42] <%leith_aziz> I have a hard time enjoying what I like unless people validate my likes. Im weird
[1:44:44] <huskarl_zap> the intro is nachoneko asking for the tourist information booth
[1:44:46] <mrtanaka111> lame berserk enjoyers
[1:44:46] <@Menitta> god hitman is so cool
[1:45:00] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz Pat likes fighting games, he's just not interested in the lore of some of them, actually, most of them LUL
[1:45:04] <Hoarseplay> @leith_aziz Sounds like you should work on that my dude.
[1:45:07] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[1:45:13] <Ardisan_> @dds333a ALl
[1:45:15] <+Strahlenwaffeln> 2B is the best whiffpunish on hitman^^
[1:45:16] <madtrixr> @madtrixr I can feel that, I suppose, for me its at least a thing where like, no one really even KNOWS what DFO lore is so they cant get mad at me for caring
[1:45:17] <%leith_aziz> Hitman is badass. Makes me think of Dante but more focused on the "Demon Hunter" aspect
[1:45:27] <mrtanaka111> @leith_aziz thats on you to fix
[1:45:27] <+TopTieramisu> didn't pat swear off fighting games?
[1:45:27] <+yeknomlive> striker is super fun but in a world with fullscreen normals you get get slapped sometimes
[1:45:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Guilty to thw pyre woth you
[1:45:32] <madtrixr> but it sucks that people would say shit like that
[1:45:34] <%KennyKRool> Ranger is where it's at. he has a rainstorm
[1:45:35] <+rasend0ri> Parry this you filthy casual
[1:45:38] <Bloodhit> It's just me or bitrate is eating ass in gameplay?
[1:45:52] <%MajorCrasher> yeah it is
[1:45:52] <%leith_aziz> @dds333a That's completely fine. Im just talking about the comment section of last night's SCB's video
[1:46:01] <$tkuwari> wassap lads
[1:46:04] <%dds333a> @toptieramisu he definitely doesn't play them as much as he used to, but he played strive
[1:46:11] <%leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu I think he's just frustrated with teh games he plays not getting rollback
[1:46:13] <+TopTieramisu> fighting game lore is like plot in porn
[1:46:19] <%dds333a> he bodied woolz that one time LUL LUL
[1:46:19] <+TopTieramisu> it exists but who cares
[1:46:22] <+SaurianCrash> each character has their on op move here and there
[1:46:23] <SethYuikora> Inquisitor still throwing jars of spooge I see
[1:46:23] <%leith_aziz> It turned him off of them
[1:46:25] <%Giothegame> I love how twitch bitrate can't handle the fire wheel
[1:46:27] <+Akizea> @toptieramisu
[1:46:31] <didgereedoodah> I feel like this inquisitor isn't using wheel enough
[1:46:36] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a he's too ma at virtua fighter to want to play other fighting games
[1:46:39] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[1:46:56] <+Akizea> @toptieramisu good thing this wasn't a fighting game first then huh?
[1:47:06] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag surely you mean DOA Kappa
[1:47:09] <+TopTieramisu> @Akizea i just mean in general
[1:47:16] <+FadingFrost> are they playing each other
[1:47:24] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a if i was to take a petty shot at pat yes i defintely meant doa
[1:47:28] <%MajorCrasher> no online
[1:47:28] <%Shad0wTag> @FadingFrost no
[1:47:36] <darkvergillll> zaddy
[1:47:38] <%Major_Lee_> Servers working better now?
[1:47:43] <%leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu You say that man, but there's some fighting games I've abandonded specifically for certain plot elements. Ever heard of 4th Snake?
[1:47:43] <+FadingFrost> gotcha who's playing?
[1:47:47] <%RealThiele> This is Thancred.
[1:47:51] <SethYuikora> comeback mechanics seem just a bit too strong, but I'm digging the game overall
[1:47:52] <%Shad0wTag> @Major_Lee_ yeah but its still not great
[1:47:52] <haisho> I wish it was Troubleshooter or Specialist though
[1:47:59] <+TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz don't think so?
[1:48:01] <madtrixr> i mean to be fair, it feels that way with dfo stuff sometimes, they just throw some darts at words on a board and go "alright thats the new zone for 10-15 levels"
[1:48:03] <+Akizea> honestly I wish it was secret agent fr
[1:48:08] <+SaurianCrash> he just looks like the mc from reborn goat assassin
[1:48:14] <+FadingFrost> I've seen people set up two ps4s in the same room to play each other
[1:48:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @FadingFrost Reggie at the moment
[1:48:23] <Hoarseplay> @haisho Troubleshooter would've been hilarious.
[1:48:34] <+Dova573> He looks like he has a sassy kid to protect  that he cares about but wont admit
[1:48:36] <@Menitta> that move where he throws the sword out
[1:48:39] <Ozmodyas> Troubleshooter is literally just Punished “Venom” Snake if he decided to stop sneaking around and blow everything up
[1:48:39] <+Akizea> I HIGHKEY wish they picked a different Demonic Lancer class. vanguard is his lamest one lol
[1:48:39] <@Menitta> is so fucking cool
[1:48:41] <madtrixr> i would have screamed if it was troubleshooter
[1:48:41] <mrtanaka111> is hp higher than normal in this game?
[1:48:44] <CruxAustralis> are they playing against each other?
[1:48:49] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:48:50] <darkvergillll> LUL
[1:48:52] <madtrixr> people would be so mad about the shotgun
[1:48:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:48:56] <haisho> I want Troubleshooter and his dumb Claymore
[1:49:03] <huskarl_zap> @cruxaustralis no
[1:49:04] <%Giothegame> Woolie found the Awakening passive move
[1:49:07] <CruxAustralis> tyty
[1:49:13] <+FadingFrost> this game is mad fun
[1:49:17] <+SaurianCrash> guys each gender can class type is in this right? like 1 to 1 for each ?
[1:49:20] <+TopTieramisu> troubleshooter? is he a giant paperclip?
[1:49:27] <+SaurianCrash> and class*
[1:49:28] <darkvergillll> LUL
[1:49:30] <%Shad0wTag> @SaurianCrash they have different classes based on gender
[1:49:30] <+Akizea> @sauriancrash no
[1:49:32] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[1:49:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> EAT IT
[1:49:38] <%dds333a> @sauriancrash almost
[1:49:38] <%MajorCrasher> @sauriancrash classes are gender locked
[1:49:42] <+CaptainPyron> I really wish there was a training room, but oh well. Kinda fun smashing my face against things to get the idea of what's happening.
[1:49:43] <%cubbywolf> reggie isn't learning but his muscles are
[1:49:46] <madtrixr> is it troubleshooters second awakening thats "i planted all of these explosives ahead of time you idiot, you fool"
[1:49:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wheeled
[1:49:55] <BlackermanZX> DAMN
[1:49:55] <%dds333a> There are some genders that only get that one
[1:49:58] <+Akizea> the only classes there's Male and female version of are fighter, slayer, and mage
[1:49:59] <+TopTieramisu> get joan of arc'd
[1:50:00] <DaKnightWarrior> SeemsGood
[1:50:01] <T_Sasquatch> is there any basic guide to what to do because ive no idea what all this mp and conversion shit means
[1:50:01] <SethYuikora> 50% combo
[1:50:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BURN
[1:50:05] <+Akizea> and gunner*
[1:50:07] <President_valentine> Butn the heretic
[1:50:08] <+SaurianCrash> i mean like m/f versions in this atm
[1:50:13] <darkvergillll> gatted
[1:50:21] <%Giothegame> Time for BBCF?
[1:50:22] <%MajorCrasher> I mean even then the opposite gender class usually plays completely differently
[1:50:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[1:50:25] <+SaurianCrash> like f/m fighter class tyypes
[1:50:26] <%KennyKRool> Grappler mains represent
[1:50:27] <%cubbywolf> wheel needs half the time cut LUL
[1:50:29] <xxHungryxx> 🔥🔥🔥
[1:50:32] <+0neReeler> wheel goes turn
[1:50:35] <+kumaprime> you shot her toes
[1:50:42] <darkvergillll> EVERYONE WOULD
[1:50:42] <%cubbywolf> T R A I N I N G
[1:50:44] <%Shad0wTag> @T_Sasquatch youtube offical DNF Duel for short explanatons
[1:50:46] <Hoarseplay> @madtrixr Yes, but also "watch me hit this sick ramp on my motorbike away from the explosion"
[1:50:46] <madtrixr> also depending on when they were introduced, the male and female classes are either basically the same or radically different
[1:50:46] <darkvergillll> OR A LOCAL MODE?
[1:50:46] <%mr_sups> Or a Versus
[1:50:50] <%Major_Lee_> I would like a command list
[1:50:53] <pixel_river> this is what i wanted from strives libbiy, looks wise
[1:50:56] <+CaptainPyron> Training mode would help me like crazy. lol I have no idea what does what yet.
[1:50:57] <%cubbywolf> when does the beta end?
[1:50:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YOU LEARN WITH EXPERIENCE Kappa
[1:50:58] <%Juriasu> time for BROTHERRR
[1:50:58] <yukichocomilk> I'll buy this game for sure
[1:50:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh boy, time for BB
[1:51:00] <+crybirb> It's an online test so why would they put a training mode?
[1:51:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Kunoichi and Ranger are definitely gonna be my mains
[1:51:02] <gunstars20> Ah shit
[1:51:03] <pixel_river> lobby*
[1:51:04] <T_Sasquatch> @Shad0wTag thanks
[1:51:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pain is the best Teacher Kappa
[1:51:10] <Dragon_Batman> Was fun to watch
[1:51:10] <%cubbywolf> PUT IN ANOTHER QUARTER
[1:51:11] <@Menitta> The lack of command list is actually a reference to Skullgirls Kappa
[1:51:14] <xxHungryxx> Crusader
[1:51:15] <%dds333a> ONIISAN
[1:51:22] <mrtanaka111> i wish granblue wasnt dead
[1:51:24] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta OH MY GOD I FORGOT THAT
[1:51:29] <+Mrbaconator> EVERYONE is bullshit it's GREAT
[1:51:34] <T_Sasquatch> @crybirb because potential buyers matter and this is their first impression on the game
[1:51:34] <+kumaprime> ooh, they're gonna play BB
[1:51:36] <%Shad0wTag> @mrtanaka111 pray it gets rollback one day
[1:51:49] <mrtanaka111> @mrtanaka111 it will still be dead
[1:52:02] <@Menitta> I'd pick up granblue again if it had rollback
[1:52:04] <+crybirb> @T_Sasquatch It's clearly stated as an online test. This is not a demo to attract buyers. Having a training mode would diminish their chances to have factual and important data to optimize network. Nah.
[1:52:05] <+Mrbaconator> if granblue was a playable video game lul
[1:52:07] <OldManDeckardCain> the no meter special button is more like a heavy or a drive from blazblue
[1:52:16] <fcKurl> i like what i tried of this alot so far i dont know what is going on really tho
[1:52:24] <kikosmore> What are they switching to?
[1:52:25] <yukichocomilk> I"d 100% go back to granblue if it got rollback. just look how blazblue was revived
[1:52:30] <%KennyKRool> This game is sick!
[1:52:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Maaaaan, I miss playing Vaseraga
[1:52:33] <@Menitta> The symbol won't change if they're rematching back and forth btw
[1:52:36] <theredfox930000> grandblue netcode is ass
[1:52:37] <+FadingEmber> no cap this need a For Glory mode
[1:52:41] <+Akizea> it's prolly fair to assume all of arcsys' games will have rollback now
[1:52:43] <kikosmore> @AlteisenReiseZ He was so fun!
[1:52:44] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus do you think this game will be free to play?
[1:52:44] <%Major_Lee_> I've had granblue still on ps4 in the hopes of rollback
[1:52:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Granblue deserved better NotLikeThis
[1:52:47] <+kumaprime> yeah, granblue was fun
[1:52:53] <+SaurianCrash> nah i wont be i bet
[1:52:57] <mrtanaka111> pour one for ladiva
[1:53:04] <mrtanaka111> best grappler
[1:53:06] <DaKnightWarrior> Granblue is great.
[1:53:07] <Ardisan_> If this game doesnt have Beat Em Up singleplayer mode then thats a huge missed opportunity
[1:53:18] <MOON__MIST> gotta figure out how to get in with grappler
[1:53:18] <%dds333a> somewhat
[1:53:19] <Dragon_Batman> Man that would be dope
[1:53:24] <+crybirb> @Ardisan_ Like that weird Tekken mode, it would be great for sure.
[1:53:25] <%dds333a> They have backstory
[1:53:25] <gunstars20> They have pre established lore for classes
[1:53:25] <+Akizea> somewhat yeah they do
[1:53:27] <+Strahlenwaffeln> they have a individual story for each base class
[1:53:30] <MOON__MIST> also why is there no dash button 😭
[1:53:33] <+Mrbaconator> man i can't wait to shell out my money for the premium grappler skin in the hoody and long hair
[1:53:36] <theredfox930000> reggie is fighting games
[1:53:36] <xxHungryxx> Grappler should of had a wheel throw 😏
[1:53:38] <mrtanaka111> real question, is grappler a grappler?
[1:53:39] <%Major_Lee_> I tried DFO but I hate that i need xpadder to use a controller
[1:53:48] <+kumaprime> Reggie the Hero
[1:53:48] <huskarl_zap> GOD IS FIGHTING GAMES
[1:53:52] <+Akizea> dfo character art is SO fucking sick. I'm waiting for more classes to get added to this honestly. I wanna see how they're gonna handle them
[1:53:53] <%MajorCrasher> @ardisan_ that's what the original game is for lol
[1:53:53] <%leith_aziz> @leith_aziz He critises NRS games a lot, mostly about the story stuff. I actually started fighting games with MK, but he turned me off of NRS because I ended up agreeing with most of his points, and the guy is popular. 1M views popular. Basically, after his MK11 critique, I moved on to other fighting games, and that's how I discovered Tekken and then Guilty Gear. Sorry if this seems like a tangent, just wanted to explain.
[1:53:54] <nintega010> Grappler is my boy
[1:54:02] <%leith_aziz> oof, sorry that couldnt be shorter
[1:54:06] <VJdarkworld> seiba
[1:54:11] <+Strahlenwaffeln> @Major_Lee_ there are steam presets with steam controller support
[1:54:12] <haisho> in this case it's because MMO
[1:54:17] <Ardisan_> @MajorCrasher No, give me more
[1:54:18] <%dds333a> only at least they have names LUL
[1:54:19] <OldManDeckardCain> except in fate they do have actual names as well LUL
[1:54:32] <@Menitta> I'm super excited for the full release
[1:54:34] <xxHungryxx> That she'll though 🤘
[1:54:50] <%Major_Lee_> @Major_Lee_ didn't even know it was on steam. just downloaded the client
[1:54:52] <%leith_aziz> @leith_aziz So I guess im a weird guy where I look for story in any games I play, even fighting games.
[1:54:59] <OldManDeckardCain> I wish dfo went the f2p route, it could have a better success that way
[1:55:08] <+SaurianCrash> which one was super cute sword n shield class on dfo?
[1:55:09] <+Akizea> @leith_aziz story in games is fun. especially fighting games
[1:55:17] <Ardisan_> Dont play DFO on stream. Has issues on there. Recommend to just use the original game client
[1:55:20] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Nah man I feel you, I was lured into GG by the story as well
[1:55:23] <Ardisan_> steam*
[1:55:24] <Zourath> @OldManDeckardCain DFO was never not F2P.
[1:55:26] <GeltonZ> @SaurianCrash Knight. So Dragon Knight in DNF Duel
[1:55:29] <@Menitta> Oh wow
[1:55:29] <theredfox930000> how does this game smells
[1:55:31] <%MajorCrasher> it used the be f2p but changed after the reboot @oldmandeckardcain
[1:55:32] <@Menitta> thats faithful
[1:55:37] <madtrixr> yeah its dead fucking on
[1:55:41] <DaKnightWarrior> SeemsGood
[1:55:42] <%dds333a> sure is
[1:55:43] <OldManDeckardCain> I meant the fighting game

[1:56:30] <haisho> mostly PVE but there's PVP too
[1:56:30] <GeltonZ> That was PvP yeah. They hold PvP tournaments
[1:56:30] <%Major_Lee_> If they dont have skins in duel they're missing out
[1:56:31] <+Akizea> there is pvp yes
[1:56:32] <@Menitta> I bet fans of DFO were super hype to see that kind of stuff in Arc Sys fidelity
[1:56:35] <+FlyingRamen> There was pve and pvp

[2:05:02] <%Rojahh> @dds333a Lmao
[2:05:04] <gryffinp> Active flow *is* complicated
[2:05:04] <%townzzzzz> it's just an attack buff
[2:05:09] <%cubbywolf> it happens
[2:05:13] <%Sparkseid> sajamVibe
[2:05:17] <@Menitta> the game literally went "Dont worry about it"
[2:05:20] <gryffinp> It's basically positive bonus from GGStrive except without the wall break part
[2:05:21] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:05:24] <%cubbywolf> ehhhh blaze blue
[2:05:29] <TigerClaws12> Uber Pedro over LUL
[2:05:30] <+Complete_Phased> @WoolieVersus have you gotten a chance to check out DNF Duel?
[2:05:30] <didgereedoodah> it's positive bonus basically
[2:05:31] <aftertone> its a buff that happens when you play the game thats all i know
[2:05:32] <%cubbywolf> what
[2:05:34] <Ardisan_> Blah Bloo
[2:05:40] <@Menitta> @Complete_Phased they just finished DNF
[2:05:40] <%dds333a> Izayoi I don't know SHIT about
[2:05:41] <Ardisan_> Central Friction

[2:06:10] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:06:11] <%cubbywolf> landing an exceed axle will start active flow. I UNDERSTAND YES I DO I SWEAR
[2:06:12] <gryffinp> speen
[2:06:17] <%andrewofbob> Exceed Excel does more damage if you're in active flow
[2:06:19] <blackkanye> It's complicated Kappa
[2:06:20] <+Tevvy> its positive bonus! thats it!
[2:06:20] <%dds333a> @menitta LUL
[2:06:30] <DeathByPoke7> so its like a stun bar but  a buff
[2:06:34] <kikosmore> Izayoi? :)
[2:06:38] <nintega010> Blazeblue is complicated depending on the character
[2:06:44] <aftertone> they werent wrong when they said its complicated yknow
[2:06:51] <didgereedoodah> makes your burst come back faster, damage bonus and makes Exceed Accel do double damage
[2:06:51] <huskarl_zap> RABID RABID RABID ACTIVE FLO
[2:07:02] <gryffinp> Only against some attacks
[2:07:03] <+rbakervv> man. this game is not good for the bitrate
[2:07:09] <%baronblank> as someone who has played since CT but stopped partway through the third one, wow I don't know what those terms are lmao
[2:07:19] <%andrewofbob> Everything on the ground is AA
[2:07:21] <%townzzzzz> use that meter
[2:07:28] <%dds333a> Another Grim Reaper Kappa
[2:07:42] <SunsetJack> You can't hold the D button. Any button but D will tech.
[2:07:44] <gryffinp> I really need to pick up Kagura just so I can understand what all of his bullshit is
[2:07:53] <%leith_aziz> Hi again chat. Was busy for a moment pickyWave
[2:07:54] <%dds333a> oh no, stance character too
[2:07:55] <+the22cstomp> @gryffinp stance and charge character
[2:07:56] <nutimik> I love Kagura's stance mechanic, I wish GG had a character like him
[2:08:01] <didgereedoodah> neutral tech is the only fully invuln one
[2:08:01] <%Moonblade92> i remember hating Kagura so much as Nu/Lambda
[2:08:13] <huskarl_zap> woom woom wom
[2:08:14] <%dds333a> He's charge too, damn
[2:08:16] <ChoculaUltra> imagine how a new Blazblue would look with the Strive engine/style monkaS
[2:08:18] <%townzzzzz> all that meter not used
[2:08:19] <%Major_Lee_> omg all these meters
[2:08:22] <@Menitta> is it me or is there some screen tearing
[2:08:25] <%Moonblade92> with his charge plowing trough projectiles like they din't exisr
[2:08:31] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:08:35] <gryffinp> if we ever get a new blazblue I kind of want it to be pixel sprites
[2:08:35] <aftertone> when THEY are on 30%
[2:08:42] <+the22cstomp> he also has a command grab off stance
[2:08:45] <ChoculaUltra> yeah, saw some tearing at the bottom even during the opening movie
[2:08:46] <%Moonblade92> also Kagura is the only charge chara in BB iirc
[2:08:48] <%dds333a> oh, that was Tsubaki, I see it
[2:08:52] <%Rojahh> closest thing i fell like can compare Kagura is like tusk from KI and even then IDK
[2:08:53] <%andrewofbob> Tager's grab super technically does more damage than his instant kill
[2:08:56] <+the22cstomp> if i remember correctly 5D~B is it
[2:08:57] <%dds333a> the hell happened to her? LUL
[2:09:15] <%dds333a> she used to play completely different, with the book and shit
[2:09:20] <AverageHanzo> it's complicated Kappa
[2:09:22] <gryffinp> She got taken over by her living weapon
[2:09:25] <+Meathands> 720 is the ultimate disrespect
[2:09:28] <%Moonblade92> its a diff version you still got the book ine
[2:09:29] <gryffinp> normal tsubaki is still playable though
[2:09:33] <mothdude> She got a super weapon and now is a gundam.
[2:09:33] <%Moonblade92> that chains specials
[2:09:34] <BlackermanZX> iirc theres regular tsubaki and then theres izayoi
[2:09:35] <+Axle13j> Magic book happened LUL
[2:09:35] <@Menitta> isnt Izayoi the same character as that imperial guard lookin girl?
[2:09:36] <%Mathochism> It blows my mind that Woolie isn't 100% a Bullet main.
[2:09:43] <%leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra I see BB fans talk about loving that, but they're also kinda bitching about not wanting a new one because it'll be "simplified". Kinda of a diehard mentality, but I dont know
[2:09:44] <%dds333a> @angryasian5 ayy, that was a plot point, neat
[2:09:46] <nintega010> @menitta yes
[2:09:49] <%andrewofbob> @dds333a It's a the same person with a different moveset, like Noel/mu
[2:09:56] <nutimik> I think he tried bullet before but her gameplay didn't really grab him. same happened to me
[2:09:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:09:58] <+the22cstomp> kagura is just cool enough to override punch characters
[2:10:03] <aftertone> @Menitta yes. Izayoi has the unit thing activated
[2:10:09] <huskarl_zap> I prefer RABID to active flow
[2:10:15] <Carlioo> how many systems can YOU put in a fighting game
[2:10:21] <%dds333a> @andrewofbob and lambda I see
[2:10:23] <+Mrbaconator> oh wow that ladies voice saying counter is not good
[2:10:27] <+Mrbaconator> oh wow that's bad
[2:10:28] <%townzzzzz> come reggie use the trans AM
[2:10:28] <%trackles_64> @Carlioo yes
[2:10:28] <gryffinp> speen
[2:10:35] <%andrewofbob> There are 2 Tsubakis, 2 Jins, 3 or 4 Terumis, and 4 Noels
[2:11:03] <didgereedoodah> there are only 3 terumis, but arguably 5 noels
[2:11:04] <%dds333a> @andrewofbob how many sisters among them? LUL
[2:11:06] <+the22cstomp> @Mrbaconator in what way exactly
[2:11:07] <mothdude> Does Izayoi count as a Noel?
[2:11:15] <+TopTieramisu> man this BG is busy
[2:11:16] <ChoculaUltra> @leith_aziz ah I can see that amongst the diehards. I can see them "simplifying" a new Blazblue to get a fresher audience. Wouldn't be too terrible, imo!
[2:11:17] <+Mrbaconator> @the22cstomp it's really annoying
[2:11:18] <@Menitta> wait how many Noels??
[2:11:18] <mothdude> Sorry, I meant Izanami.
[2:11:18] <gryffinp> no, izayoi is a tsubaki

[2:11:27] <aftertone> @dds333a 4 "sisters" of ragna, 2 brothers
[2:11:29] <Carlioo> @andrewofbob are you sure you didn't miss anyone?
[2:11:37] <+the22cstomp> i mean you can change the system voice to a different character if it annoys you 🤷
[2:11:38] <%andrewofbob> Is there a 5th Noel?
[2:11:41] <AverageHanzo> Well.. technically it's not 4 Noels but 4 Sayas LUL
[2:11:41] <Vashido22> @menitta well there' Noel, Nu, Lamnda, Mu
[2:11:52] <Vashido22> and you can KINDA count izanami
[2:11:55] <didgereedoodah> Noel, Mu, Nu, Lambda, and Izanami
[2:11:56] <+Mrbaconator> @the22cstomp but at the same time her tone at the end of words has a slight metal slug announcer quality like rocket lawnchair
[2:11:58] <@Menitta> Nu 13 is also a Noel?
[2:12:01] <gryffinp> I count izanami
[2:12:01] <ChoculaUltra> alright chat - what has the crazier lore, GG or BB
[2:12:03] <AverageHanzo> or 5 Sayas if you count Noel and Mu separately
[2:12:09] <DDDorsett> BB
[2:12:11] <@Menitta> with a bullet, Blazblue
[2:12:14] <%dds333a> @choculaultra oh god LUL
[2:12:18] <Vashido22> they're all clones of saya so
[2:12:21] <Vashido22> yeah
[2:12:24] <BlackermanZX> @ChoculaUltra dear god its blazblue
[2:12:26] <gryffinp> @ChoculaUltra guilty gear has WEIRDER lore, but BB is harder to understand with overlapping timelines alternate universes and time travel
[2:12:28] <didgereedoodah> BB is just GG mixed with FATE
[2:12:30] <Carlioo> @ChoculaUltra BB has a character called Embryo System, BB wins
[2:12:32] <%andrewofbob> @Menitta In BBCT, Nu and Noel are both like "there can be only one"
[2:12:35] <%dds333a> I'm behind on BB lore too
[2:12:37] <+TopTieramisu> isn't sol badguy's gf 5+ different characters?
[2:12:37] <aftertone> @Menitta noel nu lambda and izanami are clones of ragnas younger sister Saya
[2:12:37] <+spardanwarrior> BB has time loops, so it wins by default
[2:12:42] <DDDorsett> BB's lore makes no sense without making you lose your mind
[2:12:48] <%leith_aziz> The sprite quality is pretty great. Allthough I usually prefer 3D models because it gives way for more dynamic camera opportunities. Arcsys tends to make the best of both worlds with their more recent presentation
[2:13:02] <BlackermanZX> BB's time shenanigans makes it hard to follow
[2:13:05] <@Menitta> I remember playing Blazblue on Vita and doing the story mode
[2:13:05] <Th3rd3> @TopTieramisu not really
[2:13:06] <yeahthatalex> BB also has side manga characters that no one in the west heard of playable in this game.
[2:13:08] <ChoculaUltra> I legit stopped following the lore after Continuum Shift so everything is wild to me LUL
[2:13:11] <@Menitta> I was losing my 15 year old mind
[2:13:11] <%townzzzzz> BB's story happens cus susan got so bored guarding the god unit he ghosted out of his body and humans found it
[2:13:18] <%leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra I'll say it straight. I like GG lore, a lot. I know nothing about BB
[2:13:18] <Vashido22> bb lore is weird, but you cant tell me Hakumen being Jin isnt the sickest shit
[2:13:19] <@Menitta> I had no fucking clue what was going on lmao
[2:13:23] <%andrewofbob> Also, Makoto just wonders into a parallel timeline, so feel free to double everything
[2:13:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> when you live in the active flow you forget such measly things as "fireball"
[2:13:50] <TigerClaws12> yea don't block her projectiles LUL
[2:13:59] <+Strahlenwaffeln> I like Izayoi but playing her kills my hands on hitbox^^
[2:14:02] <gryffinp> I gotta say, playing blazblue again after playing Strive has really made me go "God damn they really DID dumb things down, I missed this shit"
[2:14:04] <ChoculaUltra> @Menitta I think the first BB's story mode was the first VN-esque experience I had - blew my fucking mind with all the story trees LUL
[2:14:17] <aftertone> Nah. BB time stuff is rather easy. The world just resets the clock wheng things go too bad. Thats it. The way powers and systems work. Thats the hard part.
[2:14:20] <%dds333a> Damn, I haven't played this series in so damn long, and all this shit has happened LUL
[2:14:25] <@Menitta> I think it was the 2nd one I played
[2:14:31] <%andrewofbob> Gag reels in story mode were a riot
[2:14:32] <+TopTieramisu> LMAOOOO
[2:14:34] <+TopTieramisu> what a comeback
[2:14:36] <nutimik> magic pixel
[2:14:36] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:14:42] <TigerClaws12> she's a gundumb
[2:14:45] <%townzzzzz> TP in place
[2:14:45] <%dds333a> we take those
[2:14:46] <gryffinp> I think that like 2/3 of the cast can teleport one way or another
[2:14:49] <%leith_aziz> @gryffinp Eh, I've played SFV and MK11. Strive does not give me the same feeling
[2:14:51] <didgereedoodah> Gain Arts Izayoi is the wildest character
[2:14:55] <@Menitta> Continuum Shift thats what the game was fucking called LUL
[2:14:57] <Zerotoad5> Izayoi has like teleports and stance cancels she's nuts
[2:15:01] <aftertone> Izayoi has instant teleports  yeah
[2:15:15] <%dds333a> @menitta last I played was Extend LUL
[2:15:48] <%dds333a> jab resets Kapparesets
[2:15:55] <@Menitta> I will say, having at least touched all the Blazblues, I found Central Fiction to feel the best. Idk what's different but its a lot less stiff from what I remember
[2:16:10] <BlackermanZX> Kagura is pretty fun
[2:16:20] <didgereedoodah> yo Reggie got those stock combos
[2:16:37] <aftertone> I play Mai the most. Super free form wife
[2:16:43] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[2:16:46] <%dds333a> LUL

[2:17:06] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:17:08] <mothdude> The only thing about Blazblue's lore you need to know is that Nine fucked a cat.
[2:17:21] <%leith_aziz> At the end of the day, I have no room to talk about BB lore because I like GG lore a lot. Going on the offense would make me hypocrite
[2:17:22] <TanyaSaberFace> @mothdude ^
[2:17:24] <%dds333a> @mothdude isn't homegirl playable too LUL
[2:17:33] <%dds333a> like, finally
[2:17:36] <gryffinp> Nine is playable and Jubei is dlc
[2:17:50] <DDDorsett> TBH, GG lore is more interesting
[2:18:00] <@Menitta> GG lore is way more interesting
[2:18:03] <@Menitta> imo
[2:18:04] <%dds333a> Is Nine as OP as the lore promised?
[2:18:06] <aftertone> @leith_aziz I feel the exact same way the other way around. BB to GG
[2:18:10] <Josef_Stryker> Is Astral Finishes mainly for flexing?
[2:18:13] <Zerotoad5> NIne is very good
[2:18:13] <%Shad0wTag> Personally BB has too much time travel for me to really enjoy it
[2:18:13] <%leith_aziz> Maybe, I just want to respect both communities
[2:18:14] <yeahthatalex> GG lore is stupid and confusing
[2:18:15] <gryffinp> if you've ever played Dota, Nine is Invoker
[2:18:15] <aftertone> @dds333a yes
[2:18:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Astrals are for flexing, yeah
[2:18:31] <%dds333a> @josef_stryker for me, they were LUL
[2:18:33] <%andrewofbob> There are a handful of confirms into astral
[2:18:42] <%dds333a> @aftertone oh shit
[2:18:50] <aftertone> @Josef_Stryker Yes. you can combo into them from grabs and wall splats
[2:18:50] <BlackermanZX> astral is useful but usually its for flexing LUL
[2:18:58] <AverageHanzo> GG lore is easier to follow, but I hate how it's story mode in Xrd and Strive is structured in basically making all characters just exposition dumps
[2:19:06] <gryffinp> Some character can combo into astral reasonably well but usually they have combos that can spend a hundred meter and kill anyway. But on the other hands, sometimes the SIMPLEST combo is quick confirm into astral
[2:19:12] <nintega010> when you want the eazy life choice azrael
[2:19:13] <didgereedoodah> astral is optimal if you have it. Very easy to combo into
[2:19:21] <%dds333a> I know Bang was (?) comboable
[2:19:32] <%dds333a> maybe still is
[2:19:36] <%leith_aziz> I've watched a let's play of KH, and I mean ALL games. So I found GG a cakewalk in comparison. I'll leave it at that
[2:19:37] <yeahthatalex> Bang also sucks
[2:19:39] <%andrewofbob> Fuck the into for Bang's astral, though
[2:19:39] <aftertone> I usually been Astraling with Mai cause she can instantly combo off it from a grab
[2:19:41] <gryffinp> I wanna say that astrals in general got easier to combo to in centralfiction
[2:19:45] <%andrewofbob> input*
[2:19:46] <AverageHanzo> BB is a clusterfuck but the story is kinda made by the characters
[2:20:05] <gryffinp> @WoolieVersus "Attention!" means you're about to get Active Flow
[2:20:07] <%dds333a> @yeahthatalex he always kinda did, no?

[2:20:16] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:20:17] <%leith_aziz> @AverageHanzo I didn't really get that feeling in Strive if im honest. It was structured much better imo

[2:21:06] <%leith_aziz> pickyFocus
[2:21:15] <Vashido22> @averagehanzo yeah BB characters grew on me a lot
[2:21:18] <AverageHanzo> @leith_aziz Strive is actually the one I felt it the worst. Like I can't really pinpoint any of the characters there, other than like Sol and Jack-O
[2:21:22] <aftertone> Mai: Grab into Astral is a great way of demoralizing your opponent
[2:21:25] <huskarl_zap> needs more rabid
[2:21:25] <mothdude> @AverageHanzo I can agree with that. I only understood about 50% of what happened in the story mode but it sure did get me invested in the characters.
[2:21:25] <didgereedoodah> never stop charging flashkick
[2:21:32] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:21:35] <Vashido22> I fucking love Ragna, dude just has bad luck
[2:21:42] <yeahthatalex> How did DNF go?
[2:21:42] <gryffinp> ragna is the best
[2:21:49] <aftertone> Ragna is THE BEST
[2:21:50] <Vashido22> How GG characters treat Sol: Damn Sol you're so cool and strong. How BB characters treat ragna: you fucking piece of shit
[2:21:57] <%dds333a> @vashido22 imagine being screwed by reality LUL
[2:22:01] <Vashido22> give my man a  break
[2:22:02] <%leith_aziz> @AverageHanzo That's actually a good thing. It's centered around Sol. You dont wanna include everyone
[2:22:12] <Texeu> Is this on PC or Console?
[2:22:13] <+TopTieramisu> ragna is the idiot sandwich?
[2:22:30] <aftertone> Ragna gets done dirty by everyone
[2:22:43] <Vashido22> like by EVERYONE
[2:22:47] <Vashido22> except celica
[2:22:49] <%leith_aziz> Sol is my favorite protagonsit, but man I feel bad for Ragna. Not saying as in they didnt do him justice, but the man cant get a break
[2:22:50] <didgereedoodah> Ragna gets done dirty by literal god
[2:23:02] <+MisterRockett> Did anyone play Nine yet? I need to see them start labbing Nine.
[2:23:08] <%dds333a> Both Sol and Ragna is suffering LUL
[2:23:22] <Dragon_Batman> Time to go get me some water
[2:23:23] <@Menitta> this is on PC. They're playing to do the Rollback netcode
[2:23:26] <Vashido22> Sol got his wife back in his last game
[2:23:33] <Vashido22> meanwhile ragna...lmao
[2:23:39] <+MisterRockett> Ragna got his sister
[2:23:44] <%townzzzzz> sol got the better ending LUL
[2:23:45] <Texeu> @Menitta Ty!
[2:23:48] <AverageHanzo> well... Ragna got his sister back Kappa
[2:24:03] <%leith_aziz> Sol: kill your wife 3 times and stay away from freinds. Ragna: everyone hates your guts
[2:24:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:24:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah I don't know much about Ragna but I do know that Sol is a walk in the picnic by comparison
[2:24:17] <yeahthatalex> Did they play DNF yet or did they give up?

[3:02:31] <fluke_LKZ> It's Smooth Criminal Hazama
[3:02:36] <+MisterRockett> @gryffinp those are only not 3 different characters on a technicality.
[3:02:39] <%Shad0wTag> BEST SONG INCOMING
[3:02:40] <AllenDeadman> he sure does
[3:02:42] <@Menitta> Terumi is way less cool
[3:02:46] <%dds333a> Aren't they the same?
[3:02:51] <%dds333a> like the person
[3:02:53] <BlackermanZX> Hazama is indeed way cooler
[3:02:59] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Hazama was possessed
[3:03:04] <TheBlackestBaron> different souls, basically
[3:03:06] <mothdude> It turned about Hazama wasn't a fake name, and was an actual guy Terumi possessed.
[3:03:07] <TanyaSaberFace> who else is in the line party
[3:03:10] <%dds333a> yellow hoodie? LUL
[3:03:15] <%townzzzzz> hazama is his spare body
[3:03:19] <%dds333a> wow what?
[3:03:22] <gryffinp> needs more mashing C to death air combos
[3:03:30] <+KngJester> damn what mj do to you
[3:03:32] <mothdude> So Hazama and Terumi get separate bodies in story mode I think.
[3:03:32] <%dds333a> So you can play as the OG terumi
[3:03:38] <+MisterRockett> But then Hazuma ended up being evil anyway?
[3:03:40] <mehfromBL> @mothdude Not exactly. Terumi is possessing someone, but the body he's possessing under the name of Hazama was actually named Kazama or something
[3:03:41] <aftertone> Hazama and Terumi inhabit the same body, are different people. And both are fucking Evil
[3:03:43] <%dds333a> like SIX HEROES terumi?
[3:03:45] <mehfromBL> or was it Kazuma
[3:03:50] <Arqartur0> Isayoi looks looks like and LED Christmas Tree.
[3:04:02] <AverageHanzo> Hazama is way more subdued than Terumi but about as much of a psycho
[3:04:10] <didgereedoodah> Kazama was the guy Terumi possessed
[3:04:11] <TigerClaws12> is that not the Astray color?

[3:07:58] <bigshedman> Wait I thought Zamasu took control of Goku and thus became Goku Black

[3:20:30] <MTLxSpider> OH RIGHT KAGURA
[3:20:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:20:36] <%townzzzzz> only the girls
[3:20:36] <bigshedman> No. Only the women Kappa
[3:20:39] <aftertone> @Menitta Disagree. Big Disagree.
[3:20:39] <TigerClaws12> kagura's a mad perv
[3:20:41] <+nimu290> only the women
[3:20:43] <Div_the_Penguin> analyzing the numbers
[3:20:44] <gryffinp> honestly bullet's proportions are out of control, its too much, and I usually like degeneracy
[3:20:47] <%Wool> Kagura too much of a coward to check out Tager
[3:20:48] <+CaptainPyron> Kagura's big womanizer.
[3:21:07] <aftertone> yes it only happens against female characters
[3:21:11] <aftertone> except Izanami
[3:21:20] <Vendigear> oh, yeah, bullet is definitely a character that's in this game
[3:21:22] <aftertone> and platinum
[3:21:35] <Aganok_> make sure to use the up-down followup after the flashkick, it's free
[3:21:38] <Ginganinja4545> Second best girl only to Kokonoe
[3:21:51] <AverageHanzo> Doesn't he analyze platinum as well and then goes "no, I could go to jail for that"?
[3:21:55] <%townzzzzz> HOT
[3:21:56] <gryffinp> That can't be right, because makoto is best girl
[3:22:00] <Clover_Rabbit> Bullet eats your health if you make even one mistake.
[3:22:02] <AverageHanzo> Kokonoe he doesn't analyze
[3:22:05] <BlackermanZX> bullet combos are sick as hell
[3:22:10] <aftertone> @AverageHanzo I- dont remember
[3:22:23] <huskarl_zap> Kokonoe best personality
[3:22:30] <+pupil31> DAMN
[3:22:32] <%mighty_max_t> Bullet has been my go-to since Noel's mechanics got changed in Chrono phantasma
[3:22:36] <Aganok_> damn
[3:22:48] <Vendigear> ...I should pick up this game bo8Hmm
[3:22:51] <%Wool> it takes a bit to load onto the next player
[3:23:01] <%mighty_max_t> Terumi's weird Meter shenanigans are also fun
[3:23:03] <Clover_Rabbit> Yes please play Blazblue, we need more people
[3:23:11] <gunstars20> MAGNETS
[3:23:19] <%dds333a> Bullet is cool as hell, I missed a ton
[3:23:28] <Aganok_> yeah, being strong or not, Terumi having a bunch of meter is fun
[3:23:29] <%dds333a> BUT NOW, MY DEFENSES
[3:23:33] <%ArcMana> ArcMana subscribed with Prime. 
[3:23:37] <%mighty_max_t> (Also, Noel's non hat design is pretty trash)
[3:23:38] <%ArcMana> I tried to dash in and taunt lock the man
[3:23:40] <gryffinp> I got in the room but I'm not entirely sure how to queue
[3:23:46] <FGBookworm> how do I join the lobby?
[3:23:54] <AverageHanzo> Bullet is really cool and her combos are pretty simple, but man, trying to get on people is hell
[3:23:55] <@Menitta> ok those are actual pot colors
[3:23:58] <%ArcMana> Should I leave? I want a salty runback though
[3:24:10] <saruggado> not-pot skin

[3:27:09] <mehfromBL> @dds333a someone who used to be a dude
[3:27:11] <ghilbor> side novel character
[3:27:11] <gunstars20> A spin off character
[3:27:12] <blackkanye> Okay, but real talk do I gotta ready up or does it notify me of my turn? Only played free for all lobbies
[3:27:13] <aftertone> My wife
[3:27:17] <mothdude> She's the Trans Rights character
[3:27:18] <bigshedman> Is every woman in this game a big titty anime girl?
[3:27:22] <%dds333a> @mehfrombl used to be
[3:27:27] <ChoculaUltra> her doujins are great. or so I heard from a friend, I swear monkaS
[3:27:28] <Clover_Rabbit> @dds333a Mai was a guy at first but due ti magic shenanigans she's a girl now
[3:27:28] <ElPlasa> Koefficient's waifu
[3:27:29] <Div_the_Penguin> a guy that got turned into a girl
[3:27:29] <gryffinp> @bigshedman No. some of them are flat chested.
[3:27:38] <%townzzzzz> KOS MOS COLOR
[3:27:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[3:27:39] <+CaptainPyron> Mai. Lancer girl.
[3:27:40] <Aganok_> @bigshedman only 70% of them
[3:27:42] <%dds333a> yo, that is too based arcsys
[3:27:47] <+the22cstomp> she's new character
[3:27:47] <gunstars20> New for CF
[3:27:50] <mehfromBL> Hey remember fighting Sin? Thatr's a preview
[3:27:51] <FlamingNarwhal> shes a spin off side novel character
[3:27:52] <%dds333a> that's awesome
[3:27:54] <aftertone> Mai is the "Mori loves Fate Stay Night" Character
[3:27:58] <%mighty_max_t> @bigshedman If they arent, jokes are made about it or they are children
[3:28:00] <FlamingNarwhal> she has lock on spears
[3:28:06] <BlackermanZX> like 90% of the characters stab people tho
[3:28:07] <gryffinp> Being Lancer is suffering
[3:28:11] <@Menitta> she was in the story prior iirc
[3:28:13] <Hyde_01> @aftertone i thought that was Es
[3:28:17] <mothdude> She was buds with Noel and Tsubaki in school iirc
[3:28:21] <Clover_Rabbit> Mai is a new character who was in a few Manga's
[3:28:24] <aftertone> @Hyde_01 Mai is Scathach
[3:28:25] <Josef_Stryker> Have they checked out our faced an Azrael yet?
[3:28:28] <Josef_Stryker> *or
[3:28:34] <ChoculaUltra> does she also share the same cruel end that almost all Fate Lancers seem to have?
[3:28:36] <%mr_sups> Mai, Naoto and Es are from Manga and Visual Novel spin-offs
[3:28:36] <%andrewofbob> @bigshedman This is a bit for some of the characters. Noel and her clones are flat; after Makoto's bad end in BBCS, Kokonoe refuses to give her hint due to jealousy
[3:28:42] <gunstars20> When's the Azrael chat
[3:28:43] <%dds333a> Is any mention really made to who she used to be, or is she for all intents and purposes treated female?
[3:28:45] <%Shad0wTag> Anyone can give me tldr on why or how she was turned into a girl
[3:28:49] <primaryfire> she also has a unique system for attacks that differs from gatlings
[3:28:51] <+Kataiser> Died on 100 meter.
[3:28:59] <mehfromBL> @Shad0wTag magic book or something iirc
[3:29:05] <blackkanye> @Shad0wTag magic book can't be used by dudes so turned her into girl
[3:29:06] <%Shad0wTag> i'll take it
[3:29:06] <Clover_Rabbit> @dds333a for story purposes she's treated as a girl
[3:29:09] <Zerotoad5> Magic book turned mai girl is happy being girl stay girl
[3:29:12] <gryffinp> @Shad0wTag @dds333a @Shad0wTag read the manga
[3:29:28] <%dds333a> I dig it
[3:29:32] <%Shad0wTag> yeah im not that commited thats why i asked for a tldr
[3:29:33] <didgereedoodah> charges are 35 frames I think
[3:29:42] <didgereedoodah> or 45
[3:29:50] <gryffinp> Almost got to see that astral
[3:29:59] <%dds333a> she also fights pretty well, although that spear is huge LUL
[3:30:05] <%townzzzzz> gotta get in
[3:30:09] <ElPlasa> it's complicated
[3:30:13] <+Kataiser> Active Flow is positive bonus. Play big aggro or use your Exceed Accel.
[3:30:17] <Josef_Stryker> I just appreciate more spear/lance users
[3:30:18] <ghilbor> faster meter and less damage proration
[3:30:22] <Josef_Stryker> Too many sword fighters
[3:30:23] <gunstars20> We need Sick azrael combos
[3:30:28] <FluorescentLB> Using Invulnerable moves when the opponent is attacking is another way
[3:30:29] <Aganok_> yeah, by being aggressive or blocking well
[3:30:31] <bigshedman> @Kataiser That first sentence sounds like a fucking podcast title LUL
[3:30:35] <aftertone> the creepy thing about Mai's genderbend is that the magic book slowly shaped her soul to the one of a girl until she was fine with it. Wether she liked it or not . Still my waifu
[3:30:37] <Clover_Rabbit> Did they fight Naoto yet?
[3:30:51] <Josef_Stryker> I think so
[3:31:07] <SunsetJack> Can people leave so others can join?
[3:31:11] <primaryfire> naoto was one of the first ones
[3:31:11] <TigerClaws12> yea the best way to tell people is "just be aggressive"
[3:31:14] <Aganok_> it's a lot like GRD from UNI, but invisible
[3:31:15] <Div_the_Penguin> @Shad0wTag turned into a girl because of grimoire or something like that and when introduced it's just something that happened before you meet the character
[3:31:28] <primaryfire> a lot of people are just hanging out in here it seems?
[3:31:29] <%andrewofbob> The negative penalty has also always been obscure
[3:31:34] <MTLxSpider> kick Meh and iok. they already played 1 match
[3:31:36] <blackkanye> no
[3:31:40] <+Axle13j> nah they're passing
[3:31:41] <blackkanye> it is going around
[3:31:45] <TigerClaws12> they're passing
[3:31:51] <%dds333a> @aganok_ that helps, for me, since I haven't played BB in a long time
[3:32:03] <@Menitta> oh wait you can only do one match at a time in this room?
[3:32:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis
[3:32:14] <%townzzzzz> koko puffs
[3:32:14] <mehfromBL> ooo a relius player
[3:32:17] <gryffinp> I think it can be set different ways
[3:32:17] <huskarl_zap> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:32:24] <gunstars20> Ay Kokonoe
[3:32:25] <Clover_Rabbit> this gonna be good
[3:32:26] <%dds333a> DADDY
[3:32:26] <primaryfire> I just let active flow happen on its own man
[3:32:29] <Aganok_> @Menitta yeah, unless it's a free for all room
[3:32:29] <didgereedoodah> Reggie getting in the real nitty gritty
[3:32:29] <BlackermanZX> eyy Kokonoe
[3:32:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, Kokonoe
[3:32:34] <MTLxSpider> theres a lot of people trying to get in. leaving to let people a chance :)
[3:32:35] <mehfromBL> or not i guess. oh well, at least koko
[3:32:35] <%dds333a> aww, no puppet daddy :(
[3:32:41] <Clover_Rabbit> kokonow, the true best girl
[3:32:43] <aftertone> anything activates it
[3:32:49] <%dds333a> kokonoe is playable now?
[3:32:52] <SunsetJack> Using meter, making moves whiff invul, moving forward, etc.
[3:32:56] <gryffinp> kokonoe playing to MOTOR-HEAD 1? based
[3:32:58] <%andrewofbob> Negative penalty deletes it
[3:32:59] <FlamingNarwhal> its like the aggro bonus in guilty gear
[3:33:04] <%dds333a> she used to be the bad ending guide
[3:33:05] <mehfromBL> Genesic used to instant Active Flow, not sure if that was ever patched out
[3:33:05] <+Kataiser> Aggro. Just play hard. It has the similar activation reqs as Active Flow.
[3:33:10] <ghilbor> it's gg tension basically
[3:33:11] <%townzzzzz> SO BEING UNGA
[3:33:16] <Clover_Rabbit> @dds333a playable since third game
[3:33:24] <+Kataiser> Er, Positive Bonus. Brain no good
[3:33:31] <FlamingNarwhal> is that kokone color just kakyoin?
[3:33:32] <+Axle13j> Kokonoe is scary
[3:33:33] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus its like uniel grd meter. but you dont see it
[3:33:37] <Aganok_> yeah, it's a lot like Tension Pulse/Positive from GG
[3:33:40] <%dds333a> @cloverfield_rabbit that is neat. is EVERYONE playable now LUL
[3:33:43] <+Axle13j> omfg it is Kakyoin LUL
[3:33:56] <Clover_Rabbit> @dds333a indeed they are.
[3:34:01] <gryffinp> kokonoe saying the traditional fighter yells "sora sora" and "chesto" in the most bored voice possible is the best bit

[3:42:15] <%kyh9> @dds333a SISIGAMI
[3:42:16] <blackkanye> Reggie didn't Astral me Kappa
[3:42:17] <ghilbor> LUL
[3:42:19] <+Rasheedt> woolieKICKDAD
[3:42:21] <dragonica> and he gets it
[3:42:23] <aftertone> That Mai should have done command jump
[3:42:24] <%InvisiblessedReptile> lobby players hate this one weird trick
[3:42:26] <huskarl_zap> Chat also.wants one thing
[3:42:32] <gryffinp> @townzzzzz rip
[3:42:32] <aftertone> thats her fault
[3:42:35] <huskarl_zap> and it's Kokonoe
[3:42:36] <%Wool> rip that one guy that got skipped the whole time lmao
[3:42:38] <nintega010> need a good azrael to put him in his place
[3:42:39] <%Irridium> damn never got to play. ah well.
[3:42:41] <%townzzzzz> thems the breaks
[3:42:42] <mehfromBL> poor gryffn
[3:42:44] <%jinking79> so no more holding back on Reggie matches
[3:42:45] <blackkanye> Yes I want kokonoe. Imagine the smell
[3:42:50] <%InvisiblessedReptile> remember, Canada to Brazil felt great, so PLEASE implement rollback in your games, devs
[3:42:50] <%kyh9> @Emperor_Machinus Arakune is okay too I guess.  That's the list, Bang and Arakune.  Everyone else, please go to the back of the line and let your superior Guilty Gear equivalent ahead
[3:42:51] <%mr_sups> You can loose the match, but if you get an Astral finish in a round. That's a moral vicory.
[3:42:55] <%dds333a> that distortion, I mean
[3:43:05] <%dds333a> The wife is calling LUL
[3:43:09] <aftertone> Anyway Blazblue characers are great. Except Bang, screw that guy.
[3:43:09] <+pupil31> BABIES
[3:43:14] <didgereedoodah> There is no GG equivalent of Litchi
[3:43:20] <didgereedoodah> that I can think of at least
[3:43:30] <teflonbilly777> Is there a GG equivalent to Jubei?
[3:43:35] <gryffinp> slayer?
[3:43:38] <nintega010> @aftertone nah arakune screw him
[3:43:41] <+akingofnoobs> woolieEVIL
[3:43:42] <%dds333a> @didgereedoodah the equivalent is jam, but I dunno about superior
[3:43:43] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @didgereedoodah she's high IQ
[3:43:44] <%kyh9> @MisterRockett Fair, though Bang and Answer are on complete opposite spectrums of design.  Answer is a businessman with a scarf and mask, Bang might as well be a Dungeon Fighter character
[3:43:48] <Aganok_> Venom can technically do most of the things Litchi does, but it feels different
[3:43:48] <MTLxSpider> lol you cant compare both games AT ALL.
[3:44:15] <teflonbilly777> I like the Jam like design of Striker in DNF Duel. Dem's some nice curves
[3:44:42] <%jinking79> Christmas week almost here
[3:44:51] <gryffinp> there's like Jin and Ky being fairly similar and tager and pot being big grappler bois but then you have to dilate your pupils to convince yourself that ragna=sol because both red and rushdown and then it kinda falls apart from there
[3:44:51] <aftertone> @nintega010 Nah. The Bang players here.
[3:44:52] <OldManDeckardCain> you mean an artist built it? Kappa
[3:45:09] <+BadassCyborg3000> I did better than I expected with my rusty Mai. GGs Woolie and Reggie.
[3:45:09] <Vendigear> is this the part where woolie tells me to shave my balls?
[3:45:18] <blackkanye> You sayin' a chicken fried that computer?
[3:45:20] <didgereedoodah> Ragna is honestly more Dante than Sol
[3:45:26] <%dds333a> Real talk, I love Bang LUL
[3:45:33] <%dds333a> never really played him tho
[3:45:33] <didgereedoodah> visually
[3:45:44] <Aganok_> yeah, even the old characters are very different from GG stuff, like Rachel and Nu
[3:45:46] <teflonbilly777> My buddy who way outclasses me in BB mains Bang
[3:46:00] <gruulmagebeast> who does woolie and reggie play?
[3:46:02] <Vendigear> ad break! rooBobble
[3:46:08] <aftertone> Izanamii is the one I love the most visually. Slowly learning her.
[3:46:08] <teflonbilly777> ROLLBACK IS HERE TO STAY
[3:46:09] <%kyh9> Gay Rollback
[3:46:14] <gryffinp> Woolie has been playing Kagura, Reggie Izayoi
[3:46:21] <%dds333a> @gruulmagebeast I don't think they play this game like that LUL
[3:46:21] <Aganok_> Brazil is always waiting for you
[3:46:25] <gryffinp> Woolie also has a Susano
[3:46:26] <%kyh9> I don't want to fight against brazilian cryptominers
[3:46:27] <blackkanye> I will never forgive brazil for what they've done Kappa
[3:46:30] <%dds333a> But yeah, kagura and izayoi
[3:46:31] <%InvisiblessedReptile> lesgo, baby, Brazil mentioned and now it's with rollback
[3:46:34] <aftertone> Brazil still feels bad AND IM FROM VENEZUELA
[3:46:41] <%kyh9> BANG
[3:46:42] <%townzzzzz> WOOLIE YOU GOTTA LAND YOUR AH DO IT
[3:46:45] <%kyh9> S I S I G A M I
[3:46:46] <+Axle13j> she's super fun
[3:46:48] <%jinking79> don't let Reggie land his Astral woolieMIRIN
[3:46:48] <gruulmagebeast> golden tager time?
[3:46:51] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @aftertone yes! This is a problem still
[3:46:52] <teflonbilly777> I thought Brazil was busy playing the KOF XV open beta
[3:46:53] <%kyh9> Bang bros
[3:47:01] <gryffinp> The Overpowered Boss Character!
[3:47:01] <%dds333a> I played lambda a lot
[3:47:04] <%mr_sups> She's a gundam
[3:47:04] <%InvisiblessedReptile> @teflonbilly777 no Rugal in the game
[3:47:05] <%dds333a> in extend
[3:47:11] <mehfromBL> off course woolie played the boss character
[3:47:12] <%andrewofbob> Woolie on the boss character again?
[3:47:14] <%mr_sups> Yes
[3:47:15] <+Axle13j> LUL
[3:47:16] <%dds333a> nu is the og final boss LUL
[3:47:16] <aftertone> Kokonoe is traps and set ups
[3:47:20] <Aganok_> only the boomers, the kids are on anime fighters @teflonbilly777
[3:47:22] <TigerClaws12> no justice color :(
[3:47:26] <%dds333a> ultimate lambda was also just nu LUL
[3:47:27] <gryffinp> nu13 WAS overpowered in Calamity Trigger
[3:47:29] <teflonbilly777> @teflonbilly777 Poor Max still hasn't gotten his Rock Howard
[3:47:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> I clapped, he did the thing
[3:47:34] <%jinking79> Nu is now a Vegetable
[3:47:36] <gruulmagebeast> is there any difference gameplay wise between nu and lamda in this?
[3:47:39] <+pupil31> tiny balls
[3:47:41] <+Kataiser> Nu had a 9-1 matchup in CT.
[3:47:42] <%dds333a> unlimited, I mean

[3:47:56] <%dds333a> SHINSOU
[3:47:57] <Aganok_> yoo Shinso
[3:47:59] <teflonbilly777> Kokonoe needs a Futaba color scheme
[3:48:02] <Aganok_> best opening
[3:48:07] <%kyh9> Squid-game ass characters
[3:48:21] <gryffinp> "Chesto."
[3:48:21] <%kyh9> You've got a whole season of shit-tier season anime designs to choose from
[3:48:25] <%andrewofbob> Kokonoe can set up magnets to alter the fireball's path
[3:48:33] <%mr_sups> @kyh9 You really do.
[3:48:35] <%dds333a> I was better with Lambda, but my heart belonged to makoto LUL
[3:49:01] <%kyh9> @kyh9 Move over Asterisk War, there's a new garbage dump in town
[3:49:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:49:07] <teflonbilly777> Is there any fighter more granular with individual character systems than BB?
[3:49:08] <%andrewofbob> Very wrong super
[3:49:14] <ghilbor> her magnets move both you and your opponent
[3:49:20] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> !MOTIVIATED
[3:49:32] <Aganok_> Granblue and Xrd did try
[3:49:57] <%dds333a> that's the plan
[3:50:10] <thelivingglitch307> those sword formations are like.... Joachim
[3:50:15] <teflonbilly777> Granblue didn't look like it had enough characters and it may be familiarity, but I never thought Xrd was close to as weird in that
[3:50:19] <%townzzzzz> sword to the head
[3:50:30] <didgereedoodah> full screen overhead
[3:50:34] <gryffinp> Happy Chaos is basically a Blazblue character

[3:50:40] <@Moobot> @thelivingglitch307 2417 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:50:41] <gryffinp> he has a drive button instead of a heavy slash
[3:50:42] <%dds333a> Nu has some nasty setups
[3:50:45] <@Menitta> He kinda is LUL
[3:50:47] <teflonbilly777> They've lowered the price in general on Granblue on the PSN store
[3:50:48] <Aganok_> Xrd had a few characters with very specific stuff like Venom, Bedman, Baiken, Answer
[3:51:04] <+MisterRockett> love her tiny Kaka clan jacket.
[3:51:08] <@Menitta> Blazblue is cool. Idk why it never clicked with me compared to Guilty Gear though
[3:51:10] <Aganok_> those I'd say are basically BlazBlue characters
[3:51:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Aganok_ J a c k - O
[3:51:21] <%dds333a> @misterrockett with the paws <3
[3:51:26] <@Menitta> Jack O is Arakune but a waifu
[3:51:32] <Aganok_> god, there's all 3 of the Valentine sisters, they're weird
[3:51:38] <teflonbilly777> Oh yeah, Jack-O in Rev 2 was weird af
[3:51:39] <gryffinp> Kokonoe is a gadget-wielding hyper catgirl except she's 37 and wishes she was drinking
[3:51:43] <ghilbor> catJAM
[3:52:08] <Aganok_> Elphelt is the least unique one, and even then she has a sniper

[3:53:11] <blackkanye> Yeah stream almost shit itself LUL
[3:53:14] <teflonbilly777> That's Engrish
[3:53:18] <+MisterRockett> @kulmoth is she even capable of magic? her mom is magic but she might just not be able.
[3:53:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Reminder that Kokonoe is so metal, she SURGICALLY REMOVED HER EMOTIONS TO FUCK OVER TERUMI
[3:53:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> @thelivingglitch307 system voice
[3:53:35] <TheBlackestBaron> @MisterRockett Her astral is magic
[3:53:35] <mothdude> I think she can use magic but choose not to to spite her mom.
[3:53:39] <gunstars20> Kokonoe can definitely use magic
[3:54:00] <whobeee> @MisterRockett She is very good at magic but hates her mom so she only does it to pull a literal meteor out of the sky in her astral
[3:54:06] <+Axle13j> Nu's so cool
[3:54:09] <teflonbilly777> Man, I have not kept up with the BB lore
[3:54:11] <+Emperor_Machinus> She dislikes magic from what I remember and thinks science is the way
[3:54:18] <%dds333a> @whobeee she has a colony drop? LUL
[3:54:18] <Aganok_> Kokonoe is such a great character throughout the whole franchise LUL
[3:54:26] <teflonbilly777> I still lol at the scene from the BB anime with Ragna The Loli-lover
[3:54:39] <+MisterRockett> I forget the actual deal with her mom is cause I know Nine is being possessed and actually loves her family but I forget if Koko hates her because of her original relationship or her relationship with her possessed mom.
[3:54:43] <%dds333a> Hilda before hilda, yeah
[3:55:03] <+Axle13j> @teflonbilly777 comes up a couple times in gag reels too iirc LUL
[3:55:13] <%dds333a> ALIGNING
[3:55:16] <+MisterRockett> NINE
[3:55:29] <%dds333a> chain revolver shit LUL
[3:55:33] <@Menitta> Yes Noel
[3:55:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I feel like every BB character had at least ONE moment of being cool
[3:55:36] <%Neo_Kyon> Yooo Noel :)
[3:55:37] <+MisterRockett> Noelle is a mediocre Tsubaki from what I hear.
[3:55:39] <+Axle13j> You can get her hat in this
[3:55:40] <gryffinp> you can unlock the hat in the in-game store
[3:55:41] <@Menitta> I like her without the hat tbh
[3:55:41] <%townzzzzz> HAT IS DLC
[3:55:41] <teflonbilly777> BRING BACK THE HAT
[3:55:44] <+Emperor_Machinus> unlock the hat
[3:55:47] <+Kataiser> There was a hat here. It's gone now.
[3:55:49] <+BadassCyborg3000> You can unlock the Hat
[3:55:53] <BlackermanZX> he has the other costume here right
[3:55:56] <thelivingglitch307> I hear Noel is low tier
[3:55:58] <aftertone> Hat is not DLC. Hat is in the gallery
[3:55:59] <@Menitta> isnt Tsubaki an asshole?
[3:56:03] <Aganok_> same, the hat wings are whack
[3:56:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[3:56:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> i like her hat
[3:56:10] <+Axle13j> little bit lol of an asshole lol
[3:56:10] <primaryfire> hat is purchasable with ingame currency
[3:56:12] <@Menitta> oh my god the zombie color
[3:56:15] <didgereedoodah> Tsubaki is a cop
[3:56:16] <%andrewofbob> @Menitta Tsubaki is Lawful Stupid
[3:56:16] <%kyh9> Tsubaki is a shit-tier design.  Green skin is cool tho
[3:56:19] <%dds333a> @menitta not before, unless that was changed
[3:56:19] <%kyh9> Need more zombie girls
[3:56:19] <Puhff> SQUEEEE
[3:56:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Menitta Izayoi is. Tsubaki is kinda ok though
[3:56:22] <ghilbor> tsubaki's a law enjoyer
[3:56:24] <%kyh9> Zombie Girl representation
[3:56:29] <%kyh9> Die noel
[3:56:34] <%Deft_Thought> @Menitta She gets mind controlled by her weapons
[3:56:36] <%kyh9> What if Ky Kiske was a girl
[3:56:40] <%dds333a> thi  is the tsubaki I'm more familiar with
[3:56:41] <nonagonjimfinity> that guitar was intense
[3:56:44] <gryffinp> matchup specific intros and themes were largely lost in the transition to xrd and strive's 3d and that's a damn shame (not that this is their matchup theme)
[3:56:46] <%Deft_Thought> And eventually becomes a Super Cop
[3:56:50] <+Emperor_Machinus> @kyh9 No = easier access to the brains
[3:56:54] <%dds333a> @kyh9 you stay winning, goddamn
[3:56:55] <+Axle13j> I still love how one of Tsubaki's story modes had a bad end if you used her D attacks too much
[3:56:56] <+Emperor_Machinus> hat
[3:56:56] <teflonbilly777> You know what anime character would fit perfect in BB? Tanya from Youjo Senki
[3:56:56] <UnpleasantJackhammer> monkaS FireSpeed
[3:57:01] <teflonbilly777> She even has magic sigils!
[3:57:02] <%dds333a> zombies are the best monster girls
[3:57:04] <%kyh9> What if Bridget but worse
[3:57:09] <blackkanye> @Axle13j That is dope
[3:57:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also Izayoi makes her gradually lose sight becaus, "Justice is blind" haw haw
[3:57:16] <Aganok_> oh yeah, Tanya fits right in
[3:57:25] <Loopykun> she is just equilibrium girl
[3:57:25] <@Menitta> I played Tsubaki for a bit. Shes fun
[3:57:27] <%townzzzzz> gotta charge like order sol
[3:57:28] <AverageHanzo> And Noel's exceed accel is literally P4A Aigis reference which is cool

[3:57:48] <@Menitta> holy shit

[3:57:51] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[3:57:55] <+Emperor_Machinus> Counter counter COUNTER!
[3:58:19] <Aganok_> Tsubaki having followups to everything she does is pretty fun
[3:58:23] <%townzzzzz> land her AH woolie
[3:58:25] <teflonbilly777> I do love the animations on Noel going full Christian Bale
[3:58:29] <%Deft_Thought> Do Tsubaki's mechanics work the same in this game?
[3:58:34] <Puhff> woolieYE woolieYE
[3:58:39] <%dds333a> big chaingun
[3:58:39] <%Deft_Thought> She used to be Order Sol
[3:58:46] <Aganok_> she's still Order Sol
[3:58:47] <+Axle13j> Pretty sure its the same
[3:58:50] <@Menitta> NICE
[3:58:52] <gryffinp> BLUE BEAT
[3:58:53] <gryffinp> NOT REAL
[3:58:54] <+Axle13j> NOICE

[3:58:54] <teflonbilly777> SKEET SHOOTING
[3:58:54] <LordOfThePoultry> YOOOOO
[3:58:56] <+MisterRockett> I hate Noel's characterization but I turned around on her gameplay when I realized she has Gunslinger Dante moves. And then I learned she's low tier.
[3:58:58] <%kyh9> That timer is to indicate how long until Noel is too old for the average Blazblue fan
[3:59:01] <%Deft_Thought> @Aganok_ Oh word
[3:59:03] <%Neo_Kyon> bawkPoggers
[3:59:06] <teflonbilly777> BLAP BLAP
[3:59:10] <+Emperor_Machinus> plank wins
[3:59:10] <Arqartur0> Daaaaayum
[3:59:25] <%dds333a> @kyh9 unironically based
[3:59:26] <teflonbilly777> Moonlight
[3:59:28] <+MisterRockett> @kyh9 she's always been an adult? this joke makes more sense with Platinum.
[3:59:31] <didgereedoodah> I love BB stages so much
[3:59:33] <%dds333a> the moonlight ver
[3:59:42] <Aganok_> this stage is so beautiful in the other version
[3:59:47] <%dds333a> The ragna vs rachel version LUL
[3:59:47] <gryffinp> I think this one was usually used when Rachel was acting as a boss fight in CT
[3:59:57] <truta_> how good is noel, chat? she looks kinda cool
[4:00:08] <%andrewofbob> Am I alone in preferring the original soundtrack to the new arrangements?
[4:00:08] <Aganok_> Noel is definitely low tier
[4:00:10] <aftertone> @truta_ low tier. But its fine
[4:00:11] <+Axle13j> she's bottom tier. but she's super fun, go for it
[4:00:11] <%kyh9> @MisterRockett I was making a christmas cake joke but you're also right.   same with Rachel
[4:00:27] <+Emperor_Machinus> Plank is botten tier but fun
[4:00:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> She's order sol
[4:00:34] <Aganok_> @andrewofbob not really, the original was more heavy metal and less symphonic metal
[4:00:35] <TigerClaws12> she's HOS
[4:00:35] <aftertone> Tsubaki is basically Order Sol
[4:00:38] <+nimu290> it's used for ragna vs rachel
[4:00:41] <didgereedoodah> possibly the worst character, but will destroy anyone who doesn't know the matchup
[4:00:42] <%kyh9> You think Noel gets carpal tunnel?
[4:00:44] <Aganok_> I prefer some of the older tracks
[4:00:45] <%dds333a> @andrewofbob from what I've heard, I agree
[4:00:51] <BlackermanZX> i remember Noel being somewhat beginner friendly
[4:00:56] <+Kataiser> Honestly bottom tier in BBCF isn't a huge handicap as long as you're not fighting one of the characters at the very tip top.
[4:00:57] <+Axle13j> oh yeah, anyone who doesn't know how to fight her gets blown up lol
[4:00:59] <gryffinp> @andrewofbob almost every song in CF that has "II" after its name is worse than the original, except perhaps Blood Pain
[4:01:08] <+Axle13j> @Kataiser this
[4:01:10] <%dds333a> Alexandrite og sounds better, but I never liked alexandrite too much anyway LUL
[4:01:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Noel does look cool when fighting
[4:01:12] <%kyh9> Like imagine if the guns she's super-glued to aren't designed for her hand size, must be uncomfortable
[4:01:27] <Aganok_> I can definitely argue for Lust Sin II and Gluttonu Fang II because they're so classy already
[4:01:28] <%Shad0wTag> @andrewofbob Gluttony Fang II and Rebellion II are improvements
[4:01:31] <ghilbor> plastic night 2 is pretty god tier
[4:01:39] <didgereedoodah> Sword of Doom II is much better
[4:01:40] <gryffinp> rebellion 2 is way worse than rebellion 1 you are crazy
[4:01:42] <ghilbor> same for howling moon
[4:01:52] <%Shad0wTag> @gryffinp Nah man you are too harsh

[4:02:11] <+Axle13j> welp this is awkward LUL
[4:02:11] <gryffinp> rebellion 2 has no idea where it's going, it just meanders around re-doing reb.1's themes
[4:02:14] <BlackermanZX> LUL

[4:02:16] <didgereedoodah> COUNTER ASTRAL
[4:02:21] <+Axle13j> Motor Head 1 > EVERYTHING
[4:02:22] <%andrewofbob> I think both Rebellions have their merits, but Susanooh II erodes what was great about the original
[4:02:38] <+Emperor_Machinus> Plank wins

[4:02:52] <%Shad0wTag> @kyh9 fun but beta is all over the place
[4:02:54] <gryffinp> the kamina colors are overused
[4:03:00] <%dds333a> they liked the game itself, but they were not impressed with the betw

[4:03:09] <+OroOreo> The main man
[4:03:19] <%dds333a> nails are cool
[4:03:23] <+jinz3898> Bang does have a nice ost
[4:03:24] <%dds333a> come on LUL
[4:03:25] <$Noponis> bang is so insanely lame wdym
[4:03:26] <%kyh9> Nails are cool, die casuals
[4:03:27] <+Axle13j> Fuck yeah Azrael
[4:03:27] <%andrewofbob> Only 12 fireballs/jumppoints
[4:03:30] <primaryfire> we have answer at home
[4:03:34] <Aganok_> Bang having the rain of nails is so cool, but he's so technical
[4:03:35] <Arqartur0> Which is better: custom colors, or different skins?
[4:03:41] <$Noponis> his weird half naked outfit is jsut whack
[4:03:42] <Afrosamasenpai> AZRAEL THE BOY
[4:03:43] <%kyh9> Make your own jump patterns, the character
[4:03:44] <huskarl_zap> Put on the wedding dress Azreal
[4:03:45] <BlackermanZX> oh McDonalds colors
[4:03:45] <%dds333a> yo this guy is fast
[4:03:52] <didgereedoodah> Azrael king of + frames
[4:03:52] <gryffinp> @Arqartur0 capcom has convinced me that character skins were a mistake
[4:03:58] <%andrewofbob> The only other fighting game character I know with finite ammo is Arbiter from KI
[4:04:01] <%dds333a> @primaryfire answer before answer LUL
[4:04:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Arqartur0 Depends, Custom colors like CvS2 or Type Lumina?
[4:04:17] <%dds333a> this azrael dude is nuts
[4:04:35] <Aganok_> Azrael is way too fun
[4:04:41] <Arqartur0> @alteisenreisez good point, type lumina
[4:04:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, he's nuts if he thinks that Kamina cosplay is gonna fool anyone. LUL
[4:04:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:04:45] <%dds333a> that dash is on a button?
[4:04:45] <AverageHanzo> Azrael also has probably the coolest astral in the game
[4:04:50] <%kyh9> Azrael feels a little too tryhard for his archetype, but that's everything in Blazblue
[4:04:55] <gryffinp> pose on em
[4:04:56] <primaryfire> @dds333a I stand by what I said
[4:04:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Arqartur0 then skins
[4:05:01] <%kyh9> Like, I like Zenos a lot more than Azrael
[4:05:14] <%kyh9> Even though they're the same core archetype
[4:05:25] <%dds333a> big slams
[4:05:30] <+Axle13j> the pounce
[4:05:34] <%kyh9> Damn, Elon Musk's kid got WASHED here
[4:05:36] <%dds333a> screen shake LUL
[4:05:42] <%kyh9> That's Elon Musk's kid on the right, yeah?
[4:05:45] <Aganok_> did Zenos rip a dimension prison with his bare hands though
[4:05:49] <DrGrym> What about the drive moves
[4:05:54] <gryffinp> @Aganok_ not YET
[4:06:00] <blackkanye> What zenos we talkin' about?
[4:06:04] <Arqartur0> I am torn, because, skins are a just ways for micro transactions, but, sometimes skins are fun
[4:06:08] <%dds333a> The terror LUL
[4:06:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Aganok_  :)
[4:06:11] <whobeee> Gustav is +1 on block just as a heads up
[4:06:14] <%kyh9> @Aganok_ I'm fairly sure he was banging his head against it given that he broke threw it head-first when we see him
[4:06:14] <AverageHanzo> I also love how Azrael in the BB lore is never explained, he's basically just the guy that comes in to punch stuff and somehow is one of the strongest characters LUL
[4:06:15] <whobeee> Fun move
[4:06:16] <+kinmarik> sweet I haven't missed the online play yet. BlazBlue been giving me lumps so I'm excited to see how the woolievs crew handle it
[4:06:26] <@Menitta> Azreal's astral is cool as fuck
[4:06:26] <Arqartur0> Ala Capcom x tekken
[4:06:26] <%dds333a> this guy has a pretty simple moveset, all things considered
[4:06:32] <aftertone> only real blazblue players know what THE TERROR means...
[4:06:36] <+Axle13j> @kinmarik they went online already lol
[4:06:40] <%Shad0wTag> @AverageHanzo wasn't he in prison and someone broke him out or something
[4:06:41] <%kyh9> Is that a Q-taunt???
[4:06:49] <gryffinp> "Azrael why is your astral named patriot apocalypse, you have no allegiance to any power beyond your own?" "lol. lmao"
[4:06:54] <huskarl_zap> fetus of God in the background
[4:06:54] <%andrewofbob> @kinmarik There's been some online play; I think they're exiting after these locals
[4:07:07] <%dds333a> @huskarl_zap classic stage LUL
[4:07:12] <AverageHanzo> @Shad0wTag yea, he got imprisoned in a dimensional prison that is inescapable, just to escape using his bare hands the next game LUL
[4:07:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> All of Azrael's moves are named after missiles
[4:07:28] <+Axle13j> @Shad0wTag They put him in a freezer, let him out, he fucked everything up, then they put him in an inescapable dimension, he escaped
[4:07:30] <+kinmarik> dang guess I'll have to catch the anime
[4:07:32] <%dds333a> so azrael is just the barely contained strong dude LUL
[4:07:38] <%dds333a> on the roster?
[4:07:45] <gryffinp> oh god don't watch the blazblue anime
[4:07:45] <blackkanye> YES
[4:07:47] <aftertone> @dds333a yeah
[4:07:50] <blackkanye> except they can't contain him literally
[4:07:59] <aftertone> @dds333a those tattoos are limiters
[4:08:09] <%dds333a> yo. he got LIMITERS LUL
[4:08:16] <%townzzzzz> MISS
[4:08:18] <%dds333a> and he's still crazy
[4:08:23] <blackkanye> yes
[4:08:25] <+Axle13j> 236D after applying a weak point and hitting forward to chase is the best part about azrael
[4:08:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yo he really said "OOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
[4:08:39] <+Kataiser> Valiant is def the hype-creator
[4:08:41] <Aganok_> yeah, Azrael having up and side Dust is funny AF
[4:08:45] <gryffinp> celica gaming
[4:08:50] <%townzzzzz> why not some ragna
[4:08:52] <%dds333a> another puppet character?
[4:08:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh Ram colors
[4:08:57] <+Axle13j> the shenanigans with the chase are the best
[4:09:00] <%dds333a> that makes three
[4:09:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Relius is a HTTF Character
[4:09:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> He's so fun
[4:09:05] <Aganok_> except this one's not actually a puppet character
[4:09:06] <primaryfire> celica is more of a gio, relis is actually a puppet character
[4:09:11] <gryffinp> we talked about all of the noels and the terumis and the jins but how many puppet people are there
[4:09:13] <%dds333a> although carl and relius are super different LUL
[4:09:13] <MTLxSpider> mh hm
[4:09:16] <+jinz3898> Clover have some interesting arc finish on characters
[4:09:20] <whobeee> She doesn't act like a puppet character
[4:09:21] <+Axle13j> Celica is basically Gio. She's not really a puppet character
[4:09:22] <blackkanye> No Celica isn't a puppet character
[4:09:23] <aftertone> she is not a puppet
[4:09:23] <%dds333a> @aganok_ oh no?
[4:09:24] <+Kataiser> Celica's only thematically a puppet character, not mechanically.
[4:09:26] <$Noponis> she isnt much of a puppet
[4:09:26] <Zerotoad5> She spends blue health on specials
[4:09:27] <BlackermanZX> Celica is not a puppet character really
[4:09:28] <gryffinp> Queen of Rose II I believe
[4:09:38] <Aganok_> the Doll fights for her, Celica doesn't do much
[4:09:41] <%andrewofbob> It's more of a wheelcheer/exosuit
[4:09:42] <Reisadan> As much sense as it makes and how easy it is to read and parse... I still can't stand numpad notation, BUT I KNOW IT'S THE BEST WAY
[4:09:42] <%dds333a> Okay, so she's not like the two
[4:09:57] <gryffinp> @Reisadan 632146D
[4:09:58] <%jinking79> turn both your Wife and Daughter into puppets
[4:10:00] <kulmoth> its a puppet but not a puppet character if that makes any sense
[4:10:18] <+kinmarik> I enjoyed the BlazBlue anime it's decent fanservice plus hazuma got some hilarious moments
[4:10:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:10:19] <%dds333a> so relius and his kid are the actual puppet characters
[4:10:29] <%dds333a> despite also being worlds apart
[4:10:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Woolie, she's a Stand
[4:10:39] <Aganok_> the BB anime is definitely fun if you go in expecting an absolute trainwreck
[4:10:40] <ghilbor> you need to unsummon her to let her recover
[4:10:40] <%andrewofbob> The meter recharges when the doll is put away
[4:10:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Think of it like HTTF
[4:10:50] <aftertone> Relius works more liki a JOJO HFTF character
[4:10:55] <gryffinp> @AlteisenReiseZ bad example because relius is the one who's puppet works like stands worked in Heritage to the Future
[4:11:04] <%dds333a> yeah relius, kidna uses tandem
[4:11:26] <%dds333a> there it is LUL
[4:11:33] <%dds333a> What the fuck
[4:11:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @gryffinp that's what i was implying

[4:11:42] <gryffinp> Celica's unique mechanic is actually healing bullshit
[4:11:50] <%dds333a> what is the name of Celica's puppet
[4:11:52] <BlackermanZX> Litchi is fun
[4:11:53] <ElPlasa> WONDER WHY
[4:11:56] <gryffinp> fun fact: litchi's moves are named after Mahjong hands
[4:11:57] <%townzzzzz> cannon fight
[4:11:58] <+Axle13j> not THE BEEEES
[4:11:58] <%dds333a> we had ada and Minerva
[4:11:59] <primaryfire> litchi is super sick
[4:11:59] <Aganok_> I think the puppet is called Minerva
[4:12:00] <blackkanye> I wonder why Kappa
[4:12:03] <%kyh9> Ah, finally
[4:12:04] <gunstars20> Litchi has cool stuff
[4:12:05] <%kyh9> A good character

[4:12:17] <blackkanye> We do not shake arakune hands

[4:12:21] <gryffinp> its a shame they have music on random because Weak Executioner

[4:12:27] <huskarl_zap> she want the poop dic
[4:12:28] <gryffinp> fun fact: these two were lovers
[4:12:32] <%kyh9> Oh yeah, that's her boyfriend
[4:12:34] <ElPlasa> husband and wife ntw
[4:12:37] <%kyh9> Imagine the sex
[4:12:39] <%dds333a> yop
[4:12:42] <@Menitta> YEAH ARAKUNE
[4:12:46] <%kyh9> Imagine the eldritch-insect horror bug sex
[4:12:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Litchi is the embodiment of "HOLY SHIT GET OVER IT"
[4:12:50] <ghilbor> childish killer is strangely appropriate here
[4:12:51] <%dds333a> @elplasa did they actually get together
[4:13:01] <Aganok_> is really is
[4:13:03] <%dds333a> the jin and tsubaki theme LUL
[4:13:08] <gryffinp> put that slime blob in furiten
[4:13:10] <BlackermanZX> you can stand on the staff
[4:13:19] <didgereedoodah> She was into him before the bug stuff to be fair
[4:13:22] <%keiji_maede> the lovers
[4:13:22] <mothdude> Remember when he only had to hit you once to curse you?
[4:13:22] <ElPlasa> @dds333a no clue LUL
[4:13:24] <%keiji_maede> lol
[4:13:24] <%baronblank> these are both kinda weird characters lol
[4:13:31] <+kinmarik> send all the bugs
[4:13:35] <Zerotoad5> He still only hits you once
[4:13:35] <%Shad0wTag> Litchi: I've come here to you cure Arakune: I don't want to be cured, I want to be eldritch bug slime monster
[4:13:37] <Reisadan> That staff is just full of evil intent
[4:13:38] <%Deft_Thought> Gotta build up curse with Arakune to really get to bug mode
[4:13:40] <gryffinp> hit him with the daisangen
[4:13:50] <%dds333a> @mothdude yup LUL
[4:13:56] <primaryfire> all of litchi's moves are named after mahjong hands
[4:14:06] <%dds333a> I remember litchi was sick in extend too
[4:14:07] <%townzzzzz> gotta full the bar
[4:14:08] <+Axle13j> Build up the curse meter with his D specials
[4:14:10] <%andrewofbob> Land D moves to fill the bar
[4:14:11] <gunstars20> gotta fill the curse bar with d Moves
[4:14:12] <NothuPlay> you need to fill the bar

[4:15:23] <gunstars20> No curse shenanigans today
[4:15:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BB Lore time: Arakune was originally a scientist named Roy Carmine, who ended up getting SEVERE Seithr (blazblue miasma) poisoning, basically making him a giant goo monster. He and Litchi were in a relationship before, and Litchi's one goal is to bring him back to normal.
[4:15:34] <%Shad0wTag> Ice Cars?

[4:16:04] <%kyh9> Like, I would NEVER be able to place the series these two motherfuckers come from, just based on art-style or design
[4:16:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah, this theme slaps
[4:16:36] <Aganok_> and they sure as hell don't belong together design-wise
[4:16:45] <%dds333a> yo
[4:16:46] <gryffinp> I never actually paid for jubei
