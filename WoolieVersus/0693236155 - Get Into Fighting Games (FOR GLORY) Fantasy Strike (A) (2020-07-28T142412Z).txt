[0:06:44] <%Josef_Stryker> Wait so how do they make money?
[0:06:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> offline local costs money though along with playing with friends.
[0:07:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Fighting games definitely should be cross-play as the standard
[0:07:08] <LoneFonte> also, GGPO
[0:07:17] <LVDoomien> hey guys look its the coolest character in Fantasy Strike
[0:08:10] <floralkami> the madlads included a guitar setup

[0:08:55] <Mrbaconator> pat dragon
[0:08:59] <+ggbhtg> his audio suddenly got very low?
[0:09:00] <%Josef_Stryker> Dragon Pat
[0:09:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> that game is loud
[0:09:07] <SomersaultJustice> his voice is really low
[0:09:08] <floralkami> manager-san is low
[0:09:09] <JohnnyContra> The game is still too loud
[0:09:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> nooo
[0:09:12] <+CharredChord> Turn up the call volume pls
[0:09:12] <%Solidnick18> pretty loud
[0:09:13] <%jiggy_snipe> his audio is low or game audio is too loud
[0:09:14] <+TheBesteban> The second I can travel to Montreal, I'm redoing your whole ghetto audio setup
[0:09:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> lower
[0:09:18] <+kewlmyc> Either turn him up or turn the game down
[0:09:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> much lower
[0:09:23] <HotMafia81> Game volume go up
[0:09:27] <SomersaultJustice> NOW KITH
[0:09:29] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:09:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh man
[0:09:36] <%Solidnick18> all good
[0:09:40] <+dmtjinni> you doing fine we love u
[0:09:41] <%LastHazzerd> game loud, guest voice low, woolie voice just fine
[0:09:44] <+Superbro64> blow out my ears more please Kreygasm
[0:09:59] <SymphonicMetalCitadel> Seems like guest volume and game volume went down and up together?
[0:10:02] <SomersaultJustice> TALL PAT
[0:10:05] <BaslerJones> Hey its pat
[0:10:10] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:10:12] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:10:24] <+gaemjurnalist> music kinda sounds like bloody tears
[0:10:27] <LVDoomien> yah Midori is like Grandmaster Pat
[0:10:33] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:10:42] <%PKSomething> Jump is a button?
[0:10:48] <+Triforce505> a to jump??
[0:10:52] <+Spinningrobo> jump button PogChamp
[0:11:21] <%BinaryFireball> Oh wait is this Sirlin?
[0:11:28] <KaironFortressKnight> yeah that's Ryu alright
[0:12:01] <+Spinningrobo> it's a weird thing though since sirlin has always been an advocate of using less complex inputs for moves where possible
[0:12:05] <NotHereToStream> geiger is guile pretty much
[0:12:08] <%Proxzo> Question: If I download on Switch, how's this game on WiFi?
[0:12:22] <JPU6400> its got rollback so itll be less booty than usual
[0:12:26] <+Spinningrobo> I remember him writing about how much he hated two button throws
[0:12:31] <MutedMimic> LUL
[0:12:35] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:12:38] <+dmtjinni> sick.....
[0:12:39] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:12:40] <%Proxzo> Any switch players?
[0:12:41] <%Josef_Stryker> Something something Za Warudo
[0:12:47] <%LastHazzerd> game still overpowering guest voice when moves are happening, for me at least
[0:12:53] <JPU6400> @Proxzo its crossplay
[0:13:01] <illTemperedSeaBass> I'm disappointed that Geiger doesn't have a German accent.
[0:13:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> @proxzo I'm downloading it right now so I'll let you know
[0:13:11] <%jiggy_snipe> yea the game overall is too loud to hear guest
[0:13:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, 20 bucks to play with friends online and to play local
[0:13:15] <%Proxzo> I should just try it out
[0:13:22] <%Proxzo> it's free to try
[0:13:25] <+SundanceShot> hit sparks communicating advantage/disadvantage is pretty cool
[0:13:34] <GPAlpha> Yeah, move sounds are a little loud
[0:13:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> for reference the switch port of Skullgirls didn't give me much problems on wireless and thats rollback too
[0:13:58] <JPU6400> why isnt the game taking up the full viewport?
[0:13:58] <%PKSomething> that's cool
[0:14:15] <%PKSomething> the audio in this game is really crunchy
[0:14:35] <+Mendin> Does Geiger still have the Air-Pause to let him jump forward and regain charge?
[0:14:46] <floralkami> yes
[0:15:20] <+Psycosis> does reggie like Valerie because FEET?
[0:15:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
