[0:11:56] <+TenguGemini> i am super excited to see Kamiya's take on Ultraman
[0:11:56] <dustingV> Off topic: has there been a stream where it was min and Reggie with no woolie?
[0:12:16] <+NotHereToStream> don't think so, woolie's been pretty much in everything
[0:12:22] <Xeroflame> then it wouldnt be woolievs
[0:13:02] <MayorRev> *hacker voice* I'm in.
[0:15:20] <black_pariah> that particular enemy was what i was worried about in terms of mihn's vision issue
[0:15:25] <YaminoRaiden> Wait, is he color blind?
[0:15:33] <%tearfuldevil> yep
[0:15:33] <Solidnick18> yes
[0:15:38] <%tearfuldevil> r/g, iirc
[0:15:43] <%tearfuldevil> dunno the more precise term
[0:15:47] <black_pariah> its gonna be difficult for him to fight that guy
[0:15:49] <YaminoRaiden> Fuck
[0:16:05] <arikk42> we should have started on GOD HAND
[0:16:23] <+libra_zero> "Destroy the Unknown" is a SICK way to introduce a boss fight
[0:16:46] <+TenguGemini> i want platinum to make a spiritual successor to God Hand more than almost anything
[0:16:53] <black_pariah> actually hes killing it i was worried for nothing
[0:17:15] <+TenguGemini> or for capcom to release God Hand on a modern system
[0:17:19] <Tucker0603> holy shit
[0:17:23] <+TenguGemini> with or without HD visuals
[0:17:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> pog
[0:17:51] <+nekodelic> which type of colorblindness does he have?
[0:18:02] <%tearfuldevil> red and green?

[0:18:08] <+libra_zero> driving in general?

[0:18:21] <%ozzrabbit> Salt party
[0:18:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:25] <+TenguGemini> Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo?
[0:18:41] <+nekodelic> there are four types of red/green colorblindness @tearknack
[0:18:48] <YaminoRaiden> Woolie abusing his disabled friends
[0:19:05] <unagiboy> hello uhh woolieversus crew
[0:19:08] <%tearfuldevil> yeah i'm aware, but he's never mentioned in detail so Kappa
[0:19:35] <Tucker0603> wish this game would work on my computer for some reason it doesn't :/
[0:19:36] <Bamcc2> Sup everyone o/
[0:20:20] <joylent_blue> lmao
[0:20:31] <%jiggy_snipe> he's got Naruto eyes
[0:21:44] <+TenguGemini> so this game looks rad as hell
[0:22:03] <+TenguGemini> why haven't i seen people talk about this much until this rerelease?
[0:22:39] <%tearfuldevil> its a shooter by platinum that didn't sell that well
[0:22:57] <arikk42> @WoolieVersus How's Shadow of the Dammed ?
[0:23:10] <artoflec> This game is rad, why haven't I heard about it is basically what Platinum Games is
[0:23:10] <joylent_blue> it doesn't tutorialize the player very effectively so a lot of people who played it didn't realize all the stuff you can do
[0:23:19] <+TenguGemini> ah
[0:23:22] <+TenguGemini> that'll do it
[0:23:23] <joylent_blue> so they just filed it under "eh, just another cover shooter"
[0:23:37] <mephium> is it more muted I guess?
[0:23:44] <OrosBlueberries> shadows of the damned was dumb as hell but a lot of fun
[0:23:44] <artoflec> people needed their hand helds like crazy during this gen, nobody knew how to experiment and learn themselves.
[0:23:46] <+nekodelic> woolie doesn't understand colorblindness LUL
[0:23:50] <%tearfuldevil> casual fans of platinum games didn't care cause it was a shooter, shooter fans didn't care cause it was a platinum game, other people didn't care because it sold badly
[0:24:00] <primaryfire> there's a green shell in mario kart?
[0:24:04] <arikk42> i played Vanquish as one of the first PS3 games, and i had a fucking blast
[0:24:16] <Solidnick18> interesting
[0:24:19] <+TenguGemini> important question: what color is peanut butter to you?
[0:24:19] <arikk42> and i only played DMC3-4
[0:24:20] <%jiggy_snipe> interesting
[0:24:36] <+TenguGemini> my brother learned in his 20s that peanut butter is NOT green
[0:25:09] <joylent_blue> LUL
[0:25:23] <black_pariah> as someone who played this for the first time recently, i knew everything was green red and gray so i was super surprised woolie gave minh the controls
[0:25:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:25:30] <Solidnick18> OH nooo
[0:25:31] <+nekodelic> my cousin can't differentiate blue from purple because his eyes can't process the "red"in purple
[0:25:41] <YaminoRaiden> What.The. Hell?: o
[0:26:00] <Dingo_Eejit> Only NOW are we discussing the actual impact of Minh's colour blindness. wow
[0:27:00] <arikk42> i never would have guessed that this game was so niche
[0:27:14] <black_pariah> reverse the polarity is such a 2000s game objective
[0:27:15] <%jiggy_snipe> alot Platinum's stuff is niche
[0:27:26] <YaminoRaiden> Whenever I have an awakening of enlightenment, Giorno's piano plays
[0:27:53] <am_omega> I can't wait for Platinum's Ultraman game.
[0:28:31] <Solidnick18> project a go-go Kreygasm
[0:28:32] <arikk42> Yeah, i discovered God Hand so late but i will play it today while waiting for this Game to arrive
[0:28:38] <+NekoNinja13> is that real @am_omega
[0:28:52] <am_omega> Their latest trailer was Ultraman as fuck.
[0:29:02] <arikk42> and then W101 which i will pay up 40K Yen this Saturday
[0:29:13] <OrosBlueberries> I have god hand on my ps2's hard drive but haven't cracked it open yet. I might as well do that tonight
[0:29:15] <%ChoculaUltra> don't listen to them Minh, keep going till you drop. Fuck recovery.
[0:29:16] <+NekoNinja13> new ultraman or classic ultraman?
[0:29:17] <joylent_blue> their independent project had a teaser trailer drop the other day
[0:29:26] <$masneo2> geez makes me wanna whip out the ps3 and play this again...
[0:29:32] <mephium> it looks like ultraman I guess
[0:29:34] <am_omega> Dunno as I know very little about Ultraman.
[0:29:34] <joylent_blue> interested to see what they go for
[0:29:49] <am_omega> If you are familiar go watch the trailer.
[0:29:56] <am_omega> Project G.G.
[0:29:59] <arikk42> My PS3 next to me, asking me to play God Hand again
[0:30:09] <+NekoNinja13> was ultraman giant or human size?
[0:30:14] <am_omega> Giant.
[0:30:19] <joylent_blue> big giant
[0:30:19] <black_pariah> i saw GG and thought of Gridman
[0:30:23] <am_omega> Was human sized.
[0:30:28] <$masneo2> the shinji mikami passion projects
[0:30:34] <am_omega> Saved doggo and went Giant.
[0:30:44] <%ChoculaUltra> psst, Gridman is just an anime adaptation of Ultraman btw.
[0:30:53] <%Javaa01> At worst, the fire forces an overheat
[0:31:11] <arikk42> what this Ultraman game everyone talking about
[0:31:14] <arikk42> ?
[0:31:24] <+NekoNinja13> okay I know very little aswell about ultraman, but I know the new ultraman is basically iron man instead of kaiju sized
[0:31:24] <black_pariah> the new platinum game
[0:31:25] <am_omega> Platinum showed off a new trailer.
[0:31:35] <am_omega> Its Ultraman as fuck.
[0:31:40] <%Javaa01> It's the next project Kamiya is working on
[0:31:43] <chambatron> Has it been confirmed it's Ultraman or not yet?
[0:31:53] <am_omega> Its probably not Ultraman.
[0:31:56] <arikk42> ok, i'll check the traielr
[0:32:00] <am_omega> But inspired.
[0:32:00] <chambatron> I mean I saw the trailer but it could not be the smae IP right?
[0:32:02] <%ChoculaUltra> if you remember a live-action show called Super Human Samurai Cyber-Squad you actually just watched a dubbed version of an Ultraman spin-off.
[0:32:07] <%Javaa01> Basically to Ultraman what W101 was to Tokusatsu
[0:32:10] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:32:19] <chambatron> Yeah that's what I thought
[0:32:22] <$masneo2> i wonder if shinji mikami really wanted to make resident evil 4 like this lol jk
[0:32:51] <chambatron> Altho if they got the right to make an Ultraman game tho OWLonfire OWLonfire

[1:06:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> the bicc boiss
[1:06:54] <%RioGascar> I get that the game slows down time when your crit injured. but i wish you could cancel it out so you are forced to wait for the suit power to recharge
[1:07:13] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The backslide PogChamp
[1:07:15] <%RioGascar> So you arent
[1:07:17] <OrosBlueberries> sick
[1:07:18] <APB_Harleqyn> Someone warn Twitch, Minh is showing his BALLS!
[1:07:27] <artoflec> yeah the auto slow down on near death is something i would change for a sequel
[1:07:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> that tail stab reminds me of that one bayo enemy. the dog looking ones
[1:07:53] <valriot> @artoflec Vanquish sequel LUL LUL LUL doodSad doodSad doodSad doodSad
[1:08:01] <+hoenhime344> i disagree. with how hectic the game is, it is meant as a BIG crutch for you to get your barings
[1:08:09] <%RioGascar> a sequel for this or just TAKING all the mechanics and putting in another...well more interesting levels would make it work better
[1:08:18] <%Javaa01> The Pistol is too good to pass up
[1:08:35] <%RioGascar> @hoenhime344 I get that but maybe allow the player to turn off slow mo usage so it doesn’t drain it fully
[1:09:00] <+hoenhime344> @RioGascar but that is punishment for being bad
[1:09:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:09:16] <dukenux> If he lives, he lives.
[1:09:21] <%RioGascar> I tried replaying this some more and a issue i ran into was...god the levels and design is so damn boring and generic
[1:09:45] <pshuuu> the setting is great but the levels are samey, yea
[1:09:45] <+hoenhime344> taht i agree with. the level design is something to work on
[1:09:58] <%RioGascar> the gameplay being moved to more interesting game or locations makes it dull
[1:10:21] <%RioGascar> the setting is not utalized at all
[1:10:34] <%RioGascar> we are in a giant space station...yet we never feel like it
[1:10:39] <+hoenhime344> bu the enemy design and weapons and cheeky tone and all the game play mechanics just work so beautifully im willing to excuse the boring leves.
[1:11:10] <artoflec> i dont realyl find the levels boring, they're good areas for fighting. I guess visually distinct but that's low priority if you're gonna go for immersion over gameplay.
[1:11:22] <%ChoculaUltra> the hard knock down to set up the 50/50 mixups?!
[1:11:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> To be fair, I don't think a space station would look fancy and different with every district or area
[1:11:45] <%RioGascar> it would be split up like a real city
[1:11:54] <+hoenhime344> take away the textures. and you are left with a floor with some chest high boxes and a balcony for 90% of tyhe game
[1:12:00] <%RioGascar> like policenauts had the residental sections
[1:12:15] <pshuuu> the forest area could have had bigger trees used for cover for example
[1:12:21] <pshuuu> but it just reuses the same barricdaes
[1:12:24] <+hoenhime344> imagine an ampatheater, or moving gears, or a whirlpool
[1:12:54] <+hoenhime344> hell even a space 0 gravity section
[1:13:05] <%RioGascar> the cheeky tone does help but i can see why this did get a jim sterling score out of 10
[1:13:17] <+hoenhime344> use the boost to zip around in a straight line like deadspace
[1:13:34] <%RioGascar> if this got a sequel i’d focus on levels and aesthetic
[1:13:37] <Reizie_Etherealm> If anything I think the same enemy being reused throughout the game is the real turnoff for me
[1:13:39] <Tucker0603> slap that anus
[1:13:42] <joylent_blue> lmfao minh
[1:13:49] <sototsiris> let em know
[1:13:51] <artoflec> i dunno, levels aren't visually distinct enough but everything else is aces doesn't deserve a low score
[1:13:55] <zenith0111> YO VANQUISH
[1:13:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> God Damn, Minh
[1:14:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> Guys and mechs, girls and panzer
[1:14:14] <+Proxzo> What did the five fingers say to the [redacted]
[1:14:51] <%RioGascar> if the levels boring and the player doesnt feel motivated with cool levels or interesting design i dont blame em for dropping the game. the music is also kinda weak
[1:15:22] <%RioGascar> Okay i think i know this games issue: non gameplay based production values are too law
[1:15:24] <%RioGascar> *low
[1:15:25] <%tearfuldevil> yeah this game visually and musically is very bleh so far
[1:15:40] <pshuuu> that seems to always be a problem with plat games tbh
[1:15:42] <%tearfuldevil> the story is also a bunch of nothing
[1:15:43] <artoflec> graphics over gameplay elaWeird
[1:15:45] <%RioGascar> gameplay is polished as fuck but everything else is ignored or an after thought
[1:16:01] <%ChoculaUltra> the seemingly constant sepia tone over everything on some levels, like this one, don't help the blander aspects either.
[1:16:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[1:16:02] <%netrac> If the player isn't impressed by the gameplay then there is nothing else true
[1:16:04] <Daxalog> I have to be honest. The only thing keeping me playing this game at this point was the chance at another cool QTE. I ddint get past forest zone.
[1:16:08] <%RioGascar> Its not just graphics
[1:16:11] <Reizie_Etherealm> I don't mind the environment cause when you play well and just keep moving along, you don't have time to dwell on how bland everything is
[1:16:18] <%ChoculaUltra> it gets really noticeable when you slow time and the color filter gets removed.
[1:16:21] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:16:26] <%tearfuldevil> i would never have even thought about buying this game anywhere near like, five or so years within release
[1:16:36] <%tearfuldevil> cause at the time i had no idea who platinum was
[1:17:05] <%tearfuldevil> and i didn't have any interest in 3rd person shooters
[1:17:06] <Daxalog> "WHATS A PLATINUM?" - 15 year old me
[1:17:18] <valriot> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:17:27] <zenith0111> I played the shit put of the demo back in the day
[1:17:31] <%RioGascar> that is a pretty large problem with platinum games in general. they dont make a large effort to make their depth known and let the player do it
[1:17:42] <Reizie_Etherealm> I really respect games that has absurdly constrasting enviornment in each level that the story need to be contrived to explain how and why you're in that area
[1:17:44] <Daxalog> Also my Math Teacher almost talked me out of buying this game cause it didnt have multiplayer.
[1:17:49] <%Ipsenscastle> @zenith0111 same, that was a rad demo
[1:17:50] <Digsby> This is a rerelease right? How's it compare to the PC version?
[1:17:57] <black_pariah> crystal viper is no joke
[1:17:57] <MayorRev> your math teacher a lil bitch
[1:18:00] <%RioGascar> like dmc5 doesnt reveal all its cards but it gives you snippets of ideas
[1:18:06] <%ChoculaUltra> your math teacher should stick to math.
[1:18:32] <pshuuu> you dont get any i-frames on dodge during overheat, right?
[1:18:33] <%netrac> Nah DMC explains jack shit about it's high level gameplay
[1:18:39] <pshuuu> thats why melee is so weak
[1:18:48] <%RioGascar> And dmc5’s levels are also pretty “generic” looking. Just varys stuff up enough to not get bland
[1:18:48] <Tucker0603> REALLY MINH
[1:18:51] <%Ecchigun> Minh with the biggest plays
[1:18:55] <black_pariah> crystal viper took damn near all my ammo
[1:18:55] <%ChoculaUltra> oh man, that takes me back to the whole 360/PS3 era where people legit argued that games without multiplayer aspects were not worth the price.
[1:19:00] <zenith0111> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:19:01] <Daxalog> Remember guys this was back in the days of "If this game dosnt have multiplayer, why bother?" was the main thought of lots of people back in the day
[1:19:03] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:19:08] <+hoenhime344> amem

[1:19:19] <Belutima> Beta Cheater woopsKek
[1:19:24] <artoflec> and i really dont think it matters in DMC5 either because they're well designed areas. Where i've played more games that visually vary things up, but they're bad levels.
[1:19:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> The REAL Black Swordsman
[1:19:27] <%RioGascar> @daxalog I thought this was prior to this? Like most games STILL had a campaign
[1:19:28] <JetpackMcQuack> Mihn doesn't lose twice
[1:19:28] <+hoenhime344> if the game allows it. exploit the SHIT outta it
[1:19:35] <%tearfuldevil> i mean you joke but multiplayer IS a huge value add to a game
[1:19:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> you're getting blown up
[1:20:06] <%ChoculaUltra> don't get me wrong, multiplayer is a huge aspect in gaming but not every fucking game NEEDS to be multiplayer to be worth a play.
[1:20:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> Uh oh
[1:20:08] <Professor_Rakor> Is'nt he even before beta's tho? He's a tester who is a cheater...
[1:20:11] <cyberblueneon> devil may cry 1 has the best looking areas in the series
[1:20:13] <%tearfuldevil> why spend 60 dollars on a game you'll play once, and not 60 dollars on a game you can play forever with your friends
[1:20:27] <JetpackMcQuack> A teater @Professor_Rakor
[1:20:31] <%Ipsenscastle> DMC5 has at least 50% awesome looking levels
[1:20:31] <black_pariah> WOOLIE THIS IS FOOLISHNESS
[1:20:34] <%tearfuldevil> oof, teater
[1:20:44] <%Ipsenscastle> that's not a bad hit rate for the series
[1:20:50] <pshuuu> stood there like a lemon
[1:20:51] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie got him killed
[1:20:51] <%Ecchigun> wow woolie
[1:20:54] <%Ecchigun> bullied minh
[1:20:57] <+hoenhime344> woool...
[1:20:57] <%Javaa01> Only once he rushes you with melee
[1:20:57] <artoflec> i just think if the worst thing you can say about a game is that its visuals are samey, that's a platinum star game.
[1:20:57] <%Irridium> "keep your distance" *gets right up at him*

[1:21:12] <+hoenhime344> @artoflec hole heartedly disagree
[1:21:19] <+Manderson1998> captain Manhattan looking ass
[1:21:30] <zenith0111> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:21:32] <%netrac> In replay heavy games I tend to care very little about the levels visuals
[1:21:33] <artoflec> @hoenhime344 ?? so you'd take a technical mess over, ah this area looks samey
[1:21:33] <pixel_river> QTE in this always worth
[1:21:38] <%tearfuldevil> DMC5 doesn't have super unique level looks a lot of the time, but the production value is high, and the actual elvel design is good
[1:21:40] <%Ipsenscastle> I do find Vanquish fatiguing to look at in the same way as RE6 though. All the assets look like the same box at different sizes
[1:21:41] <+hoenhime344> IMO all the enemy are VERY distinctive from each other
[1:21:43] <Reizie_Etherealm> OOOOH
[1:21:44] <%jiggy_snipe> OOOOOOO

[1:22:18] <Digsby> Jesus the shotgun damage
[1:22:20] <%jiggy_snipe> damn did em like Robocop
[1:22:28] <%RioGascar> re6 does vary up its levels massively. gameplay as well.
[1:22:30] <%tearfuldevil> but yeah, this is the first non-boss enemy design in the game i've found interesting
[1:22:31] <+badjab326> He Did Q's super!
[1:22:32] <morow1ec> We did it. We saved the city
[1:22:38] <%Javaa01> Oops
[1:22:40] <dukenux> S U C C
[1:22:52] <%tearfuldevil> or was it a boss?
[1:22:53] <primaryfire> GAIA
[1:22:53] <artoflec> i saw Pat stream RE6 for like 4 hours, there wasn't a single good area.
[1:23:00] <+hoenhime344> @artoflec no i mean about the enemys looking samey. i think they all have varied silhouette and moves and animations
[1:23:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> it had a boss health bar

[1:23:08] <dukenux> the other bonus of this, is that reminds me of Policenauts LP
[1:23:17] <Solidnick18> a HOLE
[1:23:18] <%tearfuldevil> A HOLE
[1:23:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think the enemy design in this is pretty good.
[1:23:29] <dukenux> OH MY GOD JC, A HOLE
[1:23:30] <Professor_Rakor> Sorry, I can't hear you through the gruff.
[1:23:33] <artoflec> @hoenhime344 oh, yeah they definitely do.
[1:23:37] <kvassimoto> A DUD?
[1:23:47] <%RioGascar> wait why doesnt the station AUTOMATICALLY close the hole?
[1:23:52] <%ironohki> I just got here what's this game about.
[1:23:55] <pixel_river> cool level ahead
[1:24:02] <artoflec> enemy design being varied up in a whiteboxed game is more important
[1:24:12] <zenith0111> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:24:24] <%jiggy_snipe> "efficient"
[1:24:25] <Clausible_Pause> I much prefer gruff military man one over gruff military man 2.
[1:24:26] <dukenux> Be polite, be efficient
[1:24:27] <%RioGascar> We can argue about what’s important to make a good game
[1:24:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Pat is giving a thumbs up in the distance
[1:24:36] <%RioGascar> but at end of the day if games not fun
[1:24:37] <%ironohki> Roll roll roll. Is this Zelda?
[1:24:39] <%RioGascar> why bother
[1:24:42] <%ironohki> Or dark souls?
[1:24:52] <dukenux> It's Slide Souls
[1:24:56] <%ironohki> Sweet.
[1:24:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> I agree with that sentiment
[1:24:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> the dark souls of third person shooters
[1:24:58] <Tucker0603> WHY NO BOOST? T^T
[1:24:59] <pixel_river> Pog
[1:25:00] <joylent_blue> the game is about cool slowmo flips and HYPE SHIT
[1:25:07] <%netrac> I'ts actually Picross.
[1:25:10] <+Manderson1998> @ironohki Russian after a coup boils San Francisco alive with a colony space laser so American sends the space force to take it down
[1:25:12] <+hoenhime344> this game is about praising Platinum games
[1:25:16] <%RioGascar> i wish we got more of this part
[1:25:23] <artoflec> i think you'd have to go into this game and convince yourself to be bored to not find some fun in this
[1:25:28] <pixel_river> we galaxy
[1:25:41] <%ironohki> Got it.
[1:25:46] <Clausible_Pause> Fun can be a different thing for different people sometimes. I unironically loved Deadly Premonition and a lot of people think that game is dogshit.
[1:25:47] <+hoenhime344> see this is a cool level
[1:25:49] <%RioGascar> i dont think this changes anything
[1:26:01] <%RioGascar> i see we played dead space
[1:26:03] <dukenux> i can only assume the armor was outfitted with ass magnets
[1:26:09] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:26:10] <%tearfuldevil> i probably would have been overwhelmed and/or not noticed all the platinumy, non shootery stuff by this game
[1:26:18] <+Manderson1998> man remember Inversion
[1:26:24] <%RioGascar> No
[1:26:30] <stranger59> Niiice
[1:26:30] <zenith0111> Kreygasm PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:26:31] <pshuuu> all the cool stoff is pretty optional tbh
[1:26:32] <%RioGascar> Remember dead space?
[1:26:35] <artoflec> i think deadly premonition is fun in a weird way yeah, or like how just talking to people in yakuza is fun.
[1:26:35] <%tearfuldevil> and would have jsut thought it was an okay to bad 3rd person shooter, with a hokey storey
[1:26:36] <%ChoculaUltra> come to think of it, ZoE2 had some preeeeeetty ass level environments too but cot damn is the gameplay tight af.
[1:26:53] <%sleepy_coffee> Aww ye the stream baby is here!
[1:26:55] <primaryfire> deadly premonition is fun in spite of its gameplay, not because of it
[1:26:56] <kvassimoto> that as is so big it has it's own gravity field
[1:26:56] <pshuuu> the cool stuff is actually pretty ineffective. you just die if you use melee most of the time
[1:27:24] <pshuuu> this level is pretty awesome
[1:27:26] <artoflec> yeah the path to learning how to use it well is part of the fun
[1:27:30] <%tearfuldevil> i will say that when i actually blayed this game, i didn't think it was that amazing? it was fun, but not amazingly so
[1:27:31] <%RioGascar> i think they should have let you do 0-G slow mo shit in this level
[1:27:41] <stranger59> Skynet is sending more Terminators the past
[1:27:42] <black_pariah> at a certain point mihn just needs to shoot
[1:27:49] <%RioGascar> As it is, 0-g feels like it doesn’t affect anything or change the game
[1:28:05] <+hoenhime344> best level design goes to Darksouls 1. hands down. that game is like mc escher's stairs
[1:28:06] <%ironohki> These are some pretty nifty robot space mans in space corridors. Ia this Warframe?
[1:28:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> This area reminds me of "what disgusting new space fetishes are we- oh really?"
[1:28:19] <%tearfuldevil> as was mentioned, most of the cool stuff in this game, at least at the level of skill i have (none) is not as effective as just doing normal cover shooting
[1:28:19] <%RioGascar> Like sams slide leads to him being UNABLE to stop his slide so he goes into heavy melee
[1:28:26] <artoflec> I think 50% of dark souls 1 has good level design yeah, the other half is rafters and lost izalith and bullshit
[1:28:42] <%netrac> This game has the problem that playing it lame is really effective.
[1:28:46] <%tearfuldevil> yeah
[1:28:52] <Solidnick18> YYEYE
[1:28:55] <+hoenhime344> @tearknack then you have not been paying attention lol. if you treat this like Gears you will have a bad time
[1:28:57] <pshuuu> yeah i played it lame first time through, just use ARS for slomo
[1:28:59] <Ledsagar> mizkifYo YO WOOLIE AND CHAT
[1:28:59] <Solidnick18> Rip and tear
[1:29:01] <%ironohki> Izalith is such a sadness, that they never could actually finish it.
[1:29:05] <%Ecchigun> STUN LOCKED
[1:29:14] <%RioGascar> And a sequel would hopefully fix this issues for a vanquish 2
[1:29:16] <artoflec> yeah but why would you just spam stinger that's boring.
[1:29:17] <%Ecchigun> EZ
[1:29:18] <Tucker0603> still find it heresy that they ain't giving the boost mg love
[1:29:18] <%Ecchigun> PZ
[1:29:23] <%jiggy_snipe> stun locked and corner trapped
[1:29:25] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that's a good take. The game actually kinda rewards you for playing as lame as possible.
[1:29:29] <pshuuu> well you cant spam stinger in this game,. you just die if you do that
[1:29:36] <pshuuu> so you have to covershoot and flip slomo
[1:29:36] <%netrac> I dislike dukes more than izalith
[1:29:36] <%RioGascar> cause yeah the game itself DOES NOT PUNISH and in fact ENCOURAGES you to lame it out
[1:29:41] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:29:46] <pshuuu> i guess you can spam disc tho LUL
[1:29:52] <Ledsagar> any mizkifEgg ers
[1:30:09] <joylent_blue> that emote disturbs me
[1:30:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:30:13] <%tearfuldevil> @hoenhime344 i've never played gears, so I couldn't "treat it as gears", but I found just doing normal cover shooting was waaaay more effective than ever trying to do cool stuff, when i played it last year
[1:30:16] <artoflec> i dont know i think its why cover shooters are mostly dead now, people realized that shit's boring.
[1:30:26] <%RioGascar> i would probably have cover get damaged, give you more health, HAVE GLORY KILL system to incentivize GOING IN
[1:30:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dukenux
[1:30:33] <Ledsagar> LUL
[1:30:44] <pshuuu> i think it just needed to not make melee make you overheat
[1:30:47] <biomegabear> The moral dilemma of army men
[1:30:47] <+hoenhime344> if you say so, from my experience if you treat it like a lame cover shooter, you are going to die. alot
[1:30:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> "There's still time" "THERE'S NO TIME"
[1:30:55] <pshuuu> maybe even reduce the heat when doing melee
[1:30:57] <pshuuu> like MGR
[1:30:58] <dukenux> id be very surprised if you dont get too fight Boomer Phoenix
[1:30:59] <%tearfuldevil> i had the exact opposite experience
[1:31:01] <%ChoculaUltra> oh man, destroyable cover would've made this game a lot more intuitive with what the player is capable of.
[1:31:02] <artoflec> yeah most of the harder enemies have energy attacks that ignore cover, and enemies flank like crazy
[1:31:03] <Professor_Rakor> How can we fight gruff of this magnitude...
[1:31:12] <artoflec> and a lot of the cover DOES blow up
[1:31:19] <joylent_blue> gruff steve blum yelling
[1:31:25] <%netrac> A health regen system like DOOM 2016 would encourage more active combat
[1:31:32] <%RioGascar> Also it doesn’t help that I absolutely hate this character and WANT TO SHOOT HIM
[1:31:33] <%CoronetChris> Necessary collateral damage
[1:31:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sam's face is just covered in spit after that
[1:31:39] <biomegabear> Theres alot of army rules about NOT DOING THIS TO YOUR TROOPS
[1:31:44] <%tearfuldevil> ye
[1:31:49] <pshuuu> yeah, add a MGR spine grab system after melee kills that restore some health and heat
[1:31:51] <%RioGascar> MANY WAR CRIMES
[1:31:52] <pshuuu> thatd be awesome
[1:31:55] <Kristoffers> this is why you send Samus in ALONE
[1:31:59] <%ChoculaUltra> I know the vehicles and debris that can be used as cover can get blown up, but the static ass chest high boxes seem invulnerable
[1:32:03] <+hoenhime344> @ChoculaUltra there IS destroy able cover when lasers or large rockets hit cover after 3-5 time cover explodes. cept for the when the cover is the level itself
[1:32:04] <stranger59> Do you feel like a hero yet?
[1:32:05] <%jiggy_snipe> those are big war crimes
[1:32:08] <cyberblueneon> i dont like doom combat because there is no dodge or block mchanic
[1:32:08] <+wjones0415> wow so fuck the UCMJ I guess.

[1:33:25] <%RioGascar> like if platinum wants players to fully utilize the games ideas they need to incentivize it. less cover, more health, faster movement, glory kill system, etc
[1:33:43] <biomegabear> Mihn maxed out all his weapons?
[1:33:45] <%sleepy_coffee> woolieMIRIN
[1:33:46] <%RioGascar> maybe have kills with STYLE lower your heat
[1:33:50] <+hoenhime344> @ChoculaUltra i mean idk man, it was 2010. lol asking alot for a scene to morph terrain... even now adays tahts asking alot
[1:33:57] <%tearfuldevil> yeah
[1:33:58] <%RioGascar> So your goal is to be stylish as fuck SO YOU DONT OVERHEAT
[1:33:58] <artoflec> all games need to do to incentivize me to interact with mechanics is make them fun, and platinum does that.
[1:34:05] <Kristoffers> Can't fret over every space egg, jack!
[1:34:05] <stranger59> Glory kills to encourage chaining kills would be nice.
[1:34:06] <+badjab326> lol Mihn Maxed
[1:34:09] <zenith0111> Or style kills give more heat
[1:34:14] <%Irridium> what if sacrifices needed to be made to get sick mecha
[1:34:16] <zenith0111> Do more shit
[1:34:20] <%RioGascar> this game does not incentivize
[1:34:21] <%tearfuldevil> what if they sacrifice a monster to summon a nother one face down in defense position
[1:34:24] <dukenux> Space War Economy
[1:34:26] <+jbfelder> Worst is when they say "unnecessary sacrifice"
[1:34:27] <%ChoculaUltra> @hoenhime344 that's fair. It's games like this that make you appreciate what we had for the era/time.
[1:34:29] <%tearfuldevil> i would love to hear that
[1:34:36] <Belutima> Someone did say TREAR nukes like Bullets, in sacrificing us cities to take out commie cities woopsSweat

[1:35:00] <Prevot> used to be a Russian?

[1:35:05] <Solidnick18> reggie still doesn't trust the russians
[1:35:06] <xXxPS9xXx> bet reggie would have no problem sacrificing russia

[1:35:32] <artoflec> yeah in 2010 what incentivized me to play this game right was that it wasn't all the other bland boring cover shooters that were everywhere.

[1:35:45] <+Proxzo> Reggi's racism killed Minh
[1:35:53] <Shardlab> Dammit, Reggie!!
[1:35:54] <+nekodelic> imagine a free country talking about sacrifice yet sending people to war zones for the sake of that sweet oil money
[1:35:57] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus no, by the deepness of their dab
[1:35:58] <+liquidzr0> tokenb3Handrub spicy
[1:35:59] <%ChoculaUltra> that being said, imagine Vanquish with the MGS Revengeance engine/gameplay? Platinum could take my bank routing number.
[1:36:34] <+hoenhime344> not even todays games have a model for every rocket and bullet thrown at you AND let you interact with the projectiles in ways that affect the battle
[1:36:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reggie's the kind the toss a job application if tbe name on it is a little too
[1:36:37] <stranger59> -ovich's get stitches
[1:36:39] <dj_arashi_rora> What Thomas?
[1:36:40] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie would be in favor of internment camps sbfpBleetz
[1:36:41] <%RioGascar> @artoflec But it had the same cover system, a lot of cover, low health, aggressive as fuck enemies and lots of hit scan weapons used against you and not many projectile based weapons

[1:37:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[1:37:18] <artoflec> @RioGascar and it had ways to overcome all of that just by having fun learning. There are ways to deal critical hits to enemies for example where you can kill them super fast.
[1:37:20] <biomegabear> Ends in a V you get no D
[1:37:43] <dukenux> that's right, his secret was an irish birth certificate
[1:37:46] <%RioGascar> And yet again game actively allows you to lame it out
[1:37:59] <%RioGascar> The dominant strategy of this game is lame out
[1:38:05] <pshuuu> the most effective way to deal crit hits is still to just roll out of cover and slomo
[1:38:06] <%RioGascar> the easiest and most effective solution
[1:38:11] <artoflec> @RioGascar but that would be my choice to play in a boring way, i didn't want to play in a boring way. Other games didn't let me play in a non-boring way.
[1:38:14] <+NekoNinja13> people are really overly critical of this game
[1:38:30] <dukenux> Press B to Agressive
[1:38:31] <pshuuu> nah its just 1 discussion here
[1:38:37] <+hoenhime344> idk man, RioGascar...i completely disagree. maybe we just have different ways of looking at game intent
[1:38:43] <Solidnick18> He did
[1:38:47] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:39:01] <%RioGascar> i mean its a good ass game it just is kinda for a niche when the mainstream is gonna always go for the easiest strategy
[1:39:15] <+NekoNinja13> it's not perfect, but it's not am abomination to action games
[1:39:16] <pshuuu> yea its still the best TPS there is
[1:39:19] <pshuuu> but there just are these issues
[1:39:23] <%RioGascar> theres way to encourage not hiding in cover
[1:39:30] <%RioGascar> doom and max payne did it
[1:39:32] <primaryfire> I don't like it at all for several reasons and most of them pertain to mediocre gunplay, slowmo and the suit overheat, but I still enjoy the playthru
[1:39:39] <jaygee303> How long is this game?
[1:39:50] <%RioGascar> About 6-8 hre
[1:40:05] <%tearfuldevil> you think we'll finish this stream?
[1:40:15] <%RioGascar> at least if im going off my steam play through
[1:40:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> Minh panicking noises*
[1:40:25] <pshuuu> this is the 3rd stream, right? probably another one
[1:40:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> Uh oh
[1:41:28] <%RioGascar> if anything i think this game biggest issue is its heating system
[1:41:30] <+hoenhime344> its around 6-8
[1:41:47] <Equirah> free sniper rank up right there
[1:41:49] <%RioGascar> doing cool shit doesnt make it cool down or let you get more slow mo
[1:41:57] <artoflec> if they had a system of destroying parts or headshots refilling your heat meter i'd love it more.
[1:42:06] <pshuuu> then itd be perfect tbh
[1:42:08] <%RioGascar> max payne if you do good it does give you more slow mo to use
[1:42:26] <+hoenhime344> only thing i would change in the heating sytem, is then when you land a melee move you should be able to active reload your cooling.
[1:42:37] <artoflec> yeah, Nioh ki pulse for your cooling
[1:42:46] <%RioGascar> sure maybe a gears of war style active cool
[1:42:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> This game is 3 years before platinum invented the zandatsu system
[1:42:52] <Daxalog> What is the context for pro game move?
[1:42:54] <+hoenhime344> but waiting for the long cooldown when you almost die is a punishment i think is worthy
[1:42:56] <Talionshadow1138> using cover in Vanquish :D
[1:43:12] <%RioGascar> and it does make you feel powerless
[1:43:17] <primaryfire> auto slowmo when you're at low health is really lame imo
[1:43:21] <+nekodelic> are we complaining about how this game gives you freedom to play in different ways while giving you the tools to play stylish and encouraging that with a score system?
[1:43:23] <primaryfire> especially because it forces you to overheat
[1:43:33] <%RioGascar> like how crysis 2 makes you feel like dead weight when the suit shutdowns
[1:43:39] <%ironohki> Reminds me how lasers in Warframe all suck but I love them anyway.
[1:44:07] <Talionshadow1138> I still think 1 melee into overheat is harsh, especially considering all the cool melee attacks you can do in this game
[1:44:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> I agree with that ^
[1:44:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:44:17] <Talionshadow1138> but this game is still hype
[1:44:19] <+hoenhime344> @ironohki have you build a laser kit gun? cuz that shit is deff NOT lame
[1:44:21] <%RioGascar> @nekodelic No we are criticizing how it doesn’t effectively utalize its cool ideas and limits them
[1:44:41] <%ironohki> Never got into kitguns. Could be a fun project to get me back in.
[1:44:42] <artoflec> it effectively utilizes them in most ways though for sure.
[1:44:49] <Solidnick18> yeah
[1:44:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> For sure for sure for sure
[1:44:54] <+nekodelic> @RioGascar how?
[1:45:15] <+nekodelic> just got here, sorry if I missed most of the discussion
[1:45:23] <%RioGascar> now i do think you should absolutely be able to overheat as it is a reallt good punishment and makes you wanna get better and time it so you end slow mo RIGHT before you run out
[1:45:46] <artoflec> yeah. There are literally just 2 too many ways to insta overheat in this game
[1:46:02] <%RioGascar> And no way to cool down except wait
[1:46:12] <+liquidzr0> tokenb3Schleep
[1:46:14] <xXxPS9xXx> @nekodelic No reward for using the cool stuff. Whether you're efficient or wasteful, the punishment is the same (overheat)
[1:46:15] <%RioGascar> so it doesn’t encourage anything but stop and pop
[1:46:16] <Solidnick18> Just take a seat
[1:46:17] <Talionshadow1138> Overheat is really harsh in general in this game
[1:46:20] <Solidnick18> stay awhile
[1:46:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> The only thing I want to change is melee meter usage should be dependent on how strong the attack is, instead of using the whole bar for every attack no matter how strong or weak
[1:46:27] <xXxPS9xXx> also waiting with the cooldown breaks the flow of the fight
[1:46:30] <pshuuu> and you lose your i-frames on your dodge too when overheated i think. when that big bullet comes flying at you while you're overheated, you're already dead
[1:46:31] <Solidnick18> OH
[1:46:35] <Solidnick18> I saw it
[1:46:40] <artoflec> well, it encourages me to not burn my meter all the way when boosting and AR ariming
[1:46:42] <+hoenhime344> basically some people say it promotes "lame" gunplay and some people say it does not. I say it does not. if you sit in 1 spot you are gonna get bumrushed by 3 different types of enemies, and 2 other types are gonna throw explosives while the boss huck drills at you
[1:46:55] <pshuuu> nice music
[1:47:05] <artoflec> and also if you sit in cover you're just playing other cover shooters which are lobosSleep
[1:47:18] <stranger59> 5 meters... that's in this room!
[1:47:22] <DjMizukari> I kinda missed this game
[1:47:31] <%RioGascar> like add in some way to cool the meter and it would be a MASSIVE improvement
[1:47:31] <%tearfuldevil> i played it a year ago, and i do not remember it doing anything to incentivize me to go in ever
[1:47:38] <Talionshadow1138> like see there, one melee attack there barely rewards you against that guy
[1:47:41] <%tearfuldevil> it made me move aorund, sure
[1:47:41] <Solidnick18> OH
[1:47:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> That's more like a BIOWEAPON
[1:47:48] <+liquidzr0> shofuAids
[1:47:49] <Solidnick18> surprise bitch
[1:47:52] <%tearfuldevil> but i jsut moved to different cover
[1:47:58] <%RioGascar> That way players wanna be as stylish as possible so thet can use slow mo as often as possible
[1:48:00] <xXxPS9xXx> The game is already great, but it would multiply its greatness if it gave you SOME way of quickly reducing cooldown
[1:48:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> Mr.Xtreme
[1:48:31] <pshuuu> @hoenhime344 we aren't saying we're sitting in cover non stop. we're saying for most of the fight thats just the best way to do things until you have to dodge an attach, after which you just slide to the next cover or die
[1:48:46] <pshuuu> look how often he overheats and cant do anything
[1:48:53] <+nekodelic> @xXxPS9xXx I would argue that meter management is a decent enough way to balance the game, and not that uncommon for a platinum game, but yeah, there are times that it may feel like it empties out too quickly
[1:48:54] <artoflec> going in for melee there destroyed his shield and left viper open to get his HP destroyed
[1:48:59] <%RioGascar> Cause as it stands doing cool things in this is for coolness sake and score...which boy is worthless
[1:49:00] <Talionshadow1138> the automatic slowdown as well hurts the pace of combat too.
[1:49:14] <artoflec> yeah god forbid i wanna have fun in my video game lmao
[1:49:33] <%RioGascar> why do cool thing if its gonna be risky
[1:49:40] <artoflec> because im good at it, its not risky for me.
[1:49:41] <xXxPS9xXx> @nekodelic there has to be a way to have meter management that doesn break the flow of the fight. Bottom line; relative to all the cool shit you can do, sitting there and waiting just aint that fun
[1:49:51] <%RioGascar> but if cool thing lowers out heat meter then its worth it
[1:49:54] <+hoenhime344> becuase it looks cool
[1:50:02] <+hoenhime344> why else would you take a risk in a video gamne
[1:50:04] <+nekodelic> @RioGascar would you say the same about DMC?
[1:50:07] <Solidnick18> pistol chan comeback
[1:50:10] <%RioGascar> Okay...what about other players?
[1:50:17] <%RioGascar> Dmc has the style meter
[1:50:19] <%RioGascar> music
[1:50:21] <artoflec> if it burns out heat meter, then im still playing a shooter that lets me move and reload cancel and blast fools in a way that feels better.
[1:50:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'll be honest, I don't see anything wrong with this game design's other than the levels are kinda samey
[1:50:22] <pshuuu> theres no risk to doing cool shit in dmc
[1:50:27] <%RioGascar> a ranking
[1:50:29] <%netrac> This game has score
[1:50:41] <pshuuu> here you just die instantly
[1:50:43] <%tearfuldevil> iirc its not actually a reload cancel?
[1:50:46] <+nekodelic> yeah, how is the style meter different from the scoring system?
[1:50:46] <%RioGascar> and even then its a confusing as fuck score
[1:50:47] <pshuuu> if you run out of heat without cover? you're dead
[1:50:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> I don't expect the game to fit into my play style, my playstyle is adjusted to fit with the game and that's how I have fun
[1:51:00] <artoflec> no you dodge because you have i frames lmao
[1:51:03] <%tearfuldevil> doesn't it just auto reload when you switch weapons
[1:51:04] <Talionshadow1138> It's like the game wants you to be cool, but it can't help but push you down on your ass by playing cool
[1:51:06] <artoflec> or you go AGGRESSIVE and you kill them before they kill you
[1:51:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> just don't get hit 4Head
[1:51:07] <artoflec> just like DMC
[1:51:12] <+hoenhime344> @pshuuu ehhhhhh maybe if you play DMC on baby bitch mode difficulty.
[1:51:29] <%RioGascar> cause dmc has APOCALYPTICCCCCC and the music GOES IN and then you get SADISTICCCCC and the vocals kick in
[1:51:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:51:31] <primaryfire> style meter is more dynamic and swings more depending on your immediate performance
[1:51:38] <%netrac> That armor can block a normal ass gun
[1:51:43] <artoflec> its also very hard to learn how to jump cancel perfectly and land a real impact without getting your ass stomped a few times too, but its worth learning because its F U N.
[1:51:46] <pshuuu> @hoenhime344 nah i s-ranked all dmc5 modes. the only remotely risky stuff is royal guard
[1:51:46] <%gunsrlove> Wait, How is ONE GUY with a pistol a threat at all
[1:51:58] <%CoronetChris> FRAAAAANK
[1:52:02] <+hoenhime344> @pshuuu well i guess you a re a god then
[1:52:03] <Solidnick18> FUCK YOU BURNS
[1:52:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> F
[1:52:06] <Reizie_Etherealm> That's an impossible angle but that was cool in a dumb way
[1:52:06] <%RioGascar> cause sams cutscene helmet is off
[1:52:08] <Solidnick18> you piece of shit
[1:52:09] <Talionshadow1138> BURNS WHY
[1:52:13] <Reizie_Etherealm> WOW
[1:52:15] <pixel_river> D:
[1:52:21] <joylent_blue> WHAT
[1:52:21] <Talionshadow1138> WHY THE RUSSIANS
[1:52:23] <%Irridium> here comes the best line in the game
[1:52:25] <%netrac> THE WAR ECONOMY
[1:52:25] <xXxPS9xXx> The reggie ark
[1:52:26] <%Irridium> in all of games
[1:52:27] <joylent_blue> THE WAR ECONOMY
[1:52:30] <JetpackMcQuack> He should be in Arms
[1:52:31] <%tearfuldevil> literally is
[1:52:32] <%RioGascar> BUT YOU DID THAT THO
[1:52:33] <%CoronetChris> GIVE WAR A CHANCE
[1:52:33] <MayorRev> AHAHAHAHA
[1:52:34] <+nekodelic> so it's more of a cognitive incentive that is lacking in this one compared to DMC? fair enough @RioGascar
[1:52:34] <%Irridium> THE GOOD OF ALL AMERICANS
[1:52:34] <%jepupu> Hipsterpocalypse
[1:52:35] <Mrbaconator> using war as a business to END war as a business!
[1:52:35] <bigboy3d> We metal Gear now!
[1:52:38] <DjMizukari> Conspiracy? lol
[1:52:39] <MayorRev> HE SAID THE THINGF
[1:52:42] <%RioGascar> you let those soldiers go home in a box
[1:52:43] <Solidnick18> alright sundowner
[1:52:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> HES NOT GEARS OF WAR MAN...HES SUNDOWNER
[1:52:53] <+HawkGoggles2> Is he gonna go outside and push?
[1:52:53] <HappyCutePhoenix> MANUALLY?! NotLikeThis
[1:52:53] <pshuuu> the enemy was americans after all
[1:52:57] <+hoenhime344> omg....he IS sundowner
[1:52:59] <artoflec> like i dont really care about the score in this game but im still going to try and do stylish shit
[1:53:04] <stranger59> He can fly like R2D2!
[1:53:04] <Talionshadow1138> people will die and kill for what they BELIEVE
[1:53:09] <pixel_river> fighting humans :D
[1:53:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @black_pariah
[1:53:23] <Solidnick18> LET'S GO
[1:53:26] <Talionshadow1138> lol this is spoilers for me, I didn't get this far in the game
[1:53:27] <%netrac> Sam is platonic military man
[1:53:29] <artoflec> and frankly, DMC5 stylish rank is the only one thats well designed because the others rate on orbs and time and items used and that crap
[1:53:37] <+NotHereToStream> like the good days of....
[1:53:38] <dustingV> back when this game came out I was writing an English exam and the prompt was asking about media and the image of being a man and if it's a good. think
[1:53:45] <dustingV> good thing*
[1:53:48] <%RioGascar> Art sure you do, but im talking OTHER players. like in play testing what reason is there to be stylish combat deisgner?
[1:53:52] <black_pariah> reggie: but elena tho
[1:53:55] <pshuuu> why didnt they have jetpacks before? gotta use them on your own citizens only
[1:53:56] <joylent_blue> DMC5's style ranking has its own problems but it is a step up from other games
[1:54:16] <Talionshadow1138> At the same time though, DMC5's style ratings are a bit too easy to get. But I guess that's just me being good at action games.
[1:54:20] <Bustahhwulf> minh cant lame him out retroKEKW
[1:54:22] <dustingV> I talked about how everything and everyone is this is the most gruff voiced alpha
[1:54:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[1:54:29] <%tearfuldevil> i suck at action games
[1:54:31] <%DatAsuna> Red scare reggie
[1:54:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie: BUT HER NAME
[1:54:35] <%tearfuldevil> well, msot video games really
[1:54:36] <Talionshadow1138> just feels a lot easier to S rank on normal, and even some missions on DMD
[1:54:38] <%jiggy_snipe> "bad one"
[1:54:38] <%RioGascar> just add something to cool your heat with some style meter thing. thats all in saying cause that VASTLY changes how players will play
[1:54:44] <JetpackMcQuack> Military complex is how we get vanquish suits PogChamp
[1:54:46] <Solidnick18> What a spy
[1:54:46] <%netrac> Being stylish is intrinsically rewarding tho
[1:54:52] <xXxPS9xXx> still can't let go reggie! lol
[1:54:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> Not even yourself's self
[1:54:56] <+hoenhime344> @RioGascar thats is the point of playing a game. to have fun. QA testers are the first line of feedback if a system is fun or not
[1:55:01] <%RioGascar> What about extrinsically
[1:55:06] <%tearfuldevil> fun = / = difficulty
[1:55:06] <joylent_blue> LUL
[1:55:10] <%ChoculaUltra> it sounds like the voice cast smoked an entire pack each
[1:55:18] <Talionshadow1138> that grenade didn't even blow up
[1:55:21] <artoflec> imean this game DOES have a score, its just not a big fat letter grade
[1:55:25] <xXxPS9xXx> @ChoculaUltra of cigars
[1:55:29] <%RioGascar> did gravity just freeze sam?
[1:55:37] <pshuuu> @hoenhime344 u think testers are good enough to give good feedback for platinum games? i doubt it
[1:55:42] <Tucker0603> dude is a fucking zaku
[1:55:43] <artoflec> honestly the factor i look at is cover used, i try to use it as little as i can
[1:55:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> Holy shit I never noticed that lmao
[1:55:46] <stranger59> Minecar race!
[1:55:52] <Talionshadow1138> when's Platinum gonna make a Gundam game dammit
[1:55:53] <Daxalog> Wheres his Heat Axe then?
[1:55:55] <Solidnick18> get back here!!!
[1:55:58] <%netrac> I'm not mentioning score because I'm not going to pretend to know how this game scoring system works
[1:56:00] <+hoenhime344> @pshuuu every game dev has tester man....
[1:56:05] <%RioGascar> Oh god this level
[1:56:07] <+zanzibar_junker> Burns is GP02
[1:56:08] <Talionshadow1138> I'm slightly hoping Konami lets them do Zone of the Enders
[1:56:13] <Talionshadow1138> just slightly
[1:56:20] <pshuuu> @hoenhime344 and most of them are average players. platinum games arent average
[1:56:25] <Reizie_Etherealm> If Burns is a Zaku then what is Sam? Unicorn Gundam?
[1:56:26] <+nekodelic> @hoenhime344 QA's main job is to make sure the devs deliver a functional prroduct first and foremost, how fun it is to play comes second
[1:56:45] <%RioGascar> hey player that can slow down time and do super cool jumps...let us remove that ability for this level
[1:56:46] <dj_arashi_rora> WOOLIE!
[1:56:49] <+Negus_Rex> Burns is Gundam GP02A
[1:56:50] <dj_arashi_rora> NO!
[1:56:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> ZoE is dead man. I dont remember hearing much buzz about that zoe2 rerelease
[1:56:52] <+hoenhime344> but they are still the FIRST feedback on if a system is enjoyable
[1:56:52] <%RioGascar> i said play testers, not QA
[1:56:57] <Solidnick18> ok race traitor
[1:56:59] <Mrbaconator> woolie the RACE TRAITOR
[1:57:01] <pshuuu> this part is way longer than i remember lmao
[1:57:01] <%jiggy_snipe> big traitor Woolie
[1:57:06] <+Aheg0d> Sell out humanity for sick alien tech LUL
[1:57:06] <Talionshadow1138> yeah godforbid QA and testers give some design feedback
[1:57:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[1:57:15] <stranger59> The juiciest asses
[1:57:19] <+NekoNinja13> I would trade the human race for a snek gf
[1:57:20] <+hoenhime344> @pshuuu that is extremely naive. not to mention insulting to QA lol
[1:57:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh there he goes again about his jetpack
[1:57:25] <kerotuyu> What if you didn't get it, but it was invented?
[1:57:26] <joylent_blue> Woolie is a relatable person
[1:57:28] <Talionshadow1138> @Bear_Mane sounds like Illusive Man from Mass Effect LUL
[1:57:28] <Jathspuh> Sell them out and then HUNT them too?
[1:57:37] <+hoenhime344> @pshuuu but i digress
[1:57:38] <%netrac> I doublt QA would have much feedback when it's burned playing the same buggy section 100s of times
[1:57:45] <stranger59> Space Russia will burn.
[1:58:00] <%RioGascar> theres also play testers, not just QA
[1:58:06] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Warconomy, if you will
[1:58:16] <%RioGascar> Which are primarily “is game fun?”
[1:58:17] <primaryfire> you're gonna use war as a business to get elected so that you can end war as a business???
[1:58:23] <%jiggy_snipe> wth was with the trajectory of that grenade?
[1:58:25] <pshuuu> big bad running from the player is always funny
[1:58:42] <DjMizukari> @Talionshadow1138 You think Gundam can handle being designed by Platinum? The combat aspect. They make pretty high paced games
[1:58:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[1:58:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie will drop colonies if it unlocks the vector cannon for his mech
[1:59:08] <%jiggy_snipe> Platinum did a good job with Transformers
[1:59:09] <DjMizukari> It might be cool though
[1:59:11] <Talionshadow1138> @DjMizukari ok maybe not Gundam, but Zone of the Enders for how high paced that is
[1:59:13] <%RioGascar> The needs of the many outweigh the needs of me who wants a jetpack
[1:59:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> if the aliens give me the alien goth gf of my dreams I'd turncoat quicker than woolie. that's all I have to say about the subject
[1:59:39] <+hoenhime344> have any of you played warfor cybertron? you can deff make a fast paced gundam game lol
[1:59:56] <pshuuu> does ac4a count as gundam?
[2:00:03] <Solidnick18> YO
[2:00:07] <Tucker0603> if the aliens give me a Amazonian Muscular wife....then I might...
[2:00:10] <Solidnick18> they don't mess around
[2:00:11] <artoflec> this is my least favourite section of this game, a lot of the rules don't apply.
[2:00:23] <Talionshadow1138> but like... War For Cybertron everything is of equal scale to you already. Hell, Platinum made Transformers Devastation too
[2:00:24] <pshuuu> LMAO
[2:00:25] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:00:26] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:00:30] <Solidnick18> what the hell
[2:00:33] <%RioGascar> I hated this section
[2:00:34] <+hoenhime344> what happened there?
[2:00:35] <pshuuu> didnt even slowdown
[2:00:35] <+hoenhime344> lol
[2:00:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> headshot....
[2:00:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> Man the man is killing us man!
[2:00:41] <DjMizukari> @Talionshadow1138 I see
[2:00:49] <%RioGascar> slow mo is not even useful here
[2:00:55] <%RioGascar> Just stay in cover
[2:01:16] <$TIME_PUNCHER> The headshot is the powerhouse of the damage
[2:01:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[2:01:27] <Solidnick18> don't get flustered
[2:01:27] <%RioGascar> see what i mean by game does activately encourage laming it out
[2:01:29] <DjMizukari> It would be lovely if Platinum Games developed an ONIMUSHA game!!!
[2:01:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> the first attempt is always the strongest one
[2:01:42] <pshuuu> yea on god hard i doubt you can even do cool shit
[2:01:47] <pshuuu> i didnt even attempt it lol
[2:01:51] <artoflec> @RioGascar this is the only section where that happens because these guys do way more damage. Come on dude, he's been out in the open for most of this stream.
[2:02:04] <+hoenhime344> ^
[2:02:11] <DjMizukari> @FuqBoiSlim I noticed that too
[2:02:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> this section does seem to be more of an outlier tbh
[2:02:19] <%RioGascar> And? What excuse does that give this section?
[2:02:28] <+hoenhime344> if you look at the score screen, it shows the % of time he uses cover
[2:02:32] <artoflec> it doesn't, i literaelly just said its my least favourite part of htis game
[2:02:37] <+hoenhime344> and it less tahn 30%
[2:02:49] <artoflec> because it breaks the rules that the rest of the game has had
[2:02:58] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:03:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> That SMACK
[2:03:16] <$TIME_PUNCHER> D'vorah is just a mutated Spider Gwen. Peace out.
[2:03:31] <+hoenhime344> @RioGascar you argument is not for this specific section. your argument is for the game as a whole
[2:03:40] <%RioGascar> Okay i think i need to be clear. I do not mean minh playing or any of the channels stylish dmc players or anyone here. i mean players in general
[2:04:06] <+hoenhime344> in that case you VASTLY underestimate the average video game boy or girl
[2:04:33] <RunningNGunning> No his name is Bobby B.
[2:04:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[2:04:45] <+hoenhime344> OMG BWahhahahahahahah

[2:04:53] <$TIME_PUNCHER> DAMN
[2:04:55] <%RioGascar> the game does a bad job at incentivizing its core mechanics to PLAYERS not minh, not art, just regular players
[2:05:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> DAMN
[2:05:09] <Solidnick18> rip
[2:05:10] <stranger59> murdered

[2:09:13] <pshuuu> i dont remember
[2:09:22] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Anime idea: Anthropromorphised guns
[2:09:24] <Ner234> What Act/Mission is this?
[2:09:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> Minh sounds like a divorcee right now. missing his ex-wife Armor-piercing Pistol
[2:09:27] <+hoenhime344> na woolie wanted to see what the boss could do
[2:09:36] <+hoenhime344> and Pat was just no go in, just do it. Just do it
[2:09:36] <+Akizea> @time_puncher girls frontline
[2:09:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> You made it nice
[2:09:40] <%RioGascar> Idea: when slow mo’d you can destroy the bullets
[2:09:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> @time_puncher Girls: Frontline. but that's a gacha
[2:09:49] <xXxPS9xXx> @TIME_PUNCHER make them girls and thats pure money
[2:10:05] <%RioGascar> No wait better idea: when in slow mo you can punch the bullets
[2:10:07] <WackyModder84> PlatinumGames seriously needs to make more games like this. Vanquish is a GEM

[2:10:42] <+hoenhime344> @RioGascar or imagine i fyou could command grab rockets!??!
[2:10:48] <artoflec> yeah that was great
[2:11:11] <pshuuu> yea like doing a justframe dodge
[2:11:19] <%RioGascar> like this is a GOOD blueprint that a sequel could absolutely bring to full potential with iterating
[2:11:19] <pshuuu> and you throw shit back. like what re3 is doing lol
[2:11:42] <Reizie_Etherealm> If he's fast then that just means you have to be FASTER Minh

[2:30:33] <%RioGascar> And also a probably BILLIONS OF DOLLAR SPACE STATION
[2:30:40] <stranger59> Yeah, the only loose end is the FREAKING RUSSIANS!
[2:30:41] <+sintydinty> Mikami do be on that fuckshit

[2:30:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yeah but San Fran is a like a 3rd of her voterbase. shes never getting reelected now
[2:30:57] <gekizenbu> we got 2 rereleases so we got that at least
[2:31:07] <pixel_river> i remember clearly the press complained about no multiplayer
[2:31:07] <%RioGascar> maybe it might happen now
[2:31:15] <OkamiDude15> platinum games : i am once again asking for your support on kickstarter for vanquish 2
[2:31:21] <%RioGascar> and heres what i would do
[2:31:25] <$TIME_PUNCHER> I guess the only fair thing to do is nuke Moscow now
[2:31:28] <%RioGascar> Trash the first games entire story
[2:31:28] <pshuuu> how would mp even work? everyone just boosting, nobody can aim with pad
[2:31:30] <+Balkespower> I want MGR 2
[2:31:35] <+Balkespower> tbh
[2:31:35] <+hoenhime344> we need a vanquished 2 and MORE IMPORTANTLY a Wonderful 102
[2:31:35] <%RioGascar> literally reboot
[2:31:39] <dj_arashi_rora> if we buy enough rereleases we'll get more!
[2:31:42] <%RioGascar> keep sam
[2:31:46] <%RioGascar> Keep the suit
[2:31:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> The real question is why is there a space colony attached to a giant microwave laser cannon, or why is there a cannon attached to the space colony
[2:31:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> "a bit"
[2:31:52] <%RioGascar> everything else throw away

[2:33:11] <artoflec> that Platinum Man character looks enough like Sam Gideon but i think Platinum Man might be the project GG thing
[2:33:19] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Vanquish (the Russians)
[2:33:23] <%RioGascar> I would be more than fine with vanquishs whole gameplay being lifted and taking sam and making a new game

[2:36:21] <artoflec> Thanks Shinji 🙏
[2:36:26] <Solidnick18> fun game
[2:36:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> based shinji
[2:36:45] <OkamiDude15> if you beat the first bogey and then got a transition into a much larger arena for you to use the limiter release boost and end on an escape sequence with the new boost would've been rad
[2:36:48] <pshuuu> not enough grind, 2/10
[2:37:09] <%RioGascar> This game is a diamond in the rough
[2:37:16] <%RioGascar> and a sequel would let it SHINE
[2:37:19] <Jathspuh> atpUgly
[2:37:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> A B-grade story attached to an A-grade game
[2:37:27] <zocano> Ya the context is weird cause you get the limiter release *after* you turn the fight back to 1v1
[2:37:31] <%RioGascar> oh no
[2:37:33] <%RioGascar> Its like
[2:37:37] <%RioGascar> an F story
[2:37:54] <zocano> Ya that story is a hard F
[2:37:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> lol I suppose
[2:38:01] <+Balkespower> there is a story in vanquish?
[2:38:33] <OkamiDude15> vanquish is a level based third person shooter with some cool mechanics :)
[2:38:42] <%RioGascar> inconsistencies out the ass, random character motivations change, things make no sense, why hasnt sam just shot...fuck whats his name? Gruff man?
[2:38:52] <zocano> If it was just the pre double bogey type of cutscenes the whole time it would at least get away with being cool
[2:38:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> you think platinum is ever just gonna say fuck it and just make the story near nonexistent one game
[2:38:53] <OkamiDude15> no story Kappa
[2:38:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> Burns
[2:39:00] <Tuna_Can_0> theres always DMD :)
[2:39:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> I still think the game gets away with having a bad story by being cool
[2:39:35] <pixel_river> for me action games dont have to have a good story
[2:39:40] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL aww mihn
[2:39:43] <joylent_blue> we think you're cool Minh GivePLZ
[2:39:53] <zocano> Ya but DMC is elevated by having a fun story to follow
[2:39:56] <artoflec> i find games trying to have a good story to have bad stories anyway so im fine with whatever.
[2:39:58] <OkamiDude15> what if platinum's ultraman game just plays like godhand evo19MindBlown but better
[2:39:58] <zocano> A dumb story
[2:40:01] <zocano> But a fun story
[2:40:04] <%RioGascar> oh yeah i dont reallycare about the story. And it doesnt matter if it was good or bad story
[2:40:17] <stranger59> 506 friendlies KIA
[2:40:22] <%RioGascar> its not the focus
[2:40:26] <%Javaa01> The problem with the amount of juice you get out of the bar by default is that on controller, you need to spend WAY more time on the aiming rather then the shooting on account that controllers aren't good for that
[2:40:37] <joylent_blue> 500 dead friends pvpWhy
[2:40:38] <%Javaa01> So on mouse, you get your value out of that bar
[2:40:39] <pshuuu> its definitely the best cover shooter
[2:40:45] <pshuuu> just because of the cover jump
[2:41:03] <%tearfuldevil> i haven't really played much cover shooters
[2:41:04] <%RioGascar> also i want to be able to do max payne style jump dives
[2:41:07] <Psyramics> its the best cover shooter because it gives you options when you aren't in cover that aren't 'die faster'
[2:41:07] <pixel_river> i knew it was different at the time because Bayonetta
[2:41:10] <Solidnick18> GOD HARD
[2:41:11] <%tearfuldevil> so i can't really judge the came much
[2:41:18] <Solidnick18> that's a good name
[2:41:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> G O D H A R D
[2:41:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> The tech makes it so much fun that I can overlook all the other flaws of the game
[2:41:26] <OkamiDude15> do you get anything from beating god hard?
[2:41:38] <%jiggy_snipe> trophy hunters aren't normal players though
[2:41:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[2:41:39] <pixel_river> Challenge mode unlocked?
[2:42:19] <%RioGascar> See fun note
[2:42:31] <%RioGascar> i beat vanquish and didn’t reinstall it till. Couple days ago
[2:42:47] <%RioGascar> and i suddenly unlocked that achievement on steam for 40 meter run
[2:42:51] <%jiggy_snipe> do it on stream
[2:42:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> Hand of God you say?
[2:43:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> MY ARM MY ARM MY ARM
[2:43:04] <stranger59> GODHARD is purely optional, they don't force you to do it for trophies.
[2:43:09] <OkamiDude15> when is minh gonna play god hand live on stream
[2:43:13] <Solidnick18> THE POWER OF THE GOD HARD
[2:43:28] <zocano> It’s cause god hard isn’t a fun difficulty
[2:43:32] <StarlitStunner> C Viper
[2:43:46] <pshuuu> god hand doesnt work right because of emulation. theres too much input delay
[2:43:48] <Thunderbird1005> Vanquish is such an underrated game, I loved playing this game
[2:43:51] <+Balkespower> you probably die instantly on God Hard
[2:43:54] <artoflec> yeah i dont like shooters on super high difficulty, its just die faster. I hope they do change up enemy composition though
[2:44:15] <zocano> Well it’s that plus the cut in half boost time
[2:44:16] <black_pariah> i told you you about that elevator one you werent looking at chat
[2:44:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> 2.2% of players got that. damn
[2:44:24] <%RioGascar> so the achievements do encourage you to learn mechanics
[2:44:26] <morow1ec> Challange 6 can go fuck itself
[2:44:33] <%RioGascar> half life 2 ravenholm achievement
[2:44:33] <+tuchpi> BRAVO
[2:44:33] <%jiggy_snipe> trophies are like challenges in fighting games
[2:44:34] <zocano> It makes vanquish more of a regular ass cover shooter
[2:44:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> I like when higher difficulty doesn't just mean tweaking the damage output
[2:44:38] <%RioGascar> use gravity gun only
[2:44:40] <OkamiDude15> does god hard increase enemy damage or disable the near death ars trigger or both?
[2:44:46] <+hoenhime344> BOOM thank you minh
[2:44:57] <Solidnick18> Cover action
[2:45:13] <Solidnick18> YE

[2:46:41] <Jathspuh> LuvBlondeL tpYGOcreepy LuvBrownR
[2:46:45] <%RioGascar> huh so challenges would definitely let players know more advanced mechanics
[2:47:03] <%RioGascar> Like mix achievements with challenges to let players know the tech
[2:47:09] <pshuuu> but nobody would attempt them before beating the game
[2:47:12] <pshuuu> so by then its too late
[2:47:22] <artoflec> too bad for them elaSmile
[2:47:36] <%RioGascar> like i got an achievement name “hot drop - while super dashing drop a grenade right under sam”

[2:52:02] <black_pariah> even in the challenge hes min maxing!!!!
[2:52:05] <%RioGascar> i think you’ll run out of platinum games eventually woolie
[2:52:05] <pshuuu> didnt even upgrade anything

[2:52:33] <+CarlosEoM> that's hype
[2:52:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> When he gets through all the action games he do the Infinite Space let's play
[2:52:40] <%DatAsuna> I love trilogies where it's totally not but then they bullshit it and claim it was a trilogy on the third one
[2:52:41] <%RioGascar> i think platinum MIGHT be stretching themselves
[2:52:45] <artoflec> and whatever the new osaka studio is working on too
[2:53:06] <pshuuu> they just opened a new studio in tokyo they announced today
[2:53:18] <pshuuu> so maybe they're fine
[2:53:22] <black_pariah> HE'S STILL MIHN MAXING
[2:53:35] <artoflec> oh yeah in tokyo, i read osaka somewhere, maybe regular platinum is there? artofl1Hm
[2:53:37] <%Javaa01> Those weapon pickups aren't for upgrading
[2:53:41] <%RioGascar> yeah but i seems like they might be doing too much stuff
[2:53:48] <%RioGascar> yeah they are doing well NOW
[2:53:51] <%RioGascar> But what about later
[2:53:52] <pshuuu> yea plat hq is osaka
[2:54:05] <+Proxzo> MINH MAXXED
[2:54:10] <JetpackMcQuack> number go up lysHype
[2:54:20] <%RioGascar> More studios = more money spent so who knows how its gonna work out
[2:54:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think this is them pulling back tbh. I think one of the reasons Scalebound fell through was platinum being stretched too thin
[2:55:03] <%RioGascar> and platinums curse of low sales is still around kinda
[2:55:06] <pixel_river> the project is named a go go from VJ literally
[2:55:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> at that time they had bayo 2 all those Activision games and nier automata
[2:55:40] <%Irridium> I mean Neir and Astral Chain, their two latest, sold REAL well
[2:55:54] <%RioGascar> true, i also could be wrong and platinums doing fine. I dont know their internal sales and how the companies internally running
[2:56:03] <artoflec> they always report that their games do well so who knows, i just want them to keep goin
[2:56:18] <%RioGascar> just having multiple projects worries me of a company stretching themselves too far
[2:56:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:56:26] <artoflec> yeah i get worried about them too :Weary:
[2:56:29] <artoflec> 😩
[2:56:49] <%RioGascar> cause platinums like...what 100 people?
[2:56:55] <artoflec> but they're such industry veterans helming that company that have been through all the capcom/clover shit, i feel like they're very experienced.
[2:56:57] <%generalve> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:56:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> I agree, I think they should focus on what they do best for like one or two more games that will sell well before branching out to establish a better foothold first

[2:58:36] <%RioGascar> But not legally saying it
[2:58:47] <TigerClaws12> did they talk about the platinum announcement at the start?
