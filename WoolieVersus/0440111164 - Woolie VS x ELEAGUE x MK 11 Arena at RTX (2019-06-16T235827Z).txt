[0:32:49] <thepiefoot> Waddup chat
[0:32:50] <BusterRepukken> lets see some noob saibot
[0:33:00] <+JustToWatch> So Dragon beat SonicFox at their most recent tourney
[0:33:06] <koolaid_kevster> @thepiefoot whuddup
[0:33:07] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> lookin good joker
[0:33:07] <nynightmare031> your skipping the whole 3rd round going to 4th lol
[0:33:09] <thepiefoot> So, Woolie manages illegal tournaments ?
[0:33:22] <jubejube56> @thepiefoot this is basically pit fighting
[0:33:36] <BusterRepukken> Noob Saibot pulls in some work on those towers.
[0:33:46] <mrs_dawg> go UnderDawg313 😊
[0:34:03] <nynightmare031> do #54 lol
[0:34:07] <+Lizard0TM> LUL
[0:34:12] <Lordredden> Noob saibot da real mvp
[0:34:16] <+razielhex> Been working through the Sub-Zero towers to unlock bits & pieces.
[0:34:24] <Captain_Aham> bout to see some kung lao, underdawg just wiped me 2-0
[0:34:26] <wanocountry> !Uptime
[0:34:26] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 35 minutes and 27 seconds
[0:34:35] <+razielhex> It's interesting no one calls him "Noob Saibot"; everyone calls him Bi-Han.
[0:34:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:34:41] <+FloorBurger> Yo is that Dragon?
[0:34:41] <thewhiterice92> Super Dragon!
[0:34:54] <BestTeaMaker> yeah it's Dragon, this is gonna be a wash
[0:35:18] <BestTeaMaker> ppl gonna learn about cetrion on this stream
[0:35:26] <+razielhex> Makes me consider that "Noob Saibot" is an extradiegetic nomenclature. To everyone else, he's Bi-Han Liang
[0:35:47] <thepiefoot> Is Kotal still ass?
[0:35:51] <BusterRepukken> I love Saibots character development from UMK3.
[0:36:00] <sspence57> dragon psn is the name that shows on the bracket
[0:36:12] <BusterRepukken> From just the black ninja, all the way to the personification of death in MK11
[0:36:21] <DasFreekman> Bi-Han is that kid who decided to give himself a nickname, and no one uses it
[0:36:25] <Lordredden> Dragon bout to destroy this man
[0:36:32] <+JakeSG> so you plink it?
[0:36:47] <Lordredden> @cerberusdriver Right??
[0:36:49] <%Wool> I'm somehow 2-0 in bracket ahhhhh
[0:36:50] <+razielhex> Well, Tundra.
[0:36:53] <+DrPoxx> Bi-Han is always Noob to me though.
[0:36:54] <thepiefoot> EL dragon
[0:37:00] <+JustToWatch> yeah that's dragon
[0:37:03] <Dragon_Batman> Looking good Woolz, Reggie
[0:37:15] <BusterRepukken> also Noobs voice is over the top edgy and I love it. I will not apologize.
[0:37:15] <Trepound> @Wool whats your psn
[0:37:17] <BestTeaMaker> time for some dirty cetrion zoning
[0:37:21] <+razielhex> Skarlet & Kotal reveal that the cryomancers are originally outworlders, so both Bi-Han and Kuai are descended from Outworld.
[0:37:28] <%Wool> @Trepound GeneralWool
[0:37:31] <Captain_Aham> It's gonna be cetrion vs kung lao
[0:37:34] <AceOne5> I just played UnderDawg, hes rough lol
[0:37:39] <%Wool> the fact that you're verified means you're an actual MK11 player and I'm screwed :(
[0:37:44] <+razielhex> So to Kotal, this means the Lin Kuei should be subjected.
[0:37:45] <thepiefoot> Didn't FonicSox said that Kotal is the worst char in the game ?
[0:37:48] <Captain_Aham> yeah man, lost round 1
[0:37:50] <@Menitta> you got this wool
[0:37:58] <+FloorBurger> Is this single elim?
[0:38:04] <ManOfReason> yeyeyeyyey live mic is super hot
[0:38:07] <+PrinceJehal> Yes, single elim
[0:38:08] <Lordredden> Funny how everyone calls cetrion the annoying zoner in this game when you have Sonya and Liu kang ...
[0:38:09] <AceOne5> yes @floorburger
[0:38:17] <@Menitta> quick play rap music
[0:38:18] <+razielhex> There's a Hard Kotal tower up *right now* at least on PC. He'll fuckin' juggle.
[0:38:25] <Trepound> no it just means im a twitch partner not a mk11 god lol
[0:38:25] <sspence57> @WoolieVersus check discord dragon said something there
[0:38:27] <%GabeSweetMan> GabeSweetMan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! The hypest menuing on Twitch!
[0:38:32] <nynightmare031> dragon and underdawg already played off steam
[0:38:33] <Captain_Aham> El Dragoon

[0:38:44] <+razielhex> @GabeSweetMan Everything is eventually an extension of the first 4-5 parts of KOTOR
[0:38:52] <BestTeaMaker> LOL
[0:38:58] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL @razielhex
[0:38:59] <the_underdawg> He sent me an invite. I didn’t know we were supposed to play on stream
[0:39:03] <thewhiterice92> Get your crying baby in front of the mic
[0:39:07] <Xandertrejo> So uh what's going on this stream?
[0:39:12] <coreybom> @woolieversus already played my set
[0:39:33] <thepiefoot> @Xandertrejo Woolie is the TO of an illegal tournament stream. Team Spooky is on blast
[0:39:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Which Discord channel is this tourney in?
[0:39:50] <koolaid_kevster> what bracket is this?
[0:39:52] <the_underdawg> Yeah. It was a rough one. I would have waited if I had known
[0:39:52] <nynightmare031> me and fgcdoom havent played yet and can play on stream
[0:39:57] <SakiSakuraTV> hi hi
[0:40:05] <Xandertrejo> @thepiefoot oh okay lol, thanks dude
[0:40:14] <HellaLarry> how many brackets are there
[0:40:21] <keji992> You should try the best game ever. Sonic Heroes
[0:40:22] <SakiSakuraTV> we have not done it yet
[0:40:24] <+shivvey> Can’t wait to see spooky take over to run the stream
[0:40:29] <the_underdawg> Sorry for the mic issue. I’m watching on mobile so I’m a bit behind
[0:40:29] <+brickwall35> when does Woolie ignore the tourney results and declares himself champion?
[0:40:31] <nynightmare031> @woolieversus me and fgcdoom havent played in this round yet and can play on stream
[0:40:42] <+razielhex> @keji992 Liam & Matt started Sonic06 yesterday. It will be the death of them.
[0:40:43] <thepiefoot> @brickwall35 First he must pick the boss character
[0:40:44] <AceOne5> YOU DIDNT WIN
[0:40:50] <SakiSakuraTV> can't wait mew ^_^
[0:40:55] <+drewdrew89> woolie dont start
[0:40:59] <Dragon_Batman> Bob barker was a good host
[0:41:14] <DasFreekman> So when is the Sonic: The Fighters bracket?
[0:41:15] <+razielhex> I liked how Bob Barker punched out Adam Sandler.
[0:41:17] <keji992> Sonic 2006 i bought in high school on xbox 360 back then. I enjoyed it. Its not perfect but people give it too much flack than it deserves
[0:41:23] <SakiSakuraTV> yep!
[0:41:23] <keji992> i liked it
[0:41:36] <keji992> i kind of am not fan of boost to win mechanic though in sonic games
[0:41:36] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:41:39] <+JustToWatch> Ed Boon gave Woolie a special code so that he could play Goku in MK11
[0:41:48] <SakiSakuraTV> feel free to shorten it to saki while you commentate tho ^_^ thats what everyone calls me lol

[0:42:31] <BestTeaMaker> oh man, dragon and tweedy are on the same side of the bracket

[0:42:43] <HefestoForges> !uptime
[0:42:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 43 minutes and 44 seconds
[0:42:47] <keji992> @Fujiwara_92 literally light orange. Just to joke. Imagine a protest about that X).. My skin never transparent a piece of paper.. Raaaaaaage. :P
[0:42:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Where can I find the bracket? Which discord channel am i looking for?
[0:42:54] <Xandertrejo> @razielhex lol that's true
[0:43:03] <%Wool> @Trepound ggs

[0:43:21] <Trepound> ggs @Wool
[0:43:25] <thepiefoot> Is Jade a lame character? I barely see her
[0:43:25] <HefestoForges> damn it's throwboi
[0:43:25] <algi80> that's a big fist
[0:43:25] <Xandertrejo> also Woolie made me think of the Photoshop of the White Woolie from a while back
[0:43:26] <+razielhex> Fukken Geras? 2-Button KRUSHING BLOW all day
[0:43:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Is he using a Potato Masher??
[0:43:35] <keji992> Where is Stryker :(
[0:43:39] <%Wool> welp, the Wool/Woolie dream is dead :(
[0:43:40] <+brickwall35> brass knuckles
[0:43:41] <algi80> foam hand
[0:43:41] <keji992> he was my favorite in Mortal Kombat 3
[0:43:46] <koolaid_kevster> brass knuckles
[0:43:46] <+PhantomGoo> Fist-O glove
[0:43:46] <+razielhex> @keji992 Nether-realm
[0:43:55] <HefestoForges> OH LAWD HE COMIN
[0:43:59] <+FloorBurger> @WoolieVersus Have you switched to Geras yet?
[0:43:59] <@Menitta> @wool one day you'll fight Woolie on stream.
[0:44:11] <ManOfReason> "oh lawdy" im getting the vapors!"
[0:44:13] <thepiefoot> Ger ass's splash is too funny
[0:44:16] <+Checktrap> Wah Gwan !!!
[0:44:17] <+linkwolf4> Geras is just Rage with time powers
[0:44:18] <+razielhex> Jade is beloeved. She's got great zoning and rushdown.
[0:44:19] <%Wool> I'm so surprised I managed to win 2 sets
[0:44:29] <%mr_sups> Sexy costumes became male exclusive
[0:44:31] <Captain_Aham> Gearas is out hear playing injustice 2
[0:44:33] <%myrrdraal1515> Are we screamlording?
[0:44:47] <BestTeaMaker> yep
[0:44:48] <%mr_sups> We lording over those screams.
[0:44:52] <algi80> he has all the pocket sand he needs
[0:44:52] <thepiefoot> Da uppercut
[0:45:03] <BestTeaMaker> i hope we see tweedy vs dragon on stream
[0:45:06] <BestTeaMaker> that one is coming up soon
[0:45:09] <+linkwolf4> Geras IS the pocket sand
[0:45:13] <%GabeSweetMan> AmWhite.iso is in trouble! You need to run the latest patch!
[0:45:21] <koolaid_kevster> looked like a brass knuckles without a hand
[0:45:22] <HefestoForges> ouch
[0:45:27] <keji992> i loved the megaman art reviews of art boxes
[0:45:39] <+razielhex> her Fatal Blow being an overhead (Like Cassie's) tricks me almost everytime
[0:45:45] <DasFreekman> nice!
[0:45:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> FINISH HIM
[0:45:52] <Omni_Free> my internet went out :(

[0:46:54] <VincentValen> why no respect? can't be biased? :P
[0:47:04] <+razielhex> C's are not allowed to be used while Kombat streaming, exkept to refer to the Carlton's or Cetriot.

[0:47:55] <DasFreekman> @WoolieVersus that one is twice in a row to activate
[0:48:43] <+razielhex> the slowdown on the krushing uppercut can be tough to link up due to the minor gap in input ignoring

[0:49:07] <SakiSakuraTV> oo nice!
[0:49:07] <snakemuho> and that's why you don't spend it in round 1
[0:49:08] <algi80> so close
[0:49:11] <thepiefoot> Jade seems like she plays really basic
[0:49:23] <BusterRepukken> yeah not a big fan of Jade in this game
[0:49:24] <LeaIsChill> SAISHO WA GUU
[0:49:26] <+razielhex> Scorpion, both briggs have range-based Krushing Blows on moves
[0:49:36] <thepiefoot> @LeaIsChill JAN KEN
[0:49:53] <keji992> Anyone worried about SONY censorship when they moved from Tokyo HQ to California HQ? its for this reason that if they censor game developers that i am moving from PS4 to Nintendo or Xbox when PS5 comes out
[0:49:56] <LeaIsChill> @thepiefoot GOO Kreygasm
[0:50:01] <DasFreekman> which jax move has that krushing blow?
[0:50:10] <snakemuho> Kabal's FB is one of the best
[0:50:12] <+razielhex> I think it's his rushing punch
[0:50:14] <VincentValen> hey....kotal's can catch a lot of people off guard since its a 2 hit.
[0:50:29] <+razielhex> which when krushing looks move like an open-bhuddist's palm
[0:50:34] <gk1llah> rooCop
[0:50:37] <BusterRepukken> i wish they'd uncensor Johnny's taunt
[0:50:42] <thepiefoot> Ger ASS
[0:50:44] <+razielhex> Ouch
[0:50:51] <sspence57> will you be streaming all of top 8 woolie?
[0:51:11] <+razielhex> Jade's gone to the ZONE ZONE
[0:51:58] <keji992> that hit looked lethal
[0:52:07] <thepiefoot> Lariatto
[0:52:09] <DasFreekman> @razielhex ah i get you, it technically triggers when just the second hit connects, but most of the time its from a max range
[0:52:45] <fuji_92> PogChamp FINAL ROUND HYPE PogChamp
[0:52:50] <thepiefoot> I haven't seen a single D Vorah
[0:53:02] <snakemuho> she's below bad
[0:53:08] <+razielhex> @WoolieVersus From Goro's lair, the Kytinn Queen was cannibalized by her and her kind for the Queen's failure to defend against Shao Khan.
[0:53:13] <BusterRepukken> its ironic because D Vorah is OP in story mode.
[0:53:24] <SakiSakuraTV> gg friend!
[0:53:29] <+razielhex> @thepiefoot She's considered the worst. Even though in the story D'Vorah has the most lore kills than anyone except Sindel.
[0:53:31] <fuji_92> gg
[0:53:32] <+IsoAmWhite> gg for sure
[0:53:37] <SakiSakuraTV> @IsoAmWhite that was fun :D
[0:53:39] <flavasava7> anyone know where i can watch Reflect tournament ? it finished
[0:53:44] <+Shotgundam009> Head pats FeelsGoodMan
[0:53:46] <DasFreekman> good to see some jade ggs!
[0:53:55] <SakiSakuraTV> @DasFreekman <3
[0:53:57] <MSN04_Sazabi> Isn't Kotal worse than D'Vorah?
[0:53:59] <BusterRepukken> Im also not very excited for Sindel tbh. Just never really cared for her.
[0:53:59] <+IsoAmWhite> it was @sakisakuratv :D
[0:53:59] <thepiefoot> @razielhex Wasn't Honeybee gonna play her ?
[0:54:01] <+IsoAmWhite> no
[0:54:04] <SakiSakuraTV> back to more training :D
[0:54:07] <+IsoAmWhite> @woolieversus
[0:54:09] <+hillbillypowpow> Isoamwhite taking it with the big black
[0:54:10] <+razielhex> @thepiefoot Maybe as a gimmick.
[0:54:10] <khemist_mk> nope
[0:54:12] <keji992> the lethal strike should be "FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC"
[0:54:14] <SakiSakuraTV> @IsoAmWhite good luck!

[0:57:40] <LeaIsChill> Geras is missing a lot of the big Gerasisms like sand punishes and uppercuts. Once he catches momentum he crushes it though
[0:57:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Well then....
[0:57:51] <+razielhex> @Trepound Just play Shao Khan.
[0:57:52] <+linkwolf4> look at johnny in the background waiting for his turn that will never come...
[0:58:11] <snakemuho> you can get grabbed during a ducking startup too
[0:58:13] <+razielhex> @linkwolf4 Johnny will always be there, unless someone is Johnny. All he does is kiss his biceps.
[0:58:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Holy ****

[1:04:22] <Djinnazz> those engines are reffin.
[1:04:31] <+cafefunk> Is there like a vote or a publicity stunt we could pull to have Woolie and Reggie commentate at Evo?
[1:04:49] <+cafefunk> Maybe start like a hashtag or sending a bunch of emails to the company?
[1:04:49] <Mofo209> No

[1:07:32] <rufus2k2> Woolie did you see Ed Boon was talking about if people wanted a Thunder skin for Night Wolf in MK11? Think Fulgore might be in one of the Kombat Packs?
[1:07:45] <Kuroitatsu> !brackets
[1:07:50] <+razielhex> Fulgore Skin for Sektor? Hahaha
[1:07:51] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus make sure tweedy and dragon wait on their match though, we definitely want to see that
[1:08:04] <itsdfc> NRS wouldn't include a character that would be exclusive to a platform
[1:08:21] <+razielhex> Spawn was pretty exclusive to Playstation.
[1:08:24] <fuji_92> match point for tweety PogChamp
[1:08:28] <Tennochief> MK9 begs to differ but hopefully they learned from that
[1:08:29] <+Borkbiff > apatBig

[1:09:32] <Mitsuownes> So Tweedy got to enter two tournaments?
[1:09:32] <+razielhex> What makes Geras strong is that you can get 2-3 Krushing Blows per match

[1:18:00] <SunsetJack> I love the one where Liu Kang and Kung Lao bet who wears the hat or not lol.
[1:18:02] <Mofo209> That’s because they aren’t X-rays
[1:18:06] <Tennochief> a rose by any other name
[1:18:08] <VincentValen> now the fatal blows are more about the blood being spilled
[1:18:08] <Mofo209> It’s a Fb

[1:22:19] <Captain_Aham> my boy won the DMV cookout with kotal yesterday
[1:22:28] <fgcdoom> @ArtThouBored thing about chop chop is that I can extend it. its a guessing game
[1:22:30] <boombockz> they shoiuld give him the damage totem in a variation
[1:22:33] <punkthepsychopenguin> Not even atzecs liked atzecs

[1:53:18] <AncelDeLambert> it's working
[1:53:30] <+jepupu> Where's the Tiger Apricots though?

[1:54:51] <fuji_92> Shin Larry, so Sherry
[1:55:07] <+razielhex> Khan can get some 10-11 hit combos but it requires 2 bars.
[1:55:09] <gmoneyrob> @DasFreekman hell yeah Shao Kahn is the answer

[1:55:44] <ItsKittys> Lets go larry
[1:55:44] <+razielhex> @punkthepsychopenguin Shao Khan is a misogynist. He doesn't look at women with affection, but rather objects to own.
[1:55:51] <+xjaewon> LETS GO TRE!
[1:55:57] <punkthepsychopenguin> Okay well he wants to own Cassie last I remember.
[1:56:00] <ItsKittys> 😒
[1:56:01] <greekyogurt777> if EVO this year has Kotal Kahn as the champion I'll die happy.
[1:56:10] <AncelDeLambert> c'mon Larry, get a combo in
[1:56:13] <+jetjagger222> Shao Kahn treats objects like women man
[1:56:15] <Captain_Aham> Zonya
[1:56:20] <+razielhex> He's like that with Sonya, Jade, Cassie, and Jackie too.
[1:56:20] <VincentValen> pretty sure I'm like the only kotal player so....yeah not much chance there :p

[1:59:59] <+razielhex> gotta saturate it
[2:00:02] <%GabeSweetMan> @Aliziion Indeed!
[2:00:04] <greekyogurt777> Salt water

[2:00:37] <%Wool> does Woolie have a grandfather clock in his house?
[2:00:44] <WhyIDie> listen to HydrateBot, he surely isn't just making us plump for The Harvest MrDestructoid
[2:00:50] <c60_Jam> What is this?
[2:00:57] <+razielhex> it's just water weight. it cooks out.
[2:01:01] <greekyogurt777> Woolie is the grandfather clock
[2:01:11] <$MateoPeso> I would hate to be a streamer and have people constantly telling you to drink water like you haven't made it through life this far without dying
[2:01:23] <koolaid_kevster> ty <3
[2:01:34] <+Aliziion> @swish19xx Stay hydrated
[2:01:38] <peachy996> Some people are hardcore with their streaming tho
[2:01:43] <c60_Jam> Is Woolie challenging veryone who was on Eleague?
[2:01:44] <peachy996> I can understand the need for the bot
[2:01:45] <$MateoPeso> I will die on principle

[2:02:54] <banetimusprime> Woolie and French LTG

[2:03:34] <AncelDeLambert> Regain your honor, Larry!
[2:03:40] <+Aliziion> The fire interactable on the right corner thats like +40 is kinda ridiculous
[2:03:45] <peachy996> Krizalid had such a great theme
[2:03:45] <+Aliziion> Forgot the stage tho
[2:03:56] <peachy996> Shaolin Trap Temple?

[2:04:19] <Captain_Aham> fullscreen
[2:04:26] <c60_Jam> Woolie's hosting a tournament?
[2:04:28] <CrimsonBrave> yea that corner interactable is kinda od
[2:04:30] <+razielhex> you're lookin' at it. Cetrion is the best zoner, but Jade is descent, and so is Cassie.
[2:04:31] <fuji_92> I mean, there's Zonia so...
[2:04:31] <AncelDeLambert> RIP Larry
[2:04:36] <peachy996> I've heard stories but Shinnok's Bone Temple with the two grab interactables, the bone scythe and the projectile is a scary one
[2:04:59] <+Aliziion> Mk11 zoning is better than mkx but worse than Inj2

[2:05:35] <ManOfReason> are those police sirens?
[2:05:35] <thewhiterice92> POPO on the way
[2:05:36] <CrimsonBrave> yea the zoning is strong but most characters have a way to nullify it a bit

[2:05:36] <+razielhex> happy father's day, KILL YER DAH
[2:05:39] <greekyogurt777> Tbh Zoning in this game doesn't feel impossible to combat against, least for me it hasn't been as bad
[2:05:40] <AncelDeLambert> more parental abuse
[2:05:40] <DasFreekman> The answer always reminds me of JSRF. love that song
[2:05:41] <+IluZDave> Larry can’t match dragon on cetrion play Cassie or Sonya or jade
[2:05:41] <sspence57> do i hear sirens
[2:05:42] <$MateoPeso> That GIF of Jacqui doing the Fatal and getting hit by the bouncing bullets kills me
[2:05:45] <CrimsonBrave> in mk11

[2:10:15] <+Aliziion> Jax is so underrated
[2:10:20] <357Sneak> imaChamp PowerUpR PowerUpR zyzxWaa
[2:10:22] <+razielhex> @sspence57 All the Brutality freeze frames look kind of awkward. You can spend so much time unlocking all of these great extro and intro cinematics just to never see them due to Brutality/Fatalities not triggering them.
[2:10:37] <bak2skool> im about to jax off
[2:10:38] <fuji_92> Jax is just gunless Barret Kappa

[2:11:34] <drifter__xd> I wish I knew about this tourny
[2:11:40] <drifter__xd> i keep missing em
[2:11:55] <Cruel_Tentacles> In the corner it's even more crazy.
[2:12:15] <VincentValen> well there's two more qualifiers next week. its the whole country though, so many more participants.

[2:15:24] <DasFreekman> wp larry gg tweedy
[2:15:26] <%Wool> Is 3rd place the only double elim thing?
[2:15:39] <+IluZDave> So Larry got 4th?
[2:15:40] <+Aliziion> Jaqcui’s f31 1+3 damage is kinda ridiculous
[2:15:43] <%Terrinater_> I know this happens is just about every fighter but I really want them to buff some of the other characters. seeing the same 4 characters fight after fight is going to get old QUICK
[2:15:47] <fuji_92> grand finals PogChamp
[2:16:02] <+TheBensonator_> It's time for your MAIN EVENT. pbbrrbbrprbgbbgprbbpppghh
[2:16:05] <%Wool> @Trepound you better win after beating me. >:C
[2:16:15] <VincentValen> well the game's not even two months old yet. Plenty of time to change things
[2:16:15] <fuji_92> best outta 5 right? Kappa
[2:16:18] <Tennochief> LUL
[2:16:23] <+Aliziion> They just need to give the other characters more viable KB’s man
[2:16:27] <WhyIDie> if they opened up custom variations for tourneys I think you'd see a lot more variety, just from people being unfamiliar with matchups
[2:16:33] <ManOfReason> woolie is just a groupie Kappa
[2:16:33] <Tennochief> who will be the star pupil of the Wooli dojo?
[2:16:41] <+TheBensonator_> R E S P E C K
[2:16:44] <DasFreekman> OOOO lawd that my baby!!
[2:16:54] <$MateoPeso> Believe in the Woolie that believes in you
[2:16:59] <Captain_Aham> wollie gotta kata for their entrance
[2:17:09] <%Terrinater_> Actually... yeah, the customs would probably do it
[2:17:22] <gmoneyrob> let's gooo
[2:17:22] <fuji_92> Woolie will be your Kamina and die for you so you can pierce the heavens Keepo
[2:17:26] <peachy996> Who is Woolie hypelording anyway?
[2:17:36] <+Aliziion> Well they said there will be more variations in the future
[2:17:48] <$MateoPeso> Mortal Kombat is about family
[2:17:53] <WhyIDie> "and I said bittcccccchhhhhhh"
[2:18:06] <peachy996> hopefully kollector gets somethin different
[2:18:20] <+razielhex> some of the default variations are pretty awful. There's even a few that don't use all 3 slots. Scorpion's second variation is 2 one-bar abilities. There's like 6 others you could add.
[2:18:24] <+Justlaxy> now I wanna play a couple of maches
[2:18:27] <peachy996> not even buffs just throw a diff variant together
[2:18:30] <gmoneyrob> ouch
[2:19:04] <+Who_lio42> thats only with the non competitive defaults, I dont get why those are so bad
[2:19:36] <cycl6ne> lol dragon spamming wins
[2:19:38] <+SmortyPuffin> oh shit woolie's in eleague?
[2:19:42] <WhyIDie> she's hydrating
[2:19:54] <+razielhex> stay_hydrated_sonya.mkv
[2:19:54] <+Aliziion> Dragon spamming skill again damn
[2:19:57] <fuji_92> y'all get ready for scrubquotes chat again
[2:20:03] <CrimsonBrave> ^
[2:20:07] <gmoneyrob> yes Jade let's gooo
[2:20:09] <+SmortyPuffin> I thought he didn't even like this game
[2:20:14] <%Terrinater_> yeah I forgot how drastically the variations change their combo potential. Buff was the wrong word.
[2:20:19] <peachy996> this matchup is so boring but it's so smart
[2:20:21] <mr_ESB> For the title belt?
[2:20:22] <Cendov> NRS chatvis always scrubquotes chat LUL
[2:20:25] <+Aliziion> Uhhh lets go
[2:20:31] <+Aliziion> Lets see this
[2:20:48] <%Wool> so what does that purple aura do for Jade?
[2:20:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:20:56] <+razielhex> jade can zone while being immune to zone
[2:20:56] <peachy996> Projectile Immunity
[2:21:06] <cycl6ne> does her glow go away if she gets hit by projectile?
[2:21:13] <+razielhex> no, only if she's hit physically
[2:21:16] <peachy996> on timer
[2:21:17] <+Aliziion> no it has a timer
[2:21:22] <fuji_92> PogChamp
[2:21:28] <+razielhex> yeah, or you wait it out
[2:21:31] <Cruel_Tentacles> Dragon still spamming that neutral smh.
[2:21:32] <mr_ESB> Jeezus
[2:21:37] <+TheBensonator_> Got damn
[2:21:39] <+Aliziion> the quick rise always catches ppl off guard
[2:21:54] <%Hammerknife> huh mortal kombat isn't as gory as i remember
[2:22:01] <Tennochief> shame
[2:22:20] <+razielhex> the krushing blows, fatal blows, and finishers are where it gets graphic
[2:22:27] <gmoneyrob> not like this
[2:22:32] <peachy996> brutalities too
[2:22:39] <+razielhex> brutalities are finishers
[2:22:41] <Tennochief> wis hwe still could've gotten the battle damage from MK9 back
[2:22:43] <%king_wragles> So is this Woolie commentating?
[2:22:43] <BestTeaMaker> WOOLIE BOUT TO REP DRAGON
[2:22:52] <+bolisauriozona> this is too gory for some people, specially some fatalities like geras skin stuff
[2:22:53] <Cruel_Tentacles> The issue with Jade is that she crumbles under pressure.
[2:22:59] <WhyIDie> 0 respect
[2:22:59] <%king_wragles> Rather, Woolie AND Reji doing commentary?
[2:23:05] <Cruel_Tentacles> Even from Cetrion.
[2:23:05] <+razielhex> And if they continue like MK10, we'll see stage fatalities integrated later
[2:23:06] <+Aliziion> dvorahs fatal is cute

[2:32:29] <%shmupdogjoe> so, here's a question I don't think anyone's examined. Did Goji just dust like 50 km of Japanese wilderness with nuclear steam just to stop a smog monster?
[2:32:32] <fuji_92> who?
[2:32:40] <theguy4445> i just tuned in wtf is happening
[2:32:42] <fuji_92> THE WATER SUPPLY

[2:32:59] <Cendov> The tournamemt is over @theguy4445
[2:33:08] <+razielhex> "Just children and men" explicitly segues into JoJO, where there exists just children and men.
[2:33:11] <TungstenViper> BISOOOON
[2:33:14] <gunsrlove> BISONNNNNNNNNn
[2:33:16] <%shmupdogjoe> and *is* that a metaphor for the sad reality that nuclear power is still better than fossil fuels despite the still negative consequences?
