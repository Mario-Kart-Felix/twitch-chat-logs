[0:45:26] <+Deepfriedhamster> Sam is the Babayaga of Porters to Mules

[0:46:07] <+thesw1tch> you rolled up on them

[0:46:14] <+QueequegTheater> I don't
[0:46:23] <worldbrand> it'd be kinda fucked up but hey
[0:46:27] <+RealThiele> shoot criminals into space so the void out there

[0:47:42] <worldbrand> did he just big band a motherfucker
[0:47:53] <dukenux> also, i didn't know you get a harmonica in this game. that's awesome
[0:47:59] <vVAstrAVv> !uptime
[0:47:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 59 minutes and 18 seconds
[0:48:04] <+Deepfriedhamster> yeah its awesome
[0:48:08] <Mothman742> @dukenux ur awesome
[0:48:09] <+Deepfriedhamster> harmonica for lyfe
[0:48:09] <+kyh9> Tea Bags are a type of Strand too
[0:48:13] <%Irridium> and then they get your balls across their face
[0:48:18] <%The_Timo> Lol you are a chump, Sam however is not
[0:48:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> I imagine sam wearing his gold glasses and baseball cap, drinking a Monster while T-bagging a Mule
[0:48:21] <+Mkingston> Postman always knocks twice. Bang Bang
[0:48:30] <+Deepfriedhamster> the T in tea is for sTrands
[0:48:31] <worldbrand> if you saw sam carrying that many packages, just running over the hills at full sprint like the ocarina of time postman, you would stay out of sight
[0:48:37] <@Solidus_113> deliver deez nuts on your chin
[0:48:49] <+BionoidLCR> Dam solidus
[0:48:55] <+kyh9> "Sam. isn't it interesting how Tea Bags have strands"
[0:49:14] <Picosunloaded> Break your neck with deez nuts
[0:49:17] <+Deepfriedhamster> they say the ancient people drank tea together to share in a community setting
[0:49:26] <peachy996> You must keep delivering to find that answer
[0:49:36] <+RealJonDo> "the strings on tea bags are actually 53,000 year old umbilical cords"
[0:49:46] <+Deepfriedhamster> they tie us tot he tea
[0:49:48] <+RealThiele> real fact: the american founding fathers were almost out of tea, and so turned the entire boston harbor into a teapot
[0:50:00] <+Deepfriedhamster> TEA is FREEDOM
[0:50:03] <AceOne5> Lou enjoys flying at dangerous speeds lol
[0:50:07] <peachy996> Boston Harba
[0:50:11] <+Mkingston> Why is Woolie back here?
[0:50:16] <masterfire23> i love sams double jump its so goofy
[0:50:20] <+Deepfriedhamster> hes exploring
[0:50:26] <+RealJonDo> this game would be cooler if the ziplines were rails you grind with a skateboard
[0:50:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> You think any fish died of caffeine overdose in the Boston Harbor?
[0:50:40] <worldbrand> i did not know you could control that
[0:50:43] <+Deepfriedhamster> oh man
[0:50:48] <worldbrand> i have fallen down mountains
[0:50:49] <+Deepfriedhamster> green tea Fish
[0:50:59] <Soulbishop> What in the Sunset overdrive?
[0:51:00] <+Deepfriedhamster> in real life or in game?
[0:51:16] <worldbrand> in the game, everyone knows mountains arent real
[0:51:20] <+RealThiele> falling down a mountain irl is probably death
[0:51:24] <peachy996> Our Founding Fathers would be shocked if they tasted our tea now
[0:51:30] <+Mkingston> @ThaRealJonDo this game would be cooler if you were Spider-Man
[0:51:35] <+RealJonDo> very true
[0:51:45] <+RealThiele> just be sonic and grind the zipline for rings
[0:51:47] <+Deepfriedhamster> this game would be cooler in a fridge
[0:52:03] <%The_Timo> "How do they float that high?" Bitch they fucking float lol, as high as they want
[0:52:13] <worldbrand> this game would be cooler in unreal engine with basic assets in a generic grassy field
[0:52:26] <+Deepfriedhamster> maybe they're goin tovisit a specific prepper
[0:52:37] <+RealThiele> this game was definitely not what people were expecting
[0:52:39] <+Deepfriedhamster> the forest is best with a bridge
[0:52:53] <VidulaSaix> I think it's exactly what people were expecting
[0:52:54] <VidulaSaix> Delivery man
[0:52:59] <+RealThiele> i feel like this is what a survival game becomes with a $50 mil budget
[0:53:03] <+Deepfriedhamster> @RealThiele but did it deliver LUL
[0:53:09] <+RealThiele> LUL
[0:53:32] <+Deepfriedhamster> if he re uses the engine for ther stuff
[0:53:33] <worldbrand> i went through the hole
[0:53:35] <+Deepfriedhamster> then its awesome
[0:53:48] <+Deepfriedhamster> was the hole moist
[0:53:53] <+RealThiele> yea this engine has a lot of potential, and osny said it was a commercial success
[0:54:04] <worldbrand> it rains a lot over there so yes, the hole is often moist
[0:54:12] <worldbrand> i put a safehouse on that clfif over there. there's nothing up there btw
[0:54:23] <+RealThiele> dunno if woolie can see chat atm
[0:54:26] <+Deepfriedhamster> there is that spot

[0:55:07] <worldbrand> the veteran porter?
[0:55:18] <IndoorSitup> Is Spec Ops after this?
[0:55:26] <+RealThiele> big warcrime time
[0:55:30] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.
[0:55:31] <Mothman742> tomorrow
[0:55:40] <IndoorSitup> ah i see
[0:55:41] <+Deepfriedhamster> no, theres a mountain nearby. if you climb it theres a memory card and something else
[0:55:51] <+Deepfriedhamster> but it feels like theres more too it
[0:56:02] <+RealThiele> omnideliver
[0:56:12] <Djinnazz> If they're already at lvl 5 then thee's nothing else to do for them.
[0:56:13] <+Deepfriedhamster> infinite deliver works
[0:56:18] <VidulaSaix> Yes, Reggie
[0:56:26] <VidulaSaix> There's repeatable deliveries
[0:56:28] <alrobot2014> woolie shall deliver us from evil
[0:56:36] <worldbrand> I like to believe this works with SBR rules and if you get really good at delivering, it just becomes a stand
[0:56:37] <@Solidus_113> The standard orders to start to pop back up
[0:56:59] <+Deepfriedhamster> isn't Sam BB's Stand technically
[0:57:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @deepfriedhamster Strando Powah
[0:57:39] <VidulaSaix> You get Mails for the non important ones
[0:57:54] <+Deepfriedhamster> hoho you're approaching me? I need to get closer to deliver this package.
[0:58:02] <+Deepfriedhamster> then come as close as you like
[0:58:34] <masterfire23> pizza time

[0:59:18] <+Razputin217> Dancing Mad Mads
[0:59:24] <Mothman742> chat do u prefer ur cheese pizzas with blue cheese and anchovies or with gummy worms?
[0:59:32] <+Deepfriedhamster> worms
[0:59:35] <+Deepfriedhamster> gimme the worms
[0:59:36] <peachy996> That one episode of Community where its ABBA Zombie Apocalypse is still hilarious
[0:59:36] <VidulaSaix> A good general rule of thumb is that once you've 5 starred someone they wont give you anything unique beyond maybe an email
[0:59:54] <+Deepfriedhamster> i did forget to get the charm from the weather station
[1:00:06] <+Javaa01> Oh yeah, this is simple, just go nade some BTs and grab their crystals, then go drop those crystals off at the destination
[1:00:06] <@Solidus_113> use the grenades as a test
[1:00:12] <VidulaSaix> Thats the main mission
[1:00:21] <VidulaSaix> Not the one you're on
[1:00:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's the damn test run grenade tutorial
[1:00:32] <+Javaa01> You don't need to fight a boss for this, the regular floating BTs are enough
[1:00:45] <VidulaSaix> Yeah this is the tutorial mission lol
[1:00:49] <%Irridium> yeah finally test the grenades you've been using most of the game already
[1:01:12] <@Solidus_113> this is why you read the mission log
[1:01:20] <@Solidus_113> It's a tutorial mission
[1:01:26] <+Javaa01> This is a tutorial mission from earlier on in the game
[1:01:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:28] <VidulaSaix> Because it's the Tutorial Mission. Go To The BT Area is the main mission on the other continent @WoolieVersus
[1:01:39] <Tuna_Can_0> I also did this mission in the late game LUL
[1:01:52] <+Deepfriedhamster> same
[1:01:53] <worldbrand> LUL
[1:01:57] <worldbrand> same im pretty sure
[1:02:12] <+Deepfriedhamster> this mission emned up fucking me hard though
[1:02:20] <peachy996> find a jelly
[1:02:36] <%Solidnick18> LIGHTING
[1:02:41] <%Irridium> VANILLA ICE?!
[1:02:45] <%Solidnick18> PogChamp
[1:02:53] <Tuna_Can_0> monkaS
[1:02:54] <%Solidnick18> i saw it
[1:02:58] <%Irridium> I actually saw that once in my game as well. No fucking clue what it is.
[1:03:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> lIGHTNING rETURNS
[1:03:03] <+Deepfriedhamster> i went BT hunting in the snow once
[1:03:04] <%Irridium> saw it in the mountains
[1:03:07] <+Deepfriedhamster> shit gets cray
[1:03:20] <ALTRNico> !uptime
[1:03:21] <VidulaSaix> Looked like a visual glitch
[1:03:22] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 14 minutes
[1:03:23] <+Deepfriedhamster> i went looking for rare BTs
[1:03:24] <VidulaSaix> Just looked at it
[1:03:26] <+linSP> what would chiral lightning do to you monkaS
[1:03:27] <+Deepfriedhamster> neer foudn any though
[1:03:29] <%supersugoisenpai1> I believe that's other player's stuff being dropped in your world, I've seen it on my ziplines
[1:03:30] <+Javaa01> Nah, they're a bit further in I think
[1:03:54] <%LordSDB> Woolie doing a genocider run?! PogChamp
[1:04:04] <ALTRNico> Woolie's back in the first area?
[1:04:05] <red_blaster> That lightning was another player's cargo dropping into your world. There is a little animation for it.
[1:04:09] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @bevyrage
[1:04:11] <@Solidus_113> closer to the water
[1:04:13] <%Irridium> Think they hang just in the eastern part of the circle
[1:04:23] <bevyrage> aw, not even clips
[1:04:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @linsp That's how you make a Frankenstein's monster, or a Heartman
[1:04:35] <Djinnazz> go towards the water
[1:04:55] <BurdRightsActivist> Why did wools go all the way back? Lol
[1:04:56] <+Javaa01> I think collecting the crystals is enough to complete the objective, if you've already cleared the area out
[1:05:01] <+Neale2theMusic> Reading up now that lightning was the game spawning lost cargo from another world
[1:05:09] <+Deepfriedhamster> did you know that ancient humans drank water
[1:05:18] <+Deepfriedhamster> Sam dont you think thats interesting
[1:05:18] <VidulaSaix> Yeah I'm pretty sure you can't do this anymore cause you killed it LUL
[1:05:20] <%Who_lio42> SE in the circle
[1:05:29] <worldbrand> whaat
[1:05:32] <+Mkingston> It's true
[1:05:34] <arkv01> isekai cargo
[1:05:36] <%Irridium> cargo getting isakai'd
[1:05:37] <alrobot2014> isecargo
[1:05:48] <@Solidus_113> grab crystals
[1:05:52] <@Solidus_113> this is the actual mission
[1:05:52] <arkv01> all the cargo you drop down cliffs...
[1:05:54] <red_blaster> Yeah, there is a little animation for another player's cargo showing up in your world.
[1:06:04] <%Solidnick18> idk
[1:06:18] <thebushmanisback> It always freaked me out how much that bracelet gets treated like billys cuffs from re-0
[1:06:23] <+Deepfriedhamster> i want a chiral Katana
[1:06:37] <%Who_lio42> SE in the circle irrc
[1:06:45] <+Deepfriedhamster> Katana means japanese Strand
[1:06:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> RACE WAR WOOLIE AT IT AGAIN
[1:06:53] <%supersugoisenpai1> I don't think this mission gives you anything anyway
[1:07:00] <arkv01> BT APARTHEID
[1:07:03] <VidulaSaix> Just abandon. Pretty sure you've 100%'d this contient
[1:07:04] <chiazam> Did Woolie change his mind about Spec Ops today?
[1:07:06] <Soulbishop> South East. . .
[1:07:08] <%Irridium> south-east?
[1:07:09] <+Javaa01> Yeah, that should probably be enough, check the delivery point and drop off the crystals
[1:07:16] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.
[1:07:19] <+Javaa01> You don't need to abandon it though
[1:07:27] <+Mkingston> @Deepfriedhamster Like we wanted to unlock the Katana in MGS2 and use it in NG+.
[1:07:51] <+Deepfriedhamster> playing throough Death stranded with spoilers ON must be weird
[1:07:52] <%Who_lio42> yeah weird they must be gone.
[1:07:57] <%Irridium> you can go further south. maybe. hopefully.
[1:07:59] <VidulaSaix> Boy this episode is going to play GREAT on Youtube LUL
[1:08:13] <+Deepfriedhamster> its fiiine
[1:08:17] <Djinnazz> You would have seen them by now
[1:08:22] <+Deepfriedhamster> just see if you can deliver tsome crystals
[1:08:29] <%LordSDB> Woolie will make you extinct chat
[1:08:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:08:33] <%Solidnick18> woolies just to strong now
[1:08:33] <ALTRNico> can you not restart the mission in the Order menu?
[1:08:37] <%LordSDB> Don't test this man
[1:08:39] <@Solidus_113> guess this is just roaming timefall and not a BT-caused one
[1:08:40] <+thesw1tch> such is the totality of life
[1:08:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try another BT zone?
[1:08:44] <peachy996> They're KNOT coming back?
[1:08:50] <VidulaSaix> haHAA
[1:08:51] <+Deepfriedhamster> also if he rests at a time shelter, wont they respaqn
[1:08:51] <+Javaa01> Yeah, just check the end delivery point and go drop off those crystals there, should be enough to cross this mission off considering how many crystals you got here
[1:08:54] <Soulbishop> I would say rest first then see if that triggers a respawn
[1:08:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie "BT Cleansing" Madden
[1:09:00] <AceOne5> why Knot
[1:09:02] <Djinnazz> Central
[1:09:09] <VidulaSaix> Its really not worth all this effort. It's just a tutorial mission LUL
[1:09:25] <+Deepfriedhamster> I'm telling you this mission also fucked me
[1:09:28] <@Solidus_113> the order is in your menu
[1:09:38] <+Mkingston> Oh, I remember this. It was raining and had BTs in this area for me.
[1:09:39] <+Deepfriedhamster> execute order 66
[1:09:42] <+Deepfriedhamster> BT genocide
[1:10:04] <+linSP> wait tutorial? doesnt it require him make a postbox in the circle
[1:10:13] <VidulaSaix> There's multiple
[1:10:17] <+Deepfriedhamster> no, its to test the blood bombs
[1:10:25] <VidulaSaix> A good general rule of thumb is that once you've 5 starred someone they wont give you anything unique beyond maybe an email
[1:10:39] <+Javaa01> Basically every new gadget has a tutorial
[1:10:39] <+Deepfriedhamster> #pizza time
[1:10:47] <+linSP> ohhh, cant do the mission if all the ghosts are dead :(
[1:10:51] <+Mkingston> Yep. Once 5 starred abandon them.
[1:11:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> UCK IT QUADRUPLE JUMP
[1:11:11] <VidulaSaix> Just jump 4Head
[1:11:19] <worldbrand> triple jump but two of those jumps are actual supernatural double jumps
[1:11:30] <+Mkingston> How to make Lara naked back in the day
[1:11:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> MOONJUMP THO
[1:11:33] <%LordSDB> Now I want to see woolie play Lighting Return, just to see him do a full genocide run on that
[1:11:36] <+Deepfriedhamster> slam dunk BB for style points
[1:11:51] <alrobot2014> if someone did a real life double jump i'd give em an award
[1:11:56] <+BioHunter> bad analogy is bad lol
[1:11:57] <@Solidus_113> back to pizza town
[1:11:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> But there's skill and technique to how you spring off of the landing and conserve momentum.
[1:12:03] <ALTRNico> getting the pole in the hole?
[1:12:07] <%Solidnick18> pole in the hole
[1:12:11] <arkv01> pole and hole huh :)
[1:12:16] <%Irridium> pizza pizza
[1:12:20] <+Deepfriedhamster> pole the hole to get the right angle
[1:12:22] <+Mkingston> He has a pizza mission available?
[1:12:28] <+NotHereToStream> pizza time
[1:12:33] <dukenux> does triple jump makes you jump farther than long jump?
[1:12:49] <+Mkingston> Space Jump
[1:12:52] <+Javaa01> Most sports have dumb arbitrary rules, triple jump just puts in the name
[1:12:55] <+Deepfriedhamster> triple jump into my arms
[1:13:08] <arkv01> wht about that one anime where robots played basketball
[1:13:10] <mr_sups> Basketball but with 3 balls.
[1:13:17] <+BoBoGaijin> each jump could go in different directions though sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[1:13:27] <worldbrand> yo i would watch that
[1:13:30] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:13:35] <peachy996> Multi-Ball
[1:13:35] <+Mkingston> Have you seen Slam Ball?
[1:13:39] <+Deepfriedhamster> did you know the spear in spear throwing has been designed to be less effective so that its more difficult to hit a far distance
[1:13:41] <%jiggy_snipe> that would be nuts
[1:13:46] <ALTRNico> Woolie "three balls sounds fun" Madden
[1:13:48] <dukenux> more like 2 balls and 4 goals
[1:13:48] <arkv01> hell yeah dodge ball basketball edition
[1:13:49] <@Solidus_113> Farm?
[1:13:52] <VidulaSaix> Farm
[1:13:55] <%Irridium> timefall farm?
[1:13:55] <Djinnazz> FARM
[1:13:56] <+Mkingston> The farm
[1:13:57] <+Deepfriedhamster> #farm pizza
[1:14:02] <Soulbishop> I wonder. . . what's the oxygen concentration is like in the world at this point
[1:14:05] <+Deepfriedhamster> this one sucks if its the farm
[1:14:09] <+Sebenoth> timefall farm
[1:14:14] <%Irridium> oh this gonna be fun
[1:14:14] <@Solidus_113> Check around the farm for a safe house, there's usually one pretty close
[1:14:18] <+Mkingston> This is the hardest pizza mission
[1:14:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> you can check the last email from Peter
[1:14:23] <Soulbishop> Rainforest cant be putting out max oxygen at this point
[1:14:31] <+drfaustisdead> yeah the farm one is the worst.
[1:14:41] <ALTRNico> Is this the one where you're supposed to carry the champagne?
[1:14:46] <+Deepfriedhamster> shhh
[1:14:50] <%TheSleepParty> Nah the pizza.
[1:15:00] <+Deepfriedhamster> pizza farmers need unions
[1:15:05] <@Solidus_113> You REALLY WANT a speed skeleton for this one
[1:15:06] <%Prevot> most of the oxygen comes from algae, so it depends on how good the oceans are doing
[1:15:22] <worldbrand> three houses PogChamp
[1:15:26] <VidulaSaix> I just said fuck it and took a bike @Solidus_113 LUL

[1:17:13] <+Mkingston> You need nothing on your person
[1:17:13] <+Deepfriedhamster> that Rock is a BT
[1:17:15] <@chesterr01> do we need to see the elder?
[1:17:19] <+agumon9000> No one tells Woolie
[1:17:22] <VidulaSaix> Nah
[1:17:25] <+thesw1tch> no the mules just don't like sam
[1:17:28] <@Solidus_113> nah he's been 5 star for a long time
[1:17:30] <VidulaSaix> Just do pizza stuff
[1:17:33] <%Irridium> if you deliver a package to him something neat happens

[1:17:44] <+Deepfriedhamster> like he fucking should
[1:17:48] <@chesterr01> SeemsGood
[1:17:49] <+thesw1tch> you teabagged them earlier. of course theyre coming after you

[1:19:23] <+Deepfriedhamster> just carry the pizza
[1:19:26] <@Solidus_113> Carrier would keep it flat
[1:19:37] <+linSP> gotta run fast
[1:19:38] <+drfaustisdead> I just put an XL item in my pack and the pizza stayed flat.
[1:19:41] <+Mkingston> you can't just carry the pizza
[1:19:45] <+Deepfriedhamster> the fun is in having the chance of failure
[1:19:48] <%Black_Machete> carrier and speed skeleton
[1:19:56] <+drfaustisdead> also went with the speed skeleton 3.
[1:20:09] <%Prevot> just pull an uber eats and eat the pizza yourself

[1:22:17] <+Javaa01> Enough to get on the road
[1:22:19] <$laphyrion> It's good 'nuff.
[1:22:19] <%LordSDB> @WoolieVersus watch the door going out

[1:22:36] <+Sebenoth> roads and generators will make it fine
[1:22:41] <+Mkingston> Just run around the mules
[1:22:41] <peachy996> Your feet are getting pretty relaxed with all those vehicles and ziplines, it'd be a shame if you had to hand deliver something Kappa
[1:22:41] <+Razputin217> PIZZA TIME
[1:22:45] <+Deepfriedhamster> Forrest gump the game
[1:22:48] <vVAstrAVv> battery recharges even if it dies

[1:23:02] <%LordSDB> Watch out for rocks
[1:23:04] <@Solidus_113> Wow, didn't expect to hear Billy Talent today
[1:23:06] <+Mkingston> How many hours has Woolie put into this game?
[1:23:15] <peachy996> many
[1:23:17] <@Solidus_113> like 150
[1:23:29] <+Deepfriedhamster> i ended at 135 hrs
[1:23:34] <+Razputin217> Barry Sanders that pizza
[1:23:37] <+Deepfriedhamster> probably couldve done it in 60
[1:23:39] <+Mkingston> I ended at 63
[1:23:39] <Djinnazz> did you bould all the roads?
[1:23:57] <+Deepfriedhamster> i spent 2 hours in the snow before unlocking mountain knot
[1:24:03] <+Javaa01> You should be able to outrun them
[1:24:08] <chronoxgp> i ended at 60
[1:24:10] <%Prevot> alexa play run run rottytops
[1:24:11] <+Mkingston> I didn't build everything and only 5 starred about 3 people
[1:24:25] <+Deepfriedhamster> anyone done a newgame + with spoilers on?
[1:24:37] <%LordSDB> Woolie been going for 5 staring people so yeah he's been at it
[1:24:40] <+Deepfriedhamster> you really dont need to 5 star anyone
[1:24:44] <chronoxgp> I did the whole game without online or the HUD, it was great, lost track of time
[1:24:45] <AceOne5> not yet no
[1:24:53] <+Deepfriedhamster> no HUD?
[1:24:54] <+Mkingston> I had spoilers on throughout my first run. Never got spoiled.
[1:25:00] <+Deepfriedhamster> really
[1:25:01] <%Irridium> should be fine if you just go straight north
[1:25:10] <peachy996> Reluctantly crouched at the starting line Engines pumping and thumping in time
[1:25:10] <%Irridium> follow the coast
[1:25:14] <%Who_lio42> theres a shallow path infront of the waterfall
[1:25:15] <+Deepfriedhamster> thats so weird i wouldve hoped the mpa blew up with ziplines int he first mission
[1:25:19] <chronoxgp> the entire game is color/auditory you don't need HUD at all
[1:25:35] <+Deepfriedhamster> i like knowing my bbs mood
[1:25:46] <%LordSDB> Making the game harder can be really fun @Deepfriedhamster I like playing some shooters without huds when I can. But not all of them
[1:26:03] <+Deepfriedhamster> hmm
[1:26:08] <chronoxgp> lol you do the same thing with BB regardless of whether or not you have a guage on the screen
[1:26:09] <+Deepfriedhamster> maybe ill try that in future
[1:26:14] <%LordSDB> Woolie where are you going....
[1:26:16] <chronoxgp> jus drop everything you're doing to shake him
[1:26:20] <peachy996> He's going the distance, he's going for speed
[1:26:20] <%Who_lio42> noo goood path
[1:26:29] <+Mkingston> so much sprinting. Hope he doesn't fall.
[1:26:31] <+Deepfriedhamster> let him walk

[1:26:47] <+Deepfriedhamster> omg pizza hthrough BT territory
[1:26:48] <ALTRNico> lmao
[1:26:53] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:26:53] <ALTRNico> just cross the river
[1:26:56] <@Solidus_113> You wanna go through the weather station
[1:26:59] <%LordSDB> All this running is making the pizza nervous
[1:27:00] <Djinnazz> no you don't
[1:27:07] <%Irridium> this is where the fun happens
[1:27:08] <+Deepfriedhamster> im surprised he didnt go through the weather station
[1:27:15] <+Deepfriedhamster> but this si more interesting
[1:27:29] <+Sebenoth> that's the point, you're not supposed to know
[1:27:34] <%Who_lio42> you either cut infront of the waterfall, or go to the weather station
[1:27:35] <VidulaSaix> Restarting it wiuld just make it take longer at this point
[1:27:40] <%LordSDB> Cargo container siad ruined
[1:27:49] <%LordSDB> Is that bad
[1:27:50] <+Mkingston> I got this pizza really close to the destination the fell over and didn't get the s rank.
[1:28:04] <+Deepfriedhamster> always bring a pcc for emergency hcarging
[1:28:04] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:28:09] <+Deepfriedhamster> especially early trucking days
[1:28:17] <+Sebenoth> I never used the spare battery, just a network of generators
[1:28:24] <VidulaSaix> Jebaited
[1:28:28] <Djinnazz> yes you can!
[1:28:31] <Djinnazz> go back!
[1:28:34] <+drfaustisdead> you can use crystals to repair them.
[1:28:38] <%LordSDB> good no more super run
[1:28:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Aren't crystals a valid repair material?
[1:28:40] <%Irridium> don't generators just need chiral crystals?
[1:28:41] <+Javaa01> Well, not far to the road now
[1:28:42] <@Solidus_113> The battery will charge in the sun
[1:28:45] <+Deepfriedhamster> does it need materials or just hciral crystals. can i get a confirmation
[1:28:47] <%LordSDB> That was making me way to nervous
[1:28:50] <+JacknZack27> You can use crystals to repair
[1:28:52] <%ECRead> I always have a spare battery on
[1:28:54] <VidulaSaix> This is the TRUE Death Stranding LUL

[1:44:01] <QaizerArt> @MayorRev Yeah he did the pizza mission where you run it all the way from South Knot
[1:44:01] <worldbrand> you will get emails dont sweat it
[1:44:20] <HeroSolaire> Vergil working out there with those generators
[1:44:45] <+Sebenoth> there's a twist if you take an order to the elder after not visiting him for a long time
[1:44:46] <VidulaSaix> You wont
[1:44:46] <+JacknZack27> You can repair with only crystals. You dont need metal
[1:45:13] <+Sebenoth> ...its something Kojima eluded to with "ignoring early game NPCs" as a mechanic
[1:45:19] <%Irridium> if you upgrade it it also heals it completely
[1:45:23] <peachy996> You won't be locked from the pizza mission don't worry
[1:45:24] <Quinnman89> while Upgrading is the optimal way to repair, you can also just dump materials in
[1:46:12] <ALTRNico> main mission go
[1:46:17] <@Solidus_113> This current main isn't a lockoff point
[1:46:20] <worldbrand> it sure is
[1:46:23] <VidulaSaix> Yeah dont worry
[1:46:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> do main story missions for more pizza time
[1:46:25] <VidulaSaix> You've got time
[1:46:29] <peachy996> Yeah you'll be fine
[1:46:30] <VidulaSaix> We'll let you know when you need to back off
[1:47:07] <ALTRNico> what is creativity?
[1:47:15] <+Stupid121v2> Pat made those bikes cause fuck creativity
[1:47:17] <%Jumpie8> Jumpie8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months!
[1:47:20] <+Javaa01> It's all gonna get corroded away in minutes anyways
[1:47:53] <vVAstrAVv> hey some of us prefer to play the game rather than stare at vehicle customizations
[1:47:58] <+JacknZack27> I always go with default color. Too lazy to customize a vehicle that’ll get ditched soon anyway
[1:48:10] <peachy996> What do you think this is Midnight Club 3?
[1:48:16] <%solzan2000> yes

[1:49:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHAT IS THIS STEERING? What are you doing with the sticks?
[1:49:56] <MayorRev> I think it was either Sakurai or Kamiya who said that the game's text was too small
[1:50:04] <@Solidus_113> it was everyone
[1:50:06] <MayorRev> lol
[1:50:09] <worldbrand> nah ive fallen off
[1:50:42] <VidulaSaix> Oh my god LUL
[1:50:43] <+drfaustisdead> I think one of the updates made it so you don't just go flying off the road, I noticed it myself a few days ago.
[1:50:46] <worldbrand> LUL
[1:50:56] <MayorRev> Modern problems require modern solutions
[1:51:09] <GodKingReiss> Is there any practical reason why only the middle of the road is a power grid and not just the whole thing?
[1:51:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:51:19] <@Solidus_113> Ultra Truckin

[1:59:35] <@Solidus_113> and it's an instant game over when that happens
[1:59:37] <+Javaa01> Look at the actual topology
[1:59:46] <AceOne5> wooow I though this whole time the game just didnt trigger it
[2:00:19] <+Mkingston> I'd love Woolie to come across something of Pat's and delete it

[2:00:25] <Quinnman89> you can, you just can't be using a zip line. oh noo
[2:00:25] <AceOne5> you can delete actually but it doesnt free up bandwith

[2:01:12] <%Who_lio42> woolie says this as he passed a cratered area
[2:01:26] <vVAstrAVv> i heard its not "permanent but a long time probably
[2:01:27] <@Solidus_113> He means what I just replied to
[2:01:28] <derap41> yeah the craters on the world map are void outs
[2:01:30] <VidulaSaix> Its permanent
[2:01:31] <derap41> and some nukes
[2:01:40] <@Solidus_113> He means killing MULEs and terrorists
[2:01:43] <ALTRNico> well no
[2:01:45] <AceOne5> Kojima has always been very anti-kill
[2:01:48] <@Solidus_113> the answer is no
[2:01:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they return
[2:01:49] <worldbrand> thinking emoji
[2:01:53] <MayorRev> LUL
[2:01:55] <AceOne5> you often get rewarded for doing so
[2:02:02] <+linSP> everytime you get dragged by a bt, where you appear will turn into a hole if you die
[2:02:03] <VidulaSaix> Not quite. The voidouts are only possible in BT areas
[2:02:09] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus mules, no the become new BTs
[2:02:16] <+drfaustisdead> I just had a MULE just die for no reason once.
[2:02:29] <VidulaSaix> 2 hours later we're back where we started
[2:02:35] <VidulaSaix> I love this game LUL

[2:03:38] <peachy996> Empty your load
[2:03:42] <worldbrand> video's haunted
[2:03:44] <duskrush> oh shit he's got the mission to get to the edge of the tar lake?
[2:03:46] <+NotHereToStream> Kojima is like no spoiler plz
[2:03:47] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie Will Manage the Data.
[2:03:58] <ALTRNico> recording is haunted by BT
[2:03:59] <VidulaSaix> Definitely sounds like a capacity issue
[2:04:00] <Riorii> yeah luckily worst case you have the vod
[2:05:13] <derap41> Spec ops?
[2:05:24] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.

[2:06:21] <+johnny_gogo> Fuck
[2:06:21] <%wydamn> Tell minh to recreate the footage with stickman drawings.
[2:06:23] <%jiggy_snipe> can you throw up the twitch vod?
[2:06:26] <arkv01> good thing we have strim footage these days
[2:06:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Minh can save it via stream footage?
[2:06:28] <+Mkingston> You're not a professional streamer unless you have technical problems
[2:06:33] <VidulaSaix> Facts
[2:06:37] <+linSP> at least theres twitch vod
[2:06:43] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:06:47] <arkv01> time to get a new SD card rip
[2:06:47] <+Stupid121v2> $$$
[2:06:51] <VidulaSaix> No backups around the house?
[2:06:54] <OldManDeckardCain> enemies from within SabaPing
[2:06:56] <derap41> bad sectors on SD card are a nightmare
[2:07:19] <arkv01> finally, the time of VOD supremacy has arrived
[2:07:19] <+Stupid121v2> Its the principal
[2:07:21] <@Solidus_113> Does anything get shut down when you finish recording?
[2:07:22] <%wydamn> Must be one of those Sansumg brand SD cards.
[2:07:55] <+Mkingston> Dammit Billy
[2:08:02] <+snarfton23> Play Uno for the rest of the stream
[2:08:11] <Quinnman89> :(
[2:08:23] <%Solidnick18> shit
[2:08:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Hey man it's like when a pigeon decides to randomly shit on you ya know
[2:08:30] <%ChoculaUltra> you mean inhuman error?!
[2:08:36] <%The_Timo> Lol No given reason. I wish technical problems came with Given reasons lol
[2:08:38] <%25RPM> Sorry guys i hope you get it fixed!
[2:08:39] <%DaOsoMan> DaOsoMan subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:08:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is what happens when you trust technology
[2:08:46] <AceOne5> exactly Reggie
[2:08:47] <derap41> Bad sectors on SD card are the worst because you can just have a couple mb of bad space and it completly fuckj the whole think
[2:08:53] <worldbrand> I had this happen recently where the problem was just dust, but it still took me like 20 minutes to figure that out
[2:08:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> TIMEFALL ATE YOUR SD CARD
[2:08:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Technology was a mistake
[2:08:59] <@Solidus_113> It's always nice to have the stream backup at times like this, so that's one good thing about streaming LPs
[2:09:02] <%DaOsoMan> wheres wollie?
[2:09:04] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:09:05] <derap41> an HDD can at least isolate and igore bad sectors
[2:09:10] <duskrush> Entertain us, Reggie
[2:09:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> We expected nothing and the SD card recorded even less
[2:09:20] <%DaOsoMan> thats reggie?
[2:09:22] <%DaOsoMan> huh
[2:09:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dance Reggie
[2:09:31] <%ChoculaUltra> anywho - ya'll heard that Shounen Jump and Kubo Tite are announcing something at AnimeJapan2020 for Bleach's 20th anniversary? They got a website and animated short up and errthang. Thousand Year Blood War Arc animated?!
[2:09:38] <Frostydough1> But who will fill my BT shaped hole :/
[2:09:53] <duskrush> Tell us about French schools
[2:09:54] <+Mkingston> It's full of hentai
[2:09:55] <+BoBoGaijin> full of PORN
[2:09:55] <%Prevot> big pornz
[2:09:58] <%wydamn> Make sure to rewind the tape before you start recording video again.
[2:09:59] <VidulaSaix> Horse Porn
[2:10:06] <%Prevot> short haired tomboy hentai
[2:10:09] <+Taglog7> New deathnote
[2:10:24] <%Solidnick18> lord daisuke PogChamp
[2:10:29] <@Solidus_113> that dash is WACK
[2:10:31] <VidulaSaix> Make absolutely sure there's nothing important on it before you delete it
[2:10:42] <+BoBoGaijin> its not as bad as it looks
[2:10:44] <%Solidnick18> that air dash is like dah fuck
[2:10:59] <+BoBoGaijin> you can do different versions of the dash
[2:11:05] <+NotHereToStream> you can cancel the IAD into an attack
[2:11:08] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you can cancel it into an attack way more suddenly
[2:11:13] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:11:13] <+NotHereToStream> it cancels the momentum instantly
[2:11:17] <%LordSDB> Sounds stronger to me
[2:11:21] <%wydamn> space animals ruin everything
[2:11:24] <+Stupid121v2> "good."
[2:11:33] <+snarfton23> Reggie got shook
[2:11:53] <+NotHereToStream> I don't know man, a giant magic circle is so noticable
[2:11:58] <@Solidus_113> I didn't notice any IAD's in the new footage either
[2:13:12] <VidulaSaix> Yteserdays session was over 5 hours though
[2:13:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:13:38] <@Solidus_113> Big story stuff is starting to happen too, you really don't want this footage to go bad
[2:13:38] <Naho_Saenoki> !MOTIVATED
[2:13:39] <@Moobot> 585 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:13:51] <peachy996> big sad
[2:13:52] <+Javaa01> Well, thankfully there's only two variables here
[2:13:56] <arkv01> USB ASMR Kreygasm
[2:14:08] <%wydamn> "This SD Card cannot be read. Error 375: SD Card is actually just a piece of cardboard."
[2:14:13] <Wowzerz2> Pat looks different
[2:14:14] <arkv01> but hey we got twitch vods, still gucci
[2:14:21] <+NotHereToStream> take a break if you need to, don't force yourself
[2:14:45] <VidulaSaix> With stream vods nothing will ever be lost no matter how bad it goes
[2:14:51] <VidulaSaix> there's always at least that
[2:15:10] <AceOne5> that sucks really bad Woolz sorry broh
[2:15:27] <peachy996> No More Heroes 2 LP was marred by it
[2:15:28] <%Solidnick18> Things don't always go as planned
[2:15:39] <peachy996> Right at Alice Twilight too
[2:15:56] <%DatAsuna> When I made that fake episode for the pazaak comp I lost 16 hours worth of editing near the end
[2:16:02] <+Mkingston> I see shit happen so much to streamers to blame the streamer. Shit happens.
[2:16:02] <%DatAsuna> It was soul crushing lol
[2:16:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie you of all people should know that no one who's a part of this community expect anything more than nothing so feel free to deliver less
[2:16:09] <%Solidnick18> The underwater audio oh jeez
[2:16:16] <AceOne5> emulators must be such a pain in the ass for streaming
[2:16:26] <arkv01> take a break bros
[2:16:29] <VidulaSaix> You're not a fan of any of these chucklefucks if you haven't had to deal with underwater audio
[2:16:33] <VidulaSaix> On multiple occasions LUL
[2:16:47] <+Taglog7> back up the back up
[2:17:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Best Friends history has dealt with all the audio issue types
[2:17:19] <%Solidnick18> Desynced audio is my biggest pev it really bothers me
[2:17:28] <VidulaSaix> Dync is worse than bad audio
[2:17:32] <VidulaSaix> Desync*
[2:17:54] <@Solidus_113> What was the LP that desync'd every time you went to the pause menu
[2:18:03] <+Mkingston> Last night's stream was desynced
[2:18:03] <VidulaSaix> I wanna say Evil Within 1?
[2:18:10] <bevyrage> it wasn't the pause menu, it was the save menu
[2:18:14] <VidulaSaix> Oh FFX
[2:18:15] <%ChoculaUltra> oh dear lord, Netflix just confirmed they're going to be the ones behind the Live Action One Piece. Is this the failed hero timeline?
[2:18:50] <+JacknZack27> I hope they take their inspiration from the 4kids dub
[2:18:57] <+snarfton23> Sounds good
[2:18:59] <pirateofpie> They were confirmed to be involved with that a while ago, I thought
[2:19:09] <XzileGaming> riveting gameplay
[2:19:09] <%LordSDB> At least Gintama had a good live action
[2:19:26] <VidulaSaix> I'd say take a glance up to the recording every 10-15 minutes to make sure its recording
[2:19:28] <%ChoculaUltra> confirmed as in like, it's actually good to go and start filming. Even had a note written by Oda to go along with the tweet.
[2:19:37] <pirateofpie> Oh
[2:19:37] <XzileGaming> entertain us reg
[2:19:47] <ALTRNico> yes
[2:19:47] <+Mkingston> Have you seen the trailers for Netflix's Ghost in the Shell 2045?
[2:19:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DANCE
[2:19:55] <%Solidnick18> yeye
[2:19:56] <+Taglog7> YEYEYE
[2:19:59] <%ChoculaUltra> and from the sound of the wording - it might be a show format instead of a movie/film
[2:20:02] <%Solidnick18> LOL
[2:20:04] <VidulaSaix> Death Note Live Action was pretty good too. The Japanese ones
[2:20:06] <XzileGaming> too sexy for twitch
[2:20:07] <+BoBoGaijin> dance!
[2:20:07] <+Taglog7> Dance Stream Wen?
[2:20:08] <ALTRNico> no dance? :(
[2:20:09] <OldManDeckardCain> DEMON DEFEATED
[2:20:23] <+Stupid121v2> Explain boys
[2:20:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[2:20:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> Fucking thing sucks! Do it live!
[2:20:35] <duskrush> Do you know of the stuff that KH3's been implying or are you avoiding spoilers?
[2:20:35] <+Taglog7> Behind the Scenes
[2:20:42] <%Solidnick18> Great
[2:20:48] <VidulaSaix> He doesnt play KH so no
[2:20:57] <+Stupid121v2> He has 0 interest probably lol
[2:21:07] <duskrush> He might be. There's some stuff
[2:21:07] <XzileGaming> Reggie stream mvp imo
[2:21:11] <+Stupid121v2> I fuckin love the implications
[2:21:15] <+Mkingston> Have you seen the trailers for Netflix's Ghost in the Shell 2045? What did you think?
[2:21:25] <duskrush> Something in particular I know he's interested in
[2:21:34] <%ChoculaUltra> that incomplete KH playthrough on the SBFP channel still hurts like a fresh wound :(
[2:21:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Heartmans the real villain
[2:21:43] <VidulaSaix> Ursula won
[2:22:04] <XzileGaming> ever since mega man 3 Hard Man has been studying the blade
[2:22:34] <+snarfton23> Yeah sucks KH was never finished
[2:22:43] <Mayachacha> we still in chapter 8?
[2:22:47] <duskrush> I feel like if Woolie knew he might be in
[2:22:58] <%The_Timo> PCCs for Zipline build on the way back, unless this is the final push
[2:23:00] <+Stupid121v2> Woolie playing KH2 is still the pipe dream I want
[2:23:01] <duskrush> Join the cult of Kingdom Hearts
[2:23:26] <VidulaSaix> Going through the KH3 Data fights and just thinking how much Woolie would love that hype shit
[2:23:33] <VidulaSaix> Shame the series itself is SUPER not his thing
[2:23:35] <Djinnazz> do you not rmember the last time they played KH???
[2:23:35] <duskrush> He really would
[2:23:38] <VidulaSaix> The gameplay in KH2 and KH3 is dope
[2:23:42] <+Stupid121v2> Its gameplay would appeal directly to him
[2:24:00] <duskrush> replace style switch with form change
[2:24:06] <duskrush> or drive
[2:24:09] <%ChoculaUltra> KH2 is still considered, in a lot of circles, a character action game
[2:24:17] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:24:20] <%ChoculaUltra> probably the tightest gameplay of the whole series.
[2:24:45] <arkv01> uh h stinky!
[2:24:47] <ALTRNico> good thing you have floating carrier
[2:24:49] <VidulaSaix> I know Liam's tried pushing it on both Woolie and Matt
[2:24:52] <VidulaSaix> To no avail LUL
[2:24:54] <%The_Timo> carrier time
[2:24:59] <Tucker0603> CARRIER
[2:25:08] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's a big order
[2:25:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> if youre lucky, you can find a truck midway and truck through it
[2:25:15] <duskrush> I know Liam tried pushing Chain of Memories
[2:25:22] <duskrush> but idk if he ever brought up KH2
[2:25:34] <VidulaSaix> He brought it up on camera to Matt more than once
[2:25:49] <arkv01> card game month origins
[2:25:55] <XzileGaming> JENGA
[2:25:58] <+Javaa01> You can honestly just get rid of the handguns at this point
[2:26:05] <Djinnazz> you're carrying way too many duplicates.
[2:26:08] <VidulaSaix> Carriers are king here
[2:26:18] <ALTRNico> no carrier? :(
[2:26:38] <duskrush> Kingdom Hearts will get Woolie one day
[2:26:44] <TigerClaws12> !schedule
[2:26:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[2:26:46] <VidulaSaix> very seriously doubt it
[2:26:50] <+Stupid121v2> KH to outsiders looks fucking horrendous and stupid its so hard to convince people its kino
[2:27:02] <%ChoculaUltra> it really is
[2:27:04] <VidulaSaix> KH to fans is horrendous and stupid
[2:27:08] <VidulaSaix> But its charming in its stupidity
[2:27:12] <duskrush> When the hope of character action fails and he's hungry for something new
[2:27:13] <+Stupid121v2> thats fair tbh
[2:27:15] <%The_Timo> at the cost of being ill-prepared, he's going for speed. hm
[2:27:23] <TigerClaws12> spec ops later or?
[2:27:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:27:26] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.
[2:27:30] <+Stupid121v2> Nah rescheduled

[2:27:45] <%Who_lio42> take off the armor for space
[2:27:51] <XzileGaming> Woolie, take a block from the bottom and put it on top. then, after that, take a block from the middle and put it on top. respectively, thats how you build a tower, you just dont stop, taking blocks from the middle and put them all on top.
[2:27:52] <%ChoculaUltra> stupidly charming! Nomura could sneeze on a napkin and I'd be analyzing that shit for lore significance smh.
[2:27:59] <+Stupid121v2> terrorist bt's
[2:28:07] <arkv01> mmm norman goo-dus
[2:28:11] <duskrush> I don't think he needs that much protection this far in
[2:28:42] <duskrush> plus when you get where you need to go you probably don't want that much on you
[2:28:46] <+Stupid121v2> Once you get to your destination you wot have to worry much about gear.
[2:28:52] <VidulaSaix> Friendly reminder to glance up at the recording
[2:29:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> 300 crystals i think
[2:29:41] <Djinnazz> it's right there on the screen...

[2:36:29] <worldbrand> prosecco's okay, but making bellinis with it? ace

[2:47:00] <%DatAsuna> we are
[2:47:04] <%DatAsuna> nacho kind of people
[2:47:08] <duskrush> if you think about it, pizza is a salad
[2:47:21] <Nomad94> so, where are we story-wise?
[2:47:25] <@Solidus_113> Mount Knot
[2:47:26] <ALTRNico> mountain
[2:47:26] <VidulaSaix> Tar Belt
[2:47:29] <+Javaa01> Nah, Mountain Side Distro Center

[2:47:30] <duskrush> Tar Belt
[2:47:32] <%supersugoisenpai1> mountain knot
[2:47:35] <%thechungiestofbois> Heartmans chapter
[2:47:40] <VidulaSaix> We're WAY past mountain knot Solidus
[2:47:51] <VidulaSaix> Oh you mean the pizza
[2:47:55] <duskrush> He had the delivery mission for the one before the tar belt
[2:47:58] <duskrush> but pizza first
[2:47:59] <masterfire23> so how does sam not age with the snow touching his face
[2:48:02] <@Solidus_113> remember the name of this safe hose
[2:48:03] <@Solidus_113> house
[2:48:23] <chronoxgp> it's south of mount knot
[2:48:33] <%thechungiestofbois> Wait
[2:48:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:48:37] <Nomad94> @masterfire23 ignore snow touching his face during gameplay; canonically his hood is always up when it needs to
[2:48:43] <VidulaSaix> SeemsGood
[2:48:46] <%thechungiestofbois> Fragile doesn’t bring the pizza with her
[2:49:13] <Nomad94> I can't wait for the Yeah Boyeee video to get to YT
[2:49:18] <Nomad94> best scene
[2:49:20] <VidulaSaix> I cant believe this whole session is only going to result in delivering pizzas LUL
[2:49:26] <peachy996> right in yer face
[2:49:30] <Nomad94> @VidulaSaix Only? SwiftRage
[2:49:32] <duskrush> as it should be
[2:49:50] <VidulaSaix> This ones real easy
[2:49:56] <@Solidus_113> the challenge is that it's far away
[2:50:00] <%thechungiestofbois> No lie. This game made me drink Monster
[2:50:11] <%The_Timo> Time for Trucking
[2:50:17] <ALTRNico> good thing you already built roads and ziplines
[2:50:23] <Nomad94> @Solidus_113 I read that as "tar away"
[2:50:27] <+Javaa01> No massive gimmicks on this one, just pack it on your back and grab a bike
[2:50:28] <Nomad94> also not inaccurate tho.
[2:50:35] <duskrush> like Norman Reedus?
[2:50:38] <VidulaSaix> Yeah just bike it
[2:50:44] <@Solidus_113> just make one

[2:50:59] <%Solidnick18> RIDE
[2:51:03] <duskrush> with Norman Reedus
[2:51:04] <Nomad94> love it when the game makes you haul HUGE loads for miles that don't workk with ziplines.
[2:51:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Way to go speed demon
[2:51:11] <Nomad94> *work
[2:51:17] <%Solidnick18> catch a RIDE with norman reedus
[2:51:26] <%thechungiestofbois> I feel so fucking cool right now
[2:51:35] <duskrush> borderlands really messed up with not having that marketing
[2:51:52] <Nomad94> Still haven't had a can of Monster in my life
[2:51:58] <Nomad94> don't plan to
[2:52:12] <%thechungiestofbois> The basic flavour is terrible
[2:52:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> Now that's a lot of blood
[2:52:27] <%thechungiestofbois> The no sugar ones and the teas are pretty good
[2:52:29] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Standard Monster isn't great.
[2:52:30] <Cykron> @nomad94 It’s for the best
[2:53:00] <Meatbomb83> tried Moth
[2:53:07] <Meatbomb83> Mother
[2:53:11] <Cykron> THAT’S A LOTTA BAGS

[2:54:09] <BlacSoul> kung pow the goat
[2:54:12] <FaytxStay> This is great.
[2:54:53] <VidulaSaix> Once you deliver this one you can just safehouse back to the geologist
[2:54:55] <worldbrand> but it's comfy. what a cozy stream
[2:54:57] <Nomad94> at least you have roads. I didn't build any.
[2:55:27] <peachy996> Imagine racing on those streets
[2:55:30] <yousayyugi> :3
[2:55:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> I can't believe he stops like that on every other turn. Does he not know how to do subtle angles on the stick?
[2:55:32] <Nomad94> Woolie's going for a Persona Postgame Party, eh?
[2:55:35] <@Solidus_113> teleporting back to where he left the main mission would be where to go
[2:55:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:56:45] <+linSP> this is the filler anime arc right before the season end
[2:56:58] <Nomad94> I guess we ain't getting to the tar belt today
[2:57:02] <peachy996> He's also Scud
[2:57:06] <peachy996> From Blade 2
[2:57:09] <RunningNGunning> Out of curiosity I checked to see what a Death Stranding speedrun looks like, that shit is hilarious
[2:57:10] <ALTRNico> rip Scud
[2:57:11] <Cykron> But the Pizza tho
[2:57:16] <@Solidus_113> Real gamers knew him from Walking Dead Survival Instincts
[2:57:30] <BlacSoul> He couldve been known as a Silent Hill Protag.... KONAMI
[2:57:31] <+TheDeadpoolDash> I remember him most from Boondock Saints
[2:57:34] <DedlokPM> @peachy996 Scud the Disposable Assassin?
[2:57:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Blade 2
[2:57:36] <Nomad94> @RunningNGunning Do they just haul ass all day, or is there actual strategy to it?
[2:57:38] <FaytxStay> ...Speed...Run?
[2:57:43] <VidulaSaix> Sam, I'm a little lost. Could you tell me how cool you feel right now?
[2:57:46] <Cykron> Norman Reedus is a swell guy and can really host a show
[2:57:50] <FaytxStay> This game has a speedrun category?
[2:57:51] <peachy996> Because Guillermo Del Toro directed Blade II
[2:57:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Wait Woolie

[2:58:37] <duskrush> Norman Reedus? From Ride with Norman Reedus?
[2:58:41] <Cykron> Motherfuckers always trying to floating carrier skate up hill
[2:58:48] <VidulaSaix> That happens to so many movies
[2:58:57] <FaytxStay> Sleeperhit?
[2:59:14] <RunningNGunning> @Nomad94 Lots of trip/fall running in the early bits, then using a glitch to basically fly using leaps, then once the vehicles get introduced a lot of driving.
[2:59:21] <RunningNGunning> I only skimmed it though

[3:19:30] <ALTRNico> there's an acheevo for lvl3ing every thing in the pcc
[3:19:31] <VidulaSaix> Not a theory, tahts fact

[3:43:29] <Cykron> Could Reedus be Jesus? apatDab apatDab
[3:43:33] <VidulaSaix> I saw a double rainbow more than once in this game
[3:43:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Anybody know if he's met Heartman yet?
[3:43:35] <+agumon9000> DOUBLE UPSIDEDOWN
[3:43:36] <VidulaSaix> Even a triple once

[3:44:14] <Graxe_> The Cross has joined the UCA
[3:44:17] <+Sebenoth> Kojima's messages are fun because he doesnt try to underplay it
[3:44:20] <BlacSoul> is it a 3rd?
[3:44:29] <+Sebenoth> its like "hey, symbolism, get it!?"
[3:44:30] <Cykron> So anyway I started fasting
[3:44:30] <peachy996> Yeah but Kojima has a silly sense of humor where Snyder doesn't understand humor
[3:44:36] <+drfaustisdead> oh good, this part.
[3:44:37] <alrobot2014> time to get the cross to 5 stars to have a sleep over

[4:53:14] <+NotHereToStream> coping mechanism
[4:53:26] <+therabbles> ah yes an anthropology lesson

[4:59:16] <duskrush> Gir's Doom song from the first episode of Invader Zim
[4:59:23] <+Javaa01> So this interview is just Heartman flexing about having ascended regular humans
[4:59:25] <%The_Timo> Took me way too long to find the right font haha
[4:59:36] <@Solidus_113> @The_Timo If you want the proper DS font it's Sansumi Ultra Light
[4:59:59] <%The_Timo> Not from the sources I foundd, hmmm
[5:00:06] <Djinnazz> they didn't make it, just considered there was one.
[5:00:08] <@Solidus_113> It's the one I used
[5:00:14] <%supersugoisenpai1> Kojima loves his nonsense
[5:00:40] <zenith0111> Tbf Kojima sounds just like my college professors
[5:00:46] <%DensityD> we invented a real afterlife, guess what, it's bad
[5:01:09] <%The_Timo> @Solidus_113 The one I found is pretty spot on, apart from maybe some more formatting

[5:05:48] <zenith0111> Inca is very important to the themes
[5:06:07] <derap41> 90kg of anti matter has the same energi as the tsar bomb
[5:06:10] <zenith0111> Egypt explains the pseudo science

[5:10:15] <zenith0111> @prevot Whatever the case he's spot on
[5:10:46] <zenith0111> No wonder people hated this game LUL too much learning
[5:11:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Which mass extinction event made life evolve to think hydrogen sulfide smells bad? There were giant death clouds of fart gas rolling across the ocean.
[5:11:16] <%jiggy_snipe> it is a lot of reading
[5:11:21] <%LordSDB> Kojima should make a soulsgame then
[5:11:29] <OldManDeckardCain> SabaPing ?
[5:11:48] <%LordSDB> just image the amount of text on jut one weapon like the spoon
[5:12:08] <zenith0111> @generalscpatton Well evolution does take generations to kick in so that's a tough question

[5:14:03] <zenith0111> @peachy996 Can't go in the air. The timefall is the greatest in the atmosphere
[5:14:31] <zenith0111> So Satellites and such got toasted

[5:15:14] <zenith0111> @prevot Hey TierZoo is sophisticated and well researched LUL
[5:15:28] <Graxe_> No one really knows what DOOMS is, other people just started getting it after the Death Stranding
[5:15:31] <%Irridium> Fragile and Heartman
[5:15:34] <Graxe_> *other than
[5:15:57] <Graxe_> Thus, is DOOMS the next stage of evolution
[5:16:08] <%Prevot> the will of D(ooms)
[5:16:15] <zenith0111> DOOMS is more of a themetic title than anything
[5:17:56] <+NotHereToStream> bruh if these were all audio logs while truckin'
[5:18:15] <%LordSDB> Like a lot of science, we learned by pure luck
[5:18:39] <zenith0111> @lordsdb True. A microscope was invented just cause some dude looked down

[5:21:20] <zenith0111> Woolie....
[5:21:20] <%LordSDB> The future is just full of NEETs Kappa
[5:21:20] <VidulaSaix> Being dragged off alive means you're alive when you explode into antimatter
[5:21:20] <+ALazo> Same thing
[5:21:23] <VidulaSaix> Doesnt sound pleasant
[5:21:25] <Laecerelius> No, he would create a BT if his body isn't properly disposed of. A BT has to eat a person to create a voidout
[5:21:29] <redrins> dead=bt, alive=void out
[5:21:31] <%The_Timo> being aged to death slowly lol
[5:21:34] <@Solidus_113> the pain of being consumed by a BT
[5:21:41] <+Javaa01> Nah Woolie, that just makes a regular BT
[5:21:44] <duskrush> Dying doesn't cause a voidout. When a BT (the big ones) eat you it causes a voidout. He was trying to kill himself because if he's dead when it eats him it won't cause a voidout
[5:21:51] <duskrush> Dying just makes more BT's, and therefore more voidout
[5:21:58] <Pappajimbo> the ida i think is ithe dead arnt eatan by bts so it would have dropped him
[5:21:59] <+NotHereToStream> well remember he killed someone out of mercy while being dragged?
[5:22:06] <zenith0111> ???
[5:22:07] <+JacknZack27> Dead would eventually make a bt, but alive is a void out
[5:22:13] <+NotHereToStream> so he hoped killing himself will stop that
[5:22:26] <Djinnazz> You void out, you cease to exsist, no afterlife, no nothing.
[5:22:42] <%Solidnick18> the timefall
[5:23:11] <zenith0111> It's a common question that I'm honestly surprised viewers/players couldn't piece together
[5:23:35] <@Solidus_113> Space Force is useless in Stranding world
[5:23:39] <VidulaSaix> I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter if you're alive of dead. Voidouts are caused by the antimatter coming into contact

[5:25:23] <%Prevot> what about blood type, does that matter too, Kojumbo?
[5:25:30] <VidulaSaix> The game DID tell you before the game even began that DOOMS was based on your birth date @WoolieVersus LUL

[5:26:06] <%supersugoisenpai1> Japanese are obsessed with stars and blood types
[5:26:08] <Graxe_> They told you that in the beginning of the game
[5:26:08] <Laecerelius> Healing crystals are just small amounts of chirilium sending your body back in time to when it was healthy
[5:26:15] <VidulaSaix> Woolie, you're sounding a lot like Pat right now LUL
[5:26:17] <+eanscrale> Same man, same

[5:26:29] <Cykron> Let’s sit in a circlejerk and power up these Chiral Crystals
[5:26:31] <Pappajimbo> well chriliam crystals will have an effect. they will kill you
[5:26:38] <%LordSDB> this is great
[5:26:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> JO crystals get the biggest charge from chokejerking
[5:26:41] <zenith0111> @woolieversus It's not the stereotypical constellations he uses the real ones that people don't talk about.
[5:26:47] <%DensityD> that's a strong effect
[5:27:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Double charge if there's a G O U R D involved
[5:27:06] <VidulaSaix> A bad world view LUL
[5:27:07] <peachy996> You should give that shit the time of day
[5:27:07] <%Prevot> LUL

[5:29:06] <%Solidnick18> Well you are almost done tho
[5:29:06] <VidulaSaix> Alright, so next session you have two options. Either a fairly short stream going over a few chapters that'll be about 2 hours, or you guys will need to settle in for a really long stream of about 7-8 hours, cause once the end game starts there's absolutely no room for a break. That being said you fuys will definitely finish this game next week @WoolieVersus
[5:29:07] <%Prevot> @lordsdb same here, I think
[5:29:10] <zenith0111> @supersugoisenpai1 I need to know!

[5:30:05] <@Solidus_113> there's a lot of cutscenes
[5:30:05] <Djinnazz> 5 at the most
[5:30:06] <%LordSDB> @prevot. Brother woolieCHAN
[5:30:07] <VidulaSaix> No, either a 2 hour stream followed by a 6 hours stream next time
[5:30:09] <VidulaSaix> Or 7-8 total
[5:30:12] <@Solidus_113> like a whole fucking movie
[5:30:12] <VidulaSaix> Yeah woolie has it
[5:30:13] <Cykron> It’s magic, I’m not gonna explain shit
[5:30:14] <%Solidnick18> the cutscenes are very long
[5:30:22] <%Solidnick18> it's a fat movie
[5:30:33] <VidulaSaix> 2 plus cleanup sounds good
[5:30:43] <%jillpilled> it's not usual Kojima beef cutscene length, but it's up there
[5:30:45] <zenith0111> No real "clean up" unless you mean 5 star everyone LUL
[5:30:45] <@Solidus_113> that's right
[5:30:50] <%DensityD> have you heard that Kojima productions is thinking of publishing films? Kappa

[5:31:15] <%DensityD> woohoo pizza man
[5:31:16] <%Irridium> you wanna deliver that pizza
[5:31:18] <@Solidus_113> The last pizza will come at chapter 10, and you can do it during the story section
[5:31:22] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[5:31:27] <%DensityD> gay cowboy that doesn't smoke or swear
[5:31:29] <%jiggy_snipe> pizza should be done on stream
[5:31:32] <%LordSDB> Will Woolie finally get his tip?
[5:31:35] <VidulaSaix> You're more or less done for off stream activities already
[5:31:38] <VidulaSaix> Just a few cleanup
[5:31:41] <zenith0111> First Prepper!!!!
[5:31:41] <%supersugoisenpai1> Next pizza is the payoff
[5:32:19] <+NotHereToStream> vet prepper

[5:32:49] <+NotHereToStream> at the end of the day, sign this please
[5:32:55] <duskrush> quick thing: Dying makes BTs. Getting eaten by BTs does voidouts
[5:33:01] <VidulaSaix> Doing things off stream really helped expediate the process
[5:33:01] <+Javaa01> One for each chapter
[5:33:01] <%Irridium> at the end of the day, choke jerkman
[5:33:21] <+NotHereToStream> bruh, as long as you enjoying it

[5:33:43] <%Solidnick18> yep
[5:33:46] <peachy996> We got some fun stream moments on sidemissions
[5:33:49] <zenith0111> Mainline explains everything you need to know. Everything else is more or less flavor text
