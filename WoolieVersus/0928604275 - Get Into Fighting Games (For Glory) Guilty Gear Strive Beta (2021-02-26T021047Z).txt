[0:02:56] <%JaseAdrift> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:03:02] <%Moonblade92> thinking about it Ky and Pot are the least changed charas and yet also among two of the three strongest in most people's opinion
[0:03:15] <%thedankestmeeme> thedankestmeeme subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! You guys gonna be blazing today?
[0:03:20] <Nekros4442> Reggie you aint fooling anyone just play Ram
[0:03:23] <%Moonblade92> tho everyone says Ram is queen of Strive and she's a new chara basically haha
[0:03:23] <%DkLordG> Playin GG for the first time personally. Trying to main May
[0:03:27] <leith_aziz> For general casuals, give people Goku
[0:03:27] <SGrim> Woolie, remember that while driving your meant to keep your hands at 10 and 2. LUL
[0:03:32] <%krispen_wa> Pot is stronger because everyone else lost moves in the transition while Pot was always a grappler
[0:03:39] <SGrim> you're* FUCK
[0:03:40] <leith_aziz> He'll get people watching
[0:03:41] <Jashter18> I've been maining Ky because I'm a dirty casual who needs to git gud
[0:03:51] <Vaunno> fastest 180 from "ram got gutted" to "yo she busted"
[0:03:53] <%kewlmyc> @DkLordG Funny same here. Something about DOLPHIN COMBOS is really appealing.
[0:03:54] <+Hollow_Mirage> Same Jashter same
[0:04:06] <beatie_g> gotta keep that pressure
[0:04:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[0:04:09] <%Asuterisuku> Multiple characters can just one-shot Chipp.
[0:04:10] <leith_aziz> I tried Nago for some matches. Winning with Nago feels EARNED
[0:04:11] <ThrillingTremors> Nago is so fucking fun
[0:04:14] <+Hollow_Mirage> I wanna try tho Anji
[0:04:14] <+Tai_Gai> I've been going full ape as Leo
[0:04:15] <+xerotwo> doodBigBrain
[0:04:16] <%Javaa01> You have to accept him for what he is, a gorilla with heart disease, where if you push too hard, he just dies
[0:04:17] <leith_aziz> LOVE HIM
[0:04:19] <beatie_g> NagoIN
[0:04:20] <valriot> Apes Strong
[0:04:20] <+rusttyphoon> I heard that Pot is a 10-2 matchup for Nago, Is that true?
[0:04:22] <%DkLordG> @kewlmyc I enjoy smol characters with big weapons
[0:04:25] <DaCheekyOne> "You can block pots heat knuckle. He's gonna be low tier 100%"
[0:04:27] <NotHereToStream> Leo is omega unga
[0:04:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @xerotwo
[0:04:30] <Blank9> Is Nago Woolie's favorite character to play, or just dealing with that because he's making the best of the character he likes?
[0:04:33] <%jepupu> Mid range pokes felt like what he was doing
[0:04:36] <QuadyOfKippleEyes> I’m loving Giovanna’s kit a lot. Mained Faust back in the Closed Beta but man Giovanna clicked so hard with me.
[0:04:39] <ThrillingTremors> Millia flying all around your head, but let me get ONE 2H counterhit and youre done
[0:04:39] <+xerotwo> Gotta COUNTER doodStare
[0:04:39] <%krispen_wa> @blank9 the latter
[0:04:47] <leith_aziz> Leo with brain
[0:04:50] <Jashter18> @blank9 He's running Nago Low or High tier
[0:05:02] <ThrillingTremors> yeah you definitely NEED to convert off counter hits
[0:05:02] <Blank9> damn, that's always rough
[0:05:15] <aka_Jigawatt> !uptime
[0:05:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 10 minutes and 23 seconds
[0:05:26] <metabot64> any open beta announced for pc yet and specs recommended?
[0:05:31] <%krispen_wa> For once, Woolie DIDN'T pick the boss character
[0:05:32] <%Asuterisuku> At least you can BSU to get the rage down if it gets too high.
[0:05:33] <Vaunno> bope
[0:05:33] <DianaTheAscian> oh cool Reggie is here
[0:05:36] <leith_aziz> Such a unique character
[0:05:39] <+EcchiRider> I Smell the game and it smells good lads
[0:05:41] <+xerotwo> Leo seems TOO UNGA doodStare
[0:05:43] <ThrillingTremors> going over blood gauge at the wrong spot feels like you overdrafted your checking account @WoolieVersus
[0:05:48] <Ethrion> pc specs are on the steam page I think
[0:05:52] <+Tai_Gai> Nago's blockstrings are bonkers
[0:05:55] <dizimous> WhyDon'tYouStriveForSomeBitches anyways when is the beta up?
[0:05:55] <chll0ne> theres no boss characters to pick LUL
[0:05:56] <thanosgangthanosgang> Been playing gio a lot. This character has such weird combos and I love it.
[0:05:58] <BlackermanZX> hell yeah Strive drugs doodDrool
[0:06:09] <slim_shady2019> Do you know about the Blood gauge glitch ?
[0:06:15] <Vaunno> @metabot64 nope, but specs are a 8th gen i5 and gtx 660 iirc
[0:06:19] <leith_aziz> Glitch ?
[0:06:22] <DianaTheAscian> Whos Reggie playing?
[0:06:28] <Memitim> @metabot64 no beta for PC most likely, too many datamines
[0:06:30] <leith_aziz> Also Zato has a weird infinite
[0:06:46] <QuadyOfKippleEyes> Is Nagoriyuki a little bit of Slayer mobility with a more punishing Sin Kiske special cancel meter?
[0:06:56] <Memitim> @slim_shady2019 the glitch that woolie tweeted?
[0:07:07] <%Javaa01> @Memitim And probably unfinished PC port
[0:07:08] <bluebreadtoons> Maybe NagoRyuki is not a top tier lol
[0:07:10] <%Asuterisuku> Nago does NOT have Slayer's mobility.
[0:07:13] <%Moonblade92> honestly the only reason why Nago is so bad in Blood is because he has no dash worth a damn. ABA also bled like mad but it didn't matter when Goku Moriah turned her into The Flash
[0:07:15] <leith_aziz> I would say Nago is his own thing
[0:07:15] <%jepupu> Is 6P an universal antiair?
[0:07:16] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[0:07:23] <Vaunno> @jepupu yep
[0:07:24] <+FoxLex_> Yo Woolie
[0:07:29] <%baka_sugoi> 6p upper aa

[0:07:42] <Blank9> shame that Venom's not in
[0:07:44] <leith_aziz> Can you show the wavedash stuff ?
[0:07:44] <bluebreadtoons> NGL losing 9-2 to Pat really makes me think Nago is not a good character lol
[0:07:48] <%jepupu> Yeah finally an Arcsys game with good netcode

[0:08:47] <+xerotwo> Metallica can't even pllay their own music on Blizzcon Twitch stream LUL
[0:08:50] <QuadyOfKippleEyes> Got it, I guess I meant Nago has the command grab bite, the teleport dash, and some mannerisms, less his dash cancels
[0:08:52] <+Nat1Nerd> So which characters are you enjoying so far?
[0:08:54] <%Mrbaconator> i am SOL IN

[0:09:03] <leith_aziz> Thank rollback
[0:09:04] <+xerotwo> so Twitch decides to play 8 bit music over the stream LUL
[0:09:09] <%krispen_wa> Gaara of the Funk...that's a fucking callback...
[0:09:11] <%Asuterisuku> Netcode was the thing keeping me off of Xrd, so I'm glad the online's great.
[0:09:17] <BlackermanZX> Metallica being fucked by dmca is delicious karma LUL
[0:09:20] <Vaunno> pc waiting room gang wya? Sadge

[0:13:40] <leith_aziz> Directional RC helps Pot alot
[0:13:48] <ThrillingTremors> this character is so goddamn sick
[0:13:48] <%baka_sugoi> SNAKE RC
[0:13:50] <+Shishi1205> Pot is so fun to use
[0:13:52] <%krispen_wa> @justtowatch JUST PICK A TOP TIER personified
[0:14:06] <%gatorafan> @justtowatch enjoy your stay on Zepp
[0:14:08] <+Shishi1205> Jwong is juicing people with him
[0:14:08] <%Asuterisuku> It took me far far too long to figure out that RC was a pun, by the way.
[0:14:11] <%Moonblade92> BTW when will Woolie use his Teleport several times in a row?
[0:14:14] <fairore> @krispen_wa hes top tier ?
[0:14:14] <travelingwolfapples> that's fast
[0:14:14] <leith_aziz> Oooohhh
[0:14:19] <%JustToWatch> Pot is s m
[0:14:19] <$pluckrabbit> Ram is top tier thighs
[0:14:20] <+Solid_Stro> Seeing a fast moving Nago is frightening to me doodWat
[0:14:25] <+the22cstomp> pot is absurdly good right now
[0:14:25] <%Moonblade92> but* now byw
[0:14:30] <SheefEatsBeef> but its cool as fuck
[0:14:39] <%JustToWatch> Pot is so good in the beta
[0:14:41] <%Javaa01> No more 25 tension cancels Xrd cancels
[0:14:43] <biggswedg3> pot may ram
[0:14:43] <stabbityrabbit> So is the consensus on Nago that he's super good situationally, but bad most of the time?
[0:14:46] <leith_aziz> Who's top tier ? I would say: Ky, Sol, Ramlethal
[0:14:48] <+the22cstomp> the new RCs enable him super hard
[0:14:50] <Vaunno> @narfi_steadfast thigh jiggle physics Kreygasm
[0:14:53] <chll0ne> hey i won my first match LUL

[0:15:11] <fairore> @chll0ne good stuff bro
[0:15:18] <+NarcissistCactus> this is footsies
[0:15:18] <+GalacticaPhanto> I felt so bad. I main Pot and ran into a Chipp who was just super optimized and hit him with a Bustah and just melted the poor boy
[0:15:28] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:15:32] <JoshManVGH> Blood Burst is a forced activation?
[0:15:34] <%Asuterisuku> FD stops blood!
[0:15:37] <twoto858> Woah
[0:15:37] <leith_aziz> ooohhhh
[0:15:40] <Vaunno> ooooh
[0:15:44] <chll0ne> @fairore thanks b
[0:15:50] <%Sparkseid> did not know that
[0:15:52] <leith_aziz> Actually thats cool
[0:15:57] <+Solid_Stro> Wow
[0:16:03] <biggswedg3> if you blood rage under someone is it a combo?
[0:16:07] <beatie_g> Tactical mashing PogChamp
[0:16:09] <+Joe2187> is the online up?
[0:16:16] <chll0ne> yes^
[0:16:16] <leith_aziz> Beta is up
[0:16:17] <Darren716> yee
[0:16:24] <+Solid_Stro> So you can bait people to get in close and catch that Blood Rage pop
[0:16:32] <%JustToWatch> Nago is hard to use well, but there's a reason Goichi plays him
[0:16:37] <fairore> @galacticaphanto welp every chip has a plan tell they get grabbed
[0:16:44] <%Moonblade92> oh and the gashadokuro reflected on the blade is cool af
[0:16:58] <ThrillingTremors> @Solid_Stro yeah it pushes them back so you can play neutral after, but if it whiffs youre fucked
[0:17:00] <+Joe2187> Being Black fills the blood guage
[0:17:02] <%MajkirM> MajkirM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Thanks to your hype, I got the Strive beta and been doing decent in online with Giovanna, after not playing fighting games in a long while. I'd like to play some Nago as well when I get more used to it. :D
[0:17:09] <Davontrayt> Nago looks insanely nuts
[0:17:09] <biggswedg3> command grab
[0:17:12] <leith_aziz> The painting reflected on the sword is a nice detail
[0:17:19] <GhostRavens> we talking blood types now?
[0:17:23] <travelingwolfapples> damn
[0:17:24] <Hydrapissed> yep
[0:17:27] <+antpantz> woahaaa

[0:17:45] <leith_aziz> Nago is so tech rich
[0:17:46] <+Solid_Stro> @thrillingtremors I’ll have to keep an eye out for that tact coxBut
[0:17:55] <%Invlux> WE LEARNIN woolieGASM
[0:17:55] <+harsimus> this character is crazy
[0:17:55] <ThrillingTremors> using S and H normals in combos is super legit for maintaining blood
[0:18:04] <Advent_Child04> @woolieversus yo yo yo my brotha!! 🤘🏿
[0:18:04] <Hydrapissed> Chain command bite for max postive lol
[0:18:08] <%Javaa01> I would imagine it caps out at quarter bar plus
[0:18:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:18:12] <leith_aziz> Axl's sauce ?
[0:18:26] <ItsZelus> PogChamp OKAY
[0:18:30] <BlackermanZX> can you super after the wall bounce
[0:18:32] <Applecannon63> Chipp is so bad against Nago
[0:18:34] <leith_aziz> I hope this doesnt get patched
[0:18:35] <+Tai_Gai> AYO
[0:18:36] <Hydrapissed> juggles the whole screen
[0:18:44] <BlackermanZX> yeyeye
[0:18:46] <%JustToWatch> see this is exactly the type of shit my grappler brain can't keep up with
[0:18:47] <%krispen_wa> so how do people figure this shit if they're not in the lab for 5 hours a day?
[0:18:48] <%Moonblade92> damn he remembered 6K esists, that'd have been good against Pat
[0:18:49] <Vaunno> bruuuuh
[0:18:49] <%Javaa01> @Applecannon63 Chipp is kinda raw against everyone right now
[0:19:06] <Hydrapissed> Blood efficient combos
[0:19:07] <ThrillingTremors> nothing adding blood but the dash right?
[0:19:21] <ThrillingTremors> yeah thats good holy shit
[0:19:26] <JetpackMcQuack> We have blood at home
[0:19:28] <Vaunno> the red up down swipes add blood too
[0:19:29] <%gatorafan> @javaa01 God I saw that video of May killing him with one super and I cried a little
[0:19:30] <chll0ne> yoooo
[0:19:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> anyone who picks white ramlethal has poor taste
[0:19:53] <%baka_sugoi> character specific combo?
[0:19:55] <%Javaa01> @gatorafan Nago can do the same thing too with his pop super
[0:19:58] <+OroOreo> @CaptainPileDriver just terrible taste
[0:19:58] <+Shishi1205> God the check the r profile thing is a super trap
[0:20:00] <leith_aziz> Colors dont matter. Choose what you want
[0:20:05] <Vaunno> dont skin shame smh LUL
[0:20:06] <ElPlasa> @ThrillingTremors every special move, so dash, the upswing dp, the long sweep, and the clone if i'm not forgetting anything
[0:20:07] <%Javaa01> So playing Chipp right now is just "don't press anything"
[0:20:10] <$pluckrabbit> @captainpiledriver ey fug u mayne
[0:20:13] <+Sajallday> You can probably do one iteratio of the loop and still be positive
[0:20:13] <leith_aziz> Lets not go there chat
[0:20:15] <+Superbro64> @captainpiledriver there's a whole lot of people with bad taste then doodSteve
[0:20:22] <+IxDomxI> you can actually catch someone with nago's command dash after a 2h counter
[0:20:25] <ThrillingTremors> @ElPlasa i meant in that combo from before with jK and jD
[0:20:31] <+IxDomxI> you dont need rc
[0:20:37] <%krispen_wa> Aww Pat isnt streaming Strive for an actual Saturday Scrublords
[0:20:39] <%Moonblade92> @gatorafan Theres also footage of Ram sword super killing him instant but it's engineered, cranked up RISC, and he's using Gamma Blade which doesn't only make him get counter hit but the Clone takes damage too.
[0:20:48] <ThrillingTremors> @ElPlasa that super low blood gauge combo is so hype
[0:20:54] <ElPlasa> @ThrillingTremors oh right yep
[0:20:56] <biggswedg3> knocks blood off sword*
[0:21:16] <ThrillingTremors> i have such a hard time comboing into 5K after 236K
[0:21:17] <@Menitta> I'm trying really hard to figure out Millia stuff in the air
[0:21:19] <%gatorafan> yeah, the new Gamma Blade is goofy
[0:21:36] <GhostRavens> is this still the beta?
[0:21:36] <$pluckrabbit> hey Menitta where you at what lobby
[0:21:38] <leith_aziz> All I know about Gamma blade is that its plus
[0:21:40] <+NYCrownlessKing> check out #ggst_mi on Twitter @menitta
[0:21:40] <leith_aziz> Thats it
[0:21:41] <freddyl0c0> are we going to see Nago Mirror
[0:21:42] <Ethrion> is that down slash an overhead
[0:21:53] <Applecannon63> Apparently Chipp can soul steal if Dust Attack is interrupted
[0:21:54] <%Moonblade92> oh but the Nago killing him in 2H H super in Bloodrage is legit
[0:21:57] <@Menitta> @NYCrownlessKing Thanks!
[0:22:05] <@Menitta> @narfi_steadfast I'm just labbing rn
[0:22:15] <$pluckrabbit> ok it's rabbit btw
[0:22:32] <$pluckrabbit> need to change my name...
[0:22:33] <@Menitta> I'll prolly hit up USA East. Oh shit whatsup
[0:22:33] <+Solid_Stro> sabert14Sip
[0:22:47] <$pluckrabbit> noice oki
[0:22:48] <Davimotion96> I'v
[0:23:07] <ramzyrizzles> I sooo wanna pick this game up but I can only play PC. Is it really not worth getting it there?
[0:23:10] <Davimotion96> I've seen Nagoriyuki qet a TOD on Potemkin
[0:23:24] <+chiazam> What causes someone to wall splat vs not
[0:23:25] <%tyler274> tyler274 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Aria stans hold out hope for our gal (guy?)
[0:23:27] <travelingwolfapples> what go back
[0:23:35] <leith_aziz> I wouldnt mind Aria
[0:23:36] <+NYCrownlessKing> if u do pc ur fine but ur just gonna play with a smaller base of players @ramzyrizzles
[0:23:43] <biggswedg3> the cracks get bigger
[0:23:43] <+Shishi1205> I fought a millia that did that
[0:23:43] <+Hard_Crash> Full wall break combo from K, 5K, Dp dash cancel, close S, S combo cancel, DP, K
[0:23:46] <leith_aziz> But make her not like Jack-O
[0:23:48] <+NYCrownlessKing> and gotta wait till they hopefully add it to crossplay
[0:23:48] <chll0ne> @chiazam slash or heavy slash im sure
[0:23:49] <+Hollow_Mirage> To be honest I see people complain about the UI with the numbers getting big, I can understand that but that makes my monkey brain shoot neurons.
[0:23:56] <+Shishi1205> She splatted into super
[0:23:56] <Applecannon63> I mean there could be me a more specific crack in the wall
[0:23:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's the zato-1 combos
[0:24:02] <GhostRavens> @Hollow_Mirage oh same
[0:24:03] <stabbityrabbit> @Davimotion96 That had 100% risc though. Most of the crazy set-ups I've seen are super situational.
[0:24:21] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> What if woolie wasn’t vs.
[0:24:25] <leith_aziz> Im still going for PC. PS4 is not my best setup
[0:24:25] <Davimotion96> I see, I got baited
[0:24:28] <Applecannon63> UI combo counter getting bigger is honestly hype
[0:24:31] <FacetiousAF> we bein GAMERS?!
[0:24:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone just ragequit on me
[0:24:33] <Hydrapissed> short port techs
[0:24:35] <Hydrapissed> thats pretty smart
[0:24:40] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> What if woolie was unity?
[0:24:44] <leith_aziz> I hate the combo counter getting bigger
[0:24:45] <ItsZelus> halt momentum
[0:24:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> first time I got a ragequitter in this game
[0:24:49] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> UNION WOOLIE
[0:24:49] <Hydrapissed> thats a foostie lord game there
[0:24:51] <Vaunno> literally a wavedash
[0:24:52] <Karwakamu> can you FD break the slide?
[0:24:52] <biggswedg3> nago seems super popular
[0:24:53] <leith_aziz> It covers the creen too much
[0:24:55] <+Tai_Gai> Nago wavedashes noice
[0:25:00] <+Hollow_Mirage> My PC has a RTX 2060 better display and ethernet connection compared to my PS4 soooooo yeah PC
[0:25:07] <ThrillingTremors> @Applecannon63 i think its a design decision to make counterhit confirms more accesssible. i honestly appreciate it because im a potato
[0:25:21] <+Shishi1205> @CaptainPileDriver I've seen 0 ragequits
[0:25:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:25:47] <leith_aziz> My screen doesnt have audio outside of headset and i cant adjust sound on PS45

[0:26:03] <+mechslayer71> Wool is dragging another down to his suffering I see Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:26:03] <leith_aziz> So PC it is
[0:26:05] <%Moonblade92> is 6P upper body invincible? Hater friend who has a console tells me. 6P doesn't AA well anymore/doesn't have upper body inv
[0:26:13] <smiggyballs13> Anybody else you maining in strive, Woolz?
[0:26:16] <Vaunno> ps45? mans livin in 4041
[0:26:21] <leith_aziz> 6P is upper bodi invincible
[0:26:32] <leith_aziz> But airblocking is pretty easy
[0:26:32] <Vaunno> pretty much always
[0:26:35] <GhostRavens> @Vaun0x hey, do they at least have it in stock?
[0:26:35] <ThrillingTremors> @Vaun0x atpRtsd
[0:26:46] <Vaunno> KEKW
[0:26:47] <%yves_is_online> @moonblade92 i think? i play faust and my 6p is pretty reliable in this game
[0:27:10] <Hydrapissed> hmmmmmmmm
[0:27:12] <%wibbwobbler> this is so sick
[0:27:22] <biggswedg3> chickenblock is real strong in this game
[0:27:22] <%JustToWatch> that would make sense
[0:27:23] <Hydrapissed> that would make sense
[0:27:26] <Vaunno> @ghostravens theyve limited sales to 8 per day to keep up with demand Kappa
[0:27:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Hey guys lytHI been playing GG all day.
[0:27:34] <Karwakamu> @Moonblade92 AA is generally not as good in ST
[0:27:39] <+Shishi1205> Just perfected a Nago as potemkim lmao, this is so fun
[0:27:40] <+Maplekon> maybe counter hit is effecting it
[0:27:46] <DaKnightWarrior> so good but i hate the lobby.
[0:27:49] <Memitim> @woolieversus you can also RC in the air during dust and it'll reset the gravity
[0:28:18] <chll0ne> yup^
[0:28:24] <%slayabee> I've done K D S HS I think and that does good damage
[0:28:24] <stabbityrabbit> Combo number getting bigger with every hit wouldn't be so bad if they the hit number didn't start large as fuck.
[0:28:25] <chll0ne> im doin it w nago now
[0:28:33] <Hydrapissed> looks cool doe
[0:28:37] <Vashido22> Sol get stupid damage with Dust RC
[0:28:47] <Applecannon63> Chipp can soul steal someone who RC'd during Dust
[0:28:47] <andre11dr> It just might be the hitbox
[0:28:48] <biggswedg3> weight classes
[0:29:16] <Applecannon63> wait I mean burst
[0:29:22] <Applecannon63> during dust
[0:29:25] <+Hollow_Mirage> Yeah I agree rabbit I feel like if the number was smaller and it stuck to the side of the screen which the character aren’t it looks really good but when the characters are on top of it, it gets weird
[0:29:28] <GhostRavens> so who's the best beginner character so far? i imagine sol or ky?
[0:29:31] <leith_aziz> This was very annoying in +R
[0:29:37] <leith_aziz> Its not as bad now
[0:29:43] <Applecannon63> Gio for her safe
[0:29:44] <BoxNavy> :O
[0:29:50] <BlackermanZX> that was pretty good
[0:29:51] <andre11dr> The way GG works is that you always have to adjust your combo depending on the caracter
[0:29:54] <%Son_Bruce> Son_Bruce subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! been following you and the best friends crew since the early days of two best friends. I'm in a better place because of you guys and now I can at least support with twitch primes. thanks for the all the best content wools
[0:29:54] <chll0ne> sexism!!
[0:30:05] <leith_aziz> Sol, Ky, Leo, May and Faust are the best beginner characters
[0:30:10] <ItsZelus> sexist combos smh
[0:30:10] <+kirk0625> ooooh wow
[0:30:15] <+kirk0625> suuup
[0:30:17] <+EtherwXlf> Man I was sitting screaming "What is D? WHAT IS D!?" then I remembered that Dust exists
[0:30:18] <Applecannon63> Gio is considered beginner
[0:30:20] <metabot64> i think gravity was the only variable in +R and iirc only pot and order sol had different gravities?
[0:30:26] <leith_aziz> Giovanna too
[0:30:26] <smiggyballs13> Unreliable
[0:30:27] <+thecowpow> I can't play fighting games even FighterZ is too much for my brain and fingers but damn I LOVE watching people play them so hype even just this practice stuff
[0:30:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Gio is alot of fun.
[0:30:36] <%Asuterisuku> Big asterisk on Leo; he can be PLAYED by newbies, but can he be played WELL?
[0:30:38] <+Tai_Gai> This is the most accessible GG has ever been and i love it
[0:30:52] <biggswedg3> all the chars are pretty easy to learn
[0:30:54] <leith_aziz> Yes, mashing with Leo is still GOOD
[0:30:54] <+Shishi1205> Potemkins dust has 2 hits only lmao
[0:31:00] <ThrillingTremors> @Tai_Gai dude im right there with so its so hype
[0:31:05] <+Shishi1205> You always land it if they dont burst
[0:31:07] <OldManDeckardCain> leo is a beginner character as long as the opponent doesn't know you can throw his crossup LUL
[0:31:08] <ThrillingTremors> *with you
[0:31:20] <biggswedg3> even zato is a lot easier to get
[0:31:23] <+Sajallday> @woolieversus did you see if you 214HS purple RC, Nago gets a long jump
[0:31:25] <andre11dr> Sol is pretty reliable for me ,but i guess that could be past game experience kicking in
[0:31:26] <mirtosss> delay the first jd
[0:31:33] <%Strahlenwaffeln> are you ju,p canmceling forward?
[0:31:33] <Applecannon63> Gio is fun and insane that she do infinites
[0:31:34] <smiggyballs13> @thrillingtremors Why you gotta do him like dat
[0:31:36] <ThrillingTremors> @Sajallday he showed us earlier its sick
[0:31:37] <GhostRavens> @biggswedg3 well that's a sentence i never expected to read
[0:31:39] <leith_aziz> He has lows, overheads, left/right mixups, a counter AND a command grab
[0:31:40] <+Ultimate_Edge> @OldManDeckardCain *if you can throw his crossup on reaction. I lack those :(
[0:31:41] <+Tai_Gai> @OldManDeckardCain it gives me so much pain
[0:31:42] <%Strahlenwaffeln> thzat often helps to linkl stuff
[0:31:46] <+Sajallday> sweet
[0:31:52] <+chiazam> Are they both using Sticks?
[0:32:08] <andre11dr> Yea, wild throw is pretty good in this game
[0:32:08] <mirtosss> You can extend the bite range if you dash before it
[0:32:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm as ready as I'm gonna be
[0:32:14] <MKII> counter hit city
[0:32:16] <stabbityrabbit> @Hollow_Mirage This UI in general has in issue with getting in the way of the action. As much as people complain about this UI being too minimalistic, there's tons of wasted space on screen. Like I really want the UI to be MORE minimal.
[0:32:20] <smiggyballs13> @chiazam Looks like cons
[0:32:21] <biggswedg3> because of the gattling changes a lot of routes are linear
[0:32:27] <%Asuterisuku> That tick throw

[0:32:35] <+Shishi1205> Oh man just got to towe level 8, some killers waiting here
[0:32:47] <armchairmaster_> Oh SHIT
[0:32:47] <leith_aziz> @stabbityrabbit: I agree. Less is more
[0:32:49] <HopeThisOneIsntTaken> Can't they counter grab that if they see it coming
[0:32:53] <Memitim> Nago's getup animation still amuses me
[0:32:56] <Hydrapissed> pat was getting grabbed by that like crazy
[0:32:59] <leith_aziz> But i DO like the big COUNTER screen
[0:33:00] <%Strahlenwaffeln> floor 8 threw me right back out^^
[0:33:04] <leith_aziz> Its hype
[0:33:05] <+ar4ndomblackguy> shmix in your shmovement
[0:33:11] <+Ultimate_Edge> So does nobody play on the heaven floor? It's empty for me
[0:33:27] <biggswedg3> @Ultimate_Edge everyones in parks to hold rank
[0:33:27] <andre11dr> I will say, still not a fan of the new grant viper, od rather for him to just have the AC version
[0:33:32] <OldManDeckardCain> I love how woolie killed himself in that match more than pat LUL
[0:33:48] <leith_aziz> I got in the celestial floor twice. But one time there were only two there. And the second time it was just me there
[0:34:00] <+Ultimate_Edge> @biggswedg3 Now that's just lame :(
[0:34:07] <leith_aziz> I like new grand viper
[0:34:18] <Applecannon63> maybe think the combo counter could shrink a little during a 50 hits
[0:34:24] <leith_aziz> Mashing left and right for distance was not fun
[0:34:35] <leith_aziz> Holding S is more streamlined
[0:34:47] <GhostRavens> uh, fuzzy?
[0:34:48] <%Moonblade92> I'm surprised not one of the two is commenting on how sick Nago's theme is
[0:34:48] <%Asuterisuku> Big agree on that.
[0:34:53] <+zetaplus> sol has a infinite with grand viper which is pretty neat
[0:34:55] <%Noonoox12> fuzzy definition, pls?
[0:35:00] <BoxNavy> fuzzy :)
[0:35:03] <stabbityrabbit> @leith_aziz Same. Counter and Dust being crazy feels hype. The top three inches of the screen being taken up by health bars does not.
[0:35:14] <Hydrapissed> oh no abara
[0:35:18] <chll0ne> @biggswedg3 except for zato
[0:35:24] <andre11dr> Ive definitely been fuzzyd by Milia
[0:35:24] <%gatorafan> NotLikeThis
[0:35:27] <smiggyballs13> Region specific
[0:35:32] <Darren716> I thought I knew what I was doing when I was playing earlier, turns out I know nothing
[0:35:35] <%Noonoox12> Guess or Pain
[0:35:38] <%Javaa01> Difficult-to-blockable
[0:35:43] <chll0ne> leo is definitely a noob purifier
[0:35:46] <%wibbwobbler> open em up
[0:35:48] <GhostRavens> gotcha
[0:35:56] <leith_aziz> @stabbityrabbit: I agree if I understand you correctly
[0:36:15] <%Asuterisuku> I always heard the JP definition.
[0:36:24] <leith_aziz> So fuzzy is mixing between both possibilities
[0:36:24] <Memitim> I thought fuzzy guarding was like, when a character has a really fast low but slow overhead, so you always block low and try to react to the overhead, but vise versa
[0:36:27] <%Asuterisuku> ... Probably because that's how UNI's tutorial defines it.
[0:36:34] <leith_aziz> To avoid getting opened
[0:36:37] <Memitim> *or not but
[0:36:56] <+BirdoFan> Any of ya know if Nago's command dash can be bdc'ed into stuff?
[0:36:57] <+Ultimate_Edge> Jumping in general in this game is strong. Anti airs get kind of nothing and jump ins can win matches.
[0:36:59] <+harsimus> You can block without meter I thought?
[0:37:10] <Nekros4442> oh Woolie
[0:37:10] <GhostRavens> ! FINGERS AT RISK !
[0:37:10] <stevo_scar> have you seen the low long jump with RC
[0:37:11] <DrBeanie> do you get much off of anti air 6p?
[0:37:11] <%Moonblade92> @andre11dr Honestly getting "Fuzzied" by Milia was always a bit of a joke to me because her K overhead is like... Just don't get hit by Milia at all.
[0:37:12] <%jaggstar2020> doodLUL
[0:37:13] <Hydrapissed> hands getting CHAFFED
[0:37:13] <%baka_sugoi> 5P best AA

[0:37:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> suffering for succ
[0:37:19] <%Noonoox12> Pick up the fight stick?
[0:37:20] <BoxNavy> gg broke his fingers?
[0:37:21] <+Sajallday> gotta play on stick woolie
[0:37:24] <andre11dr> Now that i have a better grasp of this game, man Venom would be pretty dominant
[0:37:26] <smiggyballs13> Battle damage
[0:37:28] <%Noonoox12> hitbox time?
[0:37:29] <%Asuterisuku> Nice colour though.
[0:37:30] <velgaduere> just get new hands 4Head
[0:37:36] <leith_aziz> I feel like jumping has know real solution if you wanna deal with it
[0:37:38] <Nekros4442> I thought Reggie would go straight to Ramlethal
[0:37:38] <Applecannon63> NAGO MIRROR
[0:37:39] <GhostRavens> He's SO Cool
[0:37:41] <leith_aziz> I LOVE Nago
[0:37:43] <%baka_sugoi> DP is slow not that reliable
[0:37:44] <+Sajallday> I had the same issue with dbfz, I could barely pick up a pencil some days
[0:37:45] <andre11dr> He's really cool
[0:37:50] <biggswedg3> he is cool
[0:37:55] <Ethrion> GIOVANNA THEME
[0:37:56] <lonosi55> Is woolie being sarcastic? he didnt think reggie would pick nago?? Lol. LMAO.
[0:37:57] <leith_aziz> Easily my favorite newcomer
[0:37:59] <%kewlmyc> Is Woolie playing on stick or pad for this game?
[0:38:03] <GhostRavens> it's the vampirism gimmick that sold him to me tbh
[0:38:05] <+Sajallday> pad
[0:38:08] <+Shishi1205> Zato is for big brains
[0:38:14] <%gatorafan> Mankind kn-
[0:38:14] <Applecannon63> I really hope Nago gets some form of Pilebunker
[0:38:20] <%Asuterisuku> But they saw beauty in the lives of beasts and couldn't lie to themselves about it.
[0:38:20] <BlackermanZX> oh wow chip can fly to space with faultless defense shenanigans
[0:38:21] <biggswedg3> I love gio v gio intro
[0:38:21] <leith_aziz> The music is cool

[0:42:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> WOOOOW
[0:42:15] <GhostRavens> how DARE you press buttons in a button basher?
[0:42:17] <@Menitta> I really like the new throws
[0:42:18] <+Tai_Gai> HMMM
[0:42:18] <%Kaito_Cam> Probably not during the beta
[0:42:19] <Aydarkzero> that's cause it's local Kappa
[0:42:21] <Ethrion> can you die from blood rage drain?
[0:42:21] <%SUTTONSOMEGA> CorgiDerp
[0:42:21] <Solidnick18> Jebaited ?
[0:42:23] <Ecliptic_Origins> that's so weird
[0:42:23] <AstrodropGaming> DONT PRESS BUTTONS
[0:42:26] <leith_aziz> I think rematch is a thing now
[0:42:27] <blackkanye> Does online beta test mean nothing to you?
[0:42:29] <+Ultimate_Edge> They really want to make you look at their lobbies :)
[0:42:29] <@Menitta> I vastly prefer whiffing a throw than just heavy slash
[0:42:33] <leith_aziz> It got removed for beta
[0:42:34] <%johnny_gogo> SO MANY FIGHTING GAMES ARE LIKE THAT AND I HATE IT
[0:42:37] <stabbityrabbit> @Ethrion No.
[0:42:38] <%Akizea> they took it out on purpose for the beta
[0:42:39] <Hydrapissed> wow the oki there by reggie on the wall lol
[0:42:39] <%Javaa01> @Ethrion No, you get set to 1hp, but you can get chipped out in this game
[0:42:39] <Vadrigar1994> Probably no rematch option so people can play a lot of other people for the beta
[0:42:43] <BlackermanZX> probably they removed it for online testing stuff
[0:42:46] <Ethrion> oooo
[0:42:51] <%Kaito_Cam> what @Vadrigar1994 said
[0:42:54] <velgaduere> makes sense, they want as many people to fight each other as possible online. they don't care about you fighting friends or running sets lobosKek
[0:42:56] <%Asuterisuku> @fatcrab Of course I'd still prefer two button style, but at least there's more intentionality now.
[0:42:58] <andre11dr> That good old Cali burst
[0:42:59] <+BirdoFan> @Vadrigar1994 thats a good point
[0:43:03] <biggswedg3> it really makes the lobbies a lot worse to play tho
[0:43:05] <Vaunno> lesgoo
[0:43:12] <FacetiousAF> SourPls
[0:43:17] <leith_aziz> STILL MY HEART IS BLAZING

[0:43:25] <biggswedg3> this is the only song I play
[0:43:29] <+saltsuzu> now the question is will woolie drop this guy as soon as baiken comes out
[0:43:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @leith_aziz
[0:43:36] <Triplicat> probably not
[0:43:37] <velgaduere> if rematch isn't in lobbies in the full release I'll be shocked
[0:43:52] <biggswedg3> elphelt is the 15
[0:43:52] <Hydrapissed> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[0:43:55] <%jaggstar2020> doodOK
[0:43:55] <%X2Eliah> This is getting really onesided
[0:43:56] <%gatorafan> In full release we'll just be able to pretend those lobbies don't exist
[0:43:58] <Applecannon63> deleted
[0:43:59] <%Asuterisuku> You're trapped in the dark cell created by this world
[0:44:01] <+chiazam> NERDSS
[0:44:05] <+Deko_> its impossible to not sing along
[0:44:17] <andre11dr> I always thought Baiken looked cool, but i hate her gameplay, she's so boring
[0:44:20] <%Moonblade92> I wonder if Woolie will try Anji at all. I know Pat think Anji is basically a secret character lmao
[0:44:21] <%Kaito_Cam> Those lyrics have been living in my head rent free
[0:44:23] <ThrillingTremors> damn woolie
[0:44:30] <leith_aziz> Guys, when you give feedback at the end os beta, mention the stuff about the rematch and lobby, even if its obvious
[0:44:40] <%thedankestmeeme> not every1 can be GO1 reggie can't see every openinig just swing!
[0:44:41] <leith_aziz> This is importnat
[0:44:43] <%gatorafan> Taking RISCs
[0:45:01] <%Kaito_Cam> I thought slayer was the last vampire
[0:45:12] <juxtest> Well hes not
[0:45:14] <%Asuterisuku> Nago has to have had a sire somewhere.
[0:45:15] <andre11dr> Apparently not
[0:45:15] <Applecannon63> Man its interesting how Nago got redesigned a bit
[0:45:19] <leith_aziz> There are other vampires that exist
[0:45:20] <Aydarkzero> surprise new Vampire
[0:45:26] <%Moonblade92> I wonder if only way to make the spin slash is to cancel it into teleport.
[0:45:27] <leith_aziz> But not many I think
[0:45:31] <+BirdoFan> 15 is just Sol in permanent DI
[0:45:37] <+Shishi1205> Ram vs potemkim is not fun, I do not like those double hitting swords
[0:45:40] <the_super_suit> reggie getting shmixed
[0:45:48] <juxtest> 15 is Robo-Sin
[0:45:52] <MayorRev> oh shit i didnt hear smell of the game was on
[0:45:56] <%Kaito_Cam> I wonder when the 3rd lore video comes out.
[0:45:58] <DetroitSentai> 15 is Asuka unless they make him some secret unlockable/free postlaunch dlc
[0:45:59] <leith_aziz> SLAMMED
[0:46:00] <biggswedg3> when you hear BULLSHIT BLAZING SourPls
[0:46:04] <KaijuCarl> 15 is daisuke
[0:46:04] <%WutangchickeN> Yoooooooo what's good homies?
[0:46:04] <+CaptainPyron> Still love how the vampires in ArcSys stuff are basically all OP.
[0:46:06] <freddyl0c0> you guys have to p into fwd p into dp
[0:46:09] <+Ultimate_Edge> @BirdoFan That is the only proper apology for not giving him DI regularly
[0:46:10] <Jaysky> Anyone else get to witness the Woolz v Pat fights last night?
[0:46:15] <%thedankestmeeme> are we gonna see any Gio? or Faust? maybe a leo?
[0:46:16] <andre11dr> But not as fast
[0:46:19] <%featuringfen> featuringfen subscribed with Prime.
[0:46:19] <Applecannon63> pose
[0:46:26] <biggswedg3> 15 has to be like sin or elphelt
[0:46:28] <+CaptainPyron> Yeah, those were fun to watch.
[0:46:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:29] <+Deko_> sick
[0:46:33] <@Menitta> I feel like my fingers are not fast enough for big Guilty Gear combos
[0:46:34] <leith_aziz> We can try first to 5 and see if its better
[0:46:35] <Dave_VD> @Jaysky Nah where did they stream it?
[0:46:36] <biggswedg3> how you have ram lethal and not her siblings
[0:46:37] <%Seancicle> 👋🏻🤌🏻?
[0:46:39] <%Asuterisuku> Slayer and Raechel are certainly the poster characters for that.
[0:46:39] <+BirdoFan> @Ultimate_Edge lmao
[0:46:39] <+CaptainPyron> Pat's Pot seems pretty solid.
[0:46:40] <KaijuCarl> when's venom?
[0:46:41] <+SuperUnhappyman> Fuck yeah I love samsho
[0:46:41] <Applecannon63> 15 is Asuka
[0:46:41] <andre11dr> And doesn't really get a vortex like Slayer
[0:46:41] <@Menitta> Either fast or precise
[0:46:51] <smiggyballs13> Those intros remind me of soul calibur
[0:46:52] <+Tai_Gai> COUNTER
[0:46:53] <%Kaito_Cam> Finally saw what is blood gauge does.
[0:46:54] <leith_aziz> You do NOT want Elphelt
[0:46:55] <%Moonblade92> Is the final strike of that S string cancelable? I never see woolie follow it up
[0:47:01] <leith_aziz> Trust me from Xrd
[0:47:06] <%Akizea> highkey I just want a new character for character 15
[0:47:09] <%Kaito_Cam> I thought the blood sparks were bad
[0:47:12] <biggswedg3> I dont want elphelt but where is she? her sister is here
[0:47:16] <Jaysky> @Dave_VD Pat's stream. It was impromptu and they had some really good matches. Not sure if Pat keeps VODS so you may need to wait on him uploading to youtube
[0:47:18] <%Asuterisuku> Hype for this game has been making me touch Xrd.
[0:47:18] <@Menitta> I'd hope for a new character
[0:47:21] <+CaptainPyron> Well they changed a bunch of characters already. Strive Elphelt could be totally different now.
[0:47:22] <%Kaito_Cam> So spamming specials bad
[0:47:22] <+BirdoFan> I'd be cool with 15 being Sharon, too
[0:47:23] <TopLeftCenter> @Moonblade92 no, it knocks down
[0:47:30] <+Deko_> damn woolie
[0:47:31] <%Akizea> 15 being ariels would be cool
[0:47:32] <BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[0:47:33] <leith_aziz> Elphelt is probably doing fine
[0:47:33] <%thedankestmeeme> @WoolieVersus whats your opinion on ram? she looks like someone I'd like to play but idk if he's F tier
[0:47:38] <BackflipCharm> I just want Johnny back
[0:47:42] <stabbityrabbit> All these people saying the last character is That Man forgetting that ArcSys already set up a female final boss in XRD.
[0:47:44] <+Ultimate_Edge> Actually I selfishly want them to apologize for the choppy beta by adding Anji :) PLZ
[0:47:47] <%Akizea> That man would be sick as FUCK
[0:47:51] <@Menitta> I want Johnny
[0:47:52] <%Moonblade92> Ram is the glorious overgod of Strive lol
[0:47:55] <+CaptainPyron> Ram's pretty solid if SonicFox was playing her. I'm sure.
[0:47:57] <the_super_suit> you guys think we're gonna get baiken in this?
[0:47:59] <%Kaito_Cam> @thedankestmeeme doesn't SonicFox playher?
[0:48:01] <GhostRavens> i want slayer back tbh
[0:48:05] <EuGeniius> @woolieversus best blanka in the world
[0:48:05] <biggswedg3> ram is top tier
[0:48:06] <%Asuterisuku> Nago has the Slayer KD pose!
[0:48:07] <andre11dr> Im honestly kinda shocked Sin is not in the launch roster, you'd think he'd be more important than Leo but i guess not
[0:48:10] <%thedankestmeeme> due but doesnt he play every waifu
[0:48:10] <leith_aziz> I mean I just think Ariels as the last character would be lame
[0:48:11] <+Tai_Gai> You just gotta manage your swords
[0:48:12] <%wibbwobbler> coool
[0:48:14] <Applecannon63> 15 being That man but play style is like Justice or another Justice-like Gear
[0:48:20] <Jaysky> You know one of the reasons why SonicFox is playing Ram. The same reason others are.
[0:48:25] <sunnythedrunk> @the_super_suit She's def gonna be DLC, the degens will pay up
[0:48:26] <+CaptainPyron> It's funny how many people are playing Ram, Gio, or Nago though.
[0:48:27] <leith_aziz> She can be DLC
[0:48:28] <%thedankestmeeme> IM NOT A REGGIE
[0:48:31] <%thedankestmeeme> I DONT LIKE FEET
[0:48:37] <EuGeniius> @jaysky what do you know knwS
[0:48:40] <BlackermanZX> Sol's wife Aria is probably gonna be playable at some point
[0:48:42] <biggswedg3> pot may and ram are like objectively the best rn
[0:48:42] <leith_aziz> Ram is not for you then
[0:48:44] <%Moonblade92> @thedankestmeeme Just to repeat, almost everyone puts Ram in a tier of her own. She's THAT good. Unga as all hell.
[0:48:46] <%Kaito_Cam> Thigh Jiggle?
[0:48:50] <fatcrab> by the way everyone accent core plus R is $3 on steam!! if you wanna play something after the beta is over it has great rollback just like this
[0:48:52] <sunnythedrunk> Well Gio and Nago are the new hotness
[0:48:53] <+Sp3ctre48> Idk what she'd do but Aria being the last character would be really cool to me
[0:48:53] <@Menitta> Overall, I'm not a huge fan of the roster in Strive. I like Millia but it doesnt have a lot of the other characters I like to play in GG
[0:48:55] <+kirk0625> the thigh jiggle is good
[0:48:57] <biggswedg3> everyone is trying to make nago broken too
[0:48:59] <Jaysky> @EuGeniius I know far too much forbidden knowledge
[0:49:05] <%thedankestmeeme> @leith_aziz sadge
[0:49:09] <ItsKrisGBeanie> Someone say thigh jiggle HahaSweat
[0:49:10] <%jaggstar2020> In for the kill
[0:49:15] <leith_aziz> Aria could be cool
[0:49:20] <sunnythedrunk> @Menitta Who you play in XRD
[0:49:21] <EuGeniius> @jaysky Kappa
[0:49:25] <+CaptainPyron> Ram's fun, but I'm definitely waiting for DLC for my true main.
[0:49:29] <%Kaito_Cam> @ItsKrisGBeanie apparently her thighs jiggle when she does certain attacks
[0:49:33] <+Tai_Gai> PogChamp mfw thigh juggle
[0:49:34] <+Hollow_Mirage> I was doing school work and lurking someone say Thigh Jiggle?
[0:49:38] <%thedankestmeeme> @Moonblade92 thats what i like to hear thou VoHiYo
[0:49:39] <travelingwolfapples> be afraid wooile
[0:49:41] <andre11dr> Nago is cool and all ,but i REALLY want ma dandy back
[0:49:42] <+Tai_Gai> jiggle*
[0:49:46] <Applecannon63> Aria as another Justice or Dizzy would be interesting
[0:49:46] <BlackermanZX> Did someone say ram's thigh jiggle doodDrool
[0:49:53] <leith_aziz> We all have our preferences, but I got Leo, Nago and Ramlethal
[0:49:53] <KaijuCarl> goku is 15 lol
[0:49:54] <+drjazzmonkay> can confirm its 6HS
[0:49:55] <+BirdoFan> I forgot who here said Robo-Sin but I'd pick him up if he's 15 too lol
[0:50:00] <ItsKrisGBeanie> @kaito_cam it’s killed me GlitchNRG no regrets
[0:50:02] <leith_aziz> So I aint complaining
[0:50:02] <+Shishi1205> Check the subreddit for that jiggle
[0:50:05] <@Menitta> @sunnythedrunk I played Jam, Johnny and Millia
[0:50:05] <Jaysky> You'd think Ram's thighs would be firm as hell with no jiggle
[0:50:09] <+CaptainPyron> Leo, Ram, and Gio for me so far.
[0:50:10] <the_super_suit> you think they're gonna add a guest character since most fite games do that now?
[0:50:13] <+Deko_> timed with the song lol
[0:50:23] <+Shadowanroid> redmufLaughing
[0:50:27] <@Menitta> and Ky
[0:50:31] <leith_aziz> Guest character I think is the smartest choice to make
[0:50:32] <+CaptainPyron> Maybe they'll get silly and put a BlazBlue character in. lol
[0:50:34] <%gatorafan> Ram's diet is just Hemborger
[0:50:37] <+BirdoFan> @the_super_suit honestly could see it
[0:50:38] <Dave_VD> Reggie is learning fast
[0:50:41] <+Hollow_Mirage> Ram went from eating the souls of the innocent to “Borgor”
[0:50:43] <+kirk0625> Leo for me. I want to like Chipp but he needs more life!
[0:50:46] <leith_aziz> You want to attract the general audience
[0:50:52] <biggswedg3> I dont think theyd do a guess this early
[0:50:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> pick zato-1
[0:50:57] <sunnythedrunk> @Menitta Yeah it's unfortunate but most of those character styles have changed. Giovanna is decently close to Jam, but I totally get it
[0:50:59] <%Asuterisuku> Onigiri enthusiast Nago
[0:51:01] <+Tai_Gai> Leo my gorilla man
[0:51:05] <+Dorf1> i could see a blazblue or under night character being added
[0:51:05] <leith_aziz> I like how Ram developed between games
[0:51:07] <+CaptainPyron> It'll definitely be like a Season 2 thing if anything.
[0:51:09] <@Menitta> Yeah I do like Giovanna a lot
[0:51:10] <Jaysky> @leith_aziz So Shovel Knight?
[0:51:12] <BoxNavy> woolie ky woolie ky
[0:51:18] <%gatorafan> Ado's intro is so cool
[0:51:20] <the_super_suit> i want Nero as a dlc guest character
[0:51:21] <leith_aziz> For GG ? I'd say Dante
[0:51:24] <andre11dr> I think I'll just stick with Sol and probably Nago until i get Slayer or I-No back
[0:51:24] <Applecannon63> how cool if they made Order Sol but in DI form as the 15 fighter or DLC?
[0:51:27] <%gatorafan> *Axl
[0:51:27] <leith_aziz> Goku if possible
[0:51:28] <@Menitta> Ky changed a ton and it fucks me up
[0:51:28] <Ethrion> someone call octopimp
[0:51:31] <Solidnick18> axl is really weird
[0:51:42] <+Tai_Gai> Dominican Ky
[0:51:43] <sunnythedrunk> Ky is so different it's crazy
[0:51:43] <ItsKrisGBeanie> We all know where rams hat fluff went to TehePelo
[0:51:43] <biggswedg3> it has to be sin or elphelt or a new character
[0:51:47] <%baka_sugoi> Stun Edge
[0:51:50] <MKII> ice car Kappa
[0:51:51] <+BirdoFan> Cant wait for Terry in GG /s
[0:51:53] <the_super_suit> dante is too complicated for fighting games
[0:51:53] <%wibbwobbler> VoteYea
[0:51:54] <%JustToWatch> if this game does as well is it seems like it will, I think were in for a lot of DLC characters
[0:51:55] <Applecannon63> FOUDE ARC
[0:51:55] <biggswedg3> wheres everyones kids at
[0:51:59] <+Solid_Stro> Woolie is in the zone
[0:51:59] <%Asuterisuku> Sol's stage and theme seeing a workout.
[0:52:00] <the_super_suit> i think nero is a perfect balance
[0:52:02] <leith_aziz> Dante is in MVC
[0:52:03] <Paciboyy> i haven't managed to play an axl or zato yet
[0:52:04] <biggswedg3> why ram
[0:52:05] <Applecannon63> also known as FOOD ARC
[0:52:06] <leith_aziz> He's not new
[0:52:15] <metaphase72> Ky doesn’t have any air combos except when in the corner
[0:52:17] <Jaysky> @biggswedg3 Why not Ram?
[0:52:20] <%gatorafan> Brazilian Ky, with electric powers and everything
[0:52:20] <NotHereToStream> i keep night vortexing under ky's projectile, its stupid funny
[0:52:24] <Triplicat> RIP greed sever 2002-2021
[0:52:27] <biggswedg3> shes so alone
[0:52:27] <DeadlyJoker29> Guilty Gear Lore made me like Ky better actually. His backstory is great
[0:52:30] <+Solid_Stro> I’ve yet to fight an Axl and I’m dreading the day
[0:52:33] <@Menitta> I liked XXR Ky the most
[0:52:38] <Applecannon63> Food Arc is new Greed Sever
[0:52:41] <leith_aziz> FOOD ARC is the new Greed Sever
[0:52:42] <%Rehse> Rehse subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:52:49] <Memitim> s t u n s t a t e
[0:52:54] <leith_aziz> Great minds think alike
[0:52:56] <Triplicat> shock state
[0:52:59] <Jaysky> Every time there's a lobby without Ram someone should be asking, "Where's Ram?"
[0:52:59] <andre11dr> Ky is the most boring, GG has to offer gameplay wise
[0:53:00] <metabot64> FOOD arc? it looks like order sols bandit revolver?
[0:53:09] <leith_aziz> S H O C K S T A T E
[0:53:09] <%gatorafan> woolieSHOOK STATE
[0:53:14] <the_super_suit> still can't believe Sol's real name is fuckin Frederick
[0:53:22] <%JustToWatch> there needs to be a super basic character though
[0:53:24] <+Dorf1> what does shock state do?
[0:53:24] <BoxNavy> ky is so hot dude
[0:53:25] <Paciboyy> He looks like a frederick
[0:53:27] <+Hollow_Mirage> Freddie Mercury
[0:53:28] <+BirdoFan> Fred Badguy
[0:53:29] <Cjsquid> anyone got any tips for chipp?
[0:53:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:53:33] <BlackermanZX> Sal Goodman
[0:53:36] <+CaptainPyron> As much as I'd like more Xrd characters I played, I hope most of the DLC is new or like more classic peeps.
[0:53:37] <+OroOreo> sol wifeguy
[0:53:39] <%gatorafan> Frederick Badguy Kappa
[0:53:39] <%JaseAdrift> @JustToWatch there is one her name is Giovanna
[0:53:40] <metabot64> @the_super_suit hes supposed to be a queen reference
[0:53:41] <Applecannon63> I thinks that the point that Ky based some moves from Sol
[0:53:46] <leith_aziz> Ragequit
[0:53:48] <andre11dr> @the_super_suit Yeah, it's a Queen reference
[0:53:54] <the_super_suit> that's lame
[0:53:54] <beatie_g> man
[0:54:03] <+chiazam> Use it
[0:54:03] <the_super_suit> sol badguy has a lame name
[0:54:04] <@Menitta> Queen is great
[0:54:04] <metabot64> i mean the guys favorite album is sheer heart attack
[0:54:19] <%Asuterisuku> Loading seems pretty fast, is this the PS5 version?

[0:56:20] <BoxNavy> i think woolie is just hyperfocused on the game
[0:56:23] <+drjazzmonkay> nah he just mad focused lol
[0:56:24] <KaijuCarl> woolie is concentrating lol
[0:56:27] <andre11dr> I always found wierd that Queen was Sols reference, you'd think it would be something more metal, but i guess Daisuke just loves Queen that much
[0:56:33] <%wibbwobbler> doodWat
[0:56:34] <@Menitta> woolieGLORY
[0:56:34] <biggswedg3> probably tired like everyone else on this beta rollercoaster
[0:56:54] <Applecannon63> It would be cool if Ky had the rekka DI from Order Sol
[0:56:54] <lonosi55> Why is he concentrating if these are just casuals
[0:56:55] <BlackermanZX> reggie has to use the power of za warudo
[0:56:57] <freddiefreeloader_> I blame arcsys for fucking my sleep schedule
[0:57:04] <+Solid_Stro> You can see the concentration in Woolie’s face.
[0:57:07] <leith_aziz> Local play is always the most fun
[0:57:11] <+Solid_Stro> His eyebrows narrowed
[0:57:15] <the_super_suit> can we get reggie to face off against lil bussy man
[0:57:20] <wisconsinjoe> Ky seems like a gbvs character. Or rather, every gbvs character seems like Ky
[0:57:20] <leith_aziz> Shame about things now
[0:57:21] <+thecowpow> wew
[0:57:22] <Kitsunerasu> I blame twitch for messing with my sleep schedule majinLUL
[0:57:22] <BoxNavy> @lonosi55 he still wants to learn shit and play well of course hes gonna hyperfocus
[0:57:28] <+hoenhime344> reggieisms are STRONG today
[0:57:32] <%johnny_gogo> everyone out here lookin sick and then may just has 1 move
[0:57:39] <biggswedg3> Wheres Sin Ky? stop being neglectful
[0:57:43] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:57:43] <leith_aziz> Continuity
[0:57:46] <Zebroneath> Woolie's got shit LOCKED DOWN
[0:57:47] <%Asuterisuku> LUL
[0:57:47] <travelingwolfapples> sure
[0:57:50] <MichaelOfCainhurst> LUL
[0:57:50] <@Menitta> oh yeah I havent seen a single May this entire beta
[0:57:51] <metabot64> I still remember wasn't there some speculation that the new guilty gear wasn't even gonna be fighting game
[0:57:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie the sage
[0:57:55] <%gatorafan> @johnny_gogo, but that one move is enough.
[0:57:55] <%JustToWatch> ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN
[0:57:56] <+hoenhime344> thats a jojo character
[0:57:58] <+Solid_Stro> c4sageLUL
[0:58:03] <%that__tj> Dont fuck with Woolie, he will explain the GG lore to you
[0:58:04] <%ChoculaUltra> Axl is the coolest!
[0:58:09] <andre11dr> Arturo was raking ass with Axl
[0:58:12] <%Asuterisuku> Axl's idle stance is so bouncy and I love it.
[0:58:13] <wisconsinjoe> @great_tj lmao
[0:58:28] <%johnny_gogo> @gatorafan TRIE
[0:58:32] <leith_aziz> You've down alot of work Woolie. I appreciate how you streamlined stuff
[0:58:32] <+ikantreeed> @WoolieVersus U were sick. are u feeling better Mate?
[0:58:38] <the_super_suit> when's reggie vs lil bussy man
[0:58:40] <+Tai_Gai> Ky's range is nuts
[0:58:45] <%0rond> NARUHODO
[0:58:48] <+big_boi_bigg> I've seen a few Mays, zero zatos tho
[0:58:56] <%Noonoox12> @ikantreeed he sounds way better now than his tuesday GG stream
[0:59:00] <Applecannon63> really wish Ky had another super during DI maybe have his own deadly Rave like Order Sol
[0:59:07] <Darren716> I fought one Zato, just fought my first Nago
[0:59:12] <biggswedg3> Ive seen like no Axls anywhere
[0:59:15] <@Menitta> I've seen mostly Ram, Nago, and Gio
[0:59:20] <Darren716> Lots of Ram
[0:59:20] <+ikantreeed> @Noonoox12 he does!
[0:59:23] <metabot64> so i remember from the early on the lightning state just provides a damage buff right?
[0:59:23] <@Menitta> A few Millias
[0:59:27] <ItsKrisGBeanie> But the jacket staying on though 2020Suspicious
[0:59:28] <+Shishi1205> I think I've seen Ky the least
[0:59:30] <%JustToWatch> my favorite thing about guilty gear world building is that it's a post-apocalypse that is more advanced than it was pre-apocalypse
[0:59:31] <leith_aziz> For me I've seen Ramlethal the most
[0:59:32] <freddiefreeloader_> I fought Sol and Pot the most
[0:59:33] <leith_aziz> OOOHHH
[0:59:34] <+Shishi1205> then axl then faust
[0:59:34] <andre11dr> Ive seen some Zatos ,he's pretty good but not the most broken he's been
[0:59:35] <the_super_suit> is faust in the beta?
[0:59:37] <%Asuterisuku> Ride the lightning, Reggie!
[0:59:38] <+EtherwXlf> So chat, one thing I didn't notice is that if you're positive then you do more damage
[0:59:43] <@Menitta> Faust is in the beta
[0:59:43] <Darren716> I've actually faced 0 Fausts and Sols
[0:59:45] <%JaseAdrift> @the_super_suit He's in the beta

[1:00:30] <Darkred28> SOCIETY
[1:00:30] <biggswedg3> I once got hit by 3 megafists and I still dont know if im okay
[1:00:32] <leith_aziz> for cheap wins
[1:00:33] <yerbia> I dumping all my time into Gio
[1:00:36] <blckmgx> and people were confused why Ram came back
[1:00:43] <leith_aziz> ^^
[1:00:43] <+BirdoFan> reggie u should grab fred
[1:00:47] <@Menitta> I love Millia's stage. Its so gorgeous
[1:00:48] <Asuterisuku> Pot looks so good in this game.
[1:00:48] <%johnny_gogo> Why is there no frame data
[1:00:49] <+CaptainPyron> Pot's a weird matchup.
[1:00:50] <FacetiousAF> do big grab
[1:00:52] <+ikantreeed> CACA TES COUILLES!!
[1:00:53] <MichaelOfCainhurst> My boy Pot
[1:00:58] <andre11dr> Pot bodied me hard a couple of times
[1:01:06] <+Shishi1205> Kara cancel Potemkin buster reggie
[1:01:07] <+big_boi_bigg> I love playing as pot because no one knows how to deal with him yet lol
[1:01:08] <+CaptainPyron> I don't quite know how to fight back against him.
[1:01:14] <+Tai_Gai> Pot puts the fear of god in me
[1:01:14] <leith_aziz> Pot has been the most annoying matchup
[1:01:18] <@Menitta> The only Pot I played was against Pat and I got bodied
[1:01:22] <leith_aziz> And I played him for a while
[1:01:31] <+Ultimate_Edge> This pot is so dam strong. Why is he so safe
[1:01:39] <+CaptainPyron> And yeah, usually Pot and other graps are scrub killers.
[1:01:41] <andre11dr> @menitta How?
[1:01:44] <leith_aziz> Be glad this aint AC Pot
[1:01:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie getting last night ptsd
[1:01:47] <Darren716> This is the first time and I just picked Pot at random
[1:01:47] <Applecannon63> FAFNIR
[1:01:49] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Remember, it ain't a win if you didn't Pot bust him.
[1:01:51] <Darren716> I made a good choice
[1:01:52] <@Menitta> @andre11dr I am bad at video games
[1:01:54] <%Asuterisuku> Help, I can't stop singing along
[1:01:56] <biggswedg3> pot isnt just a scrub killer right now
[1:01:58] <leith_aziz> We wont deal with overheads now
[1:02:02] <+rusttyphoon> too bad for Reggie that Woolie is intimately familiar with the Pot matchup
[1:02:02] <metabot64> I just noticed sol doesnt even hold his sword by the handle but by the handle bandage?
[1:02:03] <biggswedg3> hes a monster
[1:02:06] <boros_user> SSSsss
[1:02:07] <+Shishi1205> AS Pot I suffer vs Ram, Axl and some millias and Gios
[1:02:09] <+teelor32> as someone who's never played guilty gear, this game is so fun to play and i can't wait to actually get it myself
[1:02:13] <andre11dr> @menitta Worst than Pat tho
[1:02:14] <MagumaDono> Sol Badguy vs Big Band, what a great matchup
[1:02:15] <+Tai_Gai> This game....it has a certain smelly smell
[1:02:15] <+Shishi1205> Also some Chips are stright up cracked
[1:02:24] <%gatorafan> That throw is WILD
[1:02:24] <+chiazam> Does Reggie now how to Pot Buster?
[1:02:24] <+CaptainPyron> That's funny cause I don't know how to fight him as Ram. lol
[1:02:26] <leith_aziz> WILD THROW
[1:02:27] <%Wool> The grappler got grappled
[1:02:30] <@Menitta> tbf I was playing Millia and that MU is a nightmare for me
[1:02:34] <+CaptainPyron> He just armors through all my stuff.
[1:02:35] <metabot64> damn that does a grip of damage now
[1:02:36] <Darren716> THATS A DQ
[1:02:36] <Darkred28> WOOLIE
[1:02:37] <Triplicat> DQ
[1:02:38] <leith_aziz> Sol is a grappler here im telling you

[1:04:48] <+CaptainPyron> White Ram is fine. I mean most of the other characters have dark skin alts.
[1:04:51] <%gatorafan> woolieMINHMAX
[1:04:52] <frostyjay3> Reggie... Phrasing

[1:04:59] <Solidnick18> she's got the thigh jiggle FeelsGoodMan
[1:05:04] <%ChoculaUltra> I miss her shark teeth FeelsBadMan
[1:05:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> he can't stop himself from touching her
[1:05:09] <andre11dr> It's weird how she just turns white on some colors
[1:05:10] <+WereVick> Of course Reggie would like Ram. She doesn’t wear shoes.
[1:05:10] <biggswedg3> rams intro is so gdlike
[1:05:11] <leith_aziz> I love the color mixing with Rams weapons and clothes
[1:05:13] <%Asuterisuku> I'm just a small part of the world BUT NO ONE CAN BREAK ME
[1:05:18] <Garrison27> this is another foot thing isnt it
[1:05:18] <%Moonblade92> @OldManDeckardCain Can't blame Woolie this time, Jwong has been commiting crimes against humanity this entire beta with Pot.
[1:05:19] <+Shishi1205> God this game is so Gorgeous
[1:05:20] <leith_aziz> More personality
[1:05:23] <BlackermanZX> she has like a 40 seconds taunt right
[1:05:29] <leith_aziz> Improvement from Xrd
[1:05:29] <+BirdoFan> hey woolz watch out for that grab
[1:05:30] <Solidnick18> beat extendooo
[1:05:30] <wisconsinjoe> LUL
[1:05:32] <stabbityrabbit> I hate how small Potemkin's head is. Any time he stands up straight it's all I see.
[1:05:33] <biggswedg3> @BlackermanZX i think everyone does
[1:05:36] <@Menitta> I hate Ram lmao
[1:05:38] <blackkanye> @CaptainPyron I've seen people get legit mad about it, but it never bothered me besides obviously prefering her normal skin color. It just alternate skin stuff.
[1:05:42] <smiggyballs13> OMG IS THAT 2B!?
[1:05:43] <therealtacopancakes> dem thighs
[1:05:45] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta dame
[1:05:45] <OldManDeckardCain> people who hate on white ram are the same as people who hate black skin on white characters LUL
[1:05:46] <rosencruez> dat thigh jiggle tho
[1:05:47] <+Shishi1205> same*
[1:05:51] <Zebroneath> CLOSE
[1:05:54] <defaultname3887> some give me a rundown on new tech pls, where do i look for it
[1:05:59] <%Asuterisuku> The zoning is real
[1:06:02] <biggswedg3> twitter
[1:06:03] <blackkanye> The thigh jiggle is nuts
[1:06:06] <andre11dr> Ram is fine, at least i don't hate her ass much as Elephant
[1:06:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> I see @menitta has bad taste, that's fine
[1:06:09] <Marshtomp1662> There's tags on twitter for each character
[1:06:12] <the_super_suit> Sajam on youtube
[1:06:13] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie doesn't know about tha armored approach move LUL
[1:06:14] <RocketBarrel> Of course Reggie mains Ramlethal
[1:06:16] <+Tai_Gai> twitter with the #ggst
[1:06:17] <defaultname3887> niiiiceee
[1:06:19] <blackkanye> @OldManDeckardCain Actually I would call them the opposites of those people
[1:06:22] <biggswedg3> RAM LETHAL
[1:06:24] <%gatorafan> @oldmandeckardcain, I'm pretty sure they are not, but they sure act like they are.
[1:06:25] <Solidnick18> eat giant sword
[1:06:25] <defaultname3887> thnak you guys
[1:06:26] <metabot64> yo did pot loose slide head or something?
[1:06:27] <DreTPK> sajamStare sajamStare
[1:06:36] <leith_aziz> Pot has slide head
[1:06:39] <%Noonoox12> @metabot64 nah
[1:06:40] <@Menitta> Her design is awesome in Strive but I hate playing as and against her
[1:06:44] <leith_aziz> Properties are weird
[1:06:44] <andre11dr> But Jack-O is easily the best new girl in Xrd
[1:06:45] <cheap_turbo> woolie knows ram from the moves beaten into him
[1:06:45] <OldManDeckardCain> the same type of person tho
[1:06:46] <+CaptainPyron> She maintains her mid screen advantage until she smells blood.
[1:06:46] <%blaccbird914> @metabot64 he still has it its blockable now though
[1:06:47] <%Moonblade92> god that swing with both swords deals more than nago's super
[1:06:51] <+CaptainPyron> That is Ramlethal.
[1:06:51] <biggswedg3> wheres your sister ram
[1:06:53] <@Menitta> Jack O is awesome
[1:07:01] <leith_aziz> Nope, Ramlethal > Jack-O
[1:07:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes, jack o is the best
[1:07:08] <umm_idunno> slide head just isn;t unblockable anymore, it has armour now tho
[1:07:11] <+BirdoFan> I want to raise puppies with her in the cabin we own
[1:07:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> but I can't play as her for shit
[1:07:20] <Solidnick18> Pupper PogChamp
[1:07:21] <%Asuterisuku> Puppy!
[1:07:22] <blackkanye> Rammy is really weird for me to try to pickup now. I haven't used a stick long enough that I'm unironically having trouble with two dauros back to back
[1:07:23] <ct_2> you just know...
[1:07:25] <SMuffinMan> PUPPERS
[1:07:25] <leith_aziz> PUPPY
[1:07:26] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ram just praying that her floating box cutters keep everyone out
[1:07:30] <+Solid_Stro> Hoping for Jack-O 🤞
[1:07:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:07:36] <BlackermanZX> doodbenny
[1:07:38] <%EldritchNeko> i haven't had this much fun with a fight game in years
[1:07:39] <Garry_Guyface> Thigh Physics Win
[1:07:42] <%gatorafan> LORE DOG PogChamp
[1:07:47] <Marshtomp1662> Potemkin's damage is big dumb in this game LUL
[1:07:48] <DrBeanie> can you flick the swords?
[1:07:49] <+teelor32> earlier today i was playing as Sol and when Ram went for her beam super i went for heavy mob cemetery and actually landed it, it was the most hypest thing ive ever seen in a long time
[1:07:49] <wisconsinjoe> Pot Kara cancels Kreygasm
[1:07:54] <ItsKrisGBeanie> woolieMIRIN
[1:07:56] <biggswedg3> her feet has to be cold
[1:08:00] <BlackermanZX> Aria will probably have Jack-O moves
[1:08:08] <Dave_VD> @DrBeanie That is a great question
[1:08:10] <the_super_suit> fr strive feels like the first month with dbfz
[1:08:12] <leith_aziz> I guess FAB must be in love with Pot here
[1:08:15] <andre11dr> Isn't Jack-O like a different person now or something,?
[1:08:16] <smiggyballs13> Schize
[1:08:17] <Applecannon63> apparently Ram's Beam can be RC'd
[1:08:18] <+BirdoFan> I bet Ram gets a move her pup b4 gio does
[1:08:18] <ct_2> We all know a.b.a is the last character cmon
[1:08:19] <Flowlethal> wouldnt it make more sense for aria to be like justice than Jack O
[1:08:21] <+DarkShadow124> That walk
[1:08:23] <%Moonblade92> Woolie throwing out the swords that won't connect to the corner hurts my soul
[1:08:23] <+CaptainPyron> Ram's got major "just got deflected in SamSho" vibes after sword projectiles. lol
[1:08:25] <+Shishi1205> Slow walk looked badass
[1:08:32] <%ChoculaUltra> the month wait after the beta ends tho - how will I live?
[1:08:41] <BlackermanZX> Jack-o became Aria at the end of rev2
[1:08:42] <Triplicat> you can play +R
[1:08:46] <leith_aziz> Jack - O is Aria now, Sol's wife/girlfriend
[1:08:47] <+Shishi1205> Nice
[1:08:47] <%blaccbird914> YOOO
[1:08:47] <+Mcmoblin> HERE COMES DAREDEVIL
[1:08:48] <+Ultimate_Edge> Very good
[1:08:49] <DaCheekyOne> GET SCOOPED
[1:08:50] <defaultname3887> btw woolie you're right by jwong on twitch for strive
[1:08:52] <%JaseAdrift> SICK REGGIE
[1:08:52] <+FuqBoiSlim> YESSIR
[1:08:54] <wisconsinjoe> OOOO
[1:08:54] <metabot64> that was some good shit
[1:08:56] <+Solid_Stro> @applecannon63 Yep, watched SonicFox RC the beam to Tbag c4sageLUL
[1:08:56] <leith_aziz> FLEX
[1:09:08] <%wibbwobbler> would not be mad at another jack-o appearance heck yes
[1:09:12] <+Ultimate_Edge> Congrats. Your heaven tier material LUL
[1:09:13] <%TrafficCohen> COUNTER
[1:09:26] <killaholic89> Would be cool if he blocked that heat knuckle
[1:09:27] <%gatorafan> Heaven belongs to Zepp!
[1:09:28] <+BirdoFan> Ah sick I didnt know Fred got hitched, good for him
[1:09:31] <Frogwash> I'm very new to guilty gear, how do you make potemking curl into a ball?
[1:09:32] <leith_aziz> Surprised many people want Jack-O back. Thought every one hated her
[1:09:34] <+CaptainPyron> Anyone else sadly getting server drops in the middle of matches right now? Seems to happen once every couple.
[1:09:34] <+Shishi1205> Potemkins 6HS deals so much dmg
[1:09:36] <blackkanye> I seriously love Rammy's grey skin. Just give me a dark skin variant
[1:09:37] <%Asuterisuku> Don't most of Pot's specials have armour?
[1:09:41] <@Menitta> god that damage
[1:09:45] <%JaseAdrift> so close
[1:09:49] <+Shishi1205> @Asuterisuku at least 2
[1:09:50] <wisconsinjoe> pheeeew
[1:09:56] <metabot64> wat was that? looked like a super?
[1:09:57] <+Shishi1205> Earth shake and head charge
[1:09:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Ram's second super is very nice
[1:10:04] <DaCheekyOne> @Asuterisuku Just Hammerfall and that faceslam move
[1:10:06] <leith_aziz> Well more power for the Jack-O fans
[1:10:10] <Flowlethal> ram has two supers?
[1:10:14] <leith_aziz> Yes
[1:10:14] <andre11dr> If Aria is playable i hope she has a instal were she just turns into Justice with the GG1 moveset
[1:10:16] <Marshtomp1662> Everyone has 2 supers
[1:10:17] <Applecannon63> Ram's Grey Skin is basically Kamen Rider Buster
[1:10:18] <biggswedg3> these characters are disgusting
[1:10:27] <+CaptainPyron> She's got a really quick invulnerable DP like super.
[1:10:34] <+BirdoFan> yo justice install would be sick
[1:10:36] <+CaptainPyron> Saved me a bunch of times.
[1:10:37] <%Asuterisuku> Wow the RISC
[1:10:47] <blackkanye> I definitely will play grey coat ram still sometimes though. She is adorable either way LUL
[1:10:51] <leith_aziz> Pot sliding in the corner
[1:10:58] <+0neReeler> HEUG sword
[1:11:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> exactly
[1:11:02] <+DarkShadow124> I love Ram
[1:11:03] <%ChoculaUltra> ya guys think they're saving Instant Kills for the full release or are they gone gone?
[1:11:04] <SunsetJack> Xrd Ram has issues cause of Blitz.
[1:11:04] <leith_aziz> Im going for normal color Ram
[1:11:06] <%Moonblade92> yeah RISC is really ez to get to extremely fatal levels. especially if you chickenblock
[1:11:12] <OldManDeckardCain> xrd ram wasn't meant to be played by humans LUL
[1:11:18] <blackkanye> @leith_aziz Always a good choice
[1:11:26] <andre11dr> Justice is the best GG waifu ,would snu snu
[1:11:27] <+Shishi1205> @ChoculaUltra I mean you can TOD with some characters already
[1:11:31] <+BirdoFan> whats with her meat coat though?
[1:11:37] <%Moonblade92> haters pretend ez chickenblocking means there is no disadvantage to jumping tho.
[1:11:40] <leith_aziz> Xrd Ram is deffinetely more unique, but because of that, not everyone could jive with that playstyle
[1:11:40] <Jaysky> Ram time
[1:11:47] <c60_Jam> Shishi1205 TOD's are awesome cinematics
[1:11:48] <blackkanye> Just bad choice since I can see a bunch of people sticking with normal color ram this time since I think it looks even better with how her design is now
[1:11:48] <Jaysky> That red looks great
[1:11:50] <c60_Jam> *Aren't
[1:11:54] <biggswedg3> the intros in this game are sooooo coool, its too bad theyre behind a 30 second cutscene about mankind
[1:12:08] <the_super_suit> do you think strive will acknowledge that sol is ky's father in law
[1:12:11] <+slickrick1121> does pot not have anti air
[1:12:12] <+Shishi1205> Yeah, that is true

[1:12:27] <leith_aziz> Xrd did with the Sol/Ky thing
[1:12:28] <+Tai_Gai> We live in a society
[1:12:29] <+Shishi1205> @slickrick1121 that thing reggie did is the antiair
[1:12:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[1:12:38] <Solidnick18> chipp FeelsBadMan

[1:12:48] <DrBeanie> chipp still looks fun
[1:12:48] <andre11dr> It's kinda sad that Destroyes seem to just be gone
[1:12:50] <+Ragnakawaii> normals do so much monkaS
[1:12:56] <leith_aziz> Too bad most people skipped the intros
[1:12:57] <DrBeanie> i'm gonna miss those teleports tho
[1:12:58] <+Shishi1205> Is chips tp Super full screen?
[1:12:59] <+Solid_Stro> Chipp gets deleted by everything c4sageLUL
[1:13:00] <%Asuterisuku> If Chipp makes a single bad read, he dies.
[1:13:01] <+slickrick1121> @Shishi1205 yep just happened right after i asked lol
[1:13:07] <%Holycow8498> When does Guilty Gear Strive come out fully?
[1:13:11] <@Menitta> tbf the intro is real long
[1:13:13] <@Menitta> April
[1:13:14] <biggswedg3> april
[1:13:14] <leith_aziz> IK's are either gone or saved for the full game
[1:13:15] <%ChoculaUltra> but Chipp tech is so fun to watch tho
[1:13:17] <+BirdoFan> "ur not my dadguy" - ky
[1:13:19] <+chiazam> And to think I was once excited to be a Chipp main
[1:13:20] <+Solid_Stro> I feel bad for Steeb shotoBless
[1:13:23] <blackkanye> If Sol and Ky played football at the family get together then it progressed into a full blown fight, I would lose it
[1:13:25] <leith_aziz> April 9th
[1:13:32] <+MyshkaMysh> I started with Giovanna and...have no idea what Im doing.
[1:13:33] <Applecannon63> @andre11dr they're planning to add IK in the full game
[1:13:33] <gulthrax> Potemkin best waifu
[1:13:36] <leith_aziz> For Strive's release
[1:13:36] <+Shishi1205> Meteor whatever
[1:13:37] <BurdRightsActivist> Who's potemkin?
[1:13:38] <+CaptainPyron> I'm not 100% but I saw a clip of Ram's DP Super 1 shotting Chipp.
[1:13:41] <SunsetJack> Garuda Impact or something
[1:13:43] <yerbia> green gio!
[1:13:44] <%illicitdonut> Pot just a moving slab of damage
[1:13:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can delay the QC back punch for more damage per swing
[1:13:49] <andre11dr> @chiazam I mean he's still good, just not get hit
[1:13:51] <+slickrick1121> @Solid_Stro what happened with steeb
[1:13:52] <@Menitta> YEAH
[1:13:52] <yerbia> green gio is healthy
[1:13:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> ZATO-1 KS WHAT I WANT
[1:13:54] <%Moonblade92> @the_super_suit It was referenced in Xrd, we are still unsure who is more terrified of them being related. My money is on Ky once he realized Sol's unique child rearing style
[1:13:59] <@Menitta> MILLIA LETS GO
[1:14:00] <andre11dr> That's how it's always been
[1:14:02] <leith_aziz> I wouldnt be surprised if IK's are gone, but I would like to see them back
[1:14:04] <TheGershon> Does that ABC thing denote how well they do at different ranges?
[1:14:04] <biggswedg3> this is my local matchup and the intro is still sick
[1:14:07] <DrBeanie> yeah never get hit as chipp
[1:14:15] <leith_aziz> The beast might be a gear
[1:14:16] <%wibbwobbler> great cast so far
[1:14:16] <%ChoculaUltra> @TheGershon yep
[1:14:19] <+OroOreo> yo she got that beast tech?
[1:14:19] <gulthrax> i like the american patriotism of this game
[1:14:23] <BlackermanZX> its a retweet button
[1:14:23] <leith_aziz> But it could be
[1:14:24] <TheGershon> Nice, that's really useful
[1:14:25] <+0neReeler> retweet
[1:14:27] <blackkanye> Yeah I didn't think it was one either
[1:14:29] <c60_Jam> ♻️ Recycle your materials, chat
[1:14:29] <+Shishi1205> That is true
[1:14:30] <%Asuterisuku> Recycle your plastics, pet the dog
[1:14:31] <@Menitta> I think Millia has the best redesign in the whole game
[1:14:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:34] <smiggyballs13> Twilight princess
[1:14:34] <+EtherwXlf> @WoolieVersus What if it's a forbidden beast and she had to sacrifice her dog for it
[1:14:34] <+BirdoFan> Everyone should get a dog in this game
[1:14:34] <@Menitta> Its so fucking good
[1:14:37] <leith_aziz> Gears are always tied to animals in looks
[1:14:41] <rosencruez> LORE
[1:14:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >inb4 it's Fenrir
[1:14:44] <the_super_suit> i want a family barbeque with sol, ky, and sin

[1:14:48] <leith_aziz> Zato now works for the gvernment
[1:14:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @huskarl_zap
[1:14:49] <Flowlethal> the wolf is isnt like eddit?
[1:14:52] <Flowlethal> eddie*
[1:14:53] <au_d3n> Zelda dowg
[1:14:53] <+Shishi1205> She's from the amazonas for sure, Iguazu, Jaguars etc
[1:14:53] <+Solid_Stro> Love and Retweet
[1:14:54] <%TubeMan642> She sacrificed combos
[1:14:56] <DaCheekyOne> Didn't Millia sacrifice her fertility?
[1:14:57] <DrBeanie> holy shit milias air dashes
[1:15:00] <%ChoculaUltra> idk if anyone brought it up, but Chipp's Gamma Blade is funky as hell in this one. Might just be a me thing
[1:15:04] <+MisleadingEchoes> Millia sacrificed her fertility
[1:15:05] <YungxFisher> cant wait for that part 3 lore video
[1:15:06] <gulthrax> they have cookouts in the backyard?
[1:15:08] <Applecannon63> I hope IK can be comboed/or be ultimates
[1:15:09] <%gatorafan> Giovanna sacrificed her dog's attacks Kappa
[1:15:10] <+CaptainPyron> Millia's super fast.
[1:15:10] <+Kenidashi> c o u n t e r
[1:15:15] <hamahiroyuki> also, cheking ost, potemkin's theme is name literealy named SOCIETY
[1:15:15] <+EtherwXlf> The question then becomes, where does it reside? Millia's lives in her hair and Zato's lives in his skin
[1:15:28] <biggswedg3> when the dog is a ghost its partially possessing her
[1:15:28] <TheGershon> Millia's sprite was the first time I really noticed animation. The hair is just such a perfect idea
[1:15:29] <gulthrax> look guys! she has a stand!
[1:15:32] <+solzan2000> giovanna so fun to use
[1:15:34] <leith_aziz> Zato had to give up his sight
[1:15:34] <SMuffinMan> Millia can set up a disc and then bad moon afterwards it's super fucked LUL
[1:15:38] <%illicitdonut> Anyone seen lil bussy mans (majin obamas) strive primer video? Pretty informative.

[1:18:03] <@Menitta> there it is
[1:18:04] <Marshtomp1662> LUL
[1:18:04] <Applecannon63> The dog transforming sounds like Millia'a Hair transforming back into regular hair
[1:18:07] <+Smack_Punk> its the sound the dbz characters have when their about to fly
[1:18:11] <FacetiousAF> yo millia lookin baller
[1:18:16] <%Asuterisuku> Do Burst supers still exist?
[1:18:27] <leith_aziz> No
[1:18:28] <andre11dr> Don't think so
[1:18:28] <@Menitta> Also her j.D is fantastic
[1:18:30] <SMuffinMan> Millia can double dash in the air
[1:18:30] <%illicitdonut> @wisconsinjoe woolieYE
[1:18:35] <leith_aziz> That was Xrd exclusive
[1:18:39] <+MisleadingEchoes> Millian is SO FAST damn
[1:18:46] <+CaptainPyron> What do you do when you live in a shoe and ain't got no Sol?
[1:18:51] <+Shishi1205> After playing Potemkin with no air dash or front dash this movement is getting me dizzy
[1:19:01] <leith_aziz> Dizzy huh
[1:19:01] <andre11dr> No burst super, no rejection, no danger time
[1:19:13] <MichaelOfCainhurst> @Shishi1205 same
[1:19:17] <+Shishi1205> you can grab burst while in the air right?
[1:19:19] <metabot64> was danger time a good mechanic?
[1:19:22] <the_super_suit> ohhh she's like filia from skullgirls! nice to see daisuke reference smaller games
[1:19:23] <leith_aziz> Danger Time being gone is for the best
[1:19:29] <+Shishi1205> Or at least I saw a twitter video of it
[1:19:31] <+Tai_Gai> ye
[1:19:32] <huskarl_zap> SQUAaaaah
[1:19:34] <Applecannon63> honestly Danger time was just redundant guts
[1:19:36] <leith_aziz> Danger Time I dont think was good
[1:19:45] <MichaelOfCainhurst> "wait, is there movement in this game?"
[1:19:51] <+Shishi1205> True
[1:19:53] <leith_aziz> It just gives me meter and I use DI
[1:19:56] <+Tai_Gai> Wish they kept instant kills tho
[1:20:04] <metabot64> @leith_aziz yo you gotta explain this. i don't understand?
[1:20:06] <+EtherwXlf> nago's dust isn't an overhead tho
[1:20:07] <@Menitta> Yeah I really like that grab is on dust
[1:20:07] <BlackermanZX> they said the would add IK later
[1:20:09] <leith_aziz> Again, we have no idea about IK's
[1:20:10] <+teelor32> i need to figure out Dust myself
[1:20:11] <huskarl_zap> When she *SQUAAAH* but you already nutted
[1:20:22] <andre11dr> I loved danger time, when IM HITTING but not when it getting hit in it ,so it a love hate relationship you could say LUL
[1:20:22] <+BirdoFan> dont make me press the mixup button.
[1:20:23] <%Akizea> yeah IK's are comin
[1:20:23] <metabot64> danger time was random and guts is a fixed variable?
[1:20:25] <+Tai_Gai> @BlackermanZX oh dope
[1:20:27] <Dave_VD> Oh shit do we get to play wollie?
[1:20:35] <biggswedg3> dust is universal overhead
[1:20:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so loremaster san, what is this stage

[1:21:02] <%TrafficCohen> Ayayayayayayay I can fly
[1:21:03] <andre11dr> Slayer got some DUMB damage in danger time
[1:21:10] <Garrison27> BOOSH
[1:21:10] <QuadyOfKippleEyes> GOOD BOOOY~
[1:21:11] <leith_aziz> Danger Time was when two attacks clashed, the game would freeze and after game counts to 3 the first who mashes wins BIG damage
[1:21:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> too bad May doesn't have the super where she goes ham in this game
[1:21:18] <+Shishi1205> What does Ky's electricity do?
[1:21:20] <+EtherwXlf> actually, maybe i'm wrong
[1:21:20] <the_super_suit> may blackface moments

[1:21:59] <+BirdoFan> Ky the helpless seal pup
[1:22:05] <biggswedg3> just tried it and its an overhead
[1:22:17] <leith_aziz> Danger time increased damage BIG time, guts didnt matter
[1:22:20] <Garrison27> I miss being able to jump on the beachballs
[1:22:29] <Jaysky> Her calling the dolphin does not at all get obnoxious sounding
[1:22:30] <+EtherwXlf> @biggswedg3 you right, I thought it was unblockable lol
[1:22:32] <Jaysky> Nope
[1:22:36] <leith_aziz> Danger time has nothing to do with guts

[1:26:55] <leith_aziz> Skip lobbies

[1:26:59] <c60_Jam> Quickmatch training is good
[1:26:59] <%Kaito_Cam> it's going to be my fist fighting game that I want to really learn
[1:27:01] <GhostRavens> yes
[1:27:02] <biggswedg3> I was legit scared to go to sleep because it might be down and never come back

[1:27:08] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[1:27:15] <+BirdoFan> Dust should be the dolphin button
[1:27:16] <Nekros4442> aw no park?
[1:27:27] <+mechslayer71> Guys, I’m lost as to how to deal with corner pressure and getting overwhelmed by attacks. I hear faultless defense is the answer, is that true? Does it make a big difference in getting openings?
[1:27:29] <%Asuterisuku> USE 10th floor!
[1:27:30] <+xerotwo> no Japan? doodStare
[1:27:31] <leith_aziz> Also once you enter a lobby, you can have the game load the stage you just fought in, which SKIPS loading
[1:27:36] <+Shishi1205> 6 people
[1:27:37] <%Double_Tap_That> @woolieversus Have your thoughts on Gio changed now that people have had time to learn more about her?
[1:27:39] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> i'm gonna try and not get recked
[1:27:42] <+xerotwo> HOO BOY
[1:27:43] <GhostRavens> ALL THE WARRIORS
[1:27:43] <andre11dr> Yea the lobby sucks, just give me a menu, what was wrong with just a menu
[1:27:46] <%johnny_gogo> ima get my ass beat
[1:27:53] <metabot64> yo being real though this lobby system looks ass
[1:28:02] <DianaTheAscian> I'm so hyped to lose
[1:28:04] <%baka_sugoi> LETS GET THIS BREAD
[1:28:05] <egressanon> @leith_aziz that's incredible
[1:28:05] <+Shishi1205> Yeah it takes a bit for the match but it works
[1:28:07] <DetroitSentai> there's also quick join from the main menu, dont know if thats in beta tho
[1:28:07] <biggswedg3> it plays like ass too
[1:28:08] <andre11dr> Shit im not at home :(
[1:28:12] <Dragon_Batman> Standby has been great
[1:28:12] <%Moonblade92> @mechslayer71 FD pushes people REALLY far back, so yeah it's very good. Also prevent chip
[1:28:13] <metabot64> what was wrong with cute 3d avatars?
[1:28:18] <+RealThiele> salty channel bet?
[1:28:20] <leith_aziz> This lobby just takes too long
[1:28:22] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo Axl
[1:28:25] <biggswedg3> its just cumbersome to use
[1:28:26] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie's avatar looking slick though.
[1:28:26] <BlackermanZX> the lobby is major ass
[1:28:27] <leith_aziz> I want functionality
[1:28:28] <valriot> Oh well thats much better
[1:28:29] <+Ultimate_Edge> Already miss Rev2 lobby
[1:28:34] <leith_aziz> first and foremost
[1:28:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[1:28:35] <+BirdoFan> If the game has that feature its hung
[1:28:35] <sunnythedrunk> @mechslayer71 Faultless defense is good, if your character has a reversal that's good as well. Mainly defense is just learning blockstrings and knowing when you can press a button. No character has endless pressure
[1:28:46] <leith_aziz> ZA WARUDO
[1:28:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> I can't get in that specific lobby damnit
[1:28:49] <+mechslayer71> @moonblade92 okay thanks, I had forgotten it was a thing previously tbh, hopefully it helps a lot @sunnythedrunk
[1:28:51] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> BEST INTRO
[1:28:51] <%wibbwobbler> hard mode as a character
[1:28:58] <scrublord009> I'm trying to join
[1:29:00] <biggswedg3> siiiick
[1:29:05] <aka_Jigawatt> ive seen his intro
[1:29:07] <+mechslayer71> @sunnythedrunk what’s the best way to identify when I can press a button?
[1:29:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> heh, he pauses before the "heaven or hell" nice
[1:29:12] <aka_Jigawatt> never*
[1:29:14] <+chiazam> I don't really see many problems with this Lobby system except for Rematch honestly
[1:29:17] <metabot64> do you still have to FD to block in air from ground?
[1:29:24] <valriot> Axl HAS to be a test for making time stop work in a JoJo game, please let it happen
[1:29:27] <%TrafficCohen> HELMET Kreygasm
[1:29:28] <Applecannon63> the avatars are kinda okay just wish they just move automatically in the background when you simply press pick a match
[1:29:29] <Triplicat> @metabot64 no, and it is bad.
[1:29:32] <%Wool> PERFECT
[1:29:32] <egressanon> i just want it to find matches for me while I'm in training mode. then I'm happy

[1:29:42] <leith_aziz> @chiazam: you are in the minority unfortunately
[1:29:43] <+Hollow_Mirage> The fact that Axl has learned to fully control the time slip he just randomly has been stuck in for the entire series is so cool
[1:29:43] <winner_92> so woolie been hittin the lab huh
[1:29:45] <dizimous> What a Big Dick move to give your existing character a time atop

[1:30:13] <+kumaprime> damn that was fast
[1:30:15] <+Suneater_Jerome> sending a message to lil bussy man
[1:30:17] <sunnythedrunk> @mechslayer71 It's character dependent, but you can tell what moves have high cooldown. Generally if they jump or run up after a blockstring it usually means the pressure has ended and they are trying to cotinue it
[1:30:18] <scrublord009> Eadt
[1:30:22] <%megaman_sentinel> that seems busted lol
[1:30:25] <Dragon_Batman> Dealing with the pressure as Nago is tough for me
[1:30:25] <OldManDeckardCain> isn't that every character tho
[1:30:25] <huskarl_zap> BEGINNER FRIENDLY GAME
[1:30:26] <+0neReeler> i like it when i'm doing combos
[1:30:28] <%wibbwobbler> doodwesker
[1:30:28] <+RealThiele> pot battle neva forget
[1:30:28] <revoltingimp> that was the shortest match ive ever seen
[1:30:29] <+b_aleph> woolie has no mercy
[1:30:30] <leith_aziz> Nago is badass
[1:30:31] <lbrownthedestroyer> Come Back in 1000 years Axl
[1:30:32] <%TrafficCohen> Woolie in Heaven ?
[1:30:33] <+mechslayer71> @sunnythedrunk okay, thanks

[1:30:37] <DianaTheAscian> man Woolies instance is already full
[1:30:37] <%Asuterisuku> Montreal is further East than people in the US seem to realize.
[1:30:38] <+kumaprime> Did that mean even pick up his controller
[1:30:40] <sunnythedrunk> @mechslayer71 Np
[1:30:42] <+DarkShadow124> There is a line
[1:30:42] <+BirdoFan> I love watching Wool's Nago lol
[1:30:42] <+CaptainPyron> Holy crap. First Chipp I've played and he's a nut.
[1:30:43] <Diego_Umejuarez> shoutouts to this lobby system
[1:30:44] <+yeknomlive> his aa is fucking huge too
[1:30:47] <andre11dr> I do love how Nago haa the same knockdown animation as Slayer, the vampires are so OP that even when they lose ,they don't really lose
[1:30:48] <Diego_Umejuarez> and by shoutout i mean tears
[1:30:48] <leith_aziz> Woolie fans
[1:30:55] <+penjaza> So far my most intense set was Potempkin vs Nago
[1:30:56] <metabot64> i guess it was sorta a barrier to new players, but it sounds like it impacted the game? could you elaborate how? @Triplicat
[1:30:58] <%Irridium> @kumaprime bro it was me and I don't even know LUL
[1:31:03] <+Solid_Stro> Nago makes you run Backo
[1:31:04] <scrublord009> So many nerds
[1:31:05] <sunnythedrunk> I really wish they kept the XRD lobbies those were the best
[1:31:10] <Applecannon63> its cool as fuck that Nago's mask just forms inside his dreads
[1:31:11] <%wibbwobbler> theres a line lmao
[1:31:14] <+Dropkick_Rabbit> Holy crap, I just realized I haven't been following you. What the hell. Been a fan of yours for years! Well, happy to finally change that.
[1:31:14] <huskarl_zap> lobby bad
[1:31:21] <+slickrick1121> this lobby is aids
[1:31:22] <+BirdoFan> GG vampires are my fav version of the monster
[1:31:23] <Jashter18> I think even if this game has killers it's gonna have a good newbie population
[1:31:23] <Dragon_Batman> You can use the menu to move to the player anywhere
[1:31:24] <sunnythedrunk> XRD lobbies with this tower system would have been amazing
[1:31:25] <leith_aziz> Worst mathup for me yet: Sol Vs Pot or Chipp Vs Pot
[1:31:26] <+NarcissistCactus> this is the real fighting game
[1:31:27] <$pluckrabbit> @woolieversus I HATE THIS LOBBY

[1:31:44] <+yeknomlive> I'd say park. other people are gonna have trouble finding games in this ranked
[1:31:44] <@Menitta> Parks would be better for stream fights too
[1:31:49] <zerointelligence000> This feels like such a step down from Granblue
[1:31:53] <+BirdoFan> wow getting mixed in the lobby
[1:31:53] <leith_aziz> I never had to much issue with Xrd's lobby
[1:31:55] <scrublord009> We need a park

[1:43:42] <%Kaito_Cam> Worst doctor ever
[1:43:45] <+chiazam> No more children
[1:43:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I think Faust actually died and then operated on himself
[1:43:50] <%Kaito_Cam> slamming a chair into your shins
[1:43:52] <andre11dr> So do we fully know all of Fausts items yet?
[1:43:58] <+BirdoFan> If I was Nago Id steal his shoes after I win
[1:44:02] <%Asuterisuku> I can't believe that didn't kill
[1:44:08] <%Wool> ahhhh gg
[1:44:10] <@Menitta> good burst
[1:44:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Good burst
[1:44:13] <+Mistah_AD> Is it weird that everyone has basically one super?
[1:44:14] <travelingwolfapples> Nice
[1:44:15] <gunstars20> Damn
[1:44:15] <%ChoculaUltra> ah damn that was a fun match
[1:44:15] <Solidnick18> no bite
[1:44:16] <QuadyOfKippleEyes> wow nice burst timing XD
[1:44:17] <DaKnightWarrior> S L A S H
[1:44:17] <Applecannon63> faust is the shell of DR Baldmen
[1:44:18] <vingadivo> thag super does no fucking damage wtf
[1:44:19] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> The long normals in this matchup just SPEAK to each other
[1:44:25] <smiggyballs13> Half the damn screen
[1:44:32] <+kennneh> You can burst the poke wtf?
[1:44:38] <andre11dr> Cause he definitely got some new items and those are important to memorize
[1:44:47] <+chiazam> jesus that range
[1:44:51] <+JustDeku_> Why is Faust so creepy looking now though
[1:44:57] <@Menitta> oh god they're all in sync
[1:44:59] <+BirdoFan> I love how sage-ey Nago is
[1:44:59] <TacoTangler> oh hey people actually got off the yellow
[1:45:00] <g0d_zill4> you can burst everything except supers
[1:45:03] <+Tragosavich> wow order now
[1:45:06] <+kennneh> Proabably went crazy again
[1:45:09] <%Moonblade92> the trumpet is new I think, afro, and uhhh, cat Faustling.
[1:45:12] <%Asuterisuku> I thought you couldn't burst throws.
[1:45:15] <huskarl_zap> BASED setting
[1:45:16] <+Tragosavich> I still cant tell who is where in that line
[1:45:17] <+yourfriendhannies> What did Woolie mean about circumventing the lobbies with training matches?
[1:45:18] <%Moonblade92> oh right also Bannana.
[1:45:18] <+yeknomlive> dont forget to map taunt
[1:45:24] <%Moonblade92> he lost a buncha tiems tho.
[1:45:27] <+EtherwXlf> damn i got booted for network error :(
[1:45:36] <Toni_Master43> @yourfriendhannies You can matchmake in training
[1:45:51] <%Moonblade92> items* he had Black Hole, Oil, trampoline, Poison, CHoco, Donuts
[1:45:52] <@Menitta> Dame Da Ne
[1:45:52] <Ahack13> How ya liking the game Woolz?
[1:45:58] <andre11dr> Meteors are gone right?
[1:45:59] <deltanova11> hellooo
[1:46:00] <+chiazam> Aren't there bots for like making a line for people to play on stream?
[1:46:01] <+yourfriendhannies> @rameiramaster Woah that's pretty interesting. Might have to try it that way
[1:46:01] <NotHereToStream> man i hate the r code loading bs
[1:46:03] <biggswedg3> matchmaking in training is just using the lobby but while in training
[1:46:04] <Diego_Umejuarez> @WoolieVersus training mode search doesnt actually circumvent the shitty lobbies, it puts you in one in the BG and people still have to walk up and challenge you
[1:46:06] <%Noonoox12> look at your numpad
[1:46:10] <%Asuterisuku> Take a look at your keyboard
[1:46:16] <%Moonblade92> @andre11dr No, meteors are in and they go off WAY faster
[1:46:19] <DDDorsett> Potemkin enjoyer PogChamp
[1:46:19] <%Kaito_Cam> can I post a link it's to an image
[1:46:20] <%CalderGaming> (not all keyboards have numpads anymore)
[1:46:20] <+ArsCaelia> wait is gio a gear? looks like she has a symbol on her head
[1:46:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 6 is forward, 4 is back, Hadouken is 236
[1:46:23] <%ChoculaUltra> it warms my heart when people genuinely want to learn about fighting game notation
[1:46:24] <KineticZen> Real gamers use rotary phone notation Kappa
[1:46:26] <%Kaito_Cam> it's of the button layout
[1:46:31] <+BirdoFan> If Pot had a dog it'd be Rottweiler that he holds like a puppy
[1:46:33] <%Asuterisuku> Notation assumes the player in question is facing Right.
[1:46:34] <+Ultimate_Edge> 2 = holding down, 6 = holding towards
[1:46:35] <%CalderGaming> @ArsCaelia unknown
[1:46:44] <andre11dr> @moonblade92 Fuck, i hopped they were gone
[1:46:44] <+Ultimate_Edge> so 2p = down punch
[1:46:48] <biggswedg3> thats the dog possessing her
[1:46:49] <dweebenheimer20> is it me or does the character select screen seem lacking compared to past iterations?
[1:46:50] <+valkuma> i still think numericals is the wrong choice.Tekkens notation is way better
[1:46:58] <%ChoculaUltra> its a universal system basically
[1:46:59] <Murdercles> personally i dislike it, just say down, back ,forward, whatever
[1:47:10] <Nekros4442> @Murdercles yeah but diff countries
[1:47:12] <c60_Jam> Numbers goes across languages
[1:47:14] <Dave_VD> It also translates between games and consoles
[1:47:15] <Toni_Master43> @yourfriendhannies Yeah, you still need to interact with the lobby if you want to play with friends
[1:47:18] <%Wool> THE WHITE ZATO COLOR

[1:48:07] <valriot> fuckin Cum Demon
[1:48:07] <+Annat3l> the problem with the tekken notation is that it uses df as down forward for example, which only makes sense to english speakers, that's why different countries have different notations for tekken, it's not universal
[1:48:08] <c60_Jam> "Milky"

[1:52:31] <+kenyr> Strive lore just being deduced or is it listed somewhere?
[1:52:33] <%baka_sugoi> When slayer and Nago held hands for a full minute nago became a vampire
[1:52:33] <xeros720> i doubt vampires even work the same in Guilty Gear world
[1:52:33] <DedlokPM> @blackkanye he also has the same down pose as Slayer when he loses a round
[1:52:33] <+jmstwn> Slayer bit Yasuke

[1:52:52] <+kennneh> How de we know he's Slayer's student?
[1:52:54] <+yanntheripper> Can we do a list? this is gonna be hard to follow
[1:52:55] <c60_Jam> Grapplers get no respek

[1:53:49] <andre11dr> Or play Sol ,he's a better grappler than Pot LUL
[1:53:49] <xeros720> I LEARNED THIS FROM YOU DAD
[1:53:53] <froglorn> grapplers are a necessary evil
[1:53:54] <+kennneh> @Applecannon63 They could just be from the same hood
[1:53:57] <+EtherwXlf> damn good shit :D
[1:53:58] <+vaporousTippler> Potemkin is a boss fight.

[1:54:13] <smiggyballs13> Just don’t be there
[1:54:16] <+EtherwXlf> this is my first fighting game, and honestly i just cannot succest against pot
[1:54:17] <+Shishi1205> It feels super good to play tho
[1:54:22] <DianaTheAscian> how did the pat matches go?
[1:54:22] <+Shishi1205> I love him
[1:54:26] <mothdude> I like the idea of Vampire obsessiveness causing them to always stick to a code. Whether Dandyism or Bushido or whatever.
[1:54:32] <MayorRev> I like to think pat mains potempkin because he likes to feel big
[1:54:34] <SomersaultJustice> pat crushed him
[1:54:34] <+l3sovikk> Is this good as a first time fighting game?
[1:54:35] <%ChoculaUltra> Gun Flame RC into Wild Throw works 80% of the time all the time Kappa
[1:54:37] <leith_aziz> If you wanna win with Pot, use Pot
[1:54:40] <Toni_Master43> @DianaTheAscian Let's say it didn't go well to Woolie
[1:54:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> everyone send your potemkin footage to sharpie on twitter
[1:54:45] <+Annat3l> yeah pot feels insane with the kara cancel specials
[1:54:53] <DianaTheAscian> @rameiramaster LUL
[1:54:55] <andre11dr> But he probably gets destroyed by Ram
[1:54:58] <smiggyballs13> @mayorrev You might be on to something
[1:54:59] <froglorn> @l3sovikk Seems to be thus far
[1:55:02] <leith_aziz> Not a better time to get into a fighting game
[1:55:03] <%Moonblade92> @leith_aziz Man you got no idea. early tests Sol Wild Throw did more damage than Potemkin Buster

[1:55:11] <+Shishi1205> Oh yeah Ram is not a fun match

[1:56:56] <valriot> LUL

[1:58:29] <+themightyquinn3000> Hey Woolie, Hey Reggie, aer you winning?
[1:58:34] <townzzzzz> the color is dante, if it was ragna the pants would be black
[1:58:36] <%Moonblade92> I'm not sure what;s worse about Bloodrage, it knocking them back or not? Both suck for Nago
[1:58:38] <+Shishi1205> Leo goes gorilla too
[1:58:41] <valriot> apes strong
[1:58:42] <+Ultimate_Edge> This game really likes gorillas more than ever
[1:58:45] <Dave_VD> Maximum unga bunga
[1:58:45] <+EtherwXlf> I've seen that mashers are big brain in their own right lol
[1:58:46] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I see
[1:58:53] <%gatorafan> Every time I see this lobby I'm reminded to not take THF's lobby for granted. daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:58:58] <andre11dr> If it's the +R version of sword people would NOT be ready for Zappa in this game
[1:58:58] <+0neReeler> gorilla swinging
[1:58:59] <+zetaplus> sol is really good at gorilla tactics so yeah
[1:59:01] <+Tai_Gai> Leo had directed unga
[1:59:02] <scrublord009> People who wakeup grab are crazy and like feet
[1:59:08] <%zeroarturia> Apparently the last character is going to be revealed soon

[2:00:20] <Toni_Master43> I'm no pansie
[2:00:20] <+TopTieramisu> ultra instinct is basically "don't think 4Head "
[2:00:21] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Lots of love for nago
[2:00:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Nago fights feel like they end in 6-9 hits tops and I am all for it. Samsho vibes.
[2:00:24] <%JaseAdrift> when a 2 head play becomes a 5 head play
[2:00:24] <+Mistah_AD> I really do wonder if they'll add in all the stuff like 'Destroyed' finishers and stuff, cuz right now it's lacking that good stuff
[2:00:28] <+Shishi1205> Only pressing backwards to do half circles
[2:00:33] <rcand9> nice
[2:00:35] <fr3sh4vocado> YE
[2:00:44] <@Menitta> See the line really needs to be spread out but we can't coordinate that because the delay of the lobby is wack
[2:00:44] <%baka_sugoi> GG the mirror is rough
[2:01:00] <$RudeRabbit> Reggie likes to watch
[2:01:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> I would like to get another shot with my ram but there's a loooot of people
[2:01:09] <+TopTieramisu> seeing nago makes me imagine an arcsys samsho
[2:01:16] <LoadingFWANK> i was about to ask that
[2:01:23] <+TopTieramisu> god... give arcsys ever fighting game franchise
[2:01:28] <LoadingFWANK> the corner situation
[2:01:28] <%GingaNZ> @WoolieVersus hey woolie, why the normal grab rather than the command grab for the blood meter drain?
[2:01:31] <patt_e_cakes> cant wait until this game drops
[2:01:32] <%ChoculaUltra> Ram monkaS
[2:01:33] <+Shishi1205> Oh a ram
[2:01:39] <andre11dr> Io i saw a Justice mirror in +R a couple days ago, BOY THAT'S CURSED
[2:01:41] <Heefnoff> Oh there’s a queue?
[2:01:42] <+TopTieramisu> every*
[2:01:44] <%baka_sugoi> its who UNGA first
[2:01:55] <%GingaNZ> damage rather than blood, gotcha
[2:01:56] <%Noonoox12> the command grab is worse in every way except for blood back, so it's situational
[2:02:00] <enerkaizer> what are the current bets on the final character? I'm at this point honestly expecting Bridget
[2:02:03] <%ChoculaUltra> @CaptainPileDriver also thank you for playing Coomer Zato for the stream when ya didn't have to!
[2:02:16] <travelingwolfapples> guy I have some bad news...pot can wave dash

[2:02:21] <sleepy_pink> yoooooo
[2:02:21] <%GingaNZ> I was looking at playing him so I wanted to know if there was a advantage to it
[2:02:23] <FunnyCrimes> ram's 214H hitbox is awful lmao
[2:02:24] <+TopTieramisu> final character will be baiken's missing arm
[2:02:26] <vingadivo> waifu KomodoHype
[2:02:27] <Heefnoff> Which lobby are folks in
[2:02:29] <+Suneater_Jerome> feelin either Ariels or That man
[2:02:30] <sleepy_pink> looks like woolie finally figured out the ram matchup
[2:02:31] <rcand9> going unga bunga is so fun to watch and play
[2:02:32] <Toni_Master43> @travelingwolfapples He can also air dash across the screen
[2:02:35] <SomersaultJustice> can you get command grabbed if you warp in to go for the grab?
[2:02:40] <%ChoculaUltra> Park 48, West Coast @Heefnoff might be full tho
[2:02:40] <+Suneater_Jerome> or Venom's rolling pin
[2:02:41] <Applecannon63> oh hey Ram's Kamen Rider Buster palette

[2:02:52] <%krispen_wa> Ram looks real weird when she's not choco
[2:02:58] <+Shishi1205> Got caught lacking
[2:03:06] <mothdude> They're probably going to save Aria and/or Asuka for dlc because they know people will shell out for them.
[2:03:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> boo white ram, boo
[2:03:09] <+TopTieramisu> so sick
[2:03:16] <%ChoculaUltra> someone said lightskin Ram looks like a vtuber and I can't unsee it

[2:03:25] <@Menitta> I love seeing people float up to the line blob
[2:03:26] <Applecannon63> again with the skin complaints geez
[2:03:29] <+Tai_Gai> They make counter the largest thing on the screen and i still don't capitalize
[2:03:38] <Toni_Master43> Wish they didn't change the skin colour on ram because those clothes look sick
[2:03:38] <Deadpool2450> Wanna talk about low health play Chipp
[2:03:40] <%thedankestmeeme> THAT IS A SEXY BROTHA
[2:03:46] <%gatorafan> @pyrrhus90, that's a freaking weird vibe to get from an animu girl daedra1DerpyTibs

[2:03:49] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Man I cant wait to play this game I always wanted to get into guilty gear
[2:03:57] <%Moonblade92> Asuka looks so lame tho. like a cover of a dime a dozen BL novel
[2:04:01] <%GingaNZ> in his case would you want to wall break every time just to reset to midscreen + damage?
[2:04:04] <FunnyCrimes> ram has some rly dope combos
[2:04:05] <FacetiousAF> @thedankestmeeme beauty not seen since barret took those sunglasses off
[2:04:05] <@Menitta> HEY NO SKIPPING

[2:04:31] <MagumaDono> DAMN THAT LINE IS LONG
[2:04:32] <Applecannon63> saying Asuka is lame is the most boring take
[2:04:33] <vingadivo> i love watching this game but I'm to poor to actually play it, so im enjoying it vicariously through woolie.
[2:04:37] <+TopTieramisu> which fighting game will not be a coward and have a lady maria guest spot
[2:04:37] <+0neReeler> playing gorilla = fun, fighting gorilla = notfun
[2:04:37] <mothdude> That Man being a catboy was the best decision the creators ever made.
[2:04:43] <DiscoDumpster> We got a bunch of line cutters in this chat

[2:04:55] <vingadivo> as they should
[2:05:01] <+Weeewer> they DEFINITELY focused balance, but made it flashy
[2:05:02] <TacoTangler> but how will we be esports readu?
[2:05:06] <%krispen_wa> Remember when Asuka J Kreutz was the focus of a FFXIV expansion?
[2:05:12] <%Moonblade92> It may not be a super original take but it's true. gimme XX's faceless That Man.
[2:05:12] <andre11dr> Ram is kinda ruined for me ,because everytime i see her name i can only thing of that old SBFC title LUL

[2:16:07] <@Menitta> I cant tell if I like this Ky design more or less than his old one
[2:16:09] <%Asuterisuku> Nago's theme is like heavy metal Come Together
[2:16:19] <@Menitta> its more casual which I dig

[2:17:35] <Applecannon63> I just hope Ky gets Di Rekka
[2:17:35] <+RealThiele> when the troubles are over
[2:17:36] <Solidnick18> oh
[2:17:39] <%Moonblade92> @Mistah_AD Probably story reasons, since in Xrd story there was a plot set in motion over at least 5 years to make Sol be unable to DI.
[2:17:41] <Darren716> Yes it is
[2:17:45] <c60_Jam> Wooliyuki

[2:18:14] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Anyone knows robotics in chat?
[2:18:16] <c60_Jam> T-Pain gonna get it done
[2:18:22] <MagumaDono> I don't have the mask tech, but I got the sewing tech
[2:18:23] <%Javaa01> I would imagine some furry out there has figured that mask tech out
[2:18:24] <@Menitta> I got u fam. Off to Solidworks
[2:18:26] <+RealThiele> punish
[2:18:30] <MagumaDono> Could definitely make most of Nago's outfit
[2:18:42] <Darren716> Am I the only one that hears slap instead of slash?
[2:18:44] <killaholic89> Going to need tony stark to make the mask
[2:18:45] <vingadivo> i still don't understand what ram does
[2:18:46] <%CalderGaming> hurts to see rams spend their swords at the wrong end of the stage
[2:18:50] <+Mistah_AD> Woolie certainly has the SWORD for the cosplay
[2:18:56] <+Mistah_AD> aka his literal stash of blades
[2:18:57] <%Noonoox12> @MagumaDono shoot woolie a tweet or highlighted message next break! Let's get this shit goin
[2:19:08] <MagumaDono> lol I'll bother him at some point

[2:19:25] <MagumaDono> Feral Ram is Feral
[2:19:33] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> You could have won if you didn't lose
[2:19:38] <%johnny_gogo> true ram messes up sol
[2:19:39] <%Javaa01> @Mistah_AD She can use them as big slash hits, or fire them out as projectiles, but then has to recover them after the fact
[2:19:42] <+TopTieramisu> just keep the mask on
[2:19:46] <MagumaDono> Contacts are assss
[2:19:48] <MagumaDono> not worth it
[2:19:50] <%GingaNZ> good call
[2:19:52] <IsaiahBlueFire> I’m still leading since this my first GG
[2:19:55] <Dragon_Batman> Well his eye color changes with each costume so hey it's ok
[2:19:55] <DianaTheAscian> never worth it
[2:19:57] <+RealThiele> dont put low quality shit in your eyes
[2:19:57] <WanderingYoren> Just do the Wesley Snipes method and get CG eyes
[2:19:58] <TheGershon> Big facts right there
[2:20:04] <MagumaDono> Wesley Snipes did it right
[2:20:06] <FacetiousAF> FeelsBadMan color contacts are shit? damn
[2:20:09] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, because they get those weird full color ones. Just blue should be fine
[2:20:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> People don't really notice eyes in cosplay unless you're like cosplaying an Uchiha
[2:20:19] <vingadivo> he teleported away
[2:20:23] <%Asuterisuku> I wore contacts for a while, but it's more trouble than it's worth.
[2:20:23] <andre11dr> How would you ever see out of that mask?
[2:20:27] <Solidnick18> for sure
[2:20:34] <MagumaDono> You could make the mask in many ways so you can see out of it
[2:20:37] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:20:39] <@Menitta> Oh god
[2:20:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah I ain't touching my eyeball with my fingers

[2:20:42] <@Menitta> yeah...
[2:20:43] <+Goku01899> get real non prescription ones
[2:20:44] <GhostRavens> jeez
[2:20:45] <%CalderGaming> @vingadivo things are pretty different in strive but her 236H and S throw her swords out, and you have to wait for them to time out and return unless you resummon them with a super. they have delayed explosions if you hit the far wall with them

[2:23:43] <DedlokPM> woolieMIRIN TALK TO THE HAND
[2:23:44] <metabot64> and I felt like high level narukumis stopped doing that cuz it was so expensive to do
[2:23:44] <vingadivo> when i first saw nago i thought he'd be broken but he seems pretty honest
[2:23:45] <MagumaDono> the feral has been defeated
[2:23:47] <FunnyCrimes> iirc ram has some specific combos on taller characters
[2:23:50] <%Moonblade92> @WutangchickeN Thanks man! Eastern Europe lyf means I can't buy games at will T_T Strive too good to pass up on tho.
[2:23:53] <Fooloraclown> Can anyone grab a match with Wools or is it like subs only?
[2:23:55] <+Tai_Gai> Woolie feeling the weight of the world rn lmao
[2:24:00] <%TheBesteban> Where you at?
[2:24:00] <blackkanye> @DaKnightWarrior The gameplan is actually more similar than people give it credit for. Just how you do the thing is different
[2:24:01] <jetjagger222> @vingadivo blood rage is a big temper on his damage output
[2:24:06] <+battlebeast67> @TwoandaHalfMopp Thanks
[2:24:08] <@Menitta> @Fooloraclown its a line but anyone can join
[2:24:10] <Murdercles> cant you teleport out of the corner?
[2:24:10] <%WutangchickeN> @Moonblade92 no worries my dude. GLHF
[2:24:18] <Dragon_Batman> It's Nago's corner, it's his special place BibleThump

[2:24:32] <MagumaDono> so there's some space
[2:24:34] <TheGershon> What would input delay be useful for? A buffer?
[2:24:37] <Pookiedaexzile> You have long ass Normals, stay back let the waves crash on you
[2:24:37] <daddyscumeez> @woolieversus will you be restreaming the roundtable later?
[2:24:39] <+Cobaltor_252> so on a scale from functional to why does this exist, how good is the lobby system?

[2:27:47] <+loukemia83> It's all about consistency
[2:27:48] <@Menitta> GG Reggie!
[2:27:48] <DianaTheAscian> damn
[2:27:55] <%Asuterisuku> I switched to stick because my pads kept breaking.
[2:27:56] <+Ultimate_Edge> Purple = cancel on whiff, Yellow = cancel block, Blue = empty cancel, Red = hit cancel
[2:27:58] <c60_Jam> Punk, Sonic Fox, TK Anakin to name a few pad players
[2:28:00] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Millia giving off Android 18 vibe
[2:28:04] <+Maplekon> you can be od and play on a guitar

[2:28:11] <Pookiedaexzile> ARe you Sonic Fox tho
[2:28:11] <JayEarly> zato doesn’t even need you to hold buttons anymore
[2:28:18] <%TheBesteban> nah I'll wait in line. just making my presence known
[2:28:20] <sunnythedrunk> Real Men play on Steering wheel like that one Kum player
[2:28:20] <scrublord009> Punk whiff punishing your life on pad

[2:28:26] <+Shishi1205> @Ultimate_Edge thnks
[2:28:27] <%Struggleful> I couldn't do dragon punches on pad or 360s on pad. Then I learned them on stick. Now I know how to do them on pad. It's weird
[2:28:28] <Solidnick18> i tried stick and pad but idk what's best for me :/
[2:28:30] <@Menitta> USA West 48
[2:28:32] <Aydarkzero> thankfully
[2:28:36] <+Weeewer> whens I-no
[2:28:36] <+BusterRepukken> I have to use a pad because Hitbox isn't usable on PS5.
[2:28:41] <@Menitta> I left the room lol
[2:28:41] <+JohnXuandou> pad discrimination is silly since all controllers are inferior to Hit Box
[2:28:48] <MagumaDono> there's definitely difference of representation between screens lol
[2:28:49] <DianaTheAscian> hes moding
[2:28:49] <%johnny_gogo> stick is really fun but i like pad i keeps me relaxed
[2:28:51] <FacetiousAF> oh fuck its buttons
[2:28:53] <andrewofbob> Kinect for fighting games
[2:29:06] <metabot64> wii mote for fighting games
[2:29:13] <Fooloraclown> Which room is it?
[2:29:15] <metabot64> ddr pad for fighting games
[2:29:16] <%Struggleful> DDR pad for fighting game
[2:29:17] <biggswedg3> lmao
[2:29:17] <FunnyCrimes> I'm using tilt controls!
[2:29:20] <+Shishi1205> That R code is a super trap
[2:29:20] <c60_Jam> No touch R-code
[2:29:21] <MagumaDono> R-code is a crime
[2:29:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Keyboard And Hitbox warriors stnad up
[2:29:22] <winner_92> the r code button is DEATH
[2:29:24] <Pookiedaexzile> We dpm
[2:29:25] <QuadyOfKippleEyes> tryin sorry!
[2:29:27] <+BusterRepukken> This lobby system is awful.
[2:29:30] <MagumaDono> it's hell
[2:29:30] <huskarl_zap> Mix users will be made to wear patches though
[2:29:31] <+Ultimate_Edge> R-code sends you to loading purgatory
[2:29:32] <biggswedg3> its awful
[2:29:32] <Kitsunerasu> power glove for fighters
[2:29:33] <+Shishi1205> Minimun 30 secs
[2:29:38] <+Shishi1205> Sucks super hard
[2:29:38] <@Menitta> "That little maneuver is gonna cost us 54 years!"
[2:29:40] <%JaseAdrift> The Rcode button is terrible
[2:29:40] <%Struggleful> @metabot64 Close one gg
[2:29:48] <MagumaDono> Everyone in the chat when Giovanna hits the screen "Gooood Boooooy"
[2:29:50] <GabFP> it took me the whole match to see woolies r-code
[2:29:56] <MKII> r-code puts you into the longest combo in the game
[2:29:58] <KSDM> S.S.H GOOD MUSIC
[2:30:07] <%johnny_gogo> as long as theres a rematch button and the servers dont go down all the time this could be the new smash
[2:30:08] <FunnyCrimes> not safe
[2:30:09] <JayEarly> honestly i wouldn’t mind this goofy ass lobby if it just fucking worked
[2:30:17] <c60_Jam> R-Code is meaty with no combo breaker
[2:30:21] <metabot64> @Struggleful ? uhh i think you might be wanting to talk to someone else?
[2:30:22] <+Shishi1205> S Hs works with everyone right?
[2:30:40] <%Struggleful> @metabot64 Nah we had the exact same ddr comment
[2:30:45] <biggswedg3> no one would mind if it just did lobby things
[2:30:49] <%CalderGaming> ram seems more frametrappy in strive too

[2:31:02] <MagumaDono> Burped on the desperation
[2:31:04] <+Ultimate_Edge> Hate to see it
[2:31:05] <%Asuterisuku> Reggie playing Ram because of course
[2:31:11] <JayEarly> I can adapt to this weird lobby, but it’s the unresponsiveness that makes me mad
[2:31:17] <+BusterRepukken> the Lobby makes you jump through so many hoops to play a damn match and then the match takes like 10 seconds.
[2:31:17] <357Sneak> so dnoGREEN lytDORF CI lytBEATSME E lytBEG ty
[2:31:22] <+Solid_Stro> Check this out c4sageLUL

[2:31:29] <MagumaDono> There's a sick Gio combo I saw where you get that Rekka kick into RC then air dust, dash air dust. It looks so fancy
[2:31:32] <MagumaDono> straight up marvel 2 combo

[2:33:06] <Picia000123> yo I wanna see that 93 lvl Axl
[2:33:10] <+Ultimate_Edge> @RowenCleric He gets less time with Eddie but it recovers faster now. Zato himself has way less going on now

[2:33:21] <+RowenCleric> gotchya thanks guys
[2:33:23] <%Moonblade92> Stop asking for Osol before we even got Robo-ky!
[2:33:35] <+RealThiele> LUL
[2:33:42] <DedlokPM> woolieKICKDAD woolieVS 🌐
[2:33:46] <metabot64> what about robo order sol
[2:33:50] <JayEarly> at least Robo Ky is technically a different character
[2:33:51] <killaholic89> More like robo why

[2:34:18] <%CalderGaming> 236H is a full screen width carry on hit
[2:34:22] <Fooloraclown> queue*
[2:34:25] <vingadivo> Wryyyyyyy
[2:34:35] <+BignanasTheGawd> is milia's moon punishable?
[2:34:35] <mothdude> Forget Robo-Ky. Give us Robo-Potemkin.
[2:34:38] <+kenyr> Chipp any good? dont see anyone playing him atm
[2:34:41] <JayEarly> oh shit an axl
[2:34:43] <+Kaiserzelcor> @Fooloraclown yes gotta hop in line
[2:34:47] <%Moonblade92> I like how X Robo-Ky was just a robot going full noroi, then XX had the lunatic womanizer toaster
[2:34:48] <+Shishi1205> Can you block Axl's comand grab? or do you have to just jump
[2:34:49] <metabot64> yo there basically needs to be robo versions of every character and even a double robo ky
[2:34:49] <+0neReeler> s hs, s hs
[2:34:51] <sunnythedrunk> Thousands of Xrd players are starving without their character and Sol mains want another Sol BibleThump
[2:34:53] <FunnyCrimes> @WoolieVersus if you want to convert off of S > H u can do her DP and RC it forward during the dash to get a combo
[2:34:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn girl, why yo thighs got phyisics
[2:35:06] <%CalderGaming> her calves do too
[2:35:19] <JayEarly> @pookiedaexzile bro everybody has physics, even the men
[2:35:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Kreygasm
[2:35:22] <FunnyCrimes> its hard but its real nice
[2:35:39] <MagumaDono> Just waitin' for the One Vision
[2:35:42] <MagumaDono> That move's evil
[2:35:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> qrc back kick is a kick that helps approach
[2:35:46] <+Ultimate_Edge> By the way. Seeing how that conference is tomorrow. Any guess on no. 15?
[2:35:53] <Pookiedaexzile> You see the joke is that I know he thighs have physics and I'm using it in a pick up line
[2:35:54] <Pookiedaexzile> see
[2:35:58] <%Moonblade92> @kenyr Basically Chipp without Teleports is a bad time. He's probably better than Nago and Zato, but no one wants to bother rn I imagine.
[2:36:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> and you can do it in the air
[2:36:02] <Zombrocom> Conference? When?
[2:36:07] <JayEarly> this is the first game ive seen with muscle jiggle
[2:36:13] <+Shishi1205> Spend that meter
[2:36:18] <FunnyCrimes> Chipp with teleports in this game wouldve been insane
[2:36:22] <FacetiousAF> @Zombrocom another fight game dev roundtable tonight at midnight woolie time

[2:38:56] <%JaseAdrift> man this lobby system is so annoying
[2:39:00] <%TheBesteban> I HATE THESE LOBBIES
[2:39:04] <$pluckrabbit> lobby has input delay
[2:39:04] <ProjektRF> This is a really cool bug that happens all the time
[2:39:06] <%JaseAdrift> WTF
[2:39:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:39:16] <andre11dr> Oh Bloody Roar ,has crazy jiggle on everything
[2:39:17] <%Struggleful> The lobby is the real fighting game
[2:39:17] <%TheBesteban> bruh
[2:39:21] <townzzzzz> playing on a different level of wi fi
[2:39:22] <+NarcissistCactus> this lobby really is the guilty gear
[2:39:23] <+BusterRepukken> this is the worst lobby system Arcsys has ever done, what were they thinking
[2:39:23] <+Ultimate_Edge> Ultra Instinct lobbies. Gotta catch them first
[2:39:24] <c60_Jam> LUL
[2:39:26] <Pyrrhus90> lobby needs netcode LUL

[2:39:41] <%kewlmyc> KING CRIMSON
[2:39:44] <winner_92> swear we're figuring out more tech to defeat the lobby than to defeat any character
[2:39:44] <+kenyr> this lobby is going into release?
[2:39:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> what is happening
[2:39:50] <MagumaDono> yeah :/
[2:39:54] <squidmax1> Jesus, what's wrong with a friends list?
[2:39:54] <%Asuterisuku> I think we're seeing server problems more than problems with the actual lobby
[2:39:55] <$pluckrabbit> finally
[2:39:57] <%Axle13j> There we goooo
[2:39:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >this lobby

[2:43:39] <MagumaDono> The real runback

[2:43:41] <zhenthrim213> i think im a may main
[2:44:12] <Aydarkzero> somehow i feel this isn't the game to comeback to after a generation of hiatus from fighting games LUL
[2:44:23] <+CaptainPyron> Nah, it's fine.
[2:44:27] <fran031> @Aydarkzero It's actually the perfect time
[2:44:28] <+CaptainPyron> It's new. It's the best one.
[2:44:29] <FacetiousAF> hwat is this pressure monkaS
[2:44:33] <+Mistah_AD> Even though there's still so much missing, it only makes me wonder what combat will be like in the final product

[2:44:59] <deviljhojho_> @Noonoox12 oh baby
[2:45:04] <DedlokPM> @Aydarkzero They actually intend for this one to be slightly more newbie friendly so it should be fine
[2:45:05] <Doughnut_Slayer> I haven't played it, but it seems easier to get into than previous GGs at least
[2:45:06] <%Asuterisuku> KOF XV NOT funded by saudi blood money please
[2:45:08] <deviljhojho_> thats what i want
[2:45:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OninKHd
[2:45:27] <%Noonoox12> @deviljhojho_ yeeeeeeee. I'm hyped for PC release so I can get my hands on 'em
[2:45:32] <+BusterRepukken> @Asuterisuku It's not. Yet anyway.
[2:45:37] <+Shishi1205> You always get the positive after wallbreak?
[2:45:40] <%Javaa01> @Asuterisuku Well, at this rate half the industry will be funded by Saudi money
[2:45:41] <MagumaDono> too soon I think
[2:45:44] <FacetiousAF> bawdied
[2:45:47] <+Shishi1205> Or only if you combo into wallsplat
[2:45:54] <+askalta> glad im not on a certain denver to hawaii
[2:46:01] <+Ultimate_Edge> I hope the 15th character is anti airs :)
[2:46:17] <MagumaDono> What's everyone's take on no 15?
[2:46:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:46:24] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, what will you do if 15 is Baiken?
[2:46:26] <MagumaDono> who y'all think we gettin?
[2:46:32] <andre11dr> This game definitely is not as unga as the last game, but you still get blown up just as hard
[2:46:39] <+Shishi1205> Baiken is for Dlc money
[2:46:43] <MagumaDono> ye
[2:46:47] <c60_Jam> You can chip in that state?
[2:46:47] <@Menitta> I want Johnny but I have doubts
[2:46:47] <%Axle13j> noice
[2:46:56] <MagumaDono> @Menitta I want johnny JUST so I can make a new cosplaty
[2:47:00] <Radioactivetaco9> he put the mask on to do the pose and then took it off
[2:47:02] <+BusterRepukken> Blod Rage gives you enhanced chip damage
[2:47:06] <+TopTieramisu> gotta milk the baiken stans
[2:47:13] <mtlsars> WorstWoolie vs Besteban lets go
[2:47:14] <@Menitta> Lmaooo nice
[2:47:16] <andre11dr> I think Venom and I-No will definitely be soon
[2:47:24] <+BusterRepukken> I hope Baiken isn't 15th because Baiken sucks.
[2:47:24] <blackkanye> So are forward taunts respects?
[2:47:28] <MagumaDono> Would LOVE to see I-no or Birdget or Zappa
[2:47:29] <blackkanye> still?
[2:47:30] <GhostRavens> they got abducted
[2:47:30] <c60_Jam> AngelThump
[2:47:32] <DaKnightWarrior> lytMOTIVATED
[2:47:32] <%ChoculaUltra> they've gone up to heaven FeelsBadMan
[2:47:33] <mtlsars> another one!
[2:47:34] <%Noonoox12> Woolie woolieVS Ascension
[2:47:35] <Garrison27> Baiken is the most free dlc money that there ever was
[2:47:36] <Monkeyweed21> no one actually plays Baiken even if they love Baiken, so its probably the "final boss" of Arcade Mode ala I-no or Ramlethal
[2:47:37] <mtlsars> DJ Khaled!
[2:47:41] <+hypecactuar> love watching u guys play this cant wait for the release
[2:47:41] <MagumaDono> Or Answer

[2:48:04] <andre11dr> Bring back Raven
[2:48:17] <AtisutoCurry> NICE
[2:48:25] <andre11dr> Raven was my favorite of the new Xrd caracters
[2:48:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> give me that big stupid monster
[2:48:26] <%Asuterisuku> Would've rather had Answer than Chipp
[2:48:27] <+BusterRepukken> oh they mad
[2:48:38] <+BusterRepukken> Besteban maddd
[2:48:48] <Brutusness> Slayer for dlc
[2:48:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Tempo is a Nago Problem
[2:48:59] <AtisutoCurry> NIIIIICE
[2:49:02] <%Axle13j> daaamn
[2:49:03] <FunnyCrimes> honestly if they put in answer id end up lookingo into getting a tat of his scroll and card
[2:49:04] <Mahuloq> I want to see a fighting game board game stream. Theirs some good ones out their, like Exceed and Battlecon.
[2:49:07] <%TheBesteban> the fake out
[2:49:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the throws
[2:49:11] <%TheBesteban> ggs
[2:49:12] <Monkeyweed21> I really want Elphelt, but its prolly gonna be a new character like Asuka or Ariels
[2:49:12] <MagumaDono> Ohhhhh that would be a good answer, super the flip
[2:49:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> when will they bring back LEOPALDON
[2:49:26] <%TheBesteban> you can also use 6p
[2:49:28] <c60_Jam> Woolie saw the code, at the last second
[2:49:35] <c60_Jam> The lines in the Matrix
[2:49:36] <%TheBesteban> but she's a mixup machine
[2:49:38] <andre11dr> If they do bring back Raven it better be Rev2 version so you can actually get excitment
[2:49:39] <biggswedg3> my favorite gio mixup is knockdown, dash, dash, button
[2:49:44] <%Wool> @TheBesteban I'm going to get back to heaven and kick your ass
[2:49:46] <Dragon_Batman> MAn that character poster bug is a drag
[2:49:47] <MagumaDono> I heard max say somethinga bout winning like 10 or someting in a row gets you into Heaven?
[2:49:47] <fran031> I hope it's That Man or Ariel
[2:49:51] <+saltpiggu> Hey woolie, 6P is a god button, combos into 214H
[2:49:53] <+BusterRepukken> My gigabrain take, GG should have a guest character and it should be Dante.
[2:50:00] <+BusterRepukken> forget dante in smash
[2:50:05] <%TheBesteban> @wool you're welcome to try anytime. I'll be waiting
[2:50:11] <MagumaDono> @saltpiggu you can also 6P into DPH
[2:50:12] <PerfidiousSinn> A lot of people always say you have to have good combos to be good at FGs and I highly disagree. Yes they definitely help but they’re not everything. My combos have never been my strong suit so to everyone out there: never let that demotivate you from getting better!
[2:50:15] <Monkeyweed21> @fran031 yea either one of them or a new boss character
[2:50:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck Dante in Smash, I want Dante in Guiltiy Gear
[2:50:24] <andre11dr> But do we want Dante or Nero
[2:50:30] <+Solid_Stro> Hesitate the Hesitation
[2:50:31] <MagumaDono> lol Dante in GG would be interesting just artwise
[2:50:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Bof dem
[2:50:33] <MagumaDono> would love to see that design
[2:50:35] <+Alabaster_> @woolieversus I got my hitbox cross up!
[2:50:37] <blackkanye> cum zato?
[2:50:37] <RamenRiderZ> resurrect Kliff
[2:50:38] <andre11dr> I say we get Nero
[2:50:47] <+Shishi1205> Dante RC Swordmaster Royal guard
[2:50:47] <%Axle13j> Kliffffff
[2:50:48] <@Menitta> I would LOVE to see Dante in this game's art style
[2:50:52] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @JumboManDraws
[2:51:00] <MagumaDono> Ity
[2:51:03] <MagumaDono> It'd be so fresh~
[2:51:08] <PerfidiousSinn> A lot of people always say you have to be good at FGs to be good at FGs and I highly disagree. Yes it definitely helps but its not everything. My ability to be good has never been my strong suit so to everyone out there: never let that demotivate you from getting better!
[2:51:09] <MagumaDono> Smokin' ArcSys Style
[2:51:13] <+Ultimate_Edge> Nah. They would make a new character that has Kliff-isms.
[2:51:16] <AtisutoCurry> I love seeing all these gio plays, I cant wait to get this on PC
[2:51:18] <+BusterRepukken> Dante already has fighting game experience, it'd be cool.
[2:51:19] <smiggyballs13> Oops he got his highlight message deleted lol

[2:53:54] <c60_Jam> WHAT?

[2:53:58] <MichaelOfCainhurst> LUL
[2:53:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Also Is that DArli on the Side
[2:54:00] <PerfidiousSinn> May is near impossible to win with at High level, people say she's broken, but have no valid or solid points to back up their claims. It's all just thin air cause they are losing to the player goated with the character instead of the character.
[2:54:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh

[2:58:47] <andre11dr> 15th caracter is actually a giant gear and it turns into TVC
[2:58:49] <SomersaultJustice> so what you're saying is they're bison's dolls
[2:58:53] <huskarl_zap> What happens to johnny after Xrd?
[2:58:54] <smiggyballs13> Dix-y?

[2:59:21] <Monkeyweed21> oooh boyyy
[2:59:22] <Mrsupergen> 15th character is A.B.A or we riot
[2:59:31] <zhenthrim213> @MisleadingEchoes dizzy is in the crew for like a few years
[2:59:32] <+Umigatsu> i don't remember if Bison's Dolls or the Jellyfish Pirates were created first
[2:59:32] <+saltpiggu> a perfectionist
[2:59:35] <Monkeyweed21> @huskarl_zap ask the feds
[2:59:44] <huskarl_zap> oh
[2:59:45] <andre11dr> But Nago is already A.B.A
[2:59:46] <MagumaDono> Could you imagine if May did the Beachball and it was independent of her getting hit or not?
[2:59:52] <%Asuterisuku> Eye to Eye grew on me.
[2:59:52] <+BignanasTheGawd> i hope next char is That Man
[2:59:53] <huskarl_zap> Pat was right again?
[2:59:53] <+Umigatsu> 15th character is Order Sol with Dragon Install :p
[3:00:00] <SomersaultJustice> whale do
[3:00:09] <smiggyballs13> Itadekimasu!
[3:00:14] <@Menitta> I really wish Millia's HS Tandem Top was independent of getting hit
[3:00:14] <huskarl_zap> If pat keeps being right then Idk how much longer the world has.
[3:00:17] <c60_Jam> 15th character is STD+ Ky
[3:00:22] <MagumaDono> you can also do that Double QCF S in the air
[3:00:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:00:29] <Monkeyweed21> they might do Ariel but she looks too similar to new Millia
[3:00:31] <stormhawk9891> Wait since when does Woolie know how to play May
[3:00:33] <ManfredA> if it's anything like Xrd don't let Rammy control the middle range
[3:00:35] <DedlokPM> @MisleadingEchoes after Dizzy was defeated in the the tourney she is initially put on the Jellyfish Pirates boat to hide. Think by Ky IIRC
[3:00:46] <JumboManDraws> Ram's tough as hell to play against
[3:00:48] <MagumaDono> Daaaamn

[3:01:35] <Garrison27> You guys seen a good Millia yet?
[3:01:36] <+Umigatsu> actually i think Sol, Ky and Johnny decide to let Dizzy join the Jellyfish Pirates, even if Sol didn't want to do anything after stopping everything
[3:01:43] <Monkeyweed21> I really wanna see the new IKs
[3:01:43] <Garrison27> That shits crazy
[3:01:46] <Mrsupergen> @dabeaminator try using the analog stick, its what i do

[3:02:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @stormhawk9891 ah, yeah woolie knows the basics for most characters it seems since playing nago requires that
[3:02:17] <andre11dr> Justice did have Eva colors in +R
[3:02:21] <+atmosqortz> GET EM
[3:02:22] <@Menitta> Blazblue had them for a while
[3:02:27] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Isuka had one LUL
[3:02:31] <dabeaminator> @Mrsupergen I find the analog stick misinputs a jump really often.
[3:02:31] <smiggyballs13> Get back into fighting games, Shinji..
[3:02:32] <+zalonar> yo uh... what rook are they at?
[3:02:35] <Storm_Samurai> What floor on the tower is this
[3:02:37] <rinjyu> I wish they'd let use mix and match the color parts from the existing colors a character has
[3:02:38] <+zalonar> *room
[3:02:39] <MagumaDono> Loooot of rams out here 👀
[3:02:41] <+EtherwXlf> Wait chat, I heard they're revealing the last character today?
[3:02:42] <+NarcissistCactus> pay for these colors we made for you
[3:02:45] <+Solid_Stro> Ram should get Nu-13 colors lytCIAO
[3:02:46] <+Umigatsu> is that Buddha Ships i'm seeing ?!?
[3:02:48] <Monkeyweed21> Imagine if the final character is just straight up Aria Hale

[3:04:08] <andre11dr> @magumadono That won't happen because Capcom are afraid that Arcsis would make Ryu interesting
[3:04:22] <MagumaDono> lol
[3:04:26] <dabeaminator> I can't think of a worse series than GG to start using guest characters. It has its own flavor, and guests would feel super out of place.

[3:11:15] <+Shishi1205> This pot should use the other super more
[3:11:19] <+Tragosavich> he played pat yesterday theres a vod on pat channel
[3:11:20] <MagumaDono> the fullscreen advantage of slide head too
[3:11:26] <+Ultimate_Edge> The pot should just spam mega fist

[3:11:40] <dabeaminator> Chat, is this a bad matchup for Nagoriyuki or is Potemkin just really good in general?
[3:11:46] <Darren716> Why does he keep going for Heaven
[3:11:48] <%Asuterisuku> Nago's health in range of Pot Buster - Oh, we're fine

[3:12:00] <+NarcissistCactus> potemkin health
[3:12:00] <Deadpool2450> no reason POT should lose this matchup unless they dont know what theyre doing

[3:14:49] <+Shishi1205> @Justfullof Use multihits
[3:14:51] <sunnythedrunk> Grapplers are the only minorities that deserve the oppression :)
[3:14:52] <%ECRead> People don't know what to do against good grapplers
[3:14:54] <+loukemia83> @MichaelOfCainhurst Not only are Grapplers Gamers, but even gamers hate grapplers
[3:14:57] <MagumaDono> Done
[3:14:58] <+Tragosavich> If you have full tension, can grab, cancel and then heaven them and it takes out like 80%.
[3:15:01] <Bronks_NYX> this Pot is way more passive than the last 1

[3:21:42] <Shardlab> @Asuterisuku The Black Beast did claw its way out and nigh on wreck the world
[3:21:54] <+Shishi1205> Unga their life away Reggie
[3:21:56] <+MisleadingEchoes> And potemkin is black so it's just as racist as in the real world
[3:22:00] <%Asuterisuku> There's the timeline divergence, then.
[3:22:09] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:22:10] <andre11dr> Watch the power of That Man just be a gun

[3:22:15] <+saltpiggu> I love grapplers
[3:22:34] <+MisleadingEchoes> Oh really? Had no idea
[3:22:38] <%Asuterisuku> Everyone ditched technology because Ragna the Bloodedge scared everyone.
[3:22:43] <c60_Jam> Watch Potemkin be West Indian
[3:22:47] <huskarl_zap> Lore on why Grapplers eat paint?
[3:22:47] <MagumaDono> Oooooo that punish
[3:22:49] <+MrGrakk> What do you think Venom is?
[3:22:51] <Dragon_Batman> I mean in the old games he is shirtless and is brown right?
[3:22:51] <Meltgar> Gabriel became chill with Potemkin right?
[3:22:52] <Marshtomp1662> Man that super is MEATY
[3:22:52] <+cubbywolf> hmm
[3:22:57] <+MisleadingEchoes> Always saw Potenkim as black but that would make sense
[3:22:59] <Deadpool2450> Venom is egyptian
[3:23:00] <+cubbywolf> pupper time is a good time
[3:23:04] <andre11dr> Is Slayer actually Romanian he is right?
[3:23:06] <$RudeRabbit> The India look is really obvious before he puts on the nazi uniform
[3:23:06] <warhand93> isn't zato spanish??

[3:23:13] <%jepupu> Ram is midrange. Not too good at other distances
[3:23:16] <%paladinstarbuster> Yo if Ragna walked out of a portal that would be so rad
[3:23:18] <%drefizz> Gabriel the angel?
[3:23:19] <+MrGrakk> I figured Venom was probably of Egyptian descent given the Eye of Horus looking symbol.
[3:23:19] <Bl4kDynamite> Any annoying Axl's?

[3:23:34] <GhostRavens> would love to see a GG character who's hispanic

[3:23:35] <Bl4kDynamite> I'm tyrying to learn some tech

[3:23:56] <+EtherwXlf> I assumed that Venom was more-so middle-eastern since he's an assassin
[3:23:56] <+kennneh> I miss Venom from this game man
[3:23:57] <stormhawk9891> And apparently Ky is French

[3:25:41] <+MrGrakk> Nago is Nigerian.
[3:25:41] <+Shishi1205> There's like 3 Japanese at least

[3:47:14] <Marshtomp1662> LUL
[3:47:19] <+Man_in_the_Red> @shishi1205 FBD is kinda a stance, letting go of the button within... too short of a window reflects
[3:47:19] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Chipp doesn't feel so good
[3:47:28] <metabot64> or I guess alpha counter is a more common term?
[3:47:38] <Fooloraclown> GG Woolie, been a fan for a long time, was a lot of fun getting to play you. Peace!
[3:47:41] <+Shishi1205> @Man_in_the_Red I imagine is that way for that reason
[3:47:55] <Bazal68k> @WoolieVersus Chipp has some wack unblockable overdrive setups though. That was the trade off.
[3:48:00] <theuncrownedruler> Imagine getting chipp to sit still long enough to build his risk gauge
[3:48:03] <+Man_in_the_Red> if Chipp had could DP after the second hit of his rekka he'd at least have something to work with
[3:48:28] <dabeaminator> Gio's the best. I'm very new to fighting games, so I appreciate having an easy to use character in the roster.
[3:48:35] <+MrGrakk> That has pretty much always been Chipp. Great toolset and mixups, no health.
[3:48:42] <+MisleadingEchoes> Weird that a serial killer is a joke character now.

[4:06:03] <Applecannon63> the question is if Gio is I-no in disguise why the hell did she became a police for the US president?
[4:06:04] <Daxalog> What even is faust?
[4:06:09] <+Man_in_the_Red> he always had the biggest aerial hitbox
[4:06:12] <c60_Jam> He can dominate the NBA
[4:06:12] <%Asuterisuku> A doctor
[4:06:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> the lankiest
[4:06:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> imagine faust crawling towards you
[4:06:14] <%ChoculaUltra> he's a doctor.
[4:06:17] <BlackermanZX> faust seems possesed like zappa
[4:06:17] <+Shishi1205> He also has that creepy bug molting move
[4:06:18] <+waltzqueen> @Daxalog a man, according to Diogenes

[4:07:19] <huskarl_zap> Voring Gio big dumper
[4:07:19] <Dragon_Batman> Gotta be careful ppl can catch the crossup special
[4:07:20] <+Zeroblazex> Youre doing the thing
[4:07:26] <laguerrilha> Also Jason mask, cutting the line is a nice way of getting no onw to play with you
[4:07:28] <+Shishi1205> I've seen like 3 infinites
[4:07:34] <+RealThiele> potential
[4:07:36] <dabeaminator> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Cool, good to know. I'd like to know what they're saying mid match.
[4:07:38] <%LastHazzerd> the cartwheel is tough to use tho, given how easy it is to get hit in it
[4:07:48] <Applecannon63> @dabeaminatoronly in XRD had it unless XX counts because of their trailer
[4:07:48] <%LastHazzerd> did he just molt?
[4:07:54] <+Shishi1205> Molting yeah

[4:08:27] <huskarl_zap> It's Astolfo
[4:08:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @dabeaminator yeah, I'll probably turn on dubs at the start to see what the taunts say
[4:08:36] <+Taisuru> Faust being all Dr. Baldhead again makes me kinda sad
[4:08:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> What's Woolie's plan if the last character is Baiken?

[4:18:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[4:18:03] <%CalderGaming> @Shishi1205 yeah I think it's tied to asset load. one day I'll try putting an SSD in my PS4...
[4:18:06] <TheFramedWarlock> Thanks Menitta
[4:18:08] <@Menitta> When does the beta end? Sunday morning?
[4:18:09] <%Akizea> @nekros4442 4 hrs
[4:18:18] <+CaptainPyron> Wait, really? The roundtable is tonight?
[4:18:25] <+RealThiele> oh nooooo
[4:18:27] <+Shishi1205> Yeah on a pro it might look better
[4:18:28] <Nekros4442> @Akizea it's at 9 pacific
[4:18:30] <rcand9> make this boy think before he attacks
[4:18:36] <Mahbonk> how can he slaps ?
[4:18:39] <lilibana> last character reveal is tonight, right?
[4:18:42] <+CaptainPyron> Intradasting.
[4:18:53] <%CalderGaming> @Shishi1205 I do have a pro, but it's still loading from a hard disk
[4:18:58] <+mental_mashup> So Nago is this game’s “you canonically can’t be me so I chill on the floor between rounds”
[4:19:01] <+mental_mashup> ?
[4:19:10] <+Shishi1205> So on a fat ps4 it looks even worse lmao
[4:19:17] <+Trajanic> will ps and pc have crossplay anyone know?
[4:19:20] <rinjyu> wish Ky had cooler lightning abilities
[4:19:23] <+SvenHolgersson> Naw thats just GG vampires
[4:19:23] <+CaptainPyron> How it goes for vampire characters in Arcsys fighters.
[4:19:28] <@Menitta> It will not have crossplay unfortunately
[4:19:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Roundtable Preiview: :"What If we put everyone on a bus so they could play together locally. Just have 24/7 FGC arcades...Netcode whats that"
[4:19:31] <lilibana> @Trajanic it wont
[4:19:35] <+jonboy204> no crossplay at launch
[4:19:37] <%Axle13j> G fuckin G that was great
[4:19:37] <+Trajanic> sigh
[4:19:37] <@Menitta> just between PS4 and PS5
[4:19:38] <IamJames4649> they said they want to add it someday
[4:19:40] <huskarl_zap> SHOCK STATE
[4:19:42] <+MisterCrimson> @mental_mashup he's a vampire so it makes sense he'd be similar in attitude to Slayer
[4:19:45] <%Akizea> my bad, thought it was 8 est right now instead of 7 lol
[4:19:50] <%Asuterisuku> Refine your mind
[4:19:55] <+SvenHolgersson> Chipp finally gets a win!
[4:19:58] <@Menitta> I REALLY hope they do. I got a buddy who loves guilty gear with no console
[4:19:59] <juxtest> I hear chip is enough sometimes
[4:20:00] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda scared for the PC port - Tekken 7 on PC is home to some of the most obnoxious cheaters. Straight up using scripts that auto parry lows and shit.
[4:20:10] <Brickston> @Pookiedaexzile I don't think "put all the players in a near-airtight capsule" is a great pitch atm
[4:20:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> would it be better to play this on ps4 or pc?
[4:20:18] <+Trajanic> no ps4 and cant find a ps5 rip me
[4:20:21] <MagumaDono> Hooooo man the Pot busters are sweet tonight~ UvU
[4:20:23] <Marshtomp1662> I am a less good Ky LUL
[4:20:35] <+CaptainPyron> These stall owners must really enjoy all these crazy people on their roofs.
[4:20:38] <+MTLxSpider> im honest Ky
[4:20:40] <+MTLxSpider> :)
[4:20:42] <rcand9> LUL
[4:20:56] <@Menitta> I was kinda worried when I preordered "am I gonna like this?"
[4:21:01] <@Menitta> That worry is fucking gone
[4:21:09] <%ChoculaUltra> same
[4:21:14] <+CaptainPyron> I'm just proud that I put up a decent fight as 1 of 1 Million Rams.
[4:21:27] <%Asuterisuku> Probably going to drop a Steam pre-order next month.
[4:21:30] <Mahbonk> i haven't played fightings games for the past years. But Guilty Gear is bringing me back into the mood lately
[4:21:34] <%ChoculaUltra> I even pulled the trigger on the Ultimate edition like a madman. Glad I actually ended up loving it LUL
[4:21:42] <+Shishi1205> Burst those my guy
[4:21:54] <+MTLxSpider> its not invinccible
[4:21:55] <@Menitta> Maybe its the honeymoon phase but I think this is gonna end up as one of my favorite fighting games
[4:21:55] <Marshtomp1662> I had to go for it LUL
