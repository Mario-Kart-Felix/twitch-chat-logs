[0:03:07] <%Conzanagi> Neat
[0:03:08] <+JustToWatch> It's a bit low, but it's consistent low
[0:03:08] <+MAGNUMB> bloody roar is tight
[0:03:10] <thesilverbard> Given the rate Woolie is going, I think 40 hours may be a better estimate
[0:03:17] <%ChoculaUltra> the Unborn is in that one!
[0:03:18] <%Conzanagi> Bring back Boody Roar
[0:03:24] <derap41> Tekken copy
[0:03:27] <YakumoYomi> Xion the Unborn hype?
[0:03:32] <%RyTYoung> @hassanico2 chat won't hold you to it dw :)
[0:03:36] <Snakes_dk> took me precisly 40 hours
[0:03:38] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Bloody Roar 3 is the shit. Precious memories
[0:03:41] <%koolaid_kevster> koolaid_kevster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! yo bro hope you guys are having a good day i know its double day but be sure to enjoy the time off!

[0:04:37] <YakumoYomi> Now I NEES that PC port
[0:04:38] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:04:48] <+jiggy_snipe> probably in December or whenever they do a complete edition like with Nioh 1
[0:05:04] <%Solidnick18> it's alot of hours
[0:05:17] <derap41> Its as hard as you make it depending on how you play it
[0:05:25] <+tehbeardedbard> pat woolie colab ?
[0:05:32] <%Lion_kun> Nioh 2>>>Nioh 1
[0:05:35] <derap41> Heavy Hammer spammer represent
[0:05:44] <+JustToWatch> yeah nioh takes time. if you wanted to really book through it you could multiplayer it though
[0:05:46] <@Menitta> Nioh 2 ie fire
[0:05:47] <%Solidnick18> the new boss is amazing
[0:05:50] <%Lion_kun> Regen build ftw
[0:05:54] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:06:13] <%Terrarp> Nioh has some of the dumbest side quests like two final bosses at the same time
[0:06:29] <derap41> And its works great
[0:06:32] <+rheviel> a game that actually improved upon itself?
[0:06:39] <+JustToWatch> TONFAS
[0:06:41] <%Solidnick18> they added a split staff
[0:06:45] <YakumoYomi> Man...do I really need to just suck it up and buy the PS4 version? I'm torn...
[0:06:45] <%Lion_kun> That sidequest is great farming.
[0:06:48] <derap41> Tonfas broken strong
[0:06:52] <@Menitta> #TonfaGang

[0:07:08] <+rheviel> tonfas you say
[0:07:39] <%Solidnick18> i'm ready for jail
[0:07:41] <%Terrarp> @yakumoyomi the complete edition on PC is a bit cheaper so maybe wait for the next steam sale?
