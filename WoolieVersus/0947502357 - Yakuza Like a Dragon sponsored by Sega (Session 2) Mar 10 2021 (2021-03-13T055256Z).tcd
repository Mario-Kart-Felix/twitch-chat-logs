[0:02:22] <DatAsuna> Well season 1 has filler

[0:02:27] <+skyheys> Chainsaw Man is better but sure dude
[0:02:28] <jorniev> what about the scarf in in the 3rd ed spoiling a plot point in the latest chapter
[0:02:29] <+Toppunchpoopbob> season 2 is the weakest but its still great
[0:02:29] <+nabs2099> @generalscpatton I actually watched it with my mom lol
[0:02:30] <%TKO552> season 2 could be seen as mids
[0:02:31] <RyuShinden> WHY DID YOU EVEN DO THAT???
[0:02:33] <majindusto> IT ISN'T BAD AT ALL
[0:02:33] <%Zanzibar_Junker> The manga ends next month
[0:02:35] <brachydios777> I need to get into 4 god damn it!
[0:02:39] <%jinking79> well anime took to long to come out for some
[0:02:39] <rcand9> oh shit im only in the anime how many episode am i missing from watching this stream?
[0:02:40] <%SpcOpsBear> Final Season is going to end well before the god-damn final chapter of the manga. Is there going to be a Final Season Part 2 or are they doing a damn movie
[0:02:45] <%ggbhtg> @skyheys Um.
[0:02:47] <andre11dr> Now im sure it's good, but is it really THAT good?
[0:02:48] <%Exiliator> Hard disagree
[0:02:49] <+Dova573> we talking aot?

[0:02:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Jujutsu Kaisen and Doctor Stone is right there, though
[0:02:54] <%psidefx> what mango?
[0:02:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @andre11dr yes
[0:02:58] <Kiryurules> AoT
[0:02:59] <majindusto> PEOPLE WHO DROP IT ARE COWARDS
[0:03:01] <frostyjay3> Because season 1 is kinda bad and I almost dropped it after that. The only reason I picked up season 2 was because of the long gap between seasons allowed the fanbase to calm down
[0:03:03] <@Solidus_113> Basement still the most worth it payoff in anime ever
[0:03:03] <+Dova573> I would aot mid part is the weakest
[0:03:03] <%kewlmyc> Manga ends next month, so be careful
[0:03:04] <%psidefx> got it
[0:03:06] <%Mtome> AoT manga is wack rn and I love it
[0:03:07] <+Dova573> say
[0:03:08] <%paladinstarbuster> Doctor stone is the shit
[0:03:10] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Final chapter is next month
[0:03:12] <Asuterisuku> @CappuccinoGuil Dr. Stone's good. AoT is better.
[0:03:15] <Xelhesia> read one piece and goodnight pun pun. berserk and vagabond are already acquainted with you
[0:03:18] <convo445> but aot started getting popular 8 years ago so it's an old one now
[0:03:20] <andre11dr> I guess i never went pass season 1 but still it seems crazy
[0:03:24] <@Menitta> there was a day of quarantine where I said "fuck it" and watched all of season 2 and 3 and it was SO GOOD
[0:03:26] <DatAsuna> I would say there's a better payoff than basement also in AoT
[0:03:28] <Kiryurules> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:03:32] <rcand9> ive only seen season 1 and it was ok
[0:03:33] <%livlinn> Manga is ending next month and I don't know how to handle it NotLikeThis
[0:03:33] <Karego_at> what's so good about dr stone? everything i hear about it just sounds uniteresting to me
[0:03:34] <grouchio> Marley Uniform on Episode 1
[0:03:37] <%dreadedcthulhu> jjk is fucking spectacular rn too
[0:03:39] <nintega010> @andre11dr it deserves it's respect. One of the only manga to get close to beat One Piece in sells.

[0:27:17] <grouchio> SEGAAAAAAAAA
[0:27:18] <Blank9> it's a huge difference playing the game twice
[0:27:19] <Karego_at> hell yea babey time for nishiki voice

[0:27:26] <%aram909> you can notice the differences in the subtitles
[0:27:26] <+Toppunchpoopbob> thats new for this version
[0:27:27] <EnkerDraco> The localization script is really good too
[0:27:27] <WaifusSansFrontieres> dub vs sub has never been such a difficult choice as with this game
[0:27:27] <%heartlesshealer> time for subtitles to be translation instead of captions. Witness the work <3
[0:27:27] <+FuqBoiSlim> SUBCHADS GET IN HERE
[0:27:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kreygasm Dual subtitles
[0:27:30] <PsychoPearl> Yeah the localization is great
[0:27:30] <+Chronobot> these games get ULTRA money
[0:27:32] <convo445> subtitles and dubtitles are amazing work
[0:27:37] <+DarkNerdShawny> dang, guess I gotta watch this later then since I can only listen right now smh =(
[0:27:37] <leith_aziz> I do think Chat is being too much of an ass against dub
[0:27:37] <+BloodyBurney> you'll get to see that acyually in the repeated cutscene
[0:27:37] <%Jiggisnipe> WHAT
[0:27:38] <RICE02> Weeb Mode BibleThump

[0:27:47] <+twohitgood> very
[0:27:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus so we're swapping every session?
[0:27:48] <teefpal> I prefer the dubscript to the subscript
[0:27:48] <Solidnick18> time for sub ichiban
[0:27:50] <+loukemia83> Japanese is just backwards English
[0:27:51] <%Superdandy96> Ah man
[0:27:51] <EnkerDraco> There is a sidequest that is way better in JP than EN
[0:27:52] <srv4254> i only care about the sub for 2 people they wont see for a very long time
[0:27:53] <CoffeeSlice> sad
[0:27:54] <thunka10> NO VEY
[0:27:55] <PsychoPearl> It's Nishiki
[0:27:55] <%Exiliator> Awesome
[0:27:56] <+UnwoundCaesar70> i don't believe u
[0:27:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> @leith_aziz huh? chat loves the dub fam
[0:28:00] <AndyAsteroid> The localization team is top tier on this one
[0:28:00] <+MrBaldachin> I definitely prefer JP for this game but when the work's put in, like they did here, the dub is legit
[0:28:04] <+thesickestzak> Sub as in subpar Kappa
[0:28:05] <%livlinn> AKIO PrideRise
[0:28:07] <ullyzeez> (dub is better)
[0:28:08] <enerkaizer> Woolie knows that ichiban is technically a returning va, right?
[0:28:08] <%guyalex> donno if you'll get to the karaoke in this quick look series, but the songs also all have both english and japanese versions that are both worth hearing @WoolieVersus
[0:28:10] <PsychoPearl> Adachi
[0:28:13] <%heartlesshealer> I love both, and seeing the work on the subtitles in both languages is great
[0:28:13] <+Stoogeish> Ichiban's voice is so much better in dub OMEGALUL
[0:28:14] <EnkerDraco> YO THAT'S BATOU
[0:28:16] <brachydios777> @loukemia83 I thought that was Russian
[0:28:17] <huskarl_zap> Ichibong is scary deep
[0:28:17] <GarbageNirvana> Both are good
[0:28:17] <EnkerDraco> ?!
[0:28:18] <CappuccinoGuil> And Ichiban is Nishiki
[0:28:19] <jcflyguy> This is one game where I actually think the dub is superior
[0:28:19] <EnkerDraco> Mind blone
[0:28:22] <convo445> he's amazing in karaoke
[0:28:27] <Karego_at> adadchi's voice is so good i love that va
[0:28:28] <Zeemod155> wait Batou and who else?
[0:28:31] <pmmori> Ichiban is kinda better in english
[0:28:36] <%aram909> @Zeemod155 SNAKE
[0:28:36] <brachydios777> Hey Nishki
[0:28:41] <ullyzeez> not as himbo
[0:28:44] <leith_aziz> The good thing that this game does in English is actually ADJUST the lipsyncing. Judgement didnt do this all the time and it showed
[0:28:46] <djblue_shift> wow that's just nishiki
[0:28:47] <djblue_shift> lol
[0:28:50] <+LegendaryButcher> hoh?
[0:28:51] <DSD24> Oooooh
[0:28:52] <leith_aziz> Ho ?

[0:28:55] <+Diredoe> Hooh?
[0:28:55] <%heartlesshealer> Infamous
[0:28:55] <DatAsuna> yeah real diff. subs
[0:28:56] <grouchio> ayaya
[0:28:56] <fIashman92> They sure do talk a lot faster in JP
[0:28:57] <AndyAsteroid> Batou is the best
[0:28:58] <+aram909> "too far back for my blood" as opposed to "too far back for my old bones to remember"
[0:28:59] <%shad8snake> kyoudai
[0:29:00] <%gatorafan> that's a nishiki
[0:29:01] <andrex2311> Hoh?
[0:29:01] <enerkaizer> One of the few games were both dubs are great. SEga is kinda on a roll with both this and the Persona series
[0:29:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> NISHIKI! T_T
[0:29:01] <PsychoPearl> Same as Nishiki
[0:29:04] <leith_aziz> Again, I like both versions of Ichiban
[0:29:05] <%patriotrenegade> Thats just Nishki
[0:29:07] <rcand9> its basically nishiki from 0
[0:29:09] <+DarkNerdShawny> ewww his voice is too deep in the dub yuck
[0:29:09] <+Nekros4442> thats a nishiki
[0:29:09] <thunka10> [Japanese Noises]
[0:29:12] <%heartlesshealer> too old for my blood
[0:29:14] <+Stoogeish> He's way too Nishiki and not goofy enough
[0:29:15] <hokkemika> nishiki :(
[0:29:16] <convo445> been like that for 6 but not kiwami 2 because that was still a ps2 game
[0:29:17] <+MrBaldachin> yeah the engine jump really added a lot of quality of life
[0:29:25] <Kiryurules> LORE PogChamp
[0:29:26] <%Exiliator> ?
[0:29:31] <+RealThiele> ILL KILL YOU

[0:30:29] <Augus7717> @WoolieVersus screens not formated correctly
[0:30:30] <rcand9> will you be switching back to dub or will you just pick the one you prefer?
[0:30:32] <DSD24> The only bummer about subs is that they don't translate the battle lines but that's every game like this
[0:30:32] <%ggbhtg> but they also didn't get ANY better LUL
[0:30:39] <PsychoPearl> I love both his voices
[0:30:43] <+FuqBoiSlim> @rcand9 there switching every sessiom
[0:30:44] <%Noonoox12> yes way better
[0:30:44] <%heartlesshealer> oh, yeah it is cutting a bit. Hopefully not too much

[0:30:51] <Prevot> does Ichiban not have any concept of time? jesus
[0:30:51] <ullyzeez> has woolie noticed the SEGA thing on the UI prompt?
[0:30:52] <enerkaizer> Remember the food items you held before you went to prison. They actually gave them back to you. 10+ year old food for health regen SeemsGood

[0:31:15] <+DarkNerdShawny> nah his voice is still too deep and serious toned for me in the subs
[0:31:15] <mortificent> is the volume a bit lower?
[0:31:18] <SomeOtherNeb> that line has strong Kiryu energy though
[0:31:21] <%Exiliator> ooh yakitori

[0:31:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> the deeper voice makes him more chuuni so it works out
[0:31:47] <restingbones> I honestly already miss the inherent sillyness that comes with the english voices.
[0:31:48] <%BusterRepukken> he still doesnt believe it
[0:31:48] <OblivionSword1> OMIIIIII

[0:32:09] <%Jiggisnipe> so hardheaded
[0:32:10] <ullyzeez> okay no thats is just nishiki esp when he's angry
[0:32:11] <%paladinstarbuster> hes just like hey bud
[0:32:12] <%X2Eliah> Ichiban sounds more nefarious in the Sub
[0:32:13] <+condemned_15> Isn't Ichiban's VA the same as Nishki's?
[0:32:16] <WaifusSansFrontieres> surprisingly nice man
[0:32:20] <%X2Eliah> And more light-hearted in the Dub
[0:32:22] <%Mattais88> Ichi sounds a little too cool in japanese
[0:32:23] <SomeOtherNeb> [Essence of Delusion]
[0:32:24] <Namillus> That sure is Nishiki

[0:33:29] <%ChoculaUltra> uh where was he hiding that bat monkaS
[0:33:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> I just realized, is levelling his intelligence social stat just raw memorization of nerd stuff, without any of the actual sharpness of true intellect? Because he never stops being a himbo.
[0:33:33] <xdeathknightx> The Japanese voice gets silly enough, we are just in serious ichiban mode, have to wait for dumb ass ichiban

[0:34:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ichiban WOULD say that
[0:34:13] <+Diredoe> LOOK AT JOB
[0:34:13] <enerkaizer> @GeneralSCPatton he slowly starts to act slower in the game. Not by much mind you, but he doesn't stay a full himbo
[0:34:15] <DSD24> New SKILL
[0:34:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Prett sure in the dub the yaluza was shaking down the cigarette guy
[0:34:17] <+Crippl3> There's a mod that gives Ichiban that t-shirt, it's great
[0:34:24] <+RealThiele> he only had 100 yen couldnt even afford cigs
[0:34:24] <+DarkNerdShawny> he's more himbo in English!!
[0:34:26] <restingbones> yeah he kinda sounds cuter in the english version. at least so far.
[0:34:27] <%SpcOpsBear> Japanese Ichiban is confident but naive. English Ichiban is dumb but earnest.

[0:58:49] <%big_laser_boss> it's closer to what that one dude from 5 had
[0:58:49] <exnuart> theres a pattern too
[0:58:50] <thelaxinator> @restingbones A C.C. Lemon is about 19cm tall. I know this. Because reasons.
[0:58:54] <+loukemia83> its a lot easier than 0, the patterns are fixed
[0:58:54] <Asuterisuku> The ball will always land in one of the nine squares.
[0:58:56] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s easy until you get different pitches
[0:59:05] <%jinking79> the fuckin Phoenix Fast Ball Special
[0:59:05] <+condemned_15> I tried doing this in 6 and got my ass blown out
[0:59:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theyre predetermined to a point too
[0:59:09] <Darren716> You can also cheat super hard at this one
[0:59:15] <quitebgamer> I had do get used to this one to get a certain piece of gear for later I'm just used to the one in kiwami 1

[0:59:22] <Mr_November> I do enjoy the fuckin Steely Dan riff in the background
[0:59:25] <fIashman92> They're preset so it's kinda broken lol
[0:59:27] <Blank9> I don't like that nothing counts but home runs
[0:59:33] <%TheMoenia> where is the american pitcher from kiwami 2?
[0:59:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> I fucking speedhacked this for slo-mo because I was tired of the grind and didn't realize the pitches were color-coded

[1:36:33] <WaifusSansFrontieres> Nick rocking that Merchant class from bravely default
[1:36:33] <NeutrinoInteraction> I mean I realize that the Japanese voice is probably more appropriate for the character, but I like Adachi's english dub too

[1:36:53] <Allenou> He's Brian HAWK
[1:36:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @thetrashman_sc they say Ichiban in the dub as play on words for number one? Nick said Mr. Number One here and said it like Ichiban Nipan
[1:36:55] <mortificent> oh I only watch GitS in english XD
[1:36:55] <%SpcOpsBear> Auto Recovery only works with skills

[1:36:59] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Do a big save.
[1:36:59] <pyjama_day> Adachi is indeed 59
[1:37:01] <Darren716> I think its for spells
[1:37:04] <restingbones> Snake will always be David to me
[1:37:04] <zedravan> or blackbeard
[1:37:04] <Blank9> only uses skills
[1:37:05] <TheSaltminer> he's Iskandar, King of Conquerors!
[1:37:05] <Wofoeh> Hes also THE STRONGEST BEING ON EARTH
[1:37:05] <+scwry> think its for MP healers
[1:37:06] <%heartlesshealer> Auto Recovery is skill-based
[1:37:07] <%BlueJoneleth> it's healing magic
[1:37:09] <PsychoPearl> Yeah Adachi is 59
[1:37:12] <+AkronymCLT> 18 YEAR OLD ONIGIRI
[1:37:12] <thetrashman_sc> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli yeah they do

[1:37:14] <Wofoeh> YUJIRO THE OGRE HANMA
[1:37:14] <ghoststalker> He’s Rin’s grandpa from Yuru Camp now for me
[1:37:16] <NeutrinoInteraction> Adachi's English voice makes him sound like a cool uncle
[1:37:19] <CappuccinoGuil> auto-recovery is skills
[1:37:19] <%heartlesshealer> Auto Recovery will NEVER use your items <3
[1:37:20] <OblivionSword1> it's only with healing skillls like in perrsona
[1:37:20] <%shad8snake> its for healing skills
[1:37:20] <+RealThiele> its a DQ addon for healers
[1:37:20] <%Dante_Namikaze1> you need the skill I think
[1:37:22] <solracc25> Back to PECKING DUCK psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace

[1:41:20] <majindusto> Yakuza 0 is Totally Ruined now for Woolie BibleThump
[1:41:22] <KaiserMario> Check the manga section
[1:41:23] <ALTRNico> We have these in Asia tho
[1:41:24] <SoulKarl> so you all need to keep reminding woolie how easy the combat is and keeping him from ever leveling heavily. It will pay off with some amazing clips later
[1:41:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WHERE BREAD TECH
[1:41:26] <%MrPedrovsky> Is CC Lemon sponsored by Astoflo??

[1:41:53] <Darren716> ATMS are super important
[1:41:53] <qwazzeon> Keeping Woolie weak for a funny clip later seems like a really bad idea.
[1:41:54] <%LordSDB> Okay I wasn't the only person so saw her eyes like that LUL

[1:51:44] <PettyFunk> All enemies will block your regular attacks if they’re in the way of your target. Skills will not be blocked
[1:51:44] <+MrAtheGreat> That remix is the best one in that game imo
[1:51:45] <+BloodyBurney> leveling up restores stats

[1:51:56] <%tank7013> That one area gets two of the best songs in the game easy

[1:52:27] <President_valentine> yup
[1:52:28] <Brothermanhyll> god the one-two hit is so satisfying
[1:52:32] <Am_Shigar00> Job up is also a heal
[1:52:32] <%mikesapartment> job up is also a heal
[1:52:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Job up IS a heal
[1:52:35] <engineboi> job up also heals
[1:52:35] <DSD24> Every level up should always be a here
[1:52:35] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus no both heal
[1:52:36] <ALTRNico> job up is a heal
[1:52:37] <%faeron93> Job up is a heal
[1:52:37] <DSD24> heal
[1:52:39] <+Solutha> both r heal
[1:52:40] <dante_suoh> Job up is also heal
[1:52:40] <TheCrispyBoi> both
[1:52:50] <grouchio> Not yet
[1:52:51] <Doctadaking> Strategic level ups could be used as heals
[1:52:56] <Brothermanhyll> He scales big
[1:52:58] <%bPlusPlus> punching bag not tank
[1:52:58] <convo445> eating inside the battle actually has animation
[1:52:58] <restingbones> okay, thanks for the answers guys. I guess I missed it if they mentioned that :)
[1:53:04] <red_fox_zero> Adachi is kind of flimsy at first for a tank.
[1:53:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes saluting The Boss
[1:53:18] <%psidefx> He's doing his Christian impersonation
[1:53:28] <%Noonoox12> AGREED
[1:53:29] <dukenux> yes
[1:53:33] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:53:34] <%osaka_daioh> yes its the right way
[1:53:35] <aka_Jigawatt> yes
[1:53:35] <Klefth> Except in Pokemon.
[1:53:35] <jcflyguy> absolutely
[1:53:36] <dinnydanny777> nah too easy
[1:53:37] <%BusterRepukken> the christian coalition, i miss it
[1:53:39] <$Fortunato5678> Always
[1:53:42] <jcflyguy> Especially in Pokemon
[1:53:43] <%paladinstarbuster> It does
[1:53:44] <Maleicus> pokemon people are crazy
[1:53:45] <+Ancopro> agreed
[1:53:46] <Asuterisuku> Pokemon was always easy.
[1:53:46] <+teriyaki_drinker> yup
[1:53:47] <+mars_driver> That's because Pokemon is piss-easy to begin with
[1:53:48] <Brothermanhyll> Oh well of course the pokemon people
[1:53:48] <velgaduere> well this is a differently balanced game
[1:53:51] <+RealThiele> missingno rare candies baybee
[1:53:52] <dinnydanny777> Pokemon is piss easy anyways, the problem is difficulty scaling.
[1:53:52] <Solidnick18> i love the grind
[1:53:52] <@Solidus_113> Pokemon, the RPG for children
[1:53:53] <+scwry> no pokemon just did it poorly
[1:53:53] <%tank7013> It also fucks with EV grinding yea?
[1:53:55] <SixthShinx> It made the game too easy because the games weren't balanced around it @WoolieVersus
[1:53:55] <Prevot> game freak doesn't know how to balance, so...
[1:53:56] <Xelhesia> but pokemon is always easy tho
[1:53:56] <NeonBleu> I don't agree with poke people
[1:53:57] <linSP> Should be partial exp gain
[1:53:57] <dukenux> >listening to Pokemon fans
[1:54:02] <%Dante_Namikaze1> fuck them I play pokemon and if the XP share is it on they fucked up
[1:54:02] <velgaduere> that's all there IS in Pokemon, so yeah, it makes the WHOLE GAME too
[1:54:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> I used exp share all the time back in the old games
[1:54:03] <Brothermanhyll> This game has nothing to do with pokemon whatsoever
[1:54:03] <Klefth> Oh, it actually automatically overlevels you in Pokemon and trivializes the game LUL
[1:54:04] <velgaduere> easy
[1:54:05] <qwazzeon> If pokemon difficulty is needing more mindless grinding to get your stats up, it's bad difficulty.
[1:54:05] <peanutdot007> The worst of them is when you can have a party member knocked out and they miss exp
[1:54:05] <randominternetsurfer> absolutely
[1:54:05] <WaifusSansFrontieres> exp share in pokemon fucks with the competitive stat stuff right?
[1:54:06] <PsychoPearl> An item
[1:54:07] <%BusterRepukken> Ichi doesnt use weapons for this class
[1:54:07] <%mikesapartment> hardball is a usable
[1:54:08] <honeyman18> item use
[1:54:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> S-Links determine the XP Share on the bench woolieGASM
[1:54:08] <convo445> there is no difficulty in Pokemon so they'll try anything to make it harder
[1:54:08] <djblue_shift> that's just because pokemon has piss poor balancing
[1:54:09] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Item you can use in fights
[1:54:10] <%Lion_kun> Fuck them
[1:54:12] <Scorchfield> to be fair, i think those people who complained about that in Pokemon were a minority
[1:54:14] <%paladinstarbuster> grinding is fun if the game is fun
[1:54:16] <samazam94> it fucks up ev grinding
[1:54:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> There's like a 1000 of those fuckers.
[1:54:18] <%Mattais88> If it lowers the amount of exp teh front line gets, then just do away with it.
[1:54:20] <+MrAtheGreat> gamefreak never bothered to learn how to make game
[1:54:20] <+zepelinnn1> the exp share being busted just made me use a super OP pokemon in the start and never switch LUL
[1:54:21] <Solidnick18> yeah it's just a item
[1:54:22] <HeroToxiko> Poke people also keep buying pokemon despite being mad about it so i don't trust em
[1:54:22] <NeutrinoInteraction> The only people who really hate exp share are the competitive players because it actually fucks up their stats
[1:54:24] <420mangojuice> do japanese like yakuza or is this a for foreign ppl thing?
[1:54:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Every single RPG should have no restrictions on EXP sharing. There is no exception.
[1:54:26] <solracc25> Obligatory XP share is bad. Optional is good
[1:54:27] <dinnydanny777> People wrongly blame exp share for the games being pathetically easy
[1:54:33] <Am_Shigar00> I always hate early Pokemon grinding without exp share due to how long it takes to get the early pokemon up to snuff.
[1:54:39] <YaminoRaiden> Pokemon is already basic bitch easy, so exp share saves boredom
[1:54:42] <%jinking79> Didn't it mess with pokemon states in old games
[1:54:51] <+ChubbyPencil> that thud always gets me lmao
[1:54:53] <Am_Shigar00> huh, I never used those so I've never seen that before.
[1:54:54] <+teriyaki_drinker> if you want 1 pokemon to level up equip 1 pokemon
[1:54:55] <KingVantq> i forgot the stream today NotLikeThis
[1:55:05] <ghoststalker> @420mangojuice Ryu Ga Gokuto is popular in Japan, yeah
[1:55:20] <Darren716> Woolie mash A when you knock an enemy down to try and get a follow up
[1:55:32] <Darren716> Since your partners can follow up too
[1:55:42] <brachydios777> Japan must hate that Monster Hunter movie
[1:55:42] <brunoberserk> ikuzeeeeeeee
[1:55:45] <%jinking79> Ok it was stats problem
[1:55:51] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @Darren716 this is fake right? Please tell me this is fake
[1:55:54] <ghoststalker> @darren716 that’s a thing that comes later
[1:55:57] <Am_Shigar00> sewer leaf; perfectly safe.
[1:55:58] <%aram909> save them
[1:55:59] <Solidnick18> gives you mp
[1:56:02] <Doctadaking> Adachi will probably level up next fight
[1:56:07] <+Luzasaywa> .n
[1:56:07] <artoflec> I WANT MEMES
[1:56:14] <Darren716> I thought you could do it as soon as you get a party member
[1:56:18] <andre11dr> Man,Adachis regular hit is so brutal looking
[1:56:19] <Brothermanhyll> "tell sabu to FUCK SABU"
[1:56:28] <Darren716> I remember doing it the whole game and having someone deal extra damage
[1:56:39] <Asuterisuku> The map filling in as you go is neat.
[1:56:43] <%aram909> no sneak attacks unfortuantely
[1:56:43] <dante_suoh> @Darren716 need sufficient bond
[1:56:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:56:44] <%jepupu> Not by dashing that's for sure
[1:56:47] <$hattrick61> no
[1:56:48] <Darren716> AHh
[1:56:51] <%BinaryFireball> there are always secret messages but the in jokes are too in for us
[1:56:52] <Xelhesia> no
[1:56:56] <engineboi> 11 does
[1:56:57] <%Dante_Namikaze1> yeah DQ has sneak attacks
[1:56:59] <Am_Shigar00> I'm honestly not the biggest fan of the game's sewer dungeons. They're just a bit too plain and visually dull to me. Other dungeons are great though.
[1:57:01] <peanutdot007> Yes but its random
[1:57:03] <%ThatMLPgamer> dragon quest does, this doesn't
[1:57:03] <%tank7013> 11 does sorta, not sure about some of the others
[1:57:05] <AvroEltz> when the yakuza is sus
[1:57:08] <samazam94> please dont give "advice" unless you know for sure ie. actually played the game
[1:57:16] <Xelhesia> dragon quest is the same as it was in the 80's
[1:57:19] <CappuccinoGuil> @Darren716 follow-up attacks work only if an enemy is on the ground and it's their turn. The assist follow-up attack is different. It unlocks later, the higher the bonding with a character is. At max level, they are pretty much guaranteed.
[1:57:31] <honeyman18> just keep sharp
[1:57:33] <Brothermanhyll> when in a sewer dungeon, just think about the cutscene budget
[1:57:35] <Brothermanhyll> think about the BREAD
[1:57:50] <Darren716> That may be why I'm mixing it up, I maxed Adachi's link pretty early and always had him in the part
[1:57:52] <Darren716> *party
[1:57:59] <andre11dr> Looking back at the early part of this again it's crazy how much more they add to the combat as you progress
[1:58:03] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @GilliamYaeger
[1:58:04] <convo445> it's timing
[1:58:08] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:58:12] <@Solidus_113> dude
[1:58:13] <DingusMcBaseball> lol
[1:58:13] <Doctadaking> Camera can sometimes take too long to pan to your character, and you take a hit before you can see it coming
[1:58:15] <Prevot> I wish it was a bread dungeon instead
[1:58:19] <+Sleepy_Puma> I am so glad chat is not full of "SUS" bullshit :)

[1:59:46] <GilliamYaeger> @Dante_Namikaze1 Oh yeah fuck grinding, but as I said they don't balance the game around the XP share. If you're fighting everyone you quickly outlevel everyone you fight, when you should be remaining at parity.
[1:59:47] <dukenux> They sent yakuza thugs here as a punishment
[1:59:49] <+Sleepy_Puma> Poon raider

[2:00:00] <red_fox_zero> This entire game is team attacks and follow ups. I imagine it'll be your shit, Woolie. Lol
[2:00:03] <SolidusA> or maybe hes lying how many there was
[2:00:04] <DSD24> @brachydios777 "You cannot kill me in a way that matters"
[2:00:07] <TheCrispyBoi> 200? more like 20,000

[2:00:31] <ALTRNico> depends on class
[2:00:33] <mortificent> at least with Uncharted theres the excuse of competing against a warlord or rich asshole
[2:00:37] <Darren716> It's his default, the same way Ichi's default is bare fists

[2:01:31] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Jobs have set weapon types they must use
[2:01:31] <+Crippl3> fists are ichibans weapon
[2:01:33] <%aram909> auto-recovery is a skill based thing
[2:01:34] <@Solidus_113> auto is spells only
[2:01:35] <+JustBlubs> Ichiban's bare handed because the weapons for his current job are Fist
[2:01:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Auto-recovery is skills
[2:01:37] <%aram909> and nobody has any recovery skills yet
[2:01:39] <+Toppunchpoopbob> for heal skills
[2:01:39] <+king_of_beggars> Weapons are tied to jobs. The only barefisted job is Ichiban's Freelancer.
[2:01:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @mortificent doesn't change the fact that Drake has killed more people than all the villains combined
[2:01:42] <Am_Shigar00> it needs spells to work.
[2:01:42] <%BlueJoneleth> Weapons are job dependant
[2:01:44] <honeyman18> only skill based heals
[2:01:47] <red_fox_zero> Nope.
[2:01:48] <%shad8snake> heal skills
[2:01:51] <OblivionSword1> auto recovery use healing spells like in persona
[2:01:52] <%heartlesshealer> Auto-recovery is -never- items in this game
[2:01:53] <Scorchfield> auto will not use items, you need healing skills
[2:01:55] <convo445> if auto would use items would people rage?

[2:28:33] <Kiryurules> LUL
[2:28:33] <T_Sasquatch> He speaks way faster than i expected
[2:28:33] <+eldrinos> fun fact of the day: nanba's actor played Hideaki Anno in a comedy
[2:28:34] <$QueequegTheater> @SeruraRenge WOw how could someone be this wrong
[2:28:35] <passserby> nanba'ss dub voice doesn't really fit him imo
[2:28:35] <PsychoPearl> He's modeled after his voice actor
[2:28:37] <OblivionSword1> I like english Nanba
[2:28:37] <%doomerskeletor13> @serurarenge What are you smoking
[2:28:38] <DSD24> Nanba has good English VA
[2:28:39] <Halospaz117> @SeruraRenge Fucking EXCUSE YOU!?

[2:28:44] <+azures_arts> can we switch back to English
[2:28:45] <qwazzeon> it's a shame Nanba has by far the worst japanese VA in the game considering he's such an important character

[2:28:50] <+McSoliace> i prefer eng nanba by a lot ngl
[2:28:51] <+JustBlubs> I don't think his English VA is bad, just different like that last boss
[2:28:52] <+lordericter> wow this homeless dude sounds the same in the dub
[2:28:53] <+the_vedo_show> *oos
[2:28:53] <@akuda_bar> they're always the biggest bros

[2:34:16] <Blank9> The best part about that Nishiki gun scene is Nishiki's model is actually floating off the ground because he's that much shorter than Kiryu. But his legs are off-frame.
[2:34:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @notsoy yep, Nanba is the one im shocked at, i didnt realize he was a model, i thought all of Ichis party was original

[3:07:16] <Am_Shigar00> god, I love the Yokohama battle theme
[3:07:18] <SeruraRenge> I hope you like Nanba because the game is going to force you to use him for a long time. Which is a shame because statwise he's like the 2nd worst party member and you're going to get very used to waiting for him to run halfway down the street to attack a target because for whatever reason it happens a lot.

[3:16:02] <enerkaizer> so.... How much did Pat tell him about a certain character...?
[3:16:05] <ALTRNico> the Koreans are basically idols

[3:16:08] <brachydios777> They have been
[3:16:09] <velgaduere> this is a local branch
[3:16:11] <%Dante_Namikaze1> They did in past games
[3:16:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You dont need to know the old games they said Kappa
[3:16:12] <Darren716> They usually call them both mafia
[3:16:13] <Blank9> only specific groups are triads
[3:16:14] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus The Snake Flower Triad is a different group in Japan
[3:16:18] <andre11dr> Yeah in Yakuza games the Korean mafia is THE REAL DEAL
[3:16:18] <velgaduere> not mainland triads
[3:16:18] <Asuterisuku> Different organizations.
[3:16:24] <teefpal> Isn't Triads specific to USA Chinese mafia?
[3:16:31] <$QueequegTheater> no
[3:16:37] <SeruraRenge> @teefpal No that's the Tongs
[3:16:38] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> They do in other games, the Liuman aren't a triad, just a chinese mafia
[3:16:44] <+kamikazecashew> kiwami 1 had the snakeflower
[3:16:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> I mean it's not always just foreigners, the omi are also almost always bad
[3:16:52] <SeruraRenge> @kamikazecashew And 3
[3:16:53] <majindusto> Triads are in a bunch of the games
[3:16:53] <brachydios777> @teefpal Nah, they are a force in the previous games
[3:16:58] <Darren716> Ichi knows how to play the gang game, doesn't know what the Cold War is
[3:17:06] <Kiryurules> NEW PLOT
[3:17:07] <ghoststalker> They always call the Triads “Chuka Mafia” in Japanese which translates to Chinese Mafia, but the subs translate it as Triads
[3:17:13] <WaifusSansFrontieres> the most evil characters in this series who do the most irredeemable shit are all japanese
[3:17:13] <%doomerskeletor13> New plot acquired
[3:17:14] <ALTRNico> gang
[3:17:25] <velgaduere> "what the fuck is the Cold War and why didn't they just wear jackets"
[3:17:31] <+v8bitecho> the Yokohama Yakuza is literally Japanese though
[3:17:33] <majindusto> No
[3:17:34] <%wibbwobbler> might as well LUL
[3:17:34] <Brothermanhyll> I love that ichi is savvy about gangster underworld shit and literally nothing else
[3:17:36] <solracc25> Sparking Ichi
[3:17:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the foreign gangs took over your gang, so Ichi is still involved
[3:17:39] <teefpal> NEW QUEST: DEFEAT THE IJIN THREE
[3:17:48] <RetributionP> involved? whhhaaat? we are just learning about the land
[3:17:48] <Namillus> So basically, Ijincho survives on its Unstable Equilibrium
[3:17:49] <$QueequegTheater> @WaifusSansFrontieres Aside from Jo in 6, and the Koreans in 2, and the Koreans in 6, and Lau Ka Long, and
[3:17:51] <DSD24> I like being super chill
[3:17:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this is about the Omi, who his old boss is now captain of
[3:17:57] <%livlinn> oof these cold war metaphors joofbSweat
[3:18:11] <Kiryurules> Big nuclear war allusions
[3:18:18] <+taggerung403> The Vacant Space
[3:18:19] <ghoststalker> @emptyantics depending on where in China they’re from, Canto-pop or (more likely) Mando-pop
[3:18:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> resources are the city
[3:18:26] <hassanico2> @QueenOfCuteCows That leaves at least 4 games' worth of far more Evil Japanese yakuza
[3:18:27] <Namillus> The Omi doesn't want to come in here and blow it all to hell
[3:18:30] <Sternieliscious> This Cold War is a real Twilight Struggle, if you know what I mean.
[3:18:32] <fIashman92> They're fighting for cans
[3:18:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Yokohama is the homeless, got it
[3:18:34] <SeruraRenge> It's less resources and more territory
[3:18:47] <Kiryurules> Control of income streams
[3:18:50] <majindusto> Ichi be spreading, yo!!!
[3:18:50] <hassanico2> @QueenOfCuteCows sorry pinged the wrong person
[3:18:50] <+condemned_15> dolla dolla bill yall
[3:18:51] <ghoststalker> @teefpal HK had a huge triad problem too
[3:18:53] <Brothermanhyll> yokohama's resource is jittery dudes
[3:18:53] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @QueequegTheater sucks I cant counter your point by bringing up all the much more evil villains because thats spoilers
[3:18:57] <thunka10> The real pain of sub only is missing things when I tab out NotLikeThis
[3:19:05] <brachydios777> It’s clear later on what ijincho is about
[3:19:05] <mortificent> Sotenbori is more traditional entertainment
[3:19:07] <$QueequegTheater> @WaifusSansFrontieres The difference is that we are shown morally good japanese characters as the norm, but noble foreigners are so rare in the series (Lee in 0, a couple characters in 4) that they're complete outliers

[3:31:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean, V can play up to the point of the LP

[3:32:02] <WaifusSansFrontieres> 14
[3:32:03] <fIashman92> @OblivionSword1 Woolie said 13 hours, so no
[3:32:03] <%Mattais88> If 13 sentinels didn't exist, it would be a shoe in for GOTY
[3:32:03] <Komayeda> So, is Woolie gonna like blast through all the yakoozies to get to this?
[3:32:04] <+GingerStrawhat> How many more sessions of Y7 you think there will be Woolz?
[3:32:06] <%livlinn> Please burn down Eyepatch one day

[3:32:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @DaRealLuderlappen
[3:32:08] <%CrazyMedicine> 14 games
[3:32:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> A definite tie between this and 13 Sentinels
[3:32:09] <%Jiggisnipe> @OblivionSword1 probably not, they want to do 13 hours. I think it's been like 9 ish
[3:32:09] <thesilverbard> this or 13 Sentinels
[3:32:11] <Asuterisuku> Isshin, Kenzan, Dead Souls, Kurohyo 1 and 2, Judgment.
[3:32:11] <emmmdeekay> another one
[3:32:14] <%guyalex> love to see that you guys are enjoying it so much and sharing it with a big new audiance
[3:32:14] <%Lion_kun> ALTERNATE WITH 0
[3:32:15] <%BusterRepukken> Have a talk with Eyepatch
[3:32:18] <andre11dr> 14 games i think
[3:32:18] <brachydios777> I would love a Kiryu Ichban team up
[3:32:22] <turbofolk> I dont understands why you forces us into emoticon mode after someone spilled the beans ITS SO USELESS Mods you think you are clever but you are noit
[3:32:22] <UvBenServed> It's fiiiiine
[3:32:23] <@Menitta> It's even a good change of pace after Judgment because the tone is so wildly different from even that
[3:32:23] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Alternate with 0
[3:32:24] <andre11dr> maybe 15
[3:32:27] <urkleturtle> and the jrpg style combat is only there because of a goof
[3:32:27] <WaifusSansFrontieres> judgment was 14 cause it has an ost called "Final Battle XIV"
[3:32:29] <Second_Omega> Eyepatch wolf needs a talking to
[3:32:30] <+GingerStrawhat> Boy does Eyepatch Wolf really hate this game
[3:32:31] <+loukemia83> Apropos of nothing TLOU2 is fuckkng GARBAGE
[3:32:31] <VidulaSaix> CAN MISSION IS DOPE
[3:32:33] <%Lion_kun> Not Eyepatch Wolf's LUL
[3:32:34] <%BlueJoneleth> How far will you go before going back to 0?
[3:32:35] <Torgue_1> Yep
[3:32:36] <%mikesapartment> you can play it on your own
[3:32:36] <@Solidus_113> you can do that forever

[3:33:12] <solracc25> Can money
[3:33:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> On the subject of Arakawa, I love when a DM lets your massive critical hit be nonlethal
[3:33:17] <+loukemia83> Ijincho is fucling HUGE compared to Kamurocho and Osaka
[3:33:17] <$QueequegTheater> Usually
[3:33:18] <Blank9> They usually have at least 2 cities
[3:33:20] <@Menitta> Its big but the amount of things in the map isn't too much more
[3:33:20] <SeruraRenge> Yakuza 5 has 4 cities
[3:33:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Not always but yes
[3:33:23] <@Solidus_113> It's almost always Osaka
[3:33:23] <%livlinn> gawd I wish I could visit Yokohama in peace woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:33:24] <Darren716> No
[3:33:24] <%nevermorecake> No

[3:33:28] <A0N33> Nope
[3:33:28] <%shad8snake> NO
[3:33:29] <%BusterRepukken> EyepatchWolf hates this because hes a Kiryu, beat em up fanboy.

[3:33:29] <+coinduck11> no
[3:33:29] <Zebroneath> no
[3:33:30] <CappuccinoGuil> no. Kiwami 2 has Osaka tho
[3:33:30] <quitebgamer> no
[3:33:31] <%Javaa01> Kiwami 1 is just Kamuro
[3:33:32] <rafflespaddock> starting with 2 they have
[3:33:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 2 onwards
[3:33:35] <mrdejesus34> Yes except for 1 and 4.
[3:33:35] <%Forente> NO First game
[3:33:35] <Namillus> Kiwami 1 is just Kamurocho
[3:33:35] <ghoststalker> No
[3:33:35] <Nero270> It varies game by game. 4 just has Kamurocho
[3:33:35] <OblivionSword1> kiwami 1 only kamuurocho
[3:33:36] <Darren716> 3 had 2, 4 had Kamurocho
[3:33:37] <dreamfillah> Yakuza 6 has a bunch of locations
[3:33:38] <engineboi> Yakuza 5 has 5 cities
[3:33:38] <DaRealLuderlappen> 0 2 3 5 6
[3:33:41] <%DkLordG> no
[3:33:41] <Darren716> 6 had 2
[3:33:41] <+GingerStrawhat> @brachydios777 With the direction it's going with the combat and gameplay he may be done with it, He's been talking about Y7 on Lets Fight a Boss
[3:33:42] <Asuterisuku> 3 has Okinawa
[3:33:45] <fIashman92> The whorephanage
[3:33:47] <brachydios777> Kiwami 2 has Sotsnbori
[3:33:48] <Carlioo> 5 has 4 locations
[3:33:49] <Blank9> 5 went nuts
[3:33:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Doesn't 6 have 3 locations?
[3:33:50] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus 1 has 1, 2 has 2, 3 has 2, 4 has 1, 5 had 4
[3:33:51] <$shaidot> 6 has hiroshima
[3:33:52] <+Ancopro> 1's the only one i think
[3:33:52] <+GingerStrawhat> He really likes Ichiban but hates the gameplay
[3:33:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Kiwami 2 has sotenbori
[3:33:55] <%Lion_kun> 5 has 4
[3:33:55] <VidulaSaix> 5 is a big, big game
[3:33:55] <turbofolk> boy i wish woolie would talk to eyepatch wolf about Yakuza after he campaigned super hard for Woolie to play it
[3:33:55] <%Grimlockfly> Reusing assets and all
[3:33:58] <Carlioo> oh yeah, 5 locations lol
[3:33:58] <fIashman92> 5 is too much
[3:33:59] <@Solidus_113> 5 and 6 have a couple
[3:34:00] <Tracazoid> Yakuza 4 is just Kamurocho, the rest have another location or 5 in 5's case
[3:34:05] <Nero270> 5 is ACTUALLY like a top 3 Yakuza game. It's amazing
[3:34:08] <$QueequegTheater> 1. Kamurocho 2. Osaka 3. Okinawa 5. Hatsune Miku town 6. Hiroshima
[3:34:08] <dinnydanny777> limesLurk
[3:34:14] <Blank9> Yeah, the other areas are real japanese locations.
[3:34:14] <majindusto> EYEPATCH WOLF HATES ON THIS GAME!!! BOooooo
[3:34:15] <andre11dr> 0 and 2 are Kamurocho and Osaka
[3:34:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> Not chat getting butthurt that someone doesn't like turn-based. Sad sight
[3:34:19] <Doctadaking> 5 has almost too much.
[3:34:19] <+skyheys> 5 is TOP BIG
[3:34:22] <engineboi> Yakuza 5 is too big
[3:34:26] <mrdejesus34> 2 has Osaka, 3 has Okinawa, 5 has Fukuoka, Sapporo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kamurocho, 6 was Onomichi.
[3:34:31] <engineboi> Took me 80 hours to beat
[3:34:35] <PsychoPearl> 5 is long
[3:34:35] <brachydios777> @gingerstrawhat I don’t get considering the story is great and he has said he likes this franchise
[3:34:38] <Blank9> it's 1-2 years usually
[3:34:42] <dork_doggler> e very two or three years
[3:34:43] <ghoststalker> @tracazoid 4 has a bit in another location as well
[3:34:44] <%Jiggisnipe> it's close for Japan
[3:34:47] <OblivionSword1> it's almost annual
[3:35:00] <%BusterRepukken> Aion i think
[3:35:07] <%wibbwobbler> y8 pls
[3:35:08] <brachydios777> Yakuza takes a bit now
[3:35:08] <+Infeirno23> @brachydios777 people dont like turnbased games
[3:35:09] <andre11dr> 5 was to long and those Haruka sections aren't the best
[3:35:10] <+MightyDuckShoes> the gameplay is a deal breaker. you either like it or don't and it's hard to ignore that element for the story
[3:35:18] <SeruraRenge> Kotor 1 runs worse on newer hardware
[3:35:26] <Nero270> 5 is a GOAT Yakuza entry. It's the culmination of the Yakuza arc in a way
[3:35:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:35:26] <+GingerStrawhat> @brachydios777 He loves the franchise but he was not really into Judgement and he has really not been in 7
[3:35:31] <brachydios777> @infeirno23 I see, kinda same thing with Dunkey
[3:35:47] <VidulaSaix> Ichiban is perfect I will hear nothing else on the matter
[3:35:47] <fIashman92> Middle aged adventures
[3:35:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Well that's why they also have Yagami who is the young guy really
[3:35:48] <UvBenServed> He's a child at heart, so it evens out...kinda
[3:35:48] <+king_of_beggars> YEAH, WHERE IS YAKUZA BABIES!?
[3:35:49] <mrdejesus34> Nagoshi doesn't like younger pretty boys.
[3:35:51] <%BusterRepukken> Dunkey purposefully makes RPGs look bad for videos though.
[3:35:52] <theyseemerowling> motivated
[3:35:53] <SeruraRenge> Diablo 2 is way, WAY buggier on W10 than it was on W7 and older
[3:35:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Kiryu’s a guy in his 60s!
[3:35:59] <theyseemerowling> MOTIVATED
[3:36:00] <%Jiggisnipe> clearly it doesn't matter cuz Kiryu was old too and he got 7 games
[3:36:00] <engineboi> Dude Tanimura got shafted hard
[3:36:01] <reonome> @king_of_beggars in kiwami 2
[3:36:07] <theyseemerowling> ! MOTIVATED
[3:36:11] <TheCrispyBoi> It's adult persona
[3:36:12] <engineboi> Only pretty boy young character doesn't return
[3:36:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Ichiban is 40 though
[3:36:16] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu is still in his 50s @mrathegreat
[3:36:17] <ghoststalker> RIP Tanimura getting screwed over
[3:36:17] <%shad8snake> yea isnt Kiryu in his 60s?
[3:36:21] <DaRealLuderlappen> Kiryu was 37 in 1
[3:36:24] <Blank9> Ichiban's older than Kiryu was by like, Yakuza 3 lol
[3:36:25] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu's in his 50s
[3:36:26] <fIashman92> You can be a Hero at 40
[3:36:27] <+king_of_beggars> @reonome ANd in this game, honestly.
[3:36:29] <+GingerStrawhat> He's 55 I think at the moment
[3:36:33] <DaRealLuderlappen> Late 50s now
[3:36:33] <theyseemerowling> !MOTIVATED
[3:36:33] <@Moobot> 2104 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:36:34] <engineboi> Kiryu should be 50 by now
[3:36:35] <%jinking79> Some Hit some Miss
[3:36:35] <QueenOfCuteCows> Ichiban is 42
[3:36:36] <%paladinstarbuster> Ichibans personality didnt change since he was 20
[3:36:38] <brachydios777> Kiryu is at Grandpa age
[3:36:41] <+GingerStrawhat> I think Kiryu is about 55
[3:36:42] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu is 50-51
[3:36:43] <ghoststalker> Kiryu is in his 50s, yeah
[3:36:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Kiryu was 20 in 1980s
[3:36:47] <majindusto> 4 you mean?
[3:36:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yakuza Like a Dragon is great because its Midlife Crisis: the RPG
[3:36:53] <%wibbwobbler> 42 yes LUL
[3:36:53] <+MajorCrasher> he's still low tier despite being old
[3:36:56] <Blank9> I love that the series takes place in real time, 0 excluded.
[3:36:57] <AstrodropGaming> Low survival rate
[3:36:59] <Namillus> Kiryu was 20 inYakuza 0
[3:37:00] <PsychoPearl> Majima would be 54 or 55
[3:37:01] <SeruraRenge> @majindusto I think he means Rikiya
[3:37:01] <TheCrispyBoi> 7 is the persona game i always wanted
[3:37:01] <%Deft_Thought> Deft_Thought subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Sup Woolie and V. Hope y'all and the Versus crew are doin all right.
[3:37:05] <fIashman92> @majindusto He's talkin about snake tatoo
[3:37:08] <CappuccinoGuil> I didn't know how much I needed Yakuza 7 in my life last year
[3:37:10] <%ThatMLPgamer> I wrote that before the lady showed up LUL
[3:37:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> SQX needs to take notes, yhou don't need to shove in VAAN's if you write Bosch's
[3:37:15] <mrdejesus34> PERSONA!
[3:37:16] <VidulaSaix> Boo
[3:37:17] <%Mattais88> It's why Papa Nier is so good
[3:37:19] <engineboi> Doesn't it blow your mind Haruka is 24 by now?
[3:37:20] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> and they look like human beings and not androgynous dolls
[3:37:22] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> LUL

[3:37:24] <+king_of_beggars> That's why I'm so excited for Returnal. I can't wait to play as a middle-aged woman.
[3:37:29] <brachydios777> r/HydroHomies
[3:37:31] <andre11dr> I can think of one in 2 that gets pretty high tier but nobody likes him
[3:37:32] <QueenOfCuteCows> Kiryu is 50
[3:37:34] <anarchistPastry> is that spelled Psy Defects
[3:37:36] <Nero270> What did Woolie and V think about the VA for JP?
[3:37:46] <majindusto> Ahhhh

[3:38:14] <fIashman92> @Nero270 At the very least, we know they liked Nick Ogata
[3:38:16] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus Yakuza 7 is Sega saying "there you got your persona with a non-teenage cast, now shut up"
[3:38:17] <Namillus> That quiet horrified realisation that Ichiban is in my age bracket
[3:38:28] <engineboi> Been playing these in JP so JP voices is my preference, the dub is really good tho.
[3:38:37] <Blank9> That scene was also in the very first trailer for the game.
[3:38:45] <QueenOfCuteCows> The ending MUST be listened to in English.
[3:38:47] <PsychoPearl> Cuz he ate gross rice mostly in prison
[3:38:47] <artoflec> is stream done? elaFeels
[3:38:49] <andre11dr> I played it sub so it's cool seeing the dub
[3:38:51] <+Deko_> time stops for a second when you bite
[3:38:51] <QueenOfCuteCows> Kaiji Tang acts his heart out
[3:38:55] <%livlinn> Japan's prison food is pretty solid. but you get very limited sweets
[3:38:58] <BlackermanZX> Both are so damn good
[3:38:59] <brachydios777> I keep forgetting Atlis is owned by Sega
[3:39:00] <CappuccinoGuil> They are so good, right?!
[3:39:03] <PsychoPearl> Which one you prefer?
[3:39:05] <VidulaSaix> Indeed
[3:39:06] <+Ancopro> it iiss
[3:39:08] <%osaka_daioh> its a hard choice man
[3:39:08] <%Jiggisnipe> it's a stupid battle
[3:39:08] <brachydios777> *Atlus
[3:39:11] <Chipshandon12> theres liek a 0.2 second delay for jokes and sad to land for me with sub
[3:39:15] <PsychoPearl> I like both
[3:39:15] <Asuterisuku> On the topic of butter, I'm pretty sure I have some of the Palmed stuff; it's been out a while and hasn't melted.
[3:39:15] <%wibbwobbler> fantastic
[3:39:18] <MiraLangsuir> Kaiji Tang is just... ugh, he's GREAT
[3:39:21] <restingbones> Yay, alternating ^^
[3:39:23] <engineboi> How many more streams can we expect?
[3:39:24] <+Deko_> WHAT
[3:39:25] <Karego_at> yea both are good thankfully, but it's still subs all the way
[3:39:25] <fIashman92> The side characters in JP are much more consistent
[3:39:28] <+MajorCrasher> he's way better in english
[3:39:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> If this is what RGG does with RPGs, I want them to make a Pokemon or Dragon Quest IV
[3:39:29] <QueenOfCuteCows> You HAVE to listen to the ending in English.
[3:39:31] <+scwry> Dub is Ray ChaSE
[3:39:33] <SeruraRenge> Nick in English is Ray Chase
[3:39:35] <PsychoPearl> He's better in Japanese
[3:39:35] <+Stoogeish> He's great in English
[3:39:36] <velgaduere> Ray Chase does a good job, but it's not sub Nick
[3:39:37] <VidulaSaix> It's even better LUL
[3:39:38] <Nero270> @QueenOfCuteCows The ending in the dub is great, but the ending in the sub has energy that just hit me like a truck personally
[3:39:39] <Darren716> They make them work in English too
[3:39:41] <Louie_Salmon> He's good in dub, but you can't beat that.
[3:39:42] <%livlinn> shiaLUL shiaLUL
[3:39:42] <brachydios777> I love English and Japanese Ichi equally
[3:39:42] <+rrratbastard> dub has some bonus points because their karaoke is so amateur-ish compared to sub, it's actually fun
[3:39:43] <mrdejesus34> Better than Yakuza 1's original dub.
[3:39:46] <ghoststalker> HWHAT
[3:39:47] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> Ray chase in dub
[3:39:47] <PsychoPearl> His Engrish is great
[3:39:48] <+Kuubyy> W H O A R E Y O U gentlemen?
[3:39:48] <@Menitta> I couldn't handle switching dub and sub with Judgment
[3:39:49] <Blank9> He's pretty good, but can't quite do the engrish.
[3:39:55] <restingbones> Is speaking english as a japanese person a joke?
[3:39:58] <%Jiggisnipe> Engrish is always great
[3:40:02] <Blank9> ???
[3:40:04] <restingbones> Or using english words?
[3:40:05] <artoflec> judgment's sub is way better, they botch almost every good scene in the dub
[3:40:05] <RetributionP> you forget that it's not a direct translation
[3:40:07] <Darren716> There's another character later on who speaks a bit of English and it's hilarious in the dub
[3:40:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Please continue this right away, alongside the rest of the series. No one wants to wait.
[3:40:08] <restingbones> I dont really get it
[3:40:09] <andre11dr> IS IT?
[3:40:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Fucked how? You get your stuff back
[3:40:13] <+Crippl3> the english dub is better for your party, but all the side characters are better in japanese
[3:40:16] <andre11dr> I don't understand that
[3:40:16] <red_fox_zero> Nick is better in Japanese. Ichiban is better in English.
[3:40:18] <solracc25> Nick is great in english too
[3:40:18] <Asuterisuku> @mrdejesus34 "Kill this arro-gant mo-ther-fuc-ker"
[3:40:23] <%osaka_daioh> doodShine
[3:40:32] <ghoststalker> Guess that dude never looked into his item box?
[3:40:39] <RICE02> Stop bragging getting f´d.
[3:40:45] <Asuterisuku> You know what it would be cool to see in more games? Voice acting preference per character.
[3:40:45] <SeruraRenge> I have issues with George Takei in the dub because while he's a good actor, half of his lines it sounds like it needed another take
[3:40:48] <GlaceonYo> Is like a dragon only wednesday for you/
[3:40:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Only one week left Woolie?
[3:40:48] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> jp is vastly superior
[3:40:53] <brachydios777> The cast is amazing in both, Barrett’s VA is in the English dub
[3:40:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mrdejesus34
[3:40:57] <reonome> hobocop
[3:40:58] <CappuccinoGuil> This is a game you could grind more easily than 0
[3:40:59] <Blank9> hobo, cop, hobocop
[3:41:00] <BlackermanZX> Hobo, cop, hobo
[3:41:00] <VidulaSaix> It hurts to know that we can't return to this unless Woolz and V decide to just watch the other games after 0 FeelsBadMan

[3:41:43] <%JustToWatch> Everyone watch guilty gear lore 10 times
[3:41:46] <mrdejesus34> This is the part where you're supposed to laugh. Laugh you stupid motherfucker. That is an actual line from the orignal Yakuza.
