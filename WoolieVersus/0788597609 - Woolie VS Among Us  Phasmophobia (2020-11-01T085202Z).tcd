[0:18:32] <%jinking79> fuck did i miss it
[0:18:32] <amiavamp> "Here kids, here's how to be a complete piece of trash."
[0:18:33] <%ChoculaUltra> there's a special place in hell for those people
[0:18:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S NOT THE KIDS, IT'S THE PARENTS
[0:18:39] <%derap41> Hey Woolie have you read about the flagellants and the Black Plauge. Trick or treaters are out flagellants today
[0:18:42] <RyuuAoi> Oh yes because kids are just gonna take one....
[0:18:43] <Agami23> the worst one is when the kid takes one and then the parent runs up and takes the rest.
[0:18:44] <%unclekulikov> *deep hurt unlocked*
[0:18:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK THOSE PARENTS
[0:18:45] <%ChoculaUltra> its always the parents
[0:18:45] <vintagecyborg> emptying it leaves a message
[0:18:46] <+TheRisingPride> oh, free bowl!
[0:18:47] <prime_name> Now that's just normal theft!
[0:18:48] <Ner234> That's next level
[0:18:49] <ValentineWolf7> It's a new form of low
[0:18:50] <happyface699> True garbage
[0:18:51] <+kidcoheed> taking the Container is worst
[0:18:52] <%deadredeyez> your bowl is mine
[0:18:53] <Agami23> because the kid is good, but the mom is the trash
[0:18:53] <el_patronn64> LUL
[0:18:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, those kids and parents need to trip and fall
[0:18:54] <$Superdandy96> The last time someone pulled a trick on my street the police was callled cause someone started a fire
[0:18:59] <anAngryHamster> There's a super crazy Korean lady at the grocery store I work at who hands out Chick tracts for tips.
[0:18:59] <+paladinstarbuster> Snooze you lose
[0:18:59] <happyface699> THE CONTAINER IS WORSE
[0:19:00] <spawnzie> I mean the container is just straight up stealing
[0:19:03] <%Livelinne> bitterUngo bitterUngo bitterUngo
[0:19:03] <phantalime> lol my friend stole a person's candy bowl back when we were like 10
[0:19:07] <happyface699> CAUSE WE BOUGHT IT
[0:19:07] <RyuuAoi> That could be your favorite container!
[0:19:09] <+DesertPenguin> If I saw that I would run after them
[0:19:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> emptying it and leaving the container
[0:19:10] <blairINtheUSA> I have stolen many bowls
[0:19:12] <%derap41> Modern Flagellants
[0:19:13] <+RetartJack> Here's how you combat that: you sit in a costume on your porch so you look like a stuffed dummy or something, if someone tries to break the rules you jump up screaming and snatch that shit back. pooSwag
[0:19:16] <Stormiercashew> GET IN THE VENT SHINJI
[0:19:16] <+TrevSmith222> They out there taking tires along with the candy.

[0:20:01] <+b_aleph> Unroolie Kenny?
[0:20:06] <%BinaryFireball> what you do is you set out the take 1 bowl but then hide so when they try to take the whole thing you scare the shit out of them

[0:46:18] <alien314> He could see when it was dark
[0:46:18] <zipperdude33> THE DOKAGE STRIKES
[0:46:21] <RyuShinden> Minh panicked and gave it away
[0:46:21] <Louie_Salmon> Does Woolie know the tech of having everyone deafen on discord so ghosts can chat?
[0:46:23] <+jiggy_snipe> that hallway kill was crazy
[0:46:24] <BusterRepukken> words that kill
[0:46:24] <+JustToWatch> what's the point of ghosts doing tasks?
[0:46:27] <pjbuster> rip reggie
[0:46:31] <+mechslayer71> MINH LOST BUT STILL WON
[0:46:33] <ValentineWolf7> Immediately
[0:46:33] <ZComiX> Just so you know you can cancel a vote woolie by clicking on the person again
[0:46:34] <MBDiana1> Minh with those big tier moves
[0:46:35] <%RyTYoung> BibleThump
[0:46:38] <NevikGamina> LUL
[0:46:39] <Louie_Salmon> @justtowatch All tasks done = crew win
[0:46:41] <+CharredChord> Minh should NOT have come back
[0:46:43] <ValentineWolf7> The level of distrust was UNREAL
[0:46:44] <JonnyZeFox> don't super into neutral, don't vote early HahaThink
[0:46:45] <+ChestMimik> @justtowatch Town wins when all tasks are done
[0:46:45] <Namillus> @JustToWatch "all tasks done" is a win timer
[0:46:51] <+JustToWatch> got it
[0:46:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @ZComiX wait, for real?
[0:46:53] <munitalprats> Minh doesnt like lying
[0:46:55] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL Minh
[0:46:56] <BusterRepukken> lool
[0:46:59] <Overloard> should put more time on discussion so you cant vote before stories are heard
[0:47:00] <%ClericOfSparda> Nice he got you good tho
[0:47:01] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:47:01] <+LynbellDaYo> whoa, i didn't know you could cancel votes
[0:47:01] <%spookler> ajsDoc
[0:47:02] <RyuShinden> Minh buckled LUL
[0:47:03] <%wah_ha_ha> why you guys didn't tie the vote to save woolie, jeez
[0:47:03] <WritebroAlpha> @WoolieVersus you need to do tasks, mang. The faster you do tasks, the more pressure on Imposer
[0:47:05] <Thunderhog> It doesnt help that half the people dont understand some of the basic mechancis, so lying gets more confusing here.
[0:47:06] <dots4eyes> Minh also voted super fast
[0:47:06] <iosephe> All minh can do is kill
[0:47:07] <%ClericOfSparda> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[0:47:07] <andre11dr> I was sus of Punchmom because she wasn't saying shit
[0:47:20] <%ClericOfSparda> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieMINHMAX woolieYE
[0:47:27] <$Superdandy96> Punchmom needs to talk more, I thought it was her at first lol
[0:47:29] <Smitteys867> How did Minh win that round with 2 other survivors left?
[0:47:31] <pjbuster> Minh really lost but won
[0:47:33] <irfan_> minh was lucky V was convinced
[0:47:33] <%brickwall35> punchmom didn't have anything to say, she was never near a body
[0:47:35] <%SilverDevilfish> woolieMINHMAX wooliePOYO woolieKICKDAD
[0:47:35] <+jiggy_snipe> that hallway kill would have been baller if he had the story
[0:47:38] <+paladinstarbuster> mihn is handicapped because of his accent
[0:47:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Smitteys867 he klled someone else
[0:47:49] <Overloard> try less vote time mor discuss time
[0:47:51] <Psyramics> @Smitteys867 killed someone and the game is over when imposters = crewmembers
[0:47:55] <DopeyDragon> that's fair
[0:47:58] <Smitteys867> Ah
[0:48:07] <munitalprats> idk
[0:48:13] <Broken_Sonex> Minh's struggle with English will NOT help him here LUL

[0:48:20] <munitalprats> I feel like imposters are at a huge disadvantage if kill time is so high
[0:48:28] <Sydin18> ghosts can talk to each other
[0:48:31] <Rixstarian> 30/90 is ok
[0:48:32] <pjbuster> reggie is gonna slaughter when he's actually a imposter
[0:48:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Alright, now let's remove Confirm Ejects Kappa
[0:48:40] <RyuShinden> Also, deafen on Discord so you can talk to each other
[0:48:41] <+kewlmyc> lol, no wonder the killers kept winning
[0:48:44] <NotHereToStream> you can't but you can pretend to do task
[0:48:45] <+LynbellDaYo> imposter won two times in a row, i think they're fine
[0:48:53] <Louie_Salmon> @munitalprats This is actually a very low kill timer, 25 or 30 is more common
[0:48:57] <Smitteys867> Turn the voting time down, make it more tense
[0:48:58] <Ids560> as impostor you get a bunch of fake chores to pretend to do
[0:48:59] <DopeyDragon> You have to pretend if you're an imposter
[0:48:59] <WritebroAlpha> @WoolieVersus speedrun your tasks
[0:49:07] <whimsicallifestyle> discussion time has no vote allowed
[0:49:12] <RyuuAoi> We know, Minh
[0:49:16] <+toastybites> the "confirm ejections" setting also takes away tons of tension
[0:49:24] <CappuccinoGuil> toggle "Confirm Ejections" off now
[0:49:24] <NotHereToStream> weapons and scan have visual
[0:49:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYE
[0:49:31] <%brickwall35> @ids560 you can fake any task. the list isnt really helpful
[0:49:31] <WritebroAlpha> Turning off "confirm ejects" is great imo
[0:49:31] <iosephe> It doesn't matter if Confirm Ejections is on, there's only one imposter
[0:49:40] <amiavamp> Does confirm ejections matter with only 1 imposter?
[0:49:45] <Overloard> confirm ejections is only relevant for 2 imposters
[0:49:46] <+jiggy_snipe> there's only 1 imposter so confirms don't matter
[0:49:47] <DopeyDragon> @WritebroAlpha no point in 1 imp games
[0:49:51] <RyuShinden> Kenny??? doodKen
[0:49:51] <+Caped_Eggy> Up the kill cooldown maybe?
[0:49:52] <+LynbellDaYo> kennyyyy
[0:49:54] <+ChestMimik> @amiavamp Not at all
[0:49:54] <%brickwall35> @writebroalpha doesn't matter with 1 imposter
[0:49:56] <CappuccinoGuil> @jiggy_snipe oh true
[0:50:00] <Ids560> yeah but if you fake a common task that no one else has they can call you on it
[0:50:00] <Explodincatz> tanks can overlap
[0:50:01] <WritebroAlpha> MedBay scan, asteroids, shields and rubbish chute are visual gtasks IIRC
[0:50:01] <RyuShinden> OH SHIT KENNY WILL JOIN?? doodKen
[0:50:04] <+b_aleph> 5 times?
[0:50:08] <%ClericOfSparda> C'mon, crewmates!
[0:50:09] <whimsicallifestyle> @amiavamp id say the tension is still better with it off
[0:50:10] <Solidnick18> kenny omega PogChamp
[0:50:19] <+kewlmyc> @WritebroAlpha Turning off "confirm ejects" is pointless with just one imposter.
[0:50:19] <%SuperKirby24> oh shit, all of the versus crew PogChamp
[0:50:21] <%brickwall35> @ids560 that's correct but they are too new to get that
[0:50:23] <%thechungiestofbois> If doodKen says Bro he is the imposter
[0:50:29] <Ids560> fair enough
[0:50:30] <Illithid72> Turn off confirm ejects!
[0:50:36] <Cjsquid> woolieSHOOK
[0:50:37] <+ChestMimik> I think it's possible to turn of vote visibility too
[0:50:37] <WritebroAlpha> @kewlmyc true, but just in general I prefer to have it off in my games
[0:50:38] <%ekodrop> if you're in the waiting room too long it'll kick all of you
[0:50:40] <haisho> so customizable that it can be turned into hide and seek
[0:50:41] <%ClericOfSparda> I like when it doesn't confirm who the imposter is
[0:50:44] <munitalprats> Its useless for you
[0:50:45] <%brickwall35> @illithid72 it literally has no effect with 1 imposter
[0:50:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @Illithid72 with 1 impostor, it doesn't matter, crew wins automatically if they get it right
[0:50:59] <+Metballs> It does literally nothing here
[0:50:59] <zamzoph> turn it off for the drama!
[0:51:02] <Illithid72> @brickwall35 I didn't realize there was only one. My bad
[0:51:08] <RyuShinden> Confirm ejects off is hard mode
[0:51:12] <%brickwall35> @illithid72 it's cool!
[0:51:15] <haisho> turn it off so people go OH FUCK when they get it wrong
[0:51:26] <BLG24> why is regi face there?
[0:51:27] <olaksi> No-confirms is good once people get the hang of it
[0:51:27] <%ClericOfSparda> Woolie is NOT going to survive
[0:51:34] <+LynbellDaYo> Turning it off doesn't matter 'cause you would know from the fact that the game didn't just end
[0:51:34] <SomersaultJustice> why does woolie have a little baby woolie following him
[0:51:34] <%Livelinne> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE

[0:53:46] <Illithid72> Ask about reactor also Woolie
[0:53:46] <%Mordexai0> Sloooooooooooow Woolie is Sloooooooooooow
[0:53:47] <whimsicallifestyle> only oxygen and nuclear can kill
[0:53:48] <DopeyDragon> It's okay, we learning
[0:53:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie has become too dependent on the cube
[0:53:50] <munitalprats> Woolie with the dragon install
[0:53:50] <pjbuster> reggie said keikaku time
[0:53:53] <cheapdoc> It wasn't the numbers, there was a counter
[0:54:09] <cheapdoc> there's a 30 second count down
[0:54:09] <%ClericOfSparda> Reggie Sabotaged the reactor

[0:54:34] <pjbuster> reggie really pulled a frieza and said he needed no oxygen
[0:54:35] <munitalprats> 30
[0:54:39] <RyuShinden> thirty seconds I think
[0:54:40] <Broken_Sonex> SLOW IN GAME AND SLOW IRL
[0:54:45] <Illithid72> There is also lights and doors.
[0:54:45] <RyuuAoi> woolieLORE
[0:54:46] <Davo46> punchmom too loud
[0:54:47] <NotHereToStream> there is a timer in the task
[0:54:49] <cheapdoc> There is a blinking yellow arrow ...
[0:54:51] <@Solidus_113> it shows up in the task list
[0:54:51] <Broken_Sonex> THE WOOLIE WAY
[0:54:52] <@Solidus_113> flashing
[0:55:08] <%Skullgod> get mothman
[0:55:09] <+ChestMimik> Reactor and O2 both have alarms the rsst don't
[0:55:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> btw
[0:55:18] <NotHereToStream> i believe emergency button can negate the sabotage, i think
[0:55:18] <haisho> if the alarm is ringing, then it means you need to go
[0:55:19] <RyuShinden> Lights out is a sabotage
[0:55:19] <Ids560> all sabotages stop the emergency meeting button
[0:55:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can totally time a kill with lag to kill someone after a body is reported
[0:55:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Bro, imagine if there was a sabotage that destroyed a room and killed anyone in it
[0:55:26] <%RioGascar> Comms and lights be “ignored” but reactor and oxygen are do it or die
[0:55:30] <DigitalJoshie> lights out and comms outage are sabotage
[0:55:30] <Ner234> Imposters have night vision right?
[0:55:33] <NotHereToStream> oh
[0:55:35] <DedlokPM> no indicator
[0:55:40] <@Solidus_113> the indicator is you stopped moving
[0:55:43] <+ChestMimik> @ner234 correct
[0:55:45] <dots4eyes> It's sus tho
[0:55:46] <DigitalJoshie> you can report a dead body
[0:55:48] <%brickwall35> @ner234 the lights stay on for imposter
[0:55:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imposters can see in the dark
[0:55:49] <zocano> But you *can* report a body
[0:55:51] <Enigmatic_Voidling> Hi @DedlokPM teenHEY
[0:55:53] <@Solidus_113> not moving is sus
[0:55:55] <PettyFunk> It’s pretty rare to lose by O2 running out afaik, it’s most often used to draw players to one side of the map
[0:55:57] <DopeyDragon> @WoolieVersus Reporting bodies ends a sabotage
[0:55:58] <+CharredChord> you can run while sabotage menu is open too
[0:55:58] <Overloard> just that you stopped moving
[0:56:06] <DedlokPM> @Solidus_113 that tell only works on people not able to multi-task. rooVV
[0:56:07] <+ChestMimik> also reporting a body cancels all sabotage
[0:56:10] <%SirGO0SE> FREE he said
[0:56:11] <DedlokPM> @Enigmatic_Voidling teenHEY
[0:56:16] <%SuperKirby24> we learnin LUL
[0:56:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @WritebroAlpha
[0:56:18] <RyuShinden> @PettyFunk Sabotage wins are quite rare
[0:56:23] <Overloard> alot of first timers forget you can move in menu
[0:56:28] <Namillus> @ChestMimik Cancels all CRITICAL sabotage, lights and comms stay down
[0:56:29] <WritebroAlpha> You CAN report bodies and it ends the sabotage
[0:56:30] <Illithid72> *doesn't know a mechanic at all* Free win!
[0:56:32] <andre11dr> You can cover sabotage by doing it where there's a task
[0:56:33] <ValentineWolf7> 3 people left with 1 being the imposter, then just spam the reactor to stop the sus button.
[0:56:35] <DedlokPM> @Solidus_113 because it is possible to sabo and move at the same time

[1:01:20] <whimsicallifestyle> he probably thought he count report cause hes the imposter
[1:01:21] <+jiggy_snipe> vote out Woolie
[1:01:21] <Enigmatic_Voidling> I think everyone is pretty green tho, right?
[1:01:24] <whimsicallifestyle> *couldnt
[1:01:28] <pjbuster> i still think minh is the imposter
[1:01:30] <DedlokPM> Minh killed himself to divert suspicion. rooVV
[1:01:31] <andre11dr> I don't know guys, it could be Woolie Kappa
[1:01:34] <+CharredChord> it's either Punchmom or Reggie is an idiot
[1:01:36] <RyuuAoi> I think V and Punch are clear
[1:01:36] <PettyFunk> Did Reggie really not see the big report button turn on?
[1:01:37] <Illithid72> What cooldown are they using?
[1:01:37] <+mechslayer71> Yeah they’re all pretty new
[1:01:38] <Overloard> v is the watcher
[1:01:41] <+ChestMimik> It's totally Pat
[1:01:43] <+toastybites> @Enigmatic_Voidling yeah but Woolie has experience as Chief Liar
[1:01:44] <+barristerofthebar> Pmom?
[1:01:46] <RyuShinden> @DedlokPM Minh pulling off the Aizen play? Kappa
[1:01:46] <DianaTheAscian> Its clearly Minh guys
[1:01:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Electrical is the biggest death trap in the game
[1:01:48] <Equirah> Jill is quiet
[1:01:48] <DopeyDragon> Punch is definitely clear
[1:01:48] <ValentineWolf7> Imposter suicide. What a play.
[1:01:52] <%ClericOfSparda> I love when people still don't know the rules
[1:01:53] <Solidnick18> the yomi is real
[1:01:55] <RyuuAoi> It's Minh
[1:01:57] <DedlokPM> @RyuShinden Exactly
[1:02:02] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie betrays his wife again Kappa
[1:02:03] <RyuShinden> We all know Minh is doing the Aizen play Kappa
[1:02:09] <+mechslayer71> We saw Reggie with Minh tho
[1:02:09] <+jiggy_snipe> ^
[1:02:10] <Enigmatic_Voidling> @Enigmatic_Voidling Oh, yeah of course. I'm just saying, besides that, everyone is fairly new
[1:02:11] <Broken_Sonex> PUNCHMOM IS SUS
[1:02:11] <munitalprats> ask punch mom to follow you
[1:02:18] <+Caped_Eggy> Woolie is so ready to eject punchmom
[1:02:29] <dots4eyes> She took out the trash...aka Minh Kappa
[1:02:30] <munitalprats> If she's got no tasks she should be able to follow you
[1:02:32] <Illithid72> Woolie doesn't read chat during game right? I hope he isn't.
[1:02:32] <Overloard> pro gamers finsih tasks after first button
[1:02:35] <ValentineWolf7> Oh no not Punchmom!
[1:02:37] <AlidLCastle> Punchmom sus
[1:02:39] <NevikGamina> PUNCHMOM SUS
[1:02:41] <Davo46> i cant see mihn leaving reggie

[1:02:59] <Enigmatic_Voidling> teenSUS
[1:03:02] <Make_me_mad> I think it's V.
[1:03:03] <SomersaultJustice> it's little v. I base this on nothing
[1:03:05] <ValentineWolf7> Vote Minh AGAIN
[1:03:06] <munitalprats> i dont think its reggie at all
[1:03:08] <Davo46> FOLLOW V AND REGGIE WOOLIE
[1:03:10] <+jiggy_snipe> I imagine Reggie running and yelling omg omg omg
[1:03:11] <+mechslayer71> Self reports are a thing
[1:03:13] <Louie_Salmon> The button hit makes me less sus of Reggie honestly
[1:03:13] <andre11dr> I don't know Minhs corpse was pretty sus
[1:03:23] <ShadowSpratan7> 100% reggie
[1:03:25] <+ChestMimik> It's V, I said it at the start of the round and my gut hasn't changed it's mind
[1:03:26] <Meltgar> Woolie the chef with the child, What's the child name?
[1:03:26] <%Cozy90> who on the ship decided you can only hit the button once
[1:03:27] <+LynbellDaYo> big murders going on rn
[1:03:29] <RyuuAoi> V and Punch are clear

[1:07:31] <+barristerofthebar> He went for it
[1:07:33] <amiavamp> Reggie going for the 4d chess bluff
[1:07:36] <DigitalJoshie> woolie that is a strat tho
[1:07:39] <pjbuster> reggie almost had it the 2nd time
[1:07:40] <whimsicallifestyle> killed him right in front of his girl!!!!!!
[1:07:40] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> woolieKICKDAD woolieACCIDENT woolieONEGUY
[1:07:40] <NotHereToStream> kill, selfreport and blame it on somebody else
[1:07:41] <Overloard> he was going for a combo
[1:07:43] <ValentineWolf7> Woolie almost had it
[1:07:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> HE TRIED IT OMEGALUL
[1:07:46] <+VoytekBus> killing is hard
[1:07:46] <NotHereToStream> usually when you want 3 left
[1:07:47] <RyuuAoi> woolieOMG
[1:07:52] <AlidLCastle> I have trouble killing too buddy
[1:07:56] <DopeyDragon> Is Reggie on mobile??
[1:07:56] <+CharredChord> Killing in storage is a death sentence
[1:07:57] <ValentineWolf7> Reggie almost came out on top
[1:07:58] <nivlac_555> that was good
[1:07:59] <DigitalJoshie> you kill that person then blame it on the other
[1:07:59] <Thunderhog> Killing in front of someone is a real tactic if you can blame it on the other person woolie, but it doesnt work on 4 people
[1:08:00] <munitalprats> its reggies pure heart
[1:08:04] <MBDiana1> "killing is hard for me" thats good reggie, it means youre still somewhat human
[1:08:04] <+jiggy_snipe> if Reggie got away with this lol

[1:08:26] <Thunderhog> Killing infront of someone works if theres gonna be 3 people left and the 3rd person doesnt see the death. It's a 50/50 on the person who wasnt tehre
[1:08:28] <DopeyDragon> @WoolieVersus Tab opens map btw
[1:08:33] <+mechslayer71> He threw at the very end

[1:09:31] <RyuuAoi> Wow Woolie! The bathroom is woolieGIRLS
[1:09:31] <Psyramics> it's weird, cause Imposters can report bodies normally
[1:09:35] <@Solidus_113> omni brain play
[1:09:40] <+jiggy_snipe> 4d chess self report
[1:09:44] <dots4eyes> Crewmates ran it back on the punish
[1:09:46] <%thechungiestofbois> galaxy brain plays from Reggie
[1:09:47] <Dementedpenguin> Reggie killing it and selling it.
[1:09:48] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[1:09:53] <Namillus> @Psyramics But reporting clears bodies, so the Impostor can just lie about where the body was
[1:09:54] <haisho> you can hit the button to remove the body from the map, but nobody really does it
[1:10:04] <Broken_Sonex> PRAY that Reggie does not get better LUL
[1:10:12] <ValentineWolf7> Reggie with the swerve
[1:10:20] <Louie_Salmon> @woolieversus Do you guys know the deafen tech? If everyone deafens then you can talk, and ghosts can stay undeafened to talk to each other.
[1:10:25] <FiendishlyInventive> Next time invite Pat and Paige to make it legendary.
[1:10:28] <haisho> usually self-reporting works but people get sus
[1:10:32] <%Livelinne> Reggie is too pure for this :(
[1:10:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HI V
[1:10:41] <+jiggy_snipe> Is Reggie a better liar than Woolie? WutFace
[1:10:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey v, you smell like the game
[1:10:44] <Psyramics> @Namillus yeah, but that's not the issue. Reggie's story about running back to the button doesn't matter cause he could've struggled to report as both Crewmate and Imposter
[1:10:44] <%JustYudha> Oh I thought Woolie and Reggie was getting into the bathroom together lol
[1:10:44] <%Cozy90> something tells me pat would rage so hard at this game

[1:18:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> THE DEAD CAN'T TALK...to the living
[1:18:26] <andre11dr> They are adding more maps right?

[1:18:33] <+b_aleph> @RyuShinden yeyeyey
[1:18:35] <Louie_Salmon> You could just deafen and let ghosts talk
[1:18:42] <+CSNG> The music sounds like The Thing soundtrack
[1:18:45] <pjbuster> unroolie x woolie x tekken
[1:18:47] <+WorldsBestPanda> You can talk to us, Woolie. : )
[1:18:50] <yash_lawman> @ryushinden you know it
[1:18:52] <Hzealot> @WoolieVersus if you all deafen on discord you can just have the dead people not deafen and talk in there
[1:18:59] <ValentineWolf7> The dead remain hidden. AS THEY SHOULD
[1:19:03] <Hzealot> nvm
[1:19:06] <Namillus> The vents in Mira link up to form a ring, but the sensors are SUPER STRONG if you figure out how to read them
[1:19:08] <Louie_Salmon> Oooooh right
[1:19:09] <munitalprats> just make it text
[1:19:15] <%ClericOfSparda> You chat with the dead in order to find out who the second imposter is
[1:19:19] <%ClericOfSparda> And to pass the time
[1:19:21] <Ids560> I do hate when the dead speak
[1:19:29] <+ChestMimik> @clericofsparda they're only doing one imposter
[1:19:31] <cheapdoc> The dead speak
[1:19:32] <%ekodrop> OH THAT'S WHY REGGIE'S HEAD IS THERE
[1:19:34] <Louie_Salmon> I guess talking is a no-go with some people being local
[1:19:37] <%SuperKirby24> don't you hate it when the dead people speak to you DansGame
[1:19:42] <+Proxzo> heyhey
[1:19:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> hearing V say bud gives me some HARD minnesotan farmer vibes
[1:19:48] <%ekodrop> gotta restart
[1:19:48] <andre11dr> They did say they dropped Among Us 2 to keep working on this, so i imagine they'll add more maps
[1:19:50] <%doomerskeletor13> V is sus

[1:20:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Minnesotan are discount Canadians so it's cool
[1:20:34] <+LucianLiminal> as a minnesotan we share a lot with canada
[1:20:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:20:35] <+RealThiele> bless your heart
[1:20:37] <+Proxzo> I feel like Bonds Will Be Broken
[1:20:39] <+WorldsBestPanda> Definitely not a Canadian impostor.
[1:20:43] <MisterArcanine> The next update theyre adding anonymous voting and task bar completion only goes off in meetings
[1:20:44] <ValentineWolf7> I heard there was a VR Chat version of this game
[1:20:47] <%ekodrop> budweiser is american
[1:20:47] <%ClericOfSparda> What is this, Letterkenny?
[1:20:50] <+MadPretty> Is woolie Vile?
[1:20:56] <RyuShinden> @WoolieVersus You can check your map to beeline to your tasks
[1:20:57] <pjbuster> that's hilariously dark
[1:20:58] <%thechungiestofbois> Woolie JR becomes Batman
[1:21:02] <Equirah> that's what happens in real life too
[1:21:09] <NeakGX> it shows the play time below the stream next to the viewer count now
[1:21:11] <Equirah> your son is left behind LUL
[1:21:12] <%SaiyanShoto> He stays there waiting for his dad to wake up
[1:21:15] <Dhurkst> better than the son dying too!
[1:21:16] <%notgarza> lytWHAT
[1:21:18] <reonome> yes
[1:21:20] <SpaceGuntank> you should see it with the dog pet, its 1000x worse
[1:21:20] <+RealThiele> guess we better kill the women and children too
[1:21:21] <+ChestMimik> Sort of, they just explode
[1:21:21] <munitalprats> theres no animation really
[1:21:21] <%ChoculaUltra> or they become a Dexter, doomed to hunt Impostors as the Impostor Impostor Killer.
[1:21:22] <munitalprats> he jusdt dies
[1:21:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> not the animation but you see the dude just die
[1:21:25] <munitalprats> they explode
[1:21:27] <NotHereToStream> right, beware of stacked kills too
[1:21:36] <ValentineWolf7> No. The animation only animates between killer and killee.
[1:21:36] <CurrySauseBandit> They only have 6 people. Rough
[1:21:40] <+ChestMimik> The killer snaps to the body too though so it's not subtle
[1:21:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you just see their head pop and then they fall
[1:21:42] <JonnyZeFox> Remember, son, if you're ever lost stay where you are and I'll find you :)
[1:21:53] <munitalprats> the killer teleports to the body and the victim explodes
[1:21:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @JonnyZeFox NotLikeThis
[1:21:55] <munitalprats> pretty much
[1:22:00] <+Proxzo> Will this VOD get uploaded to youtube? I missed an hour and a half.
[1:22:08] <+LazyAss24Seven> cooldown pauses when in vents
[1:22:12] <%ClericOfSparda> It would be cool if there was an animation where the person gets sliced in half and the top half disintigrates
[1:22:13] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Keyboard Shortcuts: Q = kill R = report E = everything else
[1:22:30] <+b_aleph> @Proxzo ye, but you'll lose Minh's porno story

[1:40:08] <+wydamn> Woolie did make the right choice by saving V for the final vote, he just botched it at the end

[1:43:59] <DianaTheAscian> Minh droped it
[1:43:59] <+LynbellDaYo> V with another clean win
[1:43:59] <Ner234> V WAS sus
[1:44:02] <+ChestMimik> What just happened
[1:44:02] <+waltzqueen> LUL
[1:44:05] <JonnyZeFox> pulled a Reggie LUL
[1:44:06] <%Irridium> bodied
[1:44:07] <happyface699> BLOOD IS SPILT
[1:44:08] <anAngryHamster> He's the gun member, of the coconut crew
[1:44:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Oh, comms were down
[1:44:13] <+condemned_15> RIPeroni in pepperoni
[1:44:15] <+ChestMimik> You can't call during sabotage
[1:44:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> emergency
[1:44:16] <RajidaViper> LUL LUL LUL
[1:44:16] <pjbuster> V with the 2-0
[1:44:17] <+Baekon01> during a sabotage you cant call a meeting
[1:44:18] <+steelmorrigan> You can't When comms is sabotaged
[1:44:19] <%StaceMcGate> CAN'T CALL MEETING DURING EMERGENCY
[1:44:20] <Equirah> Coms were down
[1:44:20] <+wolf34736> you can't when there is an emergency
[1:44:21] <+aishman> No there was an emergency
[1:44:21] <andre11dr> coms were done
[1:44:22] <President_valentine> the button takes time
[1:44:24] <+kewlmyc> Coms down
[1:44:24] <+jiggy_snipe> comms were sabotaged
[1:44:25] <edward11231> Don’t vote on 4
[1:44:25] <RyeBreadBakery> V SUS
[1:44:29] <MisterArcanine> You never wanna vote on 4 with one imposter left and you never wanna vote on 7 with two imposters left
[1:44:31] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Meeting buttons disabled by comms
[1:44:32] <pjbuster> wait no, v lost once
[1:44:34] <Touchofweeb> Can't if there's a sabotage
[1:44:35] <Louie_Salmon> Any emergency stops the button
[1:44:37] <ValentineWolf7> Best play is to sabotage to stop any escape.
[1:44:37] <yash_lawman> V sus.
[1:44:44] <+ChestMimik> there's also a cooldown a few seconds but comms down is what happened then
[1:44:52] <%DreyfussFrost> You can't immediately call emergencies, even without a sabotage. Look at the options: "Emergency Cooldown"
[1:44:56] <donaghy> @WoolieVersus Emergency cooldown of 15 seconds when the round starts
[1:45:11] <yash_lawman> lmao. I NEVER FREEZE.
[1:45:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> couldn't have, kill cooldown is 20
[1:45:28] <ValentineWolf7> Call 911 has a cooldown.
[1:45:28] <%Creggamonsta> just report the kills
[1:45:34] <Touchofweeb> Need to increase the kill cooldown to avoid that
[1:45:38] <marumiyan1> is woolie playing with mnb?
[1:45:41] <WritebroAlpha> If it were me, I would have simply reported the body
[1:45:45] <andre11dr> I actually can't wait to see what happens when Punchmom gets killer
[1:45:59] <andre11dr> she's so random
[1:46:07] <+Purple_Shirt> I'm late. How have the games been so far?
[1:46:14] <+ChestMimik> This is all a ploy that will pay iff when she's killer
[1:46:14] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah they weren't staring, they were all doing it
[1:46:23] <RyuShinden> Yeah some tasks are twio factor
[1:46:27] <amiavamp> @Purple_Shirt Reggie is an A-list actor
[1:46:28] <%DemonOfSalt> @Purple_Shirt Woolie pulled an Aizen on everyone first match.
[1:46:28] <Monkeyweed21> V has come to @Purple_Shirt
[1:46:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> kill cooldown is 5 sec longer than emergency cooldown, so if you call a sabotage with like 6 sec on kill cooldown you stop meetings
[1:46:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Punchmom is gonna win cuz of her lack of knowledge of game lol
[1:46:41] <%Mordexai0> Minh jumped the gun
[1:46:47] <Touchofweeb> Kill cooldown needs increasing
[1:46:48] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:46:49] <+Baekon01> reggie cant say anything
[1:47:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait, for real tho does reggie know how to report a body?
[1:47:05] <ValentineWolf7> All according to keikaku
[1:47:06] <+Purple_Shirt> Thanks, I'll have to check out the anime once it gets released. Sounds hilarious
[1:47:08] <WritebroAlpha> @WoolieVersus You need to INCREASE the KILL COOLDOWN to 30a
[1:47:24] <NotHereToStream> polus is even harder
[1:47:30] <%ekodrop> no
[1:47:36] <DedlokPM> rooYes
[1:47:36] <+jiggy_snipe> massacres are funny tho lol
[1:47:38] <amiavamp> Need Ivy to make rushdown obsolete
[1:47:40] <yash_lawman> LMAO Polus is soooooo big
[1:47:40] <OldManDeckardCain> v is fed
[1:47:41] <+Zyquux> 20s is way too short for only 6 people
[1:47:42] <VidulaSaix> 25s tends to be the standard
[1:47:42] <Explodincatz> just get good
[1:47:55] <yash_lawman> lol
[1:47:56] <%ClericOfSparda> Add a second short task
[1:48:00] <JonnyZeFox> the map is also new to everyone

[1:49:18] <Equirah> mouse at the ready LUL

[1:49:22] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh survived last time some how
[1:49:22] <+wydamn> @ChestMimik this
[1:49:24] <%ClericOfSparda> They should all follow minh to make sure he is not murdered, then he'll get frustrated because he's the killer and it would be obv if he killed them
[1:49:24] <ValentineWolf7> If it's not Minh then it's Minh
[1:49:31] <%chosenjuan42> don't die
[1:49:34] <Louie_Salmon> I would vote woolie just based on his walking
[1:49:36] <amiavamp> @nintega010 The Mafia custom map for Starcraft 2 was a pretty good rendition of this type of game as well
[1:49:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> uh rip coms

[1:52:35] <+LynbellDaYo> Woolie's bizarre logic is now validated
[1:52:36] <pjbuster> woolie really out killing reggie
[1:52:36] <Make_me_mad> Woolie ANYONE could know about the wallet because anyone can have done that task in a previous round
[1:52:37] <iosephe> That logic was bad but

[1:52:37] <+Purple_Shirt> That self-reporting FOOL
[1:52:38] <%TheBensonator_> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD

[1:52:48] <anAngryHamster> Woolie you fucked up and won anyway
[1:52:48] <+wydamn> lol
[1:52:52] <amiavamp> The gang needs some glasses
[1:52:53] <%ClericOfSparda> Reggie has bad luck. This game's picking him and V over and over
[1:52:53] <Vaun0x> TRASH LOGIC THOO
[1:52:54] <+jiggy_snipe> Lady V messed up again apparently LUL
[1:52:55] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:52:56] <Smitteys867> How is woolie
[1:52:58] <NotHereToStream> we need a full lobby
[1:53:00] <DedlokPM> @jiggy_snipe because everyone is new to the game and we really have not had enough time to do tasks each time so it is a reasonable line of thought
[1:53:00] <dots4eyes> Woolie bumbles his way to a W
[1:53:01] <ValentineWolf7> Her fight or flight is too strong
[1:53:04] <KnivesEve> jill is the 2nd imposter
[1:53:04] <+Orenjevel> that was a SWINGY way to decide, who knows if punch mom's been playing this off-stream
[1:53:09] <yash_lawman> I thing woolies logic is good
[1:53:09] <+ChestMimik> Woolie hit them with the raw level 3 super in the wrong direction
[1:53:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie's logic is good for now because he knows everyone except jill doesn't really know tasks unless you just did it
[1:53:13] <nauticalgypsy> they all suck so much at this its so damn funny
[1:53:17] <%Mordexai0> I thought LadyV was an expert LMAO zyzxLmao
[1:53:20] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie's logic is VALIDAITED
[1:53:21] <Run44forrest> reggies behind you woolie
[1:53:22] <+aishman> Wait who was it?
[1:53:23] <+FxyDEV> rip unroolie
[1:53:23] <Smitteys867> How is woolie's logic wrong? He made sure she knew the exact details of the task
[1:53:23] <%ClericOfSparda> Has Lady V or Punchmom been the killer?
[1:53:34] <+jiggy_snipe> @DedlokPM yea the logic worked cuz they are new
[1:53:35] <DedlokPM> @Smitteys867 exactly
[1:53:37] <+Baekon01> NotLikeThis
[1:53:40] <yash_lawman> @cobalt_phoenix_ EXACTLY
[1:53:48] <kulmoth> @Smitteys867 cause its always in the wallet
[1:53:50] <%SilverDevilfish> Reggie has been the killer more than 50% of the time
[1:53:55] <+CharredChord> New meta kill in front of Jill
[1:53:58] <+HakureiIllusion> This is literally the only time that can work, because now everyone knows what the task there is
[1:53:58] <Vaun0x> @smitteys867 people can memorize tasks between games
[1:53:59] <Aussie_Manny> Punchmom big brain. HahaThink
[1:54:00] <+wydamn> Pro metagaming tip: don't let them know if your mind is made up. Let them continue their garbage lies so you learn better how to recognize them in future games.
[1:54:00] <%Double_Tap_That> Meta gaming to the max
[1:54:03] <+LynbellDaYo> Anyone can know all the details of a task, including impostors
[1:54:12] <RyuShinden> THE META
[1:54:14] <anAngryHamster> Woolie if either of them did the task last round your logic falls apart
[1:54:17] <dots4eyes> Woolie big brain LUL
[1:54:19] <+jiggy_snipe> now everyone knows about the wallet Kappa
[1:54:21] <ComfyFox> its always the wallet tho, this wont work again @WoolieVersus
[1:54:22] <@Solidus_113> I know that you know
[1:54:28] <RyuShinden> WOOLIE IS THE FOOTSIE
[1:54:28] <%Creggamonsta> lol os
[1:54:29] <+ChestMimik> Woolie what if BOTH did the task?
[1:54:30] <%ClericOfSparda> She is right
[1:54:30] <%ChoculaUltra> cue that Detective Conan music riff when he reveals the killer
[1:54:30] <Overloard> the imposter has to kill two and then pass sus onto someone in the next meeting
[1:54:31] <+wolf34736> she couldn't have cleared you
[1:54:32] <cheapdoc> The imposter can also fix the emergencies they cause
[1:54:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CHAT THEY WON'T KNOW THE TASKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T PLAY THIS OFTEN
[1:54:35] <%ClericOfSparda> She is totally right
[1:54:36] <+VoytekBus> i know that you know that i know that he knows that i know, you know?
[1:54:36] <Vaun0x> this was a one time trick yeah
[1:54:41] <+MayorRev> Woolie got the TECH
[1:54:41] <nimu290> no he didnt
[1:54:52] <%Mordexai0> Woolie she's right
[1:54:52] <%ClericOfSparda> Woolie did not actually give factual task info
[1:54:52] <Vaun0x> ACCIDENTAL DUB
[1:54:55] <+WorldsBestPanda> That won't work again though.
[1:54:56] <+jiggy_snipe> yea if Punchmom didn't do the task
[1:55:00] <DianaTheAscian> This tactic will work less and less as u play more
[1:55:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, she's saying SHE couldn't know YOU were in on it
[1:55:04] <%chosenjuan42> big brains
[1:55:04] <uncledoodsauce> my bodacious jumbo barrel can take you anywhere on the island
[1:55:05] <+LynbellDaYo> meta game tech
[1:55:05] <CurrySauseBandit> It's a good play when people don't know the game yeah.
[1:55:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this won't work against people who have played this many times
[1:55:08] <+ChestMimik> this whole plan ignores the possibility of all three having seen the task
[1:55:09] <dots4eyes> It ain't secret now
[1:55:11] <%chosenjuan42> wooliePOYO
[1:55:12] <Equirah> this tactic works *once*
[1:55:13] <%ClericOfSparda> SO why would punchmom know that you knew
[1:55:16] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie voice chairSus
[1:55:17] <+jiggy_snipe> wooow...
[1:55:20] <yash_lawman> long story short. She could of been sus of Woolie
[1:55:22] <@akuda_bar> Oh Golly Gee
[1:55:22] <Make_me_mad> SECRET KNOWLEDGE, he says about a task anyone could have done over the last four games.
[1:55:23] <%chosenjuan42> woolieKICKDAD
[1:55:24] <RyuShinden> Reggie The Thespian LUL
[1:55:24] <%Mordexai0> Because if you just went along with it even IF you were the imposter
[1:55:25] <Ultimatefool> This tactic only works the one time while people are unfamiliar
[1:55:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "youse sounded like a little bitch"
[1:55:37] <Aussie_Manny> Jiminy jillickers!
[1:55:41] <RyuShinden> OH GOLLY
[1:55:42] <%Mordexai0> you could have gotten the dub
[1:55:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "wooooow oh mai goooood"
[1:55:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1320951939224555520?s=20
[1:55:48] <Aussie_Manny> WATCH OUT, RADIOACTIVE MAN
[1:55:50] <%Mordexai0> Like, Punchmom is right
[1:55:50] <nimu290> nah it'll probably work again
[1:55:50] <NotHereToStream> polus is HUGE
[1:55:54] <VidulaSaix> Third map is bad for this little players
[1:55:54] <%ClericOfSparda> It's huge
[1:55:54] <RyuShinden> OH GOLLY GOSH Kappa
[1:55:57] <Run44forrest> reggie... this is the taste of a LIAR
[1:55:57] <+LynbellDaYo> yo, why is Kenny dodging
[1:55:59] <yash_lawman> bigger!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:56:01] <nimu290> last map is huge
[1:56:01] <%chosenjuan42> HUGE QUEST
[1:56:05] <%DreyfussFrost> The map you're playing on now is the worst. The third map is great.
[1:56:07] <Smitteys867> Stick to the maps you know I think, it'll make for more mindgames
[1:56:08] <%DemonOfSalt> woolieKICKDAD "Gorsh!"
[1:56:09] <+ChestMimik> Polus is massive and kind of leans towards killer
[1:56:10] <%TheBensonator_> psaBig MAP
[1:56:10] <cheapdoc> Its not new, but it is by far the biggest
[1:56:11] <+Metballs> Lava is my fav
[1:56:12] <%Irridium> last map is a BIG boy
[1:56:14] <Touchofweeb> Maybe increase the kill countdown even more/ XD
[1:56:21] <yash_lawman> big snow map
[1:56:21] <CappuccinoGuil> The 3rd map is based on John Carpenter's The Thing
[1:56:38] <cheapdoc> Notorious BIG
[1:56:40] <RyuShinden> Polus is huge
[1:56:44] <%Cozy90> the thing is my fav movie
[1:56:45] <VidulaSaix> Not delayed, cancelled
[1:56:48] <haisho> YEAH POLUS TIME
[1:56:48] <RyuShinden> @WoolieVersus POLUS is huge
[1:56:51] <yash_lawman> canceled
[1:56:58] <RyuShinden> Yeah, they cancelled it
[1:56:58] <+ChestMimik> Cancelled. Among Us Original consumed its sucessor
[1:56:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> among us 2 was absorbed into 1 basically
[1:57:01] <+VoytekBus> longer kill cooldown?
[1:57:05] <%chosenjuan42> HUGE QUEST
[1:57:07] <NotHereToStream> don't separate the player base
[1:57:08] <nimu290> yeah its a smart move
[1:57:09] <cheapdoc> Reverse destiny 2
[1:57:09] <Dementedpenguin> Why divide the base when the first is doing good.
[1:57:11] <Kalcom> the reason was the code sucks
[1:57:12] <%DemonOfSalt> Among Us killed Among Us 2
[1:57:14] <+wydamn> If they make a fourth map, I hope it's a tropical island map with weird science shit based on LOST.
[1:57:16] <+LynbellDaYo> Probably not all the features, there's probably a reason they needed to make a new game
[1:57:16] <andre11dr> That's a smarter choice
[1:57:16] <RyuShinden> AU1 cannibalized AU2
[1:57:18] <VidulaSaix> Crucible?
[1:57:21] <%DemonOfSalt> Thereore, Among Us is the imposter.
[1:57:22] <%Cozy90> among us 1 is sus
[1:57:23] <Run44forrest> double down
[1:57:24] <+WorldsBestPanda> Star Fox 2 ?
[1:57:24] <%ChoculaUltra> the culling 2?
[1:57:24] <Louie_Salmon> They could still do a sequel eventually, who knows.
[1:57:24] <NotHereToStream> it was the battle royale game
[1:57:25] <Touchofweeb> Big map means a straight kill win without meetings
[1:57:25] <+Vinyl_J> The Culling 2
[1:57:25] <glass_marcus> Starfox 2

[2:10:54] <MisterArcanine> What’s cool about Among Us: everyone sorta has their own meta game to it
[2:11:12] <VidulaSaix> Its so much fun with 10 people. Shame they couldnt find 4 more
[2:11:15] <MisterArcanine> Like we all have our own special lies or detective strats
[2:11:15] <+b_aleph> 5 time impostor kenny??
[2:11:30] <bazz_tv> 1 impostor for 10 players seems a bit to easy, I would add an additiional impostor
[2:11:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> big brain plays

[2:13:22] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:13:22] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 26 minutes
[2:13:25] <%vextalyst> Woolie gonna be singing alone on the couch lol
[2:13:42] <haisho> wait is this Project Winter?
[2:13:48] <amiavamp> The radio filter effect in this is unnecessary but great
[2:13:49] <+ChestMimik> Flirt with the ghosts
[2:13:50] <yash_lawman> @vextalyst singing baka matai?
[2:13:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @haisho phasmophobia
[2:13:51] <bazz_tv> @CappuccinoGuil yeah but only scrubs hate on that
[2:13:52] <haisho> oh
[2:13:53] <+Scrivener_exe> You might need to reload after turning off push to talk. I had that issue
[2:13:55] <+jiggy_snipe> Fear of Ghosts game
[2:14:05] <@Solidus_113> I think the game has mic always on even if you don't use the setting, to call the ghost
[2:14:08] <bazz_tv> hence why the whole thing appeared in scrubquotes
[2:14:11] <haisho> I heard always on voice and my mind instantly went to Project Winter
[2:14:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @bazz_tv nah, we ain't going to Among Us grand finals at EVO, this is a casual traitor game LUL
[2:14:24] <andre11dr> woolieKICKDAD
[2:14:24] <+b_aleph> Reggie still there
[2:14:25] <%zero_jacks> @haisho u lowkey got me so hype just by seeing project winter
[2:14:32] <El_GhostV1> HA
[2:14:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Crouch: C URGH
[2:14:42] <haisho> I apologize for the disappointment
[2:14:54] <%Irridium> this game mad me cry like a little bitch 10/10
[2:14:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> to be fair project winter is a cousin to among us so i don't blame you
[2:14:55] <amiavamp> At least run isn't Caps Lock rofl
[2:14:57] <haisho> also ew C crouch when did that happen
[2:14:58] <+LynbellDaYo> C is the patrician's crouch button
[2:14:59] <%zero_jacks> na its cool
[2:15:06] <bazz_tv> what game are they switching to?
[2:15:07] <@Solidus_113> C to crouch is life
[2:15:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ew c to crouch
[2:15:10] <amiavamp> You can crouch to hide from ghosts behind objects
[2:15:12] <MBDiana1> Project Winter is just cooler among us from what I know
[2:15:19] <TigerClaws12> people who use C to use shit standing up
[2:15:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's all about mouse button 5 to crouch
[2:15:27] <TigerClaws12> *c to crouch
[2:15:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Anybody who likes C to crouch, you probably like crouching to be a hold instead of a toggle, huh?
[2:15:32] <bazz_tv> Space Station 13 was the original Among Us anyway
[2:15:33] <Mrthefro> Shift for run sarkLul Who Would do that?

[2:17:03] <shooziii> V in the van
[2:17:04] <amiavamp> I still like run on shift but Skyrim showed me that alt for run isn't awful
[2:17:09] <+JustToWatch> V is kind of quiet
[2:17:12] <+wydamn> @bazz_tv ah yes, SS13, the game where you can get strip naked, stuck into a locker, and then thrown into space, and if they didn't weld you into the locker you can still fart to propel yourself back to the station.
[2:17:22] <+MidnightBurst12> nice
[2:17:32] <@Solidus_113> do the tutorial mission
[2:17:33] <dots4eyes> V Demonslayer
[2:17:35] <andre11dr> SS13 is actually OD
[2:17:36] <%ChoculaUltra> cultist and clown are still the most fun classes in ss13
[2:17:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> alright boys place your bets who's dying first
[2:17:44] <%ChoculaUltra> err jobs rather
[2:17:57] <%saladin1911> Vergil would steal Dantes pizza

[2:27:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Avoid saying "James Davis are you here" or a similar question. If you do, only the name will register, NOT the question.

[3:38:45] <+waltzqueen> @redrins she got imported
[3:38:49] <amiavamp> @LiquidDinosaur from what I can gather, the ghost is an actual entity moving (teleporting?) around the map, and tends to stick around one room. The items can put it in various states that make it lose interest in the players.
[3:38:59] <Solidnick18> these ghosts suck
[3:39:01] <redrins> mail order?
[3:39:10] <huskarl_zap> Yuri PogChamp
[3:39:23] <dinnydanny777> Nancy Brown, do you agree that the CDI Zeldas are the best Zelda games?
[3:39:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @amiavamp but does the ghost always want to kill you? Is it possible to pacify it or can you just avoid its murder attempts long enough to get the info and escape?
[3:39:32] <+QuadraticGravity> @Solidnick18 They're playing on a lower difficulty with a five minute safety buffer
[3:39:35] <huskarl_zap> Yuri needs to cut rugs
[3:39:37] <tonfirean> A Yuri needs to be on ice
[3:39:39] <Giant_Key> go alone
[3:39:46] <+QuadraticGravity> @LiquidDinosaur The latter, all of them can murder you.
[3:39:48] <Broand> go alone
[3:39:51] <%MaddyCaddy> If you anger the ghost, the EMF goes off more
[3:39:54] <%Irridium> turn off all lights for Maximum Spook
[3:40:00] <+jiggy_snipe> V should drop his stuff if he can and turn the difficulty up or something
[3:40:01] <amiavamp> @LiquidDinosaur some of the items stop it from attacking. it's more likely to attack as sanity drops and as activity increases.
[3:40:02] <andre11dr> Just keep yelling her name
[3:40:04] <TheHeroAppears> can you do any tricks ghost?
[3:40:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> do Russian weebs named Yuri feel awkward about it
[3:40:05] <Solidnick18> @QuadraticGravity that's fine just thought they be a bit more active
[3:40:06] <RyuuAoi> Gotta be a group. All four go for one round

[3:46:58] <+QuadraticGravity> @LiquidDinosaur Lower sanity = more aggressive ghost activity and more common hunting phases. It can see and hear you, so you usually find a room, turn off the light, and shut up.

[4:20:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> "SOOOUSH" - Ruth, right before Messatsu-ing Reggie
[4:20:06] <tattleworm> i really like the way dead players mics just get shut off mid-scream
[4:20:08] <prime_name> One more?
[4:20:20] <RyuuAoi> Do more
[4:20:23] <+zepelinnn1> one more! one more!
[4:20:26] <+RealThiele> vadered
[4:20:35] <+Blucarot> No more rounds?
[4:20:38] <amiavamp> Was the static earlier when woolie was in the van because of activity being at 10 while using the radio?
[4:20:40] <CappuccinoGuil> It's still very EA right now, there's only one death animation and dead players can't do anything
[4:20:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @amiavamp yes
[4:20:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @amiavamp during a hunt, comms go down
[4:21:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> when activity is at 10 the door locks and the radio doesn't work
[4:21:02] <huskarl_zap> Dark ruth
[4:21:05] <@Solidus_113> it wasn't
[4:21:08] <+Blucarot> @CappuccinoGuil I hope theres no jumpscare deaths, the hand animation is good enough haha
[4:21:09] <RyuuAoi> Gotta keep playing until Midnight on the West coast!
[4:21:25] <+BoBoGaijin> you kept pullin the door when you needed to push i think
[4:21:26] <Broken_Sonex> "Death is great. Come see the other side guys!"
[4:21:26] <happyface699> Legendary
[4:21:26] <@Solidus_113> you gotta use the mouse movement to open the door, like Amnesia
[4:21:37] <CappuccinoGuil> @Blucarot it's more to make the ghosts unique, so you can get that "oh shit, it was a Jinn that killed me" based on the animation
[4:21:40] <mudamudajo> She took you to the sunken place.
[4:21:42] <huskarl_zap> Basement is for dead players
[4:21:44] <+TToonLink> Radio stops working when a hunt starts, but you can get to 10 activity without a hunt, it just means the ghost has manifested physically somewhere in the house
[4:21:49] <RyuuAoi> Welcome to basement hell

[4:22:27] <%hax_metatron> VR works, and the best part of VR for this game is the ragdoll that results
[4:22:33] <NeroInfinite> Ah
