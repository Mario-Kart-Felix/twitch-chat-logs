[0:06:13] <+i_zombee> they struggle to make the couch m/k life rise. it won't. get a desk or use a controller, lol
[0:06:24] <%jiggy_snipe> the cube is so Woolie gets gamer cred. He's been a fake gamer his whole life til now
[0:06:32] <%NWannabe> cube is to exclusive
[0:06:33] <derap41> Be like Pat Cube 18 hours a day
[0:06:35] <blaggablag> I've been sent by pat to slay the non cubelievers
[0:06:36] <KaiserMario> Just like every other peripheral Woolie ever bought, it's perfect, but doesn't fit HIM...
[0:06:48] <derap41> Pat is Cube right as we speak
[0:07:13] <%lotharrio> I come to this stream for hot cube action.
[0:07:13] <MaverickJoker> gotta be honest, i've done the cube for 7 months due to health reasons, you become gelatin in just 5 months and atrophy LUL

[0:09:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> It is for your comfort. If it fails that criteria, it is not worth it for the meme
[0:09:22] <%lotharrio> All I want is Woollie sitting comfy in a cube, looking very upset and annoyed at its practicality.
[0:09:28] <%NWannabe> blurs
