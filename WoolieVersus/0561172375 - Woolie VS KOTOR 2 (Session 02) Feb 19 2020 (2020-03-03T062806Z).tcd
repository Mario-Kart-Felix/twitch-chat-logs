[0:16:47] <%tearfuldevil> droids become fully aware, sentient/sapient, if you don't memory wipe them
[0:16:48] <%bread_assassin> T3 is a skill monkey. He doesn't need that much upgrading.
[0:16:49] <%Ashenik1> Well Woolie what are we but a toaster made out of meat
[0:16:49] <%GraceTBM> your alignment is a reflection of your personality, the fact that it's not a sentient being doesn't change the fact that you're being sour

[0:19:32] <+glgzephyr> definitely the gun
[0:19:34] <ThatGuyThere03> it's more a reference to the AK and the other firearms manufacturer HK
[0:19:36] <+MintMuffinGamer> Is that Little V?
[0:19:36] <DeanX27> Always thought it was just AK-47
[0:19:37] <Tucker0603> AK-47
[0:19:38] <%tearfuldevil> ak47
[0:19:39] <+ShadowArcangel> HK means Hunter Killer and that was the name of a band of one of the developers I think?

[0:20:55] <@Squdnate> Hitman and Hitman 2 had come before KOTOR, both came out during KOTOR1's development, so it's likely, but I dont think it's that
[0:20:59] <Madbearv> there's armors that let you keep your force powers

[0:24:56] <Dova573> huhh
[0:25:00] <%krispen_wa> ECHOES
[0:25:00] <Aydarkzero> i don't know shit about star wars lore outside the movies so this is interesting to
[0:25:14] <Halospaz117> Telos was also Carth's home
[0:25:16] <Dova573> you fail you force test and you become a slave?
[0:25:26] <Dova573> or indentured servant
[0:25:30] <Narukamiiii> All the best lore resides outside the movies
[0:25:32] <+SolidusRex> Reminder: Telos was Carth's home planet
[0:25:38] <am_omega> I would not say its slavery.
[0:25:41] <Tucker0603> @dova573 to be fair, with start the opposite way.

[0:25:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SolidusRex and is that supposed to mean something
[0:25:52] <%StaceMcGate> Telos was very forgettable for me, but that might be because Nal Shadda/Onderon took like 20 hours to finish
[0:25:53] <am_omega> It sounds like its a job.
[0:25:56] <ZeeJiggle> Woolie, my dude, we gotta get you some sick jedi robes of your own.
[0:26:12] <+TopTieramisu> can't wait for Marvel's Star Wars: Civil War
[0:26:12] <muniea3> war bad
[0:26:18] <ThatGuyThere03> damn space monks ruining everything
[0:26:26] <Dova573> I mean as long I have the choice to say fuck ima just travel the galaxy
[0:26:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LORDS OF CINDER
[0:26:30] <%krispen_wa> ECHOES
[0:26:31] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Exar Kun boiz
[0:26:32] <Andrei11Droasca> You'd think Jedi would be fuckin like rock stars considering the mind trick abilities LUL
[0:26:35] <tranquilturnip> it probably wasn't even the first time
[0:26:44] <%tearfuldevil> it wasn't
[0:26:45] <fuji_92> malaka LUL
[0:26:47] <%StaceMcGate> They are called... the Winds of Destruction
[0:26:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She really sounds like the Dark Souls narrator
[0:26:49] <Tucker0603> being a lightside with assassin in SWTOR was fun as hell
[0:26:50] <ZeeJiggle> Mal-shaka paka
[0:26:59] <megamirk> you know malaka, yes?!
[0:27:01] <%tearfuldevil> they retconned in ANOTHEER one
[0:27:01] <Ahk_90> It's almost like this idea of balance with an opposing duality is flawed and dangerous
[0:27:13] <Andrei11Droasca> Malak was a chump
[0:27:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im playing the doom soundtrack in the background and it goes surprisingly well
[0:27:25] <am_omega> The Grey Jedi had it right.
[0:27:26] <%tearfuldevil> i mean the idea of"balance" between light in dark is like, a prequel thing
[0:27:27] <Aydarkzero> why doesn't the Jedi just eat the Sith
[0:27:31] <%gatorafan> Malak got BZZZZZZZT'd
[0:27:32] <Dova573> or that balance means that you have to have the bad with the good
[0:27:51] <+ShadowArcangel> yep
[0:27:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> *Sweats in spoilers*
[0:28:02] <wydamn> Yeyeye we getting in there
[0:28:18] <Aydarkzero> The Jedi didn't invite Sith to the party :(
[0:28:24] <1matheuw> want some cookie and milk?
[0:28:25] <+TheDankDemon> the rule of 2 boi
[0:28:29] <%TRILLTURBAN> Oh boy just wait until G0-T0
[0:28:30] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Darth Vectivus was cool
[0:28:40] <Andrei11Droasca> Yea ,not everyone is down with the Jedi
[0:28:43] <%Irridium> That's basically how Hannibal got to Rome without fighting everyone in Iberia. Just said "yo I just wanna sack Rome" and everyone let them through LUL
[0:28:50] <+eanscrale> They're actual ivory pillars
[0:28:54] <am_omega> At least the Jedi Sentinels were cool.
[0:28:57] <@Squdnate> You know the Jedi skipped the Siths songs on the playlist at the party
[0:29:03] <am_omega> They were just jedi cops.
[0:29:08] <Dova573> man fuck those pompous higher than dou pricks they had it coming
[0:29:10] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie is straight up gonna love the story progression
[0:29:21] <%krispen_wa> This is some Mask of the Betrayer shit
[0:29:26] <Dova573> some republic citizen maybe
[0:29:26] <+sherndon226> God there is so much material for a grey centered story of calling out the bs from the dark side and the light side
[0:29:30] <%Ashenik1> @Irridium THey even joined him along the way LUL
[0:29:35] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:29:56] <Halospaz117> Leveling Up AKA putting a huge fucking target on your back
[0:29:57] <+smegmawasabi> Wait when did woolie play this before
[0:30:03] <+captain_history> @krispen_wa Same company after all.
[0:30:04] <+TopTieramisu> why does woolie pursue this uncanon knowledge? to fuel his disappointment in the canon further?
[0:30:09] <Halospaz117> Last week
[0:30:16] <+smegmawasabi> Ah ok thanks
[0:30:18] <GrizzlyMannerz> Yooo is this restored content mod
[0:30:24] <%StaceMcGate> @sherndon226 I think Grey Jedi are a copout, I got the sense that the force was an influencer towards extremes and that the middle ground is not a true option
[0:30:26] <DeanX27> hol up
[0:30:26] <giga_bit> Anyone else hear the music like... warbling or something?
[0:30:28] <fuji_92> wait LUL

[0:30:44] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 44 minutes and 17 seconds
[0:30:47] <Aydarkzero> the jedi sound like a bunch of assholes
[0:30:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fuck the council
[0:30:49] <Andrei11Droasca> HMMMMM
[0:30:50] <+eanscrale> for the "greater good"
[0:30:53] <DeanX27> The jedi banned you from the server
[0:31:01] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> No force for you
[0:31:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Revan got brinwashed twice LUL
[0:31:02] <devil_may_cum_> Fuck the Jedis
[0:31:05] <%krispen_wa> man fuck the council
[0:31:09] <+TheDankDemon> be like Qui-Gon Jinn doubt that jedi shit
[0:31:17] <Dova573> is the right thing to doooo
[0:31:22] <+eanscrale> Man no wonder people just hate the jedi.
[0:31:22] <%TRILLTURBAN> Inflict Force packet loss on FannyPack
[0:31:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> no wonder Quan-Chi wasn't on the council
[0:31:27] <+HakureiIllusion> The Council removed Pockets's dark side, but couldn't remove her greed
[0:31:29] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> I mean...the Jedi are pretty cult-like
[0:31:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Avatar Spirit-Bending
[0:31:34] <+ShadowArcangel> This is literally I'm gonna slash your eyes so you cant see sort of stuff
[0:31:36] <Redblood801> Yes
[0:31:43] <Aydarkzero> it could happen!
[0:31:45] <+Bluemanzee> I'm so glad Woolie is playing this
[0:31:46] <%krispen_wa> woolie no read
[0:31:48] <%tearfuldevil> deefening
[0:31:59] <%krispen_wa> Ulic Qel Droma
[0:32:10] <%tearfuldevil> god woolie is going to mark out for kreia's plan so hard
[0:32:11] <+TopTieramisu> those are some big shades
[0:32:13] <%tearfuldevil> like a dummy
[0:32:18] <+FrenchTact1cs> ive never looked up her VA, shes good
[0:32:18] <wydamn> I like this, since it semi-justifies players going to the dark side
[0:32:20] <%Theycallmenerf> When the Jedi outcast worked too much overtime they were forced to resign without a severance package.
[0:32:22] <guts32> This game has way better dialogue than kotor 1
[0:32:23] <abelincoln_catpuncher> so hyped Woolie is finally going to play the bestb
[0:32:25] <+kyh9> Spiritual Castration, a concept that Bioware steals and re-uses for Dragon Age
[0:32:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> best Star Wars game
[0:32:45] <rusho> So glad he's on this as well. Totally digging V's star wars garb too.
[0:32:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[0:32:50] <PinkSocks> The dialogue choices in Kotor 1 are embarassing by comparison
[0:32:50] <theKingRamses> war's not great unless you're a mando
[0:32:52] <guts32> STFU
[0:32:53] <%krispen_wa> YEYEYE BACKSTORY
[0:33:07] <+TheDankDemon> sith stole their culture DansGame
[0:33:08] <%StaceMcGate> Tranquil are a bit more extreme, and then they become an allegory for gay conversion in DA 2
[0:33:14] <Dova573> you know this jedi council starting to sound like the catholic church
[0:33:28] <DSD24> Tranquil is a rough existence
[0:33:31] <+TopTieramisu> @Dova573 oh no... not the younglings
[0:33:33] <Blazeofflame> if you got good ideas, keep usinf them
[0:33:35] <EpitaphTransmits> What the name of this incarnation of pockets?
[0:33:47] <%krispen_wa> Fan'y Pak
[0:33:48] <MassConnect> fann y'pak
[0:33:50] <Andrei11Droasca> It just hit me ,Mandos are basically just Sayans LUL
[0:33:52] <DSD24> @quasiplaying Fann Y Pak
[0:33:52] <%Theycallmenerf> Is there anywhere in SW lore that some force sensitive just looked at some random and was BAM you now can feel/use the force.
[0:33:53] <reonome> thanks granny
[0:34:00] <EpitaphTransmits> Yay!!!!
[0:34:07] <guts32> @PinkSocks honestly it's fun that people think that game is better
[0:34:11] <Aydarkzero> thanks grandma!
[0:34:12] <EpitaphTransmits> Thanks everyong
[0:34:13] <Dova573> @toptieramisu we need them when they are young, we cant have old younglings
[0:34:14] <+TheDankDemon> anakin saves kids from the cul... jedi
[0:34:21] <+FrenchTact1cs> need that sweet influence
[0:34:22] <am_omega> Mandos are fucking saiyans, holy shit.
[0:34:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Granny’s force cookies hit differently.
[0:34:35] <%tearfuldevil> mandos are really not
[0:34:38] <%gatorafan> GUN Saiyans
[0:34:42] <%tearfuldevil> they're a culture, not a species
[0:34:46] <+griffball13> My apprentic
[0:34:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> "They are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done."
[0:34:48] <%krispen_wa> god, i love her dialogue
[0:34:51] <%OffKilta> kreia is literally the best thing to happen to star wars and disney completely excised her by uncanoning these games
[0:34:52] <am_omega> Granny's cookies are nice and moist Kappa
[0:34:52] <trickquestionz> Jedi Academy had a staff that could give people force powers
[0:34:54] <Djinnazz> No, Mando's are anti Saiyans
[0:34:58] <%StaceMcGate> Mandos are not Saiyans, they have rules and are not based on an ethnicity/species
[0:34:59] <Halospaz117> Let's be honest, even if Kreia isn't with you, she's with you
[0:35:01] <+FrenchTact1cs> Legit one of the best party members
[0:35:06] <%tearfuldevil> (well, their was a mando species, but they died out years before kotor)
[0:35:06] <Djinnazz> They're like Forse repelent
[0:35:10] <DSD24> Hey guys where's Woolie at right now?
[0:35:17] <Halospaz117> Post-Peragus
[0:35:19] <+therabbles> decade huh
[0:35:20] <+FrenchTact1cs> The start really
[0:35:21] <%krispen_wa> before telos
[0:35:25] <+TopTieramisu> he's at home
[0:35:26] <mr_gunn> Wars?
[0:35:30] <%Theycallmenerf> @dsd24 He’s on his way to Telos
[0:35:35] <%StaceMcGate> Mandos are like Mongolians or Huns, savage but they have principals
[0:35:38] <MassConnect> Woolie's at canada
[0:35:44] <DSD24> @Halospaz117 @krispen_wa @Theycallmenerf Thank you!
[0:35:48] <trickquestionz> Kreia was exercised and ignored from the canon even during Legends. Even the old EU didn’t want to touch the stuff from this game as soon as it came out
[0:35:55] <%Theycallmenerf> You’re welcome!
[0:35:56] <devil_may_cum_> Woolie’’s home right now
[0:36:07] <Redblood801> @trickquestionz Cowards
[0:36:08] <+TopTieramisu> i'm pretty sure the Huns were an ethnic group
[0:36:14] <+TopTieramisu> not just a creed
[0:36:23] <%Theycallmenerf> The mongols are the only exception.
[0:36:23] <%TRILLTURBAN> I love how the Jedi Council in KOTOR acted in almost an opposite fashion to the council in the prequels
[0:36:36] <1matheuw> hmmm
[0:36:36] <+TopTieramisu> well the huns being mongolians
[0:36:43] <%tearfuldevil> i mean kotor 2 is basically fanfiction written by chris avellone
[0:36:49] <DSD24> Soak it in Woolie
[0:36:54] <%krispen_wa> all the EU is fanfiction
[0:36:58] <RecklessPrinny> Who is the +1
[0:37:05] <Louie_Salmon> All writing is technically fanfiction
[0:37:08] <%Theycallmenerf> I’m happy The Hu got into Star Wars via Jedi Fallen Order. Which I recommend to @woolieversus
[0:37:12] <DeepGrave> I feel like Pat is going to lose his shit when he finds out that Woolie is playing without him
[0:37:13] <@Squdnate> KOTOR2 is still my favourite of Chris Avellone's work. I love that man dearly, he's uwu
[0:37:14] <%OffKilta> can't have any grey in our white and black children's story I guess
[0:37:15] <Louie_Salmon> People are just fans of their own ideas
[0:37:15] <Halospaz117> Is chat Fanfiction?
[0:37:32] <devil_may_cum_> Love her voice ngl
[0:37:33] <trickquestionz> SWTOR actively hates and ignores everything that came up in II. It’s why I didn’t care about the EU reset, the old one had already refused to capitalize on the best Star Wars story, so the new one didn’t affect my opinion much
[0:37:33] <Redblood801> We are all fanfiction on this blessed day
[0:37:38] <+Feralspirit41> Mandalorians are the sickest dudes in star wars
[0:37:40] <%Theycallmenerf> @deepgrave Pat said he didn’t want to play Kotor 2 with Woolie.
[0:37:43] <rusho> Fanfiction that Disney can now cherry pick, based on the ending of "Solo". ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:37:45] <Halospaz117> Yeah Kreia's VA is fucking perfect
[0:37:48] <%krispen_wa> WE GOT SOME GOOD HITS IN
[0:37:52] <+sherndon226> @TRILLTURBAN I would say they were similar considering that they both lost nearly every Jedi in the galaxy under their watch.
[0:37:52] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[0:37:52] <Tucker0603> mandalorians are fucking cool
[0:37:54] <worldbrand> LUL
[0:37:55] <DeepGrave> @Theycallmenerf Really? Weird
[0:37:56] <%Ashenik1> @Squdnate He hated Star Wars when he was asigned to write it!
[0:38:01] <ZeeJiggle> Mando's don't get child angry about losing.
[0:38:01] <+eanscrale> "we will tales of this salt for ages"
[0:38:02] <guts32> @Theycallmenerf Why the hell not
[0:38:03] <+ShadowArcangel> I like 2 a lot
[0:38:04] <KIR_Apollyon> Hello everybody! Have a nice evening!
[0:38:05] <%tearfuldevil> @Squdnate Chris "Fallout wasn't political" Avellone
[0:38:11] <DSD24> @KirillApollyon Hiya!
[0:38:13] <%Spankminister> lol
[0:38:21] <@Squdnate> He did, but this game turned him over
[0:38:27] <fuji_92> red bars go home
[0:38:33] <Andrei11Droasca> I thought this is not fanfiction anymore because they mentioned Reven in the new movie
[0:38:36] <%gatorafan> Pick a Top Tier! - Pockets
[0:38:39] <%tearfuldevil> nah
[0:38:42] <Mrbaconator> DARTH SANFORD KELLY
[0:38:47] <@Squdnate> You can feel some pokes at it, being like "This is so stupid"
[0:38:52] <Djinnazz> 'Master"
[0:38:53] <%Spankminister> @Tucker0603 What about that one Mandalorian I forget his name who fell into the Sarlacc that guy's a loser
[0:38:59] <am_omega> "Bruh you think you could come in our tourney with that low tier bullshit? Get drowned in pools"
[0:39:00] <%Theycallmenerf> @deepgrave I think it was a tweet or a clip from one of his streams, explaining Pat likes RPGs when he’s the one playing, he was frustrated with Woolie playing Kotor 1 apparently.
[0:39:04] <%tearfuldevil> a character anmed Revan existining at some point doesn't mean that Kotor was canon
[0:39:05] <%krispen_wa> @andrei11droasca they can change the details around Revan tho
[0:39:17] <%Ashenik1> Julius Ceaser is not gonna give up his power to the senat !!!
[0:39:18] <Tucker0603> @spankminister but then fought his way out
[0:39:21] <%tearfuldevil> it just means that a character named Revan existed at some point
[0:39:33] <%StaceMcGate> and then Revan became a low-tier Keanu looking dude in TOR
[0:39:34] <%Spankminister> @Tucker0603 Nah, Sarlacc burped on-camera he got eet
[0:39:50] <%Spankminister> Vore is canon in SW confirmed
[0:39:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:39:50] <DSD24> The Blade of War
[0:39:50] <%krispen_wa> TOR is even less canpn than the rest of the EU
[0:39:50] <+TopTieramisu> has there been star wars content that involves a galaxy post-jedis? they're always so close to extinction it must happen at some point
[0:39:51] <Tamaguen> What happened to poc-I mean Revan
[0:40:09] <Redblood801> Pay me to kill you
[0:40:11] <fmc009> this light side run?
[0:40:12] <%Theycallmenerf> Also chat, Woolie explained in the first session of Kotor 2, that this is different from SBFP, honestly I’m happy seeing everyone grow from it.
[0:40:15] <DSD24> Man Reven did look pretty lame in the Old Republic
[0:40:18] <Tucker0603> @spankminister EU brother, fuck Disney and their recon shite
[0:40:19] <%StaceMcGate> I'd like to see Woolie's reaction to Revan in TOR
[0:40:19] <%krispen_wa> A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW
[0:40:20] <+Bluemanzee> "I suddenly feel like I owe someone money."
[0:40:20] <%tearfuldevil> @TopTieramisu not really. there's never been anything where that happened
[0:40:26] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Revan is so much better in this game than anything else
[0:40:29] <+TopTieramisu> @tearknack well they should
[0:40:50] <guts32> @Enemy_In_Disguise but he isn't even in this game lol
[0:40:56] <SoaringLettuce> chat, what actress would you have play Pockets in live action?
[0:40:57] <%krispen_wa> DARWINISM
[0:41:01] <%tearfuldevil> @Tamaguen in kotor 1-2 canon? nothing. in swtor canon? lightside revan is cnaon, he goes and fights a secret sith empire, loses, survives as a ghost
[0:41:02] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Darkside Points for Darkside Phil?
[0:41:03] <manwithaxe> "from a certain point of view"
[0:41:06] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> @guts32 Exactly
[0:41:13] <Tucker0603> granny loves war
[0:41:21] <+FrenchTact1cs> Shes too smart...

[0:41:59] <marcdyllan> 1 star forge = deep pockets
[0:42:01] <am_omega> @TopTieramisu Nah, its going to be a hell of a video though.

[0:42:23] <devil_may_cum_> So damn good
[0:42:24] <DSD24> The TRUE WAR
[0:42:31] <+kyh9> Yoda-line
[0:42:32] <Tamaguen> @tearknack Oh. That kinda stinks...Is that optional?
[0:42:34] <%Theycallmenerf> Alright chat I have to go punch in, may the force be with Woolie and little V. I’ll return for the VOD.
[0:42:35] <fuji_92> the war within
[0:42:37] <fmc009> this warframe expansion is crazy
[0:42:42] <Aydarkzero> why not just use both?
[0:42:44] <Zebroneath> Boy, I wish there was something like this in the new movie.
[0:42:45] <%krispen_wa> The Evil Within
[0:42:45] <Andrei11Droasca> Well later will get to the true smarm LUL

[0:42:52] <+captain_history> the writing of this game is so good
[0:42:54] <manwithaxe> shes done a lot of documentaries
[0:42:56] <%Spankminister> One might say, an "Invisible War"
[0:42:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> Kreia is the best
[0:43:05] <MassConnect> don't let your memes be dreams
[0:43:06] <%tearfuldevil> @Tamaguen i mean, you can not do it i guess? i've never played swtor.
[0:43:07] <%Pillagius> This one monologue is written better than last 3 Star Wars movies...
[0:43:07] <%Theycallmenerf> @dsd24 thanks! I’ll try
[0:43:12] <shadowsofpain> war had changed, yet it never changes

[1:10:28] <Joestar1890> Obi-Wan did
[1:10:28] <muniea3> her trolling of Disciple is even better. Is that in the patch for male MC's?
[1:10:30] <FutaSnek> Obi Wan can use GUN
[1:10:32] <+SmortyPuffin> tbf guns are fairly self-explanatory
[1:10:32] <tranquilturnip> Jedi lose resourcefulness by relying too hard on the force "easy button"
[1:10:35] <thetrashman_sc> take a Streamer and take away their twitch channel, what do they have?

[1:11:38] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Overwatch
[1:11:41] <theKingRamses> isn't it a halo ship
[1:11:41] <Junk1106> probably because you teach the Jedi to not suck
[1:11:43] <Blazeofflame> It's a drizzt book title
[1:11:45] <thetrashman_sc> lightside sith is impossible
[1:11:48] <rubbishbinge> Is Todd Ingram a jedi?
[1:11:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Subtract all the powers, and you've got someone with undeveloped skills who expects their stats to be buffed way higher.

[1:12:44] <+TopTieramisu> can force users manipulate the nutrients they intake?
[1:12:45] <%tearfuldevil> @thetrashman_sc i haven't played TOR cause i don't mmo, but one thing i've heard that i think is cool is your sith/republic allegiance has nothing to do with your dark/light allegiance
[1:12:55] <Joestar1890> @dsd24 In SWTOR? Yes. In this game? idk.
[1:13:01] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @Feralspirit41 well she is blind
[1:13:28] <%tearfuldevil> @TopTieramisu a sort of healing/resting trance is a fairly common force power

[1:18:36] <%TRILLTURBAN> dewit
[1:18:38] <tranquilturnip> Double Blade life
[1:18:38] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Yeah totally
[1:18:38] <%Irridium> so you gonna have him visit each planet except onderon real quick so you can repair HK faster?

[1:18:45] <%krispen_wa> V, are you a Handmaiden or Visas guy?
[1:18:48] <Yaddabluh> Everyone can learn the ways, except. wookie/mira.
[1:18:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Polearms are objectively the coolest :)
[1:18:51] <fuji_92> jedi HK LUL
[1:18:53] <+hoenhime344> opinion of the darksaber?
[1:18:56] <Maleicus> mira can learn
[1:18:57] <serpenttucker> What's your overall experience with star wars?
[1:19:00] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Lightsaber whips tho
[1:19:02] <+ShadowArcangel> yep, that bonus is stuuupid
[1:19:03] <%Pillagius> Well... Every "humanoid" character can learn magic tricks
[1:19:03] <Maleicus> you just didnt do it right
[1:19:03] <DSD24> Dual Wielding is hype
[1:19:05] <Psyramics> I love hitting some guy 5 times with my 2 lightsabers
[1:19:06] <%alrobot2014> the lightsaber buffs go fucking nuts
[1:19:07] <Zebroneath> Just a shame Woolie will probably miss out on dialogue on certain characters because of his alignment
[1:19:07] <%SirGO0SE> Is it possible that you're funny, talented, AND good in bed?!
[1:19:08] <SlappyMeats> how about a lightsaber boomerang?
[1:19:09] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus V, can you tell Woolie where he saw the name Telos before?
[1:19:11] <+some_brave_apollo> Ferengi
[1:19:14] <Junk1106> Blaster build no damage run
[1:19:16] <MidnightBurst12> dual wield is the only way
[1:19:16] <muniea3> does the content mod add Disciple for male player character?
[1:19:18] <Tucker0603> fair enough, I love saberstaffs and the lightsaber polearms from SWTOR
[1:19:18] <Noktifer> I'm pretty jealous of the robes. gimme gimme.
[1:19:19] <+thebonebard> saber whips are the worst
[1:19:19] <%SirGO0SE> dang
[1:19:19] <rubbishbinge> hard unga bunga build plz
[1:19:19] <1matheuw> LIGHTSABER WHIPS WHAT
[1:19:22] <+BurkeBigsby> Real Jedi's Tri-wield. atpSuspect
[1:19:26] <+thebonebard> i hate saber whips so much
[1:19:26] <Zayasu> HahaSweat
[1:19:28] <DSD24> Or he could be a punch jedi
[1:19:29] <%Quiet__Viking> light saber pocket knife
[1:19:31] <+hoenhime344> lightsaber odachi
[1:19:31] <%krispen_wa> Lumiya uses them
[1:19:35] <rusho> Hey V, when doing arppegios on the same fret/multiple strings, do you prefer rolling 1 finger, or separate fingerings?
[1:19:37] <Maleicus> no disciple is hard coded to females
[1:19:40] <xiccy> what about the lightsaber armor
[1:19:41] <%mitchteck> Forces of corruption was so good
[1:19:41] <ShiningAxis> Make him use purple lightsabers at least, it's the best color.
[1:19:42] <Katorskay> Oh man I just joined in, i'm glad he's wearing the noob saibot outfit, finally get some mk streams with woolie
[1:19:43] <Maleicus> i dont think its possible at all
[1:19:45] <MidnightBurst12> lightsaber armor
[1:19:49] <indig0bird> When did the stream start? I didn't get a notification on my phone
[1:19:50] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Is this the droid planet restoration patch or just the basic restoration mod?
[1:19:51] <%Pillagius> Oh god... Escape Yavin 4 was crazy
[1:19:56] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> What do you think about the darksaber?
[1:19:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> punch jedi is totally viable with buffs
[1:19:57] <Joestar1890> Fallen Order made me appreciate Switchsabers
[1:19:57] <tranquilturnip> Doesn't sparring with Handmaden bump up unarmed?
[1:19:57] <%krispen_wa> Only Handmaiden can do a good punch jedi
[1:20:02] <+IxDomxI> does dueling still stack with two handed mastery in kotor 2?
[1:20:03] <%OldManJEWc> @1matheuw Read Darth Bane. there's a character that uses a whip lightsaber
[1:20:04] <Ahk_90> I don't remember, were lightmaces and lightaxes a thing?
[1:20:04] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah the end game gets stupid easy
[1:20:06] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Im a big fan of punch jedi in this game
[1:20:06] <%tearfuldevil> @Flambage no droid planet, that mod is bad
[1:20:06] <+ShadowArcangel> punch jedi is super viable until you get good upgrades for weapons
[1:20:06] <%darcfowler1995> I like the idea of a double light saber that splits into two
[1:20:08] <mirtosss> endgame is op "Force Crush" makes bosses feel like nothing
[1:20:10] <%krispen_wa> Blaster Jedi is OP
[1:20:11] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> What about force Kung fu
[1:20:15] <jaygee303> What’s your favourite swtor character story?
[1:20:16] <+some_brave_apollo> the thing is that there's already two punchy party members
[1:20:17] <Sapphire_Breeze> Blaster jedi is strong
[1:20:19] <CruxAustralis> the light glaive?
[1:20:24] <tranquilturnip> Obviously Kappa
[1:20:25] <Maleicus> dueling does not stack with two handed
[1:20:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> How big is Woolies dick?
[1:20:29] <+hoenhime344> whaaaat? woolie is going light? booooooo
[1:20:30] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus V, can you remind Woolie about where he heard Telos? it was carth's home planet, and i doubt woolie remembers that
[1:20:31] <+thebonebard> some day i hope for mace windus gendy wars machine gun punch
[1:20:32] <+SolidusRex> I always make Atton and Mira blaster jedi, they're surprisingly effective
[1:20:34] <Junk1106> Light side gets way stonger buffs long term
[1:20:36] <%Klefth> You said punch jedi, and I immediately thought "light saber brass knucks!?"
[1:20:36] <+thebonebard> in live action
[1:20:37] <%Ashenik1> Which side should Woolie go to get the best stroy experience ?
[1:20:37] <reasonance> 2x upgraded mando ripper pistols with master speed is nuts
[1:20:39] <$QueequegTheater> LS ult power is dope too
[1:20:40] <SlappyMeats> have we considered a lightsaber bow?
[1:20:42] <%Pillagius> So there are Sith Lords, Jedi Master... And marksman would be... Master Blaster?
[1:20:43] <%alrobot2014> oh we going for the blowdryer ability?
[1:20:43] <fuji_92> I'm playing kotor 2 together with you guys, I'm making my handmaiden punch jedi for sure
[1:20:45] <Andrei11Droasca> I did heavy weapons Jedi, wich just melts everything
[1:20:46] <%GraceTBM> hard after telos is what I always do
[1:20:54] <%SirGO0SE> rip and tear
[1:20:57] <%krispen_wa> @ashenik1 Light side is the best in KOTOR II, you lose a lot in DS
[1:20:59] <%Irridium> you gonna get the hk parts from all the planets real quick or let him build it over time?
[1:21:05] <+hoenhime344> woolieWHENS
[1:21:07] <MassConnect> if we go light, is wookiee at risk?
[1:21:08] <%krispen_wa> 2x Rippers is sex with Force Speed
[1:21:09] <tranquilturnip> Opinions on the lightsaber GUN
[1:21:12] <%JJCheeker> I forget is it 3 HK parts
[1:21:17] <Redblood801> Give them both to Kreia, she holds one in her teeth
[1:21:18] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I like who V took off one headphone to hear the incoming Woolie
[1:21:21] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Guys, why is Visas best girl?
[1:21:23] <SlappyMeats> how about a lightsaber ballista?
[1:21:25] <muniea3> the big ball droid, got it
[1:21:25] <serpenttucker> What's your overall experience with star wars as a whole?
[1:21:28] <Joestar1890> lightsaber sniper rifle
[1:21:29] <%krispen_wa> Because she's voiced by Kelly Hu
[1:21:32] <%Ashenik1> @krispen_wa what about grey ?
[1:21:33] <Zohare> wookiee is very at risk unless there is a mod
[1:21:37] <+Bluemanzee> @MassConnect Choice is between Wookie or more Woolie bait
[1:21:37] <tranquilturnip> tiny voice
[1:21:38] <Zayasu> ASMR Kreygasm
[1:21:39] <+SolidusRex> But the Handmaiden is best girl
[1:21:39] <DSD24> @Enemy_In_Disguise Because she has the best design
[1:21:39] <%Klefth> ASMR backseating
[1:21:40] <+hoenhime344> lightsaber kuni with chain
[1:21:41] <%Quiet__Viking> whens does Palpatine come back
[1:21:43] <LewdPrune> I think going light side in Kotor2 brings out the best Kreia talks, so it's good woolie is going for that
[1:21:43] <megamirk> I remember how KOTOR1 threw lightsabers at you, meanwhile 2 barely has any
[1:21:44] <+Tallie> asmr stream Kreygasm
[1:21:44] <+Ancopro> R1
[1:21:47] <%krispen_wa> @ashenik1 You actively LOSE content doing Grey
[1:21:48] <%JJCheeker> Kelly Hu bitterSweet
[1:21:53] <StarlitStunner> @enemy_in_disguise She is a blind murder maid waifu

[1:21:57] <fuji_92> by nar shadaa we get a lightsaber already
[1:21:59] <+oAlec687> hope Wollie isn't watching
[1:21:59] <MonstarGrrrl> kirby strongest force user
[1:21:59] <Tucker0603> how do feel about the concept of lightside sith? it's my favorite in SWTOR
[1:22:03] <tranquilturnip> LIghtsaber suit
[1:22:03] <+some_brave_apollo> when they need another big bad
[1:22:03] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> I love all of these answers
[1:22:04] <DSD24> Force ASMR
[1:22:06] <shadowsofpain> so are you also into the woolie bait or the wrong choice?
[1:22:07] <%Irridium> I mean, hey, apparently he's been killing and possessing people for thousands of years so...
[1:22:09] <Zayasu> atpRtsd

[1:22:20] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I mean you could get HK eariler if you dont mind doing a lil planet hopping
[1:22:22] <Blazeofflame> What if John Palpatine is Kreia's great grandson?
[1:22:24] <Zohare> What planet are you planning to push Woolie towards first?
[1:22:25] <%JJCheeker> I always feel bad
[1:22:30] <%Irridium> it makes NPC's feel bad and that makes me feel bad
[1:22:31] <+hoenhime344> but the jedi are STUPID.
[1:22:33] <tranquilturnip> KOTOR 2 might be the only rpg I've played through evil

[1:22:38] <+hoenhime344> the sith actually make a difference
[1:22:39] <+thebonebard> lightside sith warrior has a lot of good dialog

[1:23:07] <shadowsofpain> So how about that Senate and his unlimited power?
[1:23:07] <$QueequegTheater> CHEESE IT
[1:23:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 The best version of a lightsaber would basically be a multi-bladed 30 foot-long laser-whisk. Even if it drains too much juice or overheats fast, it only needs to be on for a split-second. Can't dodge, block, or parry that.
[1:23:11] <Psyramics> We are the Spoiler Cochroachs, and we scatter in the light of the Unspoiled

[1:24:51] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie loves fisting
[1:24:54] <%Klefth> Fann Y'PUNCH

[1:24:57] <fuji_92> why not both
[1:24:58] <%bread_assassin> Spells are cool.
[1:24:59] <%tearfuldevil> spooky
[1:25:11] <%Irridium> cast Pile Bunker on fist
[1:25:12] <trianglehat> wash your fists after
[1:25:12] <+pyrojack6> What ho muscle wizard, wouldst thru cast us a spell
[1:25:13] <+eanscrale> FIST WIZARD
[1:25:15] <DSD24> Shock fists!
[1:25:18] <%krispen_wa> Lightning Gauntlets are a thing in this game actually
[1:25:23] <+Cymen90> Then why do you dislike Force unleashed?
[1:25:23] <%TRILLTURBAN> FORCE PILE BUNKER
[1:25:27] <%krispen_wa> But loot tables are dumb so you might not get it
[1:25:27] <DSD24> We G Gundam right now
[1:25:28] <+Xalgar> Mace Windu force punching PogChamp
[1:25:29] <Maleicus> good luck finding those
[1:25:32] <+ShadowArcangel> The Mace Windu scene from the 2D Clone Wars?
[1:25:33] <%GraceTBM> krispen what do you mean
[1:25:39] <KaseKaizer> The Force flows through all things ESPECIALLY MY FISTS
[1:25:39] <+thebonebard> in one of the swtor trailers a jedi blocks lightning and the lightning sparks around the saber and he throws the lightning off of the saber into a enemy sith
[1:25:40] <@Squdnate> ELECTRIC WIND GOD FIST, 2F FORCE LIGHTNING
[1:25:45] <%Spankminister> Was Bruce Leroy The Last Jedi in addition to being the Last Dragon??
[1:25:47] <Tucker0603> @trillturban STOP GIVING ME A BONER IN CLASS
[1:25:49] <urdaimon> who's this guy on the left. i thought woolie was black
[1:25:53] <+Cymen90> Putting Force Lightning on your Lightsabre was my favourite move in Force Unleashed
[1:25:57] <%krispen_wa> @GraceTBM There's gauntlets that give 1-12 Lightning damage in unarmed
[1:25:58] <%JJCheeker> i wish there were fire and ice force powers
[1:26:06] <DSD24> @urdaimon That's Little V
[1:26:09] <Zohare> None of these people are real
[1:26:10] <Camail> nostalgiaaaaa
[1:26:10] <%GraceTBM> holy shit where
[1:26:10] <Joestar1890> Light side force lightning used to exist. It was called "Electric Justice" I think.
[1:26:16] <Maleicus> rare af gauntlets
[1:26:19] <%krispen_wa> @GracetBM but since loot is randomized it's possible he doesn't get it
[1:26:41] <%GraceTBM> Joestar you're thinking of the electric chair
[1:26:41] <$QueequegTheater> Taris 2: Electric Boogaloo
[1:26:42] <Djinnazz> CHOICES
[1:26:43] <%Spankminister> Broke: Star Wars with grey morality Woke: Casting Force Lightning on your own fists
[1:26:51] <+ZoltanBMagnus> MAcklunkey
[1:26:53] <KaseKaizer> has any game besides Star Wars Galaxies had vibroknucklers?
[1:26:56] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> CADE BANE
[1:27:05] <goose_attack_almanac> Cad Bane looking rough
[1:27:11] <+Xalgar> I imagine Jedi Unarmed combat would just be Naruto style Martial arts
[1:27:11] <%GraceTBM> vibroknucks is sick
[1:27:13] <%krispen_wa> The CHAD Bane
[1:27:23] <urdaimon> is this RAGE, in space
[1:27:28] <%Spankminister> Yoda has now canonically done Big Number Force Lightning
[1:27:37] <StarlitStunner> @joestar1890 there were a few light side Lightning powers. Emerald light was one and there is the pink ionized Lightning that disables droids.
[1:27:40] <Joestar1890> @krispen_wa vs the virgin fett?
[1:27:42] <Maleicus> huge hp door
[1:27:42] <%Spankminister> As opposed to Palpatine Do Combo Force Lightning
[1:27:42] <Redblood801> Things got rough for Cad Bane when the Empire took over
[1:27:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cortosis Weave gauntlets + armguards so you can grab a saber would be rad
[1:27:53] <DSD24> Wouldn't a Punch Jedi be like a Chi Blocker from Legend of Korra?
[1:28:03] <Maleicus> no
[1:28:09] <+PunkZedB> just casually try to break into someones apartment while two people stand a few feet away
[1:28:13] <+TopTieramisu> a punch jedi would be a force pusher but with fist
[1:28:15] <+Xalgar> Force =/= Schi
[1:28:16] <%Klefth> Dunno, but that sounds rad @DSD24
[1:28:18] <+Xalgar> Chi*
[1:28:19] <+thebonebard> black link no stop breaking jars

[1:28:45] <Redblood801> Okay then
[1:28:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Big 2d10
[1:28:46] <%krispen_wa> Her pragmatism would say that they were too weak to defend their apartments and deserve to be robbed
[1:28:46] <%SirGO0SE> and MY axe!
[1:28:46] <trickquestionz> Like besides the Clones?
[1:28:47] <%TRILLTURBAN> woolieSHOOK

[1:28:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Was that Michael Gough's voice earlier?
[1:28:55] <DSD24> Sword Axe
[1:28:55] <+thebonebard> why does this person have a war axe in their appartment
[1:28:58] <+Cymen90> It is actually amazing how LITTLE Bioware changed shit between KotoR and Mass Effect (I know KotoR2 is Obsidian)
[1:29:00] <+ShadowArcangel> That descriptions is also pretty nice LUL
[1:29:02] <Maleicus> sucks the axe cant be upgraded without mods
[1:29:03] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Kreia would be, you're acquiring power from those who would be so unwise to leave it open

[1:37:39] <+Ancopro> the hungrier you are the more lightside you become

[1:37:48] <MassConnect> beelining alignment points triggers some stuff sooner than is actually practical
[1:38:03] <%krispen_wa> "practical"

[1:38:11] <%krispen_wa> it's so easy that it don't matter
[1:38:15] <tranquilturnip> accepting rewards should be lightside imo, if they believe you earned it

[1:38:59] <trickquestionz> It’s crazy how many murders you can stack up on this station if you go dark side. The police never seem to notice that the murder rate has spiked 500% the moment you step out of house arrest

[1:42:55] <%alrobot2014> the Chuck Norris robe is great
[1:43:00] <DSD24> That looks cool
[1:43:01] <%krispen_wa> The color looks terrible but the model is nice
[1:43:07] <DSD24> I liked the red

[1:43:16] <TimetodiveLTX> i hate playing RPGs but i love watching them
[1:43:17] <%gatorafan> nice bath robe
[1:43:17] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:43:18] <+thebonebard> the color is good but it looks bad on that outfit
[1:43:28] <Andrei11Droasca> It's some Count Duku shit
[1:43:29] <TimetodiveLTX> exceptions include Chrono Trigger,
[1:43:35] <+Bluemanzee> The robes in Kotor 2 looked so much better than the first game. Plus there's so many
[1:43:45] <trickquestionz> It looks like Tom Baker’s burgundy bath robe, when he was playing the Doctor as old and crusty. Worst look
[1:44:11] <Maleicus> just switch weapons

[1:45:07] <SlappyMeats> the traditional nub stabilization technique
[1:45:23] <Andrei11Droasca> This is PC with the restoration mod
[1:45:29] <+ShadowArcangel> could also give the robes to Kreia since she has no armor proficiency
[1:46:22] <%krispen_wa> I managed to get an Ossus Keeper robe on Telos. I never had to change my armor again

[1:50:26] <trickquestionz> You know what, the player character being a Jedi explains a lot about why people are willing to hand out sensitive side quests to you with little prodding. Jedi’s whole bit is basically showing up and solving people’s problems so of course the cops immediately trust you.

[1:53:11] <trickquestionz> This quest was totally unfinished in the original game, so the station was totally doomed no matter what
[1:53:12] <notenoughgirls> the star forge used energy from stars for fuel i think
[1:53:17] <%gatorafan> it's like Pockets never left

[2:11:30] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:11:31] <%Parapattern> What does Pot of Greed do, tho?
[2:11:49] <%Ashenik1> Every time Woolie goeas back to his servituded striper for the money he also should get some fraztions of the dark side points dependent o the amount.
[2:11:54] <DSD24> It lets you draw two cards and place them in your hand
[2:12:03] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Itdoesn't require 2 cards, it also flips cards dealt from the deck
[2:12:04] <$QueequegTheater> @woolieversus they only flip yours, and they're worth it because filling all 9 slots without going over is an auto win
[2:12:07] <megamirk> fuck the Sith Lords, we got some cards to play
[2:12:11] <StarlitStunner> Summon Black Luster Soldier!
[2:12:20] <megamirk> Ashy Larry can play too

[2:16:23] <jamesthebrave> I gotta say, as someone who's been through this game many times, I have never gotten into Pazaak.
[2:16:26] <ZeeJiggle> Bit of a step down in betting, going from Slave to a Candy Bar's worth of money.
[2:16:39] <jamesthebrave> But then, I never really get into any gambling mini things in games.
[2:16:39] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The yellow cards also work on green cards, not just the cards in your hand

[2:37:56] <%krispen_wa> Zal Shey Armor looks GARBO
[2:38:07] <ZeeJiggle> -5 to fashion.

[2:38:13] <megamirk> ancient sith trash bags
[2:38:16] <+Dan_Backslide94> "It's my ass kicking outfit betch"
[2:38:20] <DSD24> Always look cool
[2:38:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can you mod those armors to look good?
[2:38:26] <fuji_92> punch jedi is the way to go, just saying
[2:38:28] <DSD24> Never look bad that's lame
[2:38:30] <Maleicus> its got a skirt hehe
[2:38:34] <%krispen_wa> Zal Shey is the weird armor thing with the dumb butt cape

[2:38:41] <EpitaphTransmits> GET THEM MUNNY!!!
[2:38:45] <%DatAsuna> Fuk da ithorians
[2:38:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GET PAID BROTHER
[2:38:47] <trickquestionz> So fun fact: All the minor force groups described in the gear here, such as the Zal Shey, got lore in outside sources and they all universally hate the Jedi for trying to steal their children and convert them to their force religion.
[2:38:48] <+Dan_Backslide94> @GeneralSCPatton There are texture improvements for armor and robes, but there are no mods for head replacements, just removers.
[2:38:48] <Ahk_90> I want the cash
[2:38:51] <shameimarusen> Get that Dollar
[2:38:58] <manwithaxe> that would mean asthetic mod time

[2:39:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> One of them claims to know your soul is broke, and wants to heal it
[2:39:20] <reonome> woolie is truly channeling the pockets
[2:39:34] <trickquestionz> Ithorians exclusively pay people in Exposure Bucks
[2:39:38] <DSD24> A Heal Turn sounds like a good pun
[2:39:45] <+HodouVAN> your credits are more important than telos
[2:39:46] <+Kriptin> What build/class the going for?
[2:39:51] <MattDemers> I have a fun game, where every time you hear the guide say "left", you watch for the tiny hesitation for Woolie to go right while he's figuring it out
[2:39:52] <mihokspawn> This is like Mass Effect... but good :P
[2:40:00] <%krispen_wa> Ithorian makes more sense from a RP standpoint
[2:40:01] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream

[2:47:45] <Pechugaman> Woolie the slavemaster
[2:47:58] <fuji_92> gilfa gilfa
[2:48:09] <notenoughgirls> take atton's mask
[2:48:12] <shadowsofpain> I've heard of these, good slave owners.
[2:48:15] <manwithaxe> destroy droid is aparently based on that thing Mace Windu does in the Tarkovsky clone wars
[2:48:16] <Safarihat> Not going Jedi handwave?
[2:48:27] <trickquestionz> Woolie will protest the Republic’s anti-slavery laws
[2:48:30] <lennyrager> Kreia can get it
[2:48:39] <%Ashenik1> This playthough confirms theory to many historans that salvery was indeed promoted by capitalism!
[2:48:56] <Maleicus> give kreia the robes
[2:49:02] <%SirGO0SE> now you can show us how to do a fuckin infinite
[2:49:03] <Pechugaman> Destruct droid is mad op with the restored content mod.
[2:49:07] <%RJay80> Woolie lightside code: Through booty my chains are broken
[2:49:20] <megamirk> he is indeed burdened by the booty shakes of money
[2:49:24] <Pechugaman> There is no hatred, there is the booty
[2:49:27] <notenoughgirls> darth pockets hated slavery. fann y'pack however LOVES slavery
[2:49:28] <%krispen_wa> KOTOR II is basically just PTSD: The Game
[2:49:32] <fuji_92> fann y'pak is broken
[2:49:34] <shadowsofpain> Woolie: "My slaves love me, even if the Republic abolishes it they will not leave me"
[2:49:38] <fuji_92> in both senses
[2:49:42] <%DatAsuna> his zip is busted
[2:49:45] <%Parapattern> "My slaves will heal me"
[2:49:47] <+thebonebard> doesnt the slave girl ask to be made a slave again if you take her back to her boyfriend because she hates him so much
[2:49:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:49:49] <ZeeJiggle> Meanwhile Fann Y'Pak is out the door "Wonder how much my girl made"
[2:49:49] <megamirk> twilek get the moneys, dolla dolla bills yo
[2:49:51] <+ShadowArcangel> @krispen_wa precisely
[2:49:57] <%DatAsuna> The pak is gaping wipe open
[2:50:03] <Redblood801> Go get paid
[2:50:07] <%Theycallmenerf> @manwithaxe that’s sick
[2:50:11] <Maleicus> she says she prefers it yes
[2:50:13] <Pechugaman> The Jedi of PAY ME
[2:50:14] <%Ashenik1> SLAVERY SAVED GALAXY
[2:50:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pockets made Fann Y'Pak leave the Sith because of how much he loved slavery
[2:50:26] <%tearfuldevil> the rats?
[2:50:26] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Slave girl def has money for you right now
[2:50:29] <%tearfuldevil> lol
[2:50:29] <fist_wizard_jay> Fuck those hippies FILL THESE PACKS
[2:50:46] <yeildingthought> Fan Y’Pak need’s more cash to fill the void of his connection to the economy Kappa
[2:50:55] <shadowsofpain> Regan's corruption still lives deep within Fann's heart
[2:51:05] <%Ashenik1> Fanny was exiled by the Jedi cause his salve harem was too loud at midnight
[2:51:32] <shadowsofpain> *Revan
[2:51:50] <%krispen_wa> Ronald Reagan's capitalist corruption
[2:51:50] <devil_may_cum_> Fanny was probably exiled for being pro slavery
[2:52:00] <zocano> Telos, like a lot of Kotor2, struggles aesthetically, but I think the way you can solve its core missions to be very fun
[2:52:06] <zocano> ends up making up for it
[2:52:11] <%Parapattern> "I will build an army of slaves and dump my planet's worth of pain onto them instead."
[2:52:21] <+thespacerunaway> howdy fellas
[2:52:35] <%FallenAngelZelos> #Barth4Lyfe

[2:53:53] <devil_may_cum_> @ashenik1 Facts. They were mad he was making money moves
[2:53:55] <wydamn> @GeneralSCPatton ty, starting to draw some loose parallels here LUL
[2:54:04] <PleasantLeech> breakdown breakdown
[2:54:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Ashenik1 I know you mean slaves but I love the idea of the Jedi exiling Fanny because he got involved in a MLM scheme
[2:54:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[2:54:22] <trickquestionz> Kappa
[2:54:28] <%FallenAngelZelos> We've just been talking to party members since the start of the stream, haven't we?
[2:54:34] <ShinobiPhoenix> I got to say, I don't like Barth, he's really whiny
[2:55:02] <%TRILLTURBAN> psaBig Krit
[2:55:02] <abelincoln_catpuncher> you didnt make it woolieeee
[2:55:10] <%Ashenik1> @Valentinius_Anodyne Slaves were just a cover for the realy product SALVES!!
[2:55:16] <abelincoln_catpuncher> wait what
[2:55:18] <@Solidus_113> put stuff in your armour too if you haven't already
[2:55:20] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it didn't make the noise
[2:55:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Did he not finalize it?
[2:55:26] <PleasantLeech> @shinobiphoenix I heard he turns out to be pretty cool
[2:55:29] <muniea3> didn't hear the assemble noise
[2:55:38] <SoaringLettuce> he didnt assemble it?
[2:55:44] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I need to hear the tinkering clinks and clonks
[2:55:51] <%TRILLTURBAN> Oh he'll notice like 2 planets later
[2:55:53] <theKingRamses> is gun actually upgraded
[2:55:53] <%tearfuldevil> wait does critical strike/shot stack with improved crit weapon improvements? that would be so broken in a d20 pnp
[2:56:03] <abelincoln_catpuncher> the gun had the upgraded stats tho
[2:56:11] <Zohare> Assemble noise hasn't been happening
[2:56:21] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhh i see
[2:56:22] <mihokspawn> Are the Mando Blasters the top tier?
[2:56:31] <%tearfuldevil> barth jokes aside
[2:56:33] <rumuloh> It did upgrade, you could see when he put it on.
[2:56:34] <%tearfuldevil> atton is rad
[2:56:43] <zocano> Ya I really like Atton
[2:56:54] <+thespacerunaway> He is amazing
[2:56:55] <AKA_Caillou> Arron smells SeriousSloth
[2:56:58] <AKA_Caillou> Atton*
[2:57:00] <MasterDecoder> @tearknack Atton is Ra(n)d
[2:57:05] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[2:57:20] <wydamn> You look like SUCH a good guy
[2:57:22] <+Dan_Backslide94> LUL
[2:57:32] <%bread_assassin> V’s gotta guide Woolie’s hops into completing Barth’s storyline.
[2:57:42] <%DatAsuna> Don't mess with fan y'pak, he's close to leveling up
[2:57:42] <@Solidus_113> total light side play-through don't worry
[2:57:49] <AKA_Caillou> Xp?! How could even think such thing
[2:57:50] <honeyman18> just looking at a grunt, about how much you worth?
[2:57:50] <%Irridium> look at those statues behind her
[2:57:55] <%gatorafan> V has a plan for Barth, that much we know
[2:57:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ain't no one offering to heal your Force powers in exchange for cash. Gotta get those exclusive services where you can.
[2:58:00] <+thebonebard> whats with those sexy statues
[2:58:00] <%alrobot2014> on my first playthrough i didn't even see barth's storyline
[2:58:02] <%tearfuldevil> i don't like calling him "the good carth", because atton and da1 alistair don't deserve to be put into the same sentance as carth
[2:58:06] <manwithaxe> guys, its time for a woman to lead a restoration project
[2:58:09] <%Irridium> that framing LUL
[2:58:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gotta fundraise somehow to save that galaxy
[2:58:19] <fuji_92> can you tell Czerka is evik?
[2:58:19] <MidnightBurst12> Corporate Bastilla?
[2:58:26] <%tearfuldevil> nah
[2:58:32] <%tearfuldevil> not bastilla's face model
[2:58:34] <+thebonebard> eat the planet
[2:58:39] <MasterDecoder> @MidnightBurst12 Oh god, I can hear it
[2:58:43] <+thebonebard> canabalize the fuck out of the planet make it barren
[2:58:44] <AKA_Caillou> Maximum CAPITALISM
[2:58:47] <muniea3> those are Arnie terminator statues
[2:58:49] <%JJCheeker> Yeah this is Jennifer Hale
[2:59:00] <+thebonebard> planets were made to be stripped
[2:59:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh okay :)
[2:59:10] <MidnightBurst12> that makes sense
[2:59:13] <%DatAsuna> I like this girl
[2:59:18] <$Thorn14> Man I'd kill for a remake of KOTOR 1 and 2
[2:59:23] <AKA_Caillou> Restoring planets is weak
[2:59:26] <muniea3> we're sorry *pets dog*
[2:59:26] <sphereshots12> Blizzard
[2:59:31] <AKA_Caillou> Money is strong
[2:59:32] <DSD24> God I hate that phrasing
[2:59:33] <%gatorafan> She speaks sense, take the money
[2:59:33] <wydamn> "I'm sorry if my scumbag tactics upset you"
[2:59:34] <%tearfuldevil> @Thorn14 i wouldn't
[2:59:38] <$Thorn14> well, remaster
[2:59:39] <%tearfuldevil> modern disney
[2:59:39] <Maleicus> imagine if they combine kotor 1 and 2
[2:59:46] <$Thorn14> Same game just better graphics
[2:59:47] <%tearfuldevil> remaster, sure
[2:59:48] <DSD24> "I'm sorry that you took it that way"
[2:59:51] <+thespacerunaway> it would be glorious
[2:59:51] <%Parapattern> Somewhere in the neighborhood of 100% if the planet's resources
[2:59:51] <%DatAsuna> I'd be a Czerka box
[2:59:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thebonebard Fuck it, cannibalize space-time and the fabric of reality. Transmute existence itself into a giant metaphysical dollar that you can spend nowhere because nothing exists.
[2:59:54] <Ahk_90> LUL
[2:59:54] <honeyman18> she really wants to convince you shes correct
[3:00:00] <+thespacerunaway> maybe flasher combat animations
[3:00:04] <%tearfuldevil> but the thing to remember is kotor2 is barely finished
[3:00:11] <Quigsies> sports tv sports tv tv tv television sports
[3:00:16] <Psyramics> That's just recycling!
[3:00:18] <MattDemers> DEVELOPERS
[3:00:21] <indig0bird> Honestly even if those are good points she's super lying and Czerka would drive Telos to the ground
[3:00:30] <wydamn> Consume product, get excited for next product
[3:00:37] <Maleicus> you can do that without even talking to them
[3:00:38] <theKingRamses> we heard that droid fell off the back of a truck
[3:00:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Legally, of course" :)
[3:00:42] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, Warcraft 3 Reforged has ruined my perceptions of the word "remaster" when it comes to games.
[3:00:44] <%alrobot2014> big dick power stance
[3:00:46] <%SirGO0SE> Nose raised
[3:00:47] <%gatorafan> What an upstanding gentleman
[3:00:48] <Djinnazz> well, i mean, it MIGHT lead to some intersting conversations.
[3:00:52] <DSD24> That Power Pose
[3:00:53] <omenesia> A very tough E-swoop moment
[3:00:59] <muniea3> he's going to snap his spine soon
[3:00:59] <indig0bird> Literally jedi slave owner
[3:01:01] <%Ashenik1> Look at this guy standing on his slaves
[3:01:02] <Quigsies> Despite owning a slave
[3:01:03] <%gatorafan> Dandy!
[3:01:03] <+Dan_Backslide94> Look at this nerd and his super hero pose
[3:01:05] <%Javaa01> Or he just has a crick in his neck
[3:01:06] <PleasantLeech> he's waking up to justice

[3:01:13] <manwithaxe> he looking up at twilek ass
[3:01:16] <Archmortal> We need a KOTOR game that tracks morality shit the way Mass Effect does. Both good and bad stack up instead of just hindering each other
[3:01:16] <wydamn> The Universal Justice
[3:01:17] <SlappyMeats> he's looking up to his projected PROFITS
[3:01:17] <%Parapattern> He's waking up to ass justice
[3:01:20] <+IxDomxI> his actions are those of justice
[3:01:21] <AKA_Caillou> Fuck the Jedi
[3:01:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wake up to the justice that is dancing Twilek asses

[3:02:17] <honeyman18> Jedi lookin ass
[3:02:20] <EpitaphTransmits> Nah get the burrito in Chipotle
[3:02:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Why would you ever willingly eat Taco Bell?
[3:02:24] <%JJCheeker> Chipotle is no good
[3:02:25] <Redblood801> So you can get your money from the dancer every time you level up.
[3:02:29] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Viva Pinata?
[3:02:29] <@Solidus_113> I like Fat Bastard Burrito

[3:02:49] <sirsammalot> wooliePOYO
[3:02:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> WOW
[3:02:50] <PleasantLeech> if you lived next to a taco bell and knew how cheap it was you'd understand
[3:02:55] <Ahk_90> WOW
[3:03:00] <%TRILLTURBAN> Rude
[3:03:01] <%DatAsuna> In swtor there's a very suspect "rodian mayonnaise sandwich" that only the bravest dare sample.
[3:03:02] <Manly_Rose> Aquire food
[3:03:05] <fuji_92> enbDonut eating time
[3:03:11] <%JJCheeker> It's nice having food regulations
[3:03:16] <honeyman18> near dirt meat
[3:03:19] <RoboticRexkek> there so few of them
[3:03:20] <theKingRamses> cheap and late food
[3:03:30] <available_line> So what do you think about the game so far, Woolie?
[3:03:32] <+kewlmyc> Go to Texas and get some legit Texmex
[3:03:33] <%NickHatesSnow> yea
[3:03:33] <+BionoidLCR> dennys is horriblr
[3:03:35] <DeadNinja1> Taco Bell is a good place for a $4 meal, not high quality.
[3:03:37] <PleasantLeech> is about 30 percent meat if I remember correctly
[3:03:37] <+BionoidLCR> waffle house is where its at
[3:03:42] <SlappyMeats> you eat the food you can afford, and grow to love it
[3:03:46] <peanutbutteroven> Damn thats so true
[3:03:50] <AntifaCatboy> Denny's has great burgers tho
[3:03:51] <+MrSammichMan> Taco Bell is great when you wanna eat trash.
[3:03:51] <%BioHunter> taco bell taco bell, product placement with taco bell
[3:03:52] <serpenttucker> You don't go to taco bell because you want quality food. You go to taco bell because it's a lot of food for a low price.
[3:03:54] <+SpaceCapnCrone> the post-gig Slam is a proud tradition
[3:03:56] <Ahk_90> 3 AM fast food grease is SO GOOD
[3:04:01] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Kentaco Hut
[3:04:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> V seems like a real fun dude to hang with
[3:04:17] <MidnightBurst12> I apparently live near the world's only decent denny's
[3:04:26] <+messentry> i really love woolie's sweater?
[3:04:29] <+radiosanchezz> Did Little V just not leave since last time?
[3:04:30] <Redblood801> Time to Muckbank
[3:04:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Time really flies when you're implicit in the galactic slave trade
[3:04:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> You go to Taco Bell because you want a big greasy meat cheese thing that's cheap, and tastes like your cheap fix
[3:05:42] <MassConnect> this stream is a chronoscope into the last stream that never stopped
[3:05:50] <fuji_92> welp see yall in a hour KonCha
[3:05:52] <Maleicus> wow i can go eat and comeback for more kotor
[3:06:02] <+Estuko> LUL
[3:06:08] <muniea3> that is very incorrect
[3:06:20] <Redblood801> That's a hill to die on I guess
[3:06:23] <rubbishbinge> FFT would like to talk to you
[3:06:34] <%DatAsuna> You need the book to understand them
[3:06:34] <$QueequegTheater> They ain't wrong
[3:06:34] <zocano> man SWTOR is ultimate character assassination
[3:06:35] <+some_brave_apollo> yes it is
[3:06:38] <MidnightBurst12> SWTOR was a mistake
[3:06:48] <rosabellamelantha> SWTOR is SHIT
[3:06:55] <DocMadfox> I enjoy SWTOR, but it's not KotOR3
[3:06:55] <Halospaz117> SWTOR is fine on it's own, but fuck anytime it tries to connect to KOTOR
[3:06:57] <%sshen> SWTOR shat all over both KOTOR games
[3:07:06] <LewdPrune> SWTOR is good so long as they aren't referencing anything from KOTOR
[3:07:10] <%DatAsuna> SWTOR doesn't actually change Revan that much, people just forget the comics .etc already defined his identity. And the same writer did kotor 1 and the revan parts of kotor.
[3:07:11] <zocano> SWTOR is fine as pure popcorn star wars in its basic class stories, but it's not KotoR2
[3:07:31] <%DatAsuna> Spoilers: the idea of Revan in your head is not the Revan that was actually written in the actual media.
[3:07:31] <KCFusecoast> Yo Woolie just found your channel what is up? Love your fighting game talks
[3:07:32] <%tattleworm> jedi knight's generic af
[3:07:33] <Redblood801> Imperial Agent though
[3:07:38] <+ShadowArcangel> SWTOR's only way to be enjoyed for me is to turn my brain off and see cutscenes of my character doing cool shit. But I can't think too much on the lore or it just annoys me
[3:07:38] <+Spr0cket> i liked huttball
[3:07:45] <theKingRamses> i enjoyed my time as a sith juggernaut
[3:07:46] <%sshen> Anything better than jedi consular and the space aids story
[3:07:50] <DocMadfox> Fuck Huttball
[3:07:54] <RoboticRexkek> yikes
[3:07:56] <Murphio_GS> Sith warrior though
[3:07:58] <LewdPrune> I think the Sith stories are written pretty well, especially Light Side Sith
[3:08:01] <DocMadfox> Galaxies was fucking great
[3:08:02] <%SirGO0SE> same. i liked it though
[3:08:04] <wydamn> I just realized V is dressed like a jedi

[3:08:25] <+IxDomxI> light side bounty hunter is fun tho
[3:08:25] <serpenttucker> I still like andromeda and 2
[3:08:25] <RoboticRexkek> *yikes
[3:08:26] <DocMadfox> DA2 is fine, but it's not a fucking $60 game
[3:08:26] <zocano> It's time to stop
[3:08:29] <ChortlingKraken> ALL EA LuL
[3:08:29] <Explodincatz> i never did never will

[3:08:30] <@Solidus_113> All EA games
[3:08:31] <Zohare> Cursed preordering
[3:08:32] <Ser_Randal> the dragon age 2 fans emerge from the caves
[3:08:34] <+mighty_max_t> I almost got the MVCI collector's edition. Glad i didn't
[3:08:37] <muniea3> oh man I can't wait til Woolie meets baby Palpatine
[3:08:37] <%NickHatesSnow> All EA games damn
[3:08:39] <%LordSDB> How did you keep preordering only bad games
[3:08:39] <%BioHunter> I love da2. its has problems I the writing is great
[3:08:41] <theKingRamses> EA LITTLE V, STAY AWAY FROM THEM
[3:08:42] <%JJCheeker> The first Dragon Age is good the rest of them no thanks
[3:08:42] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus What are you preordering in the future so we can not get it?
[3:08:42] <%sshen> RIP pandemic studios
[3:08:42] <+charmquarke> you know you can cancel pre-orders after the game comes out, right
[3:08:49] <+SolidusRex> I only ever pre-order things I KNOW I am going to get
[3:08:52] <fuji_92> DA2 is cool, Hawke is cool BibleThump
[3:08:54] <+JariahSynn> haven't pre-ordered since fire emblem three houses Kappa
[3:08:59] <MattDemers> ME3 with the KINGDOMS OF AMALUR armor
[3:09:00] <%alrobot2014> i got da2 for 10 bucks and was happy with that price
[3:09:01] <+mighty_max_t> Love the game, the quality of the statues/gems were abysmall though
[3:09:03] <%DatAsuna> Nobody respects the founders xD
[3:09:09] <serpenttucker> I still rep andromeda
[3:09:09] <Manly_Rose> Fem Hawke is cool
[3:09:11] <DocMadfox> I love DA2, but it's because I got it for $5. If I paid $60 I'd be fucking pissed.
[3:09:12] <SlimeSlimeSlime> The "Founder" title isn't anything to be proud of.
[3:09:18] <%DatAsuna> But yes the best bits of SWTOR are the bits that just tell it's own story,
[3:09:23] <zocano> Dragon Age 2 has some really neat and decent ideas, it's middle act is *really* good, and I genuinely enjoy the Anders pivot
[3:09:27] <indig0bird> @DocMadfox Truth!
[3:09:32] <%DatAsuna> I'd lowkey put the Knight story 7/8 on the tier list
[3:09:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woke up to Justice, or acknowledged Doomslayer as the bigger evil?
[3:09:44] <zocano> It's just so much of it is also crutching on people being idiots
[3:09:47] <nolanpfeiffersaiyan> RIP pop smoke
[3:09:51] <%gatorafan> Balls like the color of the sky
[3:09:57] <nolanpfeiffersaiyan> Good afternoon
[3:09:59] <$QueequegTheater> YEAH I FUCKING BET
[3:09:59] <serpenttucker> Oh so halo 2
[3:10:07] <Murphio_GS> Skyballs
[3:10:21] <fuji_92> as it should gut?
[3:10:24] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus Do you still play mobile games?
[3:10:26] <%Ashenik1> Did Woolie watch noclip docs?
[3:10:31] <+Tojan89> the day Eternal drops: SLAP THAT HYPER NUT
[3:10:31] <+sherndon226> Swotor is fine to play now and the Sith Warrior/Bounty Hunter/Imperial/Smuggler/Trooper stories are good
[3:10:49] <rosabellamelantha> No
[3:10:49] <+chiluzza> THE TRAITOR IS NOT DOOM SLAYER
[3:10:50] <DocMadfox> That's been confirmed to be another dude
[3:10:51] <Halospaz117> Naaaaah, he ain't the betrayer
[3:10:54] <@Squdnate> No
[3:10:54] <%tearfuldevil> thats not true
[3:10:54] <%NickHatesSnow> no
[3:10:55] <fuji_92> nah, thats Kratos
[3:10:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Doomslayer is not necessarily the Betrayer
[3:10:56] <zocano> Nope
[3:10:56] <KaseKaizer> not doom slayer, the other dude
[3:10:56] <+Estuko> No
[3:10:57] <%gunsrlove> No , thats not true
[3:10:57] <rosabellamelantha> the traitor ISN'T doomslayer
[3:10:58] <+mighty_max_t> (X) Doubt
[3:11:07] <DSD24> I thought it was Daisy
[3:11:08] <@Squdnate> Daisy triggered Doomguy
[3:11:09] <%gunsrlove> The betrayer is a separate character in Eternal
[3:11:10] <DocMadfox> Devs confirmed Doomslayer is NOT the Betrayer
[3:11:16] <$QueequegTheater> Traitor, not
[3:11:16] <fuji_92> it's daisy the rabbit bro
[3:11:20] <Halospaz117> There was a theory that Slayer was the betrayet in the backstory, but that got unconfirmed
[3:11:25] <KaseKaizer> LUL
[3:11:32] <%DatAsuna> Why did ANYONE think the betrayer was doomguy?
[3:11:35] <%DatAsuna> It was never stated
[3:11:52] <@Squdnate> People are stopid and wanna connect stuff just to connect it
[3:12:02] <+BionoidLCR> @DatAsuna they would rather jump the gun than pay attention to factual information
[3:12:04] <@Squdnate> No is really ever gone
[3:12:08] <%DatAsuna> It's the Revan shit all over again, people make stuff up then assume they read it somewhere
[3:12:08] <DocMadfox> Dooku's
[3:12:12] <megamirk> Kyle Katarn's
[3:12:15] <megamirk> from JO
[3:12:17] <+SolidusRex> Luke's
[3:12:19] <+some_brave_apollo> Luke's
[3:12:20] <%Ashenik1> Dooku
[3:12:21] <+Dhrall> Dooku
[3:12:21] <+JariahSynn> Crossguard
[3:12:21] <%BioHunter> 2d grevious is amazing
[3:12:23] <mihokspawn> SHOTO
[3:12:23] <%DatAsuna> Satele Shan or Mace Windu
[3:12:24] <Maleicus> i dont pay enough attention to hilts
[3:12:32] <DocMadfox> IT'S A FENCING LIGHTSABER THO
[3:12:34] <+Estuko> It's AWESOME, fencing! I know fencing and that gun fucking appeals to me
[3:12:35] <%ECRead> I love Dooku's
[3:12:38] <Vital_Ire> 2d greivous is KING
[3:12:39] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It's crooked so you can stab easier
[3:12:43] <+Estuko> lightsaber, not gun. ffs
[3:12:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> It reflects him, because he's crooked and weird.
[3:12:49] <%JJCheeker> Why is it curved like my.... I mean never mind
[3:12:51] <%sangio3> sangio3 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:12:55] <+chiluzza> Fencing lightsaber is the hard counter to normal jedi
[3:13:00] <DocMadfox> What's the minimum number of bits to donate to Woolie?
[3:13:07] <goose_attack_almanac> Asaaj's lightsaber is my favourite
[3:13:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @docmadfox 500
[3:13:14] <DocMadfox> Fuck I'm broke
[3:13:17] <+Estuko> @DocMadfox whatever feels right in your heart
[3:13:18] <%DatAsuna> Shame it's so vague nobody knows for sure
[3:13:21] <+frankthetank285> the best part of the pre quils is the fighting is a lot of real sword play
[3:13:24] <theKingRamses> the animated series has a pretty good one show up eventually
[3:13:25] <+slunkymcgee> iirc, Sir Christopher Lee had a lot of influence in the design of his character's lightsaber
[3:13:27] <%Irridium> would've been neat if she got that at the beginning of the movie instead of luke's just getting fixed
[3:13:31] <KCFusecoast> Assajj Ventress and the Inquisitor had cool ones too
[3:13:43] <%DatAsuna> Reminder: the saber colours denoting class is a game mechanic but never was actual lore
[3:13:44] <KCFusecoast> Dooku's my favorite lightsaber though by far!
[3:13:45] <LewdPrune> That's assuming new canon even cares about jedi classes
[3:13:48] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Spoilers for one of the worst movies of all time, lol.
[3:13:50] <yeildingthought> Too bad we didn’t get to see 75% of that movie Kappa
[3:13:58] <%DatAsuna> I also vouch for KR0
[3:14:01] <@Squdnate> dats a good game
[3:14:10] <Vital_Ire> personally I'm fond of the 4th one here in jedi academy's design for hilts https://jkhub.org/screenshots/monthly_02_2019/925ca1180c5421258c5437ac2b5999d0-01.jpg
[3:14:10] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Vital_Ire
[3:14:11] <%DatAsuna> Fuk the inquisitors
[3:14:13] <DPmusique> Genndy Grievous > Episode III Grievous
[3:14:19] <+Estuko> the lightsaber makes the sounds that go SOISOISOISOISOI
[3:14:20] <ZeeJiggle> Don't talk to me about the stupid copter sabers god dammit
[3:14:23] <Djinnazz> oh god...
[3:14:42] <KCFusecoast> Dooku's lightsaber though is also very useful for MAkashi Form II
[3:14:42] <%DatAsuna> The ring guard is lame even when they don't spin
[3:14:42] <DPmusique> Anakin shouldn't have an apprentice
[3:14:43] <goose_attack_almanac> Don't the people that spin with those immediately GET IT HARD
[3:14:43] <%SirGO0SE> man i love woolie's grandma's couch sweater
[3:14:46] <Halospaz117> THE DEAD SPEAK
[3:14:48] <+some_brave_apollo> Thank's Crispin
[3:14:48] <Raraldor> is this the beginning on your playthrough?
[3:15:02] <fuji_92> Crispin Wa
[3:15:09] <%DatAsuna> CIS scum
[3:15:17] <DocMadfox> Gun Jedi are great
[3:15:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:15:22] <KCFusecoast> I am a CIS scum
[3:15:27] <KCFusecoast> @DatAsuna
[3:15:31] <Maleicus> dual guns with speed is great
[3:15:33] <+Estuko> LLU
[3:15:35] <+Estuko> LUL
[3:15:38] <Zohare> @Raraldor This is the second stream of the playthrough
[3:15:40] <DartonLance> gun tank in swtor was kinda fun
[3:15:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL
[3:15:46] <Raraldor> Thanks
[3:15:55] <fuji_92> what if *blank* got *blank* LUL
[3:15:56] <Redblood801> That's just fanfiction
[3:16:05] <KCFusecoast> Batman with the green lantern ring is good
[3:16:07] <$QueequegTheater> cheer510 So the problem with Grievous is the Krillin problem. Grievous is so absurdly lethal that he can never win any fight against a major character, much like the Destructo Disc will cut through literally anyone so he can never be allowed to hit anyone (Cell no-selling it was actually filler)
[3:16:10] <Redblood801> Ass is home town
[3:16:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If he was still on the light side he wouldn't need armor :)
[3:16:13] <DocMadfox> Booty booty booty booty, rockin' everywhere
[3:16:18] <%SirGO0SE> break time for kissing
[3:16:19] <+SolidusRex> Don't deny that Donald Duck with a Red Lantern ring isn't OP
[3:16:22] <$QueequegTheater> Damn it
