[0:08:32] <JowiJoestar> the action feels good and if you dig that style it's worth a look
[0:08:34] <orzydorzy> ffxiv
[0:08:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo reggie, what you think about a top player talking shit in another fighting game but not being able to back it, ala punk on dbfz

[0:08:55] <DapperCadavr> Gaia Online
[0:08:56] <+noilkaizen> if that ever comes out
[0:09:03] <brachydios777> Wow begrudgingly
[0:09:06] <churropoppa> Adventure Quest
[0:09:07] <+noilkaizen> you probably will prefer guild wars 2
[0:09:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> now i'd say maybe black desert
[0:09:07] <+RustyCoyoteA> Monster Hunter Rise :)
[0:09:08] <@Solidus_113> Old School Runescape is still up there
[0:09:09] <+balouie> star wars the old republic isnt bad story wise
[0:09:09] <DSD24> Runescape is pretty cool
[0:09:09] <+Taisuru> XIV is one of my favorites of all time
[0:09:11] <RyuuAoi> Play 3rd Birthday, Reggie
[0:09:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> no, WoW is terrible
[0:09:15] <+Taisuru> Any genre
[0:09:20] <UnrealStyrofoam> It's still my favorite
[0:09:21] <%lem______> reggie vs ff14
[0:09:21] <orzydorzy> they fucked up the story of wow so bad
[0:09:23] <DSD24> The Old Republic has some cool shit
[0:09:25] <someduden> fluff brooooiiiii
[0:09:25] <Ezikeyal> SWTOR was good, don't know about currently
[0:09:27] <coziestbank> Warframe for "non-rpg" people.
[0:09:28] <BlackermanZX> does PSO2 NG count
[0:09:29] <+Jiggisnipe> isn't that mmos?
[0:09:29] <brachydios777> Never trust Blizzard
[0:09:33] <+noilkaizen> ffxiv isn't as grindy as wow
[0:09:36] <specialpipo> That old WoW, questing has changed quite a bit.
[0:09:36] <@Solidus_113> it's a good final fantasy game
[0:09:36] <%Shad0wTag> I'm the Destiny 2 player so I'm there
[0:09:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> ff14 doesn't require to much of a grind for fun
[0:09:38] <+shiokenstar> reggie vs FFXIV story mode
[0:09:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> GOOD STORY
[0:09:41] <+alekto989_m31> all classes on one character
[0:09:47] <UnrealStyrofoam> It's got cute stuff and houses
[0:09:48] <NickHatesSnow> FF14 isn't really grindy
[0:09:48] <+noilkaizen> not really lol
[0:09:55] <RyuuAoi> He ain't ready for Bloodborne,....
[0:09:57] <Ezikeyal> FF14 is a Big time sink for completion
[0:10:02] <+RustyCoyoteA> Devs encourage health balance
[0:10:05] <+DakotaMacDoodle> FF14 has good story and fun mechanics but big-time sink
[0:10:12] <Ezikeyal> Some odd like 100 Hours for just the basic 1.1 version of the game
[0:10:18] <%Shad0wTag> The real MMO is Ultimax with your buds
[0:10:20] <Ramasama13> ff14 might as well be like 5 or 6 games in terms of story length
[0:10:21] <@Solidus_113> FF14 is 5 really good final fantasy games that tie together
[0:10:24] <%notsoy> time to see woolie's inner big body come out
[0:10:26] <brachydios777> It sucks I can’t play it cause it looks really good
[0:10:28] <NickHatesSnow> FF14 is just long and packed not grindy
[0:10:29] <yukichocomilk> the community in ff14 is amazing, people are so helpful and nice
[0:10:31] <someduden> I wanna get I to ff14 but wouldn't want the pressure that comes with having a subscription
[0:10:37] <%TubeMan642> @Shad0wTag Don't worry your aren't alone Guardian
[0:10:44] <RyuuAoi> Pat's tv fucked up the other night too
[0:10:58] <%Shad0wTag> Oh shit hello
[0:10:58] <NYCrownlessKing> ahh reggie's a pvper Kappa
[0:11:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:11:05] <%lem______> arr is a chore
[0:11:06] <%LastHazzerd> MMOs are not very PVP centric
[0:11:07] <+Jiggisnipe> PK Reggie Kappa
[0:11:08] <Ezikeyal> FF14 is good for that, you get access to PvP real fast in that one
[0:11:15] <coziestbank> The original Guild Wars was the PVP MMO
[0:11:16] <BlackermanZX> wow can be fun but holy shit it takes some time
[0:11:18] <UnrealStyrofoam> I haven no interest in playing FF14. I don't wanna look like a Dr.Seuss character
[0:11:19] <@Solidus_113> fighting game brain
[0:11:21] <+Taisuru> FF14 PVP is BAD though
[0:11:23] <NYCrownlessKing> we aint gonna inv reggie....to ff14...for pvp
[0:11:24] <NYCrownlessKing> stop it
[0:11:26] <+noilkaizen> guild wars 2 is probably the best pvp mmo
[0:11:26] <NYCrownlessKing> get some help
[0:11:34] <Ezikeyal> Depends, Rival wings is garbo, but frontlines is big nonsense fights
[0:11:36] <NickHatesSnow> Reggie would be a wilderness fiend in RuneScape
[0:11:37] <nintega010> you literally just want to play a moba
[0:11:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, i wish some good RTS games would come to ps5
[0:11:43] <RyuuAoi> Billy probably would a did it for free for you.
[0:11:45] <yukichocomilk> @noilkaizen true and you can get into it immediately
[0:11:57] <brachydios777> The only kinda MMO where pvp is a focus is Destiny 2 technically
[0:11:58] <BlackermanZX> the only MMO i invested a lot of time is Ragnarok Online
[0:12:05] <DSD24> Wow
[0:12:08] <+Jiggisnipe> why?
[0:12:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> nothing
[0:12:12] <DSD24> Fraud Detected
[0:12:13] <+Taisuru> Guild Wars 2 is def what Reggie wants from an MMO
[0:12:17] <GHouseduivel> NO
[0:12:22] <+Jiggisnipe> fake bragging rights
[0:12:30] <%Shad0wTag> REGGIE ITS AN EVERY GAME PROBLEM
[0:12:34] <GHouseduivel> I'm going there even if I'm trash.
[0:12:41] <RyuuAoi> I WANT IT NOW, REGGIE
[0:12:43] <JowiJoestar> i guess it's the same question you gotta ask to rage quitters right?
[0:12:45] <+toastybites> i knew a guy who did this for Destiny 2
[0:12:49] <Ezikeyal> Paid carries and stuff are SUPER common
[0:12:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> early sfv is weird cause like, every character had the same combo routes
[0:12:59] <+DakotaMacDoodle> WoW devs support that shit while FF14 devs actively shut that stuff down
[0:13:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> i can at least understand Rage Quitting
[0:13:07] <brachydios777> Paid carries are the worst
[0:13:09] <NYCrownlessKing> same question u gotta ask ppl who throw there controllers.

[0:54:41] <TigerClaws12> cube time?
[0:55:21] <jKazej> How's the air control? Can you just follow above someone to try and elbow drop them where they land?
[0:55:45] <brunoberserk> bioniiic .... AAAAARRMMM
[0:55:51] <%LastHazzerd> it's a shame this kinda game means background music is bad, for audio queue reasons
[0:56:09] <%ChoculaUltra> is there a Steam port or is this another EGS exclusive kind of jams
[0:56:20] <atomicxdj> time to body some fools

[0:58:27] <infiniteFERN> that's cool
[0:58:45] <%jepupu> Such a basic juggle. But a combo is a combo
[0:58:55] <Belakitu> So finish your plate?
[0:59:01] <DSD24> Are there rolls?
[0:59:08] <Voidvas> It's the Dark Souls of Fortnite
[0:59:12] <%notsoy> jecht shot
[0:59:14] <+ikantreeed> it also looks hard to pick up items
[0:59:25] <DSD24> Imagine if there's Tifa moves in this
[0:59:26] <artoflec> lol was it really called wreck shot in this that's pretty funny
[0:59:29] <+SaurianCrash> needs music from KI T.J. Combo V:
[0:59:29] <Broand> It's a bicycle kick! It's a classic football manuver!
[1:00:05] <DSD24> That wakeup move seems really easy to predict
[1:00:33] <Belakitu> Thats a BR staple
[1:00:34] <thepardack> dropkicks and uppercuts can power through attacks is what that signs was basically saying
[1:00:58] <+ikantreeed> @Broand canadians don't play football, only blitz ball
[1:01:40] <kulmoth> Izuna drop pog
[1:02:05] <morningmoondude> wtf those were shot seconds, it's supposed to be like forty seconds to count to ten

[1:10:35] <Goo_Ftroop> You don't get a supermove if you use it to revive, and normal Superstar heals more over longer

[1:21:06] <rosemon5001> id imagine 5 2 3 would be the best buff setup

[1:26:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:32] <%lem______> @ditalos for like 20 minutes

[1:26:38] <%lem______> and then its over
[1:26:42] <+N1ntend0d0> there will be console betas

[1:27:05] <Belakitu> So its like Shield Pop from smash?
[1:27:07] <ditalos> why did they make it like this? this game is so fun
[1:27:17] <%Cozy90> I really want them to add death comms
[1:27:24] <+allups> does running take stam?
[1:27:28] <Invess> @Cozy90 those are always good
[1:27:30] <LoneFonte> yeah
[1:27:35] <+topendbuzza> BELL
[1:27:44] <+SaurianCrash> ding ding

[1:27:56] <ditalos> I'm gonna watch the recording later on cuz I gotta leave but good look woolie this game is very fun
[1:28:18] <%Cozy90> @Invess i cant think of a single game that wouldent be great without some death comms LUL
[1:28:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm late reeeeeeeee
[1:28:41] <+SaintSalted> tackle is really fast for its reach
[1:28:56] <%Cozy90> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Reggie got zoned out by a player earlier. it was really funny
[1:29:18] <%jepupu> Blue means better than green
[1:29:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Well never get a Hulk game again
[1:29:27] <DrkJP520> ultimate destruction was wild
[1:29:32] <Belakitu> Yooooo
[1:29:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Cozy90 guess I'll see that on the vod later
[1:29:42] <Voidvas> War of The Monsters had that climbing
[1:29:48] <+happyfaceman> this UI looks like a clusterfuck
[1:30:03] <+allups> ultimate destruction was the best thing to happen to me as a kid
[1:30:08] <Belakitu> WATCH OUT WATCH OUT
[1:30:09] <+topendbuzza> ui is very gaas
[1:30:24] <%Cozy90> I agree with woolie earlier. health should be on top
[1:31:11] <%badguy8312> @woolieversus do you find pro wrestling or real fighting more entertaining as an adult?
[1:31:13] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[1:31:18] <Belakitu> So do R1 and L1 cost star meter?
[1:31:19] <Nymo> YO
[1:31:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> PogChamp
[1:31:22] <echobee_tv> That was worth it!
[1:31:23] <DeadBulky> 420 blaze it
[1:31:38] <%Cozy90> the big red machine KANE!
[1:31:39] <%king_wragles> Talk about some high damage
[1:31:40] <+SaintSalted> 420 damage woolieFROG lez go
[1:31:45] <%mr_sups> Animation in this game is so weird
[1:31:48] <Belakitu> I FRAME ROLL
[1:31:48] <%king_wragles> HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH... okay I'll leave
[1:31:50] <%jepupu> Games like this might benefit from looking behind you at times
[1:32:00] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie should have ran
[1:32:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Grab the Chicken and Run
[1:32:42] <Belakitu> Stamina might be worth the investment
[1:32:59] <scrumbotime> you burned all your stamina on moves first too, so you had like a quarter tank to run on
[1:33:05] <Qsmash_> gassed 5 minutes into the match
[1:33:24] <jKazej> 10 Attack Izuna drop
[1:33:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:33:46] <%Cozy90> i wanna see someone do a sonic boom LUL
[1:33:55] <%badguy8312> kinda sat and watched the 1v1 happen too at one point from half a meter away
[1:34:01] <+allups> are normal BR tactics useful
[1:34:04] <Belakitu> I wonder if theyll rotate in and out moves with every season
[1:34:13] <Nymo> OOOOO
[1:34:18] <Belakitu> OOOOO
[1:34:21] <VincentGraves> LOL
[1:34:26] <jKazej> Get someone off a roof top with please
[1:34:28] <%Cozy90> OK this game is awesome!
[1:34:28] <infiniteFERN> @Belakitu that's a good idea
[1:34:34] <the_ugliest_known> Yoooooooo
[1:34:39] <%badguy8312> DEVIL BRINGER???
[1:34:48] <%Double_Tap_That> Taking em down to Suplex City
[1:35:01] <%badguy8312> Kirby back throw in this ho
[1:35:14] <Mattais88> I'm a bit disappointed you can't bounce off the out of bounds ropes like G-Gundam
[1:35:18] <%Cozy90> no fall damage on jump?
[1:35:20] <Belakitu> @infiniteFERN Because the moves are effectively the weapons in this game, so it'd make sense
[1:35:24] <dan_g_v> why does he look like a giant cock?
[1:35:32] <+Lord0Mugen> the cool thing about this it actually makes you WANT TO FIGHT other players.
[1:35:33] <+DizzyGunner> i want woolie to "wooo" everytime he does a chop
[1:35:37] <dan_g_v> i mean rooster
[1:35:54] <+Lord0Mugen> whereas in the shooter BRs its all about hiding and taking pot shots.
[1:36:07] <Invess> that's that shinryu
[1:36:10] <%Cozy90> i cant wait to see some people bitching on the reddit for this game "im so sick of seeing everyone using X move. Please remove it." LUL
[1:36:13] <tomikaze_> Nice two purple moves
[1:36:25] <%badguy8312> @lord0mugen you're playing the wrong shooting BRs my friend
[1:36:26] <+N1ntend0d0> yeah i like this take of BR. No guns, just melee
[1:36:38] <+Shishi1205> A pity we wont get young goldlewis content this time
[1:36:47] <Belakitu> I like that the circle closing is faster then other BR's
[1:36:53] <@Menitta> It being just melee avoids situations of "I didn't see Kraber guy"
[1:37:12] <+DirtyMerlin> Lol this gsme is silly. Looks pretty fun tho
[1:37:13] <+allups> they style is weird but is does come together
[1:37:16] <jetjagger222> pyon sugoi
[1:37:21] <+Lord0Mugen> @badguy8312 i dont know which brs youre talking about but most of the time its best to hide and wait out the players.
[1:37:25] <Belakitu> So does yellow also boost stamina recharge rate?
[1:37:27] <@Menitta> it needs harsher shading
[1:37:37] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:37:41] <Deko_> LUL
[1:37:43] <%RyTYoung> Time to pitch the tents boys cos we’re going CAMPING
[1:37:45] <@Menitta> but otherwise it looks pretty fun
[1:38:03] <+PapermanXD> rekt shot LUL
[1:38:04] <%badguy8312> @lord0mugen apex rewards you a whole lot for thirding other people's skirmishes
[1:38:06] <+DizzyGunner> pocket chicken
[1:38:17] <+PapermanXD> def a ff10 ref now
[1:38:32] <+Lord0Mugen> @badguy8312 it also rewards you best for being ON A TEAM.
[1:38:45] <+DizzyGunner> the ultimate macho man finisher: the 100ft elbow drop
[1:38:47] <%Cozy90> 1200 floor elbow drop should be like getting sniped. instant down
[1:38:47] <+Lord0Mugen> which is ultimately Apex's biggest fairlure
[1:38:52] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[1:38:53] <%Cozy90> 100*
[1:38:56] <+Shishi1205> that lookjs sick

[1:39:02] <+Jiggisnipe> oh no
[1:39:05] <%RyTYoung> Yoooooo

[1:40:49] <linSP> live to see another day
[1:40:53] <%Cozy90> oh no

[1:41:01] <+Jiggisnipe> yea high ground is where its out
[1:41:04] <Daxalog> So this is the power of the .. glass cannon
[1:41:04] <+Jiggisnipe> at*

[1:42:57] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[1:43:09] <+ikantreeed> games looks really fun, but...i can get over how it looks NotLikeThis
[1:43:10] <+El_Rabbit> Game seems pretty neat
[1:43:33] <%therustystream> it's crazy how well the mechanics actually work for a BR
[1:43:45] <%Juriasu> @ikantreeed same it feels like fortnite but even more fortnite. It all feels so cynical
[1:43:46] <RyuuAoi> @ikantreeed Too Fortnitey?
[1:43:46] <rosemon5001> its seems you can quick attack or shield most red grabs
[1:43:56] <dan_g_v> is there a gang beast mode?
[1:44:03] <+ikantreeed> yea
[1:44:10] <Belakitu> I am loving all the different moves

[1:45:22] <%Cozy90> are chicken tendors like baby mode?
[1:45:28] <OldManDeckardCain> where we elbow dropping boys
[1:45:28] <@Menitta> This implies that boned chicken is competitive
[1:45:29] <%Juriasu> oh do you pick up moves?
[1:45:39] <Belakitu> Chicken breath dont sound pleasent
[1:45:42] <jetjagger222> yup its moves instead of weapons

[1:52:02] <Nymo> I dig it
[1:52:07] <+redthebaron> this is way better than i expected
[1:52:09] <%RyTYoung> It’s got that Fortnite font LUL
[1:52:12] <%therustystream> RPS combat in a BR actually works
[1:52:13] <jetjagger222> i miss the sound effect from tekken 3 going CHICKEN
[1:52:16] <%Juriasu> if they really did stop chicken from spawning because the test was over that would be hilarious
[1:52:23] <+Superbro64> @rytyoung it IS an epic store game LUL
[1:52:27] <%Th3rd3> the Iron Galaxy smell
[1:52:37] <%RyTYoung> @superbro64 day makes sense Kappa
[1:52:41] <infiniteFERN> @jetjagger222 lol yeah LUL
[1:52:41] <%RyTYoung> Dat
[1:52:43] <tomikaze_> I thought this game was supposed to come out today?
[1:52:46] <Nymo> I feel that
[1:52:50] <Raziel71> damn did it ended already ?
[1:52:58] <Belakitu> The style kinda fads into the back when your in it
[1:53:03] <+Shisnopi> THE  trailer made it look like a mobile game
[1:53:04] <+Superbro64> its funny to think that THIS WHOLE TIME, this is what Iron Galaxy was working on
[1:53:05] <+allups> i didn't think it looks to bad a little empty tho
[1:53:06] <jetjagger222> yeah the style kinda looks like off-brand hanna barbera
[1:53:06] <%therustystream> I wanna play more of it
[1:53:08] <+El_Rabbit> Yeah, i'm not feeling the art style too
[1:53:08] <+Shisnopi> glad its better than it loks
[1:53:11] <Jmanforever23> @jetjagger222 was in Tekken 4 too lmao
[1:53:14] <+Superbro64> since the killer instinct days
[1:53:16] <LunarRemix> Yeah they should've picked another artstyle for the characters
[1:53:19] <jetjagger222> @Jmanforever23 yeah its iconic
[1:53:23] <Bl4kDynamite> 2hrs was not enough! I need more rumble!
[1:53:25] <%therustystream> art style is whatever but it will probably ok
[1:53:33] <%TheBesteban> I'll see you at the full release.
[1:53:36] <%Juriasu> Fortnites artstyle is a an artstyle, it's not my thing buts it's all right. All these other games just straight up copying fortnites artstyle is kind of sucks
[1:53:38] <RyuuAoi> It's like WWE Superstars where the wrestlers are all weird.
[1:53:49] <+Superbro64> that cinematic trailer is literally the worst trailer for a game Ive seen in a long, LONG time @woolieversus
[1:53:50] <+ikantreeed> I genuinly feel like the art style might be the thing that could kill that game. makes it look hyper generic
[1:53:56] <Belakitu> It does have love in it
[1:54:00] <jetjagger222> or the fruity pebbles version of john cena
[1:54:08] <+Superbro64> literally made people LESS interested in the game
[1:54:09] <tomikaze_> @Juriasu Agrred
[1:54:12] <%therustystream> Fortnite has a lab lol, this game will definitely have a lab
[1:54:17] <%Juriasu> Apex has a lab so can this
[1:54:20] <%RyTYoung> Apex has a lab
[1:54:31] <%lem______> GET OUT OF THE VENUE

[1:58:00] <Carlioo> is this a new FG boom period?
[1:58:07] <jetjagger222> hopefully we get a samsho 7 if it sells well
[1:58:17] <%mr_sups> KoF is unfortuatly the enternal Second Fiddle

[1:58:59] <@Menitta> I wish I tried the beta
[1:59:30] <%mr_sups> that's fair
[1:59:31] <jetjagger222> yeah samsho was a huge leap from XIV
[1:59:40] <%livlinn> !uptime
[1:59:41] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 15 minutes
[1:59:41] <+ikantreeed> I want my 3d fighter to look like rival schools and nothing else
[1:59:43] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus are you doing kof15 on consoles or pc next week?
[1:59:55] <jetjagger222> the good thing is they don't have the weird character-to-character inconsistencies like they have in SFV
[1:59:56] <+kewlmyc> the 3D in KOFXV looks pretty decent. Looks way better than the dogshit looking KOFXIV
[2:00:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> all I know about new KOF is taht Isla is cool
[2:00:28] <jetjagger222> i liked how XV terry and andy look somewhat similar to the obari versions
[2:00:31] <@Menitta> They're getting there for sure. The thick outlines and harsher shading definitely helped define the KOF and Samsho style
[2:00:31] <@Solidus_113> massive street fighter feet
[2:00:40] <%polothegreatest> i membee original kyo 14 LUL
[2:00:53] <BlackermanZX> people who believe XV looks like XIV are huffing some copium
[2:00:54] <jetjagger222> XIV kyo looked like a totally different dude
[2:01:04] <%Juriasu> I was just thinking that too sfiv and sfv aren't the prettiest games but they have a look and the kof games just look bland
[2:01:15] <%mr_sups> It's still pretty Genero
[2:01:37] <%polothegreatest> BIG 4: KOF,SF,TK,GG woolieYE
[2:01:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Buh We Want Fortnight
[2:01:45] <BlackermanZX> XIV Shun ei looks like a crackhead
[2:01:48] <+SaurianCrash> sfv looks alot better than sflv tho
[2:01:50] <@Menitta> TOTSUGEKI
[2:01:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:01:51] <%mr_sups> Samsho had a BOLD Style. So there's hope.
[2:02:08] <@Menitta> It takes me a solid 15 minutes without Totsugeki
[2:02:10] <+ikantreeed> lmaoooo reggie hair
[2:02:17] <yukichocomilk> at that point just alt f4 and totsugeki it
[2:02:18] <Pookiedaexzile> KOF Looks Better than SFV
[2:02:36] <nintega010> Can't wait to play kof 15
[2:02:41] <jetjagger222> SFV is super inconsistent; you have banana ken in the same game as menat
[2:02:55] <@Menitta> thats a good question

[2:39:43] <marcomatame> Nago's closeS is too good man
[2:39:54] <InXplotch> I wonder if woolie is pressing because he's not sure of baiken's pressure gaps
[2:40:17] <%Juriasu> LUL
[2:40:17] <Belakitu> @badguy8312 whats the channel name?
[2:40:17] <+frogblogdogfrog> screen tear?

[2:41:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:41:31] <Bl4kDynamite> I'd have shot him Reggie
[2:42:10] <%badguy8312> inverse "good ol dp, nothing beats that"
[2:42:25] <+admiral_of_crunch> All those resources
[2:42:33] <$razielhex> well, yeah, she's a Bhuddist
[2:42:51] <InXplotch> you can grab blocked yousanzen
[2:42:53] <%badguy8312> @razielhex wait, for real?
[2:43:08] <%badguy8312> not Shintoism?
[2:43:21] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm Pretty Sure the Samurai from Japan is Christian guys
[2:43:40] <InXplotch> TK yosanzen is -15 to -18 on block depending on how it is inputted
[2:43:43] <SunsetJack> Wack
[2:43:52] <%badguy8312> @pookiedaexzile you might have a case for pastafarian
[2:43:57] <%Shad0wTag> There is no Japan in GG anymore
[2:44:10] <InXplotch> after the block you can 6p
[2:44:13] <InXplotch> I think
[2:44:18] <InXplotch> or just 5k
[2:44:21] <+SaurianCrash> theres a japan in their hearts v:
[2:44:25] <%badguy8312> @shad0wtag SHHH, don't tell Chipp! you'll ruin the MAGIC
[2:45:04] <+SaurianCrash> baiken can super when blocking
[2:45:19] <+TopTieramisu> wait, what is nago's background?
[2:45:25] <+TopTieramisu> is he another weeb?
[2:45:35] <InXplotch> nago is a weeb, yeah
[2:45:35] <cinless> nago is from the ground
[2:45:37] <Pookiedaexzile> @TopTieramisu Vampire
[2:45:43] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, a vampire weeb
[2:45:45] <+SaurianCrash> weepire
[2:45:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:45:57] <%badguy8312> @toptieramisu is he old enough to have been to non crater Japan?
[2:46:04] <$razielhex> @badguy8312 Her soundtrack is literally a Buddhist matra of light, where she would be a Shigon or Kegon Bhuddist
[2:46:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Pretty Sure Nago is from Yharnam
[2:46:17] <enerkaizer> speaking of vampires: Did we ever find out why Slayer was not involved in Strives storymode? Was there ever an explanation?
[2:46:17] <InXplotch> HAHAHAHAH
[2:46:17] <%Juriasu> LUL
[2:46:21] <InXplotch> LOL
[2:46:24] <+OrangeMDT> Yo Reggie with these moves
[2:46:27] <+frogblogdogfrog> how - is the parry?
[2:46:30] <+TopTieramisu> a japanese bloodborne game would slap
[2:46:31] <%badguy8312> double fear parry let's go
[2:46:34] <+cemoRocks> almost comeback
[2:46:35] <+TopTieramisu> japanese themed bloodborne*
[2:46:37] <InXplotch> "Ok, you just Blue RC'd and your opponent is doing charged just, what do you do?"
[2:46:41] <Pookiedaexzile> @TopTieramisu Sekiro
[2:46:44] <Carlioo> @TopTieramisu sekiro?
[2:46:47] <InXplotch> "spam a 6 fram parry ona 27 frame slowdown move.
[2:46:52] <+TopTieramisu> nah, i mean it's actually in the world of bloodborne
[2:46:59] <%badguy8312> @inxplotch pray to whatever God is listening and 6p
[2:47:04] <+capybruhArt> a bloodborne starring nago would rock

[2:47:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone Didn't beat the secrect triple hidden boss of Sekiro
[2:47:56] <InXplotch> I'm surprised how often woolie commits to fsss without fukiyo back
[2:48:06] <+TopTieramisu> speaking of which, can you make a non-creepy looking black character in elden ring?
[2:48:19] <+TopTieramisu> fromsoft doesn't have a good history with skin tones
[2:48:28] <%Juriasu> character creation loos good in elden ring so we can hope
[2:48:35] <+Shishi1205> I hope so. The char creator looks way better
[2:48:37] <+SaurianCrash> you'll have to make do
[2:48:46] <cinless> i'll be impressed if you can make non-creepy characters of any kind in elden ring
[2:48:49] <+SaurianCrash> or make a horror
[2:49:18] <+OrangeMDT> @inxplotch the rekka? You can’t special cancel from that
[2:49:41] <InXplotch> Fsss can't be canceled?
[2:49:45] <%badguy8312> @cinless vaati's stuff looks pretty normal from what I've seen
[2:50:01] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne's character creator was decent if you're going for a very european-looking character
[2:50:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie out here playing with gun control
[2:50:25] <InXplotch> oh, the third hit cant be canceled, yeah
[2:50:26] <cinless> bloodborne's character creator was decent if you wanted to make a pale, gangly spider person
[2:50:30] <$razielhex> @TopTieramisu Elden Ring needs to borrow from NBA2K16 to have black characters not look weird.  That way Woolie can Isekai Elden Ring with "THE RAGE" from Livin' Da' Dream.
[2:50:47] <+TopTieramisu> well, there's nothing you can do about bloodborne's body proportions LUL
[2:50:51] <InXplotch> which is why I'm surprised he does it without RC available
[2:50:53] <+TopTieramisu> it fits the world
[2:51:04] <Carlioo> I feel like all fromsoft created characters look like freaks in some way or another
[2:51:10] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:51:10] <%Juriasu> LUL
[2:51:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:51:14] <+OrangeMDT> @inxplotch unless there was another nago buff recently, the last hit is a frame trap that’s punishable on block
[2:51:34] <$razielhex> CUFF'D
[2:51:36] <+TopTieramisu> des remake is probably the best souls character creator so far
[2:51:39] <%badguy8312> @toptieramisu no thicc people allowed in lovecraftian nightmare realms, sad
[2:51:46] <+Fetrigon> woolie noooooo
[2:51:48] <@Menitta> damn Reggie's Baiken is oppressive
[2:51:54] <@Menitta> real nice
[2:51:57] <+TopTieramisu> @badguy8312 there's a lore reason for the weird proportions
[2:52:14] <The_Grand_J> blood makes you long
[2:52:21] <+SaurianCrash> i woulda like to test my baiken vs Reggie's
[2:52:24] <Pookiedaexzile> We need more Thiccy Old Ones
[2:52:36] <+TopTieramisu> they're getting closer to being like pthumerians
[2:52:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Tryin to get some MindFlussy
[2:53:00] <cinless> @TopTieramisu pretty sure that's pure conjecture
[2:53:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:53:01] <%badguy8312> @toptieramisu they ain't got cornbread in ancient pthumeria? /s
[2:53:01] <+TopTieramisu> ebrietas was kinda thicc
[2:53:04] <$razielhex> @Pookiedaexzile wasn't that the plot of Baldur's Gate 3?
[2:53:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @TopTieramisu but every fromsoft game has 9 head high human/player characters though
[2:53:26] <Pookiedaexzile> @Pookiedaexzile I gotta new CRPG to play
[2:53:39] <InXplotch> YOU LET GO
[2:53:40] <%badguy8312> @razielhex I've never agreed with someone so angrily before, thank you
[2:53:49] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu in what way? yharnam is literally built on top of pthumeru, who were humans that were evolving through the consumption of old blood
[2:53:50] <Estuko> @TopTieramisu saw someone do artwork of Ebrietas in a maid costume and I realized I needed to get some sleep
[2:54:15] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu other fromsoft games don't have giraffe-necked people at least
[2:54:18] <emptyantics> SATURDAY NIGHT FIGHTING BABY
[2:54:19] <InXplotch> you didnt buffer the parry, you just let go and were probably hit mid input
[2:54:33] <+cubbywolf> baiken gear strive
[2:54:37] <%yves_is_online> yves_is_online subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:54:38] <$razielhex> gosh that reach with the red sword
[2:55:01] <%badguy8312> piss stream Sam hours
[2:55:02] <InXplotch> parry deez
[2:55:22] <$razielhex> the only thing that can face a Baiken is a Bairyu
[2:55:34] <+TopTieramisu> or baikuma
[2:55:37] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> SophiaAmoreaVeritas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Happy Weekend to two of the coolest people in the internet! <3
[2:55:44] <@Menitta> just installed the Vergil colors for Baiken lets go
[2:56:13] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like nero would be a better comparison to baiken
[2:56:18] <$razielhex> Baikuma uses her phantom arm to unlock the dark powers
[2:56:36] <%badguy8312> @toptieramisu Nero fucking wishes
[2:56:40] <+cubbywolf> biaken is Nero and Virgil combined with two beach balls
[2:56:44] <@Menitta> I'll take what Gamebanana gives
[2:56:46] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:56:49] <+TopTieramisu> they're both missing an arm... for a while at least
[2:56:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Calling that a Hood Perfect
[2:57:17] <+TopTieramisu> and nero literally gets man-made tools to replace his arm in 5
[2:57:43] <$razielhex> I'm not cuffed to you, YOU'RE CUFFED TO ME.
[2:58:17] <%badguy8312> so, what the fuck is Baiken hitting you with when she youzansens?
[2:58:29] <Carlioo> you can't have two tethers up right? I assume it'd be pointless
[2:58:39] <+TopTieramisu> two baikens can tether each other
[2:59:04] <cinless> i think if two baikens tether each other they are common law married, legally
[2:59:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:59:18] <Pookiedaexzile> That was a" first to shoot wis a bitch" moment
[2:59:27] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:59:36] <+OrangeMDT> Yooo that conversion
[2:59:39] <+TopTieramisu> i wish if baiken wall broke someone while tethered, there'd be a special animation where she's dragged with them as they fly away
[3:00:12] <+TopTieramisu> completely superfluous detail, obviously
[3:00:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:00:28] <$razielhex> is that some zettai ryouiki?
[3:00:35] <+TopTieramisu> GUN

[3:00:49] <$razielhex> Blunderbussy
[3:00:51] <+TopTieramisu> channeling her inner sword saint
[3:01:38] <+SaurianCrash> rope jumping back dashing back while tethered
[3:01:50] <%badguy8312> meowriiiGun meowriiiGun meowriiiGun meowriiiGun meowriiiGun
[3:02:11] <Carlioo> has reggie used the gun super once?
[3:02:24] <%badguy8312> I think he Whiffed it last match
[3:02:33] <$razielhex> have they ever showed Baiken's nub?  Like where the arm was severed?  Is it at the shoulder?  Half a humerus?
[3:02:40] <$razielhex> elbow?
[3:02:47] <+SaurianCrash> shoulder
[3:02:57] <+TopTieramisu> forearm or upper arm?
[3:03:03] <+SaurianCrash> or upper
[3:03:33] <%Juriasu> G U N
[3:04:08] <cinless> this is why i will never learn any character other than potemkin
[3:04:39] <%badguy8312> @cinless the glue industry thanks you
[3:04:48] <+TopTieramisu> so how bad is the baiken pot matchup?
[3:04:50] <kikoeru_san> less that and more, "dash is motion" brain because Nago
[3:05:20] <cinless> @badguy8312 get up off the ground and say that to my face
[3:05:25] <+SaurianCrash> not that
[3:05:31] <+SaurianCrash> bad

[3:10:46] <+Shishi1205> Some baiken mains run on ram neurons. Wake up super all day
[3:10:49] <%badguy8312> shit, imagine a soulsborne fighting game
[3:10:51] <%oneimportantthing> So is Woolie or Reggie the better player? Or are they equals
[3:11:06] <+anoldtoilet> theyre pretty close
[3:11:11] <+anoldtoilet> usually play different characters
[3:11:14] <+TopTieramisu> @badguy8312 a soul calibur without questionable character designs? yes please
[3:11:20] <%oneimportantthing> @badguy8312 I want Bloodborne Kart first though

[3:11:40] <%SirGO0SE> yeah both woolie and reggie are real good
[3:11:51] <%SirGO0SE> reggie surprises me with just how apt he is to picking things up too
[3:11:52] <cinless> just put gherman in tekken
[3:11:57] <%badguy8312> @oneimportantthing what would drive besides the player character insane?
[3:12:01] <cinless> or gascoigne
[3:12:10] <Pookiedaexzile> @TopTieramisu Ivy will be never be clothed you villian
[3:12:28] <%oneimportantthing> @badguy8312 I really wanna see The One Reborn fit into a cart lol
[3:12:37] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i wasn't even thinking about that. i mean goofy designs like maxi
[3:12:52] <Pookiedaexzile> The One Reborn is his own cart
[3:13:02] <%badguy8312> @oneimportantthing just have some of the arms hold wheels yeah
[3:13:24] <%oneimportantthing> Soul Calibur Ivy was straight up just a dev deciding not to jerk off before drawing her design
[3:13:34] <+TopTieramisu> don't forget taki with her boob socks
[3:13:42] <%SirGO0SE> oooo Woolie was playing Nago earlier? how did he look?
[3:13:53] <%Shad0wTag> Her alternates always have her clothed

[3:17:39] <%oneimportantthing> Castlevania and Silent Hill are the main reason someone needs to just buy Konami already
[3:17:50] <%mr_sups> GUN
[3:17:51] <slipdog> @SirGO0SE that and break a spell are probably the last two i will never get LUL
[3:17:51] <styptysat> LUL
[3:18:02] <+anoldtoilet> its sad konami is bad at handling all their classic amazing ips
[3:18:12] <slipdog> Konami DansGame DansGame
[3:18:17] <slipdog> fuckem
[3:18:32] <%badguy8312> @anoldtoilet you mean the pachinko company? /s
[3:18:34] <+Shishi1205> the random music mod unlocks all the songs btw
[3:18:35] <slipdog> give platinum another rising tho

[3:18:52] <%oneimportantthing> Yo
[3:18:57] <+TopTieramisu> let's be honest. silent hill has been dying slowly for a long ass time
[3:19:09] <slipdog> PT cancellation was the final nail
[3:19:12] <$razielhex> silent hill is stuck in silent hill
[3:19:14] <+anoldtoilet> parrying supers is too crazy.
[3:19:14] <$razielhex> metahill
[3:19:15] <+Shishi1205> you can pot buster baiken between hits 2 and 3 of her super if you Ib
[3:19:15] <+TopTieramisu> hills could have been something special but we'll never know
[3:19:16] <%Juriasu> Konami doesn't care about their games, they just release some shitty ones sometimes so they can pretend they are a game company
[3:19:30] <$razielhex> y'all heard of Pachinko?
[3:19:39] <PleaseStayLucid> You can also just put in the parry during the freeze at any point and it will work if you were blocking.
[3:19:40] <%oneimportantthing> @toptieramisu true, and only Kojima has the indie weirdness to actually pull off anything remotely like Team Silent did
[3:19:55] <slipdog> pachinko got rekt during covid, games industry booming. you get what you fucking deserve konami
[3:20:07] <%SirGO0SE> lil kyle
[3:20:15] <+jordy_j_s> are they fighting each other?

[3:20:18] <$razielhex> pachinko NFTs from virtual gacha machines
[3:20:19] <teflonbilly777> I picked this up on sale, but have so many games on my backlist I haven't had time to immerse myself in it. I think I've spent more time watching lewd vids of Jack-O and Baiken on YoutUbe than actually playing Strive yet
[3:20:28] <slipdog> @jordy_j_s nah this co-op
[3:20:30] <%Juriasu> @razielhex NotLikeThis
[3:20:34] <teflonbilly777> And now I'm knee-deep in Sifu!

[3:20:37] <%SirGO0SE> @teflonbilly777 youre halfway there
[3:20:46] <%oneimportantthing> If Microsoft buys Konami and throws endless money at Kojumbo to make Silent Hills i'll buy their xbox
[3:20:46] <+TopTieramisu> ah shit, what if konami made a new bloody roar
[3:20:58] <+elderpunch> @jordy_j_s LUL

[3:22:18] <+Demoli_PT> nago got back teleport to bait with
[3:22:42] <teflonbilly777> I think I borked my brain back in the day by picking up Blazblue and GG Xrd at the same time
[3:22:45] <%SirGO0SE> with ram i suppose i can burst bait by just doing rekka 1 then blocking
[3:22:52] <%badguy8312> got doinked
[3:22:54] <+SaurianCrash> @TopTieramisu right, Beast Riser just to redo it xD
[3:23:04] <PleaseStayLucid> any fast button into block works for baits as well
[3:23:12] <+Shishi1205> @SirGO0SE allmost all ram combos are not burstable
[3:23:17] <+anoldtoilet> yeah if your opp. has burst, make them think you're going for the big combo and block instead
[3:23:26] <+anoldtoilet> good times are the first time you get someone in the corner
[3:23:26] <+Shishi1205> that char is a war crime against the wall

[3:58:12] <@Menitta> eyy Irridium in the lobby
[3:58:14] <GenericSoda> nah, cheer for Goldlewis imo
[3:58:21] <SofterCrash> maybe we should move over one machine so the guys in the back don't get confused??
[3:58:22] <+Shishi1205> Tethering goldlewis is not a good idea btw
[3:58:34] <%Irridium> @Menitta bro this a dirty-ass line lmao
[3:58:35] <%townzzzzz> MASSISVE
[3:58:35] <+Shishi1205> he can combo down the system

[3:59:24] <CommandantKobold> DEFENSE
[3:59:26] <SofterCrash> i wouldn't like to be in there
[3:59:28] <TimetodiveLTX> banged ass song
[3:59:36] <@Menitta> I appreciate everyone using the honor system of this line
[3:59:40] <SofterCrash> that's a lot of people clipping over each other
[3:59:52] <slipdog> evrybody utilize the buddy system
[3:59:54] <%SirGO0SE> @Menitta chat loves the sanctity of the line
[4:00:04] <%Irridium> got my booster earlier and starting to feel it but I figured fuck it I'll jump on and mash some buttons
[4:00:08] <GenericSoda> I can't remember the bot sajam uses to manage his line but in his twitch chat there's a bot that manages it
[4:00:08] <%townzzzzz> wow
[4:00:11] <TimetodiveLTX> ok
[4:00:14] <InXplotch> id rather bot queue but what can you do
[4:00:15] <@Menitta> This is part of the reason I made my avatar Doug Dimmadome
[4:00:16] <DrunkenDice> that was sick
[4:00:23] <+RustyCoyoteA> I love Goldlewis’ title, design  and theme. It’s the weird Venn diagram of America, Japan and America lol
[4:00:25] <joefromsingapore> wow
[4:00:32] <SyLuX45> Welp Baiken is getting probed
[4:00:32] <%Irridium> @Menitta you do stick out that's for sure
[4:00:34] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta Im the floating happy chaos
[4:00:37] <+RustyCoyoteA> Guilty gear*
[4:00:42] <SyLuX45> pickyRekt
[4:00:53] <@Menitta> Happy Chaos's hat is also good
[4:01:25] <+RustyCoyoteA> I had to relearn the game after playing Gio for so long
[4:01:44] <+anoldtoilet> yeah nago is unikque
[4:01:48] <+Demoli_PT> we taker those
[4:02:00] <slipdog> yeh i decided im gonna learn every character before pushing celestial to avoid that problem
[4:02:09] <%SirGO0SE> girls just wanna 2k 2d
[4:02:09] <HotSauceFiend> So a question from someone who hasn't played GG. Does this game have a small moveset or is this normal. Cause just comparing it to KOF, it seems like KOF movesets is bigger
[4:02:10] <SyLuX45> I guess all the Faust players gave up on him
[4:02:21] <slipdog> wanna make sure im not too carried
[4:02:41] <+Shishi1205> How was the ping btw? @WoolieVersus I hope it wasn't too noticeable.
[4:02:42] <GenericSoda> @SyLuX45 Faust is fine right now
[4:02:48] <+RustyCoyoteA> @slipdog not a bad idea. Gives you a chance to learn character weakness and strengths as well
[4:02:51] <+Superbro64> @hotsaucefiend moveset depends on the character. Generally Strive movesets are smaller then Xrd.
[4:02:56] <InXplotch> gg
[4:02:58] <%SirGO0SE> I like the bnb's Inx was using, you pick a lot of simpler routes
[4:03:15] <%SirGO0SE> i should take notes
[4:03:18] <InXplotch> I am a smooth headed ram player so I go for very basic routes
[4:03:22] <@Menitta> Strive to me now is mostly the game I play with friends. hi don't try to push Celestial
[4:03:26] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i also consume glue
[4:03:33] <@Menitta> plus I know I'm not good enough lmao
[4:03:56] <%SirGO0SE> Ram's on parade PogChamp
[4:03:57] <%Irridium> anytime I want to get into celestial I just find a couple potempkins to bully as axl
[4:03:58] <GenericSoda> @Menitta look if I can make celestial you absolutely can
[4:04:12] <@Menitta> Lmao
[4:04:13] <GenericSoda> I just want to eat hot chip, do fuujin, lie, and wakeup counter super and I made it
[4:04:17] <@Menitta> I guess I should try
[4:04:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> UNF, I love this Baiken color
[4:04:26] <%Bin_VV> Lotta Rams out here today huh
[4:04:28] <%Irridium> though this month I got in through honest baiken matches so that was nice
[4:04:34] <%SirGO0SE> i started on floor 5 and will probably get my first celestial challenge this week. been bouncing between 10-9
[4:04:36] <+Superbro64> the tower system in general sucks, depending on your performance you zig zag between floors, which interrupt sets
[4:04:43] <+Superbro64> quite frustrating to experience
[4:04:43] <+RustyCoyoteA> @menitta honestly I’m in the same boat. I’m slowly getting better but not pushing it. I’m end up falling up and down floor 8-10 lol
[4:04:45] <InXplotch> @WoolieVersus you do have to be careful if you're watching celestial games of baiken because the skill range is very huge at the moment
[4:05:05] <@Menitta> I was messing around in the combo searcher earlier today and it made me feel like I'm terrible at video games
[4:05:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[4:05:23] <GenericSoda> @SirGO0SE hell yeah, let's go
[4:05:29] <@Menitta> At least Millia has some insanely small windows
[4:05:29] <+OrangeMDT> I don’t know how to get into this line baccpaLFG
[4:05:32] <+Shishi1205> I vary between floors 8-9-10
[4:05:39] <+Superbro64> tower system also can have you be sweaty with matchups, I dont have many chances to stick in Celestial, so Im not gonna play a bad matchup
[4:05:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:05:51] <InXplotch> good strat
[4:05:51] <%SirGO0SE> based LUL
[4:05:53] <+Shishi1205> Some MU's smoke me bc Its the first time I play them
[4:05:54] <DrunkenDice> lacXD
[4:05:59] <GenericSoda> I feel like the floor system is fine, but ironically it's Celestial that's kind of borked
[4:06:07] <marcomatame> amma be real the japanese built different
[4:06:09] <@Menitta> Also everyone in the line try to condense forward to the person in front as much as you can so it's an even spread
[4:06:13] <+Shishi1205> Also Ky, he's difficult for me
[4:06:13] <GenericSoda> and that's because Celestial is made up of "people who just rolled in from floor 10" and "Hotashi"
[4:06:18] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE romollaBlessed
[4:06:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Japanese Name but its a kid from florida witta fucked up line up
[4:06:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> あるいく close enough?

[4:06:46] <someduden> you was somedude, sorry if my internet was garbage, was streaming the game, also yea was garbage in that match
[4:06:52] <%SirGO0SE> GGPlayer is to be feared

[4:14:50] <Ragnorok64> Thanks. I had to look at the clip replay to make sure the facecam actually shrunk. I looked away for a set then looked back and I thought it looked smaller.
[4:14:55] <slipdog> ppl were giving me grief for playing baiken so i learned axl out of spite

[4:22:17] <Heefnoff> Leo for sure
[4:22:17] <GenericSoda> @shin_phil I think Hotashi's top 5 was Chaos, Sol, Nago, Zato, and somebody I can't remember
[4:22:20] <AngryAsian5> Everhood defeated TWICE LUL
[4:22:20] <+shin_phil> i think she doesnt hit the same ceiling as Nago and HC but shes probably the easiest of the top tier characters

[4:29:17] <Furtive_Vulpine> chipp has had it rough before in the series but hes pretty good in strive
[4:29:18] <+shin_phil> chipp is pretty good rn
[4:29:23] <+anoldtoilet> gg im bad
[4:29:25] <+shin_phil> there honestly isnt a bad charactrer in the game
[4:29:32] <+Demoli_PT> he really isn't
[4:29:37] <marcomatame> Chipp aint Bad at all, he could be a bit better though
[4:29:37] <+shin_phil> game doesnt duck beneath A tier
[4:29:42] <+Demoli_PT> he got poower crept real bad
[4:29:46] <GenericSoda> I would say Anji is the worst character in the game and he is completely viable
[4:29:48] <+Shishi1205> I don't think Chipp is that good
[4:29:59] <+RustyCoyoteA> @shin_phil I agree. I don’t think people know how bad a character can really be lol
[4:30:01] <+Demoli_PT> badness is always relative
[4:30:01] <+eanscrale> He's not as strong as in Xrd, but he still gets to do his thing
[4:30:02] <+Shishi1205> At least in the tier list
[4:30:05] <+Demoli_PT> he's not unplayable
[4:30:09] <+Demoli_PT> in any aspect
[4:30:21] <+Shishi1205> Nah no one is "bad" in strive
[4:30:25] <+Demoli_PT> but hes behind most of the cast
[4:30:28] <TimetodiveLTX> i am a chipp downplayer (frustrated)
[4:30:30] <+Demoli_PT> and that makes him bad
[4:30:48] <$razielhex> whiff
[4:30:50] <GenericSoda> if a character still gets to play the game, run their tools, and succeed, they're not bad
[4:30:58] <GenericSoda> we're not talking about Xrd Potemkin here
[4:31:12] <marcomatame> Chipp's got great tools that dont deal a lot of return, that and low HP are his quirks
[4:31:28] <+Demoli_PT> as i said, badness is a spectrum
[4:31:31] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 39 in the channel! 
[4:31:32] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly gifted a Tier 1 sub to slipdog! 
[4:31:32] <+Demoli_PT> if you are on the lower end, thats bad
[4:31:35] <TimetodiveLTX> i wouldn't pick him up again
[4:31:44] <+Demoli_PT> he's still fun mind you
[4:31:44] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 40 in the channel! 
[4:31:45] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly gifted a Tier 1 sub to pandasaremellow! 
[4:31:47] <%slipdog> yo good lookin woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[4:31:47] <+Demoli_PT> i'll always play him
[4:31:53] <+Demoli_PT> but it is what it is
[4:31:59] <%slipdog> i will not let it go to waste thats for sure thank you
[4:31:59] <+shin_phil> chipps offense is still suffocating. He isnt bad by any means, I do think if we're talking comp though he is *harder*
[4:32:04] <marcomatame> idk how you would go about buffing Chipp other than a real slight damage increase
[4:32:07] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> GG's ya'll!
[4:32:18] <+Demoli_PT> they gotta buff his midscreen presence
[4:32:22] <+Shishi1205> Im surpised about the ping tbh
[4:32:29] <+Demoli_PT> thats his worst thing
[4:32:31] <$razielhex> chipp
[4:32:38] <%townzzzzz> faster FASTER
[4:32:38] <TimetodiveLTX> let me control j.2k in the air for better left rights
[4:32:43] <+Shishi1205> 3 rollback frames from Eu is super good
[4:32:43] <GenericSoda> if they make his midscreen too strong though that's a problem
[4:32:49] <+Demoli_PT> like, not memeing here
[4:32:52] <+Demoli_PT> he needs his teleports back
[4:32:59] <+shin_phil> he doesnt
[4:33:08] <+Shishi1205> lmao shuriken'd on
[4:33:09] <$razielhex> ran it back
[4:33:09] <GenericSoda> I don't think he needs them back in Strive
[4:33:22] <GenericSoda> that's like saying Anji needs his old 6K back or something
[4:33:29] <marcomatame> EAT WIND SHURIKEN
[4:33:38] <GenericSoda> Damn the crossup?
[4:33:42] <+shin_phil> actually no you know what im switching teams
[4:33:43] <Ragnorok64> what was that hitbox?
[4:33:48] <+Demoli_PT> no, removing tp is like removing millia disc, you change the whole character, and old k alpha was what it was to concpensate for that
[4:33:51] <%townzzzzz> maybe he has 4K on
[4:33:51] <+shin_phil> baiken needs plus r guard cancel back
[4:34:00] <+shin_phil> lets play this game lmao
[4:34:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:34:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> bruh
[4:34:15] <GenericSoda> @shin_phil bring back Rev 1.0 Raven imo
[4:34:16] <+eanscrale> I don't think Baiken will get any of those +R tools back
[4:34:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> that was weird
[4:34:29] <+eanscrale> could you imagine turning off someone's button in this game?
[4:34:31] <gryffinp> bring back susano'o
[4:34:32] <$razielhex> glass bones
[4:34:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> east coast usa
[4:34:36] <+shin_phil> @eanscrale of course not
[4:34:37] <+Demoli_PT> yeah i think at best baiken will get some rev2 stuff
[4:34:48] <+shin_phil> nah baikens not getting any of that stuff
[4:34:50] <Afrosamasenpai> pot bois pot bois pot bois
[4:34:52] <%Irridium> east coast like northeast or florida?
[4:34:54] <GenericSoda> Potemkin's here make some noise sajamNoise
[4:34:57] <%townzzzzz> WE AIN'T IN THE FUTURE
[4:35:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Irridium NE
[4:35:03] <GenericSoda> get hype whenever Potemkin lands a command grab
[4:35:04] <stormhawk9891> ReVOREger
[4:35:06] <+shin_phil> strive baiken is strive baiken, not plus R or XRD baiken
[4:35:07] <%Irridium> damn
[4:35:08] <+Shishi1205> Let's go brethern
[4:35:11] <DrunkenDice> in pot we trust sarueiPray
[4:35:16] <$razielhex> stop jumpking in Potemkin
[4:35:22] <+shin_phil> gotta play the game as it is and not look for them to give tools back from xrd
[4:35:25] <TimetodiveLTX> i played baiken in +R and i'm glad her alpha counters are gone
[4:35:32] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @shin_phil spittin facts lets go
[4:35:35] <ExpressNode> Who's who?
[4:35:38] <gryffinp> shuut
[4:35:40] <+RustyCoyoteA> Yeah I know one of those servers in the NE US can be super finicky. With that said my connection to Mexico is fantastic
[4:35:44] <%slipdog> woolies bikin
[4:35:52] <$razielhex> @ExpressNode Get into Baiken games
[4:36:00] <+Demoli_PT> nah i'll always advocate for more tools, that shit is great
[4:36:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Normally my connection is flawless, never had a bad drop
[4:36:11] <+Shishi1205> rip
[4:36:17] <gryffinp> clean
[4:36:21] <%townzzzzz> I just want riot stamp back
[4:36:22] <GenericSoda> potemkin lost Residentsleeper
[4:36:24] <+princearthura> is that little v playing??
[4:36:36] <ExpressNode> Oh wow I didn't know she had one arm
[4:36:37] <$razielhex> no
[4:36:37] <GenericSoda> @townzzzzz Riot Stomp has got to have the most raw name of any special move I can think of
[4:36:39] <+Shishi1205> js is hard for pot
[4:36:49] <InXplotch> didn't bin already play?
[4:37:11] <+Shishi1205> @InXplotch we are 2nd rounding some of us bc we started first
[4:37:13] <%Revorger> @WoolieVersus Thank you so much for the match!
[4:37:13] <%slipdog> if it was early enough the line was short enough to be back on by now unless thats illegal
[4:37:21] <+princearthura> Oh only knew the song from his cover
[4:37:28] <gryffinp> ah, strive ramlethal
[4:37:29] <InXplotch> oh, we're allowed to get back in line?
[4:37:34] <+Shishi1205> @InXplotch ofc
[4:37:35] <+Demoli_PT> yeah of course
[4:37:51] <InXplotch> that does not seem like an obvious thing, lol
[4:37:58] <$razielhex> nice dodge
[4:38:05] <+Demoli_PT> if youa re willing to wait for more why not
[4:38:12] <+RustyCoyoteA> Yep. Saw the counter
[4:38:16] <+tkzhyon> yo wools
[4:38:25] <%townzzzzz> let's go butt
[4:38:31] <%Shad0wTag> He might be new and not know
[4:38:36] <%Bin_VV> GGs
[4:38:46] <%slipdog> i feel like even with the good online that parry window is sus
[4:38:47] <+shin_phil> Baiken hiragi is rough to time if you arent labbing it a bunch
[4:38:48] <InXplotch> my assumption is that everyone goes once so that the most number of people can have a go
[4:39:00] <+BignanasTheGawd> never parry dolphin, its not worth it
[4:39:01] <+shin_phil> its not really Sus so much as that its a proper parry
[4:39:02] <marcomatame> blue waters blue sky is too good man
[4:39:12] <+Demoli_PT> blue waters blue skyis a goat for sure
[4:39:15] <+Shishi1205> @InXplotch The lobby is not full so you can get your rerun most likely, we are doing BO1
[4:39:16] <+Demoli_PT> her best tune
[4:39:19] <%townzzzzz> BIG AIR NORMALS
[4:39:20] <+shin_phil> as opposed to a parry stance or staet
[4:39:23] <+shirou_kokkan> definitely the goat
[4:39:28] <+yeknomlive> lmao reggie's face
[4:39:30] <%Shad0wTag> Oof
[4:39:33] <%slipdog> @shin_phil its just sus hitting a 1-2 frame window online, im sure if my local scene wasnt dead id be hitting it PoroSad
[4:39:35] <+Demoli_PT> oooh that didnt chip
[4:39:36] <wawila> I'm in danger
[4:39:42] <+shin_phil> nah not really
[4:39:43] <InXplotch> landing yosanzen is very hard to be plus
[4:39:45] <+shin_phil> not with RB
[4:39:50] <+shin_phil> its also not a 1-2 frame window
[4:39:52] <InXplotch> usually you're like -2 or -3 and will be grabbed
[4:39:59] <+shin_phil> 6 frame active parry
[4:40:06] <+shin_phil> its very doable
[4:40:18] <TimetodiveLTX> OH GOD
[4:40:18] <+shin_phil> unless youre playing in like 150 ms or smth lmao
[4:40:23] <InXplotch> THE REVERSAL GUN
[4:40:24] <%townzzzzz> gun to the face
[4:40:24] <InXplotch> BLAM BLAM
[4:40:26] <%slipdog> i heard 4 and then someone corrected that to 2 so im glad to hear 6 lol
[4:40:28] <DrunkenDice> only gun can stop a dolphin
[4:40:37] <%slipdog> and nah i dont rematch over like 80 ping
[4:40:38] <TimetodiveLTX> strive is a horror game
[4:40:48] <+shin_phil> no then its 100% doable
[4:40:52] <+shin_phil> it just takes some practice
[4:40:56] <@Menitta> a turn based horror game
[4:40:57] <%slipdog> comforting.
[4:41:01] <+Shishi1205> Bro some people are still playing on 4k
[4:41:01] <+shin_phil> tbf if it was free baiken would delete strive offense
[4:41:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[4:41:12] <+Shishi1205> Counterhits make the rollback frames spike
[4:41:16] <InXplotch> the 2 p
[4:41:17] <DrunkenDice> gg
[4:41:43] <@Menitta> they really need to fix that 4k issue
[4:42:08] <InXplotch> it is crazy that people still palying aren't aware of it
[4:42:15] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta I get whiplashed when the oponets has it
[4:42:21] <InXplotch> I've had people in celestial with the bug I do not understand
[4:42:35] <%slipdog> what is the bug ? for a week 1 noob?
[4:42:41] <%mr_sups> I wish they added stuff like the UP claw and other missing moves
[4:42:43] <%slipdog> oh just dont play 4k?
[4:42:48] <+Shishi1205> @slipdog ye
[4:42:57] <InXplotch> yes, just dont play 4k
[4:43:05] <InXplotch> and you will not have MASSIVE lag on big counterhits
[4:43:25] <%slipdog> me who has rx 580: oh for sure i'll keep that in mind
[4:43:34] <%slipdog> dangO
[4:43:45] <+shin_phil> in the defense of people still playing in 4k they said they were gonna try to fix it week 1 lol
[4:43:54] <%townzzzzz> got me good
[4:43:55] <InXplotch> vortex is also WAY more negative
[4:44:01] <InXplotch> stroke is soemtimes plus
[4:44:14] <+Demoli_PT> long stroke is plus
[4:44:16] <InXplotch> vortex is also a mid while stroke is a low
[4:44:17] <+Demoli_PT> short is minus
[4:44:23] <%Shad0wTag> POTBOIS
[4:44:24] <InXplotch> if I recall correctly
[4:44:26] <ExpressNode> Shit I need to sell some of my old gpus
[4:44:26] <%Bin_VV> It's not unreasonable to think that they might add news moves to characters in future updates
[4:44:32] <%slipdog> whats the tell? the little bolt thing im assuming?
[4:44:35] <%Bin_VV> Just look at Faust
[4:45:02] <$razielhex> TOTSUMECHY
[4:45:06] <+shin_phil> its not entirely unreasonable but if youre holding out on your main getting plus r and xrd tools back youre on some omega copium
[4:45:10] <@Menitta> I double dipped on PC strive and I had no idea about the 4k issue until it became a problem
[4:45:11] <+Vimyis> POTEMKIN GLORY
[4:45:11] <SyLuX45> I wouldn’t call the new Faust addition has a new move
[4:45:16] <+Vimyis> GO FOR THE HEAVENLY
[4:45:40] <Furtive_Vulpine> pot knows his stuff
[4:45:42] <%Shad0wTag> I'm not as a Pot main what moves I could reasonbly want lytEYES
[4:45:48] <PrettiestPwny> the devs *have* said that they'd eventually like to get every old character in
[4:46:00] <PrettiestPwny> but it's likely not going to keep getting updates that long
[4:46:13] <+shin_phil> idk we're on year 4 of DBFZ
[4:46:22] <+Demoli_PT> i'd expect at least 3 seasons
[4:46:25] <+shin_phil> and SFV has been getting updates since i was in highscool
[4:46:32] <PrettiestPwny> Baiken will never get guard cancels :(
[4:46:39] <+Shishi1205> Got smoked gg
[4:46:43] <TimetodiveLTX> nice
[4:46:48] <PrettiestPwny> give Baiken baku
[4:46:53] <PrettiestPwny> she needs it
[4:47:00] <+shin_phil> this game is gonna be around for awhile most likely
[4:47:14] <PrettiestPwny> I'd guess at least 6 years
[4:47:23] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Just so you know pot can megafist before you do tatami
[4:47:26] <TimetodiveLTX> damn that line reallyis long

[4:53:57] <%SirGO0SE> we can help you with that
[4:54:00] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah that's the tech
[4:54:02] <TigerClaws12> nightbot has that feature
[4:54:06] <@Menitta> Oh yeah some people have that. I can look into that
[4:54:07] <TimetodiveLTX> i should have known someone else did that
[4:54:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Danks, Menitta
[4:54:18] <+RustyCoyoteA> IIRC Sagan does that?
[4:54:18] <+shin_phil> you could do that and then also host a lobby, so the line doesnt become unreadable
[4:54:24] <+Jack8274> If only this game had a real online mode, it's sadly the main reason I didn't pick this up
[4:54:28] <+RustyCoyoteA> Sajam *
[4:54:33] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Nightbot has that
[4:54:35] <TimetodiveLTX> sagan
[4:54:35] <@Menitta> It's a bot in Chat
[4:54:35] <%slipdog> Carl Sajam
[4:54:41] <$razielhex> how many fighting game characters can y'all think of that are left-handed, besides Baiken who doesn't really have a choice?
[4:54:44] <+JustToWatch> it's what Sajam and Deb use
[4:54:49] <+Jack8274> A simple, "Play Ranked" button against a random person... What a dream
[4:54:50] <TigerClaws12> sajam uses a custom bot because Nightbot wasn't working in his chat @WoolieVersus
[4:54:50] <%Giothegame> Would also let people do their own matches in the room too
[4:54:52] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Btw tips on the Pot mu as Baiken. Pot can megafist before tatami comes out in the string.
[4:54:55] <%slipdog> sajamHoop
[4:55:00] <chaos2frozen> Yo storyteller!
[4:55:09] <+RustyCoyoteA> @slipdog good ole Carl Sajam. The FGC scientist
[4:55:12] <%AyotoCorp> @Menitta Check out Multiqueue from the Crowd Control people
[4:55:25] <+shin_phil> @Jack8274 game has a real online mode. you just standby in training and it auto queues you. if thats your reason for not copping then lmao my man
[4:55:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:55:41] <TimetodiveLTX> i think dark night actually is from oceania 4
[4:55:43] <chaos2frozen> Sorry I mean “big blast sonic” lol
[4:55:45] <@Menitta> @ayotocorp whisper me that and I'll check it after my match
[4:55:53] <+Shishi1205> @TimetodiveLTX yeah I suspect it too
[4:56:15] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> not many @razielhex I know this cause I'm lefthanded and am biased to lefty's in games lol
[4:56:16] <+Jack8274> @shin_phil Sadly, if that was good enough, the game would have more than 2500 people playing

[5:12:54] <%Irridium> yeah subs can post links
[5:13:40] <+shin_phil> yeah
[5:13:46] <+Demoli_PT> they eventually return
[5:13:48] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> seems that way yeah
[5:13:54] <+nobotie> Time still passes while the parry is happening.
[5:14:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[5:14:10] <%Shishi1205> crossed up
[5:14:11] <+shin_phil> sword was already floating over and parry killed alot of time
[5:14:15] <%SirGO0SE> you thought
[5:14:15] <FaxineiroDePosto> yoooooo largest brain
[5:14:16] <InXplotch> she might've been thrown into the sword, or the timer might've finished by then. The timers is shorter the closer she is to her sword
[5:14:17] <BlackermanZX> YOU THOUGHT
[5:14:20] <TetraBanshee> I got it clipped and the swing around on the parry TOTALLY gave her sword back
[5:14:40] <%Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus https://youtu.be/HSxUO8KLnbA?t=21775 the fab vs kazu
[5:14:43] <marcomatame> lessgo arome
[5:14:48] <marcomatame> get his ass
[5:15:16] <InXplotch> that does happen though
[5:15:20] <+shin_phil> I ALSO WANNA SAY that sword returning while getting thrown is a bug thats been in the game since launch. Everytime they fix it a new version appears so it couldve also been that
[5:15:33] <+MinoMiushi> Unlimited Blade Works
[5:15:40] <%Shad0wTag> ALONE IINFECTION
[5:15:42] <InXplotch> you can pick up trumpet by being dragged through it like with fausts scalpel grab thing
[5:15:48] <+nobotie> @shin_phil Is it really a bug, then? Or is someone on the dev team a secret ram main?
[5:15:50] <+Superbro64> we in the critical analysis community call that "emergent gameplay" my friend
[5:15:51] <+Superbro64> Kappa
[5:16:07] <+nobotie> A gat.
[5:16:10] <InXplotch> a musket
[5:16:10] <%Shishi1205> Yeah a firework gun
[5:16:13] <InXplotch> but really a gat
[5:16:14] <%slipdog> noob tube
[5:16:32] <%mr_sups> No one can see the COLORS BUT YOU!
[5:16:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:16:41] <+shin_phil> @shin_phil its a bug. ive labbed it pretty extensively since i used to play Ram. its been present in every major version except the baiken patch
[5:16:58] <%Bin_VV> Damn Woolie taunting out here
[5:17:01] <+shin_phil> nah we all gotta taunt woolie now
[5:17:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[5:17:07] <@Menitta> the CONFIDENCE
[5:17:12] <InXplotch> During round ends sometimes you get weird inputs on the buttons
[5:17:12] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I can't believe it
[5:17:13] <%Shishi1205> Its getting late but I hope my reflexes are still good
[5:17:14] <BlackermanZX> no BM huh Keepo
[5:17:17] <+nobotie> Taunting accidentally is the worst. It makes me feel so bad when I do it by mistake.
[5:17:19] <%Bin_VV> This guy Kappa
[5:17:20] <TetraBanshee> the parry into taunt typical toxic baiken
[5:17:20] <Afrosamasenpai> Confidence so strong you taunted
[5:17:23] <Aussie_Manny> woolieEVIL "I totally meant to BM."
[5:17:24] <+Superbro64> isnt taunt like a macro?
[5:17:25] <%townzzzzz> BAIKEN IS DON'T CARE
[5:17:27] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> lmao
[5:17:28] <%Shishi1205> jab
[5:17:29] <InXplotch> My slash heavy slash becomes punch sometimes
[5:17:30] <%SirGO0SE> toxic D:
[5:17:30] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus on game end, the game controls revert to factory default after the flash
[5:17:31] <hakumaribo> how newbie friendly is Baiken?
[5:17:35] <+Demoli_PT> so you can accidentally taunt
[5:17:38] <InXplotch> only in post game
[5:17:42] <+Superbro64> can you do taunt without setting a taunt button, or is that a confrimed bug?
[5:17:45] <+Demoli_PT> yeah exactly
[5:18:06] <InXplotch> yes, I mash X on my controller and post game I get punch even though it's HS normally

[5:48:41] <%Revorger> @Shishi1205 you did a heck of a lot better than I did, so you should be proud
[5:48:55] <Aussie_Manny> Is the online playerbase of Strive still healthy right now? Is it easy to connect to players and play?
[5:49:13] <@Menitta> it's still quite healthy
[5:49:14] <%slipdog> PC is bustling
[5:49:28] <%Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Every counter hit Ch that did not end in a PB hurts me bc I know I can do better
[5:49:31] <%slipdog> east coast always has a full park, multiple at nights
[5:50:04] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, I'm east coast Australia, so I just wonder how healthy it would be for me over here.
[5:50:08] <%Shad0wTag> Console is good too
[5:50:14] <%Shishi1205> @slipdog Only tried ladder on Eu so no clue how it goes there
[5:50:19] <%slipdog> yeah i couldve probably read your name LUL
[5:50:24] <Aussie_Manny> :P
[5:51:07] <%Shishi1205> So chat who is the last dlc char? Slayer or Jam?
[5:51:16] <%Shishi1205> Or Asuka
[5:51:53] <%townzzzzz> wondering what the story update will be

[5:52:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> noice
[5:52:24] <marcomatame> I think PC is more populated than console, am i right?
[5:52:54] <%slipdog> usually for anime/arcsys games ps4/5 is more populated, but more input delay. i havent been following this much tho
[5:54:19] <xbb1024> alliWave
[5:54:23] <Aussie_Manny> Chat, do any of you know which is more reliable for player count; Steam Charts or SteamDB?
[5:54:52] <%Juriasu> do they even have different numbers?
[5:55:52] <Veserados> You could just check steam LUL
[5:56:18] <%LastHazzerd> that's such a satisfying slam
[5:57:14] <Aussie_Manny> All-time Peak numbers seem to be different, but every other number is the same. I probably shouldn't sweat it then. PrideShrug
[5:58:17] <%slipdog> next one will work
[5:58:47] <%slipdog> @Aussie_Manny theres always that 2 hour refund window. buy it on a peak time for you and sus it out
[5:59:21] <RyuuAoi> Made it back in time! Woolie Vs. Reggie again?
[5:59:44] <Aussie_Manny> @slipdog That's a pretty good idea. wifiThink
[6:00:07] <%Juriasu> steam charts and steamdb should both get their numbers directly from steam, but they might poll at different rates so theres where the variation comes from I'm guessing
[6:01:53] <Ardisan_> SeemsGood

[6:09:11] <%SirGO0SE> Baiken town is poppin off
[6:09:19] <atomicxdj> turn around and let the wind blow XD
[6:09:31] <Aussie_Manny> Baiken Town is not a place. It's a people. 2020Forward

[6:09:39] <RyuuAoi> Y'all tappin?
[6:09:58] <RyuuAoi> GOOD DAY. BIG STREAM
[6:10:29] <%SirGO0SE> @Menitta did you find the queue git?
[6:10:29] <Ardisan_> I like Reggies Millia
[6:11:12] <%Juriasu> Axl is annoying for Millia but you can approach slower and loking to block his shot on the eay over to him, once you are in you have to worry about his super but that's it
[6:11:39] <RyuuAoi> Reggie exposing the strats! GITFG
[6:11:44] <%SirGO0SE> her air game is evolving to look similar to her xrd air game, right?
[6:11:51] <zenith0111> Axls deadzone is right above his head
[6:12:14] <@Menitta> @SirGO0SE I did but I gotta figure out how to add it to Nightbot.
[6:12:21] <%Juriasu> Millia does always kind of feel like a coinflip though, if she get's hit that feels like the round is over
[6:12:24] <@Menitta> Seems real useful
[6:12:48] <zenith0111> @juriasu Blocking Millia feels like a slot machine
[6:13:02] <@Menitta> "REACT BOY, REACT"
[6:13:17] <%Juriasu> @zenith0111 that's good, play her disc gacha
[6:13:30] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> <3
