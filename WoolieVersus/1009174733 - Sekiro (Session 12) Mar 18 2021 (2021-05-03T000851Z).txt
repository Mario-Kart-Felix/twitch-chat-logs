[0:06:16] <DatAsuna> it's not great but tbh the other live disney movies were worse
[0:06:18] <@Menitta> You want a better movie than live action Mulan, watch Memories of the Sword.
[0:06:19] <Tracazoid> Yes, I like Evolution as well. It gets everything wrong and it's pretty fun at that.
[0:06:19] <linSP> you LOVE to hate things

[0:09:38] <+krispen_wa> Recommend using FIGHTING GAME TERMS
[0:09:43] <%hax_metatron> MOTHERFUCKING PHANTOM TROUPE WOOLIE. They're AWESOME, that's how I'd sell HxH to you
[0:09:45] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL LUL
[0:09:46] <@Menitta> Woolie. Have you played Trauma Team? You should play it.
[0:09:57] <@Solidus_113> "Thing is good, you should probably watch it". end statement

[0:10:06] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Lum > Haruhi
[0:10:18] <+krispen_wa> woolie, you should try fate. it has punchgirls and a guy who turns black through suffering!
[0:10:22] <DatAsuna> so he does it to everyone else? xD
[0:10:23] <leith_aziz> I mean HxH is one of the first Anime's I watched thanks to a content creator watching along
[0:10:27] <+penjaza> Akudama Drive
[0:10:29] <leith_aziz> I think its a nice start
[0:10:36] <meady32> opinions or recommendations are like butt holes everyone has one and most of them are full of poop ha
[0:10:42] <@Solidus_113> You should probably play Superliminal, I think you'll really enjoy it Kappa
[0:10:54] <+krispen_wa> Mother's Basementcast?

[0:11:19] <leith_aziz> I mean DB is the easiest recommandation, but I wanna recommend QUALITY stuff (unless its DBS Broly, in that case watch it)
[0:11:25] <%hax_metatron> I mean HxH has the ultimate "You Didn't Win" moment in all anime LUL That's Woolie-bait if there's ever one

[0:12:06] <leith_aziz> I mean Mother's Basement is the best at recommending Anime from what I've seen
[0:12:13] <primaryfire> these days there's so much stuff I'm guaranteed to like that I have lined up, taking recommendations is a question of what I should drop/move down the list
[0:12:20] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie vs BLEACH (japan) when Kappa
[0:12:33] <%Mrthefro> Have you heard of Attack on Titan Kappa
[0:12:35] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Sunhi Legend recommends for Woolie
[0:12:38] <meady32> I always have friends who ask me what to watch and I'm like try this this and this but I'm not them ha
[0:12:41] <+RyTYoung> YES
[0:12:44] <leith_aziz> @primaryfire Oh I think I can relate with that. I havent even STARTED with One Punch Man
[0:12:45] <plaguedoctor_syan> Speaking of did you saw anything about Nomad?
[0:12:50] <+krispen_wa> WATCH ELFEN LIED WOOLIE
[0:12:51] <%smyld> You gotta tease the woolie not fully show
[0:13:11] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Sunhi Legend has to make a gif of it for Woolie
[0:13:13] <leith_aziz> There's so much I wanna watch, but dont know when to start
[0:13:25] <leith_aziz> HxH, OPM....
[0:13:26] <@Menitta> Like when you wanna suggest Trauma Team, show the Chie in that game
[0:13:43] <Robot_Nixon_> I love my friends but they just recommend me COD and Asscreed atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:13:45] <leith_aziz> Execution is the key
[0:13:58] <leith_aziz> If its good, people will recommend it
[0:14:02] <leith_aziz> Thats how it works
[0:14:11] <+Jiggisnipe> there is not enough time for all this stuff
[0:14:13] <+krispen_wa> Woolie, have you heard of thid channel called PatStaresAt? it might be interesting to watch
[0:14:15] <meady32> woolie is a g
[0:14:21] <andre11dr> I am tempted to read the HxH but im kinda worried
[0:14:21] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I cant keep up
[0:14:34] <%hax_metatron> Honestly I don't know if Woolie has ever heard of this anime called Death Note ... it's so cool
[0:14:34] <+krispen_wa> dont read hxh
[0:14:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No Woolie, you must play, watch, and experience everything good in life forever
[0:14:37] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Why read specifically ?
[0:14:37] <+krispen_wa> watch it
[0:14:38] <+Zanzibar_Junker> You should watch Ashita No Joe, Woolie
[0:14:43] <+TopTieramisu> ashita no joe
[0:14:49] <+TopTieramisu> that's the good stuff
[0:14:51] <Dementedpenguin> I didn't touch Resident Evil 4 until 2016 because I got tired of people trying to get me to play it. *Good game.
[0:14:53] <%hax_metatron> YOU'VE NEVER SEEN DEATH NOTE?
[0:15:03] <+tigerstyle96> Ashita no joe
[0:15:09] <+krispen_wa> YOU HAVE PLAYED ARKHAM?!
[0:15:13] <samazam94> yOu NeEd To WaTcH rE:zErO
[0:15:14] <leith_aziz> I should start to watch a new Anime. I've only stuck with JoJo
[0:15:19] <andre11dr> The HxH manga continues the story with some cool sounding shit but i don't know
[0:15:19] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Woolie would like psycho pass
[0:15:26] <+mecha_11> Watch the first season and then abandon it like a prom baby
[0:15:28] <%akuda_bar> hey menitta
[0:15:28] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Like Ashita no Joe is a cultural icon for good reason
[0:15:28] <+paladinstarbuster> YOU DIIDNT WATCH PSYCHOPASS?
[0:15:29] <%akuda_bar> you would like nier
[0:15:30] <OldManDeckardCain> a shame they only made one season of psycho pass huh Kappa
[0:15:32] <primaryfire> I'm jealous at how good pat is at selling a unique/interesting premise sometimes. I thought about outer wilds for like 4 weeks just from the podcast pitch before I had to jump on it
[0:15:33] <deceitfulgemini> @leith_aziz check out jujutsu kaisen, current running anime
[0:15:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Uma Musume Season 2 chads, where we at?
[0:15:37] <+TopTieramisu> megalo box is an adaptation of ashita no joe that kind of butchered a big turning point in ashita no joe
[0:15:44] <%hax_metatron> Have you heard of this cool show called Nalt and it's sequel Nalt Sheepden?
[0:16:00] <@Menitta> @akuda_bar in my defense, I think Nier Automata gets amazing 20 hours in.
[0:16:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie watch >My Favorite Thing< it's really good!
[0:16:07] <meady32> I'm new to anime is there a particular easy starter for me to get into it
[0:16:08] <%akuda_bar> @Menitta you have no defense
[0:16:12] <@Menitta> nyeh
[0:16:16] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Garo is great
[0:16:20] <binaryanomaly16> Yo, Garo Versus Road tho
[0:16:24] <+paladinstarbuster> Vanishing line?
[0:16:27] <andre11dr> Garou uhhh....goes in
[0:16:31] <binaryanomaly16> Loved that show
[0:16:35] <+Zanzibar_Junker> It's still a bit of time though
[0:16:42] <+krispen_wa> isn't that the thing that collabed with ffxiv?
[0:16:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @meady32 Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is pretty universally great
[0:16:45] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:16:45] <%jonblnt> Garou is also something I'm interested in getting unto
[0:16:48] <leith_aziz> @deceitfulgemini What is it about ? Aside from JoJo (all parts of Anime), HxH and OPM (some footage at most) I havent really GOTTEN into Anime. But I also play Guilty Gear and love the lore
[0:16:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @meady32 A Silent Voice or anything from Kyoto Animation in general, and Makoto Shinkai movies
[0:16:52] <binaryanomaly16> Versus Road!
[0:16:54] <+tigerstyle96> Which Garou tho
[0:16:56] <%jonblnt> Tv-nihon
[0:16:59] <@Menitta> This Garo doesn't have any Wolves or Marks of said wolves in it
[0:17:07] <+MrAtheGreat> I just got here. Is it just me or has Minh become a Ronin
[0:17:09] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I hear good stuff about FAB
[0:17:13] <meady32> @canadiananimatorguy cheers I will have a look
[0:17:29] <leith_aziz> Demon Slayer seems really good from what I've heard
[0:17:32] <Jashter18> Versus Road is great and perfect for a beginner
[0:17:35] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Ultraman Z is fuckin A
[0:17:35] <+TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz mob psycho is a series made by the guy who made OPM, and it's even better imo
[0:17:50] <+krispen_wa> mob psycho is top tier kino
[0:17:53] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Oh I know about that. REALLY good animation
[0:17:53] <meady32> @therealgreatergamer thanks man will look it up now
[0:17:54] <+LeaIsChill> Live action Garo is sick af
[0:18:06] <+LeaIsChill> It's Dante vs. Vergil
[0:18:10] <leith_aziz> Good that you reminded me TopTier
[0:18:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:18:11] <%CptnCampy61> I keep getting recommendations for Jutsu Kaisen. Is it that good?
[0:18:18] <%Mrthefro> YES
[0:18:25] <binaryanomaly16> Jinga is a Garo Spinoff featuring Kamen Rider Decade's actor, bro
[0:18:30] <@Menitta> i need to watch thunderbolt.
[0:18:30] <+krispen_wa> it has a himbo protag
[0:18:37] <+TopTieramisu> jujutsu is a good fusion of a bunch of great shounen
[0:18:40] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Gunpla > Gundam
[0:18:43] <andre11dr> Apparently Demon Slayer is really good and the author got to finish the story when she wanted which i respect
[0:18:45] <kikoeru_san> Woolie Gundam IBO is very good
[0:18:53] <@Menitta> IBO is eh
[0:18:56] <leith_aziz> But serious people, if you wanna recommend me a NEW Anime, give me some context/background
[0:19:26] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Thats always great when the artist can do it at their own pace and not drag it out
[0:19:31] <Johannen> From the currently released anime i loved "Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu" director created a studio to made that and its top quality, albeit the premise is somewhat cliche with isekai
[0:19:31] <+krispen_wa> mob psycho is a nice comfy story about how a middle schooler deals with his emotions and also being a psychic
[0:19:38] <binaryanomaly16> IBO was alright, tbh
[0:19:42] <kikoeru_san> I came to same conclusion with a bunch of the Gundam community
[0:19:46] <@Menitta> I dont like the main character in IBO
[0:19:46] <+TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz have you seen cowboy bebop or samurai champloo? they're very well known but they're classic for a reason
[0:19:54] <binaryanomaly16> Season 2 is iffy
[0:20:08] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Black is still my favorite Rider
[0:20:14] <leith_aziz> I might give MOB Psycho a shot in the future if I start exploring Anime
[0:20:16] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I'm old
[0:20:21] <+krispen_wa> POSEUR
[0:20:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @meady32 You can also go to "MyAnimeList" and you can sort and view pretty much all anime by review score or popularity. Information and synopsis's as well are given for all of them too
[0:20:26] <binaryanomaly16> Build and Zero One are my favorite Kamen Riders
[0:20:37] <andre11dr> Ive actually never finished Gundam Wing ,because that's not the one we got ,we got X instead
[0:20:40] <+krispen_wa> MAL ratings are trash tho
[0:20:51] <Robot_Nixon_> chainsaw man is neat :)
[0:20:58] <samazam94> not all kamen rider are good. fact its almost a 50/50. take that from a KR fan
[0:21:00] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Wing is awful, but the toys are great
[0:21:04] <+TopTieramisu> chainsaw-man is great
[0:21:05] <kikoeru_san> that's crazy Gundam Wing is melodramatic fun times
[0:21:06] <specftd> Fuck nerds
[0:21:08] <@Menitta> That's unfortunate to be scared off of that
[0:21:09] <binaryanomaly16> @samazam94 Agreed
[0:21:10] <@Solidus_113> Gundam smelly
[0:21:11] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu I know of the former, and I'd likely watch the Dub cause of Steve Bloom. But honest, I never saw it in my childhood. It was made way too early for my time
[0:21:11] <+paladinstarbuster> woolie confirmed poser
[0:21:19] <+TopTieramisu> i hope mappa gives chainsaw-man the love they're giving jujutsu
[0:21:29] <andre11dr> But most of UC is good
[0:21:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> MAL ratings hot take: 8+ Great 7-8 Literally either garbage or okay. 0-6 Absolute garbage
[0:21:42] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Gundam fans hate that people like the toys/gunpla
[0:21:55] <enerkaizer> I still think it's funny that Heeros and relenas love relationship got copied 1:1 by twilight
[0:21:58] <cheerfulbloke> give me Dorohedoro s02 ya cowards
[0:21:58] <kikoeru_san> basically all of Gundam is good with a few exceptions
[0:21:59] <+TopTieramisu> anime fans are definitely more forgiving of a show's quality as a whole
[0:22:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:22:03] <leith_aziz> Hwat is Kamen Rider about ?
[0:22:09] <leith_aziz> What ?
[0:22:10] <%hax_metatron> MINH YOU ARE A PURE
[0:22:12] <kikoeru_san> also @zanzibar_junker that bullshit since I love bith
[0:22:15] <%livlinn> joofbLurk
[0:22:25] <enerkaizer> @leith_aziz Super hero. Yearly changing main characters with different storys
[0:22:29] <andre11dr> Gundam or Dragon Ball, which is the worst fanbase?
[0:22:29] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I love both too
[0:22:40] <kikoeru_san> Dragonball
[0:22:46] <+TopTieramisu> @andre11dr jojo
[0:22:49] <alcmo> gundam no contest
[0:22:55] <alcmo> dragonball fans are based af
[0:22:58] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu LUL
[0:23:02] <meady32> variety is the spice of life
[0:23:04] <binaryanomaly16> ZENRYOKU ZENKAAAAAAAAAAI
[0:23:04] <+Zanzibar_Junker> but a lot of people look down on a gundam series of it's toy centric
[0:23:06] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu As long as they enjoy (and dont forget to critisize, for you can still critisize something and enjoy it) what does it matter ?
[0:23:07] <andre11dr> Not wrong
[0:23:09] <@Solidus_113> South American DB community is great though
[0:23:16] <@Menitta> "You want me to drop Top Gear? No."
[0:23:30] <leith_aziz> Whats toxic about Gundam fans ?
[0:23:38] <+TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz i mean it's hard to trust ratings in anime ratings sites
[0:23:38] <DatAsuna> yeah my biggest fear of gundam for ages was how much there is
[0:23:38] <kikoeru_san> lots
[0:23:39] <leith_aziz> Seems like such an old fanbase
[0:23:40] <+LeaIsChill> Sure did.
[0:23:45] <binaryanomaly16> Build Divers Re:RISE does a fantastic job at advertising toys while telling a proper Gundam storyline with real stakes, imo. Love that series to death
[0:24:02] <kikoeru_san> @binaryanomaly16 Big agree
[0:24:07] <enerkaizer> @binaryanomaly16 I still hope we get a third season
[0:24:10] <@Solidus_113> !
[0:24:12] <+krispen_wa> SNAKE
[0:24:13] <theanora1> One of the nice things about the majority of Transformers fans is that we realize the series only exsists as a vehicle to sell toys, so if we gate keep newbies, the old fans get nothing
[0:24:15] <primaryfire> ‚ùó
[0:24:16] <%Lion_kun> Oh I didn't know
[0:24:16] <+Jiggisnipe> yay
[0:24:18] <@Menitta> fuck I THOUGHT THAT WAS ME
[0:24:19] <+TopTieramisu> SNAAAAAAAKE
[0:24:25] <meady32> was that metal gear solid ringtone
[0:24:26] <+penjaza> There is actually another fight in that same spot
[0:24:28] <skyentombment> Scam?
[0:24:29] <PanicSwytch> SNAAAAAAAKE
[0:24:31] <%X2Eliah> Welp, CIA handlers had to intervene
[0:24:31] <%Lion_kun> I meant the second monkey
[0:24:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Go back there again Woolie, there may be something new
[0:24:35] <Puhff> Puhff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Good afternoon my Naturally Intelligent Gifted Generous Admirable friend! Just watched the Square Enix showcase of Forspoken; modern day black lady gets sent to magic world to fight dragons and do air dashes. Think I saw her throw a punch or two even.
[0:24:37] <Deasmeister> Codec call
[0:24:38] <andre11dr> Wow we have the same ring tone, wtf
[0:24:46] <+LeaIsChill> Have you tried killing God Rock Lee yet?
[0:24:47] <binaryanomaly16> @binaryanomaly16 Me too, chief
[0:24:52] <Spoofy16> why did the colonel call him...
[0:24:53] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Watch JoJo, MOB, One Punch Man, HxH, Demon Slayer, Cowboy Bebop. The rest you'll have to jusge yourself
[0:24:54] <kikoeru_san> @leith_aziz but the Gundam fan base has a lot of morons and stuck up assholes and not a lot inbetween
[0:24:57] <andre11dr> Now i need to change it thanks Woolie
[0:25:00] <%Lion_kun> I forgot you did the second monkey.
[0:25:01] <Bonezthewonderful> I would highly recomenr GAROVR
[0:25:01] <meady32> I have to get that codec call ringtone haha
[0:25:04] <+krispen_wa> what hapened last week in Sekiro, chat?
[0:25:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus There is a miniboss that spawns that drops a cermonial dagger where you fight the headless ape
[0:25:08] <+penjaza> There's another Shishimen Warrior where the two monkeys were
[0:25:15] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I have the Policenauts opening as a ringtone
[0:25:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:25:24] <DatAsuna> mysterious
[0:25:32] <+mecha_11> I like demon slayer but it's moving so slow man
[0:25:39] <@Solidus_113> Woolie got the tanto
[0:25:40] <meady32> it's psycho mantis really
[0:25:54] <Johannen> @TheRealGreaterGamer Are you talking about Tanto that drops from Shishimen Warrior?
[0:25:59] <leith_aziz> The thing is I never watched legends, but you do you
[0:26:04] <+Infeirno23> @mecha_11 i've heard people say that demon slayer is too fast LUL
[0:26:25] <DatAsuna> snyder dc is basically just worse new 52
[0:26:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Johannen Yes
[0:26:26] <+paladinstarbuster> clonewars isnt disney
[0:26:29] <andre11dr> Speaking of toxic fanbases here comes Star Wars LUL
[0:26:33] <+paladinstarbuster> originally
[0:26:33] <+krispen_wa> did woolie fight the area boys yet
[0:26:35] <DatAsuna> and new52 wasn't even that good
[0:26:38] <+krispen_wa> area boss
[0:26:41] <leith_aziz> Marvel deffinetely does its own thing (and thats not necessarily bad)
[0:26:47] <enerkaizer> same thing with Transformers nowadays. we get toys which are basically based on the decepticon justice division from the comics, and they kinda sorta ppear in the show, but they aren't the characters
[0:26:50] <%Lion_kun> Demon's Slayer needed two more arcs. The ending was too rushed.
[0:26:52] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus They already did that, and its nowhere near the spot you talking about
[0:26:57] <Spoofy16> snyder cut was def an improvement over the original
[0:26:59] <leith_aziz> Yes, but that movie was SO ENTERTAINING. Its so funny
[0:27:01] <pi_in_the_sci> Marvel hasn't been bad with adaptation yet, they mostly do there own thing
[0:27:09] <Robot_Nixon_> hulk's been jobbing since the first movie FeelsBadMan
[0:27:09] <Puhff> Disney and Mark Ruffalo both said Hulk is basically just comic relief now
[0:27:18] <+Zanzibar_Junker> No Japanese Spidahman
[0:27:19] <DatAsuna> @paladinstarbuster clone wars killed the eu and shoved it into legends 2 years before disney
[0:27:19] <leith_aziz> Also the Civil War movie was different, but its still great
[0:27:20] <+mecha_11> @infeirno23 I just feel like the characters barely make any progress. Such a delayed payoff for the time invested.
[0:27:26] <meady32> I don't want to see Toby maguire after his dance moves in number 3
[0:27:29] <Puhff> and the Spiderverse comic was dumb, so i'm glad they did not
[0:27:35] <Deasmeister> With demon slater I just couldnt deal with zenitsu
[0:27:39] <+Jiggisnipe> movies try to be alternative continuities
[0:27:40] <+Infeirno23> @mecha_11 you on manga or anime?
[0:27:42] <Puhff> Especially the time travelling vampire part
[0:27:44] <%Lion_kun> But we saw Iron man get comboed.
[0:27:44] <enerkaizer> @zanzibar_junker He is in the comics. takeya and leopardon get called when they have to fight something gigantic
[0:27:50] <+mecha_11> @infeirno23 anime
[0:27:53] <@Menitta> Man enjoys first 4 episodes of Wandavision before realizing he was watching Fraiser.
[0:27:54] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:27:55] <leith_aziz> Into the Spider Verse seems so much better than the comic it was based on
[0:27:56] <Robot_Nixon_> @meady32 thats why I want to see him come back...
[0:27:59] <+Jiggisnipe> ok ok ok
[0:28:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Johannen Did they get the tanto and finger whistle then?
[0:28:00] <%akuda_bar> LUL oh no
[0:28:10] <BUDderzIllA> If they do, it'll be in memory of your doll
[0:28:12] <%Mrthefro> LUL jfc
[0:28:19] <@Solidus_113> Forspoken is the old Project Athia reveal @WoolieVersus
[0:28:24] <Johannen> @TheRealGreaterGamer Yeah, that was last stream, finger was a hwile ago
[0:28:26] <andre11dr> SURE
[0:28:26] <samazam94> that bit is not okay dude
[0:28:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Cool
[0:28:32] <PanicSwytch> Chat....
[0:28:43] <meady32> @tuna_can_0 each to their own I guess haha
[0:28:43] <%ZweihanderSteve> se-ki-roooooooooo
[0:28:43] <+Infeirno23> game shilling LUL
[0:28:44] <DatAsuna> FAQ activated
[0:28:50] <%OmegaWeltall> muted?
[0:28:51] <DatAsuna> limiters disengaged
[0:28:54] <+penjaza> Time for thrilling dialog action
[0:28:55] <Futurecity10> I don‚Äôt get it
[0:29:04] <%OmegaWeltall> oh ok thougth my volume as effed
[0:29:05] <Johannen> I have missed the begining, did Woolie did all the backend for the Second Memory?
[0:29:06] <+snugglepuggs> Next bit
[0:29:10] <+krispen_wa> SOUND
[0:29:20] <+Reverend_Roscoe> wait, what got spoiled?
[0:29:23] <%X2Eliah> OK IT'S NINJA SOULS TIME
[0:29:31] <%ZweihanderSteve> nin-nin
[0:29:44] <andre11dr> y'all ready for the thrilling story?
[0:30:01] <@Solidus_113> we've committed bite za dusto
[0:30:04] <+penjaza> It was all a dream
[0:30:04] <leith_aziz> Was anything about FF7R said in the SE presentation ? Im waiting for a PC port (on STEAM, not EGS)
[0:30:16] <%X2Eliah> och nooooo
[0:30:20] <Johannen> They are not obtuse at all
[0:30:27] <@Solidus_113> @leith_aziz no
[0:30:28] <+krispen_wa> FROMSOFT? OBTUSE? NOOOOOO
[0:30:28] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its really not obtuse
[0:30:33] <Johannen> They are secret, for a secret ending
[0:30:35] <%X2Eliah> Obtuse souls?
[0:30:41] <+LeaIsChill> Secret btw LUL
[0:30:41] <+penjaza> They're pretty obtuse. No chance of figuring this out without a guide
[0:30:56] <andre11dr> Souls being obtuse, how could this be?
[0:31:01] <%Lion_kun> Set healing to triane
[0:31:01] <superchunk121> How close are they to the end?
[0:31:04] <Johannen> @penjaza You underestimate people
[0:31:08] <DatAsuna> "reee don't call it a souls game"
[0:31:09] <%Lion_kun> Set healing tontri
[0:31:11] <Psyramics> very
[0:31:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Good luck with that heal button
[0:31:19] <primaryfire> @superchunk121 2 main bosses and 2 optional ones
[0:31:21] <%Lion_kun> Set healing to triangle.
[0:31:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Purification is obtuse because you have to eavesdrop but the other one is pretty fine comparatively, you're basically just listening to the divine child
[0:31:26] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113: awwww. Well thanks anyway
[0:31:54] <%X2Eliah> yeeeee blood and guts
[0:31:55] <superchunk121> @primaryfire Thanks
[0:32:07] <ScreamLord> Almost every From Soft game has one or both of their signature weapons. The Moonlight Sword is in every Soulsborne game ever, King's Field, and Armored Core. And the Cursed/Chaos Blade is in Ninja Blade, Sekiro, and Soulsborne.
[0:32:19] <primaryfire> the buddha zone
[0:32:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[0:32:20] <+robosqueeb> panic
[0:32:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You eavesdrop on Kuro first!!!
[0:32:26] <Johannen> That
[0:32:33] <+Zanzibar_Junker> ease drop on kuro
[0:32:40] <primaryfire> you have to eavesdrop on her and kuro until she moves to the top of the stairs in this room
[0:32:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hide around the facade
[0:32:51] <+penjaza> @Johannen On a first playthrough with no outside info. Only someone who repeatedly checks for new lines would potentially find one
[0:32:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> exsctly
[0:33:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> BIG THINK
[0:33:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> WOW SO HARD
[0:33:07] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus That conversation is not vital to that ending, its just a small lore titbit to spoil their past
[0:33:22] <andre11dr> Yeah this part was always a little obtuse even for me
[0:33:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Now go up and confront Emma
[0:33:36] <Johannen> @penjaza Well there is always ng+
[0:33:39] <primaryfire> she should be at the top of the stairs now
[0:33:47] <Ashenik1> so strong and stupid sexy
[0:33:51] <+Zanzibar_Junker> upstairs
[0:34:03] <+penjaza> @Johannen NG+ doesn't count if you're a streamer
[0:34:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nah, they should keep doing it more
[0:34:06] <+LeaIsChill> I mean complain while you have your platform LUL
[0:34:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You mean USE THE BEST ITEM IN THE GAME MULTIPLE TIMES?
[0:34:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol
[0:34:14] <%X2Eliah> Imagine how crazy Elden Ring will be with absolute bullshit like that
[0:34:28] <%Lion_kun> I can't wait to fight the tree lord on a rainy day in Elden Ring
[0:34:31] <Deasmeister> People don't like obtuse make it MORE OBTUSE
[0:34:38] <Johannen> @penjaza Then why would doing the secret ending matter for a streamer? Just play the game
[0:34:45] <%X2Eliah> @Lion_kun Topless, in the rain, atop a tower
[0:34:54] <%ZweihanderSteve> FromSoft bullshit, as written by George RR Martin LUL
[0:34:58] <enerkaizer> Nothing will ever be so nonsens for a good ending as Bravely Default 2. You have to do something very silly to get the true ending
[0:35:09] <+krispen_wa> to get the secret ending, you must meet Guy Fieri, Lord of Flavortown
[0:35:11] <andre11dr> @lion_kun Didn't we do that already in DS3? LUL
[0:35:20] <%X2Eliah> I bet there will be some horse-related obtuse unlockable stuff
[0:35:35] <+mecha_11> It's like they put stuff like this in games and be like, "I'm so surprised no one has found my super secret Easter egg hohoho..." Jack offs
[0:35:36] <Lion_kun> You can give rice to Kuro and he makes even better rice.
[0:35:37] <+Zanzibar_Junker> yup
[0:35:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus That's fair.
[0:35:39] <Johannen> Rice is super easy, Emma dialogue is more secret then that
[0:35:39] <Ashenik1> @X2Eliah follow the maing quest instead of finding secret village inside a swamp: bad ending/missed half of the bossed..
[0:35:43] <+penjaza> @Johannen Woolie literally reverted progress to get the endings on the first go
[0:36:09] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Both of these people sound asleep
[0:36:19] <+krispen_wa> I just had Greirat die in DS3 because i accidentally entered irithyll dungeon. souls game plotlines are duuuuumb
[0:36:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Tired of this shit
[0:36:24] <Johannen> @penjaza That what he wants to do i guess, not everybody has mind goblins about doing everything on the first go
[0:36:57] <Sonny_Firestorm> Wait, he beat Glock Saint already?
[0:37:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Cinematic Camera!!!
[0:37:02] <linSP> but isn‚Äôt it cool that everyone has different experiences in their souls runs?
[0:37:09] <+krispen_wa> it's not
[0:37:18] <%X2Eliah> do you though?
[0:37:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I agree!
[0:37:26] <primaryfire> agreeable
[0:37:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> Please care about your Umu.
[0:37:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Save goodest boy!
[0:37:29] <Indigo_Automaton> Yes, agree
[0:37:33] <Johannen> Just do em
[0:37:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Fight with Hoshido
[0:37:39] <%Seancicle> quid?
[0:37:41] <+krispen_wa> MIKO SAMA
[0:37:44] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Well i know he dies if you send him to Irithil without saving onion bro ,was that what happened?
[0:37:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Wolf wouldnt let Kuro die ;_;
[0:37:49] <Ashenik1> @Sonny_FIRESTORM no, we do secret bosses/endings rigt now. Went back to the safe before the dragon
[0:37:50] <Augus7717> agreeable grunt @woolieversus
[0:38:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Ashenik1 oh thank god, I NEED to see Woolie react to that.
[0:38:23] <%X2Eliah> ?
[0:38:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "Aye, yo get pranked Kuro. We wont let you kill yourself."
[0:38:28] <Indigo_Automaton> It's very calming
[0:38:35] <+krispen_wa> @andre11dr you have to talk to patches, someone you don't know has any connection to greirat unless you talk to him after you send greirat
[0:38:46] <%X2Eliah> Wait why are the lines repeating twice
[0:39:01] <%Lion_kun> Father Owl is by far the hardest boss in the game. The final 2 bosses took me 15 tries. Father Owl took me 5 hours.
[0:39:02] <@Solidus_113> die through the mortal blade
[0:39:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "There must be another way"
[0:39:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Exactlty
[0:39:18] <%X2Eliah> "But why NOT try the guillotine?"
[0:39:20] <leith_aziz> SO remove his immortality without killing him
[0:39:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Yes
[0:39:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Lion_kun Difficulty is relative since different people prefer different playstyles.
[0:39:26] <leith_aziz> got it
[0:39:28] <primaryfire> final drinks before the dragon
[0:39:33] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> all the drinks
[0:39:36] <+LeaIsChill> If the kid's gotta go, the kids gotta go
[0:39:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus After Divine you cant give drinks anymore
[0:39:57] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Give Gourd Seed, how lewd
[0:40:09] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Oh right, and then even if you do he dies in Lothric anyway,it's really not a that good of an ending no matter what
[0:40:21] <%X2Eliah> Legitimately afraid that drinks might fuck up the obstuse progression steps
[0:40:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Be warned it will let you give the same drink twice so if you cant remember who you've already heard you're SOL sadly
[0:40:32] <Robot_Nixon_> which ending is this again?
[0:40:34] <+krispen_wa> Emma's voice is like butter
[0:40:39] <+TopTieramisu> it burns so good...
[0:40:39] <%Lion_kun> 3
[0:40:46] <$Holycow8498> Is Emma voiced by the same VA Makoto has in Yakuza 0?
[0:40:50] <primaryfire> ü§®
[0:40:51] <Johannen> I cant tell if @TheRealGreaterGamer is trolling or what
[0:40:51] <+LeaIsChill> I'm a monkey :)
[0:40:54] <+klooswep> monke
[0:40:55] <%X2Eliah> ....
[0:40:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Holycow8498 No
[0:40:56] <Klefth> Monkeys, huh
[0:40:59] <+paladinstarbuster> monkey girl
[0:41:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Holycow8498 I don't...think so? Lemme check
[0:41:10] <Reckless_Rob> Is this first playthrough?
[0:41:22] <%X2Eliah> "Monkeys" is a really insulting way to call foreigners
[0:41:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Johannen No? It let me give the same drink when I played at release. I was pretty peeved tbg
[0:41:32] <+krispen_wa> Monkey ASMR
[0:41:40] <Reckless_Rob> I think calling someone a monkey is insulting regardless
[0:41:41] <+paladinstarbuster> she returned to monke
[0:41:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Holycow8498 No she aint.
[0:41:42] <+TopTieramisu> relax chat. it's not racist euphemism
[0:41:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's not Sawashiro folks.
[0:41:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Saru...
[0:41:57] <+Mitchellsocks> The third battlefield orphan adopted by an old dude
[0:41:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I fucking WISH it was Sawashiro
[0:41:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Best monkey in the game
[0:42:02] <Reckless_Rob> Feed her seed

[0:42:05] <andre11dr> Don't talk to me about Monkeys, I'll get DBFZ SSJ4 PTSD
[0:42:11] <%Lion_kun> Unless he's Luffy where it's his first name.
[0:42:15] <primaryfire> the sculptor has some decent stories to tell from his shinobi days
[0:42:15] <%X2Eliah> @TopTieramisu ya ofc. But her monologue is way more hilarious if you look at it that way
[0:42:21] <Reckless_Rob> Is this first playthrough, chat?
[0:42:31] <%X2Eliah> @Reckless_Rob its complicated
[0:42:33] <Klefth> It is
[0:42:35] <Klefth> Kinda
[0:42:35] <Ashenik1> Emma is cool
[0:42:37] <Robot_Nixon_> @Reckless_Rob yes but also no
[0:42:40] <Sonny_Firestorm> Wait, he hasn't pieced it together that the Tengu is actually ------?
[0:42:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Rest and talk
[0:42:44] <Reckless_Rob> @X2Eliah Nani? @Tuna_Can_0
[0:42:47] <+krispen_wa> emma is waifu
[0:42:53] <plaguedoctor_syan> i think it was another drink
[0:42:56] <Reckless_Rob> What you mean chat?
[0:43:02] <Klefth> Oh, those Fromsoftisms...
[0:43:03] <+TopTieramisu> for those that don't know, keep in mind this is a game where the protagonist is called wolf
[0:43:04] <Johannen> Monkey Booze for her and Dragonspring Sake for Sculptor are my favourite
[0:43:04] <andre11dr> Emma is meh
[0:43:11] <Reckless_Rob> @Klefth yeh LUL
[0:43:14] <Robot_Nixon_> @Reckless_Rob its his actual first time going through the game, but he's looking through a guide to get the secret endings
[0:43:16] <%X2Eliah> There are some reloads involved and some guide reading to get a desired outcome
[0:43:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Little did you know Wolf sat there for three days
[0:43:38] <Reckless_Rob> @Tuna_Can_0 But it is his first playthough then
[0:43:41] <+krispen_wa> surprised Tomoe wasn't DLC
[0:43:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> All of Ishins drinks are great
[0:43:53] <+krispen_wa> given she's so important
[0:44:02] <+TopTieramisu> oh, you mean like velka?
[0:44:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> All of Isshin is great.
[0:44:09] <Robot_Nixon_> @Reckless_Rob yea, but ne knows some spoilery stuff. dont spoil tho
[0:44:18] <andre11dr> Compared to all the other fire keeper type ladies, Emma is really low, i like Emerald Herald more
[0:44:18] <Reckless_Rob> Yeah ok
[0:44:23] <Johannen> Ishin is the greatest character
[0:44:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @krispen_wa She was the Artorias of this game
[0:44:27] <+LeaIsChill> Sekiro? Getting DLC? You're funny LUL
[0:44:29] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu To be fair, the same is said to Geralt, and thats not what you'd think
[0:44:30] <linSP> get ALL the mcguffins
[0:44:34] <Ashenik1> Each week passes after the final death of Sekiro casue the bosses have to heal themselves and they need replacing soldiers
[0:44:35] <Reckless_Rob> I mean shes not even close to a fire keeper lady
[0:44:35] <ScreamLord> Tomoe was a real figure in Japanese history BTW. She was a bad ass archer lady in the 1400 I believe
[0:44:44] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:44:46] <Indigo_Automaton> If you smoke the branch and get cancer you won't be immortal anymore
[0:44:48] <andre11dr> SEEK SEEK LESSED
[0:44:55] <+krispen_wa> tomoe was an oni gamer
[0:44:56] <Reckless_Rob> Kuro dono?
[0:45:04] <+paladinstarbuster> Well you wouldnt want it to be easy for somebody to un-immortal you woolz
[0:45:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I want a sekiro dlc with tomoe kicking my ass just like Lady Maria
[0:45:30] <%X2Eliah> I really feel that Ghost of Tsushima kind of stole the spotlight from this game as the "go to game" for big medieval japanese energy
[0:45:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Go find the stick in all of japan
[0:45:44] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu geralt has many names and titles, doesn't he? sekiro is just called a wolf
[0:45:45] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Owl is an asshole
[0:45:48] <+krispen_wa> and nioh stole the spotlight for weeb souls
[0:45:52] <Sonny_Firestorm> @TheRealGreaterGamer I haven't touched Nioh 2's DLCs but I think the 3rd DLC has Tomoe.
[0:45:54] <Ashenik1> @ScreamLord 12th century
[0:45:55] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah Why ? This game won GOTY. Both have a spot
[0:46:02] <Johannen> @X2Eliah Well, its not realy medieval japanese, more of a mythical japanese feel
[0:46:17] <jorniev> The legendary Mcguffin mcguffin
[0:46:17] <+krispen_wa> @sonny_firestorm its suzuka, not tomoe
[0:46:19] <Blank9> I like Sekiro more than Tsushima, but Nioh's king
[0:46:21] <andre11dr> There's a giant erupting Volcano too which you can see from ashina castle, that really seems like it was meant to be DLC
[0:46:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:23] <primaryfire> old grave idol
[0:46:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Sonny_FIRESTORM I find that hard to believe considering that's a different game lol
[0:46:42] <bear_breaker20> @leith_aziz didnt this games publisher sponser that game awards show?
[0:46:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @andre11dr wtf really where?
[0:46:50] <%X2Eliah> So er what is the DLC situation with Sekiro? Are there any? Will there be more?
[0:46:56] <+TopTieramisu> sekiro's lore is much more interesting nioh's fantastical retelling of japanese history at least
[0:47:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> @TheRealGreaterGamer You DO realize that Tomoe Gouzen is a real life mythological figure and not Sekiro-original, right?
[0:47:03] <+TopTieramisu> interesting than*
[0:47:05] <+penjaza> No DLC. Likely ever
[0:47:08] <Ashenik1> @Blank9 but doesnt Sekiro have smoother combat?
[0:47:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I LOVE this dialogue
[0:47:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> Heck, go look up Tomoe in Fate/Grand Order.
[0:47:18] <%X2Eliah> oki, thnkx
[0:47:24] <bufflb> man I hope Woolie will stream Nioh 2!
[0:47:25] <%Lion_kun> 4th ending is my favorite because you're putting your Lord in a little girl so you can hunt a draf
[0:47:30] <%Lion_kun> dragon
[0:47:30] <Robot_Nixon_> Oh hey we just saw you Emma
[0:47:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's been the same the whole time
[0:47:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Im sure she is or inspired but you know thats not what we meant
[0:47:48] <+paladinstarbuster> every souls game is like this
[0:48:10] <linSP> wait, it‚Äôs all convoluted?
[0:48:10] <+krispen_wa> so what souls game NPC has the best questline and why is it Lucatiel
[0:48:10] <Johannen> 3 games ago? You talking about Dark Souls DLC that requires you to reload an area for the Hidden Golem to appear?
[0:48:23] <JetpackMcQuack> Nah, this boss gating is nuts
[0:48:36] <Flare3500> Lul every time I replay Dark Souls 1 I google search how to get the DLC area
[0:48:36] <Blank9> @Ashenik1 It's more streamlined, but it feels more arcade-y with being aggressive and having good timing, while Nioh's got the big moveset/combo variety. Real smooth going from drastically different stances or weapons to another.
[0:48:46] <+penjaza> Now go talk to/eavesdrop on them at the Dilapidated Temple
[0:48:46] <andre11dr> They always where like this, infact DeS is the worst one with this stuff considering the tendency system
[0:48:50] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu: Most well known titles: "Geralt of Rivia", "The Butcher of Blaviken" and "White Wolf" (based on him being taught in the Wolf part of the witcher schools. Easy explanation is that he wears a wolf medallion)).
[0:48:50] <Klefth> Oh fuck yeah, getting into Dark Souls' DLC was messed up lol
[0:49:16] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> this stuff made more sense in demons and dark 1 where you had an online community sharing secrets and helping each other figure out this new type of game
[0:49:16] <deviljhojho_> monk-e
[0:49:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sekijo
[0:49:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sculptor
[0:49:31] <Wahrow> Go back to monke
[0:49:31] <Robot_Nixon_> monke
[0:49:33] <ScreamLord> Hmm...Monkey
[0:49:36] <Flare3500> Every time you played a Souls game Woolie someone was there to guide your hand DS 1 to 3 with Pat and Demon Souls with German
[0:49:41] <+krispen_wa> souls games are basically intended to play with an online guide at this point
[0:49:54] <Klefth> Artorias was worse
[0:49:56] <+TopTieramisu> @leith_aziz just pointing out that wolf is only part of his identity. sekiro is ALWAYS referred to as a wolf
[0:49:58] <@Solidus_113> this is the most obtuse
[0:50:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's ALWAYS been like this
[0:50:00] <%Lion_kun> Darklurker is worse.
[0:50:07] <sporeian94> GO BACK I WANT TO BE MONKE
[0:50:09] <Johannen> This is not that obtuse compared to before
[0:50:10] <Klefth> Oof, Darklurker...
[0:50:10] <@Solidus_113> Artorias was one step of fight the new enemy
[0:50:11] <linSP> yeah demon souls is the easiest to botch, at least here there‚Äôs a definitive no going back point
[0:50:18] <Indigo_Automaton> Probably a bit of both
[0:50:19] <Blank9> The eavesdropping is the only part that's ridiculous to me.
[0:50:25] <@Solidus_113> Darklurker and Aldia are bad
[0:50:27] <leith_aziz> I never jived with a Souls game. Exploration was never my strength
[0:50:27] <+LeaIsChill> Nah that's the Tenchu I think
[0:50:32] <andre11dr> DS3 was worse than this with the side quests
[0:50:46] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu: I see
[0:50:47] <%X2Eliah> It kinda makes sense, this game assumes that you expect obtuse shit
[0:50:47] <+krispen_wa> how is aldia bad? you literally meet him as you progress
[0:50:50] <Equirah> FromSoft has always been obtuse, even before the Souls series @WoolieVersus
[0:50:50] <Johannen> Yeah, other Souls games are way worse compared to this
[0:50:51] <+paladinstarbuster> its not that obtuse its always like this
[0:50:57] <eldragon_1> It's more like they want the community to figure it out over time
[0:51:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus To be fair at least this one has a cohesive STORY instead. Like we are just following through with Emma's dialogue
[0:51:06] <Indigo_Automaton> DS3 is pretty comparable, at least with some of the npc quests
[0:51:07] <+OneTrueAsshat> I think they went hard on the quests because its single player only
[0:51:12] <+LeaIsChill> Right?
[0:51:14] <%hax_metatron> They've been obtuse since King's Field. You could miss 3/4 of the quests in KF1
[0:51:15] <wibbwobbler> so hard to do these blind honestly
[0:51:16] <Klefth> @Solidus_113 Artorias was go fight this golem that you might have passed up in archives, then go to this corner of the basin, reset, use a summon sign that you migh have missed, reset, go back to that corner in the basin
[0:51:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> You need to take the internet into account these days. Secrets are impossible to keep.
[0:51:22] <Flare3500> It's always like this Woolie , the problem was your 2 year memory gap
[0:51:29] <%Lion_kun> Siegmeyer in DS1 was way worse.
[0:51:32] <linSP> I can‚Äôt wait for elden riiiing
[0:51:33] <+Zanzibar_Junker> rice is though
[0:51:33] <+LeaIsChill> I skip dialogue so it becomes more obtuse LUL
[0:51:35] <@Solidus_113> I just refinished SOTFS and missed the Aldia fight because I didn't kill Vendrick, but did all the DLCs
[0:51:36] <RoboticRexkek> it is an issue when you LP tho
[0:51:42] <andre11dr> Well at least DS3 didn't lock you out of the final boss for no reason
[0:51:43] <+paladinstarbuster> why not
[0:51:43] <+penjaza> Darklurker > Sekiro Endings > DS3 Claim Fire > Bloodborne true ending > DS1 DLC entrance > DS3 other endings
[0:51:47] <primaryfire> I eavesdropped but I didn't know to go to the old grave idol, that's the only bit I looked up for this path
[0:51:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean fuck you can miss like a third of the game here, including the best area and best boss
[0:51:53] <TheyCallMeVawn> Theres not that many locations tbf
[0:51:55] <%X2Eliah> Man you're gonna have to read all of GRRM's novels to unravel the obtuse stuff in Elden Ring
[0:51:56] <Ashenik1> @Blank9 yeah, it has less variety and none of the combos but I feel the focus at parrying and posture makes it smoother and more satisfying IMO
[0:52:05] <+TopTieramisu> the path to darklurker was truly awful
[0:52:17] <Ashenik1> @X2Eliah LUL
[0:52:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Elden Ring will actually be a sequel to A Song of Ice and Fire
[0:52:23] <+paladinstarbuster> thats the intended way to play
[0:52:29] <+krispen_wa> most people would read guides though anyways
[0:52:32] <%Seancicle> We think we can see you
[0:52:32] <%X2Eliah> @TheRealGreaterGamer It might be a legit possibility
[0:52:37] <Blank9> Sekiro really shines when you go aggressive, just because you get super predictable counters to parry and chip at their posture when they block.
[0:52:39] <+Zanzibar_Junker> F'ong Darklurker
[0:52:39] <andre11dr> @penjaza Don't forget about DeS all the fucking tendency shit that is super obscure
[0:52:41] <%X2Eliah> @TheRealGreaterGamer unlikely ofc
[0:52:42] <+LeaIsChill> @krispen_wa "Most" is a big assumption
[0:52:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> No offense Woolie, but you've played these FromSoft games with someone guiding you. Other people figure it out on their own.
[0:52:52] <leith_aziz> Bloodborne secret ending isnt TOO hard to get it seems (never reached the end of the game), but you need to grind AND you need a guide for it
[0:52:54] <Johannen> Its a secret ending that is not "required" so no major losses on your first playthrough
[0:52:54] <+krispen_wa> its the best assumption
[0:52:57] <TheRealGreaterGamer> GRRM gives rights to Miyazaki
[0:53:04] <+mecha_11> They could just be betting on the fact that some people would stumble upon it randomly exploring anyway.
[0:53:04] <@Solidus_113> behind the temple
[0:53:12] <Klefth> Good idea, Woolie
[0:53:17] <+penjaza> @andre11dr At least all of that wasn't necessary or missing out on major content
[0:53:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can talk to them first and Sekijo will hint to eavesdrop
[0:53:23] <+krispen_wa> if it isnt your FIRST souls game, you WILL use a guide
[0:53:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:53:34] <Sonny_Firestorm> You gotta be a ninja to get these things.
[0:53:36] <+TopTieramisu> miyazaki solves GRRM's writing blocks by introducing the concept of book DLC
[0:53:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> Which is kinda the point.
[0:53:40] <eldragon_1> The entrance to DkS1 dlc was pretty hidden
[0:53:44] <Ashenik1> @leith_aziz the Bloodborne actualy feels quite good with its secret ending expet the Upper Cathedrial unlock-fuck that
[0:53:47] <%Lion_kun> Finding the Shulva key in DS2 lol
[0:53:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ninja aren't Samurai.
[0:53:59] <Flare3500> All I know is the every dlc in a souls game I replay , I have to google search to remember
[0:54:05] <leith_aziz> @krispen_wa Well, Bloodborne was the only one I played and I got lost. Never tried a guide
[0:54:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> spear
[0:54:23] <andre11dr> I always Bloodborne one to not be soo bad, you just need to explore and finish one sidequest
[0:54:25] <leith_aziz> @Ashenik1: Whats that part about ?
[0:54:25] <Johannen> @Ashenik1 I missed that whole area for my second playthrough and only found it by accident on the third
[0:54:29] <+penjaza> Damn, gotta get that Fire Umbrella again
[0:54:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "Lapiz Lazuli" lol
[0:54:38] <+krispen_wa> @leith_aziz that was your first though. every game after, you are now tempted to use a guide
[0:54:46] <%X2Eliah> @TheRealGreaterGamer ?
[0:55:11] <Sonny_Firestorm> Mercury is endgame material, mainly. Drops from Ministry soldiers.
[0:55:15] <leith_aziz> @krispen_wa: If it gets a PC port, I'll give it a shot
[0:55:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> HINT HINT WINK WINK
[0:55:15] <Indigo_Automaton> Flame is good for fighting headless, and the flame umbrella is very useful
[0:55:17] <leith_aziz> Proper
[0:55:19] <primaryfire> there's the hint
[0:55:20] <+TopTieramisu> really? i always want to do my maiden run blind
[0:55:20] <Klefth> There's your clue
[0:55:21] <Johannen> Drafty eh?
[0:55:27] <+Zanzibar_Junker> .......
[0:55:27] <+mecha_11> Also, being the kind of person that feels that you HAVE to get some specific special ending above just kind of enjoying the ride organically I think is a very unique perspective.
[0:55:30] <Ashenik1> @leith_aziz jumping off the ledge in a specifica area when a fucking Amygdala shoots at you...
[0:55:39] <%X2Eliah> That is not a strong hint
[0:55:40] <Robot_Nixon_> sure is windy today KAPOW
[0:55:46] <NewVegasResident> He still never finished the game!?
[0:55:51] <Flare3500> They all talking shit about you kill them all
[0:55:58] <%X2Eliah> oh no
[0:56:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> BibleThump
[0:56:15] <%X2Eliah> THE GUILLOTINE MUST BE FED
[0:56:26] <Johannen> I was just happy to visit the Divine Child and giving her Persimon was all the reward i needed
[0:56:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> It takes overwhelming force to defy the Guillhotine.
[0:56:50] <Flare3500> Yow what's that shit you talking about
[0:56:50] <%X2Eliah> Press X to doubt
[0:56:54] <+JingKaisean> This is so goofy
[0:57:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> How DARE you try to keep me from dying!!!
[0:57:21] <andre11dr> BITCH, ILL DIE WHEN I WANT
[0:57:30] <+JingKaisean> "Ok, I think he's gone now... let's talk" *Sekiro clearly in view*
[0:57:31] <Flare3500> So what's the big deal it's just suicide , were in a souls game everyone comes back
[0:57:39] <%Lion_kun> Divine Child is wholesome. Make her pregnant with Kurom
[0:57:43] <Ashenik1> Man, fromsoft game in other areas than medieval europe and japan...
[0:57:44] <%Lion_kun> Kuro*
[0:57:47] <+JingKaisean> "wasn't me"
[0:58:04] <+krispen_wa> Anata~
[0:58:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Lion_kun FBI: HMMMMMM
[0:58:06] <%X2Eliah> @Ashenik1 Like, Mars a billion years ago when it had life?
[0:58:06] <+JingKaisean> "saw ya'll talk bout me dying" "wasn't me"
[0:58:09] <Johannen> @Ashenik1 How about modern day America?
[0:58:15] <%Lion_kun> Thats the 4th ending.
[0:58:28] <Blank9> I wish they made an hd remaster of Shadow Tower Abyss.
[0:58:49] <Flare3500> Sekiro : Journey to West is all but confirmed , hopefully after Elden Ring if it ever comes out
[0:58:51] <srv4254> lets go
[0:59:05] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its time
[0:59:09] <+JingKaisean> "I... I... don't want to lose you baka"
[0:59:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Emma looting corpses lol
[0:59:15] <+krispen_wa> here we go
[0:59:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Not just an item, a memory
[0:59:24] <%X2Eliah> wait this game has buddha?
[0:59:28] <%X2Eliah> ... ok
[0:59:41] <Ashenik1> @X2Eliah Anceint Rome, Ottoman Empire, Achaemenid Empire, Mongolian empire, Ming China. There is so many :<
[0:59:46] <Pt_Kamen> Elden Rings isn't real, it's a fabrication, made up by our writers, never happened
[0:59:47] <primaryfire> I must carve the buddha.
[1:00:08] <+JingKaisean> Go... and change time
[1:00:13] <+krispen_wa> Is that where Nobunaga died?
[1:00:15] <+LeaIsChill> It's almost like something matters Kappa
[1:00:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No Minh why
[1:00:18] <Ashenik1> ...
[1:00:19] <Klefth> What?

[1:00:25] <+penjaza> You don't need to
[1:00:26] <leith_aziz> Elden Ring will happen when it happens. It's better to get busy with something else till its revealed
[1:00:26] <+krispen_wa> Is that the mountain Nobunaga burned?
[1:00:30] <andre11dr> Man but really, fuck is all this shit Fromsoft? When are you bringing THE PRESIDENT back and you spare us all this Elden Ring shit Kappa
[1:00:30] <+PkSilent01> U always start here

[1:00:58] <+paladinstarbuster> this guy is sick
[1:00:59] <+mecha_11> Oh my...
[1:01:00] <%X2Eliah> CAUGHT SLEEPING
[1:01:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> DOGGO TIME
[1:01:09] <Blank9> bust those borks
[1:01:10] <+LeaIsChill> Why is he a Lasagna?
[1:01:13] <leith_aziz> As someone who've seen so little of Sekiro, this looks sick
[1:01:14] <linSP> woofers
[1:01:15] <jorniev> how come he can time travel in this game?
[1:01:15] <andre11dr> Oh yeah it is that Last Blade 2 stage
[1:01:16] <%jepupu> Shadow Lasagna
[1:01:16] <Johannen> HoundMaster
[1:01:18] <Afroperonista> "Lone" shadow has a hundred wolves LUL
[1:01:25] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:01:27] <primaryfire> capra demon time
[1:01:28] <PanicSwytch> This battle is sooo good and annoying
[1:01:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> parry dogs
[1:01:30] <+Monkeydude07> Spear bearer has a sword
[1:01:30] <+penjaza> I recommend shurikens
[1:01:31] <JetpackMcQuack> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[1:01:32] <+LokimenD> solid first round Kappa
[1:01:35] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> this area gives no fucks
[1:01:36] <+Jiggisnipe> bork unbusted
[1:01:39] <+JingKaisean> ninja with doggos, you done fucked up now
[1:01:41] <+paladinstarbuster> Dog
[1:01:43] <Johannen> Whistle i guess
[1:01:44] <Flare3500> I heard them fireworks be poppin
[1:01:46] <%ZweihanderSteve> woffers go *bites your face-off"
[1:01:47] <%X2Eliah> So, right, imagine a game with dog enemies, but their growls and barks have actual really deep bass. Literal "woofers"
[1:01:51] <linSP> why do kicks in from games do way more damage than swords
[1:01:54] <jorniev> table hoping the wolves looks like fun
[1:02:16] <+JingKaisean> i never realized that a bunch of these ninjas only have 1 arm
[1:02:18] <+mecha_11> So many puppies
[1:02:18] <NumbF4ke> Did he summon wolves endlessly? I don't remember
[1:02:22] <jorniev> wait that dude has only one arm?
[1:02:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Yes he will lol
[1:02:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> LUL
[1:02:33] <leith_aziz> uhhhh
[1:02:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Unless you interupt him
[1:02:36] <%ZweihanderSteve> damn fire hot
[1:02:43] <Blank9> oops subs
[1:02:45] <xdeathknightx> toasty~
[1:02:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Oh my god minh
[1:02:53] <Ashenik1> ??
[1:02:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol
[1:02:59] <+klooswep> Or that someone told him you were dead
[1:02:59] <%DegenCat> "boss too easy" "tweak hitboxes?" "nah just give him respawning dogs lol"
[1:03:00] <Johannen> Is Mihn for real?
[1:03:11] <@Solidus_113> it's fiiiiiine
[1:03:11] <+penjaza> Nah, it's that the Owl was supposed to have killed you
[1:03:17] <PanicSwytch> No it hints the fight with lady butterfly
[1:03:20] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> this is the afterparty
[1:03:23] <@Solidus_113> It's been so long since the start of this game
[1:03:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He said "You're supposed to be dead" implying this is after Owl stabbed Sekiro in the back
[1:03:28] <plaguedoctor_syan> No is because someone kill you in the Lady Butterfly memory
[1:03:33] <+kknutson4> He can be pulled back and leashed to get a backstab
[1:03:37] <Klefth> How polite of Woolie to wait until he summons the wolves
[1:03:43] <Ashenik1> Did Woolie forget about Mikiri? ;d
[1:03:47] <%hax_metatron> You have to stay on bitches in this game, no backing off
[1:03:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> completely unrelated. Gul Dukat did nothing wrong
[1:03:54] <Canadian_Suit> @woo
[1:03:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> parry dogs
[1:04:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gul Dukat was cool
[1:04:03] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus you must dodge spam
[1:04:05] <+krispen_wa> this boss seems specifically designed to counter Woolie's passivity
[1:04:06] <Johannen> How many times Woolie has fought this guys already?
[1:04:06] <+LeaIsChill> Mikiri the kicks LUL
[1:04:09] <JetpackMcQuack> Give fromsoft the naruto license
[1:04:19] <Flare3500> Doggo cross attack
[1:04:21] <+JingKaisean> you can mikiri counter the kick
[1:04:22] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus DODGE SPAM
[1:04:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> There is a run button instead of a jump
[1:04:31] <PanicSwytch> I dont remember well but i think u have to kill the dogs first
[1:04:36] <+kknutson4> Does dog whistle work?
[1:04:40] <primaryfire> the shuriken might be a good way to secure the deathblow
[1:04:42] <%X2Eliah> @JetpackMcQuack yooooooo. A fromsoft Naruto Souls game would be insane
[1:04:43] <+LeaIsChill> Capra got a nice makeover here at least
[1:04:44] <Deasmeister> hold shuriken to power up if you want
[1:04:48] <Johannen> I am thinking about the whistle also
[1:04:49] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus I MEAN PARRY SOAM FUCK ME
[1:05:00] <Flare3500> If you deflect perfectly doggos immediately get full posture damage
[1:05:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> These guys RINSED me first time in Hirata
[1:05:04] <+JingKaisean> you can't give him space otherwise he re-summons the dogs
[1:05:14] <+paladinstarbuster> ooohh
[1:05:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> So satisfying to Git Gud and take em out easily by the end of the game
[1:05:27] <+LokimenD> Wait does that guy only have one arm?
[1:05:31] <%X2Eliah> isn't this the end of the game basically?
[1:05:35] <Flare3500> That super duper power kick can be deflected , it just looks really scary
[1:05:37] <Indigo_Automaton> Try hitting him with a shuriken when he's doing that mid-air slam kick
[1:05:41] <+TheotherKristian> Why do they call him the spear man?
[1:05:42] <Johannen> @LokimenD He only needs one arm to beat Woolie
[1:05:45] <Ashenik1> @X2Eliah YEP
[1:05:50] <+LokimenD> That's sick
[1:05:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> You have to be aggressive
[1:05:56] <+krispen_wa> why do they call isshin a sword saint?
[1:06:17] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa we know what saint he is Kappa
[1:06:18] <%Ariamis2187> the whistle tool should make animals berserk if its upgraded i think
[1:06:23] <%X2Eliah> Can you spawn your own doggos? wolfos?
[1:06:33] <+krispen_wa> he bears the spears, doesnt mean he uses them
[1:06:34] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus CONSIDER USING MIST RAVEN prostetic
[1:06:38] <+LokimenD> @krispen_wa Sword Saint is a title you get when you're super good with a sword. Musashi was one.
[1:06:43] <Johannen> @krispen_wa Cause people can only say Holy **** when seeing his balls
[1:06:46] <+JingKaisean> if you have the ability unlocked, you can assassinate the dogs for more health and iframes
[1:06:52] <Klefth> I could never find a proper use for mist raven
[1:07:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Chat no amount of backseating will help Woolie, he's had the whole game to learn
[1:07:01] <TheyCallMeVawn> Parrying > Dodging
[1:07:04] <+LeaIsChill> Oh man, that dog being a free heal is super nice
[1:07:07] <samazam94> bad translation. their japanese name roughly translates to "spear-footed", referencing their kicks
[1:07:14] <Blank9> mist raven is real good for canceling out of things iirc
[1:07:25] <+JingKaisean> on that 2nd overhead, spamming L1 will usually let you block the next attack
[1:07:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:07:38] <Blank9> there was some strange use that was consistently helpful that wasn't exactly what the move description implies it'd be used on
[1:07:39] <+TheotherKristian> !schedule
[1:07:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[1:07:51] <Johannen> @samazam94 Thanks for info, any other mistakes you can tell us about?
[1:07:52] <+DazzlingFuhrer> Engaging wolf based combat
[1:08:10] <+krispen_wa> is this a Bane fight?
[1:08:17] <TheyCallMeVawn> Spamming parry is no bueno
[1:08:21] <samazam94> thats the only one i know of really
[1:08:28] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa ahhaha oof
[1:08:32] <Johannen> @KillMyPast It can work actually
[1:08:37] <BakerBrute> ruff
[1:08:39] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus use must raven
[1:08:41] <Flare3500> it was working when there was no doggos at the beginning at the fight
[1:08:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> bark bark
[1:08:44] <Blank9> the dogs are free deathblows if you parry them
[1:08:45] <Klefth> Yeah, don't spam parry. You lose a lot more posture
[1:08:46] <Ashenik1> bark
[1:08:54] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Is Woolie going for Purification and Return?
[1:08:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Assuming you have the Shurikan upgraded you can hold the button down to one shot them
[1:09:00] <%Ariamis2187> whistle tool could turn dogs against master
[1:09:04] <andre11dr> Get borked
[1:09:08] <+LeaIsChill> Woolie dropping his word of the day "Frenetic" LUL
[1:09:08] <Flare3500> Just jump on the roof and thow shurikens at the doggos
[1:09:12] <@Menitta> Im gonna reinstall this game. Give it another go
[1:09:12] <%X2Eliah> @Spudnacious_Dynasty he's going for something crazy convoluted so maybe
[1:09:12] <TheyCallMeVawn> Shurikens oneshot doggos at least
[1:09:16] <+JingKaisean> yeah man... you're gonna just have to get good, you've got the tech you need
[1:09:19] <Pt_Kamen> Galford doing unlimited Poppy works
[1:09:29] <+krispen_wa> Just use the Kusarigama Kappa
[1:09:30] <Johannen> BeastJutsu
[1:09:32] <0BM0Z> @chat has he fought demon of hatred yet
[1:09:41] <+JingKaisean> long spark staggers them
[1:09:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No
[1:09:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He hasnt shush
[1:09:53] <0BM0Z> thanks :)
[1:10:17] <Flare3500> Dont use that sugar
[1:10:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Just hold the shurikon button down and it should one shot dogs
[1:10:20] <+JingKaisean> i don't think whistle turns the dogs, only monkeys
[1:10:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @JingKaisean It does once its upgraded
[1:10:38] <Johannen> Shame Woolie's bad habits are super showing right here
[1:10:42] <%X2Eliah> Man those katanas are getting CHIPPED
[1:10:43] <+paladinstarbuster> you cant spam parry
[1:10:48] <%X2Eliah> so much blade on blade contaxt
[1:10:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Although they will still attack you as well as everything else
[1:10:54] <TheyCallMeVawn> Spamming parry just gets you killed faster
[1:10:57] <andre11dr> Didn't do shit LUL
[1:10:59] <Ashenik1> if you parry the attacks that add posture even with the full posture you still dont loose your defense right?
[1:11:01] <thebalticguy1> they attack each other
[1:11:16] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @dmtjinni
[1:11:17] <andre11dr> Oh wait, it actually worked
[1:11:18] <+LeaIsChill> Wait, why would he whistle then?
[1:11:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Good boy
[1:11:23] <Flare3500> Your guard will not break as long as you deflect even if your posture is filled to burst
[1:11:24] <primaryfire> now he's getting shot lmao
[1:11:25] <Johannen> @Ashenik1 If you perfect deflect it no
[1:11:25] <+JingKaisean> the sekiro wiki says standard finger whistle should do it?
[1:11:31] <+robosqueeb> based! doggos respond to whistles
[1:11:31] <+RyTYoung> yeyeye
[1:11:40] <+robosqueeb> i never tried that
[1:11:41] <%Zero_Jacks> i know nothing about this game but it looks anime af
[1:11:42] <andre11dr> I didn't knew it did that
[1:11:45] <andre11dr> cool
[1:11:47] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dont spam Woolie
[1:11:47] <+krispen_wa> what was that
[1:11:54] <+TheotherKristian> He kicked you back to the entrance! Get the FUCK OUTTA HERE
[1:11:55] <+JingKaisean> oh yeah there's a guy shooting fire arrows in the back
[1:11:57] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL

[1:12:13] <andre11dr> Everyone gets Covid
[1:12:15] <+robosqueeb> are there any samurai champloo games? also how about that cowboy bebop live remake finishing up
[1:12:44] <%X2Eliah> So uh just curious... is this game reasonable to play with mouse+kb or do you basically have to use a controlled
[1:12:45] <Klefth> You're too far away
[1:12:46] <TheyCallMeVawn> Not close enough
[1:12:46] <%X2Eliah> ?
[1:12:53] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Locking on limits the effect of the whistle
[1:13:02] <dmtjinni> Im so happy to see Minh
[1:13:07] <+robosqueeb> @X2Eliah I could not begin imagining playing this with kbm
[1:13:11] <Ashenik1> @X2Eliah I mean you can but it was designe for controlers
[1:13:15] <+paladinstarbuster> whistle duet
[1:13:21] <%X2Eliah> mkay. thanks folks
[1:13:39] <+robosqueeb> doggo no!
[1:13:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> How nice of these guys to have a whistle competition
[1:13:46] <+krispen_wa> DOGGED
[1:13:47] <Augus7717> woolie will never reach the truth
[1:13:50] <%X2Eliah> Just whistle noise
[1:13:53] <+mecha_11> Yeah it wasn't working
[1:13:55] <Flare3500> Whistle showdown
[1:13:59] <%Ariamis2187> might need to break lockon with whistle first
[1:14:00] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dont lock on to him
[1:14:06] <Deasmeister> You have to be unlocked
[1:14:08] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> don't lock on to any of them
[1:14:10] <+penjaza> You don't have to target but you can't be too far away
[1:14:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah, the lock on
[1:14:17] <+JingKaisean> you're using the one that whistles one target
[1:14:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Locking on will limit the effect of the whistle to only that target
[1:14:19] <%illtima> Those one handed bastards are honestly the most annoying enemy in the game, after Headless
[1:14:28] <ghoulspan> B E R S E R K
[1:14:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:34] <+JingKaisean> you should probably use the regular whistle
[1:14:35] <+krispen_wa> Souls games are ALWAYS Berserk
[1:14:38] <+JingKaisean> the regular whistle affects all of them
[1:14:38] <andre11dr> @x2eliah Yeah never played this with keyboard, but i did play DS2 once with keyboard and it was atrocious
[1:14:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I think Ming might actually be right for once?
[1:14:43] <TheyCallMeVawn> Woolie refuses to learn timing huh
[1:14:44] <Ashenik1> doggos what the fuck?
[1:14:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> *Minh
[1:15:01] <Flare3500> There we go a decent match as long as doggos just watch
[1:15:05] <+LeaIsChill> This game on Mouse + KB may as well be OSU
[1:15:11] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr ya that's what I was afraid of. Have held off from any souls games myself so far because the reports are.... grim
[1:15:16] <Johannen> @KillMyPast Timing? He is still on the basics of unlearning jumping/dodging in favor of deflect
[1:15:17] <ExpressNode> Just bought a NVMe drive for my pc and now I gotta transfer my steam games. 1. BY. 1
[1:15:23] <+paladinstarbuster> yyeyeyey
[1:15:25] <+krispen_wa> YEYEYE
[1:15:46] <+robosqueeb> grappling away and healing might be best here
[1:15:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Use rice!
[1:15:50] <+Qexec> the jumping...
[1:15:54] <Ashenik1> :<
[1:15:55] <Klefth> Stop jumping
[1:16:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Rice rice rice! :D
[1:16:00] <TheyCallMeVawn> Stop jumping
[1:16:01] <Flare3500> we won one that's a lot
[1:16:02] <+krispen_wa> Stab up, stupid
[1:16:06] <+paladinstarbuster> stay on the grond
[1:16:07] <Equirah> why jump over rope
[1:16:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Were doing well until you backed off
[1:16:07] <Ashenik1> oh it is
[1:16:13] <Johannen> Guys can we make sure Woolie knows about locking on and whistle?
[1:16:17] <+JingKaisean> the healing is at the wrong time
[1:16:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Idol
[1:16:19] <%X2Eliah> JUMP FLATWAYS
[1:16:19] <+Zanzibar_Junker> you can run past him
[1:16:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> lock on and whistle
[1:16:27] <srv4254> x is dodge for nioh i think thats why hes jumping
[1:16:30] <+klooswep> What do you mean, clearly this is the final boss Kappa
[1:16:33] <Flare3500> Farmers worked hard for that rice
[1:16:43] <andre11dr> You can do it
[1:16:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You grossly overestimate how long it takes but yeah, you decide if you want to make the trips
[1:16:53] <andre11dr> You just gotta believe
[1:16:55] <+krispen_wa> pro tip for beating sekiro: play nioh, its better
[1:16:58] <+JingKaisean> ehhh the rice isn't gonna help you that much
[1:17:06] <+mecha_11> He gets so frustrated. Just relax man.
[1:17:07] <%X2Eliah> Oh they are not talking about "rice" as in mad tuned japanese street cars? ok
[1:17:08] <Ashenik1> LUL
[1:17:12] <+LeaIsChill> Jumped right into him LUL
[1:17:12] <TheyCallMeVawn> What is the plan
[1:17:18] <Pt_Kamen> Don't use the Elixir! You might need it in the fight after the next fight after the next fight after...
[1:17:22] <+TheotherKristian> Woolie will figure it out, the Woolie way
[1:17:24] <andre11dr> Ok believe harder tho
[1:17:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> Did he beat Butterfly?
[1:17:44] <%X2Eliah> yeeee
[1:17:51] <+JingKaisean> go in on himwhile the dogs distract
[1:17:59] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Locking on limits the effect of the whistle to only that target
[1:18:15] <+krispen_wa> i gotta stop watching boss fight videos. it gives me bad impressions of how people normally play this game.
[1:18:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ^^^^^
[1:18:19] <+JingKaisean> switch to regular finger whistle
[1:18:20] <Deasmeister> Can you anti air him swear I saw a marker for a second?
[1:18:28] <+JingKaisean> mountain echo has the lock-on mechanic
[1:18:48] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa that's kind of the same for most souls games tho. Watch a long-time player breeze through the game, vs. watch a blind first lp and its very different
[1:18:53] <Johannen> @JingKaisean No, Mountain Echo has the delayed whistle mechanic
[1:19:05] <TheyCallMeVawn> The jumping again
[1:19:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Someone take away Woolies jump button lol
[1:19:21] <0BM0Z> Deasmeister you can shuriken him while he's in the air
[1:19:26] <Ashenik1> Was Pat actually very good at playign Sekiro?
[1:19:30] <+DeaconBluesClues> what combat art he got and why should it be mortal draw
[1:19:31] <0BM0Z> but its not worth it tbh
[1:19:35] <+JingKaisean> oh shit i didn't even know
[1:19:38] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Just switch buttons in the menu
[1:19:40] <%X2Eliah> REMAP THE BUTTONS
[1:19:41] <+Zanzibar_Junker> nioh
[1:19:43] <+krispen_wa> TOO MUCH NIOH
[1:19:44] <TheyCallMeVawn> Just parry you coward
[1:19:47] <%Seancicle> those empty jumps are a dizzy
[1:19:48] <+LeaIsChill> Remapping ain't it
[1:19:53] <+JingKaisean> yeah jumping no good
[1:19:56] <+TheotherKristian> @TheRealGreaterGamer Woolie will figure it out, whether we like the solution or not
[1:19:56] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus what weapon art u got
[1:20:02] <andre11dr> @x2eliah Yeah once you know where to go Souls games trurn from 30 hours to 5 hours
[1:20:31] <+LeaIsChill> This game didn't have DLC but they do have a Boss Rush
[1:20:43] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Locking on limits the effectiveness of the whistle
[1:20:54] <%Seancicle> ‚¨áÔ∏è‚ÜôÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏èüÖ±Ô∏è
[1:20:56] <+krispen_wa> USE LIVING WEAPON, WOOLIE
[1:21:00] <%X2Eliah> yeah this whistling thing is not great, the dogs are super slow at attacking not-woolie
[1:21:01] <Ashenik1> whistle my whistle motherfucker
[1:21:08] <Flare3500> Your fighting flo rida just blow his whistle
[1:21:09] <%illtima> Aren't shurikens super effective against dogs?
[1:21:13] <@Solidus_113> doot
[1:21:19] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It'd work better if he stopped locking on before whistling
[1:21:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @illtima Yes
[1:21:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:21:46] <andre11dr> USE A STRENGTH BUILT, DEX SUCKS
[1:22:00] <+DeaconBluesClues> I dont see how this is better than shuriken to just clear the dogs immediately
[1:22:03] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro would be a cakewalk with poise
[1:22:08] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr uh can he respec now?
[1:22:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The shurikon should one shot if you hold the button
[1:22:16] <+LokimenD> So is this fight hard or is Woolie just bad?
[1:22:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @LokimenD Both
[1:22:24] <+DeaconBluesClues> @krispen_wa ax exists
[1:22:25] <$QueequegTheater> You have to really stay on him if you don't have emblems
[1:22:25] <%X2Eliah> it looks hard tbh
[1:22:27] <+krispen_wa> @lokimend yes
[1:22:28] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> this is the secret hardcore level so it throws everything at you
[1:22:29] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I usually firework the dogs
[1:22:33] <$QueequegTheater> @LokimenD It's tough
[1:22:34] <andre11dr> Yeah he just spam hexes Kappa
[1:22:35] <+JingKaisean> @DeaconBluesClues it's cause he's locking on and using it when he should just not target anything
[1:22:37] <Flare3500> column A and B , just perfect parry the dogs and instant kill
[1:22:38] <SilverChariotAxel> @LokimenD yes
[1:22:45] <samuelfisk> This fight is hard
[1:22:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus spam mortal draw on his asshole
[1:22:48] <+LokimenD> I see
[1:22:55] <+kknutson4> Fireworks
[1:22:56] <Johannen> @LokimenD This enemy appears multiple times thruout the game and should be prety easy by this point, dogs are addition difficulty
[1:22:57] <Canadian_Suit> @woolieversus just try must raven
[1:22:58] <%Juriasu> shuriken is a great idea for interupting his whistle
[1:23:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> mortal draw is the shit and should be spammed at all times
[1:23:07] <+TheotherKristian> I hate to be a backseater but this is a Sekiro Twitch stream
[1:23:08] <TheyCallMeVawn> Just dont lock on
[1:23:09] <shinichizio> Capra Ninja?
[1:23:19] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> oh my god he skipped the important word
[1:23:19] <Raldavar> Daily reminder that fire crackers are the most op ability in the game
[1:23:28] <$QueequegTheater> @LokimenD You have to be extremely aggressive to stop the dogs but Woolie doesn't seem to know that you can interrupt him summoning the dogs
[1:23:29] <+robosqueeb> so you cant guarantee who the doggos will fight but they will maybe focus on their allies
[1:23:29] <%X2Eliah> ...
[1:23:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> read the last sentence
[1:23:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> this is giving me some bloodborne flashbacks
[1:23:55] <andre11dr> Just use your Jinchurichi and bullshit yourself a win Kappa
[1:23:56] <+krispen_wa> BERSERK
[1:23:58] <srv4254> mikiri is the most op ability firecrackers most op tool
[1:23:58] <TheyCallMeVawn> "in theory"
[1:23:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> HE GOT IT :D
[1:24:16] <Johannen> Firecrackers and Whistle is the way to go
[1:24:18] <$QueequegTheater> @srv4254 Mikiri isn't overpowered, it's a counter move
[1:24:21] <An_Armed_Bear> So can you not just keep interrupting his summon with shurikens/going in
[1:24:22] <+klooswep> Yes, all the dogs will pull out guts' sword
[1:24:24] <+mecha_11> Why not use the finger one
[1:24:26] <@Solidus_113> candy
[1:24:30] <+Zanzibar_Junker> sugar
[1:24:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Also the Shuriken should one shot dogs if you hold the button.
[1:24:37] <+DeaconBluesClues> @srv4254 mortal draw is pretty good too. also use should be eating his way through his candies and any spare confetti
[1:24:37] <$QueequegTheater> @An_Armed_Bear You can but it's Woolie
[1:24:40] <%X2Eliah> @An_Armed_Bear going in appears to be difficult
[1:24:47] <+krispen_wa> people being disappointed by how woolie plays, have you guys ever SEEN him play a Souls game? this is par for the course
[1:25:03] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus eat candy. also confetti is flat damage buff vs everything, not just ghosts
[1:25:09] <+mecha_11> I really don't think he's doing that bad though.
[1:25:10] <Flare3500> Actually clean fight tho
[1:25:19] <%Seancicle> look at this motherfucker's number of tabs
[1:25:21] <+mecha_11> It's a process
[1:25:25] <Johannen> @krispen_wa Yeah, but Woolie always went on and on about how he loves Royal Guard and defensive options only to never learn how to deflect in this
[1:25:31] <+FlubbedPig> Mikiri counter is OP in-so-far as thrusts can also be parried, but Mikiri is easier to do, does more posture, and puts you in a better position in most circumstances. It's like, why EVER parry a thrust instead of Mikiri?
[1:25:34] <$horse_oil> super clean first start woolie
[1:25:35] <andre11dr> Remember kids, if you keep failing just consume sugar,it'll make you stronger
[1:25:35] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Most people will die a bunch on this fight on the first run I think
[1:25:39] <%X2Eliah> Like tbh in many of Woolie's sekiro streams I see ppl saying smth like "just keep going in full aggro" and I'm thinking, don't the enemies have ways to punish you for blind nonstop attack-mashing?
[1:25:49] <Ashenik1> I want to see how chat reacts if Woolie kills the final boss at first try Kappa
[1:26:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He's GOT GUD
[1:26:03] <jacob2pop> I feel like fighting one of these guys is like switching to easy on Guitar Hero. The slowness of some moves messes you up
[1:26:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> that's a big if
[1:26:07] <+krispen_wa> @johannen yeah, but was he ever GOOD with royal guard? its like him liking fighting games. just because he likes it doesnt mean he's even close to good at it
[1:26:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Ashenik1 that's what the glock is for. Kappa
[1:26:14] <TheyCallMeVawn> The idea is to be aggressive to take down posture, but be ready to parry and counter their counter attacks @X2Eliah
[1:26:15] <+DeaconBluesClues> @johannen real not backdating question. I know woolie lost to pat recently in strive. but in general how do they do against each other in fighting games
[1:26:17] <SilverChariotAxel> @X2Eliah Yeah but just stop 1 attack before parry and re agro really
[1:26:42] <samuelfisk> X2Eliah, that‚Äôs true. But the worst thing you can do is give enemies time.
[1:26:44] <Flare3500> There we go be aggressive be be aggressive
[1:26:48] <0BM0Z> hes figured it out PogChamp

[1:28:02] <+DeaconBluesClues> "years ago"
[1:28:03] <$QueequegTheater> YEARS AGO LUL
[1:28:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Years ago??
[1:28:11] <+MacDatAss> years ago?
[1:28:11] <%Seancicle> do we hear Cash the Dog right now‚ùì
[1:28:16] <OldManDeckardCain> the olden days when sekiro was new Kappa
[1:28:17] <0BM0Z> sekiro came out 2 years ago
[1:28:21] <+krispen_wa> MINH PREDICTED SEKIRO!?
[1:28:22] <0BM0Z> so years ago is right
[1:28:24] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Sekiro released in the Before Times
[1:28:27] <huskarl_zap> Wasn't that supposed to be Owl?
[1:28:28] <Flare3500> That happens a lot geometry lock
[1:28:28] <+Mcmoblin> Yup
[1:28:29] <+DeaconBluesClues> right now we having a flashback to sekiro estate IRL
[1:28:29] <plaguedoctor_syan> Congratulations Woolie you beat him legit
[1:28:33] <primaryfire> lol
[1:28:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:28:33] <Johannen> I assume it was patched as many other cheese strats
[1:28:33] <$QueequegTheater> Oh he'll tether
[1:28:33] <andre11dr> Yeah this game is super pro offense, sometimes too much on that front, like there's some bosses that you can just spam R1 and you'll win
[1:28:37] <+Mcmoblin> The cheese range
[1:28:38] <+AngriestAngryArtist> woolie with the laser focus
[1:28:41] <An_Armed_Bear> Playing Sekiro is just that DBFZ playlist "I promise I will never stop going in"
[1:28:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I still dont believe Minh beat this game
[1:28:47] <Robot_Nixon_> 2 years ago was 10 years ago NotLikeThis
[1:28:48] <Sparda_blizzard> Like the grand cathedral guy in BB
[1:28:50] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Doran strats
[1:28:53] <RoboticRexkek> 10 000 years ago
[1:28:57] <Flare3500> How many time woolie jumped in that ? none and he won
[1:29:00] <drk_sd> why does woolie look so displeased is he focused?
[1:29:04] <samuelfisk> That‚Äôs what Pat did to the Bloody Crow Of Cainhurst.
[1:29:05] <Indigo_Automaton> The only miniboss I cheesed hard was the Snake Eye bastard in the poison swamp
[1:29:06] <%X2Eliah> 2 years was before the pandemic era
[1:29:08] <linSP> Minh will use any strategy that works
[1:29:10] <+krispen_wa> Minh beat this game YEARS AGO, he must have lost all his experience in those decades
[1:29:12] <Equirah> They patched almost all of the exploits, current day Sekiro isn't the same as launch Sekiro
[1:29:14] <+TheotherKristian> OH shit, it's almost time, you all know the one
[1:29:16] <$QueequegTheater> @TheRealGreaterGamer Dude he hit max level in FFXV before leaving the first area, Minh's insane
[1:29:17] <+DeaconBluesClues> does anyone else just abuse weapon arts over and over like that five hit guaranteed damage one or just me
[1:29:22] <jacob2pop> 2 years ago we were still hyped for Cyberpunk
[1:29:26] <+DeaconBluesClues> or mortal draw every 5 seconds
[1:29:28] <%X2Eliah> OH NO SUMO DUDES
[1:29:30] <shinichizio> That man is just holding a piece of wall
[1:29:35] <andre11dr> Man the good old times of 2019 LUL
[1:29:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That's the wall there brother!
[1:29:36] <Flare3500> Axe tool
[1:29:37] <Johannen> Taro Troop is da best
[1:29:39] <Indigo_Automaton> THE WALL
[1:29:40] <+krispen_wa> its those Undead Settlement giants
[1:29:40] <Ashenik1> Axe
[1:29:42] <%X2Eliah> Man Sumo dudes are grods
[1:29:44] <+JingKaisean> use axe to cut shield
[1:29:45] <%X2Eliah> gross*
[1:29:46] <Ashenik1> THE WALL
[1:29:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> dont even fight this asshole just peace out
[1:29:49] <Robot_Nixon_> door strats atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[1:29:51] <NDenizen> AND YOU CANT KNOCK IT DOWN
[1:29:53] <KingOfTheGeats> forgot how to deal with these guys?
[1:29:59] <squigginster> Unstoppable Force vs Immovable Object
[1:30:04] <An_Armed_Bear> spear is for shields right?
[1:30:06] <linSP> THE WALL
[1:30:10] <$QueequegTheater> Axe
[1:30:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> ax is for shields
[1:30:14] <An_Armed_Bear> axe right
[1:30:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fire axe super strong for shields
[1:30:31] <+DeaconBluesClues> spear is for...not sure. I thi k the big money fight second phase amd that's it
[1:30:42] <Flare3500> Throw money at them it's fun
[1:30:43] <An_Armed_Bear> spear is for ripping off armor and stuff
[1:30:47] <kotl7> spear is for worms
[1:30:54] <Johannen> Spear is for swag
[1:30:56] <+krispen_wa> spear is for spamming r1 in PvP
[1:30:59] <+DeaconBluesClues> wait. if he literally forgot ax is for shields....oh man. so much rust.
[1:30:59] <+JingKaisean> spear can strip armor and pull worm out of headless ape
[1:31:05] <andre11dr> Just throw money at them like Johnny
[1:31:08] <An_Armed_Bear> tbf it's been a minute
[1:31:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i literally never used spears in this so idk what it's good for
[1:31:13] <cholongkh> soup
[1:31:20] <Flare3500> Deflecting that home run swing feels good
[1:31:24] <Robot_Nixon_> HURRHH
[1:31:25] <Augus7717> and back to jumping
[1:31:25] <NDenizen> same, used almost every mechanic except spear shenanigans
[1:31:32] <drk_sd> are these real life kappas?
[1:31:36] <Sonny_Firestorm> Japan has been obssessed with Baseball even bakc in the Sengoku period Kappa
[1:31:39] <Equirah> @cobalt_phoenix_ all vermin enemies including ape
[1:31:47] <+JingKaisean> if you hold L1, you recover posture
[1:31:47] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie needs to stop trying to dodge hits, blocking them is literally just better
[1:31:52] <Ashenik1> does dodge have I frames?
[1:31:53] <Flare3500> full posture damage and knockdown
[1:31:55] <+krispen_wa> is that guy ancient Shinada?
[1:31:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ really? what's it do to em?
[1:32:07] <Johannen> @Sonny_FIRESTORM Have you not seen Samurai Champloo?
[1:32:08] <+penjaza> For your next boss fight I really recommend puppet ninjutsu
[1:32:09] <NDenizen> It would help if the game didn't imply dodges work
[1:32:19] <leith_aziz> @QueequegTheater Dodging keeps the rythm, that how tend to react
[1:32:25] <An_Armed_Bear> You can rip the front armor off those guys with the spear right
[1:32:30] <%DegenCat> FOE DUMMY THICCBOY DEFEATED
[1:32:33] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Johannen That anime has some serious chronology issues.
[1:32:33] <+zaworldo> there was no rythm there man
[1:32:33] <$QueequegTheater> But so does deflecting
[1:32:34] <+JingKaisean> oh this part is not fun
[1:32:43] <$QueequegTheater> And deflecting actually does something
[1:32:44] <leith_aziz> Unless you have something like Royal Guard
[1:32:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Welcome to the land of chads
[1:32:53] <andre11dr> Oh right i forgot about this part
[1:33:03] <andre11dr> This part sucks
[1:33:05] <$QueequegTheater> Oh yeah, the Go Fuck Yourself Rooftop
[1:33:05] <An_Armed_Bear> Welcome to Footloose
[1:33:07] <+krispen_wa> lol ONE behind him
[1:33:08] <Equirah> @cobalt_phoenix_ more damage and pulls out the vermin for a weak state or insta kill depending on the enemy
[1:33:10] <+DeaconBluesClues> basically sekiro looks like souls combat, but is really mostly a rhythm game unless you spam weapon arts and tools at people (which you should)
[1:33:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey remember this as a miniboss? NOW DO 2
[1:33:12] <+JingKaisean> puppet one of these guys
[1:33:16] <primaryfire> this is about where I started running
[1:33:22] <%X2Eliah> Oh they even run like narutos
[1:33:23] <+penjaza> I REALLY REALLY recommend skipping this and using the puppet ninjutsu in the boss fight
[1:33:28] <Johannen> Use your jutsu Naruto
[1:33:29] <+LeaIsChill> 3 LUL
[1:33:48] <NDenizen> Genichiro was the coolest guy
[1:33:48] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[1:33:57] <+krispen_wa> CAUGHT YOU SLEEPIN
[1:33:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> THIS AINT A CUTSCENE BITCH
[1:33:59] <jacob2pop> True Ninjutsu is knowing to get the fuck outta that neighborhood
[1:34:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> AGAIN
[1:34:07] <srv4254> of fuck i forgot about this
[1:34:09] <$QueequegTheater> And he's much tougher
[1:34:17] <realfiction> sniped
[1:34:19] <Flare3500> Stealth Kill and Hide then repeat
[1:34:19] <+LeaIsChill> Oh boy its repeat time for all of the rest LUL
[1:34:21] <+penjaza> Opposite, it's later than before
[1:34:23] <+DeaconBluesClues> guess I'll die
[1:34:27] <%X2Eliah> this past is more past than the past time we came to the past
[1:34:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pain.
[1:34:29] <$QueequegTheater> Time for Mr. Snip Snip
[1:34:33] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:34:34] <KingOfTheGeats> you can't get an NPC to help you there
[1:34:36] <NDenizen> Not where but.......WHEN?!
[1:34:40] <Johannen> Mihn is on point today with the Crazy Talk
[1:34:52] <skyentombment> Snip snip no jutsu
[1:34:52] <andre11dr> Yeah this is probably the hardest part in the game
[1:34:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> No, it's because this is a recreation of the past made of memories. Different memories, different "pasts"
[1:34:59] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Hey Minh can you cut this in editing?
[1:34:59] <+penjaza> Jump through the fire for shortcut
[1:34:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I mean there were already repeated minibosses besides there
[1:35:00] <Ashenik1> reusing game assets SMART
[1:35:00] <Klefth> That was an opening...
[1:35:02] <+PulleylubeTW> how can it be crazy talk if its fact
[1:35:03] <Futurecity10> Don‚Äôt forget you have nonjutsu
[1:35:07] <Sparda_blizzard> Dark intensifies
[1:35:10] <+DeaconBluesClues> i cannot get over how aggressively naked all the bandits here are
[1:35:11] <+krispen_wa> @sonny_firestorm that sounds like some Kingdom Hearts bullshit
[1:35:16] <Johannen> @PulleylubeTW Cause its not fact)
[1:35:19] <+DeaconBluesClues> not even like a tiny bit of armor really
[1:35:23] <Flare3500> Just do that again
[1:35:23] <@Solidus_113> you did
[1:35:25] <TigerClaws12> People are gonna ask for the Woolie cut, not the Woolie cut Kappa
[1:35:29] <NDenizen> Japanese summer is hot man
[1:35:29] <%X2Eliah> makes sense
[1:35:30] <Klefth> You can do that
[1:35:32] <kotl7> lmoa how is fighting jobbers real, like just run away from the crowd
[1:35:32] <TigerClaws12> *minh cut, fuck me
[1:35:37] <Flare3500> You're a ninja , not a samurai

[1:35:40] <Ashenik1> @DeaconBluesClues well its hot in there
[1:35:42] <@Solidus_113> the NPC is around those waters IIRC
[1:35:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus equip mortal draw it rocks
[1:35:44] <%X2Eliah> I mean taking out the adds sounds logical
[1:35:48] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You have the Puppeteer Ninjutsu now
[1:35:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> @krispen_wa Sorry for the poor wording. English is not my native language.
[1:35:52] <samazam94> dont bother explaining the lore chat. woolie actively hates the story, remember?
[1:35:53] <Deasmeister> Pupetteer helps too
[1:35:55] <Johannen> @PulleylubeTW Mihn is wrong on the timing of this
[1:36:11] <Ashenik1> PepeHands
[1:36:18] <+penjaza> Jump the fire and use Puppet on Purple man
[1:36:19] <primaryfire> there's a fog wall, yeah
[1:36:19] <+PulleylubeTW> @Johannen allegedly
[1:36:24] <Flare3500> get good these fights are good warm ups
[1:36:24] <+LeaIsChill> get used ro fighting the same bosses again woolie
[1:36:24] <Klefth> Oh, you'll get new stuff
[1:36:29] <NDenizen> you basically already fought the "new" version with the red guard guy
[1:36:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> A chance for Woolie, to git gud
[1:36:38] <+JingKaisean> puppet the first purple guy
[1:36:39] <+krispen_wa> @sonny_firestorm nah its fine, it just sounds like something Xehanort would say or something
[1:36:48] <NDenizen> It is ludicrous that this boss gets repeated THREE times though
[1:36:50] <Flare3500> use stealth sugar
[1:36:50] <%X2Eliah> Honestly taking them out with a sniper rifle would be good
[1:37:03] <$QueequegTheater> Sekiro but WOlf has an AR-15
[1:37:16] <Johannen> @TheRealGreaterGamer I dont think that's the goal, the goal is to see some cool shit and mark Sekiro as Done
[1:37:19] <$QueequegTheater> parry this you fucking casual
[1:37:26] <+krispen_wa> if Sekiro was so good, why is there no Sekiro 2.8 Final Mix?
[1:37:28] <+penjaza> You can kill this room without alerting the boss
[1:37:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> @krispen_wa that's the thing: most of KH nonsense happens because the odd wording choices. (like using "hurt" as a noum)
[1:37:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Gachin Sugar or gachin Spiritfall turns you invisible! It makes sneaking easier
[1:37:38] <samazam94> things like this is why this game doesnt deserve GotY 2019 even if its a really good game
[1:37:39] <Klefth> smoke is real nice
[1:37:41] <Flare3500> stealth sugar is super strong
[1:37:42] <+robosqueeb> puppeteer was a lifesavor for me
[1:37:47] <+robosqueeb> lifesaver* lmao
[1:37:49] <NDenizen> A stealth game where you just talk no jutsu every enemy and make them your friend, ignoring all their past crimes
[1:37:49] <andre11dr> @queequegtheater You say that but have you seen the final boss of this game, he got gun
[1:38:07] <Ashenik1> @NDenizen you mean New Vegas? Kappa
[1:38:19] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie's memory is tricking him
[1:38:21] <TheKillerStove> @NDenizen Undertale?
[1:38:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol
[1:38:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> hey chat can you shut up with spoilers?
[1:38:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Dead end
[1:38:57] <Ashenik1> @samazam94 I mean there are no perfect games ;d
[1:39:11] <Johannen> Crazy Talk
[1:39:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh crazy talk activate
[1:39:24] <+krispen_wa> except DoA Ultimate Beach. thats a perfect game
[1:39:28] <deceitfulgemini> woolie could also just sneak underneath
[1:39:30] <andre11dr> @ashenik1 RE4 begs to differ
[1:39:31] <Equirah> Crazy Talk no justo
[1:39:32] <kotl7> LOL ceramic shard
[1:39:45] <NDenizen> [sound of crazy talk activating]
[1:39:58] <Johannen> Ceramic shard is only usefull for backstab cheese isn it?
[1:39:59] <Ashenik1> @andre11dr Ashley :3
[1:40:03] <+krispen_wa> Is this a batman predator section?
[1:40:04] <Flare3500> lul everyone agrees after the castle RE4 also kinda goes bad with the island
[1:40:14] <Klefth> ??
[1:40:21] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Johannen Also for disrespecc memes.
[1:40:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Oh god we gonna do the whole area like this lol
[1:40:39] <+krispen_wa> Disco Elysium is a perfect game
[1:40:40] <skyentombment> @Equirah I'd give you shit for writing it as justo, but I always write it as justu, guess if you write in spanish often it's just a simple skip in logic to get to justo
[1:41:10] <+DeaconBluesClues> @flare3500 I almost feel if you switched the level order such that it went village island castle it would be perfect
[1:41:12] <samazam94> @flare3500 its worse than the castle, but I wouldnt exactly say its bad
[1:41:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Gachin Sugar exists FYI
[1:41:20] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa well some people dont like that your character is pre made
[1:41:26] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Hmm,i just can't deny it
[1:41:33] <NDenizen> ! what was that noise
[1:41:47] <Indigo_Automaton> TONY LAZUTO?
[1:41:51] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[1:41:51] <+PulleylubeTW> LuL
[1:41:58] <+krispen_wa> the whole story only works because you have a premade character though. like it straight up wouldnt work with a character creator
[1:42:03] <Flare3500> Kill him on the way out
[1:42:09] <+LokimenD> oh lord he coming

[1:42:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> That poor dude lmao
[1:42:16] <+krispen_wa> its like nameless one in Planescape
[1:42:25] <andre11dr> Disco premade caracter is the best part
[1:42:31] <+JingKaisean> yeah honestly, this game is basically just hesitation is defeat
[1:42:40] <Johannen> Character Creator is overrated
[1:42:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:42:41] <+JingKaisean> go in, block everything, hit back, get gud
[1:42:43] <huskarl_zap> Getting crunk is a power up.
[1:42:54] <@Solidus_113> calculated
[1:42:59] <andre11dr> I love how you can change him ik so many ways but his still an asshole LUL
[1:43:01] <%hax_metatron> I think Woolie forgot / doesn't know that he can block arrows, since I started re-watching the streams almost every arrow hits him
[1:43:03] <+JingKaisean> the less you think, the better it is
[1:43:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> wack this bitch with a big magic sword or maybe an ax
[1:43:30] <+JingKaisean> oil/fire works on this guy
[1:43:31] <ghoulspan> i checked my discord lol
[1:43:45] <huskarl_zap> Crunk: 1 Ninjitsu:0
[1:43:45] <Johannen> @hax_metatron Its more his bad habit of using dodge and jump as his defense instead of deflect
[1:43:46] <Timarkot> You can stealth takedown them one by one
[1:43:50] <Flare3500> Just rehide and back stab the white guy
[1:43:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> de aggro and get a free takedown
[1:43:55] <+DeaconBluesClues> I threw so much oil and fore at people in this that I thought I was playing bloodborne
[1:44:08] <ghoulspan> @Solidus_113 does woolie even read this chat, at any point
[1:44:18] <kotl7> #terrified
[1:44:20] <leith_aziz> I myself prefer premade characters because they're written with more personality, depth and emotion. Geralt from the Withcer series is my favorite example. You can make choices with him, but they all to work within Geralt's character
[1:44:28] <deviljhojho_> never back down
[1:44:30] <jacob2pop> Probably not while playing, unless it's a pretty chill moment
[1:44:30] <@Solidus_113> randomly. try not to repeat tips
[1:44:32] <%akuda_bar> @ghoulspan occasionally
[1:44:37] <+DeaconBluesClues> @ghoulspan probably not.
[1:44:37] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Deaggro
[1:44:40] <%akuda_bar> and yeah, spamming does not help you.
[1:44:52] <Flare3500> just hide in that corner
[1:44:55] <Klefth> Don't spam block
[1:44:55] <huskarl_zap> Witcher 1 best story
[1:45:10] <+JingKaisean> it's gonna be hard to deaggro this
[1:45:18] <+krispen_wa> sekiro seems to have some of the best bosses but some of the worst in-between boss sections
[1:45:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can use gachin sugar to make it easier
[1:45:48] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz It depends ,sometimes you get premade caracters that are still just empty shells for people to project themselves on instead of actually caracters
[1:45:52] <%WutangchickeN> WutangchickeN subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Yo update on that treadmill thing where I was watching the DS anime while on the treadmill. I got to the flamelurker episodes. Tell Reggie I'm watching the Yakuza LP now. JK thanks for humoring my bad joke. Y'all keep being awesome.
[1:46:05] <$QueequegTheater> Drag him out into the water
[1:46:12] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Like Joker in P5. Yeah I know
[1:46:22] <NDenizen> anime
[1:46:22] <$QueequegTheater> He's way faster than Juzou so treat them like O&S
[1:46:23] <+krispen_wa> !POISON
[1:46:28] <realfiction> yo
[1:46:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> F
[1:46:33] <%WutangchickeN> Daaaaaaamn
[1:46:33] <Johannen> My favourite empty shells for people to project themselves on is Bioshock 1
[1:46:33] <+OblivionSword1> poison poison poison
[1:46:34] <+krispen_wa> DED
[1:46:40] <+OneTrueAsshat> should have backed off
[1:46:41] <%justcallmebobplease> Respect the big drunk with a big sword
[1:46:41] <Flare3500> You can style this game if you're really brave
[1:46:42] <+spicyappiejuice> that part sucks so bad
[1:46:52] <+MacDatAss> you can try to separate them using mountain echo
[1:46:55] <+Zanzibar_Junker> you can run a hank the ninja
[1:46:58] <leith_aziz> @Johannen Yeah that one works in its favor
[1:47:01] <+Zanzibar_Junker> gank
[1:47:01] <huskarl_zap> Crunk = victory over ninjetsu
[1:47:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Gachin sugar and bloodsmoke jutsu help
[1:47:08] <PanicSwytch> Kill the scouts first then separate the ninja before fighting the drunkard
[1:47:08] <+krispen_wa> i feel like the jedi exile in kotor ii is a good mix of pre-made and pre-existing character
[1:47:13] <+penjaza> Stealth Pill + Puppet purple man
[1:47:19] <+krispen_wa> set backstory, but you can affect the motivation
[1:47:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ^^^
[1:47:34] <samazam94> flamethrower?
[1:47:39] <Johannen> Mass Effect series i feel also in the same vein
[1:47:43] <arussoltzm> Juzou is weak to oil and fire combo that‚Äôs what I used
[1:48:13] <leith_aziz> How Mass Effect handled it was ok, but that aspect got weaker with each game sadly
[1:48:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus gachin and puppeting the purple shinobi is probably the easiest way to do this
[1:48:31] <Gelphaze> That's how I got him, I puppet the purple guy.
[1:48:33] <+krispen_wa> ME3 straight up had Shepard talking without your input several times
[1:48:33] <jacob2pop> By the 3 Shepherd was Ken Doll with a murder biner... and a regular boner
[1:49:00] <leith_aziz> Shepard did get more involved dialouge in 3, but now the role playing aspect was gone
[1:49:01] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Gaichin Sugar and Puppet the Ninja
[1:49:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ^^^^
[1:49:10] <SenpaiMD> someone tell him blood mist lets you stealth kill the ninja
[1:49:29] <leith_aziz> SO it leaned more towards one side, but lost the input for choices
[1:49:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> These guys shouldnt aggro the Drunkard
[1:49:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:49:42] <+krispen_wa> FAILED
[1:49:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:49:42] <Johannen> Literal JUMP IN)
[1:49:43] <+mecha_11> LEEERRROOOOOYYY
[1:49:55] <+JingKaisean> hug wall, use ceramic
[1:49:59] <2deep5u> what happened so far?
[1:50:02] <+krispen_wa> USE ZWEIHANDER FOR POISE
[1:50:06] <Timarkot> He is panicking
[1:50:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Jesus christ lmao
[1:50:22] <Flare3500> Fireworks is a life saver than the umbrella
[1:50:27] <Johannen> @2deep5u Woolie unlocked the second memory and beaten a Ninja mini boss
[1:50:28] <kotl7> the butt is clenched and the heart is racing
[1:50:41] <2deep5u> @Johannen I see, thanks.
[1:50:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Now gachin and puppet the shinobi!
[1:50:56] <andre11dr> The worst thing in choice games, is your caracter saying/doing something you didn't choose, Taletale was the most prominent example
[1:50:56] <+krispen_wa> Now Gacha and Genshin the Impact!
[1:51:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ^^^^^^^
[1:51:03] <jacob2pop> Outside of the bridge section I never really found the Umbrella very useful, but that's just me
[1:51:09] <+JingKaisean> man, if he gets to isshin today, it's not gonna be a good time
[1:51:19] <+krispen_wa> Yakuza Isshin isnt even localized though
[1:51:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You should still crouch lmao
[1:51:32] <Flare3500> jobber arrow man saw you
[1:51:33] <andre11dr> And let's not even talk about Cage choices
[1:51:36] <+penjaza> That would have worked if you had stayed crouched
[1:51:49] <jacob2pop> I had a buddy you spent 6 hours trying to beat Isshin, made him do a complete 180 on the game as a whole
[1:51:56] <Johannen> S T E A L H D
[1:51:56] <jacob2pop> Bad time indeed
[1:52:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> SLICK AS FUCK
[1:52:13] <Flare3500> Thank you Rihanna for that save
[1:52:22] <+Grayhammatter> uh.
[1:52:24] <+mecha_11> The use of the umbrella was stylish tho
[1:52:27] <+krispen_wa> Is this Ornstein and Smough?
[1:52:35] <Johannen> O_o
[1:52:35] <+OblivionSword1> yes
[1:52:41] <+AdlerDynamic> which fights has woolie finished?
[1:52:50] <Robot_Nixon_> discount O & S atpCap
[1:52:51] <Johannen> It is literal Snorlax and Poison Chu
[1:52:51] <ghoulspan> BIG CHUNGUS
[1:52:52] <%WutangchickeN> Dang that dude's a BEAST
[1:52:56] <Gelphaze> No shame in retreating.
[1:53:01] <%WutangchickeN> wutang6BEES wutang6BEES wutang6BEES
[1:53:03] <Flare3500> Just crouch and sugar
[1:53:08] <samuelfisk> You need to run
[1:53:34] <kotl7> no hesitation in running away=no defeat
[1:53:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Just remember to CROUCH still when you use gachiin sugar
[1:53:53] <Ashenik1> Mongolian tactics
[1:53:56] <andre11dr> Wait, won't they regen?
[1:54:00] <Flare3500> TONY LAZUTO
[1:54:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> TONY LAZUTO?
[1:54:27] <Johannen> Guys you know Woolie is going Keto, he cant have Sugar)
[1:54:29] <NDenizen> The whole operation is
[1:54:30] <+krispen_wa> Anyway, the whole operation is run by-
[1:54:32] <Gelphaze> Get a kill, get another pip.
[1:54:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Okay, Sugar, Crouch, Puppet Shinobi
[1:54:59] <+krispen_wa> Genshin sugar
[1:55:05] <+krispen_wa> the worst kind of addiction
[1:55:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You got detected because you werent crouched
[1:55:24] <NDenizen> super rare chance of actual sugar
[1:55:30] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[1:55:37] <@Solidus_113> he was
[1:55:49] <+krispen_wa> woolieONEGUY
[1:55:50] <+mecha_11> Lol
[1:55:50] <+penjaza> He moved after being aggroed
[1:55:52] <Johannen> Crazy Talk
[1:55:54] <NDenizen> so was Magneto, Minh
[1:55:58] <+OneTrueAsshat> ruuun
[1:56:18] <Ashenik1> is minh the woolieONEGUY ?
[1:56:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> This is how I did it you just have to be fast as hell. It isnt easy but it works
[1:56:19] <Johannen> Well Woolie did O&S so he can manage
[1:56:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> RESET MORE
[1:56:39] <+RyTYoung> nope nope nope
[1:56:41] <+krispen_wa> But did Smough vomit fart gas?
[1:56:41] <+Reaverund> I think this is just Orenstein and Smough
[1:56:46] <EvolNom> Look at that intense look on Woolies face
[1:56:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:56:49] <Dakuu75> woolie sounds a little frustrated
[1:56:59] <+RyTYoung> the amount of bosses I haven't fought in this game NotLikeThis
[1:57:01] <@Solidus_113> because it is
[1:57:02] <andre11dr> Luckily Genshin didn't attract me because i don't care about generic anime art style, but still the combat and idea seems interesting
[1:57:06] <Ashenik1> but O&S was acutally a well desgined fight
[1:57:09] <jacob2pop> @Johannen "Mom I want O&S!' "We have O&S at home." *O&S at home*
[1:57:16] <Johannen> Hahahaha
[1:57:20] <Johannen> That one got me
[1:57:35] <+mecha_11> This fight does seem like they almost want you to cheese.
[1:57:37] <NDenizen> O&S but they brought the swamp level with them
[1:57:40] <Gelphaze> Can woolie get him, can he do it!
[1:57:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I mean getting ganked in Sekiro is way more manageable than other souls games lol
[1:57:52] <+krispen_wa> Genshin combat is better in theory than it feels in execution
[1:57:58] <leith_aziz> I dont mind Anime art style, but I want it to look more distinct. Something like Guilty Gear
[1:58:14] <Flare3500> I wonder when Elden Ring will come out
[1:58:16] <leith_aziz> There's nothing wrong with the style
[1:58:16] <metalwolfchaos> PokCharizard
[1:58:18] <+penjaza> Purple man moved after getting aggroed but it does actually work.
[1:58:30] <DudeDern> Yo what‚Äôs happening
[1:58:32] <Fibroidworm39> hi everyone VoHiYo
[1:58:35] <+ja07sj> mmmhmm
[1:58:37] <kotl7> mmhh yes use all those delicious emblems
[1:58:38] <leith_aziz> @Flare3500 Dont wait. Move on and then you'll see a reveal
[1:58:48] <+RyTYoung> My issue with Genshin was that I was getting bogged down by all of the side quests which kept taking me away from the main questline
[1:58:53] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz That's why i said generic anime
[1:58:58] <+OneTrueAsshat> when you used the sugar you approached too slowly
[1:59:09] <jojomzo> Try it and find out
[1:59:10] <%justcallmebobplease> Go test it then Woolie
[1:59:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus He may have detected you because you had already aggroed them before but you can also use the whistle to lure a 1v1
[1:59:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lure the ninja away with ceramic or whistle and then puppet his ass
[1:59:22] <andre11dr> Guilty Gear is definitely not a generic style
[1:59:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> @RyTYoung Here's a better theory: this is your first gacha and you're not used to the rythim these usually go for.
[1:59:30] <Johannen> Genshin Main problem is the limited way of getting the currency for the new characters and leveling up, its BOG
[1:59:39] <jojomzo> Just lab it woolie
[1:59:39] <+penjaza> @OneTrueAsshat I think it's that the guy moved further away and was more in the big guy's vision cone
[1:59:48] <+krispen_wa> @johannen so every gacha's problem
[1:59:49] <deceitfulgemini> what is puppet?
[1:59:51] <Ashenik1> I dont think we will finish Sekiro today ;(
[1:59:51] <DatAsuna> I was afk, why we talking genshin? lol
[2:00:01] <Flare3500> Let's try it again for the third time
[2:00:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You have to be really quick to get the puppet deathblow
[2:00:02] <Johannen> @krispen_wa Genshin is even worse
[2:00:13] <kotl7> also can't you just vault over a killable dude to backstab/puppet him easily? I remember this being in the game, maybe I'm wrong
[2:00:15] <+OneTrueAsshat> def doable its the only way I clear that section
[2:00:25] <+RyTYoung> @sonny_firestorm Calling Genshin purely a gacha game isn't the whole draw to that game though, but yes the gacha elements pushed me away also because of how big a time commitment it is
[2:00:26] <leith_aziz> Oh I know. The style of Strive is so good. You can tell with the characters that they've grown and have matured over time. I love when art can tell you so much about the characters
[2:00:29] <alaskanbullwurm> @kotl7 yes
[2:00:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It isnt easy as you can tell because he's staring at him but it does work
[2:00:40] <Fibroidworm39> oh wow, someone gifted me a sub, thank you so much woolieSHOOK
[2:00:41] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa you can't gacha for ascension materials, you gotta do the weeklies. so it's more of an mmo/live game thing
[2:01:08] <kotl7> @alaskanbullwurm thanks I wasn't sure
[2:01:18] <hassanico2> did the game always have those caution indicators if someone detects you?
[2:01:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can use the BloodSmoke jutsu on normal enemies to re enter stealth, switch to Puppet and execute it while the smoke is still present
[2:01:26] <leith_aziz> Faust's new look and animations are so good in managing to tell a story
[2:01:29] <+RyTYoung> @hassanico2 yeah I'm sure it did
[2:01:30] <DatAsuna> but yeah what brought up genshin anyways? lol
[2:01:31] <Johannen> Crazy TAlk
[2:01:33] <+krispen_wa> @datasuna i mean every gacha game locks ascension materials behind ingame grinds. its not new
[2:01:39] <Flare3500> Puppet Master !
[2:01:40] <Timarkot> Keep talking minh
[2:01:41] <leith_aziz> It tells you everything about him with little words
[2:01:44] <+Grayhammatter> crazy talk
[2:01:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "I'm wrong" LUL
[2:01:46] <redrins> im seeing a trend here
[2:01:47] <Flare3500> You have 2 friends
[2:01:48] <glass_marcus> Squad
[2:01:56] <+OneTrueAsshat> they wont last
[2:01:57] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa yeah but it's also not a gacha only thing
[2:01:58] <%jinking79> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:02:01] <samazam94> @datasuna because of gashin's sugar
[2:02:02] <+yukichocomilk> minh being wrong? unthinkable! Kappa
[2:02:03] <Flare3500> get the purple ninja as friends
[2:02:06] <Fibroidworm39> is woolie playing through sekiro for the first time?
[2:02:11] <+penjaza> I swear it works. I did it last week
[2:02:11] <DatAsuna> @samazam94 ah gotcha
[2:02:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Basically crouch and BEELINE for his back. Good luck and be mindful the other archer
[2:02:27] <NDenizen> Can you still reset puppet timer on a single puppet with repeated backstabs or did they patch that?
[2:02:34] <Flare3500> remember the arrow guy
[2:02:34] <+penjaza> Wait until it wears off or the puppets will aggro the boss
[2:02:39] <+krispen_wa> @datasuna more like "ah, gacha" amirite
[2:02:39] <Frostydough1> hey guys how far into the game is woolie percent wise?
[2:02:41] <+robosqueeb> i had to do that against spear dude
[2:02:45] <+MacDatAss> i think you can if you go fast enough
[2:02:54] <@Solidus_113> Try starting from the water instead of the far left
[2:02:56] <+prism253> you can if you jump behind iirc
[2:02:57] <andre11dr> Minh won Dokapon, of you dare to not trust him KNOW YOUR PLACE
[2:02:58] <DatAsuna> I've been enjoying genshin okay but I'm mostly just waiting for that new boss they showed in the story trailer
[2:02:58] <Flare3500> kill arrow guy first
[2:02:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You can use Ninjutso on deathblows from behind
[2:03:01] <+OblivionSword1> you can youu just have to do it from the back
[2:03:11] <DatAsuna> abyss herald be doing the dio wry's
[2:03:15] <+OneTrueAsshat> the puppets lol
[2:03:23] <+robosqueeb> your puppet boys aggrod him
[2:03:24] <primaryfire> there is a skill that lets you jump behind an opponent which essentially lets you puppeteer in active combat
[2:03:25] <+penjaza> The puppets aggroed the boss
[2:03:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You still have to be crouched lmao
[2:03:30] <+robosqueeb> totally would have worked
[2:03:33] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its not limited to stealth kill, its a backstab. You can bypass that by jumping after breaking posture if you have that skill
[2:03:39] <$TheFabledAble> you can silent sprint on them tho?!
[2:03:39] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie, you forgot to crouch
[2:03:45] <+OneTrueAsshat> your puppets aggroed them and come from the right side
[2:03:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It isnt easy so dont feel bad.
[2:03:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[2:03:49] <$TheFabledAble> oh yea he didnt crouch
[2:03:54] <+mecha_11> Aye aye aye
[2:04:12] <+krispen_wa> Woolie Versus the Universe
[2:04:13] <Frostydough1> puppet aggro, like hunters who dont turn off their pets in WoWO LUL
[2:04:15] <andre11dr> Poison poison poison
[2:04:16] <%livlinn> woolieMINHMAX_LH
[2:04:18] <GothicCrusader> woolie, just die, wait for deagro and deathglow ninja
[2:04:19] <Flare3500> Let's try it the 4th time
[2:04:36] <+penjaza> If you crouch and don't have puppets to aggro them
[2:04:36] <Fibroidworm39> walking crouch, hidden parry
[2:04:38] <$TheFabledAble> or maybe just crouch while you have the transparent consumable on?
[2:04:40] <PanicSwytch> Do it your way Woolie
[2:04:43] <GothicCrusader> revive for deadblow
[2:04:45] <+OneTrueAsshat> you have to b-line directly to his back dont come from the side and try to get aorund him
[2:04:46] <+krispen_wa> let's just admit sekiro sucks outside of bosses
[2:04:52] <Robot_Nixon_> its us, we are the problem atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:04:55] <plaguedoctor_syan> You could pupet other guards then let that guards agroo the ninja and durunkward and without geting into the fight
[2:04:56] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Try leading them to the normal enemies and using bloodsmoke in combat
[2:05:00] <andre11dr> Just use black magic and you'll win
[2:05:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It is possible but it is hard. So dont worry about it. Do it however you can
[2:05:23] <+taa672> fuck I remember this part, this sucked ass
[2:05:27] <Coystick> I don't think this was the intended experience
[2:05:28] <+mecha_11> It's all a process. Skinning a cat.
[2:05:29] <plaguedoctor_syan> then when they are distracted you can steath
[2:05:37] <Johannen> Guys bloodsmoke is easier
[2:05:47] <PanicSwytch> He woke becuz he noticed the puppets
[2:05:57] <samazam94> does he even have bloodsmoke?
[2:06:04] <+penjaza> This part does suck though
[2:06:15] <Raldavar> you have to channel your chakra with the right handsigns baka
[2:06:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol that could also be true, they may have noticed the puppets
[2:06:20] <andre11dr> Oh this part totally sucks
[2:06:27] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If Puppet is not working out for ya try just bloodsmoke and kill, pressing jump after breaking posture will allow for backstab Jutsu
[2:06:31] <Coystick> Love this track
[2:06:38] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I don't remember this part, is this the real owl route?
[2:06:43] <+krispen_wa> yes
[2:06:45] <andre11dr> Yes
[2:06:46] <PanicSwytch> yew
[2:06:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> @The_Forgotten_Alligator Ye
[2:06:50] <+OneTrueAsshat> approach the ninja from the right side not left
[2:06:55] <+OblivionSword1> @Johannen He doesn't have the flip
[2:07:09] <Johannen> @OblivionSword1 Gosh darn it
[2:07:09] <Gelphaze> I didn't stealth it I had to get them to chase me until they lost interest and then while they were walking back That's when I went for the kill.
[2:07:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Try number 4 Good luck!
[2:07:14] <+OneTrueAsshat> ninja is looking your direction
[2:07:15] <+penjaza> I don't blame you if this is the last try
[2:07:16] <PanicSwytch> 2 archers
[2:07:23] <+mecha_11> He keeps forgetting about the archers though
[2:07:26] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @FlubbedPig
[2:07:30] <Coystick> "Speed"
[2:07:36] <+penjaza> I never killed the archers when I did this
[2:07:37] <andre11dr> Ok taking bets ,will he get it?
[2:07:38] <%jinking79> yeah it's crouching to him
[2:07:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You cant stand!
[2:07:48] <@Solidus_113> don't stand at all
[2:07:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You cant stand
[2:07:51] <%justcallmebobplease> That will fail
[2:07:54] <%justcallmebobplease> You can't do it standing
[2:07:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No standing at all!
[2:07:55] <kotl7> @andre11dr lol no chance he does
[2:08:07] <+OneTrueAsshat> crouch and approach from the right side
[2:08:12] <+mecha_11> ARCHERS
[2:08:13] <+robosqueeb> just crouch while popping sugar
[2:08:14] <NDenizen> crouching is a direct modifier to stealth pretty much
[2:08:14] <Augus7717> @woolieversus crouch fast the entire way
[2:08:15] <PanicSwytch> Let him do it. He will learn
[2:08:22] <+MTLxSpider> just outfootsie them.
[2:08:33] <%justcallmebobplease> If done 'right', yes - it's fiddly, and frankly I feel it's more reliable to bait them far enough they lose interest, then get them on the walkback.
[2:08:35] <+OneTrueAsshat> you are not pointing his backside from your side
[2:08:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You just crouch walk as fast as possible towards his back from the right also be mindful of the archer lmao
[2:08:40] <@Solidus_113> crouching only has one modifier for stealth, it doesn't matter how slow your go
[2:08:46] <andre11dr> So I'll bet that he totally gets it
[2:08:48] <Flare3500> This won't work
[2:08:51] <andre11dr> GO WOOLIE GO
[2:08:51] <Johannen> Right side
[2:08:55] <Timarkot> LUL
[2:08:57] <andre11dr> DO IT
[2:08:57] <@Solidus_113> you were on his left
[2:08:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Right side
[2:08:59] <+AdlerDynamic> the other side
[2:09:00] <jojomzo> I can't
[2:09:00] <Josef_Stryker> LUl
[2:09:04] <andre11dr> FUCK
[2:09:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Wrong side of the guy woolie
[2:09:08] <+AdlerDynamic> you were touching his side, not his back
[2:09:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You were at his left
[2:09:10] <@Solidus_113> that wasn't his back
[2:09:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Not behind
[2:09:11] <+zaworldo> Wrong side of the guy
[2:09:12] <Deasmeister> That was his front
[2:09:14] <%jinking79> u gotta be behind him
[2:09:15] <primaryfire> wasnt behind him
[2:09:17] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> oh boi this part
[2:09:21] <+AdlerDynamic> not because you were crouched, you weren't behind him
[2:09:22] <redrins> that was not his back LUL
[2:09:22] <%justcallmebobplease> You were facing the wrong part of his body - side vs back
[2:09:23] <+krispen_wa> WOOLIE VERSUS DIRECTIONS
[2:09:26] <$TheFabledAble> you were looking at his shoulder it looked like
[2:09:26] <+OneTrueAsshat> walk up from the right side
[2:09:26] <@Solidus_113> you were on his left arm
[2:09:29] <kotl7> he's facing the fat guy, you're in front, come on now
[2:09:30] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah, shitty backstab lockon issues, basically.
[2:09:39] <Augus7717> you approached him from the side @woolieversus
[2:09:47] <%kewlmyc> I can't tell if Woolie is having fun or not
[2:09:49] <DudeDern> Woolie channeling his inner QA
[2:10:06] <kotl7> or, you know, just tell the purple dude while the fat dude takes a while to come, then kill the fat dude solo
[2:10:07] <PanicSwytch> Kill the scouts first then separate the poison ninja from the fat dude
[2:10:10] <+AdlerDynamic> he does not seem to be
[2:10:13] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah Woolie are you still having fun because you sound a bit dead inside trying to do this.
[2:10:15] <+krispen_wa> Woolie having the time of his life right now
[2:10:27] <kotl7> just press L1 and R1 a bunch
[2:10:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You should be fine?
[2:10:38] <%jinking79> it's pretty much kill all the Ads then kill or puppet the ninja then the boss
[2:10:47] <andre11dr> And he said this wasn't a spite play, hah LUL
[2:10:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:10:54] <+mecha_11> He just gets frustrated and in his head. He just needs to relax.
[2:10:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> Kill everything, one at a time.
[2:10:58] <Timarkot> Noooo
[2:11:02] <thebalticguy1> WOOLIE MAD
[2:11:11] <+penjaza> Getting frustrated is understandable

[2:11:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Well on the bright side you can see how to approach and get the stealthblow, just make sure you get behind him asap lol
[2:11:28] <+mecha_11> @penjaza exactly
[2:11:32] <samazam94> whyyyyyy
[2:11:37] <Johannen> Why are we even here? Is it just to suffer?

[2:12:14] <samazam94> hes doing this lp for the bosses. its not optional for him
[2:12:15] <DudeDern> General question: what part of the game is this?
[2:12:28] <Flare3500> were at the tutorial
[2:12:29] <fangovafang> gotta play this again at some point..i didnt like da ending i got
[2:12:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @DudeDern Final act
[2:12:30] <Johannen> @DudeDern Optional secret ending part
[2:12:31] <+krispen_wa> the optional true end portion
[2:12:33] <kotl7> @DudeDern last quarter
[2:12:38] <PanicSwytch> He's near the end of the game
[2:12:41] <%jinking79> second Owl fight
[2:12:44] <DudeDern> Cool cool, thanks
[2:12:44] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> The owl fight
[2:12:52] <+TheNewZealandStory> idk what's going on but i assume woolie is overthinking something simple and making himself miserable for no reason
[2:13:04] <+krispen_wa> as is tradition
[2:13:04] <Johannen> @TheNewZealandStory Al always
[2:13:04] <meermadon> if he's not having fun he'll stop playing, stop worrying about it guys lol
[2:13:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @TheNewZealandStory To be fair, this part is far from simple
[2:13:31] <+penjaza> I believe
[2:13:38] <kotl7> do a monke flip
[2:13:42] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Believe it
[2:13:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Try number 6? Good luck! :D
[2:13:46] <andre11dr> I like how someone was like ' dude you spoiling it" and now everyone just saying the name of the boss
[2:13:53] <%ZweihanderSteve> as a souls encounter it does seem come
[2:13:58] <+ZweihanderSteve> complex*
[2:14:03] <Flare3500> why doesn't Woolie ever once try going to the right side lol
[2:14:04] <+penjaza> You just need a bit of a hook to come in behind the guy
[2:14:10] <NDenizen> its really not
[2:14:20] <NDenizen> by that point in the game you have 20+ tools to deal with it
[2:14:22] <arussoltzm> Good luck
[2:14:24] <Johannen> Its not simple, but it should not be as complicated as Woolie making it to be, Rust
[2:14:27] <PanicSwytch> Kill archers first! Aggro the poison ninja and separate from the fat guy
[2:14:32] <+robosqueeb> this kills the woolie
[2:14:38] <@Solidus_113> pain
[2:14:38] <+MacDatAss> did you try mountain echo yet?
[2:14:39] <+MTLxSpider> how did he know
[2:14:45] <+zaworldo> The archers or the boss see you
[2:14:48] <Coystick> It's an automatic alert trigger, there's no way you're getting it
[2:14:49] <+penjaza> Damn. I'm not sure how that didn't work
[2:14:54] <+zaworldo> i think it's the boss
[2:15:10] <andre11dr> Man this game sucks LUL
[2:15:12] <+mecha_11> A puppet would help him deaggro no?
[2:15:16] <Augus7717> it's literally the archer he just killed
[2:15:24] <Flare3500> welp crucify the guy who said this worked last week
[2:15:26] <Augus7717> he always sees him
[2:15:29] <+RyTYoung> Christ I do remember this fight now, feels like a lifetime ago when I did it
[2:15:34] <jojomzo> nah just do it right tho
[2:15:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can do what you did before where you approach from the side so that NEITHER can see you then quickly hook behind the shinobi for the kill.
[2:15:43] <+TheNewZealandStory> i dont understand what woolie is trying to do
[2:15:50] <+TheNewZealandStory> why not simply kill all the enemies
[2:15:55] <andre11dr> This why you never do this route LUL
[2:16:02] <%livlinn> shiaBuns
[2:16:05] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I think I just went yolo on this part, used every item and fought everyone
[2:16:07] <NDenizen> why does Juzo, the largest of the bandits, not simply eat the other five?
[2:16:08] <Johannen> @TheNewZealandStory That wouldnt be the Woolie way
[2:16:16] <Frostydough1> imagine this doesn't even work and it was just one guy LUL LUL LUL
[2:16:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the others?
[2:16:18] <+RyTYoung> YE
[2:16:20] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Johannen but like, why
[2:16:24] <Flare3500> what's that song we used earlier at the wolf boss fight
[2:16:25] <fangovafang> nice
[2:16:25] <kotl7> @TheNewZealandStory the small enemies aren't the problem, he's just fucking terrified of fighting the boss 2 on 1
[2:16:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It does work sadly, it's just hard
[2:16:32] <Flare3500> BE AGGRESSIVE BE BE AGGRESSIVE
[2:16:35] <+Trimoon333> I started hating this game around the second half
[2:16:52] <Johannen> I hated the outskirts, loved everything else
[2:16:56] <andre11dr> Ok NOW Woolie is dead inside LUL
[2:16:59] <+raybob23> whistle the ninja to you
[2:17:01] <Sunstalker> Is this just O&S of this game? kinamaHmm
[2:17:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can do what you did before where you approach from the side so that NEITHER can see you then quickly hook behind the shinobi for the kill. Good luck. :D
[2:17:04] <NDenizen> ! Hollowed !
[2:17:12] <+AdlerDynamic> honestly I'd just take the fight straight, this trick seems like more trouble than it's worth
[2:17:19] <@Solidus_113> if this still fails I'd just use a cheat trainer
[2:17:22] <Jimbobbity> i remember this, this area was cheap af
[2:17:22] <+JingKaisean> haha no, O&S would be the 2 apes
[2:17:34] <andre11dr> LUL
[2:17:46] <Ultimatefool> Porcupine
[2:17:51] <+MTLxSpider> ouf
[2:17:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:17:55] <+robosqueeb> understandably tilted
[2:17:56] <Johannen> Nah..2 Apes is Gargoyles cause the second one is far easier
[2:17:59] <+RyTYoung> @jingkaisean so true
[2:18:02] <fangovafang> da one armers LuvOops
[2:18:06] <@Solidus_113> time to go full unga
[2:18:08] <%kewlmyc> Oh dear....
[2:18:09] <Afroperonista> the definition of insanity
[2:18:14] <%justcallmebobplease> Welp, Woolie's locked in - best of luck forcing it proper-like, it's a rough fight as you know.
[2:18:14] <+tigerfang86> d e t h
[2:18:18] <Flare3500> Will Woolie throw a controller I can feel it , I can taste it
[2:18:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> STEALTH PACIFIST GLOVES COME OFF
[2:18:25] <vVAstrAVv> no think just hit wall gooder
[2:18:25] <andre11dr> DEATH TO ALL
[2:18:27] <kotl7> there we go, that's how it's supposed to be done
[2:18:30] <%jinking79> yeah they see u standing no matter wat
[2:18:31] <+TheNewZealandStory> why not simply parry the attacks
[2:18:33] <jojomzo> salt levels have reach critical levels
[2:18:37] <CureMode_> SALT AND IRON
[2:18:37] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Yo once you learn to deflect that spinning kick move, it's the best move you can counter
[2:18:40] <kotl7> just run, it's easy, they all skipped leg day and you didn't
[2:18:44] <nutimik> Woolie always looks angry when he's playing this game lol
[2:18:45] <velgaduere> stealth... stealth was never an option. BOP
[2:18:46] <Coystick> It's the Shinobi Hunter all over again, you're going to have an awful time of it if you rub yourself raw trying to circumvent the intended experience.
[2:18:49] <%DegenCat> just gotta git PJSalt until ya git gud
[2:19:03] <%WutangchickeN> You got this Woolz. Worst comes to worst you can always bring mr. snip snip out of retirement.
[2:19:11] <NDenizen> Sekiro has lots of options to circumvent the "intended" experience
[2:19:25] <NDenizen> at least outside of bosses
[2:19:30] <Afroperonista> ignored LUL
[2:19:34] <Coystick> Deathblowing this boss isn't one of them
[2:19:41] <%kewlmyc> Poor Mihn

[2:19:51] <Coystick> stealth deathblowing*
[2:19:56] <Klefth> never mind
[2:20:01] <Johannen> @Klefth He never used it
[2:20:07] <Equirah> Wollie, forget that rock exisst
[2:20:09] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie said no more stealth, only kill
[2:20:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh please
[2:20:14] <+zaworldo> Gameplan is kill
[2:20:16] <+RyTYoung> no talk just fight

[2:20:32] <Coystick> Do your best Woolie, it's a hard fight, took me many attempts too
[2:20:35] <+kullumanati> Such a weird 180 watching this stream and the Yakuza stream. Laughing fun engagement vs banging your head into a brick wall weird an apathetic attitude. Awesome

[2:20:40] <+AdlerDynamic> so I'm an outsider to this channel, what's the Woolie Versus show thing? Is it just him and a guest who tells him what to do?
[2:20:43] <+TheNewZealandStory> running around like a coward instead of learning to fight the enemy doesnt seem to be working very well

[2:32:14] <Flare3500> This could not be more david and goliath
[2:32:14] <+penjaza> This fight is some good stuff
[2:32:16] <+OneTrueAsshat> good riddance starving wolf
[2:32:18] <fangovafang> Don't he got da stab counter?
[2:32:21] <primaryfire> younger owl is beefed up
[2:32:22] <seithri> he litterally uses everything you can and have learned, thats so cool
[2:32:23] <+AgentApe0> @RyTYoung Everything but Sekiro unfortunately
[2:32:24] <NDenizen> 1
[2:32:24] <+snugglepuggs> Owl is just broader shoulder katana wielding FFxiv Cid
[2:32:27] <%jinking79> younger Owl
[2:32:32] <+RyTYoung> @agentape0 noooo NotLikeThis
[2:32:37] <+zaworldo> DAMN
[2:32:43] <andre11dr> He IS YOU
[2:32:48] <andre11dr> Again
[2:32:49] <%Lion_kun> This mofo for real
[2:32:50] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> The final boss is gonna take atleast 5 hours
[2:32:52] <+AdlerDynamic> owl has all the same dirty tricks
[2:32:55] <+tigerfang86> this man putting firecrackers on his sword
[2:33:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game is kind of like if Dark Souls and Furi had a baby
[2:33:09] <+RyTYoung> @the_forgotten_alligator that's how long it took me Kappa
[2:33:14] <Equirah> get ready for fume knight 2.0 LUL
[2:33:15] <NDenizen> Owl Father is harder than final boss tbh
[2:33:26] <+AdlerDynamic> truth
[2:33:27] <+AgentApe0> I've never done this route. Only done the 'true ending'
[2:33:28] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @RyTYoung me too xD
[2:33:29] <+snugglepuggs> This fight took me forever and what convinced me to do the DoH tree glitch
[2:33:31] <%Lion_kun> Owl Father is way harder
[2:33:32] <Frostydough1> Okay but hear me out, nitroglycerin covered sword
[2:33:36] <seithri> oh my god that fake out
[2:33:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Love this boss
[2:33:54] <binaryanomaly16> @Frostydough1 Bakugou approves
[2:33:55] <Ashenik1> IDK Owl Father took me less than the final boss ;d
[2:33:58] <+AgentApe0> Is it worth playing the game again for this section?
[2:33:59] <+krispen_wa> how long ago in the past is this? why is he so much stronger here?
[2:34:00] <+tigerfang86> @Frostydough1 sword.... but fire RPGEpicSword
[2:34:01] <+RyTYoung> @the_forgotten_alligator I'm sure it took 2 sessions too, i had to leave it til the next day LUL
[2:34:04] <Coystick> It will never be safe
[2:34:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> The hyper agressive approach is the game lol
[2:34:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Thats the way to play
[2:34:19] <nutimik> I think I found Sword Saint harder than Father Owl
[2:34:20] <seithri> this is back when owl was in his prime
[2:34:24] <Flare3500> It's like 3 years ago game play wise
[2:34:24] <PanicSwytch> U can dash to his right side when he does a running slash
[2:34:29] <2deep5u> the air in that room is frostier than a refrigerator
[2:34:42] <Johannen> Be..Be Passive..lame it out. Does not have the same ring to it
[2:34:46] <nutimik> Woolie's just concentrating
[2:34:50] <Coystick> Why aren't there any Sekiro Boss Vs Boss vids? I wanna see Owl Vs SS
[2:34:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah sword saint shits on everything
[2:34:56] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Man using hellzone grenade
[2:35:00] <+krispen_wa> @coystick there are
[2:35:01] <CalusRaccoon> OH FUCK he feints
[2:35:06] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:35:09] <huskarl_zap> no explination om why owl is huge
[2:35:10] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa before he got depressed after killing his only son
[2:35:16] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @RyTYoung That was smart of you, I stayed playing till like 5 am trying to beat that mf
[2:35:18] <TigerClaws12> pillars StinkyCheese
[2:35:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Coystick theres actually a guy does a whole series of them
[2:35:22] <+krispen_wa> @coystick there's literally an owl vs ss video
[2:35:23] <nutimik> Owl is just a huge motherfuck
[2:35:24] <+RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[2:35:30] <+zaworldo> @huskarl_zap He drank his milk
[2:35:32] <+snugglepuggs> Hold up. I forget . I know there are health bosses and parry parry bosses (like Genshiro) in this game. Was Owl Father health boss or a parry only boss?
[2:35:33] <andre11dr> This man is on some Ludwig shit with the faints
[2:35:35] <+casualplayerdude> Time to become a deflecting god
[2:35:37] <Coystick> @krispen_wa u better not be playing me
[2:35:49] <Klefth> Time to not spam block
[2:36:02] <nutimik> Owl is a health first, then parry boss
[2:36:02] <seithri> dude combines his katana strike with firecrackers, he might as well be using a gunblade
[2:36:07] <nutimik> like most big bosses
[2:36:13] <Jackomaning> I yelled "you're not my real dad!" at this boss many times
[2:36:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He's like "How the fuck do you have that I just killed you a second ago."
[2:36:21] <huskarl_zap> Damn getting over intolerance of lactose sure is beneficial
[2:36:24] <Nocturnment> Yeh yeh, umbrella OP
[2:36:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yoooo that was badass
[2:36:24] <+RyTYoung> @the_forgotten_alligator I'm sure I gave up at around AM hours hahaha
[2:36:27] <+FrostedZaibatsu> The stare down
[2:36:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> bonkk
[2:36:42] <linSP> I love this fight because he uses all your cheap moves but in an overpowered way
[2:36:44] <+tigerfang86> oh no he's SUPER COOL
[2:36:45] <Johannen> Does he have more comments about prosthetics?
[2:36:46] <TigerClaws12> bopped
[2:36:48] <+RyTYoung> Did he just say eekum bokum?
[2:36:54] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> good try woolie!
[2:36:55] <jojomzo> smile back on woolies face
[2:36:56] <+krispen_wa> IS OWL A VERGIL?
[2:36:56] <+snugglepuggs> Ah right. Cuz u gotta attack his flank during phase 1 when does the helm splitter just like his roof fight
[2:36:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He is Dad P R I M E
[2:36:58] <Indigo_Automaton> Birb Dad don't play
[2:37:18] <%Lion_kun> Woolie having fun again
[2:37:19] <Ashenik1> this fight is so fucking good
[2:37:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @RyTYoung You didn't know? Eekum Bokum is Japanese for "starving wolf"
[2:37:21] <%Lion_kun> Yay
[2:37:34] <TigerClaws12> bitch you thought
[2:37:35] <samazam94> Woolie's smile and enjoyment: RESTORED
[2:37:40] <+snugglepuggs> Then he clone jutsus or bird jutsus in phase 2 if I remember correctly
[2:37:41] <Klefth> YEYE
[2:37:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its so nice to see woolie smile
[2:37:42] <+RyTYoung> @canadiananimatorguy oh god how did I not know LUL
[2:37:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Is it weird that owl has all your prosthetic tools and no prosthetic?
[2:37:48] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> he's definitely a parry boss for sure
[2:37:49] <Johannen> Woolie is his element, basic arena with 1 on 1 combat..so a fighting game)
[2:37:55] <%kewlmyc> Sounds like Woolie is having fun again
[2:37:56] <Coystick> Fucking jumped from behind a pillar to fire a shuriken at you I love it
[2:38:13] <jojomzo> Sekiro has 99 problems but boss fights ain't 1
[2:38:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Fuckin breaking news
[2:38:18] <nutimik> he only has fireworks, and those he just throws @fruit_pie_the_magician
[2:38:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Pancaked lol
[2:38:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EVO x Sony now
[2:38:30] <Klefth> Sweeps you counter by jumping
[2:38:41] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus I'm so glad you're enjoying this fight now. looking at you so dejected before was rough!
[2:38:46] <samazam94> FLAT
[2:38:47] <+AdlerDynamic> motherfucker hits so hard
[2:38:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> fireworks, poison
[2:38:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Are we finally getting money for tournaments? loi
[2:39:03] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Klefth he knows shhh
[2:39:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:39:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you're figuring it out dude, good attempts so far leaning his moveset
[2:39:16] <nutimik> you don't throw poison though, you use a knife. Most other ninjas use poison as well
[2:39:17] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Kinda sad this game never got dlc
[2:39:25] <Ashenik1> this and Glock are the best fight in the game
[2:39:27] <+TheNewZealandStory> maybe actually jump over the sweep and get some extra stamina damage by jumping off the boss
[2:39:28] <Afroperonista> take a sip
[2:39:42] <+livi242> sony bought evo
[2:39:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But my point still stands, why do we need a prosthetic to throw fireworks? Just because we only have one arm?
[2:40:08] <EX_shuffle> That evo news is crazy
[2:40:10] <samazam94> guys no backseating. let him figure out the fight at his own pace
[2:40:13] <NDenizen> dont dodge against this guy
[2:40:15] <Deasmeister> Thats wild
[2:40:17] <+snugglepuggs> I just realized that both Owl Father and the final boss are similar in that both phase ones are recycled boss mechanics until the final/next phase(s) of the fights
[2:40:21] <+snugglepuggs> Kinda cool
[2:40:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Yeah this fight is just pure skill and learning
[2:40:34] <Raldavar> Fighting dirty is the most honorable thing ou can eo as a shinobi. That and betraying your friends. "I was never on your side"
[2:40:34] <nutimik> because wolf isn't smart and doesn't carry around bags of shinobi goodies
[2:40:35] <+AdlerDynamic> yeah, the joy of sekiro is learning and overcoming obstacles
[2:40:49] <Flare3500> LOl there's no backseating it's literally git gud at these kinds of games
[2:40:50] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @fruit_pie_the_magician having a bunch of tools in one arm is handy
[2:41:07] <+b_aleph> sweep beats woolie
[2:41:11] <Klefth> On the one hand, cool since that secures a lot of money for evo and maybe it could lead to sweet prize pots. On the other hand... Yay playstation onry forever... :|
[2:41:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> If you hold block you just get your posture broken much faster
[2:41:34] <vVAstrAVv> you have to block to block
[2:41:35] <Coystick> Ew Sony bought evo
[2:41:49] <samazam94> @flare3500 i see a lot of jump this, dodge that from the chaf
[2:41:58] <+robosqueeb> This bossfight sure is a HOOT, haha get it chat?
[2:42:06] <NDenizen> no more boobs in Evo then
[2:42:13] <fangovafang> Gotta jump at dat one sweep

[2:42:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> chat what other bosses have woolie faced this stream?
[2:42:18] <Klefth> c o r e v a l u e s
[2:42:31] <%Lion_kun> This boss is a marathon. He has a shitton of posture, regens quickly and hits like a truck.
[2:42:37] <andre11dr> I'm not that surprised evo got brought, after 2020 they were in dire straits
[2:42:48] <Deasmeister> I love how he uses the smoke to cover his moves
[2:42:54] <NDenizen> that shadowfall
[2:43:00] <%Arancet> @ManlyMcBeefington none, just the miniboss to get here
[2:43:05] <+snugglepuggs> @manlymcbeefington Mini bosses. Doggos guy and fat guy and ninja
[2:43:13] <jojomzo> how come he can equip lots of special moves but u can only do 1
[2:43:14] <+krispen_wa> If sony bought evo does that mean smash players gtfo because nintendo?
[2:43:14] <ManlyMcBeefington> thanks chat
[2:43:40] <huskarl_zap> wtf sony bought evo?
[2:43:40] <NDenizen> what if Sony ONLY allows Melee out of spite
[2:43:51] <dmtjinni> chat is super chill today ^_^
[2:44:06] <+Invaderjaymz> You got this!
[2:44:22] <%Lion_kun> Chat, don't be shocked if Woolie spends the rest of the stream on this guy and doesn't win.
[2:44:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I love that woolie finally understands the combat it seems
[2:44:29] <samazam94> @dmtjinni oh you have no idea lol
[2:44:29] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> dude wtf he regens that posture fast, I think you gotta upgrade or be aggresive af
[2:44:33] <SilverFaustX> sony just bought evo
[2:44:48] <%Lion_kun> He's arguably the hardest boss in souls.
[2:44:49] <NDenizen> best to learn the fight before targeting health
[2:44:57] <huskarl_zap> Posture is a non factor for enemies since hour 2
[2:44:59] <Klefth> @The_Forgotten_Alligator Posture recovery goes down with health
[2:45:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @The_Forgotten_Alligator You have to get enough health damage in to ensure it doesnt regen that fast or just never stop attacking
[2:45:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oh, he'll sure as hell get it by the end of this fight if he doesn't yet.
[2:45:20] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> oh yeah I forgot
[2:45:21] <+krispen_wa> is this fight harder than laurence, the first asshole?
[2:45:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @krispen_wa Yes, easily way harder
[2:45:47] <Klefth> Yeah, harder
[2:45:47] <+tigerfang86> I'd say so, personally
[2:45:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well, you don't have to repeatedly parry laurence
[2:45:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Because laurence is easy hot take
[2:45:54] <NDenizen> laurence is just a flailing hitbox
[2:45:57] <+krispen_wa> okay but is it harder than the two sharks in the well?
[2:45:59] <Jackomaning> I find there are only 3ish fights that you actually need to wittle the health down
[2:46:00] <NDenizen> you cant cheese Owl with Arcane
[2:46:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I dont know why people find him hard tbh
[2:46:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:46:05] <samazam94> lawrence is cheap. i wouldnt even compare tbe two
[2:46:05] <+tigerfang86> nobody can defeat the sharks
[2:46:06] <%Lion_kun> His posture regen becomes manageable at half health
[2:46:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @therealgreatergamer I'm a fan of the never stop attacking method
[2:46:15] <+tigerfang86> nobody has ever, defeated those sharks
[2:46:16] <kotl7> nah the sharks are harder
[2:46:18] <samuelfisk> I find Laurence harder, just because there is nothing to learn with him.
[2:46:25] <+Joe2187> You could try using the ravens feathers if you're having issues
[2:46:31] <Johannen> @krispen_wa I dont think anyhting ever toped that bs, Nioh 2 might have something thou
[2:46:32] <%nabby1> is this the final boss?
[2:46:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Ow
[2:46:41] <%nabby1> not too familiar with this game
[2:46:42] <Klefth> Nah
[2:46:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I found him incredibly easy since you can just circle strave him and body him
[2:46:49] <Jackomaning> This is a bonus boss
[2:46:50] <+tigerfang86> it's an optional superboss
[2:46:56] <%Arancet> @nabby1 no, but its arguably on par or harder than the final
[2:46:59] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Sure does look like a final boss huh? xD
[2:46:59] <%CptnCampy61> EVO bought by SONY
[2:47:00] <NDenizen> its a secret boss but its final boss difficulty
[2:47:00] <+krispen_wa> outside of the bottom levels of the abyss i dont think anything in nioh 2 is on sharks level
[2:47:01] <TheKillerStove> @nabby1 nope, optional side boss for an ending path
[2:47:03] <+Joe2187> the final boss is....something amazing
[2:47:14] <+Joe2187> is Woolie going to play the final final boss?
[2:47:17] <+mecha_11> What do you do about his firecrackers? Umbrella?
[2:47:21] <Klefth> Ya, the final boss is spectacular
[2:47:25] <Coystick> Good moves
[2:47:34] <%patriotrenegade> wait didnt you kill this guy already
[2:47:44] <huskarl_zap> dont know where sony get its money from
[2:47:46] <+Joe2187> alternate version
[2:47:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't even think theres a cheese for this boss aside from some sort of arcane distance manipulation to limit his moveset or some shit
[2:47:48] <Johannen> Final Boss? This young spry Owl Ninja? Nah.
[2:47:49] <sporeian94> This is the second hardest boss in the game imo
[2:47:51] <kotl7> @mecha_11 I used to dash through and hit him in the ass
[2:47:53] <TheKillerStove> @patriotrenegade This is a memory of him in the past
[2:47:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You dont fight Owl, Owl fights YOU
[2:47:56] <+krispen_wa> sony gets its money from gacha
[2:48:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> This guy is the ultimate trickmaster, but the Final Final Boss is still the superior warrior.
[2:48:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Dont even THINK of engaging first lmao
[2:48:03] <%nabby1> Owl (Chad)
[2:48:03] <jojomzo> Chopped
[2:48:03] <samuelfisk> I run through the firecrackers before they ignite.
[2:48:07] <%Lion_kun> This is the hardest boss.
[2:48:20] <Klefth> @huskarl_zap Being one of Japan's largest corporation and having a presence in almost every industry will do that lol
[2:48:25] <Equirah> @CptnCampy61 you have fgs coming exclusively on PS consoles so it was to be expected EVO would get a sponsorship going
[2:48:25] <%Lion_kun> Demon of hatred took me 15 tries.
[2:48:27] <+Joe2187> I really still think Woolie could benefit from using Ravens feathers
[2:48:31] <NDenizen> I just block fireworks with shield tbh
[2:48:35] <Sloavon> Does Woolie remember the goomba stomp?
[2:48:35] <NDenizen> cheesy peasy
[2:48:36] <+mecha_11> @kotl7 @samuelfisk ah that makes sense
[2:48:38] <TheManWhosHot> either this, the final boss or the demon of hatred are the absolute hardest
[2:48:39] <%Lion_kun> Owl Father took me 5 hrs
[2:48:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EVO will still be open to all consoles
[2:48:45] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I think this boss is No.2 Hardest
[2:48:49] <andre11dr> So chat now that we'll be looking at this boss for the next 3 hours, whatcha bumping lately?
[2:48:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "Come if you dare fath- Wait hold on wtf..."
[2:48:56] <Deasmeister> He a big boy
[2:49:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The DOH is more a giant bitch asshole than actually hard
[2:49:07] <JetpackMcQuack> I‚Äôm gonna hang your ponytail on my wall as a trophy
[2:49:10] <+krispen_wa> im doing a ds3 faith hyper mode run right now
[2:49:14] <%jinking79> scary part is this only the first health bar
[2:49:20] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus He fights dirty with his tools, why shouldn't you?
[2:49:23] <Speckster42> the less health he has the slower he recovers
[2:49:23] <%Arancet> lower hp means slower posture recovery
[2:49:26] <+TheNewZealandStory> oh god he's gonna lame it out
[2:49:26] <+Joe2187> The best strat is patience
[2:49:28] <+JingKaisean> yeah man, the game is mean
[2:49:29] <Klefth> Posture regen will go down with his HP
[2:49:33] <+Joe2187> react to him
[2:49:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Oil plus fire gets his health down pretty fast
[2:49:40] <samazam94> just learn his shit and git gud, pretty much
[2:49:43] <%Lion_kun> At half health his posture is manageable.
[2:49:49] <+RyTYoung> It's hard playing the aggressive/parry game, but it is the way
[2:49:52] <Johannen> Again with the Mortal Draw crutch
[2:49:55] <%jinking79> 473 of them
[2:49:56] <+tigerfang86> Mortal Draw main....
[2:50:04] <Coystick> It's a pretty kewl sword
[2:50:04] <PanicSwytch> I never used it
[2:50:06] <%CptnCampy61> @equirah It makes sense they would have to do something after last year. I was just surprised we‚Äôre getting online tourney in August
[2:50:07] <Jackomaning> mortal draw is arguably the best skill in the game
[2:50:09] <AhmCha> Mortal Draw is super popular in speedruns, right?
[2:50:10] <+Joe2187> Woolie is defeating himself
[2:50:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Trying to slingshot an ant here man.
[2:50:15] <+JingKaisean> it's ehhhhhhh
[2:50:17] <+tigerfang86> any high monk mains in chat bepEZ
[2:50:18] <+krispen_wa> its iaijutsu. how can woolie NOT love it
[2:50:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Yes it bodies and stunlocks most enemies often
[2:50:29] <NDenizen> once you get the OP Sakura Dance it's hard to use anything else
[2:50:31] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Faith hyper mode huh? Isn't that less damage than straight sword R1 in DS3 LUL
[2:50:34] <plaguedoctor_syan> to be fair Mortal Draw is awsome and is a good way to defeat this boss
[2:50:37] <fangovafang> THERE U GO
[2:50:39] <Coystick> Remember Kitetsu from Ninja Gaiden? Cursed swords rock
[2:50:39] <kotl7> high monk is the shit, that's the overhead kicks right?
[2:50:43] <freduba_> high monk is OD
[2:50:44] <Raldavar> Confetti, axe, etc
[2:50:51] <Deasmeister> Isn't there some way to get a even better mortal draw?
[2:50:52] <Jackomaning> I like ichimonji because it's free personally
[2:50:52] <Johannen> @krispen_wa He never used the actual iaijutsu in combat
[2:50:59] <+Joe2187> Ravens feathers is slept on
[2:50:59] <+krispen_wa> @andre11dr hey, we aint talking DS2 lightning spears now
[2:51:01] <pi_in_the_sci> SOny just bought Evo
[2:51:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Honestly he's too aggressive to actually lame out
[2:51:17] <+FrostedZaibatsu> same movements
[2:51:22] <+tigerfang86> he JUMPIN
[2:51:30] <Jackomaning> There is improved mortal draw. Blanking on how you get it
[2:51:35] <+TheNewZealandStory> @fruit_pie_the_magician that won't stop woolie from spending the next 45 minutes trying
[2:51:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can try, but he's going in 24/7 and the only solution is to go in harder
[2:51:52] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa At least DS2 has SOME useful magic, unlike DS3 LUL
[2:52:11] <+krispen_wa> lighting arrow exists
[2:52:17] <+krispen_wa> the only useful miracle
[2:52:18] <%Lion_kun> The only thing that makes this boss possible is he doesn't have hyper armor on the red attacks.
[2:52:42] <andre11dr> Actually now that im thinking about it DS2 had like 3 useful spells and then where all hexes
[2:52:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> FUCKED
[2:52:56] <Klefth> This fucker took me an entire morning
[2:53:15] <%Lion_kun> 5 hours.
[2:53:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:53:19] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> If anyone played a game about reaction speed before this game you will have an easier time
[2:53:22] <Jackomaning> I found this the hardest boss to learn but not the hardest to rematch
[2:53:25] <Raldavar> DS3 sunlight spear 1-3 shots non resistant bosses on NG+ it's great
[2:53:35] <+krispen_wa> hyper mode is actually pretty fun though. killing abyss watchers in 3 lightning spears and Pontiff in 5 was funny
[2:53:58] <Deasmeister> To be honest I found him hardest of all souls bosses except maybe freide
[2:54:12] <Klefth> @Raldavar And to think people say that faith builds are worthless after 1. Faith was the most fun I had in that game
[2:54:14] <+Joe2187> Half helf bar at least
[2:54:16] <Equirah> jumped instead of chugged
[2:54:19] <+tigerfang86> Fireworks stinger sounds like a DMC stinger upgrade
[2:54:20] <+megaman_sentinel> anti heal
[2:54:21] <+tigerfang86> I'll be real
[2:54:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> No he actually has always done that lol
[2:54:22] <Jackomaning> I srtuggle with Fire Isshin a lot but that's my least fought boss by far
[2:54:27] <%Lion_kun> I think he's the hardest boss Fromsoft ever made.
[2:54:32] <andre11dr> @raldavar It might, but even than DMB murk dagger does like double the damage of that
[2:54:44] <+krispen_wa> the hardest boss fromsoft ever made was defiled pthumerian descendant
[2:54:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I still dont know how the fuck to deflect the Shura final boss's one mind attack lol
[2:55:02] <NDenizen> most bullshit boss is defiled headless bloodletting beast
[2:55:08] <Equirah> Ahrdest boss FromSoft has ever mae is pre-Souls LUL
[2:55:11] <%Lion_kun> I never did chalice dungeons. Fuck that shit.
[2:55:14] <NDenizen> nothing comes close to the fury I experienced farming that thing
[2:55:16] <+mecha_11> He telegraphs his moves so quick. It's hard to predict.
[2:55:32] <Equirah> some of you clearly never played their older titles
[2:55:38] <haitakaa> dark souls starts with evergrace Kappa
[2:55:38] <Indigo_Automaton> Who wins in a fight? Owl or the Orphan of Kos?
[2:55:39] <Raldavar> @andre11dr more damage than a 1 shot? O.o
[2:55:46] <%Lion_kun> Owl.
[2:55:48] <+krispen_wa> owl 10 times outta 10
[2:55:55] <+SouLucha> I'd give it to Owl.
[2:55:59] <+krispen_wa> orphan isnt even the hardest boss in his dlc
[2:55:59] <%Lion_kun> I've one-shot Kos.
[2:56:00] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Owl would stagger KoS
[2:56:01] <Deasmeister> Owl all day
[2:56:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Cursed Corrupted Defiled Cannon Giant is the fucking worst
[2:56:07] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Owl, cause you can't build a cheese build like in Bloodborne
[2:56:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Owl would strangle Orphan with his own umbilical cord
[2:56:17] <+zaworldo> Owl no contest
[2:56:22] <andre11dr> @raldavar Nah ,ill be real im not so up to date with the DS3 op stuff now that DeS is out
[2:56:26] <Indigo_Automaton> God imagine Owl in beast form
[2:56:30] <+Zanzibar_Junker> KoS is easy
[2:56:33] <Jackomaning> Owl would adopt orphan and train him to follow his orders
[2:56:35] <+FrostedZaibatsu> The firework loops get you. you got it
[2:56:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Indigo_Automaton This is it
[2:56:42] <Klefth> Nice moves
[2:56:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> :P
[2:56:42] <+tigerfang86> the goomba stomp is so fun
[2:56:45] <+zaworldo> Owl beasted out is too strong
[2:56:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Literally a single touch from anything is death and all he has to do is swing his chains or shoot the ground
[2:56:53] <+SouLucha> LUL Orphan of Owl sounds pretty dope.
[2:57:00] <TheKillerStove> "A ninja is a ninja even in a dream... AWOOOO"
[2:57:01] <Jackomaning> Wolf is orphan of owl
[2:57:07] <andre11dr> All tho last time i did DS3 pvp i really seeing NO magic
[2:57:09] <+krispen_wa> pthumerian descendant can one shot you with an insta shotel throw THROUGH A PILLAR
[2:57:15] <Ashenik1> @SouLucha well you play as him tbh Kappa
[2:57:18] <Indigo_Automaton> @SouLucha Isn't that just Sekiro after this fight? LUL
[2:57:19] <+krispen_wa> pthumerian descendant can fuck off
[2:57:22] <+SouLucha> The BETTER Orphan of Owl.
[2:57:30] <An_Armed_Bear> Fuck the Descendant
[2:57:49] <+SouLucha> Owl just looking at his options, ya know?
[2:57:50] <+EySoyCoco> Give him some advice now Mihn
[2:57:52] <+TheNewZealandStory> woolie constantly panic jumping every time he gets attacked is working really well
[2:57:59] <andre11dr> At least Souls bosses are hard and good, unlike what Kings Field has LUL
[2:58:02] <Raldavar> Orphan still the undisputed hardest boss in all of soulsbore beating out Frieda, nameless king, Isshin, Owl, etc
[2:58:16] <+krispen_wa> nah orphan is weaksauce
[2:58:22] <%Lion_kun> Orphan is way easier.
[2:58:25] <+krispen_wa> NOW THE WITCHES OF HEMLOCK
[2:58:29] <+JingKaisean> man, just watching this is bringing back painful memories
[2:58:34] <NDenizen> Orphan is totally fair
[2:58:36] <+zaworldo> Didnt paige beat Orphan?
[2:58:38] <Matt_Cowdery> Why is orphan said to be so hard?
[2:58:40] <Ashenik1> what about laurence gys? Kappa
[2:58:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I love Owl's "LLLLLLLLOOOOOOK OUT!"
[2:58:53] <%Lion_kun> Orphan can be parry baited and backstabberd
[2:58:55] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Imagine Dark souls 4 bosse- eh I mean Elden Ring bosses
[2:58:55] <+MugenSandan> because Bloodborne is more popular than Sekiro
[2:58:58] <Indigo_Automaton> @krispen_wa *Hemwick. Now I'm imagining witches with Titanfall Hemlock rifles
[2:58:59] <balthazar758> woolieee
[2:59:00] <NDenizen> Take any unbalanced defiled chalice dungeon boss and its probably the hardest
[2:59:11] <andre11dr> Orphan is not that bad, except for that one 25 hour fight that shall not be named
[2:59:13] <Deasmeister> Once you start parrying orphan he's fine
[2:59:22] <+krispen_wa> whats the hardest nioh 1 +2 boss?
[2:59:29] <+krispen_wa> outside of bullshit duo fights?
[2:59:38] <Matt_Cowdery> I never had too bad of a time with orphan compared to fume knight or charmless iishin (who I still havent beat)
[2:59:41] <@Menitta> I had the hardest time with the snake in 2
[2:59:44] <%Lion_kun> Hardest bosses in Nioh are the DLC bosses.
[2:59:50] <@Menitta> granted I never played 1
[2:59:52] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @andre11dr what 25hour fight
[3:00:01] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa nioh 1 dlc guy in red armour I think
[3:00:04] <+krispen_wa> snake definitely is the hardest early game boss when you have few options
[3:00:17] <+krispen_wa> sanada was pretty hard, yeah
[3:00:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[3:00:18] <andre11dr> @the_forgotten_alligator Don't worry, it's a long story
[3:00:23] <+EySoyCoco> @krispen_wa shibata katsuie maybe
[3:00:26] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Yukimura Sanada
[3:00:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have a warped perspective on OOK because I played the DLC through on my NG+4 character and that bitch took me a week
[3:00:36] <+krispen_wa> katsuie got nerfed at least
[3:00:49] <%Lion_kun> NG+ though
[3:00:50] <Deasmeister> Damage is real high goddamn
[3:00:52] <samuelfisk> Running through the gunpowder saves a lot of trouble
[3:00:57] <Raldavar> Sped up Shuten Doji or Tate Eboshi
[3:00:59] <Frostydough1> Vampire lady from nioh 1 kicked my ASS was the first block i ran into
[3:00:59] <+EySoyCoco> really? did it a month ago and still was hell
[3:01:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He got the jump counter!
[3:01:10] <Raldavar> Or pre-nerf Itsumade
[3:01:18] <+tigerfang86> e x p l o d e
[3:01:19] <+krispen_wa> he had A LOT more tracking on his grab
[3:01:27] <Indigo_Automaton> Unlimited FIREWORKS
[3:01:29] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @fruit_pie_the_magician same story with me and Midir
[3:01:32] <Raldavar> Pre-nerf Itsumade made Ren look like a bitch
[3:01:54] <+krispen_wa> itsumade pre nerf was the actual final boss
[3:01:56] <Deasmeister> Hey mom why aren't my fireworks that good
[3:01:56] <Ashenik1> Ice Lady with Nobunaga in NIoh 1 are bulshit
[3:02:02] <laschoelmachooo> daaaaamn
[3:02:06] <+krispen_wa> nightmare bringer is a bitch in comparison
[3:02:08] <%WutangchickeN> Dude hits like a dump truck, but doesn't everything in this game?
[3:02:25] <%Lion_kun> Good thing this OST rocks, we'll be hearing a lot of it.
[3:02:25] <Indigo_Automaton> Just light Owl's pockets on fire to ignite all the firecrackers he's holding
[3:02:26] <laschoelmachooo> pretty much yeah
[3:03:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I got through the entirety of Nioh up to the Nobu/Ice bitch duo without ever using a talisman or a ninja tool, and they forced me to abuse them from then on
[3:03:35] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> how hard is Nioh
[3:03:41] <%Lion_kun> The side missions in Nioh 1 were unbalanced bullshit.
[3:03:54] <andre11dr> Man now that im seeing Owl again, im realizing that Moon Presence was pretty disappointing as a fight
[3:03:59] <%Lion_kun> Nioh 2 side missions were much fairer
[3:04:02] <+krispen_wa> nioh's difficulty is about a little harder than souls in NG
[3:04:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nioh is fucked hard until you know what you're doing sufficiently. Which could take you multiple playthroughs
[3:04:06] <Ashenik1> NIoh 1 has a fun combat until it doesnt...
[3:04:11] <Matt_Cowdery> yeah, moon presence was just a victory lap fight
[3:04:14] <laschoelmachooo> woolie getting greedy again xd
[3:04:16] <+krispen_wa> but later difficulty's depend on how well you optimize your build
[3:04:16] <Raldavar> We don't talk about Nioh 1 anymore. Not since 2 came out
[3:04:21] <+MugenSandan> Nioh by itself is pretty hard, but the RPG mechanics allow you to completely break the system in half
[3:04:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It sucks how fast Moon Presence dies because it has the best damn OST
[3:04:32] <%Lion_kun> Nioh 2 was super easy. I just made a broken regen build.
[3:04:34] <+krispen_wa> also Nioh 1's NG+ cycles were bullshit
[3:04:35] <Deasmeister> Yeah moon presence was just another flaily monster with one gimmick
[3:04:36] <%AyotoCorp> Has Woolie hit phase 2?
[3:04:42] <Indigo_Automaton> @TheRealGreaterGamer facts
[3:04:52] <JetpackMcQuack> my son
[3:05:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Like straight up your first 10-20 hours of Nioh you're going to be getting shat on constantly
[3:05:11] <andre11dr> There was supposed to be more to the Moon Presence but that shit got cut
[3:05:12] <+MugenSandan> I abused lightning status effects in Nioh to play the game at half speed lolololol
[3:05:38] <Raldavar> Once you get used to flux 1/2 it's smooth sailing
[3:05:43] <+mecha_11> Oh ok that worked
[3:05:44] <+krispen_wa> True Moon Presence is a fucking trip
[3:05:44] <deceitfulgemini> oooh that was hella smooth
[3:05:46] <Matt_Cowdery> @andre11dr I'd believe that, its impressive how good bloodborne was considering how much they cut
[3:06:06] <+krispen_wa> you can still fight it in some hacked chalice dungeons actually
[3:06:08] <Ashenik1> Moon Presence is a story boss to be fair
[3:06:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Caltrops+slowdown tags= immobile enemy. stack lightning on top of that, and then debuff their defense, and buff your attack, and then your problem dies in two hits
[3:06:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Moon Presence just needs more health lol
[3:06:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> and can't move
[3:06:49] <Raldavar> Seriously flux is the most important skill they don't have a tutorial for
[3:07:07] <+krispen_wa> flux turns Nioh from a soulslike into a character action game
[3:07:31] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> sounds like Ninja Gaiden type of action
[3:07:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:07:37] <andre11dr> If Moon Presence was a Pokemon would it be Dark Fairy?
[3:08:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> then you can even throw paralysis clouds on them while they can't get out of the way
[3:08:13] <Klefth> Or Dark Psychic
[3:08:26] <shinichizio> Ghost Normal
[3:08:31] <Raldavar> Nah it'll be a dragon/ghost cause what are dragons in pokemon anyway?
[3:08:43] <Ashenik1> we are doing it!
[3:08:50] <Jackomaning> association with the moon really indicates fairy
[3:08:53] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yoo lets goo woolie
[3:08:57] <$thespacerunaway> This shit is so intense
[3:09:00] <deceitfulgemini> ooooh let's goo
[3:09:16] <+kknutson4> Why does he not use the fireworks? Free hits
[3:09:16] <Klefth> Getting there
[3:09:20] <+MugenSandan> just wanna know has Woolie been able to do one deathblow thus far
[3:09:23] <deceitfulgemini> fuuuuck
[3:09:24] <TigerClaws12> Woolie LUL
[3:09:25] <Ashenik1> ;(
[3:09:29] <+Grayhammatter> oof, greed
[3:09:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> YOU CANT INTERUPT THAT SLAM WOOLIE
[3:09:30] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> OOOH
[3:09:34] <+MugenSandan> or has he not reached phase 2 yet
[3:09:36] <Indigo_Automaton> You've gotten a lot better Woolz
[3:09:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> OOOOF
[3:09:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> HES TOO STRONK
[3:09:41] <+kdallas_> this fight is so sick
[3:09:42] <+Grayhammatter> nice try
[3:09:42] <Ashenik1> these fights are fucking the best
[3:09:44] <+RyTYoung> So stronk
[3:09:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the greeeeeeeeed
[3:09:50] <Frostydough1> GREED but damn seeing that meter about to reach the end wouldve made me do it to
[3:09:51] <RainbowDealer> Go in on him!!!
[3:09:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but real good try tho
[3:09:56] <andre11dr> No we haven't reached fase 2 yet
[3:09:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is where the game is best anyway
[3:09:58] <$horse_oil> these bosses are really hard about learning deflect timings and when to be greedy
[3:09:59] <%Lion_kun> Best run yet
[3:10:04] <$horse_oil> owl dad is really hard tbh
[3:10:11] <Chipshandon12> i prefer the japanese version of this where its Owl (Brother)
[3:10:14] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> if you angle your jump right, you can get the stomp on him
[3:10:16] <+RyTYoung> "Take your time." doodOK
[3:10:18] <+MugenSandan> @andre11dr ty
[3:10:43] <TheKillerStove> @horse_oil If the final boss wasnt in the game, he'd be hands down the hardest fight
[3:10:44] <NDenizen> wat
[3:10:51] <$horse_oil> for sure
[3:10:55] <Ashenik1> learingin and first trying Sekrio bosses is the best shit but replayability doesnt exist almost :/
[3:11:06] <$horse_oil> woolie with the strong start here
[3:11:10] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts
[3:11:10] <+MoskoTTV> Woolie is starting to hit the rhythm
[3:11:12] <+krispen_wa> @chipshandon12 LUL
[3:11:25] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Only replayed it for the different endings
[3:11:28] <Jackomaning> I still struggle most with demon of hatred because it's very different than most of the fights
[3:11:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game gives you a choice, get in the zone or get fucked
[3:11:36] <+MugenSandan> I wonder if Sekiro has the same AI based on music rhythm like the souls games
[3:11:37] <+RyTYoung> @ashenik1 I'm probably gonna redownload it and play through it again, I did only play through it once when it came out
[3:11:38] <+MoskoTTV> MoskoTTV subscribed at Tier 1.
[3:11:38] <+Grayhammatter> nice interrupt
[3:11:49] <tacostarvedbeast> Focus
[3:11:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It only took Woolie the entire damn game to finally learn how to feel the rhythm of combat
[3:11:51] <%Lion_kun> DoH is a Bloodborne boss in the wrong game.
[3:12:11] <Ashenik1> @Jackomaning thats why its the ony fight in the formsfot games I just cheese wit it jumping off the ledge casue fuck taht boss
[3:12:12] <+Kaask> sleepy minh
[3:12:15] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> woolie doing solid, just needs more dodge attacks to whittle down owl's health

[3:12:37] <An_Armed_Bear> I wound up doing a hit-and-run strategy with this fight honestly
[3:12:44] <$horse_oil> woolie's doing really well, this is a super hard fight and if you don't play damn near perfect you eat shit
[3:12:53] <drk_sd> ouch
[3:12:53] <+MoskoTTV> God he hits SO HARD
[3:12:58] <An_Armed_Bear> He's so beefy and his posture recovers insanely fast
[3:13:00] <Ashenik1> is Minh falling asleep? LUL
[3:13:00] <Coystick> Why is (Father) in ()?
[3:13:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He STRONK
[3:13:04] <$horse_oil> your health bar might as well not exist
[3:13:13] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> The final boss of sekiro is the hardest of all the Soulsborkiro games
[3:13:13] <deceitfulgemini> coy, he's your pappy
[3:13:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DOH isn't THAT bad if you know when to use your hat
[3:13:19] <+krispen_wa> cause he's not the father of owls
[3:13:27] <tacostarvedbeast> Bushido blade mode activated
[3:13:27] <+krispen_wa> he's the owl (your father)
[3:13:28] <+RyTYoung> EY GET ME ONE TOO
[3:13:30] <$thespacerunaway> thespacerunaway subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[3:13:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> thoughts?
[3:13:32] <+MoskoTTV> How you holding up, Woolie?
[3:13:36] <+RyTYoung> You're doing alright Woolie!
[3:13:37] <andre11dr> No the silence is fitting
[3:13:39] <Coystick> @deceitfulgemini yea but why in brackets?
[3:13:40] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Owl 2 throws everything
[3:13:43] <Indigo_Automaton> You're doing good Woolie! Fight on!
[3:13:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Coystick Because the normal version has just nothing
[3:13:51] <%justcallmebobplease> There ARE cracks in the wall, Woolie, we promise - just keep bashing.
[3:13:52] <$thespacerunaway> He is doing really good
[3:13:52] <+RyTYoung> Take your time!
[3:13:54] <Klefth> Nah, this boss is fucked
[3:13:58] <%Arancet> thats what this fight is
[3:13:59] <Surfinbear> strapped in
[3:13:59] <NDenizen> this boss took me hours
[3:14:00] <+MugenSandan> Woolz these bosses are insane and you're doing amazing tbh, I was stuck on the final boss for nearly 10 hours by itself
[3:14:01] <NDenizen> we totally get it
[3:14:01] <%Lion_kun> You're doing very well Woolz
[3:14:02] <%LordSDB> All good! woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[3:14:03] <+Zanzibar_Junker> he's insane
[3:14:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nobody beats this boss in two tries
[3:14:05] <Louie_Salmon> This is arguably the hardest boss
[3:14:06] <+BeeComfy> Hello everyone after 3 years in Uni, We may have our first interview as a Developer
[3:14:07] <+SouLucha> We know, took us probably as long.
[3:14:07] <Matt_Cowdery> mr snips would show up
[3:14:09] <+luftraumm1> @woolieversus this is the best best part actually
[3:14:10] <+krispen_wa> @woolieversus this is the hardest fight in the game. dont regret it
[3:14:10] <andre11dr> Nah this is a REALLY hard boss
[3:14:10] <Zebroneath> no worries, Wools. You do you.
[3:14:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, This is the fight lmao :D
[3:14:13] <cumurasame> Woolie, get your ZENKAI BOOST
[3:14:16] <An_Armed_Bear> For once, Fromsoft put all the toughest fights at the end of the game. You're good.
[3:14:19] <Coystick> @TheRealGreaterGamer i see
[3:14:20] <JOHNNYROCKETFlNGERS> We're here for the j o u r n e y
[3:14:20] <+Jiggisnipe> the true experience
[3:14:21] <NumbF4ke> Its fine
[3:14:24] <freduba_> yeah but we in here
[3:14:26] <tacostarvedbeast> Ganbarimasu woolie san!
[3:14:27] <NDenizen> we expect this to take hours, honestly
[3:14:27] <TheKillerStove> Took me 6 hours woolie. Youre on excellent pace
[3:14:27] <Chipshandon12> this games great but when you hit a wall its just git gud. picking up nother weapon stlye, levels, etc all don't really exist or do much
[3:14:28] <Frostydough1> all good dude this is whatt the game is about, trial and error
[3:14:29] <+RyTYoung> This took me ages to beat also
[3:14:30] <%jonblnt> @BeeComfy CONGRATS
[3:14:33] <Indigo_Automaton> We understand, Owl DEMANDS focus
[3:14:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:14:34] <andre11dr> Dude i watch Souls streams all the time, this is fine
[3:14:37] <Chipshandon12> hlove sekiro but hate sekiro
[3:14:38] <+MugenSandan> Throw your corpse at him until he DROWNS
[3:14:38] <%SainEdge> yeah boss is hard, took me like 2 hours on my second playthrough
[3:14:39] <%baka_sugoi> VIDEO GAMES R HARD
[3:14:40] <%hologram_sam> that was fkin cheesy
[3:14:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You should be prepared for an entire stream dedicated to just the final boss alone lol
[3:14:49] <+Cyoctane> Anyone here watch The Happy Hob? Dude has no-hit this game dozens of times, he's crazy
[3:14:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also nobody cares about the endings, this here is the good part of the game
[3:14:54] <%hologram_sam> dodge, dodge back, dodge, fast projectile. what a jerk
[3:14:55] <+RyTYoung> Swing at him as much as possible
[3:14:57] <+krispen_wa> I'll gladly shit on woolie for other fights, but this one, no.
[3:15:01] <cumurasame> Does Woolie know about the game journalist who demanded an easy mode so he could "enjoy the story and gameplay" without putting effort in
[3:15:04] <%livlinn> shiaUGH shiaUGH shiaUGH
[3:15:11] <Deasmeister> Thats just how it be with souls he's doing fine
[3:15:14] <plaguedoctor_syan> Oh you guys would stop recording i would asume you would continue recording then cut when you beat the boss/pass the difficult part
[3:15:16] <Frostydough1> @TheRealGreaterGamer You're not wrong LUL watched a streamer stream the boss for about a week
[3:15:18] <+BeeComfy> @jonblnt not gonna lie I was watching the steam and got the email. I about screamed in my apartment
[3:15:23] <%hologram_sam> Sekiro should have an easy mode
[3:15:32] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> ah hel na
[3:15:33] <+BeeComfy> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[3:15:36] <andre11dr> If i can watch Lobos do Bloodborne with fist only, i can definitely watch this LUL
[3:15:38] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[3:15:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I know of a reviewer who used a hack to turn the game down to half speed
[3:15:46] <tacostarvedbeast> Sekiro should have a Pok√©mon snap mode
[3:15:49] <oceanmatt> has woolie taken a health bar yet
[3:15:53] <Johannen> Sekiro does have an easy mode, its under Youtube option
[3:15:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sekiro should wipe my ass for me
[3:15:58] <NDenizen> This game has a deflect-only run
[3:16:00] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[3:16:00] <Coystick> Owl's ponytail being tied like a giant shimenawa rope is so fucking cool
[3:16:00] <NDenizen> shits wild
[3:16:03] <Klefth> This fight reminds me of what it feels like to learn a savage fight in XIV
[3:16:06] <TheKillerStove> @oceanmatt Came up just short once
[3:16:06] <%baka_sugoi> PJSalt
[3:16:06] <%hologram_sam> agreed to these alt modes
[3:16:22] <CureMode_> LMAO
[3:16:23] <+RyTYoung> @beecomfy congrats on the good news! doodGood
[3:16:24] <Jackomaning> Did anyone else find this the easiest soulsborne game?
[3:16:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can totally rush him down
[3:16:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus your aggression is working well
[3:16:31] <cumurasame> btw, is Owl using gunpowder on his sword to cause explosions or is it some magic shit
[3:16:32] <$thespacerunaway> Yo the XIV metaphor is on point
[3:16:33] <+Zanzibar_Junker> You were on point already
[3:16:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> That comes after you look it up online to see how cool other people are at this game
[3:16:38] <+krispen_wa> @klefth at least you don't have to rely on OTHER people getting gud too
[3:16:38] <cumurasame> oh I just saw it he is lol
[3:16:45] <%justcallmebobplease> @Jackomaning I don't believe you are a human.
[3:16:56] <Johannen> @Jackomaning Yeah, i found it the easiest of them all, apart from DS2 but that's more BS than difficulty
[3:16:58] <+MugenSandan> THE FAKE OUT
[3:17:06] <+MugenSandan> I love this game
[3:17:09] <NDenizen> Owl scatters the powder first and then ignites it with a sword swing after
[3:17:10] <+BeeComfy> @RyTYoung Thank man!!!! glad to share it with some cultured rollback lovers
[3:17:15] <NDenizen> its ninjas I aint gotta explain shit
[3:17:17] <+fettsvett201> This fight gave me the most trouble
[3:17:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> My strategies were always just "attack until they block, then parry whatever they do and force them to block again"
[3:17:19] <shinichizio> @Jackomaning Did any other jorogumo find this the easiest soulsborne game?
[3:17:24] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Ds2 is the easiest when you come back to it after playing all of em
[3:17:38] <freduba_> get read
[3:17:38] <Sparda_blizzard> geez
[3:17:38] <+zaworldo> J ust gotta get a little farther every time
[3:17:52] <+krispen_wa> DS2 is harder after playing all of them because its paced way slower
[3:17:52] <Klefth> Yeah, DS2 is probably the easiest. Or DeS since once you know the game you can pull off some busted shit LUL
[3:17:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I feel bad for Minh since he just has nothing to contribute lol
[3:17:55] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus please consider using Mist Raven
[3:18:00] <+krispen_wa> better to do it first
[3:18:03] <$horse_oil> the fact that he can cancel his ichimonji into two different follow ups is super busted
[3:18:08] <dirtyloser1997> is it just me or does woolie not look like he's have fun playing this game? what made him come back to it?
[3:18:10] <+RyTYoung> @beecomfy You know us, we love our rollback here woolieSPICE
[3:18:15] <andre11dr> For me oddly enough, DS3 was the easiest one,but i do think that it's because bye the point you get to DS3 you know what to do in Souls game
[3:18:17] <+BeeComfy> Damn bro, I feel like he might be frustrated
[3:18:20] <tacostarvedbeast> Woolie is close to going super saiyan I can feel it
[3:18:22] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Owl 2 is an SNK boss
[3:18:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @horse_oil You just have to time it so that you dodge right when he swings
[3:18:24] <Klefth> How does Mist Raven even work? I never got to do anything useful with it
[3:18:32] <deceitfulgemini> oh to be launched by fireworks
[3:18:34] <NDenizen> its a super dodge basically
[3:18:42] <+PlatinumRevol> Firecracker swipe dodge to top left
[3:18:45] <+b_aleph> Broken Woolie
[3:18:45] <PanicSwytch> If DeS, DS 1, 2, 3 and Bloodbourne don't have easy mode, why should Sekiro have one?
[3:18:46] <+BeeComfy> @RyTYoung *Insert average roll back lover meme of chiseled meme
[3:18:49] <Canadian_Suit> @Klefth when you use mist raven and get hit, you just don't get hit and teleport to the sides
[3:18:57] <+RyTYoung> Same
[3:18:58] <+SouLucha> I honestly beat this boss the way Woolie is trying. It'll take time.
[3:19:03] <+krispen_wa> @panicswytch there is easy mode. its summoning
[3:19:06] <+robosqueeb> humble brag
[3:19:08] <Klefth> Yeah, every time I tried I just ate the hit. Weird
[3:19:09] <+robosqueeb> lmao jk
[3:19:10] <+tigerfang86> that health damage tho
[3:19:14] <+MugenSandan> mist Raven is better when the boss has lots of multi hit attacks and Owl only has maybe three hits in a combo most of the time
[3:19:15] <$thespacerunaway> Minh should talk less on this one, I feel woolies rage metter going up
[3:19:17] <+RyTYoung> @beecomfy LUL
[3:19:22] <Johannen> @PanicSwytch Cause it came later and has more awareness so normies ask for it
[3:19:23] <+Cyoctane> @TheRealGreaterGamer also its hard to talk to someone in the zone who is also frustrated, dont want to piss them off
[3:19:28] <dirtyloser1997> what made wooleie come back to this game?
[3:19:29] <heartlesshealer> Woolie CAN do it, I just hope it's still fun for him
[3:19:32] <+PlatinumRevol> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:19:39] <+tigerfang86> minh's huge oh no
[3:19:40] <+b_aleph> @thespacerunaway agreed, he should talk more
[3:19:42] <dirtyloser1997> minh ffs pls
[3:19:47] <Sonny_Firestorm> The fact that you can't restore the resource mid-battle like you could in BB is the problem. No incentive to use tools.
[3:19:54] <CureMode_> minh shush
[3:19:55] <+b_aleph> HARD FLEX
[3:19:56] <%justcallmebobplease> Minh stop taunting Woolie, come on.
[3:20:00] <NDenizen> best sekiro run is "all enemies replaced with Guardian Ape"
[3:20:00] <andre11dr> NICE SHILL PogChamp
[3:20:03] <+robosqueeb> now do it blindfolded
[3:20:03] <Klefth> It's like Ornstein when he gets stuck
[3:20:05] <%Lion_kun> I beat the boss with no prosthetics. Just proper pattern recognition.
[3:20:06] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> oh shit lol
[3:20:07] <OldManDeckardCain> after 3rd birthday it's not that easy to believe minh LUL
[3:20:09] <tacostarvedbeast> While doing your taxes
[3:20:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Sonny_FIRESTORM you can
[3:20:22] <+RyTYoung> Woolie can beat Ds 1 and 2 with pat yammering in the middle of fights guys it's k
[3:20:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean only three times, but you can
[3:20:34] <shinichizio> @Sonny_FIRESTORM You can, and it costs life like it did in BB. It also costs A LOT of life.
[3:20:37] <NDenizen> I can proudly say I beat the boss using every scummy trick in the book
[3:20:37] <Deasmeister> Mist raven's only super useful against attacks like that one guy before genichro where they have one super bad attack all of owls are bad
[3:20:38] <Coystick> @NDenizen Sekiro: Shadows go Ape
[3:20:41] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> "You know what I mean"
[3:20:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Don't worry about advice too much. You're doing great! Just focus on learning the fight.
[3:20:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> @fruit_pie_the_magician if you're talking about the ritual dagger, it has a 3 use limit.
[3:20:52] <%Seancicle> KPOPfan KPOPfan KPOPfan
[3:20:56] <Chipshandon12> i just cheated in spirit emblems so i could actually use them for bosses like bloodvials in bloodborne. farmable but a waste of time
[3:20:56] <+PlatinumRevol> This is good tho. Download that man
[3:21:03] <+PlatinumRevol> Open your third eye
[3:21:06] <+kknutson4> Keep your distance and bait out the moves that can be punished easier
[3:21:06] <andre11dr> Actually now that im thinking about it ,Woolie never actually played DS3,huh
[3:21:14] <shinichizio> Man the reply dialogue blocking actual chat sure is a good feature, thanks Twitch
[3:21:23] <T_Sasquatch> Ping pong ping
[3:21:32] <+SouLucha> Yeah, I don't begrudge whatever trick you use to get through this game. It's what makes this game so great!
[3:21:33] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yea woolie watched pat play it
[3:21:39] <Coystick> I wonder how much of Sekiro's combat is gonna make it into Elden Ring
[3:21:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:21:42] <glass_marcus> I think woolie play it on his own
[3:21:51] <Deasmeister> I wish spirit emblems just regened on rest to encorage more use of them
[3:21:56] <Canadian_Suit> try just taking a break for 1 minute and breathe
[3:22:02] <+krispen_wa> elden Ring has jumping at least
[3:22:04] <zhukis> Woolie, remember to blink
[3:22:12] <T_Sasquatch> @deasmeister welcome to fromsoft and inconvenience
[3:22:17] <An_Armed_Bear> yeah I tried to go full aggro on him and it just didn't work well
[3:22:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What is Minh's youtube channel?
[3:22:26] <Punnyshment> punnysRyupoggers
[3:22:27] <+Zanzibar_Junker> wait for the scream
[3:22:28] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> @Coystick The Elden ring leaks making it look like Dark Souls 4
[3:22:28] <+drakthebest> @woolieversus when you are attacking and you see the orange spark that means he parries you and responds with his own very specific attack. This is the reason that aggressive play is better, you limit the boss‚Äô moveset
[3:22:33] <andre11dr> @coystick Well from the leaked stuff, ER does seem to have stealth and jumping so who knows
[3:22:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I want to verify this guy actually beat the game lmao
[3:22:46] <%Seancicle> inequitable trade damage
[3:22:52] <fangovafang> Has he tried da shield counter?
[3:22:55] <vVAstrAVv> be aggressive AND dont face tank
[3:23:01] <+RyTYoung> @therealgreatergamer he did, Mihn has guides to beat bosses on his YT channel
[3:23:01] <T_Sasquatch> @therealgreatergamer Minh is a demon gamer
[3:23:07] <+drakthebest> @therealgreatergamer he streamed it stop being a dumbass lol. Literally just look it up
[3:23:12] <andre11dr> I do hope ED is a fusion between DS and Sekiro
[3:23:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> yes, what is his channel?!
[3:23:28] <+krispen_wa> Why doesn't woolie simply use Crystal Soul Spear?
[3:23:45] <+tigerfang86> woolie should just use chaos bed vestiges
[3:23:49] <+tigerfang86> 4Head
[3:23:55] <+b_aleph> @TheRealGreaterGamer soushin sen
[3:23:57] <tacostarvedbeast> Is there a souls like explanation for why these dudes are so huge?
[3:24:01] <+PlatinumRevol> Good ichimonji!
[3:24:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @drakthebest Dont call me a dumbass you wont answer my question
[3:24:07] <andre11dr> Like give me Sekiro stealth and jumping with DS3 combat and DS2 built variety and you have something amazing
[3:24:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @b_aleph Thank you
[3:24:09] <+zaworldo> He just needs to drop his shield
[3:24:13] <+drakthebest> They aren‚Äôt huge, sekiro‚Äôs just a tiny man
[3:24:14] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie should just win the game 4Head

[3:24:33] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> woolie should just switch to playing Baiken
[3:24:50] <+gr8typhoon> Has Woolie heard about EVO "partnering" with Sony/RTS
[3:25:00] <+krispen_wa> @chester_goes_berserk but why play a low tier
[3:25:03] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> THE GREEEED
[3:25:04] <andre11dr> Woolie should just use that one DS2 hex and one shot Owl
[3:25:19] <+RyTYoung> @therealgreatergamer sorry couldn't find his YT but his twitch is soushinsen
[3:25:30] <+b_aleph> @krispen_wa so you can rage quit and call the other guy a scrub
[3:25:31] <vVAstrAVv> just use the blue blood glitch lol
[3:25:34] <+klooswep> Woolie's definitely getting the patterns. He's got this even if he fails a few more times.
[3:25:35] <xdeathknightx> Just know that Pat once said something was impossible in FFXIV and that Minh was actually doing that impossible thing.
[3:25:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Damn, he actually beat this game. WTF how. He's so wrong, so often lmao
[3:25:45] <Teh10sorrow> Have they gotten to phase two yet?

[3:27:44] <T_Sasquatch> Streaming fromsoft games must be hell. I did logarius like 20 times before i killed him
[3:27:46] <%jinking79> All Anwser = NO
[3:27:55] <NDenizen> rofl
[3:27:55] <DatAsuna> and to be fair NOW that's impossible cause it forces you to pick a class
[3:28:03] <Sparda_blizzard> footsies
[3:28:05] <DatAsuna> but that was a patch change
[3:28:23] <T_Sasquatch> I was legit stuck on the first boss of sekiro for so long LUL
[3:28:23] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> which is harder phase 1 or phase 2, don't remember
[3:28:24] <+krispen_wa> @datasuna i'd be impressed if he got to raids and managed to parse super high as a lancer
[3:28:24] <kotl7> oh shit he's learned
[3:28:25] <+PlatinumRevol> Never seen him do spear from that close
[3:28:49] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa he didn't show his parse but apparently he was pulling his weight

[3:46:47] <Blinge_Sadface> Woolie - Mikiri counter! Also his slow overhead... delay your dodge and it's an easy punish

[3:48:55] <+DeaconBluesClues> how many attempts on dad ninja 2
[3:48:58] <andre11dr> OGA
[3:48:59] <An_Armed_Bear> owl with the frame traps
[3:49:01] <+krispen_wa> many attempts
[3:49:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 3
[3:49:07] <Blinge_Sadface> @velgaduere it's interesting.. if you dodge early he adapts, but if you wait then dodge it's a free punish
[3:49:08] <+krispen_wa> but good progress
[3:49:09] <Dirty_Dandere> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[3:49:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> This will be 3
[3:49:15] <+DeaconBluesClues> round to the tenth digit
[3:49:22] <velgaduere> @Blinge_Sadface really? interesting
[3:49:33] <samazam94> i just realized that Owl body and sword size reminds me of freaking Nagoriyuki
[3:49:34] <An_Armed_Bear> landed a grab
[3:49:36] <andre11dr> I think it's been like 2 hours on Owl
[3:49:37] <Blinge_Sadface> it's so good once you figure it out! like makes you hold your nerve
[3:49:38] <+legendfather_of_giants> scratching your nose like Pat?
[3:49:41] <+krispen_wa> The best thing sekiro did was add a pause button
[3:49:41] <penitentpendant> Owl throwin' pepper with them bombs
[3:49:41] <+RyTYoung> Praise the pause!
[3:49:41] <privatecorgi> Wow you can pause in this game
[3:49:45] <huskarl_zap> Ichimonji
[3:49:50] <Deasmeister> Pauseing is great
[3:49:57] <+krispen_wa> Why did souls not have a pause for offline
[3:50:00] <+DeaconBluesClues> is he using consumables to get motivated or "saving them for when it matters"
[3:50:00] <+krispen_wa> its dumb
[3:50:04] <%jinking79> good thing he learn phase 1
[3:50:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:50:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> lol
[3:50:20] <andre11dr> !uptime
[3:50:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 10 minutes
[3:50:26] <velgaduere> @krispen_wa "difficulty" :)
[3:50:26] <Blinge_Sadface> You can dodge his firecracker at 11 o'clock. the sword won't hit and you can punish.
[3:50:27] <+RyTYoung> @krispen_wa Nioh had it patched it for offline mode which I didn't realise since I was always online LUL
[3:50:29] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa game design?
[3:50:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @DeaconBluesClues He would have won the first time he got to phase 2 if he just used a grass instead of a pellet lol
[3:50:33] <+krispen_wa> THE WOMBO COMBO
[3:50:34] <huskarl_zap> I think owl hates fireworks if I'm remembering right
[3:50:34] <penitentpendant> @jinking79 Stop abusing crazy talk
[3:50:35] <An_Armed_Bear> the frame trap
[3:50:38] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus use consumables
[3:50:40] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> he caught you healin lol
[3:50:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> eat da candy
[3:50:50] <Matt_Cowdery> When he does his shiruken into forward horozontal slash, you can dodge through and punish him pretty easy
[3:50:54] <+krispen_wa> @ashenik1 shitty game design that assumes you dont have a life, sure
[3:50:57] <velgaduere> @penitentpendant I think rule number 1 of Crazy Talk is that it cannot be abused
[3:50:58] <%jinking79> doodLUL doodLUL
[3:51:07] <+Freakin_Wolfy> is Phase 2 the bird thing?
[3:51:25] <+RyTYoung> @freakin_wolfy yeah dad unleashes his stando
[3:51:29] <+DeaconBluesClues> @therealgreatergamer I beat owl 1 first try by just using a jizu statue
[3:51:30] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa I mean you can exit the game whenever you want, it saves everything if you have to leave the game ;d
[3:51:31] <+legendfather_of_giants> @krispen_wa differing functions based on whether or not you have a connection is hard
[3:51:38] <An_Armed_Bear> wat
[3:51:39] <+Freakin_Wolfy> lol, thanks. I never got him to phase two
[3:51:44] <penitentpendant> @velgaduere There's always a cost when using another person's stand
[3:51:49] <andre11dr> Yo dad caught you sipping in some cough juice and he was like, NONE OF THAT SHIT
[3:51:54] <deceitfulgemini> whoa new swipe?
[3:51:56] <therakishsage> Minh telling it how it is.
[3:51:57] <Chipshandon12> try a run with no thoughts of healing
[3:52:01] <Blinge_Sadface> can we @ woolie with tips or is that not appreciated?
[3:52:05] <+Freakin_Wolfy> that's how you learn
[3:52:10] <+krispen_wa> @legendfather_of_giants i mean, they have a bonfire toggle off for invasions, it cant be thaaaaat hard
[3:52:11] <huskarl_zap> Oh it's the madam butterfly upgrade. It makes him fullstop.
[3:52:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> @therealgreatergamer which leads to an Easter egg, actually! you know how he yells instructions at you when you die? he has more than 2 things on his list...
[3:52:21] <therakishsage> I think Woolie wants to conquer this challenge on his own. @Blinge_Sadface
[3:52:22] <penitentpendant> @Blinge_Sadface He's labin', leave him be
[3:52:22] <velgaduere> your previous gameplan was working just fine, you got this
[3:52:28] <Blinge_Sadface> kk thanks guys
[3:52:33] <+RyTYoung> You gotta keep experimenting to find out better openings
[3:52:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @DeaconBluesClues Yeah
[3:52:43] <velgaduere> he's got it now lobosPog
[3:52:44] <Blinge_Sadface> Yep. experimenting always valid.
[3:52:45] <+legendfather_of_giants> @krispen_wa yeah, but even at a bonfire, enemies still do their AI pattern
[3:52:50] <+krispen_wa> @ashenik1 yeah, until you hit that boss battle and get it to 10% health and then someone doorbells
[3:52:53] <RodCU> Have you guys told Woolie that EVO got bought by Sony?
[3:52:54] <+DeaconBluesClues> so they very clearly expect people to eat their freaking lifegems
[3:52:56] <Robot_Nixon_> its RAW
[3:52:58] <cumurasame> The reason Woolie is losing because Pat isn't here to coach him
[3:53:02] <+RyTYoung> @rodcu NANI
[3:53:17] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> he cancels the move dependin on what you do
[3:53:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> has woolie tried dropping his shield
[3:53:19] <RodCU> @RyTYoung check twitter
[3:53:24] <+DeaconBluesClues> @krispen_wa sekiro has a real pause
[3:53:29] <Blinge_Sadface> Figuring it out for yourself over many attempts, this is the process. this is the best part of from softgames. I cry!
[3:53:35] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa :<
[3:53:41] <+krispen_wa> @deaconbluesclues which is why i praise this game for having it
[3:53:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> you can literally pause, stop, and think about shit, which I did in many fights
[3:53:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh and his damn "hints"
[3:54:00] <+RyTYoung> @rodcu yooo
[3:54:07] <Blinge_Sadface> yes!!!
[3:54:16] <+MoskoTTV> Late dodge lets you punish yep
[3:54:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh wtf are you talking about Woolie understand it
[3:54:17] <RodCU> @RyTYoung yeeeh that's big
[3:54:18] <NDenizen> its just positioning
[3:54:31] <shinichizio> The fact that Owl cancels and swings at you instead of just sticking a magic tracking magnet to his sword is good.
[3:54:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> NO MINH
[3:54:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> early dodge lets him track you, late dodge baits the vert
[3:54:44] <stormhawk9891> What?
[3:54:51] <Blinge_Sadface> communication suffering between "dodge" and "sidestep "
[3:54:58] <Robot_Nixon_> @RodCU that is, glad evo is saved. now im curious what sony's gunna do with it
[3:54:58] <Matt_Cowdery> Minh is making something simple more complex
[3:54:59] <andre11dr> Minh is confusing me and i already beat this boss
[3:55:00] <+krispen_wa> Minh is definitely NOT what Woolie was for Reggie for Demon Souls
[3:55:12] <Blinge_Sadface> hahahah. i think the word they want is " strafe "
[3:55:15] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh, Woolie gets it
[3:55:18] <RodCU> @Tuna_Can_0 See me in Play Station All Stars
[3:55:18] <stormhawk9891> No seriously Minh, WHAT!?
[3:55:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Same difference Ming, it doesnt matter
[3:55:22] <Coystick> Owl and Sekiro are playing Shogi behind the pause screen rn
[3:55:22] <NDenizen> Making the simple complicated is what Minh does
[3:55:23] <+dangerzoneoverload> dangerzoneoverload subscribed with Prime.
[3:55:33] <+OblivionSword1> Woolie ignore Minh for now
[3:55:33] <+DeaconBluesClues> I do not understand any of this bc beating owl for me involved eating candy and casting confetti and then using mortal blade 58 times in a row
[3:55:42] <Robot_Nixon_> @RodCU PogChamp lol
[3:55:42] <dmtjinni> Minh giving great notes
[3:56:05] <penitentpendant> @stormhawk9891 It's not the timing of the dodge, it's Sekiro's position relative to Owl for whether he Option Selects into the spin. If you go close to Owl but not too far and behind he won't OS.
[3:56:05] <+krispen_wa> DED
[3:56:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh turned a 1 sentence explanation into a 3 page dissertation
[3:56:09] <andre11dr> Yeah Woolie definitely tried harder with Reggie than Minh is trying here LUL
[3:56:22] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus EAT CANDY
[3:56:24] <NDenizen> "he changes his attack based on your position"
[3:56:25] <NDenizen> there
[3:56:28] <Raldavar> Minh
[3:56:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol
[3:56:32] <Blinge_Sadface> hahahah
[3:56:32] <RodCU> So Woolie doesn't seem to know about the EVO news then
[3:56:41] <+DeaconBluesClues> what evo news
[3:56:43] <andre11dr> NO
[3:56:46] <Aydarkzero> @RodCU whats going down?
[3:56:47] <velgaduere> @RodCU it's really not important right now
[3:56:47] <+krispen_wa> Sony bought Evo
[3:56:52] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> what minh is saying if you dodge while still in front of him he will not cancel his move
[3:56:56] <Aydarkzero> WOAH
[3:56:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> whaa!at
[3:56:58] <Sonny_Firestorm> D:
[3:57:00] <ioriac> like the event?
[3:57:02] <huskarl_zap> Capcom sold?
[3:57:06] <CoffeeSlice> LUL

[3:57:17] <Matt_Cowdery> Iishin
[3:57:19] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:57:20] <snallygasty> hi woolie and chat
[3:57:20] <+Freakin_Wolfy> APATHY IS DEATH
[3:57:23] <Blinge_Sadface> Hesitation is defeat.
[3:57:25] <velgaduere> @ioriac no, only the "o"
[3:57:26] <andre11dr> Hesitation is defeat
[3:57:26] <+robosqueeb> lmao dude
[3:57:28] <brian_peppers1> what the fuck
[3:57:38] <+duckpuncher49> Hesitation is DEFEAT
[3:57:43] <andre11dr> WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET MINH LUL
[3:57:45] <2deep5u> mr. tengu
[3:57:45] <Blinge_Sadface> how are these guys friends lmao. imagine every conversation liek this LUL
[3:57:51] <KingOfTheGeats> I don't think he says that until the final boss
[3:57:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Hesitation is preferable to communism
[3:57:55] <samuelfisk> Isshin didn‚Äôt like that.
[3:57:55] <RodCU> Hesitation is Defeat, words to live by
[3:57:58] <shinichizio> He says it all the time
[3:58:00] <%Seancicle> Disciplined
[3:58:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> -Liberty Ishin
[3:58:09] <%whyskeywolfe> You know, the old man who says hesitation is death, Grampa Simpson
[3:58:12] <velgaduere> oh so now there are 3 scenarios, when earlier he said 2. got it NotLikeThis
[3:58:18] <NDenizen> lmao velga
[3:58:20] <Blinge_Sadface> getting hit is a scenario
[3:58:21] <+duckpuncher49> @blinge_sadface lmao
[3:58:25] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Hesitation is defeat except when the opponent also hesitates, in which case hesitation is victory
[3:58:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[3:58:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> Chop, Swipe and Jump Swipe, there's some overlap.
[3:58:45] <%jinking79> good wall jump
[3:58:47] <+sevorai> tbf he said 3 scenarios he first timet
[3:58:49] <+krispen_wa> Hesitation is a pause made out of lacking confidence in one's actions
[3:58:54] <Blinge_Sadface> m i k i r i b o y s
[3:58:57] <Raldavar> A wise man once said: "Hesitation is defeat. Risk it for the biscuit"
[3:59:03] <SirCacaPee> destroyerRAMBO destroyerRAMBO destroyerRAMBO
[3:59:07] <NDenizen> "if your opponent hesitates, you lose" - Justin "brownface is ace" Trudeau
[3:59:13] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Pretty sure he says Hesitation is defeat to sekiro when you talk to him multple times
[3:59:18] <snallygasty> I still haven't beaten tou-san part 2 cuz I Accidentally skipped this first on my first run
[3:59:35] <Blinge_Sadface> weird scramble situations can still happen in this fight. its chaotic
[3:59:37] <RodCU> Hesitation is Defeat = Shake and Bake
[3:59:48] <Blinge_Sadface> Hesitation Show Feet
[3:59:52] <%whyskeywolfe> The problem with this boss is he's super-tough and makes me cry.
[4:00:06] <SirCacaPee> Pure silence
[4:00:08] <Blinge_Sadface> PogChamp
[4:00:25] <blackbaron98> silent hype
[4:00:30] <deceitfulgemini> we back in the zone???
[4:00:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Actually hitting the boss and interrupting their combo thus throwing you off rhythm has killed me more than actually missing deflects lol\
[4:00:58] <huskarl_zap> Owl's real name = Baruto
[4:01:00] <RodCU> is his name Owl because he is wise?
[4:01:07] <%jonblnt> shaper1LETSGO
[4:01:09] <Blinge_Sadface> I love how parries, dodges, jumps and positioning are all part of the combat. when people say "it's just a rhythm game" they wrong bro
[4:01:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> His name is Owl because he has a fucking Owl
[4:01:19] <+krispen_wa> His name is owl because he can turn his head 180 like a backstabbing traitor
[4:01:20] <Blinge_Sadface> ahahah
[4:01:20] <RodCU> oh shit
[4:01:20] <Ashenik1> dont hesitate when you commit a genocide guys

[4:11:33] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> historically accurate japanese warlord tbf
[4:11:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He killed Sekiro and then when Kuro revived him he was like OH SHIT I CAN USE YOU BOY
[4:11:48] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus he stabbed you from behind
[4:11:58] <Klefth> Pretty much. Japan used to be real fucked
[4:12:00] <Johannen> Owl totaly killed you in the OG memory
[4:12:02] <%whyskeywolfe> Honestly the simple truth is Owl's plans and motivations are not well explained.
[4:12:09] <Ashenik1> Is Sekiro more historiacly accurate than Ghost of Tshusima? Kappa
[4:12:10] <Blank9> he stabbed you from behind in the original memory
[4:12:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Ming wtf are you talking about
[4:12:20] <Timarkot> Isn't this a "what if" part?
[4:12:21] <Blank9> you died so you didn't know
[4:12:21] <Hydrapissed> yah owl just wanted to be immortal thats about it
[4:12:24] <Johannen> Is Mihn talking about the original memory ending where he kills you?
[4:12:28] <NDenizen> Centipede Apes, part of actual japanese history
[4:12:31] <%baka_sugoi> STATUE
[4:12:32] <+Zanzibar_Junker> The dragon curse after the lady butterfly fight
[4:12:38] <Klefth> It's the cutscene after you kill grandma. Owl backstabs Wolf @WoolieVersus

[4:12:39] <primaryfire> after you defeat lady butterfly, wolf gets stabbed from behind and kuro revives him, which starts the immortality thing for wolf
[4:12:39] <%SainEdge> this is the "wrong" memory, the first one is the right one i think
[4:12:39] <Matt_Cowdery> I think its when you fight lady butterfly
[4:12:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Its not even clear if these memories are like real or not
[4:12:44] <%jinking79> isn't that the Ladybutterfly fight
[4:12:53] <samuelfisk> Minh, You‚Äôre confusing it with after Lady Butterfly.
[4:12:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Backstabbed by a sword that just happens to be like 7 inches wide
[4:13:04] <andre11dr> Now for DoH Kappa
[4:13:09] <Hydrapissed> even owl is confused on ur fake arm
[4:13:10] <Sonny_Firestorm> Give Umu the rice.
[4:13:11] <Ashenik1> HE SAID IT
[4:13:15] <+Freakin_Wolfy> don't bring logic into this, Woolie
[4:13:16] <huskarl_zap> This game is weird
[4:13:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> HE SAID THE WORD
[4:13:18] <Indigo_Automaton> CONV-
[4:13:20] <shinichizio> Owl even mentions it. He's like 'the hell happened to your arm, boy'
[4:13:21] <+OblivionSword1> very convoluted
[4:13:22] <Robot_Nixon_> dont worry about it :)
[4:13:22] <NDenizen> Time is conv-
[4:13:23] <Klefth> Umu boi
[4:13:25] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus you see that after Lady Butterfly, but it's not explicitly Owl, it's just a sword that looks EXACTLY like his
[4:13:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> CONNIPTIONS
[4:13:28] <Ashenik1> if it cool dont matter
[4:13:29] <Deasmeister> The flow of time...
[4:13:40] <+DeaconBluesClues> did he do demon yet
[4:13:44] <Klefth> Time is convoluted in Ashina
[4:13:45] <@Solidus_113> no
[4:13:46] <Louie_Salmon> The move bosses around up to a month before these games come out, all the lore is nonsense
[4:13:47] <Afroperonista> plot holes? nah, time is just convoluted bro
[4:13:48] <squigginster> the flow of time is convoluted in japan
[4:13:49] <Ashenik1> rice PogChamp
[4:13:52] <+DeaconBluesClues> because demon is so much harder
[4:13:55] <andre11dr> What's the deal with time Kappa
[4:13:57] <NumbF4ke> Has woolie gotten the serpents viscera?
[4:14:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @NumbF4ke Yes
[4:14:05] <NDenizen> yummy centipede eggs
[4:14:06] <Matt_Cowdery> @legendfather_of_giants it is confirmed it was him when you fight on ashina castle tho, since he tries to kill wolf the same way
[4:14:12] <CoffeeSlice> sekiro you moron
[4:14:13] <NumbF4ke> Nice
[4:14:16] <MeMillionthDollar> Lol Sekiro is an animal
[4:14:19] <+klooswep> ya gotta cook it idiot
[4:14:20] <penitentpendant> It'd be mechanically disorienting if you had your arm in the memories and lost all the 'powers' it gave you. Though I suppose that would make them more challenging.
[4:14:26] <@Solidus_113> Has Sekiro been eating raw rice this whole time
[4:14:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Kuro <3
[4:14:29] <penitentpendant> *real arm
[4:14:33] <andre11dr> If only we could kill time itself, now that would be a cool fight
[4:14:36] <+OblivionSword1> eating raw rice sucks though
[4:14:38] <Matt_Cowdery> Men will literally eat uncooked rice rather than go to therapy
[4:14:39] <Ashenik1> Kuro and his tea shop :3
[4:14:43] <lyzejag> Dudes rock

[4:14:53] <+legendfather_of_giants> @Solidus_113 I mean he is just dumping it down his throat for emergency healing
[4:14:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @OblivionSword1 Kuro will comment on exactly that lol
[4:14:57] <+DeaconBluesClues> @andre11dr you're not tricking me into playing chrono cross
[4:14:58] <CoffeeSlice> Kuro is alright
[4:15:09] <%Theycallmenerf> Sony bought EVO?

[4:18:09] <NDenizen> its not clear
[4:18:09] <+legendfather_of_giants> @Johannen yeah, but you don't get an item from it until this time
[4:18:25] <velgaduere> bro this is a fromsoft world, no tea shop or nice thing will ever open again
[4:18:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[4:18:39] <Dirty_Dandere> The Boy woolieYE woolieYE
[4:18:39] <samuelfisk> Kuro is going to work at Iroh‚Äôs teashop
[4:18:43] <%Lion_kun> save that rice for emergencies
[4:18:44] <+RyanTheRecluse> different flavour text
[4:18:44] <%Theycallmenerf> Sekiro, still doesn‚Äôt grab me like Dark Souls, DeS or Bloodborne.
[4:18:45] <+Standard_Enemy> Eat up piggy
[4:18:59] <%illtima> Fucking Internal Ministry'
[4:19:04] <%whyskeywolfe> ookami-oh intensifies
[4:19:04] <penitentpendant> @Theycallmenerf It lacks build diversity
[4:19:11] <andre11dr> Man the Sekiro dialogue just isn't written as good as DS dialogue
[4:19:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Go talk to Emma
[4:19:30] <+krispen_wa> its cause it doesnt have a bunch of somber british people being depressed
[4:19:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You can
[4:19:34] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Kuro voice in English is literally the text to speech kid
[4:19:34] <NDenizen> Any game that doesnt have British stage and soap actors as the NPCs is gonna be a weird experience
[4:19:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I think I liked Sekiro so much when I first played it bc it was my first From game, now that i've played bloodborne and seen demon souls i can see how... different this game is
[4:19:45] <primaryfire> the tengu names you sekiro so the reveal is when isshin also calls you it
[4:19:46] <Ashenik1> @andre11dr yeah, casue it wasn written by Miyazaki
[4:19:50] <+drakthebest> It actually is. There's just more of it so you have enough quantity to tell how bad it is (the dialogue)
[4:19:52] <linSP> rice rice rice
[4:19:54] <penitentpendant> @NDenizen So all hail FF12?
[4:20:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie?
[4:20:02] <Johannen> @andre11dr I have the complete opposite impression, i love Sekiro dialogue and characters way more. DS was so basic and cheesy
[4:20:03] <Afroperonista> Kappa
[4:20:03] <NumbF4ke> He hasn't fed the viscera yet right? He would get the pure rice otherwise
[4:20:06] <%Theycallmenerf> @penitentpendant I was at least hoping the prosthetic arm would adapt boss moves in a way, like maybe 1 or 2 uses only per whichever boss you take their ‚Äòsoul‚Äô or power or technique from. Like how Boss Souls had unique spells or weapons.
[4:20:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She is a child?
[4:20:08] <velgaduere> she's probably like 16
[4:20:10] <%ZweihanderSteve> 15 billion
[4:20:10] <+krispen_wa> FF12 ALL DAY BABY
[4:20:12] <Afroperonista> old enough? Kappa
[4:20:13] <+mecha_11> Not really
[4:20:13] <lyzejag> Just the voice actress i guess
[4:20:15] <stormhawk9891> She IS a child
[4:20:21] <velgaduere> a teenager is still a child imo
[4:20:21] <Ashenik1> is about legal
[4:20:23] <+legendfather_of_giants> she's like 15-16
[4:20:29] <Gamer76255> Sounds like Rika
[4:20:34] <Dirty_Dandere> The Daughter woolieGIRLS woolieGIRLS woolieGIRLS
[4:20:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Shes actually 5000 years old officer
[4:20:44] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> it's just the voice, she's a tall kid
[4:20:44] <velgaduere> "hey may be"
[4:20:46] <Blank9> sekiro goes around telling everyone rice balls taste good
[4:20:47] <%justcallmebobplease> 'HEY' may be?
[4:20:55] <Coystick> INTERIOR MINISTRY OPEN UP
[4:20:56] <penitentpendant> @Theycallmenerf Unfortunately they went with a 'megaman tool' choice. And made it so the tools wouldn't liquidate the bosses like in Megaman.

[4:21:20] <Klefth> His name is umu
[4:21:21] <samuelfisk> I love how serious Sekiro is about rice.
[4:21:27] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Black lord
[4:21:33] <penitentpendant> As long as she's not a 500 year old child and we need to summon the FBI again
[4:21:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lol Playstation bought EVO
[4:21:39] <+DeaconBluesClues> @samuelfisk food is some serious shit
[4:21:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just rest now
[4:21:49] <deceitfulgemini> is sekiro voiced by takuya kuroda or am I just hearing a lil kiryu in him
[4:21:51] <huskarl_zap> blackout god
[4:21:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> And talk to her
[4:21:53] <Slam_Punk> @CanadianAnimatorGuy We still got CEO
[4:22:06] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus you shouldn't need to eat rice, but there is more quest
[4:22:17] <%Theycallmenerf> @penitentpendant Missed opportunity in my eyes. Could‚Äôve made bosses recognize moves and instantly change to instead of a 2 stage they rebuff and enter a 3rdish stage that‚Äôs more enraged that Wolf is copying fallen comrades etc.
[4:22:34] <PanicSwytch> u need to eat her rice to continue i think
[4:22:39] <OldManDeckardCain> why is makoto from yakuza 0 giving rice to woolie again Kappa
[4:22:39] <Coystick> It's so sad, Sekiro likes sweet things but has to drink bitter gourd juice all day
[4:22:40] <TheMK90> Just saw Zack Snyder's Justice League... 10/10! A must-see movie!
[4:22:59] <Equirah> @TheMK90 4/3 Kappa
[4:23:02] <%Theycallmenerf> @penitentpendant also I just wanted Bloodborne 2. The fact it wasn‚Äôt still disappoints me :/
[4:23:06] <+luftraumm1> @themk90 really?
[4:23:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheMK90 LUL
[4:23:08] <shinichizio> 5/7
[4:23:12] <penitentpendant> @Theycallmenerf It's one of the biggest problems compared to their other games. There's only the 'parry build' in this game. So there's so much less replay value for it.
[4:23:14] <huskarl_zap> Return to monke
[4:23:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> Return to Monke
[4:23:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She's talking to all the dead kids :D
[4:23:17] <NumbF4ke> I'm pretty sure woolie also needs the book from the monk temple, unless he already got it
[4:23:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monke
[4:23:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NumbF4ke pretty sure he has it
[4:23:40] <squigginster> praying to the pillar
[4:23:47] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus you did miss the peddler sidequest, it's exclusive with the fat monk's
[4:23:49] <velgaduere> best boi
[4:23:49] <NumbF4ke> Good
[4:23:50] <PanicSwytch> I sent him to the merchant
[4:23:51] <TheMK90> @luftraumm1 It's perfect! Now I want a Zack Snyder's Justice League part 2 xD
[4:23:53] <+drakthebest> The vast majority of people don't replay games, who cares that Sekiro doesn't have much replay value, it's for a very, very small subset of players anyway
[4:23:53] <NDenizen> KONY 2012
[4:24:01] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's weird that monks get spirited away if you fan them.
[4:24:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Swing your sword around Kotoro the big monk for a cool easter egg. Im not trolling, its actually cool and kind of sad
[4:24:11] <penitentpendant> The super persimmon
[4:24:14] <samuelfisk> NumbF4ke, if he doesn‚Äôt have it, the Child will ask him to get it.
[4:24:22] <%jinking79> remembering Pat was told to fan him super early missing the side quest
[4:24:23] <Johannen> @NumbF4ke The book is not in the temple itself but is in the water or if you get to the temple early enough you can get it from the head immortal himself
[4:24:24] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> OH SHIT SWING THAT SWOD
[4:24:24] <Equirah> @PanicSwytch you bastard! LUL
[4:24:25] <lyzejag> EAT IT NOW
[4:24:27] <%Lion_kun> dead kids
[4:24:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damn now I want a persimmon
[4:24:42] <PanicSwytch> @equirah LUL LUL
[4:24:44] <velgaduere> best boi forgotten
[4:24:50] <Sonny_Firestorm> Monk sitting in the forest.
[4:24:56] <+mecha_11> How does persimmon taste?
[4:25:00] <linSP> isn‚Äôt that taro persimmon just a unique one time consumable that‚Äôs not important
[4:25:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ^^^^
[4:25:08] <NDenizen> You know it's a souls game because there's an NPC that only tells you to go away
[4:25:15] <+legendfather_of_giants> it's just a good item
[4:25:16] <samuelfisk> linSP, yes
[4:25:23] <Johannen> @mecha_11 Its tangy and kinda "numbs" your mouth, they are overrated
[4:25:55] <penitentpendant> Sekiro 2: Journey to the West
[4:25:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[4:25:56] <+mecha_11> @johannen numbs your mouth?? That's weird. Thought it'd be a little sweet maybe.
[4:25:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mecha_11 not too sweet but just a little, i've never had it numb my mouth tho
[4:25:59] <huskarl_zap> Buddist Nirvana Stand around while monkey throw poo
[4:26:15] <velgaduere> YAPPP
[4:26:18] <Ashenik1> HER LIPS MOVE
[4:26:19] <Zayasu> oi
[4:26:25] <%Theycallmenerf> Sekiro 2: Shadows Backdown Twice
[4:26:25] <@Solidus_113> Fromsoft will never learn lipsync
[4:26:30] <huskarl_zap> invisible monkey poo
[4:26:33] <Johannen> @mecha_11 It does not "numb" but i dont know how to translate the specific word in english
[4:26:42] <%Lion_kun> lip syncccccc
[4:26:42] <Deasmeister> At least they move at all haha
[4:27:00] <Ashenik1> @Solidus_113 but isnt it thier first game with lips moving? LUL
[4:27:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's a Chinese style dragon, right?
[4:27:18] <+krispen_wa> how does Fromsoft put so much effort into art and gameplay, but not into the actual jank normal conversation
[4:27:20] <Timarkot> Oh god i remember the weird ending now
[4:27:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> F o r e i g n C o r r u p t i o n
[4:27:24] <%Lion_kun> JOURNEY TO THE WEST
[4:27:31] <+legendfather_of_giants> @Spudnacious_Dynasty eh, the Chinese and JP dragon style are kinda interchangable
[4:27:34] <%Theycallmenerf> Lipsync will be a build for Elden Ring, calling it now.
[4:27:40] <NDenizen> tbh game studios put way too much effort into NPC conversations
[4:27:44] <Johannen> @krispen_wa Cause it does not matter in the long run
[4:27:57] <NDenizen> I've always liked the minimalist approach in Souls
[4:27:58] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa they don care I guess
[4:27:58] <Slam_Punk> HeyGuys good fortune
[4:28:06] <Matt_Cowdery> @mecha_11 it depends on the strain of the persimmon, but in general they are very unpleasant before they are ripe, but after they are ripe they lose their bitterness and are just a sweet starchy fruit, very rich
[4:28:08] <Johannen> Its not like you are having a ful on converstation face to face
[4:28:15] <%Lion_kun> best ending
[4:28:25] <Ashenik1> Arent Japanese dragons just Chinese dragons?
[4:28:28] <%Lion_kun> put your lord in a little girl so you can hunt down a dragon in the west
[4:28:29] <samuelfisk> I prefer Purification
[4:28:34] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Because fuck it ,we rather put our effort into brick detail LUL
[4:28:45] <+legendfather_of_giants> not long, there's a teleporter in the same room @WoolieVersus
[4:28:47] <Louie_Salmon> When you google it
[4:28:49] <+krispen_wa> they expect you to ask on the internet
[4:28:51] <+Standard_Enemy> Took me like half an hour lol
[4:28:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i would have assumed she was just gone
[4:28:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Not long since I came here often because im OCD and constantly recheck all NPCS
[4:29:02] <andre11dr> Who the fuck knows
[4:29:03] <Deasmeister> After looking at the wiki haha
[4:29:04] <Timarkot> This is where dead divine children go
[4:29:06] <Johannen> I instantly went here cause its the closest
[4:29:06] <Matt_Cowdery> It's very souls-like, to not tell you wtf you have to do
[4:29:06] <lyzejag> When you google it, it's a Souls game
[4:29:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Swing your sword around Kotoro the big monk for a cool easter egg. Im not trolling, its actually cool and kind of sad
[4:29:07] <vVAstrAVv> you have to go through here to get to her so id start here
[4:29:11] <Ashenik1> Well I would have checked guide Kappa
[4:29:13] <+penjaza> Anyone who says this isn't obtuse is kidding themselves. There is a logic to it but it's not a logic most can follow
[4:29:16] <andre11dr> I just looked it up
[4:29:18] <PanicSwytch> everyone googled it
[4:29:20] <+mecha_11> But you would have been prompted to look at least.
[4:29:31] <%SainEdge> i mean she tells you the monkeys are her friends. Plus this place has a teleporter in her backyard
[4:29:32] <+mecha_11> Once you realized she was gone
[4:29:40] <Johannen> It is the closest place that is tied to her and location, its not obtuse at all
[4:29:41] <penitentpendant> Souls questlines are basically "Just google it"
[4:29:43] <therakishsage> Yeah, that's about how FromSoft does things, it's kind of their thing at this point.
[4:29:50] <+SouLucha> Where else would she even go?
[4:29:58] <linSP> this is almost as bad as finding lucatiles poison grotto hiding spot in DS2
[4:30:01] <andre11dr> But.you only do this once because YOU DON'T GET SHIT FOR IT besides some moves
[4:30:02] <vVAstrAVv> its her front yard people cool it lol
[4:30:04] <%jinking79> u can just rest
[4:30:20] <+krispen_wa> OOOOH ELDEN RING will be even more obtuse since they can hide NPCs in a massive world
[4:30:29] <samuelfisk> Main Hall
[4:30:30] <andre11dr> Or do you even get moves?
[4:30:45] <radar410> This ending is actually not that hard to get if you're super autistic about exhausting all the dialog like me LUL Certainly infinitely easier than FromSoft's other hidden endings.
[4:30:47] <%Theycallmenerf> The Elden Ring run of all NPCs clipping into the environment including the tutorial boss
[4:31:13] <PanicSwytch> Oh the statue
[4:31:22] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus ninjitsu is about backstabs, not stealth stabs
[4:31:22] <Deasmeister> From backstab
[4:31:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its from Backstabs
[4:31:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Also just keep going and you'll find it
[4:32:03] <andre11dr> Elden Ring better have just one set final boss
[4:32:08] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can learn the skill to jump after breaking posture for a backstab even mid combat
[4:32:12] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus that's why you can get Vault Over to get in-battle ninjutsu
[4:32:15] <andre11dr> Like DS3
[4:32:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus That's why 'Jump over the enemy" is a skill you can unlock
[4:32:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I hope Elden Ring has 20 finas bosses
[4:32:23] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> missed opportunity to not jump scare the player here
[4:32:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just keep going forward
[4:32:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It will literally be in front of you
[4:32:51] <Ashenik1> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Oh my fucking God LUL
[4:32:54] <+SouLucha> He's a corner along with other dead monks.
[4:32:58] <+legendfather_of_giants> no ti doesnt
[4:32:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[4:33:50] <huskarl_zap> DRAGON TEARS?
[4:33:53] <andre11dr> @canadiananimatorguy You say that as a joke but some SMT games do actually do that
[4:33:59] <huskarl_zap> ELDERSCROLLS? PogChamp
[4:34:40] <penitentpendant> Chaos or Law boss for Elden Ring
[4:34:41] <linSP> the way woolie reading the item descriptions is the same way I read bible verses in catholic school
[4:34:42] <Johannen> Does anyone here ever put the idol on the hotbar? I only used it from the menu cause its faster and more convinient
[4:34:48] <penitentpendant> DLC will be Neutral boss
[4:35:03] <andre11dr> That would be cool
[4:35:15] <+FlubbedPig> Are they aware that this ending has no additional boss fights or anything?
[4:35:15] <huskarl_zap> Resident Evil?
[4:35:16] <+Standard_Enemy> I wish more games did the hidden final boss(es) thing more often. Adds a bunch of replay value if done well
[4:35:20] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> oh shit I forgot you can actually talk to the priest before he dies
[4:35:48] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus you can talk to the priest if you do the temple before Genichiro
[4:35:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Get ready for that Pandora's Tower shit
[4:36:01] <penitentpendant> @Standard_Enemy When you look through the "True Final Boss" trope for game suggestions
[4:36:07] <Johannen> @The_Forgotten_Alligator That dude looks crazy, i was amazed at that secret
[4:36:30] <Ashenik1> GTFO stupid foreign dragon, we are about to go into Edo Era !!!
[4:36:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUNCH TIME YUM YUM :D
[4:36:42] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yeah guy was weird but he gives you the book

[4:37:09] <Hydrapissed> STILL IN A DREAM
[4:37:20] <penitentpendant> "Cradle"? Is she storing the dragon in her womb?
[4:37:20] <huskarl_zap> Eat the Mcmuffin
[4:37:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> To be fair, it sound HORRIBLE.
[4:37:27] <Johannen> From does not condone Vore
[4:37:30] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:37:32] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[4:37:37] <velgaduere> this seems like it was a good idea
[4:37:39] <+legendfather_of_giants> @penitentpendant maybe
[4:37:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> TURN IT UP YUM
[4:37:41] <NDenizen> [yakuza quest noise]

[4:38:29] <@Solidus_113> oh
[4:38:29] <Raldavar> Interior ministry, open up!
[4:38:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She's blind now
[4:38:30] <velgaduere> "hey so I fucked up"
[4:38:33] <+Standard_Enemy> It's either questionable grunts or blood curdling screaming no inbetweens
[4:38:39] <The_Nerd_Supreme> What are you doing Step Kuro? Kappa
[4:38:54] <+SouLucha> A meal so bad it turns you blind.
[4:38:58] <OldManDeckardCain> no that's the makoto I remember Kappa
[4:38:59] <UnfilteredComic> Now you can touch the darkness within
[4:39:04] <+Awkward_Cyborg> keikau!
[4:39:06] <penitentpendant> 300% proof fruit

[4:39:15] <velgaduere> Elsa PogChamp
[4:39:22] <Hydrapissed> we fed her poison and now she cries frozen tears man sekiro u a dick
[4:39:30] <%Lion_kun> With this, all ending conditions unlocked.
[4:39:31] <Klefth> Of course
[4:39:31] <%jinking79> just give her some dice she'll get snake eye
[4:39:33] <NDenizen> What happens when you combine McGuffins
[4:39:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> YEAH
[4:39:35] <primaryfire> of course
[4:39:37] <+loukemia83> That sounds about right
[4:39:38] <velgaduere> now you have the macguffin of the eastwest
[4:39:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> This is the most WTF ending for sure lol
[4:39:41] <shinichizio> Yeah, That Makes Sense
[4:39:46] <PanicSwytch> This is common sense
[4:39:46] <Indigo_Automaton> She cries Dippin' Dots
[4:39:52] <Johannen> Of course, it makes as much sense as Guilty Gear Lore
[4:39:54] <jorniev> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
[4:39:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> WAIT TILL HE SEES THE CUTSCENE :D
[4:39:57] <+Standard_Enemy> Just like I learned in grade school
[4:39:58] <UnfilteredComic> WITH THE DRAGON TEARS

[4:40:01] <linSP> bitch use a freezer next time
[4:40:05] <+penjaza> You can finally do the Dragon again
[4:40:06] <+robosqueeb> minh
[4:40:07] <+Zanzibar_Junker> BETTER THAN NIOH
[4:40:08] <andre11dr> Men ,this is a bunch of shit to just save some kid and fuck off to China or Korea
[4:40:08] <%cache_22> Don't you love FromSoft questlines?
[4:40:13] <OldManDeckardCain> makes perfect sense, just like eating mormons in takeshi's challenge
[4:40:14] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus Guilty Gear lore
[4:40:15] <+karawra> so logical and easy to find
[4:40:16] <penitentpendant> All these sidequests make a square
[4:40:19] <vVAstrAVv> woolie why are you acting like it doesn't make complete sense lol
[4:40:24] <velgaduere> I did this irl literally yesterday, it's just common knowledge
[4:40:25] <@Solidus_113> I know writers who use subtext, they're cowards
[4:40:26] <%Lion_kun> no not sever immortality, we're gonna put the kid in her
[4:40:33] <+krispen_wa> FromSoft's idea of a more involved main quest is just shoving macguffins everywhere
[4:40:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> REQUEST RICE
[4:40:37] <%Lion_kun> then we'll hunt down the dragon in the sequel
[4:40:38] <jorniev> WOW that face
[4:40:38] <Ashenik1> @Solidus_113 LUL
[4:40:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> REQUEST RICE :D
[4:40:50] <%DegenCat> ICE RICE
[4:40:52] <+SouLucha> MIND GOBLINS
[4:41:02] <velgaduere> (r)ice
[4:41:05] <Raldavar> feed the child good food
[4:41:08] <penitentpendant> @Lion_kun Definetly an awkward yet accurate phrase to describe the ending of this game
[4:41:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Rice UPGRADED
[4:41:23] <vVAstrAVv> how does she know if it shines
[4:41:26] <@Solidus_113> flash frozen rice
[4:41:28] <+b_aleph> TRUE RICE
[4:41:32] <Johannen> Chilled Ice...the new DivineBucks Coffee
[4:41:33] <Hydrapissed> YAH THIS makes sense
[4:41:34] <vVAstrAVv> who told her it did?
[4:41:38] <+SouLucha> Ice - R
[4:41:39] <shinichizio> ahhh, yum COLD snow
[4:41:40] <andre11dr> God please don't let The Elden Ring be a dumb macguffin and be an cool concept
[4:41:41] <PanicSwytch> Cold rice
[4:41:43] <Deasmeister> A little bit of snow
[4:41:44] <jorniev> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE
[4:41:45] <huskarl_zap> cold rice DansGame
[4:41:55] <penitentpendant> Rice Cream?
[4:41:56] <+Jiggisnipe> what
[4:41:57] <+Zanzibar_Junker> BETTER THAN NIOH
[4:41:58] <Deasmeister> snort that stuff
[4:42:03] <Blank9> mmmm cold raw rice
[4:42:03] <Johannen> Cold Starch, same with Potatoes
[4:42:04] <Pandora_Prime> All this just to make the two kids smash
[4:42:05] <CoffeeSlice> (r)ice cream
[4:42:12] <velgaduere> it's first grade, Spongebob
[4:42:13] <%baka_sugoi> STICKY RICE
[4:42:20] <jorniev> i like rice
[4:42:25] <Ashenik1> Nioh had better story Kappa
[4:42:30] <+Awkward_Cyborg> make rice pudding with it
[4:42:30] <jorniev> POPOL VUH
[4:42:33] <+krispen_wa> Nioh's storytelling is fucking trash, but i cared far more about Tokichiro than anyone in Sekiro
[4:42:38] <NDenizen> once per playthrough

[4:42:41] <Equirah> @Pandora_Prime bruh, you have no idea
[4:42:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can give it to her it isnt special or important, just dialogue
[4:42:44] <+legendfather_of_giants> only 1, it's justa mediocre item
[4:42:45] <jorniev> I FUCKING LOVE CORN YOU GUYS
[4:42:47] <%LordSDB> Tea left over with some sugar can get real sweet when its cold
[4:42:49] <therakishsage> Kind of like how the whole purpose of the booze is to give it to certain people.
[4:42:57] <joefromsingapore> Will he "traid" Persimmon for Rice?
[4:43:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Yes
[4:43:02] <joefromsingapore> *she
[4:43:08] <@Solidus_113> you need to give it to her for a questline
[4:43:15] <samuelfisk> It‚Äôs immaterial. Choose what you like Woolie.
[4:43:16] <velgaduere> @Equirah we better see these kinds smashing at Final Destination
[4:43:27] <velgaduere> *kids
[4:43:28] <MeMillionthDollar> Nom nom nom
[4:43:34] <penitentpendant> It triggers extra dialogue if you give her that persimmon when she's sick, apparently
[4:43:34] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Tokichiro basically made Japan's feudal caste system
[4:43:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> REGENERATE YOUR BLOOD FOR ME
[4:43:36] <velgaduere> munch
[4:43:38] <UnfilteredComic> ITADAKIMASU
[4:43:40] <+SouLucha> Not Pats, or Goblins here... Only Woolie!
[4:43:40] <MeMillionthDollar> SUGOIIIII
[4:43:47] <%cache_22> Plus, she's blind so how would she know if you are there or not?
[4:43:47] <+legendfather_of_giants> subarashi
[4:43:47] <PanicSwytch> Did Woolie do the Doctor's side quest?
[4:43:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> <3 Best Girl <3 Best Boy
[4:44:06] <+legendfather_of_giants> @PanicSwytch yes
[4:44:09] <linSP> Don‚Äôt persimmons taste like gnarly tomatoes
[4:44:10] <Ashenik1> LUL
[4:44:11] <%jinking79> Evil Eyes
[4:44:11] <velgaduere> amazing
[4:44:11] <Hydrapissed> YES
[4:44:12] <+Awkward_Cyborg> so convoluted
[4:44:12] <jorniev> Inmortal sugimoto
[4:44:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She might still be at temple
[4:44:19] <+krispen_wa> SEVERAL HOURS OF FETCH QUEST
[4:44:22] <velgaduere> this all makes perfect sense
[4:44:24] <penitentpendant> And the alcohol to whoever needs more Social Drink Link
[4:44:28] <andre11dr> LUL
[4:44:29] <radar410> The flower is for another ending tho
[4:44:30] <Johannen> Woolie's spite is palpable
[4:44:31] <Deasmeister> Fetch that quest
[4:44:33] <+b_aleph> it's only natural to give the flower to emma!
[4:44:35] <andre11dr> SO MUCH BULLSHIT
[4:44:39] <vVAstrAVv> fetchquests die twice
[4:44:42] <Blank9> there's only like 4 npcs anyway
[4:44:42] <%Lion_kun> ELDEN RING LET'S GO
[4:44:45] <Equirah> @cache_22 right, cause blind people lose all other senses.....
[4:44:45] <jorniev> what a totally not obtuse questline
[4:44:48] <+SouLucha> Oh man, did Woolie hear that special conversation to get special dialog?! Kappa
[4:44:50] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus she's either up the stairs or at the temple
[4:44:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Dont question me, drink this child tear
[4:45:02] <Johannen> Giving the item the person asked for ..."Yep that's obvious..no problem or obtusnes here"
[4:45:04] <+Standard_Enemy> Don't forget to turn your controller upside down 12 times to ensure the final boss arrives on time and doesn't miss his phone call with the tax man
[4:45:14] <Hydrapissed> u are a ninja
[4:45:15] <velgaduere> maybe beating this questline unlocks a secret Elden Ring easter egg
[4:45:17] <+krispen_wa> Fuck, at least Nioh's story kind of makes sense if you know Sengoku history
[4:45:19] <linSP> then, you back up the game so you can reload the save before the end so you can see all three endings without having to replay the whole game two more times
[4:45:21] <+krispen_wa> This is just dumb
[4:45:24] <UnfilteredComic> Kuro, bite this onion
[4:45:27] <%Lion_kun> To unlock the secret ending of elden ring, make sure to beat the final boss with no armor when the moon is half full.
[4:45:38] <+SouLucha> Oh shit, this might be it actually!
[4:45:41] <2deep5u> are they going to finish it today?
[4:45:43] <Indigo_Automaton> Fight, Sleep, Eat Uncooked RIce, and Eavesdrop are all Sekiro knows how to do :(
[4:45:43] <andre11dr> It sucks you can't kill NPCs in this game, i would boot it up right now just to take revenge for this LUL
[4:45:44] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus eat the cookies she made for him right in front of him
[4:45:46] <Ashenik1> WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE?!
[4:45:55] <Hydrapissed> can sekiro do math?
[4:46:05] <velgaduere> @Hydrapissed only wolf-math
[4:46:09] <Hydrapissed> ah wolf math kk yah
[4:46:09] <jorniev> This is like the US of game design
[4:46:10] <+Zanzibar_Junker> The other bosses are just as nuts
[4:46:18] <+legendfather_of_giants> you're good now
[4:46:19] <+loukemia83> @2deep5u I don't think they will get past Hirata estate
[4:46:25] <Johannen> @krispen_wa I dont know Sengoku History and all i got from it that we were chasing some dude for our MonsterGirl. Kinda basic
[4:46:27] <Hydrapissed> DAD DOWN
[4:46:29] <andre11dr> But can Sekiro smash?
[4:46:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You're all set! Now when you beat the game you will have all options available to choose! :D
[4:46:49] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I think so
[4:46:49] <velgaduere> he's REALLY did, especially in my brain-hole
[4:46:56] <Equirah> @Hydrapissed probably nothing beyound the basic 4
[4:46:56] <velgaduere> dead, too
[4:47:00] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus you have the blossoma nd the frozen tears. you're all set
[4:47:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:47:07] <+krispen_wa> @johannen its basically that, but you're also nonchalantly killimg all of the cool historical figures and unifying japan at the same time
[4:47:17] <samuelfisk> I think they have everything.
[4:47:40] <andre11dr> We did all
[4:47:55] <+Zanzibar_Junker> you kill all the big samurai in nioh
[4:47:57] <PanicSwytch> Did he fight all the headless?
[4:47:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You're all set. You can now give a drink to whoever you havent to yet and fight the dragon! :D
[4:48:03] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa I mean here the story also makes sense? One Clan refuses to surrender to Shogun so Genichiro tries everything he can ;d
[4:48:04] <linSP> yes the flower and tears are the ending flag mcguffins and then its pick your mass effect ending
[4:48:19] <MeMillionthDollar> Re-Boof_ination
[4:48:23] <+legendfather_of_giants> Bad, normal, good and True @WoolieVersus
[4:48:37] <joefromsingapore> Purification best ending
[4:48:38] <andre11dr> But don't forget the umbilical chords
[4:48:38] <$QueequegTheater> Once you get the frozen tears and the aromatic sakura flower you're good
[4:48:46] <samuelfisk> I prefer Purification
[4:48:53] <$QueequegTheater> @joefromsingapore Nope, return
[4:48:54] <+krispen_wa> DID YOU GET THE FIREKEEPER EYES?
[4:48:54] <+penjaza> Technically the Dragon's Homecoming and the Purification are mutually exclusive
[4:49:06] <+legendfather_of_giants> you did
[4:49:07] <+Zanzibar_Junker> that's all
[4:49:07] <%SainEdge> i also like purification the most. But homecoming is also really cool
[4:49:08] <velgaduere> seems legit
[4:49:15] <therakishsage> You get some absolutely amazing bossfights for the Shura ending, which is kind of a bummer.
[4:49:18] <$QueequegTheater> Dragon's Homecoming is explicitly the best ending
[4:49:20] <+Standard_Enemy> We collected all the library cards
[4:49:20] <Canadian_Suit> man, woolie will lose it once he faces the final boss
[4:49:25] <linSP> and remember to hit the fire keeper as the screen fades away in the bad ending to get the SUPER secret ending
[4:49:25] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie plz LUL
[4:49:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You need the juice of the Venasaur before your continue
[4:49:31] <%jinking79> pretty have all the ending choose now
[4:49:32] <%Lion_kun> Homecoming is the best, you put your lord in a girl and then you go hunt a dragon.
[4:49:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Purification - You aim to sacrifice yourself with Owl's everblossom. Return - Divine Child becomes Cradle. Default - Kuro aims to sever immortality
[4:49:38] <andre11dr> Don't forget to talk to Yuria for the Lord of Hollows ending
[4:49:38] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus get malcontent
[4:49:45] <velgaduere> @therakishsage at least you can get to that point way more quickly than anything else
[4:49:49] <wibbwobbler> pretty sure you guys saw everything
[4:49:56] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus Malcontent is VERY good to get
[4:50:04] <%Lion_kun> Get the whistle upgrade
[4:50:12] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Malcontent and Fire umbrella is godlike
[4:50:16] <Canadian_Suit> MALCONTENT
[4:50:17] <+krispen_wa> remember to kill Vendrick first to unlock aldia's final boss
[4:50:18] <+penjaza> Malcontent is useful, the fire umbrella feels almost mandatory
[4:50:21] <NDenizen> get fire umbrella
[4:50:27] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Get the Phoenix shield, you'll need it
[4:50:35] <Majiinbooh> the feather is sick
[4:50:37] <%Lion_kun> oh shit, doesn't he need to kill the Shichimen first to get malcontent?
[4:50:45] <shinichizio> After all this work to get Woolie to drop the shield
[4:50:46] <%Lion_kun> the place where the 2 monkeys were?
[4:50:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie's gonna want that umbrella if he's doing the optional superboss
[4:50:58] <Indigo_Automaton> Flame Umbrella will be useful
[4:51:08] <+penjaza> You need to fight another Shishiman Warrior to get the item for Malcontent
[4:51:13] <%jinking79> Guardian Ape has it
[4:51:13] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you need that for Demon of Hatred
[4:51:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus I think that would be in the APE arena in the water
[4:51:22] <%Lion_kun> Go to the palce where the 2 monkeys were.
[4:51:22] <linSP> the ring is from a secret boss right
[4:51:23] <andre11dr> Go get a second katana so you can just push lock the final boss
[4:51:27] <@Solidus_113> Ashina Depths: Dropped from the Shichimen Warrior that spawns in the Guardian Ape's Burrow
[4:51:32] <@Solidus_113> for that ring
[4:51:41] <Canadian_Suit> YES YES YES
[4:51:42] <%Lion_kun> You need it for demon of hatred
[4:51:45] <samuelfisk> What you want more than anything is the Umbrellas
[4:51:46] <Speckster42> Malcontent does damage to one of the final optional bosses
[4:51:47] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus One EXTREMELY large one
[4:51:49] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus you need it
[4:51:56] <+loukemia83> Umbrella is more useful for demon, imo
[4:52:00] <%Lion_kun> Malcontent makes Demon of Hatred muche asier.
[4:52:01] <+loukemia83> flame one
[4:52:08] <%Lion_kun> Woolie doesn't care at this point, he said as much.
[4:52:16] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You'll need to grind Fulminated Mercury
[4:52:29] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus So that original suggestion for returning to Double Ape burrow was correct, the Ring is there
[4:52:30] <$QueequegTheater> Yes
[4:52:30] <deviljhojho_> Call it big ape fire man guy to keep the mistery
[4:52:31] <@Solidus_113> Ashina Depths: Dropped from the Shichimen Warrior that spawns in the Guardian Ape's Burrow @WoolieVersus
[4:52:41] <+krispen_wa> Woolie still needs to get a Call Beyond to destroy Ebrietas easily
[4:52:43] <$QueequegTheater> @TheRealGreaterGamer He just wants to beat the game
[4:52:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Monkey Cave BEFORE fighting two monke
[4:52:47] <+RyanTheRecluse> where there were two
[4:52:47] <%Lion_kun> 2 monkeys cave
[4:52:48] <+SouLucha> Did Woolie hear the conversation between these two?
[4:52:53] <andre11dr> Man can we point how Wolf is just Guts with a katana?
[4:52:53] <+RyanTheRecluse> yes
[4:52:59] <%Lion_kun> double cave
[4:53:06] <+loukemia83> Poison Pool
[4:53:06] <deviljhojho_> thats just every from software progatonist
[4:53:07] <+krispen_wa> literally everyone in souls is a Guts analogue
[4:53:12] <%Lion_kun> past the swamp past the gun girl
[4:53:14] <$QueequegTheater> @TheRealGreaterGamer Who cares
[4:53:15] <+krispen_wa> ESPECIALLY the firekeeper
[4:53:16] <%Lion_kun> ashina depths
[4:53:18] <$QueequegTheater> It's just a name
[4:53:21] <linSP> between poison cave and spooky forest
[4:53:41] <shinichizio> Bustin' bustin'
[4:53:48] <deviljhojho_> bustin makes me feel good
[4:53:50] <$QueequegTheater> @TheRealGreaterGamer he already said he doesn't care
[4:54:08] <Blinge_Sadface> best grinding spot = bridge where red juzou is
[4:54:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/wooliewoolz/status/1372228846108483586?s=21
[4:54:10] <+legendfather_of_giants> you can
[4:54:19] <@Solidus_113> should be that guy
[4:54:23] <+legendfather_of_giants> he does @WoolieVersus
[4:54:25] <deviljhojho_> yeah
[4:54:35] <Johannen> That DA guy
[4:54:41] <%jinking79> hate these mini boss
[4:54:43] <%Lion_kun> get the malcontent ring
[4:54:45] <Ashenik1> yep its here
[4:54:46] <+krispen_wa> That Man
[4:54:51] <linSP> every ghost boss has useful unique items
[4:54:56] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @TheRealGreaterGamer
[4:54:59] <Johannen> @jinking79 Did ya ever Air Deathblow them?
[4:55:03] <%Lion_kun> he's easier than the one in fountainhead
[4:55:04] <$QueequegTheater> @jinking79 use antiair
[4:55:05] <deviljhojho_> if a ghost is kicking your ass isnt the best strategy to end thyself and then kick his ass when you are a ghost too?
[4:55:23] <andre11dr> Time to fight some ghost bullshit that game didn't make that much use of
[4:55:23] <%jepupu> That umbrella upgrade works really good against those
[4:55:27] <+krispen_wa> if a ghost kicks your ass, just revive it and kill it in your world
[4:55:30] <linSP> confetti: the biggest sin of sekiro
[4:55:32] <%jinking79> i did still annoying mini boss
[4:55:34] <deviljhojho_> ah big brain crikIQ
[4:55:42] <@Solidus_113> the power
[4:55:53] <shinichizio> The worst time I had with a ghost was the one time it teleported into a wall and did that ghost kamehameha to me anyway.
[4:56:07] <deviljhojho_> thats some good damage
[4:56:22] <deviljhojho_> thats not so good
[4:56:35] <+krispen_wa> are ghost peppers just dead peppers?
[4:56:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Anti Air deathblow him like a CHAD
[4:56:52] <+cubbywolf> Yoooo
[4:56:53] <deviljhojho_> yeah ghost peppers are peppers murdered by reaper peppers
[4:56:58] <deviljhojho_> its a symbiotic relationship
[4:57:00] <andre11dr> You'll need the Satan magatama to resist this hama spamming asshole
[4:57:05] <$QueequegTheater> boom
[4:57:09] <velgaduere> ezpz
[4:57:09] <deviljhojho_> sweet
[4:57:10] <+Awkward_Cyborg> yess
[4:57:12] <+krispen_wa> YOU DEFEATED
[4:57:13] <velgaduere> gg
[4:57:15] <Canadian_Suit> DAMN
[4:57:20] <+cubbywolf> is this metal gear? nah it sucks
[4:57:29] <wibbwobbler> oh nice
[4:57:33] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> Nice
[4:57:37] <$QueequegTheater> @cubbywolf so it's metal gear
[4:57:37] <deviljhojho_> foreshadowing tomatoPog
[4:57:40] <Ashenik1> hmmm
[4:57:49] <%Lion_kun> big rage hint
[4:57:52] <+cubbywolf> so... you've chosen Metal Gear.
[4:57:57] <andre11dr> @cubbywolf You mean like MGSV sucked
[4:58:00] <+krispen_wa> FIGHTING GAMES
[4:58:02] <deviljhojho_> i mean its no longer a raging demon but its still a demon
[4:58:09] <@Solidus_113> satsui no hadou's weakness
[4:58:16] <+cubbywolf> hey I like mgsv even though i never finished it because it was never finished
[4:58:18] <primaryfire> yeah that makes sense
[4:58:21] <Johannen> Yeah, cause that makes sense
[4:58:23] <Blank9> head empty no thoughts no sins
[4:58:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Rip Sculptors girlfriend
[4:58:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Or just be like Guy and block every hit
[4:58:29] <+Fenris_Alexius> It's more like if Akuma heard that, he'd go "AH! My head...it hurts...
[4:58:31] <penitentpendant> He just freezes in midair and the symbol on his back disappears
[4:58:32] <$QueequegTheater> That's not how sin works, Japan
[4:58:32] <huskarl_zap> AKuma never killed anyone
[4:58:33] <velgaduere> therapist: the Raging Demon can't hurt you, it isn't real
[4:58:33] <+cubbywolf> cubbywolf subscribed with Prime.
[4:58:41] <Jackomaning> Spiritual state of nothingess makes even fire itself cool
[4:58:43] <deviljhojho_> if you can no sell a secret tecnique by just emptying your mind then isnt better to just punch someone?
[4:58:46] <huskarl_zap> Sagat with a gun
[4:58:51] <%jinking79> Akuma Kill steak 1 until master wakes up
[4:58:55] <2deep5u> if you don't acknowledge your sins they literally stop existing, amazing lesson to learn
[4:59:00] <Blank9> you COULD empty your mind, but alternatively you could just jump
[4:59:02] <+luftraumm1> tha absolute bastardization of buddhism lol
[4:59:02] <$QueequegTheater> @huskarl_zap Just zigzag, he has no depth perception
[4:59:03] <Jackomaning> That was a deep cut reference I just made, damn
[4:59:04] <+krispen_wa> if gun is so good, why is there no gun 2
[4:59:11] <+cubbywolf> woolieONEGUY
[4:59:14] <Raldavar> Just be a vegetable and you too can beat Akuma
[4:59:16] <+cubbywolf> now I can be the one guy
[4:59:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> NO
[4:59:22] <+Fenris_Alexius> no
[4:59:25] <NDenizen> its trash
[4:59:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Absolutely not lol it sucks
[4:59:27] <shinichizio> It's big jokes
[4:59:29] <@Solidus_113> gun is a constant state of micro upgrading
[4:59:29] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its a shotgun spread
[4:59:34] <deviljhojho_> its fuckin shit but makes me laff
[4:59:38] <$QueequegTheater> I've literally never used it
[4:59:41] <Jackomaning> It's very strong if you like cap out money
[4:59:43] <+cubbywolf> imagine switching tools in battle
[4:59:47] <deviljhojho_> Gun 3: You are the gun
[4:59:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just get Fire fan and whistle
[4:59:55] <wibbwobbler> money is good against posture
[4:59:57] <velgaduere> @krispen_wa bro there was so many sequels to Gun, the GCU just sucks
[4:59:58] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You might want to get the fire shield next
[4:59:58] <andre11dr> Always gun
[5:00:03] <andre11dr> GUN IT UP
[5:00:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It works against spirits now
[5:00:08] <Blank9> fire umbrella's the only other great one
[5:00:17] <+OblivionSword1> it's for ghost
[5:00:17] <NDenizen> fire umbrella
[5:00:18] <deviljhojho_> so what are the tools to use in sekiro anyways? Umbrella and axe?
[5:00:19] <@Solidus_113> nothing else to do before fighting the dragon?
[5:00:22] <penitentpendant> Ghosts go "Ah... my head..."
[5:00:23] <%Lion_kun> didn't know malcontent worked on ghosts
[5:00:36] <andre11dr> Imagine if Wolf just carried a SMG around
[5:00:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Fire Umbrella is the best for reasons.
[5:00:47] <%jepupu> Umbrella makes you pretty immune to ghost attacks
[5:00:51] <$QueequegTheater> Fire
[5:00:56] <penitentpendant> @andre11dr Let's be honest, it'd a be a Sniper Rifle if anything
[5:00:58] <deviljhojho_> you have to use confetti for every bullet which is inconvenient
[5:01:26] <Ashenik1> fire umbrella is super usefull
[5:01:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:01:31] <$QueequegTheater> Sekiro 2: Gun
[5:01:42] <NDenizen> Fire Umbrella > Any final upgrade
[5:01:47] <Blank9> ^
[5:01:50] <Johannen> ^
[5:01:50] <andre11dr> @penitentpendant It took my way to long to get that LUL
[5:01:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus I didnt get all the upgrades until NG+
[5:01:55] <%Lion_kun> uoi can't get them all in one playthrough
[5:02:01] <%Lion_kun> you can get two
[5:02:03] <primaryfire> not being very subtle here lads
[5:02:04] <jorniev> sekiro 2 other weapons besides sword
[5:02:07] <penitentpendant> @andre11dr It's not a recent game, by any means
[5:02:10] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You can only get two of the final tier in NG
[5:02:27] <%Lion_kun> you can get 2
[5:02:32] <Ashenik1> sekiro 2: taming the dragon of China during imperialistic era
[5:02:38] <linSP> not enough lazuli in one NG to get all final upgrades anyways
[5:02:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Enemies in the Ashina Castle Siege should drop enough Mercury
[5:02:43] <+Zanzibar_Junker> shurikens were what I chose
[5:02:48] <%Lion_kun> enough lazuli for 2
[5:02:49] <$QueequegTheater> 6
[5:02:50] <jorniev> sekiro 2: 2 prostetic arms
[5:02:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You can farm mercury from that one dude at the gun fort
[5:03:01] <andre11dr> I actually played Twin Snakes before the original so Twin Snakes IS mgs1 to me
[5:03:02] <Psyramics> there are not enough to get everything
[5:03:23] <%Lion_kun> you have to beat the optional superboss to get the final lazuli
[5:03:37] <$SilverRoddo> Roku desu
[5:03:38] <@Solidus_113> Axe breaks guard real nice
[5:03:40] <primaryfire> completely up to you
[5:03:42] <$QueequegTheater> BURN IN HOLY FIRE
[5:03:42] <deviljhojho_> do as you will chosen one
[5:03:50] <jorniev> axe is an overhead with knockdown right?
[5:03:54] <Hydrapissed> dont hold BAK
[5:03:55] <Ashenik1> no final boss today :<
[5:03:58] <@Solidus_113> go all out, just this once
[5:04:04] <deviljhojho_> master forgive me
[5:04:09] <%Lion_kun> demon of hatred will probably take a stream by himself
[5:04:14] <jorniev> REMOVE THE LIMITERS
[5:04:14] <Raldavar> Axe does lots of posture damage
[5:04:15] <Pandora_Prime> Shuriken is a ranged chainsaw
[5:04:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Try out the whistle, i think it has a unique sound
[5:04:20] <andre11dr> !uptime
[5:04:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 24 minutes
[5:04:23] <penitentpendant> Been playing P4G recently, so 'all out' keeps switching to 'all out attack' in my mind
[5:04:26] <deviljhojho_> 6 hours of devil of miffedness
[5:04:32] <deviljhojho_> its gonna be great
[5:04:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Quick go kill the badass dragon!
[5:04:39] <andre11dr> Wow we went long today
[5:04:43] <plaguedoctor_syan> The only thing about the "blue" upgrades is because they hurt ghost and such so they are no so worth it in my opininion
[5:04:44] <%Lion_kun> yes
[5:04:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Yes
[5:04:47] <$QueequegTheater> Yes
[5:04:50] <Ashenik1> yep
[5:04:55] <%Lion_kun> woolie got everything for all endings
[5:04:56] <primaryfire> only ashina castle idols re-lock
[5:05:06] <%Lion_kun> superboss you can do
[5:05:10] <@Solidus_113> the super boss is after the dragon
[5:05:12] <deviljhojho_> he is a bitch bro you can kick his ass
[5:05:16] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The golden fan should be the next goal if you want to farm
[5:05:18] <+b_aleph> YOU WILL DO HIM!
[5:05:21] <Blank9> you're good to go
[5:05:21] <%Lion_kun> you are fine now
[5:05:24] <%jinking79> easy to meet him or beat him
[5:05:28] <Ashenik1> you are fine
[5:05:31] <%Lion_kun> fight the super boss woolie
[5:05:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The only material I ever needed to farm was Mercury from the Gun fort
[5:05:36] <primaryfire> he shares the same arena as a previous boss
[5:05:36] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The fire shield hard counters the optional superboss
[5:05:49] <smuggleruncle> super boss is def easier than last boss
[5:05:51] <deviljhojho_> Perhaps
[5:05:54] <$QueequegTheater> Back up just in case
[5:05:55] <NDenizen> no
[5:05:55] <%Lion_kun> better safe than sorry
[5:05:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You dont need to but sure
[5:05:57] <+Jiggisnipe> sure
[5:05:57] <$SilverRoddo> Fear is the mind goblin killer? ü§î
[5:05:58] <Ashenik1> why the heck not
[5:06:02] <penitentpendant> Woolie Brain on point
[5:06:02] <+Jiggisnipe> doesn't hurt to do it lol
[5:06:03] <NDenizen> you've done anything that matters tbh
[5:06:04] <+SouLucha> I DID
[5:06:04] <+legendfather_of_giants> no. there is NOTHING locked out here you didn't already do
[5:06:06] <+OblivionSword1> better be safe than sorry
[5:06:10] <$QueequegTheater> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[5:06:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> you have everything, but why not
[5:06:12] <wibbwobbler> woolieT
[5:06:13] <%jinking79> all this progress yes
[5:06:15] <velgaduere> yeh might as well
[5:06:18] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[5:06:18] <zocano> super boss is still tricky and not easy but final boss is by far the hardest fight
[5:06:23] <jorniev> I FORGOT ACTIVITION MADE THIS
[5:06:23] <Ashenik1> paper ?

[5:06:34] <@Solidus_113> @jorniev published
[5:06:41] <primaryfire> *Something something*
[5:06:45] <penitentpendant> We're not sayin' much anyway
[5:06:49] <Blinge_Sadface> man i found superboss way harder than final
[5:06:55] <$QueequegTheater> @zocano no way, DoH is way harder because it wasn't designed for Sekiro, it's a Bloodborne boss awkwardly shoved into Sekiro
[5:06:57] <andre11dr> it's midnight for me if that helps you LUL
[5:07:07] <Raldavar> Forgot your phone? That's 10 times worse than losing a child!
[5:07:21] <skyentombment> man, I tabbed out a while ago for work, Woolie looks defeated
[5:07:26] <Blinge_Sadface> @QueequegTheater too real.
[5:07:28] <skyentombment> yes
[5:07:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Quick woolie beat the final boss too while you're ay ot
[5:07:37] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> Yes
[5:07:55] <Ashenik1> @Blinge_Sadface I find them both chalenging as fuck but final boss is way much more enjoyable to play
[5:08:03] <Blinge_Sadface> yep yep
[5:08:06] <skyentombment> Today was sure one of dem days in the influence mines
[5:08:12] <$QueequegTheater> Stream tax is real
[5:08:22] <+vaporousTippler> It's so much harder than you'd think.
[5:08:24] <andre11dr> DoH is not thst green, kinda of a wierd fight
[5:08:35] <jorniev> always should commend woolie for his hard work
[5:08:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:08:41] <penitentpendant> Gotta concentrate
[5:08:51] <Blinge_Sadface> only way I beat DoH was sprinting around like Nascar constantly and coming back in to hump his left leg
[5:09:02] <+cubbywolf> woolieGIRLS woolieACCIDENT woolieYE woolieGLORY woolieFUN woolieCHAN woolieGASM
[5:09:25] <$QueequegTheater> Oh wait, I probably should have used the malcontent to fight the Headless, huh?
[5:09:26] <$QueequegTheater> Whoops
[5:09:27] <%Lion_kun> Frog Ninja
[5:09:28] <andre11dr> Man i wish i had the experience Woolie had with Fume, i just one shot him with magic the first time
[5:09:35] <+cubbywolf> are there enough humans to entertain you in nioh 2?
[5:09:42] <Ashenik1> Frog fight was the best!!!
[5:09:46] <UnfilteredComic> Frog threw me for a loop

[5:13:21] <+legendfather_of_giants> it IS still a boss
[5:13:22] <ferbeholds> COUNTER
[5:13:22] <Blank9> it's the best giant boss fight in a souls-ish game
[5:13:27] <+cubbywolf> cant you parry it?
[5:13:30] <UnfilteredComic> Yeah lets definetley cut that
[5:13:32] <+cubbywolf> i forget
[5:13:33] <%Lion_kun> that cockyness
[5:13:35] <$QueequegTheater> Nothing wastes more time than trying to save time
[5:13:38] <$TheFabledAble> nothing wastes time like trying to save time
[5:13:40] <$TheFabledAble> LOL
[5:13:41] <%WutangchickeN> hey chat is this the end of the game? This feels final bossy
[5:13:41] <T_Sasquatch> Yikessssssssss
[5:13:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean that would have been cool if you parried that
[5:13:45] <Johannen> @cubbywolf Parry? What you think this is? Some Sekiro?
[5:13:46] <%justcallmebobplease> You know I never questioned this before, but does the Divine Dragon having just the one arm have anything to do with other less-than-fully-limbed entities?
[5:13:47] <+Jiggisnipe> chat gets it
[5:13:51] <UnfilteredComic> @WutangchickeN no much more to do
[5:13:54] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WutangchickeN no, start of final act
[5:13:55] <andre11dr> @blank9 Eh Storm King will always be number 1 to me
[5:13:56] <skyentombment> "Edit all that out" - Super Eyepatch Wolf
[5:14:00] <%WutangchickeN> shit thanks guys
[5:14:00] <Jackomaning> @WutangchickeN This leads into the final act
[5:14:03] <Raldavar> No respect for the urgon
[5:14:05] <+cubbywolf> @Johannen no way i only play dark souls
[5:14:09] <Deasmeister> Why is the old dragon bit even here?
[5:14:12] <$TheFabledAble> @WutangchickeN nope theres an ENTIRE section after this with 2 more bosses and tons of mini bosses
[5:14:18] <$QueequegTheater> @justcallmebobplease I assumed it was a reflection of Wolf's mental image of himself
[5:14:20] <%WutangchickeN> cool stuff
[5:14:25] <+cubbywolf> because we need dragon tears?
[5:14:51] <Deasmeister> No just the first phase its a weird phase
[5:15:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @justcallmebobplease Its the branch Takeru stole
[5:15:02] <%justcallmebobplease> @QueequegTheater Yeah, I suppose that makes sense - the loreslut in me just wants it to be related to Mr. big, red, and angry, or something.
[5:15:12] <+zaworldo> does anybody know what the FUCK is happening here?

[5:21:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Good job beating Owl. So proud to see you finally click with the combat! :D
[5:21:36] <+OblivionSword1> well at least 2 more sessions maybe
[5:21:38] <+penjaza> I doubt it will finish next session, unless you go super long
[5:21:41] <+legendfather_of_giants> depends on superboss, didn't take TOO long for Pat
[5:21:43] <andre11dr> Whens Disco out?
[5:21:44] <+cubbywolf> never stop the content
[5:21:49] <velgaduere> that's okay, the Monster Hunter Rise LP will start right on time Keepo
[5:21:50] <primaryfire> march 30th @andre11dr
[5:21:51] <Blank9> if you beat owl, then sure, 5-6 hours might do it for all endings
[5:21:52] <%Mathochism> Disco is the 30th.
[5:21:53] <penitentpendant> Oh the Disco Tease
[5:21:54] <andre11dr> Ok
[5:21:55] <$QueequegTheater> He might not even bother with the superboss
[5:21:55] <Johannen> @andre11dr 30th
[5:21:59] <linSP> disco elysium yeyeye
[5:22:11] <jorniev> ILL FINISH IT BEFORE WATCHING your stream
[5:22:14] <+penjaza> And optional big boss
[5:22:15] <%Lion_kun> Are you gonna attempt the shura boss?
[5:22:17] <+b_aleph> Sword saint should take at least 4 hours
[5:22:25] <samuelfisk> And the super boss
[5:22:27] <+penjaza> He's cool
[5:22:28] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus What about the Shura ending boss fight?
[5:22:31] <primaryfire> that's fine too
[5:22:36] <fangovafang> Yall shud check out "Sinner:Sacrifice for Redemption"

[5:22:48] <velgaduere> @b_aleph nice one brp
[5:22:51] <velgaduere> bro too
[5:22:59] <Jashter18> Hey whoever that said that SHUSH
[5:23:21] <primaryfire> darklurker is the only fromsoft boss I haven't fought lol
[5:23:22] <andre11dr> I got like a quarter threw Disco so im hyped to get back and actually to finish it
[5:23:22] <+b_aleph> Why are you booing me? I'm right!
[5:23:30] <Matt_Cowdery> I remember the LP of fume knight and feeling validated for how hard it was for me
[5:23:31] <$QueequegTheater> Fume Knight just fucked you for an entire session
[5:23:32] <linSP> Maria is good
[5:23:38] <velgaduere> @b_aleph please double down harder, it fuels us
[5:23:43] <@Solidus_113> Alonne was harder than Fume imo
[5:23:44] <Ashenik1> Maybe becasue it was the first I guess
[5:23:46] <+Fenris_Alexius> You never forget the first time you smash your dick against a wall
[5:23:53] <primaryfire> fume's timing was fucked up
[5:23:54] <andre11dr> Fume night is not that much for me for reasons i explained
[5:23:58] <Karhax> the Alonne run to the fight was harder
[5:24:06] <%Wool> Reggie did it
[5:24:21] <+loukemia83> Is there going to be one more LaD stream?
[5:24:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Good job Woolie. With how much you've improved I'm sure the next stream wont take more than 8 hours! :D LUL
[5:24:46] <rosemon5001> will we ever get minh whit his hair down?
[5:25:02] <+Jiggisnipe> @loukemia83 probably one more session to get the 13 hours
[5:25:09] <@Solidus_113> GOTY 2019
[5:25:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair
[5:25:11] <+cubbywolf> what about the old lady?
[5:25:13] <andre11dr> Like Fume is cool but doesn't stand a chance compared to the best DS1 and DS3 bosses
[5:25:22] <velgaduere> that's fine, it's meh and forgettable
[5:25:39] <$QueequegTheater> @andre11dr nah
[5:25:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus I unironically shed a tear fighting Owl. So fucking beautiful!
[5:25:42] <+RyanTheRecluse> I'm hoping the mini-series before Disco Elysium is what I think it is but with Woolie it could be anything

[5:26:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What lows?
[5:26:11] <$QueequegTheater> @legendfather_of_giants I'm not
[5:26:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[5:26:16] <$QueequegTheater> KappaHD
[5:26:32] <+cubbywolf> the 2nd playthrough is like a speed run. It's hard to not go fast
[5:26:34] <%Lion_kun> I think Sekiro has the msot refined comabt in the series.
[5:26:44] <skyentombment> @QueequegTheater Behold, the wrongest man this side of the atlantic!
[5:26:46] <+cubbywolf> also hard to complete
[5:26:48] <%Lion_kun> I think Sekiro has the most refined combat in the series.
[5:26:50] <+cubbywolf> because you get bored
[5:26:54] <andre11dr> @queequegtheater I don't care to fight anyone, i think all games have highs and lows and DS2 definitely has some highs
[5:26:58] <+legendfather_of_giants> @Lion_kun because it does
[5:27:01] <%Lion_kun> boooooooo
[5:27:05] <%Lion_kun> Snyder Cut
[5:27:07] <$QueequegTheater> Sucker Punch is so frustrating
[5:27:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You say that but you finally played it perfectly with that owl fight! :D
[5:27:19] <penitentpendant> Dark Souls Snyder Cut, what would even change?
[5:27:29] <$QueequegTheater> Snyder is good at visuals, but goddamn he just can NOT write human dialogue
[5:27:39] <$SilverRoddo> SuckerpunchHype RPGEmpty
[5:27:40] <%jinking79> more slow motion
[5:27:42] <DomonTrigger> Snyder of the First Sin
[5:27:42] <OldManDeckardCain> minh did like 3rd birthday LUL
[5:27:49] <andre11dr> Snyder is just a music video man
[5:27:52] <skyentombment> @QueequegTheater And even in the visuals, I'd argue it's ehhhh
[5:27:57] <%doctordinkus> suckerpunch is an exact 6/10
[5:28:02] <+luftraumm1> sucker punch is absolute trash
[5:28:07] <$QueequegTheater> @skyentombment fair, it's very much my jam though
[5:28:15] <%Lion_kun> replay the boss fights
[5:28:22] <@Solidus_113> you have the boss rush menu now, that's all you need
[5:28:24] <+cubbywolf> idk the learning part is fine
[5:28:24] <+b_aleph> It's great! I'm never touching it again!
[5:28:26] <+luftraumm1> the video gamey stuff is so cringe
[5:28:30] <%Lion_kun> YOU CAN
[5:28:31] <wibbwobbler> did not like sucker punch at all lmao
[5:28:34] <primaryfire> I've handed a friend a save before so he can do the boss rushes
[5:28:35] <Deasmeister> Boss rush unlocked haha
[5:28:38] <+cubbywolf> I think its been so long since woolie played the begining he has a wierd view on it
[5:28:42] <penitentpendant> That's the major thing about Sekiro compared to all other souls games, you don't want to replay it as much
[5:28:46] <+spunkmire2> Snyder's wife is also a Warner exec. Explains a lot.
[5:28:52] <+RyTYoung> Sucker Punch was...a film?
[5:28:52] <Johannen> Not everybody has the Hard Ons for Boss Rush and Fighting game stuff
[5:29:02] <+legendfather_of_giants> beating the game unlocks Boss Rush gauntlets for outfits @WoolieVersus
[5:29:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus My point was that you finally didn't suck lol You got over the bad jumping habit and were very aggressive. It was H Y P E
[5:29:30] <+RyTYoung> Hey you forgot Lords of the Fallen Woolie wtf LUL
[5:29:32] <$QueequegTheater> Those people are wrong and dumb >:(
[5:29:42] <Matt_Cowdery> DS2 was a great game for sure
[5:29:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:29:56] <@Solidus_113> DS2 has some great stuff that still infuriates me, replaying SOTFS very recently
[5:30:07] <%Lion_kun> I really like monkey valley
[5:30:07] <+Jiggisnipe> but it does have alot tho
[5:30:12] <Johannen> Going thru Tower of Heide...you mean the walkway to the tower and 3 platforms...lol that area is a joke
[5:30:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Hot Take: Souls Games Are Good
[5:30:14] <%CptnCampy61> DS2 is good. The DLC is great
[5:30:26] <DatAsuna> Ambivalence
[5:30:31] <+b_aleph> Like an abusive girlfriend
[5:30:31] <penitentpendant> That 'comedy/tragedy' mask analgoy
[5:30:34] <velgaduere> pure ambivalence
[5:30:34] <andre11dr> Hei man I think DS3 is better than DS1 so don't look at me for the good Souls take
[5:30:36] <+RyTYoung> It made me bummed out knowing I had missed out on boss fights since I had messed up the best ending
[5:30:37] <+cubbywolf> Rock on
[5:30:41] <penitentpendant> Game Over YEAH
[5:30:41] <@Commando_Joe> ciao
[5:30:42] <ExpressNode> Wow I came back at the end
[5:30:42] <+cubbywolf> woolieVS
