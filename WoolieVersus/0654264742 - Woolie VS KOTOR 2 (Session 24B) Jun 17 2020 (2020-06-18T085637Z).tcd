[0:11:57] <%Gruhunchously> WHo even knows where these things came from.
[0:11:58] <Halospaz117> I think this planet would be better dead, honestly
[0:11:58] <tranquilturnip> does this count as "living"
[0:12:05] <+RowenCleric> these super beasts have made this their castle
[0:12:07] <%jillpilled> it's a living!
[0:12:29] <%Gruhunchously> Life...eh, finds a way
[0:12:40] <andrei11dr> It's impressive that Malakor V even has a hospitable atmosphere after they Gravity Nuked it

[0:13:08] <+charmquarke> The only time that that's accurate is in SMT
[0:13:09] <ashenjuan25> Consume even if you must die
[0:13:12] <%alrobot2014> but in this case i did need it later
[0:13:18] <phatmac16> Whey are these monsters?
[0:13:22] <%DatAsuna> Use those energy shields while you need em
[0:13:24] <%Gruhunchously> Welcome to planet HELL
[0:13:36] <DedlokPM> They look like monsters to you?
[0:13:38] <LunarRemix> Best thing SMT has ever did was putting a cap on how many of a specific item you could carry
[0:13:42] <+Feralspirit41> Can you tell theres a boss here?
[0:13:43] <ashenjuan25> They look like the real ghouls inbred cousin
[0:13:50] <ashenjuan25> Rakghouls
[0:14:24] <akman14> The starforge is literally a starlifter , it's a thing that can theoretically be made
[0:14:34] <+Will9099> yes space 3d printer go brrr

[0:14:36] <%krispen_wa> FORCE GAS
[0:14:42] <+PAUSEBREAKreviews> force brap
[0:14:49] <ATPsoldat> Starforge could theoretically be used for good, as oppose to the Death Star

[0:14:58] <+kapcommunist> is that one of those bladeless fans? amazing
[0:14:59] <%VCRUZZO> easy
[0:15:05] <%DatAsuna> There's 2 actual dyson spheres in swtor.
[0:15:12] <+Feralspirit41> Are there
[0:15:16] <rubbishbinge> conservation of matter is just a concept created by the jedi
[0:15:20] <+Feralspirit41> I dont remember there being any
[0:15:21] <andrei11dr> I mean, i always assumed that most Star Wars technology was just 3d printed
[0:15:22] <%lotharrio> I'm still annoyed that like... 4 or 5 years ago, we thought we detected a dyson sphere.
[0:15:23] <available_line> Can it actually be made, theoretically? I'm thinking about the materials. A star is VERY hot. I think anything space station near it would melt.
[0:15:24] <%Gruhunchously> Oh look who it is
[0:15:32] <%DatAsuna> Well 1 of the swtor ones is a dyson bubble, the sun razor
[0:15:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Everything is hydrogen
[0:15:42] <%DatAsuna> The other is a full shell around the star, Iokath
[0:15:46] <AntifaCatboy> her?
[0:15:55] <AntifaCatboy> Oh Mira
[0:15:58] <+Feralspirit41> I totally forgot about iokath
[0:15:59] <%Space_Pagan> Who?
[0:16:00] <+evbites> egg?
[0:16:05] <damienlunas> Seatbelts
[0:16:08] <memejima> Nobody wears seatbelts in star wars
[0:16:09] <tranquilturnip> speak up
[0:16:11] <%alpacasintophats> now for Mira has to go do the predictable thing
[0:16:13] <+jiggy_snipe> how

[0:16:29] <BurdRightsActivist> Angry wookie sounds
[0:16:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ITS CHEWBACCA WOW
[0:16:34] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus If you recruited hanharr, he has 0 malachor scenes
[0:16:35] <+evbites> let her go
[0:16:35] <+logoth_> Why was the wookie doing the Guile eye bulge
[0:16:39] <Halospaz117> Man, he was clinging to the outside of the shit for a long time, huh?
[0:16:39] <%brachydios777> Oh

[0:16:58] <phatmac16> HMMMMMM
[0:17:01] <%DatAsuna> @Feralspirit41 lowkey I kinda hate iokath lorewise but it's visually cool
[0:17:05] <shutupandjam3465> GEE WOOLIE IDK
[0:17:05] <Halospaz117> Oh yeah, killing all the beasts is a REALLY good idea
[0:17:09] <+cowardman93> I feel like he should be having a complete mental breakdown and about to swallow a gun
[0:17:10] <shutupandjam3465> THAT WOULD BE COOL THO
[0:17:11] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:17:26] <+evbites> it's like Oppenheimer going to the crater
[0:17:30] <+RICE02> Chewie we` re home
[0:17:35] <+Feralspirit41> @datasuna its visually cool dor sure but I hated all of the eternal empire stuff, lack of real chouces like the rest of the game and a stupid storyline
[0:17:44] <huskarl_zap> Woolie the stars have the force flowing through them they live and die out.
[0:17:46] <+AsinPersuasion> what triggers the moobot thing about the mods
[0:17:50] <GHouseduivel> What?
[0:17:52] <+serpenttucker> WHAAAAAAAT
[0:17:52] <+jiggy_snipe> WHAT?
[0:17:53] <%lotharrio> Who would ever say that?!
[0:17:53] <%Space_Pagan> noooo way
[0:17:53] <%jillpilled> realllly?
[0:17:53] <%alpharius88> whaaat?
[0:17:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> NANI
[0:17:58] <DedlokPM> NANI?
[0:18:00] <%krispen_wa> IMPOSSIBLE
[0:18:01] <phatmac16> NOOOO
[0:18:04] <zaitje> no vey?
[0:18:04] <%DatAsuna> @Feralspirit41 Personally I really loved the POTENTIAL of Vaylin, but yeah they fucked it up by the end
[0:18:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ZORO?
[0:18:06] <Daskolin> So you literally Rareno Zorro?
[0:18:11] <ashenjuan25> Hall wugging
[0:18:17] <Prevot> the WORST thing you can have is one of those Skyrim compass things
[0:18:20] <Halospaz117> FREEDON
[0:18:20] <ATPsoldat> I can the sarcasm physically manifesting from chat
[0:18:21] <%Space_Pagan> THE NADDS
[0:18:22] <tranquilturnip> He's HERE Pog
[0:18:22] <%VCRUZZO> WOW
[0:18:25] <$Invlux> ANOTHA ONE
[0:18:25] <%jillpilled> NADDS EVERYWHERE
[0:18:26] <memejima> Dude this guy had SO many Blasters
[0:18:27] <time_axis> Kreia probably put that there as a joke
[0:18:28] <ZeeJiggle> Freedon Nadd Everywhere
[0:18:32] <%Gruhunchously> Freedon Nadd was at Malachor V confirmed
[0:18:33] <shutupandjam3465> ow many of these fucking thigns are there?
[0:18:33] <Halospaz117> HIS POCKETS ARE SO LOOSE
[0:18:33] <GHouseduivel> Maybe Nadd had more than 1 set of arms
[0:18:36] <damienlunas> Freedon Nadd is like Reaper, he just throws his guns away instead of reloading
[0:18:36] <ashenjuan25> Free dem nads
[0:18:36] <%VCRUZZO> this is so the wrong playthrough
[0:18:37] <+MillerLowlife> The nadds on this Freedon
[0:18:37] <+Feralspirit41> @datasuna vaylin wouldve made a great sith lord but they shouldve just not made it at all
[0:18:38] <%DatAsuna> @Feralspirit41 Also if the budget had held up, it woulda been cool to build the alliance and just keep doing loyalty missions
[0:18:39] <%krispen_wa> THE FREEDON NADD SYSTEM
[0:18:48] <ashenjuan25> I’m sorry I’m so sorry but free dem nadds
[0:18:52] <%VCRUZZO> shouda went gun sith
[0:18:53] <@Commando_Joe> if you don't have the map you miss out on the SECRETSSSSSSS octoSad
[0:18:55] <%Space_Pagan> The Nadds in our Stars
[0:18:58] <memejima> It was actually his second cousin, keegan Nadd
[0:19:01] <%krispen_wa> the only good thing about KOTET and KOTFE was killing Kaliyo
[0:19:14] <%DatAsuna> And playing sabaac with gault
[0:19:19] <%Gruhunchously> Oh hey it's a ship, EMBEDDED in the planet's surface.
[0:19:20] <BurdRightsActivist> Little "I like being confused" V
[0:19:24] <%DatAsuna> Also Hylo coming back
[0:19:24] <Halospaz117> God I love how all of these ships are crashed INTO the planet
[0:19:28] <+Feralspirit41> @datasuna it wouldve been good if they just let you make the choices you want but instead no matter what class you are its just "im the commander of this new alliance"
[0:19:38] <+Exicuren> Freedon Nadd really got around
[0:19:40] <GHouseduivel> Oh Christ
[0:19:41] <Prince_Robot> morrowind next
[0:19:46] <%krispen_wa> MORROWIND DIRECTIONS
[0:19:47] <Camail> ok but some of that sucked
[0:19:48] <+AsinPersuasion> except the game lied to you
[0:19:50] <%krispen_wa> Oh god
[0:19:56] <%DSD24> I love Morrowind
[0:19:59] <huskarl_zap> Gothic next
[0:19:59] <ashenjuan25> Best example is rdr2 of v’s problem for me it’s beautiful to look at but I’m focused on the waypoint the whole time
[0:19:59] <%R3Roundabout> People love fetishizing that shit
[0:19:59] <Halospaz117> That would kill Woolie
[0:20:02] <Prevot> sounds awful
[0:20:02] <StarlitStunner> Dagoth Wave
[0:20:03] <Daxalog> I IMMEDIATLY got lost.
[0:20:06] <Daskolin> <3 morrowind
[0:20:06] <agrippaarpeggio> I remember how I had to look for some cave for like 5 hours
[0:20:07] <+jiggy_snipe> I do like when games do that properly
[0:20:07] <%jillpilled> Also you flew across the map LUL
[0:20:07] <GHouseduivel> There are 0 quest markers for that game
[0:20:13] <phatmac16> no thanks
[0:20:18] <%jillpilled> That shit has aged like curdled milk
[0:20:19] <+cowardman93> I like it as a concept but in practice it would ruin me
[0:20:21] <SereneFox> Yeah, I couldn't find anything at all in that game, I didn't get very far at all
[0:20:26] <Halospaz117> I kinda had the same thing with GTA San Andreas, the lack of GPS made me memorize the map more
[0:20:29] <%Theycallmenerf> I never played any Elderscroll games. I’m guessing they’re worth it chat?
[0:20:29] <time_axis> and then there's Skyrim, cross every mountain in a straight line toward the objective
[0:20:34] <Doodle_Taco> Witcher does that good
[0:20:38] <%krispen_wa> Man, fuck that Redoran quest where the dude gives INACCURATE directions
[0:20:41] <+Feralspirit41> @datasuna there was also that super stupid mission that they basically just ripped off of empire strikes back and how they made the player force sensative no matter what
[0:20:44] <+charmquarke> I like a way point system where you have to put down your own way points
[0:20:52] <StarlitStunner> Just bounce across the Morrowind map with Super Jump and levitation spells
[0:20:53] <agrippaarpeggio> oh no, Witcher doesn't do that good
[0:20:56] <+jiggy_snipe> yea tho I got used to GTA4's map even with the gps
[0:21:00] <time_axis> BotW's sidequests were like that, and I liked them
[0:21:04] <+krabsan> i really tried to get into Morrowind but im not really into not having waypoint
[0:21:05] <phatmac16> Zelda’s map system in BOTW was neat
[0:21:06] <hassanico2> I just arrived is chat talking SWotOR?
[0:21:06] <+cowardman93> I'd like that kind of system on a smaller scale
[0:21:16] <available_line> Morrowind was my first AAA RPG. I remember the graphics were so good by those standards, I was amazed when I was reading about it in a gaming magazine.
[0:21:26] <agrippaarpeggio> Witcher isn't written with no questmarkers in mind
[0:21:29] <AntifaCatboy> Does force enlightenment still work if you don't have force speed, valor or armour?
[0:21:31] <+Exicuren> I like map on, mind goblings tell me to discover the map
[0:21:32] <%DatAsuna> @Feralspirit41 Yeah visions in the dark ain't great.
[0:21:33] <memejima> A map like Hollow Knight is good too where it gives u some of the map from exploring then you fill it out as you go
[0:21:42] <+AsinPersuasion> yes but it onlu applies the ones you have
[0:21:43] <%Ashenik1> Souls like are great at it!
[0:21:48] <hassanico2> what's up with the dino men
[0:21:49] <+AsinPersuasion> if you dont have any then no
[0:21:50] <ashenjuan25> A legit compass would be cool
[0:21:54] <VJdarkworld> i absolutely hate minimaps, distracts me way too much
[0:21:54] <phatmac16> Souls games do this
[0:21:57] <%alrobot2014> goddamn namco
[0:22:02] <%GiantPapaDoug> i think it kinda depends on the game for me
[0:22:07] <+Feralspirit41> @datasuna they also stressed being middle of the road, like no. Im sticking to the path ive been on the whole game
[0:22:09] <%DatAsuna> patent i think
[0:22:11] <Doodle_Taco> Dammit Namco
[0:22:13] <%krispen_wa> Visions in the Dark was a really dumb ripoff of KOTOR II
[0:22:15] <%VCRUZZO> I remeber that
[0:22:16] <+evbites> nemesis system
[0:22:18] <andrei11dr> Wow, i forgot how dumb the monsters look here LUL
[0:22:18] <IvesNapalm> Morrowind was great, you had to use the information given to you to do the quests. No marker telling you to go here next which took away from the exploration.
[0:22:20] <hassanico2> Great if you bought a DBZ game, sucks if anything else had loading games
[0:22:21] <%GiantPapaDoug> like metroidvanias and first person rpg's i tend to prefer not having mini maps
[0:22:26] <hassanico2> And now there are no more loading screens
[0:22:30] <+krabsan> man dbz budokai tenkaichi had awesome loading screen games
[0:22:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @serpenttucker
[0:22:33] <SereneFox> I like to at least know which direction I need to be going, I don't need a full on "go to this exact point" just a "yeah you going the right general direction"
[0:22:43] <+serpenttucker> Give me active reload in every game please
[0:22:44] <available_line> You could also create spells in Morrowind.
[0:22:46] <rubbishbinge> gotta get those demon fangs in okami some how
[0:22:50] <derap41> Yeah that was they had the 3D arrow on llock
[0:22:56] <ashenjuan25> Compass works for me with a well thought out road system
[0:23:05] <hassanico2> Capcom patented the MMBN battle system! They used it to take down a fangame last year...
[0:23:06] <%GiantPapaDoug> the spell crafter in morrowind and oblivion was hella busted though lmao
[0:23:13] <%DatAsuna> @Feralspirit41 my AU headcanon ending is that KotET instead ends with Satele severing Vaylin from the force.and forcing her to live powerless
[0:23:14] <memejima> Oh so she FELL out
[0:23:16] <%Gruhunchously> And she fell like 50 feet
[0:23:16] <+jiggy_snipe> damn she got thrown
[0:23:17] <%GiantPapaDoug> still love those games though
[0:23:29] <+Exicuren> Sega is the specific arrow on the top indicating your direction
[0:23:29] <%krispen_wa> DON'T THINK ABOUT IT
[0:23:30] <+AsinPersuasion> the force tho
[0:23:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> force tho
[0:23:32] <+cowardman93> force though
[0:23:33] <time_axis> armor also
[0:23:37] <%Gruhunchously> Exo-suit
[0:23:38] <Halospaz117> She landed on the mask, it's fine
[0:23:39] <%Space_Pagan> Plot Armor
[0:23:40] <+evbites> gravity is different
[0:23:41] <IvesNapalm> Well Skyrim they went from broken custom spells to broken weapon and armor upgrades
[0:23:42] <%DatAsuna> Adept
[0:23:43] <%Gruhunchously> Jeedai
[0:23:43] <+jiggy_snipe> bounty hunter powers Kappa
[0:23:44] <StarlitStunner> Tumbled down the hill
[0:23:46] <phatmac16> Plot armor
[0:23:49] <hassanico2> forceplotarmor
[0:23:51] <+Feralspirit41> @datasuna thatd be so much better especially if they left her in a prison as well
[0:23:56] <Halospaz117> @evbites Honestly, wouldn't Gravity here be STRONGER?
[0:24:06] <+logoth_> Waypoints are often used to cover up creppy level design

[0:24:27] <agrippaarpeggio> Morrowing alchemy/spellcraft was broken, but at least it was super fun and fitting for the setting
[0:24:29] <%GiantPapaDoug> skyrim's problem lies entirely in the smithing tree. you can make custom armors and weapons better than any legendary item like a daedric artifact
[0:24:34] <ZeeJiggle> DONT LOOK TOO CLOSE

[0:25:08] <+krabsan> man hanharr is so much cooler than this girl
[0:25:08] <%krispen_wa> DRUUUGS
[0:25:09] <time_axis> you could save the level for a heal
[0:25:09] <%psidefx> Classic song
[0:25:11] <ShiningAxis> should have saved the level for health
[0:25:14] <ashenjuan25> End our suffering and just die
[0:25:15] <leomuratore> @GiantPapaDoug Exactly. And it levels up like crazy when you upgrade armor
[0:25:16] <Halospaz117> You made her a Jedi and shoved her back in the closet
[0:25:20] <tidalwafer> Hanharr is such an edgelord
[0:25:23] <phatmac16> Can you let her die?
[0:25:24] <agrippaarpeggio> @GiantPapaDoug that's a problem with pretty much every modern RPG with padding of constant resourse hunting and crafting
[0:25:24] <Mayachacha> where dem needles
[0:25:24] <%Gruhunchously> @hassanico2 Nah, Mira dies on Nar Shaddaa if you're dark side
[0:25:25] <ashenjuan25> You should just let her die tbh
[0:25:29] <StarlitStunner> Kill the overgrown Ewok! stripRage
[0:25:31] <+AsinPersuasion> speed
[0:25:37] <ashenjuan25> Man
[0:25:37] <hassanico2> @Gruhunchously ah, no granny revival huh
[0:25:39] <ashenjuan25> Mira sucks
[0:25:41] <phatmac16> Let her die
[0:25:41] <%jaytitan96> Remember kids. Users are Losers
[0:25:46] <ATPsoldat> Mira is bad, Hanharr as a character is worse.
[0:25:47] <%krispen_wa> SPEED
[0:25:49] <+Feralspirit41> Can she even use force powers in that armor
[0:25:50] <%DatAsuna> Conditioning
[0:25:51] <+kapcommunist> force wookie would be useful rn
[0:26:06] <CringeCommando> If you lose this fight there's a 6 and a half hour long cutscene of Hanharr voring Mira and digesting her slowly
[0:26:10] <ashenjuan25> At least hanhar adds something cool to the world Mira is just dumb
[0:26:17] <%Gruhunchously> Drugs drugs drugs
[0:26:18] <ralphfromdk> She's wearing a baaaaad mask
[0:26:23] <%krispen_wa> @cringecommando hot

[0:26:25] <ashenjuan25> Good I’d watch that

[0:26:33] <%jaytitan96> What happens if Hanharrs your party member?\
[0:26:37] <ashenjuan25> Wookiee Badger time
[0:26:40] <hassanico2> why did they give everyone that mask again?

[0:26:53] <Skeletonmanners> its got good stats
[0:26:54] <CringeCommando> @jaytitan96 Mira vores him
[0:26:55] <%Gruhunchously> Power sheild doesn't stop melee attack
[0:26:57] <%GiantPapaDoug> to be fair. neither mira or hanhar are very interesting. hanhar i would say has a bit going for him due to a cool lesson from kreia
[0:26:57] <Halospaz117> @jaytitan96 I think if Hanharr is the party member Mira dies on Nar Shadaa
[0:27:05] <%jaytitan96> OOF
[0:27:09] <hassanico2> BEEFY WOOKIE
[0:27:14] <%GiantPapaDoug> but both are just the unfortunate circumstance of 14 months
[0:27:15] <ashenjuan25> Mira has no redeeming qualities tho
[0:27:20] <%lotharrio> HE's not hitting THAT hard.
[0:27:20] <ashenjuan25> Except the obvious

[0:29:31] <+BubbaRands> 1

[0:30:46] <tranquilturnip> Imagine if he spoke like Niel Breen
[0:30:49] <ashenjuan25> Mira is the only character in the game that lacks consistency to justify their place in the world and is a bumbling fucking idiot

[0:33:29] <dinnydanny777> I bet Sith society is just like super clean
[0:33:33] <hassanico2> @furcifer93 that neon green is very similar

[0:34:27] <BurdRightsActivist> hey, if we go towards the 2020 Mad Max timeline, you can have all the leather and spikes you want! Hell, you can even have a DEATH CAR
[0:34:32] <subjectg> @halospaz117 the implication is that it’s been there pre-gravity squeeze
[0:34:34] <+AsinPersuasion> psh a melee build can do 100x5
[0:34:41] <%Gruhunchously> Planet is super fucked
[0:34:41] <ashenjuan25> I’m not really sure I’d want Disney to come back to this era
[0:34:45] <+evbites> i want the most evil tower ever to be home to the nicest people
[0:34:50] <IvesNapalm> I forgot just how much of a maze this place was
[0:34:52] <dinnydanny777> Would it be better if this planet had just died?
[0:34:59] <time_axis> I like how just turning on red lights makes republic ships look so evil
[0:35:00] <IvesNapalm> Its like a repressed memory
[0:35:00] <%DatAsuna> No
[0:35:05] <%krispen_wa> Console (Nothing)
[0:35:06] <Halospaz117> @subjectg Really? So was it just strong enough to survive that and lucky enough to still be accessible?
[0:35:07] <%DatAsuna> They're just power generators on ships
[0:35:17] <ashenjuan25> My old history teacher had a metallic throne I would always sit in a look super evil in
[0:35:24] <%VCRUZZO> @dinnydanny777 probably, yeah
[0:35:28] <hassanico2> Even if Disney comes back to this SWotOR butchered this didn't it?
[0:35:34] <ashenjuan25> Would get that Jarl Skyrim lean
[0:35:35] <%DatAsuna> Now I have the katamari song in my head

[0:35:46] <%Gruhunchously> @Halospaz117 It was built by the OG Sith, so I dunno. Maybe it's super alloy or darkside protected or something

[0:36:15] <dinnydanny777> This guy kicked his ass
[0:36:16] <Halospaz117> It was Malak's laundry guy
[0:36:16] <+jiggy_snipe> it's his body
[0:36:17] <+metamyriad> Pockets ditched Malak's corpse on Malachor like a champ
[0:36:19] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:36:20] <%krispen_wa> VENOM MALAK
[0:36:21] <+cowardman93> its fine
[0:36:22] <%jaytitan96> His armor from THE WAR
[0:36:22] <%Gruhunchously> Was Malak at Malachor V?
[0:36:23] <+pyrojack6> Darth Meatbag
[0:36:24] <GHouseduivel> Kreia moved on Malek, like a bitch
[0:36:24] <dinnydanny777> Revan discarded it here
[0:36:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 14 MONTHS
[0:36:26] <+LimpBisquicks> It's a Don Draper scenario, real Malak died here
[0:36:27] <OldManDeckardCain> it better look like a meatbag
[0:36:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 12 + 2 months
[0:36:28] <time_axis> I guess it's just "armor that Malak once wore and sold or gave away to a random soldier"
[0:36:28] <TurritopsisZer0Sum> MODS!
[0:36:28] <rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus where will chernaog show up on this kh1 planet lol
[0:36:37] <dinnydanny777> Revan said "I don't need this shit yeet"
[0:36:38] <hassanico2> Does Kreia mention Malak even once
[0:36:42] <+BubbaRands> how's you get here friend?
[0:36:43] <%DatAsuna> He wasn't Revan's apprentice
[0:36:45] <TurritopsisZer0Sum> Good o'l mods
[0:36:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> @krispen_wa Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
[0:36:46] <%DatAsuna> That's just wrong
[0:36:47] <jorniev> nmaybe it's his dirty old ball sweat armor
[0:36:47] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BELIEVED
[0:36:49] <BurdRightsActivist> LITERALLY NOTHING
[0:36:50] <rubbishbinge> Malak got all his clothes from a retail chain
[0:36:51] <%Gruhunchously> Wookiepedia
[0:36:54] <%DatAsuna> Well, not his jedi apprentice
[0:36:54] <CringeCommando> ONCE possesed, old crusty socks confirmed
[0:36:59] <Graxe_> "It is believed"
[0:37:05] <+BubbaRands> just a corpse
[0:37:05] <%Gruhunchously> It does not
[0:37:11] <mattynezz> It's super ugly
[0:37:15] <hassanico2> Malak wore red right?
[0:37:16] <ashenjuan25> Garth Dalak
[0:37:17] <%Irridium> maybe Revan took Malek's body and just dropped it onto this planet as a final "fuck you"
[0:37:18] <dinnydanny777> Are all Jedi and Sith outfits super cursed
[0:37:21] <+Urgoslav> Protected "famous" meatbag Malak, until it didn't.
[0:37:23] <%DatAsuna> Agreed
[0:37:29] <BurdRightsActivist> "IT IS BELIEVED"
[0:37:34] <%DatAsuna> The lore loot in this game is full of continuity errors
[0:37:34] <time_axis> well he probably had more than one outfit in his closet
[0:37:38] <%VCRUZZO> yeah it sucks
[0:37:39] <+MillerLowlife> its just something he wore once at some point in his life
[0:37:39] <%Reverend_Roscoe> IT IS BELIEVED
[0:37:41] <%Gruhunchously> 14 months
[0:37:42] <%krispen_wa> Alek's Armor
[0:37:43] <$JonnyCue> It was Malak's Wednesday underwear
[0:37:43] <hassanico2> oh so basically you want Dark Souls armor?
[0:37:49] <dinnydanny777> Malak really was a dumbass wasn't he
[0:37:49] <BurdRightsActivist> ""IT IS BELIEVED""
[0:37:50] <+cowardman93> they tried
[0:37:50] <e3a4> Its like "Jordans" The armor is just named after him
[0:37:52] <ashenjuan25> Rehab literally just threw out the airlock on his way out of the known galaxy
[0:37:54] <IvesNapalm> What if it was a armor he owned but tossed out the space window and it fell onto a dead body?
[0:37:56] <ashenjuan25> Revan
[0:37:57] <mattynezz> Revan's Robes from KotOR1 had the problem too
[0:38:03] <dinnydanny777> How did Malak think he would ever defeat Pockets, really
[0:38:14] <%BinaryFireball> TARKUS TARKUS
[0:38:14] <available_line> Dancer armor
[0:38:14] <BurdRightsActivist> Iron Tarkus isn't a boss though
[0:38:20] <hassanico2> I remember when DS3 added the Pursuer's shield except they used his actual name from the Japanese version instead of the one they made up
[0:38:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[0:38:20] <Halospaz117> @mattynezz Eh, I'm pretty sure that was still the same armor, just with the hood down and no mask
[0:38:21] <CringeCommando> I wish thrift stores would store the names of people who donated clothing, then you could get "KYLE MCGAVIN'S WOOL SWEATER"
[0:38:32] <%krispen_wa> Tarkus didn't die. He just took off his armor to do a no-armor run
[0:38:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Exwyanzed is my favorite Sith Lord
[0:38:39] <%Gruhunchously> Like, looks at how these ships have just been scrunched into the planet
[0:38:45] <mattynezz> @Halospaz117 No, it's pretty different. There's mods for that though
[0:38:52] <%mitchteck> I like the look of short and long lightsabers
[0:38:54] <Daxalog> Can you dual wield 2 shorties?

[0:47:48] <ashenjuan25> I would watch hanhar kill her
[0:47:48] <Halospaz117> It basically crunched the planet in on itself, as far as we know
[0:47:50] <%gatorafan> So... Where's G0-T0 in all of this?
[0:47:52] <memejima> It's some Sonic Unleashed shit

[0:48:04] <T_Sasquatch> Mass (Shadow) Destruction .... Baby baby baby
[0:48:04] <dinnydanny777> Isn't the mass shadow generator that thing Ansem was using in Kingdom Hearts 2
[0:48:06] <ATPsoldat> @gatorafan youll see
[0:48:06] <+AsinPersuasion> put it to rest
[0:48:13] <%Irridium> it will allow the planet to break
[0:48:14] <%lotharrio> Let it die.
[0:48:14] <surik_at> @DatAsuna funny right? it isn't. surikat is the russian word for meercat :D

[0:48:18] <+metamyriad> Mass Effect Generator

[0:48:31] <%Gruhunchously> Destroy is even harder
[0:48:32] <dinnydanny777> Mercy kill the planet
[0:48:33] <%DatAsuna> Lol small world
[0:48:34] <FiendishlyInventive> Still waiting for the remake of KOTOR 1/2 supervised by Chris Avellone, with the pitiful reality being we'll never get a remake of the best unfinished Star Wars story, never mind a faithful one.
[0:48:49] <%lotharrio> "I heard there might be a Mandolorian left on this planet. Remote... you know what you gotta do."
[0:48:50] <ashenjuan25> Beep doot do deet to
[0:48:59] <Dynamo_Commando> It’s like poetry, it rhymes.
[0:48:59] <hassanico2> the prequels had no real superweapon :)
[0:49:03] <+AeroXero42> If EA remade KOTOR is would be a disaster
[0:49:16] <%Gruhunchously> Throw a grenade
[0:49:19] <%DatAsuna> @hassanico2 the superweapon was anakin's dick
[0:49:35] <%Solareon_> @hassanico2 CGI was the superweapon
[0:49:36] <ashenjuan25> Ea would cancel a kotor series remake for being, “too ambitious,”
[0:49:40] <+evbites> @hassanico2 the clones and anakin
[0:49:40] <%VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna it truly was
[0:49:41] <ZeeJiggle> *Sound of distressed beep*
[0:49:42] <Daxalog> Can you heal?
[0:49:55] <shutupandjam3465> *beeping intensifies*
[0:49:57] <hassanico2> Was waiting for someone to say Jarjar at this point
[0:50:00] <mattynezz> It's almost the the evil Super Weapon isn't something destructive, but instead something that preserves something from the past, even when it should be let go...
[0:50:05] <+Urgoslav> Beep tomatoConcern
[0:50:07] <%DatAsuna> @ashenjuan25 the SWTOR team has been pitching a remake for years and EA keeps saying no
[0:50:11] <+Taylorton147> Thanks for the PrideLGBTea @rodreeg91
[0:50:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @hassanico2 that's DARTH Jarjar to you
[0:50:21] <hassanico2> @mattynezz like some kinda... echo...
[0:50:22] <%DatAsuna> They had at least 4 attempts
[0:50:25] <nothuzad> preserving an echo you mean mattynezz ?
[0:50:26] <dinnydanny777> To be honest would a KOTOR remake even be a good use of money for any company
[0:50:26] <%krispen_wa> EWW the SWTOR team is a big no
[0:50:27] <StarlitStunner> stripFear Beep @urgoslav
[0:50:30] <ashenjuan25> Like I said EA would claim it as, “too ambitious.”
[0:50:38] <%Gruhunchously> 73/7
[0:50:39] <dinnydanny777> Like for any company
[0:50:49] <hassanico2> hey remember when EA canned Amy Hennig's star wars game but kept the script
[0:50:50] <FiendishlyInventive> Nah, Disney's never going to allow it- because a modern TSL would show up literally how shit and nothing every other Star Wars story in comparision.
[0:50:50] <+mars_driver> @DatAsuna Of course not. Can't put lootboxes in a remake
[0:50:54] <%Gruhunchously> That's pretty much it
[0:50:56] <%jillpilled> LUL
[0:50:58] <%Irridium> @DatAsuna I think Obsidian also tried pitching a Kotor 3 several times and were denied
[0:51:02] <T_Sasquatch> That was pretty good
[0:51:03] <+evbites> bao durr: my legacy is mass destruction
[0:51:05] <+cvp5127> oof
[0:51:06] <prime_name> THE NEW SKIN SUCKS
[0:51:12] <%Gruhunchously> Oh joy
[0:51:16] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck that costume. I don't care
[0:51:16] <+HollowMan190> ....I don't get it
[0:51:17] <rosemon5001> F
[0:51:17] <hassanico2> ughhhh the alien skin
[0:51:18] <%jillpilled> what happened?
[0:51:18] <@Commando_Joe> Heroes of the Storm Zarya has 1000000% better skins than Overwatch Zarya @WoolieVersus
[0:51:19] <surik_at> @DatAsuna didn't they just shut down the fan remake?
[0:51:20] <ATPsoldat> What does it look like?
[0:51:22] <%VCRUZZO> its sad
[0:51:23] <ZeeJiggle> Everyone was new at the game so they didn't know the callout to split
[0:51:24] <%gatorafan> they still get costumes?
[0:51:24] <BurdRightsActivist> FUCK THAT COSTUME
[0:51:24] <RedTako> alien
[0:51:25] <SixthSun2> Also, the winner quit Overwatch
[0:51:25] <+evbites> ew alien
[0:51:27] <shutupandjam3465> a kotor 3 wouldnt be a sequel to kotor 2. it would be a sequel to 1
[0:51:29] <AppleBerryKitty> Psst Yall tell woolie about demo windjammers 2?
[0:51:29] <T_Sasquatch> Goth Zarya is hot tho
[0:51:31] <%Irridium> I mean her one skin with the bear ushanka is neat
[0:51:32] <+captain_history> SWTOR team made already obvious they kind of dislike this game
[0:51:32] <%GiantPapaDoug> at this rate i dont want anything done with kotor when i have no faith in the people in control of the ip
[0:51:32] <%DatAsuna> @Irridium Obsidian had initial script pitches but not a demo to submit
[0:51:33] <huskarl_zap> team fortress 2 still number 1
[0:51:35] <BurdRightsActivist> @SixthSun2 GOOD.
[0:51:35] <dinnydanny777> Like it's a good game but it would cost a lot and take a lot of time to remake it and I don't think this game sold a ton or anything
[0:51:36] <hassanico2> @ATPsoldat an ugly alien wearing a bad looking suit
[0:51:37] <ashenjuan25> But who’s hyped for Squadrons?
[0:51:39] <mattynezz> RIP Soldier
[0:51:39] <RantingRavager> Rip Soildier's VA FeelsBadMan
[0:51:42] <TheGunrunner91> I feel bad for the person that designed it, but yeah her skin is so eehh
[0:51:44] <%GiantPapaDoug> better to get nothing than something garbage
[0:51:46] <+logoth_> Havent had a good hero shooter for awhile :(
[0:51:48] <Doodle_Taco> Man that skin sucks
[0:51:49] <BurdRightsActivist> The Virgin Community Voted Skins vs THE CHAD COSMETIC ITEMS
[0:51:50] <ATPsoldat> RIP Rick May
[0:51:51] <%Gruhunchously> RIP Rick May
[0:51:53] <%jillpilled> RIP Rick May :(
[0:51:54] <%GrassCannon> The power of waifus compels you
[0:51:54] <nothuzad> yea soldiers VA died like a month ago
[0:51:56] <hattrick61> oh thats bad
[0:51:56] <sANfouR44> Here comes the revelation
[0:51:57] <%DatAsuna> @captain_history the SWTOR team has changed a lot over the years and karpyshyn wrote the bad kotor 2 links hen left early on
[0:52:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> TF2 Solider is more appealing than any Overwatch character
[0:52:04] <BurdRightsActivist> rip SOLDIER
[0:52:08] <%alpacasintophats> well duh
[0:52:11] <nothuzad> CanadianAnimatorGuy agreed
[0:52:18] <ZeeJiggle> Those "Meet the" videos are classics.
[0:52:19] <+Deko_> yeah tf2 characters way more personality than a lot of overwatch characters
[0:52:19] <%VCRUZZO> @shutupandjam3465 at this point given how much they shat on kotor 2 with the books and swtor, your right
[0:52:20] <%Ashenik1> Man I wish one KOTOR fan becomes a shareholder in EA and will keep pushing on getting a KOTOR Remake :<
[0:52:20] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:52:20] <ashenjuan25> Didn’t the swtor writers kind of fuck revan
[0:52:26] <%DatAsuna> @captain_history Can't really consider the whole game one tam since it was 9 writing teams with high turnover
[0:52:30] <Daskolin> Any TF2 charachter is better than overwatch ones
[0:52:32] <%alpacasintophats> the man is a good goddamn classic
[0:52:36] <%Gruhunchously> True
[0:52:37] <dinnydanny777> Yay more ASMR with Bao Dur
[0:52:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> What you're doing to the planet is essentially mercy-killing a zombie
[0:52:40] <%jillpilled> all the TF2 cast has infinite more personality than OW or most Blizzard stuff
[0:52:40] <FiendishlyInventive> Yeah but like who cares when nothing's as good as KOTOR 2.
[0:52:42] <shutupandjam3465> oh shit
[0:52:46] <shutupandjam3465> here we go
[0:52:47] <%FallenAngelZelos> That's a good whisper boy

[0:53:47] <+captain_history> @DatAsuna Yeah, that's true. Also KOTOR 2 had some people really disliking it at first.

[0:58:54] <hattrick61> A true Barth
[0:58:55] <Joostebrood> not sure if Atton's built right for this
[0:58:57] <Doodle_Taco> YEYEYEYE

[0:58:57] <%Gruhunchously> Apprentice fight!
[0:58:57] <%tuesti> YEYEYEYE
[0:58:58] <Halospaz117> YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOSE THIS
[0:58:58] <dinnydanny777> Is Atton the main character?
[0:58:59] <%chaoticknuckles0> Peace out Nerds
[0:59:01] <%Jetzord> The hardest fight when I played
[0:59:02] <shutupandjam3465> this is the coolest game ever i swear
[0:59:03] <AntifaCatboy> This is cut too
[0:59:04] <%VCRUZZO> its such a shame
[0:59:05] <derap41> What even is in the base game
[0:59:09] <Daxalog> Also SAVE
[0:59:10] <%DatAsuna> There are 2 outcomes to this fight including if you lose
[0:59:13] <dinnydanny777> Is Atton basically the main character
[0:59:18] <shutupandjam3465> SAVE
[0:59:18] <Halospaz117> I don't think he does in non restored content actually
[0:59:18] <ashenjuan25> Ye
[0:59:21] <MyNameIsRasus> DON'T LOSE
[0:59:21] <shutupandjam3465> SAVE SAVE SAVE
[0:59:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:59:22] <derap41> Is there even anything in the ending
[0:59:22] <+cowardman93> that sounds terrible
[0:59:23] <hassanico2> whaaaat
[0:59:34] <endarren> I think the Atton part wasn't in the PC Kotor II release
[0:59:36] <Halospaz117> Or maybe I didn't make him a Jedi with non-restored game, I dunno, I've been wrong before
[0:59:37] <+cowardman93> jesus
[0:59:38] <Dave_VD> Yeah losing this fight actually gets different results
[0:59:38] <ashenjuan25> Atton was supposed to be in Jedi knight remember?
[0:59:42] <prince_johnny_> wow
[0:59:45] <ashenjuan25> Hahahaha
[0:59:46] <momo25247> No he doesnt in vanilla
[0:59:48] <ashenjuan25> I don’t blame him
[0:59:49] <hassanico2> how reworked is this ending sequence?
[0:59:56] <Joostebrood> no the Atton-Sion sequence isn't in vanilla kotor II in any way
[0:59:56] <%krispen_wa> VERY REWORKED
[0:59:57] <+AsinPersuasion> extremely
[0:59:58] <dinnydanny777> Atton was supposed to be in Jedi Academy
[0:59:59] <IvesNapalm> Very
[1:00:04] <shutupandjam3465> over 50% reworked
[1:00:04] <OldManDeckardCain> about a few hours of difference LUL
[1:00:06] <mattynezz> The Exile still needs to send Remote a signal
[1:00:07] <%FallenAngelZelos> I thought atton's stuff wasn't in the base game
[1:00:10] <hassanico2> damn
[1:00:11] <+metamyriad> Good thing you're playing KOTOR 2: Scholar of the First Sin
[1:00:13] <ashenjuan25> Darth Simpotence time!!!!!!
[1:00:13] <+Dragoneye77> this is why kotor 2 sucks compared to 1
[1:00:13] <%VCRUZZO> it cuts, and the planet can still blow up so it makes it weird
[1:00:17] <%Ashenik1> Robot Planet the best part of the KOTOR 2
[1:00:18] <subjectg> Vanilla kotor 2 might as well not have an endig
[1:00:22] <%GiantPapaDoug> @hassanico2 there's a loooot that got removed from the ending
[1:00:37] <Halospaz117> YEP
[1:00:37] <Daxalog> Make sure to save. Its been a while.
[1:00:40] <%emperordread> Reminds me of Evangelion tbh
[1:00:40] <memejima> Oh god Atton may actually be able to kill Sion because of how good he is at psychological warfare
[1:00:41] <+Dragoneye77> Thus why Kotor 1 > Kotor 2
[1:00:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LIKE MASS EFFECT
[1:00:44] <YakumoYomi> 14 months~
[1:00:45] <FiendishlyInventive> Nah, even in this completely fucked state- Kotor 2's far superior to K1.
[1:00:46] <+Xchunkylover73x> Also if Atton dies now, he dies for real
[1:00:56] <shutupandjam3465> DONT LET ATTON DIE PLEASE
[1:00:59] <%VCRUZZO> Agreed V
[1:00:59] <huskarl_zap> kotor 1 is still better star wars
[1:01:01] <Halospaz117> Yeah this part is ironman
[1:01:02] <hassanico2> I can't even imagine what the Kotor 2 original experience was but I can imagine the negative reception
[1:01:03] <ashenjuan25> Let Mira die
[1:01:03] <%Irridium> even with how fucked it was, I still preferred KOTOR 2 back in the day
[1:01:04] <AntifaCatboy> I still prefer unmodded Kotor 2 over Kotor 1.
[1:01:04] <%FallenAngelZelos> Kotor 1 has an ending, thus it is better
[1:01:07] <Nyfkieren25> save
[1:01:09] <%Chatterbox1991> you are describing the original, pre-patched ending of Mass Effect 3
[1:01:11] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS PART IS IRONMAN
[1:01:11] <+xtkxyz> kotor 2 rocks
[1:01:12] <%jillpilled> KOTOR 2 had FOURTEEN MONTHS
[1:01:12] <OldManDeckardCain> K1 still feels more like SW for better or worse
[1:01:16] <ashenjuan25> Kick Darth Simpotnece’s ass as atton
[1:01:23] <Daxalog> Also SAVE
[1:01:24] <subjectg> Kotor 1 has better encounter design, but 2 is far superior in story
[1:01:25] <megamonmon123> Rememeber kids, heroes use drugs
[1:01:28] <+kapcommunist> definitely drugs
[1:01:28] <+Dragoneye77> Restored content mod isnt kotor 2 though, thats a mod so it doesnt reflect the actual product and doesnt make up for kotor 2 being bad compared to 1
[1:01:28] <dinnydanny777> Is the game even worth playing without this mod
[1:01:29] <megamonmon123> drugs are light side
[1:01:32] <HomasxualBatman> Bruh i only ever finished this on the og xbox when it came out and man this shits blowing my mind!
[1:01:34] <%GiantPapaDoug> hell even the patched ending of Me 3 is still lukewarm cuz all we get are slideshows
[1:01:41] <ATPsoldat> Kotor 2 is a better story, Kotor 1 is the more "star wars" of the two
[1:01:41] <%alpacasintophats> have you ever heard the tragedy of darth 14 months the rushed?
[1:01:43] <rosemon5001> HARD DRUGS time
[1:01:44] <NickCaesar7> @woolieversus V is talking exactly how I feel about the Sequels
[1:01:47] <%brachydios777> An experience only pc users can enjoy
[1:01:55] <ashenjuan25> I prefer the og ending to the me3 redone ending
[1:01:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Use ALL the drugs
[1:01:57] <%Ashenik1> Kotor 1 is the fellowship of the ring and kotor 2 the return of the king
[1:01:59] <ashenjuan25> Both are shit
[1:01:59] <%alpacasintophats> still the best version of that 14 months meme
[1:02:04] <huskarl_zap> Kotor 1 was Bioware's formula being codified from there on.
[1:02:04] <+captain_history> Vanilla Kotor 2 is still far better written than Kotor 1 though.
[1:02:08] <+cowardman93> KOTOR 2 is a flawed great
[1:02:11] <FiendishlyInventive> Story > Gameplay, especially in RPGs. And K2's far better written than K1.
[1:02:20] <Halospaz117> YEEEEEP
[1:02:22] <BurdRightsActivist> 14 MONTHS
[1:02:23] <shutupandjam3465> i like nailla kotor 2 more than kotor 1 i think
[1:02:23] <%DatAsuna> Well not the only point
[1:02:27] <Halospaz117> CUT CONTENT IS DEATH
[1:02:29] <hassanico2> I feel "Echoes" wouldn't be such a meme either if they had time to be more subtle
[1:02:30] <ashenjuan25> Kotor 2 has the biggest story dick of any Star Wars media
[1:02:31] <dinnydanny777> Remember how Atton ran away in that cutscene?
[1:02:36] <dinnydanny777> He didn't...
[1:02:38] <MyNameIsRasus> 14 MONTHS IS DEATH
[1:02:38] <derap41> All of the yeps
[1:02:39] <huskarl_zap> So kotor 1 was the first step in modern WRPGs.
[1:02:43] <koolaid_kevster> APATHY IS DEATH

[1:04:14] <%VCRUZZO> I would say that Kotor 2 is far more interesting than 1. 1 feels like the SW experience but damn is 2 so interesting even in without RestoreMOD
[1:04:15] <dinnydanny777> Visas can literally see the force though
[1:04:16] <%MrMoonGoose> Aren Kae

[1:05:37] <tiduidu> Simo Hayha
[1:05:38] <Halospaz117> So yeah, Atton can lose that encounter, and Sion will fucking torture him to death
[1:05:43] <tiduidu> Also Winter War is kinda during WW2
[1:05:45] <dinnydanny777> Are those shadow troopers
[1:05:45] <ashenjuan25> Atton’s like Chapelle’s coke head character
[1:05:45] <%lotharrio> The deadliest sniper to ever live.
[1:05:52] <hassanico2> So I guess he ran away again
[1:05:54] <+Vampyro241> Isnt this restored as well?
[1:06:01] <+evbites> the pakk loves cocaine
[1:06:02] <+Dragoneye77> lord simp
[1:06:02] <%krispen_wa> PRO-TIP: There is no choice here. You can go both directions
[1:06:03] <eliudfs1> game doesn't end if Atton looses.
[1:06:05] <YakumoYomi> Atton is Tyrone?!
[1:06:05] <%VCRUZZO> what a Sub
[1:06:07] <Halospaz117> And the best part, in the Female Exlie route, Atton being killed by Sion is the only time he ever admits his love the the Exile
[1:06:09] <Prince_Robot> woolie and v seriously need to dod planescape torment after this cause its such a good companion game
[1:06:13] <%Space_Pagan> DARTH SIMPION

[1:06:43] <%krispen_wa> INTERESTING
[1:06:43] <%DatAsuna> I think it's super lame as is
[1:06:44] <BurdRightsActivist> The dude you're talking about took an anti tank round to the face and lived, literally too strong to die

[1:06:58] <feet_hands> i remember when i was a dumb baby this part took me weeks
[1:07:00] <YakumoYomi> Baldur's Gate 2 is SO good.
[1:07:04] <hassanico2> So you gotta hurt yourself to free 'em somehow?
[1:07:06] <chll0ne> what i miss
[1:07:07] <Dave_VD> it fits with the "echoes" and force link ideas
[1:07:09] <%DatAsuna> The alternative is not in the video because there's just no cutscene for it
[1:07:13] <%GrassCannon> But if he's taking their struggles away from them, shouldn't he be getting stronger?

[1:07:40] <%VCRUZZO> it would have been so damn cool if that was implemented
[1:07:41] <%krispen_wa> But if you're strong enough to kick ass even with that sacrifice, what does that say about you?
[1:07:50] <%DatAsuna> Honestly I say don't do both, just take the right path
[1:07:55] <shutupandjam3465> @ashenhuan25 fucking rihgt?
[1:07:57] <%DatAsuna> The left is nothing but NPCs and containers
[1:08:02] <chll0ne> theres a persona 1-2 Kappa
[1:08:04] <BurdRightsActivist> haha force lightning go BRRR
[1:08:04] <%DatAsuna> And you don't need the loot
[1:08:06] <Dave_VD> @CozyGUNNA Bao-Dur died, HK killed GOTO to save the remote and destroy the planet, and everyone teamed up to fight Kreia without Fann but they all got owned
[1:08:07] <resloxxx> Gotta get strong to protect those smiles
[1:08:11] <%VCRUZZO> @krispen_wa that your the shit

[1:08:15] <+Dragoneye77> Short, just like Jerma
[1:08:15] <%lotharrio> Honestly yeah. The left path is just sort of more fights and a single, unique crystal.
[1:08:18] <Parapattern> "Uh, I so bad at this!"

[1:23:40] <dinnydanny777> That enemy type looks a lot like a Reborn from Jedi Knight
[1:23:40] <Camail> its probably crushing your spine
[1:23:41] <Psyramics> you got blood vessels in there too
[1:23:42] <%mostly_simple> it squeezes arteries

[1:23:46] <%Irridium> Well, not if they just crush your neck/spine
[1:23:47] <%Javaa01> Force Choke looks hard enough that it probably constricts your arteries
[1:23:52] <ooblag> Kill hits organs
[1:23:52] <%mostly_simple> BLOOD FLOW
[1:23:53] <$NoWayRyanTatum> you cant use breath control to stop someone from crushing your trachea

[1:24:09] <%MrMoonGoose> DRINK
[1:24:10] <megamonmon123> naw youd still die provably
[1:24:13] <%GiantPapaDoug> it doesnt stop a motherfucker from crushing your windpipe
[1:24:13] <penitentpentwitch> If Force Choke goes hard enough, it breaks your spine and breathing doesn't matter so much.
[1:24:15] <+ondri21> @WoolieVersus thats why we have force crush. and you just physically crush the windpipe

[1:29:40] <ashenjuan25> What happened to Darth Simpotence?
[1:29:41] <tranquilturnip> Maybe it just morphed a crystal that he already had
[1:29:42] <huskarl_zap> SO the center of Malachor is a CRYSTAL? PogChamp

[1:29:45] <realdenimgiant> unstoppable crystal i think
[1:29:45] <%Ashenik1> Darth Woolie's Mom
[1:29:46] <Manly_Rose> Edd Boon would totaly call himself Darth Hurikkane
[1:29:51] <%brachydios777> Definitely makes no sense
[1:29:51] <penitentpentwitch> Would it be better lore if Light Saber Crystals are kidney stones of dead Sith/Jedi?
[1:29:52] <ashenjuan25> Did he flake out of existence?
[1:29:55] <+evbites> Darth awu
[1:29:55] <%krispen_wa> IT SUCKS
[1:30:03] <Joostebrood> that is decidedly meh for the late-late-game
[1:30:07] <realdenimgiant> kaiburr is better for caster
[1:30:08] <+AsinPersuasion> its mace windus crystal
[1:30:08] <dinnydanny777> Unblockable?
[1:30:10] <GHouseduivel> @penitentpentwitch It would have cost nothing to not have said that
[1:30:12] <SekishinFist> Darth TR-8R
[1:30:14] <+BubbaRands> Partially
[1:30:16] <%DappercatEsquire> Shut up
[1:30:25] <%Irridium> I figured he just always had it
[1:30:25] <time_axis> common enough to have a name
[1:30:25] <%lotharrio> Very rare
[1:30:26] <%alrobot2014> common enough to be known
[1:30:26] <ashenjuan25> That’s 12 year old edge level
[1:30:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why would Anakin create a standard issue protocol droid?
[1:30:29] <+AsinPersuasion> yeah 1d8 damage cant be stopped if the attack hits
[1:30:30] <AnacondaVirtue> Because that's not what happened. They didn't make it. Their spirit just imprinted onto it

[1:30:38] <ashenjuan25> Can Mira die yet?
[1:30:42] <huskarl_zap> it was in the first game
[1:30:42] <SummonerMagno> it just works
[1:30:42] <memejima> Either that or he had a crystal that his death changed
[1:30:47] <+Urgoslav> Some people shit their pants so hard upon death, that an unstoppable crystal is created.
[1:31:03] <%DappercatEsquire> incel block
[1:31:03] <Dave_VD> He died so hard that he became part of the loot table
[1:31:05] <%DSD24> A lot of mental torture that's for sure
[1:31:08] <penitentpentwitch> "Making Diamonds"
[1:31:10] <dinnydanny777> He was locked in a cell with a sword

[1:31:21] <realdenimgiant> das a good crystal
[1:31:22] <+AsinPersuasion> ankarres is decent
[1:31:25] <ashenjuan25> So Jedis can shit krystals upon death?
[1:31:26] <%DatAsuna> The jedi DID genocide every sith they could after naga sadow
[1:31:31] <%lotharrio> They were "Sith."
[1:31:31] <eliudfs1> apperently it was Mace Windu's crystal according to wookipedia
[1:31:31] <+slimmixrp> This is the boss fountain
[1:31:32] <%DSD24> Are we gonna find a Diamond next?
[1:31:33] <+AsinPersuasion> its a lightsaber crystal yeah
[1:31:35] <time_axis> the Jedi probably wouldnt just keep the bodies lying around. I imagine they'd bury them at least
[1:31:42] <+AsinPersuasion> i got 2 of those
[1:31:45] <%Reverend_Roscoe> fuck
[1:31:50] <+AsinPersuasion> my last playthrough
[1:31:51] <+evbites> Darth CokknBal and done
[1:31:53] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but genociding the Sith is light side because the Sith are dark side right, even if we wiped out their entire race, right?
[1:31:56] <%DappercatEsquire> "crystal heals, and... uh... other stuff, too"
[1:31:58] <%DSD24> Man all this cool shit you don't get to use

[1:33:50] <%alpacasintophats> Darth Kalameet
[1:33:51] <derap41> just some casual torture
[1:33:54] <%jillpilled> Revan is an abstract concept
[1:33:55] <%emperordread> I am the Revan Ikari in Asuka's mind
[1:33:56] <%DappercatEsquire> My ideal Revan is 5'7", red hair, HUGE TITS
[1:33:57] <%jillpilled> :)
[1:34:00] <%Ashenik1> Revan fills THESE POCKETS
[1:34:04] <%krispen_wa> Revan is just Keanu Reeves
[1:34:09] <+Dragoneye77> SWTOR implies he tried to stop the emperor again and failed
[1:34:11] <%GrassCannon> The real Revan is the friends we made along the way
[1:34:13] <ashenjuan25> Nah pockets is my cannon revan
[1:34:15] <huskarl_zap> council = mind break

[1:34:36] <dinnydanny777> Huh so following orders is morally grey
[1:34:38] <%krispen_wa> Nothing is canon
[1:34:40] <%FallenAngelZelos> It's like trying to adapt Commander Shepard
[1:34:42] <%krispen_wa> Everything is headcanon
[1:34:43] <%DatAsuna> Revan's the least fun part of swtor yeah

[1:35:02] <%jillpilled> Almost every Revan is valid. Besides SWTOR Revan, fuck that one
[1:35:02] <CringeCommando> Revan retired to golf planet for the rest of his days. When asked about the "Star Wars" raging around him, he said "I convinced a million other stooges to pay me $17.99 a month to save the galaxy for me"

[1:35:05] <+evbites> thats good
[1:35:06] <momo25247> Get crumpled
[1:35:06] <%SmoothEnigma> SWTOR is canon to KOTOR but none of this is canon to the main canon so fuck it

[1:35:22] <surik_at> I'm not sure it's mentioned in the dark Revan run - but Revan pissed off after he regained the last of their memories @WoolieVersus
[1:35:31] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR turns the Exile into not-Exile, so it arguably isn't canon
[1:35:31] <+Dragoneye77> they made him like a grey jedi but hes still a jedi so meh
[1:35:33] <%Ashenik1> you cannot
[1:35:34] <%DatAsuna> Lowkey the exile gets it way worse than Revan
[1:35:35] <%Space_Pagan> I hate swtor's Revan
[1:35:36] <Archmortal> So what you're saying is IT CAN BE DONE
[1:35:44] <Lancaster_H> @CursedNobleman that's fucking strong
[1:35:45] <+AsinPersuasion> grey jedi are lame anyway
[1:35:48] <+AsinPersuasion> apathy is death
[1:35:51] <%Gruhunchously> This whole map is restored content
[1:35:53] <ashenjuan25> Yeah kotor series ended at kotor 2 for me
[1:35:55] <chambatron> Thanks for the PrideStrong @double_tap_that
[1:35:57] <%Ashenik1> @DatAsuna I was so fucking pissed when I read the book!!!!
[1:35:59] <ashenjuan25> Swtor is fun fan fic
[1:35:59] <%DatAsuna> I don't despise swtor's revan, I despise the book's revan
[1:36:01] <tranquilturnip> at least FF7r Cloud seems pretty well received
[1:36:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Immortality Kappa
[1:36:08] <dinnydanny777> Darth Depression
[1:36:10] <+evbites> just make reven have violent mood swings

[1:36:18] <CursedNobleman> Darth Anxiety
[1:36:19] <%krispen_wa> GO BACK
[1:36:21] <vaderxyz1970> Prototype 2 :(
[1:36:24] <%DatAsuna> @ashenjuan25 well you say that but the shitty book is by the lead writer of kotor 1
[1:36:25] <%Gruhunchously> Aren't your party members supposed to be here?
[1:36:33] <dinnydanny777> Darth Selfloathing
[1:36:35] <+AsinPersuasion> ah yes book reven where exile wasnt a wound in the force but super light side strong
[1:36:42] <CursedNobleman> Darth Sleep Paralysis
[1:36:44] <%DatAsuna> So it sucks but Karpyshyn is basically he Lucas of Revan, ruining it later
[1:36:46] <surik_at> @DatAsuna Really? Never got to read them but SWTOR revan was reaaaally underwhelming
[1:36:47] <%StryderStrikesAt> what would work is to adapt Kotor 2 into a movie with occasional flashbacks to Revan with the events being interpenetrated by whoever is doing the flashback
[1:36:49] <%krispen_wa> How did Drew make a decent KOTOR I but the TERRIBLE Revan book
[1:36:50] <ashenjuan25> So how does the book fuck revan up I’m curious I haven’t looked at it but heard it fucks it up bad
[1:36:52] <dinnydanny777> Darth Misery
[1:36:55] <+evbites> Darth i've fallen and can't get up
[1:36:56] <%DatAsuna> But since he's the OG it's more canon
[1:37:00] <%ACrystalSage> The real adventure was the corpse (nothing) we discovered along the way

[1:37:34] <+Dragoneye77> Arguably the staffs here are stun staffs
[1:37:37] <$StaceMcGate> Imagine being a stealth build right now
[1:37:37] <ashenjuan25> Well kotor 1 is a bit overrated imo and the best part of kotor 1 was the over arcing lore rather than the character writing
[1:37:44] <+BubbaRands> HE'S RATHER FLEX IS MUSCLES
[1:37:48] <+AsinPersuasion> why is he spamming normal crit strike
[1:37:48] <%DatAsuna> The best part of the revan book however is him shitting on atris
[1:37:49] <dinnydanny777> Darth "do you have earwax build up"?
[1:37:51] <+AsinPersuasion> cringe
[1:37:56] <%Space_Pagan> Swtor's Revan is Vergil from DMC 5... Split myself in twooooo
[1:37:57] <SereneFox> Yeah, it's on the WAY in, you're in now so they can kill you
[1:37:58] <hyphenated_q> They aren't harming him. However hard they try

[1:38:35] <%DatAsuna> I actually like his look
[1:38:35] <playdohface> Revan was “cool” retroactively and then Drew made him kind of lame mind slave at the end if the book
[1:38:38] <+evbites> Darth Fucking yikes
[1:38:39] <dinnydanny777> Darth Woops
[1:38:44] <%dollarstored> "I found a potion!"
[1:38:44] <dinnydanny777> Darth Meh
[1:38:45] <%brachydios777> Are we still doing the Darth thing?
[1:38:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Here I come, rougher than Knuckles The best of them, tougher than Knuckles You can call me Knuckles, unlike Knuckles I don't chuckle I'd rather flex my Knuckles
[1:38:51] <ashenjuan25> The Tusken raiders in kotor 1 will always be amazing tho

[1:39:30] <playdohface> Darth IT WAS ME AUSTIN! IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!
[1:39:31] <%DatAsuna> One thing that I say is definitely a fault of the readers is that a lot of people take stuff literally when half the book is switching perspective and making bad assumptions

[1:40:45] <Graywolf_the_45th> a reminder that the names George Lucas thought out for Starkiller during the development of SW The Force Unleashed were "Darth Icky" and "Darth Insanius"

[1:41:30] <+Dragoneye77> I really dont like her to be honest
[1:41:31] <penitentpentwitch> She's the rare villain that actively fought to keep the hero safe for most of the story

[1:41:34] <%DappercatEsquire> yo fuck the force
[1:41:34] <+Dragoneye77> I think shes a bad character
[1:41:35] <KessOrangeSoda> I love Kreia because she made me think in new ways.
[1:41:36] <shutupandjam3465> @ooblag this
[1:41:38] <dinnydanny777> Darth Genius Kojumbk
[1:41:39] <ashenjuan25> Absolutely
[1:41:45] <playdohface> I feel like Darth Vwhatever his name is was just a rewashed version of Nihilus
[1:41:45] <+evbites> arth Floo
[1:41:50] <%Space_Pagan> God damn I'm gonna miss this playthrough after it ends
[1:41:51] <%Gruhunchously> Did we find our party members yet?
[1:41:56] <%krispen_wa> Kreia is the best part of the expanded lore
[1:41:57] <ashenjuan25> She’s like Ayn Rand in Star Wars
[1:41:58] <CringeCommando> I became a master of video games but now I hate them all BibleThump
[1:41:58] <memejima> To not want people to overrely on magic bullshit is always a good fucking character concept
[1:42:03] <+xtkxyz> with the death of kotor 3 we lost so much BibleThump
[1:42:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> DARTH GRIFFISU
[1:42:08] <%DatAsuna> Having read all the lore, she's still one of the best
[1:42:11] <ashenjuan25> And just as evil
[1:42:12] <akman14> Darth Kira Queen
[1:42:12] <dinnydanny777> Darth Stan
[1:42:14] <GHouseduivel> @ashenjuan25 Except Kreia is likeable
[1:42:14] <+Dragoneye77> Im sure it'll be fine :)
[1:42:16] <+AsinPersuasion> eww dont compare kreia to fucking ayn rand
[1:42:21] <+evbites> Darth Soft n Wett
[1:42:21] <emeraldskrull> I like how y'all in here acting like pokemon smile didn't just get announced. this is a game changer. Now I can brush my teeth.
[1:42:21] <%DSD24> You will know our names!
[1:42:23] <ashenjuan25> And not as dumb
[1:42:30] <FiendishlyInventive> This is THE BEST Star Wars has ever been, NOTHING else comes close.
[1:42:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Darth Dio
[1:42:32] <+Feralspirit41> I honestly love the triumvirate as a whole and what each of the three of them; Kreia, Sion and Nihlus represent
[1:42:37] <%Gruhunchously> A recurring character type written by Chris Avellone is a character who is 100% done with the organization they are or were part of.
[1:42:42] <ashenjuan25> Make no mistake Ayn Rand is a piece of shit
[1:42:43] <+AsinPersuasion> i never took mu exams in a gym
[1:42:46] <+therabbles> Woolie wants the final lessom
[1:42:49] <%Ashenik1> Because it was written by a person who wasnt a simp fanboy but by a person who hated Star Wars at the time. When he waas assigned to write this shit he was like: OK what I used to love about Star Wars and what makes it work.
[1:42:53] <%DappercatEsquire> all midichlorians are bastards
[1:42:53] <dinnydanny777> Darth Sadness
[1:42:53] <%krispen_wa> Woolie will not be disappointed
[1:42:54] <Graxe_> I think Chris Avellone said in an interview that he used Kreia as a mouthpiece to talk about the thing he hates about the Force.
[1:42:54] <hassanico2> I'm guessing Kreia's the verbal boss battle but Nihilus is the phyiscal one?
[1:42:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Darth Finals
[1:42:55] <penitentpentwitch> She seems the type to monologue when her HP is 0.
[1:42:59] <+Urgoslav> Kreia made you a promise that there would be words if you graduate.
[1:43:00] <dinnydanny777> Darth Insecurity
[1:43:01] <ashenjuan25> And so is kreia to a certain extent
[1:43:02] <+evbites> Darth prolapse
[1:43:07] <silverira> Darth Taxes
[1:43:08] <%DatAsuna> @Ashenik1 False
[1:43:12] <+Dragoneye77> @WoolieVersus pride and acomplishment
[1:43:23] <SereneFox> Do those speeches actually happen outside of anime or tv shows or games?
[1:43:26] <ooblag> Hey V, you know the CHEESEY line you can say to Kreia before the thing, do you plan on making Woolie choose it?
[1:43:26] <%DSD24> You have at least killed 100 people by noew
[1:43:30] <dinnydanny777> Darth Darklord
[1:43:30] <%Irridium> poor dude behind the door
[1:43:36] <%krispen_wa> I've had a lot of teachers give me final speeches
[1:43:37] <%Ashenik1> @DatAsuna yeeeees?
[1:43:48] <neilgilbertg97> Dark Cucklord
[1:43:48] <%Gruhunchously> They had no time
[1:43:50] <+wunp_fxs> Woolie the ending is a fucking mess in vanilla
[1:43:51] <%DatAsuna> @Ashenik1 Avellone didn't say he hated it, he said he'd only seen the movies and thought he'd grown out of it, then he rewatched the movies and read the 90s comic and "rekindled his love" for star wars
[1:43:52] <dinnydanny777> Darth Demonlord
[1:43:57] <%Irridium> To be fair she did still have stuff in the original, but not as much
[1:44:01] <+logoth_> More where that came from!
[1:44:05] <Halospaz117> It's why KOTOR 2 was dismissed for so long
[1:44:05] <%brachydios777> There is no point playing the Xbox version
[1:44:06] <playdohface> Only cool part of the book was the stuff with Candorous and the part where Revan used lightning, everything else fell flat
[1:44:09] <%DatAsuna> @Ashenik1 Avellone never said he hated star wars, that's just people misinterpreting his actual words
[1:44:10] <shutupandjam3465> vanilla kotor 2 was good, it was just incomplete
[1:44:13] <%hzflank> my weird take: Kreia can see through the 4th wall and knows that the Force is the writer, and she wants free will
[1:44:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Down you go!
[1:44:14] <+evbites> Darth curb
[1:44:20] <+Urgoslav> Oops, main villain's motives had to be cut due to time contraints, sorry.
[1:44:21] <dinnydanny777> Darth Bugsnax
[1:44:21] <+Xchunkylover73x> TAKE A SHOT EVERY TIME THEY SAY Restore Content Mod
[1:44:22] <shutupandjam3465> absurdly incomplete
[1:44:22] <%krispen_wa> Vanilla KOTOR II is good until the endamge
[1:44:23] <memejima> A lot of the meat's in the main game, but the JUICINESS is in the restored content
[1:44:32] <%DatAsuna> And yeah owkey
[1:44:33] <$StaceMcGate> if only the combat system was more complex than spamming force lightining or rapid strike
[1:44:33] <ashenjuan25> The mod is so fucking wild to think about
[1:44:35] <+Dragoneye77> No
[1:44:37] <+Hinasil> Darth 14 Months
[1:44:37] <+AsinPersuasion> YES

[1:44:46] <shutupandjam3465> wut
[1:44:48] <+AsinPersuasion> AMAZING
[1:44:52] <%Ashenik1> @DatAsuna sorry maybe I remmber ''fallen out of love'' as ''hated'' ;p
[1:44:58] <+Dragoneye77> But there was no directors cut of kotor 2
[1:45:00] <mikash91> Vanilla was still strong on launch
[1:45:01] <+Dragoneye77> theres simply the mod
[1:45:02] <shutupandjam3465> its a masterpiece
[1:45:02] <penitentpentwitch> Kotor 2: Snyder Cut
[1:45:02] <%emperordread> Kingdom oh Heaven: DC is pretty darn good
[1:45:03] <+Dragoneye77> which doesnt count
[1:45:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> EXACTLY
[1:45:10] <subjectg> @hzflank as an addendum: since kreia sees the force as the writer, this means she’s right that the force exists only to perpetuate conflict, as that’s what star wars is to the audience
[1:45:15] <%DatAsuna> @Ashenik1 Regardless, he said he'd found his love again by the time he started writing.
[1:45:17] <dinnydanny777> Orlando Bloom pre Pirates of the Caribbean
[1:45:18] <playdohface> @datasuna i feel like Chris just didnt like the idea that everything was predestined according to the force
[1:45:19] <hassanico2> Saladdin cool dude
[1:45:21] <ostermox> which movie we talking about???
[1:45:21] <petwisk> the Snyder Cut
[1:45:22] <%MrMoonGoose> Which movie?
[1:45:23] <%Gruhunchously> Obsidian wanted to release a restored cut, but LucasArts wouldn't let them
[1:45:25] <samura1_queen19> Hi woolie and chat
[1:45:25] <%Ace_Clef> What movie is this?

[1:45:53] <ashenjuan25> Do y’all remember how kreia’s optimal path for you in Nar Shadda involves selling a refugee with child into slavery
[1:45:53] <%Irridium> The Snyder Cut will surely save Dawn of Justice Kappa
[1:45:55] <+AsinPersuasion> remember the part where they didnt explain that the MC already was a war veteran
[1:45:59] <+Takuatt> Just like the amazing upcoming Zack Smyders Justice League LUL
[1:46:05] <%DatAsuna> @playdohface Yeah he still is doing a critical deconstruction of star wars. It's just that people mistake that for hating star wars. It's like people misinterpreting woolie all the time and thinking he hates anything he criticises a little
[1:46:16] <+evbites> Cringe

[1:56:01] <%Irridium> there's a SWTOR endgame flashpoint boss that does that. He stuns your whole party except for 1 and that 1 has to 1v1 him.

[1:56:06] <%lotharrio> Juggling blasters.

[1:56:21] <+evbites> Nadd was probably the biggest jack ass ever
[1:56:23] <%Gruhunchously> Isn't there a power in Mass Effect that literally lets you shoot Biotic bullets?
[1:56:27] <+AsinPersuasion> 1 defense
[1:56:28] <%krispen_wa> So was Freedon Nadd just Gilgamesh with guns?
[1:56:31] <ashenjuan25> And by nads I mean blasters of course
[1:56:34] <baronvonbirman> Nadd's greatest dark power, Marketing!
[1:56:36] <+Urgoslav> He had 4 balls and was a sailor too, along with his 4 guns.
[1:56:38] <+AsinPersuasion> its 5% more survivability
[1:56:39] <+SarcFa> Wonder if Nad just had a good day at a shooting range one time trying out a bunch of blasters and the place just slapped his name on them to jack up the prices
[1:56:41] <Graywolf_the_45th> He used them like a pirate, just have a fuckload of guns on your body and you'll never run out of ammo

[1:57:48] <+AsinPersuasion> thats a neutral power
[1:57:48] <hassanico2> I don't like this game's OST
[1:57:53] <hassanico2> It's super forgettable
[1:57:53] <%DatAsuna> @Gruhunchously ah true, yeah
[1:57:59] <%Gruhunchously> What greater weapon is there than to turn an enemy to your cause?
[1:58:00] <ashenjuan25> The ost is great what are you talking about
[1:58:06] <+AsinPersuasion> just keep enlightenment up always
[1:58:06] <%krispen_wa> ngl i do like KOTOR I's soundtrack way better despite sounding less like Star Wars
[1:58:07] <%Gruhunchously> To use their own knowledge against them?
[1:58:15] <ashenjuan25> It’s got a dark Star Wars vibe to it
[1:58:19] <hassanico2> It's just the same orchestral movements for everything
[1:58:25] <%krispen_wa> But Rebuilt Enclave is waaaaaay better than anything in KOTOR I
[1:58:34] <%DatAsuna> I don't disagree
[1:58:36] <+kapcommunist> @DatAsuna i lol'ed
[1:58:41] <%DatAsuna> This game has many samey tracks
[1:58:42] <+evbites> damn pakk would kick pocket's ass
[1:58:43] <Joostebrood> I mean Mass Effect 3 had the good ending where you forced every sentient being in the galaxy to become a half-machine monstrosity.
[1:58:48] <%DatAsuna> However it has 3-4 absolute bangers
[1:58:50] <+addie_eels> wow pat somehow got nerdier and also less red
[1:58:52] <ashenjuan25> Light later
[1:58:57] <FiendishlyInventive> Mark Griskey is the best Star Wars composer, aside from Williams, it's a fact.
[1:59:00] <%DSD24> Destroy was the good ending in Mass Effect
[1:59:03] <%krispen_wa> The good ending was murdering the reapers and accidentally committing Geth genocide
[1:59:10] <%Gruhunchously> This game has five combat tracks that it breaks up into chunks
[1:59:11] <%Ashenik1> Did I miss anything?
[1:59:11] <%DatAsuna> Jesse Harlin made a lotta good star wars music too
[1:59:14] <%VCRUZZO> @Joostebrood yeah that ending has always been twisted to me
[1:59:15] <Manjove> Gethocide
[1:59:18] <%DatAsuna> and the Republic Commando hakkas are fab
[1:59:23] <ashenjuan25> Mass effect had no good ending
[1:59:25] <+AsinPersuasion> a skill woolie has not learned in any other game
[1:59:30] <momo25247> I really hope crunchy audio doesnt ruin the ending
[1:59:36] <FiendishlyInventive> Good Mass Effect ending is anything but Synthesis.
[1:59:39] <%krispen_wa> Mass Effect's good ending was the MEHEM mod
[1:59:40] <%DatAsuna> same
[1:59:42] <$Invlux> I thought V was telling us to chill monkaS
[1:59:44] <%Gruhunchously> Let me become Enlightened so I can kill you beter
[1:59:45] <Halospaz117> I AM CONFUSED AND FROZEN
[1:59:53] <Halospaz117> WHAT IS THIS HELL
[1:59:55] <+addie_eels> is this the first day doing this game?
[1:59:56] <%DatAsuna> Since the audio crunch affects the anime, we gotta hope they abort if it happens
[2:00:02] <Lee_The_Limey> let them fight! Kappa
[2:00:04] <%DatAsuna> cause even youtube isn't safe
[2:00:12] <ashenjuan25> I don’t think the original mass effect endings were meant to have a good or bad ending
[2:00:24] <%DSD24> Wow he did no damage
[2:00:24] <+thatotherblackkid> did he kill someone behind the door? lol
[2:00:30] <%lotharrio> "You and me, boss! We're gonna do i-!"
[2:00:37] <penitentpentwitch> It'd be funny if you could do like Borderlands, and level up mooks by having them kill each other
[2:00:40] <dinnydanny777> Is that a noble death?
[2:00:41] <Wheresmypassword> Friendly reminder that Woolie is passively eating the souls of every one of these guy s
[2:00:44] <%lotharrio> Lightning Gloves!
[2:00:44] <%Gruhunchously> It always sucks when you have to wait for possessed enemies to turn hostile again
[2:00:52] <ashenjuan25> “What was that no-“
[2:00:57] <dinnydanny777> It's more like you're mind breaking people into killing their friends

[2:01:47] <%krispen_wa> GO BACK
[2:01:48] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You should try to find you companions before moving on

[2:02:08] <hassanico2> Yeah this is waaaay too long
[2:02:10] <%DatAsuna> This is the choppiest part of malachor
[2:02:15] <%krispen_wa> Yeah, restoring a lot of the academy was a mistake
[2:02:15] <%VCRUZZO> take it back now ya'll
[2:02:15] <%jillpilled> This does drag, true
[2:02:18] <%M3djedx> Gotta save the fraaaands
[2:02:19] <penitentpentwitch> Technically, doesn't everyone that dies in The Exile's vicinity get soul eaten, regardless of if he was part of the fight or not?
[2:02:20] <ZeeJiggle> Finding multiple of a uniquely named thing is always funny to me
[2:02:21] <%VCRUZZO> one hop this time!
[2:02:31] <hassanico2> Like, half of these rooms probably was better off not restored
[2:02:35] <%M3djedx> Right foot two stomp

[2:02:48] <Halospaz117> I'd rather just buy the stuff
[2:02:52] <hassanico2> Ok what about Non-RNG crafting
[2:02:56] <prime_name> Xenoblade 2 Blade rolling
[2:02:57] <hassanico2> With like, minimal randomness
[2:02:59] <%M3djedx> Agreed
[2:03:05] <penitentpentwitch> I like crafting in FF14, but that IS RNG to a degree.
[2:03:08] <akman14> In skyrim as well
[2:03:10] <%krispen_wa> It's so easy to bork Morrowind. I love it
[2:03:15] <%jillpilled> Oblivion potions will break the game's economy
[2:03:18] <$StaceMcGate> Anchor Shot!
[2:03:20] <%Irridium> Morrowind is so much fun to break
[2:03:22] <%Javaa01> INFINITE WISDOM
[2:03:25] <Halospaz117> You can also jump across the entire map
[2:03:29] <+Purple_badger3000> WHAT THE HELL
[2:03:31] <%DatAsuna> prepare for shit content
[2:03:33] <+AsinPersuasion> and they werent in the prison
[2:03:33] <%DSD24> You could also give yourself negative stats so that training is cheaper
[2:03:34] <prime_name> This is where Mandalore was?
[2:03:34] <+jiggy_snipe> WHEN
[2:03:35] <$StaceMcGate> and they let them keep their weapons
[2:03:35] <SheefEatsBeef> WE GOTTA PAY BAIL
[2:03:36] <%krispen_wa> Where the hell was Mandalore during that fight?
[2:03:36] <+Purple_badger3000> This didn't trigger in my playthrough
[2:03:36] <%DatAsuna> don't worry about why cando is there
[2:03:37] <Tuna_Can_0> ah yes drinking until Im smarter
[2:03:38] <$StaceMcGate> how nice of the sith

[2:03:40] <%VCRUZZO> *sigh*
[2:03:43] <tattleworm> they got put in detention
[2:03:45] <+jiggy_snipe> when did Mando get caught?

[2:06:31] <samura1_queen19> Save or kill
[2:06:35] <ashenjuan25> Can we kill just Mira?

[2:06:45] <paris750000> Mmmm, Never learned who took my cookies in my fridge on the ship
[2:06:49] <ooblag> It's definitely place holder
[2:06:51] <Graxe_> This is totally Uchiha shit
[2:06:54] <+BlackLightRadia> It'd make more sense if it was like, the gas will happen but you jump in and save each of them, being weakened by the gas in the process
[2:06:59] <time_axis> "if you press the lever, everyone will die, but the trolley will do a sick loop de loop"
[2:06:59] <+evbites> save visas kill miri

[2:07:13] <+Snarksmith> This looks like the two options in a shitty mobile game ad
[2:07:15] <%krispen_wa> KILL QUINT
[2:07:15] <Wheresmypassword> Killing them is lightside. They may become Sith later without the guidance of a proper Jedi Council.
[2:07:16] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also this is not in the video cause there's no cutscene or anything if you kill them
[2:07:20] <SquigglyLizard> would woolie do it for a jetpack
[2:07:20] <hassanico2> Also wouldn't killing them CRIPPLE the Exile's power?!
[2:07:20] <ashenjuan25> Someone meme this screenshot

[2:07:32] <Joestar1890> You'd want to kill them because Sith
[2:07:32] <%heartlesshealer> Because by now they have immeasurable EXP for you to steal was probably the idea
[2:07:32] <%Irridium> anyone else remember The Pitt in Fallout 3 where you could eat the baby to become immune to radiation
[2:07:35] <%krispen_wa> LOOK AT THIS CUT CONTENT
[2:07:42] <%VCRUZZO> omg I forgot about this

[2:08:11] <+Urgoslav> I want McDonalds. Better use a behelit and kill my friends.
[2:08:11] <Joostebrood> (casual recycled dialogue)

[2:08:33] <%DatAsuna> Leave!
[2:08:33] <+therabbles> team or friends

[2:08:43] <IvesNapalm> no or no
[2:08:47] <%lotharrio> The evil one was to kill or ignore them.
[2:08:47] <308caliber> FOR MANDALORE
[2:08:49] <samura1_queen19> Aren’t they the same thing
[2:08:50] <+AsinPersuasion> wait whos the waifu brianna or visas?
[2:08:50] <$StaceMcGate> wait, which one is Woolie's waifu?
[2:08:50] <Joostebrood> honestly there wasn't enough og content for this restoration to be meaningful
[2:08:54] <%krispen_wa> WHAT EVEN IS THIS DIALOGUE
[2:08:55] <Doodle_Taco> YOU ARE MY FRIEND!!!
[2:09:01] <%DappercatEsquire> Are you a genial manager or a hardass, that's what that choice was
[2:09:02] <%DatAsuna> Also Atton isn't here
[2:09:05] <+jiggy_snipe> this face LUL
[2:09:10] <time_axis> I dont think having been here before helps him when the place is blown to shit and in pieces
[2:09:19] <jnaynnay> My friends are my power
[2:09:20] <prime_name> k byyyyeeee
[2:09:22] <%DatAsuna> Run awaaaaay

[2:09:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Aah~ ano hi no yume
[2:09:24] <%Gruhunchously> For Mandalore
[2:09:29] <%VCRUZZO> *sigh*
[2:09:30] <+Urgoslav> With the power of Friendship, Binary choices, and 14 months :)
[2:09:41] <starwars90001> Unlit the Purge.
[2:09:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:09:42] <$StaceMcGate> @krispen_wa dying in the Revan novels
[2:09:46] <hassanico2> Wait is the endgame seriously just us and Atton?
[2:09:47] <Halospaz117> Yeah in the original release, the rest of the party might as well have died when the ship crashed
[2:09:48] <%brachydios777> For Mandalore
[2:09:48] <ZeeJiggle> You go back to the computer and it's like "Activated Party Member Kill Chips"
[2:09:51] <+Feralspirit41> "mira wait i need you yo double check the cells for something"
[2:09:51] <DaBigVitus> why even ad that back in
[2:09:51] <hassanico2> Where's Darth T3?
[2:09:53] <gastherobots> I just binge read the first like 55 chapters of Berserk today so I'm glad I can appreciate the references now.
[2:09:54] <%krispen_wa> @hassanico2 yup
[2:09:54] <%Gruhunchously> ZE CHOICES
[2:09:56] <%Jpshum> x to sadness
[2:10:03] <Wheresmypassword> The best part is, you taught some of them breath control. Imagine hitting the poison button, opening up the cells for your F A T L O O T and they just stare at you
[2:10:04] <petwisk> 14 M O N T H S
[2:10:05] <IvesNapalm> Back in because it was in the code?
[2:10:09] <+shry7> Mandalore be like "ah shoot I left my keys in my cell"
[2:10:10] <Joostebrood> this feels like a shitty Fallout mod where they recycle dialogue so most of the key phrases are in the unvoiced player options
[2:10:11] <gammongaming11> wait kreia was supposed to talk to you and tell you she kept them there for you to kill and gain her power
[2:10:13] <%r0chelimit> it was the sasuke choice
[2:10:15] <%Irridium> T3 building his own academy
[2:10:15] <+therabbles> T3 is fulfilling his dark designs
[2:10:16] <Halospaz117> DARTH T3 IS ON THE LOOSE
[2:10:17] <ZeeJiggle> T3 is at Malachor 6
[2:10:18] <phatmac16> PRESS X TO KILL
[2:10:18] <%Ashenik1> T3 was Kreia all along...
[2:10:18] <+jiggy_snipe> droid adventures
[2:10:19] <%DatAsuna> T3 is just sat on the ebon hawk
[2:10:19] <+serpenttucker> You mean DARTH T3
[2:10:20] <gammongaming11> did that dialogue bug out?
[2:10:21] <%Space_Pagan> T3 is taking over the Republic as we speak
[2:10:23] <%Gruhunchously> DYEEHH
[2:10:24] <BurdRightsActivist> DARTH T3
[2:10:25] <ashenjuan25> 3. We’ll bang ok
[2:10:25] <neilgilbertg97> Secret final boss
[2:10:30] <Eger007> He's the true mastermind behind it all
[2:10:30] <tsnakesrule> T3 is doing Darth things
[2:10:33] <%M3djedx> T3 is busy committing genocide
[2:10:34] <+Urgoslav> brrrrt
[2:10:35] <+AsinPersuasion> hes fixin the ship
[2:10:38] <FiendishlyInventive> T3's onboard the Ebon Hawk.
[2:10:42] <ZeeJiggle> He's battling Traya RIGHT now.
[2:10:42] <time_axis> also I guess what GoTo said about him having a nuke in him that will go off if he dies, was a lie
[2:10:44] <Katanas69> Take a shot
[2:10:47] <Joostebrood> I guess T3 is flying
[2:10:48] <%heartlesshealer> ah, so Goto died for real
[2:10:49] <Joostebrood> the ship
[2:10:51] <FiendishlyInventive> Fixing it, again.
[2:10:53] <%Space_Pagan> Exploration End
[2:10:54] <+AsinPersuasion> TIME TO BEAT THE GAME
[2:10:54] <%Gruhunchously> The Ebon Hawk is currently falling into the depths of the planet
[2:10:54] <%krispen_wa> T3 is choking Darth Traya and taking her place
[2:10:55] <ZeeJiggle> Shock Arm vs Lightning
[2:10:57] <Joostebrood> Cause Atton is down here
[2:10:58] <%heartlesshealer> I missed that part of the streams
[2:11:09] <Joostebrood> (and the ship turns up later)
[2:11:11] <%VCRUZZO> it always made since without RestoreMod why he wouldn't be here, cause we just had a major battle in space, so we gotta hide from the Republic again
[2:11:13] <%gatorafan> Even the younglings?
[2:11:15] <LunarRemix> Hey man, greater good.
[2:11:16] <Wheresmypassword> They had it coming
[2:11:16] <%Gruhunchously> I like the idea that you just slaughtered a bunch of Sith younglings
[2:11:17] <tranquilturnip> Enlightenment by being the only mf left in the room
[2:11:20] <%lotharrio> From my perspective, the Sith are the villains!
[2:11:22] <hassanico2> @heartlesshealer he tried to stop Remote from blowing up the planet but HK stopped him
[2:11:23] <coracor> until the next book/game
[2:11:25] <Jmann1892> Gone LUL
[2:11:27] <%DappercatEsquire> gotta get that pent up sexual energy out somehow, so go do some murder
[2:11:28] <%jillpilled> especially the younglings
[2:11:29] <+Urgoslav> We keep murdering to find that answer!
[2:11:30] <+evbites> dash that baby
[2:11:32] <%krispen_wa> KILL THE CHILDREN TOO - Goblin Slayer
[2:11:32] <%jillpilled> fuck them kids
[2:11:33] <%M3djedx> From my point of view the Jedi are evil
[2:11:34] <%DatAsuna> Even the Yung Lings
[2:11:34] <+thelonechris> Younglings are extra points
[2:11:35] <ooblag> All you other Sith with your pumped up kicks...
[2:11:43] <%Ashenik1> they are in KOTOR 1
[2:11:44] <+metamyriad> L I G H T L A T E R
[2:11:45] <coracor> what a brave assassin
[2:11:46] <gastherobots> Jedi Council - "You can't just kill all these people and gain more p o w e r, it's against the Jedi Code!"
[2:11:47] <ashenjuan25> Gogone
[2:11:50] <%vaporousTippler> The young have so much potential. To do evil. Kill them.
[2:11:51] <gastherobots> Fann - "Fuck the code."
[2:11:52] <%VCRUZZO> but that moment made no since and Candos responses are so off
[2:11:53] <+CycloneEternalJoker> younglings are extra credit
[2:11:53] <%BisoromiBear> Younglings of the Corn

[2:12:18] <ashenjuan25> Especially the children
[2:12:19] <%Ashenik1> Anakin was colourblind
[2:12:22] <+AsinPersuasion> i dont believe that
[2:12:22] <%DappercatEsquire> Jedi do not espouse a growth mindset
[2:12:23] <+Urgoslav> Better dead than red?
[2:12:24] <+serpenttucker> To be fair they wouldn't be red unless there was a reason for it
[2:12:24] <Wheresmypassword> Something something only Sith deal in absolutes
[2:12:26] <BurdRightsActivist> SMT
[2:12:32] <%DappercatEsquire> Jedi also believe in eugenics
[2:12:36] <%Gruhunchously> My god what have I done

[2:14:25] <dinnydanny777> Darth Styling
[2:14:36] <%krispen_wa> Bastila was supposed to be Vima
[2:14:42] <%Gruhunchously> @StarlitStunner She was going to be Bastilla originally

[2:14:52] <ashenjuan25> Darth judgement nads

[2:15:04] <+AsinPersuasion> whos vima? nomis daughter?

[2:15:11] <+evbites> abduction
[2:15:12] <coracor> join us or we'll kill you
[2:15:13] <dinnydanny777> Darwinism
[2:15:17] <dinnydanny777> Natural selection
[2:15:22] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus read the Darth Bane novels
[2:15:25] <gastherobots> According to SWTOR "HE HAS FORCE POWERS, CONSCRIPT"
[2:15:25] <+evbites> cad bane

[2:15:27] <%redrins> you look strong, come with me

[2:15:35] <%DappercatEsquire> you weren't supposed to fuck
[2:15:35] <%VCRUZZO> Bane Chad
[2:15:36] <%Irridium> just throw any force sensitives into the academy and if they die they die
[2:15:39] <+shry7> Child soldiers
[2:15:39] <%Gruhunchously> We saw the Sith recruitment process in KOTOR 1
[2:15:39] <huskarl_zap> THE GAME WOOLIE MADE
[2:15:40] <%VCRUZZO> Chad Bane?
[2:15:42] <StarlitStunner> She was supposed to have a book called Mandorla but it got cancelled even though it was ready to print. @gruhunchously
[2:15:43] <dinnydanny777> If you drown you were weak
[2:15:45] <%heartlesshealer> either abduction or "hey, aren't you tired of being nice?"
[2:15:45] <%DSD24> You made this? I made this
[2:15:48] <Wheresmypassword> Also, Sith can just... make them, as opposed to Jedi
[2:15:49] <penitentpentwitch> So the Jedi are Catholic Priests?
[2:15:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Mandatory ascension
[2:15:52] <%VCRUZZO> Darth Chad?
[2:15:54] <+evbites> now your in our army
[2:15:57] <gastherobots> I love the idea of a massive cold war forcing both sides to just take on fucking every force sensitive they can.
[2:15:59] <Halospaz117> Sion "Why did you enter the room and immediately leave earlier?"
[2:16:04] <dinnydanny777> Remember when Qui Gon refused to pay off Anakin's mothers slavehood
[2:16:06] <%krispen_wa> Was he hiding on the ceiling?
[2:16:08] <derap41> Also fome Force mmind fuck so you don't freak oiut about us taking your kid
[2:16:08] <+Dragoneye77> "your kind" cmonBruh
[2:16:09] <accidentfish> what happens if a parent says no to the jedi?
[2:16:12] <dinnydanny777> Jedi code
[2:16:13] <hassanico2> Force Unleashed was cooler than it had any right being
[2:16:20] <+jiggy_snipe> they kidnap them
[2:16:21] <%Space_Pagan> THE SIMP IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE

[2:16:34] <shutupandjam3465> fun fact if youe female sion professes his love for you
[2:16:38] <+Urgoslav> You've got the D-package, believe in yourself
[2:16:40] <dinnydanny777> "Your mum's a bitch"
[2:16:41] <+tearfuldevil> @accidentfish they say "okay" and they keep watch in case you go evil
[2:16:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:16:45] <+evbites> 4
[2:16:46] <therat_giant> verbal boss battles, pogged up
[2:16:57] <accidentfish> @tearfuldevil fair enough
[2:17:00] <+kapcommunist> @dinnydanny777 LUL
[2:17:05] <%krispen_wa> WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
[2:17:09] <GHouseduivel> Whaaat, is this place?
[2:17:13] <ashenjuan25> The Jedi can be written as evil if done right
[2:17:14] <+serpenttucker> How convenient
[2:17:16] <samura1_queen19> Sion you’re an ugly mofo
[2:17:18] <Halospaz117> Oh huh, confirmation it came before the war crime, I forgot
[2:17:24] <%krispen_wa> THERE'S NO HULKAMANIACS HERE
[2:17:24] <%lotharrio> "Also, she said I was the better student. S-so don't even ask her about it."
[2:17:25] <ashenjuan25> Darth Simpotence
[2:17:27] <+evbites> the box does not judge it only hates
[2:17:29] <$StaceMcGate> This evil temple is surprisingly clean
[2:17:30] <+Purple_badger3000> Hungry Temple
[2:17:38] <$StaceMcGate> look how immaculate the floors are
[2:17:48] <308caliber> Sion’s practically immortal here
[2:17:49] <shutupandjam3465> @lotharrio LUL
[2:17:49] <GHouseduivel> Probably cleaning droids
[2:17:55] <surik_at> guess how revan picked this place
[2:17:59] <+Dragoneye77> Siths can also be ghosts though
[2:18:00] <%VCRUZZO> makes you wonder though how this place remained after the mass shadow generator. Was always curious about that
[2:18:03] <gastherobots> I mean the Sith are super jelly that they (mostly) can't force ghost.
[2:18:05] <+shapeforn> Hmm. Didn't think about that. Thats a cool take wools
[2:18:07] <accidentfish> @StaceMcGate just because they are evil doesn't mean the're slobs
[2:18:10] <Halospaz117> Hm, interesting perspective, never thought of that
[2:18:11] <%Gruhunchously> Sith janitor services are dictatorial
[2:18:12] <tubit> The temple was designed by Ivo Shandor
[2:18:13] <+Dragoneye77> Siths can be force ghosts though
[2:18:13] <dinnydanny777> You can canonically survive in space remember
[2:18:14] <$Invlux> Sith phylactery
[2:18:17] <+CycloneEternalJoker> the sith virus

[2:18:21] <huskarl_zap> sith africa
[2:18:21] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO propably cause BIG FORCE DICK ENERGY
[2:18:22] <%heartlesshealer> conversion*
[2:18:23] <SereneFox> A sith contingency plan
[2:18:27] <dinnydanny777> Force sensitive people can survive in space remember
[2:18:30] <penitentpentwitch> Wasn't paying attention, thought he said "Sith Booty Traps"
[2:18:37] <samura1_queen19> The Sith would be the Red ghosts
[2:18:39] <+AsinPersuasion> UNLIMITED
[2:18:40] <%gatorafan> Darth Toilet
[2:18:41] <dinnydanny777> You don't even need to be a trained Sith or a Jedi in fact
[2:18:43] <%DatAsuna> The jedi holocrons basically enable that since they get purged 3 times
[2:18:46] <%Gruhunchously> Being able to prevent the ones you care about...from dying...
[2:18:46] <+AsinPersuasion> POWAAAAAAAAAH
[2:18:49] <ashenjuan25> Darth I activated it 30 minutes ago
[2:18:51] <Eger007> MY chains are broken
[2:18:57] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 For a little while
[2:19:01] <%krispen_wa> @Gruhunchously Is it possible to learn this power?
[2:19:13] <Eger007> The force shall set me free
[2:19:14] <CringeCommando> This stream will be stored on a disk and buried for someone to find 10000 years later
[2:19:18] <%Gruhunchously> @krispen_wa Not from a Jedi
[2:19:18] <gastherobots> "You beat me, but I'm gonna leave some dark dank shit to fuck you over in the future anyways"
[2:19:20] <Shade075> No one ever really gone
[2:19:20] <CursedNobleman> what a muggle LUL
[2:19:21] <+tearfuldevil> @accidentfish the problem with calling what the jedi do kidnapping is that they didn't, you know, take kids against the will of the parents. being a jedi was seen as like, a prestigious thing, so most people wouldn't refuse. they did take in orphans though
[2:19:25] <dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 I guess but I imagine a trained Jedi or Sith could do it longer
[2:19:30] <huskarl_zap> Haruspex from pathalogic? PogChamp
[2:19:31] <+evbites> my soul is seperated into three items
[2:19:33] <FiendishlyInventive> Voldemort stucks though.
[2:19:33] <%heartlesshealer> Darth Riddle
[2:19:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Which came first?
[2:19:37] <%lotharrio> It's just lich phylactery shit.
[2:19:39] <$StaceMcGate> How to bully Harry Potter fans: mention J.K. Rowling
[2:19:39] <%Gruhunchously> Forbidden Evil Knowledge
[2:19:49] <FiendishlyInventive> Voldemort sucks though.
[2:19:56] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 hmm, so what your saying is the academy has a phalic force generator that acts like a shield...legit
[2:20:02] <nothuzad> just lich phylactery eap
[2:20:16] <ooblag> Yoda ghost could do whatever he wanted
[2:20:16] <%brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 I imagine, it’s theoraizied that regular people have 7 seconds
[2:20:20] <+tearfuldevil> @Engwithan_Elder_God lich phylacteries came ffirst, and that comes from Koschei the Deathless, a Russian mythological figure
[2:20:24] <shutupandjam3465> boo voldemort
[2:20:24] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if force ghosts were never meant to be real, Luke was just supposed to be having a mental breakdown
[2:20:25] <petwisk> Hatsune Miku writen Harry Potter

[2:20:39] <%krispen_wa> L O R E
[2:20:40] <+PhantomMiG> @woolieversus I Russian myth there is a character Koschei the Deathless
[2:20:44] <SereneFox> Ah, so the jedi don't kidnap, but the parents won't say no, because of the implication. They're 100% free to keep their children but because of the implication.
[2:20:50] <+evbites> hbo max has harry potter
[2:20:51] <derap41> An even older republic
[2:20:52] <arran_throttle> where did it go
[2:20:52] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO lets say the origin of this place was explained in a nsfw novel
[2:20:54] <%brachydios777> @samura1_queen19 Harry Potter is WB
[2:20:56] <dinnydanny777> The first two Harry Potter movies feel so different to every other Harry Potter movie
[2:20:59] <%DappercatEsquire> don't the true sith suck shit?
[2:21:03] <+tearfuldevil> @SereneFox nope

[2:21:09] <+evbites> also harry potter is waner bros
[2:21:09] <arran_throttle> where did it come from?
[2:21:10] <BurdRightsActivist> Do the sith just unzip their pants and wipe their Midichlorian Dick all over objects so the people who touch the objects get that sith juice in them?

[2:21:35] <%heartlesshealer> The Sith that the dark jedi became the Lords of
[2:21:36] <dinnydanny777> You know, the One True Sith, said the True Sith Scotsman
[2:21:37] <Jmann1892> The Sith People
[2:21:40] <FiendishlyInventive> Eldritch monsters according to Chris Avellone.
[2:21:42] <time_axis> wait for him to get there, guys
[2:21:43] <%DatAsuna> They're both
[2:21:52] <Halospaz117> I mean, they're not NOT the red guys, but also not only them
[2:21:55] <samura1_queen19> @brachydios777 then why do they have a Harry Potter theme park?
[2:21:56] <Gallhint> I know nothing about star wars, if there are original Sith are there also original Jedi?
[2:21:57] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus true sith as in the race, specifically from the Great Hyperspace War ere proabbly
[2:21:57] <%krispen_wa> Then SWTOR just made them the Empire
[2:21:58] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 time to do research then...for knowledge of course
[2:22:00] <%brachydios777> @samura1_queen19 Or I could be wrong, I know it’s not Disney
[2:22:09] <%VCRUZZO> it knda matters
[2:22:14] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO always
[2:22:21] <dinnydanny777> That's not true
[2:22:23] <$Fortunato5678> @samura1_queen19 Universal has the HP theme park
[2:22:37] <samura1_queen19> Really
[2:22:55] <%brachydios777> Yeah Harry Potter is universal
[2:23:01] <%VCRUZZO> So was Scion already like this when he was on Korriban?
[2:23:03] <ashenjuan25> sith=fallen Jedi Sith=sith species
[2:23:18] <Archmortal> Revan didn't BUILD all that much, Revan protected pre-existing military installations too
[2:23:21] <FiendishlyInventive> *Sion.
[2:23:23] <+shry7> that's a cool holocron led light in the background
[2:23:25] <dinnydanny777> Is this man held together by pure anger making his internalized insecurities

[2:23:40] <%DatAsuna> Revan was planning on taking it and just swapping out the pubs for his own guys as much as possible

[2:37:36] <dinnydanny777> Is it actually more humane to kill him considering the fact that he's literally falling to pieces?
[2:37:50] <Manjove> It is such a quiet thing to fall, but far more terrible is to admit it.
[2:37:50] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:37:51] <%M3djedx> Probably
[2:37:52] <+tearfuldevil> @dinnydanny777 only if he wants to die
[2:38:01] <+AsinPersuasion> the method isn't the point
[2:38:05] <+AsinPersuasion> the possibility is
[2:38:14] <+metamyriad> Sacrifice the force for more time on the clock
[2:38:15] <dinnydanny777> @tearfuldevil I guess but he must be in constant pain

[2:41:18] <%krispen_wa> Nihilus was just some dude
[2:41:23] <%alrobot2014> nah we're just in the boss fight against the load screen
[2:41:24] <%DatAsuna> There's one comic and the only thing it shows is katarr
[2:41:26] <Djinnazz> He was some rando sith that learned to survive by sucking the force out of everything.

[2:41:33] <Kirbachev> I always thought Nihilus was basically what the Exile would become if they had no self-control.
[2:41:33] <LunarRemix> Nihilus is the most pure 'Just evil' character

[2:41:56] <%SmoothEnigma> that's cause it cleared up guys
[2:42:04] <%krispen_wa> Was Nihilus still a person when Kreia was teaching him? Or was he just speaking in Eldritch at that time?

[2:42:19] <penitentpentwitch> 200% PAIN
[2:42:21] <%VCRUZZO> that was good
[2:42:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Kirbachev He's what the Exile could have become if they ended up relying on it at the expense of everything else.
[2:42:22] <Djinnazz> omg
[2:42:23] <%Irridium> Not even wrong
[2:42:23] <%heartlesshealer> okay good, it was just interface shenanigans <3
[2:42:28] <ralphfromdk> 0 % pleasure, 100 % pain
[2:42:30] <xBUBBA1995x> Of the two, Nihilus or Sion, Nihilus is cool and a horror, but Sion is the better in an aspect of a story. He's a broken mad, driven mad, who can't die, and you have to talk-no-jutsu him down. It's amazing.
[2:42:30] <Shade075> LUL
[2:42:32] <%Javaa01> Infinity% pain
[2:42:37] <+Urgoslav> Survived on crusts alone

[2:44:00] <Tomas2886Cz> good stuff
[2:44:02] <prince_johnny_> cant wait
[2:44:04] <snakemuho> ok imma go back and watch from the start
[2:44:05] <%VCRUZZO> read that one earlier
[2:44:35] <%DatAsuna> pragmatism over selfishness
[2:44:38] <time_axis> it's usually just binary things, like kill or dont kill
[2:44:40] <%VCRUZZO> basically
[2:44:55] <gastherobots> The best is when you can call out other Sith for being fucking dumb about how they go about everything.
[2:44:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:44:58] <%DatAsuna> I do like her little mantra
[2:45:14] <%krispen_wa> I love Agent's storyline is just looking at the SIth and realizing how fucking dumb they are from the outside
[2:45:20] <+charmquarke> The sith warrior gets a Jedi apprentice that they are teaching and it is actively working to subvert sith influence
[2:45:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Robots
[2:45:24] <+ktothec99> Star Wars Legacy comics explored it
[2:45:24] <%DatAsuna> Jaesa on the other hand is a terrible convert.
[2:45:25] <tattleworm> you're actively punished for grey in swtor, it sucks
[2:45:31] <+AsinPersuasion> are they breaking for dinner here?
[2:45:35] <+serpenttucker> I also appreciate the star wars stories that have NOTHING to do with the force
[2:45:38] <%VCRUZZO> God Jaesa!
[2:45:41] <Second_Omega> Sion: This is 10% pain, 20% pain, 15% concentrated power of pain, 5% pain, 50 % pain, and 100% reason to remember the pain.
[2:45:47] <+AsinPersuasion> you're actively punished in kotor2 for being grey
[2:45:49] <%DatAsuna> @startstoprepeat nah, gray inquisitor gets a specific darth title for it
[2:45:50] <+AsinPersuasion> apathy is death
[2:45:51] <amgoodball> Just joined is this the ending or start?
[2:45:54] <%Ashenik1> light later?
[2:45:55] <ralphfromdk> Lawfull evil
[2:46:03] <%Gruhunchously> @amgoodball Intermission
[2:46:07] <%MrMoonGoose> Sam Jackson
[2:46:08] <%DSD24> @amgoodball Almost ending they are taking a break
[2:46:09] <%Theycallmenerf> @amgoodball Break
[2:46:11] <amgoodball> Tyty
[2:46:16] <Joestar1890> Like a Sith Shonen Protagonist?
[2:46:16] <%Theycallmenerf> Ye
[2:46:18] <%MrMoonGoose> MACE WINDEW
[2:46:19] <time_axis> I view it as someone who is calm and rational, not emotional, serenity, not passion, but still doing "evil"
[2:46:25] <+evbites> anakin
[2:46:27] <%DappercatEsquire> but the middle way is booooooooooring
[2:46:32] <+ktothec99> Star Wars Legacy had 'Grey' Jedi who were almost Lawful Neutral soldiers
[2:46:34] <rubbishbinge> chaotic neutral
[2:46:40] <subjectg> You’re thinking chaotic good when you’re thinking lawful evil
[2:46:41] <%MrMoonGoose> YOU ARE DESCRIBING MACE WINDEW
[2:46:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Force Lighting for GOOD
[2:46:45] <%lotharrio> A reasonable monster.
[2:46:46] <Halospaz117> Still lightening-ing and choking everything
[2:46:46] <%VCRUZZO> SW is okay by comparison to some of the payoff you get towards the end of the Inqusitor tale
[2:46:48] <%DatAsuna> Well there is dark healing, but it's all alchemy shiht
[2:46:50] <%Ashenik1> so the end goal is evil by doing good things?
[2:46:53] <dinnydanny777> Kyle Katarn uses dark and light force powers
[2:46:55] <%krispen_wa> Is Light Side Sith that one Sith Lord who had a happy life and died surrounded by his family?
[2:47:01] <%lotharrio> Klingons
[2:47:06] <%Theycallmenerf> Smart Sith vs dumb murder only Sith
[2:47:18] <+Kyma1020> Lawful Evil instead of Chaotic Evil
[2:47:21] <%jillpilled> you wouldn't know that in Episode 9 LUL
[2:47:23] <aiutare47> Lawful evil
[2:47:26] <phatmac16> Balance is important for both sides
[2:47:29] <+SarcFa> Ehhh Swtor light sith are more Dooku than even Palpatine imho
[2:47:35] <%DatAsuna> odd that they gave the black guy that backstory
[2:47:37] <BurdRightsActivist> virgin yoda vs CHAD WINDU
[2:47:37] <+ktothec99> Cade Skywalker in Legacy was also super chaotic good and used dark side powers
[2:47:37] <gastherobots> Dark side Sith is fishmalk tier.
[2:47:38] <huskarl_zap> funny
[2:47:39] <%krispen_wa> Light Side Sith is just Cao Cao or Nobunaga
[2:47:46] <+AsinPersuasion> +
[2:47:49] <KrazeArcain> yay but plo-ku tho
[2:47:53] <%Theycallmenerf> Cade Skywalker > Ben Solo
[2:47:54] <%Ashenik1> hmmmmm the only black jedi supress the evil withn him
[2:47:55] <BurdRightsActivist> Fuck yeah LE
[2:47:57] <%wibbwobbler> yes, mace windu is known to use anger
[2:47:58] <dinnydanny777> Light Side Sith is Kreia
[2:47:58] <GarbageNirvana> You make sure the trains run on time
[2:47:59] <%DashXero> Lawful Evil: Best Evil
[2:48:01] <%VCRUZZO> Whats your goal dark sider? power! ...and? ...more power? *sigh*
[2:48:04] <%DappercatEsquire> authoritarian, more like
[2:48:04] <time_axis> also Light Side Sith Warrior does delve a bit into what Woolie said.
[2:48:05] <tranquilturnip> Selfish
[2:48:05] <%DatAsuna> I'd say the warrior is more about lawful/honor when light
[2:48:06] <Kirbachev> Kyle Katarn best grey jedi
[2:48:13] <phatmac16> Why is the black guy evil?
[2:48:14] <Djinnazz> the Mob.
[2:48:21] <+evbites> lex
[2:48:21] <Joestar1890> A scumbag who treats everyone with compassion and respect
[2:48:22] <%DashXero> Lawful Evil monks are awesome.
[2:48:23] <penitentpentwitch> Kingpin?
[2:48:26] <Djinnazz> Melony
[2:48:29] <%Javaa01> Two-Face?
[2:48:29] <+AsinPersuasion> two face
[2:48:30] <%MrMoonGoose> Never thought about Mace being the one with 'natural darkside tendencies'
[2:48:31] <jorniev> they finished already !?
[2:48:34] <%DatAsuna> The inquisitor is more about change and reform, while still being imperial.
[2:48:35] <AntifaCatboy> Bizarro Superman
[2:48:36] <%jillpilled> Riddler
[2:48:36] <GHouseduivel> Mr. Freeze?
[2:48:39] <%DappercatEsquire> @jorniev taking a break
[2:48:39] <dinnydanny777> Financial Evil should be it's own category
[2:48:39] <%lotharrio> Mr. Freeze
[2:48:39] <%Pillagius> Perfect option for "Good Sith" maybe Kiryu Kazama? He's Yakuza but he's good
[2:48:40] <KaiserMario> Ra's Al Ghul
[2:48:40] <ColbyBryant> chatScars chatScars
[2:48:44] <vaderxyz1970> Rajal Gol
[2:48:45] <Kirbachev> @DashXero Like that Dwarf dude in NWN1, he was awesome. The Order of the Long Death.
[2:48:46] <ashenjuan25> I still think if done right there could be a light side sith order and a dark side Jedi order
[2:48:48] <jorniev> thank god
[2:48:49] <memejima> GoTo
[2:48:51] <xiccy> Ra's Al Ghul
[2:48:54] <ObsidianDragon86> mr freeze might be chaotic neutral?
[2:48:55] <%DashXero> @Kirbachev HELL YEAH!
[2:49:07] <%DatAsuna> dokapon pockets gets crushed
[2:49:09] <+AsinPersuasion> fanny pack ez
[2:49:13] <Joestar1890> @Pillagius That's actually a good description of light side Sith Warrior
[2:49:17] <dinnydanny777> Is Plagueis Light Side Sith? Prolonging life sounds pretty light side
[2:49:18] <%MrMoonGoose> Fanny wins
[2:49:18] <huskarl_zap> Kotor 2 protag is outta control no matter what
[2:49:19] <gastherobots> There are NPCs in the game who would probably be light side Sith who totally complain about some other characters for being just crazy assholes who make things worse for everyone.
[2:49:20] <Kirbachev> @DashXero I KNEW you were thinking of him LUL Lawful Evil monks are pretty rare, but they're always cool as shit
[2:49:20] <illusivediz> Ra’s aAl Gaul
[2:49:26] <Daxalog> Dokapon Pockets could win if she used strike. But would never use it.
[2:49:31] <ThousandDogs> am I coming in at the end of the stream
[2:49:32] <%Ashenik1> pockets will just use her money to overwhelm fanny
[2:49:32] <jorniev> WHENS SHEPARD !?
[2:49:36] <$TheFabledAble> mamamamoney money
[2:49:46] <keiji_maede> Mr. Iceman, lol! mr. freeze just wants his wife back
[2:49:48] <%DashXero> @Kirbachev The only reason I never used him much was because I was playing as a Lawful Evil monk.
[2:49:52] <DaBigVitus> how the hell is a fanny pack the opposite of a pocket anyway?
[2:49:52] <%Gruhunchously> KOTOR 2 made Pockets so much cooler than she was in KOTOR 1
[2:49:53] <tranquilturnip> KOTOR 2: the search for pockets
[2:49:54] <%DatAsuna> Well not really
[2:49:58] <%lotharrio> But Fann ended up like 10 levels higher. Number go big.
[2:50:00] <FiendishlyInventive> Not a chance.
[2:50:03] <%DatAsuna> The revan stuff is just a very interesting subplot
[2:50:04] <%VCRUZZO> ez
[2:50:05] <%Gruhunchously> NO FORCE FOR YOU
[2:50:09] <%DatAsuna> Kotor 2 is about your wound
[2:50:17] <Kirbachev> @DashXero I was playing Lawful Neutral Monk, so yeah. Similar reasons I didn't take him much.
[2:50:18] <%DashXero> @Kirbachev Lawful Evil in Hordes of the Underdark gives you an awesome ending.
[2:50:19] <%VCRUZZO> lol
[2:50:19] <%krispen_wa> Fann is probably weaker lore-wise. But there's so much cooler though
[2:50:20] <Karhax> Pockets don't need the force
[2:50:20] <%Gruhunchously> hmmmmm?
[2:50:25] <+evbites> satchel
[2:50:27] <dinnydanny777> Oh no here comes the art

[2:50:37] <308caliber> Revan and Exile kids
[2:50:40] <+therabbles> what's in the pockets? A fanny pack
[2:50:40] <$Invlux> PocketPack PogChamp
[2:50:41] <+Urgoslav> Kreia is making a better Pockets. More comfortable, more storage, doesn't need the pants that surrounds her.
[2:50:42] <%lotharrio> Wool-cest?
[2:50:44] <jorniev> Kotor 2 is about overcoming trauma?
[2:50:46] <Kirbachev> @DashXero Oh, I know. I played HotD a LOT. The sheer number of endings was fuckin' impressive.
[2:50:50] <+Grayhammatter> PocketPack is strong
[2:50:53] <memejima> To make: Coat Pocket
[2:50:54] <dinnydanny777> By tomorrow I bet there will be nude art

[2:51:33] <%krispen_wa> Senator Kreia Armstrong
[2:51:36] <Kirbachev> @DashXero cvR
[2:51:38] <%Ashenik1> she wants to kill DISNEY
[2:51:40] <ashenjuan25> Fuuuck you right wools
[2:51:41] <%DappercatEsquire> fuck star wars
[2:51:41] <subjectg> Kreia essentially wants to end Star Wars so there can be peace
[2:51:42] <%Javaa01> Considering his other works, yeah, that's not a stretch
[2:51:49] <time_axis> Maybe Kreia came to our galaxy
[2:51:57] <+LilyaFatal> A long time ago
[2:51:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:51:58] <Halospaz117> I absolutely believe Avellone intends that at least a bit
[2:52:02] <+TheGamingPilgrimage> Such a shame SWOTR destroyed this possibility
[2:52:06] <+therabbles> MODERN DAAAAY
[2:52:11] <GHouseduivel> Stop that woolie
[2:52:11] <%Chatterbox1991> "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"

[2:52:22] <Halospaz117> And Chewbacca became Bigfoot
[2:52:22] <+Giggalith> The Ark was a sith artifact
[2:52:23] <%DatAsuna> @TheGamingPilgrimage be fair, kotor 2 swerved away from that, not swtor
[2:52:24] <%VCRUZZO> did my genocide create a new universe
[2:52:37] <+Freeborg1997> Did you finish the game? I just got here.
[2:52:38] <%MrMoonGoose> Indiana Jones recovers a Sith Holocron.....

[2:52:43] <subjectg> @giggalith *forerunner Kappa
[2:52:44] <%jepupu> The text bits made me cry.
[2:52:44] <liljojofett> ECHOES
[2:52:48] <+JustToWatch> ok but C3PO and R@ shoe up as glyphs in Indiana Jones, so this is actually canon
[2:52:51] <BurdRightsActivist> JERMA BATTLE MUSIC PogChamp
[2:52:51] <308caliber> Lost Odyssey Kreygasm
[2:52:52] <%DatAsuna> @Freeborg23 just breaking for lunch
[2:52:56] <+ZoltanBMagnus> the side stories ARE THE BEST in lost odyssey
[2:53:00] <gastherobots> What about a story about someone who's super successful and has everything, who then finds out their life was part of a prophecy and goes nuts because nothing they've every done was actually their skill but just "How it was meant to be"
[2:53:00] <%Irridium> It's BC Xbone grab that shit
[2:53:02] <$Fortunato5678> So Woolie guides V's shoulders in a Lost Odyssey playthough then?
[2:53:02] <phatmac16> Mass effect when?!
[2:53:05] <+BubbaRands> music is okay
[2:53:10] <+Freeborg1997> @DatAsuna Woah, taking them a while to beat Malachor.
[2:53:12] <time_axis> so Elder Scrolls
[2:53:13] <%BisoromiBear> soul crushing lore
[2:53:15] <%Ashenik1> Nazi Germany discovers Sith Holocron
[2:53:16] <available_line> EAT AND CONTINUE NotLikeThis
[2:53:17] <phatmac16> It’s overrated
[2:53:22] <gastherobots> The prophecy does nothing but good for them but they still hate it because it's controlling.
[2:53:32] <time_axis> or more like Nier
[2:53:34] <%kyh9> What game?
[2:53:36] <%krispen_wa> Isn't that just PLanescape: Torment
[2:53:43] <ShoggothLord> @gastherobots You're describing Alan Moore's version of Harry Potter in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comics
[2:53:44] <%DashXero> Planescape Torment?
[2:53:48] <%VCRUZZO> we talking Lost Oddesey?
[2:53:50] <Kirbachev> This format sounded terrible to me, but the writing for the short stories was legit great.
[2:53:51] <%kyh9> Oh, Lost Odyssey
[2:53:51] <%VCRUZZO> oh nvm
[2:53:54] <BurdRightsActivist> @Ashenik1 monkaS
[2:53:57] <%krispen_wa> ahh
[2:54:10] <gastherobots> @ShoggothLord Oh shit nice. I've heard only good things about that, need to give it a read finally.
[2:54:14] <%DatAsuna> It's dumb
[2:54:16] <%DatAsuna> better off cut
[2:54:16] <jorniev> woaaah
[2:54:18] <Kirbachev> "The galaxy will always need a betrayer."
[2:54:21] <%Gruhunchously> She also has a dark side outfit
[2:54:21] <Halospaz117> I've heard that before
[2:54:21] <%krispen_wa> Atris as the final boss would have sucked
[2:54:22] <Kirbachev> Yeah, it is.
[2:54:24] <%DatAsuna> THe line isn't cut
[2:54:26] <%VCRUZZO> it is
[2:54:26] <%DemonOfSalt> There is at least a Darth Atris robe.
[2:54:27] <%DatAsuna> it refers to cut content
[2:54:32] <FoolproofDread> It's actually really not great.
[2:54:33] <%Irridium> the line was always there yeah
[2:54:36] <%tuesti> yeah evil Atris
[2:54:39] <Pechugaman> GO GET FOOD
[2:54:39] <dinnydanny777> We should have left Kreia on Korriban really
[2:54:42] <phatmac16> Line was always there
[2:54:45] <StarlitStunner> Party Member Atris
[2:54:46] <%DatAsuna> The atris traya thing was best left alone
[2:54:49] <surik_at> a bit about Mass Shadows - it's something that massive objects like stars planets or black holes cast onto hyperspace. that's why you need hyperlanes and can't travel in any random direction @WoolieVersus
[2:54:50] <zeow31> it's in the vanilla but it's a hint to attris becoming traya
[2:54:58] <%DatAsuna> oof
[2:54:59] <%Gruhunchously> Eeesh
[2:54:59] <%VCRUZZO> damn
[2:55:00] <gastherobots> Fuk
[2:55:02] <GHouseduivel> God damn dawg
[2:55:07] <%MrMoonGoose> Darth Atrius is a different guy
[2:55:09] <BurdRightsActivist> TOO ANGRY TO DIE?
[2:55:13] <%krispen_wa> @WoolieVersus In the Strategy guide for KOTOR II, they STILL have a picture of Evil Atris as the final boss
[2:55:13] <%DashXero> Yeesh.
[2:55:16] <+ktothec99> Watch out man. Whiplash can start huting the next day
[2:55:21] <phatmac16> Go to the doctor
[2:55:23] <%BisoromiBear> gottem
[2:55:30] <time_axis> @surik_at So basically it is weaponizing hyperspace in the same way as the light speed kamikaze, way before that movie came out?
[2:55:36] <FoolproofDread> Glad to hear. Y'know the only minor injury part.
[2:55:37] <Halospaz117> Honestly, smart approach
[2:55:40] <%DatAsuna> Same basically
[2:56:12] <%VCRUZZO> I read alot of those jedi academy books as a kid
[2:56:15] <dinnydanny777> Prequels are better than the Sequels
[2:56:23] <zocano> Ya being able to convince Kreia to change her mind kinda... defeats the point
[2:56:23] <%Gruhunchously> Agreed
[2:56:28] <zocano> Makes for a worse character
[2:56:36] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly, Star Wars would probably be an interesting TV Series as an Anthology.
[2:56:53] <%krispen_wa> Everything was building up to Kreia as the final boss, so having it depend on your alignment wouldn't work
[2:56:54] <+miyoles> how do you guys like the use of Lore in Star wars: Jedi fallen order?
[2:56:56] <%VCRUZZO> yeah
[2:57:00] <%wibbwobbler> too bad disney threw out all of the eu stuff, good stories in there
[2:57:09] <surik_at> @time_axis sort of. i guess it's just much more devastating precursor to Trawn's Interdictor SDs
[2:57:13] <%Ashenik1> @dinnydanny777 naaaah, the prequals memes are good and The Clone Wars.
[2:57:17] <R3c0n31> The Dark Dark Vader that exists only in comics and video games
[2:57:17] <%Gruhunchously> Noooooooooo
[2:57:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[2:57:19] <prime_name> GIFLS
[2:57:20] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[2:57:22] <+evbites> cowards
[2:57:22] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[2:57:22] <%VCRUZZO> wow
[2:57:23] <308caliber> oh no WutFace
[2:57:24] <Halospaz117> OH GOD, WHERE'S THE BLEACH
[2:57:24] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:57:26] <%Space_Pagan> GMILF
[2:57:27] <StarlitStunner> finoWHY
[2:57:28] <GHouseduivel> oh no LUL
[2:57:28] <phatmac16> Too bad Disney hates the OG stuff
[2:57:29] <branflakes42069> SeemsGood
[2:57:30] <time_axis> if you REALLY want to
[2:57:30] <zeow31> @wibbwobbler Lot of awful stories in the EU too sadly
[2:57:30] <%Zayasu> Kreygasm
[2:57:35] <Divryne> NOOO.
[2:57:40] <GHouseduivel> That's his will in his pants Kreygasm
[2:57:41] <Halospaz117> I WOULD LIKE TO BE MALACHOR'D NOW
[2:57:45] <BurdRightsActivist> :0
[2:57:46] <illusivediz> NOOOOOO
[2:57:48] <dinnydanny777> @ashenik1 I think the prequels are better than the sequels but whatever
[2:58:05] <penitentpentwitch> "You're too late! I'm already Kreia's Baby Daddy!" Sion proceeds to explode in anger.
[2:58:08] <gastherobots> Something hit me recently. In the EU Jacen Solo falls to the darkside so easily in part because of Luke being too trusting and forgiving even when people are screaming at him about Jacen. And if they're took "Han and Leia's" son goes to the dark side plot from the EU, why didn't they also take the much more in character failing of Luke?
[2:58:09] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia says as such
[2:58:10] <%DatAsuna> the video will somewhat hint at it too
[2:58:13] <%wibbwobbler> @zeow31 true
[2:58:27] <%DatAsuna> Drebins
[2:58:32] <tattleworm> hell yeah
[2:58:33] <%Gruhunchously> We don't really know who Nihilus was before he became what he was.
[2:58:40] <Doodle_Taco> Dreb
[2:58:40] <308caliber> Drebin
[2:58:40] <dinnydanny777> And then the camera panned up their butts
[2:58:41] <tattleworm> and you can photograph him in his underwear
[2:58:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Drebin
[2:58:44] <%Ashenik1> @dinnydanny777 man when was the last time you them? These are such a bad movies. TFA and TLJ are good movies ;d
[2:58:46] <%Irridium> Drebin
[2:58:46] <%alpacasintophats> Drebin
[2:58:48] <%VCRUZZO> drebin
[2:58:49] <%DashXero> How could you forget Drebin?!
[2:58:53] <BurdRightsActivist> Nihilus idol dancing? PogChamp
[2:58:56] <%lotharrio> I hated that. I wanted the codec info dumps BEFORE the fight.
[2:58:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> And Snake goes "I don't fucking care."
[2:59:04] <%jillpilled> Nihlus Idolmaster PogChamp
[2:59:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[2:59:10] <dinnydanny777> @ashenik1 I really disagree, I find the first two better than the Force Awakens
[2:59:10] <time_axis> nihilus doing sexy poses for the camera
[2:59:15] <%DatAsuna> and also a lot of things they did record and decided not to
[2:59:18] <tranquilturnip> alternatively, the guy named "Darth Nothing" never gets a name and that feels appropriate
[2:59:22] <illusivediz> Drebin
[2:59:24] <zeow31> @gastherobots I feel like they wanted to show a luke under pressure since he alone rebuilt the jedi order... could've been better but I liked the idea
[2:59:27] <%Pillagius> Yeah, and the Nihlus dancing to j-pop would be the perfect easter egg
[2:59:36] <%krispen_wa> Jacen was weird.
[2:59:43] <%DatAsuna> Jaina ws great
[2:59:44] <%alpacasintophats> with the most anime of j-pop music possible
[2:59:46] <%Gruhunchously> Jacen Solo=proto-Kylo Ren
[2:59:47] <Pechugaman> Jacen was great
[2:59:52] <penitentpentwitch> LUNCH STARTING YEAH!
[2:59:53] <%Ashenik1> @dinnydanny777 I have to ask when was the last time you saw them?
[2:59:56] <%krispen_wa> GAME OVER YEEEEEAAAAH
