[0:02:39] <@Solidus_113> mods on game banana already FIRE
[0:02:43] <+Shishi1205> that 2s
[0:02:45] <@Menitta> It must be the towers I live near but it took maybe 10 minutes to get into the main menu in Strive
[0:02:52] <FrostedZaibatsu> Heard that Strive players numbers are reaching launch numbers
[0:02:54] <@Solidus_113> Akuma baiken, DMC3 Vergil
[0:03:02] <@Solidus_113> no jacket
[0:03:06] <TheQuadrupleS> She's got some wild shit
[0:03:12] <JayEarly> baiken without the eyepatch
[0:03:15] <%Juriasu> drop the mat on em
[0:03:17] <metabot64> I havent played baiken since accent.  She doesn't have the guard cancel stuff anymore right?
[0:03:17] <@Menitta> Vergil? woolieSHOOK
[0:03:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Baiken with two eye patches?
[0:03:30] <@Solidus_113> just a recolour

[0:03:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> ropes are fun
[0:04:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and you can do a lot of dirty things TO HER with the rope LUL
[0:04:10] <NotHereToStream> ropes are a double edge sword
[0:04:14] <Evendrag> rope defines new baiken
[0:04:25] <leith_aziz> Combo Maker addition is so fun. Made me discover a lot of fun tech
[0:04:26] <Evendrag> and makes her new and interesting in a different way
[0:04:28] <temzzii> Im pretty sure you can steal someones soul with the rope
[0:04:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> tie yourself to me i dare you
[0:04:37] <+Shishi1205> there's a nago baiken too

[0:04:57] <Evendrag> @leith_aziz I spent 2 hours on combomaker today, alot of fun indeed
[0:05:03] <+Jiggisnipe> nice LUL
[0:05:03] <TurkinaKeshik> HPB into HPB is the best combo.

[0:06:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Baiken: "I have tethered us together." Potemkin: "You have tethered us TOGETHER."
[0:06:17] <haisho> so you're telling me there's Megafist kendama
[0:06:21] <TheQuadrupleS> I saw a 311 damage Sol combo with the rope lmao
[0:06:29] <@Solidus_113> the way to fix a lot of the weird stuff it just make the tether break after 2 hits or something
[0:06:31] <+the22cstomp> doing tether against goldlewis is also a death sentence
[0:06:32] <leith_aziz> @TheQuadrupleS That's usual for Sol pickyEZ
[0:06:49] <+CryptusMaximus> That said, rope has a safe Tatami TK jump setup that you WILL have to block if she gets throw.
[0:06:49] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 Nah, keep it pickyAYAYA

[0:08:12] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:08:19] <+DannySteele> the only thing thats a shame about baiken is her theme doesn't get going nearly fast enough in game
[0:08:24] <leith_aziz> Strive modding is awesome. A lot of stuff there
[0:08:32] <@Menitta> oooh I gotta try that

[0:11:04] <+DannySteele> arcsys really said "DO COMBO"
[0:11:06] <%townzzzzz> do combo
[0:11:23] <leith_aziz> The game als ohas a scary amount of terms we in the FGC use. TODs, Setplay, etc
[0:11:31] <NotHereToStream> im fine with mission mode as long it teaches me some basic link, i just build upon that in training mode
[0:11:31] <leith_aziz> *also has a scary
[0:11:33] <+Mrbaconator> baiken has sheer unrivaled drip

[0:12:41] <@Menitta> I feel like this has needed to exist in games for decades
[0:12:44] <+Mrbaconator> this feature is sexy
[0:12:50] <+robotman37> that's actually cool
[0:12:51] <leith_aziz> Kudos, Arcsys cohhGG
[0:12:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> make some connections
[0:12:56] <+TopTieramisu> @Menitta for real. this should be the standard for all fighting games
[0:13:07] <munkey_time> such a genius idea
[0:13:16] <%Volvo4Loyf> Volvo4Loyf is gifting 3 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 3 in the channel! 
[0:13:17] <%Volvo4Loyf> Volvo4Loyf gifted a Tier 1 sub to Funkyfjord! 
[0:13:17] <%Volvo4Loyf> Volvo4Loyf gifted a Tier 1 sub to thespookiestskeleton! 
[0:13:17] <%Volvo4Loyf> Volvo4Loyf gifted a Tier 1 sub to Explodincatz! 
[0:13:26] <%jinking79> i hate the recipe that has u manual move the character to position
[0:13:27] <JayEarly> more fighting games should have community teaching resources in the game
[0:13:28] <+TopTieramisu> no more needing to go to discords for tech
[0:13:33] <Rickbane> nice if the combo community give viable combo options for lower skilled players to do something
[0:13:46] <@Menitta> Thats something I need to work on. I need to know what to do exactly on counter hit with characters because I am SHIT at figuring that out
[0:13:59] <@Menitta> This helps a lot
[0:14:00] <leith_aziz> The only issue is that commenting is kinda limited. So it's hard to either describe a techs use in detail or stuff like needing to Kara cancel some combos with Sol
[0:14:02] <NotHereToStream> japanese name? must be good
[0:14:15] <T_Sasquatch> Oh wow this is insane
[0:14:19] <+Superbro64> 1.5k people is not a small amount of lab monsters
[0:14:21] <leith_aziz> I just did "S > Kara/Dash cancell > DP" as comment
[0:14:30] <+Mrbaconator> tatami will eat a lot of projectiles including leos heavy projectile
[0:14:34] <%SirGO0SE> and its pretty snappy too, i expected it to be clunkier/slower
[0:14:34] <@Menitta> oooh man her theme is incredible
[0:14:36] <gryffinp> It would be really nice if there was a text string copy and paste import/export
[0:14:37] <+Mrbaconator> it won't eat batonejo
[0:14:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> @NotHereToStream Any dumb person can learn japanese, like me
[0:14:42] <+whimsipop> i don't know shit about fighting games but this is soooo pretty
[0:14:44] <leith_aziz> It's more than combos FYI, even tech, punishes and Setplay
[0:14:52] <+projectmanatees> imagine if you had this and the combo babies timing thing banyaPog
[0:14:54] <leith_aziz> They worked on this a lot, you can tell
[0:14:54] <+Mrbaconator> @NotHereToStream oh hey im also learning japanese
[0:15:07] <+Shishi1205> the fact that setplay is an option ingmae lmao

[0:17:39] <+Mrbaconator> landing parry makes me fucking nut
[0:17:43] <+Shishi1205> @cartakus gear attack
[0:17:49] <JayEarly> did Arcsys release official lyrics for the dlc music?
[0:17:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> One thing i dislike about combo VIDEOS is having to rewind it SO many times
[0:17:52] <%SirGO0SE> @TopTieramisu i saw their stream for the first time last week and could not for the life of me figure out why they were in my follows but i enjoyed it LUL
[0:17:57] <%slayabee> Close S charged D works
[0:17:57] <leith_aziz> @cartakus An attack by Gears killed her family and massively injured her

[0:18:05] <+CryptusMaximus> I love how parry blows up fake ass blockstrings. It even makes Nago players think.
[0:18:08] <cartakus> oof
[0:18:26] <+Gnrt> have you guys seen the double hpb combo on baiken with tether?
[0:18:27] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly I dont think it's Arcsys that usually does that. I always check on another channel for that cohhHmm
[0:18:32] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu lance is famous on youtube for modding and datamining fromsoft games. you might know him as the guy who made the 60 fps mod of bloodborne

[0:19:21] <leith_aziz> The hair has a lot of resemblance to the nine-tailed fox
[0:19:24] <%SirGO0SE> the purple/lavender one is so good
[0:19:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> bigger boobs bigger hair
[0:19:28] <huskarl_zap> they're talking about elden ring
[0:19:28] <DSD24> That sounds nice
[0:19:34] <+Mrbaconator> oh fair
[0:19:34] <leith_aziz> I forgot the animal's name
[0:19:35] <%Volvo4Loyf> Cheer500 Hey woolz! You got me into fighting games a decade ago and I'm still fucken here, thanks for keeping it real woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:19:35] <Halospaz117> s'all good
[0:19:41] <+TopTieramisu> baiken has a lot of good alt colors
[0:19:45] <JayEarly> in game her boobs don‚Äôt look bigger than xrd
[0:19:51] <orpleborple> isn't colour 2 a reference to the ps1 gg?
[0:19:51] <NotHereToStream> they might be character specific?
[0:20:01] <leith_aziz> @Mrbaconator So? That's their choice, dummy cohhFail
[0:20:05] <Halospaz117> Yeah I think her splash art just sort of emphazized em
[0:20:18] <+DannySteele> gotta use gun there I think
[0:20:25] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think baiken is any bigger than she was in xrd
[0:20:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> @JayEarly i ripped both models. Theyre massive
[0:20:30] <thepardack> gotta pull out the GUN
[0:20:36] <Halospaz117> If anything I think her HAIR got bigger
[0:20:44] <+Shishi1205> @TopTieramisu her hair is longer
[0:20:45] <NotHereToStream> kabari-5S-charged 5D-5S-6HS-tatami works
[0:20:49] <leith_aziz> Her hair did get bigger
[0:20:54] <JayEarly> @frostedzaibatsu yeah but are they different?
[0:21:01] <+TopTieramisu> well, that's not the size i was talking about LUL
[0:21:02] <leith_aziz> It looks simillar to teh nine-tailed fox
[0:21:02] <%SirGO0SE> thats a good damage
[0:21:04] <%slayabee> c.S charged D after tether launches and pulls back iirc
[0:21:10] <Raven_In_A_Tree> her hair is literally like 2 times bigger compared to xrd
[0:21:36] <FrostedZaibatsu> @JayEarly yes, thats what im saying
[0:21:39] <thomasvalentine31> Goodness her pimp stride is so great
[0:21:40] <+CryptusMaximus> Baiken stole Leo's shampoo from Xrd
[0:21:44] <leith_aziz> cohhJam cohhJam cohhJam
[0:21:48] <+TopTieramisu> i do kinda wish strive was titled xrth
[0:21:54] <cartakus> Her pose reminds me of the half hand guy from vagabond
[0:21:57] <Halospaz117> Baiken didn't visit a single barber between Xrd and Strive
[0:22:03] <DSD24> I really like how fluffy her hair looks
[0:22:11] <thepardack> @TopTieramisu you're so fuckin right
[0:22:24] <JayEarly> Baiken hasn‚Äôt seen a barber for the whole series timeline
[0:22:32] <user_naim> I love the design decision of ‚ÄùBigger hair, bigger hat, bigger tits, bigger pecks‚Äù
[0:22:46] <DSD24> @user_naim Everyone got that look at Sol
[0:22:47] <thepardack> GG characters just keep gettin bigger
[0:22:48] <Halospaz117> Baiken hasn't seen a barber since Japan still existed
[0:22:49] <+Shishi1205> gun during dust is funny af
[0:22:57] <%townzzzzz> SHE HAS A GUN Kappa
[0:23:03] <@Menitta> you may have a brain...BUT I HAVE A GUN
[0:23:03] <Mach5Mike> "For the overdrive, she wields a GUN"
[0:23:07] <hamahiroyuki> hair almost super saiyan 3 tho. thank god she kept her eyebrows
[0:23:10] <%SirGO0SE> oh shit thats real?!
[0:23:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:23:11] <user_naim> @dsd24 yeah him too
[0:23:11] <+TopTieramisu> the real question is how much of her hair has a hitbox?
[0:23:14] <+TopTieramisu> hurtbox*
[0:23:18] <DSD24> Sol was pretty thin but still muscular in GG and now he's part Gorilla
[0:23:18] <leith_aziz> "F*CL YOUR BLACK TECH LAWS" pickyBang
[0:23:32] <leith_aziz> 3/4 of the DLC have guns cohhHmm
[0:23:38] <Mach5Mike> Yo that's sick
[0:23:44] <+BotanicMoney> Dope
[0:23:52] <thomasvalentine31> I'm sorry, Baiken can SUPER during the air chase transitions??
[0:24:05] <JayEarly> is a firework launcher black tech?
[0:24:05] <+Shishi1205> @thomasvalentine31 May too
[0:24:10] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 Sol looks better for me when he looks ripped. He should be a beefcake
[0:24:14] <stormhawk9891> @thomasvalentine31 Everyone with an air super can
[0:24:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Y must you suffer for dropped combos?
[0:24:22] <JayEarly> maybe it‚Äôs technically legal to own a firework gun
[0:24:25] <leith_aziz> So im fine with him getting thicker pickyAYAYA
[0:24:32] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder how much player retention baiken will have in this game compared to earlier entries?
[0:24:33] <thomasvalentine31> @stormhawk9891 Did not know that as i never saw that happen in clips. lol
[0:24:35] <user_naim> 5 character is redhead Jam with a shotgun
[0:24:36] <DSD24> @leith_aziz Oh for sure I like Sol being buff but I'm glad everyone is buff
[0:24:40] <+Shishi1205> I don't think Baiken cares about the law
[0:25:03] <leith_aziz> pickyTears pickyTears pickyTears
[0:25:08] <@Menitta> Her dub VA is also really good
[0:25:14] <leith_aziz> cohhBongos cohhJam cohhJam cohhJam cohhJam cohhBongos
[0:25:21] <Halospaz117> I did not expect Baiken to be southern but I kinda dig it
[0:25:26] <+TopTieramisu> but her original VA is absolutely amazing
[0:25:35] <JayEarly> baiken‚Äôs jD has always been the best
[0:25:41] <DSD24> Isn't Baiken Nico from DMC5?
[0:25:43] <%SirGO0SE> Louisianna Baiken took me but surprise but im here for it
[0:25:47] <leith_aziz> A southern accent is the english equivalent for a Kansai accent. So it's smart what they did
[0:25:47] <DSD24> English I mean
[0:25:52] <Jathspuh> oh god
[0:25:53] <+TopTieramisu> that gravely intensity just works so well
[0:25:53] <Halospaz117> @DSD24 Not as far as I know
[0:25:54] <%slayabee> Is anyone else getting screen tearing?
[0:25:59] <Raven_In_A_Tree> as a person who lives in the US southwest I despise her dumb accent
[0:26:00] <user_naim> that jp line read of tatami gaeshi is hype
[0:26:15] <+TopTieramisu> i like how she has two different intensity for tatami gaeshi
[0:26:15] <TopLeftCenter> You can also IAD back and tatami for an easy safejump
[0:26:20] <+CryptusMaximus> @Halospaz117 Samurai are kinda like earlier eastern Cowboys so it makes a weird kind of sense.
[0:26:23] <+TopTieramisu> intensities*
[0:26:25] <hamahiroyuki> wouldnt the technology of making bullet cartridges also lost? so at some point all black tech will be useless wouldnt?
[0:26:32] <JayEarly> I‚Äôve heard people say her VA is Bangalore‚Äôs from Apex not sure if accurate
[0:26:37] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Higher. I see a lot of people talking about finally being able to get the hang of Baiken and enjoying her a lot pickyCozy
[0:26:37] <+TopTieramisu> she's shooting fireworks
[0:26:39] <%Juriasu> doesn't the toss rope?
[0:26:53] <+Akizea> baikens English VA is Sylvanas from WoW
[0:26:55] <leith_aziz> Agreed
[0:26:58] <Halospaz117> Dub VA's name is Patty Mattson
[0:26:58] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu yeah, alpha countering is much less intuitive than a regular counter
[0:27:00] <@Menitta> I wanna try Jack O
[0:27:07] <@Menitta> I only bought the DLC last night lol
[0:27:10] <leith_aziz> EVen the presentation keeps getting better
[0:27:12] <leith_aziz> *Even
[0:27:18] <%SirGO0SE> they really are, and im happy Baiken is a lot easier to play than the other DLC
[0:27:20] <+Mrbaconator> landing the counter is the SICKEST SHIT
[0:27:22] <NotHereToStream> no projectile of course
[0:27:28] <+BotanicMoney> And supers
[0:27:29] <munkey_time> are there plans for how many characters were getting
[0:27:29] <+ausl0> parrying supers is hilarious
[0:27:41] <sappmaster> the ost and the gameplay have been on point
[0:27:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> she scary
[0:27:45] <leith_aziz> @munkey_time 5 for this season
[0:27:48] <Halospaz117> I saw someone parry a goddamn ride the lightning
[0:28:01] <leith_aziz> I have a feeling Strive at one point will put in most GG characters at one point
[0:28:05] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[0:28:06] <munkey_time> @munkey_time baiken was #4 right?
[0:28:13] <+RD_NX> Predictable!
[0:28:25] <+ManOfReason> Rope responsibly
[0:28:25] <%SirGO0SE> yeah I think the game will likely have a 3rd season pass if it continues to be as succesful as it is
[0:28:26] <leith_aziz> @munkey_time Yes
[0:28:28] <+TopTieramisu> i want to see giant cockpit mommy justice in strive
[0:28:29] <+Akizea> theres a rumor I've been hearing that this GG is gonna get closer to smash ultimate in terms of who's in it
[0:28:46] <munkey_time> @munkey_time and are there rumors for #5 yet or too soon?
[0:28:57] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @akizea absolutely not
[0:28:57] <+Bin_VV> This the first strive dlc to not have some special meter
[0:28:58] <leith_aziz> @Akizea The team talked about wanting to put everyone from GG to Strive at one point of possible
[0:29:05] <leith_aziz> That's likely what you're talkin about
[0:29:12] <@Menitta> I dont buy that. Guilty Gear isnt gonna add crossover characters
[0:29:20] <leith_aziz> @munkey_time Yes, but I prefer not leaking
[0:29:21] <Halospaz117> As long as I get my Johnny and Slayer, I'm happy
[0:29:24] <user_naim> oh that‚Äôs fun
[0:29:29] <NotHereToStream> testament back in strive, thats gonna be hell
[0:29:31] <+TopTieramisu> @Akizea can't wait to play as solid snake vs banjo kazooie in strive
[0:29:38] <+Akizea> @leith_aziz thatd be so sick but also so scary cause like.....that means testament, justice and kliff
[0:29:40] <@Menitta> I desperately want Johnny
[0:29:48] <+R0kushi> I mean, goldlewis meter is automatic, so its not something that important on his gameplan, just see where its at
[0:29:50] <leith_aziz> If GG ever crosses over, my 1st pick will always be DMC
[0:29:52] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I doubt we even get every gg character like kliff
[0:29:53] <Halospaz117> Justice vs Jack'O would be fuckin weird
[0:29:56] <mothdude> @munkey_time The Baiken rumor had number 5 in there, so it's there if you want to find it.
[0:30:03] <+TopTieramisu> put lady in strive
[0:30:21] <leith_aziz> @Akizea Keep Kliff dead. We dont need him cohhSus
[0:30:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1486261185653657607?t=TY33I0sz3hRhHS78nrxA2g&s=19
[0:30:23] <+TopTieramisu> nero would also be dope
[0:30:30] <leith_aziz> YEP. This works
[0:30:32] <@Menitta> LMAO
[0:30:39] <NotHereToStream> charged dust
[0:30:42] <+Akizea> kliff as a character is like cool, but fighting against him is so fucking wack lol
[0:30:49] <Halospaz117> I mean Kliff was still dead in Accent Core, all his story appearences were in teh past
[0:30:57] <NotHereToStream> charged dust after the tether into c.S works
[0:30:59] <Halospaz117> oh for fucks sake did I just spell teh?
[0:31:05] <+ar4ndomblackguy> jump over for some crossup crazy stuff?
[0:31:09] <Halospaz117> fuckin fast fingers
[0:31:10] <%slayabee> charged dust in combo is the move
[0:31:18] <+ar4ndomblackguy> after charged dust
[0:31:19] <%kinetikpaws> kinetikpaws subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 
[0:31:23] <leith_aziz> @Akizea I dont know. I actually find everyone in GG cool, but Kliff to me always felt the most bland. Allthough I am speaking as a lorehead cohhNotes
[0:31:37] <+Bin_VV> What's crazy about tether is that you're still connected even if you burst
[0:31:39] <T_Doobie> I guess charged dust could be more useful for tatami setups, since the mat covers the animation
[0:31:57] <user_naim> make that council dude playable
[0:32:17] <leith_aziz> @Halospaz117 And that's how I prefer them doing it if they wanna bring someone back. Keep him flashbacks only, no need for justification. Looking at you Tekken if you bring Heihachi back cohhSus
[0:32:21] <DSD24> Purple Baiken nice
[0:32:23] <user_naim> and just have him be w
[0:32:30] <DSD24> Purple is the best color after all
[0:32:31] <user_naim> q*
[0:32:32] <%kinetikpaws> good color choice
[0:32:40] <+Akizea> @leith_aziz lol I'm a sucker for 'cool old man' character so much so that I made one of my.main npc's a Kliff refrence as well as Soria from granblue and Hitman from DFO
[0:32:41] <@Menitta> oooh thats a good intro
[0:32:41] <leith_aziz> cohhPog cohhPog cohhPog
[0:32:45] <guudmagik> bae-cen Kreygasm
[0:32:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> her match end is AMAZING
[0:32:50] <leith_aziz> F'cking amazing inro
[0:32:51] <+TopTieramisu> this opening is so good
[0:32:52] <DSD24> Wish I knew what he was saying
[0:32:55] <%Juriasu> the grass on the new your stage is hilarious to me
[0:32:56] <+TopTieramisu> intro*
[0:32:58] <%polothegreatest> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:32:59] <Mach5Mike> I can't believe they made her Xrd intro and win screens even better
[0:33:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> There's a mod that makes the intro the samurai jack intro
[0:33:05] <@Menitta> OH ITS NOT THERE
[0:33:06] <+Bin_VV> Yo everything about this character is just so damn cool
[0:33:10] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, that's a great alt color for baiken
[0:33:10] <Halospaz117> Aw fuck I can't read the subs
[0:33:17] <leith_aziz> Baiken prefers to BLAME the Beasts doodOK
[0:33:20] <Raven_In_A_Tree> what's happy chaos do in her intro
[0:33:22] <+TopTieramisu> that's seriously really good
[0:33:50] <NotHereToStream> i better see some parries
[0:33:55] <+TopTieramisu> LMAO
[0:33:57] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree Not much. They have no unique interaction. Probably saving it for the next story and dont wanna spoil non-canon stuff
[0:33:57] <%kinetikpaws> BOOM
[0:33:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:33:58] <%Juriasu> GUN
[0:33:58] <+R0kushi> GUN

[0:34:07] <thepardack> BABOOM
[0:34:11] <atomicxdj> and for her neutral attack: GUN
[0:34:13] <+TopTieramisu> this is exhibit A of why gun > sword
[0:34:15] <leith_aziz> pickyBang pickyBang pickyBang
[0:34:18] <leith_aziz> So Raw
[0:34:25] <+ar4ndomblackguy> atpLaw
[0:34:30] <leith_aziz> Reminder that 3/4 of the DLC pack firepower
[0:34:36] <Raven_In_A_Tree> @leith_aziz no I mean like where does he appear? he usually walks up behind people
[0:34:46] <leith_aziz> Trying to tell us something Arcsys? cohhHmm
[0:34:54] <T_Doobie> @leith_aziz give jack-o a gun crikIQ
[0:34:58] <%Juriasu> can two baikens tether each other at the same time?
[0:35:01] <Halospaz117> I feel fucking feral when I play Baiken and I love it
[0:35:08] <leith_aziz> @Juriasu I think so
[0:35:16] <kotl7> the camera is a bit big I feel, Baiken's so short we can barely see when they're in the center of the screen
[0:35:18] <+TopTieramisu> there can be two tethers, yes
[0:35:22] <+Akizea> God tatami gaeshi is voiced SO well now
[0:35:32] <%mr_sups> That Counter does SO Much damage
[0:35:34] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Sol can turn the Outrage into a gun. Give it to her, Sol pickySmug
[0:35:44] <DSD24> Yeah how tall is Baiken? 5'6?
[0:36:00] <leith_aziz> Baiken is one of teh shortest characters in GG. I think May is taller
[0:36:11] <+TopTieramisu> 5'6" would be pretty average height
[0:36:11] <%polothegreatest> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:36:26] <JayEarly> The kanji on Baiken‚Äôs super looks like FUCK LUL
[0:36:34] <+R0kushi> lmao
[0:36:36] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu I went with that height cause a lot of characters in GG are pretty tall already
[0:36:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ready to meet dechi birb
[0:36:47] <DSD24> Also she is crouching in her neutral
[0:36:51] <T_Doobie> her profile lists her at 5'4"
[0:36:54] <leith_aziz> Them not needing to transition smoothly from ingame models to cutscene models lets the get away with so much more in terms of animation and presentation since they just cut to black
[0:36:54] <user_naim> @jayearly the duality of man: GUN and FUCK
[0:36:56] <T_Doobie> full-on gremlin
[0:36:58] <DSD24> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Beni Enma would like Baiken
[0:37:00] <leith_aziz> PARRY THIS YOU CASUAL
[0:37:12] <Raven_In_A_Tree> says online shes 5'4
[0:37:16] <Halospaz117> With all the guns characters are getting, if Elphelt gets in she's gonna need like an RPG to compensate
[0:37:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @DSD24 they'd spar all day
[0:37:21] <+TopTieramisu> 5'4" is the definition of average height for women
[0:37:23] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 7 month streak! love how the Baiken mirror talk is "I like your eye' and the other is 'I like my eye too.'
[0:37:27] <leith_aziz> @Halospaz117 She DOES have an RPG as a super
[0:37:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:38:08] <leith_aziz> In B4 Slayer gets a Gun pickyStare

[0:38:37] <+ar4ndomblackguy> diuble tethered combos Pogchamp
[0:38:38] <Halospaz117> Ok Slayer getting a gun would be too much, my boy punches cuz its fun
[0:38:45] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree What's that in cm please?
[0:38:45] <grimeything> "only 6'"
[0:38:58] <+Akizea> yeah now it'd a super tho. that's why people are freaking out like "Holy shit they gave baike a gun"
[0:39:00] <+TopTieramisu> in japanese media, over 6' is an attack on titan scaled person
[0:39:03] <leith_aziz> @Halospaz117 Yeah, shooting would be boring for Slayer
[0:39:07] <Mach5Mike> Kurosawa mode engaged
[0:39:09] <leith_aziz> Amazing Outro
[0:39:15] <DSD24> Oh yeah height is silly
[0:39:19] <+R0kushi> its the insta kill place too
[0:39:31] <leith_aziz> This is some of the best 3D anime presentation I've seen in the indusrty
[0:39:32] <%kinetikpaws> this makes me wanna learn my shamisen today

[0:40:58] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Leo is 6'5
[0:41:10] <Raven_In_A_Tree> and Nago is 6'9
[0:41:14] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly For the most part I've had it fine. There was one time I played Sol and all the effects that splattered on COUNTER destroyed the framerate
[0:41:15] <Raven_In_A_Tree> apparently
[0:41:23] <leith_aziz> Other than that one time, it ran fine
[0:41:25] <+TopTieramisu> @Raven_In_A_Tree nice
[0:41:35] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree Nice

[0:41:55] <Raven_In_A_Tree> pot is over 8'
[0:42:03] <%Volvo4Loyf> GG wiki lists Faust as 9'3" or 9'4" jesus
[0:42:07] <leith_aziz> Faust is the tallest
[0:42:20] <gryffinp> Man, Baiken really is thoroughly insane, isn't she?
[0:42:25] <Frankenshop> That's tall enough to be an SCP
[0:42:25] <leith_aziz> That's why usually he's either hunched or crouching
[0:42:28] <+Shishi1205> how tall is kum?
[0:42:29] <leith_aziz> Yes. On Dustloop
[0:42:34] <Raven_In_A_Tree> may is 5'2
[0:42:43] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 The robot or the girl inside?
[0:42:43] <grimeything> what's the hitbox on her windbags
[0:42:45] <Halospaz117> Faust needs the giant ass scalpel just so he can reach the patients
[0:42:55] <+Shishi1205> robot
[0:42:58] <JayEarly> I‚Äôm pretty sure her close slash is plus like everyone else
[0:43:05] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly It's -2

[0:43:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[0:45:25] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly Privillege of being Japanese pickyEZ
[0:45:36] <+Bin_VV> So what's the lore reason for her arm pulling out all those weapons
[0:45:38] <JUJUxANONY> maybe you can do kabari after parry?
[0:45:43] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree Damn. He's a tall boy
[0:45:54] <+Shishi1205> she has the weapons on her sleeve
[0:46:00] <+Shishi1205> there's no arm in there
[0:46:19] <JayEarly> her armless sleeve is a bag of holding
[0:46:39] <leith_aziz> @Bin_VV There's no "lore" reason. That's just her arsenal she somehow packs in her sleeve. Video game logic. Like a character pulling an object from their ass
[0:46:55] <+TopTieramisu> the lore is shut up. it's cool
[0:47:04] <VJdarkworld> NO BAIKEN.... NO BUY...... Fun Baken, Fun Buy

[0:48:52] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Actually, GG does give answers for a lot of stuff. The amount of worldbuilding is insane, which is why I like it. But that's a topic for another time cohhNotes
[0:49:03] <+Bin_VV> Man fighting game weights don't make any sense
[0:49:18] <DSD24> @Raven_In_A_Tree oh man that's reminds me how Siegfried is like 120 pounds at like 6'2
[0:49:20] <JayEarly> @bin_vv try basically any Japanese game
[0:49:31] <leith_aziz> @Bin_VV Does that hold true in most medias though? cohhHmm
[0:49:32] <Raven_In_A_Tree> sol is 163lbs
[0:49:40] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu oh i'm sure. but where does the tatami gaeshi come from?
[0:49:58] <leith_aziz> Me who's EU: I dont understand these terms! doodOuch
[0:49:59] <+Shishi1205> unless you are a sumo man then you are underweight in all fgs
[0:50:01] <Halospaz117> I dunno, Backyard?
[0:50:07] <five_foo> Tatami is stored in the cleavge.
[0:50:15] <Mach5Mike> @DSD24 I thought Siegfried was 5'6
[0:50:18] <nmaten> baiken is fun af in strive
[0:50:19] <Raven_In_A_Tree> ky is 128lbs
[0:50:26] <Halospaz117> Baiken has the Backyard in her cleavage, boom, problem solved
[0:50:28] <%elderpunch> i wish baiken got an actual redesign
[0:50:40] <leith_aziz> Pounds, Feet, meanwhile im used to cm, Kg, etc
[0:50:44] <DSD24> @Mach5Mike Wait yeah I think you are right
[0:50:45] <leith_aziz> pickyAYAYA
[0:50:49] <+TopTieramisu> arcsys was too scared to followup on the slam dunk design of xrd
[0:50:49] <velgaduere> Ky being 128lbs doesn't seem completely unbelievable
[0:50:55] <+Shishi1205> nago is 96 kg
[0:50:59] <Mach5Mike> @DSD24 He's shorter than Ivy, who is over 6 feet
[0:51:06] <thomasvalentine31> to quote a friend of mine in her own words: Boobs: the universal female pocket
[0:51:07] <+pupil31> This baiken design is gonna be the Morrigan design of GG lol
[0:51:09] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 eciN pickyEZ
[0:51:12] <DSD24> I think I was mixed up on other characters so I appreciate the correction @Mach5Mike

[0:51:31] <tanarath> Has Wollie discovered Baiken's counter-reversal throw?
[0:51:31] <user_naim> lbs -> kg is divide by two, minus a tenth of the half
[0:51:34] <+TopTieramisu> i prefer them more or less keeping the same design than what sfv did to juri
[0:51:34] <leith_aziz> This will not stop being funny
[0:51:38] <JayEarly> well at least they made a new model this time
[0:51:42] <Raven_In_A_Tree> 5'10 128 lbs that man's a twig wearing clothes
[0:51:43] <+R0kushi> lmao dont compare this to morrigan sprite
[0:51:47] <SethYuikora> Hey Woolie/Reggie/Chat
[0:51:48] <Mach5Mike> @DSD24 It's all good doodShake
[0:51:50] <+Akizea> sf5 juri looks really good imo
[0:51:51] <five_foo> I also like early grungy Baiken from GG1..
[0:51:57] <user_naim> hi @sethyuikora
[0:52:01] <+TopTieramisu> morrigan's sprite didn't chagne for decades. that's nothing like baiken's case
[0:52:04] <+TopTieramisu> change*
[0:52:06] <Halospaz117> Early Baiken is still a good design, I just like this one more
[0:52:08] <DSD24> I will say I like the goggle eyepatch a lot
[0:52:17] <DSD24> Gotta protect the eye after all
[0:52:21] <thomasvalentine31> this is baiken's best design
[0:52:32] <%elderpunch> i do prefer ggx baiken
[0:52:34] <DSD24> Ahaha
[0:52:36] <+Shishi1205> @thomasvalentine31 bro the XX one is rad as hell
[0:52:48] <%elderpunch> the bigger hair is awesome tho
[0:52:52] <Sulfur_Boride> We got opinions on the tether so far?
[0:52:52] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu I like re-designs a lot because they give the artist a way to convey a character's change/growth with a new look. That's why I love Strive's redesigns pickyCozy It's simillar to Terry's redesign in Garou
[0:53:02] <SethYuikora> knife, floorboard, GUN
[0:53:05] <velgaduere> regardless what you think of the "ears", her hair is definitely superior in design here compared to OG
[0:53:17] <Sulfur_Boride> The best redesigns are ones that still keep the essence of the character intact
[0:53:23] <leith_aziz> I personally prefer teh more modern Baiken look simply because of the Black Jacket. It looks too good
[0:53:24] <%elderpunch> boobgate
[0:53:26] <Halospaz117> I seriously never even noticed the "ears", still think that's a stretch
[0:53:34] <+Axellogic> I just woke up, So hows Cerberus playing in this?
[0:53:35] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like baiken's old design lacked the ecclecticness to match the other GG characters as the series progressed. her current look works in that regard
[0:53:36] <+R0kushi> I dont like how baiken moves in older games
[0:53:51] <velgaduere> @Halospaz117 same. and if anything, I think her entire hair ordeal evokes that of a nine-tailed fox, not a cat lmao
[0:53:56] <JayEarly> Potemkin‚Äôs design barely changed so I guess there is precedent
[0:54:02] <Raven_In_A_Tree> people talking about redesigns while Zato and pot look the same
[0:54:15] <+Akizea> @velgaduere izuna is RIGHT THERE
[0:54:18] <+R0kushi> eddie got the redesign though
[0:54:19] <Halospaz117> Her hairs already all over the place, why are those 2 strands gonna stick out to me?
[0:54:28] <Mach5Mike> evoPerfect
[0:54:28] <leith_aziz> What's the name of the Nine-Tailed fox? I have a feeling Baiken's hair draws inspiration from it
[0:54:30] <+Shishi1205> I mean pot has changed a lot in GG history
[0:54:32] <velgaduere> @Akizea LUL
[0:54:32] <%elderpunch> @JayEarly he has the cool mask details under the helmet so thats cool
[0:54:39] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu would you feel that way if they redesigned rock howard? it really depends. imo Krohnen looks way worse than K9999
[0:54:41] <thomasvalentine31> @leith_aziz Kyuubi No Kitsune
[0:54:42] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree Eddie got the glowup this time
[0:54:45] <five_foo> I like to think that Baiken was down on her luck in the first games. She lloked emaciated. Now she's stacked because she can take care and eats plenty.
[0:54:46] <leith_aziz> pickyProud
[0:54:46] <Sulfur_Boride> Well, Pot's redsign was a huge overhaul, so I can sorta understand why they decided to stick with it in Strive.
[0:55:05] <GUDDAY12> I for one am happy they moved on from the kenshin inspired baiken cuz fuck anything that has to do with that series and that piece of shit watsuki
[0:55:14] <Halospaz117> @GUDDAY12 Honestly, yeah
[0:55:17] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Sure, if they did it right. Nothing wrong with a Rock redesign
[0:55:17] <@Menitta> I still think Millia has had the best design progression in the series
[0:55:18] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Eddie do look good
[0:55:22] <%elderpunch> @GUDDAY12 fair LUL
[0:55:26] <velgaduere> Pot's redesign was just Daisuke saying "hey I have this cool armor concept designed. imma put it on somebody"
[0:55:29] <%slayabee> DAMN
[0:55:35] <%elderpunch> @Menitta that jacket does wonders
[0:55:35] <+Mrbaconator> spiderman pointing meme but baikens parrying at each other
[0:55:42] <leith_aziz> @GUDDAY12 What's Kenshin?
[0:55:55] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I just want to know why millia has a license plate on her head
[0:55:57] <velgaduere> @Menitta it's very strong. she got a better glow up than Sonya, who's probably the best comparison
[0:56:01] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu redesigns are hit or miss. kyo's best look is still his NESTS look imo
[0:56:03] <Halospaz117> Manga that Baiken's design was inspired from, creator's a piece of shit who got caught withh CP
[0:56:04] <atomicxdj> Hello @WoolieVersus so how is baiken gameplay wise feeling to you?
[0:56:06] <thomasvalentine31> @GUDDAY12 the anime character
[0:56:06] <@Menitta> Her new design with her old colors tho

[0:56:09] <+Shishi1205> baiken says no gaps in yuour strings bitch
[0:56:11] <JayEarly> @raven_in_a_tree for her haircar
[0:56:11] <leith_aziz> @Menitta They made Millia look more Russian, which is nice.
[0:56:40] <%SirGO0SE> Millia a true queen in this game
[0:56:47] <velgaduere> the only Strive redesign I'm not completely sold on is Leo's mostly because of the color palette
[0:56:50] <Halospaz117> I know most character's don't have an accent matching their nationality, but DAMN I wish Millia had a Russian accent, and yes it's entirely cuz I find them attractive
[0:56:51] <+Shishi1205> lmaooo
[0:56:54] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree It's a refrence to Zato's older VA's date of birth. It's in his memory

[0:57:37] <xerotwo> No gun Kappa
[0:57:39] <%illtima> Brought gun to a sword fight
[0:57:40] <Sulfur_Boride> Speaking of characters being from certain countries, I sorta half want English Happy Chaos to have a voice set where Robbie Daymond does his best Irish accent.
[0:57:42] <+TopTieramisu> chipp looks like he's going through his shippuden sasuke phase
[0:57:42] <AverageHanzo> Chipp looks cool, other than his rope belt
[0:57:44] <Raven_In_A_Tree> between his huge shoulders tiny head and shark teeth
[0:57:46] <Halospaz117> Slayer just sounding like Sean Connery was an inspired choice in my opinion
[0:57:47] <leith_aziz> @Halospaz117 Strive's dub is great
[0:57:53] <@Menitta> Oh man I'm picturing millia combos when teathered
[0:57:59] <Raven_In_A_Tree> and his Mc hammer ninja pants
[0:58:03] <leith_aziz> Of course im gonna stick JP because Joji Naka doodOK

[0:59:49] <@Menitta> jeeez that damage
[0:59:50] <Sulfur_Boride> So is the lore reason behind Chipp having cardboard health is due to the drugs fucking up his body from when he was an addict? Did the drugs also allow him to triple jump?

[1:00:22] <thomasvalentine31> @Sulfur_Boride triple jumping is probably from his ninja training though

[1:00:32] <leith_aziz> @thepardack THIS
[1:00:46] <leith_aziz> Sorry pros, but I dont wanna see an SFV training stage most of the time
[1:00:47] <+Shishi1205> lmao the tatami's clashing
[1:01:05] <%Volvo4Loyf> tatami clash
[1:01:30] <thomasvalentine31> Why clash fists when you can have door mats clash?
[1:01:31] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Cant wait for Dizzy mains to start bitchin like I-No "mains"
[1:01:52] <ghilbor> leo moment
[1:01:52] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu you mean about her design?
[1:02:06] <JayEarly> Local I-No ‚Äúmains‚Äùcomplaining their character got hotter
[1:02:08] <leith_aziz> Sol didnt get a major new look, but I do really like his biker looking jacket. It looks so badass
[1:02:11] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I main ino but strive is my first gg
[1:02:19] <leith_aziz> That and the black undershirt
[1:02:20] <%elderpunch> @TopTieramisu implying dizzy in goinna be in strive
[1:02:29] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I don't like her glasses though
[1:02:33] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu never say never
[1:02:37] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Everyone'll be in Strive at one point. Most of them likely
[1:02:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @TopTieramisu she's definitely gonna be in, it's only a matter of time
[1:02:59] <Raven_In_A_Tree> her eyes color changing is like her best feature the glasses cover that
[1:03:01] <%elderpunch> dizzys design is way too overdesgined even for guilty gear
[1:03:03] <+Akizea> I'm willing to bet Jam is next tho, then dizzy
[1:03:04] <@Menitta> Dizzy is the most popular character iirc
[1:03:21] <+TopTieramisu> in japan?
[1:03:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ^
[1:03:22] <thepardack> Who does Reggie usually play in Strive?
[1:03:24] <NotHereToStream> i thought bridget was
[1:03:27] <@Menitta> At least in Japan
[1:03:29] <leith_aziz> @Menitta 2nd. Baiken is 1st, and Johnny is 3rd
[1:03:32] <thomasvalentine31> I would love Justice to appear. Probably won't happen though
[1:03:36] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like baiken is the big fav
[1:03:37] <%elderpunch> im pretty sure its bridget
[1:03:38] <@Menitta> Dizzy won the poll for Xrd
[1:03:45] <leith_aziz> (in terms of popularity based off the Strive polls during the beta)
[1:03:45] <JayEarly> isn‚Äôt Bridget the most wanted character in Japan
[1:03:56] <Wakka47> @thepardack he plays millia
[1:03:57] <user_naim> @thepardack millia, i think
[1:04:03] <%elderpunch> @JayEarly they are
[1:04:05] <@Menitta> Baiken and Bridget were to follow
[1:04:06] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly Yes
[1:04:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a lot of P-s going on tonight huh
[1:04:13] <@Menitta> this is as of Xrd though
[1:04:13] <JayEarly> @toptieramisu Baiken is the big fave OUTSIDE Japan ironically
[1:04:20] <%Grimlockfly> Dizzy has being popular and seem like would be plot important
[1:04:21] <+TopTieramisu> johnny's definitely making it in. i wonder how they'll handle his design
[1:04:28] <%elderpunch> japan seems to love femboys
[1:04:35] <@Menitta> I want Johnny so bad
[1:04:36] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly I guess Baiken looks too nationalistic for Japa? cohhHmm
[1:04:37] <VJdarkworld> as the meme goes "No baiken, no buy.... er- NO dizzy, no buy... WAit No bridget no buy"
[1:04:43] <+Akizea> femboys are a new age wave
[1:04:48] <%elderpunch> wait is bridget a femboy?
[1:04:50] <leith_aziz> @Menitta He'll show up at one point
[1:04:55] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I want Bridget to have the same outfit but come in buff af like the other dudes in strive
[1:04:56] <+TopTieramisu> bridget is a femboy
[1:05:00] <thomasvalentine31> @elderpunch Bridgit is a guy
[1:05:06] <%elderpunch> @TopTieramisu based
[1:05:12] <leith_aziz> @elderpunch Bridget is a boy, but his parents has to hide his gender because they live in a cult
[1:05:21] <+Akizea> honestly? wouldn't mind seeing a new age A.b.a or zappa
[1:05:33] <leith_aziz> @Akizea More JoJo is A-ok in my book
[1:05:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:05:33] <zenith0111> Bridget is man and proud of it
[1:05:34] <thepardack> I'd love to see a new ABA
[1:05:40] <thepardack> mostly for the design
[1:05:50] <Sulfur_Boride> If they add Bridget, should they make up some weird justification for why he still looks like a girl, or should they actually go with making him more masculine looking?
[1:05:53] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I tend to see people asking for ABA often
[1:05:55] <+TopTieramisu> who's that old guy with the giant halberd in the original GG?
[1:06:03] <NotHereToStream> kliff?
[1:06:04] <%elderpunch> @TopTieramisu hes dead
[1:06:06] <zenith0111> Bridget wants people to see him as a Man despite the upbringing
[1:06:07] <thomasvalentine31> Didn't Zappa get the ghost knocked out of him yet or he still dealing with that?
[1:06:11] <leith_aziz> But I have no idea when and if it'll happen. I'll be optimistic for her fans
[1:06:14] <+Akizea> I'd love to see how they modernize aba tbh
[1:06:19] <KaiGoesMoo> It'd be hilarious if Bridget returns as the BUFFEST dude
[1:06:21] <JayEarly> Bridget was raised as a girl and is thus super insecure about his masculinity which is why he became a bounty hunter
[1:06:23] <+QuestJefferson> Zappa is no longer possessed, and became a paranormal researcher afterwards
[1:06:30] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Kliff
[1:06:42] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Bridget but he's built like a JOJO part 3 character
[1:06:45] <zenith0111> @jayearly Opposite. Very secure about their masculinity
[1:06:47] <%elderpunch> LUL
[1:06:50] <+MoonXBearX> we want Testament or we riot... period
[1:06:55] <zenith0111> The dress is a choice now
[1:07:05] <%elderpunch> that walk tho
[1:07:05] <thepardack> I don't want testament lol
[1:07:06] <leith_aziz> @Raven_In_A_Tree Perfect pickyAYAYA
[1:07:14] <@Menitta> Bridget wasnt even in Xrd so that'd be interesting
[1:07:18] <NotHereToStream> i want venom to come back, but not in his original costume, but as a baker, using baguette as his weapon
[1:07:22] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[1:07:23] <%elderpunch> bridget but hes built like machamp
[1:07:24] <leith_aziz> Im fine with Testament, mostly because im a lorehead
[1:07:26] <xerotwo> OOP AHH! LUL
[1:07:26] <thomasvalentine31> the disrespect with that walk stride during the cancel
[1:07:30] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes
[1:07:30] <+Demoli_PT> that tether is so jank
[1:07:30] <+ar4ndomblackguy> why doesnt reggie ever blue RC?
[1:07:44] <+TopTieramisu> if they bring back sin kiske, i hope to god they overhaul his design
[1:07:49] <VJdarkworld> ".... AND i took that personally"
[1:07:52] <+TopTieramisu> i HATE his look
[1:07:56] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream Baker Venom, Robo Ky as the balls. Work on it Arcsys pickyPog
[1:08:00] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I just want Elphelt back to see xrd players lose it
[1:08:01] <thepardack> @TopTieramisu PLEASE. His costume is so bad.
[1:08:03] <zenith0111> @toptieramisu Sins moveset usually relfects Kys
[1:08:08] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu Man, Sin REALLY needs a new look
[1:08:10] <NotHereToStream> @leith_aziz set
[1:08:15] <leith_aziz> Maybe more than anyone else
[1:08:16] <zenith0111> So sin is 100% getting a dragon install
[1:08:29] <JayEarly> i didn‚Äôt know Sin‚Äôs design was so disliked
[1:08:33] <%elderpunch> @TopTieramisu hes xrd design STINKS
[1:08:33] <+TopTieramisu> sin kiske's design has big shun-ei energy
[1:08:33] <DSD24> Nah Sin has cool flag combos he pulls off his look real well
[1:08:38] <+MoonXBearX> @JayEarly right!
[1:09:03] <leith_aziz> @JayEarly I dont know, it looks all over the place, and I know we're talking GG, but even for older games, it was not working
[1:09:08] <kikoeru_san> nah Sin is wearing clogs or some shit, anti drip shoes
[1:09:14] <thepardack> His elbow gloves and shoulderless thing going on is just so wack lookin
[1:09:19] <VJdarkworld> is reggie gonna become baiken main after this?
[1:09:30] <leith_aziz> @VJdarkworld Wasnt he from teh start? pickySmug
[1:09:33] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I just like sins eyepatch
[1:09:35] <+MoonXBearX> @kikoeru_san clogs are drippy boy what you talkin bout
[1:09:38] <%Volvo4Loyf> what about the massive brass on the front of his pans though
[1:09:40] <VJdarkworld> @leith_aziz :O
[1:09:50] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I just like eyepatch in general
[1:09:51] <%elderpunch> @thepardack his terrible half shirt lmao
[1:09:54] <big_oki> i blame woolie for gettin baiken tits bigger
[1:09:56] <+TopTieramisu> sin looks like his wardrobe was designed by an AI
[1:10:08] <leith_aziz> The eyepatch is fine. I do like how when he goes all out it flashes. Cool characterisation
[1:10:18] <user_naim> wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing competetive nago vs baiken from woolz and reg eventually
[1:10:23] <kikoeru_san> miss me with that, Sin's clogs rub me the wrong way
[1:10:26] <zenith0111> @toptieramisu Technically Sol made his clothes. Sol owns a clothing franchise that Ky and others buy from
[1:10:26] <leith_aziz> @user_naim Samurai duels
[1:10:41] <+TopTieramisu> @zenith0111 please tell me his franchise is floundering
[1:10:43] <leith_aziz> @zenith0111 Oh really? That's dope
[1:10:44] <NotHereToStream> i just want the american president from the story to be playable
[1:10:45] <Aussie_Manny> Nothin' good ever comes from Sin, brudda.
[1:10:49] <JayEarly> @zenith0111 is this canon
[1:10:56] <zenith0111> @toptieramisu Almost every9ne wears his stuff lmao
[1:10:59] <pixel_river> funny how baiken is one of the easiest dlc characters so far
[1:11:02] <leith_aziz> @Aussie_Manny DOOM would like to differ pickySmug
[1:11:04] <zenith0111> @jayearly Extremely
[1:11:23] <zenith0111> Daisuke even had a lore explaination for drip
[1:11:36] <zenith0111> Sol in the rooms drawing shirts and shit
[1:11:36] <user_naim> can you parry nago‚Äôs blood explosion?
[1:11:42] <%elderpunch> i would love to the walk after the RC be used to taunt in pro matches
[1:11:42] <user_naim> like nullify it?
[1:11:50] <%elderpunch> see the*
[1:11:52] <JayEarly> so Sol is a fashion designer AND a bounty hunter?
[1:11:57] <leith_aziz> @pixel_river Makes sense. You make a very popular character approachable. I felt like they probably should have done the same with Jack-O during her popularity, but there's nothing wrong with how they made her
[1:12:00] <zenith0111> @jayearly Yes-
[1:12:11] <NotHereToStream> sol is a fucking scientist too, what isn't he?
[1:12:15] <leith_aziz> Damn, I suddenly love Sol even more
[1:12:16] <Aussie_Manny> What're we, some kinda Tatami Galaxy?
[1:12:18] <+TopTieramisu> sol owning a fashion company is some of the weirdest lore i've heard about GG yet
[1:12:19] <leith_aziz> pickyPog
[1:12:24] <%elderpunch> @NotHereToStream a good man
[1:12:28] <JayEarly> @notheretostream fucking Renaissance Man
[1:12:30] <thepardack> I'm too stupid for the other DLC characters.
[1:12:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @pixel_river and Jack-o is harder now then she was in XRD
[1:12:31] <+QuestJefferson> When you're like 400 years old you have time to pick up sewing.
[1:12:32] <%elderpunch> cuz hes a
[1:12:33] <Raven_In_A_Tree> sol isn't a great dad tbh
[1:12:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:12:34] <%elderpunch> bad guy
[1:12:39] <%elderpunch> LUL
[1:12:49] <NotHereToStream> goddammit elderpunch -2
[1:12:51] <@Menitta> One thing I dont like about Baiken's theme is the intro is too long. It'd be like hearing just the beginning of Bury the Light and then the match ends by I AM TH-
[1:12:56] <zenith0111> @raven_in_a_tree Idk Dizzy pulled a King. Think Sol eeked it out lol
[1:13:07] <Raven_In_A_Tree> feeds sin sugar water as a treat
[1:13:08] <JayEarly> @raven_in_a_tree sugar water
[1:13:19] <big_oki> dayum was that cross up
[1:13:20] <%elderpunch> @NotHereToStream woolieKICKDAD
[1:13:24] <+TopTieramisu> i do prefer baiken's old theme
[1:13:25] <pixel_river> @leith_aziz yes jack o is a simpler version of herself but easily one of the hardest characters
[1:13:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:13:30] <leith_aziz> Sol's parentage game is not the best pickyBlush
[1:13:34] <Aussie_Manny> "Real"?! How dare!
[1:13:37] <Raven_In_A_Tree> plus he dresses sin apparently and thats just odd
[1:13:43] <%mr_sups> While Reggie plays MILLIA
[1:13:46] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[1:13:52] <%townzzzzz> are you saying that your soul is weight down by gravity
[1:14:06] <+CryptusMaximus> you we reverse Perfectin'?
[1:14:36] <hamahiroyuki> ah, btw, according to wools' lore vids is there ppl who ship ramlethal with sin? excuse me and sorry if im brain farting
[1:14:40] <+TopTieramisu> G U N
[1:14:44] <big_oki> point blank
[1:14:44] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Funny thing. Every DLC song gets longer than the previous one. I think this is the longest one by far, inluding the base songs
[1:14:47] <+ar4ndomblackguy> atpLaw
[1:15:04] <%elderpunch> baikens old theme made me want to throw a table
[1:15:05] <zenith0111> @hamahiroyuki Its more like a brother sister thing. Fans then elevated it and shipped them
[1:15:07] <Aussie_Manny> God, that win screen's fucking cool. BigPhish
[1:15:07] <Raven_In_A_Tree> ramlethal is like sins aunt though thats weird
[1:15:11] <%elderpunch> such a banger
[1:15:19] <mothdude> The Sol family tree is wild
[1:15:26] <Raven_In_A_Tree> or grandma? the lore is weird
[1:15:27] <leith_aziz> @hamahiroyuki You dont need to worry about that now. Ram's falling for our King, Leo pickyProud
[1:15:44] <+CryptusMaximus> I looove how this song builds, but yeah it should probably start how it starts in the Trailer
[1:16:08] <+CryptusMaximus> Begin with the baseline and get into the metal parts sooner
[1:16:11] <%SirGO0SE> shes got a couple different audio takes for the tatami gaeshi huh?
[1:16:18] <hamahiroyuki> ah thx, at least ppl aint be as weird as with mha
[1:16:19] <kikoeru_san> Yo
[1:16:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> tossed LUL
[1:16:22] <zenith0111> PARRIED
[1:16:23] <%Volvo4Loyf> That parry though.
[1:16:25] <JayEarly> the valentines are clones of Sol‚Äôs gf?
[1:16:26] <Raven_In_A_Tree> well ram thinks leo is cool, which to be fair, is turw
[1:16:41] <Raven_In_A_Tree> true*
[1:16:46] <JayEarly> does that mean Ramlethal is like Sin‚Äôs great aunr
[1:17:05] <+TopTieramisu> ramlethal, the rei of GG
[1:17:18] <Raven_In_A_Tree> it's weird because technically elphelt jack o and ram are sisters

[1:19:09] <+CryptusMaximus> @R0kushi just treat it like a "down from up" half circle. Although technically the last input needs to be up-forward when you hit S.
[1:19:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @JayEarly god, we can only hope
[1:19:17] <hamahiroyuki> personhood in gg is weirder than kingdom hearts

[1:20:07] <Aussie_Manny> woolieYIKES Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. DAMN IT!
[1:20:17] <zenith0111> Jacko is incomplete and has to dtay attached to her ball thingy for life support and eat special candy to keep her alive
[1:20:23] <zenith0111> stay*
[1:20:24] <hamahiroyuki> at least everyone gets their own person and theres no "technically"

[1:21:07] <+TopTieramisu> what's the lore implication of the jack'o pose?
[1:21:26] <Raven_In_A_Tree> that she's hot I guess
[1:21:29] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu Its cute
[1:21:30] <+Akizea> quirky
[1:21:34] <NotHereToStream> no idea, she can contort in various ways

[1:29:51] <leith_aziz> I dont know, Soul Calibur did it first pickySmug
[1:30:08] <%SirGO0SE> im nearly positive im going to lose to your baiken already LUL
[1:30:21] <+TopTieramisu> in the next GG, the song will begin in round 2
[1:30:27] <InXplotch> it is tragic that 3/4 of the DLC characters have guns
[1:30:28] <@Menitta> I hate being that guy but if I get a match in I'm gonna be Millia lmao
[1:30:31] <%Th3rd3> I feel like everyone gonna try the exclusive Baiken combo on Woolie and Reggie
[1:30:31] <InXplotch> they should give jack o a gun
[1:30:40] <InXplotch> or at the very least her miniosn deserve a gun
[1:30:51] <%SirGO0SE> oh man if her minions pulled out gats
[1:30:51] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu That could be hype if done right ngl. Like the song shifts to the winning character's theme
[1:30:53] <%SirGO0SE> thatd be tight
[1:31:00] <chillygreem> The lollipops do them just fine
[1:31:05] <InXplotch> if I had no respect I'd pull up with ram
[1:31:13] <DSD24> Pull up with Ram though shes awesome
[1:31:15] <%SirGO0SE> @InXplotch i dont and am :)
[1:31:17] <InXplotch> but I will just mash buttons on angry sword lady
[1:31:33] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu dynamic music like revengeance would be dope
[1:31:49] <+TopTieramisu> like the song speeding up or adding vocals near the end of a round
[1:32:11] <zenith0111> Thats literally older GG music
[1:32:14] <jimgimp> Is her opening specifically like an oldschool samurai film?
[1:32:22] <DSD24> Or how Killer Instinct the music gets different a lower health
[1:32:22] <InXplotch> more or less yes
[1:32:23] <leith_aziz> Pot grabs you: DISCORD! PRESIIIIDEES!
[1:32:24] <%ekodrop> ekodrop subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Baiken!
[1:32:35] <+Akizea> @toptieramisu oh God gg should 100% do that
[1:32:50] <+Akizea> it's absolutely fucking ridiculous that more games don't have the music kick in when you're doing hype shit
[1:33:03] <@Menitta> In my mind I just think back to the night Terry came out, I was playing with people, someone didnt like him and he busted out his Main Bowser as we're all trying to figure out the character
[1:33:08] <+Akizea> revengence showed everyone how absolutely sick as fuck it is and DMC5 showed it even more
[1:33:29] <leith_aziz> @Akizea Likely because its a ton of work. Even Yakuza games, which I feel are perfect for it, dont do it
[1:33:48] <+Akizea> when that shit happens in FFXIV  I get hype every time
[1:33:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:51] <jimgimp> You have to be a true gamer to get the full experience with dmc5 of course
[1:33:51] <+TopTieramisu> @Akizea for sure. even having the music stop when you activate a super would be awesome
[1:34:26] <user_naim> Revengeance‚Äôs boss theme progression should be easier to implement at least.
[1:34:34] <leith_aziz> @jimgimp Reminds me ofthat one comment about a journalist saying DMC5's music is bad because he could never play well enough to get to the best parts
[1:34:41] <Lunalios> are we all in agreement that the new stage is the best one?
[1:34:53] <DSD24> @leith_aziz Man was that pretty funny
[1:35:00] <+Akizea> I'll always be reminded of the DMCV sword clash music scene in terms of like music hitting at the right time
[1:35:04] <InXplotch> doesnt the new stage lag though?
[1:35:07] <InXplotch> so its not the best one
[1:35:09] <+TopTieramisu> game journalists exist to give material to scrubquotes
[1:35:10] <leith_aziz> The Colony and stages related to it are always S-tier in my book pickyOkay
[1:35:15] <Lunalios> oh does it?
[1:35:16] <w_khan> Thank god for Potato mod
[1:35:18] <DSD24> 1 more 1 more
[1:35:29] <leith_aziz> I will say that I also really love Axl's stage. Has a lot of personality to it and nice worldbuilding
[1:35:44] <InXplotch> I like the new york stage but its laggy as fuck
[1:35:48] <Lunalios> that's my second fav, yeah
[1:35:48] <jimgimp> @leith_aziz Exactly what i was thinking lol
[1:35:51] <user_naim> @akizea ooh yeah that was sick
[1:36:17] <leith_aziz> New York is also great, mostly becuse it's pretty creative
[1:36:28] <leith_aziz> I like checking all the billbords and stuff outside the stage
[1:36:57] <jimgimp> Have there ever been any cross-overs with Gulity Gear?
[1:37:04] <DSD24> Samsho
[1:37:07] <leith_aziz> Honestly, a lot of GG stages are pretty good at this. The dead skeletons of Gears in Sol's stage, The Buddhist imagery in Pot's stages, etc
[1:37:15] <+TopTieramisu> @jimgimp samurai shodown
[1:37:16] <+Akizea> no crossovers INTO guilty gear
[1:37:22] <leith_aziz> @jimgimp Movile games and Samsho
[1:37:26] <+Akizea> but there's crossovers of guilty gear into other stuff
[1:37:27] <+ar4ndomblackguy> lmaooo
[1:37:30] <+CryptusMaximus> @jimgimp Baiken appeared in Samurai Shodown
[1:37:31] <%Rasheedt> woolieYE woolieYE
[1:37:32] <Lunalios> not in game but in other franchises yes
[1:37:37] <leith_aziz> But GG has never done crossoevers in their own games
[1:37:37] <InXplotch> gotta drift back out
[1:38:22] <InXplotch> there isnt much you can do
[1:38:35] <jimgimp> I wonder whether or not the franchise is one that would work well in crossovers in general being that a lot of aspects are influenced by other stuff already
[1:38:53] <InXplotch> you can S kabari if I recall but you have to manually time it
[1:39:03] <leith_aziz> @jimgimp I mean, BB-Tag exists, and I feel like GG could be more sucessfull than how that game turned out
[1:39:14] <Lunalios> does anyone know the relationship between baiken and anji? I saw old game stuff where they're calling each other sis and bro, but also people shipping them.
[1:39:20] <+TopTieramisu> it's hard to imagine a gg character will ever be as cool in another game as they are in gg
[1:39:25] <leith_aziz> I would be all for crossovers if it broadens interest in the series
[1:39:36] <InXplotch> most 6ps dont get much off counterhit outside of corner
[1:39:56] <%emptyantics> We need at least 1 crossover character into GG so we can appreciate the art even more
[1:39:59] <InXplotch> Nago gets a ton
[1:40:09] <+TopTieramisu> a character being brought INTO gg would be hype af
[1:40:10] <+Demoli_PT> nago is one of the few characters that can get a good 6p punish
[1:40:12] <InXplotch> nago is priveleged
[1:40:15] <+Demoli_PT> without meter
[1:40:19] <%elderpunch> @emptyantics Sans from undertale
[1:40:27] <+Demoli_PT> most characters get a 6p special at best
[1:40:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'd rather have both a new and returning character over a crossover any day
[1:40:34] <leith_aziz> @Lunalios It's important to note that Daisuke wasnt involved in XX's arcade stuff. From what I've seen in Strive, it doesnt seem romantic, allthough Anji tends to tease/flirt, but he could be playing around
[1:40:42] <user_naim> Bring Laura from SFV into Strive
[1:40:46] <%emptyantics> @elderpunch Ronanduru from Mugen
[1:40:48] <+TopTieramisu> @emptyantics a glass cannon that makes chipp look like potemkin
[1:40:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:40:55] <+francopus> francopus subscribed with Prime. 
[1:41:06] <+Akizea> I'd love if Strive was the first gg to ever have a crossover character
[1:41:07] <leith_aziz> I've gotten a stronger sense of "brother/sis" relationship personally. Baiken's not really interested in that stuff
[1:41:20] <%emptyantics> Baiken X Nago
[1:41:40] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu GG getting an NRS character and making good animations for once
[1:41:43] <+TopTieramisu> baiken X nago's sword
[1:41:46] <InXplotch> You're probably better off just running oki off the knockdown
[1:41:52] <%emptyantics> @leith_aziz LUL
[1:41:55] <+Demoli_PT> baiken and anji have a relationship more colloquially known as "friends"
[1:41:57] <leith_aziz> 2 Samurais in one game. GG is blesses and based
[1:41:58] <+Akizea> @leith_aziz Tru LUL
[1:42:00] <Lunalios> @leith_aziz see that's what I was thinking. Baiken's sexuality is sword.
[1:42:02] <InXplotch> or take the tether
[1:42:17] <InXplotch> "How come Daisuke lets you have TWO samurai?"
[1:42:29] <NoobJunglerGG> maybe iAD tatami after RC?
[1:42:35] <InXplotch> jS, not jD
[1:42:38] <+TopTieramisu> @InXplotch samsho sulking in the background
[1:42:40] <SaiyanShoto> Baiken and Anji relationship is girlboss and malewife
[1:42:41] <InXplotch> after airdash cancel
[1:42:41] <+CryptusMaximus> Baiken vs Nago is like some cocaine-ized version of SamSho
[1:42:54] <%elderpunch> we need a guilty gear character who is just a cool fellow
[1:42:54] <+Akizea> if you wanna imply baiken has any type of horny, it'd be to people stronger than her  I guess?
[1:42:55] <leith_aziz> F'ck it, Nago's been alone for long. I'd ship it cohhHug
[1:43:04] <+Akizea> she seems like the type
[1:43:06] <InXplotch> baiken has anji
[1:43:19] <InXplotch> and anji has chipp
[1:43:21] <+TopTieramisu> is anji stronger than baiken?
[1:43:32] <%emptyantics> @akizea 100% Canon (in my head)
[1:43:33] <leith_aziz> @elderpunch Axl. I know he's got JoJo stuff, but he's a chill bro
[1:43:35] <zenith0111> Anji x Chipp is the strongest relationship
[1:43:57] <+TopTieramisu> i thought chipp x answer would be the canon ship
[1:44:01] <InXplotch> you can delay the slash by holding H
[1:44:11] <InXplotch> but I dont think that matters actually
[1:44:14] <%emptyantics> Chipp and Answer are the power couple
[1:44:23] <+Akizea> the only people who are cannonballs together in gg I believe are sol x Jacko, KY x dizzy,  and now Axl x ino
[1:44:26] <zenith0111> @inxplotch Its huge part of her game flow
[1:44:31] <+Akizea> canon* lol
[1:44:34] <@Menitta> the only Chipp I ship is with french onion dip
[1:44:37] <leith_aziz> My headcanon is that Chipp hired Anji cause he found out he's from Japan.
[1:44:39] <InXplotch> no, sorry, I meant for the situation woolie was testing
[1:44:44] <%emptyantics> @menitta LUL LUL
[1:44:46] <InXplotch> delay will still make you go through so it doesnt matter
[1:44:51] <zenith0111> @akizea Zato x Millia or Zato x Venom
[1:44:59] <zenith0111> Forgot those canon relationships
[1:45:07] <+Akizea> Tru I meant currently
[1:45:31] <leith_aziz> @Akizea Ram is simping for Leo, and Zato would like to fix stuff with Millia. Add that cohhNotes
[1:45:37] <%emptyantics> Sexy crossuo
[1:45:40] <%emptyantics> *crossup
[1:45:42] <+TopTieramisu> johnny x johnny
[1:45:55] <zenith0111> Venom x Robo-Ky
[1:45:58] <leith_aziz> Poor Venom. Nice to know he's got a bro with Robo Ky though pickyFive1 pickyFive2
[1:45:58] <Lunalios> yeah zato and millia very much have awkward but still friends ex's
[1:46:22] <+Akizea> True true
[1:46:57] <+ozarkhunter> C.S tatami meaty?
[1:46:57] <Lunalios> I'd love robo ky to come back for some reason
[1:47:13] <leith_aziz> This is pretty simillar to Chipp wallrun stuff in the sense that you can get ambigious crossups

[1:59:38] <InXplotch> you just have to believe in 5s
[1:59:39] <Lunalios> Japan has always been very weird about drastic skin tone differences among skins
[1:59:41] <+Bin_VV> Ram really is straightforward

[2:00:34] <%elderpunch> @leith_aziz His strive look is so much better than his xrd
[2:00:36] <%SirGO0SE> @Bin_VV i dont think we can 214k vs baiken at all T_T
[2:00:37] <vingadivo> tether that twink woolie
[2:00:39] <InXplotch> most people do first to 3 though but you wont get through many like that
[2:00:41] <+CryptusMaximus> sets are so much more interesting to watch. Should reserve singles only for when you're not learning a new char
[2:00:58] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Very much. It's actually my favorite look yet
[2:01:04] <zenith0111> She can parry supers btw

[2:09:56] <%elderpunch> i will continue to say clown of fate
[2:10:03] <+Bin_VV> @Lunalios True but clown of fate sounds cooler
[2:10:09] <Lunalios> imma just shut up. I can't sarcasm
[2:10:14] <cheapdoc> What has priority command grab or regular grab?
[2:10:16] <@Menitta> idk about cooler LUL
[2:10:22] <@Menitta> funnier maybe
[2:10:29] <+kewlmyc> Funnier 100%
[2:10:37] <vingadivo> SILLY CLOOOWN
[2:10:43] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> command beats regular throw @cheapdoc
[2:10:43] <Lunalios> I'd say funnier
[2:10:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> You staring down your opponent and don't know what to do next? Megafist back
[2:10:53] <huskarl_zap> nice jump tbh
[2:10:56] <cheapdoc> @Meta_Yoroitoshi Much appreciated
[2:11:00] <+kewlmyc> bitch slapped
[2:11:01] <leith_aziz> You know its pretty sad that you never get to hear that last part of this song during a match, because that last part often gets me pretty emotional

[2:11:29] <+CryptusMaximus> Megafist has a shit ton of start up, so the first step to shutting down Pots is learning to parry that move
[2:11:31] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> anotha one
[2:11:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, another pot
[2:11:32] <+kewlmyc> MORE POTEMKIN

[2:13:36] <cheapdoc> What if you tether jump all day to stop megafisto?
[2:13:43] <%townzzzzz> da back down
[2:13:47] <big_oki> L E  A R M O R - just the scent
[2:13:48] <leith_aziz> This feels like when I first played against Zato and Pot as Sol. One of those matchups that feel akward at the start untill you start labbing a bit
[2:13:48] <user_naim> Boy does this theme fit
[2:13:50] <cheapdoc> Guess he could grab up
[2:13:51] <vingadivo> Potemkin has no power if you don't believe in him
[2:14:05] <chillygreem> be afraid
[2:14:08] <+Demoli_PT> can't believe mf goesnt get parry grab
[2:14:22] <+Bin_VV> Does Baiken have any long normals to help with this matchup?
[2:14:36] <+CryptusMaximus> Parrying megafist should work actually. You should get the throw, not sure what happened there
[2:14:45] <%Irridium> @Bin_VV crouching slash probably?
[2:14:50] <Lunalios> extended grab box pokempkin buster isn't real it can't hurt you
[2:14:51] <+yeknomlive> maybe it was because he was airborne
[2:14:52] <zenith0111> Parried the very tip of the fist
[2:14:54] <chillygreem> You really need to read the opponent right
[2:15:00] <user_naim> Ooh some I-no practice?
[2:15:02] <user_naim> nice
[2:15:02] <chillygreem> That's the whole point of the parry
[2:15:03] <+yeknomlive> does parry throw work on jump ins?
[2:15:06] <big_oki> classic matchup
[2:15:19] <zenith0111> @yeknomlive Yes and even supers
[2:15:26] <chillygreem> Is that why you keep doing tatami at the end of the combo woolie?
[2:15:27] <leith_aziz> @user_naim I dont know, this song is intentionally made soulles. As someone accepting his role and taking orders. Potemkin on the other hand always doubt himself and questions his actions. And yes, I caught the joke cohhFee
[2:15:29] <+ar4ndomblackguy> oooooh this match up is bad for ino?:0
[2:15:32] <+CryptusMaximus> a fellow I-No struggler : D
[2:15:38] <chillygreem> Because you think it will knocked them upward?

[2:23:52] <%townzzzzz> OVER HEAT GEYSER
[2:23:52] <velgaduere> this level is notoriously laggy, it's true
[2:23:53] <+JustToWatch> Menitta's PC hamster is getting tired
[2:23:54] <Lunalios> aye, iz my gurl
[2:23:55] <user_naim> Okay Daisuke we might need tone down her ballistics a bit
[2:23:59] <%SirGO0SE> Menitta like "works fine for me :) "
[2:24:10] <+LCGOV> this new patch has some glitches
[2:24:11] <leith_aziz> Ok, this EXACTLY happened with me on Baiken's stage once with Sol on Baiken's stage. Just go into lobby and try again
[2:24:11] <vingadivo> this level specifically fucks up my pc for some reason
[2:24:17] <zenith0111> WOW TAUNT? DISRESPECT
[2:24:19] <+Bin_VV> That pc doing overtime right now
[2:24:23] <+LCGOV> happy chaos got fucked apparently
[2:24:25] <Lunalios> GUN
[2:24:31] <+kewlmyc> Oh, it's actually game slowdown and not online lag? Does PS4/5 have this issue?
[2:24:34] <$Holycow8498> Bang bang
[2:24:34] <+LCGOV> and ky has a glitch with sacred edge now
[2:24:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:24:42] <chillygreem> It's a shame HC had a rough patch
[2:24:43] <%townzzzzz> NEVER GET RID OF THE TAUNT BUTTON
[2:24:45] <drefizz> LUL
[2:24:48] <TalisKanju> Is there also screen tearing?
[2:24:48] <@Menitta> Sorry about that slowdown. Dunno why that was happening
[2:24:49] <leith_aziz> I always keep taunt as a button
[2:24:52] <Lunalios> lmao
[2:24:52] <zenith0111> LUL
[2:24:52] <+Superbro64> what was Woolie doing with the taunt button I wonder? üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
[2:24:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's why you bind taunt to R3 and L3
[2:24:57] <chillygreem> Happy Chaos' clean hit stuff is gone :(
[2:24:59] <huskarl_zap> woolie taunted laynaSCREAM laynaWAH
[2:25:00] <drefizz> Menitta its not your fault
[2:25:05] <chillygreem> Why did they get rid of it?
[2:25:05] <@Menitta> GGs though
[2:25:10] <drefizz> its my fault
[2:25:13] <leith_aziz> A Ky player Burst baited me then Teabagged me constantly before dipping out
[2:25:22] <zenith0111> @chillygreem Oh yeah the Choas shadow nerfs
[2:25:25] <%SirGO0SE> could it have to do with using Oceania? whys that the strat anyway?
[2:25:25] <leith_aziz> Taunt PRC was done because Red RC scaled more
[2:25:33] <Lunalios> I have it on L1 but i just never touch it
[2:25:35] <Ai_VS> chipp's tanut can dodge heavy mob lol
[2:25:38] <+JustToWatch> @chillygreem it wasn't part of the patch notes, maybe it's a bug
[2:25:40] <leith_aziz> After Red RC got the same scaling as Purple, people stopped doing it
[2:25:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh it Faust
[2:25:46] <@Menitta> I wanna figure out why that was happening though
[2:25:46] <DSD24> Eyy its Faust
[2:25:48] <+CryptusMaximus> I have it set to touchpad
[2:25:50] <%townzzzzz> but do you have the balls to respect
[2:25:54] <+ar4ndomblackguy> time for bullshit
[2:25:55] <@Menitta> Because fuck, that's concerning
[2:25:56] <+Bin_VV> Faust boyz
[2:25:59] <leith_aziz> Faust... pickyTears
[2:26:00] <velgaduere> this oughta be interesting
[2:26:00] <+Superbro64> if someone taunts you in a match you cant just duff their ass and tbag after really, haha
[2:26:02] <Lunalios> spooky boy
[2:26:06] <DSD24> Nice shoes
[2:26:09] <%SirGO0SE> i think youre playing real well tbh
[2:26:17] <huskarl_zap> family guy faust
[2:26:33] <%elderpunch> Sol: "thats deep"
[2:26:34] <user_naim> @menitta new patch might just be borked
[2:26:34] <drefizz> Aye Lois
[2:26:36] <leith_aziz> Its nice that his Color 2 is a refrence to his old color
[2:26:42] <%townzzzzz> that's heavy
[2:26:44] <+Shishi1205> baiken walk is practically a taunt anyways
[2:26:50] <@Menitta> maybe
[2:27:00] <velgaduere> @huskarl_zap as punishment, I hope you imagine Peter Griffin singing Alone Infection
[2:27:03] <DSD24> Doesn't Baiken walk like that so she can see?
[2:27:03] <+CryptusMaximus> I forsee faust being extremely difficult to parry
[2:27:08] <%SirGO0SE> ms high on this game too
[2:27:10] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[2:27:11] <+ar4ndomblackguy> p o w!
[2:27:20] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I'm gonna go back to labbing baiken as well actually lol. I plan on picking her up, just gotta learn tether stuff
[2:27:30] <drefizz> I need to listen to Baiken's theme
[2:27:43] <huskarl_zap> @velgaduere better than beach boys apple bottom jeans
[2:27:50] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> it's REALLY good drefizz lol
[2:27:53] <leith_aziz> This theme is Heavy-Daze pickyVibing
[2:28:07] <DSD24> These hands
[2:28:08] <velgaduere> @huskarl_zap idk what that's in reference to but it sounds awful
[2:28:13] <drefizz> So far HC's theme is my favorite cause its a mood
[2:28:26] <+Shishi1205> mini faust lmao
[2:28:42] <leith_aziz> @drefizz HC is one of my favorites as well. It's really interesting to analyse with context
[2:28:49] <%townzzzzz> mogu mogu
[2:28:56] <DSD24> Nah
[2:28:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:29:00] <%townzzzzz> STAB'D
[2:29:02] <Mach5Mike> NOOOOO
[2:29:04] <%Irridium> yep LUL
[2:29:05] <DSD24> Afro for you Baiken
[2:29:05] <leith_aziz> Armor-Clad Faith is probably my favorite Strive song at the moment
[2:29:05] <zenith0111> LMAOOOO
[2:29:05] <Ai_VS> gun is not invincible LUL
[2:29:05] <%Rasheedt> woolieSHOOKREG
[2:29:09] <xerotwo> STAB BEATS GUN
[2:29:13] <Saltmeisterr> poke
[2:29:36] <drefizz> thats kinda what I like about Strive's music, I usually analyze it while I listen, its why Faust's theme kinda brings a tear to my eye cause it sounds like hes dying
[2:29:39] <+Bin_VV> Scalpel > Gun
[2:29:56] <user_naim> Faust just plugged the barrel lol
[2:30:20] <DSD24> Faust looks like he's dying
[2:30:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:30:42] <zenith0111> Faust died a long time ago...
[2:30:48] <zenith0111> (Emotionall/
[2:30:53] <leith_aziz> @drefizz I've done that with all Strive songs. I like looking at the comments and their interpretation. Songs are a form of storytelling, and a lot of Strive songs have a lot to say pickyLurk
[2:30:56] <huskarl_zap> üÖ±Ô∏èORE mpreg
[2:31:02] <drefizz> Alone Infection legit made me worry about Faust's health
[2:31:17] <drefizz> I've never had a song do that til strive
[2:31:21] <leith_aziz> Armor-Clad Faith nearly made me tear up for Pot. Music is powerfull, man
[2:31:33] <zenith0111> Is that a MF jojo reference?
[2:31:39] <xerotwo> S P E E D W A G O N
[2:31:54] <+Shishi1205> 2h has to be good in this mu
[2:31:56] <DSD24> This should be good for Baiken right?
[2:31:59] <drefizz> put a rope on that boy
[2:32:10] <%SirGO0SE> got a lil party goin on in the back of the line
[2:32:12] <user_naim> Also shoutout to Strive having music from the old games too. Don‚Äôt have to buy that or anything
[2:32:23] <DSD24> If she gets that tether then Axl can't do keep away right?
[2:32:25] <user_naim> so much value
[2:32:26] <leith_aziz> Meanwhile, Axl's is a nice "coming with terms with your situation" song
[2:32:28] <xerotwo> This looks rough LUL
[2:32:33] <zenith0111> @user_naim GG always been good about keeping all its songs
[2:32:45] <leith_aziz> @user_naim Buy? Dont tell me games do that?
[2:32:52] <@Menitta> Ah figured it out. I got a new 4k monitor and since i was playing in 4k, that was causing the slowdown
[2:32:55] <@Menitta> My bad!
[2:33:01] <%townzzzzz> if only she had her gun move from xrd to help
[2:33:02] <DSD24> Damn
[2:33:03] <%Irridium> always fun matching with people as axl and they immediately dip
[2:33:04] <leith_aziz> Ah. Dont play in 4K please
[2:33:07] <%SirGO0SE> wow someone in chat said that too @Menitta
[2:33:09] <DSD24> 4k causing issues
[2:33:11] <huskarl_zap> the British cannot beat GUN
[2:33:15] <@Menitta> thats unfortunate
[2:33:15] <chillygreem> Tether?
[2:33:22] <drefizz> BRI'ISH?
[2:33:25] <+Demoli_PT> dash block, and once you're in STAY in
[2:33:27] <user_naim> @leith_aziz what do you have on Giovanna‚Äôs theme, btw? I always just vibe to it without really understanding
[2:33:32] <+Shishi1205> 4k & strive is not a good conbi
[2:33:42] <@Menitta> should be able to use the resolution supported but w/e
[2:33:44] <huskarl_zap> what Bloodborne enemy is this?
[2:33:57] <zenith0111> I love how most pros get the most elite computers but still put settings on minimal for optimization
[2:34:01] <+Shishi1205> @huskarl_zap the fishman with the chain
[2:34:23] <leith_aziz> @user_naim Giovanna accepts that she's basically an attack dog blindly taking orders. She's lazy, but she's content with where she is.
[2:34:41] <user_naim> @leith_aziz that‚Äôs about the vibe i got. love it
[2:34:57] <%townzzzzz> the keep away is strong

[2:35:06] <zenith0111> Zoning pain NotLikeThis
[2:35:06] <leith_aziz> This is like my hobby. I love getting more out of my games
[2:35:12] <+Demoli_PT> tough mu
[2:35:14] <+AzureInTheDark> God I love Axl
[2:35:22] <+ZackSkyy> @AzureInTheDark why?
[2:35:24] <drefizz> nah theres ways to get in on that boi
[2:35:26] <%Irridium> Kappa
[2:35:37] <+AzureInTheDark> Man is a salt generator.
[2:35:40] <leith_aziz> I love Axl as a character. Zoning of course is my kryptonite
[2:35:48] <DSD24> Sol Dadguy
[2:35:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, first Sol
[2:35:56] <+AzureInTheDark> That and his outfit in this game is cool
[2:35:56] <%Irridium> shoutout to the group behind this blue nago in the lobby
[2:35:58] <leith_aziz> My main pickyPog
[2:35:59] <BR0Speedwagon> ggwp
[2:36:00] <mortificent> HONEST CHARACTER
[2:36:05] <drefizz> apparently Baiken is scaring sol mains from what I've heard
[2:36:08] <+ar4ndomblackguy> H O N E S T
[2:36:09] <+LCGOV> dont worry woolie i will give you a win
[2:36:20] <leith_aziz> @drefizz Parry I assume? That and she can bug the game
[2:36:21] <BR0Speedwagon> Axl Low is the most honest character.
[2:36:21] <%SirGO0SE> @Irridium someone is stinky in there
[2:36:24] <user_naim> Saw that parry freeze Sol on the GG reddit
[2:36:25] <zenith0111> @drefizz Her parry shuts down fake strings
[2:36:26] <+Shishi1205> lmao gold bursting
[2:36:27] <+ar4ndomblackguy> TIME FOR UNGA
[2:36:27] <BR0Speedwagon> Just get close :)
[2:36:30] <mortificent> yooooo I-No's Theme is SO GOOD
[2:36:33] <leith_aziz> Run up Gold Burst? He IS a SOl main!
[2:36:37] <leith_aziz> pickyPog
[2:36:38] <vingadivo> this collor makes it seem like sol is going through a mid life crisis
[2:36:45] <+VVardy> Tethering to Sol doesn't seem like a good idea
[2:36:55] <maubpp> is it just me or is Happy Chaos zoning much more interesting to watch than Axl zoning?
[2:36:58] <leith_aziz> @mortificent I-No's theme is melancholic and depressing, but in a good way
[2:37:05] <drefizz> @maubpp it def is
[2:37:11] <+Shishi1205> @maubpp its harder to do too
[2:37:13] <%Javaa01> @VVardy Fighting Sol, but you're always in grab range
[2:37:17] <leith_aziz> @maubpp Happy Chaos zoning is more interesting likely because there's more to manage
[2:37:19] <drefizz> cause HC does wacky and nutsy stuff
[2:37:27] <leith_aziz> He has 2 seperate meters to manage
[2:37:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:37:31] <DSD24> Yooo
[2:37:34] <zenith0111> Thats literally the first time I seen someone say HC zoning looks fun
[2:37:41] <zenith0111> HC zoning is super boring
[2:37:56] <leith_aziz> I watch enough DEB, so I find it interesting
[2:37:57] <drefizz> HC rushdown is fun to watch
[2:38:01] <%SirGO0SE> reggie been watching his WIK's
[2:38:08] <+oktober212> how do you do that move where baiken goes through the other character?
[2:38:10] <drefizz> DEB is crazy with HC
[2:38:11] <vingadivo> landind that parry is some straight serotonin
[2:38:14] <user_naim> Oh yeah Deb would put in some work
[2:38:21] <zenith0111> HC also got bugged/nerfed so now DEB has to relearn hik
[2:38:23] <+Shishi1205> the bovine with the none
[2:38:25] <user_naim> I haven‚Äôt even seen it yet, but i can imagine
[2:38:25] <leith_aziz> @user_naim DEB mains Chaos
[2:38:42] <+Brassnarwhal> the handcuff thing is so cool
[2:38:43] <+Shishi1205> *nine
[2:38:51] <drefizz> DEB still uses Sol in tournies thou right?
[2:38:56] <DSD24> Tatami Mat that Bandit Bringer
[2:39:00] <user_naim> I gotta watch that set between DEB and Sajam
[2:39:03] <zenith0111> DEB doesnt really do tournaments lately
[2:39:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @oktober212 it's a close kabari with the followup
[2:39:13] <maubpp> the amount of execution required to get good with Happy Chaos is why I respect it more than Axl's. watching DEB play is magical lol
[2:39:17] <%SirGO0SE> @zenith0111 nlbc was her first in awhile
[2:39:30] <leith_aziz> @drefizz Not anymore from what I've seen. It's all about teh character with the playstyle she likes the most. She used to main Johnny before playing Sol. in Xrd, Sol's her main
[2:40:30] <leith_aziz> Sol's so fun to play. Of course, im probably being biased seeing as he's my main
[2:40:31] <BR0Speedwagon> Oh by the way, the moment I stopped moving in the Axl match was because my controller disconnected momentarily. Held it the wrong way.
[2:40:49] <+oktober212> @kosorsomesaykosm_ THANK YOU!
[2:41:07] <leith_aziz> LETS GO

[2:52:13] <+Demoli_PT> mm this guy mashes 2p a lot
[2:52:17] <drefizz> apparently Nago wants to learn from her
[2:52:20] <leith_aziz> @xxHungryxx Nago's art shows that teh mask was originally Red
[2:52:21] <TrashMammalVEVO> @leith_aziz they talk a little in arcade mode
[2:52:27] <leith_aziz> @TrashMammalVEVO I played it
[2:52:30] <leith_aziz> No worrry
[2:52:31] <DSD24> Nago never fought a blade like Baikens before
[2:52:31] <@Menitta> when the chef overcooks your steak: "WELL DONE. HOW DARE YOU"
[2:52:38] <leith_aziz> SAYONARAAA
[2:52:39] <vingadivo> this stage specifically fucks with my integrated graphics to the point where I can't even play lol

[2:53:03] <vingadivo> samurai on samurai violence
[2:53:12] <leith_aziz> This rap section slaps

[2:53:28] <KissTheChaos> just shoot him EZ
[2:53:28] <drefizz> in the wein
[2:53:29] <leith_aziz> That was dishonorable! D:
[2:53:30] <Mach5Mike> HAHAHAHA
[2:53:32] <+Demoli_PT> hesitation is defeat nagoriyuki
[2:53:36] <DSD24> Nago was like "That was a good shot"
[2:53:43] <user_naim> The stage lag brings the true SamSho experience
[2:53:43] <+yeknomlive> maybe mitsurugi had a point
[2:53:44] <+CryptusMaximus> Nago, once again killed by Nago
[2:53:53] <xxHungryxx> It's neat how Baiken started as a secret boss character
[2:54:00] <vingadivo> nago diyng to his own blood gauge as usual
[2:54:18] <DSD24> Ohhhh

[2:54:28] <leith_aziz> In the first days of Strive, it was common for Nago players to get into bloodrage and lose the match
[2:54:32] <%SirGO0SE> Now you see me, now I'm dead :)
[2:54:35] <drefizz> "I smell your fear"
[2:54:41] <+Shishi1205> wall splatted baiken looks hilarious
[2:54:43] <+Bin_VV> How many round kills with gun now LUL
[2:54:49] <vingadivo> @leith_aziz it probably still is lol
[2:54:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> damn, P huh
[2:55:04] <leith_aziz> Nago's playing too old-fashioned to his own detriment, Vampiric abilities aside. cohhHmm
[2:55:24] <vingadivo> you claim to be a samurai, but mostly uses GUN, curious.
[2:55:34] <leith_aziz> Jokes aside, this character's so f*cking cool
[2:55:35] <+Demoli_PT> 4 rounds 4 guns
[2:55:38] <urei_yozora> ohh nice
[2:55:44] <Jontman42> the gun is good
[2:56:07] <brothbowl> didnt samurai try to have the most up-to-date tech in the time they existed?
[2:56:07] <kikoeru_san> sometimes you gotta just pull out the gat
[2:56:08] <user_naim> the G in GG stands for Gun, twice
[2:56:09] <leith_aziz> From design, music, lore, gameplay. Nago's sp dope
[2:56:13] <brothbowl> baiken with a gun makes sense

[3:00:42] <Quikanims> @Quikanims yeah, the most reliable fgc source Kappa
[3:00:49] <+LCGOV> @DSD24 Ram has some of the best colours in the game imo

[3:01:08] <+Demoli_PT> yeah he isn't bad
[3:01:12] <+Demoli_PT> but he's very weak atm

[3:57:00] <user_naim> they‚Äôre right
[3:57:05] <vingadivo> i know dolphins do that but bruh.
[3:57:06] <DedlokPM> @KillerFlow Pretty sure Woolie did it at the end of Round 1 of match 2
[3:57:16] <%SirGO0SE> i think thats the route now yeah
[3:57:36] <%SirGO0SE> combo mode is going to be the first thing i scroll to when i open the game now i think
[3:57:39] <+LCGOV> i always found the best way to be jumping right into it
[3:57:50] <+LCGOV> rip it off like a bandaid
[3:58:02] <+Superbro64> Soul Calibur (and maybe sfv?) are the only games right now that have character specific ranks that effect matchmaking
[3:58:10] <+Superbro64> more fighters should do it tbh
[3:58:16] <user_naim> Yeah I bet a lot of us are rusty. I‚Äôve had a bunch of rusty matches ln floors 8‚Äì10 today
[3:58:19] <SaiyanShoto> I haven‚Äôt played in months also and now I‚Äôm back in trying to learn Baiken and loving it
[3:58:36] <vingadivo> he's an axl main, he's used to kt
[3:58:42] <SpookyBeef7> Servers are borking up because they never bothered to fix anything and a lot of people are trying to mess with Baiken.
[3:58:45] <+MonocleGrizzly> Yup best way to get back into a game is just to play. The strive lobby makes it easy and fun too
[3:58:48] <user_naim> @vingadivo lol
[3:59:01] <+Maxthetics> Yo there's a really good Vergil Baiken color mod
[3:59:19] <DSD24> Tiem Stop!
[3:59:27] <%SirGO0SE> i do wish the unranked lobbies could be sorted by rank though
[3:59:32] <+Bin_VV> ZA WARUDO
[3:59:32] <user_naim> @maxthetics nice. maximum titty vergil sounds sweet
[3:59:33] <realscottstapp> lmao the little sickle tryna reach you

[4:00:34] <user_naim> thank god we got this match
[4:00:35] <+KillerFlow> @DedlokPM guess I was just expecting a bit much. compared to the rest of the cast seemed under whelming
[4:00:38] <+LCGOV> line got big again lol
[4:01:42] <+Parrish_broadnax> the tether was for him
[4:01:43] <+Parrish_broadnax> not for yyou
[4:02:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> axl can throw hands
[4:02:17] <%SirGO0SE> lets go @Bin_VV sajamVibe
[4:02:50] <%SirGO0SE> woolie wants to catch that rekka so bad LUL
[4:03:19] <%SirGO0SE> i was trying to bait it in our game and then dash up throw but idk if the timing works out
[4:03:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:03:50] <%SirGO0SE> oh you can just duck it?!
[4:03:53] <%SirGO0SE> WOW
[4:04:03] <+KillerFlow> the best tether comment I saw was "baiken tether combos are going to be sick. and I mean the rest of the cast comboing baiken
[4:04:31] <%SirGO0SE> oh man that was such a good burst block
[4:04:41] <%emptyantics> Gotdamn
[4:05:17] <%SirGO0SE> Bin is cracked
[4:05:21] <user_naim> nice
[4:05:45] <%emptyantics> Ram has too much mixup game
[4:05:47] <orkaboi> im stealing some stuff from bin
[4:05:49] <Mattais88> I love Ram
[4:05:50] <user_naim> intelligent ram is scary shit
[4:05:55] <+Bin_VV> ggs @WoolieVersus
[4:05:58] <%SirGO0SE> the whole playbook yo @orkaboi
[4:06:09] <%Zero_Jacks> is that RunTheSet BinVV
[4:06:09] <user_naim> good work @bin_vv
[4:06:15] <orkaboi> this is yours? this is mine
[4:06:26] <%SirGO0SE> @Bin_VV did you just duck the gun or was it the 2k that made it miss?
[4:06:38] <+Bin_VV> @user_naim thanks
[4:07:04] <+Bin_VV> @SirGO0SE it definitely was the 2k that made me duck yeah
[4:07:32] <%SirGO0SE> thats good tech, avoids the stagger from it completely
[4:07:41] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Gunshot is a pretty high projectile before the explosion, I 6p'd it once yesterday while playing lol
[4:07:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> confidence
[4:07:56] <+KillerFlow> just socked eddie
[4:08:12] <+added_os> LET'S GO
[4:08:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[4:08:40] <drefizz> so just tried her in training for the first time, as a noob, she feels fun but since I haven't played in a bit, my hand hurts LUL
[4:08:43] <user_naim> I bet Gio‚Äôs 2D is gonna me well too
[4:08:49] <user_naim> do me well*
[4:08:56] <+KillerFlow> he tryed to fly but you tyed him down
[4:09:06] <%SirGO0SE> its nice that all her specials are the same direction @drefizz
[4:09:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> hahaha
[4:09:32] <%SirGO0SE> on the hands i mean
[4:09:47] <+CryptusMaximus> He should try experimenting with 6HS a lot more.
[4:10:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> eddie with the pass
[4:10:21] <+Freelance7> How's Baiken?
[4:10:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:10:22] <drefizz> VANISH INTO DAAAAARK
[4:11:23] <Ragnorok64> has Baiken always sounded this horse? Is this JP audio?
[4:11:38] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Yeah pretty much lol
[4:11:39] <+KillerFlow> with baiken the reflected model is vary noticable. she switches sides and so des her arm LUL
[4:12:04] <%emptyantics> Not a fan of reflective models
[4:12:17] <user_naim> oro tech
[4:12:20] <+CryptusMaximus> yeah even Baiken's english va is a raspy gal
[4:12:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> OSFrog
[4:12:30] <+Crunchy_the_clown> all that smoking
[4:12:34] <drefizz> this is Jp va
[4:12:38] <forumbug74> BLAM
[4:12:38] <Ragnorok64> @KillerFlow Just tells you how important readability is in 2D games
[4:12:45] <user_naim> Baiken‚Äôs Korean VO was less hoarse, I think.
[4:12:51] <Ragnorok64> aside from NRS and their stance switch button
[4:12:52] <user_naim> But still good
[4:13:31] <user_naim> k-dub gio is great btw
[4:13:38] <+LCGOV> i love this stage simply for the giant baddass statues in the background
[4:13:43] <Ragnorok64> character silhouettes should be the same from either side even if it means their arms change
[4:14:00] <+MonocleGrizzly> Yup
[4:14:13] <SofterCrash> 6p the jump S
[4:14:14] <+MyooMyoo> I think things like jS would be harder to see if her model changed
[4:14:15] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> baikens english va is nico from dmc 5 from what I hear which is cool
[4:14:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> the samurai and the samurai please
[4:14:35] <NotHereToStream> baiken is just oro then Kappa
[4:14:45] <+MonocleGrizzly> I know baiken‚Äôs eng va is sylvanas
[4:15:06] <+CryptusMaximus> jump S into GGs
[4:15:20] <drefizz> Baiken va isn't Nico
[4:15:24] <drefizz> in english
[4:15:28] <+Superbro64> This is just me, but most Axl's I find are pretty proficient at GG as a whole
[4:15:42] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> oh it's not? my b lol
[4:15:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:16:00] <zenith0111> 666 viewers SeemsGood
[4:16:06] <+LCGOV> the most optimal way to beat the axl matchup is to not play them
[4:16:09] <%SirGO0SE> ive heard sylvanas nico and the chick from apex legends but all three of those characters have different VA's LUL
[4:16:12] <drefizz> Faye Kingslee is Nico, Baiken is Patty Mattson
[4:16:26] <%SirGO0SE> oh Patty Mattson is Sylvanas
[4:16:34] <drefizz> shes Sylvanas yah
[4:16:52] <+KillerFlow> baiken might be the one dlc I'll buy. her mid screen seems really good.
[4:17:29] <zenith0111> The Axl grind NotLikeThis
[4:17:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1486261185653657607?t=TY33I0sz3hRhHS78nrxA2g&s=19

[4:17:52] <%SirGO0SE> sajamVibe gg @Irridium
[4:17:53] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> That's pretty much me now lol
[4:17:59] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah learning to land those enders is always key
[4:18:07] <Ragnorok64> Where's all the Baiken Nago fanarts?
[4:18:11] <user_naim> I barely know her

[4:18:59] <user_naim> big poise for pot bois

[4:19:06] <+penjaza> Nice
[4:19:08] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> SHOOT HIM

[4:20:19] <Ragnorok64> Does Baiken use one of the Outrages or anything or is she just that tough, in universe?
[4:20:25] <+MonocleGrizzly> With Anji and Baiken finally in a game again, I‚Äôm even more disappointed at the lack unique match dialogue
[4:20:31] <+LCGOV> Baiken keeps the safety off
[4:20:39] <+LCGOV> Safety ALWAYS OFF
[4:20:56] <+gantz_zero> i don't think there's even more than one known outrage used by literally anyone other than sol currently @Ragnorok64
[4:20:58] <+MidnightBasker> She modded her gun to NOT have a safety
[4:21:24] <Ragnorok64> @gantz_zero Isn't Anji using one?
[4:21:27] <+MonocleGrizzly> LETS GOO
[4:21:40] <+vsrobojoe892> her tatami eats floor projectiles too right? I've seen it at least eat Leo's

[4:25:03] <Ragnorok64> If Pot buster is used with the opponent at high enough HP does it blow through Guts or does Guts always apply?

[4:25:29] <+Demoli_PT> oh damn woolie still going

[4:26:16] <MOON__MIST> damn nice pressure
[4:26:22] <+gantz_zero> yeah but woman with sword tho
[4:26:23] <user_naim> Baiken is the first strand type dlc
[4:26:36] <Afrosamasenpai> @Ragnorok64 It blows through
[4:26:50] <+gantz_zero> @user_naim i...don't know how this is the first time i'm seeing that
[4:26:58] <Ragnorok64> interesting
[4:27:01] <user_naim> me neither tbh
[4:27:22] <+KillerFlow> baiken might have really good anti DP pressure with the hook

[4:29:54] <+LCGOV> i panicked LOL

[4:30:31] <@Moobot> @Solidus_113 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 44 minutes

[4:31:30] <user_naim> Getting nice variety today
[4:31:50] <user_naim> no Gios though, but I guess we‚Äôre all stuck on floor 8 lol

[4:32:08] <+gantz_zero> it literally has proximity grenades
[4:32:21] <+MonocleGrizzly> I didn‚Äôt see any Sols on floor 7 yesterday
[4:32:23] <SpookyBeef7> XD
[4:33:11] <+CryptusMaximus> @MonocleGrizzly prolly cause they're all still getting carried to 10 or higher LUL
[4:33:19] <%JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[4:33:32] <+gantz_zero> @Ragnorok64 part of me wants to say it's from Isuka
[4:33:37] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:33:39] <+CryptusMaximus> This salt bought to you by an I-No main
[4:33:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> faust is just a cuphead boss
[4:34:01] <Ragnorok64> Afro Baiken about to awaken something
[4:34:12] <SpookyBeef7> Oof, that's a rough one for me. GG!!
[4:35:07] <+CryptusMaximus> what is a samurai against a british man with a long chain?
[4:35:19] <+gantz_zero> a fight
[4:35:23] <%townzzzzz> one day them stations will be clean
[4:35:33] <+Superbro64> I do not think they'll EVER fix it
[4:35:42] <+LCGOV> as much as i like this game they really botched the online lobby system
[4:35:49] <+LCGOV> its so counter intuitive
[4:36:00] <+gantz_zero> @Ragnorok64 got it, it was Push a Bush from Isuka OST
[4:36:00] <SpookyBeef7> @townzzzzz If ArcSys hasn't bothered to fix them after multiple betas and a year of release, they never will.
[4:36:06] <+Superbro64> arcsys lobby station issues have been an issue since several v
[4:36:09] <+KillerFlow> whats dirty station?
[4:36:12] <+Superbro64> -games ago*
[4:36:41] <+CryptusMaximus> @KillerFlow The versus stations you stand at have a tendency to break and not match you up with people properly
[4:36:51] <Ragnorok64> @Ragnorok64 üëç Just didn't recognize it at all
[4:36:54] <+CryptusMaximus> You can usually just fix it by moving to a different one
[4:37:10] <+KillerFlow> oh just didn't know the term thanks
[4:37:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> burst is free zoning
[4:37:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> it's not like you're gonna get in again
[4:38:34] <+CryptusMaximus> I hope Axl runs out and grabs some more McDonalds in the middle of this desert.
[4:38:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> that'd be a good taunt

[4:39:25] <+CryptusMaximus> we got an axl win on the board
[4:39:31] <+KillerFlow> her super doesnt have invincibility?
[4:40:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> DO IT
[4:40:16] <Ragnorok64> So where did Goldlewis end up tier-wise?
[4:40:35] <+gantz_zero> @CryptusMaximus i kind of want super taunts that spend meter to do something stupid like that. axl does a real One Vision but uses the entirety of it to disappear and reappear with food
[4:40:47] <%Irridium> @Ragnorok64 patches helped but he's still pretty low
[4:41:07] <Ragnorok64> @Irridium BibleThump
[4:41:16] <+CryptusMaximus> @gantz_zero Imagine the balls to use such a super and still win
[4:41:18] <SofterCrash> GGs
[4:41:26] <+CryptusMaximus> *such a taunt I should say
[4:41:49] <+gantz_zero> @CryptusMaximus exactly. and the style points to use it mid combo lol
[4:43:12] <+KillerFlow> 5h just teleported zato into the ground LUL damn
[4:44:05] <Bullethead1010> Is this a re-run of Heaven or He'll starring Woolie Madden?
[4:44:25] <+LCGOV> oh shit i forgot the royal rumble is starting in 5 minutes
[4:45:33] <kojanga> gg
[4:45:47] <+Parrish_broadnax> I thought she looked friendly
[4:45:52] <%townzzzzz> a mirror
[4:45:52] <+Parrish_broadnax> and then I tried her and ran back to Gio
[4:45:59] <+Superbro64> I think the movelist of like 6-ish specials look simple enough
[4:46:08] <+BignanasTheGawd> i think she looks easy, compared to other DLC chars
[4:46:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1486261185653657607?t=TY33I0sz3hRhHS78nrxA2g&s=19
[4:46:13] <Phrickshun> I am garbage trash at fighting games, Baiken "looks" easier than all the other DLC, man...
[4:46:22] <+CryptusMaximus> I'll be honest, her combos are easy to start but hard af to end.
[4:46:42] <+Superbro64> Plus her tether mechanic is there, but it's ignorable. You cant really ignore Jackos or Happy Chaos character specific mechanics
[4:46:53] <+CryptusMaximus> It's like the first two or three hits are free then it becomes execution hell.
[4:47:29] <+gantz_zero> her VO is so fucking good though
[4:47:46] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus nah reggie, if you just throw shit as chipp you'll be smoked, all his shit is negative and you get blown up super easily
[4:48:16] <%townzzzzz> volcanic VIPPPPPPER
[4:48:20] <+LCGOV> baikens va is top tier
[4:48:20] <SofterCrash> ZEN
[4:48:26] <+KillerFlow> i've had her theme on repeat for the last two days
[4:48:48] <+LCGOV> they knocked it out the park with her theme
[4:48:49] <+KillerFlow> for me her ost is the best in the game
[4:49:06] <+CryptusMaximus> But what if something hits tho?
[4:49:15] <+Demoli_PT> gotta defend my boy, he's work man
[4:49:19] <+LCGOV> my buddies who don't play fighting games have been into strive just because of the ost
[4:49:21] <+Paradoxfiasco> Man I love watchign a good fighting game, but get far too anxious to play them online

[4:50:49] <+KillerFlow> chipp is a machine gun. just spray and pray. as a chip player tis a fact of life LUL
[4:50:57] <+Superbro64> "You see, the difference in us chipp mains, is that we throw things out KNOWING we can die. It makes us throw things out FASTER"
[4:51:27] <+Demoli_PT> the thing about chipp is more about the movement than actually throwing shit out, thats why you see chipps backdashing a lot
[4:51:29] <+gantz_zero> @Paradoxfiasco you and me both. i bought the game on launch and haven't really even done anything with it outside of watching the story :/
[4:51:31] <SofterCrash> but what do chipp mains fear?
