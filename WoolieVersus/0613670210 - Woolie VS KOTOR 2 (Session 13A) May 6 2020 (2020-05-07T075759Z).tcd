[0:01:45] <%DatAsuna> People beg for lucas back, but HE THREW IT OUT
[0:01:53] <+slamzalid> Welcome Back Again Dudes!! :D <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:02:01] <+tearfuldevil> its not confusing?
[0:02:04] <lotharrio> Legends is old EU.
[0:02:06] <+tearfuldevil> eu = legends
[0:02:13] <+SolidusRex> Knights of the Old EU
[0:02:18] <CaptHat211> TBF Lucas was under the impression that they'd follow an outline he provided instead of NO OUTLINE AT ALL.
[0:02:20] <+tearfuldevil> its just a new name
[0:02:25] <%DatAsuna> @tearknack there's a new EU tho
[0:02:37] <haitakaa> but rebels doe
[0:02:39] <%eyezehuhh> psaCrazyhead
[0:02:40] <+tearfuldevil> @DatAsuna ah, fair
[0:02:42] <%xcompleasedad> The most right anyone has ever been.
[0:02:44] <+SolidusRex> Bad Batch was good though
[0:02:46] <%DatAsuna> also tbf saying it has filler doesn't mean the filler is bad
[0:02:47] <%Jetzord> I dunno man, the first four episodes were good
[0:02:48] <+zanzibar_junker> People are calling FF7R2 the next Endgame, fuck that noise
[0:02:50] <%DatAsuna> SOME of the filler is good
[0:02:51] <%Grayhammatter> paunching
[0:02:53] <+tearfuldevil> Gendy clone wars is the only one i've seen
[0:02:56] <%Gruhunchously> pouching
[0:02:59] <%Pillagius> To be doubly fair it's same as Ridley Scott wasn't the only one who made the Alien movies so awesome - Geourge Lucas wasn't the only one who made Star Wars so awesome as well
[0:03:02] <%DatAsuna> FF7's best chapter is filler
[0:03:04] <haitakaa> that Mace Window fight
[0:03:26] <%Slimshazbot> Gendy Wars was soooo goooooooood
[0:03:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:03:30] <%Pillagius> Like Lucas isn't singlehandedly responsible for franchise greatness
[0:03:31] <available_line> Mace Window lol
[0:03:34] <CaptHat211> Gendy's Star Wars was pretty good, but the Jedi were too OP. General Grievous was great though.
[0:03:41] <+tearfuldevil> @zanzibar_junker i am so sick of the MCU and its idiot normie fans, fucking god
[0:03:43] <ashenjuan25> Gendy grevious isn’t best grevious
[0:03:44] <%Gruhunchously> General Grevous is like the friggin' Terminator in that show
[0:03:46] <ashenjuan25> Is*
[0:03:48] <Dangerzone979> Is the audio super low for anyone else?
[0:03:53] <+zanzibar_junker> I hate mcu
[0:03:54] <+tearfuldevil> SAME, WOOLIE
[0:03:56] <+eanscrale> auuuuugggghhhhh off
[0:04:00] <%Slimshazbot> I fell into that trap too
[0:04:05] <%eyezehuhh> HSWP woolieREMEMBERS
[0:04:07] <+Invlux> @pillagius it's almost as if people don't get that movies are a collaborative effort and can't be only attributed to a single person
[0:04:14] <%DatAsuna> tbf the movie is also the worst part
[0:04:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Naruto>Clone Wars?
[0:04:15] <%Gruhunchously> Akshuly
[0:04:16] <+tearfuldevil> @zanzibar_junker i like thor ragnarok, black panther, and Iron Man 1 and 2
[0:04:23] <%Grayhammatter> the movie was pretty bad
[0:04:26] <ashenjuan25> Trash > naruto
[0:04:30] <lotharrio> Lucas was like... only about 30% of what made Star Wars good. And half of that is stuff he took from Spaghetti Westerns and Japanese samurai films.
[0:04:31] <CaptHat211> Dave Filoni salvaged the world of the Prequels which I thought was impossible.
[0:04:32] <+prime_name> That movie was the worst sell for the show.
[0:04:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Trash>Naruto>Clone Wars?
[0:04:40] <liljojofett> THAT WAS THE WRONG READ
[0:04:42] <haitakaa> Yoda vs count deku was cool
[0:04:42] <%xcompleasedad> The movie was that stupid shit where the pilot for a show is a dumb movie.
[0:04:54] <+tearfuldevil> fact of the day, Gendy Ttartovsky did storyboarding for Iron Man 1 and 2
[0:04:54] <%DatAsuna> @CaptHat211 there was a lot of good legends prequels era too
[0:04:57] <phatmac16> I get you Woolie
[0:04:58] <Shinny1338> HunterXHunter
[0:05:03] <%eyezehuhh> in the spirit of the recent death battle: Kakashi vs Obi Wan who would win
[0:05:05] <+zanzibar_junker> the Spiderman Clone Wars is worse than SW Clone Wars
[0:05:09] <%ECRead> Genndy Greivous is best Grevious
[0:05:09] <+eanscrale> Dude NO ONE liked clone wars back then
[0:05:11] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Grow from the garbage
[0:05:14] <CaptHat211> @DatAsuna Absolutely.
[0:05:22] <phatmac16> One guy
[0:05:25] <+tearfuldevil> @zanzibar_junker what a controversial take lol
[0:05:26] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Use the garbage as nutrients
[0:05:27] <%Pillagius> @Invlux yea
[0:05:27] <ashenjuan25> Yo Spider-Man clone saga is so dumb it gets funny
[0:05:33] <%CursedNobleman> @eyezehuhh madara
[0:05:36] <%DatAsuna> They told him on telos station
[0:05:49] <lotharrio> Spider-Man Clone Saga: Wait, what even ARE clones?

[0:06:24] <+prime_name> I think the latest retcon is that he just uses the armor.
[0:06:25] <+tearfuldevil> BLEGH
[0:06:25] <lotharrio> Just like when they brought back Doc Ock: The internet and virtual reality are just magic, right?
[0:06:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> Sigh...

[0:12:55] <+jake5713> Bottoms of my feet are calloused from being barefoot 24/7.
[0:13:05] <lotharrio> I sliced off part of a fingertip but managed to save it by being real quick with bandaging and stitches. Still thought I lost nerves in it for like two weeks after.
[0:13:29] <%DatAsuna> Why is it censored ingman?
[0:13:41] <thequickbrownrabbit> could be worse i saw a guy sand all his fingers off cleaning a disk sander

[0:23:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Star Wars Christmas Special>Naruto?
[0:23:28] <%Gruhunchously> I thought they did.
[0:23:29] <+tearfuldevil> wrong lol

[0:23:41] <vulkan_vibes> is his secret room restored content?

[0:24:05] <+oda_flobunaga> Fett had a cut scene in the first film
[0:24:08] <vulkan_vibes> there are two iirc
[0:24:18] <+oda_flobunaga> It got put back in in the 90s

[0:24:37] <+tearfuldevil> the jedi code was mentioned in the phantom meance
[0:24:37] <+oda_flobunaga> right
[0:24:42] <lotharrio> Misconception, @oda_flobunaga The original didn't include Boba, unless I'm entirely incorrect.
[0:24:46] <%Gruhunchously> We could roll with the OG squad, HK and [REDACTED]

[0:24:51] <Jay444111> Hey guys. How ya doing today?
[0:25:11] <vulkan_vibes> HK and redacted are perfect for iziz

[0:25:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Inb4 YeYeYe for Redacted Joining
[0:25:44] <lotharrio> I mean in the sense that Boba was digitally inserted, just like how the original Jabba actor was painted over with a slug-man.
[0:25:45] <+tearfuldevil> the first line of the JEdi Code is actually way older than kotor, and the prequels
[0:25:49] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia's standing right behind you
[0:25:50] <vulkan_vibes> the original filmed version is a myth
[0:25:52] <thequickbrownrabbit> kriea needed you to leave so she could update her only fans
[0:26:06] <+tearfuldevil> the first line of the code was in Heir to the Empire
[0:26:35] <vulkan_vibes> oh god those books are so good
[0:26:37] <%DatAsuna> I heard vaklu has an 8 pack
[0:26:39] <+oda_flobunaga> Kreia's onlyfans videos show up in that WKYK great Grandma's sketch

[0:27:04] <%DatAsuna> This is also all stuff you learned on telos station :P
[0:27:15] <thequickbrownrabbit> are they afraid of the monsters or the sand you know its coarse and gets everywhere

[0:30:42] <+MagicBeanBurrito> what a murder
[0:30:44] <%RioGascar> can you really have sympathy for mandalorians
[0:30:44] <lotharrio> Not for nothing, Star Wars would massively benefit from having like... 5 more groups like the Mandalorians and about 7 more groups of Force Users besides the Jedi and Sith.
[0:30:54] <ValberParadox> Yes @RioGascar
[0:30:57] <%RioGascar> like they kinda bring this on themselves

[0:35:11] <ashenjuan25> Fuck Mira
[0:35:19] <%emperordread> color co-ordination is canon
[0:35:23] <%DatAsuna> Well the canon is blue, but fuck that
[0:35:25] <%DatAsuna> blue is overused
[0:35:30] <zocano> Mira is staying on the ship
[0:35:31] <thequickbrownrabbit> mira who all i hear is not hanhar
[0:35:36] <DSD24> Oh we rolling with the ladies?
[0:35:48] <+Invlux> LET THEM PUNCH
[0:35:56] <CaptHat211> I first saw Force Punching in Gendy's CW series.
[0:36:00] <%RioGascar> i still dont get why people use silver colored sabers
[0:36:00] <ashenjuan25> Mira will never leave that room
[0:36:04] <%hoenhime344> let them use Silat
[0:36:08] <lotharrio> @ValberParadox Probably either waiting for her so she's a good Gun-Jedi, or not bothering with her at all.
[0:36:11] <%hoenhime344> punchy kicky time
[0:36:16] <%DatAsuna> Should have someone with each
[0:36:36] <%RioGascar> Cause if I remember the lore in silver lightsabers is an unstable crystal that was created from losing a loved one or something crazy
[0:36:41] <%Grayhammatter> Vsauce
[0:36:42] <ValberParadox> LUL why the Mira hate?
[0:36:54] <zocano> Cause Mira is ResidentSleeper
[0:37:04] <%Gruhunchously> Visas is really easy to influence.
[0:37:05] <lotharrio> @ValberParadox Didn't like her intro or her attitude in conversations.
[0:37:08] <%hoenhime344> Mira is a jobber
[0:37:08] <ashenjuan25> Mira is woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:37:09] <+oda_flobunaga> Hanhar is Best Waifu
[0:37:11] <%RioGascar> Tho it might be legends now so might not matter at all
[0:37:12] <thequickbrownrabbit> fann walks into a room full of sith When will you learn your actions have consequences!!!
[0:37:13] <Daxalog> I thought the stream ended
[0:37:24] <lotharrio> There's a bit to go with Visas, but you max out influence with her almost instantly just with conversations.
[0:37:27] <%NocturnGamma> You there was some Uchiha force user that needed a silver crystal lol
[0:37:29] <%DatAsuna> @Daxalog just a food break
[0:37:32] <ValberParadox> @RioGascar When you purify a red crystal (which is a corrupted crystal) it becomes silver, that what Ahsoka did.
[0:37:44] <%Grayhammatter> punchy kicks
[0:37:58] <+tearfuldevil> hmm
[0:38:05] <%RioGascar> when did she do this? Since we kinda just see that saber get pulled out
[0:38:05] <lotharrio> Force Attacks are armor proof.
[0:38:09] <+tearfuldevil> i guess i like the new red crystal lore
[0:38:13] <ashenjuan25> I hate how crystals have to be tortured for a red lightsaber
[0:38:14] <+tearfuldevil> its pretty edgy
[0:38:22] <+tearfuldevil> eh, i think its fun
[0:38:23] <%RioGascar> also clone wars s7 really fucking good last 4 episodes
[0:38:33] <%NocturnGamma> Is that canon yet?

[0:38:34] <ValberParadox> @RioGascar Read her book
[0:38:38] <%DatAsuna> I don't hate the new crystal lore I just hate that canon only allows ONE kind of crystal for everything
[0:38:43] <+kewlmyc> LOUD NOISES
[0:38:44] <ashenjuan25> I think the new crystal stuff is dumb
[0:38:44] <%Gruhunchously> Nothing personnel kid
[0:38:46] <%subjectg> I prefer the synthetics honestly, but i’m just indifferent with the new lore
[0:38:47] <thequickbrownrabbit> locks lightsaber crystal in a room with the barney theme for 48 hours boom done
[0:38:52] <+tearfuldevil> @DatAsuna oh, thats kind of lame
[0:38:57] <DSD24> Oh wow this poor Sith
[0:38:58] <%DatAsuna> because it makes red the only colour that can ever be personal
[0:38:59] <Redblood801> What did he say! I can't hear anything due to the lightning!
[0:39:06] <%ChoculaUltra> SQUAD

[0:39:15] <DSD24> Me and the bois about to stab some Sith
[0:39:16] <ashenjuan25> I hate that sith can only have red lightsabers
[0:39:16] <%hoenhime344> this was a SHITTY infiltration attemp
[0:39:19] <%RioGascar> Is there still rainbow colored sabers in the new lore
[0:39:25] <lotharrio> "Nice try, I'm behind 10 Mandos."
[0:39:32] <%RioGascar> that shit made me so made to hear was a thing
[0:39:41] <ValberParadox> The Mandalorians are the weapons.
[0:39:45] <%DatAsuna> poor little sith
[0:39:54] <%Gruhunchously> A mando who isn't prepared to kill in an instant is no Mando
[0:40:01] <lotharrio> You "can" come back, but it's only good for grabbing the items or finishing sidequests if you rushed things.
[0:40:04] <ValberParadox> @ashenjuan25 they don't have to, enter Revan
[0:40:04] <+Estuko> Oh shit I thought this stream would auto play, damn it! I was in middle of a game lol
[0:40:06] <%NocturnGamma> But how else will the children know who the bad man is?

[0:41:12] <alexandrecau> It's ok you have the waifu squad
[0:41:23] <ashenjuan25> There’s only 2 really good movies everything else you have to like despite one or more elements of the movie
[0:41:25] <%Grayhammatter> zap them fools
[0:41:29] <lotharrio> @Go4theKnees The second planet after the two prologues.

[0:42:24] <DSD24> @Bluemanzee Plus we got that extra content in
[0:42:26] <%subjectg> it’s one of the shorter rpgs imo

[0:42:34] <%Gruhunchously> You should really bring HK for this one.

[0:43:24] <Halospaz117> Oh huh, I didn't realize those are most of the characters guaranteed to survive KOTOR 1

[0:43:43] <Projectomicron> so I was told the mando disintegrator was the best pistol
[0:43:44] <%subjectg> Oh you’d better give cando melee this time
[0:43:56] <%a_goth_pancake> carth is SUPER not alive
[0:43:57] <candidateplays> HK
[0:43:59] <memejima> Boy he and Baonetta should get along
[0:43:59] <%Ashenik1> HK
[0:44:00] <%Gruhunchously> Cando and HK, red bois
[0:44:00] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus Cando is a better melee fighter than a gun guy.
[0:44:02] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> HK
[0:44:05] <%Gruhunchously> HK
[0:44:07] <PinkSocks> this game's party is TOO GOOD
[0:44:08] <ValberParadox> Screw Visas LUL
[0:44:09] <+Ixek> HK and Mandalore. HK has Influence to be gained.
[0:44:10] <DSD24> Such a cool problem to have
[0:44:10] <%subjectg> you can literally thrn him into solidus snake in this one
[0:44:12] <snake_zen> HK
[0:44:12] <Zebroneath> There's too many cool guys in your party
[0:44:13] <+MagicBeanBurrito> HK
[0:44:14] <Redblood801> Bring Visas
[0:44:16] <ashenjuan25> Carth being a feral man is totally what happened
[0:44:22] <DSD24> @ValberParadox I mean she is pretty cute
[0:44:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Mando with a Sword Pls
[0:44:25] <ingman112> HK!
[0:44:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @WoolieVersus it may seem strange but Cando is actually way better at melee combat than range
[0:44:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> HK FOR NON-DARK INFLUENCE
[0:44:33] <%DatAsuna> almost as if he's on some kind of performance enhancing stim
[0:44:40] <ValberParadox> If you're not dark side, Handmaiden all the way
[0:44:42] <%TheFabledAble> kreia is an AMAZING choice for this
[0:44:47] <+Bluemanzee> Mira isn't even harming the overall coolness that's how cool everyone else but her is
[0:45:05] <%Grayhammatter> LUL

[0:45:11] <+Zouledge> doodLUL
[0:45:13] <+valkuma> you would rather get rid of the hot waifu

[0:45:16] <+oda_flobunaga> Preach
[0:45:19] <DSD24> When you have a party of 10s a 7 looks bad in comparison
[0:45:19] <%deviljhojho_> DAMN RIGHT
[0:45:21] <ashenjuan25> Yes
[0:45:25] <ashenjuan25> Get rid of her

[0:45:52] <ashenjuan25> Mira: woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:45:54] <ValberParadox> Mira is a badass bounty hunter.
[0:45:58] <+Zyquux> Hanhaar is the Uber suck
[0:45:58] <%DatAsuna> She doesn't consider herself one, but her feelings are complicated

[0:48:54] <memejima> The mythical O-Pass
[0:48:55] <%a_goth_pancake> hello clone wars narrator man/admiral yularen
[0:48:58] <%DatAsuna> he parried your convo
[0:49:02] <jorniev> good questions
[0:49:02] <%TUMZtwitch> Wait...
[0:49:08] <%emperordread> In soviet space russia, party has dialogue quest for you
[0:49:09] <%DatAsuna> During thejedi civil war
[0:49:09] <ThePimpGuin> fucking Mandolore ask you questions!
[0:49:14] <lotharrio> Fought with Revan during the Jedi Civil War.
[0:49:18] <%Gruhunchously> Mandalore asks YOU questions
[0:49:29] <%TUMZtwitch> Is he a planetary representative?!
[0:49:32] <ashenjuan25> Holy shit that is yularen
[0:49:33] <ATPsoldat> 1
[0:49:42] <%DatAsuna> 3 is a carth answer
[0:49:50] <ATPsoldat> No one wants to be a carth
[0:49:54] <lotharrio> "Didn't realize magic was so fucking strong."
[0:50:02] <+evbites> his armor is fantastic
[0:50:12] <+tearfuldevil> wtf is canderous talking about
[0:50:14] <alexandrecau> suth or jedi he can still force push you
[0:50:24] <+tearfuldevil> they totally did fight jedi before
[0:50:29] <steelstwitchaccount> Oh he was red.
[0:50:30] <ThePimpGuin> he was super red but honorable
[0:50:31] <+Estuko> @evbites his armour is so rad I purposely kept him and played as him most of the time once I got him LUL
[0:50:31] <+tearfuldevil> that was the whole thing with exar kun
[0:50:35] <lotharrio> Cando was a practical red.
[0:50:41] <DSD24> He was Red but not a asshole
[0:50:47] <ThePimpGuin> lawful evil
[0:50:51] <%Gruhunchously> @tearknack Yeah, he literally just said that
[0:50:53] <+Bluemanzee> Cando talking about war like "Was it good for you?"
[0:50:58] <%TUMZtwitch> there itis
[0:51:05] <ATPsoldat> Goto seems more like a lawful evil
[0:51:09] <%DatAsuna> Cnado just handwaves exar kun as not counting cause he was too young
[0:51:09] <%emperordread> Didn't he laugh about burning planets?
[0:51:14] <+tearfuldevil> @Gruhunchously yeah but the way he phrased it as "he was already a sith" is bs, cause they had to fight jedi
[0:51:15] <%DatAsuna> Cando just has johns about it
[0:51:16] <Breakfast_Megapowers> I only have a few options of things to watch https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/462113324918636554/707737977400328212/20200506_194030.jpg
[0:51:26] <%RioGascar> i dont think cando would say laugh at someone’s regular misery
[0:51:29] <lotharrio> No-no, in KOTOR there's Red/Blue and Practical/Enthusiastic.
[0:51:32] <candidateplays> 2 is the accurate one
[0:51:35] <steelstwitchaccount> Which is why we Malachor V'd em'
[0:51:37] <+evbites> aww thanks
[0:51:38] <+valiard> hey
[0:51:38] <%subjectg> 2 is my pick
[0:51:40] <%DatAsuna> It really is
[0:51:45] <alexandrecau> Yes yes your dick was big, we still chopped it
[0:51:48] <Klefth> This guy is the shit
[0:51:59] <%DatAsuna> whoops automod
[0:52:01] <thequickbrownrabbit> The jedi order is really just a bunch of karens with 3 people who actually do shit
[0:52:13] <%DatAsuna> Well lucien draay did shit
[0:52:13] <%RioGascar> if they dont engage in a way that makes them a threat or thing for honor i dont see cando as fighting for no reason
[0:52:15] <%DatAsuna> it's just
[0:52:18] <%DatAsuna> he did all the wrong shit
[0:52:20] <lotharrio> ...I mean, maybe. But that would have also required the Mandalorians to wipe out like... half the life in the galaxy.
[0:52:25] <jorniev> yeaaah sure just like the ligeon in fallout new vegas
[0:52:26] <ashenjuan25> Cando is the idealized version of a mandalorian
[0:52:28] <+Invlux> @Breakfast_Megapowers yoo Heavy Metal dvd
[0:52:28] <ValberParadox> I would imagine that if the Mandalorians won, Palpatine would never come to power.
[0:52:36] <steelstwitchaccount> If "Ifs" & "Buts" were Candy & Nuts, we'd all have a Merry Christmas. :P
[0:52:36] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:52:37] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Yeah
[0:52:41] <%DatAsuna> the chiss .etc
[0:52:43] <alexandrecau> they would still have lost to siths
[0:52:44] <lotharrio> Vhong
[0:52:48] <lotharrio> Yuuzhan Vhon.
[0:52:48] <%DatAsuna> Yuuzhan vong
[0:52:49] <DSD24> The what?
[0:52:50] <%Gruhunchously> Yuhzan Vong
[0:52:51] <%CursedNobleman> force kinks
[0:52:51] <+tearfuldevil> the yuzhang vong
[0:52:55] <+captain_history> Yuuzan Vong
[0:52:55] <%DatAsuna> Also they're not from the unknown regions
[0:52:57] <ATPsoldat> Yeah, we would have to deal with Thrawns instead of Sidious.
[0:52:58] <+tearfuldevil> but the vong are from another galaxy
[0:53:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> Sparta is my favorite ancient Greek city-state. Still glad they never fully conquered Greece, for the same reason I'm glad the Mandalorians didn't win.
[0:53:11] <ashenjuan25> The vhong are dumb tho
[0:53:15] <%Gruhunchously> The Mandos would be the Imperium form 40K
[0:53:18] <%DatAsuna> I like the bong on paper
[0:53:18] <ATPsoldat> Warrior culture don't last long
[0:53:25] <+tearfuldevil> eh, i liked the Vong
[0:53:29] <%RioGascar> space sparta would not be able to govern at a galatic level
[0:53:29] <lotharrio> @tearknack They'd presumably see them coming, though... like because they ran out of enemies and would be looking for something to nuke.
[0:53:30] <%DatAsuna> I meant vong but I stand by it
[0:53:33] <%subjectg> i’m of the mind the mandos would be nothing but sith puppets had they won
[0:53:37] <+tearfuldevil> @DatAsuna you like the bong ah
[0:53:51] <thequickbrownrabbit> they got 5 stars space gta style
[0:53:55] <%DatAsuna> I do
[0:53:56] <Exodusprime1256> no John's cando. no johns
[0:53:58] <DSD24> "Our battle will be LEGENDARY"
[0:54:04] <+tearfuldevil> never tried a bong
[0:54:04] <%DatAsuna> But also the vong concept is cool I just hate their aesthetic
[0:54:09] <+jake5713> Vong were dope.
[0:54:11] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Gruhunchously Not quite so xenophobic. It'd be a galactic slave-state.
[0:54:11] <+BlockingDisabled> I think Canderous encountered something from Unknown Space before, remember that story from KotOR 1?
[0:54:12] <+oda_flobunaga> When Kyle Katarn got to fight the Vong, it was pretty awesome
[0:54:18] <+tearfuldevil> oh yeah, the aestehtic is eh
[0:54:18] <thequickbrownrabbit> ncr
[0:54:20] <%RioGascar> like mandolorians aren’t exactly a race that handles diplomacy and politics and things that keep governments stable going
[0:54:22] <%DatAsuna> But going all organic and spacefaring without engines is rad
[0:54:22] <ATPsoldat> See the Empire
[0:54:22] <+tearfuldevil> and i like bdsm lol
[0:54:27] <Klefth> Oh hey, it's south american history in a nutshell
[0:54:31] <+PhantomMiG> Sparta
[0:54:31] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Roman empire
[0:54:36] <%DatAsuna> I like that they basically cruise around like the tyranids do
[0:54:36] <DSD24> See Caesar's Legion
[0:54:37] <steelstwitchaccount> The Galactic Empire under Palps
[0:54:41] <%Chatterbox1991> See the Greater German Reich
[0:54:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> Overextension is just a number Kappa
[0:54:45] <lotharrio> Not a single Mandolorian in that camp was trying to grow food for them. They are entirely reliant on making back alley deals for grains.
[0:54:47] <%DatAsuna> just fall through gravity wells
[0:54:48] <Klefth> See: Simon Bolivar
[0:54:48] <candidateplays> Literally thousands of years of rule in those states you just said
[0:54:53] <Exodusprime1256> see Caesars legion
[0:54:56] <ATPsoldat> Empire under Thrawn would have been much more deadly.
[0:54:57] <+BubbaRands> See the Brits~ See the Brits~
[0:54:57] <lotharrio> Oh no... only a thousand years of peace.
[0:54:59] <+NWannabe> See USA circa
[0:54:59] <%subjectg> You say that, but we’re living in a corporate empire atm
[0:55:00] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, a couple thousand years is no joke
[0:55:01] <+NWannabe> now?
[0:55:07] <Klefth> LUL
[0:55:08] <%RioGascar> Nah palpatine had a master plan
[0:55:08] <Redblood801> I blame the Ruusan Reformation
[0:55:10] <+MagicBeanBurrito> The S E N A T E
[0:55:13] <%RioGascar> he control it all
[0:55:16] <eliudfs1> To be fair, the Republic had multiple golden ages
[0:55:16] <+tearfuldevil> I AM THE SENATE
[0:55:21] <+tearfuldevil> SO ITS TREASON
[0:55:21] <%Jetzord> And then the new republic gets blown up
[0:55:25] <%DatAsuna> It wasn't even his final form!
[0:55:25] <%RioGascar> no one CAN RUN SHIT ON THIS SCALE
[0:55:28] <eliudfs1> and multiple milenia of peace
[0:55:39] <thequickbrownrabbit> the darkside made him brown like a week old banada
[0:55:41] <+oda_flobunaga> Empire Under Thrawn got defeated by a frackking slave race that stabbed them in the back
[0:55:46] <%Ashenik1> eeee honestly imperisalism big bad right, but if you live in the stable empire its kindda nice thing
[0:55:57] <shincadad> OH BOY
[0:56:03] <%DatAsuna> Yeah thrawn's fatal mistake was also his supposed strength
[0:56:14] <shincadad> 50 minutes of dialogue
[0:56:16] <+NWannabe> You need Spartans AND Athenians working together
[0:56:21] <shincadad> I love it a lot
[0:56:23] <Klefth> In other words, you'd be fucked
[0:56:23] <%DatAsuna> akak assume things about people based on their culture
[0:56:27] <+MagicBeanBurrito> just kill the thirsty and hungry
[0:56:33] <lotharrio> They'd get integrated, like Mira, into the Mandolorian system.
[0:56:39] <%RioGascar> So thrawnes biggest mistake is
[0:56:39] <+oda_flobunaga> Thrawn was a tactical/strategic genius who couldn't play politics
[0:56:41] <%Gruhunchously> On the one hand, another 50 minutes of dialogue, on the other hand, I'm here for this shit, so...
[0:56:44] <%RioGascar> Underestimating
[0:56:56] <+tearfuldevil> yeah
[0:57:01] <%Ashenik1> you say Gengis with ch like church
[0:57:02] <+oda_flobunaga> Politicians got to Politic
[0:57:08] <%BisoromiBear> "We're going west, are you in or what?"
[0:57:08] <%DatAsuna> What happened to the mongols though is they kinda just ended up getting turned into the chinese
[0:57:09] <+MrAtheGreat> Genghis Khan also ruled with fear.
[0:57:10] <+tearfuldevil> thrawns biggest msitake was his shit taste in art
[0:57:12] <+tearfuldevil> there
[0:57:14] <+tearfuldevil> i said it
[0:57:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Palps got to Palp
[0:57:28] <candidateplays> plenty of people managed large conquests and consolidated them. The romans lasted until 1453.
[0:57:34] <PinkSocks> Revan understood snacks
[0:57:42] <%DatAsuna> Thrawn had good taste ins carves tho
[0:57:44] <steelstwitchaccount> I mean, anything you do for the Republic right now is just getting it ready for Palps
[0:57:50] <ATPsoldat> Oof
[0:58:03] <DSD24> It was incomptence
[0:58:08] <+evbites> it was petty shit dogma
[0:58:09] <%ChoculaUltra> 4. Yeah, big big cowards.
[0:58:10] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, these answers aren't great
[0:58:11] <DSD24> Incompetence
[0:58:16] <thequickbrownrabbit> the jedi wanted to speak to their manager
[0:58:17] <+tearfuldevil> 1 is true
[0:58:19] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 2
[0:58:20] <+evbites> scared of sining
[0:58:21] <+tearfuldevil> the reasons sucked
[0:58:24] <lotharrio> The Jedi weren't hiding out of fear. They were just indecisive.
[0:58:24] <ATPsoldat> 1 is technically true
[0:58:24] <Camail> it wasnt fear, technically
[0:58:27] <+tearfuldevil> but they had reasons
[0:58:28] <%DatAsuna> 3 isn't really a defense either
[0:58:31] <giga_bit> I mean, it honestly wasn't fear. In the literal sense, at least.
[0:58:39] <Daxalog> Your a light sider. So jedi is your hometown now
[0:58:52] <steelstwitchaccount> gOoD rEasOnS
[0:58:52] <+BlockingDisabled> It WAS fear, but fear of the Dark Side, not the Mandos.
[0:58:56] <illTemperedSeaBass> It wasn't *fear* that kept the Jedi out. The inflection makes the statement true.
[0:59:19] <lotharrio> "Revan deserves respect. But on the down low, you're a massive badass and I like you."
[0:59:20] <%DatAsuna> Well they are, mostly
[0:59:21] <+tearfuldevil> it was sort of fear though
[0:59:24] <+evbites> smug jedi:we do not fear the mandos we fear ourselves
[0:59:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> This is the way
[0:59:25] <+tearfuldevil> but it wasnt't
[0:59:31] <+tearfuldevil> yeah, what @BlockingDisabled said
[0:59:32] <+prime_name> this is the way
[0:59:33] <+IamGrapes> This is the way
[0:59:36] <%Gruhunchously> This is the way
[0:59:36] <steelstwitchaccount> And turn all Peace Loving at some point down the line.
[0:59:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:59:39] <+Ixek> This is the way.
[0:59:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Do you know the Way?
[0:59:54] <GarbageNirvana> "We don't do push-ups. We push the galaxy down."
[0:59:55] <ch3ggy> !motivated
[0:59:55] <@Moobot> 1066 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:59:58] <CaptHat211> Dust off some Chuck Norris jokes.
[0:59:59] <ch3ggy> HELL YEAH
[1:00:05] <%DatAsuna> There's non-warrior mandos
[1:00:07] <lotharrio> The major turning points were war and battle.
[1:00:08] <%Gruhunchously> The Mandalorian warrior never sleeps, though he dreams of conquest
[1:00:11] <muniea3> Mandos don't do push-ups, they push the planet away
[1:00:19] <%ChoculaUltra> now that's an era of the internet I'm so grateful we're past
[1:00:24] <ATPsoldat> There's Twilek hooker.
[1:00:37] <steelstwitchaccount> The exiles life HAS revolved around the same things.
[1:00:37] <+tearfuldevil> oh god
[1:00:41] <+tearfuldevil> okay so
[1:00:41] <%oldneckbeard> do we every see a female mando?
[1:00:46] <+tearfuldevil> i was aorund for chuck norris memes
[1:00:51] <lotharrio> Answer 1 is Space Paladin.
[1:00:51] <+tearfuldevil> but i never got it
[1:00:51] <Dangerzone979> chuck norris is a bitch
[1:00:53] <steelstwitchaccount> Only in the clone wars tv series.
[1:00:57] <lotharrio> @oldneckbeard Mira is, technically.
[1:00:58] <+BlockingDisabled> Mira is kind of a Mando IIRC
[1:00:59] <%subjectg> “And by uniting the disparate clans, I will create my own Outer Heaven!”
[1:01:00] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven's Mask was a female Mando's mask
[1:01:02] <dead_harmony13> Lmao gl
[1:01:02] <stainingspade0> @oldneckbeard SWTOR
[1:01:03] <shincadad> Uh huh
[1:01:06] <thequickbrownrabbit> Answer 1 would forgive obeto
[1:01:12] <+tearfuldevil> why did people ever think chuck norris was cool
[1:01:14] <steelstwitchaccount> More like a Child Soldier pulled along for the ride.
[1:01:23] <%DatAsuna> @oldneckbeard comics and books are full of them
[1:01:27] <lotharrio> Well Mandalorian is a culture anyway.
[1:01:29] <Dangerzone979> @oldneckbeard like in this game or in the greater setting?
[1:01:42] <%Gruhunchously> Hmm HMMM
[1:01:44] <+tearfuldevil> @oldneckbeard books, comics, 1s in Rebels
[1:01:50] <%oldneckbeard> okay thanks chat
[1:01:51] <lymund> Vegeta
[1:01:55] <CaptHat211> @ATPsoldat Woolie is part Skesis
[1:01:57] <%xcompleasedad> FREE LOOT
[1:02:01] <+MagicBeanBurrito> It rhymes
[1:02:02] <sendart> woolie turning into the birds from the dark crystal
[1:02:12] <%ChoculaUltra> lowkey also sounds like Dark Souls NPC dialogue lmao
[1:02:16] <%RioGascar> We see female mandos in the mandolorian
[1:02:28] <%subjectg> You’re gonna burn, alright
[1:02:29] <steelstwitchaccount> It's fascinating to me that, in the world of Star Wars, they still have Concepts of Heaven & Hell.
[1:02:36] <Breakfast_Megapowers> how much of Woolies love for this game revolve around Mandalorians
[1:02:36] <steelstwitchaccount> And call them by those names.
[1:02:44] <%DatAsuna> tl;dr there are many female mandos
[1:02:45] <candidateplays> There's a femal Mandalorian IN THIS GAME
[1:02:46] <CaptHat211> There are numerous female Mandalorians in TCW cartoon
[1:02:49] <ATPsoldat> Can we talk in a place not full of air traffic?
[1:02:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Female Mandos appear in the Old Republic comics
[1:03:00] <thequickbrownrabbit> pockets would invent force loot all
[1:03:02] <+prime_name> They probably think it's a really special gun
[1:03:04] <lotharrio> @steelstwitchaccount Well that's because the Word of God is almighty and present in all reality. Hallelujah, Amen.
[1:03:06] <%LiterallyTotori> mandalorian? more like mandon'tlorian
[1:03:10] <%DatAsuna> there's also rodian mandos
[1:03:10] <Carl_Von_Lucoa> yo wassup woolie
[1:03:17] <%alpharius88> pocket's took their weapons y sold them
[1:03:25] <theotrainwreck> im gettin some real brudda vibes off this dude
[1:03:30] <+tearfuldevil> yeah mandos don't have to be human
[1:03:33] <%RioGascar> Im still amazed the mandolorians didnt manage to blow up their home planet
[1:03:34] <LeafSprout> How did you become the mandalore?
[1:03:43] <%subjectg> mandos originally weren’t human, too
[1:03:46] <+tearfuldevil> @LeafSprout be the biggest badass, get the helmet
[1:03:50] <ATPsoldat> Revan is fucking Sun Tzu
[1:03:53] <%subjectg> the taung came first no)
[1:03:55] <lotharrio> Yo what happens if Excalibur fell in the ocean?
[1:04:02] <%Double_Tap_That> These pocketsssss are deep
[1:04:03] <steelstwitchaccount> So Anakin is literally Jesus.
[1:04:10] <CaptHat211> Do you think Mandalorians would love Warhammer 40K?
[1:04:10] <lotharrio> Yeah
[1:04:15] <%Gruhunchously> She took it and put it in her pockets
[1:04:16] <The_err0r> Same with the dark saber
[1:04:18] <LeafSprout> are you telling me mandalorians used to worship one dude
[1:04:18] <thequickbrownrabbit> sells mandos helmet ath the nearest spacemart for 100 credits
[1:04:18] <CrmznOgre> it would be funny if Revans helmet was Mandalore's helmet
[1:04:20] <ThePimpGuin> how did you get the helmet back? "I found it in the cargo hold" "what?" .."what?"
[1:04:20] <+Llewelln> some aquatic tart in ponds distrubuting swords is no way to determine legitimate authority
[1:04:24] <%subjectg> Strange women lying in ponds is no basis for a system of government
[1:04:24] <%Jetzord> Like Killmonger burning the flowers
[1:04:26] <CrmznOgre> like extra fuck you
[1:04:29] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus the Persians had a thing where the political and cultural power was concontrated in a holy statue: capture the statue you hold the society hostage
[1:04:30] <+Zouledge> @lotharrio it kind of did since it was returned to the lady of the lake after arthur died iirc
[1:04:41] <%DatAsuna> well you weren't
[1:04:45] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven's helmet was a female's mando's helm
[1:04:46] <%DatAsuna> Revan seperates from the party
[1:04:54] <illTemperedSeaBass> @steelmorrigan I mean, most religions have had concepts of heavens and hells. Valhalla and Helheim, Mount Olympus and the Realm of Hades (specifically Tartarus), etc.
[1:04:56] <%DatAsuna> You were just on the star forge when she beat him
[1:05:05] <+evbites> @lotharrio you have to deal with the bitch of the sea and she is really salty
[1:05:07] <lotharrio> @Zouledge Yeah but water sprite holding onto it until the sleeping king reawakens is different than, "Oops, dropped it into the Marianas Trench."
[1:05:13] <stainingspade0> @lotharrio oh wait… Excalibur fell in a lake, guess no one’s gonna be king now
[1:05:18] <jnaynnay> mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO
[1:05:20] <thequickbrownrabbit> pockets was using it as a chip bowl
[1:05:30] <+Zouledge> @lotharrio fair point
[1:05:34] <+Ixek> Hah.
[1:05:34] <gruulmagebeast> in woolies canen
[1:05:35] <+jake5713> Like the Darksaber thousands of years late...old habits die hard I guess.
[1:05:35] <+tearfuldevil> revan is male or female
[1:05:36] <%Gruhunchously> @legacy0117 You choose Revan's gender in this game
[1:05:36] <steelstwitchaccount> There were swords in the last game stronger than lightsabers/
[1:05:37] <theotrainwreck> Are the mandos in this just the Romans? war society based on truth and not lying and shit?
[1:05:38] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Kreia's got spunk
[1:05:44] <+tearfuldevil> "canon" revan is a dude
[1:05:44] <+BlockingDisabled> Kreia gives lore!
[1:05:51] <+tearfuldevil> but swotor
[1:05:52] <ATPsoldat> @legacy0117 CANONICALLY, Revan is male. But that's Bioware dumb shit
[1:05:56] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven is hermaphrodite
[1:05:56] <LeafSprout> question: does KOTOR1 save carry of into KOTOR2?
[1:05:59] <muniea3> I just wanted some blue milk
[1:06:04] <+tearfuldevil> @LeafSprout no
[1:06:05] <%Gruhunchously> Female Revan 4 life
[1:06:06] <LeafSprout> damn
[1:06:07] <steelstwitchaccount> It do not.
[1:06:08] <candidateplays> Romans were a sedentary culture, first and foremost, nothing like The Mandos.
[1:06:13] <lotharrio> @LeafSprout No, but you tell the game really early what your last game was like.
[1:06:20] <+tearfuldevil> @LeafSprout at the start, you pick your revans gender, and their alignment
[1:06:26] <+griffball13> ADAPT OR DIE
[1:06:26] <LeafSprout> ah ok
[1:06:27] <phatmac16> someone stop that airplane!
[1:06:33] <CaptHat211> Do you think Mandalore has an economy that has competing brands of armor cleaner complete w/ commercials?
[1:06:35] <steelstwitchaccount> That was not a very common thing about that time.
[1:06:40] <LeafSprout> pick at the start wether or not you killed mission lol
[1:06:41] <illTemperedSeaBass> @candidateplays You don't make an Empire like Rome with a "sedentary" culture.
[1:06:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:06:47] <lotharrio> It... will make assumptions on romance, I think.
[1:07:01] <steelstwitchaccount> I mean you basically had one choice per gender.
[1:07:09] <theotrainwreck> He took that really well
[1:07:10] <jorniev> woaaah
[1:07:12] <thequickbrownrabbit> okay boomer
[1:07:15] <lotharrio> Wasn't there lesbian space cat option?
[1:07:17] <+griffball13> ok boomer
[1:07:18] <jorniev> yes
[1:07:22] <steelstwitchaccount> I heard you could lez with Juhani but I do not recall to that.
[1:07:23] <Redblood801> ok boomer
[1:07:26] <lotharrio> So we have an explanation on why all the old party members lost their levels. GOT IT.
[1:07:29] <jorniev> mandalore the wise
[1:07:41] <%Gruhunchously> Are you trying to provoke me?
[1:07:41] <StrikingEarth> boomerlore
[1:07:42] <phatmac16> I've killed someone like you thousands of times, Jedi
[1:07:54] <%kekkerscrew> Were you trying to burn me about being old? Yeah I'm old I'm still badass
[1:07:55] <gruulmagebeast> let me get my basilisk grocery cart
[1:08:02] <candidateplays> @illTemperedSeaBass Sedentary means the form of their agriculture base. As opposed to the nomadic pastoralism of the Mongol/Turks/Steppe peoples in general, which the Mandolarians are much more closer too.
[1:08:07] <lotharrio> In fact... do we have reasons for everyone who should be a bad-ass, being low level?
[1:08:26] <LeafSprout> mandalore should start at lvl 99
[1:08:27] <lotharrio> So real quick! Mandalore should be a melee character, fuck what he's built as already. His stats are already set!
[1:08:28] <steelstwitchaccount> The game needs to happen.
[1:08:30] <%Gruhunchously> Armor doen'st restrict Dex rolls for attack, only for defense.
[1:08:31] <alexandrecau> low level still mean you kill 10 men
[1:08:43] <%sund0wner> Hi Wools, hi everyone
[1:08:43] <+Justlaxy> I didn't know that about the implants I feel ashamed.
[1:08:46] <%sund0wner> Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:08:51] <%kekkerscrew> Naw Mandalore should be full heavy weapons
[1:08:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Give Cando Swords PLS
[1:08:56] <%Gruhunchously> Cando for melee, HK for ranged, I would say.
[1:08:57] <%RioGascar> never knew this was a mechanic
[1:09:02] <%RioGascar> then again dumb child
[1:09:07] <Fathuran> @lotharrio because you could have gone to this planet first. video gamessss
[1:09:09] <thequickbrownrabbit> it be funny if mandos alinement effects his appernce evil mando just has angry eyebrows drawn on the helm
[1:09:09] <gruulmagebeast> now mandalore never looks different now matter what you give him right?
[1:09:15] <CaptHat211> The one downside is what are Mandalorians doing when they're not fighting b/c I can't picture Mandalorians grocery shopping in that amor.
[1:09:17] <%Chatterbox1991> Patrick Henry: Give me straight up Liberty or give me straight up Death!
[1:09:20] <%Gruhunchously> Mandalorian booty
[1:09:20] <LeafSprout> woolie admires flat mandalore ass
[1:09:21] <CaptHat211> *armor
[1:09:24] <+Llewelln> level 4 implants give immunity to shock, stun and a few others. key to have
[1:09:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> FEELS GREAT
[1:09:30] <%Gruhunchously> Old man ass
[1:09:32] <candidateplays> You literally cannot give Mandalore new armor. That is his armor
[1:09:32] <%subjectg> But they already regen health anyway, so i think the regen implant is superfluous
[1:09:37] <+Zyquux> 5Head Cando
[1:09:38] <StrikingEarth> many feets
[1:09:38] <ThePimpGuin> swords!
[1:09:41] <thequickbrownrabbit> feels like im wearing nothing at all nothing at all nothing at all
[1:09:44] <thequickbrownrabbit> mando
[1:09:45] <gruulmagebeast> how come we never see mandalorian women besides in rebels?
[1:09:47] <lotharrio> Aww. Oh well.
[1:09:52] <steelstwitchaccount> Mas guns
[1:09:53] <ThePimpGuin> he got no dex tho
[1:09:56] <steelstwitchaccount> *max
[1:09:59] <candidateplays> No Dex
[1:10:01] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Soldier is Reggie class cuz of all the FEATS
[1:10:01] <+Zyquux> Ranged Mandalore DansGame
[1:10:14] <+Abdul1295> did woolie see narutos and hinatas wedding. it's pretty funny especially with Orichimaru goofing around the town
[1:10:15] <CaptHat211> @gruulmagebeast There are Mandalorian women in TCW
[1:10:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Max Guns and no DEX to hit with
[1:10:15] <%DatAsuna> rifle
[1:10:23] <+MrAtheGreat> It may look bland, but that ass is so tough that when a hand tries to clap it, that hands gets clapped first.
[1:10:23] <steelstwitchaccount> But max guns tho
[1:10:30] <candidateplays> WHY?????
[1:10:31] <+Zyquux> Why waste all of his strength and his free strength bonus
[1:10:32] <%DatAsuna> Heavy repeater is the way
[1:10:36] <%subjectg> what a shame, mando is a beast with melee
[1:10:38] <%Gruhunchously> Don't forget to give him Precise Shot
[1:10:41] <theotrainwreck> how come the mando women question comes back up every few minutes? They around, also chat hornee
[1:10:44] <thequickbrownrabbit> its high noon
[1:10:44] <LeafSprout> @gruulmagebeast because people used to be sexist about stuff related to star wars before the clone wars
[1:10:51] <%DatAsuna> Nah cando is heavy weapons guy
[1:10:53] <ThePimpGuin> it feels right but its so inefficient
[1:10:54] <lotharrio> Plus on a Lightside playthrough there's no one else to give Tremor Swords.
[1:11:05] <gruulmagebeast> the mandalorian wage gap is false
[1:11:07] <LeafSprout> clone wars introduced most of the popular female characters
[1:11:12] <ATPsoldat> Cando seems like a rifle guy
[1:11:26] <%kekkerscrew> LeafSprout People " Used " to be sexist about Starwars? cmonBruh
[1:11:29] <%Gruhunchously> Female Mandalorians get one fourth less honor.
[1:11:35] <steelstwitchaccount> More like a gatling gun guy... which he started with in the last one.
[1:11:35] <theotrainwreck> ye TCW has the best female characters in Star Wars
[1:11:40] <+Llewelln> I like to have a melee assistant to take them away from me
[1:11:42] <illTemperedSeaBass> @candidateplays While it may play a part in it, agricultural base is different from culturally sedentary. They may have farmed, but they were culturally amongst the most expansionistic people in western history. People *voluntarily* enlisted into the permanent standing army. Both were largely unheard of before, and for thousands of years afterward.
[1:11:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Clone Wars didn't introduce Mara Jade or Zori Bliss
[1:11:56] <ATPsoldat> Ahsoka Tano might be a great character, but she didn't start out as one.
[1:11:59] <steelstwitchaccount> Whom?
[1:12:00] <LeafSprout> is best boi Carth in this game
[1:12:10] <lotharrio> Yeah but except for his starting feats, statwise he's built for melee, and since he's stuck in heavy armor, dex loses most of its appeal.
[1:12:12] <%a_goth_pancake> ashokaaaaa...
[1:12:21] <drabberfaun535> Cheer500 Hey V and double V Hoes mad 2 :the sithlords was Aprils hottest single, and Im hyped for your next song Dokapon :Blood money.
[1:12:34] <theotrainwreck> actually now that I think about it most of the cool chicks in TCW started out dumb, especially Ventris and Ahsoka
[1:12:56] <theotrainwreck> Ventris gets REALLY cool
[1:13:14] <+oda_flobunaga> DOn't forget what's her face from Rogue One
[1:13:16] <CaptHat211> Oh stop it, chat. There were FEMALE Mandalorians in past works like the Republic Commandos series which was pre-Disney.
[1:13:26] <LeafSprout> I would say most characeters in the first 2 seasons started out pretty dumb, not just the females
[1:13:33] <theotrainwreck> thas true
[1:13:33] <steelstwitchaccount> I have, indeed, forgotten what's her face from Rogue One.
[1:13:37] <%Gruhunchously> Soldiers have feats pretty much every level, yes
[1:13:40] <+BlackLightRadia> Y'know, Since Mando kept traveling with Revan you think he's dark side crusty under the helmet?
[1:13:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[1:13:43] <theotrainwreck> ani started out unbearable
[1:13:48] <LeafSprout> when is there female mandos in republic commando?
[1:14:00] <steelstwitchaccount> I only really liked ani in TCW
[1:14:07] <steelstwitchaccount> The voice helped.
[1:14:08] <lotharrio> @AverageBlubber He's just a skull under the helmet.
[1:14:09] <candidateplays> @illTemperedSeaBass You're using a completely bizarre definition of Sendentarism.
[1:14:15] <%DatAsuna> Also ventress was better in the comics than the show
[1:14:32] <theotrainwreck> The best part of TCW is the episodes that are just hanging out with Clones
[1:14:33] <%DatAsuna> Back when she was a rattataki with better tatts
[1:14:35] <+tearfuldevil> i liked ventress in gendy
[1:14:35] <CaptHat211> @LeafSprout Vhonte Tervho
[1:14:36] <theotrainwreck> fives is mah boy
[1:14:36] <+oda_flobunaga> With all of this the obvious conclusion is Kreis is best Waifu though
[1:14:37] <%a_goth_pancake> seeing ashoka grow up plays a lot into why shes such a good character
[1:14:42] <LeafSprout> @lotharrio dude imagine skull knight mandalorian
[1:14:45] <+tearfuldevil> no idea what she's like in 3dcw
[1:14:47] <%DatAsuna> gendy ventress runs with the comic version
[1:14:52] <+BlackLightRadia> raw
[1:15:05] <%Gruhunchously> Rawr
[1:15:06] <+tearfuldevil> well
[1:15:09] <lotharrio> @LeafSprout He opens his helmet and pulls out a sword made of lightsaber hilts.
[1:15:11] <steelstwitchaccount> Man, these uneven STR and CON scores are maddening.
[1:15:12] <jorniev> i hope the mandalorian becomes mandalore in the show... or at least gets involved with that part of the history
[1:15:13] <+tearfuldevil> i guess i saw her in the movie lol
[1:15:24] <%subjectg> That +0 dex breaks my heart
[1:15:25] <%emperordread> "Clean ass-blasters" is the name of an adult movie
[1:15:33] <%DatAsuna> Yeah a lot of ahsoka fans were happy she grew up so they could stop feeling like pedos.
[1:15:35] <LeafSprout> @lotharrio "I can make a rift through the force itself"
[1:15:42] <candidateplays> max Dex bonus of +0 - make him into a gun guy!
[1:15:51] <+oda_flobunaga> +0DEX BAD FOR GUNS THOUGH
[1:15:52] <CaptHat211> @LeafSprout It was "RC: True Colors" and several comics.
[1:16:05] <theotrainwreck> Is Rebels good?
[1:16:10] <thequickbrownrabbit> time to coat mando in flextape for ultmate armor
[1:16:11] <LeafSprout> @CaptHat211 oof i only played the game
[1:16:15] <LeafSprout> NO REBELS IS NOT GOOD
[1:16:16] <%Gruhunchously> The Dex restriction doesn't apply to guns, only defense.
[1:16:17] <green_skeleton> Do my eyes deceive me? KOTOR 2 is back?!
[1:16:19] <%roaches_coaches> roaches_coaches subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:16:34] <%kekkerscrew> theotrainwreck Rebels is not good. But it has a couple of fun episodes
[1:16:38] <%subjectg> I know it doesn’t affect attack rolls, but it’s not optimal
[1:16:40] <%DatAsuna> @LeafSprout it was the RC books, not game
[1:16:42] <theotrainwreck> cool
[1:16:43] <steelstwitchaccount> Wait, so he can't get any added accuracy? I thought that only meant no DEF bonus cause of heavy armor.
[1:16:45] <lotharrio> @green_skeleton Strong chance you're drunk. G0-T0 sleep.
[1:16:51] <aloveidiots> Who would win Obi-Wan or Kakashi?
[1:16:54] <LeafSprout> oof the audio
[1:16:56] <+Zouledge> @theotrainwreck imo it has good parts but but still not as good as clone wars
[1:16:57] <illTemperedSeaBass> @candidateplays Only if the definition you're using for sedentary doesn't align with the actual definition of the word. Korea was culturally sedentary: non-active, their borders remaining almost unchanged for as long as the people have existed as evidence of it. Few people were as active as the Romans were.
[1:16:58] <+prime_name> Audio stutter?
[1:17:01] <%Gruhunchously> Oh no
[1:17:02] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ive come from 1 year in the future to tell you all Woolie is still equipping characters on Onderon
[1:17:02] <+Bluemanzee> wobbly music again :)
[1:17:02] <LeafSprout> AUDIO

[1:17:11] <green_skeleton> Rebels is fine, but not as good as TCW

[1:17:28] <LeafSprout> @WoolieVersus AUDIO is crispy
[1:17:31] <steelstwitchaccount> Audio is fine for me?
[1:17:32] <%kekkerscrew> Rebels biggest problem is that it has incredibly bad tonal issues. It has goofy silly comedy that does not fit the story going on around it.
[1:17:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that audio is CRISPY
[1:17:43] <theotrainwreck> ok ye, thats the vibe I always got from it. average with some fun moments
