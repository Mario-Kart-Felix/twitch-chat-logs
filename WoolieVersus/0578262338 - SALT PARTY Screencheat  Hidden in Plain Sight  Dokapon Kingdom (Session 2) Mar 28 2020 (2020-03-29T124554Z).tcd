[0:09:02] <%winds_0f_change> it's been out for at least a week
[0:09:21] <+chiazam> What I love about this is it invalidates ALL the rules of playing COD with friends
[0:09:39] <+tearfuldevil> @andrei11dr the english/french canadian rivalry is 90% a joke, at least among people who are like, 40 or younger

[0:41:47] <+TopTieramisu> minh's playing marvel 2 without meter
[0:41:48] <Pacohax> there's apparently a colorblind mode that applies to all players that gives each color a unique texture
[0:42:01] <NevikGamina> oh is there a colourblind mode?
[0:42:03] <%andrei11dr> Men ,im glad i can see colors, you take that shit for granted LUL
[0:42:15] <%TheOneUpWarrior> @pacohax that actually really cool!
[0:42:16] <Ipsenscastle> Woolie norm`ally has zero spatial awareness, where is this skill coming from?
[0:42:24] <SubjectX07x> @WoolieVersus People are saying there's a colorblind mode
[0:42:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Ipsenscastle ok so you cant see the opponent on your screen so you can only look at them from their screen and gauge where they are based on their area. It's playing off the old ways of local multiplayer FPS where you look at the screen of the opponent to know where they are
[0:42:36] <+liquidzr0> cvHazmat sup
[0:42:41] <+gustavozxd> well play the game instead of camping then LUL
[0:42:42] <Tucker0603> goes through everything
[0:42:44] <D00D64> Woolie is more aware of the space of others when cheating is involved
[0:42:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Ipsenscastle so you blindly shoot at the area where they are based on their screen
[0:43:03] <+TopTieramisu> woolie just imagines his enemies as pies and he can hone in

[1:27:26] <jubejube56> Lol wtf is this logic Reggie
[1:27:27] <usurper_sos> Reggie going in
[1:27:31] <@Menitta> Like i'm trying to unfocus my eyes to see where the coins disappear
[1:27:49] <+RioGascar> i cant even tell if the coins disappear
[1:27:51] <%optosi> they only disappear when the crosshair goes over them
[1:27:52] <+jiggy_snipe> what
[1:27:52] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:27:54] <@Menitta> THEY DON'T?
[1:27:57] <%Javaa01> The coins disappear after the fact
[1:27:57] <%RioGascar> oh my god
[1:27:58] <heartlesshealer> so coins only move?
[1:27:58] <+Aheg0d> noise
[1:27:58] <$StaceMcGate> WHAT
[1:27:58] <+jiggy_snipe> that's so hard
[1:27:59] <+Mendin> I may have accidentally That One Guy'd woolie
[1:28:03] <Hawkbone_> What the fuck is going on
[1:28:04] <%andrei11dr> Oh they don't?
[1:28:07] <%SuperKirby24> so wait is there a penalty for a sniper to shoot the innocent? does it auto end the game?
[1:28:09] <%RioGascar> THEY DISAPPEAR AFTER FUCKING SCROLLING OVER
[1:28:20] <+Mendin> Coins randomly despawn and respawn I think
[1:28:20] <@Menitta> that's actually busted
[1:28:24] <%RioGascar> As the sniper
[1:28:30] <+jiggy_snipe> they are disappearing but idk why
[1:28:33] <usurper_sos> It is random
[1:28:34] <+Mendin> Limited bullets on the sniper
[1:28:34] <falineth> the sniper has to look at them
[1:28:37] <+KineKithZen> Whe nhe moves his cursor over them
[1:28:39] <+jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[1:28:40] <Hawkbone_> If thats the case then this game is literally impossible for the sniper
[1:28:48] <usurper_sos> MISS
[1:28:50] <zedravan> they disapper once you shine the sniper light on them after they got stolen
[1:28:50] <%RioGascar> i think the sniper cursor has to be on the coins for them disappear
[1:28:51] <jubejube56> The jukes
[1:28:53] <+jiggy_snipe> nice
[1:28:56] <%SuperKirby24> ah ok limited bullets
[1:29:06] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersusYou have to shine the light on the coins
[1:29:06] <%The_Timo> Should Swap the teams
[1:29:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[1:29:08] <oyyzzo> 3 LUL
[1:29:13] <%The_Timo> 2 snipers and 1 thief
[1:29:13] <DedlokPM> so this is like Medival Fantasy Spy Party
[1:29:16] <usurper_sos> So the sniper can disappear coins
[1:29:28] <%Javaa01> The coin disappears after a delay after a pickup
[1:29:40] <@Menitta> thats bruts
[1:29:42] <%RioGascar> no i think they disappear when the sniper scrolls on them
[1:29:44] <@Menitta> brutal*
[1:29:55] <%andrei11dr> Than if they don't disappear then that is way more harder than i thought
[1:30:03] <@Solidus_113> they disappear when the sniper looks at them, the coins only stay when out of focus because that was the last known location
[1:30:13] <%RioGascar> Thats so hard
[1:30:20] <NekoZen> sniper has to keep scanning
[1:30:20] <floornine> Hi Woolie
[1:30:24] <+KineKithZen> "tch"
[1:30:27] <+Aheg0d> i know :)
[1:30:27] <%The_Timo> Yeah it should be swapped, 2 snipers and 1 thief
[1:30:30] <NekoZen> and paya ttention to the group of peeps who were there
[1:30:32] <NevikGamina> that tch
[1:30:35] <NevikGamina> LUL
[1:30:40] <+Mendin> Wow I am challenging Woolie to poker if I ever meet hi m
[1:30:46] <+KineKithZen> 2 snipers would just be able to scroll the spotlight over everything at once
[1:30:46] <+Mendin> He has no bluff face
[1:30:51] <oyyzzo> nobody is innocent
[1:30:53] <Nihilisticdestroyer> if sniper doesnt win yeah try 2 snipe
[1:31:13] <Hawkbone_> I feel like the sniper has no chance unless they have a partner
[1:31:14] <Zealion27> he is lol
[1:31:15] <+Verd_254> he's not marking ai as clean, you gotta play this like minesweeper, mark the ones that don't make the noise
[1:31:22] <%SuperKirby24> go really bad and use 3 snipers to go to town LUL
[1:31:27] <%andrei11dr> If you were a God, you could probably look at the directions they are holding and figure it out that way
[1:31:27] <@Menitta> If the coins disappeared when the sniper sees the coins, that would make sense

[1:32:08] <DedlokPM> yeah there are too many factors that make it too hard for the sniper.
[1:32:13] <NekoZen> sniper really has to keep scanning
[1:32:16] <+chiazam> I dont get it
[1:32:18] <$StaceMcGate> Needs to be 2 on 1

[1:32:58] <@Solidus_113> Coins disappear when the sniper looks at them, the coins only stay when out of focus because that was the last known location @WoolieVersus
[1:32:59] <%optosi> all you need to do is aim at a coin that characters are walking towards, if it doesn't ding mark them as innocent

[1:50:08] <NekoZen> ninja just rush
[1:50:09] <islandoasis> 2 ninjas 1 knight seems best
[1:50:09] <Meltgar> Camp the royalty
[1:50:11] <NekoZen> rush the royalty
[1:50:21] <NekoZen> there is only 1 knight

[1:51:29] <NekoZen> rush
[1:51:37] <+Mendin> 1 ninja now
[1:51:39] <jubejube56> I guess ninjas move faster than knights?
[1:51:50] <%rubbishbinge> the knight outs himself pretty hard
[1:51:51] <%SuperKirby24> so knights can just rush ninjas even if they're exposed?
[1:51:53] <Manwad> ninja can also stun the knight
[1:52:00] <resloxxx> ninjas move faster an the other knights dont do shit I think
[1:52:04] <+Mendin> We dont know how long a knight stun is
[1:52:19] <%optosi> don't ninjas have the smokebomb still?
[1:52:25] <@Menitta> What is the in universe lore behind royalty being around all these ninjas
[1:52:29] <Meltgar> LUL WHY go for the one guarded?

[2:05:55] <hagakure114> lol
[2:05:56] <%NWannabe> woolie assumptions yall
[2:05:57] <oyyzzo> the game was rigged from the start
[2:05:57] <usurper_sos> Woolie won
[2:06:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> What form of power is this?
[2:06:04] <Rhinoprotoss> Woolie assumptions are usually wrong
[2:06:04] <JetpackMcQuack> whipSmerg
[2:06:06] <%The_Timo> Lol Woolie Assumes, what a great name for a show
[2:06:07] <islandoasis> the survivors won
[2:06:07] <+buttdirt> i just got here and i have no idea what is going on, but i'm mad at woolie
[2:06:08] <%skylerpilot> Nah, win state is "High Score"
[2:06:09] <+InfiniteHav0k> Sniper cannot "win"
[2:06:15] <Hawkbone_> So how does the sniper win, then?
[2:06:16] <+jiggy_snipe> you all have to play and compare assassinations
[2:06:19] <buerdo> Woolie got job done it’s how well the job was done
[2:06:19] <benboyman> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2:06:20] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Have multiple snipers, and see howmany you can assassinate solo
[2:06:22] <Sundaysmiles01> The game will break up families
[2:06:33] <Eli_Droidness> t101Big t101Oof
[2:06:34] <crimsonsaens> If the sniper misses an assassin, they lose.

[2:06:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh is righr

[2:06:45] <%skylerpilot> Minh is right
[2:06:49] <%The_Timo> Lol Woolie you're so wrong
[2:06:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Tell that to those poor npcs woolie
[2:06:52] <+paladinstarbuster> U didn't win
[2:06:55] <%SuperKirby24> MiniK
[2:06:56] <%Gamefriendly> @WoolieVersus the game was tracking the assassinations
[2:07:02] <SetsuRyuu> Minh is super right on this one though
[2:07:02] <crimsonsaens> Winners are compared between runs when assassins died
[2:07:03] <+Animefreak369> no in THAT game mode it states that the assasins are to KILL ALL NPC
[2:07:04] <@Menitta> I still think the race mode is the best

[2:39:23] <%arkv01> minh answer the fuckin question PunOko
[2:39:35] <Sundaysmiles01> I thought Woolie was wearing camo fatigues and then realised he was geared to blend into a vineyard
[2:39:37] <+jiggy_snipe> remember how good FF7 FMVs looked
[2:39:41] <unclerizla> @NWannabe ahhhhh, I suppose. The index isn't that expensive tho, really, and I assume he has a high-end ish setup
[2:39:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:39:50] <+Mendin> Woolie is wearing an old audubon society book

[2:39:52] <unclerizla> but yes, as a "console", VR is expensive

[2:49:45] <+HDmexiqtioner> You can still be wrong
[2:49:47] <Ipsenscastle> Minh operates in a world where you find your favourite thing as a child and then never look forward to anything ever again
[2:49:48] <KRaZyAmmo> dunk Minh
[2:49:57] <+Taglog7> DOA beach volleyball
[2:50:04] <%glgzephyr> ok but is Dokapon next tho
[2:50:04] <+jiggy_snipe> I think he's saying his 12 yr old self wouldn't care
[2:50:07] <%rubbishbinge> Minh being confident but Woolie is equally confident
[2:50:11] <%andrei11dr> And even though it's your favorite game, you still won't LP it wooliePOYO
[2:50:19] <sunsetserenity1> I turned 12 in 2013, not enough has changed for me to be super surprised.
[2:50:27] <%RioGascar> Portal is a real game changer
[2:50:31] <worldbrand> i would have loved to show my lttp playing 8 year old self BotW
[2:50:32] <BimboBagging> what about "Dreams"?
[2:50:38] <%Javaa01> Superhot no one just thought of, but it could have been done in the late 90s on stuff like Quake
[2:50:41] <%TheOneUpWarrior> @woolieversus death stranding
[2:50:41] <Triplicat> did Woolie ever say if he was gonna take a look at One Step From Eden? I can't even remember if he was an MMBN fan but probably not
[2:50:50] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus What is your least favorite Kirby game? GivePLZ
[2:50:56] <%glgzephyr> I don't think he played MMBN
[2:51:04] <@Solidus_113> Liam was the Battle Network fan
[2:51:07] <TigerClaws12> ok but what about Death Stranding? Kappa
[2:51:11] <%skylerpilot> Minh seems to think that 12 year him played his favorite game and said "this will now be my favorite game forever" instead of it happening naturally over time when compared to the rest of his experiences
[2:51:15] <+jiggy_snipe> the concept of online
[2:51:16] <%rubbishbinge> @Triplicat Woolie did not reach Heatman in MMBN1
[2:51:24] <Triplicat> that was probably it
[2:51:25] <@Solidus_113> PS3
[2:51:26] <+BionoidLCR> oh man MAG
[2:51:27] <nothuzad> ps3 yes
[2:51:28] <@Solidus_113> 256 players
[2:51:28] <+jiggy_snipe> I liked MAG
[2:51:29] <+kekkerscrew> dear god I thought people were joking We're actually doing Dokapon Kingdom again
[2:51:30] <Hammatime8> WAS a game called MAG
[2:51:30] <%Javaa01> Mid era PS3
[2:51:31] <+jiggy_snipe> 256
[2:51:31] <Hawkbone_> AW MAN MAG WAS THE SHIT
[2:51:34] <%TheOneUpWarrior> imagine being an aspiring postman
[2:51:34] <+kekkerscrew> MAG was crazy
[2:51:34] <+BionoidLCR> i loved MAG
[2:51:35] <+Kensei_cornutus> I liked mag because I was a dumb child
[2:51:35] <%andrei11dr> Oh ,i would show myself Cod 4,compared to shit in the early oats it would blow my mind
[2:51:35] <alaskanbullwurm> 256
[2:51:39] <Hawkbone_> 256
[2:51:40] <Solidnick18> i tried playing that as a kid and never could
[2:51:40] <coldfire0007> 256
[2:51:46] <%glgzephyr> what was MAG
[2:51:51] <%glgzephyr> am I being dense
[2:51:52] <%skylerpilot> you show any 12 year old kid in the 90s some new shit and they will lose their minds
[2:52:06] <coldfire0007> Mag was awesome
[2:52:09] <%TheOneUpWarrior> KNOWING that Death Standing was gonna be a fire as fuck mailman simulator with some crazy KOJIMA shit
[2:52:10] <+Kensei_cornutus> mag was a very low quality military shooter with huge numbers of players
[2:52:13] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus RESISTANCE 2 multiplayer was exaggerated geezus doodHokey
[2:52:15] <Garry_Guyface> Woolie: Combo Kids: BIG NUMBER
[2:52:16] <SubjectX07x> MAG was a PS3 shooter in which its entire draw was it's 256 player count. @glgzephyr
[2:52:16] <+jiggy_snipe> tbh the map was large so it was rare to see all 256
[2:52:18] <Sundaysmiles01> Search and Destroy was similar on CoD
[2:52:21] <mihokspawn> command and conquer renegade had 256 playes back in '02
[2:52:26] <%glgzephyr> on PS3? that's nutty
[2:52:38] <SubjectX07x> @mihokspawn Those were only modded servers though no?
[2:52:41] <Hawkbone_> I wish I was old enough to appreciate MAG. I only got to play it as a dumb 10 year old
[2:52:44] <@Solidus_113> The CELL Processor
[2:52:59] <Hammatime8> @sundaysmiles01 search and destroy was just counter strike
[2:53:02] <N1netbattler> I wonder why they didn't do mag on ps4
[2:53:10] <@Solidus_113> League started around 2010
[2:53:14] <%Gamefriendly> ithought MAG was designed that the full 256 could never intereact, it was like 4 separate 64 player games?
[2:53:15] <SubjectX07x> I remember playing modded servers in that game, I feel Renegade got a terrible rap because of its single player but the multiplayer was sick. @mihokspawn
[2:53:16] <Sundaysmiles01> thats fair
[2:53:25] <+jiggy_snipe> @Gamefriendly pretty much
[2:53:38] <+jiggy_snipe> but we knew we were all there Kappa
[2:53:39] <%RyuuAoi> Show 12 year old self Dark Souls.

[3:22:53] <+Mendin> FFLegend 2, It's literally called Nasty Dungeon and if you get through it, an NPC asks if you thought the dungeon was nasty, and if you say no, they go "Ok then back in you go!" and bunt you halfway into it again

[3:24:21] <@Solidus_113> Remember class bonuses on weapons
[3:24:23] <+Mendin> The best part is that Nasty Dungeon is entirely optional, it's its own separate dimension that you walk into, that NPC hands you the plot mcguffin you need to collect, and you can walk right back out
[3:24:30] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> So have you guys even heard that Accordion cover of Song of the Ancients? It's pretty good
[3:24:35] <%SuperKirby24> @BlackMage66652 disgusting, real cultured men ask the item waifu to step on their face LUL

[3:39:25] <masterfire23> The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice. There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.
[3:39:26] <%TheOneUpWarrior> there was a key space tho right?

[4:56:42] <chickenhunter> it reset when the town was taken
[4:56:44] <heartlesshealer> maybe it was a last chapter thing?
[4:56:47] <htimssamoht> You probably don't have any room in your inventory.
[4:56:54] <NeroInfinite> you can only move one
[4:56:58] <NevikGamina> ohh is he full of items?
[4:57:00] <+kekkerscrew> It's not important
[4:57:00] <%NWannabe> @CommanderSqueaks The worst part is Reggie barely went after him
[4:57:10] <Monkeyweed21> The mission is to beat that boss
[4:57:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> The Game must be broken
[4:57:15] <%GenesisKnight> Can you not grab two quest items in a row?
[4:57:18] <+Mendin> Reggie could have killed Woolie like twice more during his devildom
[4:57:19] <heartlesshealer> You completed a chapter before getting to Volga
[4:57:22] <Zalthia> Kirby would be so ashamed of Woolie’s behavior
[4:57:22] <heartlesshealer> by saving dog
[4:57:23] <NevikGamina> hmmm
[4:57:24] <dapperskeleton69> if only ONE GUY told them what to do
[4:57:28] <NevikGamina> weird
[4:57:32] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe it was a chapter 1 thing
[4:57:33] <0rond> GUIDE
[4:57:33] <Sol_Install> ok that's weird
[4:57:34] <chickenhunter> It takes time for the town item to be made and it reset when the town was taken over
[4:57:34] <0rond> BOIS
[4:57:35] <medril07> so the reign is over
[4:57:35] <%arkv01> good time tonight
[4:57:36] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus When the town gets captured the timer for the item showing up resets.
[4:57:42] <Badgerconda_> Question: Why is Woolie wearing my grandma's couch?
[4:57:43] <crimsonsaens> The item is separate from the chapter
[4:57:50] <$StaceMcGate> psa1guy where are you when we need you?

[4:58:08] <heartlesshealer> time?
[4:58:10] <%NWannabe> He too scurred to be the hero
[4:58:11] <Jetsfantasy> Delete will will randomly delete a piece of gear, all money, all items, all field magic or take away a town
[4:58:12] <0rond> woolie is trying to masquerade his salt as justice
[4:58:14] <Oxybe> @badgerconda_ he's wearing all our frandmas' couches.
[4:58:16] <chickenhunter> its that for sure
[4:58:20] <heartlesshealer> reggie, what does "timer" mean in this case?
[4:58:23] <+tasenhall> Matt playing Predator with Matt
[4:58:26] <jubejube56> Maybe we should check the VOD to see if that icon was there
[4:58:27] <%NWannabe> You could have destroyed Woolie THRICE
[4:58:27] <+tasenhall> with MAX
[4:58:29] <heartlesshealer> Why did you say "timer"?
[4:58:29] <+Vallarflax> @WoolieVersus you can pick it up from the bank space
[4:58:30] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda surprised chat knows about in-depth mechanics about this game. My headcanon kind've let me believe Woolie owned the only copy of this game
[4:58:33] <heartlesshealer> oh
[4:58:40] <dapperskeleton69> @stacemcgate wheres that emote from?
[4:58:41] <%chiluzza> ocal Items are special items that are produced by Towns that have reached level 3 and Castles (the period of time required for the production of local items has not yet been recorded). As with Assets, successfully attacking a town will yield the town's local item to the attacker, provided it has produced one.
[4:58:47] <%chiluzza> YOU NEED TO UPGRADE IT
[4:59:01] <jubejube56> @chiluzza it was like level 5
[4:59:16] <chickenhunter> it takes a few days after you take over the town for the item to generate
