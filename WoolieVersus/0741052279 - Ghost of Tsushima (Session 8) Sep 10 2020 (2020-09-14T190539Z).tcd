[0:47:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Hey, y'all notice how the game kinda sidesteps how terrible Jin and Masako is as lords by saying "nah, they had it coming though"
[0:47:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SHES SUCH A BADASS
[0:47:21] <+solzan2000> am angry for her

[0:48:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @doomerskeletor13 gee, sounds like propaganda to me. Weird
[0:48:12] <+Weeewer> no no no
[0:48:16] <+Weeewer> its 15 + 7.5
[0:48:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:48:19] <ralphfromdk> math is hard, huh?
[0:48:21] <mellorolo> she is softening up to you, truly is our granny..
[0:48:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait no that's not how it works
[0:48:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Anyway, Ryuzo was right and Jin sucks Kappa
[0:48:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Quick maths
[0:48:34] <+solzan2000> kinda powerful
[0:48:41] <+Weeewer> yes
[0:48:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @weeewer Are you sure it's multiplicative and not additive?
[0:49:00] <+Weeewer> Uhh im pretty sure its multiplicative
[0:49:02] <EMP_SoloSagat> oh boy
[0:49:05] <+Weeewer> 10 becomes 15
[0:49:08] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Hey chat! Just got here. Did I miss anything major?
[0:49:09] <MichaelDood> Whens the Mass Destruction charm Kappa
[0:49:12] <+Arkfyre> woolie no
[0:49:16] <therealtacopancakes> it's 50 of the percentage. 10 becomes 15 10+5
[0:49:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IT DOUBLES THE BASE PERCENTAGE
[0:49:21] <+Weeewer> Not 20 XD
[0:49:21] <CappuccinoGuil> 20% still good, though
[0:49:21] <%doomerskeletor13> I hate math LUL I‚Äôm so bad at it

[0:49:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 10% BECOME 20
[0:49:30] <+Weeewer> 50% is not double!!
[0:49:31] <DensityD> hate mate
[0:49:32] <CappuccinoGuil> IT'S ALMOST AS IF %s ARE BULLSHIT
[0:49:35] <+Harro8> MATH
[0:49:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:49:37] <+Weeewer> 10% -> 15%
[0:49:44] <%Rosewater_444> MY GOD NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:49:45] <ralphfromdk> It's not explained well at all, but at least he got it now :D
[0:49:46] <outsidedoubtside> still real good ngl
[0:49:53] <%DensityD> not additive
[0:50:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> QWIK MAFFS
[0:50:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Games need to not be afraid of showing math.
[0:50:11] <%doomerskeletor13> It sounded broken, but it was our math that was broken
[0:50:28] <+Harro8> Theyre not really hiding anything
[0:50:32] <Daxalog> Showing numbers leads to player dissatisfaction and anxiousness.
[0:50:36] <+MessyBristles> just read though
[0:50:38] <+Weeewer> I understood what i meant immediately lol
[0:50:38] <%DensityD> they are not hiding, just use your brain, show your work, no calculators allowed
[0:50:40] <MiraLangsuir> WOOLIE WANT BIG NUMBER
[0:50:50] <TopLeftCenter> It's still stupid good, especially paired with some of the other stuff you get
[0:51:05] <outsidedoubtside> WE USING OUR FROG PERCENTAGES
[0:51:08] <%DensityD> way too good
[0:51:10] <+Weeewer> Its broken with the 40% chance to get your arrow back on Head shots

[0:51:36] <MiraLangsuir> Steiner Maffs
[0:51:39] <+solzan2000> I stacked yurikos charm, really effective
[0:51:58] <+Weeewer> 15% chance to refund is still good
[0:52:05] <%Rosewater_444> The R.E.G. system putting in work
[0:52:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i liked yuriko's with two fortune charms, with later armor it was poison/fear build
[0:52:24] <%Jack8274> Jack8274 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Pat fox, get swol
[0:52:26] <ralphfromdk> That charm might be the single best one in the whole game
[0:52:39] <+Weeewer> I also rock the Yuriko charms + Tayadori armor and just go crazy with slo-mo arrows
[0:52:53] <KyaputenFarukon> that momentum
[0:52:55] <+solzan2000> poison arrows so good
[0:53:10] <+solzan2000> and poison wind chimes
[0:53:22] <+Weeewer> I switch to poison wind chimes any stealth-forced mission
[0:53:25] <+Weeewer> they're so OP
[0:53:32] <+solzan2000> yea
[0:53:40] <%Rosewater_444> assuming...
[0:53:48] <%bread_assassin> Anyone know that if the Charm of Silence you get from the foxes gives a better resolve boost than the Charm of Resolve? One charm gives percentages and the other uses words.
[0:53:50] <ralphfromdk> solzan2000 But... what good will poison arrow do when i hit them in the face for 1 shot kills? :l

[0:54:44] <CappuccinoGuil> it's like a 1.8m by 1.8m by 0.6m. That's a LOT of dirt
[0:54:46] <yunamtsang> Headbands are almost always on top of pagodas
[0:54:46] <outsidedoubtside> animals come to scavenge, or worse yet, rotting bodies expand and burst
[0:54:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Dude it took me two whole days just to dig out a two feet deep garden, six feet would take forever

[0:55:26] <mellorolo> also close the lid for your toilet flush
[0:55:26] <+froduck42> plus animals will smell the bodies and dig them up

[1:19:56] <@akuda_bar> @akuda_bar "homosexual underground," where you just fathom the nature of homosexuality for 12 hours until you understand it
[1:19:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Its very traditional
[1:19:57] <%doomerskeletor13> This stream is making me want to do research on homosexuality in ancient Japan now
[1:20:04] <%Rosewater_444> This game takes place during the second invasion of Tsushima, right?
[1:20:06] <danknugglit> But the level 3 tho
[1:20:07] <+Irridium> go one more over

[1:21:01] <Halospaz117> I'm not actually sure, and I'm pretty sure the game does take liberties for plot
[1:21:02] <+AWanderingKenku> What's next Gosaku's armor though?
[1:21:12] <MiraLangsuir> Founds a school of philosophy on it.
[1:21:24] <Halospaz117> I say the Sakai set looks better in black
[1:21:24] <%doomerskeletor13> The game takes plenty of liberties with time period, it‚Äôs not historical really
[1:21:25] <+Estuko> Can you imagine having a duel with a samurai and he just gouges your insides with his fucking horns
[1:21:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Jins fursuit
[1:22:00] <Halospaz117> Honestly, I think my favorite part of the Sakai helmet is the brim across the eyes

[1:24:50] <Halospaz117> I get that, helmets good for battle, but for conversations you wanna see the face
[1:24:50] <misterurbanthelegend> Its cool
[1:24:56] <Halospaz117> @imspacingout nope
[1:25:01] <kenny_biff> samurai armor > everything else
[1:25:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm with Pat, I want a stupid looking character so it looks like I'm humiliating my enemy when I beat them
[1:25:53] <+BonewheelVanguard> Straw hat + full upgraded Kensei looks best
[1:26:02] <%doomerskeletor13> I agree Woolie
[1:26:13] <+Razputin217> Oops All Chosen Ones
[1:26:13] <+Estuko> LUL that's kinda why I like Runescape (osrs) we're all a bunch of dumb knights wizards archers running around

[1:26:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "yo i heard you guys are cool but i guess not"
[1:26:29] <outsidedoubtside> i like to wear the riverbed straw hat, river prowler ronin set, and a white face cloth and rp my version of the ghost as a river spirit
[1:26:29] <Halospaz117> I changed my gear depending on the situation, I went Ronin most of the time just going place to place, but for big battles I put on armor
[1:27:07] <+jiggy_snipe> it's less bad when Jin is gonna be in front
[1:27:17] <therealtacopancakes> i like this scene
