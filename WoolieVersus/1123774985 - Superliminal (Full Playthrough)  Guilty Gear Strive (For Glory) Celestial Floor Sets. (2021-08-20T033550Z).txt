[0:03:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> When Reggie is not on the screen, everyone should be asking, "Where's Reggie?!"
[0:03:24] <ShortAssRibs> RIP Reggie
[0:03:25] <yukichocomilk> he couldn't make it out alive
[0:03:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie was never real

[0:04:21] <+Scevda> You overestimate peoples capacity to read i think
[0:04:29] <mrtanaka111> when is kirby lore series gonna continue?
[0:04:31] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie waiting at the QAIC for 4 hours aswe speak
[0:04:31] <neurocalcin> when Reggie's not on screen he doesn't
[0:04:32] <leith_aziz> This year
[0:04:35] <%kyh9> @dds333a "Reggie-kun, why do you keep talking about the Vancouver Hockey team?!"
[0:04:36] <%Irridium> September
[0:04:38] <%Lion_kun> I DIDN'T COME HERE TO READ
[0:04:39] <%bread_assassin> Is it bad that my first thought was Zero Two from Darking in the Franxx?

[0:04:54] <dave_guns> @bread_assassin yes, yes it is :(
[0:04:57] <%dds333a> @bread_assassin yes
[0:05:07] <Applecannon63> I thought it was Kamen rider Zero Two?
[0:05:20] <Mehless> I am excited to see Woolie do Sick combos on puzzle pieces

[0:05:33] <Applecannon63> but Zero-Two is cool
[0:05:35] <%Kriss1827> key word: Shouldn't
[0:05:38] <@Solidus_113> but woolie, this game is all "seeing" things LUL
[0:05:39] <Tisaric> oh no
[0:05:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> I've got my mouthguard in so I don't grind my teeth down too much
[0:05:41] <dave_guns> You will do fiiiiiine
[0:05:44] <%dds333a> This is gonna be terrible
[0:05:44] <+mikesapartment> ganbate

[0:05:53] <2guard> believe in the me that believes in you
[0:05:55] <Tisaric> controller should be totally fine
[0:06:03] <%DocDaneeka_01> controller is fine
[0:06:06] <Mehless> is fine
[0:06:07] <@Solidus_113> it's fine
[0:06:10] <iroh20> its watevs
[0:06:10] <%dds333a> ue
[0:06:11] <NeakGX> mouse and keyboard is better I think
[0:06:19] <%Exiliator> Use a racing steering wheel
[0:06:21] <%livlinn> sipsipSipsipblind woolieSPICE psaBlind
[0:06:22] <Deko_> mouse up
[0:06:23] <DrkJP520> i think you're gonna need your hybrid setup for this one
[0:06:28] <@Solidus_113> totally

[0:06:32] <%livlinn> good luck
[0:06:32] <+Mattismen> good luck
[0:06:33] <Tisaric> yeah it's a short one
[0:06:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> Fightstick is optimum
[0:06:37] <dave_guns> no need to become a cube warrior
[0:06:40] <Applecannon63> mouse it thats kinky
[0:06:44] <+Stormiercashew> it's pretty short, but good
[0:06:58] <leith_aziz> 3D or 2.5D?
[0:07:07] <%holydeviant1> (give us that snowboarding game with the reverse ballcap kirby)
[0:07:10] <Super_Okuman> Wolud you like a Mario 64 styke Kirby Game?
[0:07:14] <%vaderxyz1970> Does Kirby need to be 3D?
[0:07:19] <%SirGO0SE> sup gang
[0:07:21] <+Scevda> Kirito is even WORSE than that.
[0:07:23] <%dds333a> Air Ride worked Kappa
[0:07:26] <mrtanaka111> do you still play kingdom death monster, and is there any chance youll make a new series on that?
[0:07:26] <dave_guns> Kirby 3D would feel SO SLOW
[0:07:29] <@Solidus_113> Kirby has never been one for good responsive 3D movement
[0:07:30] <Applecannon63> Kirito is just god with a special worth ammount of semen
[0:07:36] <dave_guns> He's very tiny
[0:07:37] <%Exiliator> Kirby, but like, WAAY too high def please
[0:07:37] <Tisaric> yeah all we need is combining powers to come back
[0:07:45] <%holydeviant1> Yo, combo powers was sick, we need more of that
[0:07:48] <%vaderxyz1970> Never Mind we need Air Ride 2
[0:07:48] <Applecannon63> 2D Kirby forever
[0:07:50] <Super_Okuman> I can see a 3D kirby game working
[0:07:51] <heartlesshealer> Crystal Shards was fun
[0:08:01] <+Scevda> How is power combos not a cornerstone at this point?!
[0:08:06] <%dds333a> Iirc, Squeak Squad had a neat way of doing so
[0:08:16] <dave_guns> 3D kirbo could work, but not with a back camera
[0:08:20] <%holydeviant1> @Scevda Difference between Hats and elemental powers
[0:08:20] <%dds333a> He could store powers in his bottom screen gullet
[0:08:26] <%Exiliator> I want a Kirby where I can see the pores, like a yakuza mc
[0:08:27] <DrJamesWoods> Is the stream just starting?
[0:08:34] <Super_Okuman> the world of kirby would be so fun to navigate in 3d
[0:08:39] <+Excessumamyamy> @DrJamesWoods 21 minutes uptime
[0:08:42] <leith_aziz> @DrJamesWoods 5 -10 minutes late
[0:08:45] <Applecannon63> 2.5D Kirby over 3D Kirby
[0:08:48] <%vaderxyz1970> Isometric Kirby?
[0:08:50] <%SirGO0SE> dream course is the true 3d kirby
[0:08:51] <heartlesshealer> The only reason power combos isn't a corner stone is because it would replace the "Mix" mechanic for swallowing two enemies at once
[0:08:54] <dave_guns> WOO SPONSOR
[0:09:14] <%dds333a> Imagine the timeline where we got a Kirby 64 akin to the jump between DKC and DK64

[0:30:08] <%SirGO0SE> this game begging to get QA'd
[0:30:08] <miucsa51> QA
[0:30:09] <Mehless> sick
[0:30:10] <%dds333a> woolieMINHMAX
[0:30:13] <kingra> QA POWERS OVERFLOWING
[0:30:14] <elshadow7> Woolie's Bug Attractor Field can potentially destroy this game.
[0:30:14] <Mehless> not sick
[0:30:18] <%AkumaXDemon> i think its big enough
[0:30:21] <Pt_Kamen> @dds333a yep. He's name was Incitatus
[0:30:24] <heartlesshealer> You wanna go for it? This game has a checkpoint system
[0:30:24] <%KetsuoTaberu> Woolie whatever you do don't use 100% of your QA powers
[0:30:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> how does he do it
[0:30:41] <+Excessumamyamy> PogChamp
[0:30:42] <+Rekinsinn> dont forget you can rotate things
[0:30:42] <%holydeviant1> I don't think the game can kill you with objects, like how portal doesn't "cut" you
[0:30:51] <@Solidus_113> the main speedrun tech in this game is clipping yourself through objects and launching out of the map
[0:30:51] <%Seancicle> ‚¨ÜÔ∏èE
[0:30:52] <+Excessumamyamy> DO IT
[0:30:52] <heartlesshealer> LUL

[0:31:07] <Mehless> the devs seem cool with the speedrun tech
[0:31:21] <%dds333a> @holydeviant1 Aperture explained that right? how'd they swing that?
[0:31:28] <Deko_> this is giving me big portal vibes
[0:31:31] <drunken_lemur> Fuck! Partitioned walls!
[0:31:42] <%holydeviant1> @dds333a it pushes you out
[0:32:03] <%holydeviant1> For BIG objjects, it can cut, but for humans, it never will

[0:37:25] <%holydeviant1> Really loud alarm AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
[0:37:27] <dave_guns> snooze is pointless
[0:37:29] <Mehless> Suite Dreams
[0:37:29] <NotHereToStream> loud alarms and alarms at the interval of 5 minutes
[0:37:29] <%mighty_max_t> Ugh, my snooze is only 5 minutes.
[0:37:33] <%AkumaXDemon> so...no gift card?
[0:37:33] <%dds333a> And when it drops, well...
[0:37:44] <Pt_Kamen> is your dream on fire?
[0:37:45] <Tisaric> If you did it outside I guess it would default to the closest planet/star/whatever you happen to be looking at LUL
[0:37:46] <dave_guns> if I want to snooze I just turn it off
[0:37:56] <%dds333a> Gross
[0:37:57] <Tisaric> and it'd be fucking massive
[0:37:57] <Ziegsy> theres an achive for playing with the fire extinguisher
[0:38:00] <+EchoXOF> my alarm requires me to solve math equations, always gets me awake enough to not doze off again
[0:38:04] <dave_guns> @pt_kamen yeah :c

[1:26:54] <Indigo_Automaton> True
[1:26:57] <gunsrlove> Avocado on its own is just grease
[1:27:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait who eats a raw avocado by itself?
[1:27:03] <%Exiliator> avocado toast, the infamous hipster food
[1:27:03] <%dds333a> uh huh CarlSmile
[1:27:05] <+Meathands> just a little salt and lime, I'll eat an avocado out the husk
[1:27:06] <+chadwicktouchdown> guac = good, avo = shite
[1:27:06] <Xhog1> There are some foods that work better mixed in with others
[1:27:09] <dmtjinni> never tried avocado b4
[1:27:14] <Xhog1> Rocket and spinach are a couple
[1:27:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> Avacado is great with some shit like soy sauce/sesame oil dip, otherwise yeah, it's like eating wet paper
[1:27:16] <%Vigonept> I do, i eat raw avocados. theyre great
[1:27:17] <gunsrlove> Healthier grease than palm oil or whatever, but still just grease
[1:27:20] <%dds333a> @cobalt_phoenix_ me
[1:27:21] <Fenrisulfr_V> @cobalt_phoenix_ I do. Just cut it open, remove nut, sprinkle a bit of salt, and eat it with a spoon.
[1:27:23] <+WoodmanDotEXE> Avocado is great and healthy, but it needs STUFF
[1:27:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> interesting
[1:27:31] <Applecannon63> same with Potato
[1:27:41] <iacus_> I've only played teh demo of this game and yet I'm getting a deja vu feeling like I've already seen everything it has to offer
[1:27:44] <extradopeness> sound like charlie brown music
[1:27:48] <Applecannon63> Potato by itself is bleh
[1:27:49] <%Vigonept> nah its fine by itself slather it on a tortilla
[1:27:50] <+Meathands> raw ass potatoes?
[1:27:52] <Xhog1> Is this why people like avacado as a spread?
[1:27:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> oi
[1:27:54] <%livlinn> PSA Dont "cook" avocado in front of animals. It's incredibly toxic to them
[1:27:57] <@Solidus_113> scroll through all the stations, you might find a style you recognize

[1:42:59] <%dukenux> @WoolieVersus have you ever played Antichamber?
[1:43:19] <gunsrlove> Kappa
[1:43:22] <Mehless> We're all just weirdly shaped apples if you think about it.
[1:43:26] <Fenrisulfr_V> Antichamber made me uncomfortable. Something about how quiet it was plus the pure black zones unnerved me.

[1:46:43] <Ziegsy> Ah the miracle of birth
[1:46:44] <%eimiyoshikawa> Rather than the rotary phone thing
[1:46:46] <SaintBurke> they do suck
[1:46:50] <+RazzloJ> we have 5 dollar ones in Canada tho
[1:46:52] <%eimiyoshikawa> Dollar bill vending machines are a good age thing for Canadians
[1:46:54] <+Dr_DangerPhD> now they have vending machines where you can just slide your debit/credit cards
[1:46:57] <%dds333a> they used to eat your shit
[1:46:58] <extradopeness> yeah its absolutely shit
[1:46:58] <+R0DA> rubbing it on the corner of the machine to get the creases out
[1:46:59] <laguerrilha> we have bills, but they not always work well too
[1:46:59] <%dukenux> hate using bills on vending machines. thank god for cards
[1:47:00] <%SirGO0SE> they call them loonies nyannLul
[1:47:03] <taeko_ohnuki> rollback you say?
[1:47:03] <%sporeian94> Use the side of the machine to flatten it
[1:47:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dude if the bill had like 1 imperfection it wouldn't take it
[1:47:07] <karawra> haha yea and if you had a soggy raggedy bill good luck
[1:47:08] <%sewermonk> also we dont have coins that would get a pop without using like 10+ coins
[1:47:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta iron your bills
[1:47:13] <%AkumaXDemon> yoda talk?
[1:47:14] <@Solidus_113> luck good!

[1:48:12] <Equirah> glad they're not a thing in EU
[1:48:14] <Fenrisulfr_V> iirc, the US Silver Dollar became too expensive to manufacture for too few people actually using them
[1:48:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> I think I've seen a dollar coin twice in my life. that's more than I've seen a $2 bill tho lmao
[1:48:22] <laguerrilha> i am NOT going to put my card on a vending machine. that shit definetly will have a cloning part attached

[2:16:15] <Explodincatz> Coke Lyoko
[2:16:15] <+AyupaPupa> i had a dream like that and i went to space
[2:16:16] <%dds333a> C-Moon is at work
[2:16:16] <Indigo_Automaton> The Sky and The Cosmos Are One
[2:16:18] <%derap41> Seen that axiety animation about the guy floating`?
[2:16:20] <CaribouStag> isn't there an anime movie with that premise
[2:16:22] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[2:16:22] <extradopeness> gravity rush definitely hit that vibe for me
[2:16:27] <dave_guns> Surreal indoor dreams are the best
[2:16:35] <WatermelonMerchant> c-moon
[2:16:36] <Fenrisulfr_V> Gonna puke.
[2:16:37] <%dds333a> @explodincatz real talk LUL
[2:16:38] <extradopeness> oh yeah C MOON
[2:16:39] <2017y> gravity rush is a parkour game tho
[2:16:43] <dave_guns> Woolie would love Manifold Garden btw
[2:16:45] <2017y> about doing things coolly
[2:16:48] <2017y> this is a puzzle game
[2:16:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> those dreams where you get into a fight and all your punches feel like air are the worst tho
[2:16:59] <%derap41> I used the get that floating dream a lot didn't like it one bit
[2:17:04] <heartlesshealer> oh man, you can see how brain passively assigned something to "ignore"
[2:17:04] <Equirah> fuck the devs of manifold garden
[2:17:09] <iacus_> Manifold Garden is cool
[2:17:11] <2017y> eventually woolie's gonna try clicking on the one thing you can click on in this room
[2:17:15] <%holydeviant1> The real horror is when the dream fucks with your sense of time and you can't escape
[2:17:16] <CaribouStag> I don't even know why this bit is so disorienting it's not even that crazy.
[2:17:21] <dave_guns> @equirah explain your angry
[2:17:22] <%AyotoCorp> LUL
[2:17:24] <%phd_in_thuggery> yeyeye
[2:17:27] <%derap41> @FuqBoiSlim Or when you're trying to punch as hard as you can but your arm just slows like its in molasses
[2:17:29] <%AyotoCorp> This part of the game is great
[2:17:29] <%dds333a> @fuqboislim this is actually the worst. where nothing happens, or you feel like you're in water
[2:17:35] <SaintBurke> yep that was an animation
[2:17:38] <Equirah> @dave_guns you can just look it up
[2:17:45] <Ecall10528> This is the best part
[2:17:56] <iacus_> prolly some twitter outrage
[2:18:12] <%dds333a> @iacus_ right
[2:18:14] <%holydeviant1> and now all the parts of all the levels come together...
[2:18:18] <%derap41> Why is it always a British guy with that accent like all games use it

[2:19:25] <CaribouStag> expectations? not here, buddy.
[2:19:26] <Fenrisulfr_V> head hurt

[2:19:43] <Ecall10528> This bit sucks.
[2:19:52] <%Exiliator> Ding
[2:19:59] <Ziegsy> do you rotate?
[2:20:02] <%derap41> ok guys timer begins at 32.00 lets see how it goes
[2:20:04] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:20:19] <%dds333a> start over, I guess
[2:20:21] <@Solidus_113> almost accidentally solved it
[2:20:23] <%AyotoCorp> This one's real good
[2:20:23] <Prevot> wait is this just a Mario Lost Levels maze?
[2:20:30] <dave_guns> oh no lost woods
[2:20:44] <theloganbrand> Lost woods but you have a map
[2:20:46] <2017y> alex play kokiri village
[2:20:51] <+FuqBoiSlim> that one jungle section in dmc4
[2:20:59] <heartlesshealer> hey
[2:21:08] <dave_guns> listen
[2:21:10] <%dds333a> @fuqboislim yep, and NMH has one too
[2:21:11] <%derap41> oh shit we got moderator now? sweet
[2:21:16] <heartlesshealer> yay
[2:21:22] <extradopeness> oh yeahhhhh
[2:21:35] <gespenstkick> I pretend I do not see it
[2:21:39] <+ItsSansom> Oh god if he solves it like this....
[2:21:40] <@Solidus_113> not the solution btw
[2:21:50] <LittleWulfie> It's a neat idea
[2:21:53] <Fenrisulfr_V> @Solidus_113 You make great videos, bruh.
[2:21:58] <+FuqBoiSlim> I'm not looking üòë
[2:21:59] <@Solidus_113> this is still brute forcing it
[2:22:03] <vVAstrAVv> he better not brute smart this
[2:22:06] <unthought> brute smarts
[2:22:07] <cs0402196> brute smarts
[2:22:13] <CaribouStag> I wonder how you're actually supposed to solve this bc I can't figure it out either
[2:22:20] <+SodiumPatrol> the solution is to delete sys32 Kappa
[2:22:20] <guiltyboya> think woolie, think!
[2:22:21] <meatman_noplan> I think I got it figured
[2:22:29] <+ItsSansom> I think he's worked it out
[2:22:29] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> juust got here, is he killing it like pat?
[2:22:39] <2017y> trying every thing works in like BABA but i think he needs to click on something here to advance
[2:22:41] <+ItsSansom> Nope
[2:22:48] <extradopeness> i get it
[2:22:52] <dave_guns> can't stop breaking protocol, this is the curse of QA
[2:22:58] <dave_guns> or is it a blessing
[2:23:02] <%SirGO0SE> vargFrenspinHYPER
[2:23:06] <2017y> i remember trying that backing up thing woolie did the first time but i dont remember the actual solution to this puzzle
[2:23:08] <$Spydurman> I've totally forgotten the solution to this haha
[2:23:16] <iacus_> I didn't catch the mechanics to this
[2:23:18] <+tempestzephyr> blinky
[2:23:20] <+AyupaPupa> descending into hell
[2:23:27] <vVAstrAVv> wollie...
[2:23:28] <2017y> timer's at 3 mins so far
[2:23:31] <SaintBurke> I get it
[2:23:36] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:23:37] <heartlesshealer> woolie tried it once and immediately dropped the process, he'll pick it back up again soon
[2:23:38] <+ItsSansom> The answer's simpler than he seems to think
[2:23:40] <+Deadpal> woolie is solving it in his own way @vVAstrAVv
[2:23:46] <+Deadpal> it's suffering but it's fine.
[2:23:52] <CaribouStag> hmmm. I think I get it.
[2:23:54] <%AyotoCorp> He's somehow lucking into the solution half the time
[2:23:57] <%derap41> Are you saying Woolie overthinks stuff?
[2:23:58] <DianaTheAscian> I still don't get it
[2:24:01] <+FuqBoiSlim> I like how the numbers on the clock are gone
[2:24:05] <@Solidus_113> it's 50/50 every time
[2:24:05] <Fenrisulfr_V> Me neither.
[2:24:18] <2017y> several puzzles in this game are open to overthinking
[2:24:18] <%Broand> This puzzle is great
[2:24:20] <JazzerThighsSSBM> i actually have no idea
[2:24:27] <%SirGO0SE> man this drum line is great
[2:24:27] <+chadwicktouchdown> its not 50/50 tho
[2:24:28] <a_mad_dragon_> it's not 50/50, woolie is controlling what side the exit is on
[2:24:29] <extradopeness> oof
[2:24:31] <$Spydurman> I'm still kinda stuck haha
[2:24:39] <@Solidus_113> I mean his guesses
[2:24:43] <+mikesapartment> woolie doin' some 5head stuff
[2:24:45] <%Broand> just gotta ask yourself the right question
[2:24:48] <KaiserMario> LUL it's so simple LUL
[2:24:58] <masterfire23> ah I understand
[2:25:02] <Ziegsy> OH I get it!
[2:25:04] <CaribouStag> Did he actually almost solve it the first time
[2:25:04] <vVAstrAVv> think think think
[2:25:04] <%AyotoCorp> Did he do it?
[2:25:06] <+ItsSansom> He's got it!
[2:25:08] <grimmreper9900> Perception is NOT reality
[2:25:11] <cs0402196> You have to make the exit sign not a liar.
[2:25:11] <%AyotoCorp> Yeaaa
[2:25:11] <+AyupaPupa> oh i get it
[2:25:11] <+blaccbird914> I still dont get it
[2:25:12] <+Pixel_Matt> good timing on the drums LUL
[2:25:13] <%dukenux> i dont get it
[2:25:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> k
[2:25:14] <dave_guns> yay
[2:25:14] <gespenstkick> Yaaaay
[2:25:15] <extradopeness> good shit
[2:25:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok i don't get it
[2:25:16] <%derap41> 5 mins not bad
[2:25:17] <heartlesshealer> üëèüëè
[2:25:17] <meatman_noplan> oooh nice
[2:25:18] <+blaze__drag> yeah whichever way you look first is the dead end
[2:25:18] <CaribouStag> Nice
[2:25:19] <vVAstrAVv> and thinking and PUZZLES
[2:25:20] <Ecall10528> GG!
[2:25:22] <@Solidus_113> so what was the solution @WoolieVersus ?
[2:25:23] <unthought> Woolie, do you understand?
[2:25:24] <%dds333a> neato
[2:25:25] <%bread_assassin> So what was the answer?
[2:25:25] <%Broand> So was that brute smarts or
[2:25:26] <%SirGO0SE> ducky :)
[2:25:28] <DianaTheAscian> someone explain
[2:25:29] <+blaze__drag> you need to always check the wrong way first to make the exit line up with the sign
[2:25:29] <Ziegsy> the way you first look is dead end, so if you look where the exit is it borks it?
[2:25:33] <$Spydurman> where ever you look first is the dead end
[2:25:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh
[2:25:35] <gespenstkick> First way you look is blocked, you gotta look at where the sign points second
[2:25:39] <+ItsSansom> So for people who don't get it: The exit sign points to the correct direction, but the first way he looks will always be blocked off
[2:25:39] <%livlinn> ducko
[2:25:41] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:25:41] <2017y> whichever way you turned would become the dead end
[2:25:44] <%AyotoCorp> LUL Brute Smarts
[2:25:44] <%dds333a> Silence LUL
[2:25:47] <2017y> and the exit signs were right
[2:25:50] <extradopeness> you cant look at where the exit is first
[2:25:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:25:53] <dave_guns> shouldn't have admitted that D:
[2:25:55] <Prevot> LUL
[2:25:57] <%derap41> nah no one gets that puzzle
[2:25:59] <a_mad_dragon_> whichever direction you looked first was the one that got blocked off
[2:26:03] <heartlesshealer> :)
[2:26:08] <+ManOfReason> oh i thought it was odd even
[2:26:12] <+Deadpal> it was looking at which way the arrow looked. THen looking the opposite and going the direction the arrow was.
[2:26:13] <@Solidus_113> the way you look first is always blocked
[2:26:17] <%holydeviant1> It's the second place you look, and you havr to make the exit sign not a liar
[2:26:18] <heartlesshealer> ^
[2:26:19] <theloganbrand> Whichever way you look first was dead end, once you know that you gotta use the exit sign
[2:26:24] <vVAstrAVv> not looking at the sign was a good try tho
[2:26:27] <2017y> shoutouts to :Slight_Smile: :)
[2:26:27] <$Spydurman> first hallway you looked at is always Dead End
[2:26:29] <dave_guns> look the wrong way first to make thr right exit appear
[2:26:30] <grimmreper9900> Which way is NOT correct?
[2:26:34] <%Broand> How come you always see the signs first? is the question you should ask
[2:26:43] <%livlinn> these acrylic water dioramas are cool
[2:26:55] <%derap41> LUL get fucked

[2:52:33] <%Fidranth> "have you tried thinking mor positively"
[2:52:34] <gangsta_oki> damn bruh
[2:52:35] <CaribouStag> can see it suck from EVERY angle
[2:52:35] <Wahrow> Nujabes kicking in
[2:52:35] <Pt_Kamen> there was a lot o "limit break" and easter eggs that you missed
[2:52:36] <+ItsSansom> Aaaaah I always like a positive message, no matter how naive
[2:52:37] <unthought> Similar plot to The Evil Within
[2:52:39] <@Solidus_113> 2Mello got PAID
[2:52:39] <vVAstrAVv> woolie they just wanted to make puzzles lol
[2:52:42] <%KetsuoTaberu> So now are you gonna return to Baba is You? Kappa
[2:52:43] <+blaze__drag> I think this game is a fun experience but I think the puzzle design is pretty weak sometimes. It feels like a ton of the puzzles are just clicking around pointlessly to try and find the one thing you're allowed to pick up
[2:52:43] <357Sneak> cheryl2Jam
[2:52:43] <laguerrilha> mentality yeah
[2:52:44] <%hax_metatron> 2Mello did music for this
[2:52:44] <NeakGX> it's worth checking out the dev commentary in extras on your own time
[2:52:45] <%derap41> Think positively while we stomp your balls

[2:53:28] <laguerrilha> Hope so, this mean he gets PAID
[2:53:29] <shadowdragon1s> yes
[2:53:30] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:53:31] <objektivespieleanalyse> You could accidently play If Found
[2:53:32] <+blaze__drag> Animal Crossing Lets Play lets goooooo
[2:53:33] <extradopeness> yeah thats the idea
[2:53:38] <Gelphaze> I could see Woolie as a therapist just putting people in this test rooms to see what happens.
[2:53:40] <%MelBrooksKA> I thought Later Aligator was on purpose

[2:53:46] <%dds333a> Is he working on Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Kappa
[2:53:46] <Vyneci> SourPls
[2:53:47] <2017y> this game also has one of the hilariously worst challenge modes / challenge difficulties
[2:53:47] <%dukenux> You get naturally attracted to 2mello music, just like Stand users get attracted to each other
[2:53:51] <JazzerThighsSSBM> tell reggie we miss him. hug ya good parents
[2:54:00] <2017y> the puzzle game equivalent of bullet sponge healthbars
[2:54:02] <laguerrilha> Its nice when a good artist you know finally gets notice by the industry in general
[2:54:05] <%hax_metatron> Manifold Garden is great!
[2:54:06] <Drunkengen> i cant believed reggie died
[2:54:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:54:09] <+Nuclearcherries> Its like when you play shooters and Andrew Hulshult appears
[2:54:11] <+blaze__drag> Antichamber is really fun imo
[2:54:11] <meatman_noplan> Antichamber got too high concept for me.
[2:54:12] <%agoaj> Antichamber is a much harder game.
[2:54:17] <+ItsSansom> Oh man, Antichamber is a complete abstract trip
[2:54:18] <%derap41> Its all portal clones
[2:54:20] <2017y> antichamber is actively bad
[2:54:20] <%dukenux> Antichamber was great
[2:54:21] <ronin19xx> Pilliow Castle ay?
[2:54:24] <laguerrilha> Yeah
[2:54:24] <iacus_> Antichamber was alright
[2:54:28] <laguerrilha> Narrative
[2:54:30] <iacus_> nothing special
[2:54:32] <%dds333a> yeah, that was just expository
[2:54:34] <kirbloid> Antichamber can realllly trigger motion sickness tho
[2:54:39] <masterfire23> the Stanley parable
[2:54:41] <JazzerThighsSSBM> SSBMelee is dummy harder but so much simpler. Games are weird.
[2:54:41] <lonosis47> Why isnt reggie here?
[2:54:44] <+blaze__drag> I like antichamber more than this becuase it fucks with you without just randomly changing the rules arbitrarily
[2:54:48] <extradopeness> im gonna try and get my friend to play this
[2:54:50] <%dds333a> Talos Principle is another neat puzzle game
[2:54:51] <+ItsSansom> @lonosis47 Reggie isn't real
[2:54:52] <iacus_> wait it was all a dream? crap story...
[2:54:59] <Visorak6> Extra modes
[2:54:59] <%hax_metatron> BARS
[2:55:04] <ronin19xx> Extra modes?
[2:55:09] <+ItsSansom> Talos Principle is brutally difficult to get the true ending
[2:55:10] <+mikesapartment> you can't break these cuffs
[2:55:11] <laguerrilha> Wish the VA for the narrator in Stanley Parable did more stuff, his voice is great
[2:55:11] <%dds333a> Nah, man. that's the wrong perspective
[2:55:12] <%agoaj> Foucault mode unlocked
[2:55:12] <gespenstkick> If you make yourself small you can just squeeze through
[2:55:13] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That's where Jesus comes in to solve all the problems Kappa
[2:55:13] <JazzerThighsSSBM> Woolie reveals himself to be a nihlist. No one is surprised.
[2:55:17] <tanarath> Paige was playing this & doing alright in the initial bits.
[2:55:20] <Blank9> truly wild super mario bros 2 remake
[2:55:21] <+FuqBoiSlim> Which puzzle was your favorite? I think the size puzzle with the dollhouse was mine

[2:55:27] <%derap41> So whens paratopic?
[2:55:28] <Blank9> oh the challenges are insane

[2:55:38] <DianaTheAscian> Wooile obliterated the message in like 30 sec LUL
[2:55:40] <linSP> from a prisoner‚Äôs perspective, the rest of the world could be considered behind the bars
[2:55:43] <MayorRev> hi albert
[2:55:45] <%derap41> Pathlogic 2 is good also
[2:55:48] <2017y> commentary might be good but challenge mode is real bad
[2:55:48] <lonosis47> Noooo
[2:55:49] <Wahrow> Wesker?
[2:55:54] <iacus_> cool. I love director's commentary
[2:55:59] <unthought> Half Life 2 had commentary like this
[2:56:00] <%livlinn> joofbWave
[2:56:09] <%dds333a> of which Woolz found one
[2:56:12] <iacus_> easter egg... design. they had an easter egg design category
[2:56:16] <laguerrilha> i like these, its nice to get insight of parts of games
[2:56:19] <NeakGX> oh yeah ye didn't find any eggs
[2:56:23] <lonosis47> We dont want to hear these people LUL
[2:56:23] <%derap41> Deus ex Human revolution has really good comentary
[2:56:25] <Drunkengen> after 9 years of development i hope it was worth the wait
[2:56:28] <Dopamien> @derap41 with an extra helping of suffering
[2:56:31] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha agreed
[2:56:44] <Prevot> oh yeah Deus Ex dev commentary was awesome

[2:57:09] <%Exiliator> Very cool.
[2:57:09] <ChallahBread> The puzzles are neat but haring them speak is giving me cubicle farm PTSD. I can almost hear their fingers touching when they talk.
[2:57:17] <@Solidus_113> thanks for playing it

[2:59:22] <%bread_assassin> Did Woolie ever play Baba?
[2:59:25] <Prevot> kirby is happy in his jail
[2:59:26] <unthought> The thing with Outer Wilds, is if you get to the 60-70% mark and are still stumped, it reeeealy slows down
[2:59:26] <%derap41> @Fidranth Kirby knows what he did
[2:59:44] <+fetrigon> @gespenstkick from 13 sentinels
[2:59:47] <JazzerThighsSSBM> Well it just goes to show ya; Money CAN buy happiness.
[2:59:48] <%dds333a> @gespenstkick no, but I know EXACTLY what you're referring to
[2:59:48] <+BoboDaHobo> shit this music is such a chill way to end a stream too, classy
[2:59:56] <2017y> @unthought if you don't know how to read the ship's cheatsheets absolutely
[2:59:58] <%derap41> We need some Cigars and Scotch
[3:00:01] <gespenstkick> Ahh, I see the 13 Sentinels now haha
[3:00:16] <JazzerThighsSSBM> imposters syndrome sucks
[3:00:19] <%derap41> fake it till you make it worst they can do is fire you
[3:00:24] <tanarath> @unthought. Eh? the hints & directions suggest enough that it shouldn't
[3:00:31] <+ManOfReason> sus
[3:00:37] <+Nuclearcherries> Bullshit your way to victory
[3:00:39] <2017y> outer wilds also benefits heavily from a chatmod / friend on discord stream that knows the game being there to offer hints. I did some things correctly and got bugged out and would have been left retrying for hours otherwise
[3:00:40] <%Deft_Thought> Am I sus? NotLikeThis
[3:00:42] <verscoll> 2020Shhh
[3:00:50] <JazzerThighsSSBM> am I the amogus?
[3:00:52] <MayorRev> Why is kirby locked up

[3:02:01] <unthought> The period between kings
[3:02:05] <laguerrilha> Speaking of 2001, did you finish Outer Wilds?
[3:02:07] <extradopeness> im afraid i cant let you do that woolie
[3:02:13] <+Dragoneye77> Is this famous future Battlefield 2042 streamer Woolie Madden NFL 2022
[3:02:17] <%derap41> Or the Whitespace?
[3:02:31] <2017y> remember that time woolie played the entire disgaea series
[3:02:32] <vVAstrAVv> SIN
[3:02:33] <cs0402196> I had imposter syndrome but I had recently gone in the deep end of multiverse theory, so I thought Everything Else was an imposter.
[3:02:33] <Explodincatz> do it
[3:02:38] <%Wydamn> Outer Wilds DLC might be coming soon so wait for that maybe
[3:02:47] <AnneSQF> Doooooo iiiiiit

[3:03:19] <+Markmeltzer> @WoolieVersus Is Fallout New Vegas a possibility in the future?
[3:03:20] <vVAstrAVv> im still dreaming of nioh 2 with reggie
[3:03:24] <Dopamien> FeelsBadMan the disco has to end
[3:03:24] <%sewermonk> @phd_in_thuggery heat death of the universe is when
[3:03:28] <2017y> outer wilds explicitly needs an omniscient hint giver
[3:03:30] <meatman_noplan> Outer Wilds is real cool.
[3:03:33] <%derap41> @Markmeltzer You just moved it at least 12 months back
[3:03:33] <%Exiliator> I'd like to see Reggie do the regular helltaker story, then Woolie do the dlc
[3:03:42] <2017y> because you can be completely off base, or have the correct solution and have the game just fuck you over sometimes
[3:03:47] <Drunkengen> is it a wrap?
[3:03:49] <%dds333a> eh?
[3:03:49] <laguerrilha> @livlinn Outer Wilds need another set of eyes no the playing person dont get spoiled on chat
[3:03:50] <+Markmeltzer> Oh

[3:14:35] <%phd_in_thuggery> that happened to me trying to beat my brother in CVS1
[3:15:01] <+R0kushi> I've been using nago's blood sucking grab a lot more
[3:15:03] <2017y> this world; is better suited to DRIFT
[3:15:07] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus have you been playing on PS or PC?
[3:15:07] <+R0kushi> has helped me a lot
[3:15:10] <Ziegsy> 'Weeeeeoooooo weeeeee! weeeeooooooweeee'

[3:15:24] <%Broand> PC videogames
[3:15:26] <%phd_in_thuggery> wonderful!
[3:15:53] <DianaTheAscian> have they even mentioned the delay?
[3:15:54] <+Spoonsire> PC = mods = best version
[3:15:58] <leith_aziz> YEAH HE GOT IT
[3:16:01] <%Broand> Custom colours?
[3:16:05] <+Nuclearcherries> The Woolie colours
[3:16:05] <laguerrilha> SonicFox games of Gio teached me so much. specially of abusing punch for chip
[3:16:06] <leith_aziz> I have that mod as welll
[3:16:07] <%phd_in_thuggery> yoooooooo
[3:16:25] <leith_aziz> oooh, Coming Home. Great song
[3:16:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:16:28] <+JustToWatch> of they do console PC crossplay without fixing the delay I think I'm going to have to double dip
[3:16:30] <+R0kushi> playstation price is absurd in my country and since Im not a tourney person, pc it is
[3:16:46] <extradopeness> hotashi really is that dude
[3:17:06] <meatman_noplan> Yo Faust's crouching light punch is so fast
[3:17:07] <leith_aziz> I've only played a bit of Nago, so I'll see if I can help in any way
[3:17:20] <Equirah> 4p?
[3:17:23] <leith_aziz> @meatman_noplan isn't it 7 frames? That's kinda slow
[3:17:34] <leith_aziz> Its strength is its reach
[3:17:41] <stanlychicken> and its a low
[3:17:55] <leith_aziz> 2s?
[3:18:12] <Applecannon63> dat Woolie skin
[3:18:15] <MayorRev> oh wow you can simulate the round start in training mode?
[3:18:26] <MayorRev> thats neat
[3:18:29] <+ManOfReason> oneeHappy coming home oneeHappy
[3:18:35] <+jepupu> "You could 6p that" -the game.
[3:18:42] <tanarath> Ps4 is actually faster for strive than 5,btw
[3:18:44] <%Broand> That Ram hit ends me every time
[3:18:45] <leith_aziz> @MayorRev Training mode is actually pretty layered. But it's lacking frame data
[3:19:03] <NotHereToStream> you ever learned to PRC your frametrap into a command grab?
[3:19:25] <leith_aziz> a tip about Ram's Far S is that once they go with 5S, they wont do anything afterwards, so get in from that

[3:19:45] <leith_aziz> They usually try to Far S again or start jumping
[3:20:31] <+chadwicktouchdown> thinking of getting a secondary, probably gonna be nago
[3:20:48] <leith_aziz> wow
[3:21:26] <NotHereToStream> usually people would react to the projectile
[3:21:33] <+chadwicktouchdown> wtf dead space remake
[3:21:48] <leith_aziz> @NotHereToStream actually, people usually get hit by Nago's projectile because of its delay
[3:22:00] <leith_aziz> They expect Nago start attacking or going for the grab
[3:22:21] <Blank9> yeah the dead space remake is ridiculous, especially when the real people behind it they fired seem to be working on that other game
[3:22:22] <NotHereToStream> @leith_aziz disagree, the from special to special, you can tell which is next
[3:22:33] <leith_aziz> You may already know this, but Nago's spin special is 0 on block
[3:22:39] <leith_aziz> it's a good frametrap
[3:23:08] <HarpuiaRivers> Oh sick I caught the strive stream
[3:23:15] <tanarath> Has Wollie done a lore video on Strive?
[3:23:20] <HarpuiaRivers> hapJoy
[3:23:22] <NotHereToStream> have you tried 5P-6K (Whiff)-66PRC-623P? its a good frametrap cancel into command grab
[3:23:37] <leith_aziz> I've seen Nago players do the teleport cancel into buttons. Usually, they teleport a bit then instantl start attacking again
[3:23:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:23:38] <+chadwicktouchdown> @Blank9 thought visceral was dissolved into ea?
[3:23:47] <leith_aziz> @Blank9 Not by Visceral
[3:24:00] <HarpuiaRivers> What do you usually do against Millia as Nago? That seems like a rough match up
[3:24:07] <leith_aziz> at least the ones making the remake from what I've heard
[3:24:25] <NotHereToStream> chicken block against millia from what i've heard, its a goddamn fly swatting match
[3:24:34] <+chadwicktouchdown> play me uwu
[3:24:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> The studio behind the new Deadspace is the guys that did Battlefront 2 and Squadrons
[3:24:41] <laguerrilha> Oh boy Axl vs Nago
[3:24:47] <extradopeness> i saw a street fighter cookbook earlier today i almost bought it
[3:24:53] <+Nuclearcherries> @RenoDeGeneric Just Squadrons, DICE did Battlefront 2
[3:24:54] <leith_aziz> I'd love to play since im on PC, but you may not be content with my connection
[3:25:01] <MayorRev> might pick this up in the future
[3:25:07] <+chadwicktouchdown> @RenoDeGeneric those were beautiful games, it is a full remake tho, probably going to have changes
[3:25:08] <DianaTheAscian> it's a painful matchup
[3:25:17] <ElPlasa> Axl intro is so fucking godlike
[3:25:18] <2thre3> Lakers Nago lets go
[3:25:19] <+chadwicktouchdown> @leith_aziz west cosat?
[3:25:24] <leith_aziz> I usually have a hard time stopping Pot players as Nago
[3:25:29] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz EU
[3:25:32] <Clundy> @renodegeneric I bet they‚Äôre gonna remake the trash blaster turret sequence into a dogfight
[3:25:36] <+chadwicktouchdown> ah
[3:25:41] <laguerrilha> @MayorRev its great to start playing FG since the tutorials cover all but frame data
[3:25:51] <leith_aziz> Nice
[3:25:55] <meatman_noplan> nice
[3:25:57] <%Wydamn> bringing it back!

[3:27:11] <+chadwicktouchdown> thoughts on steam deck for locals?
[3:27:19] <extradopeness> can we talk about goldlewis
[3:27:27] <leith_aziz> @chadwicktouchdown seems to fix the PC issue for tourneys
[3:27:30] <+chadwicktouchdown> @extradopeness you mean heavy from tf2?
[3:27:38] <leith_aziz> @extradopeness Sure. He looks great
[3:27:41] <+RenoDeGeneric> As an Axl player, getting hit my other people's burstsafe combos is soulcrushing lol
[3:27:43] <extradopeness> why is his name goldlewis
[3:27:48] <Dopamien> POOTISPENSERHERE
[3:27:50] <leith_aziz> im already expecting a Heavy mod on week 1
[3:27:56] <+Nuclearcherries> Oh for sure
[3:27:59] <leith_aziz> @extradopeness Iron Maiden refrence
[3:28:01] <MayorRev> he's lewis.... but gold
[3:28:04] <+chadwicktouchdown> has there been any full model replacement mods?
[3:28:11] <Equirah> @leith_aziz it's already done and ready to deploy LUL
[3:28:14] <leith_aziz> I don't what part of Iron Maiden it refrences though
[3:28:26] <Equirah> @chadwicktouchdown yeah but not many are shared
[3:28:29] <meatman_noplan> Has moveset swaps been done yet? I need to see some Street Fighter 4 tier skeleton stretches.
[3:28:31] <leith_aziz> @chadwicktouchdown There's a mod that imports Sol's Xrd model into Strive
[3:28:33] <Applecannon63> The fact Goldlewis is a secretary of the senator now a president of the US that took a bullet and still stands
[3:28:36] <leith_aziz> Strive mods are LOADED
[3:28:37] <+chadwicktouchdown> @chadwicktouchdown i've actually only gone to smash locals, so im excited to go to actual fgc tourneys, hopefully i can go to next years evo or sumn
[3:28:40] <extradopeness> i had a feeling it was a reference
[3:28:51] <+RenoDeGeneric> Goldlewis' last name is shared with the lead singer of Iron Maiden, iunno about his first name
[3:28:51] <ElPlasa> @chadwicktouchdown Potsugeki, Berseker armor Ky, Alphonse Potemkin, there's quite a bunch actually
[3:28:57] <leith_aziz> @meatman_noplan There are gattling change mods
[3:28:59] <%Wydamn> oof that ending
[3:29:11] <Equirah> @chadwicktouchdown you have pepsiman sol, power ranger leo, blade nago, and some others
[3:29:14] <Applecannon63> So Goldlewis has a resource meter
[3:29:19] <2thre3> @RenoDeGeneric It's not the same spelling and the guy's name is Bruce Dickinson
[3:29:24] <+RealPT1> can you buffer super inputs on BRC flash?
[3:29:26] <leith_aziz> FUllmetal Alchemist Pot
[3:29:30] <leith_aziz> *Fullmetal
[3:29:32] <dromemer3> Don't get mad, GET GOOD!!
[3:29:43] <+chadwicktouchdown> i dont want to get mods cause i know once i get one ill get all of them
[3:29:45] <extradopeness> yeah i was gonna say im p sure i know bruce dickinson and blase bailey
[3:29:48] <+RealPT1> or was that all before the BRC
[3:29:49] <KaiserMario> Do Axls use timestop often?
[3:29:50] <Equirah> @leith_aziz pls don't incentivise the use of that, could be the end for mods
[3:30:05] <2thre3> @extradopeness Blaze was there when I proposed to my wife
[3:30:07] <Applecannon63> Lewison has a resource memter for his Area 51 coffin
[3:30:08] <%Deft_Thought> I miss this track
[3:30:13] <leith_aziz> My only question about mods is that there's a mod that lets you use the PS colors, BUT otehr players can see that mod. Is it fine to use them?
[3:30:16] <Equirah> @Applecannon63 yup, an alien meter
[3:30:19] <%JaseAdrift> @KaiserMario not really its kind of a waste of meter
[3:30:28] <KaiserMario> Weird
[3:30:44] <CarelessWhimper> I see then Ninja Genlteman sets paying off :D
[3:30:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[3:30:47] <leith_aziz> @KaiserMario They never do it because they wanna save meter for RC or wakeup super. It's sad seeing a cool super never used
[3:30:56] <Equirah> *big no
[3:31:00] <leith_aziz> I've installed a DMC2 Chipp mod. Looked sick
[3:31:01] <Dopamien> @leith_aziz other players shouldn't be able to see them?
[3:31:02] <extradopeness> @2thre3 thats awesome! congratulations!
[3:31:07] <+chadwicktouchdown> can you combo into timestop?
[3:31:13] <Equirah> @leith_aziz big no on that one
[3:31:13] <ThatButler> Going against axle is suffering
[3:31:14] <%JaseAdrift> yes
[3:31:15] <ThatButler> and yeah
[3:31:21] <Equirah> mods plz it was a typo LUL
[3:31:26] <leith_aziz> @Dopamien They can see those colors specifically since all the mod does is make them available. They're already in the game
[3:31:29] <+chadwicktouchdown> cause whenever I see it i just block
[3:31:33] <+TopTieramisu> scrappy
[3:31:33] <NotHereToStream> got a lot of meter there
[3:31:38] <%Irridium> gg's
[3:31:40] <BR0Speedwagon> Is Woolie doing an open lobby today?
[3:31:47] <%Deft_Thought> Sometimes you gotta Beyblade
[3:31:53] <2thre3> @extradopeness Going back a few years now... he tried kidnapping my friend Michaela into his tour bus for lols too... he's a fucnny guy. Yeah... best night of my life.
[3:31:54] <+chadwicktouchdown> open lobby o.o
[3:32:06] <ElPlasa> @WoolieVersus One thing DEB said on twitter for this matchup is that FD in the air makes you fall quicker, which helps to make up rensengeki less favourable
[3:32:11] <Applecannon63> I hope once Strive's next update they return ex moves/supers from XXAccent Core and Xrd
[3:32:17] <Equirah> @leith_aziz to put it simply any mod that isn't player side isn't safe to use
[3:32:31] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Ex moves werent in Xrd. Xrd had Burst Super
[3:32:37] <%Deft_Thought> Oh, I like that Axl color
[3:32:37] <Applecannon63> by ex supers I mean Burst Super
[3:32:39] <leith_aziz> @Equirah I see, Thanks for the warning
[3:32:41] <Dopamien> @Dopamien I get what you mean, maybe avoid those
[3:32:45] <NotHereToStream> you could fast rc that grab
[3:32:51] <NotHereToStream> into 5c.S
[3:32:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MY PASSWORD IS OUT OF THE
[3:32:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BOXXXXXX
[3:32:56] <%JaseAdrift> id like to see them add moves
[3:33:03] <+RenoDeGeneric> 2004 all Denim Axl
[3:33:03] <+chadwicktouchdown> axl whats the wifi password
[3:33:06] <extradopeness> @2thre3 well thats fucked i knew he was a creep but i wouldnt wanna take away from your moment
[3:33:08] <leith_aziz> I can tsee Burst super being put in Strive simply because of the high damage
[3:33:11] <ElPlasa> @AlteisenReiseZ omw to steal your wifi
[3:33:14] <leith_aziz> *can't see
[3:33:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @AlteisenReiseZ pls no
[3:33:30] <pixel_river> i can only imagnine what insta kills would look like in this
[3:33:37] <Applecannon63> I mean Burst could add more chip
[3:33:38] <ElPlasa> NICEEEEEEEEEE
[3:33:38] <leith_aziz> I love the musical genre variety in the OST
[3:33:41] <yukichocomilk> I swear everyone plays gio or ky or nago LUL I fight them so much
[3:33:43] <+RenoDeGeneric> Lmao that's so cruel
[3:33:44] <+Cobaltor_252> god DAMN
[3:33:46] <ThatButler> Just remember, an airthrow is only a 2 frame investment.
[3:33:48] <+jepupu> Axl vs big bodies = j.S galore
[3:34:03] <leith_aziz> I've only been able to stop Axl players with Sol and Chipp
[3:34:19] <2thre3> @extradopeness Ahhhh no, it wasn't like that. We'd been drinking for about 4hrs after my wife had said yes. We were just pissing about and he was like "Right lads, I'm off... *walks round the table and picks my mate up on his way out"
[3:34:27] <extradopeness> lmaooooo ok
[3:34:30] <+jepupu> Zato vs Axl is interesting
[3:34:31] <Equirah> i got two pot busters in row on an axl once, made my day
[3:34:47] <Applecannon63> If only Axl had a checkmate move while using his time stop move
[3:34:58] <leith_aziz> Yep. that's why they never use the time super. They save for the wakeup
[3:35:09] <Ziegsy> is this one track or does it keep changing?
[3:35:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> Well that and the time super is kinda bad
[3:35:19] <pixel_river> i have trouble against millias
[3:35:24] <%JaseAdrift> Wakeup super is like the only thing axl has to protect himself in the corner
[3:35:28] <+jepupu> You can set your music as random
[3:35:31] <%AmuserName> this Axl should really be using his 5k and 2k more..
[3:35:36] <leith_aziz> @Ziegsy On rematch, the same track keeps playing. Once he gets into the lobby again, a different song plays
[3:35:36] <MayorRev> yoooooo
[3:35:38] <CarelessWhimper> This Axl desperately neats to read your blood meter
[3:35:41] <MayorRev> that was rad
[3:35:52] <extradopeness> @2thre3 ahhh sorry to get alarmed. that is kinda funny actually.
[3:35:56] <%invalid_robin> How long is Woolie going to be going with Strive?
[3:36:15] <Ziegsy> @leith_aziz ty! it just seemed like multiple songs xD
[3:36:17] <leith_aziz> I think Axl should just be able to use his time super whenever. It's not as broken as people think at this point
[3:36:28] <leith_aziz> he shouldnt have to install it first
[3:36:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> Issue with the time super is that you need two openings within 5-6 seconds or it'll fizzle
[3:36:39] <2thre3> @extradopeness I tell this story everytime I get a chance... Honestly an amazing night. Thanks for listening LUL
[3:36:45] <CarelessWhimper> Your command grabs are pretty telegraphed because you go for them whenever you're about to pop, but this british twink is terified of you
[3:36:47] <%baka_sugoi> baka_sugoi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:37:18] <Equirah> in what world is axl a twink?
[3:37:29] <CarelessWhimper> In mine, i s'pose
[3:37:35] <leith_aziz> Be glad this ain't Axl with shorts. ugh...
[3:37:46] <+wumpy3d> what is nago's worst matchup?
[3:37:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:37:48] <CarelessWhimper> I have heard tales of Jortxl
[3:37:52] <%baka_sugoi> @leith_aziz JORTS
[3:37:53] <leith_aziz> They gave him the right design this time around
[3:38:04] <+jepupu> Axl's not a twink in a world where Bridget exists.
[3:38:10] <meatman_noplan> noice
[3:38:10] <Applecannon63> Just because Axl has ripped legs doesn't make him a twunk
[3:38:12] <ThatButler> poor Nago, Years of overeating onigiri has given him such high blood pressure.
[3:38:15] <%JaseAdrift> Nago has a tough time against Good Axls
[3:38:30] <CarelessWhimper> I mean idk bridgets gender identity :P @jepupu
[3:38:33] <CarelessWhimper> ANY WAYS
[3:38:38] <leith_aziz> @CarelessWhimper Bridget's male
[3:38:39] <CarelessWhimper> I did not intend to start discourse
[3:38:40] <extradopeness> paige tagged you in a tweet woolie its VERY cursed
[3:38:46] <%JaseAdrift> Bridget is max Twink
[3:38:47] <+chadwicktouchdown> nago fucking destroys ino
[3:38:49] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz Gender. Identity. :P
[3:38:55] <CarelessWhimper> Lets move on tho
[3:39:13] <leith_aziz> @CarelessWhimper No, I think he sees himself as a boy. His parents just hide his true gender
[3:39:16] <+Cuon_Alpinus> 420
[3:39:19] <leith_aziz> but moving on
[3:39:28] <+jepupu> If Bridget is cheating, Venom and Testament slide further than Axl do also.
[3:39:33] <+RenoDeGeneric> 420 BLAZING
[3:39:35] <+chadwicktouchdown> remember jab the overheads
[3:39:37] <BlackermanZX> lvl 1090 monkaS
[3:39:46] <%Deft_Thought> I'm not happy with I-No in Strive
[3:39:55] <leith_aziz> I have not been able to deal with I-No's well
[3:39:58] <Applecannon63> Bridget's story is about him proving a superstition that males are badluck to his homeland
[3:39:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Ino scary
[3:40:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> This is just a slap fight
[3:40:00] <CarelessWhimper> Main nago i've been playing v is complaining mainly about Mays, but idk if she's his worst MU for whoever asked
[3:40:04] <%Deft_Thought> She's tough
[3:40:04] <+jepupu> I-no just needs a bit of buffing.
[3:40:14] <%invalid_robin> Ino needs better combo paths
[3:40:14] <extradopeness> im learning I-No finally her dashes have always been such a hurdle for me
[3:40:15] <ThatButler> Yep, that's an I-no round
[3:40:32] <%Deft_Thought> She doesn't get a lot of damage off of a knock-down, but her mix-up game is spooky
[3:40:36] <%JaseAdrift> I-no Vs nago is a weird match up
[3:40:37] <Applecannon63> *proving that the superstition made from his homeland is bullshit
[3:40:45] <CarelessWhimper> I-no is terrifying, but like, she's SFV Laura (So is Anji and Gio but disregard), she has to reset a bunch of times to kill you unlike the top tiers
[3:40:50] <%Deft_Thought> Being able to modify her jump makes her a serious threat
[3:41:00] <%invalid_robin> @Deft_Thought Sadly she can't really do much off a mixup, from what I've seen at least. Which is sad
[3:41:06] <Applecannon63> but yeah gonna move on
[3:41:16] <Equirah> @Applecannon63 not just males but "two males", briget has an older brother
[3:41:18] <leith_aziz> I-No is that type of character who's not THAT strong, but you DON'T wanna see how you can deal with her if she got buffed
[3:41:21] <ThatButler> She can do enough mixups though.
[3:41:33] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Yup. She doesn't hit hard because she gets to hop all over you
[3:41:36] <+bad_luck_luke> oof
[3:41:38] <+TopTieramisu> holy
[3:41:40] <+chadwicktouchdown> @Deft_Thought off a mix up you get another mixup
[3:41:42] <%Deft_Thought> I just wish her gameplan felt more interesting to play
[3:41:45] <BlackermanZX> schmixed
[3:41:47] <leith_aziz> @Equirah Yeah, it's like a culture there that having two brothers in a family is cursed
[3:41:52] <CarelessWhimper> @invalid_robin Her mixup game is good, dash h is a fake overhead into grab/megalo, or a low, or actually letting it come out
[3:41:53] <+chadwicktouchdown> he just tried double HCL
[3:41:54] <ThatButler> This is basically how every I-no vs nago match goes so far
[3:41:55] <%JaseAdrift> put the fear of pressing buttons into you
[3:41:59] <Applecannon63> Huh forgot about the brother
[3:42:00] <CarelessWhimper> @invalid_robin She has hella mixes
[3:42:01] <Majestic_Flof> thats brutal
[3:42:06] <ThatButler> If she ever gets momentum, Nago loses the chance for a turn
[3:42:09] <BlackermanZX> goddamn ino pressure is crazy
[3:42:14] <+Nuclearcherries> Damn they're good
[3:42:26] <%SirGO0SE> so this is how ino is played LUL
[3:42:31] <extradopeness> alright i-no play tsumi to batsu
[3:42:38] <leith_aziz> Reminder that II-No was Top 5 in Rev 2
[3:42:44] <leith_aziz> *I-No
[3:42:57] <%livlinn> "Gotta kill her before that happens" Woolie 2021
[3:43:13] <valiard> @HoodToku was suspended by twitter i am the sadge
[3:43:14] <+chadwicktouchdown> i wonder why this ino is doing 2k into dash
[3:43:20] <leith_aziz> When I-No has meter, I just keep jumping. im not gonna let her get that command grab
[3:43:22] <CarelessWhimper> Her pressure is good :D But she's a lot more honest than she feels, i think. Gio and I-No players are gonna run into the problem of people knowing how they play with time, same as an SFV Laura, meaning that only brain geniuses will end up doing the rounds with her
[3:43:52] <leith_aziz> @CarelessWhimper Well, Gio just has good buttons. Her mixup is a bit linear, but she'll do well nontheless
[3:43:55] <HUGOMASTRPICE> Get them woolie
[3:44:08] <%Deft_Thought> @CarelessWhimper Fer real. 5P and 6P deals with a lot of her business on a good number of the cast.
[3:44:18] <leith_aziz> But I agree that people will learn to deal with Giovanna
[3:44:22] <%Deft_Thought> Nice
[3:44:23] <meatman_noplan> ah hah
[3:44:24] <pixel_river> nice
[3:44:34] <%Deft_Thought> This Nago ain't free, baby
[3:44:41] <+chadwicktouchdown> @CarelessWhimper yeah if you have a good jab ino is fucked
[3:44:42] <%livlinn> Suteki shiaGasm
[3:44:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Bearzone
[3:44:45] <meatman_noplan> good catch
[3:44:45] <leith_aziz> Good
[3:44:49] <+wumpy3d> scary
[3:44:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:44:51] <extradopeness> i just scream 6p at all my life problems
[3:44:52] <NotHereToStream> nice
[3:44:54] <%JaseAdrift> this looks stressful
[3:44:54] <+chadwicktouchdown> woolie just jabbed her out of pressure like 6 times that round
[3:44:56] <%Exiliator> nice
[3:44:57] <NotHereToStream> just got to challenge her
[3:45:04] <+TopTieramisu> paper beats rock and roll
[3:45:16] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz I mean, yeah, i haven't lost to a Gio in like, more than a week XD her crossup being always jabable as anji, her having an issue of getting in from full screen, etc, i think that i-no and gio are gonna struggle with reactive play improving
[3:45:17] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah, jabs really hurt her approach in a lot of situations
[3:45:30] <%Deft_Thought> GORI
[3:45:32] <meatman_noplan> SMOrc
[3:45:35] <+wumpy3d> who gives nago the most trouble?
[3:45:42] <+chadwicktouchdown> beyblade beats stroke
[3:45:45] <leith_aziz> @wumpy3d Sol apparently. That and Axl
[3:45:50] <CarelessWhimper> @wumpy3d i hear may, but i don't play him
[3:45:52] <+jepupu> Gorilla time.
[3:45:57] <%Deft_Thought> @chadwicktouchdown #letitrip
[3:46:21] <leith_aziz> Sol Vs Leo is the most hilarious matchup in the game. Tied with SOl Vs Sol
[3:46:23] <Applecannon63> Burly Heart baby
[3:46:27] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Gio does not have issues getting in
[3:46:28] <+chadwicktouchdown> i wish there were combo challenges in strive
[3:46:34] <CarelessWhimper> I think Nago is like, in an extremely strange position of being an incredibly good character with a bunch of bad matchups, somehow wxlfgaLUL
[3:46:37] <%Deft_Thought> 5S is Nago's sword thrust, right?
[3:46:45] <extradopeness> Donkey Kong: STRIVE
[3:46:52] <+RenoDeGeneric> yeah 5S is the long ass sword poke
[3:46:55] <leith_aziz> @chadwicktouchdown A Combo Maker mode is planned to come out in the future, which will likely be better than a simple combo list
[3:46:55] <ThatButler> Fun fact. Nago wins the projectile war against leo.
[3:47:02] <%invalid_robin> @CarelessWhimper Agree. In any other fighting game he would be at the top of most tournaments
[3:47:19] <+chadwicktouchdown> @chadwicktouchdown oh i just think theyre fun
[3:47:34] <zenith0111> Potemkin can reflect Nagos Clone
[3:47:34] <leith_aziz> Nago is character that's already good, but he cant spam his specials to much
[3:47:35] <+RenoDeGeneric> Slick backdash
[3:47:36] <leith_aziz> *too
[3:47:45] <+chadwicktouchdown> i played a leo yesterday that would dp literally every wakeup
[3:47:50] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 She sure does, the gios i knock out of tourneys would love to disagree :D Her mixup is linear, run up kicks is fine and puts you in a mixup, but she has to get there
[3:47:51] <ThatButler> Ooh nice.
[3:47:52] <+wumpy3d> clean
[3:47:55] <nailwind> those were some classic canadian bursts last match
[3:47:55] <+RenoDeGeneric> Oh my god bless this man through his fireball
[3:48:19] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Pressure is sometimes arguably better then mixups potential
[3:48:21] <leith_aziz> @chadwicktouchdown It means they community instead will make up different combo challenges themselves and share it for everyone to try. Sounds fun
[3:48:23] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 its not like she's terrible, but v people who know her limited options she struggles more than a lot of the cast
[3:48:25] <extradopeness> THE RCS
[3:48:31] <HUGOMASTRPICE> NO fera, ONE FEAR
[3:48:32] <Equirah> grab him inn the dash trhough
[3:48:33] <+chadwicktouchdown> @chadwicktouchdown oh if theres a share feature that'd be great
[3:48:35] <NotHereToStream> if the dp doesn't hit, do it again, gorilla rules
[3:48:40] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 I dunno what you mean with that response :P
[3:48:42] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper I dont think you played a single good Gio then
[3:48:46] <+Nuclearcherries> That was good burst timing
[3:48:47] <leith_aziz> @chadwicktouchdown That's the idea it seems
[3:49:03] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 I mean... That's pretty disrespectful to celestial gios but i guess?

[3:49:34] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz its so awkward XD Early on i thought it was an overhead
[3:49:46] <NotHereToStream> round start dp big brain
[3:49:49] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 I mean, idk if you understand my critique.
[3:49:50] <%Deft_Thought> JUST DO IT says Leo
[3:49:50] <extradopeness> surprise attacl!
[3:49:53] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Isnt it more disrespectful to beat them and call the character bad?
[3:49:54] <Equirah> i need that combo practice mode cause i just feel aimless in training mode
[3:50:06] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 Have i called the character bad?
[3:50:11] <leith_aziz> @Deft_Thought Sin's theme is litterarly called "Just do it"
[3:50:11] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL swatted
[3:50:14] <%Deft_Thought> He just lost his mind
[3:50:19] <+fetrigon> like a fly
[3:50:23] <+Nuclearcherries> Today he will learn
[3:50:29] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper When youre saying she struggles at her best gameplan then yes
[3:50:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> I fought a celestial leo that did that on EVERY wakeup
[3:50:33] <Equirah> why can't i fight ppl like him on fllor 8? LUL
[3:50:35] <leith_aziz> Leo and Sol players will give up on defense. This is coming from a Sol main
[3:50:39] <leith_aziz> we HATE blocking
[3:50:40] <KidKaiser23> That last lil move where you slammed him on the ground was HAWT
[3:50:44] <+fetrigon> omfg
[3:50:46] <+wumpy3d> lmao
[3:50:51] <%JaseAdrift> He just didnt want to block
[3:50:52] <%Deft_Thought> Did they fix Nago's super dropping folks out?
[3:50:53] <%townzzzzz> I felt that
[3:50:53] <+RenoDeGeneric> gottem
[3:50:53] <leith_aziz> True words
[3:50:54] <CheyMix> NOW ITS TIME
[3:50:57] <CheyMix> TO FEAST
[3:50:58] <HUGOMASTRPICE> NICE
[3:50:58] <extradopeness> my god man you killed him!
[3:51:00] <KidKaiser23> Lmaoooo
[3:51:10] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 And her best gameplan that i've said she's bad at is what? :P
[3:51:14] <CheyMix> ps4?
[3:51:23] <CheyMix> i mean 5
[3:51:23] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Getting in
[3:51:24] <Applecannon63> Why Ky is low tier is it because he's basic shoto?
[3:51:34] <CheyMix> ky is honest
[3:51:34] <leith_aziz> That quote is gonna fit perfectly once Jack-O gets in lol
[3:51:36] <extradopeness> EYE TO EYE DONT BE FAKE
[3:51:40] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 matchup specific issues
[3:51:43] <extradopeness> KEEP IT REAL!
[3:51:46] <Equirah> yeah, ky doesn't have much, a standard kit
[3:51:55] <KidKaiser23> Yes! One of fav GG tracks!!!
[3:51:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:51:55] <%CptnCampy61> CptnCampy61 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:51:57] <meatman_noplan> Stop beating around da :b:oosh
[3:51:58] <+trashamn> Ky is too honest he doesnt have anyhting he can really abuse
[3:52:02] <leith_aziz> Ky also has a lot of recovery to his moves
[3:52:05] <%Deft_Thought> Eye to eyeeeee
[3:52:10] <CheyMix> if the arc move was an overhead tho
[3:52:17] <leith_aziz> But in all honesty, I think Ky's like low md tier. Not low tier
[3:52:17] <Equirah> and his DI is just horrible LUL
[3:52:25] <leith_aziz> You can do fine with Ky
[3:52:25] <CheyMix> that would give some oprtions
[3:52:26] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 My criticism is that she has a limited amount of ways to get in, which can be contested if they're read, meaning that she will struggle in particular as matchup knowledge grows :P
[3:52:30] <CheyMix> options*
[3:52:31] <zenith0111> DI shouldnt give meter penalty
[3:52:49] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 her overheads can be jabbed on startup, same with combo-extender spiral arrow
[3:52:51] <leith_aziz> I would just remove the health limit for DI. He can use it whenever
[3:52:58] <extradopeness> the bass in this song is just groovin
[3:53:03] <KidKaiser23> O O F
[3:53:14] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 Run-up kicks is strong, but if you read it you can farm her for counters. Do you disagree with any of that? :P
[3:53:17] <leith_aziz> Sol's DI wasnt good, but you could do it whenever. Was good for closing out a round at least
[3:53:19] <%Deft_Thought> @extradopeness It's such a good track
[3:53:21] <+wumpy3d> clean
[3:53:24] <leith_aziz> I just loved using Sol's DI
[3:53:26] <ThatButler> Das some good grabbin'
[3:53:28] <Kitsunerasu> also make DI gain meter at a slower amount rather than you stop gaining meter
[3:53:32] <Applecannon63> Didn't Ky in XRD had a wierd glyph gimmick?
[3:53:39] <CheyMix> you really gotta jab when gio runs at you huh?
[3:53:39] <NotHereToStream> yes he did
[3:53:43] <KidKaiser23> Nice Chompin, Woolz
[3:53:43] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Everything you said is so bad and wrong.
[3:53:49] <+trashamn> yeah the grinders were fun :(
[3:53:54] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 You a gio player? :P
[3:53:55] <extradopeness> BUSSIN
[3:53:55] <Equirah> @Applecannon63 yeah, if you did a projectile through it it would power up
[3:54:05] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper No
[3:54:10] <Equirah> including the super
[3:54:13] <extradopeness> These bursts lmao
[3:54:19] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 If Ky got IK'd or got damaged enough, his full hair'll show up and Holy Orders III will start playing. That what you mean?
[3:54:24] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:54:31] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 oh no, you meant something else
[3:54:32] <brisk_dacat> Wonder if Nago enjoy a particular character blood the most?
[3:54:33] <leith_aziz> Sorry
[3:54:51] <leith_aziz> @brisk_dacat Well he loves Onigiri, so something to that staste
[3:54:55] <leith_aziz> *taste
[3:55:04] <KidKaiser23> You‚Äôve really improved on when you slide in and out wit Nago, keep it up!!!
[3:55:06] <CheyMix> @brisk_dacat vegan blood must taste like sprite
[3:55:15] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Just one of the top 3 Axls on psn.. whos had 1,000 of matches in celestial.
[3:55:18] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 aight, nvm, will move on, you haven't made arguments other than gone "no >:(" when i'm literally out here making vip gios struggle and making the mild point that she will struggle as people figure her out wxlfgaLUL
[3:55:41] <leith_aziz> WOW
[3:55:46] <meatman_noplan> tricked 'um
[3:55:46] <+Cuon_Alpinus> the reads
[3:55:48] <%Deft_Thought> Nice
[3:55:50] <+Canti510> can't be pressing buttons
[3:55:52] <CheyMix> damn
[3:55:53] <Applecannon63> Like why couldn't they brought back that gimmick? also Ky should've had long hair when goes DI with Holy Order or Magnolia Eclair theme added
[3:55:56] <leith_aziz> You're damn good with Nago. Gotta say that
[3:55:59] <KidKaiser23> Dramatic Finish!
[3:56:29] <+Canti510> Tempestade is plus and good for making the approach
[3:56:34] <%JaseAdrift> OOF shouldnt have used the burst
[3:56:36] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 I want Holy Orders III to play on DI, but he doesnt need his long hair. He looks better with short hair personally
[3:56:37] <CheyMix> @Applecannon63 ky has long hair in 2 games out of the total 7 or something in the sieres
[3:56:38] <+Canti510> fucking safe super to throw out
[3:56:42] <+yoscribe> That air super is +5
[3:56:43] <+Nuclearcherries> Love the people casually having coffee in the back
[3:56:43] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 Okay? I mean i'd hope you could poke her overheads at that point but aight. Again, at no point have i said she's bad, and you aren't contesting anything i say directly so this is a waste of everyones time
[3:56:44] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Saying No pretty much says it all tho.
[3:56:52] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 No :)
[3:57:11] <ThatButler> Playing around wakeup supers is always the worst.
[3:57:17] <Dopamien> @CarelessWhimper I'm not celestial but I've had some success with run up kicks with delayed gattlings. Depends if they know whats coming obviously
[3:57:30] <meatman_noplan> Pootykins!
[3:57:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> GG Woolie
[3:57:34] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper Youre just projecting at this point
[3:57:41] <+RenoDeGeneric> atpRtsd
[3:57:43] <CarelessWhimper> @Dopamien Exactly my point, yup :P Like, her best stuff is something that can be played around
[3:57:44] <CheyMix> *bussy*
[3:57:45] <CheyMix> why
[3:57:46] <meatman_noplan> oh god
[3:57:49] <CheyMix> just...why
[3:57:49] <%JaseAdrift> this potemkin is BUSSIN
[3:57:53] <extradopeness> lmao
[3:57:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> üÖ±Ô∏èussy
[3:58:03] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 You literally couldn't explain in what way, which is funny
[3:58:03] <extradopeness> bustin makes me feel good!
[3:58:06] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 But to answer your question, it's clear that a lot of small thing were left on the cutting room floor thanks to c-vid. It's why character specific themes are not in the game I'd say
[3:58:08] <ElPlasa> w h y
[3:58:27] <CarelessWhimper> Who else is excited for Goldlewis tho üëÄ
[3:58:29] <Dopamien> @CarelessWhimper its a struggle to find overheads FeelsBadMan
[3:58:30] <+anoldtoilet> this is my fav matchup i nthe game
[3:58:35] <+anoldtoilet> also yes Goldlewis main here
[3:58:49] <%JaseAdrift> Goldlewis looks sick
[3:58:50] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 My hope os that they're added later on with other stuff like IK's
[3:58:55] <Frogwash> Goldlewis' 6h is too op tbh
[3:58:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19

[3:59:05] <+RenoDeGeneric> Grabbing a Potemkin is illegal
[3:59:07] <leith_aziz> I'll try Goldlewis personally. Welcome cool new characters

[3:59:09] <KaiserMario> Gold Dick looks pretty cool

[3:59:18] <leith_aziz> IM A FOOL I KNOW NOTHING
[3:59:30] <leith_aziz> BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON LIFE
[3:59:39] <leith_aziz> ONE DAY ALL WILL ROT AWAT
[3:59:40] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper By assuming im struggling fighting against her moves that I think are better than what youre saying
[3:59:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @leith_aziz
[3:59:52] <%townzzzzz> ARMOR CLAD FAITH
[3:59:55] <CarelessWhimper> @Dopamien Seriously, i loved SFV Laura due to liking pressure/mixup/grapple characters, but people being able to just jab your mixups is what has me worrying XD
[4:00:06] <+anoldtoilet> megafisto
[4:00:14] <leith_aziz> THIS IS FOR OUR FUTURE
[4:00:15] <zenith0111> just because I think a move is good doesnt mean its something I personally would struggle against but still respect its strength
[4:00:19] <VJdarkworld> MEGAfisto
[4:00:38] <leith_aziz> Once I reached Celestial I realised how scary Garuda Impact is
[4:00:53] <+anoldtoilet> poggers
[4:00:57] <extradopeness> garuda impact is so damn good bro
[4:00:58] <+anoldtoilet> good shit woolie
[4:01:01] <leith_aziz> it will chipp you to death if you're too patient. That or make you guess a 50/50
[4:01:04] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 And how is that... Projecting? Am i struggling against them? ü§î
[4:01:13] <Equirah> this pot is.....
[4:01:35] <Equirah> and yes, i'm aware i played like ass on stream LUL
[4:01:36] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Do you think you could get back a ft10 on Pat now?
[4:01:37] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper No thatd be coping then
[4:01:59] <+anoldtoilet> woolie would 9/10 him comfortably rn i think
[4:02:02] <CheyMix> man nago looks fun
[4:02:10] <+anoldtoilet> pat's barely played and woolie has been labbing his ass off
[4:02:19] <leith_aziz> @KaiserMario Is Pat still playing? It sounded like he's focusing on some people not liking the game or something?
[4:02:39] <CarelessWhimper> @zenith0111 I say that i can consistently deal with a move, you say "no you cant", so i take that to mean that you cant :P If you had said "No, because of x setup" or "y factor" then i wouldn't think that :P But hey, gl
[4:02:49] <Equirah> hasn't flciked once
[4:02:51] <brisk_dacat> Pats life is virtual cards now
[4:02:52] <Dopamien> @CarelessWhimper he good mixups are at dash range imo. if they're close enough to mash jab I would be in a bad spot
[4:03:07] <+codgear14> codgear14 subscribed with Prime. 
[4:03:08] <KaiserMario> Idk if Pat's playing at all, but he's a very good player overall, I think he could still give Woolie some trouble
[4:03:20] <thefranchise00> mental guard break
[4:03:26] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper If thats how think the conversation went then youre just retarded
[4:03:34] <WickedTwizzler> woolie be showing his knowledge of this matchup FeelsGoodMan
[4:03:36] <leith_aziz> I cant stop Potemkin from Megafisting in neutral
[4:03:36] <+fetrigon> LUL
[4:03:40] <CheyMix> lol
[4:03:42] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[4:03:45] <CheyMix> fuck that shield
[4:03:50] <leith_aziz> That was funny

[4:04:22] <+anoldtoilet> just heavy through that bitch
[4:04:36] <+anoldtoilet> nago played well looks so clean. what a cool char
[4:04:46] <Applecannon63> I still hope Potemkin gets his old Heat Knuckle and Giganter/Aegis Reflector Follow up
[4:05:09] <zenith0111> @carelesswhimper
[4:05:11] <CarelessWhimper> @Dopamien Yee, playing chicken is where she thrives for sure. Like, being far away and in peoples face if you aren't currently making them block just seems like you get very low reward off of anything that isn't risky/unsafe
[4:05:52] <+Blueberryfists> man i hate these lobbies. i hope there's a chance arcsys changes them
[4:06:00] <extradopeness> sushi! sukiyaki! BANZAIIIIII!
[4:06:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:06:08] <CarelessWhimper> @Blueberryfists wouldn't get my hopes up :D
[4:06:08] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 The Heat Knuckle change seemed to just be a nice QoL change. It had it's utility, but I think it was a harmless change (this is what I think personally of course)
[4:06:26] <%JaseAdrift> Doubt Arcsys will ever change the lobbies at this point
[4:06:28] <CheyMix> ninja on that ass
[4:06:54] <CheyMix> the lobbies will get better in stability down the line if anything but no. they will never be basic menus
[4:06:58] <ThatButler> Delicious dust
[4:07:02] <zenith0111> Heat Knuckle wallbreaks. if it was a frab again wed be calling Potemkin top 3
[4:07:09] <zenith0111> grab*
[4:07:13] <CheyMix> im pretty sure thats just how they are. they like doing things diffrent
[4:07:16] <+RenoDeGeneric> Good ol Chipp "Instant Burst" Zanuff
[4:07:21] <CheyMix> which is chaming in some ways
[4:07:26] <leith_aziz> @Blueberryfists I dont think so? They're planning on adding more avatars and probably trying to make something more out of the lobby. Sorry. Let's just hope it becomes more stable and quicker to use
[4:07:33] <kojanga> uptime
[4:07:46] <kojanga> !uptime
[4:07:46] <@Moobot> @kojanga WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 20 minutes
[4:07:46] <+Canti510> I'll tolerate the lobby system but implement a lobby refresh so I can see some new players if everyone already happens to be fighting
[4:08:01] <CarelessWhimper> I do hope they fix stagelag tho
[4:08:15] <+s0lesurviv0r> What BGM is playing? a GG1 ending theme?
[4:08:15] <leith_aziz> @CheyMix I did find the Rev 2 lobbies charming, but I think soemtiems Arcsys lobbies can get in the way and they spend way too much time on them when that work could go to something else
[4:08:24] <+s0lesurviv0r> can't quite place it
[4:08:32] <leith_aziz> @s0lesurviv0r I think this could be GG1's May theme?
[4:08:40] <CarelessWhimper> Like, i consequently refuse to be p2 in ranked cus the chances of the matches being under water is too high. I'm done with SFV
[4:08:57] <ElPlasa> NICE 6P
[4:08:58] <CheyMix> @CheyMix thats what i mean thats thats how they are. cant blame them for trying to do things fresh
[4:08:59] <CarelessWhimper> no more CFN wxlfgaLUL
[4:09:04] <Dopamien> @CarelessWhimper to me shes a burst character, I block like 80% of the time and try to catch opening. since her mixups are so basic I try to pressure just to see how someone reacts
[4:09:04] <CheyMix> dont have to like it
[4:09:06] <leith_aziz> @CarelessWhimper Stagelag is only on Axl's stage from what I know
[4:09:10] <+s0lesurviv0r> @leith_aziz I remember her theme having alot more "bubblegum synth"
[4:09:32] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz nah, leos as well, mays as well, like a good handful of em are noticeably more laggy than others
[4:09:47] <zenith0111> @leith_aziz Any stage with NPC and a lot of 3D models. So Mays Ship and the forest area
[4:09:50] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[4:09:51] <VJdarkworld> :O
[4:10:18] <Uselesswhitenoise> Man, strives been out for weeks now, and yet we still don't have something very important from woolie. A character theme song Tier List.
[4:10:22] <zenith0111> the forest stage has relfections of the ground you can hardly see so thats also one reason stages lag
[4:10:23] <leith_aziz> @CheyMix Well, Im not as pissed as others, but I get why they get mad at Arcsys for that. But there's no denying that Arcsys being passionate about doing stiff their way is what makes their games so unique. In both gameplay, music, designand lore
[4:10:24] <CarelessWhimper> @Dopamien Life of a Laura ^^' I wish you all the best tho, she's good, just can't play as actively as a lot of the cast, same as i-no
[4:10:24] <cocobody> I haven't been watching much Strive stuff. What wacky combo was that CHipp doing that walked him up the wall?
[4:10:27] <+steelmorrigan> 5 raiders from steelmorrigan have joined! 
[4:10:34] <+R0kushi> I find it curious that faust stage is not laggy, pretty happy about it though because I love that stage
[4:10:43] <DomPressesButtons> raiders!!!
[4:10:44] <NawsCire> pog raid
[4:10:45] <Applecannon63> Strive gotta have that Model figure mode soon

[4:10:57] <CheyMix> gotta stop the rat
[4:11:02] <cocobody> Hello raiders
[4:11:07] <+steelmorrigan> thought i'd come take in some Strive
[4:11:12] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 I dont know when it'll come out, but ity is planned
[4:11:18] <leith_aziz> *it is
[4:11:31] <+fetrigon> chipp is wild
[4:11:32] <CarelessWhimper> @R0kushi i think its slightly more likely to be laggy than council and 12th dimension, but it's way less bad than the worst offenders :D
[4:11:42] <+jepupu> Throw chipp on wakeup
[4:11:46] <zenith0111> @r0kushi Its one of the if not THE laggiest
[4:11:49] <ElPlasa> "My bones are made of glass!"
[4:11:50] <CarelessWhimper> @fetrigon he has to be with how brittle his bones are
[4:12:00] <cocobody> Damn, that damage
[4:12:07] <+fetrigon> LUL
[4:12:23] <zenith0111> Dustloop has a list of laggy stages and good stages
[4:12:25] <Dopamien> @CarelessWhimper mostly waiting for Jam lmao. Its nice to just concentrate on footsies and habits my opponents make. I think less of my moves and more what opponents do. I still like her setup
[4:12:31] <+R0kushi> @zenith0111 I tested all stages with a friend with a not very good computer, may and forest were really bad but faust was prettu alright, but I could be wrong
[4:12:42] <+jepupu> Dropped
[4:12:52] <+SpleenGoblin> hello friends
[4:12:55] <yukichocomilk> SUKI SUKIYAKI
[4:12:57] <+fetrigon> dropped :(
[4:12:59] <black_mages_matter_> i can never react to his alpha blade and command grab, they look identical to me

[4:13:16] <CheyMix> @black_mages_matter_ its hard for sure. def a learning curve
[4:13:39] <ElPlasa> @black_mages_matter_ you've gotta watch out for the leaves, but yeah, he goes so fast it's really hard
[4:13:50] <+fetrigon> oh shit this dude is streaming
[4:13:53] <meatman_noplan> oh!
[4:13:58] <+fetrigon> as well
[4:14:01] <+Canti510> what a super
[4:14:03] <+jepupu> You can pretty much 2H on Nago when you expect Chipp to jump. Most of the time he'll jump right in
[4:14:05] <%Exiliator> nice
[4:14:16] <CarelessWhimper> Ain't know anything about Jam, other than hearing her described as being sorta like Juri, which has me hype
[4:14:36] <Ziegsy> what kind of ninja name is chipp?
[4:14:48] <ElPlasa> NICCEEEEEEEEEE
[4:14:52] <CarelessWhimper> @Ziegsy An american one
[4:14:55] <VJdarkworld> :O
[4:15:02] <cocobody> Ooh Nago got gams
[4:15:05] <zenith0111> Do a low before Dust!
[4:15:17] <black_mages_matter_> @Ziegsy he was born in america
[4:15:18] <zenith0111> Oh nevermind he got it lol
[4:15:29] <Ziegsy> @CarelessWhimper understandable ty
[4:15:51] <+Canti510> Oh
[4:15:51] <marcomatame> damn this Chipp angy
[4:15:54] <ElPlasa> oh damn
[4:15:54] <+fetrigon> YOOOOOOOO
[4:15:56] <%MutedMimic> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[4:15:56] <meatman_noplan> Yo that's cool
[4:15:57] <CarelessWhimper> that was not worth
[4:16:01] <CarelessWhimper> but i guess he got the grab XD
[4:16:08] <+Canti510> this chipp wasn't having your shit Woolie
[4:16:08] <+fetrigon> @carelesswhimper also true
[4:16:10] <+jepupu> No wallbreak that way though
[4:16:10] <CheyMix> shit damage tho lol
[4:16:22] <+Canti510> it was worth, no victory without style
[4:16:28] <meatman_noplan> Style trumps damage, its cool
[4:16:30] <+R0kushi> imma have to lab those anti chipp things hotashi has been doing prettu hard
[4:16:30] <CarelessWhimper> more meter, less damage, for sure i'd take the reset off wb
[4:16:38] <+jepupu> If you can do a read, 2H instead of 6P against chipp
[4:16:46] <NotHereToStream> chipps gonna crackfiend on you allday
[4:16:48] <CarelessWhimper> @meatman_noplan oh 100%
[4:17:00] <zenith0111> Chipps stupid in Strive and takes no skill
[4:17:14] <+jepupu> Someone's salty
[4:17:16] <ElPlasa> @zenith0111 Hard disagree
[4:17:21] <CarelessWhimper> Absolute salt
[4:17:24] <CarelessWhimper> But yeah
[4:17:27] <marcomatame> @zenith0111 scrubquotes
[4:17:47] <zenith0111> You guys must have never tried chipp hes a mini gorilla
[4:17:48] <+DJSummers101> @zenith0111 I extremely disagree since I play Potemkin.
[4:17:58] <A1_Mistake_Sauce> you can jab the command grab.
[4:18:08] <marcomatame> s o c i e t y
[4:18:10] <CarelessWhimper> Pot Chipp is volatile tho, its real rough... Till you breathe on him

[4:18:21] <Qu1ckyyy> damn this theme is super fire
[4:18:25] <+R0kushi> my soul leaves my body fighting axl, chipp you know, it can be an annoying mosquito
[4:18:26] <leith_aziz> This is gonna be a weird question, but I'd like to ask nontheless.
[4:18:30] <CarelessWhimper> He'll style on you for 20 seconds, then you hit him twice and he dies
[4:18:33] <cocobody> Such a weird combo
[4:18:40] <+R0kushi> but its not as rough as being zonned out
[4:18:42] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz octoNa octoNi
[4:18:48] <+Canti510> the recovery, fuck lol
[4:18:50] <VJdarkworld> monkaS
[4:19:08] <leith_aziz> We like to joke about GG lore, but as a guy who genuinly likes it, I find it pretty easy to find people who also like it, and others who think its trash. I get why'd they think that, but my question is how do I deal with that fact better? It kinda weighs on my mind when it shouldnt
[4:19:22] <zenith0111> I play chipp when I dont want to think
[4:19:24] <ThatButler> Fear the character with a fullscreen whiff punish super.
[4:19:26] <cocobody> @R0kushi Agreed being zoned out hurts my soul

[4:19:49] <leith_aziz> *song
[4:20:04] <zenith0111> I remember bodying this chipp main with chipp in celestial because he refused to acknowledge how cheap he was so I took it into my own hands LUL
[4:20:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:20:13] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz To be fair, I can admit it's convoluted, so I dont wanna be blind to that fact
[4:20:59] <+MTLxSpider> would u like to spare with me sir @WoolieVersus
[4:21:01] <cocobody> jab L O C K D O W N
[4:21:12] <leith_aziz> Overture is generally seen as the black sheep of GG, but damn does it have banger music
[4:21:15] <zenith0111> "Chipp has low health so its fine" Meanwhile a basic strive combo from anyone alrwady does 80%
[4:21:22] <cgeonetta> is he playing PC or console?
[4:21:23] <+R0kushi> @leith_aziz I mean I love it too, and thats enough, if you like it you dont need others approval, enjoy what you enjoy
[4:21:27] <+fetrigon> @leith_aziz people that don't like what you like exist. Even if you think they're missing out, they've decided for themselves that they're not missing out on anything.
[4:21:33] <leith_aziz> Chipp's basic combos do NOT do a lot of dammage
[4:21:42] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz I mean, it's the same as liking anything on the internet, i think. If you know why you like it and people disagree with that in ways that don't persuade you, disregard them
[4:21:44] <+jepupu> @zenith0111 we get it you hate him
[4:22:01] <+s0lesurviv0r> SingsNote enbMusic SingsNote enbMusic

[4:23:03] <+jepupu> I wish Strive had some of the Korean GGXX soundtrack in there
[4:23:29] <CarelessWhimper> EVERY TIME

[4:23:30] <+MTLxSpider> was wondering why people keep @ zeniith only to remember i ahve them blocked. LUL

[4:24:00] <yukichocomilk> reversal super is so hard to do in this game, is suck at it
[4:24:01] <+R0kushi> leaves*
[4:24:11] <leith_aziz> Anyway, I appreciate the advice, chat. You didnt need to answer but I glad you did. Helps to gain some insight
[4:24:12] <Dopamien> for axls command grab how do you deal with it? Just jump?
[4:24:15] <zenith0111> I dk why people cant reversal super.
[4:24:17] <leith_aziz> @Dopamien Jump
[4:24:24] <%JaseAdrift> Just jump
[4:24:25] <zenith0111> I do that shit so consistently
[4:24:28] <CarelessWhimper> @Picia000123 Oh for sure, wakeup super is real
[4:24:28] <yukichocomilk> @zenith0111 cause it's like 3f window
[4:24:31] <leith_aziz> @zenith0111 3 frames of liniency. are you kidding?
[4:24:32] <Dopamien> @leith_aziz well ok then lmao
[4:24:38] <+fetrigon> @leith_aziz <3
[4:24:54] <leith_aziz> @fetrigon SeemsGood
[4:25:00] <+R0kushi> axl's reversal super is easier thouhg, its the double hadouken input isnt it?
[4:25:03] <+R0kushi> like rams
[4:25:12] <zenith0111> Sure 3f window but by that time all you need to do is hit one button
[4:25:15] <leith_aziz> @R0kushi Those types of super are easier
[4:25:24] <yukichocomilk> yeah but it's so hard to time anyway
[4:25:33] <leith_aziz> Is this guy trolling or what?
[4:25:35] <CarelessWhimper> @Dopamien jump, backdash, depends on situation too. If you see him throw it out as you wake up at a timing that feels off to you, brc into beating his ass can work
[4:25:36] <%JaseAdrift> The hard part about it is timing it properly
[4:25:44] <black_mages_matter_> i think this axl just has him downloaded right now
[4:25:50] <CarelessWhimper> ^
[4:25:52] <NotHereToStream> the only way for axl to win is to timestop and then taunt, thats how you win the round even if you lose
[4:25:55] <zenith0111> Idk I just llok at the animations for my timing
[4:26:01] <%Irridium> ay yo gg's
[4:26:03] <cocobody> He really assaulted the toes that last round
[4:26:05] <leith_aziz> @zenith0111 I guess
[4:26:06] <black_mages_matter_> that air grab was pretty awesome
[4:26:23] <zenith0111> @leith_aziz Then what do you use for timing?
[4:26:24] <CarelessWhimper> It's not trolling when you make it obvious you know the opponent isn't going to block/dodge the same move over and over
[4:26:31] <leith_aziz> Well, it's getting pretty late on my end. Thanks for the stream, Woolie. Peace
[4:26:33] <zenith0111> Just count?
[4:26:43] <leith_aziz> This was a lot of fun to watch
[4:27:05] <DianaTheAscian> whoa
[4:27:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[4:27:13] <+fetrigon> o/ bye
[4:27:21] <+jepupu> Fighting Axl is weird in a way that even those that don't usually have to rushdown damn well better try to against him
[4:27:21] <%JaseAdrift> LUL
[4:27:22] <black_mages_matter_> lmfao
[4:27:25] <CarelessWhimper> @leith_aziz cheers
[4:27:26] <%JaseAdrift> right back at ya
[4:27:27] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[4:27:31] <+Canti510> you pressed one too lol
[4:27:37] <zenith0111> AGANE
[4:27:46] <+R0kushi> at this moment I just get sad lmao
[4:27:48] <DianaTheAscian> Axl's love that move
[4:27:55] <+R0kushi> tatsunDed
[4:27:56] <ElPlasa> Question, can you beyblade axl's command grab? considering it puts you in the air
[4:28:08] <zenith0111> The second part of the super is safe so its kind of hard to convince and Axl not to ever do it without baiting it
[4:28:14] <CarelessWhimper> I gotta hit up Ninja Gentleman again sometime soon, i need more axl training
[4:28:14] <+jepupu> So many j.Ss
[4:28:16] <ElPlasa> I don't know if the forward momentum would throw you back into it
[4:28:19] <DianaTheAscian> I don't think you can
[4:28:25] <%dreadedcthulhu> this matchup seems so hard
[4:28:31] <zenith0111> If you block the first part you can jump punish the rest of it
[4:28:40] <+R0kushi> I tried punishing sometime the reversal, but was dumb to FD so I was negative on the jump
[4:28:43] <+R0kushi> and got hit
[4:28:50] <DianaTheAscian> it's a very rough matchup
[4:28:50] <+R0kushi> tatsunDed
[4:29:11] <%dreadedcthulhu> 6h sajamGasm
[4:29:16] <+Chosington> Playing versus an axl as faust is true suffering FeelsBadMan
[4:29:17] <LukeZeFoo_ruku> majinoElmo
[4:29:39] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington Literally no offense meant; Does Faust have any good-feeling MUs?
[4:29:40] <zenith0111> Whats shitty to is the ArcSys said "We took out the Block stun increase on FD" those filthy liars.... @r0kushi
[4:29:43] <verscoll> Love the animation in that
[4:29:44] <%JaseAdrift> he's just mashing it out
[4:29:59] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Have money, internet man.
[4:30:02] <+Chosington> @CarelessWhimper Yeah, the mirror match Kappa
[4:30:02] <CheyMix> send out a clone?
[4:30:19] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington wxlfgaLMAO
[4:30:27] <%JaseAdrift> oh boy he keeps using 6hs and getting punished for it
[4:30:28] <DianaTheAscian> yup
[4:30:30] <+Ben_VC> OL RELIABLE
[4:30:35] <zenith0111> Clone beats Axls rensen but he only does that fullscreen @cheymix
[4:30:37] <DianaTheAscian> Everytime
[4:30:38] <black_mages_matter_> LUL
[4:30:45] <zenith0111> JUST BAIT IT ONCE
[4:30:56] <black_mages_matter_> good old reversal super. nothing beats it.
[4:31:07] <%FallenAngelZelos> I love how Woolie is doing his favorite thing in the world but still looks like he is about to murder someone in cold blood
[4:31:17] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[4:31:27] <ElPlasa> hey, it worked
[4:31:30] <+fetrigon> I'm like that too tho LUL
[4:31:32] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington Like, he doesn't do well against fast characters, doesn't do good against meaty pressure characters, i don't even think he'd feel safe doing stuff v Pot in general
[4:31:34] <Picia000123> Gigabotch
[4:31:36] <+FuqBoiSlim> that's his game face
[4:31:43] <Picia000123> omegafumble
[4:31:46] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington full respect to fausts, seems stressful
[4:32:04] <+FuqBoiSlim> omnichoke
[4:32:11] <zenith0111> When Axl does that flipback fade away attack you can react to it and jump punish him for it
[4:32:15] <cocobody> reversal super
[4:32:18] <+Chosington> @CarelessWhimper Faust can kinda keep a pot away but once Pot is even close DANGER TIME appears in big font
[4:32:24] <zenith0111> Its not a true blockstring
[4:32:35] <DianaTheAscian> yup I was wondering when they'd do that
[4:32:59] <+Blueberryfists> i at least want an infinite rematch button
[4:33:13] <+RemedyofRevenge> sajamVibe sajamVibe sajamVibe
[4:33:20] <cocobody> This Axl's quick on the buttons at start
[4:33:27] <DianaTheAscian> parks are infinite I think
[4:33:34] <black_mages_matter_> LUL
[4:33:37] <%JaseAdrift> LUL
[4:33:41] <TheMagneticDragon> So is disco elysium next week
[4:33:46] <zenith0111> WOOLIE PLEASE
[4:33:48] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington yee, like, i deffo think Faust is the worst in the game, not cus hes terrible, but being offensive is risky and being defensive isn't exactly safe, and if you fuck up once its easy to just lose the round. Oof
[4:33:51] <+RichieRichHomie> Can you RC Nago's super for more damage?
[4:33:52] <DianaTheAscian> nice
[4:33:56] <%SirGO0SE> man the safe jump mission has been stumping me for 2 play sessions now
[4:33:58] <+fetrigon> @themagneticdragon prob idk
[4:34:02] <black_mages_matter_> i think hes gonna reversal super every time hes getting oki'd with 50 meter
[4:34:04] <LukeZeFoo_ruku> majinoElmo majinoElmo majinoElmo
[4:34:07] <DianaTheAscian> very nice
[4:34:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:34:15] <+R0kushi> LETS GOOO
[4:34:22] <+R0kushi> lytJIVE
[4:34:26] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[4:34:34] <JetpackMcQuack> take the slap
[4:34:35] <CarelessWhimper> @WoolieVersus dont forget mays
[4:34:35] <zenith0111> Im always genuinely surprised at the lack of rensen from my fellow Axl players... theres a reason youre losing guys NotLikeThis
[4:34:36] <%baka_sugoi> S O C I A T Y
[4:34:36] <TheMagneticDragon> @fetrigon I understand, sometimes the schedule is confusing but I understand woolie has his own interests in mind as well as the need to vary his content
[4:35:06] <DianaTheAscian> nope
[4:35:14] <Picia000123> too high blood pressure
[4:35:14] <meatman_noplan> Reggie was unavailable today so the plan got changed.
[4:35:17] <+Ben_VC> @zenith0111 they don't rensenGET IT, know what i'm sayin?
[4:35:23] <%dreadedcthulhu> cali burst
[4:35:23] <+Chosington> @CarelessWhimper pretty much but he does have a fair few tricks if you can do em right and once you get the mixmixmix game down its also swell
[4:35:27] <zenith0111> Most play Axl but go "Oh looks like I dont need to learn charge I guess" NotLikeThis
[4:35:43] <zenith0111> @ben_vc stripCool stripClown stripCool
[4:35:44] <Namboto> man I really want to get good at fighting Rams but I'm fighting against the feeling of "is it a gap of skill, or is your character just better than mine?"
[4:36:05] <zenith0111> ANOTHA ONE
[4:36:14] <+FoxLex_> I assume this is PC?
[4:36:20] <Namboto> like I know it's both, but how much of one over the other
[4:36:20] <LukeZeFoo_ruku> @Namboto make a buddy who plays ram. helped me a bunch.
[4:36:20] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[4:36:22] <%JaseAdrift> Yup
[4:36:22] <zenith0111> @namboto Depends who you play?
[4:36:27] <+R0kushi> its more like learning to deal with hear really, but yeah, it takes some time @Namboto
[4:36:35] <+R0kushi> her*
[4:36:36] <black_mages_matter_> @FoxLex_ play station has built in delay or something
[4:36:43] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington oh for sure, just sucks that the downsides are so rough and the updsides aren't good enough it makes him excel over an Axl or Ram or w/e ^^' But again, all respects, out of every character i want to see Faust players flourish
[4:37:16] <Namboto> @lukezefoo I actually have one, but he's not as good as most of the ones I'm seeing in the tower
[4:37:26] <biel_zebu> @Namboto Always assume it's skill, because even if it IS the character, there inst much you can do about it.
[4:37:34] <CarelessWhimper> @Namboto lemme get you a link real quick, check DMs in a sec
[4:37:36] <JetpackMcQuack> look at him go
[4:37:49] <DianaTheAscian> nice comeback
[4:37:50] <zenith0111> The way strive is mad I legitimately cant tell the difference between a ne wplayer and a more experienced one
[4:38:16] <%Irridium> okay maybe I tried to get a little cheeky LLUL
[4:38:19] <zenith0111> Which I think might be good?
[4:38:30] <+Chosington> @CarelessWhimper the worst part about playing Faust is the times im in training mode with random characters and finding out their damage is that much easier woolieMIRIN
[4:38:32] <%Irridium> GG's
[4:38:32] <CheyMix> @Irridium lol
[4:38:38] <LukeZeFoo_ruku> @Namboto understandable. (woolie destroyed my nervous Leo, i could use a nago buddy)
[4:39:01] <CarelessWhimper> @Chosington oh 100%
[4:39:17] <dmtjinni> what happened
[4:39:26] <DianaTheAscian> time for lab
[4:39:30] <+RichieRichHomie> OVer tiiiime
[4:39:38] <%dreadedcthulhu> romollaJam romollaJam romollaJam romollaJam romollaJam
[4:39:43] <zenith0111> 6H is one of Axls worst moves in all of Guilty Gear
[4:39:54] <+pandapeeps> The full moon!
[4:39:57] <ElPlasa> it depends on the meatyness
[4:40:05] <CarelessWhimper> Aight, imma go lab for the majors at the end of the month, cya chat ^^
[4:40:11] <+RichieRichHomie> will ever growwww
[4:40:14] <Uselesswhitenoise> NON-STOP LOVESONG
[4:40:20] <+pandapeeps> SO THAT's me
[4:40:40] <+Cobaltor_252> oh man the Woolie character has Woolie colours
[4:40:40] <+RichieRichHomie> IM A DISASTER OF PASSION
[4:40:43] <zenith0111> You can react to 6H to because the start up is so long
[4:40:45] <Applecannon63> I don't understand the complaints with Ky's Strive design I thought it works because he is no longer holy captian knight cause the war with Gears is over and has become a King and family man that he'd take a casual outfit
[4:40:50] <black_mages_matter_> SWALLOW PogChamp
[4:41:16] <Applecannon63> plus his King outfit in Overture is so goof as fuck
[4:41:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:41:21] <Oak_bogle> @applecannon63 some people don‚Äôt care about story reasons. But I agree. I don‚Äôt get the hate
[4:41:31] <zenith0111> Axls best option after a block 6h is to blockstring into rainwater
[4:41:35] <TheDr0t> hello chat
[4:41:36] <CheyMix> @Applecannon63 most people that are playing this game don't really care about the lore.
[4:41:39] <CheyMix> sadly
[4:41:43] <CheyMix> but its true
[4:41:44] <Oak_bogle> ^
[4:41:53] <ElPlasa> @Oak_bogle Wait, there's people who don't like Ky's new outfit? why
[4:41:55] <biel_zebu> Does Axl get RPS of that?
[4:42:18] <zenith0111> 6H? Just pressure really but only at the right distance
[4:42:23] <CarelessWhimper> Yeah, honestly, i'm coming over from SFV and the Lore does -not- appeal to me as a newcomer
[4:42:26] <%townzzzzz> where's the sol vs. ky theme, that the real question
[4:42:31] <+Chosington> By the way while I'm here Woolie fantastic stuff on those GG Lore vids, used them to catch up with the story and they were excellent
[4:42:38] <CheyMix> @townzzzzz gotta fish for it
[4:42:52] <CheyMix> ive been playing gg for a month and I still haven't gotten the song diva
[4:42:56] <CheyMix> IM MAD
[4:43:03] <%townzzzzz> mean the a new vs theme
[4:43:14] <%townzzzzz> doesn't feel right
[4:43:14] <zenith0111> Rainwater is +3 but the start is slow and jump punishable
[4:43:17] <ElPlasa> @CheyMix I still can't get Dice, I feel ya
[4:43:34] <CheyMix> they arent really rivals anymore @townzzzzz
[4:43:43] <Oak_bogle> @elplasa I can‚Äôt give you a definitive reason for peoples opinions. But personally I get into characters because of who they are so for me I love it.
[4:43:46] <CheyMix> dont think they have a reason for a new one
[4:43:51] <%townzzzzz> in-laws rivals
[4:43:54] <%FallenAngelZelos> I‚Äôm still fishing for storyteller :(
[4:44:06] <Applecannon63> Sol and Ky are weird Inlaws
[4:44:17] <CarelessWhimper> I'm fishing for more cute clothes PrideUwu
[4:44:23] <cgeonetta> you get a jump punish after blocking the first hit
[4:44:33] <Applecannon63> its doesn't help the Valentines make the family awkward
[4:44:40] <Bonebagmel> Labbin night?
[4:44:52] <stormhawk9891> Speaking of music, I just caught myself a nice Birthday Train, so that's great
[4:44:58] <zenith0111> You can block the first part safely and still jump
[4:45:04] <Applecannon63> with Ramlethal and Eplet technically Sol's siblings
[4:45:16] <black_mages_matter_> @Bonebagmel he just fought an axl and is figuring out how to punish the things he was having difficulty with
[4:45:33] <Bonebagmel> @Bonebagmel nice, thx!
[4:45:59] <Bonebagmel> @WoolieVersus is there a metered answer? air RC drift in?
[4:46:17] <Bonebagmel> true true
[4:46:37] <Bonebagmel> That's nice
[4:46:48] <Bonebagmel> super jump too high?
[4:46:53] <zenith0111> For sure
[4:47:15] <Bonebagmel> seems you can land before he recovers from the 2nd hit
[4:47:17] <+OrangeMDT> You can‚Äôt super jump?
[4:47:29] <Bonebagmel> there it is
[4:47:34] <zenith0111> I think if he whiffs the first hit you can just go for a BnB on the ground
[4:47:58] <Bonebagmel> blocking also works, good to know
[4:48:10] <DianaTheAscian> have you ever tried using a hit box controller?
[4:48:13] <CheyMix> damn the sweep part of the super doesn't have a lingering hitbox
[4:48:14] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus great work on the lore series, I feel people sleep on FG lore too bit much. Btw any plans in the future to play the new ultrakill update?
[4:48:16] <CheyMix> intresting
[4:48:36] <+koalaf1ed> Have you seen the "6 brain cell" nago blood management meme on r/guiltygear. actually useful for noobs like me
[4:48:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:48:43] <DrkJP520> how's the weather in canada?
[4:48:47] <Bonebagmel> This game triggered carpal tunnel on buttons for me (right hand) because I play on keyboard. Any advice on placement and posture?
[4:49:23] <%Exiliator> I like your funny fighting-game-words internet man
[4:49:25] <VJdarkworld> @bonebagmel prob best to pickup hitbox
[4:49:26] <+RenoDeGeneric> Make sure your wrists aren't horizontal
[4:49:30] <CarelessWhimper> @Bonebagmel seek out better resources than me, but putting your keyboard on your lap might help?
[4:49:40] <Bonebagmel> Sadly I can't buy a hitbox in argentina.

[4:49:41] <meatman_noplan> I've been playing keyboard too because I can't for the life of me do inputs on a pad.
[4:49:45] <%FallenAngelZelos> I can‚Äôt use a keyboard anymore for gaming :(
[4:49:45] <+koalaf1ed> hotbox +1
[4:49:46] <DrkJP520> Have you considered a gamer cube?
[4:49:59] <Applecannon63> If only Ky had DI meter
[4:49:59] <+koalaf1ed> hiybox*
[4:50:03] <+Mrbaconator> hitbox finally fucking ships to me next week after waiting for months
[4:50:05] <zenith0111> Keyboard buttons are just too close together for extended play
[4:50:14] <VJdarkworld> ive been playing on keyboard but shit be cramped, i got an insta upgrade with hitbox
[4:50:21] <Applecannon63> or better yet Ky take on an Order Sol playstyle
[4:50:24] <+koalaf1ed> takes getting used too but I'm never going back
[4:50:27] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can make a hitbox with some buttons, a PCB, and a pizzabox
[4:50:35] <Bonebagmel> Flat angles, gotcha. Thanks everyone
[4:51:05] <%FallenAngelZelos> It sucks that it takes FOREVER once you even screw up your wrist even a bit
[4:51:10] <+koalaf1ed> build quality is fantastic on a hitbox
[4:51:14] <meatman_noplan> Way way back in the days of SF4AE I was a keyboard El Fuerte player. It worked out surprisingly well.
[4:51:18] <zenith0111> I know some people get hand crippled for life because of bad posture while playing
[4:51:19] <%Dakuu75> I just saw a tweet saying Dead Space 1 is getting a remake. this fake news?
[4:51:20] <DianaTheAscian> i like Nago mirrors
[4:51:23] <+koalaf1ed> lmao
[4:51:33] <CheyMix> MORE DIVA!
[4:51:35] <verscoll> @Dakuu75 it's real
[4:51:56] <Applecannon63> Mirrors are an Ego Killer
[4:52:01] <zenith0111> But Im the better Axl not him BibleThump
[4:52:01] <Bonebagmel> @RenoDeGeneric I saw that nihongo gaming vid, I'm considering buying a cheap arcade stick kit button and stick to see if I can make myself something
[4:52:03] <+ChrisAlgoo> perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything
[4:52:04] <ThatButler> Mirrors are the best, you get big reveals from them
[4:52:05] <Applecannon63> and oh god Valentines theme
[4:52:11] <+MillionStabz> WOOLIE
[4:52:14] <%Dakuu75> daaaaamn. I feel like the first 1 still holds up but, its getting a remake. cool.
[4:52:19] <DianaTheAscian> the drops
[4:52:19] <ElPlasa> THE CANADIAN RESETS
[4:52:31] <ElPlasa> LUL
[4:52:34] <+koalaf1ed> need a monster for every millia mirror
[4:52:37] <%Wydamn> oh no
[4:52:45] <VJdarkworld> @bonebagmel i guess too like, if its a throwaway keyboard, you can gut all the keys and switches so its just a hitbox layout too
[4:52:46] <ThatButler> Sajam using the fast RC cancel from command grab to aerial combo blew my mind the first time he used it.
[4:52:51] <+RenoDeGeneric> @RenoDeGeneric It's a fun little project, and you end up with something a lot more personal than a mass produces stick lol.
[4:53:01] <%Irridium> Axl mirrors are so fuckin stupid man LUL
[4:53:03] <+ChrisAlgoo> that was an emotional rollercoaster
[4:53:24] <zenith0111> @irridium The only mirror where literally no advantage can be held
[4:53:34] <CheyMix> hope they patch the og music to be louder in the future
[4:53:39] <zenith0111> "Oh cool im fullscreen now I can.... oh yeah"
[4:53:41] <CheyMix> songs waaay too low
[4:53:42] <+ChrisAlgoo> P TOWN LETS GO
[4:54:05] <+koalaf1ed> it's the sam sho woolie always wanted
[4:54:07] <%FallenAngelZelos> @irridium oh did I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm even imagine
[4:54:08] <+OrangeMDT> Woolie bulli
[4:54:15] <+MillionStabz> Nago diff
[4:54:34] <Who_lio42> holy hell that rematch is fast
[4:54:55] <DrkJP520> Where does his mask disappear to after a match?
[4:55:11] <zenith0111> Into is dreads
[4:55:19] <%dreadedcthulhu> nanomachines son
[4:55:26] <%Irridium> @zenith0111 just two full rounds of pokes and jabs. and each trying and failing to lariat the other
[4:55:28] <Applecannon63> the mask hide beneath his dreads like a tie
[4:55:50] <verscoll> I just noticed that the bear in the background isn't a decoration...
[4:55:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[4:55:52] <Serge_12> Yo is that color a Mod!?
[4:55:53] <zenith0111> @irridium Tbh when I see im about to get an Axl I mirror I go Potemkin
[4:56:06] <zenith0111> I hate the mirror that much
[4:56:07] <Applecannon63> Bear could be a gear
[4:56:24] <CheyMix> @Serge_12 the one he had? no
[4:56:44] <Serge_12> @cheymix But the one he just selected is?
[4:56:46] <%dreadedcthulhu> millia mix is rough
[4:56:47] <Applecannon63> cause Gears are technically are animals injected with gear cells
[4:56:59] <meatman_noplan> the instant millia overhead is tough
[4:57:08] <CheyMix> @Serge_12 is a mod
[4:57:16] <Serge_12> Thats awesome!
[4:57:18] <%kennneh> kennneh subscribed with Prime. 
[4:57:38] <%FallenAngelZelos> It‚Äôs a shame that Woolie has no experience fighting milia‚Ä¶..
[4:57:41] <zenith0111> @meatman_noplan Its one of the easiest moves to TK
[4:57:47] <CheyMix> the SYNC
[4:57:48] <VJdarkworld> @applecannon63 kuma dragon install monkaS
[4:57:50] <cocobody> Such a cool wall break combo
[4:57:53] <meatman_noplan> dru
[4:57:54] <CheyMix> love this game man lol
[4:58:07] <Applecannon63> @fallenangelzelos you mean Reggie

[4:58:26] <%Deft_Thought> Based Burt & Ernie
[4:58:32] <+ChrisAlgoo> group chat has changed its name to burt baist
[4:58:51] <meatman_noplan> Hey you got those bursts baited? Burts baist? What?
[5:00:07] <+MK_Ineptitude> we running park lobbies today?
[5:00:10] <zenith0111> Air Throws are your friend here
[5:00:12] <CheyMix> hard to focus on draw with all this hype shit
[5:00:25] <+ChrisAlgoo> just noticed your woolie colors mod with the reboot icon that's really nice
[5:00:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Do we have killers tonight?
[5:00:38] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Are they out?
[5:01:31] <%RyTYoung> Hey
[5:01:32] <%Deft_Thought> There's been a couple
[5:01:42] <%RyTYoung> Hey all and Woolie! *
[5:01:49] <%Deft_Thought> Sup
[5:01:59] <%Juriasu> yeah mirazh is pretty good vs nago on round start
[5:02:01] <+GenuineChillCast> >This sucks >Immediately bodies her
[5:02:03] <+IronBagel1> hello
[5:02:09] <%dreadedcthulhu> super duper low profile actually
[5:02:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Tatakae Woolie
[5:02:10] <+IronBagel1> nagoriyuki gaming
[5:02:44] <%RyTYoung> I think I'm either gonna pick up Millia or Nago next, Millia looks like she can do some dumb air combo stuff
[5:03:20] <zenith0111> Millia and Chipp basically hording all the air combos
[5:03:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:03:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Just pick a top tier-Sanford
[5:03:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pick Sagat
[5:03:49] <%RyTYoung> And here I am playing Ky who can't air combo for shit
[5:03:55] <%dreadedcthulhu> gio can have a little bit of j.k>j.d>66>j.d as a treat
[5:04:01] <zenith0111> Also Sanford: Picks Gill
[5:04:34] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Sweating
[5:04:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Throws stick on the fround
[5:05:18] <%RyTYoung> Nice dust air
[5:05:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Almost woolie
[5:06:03] <%RyTYoung> Millia kicks my ass every time
[5:06:15] <g0d_zill4> i find that throwing a F.S as Nago against Millia's just doesn't work since they almost always just jump and FS whiffs completely
[5:06:20] <zenith0111> I played to much xrd for millia to open me up
[5:06:44] <+jaayro> i imagine a world where nago f.s catches jumps on the way up
[5:06:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Atleast its not Potemkin Kappq
[5:06:46] <%RyTYoung> Ohh snap Woolie played Superliminal earlier?
[5:06:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Kappa
[5:08:02] <Serge_12> You got this!
[5:08:08] <%RyTYoung> OOOOO
[5:08:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gambatte woolie
[5:08:51] <JekkusTV> sick
[5:08:53] <%RyTYoung> yeyeye
[5:08:59] <%Deft_Thought> 5P Baybee
[5:10:03] <%RyTYoung> omg
[5:10:10] <%Deft_Thought> Damn
[5:10:19] <Chorkly> you hate to see it
[5:10:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> If you dont think they cant get a read out of you
[5:10:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:10:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Just play dumb Kappa
[5:11:28] <%RyTYoung> unleash the unga bunga within you doodRage
[5:11:32] <zenith0111> Your 0 on block after that spin move
[5:12:22] <NotHereToStream> millia might be able to challenge him with a fast normal?
[5:12:29] <NotHereToStream> what is her fastest normal
[5:13:11] <%RyTYoung> holy moly
[5:13:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Send you back
[5:13:18] <PMda2nd> woo
[5:13:19] <VJdarkworld> monkaS
[5:13:20] <Chorkly> this millia kinda clean though
[5:13:40] <biel_zebu> 6 actually
[5:13:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Is this the celestial floor
[5:13:54] <Chorkly> oh woolz made it to heaven?
[5:13:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> looks clean
[5:14:21] <zenith0111> My bad
[5:14:21] <%RyTYoung> is this frame data talk @woolieversus ?
[5:14:36] <Kitsunerasu> does dustloop have data on strive moves?
[5:14:43] <Chorkly> it does
[5:14:47] <Kitsunerasu> gucci
[5:14:53] <biel_zebu> @Kitsunerasu Yes
[5:14:58] <+RenoDeGeneric> I find it real hard to believe she has nothing faster than 6, that's wild.
[5:14:59] <Chorkly> data and hitboxes of pretty reliable quality
[5:15:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Make her hold this "L"
[5:15:06] <%RyTYoung> Need to learn more about frame data
[5:15:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Best girl
[5:15:15] <zenith0111> @renodegeneric I think maybe her jump moves are faster
[5:15:46] <Moldy_Giraffe> Has Woolie expressed any excitement for Gold Dick?
[5:16:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Reminder to not talk to Baiken players do not look at Baiken players and do not shake their hands
[5:16:40] <Chorkly> I didn't realise anyone played baiken, I just thought they wanted to look at her new model.
[5:16:44] <%RyTYoung> niceu niceu
[5:17:54] <+aishman> Is this the PC version?
[5:17:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:17:55] <NotHereToStream> people want baiken, but they won't main her
[5:18:09] <%Deft_Thought> @aishman Yup
[5:18:27] <%kennneh> @NotHereToStream They might main a piss easy version of her.
[5:18:39] <zenith0111> See what happens with Baiken is that people want to play her but then go "Gross Half Circle motions" and drop her
[5:18:41] <Chorkly> Oh you mean +R Baiken?
[5:18:42] <NotHereToStream> @kennneh yeah good point
[5:18:52] <%RyTYoung> Do you guys think they'll update Strive with new supers like what SF V did?
[5:18:56] <%Deft_Thought> The range she hitconfirms into wall combos from is wild
[5:18:59] <+Dreday543> Woolie Is actually in GG: Strive!
[5:19:00] <+aishman> Also YA'LL READDY FOR GOLDDICK- I MEAN GOLDLEWIS?!
[5:19:14] <+aishman> I may trade Pot for him cause BOY does he look like a big dude.

[5:19:44] <OhGeeWhy> pot is eternal
[5:19:58] <+aishman> Listen, I love Pot. But I can't take the nerfed Heat Knuckle
[5:20:08] <+aishman> I CALLED THE JUMP, I SAW IT. WHY CAN IT BE BLOCKED
[5:20:13] <zenith0111> Itd be broken if it was a grab
[5:20:31] <biel_zebu> It does lead to a mixup tho
[5:20:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Pot players get what they deserve Kappa
[5:20:46] <zenith0111> Heat Knuckle wallbreaks so if it was a grab hed be top 3 easily
[5:20:49] <+aishman> Praise and adoration?
[5:20:51] <%TheGreatSunbro> TheGreatSunbro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! THOSE WHO DREAM OF HEAVEN
[5:21:02] <OhGeeWhy> strive players complain about pot, yet STRIVE's form wasn't his scariest
[5:21:09] <Chorkly> brah heat knuckle would not make pot top 3 cmon now
[5:21:19] <+aishman> It WAS a grab in beta and I loved doing it against Faust or people who jump a lot
[5:21:23] <NotHereToStream> the only pot you need to fear is a FAB pot
[5:21:23] <+Dirty_Dandere> the speed of her slash
[5:21:35] <+aishman> It's a slow ass grab, it's only good now during the 2H combo
[5:21:36] <BackwardCap> Stop respecting my wakeup gildedNut
[5:21:36] <triangularblasphemy> Look at him skate away!
[5:21:40] <zenith0111> Potemkin already has one of the best moves in the game so HK being good too is OD
[5:21:46] <triangularblasphemy> Just sliiiiiiding out of the match
[5:21:50] <zenith0111> Garuda and a AA grab? no thanks
[5:22:21] <+xerotwo> S H I N G !
[5:22:30] <+Dreday543> I know it probably wont work in your bracket, but Far 5S,5S into Succ is a good setup
[5:22:39] <biel_zebu> Got em
[5:22:50] <NotHereToStream> got to practice your wallbreak oki
[5:23:25] <biel_zebu> NICE
[5:23:26] <Chorkly> I was totally expecting a burst bait
[5:23:28] <+Dreday543> could she Burst that?
[5:23:29] <+xerotwo> Oh shit
[5:23:32] <j3sharp> GOODSHIT
[5:23:37] <+xerotwo> She could have burst that
[5:23:42] <+Dreday543> i thougth so
[5:23:52] <%FallenAngelZelos> Those RC grabs are hot
[5:23:56] <NotHereToStream> no one can block the overhead. anyone who told you they blocked an overhead is a liar
[5:24:00] <+aishman> OH THEY MAD
[5:24:00] <Chorkly> woolie also could have just delayed his button to bait it, so ram was kinda in a bad spot.
[5:24:18] <ladylunarphoenix> !! Hey is that person from like half an hour ago looking for advice about how to look after their wrists still here?
[5:24:32] <%RyTYoung> Ram be mad
[5:24:40] <+xerotwo> M A D R A M
[5:25:07] <%RyTYoung> she does it for the floofers
[5:25:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[5:25:10] <triangularblasphemy> Deploy the dog
[5:25:11] <+OrangeMDT> Yeah, they‚Äôre in a long blockstun/grab immunity after blocking a Nago 2H
[5:25:18] <%zeroarturia> Mad rammy
[5:26:01] <Chorkly> oh lawd she churnin
[5:26:18] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i hate that super so goddamn much
[5:26:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> WHAT IS SHE EVEN DOING IN THAT SUPER???
[5:26:29] <DianaTheAscian> its tupid good
[5:26:37] <DianaTheAscian> stupid*
[5:26:38] <biel_zebu> It has like no animation
[5:26:54] <DianaTheAscian> she just makes her swords explode
[5:27:08] <CheyMix> ram and her pressure dood lol
[5:27:15] <%FallenAngelZelos> @dianatheascian thank you I never even noticed
[5:27:20] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> Painlethal
[5:27:24] <+Kazekyou> gorilla ram
[5:27:28] <BackwardCap> ggs @woolieversus sajamSol
[5:27:28] <NotHereToStream> yeah, those sword wallstick explosion is what gets me most
[5:27:38] <Chorkly> just spend all your meter FD-ing bro it's all good you don't need it for offence wheres the issue
[5:27:59] <%RyTYoung> @backwardcap that's a great Sol emote LUL
[5:28:04] <Ziegsy> M A N
[5:28:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Violent woolie
[5:28:27] <%FallenAngelZelos> Backdashes are so busted this game
[5:28:42] <zenith0111> You can air throw backdashes
[5:28:44] <%RyTYoung> down to the wire!
[5:29:21] <Chorkly> did she kara the throw or does Nago just have a fat throwbox
[5:29:36] <NotHereToStream> i haven't heard of a kara throw yet in this game
[5:29:41] <willtheprofessional> Anybody know who Woolie played in the previous Guilty Gear entries? I know he played some Baiken
[5:29:59] <Chorkly> @willtheprofessional ky, sin and baiken mainly AFAIK
[5:30:01] <%mr_sups> Sin Kiske
[5:30:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I only remember him playing Baiken
[5:30:03] <NotHereToStream> I think he played sin before baiken came to rev 2
[5:30:25] <+Dreday543> that was sick
[5:30:28] <triangularblasphemy> Damn!
[5:30:37] <willtheprofessional> nice, much appreciated
[5:30:39] <+Dreday543> Taking notes rn
[5:30:53] <%RyTYoung> big damage
[5:30:56] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder if we'll get Sin in the future
[5:31:03] <%Airtola> please tell me woolie is the nago
[5:31:10] <+Dreday543> that delay tho
[5:31:10] <NotHereToStream> of course he is
[5:31:10] <%RyTYoung> @airtola ye
[5:31:10] <triangularblasphemy> yeah
[5:31:16] <DianaTheAscian> Yes
[5:31:27] <+Dreday543> thats sad
[5:31:29] <%Airtola> thank god lmao
[5:31:30] <Chorkly> that escape was almost good
[5:31:30] <triangularblasphemy> wooooooo
[5:31:31] <NotHereToStream> nago is straight up woolie bait
[5:31:46] <%RyTYoung> yeyeyeye
[5:31:51] <triangularblasphemy> Wow!
[5:32:03] <Mahbonk> bloodyamazing
[5:32:05] <meatman_noplan> looking forward to playing Goldlewis
[5:32:05] <DianaTheAscian> Anyone know if Wooile has a second character or is he just doing Nago?
[5:32:05] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> sheeeesh ok
[5:32:07] <potatoch9p> Nice!
[5:32:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:32:27] <+Dreday543> Im glad woolie opened the flood gates for all these dreadhead characters. I finally have something to cosplay!
[5:32:27] <+fizzguy47> @dianatheascian only nago
[5:32:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> I dont think I've seen woolie play any other character in this game lmao
[5:32:43] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Go unga bunga woolie
[5:32:44] <DianaTheAscian> @fizzguy47 k
[5:32:45] <+OrangeMDT> @dianatheascian I don‚Äôt think Woolie knows there are other characters
[5:32:57] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[5:33:01] <+OrangeMDT> Like they‚Äôre all just enemies
[5:33:06] <%RyTYoung> All we need is a character with dreads in KoF XV and the cycle is complete
[5:33:09] <NotHereToStream> wouldn't be surprised if woolie has a pocket baiken later
[5:33:10] <Chorkly> well nago is the boss character after all
[5:33:19] <+MisterArcanine> I think Woolie was originally gonna fuck with Ky
[5:33:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> Nagoriyuki Gear: Strive
[5:33:46] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i hope he checks ky out, he's hard but fun
[5:34:09] <BackwardCap> sajamDelay
[5:34:18] <Chorkly> I fuck with Ky but that mans buttons need some love.
[5:34:27] <BackwardCap> evoGG
[5:34:38] <DianaTheAscian> A lot people play Ky it seems
[5:34:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Lv827
[5:34:54] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> dude if they make foudre arc an overhead he'd go up by like two tiers lol
[5:34:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Nice
[5:35:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[5:35:08] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[5:35:10] <%RyTYoung> I like playing as Ky, maybe not the smartest move making him my first main, his x specials are such a pitfall for ending your combos
[5:35:17] <%FallenAngelZelos> I‚Äôm super surprised about how many Zatos I run into
[5:35:22] <Chorkly> I honestly don't think buffing foudre would make him better.
[5:35:37] <CheyMix> @Chorkly i do
[5:35:43] <CheyMix> make that shit an overhead
[5:35:47] <Chorkly> plus frames and safe jumps with it are good already. Man either needs a safer fireball and dp or better normals.
[5:35:48] <NotHereToStream> a patient leo? who is this man and why is he not unga bunga'ing
[5:35:59] <DianaTheAscian> Laust needs love as well
[5:36:00] <+Dreday543> Playing Potemkins Xrd music. good taste
[5:36:11] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> @Chorkly yeah my biggest issue is getting in when they're blocking low, it's super hard
[5:36:25] <zenith0111> Ky gets punished for a fireball hitting. thats dumb
[5:36:26] <+MisterArcanine> I think Ky will get like a couple minor buffs in the first balance patch and then be godlike
[5:36:29] <Chorkly> @AlwaysReturningVideotapes throw them my man!
[5:36:47] <Chorkly> I'm only a floor 10 ky but I honestly think he's strong.
[5:36:51] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> wait do throws work when they're crouching
[5:36:58] <Chorkly> It just doesn't help Sol and Gio are his bad matchups.
[5:37:07] <DianaTheAscian> I never see Ky's do his dragon install is it even good?
[5:37:12] <+MisterArcanine> No
[5:37:15] <NotHereToStream> you can't throw tech on crouch
[5:37:17] <Chorkly> @AlwaysReturningVideotapes yeah man! and then mix up lk to sweep and lk to dust gattlings in as well
[5:37:19] <+MisterArcanine> His dragon install is bad lol
[5:37:20] <+fetrigon> oof
[5:37:25] <+fetrigon> big oof
[5:37:29] <+MisterArcanine> Which sucks because I want to use it so bad
[5:37:34] <DianaTheAscian> damn
[5:37:38] <theredfox930000> ky is a very meter reliant character
[5:37:51] <+fetrigon> @misterarcanine just use it to style Kappa
[5:37:55] <%FallenAngelZelos> In a high damage fighting game getting a tiny percent more seems pretty pointless
[5:38:03] <Chorkly> I wish Sol would take dragon install back
[5:38:04] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> @Chorkly oh shit i'm gonna write this stuff down lol, thx for the tips
[5:38:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> NICE
[5:38:25] <3Xgilly> i love that bombo
[5:38:26] <DianaTheAscian> yup
[5:38:33] <DianaTheAscian> thats a leo
[5:38:47] <%RyTYoung> @dianatheascian not really, vapor thrust gets multi hits with the heavy version and not much else
[5:38:54] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Get it Woolieee!!!!
[5:39:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> What
[5:39:02] <DianaTheAscian> k
[5:39:03] <+fizzguy47> @fallenangelzelos @fallenangelzelos I disagree, every percent makes a difference the higher the dmg
[5:39:13] <+fizzguy47> lol double mention
[5:39:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:39:16] <%RyTYoung> I have won a match in dragon install so I did get the trophy doodLUL
[5:39:20] <SkinnyRite> fuck that overhead dood
[5:39:21] <Chorkly> @AlwaysReturningVideotapes NP. I'm not amazing but Ky's fundamentals are very easy to get to grips with.
[5:39:22] <theredfox930000> I'm picking up golden Lewis when he drops
[5:39:41] <okuriskyles> what floor is woolie in?
[5:39:50] <NotHereToStream> celestial
[5:39:53] <DianaTheAscian> Heaven
[5:39:54] <okuriskyles> oooooohhh
[5:40:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Over Heaven
[5:40:10] <+MisterArcanine> I need to watch more pro Leo‚Äôs and steal their tech
[5:40:26] <%RyTYoung> I have the weekend off, I'm gonna do my best to get into celestial
[5:40:47] <okuriskyles> i'm on floor 4, i have a long while to go ._.
[5:41:01] <ZeroCount> @MisterArcanine Coachsteve and sonic fox are doing amazing things with him.
[5:41:02] <NotHereToStream> damn nice reaction to the command grab
[5:41:13] <+shogun_133> Thoughts on Goldlewis?
[5:41:15] <%FallenAngelZelos> I hope they separate rankings per character in a future patch. It is really deterring me from trying out new characters
[5:41:17] <SkinnyRite> hey just be glad he's not using that back stance shit on you lol
[5:41:24] <%RyTYoung> @okuriskyles I'm on 7 right now, I was stuck on 5-6 for so long
[5:41:33] <%Lion_kun> Has Woolie made nago not suck yet?
[5:41:44] <Chorkly> Bro Nago's OD when he works.
[5:41:46] <DianaTheAscian> Nago is solid rn
[5:41:50] <NotHereToStream> I think woolie has a very good nago
[5:41:55] <+MisterArcanine> @zerocount oh yeah but I‚Äôve been so busy I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to take more things . I learned from Nemo I can do Counter 2D into back turn
[5:41:56] <+shogun_133> Nago? suck? what the hell?
[5:42:00] <DianaTheAscian> much better than in the beta
[5:42:03] <Chorkly> all woolie needs are those sweaty gamer combos on lock
[5:42:15] <%FallenAngelZelos> Once you realize how to control his meter he gets way better
[5:42:17] <agrocraig01> is this a npc?
[5:42:20] <+shogun_133> I think what you meant to say is anjie
[5:42:24] <%FallenAngelZelos> Blood meter that is
[5:42:35] <DianaTheAscian> Nago awards patience
[5:42:37] <CheyMix> has wollie been playing strive off stream since its realease?
[5:42:40] <NotHereToStream> yeah, some players use the blood meter to their advantage
[5:42:43] <%RyTYoung> @agrocraig01 no he's in the tower
[5:43:09] <Chorkly> so from 0-2 pips nago tends to go mad with specials for the mix. then on 2 pips you get very good normals
[5:43:09] <+shogun_133> High skill ceiling does not mean someone sucks bte. Nago stomps ass if you can read
[5:43:17] <agrocraig01> @rytyoung got ha thanks just joined, not familiar with game
[5:43:24] <DianaTheAscian> Nice
[5:43:24] <CheyMix> if im not mistaken nagos clone crushes leos projectile
[5:43:28] <Chorkly> and then nago also has made damage
[5:43:33] <theredfox930000> woolie establishing he knows how to play
[5:43:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> We are made by the Unga undone by the Bunga
[5:43:48] <DianaTheAscian> Nago's clone crushes most projectiles
[5:44:03] <%Lion_kun> what is that super tiny gray bar at the bottom of the blue bar and why is it so small?
[5:44:05] <Chorkly> oh he did the jiyuna tech
[5:44:11] <SkinnyRite> stance tech wins again!
[5:44:12] <%RyTYoung> @agrocraig01 no bother SeemsGood
[5:44:12] <NotHereToStream> the issue with the clone is the blood meter, they take up alot of blood
[5:44:13] <Chorkly> @Lion_kun nago's blood
[5:45:11] <screwintuna> I want to play this game so bad
[5:45:15] <+shogun_133> Hard matchup but your getting it.
[5:45:19] <Chorkly> @Lion_kun oh apologies that's the risk you're looking at. the more you block the more the next time you get hit hurts.
[5:45:25] <ZeroCount> That was a good one!
[5:45:38] <DianaTheAscian> Wow
[5:45:52] <radar410> @Lion_kun It's small cause they don't want new people looking at it
[5:45:52] <%Lion_kun> @Chorkly That seems like very important information. Why is the bar so tiny lol
[5:45:59] <ZeroCount> I wanna play but everyone runs from my character even though I'm not good
[5:46:01] <screwintuna> I gotta go play the missing link to get my GG fill
[5:46:03] <+fetrigon> so much respect
[5:46:04] <DianaTheAscian> F
[5:46:06] <cheapdoc> yo, this match is kindda fire
[5:46:09] <Chorkly> @Lion_kun Daisuke's vision. No one knows.
[5:46:29] <%RyTYoung> PERFECT
[5:46:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:46:34] <Chorkly> can you throw Leo's dp?
[5:46:39] <ZeroCount> Yeah
[5:46:43] <+MisterArcanine> You can but it‚Äôs hard
[5:46:48] <DianaTheAscian> was that a perfect?
[5:46:49] <ZeroCount> You can throw all dps in the game
[5:46:53] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> PERFECT! Nice Woolie!
[5:46:54] <theredfox930000> woolie come on brother you got this

[5:47:11] <NotHereToStream> or you can charge dust his H DP
[5:47:24] <cheapdoc> no kidding ... huh
[5:47:28] <BaslerJones> is this a bonus stream or did something happened ot the schedule ?
[5:47:32] <NotHereToStream> but sometimes a throw is better because unburstable damage
[5:47:35] <+MisterArcanine> After a lot of whiff‚Äôs DPs you can get a free Dust
[5:47:37] <ZeroCount> Dp's are only strike invincible
[5:48:26] <cheapdoc> damn, good blocks

[5:52:20] <%RyTYoung> I did play some Leo in the beta, I thought I was going to pick him up before Ky
[5:52:23] <cheapdoc> @seycheles guilty woolie
[5:52:27] <+IronBagel1> @woolieversus stance is negative, but it can be stance canceled to leave me plus
[5:52:42] <+IronBagel1> the overhead that is
[5:52:45] <Chorkly> @IronBagel1 is that just with the double down input?
[5:52:49] <+IronBagel1> yep
[5:52:52] <%Deft_Thought> Ky's theme Kreygasm
[5:53:00] <+MisterArcanine> Wait so if you cancel the overhead you can be plus???
[5:53:06] <+IronBagel1> Leo can stance cancel all his back turn normals
[5:53:06] <Heefnoff> Yes @misterarcanine
[5:53:15] <+IronBagel1> plus 4 or 5 I believe?
[5:53:15] <Chorkly> that's spicy
[5:53:18] <+MisterArcanine> That‚Äôs sick
[5:53:28] <cheapdoc> that's a regular sol right there
[5:53:32] <Heefnoff> Leo‚Äôs just great rn
[5:53:37] <Chorkly> can you interrupt the overhead?
[5:53:40] <%jinking79> autopilot stance
[5:53:40] <NotHereToStream> can you reverse beat his hs or s?
[5:53:40] <Heefnoff> Gets real good in backturn
[5:53:49] <+MisterArcanine> Normally I just overhead into counter if it whiffs and they wanna jab into it
[5:54:12] <cheapdoc> I haven't had that much trouble with the dolphin, the anchor follow up gets bad tho
[5:54:34] <Chorkly> dude anti-airing May actually gives me a hernia.

[5:56:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Imagine blocking Kappa
[5:56:54] <DianaTheAscian> He never has to stop
[5:56:56] <%RyTYoung> Sol just looks so small up against Nago LUL

[5:58:03] <SvenHolgersson> I like it
[5:58:05] <cheapdoc> Bully this gorilla woolie
[5:58:20] <+atin2000> man, I tried getting into this game in the beta, but even on floor i couldnt fight people around my skill level, so i just bounced
[5:58:21] <Chorkly> man I do not understand the frame data on bandit bringer
[5:58:24] <Powersurge145> No blocks. Just go forward.
[5:58:30] <cheapdoc> SUSUMEEEEE
[5:58:34] <SunsetJack> Air BB 0 on block is screwed up.
[5:58:34] <+YawnSong_> i respect it tnh

[5:59:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Oh no the gorilla got a taste of victory
[5:59:28] <SunsetJack> Who needs to block if your risk/reward is obnoxiously huge.
[5:59:32] <+IronBagel1> blocks are not found in celestial
[5:59:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> He will block even less

[6:04:05] <%RyTYoung> This guy is insane
[6:04:14] <+shogun_133> keep getting all the hard matchhups
[6:04:18] <cheapdoc> @Chorkly No kidding, this dood's the cleanest
[6:04:18] <DianaTheAscian> A very strong Ky
[6:04:25] <+MisterArcanine> You simply cannot challenge the People‚Äôs elbow
[6:04:31] <mikeiskill> man, Nago's really just got sit there and hold that pressure, huh?
[6:04:39] <%RyTYoung> The 6P is too strong
[6:04:40] <cheapdoc> This player right here is like the anti-sol
[6:04:54] <Chorkly> so I saw Ky gets a safe jump foudre arc after dire eclat knockdown
[6:04:56] <Chorkly> shit's mad
[6:04:56] <+LordAngry> Slick round
[6:05:00] <DianaTheAscian> Nice
[6:05:05] <NotHereToStream> cool looking combo
[6:05:07] <+shogun_133> he just needs an opening ky will fall apart after
[6:05:14] <+yamidemon666> nago masteer
[6:05:30] <cheapdoc> ride the flex
[6:05:30] <%RyTYoung> Suuuuper fucking clean
[6:05:42] <%RyTYoung> Barely whiffing
[6:05:53] <cheapdoc> not a wasted move
[6:06:02] <Chorkly> I love that good Ky's are just playing well
[6:06:05] <Serge_12> He lives up to his name
[6:06:06] <NotHereToStream> man ride the lightning is a very good super
[6:06:13] <Mahbonk> dat anti swipe burst
[6:06:16] <+LordAngry> I mean, level 1400 or something, dudes feeling himself goddamn
[6:06:17] <%RyTYoung> I need to play as clean as this guy right here
[6:06:18] <Chorkly> how do I get good as Ky? Well you see you play better.
[6:06:20] <+MisterArcanine> His spacing is just so clean
[6:06:20] <DianaTheAscian> A crazy good Ky
[6:06:25] <NotHereToStream> fucking clean as fuck
[6:06:25] <+UnfilteredComic> This guy must have a bathroom setup with how clean he is
[6:06:26] <cheapdoc> that is not just ky that is Ky

[6:06:42] <CheyMix> uncle sweetness
[6:06:54] <%RyTYoung> @chorkly imma jot that down for later
[6:07:18] <DianaTheAscian> oof
[6:07:22] <Chorkly> @RyTYoung it's on a note behind my monitor
[6:07:34] <+LordAngry> Ky feels like it's impossible to hit a c.S on, his moves just space so nicely
[6:07:37] <SunsetJack> These ticks are getting to him.
[6:07:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:07:45] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> SHEEEEESH
[6:07:46] <point4effort> That an actual nago color or is it a mod?
[6:07:52] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> mod
[6:07:52] <DianaTheAscian> mod
[6:07:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Is activating Nago blood even worth it? It eats your life so fast
[6:07:52] <Mahbonk> mod
[6:07:55] <zenith0111> Is there any top Nago players you watch?
[6:08:05] <NotHereToStream> never worth it to pop blood rage
[6:08:17] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> this is the best ky i've ever seen
[6:08:22] <DianaTheAscian> @sonofthedeepsouth never worth avoid at all cost
[6:08:25] <+gutlesscoward> @sonofthedeepsouth that's the point, it's a punishment
[6:08:25] <Chorkly> round start foudre? the disrespect
[6:08:38] <%jolene_orenji> @sonofthedeepsouth nago's whole gameplan is trying to get as close to popping without actually popping because having a high blood meter gives you better normals and damage but blood rage is so terrible
[6:08:49] <zenith0111> Ky is pretty solid is strive tbh. Well assuming shock state at least
[6:08:49] <SunsetJack> Wow, he is toying.
[6:08:52] <DianaTheAscian> WOW

[6:09:57] <zenith0111> A Ky who knows what hes doing monkaS
[6:10:00] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i'm noticing he kicks a lot, i need to start doing that
[6:10:08] <+LordAngry> These are they players you want to download. I wish twitch API would give the stream the inputs.
[6:10:12] <zenith0111> His kicks are mad plus
[6:10:22] <Chorkly> @AlwaysReturningVideotapes LK and C.S are Ky's go to pressure starters.
[6:10:38] <NotHereToStream> jesus ky's oki is so meaty
[6:10:59] <taken_lul> is it normal for people to know the range vy heart like that?
[6:11:01] <%thedankestmeeme> jjjjjjjijjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj.
[6:11:03] <taken_lul> that looked cool
[6:11:10] <DianaTheAscian> Damn
[6:11:20] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> @Chorkly i use 2S a LOT, is that a bad idea?
[6:11:44] <+Ultimate_Edge> LUL
[6:11:47] <Chorkly> @AlwaysReturningVideotapes 2S is an amazing spacing tool, so that's good as well. It's not bad on knockdown, but I wouldn't say it's fantastic.
[6:11:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[6:11:54] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[6:11:55] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> gotcha
[6:11:58] <+UnfilteredComic> Nah that was a legendary bait :)
[6:12:00] <+MisterArcanine> Nago is also just in general a very strong match for Ky tbh
[6:12:05] <NotHereToStream> this ky got woolie downloaded
[6:12:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BE HARDER ON YOURSELF WOOLIE. You play better
[6:12:09] <%RyTYoung> You got this Woolie I believe in Nago
[6:12:16] <SunsetJack> Damn, not negative yet
[6:12:25] <DianaTheAscian> Running laps
[6:12:30] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> OH
[6:12:40] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> LMAO
[6:12:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Eats it
[6:12:42] <%RyTYoung> OOOO
[6:12:46] <NotHereToStream> this ky don't miss
[6:12:49] <Chorkly> Man Ky's kinda nice in this game.
[6:12:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> No Unga Bungas in this man
[6:12:59] <%RyTYoung> again?
[6:13:06] <DianaTheAscian> Thats a very very good Ky
[6:13:12] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i want to see how this ky would fight a ram
[6:13:16] <%RyTYoung> I am inspired
[6:13:38] <CheyMix> follow him on guilty gram
[6:13:41] <%RyTYoung> Ram v Ky is a tough time
[6:13:44] <CheyMix> i know i am
[6:14:11] <+Arnschen> Oh, I didn't know you could skip to the next round?
[6:14:17] <%Lion_kun> I wonder how much longer Woolie is gonna go for.
[6:14:42] <Chorkly> remember Ky's only plus after 6K and certain foudres
[6:14:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:14:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[6:14:57] <@Moobot> @sonofthedeepsouth WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 27 minutes
[6:14:58] <Chorkly> and charged fireball obv
[6:15:15] <StagnettisRevenge> He's also plus if you meaty 5k
[6:15:22] <Chorkly> so dire eclat is minus. Sol can punish with 6 HS
[6:15:28] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> it's positive on courch block
[6:15:29] <StagnettisRevenge> DE is like -11 or something
[6:15:31] <WakeUpThrow> Ohhhh, lab stream?
[6:15:32] <Chorkly> unless it hits you and you're in SS
[6:15:36] <SunsetJack> God, I hope they add more features...
[6:15:44] <DianaTheAscian> thats a cool pose you paused on
[6:15:58] <Equirah> is the stream over?
[6:15:59] <NotHereToStream> isn't that kick actually punishable if you stand block it?
[6:16:02] <%RyTYoung> Sorry to sound dumb, but does it mean to be plus or positive? I'm gonna be looking at frame data tomorrow so if it's too much to explain I can't wait
[6:16:09] <%RyTYoung> what does*
[6:16:16] <Chorkly> @NotHereToStream no, it ranges from -2 at worst to like plus 11
[6:16:18] <%RyTYoung> can*
[6:16:18] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> @NotHereToStream yes
[6:16:18] <SunsetJack> You can't move before they do.
[6:16:27] <SunsetJack> If someone is plus, they move before you.
[6:16:29] <+rairaku> it means you dont suffer from a disadvantage when it whiffs or misses
[6:16:29] <+IronBagel1> @RyTYoung it means the number of frames you can act before the opponent
[6:16:46] <Equirah> oh no, wollie is talking. jut's the screen frozen LUL
[6:16:48] <Chorkly> @RyTYoung so plus means that person recovers first. if a move is plus on block the person doing the move recovers quicker
[6:17:04] <+IronBagel1> So if you're plus, you can act first, so it is "your turn" so to speak
[6:17:13] <SunsetJack> He really die toyed with him..
[6:17:35] <Equirah> @RyTYoung also plus and positive are different things. you get the positive state by breaking the wall
[6:17:45] <%livlinn> !uptime
[6:17:45] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 30 minutes
[6:17:50] <SunsetJack> Ky is weird.
[6:17:52] <Chorkly> positive state is only a guilty gear strive thing though
[6:18:04] <+0neReeler> didn't jump?
[6:18:17] <%RyTYoung> Ty guys I got positive and plus confused haha
[6:18:23] <DianaTheAscian> Yeah it sucks
[6:18:33] <+IronBagel1> ky has always had small hurtbox oddities
[6:18:38] <+IronBagel1> same in +R
[6:18:43] <NotHereToStream> why not 214K into 6S?
[6:18:50] <NotHereToStream> sorry 236 k
[6:18:55] <Equirah> you were at 1
[6:19:25] <+OrangeMDT> That‚Äôs not everybody? Long distance 214hs doesn‚Äôt usually combo into 6hs
[6:19:29] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i feel like ky kind of bullies the heavier characters
[6:19:35] <Equirah> oh, wollie doesn't start counting at 0
[6:19:40] <NotHereToStream> actually could you do another 2S after the beyblade attack
[6:20:01] <Chorkly> tbh everyone kinda bullies the heavies on knockdown

[6:20:49] <+Ultimate_Edge> There's always not hitting a follow up for more comfortable oki
[6:20:59] <Chorkly> Ky's jab is 5 frames and minus.
[6:21:10] <Chorkly> same as his crouch jab
[6:22:13] <CheyMix> dust?
[6:22:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[6:23:06] <Chorkly> Ky's DP is also kinda whack. 11 frames and can be command grabbed/low profiled. As per.
[6:23:44] <%RyTYoung> God rays
[6:23:48] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i can never vapor thrust on wakeup
[6:23:48] <NotHereToStream> yeah, sol's 2D makes ky's DP whiff
[6:24:10] <%RyTYoung> @alwaysreturningvideotapes same
[6:24:13] <A1_Mistake_Sauce> is the point of a safe jump to block a dp but hit if they dont?
[6:24:18] <%kennneh> Any recs for first time visitors to Mtl?
[6:24:21] <Chorkly> 3 frame input buffer baby.
[6:24:28] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[6:25:00] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> i'm so jealous of leo's DP, it's so easy
[6:25:04] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[6:25:09] <Chorkly> @A1_Mistake_Sauce yes. As dp's are slow you can get a button up which will hit if they block, but you'll recover in time to block if they dp.
[6:25:25] <Chorkly> slow in general, and very slow compared to street fighter
[6:25:27] <%Daniel_Is_I> I'm jealous of anyone that gets a meterless reversal
[6:25:34] <NotHereToStream> oof, a failed kara buster
[6:25:48] <+Arnschen> I wonder if Goldlewis will also not have an air dash
[6:25:59] <A1_Mistake_Sauce> @A1_Mistake_Sauce oh ok thanks
[6:26:16] <%townzzzzz> UNSTOPABLE
[6:26:20] <NotHereToStream> no meter to FD
[6:26:43] <Mahbonk> big boy don't wanna get hugged :c
[6:27:16] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> sheesh the blocks on this dude
[6:27:27] <+Arnschen> Woof
[6:27:37] <%RyTYoung> nice
[6:28:20] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> OH GOD
[6:28:20] <%slayabee> OOF
[6:28:20] <Mahbonk> yikes
[6:28:23] <Chorkly> this mans pc is hurting
[6:28:24] <+Arnschen> Geez
[6:28:27] <+LordAngry> The ol' walmart wifi
[6:28:31] <%eyezehuhh> woolie is in the zone
[6:28:34] <+Arnschen> Both times you got that counter
[6:28:34] <Chorkly> strive really needs a stress test
[6:28:39] <randomdude365> Mom kick the box
[6:28:45] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> LUL
[6:28:47] <+Arnschen> Okay yeah
[6:28:59] <+LordAngry> Bro playing on the Steam Deck early access
[6:29:00] <+Charmy4> Isn't that the issue that happens with people playing in 4k?
[6:29:03] <NotHereToStream> aerial blockstun are longer, you can't really go for a command grab
[6:29:13] <tummysunday> Lookin like Haomaru with this slowdown
[6:29:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:29:15] <CheyMix> @Charmy4 yes
[6:29:24] <+Arnschen> LUL
[6:29:36] <%slayabee> Is this guy doing it on purpose or is the game bugging?
[6:29:40] <Chorkly> could of RC'd in and grabbed the super?
[6:29:44] <%jolene_orenji> I'M A CLOWN OF FAIIIIIIITH
[6:29:47] <NotHereToStream> could of challenged the startup
[6:29:51] <%Irridium> bro going even further boyond the rollback
[6:30:04] <%RyTYoung> omg trying to play strive on the tiny face buttons of a steam deck would be akin to playing SF IV on 3DS
[6:30:05] <MovieHipster> 35 seconds left sheesh long game
[6:30:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> I've grabbed it like once. It's tough.
[6:30:39] <NotHereToStream> you don't have to grab to challenge, a hit is more than enough to stuff it, if you are early enough
[6:30:40] <tummysunday> Gotta be like point blank no?
[6:30:43] <Chorkly> yeah I don't like doing it, but sometimes you gotta.
[6:30:54] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> almost looks like intentional slowdown lol
[6:31:04] <Chorkly> I'm pretty sure that's because of the other guys rig
[6:31:08] <NotHereToStream> a 2S for nago would be enough to prevent aegis
[6:31:11] <+TheDukeofGrease> it happens to me too. That super bust in FPS when you couterhit. IDK why
[6:31:11] <Chorkly> considering woolie isn't dropping frames.
[6:31:15] <%slayabee> Seriously wtf is that
[6:31:25] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> it's allllllllmost cinematic
[6:31:27] <%slayabee> Jesus man on EVERY big counter hit?
[6:31:30] <NotHereToStream> is it only for heavy counter?
[6:31:31] <+Arnschen> Ye
[6:32:03] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> wooliePOYO
[6:32:12] <tummysunday> Makes me think of what Sajam said about people‚Äôs rigs not being able to run strive
[6:32:13] <%RyTYoung> wooliePOYO
[6:32:37] <%Deft_Thought> I'm bummed. I'm stuck using wireless in my current apartment so I haven't been playing any fighters
[6:32:45] <NotHereToStream> is that the only downside of PC strive, its the different rigs causing rollback issue
[6:32:55] <%jolene_orenji> it's gotta be a performance thing
[6:33:00] <Chorkly> @NotHereToStream that and connecting to server yeah
[6:33:01] <tummysunday> Most likely
[6:33:02] <Heefnoff> I think they‚Äôve got a bad computer ueah
[6:33:08] <Heefnoff> Performance problem
[6:33:10] <%slayabee> Is it just this person or this MU?
[6:33:11] <NotHereToStream> bruh
[6:33:15] <MovieHipster> if one player's PC hits a frame drop due to bad specs, that causes the hella slowdown
[6:33:20] <%Deft_Thought> My apartment is on the second floor of an old house, and apparently that means the cable company won't install a new line because its considered one residence
[6:33:29] <%SirGO0SE> holy shit you can do that
[6:33:38] <%SirGO0SE> air grab combo into another air grab?
[6:33:38] <Blackscience91> Their cpu is on fire from the simulating and the particle effects
[6:33:39] <%RyTYoung> that's wild the connection to the match looks good
[6:33:41] <Chorkly> @Deft_Thought couldn't you use a socket adapter?
[6:34:05] <%slayabee> Get outta there Woolz
[6:34:10] <%slayabee> Ain't worth
[6:34:13] <AlwaysReturningVideotapes> yeah maybe cut it with this dude
[6:34:14] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought I looked into it. My apartment is on a different circuit than the rest of the house so it won't work.
[6:34:17] <Chorkly> Man I'd dip after one match of that.
[6:34:23] <tummysunday> Potemkin with that anti combo passive
[6:35:10] <Chorkly> I think it's more if they wake up super. You can also drift RC in.
[6:35:28] <NotHereToStream> 2S?
[6:35:39] <+itsgundamu> I think its like 11 frames
[6:35:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yup 2s
[6:35:53] <%jolene_orenji> honestly the best advice w/ giganter kai IMO is to just block like w/ nago blood rage. it's hard to jump over and hard for pot to gain ground if he's not using it in your face
[6:35:56] <SunsetJack> Wait, it was one hit on close up?
[6:36:08] <zenith0111> Its one of the best supers SeemsGood Love using it as Potemkin
[6:36:13] <%jolene_orenji> @SunsetJack yeah if you use it right in their face it's one massive hit instead of 3 smaller ones
[6:36:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:36:25] <+itsgundamu> @SunsetJack yea it has an initial hitbox that only hits once if that doesn't hit he sends out the wall
[6:36:30] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> you gonna have to hold that one, big fella
[6:36:39] <Chorkly> super losing is wild
[6:36:44] <NotHereToStream> you already gave him the knock down, why hesistate on the 2S oki
[6:36:44] <+sonofthedeepsouth> NO
[6:36:48] <zenith0111> OOF
[6:36:50] <%SirGO0SE> it just wins
[6:36:53] <+itsgundamu> he only has a grab hitbox for the first 11 frames
[6:36:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> NOPE
[6:36:59] <Blackscience91> That neat. Good to know.
[6:37:02] <SunsetJack> It is +1 on block too uh..
[6:37:02] <Heefnoff> Oh wow
[6:37:07] <%RyTYoung> Gonna dip out dudes, ty all who were helpful earlier I appreciate it doodHey
[6:37:19] <NotHereToStream> woolie, why hesistate on an oki?
[6:37:22] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> heavy mob beats a gang of supers or they just tcancel each other out
[6:37:25] <bearwagon> LUL
[6:37:29] <+tabenterenter> Grab that Potemkin lol
[6:37:34] <Chorkly> Drift RC is your friend.
[6:37:54] <SunsetJack> Pot has insane comeback potential so it is very scary to lose advantage.
[6:38:08] <%slayabee> Real quick: Is it just me or are grabs in this game kinda weird?
[6:38:08] <Heefnoff> You might as well back up against him maybe? That‚Äôd also help keep the blood gauge down
[6:38:11] <%Exiliator> Woolie solo streams are nice
[6:38:12] <+IHATREID> whens the tier list for youtube points willie
[6:38:14] <zenith0111> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[6:38:15] <+itsgundamu> yea if you can keep the pressure on him he struggles but if you give him an inch he'll take a mile
[6:38:23] <%Exiliator> I enjoy them now and then
[6:38:24] <Jontman42> good games
[6:38:31] <%Deft_Thought> @WoolieVersus Thanks for streaming, Woolie. This was a fun one to watch,
[6:38:34] <DianaTheAscian> Lots of fun matches
[6:38:37] <NotHereToStream> good session
[6:38:46] <%RyTYoung> @woolieversus thanks for the stream!
[6:39:01] <%Exiliator> Hoping for helltaker at some point
[6:39:01] <+RojanBo> Killer stream!!!!
[6:39:04] <RevolverOcelot16> Thanks for the stream.
[6:39:19] <Chorkly> Big man wools holding down the stream.

[6:39:33] <NotHereToStream> he did helltaker
[6:39:43] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought And thanks for the recommend @Chorkly. I'm trying to find an alternative because I can't run a cable through to the other apartment because of where the router is located.
[6:40:00] <+sonofthedeepsouth> It does not ship for my region woolie
[6:40:05] <+tabenterenter> Only spooky jogos. Ha. Thank for the stream.
[6:40:05] <+LordAngry> peace
[6:40:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bye
[6:40:05] <Chorkly> @Deft_Thought No worries man! Sorry it doesn't work.
[6:40:08] <%Exiliator> byebye
[6:40:09] <Wan6Saber> later dude
