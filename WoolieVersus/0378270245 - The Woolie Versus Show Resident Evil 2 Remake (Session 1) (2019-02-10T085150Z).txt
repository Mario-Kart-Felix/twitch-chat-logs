Reddit user jpDeathBlade, the user who discovered this, tested it on head shots and he would get head splits every time. Crit shots are essentially “just frames”

[0:25:19] <%FriendStaffen> There is such a thing as T-virus immunity
[0:25:21] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> That's not YOUR blood
[0:25:21] <Psykoknight65> I think its just all the protagonists are immune
[0:25:21] <dukenux> In your heeeeead, it's in your heeeeeeeaaaaaad~

[0:25:31] <ComradeIrah> zooooombieeeeee
[0:25:32] <+flustered__> Why does Leon have such good jackets
[0:25:32] <$BioStormX> Maybe Leon and Claire are just slightly more immune to the T Virus, which is why they're some of the only survivors
[0:25:33] <%yuribo26> Don't worry about it
[0:25:33] <+The_UnfathoMarble> Isn't the T-Virus just efficient on 80% of the population?

[0:25:40] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus 10% of the pop is immune to the virus
[0:25:41] <%jinking79> unless your Jill

[0:39:41] <Cthulos> Well dark souls was made in 1989
[0:39:44] <gatorafan> I guess RE2 was the Dark Souls of survival horror huh Kappa

[0:52:55] <+atlasbot1> Hey pat or woolie do you guys plan to make an edited version of the stream that makes it feel like the youtube format
[0:52:56] <scrubviewer> the light on cotrollerreflects health
[0:52:57] <%laserbeaming> This is requested backseating, so it's OK
[0:53:01] <gustavozxd> oh no zombies can fucking dash cancel towards you

[0:53:10] <Bdran> acsterYoungsoulja
[0:53:11] <Tgsnum5> Yeah on Hardcore you're gonna run the fuck out almost immediately trying to kill everything lol
[0:53:12] <KeiPrime> they're command grabbing
[0:53:13] <The_Introspector> you can run past not how you did it though
[0:53:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Don't get grabbed, why is this so complicated?
[0:53:16] <fuji_92> FRAME DATA THE ZOMBIES

[0:53:27] <%GohanEgret> @atlasbot1 woolie will likely put up a stream highlight video, but I doubt he does a part 1/2/3 LP style video series
[0:53:31] <ClarkWasHere> it's bullshit sometimes. the zombie you need to avoid to get past theRPD gate fucking turns around instantly
[0:53:31] <%Fattness132> Stun them first before running past
[0:53:32] <lethallylactic> Point => shoot to stagger => run past NotLikeThis
[0:53:33] <doomerskeletor13> DROP THE SHIELD
[0:53:34] <+jayfigga> just parry
[0:53:34] <amiavamp> It's a fighting game where throws track

[0:53:54] <HitchhikingThrough> IDK why the fuck ya'll complaining, this is what I came for
[0:53:54] <%Solidnick18> No dodge rolls
[0:53:54] <%krispen_wa> Woolie wants to fast roll past zombies
[0:53:55] <KeystoneA1> Woolie killed a guy on the football field
[0:53:57] <+tigerfang86> remember when woolie killed that guy
[0:53:57] <Graxe_> The quick turn is just that. A quick turn.
[0:53:57] <colorofillusion> Woolie is scared

[0:54:05] <%UrsulaCat> woolie the football player
[0:54:05] <AHandito> I didn't notice Pat was crossing his legs, so the tiny cam made me think he is at THUNDER THIGH status.

[0:54:21] <fuji_92> UNEQUIP YOUR CLOTHES FOR FAST ROLL WOOLS l
[0:54:22] <+xbiohazard696x> yea i just pop a few shots till he stumbles and run by
[0:54:22] <+DreyfussFrost> ONLY if it staggers. Chest shots usually don't stagger.
[0:54:22] <%QueequegTheater> Is Tom Brady a stand user
[0:54:23] <cheddie_gibbs> has he seen the zombo with the ripped up face yet?
[0:54:23] <+Eddy21forsaken> the shot has to stun

[0:54:30] <+MechaBaphomet> wtf is this over technical explanation, just shoot and avoid.
[0:54:30] <RyanTheRecluse> Shoot legs for more consistent stagger

[1:10:40] <+thebonebard> nah hes right this time
[1:10:40] <+Weeewer> Is Part explaining everything too much?
[1:10:41] <Kghaleon> Shoot them in the face 2-3 times until they fall down and kill them with the knife, that's the optimal way D:
[1:10:41] <%galaxyswirl> BUT ONLY SOMETIMES
[1:10:42] <Pygmalionic> Not on Hardcore BibleThump
[1:10:42] <LegendaryDorkKnight> wake up super that zambo

[1:10:44] <faegbeard> 「CRAZY TALK」
[1:10:44] <+SpaciousWheat> RE 4 does not suck compared to this lol its still good. also you can cripple them yeah and its more ammo efficient but they can be faster if you do that
[1:10:45] <%GuelermeDias> woolie you can dead space zombos
[1:10:50] <Revzero25> She talks crazy talk
[1:10:51] <I_speel_my_dreenk> Leon hasn't learned how to suplex yet, hasn't started watching wrestling
[1:10:51] <rad_dude123465> *SLAP SLAP*
[1:10:53] <CaptainFrankincense> you can slash zombies to death
[1:10:53] <%xXichibanballer> ayy

[1:10:57] <RyuShinden> 「CRAZY TALK」DO YOUR THING!
[1:10:58] <%MisterCrimson> @WoolieVersus dammit Pat, you know you're lying. It takes at least two slashes to confirm a kill
[1:10:59] <+JoeStillLife> BIG RULES
[1:11:02] <RiverBirch> He's explaining it now so that the rest of the stream can flow as "easily" as it can be.
[1:11:03] <EndingPegasus> has he played a resident evil game before?
[1:11:04] <amiavamp> Combat is Zombie Bad Touch
[1:11:05] <%sukiyakiwestern> you have to knife them twice to make sure they're dead
[1:11:06] <+runegod20> with how woolie was playing, there's honestly a chance he'd never figure half of that out
[1:11:06] <+ilasper1> FAST AND LOOSE
[1:11:06] <Belutima> PAT, I get the feeling like you are explaining TOO much sometimes.
[1:11:07] <Matufreak> can't some zombies pretend to be dead
[1:11:08] <MaximumSleep> "Attention all Lickers: You's a bitch, your mama's a bitch..."
[1:11:08] <$ooblagis> Crits can happen anywhere on the body, but they're only gauranteed kills on the head. Otherwise it's just 3x damage
[1:11:08] <+patriotrenegade> DO COMBO THO

[1:11:19] <+tigerfang86> Don't be FAST, be CALM
[1:11:20] <%galaxyswirl> and the faster you do, the more hits you take
[1:11:21] <+LCGOV> Man Woolie thinks that Mr X is a joke he's gonna get his asshole blown out for sure :D
[1:11:27] <gatorafan> This is not crazy doodBenny

[1:49:33] <thepiefoot> @DashXero I was under the impression that they only break it if you get close. There is also some scripted ones, like the one from the interrogation room
[1:49:35] <+ArcanumArcanum> There could be ANYTHING at the other windows. There could even be ZOMBIES

[1:49:49] <%DashXero> @thepiefoot Exactly.
[1:49:50] <%PlagueOfGripes> the window boarding system is more useful on a repeat playthrough. not so useful when you have to race through rooms you have never been in to board the windows up before they break in
[1:49:50] <bestwaifuritsu> Which zombie is the one one modeled after dmc Matt?

[1:50:08] <+DangerMan83> Unlike bullets, there are not enough boards for all relevant windows
[1:50:08] <+RafunkV> Everything is in limited supply
[1:50:09] <SomeDwarf> And there was only one right answer in terms of blocking the windows, because you literally never had to go to that first hallway ever again

[1:51:25] <snakemuho> but the zombies counter it though
[1:51:26] <LokimenD> It's pretty much magic honestly
[1:51:28] <KeiPrime> thats cause of evie and the mold tho
[1:51:28] <KeystoneA1> Ethan's lost limbs get reattached partly because of herbs and partly because he's infected with the Mold, which feeds on moisture and nutrients that herbs have
