[0:05:08] <LeaIsChill> Something has changed.
[0:05:11] <$megamonmon123> he did the inflation secret mission @woolieversus
[0:05:20] <TheGershon> I think you can fix that with the DCHDMI. But idk
[0:05:21] <WG101> "Mission Complete: Almost Died" when you were asleep
[0:05:33] <+ggbhtg> you feel stronger
[0:05:38] <dapperskeleton69> "mission complete: dream warriors"
[0:05:51] <$Jhylla81> There's hidden playable characters but I never unlocked them because it requires rings to buy them and I got too frustrated playing the game to collect enough rings to get more than maybe one.

[0:10:33] <Virokwet> LUL
[0:10:38] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> bcits bad

[0:11:11] <Thunderhog> EVO Kintobor?
[0:11:11] <WG101> ah yes, the best part about any party game: quizzes
[0:11:14] <SilverSnake55> Anyone has pointed out yet that the game's brightness is fucked up?
[0:11:18] <crimsonsaens> When is Minh going to eat Woolie to level up his garbage Sharingan?
[0:11:23] <dapperskeleton69> "which sonic character fucked rouge with an airpump? answer: all of the above"
[0:11:28] <Papa_Bearman> Forcejewels are the items.
[0:11:30] <tattleworm> it's ovi kintobor actually and i hate that i know that
[0:11:31] <$Jhylla81> Forcejewels are items
[0:11:34] <$megamonmon123> @thunderhog alt reality eggman
[0:11:49] <Prevot> it's probably cause of character limits
[0:11:49] <Vortigon> "What color are the bottom of Sonic's feet?"
[0:11:56] <$Jhylla81> That's no good
[0:11:57] <waterstealer> chip
[0:11:59] <WG101> @Vortigon oh that one's easy, blue
[0:12:03] <Solidnick18> Chip
[0:12:06] <Thunderhog> @megamonmon123 I know the name, but Evo as oposed to Ivo is hilarious to me
[0:12:07] <jaid251> The s in sonic stands for strand
[0:12:09] <gamefan6219> @startstoprepeat That sounds like "Robotnik" Backwards.
[0:12:11] <andrei11dr> But none of you motherfuckets know about Suny the giraffe

[0:12:42] <nin10play> Each character also has a board and battle special ability
[0:12:42] <tattleworm> @gamefan6219 it's exactly that, it's what eggman used to be back when he was good in the non-canon UK sonic comics
[0:12:46] <$Jhylla81> I beleive the hidden characters are Mecha Sonic, Super Sonic, Big and I forget the last one

[0:22:39] <Papa_Bearman> You can see your cards on your VMU.
[0:22:45] <gamefan6219> Does this game ruins friendships, or Mario Party>

[0:23:37] <dapperskeleton69> errybody gettin fuuuuuuuucked!
[0:23:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[0:23:46] <nin10play> Yeah if you have VMU's then you only you can see your own cards. Cause whoever draws the Eggman card that Woolie has will eat shit. So if someone can see it they will never take it unless forced
[0:23:52] <Papa_Bearman> If everyone has a VMU to see your cards, your cards are hidden on screen.
[0:23:59] <$Jhylla81> If you run out of rings you lose a turn
[0:24:05] <+Strigiform> look on your controller
[0:24:19] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, look at your controller when selecting a card.
[0:24:26] <dapperskeleton69> time for a battle battle battle

[0:25:15] <dapperskeleton69> badum tiss
[0:25:19] <$Jhylla81> This game has cool ideas but clumsy execution
[0:25:32] <WG101> @Jhylla81 so, it's your typical sonic game
[0:25:38] <+Lovliana> @dapperskeleton69 that doesn't make any sense
[0:26:05] <dapperskeleton69> nobody said it would
[0:26:10] <Jojoludens> its just like a wii u

[0:48:26] <%Irridium> sonic about to just beat up some poor old man
[0:48:27] <ExpressNode> Hudson Soft who made the mario party games made this to
[0:48:28] <crimsonsaens> Does Sonic have a special tile?
[0:48:33] <%tearfuldevil> he has fangs
[0:48:34] <+ktothec99> Arc Sys just released new GG trailer
[0:48:35] <majima666> robotniks stoner surfer granddad
[0:48:37] <%RyTYoung> uhhhhhh
[0:48:39] <Solid_Stro> Surfing Brah wants to battle
[0:48:40] <Solidnick18> that is not a yeti
[0:48:47] <majindusto> "HAD"
[0:48:50] <dapperskeleton69> when did salt party bwcome race wars
[0:48:50] <Solidnick18> the was old surfer man
[0:48:53] <+jiggy_snipe> cool yeti
[0:48:55] <zeroraider> Sonic has no tiles he just goes really fast
[0:48:56] <+koboldconsortium> Sonic doesn't have a personal tile. His personal skill is his movement doubles if he picks the same card twice. For example, if Sonic picks a 4 one turn, then another 4 the next turn, he can move 8 spaces on the second turn.
[0:48:58] <Ozavic> Game pitch: Highly cutthroat party game but the group can choose one player to get eliminated at the %50 mark (if unanimous) so everyone has to play nice
[0:49:00] <jackelzxaa> Sonic doesnt have a special tile, instead he has a special spindash mechanic which
[0:49:01] <jackelzxaa> Oh
[0:49:02] <%RyTYoung> Race war!
[0:49:11] <LeaIsChill> Humans are the real monsters

[0:49:14] <metalwater8> That was an old man with fang dentures
[0:49:20] <StuffHunter> His clothes looked like he at leas was wearing Yeti leather.
[0:49:20] <rubbishbinge> Old people are monsters
[0:49:32] <Papa_Bearman> The game doesn't tell you about the special board abilities for each character.
[0:49:42] <iDunnoHowToWrite> ROCK THE OLD MAN'S SHIT
[0:49:45] <Prevot> the inflation on Sonic world is off the charts
[0:49:47] <andrei11dr> Yeti has a family ! Chupacabra, Bigfoot ,other shit ,
[0:49:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Sonic doesn't fight humans, only makes out with them
[0:49:52] <Papa_Bearman> I think they alternate each turn.
[0:49:54] <Solidnick18> who knows
[0:49:55] <$Jhylla81> In a couple turns
[0:49:55] <HairyRavioliToad> @Ozavic I feel that would be extremely abuseable
[0:50:15] <jackelzxaa> You should watch a story cutscene after this match because the cutscenes in this game are something special

[1:10:05] <Triplicat> It's fucking astonishing Sonic the Hedgehog was a successful franchise. Most of the series is mediocre or terrible
[1:10:06] <Jalexster> This came out TWO YEARS after Mario Party. They had no excuse.
[1:10:07] <+skylerpilot> I keep telling people that Sonic Shuffle was terrible, no idea how some people have good memories of it
[1:10:11] <TigerClaws12> PJSalt LUL

[1:10:52] <Papa_Bearman> I hated Sonic Battle, but it was fucking 'The Last of Us' compared to this.
[1:10:56] <switchbored505> I can't believe you lose the rings from the board as well, that game can just ruin you.
[1:11:16] <+PrinceSilvermane> The Carbuncle is bad
[1:11:19] <mMayrro> CHOESE
[1:11:22] <DusK_The_Stray> Sonic has some great games, but when it hits the bottom of the barrel boy does it really do it.
[1:11:25] <Papa_Bearman> The Carbuncle Forcejewel will eat any other forcejewels you have.
[1:11:28] <+ggbhtg> just got back, sounds like they all hate the game now. as expected

[1:12:54] <Jojoludens> the OFF-off-brand
[1:12:55] <Jalexster> If Mario Party is cola, Sonic Shuffle is like drinking gasoline
[1:12:55] <Kahpoe_Lelou> Sonic shuffle is the RC cola of party game.

[1:22:04] <dapperskeleton69> hell gimme a fucking magic 8 ball
[1:22:09] <+PrinceSilvermane> The shuffling is so people can't just remember where your cards are when it's their turn
[1:22:29] <LeaIsChill> Literally anything else
[1:22:31] <Papa_Bearman> You could shuffle-shuffle-shuffle until you have a good card, which makes everyone having a deck completely pointless.

[1:23:11] <andrei11dr> Wat it really missed is Shuffle And Boogie playing
[1:23:15] <+PrinceSilvermane> Nah, all the maps are like that.
[1:23:16] <+FridayStreamer> way too many spaces in the map
[1:23:28] <Papa_Bearman> There must have been 250 spaces on that board. There's too much shit going on, and at the same time, not enough shit going on.
[1:23:51] <+ggbhtg> was there even a consistent way to get over 6 spaces?
[1:23:57] <$Jhylla81> I'd love to see a get into fighting games with Tech Romancer. That game doesn't get enough love. It even has Blodia as a hidden character
[1:23:59] <+Jazzputin> its no mario party but its still pretty fun

[1:24:06] <zeroraider> Yes the boards are WAAYY too big for how little you can move
[1:24:14] <ArgrettSuo> @helluvanohbody Sonic and the secret rings Party mode was better than this trash
[1:24:20] <floralkami> just coming from Pat stream. Was Sonic Shuffle okay?
[1:24:21] <Papa_Bearman> @ggbhtg You could roll an S, or you could use a Speederald-class forcejewel.
[1:24:23] <+Jazzputin> i also love how strange the creatures and aesthetic is
[1:24:25] <+pectusumbra> what are we talking about?
[1:24:33] <andrei11dr> He ain't playing Eternal because fuck you
[1:24:35] <+Jazzputin> it feels like a sonic dmt trip

[1:24:38] <rubbishbinge> @floralkami nope
[1:24:41] <%blackkanye> with how the minigames it wouldn't work
[1:24:42] <Solidnick18> The bullshit is always fun but not if the ai is always winning

[1:24:44] <+agumon9000> Dokapon allows 3 Kappa
[1:24:46] <nothuzad> Mp forces 4 but the AI isnt a super cheat

[1:35:45] <Solidnick18> that's a huge hit
[1:35:47] <+ggbhtg> Corona Virus: IS HINDSIGHT (year) 2020?!
[1:35:49] <%Irridium> and of course this would happen the year we get Marvel 2 back

[1:40:57] <+M08Xrd> oh
[1:40:59] <+prime_name> RollBack CBT sounds awful
[1:41:00] <floralkami> a week ago, I asked "what if this social distancing pandemic makes the online arcades close down and creates a lack of viable competition to play with delayed netcode in the East, and it made fighting game companies realize the need for rollback," as a joke. I'm kinda wondering if it had anything to do with Arcsys sudden decision...
[1:41:01] <+jiggy_snipe> Delay Based CBT would be a great podcast title
[1:41:03] <%kyh9> Rollback to to when the needle goes in

[1:41:20] <+nekodelic> OH SHIT
[1:41:21] <%Irridium> well if it's delay-based and you both get that delay you'll be stuck in the situation for a while
[1:41:21] <Jojoludens> you could rollback the B tho
