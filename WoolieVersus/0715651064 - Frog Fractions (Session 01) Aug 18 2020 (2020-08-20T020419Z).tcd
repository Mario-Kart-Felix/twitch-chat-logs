[0:50:40] <+Walopoh> Woolie made this game
[0:50:40] <+Vardek13> As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Felipe, boxing was a gentleman's game, in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end, until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.

[0:51:23] <+Vardek13> Ironically, it was Felipe's son, Andre Felipe Felipe, who developed what he called the ‚ÄúPunching‚Äù strategy, in 1637, after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down. When Andre Felipe Felipe challenged the then-champion, British expatriate ‚ÄúSleepless‚Äù Bill Bishop, to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favorite.

[0:53:52] <+Vardek13> Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis, and though they've achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big time.

[2:21:56] <Huntercd> Why is his wife so much cooler than him?
[2:21:57] <Polarix64> Oh yeah the Boxing speech
[2:21:59] <+Vardek13> When Andre Felipe Felipe challenged the then-champion, British expatriate ‚ÄúSleepless‚Äù Bill Bishop, to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favorite. You can imagine his surprise when, while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down ‚Äúfor the count,‚Äù in the parlance of our time.
[2:22:00] <%DensityD> which was the style at the time
[2:22:01] <heartlesshealer> Yeah it's the boxing speech
[2:22:04] <christopherwpoindexter> that music lowkey bumpin
[2:22:09] <+ItsRatman> Just talk VS Just fight
[2:22:15] <+Vardek13> While it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the game, officials were unable to find any actual rule that ‚ÄúPunching‚Äù violated, and were forced to let the victory stand.
[2:22:18] <+rottingpastry> Lick bag
[2:22:20] <%sparkly_yoyo> there's no rule that says a golden retriever can't play basketball

[2:22:57] <+LCGOV> The bug eating, the court room, the boxing
[2:22:59] <+Juriasu> oh shit a bagel would be nice
[2:23:00] <+Vardek13> Today's boxing enthusiasts fantasize about a newcomer that would rock the ring the way Felipe did. Calcification of the modern rule set has essentially locked the ‚ÄúPunching‚Äù strategy into place, but it's easy to get caught up in the fantasy.
[2:23:00] <christopherwpoindexter> SourPls
[2:23:00] <+rottingpastry> I can't believe you didn't talk about bagels
[2:23:11] <%DensityD> fruit pudding and coffee gelatin
[2:23:14] <+Vardek13> Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis, and though they've achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big time.
[2:23:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie is about to fight his daughter.
[2:23:26] <%DensityD> do it reggie, reach out with your HEART
[2:23:32] <+Vardek13> The real wonder, though, is that Andre Felipe's original vision of boxing is still around! Gentleman's Boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world. You can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.
[2:23:33] <%sssoapy> Don't worry Reggie you'll get it next time
[2:23:34] <%derap41> You've done the same stuff for years just reliving your past
[2:23:40] <christopherwpoindexter> wholesomeness isn't working....
[2:23:40] <%MayorRev> Scrambled eggs
[2:23:43] <+Vardek13> Most people only come to watch a few hours of a match and then leave, but every once in a while you'll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Felipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away... only to return to fight again another day.

[2:24:27] <+rottingpastry> It's san francisco. Anywhere else would be cheaper
[2:24:27] <+Vardek13> As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Felipe, boxing was a gentleman's game, in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end, until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.

[2:24:53] <+Vardek13> Ironically, it was Felipe's son, Andre Felipe Felipe, who developed what he called the ‚ÄúPunching‚Äù strategy, in 1637, after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down. When Andre Felipe Felipe challenged the then-champion, British expatriate ‚ÄúSleepless‚Äù Bill Bishop, to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favorite.

[3:23:32] <heartlesshealer> reggie has no idea how to digdug

[4:09:22] <skyheys> @akuda_bar The number one video game for everyone is Sudoku though?

[4:10:10] <ghoulishcripple> did anyone see the Oculus tweet that you'll need to connect your Facebook to use the oculus store?

[4:10:32] <%DensityD> !help
[4:10:32] <@akuda_bar> @ringabal i never say this, but i agree lol
[4:10:33] <$Fortunato5678> Yes
[4:10:36] <%sparkly_yoyo> Play Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha Vs The Soulless Army for the Sony Play Station Two
[4:10:38] <+Regigangster> It was a perfect execution for this game
[4:10:41] <%DensityD> !motivated
[4:10:41] <@Moobot> 1531 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:10:41] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe
[4:10:48] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[4:10:49] <skyheys> For the first stream itd be neat
[4:10:49] <%unclekulikov> i think it's worth finding out
[4:10:52] <gamewarden92> I want the mystery
[4:10:52] <%nxflre> reveal is better
[4:10:53] <BlackermanZX> i think thats just 50/50
[4:10:55] <DatAsuna> there's an appeal to both
[4:10:56] <%ozmon> Unfortunately, the answer's probably both
[4:11:11] <DedlokPM> That E3 tweet is basically a engagement bait tweet so they can actually get some engagement numbers so don't fall for it.
[4:11:12] <%Irridium> could also stop the spoiler talk that happens beforehand
[4:11:22] <%RadicalWeegee> Surprises are fun
[4:11:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:11:24] <+jiggy_snipe> that's true
[4:11:35] <+jiggy_snipe> your streams do start off as Just Chatting
[4:11:38] <DatAsuna> But also sometimes the game is the only reason they tune in too yeah
[4:11:41] <%RyTYoung> have I missed Paper Mario?
[4:11:52] <%doomerskeletor13> No
[4:11:52] <chll0ne> @rytyoung no
[4:11:58] <skyheys> Not telling also runs the risk of people going "OH, IT'S A BAD GAME THIS WEEK"
[4:11:59] <%doomerskeletor13> They played Frog Fractions
[4:11:59] <urkleturtle> the mystery reveal is better in people's head, but i bet posting which game is gonna be played is better for pulling in viewers
[4:12:01] <SomersaultJustice> so paper mario now?
[4:12:02] <%DensityD> BIG frog fractions stream
[4:12:07] <%RyTYoung> Ah cool
[4:12:15] <DedlokPM> @RyTYoung probably not doing it because they still have some frogs to fraction
[4:12:16] <%Javaa01> Yeah, and there's still like 40 minutes of game left after where you left off
[4:12:17] <ghoulishcripple> 8 dollar hat. 20 dollars of content
[4:12:26] <%ozmon> 16/4 hours of Frog Fractions
[4:12:28] <DatAsuna> hush was fun
[4:12:38] <%kyh9> Hush is good, it retains Batman's Detective origins
[4:12:39] <%Josef_Stryker> Hush is a solid pick.
[4:12:39] <skyheys> Hush is neat but *bad*
[4:12:45] <%Josef_Stryker> My personal fave Batman book is Court of Owls
[4:12:45] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs alright yeah
[4:12:51] <DatAsuna> I do have bones to pick with it, but spoilers
[4:12:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Court of Owls is good
[4:12:56] <%DensityD> is latest table lords up on the woolieVS youtube?
[4:13:05] <DatAsuna> isn't it just a special meal?
[4:13:07] <%Josef_Stryker> Scott Snyder's Batman run is amazing
[4:13:09] <%sparkly_yoyo> there was a tablelords?
[4:13:27] <%RadicalWeegee> @DatAsuna Its just a food , and a food you can make yourself
[4:13:53] <%WutangchickeN> smash controllers need to be a bar of soap
[4:13:58] <%WutangchickeN> there I did it
[4:14:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Grant Morrison Batman is basically Twin Peaks and Batman 66 thrown into a blender
[4:14:30] <skyheys> @josef_stryker Please go check out Denny O'Neil's batman
[4:14:49] <%AyotoCorp> I actually meant if you thought it was a good buy as a first fightstick for someone else
[4:14:51] <skyheys> He's extremely important to what the character is now
[4:14:52] <%DensityD> I think Fight Stick Graveyard is a Strong Name
[4:15:03] <%DensityD> Fighting Stick
[4:15:10] <ghoulishcripple> I know its cliche but there's something special to read a first edition run of The killing joke. it's so good it ruined the industry
[4:15:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Denny O‚ÄôNeil died recently I think
[4:15:13] <@Solidus_113> calling anything a graveyard is a strong name
[4:15:22] <kasios> smfh
[4:15:26] <skyheys> @doomerskeletor13 Yeah. sucks.
[4:15:28] <%DensityD> "no, we refer to it as the G.Y. now"
[4:15:39] <WeiLiHeng> so will there be TTYD later today? I'm slightly confused.
[4:15:42] <Explodincatz> pokemon graveyard
[4:15:48] <%sparkly_yoyo> there will be no ttyd
[4:15:49] <chll0ne> @weiliheng no
[4:15:51] <+jiggy_snipe> no TTYD today
[4:15:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Waiting for the sequel ‚ÄúGet In‚Äù

[4:16:58] <%doomerskeletor13> I throw the anime on in the background even though I‚Äôve seen the streams
[4:17:00] <DatAsuna> Remember if the anime isn't out in your region it's not for you
[4:17:03] <ghoulishcripple> the Anime is Kino watching for bedtime.
[4:17:03] <%DensityD> my hart. mah soul
[4:17:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> It feels like Woolie always flubs at least one word per message.
[4:17:08] <%sparkly_yoyo> You didn't buy the blurays, Nichijou died and it was your fault
