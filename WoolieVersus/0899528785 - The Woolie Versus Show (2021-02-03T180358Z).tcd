[0:05:28] <+TooManyGs> Any Yakuza fans wanna give me their impressions of 3? I'm about to start it and I have no clue what to expect
[0:05:34] <skewerstar> Oh wow, haven't managed to catch a live Yakuza stream in a while!
[0:05:35] <notsoy> notsoy subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:05:39] <RC_S3kshun8> @TooManyGs there will be crime
[0:05:40] <+TheShisno> Yakooooooozy!
[0:05:46] <CalderGaming> spiky... joe...
[0:05:51] <%Juriasu> 3 is great but it will feel a bit aged if you're coming from kiwami
[0:05:52] <jamox1> Yakuuuzy
[0:05:55] <skewerstar> Oh good! Woolie hasn't gotten to that part yet!
[0:05:56] <+EdenOfLove> music go quiet
[0:06:00] <+EdenOfLove> music track go change
[0:06:05] <SnaikerDragon22> @TooManyGs Expect jank, it was an early PS3 title riding off of the ORIGINAL Yakuza games on PS2. Also, you can fail substories
[0:06:15] <downwiththethickness99> Woohoo managed to catch a Yakuza stream
[0:06:18] <+EdenOfLove> I started 3 after playing 1 and 2, the graphics drop is... yikes
[0:06:25] <+EdenOfLove> but the story is interesting
[0:06:36] <%Lion_kun> 3 is the worst one lol
[0:06:41] <staple_boi> Omg you can fail substories
[0:06:42] <+EdenOfLove> much less "City-wide destruction" and more small battle over an orphanage
[0:06:44] <+coldsama> @toomanygs It's alright,it feel aged obviously, but it is quite short, and the story is great, however you can fail substories so save often
[0:06:44] <staple_boi> Why
[0:06:45] <%Juriasu> Kiryu is a wide boi in 3 and 4
[0:06:56] <%Feralspirit41> Now for the adventures of tow dudes who never killed anyone
[0:07:00] <AndyAsteroid> I CUM
[0:07:02] <%Feralspirit41> except that one guy woolie killed
[0:07:07] <leggojoseph> i'm currenty pushing through 3, but it's not so bad once you progress a little
[0:07:08] <skewerstar> Yeah yeah yeah! Hit me with that "We're all connected!"
[0:07:21] <SilverFaustX> tetris music
[0:07:24] <andre11dr> I think 6 is worse than 3
[0:07:25] <jamox1> I just picked up zero for 5 bucks yesterday
[0:07:29] <staple_boi> Tetris music
[0:07:30] <artiimo> ay i finally caught a yakuza stream
[0:07:32] <downwiththethickness99> Its a graphics drop because because it isnt a whole ass remake like Kiwami and Kiwami 2
[0:07:37] <%Feralspirit41> Fuckin tetris music is awesome
[0:07:38] <+NotHereToStream> man i need to get a tetris game, miss that game
[0:07:43] <CharlieDJohnson> i thought 4 was worse than 3 because they didnt figure out proper story pacing with multiple characters until 0 and speaking of story, 4 was by far the worst
[0:07:49] <@Menitta> Get Tetris Effect. It is good.
[0:07:58] <@Menitta> no, 4 is the best
[0:08:00] <downwiththethickness99> Its a remaster of a PS3 game
[0:08:01] <andre11dr> Nah i like 4
[0:08:01] <+krispen_wa> why is this song so good for a tetris game
[0:08:01] <staple_boi> Or get gamepass
[0:08:07] <artiimo> specially if you have vr it's a amazing
[0:08:08] <+TheShisno> Saw some good ol fashioned gatekeeping about "Real Yakuza" and "Nu-Yakuza" and I can say with perfect clarity, I'll be playing every game cause fuck you, One Guy
[0:08:09] <+coldsama> 4 have Akiyama so it's top tier
[0:08:10] <+TooManyGs> Thanks everyone! I appreciate it! this community is always so nice
[0:08:10] <SilverFaustX> kiwami 1 has the same engine as 0
[0:08:16] <staple_boi> Tetris effect is on Xbox gamepass
[0:08:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:17] <andre11dr> 4 is like my favorite one after 0 and 7
[0:08:18] <%Feralspirit41> How could you not like 4
[0:08:22] <%Lion_kun> 3 still has fun stuff. Like Majima. Or Andre Richardson.
[0:08:23] <benupde287> yall better play through mass effect collection
[0:08:28] <benupde287> p k
[0:08:28] <+Deko_> YEYEYE

[0:08:36] <%Feralspirit41> LORD OF TRASH
[0:08:37] <%notsoy> Finally subbed, been following since shortly before the Dokapon playthrough. A tip: the Body Counter ability is more like an alpha counter than a parry. I am testing it in my most recent 0 playthrough and its timing is very strict and you can get hit out of it. There are other abilities in Brawler (and other Styles) that function like Royal Release, which will probably be more your thing.
[0:08:38] <a_mad_dragon_> IT BEGINS
[0:08:39] <jamox1> Let’s gioooo

[0:08:49] <CharlieDJohnson> i mean its not like i dont like 4 just that i think its the worst out of a consistently pretty neat series
[0:08:52] <+TheShisno> RISE FROM TRASH, ASCEND TO CRIME
[0:08:53] <AndyAsteroid> 4 got a pretty dope finale, though where every protagonist gets it's own antagonist fight
[0:08:53] <staple_boi> NANI

[0:16:31] <%Kaito_Cam> it's all end and the ending is the extended cut by default
[0:16:32] <+TheShisno> Pinaccle Station is out cause it's fucky, but EVERYTHING ELSE is okay
[0:16:33] <+krispen_wa> Commander Shepard is best boi
[0:16:33] <spiderously> check yourself, before you Wrex yourself
[0:16:34] <digitalslime> ya, its because of dork not mystique
[0:16:37] <+Rancaliber_> Rancaliber_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 1 whole year? I don't believe it. Where'd the time go? Thanks to you Woolie, V, Reggie and the crew for all the good times. Keep on keeping on.
[0:16:38] <Blank9> thane and garrus cool too, but mordin tho
[0:16:42] <PanicSwytch> Garrus is best boi
[0:16:47] <staple_boi> @rc_s3kshun8 There's only one blue girl in my heart
[0:16:52] <RC_S3kshun8> lol
[0:16:56] <SherlockianHero> Me, a loser: I like Dragon Age. :)
[0:17:00] <Darren716> It has all 40 pieces of dlc
[0:17:13] <@Menitta> Its so good that they;re releasing this because playing the trilogy NOW is AWFUL. It has all the DLC. Greart
[0:17:15] <%Juriasu> @SherlockianHero dragon age is sick
[0:17:18] <@Menitta> It is mandatory
[0:17:18] <niddron> I can't fucking believe Javik was behind a paywall! fucked up
[0:17:19] <Darren716> I'm still pissed from 2012
[0:17:22] <+krispen_wa> hey guys, whats the square root of 912.04?
[0:17:23] <+BusterRepukken> dlc on disc
[0:17:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mandatory af
[0:17:25] <PanicSwytch> Pinnacle Station is not on ME1
[0:17:26] <+Ashaea> They won't have Pinnacle Station due to some corrupt data issues
[0:17:27] <staple_boi> @sherlockianhero LUL
[0:17:30] <Blank9> the fucking characters and plot
[0:17:32] <niddron> it was the biggest bullshit!!!
[0:17:33] <Darren716> I bought the Trilogy Collection assuming it came with the DLC
[0:17:34] <prime_name> Literally plot nessecary
[0:17:41] <AndyAsteroid> @WoolieVersus Woolie, you still down to Nioh, since new versions almost came out?
[0:17:41] <%Lion_kun> It's part of why 3 sucks.
[0:17:41] <Draco_Renegade> Javik should've been in the base game
[0:17:42] <Blank9> 2's dlc was ridiculous
[0:17:46] <+BlueJoneleth> imagine Kreia being DLC
[0:17:47] <brunoberserk> asura's wrath
[0:17:47] <glaciusinfinite> auras wrath
[0:17:51] <%Kaito_Cam> it's all end and the ending is the extended cut by default
[0:17:51] <andre11dr> REALLY IMPORTANT
[0:17:52] <@Menitta> THE TRUE ENDING
[0:17:55] <Solidnick18> that sucked
[0:17:55] <@Menitta> FUCK YOU PAY ME
[0:17:59] <+krispen_wa> that was SO DUMB
[0:18:01] <leggojoseph> what about the mafia 2 Ending behind a paywall/
[0:18:03] <Solidnick18> when i got to it
[0:18:03] <exnuart> final fantasy xiii-2 also locked the true end behind dlc
[0:18:04] <Lancaster_H> Javik was so obviously in the base game and cut afterwards its so stupid
[0:18:06] <+TheShisno> It doesn't have the training simulator DLC from 1 cause the source code got lost and they said it would take 6 months with their team to make it over from scratch
[0:18:09] <a_mad_dragon_> why does nobody shit on the 100-fetch-quest Dragon's Dogma DLC?
[0:18:12] <Darren716> The Legendary collection will be the first time I play the ME dlc
[0:18:14] <+Deko_> that so shitty
[0:18:15] <Jp_DrZaius> And now everyone is pirating it
[0:18:15] <Blank9> prince of persia
[0:18:18] <SereneFox> I think Final Fantasy 13-2 did that too, or at the very least, it ended on a To Be Continued screen
[0:18:20] <majindusto> Fuck Capcom for That
[0:18:24] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:18:28] <staple_boi> It's because they didn't get enough copies sold for a sequel
[0:18:29] <%JustToWatch> Asura's Wrath was terrible but god damn if that ending wasn't worth it
[0:18:30] <SilverFaustX> talk about judgment ps5 looking worse
[0:18:30] <+krispen_wa> @a_mad_dragon_ cause no one does it
[0:18:31] <AndyAsteroid> Prince of Persia's true ending was kind of shit, though. The original ending was way better.
[0:18:37] <Parapattern> Are you trying to help feed the homeless? I'LL KILL YOU!
[0:18:47] <staple_boi> So they had to finish the story in the first game
[0:18:54] <%Juriasu> especially not from bioware
[0:18:56] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:18:57] <+TheShisno> Never pre order, you will hate yourself
[0:18:57] <Jp_DrZaius> Preorder is bullshit
[0:19:00] <%caramelatte1> Why would you suck a dick?
[0:19:00] <SilverFaustX> never pre order
[0:19:02] <leggojoseph> yeah we should boycott that
[0:19:03] <+krispen_wa> But BIOWARE is my friend!
[0:19:04] <digitalslime> asuras wrath never worked for me. the cd didn't work on three 360's, but i gave back the copy i borrowed and it still worked for the owner.
[0:19:05] <%patriotrenegade> I want the exclusive tho
[0:19:06] <%Javaa01> There's no reason to pre-order this
[0:19:13] <bharcoot> preach
[0:19:15] <%jinking79> please but Advent Children Complete Edition
[0:19:20] <stygzing> I thought for asuras wrath, they ran out of money to finish it, so they used the sale of the game to finish it and release the ending, or was that misinformation?
[0:19:23] <Lancaster_H> TB is still alive
[0:19:24] <Solidnick18> that is a mistake to do
[0:19:25] <nintega010> I'll pre order if I want to
[0:19:26] <leggojoseph> shout out to the 76 pre-order
[0:19:27] <Kohei_kyouji> maybe explain why not to pre-order?
[0:19:29] <nmaten> rip
[0:19:32] <andre11dr> You buy Good Kid and you have to get Mad City as DLC LUL
[0:19:36] <Darren716> Imagine paying more money for the worst version of a game
[0:19:36] <Camail> LUL gotta have your principles
[0:19:36] <Blank9> AUGMENT YOUR PREORDER
[0:19:36] <$dudedude55555> pre-order memes
[0:19:37] <deafmutelaughing> does it count if I preorder it 5 minutes before it comes out just for the bonuses
[0:19:44] <majindusto> Asura's Wrath is still awesome..but yeah, that DLC Ending was Bullshit of Capcom to Do

[0:20:52] <%zanzibar_junker> Preordered new beast wars Dinobot
[0:20:53] <staple_boi> @lancaster_h Nothing is really safe on pc
[0:21:03] <+TheShisno> eBay 3090 pre-order paper certificate
[0:21:04] <%cache_22> DLCs chilled down once companies realized they can make Live Service / GaaS models.

[0:23:05] <Zayasu> @OblivionSword1 @digitalslime oh thanks.. finally BibleThump
[0:23:08] <majindusto> 3 is FIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE
[0:23:08] <leggojoseph> 3/28*
[0:23:08] <Lancaster_H> 3 was the best of times and the worst of times
[0:23:10] <+krispen_wa> remember when the main villain of yakuza 3 was a simp
[0:23:11] <Doctadaking> 3’s combat didnt age well. Everything else is solid
[0:23:12] <exnuart> judgement will come after stadia exclusivity
[0:23:17] <PanicSwytch> yup
[0:23:19] <%jinking79> 3 has Pat's Dad in it
[0:23:20] <Darren716> Kiwami 2 is way better than 3
[0:23:20] <notorious_rng> 2 is hard better than 3
[0:23:22] <SilverFaustX> kiwami 2 is the best
[0:23:24] <%cache_22> V loves Orphans
[0:23:25] <+krispen_wa> holy shit V has the worst taste
[0:23:26] <shieldecho> I really like 2
[0:23:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FACTS
[0:23:28] <andre11dr> I like 2 a lot
[0:23:29] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yakuza 2 is better than Yakuza 3
[0:23:31] <+NotHereToStream> 7 is great
[0:23:32] <notorious_rng> 2 > k2 > 3
[0:23:32] <therat_giant> 2 is good
[0:23:34] <leggojoseph> kiwami 2 slaps more than 1
[0:23:36] <OldManDeckardCain> FUCK OFF 2 IS GREAT
[0:23:37] <%Lion_kun> Kiwami 2 has Ryuji
[0:23:37] <SereneFox> No one will argue that 0 is best
[0:23:38] <downwiththethickness99> OG 1 and 2 are shit
[0:23:39] <dead_harmony13> 2 is great though
[0:23:42] <%velvetoctopuss> kiwami 2 fucking sucks lol
[0:23:42] <%LastHazzerd> 0 was made after 1-5
[0:23:43] <Solidnick18> 5 is long but i love it
[0:23:44] <Camail> 0 was like a watershed moment
[0:23:45] <majindusto> 3 has great Characters
[0:23:45] <alvaroeltz> Differentiate 2 and kiwami 2 people
[0:23:46] <staple_boi> 1 is great wtf
[0:23:46] <+gustavozxd> OG 1 is sick wtf
[0:23:46] <brachydios777> 3 has some pacing issues and the weaker one for me but it still has some really strong shit
[0:23:47] <+Zeroblazex> One has the worst ending boss fight in the world
[0:23:47] <+UltimortalMoth> Hello. Hope you all have a good day.
[0:23:49] <OokamiDen02> The closest of being as good as Zero would be 4
[0:23:49] <+TrevSmith222> Played 3 recently for the first time. It's great.
[0:23:49] <dead_harmony13> Boooo v
[0:23:49] <+TooManyGs> I feel like the weird one that has liked Kiwami 1 the best so far
[0:23:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KIWAMI 2 COMBAT SUCKS ASS
[0:23:54] <+Deko_> im having a hard time playing kiwami cause the cutscenes are so 1/1 to the ps2 ones they feel super dated
[0:23:55] <Felto3> the blocking in 3 ruined it
[0:23:56] <solracc25> 7 is the hobo squad
[0:23:57] <Jp_DrZaius> 2 its ok
[0:23:59] <downwiththethickness99> Kiwami and Kiwami 2 tho
[0:24:00] <%jinking79> Kiwami 2 makes fun of 3
[0:24:00] <smikeye> 1 and 2 OG are amazing
[0:24:02] <jamox1> Which one is the one with the Maijima everywhere system??
[0:24:04] <OblivionSword1> 3 is rough around the edges but it's still really good
[0:24:05] <+gustavozxd> OG 1 and 2 soundtrack are really unique
[0:24:05] <Camail> big agree
[0:24:05] <DSD24> 4 has good gameplay
[0:24:09] <OokamiDen02> 3 is awesome as well
[0:24:10] <a_tube_of_lube> 4 is just such a clusterfuck
[0:24:13] <Blank9> ps2 version of 2 is better than kiwami 2
[0:24:14] <digitalslime> 1&2 are much better then 3 from what i played
[0:24:15] <+Zeroblazex> The end of Yakuza One has the single most Unfun boss fight of the whole series
[0:24:15] <CappuccinoGuil> I have to start over Kiwami 2 because it was so rough that I forgot the plot
[0:24:19] <therat_giant> Kiwami 2's combat really isn't that fun
[0:24:25] <ZComiX> Yup 💯
[0:24:25] <%velvetoctopuss> og2 is vastly better than kiwami 2 imo
[0:24:26] <+Ancopro> 0 is the best version of 3 basically
[0:24:28] <%zanzibar_junker> 7 has sidequest chara from 2
[0:24:29] <%TooManyGs> whichever game has the most MAJIMA is the best one
[0:24:29] <$dudedude55555> secret koreans
[0:24:33] <Darren716> Shut up the castle is great
[0:24:36] <+Zeroblazex> Dragon engine is overrated
[0:24:41] <Jp_DrZaius> and Chinese Peoplr
[0:24:42] <chainsaw105> guess V is gonna hate 7 then
[0:24:45] <Lancaster_H> you dont like koreans V?
[0:24:45] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:24:46] <andre11dr> That's why 2 is great
[0:24:46] <%zanzibar_junker> Youll love 7 than
[0:24:48] <leggojoseph> What? yakuza being wierd and silly?
[0:24:48] <+BlueJoneleth> LittleV is gonna love 4 if he likes silly plots XD
[0:24:53] <%Lion_kun> 5 and 7 are the best ones.
[0:24:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:24:59] <CharlieDJohnson> 3 loses the plot as it goes on and 4 drove it off the cliff
[0:24:59] <%Drunkengen> SCERET KOREANS
[0:24:59] <%jinking79> originals 1&2 has the better OST
[0:25:00] <brachydios777> Story wise it’s 0, 2,3,1 so far for me
[0:25:02] <dylheim93> oh but it's still brilliant
[0:25:02] <+ThisIsLloyd> that's very interesting I'll have to retry 3 with what I know about it I had a kinda hard time with my playthrough
[0:25:04] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah 7 is best
[0:25:04] <majindusto> 2 IS AWESOME STILL
[0:25:05] <exnuart> i liked 2's conclusion
[0:25:06] <Solidnick18> when's ishin
[0:25:07] <%Juriasu> FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:25:07] <Doctadaking> 2 has a castle spit another castle
[0:25:08] <Darren716> She's 9 foot tall
[0:25:11] <+krispen_wa> CLIP IT
[0:25:13] <andre11dr> 7 is the silliest one by far
[0:25:14] <MyNameIsRasus> 2.9 METERS
[0:25:15] <%zanzibar_junker> 7 has great acting
[0:25:15] <brunoberserk> woolie , montreal mr libido
[0:25:16] <Darren716> With heels and hat
[0:25:16] <+krispen_wa> ISOLATE IT
[0:25:17] <Kaito_Cam> @WoolieVersus did you hear judgement is getting a remaster and coming to ps5 and xbox.
[0:25:19] <Blank9> ishin might legit be the best in the series still
[0:25:19] <+Ancopro> hat and heels included
[0:25:20] <downwiththethickness99> 9'6 BOIS
[0:25:21] <%Yung_Booker> Yung_Booker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:25:21] <Lancaster_H> BIGGER
[0:25:23] <OblivionSword1> or 2.9 meter
[0:25:23] <CappuccinoGuil> near 10 feet of POWER
[0:25:24] <%nintega010> She's as tall as Broly
[0:25:24] <%ThisIsLloyd> Kiwami 2 was very cool gameplay wise
[0:25:25] <+gustavozxd> @jinking79 yeah, it sucks that even though the later games have good ost, that style is gone from the franchise
[0:25:31] <Darren716> I'm more into the hat and design than the tallness
[0:25:32] <exnuart> internet horny
[0:25:36] <%Posh_Cat> 9ft 6”
[0:25:39] <+Zeroblazex> @kaito_cam yeah but the remaster ruined the art direction
[0:25:41] <+ZoltanBMagnus> LittleV isn't horny, oh no
[0:25:41] <+krispen_wa> SPIDER MAN?
[0:25:43] <+gustavozxd> Kiwami 2's gameplay is ok but boy is it easy
[0:25:43] <majindusto> God Dammit Sega...GIVE US ISHIN!!!
[0:25:43] <leggojoseph> awakened
[0:25:44] <masterfire23> doesn't woolie have a giantess thing
[0:25:44] <TYBGerritt> BOO THIS MAN
[0:25:45] <Lancaster_H> B I G G E R
[0:25:48] <Blank9> she's not cool until she does stuff as stupid as jack baker
[0:25:50] <shieldecho> I'm ace, I"m just happy other people are happy
[0:25:51] <andre11dr> That's like .9 more than me ,shit
[0:25:54] <brachydios777> Taller than mr x and Nemesis
[0:25:55] <+nevermorecake> YAY IT'S BACK ON :D
[0:25:56] <%Kaito_Cam> @Zeroblazex how it's the same game just at 4k60
[0:25:56] <Blank9> I want to see chainsaw duels
[0:25:58] <+gustavozxd> I beat the final boss with like 2 heat moves on hard atpRtsd
[0:25:58] <+mechslayer71> That shot when she opens the door and you see her wingspan Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:25:59] <%Posh_Cat> She wears that hat well
[0:26:08] <CharlieDJohnson> 7's plot is also incredibly stupid, increadibly incredibly stupid but it kinda wins you over anyway cause ichiban cares so much bout everything no matter how dumb stuff gets
[0:26:12] <%Juriasu> yes kiwami 2 will do that especially
[0:26:15] <+gustavozxd> DON'T GOOGLE CHARACTER NAMES
[0:26:17] <+gustavozxd> NEVER DO THAT
[0:26:19] <%BisoromiBear> what was your plan
[0:26:20] <CappuccinoGuil> DON'T look up Yakuza stuff before finishing
[0:26:28] <MyNameIsRasus> googles character name, first suggestion: "character name DEATH"
[0:26:29] <+Zeroblazex> @kaito_cam they redid a lot of the lighting and it’s already having problems with the models making them look worse
[0:26:29] <+Deko_> when you type a characters name and it autofills DEATH LUL
[0:26:31] <%Exiliator> That sounds pretty sad
[0:26:32] <time2getsweaty> so how do you guys feel about the direction that resident evil is taking by flipping the script and doing vampires? imo, im pretty hyped 9 foot lady aside.
[0:26:40] <%patriotrenegade> I thought he didnt matter because he died in the first hour
[0:26:45] <deafmutelaughing> let me look up their wiki page - "[character name] WAS"
[0:26:46] <%Seancicle> Jason Waterfalls situation here
[0:26:48] <+gustavozxd> even when a character doesn't die, the first thing that shows up is like "death" when you google their name
[0:26:49] <+mechslayer71> Woolie was right to not announce avatar until he was done
[0:26:50] <%Kaito_Cam> @Zeroblazex can you dm me a screenshop
[0:26:52] <benupde287> yakuza rules is wheel of time rules. stay off the wiki.
[0:26:53] <niddron> I don't watch AOT clips because I know some motherfucker will do the title spoiler
[0:26:54] <bufflb> does v like 3's combat? everyone is just blocking and being passive
[0:26:56] <therat_giant> @CharlieDJohnson this is the big one, I care about ichiban but I was kind of indifferent about the villain by the end. It worked really well even past that
[0:27:08] <SherlockianHero> I ruined the twist of SDR2 by doing that...
[0:27:09] <%Feralspirit41> I never read history books to avoid spoilers
[0:27:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @time2getsweaty RE has always done all sorts of monsters, so vampires and werewolves aren't that surprising
[0:27:13] <Blank9> yakuza barely has a functioning wiki
[0:27:14] <KohryuFR> IK wish you a merry christmas
[0:27:15] <Lancaster_H> dont go jason waterfalls BibleThump
[0:27:16] <+gustavozxd> republic commando is awesome
[0:27:24] <+krispen_wa> Little V: Shattered Memories
[0:27:25] <Darksolerino> Don't even google their names. I have googled character names and it autocompletes with "DEATH"
[0:27:27] <staple_boi> @gustavozxd The best
[0:27:27] <%Posh_Cat> For the record master chief was around 7.5ft
[0:27:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> Starwars Socom
[0:27:30] <X2Eliah> oh no not jason waterfalls
[0:27:31] <brachydios777> I think 0 and Kiwami 1 has the best combat
[0:27:35] <CalderGaming> modular guns
[0:27:38] <Cykron> It's a short perfect experience
[0:27:46] <+Ashaea> They used the Republic Commando music in swtor and I popped the fuck off when I heard it
[0:27:57] <%Posh_Cat> The haunted ship was cool in republic commando

[0:28:17] <+krispen_wa> @ashaea anytime mandos show up its the fucking coolest
[0:28:20] <majindusto> Nope
[0:28:28] <mister___doctor> That Omni guy has a 110 day streak
[0:28:34] <CharlieDJohnson> kiwami 1 is great for the combat yeah and while the story is kinda basic, at least the cutscenes get to the point quicker than later games

[0:46:18] <%dukenux> good evening, has Woolie unlocked the stonks minigame yet?
[0:46:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Woolie discovered a massive life hack
[0:46:26] <+Inverse_Girth> I’m pretty sure investigators have to rotate off cases and reviewing photos of CP and crime scenes bc it’s so damaging to the mind
[0:46:28] <Haarute> that's my favorite heat move lmao

[0:46:43] <%big_laser_boss> Lose to him once and take it all back with 69
[0:46:44] <%notsoy> yeah, the shakedown exploit relies on one of the CP bonuses, you earn 50% more money than he's shown as carrying
[0:46:48] <%Lion_kun> I literally hit the money limit in the game at 10 trillion.

[1:00:29] <Iniudan> You have to do 3 star on all difficulty for CP

[1:00:36] <therat_giant> do koi no disco queen, pretty please?
[1:00:40] <hazeprojekt> for side story leave club and come back in.
[1:00:42] <TheMoenia> you get three compo per song
[1:00:44] <%aram909> each one gives you an additional CP
[1:00:47] <+Trickyvic13> its honestly easier on hard cuz it matches all the beats
[1:00:47] <downwiththethickness99> You get 1 point for each challenge
[1:00:47] <+MileHighSalute88> Each difficulty has a CP
[1:00:48] <%aram909> each difficulty
[1:00:49] <+runegod20> There’s a separate point of CP for each difficulty
[1:00:52] <CharlieDJohnson> probably all of the songs are parodies but i can only tell for sure with im gonna make her mine, koi no disco queen and the bowie one
[1:00:54] <Zantetzuken> each level is +1

[1:08:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I'm a advocate for the idea that no Yakuza game needs a main plot crime drama. Let it all exists in a limbo with just the side quests and minigames like this
[1:08:25] <$dudedude55555> leave club
[1:08:30] <%doughvatkyn> does he have to leave?
[1:08:31] <rosemon5001> pepeClap
[1:08:41] <For_Temeria> Yakuza games could also just be crime dramas with more focused plots
[1:08:41] <user_naim> Leave and re-enter?
[1:08:44] <+Mendin> Leave, re-enter, and check the bar, apparently?

[1:18:34] <OldManDeckardCain> yeah, it's the worst
[1:18:36] <%doughvatkyn> mahjong yeyeye
[1:18:37] <For_Temeria> It's 1-4
[1:18:38] <Solidnick18> rip his anus
[1:18:39] <%Livelinne> woolieOMG
[1:18:40] <Blank9> ass destroyed
[1:18:43] <%Javaa01> And that's a fractured ass
[1:18:43] <Qu1ckyyy> Balls CRUSHED
[1:18:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah in Yakuza 3 they spawn in specific spots, they don’t roam
[1:18:55] <+gustavozxd> yeah that's how it was in 1 and 2
[1:18:57] <leith_aziz> 5 Kinda does it, but it's not as obtrusive
[1:18:58] <Halospaz117> That move is literally called "The Essence of Ass Crushing"
[1:18:58] <%aram909> yakuza 6 they skip out on all that and theres now no pause the battle starts absolutely immediately
[1:19:02] <LittleWulfie> I guess the talking-before-battle thing was to help with loading fights
[1:19:04] <glaciusinfinite> Kiryu's true rise to the title of dragon of dojima will start with business
[1:19:07] <+TrevSmith222> You got a tear-soaked Staminan X.
[1:19:09] <SilverFaustX> same with riots
[1:19:12] <+krispen_wa> REAL LIFE BEAST MODE
[1:19:13] <Pt_Kamen> just use the CP to get the stomach one and farm all the restaurants for lots of CP
[1:19:16] <%doughvatkyn> kiwami 2 has the best enemies and i think it's the same in 6
[1:19:18] <OldManDeckardCain> Essence of SHIT GETTING REAL
[1:19:23] <%doughvatkyn> they will chase you across town
[1:19:24] <downwiththethickness99> Fun fact you can charge the third punch in Beast mode and it launches enemies and you can follow up with Y
[1:19:31] <%dukenux> real life fights all bets are off
[1:19:33] <user_naim> The Yakuza 5 bike heat move where you drive it into the guy is my favorite
[1:19:34] <For_Temeria> Enemies would talk to you in Yakuza 1 and there would then be a loading screen
[1:19:41] <+RowenCleric> I wish all of life problems could be solved with street fghts...
[1:19:41] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @downwiththethickness99 HEY, DON'T STEAL MAH TIPS
[1:19:43] <ThatGuyThere03> So did Ice Cube do a heat move with that brick in Friday?

[1:20:10] <+Ancopro> or when a location isnt there and its like oh SHIT
[1:20:11] <+nevermorecake> V, what will it take to get you to do a cover of Hell Stew?? <3
[1:20:11] <X2Eliah> YES
[1:20:11] <leith_aziz> Yes
[1:20:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yes
[1:20:13] <Spagheddies> They absolutely do.
[1:20:13] <Solidnick18> yeah they do
[1:20:13] <Blank9> they do update it
[1:20:15] <KillMyPast> Yes they do
[1:20:17] <OldManDeckardCain> after playing a bunch of yakuza games, kamurocho is a second (virtual) home
[1:20:17] <TheMoenia> i was so sad that the don quijote is not here in yakuza 7
[1:20:21] <For_Temeria> They're inconsistent
[1:20:23] <leith_aziz> I love that about Kamurocho
[1:20:24] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes!!!
[1:20:28] <+runegod20> It feels nice to play a new yakuza over time and have it all come back to you
[1:20:29] <+Player1DFB> Cafe Alps is in Yakuza 7
[1:20:30] <+Awkward_Cyborg> they update pretty much everything
[1:20:32] <Solidnick18> they update it by time period
[1:20:32] <+Player1DFB> spoiler alert
[1:20:32] <OblivionSword1> yeah they update the map every entries
[1:20:34] <+krispen_wa> it's a Yakuza business
[1:20:34] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Nope, cafe alps is still around in Judgement.
[1:20:34] <For_Temeria> Cafe Alps and Akaushimaru are there in every game
[1:20:37] <%doughvatkyn> sorry i was late, best buddy oda
[1:20:39] <+TrevSmith222> Kamurocho gets cleaner with every game.
[1:20:41] <+Trickyvic13> after 0 there is no shrine so i guess no one is religious anymore lol
[1:20:44] <SherlockianHero> YEAH COOL GUY ODA
[1:20:45] <+coldsama> But apparently everything happens on Tenkaichi Street and the children park
[1:20:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> You're one to talk pal
[1:20:46] <%Lion_kun> Cafe Alps is in all of them.
[1:20:47] <+BloodyBurney> game is bit quiet, or its it just me?
[1:20:48] <SilverFaustX> he looks kinda like akiyama
[1:20:50] <TenpennyBlue> don quijote turns into the eye of sauron in Yakuza 7
[1:20:51] <For_Temeria> Worst boy Oda
[1:20:56] <+IJspegels> There's a whole subplot in Yakuza 5 about Café Alps struggeling to stay in buisiness after all that time
[1:20:56] <shieldecho> I played 4 first; there's a takeout place in 2 that I remembered being an ice cream shop in 4
[1:20:57] <$hattrick61> Oda-chan
[1:20:59] <+KPlanet__Live> most of south kamurocho is identical from zero to 3, only the north end changes, with millienium tower, and the construction site and such
[1:21:00] <+Player1DFB> @Trickyvic13 religion died in the 80's...that's deep
[1:21:07] <leith_aziz> The pants don't mesh well, my opinion
[1:21:10] <downwiththethickness99> In 3, Gindaco Highball is replaced by a Gelato/Ice Cream shop

[1:22:50] <+krispen_wa> @r0chelimit well in japan it's just Like a Dragon, and Kiryu spends 100% of the time as a Dragon
[1:22:58] <leith_aziz> This is probably the only part of the game that feels like it drags in later playthroughs, otherwise the pacing is perfect

[1:23:14] <For_Temeria> Kiryu's in the yakuza for a total of 2 hours in the entire series, that's why it's not called Yakuza
[1:23:15] <%doughvatkyn> yakuza 1 is 99% scams
[1:23:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Scams? In MY Yakuza game?
[1:23:22] <SherlockianHero> Looks like Kiryu is Reaching out for the Truth.
[1:23:26] <X2Eliah> "Squatlord" sounds like a russian street punk
[1:23:27] <twoto858> Gotta wait til Yakuza Kiwami 2 for that minigame
[1:23:33] <%doughvatkyn> kiryu turns a corner--SCAM
[1:23:35] <leggojoseph> scams in this economy?
[1:23:42] <%gatorafan> @doughvatkyn the other 1% is Hustle
[1:24:02] <X2Eliah> Why do they bother running these scams if they can just beat up a few guys on the street and get millions
[1:24:04] <hazeprojekt> Scams in any major city?
[1:24:06] <%doughvatkyn> and even then it's hustlint scammers

[1:30:51] <+TheShisno> So if real estate is the Business Universe of 0, what does every other game have, chat?
[1:31:13] <alvaroeltz> good thing that the main story of yakuza 0 ends right after this scene, and the real game can begin
[1:31:13] <%dukenux> Kiryu's brain can't fathom not solving problems with violence
[1:31:15] <%notsoy> the "business dimension" is mostly only in more recent games
[1:31:21] <For_Temeria> Kiwami 2 recycles the business universe, 6 and K2 have the Kiryu clan universe
[1:31:22] <%dukenux> oof
[1:31:27] <Solidnick18> yep that is him

[2:05:14] <+runegod20> cornering is apparently how stable you are while moving on a corner while there's a seperate inviisble stat for how fast you go on corners, which is confusing
[2:05:15] <Solidnick18> well whatever
[2:05:23] <coreyyotto> you can't really use it for the early races anyways because the of the cost limits
[2:05:27] <%aram909> the problem is that with some tracks you cant use some of the high end parts, not just because of the cost but if you go too fast you lose handling a lot easier
[2:05:27] <%doomerskeletor13> I’ll be honest I used a guide for this lmao
[2:05:27] <%Livelinne> KappaPride
[2:05:28] <Monkeyking966> hey lil v let him take all of the stuff from Bob

[2:15:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Rest of the stream baaaaby
[2:15:51] <%Javaa01> This IS the main plotline of the series
[2:15:52] <Clundy> The sound of the cars on the track give me instant nostalgia. You remember the faint electric fire smell they would give off?
[2:15:54] <LVL1_Scumbag> ye

[2:16:44] <RyuShinden> @WoolieVersus You can test a track if you want
[2:16:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah I think leaving resets their parts
[2:16:46] <KaitlynnHere> Watch out god
[2:16:51] <Blank9> parts have hidden stats sometimes too
[2:16:51] <KaitlynnHere> Here comes Woolie
[2:16:53] <Equirah> Better grip!
[2:16:53] <Spagheddies> Low profile tend to be good for tracks with a lot of jumps.
[2:16:54] <%dukenux> Gotta get a grip
[2:17:04] <morningmoondude> oh hell yeah!
[2:17:16] <%big_laser_boss> READ THE DESCRIPTION
[2:17:19] <+runegod20> ah, so grip is suppose be for jumps then
[2:17:20] <%doughvatkyn> can't wait for kiryu to meet racer x
[2:17:26] <astrophizz> check the track layout
[2:17:29] <%aram909> soft
[2:17:37] <Kiryurules> GRAP
[2:17:44] <exnuart> grip is used for grass
[2:17:44] <chainsaw105> soft and wet
[2:17:53] <RyuShinden> @WoolieVersus Check the track
[2:17:53] <+Adriangabs> wow this takes me back
[2:17:56] <KaitlynnHere> And warm
[2:18:00] <%big_laser_boss> There are special properties to each part not listed in the stats
[2:18:01] <+runegod20> damn, this is the third track and it's already a 12 lap race
[2:18:02] <MyNameIsRasus> GORILLA GRAP
[2:18:07] <Spagheddies> Oh man, this track.
[2:18:08] <DSD24> The GRAP

[2:18:41] <%aram909> too heavy
[2:18:41] <Kiryurules> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:18:43] <%ChoculaUltra> BIG YABAI
[2:18:43] <%aram909> take out the stabilizer
[2:18:44] <%dukenux> :(
[2:18:44] <MechNexus> MORTIS
[2:18:45] <RyuShinden> D:
[2:18:46] <gasperbpuffn> DAME DA NE
[2:18:47] <+Ancopro> this course is the newb KILLEr
[2:18:47] <majindusto> TOO MUCH GRAP
[2:18:48] <digitalslime> so sad
[2:18:50] <alvaroeltz> killed a kid with the car
[2:18:50] <AngryAsian5> T H I C C
[2:18:52] <Blank9> heavy, but also too much speed
[2:18:52] <%dukenux> Gorilla Grip
[2:18:53] <brunoberserk> HEAVY DAZE
[2:18:53] <%doughvatkyn> sparks exploding off of the heavy car
[2:18:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you fed it TOO MUCH
[2:18:54] <BabblingBayou> Too dang THICC
[2:18:54] <feralspidey> too thicc
[2:18:56] <KaitlynnHere> Wow
[2:18:57] <RyuShinden> @WoolieVersus Test the track first
[2:18:57] <astrophizz> your build is really unbalanced
[2:18:57] <LVL1_Scumbag> You fuck with God, God fucks with you.
[2:18:58] <%gatorafan> fat rolls
[2:18:58] <%wibbwobbler> i don't get it
[2:19:00] <morningmoondude> That was terrible, better cut off a pinky for that
[2:19:04] <+MileHighSalute88> Too heavy
[2:19:04] <%MrPedrovsky> GORILLA GRIP BUSSY
[2:19:06] <X2Eliah> THAT IS NOT HOW GRIP WORKS
[2:19:06] <+Stormiercashew> Essence of GIRTH
[2:19:10] <chainsaw105> that car flew off the track and killed that dude in the empty lot
[2:19:16] <+Idziman> how are you supposed to drift with all that grap?
[2:19:17] <%big_laser_boss> Read the description and check the track
[2:19:22] <feralspidey> only $5
[2:19:23] <Brickston> oh we into the real game now?
[2:19:26] <TheMoenia> stabilizer is way to heavy
[2:19:26] <+gustavozxd> but what if you need those 500 yen later
[2:19:29] <%wibbwobbler> more grip is bad??
[2:19:30] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus It's faster to get it down on test drive and win once over doing this shit over and over.
[2:19:30] <+runegod20> one or two random street fights are enough to for a lifetime of pocket circuit fights
[2:19:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> remove the stabilizer
[2:19:31] <astrophizz> check the frames
[2:19:35] <%aram909> remove the stabilizer
[2:19:35] <Brickston> Yakuza 0 is mostly filler surrounding the main event: slot car racing
[2:19:36] <%aram909> too heavy
[2:19:41] <%doughvatkyn> sometimes the courae descriptions just lie
[2:19:42] <astrophizz> stabilizer is super heavy
[2:19:48] <jaygee303> Pretty sure if you walk away from the shop they announce new parts are in
[2:19:52] <Kiryurules> I BELIEBE
[2:19:54] <whimsicallifestyle> pocket circuit is a learning experience
[2:19:56] <+Ancopro> sorry oda i couldnt afford the confections no reason
[2:20:07] <+Balkespower> DAMN THAT JUMP
[2:20:09] <+runegod20> there are a ton of corners so it makes sense, but i feel like are corners are good enough already
[2:20:11] <KeiPrime> use the boost to get thru
[2:20:11] <lovesosa236> this is most kiryu has shown emotion
[2:20:19] <Kiryurules> Kiryu is a sports addict
[2:20:20] <whimsicallifestyle> odas like the where is that guy
[2:20:22] <Spagheddies> RPM
[2:20:25] <+Balkespower> LMAO
[2:20:25] <Josef_Stryker> BibleThump
[2:20:28] <exnuart> stuck on the corner
[2:20:29] <Kiryurules> BibleThump
[2:20:29] <Spagheddies> You were missing RPM
[2:20:30] <%ChoculaUltra> tooooo stable
[2:20:31] <X2Eliah> too slow uphill
[2:20:34] <Vyneci> Yeah that's what's happening LUL
[2:20:34] <X2Eliah> too heavy
[2:20:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> !uptime
[2:20:38] <feralspidey> T O O T H I C C K~~~!!
[2:20:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 20 minutes
[2:20:41] <X2Eliah> engine is not on
[2:20:41] <%sillyschlub> BibleThump BibleThump
[2:20:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> Get out and go back in to refresh the shop for more parts, I think
[2:20:45] <astrophizz> also check your frame
[2:20:45] <RyuShinden> Maybe too heavy
[2:20:45] <%aram909> yeah get the godspeed motor
[2:20:48] <+MileHighSalute88> Heavy
[2:20:49] <%big_laser_boss> godspeed godspeed godspeed
[2:20:51] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Dude stop using Godspeed, it's not meant for low level races.
[2:20:53] <%doughvatkyn> feed the car money
[2:21:04] <Brickston> in b4 flies off the track
[2:21:05] <+Mendin> Yeah leave and return to refresh shop inventory now that you've cleared some races
[2:21:12] <silent_tim47> Hey Woolie, are you gonna play the other Yakuza games?
[2:21:12] <feralspidey> you may have to downgrade
[2:21:12] <X2Eliah> TRY IT
[2:21:13] <TheMoenia> dont forget the fram
[2:21:13] <1v1GE> Cornering sucks, change Frame!
[2:21:18] <%gatorafan> No, this kids must learn
[2:21:22] <%big_laser_boss> frame
[2:21:25] <rafflespaddock> tires will become important later
[2:21:26] <astrophizz> frame
[2:21:29] <Brickston> Iyaaaaa!
[2:21:32] <1v1GE> maybe change frame to metal
[2:21:49] <Kiryurules> Slow start, high speed
[2:22:00] <Brickston> ooowaaaaaagh!
[2:22:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:04] <+runegod20> did we change the battery at all?
[2:22:04] <Josef_Stryker> Save the boost for the final lap
[2:22:07] <%big_laser_boss> frame
[2:22:09] <%aram909> you have to be aggressive with the B tapping
[2:22:11] <%doughvatkyn> y e e t
[2:22:12] <astrophizz> switch the battery and frame
[2:22:13] <MyNameIsRasus> i think the frame is fucking you over
[2:22:18] <%ChoculaUltra> that look on Kiryu's face is so heart breaking FeelsBadMan
[2:22:19] <%MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus FORGOT BATTERY
[2:22:22] <HeadwearHijacker> high cap batt may solve the problem
[2:22:23] <Spagheddies> Long Duration Batteries, for 12 laps, are fucking essential.
[2:22:24] <RyuShinden> Yea, no boosts for now. It has many laps anyway
[2:22:27] <%big_laser_boss> battery and frame
[2:22:28] <%jepupu> Acceleration is pretty low, and acceleration is what gets you uphill
[2:22:31] <+aram909> you need a better battery
[2:22:38] <+runegod20> alot of laps on a race with a big track too
[2:22:39] <morningmoondude> What would Hijiyama do?
[2:22:41] <dead_harmony13> Switch out battery
[2:22:43] <enerkaizer> man, anyone remember Crush Gear? that was pretty much pocket circuit racing as real toys
[2:22:43] <%Lion_kun> Never boost unless you have to.
[2:22:50] <%doughvatkyn> if you boost, boost at the end
[2:22:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> Go Out and in, refresh the shop
[2:22:55] <astrophizz> frame and battery...
[2:22:55] <TheMoenia> forgot the frame again
[2:22:56] <whimsicallifestyle> wait it out
[2:23:03] <Kiryurules> Play it patient
[2:23:18] <RyuShinden> @enerkaizer Crush Gear is basically poclet Racers, but cars slamming each other instead of racing.
[2:23:24] <Kiryurules> D:
[2:23:28] <%aram909> you need to be aggressive with the B tapping
[2:23:29] <+Tucker0603> frame
[2:23:29] <KillMyPast> Too much speed
[2:23:37] <%doughvatkyn> that car hates being on the track
[2:23:37] <AngryAsian5> The pain on Kiryu's face is so palpable
[2:23:38] <%notsoy> check the parts shop again
[2:23:39] <Brickston> god motor is overkill
[2:23:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> GET MORE PARTS
[2:23:40] <$eco419> F
[2:23:40] <1v1GE> frame and battery
[2:23:48] <TheMoenia> it can run out
[2:23:49] <exnuart> you can run out
[2:23:50] <%big_laser_boss> no
[2:23:51] <astrophizz> you will run out
[2:23:53] <CappuccinoGuil> You can super run out
[2:23:53] <fIashman92> It runs out
[2:23:55] <%McSoliace> you can run out of juice
[2:23:55] <MyNameIsRasus> you can super run out
[2:23:59] <Spagheddies> Batteries loose power as time goes on.
[2:23:59] <KillMyPast> You will run out and slow down towards the end
[2:24:00] <exnuart> you will slow to a stop
[2:24:00] <turbofolk> YES YOU CAN RUN OUT
[2:24:00] <%big_laser_boss> you can run out
[2:24:02] <+runegod20> without that massive weight, you can pick a slower car and still do good
[2:24:03] <Blank9> rubber frame
[2:24:07] <CappuccinoGuil> This jam is good
[2:24:09] <%aram909> rubber frame
[2:24:11] <%doughvatkyn> i mean it's a battery for a reason
[2:24:11] <fIashman92> Read the frame descriptions
[2:24:14] <1v1GE> Read what it does, don't just look at numbers!
[2:24:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> REEE GET MORE PARTS
[2:24:17] <coreyyotto> Compare Kiryu's facial expression in that one second cutaway to the entireity of The Medium
[2:24:22] <Spagheddies> I don't think you can "run out" of battery, but you can absolutely lose a ton of speed.
[2:24:27] <OldManDeckardCain> boosting at the right time is only necessary in the hardest races, like for example that one battle with "an old friend" in kiwami TehePelo
[2:24:31] <1v1GE> READ DESCRiPTIONS, NOT JUST NUMBERS
[2:24:32] <Blank9> the numbers can lie, you want to trust descriptions more
[2:24:38] <+runegod20> metal frame is literally the same as the stablizer with low weight, damn
[2:24:41] <%big_laser_boss> use it with the stabilizer
[2:24:43] <%doughvatkyn> feed. the. car. money.
[2:24:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> High cornering is more stable but slower
[2:24:46] <astrophizz> the descriptions mean more than the stats
[2:24:47] <+Tucker0603> stability I think?
[2:24:48] <Brickston> improves cornering SPEED
[2:24:50] <TheMoenia> improves cornering SPEED
[2:24:50] <+runegod20> cornering stat is conrering stablity, cornering speed is an invisible stat
[2:24:56] <%aram909> no, you want more stability
[2:24:57] <Brickston> jynx
[2:25:04] <coreyyotto> Go faster through corners but at greater risk of flying off the track
[2:25:05] <jaygee303> You can get more parts if you leave the shop
[2:25:07] <%aram909> because there are lots of corners in this track
[2:25:15] <+Balkespower> High Capacity
[2:25:20] <Brickston> we flyin' boys
[2:25:27] <%aram909> bullet car
[2:25:27] <%notsoy> the cornering stat shown is stability
[2:25:27] <%gatorafan> universe is going places
[2:25:34] <DSD24> I like that blue guy
[2:25:38] <LVL1_Scumbag> I believe I can fly
[2:25:42] <%doughvatkyn> are you really a pocket racer if you haven't spent a billion on it?
[2:25:46] <%MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus Re-enter for more parts
[2:25:46] <Halospaz117> Sick grind bro
[2:25:47] <Kiryurules> Way too much juice
[2:25:50] <+Balkespower> GodSpeed is overkill
[2:25:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> get more parts
[2:25:58] <Brickston> Kiryu's car smashes into some kid's face watching the race
[2:25:58] <turbofolk> the frame is too shit
[2:25:59] <+Balkespower> *Godspeed engine
[2:26:00] <%aram909> no its not the motor, swap the frame for more cornering
[2:26:02] <OldManDeckardCain> PUT UP THE SHIELD WOOLIE
[2:26:05] <astrophizz> it's too imbalanced
[2:26:06] <BlackermanZX> My car doodTerror
[2:26:08] <Vyneci> Walk away from the fighter and it refreshes
[2:26:10] <%big_laser_boss> stabilizer with rocket frame is a good combination
[2:26:12] <TheMoenia> too much cornering SPEED too little cornering STABILITY
[2:26:16] <R3c0n31> too much POWER, AntiVergal Tech
[2:26:18] <alvaroeltz> If you complete a cup and walk out
[2:26:18] <%gatorafan> turns out God can't be trusted Kappa
[2:26:21] <%doughvatkyn> swap to the uchi
[2:26:23] <%aram909> you need the cornering number to go up, thats the cornering stability
[2:26:25] <jaygee303> Give it a go
[2:26:27] <chainsaw105> I really appreciate that you can't just slap the best stuff on and stomp every race
[2:26:27] <+Goku01899> do they have the side stabilizers?
[2:26:32] <+runegod20> metal frame seemed perfect
[2:26:32] <RyuShinden> Restock
[2:26:40] <syanplague> There a motor called High Torque motor mark II
[2:26:41] <TheRiverNyx> Every one of these out of lane cars murders a person in the crowd
[2:26:42] <RyuShinden> Oh shit! Restock! LUL
[2:26:42] <jasonisgold79> New Parts, time to spend our life saving to fuel our Pocket Circut hobby!
[2:26:43] <%aram909> rubber frame is best, 99 cornering
[2:26:48] <syanplague> is ideal for this
[2:26:50] <%aram909> and only 1 gram heavier
[2:26:53] <KeiPrime> time to Trim the Marks
[2:26:59] <Brickston> @TheRiverNyx all the people standing around watching have bruised shins
[2:27:03] <+Balkespower> Be sure to buy the car from the pawn shop for a bumber plate, Woolie.
[2:27:04] <Iniudan> $100 each part =p
[2:27:04] <syanplague> you get on a secret shop
[2:27:05] <RyuShinden> WHALING
[2:27:18] <syanplague> after you complete a side story
[2:27:21] <Josef_Stryker> Remember how Kiryu had to help prove his innocence to save his adoptive father? Kappa
[2:27:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Free CP
[2:27:24] <+duichenko> how long has it been since he started the pocket racing arc?
[2:27:26] <+Grim1952> Oh boy, the pocket racer arc
[2:27:29] <%doughvatkyn> buy some warhammer 40k figures too woolie
[2:27:30] <jaygee303> It’s like leaving a card shop and they unveil an exodia lathered in gold
[2:27:30] <Solidnick18> oh hey a shiny on the floor
[2:27:31] <Brickston> free captain picard?
[2:27:34] <+runegod20> we've already only spent 2000$ worth of money
[2:27:39] <Kiryurules> The manga has transitioned into a sports story
[2:27:41] <OldManDeckardCain> I can't believe powercreep is ruining pocket racing Kappa
[2:27:43] <R3c0n31> Whaling is fun when it aint your money
[2:27:45] <majindusto> SPARKLE on THE GROUND
[2:27:56] <turbofolk> bye V
[2:28:02] <%doughvatkyn> get some new metal dics sets
[2:28:04] <%wibbwobbler> v
[2:28:05] <+Balkespower> Power Motor
[2:28:08] <Brickston> Kiryu spending money he got beating people up to beat children at pocket racing Kappa
[2:28:10] <%doughvatkyn> dice*
[2:28:17] <jasonisgold79> I mean we just spent like.....20,000 yen for a children's racing game, it's fine.
[2:28:17] <turbofolk> your frame is too shit Woolie
[2:28:21] <coreyyotto> Try out Extra Balanced?
[2:28:23] <+Balkespower> you need accel to climb the walls
[2:28:23] <RyuShinden> Go for power
[2:28:26] <alvaroeltz> remember for the future, pocket circuit is for kids, because the price of those parts, oh man
[2:28:33] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @WillyFresh992
[2:28:33] <Equirah> POWAH
[2:28:39] <TheMoenia> you need more cornering stability, you keep flying out
[2:28:39] <Brickston> Sorry kid, maybe you should go beat up Mr Shakedown if you want to stand a chance
[2:28:42] <+Grim1952> Check out the layout of the race, you might need more torque
[2:28:44] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> TitaniumDragoonNeo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! WE BLOODBORNE CART NOW, BOYS! LET'S GO!!!
[2:28:44] <X2Eliah> acceleration is terrible tho
[2:28:50] <+runegod20> expensive ain't always better
[2:29:03] <+Balkespower> Metal frame
[2:29:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:29:04] <%big_laser_boss> you need torque for these slopes
[2:29:08] <Spagheddies> Torque is what determines how effectively you can go up laps, not acceleration.
[2:29:09] <BlackermanZX> only the rich kid can win the race
[2:29:12] <fIashman92> I always found the metal frames to be the best
[2:29:18] <%aram909> rubber frame plus
[2:29:20] <+Grim1952> It's deeper than it look
[2:29:26] <%doughvatkyn> @brickston god a good mr shakedown idea would be a guy trying to buy all the pocket racer parts
[2:29:29] <+Goku01899> metal frame is the best
[2:29:39] <+Balkespower> Godspeed Gears are good
[2:29:44] <%gatorafan> Chat is about the enter the Frame Wars
[2:29:46] <+runegod20> damn our speed is so low without the god speed
[2:29:47] <Spagheddies> 11 speed though.
[2:29:48] <%aram909> keep the godspeed gears
[2:29:52] <jaygee303> Balanced frame is god tier
[2:29:52] <%big_laser_boss> a lot of slopes
[2:29:56] <WillyFresh992> Sorry kids old man Kiryu bought all the new parts
[2:30:14] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Gotta get the Drag-On model.
[2:30:16] <+Balkespower> NO side stabilisiers here

[2:31:30] <+runegod20> after those hell death corners always seem like the best point to boost
[2:31:38] <jaygee303> Not for 12 laps tho
[2:31:38] <%ChoculaUltra> Yusuke monkaS
[2:31:40] <+Grim1952> It's going to be close
[2:31:41] <coreyyotto> Cars that seem fast will often die out later in the race though
[2:31:46] <+runegod20> especially when you're not in the inner part of the corner, that's always a death crap
[2:31:46] <Kiryurules> I BELIEVE
[2:31:48] <+egalitarian696969> the tortoise and the hare rip
[2:31:52] <Brickston> not enough torque to get up those hills

[2:32:53] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus The more you boost the more it expends your car's battery.
[2:32:54] <%AMUSERNAME> Get this man a High Torque Motor LUL
[2:32:54] <%jepupu> You lose a lot of speed in the slopes

[2:44:03] <%Lion_kun> Or just buy a zap gun
[2:44:06] <%doughvatkyn> put the stabilizer back on
[2:44:07] <linSP> is that a GUN
[2:44:07] <%doomerskeletor13> I wish one of the Shakedowns was just doing it so he could play Pocket Circuit
[2:44:11] <mothmanandthesalmon> Get drunk and crush him with yr BALLZ
[2:44:16] <+runegod20> ooo, does quick change work with switching off a weapon?
[2:44:24] <%ekodrop> it's like woolie forgot how to fight these guys
[2:44:26] <+Tucker0603> USE RUSH
[2:44:32] <%big_laser_boss> @astrophizz The tiger-drop is not in this game
[2:44:37] <For_Temeria> Nah brawler is good
[2:44:47] <KillMyPast> Brawler has a weaker version of Tiger Drop
[2:44:48] <+noajenkk> rush is the move for shakedown imo
[2:45:03] <For_Temeria> Brawler kills him faster
[2:45:13] <%big_laser_boss> @tucker0603 Quick-change clothes
[2:45:13] <syanplague> @big_laser_boss there is a tiger drop like in brawler
[2:45:14] <%doughvatkyn> brawler worked well against him for me
[2:45:18] <+Stupid121v2> Yakuza 3 has aged lmao
[2:45:18] <Hyde_01> business card also heals you
[2:45:24] <coreyyotto> I dunno I still prefer Kiryu's Dragon moveset better
[2:45:25] <+noajenkk> i love yakuza 3
[2:45:32] <%r0chelimit> Don't forget that in Rush, the grab button turns into a guard break
[2:45:32] <X2Eliah> At this rate Woolie will run out of heals
[2:45:34] <+Stupid121v2> but its also my favorite one
[2:45:36] <%doughvatkyn> it has a dodge but it isn't as good
[2:45:41] <joshua_42> The story for Y3 is great but the gameplay is one of the weaker parts
[2:45:41] <+Trickyvic13> brawler also kills you faster lol
[2:45:42] <%big_laser_boss> @killmypast WAY slower
[2:45:48] <TheMoenia> after yakuza 1 its dragon of dojima only i think
[2:45:53] <%big_laser_boss> weaker I mean
[2:45:53] <+runegod20> dodge got good heat building stuff but I think alot of it is in the move trainer
[2:45:56] <%AMUSERNAME> I'm sure it's just rust, but locking on makes these fights way more reasonable
[2:45:58] <+Goku01899> He's free to beast if there are bikes around
[2:45:59] <X2Eliah> This is the problem with pocket racer, it really rusts you up
[2:46:13] <chainsaw105> the weapon that really fucks him up is the zap gun so just stocking up like 3 of those will do you good
[2:46:15] <For_Temeria> Brawler finishers don't have that much end lag, you can just quickstep and be fine
[2:46:15] <Solidnick18> it's very good damage
[2:46:15] <Karego_at> woolie is keeping such a big distance, get closer!!
[2:46:15] <+noajenkk> heat action has i frames on startup pog
[2:46:18] <+Trickyvic13> shattered
[2:46:18] <+Crippl3> lmao
[2:46:20] <Kiryurules> D:
[2:46:23] <X2Eliah> Yeah that's a broken shin
[2:46:23] <+runegod20> that's probably a heavy bowling ball too
[2:46:25] <%r0chelimit> Tazer does
[2:46:26] <Solidnick18> oh my ankle
[2:46:32] <glaciusinfinite> it do
[2:46:33] <syanplague> It has
[2:46:35] <+runegod20> I think fan actually does have one but I don't think it does against shake down?
[2:46:35] <Spagheddies> Swords usually don't have heatmoves.
[2:46:36] <%doughvatkyn> i kinda wish the bowling heat move used pin sfx
[2:46:40] <+Stupid121v2> turned him into the spongebob leg guy
[2:46:42] <glaciusinfinite> I fun one too
[2:46:46] <Solidnick18> OH
[2:46:46] <OokamiDen02> tazer is fun
[2:46:52] <X2Eliah> rip
[2:46:55] <Haarute> is the sacrificial stone equiped?
[2:47:03] <%Lion_kun> A zapgun would finish this in seconds.
[2:47:15] <+noajenkk> shoutout to slime gun
[2:47:15] <+Stupid121v2> love how they go fish mode
[2:47:19] <%r0chelimit> MARLIN CANNON
[2:47:19] <OokamiDen02> the flop
[2:47:32] <%doughvatkyn> yeah that stungun move would kill a guy but fortunately it's rubber electricity
[2:47:34] <+Crippl3> there's still ENVIRONMETNAL WEAPONS
[2:47:36] <+runegod20> there's still street stuff for what it's worth
[2:47:41] <For_Temeria> If you quickstep to dodge his moves, you can capitalize on his recovery :)
[2:47:51] <+noajenkk> bro just dodge lol 4Head
[2:47:55] <gildedlegacy0117> This boss Regens health it looks like.
[2:48:04] <coreyyotto> I don't think it matters if you rotate heat moves, they always get weaker as you use more of them on the same enemy.
[2:48:05] <For_Temeria> no he doesn't
[2:48:14] <+noajenkk> yeah heat moves stale
[2:48:20] <+noajenkk> regardless
[2:48:30] <whimsicallifestyle> shit
[2:48:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> Puny Kiryu
[2:48:37] <+runegod20> oh right, we brought the wake up heat move for brawler for what it's worth
[2:48:38] <$StaceMcGate> Woolie is just doing the safest and biggest cowardice strategy of fighting, which means slow progress
[2:48:43] <jasonisgold79> I don't know if it's his type of game, but has Woolie checked out Friday Night Funkin yet? If not for the game or art, at least for the music. Because the music in it is pretty dope.
[2:49:18] <%r0chelimit> Did woolie ever get the Heat move in rush style that is the counter against the wall?
[2:49:19] <Spagheddies> Ideally, environmental weapons would be for the best now.
[2:49:24] <%doughvatkyn> honestly learning mr shakedown with rush is pretty good
[2:49:27] <+runegod20> oh right, I think he did get that
[2:49:36] <syanplague> @r0chelimit He got
[2:49:41] <For_Temeria> Kiryu runs a mile every time he fights Mr. Shakedown
[2:49:54] <+Rivalsz> motion sickness woo
[2:49:54] <jasonisgold79> Just play it safe.
[2:49:59] <%r0chelimit> could be useful
[2:50:00] <%doughvatkyn> then he can learn beast and brawler's ways of doing it
[2:50:03] <OblivionSword1> last health bar LET'S GO
[2:50:04] <+Trickyvic13> thats why woolie is a heart throb V
[2:50:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:50:08] <%Kaito_Cam> I find it interesting how wollie isn't taking the slime gun way out
[2:50:25] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:50:34] <gildedlegacy0117> Ah bosses have multiple HP bars. Got it
[2:50:36] <+runegod20> it's such a meaty thud sound too
[2:50:44] <%Juriasu> Rush style gets faster the more heat you have, I usually prefer not even bothering with heat moves with Kiryu
[2:50:53] <%Kaito_Cam> Anyone ever got the razor scooter to the leg.
[2:50:58] <%Kaito_Cam> shit fucking sucks.
[2:50:59] <KillMyPast> We need that big boy Brawler damage
[2:51:02] <+Rivalsz> hitting your shin is something everyone can relate to especially since its bone
[2:51:10] <+threeheadedwalrus> @Kaito_Cam all the damn time
[2:51:21] <%doughvatkyn> mr shakedown can take a lot of broken knees
[2:51:30] <PerfidiousSinn> was anyone else too much of a coward to fight Shakedown until postgame?
[2:51:38] <%doughvatkyn> kiryu may run out of bowling balls tho
[2:51:49] <OblivionSword1> almost there
[2:52:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS BEEN 84 YEAR
[2:52:03] <jasonisgold79> So if Woolie decided to try the other games later on, would that mean he would play the Fist of the North Star game at some point? It was made by the Yakuza Devs, and plays similar to them.
[2:52:04] <Solidnick18> it does take him awhile to get up tho
[2:52:08] <For_Temeria> First run I was a coward, but on my second playthrough I bullied him to buy every upgrade by chapter 7
[2:52:14] <%big_laser_boss> You can dogs outside attack range and still get heat in rush
[2:52:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @solidnick18 Thats what,she,said
[2:52:25] <+runegod20> man, the finishing blow after a single hit does more damage than a full rush combo
[2:52:25] <vincerocmm> 3
[2:52:28] <vincerocmm> 2
[2:52:29] <jasonisgold79> Even has Kiryus VA voice Kenshiro in it.
[2:52:30] <vincerocmm> 1
[2:52:31] <+noajenkk> BIG MONEY
[2:52:33] <PerfidiousSinn> I wouldn't wish that FOTNS game on my worst enemy LUL
[2:52:34] <Solidnick18> @BallerSwagBro9k SeriousSloth
[2:52:36] <$StaceMcGate> @jasonisgold79 seeing as we are month 4 of this LP and still chapter 5, best not to look that forward into the future lol
[2:52:37] <+infernophoenix99> I remember farming trillions off of shakedown, it was a fun time but way too much overkill
[2:52:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's how it's done
[2:52:45] <su6human> has Woolie done the rush wall heatmove on him?
[2:52:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah that Hokuto game is pretty bad
[2:52:58] <jasonisgold79> @jasonisgold79 True. These games are long.
[2:53:00] <chainsaw105> just get zap guns and it becomes easy peasy
[2:53:04] <%doughvatkyn> i farmed mr shakedown early but it was s l o w
[2:53:04] <prime_name> Is he an M?
[2:53:06] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes will help you style on him
[2:53:13] <arkv01> ur NOT MY MOM!!
[2:53:14] <+noajenkk> the hnk game is fine
[2:53:23] <feralspidey> wooliePOYO "shakedown"
[2:53:23] <+runegod20> 0 is just extra long and a single stream every week, sometimes not even that, means this'll take awhile
[2:53:32] <%ChoculaUltra> the hnk game definitely had a lot more driving in it than I expected
[2:53:37] <KeiPrime> steel sharpens steel
[2:53:42] <KillMyPast> ???
[2:53:44] <+noajenkk> yeah i appreciate the take the studio had on it
[2:53:48] <+noajenkk> i dont think the game was bad though
[2:53:48] <Kohei_kyouji> by endgame just equip the payback ring and you can kill shakedown with just 2 or 3 parries
[2:53:49] <KillMyPast> Big coward
[2:53:55] <$StaceMcGate> we probably won't hit Kiwami 1 until Fall
[2:53:57] <Vashido22> the hnk game is great
[2:54:06] <glaciusinfinite> when did you ever lose a normal fight ever?
[2:54:09] <+threeheadedwalrus> that wont be much in like 2 story missions lmao
[2:54:19] <turf_wind_and_fire> Mods, can I whisper a quick question? I don't want to post spoilers in chat
[2:54:27] <+runegod20> i don't think woolie would beat 0 by that point, and i don't think he'll touch kiwami right away like halo
[2:54:31] <+Kuubyy> HAUNTED YAKUZA 0 COPY
[2:54:48] <feralspidey> same energy as GTA V Online, where right after a job or getting a lot of money... immediately b-line to the nearest atm/bank before random encounter
[2:54:51] <%doughvatkyn> woolie should stop duplicating pocket parts then
[2:54:59] <gildedlegacy0117> Like winning the big lottery and realize every thug in sight might a piece. x3
[2:55:02] <Darren716> V's been trying to get you to start business for like 3 hours woolie

[2:55:11] <TheMoenia> oh yeah yakuza 0 doesnt have an atm
[2:55:13] <%doughvatkyn> oda = DEAD
[2:55:31] <glaciusinfinite> 0.01% chance of running into Amon in random battles
[2:55:33] <%doughvatkyn> he expired while kiryu built a pocket racing career
[2:55:48] <Kiryurules> Kiryu has a very localized version of Survivor. Everyone wants to fight him
[2:55:58] <Josef_Stryker> Hit some motherfuckers with another motherfucker

[2:56:20] <+runegod20> the yakuza games are in their own universe where japan is a land infested by barbarians on the strreet
[2:56:21] <jasonisgold79> If there's one thing I will say I'm surprised we haven't done more of yet, it's Kareoke. Gone this long in with the intro and everything, and as far as I know, we haven't seen Bakamitai yet.
[2:56:21] <PerfidiousSinn> beer AND shochu? in THIS economy?
[2:56:37] <jasonisgold79> Granted Woolie has probably seen it online, but still.
[2:56:39] <raveous> yo can't wait for woolie to discover the sepiroth boss fight that only happens when you have over 100 million yen
[2:56:46] <%doomerskeletor13> They did Bakamitai once I think?
[2:56:46] <SherlockianHero> Oda writing One Piece as he waits for Kiryu.

[2:57:05] <%doughvatkyn> weird oda ages well
[2:57:11] <jasonisgold79> @doomerskeletor13 I don't think so. If they did, I don't remember.

[2:59:03] <+TheShisno> I wanna speak to Tachibana
[2:59:22] <X2Eliah> Yeeah no Tachibana is NOT the good guys
[2:59:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Are we the baddies
[2:59:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> @theshisno ok, but fight our entire company first
[2:59:31] <%cache_22> Kiryu wearing glasses is freaking me out a bit.
[2:59:32] <raveous> all about that pride
[2:59:35] <Mcmuffin______> is oda a giant
[2:59:52] <+runegod20> well in the other side, the person staying was being driven out of his place, this guy is just a homeless dude who came into a place he doesn't own
[2:59:59] <%doughvatkyn> invite them in to play sega with you homeless dude
[3:00:04] <sighman55> I like the squat
[3:00:04] <X2Eliah> How tall is that doorframe? 2.0m? 2.2m?
[3:00:04] <penitentpendant> The framing falls apart in that the guy 'defending his bar' figuratively knelt down and scooped up the money going "SUCCKKKERRRS!"
[3:00:52] <turbofolk> Oda pronuonced "Yak-kuza" is that a thing?

[3:01:03] <doomerskeletor13> A lot of main characters in these games are Goliath’s compared to the other NPC’s
[3:01:16] <halfmasks> @turbofolk its threatening pronounciation, like rolling the r's
[3:01:22] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Can't touch the squatter, but the yakuza backing him are fair game. Kappa
[3:01:29] <+MajorCrasher> it's more anti-yakuza scheme
[3:01:29] <%doomerskeletor13> These games can have some questionable morals at times
[3:01:40] <%doughvatkyn> yakuza morals have buffers
[3:01:43] <+NotHereToStream> granny is yakuza
[3:01:43] <+noajenkk> i dont think id call tachibanas motivations good to be fair
[3:01:51] <MyNameIsRasus> If it was an old lady they'd just pay her a shitload of money
[3:01:53] <+MajorCrasher> if it was a stubborn old lady she would take the money

[3:02:26] <%doughvatkyn> m e n a c i n g m a n
[3:02:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Sometimes you just have to roll your eyes at the morals in these games.
[3:02:33] <+runegod20> the guy we're trying to kick out doesn't own the place and isn't renting though, he kind of just broke in
[3:02:45] <jasonisgold79> @doomerskeletor13 Well yeah, you're a Yakuza. Still technically a criminal. Plus the writers opinions change based on their experiences and changing times.
[3:02:47] <leith_aziz> Man, I just jumped back into the stream and we're only here
[3:03:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:03:09] <%doomerskeletor13> The NPC bubble
[3:03:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> The squatter is the real estate equivelent of a patent troll, fuck 'im
[3:03:14] <fluke_LKZ> Yeah, almost like a game about criminals involves characters with dubious morals
[3:03:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can't break the cutscene field
[3:03:23] <leith_aziz> ^^
[3:03:27] <%doughvatkyn> lol i love when the npc bubble has mr shakedown bouncing off of it
[3:03:29] <jasonisgold79> @doomerskeletor13 Plus this is still a game made by Japanese people, mostly for Japanese people.
[3:03:29] <KeiPrime> the bubble
[3:03:30] <X2Eliah> Kiry literally there with 111 mil
[3:03:36] <X2Eliah> Kiryu*

[3:04:40] <jasonisgold79> I know right? A game based in Japan, with Japanese VA, actually MADE by and for Japanese people. It's crazy, let me tell ya.

[3:04:56] <$StaceMcGate> 6 games, and people still haven't heard ofKiryu
[3:04:59] <mister___doctor> They probably kept it under wraps
[3:04:59] <rockethed1> *bleeding
[3:05:00] <penitentpendant> I love that it becomes lore later on, in that old yakuza tell newbies to 'beat up anyone in a white suit'

[3:05:15] <%Asuterisuku> I think Doujima was just trying to save face by _not_ telling anyone about it.
[3:05:15] <+Trickyvic13> in this game kiryu is like a saiyan and starts weak but eventually becones stronger than everyone
[3:05:19] <Karhax> woolie has seen the kettle for sure
[3:05:20] <Jp_DrZaius> keetle yes
[3:05:21] <%Javaa01> @mephium Kettle? Yes. Pliers? No
[3:05:21] <%notsoy> woolie def needs to see the car heat move lmao
[3:05:22] <%doughvatkyn> yeah it's been like 30 minutes since kiryu stormed the dojima office
[3:05:24] <+Hossdaboss747> Essence of TALK SHIT GET HIT
[3:05:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...... LUL
[3:05:26] <Josef_Stryker> Apparently in the PSP spinoff, its an initiation for newbies to pick a fight with Kiryu
[3:05:26] <%jinking79> top secret
[3:05:26] <SherlockianHero> Wait, where’d the nerdy glasses guy go?
[3:05:29] <jasonisgold79> I just imagine Japan people when they hear that news either go 'What anime are you watching?" or "Meh, another tuesday."
[3:05:30] <turbofolk> Ih boi cant wait for Woolie to get mad that Kiryu's story doesnt travel the streets over 3 and a half decades
[3:05:33] <glaciusinfinite> @penitentpendant he has seen the kettle
[3:05:33] <MyNameIsRasus> FUCKED AROUND AND FOUND OUT
[3:05:47] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS GUY
[3:05:48] <penitentpendant> @glaciusinfinite Wrong person, but true
[3:05:49] <%Asuterisuku> Awano controls the Taihei.
[3:05:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Unlike Ichiban, even when Kiryu is starting out, he’s literally already a god like fighter
[3:05:49] <mephium> Oh I see jaava
[3:05:50] <+runegod20> huh, never knew his first name
[3:05:55] <Spagheddies> Man, Awano. What a fucking dude.
[3:05:56] <%doughvatkyn> flashback to best friend awano
[3:06:03] <+Deko_> anyone saw that awano playing soccer video, its the best LUL
[3:06:04] <Darksolerino> from Yakuza 1 on it's established that they just send dudes to attack Kiryu as an initiation of sorts
[3:06:20] <ElPlasa> Dojima: "Boutta beat the shit out of some kid vid later" Also Dojima: "got my ass kicked I aint posting shit"
[3:06:31] <%doomerskeletor13> @darksolerino That’s from one of the PSP spin offs I think
[3:06:42] <+Hossdaboss747> @Darksolerino I love that. A rotation of people to go in and fight Kiryu. "Okay, who's on shift to attack Kiryu tonight?"
[3:06:43] <%doomerskeletor13> The Empty Lot tm
[3:06:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[3:06:51] <%doughvatkyn> dojima: taking a break from twitter
[3:06:55] <%Asuterisuku> Sub families are still run kind of separate from the main ones; Dojima doesn't keep tracks on Kazama, for example.
[3:07:07] <penitentpendant> "Your back up is laid out."
[3:07:40] <MyNameIsRasus> smort
[3:07:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Oda is such a good guy :)

[3:07:55] <%doughvatkyn> o i o i
[3:07:57] <X2Eliah> Yeah but, next night the yakuza come to you and go "why the f*** did you move out?!"
[3:08:03] <TheMoenia> literally the same as yakuza work
[3:08:20] <Josef_Stryker> Oda is such a sleezebag
[3:08:21] <Blank9> kiryu literally joined the yakuza for cool cars
[3:08:26] <whimsicallifestyle> odas handsome in like a messy way
[3:08:28] <%doughvatkyn> don't badtalk friend of kiryu
[3:08:29] <Spagheddies> Oda is Sleeze Made Man.
[3:08:37] <Josef_Stryker> Kiryu joined because his adoptive dad was soooo cool
[3:08:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Damn it’s almost like the business world is run like the Yakuza. I wonder if they’re trying to make a point there woolieSMUG
[3:08:46] <turbofolk> Dont think about how Oda is a stand in for akiyama
[3:08:47] <%aram909> SERENAAAAAAA
[3:08:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just punch the real estate
[3:08:48] <%Asuterisuku> I don't think Kiryu ever got a driver's license.
[3:08:53] <arkv01> someone's gotta sell these buildings
[3:08:55] <shieldecho> Aw, Serena!
[3:08:56] <penitentpendant> Social Links Go?
[3:08:57] <%Asuterisuku> So it can't really be about the cars.
[3:09:04] <Darren716> Oh shit yeah Kiryu hasnt been to Seena next

[3:09:10] <Clundy> Oda is Grease Lightning
[3:09:22] <%cache_22> Is Serena the most used building in all of the Yakuza series?
[3:09:24] <DSD24> @Asuterisuku I mean he did become that one job in Yakuza 5
[3:09:24] <alvaroeltz> @Asuterisuku did you play any of the other games?
[3:09:31] <%doomerskeletor13> @asuterisuku He definitely has one by 5 tho
[3:09:34] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Now it's time for you to be introduced to the first set of jobbers. Kappa
[3:09:41] <Darren716> I think the most common objective in the whole series is "Go to Serena"
[3:09:45] <zanzibarian_hamster> Has woolie picked up a turkey from the bowling alley?
[3:09:47] <%Asuterisuku> @alvaroeltz Not all the way. About a 3rd of the way through 3.
[3:09:47] <penitentpendant> Would Oda be "The Devil" for his card?

[3:22:10] <penitentpendant> He saw Kiryu's poly count and new he could trust him
[3:22:12] <+Crippl3> reminder that the concept of alpha/beta was basically entirely made up due to bad research and experiments, and the original author of the study has disowned it
[3:22:14] <cafeapathy> im very confused but im getting my wolf lawyers
[3:22:15] <Kiryurules> KEIKAKU DORI
[3:22:27] <cafeapathy> when you debunk *yourself*
[3:22:30] <Meteorrainer> Kiryu only pawn in game of life
[3:22:45] <spuddnyk> Constant questions too
[3:22:47] <Kiryurules> That's why I love Ichiban
[3:22:48] <OldManDeckardCain> DESTINY IS DESTINY
[3:22:48] <RyuShinden> The Reluctant Hero
[3:22:52] <penitentpendant> He is a stoic, so things have to HAPPEN to him. He's not proactive.
[3:22:54] <Blank9> kiryu is just passive power
[3:22:55] <+runegod20> feels about right
[3:23:04] <DSD24> Kiryu would start talking about MUFF
[3:23:07] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu is an extremely reactive character.
[3:23:08] <%Livelinne> aww Kiryus sugar daddy promoted him grymLove
[3:23:11] <%patriotrenegade> I murdered Koreans with Kazama once upon a time ago
[3:23:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yeah, Kiryu is a loner who goes at his own pace...like an alpha...or maybe something else..
[3:23:15] <TheMoenia> thats why they have multiple main characters in four and fice
[3:23:16] <%doughvatkyn> kiryu also seems to love being wrangled into new community struggles
[3:23:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well
[3:23:16] <%sneekypotato> kiryu the walking wall
[3:23:21] <Kiryurules> Ichiban meanwhile is insanely proactive
[3:23:22] <+Ancopro> like start an orphanage or somethin
[3:23:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Kyriu is the Immovable object
[3:23:30] <%Animatic_> that's sort of the reason people like ichiban. he's the exact opposite.
[3:23:32] <%doomerskeletor13> I love that he says Kiryu resembles Kazama in his youth when they’re not even actually related
[3:23:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Ancopro Orphanage MK II
[3:23:35] <MyNameIsRasus> "Love blooming on the battlefield? I'm starting to see the appeal..."
[3:23:36] <+BloodyBurney> those are the best moments in these games imo
[3:23:39] <rafflespaddock> More like a modern Kenshiro
[3:23:40] <whimsicallifestyle> woolie maybe youll like ichiban from 7
[3:23:40] <RyuShinden> Villains create situations, and the heroes react. Pretty normal.
[3:23:45] <DSD24> Ichiban is a reverse Kiryu
[3:23:47] <%doughvatkyn> kiryu: dtsq, down to sidequest
[3:23:55] <Clundy> Kiryu writes sins not tragedies
[3:23:55] <X2Eliah> Are you ready to learn to Bidness?

[3:34:07] <KillMyPast> She only used 20% of her true power
[3:34:09] <+Standard_Enemy> It's company policy to let customers win
[3:34:13] <cafeapathy> 'spend more money at our alley, chump'
[3:34:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hey Emiri. See ya.
[3:34:16] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> She has lovely hair

[3:36:15] <SherlockianHero> It’s so hard to be a man.
[3:36:16] <BlueJoneleth> @OblivionSword1 yeah when I played the game I looked up info on the building management minigame and somehow ended on pornhub XD
[3:36:18] <%doomerskeletor13> STONKS BABY

[3:36:27] <yukichocomilk> late LUL
[3:36:32] <therealtacopancakes> bidness
[3:36:33] <KillMyPast> Woolie you fool
[3:36:34] <+SuperKirby24> actual stonks
[3:36:35] <Darren716> Woolie you're just slow
[3:36:36] <doomerskeletor13> Woolie you’re in the first third of the game still
[3:36:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> YEYEYEYE
[3:36:37] <user_naim> you dont know
[3:36:40] <+Balkespower> "Why is my secretary a porn star?"
[3:36:42] <%big_laser_boss> It's very early
[3:36:43] <OldManDeckardCain> nothing compared to mahjong LUL
[3:36:45] <halfmasks> oh you dont know
[3:36:46] <%Asuterisuku> "Late" woolieSMUG
[3:36:51] <%doughvatkyn> my business tweet (1/256)

[3:37:06] <cafeapathy> inventory your supply, something the manifest? b-buisiness...
[3:37:06] <+Balkespower> ^
[3:37:07] <halfmasks> @Balkespower ive seen that lady at the bowling alley counter somewhere, but i dont know why
[3:37:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Stonks for Dumbasses"
[3:37:12] <OldManDeckardCain> you can do this one mostly passively
[3:37:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Put number in number to make the number go up
[3:37:16] <penitentpendant> Now to see the world as the Canadian Legitimate Businessmen do!
[3:37:17] <reonome> cha ching
[3:37:19] <%doomerskeletor13> A lot of these tutorials make things seem way more complicated than they are
[3:37:20] <OldManDeckardCain> the cabaret is more involved
[3:37:29] <+Asuterisuku> Really, most of the business game is off-screen worthy.
[3:37:33] <brachydios777> Essence of STONKS
[3:37:37] <Darren716> Hey I just realized, the 5 billionaires aren't too impressive in Japan, just means they have a net worth of $10M
[3:37:37] <+runegod20> doesn't the game guide you through it anyway the first time around?
[3:37:40] <+TheShisno> Money - money = Money²
[3:37:41] <cafeapathy> ah, so just as confusing, got it
[3:37:58] <+runegod20> i tihnk the big thing stopping real estate from being off screen is randomly coming across and starting side stories
[3:38:01] <SherlockianHero> I LOVE idle mobile games!
[3:38:15] <%zanzibar_junker> Yakuza 7 has the best version of this game
[3:38:20] <%doughvatkyn> Money.... Battle....
[3:38:21] <+Balkespower> @Balkespower and the cabaret girl also seem familiar
[3:38:22] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu behaving more like a yakuza here than any of the other games.
[3:38:27] <+Balkespower> *girls
[3:38:27] <penitentpendant> "Deal With Them"
[3:38:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> MASH TO MONEY
[3:38:46] <aurasviel> Briefcase you says
[3:38:55] <OblivionSword1> MASH TO STONKS
[3:38:55] <penitentpendant> Both people bribing the employee at the same time
[3:38:57] <RyuShinden> Essence of STONKS
[3:38:58] <+Balkespower> PUMP THE MONEY!
[3:39:00] <rafflespaddock> literally throw money at each other
[3:39:01] <+SuperKirby24> mash to stonks
[3:39:02] <%doomerskeletor13> MONEY FIGHT
[3:39:08] <+TheShisno> 2.71B cash injection to save the property
[3:39:10] <%Javaa01> Literally just throw money at the problem
[3:39:22] <+doughvatkyn> money battles scared the shit out of me when they first came up
[3:39:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[3:39:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Just hold the line

[3:39:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> SOON OUR TENDIES WILL COME
[3:39:51] <reg806> STONKS IS STRONK
[3:40:00] <gatorafan> 🚀 🚀 🚀
[3:40:01] <%Asuterisuku> Some managers are better than others.
[3:40:02] <+runegod20> bigger numbers means more main get
[3:40:02] <%doughvatkyn> now you see the real reason for doing side quests
[3:40:07] <penitentpendant> It basically tries to force you to cycle managers
[3:40:07] <+runegod20> money get
[3:40:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's how a manual should be
[3:40:27] <aurasviel> GameStop more like gamestonk
[3:40:40] <Darren716> Why are there 2 -1's?
[3:40:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> ding
[3:41:00] <brachydios777> Negative is less money
[3:41:03] <+TheShisno> Ding
[3:41:14] <+Ancopro> spend money make money
[3:41:15] <CharlieDJohnson> i never got the numbers thing because from what i can tell it only moves forward if that employee is actually active so you gotta eat those -1's anyway
[3:41:18] <+doughvatkyn> someone explain circles and triangles because i didn't figure it out for hours
[3:41:20] <penitentpendant> @Darren716 Every time they do a 'turn' it moves right. The multiplier goes down the more 'turns' you do the same person.
[3:41:21] <winner_92> put the money to make the money
[3:41:22] <halfmasks> @Darren716 its means for two collections, the value is -1
[3:41:31] <glaciusinfinite> Kiryu's rise starts now
[3:41:31] <Blank9> buy houses and hotels for your monopoly property
[3:41:35] <habberdash> yo this is my first time catching yakuza live, i see the boys have reached the business management sim
[3:41:41] <MyNameIsRasus> It changes based on the guy I think
[3:41:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> @doughvatkyn Circle good, triangle Okay, X bad
[3:41:46] <halfmasks> its not a scale its an hp bar i think
[3:41:54] <%doughvatkyn> ok dat easy
[3:41:54] <Darren716> What about square?
[3:42:02] <%doughvatkyn> fuck
[3:42:04] <%Livelinne> songcoMoarmoney songcoMoarmoney woolieGASM songcoMoarmoney songcoMoarmoney
[3:42:11] <+runegod20> so some people get worse if you use them too much, some start out crappy, get super good, than get back to crappy until you let them rest
[3:42:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> SourPls
[3:42:26] <+Ancopro> whO?
[3:42:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Kappa
[3:42:27] <brachydios777> So did Kiryu still had these property in 95?
[3:42:27] <+SuperKirby24> I wonder who Kappa
[3:42:29] <Darren716> Kappa
[3:42:35] <penitentpendant> Beat Mr. Shakedown enough, then hire him.
[3:42:43] <habberdash> whats this real estate doing in my crime drama? its because Real Estate is the true crime 😏
[3:42:45] <+Crippl3> Read the Security quotes
[3:42:52] <%doughvatkyn> @brachydios777 nah every single property burned down
[3:42:52] <alvaroeltz> He just has a big chest
[3:42:55] <Haarute> Just have a big chest.
[3:42:59] <jinjun1738> d7eeymPeepohmm d7eeymPeepohmm d7eeymPeepohmm d7eeymPeepohmm d7eeymPeepohmm
[3:43:15] <%ThisIsLloyd> and now the real game begins
[3:43:16] <+SuperKirby24> imagine hiring mr shakedown for security LUL
[3:43:30] <KillMyPast> Theres no manager or security there right now
[3:43:32] <%Asuterisuku> Triangle is neutral.
[3:43:34] <brachydios777> @doughvatkyn It was the bubble pop wasn’t it?
[3:43:45] <%big_laser_boss> Woolie needs to find the mushroom seller
[3:43:49] <%doughvatkyn> triangle is heal
[3:43:50] <%Javaa01> Also ability rank is important
[3:43:51] <Spagheddies> X is worst. Triangle is meh. Circle is fine. Double circle is best.
[3:44:06] <+runegod20> i think when you get high ablity rank, a higher rank is worth more than a support ability
[3:44:10] <Spagheddies> And the stars multiply the effectiveness of each.
[3:44:10] <%doughvatkyn> circle is roll
[3:44:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Free money
[3:44:16] <%Javaa01> So a 1 star with a double circle is gonna upgrade less then a 4 star with a single circle
[3:44:26] <+Balkespower> Woolie is learning free real estate
[3:44:26] <+runegod20> so like rank 5 triangle is better than a rank 3 double circle I think
[3:44:30] <@Menitta> OH HE STARTED FREE REAL ESTATE
[3:44:32] <Iniudan> You have to put the staff currently
[3:44:34] <penitentpendant> "Investment Period"
[3:44:34] <Haarute> staff is not set yet
[3:44:38] <OblivionSword1> per collection
[3:44:38] <LittleWulfie> Noone's selected for Staff
[3:44:39] <KillMyPast> You dont have a manager or security in the area yet
[3:44:42] <Tuna_Can_0> Retail investing is so EASY distHypers
[3:44:43] <Iniudan> stat set is on the bottom left
[3:44:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> Go buy property
[3:44:47] <Iniudan> staff*
[3:44:48] <Vigogs> can only upgrade once per cycle
[3:44:53] <+Ancopro> right now is prep
[3:44:54] <%Javaa01> You can only pump a property once per collection round
[3:44:54] <wolfdoctor80> there is no staff assigned
[3:44:57] <ARDM112> No he doesn't
[3:44:59] <+Balkespower> assign them first
[3:45:01] <KillMyPast> No manager yet
[3:45:04] <+MajorCrasher> @javaa01 yes, but that will rarely happen. most 1 stars don't have more than a circle
[3:45:20] <turbofolk> hooo boy its gonna be a long road to the 4th style

[4:21:19] <user_naim> Why there?

[4:21:38] <MyNameIsRasus> you broke it
[4:21:40] <%Javaa01> Your shit broke
[4:21:45] <mortificent> YOU BROKE IT
[4:21:46] <glaciusinfinite> remember you hsvea wall beat move
[4:21:50] <Haarute> attacking with it means it breaks
[4:22:00] <xbb1024> this will take a while
[4:22:14] <%big_laser_boss> USE THE QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[4:22:19] <%LastHazzerd> it'll be good background noise for a while
[4:22:21] <%kewlmyc> I'm go order some take out as this will be a while
[4:22:25] <%Asuterisuku> Greedy
[4:22:28] <user_naim> You cand do the back-to-the-wall heat move on him
[4:22:29] <+runegod20> those hit boxes
[4:22:34] <coreyyotto> Quick-change
[4:22:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> OOOOOOOF
[4:22:38] <winner_92> do they have the upgrade where quickstepping gives you heat in rush mode yet
[4:22:41] <brunoberserk> !PANIC!
[4:22:51] <%big_laser_boss> EQUIP THE QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES
[4:22:55] <+runegod20> i think so because that upgrade is the first move one you get
[4:23:02] <coreyyotto> It's like Guard Canceling in DMC3 try it
[4:23:06] <rosemon5001> time to get stomped
[4:23:10] <%big_laser_boss> Style canceling
[4:23:23] <%Asuterisuku> iFrames
[4:23:24] <%big_laser_boss> IT'S A FREE FADC
[4:23:25] <OldManDeckardCain> you can get one shot with change clothes LUL
[4:23:27] <+duichenko> WOW
[4:23:27] <+Ancopro> that was a royal release
[4:23:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOW
[4:23:32] <penitentpendant> Praise the I-frames!
[4:23:34] <+Idziman> big balls woolie
[4:23:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> You didn't win
[4:23:51] <+Balkespower> SMOKING SEXY STYLE
[4:23:54] <+runegod20> i forget they give him thug counters, which is scary as hell
[4:24:01] <%Asuterisuku> Repeated Heat Actions get reduced returns.
[4:24:05] <Haarute> did you buy the wall heat move last session?
[4:24:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rush does better with high heat woolie
[4:24:20] <%big_laser_boss> USE QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES TO CANCEL OUT OF END LAG
[4:24:37] <%notsoy> back-to-wall heat moves are super good
[4:24:49] <user_naim> back to wall
[4:24:52] <+duichenko> Damnnnn
[4:24:55] <penitentpendant> Standing with your back against a wall, with one bar in rush is one, but it's finnicky
[4:24:55] <glaciusinfinite> not worth it for stale heat
[4:24:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> THAT IS A BAD HABIT
[4:25:00] <benjvdb9> Bobbing and weaving can halt heat depletion too
[4:25:00] <%big_laser_boss> TRY THE STYLE CHANGE TO SAVE ON RECOVERY FRAMES
[4:25:08] <heylookitswex> try and pick some stuff off the ground for heat moves
[4:25:15] <+runegod20> didn't we unlock taunting for rush
[4:25:17] <+Balkespower> OH MY GOD
[4:25:19] <lem______> silly chat, thinking woolie is reading
[4:25:19] <%big_laser_boss> Yes
[4:25:22] <+duichenko> THE whiffff
[4:25:23] <+Balkespower> MY HEART
[4:25:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> whew
[4:25:26] <+runegod20> a bit risky but in some cases it cna help
[4:25:41] <coreyyotto> But remember, Hesitation is Defeat, a late Change Cancel will still fuck you over if you do it at the wrong time
[4:25:54] <+duichenko> OOF
[4:25:57] <%Holycow8498> You can do it Woolie i habebe
[4:26:00] <%big_laser_boss> THKERE IS A SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU CHANGE STYLE. CANCELING IS NEARLY FREE
[4:26:19] <Dabrikishaw> Almost
[4:26:20] <penitentpendant> Makin' money just from the fight
[4:26:20] <Haarute> you can switch to brawler when he's on the floor for another heat move if you have bar
[4:26:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> 2 punches worth of damage
[4:26:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> He got this
[4:26:32] <OblivionSword1> we need better weapon at some point
[4:26:34] <+Balkespower> Now he will one shot you
[4:26:34] <+abrupt_abe> Shakedown becomes free after next Majima chapter anyway
[4:26:53] <%Holycow8498> How much money did this guy have?
[4:27:01] <OblivionSword1> 600 mil ish
[4:27:02] <%Javaa01> Style switching happens in bullet time
[4:27:02] <KeiPrime> 600m+
[4:27:02] <chainsaw105> 1 hit now will absolutely clobber you
[4:27:03] <MyNameIsRasus> like 600 mil
[4:27:03] <BabblingBayou> 600
[4:27:11] <+duichenko> just out of reach
[4:27:11] <%Holycow8498> Oh that's a decent amount
[4:27:11] <@Menitta> thats pretty worth it
[4:27:13] <coreyyotto> It can cancel recovery animations and replace it with the style change animation, basically. You're replace a long animation with a shorter one, essentially
[4:27:15] <+chiazam> Are they doing this fight too early?
[4:27:25] <TundraOW> Yes, but it's worth
[4:27:27] <%big_laser_boss> CHANGING STYLES GIVES YOU A SLOW DOWN BY DEFAULT.
[4:27:36] <%Asuterisuku> @chiazam Not really, Shakedown is Shakedown.
[4:27:36] <Dabrikishaw> Damn, a half billion alreadt?
[4:27:41] <@Menitta> Does Woolie have the upgrade that lets him dodge cancel mid combo?
[4:27:42] <$arcielardor> !uptime
[4:27:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 27 minutes
[4:27:46] <%big_laser_boss> FADC
[4:27:52] <@Menitta> If so that should make shakedown a breeze
[4:27:59] <%big_laser_boss> IT'S A SF4 FADC
[4:28:11] <coreyyotto> The dodge cancel costs heat though
[4:28:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rush works better with high heat tho
[4:28:25] <@Menitta> Ooooh right
[4:28:30] <+jiggy_snipe> omg the camera
[4:28:33] <penitentpendant> Camera's havin' a fit
[4:28:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:28:34] <@Menitta> Yeah rush with max heats melts
[4:28:35] <MyNameIsRasus> you got this wool
[4:28:37] <+jiggy_snipe> ooooooo WOOLIE
[4:28:41] <MyNameIsRasus> woolz*
[4:28:42] <winner_92> couldnt he build heat easily by spamming dodge while showdown sharges
[4:28:42] <+abrupt_abe> Clooooose
[4:28:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> woooooof
[4:28:48] <+Balkespower> this is not good for my heart
[4:28:50] <Haarute> do you have the upgrade that gives you heat when you dodge an attack?
[4:28:53] <MyNameIsRasus> good combo
[4:29:06] <+runegod20> @Haarute he does, but i'm pretty sure he forgot
[4:29:20] <%big_laser_boss> ALWAYS STYLE CHANGE. IT SHORTENS RECOVERY FOR BIG MOVES
[4:29:27] <CharlieDJohnson> did anyone ever tell woolie that repeat heat actions barely do dmaage?
[4:29:33] <realestjojo> has he given up on changing up heat moves?
[4:29:33] <+kooldude65> This is the second time i've randomely tuned in and they are fighting shakedown haha
[4:29:35] <KillMyPast> Quick change makes it easier to dodge
[4:29:43] <artiimo> @CharlieDJohnson we did
[4:29:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> USE AN ENVIRONMENT ITEM INSTEAD
[4:29:54] <penitentpendant> Good dodge
[4:29:55] <+abrupt_abe> Oooooooof
[4:29:55] <+Balkespower> OH MY GOD
[4:29:57] <CharlieDJohnson> curse woolie in that case
[4:29:58] <%Asuterisuku> Get to the wall!
[4:29:58] <+Balkespower> jesus
[4:30:02] <Dabrikishaw> He knows, but hear moves are still free damage
[4:30:07] <ARDM112> Stand with back to a wall
[4:30:09] <glaciusinfinite> wall heat
[4:30:09] <penitentpendant> Rush has a counter move against a wall
[4:30:11] <%big_laser_boss> ALLOWING YOU TO ATTACK WITH BRAWL/BEAST AND ESCAPE WITH RUSH ON THE SAME COMBO
[4:30:11] <%Javaa01> Rush has the back against the wall one
[4:30:14] <penitentpendant> But it needs a bar
[4:30:17] <user_naim> Back to the wall
[4:30:19] <+runegod20> it is a sick ass looking move though
[4:30:26] <%Holycow8498> back to the wall needs also level 3 heat
[4:30:32] <coreyyotto> That Y move is good damage just go for that
[4:30:41] <+runegod20> damn, is it really 3 bars?
[4:30:44] <Solidnick18> he only get's stronger
[4:30:45] <brachydios777> Wall move is 1 bad
[4:30:54] <penitentpendant> @Holycow8498 The prompt showed up when he had only 1
[4:30:55] <BabblingBayou> Woolie really needs better weapons after this..
[4:30:55] <brachydios777> *1 bar
[4:30:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> 3 more
[4:31:09] <%big_laser_boss> LOOK UP QUICK-CHANGE CLOTHES VS SHAKEDOWN FOR A GOOD DEMONSTRATION

[4:31:11] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie should go to Sushi Gin and see what that quest requires.
[4:31:15] <CharlieDJohnson> "He knows, but hear moves are still free damage" the damage bonus he gets from retaining heat and faster attacks is much more free damage tho
[4:31:16] <%nintega010> It's funny how stressful these fights are
[4:31:23] <%Dapper_Cactuar> can we get a game that's just Egashira's adventures as he travels and trains?
[4:31:24] <lets_be_friendos> monkaS
[4:31:26] <%Holycow8498> ??? so you only need to be in second level heat for the back to wall move?
[4:31:33] <%Holycow8498> Huh guess i miss remembered

[4:31:49] <brachydios777> VICTORY
[4:31:49] <+runegod20> i think woolie partly forgot that heat increases move and attack speed, plus damage, but I think he'd want to just trade it in for free damage anyway
[4:31:49] <mortificent> yeyeyeyeyeyyye
[4:31:52] <Jp_DrZaius> yay
[4:31:52] <%AMUSERNAME> @WoolieVersus Quick-change clothes are BAD if you aren't style switching, because they have VERY LOW ARMOR.

[4:37:29] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus Think of Quick-change clothes as a form of SF4 FADC. By changing styles mid attack you can replace the recovery with the style-changing animation. Changing styles always slows down time around Kiryu so it's practical instant in game time.

[4:44:20] <Leddy_at_Home> Remembering QTA, has V played 13S?
[4:44:23] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus The thing to know about the Quick-change clothes: Their description in-game is misleading. They make it sound like they'll make the style-changing animation faster, but it already slows down time around you. What they actually do is allow you to change styles during any part of your attack animation. Think of it like a SF4 FADC with no cost.
[4:44:27] <%AMUSERNAME> @WoolieVersus "Hey Juro, check out this cool porn videotape!" -Chiba
[4:44:30] <+Standard_Enemy> That prison wine is too good
[4:44:47] <+runegod20> profit is profit
[4:44:57] <penitentpendant> It's very rewarding to "Pat" this questline, so the temptation is understandably STRONG
[4:45:14] <+runegod20> I think in the SBFP LP, they 100% maxed out real estate before they went to do the current story quest we have now
[4:45:15] <CharlieDJohnson> tbh that story progress you need to do is like half an hour or so ferom now
[4:45:19] <%Juriasu> woolieMINHMAX
[4:45:21] <Darren716> Honestly this is best to do off screan
[4:45:24] <alvaroeltz> CALL MIHN, QUICK
[4:45:32] <mortificent> so if you're Pat
[4:45:37] <penitentpendant> "Grinding Offscreen" is definitely this
[4:45:40] <su6human> you can't finish the story but you can still max out the area V
[4:45:51] <@Menitta> I love b-lining the side story business games in Yakuza. I found it so rewarding in both 0 and 7
[4:45:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> It grinds off screen for you
[4:45:57] <Darren716> Hey people talk shit about grinding offscrean, but god damn it's efficient
[4:46:14] <alvaroeltz> Later it will take longer to advance, so yes
[4:46:15] <Leddy_at_Home> The side story rewards for 0's side quest are best before story I feel
[4:46:22] <%Javaa01> And beaten areas you can grind for money as much as you want
[4:46:30] <Darren716> Like Pat trimmed a ton of fat off the original Yakuza 0 play through
[4:46:47] <+Kai_Sense1> Woolie can finally stop fighting shakedown for money. Now he can fight shakedown for the W.
[4:46:53] <+TheShisno> Fuck Out Run, that's all I'm saying
[4:46:54] <syanplague> V the mark is 30%, 60% and 90%
[4:46:54] <Medo3G> Producer?
[4:47:02] <penitentpendant> @Menitta Level up that Office Ninja in 7 the moment you get her
[4:47:03] <+runegod20> you eventually start learning the thresholds for the big milestones, and you do still run into side quests, even if you don't finish them, you miss out on the beginning on camera
[4:47:05] <MyNameIsRasus> The need for speed
[4:47:16] <%r0chelimit> It takes a bit of grinding but holy shit can you make some cash with the real estate stuff
[4:47:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Take the L
[4:47:39] <Kohei_kyouji> why not buy the cheap stuff?
[4:47:47] <@Menitta> Also the process for "grinding" the real estate is start collection and then go play Outrun in the club Sega
[4:47:50] <%Asuterisuku> >Implying Brawler is ever not viable
[4:48:04] <+Balkespower> Taunt for heat is good
[4:48:09] <+runegod20> oh damn, we can almost do every training move for rush
[4:48:15] <+Kai_Sense1> Closest thing to tiger drop in the game tho
[4:48:24] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie should really go to his style trainers though.
[4:48:25] <%Javaa01> Get all the 30 mil unlocks cause why not and then pick and choose what you want in the 100mil range
[4:48:43] <%Asuterisuku> Snatching Strike is so good.
[4:48:46] <@Menitta> Snatching Strike is so cool
[4:48:50] <%notsoy> snatching strike is SUPER good against shakedown
[4:48:53] <%r0chelimit> I'd recommend getting the training for all the styles as soon as possible
[4:48:55] <+runegod20> 30 mil is chump change enough that I'm pretty sure we can buy them all and still have some left over
[4:49:05] <%big_laser_boss> Snatching strike works on SHAKEDOWN and is really good
[4:49:22] <Dabrikishaw> Snatching Strike is really sick I agree
[4:49:29] <su6human> snatching strike, the Shakedown breaker
[4:49:29] <%Asuterisuku> Start with a drop kick when at no heat.
[4:49:35] <penitentpendant> The weird contextual buffs
[4:49:38] <+runegod20> snatching strike sounds cool but something you would easily forget you have
[4:49:46] <%big_laser_boss> Dropp kik on round start for full heat
[4:50:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ora ora
[4:50:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:50:26] <+Balkespower> He even screams ORA in that Heat move
[4:50:35] <+runegod20> so dodge cancel out of rush combos?
[4:50:37] <%Asuterisuku> You can get literally all of your Mastery moves now.
[4:50:39] <Blank9> step out is amazing

[4:51:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:51:37] <TheHeroAppears> that one is good

[4:52:01] <+SuperKirby24> the miss tatsu move Kreygasm

[4:52:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> Essence of chubakka
[4:52:12] <%big_laser_boss> I never use dodge canceling out of rush considering I rely so much on the Quick-change clothes already
[4:52:18] <primaryfire> that one is pretty rad
[4:52:19] <fIashman92> Later on you get a free heat move anyways
[4:52:20] <+runegod20> beast can build crazy heat with how many hits it does
[4:52:23] <+roleplayfever> combo breaker move
[4:52:29] <%sneekypotato> you can even use it against shakedown I think
[4:52:36] <Kohei_kyouji> its 'free' in the sense that it requires no skill
[4:52:36] <+runegod20> ooo, dual stab is badass
[4:52:43] <heylookitswex> don't forget to go to your trainers for more moves
[4:52:44] <+Balkespower> that one is also Brutal
[4:52:53] <%big_laser_boss> Take your time to learn about the ways of the Quick-change clothes Woolie
[4:52:59] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[4:53:00] <penitentpendant> I unironically look forward to the training montage where you spam all their quests
[4:53:02] <lem______> @woolieversus is V beholden to leaving asap as well?
[4:53:15] <Blank9> step out
[4:53:18] <+Balkespower> spend it on the moves to get the masteries
[4:53:19] <penitentpendant> Especially "Assassin Clowncar Alley"
[4:53:28] <OblivionSword1> whatever you want woolie
[4:53:35] <dead_harmony13> dodge cancels
[4:53:53] <%big_laser_boss> style change cancels
[4:54:04] <%nintega010> I honestly wanna see sunlight yellow overdrive
[4:54:07] <%Asuterisuku> Snatching Strike is so cool.
[4:54:22] <%Asuterisuku> And it doesn't cost heat here like it does in Kiwami!
[4:54:24] <%aram909> owl spirit is great
[4:54:27] <+runegod20> iron fist is so cool but it's a weapon specific move so it's a bit rare
[4:54:31] <%aram909> you can just spam the weave and get so much heat
[4:54:37] <%Holycow8498> I feel like Woolie really wants to Ora ora ora the enemies
[4:54:39] <penitentpendant> Sushi Gin?
[4:54:41] <%aram909> BECOME THE BOXER
[4:54:51] <%big_laser_boss> Unfortunately; snatching strike takes the same place as my favorite heat move
[4:54:54] <%Holycow8498> Oh hey some goosn to beat up
[4:55:06] <Darksolerino> WHAT A PITTANCE
[4:55:14] <KillMyPast> You can cancel out of slower moves
[4:55:18] <KeiPrime> missing the point, cancel out of the BIG moves
[4:55:34] <alvaroeltz> Cancel out of the dropkick, is the best
[4:55:37] <%Asuterisuku> That's a skill you can get later, V.
[4:55:39] <TundraOW> He's trying to cancel like you would in Kiwami
[4:55:40] <%big_laser_boss> yes if you cancel into brawlers counter
[4:55:49] <KillMyPast> Its best to cancel out of slow Y moves
[4:55:50] <+runegod20> isn't that something you can get in later games?
[4:55:55] <Leddy_at_Home> Crash Addiction is just a good battle theme
[4:56:02] <benjvdb9> Try doing a dropkick in brawler and cancel the recovery. It's great to pick up their legs
[4:56:03] <adamisfruit> @darksolerino classic Kevin Nash
[4:56:03] <+Balkespower> AAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:56:04] <+Euphbugg> D:
[4:56:08] <+bearwagon> that does so much damage
[4:56:08] <+Balkespower> that move
[4:56:10] <@Menitta> YEET
[4:56:11] <Solidnick18> ouch
[4:56:21] <%Javaa01> And you can use that to yeet Shakedown
[4:56:21] <jorniev> dislocated his arms
[4:56:24] <Hyde_01> brutal
[4:56:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> You threw him head first without his arms to brace the fall, the man is dead
[4:56:28] <%big_laser_boss> Good though; experiment on using the Quick-change clothes
[4:56:36] <user_naim> Y e e t
[4:56:37] <%Holycow8498> Should we have a no kill counter compilation
[4:56:38] <jorniev> HE DISLOCATES THEYR ARMS
[4:56:40] <su6human> you can cancel out of combo finishers tho, takes a lotta risk out of being aggressive with Shakedown
[4:56:45] <penitentpendant> Add that to the Mortal Kombat special pile
[4:56:48] <+duichenko> manager?
[4:57:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The best moves are situational things for bike racks and concrete pillars and shit
[4:57:00] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:57:16] <%Asuterisuku> Shakedown is a gamble, Real Estate is reliable.
[4:57:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:57:17] <+runegod20> i think a max level shakedown is the most money, but the real estate is still super good, consistant, and way faster to do
[4:57:17] <+abrupt_abe> Shakedown is exponential
[4:57:18] <+RJay80> shakedown is supreme stonks
[4:57:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> Shakedown is actually the best way to make money
[4:57:18] <+BusterRepukken> cigerettes are so cool
[4:57:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> especially the backturned versions
[4:57:22] <%Javaa01> And you can feed your business money into the walking ATM and multiply your money
[4:57:24] <%big_laser_boss> Drop-kick into knuckle cracking
[4:57:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> Huh, wound't figure Kiryu as a menthol man
[4:57:27] <%r0chelimit> It depends on how much he's carrying honestly. And he can carry a looooooooooooooot
[4:57:31] <OblivionSword1> but the business is still very important
[4:57:35] <zhenthrim213> the kaneshiro palace
[4:57:35] <+MajorCrasher> the business absolutely gives more money than shakedown by the end. it's faster too
[4:57:48] <+Ether101_Prime> If you want to use the Win-Lose exploit then Mr. Shackdown can give you maximum money.
[4:57:49] <penitentpendant> Good sesh~
[4:57:52] <mister___doctor> Kiryu smoking is bad for you
[4:57:55] <%Asuterisuku> Good stream!
[4:57:58] <@Menitta> Glad I caught the latter half
[4:58:01] <artiimo> thank god it's 2am for me
[4:58:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Backturned beast heatmoves are fucking awesome
[4:58:02] <OblivionSword1> the reward for the business at the end is still really important
[4:58:02] <RyuShinden> Clap
[4:58:05] <+RJay80> i look forward to watching the anime cause i just got here rooScream

[4:58:16] <@Menitta> STONKS
[4:58:16] <chainsaw105> you get Mr. Shakedown's deep pockets, then lose a fight, win a fight. lose, win, lose, win. etc
[4:58:18] <%big_laser_boss> except SHAKEDOWN can almost double your current money
[4:58:18] <Mahbonk> bidnuss

[4:58:35] <brachydios777> Good session, see you guys later
[4:58:38] <+RJay80> my current shakedown gives my 1.8B
[4:58:38] <HollowMan190> its ganna be a long lp....
[4:58:41] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes
[4:58:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Balkespower
[4:58:46] <jorniev> ITS FREE REAL ESTATE
[4:58:58] <%r0chelimit> Business at the end was giving me 1.5 bil per payout. that said mr. shakedown can give you ridiculous cash
[4:59:10] <Equirah> big desynch
[4:59:12] <OblivionSword1> or play shogi
[4:59:14] <+Balkespower> even more with Mr. Shakedown deep pockets
[4:59:25] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Infinite Money Works
[4:59:30] <+Ether101_Prime> You can max out money with Mr. Shackdown if you want too.
[4:59:32] <chainsaw105> first you stock up on zap guns to rip Shakedown's asshole apart
[4:59:33] <BerryliciousDefinition> Its free real estate
[4:59:39] <%Javaa01> Also the business unlocks the rest of the skilltrees
[4:59:47] <lem______> shakedown LLC
[4:59:52] <%Javaa01> So you can power up even further beyond
[4:59:59] <+Balkespower> Majima is great
[5:00:03] <%r0chelimit> Majima has better fighting styles IMO
[5:00:06] <%kewlmyc> Majima is just more fun period honestly
[5:00:08] <%big_laser_boss> Give SHAKEDOWN your money and take it back with 60% profit
[5:00:14] <KillMyPast> I honestly found Majima to be boring to play
[5:00:17] <primaryfire> beast charged attacks fuck
[5:00:23] <jorniev> majima is still the protagonist in my heart
[5:00:27] <Space_Pagan> Majima best boi
[5:00:34] <+RJay80> ngl with kiryu i just use beast and brawler only to break guards
[5:00:36] <%sneekypotato> kiryu has some great moments in this game as well
[5:00:37] <turbofolk> So whens the dead souls LP?
[5:00:37] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes makes Kiryu so much more fun to play with
[5:00:39] <+Balkespower> Majima needs more game for himself
[5:00:46] <digitalslime> beast is as good as bat but majimas other styles are a clear winner.
[5:00:50] <Mahbonk> and some other good and wonderful boyes to join the fight later on
[5:00:51] <OblivionSword1> As i always say Yakuza 0 is essentially a Majima game
[5:00:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Majima is boring if you just spam his OP bat
[5:00:59] <jorniev> SINGLEHANDEDLY
[5:01:03] <Space_Pagan> Just V
[5:01:08] <majindusto> WOOLIE, You STILL Don't Know all of Kiryu yet

[5:01:29] <@Menitta> 3 and 0 are really...similar numbers
[5:02:02] <%Holycow8498> Seeing you play Yakuza 0 makes me really want to playthrough it again
[5:02:06] <syanplague> I remember you said you tested Yakuza 3 right Woolie?
[5:02:28] <%big_laser_boss> If Majima had the Quick-change clothes it sure would be amazing
[5:02:59] <syanplague> great
[5:03:00] <%Holycow8498> Ah
[5:03:05] <Wan6Saber> why is V wearing a suit?
[5:03:10] <%Holycow8498> Watching cutscenes?
[5:03:15] <%Javaa01> @Wan6Saber Because he is committed to the bit

[5:03:26] <Iniudan> @Wan6Saber Majima
[5:03:30] <digitalslime> @Wan6Saber to be majima
[5:03:31] <Wan6Saber> @RyuShinden oh that
[5:03:54] <+Balkespower> little V needs the eyepatch to complete it
[5:03:57] <+jiggy_snipe> you have to put work in when the 2 languages are really different
[5:04:05] <Equirah> what about when it's neither? *looks at Nioh*
[5:04:07] <CookieCutter007> dattebayo

[5:05:22] <RyuShinden> "Yabai" can mean different things
[5:05:27] <rosemon5001> if V would put that on the canadian mafia would want to fight him

[5:06:31] <CookieCutter007> ANIKI ANIKI ANIKI
[5:06:32] <Wan6Saber> really?
[5:06:34] <RyuShinden> Japanese "keigo" language variant can also be hard to transliterate
[5:06:35] <jorniev> WHO CAME OUT FIRST
[5:06:40] <%Livelinne> Bro
[5:06:42] <@Menitta> Aniki isn't sibling though
[5:06:43] <OblivionSword1> Aniki is still older brother
[5:06:49] <ghoulspan> what about kyodai?
[5:06:56] <Equirah> Chat plz LUL
[5:07:00] <OblivionSword1> Aniki is just a more polite+formal onii san
[5:07:01] <SkreamnRedSkull> Is V wearing a suit?? :/
[5:07:02] <linSP> all brothers are only BIG bros
[5:07:06] <+Awkward_Cyborg> aniki is literally older brother
[5:07:14] <%BinaryFireball> ow

[5:07:15] <jorniev> one guy
[5:07:16] <%BinaryFireball> you wound me
[5:07:22] <digitalslime> Aniki is older
[5:07:23] <OblivionSword1> kyoudai does mean sibling
[5:07:31] <+MajorCrasher> damn, didn't know V was fluent in Japanese
[5:07:31] <RyuShinden> "Aniyo-e" is the more older term for sibling
[5:07:34] <OblivionSword1> and it's not just Japanese
[5:07:44] <+redux_014> What does ONI-SAN mean
[5:07:48] <arkv01> V as cool as this conversation is you're not even close to fluent
[5:07:52] <OblivionSword1> It's all asian language
[5:07:54] <+Balkespower> Have you liked the Ace Combat Soundtrack, Woolie?
[5:07:54] <kulmoth> @redux_014 older brother
[5:07:56] <Mahbonk> LUL
[5:08:00] <OblivionSword1> most of them anyway
[5:08:06] <+noajenkk> MENACING MEN
[5:08:08] <linSP> only the oldest matter, younger siblings sidelined
[5:08:09] <%Double_Tap_That> MENACING MEAN
[5:08:11] <+redux_014> Same as ANIKI then?
[5:08:12] <Mahbonk> You better watch out!
[5:08:15] <DatAsuna> Will he install another EMOTION wall?
[5:08:16] <+Balkespower> Welcome to Omikron, Motherf-

[5:08:31] <+redux_014> Ok
[5:08:49] <%Holycow8498> David Lynch is a weird being
[5:09:03] <RyuShinden> Onii-san is brother, Anee-san is sister

[5:09:51] <penitentpendant> That Man... nahnahnahnahnah That Man
[5:09:52] <%big_laser_boss> But Quick-change clothes allow you to style
[5:10:00] <majindusto> JUST PLAY IT YOUR WAY
[5:10:11] <%Asuterisuku> Yagami is neat.
[5:10:14] <%Lion_kun> People bashed on Judgement for no reason, it's one of my favorite games.
[5:10:19] <+jiggy_snipe> it's literally just calling it Yakuza 7 that bothered people
[5:10:21] <%Asuterisuku> Can't wait to get Judge Eyes on PC.
[5:10:28] <DatAsuna> I think it' s more than 8 if you count dead souls and the psp game lol
[5:10:29] <%Double_Tap_That> Double_Tap_That subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Keep on keeping on
[5:10:37] <OblivionSword1> Yagami is very different and very cool
[5:10:38] <OldManDeckardCain> not having kiryu wasn't judgement's problem tho LUL
[5:10:39] <jorniev> kasuga is great!
[5:10:41] <%Livelinne> No shit OhMyDog
[5:10:42] <Mahbonk> 4 was already a good turning point for the series by introducing new guys as well
[5:10:43] <%Lion_kun> Eyepatch Wolf said he didn't like Judge Eyes because it didn't have Kiryu haha
[5:10:45] <CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan Judge Eyes Stadia exclusive
[5:10:51] <Blank9> the best thing about judgement is it ends strong
[5:11:01] <OldManDeckardCain> the side content kinda sucks compared to normal yakuza games
[5:11:03] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[5:11:05] <+Balkespower> LUL

[5:11:52] <+Sajallday> I want more mad max and furiosa
[5:11:56] <jorniev> NICOLAS CAGE is getting a lot of time in the sun lately
[5:11:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:11:57] <Spagheddies> @Jashter18 I would honestly thank DmC for that one.
[5:11:59] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Btw, did you see Chris Hemsworth cosplaying Terry Bogard on Thor set?
[5:12:01] <RyuShinden> Netflix is the future
[5:12:01] <dukeoftime> Coof
[5:12:09] <+Sajallday> furiosa spin off sounds cool tho
[5:12:13] <+Balkespower> Have you liked the ACE COMBAT Soundtrack, Woolie?
[5:12:14] <Mahbonk> whoopsies
[5:12:16] <Wan6Saber> I do sometimes get sick of the same 50 actors, though
[5:12:17] <%Asuterisuku> Nero was always cool though.
[5:12:23] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[5:12:27] <Mahbonk> Nero was done pretty well
[5:12:30] <+jiggy_snipe> cousins yes... Kappa
[5:12:39] <Mahbonk> Raiden was a bit different for MGS2
[5:12:41] <DatAsuna> There's some fantastic old ass dubs too tho
[5:12:43] <DatAsuna> Macross, man
[5:12:45] <%Double_Tap_That> Weeaboomer
[5:12:45] <+bearwagon> LUL
[5:12:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You had the canadian dubs for most stuff
[5:12:49] <%Pillagius> "Jellyfilled ones are my favorite"
[5:12:50] <%Irridium> LUL
[5:12:50] <RyuShinden> Dubs suck, until FMA
[5:12:55] <@Menitta> nah Ace Attorney is the best though
[5:12:57] <majindusto> DUBS NEVER DID SUCK
[5:12:57] <%Asuterisuku> We grew up in the era before Funimation started doing it right.
[5:13:00] <%Holycow8498> The bebop dub
[5:13:03] <RyuShinden> Dubs suck, until FMA dub existed
[5:13:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Bebop guys
[5:13:08] <Jp_DrZaius> Vir-Gin Boomer
[5:13:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Like, seeing that Valkyrie Profile and Pokemon had the same dub list? Hilarious
[5:13:08] <OblivionSword1> modern Dubs has gotten a lot better than the old days
[5:13:08] <Halospaz117> KEEP BOOMIN BOOMER
[5:13:21] <@Menitta> I will NEVER NOT LOVE the 4Kids Yugioh Dub. Kaiba is my favorite
[5:13:27] <+Ancopro> i like when the english is different, just watch both
[5:13:27] <joshua_42> Hey the DBZ dub was good
[5:13:30] <rosabellamelantha> 4kid Kaiba is AMAZING
[5:13:31] <%Asuterisuku> I watched Dark in German.
[5:13:35] <OblivionSword1> I still watch sub mostly
[5:13:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Menitta Eric Stuart is the GOAT
[5:13:36] <Wan6Saber> Funimation was one of the first that was doing translations right
[5:13:38] <bear_breaker20> canadaian bros rise up <3
[5:13:39] <OldManDeckardCain> was it the voice of vegeta who had a casting couch? LUL
[5:13:42] <@Menitta> ITS THE BEST
[5:13:43] <majindusto> @RyuShinden Cowboy Bebop tho
[5:13:48] <%Asuterisuku> I'm with V, original language or bust.
[5:13:52] <CookieCutter007> Kung Fu Hustle Dub is the best
[5:13:57] <RyuShinden> @majindusto Ye that too
[5:14:00] <Jp_DrZaius> BUT GHOST STORIES THO
[5:14:03] <+jiggy_snipe> but eff that Ghost Stories tho
[5:14:04] <@Menitta> I will say I loathe live action dubbed
[5:14:04] <Spagheddies> What is it with Oldboy that whenever it gets touched by the west, it gets fucking butchered?
[5:14:09] <Mahbonk> holy shit Ghost Stories LUL
[5:14:11] <majindusto> Goldenboy IS THE DUB
[5:14:12] <@Menitta> that's just wrong to me
[5:14:18] <RyuShinden> Weirdly, I like the Rurouni Kenshin dub
[5:14:18] <%Holycow8498> I'll watch anime dubbed but something like a live action movie or a realistic video game like Yakuza subbed
[5:14:27] <DatAsuna> Honkai impact I go original mandarin, but Genshin I go english dub.
[5:14:31] <+Sajallday> Saiki K Dub is better then the sub, I'll die on that hill
[5:14:31] <OblivionSword1> depends on the quality really
[5:14:36] <+Ancopro> nANI
[5:14:41] <%Asuterisuku> Kanji is awful to learn.
[5:14:42] <RyuShinden> Watch J-Dorama
[5:14:43] <@Menitta> @Holycow8498 100% agreed
[5:14:44] <Tuna_Can_0> what the NANI?
[5:14:46] <Spagheddies> I will vaguely fight V on that.
[5:14:47] <OldManDeckardCain> WATCH NARUTO TO LEARN JAPANESE
[5:14:47] <Blank9> use japanese wrestling to learn the language
[5:14:49] <CookieCutter007> I learned English from gangster movies :)
[5:14:50] <jorniev> NANIII!?
[5:14:55] <RyuShinden> Watch J-Drama more
[5:14:58] <arkv01> V you sound really confident, can you actually carry on a fluent conversation?
[5:14:59] <%Livelinne> shiaAYAYA
[5:15:01] <Spagheddies> I will fight V with not a lot of enthusiasm on that.
[5:15:05] <Equirah> Vocabulary Minning
[5:15:08] <majindusto> Kenshin is a good Dub too
[5:15:10] <rafflespaddock> i learned english from videogames
[5:15:17] <jorniev> TOTALLY WATCH SPANISH SOAP OPERAS
[5:15:17] <CappuccinoGuil> I learned English through video games, had my Aunt translate the entirety of the opening scene in DMC1
[5:15:23] <prime_name> Acting and Conversations are completely different diction
[5:15:27] <halfmasks> I learned english through cartoons
[5:15:35] <Tuna_Can_0> digimon Pog
[5:15:37] <arkv01> all about the motivation bb
[5:15:38] <%Livelinne> subtitles and dictionary is your friend psaUp
[5:15:38] <%Pillagius> BTW, hilarious situation in P5: in last act when thigns go to shit there's civilian panicking and cop yelling at him.... Both voiced by same guy - Phill Reich (he also now voice of Giorno Giovana)
[5:15:41] <%Lion_kun> I've been watching anime since a teenager and while I can catch phrases, I still have a lot of trouble understanding conversations unsubbed.
[5:15:43] <+Balkespower> I learned english through Top Gear
[5:15:46] <%LordSDB> YEYEYE DIGIMON woolieCHAN
[5:15:49] <+Balkespower> and Videogames
[5:15:53] <Wan6Saber> @Balkespower LUL
[5:15:54] <DatAsuna> I know a lot of gamers who learned english just to read game menus easier. lol
[5:15:57] <RyuShinden> I learned a bit of Kansai thru Japanese comedy shows recently
[5:16:16] <%Asuterisuku> I'll say it again, screw Kanji.
[5:16:21] <+jiggy_snipe> they are acting if you will
[5:16:24] <DatAsuna> I took actual classes for japanese, but import games lit a fire under my ass for kanji
[5:16:24] <@Menitta> Kanji is the worst
[5:16:27] <%Livelinne> I learned English mostly through Rock music and YouTube
[5:16:34] <OblivionSword1> reality shows
[5:16:34] <Blank9> vtubers are mostly screeching
[5:16:34] <jorniev> COCO IS GREAT
[5:16:35] <Mahbonk> and they try to learn english themselves as well
[5:16:38] <arkv01> OOPS TROUBLES
[5:16:39] <@Menitta> HOW DOES IT WORK I DONT
[5:16:43] <+vaderxyz1970> What happened?
[5:16:44] <halfmasks> oops
[5:16:44] <CappuccinoGuil> I learned English through you, Woolie! YOU TAUGHT ME
[5:16:44] <redrins> yeah... the troubles killed it for me
[5:16:45] <Darren716> RIP Hana
[5:16:50] <RyuShinden> I learned to Kansai-ben a bit thru Japnese comedy shows, since most comedians are from Osaka
[5:16:50] <%Livelinne> shiaUGH
[5:16:53] <%Pillagius> Well... I learned english in school and was pretty basic level. I got waaaay better by watching shows and movies in english
[5:16:54] <%Lion_kun> Kiryu Coco or Kiara are good transitionals.
[5:16:56] <%Holycow8498> RIP Hana
[5:17:03] <Spagheddies> Vtubers are a good bet, because it's japanese people using the language. The best bet, though, is usually podcasts or things like that.
[5:17:04] <%ChoculaUltra> Pikamee is v bilingual too
[5:17:04] <OldManDeckardCain> CENTRAL PLANNING RUINS ALL AGAIN
[5:17:07] <RyuShinden> I learned to Kansai-ben a bit thru Japanese comedy shows, since most comedians are from Osaka
[5:17:07] <arkv01> so basically all reality tv is garbage forever
[5:17:08] <prime_name> OH NO
[5:17:09] <%Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus there is an entire generation of people whole learned Spanish off of PS2 GTA clones like Saints Row and Scarface

[5:17:36] <Spagheddies> Hey, I learned english through videogames and streamers.
[5:17:43] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm mostly joking, but youtubers helped my English get more casual
[5:17:44] <Spagheddies> And now I'm fucking bilingual.
[5:17:48] <@Menitta> Oh no
[5:17:48] <OblivionSword1> I learnt most of my vocabulary from the old SBBFP days
[5:17:48] <RyuShinden> I learned to Kansai-ben a bit thru Japanese comedy shows, since most comedians are from Osaka.

[5:19:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:19:13] <%Lion_kun> What I learned about Japanese is it's a complex language but the contents of discussions are actually very simple and repetitive. Conversations tend to repeat phrases a lot.
[5:19:22] <halfmasks> OIRA HA
[5:19:24] <Tuna_Can_0> how do you do fellow kids
[5:19:28] <RyuShinden> @ChoculaUltra The "de gozaru" thing is like, watching a renaissance period man speak LUL
