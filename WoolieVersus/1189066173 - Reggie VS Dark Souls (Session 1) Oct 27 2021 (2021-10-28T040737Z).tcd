[0:01:58] <+mechslayer71> this game is overrated imo, 3 and bloodborne are better imo. it's mostly rose tinted glasses
[0:01:59] <andre11dr> But it will look way shiter than what you played LUL

[0:02:01] <%Juriasu> you did do a good job Woolie

[0:02:05] <Treasure_Vault> No Scythe deathrun? I sleep
[0:02:06] <leith_aziz> The Souls Genre is one I'll likely always spectate instead of playing myself.
[0:02:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> DeS is less convoluted, IMO
[0:02:11] <Wahrow> Coach Woolie
[0:02:12] <forsakenpoyo> you did do good woolie
[0:02:14] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie was p solid SoulsDad/Wingman imo
[0:02:17] <$feiashtear> I can't wait for them to get the plot super wrong
[0:02:20] <+patriotrenegade> *takes Reggie's controller and removes firebombs*
[0:02:21] <+twohitgood> i think reggie is ready for DS1 after DeS.
[0:02:23] <+reknownblackcat> REGGIE VS DARK SOULS LETSGO
[0:02:24] <+askalta> dark souls 1 is more straightforward than demons
[0:02:26] <pennykettle_> This game is a cobweb
[0:02:30] <+DatAsuna> @mechslayer71 I think the "prepare to die" ads had an unintentionally terrible effect on how toxic the fanbase got with later games lol
[0:02:33] <hazeprojekt> Des is more straightfoward compared to Dark souls
[0:02:35] <+Droozy01> good coach woolie
[0:02:35] <+megaman_sentinel> u did great
[0:02:35] <SainEdge> true monkaS
[0:02:42] <kikoeru_san> Obtuse is a word
[0:02:42] <%holydeviant1> I was gonna say that they're totally gonna get lost, but the areas are so straightforward I can't think of one where you can legit lose your way
[0:02:42] <andre11dr> DeS has a lot of BS in it tho ,with all the world tendency shit
[0:02:43] <SolidusA> Guide his hips !
[0:02:45] <nxflre> no worries woolz better to go in blind
[0:02:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> In short, there will be some hip-guiding.
[0:02:48] <leith_aziz> @mechslayer71 From what I understand of the community, if its better than 2, then it'd already a good game by then
[0:02:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Woolie, your mix is lower than Reggie a li
[0:02:49] <mrdejesus34> And so much more Berserkier.
[0:02:50] <skewerstar> NGL, nice to be able to actually watch a stream of a game I've already played!
[0:02:56] <%gatorafan> expectations SET
[0:02:56] <Etymorphic> Just have fun is what most of us want I think
[0:02:57] <ScreamLord> Going back to the old channels glory days? Amazing
[0:02:58] <CatRidder> Woolie Vs Coaching
[0:03:00] <pennykettle_> Woolie also can't just be hands off if Reggie gets lost. It isn't a linear game
[0:03:01] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I am waiting to see if Pat is LURKING
[0:03:01] <Treasure_Vault> dm pat lol
[0:03:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Don't worry, I'm sure chat will politely remind you if you forget something :)
[0:03:07] <+mechslayer71> @datasuna 2 definitely, but I think bb and 3 were fine in that regard
[0:03:08] <SethYuikora> Get Zweihander, become able to wield Zweihander, profit
[0:03:09] <%Feralspirit41> Is it just me or does woolie already sound done
[0:03:11] <Wahrow> Guilty Gear Lore work for his buddy Reggie
[0:03:11] <KeiganOfAstora> Pat's totally watching
[0:03:15] <%Double_Tap_That> German Spy?
[0:03:15] <MihajloMBlood> YO LETS GOOO
[0:03:16] <brunoberserk> no one is , really LUL
[0:03:16] <andre11dr> All you need to remember is that magic is actually good in this one
[0:03:16] <Solidnick18> got the notes
[0:03:19] <memealt> the only part of dark souls I'm good at is pvp
[0:03:19] <+twohitgood> if he wants to get the questlines right then that's way more complicated but just playing the game is pretty straight forwadr.
[0:03:21] <+valentinostand> talk to pat
[0:03:21] <Darren716> Is Spy on speed dial?
[0:03:21] <kikoeru_san> @shinobiphoenix bold of you to assume he's awake
[0:03:21] <KeiganOfAstora> Put Pat on the Discord chat
[0:03:23] <pennykettle_> YEAH
[0:03:23] <+vaderxyz1970> Sun good darkness bad
[0:03:24] <%Feralspirit41> Plague on standby?
[0:03:24] <youngking_kush> Is Pat not in the chat?
[0:03:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> 700 people watching, one of them is Pat
[0:03:26] <andre11dr> Don't worry, we'll be hetw
[0:03:29] <@Solidus_113> a german?
[0:03:29] <Solidnick18> aye spy!

[0:03:35] <luckyneffy> Hey pat
[0:03:35] <%ChoculaUltra> woolieMIRIN Spy you say
[0:03:35] <hazeprojekt> patt and german spy special guest?
[0:03:35] <+DatAsuna> @mechslayer71 Eh, in any of those games, if you dare mentioned the idea of summoning, people would jump down your throat lol
[0:03:37] <ZeludeRose> this is the first ds1 stream correct?
[0:03:38] <+patriotrenegade> Pat is not in chat.
[0:03:40] <GhoulishCripple> summon the German, a lovely spy.
[0:03:41] <TheAzureOracle> Is this a spy of the german variety?
[0:03:41] <youngking_kush> A German Spy you say???
[0:03:41] <KeiganOfAstora> German perhaps?
[0:03:42] <leith_aziz> I love how much of a lorehead Woolie is like me when it coems to any game. Arkham, DMC, Guilty Gear, RPG's, etc
[0:03:42] <+Grayhammatter> a German spy
[0:03:44] <MrMatternot> A spy of Germany?
[0:03:46] <+megaman_sentinel> become giant
[0:03:47] <Afrosamasenpai> A special Kaizer
[0:03:48] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Pat said he would lurk, he admitted it on the podcast and said he has before
[0:03:51] <+BadassCyborg3000> So this means that everyone in the chat should be diligent in angrily and rudely calling out everything Woolie says about this game, like real Dark Souls fans?
[0:03:51] <+DatAsuna> official guide writer germanspy
[0:03:52] <+Droozy01> summon pat!
[0:03:53] <FlashFrame> A spy, of the German variety.

[0:03:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> The Germanic Spyon?
[0:03:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Demon espionage
[0:03:57] <%Feralspirit41> A spy that happens to be german?
[0:03:58] <%gatorafan> a Prussian Agent
[0:04:00] <Darren716> Didn't Spy literally write the strategy guide?
[0:04:02] <%Lion_kun> Can't be more wrong than Pat was lol
[0:04:11] <ScreamLord> A Kraut Infiltrator
[0:04:13] <brunoberserk> german spy , scholar of lordran
[0:04:13] <memealt> @WoolieVersus lmk if you need a pvp expert B) am considered to be the best in the game at pyromancy
[0:04:13] <MyNameIsRasus> James Bönd?
[0:04:13] <teh_Question> listen to the chat woolie, we'll never let you down
[0:04:14] <%xxMylord> DatSheffy Deutschland?
[0:04:16] <+mechslayer71> @datasuna oh that's what you mean. yeah they're all like that, I never summon anyway unless it's an npc for story stuff
[0:04:17] <+patriotrenegade> Spy wrote DS2's strategy guide i thought
[0:04:18] <robosqueeb> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[0:04:24] <enerkaizer> Oh, reggies journey through the darksouls worlds starts today? NICE!
[0:04:27] <$feiashtear> Why are people asking for Pat? He's terrible with lore.

[0:04:30] <GhoulishCripple> pat probably has a lurk account with a name like "dumbbabyman" or something to throw us off lol
[0:04:37] <+PaulKelly1> I played DS1 for the first time not too long ago so it’s still fresh for me. I made a few mistakes with a couple of things but my journey through Lordran was a good one
[0:04:37] <Solidnick18> well just try your best
[0:04:39] <Roguie> Can't wait for the amazing chest opcrotteHEHE
[0:04:42] <KeiganOfAstora> Woolie you aren't Pat
[0:04:43] <pennykettle_> DeS is a modest start, DaS is when they exploded
[0:04:50] <Vaardvark> fuck coaching, let Reggie dive in raw Squid3
[0:04:55] <ZeludeRose> horrible teleporting plague invasion pls
[0:04:55] <andre11dr> I mean he WILL lose stuff, it's impossible to see everything in this
[0:04:57] <FlashFrame> Woolie making it clear, run's scuffed boiz.
[0:04:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat's alt is like "ILoveLalafels"
[0:05:01] <+NopeBadguy> you will lose your souls
[0:05:01] <BigFingerRo> whuh, wha happen? didn't we already finish ds?
[0:05:02] <+NopeBadguy> all of them
[0:05:05] <+Droozy01> i just want summon pat for attacking purpose. lol no mercy in this dojo
[0:05:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> i think it's cute that both of you will go a bit in blind here
[0:05:07] <%Double_Tap_That> Is this console? Because PC still has hackers to this day.
[0:05:11] <brunoberserk> dont worry , woolie , were are here for you ... Kappa
[0:05:16] <%Juriasu> personally, I think first playthroughs are never going to be perfect for anyone anyway, I understand that you want to show everything since this is content though
[0:05:18] <%holydeviant1> There are three runs of Dark Souls for every player: The one where you bumblefuck your way through and make it anyway, the one with the guide, and the one for funsies.
[0:05:19] <robosqueeb> @bigfingerro that was DeS
[0:05:24] <TaylorIsGood> chat already has it 3/4ths out of the pants
[0:05:27] <leith_aziz> Is it possible to acciedently skip areas?
[0:05:27] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> zoneHype
[0:05:27] <SethYuikora> Yeah, quest breaking is crazy easy
[0:05:29] <youngking_kush> As long as Woolie us good on mechanics I'm sure they can fill in lore between Spy & Pat
[0:05:29] <memealt> @Double_Tap_That Hackers really can't do anything too terrible ngl
[0:05:30] <pennykettle_> Yea the worst that can happen is an NPC questline
[0:05:31] <Darren716> Yeah what version they playing? PC, switch?
[0:05:32] <+Goingchrisb3> We playing them souls games again
[0:05:33] <GhoulishCripple> @mynameisrasus it's "WoWstanXx13"
[0:05:34] <leith_aziz> Hopefully it doesnt get that bad
[0:05:34] <MrMatternot> You can softlock the game
[0:05:36] <%Lion_kun> No the worst that could happen is if he kills a blacksmith
[0:05:36] <Lancaster_H> hopefully it doesnt become like woolies OG demons LP handholding with Spy
[0:05:37] <prime_name> Dark Souls side quests are the worst
[0:05:40] <+DatAsuna> Luckily Dark souls is less up it's ass about sidequests than later games, but still a bit up it's own ass
[0:05:40] <zombieluxray> dont forget to level up RESISTANCE!!!!!!!
[0:05:42] <+patriotrenegade> Ugh, Siegmeyer's questline
[0:05:44] <andre11dr> @double_tap_that He probably will stay away from PVP
[0:05:44] <+Solutha> ahh shieeet
[0:05:49] <leith_aziz> Gatekeeping
[0:05:52] <Zebroneath> Or that one scene with the good boy only available after DLC.
[0:05:53] <%Juriasu> do not listen to them
[0:05:53] <%Artoo__The_Me> woolieLORE
[0:05:53] <nxflre> calling us out already lmao
[0:05:54] <%jinking79> dlc parts too
[0:05:57] <+chiazam> @holydeviant1 you forgot the fourth type, the one where you do it on autopilot
[0:05:59] <+NopeBadguy> What kind of character did Reggie play in DeS again?
[0:05:59] <pennykettle_> Mods get out your guns
[0:06:00] <robosqueeb> inb4 toothpick Kappa
[0:06:03] <+megaman_sentinel> is this the remastered
[0:06:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:06:06] <+Droozy01> no guides or tips for leveling
[0:06:07] <FlashFrame> Let Reggie play what he wants.
[0:06:09] <kikoeru_san> Don't be a pussy, buff strength /s
[0:06:11] <andre11dr> That doesn't matter
[0:06:11] <oda_flobunaga> Deprived all the way
[0:06:15] <+DatAsuna> If your game has a thousand builds, you have 999 "wrong builds" in some people's minds
[0:06:15] <MyNameIsRasus> @GhoulishCripple "LoveCliffyB"
[0:06:16] <%LastHazzerd> i like the styles people try before reading the metagame guides
[0:06:18] <EternalPunishment> Build however you want. lol

[0:06:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> No respect

[0:06:34] <andre11dr> It's a RPG play the game how you want
[0:06:34] <GhoulishCripple> @mynameisrasus that's fuckin strong
[0:06:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> No respec*

[0:22:51] <+swesterly> Aren’t yt peeps always saying “I don’t care if you’re purple”
[0:22:51] <pennykettle_> the facecam is only really an issue where it is at for this part
[0:22:54] <scrumbotime> no they need to hide the face from us for as long as possible
[0:22:57] <FlashFrame> oh man, Oblivion's CC is... oof
[0:22:57] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> SilverJammies
[0:22:58] <%thesickestzak> They should’ve added rollback to the CC
[0:23:00] <velgaduere> take ya damn time
[0:23:01] <SainEdge> it gets better with every game, but it is a slow progress LUL
[0:23:01] <+mechslayer71> @dappercadavr he played demons souls remake, which is a way better character creator, and then went to THIS LUL
[0:23:04] <+Grayhammatter> god, oblivion CC is so bad
[0:23:04] <%itzzaPIZZA> every setting must be gone through
[0:23:05] <velgaduere> episode one: character creation
[0:23:05] <$eco419> I’m fine with this
[0:23:05] <+DatAsuna> episode 0
[0:23:07] <%livlinn> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:23:07] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> I have hundreds of hours in this game but maybe 2 minutes total in the character creator. cover them with armor asap
[0:23:08] <+KennyKRool> This stream respects character creation :)
[0:23:08] <Murphio_GS> @nabs96  I've played that game bro, not that great. Maiev is nice tho
[0:23:11] <+Exicuren> Same graphics engine as well, good ol' gamebryo
[0:23:16] <Juanshonium> this is episode 0
[0:23:17] <+NopeBadguy> Have they decided on class yet?
[0:23:18] <MyNameIsRasus> this has been hilarious and it's been ten minutes
[0:23:20] <+vaderxyz1970> I love playing Jubilant Catarina because he default smiles and looks happy
[0:23:22] <Wydamn> spend 15 minutes on character face, and then wear a helmet for the rest of the game
[0:23:23] <%robosqueeb> i kind of want reg to make a completely neon dumb looking gremlin
[0:23:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Jubilant Reggarth
[0:23:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NopeBadguy nope
[0:23:25] <+kirbyautomata> the ENTIRE stream should just be CC
[0:23:27] <SethYuikora> go full caveman
[0:23:28] <+Grayhammatter> no class just yet
[0:23:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's so happy
[0:23:28] <JetpackMcQuack> fucking menus
[0:23:30] <iacus_> Dark Souls uses the same face slider middleware as Oblivion, so that explains the... issues
[0:23:31] <ulcaban> whole episode of Disco spent on the stats, and
[0:23:33] <+Bogart4321> can we move the picture in picture though
[0:23:35] <%thetunnelhomer> Cave man
[0:23:38] <+twohitgood> absolutely character creator friendly. being able to find your character is important.
[0:23:38] <+セビー> problem with fine tuning is it increases the likelihood of making a monster
[0:23:40] <%krispen_wa> waddya mean oblivion's CC is bad? just install 50 mods and be a big boobie hot elf lady. problem solved
[0:23:40] <leith_aziz> pickyStare
[0:23:41] <pennykettle_> This is certainly no Disco Elysium character creator
[0:23:41] <TigerClaws12> yo that's Peele's veteran character LUL
[0:23:44] <%chief_chongo> excessive blinking
[0:23:45] <zehdre> It's gonna be pretty funny when the game starts and Reggie sees the character.
[0:23:46] <youngking_kush> Is Jubilant Catarina is Black does this mean Siegward is Black???
[0:23:53] <pennykettle_> @zehdre LUL true
[0:23:55] <%jinking79> 5 hour on character creator 5 min later puts on a Helmet
[0:24:01] <oda_flobunaga> The Tyranny CC is sooooo Sick
[0:24:07] <+DizzyGunner> you do all this, then spend 90% of the game looking like turkey bacon
[0:24:07] <andre11dr> @youngking_kush He's not
[0:24:11] <%X2Eliah> It would be good if the character stats were hard tied to appearance sliders
[0:24:12] <+Jiggisnipe> @youngking_kush naw
[0:24:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:24:17] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:24:18] <JetpackMcQuack> 👀
[0:24:21] <pennykettle_> At least in DS1 you arent "zombie green" like DS2
[0:24:24] <velgaduere> 👀
[0:24:24] <leith_aziz> pickyStare
[0:24:24] <+lord_campbell96> The day I run a dex build is the day woolie finishes Yakuza 0
[0:24:26] <+twohitgood> @youngking_kush you can take off his helmet and he isn't.
[0:24:26] <SainEdge> 👀
[0:24:27] <+Stupid121v2> "Thank you kind sir"
[0:24:29] <Asuterisuku> Oh, so this is a Character Creation session.
[0:24:30] <andre11dr> You can look through his helmet and see his white
[0:24:31] <+KaijuUltimax> Dokapon and Reggie vs Dark Souls in the same week? Is it my birthday?
[0:24:32] <crimsonharvest> I hope they pick the start that gives the small metal kite shield, the one thats good for blocks and parries
[0:24:36] <velgaduere> @Asuterisuku indeed
[0:24:36] <SethYuikora> I want an AI that tries to recreate faces in bad character creators
[0:24:37] <%cache_22> The Patches eyeline limit.
[0:24:41] <%shoelacenbk> i guess they cant see messages? if they can then i hope they move the camera
[0:24:48] <+swesterly> Can’t see character
[0:24:54] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> @NopeBadguy I respect people trying to work with these options but you couldn't make me do it
[0:24:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Brows denser than a black hole
[0:24:57] <velgaduere> @shoelacenbk they can, but not as much anymore
[0:25:01] <elshadow7> Yooo! Reggie Souls!!
[0:25:02] <+Exicuren> @X2Eliah yeah, lke Dragon's Dogma
[0:25:05] <youngking_kush> @twohitgood Interesting. wonder why they chose that name then
[0:25:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> not even light can escape the pull of these brows
[0:25:25] <andre11dr> The women look even worse
[0:25:26] <velgaduere> """""""normal"""""""
[0:25:28] <%Prevot> better change that cam position in the actual YouTube video since we can't see what he's doing
[0:25:28] <$eco419> D:
[0:25:32] <+DeadlyPeaks> Any bets on if dokapon will affect how helpful woolie is?
[0:25:33] <SilverFaustX> zeke1 zeke2
[0:25:36] <Wydamn> youngking_kush, if you google for seigward face, he does appear to be a black man with a moustache
[0:25:38] <%mr_sups> """N O R M A L"""
[0:25:40] <%mighty_max_t> Good ol' DS character creator. Very hard to create realistic people, very easy to create monstrosities
[0:25:42] <Wydamn> I say "appears to be", because this is still the dark souls character generator.
[0:25:43] <%jinking79> woolieS woolieT
[0:25:45] <pennykettle_> Oh boy im so excited to hear that player damage groan
[0:25:47] <+Aczure> we xant see the creation of regarth!!

[0:26:04] <DapperCadavr> Did Reggie play through all of Demon Souls remake?
[0:26:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dark Souls [Perception (Trivial): Failure] You're black.
[0:26:06] <pennykettle_> true
[0:26:07] <%emMmDeeKay> !uptime
[0:26:07] <@Moobot> @emMmDeeKay WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 43 minutes and 54 seconds
[0:26:08] <Nogopharo> I feel like we only need highlights of character creation in the youtube lp
[0:26:13] <%xxMylord> Funny how the Eybrow turns white to hide it lUL
[0:26:14] <%xxMylord> LUL
[0:26:15] <%Double_Tap_That> @DeadlyPeaks He's pretty good about keeping LP canon separate, but that's off the table if Reggie brings it up.
[0:26:15] <ShineTheDiamond> Who's playing?
[0:26:16] <Murphio_GS> absolutely
[0:26:18] <andre11dr> I tried to make a cool edgy girl, it looked like shit, the only way it looks good is if you're making a white dude LUL
[0:26:20] <%X2Eliah> Dark Souls really is both Dense and Sparse
[0:26:21] <Murphio_GS> Reggie is playing
[0:26:22] <velgaduere> @CappuccinoGuil goddddddd
[0:26:23] <SethYuikora> High/Low, Low/High, High/Low
[0:26:24] <+Grayhammatter> reggie is playing
[0:26:24] <+DatAsuna> Dark souls is very unique, not always in a good way
[0:26:26] <brunoberserk> '' why he is so grey ? '' '' OMG , you cant ask someone why they are grey '' LUL
[0:26:27] <OldManDeckardCain> dark souls is a very mysterious game indeed
[0:26:28] <EternalPunishment> I've styled my character for 2 hours. lolol
[0:26:31] <+Jiggisnipe> From Software is a mysterious (weird) company
[0:26:33] <%emMmDeeKay> I got here in time, any interesting talk before the stream?
[0:26:33] <leith_aziz> Like "creative" decisions aka JoJo style or "why did they do this" decisions?
[0:26:34] <JetpackMcQuack> 800 stats, 5 that matter
[0:26:35] <MyNameIsRasus> woolieS woolieT
[0:26:36] <Deimos002> musclebobDikkbutt
[0:26:37] <ShineTheDiamond> @Murphio_GS thanks
[0:26:38] <Darren716> What're the chances of Alvina messing up Reggie?
[0:26:43] <ray9k9> We aren’t even gonna be seeing this face for 90% of the game.
[0:26:44] <elshadow7> It's called "the imperfect masterpiece" for a reason
[0:26:48] <+aBoner89> PogChamp souls!!
[0:26:55] <+Fieryone234> Hey Woolie, welcome back man! Any thoughts on SRW 30 coming out in the states!?
[0:26:57] <%emMmDeeKay> @ray9k9 that's the joke
[0:27:01] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:27:03] <pennykettle_> I spent 1.5 hours in the Fallout 76 character creator and then the game was too laggy so I refunded

[0:30:28] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[0:30:29] <SethYuikora> *always wears a helmet, so none of this matters in the end*
[0:30:32] <+aBoner89> DSL
[0:30:33] <iacus_> yeah the face cam is blocking the actual interesting thing happening lol
[0:30:33] <+BedHome> they should completly cover the face with the videoscreen, so teh visage of reggarth is a surprise reveal

[0:35:37] <+anoldtoilet> ds1 is fun no matter what you pick imo
[0:35:40] <KellBeII> Im very partial to faith builds
[0:35:42] <trigunstar26> YEAH
[0:35:46] <Chuckgofer> deep woolie
[0:35:47] <+mechslayer71> tanning from the waist down huh NotLikeThis
[0:35:56] <SilverFaustX> magic is broken
[0:36:03] <+blink289> pyro is special tho
[0:36:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Started DEX, became mageman
[0:36:08] <+BedHome> but also no one does magic so its cool to see
[0:36:09] <nabs96> Can't wait for Reggie to meet Solaire and Sieg
[0:36:11] <zehdre> ds1 is honestly a lote more forgiving since you get more level than demon's
[0:36:12] <QueequegTheater> Pat's wrong, faith is still super viable in DS2, you just can't go faith ONLY.  Pair it with strength/dex
[0:36:13] <pennykettle_> Go for a RES build
[0:36:14] <velgaduere> full resistance build let's go
[0:36:17] <elshadow7> Deprived's legit the most fun class to pick when replaying, probably a bit too much for a first time pick
[0:36:18] <+anoldtoilet> lmfao
[0:36:23] <+askalta> Pyro gives more room for correction
[0:36:25] <%Double_Tap_That> Pyro for SL1
[0:36:26] <KeiganOfAstora> Warrior if you're not sure
[0:36:26] <%Lion_kun> A hybrid build would be harder to do in DS1 and magic was nerfed compared to DES
[0:36:28] <joyfulbastion> Oh boy, this is going to be great.
[0:36:30] <+anoldtoilet> dont let em level resistance plz
[0:36:31] <joshujostar> comfy timez are back
[0:36:31] <+aBoner89> Pyro is really good too
[0:36:38] <user_naim> Pick weapon, devolve into bastard pyromancy.
[0:36:39] <+choopercabra> But you can always grind
[0:36:47] <%X2Eliah> Lets be real, Deprived is the best first experience
[0:36:50] <%Josef_Stryker> BANDIT
[0:36:55] <iacus_> pyro is a fairly easy start. And it's worth it to spec on pyromancies anyway
[0:36:56] <crimsonharvest> Warrior's shield is one of the best, most flexible sheield
[0:36:57] <NotAnOfficer> warrior is the best for 1st timers in general
[0:36:59] <justcallmebobplease> Fingers crossed for Master Key, I want to see Reggie go some busted-ass first play, that's the best!
[0:37:05] <teh_Question> BEST SHIELD IN THE GAME
[0:37:05] <%Lion_kun> Remember when Woolie picked Pyro and then proceeded to never use Pyromancies haha
[0:37:07] <%Josef_Stryker> Warrior's a good pick
[0:37:15] <MyNameIsRasus> He's Ryu
[0:37:16] <+aBoner89> vineGoblinpls Deprived and Master Key gang vineGoblinpls
[0:37:18] <+anoldtoilet> yea starting with a 100percent shield is pretty good
[0:37:25] <JetpackMcQuack> i like to hit things
[0:37:26] <Murphio_GS> Warrior and Pyromancer are good for starting out
[0:37:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggarth the Centrist
[0:37:34] <KeiganOfAstora> Strength and Dex up to 16 to use all beginner weapons
[0:37:36] <%Mrthefro> Aw fuck gotta clear my afternoon LUL
[0:37:36] <iacus_> pyromancies are basically free. the most versatile branch of magic
[0:37:38] <QueequegTheater> @Lion_kun I often go pyro purely for the good starting stats and just pick up Power Within
[0:37:38] <+anoldtoilet> but you dont need 100percent. honestly some of the partial block shields are real good
[0:37:39] <%X2Eliah> @anoldtoilet if you want to use shields, not necessary
[0:37:39] <guiltyboya> May I suggest a zweihander/Claymore build? But I love the Claymore, so that's me
[0:37:46] <elshadow7> The tank
[0:37:46] <zehdre> r e s i s t a n c e
[0:37:49] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Claymore is my fav too
[0:37:51] <EternalPunishment> this run about to be good. lolol
[0:37:52] <%shoelacenbk> knight is pretty good for beginners
[0:37:52] <Toni_Master43> @guiltyboya Claymore gang
[0:37:54] <pennykettle_> block gang, fuck dodging
[0:37:55] <%thetunnelhomer> Pretty good faith
[0:37:55] <%Juriasu> gotta pump that RES
[0:37:56] <crimsonharvest> knight s l o w thought, be sure you want to trudge

[0:38:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> I blanked out, we going LUCK build right
[0:38:20] <+Shishi1205> Endurance the best stat in the game
[0:38:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> SPEAR
[0:38:22] <MyNameIsRasus> @Pookiedaexzile as soon as they pick a class
[0:38:25] <%Double_Tap_That> @phd_in_thuggery Hell yeah!
[0:38:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what does resistance do
[0:38:27] <brunoberserk> also knight starts with the fat roll
[0:38:29] <Monkeyweed21> Wearing heavy armor and just tanking the hits is viable in Dark Souls 1
[0:38:29] <%xxMylord> Basic Longsword is the best weapon!
[0:38:32] <justcallmebobplease> Endurance is such a great stat.
[0:38:35] <+Shishi1205> The friend of the Strength builds

[0:38:55] <velgaduere> END is the best stat in DS1 for sure
[0:38:57] <+patriotrenegade> Isnt VIT health and equipment load?
[0:38:59] <%shoelacenbk> Res build? please?
[0:39:01] <+anoldtoilet> @cobalt_phoenix_ increases all your defenses a little bit + resistances to bleed, poison, etc. it doesnt really do a lot compared to other stats so its considered the dump stat of this game
[0:39:05] <teh_Question> END best stat
[0:39:05] <youngking_kush> Yeah END is busted
[0:39:05] <+Shishi1205> @patriotrenegade not here
[0:39:06] <scrumbotime> My first class was Bandit I loved Axe
[0:39:08] <KellBeII> End. isn't terribly important since there are two rings that increase equipe load by 70%.

[0:39:55] <elshadow7> @xxMylord and you never got poisoned...right?
[0:39:55] <justcallmebobplease> If Resistance was DS2's Adaptability to give you a Dodgerolling state, DS1 would have my favorite stat spread.

[0:40:55] <SethYuikora> is the unique kick in DS1 with the scimitar?
[0:40:58] <+askalta> this game is dex souls
[0:41:04] <velgaduere> I usually start as Bandit
[0:41:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:41:05] <teh_Question> @SethYuikora ye
[0:41:09] <Johannen> I am glad i did not missed this
[0:41:13] <+heros_lucatero> weskCorn
[0:41:16] <+セビー> pyro coz a bunch of guides recommended it at the time
[0:41:19] <justcallmebobplease> MASTER KEY
[0:41:23] <Solidnick18> thief is alright
[0:41:23] <+anoldtoilet> Has Master Key
[0:41:23] <+the_hidden_yeti> I picked Thief first and I thought they were the only class that could backstab b/c of the Bandit Knife's description
[0:41:25] <%Double_Tap_That> Sequence breaker
[0:41:25] <+Grayhammatter> schmovement
[0:41:26] <%bread_assassin> Great Scythe is way OP in this game
[0:41:28] <+Jiggisnipe> naw I was a thief
[0:41:30] <+Shishi1205> @セビー yeah pyro was like super recomended
[0:41:32] <Darren716> Don't pick a character with the MK
[0:41:32] <+FennecZephyr> The master key also fucks with progression
[0:41:34] <+anoldtoilet> yeah its the sequence break class
[0:41:35] <MrKtan> DARK SOULS HYPE
[0:41:35] <DapperCadavr> @bread_assassin it's amazing
[0:41:39] <+aBoner89> ohhh I forgot thief starts with the Key PogChamp
[0:41:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, starts with Master Key that can fuck up progression
[0:41:41] <CatRidder> THE PARRY
[0:41:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> get the BACK
[0:41:42] <%robosqueeb> that and parrys
[0:41:42] <justcallmebobplease> M a s t e r - K e y
[0:41:46] <Treasure_Vault> backstab and parry
[0:41:46] <+セビー> thief was also what i rolled with often for the free key
[0:41:47] <Dannzzyy> Pryo or bust.
[0:41:48] <SethYuikora> backstabbing is easy in this game though
[0:41:49] <+FennecZephyr> Theif is the expert class
[0:41:49] <%X2Eliah> THI4F
[0:41:52] <%Double_Tap_That> Backstab and ripostes
[0:41:53] <%ZeludeRose> pls dont let him pick the master key lol
[0:41:56] <+askalta> master key
[0:41:58] <%robosqueeb> its a good parry tho
[0:41:59] <+PleasantlyGrimm> small shields are good for parry, so i always pick thief personally
[0:41:59] <topleybird> master key is for second playthroughs, i think
[0:42:00] <pennykettle_> we stan the pendant in this house
[0:42:03] <derap41> best class parry backstab and key
[0:42:03] <@Solidus_113> master key is not recommended for a 1st time play
[0:42:04] <Johannen> Master Key goes straight to the garbage pile
[0:42:05] <royb2> yooooo reggiesouls
[0:42:10] <%mr_sups> Master Key is not worth for first run. Great for repeats
[0:42:12] <teh_Question> reggie's gonna need to git gud at parrying
[0:42:14] <QueequegTheater> You can fucking parry the world in DS1
[0:42:20] <+askalta> master key if you don't wanna slow roll half the game
[0:42:21] <%robosqueeb> also dat master key
[0:42:24] <Majestic_Flof> do et
[0:42:24] <%X2Eliah> What was the useless ring item?
[0:42:26] <michlarv> put all your stats into resistance then you are immune to every type of damage
[0:42:27] <%phd_in_thuggery> I think I might have started my first playthrough on Thief..... NotLikeThis
[0:42:29] <Treasure_Vault> But you also played Demon Souls
[0:42:31] <oda_flobunaga> Also master key is a bad idea
[0:42:31] <pennykettle_> @X2Eliah Pendant
[0:42:32] <+aBoner89> @Solidus_113 but how will he get the Black Knight Halberd? Kappa
[0:42:34] <Johannen> Heavy Clank all the way for me)
[0:42:34] <%DashXero> Thief in this game is pretty hype.
[0:42:35] <%Wydamn> Master Key is good if you're already familiar with the maps and item placements
[0:42:35] <JetpackMcQuack> more to learn
[0:42:39] <%X2Eliah> @pennykettle_ oki
[0:42:41] <velgaduere> Master Key's cool, but that's bait for beginners
[0:42:43] <+Shishi1205> Yeah thief and not parrying = rough start
[0:42:43] <+Exicuren> "trust me bro, I know where I'm going", gts lost half of the gam build
[0:42:44] <guiltyboya> Deprived, with the Humble Pendant  Kappa
[0:42:47] <+beansoup> yeah master key should only be second playthrough only IMO
[0:42:51] <leith_aziz> So he can speedrun
[0:42:51] <youngking_kush> Gotta go Old Witch's Ring
[0:42:54] <%mr_sups> Sequence break class
[0:42:55] <SheefEatsBeef> YEEAH STRENGTH
[0:43:00] <+anoldtoilet> master key is fun for a first play too though
[0:43:06] <+Exicuren> UNGA AND BUNGA
[0:43:09] <+anoldtoilet> because you run into areas you arent supposed to be in and die
[0:43:09] <niddron> That ol' battle axe
[0:43:12] <@Solidus_113> BANDIT. SOUL LEVEL 99.
[0:43:14] <%shoelacenbk> bandit is kinda gopd tbh, spider shield is pog
[0:43:14] <KellBeII> Str. is by far the easiest build for a new player.
[0:43:16] <+aBoner89> vineGoblinpls Unga vineGoblinpls
[0:43:19] <Treasure_Vault> UNGA, and if necessary BUNGA
[0:43:19] <+anoldtoilet> bandit is pretty great yea
[0:43:20] <pennykettle_> master key means the depths and blight town are optional LUL
[0:43:21] <Solidnick18> chop 🪓
[0:43:22] <+Exicuren> BIG NUMBER GO UP
[0:43:23] <LegitBarnacleBoy> UNGA BUNGA
[0:43:28] <Johannen> Lets go Heavy Clonker and Bonker
[0:43:29] <garsedj> good shield
[0:43:29] <+セビー> key lets you explore off the recommended path, which is its own fun
[0:43:32] <%Double_Tap_That> GIANTS GIANTS GIANTS
[0:43:34] <JetpackMcQuack> become guts
[0:43:36] <AppleBerryKitty> uhhh is he playing this for real? if so I hope he turns online OFF
[0:43:37] <%ZeludeRose> @anoldtoilet it's different for an audience tho, i don't wanna see reggie getting confused & lost for 3 hours
[0:43:38] <Pookiedaexzile> We taking shit
[0:43:43] <EternalPunishment> You'll find that shield early game.
[0:43:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @AppleBerryKitty he has countermeasures
[0:43:49] <CoupleAGuys> Become Bazuzo
[0:43:50] <Johannen> What version are they playing?
[0:43:50] <velgaduere> Bandit is a great starting class
[0:43:52] <elshadow7> Boo hunter
[0:43:53] <garsedj> A COOL GUY
[0:43:54] <pennykettle_> @AppleBerryKitty Woolie has a lagswitch or something ready so they can play online but stop invaders
[0:43:54] <SheefEatsBeef> who the fuck picks hunter
[0:43:55] <SethYuikora> @AppleBerryKitty They're running watchdog for cheaters
[0:43:56] <+anoldtoilet> VoteYea  zelude i agree i think

[0:44:04] <%phd_in_thuggery> total NEEEERRRRRRD
[0:44:06] <+anoldtoilet> the game allows for a lot of different routes even without master key
[0:44:08] <+megaman_sentinel> wow start with spider shield
[0:44:09] <+anoldtoilet> so its chill
[0:44:11] <%phd_in_thuggery> BOW NERD
[0:44:13] <KellBeII> Is this on PC?
[0:44:15] <garsedj> THE HUNTER IS A COOL GUY, WOOLIE!
[0:44:16] <+セビー> Honestly, cant go wrong with warrior, bandit, or pyro
[0:44:17] <+Grayhammatter> bow nerd

[0:44:24] <MyNameIsRasus> GON??
[0:44:28] <velgaduere> this class is meh
[0:44:29] <+Shishi1205> I've never seen anyone go hunter

[0:44:33] <derap41> Bow for real underrated
[0:44:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Bowner :)
[0:44:36] <AppleBerryKitty> Ok thanks yall. Cause I've seen way too many nonsense out the years of this game.
[0:44:36] <+mundanelotus> big sword boi
[0:44:38] <topleybird> I did hunter on my first playthrough. I rarely used bows, tho
[0:44:43] <youngking_kush> Hunter is the way to go IMO
[0:44:43] <Solidnick18> boooooo sorcerer
[0:44:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CatRidder
[0:44:44] <DudeDern> Leather PANTS

[0:44:54] <+DatAsuna> The class that makes chat shit it's pants
[0:44:57] <brunoberserk> neeeeeeeeeerd
[0:44:59] <%Double_Tap_That> Magic man
[0:44:59] <+choopercabra> Bows are good for pulling enemies.
[0:45:02] <elshadow7> Starting classes are only relevant for like the first 10 levels anyways, by that point you've probably started specing into whatever you want
[0:45:03] <Toni_Master43> @leith_aziz Souls games get people talking for better or worse
[0:45:05] <+Exicuren> kiaaa don't touch me build
[0:45:05] <%phd_in_thuggery> wew 1200 people watching
[0:45:06] <GeoGio3> DEprived chad
[0:45:09] <+anoldtoilet> magic is strong as fuck in a world of shit
[0:45:09] <topleybird> pew pew
[0:45:12] <Pillagius> Wait... isn't that exactly same look Woolie had for his character back when he played DS1 for the first time? (not like there are many good options to have, though...)
[0:45:13] <%robosqueeb> limited spells to shoot
[0:45:13] <+twohitgood> magic is pretty strong in DS1
[0:45:15] <+Darky04> busted
[0:45:16] <darkbrightdemon> i played as a hunter on my 1st playthrough
[0:45:19] <SethYuikora> except Kalameet
[0:45:21] <%glaciomaniak> such an exciting day for adventure
[0:45:21] <Pookiedaexzile> But wah bout the next one tho
[0:45:22] <+anoldtoilet> but you have very low defense and cant really wear good armor
[0:45:24] <JetpackMcQuack> good until it's not
[0:45:25] <+anoldtoilet> so if the boss does hit you, you die
[0:45:26] <justcallmebobplease> BOY HOWDY are Miracles busted in DS1
[0:45:27] <%Lion_kun> Not as busted as Des
[0:45:28] <+twohitgood> but it's like d&d: you have a limited number of casts between rests.
[0:45:31] <Arqartur0> I'm glad that, Despite being a Souls game, it feels chill, even if it is on character creation
[0:45:33] <AbnormalVoid> Miracles are still really good in DS1
[0:45:34] <+DatAsuna> I liked miracles in demon's, magic in ds1, but in 1 not so much
[0:45:34] <+megaman_sentinel> busted a d broken
[0:45:36] <+Exicuren> R1, R1, R1 build
[0:45:39] <velgaduere> man I wanna go to Dragon School

[0:45:47] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Ok, people say this about every fandom according to the internet, so I cant say I give a shit pickyTired
[0:45:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Isn't it
[0:45:53] <%Double_Tap_That> Also uses Spell Slots as opposed to MP.
[0:45:56] <Pookiedaexzile> 3 person shooter no cover mechanic
[0:45:57] <Monkeyweed21> @Pillagius souls character creators are not known for their ability to make certain ethnicties well
[0:46:03] <NotAnOfficer> it`s a zoner
[0:46:05] <grimeything> knowwaddamean?
[0:46:09] <Treasure_Vault> It's better to be a wizard second playthrough
[0:46:09] <theamazingaesoup> Yeah, spells have limited uses as opposed to MP

[0:48:10] <@Solidus_113> it's not aoe
[0:48:10] <%Double_Tap_That> Firebomb time!
[0:48:10] <SethYuikora> I think we have our class
[0:48:10] <MihajloMBlood> REGGIE NOOOOO
[0:48:10] <michlarv> imagine if reggie ends up with toothpick/shield combo too lol
[0:48:11] <TheAzureOracle> DO IT REGGIE
[0:48:11] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[0:48:13] <+patriotrenegade> its not AOE
[0:48:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie: "You remember I played Demon's Souls right?"
[0:48:15] <+Grayhammatter> fire bomb build LETS GO
[0:48:16] <user_naim> You play Ryu right?
[0:48:16] <+Exicuren> Power within = UNGA more BUNGA mode
[0:48:16] <Pookiedaexzile> HIT DAT SHIT SON
[0:48:17] <%mr_sups> FIREBOMB!? woolieKICKDAD
[0:48:17] <tenshi_q> fire bob build lesgo
[0:48:18] <+Jiggisnipe> LESSSGOOO RETURN OF FIREBOMB
[0:48:19] <+Tuffty> The light in Reggie's eyes says it all
[0:48:19] <okramv> Reggie gonna pick Pyro
[0:48:21] <+Shishi1205> @anoldtoilet thats the casting item tho
[0:48:23] <@Solidus_113> you throw it like a firebomb
[0:48:25] <+Rafraud> I'd think of it more as a snowball
[0:48:31] <pennykettle_> I also started Pryo
[0:48:34] <Johannen> Instead of putting souls into your stats you would have to spend some on Pyro Items and Spells
[0:48:35] <Pillagius> @Monkeyweed21 lol, yeah :D
[0:48:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Dats dat shit son
[0:48:40] <%ozzrabbit> I think Reggie’s hooked on the Pyromancer
[0:48:46] <andre11dr> Because Pat made you
[0:48:52] <Gregorhasjoined> 12 resistance though???
[0:48:57] <+megaman_sentinel> it's just free
[0:48:58] <Puhff> Paige also went Pyro iirc
[0:49:01] <AnthroMetal> the gear is also great
[0:49:01] <%notsoy> hobomancer
[0:49:03] <derap41> Dressed in trash
[0:49:04] <velgaduere> Grandma Swamp build
[0:49:05] <pennykettle_> Anyone want to make bets on how long it takes before he hits an NPC?
[0:49:05] <+anoldtoilet> yeah but in ds1 spell scaling only comes off the item, not stats. in ds3 pyromancy did have stat requirements i thought
[0:49:08] <%dreadedcthulhu> reggie peepin the drip
[0:49:08] <brunoberserk> Reggie of the SWAMP
[0:49:10] <%Juriasu> even if you don't pick pyromancer you can still start using pyromancy further in
[0:49:11] <%Josef_Stryker> IIRC that Pyro Set also provides good resistance no?
[0:49:12] <+vaderxyz1970> Strait out of blightown
[0:49:14] <andre11dr> Yeah Pyro is great
[0:49:17] <%mr_sups> RYU
[0:49:17] <Viewtiful_Rose> Get Reggie to do cleric for the memes
[0:49:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> Swamp Dweller Reggarth
[0:49:21] <+twohitgood> i started pyro for my first game, too.
[0:49:21] <+DatAsuna> easily the most picked yeah
[0:49:22] <+Darky04> go Deprived Kappa
[0:49:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolies trying to throw him off the truth
[0:49:23] <+Shishi1205> Poison rs yeah?
[0:49:24] <+Grayhammatter> straight outta the woodworks
[0:49:31] <elshadow7> Why that does matter? xD
[0:49:32] <SolidusA> you have my bow... and my pew pew
[0:49:34] <garsedj> cleric best starter!
[0:49:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> deprived woolieGASM
[0:49:35] <%Artoo__The_Me> HAIR CUT
[0:49:36] <+Exicuren> stats and level make that class really good
[0:49:37] <Viewtiful_Rose> Reggie strikes me as a cleric in real life
[0:49:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> Picking Pyromancer is also NOT the only way to get pyromancy.
[0:49:40] <andre11dr> Deprived dose have it's uses
[0:49:40] <+anoldtoilet> miracles are pretty sick in this game as well.
[0:49:41] <didipackums1> Swamp Rat Reginald
[0:49:42] <AnthroMetal> @Josef_Stryker yea, i think it might have the highest base resistance stats
[0:49:42] <pennykettle_> filthy clerics
[0:49:42] <%ozzrabbit> Raise your hand if you started with Pyromancer in your first play though
[0:49:43] <+セビー> also getting access of pyro for other classes takes some time
[0:49:46] <+anoldtoilet> all casting is real strong in ds1
[0:49:47] <%Dakuu75> Question: After you beat the game once... is the next run "NG+1" or just "NG+" ? (what would you call it?)
[0:49:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Father Reggarth
[0:49:50] <Johannen> But those LIGHTING BOLTS THOU

[0:50:18] <pyjama_day> oh man I just got here. Looking forward to seeing Reggie playing
[0:50:18] <%Irridium> @Dakuu75 I think it's Just NG+ and every new one after that just adds more pluses.
[0:50:19] <Viewtiful_Rose> Cleric cleric cleric 🙏🏻
[0:50:20] <garsedj> \[T]/
[0:50:22] <%Double_Tap_That> Estus is gonna be a game-changer for Reggie.
[0:50:22] <+Jiggisnipe> @Dakuu75 NG+
[0:50:22] <pennykettle_> Wrath of GOD
[0:50:23] <+CobaItDysprosium> What the fuck did I just tune into LETS GO.
[0:50:26] <niddron> bless
[0:50:26] <derap41> Also you're already in a covenant
[0:50:29] <andre11dr> And this has actual good miracles
[0:50:32] <%Dapper_Cactuar> didn't faith builds get nerfed into the ground after the first few months?
[0:50:36] <+セビー> oh geez, i just realised.. the estus system is gonna be a shock
[0:50:39] <Zetsubera> retroi3Stonehand
[0:50:40] <+DatAsuna> it's not as busted as faith in other games, but it will still get you where you wanna go
[0:50:41] <KellBeII> lightning spear does like 400+ damage and can be acquired right after the first boss.
[0:50:42] <Hellvis92> WOTG is kinda OP
[0:50:43] <Monkeyweed21> @Dapper_Cactuar that was DS2
[0:50:44] <niddron> go with god!

[1:07:27] <pennykettle_> A world so sad you can't even kys to escape
[1:07:28] <%holydeviant1> Canonically: When you stop playing, you go hollow.
[1:07:41] <leith_aziz> So respawning costs you your soul
[1:07:42] <%Dakuu75> it's your homeward bone -1
[1:07:48] <user_naim> @abelincoln_catpuncher infinitely quoteable
[1:07:48] <leith_aziz> Hmm pickyThink
[1:07:48] <StrikingEarth> hide that int stat

[1:07:58] <+eanscrale> common is an understatement
[1:08:00] <%Irridium> no intelligence only stupid
[1:08:03] <resloxxx> will timer
[1:08:14] <andre11dr> Like everyone is undead
[1:08:14] <teh_Question> all hollows are undead, not all undead are hollows
[1:08:28] <StrikingEarth> i want a big doofus to light the fire
[1:08:28] <pyjama_day> ^
[1:08:34] <Johannen> That extends to real life players losing thier will to continue the playthrouh)
[1:08:34] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> then you go to Hollow loser jail
[1:08:36] <leith_aziz> Is Hollow like dying enough times?
[1:08:38] <+Rafraud> Zombie and Level 2 Zombie
[1:08:40] <velgaduere> yeah, there's undead, but then there's UNDEAD undead
[1:08:45] <pennykettle_> Until Dark Souls 3 when the writers forget what Hollow means and talking NPCs claim to be hollow
[1:08:45] <+wynnewake> @leith_aziz giving up
[1:08:49] <+Rafraud> Hollow is giving up
[1:08:51] <SheefEatsBeef> lmao
[1:08:52] <+BedHome> it dying enough times you stop caring and stop playing the game
[1:08:52] <andre11dr> Hollows is what happens when Undead lose their soul
[1:08:56] <teh_Question> @leith_aziz it's like losing your sense of self
[1:08:57] <%X2Eliah> Hollow seems more based on time spent + repeated failure
[1:08:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @leith_aziz when you give up and have nothing else to live for
[1:09:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Hallow is a back down on lofe
[1:09:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:09:07] <%tank7013> @leith_aziz Hollowing is basically becoming a generic zombie. It happens when you lose the will to live
[1:09:11] <leith_aziz> @abelincoln_catpuncher I see then pickyThink
[1:09:11] <+BedHome> if you quit part way through playing the game? congrats! YOU just hollowed out
[1:09:12] <velgaduere> Reggie is 👀 at that spell
[1:09:23] <+Rafraud> Hollow can also be caused by completing your purpose and having nothing to do
[1:09:24] <DedlokPM> @leith_aziz hollow is basically dying, losing your mind and all motivation/will to continue
[1:09:31] <+DannySteele> going hollow is when you rage quit the game and don't come back
[1:09:36] <%X2Eliah> Never use Pyro
[1:09:38] <ArvidOnFire> Hollowing is what happens when someone left clicks your NFT
[1:09:40] <%Irridium> Hollow is what you feel when you're working retail/fast food
[1:09:42] <+BedHome> yeah its not necceserily caised by dying, you could never die and still go hollow
[1:09:47] <leith_aziz> Don't mind me. Im just a guy who loves being a lorehead. More I learn, more im intruiged pickyThink
[1:09:48] <+BedHome> going hollow is losing your purpose and cares
[1:09:50] <andre11dr> In DeS  ,Souls where literally your mind juice, thus losing your soul means you go insane
[1:10:22] <SheefEatsBeef> scaling and requirements baby
[1:10:23] <%emMmDeeKay> Going hollow is leaving the game unfinished
[1:10:46] <DedlokPM> @BedHome well you have to die to even becoming an undead. You have to also lose your Humanity and Souls, which also involves dying.
[1:10:49] <djblue_shift> did paige ever beat ringed city?
[1:10:57] <andre11dr> Technically your caracter only goes Hollow if you Rage Quit
[1:11:01] <%Seancicle> Seancicle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Oy vey es mir. Reggie, we took a look at the Dokapon LP per your recommendation. Dirons-nous comment ressentir  plaît. En anglais, don't make me choose between my friends!
[1:11:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @djblue_shift nope lol
[1:11:08] <+Shishi1205> oh yeah I have paiges ds3 run yet to watch
[1:11:14] <LaNoktaTempesto> what's the in-game effect of humanity? never have figured that out
[1:11:17] <+Sullen_Walrus> @djblue_shift i think she just has gael left
[1:11:25] <+Shishi1205> @LaNoktaTempesto A lot of things
[1:11:29] <+InvisiblessedReptile> YES, Dark Souls!
[1:11:31] <peachy996> She's in the Ringed City
[1:11:33] <pennykettle_> @LaNoktaTempesto can summon, increased item discovery chance
[1:11:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> I just got 3 months of Stadia Pro free, for having YouTube Premium. I want a refund.
[1:11:41] <%debrv> Also: UPGRADE KEEP THAT FUCKING HILT FOR LATER!! I promise you, it will be worth it.
[1:11:43] <DrkJP520> Humanity increases drop rate, I believe
[1:11:45] <peachy996> I don't think she beat it yet
[1:11:50] <BattlePastry> @LaNoktaTempesto increases item drop chance, gives you extra armour vs all types of damage, increased curse resistance etc
[1:11:52] <+Shishi1205> @debrv meme?
[1:11:57] <andre11dr> @lanoktatempesto Lots of things, better discovery is one of them
[1:11:57] <nxflre> @GeneralSCPatton lol I got 3 months of Discord Nitro
[1:11:57] <%Dakuu75> I've never been able to make a poison build work in these games
[1:11:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @lanoktatempesto raised def and curse resistance, increases drop rate and raises damage for Chaos weapons up t to 15
[1:12:03] <+twohitgood> divine is great for a very specific task.
[1:12:12] <RedaiRmex> @debrv yeh what do you mean?
[1:12:13] <+askalta> ignore all shield fans. 2h only
[1:12:14] <%debrv> @debrv Nope.
[1:12:14] <GeoGio3> I'm so hyped for this playthrough
[1:12:15] <%xxMylord> @debrv you can turn it into artorias sword
[1:12:17] <+Javaa01> Also, no inventory carry weight max
[1:12:29] <+Shishi1205> ooooh yeah straight sword
[1:12:33] <LaNoktaTempesto> cool, so it is indeed generally worth restoring when you get the chance
[1:12:36] <EternalPunishment> When I played I didn't have this much info. I just got the uchi early. Then GG XP
[1:12:38] <+DatAsuna> "and i took that personally"
[1:12:43] <%Dakuu75> fuck shields. play it like bloodborne lol
[1:12:47] <syncronard> oh yeah, I forgot about boss soul weapons in this game
[1:12:48] <SheefEatsBeef> light medium and FAT FUCK
[1:12:56] <+Grayhammatter> FAT
[1:12:58] <velgaduere> 4 types of rolls in this game, technically
[1:13:00] <SethYuikora> FAT ROLL
[1:13:03] <taeko_ohnuki> just say fat woolie
[1:13:04] <velgaduere> but he'll never see the fastest roll
[1:13:04] <%debrv> @debrv The most ballin' Sword ever.
[1:13:05] <pennykettle_> and then you have "literally unable to roll"
[1:13:12] <andre11dr> Oh man i can't wait to one shot Reggie with Dark Bead and like a true pro Kappa
[1:13:13] <+Javaa01> You just stumble at max
[1:13:13] <%tank7013> You just kinda stumble forward
[1:13:14] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> and can't run either lol
[1:13:15] <+Shishi1205> fast roll
[1:13:16] <%shoelacenbk> technically 5 rolls
[1:13:17] <$Rumbutt> NINJA FLIP
[1:13:21] <@Solidus_113> the goop stumble
[1:13:23] <pennykettle_> I was fat roll my entire playthrough because I didnt know
[1:13:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> and the NINJA FLIP
[1:13:25] <enerkaizer> *Undertaker enters the chat*
[1:13:25] <+aBoner89> just keep rollin rollin rollin
[1:13:28] <+Idziman> fred durst?
[1:13:29] <%EyeFarted> 50-75. 75-100. 100+
[1:13:29] <DrkJP520> Equip load also affects movement speed
[1:13:30] <Toni_Master43> P O I S E
[1:13:30] <%Irridium> don't need a roll when you can just tank every hit and flatten the enemy
[1:13:35] <dundore77> big poise for big bois
[1:13:39] <EternalPunishment> FaT ROLL :(
[1:13:39] <peachy996> alright pardner you know what time it is
[1:13:43] <%shoelacenbk> ninja, fast, med, fat, no roll
[1:13:47] <%X2Eliah> Is item discovery just luck?
[1:13:50] <Gregorhasjoined> POISEBOIS
[1:13:51] <%Dakuu75> oh but, this game actually has poise
[1:13:53] <+Shishi1205> @Irridium the tarkus/havel/giant strat
[1:13:56] <pennykettle_> poise boys
[1:13:58] <+insomniacandroid> is this the very start?
[1:14:00] <@Solidus_113> big poise bois
[1:14:03] <+twohitgood> poise boiz!
[1:14:06] <andre11dr> This is the one game where you can just sit there and block and tank
[1:14:07] <zehdre> That's wrong
[1:14:08] <SheefEatsBeef> fuck you didnt hurt
[1:14:11] <+Grayhammatter> big poise bois
[1:14:11] <syncronard> poise boiz
[1:14:14] <Darren716> At this rate Reggie won't even be out of the Asylum by the end of episode 1
[1:14:14] <SilverFaustX> hodor
[1:14:20] <AnthroMetal> tarkus!
[1:14:23] <+Solutha> thats stability tho
[1:14:23] <@Solidus_113> it's super armour
[1:14:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> not true Woolie lol it's for trading blows
[1:14:24] <+hax_metatron> hax_metatron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Woolie sherpa'ing Dark Souls. I shed a tear.
[1:14:25] <pennykettle_> @Darren716 based
[1:14:26] <%tank7013> Big untruths
[1:14:27] <+Vivaciousx3> ds1 poise is more like hyper armor
[1:14:27] <%Prevot> poise boise
[1:14:27] <Roll4Tarrasque> Reggie playing dark souls??? AWESOME
[1:14:27] <BattlePastry> blocking is determined by shield stability not poise
[1:14:27] <Pookiedaexzile> [But Dat Roll do}
[1:14:28] <%X2Eliah> Just say it's resistance to being interrupted
[1:14:28] <LaNoktaTempesto> @insomniacandroid yes
[1:14:29] <darkfilled> hi chat, so is Reggie playing?
[1:14:29] <+WizoSavage> Reggie is tiny
[1:14:30] <GeoGio3> you can take a hit without blocking with poise
[1:14:32] <%Lion_kun> Poise is so busted in DS1
[1:14:34] <thelovingfool> super armor
[1:14:34] <%debrv> @Irridium UNGA BUNGA Strat. AKA, the most fun without sorceries and Miracles.
[1:14:35] <Pookiedaexzile> But Dat Roll Doe
[1:14:36] <+twohitgood> poise is your ability to armor through attacks and keep swinging.
[1:14:36] <locobo98> Let's goooo
[1:14:37] <MyNameIsRasus> It's super armor
[1:14:39] <%sneekypotato> more like hyper armor
[1:14:40] <+Count_Graagh> POISE. MATTERS!
[1:14:40] <+Shishi1205> Blocking = shield stability
[1:14:43] <teh_Question> TANK THRU THE WORLD
[1:14:44] <+Jiggisnipe> poise is super armor
[1:14:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's super armor @Woolie
[1:14:48] <+Shishi1205> Poise not flinching
[1:14:50] <Johannen> Poise is block? Wut? Can we get an expert's on this?
[1:14:51] <+mechslayer71> pouse us whether you flinch without having shield up.
[1:14:52] <Toni_Master43> Poise is only good in this game
[1:14:54] <+favadem> there is shield stabiliy and poise, they are two different things
[1:15:01] <+twohitgood> you can also keep drinking with high poise.
[1:15:01] <zehdre> Actually I wonder what Woolie's wrong counter will be compared to Pat's
[1:15:08] <%Irridium> @debrv Big club solve many problem
[1:15:09] <%Dakuu75> Don't need Poise if you just dodge everything~ Kappa
[1:15:09] <%RyTYoung> Tanking za world, tanking za rulez SingsMic
[1:15:09] <+Jiggisnipe> I can't believe Woolie isn't using a fighting game analogy when it's perfect right now Kappa
[1:15:09] <%X2Eliah> Get hit, need poise. Dodge hit, skip poise.
[1:15:11] <user_naim> Little poise for brittle bois
[1:15:16] <andre11dr> With enough poise you don't get any knockback, you can just sit there and nothing happens
[1:15:22] <pennykettle_> :tf:
[1:15:24] <SethYuikora> not fun
[1:15:24] <Timarkot> Shouldn't he explain things as they go on?

[1:15:34] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr face fucking everything except comand grabs
[1:15:36] <andre11dr> In DS3 poise was just hiper armour
[1:15:39] <AnthroMetal> RESISTANCE BASE STAT
[1:15:40] <justcallmebobplease> It was the rawest, when someone fucked up and stacked it.
[1:15:42] <%debrv> @Irridium BIG SWORD MAKE MEAN THING NOT EXIST

[1:15:53] <%X2Eliah> Oh
[1:15:54] <+cdrom321> @zehdre Woolie is a guide, but not an expert like Pat was claiming to be.
[1:15:58] <+mikesapartment> fill dat bosom up

[1:16:00] <%Double_Tap_That> tity
[1:16:00] <%X2Eliah> So humanity, lorewise, is "boob ghosts"
[1:16:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bosom means Tity
[1:16:04] <Qsmash_> it means tity
[1:16:08] <%hax_metatron> Oh boy Reggie, get that notepad down
[1:16:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1452876605185998851?t=s4kcX_jYto2dS6pItMmhRg&s=19
[1:16:08] <+Grayhammatter> tity
[1:16:08] <%RyTYoung> tity
[1:16:09] <+reknownblackcat> I should just play Dark Souls 3 though
[1:16:10] <+tempestzephyr> Bosom Kreygasm
[1:16:14] <%shoelacenbk> tity
[1:16:18] <%Dakuu75> thank you chat. lol
[1:16:18] <%kyh9> Eat that humanity
[1:16:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> titty
[1:16:20] <aura_00> tity
[1:16:27] <afronooch> tity
[1:16:32] <%hax_metatron> Are they reading chat?
[1:16:50] <andre11dr> It's unclear what humanity even is,it's kinda like a creature but it's also part of you
[1:16:52] <%Irridium> tity
[1:16:54] <%Darmanimon> too much humanity gives you a bigger bosom, therefore humanity is HRT HahaThink
[1:16:56] <MyNameIsRasus> tity
[1:16:57] <velgaduere> @hax_metatron Reggie isn't, and Woolie certainly isn't right now
[1:16:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @hax_metatron woolie says he isn't but he's already responded to chat multiple times lol
[1:16:59] <AnthroMetal> @hax_metatron nah, recording for LP
[1:17:00] <%livlinn> humanity is in booba oldgrayLove
[1:17:02] <%Double_Tap_That> Humanity also provides a degree of damage resistance.
[1:17:06] <%hax_metatron> YES thank you god
[1:17:15] <donstylo> Humanity also increases item drorate i think but i'm not sure anymore.
[1:17:16] <SheefEatsBeef> sipp
[1:17:17] <user_naim> I liked the poise/def weapon arts in DS3. L2 to tank even [that thing in carthus]
[1:17:17] <shakespearo> @Darmanimon that's what the H stands for
[1:17:19] <+Grayhammatter> more sips of the sunny D
[1:17:20] <+meermadon> Oh shit DS already? Glad I got here for the start
[1:17:20] <+Rasheedt> @darmanimon LUL
[1:17:21] <+Shishi1205> Does the dmg reduction capt at 10 humanity?
[1:17:22] <Treasure_Vault> If it sounds confusing, it's because it is
[1:17:22] <pennykettle_> humanity is a fragment of the dark soul, so humans sort of have 2 souls
[1:17:23] <+Jiggisnipe> sip sip sip
[1:17:23] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> SilverCozy
[1:17:30] <zehdre> @Shishi1205 Nope.
[1:17:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Wouldn't you want to explain some of these concepts later when they become relevant?
[1:17:38] <AnthroMetal> also, more soft humanity = more chaos
[1:17:39] <+Shishi1205> was that item discovery then?
[1:17:39] <pyjama_day> @donstylo it says so at the bottom left right now, it does indeed
[1:17:41] <+blink289> oh god he doesnt know about about the sunny d
[1:17:41] <Darren716> I feel Woolie is over explaining every mechanic before Reggie even starts
[1:17:51] <pennykettle_> my man hasnt seen a bonfire yet
[1:17:52] <SheefEatsBeef> he'll figure it out
[1:17:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @NRhyme
[1:17:54] <zehdre> Yeah item discovery and chaos scaling caps at 10, defense goes up to 99.
[1:17:59] <%RyTYoung> @pennykettle_ LUL
[1:18:00] <+Jiggisnipe> he's just explaining stats
[1:18:09] <+Shishi1205> ok thanks
[1:18:11] <$Invlux> tbh all this info needs to be frontloaded
[1:18:11] <user_naim> What’s a bonfire?
[1:18:13] <dundore77> you also can get humanity just by fighting things
[1:18:15] <%Dakuu75> Woolie is fighting Reggie's mind-goblins right now
[1:18:15] <%Darmanimon> it goes from 00 to AA to BB all the way to double D
[1:18:15] <brunoberserk> ''humanity is a mistake '' ´GWYN
[1:18:18] <djblue_shift> yeah kindling could've come up when they get the rite but it's all good
[1:18:19] <andre11dr> Also as we find later, humanity is not specifically linked to human, it can wonder around like a being
[1:18:23] <+セビー> i think the important thing with not being hollow for reggie will be for npc invasions
[1:18:32] <SilverFaustX> woolie talking for 90min, reggie playin for 1 min
[1:18:37] <%hax_metatron> Basically, forget that Humanity means "Humanity", and think of it as a stat
[1:18:44] <velgaduere> hard humanity: on you
[1:18:47] <velgaduere> soft humanity: in you
[1:18:50] <MyNameIsDango> This is way too much info before you've even pressed a button. He'll be lucky to remember 1/10th of this.
[1:18:56] <Treasure_Vault> It's kind of like HOPE
[1:18:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Its the oppisite of how fucking works
[1:19:00] <%X2Eliah> moist humanity: leaking out of you
[1:19:00] <%vVAstrAVv> idk if we should explain the entire game to reggie before even asylum demon
[1:19:12] <DrkJP520> hadouken!
[1:19:13] <%holydeviant1> Allow Woolie to dump here, he can call back to it as needed.
[1:19:18] <leith_aziz> @Darren716 Woolie right now is basically emphasising my worst fear when I want to discuss GG lore and not have them confused, as I want them to go "oh this is interesting pickyPog "
[1:19:20] <velgaduere> y'all act like Woolie's not gonna repeat any of this information
[1:19:20] <%Darmanimon> he's played Demon's Souls, its fine
[1:19:23] <zehdre> Woolie's doing the same he did in DeS chat.
[1:19:27] <%shoelacenbk> you can honestly play the entire game without ever being human or kindling
[1:19:34] <Johannen> Flame bad...big scary
[1:19:45] <%X2Eliah> "8 uses" between rests, or like ever?
[1:19:52] <%Darmanimon> between rests
[1:19:53] <pennykettle_> @X2Eliah rests or dying
[1:19:55] <velgaduere> if you're new to Reggie VS Souls, welcome. like it or not, this is how this goes
[1:20:00] <%holydeviant1> @shoelacenbk Alternatively, you could challenge yourself to basically stay human whenever possible (harder) and kindle each bonfire to max (easier?)
[1:20:03] <user_naim> Things that aren’t on fire, would like to stay that way.
[1:20:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @x2eliah when you rest, like d&d
[1:20:09] <%X2Eliah> @pennykettle_ Okay, so a lot like dnd wizarding
[1:20:14] <%Dakuu75> how's the durability in this game? does shit break fast?
[1:20:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Rolling up
[1:20:16] <@Menitta> Where they at
[1:20:21] <%Darmanimon> the first room
[1:20:21] <andre11dr> Fire is also wierd in this universe, like it comes from the soul ,but undead are weak to it
[1:20:21] <emptyantics> I wish we could’ve seen the dank ass swamps
[1:20:21] <@Menitta> just got here
[1:20:22] <pennykettle_> @Menitta the first room
[1:20:23] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Start.
[1:20:26] <@Menitta> ah sick
[1:20:28] <leith_aziz> Nothing done yet
[1:20:28] <+askalta> VoHiYo
[1:20:34] <%johnny_gogo> i missed some of it has he died yet?
[1:20:35] <pyjama_day> @Dakuu75 mostly fine. You just have to be wary with the 'washing pole' weapon and other katanas
[1:20:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dakuu75 unless you're using a katana, you almost never worry about it
[1:20:38] <+セビー> I dont think theres an fps bug on dura in 1
[1:20:39] <shotguncrucifix> the explanation is good for viewers new to ds. not everyone watching is a lore nerd
[1:20:40] <NRhyme> All caps messages get deleted? That's silly.
[1:20:42] <%holydeviant1> @Dakuu75 Not really. It takes a while, its usually a resource for special weapons and their cool shit
[1:20:50] <Johannen> @Dakuu75 Unless they are weabu swords or glass weapons you dont need to worry about durability
[1:20:52] <%Darmanimon> man he didn't take the pendant smh
[1:20:54] <Pookiedaexzile> The roll vs Poise dilemma
[1:20:54] <leith_aziz> @johnny_gogo Reggie hasnt stepped 1 meter forward
[1:20:56] <%Dakuu75> <3

[1:22:09] <+Grayhammatter> hops!
[1:22:12] <+xerotwo> SHORT HOPS
[1:22:14] <andre11dr> Jumpin is wierd in this
[1:22:14] <+Jiggisnipe> it's a hurdle/hop
[1:22:14] <pennykettle_> I think you can change to analog stick click in the remaster
[1:22:14] <+vascillia> are they gonna play the game
[1:22:17] <+xerotwo> WE KOF NOW
[1:22:20] <+twohitgood> if this is remastered, i think you can remap that.
[1:22:20] <leith_aziz> oh you can jump..kinda pickyPog
[1:22:21] <Johannen> I thought they added the Stick option to jump in the remaster
[1:22:23] <%Double_Tap_That> It's not great
[1:22:23] <%RyTYoung> This ain't DES gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed
[1:22:24] <andre11dr> I like the DS2 jumping more
[1:22:25] <+Sperbus> I left for like 20 minutes and they're still in the cell huh
[1:22:25] <+Shishi1205> The mario bullshit you have to do in some parts is assa
[1:22:25] <%haitakaa> @vascillia nope
[1:22:31] <%Prevot> terrible input
[1:22:35] <KeiganOfAstora> You can change it to L3
[1:22:36] <+セビー> fuck the stick click jumping
[1:22:37] <%ZweihanderSteve> when the taglibe said "prepare to die" they didnt mean the fights NotLikeThis
[1:22:39] <Pookiedaexzile> No one say the words borne or blood for the full LP
[1:22:40] <Shinji_Ifrit> you can also set it to r3 if this is remastered @WoolieVersus
[1:22:41] <KeiganOfAstora> Please change it to L4
[1:22:43] <KeiganOfAstora> L3
[1:22:44] <SheefEatsBeef> nice jab
[1:22:47] <+vascillia> @haitakaa kinda figured, may as well explain every boss in here while we're at it XD
[1:22:47] <%shoelacenbk> this game has bullshit platforming sections
[1:22:50] <andre11dr> Jumpin sucks in DS1
[1:22:51] <Shinji_Ifrit> L3*
[1:22:53] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr Bro on ds2 you hop like a fucking bunny you go past a lot of things bc of that distance increase
[1:22:53] <+megaman_sentinel> left stick click 4life
[1:22:54] <+Suneater_Jerome> you can make every jump if you believe hard enough
[1:22:54] <Darren716> @sperbus welcome to Woolievs
[1:22:55] <%Darmanimon> this is training mode, y'all wanting them to go online immediately
[1:22:58] <KeiganOfAstora> First time being wrong @WoolieVersus
[1:23:02] <peachy996> It's more fitting to cll it a Leap
[1:23:02] <Solidnick18> kick
[1:23:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DEMON ON THE ROOF
[1:23:04] <pennykettle_> bib kix
[1:23:05] <+mikesapartment> guard break
[1:23:06] <%Darmanimon> give them time to learn some combos smh
[1:23:06] <leith_aziz> The Spartan kick
[1:23:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Like a smash
[1:23:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:23:12] <%X2Eliah> Kick is best move
[1:23:15] <velgaduere> guard break/push
[1:23:16] <Johannen> Superior Move
[1:23:21] <andre11dr> Im so glad Elden Ring just has Sekiro jumping
[1:23:24] <shotguncrucifix> !uptime
[1:23:24] <@Moobot> @shotguncrucifix WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 41 minutes
[1:23:24] <+Stupid121v2> dog on da demon on da roof
[1:23:26] <%haitakaa> I forgot every mechanic besides backstab and parry
[1:23:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so much wrong info on poise lol
[1:23:31] <%Double_Tap_That> Woolie, you're thinking of Stability, not Poise.
[1:23:33] <+RemedyofRevenge> what the undead doin?
[1:23:35] <donstylo> the roll at the end of a jump is always nerve wracking.
[1:23:36] <garsedj> poise isn't balance!
[1:23:37] <pennykettle_> its fine chat chill
[1:23:43] <%Dakuu75> that other dude is still on the roof... just watching this "Maybe this undead is farther gone than I thought..."
[1:23:45] <+askalta> shields are not more important than weapons
[1:23:47] <zehdre> He'll correct it later
[1:23:48] <%X2Eliah> Lol chat it doesnt matter
[1:23:57] <+Shishi1205> @Dakuu75 he already got merced
[1:23:58] <@Menitta> this is the remaster ye?
[1:24:01] <+vascillia> reggie should have to take a test on every mechanic and boss in this game before he's allowed to leave this fucking room
[1:24:03] <Toni_Master43> @Menitta YES
[1:24:04] <%Double_Tap_That> @Menitta ye
[1:24:04] <%Darmanimon> chat drop your shields
[1:24:05] <+Shishi1205> yeah remaster
[1:24:10] <%haitakaa> the unlock pivot backstep backstab is ultimate tech
[1:24:13] <leith_aziz> Backstep needing stamina seems a bit overboard, but I havent seen its utility yet pickyShrug
[1:24:14] <velgaduere> @vascillia it's only fair
[1:24:17] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:24:19] <+twohitgood> two handing means 50% more strength.
[1:24:20] <+lootthevandal> woolie will figure it out later its fiiiine
[1:24:28] <$Invlux> you know what i mean?
[1:24:29] <%X2Eliah> Remember that Reggie hasnt equipped his pyromancy
[1:24:36] <%shoelacenbk> @leith_aziz yeah its pretty underused
[1:24:40] <%X2Eliah> pyromango
[1:24:41] <+Jiggisnipe> here comes Parry God Reggie
[1:24:42] <+mikesapartment> this one has the good timing
[1:24:44] <Gregorhasjoined> If only this was Sekiro, where EVERYTHING is parry countered
[1:24:48] <pennykettle_> Reggie doesnt *have* his pyromancy. thats how the tutorial works
[1:24:50] <zanzibarian_hamster> oh are we still in the prison cell?
[1:24:52] <%holydeviant1> @leith_aziz Backstep has the most distance IIRC, and it's useful for most attacks
[1:24:56] <+TheFrancix> yooo pyrochads gang
[1:25:00] <pyjama_day> @leith_aziz backstep isnt that useful i this sadly. In DS2 it actually gets some invincibility though, making its follow up attacks super potent
[1:25:01] <%EyeFarted> Same button dash and jump is better than L3. Fite me losers.
[1:25:02] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz It makes more sense in DS2 where back stepping has invincibility
[1:25:04] <%Darmanimon> yeah he doesn't have the pyromancy flame yet
[1:25:04] <pyjama_day> *in
[1:25:08] <+vascillia> Reggie must score 800 or higher on the Written portion of woolie's Dark Souls test before leaving this fucking room
[1:25:11] <+cubbywolf> idk just trust your instinct reggie
[1:25:13] <+Shishi1205> BAckstep attacks do exist too
[1:25:16] <+Stupid121v2> time to schmoove
[1:25:17] <%RyTYoung> @eyefarted ye
[1:25:19] <+Jiggisnipe> now touch that ass
[1:25:22] <Johannen> The moment the enemy weapon hand would touch you you parry that shiz
[1:25:22] <brunoberserk> GET IN THE RING
[1:25:24] <%Darmanimon> end of youtube episode one right here LUL
[1:25:25] <+mikesapartment> you need the orange soap to rate here
[1:25:26] <pennykettle_> you need an item for it yea?
[1:25:27] <+Grayhammatter> gtime to schmoove

[1:25:38] <+セビー> gj on the info woolz
[1:25:38] <+MooseIsGoose> You have to have the item
[1:25:41] <andre11dr> In this back stepping ain't that useful
[1:25:44] <Gregorhasjoined> Prisoner!
[1:25:46] <%tank7013> Oh, I always thought you needed the stone to rate in 1
[1:25:48] <+Stupid121v2> talk some silent shit
[1:25:51] <+Mistheart101> you can mod in fortnite dances for gestures, if you really want
[1:25:55] <pennykettle_> @tank7013 changed in the remaster I bet
[1:25:56] <AnthroMetal> point down
[1:25:57] <shotguncrucifix> dark souls needs warzone gestures
[1:26:00] <Gregorhasjoined> Hit em with the PointDown
[1:26:04] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:26:04] <%X2Eliah> biiiig butts
[1:26:04] <+vascillia> I don't ever want to hear woolie complain about overbearing tutorial sections ever after making reggie and us sit through 25min of this lmao
[1:26:07] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:26:11] <AnthroMetal> well, what is it?
[1:26:12] <Gregorhasjoined> Oh DS1, never change

[1:36:53] <andre11dr> Oh ,don't worry I'm making a caracter on PC right now
[1:37:02] <Johannen> Poise is withstanding hits without blocking, Stability is holding your shit with a block/shield

[1:47:56] <emptyantics> POOTY TANG
[1:47:59] <NRhyme> Imagine going out on a life-defining adventure, a tale prophesied by family and fate, just to die and be worth only a handful of souls.
[1:48:01] <+Mistheart101> @Dakuu75 and then saint peter goes "a cool 100 lol"
[1:48:07] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[1:48:09] <%ozzrabbit> Tang?
[1:48:12] <Viewtiful_Rose> Sunny D is pretty gross as an adult
[1:48:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Kool-aid?

[1:48:27] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Orange Tang

[1:48:30] <Viewtiful_Rose> What kinda soup
[1:48:35] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Watching this is great man
[1:48:37] <velgaduere> Sunny D is just cleaner with sugar added to it

[1:48:43] <Ner234> LUL
[1:48:44] <%Darmanimon> @Menitta RIP Mr Lahey BibleThump
[1:48:45] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Sunny D was never tasty
[1:48:53] <andre11dr> It's literally liquid fire ,and probably tastes like shit by the way they drink it
[1:48:59] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Either pumpkin or green if mushroom
[1:49:02] <+Shady_Zaku> I had Sunny D again recently after not having it for years, still kicks ass!
[1:49:03] <pennykettle_> and look, sitting didnt reset the boulder because that would make no sense, thanks DS3

[1:49:06] <derap41> @andre11dr Just like sunny D
[1:49:07] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp 20x
[1:49:09] <velgaduere> the most important button in the game
[1:49:19] <Viewtiful_Rose> If it’s liquid fire must be pretty smoky
[1:49:29] <pennykettle_> Best skybox in the series
[1:49:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> also closing the game when invaded by a twink build is perfectly acceptable
[1:49:37] <@Menitta> was the lighting always this white in the original
[1:49:50] <%Irridium> remember the prop estus flask that came with the dark souls 3 official guide and it looked like a butt plug
[1:49:52] <%Artoo__The_Me> Yesnt
[1:49:53] <%tank7013> I wonder if Woolie is gonna tell him about the jump attack glitch
[1:49:56] <pennykettle_> @Menitta I think the size of the ambient light was smaller
[1:50:01] <baijieli> boss time
[1:50:03] <Viewtiful_Rose> Dark souls on the og Xbox was so dark I hated it
[1:50:07] <pyjama_day> @CaptainPileDriver absolutely. Though sometimes they give you stuff for being brave
[1:50:09] <%Darmanimon> yo chat, HumbleBundle just put out a Sonic bundle, but it has Sonic Forces in it so I dunno if I wanna get it LUL
[1:50:20] <+Bitscreed> @Irridium And it wasn't even hollow right? It was just a solid lump of plastic IIRC.
[1:50:20] <alexyaoilover> Clenching?
[1:50:24] <+SenorCounter> light attack
[1:50:25] <NRhyme> @Irridium Wasn't it an empty flask, too? so it was just a dumb, green buttplug?

[2:06:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> @MyNameIsRasus bonfire-chan is a waifu if you're not a coward
[2:06:50] <alroy909> bonefire is the best level up waifu
[2:06:50] <+Mistheart101> go Giant Dad
[2:06:54] <andre11dr> Good this version of the bonfire sucks
[2:06:54] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Worry Reggie
[2:06:55] <Darren716> Hot trash
[2:06:56] <+Shady_Zaku> What's wrong with the remaster?
[2:06:59] <+Shishi1205> a bit of dex but dont tell anyone you level that bitch
[2:07:00] <%sonofthedeepsouth> You must worry
[2:07:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bonfire-chan
[2:07:04] <andre11dr> Why did they fuck it up like that
[2:07:09] <MyNameIsRasus> @CappuccinoGuil fair enough, i was a fool
[2:07:14] <oda_flobunaga> Bonfire chan AKA Bonfigussy
[2:07:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Irridium absolutely fact. Bonfire chan forever.
[2:07:16] <emptyantics> STR CHADS WYA
[2:07:23] <iacus_> nothing is wrong with the remaster afaik. just that some shaders change the look of certain areas/items
[2:07:26] <niddron> DS2 had the best hub OST,
[2:07:27] <NRhyme> DS1 bonfires weren't literally fires, they were made so in the remaster to fight DS3
[2:07:32] <+Shishi1205> Attunement slots
[2:07:33] <toomuchsnarf> Love the dump stat
[2:07:37] <+Vigonept> str easy mode for babbys
[2:07:39] <Dopamien> resistance only build Kappa
[2:07:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> 14 gives you a new slot
[2:07:41] <+Darky04> do a Giantdad build
[2:07:43] <%Order_of_Mystery> bonfire chan is always there for you, and never makes you mash through dialogue to level
[2:07:49] <+Bitscreed> @niddron I love the Majula theme.
[2:07:54] <%Taylorton147> moonlight sword build or sun bro build
[2:07:58] <+Shady_Zaku> @nrhyme fight?
[2:08:01] <+Mistheart101> @Order_of_Mystery bearer-- seek-- seek-- lest--
[2:08:02] <+Shishi1205> god stat
[2:08:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> dex and endurance are the best options
[2:08:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Stamina by 2 amazing
[2:08:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> strength and vit are second
[2:08:18] <velgaduere> godlike stat
[2:08:21] <NRhyme> @Shady_Zaku Meant fit.
[2:08:23] <tachi_gigas> pump resistance
[2:08:26] <andre11dr> I hope Reggie commits to Pyromancy ,Chaos Fire ball in soooo good
[2:08:28] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Soft cap
[2:08:37] <+RemedyofRevenge> 20 and 40 are the soft and hard caps
[2:08:37] <infiltratian> man I love this game
[2:08:54] <+FxyDEV> what a welcome surprise
[2:09:05] <niddron> @bitscreed damn right it is, everybody that knows, knows that Majula theme is the best
[2:09:18] <emptyantics> 99 Luck run here we come sumitoLIZIQ
[2:09:28] <Scorchfield> has Reggie said what sort of build he wants to go for or is he still figuring it out?
[2:09:28] <%brandt_connors> Full resistance build
[2:09:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie said End or die
[2:09:36] <NRhyme> You... gotta have faith, faith, faith!
[2:09:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> attunement is spell casting increase
[2:09:41] <iacus_> ZWEI BUILD! ZWEI BUILD!
[2:09:45] <RedaiRmex> @bitscreed i love Majula, but i honestly like this firelink shrine music the most.
[2:09:46] <knyttstories> FeelsBadMan No luck stat in DS1
[2:09:50] <andre11dr> Majula has the best theme, to bad that everyone in that place is boring or sucks
[2:09:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:09:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Pyromancy
[2:09:53] <GeoGio3> STR is the way
[2:09:54] <+Shishi1205> no
[2:09:56] <+liquidzr0> uh oh
[2:09:59] <olm46> Just attunement slots
[2:10:02] <+FxyDEV> dex makes you cast it faster
[2:10:03] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Magic or pyro?
[2:10:03] <%brandt_connors> cast speed with dex
[2:10:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pyromancy scales with the glove upgrade
[2:10:05] <Pookiedaexzile> It don't need it
[2:10:05] <glass_marcus> unless you wanna fire punch
[2:10:06] <GeoGio3> you can level your hand
[2:10:07] <velgaduere> END is the answer
[2:10:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> pyro is just your glove
[2:10:08] <+Vigonept> pyro knight lets go
[2:10:08] <crunchington001> "Oh!" says Woolie, feeling a sense of dread creep in
[2:10:08] <%Irridium> fire hot
[2:10:08] <+RemedyofRevenge> scales when you upgrade the hand
[2:10:10] <+anoldtoilet> no it scales with money, you have to upgrade the flame
[2:10:11] <%holydeviant1> Pyro only scales off a single pece of equipment
[2:10:11] <Treasure_Vault> You can upgrade the glove
[2:10:12] <Dopamien> pyro asks for money
[2:10:12] <+Solutha> It scales with the flame
[2:10:15] <CatRidder> pyro doesnt care
[2:10:16] <andre11dr> Pyro ,is just get the better spells
[2:10:16] <Pookiedaexzile> You are FireBender
[2:10:17] <+eanscrale> well it scales with the flame
[2:10:18] <TenraiDaze> + spell cast speed at 35dex and up
[2:10:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> you make your glove stronger then fire get bigger
[2:10:22] <velgaduere> yeyeyeyeye
[2:10:23] <Rellim80> Pyro Scales with Glove
[2:10:23] <%Order_of_Mystery> the Chad DS1 Pyromancer
[2:10:29] <+Mistheart101> pyro, much like thog, dont care
[2:10:32] <Treasure_Vault> END is good to start
[2:10:32] <+Shishi1205> Already making a good choice
[2:10:35] <JairusHopesItWorks> dex makes you cast faster
[2:10:37] <+Bitscreed> @RedaiRmex Firelink shrine music is beautiful and chill but something about Majula's music and Majula itself does it more for me, personally speaking ofc.
[2:10:38] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pyro scales with money lol
[2:10:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'd go dex to 10
[2:10:44] <underFreddy> think he needs to put everything in resistance
[2:10:44] <Pookiedaexzile> DEX
[2:10:47] <Treasure_Vault> You could put your first 30 points in endurance and be fine
[2:10:52] <emptyantics> @canadiananimatorguy sumitoKEK sumitoKEK
[2:10:53] <$hattrick61> Pyro is the Cuno of ds
[2:11:01] <Rellim80> I got your soft cap, bb
[2:11:05] <Yung_FckUp> 10 DEX but dont tell anyone you leveled that shit
[2:11:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Attunement gives you a slot at 14
[2:11:09] <%mr_sups> @hattrick61 It does not care
[2:11:14] <%Taylorton147> whats wolly using to come up with these
[2:11:15] <andre11dr> I really don't like DS2 Pyro where they made it scale with magic and faith, that sucked

[2:13:42] <dundore77> again if it comes down to it theres nothing wrong with just doing a bit of off screen grinding if you mess up your stats it only impacts what level the multiplayer attacks you at.
[2:13:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> WØØlie

[2:17:21] <pennykettle_> In the remaster, does the screen still turn harsh green when you step one foot into blighttown
[2:17:23] <+セビー> idk.. just waiting out the end of the world at the shrine doesnt sound so bad
[2:17:24] <Archmortal> @andre11dr DS2 goes even harder with it by trying to convince YOU to be one with the guy at the statue, telling you right at the start how you're gonna pointlessly die over and over
[2:17:24] <+fgcmorad> Good ol' Blightown
[2:17:26] <Rellim80> I mean kick.

[2:45:38] <Dave_VD> Brilliant game design is how you know where to go
[2:45:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> @セビー Agreed. Also, that's what I like about this place. It's got the most things to find out of all the home bases in these games.
[2:45:47] <Arqartur0> that is a sick executioner's hood
[2:45:47] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's like Demon's Souls, except instead of worlds it's just connected areas
[2:45:47] <andre11dr> You know what chat
[2:45:50] <Qsmash_> Reggie should probably go back and fight those skeletons
[2:45:52] <MetroidSlayerP7> I feel so sorry for firekeepers.  that's a shitty job.

[2:49:04] <DSD24> Can you eat in there Rickert?
[2:49:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Nobody tell him how many Guts there are
[2:49:06] <oda_flobunaga> They really need to do a game where you are on a boat and never get off it
[2:49:06] <GeoGio3> 5 whole games of not really berserk, what more oculd you ask
[2:49:07] <Parapattern> You HVEN'T READ BERSERK

[2:49:13] <Johannen> Have you heard about our lord and savior BERSERK?
[2:49:20] <+liquidzr0> @OldManDeckardCain I've heard he's done nothing wrong Kappa
[2:49:22] <pennykettle_> Isn't the bloodborne logo the berserk symbol with 2 extra lines
[2:49:24] <SmortyPuffin> do they like berserk? i can't tell
[2:49:25] <+Darky04> I know you answered this question but what do you think about Berserk ending?
[2:49:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @jdebss I got my brother to do that once and I almost cried from laughing so hard lol
[2:49:30] <Arisato_II> Rejected
[2:49:31] <andre11dr> The sequels got even more nuts with the "GUYS WE REALLY LIKED BERSERK"
[2:49:37] <Jontman42> seems pretty fine honestly
[2:49:44] <+JDebss> @abelincoln_catpuncher LUL
[2:49:45] <DSD24> A lot more chill then Sad Boy upstairs
[2:49:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @pennykettle_ opposite, took off 2 lines
[2:49:47] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> "How's the weather? Shitty. Always."
[2:49:51] <royb2> It's actually an improvement
[2:50:07] <AvroEltz> "Hes got a lot to say" "Ive got nothing to say"
[2:50:10] <Murphio_GS> Magic blacksmith
[2:50:16] <Johannen> Polite Reggie says goodbye what a goodboi
[2:50:30] <Darren716> This guy the smartest person in the series, just lock yourself in a hole and smith
[2:50:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> Plus, it needs 12 Dex, which you don't have
[2:50:40] <Arisato_II> "So guys we did a little grinding off-screen"
[2:50:44] <+Grayhammatter> needs 12 dex
[2:50:48] <+Vigonept> fuck estocs
[2:50:49] <DSD24> Estoc is great in games
[2:50:49] <Klefth> Pokey poke
[2:50:53] <%Josef_Stryker> Bestoc
[2:51:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> @Arisato_II woolieGASM
[2:51:09] <Johannen> But what about that baller sword?
[2:51:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> y'all remember Dark Estocs before the nerf? Pepperridge farm remembers
[2:51:16] <zzNamttamzz> tiny stick
[2:51:20] <+セビー> dex faith, nice
[2:51:20] <Klefth> Not so bestoc in 1, but fuck that shit in 2 and 3 lol
[2:51:26] <AzaroRequiem> unironically waiting for TheWoolieWatcher to show up eventually lol
[2:51:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @johannen best sword
[2:51:32] <DSD24> Reggie should go full on Giant Dad
[2:51:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's complicated in a different way
[2:51:38] <%jepupu> I think my first playthrough in DS1 was a dex buddy with an estoc & dagger
[2:51:42] <%ozzrabbit> Hah! The weapon that infuriated DS3 players in the early days of the game!
[2:51:43] <+Sir_Louis> and the right colour!
[2:51:48] <DSD24> Chaos Zweihander lets goo
[2:51:48] <%tank7013> Don't let him use it in DS3 or else people will lose their minds and accuse Reggie of looking up the meta
[2:51:49] <pennykettle_> I love the upgrade system in DS1. I just don't like the boss weapon system
[2:51:55] <+SWFanatic> Reggie Will Hammer it Out
[2:52:01] <+fgcmorad> DeS is more obtuse imo
[2:52:07] <oda_flobunaga> @AzaroRequiem it would have to be TheReggieRegarder
[2:52:11] <pyjama_day> @pennykettle_ agreed tbh
[2:52:19] <ArvidOnFire> Using anything other than Claymore PogO
[2:52:31] <GeoGio3> +15 is so nice
[2:52:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the Zweihander is so amazing in this game
[2:52:41] <Grev_stalmon> I would love it if Reggie ended up getting the Father Mask
[2:52:43] <DSD24> Isn't Claymore super busted in this game?
[2:52:50] <@Solidus_113> +15 Great Scythe
[2:52:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dsd24 pretty insane for quality builds yeah
[2:52:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> @DSD24 zweiheinder
[2:53:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 this is how to play
[2:53:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> or the lifehunt scythe
[2:53:23] <DSD24> But the Balder Swag Sword tho
[2:53:23] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> great scythe was my go to
[2:53:27] <ArvidOnFire> Isn't Claymore faster than Zwei?
[2:53:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> man its hitting me again that reggie is playing dark souls for the first time. how cool is that PogChamp
[2:53:34] <Johannen> Chonky and Slim
[2:53:37] <Archmortal> Honestly Claymore, Zweihander, and Great Scythe are all better in DS1 than almost any other weapon is in the rest of the series
[2:53:44] <total_overkill> @ArvidOnFire yes, but i think it has a different moveset?
[2:53:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @arvidonfire yeah but Zweihander has a busted ass moveset
[2:53:53] <ManfredA> great scythe is just the dex zwei
[2:54:00] <+Shishi1205> Btw state of Play in 40 mins aprox
[2:54:00] <Treasure_Vault> DS1 also had the best Black Knight Greataxe
[2:54:00] <alroy909> i love the zweihander
[2:54:02] <vampiresintwilightsparkle> great scythe is busted
[2:54:12] <Darren716> Reggi visit the skeles yet?
[2:54:14] <ilthyf> just got here, whats the death count?
[2:54:17] <+Vigonept> dragon school!
[2:54:22] <+Shishi1205> 3? or 2
[2:54:24] <+Grayhammatter> yes he did, he died
[2:54:25] <DSD24> Black Knight Sword was so cool looking
[2:54:25] <ArvidOnFire> Oh but I prefer the Claymore moveset so Kappa
[2:54:37] <Johannen> 2 on Asylum and 1 on skeletons i think
[2:54:50] <Darren716> Need dat dex
[2:54:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:54:51] <DSD24> Wow Woolie, I mean aren't even wrong but still
[2:54:53] <Pookiedaexzile> No Methheads will definitely bother you
[2:54:58] <Archmortal> personally though I'm Chaos Blade/Pyro for life in DS1.  Turns out the PvP meta is really fun in PvE too
[2:55:00] <total_overkill> how does a man that beat demons souls die so early?
[2:55:05] <DSD24> No Escape!
[2:55:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh god please don't use the estoc
[2:55:31] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:55:42] <AvroEltz> They do give souls
[2:55:45] <Archmortal> @total_overkill to be fair, DS1 is a solid step slower than Demon's.  It can take a little reorientation
[2:55:47] <velgaduere> no use the estoc MORE
[2:55:52] <@Solidus_113> backstep and running are usually the same
[2:55:53] <+Shishi1205> @total_overkill by snoozing and by skellys
[2:55:53] <ManfredA> the estoc is fine for early game

[2:58:50] <+zanz_san> I love Nioh but stfu about it now shizur6Kusa
[2:58:51] <ArvidOnFire> I always found that weird. Technically, anyone with the Darksign is cursed, right?
[2:58:54] <DSD24> @CanadianAnimatorGuy "He's a phantom...."
[2:58:55] <Sonny_Firestorm> @DatAsuna I said Reggie cause I thought Woolie was done with Nioh 1. I'd stick around for a Woolie LP all week long.

[3:16:25] <Shwepie> Name is literally just twohander.
[3:16:27] <SmortyPuffin> this game has real 'i can see russia from my backyard' energy
[3:16:32] <danknugglit> Giant dad build incoming
[3:16:35] <JetpackMcQuack> good way to lose a foot
[3:16:36] <laserbeaming> BECOME. GIANT.
[3:16:36] <+Razputin217> That’s a psaBig Boy sword for psaBig BOIZ
[3:16:41] <Gregorhasjoined> Gottburg of the Iron Hand had one too. BERSERK references yay!
[3:16:43] <+RemedyofRevenge> 16 str needed to two hand it
[3:16:44] <Klefth> GIANT.
[3:16:45] <Grev_stalmon> 18 if 2h
[3:16:49] <@Solidus_113> 16
[3:16:49] <pyjama_day> real talk... real zweihanders are not this heavy xD
[3:16:51] <Grev_stalmon> err 16
[3:16:55] <+andrew1ups> Haha become giant
[3:17:00] <+andrew1ups> That’s gold
[3:17:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> Become. Giant.
[3:17:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dual wield zweihanders like the man from heimdall
[3:17:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> If you have two thirds of that?
[3:17:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> how much do they weigh? @pyjama_day
[3:17:08] <AbnormalVoid> 2/3 to two hand
[3:17:09] <JetpackMcQuack> STAND BACK
[3:17:10] <GeoGio3> it gives an extra 50% str
[3:17:16] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:17:17] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:17:18] <+Sauerkrautron> The weak swing.
[3:17:19] <Ner234> WEAK
[3:17:20] <gryffinp> 2 hv
[3:17:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> weaksauce LUL
[3:17:24] <Onamar> It's faster if you have enough stats
[3:17:25] <danknugglit> Weak
[3:17:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> the bitch swing
[3:17:26] <KumaTorey> so what starting gift did reggie pick?
[3:17:27] <+Darky04> not stronk enoough
[3:17:32] <%Juriasu> isn't it half?
[3:17:38] <oneimportantthing> Not GIANT enough
[3:17:39] <+Sauerkrautron> 1.5x
[3:17:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @KumaTorey witch's ring
[3:17:40] <AbnormalVoid> it's so good
[3:17:44] <RealPT1> this boy needs some beef
[3:17:45] <+andrew1ups> Too smol
[3:17:49] <gryffinp> The way of the BIG SORD is a noble one
[3:17:51] <dlocke1991> too shit to wield it, son. better hit the gym
[3:17:51] <+eanscrale> damn they never brought these animations to the other games
[3:17:52] <Darren716> Gotta hit the gym
[3:17:53] <ilthyf> WHEAK
[3:17:54] <+Razputin217> Not psaBig enough
[3:17:55] <pyjama_day> @abelincoln_catpuncher online says 2KG
[3:17:55] <gryffinp> but it demands much from the user
[3:17:59] <oda_flobunaga> fageddabauddit
[3:18:01] <KumaTorey> @CappuccinoGuil Oh....this will be the Maximum souls experience then LUL
[3:18:03] <Clyderso> miss whiff
[3:18:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no 2 handing gives you +50% of your Str
[3:18:09] <pennykettle_> LUL
[3:18:10] <justcallmebobplease> It's a whiff stagger weapon
[3:18:10] <Treasure_Vault> Half plus 50%, so 24 is 16 + (1/2*16 = 8)
[3:18:11] <AvroEltz> just rewatched the giant dad video, onlyafro censored the "friend" in the video, so now its now family friendly
[3:18:16] <Estuko> @Darren716 I suddenly remember stick rpg on stickpage and going to the gym. lol
[3:18:17] <+megaman_sentinel> ultra Great sword pyromancer
[3:18:18] <JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis
[3:18:18] <+RaveBV> He's even wrong like Pat.
[3:18:19] <ManfredA> for axe weapons, whiffing causes recovery frames
[3:18:21] <+RaveBV> csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[3:18:22] <+RemedyofRevenge> 16
[3:18:23] <@Solidus_113> 16
[3:18:24] <laserbeaming> 16
[3:18:24] <pyjama_day> @abelincoln_catpuncher i can use one with 1 hand super easily, and i'm a scrawny little guy
[3:18:25] <$Invlux> 3\4?
[3:18:25] <Grev_stalmon> Reject Dexterity. Return to GIANT.
[3:18:25] <Hocotate> That guy's opinion of you couldn't get any lower anyway.  Don't worry about him.
[3:18:28] <+Jiggisnipe> kAPPA
[3:18:28] <%ozzrabbit> As long as Reggie pumps some STR, he should be able to use the Zweihänder pretty soon
[3:18:30] <+robertoszek> @WoolieVersus there's some coil whine when the loading screen is up, if you're playing on PC maybe cap the FPS to avoid it?
[3:18:36] <AbnormalVoid> it's half of your strength again, so your strength is 2/3 the requirement
[3:18:40] <emptyantics> Get b i g
[3:18:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> ⅔
[3:18:44] <Treasure_Vault> No apologies, the system is so dumb
[3:18:51] <Treasure_Vault> we're all stockholmed into understanding it
[3:18:52] <GeoGio3> 16 str plus half, 16+8 is 24
[3:18:56] <ForrestofFallenTrees> The morning star fumbles like that when you miss only
[3:18:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Morning Star is stronger, but just a bit
[3:19:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh nevermind
[3:19:04] <+Jiggisnipe> so 2/3 wasn't wrong
[3:19:06] <DapperCadavr> Morningstar does bleed as well
[3:19:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @pyjama_day and my trainer laughed at me creating to use a claymore lol
[3:19:10] <Dopamien> your other arm is only half as strong calebKek
[3:19:11] <%bread_assassin> So you need .75 then?
[3:19:14] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> for wanting*
[3:19:18] <@Solidus_113> you could also tell reggie about the whiff effect Axes have, where it takes longer to recover if you miss
[3:19:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @bread_assassin 66%
[3:19:32] <+Shishi1205> @bread_assassin thats 18
[3:19:35] <notablybaka> @bread_assassin no 2/3
[3:19:38] <SheefEatsBeef> drop your pause screen reggie
[3:19:39] <Clyderso> gamer
[3:19:42] <pennykettle_> virgin twitch chatters: do precise calculations to determine item requirements. chad first playthroughers: fat roll the entire game by equipping the strongest heaviest armor at all times

[3:27:27] <oda_flobunaga> He's dead Jim.
[3:27:28] <fantom_flasch> @xxMylord I think its probably designed that only 1 bloodstain can exist at a time, so when it breaks it prevents a new bloodstain spawn from overwriting the first
[3:27:28] <gryffinp> pyromancy has exactly 1(one) downside in this game: range.

[3:39:24] <Darren716> Pop a squat
[3:39:26] <%xxMylord> Reggie is very perceptive wow
[3:39:34] <+andrew1ups> Papa roach
[3:39:37] <gryffinp> is that still true in remake? I don't think its true in DS3
[3:39:38] <JdotSweapA> sit yo as down
[3:39:43] <gryffinp> er, remaster
[3:39:53] <+セビー> big props to reggie spotting these things
[3:39:58] <andre11dr> @gryffinp It is
[3:40:06] <%mikeiskill> I don't think remaster changed anything mechanically, so yeah, still gotta squat
[3:40:19] <andre11dr> It's wasn't until DS2 that just touching it saved it
[3:40:30] <JdotSweapA> gotta squat in all games right?
[3:40:35] <ManfredA> just 1
[3:40:52] <ManfredA> also remaster did change how Darkmoon works sadly
[3:40:55] <Crownaux0> never forget
[3:41:01] <%BisoromiBear> like that tragedy
[3:41:02] <CoupleAGuys> I forgot

[3:41:28] <laserbeaming> you want one offensive stat at 40
[3:41:40] <andre11dr> Woolie with the slim shaming over here Kappa
[3:41:53] <andre11dr> "being to flat ain't great"
[3:41:54] <DianaTheAscian> Reggie is a lot more tanky then I expected him to be
[3:42:00] <gryffinp> A new challenger has entered the fray!
[3:42:00] <Crownaux0> he was doing so good in that room
[3:42:03] <nailwind> Reggarth can take a beating

[3:42:33] <justcallmebobplease> Reggarth having a cage match is going to be lit.
[3:42:51] <Gregorhasjoined> Imagine if that was a mimic. Good god
[3:42:53] <+セビー> the invincibility during backstabs is just broken good
[3:42:55] <KeiganOfAstora> The health bar looks smaller in Demon's Souls and he rarely upgraded it so this is already more HP than he's used to
[3:43:07] <gryffinp> "This is a ceiling"
[3:43:10] <cthulu_fearlock> no fear opening that chest

[3:54:46] <pennykettle_> stockpile thomas is just an item now
[3:54:47] <marcdyllan> 420 souls blazin
[3:54:59] <+andrew1ups> Weed is illegal
[3:55:03] <+andrew1ups> I’m telling
[3:55:37] <iamtheTwitchghost> DESU
[3:55:38] <andre11dr> What are you talking about, Gwin is always blazing it
[3:55:41] <+セビー> wonder if we’ll see some arrow tech on the tail later
[3:55:49] <andre11dr> It's definitely legal here
[3:55:55] <SilverFaustX> sony direct sucked
[3:55:56] <derap41> Guess which is the best one
[3:56:02] <ManfredA> that heater shield is legit
[3:56:11] <rasamune> 'legal' implies that there are laws still
[3:56:18] <+andrew1ups> Use the dagger cuz parries
[3:56:32] <+andrew1ups> Kicks n parries only run
[3:56:46] <andre11dr> Daggers don't parry in this
[3:56:56] <andre11dr> Only the parry dagger
[3:56:59] <+andrew1ups> 😱
[3:57:28] <ManfredA> reinforced club is also legit
[3:57:28] <derap41> One of  the best weapons in the game no joke
[3:57:32] <brunoberserk> BONK
[3:57:32] <sirrice77> club is surprisingly good
[3:57:42] <ManfredA> reinforced club is goat tbh
[3:57:46] <AvroEltz> club as a in str scale
[3:57:47] <glass_marcus> Oh cool it's the SL1 weapon
[3:57:47] <Fxcknips> yooo
[3:57:51] <niddron> shit I forgot about state of play
[3:57:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> 💯
[3:58:02] <+Shishi1205> A scaling
[3:58:02] <derap41> and bleed
[3:58:07] <GeoGio3> love the club scaling
[3:58:13] <+Samutz> @niddron You didn't miss anything
[3:58:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:58:14] <+Chimeraelite> Don't worry about it state of play was meh
[3:58:16] <GeoGio3> bonk them inded
[3:58:16] <nailwind> Kreygasm endgame worthy
[3:58:18] <%Double_Tap_That> Toothpick time
[3:58:27] <Estuko> @niddron Literally nothing was missed.
[3:58:29] <AvroEltz> no dont look at that woolie might go crazy
[3:58:46] <laserbeaming> Rainfoece
[3:58:54] <andre11dr> @double_tap_that Nah the toothpick is the Bladder side sword
[3:59:06] <andre11dr> Fuckin hate the weapon
[3:59:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hating on the baller swag sword smh
[3:59:29] <niddron> @estuko cool but apparently Let it die is getting something? that's cool
[3:59:33] <laserbeaming> Reinforced Club is really good for non scaling weapon paths
[3:59:51] <laserbeaming> Chaos/Lightning, specifically
[3:59:53] <+セビー> swag sword has its builds
[4:00:05] <teh_Question> BEAST SHIELD
[4:00:05] <nailwind> godlike
[4:00:07] <andre11dr> @abelincoln_catpuncher I know it OP as hell, but i looks like shit
[4:00:08] <Darren716> It's good but the knight's is right ahead
[4:00:09] <jumpyhugs> heater shield is my boiiii
[4:00:19] <andre11dr> It truly looks like a toothpick
[4:00:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @andre11dr an elegant weapon, from a more civilized age
[4:00:30] <Iniudan> heater shield is one of the best shield in the game, medium shield stat, with small shield parry
[4:00:36] <ManfredA> heater shield is pretty much the best shield until you get more specialized ones
[4:00:37] <jumpyhugs> ^^
[4:00:46] <+andrew1ups> Should probably carry the heater in ur pocket regardless
[4:00:47] <gryffinp> as a general, though not ironclad rule, wood shields have better magic resist but worse phys resis than metal shields
[4:00:51] <pennykettle_> hollows be shoppin
[4:01:01] <laserbeaming> Heater Shield is better than Knight's Shield though
[4:01:08] <andre11dr> @abelincoln_catpuncher I'll use the Silver Knight Sword, no thanks
[4:01:15] <glass_marcus> This guy is THE merchant for early game
[4:01:20] <ManfredA> Knight's shield is actually worse than the hollow warrior shield too
[4:01:25] <ManfredA> like outright worse
[4:01:27] <+Bitscreed> I'm surprised this merchant isn't dead yet.
[4:01:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> silver Knight shield is amazing also
[4:01:34] <pennykettle_> I rocked this chain set for a while
[4:01:40] <@Solidus_113> how many arrows did it take to cheese the Drake Sword? 150?
[4:01:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @andre11dr yeah silver sword looks way cooler
[4:01:45] <pennykettle_> This armor is nice and loud
[4:01:46] <AvroEltz> is ugly but good
[4:01:51] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 sth like that

[5:02:36] <%Darmanimon> if you're a zoner you don't go in
[5:02:38] <velgaduere> no fun, only Dark Souls
[5:02:39] <JdotSweapA> late roll. its all good we goochi
[5:02:40] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock
[5:02:41] <maplefried> Overhead slams are tricky to time no matter which entry you're playing
[5:02:43] <linSP> Ooooof
[5:02:44] <+mechslayer71> that really wasn't bad tho
[5:02:48] <%Mrthefro> LUL
[5:02:49] <Johannen> Cant block overheads thou
[5:02:51] <slix3431> We are watching Reggie slowly Hollow
[5:02:55] <%Darmanimon> only go in once all your other options are exhausted
[5:02:56] <+The_Switchback> I always back off those overheads they are nasty
[5:02:59] <andre11dr> As tough as this is, it's still nothing compared to Crapa
[5:02:59] <+gryffon95> gotta get use to the bosses rhythm, especially with rolling
[5:03:00] <pennykettle_> Blocking is way way way better than it looks. The moon could crash into the earth and you could still block it with your shield
[5:03:00] <nailwind> Reggie made Taurus Demon hype
[5:03:00] <kazadaz> Perfect play, then one mistake
[5:03:00] <Crownaux0> you'll get it Reggie, keep trying
[5:03:04] <Crowroost> Does the DeS remake feel that much different that Reggarth I's skills dont transfer over?

[5:03:26] <%mikeiskill> @mechslayer71 shoutouts to DS2's giant hammer dudes in dragon aerie
[5:03:36] <%xxMylord> @Crowroost i'ts mostly about learning boss patterns
[5:03:39] <maplefried> Oh shoot, Capra is going to destroy Reggie's psyche
[5:03:40] <agianttornado> @Crowroost He forgot like PeachSaliva does
[5:03:41] <emptyantics> @mikeiskill Fuck thos dudes LUL
[5:03:41] <+cdrom321> @crowroost That's what I was wondering.
[5:03:46] <dundore77> you can "run" up ladders can't you?
[5:03:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is it I can feel it
[5:03:50] <+Jiggisnipe> @セビー I bet he kills it 1st try LUL
[5:03:51] <jupiterjumper> Reggie go and spank that oversized cow.
[5:03:56] <+robertoszek> @Crowroost I was wondering the same thing, did he just power through and didn't learn to... backstab?
[5:03:57] <BurdRightsActivist> @maplefried Mind_Break, Bimbofication
[5:03:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> this run has the sauce
[5:04:01] <DianaTheAscian> @maplefried it will break him

[5:04:03] <JdotSweapA> look at dat pace!
[5:04:06] <fuji_n2> Oh he is already at Taurus?
[5:04:13] <+セビー> @dundore77 can slide down, not fast climb
[5:04:19] <andre11dr> While this is pretty though, Crapa Demon is fine true hard wall the game throws at you
[5:04:20] <jupiterjumper> If only he knew about that paper.
[5:04:20] <fuji_n2> no snailsouls here huh

[5:05:59] <maplefried> Shields are so good in DS1, Miyazaki removed them in his proceeding project
[5:05:59] <%Darmanimon> has he not gotten a better weapon than the axe yet?
[5:06:02] <jupiterjumper> Reggie go, you can do it!

[5:16:56] <+cdrom321> @maplefried Is it still NG+ only though. I thought the remaster extended it to NG.
[5:17:01] <Awesome_Leaf> <3

[5:18:04] <Jontman42> victory was achieved
[5:18:04] <OblivionSword1> beat Taurus on the first session that's a great start
[5:18:05] <Visorak6> rough start but very entertaining
[5:18:05] <TheAzureOracle> He's learning
[5:18:05] <nabs96> Great session
[5:18:06] <CoupleAGuys> Was p good
[5:18:06] <%Artoo__The_Me> Reggie will remember the ladder for tomorrow
[5:18:07] <oneimportantthing> Great job Reg!
[5:18:07] <slix3431> Yeah was good sesh
[5:18:08] <kazadaz> FIVE HOURS, that's a lotta souls
[5:18:10] <jupiterjumper> Reggie was so close to going hollow lmao LUL
[5:18:10] <Lancaster_H> i see your tactic of hollowing out reggie before dokapon woolie @WoolieVersus
[5:18:10] <Pookiedaexzile> We have witnessed a Great Becoming
[5:18:11] <karawra> really good and fun thanks
[5:18:13] <$Invlux> Put it in my VEEEEINSSSSSS
[5:18:13] <bobxmaker> hey i didn't kill taurus on my first day
[5:18:13] <brunoberserk> it was indeed good
[5:18:15] <Arqartur0> Yes
[5:18:17] <JdotSweapA> very good first sesh. prop
[5:18:18] <maplefried> Reggie will learn as he did with DeS
[5:18:18] <%livlinn> Amazing shiaVibin
[5:18:19] <pennykettle_> My first playthrough was like 250 hours so
[5:18:20] <%Vigonept> reggie going hollow
[5:18:21] <shotgunmcdooter> had a lot of fun watching wew
[5:18:22] <velgaduere> welcome to Dark Souls, Reggie
[5:18:23] <%mikeiskill> Reggie did great, the discourse around this game makes a blind playthrough of it way harder
[5:18:24] <Djinnazz> He's making good mental progress.
[5:18:25] <KellBeII> youre doin a pretty good job as the hip guider woolie
[5:18:25] <+kewlmyc> LUL
[5:18:27] <+andrew1ups> Ur gonna go bald from this lol 😂
[5:18:27] <+セビー> Reggie vs Dark Souls pt.1 (final)
[5:18:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggie just has to stop doubting himself, he's good at souls games
[5:18:30] <+matshat> I love these games, and even i get negative on them sometimes
[5:18:30] <andre11dr> So today we learned that Reggie is more blind than an actual blind broken mustard lady
[5:18:31] <JetpackMcQuack> that's why we're here
[5:18:32] <justcallmebobplease> This game WILL tilt
[5:18:32] <slix3431> Wen Senn's Fortress?
[5:18:34] <+Drotanyth> Good Sesh, if he didn't have anxiety before, he will now.
[5:18:36] <Deko_> we all been there
[5:18:39] <chancho4tierra> how many souls he lost in real life?
[5:18:42] <SmortyPuffin> drop your shield
[5:18:43] <@Menitta> DS1 is generally harder than DeS right?
[5:18:43] <maplefried> Dude, Reggie, getting tilted in Souls is perfectly normal
[5:18:45] <SmortyPuffin> perfect
[5:18:45] <glass_marcus> Reggie, Tilt is a mechanic
[5:18:49] <nabs96> Also shout out to you Woolz for actually adapting your teaching style where it's needed. I really appreciate that @woolieversus
[5:18:50] <dundore77> it happens.
[5:18:50] <AbnormalVoid> Dark Souls is, more than anything, a puzzle game
[5:18:51] <Johannen> Now Woolie knows how Pat felt all those times
[5:18:53] <%RyTYoung> Reggie you were just in the same position as everyone else in this game
[5:18:55] <+The_Switchback> Tilt is a stat in this game
[5:18:55] <nailwind> do NOT apologize Reggie <3 this is optimal
[5:18:56] <%baka_sugoi> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[5:18:56] <pennykettle_> People legitimately ragequit the game over and over and come back in the first few levels of this game before it finally clicks
[5:18:57] <OblivionSword1> Woolie now you know
[5:18:58] <AvroEltz> wasnt a good sesh, you didnt tell reggie to get gud enough times
[5:18:58] <@Solidus_113> Fortress isn't for a while
[5:18:58] <emptyantics> Can’t wait will the [BIG SHOT] boss fight KomodoHype
[5:19:00] <+andrew1ups> Lmaooo he apologized 😂😂😂
[5:19:02] <Crowroost> Woolie this is scarily similar to the hidden bonfire in Darkroot
[5:19:03] <%hiswill98> You did a great job Reggie, don’t feel down. Taurus Demon is a WALL for a lot of players.
[5:19:04] <AbnormalVoid> you gotta play the puzzle game
[5:19:11] <+BigBruthaThunda> one pair covers up, and the other pair of balls become exposed. this is the way
[5:19:25] <+twenty112> Any session that doesn't end with getting walled by a boss is a good one
[5:19:26] <SainEdge> was similar for me, i had a friend guide me trough the first few hours and i was really blind and dense LUL
[5:19:27] <+cdrom321> You can tell him anything. The chat won't like it, but who cares about them.
[5:19:27] <Asuterisuku> Pyromancy was doing great damage to a boss that's weak to LIGHTNING.
[5:19:28] <emptyantics> @bigbruthathunda LUL
[5:19:28] <andre11dr> Cant wait for some goats, that'll be fun DarkMode
[5:19:29] <glass_marcus> The only Resistance stat you need to level in this game is Tilt Resistance
[5:19:29] <pennykettle_> <3
[5:19:31] <Melchior_the_Wise> @BigBruthaThunda you have 2 pairs of balls?
[5:19:31] <alroy909> oh yeah, woolie, pat, and the fucking hidden bonefire of darkroot forest
[5:19:36] <+matshat> Woolie is doing great, the way Pat over guides is awful
[5:19:40] <JdotSweapA> GG Reg!
[5:19:41] <justcallmebobplease> WE DARK SOULSIN'
[5:19:41] <Crowroost> ! Reggie at risk !
[5:19:44] <+BigBruthaThunda> u dont? @Melchior_the_Wise
[5:19:46] <nailwind> its been a while since I've seen Reggie shook
[5:19:47] <kazadaz> Is Reggie aware of M****s?
[5:19:49] <jupiterjumper> @Asuterisuku almost like pyromancy is easy mode in DS1
[5:19:51] <maplefried> @alroy909 that was fucking rough
[5:19:53] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie only will tell him about clues for cool stuff but he won't tell him about progress
[5:19:55] <$SilverRoddo> Guide his hips
[5:19:59] <+SWFanatic> I'm good enough, I'm strong enough
[5:19:59] <$Invlux> You made some sick progress though
[5:20:00] <+セビー> Pat hand holds paige to the extent she never internlaizes anything
[5:20:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> It wasn't even that rough tbh
[5:20:01] <%RyTYoung> You would've figured it out either way doods woolieSMUG woolieKICKDAD
[5:20:04] <+Jiggisnipe> 1 boss
[5:20:05] <%Jrockoni> Jrockoni subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Reggie you beat the first big wall of this game. take a drink to that success. Cheers my dude.
[5:20:06] <+SWFanatic> And gosh darnit, People like me
[5:20:06] <agianttornado> remember Shrine of Storms??
[5:20:08] <JdotSweapA> Mission Complete!
[5:20:15] <emptyantics> Can’t wait for the A*****s boss fight Kreygasm
[5:20:20] <kinkade_77> i hate demon fights in these games
[5:20:20] <%hiswill98> Yeah remember shrine of storms?
[5:20:20] <pennykettle_> csbeastB csbeastE csbeastA csbeastS csbeastT
[5:20:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> People get completely stuck on first bosses in these games
[5:20:23] <+Grayhammatter> 1 boss completed, we do it
[5:20:25] <ohno778> Woolie is now the master
[5:20:29] <jupiterjumper> Yooo can't wait for dat boy, Capra

[5:20:50] <kazadaz> I would be... very impressed if Reg beats O&S in the first sesh
[5:20:51] <andre11dr> As i said, if Reggie can beat 4-1 he can beat this
[5:20:52] <velgaduere> welcome to Dark Souls, Reggie lobosHype

[5:20:59] <Solidnick18> and not dokapon? LUL
[5:21:02] <@Menitta> Off the bat is this harder or easier than demon souls do you think Reggie
[5:21:07] <$Invlux> Oh Dragon God LUL
[5:21:07] <pennykettle_> Dragon God

[5:21:17] <user_naim> We all get clowned on in Souls games
[5:21:20] <$SilverRoddo> Dokapon Souls
[5:21:38] <nailwind> didnt Reggie breeze through DeS off the bat, its eben a while
[5:21:48] <pennykettle_> Portal lets plays are the most painful because the puzzle solutions are obvious
[5:21:56] <maplefried> What is easy for some can be insurmountable for others
[5:21:56] <Crowroost> can't wait for the new version of Dragon God design in Elden Ring lmao
[5:21:57] <agianttornado> @nailwind lol nah
[5:22:02] <jorniev> hindsight is too easy to fool us
[5:22:03] <@Menitta> I cant think of a single twitch chat like that
[5:22:04] <+xerotwo> It's the same thing as PUPPET LUL
[5:22:04] <@Solidus_113> That same mentality goes into FF14 raids LUL
[5:22:07] <andre11dr> Dokapon mode was engaged for a moment today
[5:22:09] <@Solidus_113> just dodge the mechanics
[5:22:10] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie for real thought the archers were just apart of the boss. Like you just have to deal with them
[5:22:10] <gryffinp> I mean they're not the only reason
[5:22:11] <AvroEltz> Oh yeah, every subsequent playtrough, taurus will become even more of a pushover
[5:22:11] <Solidnick18> yup
[5:22:12] <+セビー> i wouldnt know how to tell someone those hints
[5:22:12] <GeoGio3> It's the dark souls way
[5:22:16] <tenshi_q> LUL
[5:22:17] <Crowroost> But Woolie is blind...
[5:22:17] <emptyantics> Reggie is gonna have a salt poisoning from Dokapon and DarkSouls lol
[5:22:18] <bobxmaker> that's why watching beginners play because we feed of that frustration that we've all experienced
[5:22:21] <AbnormalVoid> LUL
[5:22:22] <Nitsuj293> coneySHAKE
[5:22:22] <jupiterjumper> It's not just because of Dark Souls but true
[5:22:25] <Zantetzuken> branded a blind man
[5:22:26] <+kewlmyc> Snailsborne really did a number on Woolie.
[5:22:27] <pennykettle_> We have to show Woolie's blindness in his DS1 LP to Reggie, when those clips arent spoilers
[5:22:31] <+xerotwo> Tomorrow.... BLOOD will be SHED doodScrub
[5:22:32] <%mr_sups> That's a reason why people are so aggro on Souls LPs
[5:22:34] <justcallmebobplease> Don't worry Woolie, you'd get called blind even without that!
[5:22:35] <gryffinp> I think the big issue is that woolie just went and gave reggie wrong advice
[5:22:40] <$Invlux> That tilt is CONTENT LUL
[5:22:41] <andre11dr> @woolieversus Snailborne
[5:22:42] <JdotSweapA> we were all blind once

[5:23:49] <nabs96> @dakuu75 He should do it how he wants instead of caring about chat. there's a reason we all wanted chat to be removed from the equation. fk chat.

[5:29:15] <+paladinstarbuster> They are basically the same guy
[5:29:16] <+matshat> Level 4 Dsylexia
[5:29:17] <glass_marcus> He's referencing that they were the same game at one point
[5:29:17] <ohno778> Leon was supposed to be Dante
[5:29:24] <Solidnick18> nioh FeelsGoodMan
[5:29:26] <+cdrom321> No. DS1!
[5:29:26] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie straight into Nioh 2 LUL
[5:29:27] <andre11dr> You playing RE4
[5:29:28] <+DatAsuna> Don't skip nioh 1
[5:29:32] <NRhyme> this stream was real fuckin' neato.
[5:29:33] <%vVAstrAVv> no no i love both lol
[5:29:34] <QueequegTheater> Nioh 2 is a fucking nightmare
[5:29:35] <gryffinp> I honestly didn't like Nioh very much
[5:29:37] <+Shishi1205> Nioh is super bs
[5:29:38] <@Solidus_113> CBT
[5:29:38] <vnzuelandude> hell yeah
[5:29:38] <%mikeiskill> Nioh 2 is the best
[5:29:39] <+mikesapartment> infinity souls
[5:29:40] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[5:29:41] <nailwind> wanna get unfair?
[5:29:41] <andre11dr> You did play RE 4
[5:29:42] <+Grayhammatter> CBT
[5:29:43] <velgaduere> LUL
[5:29:46] <%mikeiskill> like a Souls character action game
[5:29:46] <justcallmebobplease> Woolie has accurately described Nioh
[5:29:47] <Solidnick18> It's ninja gaiden FeelsGoodMan
[5:29:49] <CrimsonGargoyle> FACTS LUL
[5:29:50] <%Irridium> do you need your balls crushed?
[5:29:50] <@Menitta> I disagree. Nioh 2 was the first one I actually got into
[5:29:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> Nioh will fuck you right up and you'll ask for more
[5:29:52] <Estuko> Nioh would be really brutal, DS1 will be really fun and I can't wait for the journey
[5:29:52] <%knivesatmidnight> pointerthanthou subscribed with Prime. 
[5:29:53] <+matshat> Nioh is too fast
[5:29:54] <%vVAstrAVv> nioh 2 is easier than 1
[5:29:57] <+DatAsuna> Nioh 2 is fine but it screws up some of the good things about 1
[5:29:59] <NeroInfinite> NIOH will definatly fuck your shit up.
[5:30:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1452876605185998851?t=s4kcX_jYto2dS6pItMmhRg&s=19
[5:30:03] <supergoblinpunch> Good shit though
[5:30:04] <QueequegTheater> This game started a fucking arms race.
[5:30:04] <emptyantics> Nioh is so fucking good minus the loot
[5:30:09] <%Josef_Stryker> Nioh is a Souls + Character Action game
[5:30:09] <Crowroost> Everyone Loves Patches
[5:30:10] <laserbeaming> Nioh's got Stances though
[5:30:10] <maplefried> Thought for sure you mentioned having played RE4, Woolz
[5:30:12] <+Jiggisnipe> do you enjoy Souls and Ninja Gaiden, clearly you hate yourself so enjoy Nioh
[5:30:12] <gryffinp> honestly I disagree, I feel like the Undead Burg is actually the most raw shit in the series
[5:30:12] <+polothegreatest> woke up to BDSM LUL
[5:30:14] <KR_Black> Do you want to get butt wrecked by a huge monkey ?Then try Nioh 2
[5:30:15] <OldManDeckardCain> nioh kinda requires a different skillset than souls games tbf
[5:30:18] <@Menitta> Nioh 2 is incredible
[5:30:22] <+mechslayer71> wait till Reggie gets to Sekiro OMEGALUL
[5:30:22] <gryffinp> the entire rest of the series pales in comparison to the Burg
[5:30:22] <vnzuelandude> Nioh = Dark Souls + Ninja Gaiden
[5:30:24] <KyberNasse> Nioh feels more arcadey
[5:30:24] <Djinnazz> the first YOKAI would take you multiple tries
[5:30:28] <%Dakuu75> "PHD in thuggery" lmao
[5:30:28] <Qu1ckyyy> SOULS
[5:30:30] <andre11dr> Once you unlock moves ,Nioh ain't THAT bad
[5:30:34] <Estuko> *I turn away from the mic to breath
[5:30:48] <+Jiggisnipe> on the nose
[5:30:49] <fangovafang> Sinner is pretty solid too for a souls like
[5:30:49] <emptyantics> @estuko LUL
[5:30:50] <+Jiggisnipe> I ahte it
[5:30:52] <+matshat> DS2 intro is so poorly written
[5:30:53] <+Jiggisnipe> hate*
[5:30:54] <ohno778> DS2 kinda wack
[5:30:55] <JdotSweapA> so dumb
[5:30:57] <gryffinp> nowhere near as bad as ds3 did it though
[5:31:00] <nailwind> fucking hated that intro
[5:31:04] <+Grayhammatter> DS2 is kinda wack
[5:31:06] <emptyantics> DS2 intro is cringe
[5:31:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ladle run!
[5:31:12] <%tank7013> "This game is so hard you guys you don't even know"
[5:31:13] <ShogunRaven> DS2 is cringe
[5:31:16] <JdotSweapA> Bamco milking the "difficulty" meme
[5:31:17] <andre11dr> DS2 is a little corny
[5:31:20] <%Ensign_Epic> ugh DS2 is... there are many reasons to bounce from DS2 & it gives you the first almost ASAP in that intro
[5:31:22] <+DatAsuna> the DNA of the soul
[5:31:24] <KyberNasse> Toxic grandmas
[5:31:25] <%BinaryFireball> the game definitely should laugh at you
[5:31:25] <+matshat> You can feel the lack of Miyazaki in DS2
[5:31:26] <gryffinp> Sekiro
[5:31:26] <%Dakuu75> DAMN STRAIGHT
[5:31:27] <+Jiggisnipe> the marketing and the game shouldn't lean into OMG it's so hard
[5:31:28] <@Solidus_113> true
[5:31:28] <velgaduere> right opinion
[5:31:29] <%Lion_kun> As you play more, the games will click more and you get better
[5:31:30] <+セビー> theres some stuff i love about DS2, but that intro.. ugh
[5:31:32] <$Invlux> "nyehhehheh, git gud, chosen undead!"
[5:31:32] <nailwind> Bloodborne GOAT
[5:31:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> DS3 came after BB
[5:31:35] <Afrosamasenpai> Right one.
[5:31:37] <waltzqueen> Bloodborne best game
[5:31:37] <maplefried> GOOD ANSWER WOOLIE
[5:31:37] <%Lion_kun> And then Sekiro
[5:31:39] <JdotSweapA> ds3
[5:31:42] <%Josef_Stryker> Bloodborne has the best PVE easily
[5:31:44] <Afrosamasenpai> WHEN'S PC PORT
[5:31:44] <%Lion_kun> You forgot Sekiro
[5:31:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bloodborne > Cinders Mod >> Everything Else
[5:31:44] <OblivionSword1> before DS 3 I think
[5:31:45] <GeoGio3> DS1 best
[5:31:45] <%Prevot> narration old lady: "you're gonna die like a bitch"
[5:31:45] <%Cozy90> ds3 still my fav
[5:31:47] <andre11dr> TRUE

[5:31:58] <Solidnick18> bloodborne is soooooooo fucking cool
[5:31:59] <+DatAsuna> I can't really replay bloodborne just cause I hate to beat 95% of the game to get my favourite weapon
[5:32:01] <%RyTYoung> Reggie woolieVS Sekiro NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:32:01] <%Vigonept> It is fantasy tho

[5:32:13] <Asuterisuku> Bloodborne was before DS3, wasn't it?
[5:32:13] <+matshat> Bloodborne is amazing, it just lacks the customization/builds
[5:32:14] <DeathByPoke7> A S T H E T I C
[5:32:15] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is the best one  even tho it looks like shit in some places

[5:33:03] <+twohitgood> there's ONE use for that shield.
[5:33:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> There are two shields in BB, actually
[5:33:06] <+spardanwarrior> You parry enemies by SHOOTING THEM IN THE FACE
[5:33:09] <Crowroost> Well, DS1 LP over now, Reggie gonna Bloodborne now

[5:33:19] <+eanscrale> Shields are alright, but not if they engender passivity
[5:33:19] <maplefried> Woolie*
[5:33:21] <+Shishi1205> there's the magic shield in the dlc
[5:33:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Parry like a real hunter

[5:33:38] <@Menitta> Bloodborne is just
[5:33:40] <gryffinp> I love that ds2 and bloodborne tricked souls fans into going "oh blocking is a baby move for babies" and then sekiro went "LEARN TO BLOCK MOTHERFUCKER"
[5:33:41] <IzanagiNoOokami> Bloodborne ready go?
[5:33:41] <Nitsuj293> Going to be the remake by then LUL
[5:33:44] <@Menitta> theres nothing like it

[5:33:49] <scrubintodreams> @DatAsuna I know my weapon is the Church Pick. Not as bad, but I still gotta beat Ludwig first. LUL
[5:33:51] <maplefried> @nailwind same, absolutely zero regrets
[5:33:52] <@Menitta> even the souls games
[5:33:54] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is my favorite Castlevania game
[5:33:59] <+twohitgood> HBBK best drop. here's hoping for good rolls.
[5:34:00] <%BinaryFireball> reggie vs paige bo5
[5:34:01] <@Menitta> bloodborne hits so different
[5:34:01] <ShogunRaven> did Reggie meet the first Black Knight?
[5:34:05] <Qsmash_> I guess the Victorian stuff just doesn't do it for me then
[5:34:06] <kell_5s> sekiro tho
[5:34:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> My take is not that shields are bad, it's that FromSoft doesn't know how to make shields work into combos.

[5:36:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's not "downhill from here", unless you mean the second half of this game. I'd say the other games are all at LEAST as good as the later areas of ds1, if not better
[5:36:34] <KR_Black> ENB Still plays @kewlmyc
[5:36:36] <%DashXero> @kewlmyc He still streams.

[5:41:56] <%mikeiskill> so next sesh is just Bloodborne, yeah? I'm here for it
[5:41:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> God, I hate that phrase about the shield in Bloodborne.
[5:41:56] <nabs96> I hope Woolz doesn't skip over DS2 to get to BB faster tho

[5:42:31] <andre11dr> I NEED 60 FPS
[5:42:33] <+milhousego> @mechslayer71 oooh, and woolie's his coach? is he telling him to drop his shield all the time??
[5:42:45] <+Grayhammatter> one on the board
[5:42:50] <Klefth> Sony porting Horizon and GoW but not Bloodborne has got to be intentional
[5:42:55] <Solidnick18> 1 down many to go
[5:42:59] <ShogunRaven> When we getting the DS LP on the channel?
[5:42:59] <+milhousego> @mechslayer71 is woolie reminding him to drop his shield a lot?
[5:43:08] <@Menitta> bloodborne is gonna happen eventually
[5:43:15] <@Menitta> its money on the table
[5:43:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @Klefth well both of those games have sequels so it is intentional
[5:43:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Someone needs to create Darkapon! Whoever is losing can become a DarkWraith!
[5:43:19] <@Menitta> give it time
[5:43:23] <nailwind> this sesh was great, i met my smiling quota for a full month

[5:43:27] <%TheBesteban> Damn, do I need to check out Combo Babies?
[5:43:27] <%Irridium> the fact people keep forgetting Days Gone got ported never fails to make me chuckle. Always just talk about Horizon and God of War LUL
[5:43:30] <%Prevot> bloodborne will get a remaster or PC release right after woolie and reggie finish the original version, 5 years from now
[5:43:31] <+DatAsuna> "Not Invented Here"
[5:43:36] <@Menitta> IM SO MAD I MISSED THAT
[5:43:44] <Monkeyweed21> @ShogunRaven prolly after Raidou and Metroid Dread finish, so that its DS1 and Dokapon
