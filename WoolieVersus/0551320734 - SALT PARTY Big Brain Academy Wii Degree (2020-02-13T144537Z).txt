[0:33:46] <Jrocy247> LUL
[0:33:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> This isn't competing against others as much as it is against yourself
[0:33:52] <@Solidus_113> that was bad
[0:33:56] <dapperskeleton69> big brain provides 0 thuggery
[0:33:59] <Rishnix> I'd love to see a rematch.
[0:34:01] <%Solidnick18> we didn't have big brains
[0:34:04] <%CJett92> that was fine, ok, kinda ehhh

[0:37:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Big Brain was fine. but then I liked the Tokyo Mirage Session #FE playthrough so maybe I'm weird.
[0:37:15] <@Solidus_113> They did that on the first stream with LittleV
[0:37:17] <Atticus_Rex> "It's 4 in the morning and we're just wrapping up monopoly..."
[0:37:23] <hntronium> Didn't they play mario party already?

[0:38:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> Better safe than sorry
[0:38:32] <powerprotoman> so woolz if you want the SALTIEST of parties i recomend dokapon kingdom, warning there is a story mode and you can pull some scumbag shit because its a hostile mario party with rpg battles instead of minigames
[0:38:35] <arkv01> whats going on with the podcast mic setups?
[0:38:42] <%Solidnick18> don't turn off again FeelsBadMan
[0:38:47] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> hey alright

[0:38:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Could just be the res down and not the res up
[0:38:57] <dapperskeleton69> tank!
[0:39:02] <zenith0111> TANK
[0:39:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> Time is the only thing at stake here, it depends on how much you value that
[0:39:07] <dapperskeleton69> tank?
[0:39:15] <SheefEatsBeef> dokapon is amazing

[0:39:33] <gustavozxd> dokapon is the most evil, Mario party is NOTHING next to it
[0:39:36] <+MrAtheGreat> Guns made be pulled, murders may be committed
[0:39:43] <+Lord_Scrublet> 4 players for maximal suffering
[0:39:44] <%SomersaultJustice> that game is great, but it takes like a billion years to play one game
[0:39:47] <SheefEatsBeef> it's hand off the controller style
[0:39:47] <powerprotoman> its on wii as well
[0:39:48] <%Prevot> isn't it on Wii too?
[0:39:49] <ll_aja_ll> did you hear aboutthe W101 kickstarter?

[0:39:55] <%SomersaultJustice> there's a wii version for 4 players
[0:39:59] <%Solidnick18> it's super long but very evil
