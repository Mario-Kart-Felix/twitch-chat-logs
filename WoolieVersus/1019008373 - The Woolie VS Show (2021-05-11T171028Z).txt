[0:26:55] <%Seancicle> üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª
[0:27:00] <iacus_> @X2Eliah yeah but at least the others are portrayed with some internal consistency
[0:27:13] <%krispen_wa> the game criticizes centrists who don't commit. the game HATES people who commit to centrism
[0:27:14] <Indigo_Automaton> Physical Instrument go UP
[0:27:15] <%Juriasu> no longer a ham sandwich
[0:27:24] <andre11dr> Ok i didn't miss anything, as expected
[0:27:25] <%Seancicle> au contraire mon fr√®re
[0:27:44] <Equirah> people really trying to defend centrism over here.....
[0:28:18] <iacus_> Because most people don't know what centrism is
[0:28:26] <Jaysky> My body rejects protein hard
[0:28:32] <%X2Eliah> Body inertia is real
[0:28:51] <Jaysky> If I take too much protein it gives me intense stomach aches for the rest of the day and it fuckin sucks
[0:28:53] <gunsrlove> Keto is not a weightloss diet, a calorie deficit is. Keto was created for people with conditions that might be affected by large amounts of carbs, such as seizures, glucose oxidation, the "brain fog" , etc.
[0:28:59] <+Damie904> Woolie ur not alone, I got a similar body. Gotta go hardcore or nothing.
[0:29:10] <%X2Eliah> @Jaysky Any protein? If it's Whey, could be lactose related
[0:29:13] <andre11dr> Most people think centrism is just " everyone just do you" which is not what it is
[0:29:15] <sushahana> hardcore!
[0:29:21] <%nicversus> if your balls ain't hard go home
[0:29:33] <+OblivionSword1> HARDCORE
[0:29:40] <Lancaster_H> TO THE MAX!
[0:29:43] <Equirah> cheat days tho
[0:29:46] <%X2Eliah> YEKOKATAA
[0:29:48] <%krispen_wa> INTERNALLY COHERENT
[0:29:58] <+Mendin> But is it really?
[0:29:59] <%Seancicle> toute gloire est d√©riv√©e de YHWH
[0:29:59] <Jaysky> @Jaysky I've tried various kinds, made sure it wasn't whey later on and it'll still do it. I can get away with a protein bar but if I make a shake? I'm dead.
[0:30:10] <+metzselaar> But what is the question?
[0:30:11] <BRBN310> im trying to gain weight but its extremely hard :(
[0:30:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god i cant wait for then, like a month from now LUL
[0:30:27] <+Mendin> It's only a riddle if you don't know the answer.
[0:30:49] <X2Eliah> Top 5 is too many
[0:30:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:30:50] <+Vigonept> low authority!
[0:30:51] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:30:51] <Jaysky> 3's better
[0:30:56] <$dudedude55555> authority: 1
[0:30:58] <%the_Punktuation> fair
[0:30:59] <andre11dr> if i say Inland Empire does that mean that im crazy?
[0:30:59] <+OblivionSword1> low perception for sure
[0:31:01] <%krispen_wa> I keep trying to cut carbs from my diet, but rice is literally what i was raised on
[0:31:03] <Ids560> the QA version of esprit de corps
[0:31:04] <+walternatorz> 4. One from each main stat.
[0:31:08] <+Mrbaconator> perception 1
[0:31:09] <iacus_> half-light
[0:31:13] <+Abii_Artesian> hey @woolieversus  I work with Artesian and wanted to stop in and say Hey
[0:31:14] <Blank9> reggie is volition
[0:31:16] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr nah, just imaginative
[0:31:20] <Lancaster_H> perception 0
[0:31:23] <+Mrbaconator> reggie is volition
[0:31:25] <%Seancicle> üññüèªü§üüèª
[0:31:30] <Chatterbox1991> Half Light, Visual Calculus, Logic, Shivers, Inland Empire.
[0:31:33] <BigManLugan> hand-eye coordination for sick combos
[0:31:38] <AvroEltz> Character woolie has 10 drama
[0:31:40] <+Prevot> how high is your cop stat? LUL
[0:31:41] <+Mendin> Volta Do Mar
[0:31:43] <primaryfire> esprit de corps for the narcs
[0:31:53] <+SammyOVision> Hand eye/interfacing for sure
[0:31:56] <%wolfofsound> hand eye coordination
[0:31:58] <%X2Eliah> Conceptualization must be woolie's dump stat
[0:32:01] <+BappoTheMighty> lol
[0:32:13] <+OblivionSword1> hand eye and interfacing probably
[0:32:14] <%krispen_wa> Isn't Pat's Conceptualization literally 0?
[0:32:19] <%gatorafan> I imagine in Disco's rules having a primary stat doesn't make you crazy, but leveling it up to a certain point does daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:32:21] <haitakaa> conceptualize left from right
[0:32:21] <Blank9> rhetoric for woolie
[0:32:22] <andre11dr> Woolie has high drama and savoir faire I'd say
[0:32:23] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa ? no
[0:32:32] <%X2Eliah> @Blank9 omg yes
[0:32:45] <Lancaster_H> yeah woolies signature is definitely rhetoric
[0:32:46] <%X2Eliah> @Blank9 He's literally demonstrating it now
[0:32:47] <%krispen_wa> @x2eliah he cant even imagine why people want to roleplay a character in D&D
[0:32:48] <+Mendin> Pat's Art-Making is 0, but he has solid conceptualization
[0:32:52] <$dudedude55555> woolie is all drama rhetoric, 0 everything else
[0:33:03] <iacus_> the descriptions of the skills say that high levels have disadvantages, but in-game the player always retains control to ignore their extra dialogue options
[0:33:10] <%nicversus> Woolie will figure it out
[0:33:12] <iacus_> so, not really
[0:33:23] <Lancaster_H> @iacus_ not always, but youre mostly right
[0:33:27] <andre11dr> maybe he has a 2 or 1 in physical Instrument
[0:33:38] <Lancaster_H> @iacus_ authority takes over a couple times for sure
[0:33:43] <%wolfofsound> mine is electrochemistry LUL
[0:33:43] <%gatorafan> I'm probably Half-Light daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:33:48] <iaraCatunda> i love your content Mr woolz
[0:33:48] <aiutare47> @iacus_ yes and no, you can get locked out
[0:33:57] <%Vextalyst> cheer500 I believe in you man it was your morning jogging updates that got me going in the beginning I literally had to spend $500 on an oculus to trick my stupid brain and body into exercising so i know the feels Good luck Woolie
[0:34:02] <iacus_> Oh, that's cool then. I didn't know
[0:34:05] <slix3431> I would go with Half-light
[0:34:07] <Indigo_Automaton> You're Conceptualization can be high but it doesn't mean you share tastes with other artists
[0:34:09] <Blank9> conceptualization, but you keep it in your head for the thoughts you go "oh god no"
[0:34:13] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus But which empathy stat
[0:34:16] <gecomaman> The stat is too much of a poet
[0:34:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> my inland empire and empathy are WAY too high lol
[0:34:30] <%the_Punktuation> cool
[0:34:31] <Daxalog> Which stats makes you into an E-Star? Get THOSE.
[0:34:35] <andre11dr> Emphati is also about getting people on your side too
[0:34:39] <@Solidus_113> Woolie's got some Rhetoric with breaking down his views for others to understand, but he still constantly loses debates
[0:34:45] <+BappoTheMighty> Pats 2 highest stats is Drama and Perception.
[0:34:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:34:48] <Lancaster_H> rhetoric, but its low level
[0:34:52] <gecomaman> Volition and espre de corp are the best IMO
[0:34:53] <andre11dr> Actually wait no, im thinking of suggestion
[0:34:53] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:34:55] <CatRidder> shivers
[0:35:11] <user_naim> Woolie might be Conceptualization
[0:35:11] <RaiNiMayonnaise> the internet just has a low logic stat
[0:35:18] <The_Gonzales_Experience> VOLTA DO MAR
[0:35:19] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus you have to cut yourself some slack eventually (and that's coming from me)
[0:35:20] <%justcallmebobplease> VOLITION
[0:35:25] <andre11dr> Volition
[0:35:26] <Lancaster_H> volition
[0:35:32] <+BappoTheMighty> Volition/Logic
[0:35:32] <atgithursdays> We neuro atypical now?
[0:35:34] <+pupil31> SHEEEESH
[0:35:37] <%justcallmebobplease> Volition dude
[0:35:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> Inland empire?
[0:35:46] <%X2Eliah> volition or inland
[0:35:59] <andre11dr> Nah Inland Empire is more of hyper imagination
[0:36:02] <%kewlmyc> That's more volition than logic
[0:36:04] <%krispen_wa> he tries to do logic, but his electrochemistry's hype over vergils and punchgirls overrites it
[0:36:05] <%X2Eliah> logic would be more immediate
[0:36:05] <%gatorafan> Inland for me too sajamGuapo
[0:36:38] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[0:36:38] <CatRidder> esprit de corps
[0:36:39] <Lancaster_H> woolie using rhetoric to explain his volition
[0:36:43] <+xerotwo> Shivers?
[0:36:45] <nailwind> possibly a boring pick but composure for me for sure
[0:36:46] <%X2Eliah> @CatRidder LUL
[0:36:49] <Indigo_Automaton> Logic is like math for ideas
[0:36:52] <%the_Punktuation> cool cool, I appreciate the answer
[0:36:56] <elshadow7> Woolie's rhetoric is compromised.
[0:37:06] <Jaysky> Volition, Inland Empire, Empathy, Logic, Visual Calculus
[0:37:11] <Ids560> Esprit de Quality Assurance
[0:37:16] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  do you have any stat that is over 9? to the point where it's a problem?
[0:37:21] <yomamma133713> the average person sucks at rhetoric tbh
[0:37:29] <+Mr_Pylon> Pat's running a Reaction Speed and Half Light argument strat, hard to beat
[0:37:30] <+walternatorz> Pat is impervious to logical attempts.
[0:37:32] <LlewynMarie> i feel that
[0:37:40] <atgithursdays> The auts is hard
[0:37:41] <%krispen_wa> the decent streamer has to  have a ton of volition to deal with the ONE GUYS
[0:37:44] <$hattrick61> your rhetoric is ok, but the internet's is infinite
[0:37:48] <andre11dr> For me I'd say Inland, Suggestion, Conceptualization,Half Life, Physical Instrument
[0:37:48] <%Deft_Thought> Reggie is clearly big on Half-Light
[0:37:54] <Lancaster_H> reggie has decent savoir faire id say
[0:37:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:37:54] <+walternatorz> interfacing
[0:37:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rhetoric is a difficult stat to level
[0:37:59] <%Deft_Thought> Look at him, he's got a killer's eyes
[0:37:59] <Jaysky> @Mr_Pylon Pat is Pat, and Cuno is Cuno
[0:38:07] <$dudedude55555> reggie is all about elec chem
[0:38:08] <+Mendin> Reggie was a Badmintonier, he has some FYS and MOT
[0:38:18] <iacus_> being on the internet pushed me to turbo-level my Rhetoric
[0:38:22] <The_Gonzales_Experience> Boxing sounds like a Phys Instrument thing
[0:38:27] <andre11dr> My visual Calculus is at 0
[0:38:32] <%kyh9> Reaction speed, physical instrument and Drama for me
[0:38:34] <%X2Eliah> @The_Gonzales_Experience Yeah but he's a novice at it
[0:38:46] <ulcaban> Contextual modifiers
[0:38:46] <atgithursdays> Woolie confirmed for pegging
[0:38:47] <user_naim> Some Composure, Volition, Empathy, Logic, Drama and Conceptualization. Plus a bit of Pain Threshold.
[0:38:49] <enZymeth> High pain threshold dealing with chat
[0:38:51] <%fetrigon> ye that's hand eye coordination and muscle memory
[0:38:58] <%hax_metatron> I think you're supposed to have points in a lot of stats
[0:39:00] <%hax_metatron> Not just 2-3 of them
[0:39:01] <%Deft_Thought> Every nerd has a high Inland Empire
[0:39:03] <%fetrigon> MMMM
[0:39:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woolie has atleast decent phys instrmnt
[0:39:15] <$emptyantics> Woolie has 8 Pain Threshold
[0:39:28] <@Menitta> I like the stats in Lancer. There's stuff like "Apply fists to face"
[0:39:33] <ulcaban> Esprit de Corp for the FGC?
[0:39:36] <iacus_> this rpg system only applies to amnesiac, alcoholic cops
[0:39:37] <%wolfofsound> vomit into shirt is composure
[0:39:40] <andre11dr> Woolie would have a 2 in physical, he seems pretty big
[0:39:48] <andre11dr> or 3 maybe
[0:40:02] <%X2Eliah> Honestly there should be one "reference human" to compare against, as a common baseline
[0:40:05] <The_Gonzales_Experience> Kim has his own exclusive stats, maybe everyone is like that
[0:40:08] <%Seancicle> code-switching is not lost
[0:40:41] <%Seancicle> woolieSHOOK VoteYea
[0:40:41] <CatRidder> rigjt to work

[0:40:53] <%wolfofsound> "do you really like feet?"
[0:40:54] <Inqy833> Espirit de Corp is really one of those "you know what it is if you've ever worked for a big institution or bureaucracy" skills.
[0:40:57] <%BisoromiBear> feet related confrontations
[0:41:30] <%krispen_wa> we all wear masks, spider-man, but which one is real? the one that hides your face or the one that is your face?

[0:46:57] <+AbnormalVoid> high number good, low number bad
[0:47:00] <%krispen_wa> So how would Francis York Morgan react to Disco Elysium man?
[0:47:01] <DSD24> Honor Cop
[0:47:06] <+Prevot> you like communism more than Kim likes you
[0:47:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Theycallmenerf then you're in for a good time.  last session had some strong moments
[0:47:09] <oda_flobunaga> day 3 or later
[0:47:11] <derap41> Can you up the game volume
[0:47:15] <+OblivionSword1> game volume is really low
[0:47:20] <Jaysky> You're black
[0:47:22] <%X2Eliah> Yeah song pickup is day 3 +
[0:47:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Wouldn‚Äôt good cop/bad cop just be a base charisma stat? I‚Äôm going off of Fallout stat knowledge.
[0:47:31] <Dave_VD> Yo chat, given the nature of this game do I have to worry about being 'spoiled' on stuff if I just watch a stream here and there before playing it?
[0:47:33] <sushahana> did he go in the kitchen?
[0:47:35] <ingman112> Game volume is a bit low
[0:47:36] <andre11dr> Wait do you ever find the song after failing the phone thing?
[0:47:37] <%dalmek> @krispen_wa if Disco man had high enough Inland he could probably talk to Zack too
[0:47:38] <Jaysky> Wait, that didn't go as a reply?
[0:47:40] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Just saying but game audio does seem crazy low
[0:47:48] <derap41> Perception(hearing) Failed you hear nothing
[0:47:51] <+Mr_Pylon> Yeah audio very low
[0:47:53] <slix3431> Woolie didn't box enough
[0:47:53] <+OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus volume is really low
[0:47:57] <SomeAsianDood> @dave_vd it's very story focused. easy to get spoiles
[0:48:01] <KaseKaizer> dude has been sleeping all day
[0:48:06] <%JustToWatch> I missed the last session, did Woolie talk to Joyce?
[0:48:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> game audio is low
[0:48:10] <SpartanAltego> The game's audio is quite low, Woolz.
[0:48:14] <Inqy833> @Dave_VD Yes, this is the type of game that can be spoiled, although personally I've had fun playing it even when I've been spoiled on stuff.
[0:48:17] <iacus_> he's not that important
[0:48:23] <derap41> Just a sleeping drunk what could he know
[0:48:26] <%krispen_wa> @justtowatch he did, but not about R E A L I T Y yet
[0:48:29] <andre11dr> Perception: You're black
[0:48:34] <Jaysky> Last I played I upped my phsy and successfully punches big race boy
[0:48:35] <%Seancicle> nous parle au mains
[0:48:36] <+OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus game audio is really low
[0:48:42] <gecomaman> Joyce has more stuff!
[0:48:45] <elshadow7> You can talk to Joyce a bit more if you'd like
[0:48:51] <%thetunnelhomer> Woolievs: Get into Race Theory
[0:48:56] <%Theycallmenerf> I‚Äôve wanted to play this but I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough free time to actually enjoy all it has to offer.
[0:48:58] <%X2Eliah> Yeah footsteps and music is ok now
[0:48:58] <iacus_> you need to find a song and a player to do the karaoke quest
[0:48:59] <+OblivionSword1> ok audio's good now
[0:49:04] <ingman112> Thx woolz
[0:49:05] <%krispen_wa> "Library"
[0:49:07] <yomamma133713> you might wanna go do the measurehead today
[0:49:11] <iacus_> come back tomorrow
[0:49:13] <derap41> at 02:00 times stop you can do whatever for as long as you like
[0:49:13] <%Sunriser41> empathy: man need to go their own way
[0:49:13] <%X2Eliah> Shops are closed
[0:49:14] <+pupil31> LOL
[0:49:16] <vavilonica> Ask Measurehead about his theories
[0:49:16] <Inqy833> Can't karaoke without the right song.
[0:49:16] <$hattrick61> shits locked
[0:49:21] <+Vigonept> once kim goes to be remember to talk to joyce alone
[0:49:22] <ingman112> Nah measurehead for tomorrow
[0:49:22] <+rusefus> sleepy time
[0:49:23] <@Solidus_113> there's stuff directly south you haven't seen
[0:49:25] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[0:49:26] <+OblivionSword1> yeah that's the song
[0:49:27] <%X2Eliah> Some NPCs leave at 22:00, some stick around until 2:00
[0:49:28] <%frickenmoron> Tuck Kim into bed
[0:49:31] <+metzselaar> Kim talk is also an option
[0:49:34] <%dalmek> night is also good for reading stuff without worrying about wasting time
[0:49:41] <+theCatastrophy> see joyce after kim goes to bed
[0:49:43] <%Theycallmenerf> Books? I think you mean a Doujin/smut
[0:49:43] <%JustToWatch> it's almost 11 and I NEED an autobiography of a famous person
[0:49:46] <gecomaman> Never finished all her dialogue remember?
[0:49:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LEDGER
[0:50:00] <Inqy833> You could ditch Kim and then do all the FUN things he won't let you do while supervised.
[0:50:04] <laserbeaming> Compartment Time
[0:50:06] <%X2Eliah> hidden compo
[0:50:06] <%krispen_wa> Just keep examining the mug
[0:50:07] <Dave_VD> @SomeAsianDood @Inqy833 Okay thank you! I figured since there are so many ways that situations can play out I would be safe just watching a stream or two. I've had to dodge a lot of streams between this and 13 sentinels
[0:50:08] <SomeAsianDood> they haven't debriefed yet have they
[0:50:08] <ingman112> Yeah you‚Äôre very limited with what you can do right now. No shame in calling it a night after some reading/Joyce chatting
[0:50:13] <%krispen_wa> until you get mega racist
[0:50:14] <andre11dr> Now i did not sleep a night and nothing really happened, does sleeping actually matter?
[0:50:19] <iacus_> oh the compartment. I did that recently in my own 2nd playthrough
[0:50:25] <+rusefus> cmon
[0:50:28] <iacus_> let's see how he handles it

[0:51:44] <Inqy833> @Dave_VD I think the best way to think of it is that Disco Elysium is a murder mystery. But it's a really well written one with lots of layers where the murder isn't actually what the story is about.

[1:00:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Btw white mourning ain't bad
[1:00:55] <aiutare47> Cutscene damage
[1:01:03] <%hax_metatron> Read the ledger description
[1:01:13] <SomeAsianDood> @llewynmarie his nickname implies his burnt out ruins
[1:01:22] <+MrAtheGreat> Indotribe ain't bad either

[1:01:41] <derap41> Now this is interesting
[1:01:52] <iacus_> I got caustic echo instead and the ledger turned into something else
[1:01:54] <slix3431> @eashw Grats
[1:01:58] <+Javaa01> It gives you *perspective*
[1:01:58] <+za7az> It's pretty good
[1:02:06] <+Mendin> Reminder that since you finished Jammy Vu, Joyce has something new to talk about regarding Reality
[1:02:08] <+MrAtheGreat> @eashw CONGRATS PogChamp PogChamp SeemsGood

[1:02:26] <+projectmanatees> dem stats tho
[1:02:28] <+MrAtheGreat> LUL
[1:02:28] <%hax_metatron> You can equip ledger now too
[1:02:28] <$emptyantics> THE FUCKING WRITING BibleThump
[1:02:29] <aiutare47> Joyce might be a good person to talk to now
[1:02:31] <GarbageNirvana> Depending on where you open that up you have an option to let the letter blow away in the wind
[1:02:31] <+IvesNapalm> Check those stats
[1:02:34] <derap41> What does it give you
[1:02:34] <mr_sups> Heal that Morale. You need some of that Volition
[1:02:35] <SolSwagGuy56> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[1:02:39] <Blank9> can still read the ledger itself
[1:02:39] <LlewynMarie> @SomeAsianDood that's true
[1:02:40] <%krispen_wa> YER A HARRY, WIZARD
[1:02:41] <reonome> NotLikeThis

[1:02:53] <miucsa51> DIRTY HARRY
[1:02:55] <laserbeaming> you can equip it for bonuses!
[1:03:01] <derap41> Blue Hearty
[1:03:02] <soundcloud_raptor> yer eye nal
[1:03:07] <+eashw> YOU RINE AL CLEANER
[1:03:08] <+IvesNapalm> Those stat increases are so good
[1:03:09] <%X2Eliah> Yeah that was the main thing
[1:03:10] <SolSwagGuy56> No wonder we threw it out
[1:03:14] <ToxInjection> LUL YE
[1:03:14] <Canadian_Suit> i can't wait for the next CONTENT button (red check)
[1:03:17] <%X2Eliah> you have basically completed the ledger now
[1:03:17] <Chatterbox1991> you get more stuff if you look at the gum wrapper now
[1:03:28] <ToxInjection> awh, damn it.
[1:03:30] <%Theycallmenerf> [Paperback Writer] [Guess who] [Who Are You]
[1:03:30] <derap41> Made you into a feely dude
[1:03:40] <elshadow7> @GarbageNirvana is that location based? I thought it was stat based?
[1:03:47] <%X2Eliah> AS IT SHOULD
[1:03:49] <dds333a> Authority takes hits
[1:03:49] <mr_sups> 1 Volition
[1:03:51] <LordOfThePoultry> THATS BAD
[1:03:52] <Blank9> authority rules
[1:03:55] <+walternatorz> what cop has authority holding a note pad?
[1:03:58] <+IvesNapalm> That inland empire increase should allow a reroll?
[1:03:58] <srv4254> authority and electro chem seem to do more harm than good
[1:03:59] <primaryfire> authority is cool
[1:04:01] <derap41> Auth is overated just  be a doormap
[1:04:04] <%X2Eliah> Authority is just the racist stat
[1:04:05] <+walternatorz> other than Kim
[1:04:05] <KaseKaizer> I am the law?
[1:04:05] <+projectmanatees> jesus that volation is low
[1:04:07] <Johannen> One cannot establish authority if you cannot handle looking at yourself in the mirror)
[1:04:08] <DSD24> @walternatorz Cole Phelps?
[1:04:09] <LlewynMarie> Holding thing ledger gives you +1
[1:04:10] <ingman112> You can interact with the photo as well, if you didn‚Äôt already
[1:04:12] <Inqy833> Turns out being sensitive and understanding makes it harder to walk all over people.
[1:04:16] <linSP> you need a LITTLE facism
[1:04:16] <ToxInjection> Remember, you're Cuno
[1:04:17] <Blank9> authority's never racist
[1:04:18] <shakespearo> @X2Eliah Nah that's Phys Instrument
[1:04:21] <derap41> Stat up
[1:04:23] <andre11dr> A lot of shit takes down authority early on
[1:04:27] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah well both tbh
[1:04:27] <%nicversus> un peu de fascism
[1:04:32] <laserbeaming> Authority is not as bad as chat says.
[1:04:40] <+IvesNapalm> Violation stat drops as you take damage
[1:04:42] <%krispen_wa> authority has a lot of uses
[1:04:46] <derap41> Authority is an asshole 90% of the time
[1:04:54] <Inqy833> Authority is a very useful skill with bad opinions.
[1:04:55] <+MrAtheGreat> Authority is one of the best stats in the game so maybe keep that in mind
[1:04:58] <+OblivionSword1> it'll be useful for some things
[1:04:58] <derap41> but somtimes you need an asshole
[1:04:58] <%bread_assassin> Endurance is the stat that governs fascism. IF any stat is racist, it's that one.
[1:05:00] <Ids560> authority does let you do one of the best checks in the game
[1:05:02] <available_line> @IvesNapalm Volition
[1:05:08] <%X2Eliah> @Inqy833 That'sa very good summary of it yeah
[1:05:10] <SomeAsianDood> authority has no chill, but sometimes u need no chill
[1:05:11] <+rusefus> let kim sleep
[1:05:12] <DSD24> Joyce is a nice name
[1:05:12] <srv4254> authority is wrong and a dick at most of the time
[1:05:14] <laserbeaming> Authority is an asshole, but a very useful asshole
[1:05:15] <Blank9> It's not even much of an asshole unless you're brainless and think you have to use it everytime
[1:05:19] <$emptyantics> I feel like you can‚Äôt have high Authority without being some kind of asshole in real life
[1:05:22] <sushahana> joyce talk is long
[1:05:23] <derap41> @srv4254 But he gets it done
[1:05:24] <%hax_metatron> Chat let it happen, don't get carried away by the hype and spoil
[1:05:27] <dds333a> Physical Instrument is great, and my favorite, but boy can he be fricking intrusive in actual stuff
[1:05:27] <gecomaman> Plenty still to talk to her about
[1:05:31] <mr_sups> Joyce is up Late
[1:05:32] <LegitBarnacleBoy> CHAT SHUT UP
[1:05:35] <+pupil31> Damn she just chillin
[1:05:47] <LlewynMarie> oh I thought the ledge gave you +1 authority, does that change if you read the letter?

[1:07:11] <FassieFons> watch out for them snake eyes
[1:07:11] <%hax_metatron> yes
[1:07:15] <LunarRemix> The game tells you can  do it later but you can do it right now if you want to
[1:07:16] <%hax_metatron> Do it all
[1:07:16] <%JustToWatch> yes it said in order
[1:07:16] <nelsonsaysbooya> Then take your time homes
[1:07:17] <%wolfofsound> crits, "So I met a black"
[1:07:18] <iacus_> it just said to start with the first one
[1:07:19] <primaryfire> I don't think they meant the checks?
[1:07:21] <%hax_metatron> TAKE YOUR TIME
[1:07:22] <%thetunnelhomer> Just do it
[1:07:22] <ingman112> Yep yep

[1:07:34] <%Koopardon> [‚Ä¢] [‚Ä¢]
[1:07:36] <Oddere> you should have some clothes by now that buff your espirit de corps
[1:07:46] <shakespearo> ditch that stick-in-the-mud Kim when you talk to her again.
[1:07:47] <dds333a> And Kim recommends not to take in too much
[1:07:48] <%krispen_wa> joyce unironically has such a way with words
[1:07:58] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus It's not that big of a deal if you fail that Esprit de Corps check

[1:19:29] <megamirk> I agree with not shooting people in the head, unless they're communists

[1:19:36] <%fudgex453> "morality is bad" woolie 2021

[1:22:49] <+Prevot> Joyce is like "I know pain too"
[1:22:49] <+pupil31> The worst kind of suffering
[1:22:50] <dds333a> That is agony
[1:22:54] <shakespearo> Joyce brokw down in quarantine and ate bread
[1:22:54] <%X2Eliah> The biggest suffering is not being able to go see a comedy show at a club
[1:22:56] <+MrAtheGreat> I can't eat ice cream I'm sufferingh
[1:22:57] <%fudgex453> my boat doesnt have ac

[1:23:01] <ingman112> Joyce ain‚Äôt no moralist
[1:23:16] <+mads_valentine> FREE MARKET
[1:23:19] <derap41> Its pretty obvious what Joyce is
[1:23:20] <andre11dr> Joyce is definitely a capitalist
[1:23:28] <Inqy833> @X2Eliah But in a couple of hundred years, your great great grandchildren might get a share in a boating concern.

[1:23:36] <Indigo_Automaton> That's exactly what it is
[1:23:38] <Deasmeister> So easy west Germany
[1:23:39] <Lelfro> a post-Soviet state, you mean?
[1:23:42] <%X2Eliah> Exactly
[1:23:44] <LegitBarnacleBoy> Like half of eastern europe
[1:23:46] <dds333a> Hmmmmm
[1:23:46] <elshadow7> That is correct
[1:23:47] <derap41> hmmmmmmmmmm....mmmmhmhmm
[1:23:47] <ToxInjection> Like mass-scale gentrification
[1:23:49] <Oddere> they did kind of try and take over the world
[1:23:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Like IMPERIALISM you say?
[1:23:50] <lyzejag> They also step in before not after
[1:23:50] <ingman112> 100 percent
[1:23:52] <+metzselaar> Where was this game made?
[1:23:54] <Ids560> she is

[1:24:10] <lyzejag> American imperialism
[1:24:12] <%Sunriser41> joyce has some strong hillary clinton energy
[1:24:12] <aiutare47> Wiemar, sure, or a post soviet nation
[1:24:18] <Hydrapissed> like america and the south lol
[1:24:20] <megamirk> I wonder how much of this was inspired by Estonian history
[1:24:23] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie now going Fascist route damn those foreigners
[1:24:25] <andre11dr> Like most of Eastern Europe
[1:24:28] <dds333a> In an MGS context, one could say the establishment of Outer Heaven/Haven
[1:24:28] <derap41> @Hydrapissed Bingo
[1:24:28] <ingman112> Post WWII was a crazy time
[1:24:32] <CatRidder> checoslovakia
[1:24:34] <%hax_metatron> Because you don't have money to eat
[1:24:35] <SomeAsianDood> almost like the Soviet bloc
[1:24:37] <Pappajimbo> serbia
[1:24:41] <shakespearo> Weimar is like a pretty hilarious bumblefuck. Or it would be if it hadn't directly resulted in WW2
[1:24:44] <+pupil31> SIPP Yep those were the days
[1:24:44] <iacus_> it's like a mix of easter europe and... chapo nonsense

[1:24:50] <$dudedude55555> grandpas are sleeping
[1:24:50] <Oddere> I like that revachol has had pretty much every political system and each one has failed it
[1:24:55] <Inqy833> Joyce is far enough up the conservative great chain of being that she can afford to be honest about it. Always interesting talking to the truly upper class conservatives like that.
[1:24:56] <miucsa51> Yep
[1:24:57] <+metzselaar> @livingdynamo @procrastiamus @SomeAsianDood Thanks
[1:24:57] <Iwashi94> a lot of it is very inspired by Eastern Europe and the ex-soviet countries I think
[1:24:58] <megamirk> masss cultureee
[1:25:01] <%kyh9> More than that: the definition of ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù expands greatly when things change too quicjly
[1:25:02] <derap41> POP Culture
[1:25:12] <elshadow7> Thanks logic
[1:25:33] <dds333a> "FRIVOLOUS Pop culture"

[1:26:11] <derap41> educated you mean?
[1:26:16] <%ppangboi> Joyce definitely has a view from the top
[1:26:17] <iacus_> That's exaclty it, woolie
[1:26:17] <ToxInjection> That teen working the Frittte store is probably one
[1:26:21] <%hax_metatron> In some countries being centrist is literally demonic.
[1:26:23] <dukenux> the 80s
[1:26:27] <$dudedude55555> manana doesn't care

[1:27:02] <%fudgex453> new thought slot?
[1:27:03] <ToxInjection> Cuno's not a voter!
[1:27:05] <+OblivionSword1> pump more into shivers
[1:27:06] <munitalprats> another thought
[1:27:09] <Fuji808> The girl at Freittte is literally that, Woolie. Young, destroyed people, disinterested in the rubble they live on.
[1:27:09] <munitalprats> get another thought :)
[1:27:10] <lyzejag> Volition yeaaah
[1:27:10] <DSD24> Shivers only playthough
[1:27:11] <%X2Eliah> Do what you want
[1:27:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:27:12] <derap41> thoughts?
[1:27:12] <Oddere> espirit for that check?
[1:27:13] <+mads_valentine> Jamias Vu!
[1:27:16] <elshadow7> That Volition's pretty low
[1:27:16] <Project205> Volition is goat
[1:27:16] <ingman112> Volition might need a boost
[1:27:16] <+MrAtheGreat> Volition is one of the best stats
[1:27:18] <the_allturtle> What happend to the Paris commune is more simillar to what happend to Revachol. The eastern block wasn't really chrushed by forcefull internationalist intervention. But there are of course other parallells to post-soviet countries.
[1:27:18] <dds333a> The good old Bubble economy
[1:27:23] <%gatorafan> you do you daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:27:23] <Ids560> as pat said 5 isn't as important as 6
[1:27:24] <derap41> Thoughts do a lot more than stats
[1:27:26] <Blank9> getting all the shivers already
[1:27:27] <+Vivaciousx3> save it for a check
[1:27:29] <Iwashi94> level half light?
[1:27:30] <SomeAsianDood> volition is cuz morale damage
[1:27:32] <primaryfire> you should aim to get any thought you like up to 4 at least
[1:27:33] <LlewynMarie> Empathy
[1:27:33] <dukenux> prolly safe to give Volition
[1:27:33] <andre11dr> As a man from eastern Europe, most people know the history, but they don't care about it ,because " fuck those people, we ain't that anymore"
[1:27:33] <$dudedude55555> you want those thoughts tho
[1:27:35] <%hax_metatron> Volition for sure
[1:27:35] <dukenux> *to
[1:27:38] <Fuji808> Boost the stats that help you redo checks.
[1:27:38] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus What white checks do you have to redo?
[1:27:40] <asdief_> Volition
[1:27:40] <iacus_> save it for another check
[1:27:41] <+OblivionSword1> max shivers out why not
[1:27:43] <%X2Eliah> Shivers
[1:27:46] <%ppangboi> shivers at 4 is safe to stay for a bit
[1:27:46] <sushahana> shivers high is too good
[1:27:47] <pillowheadgirl> Volition is my dude
[1:27:48] <%X2Eliah> Go shivers
[1:27:48] <+MrAtheGreat> yeah it's 3 right now
[1:27:49] <bonebagMEL> Volition is VERY Important
[1:27:50] <yomamma133713> save it, honestly
[1:27:50] <primaryfire> at 4 you get more passive checks
[1:27:51] <CatRidder> thoughts are more important, some of them give you bonus xp
[1:27:54] <dukenux> Even numbers, right?
[1:27:55] <%hax_metatron> More morale is good, Volition. You'll get toins of points later
[1:27:57] <%X2Eliah> He has 3 volition
[1:27:59] <Indigo_Automaton> Volition is good
[1:28:01] <munitalprats> Volition is cool too
[1:28:02] <%superc37> volition for sure
[1:28:03] <derap41> Shivers is 4 right now that more than enough
[1:28:05] <elshadow7> Solid
[1:28:09] <andre11dr> Volition is just always good
[1:28:15] <%krispen_wa> man this music is V I B E S
[1:28:15] <ToxInjection> Volition was at a 1? LUL
[1:28:16] <DSD24> You still need to get your morale up

[1:28:30] <CatRidder> dont heal
[1:28:33] <%X2Eliah> You want to hear it you gotta keep it healed
[1:28:36] <derap41> health affect stats do they not+
[1:28:37] <Oddere> u heal when you sleep i thin
[1:28:39] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus It does not talk as Shivers or Inland Empire that much
[1:28:39] <%fudgex453> sleep heals
[1:28:40] <%X2Eliah> Dont do it now
[1:28:40] <ingman112> Don‚Äôt heal now, you‚Äôll heal when you sleep
[1:28:41] <%X2Eliah> ofc
[1:28:41] <Ids560> I think sleeping heals you
[1:28:43] <elshadow7> You'll get free heals in a couple of hours
[1:28:45] <laserbeaming> healing items are cheap, don't worry to heal
[1:28:46] <%krispen_wa> he'll heal when he sleeps
[1:28:51] <Asuterisuku> It's late. You should go to bed.
[1:28:51] <lyzejag> If it's not healed you will not hear it also, but you can sleep soon
[1:28:57] <DSD24> Two different answers
[1:29:01] <CatRidder> 2
[1:29:07] <derap41> Was GME luck?
[1:29:08] <iacus_> it's always luck
[1:29:09] <Hydrapissed> a wise gamble or a lucky guess
[1:29:12] <%X2Eliah> What would you pick Reg?
[1:29:18] <yomamma133713> 100% luck
[1:29:19] <+MrAtheGreat> was it lucky to choose the guys with the guns
[1:29:21] <derap41> Was Tesla Luck?
[1:29:34] <%kyh9> It‚Äôs not luck that the corporation sided with the capitalist forces
[1:29:34] <iacus_> but it's literally as arbitrary as that
[1:29:36] <AMaidIndeed> Luck only works if you can capitalize on it
[1:29:36] <+Prevot> luck is a skill
[1:29:37] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You chose wisely sounds approving though?
[1:29:38] <derap41> are we throwing dice on the market here
[1:29:38] <dds333a> You could take this way further
[1:29:39] <CatRidder> luck is a skill
[1:29:43] <+procrastiamus> luck and a whole lot of union breaking
[1:29:45] <AMaidIndeed> luck is a skill
[1:29:49] <%gatorafan> woolieMINHMAX
[1:29:51] <Lelfro> they picked a side, they didn't do anything
[1:29:56] <iacus_> it's not reductionist, how could they heve predicted the winning side?
[1:29:57] <Johannen> But what if you had to choose one of the fighters and not participate yourself?
[1:29:57] <nelsonsaysbooya> We all know it's only 10% luck
[1:29:59] <lyzejag> "Lucky' means killing all the communist i guess
[1:30:01] <Ids560> I mean picking a side when it's not clear who's gonna win is lucky
[1:30:11] <derap41> oh this is interesting
[1:30:19] <dds333a> I agree, but one could really make the point that it is
[1:30:22] <DSD24> Bitches love cannons

[1:35:47] <Lancaster_H> PANDEMIC
[1:35:49] <Indigo_Automaton> Not drugs
[1:35:50] <Pappajimbo> oh how the turntables
[1:35:51] <derap41> Prion
[1:35:51] <%hax_metatron> No Pandemic
[1:35:53] <%X2Eliah> 2 implies something
[1:35:54] <elshadow7> The pandemic
[1:35:54] <Oddere> coke and a lot of energy drink companies do a lot of 'sportswashing' where they sponsor and advertise using athletes to make their product seem healthier
[1:35:54] <+PkSilent01> KILL EM ALL
[1:35:55] <munitalprats> KILL THEM ALL
[1:35:58] <%hax_metatron> Solve the Pandemic with some intelligent solution
[1:35:58] <+Vivaciousx3> pandemic
[1:35:58] <Indigo_Automaton> There was a pandemic that drove people violent
[1:35:59] <%X2Eliah> Prion pandemic
[1:36:00] <+metzselaar> That was the pandemic
[1:36:02] <derap41> Prion melting brains
[1:36:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> how would you stop the coof
[1:36:05] <ingman112> Medical solution
[1:36:05] <+RoByte2> It was basically mad cow disease
[1:36:06] <Project205> It was a pandemic that started it all
[1:36:07] <Oddere> when in reality those people would almost never touch liquid sugar
[1:36:07] <aiutare47> She's asking how you wouldve avoided the collapse
[1:36:09] <Deasmeister> 2  implies communists are insane
[1:36:10] <yomamma133713> KILL THEM
[1:36:10] <DSD24> 2 was what I went with
[1:36:10] <EternalJedi> tzaraath was the prion disease
[1:36:11] <Hydrapissed> kill em all lol
[1:36:12] <Ids560> it's the prion disease that people overthrew governments for mishandling
[1:36:15] <%Javaa01> @hax_metatron It's a figure of speech
[1:36:17] <munitalprats> k-k-k-kill em all
[1:36:19] <LegitBarnacleBoy> it's a prion disease
[1:36:22] <munitalprats> i k-k-k-kill em all!
[1:36:23] <+MrAtheGreat> COVID!
[1:36:24] <AngryAsian5> It was the prion disease
[1:36:28] <Inqy833> I'd say it implies a technocratic solution, rather than a communist/capitalist one.
[1:36:31] <%gatorafan> uuuhhhhh I remember when Pat picked an answer he got fascist points btw
[1:36:33] <+MrAtheGreat> a little lower
[1:36:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> further down i think
[1:36:35] <+OblivionSword1> it was a really bad pandemic
[1:36:40] <Lancaster_H> you skipped the option to ask more about the disease @WoolieVersus
[1:36:43] <vavilonica> Choose the kill one
[1:36:48] <sushahana> her theme Kreygasm
[1:36:48] <derap41> Prions pandemic caused the revoluion
[1:36:50] <%chandlerofearth> The prion disease led to the government falling apart, and then the communists took over
[1:36:52] <vavilonica> It‚Äôs the coolest one
[1:36:52] <%gatorafan> read the answers carefully
[1:36:52] <%X2Eliah> It's hard to figure out what it is fully implying
[1:36:53] <+mads_valentine> IT SAYS WHAT IS SAYS
[1:36:53] <shakespearo> Can't get sick if u're dead
[1:36:53] <laserbeaming> The catalyst for the revolution was a Pandemic. Not the real cause, but the excuse
[1:36:53] <+Vivaciousx3> thats what its implying
[1:36:58] <elshadow7> A solution to the pandemic that ended up causing the revolutin
[1:37:02] <ingman112> Medical moderation vs. kill more vs. selfish positioning vs.  who knows
[1:37:19] <Indigo_Automaton> It did
[1:37:20] <dukenux> pandemic was just a spark i think
[1:37:23] <vavilonica> Kill kill kill kill
[1:37:23] <+MrAtheGreat> They took advantage of a country ravaged by the pandemic
[1:37:24] <derap41> yesn't
[1:37:24] <andre11dr> Go with your gut KILL EM ALL
[1:37:26] <aiutare47> thats the question
[1:37:27] <+Sir_Louis> (that's the fascist option)
[1:37:28] <Inqy833> More like the suffering caused by the pandemic was the spark that lit the fuse.
[1:37:32] <DSD24> tendrils is a good word
[1:37:42] <derap41> Skull drill
[1:37:51] <Hydrapissed> lol just stop the omega death

[1:37:57] <Lancaster_H> you can go back to it iirc @WoolieVersus
[1:37:59] <+metzselaar> You can circle back around
[1:37:59] <dukenux> privatized healthcare LUL
[1:38:06] <+MrAtheGreat> 4 is so defeatist LUL
[1:38:07] <derap41> 2 is HARDCORE
[1:38:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> Legitimately it's impossible, prions are scary yo
[1:38:08] <+Kataguro> 2 is very 40K
[1:38:10] <%X2Eliah> damn
[1:38:10] <megamirk> yeah, modest social care will fix a pandemic of deadly protein
[1:38:11] <Inqy833> Moralist, fascist or ultraliberal
[1:38:15] <Hydrapissed> it SOUNDS personal
[1:38:22] <derap41> There is no cure for Any Prions disease
[1:38:25] <lyzejag> 3 just makes me angry
[1:38:28] <%X2Eliah> These are such unfair options xD
[1:38:29] <CatRidder> 4

[1:38:59] <%kyh9> Quarter of humanity
[1:38:59] <dds333a> 4 is the correct response. don't bother, it won't help in the end
[1:39:00] <pi_in_the_sci> Mad Cow Disease is a prion disease
[1:39:01] <Pt_Kamen> Mad Cow Disease is Prionic
[1:39:04] <+babyacid> its mad cow
[1:39:05] <sendart> AVE IMPERATOR shatter their skys
[1:39:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> Remember mad cow's disease? They set fire to ENTIRE HERDS OF COWS to get rid of them

[1:39:19] <CatRidder> spanish flu
[1:39:19] <AMaidIndeed> Mad Cow Disease
[1:39:21] <ingman112> All you need to know is ultra bad. Prions can change their shape to latch onto other proteins; they can be frozen for extended periods of time and still live. They are nigh unkillable outside of heat
[1:39:22] <derap41> Dementia
[1:39:22] <dukenux> Brains turn into sponge
[1:39:23] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Mad Cow Disease

[1:39:56] <derap41> Parkinsons Dementia erratic behavior Prion FUCK you up
[1:40:00] <dukenux> yeah, whole cow heards where slaughtered and burned
[1:40:04] <shakespearo> Prions roll up in your crib and convince all your bro-proteins that they should be cool and sexy like the prion. And then you die
[1:40:04] <+rusefus> load up the cannons
[1:40:05] <derap41> Mink Covid
[1:40:05] <aiutare47> Minks due to a covid infection
[1:40:06] <+Prevot> and then stopped doing the things that caused mad cow disease
[1:40:07] <DSD24> Stinkmink's are cute in MH Rise
[1:40:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> Kill and set on fire, it made the country smell of bacon
[1:40:09] <Inqy833> "Murder all the angry people who are rising up against the government" seems kinda... right wing.
[1:40:10] <Oddere> you dont
[1:40:11] <munitalprats> k-k-k-kill em all!
[1:40:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you literally can't
[1:40:15] <%X2Eliah> Also for Covid. Minks were killed in Denmark for covid
[1:40:19] <munitalprats> you dont. you cleanse them with artillery fire!
[1:40:21] <+MrAtheGreat> It literally melted minds @WoolieVersus
[1:40:22] <%chandlerofearth> I think 2 is the fascist option, because you're calling them diseased dogs
[1:40:23] <+mads_valentine> Woolie, *dogs* means Communists in this case
[1:40:24] <AnneSQF> Yep, mink covid
[1:40:29] <dukenux> You can't treat it as other diseases
[1:40:36] <Hydrapissed> kill em all lol
[1:40:36] <Pt_Kamen> You don't treat Prionic Disease, it's game over
[1:40:37] <ingman112> They‚Äôre not zombies, just rapidly decomposing while alive
[1:40:38] <%DiscoMatador> Replace Dogs with Commies

[1:48:14] <heemwizard> there is one person in a container....
[1:48:15] <LunarRemix> You can hustle and pay for you hostel
[1:48:16] <aiutare47> Keep in mind Joyce is a professional negotiator. Her job is to make people like her.

[1:48:36] <dukenux> If you're a communist cop, maybe she can become your Engels
[1:48:37] <heemwizard> also with enough authority you can bring down the debt to 30
[1:49:00] <GarbageNirvana> she reminds me of someone
[1:49:01] <%X2Eliah> BOMBED OUT BUILDINGS
[1:49:20] <GarbageNirvana> like not Judy dench but Judi dench adjacent

[1:50:23] <Zomner> Joyce is my favorite character because of SPOILERS
[1:50:23] <LunarRemix> Love for Revachol
[1:50:27] <Inqy833> Joyce is far enough up the capitalist totem pole that she can be honest about who she is and what she wants. So she doesn't self-deceive in the same way a lot of the other right-wing NPCs do.
[1:50:27] <+rusefus> Joyce partied back in the day

[1:50:59] <ToxInjection> I mean, that don't have to mean anything

[1:52:40] <derap41> Big brain
[1:52:54] <%nicversus> a place called the cock and bull got dicked out of its original location by shithead land mogul
[1:53:00] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Omg my town does this and it‚Äôs awful

[1:53:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[1:53:15] <ToxInjection> I feel like Montreal would piss me off if I ever decided to visit
[1:53:17] <dukenux> DAMN
[1:53:17] <derap41> Cheaper than rent
[1:53:24] <%X2Eliah> That's so fucked up but also makes sense
[1:53:29] <Hydrapissed> LAND is a business lol
[1:53:32] <Lelfro> sounds like a hustle
[1:53:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i kinda can't be that mad it's kinda smart
[1:53:46] <dukenux> This is like an advanced version of parking meter fairy
[1:53:48] <+Hayajin_> it was already impossible
[1:53:49] <Inqy833> And hey presto, a fine magically changes into a tax.
[1:53:49] <+Prevot> *taps forehead*
[1:53:53] <sushahana> quite an INDIRECT mode of taxation that is
[1:53:55] <+Hayajin_> without paying anyway
[1:53:55] <%X2Eliah> And that's what leads to fucked up parking fees and in city congestions
[1:53:58] <%nicversus> THINK MONTREAL THINK
[1:54:02] <aewheros> Well, it's sort of like paying rent. But totally a hustle.
[1:54:02] <dukenux> screw rules, i have MONEY
[1:54:06] <aiutare47> sounds like a racket, especially if you have friends who sell parking
[1:54:15] <QuicksilverMachine> that sounds like "the city doesnt care" is the problem
[1:54:15] <twoto858> No matter what kind of economic system, these people will figure out how to make the most money
[1:54:34] <+MrAtheGreat> LittleKuriboh was dead the hell on with that Kaiba line
[1:54:36] <CatRidder> this is mine
[1:54:39] <dukenux> That's why the scalpers can scalps
[1:54:42] <%X2Eliah> DESTROY ALL CARS
[1:54:43] <derap41> Same thing with Million Dollar fines for billion dollar profits
[1:54:45] <%jinking79> and he want ine slot machine
[1:54:53] <Ids560> yeah systems that let people do that are bad systems
[1:54:55] <dukenux> as long as they don't hurt the bottom line, no one will stop them
[1:55:09] <%nicversus> though in fairness, inner cities need more pedestrian exclusive spaces
[1:55:13] <dukenux> Art Nouveau is old too
[1:55:28] <Inqy833> Land ownership is an illusion like that.
[1:55:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:55:29] <lyzejag> "Noveau" ? Is it not supposed to be "Nouveau" ?
[1:55:37] <DSD24> Would Joyce have a gold suit like the Noveau Rich Guy from Yakuza 0?

[2:16:44] <$hattrick61> pretty close
[2:16:44] <mr_sups> Shattered Disco Ball
[2:16:49] <$lumporr> i think the thing that fucks with visualizing isolas/the pale is that there's no reference to visualize from. if you're in the pale, you're in the pale. you can't see the isolas
[2:16:51] <%alpharius88> like malacor V?
[2:16:53] <+mads_valentine> Antimatter is not a void.
[2:16:55] <+MrAtheGreat> Floating on an ocean in my mind
[2:16:56] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  an archipeligo surrounded by endless sea
[2:16:56] <Fuji808> A fog of war that never goes away.
[2:16:57] <%Javaa01> Like that statue

[2:17:03] <%hax_metatron> DISCO
[2:17:04] <aewheros> We're still orbiting the sun. The pale orbits along with us.
[2:17:04] <+choopercabra> Islands floating in a cloudy void
[2:17:05] <+Jiggisnipe> think Kotor maybe
[2:17:05] <$lumporr> like there's no "above" to view from

[2:17:11] <%kyh9> REGGIE
[2:17:11] <Lelfro> someone put points in conceptionalization
[2:17:12] <dukenux> In Planescape the city was a disk on top of a giant needle, and there was no sun
[2:17:15] <UvBenServed> Disco planet cracking
[2:17:16] <gecomaman> For sure Woolie

[2:17:30] <Johannen> Reggie succeded a conceptualization check)
[2:17:31] <%krispen_wa> would it even be endless darkness? how does one imagine...nothing?
[2:17:32] <Zomner> I thought it was what the image of Inland Empire represented
[2:17:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sonic unleashed planet when it explodes
[2:17:32] <thebalticguy1> IMPOSSIBLE CONCEPTUALIZATION CHECK

[2:19:30] <Johannen> KIm is 100 logical...it might be to hard for him to comprehend
[2:19:31] <Eger007> he's scared?
[2:19:31] <Chatterbox1991> you'll see in about a minute
[2:19:31] <$lumporr> @hax_metatron nailed it
[2:19:32] <%wolfofsound> Guys he'll get to that
[2:19:32] <%xcompleasedad> She will talk about this in a bit
[2:19:35] <aewheros> Kim doesn't want YOU to have all this heaped upon your fragile mind
[2:19:36] <%Sunriser41> this is basic woolie
[2:19:37] <yomamma133713> its literally the apocalypse, obviously he doesnt want to talk about it
[2:19:38] <+Mr_Pylon> You'll see
[2:19:38] <dukenux> I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of Pale makes him incredibly uncomfortablwe
[2:19:38] <$hattrick61> Litterally dont let it set in
[2:19:39] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe you can ask him later
[2:19:39] <DSD24> Don't forget you had that Medical Episode
[2:19:41] <%Irridium> He may not want you learning about this and having an existential crisis
[2:19:41] <%kyh9> It's the most basic shit
[2:19:41] <SomeAsianDood> doesn't want u to break your mind over this shit
[2:19:47] <ingman112> We‚Äôll get to that
[2:19:47] <CatRidder> he doesnt wanna think about this
[2:19:47] <%X2Eliah> this is 100% real
[2:19:48] <%hax_metatron> Kim: Don't let it set in
[2:19:50] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's because everyone knows this and you're clearly not exactly a stable individual lol @woolieversus
[2:19:51] <miucsa51> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[2:19:51] <gecomaman> He tried to stop you talking about this twice, three times actually
[2:19:52] <%Sunriser41> pale is the setting in made manifest
[2:19:53] <nakunattakage> chat he'll figure it all out in like 10 minutes just chill LUL
[2:19:53] <Inqy833> It's like not wanting to hear about global warming... if global warming had manifested as a mysterious void-force that had already shattered the world.
[2:19:53] <%dalmek> you DID pass out reading a note in your ledger
[2:19:55] <+MrAtheGreat> Kim didn't want YOU to hear it, because he didn't think you could stand it. @WoolieVersus
[2:19:56] <Robot_Nixon_> Hey kids, entropy is upon us NotLikeThis
[2:19:58] <dukenux> Kim don't want to set it in. He's too much of a realist
[2:19:59] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> He knows and does not need to think about it all the time
[2:20:01] <%kyh9> Everyone knows this stuff.  He didn't want Harry to know
[2:20:01] <zanzibarian_hamster> Not everyone wants to talk about how the true vacuum can happen at any moment and just fucking destroy the universe, it's a pretty heavy concept
[2:20:05] <Asuterisuku> It's now after midnight, but it still says Day 1.
[2:20:06] <shakespearo> Kim fails to see how you learning about the existential dread inherent to the world will aid the investigation, infact he think it will hinder it
[2:20:07] <Karhax> Can't let it set in
[2:20:08] <%justcallmebobplease> Kim was protecting your broken, busted ass.
[2:20:08] <%kyh9> He was afraid Harry wouldn't be able to handle it
[2:20:14] <ToxInjection> what a bonkers fucking setting. So cool.
[2:20:14] <@Solidus_113> it's not the investigation
[2:20:14] <+Vivaciousx3> it's alike learning about space for the first time
[2:20:15] <+ALazo> maybe he doesn't want you to have a meltdown when you learn about the basic nature of the universe
[2:20:16] <aiutare47> Wools you had a heart attack from remembering your near past, the entropy of the universe would be too much for healthy folks
[2:20:20] <andre11dr> I'm surprised that Woolie trusts her this much
[2:20:24] <+SammyOVision> He was afraid of your reaction
[2:20:25] <+Sunriser41> with the pale you dont have an option of not letting it set in
[2:20:28] <AvroEltz> Maybe joyce will give you a reason, speak to her maybe
[2:20:29] <derap41> I mean imagine if she tried to explain SpaceTime
[2:20:38] <andre11dr> she could just be nuts for all you know
[2:20:42] <Indigo_Automaton> WARP TRAVEL
[2:20:43] <derap41> that wouldn't be very believable either
[2:20:43] <$lumporr> oh man it's about to get HARD TO THINK ABOUT
[2:20:45] <dukenux> wormholes?
[2:20:45] <Hydrapissed> wtf warp speed
[2:20:47] <%krispen_wa> FORCE DIMENSIONS
[2:20:48] <gunsrlove> Wait, Measurehead also mentioned the Pale
[2:20:48] <Ids560> the teenager at the Frittte knew about this
[2:20:49] <%HeroToxiko> HMMMMMMM
[2:20:58] <%hax_metatron> WARP DIMENSIONS
[2:21:00] <sushahana> no
[2:21:01] <aewheros> The Pale is not vacuum. It's another kind of of non-matter.
[2:21:01] <Asuterisuku> If you can store music on a compact disc, why can't you store a person on one?
[2:21:02] <SpartanAltego> Kim probably doesn't want to hear about it because it's existentially terrifying.
[2:21:02] <Inqy833> Radiowaves force time and distance upon the Pale.
[2:21:03] <SomeAsianDood> hmmmmm
[2:21:03] <$lumporr> no
[2:21:04] <DatAsuna> no
[2:21:05] <begemp> no
[2:21:05] <dbag202> WARP?
[2:21:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no
[2:21:06] <derap41> hmmm nah
[2:21:07] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[2:21:07] <ToxInjection> Kinda reminds me of the Mass Effect in Mass Effect
[2:21:08] <+RoByte2> Make sure you don't lose those Gellar fields
[2:21:15] <CatRidder> no
[2:21:15] <lol_red_ranger> Chronoptic energy bursts from one plane to the other, evaporating anything it touches.
[2:21:16] <DSD24> I saw Interstellar though it did something similar
[2:21:19] <EternalJedi> shortedt way from point A to B is folding the map
[2:21:20] <pi_in_the_sci> Projecting meaning onto the pale make it more real
[2:21:21] <DatAsuna> That's just wormhole explanations

[2:21:32] <%kyh9> OH YEAH
[2:21:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you're applying radio waves to the pale to make it smaller to travel
[2:21:33] <$lumporr> YEAHYEAHYEAGH
[2:21:35] <DatAsuna> this is more like squeezing the paper like an accordian

[2:23:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:23:41] <Hydrapissed> her BRAIN huge
[2:23:44] <aiutare47> trained
[2:23:44] <%krispen_wa> SHE'S LITERALLY INSANE
[2:23:46] <thebalticguy1> ALMOST A MONTH
[2:23:49] <$hattrick61> A wrinkle in time, thats what it was
[2:23:52] <aiutare47> you can train for it
[2:23:52] <%wolfofsound> @krispen_wa well
[2:23:53] <SomeAsianDood> she's going INSANE
[2:23:55] <$lumporr> joyce is the coolest
[2:23:56] <%nicversus> "Hey lady, my name is Harry... I think"
[2:24:00] <derap41> Greeks
[2:24:02] <%JustToWatch> The area between the pale and the real world is called a porch collapse, and porches are usually in the back of the house, looking onto THE BACKYARD
[2:24:05] <DSD24> Woolie is going Beyond the Pale right now
[2:24:10] <mr_sups> @hattrick61 Oh my god!
[2:24:17] <%Sunriser41> this earth is not flat, because flat is a meaniless concept in the pale
[2:24:21] <Hydrapissed> I mean arnt we all
[2:24:22] <+projectmanatees> shes better than us
[2:24:22] <lyzejag> She is but also maybe, not
[2:24:22] <+Jiggisnipe> or is she the most reliable?
[2:24:22] <heemwizard> yep
[2:24:23] <$lumporr> i mean
[2:24:25] <%HeroToxiko> OOOP
[2:24:26] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus pale blue ocean?
[2:24:26] <DSD24> She's trained for it though
[2:24:29] <iacus_> Logic: FAIL
[2:24:29] <derap41> but if she is overexposed that means its real
[2:24:30] <Ids560> well she's not reliable because she's rich
[2:24:32] <Asuterisuku> Possibly with extensive brain damage
[2:24:34] <begemp> Or she has MAX insight
[2:24:35] <Robot_Nixon_> shes only slightly insane Kappa
[2:24:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> maybe she WANTS you to think she's overexposed
[2:24:36] <%kyh9> She's trained to handle it
[2:24:38] <%X2Eliah> oh jesus fuck woolie is gonna internalize this as flat earther bullshit and misread everything now
[2:24:41] <Lelfro> "you have first experience? not reliable"
[2:24:41] <%kyh9> She has 200 Volition
[2:24:41] <miucsa51> FRENZY
[2:24:41] <+MrAtheGreat> She is both the most anbd leastg reliable person you know for info
[2:24:46] <$lumporr> @X2Eliah don't tempt fate
[2:24:47] <ToxInjection> Harry's not really one to lecture others on insanity.
[2:24:47] <thebalticguy1> Shes Pale exposed for a near month, yet shes the most sane person you've met yet
[2:24:47] <DatAsuna> She's not reliable because she's an ultraliberal boat owner, not cause of the pale
[2:24:52] <%krispen_wa> ever wonder why the ultraliberal would be so supportive of the revolution?
[2:24:52] <%kyh9> like infinite volition
[2:24:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but yeah her insight stat is very high
[2:25:06] <Johannen> Woolie refuses to accept the Flat Earth Truth)
[2:25:08] <lyzejag> She's rich, and ultra, and the pale is the only thing that makes her not good ? She's been dubious since the beggining
[2:25:11] <%alpharius88> Sound something you should need a "gallagher field" form warhammer
[2:25:12] <%HeroToxiko> Is that what we call an unreliable narrator?
[2:25:18] <dukenux> She's insane because of the Pale, and that invalidates the Pale??
[2:25:29] <elshadow7> 6000 years of no progress
[2:25:32] <gunsrlove> @alpharius88  Geller field*
[2:25:34] <%wolfofsound> I love that chat has insight on her that's different than others based on choices, this game is nuts
[2:25:36] <skunk1324> Shes a representative of a company that makes billions
[2:25:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> she also said living in the same time is more relatable than your economic or social status, so there's that
[2:25:41] <andre11dr> So what we learned here is that Woolie could be turned into a flat earther more easily than you thought Kappa
[2:25:42] <+MrAtheGreat> Ew is Woolie one of those crazy ROUND earthers?
[2:25:44] <$lumporr> @dukenux ah yes. perfect sense sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[2:25:45] <%Sunriser41> the "far pale"
[2:25:50] <+Kataguro> Flying just makes it a lot faster
[2:25:50] <Inqy833> An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by another force.
[2:25:52] <%X2Eliah> yes
[2:25:55] <%X2Eliah> inertia
[2:25:55] <%kyh9> You have to stay on the 'shallow' end of the pale
[2:25:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @dukenux lol yea Woolie's logic kinda falls apart
[2:25:58] <derap41> Hyperbolic Geometry Earth

[2:28:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:28:13] <%krispen_wa> The world is getting ratio'd on twitter
[2:28:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> How is it an unknown rate if it's a measurable effect
[2:28:17] <Johannen> Unknown rate is the scary part
[2:28:21] <dukenux> yeah like the universe
[2:28:21] <%wolfofsound> I'd drink myself into sleep every day too

[2:28:41] <%hax_metatron> GLOBAL WARMING
[2:28:42] <heemwizard> climate change doesnt compare
[2:28:43] <%krispen_wa> @reallybigrocks if the rate changes by the second then the rate is immeasurable
[2:28:43] <Darren716> boo
[2:28:44] <Hydrapissed> global warming
[2:28:46] <DSD24> @DeepSearch27 Remember that Harry here just had a really bad medical episode
[2:28:47] <Johannen> @ReallyBigRocks It is happening and you can probe it but the speed of it is not consistnent
[2:28:49] <%kyh9> DONT LET IT SET IN
[2:28:49] <%X2Eliah> Aand there is why Kim stepped away

[2:29:02] <%wolfofsound> at least with global warming the planet will recover
[2:29:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> this is if global warming sent to Venus levels bad
[2:29:04] <+babyacid> kim knows but its a bummer to talk about
[2:29:05] <%kyh9> Do not let it set in

[2:29:36] <%kyh9> It was Apocalypse cop
[2:29:37] <aewheros> The Universe? Have we observed Pale in outer space?
[2:29:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah it's fine
[2:29:39] <%DiscoMatador> Its fine

[2:31:08] <%superc37> @aiutare47 but there are stars right? constellations? and a sun? how tf can there be no outer space if all that exists
[2:31:10] <+OblivionSword1> it's DISCO
[2:31:11] <%wolfofsound> 6 LUL
[2:31:12] <EternalJedi> considering how long they've been studying the Pale, apparently this IS elementary school stuff
[2:31:13] <%HeroToxiko> I mean, Harry was a cop so he wouldn't be interested in stuff like this LUL
[2:31:13] <SomeAsianDood> 6666
[2:31:13] <+MrAtheGreat> 9 CHOICES
[2:31:13] <lyzejag> 555555555
[2:31:14] <TrueSatanos> Joyce is insane and I love her
[2:31:15] <DSD24> I picked 4
[2:31:16] <heemwizard> 7
[2:31:18] <dbag202> 6
[2:31:19] <Darren716> Disco fever
[2:31:19] <+Mendin> Hey Woolie do you remember talking to an old lady lorry driver down in the bottom right corner?
[2:31:22] <andre11dr> Woolie definitely trusting her more than me
[2:31:28] <heemwizard> 8
[2:31:29] <Robot_Nixon_> 5 KKomrade
[2:31:29] <ToxInjection> Fight the apocalypse with COMMUNISM.
[2:31:30] <+MrAtheGreat> COMMUNISM WILLS SAVE US LUL
[2:31:33] <%krispen_wa> 4 is...very optimistic
[2:31:33] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:31:34] <ingman112> @mendin he‚Äôll get there, he‚Äôs got the Joyce quest
[2:31:35] <+Prevot> 5 and 6 LUL
[2:31:39] <derap41> Entropy doesn't care about Ideology
[2:31:39] <TrueSatanos> It's Disco, baby
[2:31:43] <munitalprats> DISCO
[2:31:44] <Darren716> 2222
[2:31:44] <aewheros> @aewheros It's true they haven't reached upper orbit. But I think this world is supposed to be a planet. Just fractured by "the pale".
[2:31:45] <dukenux> the options 5 to 7 are a joke
[2:31:46] <Inqy833> The heat death fo the universe is most un-liberal.
[2:31:46] <%hax_metatron> I KNEW WOOLIE WOULD PICK 8
[2:31:52] <%alpharius88> Iam in day 3 and i didnt  get all of this!!! THIS GAME RULES
[2:31:54] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> It is absolutely disco
[2:31:56] <+metzselaar> 4 is mine
[2:32:01] <lyzejag> I think i would just vomit
[2:32:06] <+Jeshk0> Its discco
[2:32:06] <aiutare47> @superc37 How can there be matter at all? how is there gravity? I have no clue, but the talk of the balloons makes me thing these are spheres of reality floating in the Pale
[2:32:06] <%xcompleasedad> The fact that 5 KINDA works, based on the Spirit Quest, is NUTS to me
[2:32:07] <Zomner> would collapse
[2:32:09] <$lumporr> i'd want to see it
[2:32:09] <sporeian94> Literally Climate Change
[2:32:11] <DSD24> I picked 4 cause I'd like to be optimistic
[2:32:14] <%wolfofsound> I'd go find those drugs
[2:32:14] <+Bitscreed> I went with 4 myself
[2:32:15] <$hattrick61> of to drink
[2:32:15] <Eger007> it's kinda enthropy death
[2:32:16] <mr_sups> -2 Morale
[2:32:16] <Hydrapissed> 2
[2:32:17] <%Sunriser41> i would just take a boat and go into the pale, fuck it
[2:32:20] <dukenux> I mean this is all a question of WHEN it will happen
[2:32:22] <+Prevot> LUL
[2:32:22] <Johannen> It is Disco baby
[2:32:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:32:23] <Fuji808> 2, 4, 8. We need an Option 10 where we vomit in terror.
[2:32:23] <LiloAndStitchIceCreamGuy> LUL
[2:32:24] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[2:32:25] <laserbeaming> LUL

[2:32:29] <+Kataguro> Politics is everything, Woolie.  Clearly.
[2:32:31] <dukenux> LUL
[2:32:31] <derap41> LUL
[2:32:31] <Enajy314> pogonaLUL
[2:32:32] <andre11dr> I picked 2 because the game is called Disco
[2:32:32] <lyzejag> ???
[2:32:32] <$lumporr> YEP
[2:32:32] <Darren716> LUL
[2:32:32] <dukenux> yep
[2:32:34] <+Jiggisnipe> that's why you answer 2 baby
[2:32:35] <Hydrapissed> she sounds crazy lol
[2:32:35] <iacus_> why
[2:32:39] <OverlordedK> What game does he think he's playing LUL
[2:32:42] <Lelfro> what if it's a satire answer to cope?
[2:32:47] <Inqy833> The personal is political.
[2:32:50] <Lancaster_H> woolie stop making this game political LUL
[2:32:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @neostria

[2:32:53] <munitalprats> woolie what game are you playing
[2:32:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no my brainworms
[2:32:56] <aiutare47> 9 feels like the actual answer, its so mind meltingly huge
[2:32:57] <%dalmek> the brain spiders have taken full control
[2:32:58] <+SouLucha> Fair.
[2:32:58] <miucsa51> Entropy wins
[2:32:59] <lyzejag> No politics is obviously no politcs it's so easy
[2:33:01] <bonebagMEL> Oh, I just got it. Pale is global warming...
[2:33:01] <+Jeshk0> only communism can save us from the Pale!
[2:33:02] <linSP> ‚Äúthe pale? It was the damn liberals!‚Äù
[2:33:02] <derap41> entropy doesn't care about politics
[2:33:04] <ingman112> Politics is the biggest of all coping mechanisms
[2:33:04] <CatRidder> centrist
[2:33:04] <TrueSatanos> But the pale literally is political. The entire game is politics.
[2:33:05] <Parapattern> It's Disco BABEY
[2:33:09] <iacus_> unilaterally cutting a person out of your life for that?
[2:33:11] <$hattrick61> "Hey man this apocalypse thing is gonna be bad for the polls."
[2:33:13] <%X2Eliah> 1, 3, 9 are valid
[2:33:14] <%krispen_wa> GLOBAL WARMING

[2:33:23] <+Jiggisnipe> imagine someone learning about about the heat death of the universe and being like politics tho
[2:33:27] <hungryhannya> communism must save us from the pale
[2:33:31] <%Lion_kun> CASTLESUPERBEAST FINAL

[2:35:41] <%kyh9> LMAO
[2:35:43] <%HeroToxiko> He thinks harry is a child
[2:35:43] <DSD24> 2 is honest
[2:35:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> good, you didn't pass out at the CONCEPT
[2:35:45] <derap41> Kim looking out for you all the time
[2:35:46] <Ids560> no Raphael this time, they passed that check
[2:35:47] <SomeAsianDood> not wrong though
[2:35:47] <%kyh9> I mean you JUST passed out
[2:35:49] <mr_sups> WOuld you?
[2:35:49] <twoto858> Kim was worried about you BibleThump
[2:35:50] <Kyuseishun> 2
[2:35:51] <skunk1324> @SomeAsianDood sorry lol
[2:35:54] <gecomaman> 2222
[2:35:56] <dbag202> Kim was worried about you
[2:35:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Very real possibility given your reaction to other things lol
[2:35:57] <+MrAtheGreat> and hey, why did the old you get so screwed up in the first place?
[2:36:00] <%wolfofsound> It's REAL WOOLIE
[2:36:01] <Johannen> HIT me Up, More Reality Drug
[2:36:07] <derap41> This is basic Spacetime
[2:36:08] <%Sunriser41> so its all true woolie
[2:36:09] <Inqy833> Well yeah I mean Kim did just have to resuscitate you after a panic attack.
[2:36:09] <%SirGO0SE> confirmation of it being real
[2:36:09] <+RoByte2> You fainted reading a letter you tossed in the garbage, do you blame him?
[2:36:10] <lyzejag> Now you *know*
[2:36:11] <+Jeshk0> "yo kim, youve heard of the Pale?? shits wild!"
[2:36:15] <%nicversus> I may not be completely on her side politically, but she is really cool. Cool enough to set aside any political gripes.
[2:36:16] <DSD24> @MrAtheGreat I think it was the Alcoholism
[2:36:22] <Kyuseishun> 2
[2:36:25] <yomamma133713> not done
[2:36:25] <TrueSatanos> The Pale changes literally everything you think about the game. It's amazing.
[2:36:30] <stormhawk9891> You can come back later
[2:36:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> APOCALYPSE
[2:36:37] <shakespearo> @Jeshk0 like telling your coworker "YO did you know there is space??"
[2:36:37] <$hattrick61> You DID pass out from your paperwork, it was a reasonable concern
[2:36:37] <+ALazo> right on cue
[2:36:39] <munitalprats> COPOCALYPSE
[2:36:40] <gecomaman> What a game. Holy shit
[2:36:40] <+Prevot> perfect timing
[2:36:40] <%X2Eliah> TIMING
[2:36:40] <+OblivionSword1> GREAT TIMING
[2:36:41] <%Frostilk> fitting
[2:36:42] <%krispen_wa> TOPICAL
[2:36:42] <+Mendin> Joyce is astoundingly nice and friendly for a ruthless arch-capitalist
[2:36:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> she's a really well written character, but who isn't in this game?
[2:36:43] <hungryhannya> perfect timing
[2:36:46] <skunk1324> those buffs tough
[2:36:46] <Darren716> YEssss
[2:36:46] <%SirGO0SE> @nicversus i want her to bake me cookies and give me grandma kissies
[2:36:47] <+Hayajin_> acopalypse
[2:36:50] <Zomner> monkaS
[2:36:54] <dbag202> kekw
[2:36:54] <DSD24> Oh god this is just Woolie
[2:36:56] <%SainEdge> monkaS
[2:36:56] <+MrAtheGreat> not great nl
[2:36:58] <iacus_> oh that's a cool effect. my 2 favorite skills
[2:36:58] <+Bitscreed> Do not think about The Event.
[2:37:03] <Lelfro> there's a hidden bonus to this one, not written
[2:37:05] <DSD24> Look at those learning caps
[2:37:09] <%krispen_wa> @mendin capital wears a nice face, but takes it off only when it commits atrocity
[2:37:12] <TrueSatanos> Apocalypse Cops literally makes complete sense once you know about The Pale.
[2:37:12] <andre11dr> Good timing on this
[2:37:13] <%nicversus> @SirGO0SE lmao that would be nice
[2:37:14] <Darren716> It's not the end of the world, but you can see it from here
[2:37:16] <%Koopardon> 6/5 for this playthough ngl
[2:37:17] <dukenux> Doompilled
[2:37:17] <heemwizard> Its coming in 28 years....
[2:37:17] <iambqb> The timing on this

[2:37:20] <%hax_metatron> OUTER WILDS
[2:37:21] <Asuterisuku> Hobocop of the Apocalypse
[2:37:23] <aiutare47> @Mendin remember, shes a professional negotiator, making people like her is her job
[2:37:29] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[2:37:29] <derap41> That did  almost nothing for you
[2:37:29] <he1lhydra> "rolled back"? sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[2:37:31] <%X2Eliah> the pale
[2:37:31] <CatRidder> fighting game with roll back
[2:37:32] <dds333a> GRIPPED with anxiety over the end of the world
[2:37:33] <nivlac_555> lmfao
[2:37:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> HOBO APOCALYPSE COP
[2:37:35] <%X2Eliah> actually just the pale
[2:37:35] <Hydrapissed> here we go DISCO baby wooooooo
[2:37:35] <%jepupu> Doomsaying Dwarf
[2:37:36] <dukenux> THE END IS NIGH
[2:37:37] <@Solidus_113> shivers cap raised
[2:37:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:37:40] <Indigo_Automaton> INSIGHT GAINED
[2:37:43] <Lancaster_H> GGPO COP
[2:37:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:46] <+Jeshk0> Better get your End is Nigh sign
[2:37:50] <shakespearo> Check the bookstore for more info on The Pale
[2:37:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> fog of war is GROWING
[2:37:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I think his shivers cap was already 6 tho
[2:37:54] <+Bitscreed> Oooh Shivers AND Inland Empire raised? Perfect
[2:37:55] <%X2Eliah> Woolie has understood it completely and Reggie is just blocking it out xDS
[2:37:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> SWELLING
[2:37:56] <derap41> that was pretty useless
[2:37:58] <ingman112> So you can now dump hobocop if need be, b/c your shivers cap is up to 6
[2:38:02] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus sounds like dementia
[2:38:06] <UvBenServed> The fog of war is an environmental hazard
[2:38:06] <bonebagMEL> The world is Styrofoam floating in a sea of gasoline
[2:38:08] <Blank9> your stat caps were already pretty high
[2:38:10] <aewheros> look at all those diamonds
[2:38:10] <laserbeaming> it's a cool thought for a first playthrough
[2:38:13] <Inqy833> @krispen_wa I think Joyce is a bit more than that. She's not putting on an act, and that's what makes her so fascinating and charming. It's just that what she says it totally insane and treats people as abstracts.
[2:38:14] <%PMAvers> Well, our learning cap for Shivers was like 7, so not a whole lot.
[2:38:14] <munitalprats> now you can dump hobocop
[2:38:16] <andre11dr> The 2 most interesting stats
[2:38:17] <FassieFons> 4 points already
[2:38:19] <%nicversus> the human mind gets to experience what happens to the computer's memory every time you delete a file when it travels through the pale
[2:38:23] <Robot_Nixon_> @ingman112 thats heathen talk üò° hobo for life
[2:38:25] <UvBenServed> LUL
[2:38:29] <mr_sups> Holy shit I forgot y'all are on day 1
[2:38:31] <munitalprats> thoughts
[2:38:34] <LlewynMarie> kids learning about the Pale in this world is like kids learning about Climate Change
[2:38:34] <munitalprats> thought slot
[2:38:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> DAY 1
[2:38:39] <ingman112> @tuna_can_0 I WANT A HOUSE BRO
[2:38:39] <+OblivionSword1> more shiverrs let's go
[2:38:46] <Robot_Nixon_> @ingman112 LUL
[2:38:47] <lyzejag> COMMIE TIME
[2:38:47] <munitalprats> HUSTLE
[2:38:49] <iambqb> I mean in this universe, the crazy rambling hobo would be talking about how the world is going to be saved
[2:38:51] <yomamma133713> thoughts are always nice
[2:38:52] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, this is still day 1 btw LUL
[2:38:53] <munitalprats> TAX EVASION
[2:38:53] <CatRidder> do commie thought
[2:38:55] <%bread_assassin> H U S T L E
[2:39:01] <+procrastiamus> get that commie shit in there baby
[2:39:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> maybe wait for more thoughts
[2:39:06] <%krispen_wa> @nicversus more like being forced to look at all the internet articles of the past all at once
[2:39:12] <LegitBarnacleBoy> You no longer have the problem debuffs, those are temporary
[2:39:14] <+MrAtheGreat> You only get half the benefit of Apocoalypse Cop because of Hobhocop
[2:39:14] <Project205> White Mourning has a really cool solution
[2:39:15] <%X2Eliah> Problem debuff goes away
[2:39:16] <Lancaster_H> woolie the problem is temporary
[2:39:19] <heemwizard> you can forget that thought if u want
[2:39:19] <aiutare47> those are temporary
[2:39:20] <Indigo_Automaton> Debuffs are temporary
[2:39:23] <LegitBarnacleBoy> problem debuffs are already gone
[2:39:24] <dds333a> @krispen_wa absolute insanity in that
[2:39:27] <%X2Eliah> @Problem debuff is gone when completed
[2:39:28] <+Kataguro> The Problem is only while you're internalizing it
[2:39:28] <munitalprats> debuffs are temporary
[2:39:36] <andre11dr> Woolie my man ,you need some HUSTLE IN THIS BITCH
[2:39:38] <munitalprats> get rid of hobocop
[2:39:42] <munitalprats> BECOME HUSTLER
[2:39:42] <derap41> Hobo and Cop of the Apocalypse are neutralizing each other
[2:39:42] <+OblivionSword1> debuff are gone when you get the solution
[2:39:42] <+MrAtheGreat> nope. it's always a crap shoot
[2:39:47] <LegitBarnacleBoy> debuffs are gone
[2:39:57] <iacus_> Selfish request: Do White Mourning
[2:39:58] <%Arnoldoaad1> some solutions do have downsides
[2:40:03] <$hattrick61> White mourning is great storywise
[2:40:04] <Johannen> Just choose what sounds fun
[2:40:10] <Inqy833> White Mourning is awesome.
[2:40:15] <Zomner> I mean, they are perks
[2:40:18] <ingman112> Best way is to lean into thoughts that seem to complement your playstyle, and hope for the best
[2:40:18] <munitalprats> get rid of hobo
[2:40:18] <+MrAtheGreat> generally the cop ooption are the best ones, particularly Art Cop
[2:40:18] <primaryfire> I didn't much care for potentially throwing away a dozen points so I looked up the finished bonuses
[2:40:24] <yomamma133713> white mourning sounds important
[2:40:25] <Onamar> Apocalypse Cop + full Half-Light is really fun
[2:40:29] <Inqy833> Communism... won't make you a happy person.
[2:40:30] <%chandlerofearth> hobo gives them more money though
[2:40:31] <%JustToWatch> there's no reason to forget a thought until you have unlocked and filled out all of the thought slots
[2:40:32] <iacus_> get rid of shit compressor imo
[2:40:33] <heemwizard> no get rid of shit compressor
[2:40:36] <derap41> Communism is pretty boring
[2:40:37] <+IvesNapalm> Generally, unless you don't like something you opted into or you've used all thought slots, you don't want to remove a thought
[2:40:37] <TrueSatanos> Some solutions can be bad, but you've gotta take that mystery shot first to know.
[2:40:49] <munitalprats> BECOME HUSTLER
[2:40:51] <%krispen_wa> HUSTLE AND GRIND
[2:40:57] <dds333a> I just rolled with what I thought suited the investigation best my first playthrough LUL
[2:40:59] <heemwizard> you get a lot of money
[2:41:02] <derap41> cash money?
[2:41:03] <+MrAtheGreat> Don't get rid of shit always buy new cabinets first
[2:41:04] <%hax_metatron> $$$$$$
[2:41:06] <CatRidder> hustle and flow
[2:41:07] <Lelfro> dosh
[2:41:08] <Zomner> loads emone
[2:41:09] <LunarRemix> It leads to fucking money
[2:41:09] <primaryfire> shit compressor has no function anymore
[2:41:10] <%bread_assassin> F R E E  M O N E Y
[2:41:12] <heemwizard> money for ....
[2:41:14] <munitalprats> IT LEADS TO MONEY
[2:41:16] <munitalprats> BIG HUSTLER
[2:41:19] <%X2Eliah> spoilers
[2:41:19] <%krispen_wa> HUSTLE
[2:41:21] <+MrAtheGreat> That ones good
[2:41:22] <Asuterisuku> It's what you get to be not broke
[2:41:23] <TrueSatanos> 15th Indotribe is a pretty cool one.
[2:41:27] <dds333a> Needless to say, I rolled only with the boring thoughts
[2:41:28] <+babyacid> 15th endotribe is great if taken EARLY
[2:41:29] <%X2Eliah> INDOTRIBE IS GOOD
[2:41:30] <iacus_> fifteenth indotribe has a great lore payoff
[2:41:33] <%hax_metatron> It's about companies
[2:41:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhhhh interesting
[2:41:39] <shakespearo> @Asuterisuku Nah that's Wompty Dompty
[2:41:41] <lyzejag> Almost 6H ?? Holy shit
[2:41:42] <%krispen_wa> 15th indotribe is good for gamifying the system
[2:41:44] <ingman112> You can always save the point too
[2:41:59] <laserbeaming> The Sadness Thought
[2:41:59] <derap41> White Mourning is realizing what happened
[2:42:06] <%kyh9> It's about corporations, not nations
[2:42:07] <Deasmeister> Existentialism
[2:42:08] <Blank9> I just maxed how many thoughts I could have, because they're as good as a level
[2:42:08] <+Kataguro> I think you can try the notebook again
[2:42:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I like white mourning a lot Woolz, not gonna say why:)
[2:42:09] <depressioncherrie> important point: the political vision quest that was added in "The Final Cut" only triggers if you have one of the 4 political thoughts internalized. So you want at least one of them, possibly more to keep your options open...
[2:42:14] <munitalprats> get rid of hobocop
[2:42:16] <Inqy833> Advanced Race Theory... you know you want to.
[2:42:16] <%Javaa01> Both are very good
[2:42:16] <Lelfro> are you gonna dig back your bad past? at what cost
[2:42:16] <munitalprats> or shit compressors
[2:42:20] <iacus_> good picks
[2:42:23] <+MrAtheGreat> Cop thoughts are great, but Political thoughts are incredibly weak unless you commit to that Political alignment.
[2:42:23] <munitalprats> and just take both
[2:42:24] <heemwizard> @depressioncherrie this
[2:42:25] <derap41> Both are good
[2:42:28] <nakunattakage> removing a thought takes a skillpoint chat
[2:42:31] <Lancaster_H> white mourning is real good lore @WoolieVersus
[2:42:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> Shit compressor looks pretty useless
[2:42:33] <+babyacid> 15 indo FIRST then
[2:42:36] <primaryfire> theres a "where you come from" thought that acts as the opposite of hobocop but they're mutually exclusive
[2:42:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Getting rid of a thought costs points, he'd rather get a new one right now
[2:42:40] <%Mathochism> Getting rid of shit means spending a point. He should just open up thoughts.
[2:42:45] <CatRidder> it a good one
[2:42:46] <iacus_> now there's literally no difference between unlocking and forgetting. no point in getting rid of anything
[2:42:46] <Asuterisuku> The Indotribe has no penalty and just takes time.
[2:42:53] <%X2Eliah> yeah for now its better to keep unlocking slots
[2:42:53] <+MrAtheGreat> NO
[2:42:53] <derap41> HoboCop and Cop of the Apocalypse are kinda doing the same thing
[2:42:55] <munitalprats> apparently dont pull one out
[2:42:58] <+OblivionSword1> not now
[2:42:59] <%JustToWatch> it cost a point to forget a thought
[2:42:59] <%X2Eliah> PULLING OUT COSTS
[2:42:59] <munitalprats> and just get a new one, is what people are saying
[2:43:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not until you're full
[2:43:01] <+Mendin> ta oŒªŒ±
[2:43:02] <nakunattakage> taking them out costs a skillpoint woolie
[2:43:03] <lyzejag> @depressioncherrie Oh really ? The, you can unlock the 4 quest at the same time ?
[2:43:03] <laserbeaming> forgetting costs points
[2:43:03] <+rusefus> better to just unlock more slots
[2:43:03] <oda_flobunaga> Can't now
[2:43:04] <+Kataguro> It takes a point to forget a thought.  You might as well just open up more slots instead
[2:43:08] <%Frostilk> Can't it cost points
[2:43:08] <%justcallmebobplease> Just unlock a new slot, don't waste points removing something
[2:43:08] <$hattrick61> pulling out costs pointa
[2:43:09] <thebalticguy1> Pulling out a thought costs a Point
[2:43:11] <pi_in_the_sci> dorgetrting and geaining a new slot cost the same
[2:43:12] <Indigo_Automaton> Never forget, just unlock a new slot
[2:43:12] <TrueSatanos> It costs the same to buy a new slot as it does to lose an old one, best to max out the cabinet.
[2:43:13] <CatRidder> you cant i take a point to forget
[2:43:15] <Inqy833> No real point taking stuff out till you've maxed out your cabinet.
[2:43:15] <+OblivionSword1> removing a thought is for later when you have no slots left
[2:43:16] <Blank9> only start forgetting when you can't keep any more thoughts
[2:43:18] <ingman112> That costs a point. Just go for the new slots
[2:43:18] <+babyacid> costs the same
[2:43:20] <derap41> Hobo is kinda useless if you don't use it
[2:43:22] <Deasmeister> costs point to forget
[2:43:25] <%justcallmebobplease> New slot is same cost as removing a thought, just open a new slot
[2:43:29] <%X2Eliah> KEEP JAMAIS VU ALWAYS
[2:43:29] <Lancaster_H> pulling out has no upside until you're full on slots, costs the same to open up a new one @WoolieVersus
[2:43:29] <%Javaa01> Can't be a pullout king without points
[2:43:31] <andre11dr> Does sleeping count towards the time for the thoughts?
[2:43:32] <%X2Eliah> EXP BIG
[2:43:32] <ingman112> You don‚Äôt need hobo and apocalypse both
[2:43:33] <aiutare47> Absolutely no reason to get rid of a thought before you hit the maximum thought cap
[2:43:35] <derap41> yes
[2:43:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just open new slots, if you run out then forget
[2:43:37] <%justcallmebobplease> YES
[2:43:39] <aiutare47> Yes
[2:43:39] <%X2Eliah> YES
[2:43:40] <Indigo_Automaton> YES
[2:43:41] <+rusefus> 100%
[2:43:42] <%DiscoMatador> ye
[2:43:42] <Johannen> Yes
[2:43:43] <Robot_Nixon_> What will you do with all your uncompressed shit though??
[2:43:46] <+babyacid> YES
[2:43:46] <andre11dr> Yep
[2:43:47] <derap41> UNless you get a terrible thought
[2:43:47] <%illtima> don't forget until all slots are full, yeah
[2:43:52] <thebalticguy1> yes, until you max out
[2:43:56] <oda_flobunaga> c'est vrais
[2:44:07] <iacus_> now go to bed ffs
[2:44:08] <+rusefus> pls sleep
[2:44:10] <%Frostilk> Unlock, max out, then forget and replace
[2:44:11] <oda_flobunaga> nein
[2:44:11] <lambishly> you CAN remove but it also takes a level pip
[2:44:14] <Johannen> BUG
[2:44:16] <%Javaa01> It's too late to talk to her
[2:44:20] <derap41> No sleep we've got mysteries to solve
[2:44:21] <%DiscoMatador> Bug
[2:44:23] <neostria> Kim needs sleep :(
[2:44:24] <yomamma133713> bug
[2:44:28] <gecomaman> Can you do anything with the body? If not then probably bedtime.
[2:44:30] <TrueSatanos> Joyce is someone you should check in with occasionally
[2:44:31] <heemwizard> @Javaa01 no you can still talk
[2:44:31] <+Mr_Pylon> Do the end of day debrief with Kim
[2:44:34] <+OblivionSword1> there is one esprit de corp white check
[2:44:35] <ingman112> Bedtime
[2:44:36] <Indigo_Automaton> Debrief and Sleep would be best
[2:44:37] <%X2Eliah> She is mostly done
[2:44:38] <heemwizard> just a bit bugged
[2:44:39] <Blank9> kim can talk to you at the inn
[2:44:41] <%X2Eliah> He can check tomorrow
[2:44:44] <+procrastiamus> its a quarter past midniiiight
[2:44:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1392160075305865219
[2:44:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Always buy cabinets, only burn thoughts when they are useless/detrimental to you. Those points that get rid of thoughts are usually better spent on skills
[2:44:57] <CatRidder> no he doesnt
[2:44:57] <+Kataguro> Hella dark
[2:45:01] <%hax_metatron> CUNO DOESNT SLEEP
[2:45:01] <%wolfofsound> been running around all day and he's been very patient
[2:45:03] <iacus_> jaysus
[2:45:06] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL

[2:53:35] <derap41> Cesh monies
[2:53:44] <%X2Eliah> ATHOUSAND MONIES
[2:53:57] <SomeAsianDood> @primaryfire he points out ur shoe on the balcony if u don't pick it up. That's what happened in my first olaythrough
[2:53:58] <%wolfofsound> WINK WINK
[2:54:06] <iacus_> the prescribed amount of FINES
[2:54:08] <%X2Eliah> @SomeAsianDood oh thats great
[2:54:16] <dbag202> We don't take bribed kekw
[2:54:24] <Johannen> I feel like clothes were a late addition to the game, and there is a canon costume that you upgrade thruout  the game
[2:54:36] <Hydrapissed> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:54:37] <+Kataguro> I like this system
[2:54:39] <Hydrapissed> thats a neat one
[2:54:40] <derap41> Sounds Fimiliar
[2:54:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's how it works IRL
[2:54:43] <%Deft_Thought> Man, I wish I had known that the devs partnered with a fashion company and were selling a version of Kim's jacket. Sold out crazy quick.
[2:54:45] <QuicksilverMachine> he means "do you want to pay 1000 fine or to give me 800"
[2:54:49] <%kyh9> Similar to real life
[2:54:52] <oda_flobunaga> very japanese
[2:54:53] <dukenux> that usually how it SHOULD work
[2:54:55] <derap41> This is how it works
[2:54:56] <%nicversus> that's what court dates are
[2:54:58] <%HeroToxiko> It's almost like cash bail is a scam
[2:54:58] <%kyh9> And then you CANT plead the fifth
[2:54:59] <Hydrapissed> how it should work lol
[2:55:01] <Asuterisuku> "Show up or lose the right to vote."
[2:55:03] <ToxInjection> Like court dates, but for everything.
[2:55:03] <munitalprats> that's what court dates
[2:55:03] <linSP> come to jail please
[2:55:03] <Inqy833> Yeah, there's plenty of countries that basically do that.
[2:55:04] <Lelfro> sorry, I overslept, guess I'm a fugitive
[2:55:04] <yomamma133713> court dates
[2:55:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> *Cough* social credit score *cough*
[2:55:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> Basically skipping the bail process
[2:55:06] <dukenux> it's default how it works here
[2:55:09] <%Arnoldoaad1> Thts not uncommon
[2:55:11] <mr_sups> Court date
[2:55:14] <%HeroToxiko> Not here we don't LUL
[2:55:15] <dds333a> It's up to you
[2:55:16] <Johannen> That is prety common
[2:55:17] <kikoeru_san> probably woulda stopped Freddy Gray from happening
[2:55:18] <derap41> the US loves that because it lets you pile on more shit
[2:55:20] <%X2Eliah> This is more extreme case than irl
[2:55:21] <%kyh9> lots of white collar crimes have that
[2:55:26] <Eger007> basically bailbonding in advance
[2:55:31] <dukenux> You get a court order, and if you don't show up, theyll bring you in in cuffs
[2:55:32] <CatRidder> rich people get that power
[2:55:38] <jorniev> yeah but this is to get arrested
[2:55:45] <derap41> pls don't shoot people
[2:55:46] <andre11dr> I think in certain countries arrests work like that
[2:55:47] <munitalprats> 'admonished'
[2:55:56] <+MrAtheGreat> we od that with immigrants. Those that apparently *have no reason to show up* according to old white fuck-ups
[2:56:08] <Mr_Zero5232> I guess like a court date, miss it if you want, but we comin for dat ass if ya do
[2:56:28] <derap41> @Mr_Zero5232 and we will take all your shit
[2:56:37] <%HeroToxiko> @kikoeru_san nah thats not how that works
[2:56:39] <+Kataguro> The RCM also isn't as big as a normal police department.  They don't have the manpower to do big arrests all the time
[2:56:58] <Hydrapissed> Hmmmmmmm
[2:57:04] <Hydrapissed> hmmmmmm
[2:57:10] <%wolfofsound> monkaS
[2:57:16] <dbag202> Set me free, she said
[2:57:18] <Mr_Zero5232> @derap41 well, nothing like a forfeit to hit home
[2:57:19] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[2:57:22] <Hydrapissed> hmmm
[2:57:22] <Asuterisuku> Which is how it SHOULD be.
[2:57:23] <Johannen> She told me to "FREE HER" you saw it
[2:57:26] <derap41> mmhmm
[2:57:29] <AngryAsian5> SET ME FREE
[2:57:34] <Inqy833> The RCM has many problems but, well, they would not be solved by defunding. It's interesting.
[2:57:35] <%nicversus> @Johannen LUL
[2:57:39] <ToxInjection> Damn, Internal Affairs doing their job? A bit unrealistic there
[2:57:40] <derap41> Guy Woolie Cowarded out
[2:57:48] <derap41> He did not set anyone free
[2:57:54] <Fuji808> "We investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong."

[2:58:18] <%X2Eliah> So it's not a fully "police" police
[2:58:19] <Asuterisuku> Kim disagrees.
[2:58:20] <%wolfofsound> @Fuji808 but to make you babies happy they don't have to come in to work for a few months but get paid the same
[2:58:21] <Hydrapissed> I am the law
[2:58:23] <%nicversus> but the people HATE the RCM
[2:58:29] <NeekoFM> the people's police

[3:01:49] <UvBenServed> "Pick one of these or fuck off"
[3:01:49] <+MrAtheGreat> yeah
[3:01:49] <derap41> big UN
[3:01:50] <%wolfofsound> ya
[3:01:50] <lyzejag> 4 is fucking disguting
[3:01:50] <iacus_> yep
[3:01:51] <%kyh9> Basically the SUPER UN
[3:01:51] <%Irridium> fuckin' 4 LUL
[3:01:52] <Zomner> Yup
[3:01:52] <%xcompleasedad> The RACIST UN
[3:01:52] <%X2Eliah> Yep
[3:01:53] <+OblivionSword1> yeas basically
[3:01:55] <heemwizard> @jorniev i wishm probably unlikely since hes moralist is 1 or 2
[3:01:57] <aiutare47> Absolutely
[3:01:57] <%hax_metatron> But from the perspective of a third world country that was destroyed Woolie
[3:01:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pretty much
[3:01:58] <%kyh9> UN but more guns
[3:01:59] <derap41> Evil UN
[3:02:01] <kikoeru_san> IF the UN had power
[3:02:01] <laserbeaming> and running it for 5 DECADES
[3:02:02] <TrueSatanos> Revachol was not on the way to a failed state
[3:02:03] <Blank9> stepping in to stop the communists
[3:02:06] <andre11dr> Wow ,fucking 4
[3:02:07] <Lancaster_H> yeah its UN but with power
[3:02:07] <%krispen_wa> Not UN. Moralintern actually DOES things
[3:02:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> Think Bosnia and Herzegovina
[3:02:09] <Ids560> if the UN could do things
[3:02:09] <%kyh9> UN with a REAL military body
[3:02:09] <oda_flobunaga> 1st World telling the third world how to live
[3:02:10] <%X2Eliah> yep
[3:02:11] <+theCatastrophy> The UN stepped in to stop the communists
[3:02:11] <yomamma133713> communism didnt fail first
[3:02:12] <Chatterbox1991> Post WW2 Germany
[3:02:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> racist super UN with a military
[3:02:15] <yomamma133713> they made them fail
[3:02:16] <TrueSatanos> It was stepping in to prevent an alternate type of rule
[3:02:16] <+Mendin> The communism failed because the UN -blew it the FUCK UP-
[3:02:16] <aewheros> Or rather the permanent security council members
[3:02:19] <Deasmeister> Germany after WW2 more like
[3:02:19] <%HeroToxiko> They stepped in to Make the state fail
[3:02:20] <lyzejag> 3333
[3:02:21] <+procrastiamus> UN decides the state has failed and then makes sure it fails
[3:02:26] <jorniev> AND THEN DOING LESS than nothing
[3:02:26] <+projectmanatees> commuism always fails
[3:02:26] <LunarRemix> Kind of, Communism didn't fail it didn't have the chance to fail
[3:02:27] <derap41> LUL
[3:02:28] <Kyuseishun> Communism didnt fail so thats why its stepped in
[3:02:31] <%wolfofsound> 3 is right tho
[3:02:31] <iacus_> 2 is the real, observable one
[3:02:32] <ingman112> The question is whether they caused the failure or cleaned up afterwards
[3:02:33] <TrueSatanos> They're more CIA than UN
[3:02:33] <Hydrapissed> LOL

[3:04:51] <Blank9> frogs are turning gay you know
[3:05:00] <derap41> Just Imagine  Kim giving that look
[3:05:01] <lambishly> Nationalism is just large scale fascism
[3:05:03] <Inqy833> Those Immigrants. Turning us all gay.
[3:05:03] <spaceitaly> immigants, i knew it was them, even when it was the pale i knew it was them

[3:05:12] <%hax_metatron> That is a form of Fascism
[3:05:14] <SpartanAltego> Woolie you don't have the pass, don't use the K-word.
[3:05:20] <%gatorafan> From MY p-
[3:05:21] <CatRidder> THE ANGLOS
[3:05:22] <laserbeaming> Fascism and Nationalism go hand in hand
[3:05:24] <derap41> Woolie its the same thing
[3:05:26] <%hax_metatron> Fascism embraces Nationalism
[3:05:27] <lyzejag> It's still facist though adjacent, they are cousins
[3:05:28] <%HeroToxiko> LUL k is a slur for what kim is
[3:05:31] <Ids560> they are the same thing
[3:05:35] <%krispen_wa> nationalism is a front for fascism
[3:05:37] <%X2Eliah> It's almost like they are very similar
[3:05:48] <leith_aziz> Anyone had problems finding PS4 controllers anywhere right now? I've searched in many stores and they're all sold out. i might be fucked before the Strive beta unless I buy a PS5 controller and use Remote Play...

[3:06:57] <Hydrapissed> it was cooler
[3:06:59] <spaceitaly> rorschach was DEFINITELY the good guy
[3:07:00] <%HeroToxiko> while nationalism isn't necessarily fascism, but a particular brand of nationalism is blatant fascism yes
[3:07:01] <Mr_Zero5232> @gunsrlove nationalism is polygamous, they fuck with every ism they can
[3:07:02] <%jepupu> Oh yeah
[3:07:02] <CatRidder> or you can use you money to help society
[3:07:07] <%X2Eliah> oh 4 real?
[3:07:13] <DSD24> Then that lady yells at Tony Stark and calls him a piece of crap

[3:07:24] <Asuterisuku> Cap was straight up wrong, by the way.
[3:07:28] <%jepupu> Speedball was one of them, I think
[3:07:28] <Tennochief> Neither Civil War events are good
[3:07:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> Vigilantism is a crime for a reason
[3:07:34] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Speedball ain‚Äôt shit tier you‚Äôre shit tier!!!
[3:07:35] <%HeroToxiko> @DSD24 she was right too
[3:07:36] <TrueSatanos> You're not a vigilante if you're governing your own nation
[3:07:36] <dbag202> Oh yeah, Iron Man was correct
[3:07:36] <Tennochief> Civil War 2 is even worse
[3:07:41] <ingman112> Nah Tony crossed the line when he signed up villains and cloned thor
[3:07:44] <Lancaster_H> @WoolieVersus might wanna go back and check out the jamrock shuffle answer, gets you a thought
[3:07:44] <ToxInjection> but I wanna keep shooting dudes in the face! - Jason Todd, probably
[3:07:44] <%ChoculaUltra> we like to pretend Civil War 2 didn't exist.
[3:07:46] <%fetrigon> that's a much more compelling event
[3:07:47] <Mr_Zero5232> Yea and have Tony, a regular human get soapbox over it
[3:07:50] <%HeroToxiko> @AWKWARDL0SER stares in penance LUL

[3:08:09] <%fetrigon> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[3:08:11] <Tennochief> Civil War 2 is just straight up facism and Captain Marvel gets away scot free
[3:08:13] <aiutare47> Venture Bros has a great superhero system oddly enough
[3:08:13] <%jinking79> Phoenix Jones is the first name that comes to mind
[3:08:14] <Inqy833> Well the registration was wrong in the end... but only because they went out of the way to make Tony Stark and Reed Richards act like crazy people. They REALLY wanted you to pick Cap's side.

[3:14:21] <ulcaban> Disco as perpetual hangover
[3:14:28] <kikoeru_san> late 80s and 90s had too much crack to be disco
[3:14:29] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[3:14:33] <ToxInjection> It's more part of your identity
[3:14:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that makes sense
[3:14:36] <%wolfofsound> true
[3:14:40] <%X2Eliah> Ppl who got stuck in 90s had the WORST luck
[3:14:41] <Lelfro> we will be old men in hoodies
[3:14:41] <Klefth> Aka older millenials and the 90s
[3:14:41] <TrueSatanos> It's what you feel comfortable in
[3:14:47] <iacus_> the haircut you keep is the one you get dates with
[3:14:48] <resloxxx> the clothes make the man
[3:15:02] <mr_sups> Flannal
[3:15:03] <linSP> better wear those cyberpunk clothes or be a boomer
[3:15:05] <%KetsuoTaberu> I will be wearing hoodies and jeans for the rest of my life
[3:15:08] <ToxInjection> I do want to wear more smart clothing as I get older though
[3:15:11] <Mr_Zero5232> Some ppl stopped wearing bell bottoms only cause they stopped selling them in 00s
[3:15:11] <%X2Eliah> ppl stuck in this decade will wear hoodies forever
[3:15:24] <Monkeyweed21> decrepit old men wearing Supreme Hoodies
[3:15:29] <+Exicuren> Fanny packs, mullets
[3:15:29] <dukenux> ^

[3:15:57] <derap41> jeans has been worn for over 200 years
[3:15:59] <DSD24> Jeans and Hoodies are too comfy to die
[3:16:01] <yomamma133713> hoodies are immortal
[3:16:01] <%HeroToxiko> Jeans and hoodies have been a thing for a long long time

[3:16:10] <+justianxix> New age jeans, the neo jeans
[3:16:11] <DSD24> Plus Hoodies are nice
[3:16:11] <Indigo_Automaton> Hoodies are an archetype, not a fad
[3:16:12] <Inqy833> And then eventually things come back around because what was old becomes what's novel. All my friends are naming their children like, Albert and Ethel. Really grandparents names.

[3:16:21] <ToxInjection> Hoodies wll die off at SOME point. Decades from now, but they will. I'll still use my collection though
[3:16:25] <+Exicuren> Jeans and hoodies will be seen more like practical clothing than a fashion, I want to think
[3:16:25] <+Prevot> grandpa and his anime shirts, listening to his game soundtrack vinyls
[3:16:29] <+babyacid> im in my 40s and all my peers and myself are still doing hoodies and jeans

[3:16:41] <DSD24> Finger Guns!
[3:16:43] <%ChoculaUltra> just as long as people stop wearing hoodies under suit jackets I'll be fine.

[4:01:15] <%wolfofsound> @yusefHD true

[4:01:55] <+ATentacleMonster> have a great day y'all LuvSign
[4:01:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they still made fanta to be able to sell in germany tho
[4:02:03] <%Irridium> snopes has gone to shit lately
[4:02:04] <Asuterisuku> Not a real ad - but wouldn't be surprising if it WERE.
[4:02:08] <+yusefHD> Is this the real life, is this just fantasea
[4:02:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:02:17] <+Prevot> don't worry the fanta thing is still true
[4:02:18] <flamegawdferny> Don't you wanna wanna Fanta?
[4:02:19] <derap41> @Asuterisuku That's dangerous talk
[4:02:35] <QuicksilverMachine> @Irridium One of the owners left, it got worse then
[4:02:37] <+Jeshk0> !MOTIVATED
[4:02:37] <@Moobot> 2213 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:02:37] <+Bitscreed> The Fanta thing is actually quite fascinating.
[4:02:37] <bobdoletrasher> i like fanta
[4:02:48] <%krispen_wa> @lonosis47 no, I'm saying you sound like the people who think they're smart for  saying that people cant criticize facets of capitalism and society while living in it.
[4:03:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the fanta part is real tho
[4:03:29] <%nicversus> The TL;DR is that fanta was developed by coca cola in order to keep doing business in nazi germany during WWII without having the coca cola brand, which was associated with American values
[4:03:31] <iacus_> put that as an annotation in the youtube
[4:03:32] <flamegawdferny> TBH most don't people don't realize/care about the companies they get their products from
[4:03:40] <%BisoromiBear> thank god I can drink my flavored corn syrup with a clean conscience
[4:03:58] <%krispen_wa> Fanta is Nazi juice
[4:04:01] <+OblivionSword1> yeah the fanta one was real
[4:04:07] <DatAsuna> Fanta was basically left over ingredients repurposed yeah
[4:04:19] <Robot_Nixon_> I hate all products :)
[4:04:19] <yomamma133713> fanta yes
[4:04:26] <derap41> Still Fucking evil

[4:04:36] <Robot_Nixon_> back to monke with me
[4:04:41] <+yusefHD> Anyone else have immigrant parents who call all flavoured soda fanta tho? LUL
[4:04:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Tuna_Can_0 take me with you
[4:05:01] <pi_in_the_sci> Fanta exists because Coke bottling plants in Germany could get the right ingredients because of blockades
[4:05:07] <%Javaa01> Yeah I don't know what was up with that stroke
[4:05:09] <andre11dr> Well,i don't know how to tell you ,but most research in medicine dose come from the files they took from the experiments the Nazi did
[4:05:09] <%KetsuoTaberu> ? LUL
[4:05:14] <flamegawdferny> I'm curious, do Neo-Nazi's use Fanta like Fago with Juggalos?
[4:05:15] <+yusefHD> LOL
[4:05:17] <%Javaa01> I saw it roll by in chat and I got nothin
