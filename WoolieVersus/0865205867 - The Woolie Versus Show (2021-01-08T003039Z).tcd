[0:26:16] <%gatorafan> @wishywashyofsaddlearabia, tbh this game kind of goes to the other extremes. Buff/Nerf like 6 times a day is crazy.
[0:26:22] <jubejube56> there was frame data AND detailed frame data

[0:31:48] <ufusnake> don't press anything to block
[0:32:39] <%Jetzord> @LiquidDinosaur press back or don't press anything
[0:33:53] <anarchistPastry> smart they put it on Heavies, putting guaranteed combos on slower attacks with longer hitstop makes hit confirms more approachable

[0:39:15] <xeros720> what did they call it in tatsunoko vs. capcom?
[0:39:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Wait in Arena they call a Roman Cancel a 1More? That's good
[0:39:17] <+MatthewRobo> is this game love themed because there are romantic ccancels
[0:39:49] <jubejube56> you can rapid it tho
[0:40:04] <jubejube56> just not the last hit

[1:46:05] <stevo_scar> How consistent has the rollback for this?
[1:46:18] <jubejube56> inconsistent from my experience but it is early beta
[1:46:22] <Apooocalypse> it's solid but longer sets get a little stuttery
[1:46:38] <Apooocalypse> since it's browser based it's very difficult to make consistent rollback
[1:46:42] <+QueequegTheater> Curses

[1:52:20] <%Ecchigun> whats going on
[1:52:21] <stevo_scar> im pretty certain this uses webrtc, I wish I could hitup the devs
[1:53:08] <MyNameIsRasus> I SMELL LIKE BEEF
[1:53:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1346351996379521026
[1:53:42] <jubejube56> people are indeed throwing out tier lists
[1:53:44] <+ChopmanFGC> UltraDavid has a tier list
[1:53:47] <Louie_Salmon> There's always a tier list.
[1:53:48] <SFdvus> first google auto complete
[1:54:03] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Have you Woolie and Reggie have been asked about which "type" of character in a fighter you like more? Grappler, Shoto, Tech-guy, etc
[1:54:03] <Apooocalypse> there are plenty of those clowns who just put whoever they hate on top 1 and their character on bottom 1
[1:54:11] <ufusnake> It's been out for like 4 day
[1:54:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Apparently UltraDavid has one
[1:54:12] <jubejube56> there are tiers on youtube I think
[1:54:16] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus theoptionselect has one
[1:54:20] <panlakes> that noodle yell is fantastic
[1:54:21] <jubejube56> they keep getting recommended to me
[1:54:33] <+Hobo_Boxer> Just make a parody ranking them by flavors Kappa
[1:54:47] <Triplicat> carbs top tier
[1:55:01] <ufusnake> but Beef is top tier in my heart
[1:55:05] <+QueequegTheater> Garlic is A, Rice is B, Beef is C, Pork and Noodle are D and Onion is F
[1:55:12] <+QueequegTheater> I found it via Bing search
[1:55:16] <jubejube56> OFFICIAL
[1:55:35] <+ChopmanFGC> NOODLE D-TIER LUL
[1:55:37] <Apooocalypse> every single tier list i've seen has been trash
[1:55:38] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus wait
[1:55:43] <joshua_42> Time to wait another week for more KOFXV gameplay
[1:55:43] <+QueequegTheater> I think it's literally a random
[1:55:52] <jubejube56> I recall seeing one tier where Noodle was the best character in the game but Rice is the worst in the game
[1:55:58] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The optionselect article is literally a random generator

[2:15:11] <+QueequegTheater> Of course Woolie loves the one with a Big Band punch
[2:15:13] <ufusnake> Controller support is still being worked on so maybe it's a bug
[2:15:21] <dizimous> @queequegtheater No ya I getcha, just throwing out a line in case anyone knew what to do. Thanks anyways

[2:55:21] <%DatAsuna> that shit's been out for like 3 days and it's in the game
[2:55:38] <+QueequegTheater> fake fan alert
[2:55:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Kyle Katarn looks like such a generic dude
[2:55:54] <ThatDamnTyrant> jar jar room BibleThump

[2:56:49] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus just HMU if you want malgus lore lol the wiki's kinda light on recent swtor content
[2:56:52] <+QueequegTheater> THAT'S NOT HOW BALANCE WORKS THO
[2:56:52] <%Struggleful> woolieLORE
[2:56:56] <+QueequegTheater> BALANCE MEANS NO SITH
[2:56:59] <Super_Voltekka> jizz music
[2:57:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:57:07] <+BillHicks5051> That Jedi history sounds like a retcon
[2:57:13] <DontChuckle98> @super_voltekka If he’s actually gonna be in this, he better be the most op character for the memes. Lol
[2:57:17] <KeiPrime> there a wookieepedia entry on tiddie
[2:57:20] <%DatAsuna> I'm just saying, the wiki's missing half the lore lol
[2:57:21] <+BillHicks5051> Jeedi?
[2:57:26] <%DatAsuna> There is a tiddie article
[2:57:28] <ThatDamnTyrant> Wait how is no sith "balance"?
[2:57:31] <Nekros4442> I feel like Obi should just have a bunch of counter stances
[2:57:33] <%DatAsuna> it has exactly one piece of worthwhile trivia
[2:57:37] <MyNameIsRasus> @KeiPrime There should be one for booba fett
[2:57:37] <+BillHicks5051> Fuck all Disney lore
[2:57:42] <+QueequegTheater> @ThatDamnTyrant According to Lucas the Sith are a corruption of the Force
[2:57:45] <+vaporousTippler> That didn't look like Soresu.
[2:57:45] <%DatAsuna> which should just be on the species page for mon cal tbh
[2:57:46] <$Invlux> The more I learn about Star Wars, the lamer it gets
[2:57:48] <KeiPrime> cause of that broad with six tits
[2:57:49] <haitakaa> man the final season of clone wars was so good
[2:57:49] <+QueequegTheater> NOT the other side of the coin
[2:57:54] <SFdvus> equality means i get both halfs
[2:58:14] <+BillHicks5051> Look looks tweaked
[2:58:17] <+BillHicks5051> Luke

[2:59:08] <+QueequegTheater> I'm pretty sure this is the part from from Rebels not KOTOR 2
[2:59:10] <@Solidus_113> Asokha fights vader here
[2:59:10] <%TheBensonator_> WHAT IS THAT SHIT
[2:59:13] <$Invlux> @DatAsuna the more Souls you have, the more physically large you are Kappa
[2:59:22] <MyNameIsRasus> I wonder if Malachor 5 is still fucked up by the time the movies come around in the lore

[3:01:59] <%DatAsuna> the bloodborne one
[3:02:06] <Nekros4442> I'm surprised Rey isnt one shotting people
[3:02:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Fallen Jedi?
[3:02:11] <+QueequegTheater> I could play Fallen Order, or I could just play Sekiro again
[3:02:23] <Dhurkst> @DatAsuna A lot closer to Sekiro, actually
[3:02:26] <+jiggy_snipe> sure...
[3:02:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Fallen Order, mb
[3:02:30] <+jiggy_snipe> still silly
[3:02:32] <%Struggleful> CELL
[3:02:34] <SFdvus> can they us it to fly?
[3:02:35] <townzzzzz> fly away
[3:02:41] <+Carlos_the_Hobo> Teleporting light saber
[3:02:44] <%DatAsuna> @Dhurkst ironically yes, but the director literally said it was inspired by bloodborne, so
[3:02:48] <+heyitsdenzel_> i want to get away
[3:02:52] <DontChuckle98> So basically they have Rayman lightsabers. Lol
[3:02:56] <MyNameIsRasus> hey soul sister
[3:03:02] <+slick9909> can you fly with it?
[3:03:03] <+vaporousTippler> Hey look. It's nobody important.
[3:03:05] <+BillHicks5051> This looks pretty sick
[3:03:11] <@Solidus_113> they're ripped from battlefront 2 most likely
[3:03:14] <%DatAsuna> they both iterated on bloodborne and seperately made the same decisions, it's funny.
[3:03:18] <+megaman_sentinel> they use them 2 fly away lol
[3:03:19] <bleugh> stormtroopers just standing there
[3:03:26] <%DatAsuna> yeah most of these seem to be rips

[3:03:55] <%DatAsuna> Gideon might be custom tho
[3:03:58] <%Jetzord> @DontChuckle98 I mean, you want to get in between two fighting Force users?
[3:04:00] <robotman37> @DontChuckle98 I mean I would chill too if i saw a lightsaber duel
[3:04:06] <Dhurkst> @QueequegTheater Fallen Order is worth it as an action-adventure Tomb-Raider-esque game, though the combat is janky.
[3:04:07] <%DatAsuna> unless he's in that mobile game

[3:36:22] <Super_Voltekka> The Saudis didn't cover Mai up ukogGERS
[3:36:28] <+jiggy_snipe> gamers have short term memory
[3:36:37] <@Solidus_113> 2002 UM coming to PS4 with rollback
[3:36:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Gamers just don't care unfortunately
[3:37:04] <%DatAsuna> to differing degrees though
[3:37:19] <Dhurkst> No such thing as ethical consumption is false. It only applies to larger corporations
[3:37:20] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Woolie if you don't want to support it, don't. It's cool
[3:37:25] <SFdvus> i wont get snk due to the fact that is a direct connection to a dictator
[3:37:25] <%DatAsuna> anyone pushing that as a moral relativism thing is not gonna budge yeah
[3:37:40] <@Solidus_113> People STILL play Blizzard games
[3:37:58] <majindusto> Just Don't Support It
[3:38:03] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie you aren't required to like SNK games
[3:38:15] <EndgameContent> The developers are already paid, baby!!
[3:38:21] <Dhurkst> It's only as complicated as you choose to make it
[3:38:34] <ThatDamnTyrant> Remember the ActiBlizz Hongkong shit?
[3:38:36] <+rnajed> that's ok
[3:38:41] <SFdvus> @Dhurkst like everything
[3:38:44] <majindusto> If YOU don't want to play it...Ok
[3:38:49] <%DatAsuna> what if terry slapped 6 asses instead?
[3:38:51] <%DemonOfSalt> "Pick your battles."
[3:38:55] <EndgameContent> Don't negotiate with terrorists, even if they're holding your favorite devs or IPs hostage.
[3:39:06] <Equirah> ^
[3:39:13] <Mvrdok_> It's a very grey situation
[3:39:19] <ThatDamnTyrant> @DatAsuna Tempting...
[3:39:19] <SFdvus> @EndgameContent agree
[3:39:20] <EndgameContent> There are other fighting games and other devs to support that also don't work under a fucked up and bigoted regime.
[3:39:23] <+TungstenViper> wait what?
[3:39:27] <Equirah> they'll find work elsewhere, don't give money to them
[3:39:29] <%Struggleful> Know about what chat? I missed it
[3:39:31] <+trackles_64> its not really grey developers have to stand up to management
[3:39:39] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Everyone has there own lines.
[3:39:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1346351996379521026
[3:39:53] <%DatAsuna> like kotor 2 -_-
[3:39:56] <+catman042285> see poison
[3:39:57] <+TungstenViper> what0s the controversy?
[3:39:57] <Super_Voltekka> Yoshitora from SamSho was designed by a pedophile
[3:40:00] <EndgameContent> Also, when you pay for games, a lot of that money gets stuck up at the top and middle management.
[3:40:02] <@Solidus_113> https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1347329050583461892 Woolie's question
[3:40:05] <SFdvus> snk devs should just leave the company
[3:40:11] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a valid position to be in
[3:40:29] <+jiggy_snipe> that was also SNK Kappa
[3:40:32] <Dhurkst> @EndgameContent the devs are paid, but the less money a company has, the more everyone in it suffers, especially devs. Working conditions, layoffs, etc.
[3:40:33] <%DatAsuna> crunch is bad, but there's a level above of actual murder
[3:40:35] <ShadowpulseKDH1> @tungstenviper Saudi princes bought KoF
[3:40:42] <+TungstenViper> oh, the Saudi Arabia ownership
[3:40:52] <%liquidfox27> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[3:40:52] <+vaporousTippler> We shouldn't have bought DMC 3. Those maniacs were responsible for DMC 2.
[3:41:01] <Equirah> seperation with tencent? the biggest media company in China? suuuuure
[3:41:16] <EndgameContent> @Dhurkst When a company's wallets are hurt, they suddenly start reconsidering the financial realities of their decisions.
[3:41:28] <SFdvus> literally paying with your wallet for more murder
[3:41:29] <%DatAsuna> even 1 layer of seperation is more than none
[3:41:37] <+trackles_64> Well China uses slave labor so itts only your morals.
[3:41:39] <+jiggy_snipe> the company that MBS owns, owns or will own a majority of SNK
[3:41:45] <EndgameContent> @Dhurkst That's why, for example, PogChamp is being replaced. If people are pissed off, that's bad news for brand and business.
[3:42:30] <Equirah> if they're already in a position where they can push their friends into board positions then it's too late
[3:42:31] <%DemonOfSalt> "It's healthy to have these conversations." woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:42:36] <%DatAsuna> though speaking of pogchamp i did have to unfollow several people after yesterday's reactions :s
[3:43:06] <Dhurkst> @EndgameContent Tell that to Activision & EA. The higher ups don't give a shit, while the devs suffer.
[3:43:16] <%DatAsuna> ubisoft *cougcough*
[3:43:16] <EndgameContent> @DatAsuna Bummer, it's a shame when people decide to show their whole asses for no reason.
[3:43:26] <SFdvus> why are people mad a gootecks for having opions
[3:43:30] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah the cleanup after yesterday was oof
[3:43:37] <+TungstenViper> what did the Saudi prince do?
[3:43:39] <Equirah> yeah hypocrites are scum
[3:43:40] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus that also happened with Modern Warfare 2
[3:43:43] <+trackles_64> Ubioft covers up managment rape crimes soooo
[3:43:48] <SomersaultJustice> what was the boycott for left 4 dead 2 about?
[3:43:51] <prime_name> Why boycott LFD2?
[3:43:53] <+rnajed> you'd have to stop buying gas to stop supporting saudi
[3:43:53] <EndgameContent> @SFdvus Because he's having shitty opinions, and that's the natural reaction.
[3:43:59] <@akuda_bar> i think he's misremembering, wasnt it some other game
[3:43:59] <Equirah> @Solidus_113 he meant that one but just remembered the "2" LUL
[3:44:07] <ThatDamnTyrant> DONT THINK CONSUME PRODUCT
[3:44:08] <%mr_miyagucci> Theres no ethical consumption under any wide range economic system because all of them are based on the ideal that wealth will somehow spread to masses of ppl, because of this its very hard if not impossible to not find money in the hands of shitty ppl. That being said MBS is a shithead and not wanting to support him is as understandable as still wanting to support the devs that make it
[3:44:12] <bleugh> i completely forget what the l4d2 drama was
[3:44:14] <%DatAsuna> i don't remember the l2d2 one yeah
[3:44:17] <@Solidus_113> The L4D2 boycott was because it came out a year after L4D1, a game that didn't get a lot of support
[3:44:34] <Dhurkst> @SFdvus Opinions have never been sacred. They warrant response.
[3:45:07] <SFdvus> yea but if im wrong hes just sad that people are getting killed
[3:45:13] <%mr_miyagucci> MBS is further than i want to go however. Maybe i will buy used but._.
[3:45:16] <EndgameContent> "That's just my opinion" well that's a shitty opinion and it makes me hate you, congrats
[3:45:23] <%DatAsuna> someone has to mention it
[3:45:25] <+TungstenViper> what did the prince do to be problematic?
[3:45:26] <Dhurkst> @EndgameContent exactly
[3:45:29] <prime_name> Some people just want to focus on the video game for their own peace of mind.
[3:45:29] <@Solidus_113> thoughts and prayers
[3:45:32] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[3:45:33] <rcand9> LUL
[3:45:41] <%DatAsuna> sephiroth cut the boycoott
[3:45:43] <%kyh9> Nintendo knows what you want
[3:45:46] <%TheBensonator_> lul
[3:45:56] <%kyh9> Being an asshole isn't being unethical
[3:45:57] <%liquidfox27> woolieS woolieT
[3:45:59] <%DatAsuna> There's leagues of shittiness
[3:46:00] <UltimateDomon> Smash news has the Sakurai Separator
[3:46:01] <%liquidfox27> woolieF woolieU
[3:46:06] <stevo_scar> It's easier to not look at it. "Already did my part by being informed"
[3:46:08] <bleugh> too slow
[3:46:09] <%kyh9> Being an asshole isn't illegal or even really immoral
[3:46:10] <%DemonOfSalt> It's also hard to boycott things when you're friends don't give a shit about your moral actions and won't shut up about the very things you are boycotting.
[3:46:15] <%ChoculaUltra> watch Nintendo throw like Goku in as the last dlc character. I guarantee you Smash players will be planning tournies like nothing happened LUL
[3:46:15] <MyNameIsRasus> there's a power gap between that and actual murder
[3:46:16] <+jiggy_snipe> @SFdvus he wanted more protests specifically. you can judge whether it was a bad opinion or not
[3:46:29] <%DemonOfSalt> *your friends
[3:46:30] <%DatAsuna> Nintendo hasn't murdered anyone that we know of
[3:46:37] <%DatAsuna> not yet
[3:46:39] <majindusto> I Already had the SEASON PASS From Last Year!!!
[3:46:42] <Dhurkst> @mr_miyagucci It's false that there's no ethical consumption. It's just unethical with big companies. Like hell buying something at your local mom & pop shop is unethical.
[3:46:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:46:55] <MyNameIsRasus> @DatAsuna unless those microsoft execs' self esteem after they laughed them off
[3:47:01] <MyNameIsRasus> except**
[3:47:02] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean doesn't Nintendo like own Sega? And Sega is in cahoots with the Yakuzies. Ya never know LUL
[3:47:03] <+jiggy_snipe> oooo Sephiroth, what's FreeMelee Kappa
[3:47:04] <Grimsever88> people think gootecks supports violence but i just think he thinks that lady was innocent... for whatever reason
[3:47:04] <%DatAsuna> gotem
[3:47:08] <SFdvus> i don't want more protest but i still think its overreaction
[3:47:12] <Jaller101514> @datasuna not according to Pat Kappa
[3:47:20] <%DemonOfSalt> Nah Woolie, you're being entirely reasonable.
[3:47:23] <SFdvus> thanks for the info
[3:47:34] <ZenobyGoat> it pays to be critical
[3:47:40] <ShadowpulseKDH1> From on High
[3:47:42] <+jiggy_snipe> @Grimsever88 it's complicated. she was technically unarmed I think
[3:47:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Nah Gootecks was also out here earlier this year trying to say covid wasn't real too. He's BEEN wilding out, not just on Trump shit.
[3:48:06] <Mvrdok_> It's hard to stick to your values when everyone else doesn't care
[3:48:14] <Dhurkst> @ChoculaUltra Isn't he an anti-vaxxer, too?
[3:48:24] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Yes
[3:48:26] <%ChoculaUltra> hell, his last tweet was a fucking Alex Jones video he was recording with his phone - dude is GONE GONE.
[3:48:28] <rcand9> @Grimsever88 except he called her a martyr and called for more civil unrest
[3:48:28] <SFdvus> i mean crosscounter isnt doing to well
[3:48:29] <EndgameContent> I think it's also important to realize that the spreading and validating of the shit Gootecks spews ends up causing material harm to people who really can't afford to be harmed.
[3:48:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Gootecks seems big into conspiracy theories. He's off the deep end
[3:48:51] <Mvrdok_> @WoolieVersus Good stuff
[3:48:54] <SomersaultJustice> we're not gonna not watch?
[3:48:56] <Jaller101514> Whats the moral stance on pirating the game?
[3:49:12] <EndgameContent> Yo Woolie go watch the new MonHun Rise trailer instead
[3:49:16] <KeiPrime> thats a lot of talking to avoid 20 seconds of watching
[3:49:18] <%liquidfox27> woolieMIRIN
[3:49:19] <Mvrdok_> Damn
[3:49:20] <+TungstenViper> none
[3:49:21] <DrkJP520> we talking about saudi snk?
[3:49:21] <KeiPrime> cause the trailer is nothing
[3:49:22] <EndgameContent> Pirating is a-okay
[3:49:23] <+jiggy_snipe> if you don't wanna support it, don't touch it at all
[3:49:33] <rcand9> LUL do big pirates
[3:49:36] <Grimsever88> KOF2k2 is now on ps4 with rollback too
[3:49:38] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't know who owns what exactly at Crosscounter, but I expect people to distance themselves from gootecks even more with the weeks to come. I hope Mike Ross doesn't get dragged down with him.
[3:49:40] <rcand9> yar
[3:49:43] <ThatDamnTyrant> BASED... in Minecraft of course
[3:49:47] <ManJazzSSBM> As a Melee player, Piracy is an absolute must.
[3:49:47] <Dhurkst> @KeiPrime right?
[3:49:57] <%DemonOfSalt> Please don't feel pressured to play something you don't want for our sake.
[3:50:01] <stevo_scar> @WoolieVersus is the barrel still overflowing in the meantime
[3:50:08] <MyNameIsRasus> imagine if this shit continues and they just buy more shit
[3:50:13] <MyNameIsRasus> that would be so fucking sad
[3:50:17] <SFdvus> mike is to busy play dota 2
[3:50:22] <SFdvus> playing
[3:50:24] <%DatAsuna> F
[3:50:25] <SomersaultJustice> @stevo_scar I mean, they haven't even played Ragnagard yet Kappa
[3:50:25] <%mr_miyagucci> Mike separated from cross counter years ago he will be ok
[3:50:34] <EndgameContent> Hey Woolie, have you had a chance to check out No Straight Roads by any chance?
[3:50:37] <%ChoculaUltra> it would be depressing af to know purchasing games now funds war crimes. Like genuinely gut wrenching shit.
[3:50:40] <+waltzqueen> @WoolieVersus is there a place to watch your outro on demand? sometimes it's all i wanna see
[3:50:48] <UltimateDomon> Skullgirls ain't an issue for me cause the old crew got it now
[3:50:50] <rcand9> could you borrow someone else copy and have a disclaimer before you stream it?
[3:51:02] <UltimateDomon> Mike Z has been totally removed from the equation so going forward it's all good
[3:51:04] <@Solidus_113> Look forward to Annie coming out
[3:51:15] <%CptnCampy61> @woolieversus appreciate you guys keeping your morals at the forefront. Especially this week...cheers boys
[3:51:17] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[3:51:20] <stevo_scar> @SomersaultJustice oh that looks like good times
[3:51:20] <EndgameContent> @UltimateDomon Did the new company they created get the rights to it?
[3:51:23] <Dhurkst> @waltzqueen vods, I guess
[3:51:23] <%ChoculaUltra> Outros are MANGA ONLY
