[0:02:38] <+Sword_of_Stupid> Hope we get English again I love my himbo
[0:02:40] <Darkdrill> start :O
[0:02:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! yee, 28 months the day if a like a dragon stream, good day, one month closer to strive so I don't have to die inside playing games I love with bad online....dbfz...
[0:02:53] <Burningfajitas> man im so hyped to play Y:LAD, im maybe 1/3rd through yakuza 5 right now, then goin for 6
[0:02:56] <Darkdrill> nice i made it in time
[0:03:05] <Blank9> 5 finishes strong
[0:03:05] <Hopit> I don't have to turn my clocks for like 1 ½ weeks so I was super confused
[0:03:09] <%ZweihanderSteve> real bread hours
[0:03:21] <bronzeaxe> its been 21 years since sonichu was created today, this beings upon a great horror
[0:03:26] <%TooManyGs> @sword_of_stupid me too! my uncle voices a character later on and I wanna see that interaction
[0:03:30] <%zanzibar_junker> Ichiban is the Exile while Kiryu in s Ravan
[0:03:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> I got the stories for 5 and 6 but skipped em cause the games start going downhill storywise from 4 forward except for 7
[0:03:47] <%dreadedcthulhu> dreadedcthulhu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! hey woolie! if you haven't already checked it out or been flooded with the suggestion, READ CHAINSAW MAN! one of the best jump manga I've read in a long time
[0:04:15] <Darkdrill> to bad i cant skip real live and go straight into the intro
[0:04:35] <%Superdandy96> Man it’s going to be gameplay whiplash when Woolz and V return to Yakuza 0.
[0:04:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> what if today is your intro
[0:04:50] <%cache_22> With Disco Elysium Director's Cut out on March 30th it looks like the next LP is not too far off then.
[0:04:58] <Blank9> ichiban's 42 by the time it's chapter 2 of his story
[0:05:08] <%zanzibar_junker> Bane Asylum
[0:05:08] <extradopeness> Im at D4C part 8 in Steel Ball Run right now , this shits insane
[0:05:10] <bronzeaxe> @superdandy96 yeah i thought I had whiplash after I played 0 then Kiwami 1
[0:05:14] <%jepupu> Hobo vs. CHINESE MEN
[0:05:18] <%zanzibar_junker> Bane City
[0:05:21] <+Sword_of_Stupid> @toomanygs that’s pretty sick! A lot of people have enjoyed his work then.
[0:05:21] <Prevot> I wonder how many more sessions of this they'll do, cause it's looking like it's gonna take all year to finish 0
[0:05:21] <@Solidus_113> Depending on actual release hours, the LP could start thursday, if not later Tuesday
[0:05:23] <Blank9> still wild he's as old as Akiyama, and Akiyama's been around for 11 years
[0:05:35] <Burningfajitas> the wildest of whiplashes is kiwami 2 to 3
[0:05:35] <xpakeo> kiw 2 to 3 is rough
[0:05:48] <PanicSwytch> Sourpls
[0:05:49] <+projectmanatees> man i wish akiyama got a spin off game
[0:05:50] <@Solidus_113> but it means we got a free slot for a one-off LP. and I'm gonna shill Superliminal until I die
[0:05:56] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[0:05:59] <Blank9> He sorta got a spinoff with Dead Souls
[0:06:13] <DSD24> Superliminal is that perspective game right?
[0:06:14] <+projectmanatees> least we got disco on the 30th banyaPog
[0:06:14] <Prevot> we don't talk about Dead Souls
[0:06:15] <frostyjay3> "It's not a game"
[0:06:16] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:06:20] <bronzeaxe> DarkMode
[0:06:22] <DSD24> Dead Souls was fun
[0:06:26] <+Fiiib> still holding out for that Ace Combat 7 playthrough
[0:06:33] <DSD24> Controls were so jank though
[0:06:36] <Darkdrill> the dokapon saga was epic
[0:06:38] <Prevot> SourPls
[0:06:41] <bronzeaxe> dwarf fortress when?
[0:06:47] <Blank9> I do wish they localized Ishin though, I played through that entire game and it's like, the best fanservice game ever.
[0:06:47] <+projectmanatees> are we assuming its gona be reggie for disco?
[0:06:51] <%TooManyGs> would I be doing myself a disservice by skipping Yakuza 3?
[0:06:59] <Darkdrill> woolie vs dwarf's
[0:07:07] <Blank9> Random Yakuza characters playing the roles of historical Japanese characters in the Meiji era, it's wild.
[0:07:10] <%Superdandy96> Dokapon Saga was amazing. Both the anime adaptations and Manga were great!
[0:07:12] <frostyjay3> "So you know we were out there"
[0:07:13] <bronzeaxe> @toomanygs I thought 3 was the first good one?
[0:07:18] <+projectmanatees> @TooManyGs depands how invested in the series you are
[0:07:21] <%zanzibar_junker> There's a couple of sub story characters that debut in 3
[0:07:26] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @TooManyGs not really, just read up on what happens in the story and you'll be fine. It isn't a very fun game to play through
[0:07:30] <%Fefe41> 3 gets mixed reviews but I enjoyed it a lot
[0:07:36] <%zanzibar_junker> that are still in 7
[0:07:43] <@Solidus_113> Yakuza 4 has the complete catchup videos, so you might be fine
[0:07:54] <%Fefe41> Because it starts getting different from 1 and 2 so the older fans didn't like the change in tone
[0:08:06] <Burningfajitas> i had a really bad time with yakuza 3 battle wise because of the "lmao enemies block everything" stuff but i wouldn't say it's not worth playing
[0:08:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:22] <Blank9> I started with 3, but after playing 1 and 2 later I can definitely see why they'd be mad about it
[0:08:28] <xpakeo> @TooManyGs i beat it last week and i enjoyed most of it. the gameplay is effy but the characters are awesome enough to save the game
[0:08:33] <%runegod20> i've only seen from 0-3, and 7, but i don't think you should skip the games too much
[0:08:54] <ndcoten> just started playing a couple days ago; gonna work on management mode while watching the stream today i think
[0:08:55] <bronzeaxe> man dwarf fortress on steam is gonna look neat, I hope they allow for steam mods
[0:08:55] <%TooManyGs> thanks everyone! gave me a lot to think about!
[0:08:57] <+projectmanatees> never skip 5
[0:09:02] <%zanzibar_junker> 3 is Kiryu's VA's favorite because Kiryu finally got out off of his she'll.
[0:09:15] <%zanzibar_junker> shell
[0:09:19] <Burningfajitas> yeah Yakuza 3 is very important character development wise for Kiryu
[0:09:20] <morningmoondude> 3 to 5 set to EASY difficulty
[0:09:32] <ndcoten> so far i am very fond of shutting down shareholder arguments with omelette
[0:09:37] <Prevot> so kiryu's shell was a gray suit?
[0:09:41] <+projectmanatees> the orphanage bits are nice
[0:09:43] <DSD24> Yakuza 5 has that Kiryu heat move where he drags the dudes face on the pavement
[0:09:45] <Tiittamari> good to finally catch this live
[0:09:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> 3 was the one that had the awesome interview with actual yakuza about how kiryu would be put down immediately because of how much of a liability he is right?
[0:09:53] <Burningfajitas> @zanzibarian_hamster so it was
[0:09:54] <Blank9> 5 carries over straight to 6 too.
[0:10:01] <srv4254> i played 3 on easy because of the blocking
[0:10:08] <%zanzibar_junker> 5 is heavy
[0:10:23] <+projectmanatees> SourPls
[0:10:28] <restingbones> woomy woolie?
[0:10:38] <valriot> Doom DLC tomorrow Kreygasm doodCrazy Kreygasm doodCrazy Kreygasm doodCrazy
[0:10:40] <Blank9> Like, you could easier skip 3 and 4 than 5 I think.
[0:10:41] <%TooManyGs> every Yakuza game I've played has made me cry so far so I expect heavy
[0:10:44] <%ZweihanderSteve> i forgot about this song LUL
[0:10:50] <+Diredoe> @ndcoten "How can you justify these expenses?"  "B-GAWK!"  "Oh, yes, of course <3 <3 <3"
[0:10:59] <slim_shady2019> I like the orphanage stuff, shows that Kiryu is really good with children. Gives him some layers
[0:11:09] <%krispen_wa> you cant skip 4 considering it introduces akiyama and saejima
[0:11:09] <xpakeo> i almost skipped 3 because how bad it felt compared to kiw 2 but i stuck with it and im not complaining
[0:11:11] <+shadic7700> ZEIG ZEON
[0:11:12] <bronzeaxe> @valriot I need to get the first one
[0:11:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Yo, this song is great
[0:11:19] <DSD24> 4 was really good
[0:11:26] <Blank9> The one big plus to 3 is Okinawa is great and beach Yakuza reminds me of Sonatine.
[0:11:31] <Hopit> Drop them Colonies
[0:11:31] <%runegod20> the beginning part is important to give each one a mini arc and story bit, but it drags the beginning part a bit

[0:11:44] <%runegod20> but that part is still good, it's just a bit slow and feels like filler
[0:11:48] <%zanzibar_junker> Coming from the OG 1 and 2, 3 was a fresh breath of air.
[0:11:57] <Doctadaking> There are no bad mainline Yakuza games. Some are just better than others
[0:11:58] <TTouchdown> Is this pro-fascism rap?

[0:12:26] <%Superdandy96> Reggie the hero woolieKICKDAD
[0:12:32] <leith_aziz> All Yakuza games in my opinion are great (as long as you replace the OG's with Kiwami)
[0:12:39] <Prevot> the real question is whether those PSP games are any good and if we'll ever get to play them
[0:12:41] <bronzeaxe> in the grim darkness of the far future there will be only Chris chan
[0:12:49] <leith_aziz> But there's a difference in quality really

[0:25:52] <+NopeBadguy> You're a big guy
[0:25:54] <syanplague> i have a hope that the reason part 6 is taking so long is because they are trying to do the same with part 5 and add some new stuff to add the story
[0:26:00] <Tracazoid> Maybe we should find a mod for Woolie that just turns all the enemies, bosses and characters in cutscenes during Arkham City into Bane.
[0:26:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> U U U U
[0:26:01] <dds333a> Honestly, the bosses aren't great, but Woolie wasn't doing himself any favors by straight up doing the Bane fight incorrectly

[0:38:06] <fuji_92> dub namba is awesome
[0:38:06] <Sulfur_Boride> I think you guys may get to karaoke. Just a warning, Ichiban's dub actor ain't a singer.
[0:38:08] <%TooManyGs> Woooo dub time! Hope they get to my uncle this stream
[0:38:11] <Halospaz117> Ok what is this "dub nanba is bad" bullshit I'm seeing?

[0:38:18] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:38:20] <MagumaDono> Soon, V. Soon. Can't wait to travel again orz
[0:38:20] <DSD24> I like doing cool things
[0:38:21] <NotHereToStream> 1st thing to do@:  go to japan
[0:38:21] <Solidnick18> things
[0:38:21] <@akuda_bar> i get my first dose tomorrow so SOON
[0:38:21] <+nanaki_ff14> Oh man is it possible to hit the English quest today>?
[0:38:21] <Tracazoid> In the before times
[0:38:22] <+VidulaSaix> @Sulfur_Boride Isnt that the point of Karaoke though, to be shit LUL
[0:38:22] <+BloodyBurney> i look forward to living in a society again
[0:38:23] <cj_art> i enjoy when the things are done
[0:38:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Remember FIGHTING GAME TOURNAMENTS? I remember.
[0:38:24] <+projectmanatees> i member
[0:38:27] <Blank9> also what, dub nanba is great
[0:38:27] <Meltgar> But V, that means you will have to deal with people Kappa
[0:38:29] <Solidnick18> i try
[0:38:31] <%patriotrenegade> vaguely
[0:38:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Remember outside
[0:38:34] <%ggbhtg> Imagine liking things LUL
[0:38:35] <Halospaz117> Dub Nanba is Greg Chun, therefore it is impossible for him to be bad
[0:38:37] <%X2Eliah> big member things
[0:38:37] <+aishman> I miss board game nights...
[0:38:38] <dds333a> I miss it
[0:38:38] <Blank9> he's yagami in judgement's dub too
[0:38:39] <+NopeBadguy> We could already be back to doing things if stupid deniers would stop doing things
[0:38:39] <%jonblnt> shaper1LETSGO
[0:38:40] <leith_aziz> Well I dont agree. Dub Nanba is awesome cuz its Greg Chun
[0:38:41] <%TooManyGs> member hugging people?
[0:38:44] <disflipmat> @X2Eliah oh wow, I played through with the dub so I had no idea. He's a great character in english anyway
[0:38:49] <SereneFox> I can't recall the before times, nor the fun of ren faires
[0:38:58] <Halospaz117> Seriously, I think Greg Chun might be my 2nd favorite VA after JYB
[0:38:59] <%ZweihanderSteve> dubbo
[0:39:01] <%runegod20> i do dig japanese nanba way more
[0:39:03] <thedudeinthered> Bruh, I just want to go to McGibbin’s and hit the arcades again....
[0:39:07] <DedlokPM> @nanaki_ff14 I kinda doubt it. IIRC it is like mid-game that it appears.
[0:39:08] <Sulfur_Boride> @VidulaSaix Well, you ain't wrong. Kiryu's JP actor apparently hated doing the karaoke originally since he had to learn how to sing BADLY
[0:39:08] <+nabs2099> Never thought I would be hyped to return to a dub!
[0:39:10] <syanplague> member being able to have hope for the future? i member
[0:39:16] <twoto858> So itchy...
[0:39:17] <Meltgar> So, would you guys BELIEVE we would have "dealed" with the cheesedemic if everyone put their shit together?
[0:39:21] <%runegod20> this is the first thing i've seen Greg Chun in and he's fantastic
[0:39:22] <+NopeBadguy> Yes
[0:39:25] <+samuraiknack> One more jab and I can finally go back to coughing on old people
[0:39:25] <Blank9> it's in every loading screen
[0:39:25] <exnuart> every loading screen
[0:39:29] <Blank9> take a taxi!
[0:39:29] <Solidnick18> yeah the loading screens are 8 bit
[0:39:30] <%Zeif00> every loading
[0:39:31] <pyjama_day> Dub Nanba to me is basically 'i am doing a cool voice, but its so much effort to keep it up that i forgot to emote.' Same as Tak from Judgement
[0:39:32] <+khalcipher> Englis dub?
[0:39:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> DORAGON QUESUTO
[0:39:33] <disflipmat> Yep, the 8 bit sprites increase as you get more party members
[0:39:34] <nicversus> I like Greg Chun Nanba, but I think it's fair to say the japanese VA works better.
[0:39:35] <Darren716> You mean a PS5?
[0:39:37] <%X2Eliah> Quick, install a HDD instead of the ssd
[0:39:39] <+Tuckerace0324> I love this visible grim on the clothing

[0:40:50] <+nanaki_ff14> I got my PS5, but all i play is that stupid Gundam game im addicted to and spend $100s of moneys
[0:40:53] <$ggbhtg> Visual Novella
[0:40:55] <leith_aziz> Thats insightful
[0:40:56] <+Razputin217> sipsipRude
[0:40:59] <SereneFox> How many internal organs must I sell for this "PS5"?
[0:40:59] <Sulfur_Boride> I like how Greg Chun distinguishes his Yagami and Nanba voices by making Nanba's battle grunt sound intentionally half-assed
[0:41:00] <dds333a> Rude, Ichiban
[0:41:04] <leith_aziz> Nanba strecthing
[0:41:04] <%runegod20> and they do unlock a way later to relisten to those conversations, which is nice
[0:41:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> stetching nanba?
[0:41:06] <+duichenko> after the Arkham vid that is ironic
[0:41:07] <nicversus> @WoolieVersus Nanba's english voice is Greg Chun, who is the english voice for the main character Yagami from Judgment
[0:41:08] <brachydios777> Genius
[0:41:09] <justcallmebobplease> "...You came up to talk to me, why are you checking your phone, Ichiban, SO RUDE!"
[0:41:09] <JetpackMcQuack> Dear woolie:
[0:41:10] <Solidnick18> taxi is so helpful
[0:41:10] <Darren716> MAKE SURE YOU USE TAXIS FIRST
[0:41:10] <+AnarchicAnimeFan51> Hey Taxi!
[0:41:11] <MagumaDono> Those party combos are GOLD. Don't sleep on em!
[0:41:11] <morningmoondude> Taxis are REALLY useful in a few hours
[0:41:14] <dds333a> Look at the stretching over here

[0:41:19] <Solidnick18> Dragonfish

[0:41:22] <Prevot> nani the fuck
[0:41:23] <mikesapartment> So it's... Like a Dragon
[0:41:24] <%abrupt_abe> It's Like a Dragon
[0:41:24] <+duichenko> that is not how I imagined Nanba :(
[0:41:25] <Darren716> You have to interact with them in order to unlock them
[0:41:27] <brachydios777> Luckily Taxis are cheap
[0:41:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's LIKE a dragon
[0:41:28] <Solidnick18> it means rebirth
[0:41:28] <masterfire23> like a dragonfish
[0:41:29] <CharlieDJohnson> never forget to "activate" a taxi if you see it, otherwise you wont be able to use that spot for fast travel
[0:41:29] <Doctadaking> Dub Nanba is Yagami from Judgment

[0:43:17] <nicversus> I keep calling him NAMBLA
[0:43:20] <Blank9> Nanba's basic attack also counts as magic damage, which is another rad thing for casters.
[0:43:22] <leith_aziz> You missed some great scenes with him
[0:43:27] <%kewlmyc> I like it. Not sure where the haters are coming from.
[0:43:29] <TigerClaws12> SKILLED

[0:46:57] <red_fox_zero> You can push it until the last 10 seconds.
[0:46:58] <%cache_22> That was Woolie's first "real" attempt at the minigame.
[0:46:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> He's so proud
[0:46:59] <+Hacerous> Cantastic!
[0:47:00] <%Lion_kun> Oh a B
[0:47:00] <ndcoten> make use of the Lucky Litterer, you rack up points real quick
[0:47:02] <$QueequegTheater> I would say 30 seconds is enough to go back but man, Woolie is INEXPERIENCED in GTA driving, huh
[0:47:02] <%runegod20> @brachydios777 i think one of the essence moves you learn in freelancer actually does that
[0:47:04] <GeneralSCPatton> Garbage truck and lady with trash bag leave a trail of many cans
[0:47:05] <DedlokPM> @Freakin_Wolfy First time playing it outside of the story forcing you
[0:47:10] <Jalexster> @Freakin_Wolfy His first time playing it out of the mandatory time you have to
[0:47:13] <Hopit> I played this minigame for 6+ hours 10/10 would can again
[0:47:17] <DSD24> There's some good shit in the rewards
[0:47:18] <%Lion_kun> I S ranked all difficulties.
[0:47:27] <brachydios777> @runegod20 Really?
[0:47:32] <@akuda_bar> i love this idea that the homeless are doing this because they want the street clean rather than money
[0:47:34] <%Interface23> Interface23 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:47:36] <aluddss> persona 5 track
[0:47:40] <leith_aziz> Well.......Its just more subtle in my areas
[0:47:41] <SunsetJack> You gotta ask yourself, how?
[0:47:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> someone SPREAD Cans for this game on clean Tokyo streets
[0:47:44] <dds333a> Climbing the mountain of recyclables
[0:47:50] <DatAsuna> youhavent seen japanese rivers
[0:47:52] <downwiththethickness99> Dont get Yen. Not worth it
[0:47:56] <MagumaDono> There are some collectables that are just helpful in there for later missions
[0:47:57] <samazam94> turns out Japan is super clean because of the homeless
[0:48:03] <%runegod20> yeah, one of the heat moves does different heat moves from the dragon engine, but it's based on being near stuff like traffic cones or signs, otherwise it's just a basic heat move
[0:48:04] <urkleturtle> maybe there's so little pollution because the hobos pick it all up?
[0:48:04] <xeros720> lots of random junk in here
[0:48:05] <+Stormiercashew> yeah the yen ones are garbo conversions
[0:48:06] <Sulfur_Boride> They recommend you NOT to exchange Can points for money
[0:48:12] <DatAsuna> i saw whole ass bikes tossed in the river
[0:48:12] <%Bosni9> Keep going down in the menu
[0:48:12] <+NopeBadguy> There's better stuff near the bottom of the menu
[0:48:15] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Yen not worth it, you get huge point boosts for each title you get
[0:48:18] <brachydios777> I imagine the Sotenbori river isn’t exactly clean
[0:48:20] <Darren716> Yeah read the rest of the menu
[0:48:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TREASURE SPOTTED
[0:48:20] <justcallmebobplease> Look at the menu bottom for cans
[0:48:21] <%runegod20> i think his inventory expands?
[0:48:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh yeah, just ignore the rest of the shop list
[0:48:23] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus THere was WAY more in the shop
[0:48:26] <justcallmebobplease> Good shit at menu bottom for can shop
[0:48:36] <%notsoy> yeah the higher difficulties on the can game can easily get you thousands
[0:48:40] <DSD24> AWW YEAH
[0:48:41] <leith_aziz> Nanba ALWAYS is so far
[0:48:42] <pi_in_the_sci> you can climb that ladder on your left
[0:48:43] <dds333a> Pretty high fidelity parking garage

[0:48:47] <%Noonoox12> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:48:48] <pyjama_day> @WoolieVersus Tip for this would be to actually save your cans for later on. Quite a few items from there are needed for sidequests and cost a tonne
[0:48:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NANBAS FAR AGAIN
[0:48:49] <DSD24> I love when that happens
[0:48:50] <%Noonoox12> Pog as fuck

[0:48:54] <%ZweihanderSteve> Even the parking garages look good in this game!!!
[0:48:57] <%BusterRepukken> seeing some homeless guy run at you down the street would be scary
[0:48:59] <malbarrough> Nanba Nyoom'd LUL
[0:48:59] <TigerClaws12> eat your heart out cyber punk
[0:49:00] <%notsoy> and those can points are obviously best spent on stuff, not money
[0:49:05] <ndcoten> it only occasionally does A Warp (if it takes more than 10s to resolve a path)
[0:49:07] <Doctadaking> He really IS a wizard!
[0:49:08] <Jalexster> They actually WILL teleport if they get stuck or take too long
[0:49:09] <Solidnick18> sometimes they can track
[0:49:10] <+duichenko> cmon nanba we're fighting
[0:49:10] <Blank9> "CHOSEN ONE" "I'M COMING"
[0:49:10] <leith_aziz> In EVERY playthrough I've seen, Nanba stays so far
[0:49:11] <srv4254> why always nanba tho
[0:49:11] <aluddss> if it gets real bad they tele
[0:49:16] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus don't be afraid to use abilities with nanba, his regular attacks gives him mp back
[0:49:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he was RUNNING to beat the crap out of that guy
[0:49:21] <dds333a> That's what they are
[0:49:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Head back in the parking garage, theres treasure inside!
[0:49:33] <twoto858> Venting out on the homeless
[0:49:33] <%CodenameChaz> Apparently if they absolutely can't figure out the pathfinding, it will just teleport them to the target
[0:49:36] <%cache_22> Computer show me Celery Men, wait...
[0:49:37] <%BisoromiBear> Bateman vs Ghost Dog
[0:49:40] <brachydios777> Now that was a trash hill
[0:49:42] <leith_aziz> I would just say J-Pops
[0:49:46] <%Interface23> Interface23 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:49:46] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Make sure to run away from a fight to see Ichiban's run animation
[0:49:47] <%Interface23> Interface23 gifted a Tier 1 sub to bevyrage! 
[0:49:47] <+RootVeggie> You’re homeless? I’ll kill you!
[0:49:57] <red_fox_zero> Far right corner of the parking garage.
[0:50:03] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus I mean, the trope of "teens beating the fuck out of homeless people" is more common in anime/manga than you'd think...
[0:50:04] <urkleturtle> "fuck the homeless, we're gonna attack them" is actually a problem in japan
[0:50:08] <dds333a> That's what was mentioned earlier
[0:50:12] <Jalexster> The game wants you to go to Hello Work
[0:50:16] <NotHereToStream> also yokohama is huge in this game

[1:01:38] <Jalexster> If Ichiban dies, it's game over

[1:03:04] <PsychoPearl> map may have substories if you're interested

[1:04:11] <TheMoenia> yokohama is giant compared to kamurocho
[1:04:12] <Darren716> It's best to stay on the bottom part of the map
[1:04:12] <PsychoPearl> Too high level here
[1:04:13] <LunarRemix> That's a nice idea for a spin-off. Just drop demons and make it a SMT game

[1:06:51] <+karldeck> use taxi or suffer later
[1:06:52] <PsychoPearl> Too broke
[1:06:53] <dds333a> 60k
[1:06:54] <@Menitta> I have concluded looking for a job and now I shall watch the homeless people
[1:06:57] <joyfulbastion> Essence of hobo.
[1:06:57] <%bPlusPlus> you don't even have a bed
[1:06:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @skyentombment
[1:06:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kimchi is my side hustle
[1:06:59] <Darren716> Please the taxis
[1:07:05] <%faeron93> I kinda wish they read
[1:07:05] <leith_aziz> DMNA
[1:07:06] <%BestTeaMaker> talk to taxi to unlock fast travel points
[1:07:12] <Darren716> Talk to all of them though
[1:07:12] <Blank9> Talking still unlocks them
[1:07:12] <+karldeck> You need to create fast travel point
[1:07:12] <PE4X> always talk to a taxi
[1:07:12] <+spardanwarrior> Stars above minimap tell you area difficulty
[1:07:13] <+Stormiercashew> you should unlock the taxis by talking to them,
[1:07:14] <Jalexster> You can
[1:07:15] <brachydios777> Woolie missing the 80s right now
[1:07:15] <leith_aziz> DAMN, even taxi's are expesnive
[1:07:16] <+AngelYoumou> NGL, touching every taxi is a good idea
[1:07:17] <+Chronobot> Hobo Arc is strong
[1:07:18] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus interact with taxis to unlock them as locations
[1:07:19] <pineapplepervert> You need to use them to unlock waypoints
[1:07:19] <CappuccinoGuil> You need to talk to them to unlock
[1:07:21] <fIashman92> You can only travel to taxis you have talked to
[1:07:21] <%Stormzcales_Lair> TALK to them to unlock
[1:07:21] <Komayeda> If you talk to a taxi you open it up as a warp point
[1:07:21] <%patriotrenegade> talk to taxis to unlock them
[1:07:22] <PsychoPearl> You have to interact with taxis
[1:07:22] <leith_aziz> This is so different
[1:07:23] <%cache_22> You can only travel to taxis you have talked to beforehand.
[1:07:23] <+Stormiercashew> you can only go to taxis youve talked to
[1:07:23] <Lunatyr64> you just gotta talk to them to unlock
[1:07:23] <skyentombment> Don't let Woolie see the Vergil ass coat there
[1:07:24] <+paladinstarbuster> You have to talk to unlock
[1:07:26] <%FlyingRamen> i think you have to interact with taxi locations to unlock
[1:07:27] <$QueequegTheater> Take the taxi the fuck out of Koreatown
[1:07:27] <leith_aziz> I kinda like that
[1:07:28] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus You gotta talk to taxis at least once to unlock them on the map
[1:07:29] <@Menitta> Oh yeah you gotta unlock the taxis as you play. You touch a taxi and then you can use it
[1:07:29] <Drunkengen> you need to unlock travel points
[1:07:30] <%invader_rin> Unlock every taxi you come across by interacting
[1:07:34] <downwiththethickness99> Its not chance based, If theres something behind the character in a certain space. Dont listen to the idiots who say its chance based.

[1:08:54] <Solidnick18> i am at the highest level yes
[1:08:55] <SomeAsianDood> there's one section u have to hard grind for for sure
[1:08:57] <CappuccinoGuil> That's the threat of the zone you're in
[1:08:57] <leith_aziz> One section later YOU WILL end up grinding
[1:08:59] <majindusto> NO NEED TO GRIND enigmaKEK
[1:08:59] <%patriotrenegade> Pull a Pat
[1:09:00] <+Birdro> those level 13s were in a 2 threat zone
[1:09:01] <Darren716> It's based on district
[1:09:02] <exnuart> it only shows the current zone
[1:09:03] <Doctadaking> Literally what I’m doing right now. Grinding all jobs to 99. It’s been days
[1:09:04] <+AkronymCLT> Threat only shows the level for the sone you're currently in iirc
[1:09:06] <SomeAsianDood> chat knows what that is
[1:09:06] <@Solidus_113> threat 2 is lvl 13 enemies
[1:09:06] <dds333a> @cache_22 Although most of them don't REQUIRE it to at least finish , but it'll be there
[1:09:08] <DXLelouch24> Little V PS5s dont exist tho
[1:09:09] <+Birdro> Each district is a bit different
[1:09:12] <+king_of_beggars> Go back down that alley for a surprise, maybe, if it's there.
[1:09:14] <Drunkengen> You dont need to grind at all until wayyyyy later
[1:09:18] <+AnarchicAnimeFan51> I tried to buy a PS5 but Fedex...
[1:09:18] <%shad8snake> just wish my ps4 save could transfer to the ps5 one
[1:09:34] <Tardispardis> @pyjama_day yeah jobs are a pain to level up LUL
[1:09:41] <leith_aziz> Though honestly, there was a guy who kicked my ass way earlier cuz I was too underleveld
[1:09:45] <+Jack8274> And even grind isn't a grind since it's not fighting the same guys. It's just mandatory battles and is honestly fun
[1:09:49] <stormhawk9891> @shad8snake You can transfer saves

[1:28:33] <@Menitta> they're quiet
[1:28:34] <orochisdayoff> nat 20 for sure
[1:28:34] <ndcoten> i love that "come on, we're good here!" while a hundred arrows are in the pavement
[1:28:34] <%Afterman_> because you can retrieve them i think
[1:28:34] <+VidulaSaix> They're silent for one
[1:28:35] <+Fenris_Alexius> Crossbows are silent
[1:28:36] <%FlyingRamen> soundless?
[1:28:36] <NumbF4ke> Silent
[1:28:37] <Komayeda> Guns are *super* illegal in Japan
[1:28:37] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Koreans are descendants of elvenkind.
[1:28:37] <Deasmeister> Thanks haha
[1:28:37] <huskarl_zap> if you make the bolts
[1:28:38] <+shootbang_exe> "we're good here" he says while walking past the shitload of arrows on the ground

[1:28:39] <malbarrough> Heart of hero, brain of himbo LUL
[1:28:39] <+Jack8274> In Japan it's probably a lot easier to get
[1:28:42] <thunka10> "I should not have licked the arrow"
[1:28:45] <+rubeSandwich> probably easier and less conspicuous than guns
[1:28:46] <+Fenris_Alexius> you can also make your own bolts way easier

[1:28:55] <%Davos_Southway> @WoolieVersus Crossbows dont count as guns
[1:28:55] <penitentpendant> Nanba: "Poison! Poison! Poison!" Ichiban: "Dude, it didn't even hit you."
[1:28:56] <%runegod20> guns are hard to get in japan, they're quiet, more legal, probably easier ot make your own bolts than buying or making bullets
[1:28:56] <+traximus_s> quiet

[1:30:33] <thedudeinthered> YOU just know it was some small-time grunt who came up with the idea to steal their power, so when Ichiban made his point that it was a dumb idea everyone would just look at him judgingly
[1:30:39] <StebTheVee> You could always work at Arkham
[1:30:40] <Halospaz117> I mean, it IS 50 bucks

[1:31:22] <meatman_noplan> Oh sweet, I'm in time for a Yakuza stream.
[1:31:24] <solracc25> Soapy Ichi to clean
[1:31:24] <thunka10> ...
[1:31:25] <Sulfur_Boride> G's and K's are sorta interchangeable for romanized Korean from what I've seen. It's a K sound, for the most part.
[1:31:29] <leith_aziz> I always called him Ichi first
[1:31:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Soapy Ichi
[1:31:36] <dukenux> Soapy Ichi

[1:32:08] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Later in the game a merchant will sell gold keys
[1:32:09] <solracc25> ALL
[1:32:10] <%Puhff> So is Ichiban not a real name?
[1:32:16] <Jalexster> ALL Silver Safes are now free, but you'll need to buy a key for each Gold Safe
[1:32:16] <+mars_driver> And temporary stat boosts, too
[1:32:17] <%NorthGrizzly> ALSO TABLE TALK
[1:32:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> SILVERS RESPAWN
[1:32:21] <MagumaDono> Someone for the love of god tell Woolie about foreman class when the time comes
[1:32:24] <%awpickens> @Puhff Ichiban translates to number 1.
[1:32:25] <+AngelYoumou> @Puhff It is, it's just silly
[1:32:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @Puhff it is, it's just a funny odd name
[1:32:27] <Sulfur_Boride> @Puhff "Ichiban" is literally the common term for "Number 1" in Japanese
[1:32:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:32:29] <$QueequegTheater> @Puhff It's his real name but it literally means "Number One"
[1:32:29] <leith_aziz> @QueequegTheater How do I find him ?
[1:32:30] <halfmasks> @Puhff Its naming your kid "The Best"
[1:32:32] <%Superdandy96> I wished that worked in real life
[1:32:38] <penitentpendant> It's a little expensive for you at the moment
[1:32:39] <solracc25> Spend that Stimmy
[1:32:43] <%Afterman_> time to get drunnnk
[1:32:53] <%Superdandy96> Gained EXP after dining some spicy pork ramen? Yum
[1:32:53] <+AugustRei> when you have the money you should order everything,it will show you all the combos
[1:32:53] <%doomerskeletor13> hollytonesUie
[1:32:56] <disflipmat> Spend that Stimmy on some Hibiki
[1:32:59] <%runegod20> the descrfiption also gives a hint of the combos
[1:33:00] <%jonblnt> big spender Little V
[1:33:02] <%shad8snake> spend all that money
[1:33:03] <MagumaDono> Lmaooo spend the stimmy
[1:33:08] <%runegod20> but you could just eat everything if you want
[1:33:10] <$QueequegTheater> @leith_aziz Backalley merchant hidden behind a fake wall in Chinatown (give Ichiban the Foreman job and he can knock them down)
[1:33:12] <orochisdayoff> ohh curry looks nice
[1:33:16] <thefabianstrategy> My name is Batman bin Suparman
[1:33:17] <samazam94> its like having Courage as your first name. its not that its nkt real, its just... weird
[1:33:20] <dds333a> Nice accurate Hakushu
[1:33:25] <linSP> BIDEN BUCKS
[1:33:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Get them some food, poor guys deserve a good meal
[1:33:27] <%PapaGravestone> play ichiban like hes keto Kappa
[1:33:27] <%runegod20> i still don't get what pasta sticks are, but they look good
[1:33:28] <grouchio> Yeah you
[1:33:28] <+RootVeggie> Just give back the money they just gave you
[1:33:29] <+Birdro> If you take recommended meal it's a guaranteed resource top off, good reasons to pick meals too though
[1:33:31] <leith_aziz> So, cobos didnt work till I reached a certain part in the story
[1:33:32] <+AugustRei> don't do recommended
[1:33:33] <moonmintparadise> is that a monster hunter like menu set ???
[1:33:34] <leith_aziz> Combos
[1:33:37] <+Hacerous> c-c-c-COMBO
[1:33:38] <%Superdandy96> Ah so Ichi got his Biden bucks too
[1:33:38] <+AugustRei> way too expensively
[1:33:43] <$QueequegTheater> Yes
[1:33:43] <Solidnick18> you get a little buff
[1:33:44] <+Proxzo> Did they take pictures of real foods? Or are those CG?
[1:33:44] <+nabs2099> @thefabianstrategy Batman son of Superman?
[1:33:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> make it a meal
[1:33:45] <+AngelYoumou> Sometimes it's Two items
[1:33:45] <Sulfur_Boride> Too expensive
[1:33:46] <+rubeSandwich> you start this game so poor and by the end you can purchase satelites
[1:33:46] <+Jack8274> Usually it's an app, a main, and a drink
[1:33:46] <twoto858> Yes
[1:33:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Malt and Edamame?
[1:33:51] <%bPlusPlus> your too broke for this please
[1:33:52] <%runegod20> yeah, all at the same time, and it has to be the right combo
[1:33:52] <hassanico2> Fried pasta?!
[1:33:53] <pi_in_the_sci> not always three, sometimes two
[1:33:55] <brachydios777> Curry is technically a western food to the Japanese because it was brought by the British at the time, right?
[1:33:58] <$QueequegTheater> You can buy a lot at once
[1:33:58] <Blank9> combos are hidden, best way to find them is eating everything at once
[1:34:00] <Sulfur_Boride> It has to be specific items in a combo
[1:34:00] <red_fox_zero> You get unique dialogue if you do the right combo, too.
[1:34:02] <leith_aziz> @QueequegTheater huh. I probably wont remember that, but thanks for telling me
[1:34:03] <Hopit> You can buy everything there is and it unlocks all the combos
[1:34:08] <dds333a> @hassanico2 is delicious
[1:34:10] <+Schrodingers_Box> You can buy all
[1:34:13] <+king_of_beggars> If you buy everything on the menu it autofills all the menu sets. Not useful now, but info for later.
[1:34:22] <thefabianstrategy> Jesus typing on a smart TV is sloooooooooow
[1:34:23] <+Schrodingers_Box> You can buy more than 3 items at a time
[1:34:24] <+0neReeler> doesn't show, gacha mechanics
[1:34:24] <+NopeBadguy> ITADAKIMASU
[1:34:26] <HollowMan190> tasty
[1:34:26] <hassanico2> Itadakimaaaas
[1:34:26] <%Puhff> ME
[1:34:29] <leith_aziz> So combos didnt work for me till I reached a certrain part in the story
[1:34:30] <CappuccinoGuil> He's poor, chat LUL
[1:34:31] <disflipmat> okay that is hilarious with just one party member
[1:34:31] <%notsoy> only specific combos give the bonus effect
[1:34:37] <dds333a> OISHII
[1:34:43] <leith_aziz> Man, you can tell Nanba hasnt eaten much
[1:34:46] <Darren716> Yeah you need to order specific food
[1:34:47] <%runegod20> we probably only have another session at most after this one, if we get anymore at all
[1:34:47] <$QueequegTheater> @leith_aziz there are very few false walls in the over world, you can look them up on a guide easily
[1:34:47] <Solidnick18> i just bought them all at once
[1:34:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUY ALL TO FIGURE THEM OUT
[1:34:49] <Maleicus> no
[1:34:51] <Doctadaking> Kinda awkward with just one guy, huh
[1:34:52] <penitentpendant> Sets give you bonuses in future fights.
[1:34:53] <+RootVeggie> So tasty!
[1:34:53] <KShirahama> combos a normally side + main + drink
[1:34:57] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Buy them all at once
[1:34:59] <%NorthGrizzly> no
[1:35:00] <+Williamld> Reccomendation is never the buff
[1:35:00] <Jalexster> You're at full HP/MP
[1:35:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeneralSCPatton he literally can't afford everything
[1:35:01] <+Schrodingers_Box> BUY EVERYTHING
[1:35:02] <%FlyingRamen> just be rich and order one of everything
[1:35:04] <$QueequegTheater> The whole menu
[1:35:05] <+Birdro> Recommended will not trigger combo sets
[1:35:05] <majindusto> Nope
[1:35:05] <Darren716> Guys it doesnt matter, just buy everything once you have money
[1:35:06] <leith_aziz> Recommendation dont it seems
[1:35:06] <+AugustRei> I dont think thats it
[1:35:11] <disflipmat> Woolie once you start getting money, just buy the entire menu and it'll unlock all the combos
[1:35:14] <MagumaDono> When you have money just buy the whole menu
[1:35:14] <%NorthGrizzly> Just move on
[1:35:15] <%shad8snake> youll have enough money to buy the whole menu later
[1:35:16] <%BestTeaMaker> recommendations aren't a set bonus
[1:35:19] <Jalexster> Honestly, you can wait until you're drowning in yen later in the game before doing this
[1:35:20] <Blank9> never think of it until you can buy the whole menu
[1:35:21] <penitentpendant> Recommendations give you no buffs, just 'heal you to full'
[1:35:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cappuccinoguil Doesn't matter. That's the later strat.
[1:35:22] <$QueequegTheater> OH BOY WAS THERE
[1:35:23] <KillMyPast> Time for some VF?
[1:35:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @majindusto
[1:35:24] <%BestTeaMaker> they're just an instant food option
[1:35:29] <%runegod20> we probably won't play the game long enough to get to the point where we could just buy everything at once
[1:35:29] <+TheDrugWeCallWifi> I love Ichiban's shit-eating grin in the bottom right
[1:35:34] <Tuna_Can_0> TTours
[1:35:35] <+ForrestofFallenTrees> Some of the combos don't make sense so eventually just literally buy everything at once to find them all at once
[1:35:37] <red_fox_zero> Once hou have more money just buy everything at once every time you go to a restaurant.
[1:35:43] <@Menitta> I wish you could ride the Ferris wheel
[1:35:43] <%jonblnt> super runaway
[1:35:44] <red_fox_zero> *you
[1:35:48] <dds333a> NANDE?
[1:35:49] <+metzselaar> Selfie!
[1:35:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeneralSCPatton chat is yelling "buy everything" when he literally can't at the moment, let's chill with that. He'll get there eventually.
[1:35:50] <$QueequegTheater> It does not
[1:35:50] <%BestTeaMaker> it's based on area
[1:35:51] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[1:35:54] <dead_harmony13> nah they are around level 10
[1:35:56] <%BestTeaMaker> and yeah it'll change
[1:35:56] <revoltingimp> I've been there!
[1:36:03] <MagumaDono> The threat level adjusts on zones and you
[1:36:06] <%shad8snake> itll adjust
[1:36:09] <%runegod20> if you run back to the hobo park it's go back to 1 star
[1:36:11] <xpakeo> threat level of the area
[1:36:12] <+Chronobot> hobo arc
[1:36:14] <+RootVeggie> Tourist? I’ll kill you!
[1:36:17] <Drunkengen> It changes when you get to later chapters
[1:36:22] <$QueequegTheater> OH NO
[1:36:25] <Jalexster> You're still VERY early game

[1:55:06] <fIashman92> Different class
[1:55:07] <PsychoPearl> Can't use the bat just yet
[1:55:09] <Sulfur_Boride> @WoolieVersus Bat's for a job you haven't unlocked yet
[1:55:10] <+mars_driver> @WoolieVersus Need different jobs to equip that.
[1:55:13] <+ChubbyPencil> I'm not a car but but man I can watch Regular Car Reviews for hours

[1:55:35] <RICE02> The V Mobile from the dMc Series
[1:55:36] <mortificent> and old Jaguar is so cool
[1:55:37] <razgrizsilver> Huh, wouldn’t have thought woolie doesn’t do car stylin
[1:55:38] <%X2Eliah> Cars 100% look all the same now
[1:55:38] <Drunkengen> I watch alot of Top Gear but i dont care too much about cars
[1:55:40] <%bPlusPlus> vintage car also terrible efficiency
[1:55:44] <%DkLordG> I'll take whatever drives, but I would love a Thunderbird
[1:55:44] <dds333a> Yeahz the old flatbeds
[1:55:49] <%Jiggisnipe> well everyone is copying each other so they'll all look similar
[1:55:49] <BlackermanZX> LOL
[1:55:51] <%NorthGrizzly> You can equip it LATER after the next story mission
[1:55:52] <+ChubbyPencil> Honda Beat tho
[1:55:53] <solracc25> Isekai trucks?
[1:55:53] <+king_of_beggars> Go ahead with the story just a little more so you can unlock job changes.
[1:55:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> sso same thing Kappa
[1:55:54] <ghoststalker> Japan has small boxy trucks they call kei cars
[1:55:55] <dds333a> We had them in DR
[1:55:57] <KShirahama> they look similar because safety requiments
[1:55:59] <%threeheadedwalrus> Aerodynamics and safety are limiting
[1:56:01] <GlaceonYo> Equip bat?
[1:56:03] <Jalexster> You cannot equip the bat
[1:56:05] <+johnnychopsocky> I liked my old Kia Soul.  Was easy to spot in a crowded parking lot
[1:56:07] <%Zeif00> mystery machine?
[1:56:07] <CappuccinoGuil> @GlaceonYo can't
[1:56:07] <%dreadedcthulhu> also probably has a sick wizard airbrushed on the side
[1:56:09] <halfmasks> its cause new cars actual need to be aerodynamic and economic too, so they tend to be the same profile
[1:56:11] <GlaceonYo> ah
[1:56:12] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Bat is job specific
[1:56:17] <penitentpendant> You need the class associated with it
[1:56:19] <Huntercd> Like the Mystery Machine?
[1:56:20] <%Javaa01> Weapon types are job specifc
[1:56:21] <CappuccinoGuil> You should DEFINITELY do all the sidequests now
[1:56:21] <PsychoPearl> The other substory?
[1:56:21] <@Solidus_113> Everything becomes honda civic
[1:56:21] <red_fox_zero> Bat is a style.
[1:56:22] <Darren716> Sub story down south
[1:56:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah you need to progress a bit

[1:56:26] <%Javaa01> You currently don't have a job

[1:56:38] <BlackermanZX> man i love this theme
[1:56:40] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus All weapons are locked to their respective jobs (classes)
[1:56:41] <Doctadaking> Just like Shinada...
[1:56:41] <+ChubbyPencil> Car safety ratings destroyed cool car designs
[1:56:46] <%bPlusPlus> corollas still look like shit

[2:29:04] <Tardispardis> The plot in Judgment really digs into this bullshit
[2:29:10] <DatAsuna> ACAB
[2:29:19] <+nabs2099> ACAB
[2:29:19] <%X2Eliah> Ichi...
[2:29:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> AJCAB
[2:29:24] <kifflomdolphin> @ghoststalker I believe that wholeheartedly. But, as another Adachi said, it's against criminal procedure code.
[2:29:24] <ghoststalker> @leith_aziz oh, you have no idea. If the Japanese cops want you, they’ll hold you until they can get you
[2:29:26] <%BestTeaMaker> ichiban, that's what happened to you

[2:29:40] <+the22cstomp> @paladinstarbuster keyword was
[2:29:41] <Tennochief> what part of, "I'm a cop who's trying to help people" do you not understand?
[2:29:42] <+nabs2099> Adachi is not a cop anymore
[2:29:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ACEAAB = All Cops Except Adachi
[2:29:45] <+nabs2099> ACAB
[2:29:46] <+paladinstarbuster> so is tanimura
[2:29:48] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @paladinstarbuster not a cop anymore
[2:29:51] <penitentpendant> So the cops 'Epsteined' the guy so he wouldn't spill the truth
[2:29:59] <AhmCha> The reason we say ACAB is because Adachi was a good cop and his reward was being fired from being a cop
[2:30:00] <penitentpendant> Rough
[2:30:03] <Meltgar> Cops doing a bad thing? What are the odds Kappa
[2:30:06] <+paladinstarbuster> and DATE
[2:30:06] <kifflomdolphin> So, is Adachi-san just Japanese Breaking Bad Mike?
[2:30:06] <%jonblnt> Adachi is just an old shounen protagonist
[2:30:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Epstein did not commit the die

[2:44:29] <%FlyingRamen> weapons can br upgraded so I would hold onto it for later
[2:44:30] <OverlordLuna> not motivated
[2:44:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> you cant sell the bat
[2:44:32] <Aeon_Offspring> never sell weapon
[2:44:32] <%asgard147> Do not sell that bat woolie
[2:44:35] <mortificent> don't sell weapons
[2:44:37] <supakaminarikun> Red is GOOD, Blue is BAD!!
[2:44:38] <%dreadedcthulhu> pokemon does a similar thing with natures
[2:44:38] <%BusterRepukken> Keep beginner bat.
[2:44:38] <Blank9> it's like X/O on playstation controllers, X is no and blue, O is yes and red
[2:44:39] <+Hacerous> Dilf hunter
[2:44:40] <Iwashi94> Red Circle -> Good | Blue X -> bad
[2:44:41] <pineapplepervert> RED PILL VS BLUE PILL

[2:44:45] <+cubbywolf> oh I guess alot
[2:44:46] <+BlackMageMog> I look at it is Red= turning up the heat and blue = cooling down
[2:44:47] <%r0chelimit> Do NOT SELL THAT WEAPON

[2:44:56] <%BusterRepukken> do not sell beginner bat whatever you do
[2:44:57] <%runegod20> i think more that they look for older guys since they assume they have money since they've been working for years
[2:44:59] <red_fox_zero> Keep that Hero Bat forever.
[2:45:01] <+Diredoe> I think it's more people who beat up older guys because theoretically older = wealthier
[2:45:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> No you cannot

[2:56:09] <+Birdro> you can turn those off if you care to, It averages out to slightly weaker though
[2:56:11] <penitentpendant> The weirdest thing is Adachi is still listed as "Detective"

[4:06:53] <eldragon_1> "The devil you know", basically
[4:06:54] <Komayeda> Okay, so I think his argument is "this guy is bad, but he could be a *lot* worse."

[4:07:23] <%0neReeler> ichiban the hero
[4:07:25] <justcallmebobplease> Ichiban grew up in a soapland raised by both the girls and the guy running it - of course he's biased in their favor.

[4:07:28] <+VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I 100% agree and I hate this plot point, but I try to keep in mind that in Ichi's head he was raised by people like this and has a hard time seeing the problem
[4:07:30] <OldManDeckardCain> the fact that woolie is more disturbed by this than wandavision is wild LUL
[4:07:30] <+LiquidSnakesArm> I cannot stress enough, you're jumping the gun.
[4:07:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god now i can't wait for him to get back to 0 for one quest
[4:07:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bleach Japan is Chat right now
[4:07:38] <+Liquid_Dio> It's almost as if this is a grey area... that should be bleached white
[4:07:39] <samazam94> guys stfu let him get there
[4:07:39] <%BusterRepukken> People really dont like being challenged i guess
[4:07:40] <librettodude> Gotta trust the narrative
[4:07:43] <+Jack8274> You have no idea LOL
[4:07:44] <+duichenko> lets ride it out tho

[4:07:49] <+rrratbastard> LETS RIDE IT OUT
[4:07:49] <+Mahbonk> not a good start LUL
[4:07:51] <rafflespaddock> grey area
[4:07:52] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Yakuza is always pro-employer even when it gets weird
[4:07:54] <deviljhojho_> lets see what happens
[4:07:56] <ghoststalker> Just ride it out bro
[4:08:00] <+Jack8274> I love seeing the initial reaction before it becomes Yakuza
[4:08:01] <Solidnick18> I LOVE ICHI
[4:08:02] <+Deko_> dont pee on the river v
[4:08:03] <Jalexster> Imagine trying to morally grandstand while playing a fucking Yakuza game LUL
[4:08:04] <skyentombment> @WoolieVersus Stop complaining, you're gonna get that Theme of Sad and you're gonna see how it's all ok!
[4:08:04] <%MAX116030> and now he wont get it for another 10 years
[4:08:04] <solracc25> It's Grey Zone
[4:08:04] <%jinking79> end on a good note doodLUL shinz0Dantess

[4:08:11] <$SirGO0SE> LUL
[4:08:13] <Drunkengen> THE CAGE
[4:08:13] <Solidnick18> how was that then
[4:08:13] <$QueequegTheater> Don't get hair stuck in it
[4:08:14] <+Stormiercashew> theme of soapy sad
[4:08:16] <+duichenko> the David Cage
[4:08:16] <Spagheddies> Consider the following: If the girl uses the soapland, she has the soapland's protection. If she bypasses the soapland, she loses the soapland's protection. Neither situation is good, but one is certainly the lesser of two evils.
[4:08:16] <deviljhojho_> hoo crikGnome
[4:08:18] <%itschickenscratch> a menacing piss
[4:08:19] <linSP> FIGHTING GOLD

[4:09:00] <solracc25> Remember Ichiban has seen all of this since he was a child.
[4:09:01] <thaprinnydood> being mad means its good writing
[4:09:02] <%Livelinne> AMBULANCE

[4:09:24] <laguerrilha> Easy chat, you have future info that Woolie doesnt have
[4:09:25] <deviljhojho_> morally gray
[4:09:25] <%ZweihanderSteve> WOOLIE AINT DUMB
[4:09:26] <Doctadaking> Remember, Ichiban is the dumb one. Everyone else in the game has their heads on straight
[4:09:26] <%Qualityhugeweeb> Weird sex stuff
[4:09:27] <Chester_goes_Berserk> @dexdestroyazz Yeah, from what I know it's pretty in tune with Japan's politics, very pro-free market
[4:09:28] <reonome> THIS IS A GREY AREA
[4:09:28] <Solidnick18> LUL
[4:09:30] <Tham1k> Oh hell yeah
[4:09:31] <+VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus I 100% agree and I hate this plot point, but I try to keep in mind that in Ichi's head he was raised by people like this and has a hard time seeing the problem.
[4:09:31] <majindusto> SIGH
[4:09:32] <+LiquidSnakesArm> @scwry You are with Bleach Japan, aren't you?
[4:09:33] <justianxix> LUL
[4:09:34] <+traximus_s> ichi is still cool. he just has some... views...
[4:09:34] <NotHereToStream> we'll get to that point woolie, just got to play more
[4:09:36] <DSD24> Let's talk Bleach
[4:09:36] <SolidusA> Hard questions LUL
[4:09:40] <%Livelinne> woolieYE_LH woolieKICKDAD_LH woolieMINHMAX_LH
[4:09:42] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie I actually know finance, THAT'S NOT HOW THE MINT WORKS
[4:09:42] <deviljhojho_> ichiban has some bagage
[4:09:42] <Louie_Salmon> THIS IS STILL WILD THOUGH
[4:09:46] <@Solidus_113> Himbo who grew up in that exact situation
[4:09:46] <Solidnick18> lmao
[4:09:46] <Ids560> Like I understand why ichiban has the perspective he has but the game agreeing with him is where I take issue
[4:09:47] <OverlordLuna> he's 5Head
[4:09:47] <turbofolk> He grew up in this places
[4:09:48] <+paladinstarbuster> Youre picking out the one guy
[4:09:49] <linSP> fuck bleach japan we stan scummy soapland man
[4:09:49] <RyuShinden> No Woolie, this is different LUL
[4:09:49] <%that__tj> Picked out a good chastity cage yet?
[4:09:49] <penitentpendant> I mean, it's nice that a game motivates discussion to a degree
[4:09:49] <DSD24> Well he has Wisdom though
[4:09:52] <+Jack8274> You need to remember, his literal Father was this guy.  His dad ran a soapland
[4:09:54] <+Deko_> big heart of gold
[4:09:55] <cellaccount> soaps got to clean
[4:09:58] <%s_xylocalsingles> @WoolieVersus yeah look at Pat, biggest Himbo
[4:10:01] <exnuart> he's a literal dumbass woolie
[4:10:02] <ghoststalker> Bleach Japan is worse
[4:10:02] <PsychoPearl> He grew up in a soapland he knows his shit!!
[4:10:02] <themememovement> He also grew up in a Soapland so he's kinda biased
[4:10:02] <+JustBlubs> Right!
[4:10:03] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @nabs2099
[4:10:04] <+scwry> @LiquidSnakesArm I respect sex workers unlike him Kappa
[4:10:08] <Blank9> I mean, Kronk worked for the villain the entirety of The Emperor's New Clothes.
[4:10:10] <turbofolk> @WoolieVersus Woolie He grew up in this shis Values are already off
[4:10:11] <%Afterman_> amogus
[4:10:12] <+colezone_> calm down woolie
[4:10:12] <MagumaDono> Lmao "Let's just justify morally bad things." We as the viewer can still disagree with how the game wants to spin it
[4:10:13] <Blank9> er, groove
[4:10:13] <+trialbyrespawn> he's grew up in a soap land
[4:10:14] <%PapaGravestone> but hes a himbo on the side of justice so soapland owner is an angel
[4:10:18] <Tham1k> Everything is gonna be fiiiine
[4:10:19] <CappuccinoGuil> I think they tried to go for a thing here and it DID NOT LAND
[4:10:20] <Torgue_1> It is, though
[4:10:22] <NotHereToStream> raised in a whorephanage
[4:10:23] <PrishKitla> this is also the worst of it, the moral of the game is pretty go from here
[4:10:24] <+paladinstarbuster> Ichiban grew up in a soapland he understands
[4:10:24] <fIashman92> Everyone reacts to this the same. Woolie's not alone
[4:10:25] <+LiquidSnakesArm> @scwry Just let the story play out.
[4:10:27] <+Jack8274> I think he sees Nonomiya as a father figure like his father
[4:10:27] <samazam94> ichiban is raised by a soapland owner. his pov is warped
[4:10:29] <@Solidus_113> His life is a soapland
[4:10:30] <deviljhojho_> It was a different time! 2019!
[4:10:31] <foxname96> is this it for today?
[4:10:31] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He grew up in a soapland so he's biased
[4:10:33] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus I'm willing to say Ichi has seen worse dudes than this scumbag. Also what's the better option you can offer in this situation. I dont see one that Ichi can offer.
[4:10:36] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus you're just gonna have to keep playing to figure out this point of view
[4:10:37] <+Mahbonk> a very weird cliffhanger to leave on LUL
[4:10:37] <%CodenameChaz> Like even his friends were like "Heeey Ichi, no"
[4:10:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> characters can also learn, Woolie. they aren't a mouthpiece. You already saw when he told the homeless just to get a job.
[4:10:38] <dexdestroyazz> @Chester_goes_Berserk yeahh, one of those topics that kind amakes you step back from the 'Japans soo great and wonderful' and realise that Ohhh its got issues, just like everywhere else.
[4:10:38] <%MAX116030> I have thoughts but Im not gonna talk here. Because Woolie can talk and I have text, Such themes discussions are not suited to talk here
[4:10:38] <GroundControl138> ichiban's father was in the same shoes as the scumbag, hence looking for justifications
[4:10:40] <+ForrestofFallenTrees> You literally related kume being a piece of shit to being a woman my dude then went off on someone else
[4:10:44] <RyuShinden> Ichiban literally grew up in a soapland, He knows.
[4:10:45] <justianxix> the lesser of two soaps Woolie THE LESSER OF TWO SOAPS
[4:10:45] <%big_laser_boss> I don’t get that feeling. It feels like he’s supposed to be smart here considering his upbringing
[4:10:49] <Spagheddies> TBH the owner is a wet-ass C-word. That said, I feel like the game's writers did not intend for him to come off like that. Not that it matters much.
[4:10:51] <disflipmat> Yeah, this whole part's pretty dumb and thankfully Nanba and Adachi call him out on it
[4:10:52] <majindusto> Woolie  beginning  to agree with Bleach Japan enigmaKEK
[4:10:52] <+LiquidSnakesArm> Woolie jumps the gun so fast though.
[4:10:55] <the_krypto_knight> The problem is more that it’s obvious that Ichi is speaking for the developers
[4:10:56] <+Mahbonk> my lips are sealed

[4:13:05] <%X2Eliah> Guys it's not that Ichi is defending this scumbag guy, it's that *the game* is casting nonomiya as a good guy despite him clearly doing sleazy-as-fuck shit
[4:13:06] <$QueequegTheater> Nagoshi
[4:13:06] <OblivionSword1> Nagoshi
[4:13:06] <Spagheddies> Nagoshi.
[4:13:08] <themememovement> nagoshi
[4:13:08] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:13:09] <Qsmash_> at the least, Ichiban is being optimistic assuming the guy isn't a scumbag
[4:13:09] <majindusto> Nagoshi
[4:13:12] <skyentombment> Can we get the theme of sad in the Very Special WoolieVs ep?
[4:13:13] <Tham1k> Baby face

[4:13:15] <deviljhojho_> society
[4:13:16] <%nintega010> now I gotta wait until next Wednesday
[4:13:21] <mdkcde> I can't wait
[4:13:22] <penitentpendant> Next emote might need to be "Chotto Matte"
[4:13:22] <+traximus_s> @numbf4ke yeah definitely
[4:13:23] <%aurasviel> Woolie VS morality
[4:13:25] <+IronChefWookie> bleach japan
[4:13:27] <+LiquidSnakesArm> We don't know what Nonomiya is about AT ALL yet
[4:13:30] <majindusto> Toshihiro Nagoshi
[4:13:31] <+Jack8274> Tokyo Godfathers
[4:13:34] <%Javaa01> @NumbF4ke His hair ain't quite gray enough yet, give him a game or two
[4:13:36] <Namillus> Kiryu: Gets shot, walks it off, Doesn't Kill a Hundred Guys. Ichiban: Gets shot, nearly dies, starts vividly hallucinating.
[4:13:37] <mdkcde> Nagoshi
[4:13:39] <+nabs2099> @liquidsnakesarm It's 50/50 rn and if you've played Yakuza you know a lot of people get theme of SAD who don't deserve it
[4:13:41] <syanplague> Well this can take a while how many streams of like a dragon left? it was 15 hours right?
[4:13:45] <CalciumTax> you don't bleach things that are already white
[4:13:47] <themememovement> People who fall between the cracks of society didn't get there by choice basically.
[4:13:51] <+BloodyBurney> the game is called The Whereabouts of Light and Darkness
[4:13:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:13:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Chat acting like a real Bleach Japan rn Kappa
[4:13:54] <CalciumTax> you bleach japan the gray areas
[4:13:56] <DSD24> Kume Stain after all
[4:14:01] <Sunstalker> Japanese Ben Shapiro can fuck off
[4:14:04] <@Solidus_113> next week might be the last one, if they get to a clearer stopping point
[4:14:05] <+LiquidSnakesArm> @nabs2099 I've played the game though. Just let it keep playing
[4:14:07] <+Mahbonk> fk u , Kume you stinky head LUL
[4:14:09] <mrdejesus34> Toshihiro Nagoshi. He grew up in poverty.
[4:14:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> most of them just want donations and to rile people up to exploit the believers
[4:14:10] <%BlueJoneleth> MY GRANDMA RAN A BROTHEL AND  I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT. XD
[4:14:20] <Doctadaking> Having a discussion isn’t wrong.
[4:14:21] <linSP> it’s GREY
[4:14:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Benji Genshiro
[4:14:24] <308caliber> yup it's not just black and white
[4:14:24] <laguerrilha> On one side you see girls that legit got a reason to be there, the other you seem assholes taking advantage of it
[4:14:24] <+nabs2099> @liquidsnakesarm Alright.
[4:14:25] <NotHereToStream> just solve it 4Head
[4:14:39] <+MajorCrasher> Just get a job!
[4:14:47] <+LiquidSnakesArm> I'm saying that they're jumping the gun and coming to a conclusion too fast.
[4:14:49] <+bonanzo> just legalize everything 4Head
[4:14:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just defeat SOCIETY 4Head
[4:14:53] <+ForrestofFallenTrees> Humans hate change and the longer things last the harder they  are to change
[4:14:54] <deviljhojho_> JUST 4Head
[4:14:54] <%Juriasu> woolieONEGUY is on the job, he will bring about world peace
[4:14:55] <%X2Eliah> Fun fact, real japanese yakuza are super involved in trafficking
[4:14:57] <gamewarden92> Just make everyone wear a cage!
[4:15:09] <+LiquidSnakesArm> Of course they are, @X2Eliah
[4:15:11] <+jinking79> lot of new Voice
[4:15:16] <CalciumTax> i'm down to a few months rent and looking for work still, i'll suck a dick.
[4:15:19] <+nabs2099> I just think we should all seize the means of (re)production bro. Fuck the middleman
[4:15:25] <shieldecho> Even the most basic "All you have to do is acknowledge that sex workers are people" is somehow hard for some people
[4:15:26] <terramagus> If you do X or Y hard enough, you too can scorch the earth
[4:15:28] <+traximus_s> but you don't have to treat the downtrodden like shit
[4:15:36] <Namillus> @nabs2099 phrasing
[4:15:39] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Yakuza 7 does this better than the other hot topics this time too, because instead of just the character you play as, you can have guys like Nanba and Adachi still really be like, I don't agree with this, but I will help you
[4:15:41] <+LiquidSnakesArm> Just get back to the game
[4:15:42] <thedudeinthered> We went through all this in KOtoR, come on chat...
[4:15:44] <Torgue_1> @nabs2099 Only if he pays up
[4:15:53] <jojomzo> mikochiMiko
[4:15:53] <syanplague> Yhea i been in some conversations about drug addiction and the person say to me "just lock them up and treat them"
[4:15:57] <colzack_> I think Ichiban is a great vehicle to tell a story about these subjects through considering his upbringing on the streets
[4:15:58] <+nabs2099> @namillus KappaHD

[4:18:01] <$QueequegTheater> @CalciumTax dub has George Takei
[4:18:09] <jorniev> You have not played enough yakuza to deny that
[4:18:10] <Doctadaking> It’s fine for substories. Not for main story
[4:18:11] <Namillus> Also those punches are just Kiryu's fists

[4:20:55] <%Stormzcales_Lair> if its a translation I like it. else naw
[4:20:55] <+JustBlubs> Love them. Don't always prefer them but I want to hear it.
[4:20:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it depends
[4:20:56] <DatAsuna> I always listen to both and option select the better one.
[4:20:56] <Blank9> Shit, YYH is a good english one.
[4:20:56] <Torgue_1> Covers of what?
[4:20:56] <$QueequegTheater> BIT BY BIT I'M FALLING UNDER YOUR SPELL
[4:20:59] <+nabs2099> English covers of OPs can be REALLY good tho
[4:21:00] <clloudberry> english covers of ops are mostly trash
[4:21:00] <Deasmeister> Sometimes
[4:21:02] <ghoststalker> In most cases, bad. Some are decent tho
[4:21:02] <%innawoodssage> they have a purpose
[4:21:03] <mrdejesus34> Yu Yu Hakusho's is great.
[4:21:03] <Tracazoid> I enjoy plenty of them, depends on the artist. Love most of Amalee's stuff.
[4:21:05] <reonome> hell yeah smile bomb is good
[4:21:05] <Safarihat> reel big fish ravelution is best
[4:21:06] <+twohitgood> No. Can't do English OP's.
[4:21:08] <DSD24> I prefer hearing all the dialogue in a language I understand
[4:21:08] <%shad8snake> theyre mostly bad
[4:21:09] <Ner234> Just like everything else: Some are good
[4:21:09] <passserby> sailor moon's english op slaps
[4:21:10] <exnuart> yuyu hakusho's OP in english is still a banger
[4:21:10] <+paladinstarbuster> yo jubyphonic
[4:21:11] <%jinking79> for Comedy maybe
[4:21:11] <laguerrilha> Some can be REALLY good
[4:21:13] <PanicSwytch> I agree
[4:21:14] <grouchio> One Piece Rap
[4:21:15] <majindusto> I am Perfectly with English  Covers
[4:21:16] <%PrishKitla> if done while it can be as good as the og song
[4:21:17] <mrdejesus34> As long as it isn't fuck Freckles.
[4:21:18] <Blank9> I like American DBZ opening theme better than japanese one.
[4:21:19] <jorniev> ITS BETTER IN SPANISH
[4:21:19] <clloudberry> Latin american dubs of ops are the shit though
[4:21:20] <CalciumTax> The english rap done by the whitest fucking dude in every japanese HYPE song makes me cringeeee
[4:21:21] <@Solidus_113> Oversoul vs 4Kids Shaman King OP
[4:21:21] <Prevot> I can only speak for brazilian versions, but I like most of them
[4:21:22] <%PrishKitla> well*
[4:21:22] <moonmintparadise> pokemon and sailor moon
[4:21:23] <Wahrow> Yuyu Hakusho's Smile Bomb in English is great
[4:21:24] <red_fox_zero> Noooooo most of the time.
[4:21:24] <+traximus_s> usually whatever I hear first
[4:21:26] <reonome> FIGHTING EVIL BY MOONLIGHT
[4:21:26] <OldManDeckardCain> GERMAN NARUTO OP
[4:21:27] <DemonDude656> x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy x2lag2Eyy
[4:21:27] <Klefth> Great Days in English is a mistake
[4:21:29] <+nabs2099> absolutely
[4:21:29] <Tham1k> As long as they don't change the whole song
[4:21:30] <solracc25> Some just butcher the english covers
[4:21:32] <majindusto> *Perfectly OK
[4:21:36] <Doctadaking> I like things when they’re good. Weird, I know
[4:21:37] <PsychoPearl> Sono chi no sadame. Joooooojoooo
[4:21:39] <thedudeinthered> I’m just thinking of the Rurouni Kenshin english OP and cringinf
[4:21:42] <%freystreams> listen to richie kotzen's Gundam covers, they are 10/10
[4:21:42] <%big_laser_boss> If it’s good then it’s really cool
[4:21:44] <Burningfajitas> First time tuning into a live stream, happy I could catch it. Long time listener first time caller. I'm on Yakuza 5 now and can't wait to get to 7 but I'm living it through you for now, thanks for the fun commentary W and V
[4:21:44] <neroforte177> yo shout outs to the girl Leeandlie
[4:21:47] <Blank9> Wild Arms 2's openings are way better in english than japanese too, instrumentals with muted trumpets in place of vocals.
[4:21:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Drunkengen
[4:21:51] <+nabs2099> @klefth The literal guys who sang the song in English disagree with yiu
[4:21:52] <nicversus> I will watch Dubs over subs most of the time, but english versions of OPs are rarely as good as the Japanese. One of the few examples IMO is the Yuyu Hakusho OP and EDs in English
[4:21:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Meanwhile I'm sitting here with my Brazilian OPs from the 90s and 2000s LUL
[4:21:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but V said Dub COVERS of the original OP
[4:21:58] <%Grimlockfly> Party500 have u tried new Dan hibiki?
[4:22:04] <laguerrilha> Yeah mentally you translate them in tone on your head
[4:22:04] <valriot> SASAAAGEYO, SASAAAAAGEYO
[4:22:05] <$QueequegTheater> BIT BY BIT I'M FALLING UNDER YOUR SPELL, YOUR SMILE IS ALL I NEED TO KNOW ALL WILL BE WELL

[4:22:16] <DemonDude656> DREAMIN DONT GIVE IT UP LUFFY
[4:22:19] <majindusto> SHE  IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR  MOON! Wooo!!!
[4:22:20] <Namillus> Yeah translating songs is even harder than just translating
[4:22:21] <+VidulaSaix> Oh yeah absolutely
[4:22:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> most Dub OPs are not covers
[4:22:26] <PsychoPearl> I usually prefer the original
[4:22:27] <Namillus> Meter and rhythm and rhyme
[4:22:29] <Safarihat> rave master's english op ravelution
[4:22:32] <%aurasviel> @queequegtheater COME ALONG WITH MEEEEE, HOLD MY HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND
[4:22:34] <%Qualityhugeweeb> @jorniev great days does too
[4:22:35] <+zzNamttamzz> Kingdom Hearts opening songs are better in English
[4:22:38] <%X2Eliah> You ain't listened to songs until you've heard the russian estrada covers
[4:22:44] <%jinking79> yeah i can only hear DB ost in Japanese
[4:22:44] <OverlordLuna> i'd probably hate covers of The HU
[4:22:45] <%MajkirM> Anime in the 90s had Fire versiones in Spanish in México. The translation/adaptation was excellent. I have not encountered that in English.
[4:22:46] <308caliber> LUL

[4:22:57] <solracc25> Sailor moon good
[4:22:57] <CalciumTax> @QueequegTheater I rarely get to watch Woolie streams, who is this on the show with woolie? <3
[4:22:59] <exnuart> @zzNamttamzz utada does both english and jp versions
[4:23:00] <+ForrestofFallenTrees> The spanish version of post malone's Rockstar in unusually better

[4:23:23] <Tracazoid> The Kazoo version Kappa No but really some Kazoo covers are awesome
[4:23:25] <+Nekros4442> Japanese Let It Go sounds wrong
[4:23:27] <Tardispardis> Gotta listen the nightcores
[4:23:36] <$QueequegTheater> Johnathan Young is fucking incredible
[4:23:42] <BlackermanZX> i search for piano versions StinkyGlitch
[4:23:42] <solracc25> Kingdom Hearts where the singer does both
[4:23:44] <+nabs2099> Jonathan young did good for JoJo stuff.
[4:23:46] <%big_laser_boss> That one made by two Tesla coils
[4:23:48] <OblivionSword1> Yeah Jonathan Young is SICK
[4:23:48] <Blank9> Burning Rangers english is hilarious
[4:24:00] <%X2Eliah> OH NO PIRACY
[4:24:09] <jorniev> DBZ OP IN SPANISH IS AMAZING
[4:24:15] <%ggbhtg> I've written a few English translated covers sajamMouse
[4:24:16] <%jinking79> he forgot the rest of part 4 lyrics but fuckit do it live
[4:24:17] <%Qualityhugeweeb> The Kingdom Hearts english lyrics are kinda dumb though
[4:24:19] <Tham1k> John Piracy!
[4:24:21] <+nabs2099> pirating friends is GOOD
[4:24:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> masaaki Endoh did a cover of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers that is sick

[4:24:29] <grouchio> @jorniev FUCK THAT
[4:24:31] <+TristonObv> Those arent the same. Music is an audio experience. Anime is an audio-visual medium, where the visuals are just as, if not more important
[4:24:32] <+loukemia83> Giving your friens a CD is not piracy MPAA fucks
[4:24:36] <thedudeinthered> Johnathan Young’s One Punch cover is a work of Gods
