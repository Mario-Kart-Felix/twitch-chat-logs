[0:37:43] <jarednotwithsubway> @TURBOSUPLEX3000 yeah, im pretty sure, but there is a point of no return
[0:37:49] <NaturalGear> *sculptor
[0:37:51] <+MagiKestral> sekijo is the name of the sculptor, meaning one armed monkey
[0:37:57] <+Javaa01> Sculptor, not not Solider
[0:38:01] <primaryfire> ah okay then it must be the fountainhead palace boss @JJnAJjohnson
[0:38:03] <$Mighty_observer> wait is Sekiros father actually named wolf or whatever?
[0:38:10] <+MagiKestral> not soldier, SCULPTOR
[0:38:12] <%hassanico1> No, Sekiro's dad is Owl
[0:38:15] <%hassanico1> Sekiro is Wolf
[0:38:16] <+Your_heals> Love the Jap voice acting, sounds authentic and makes me feel like a weeb. I hear people love both though
[0:38:19] <jarednotwithsubway> yeah that would make sense
[0:38:21] <$Mighty_observer> ah
[0:38:26] <Jackomaning> Sekiro is a nickname for Wolf
[0:38:31] <Kghaleon> Wish you could bring him into the final battle.
[0:38:36] <%ballsack2020> the 7 eleven kill special
[0:38:38] <spinalwizard> only one piece to carry
[0:38:41] <jarednotwithsubway> fucking SICK
[0:38:42] <Professor_Rakor> It's disrespectful to have your head roll before your lord
[0:38:43] <Zayasu> FeelsBadMan
[0:38:47] <NaturalGear> o7
[0:38:52] <%hassanico1> RIP dude
[0:38:54] <Afroperonista> FeelsBadMan
[0:38:55] <mybigmeech> Let's pose on the dying man for style
[0:38:57] <%hassanico1> INFINITE SUICIDE AW YEAHHH
[0:38:58] <+Pixel_Matt> roo7
[0:39:00] <tri3dgE027> Wasn't there suppose to be a manga to be released telling Kanbei the Undying's backstory?
[0:39:01] <+MagiKestral> if you die to the bite, you don't waste a rez. can be very useful
[0:39:03] <$Mighty_observer> the voice acting is great in both jap and eng. except Sekiro himself
[0:39:06] <jarednotwithsubway> just KILL YOURSELF
[0:39:09] <LTKonnor> rxtroSalute
[0:39:15] <Mythundare> reusable suicide pill
[0:39:19] <+Javaa01> Infinite Cyanide
[0:39:25] <%hassanico1> The biggest issue in JP voice is that the game has dubtitles, it does not match the dialogue
[0:39:29] <%Lion_kun> if you combine this with a jizo statue, you're invincible
[0:39:38] <%ballsack2020> DO IT
[0:39:40] <$Mighty_observer> the ultimate "YOU DIDNT WIN!"
[0:39:51] <%hassanico1> Hidden Tooth is very effective if you know you're going down
[0:40:02] <%hassanico1> Like, you have no more heals but have resurrects
[0:40:03] <primaryfire> The Final Act of Cowardice
[0:40:09] <Bailey__gaming> hidden tooth I'd useful
[0:40:10] <$Mighty_observer> ^
[0:40:15] <%Lion_kun> woolie needs to grind emblems
[0:40:16] <Afroperonista> OSFrog
[0:40:21] <jarednotwithsubway> @hassanico1 oh shit, for real? man i wish i could get a full translation
[0:40:25] <$Mighty_observer> you was a bitch till the end
[0:40:34] <$Mighty_observer> ... vageta
[0:40:41] <BabyNaBackbrace> Cherry Italian Ice Tooth!
[0:40:49] <spinalwizard> ONE piece to carry
[0:40:51] <%jinking79> they AoT them
[0:40:52] <Professor_Rakor> It's also just disrespectful to have your head roll before your lord.
[0:40:55] <%hassanico1> @JJnAJjohnson it's not much changes but it's just noticeable enough in how people address others. Wolf is much more curt in Japanese.
[0:40:57] <%gigacanuck> that sounds off, you can just present the head
[0:40:59] <primaryfire> that sounds pretty difficult
[0:41:06] <spinalwizard> I have also heard of this

[0:42:51] <$Mighty_observer> @rupansen well in Japan where it happens 24/7 to thousands of people... yeah. make leaderboards
[0:42:52] <+Your_heals> fcbGasm i still get so lost in the areas, idk why the areas in DS clicked so easily
[0:42:53] <primaryfire> remember every body of water now that you can swim
[0:43:13] <$Mighty_observer> @jjnajjohnson sbfpRage upset
[0:43:30] <BabyNaBackbrace> just glue my hands to my head so it doesn't roll after you cut it off
[0:43:36] <%hassanico1> Ashina Castle has a lake, the Dungeon has a lake, the Past Memory has a lake
[0:43:52] <$Mighty_observer> the lake has a lake
[0:43:52] <%ballsack2020> the path to enlightenment
[0:43:56] <primaryfire> there are a couple of underwater prayer beads
[0:44:03] <Blank9> Mibu Village has a big lake
[0:44:04] <%cubito42> @hawk_rush Thanks!
[0:44:05] <%Lion_kun> there's water at mibu village, water in the dungeon, water at hirata and water at the castle
[0:44:09] <%hassanico1> There's also a special friend in the Ashina castle lake
[0:44:13] <$Mighty_observer> the sky has a lake
[0:44:19] <%hassanico1> the dance?
[0:44:20] <%ballsack2020> the dance sux
[0:44:21] <jarednotwithsubway> fair
[0:44:23] <%hassanico1> oh, the move
[0:44:27] <Finakala> There's a lake at Mt Kongo too
[0:44:37] <seylumiue> Woolie has been thinking about it for so long
[0:44:41] <%Lion_kun> oh yeah you need tog et an item from that
[0:44:46] <$Mighty_observer> its snowing on Mt.fuji... also it has a lake
[0:44:55] <%ballsack2020> also the mask sux
[0:45:01] <jarednotwithsubway> scales also get a few high level upgrade materials
[0:45:16] <$Mighty_observer> alot of things in Sekiro suck
[0:45:24] <%Lion_kun> the mask is where you throw away your extra skill points
[0:45:43] <%hassanico1> also no breath meter, woohoo!

[0:46:15] <Luthwag> Cheer1000 Listen to the podcast all the time. Stoked to finally catch your stream.
[0:46:18] <Psyramics> there's enough scales to buy out everything in one run
[0:46:38] <$Mighty_observer> @jbaker009 it still says horizon chase
[0:46:54] <primaryfire> 10 times better than crystal lizards
[0:47:57] <Blank9> secretly this trains woolie for Monster Hunter Tri
[0:47:59] <%Lion_kun> they're not unlimited
[0:48:05] <jarednotwithsubway> @TURBOSUPLEX3000 make that an infinite amount better than crystal lizards or the balls of cancer in victorian souls
[0:48:15] <+whitfield2000> Jazzy circuit finals are happening rn. Just thought I would let you know.
[0:48:54] <NaturalGear> the combat art isn't great
[0:49:01] <$Mighty_observer> @whitacre1999 woolie doesn't play fighting games anymore
[0:49:27] <BabyNaBackbrace> flowing passage imturbed out to be one of my favorite arts
[0:49:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:42] <%gigacanuck> sick
[0:49:50] <DeathByPoke7> i liked floating passage but it falls off at the end game
[0:49:52] <tattleworm> it's great for applying status effects
[0:50:01] <%Lion_kun> good crowd control
[0:50:04] <NaturalGear> it's cool looking but it has very limited practical uses
[0:50:08] <jarednotwithsubway> double ichimonji is just TOO DAMN PRACTICAL
[0:50:20] <%galaxyswirl> its not that its bad, its that everything is worse than double ichimonji

[1:07:00] <%hassanico1> Also, that note is implying Dojun and Dosaku are one and the same, cause he keeps going in there to talk to someone, except there's no one in there.
[1:07:00] <+BubbaRands> Dojun or Doujin Kappa

[1:10:38] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Let me explain something to you Woolie: You're a monster
[1:10:39] <cobalt_phoenix_> is this the woolie equivalent of spiritng the monk?

[1:11:09] <%wesleyjhere> thatsmrj subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[1:11:10] <primaryfire> it ends in his master turning dojun and the person you sent into mad red-eyes

[1:11:34] <+BubbaRands> YUP Doujin Kappa
[1:11:44] <cobalt_phoenix_> does that make Dojun Doppio?
[1:11:54] <Kghaleon> No, he turns into a Red eyes mini-boss.

[1:36:14] <DatAsuna> Yeah a lot of the not-combat parts of sekiro suck ass
[1:36:19] <%wujak> @WoolieVersus but you lose xp when you die, so the levels kinda work as xp checkpoints

[1:36:23] <%SirGO0SE> @gigacanuck DID I STUTTER
[1:36:28] <%Lion_kun> given woolie's rust I expect him to spend 2 hours on gunfort alone
[1:36:33] <%RyuuAoi> Girls are watching??
[1:36:44] <worldbrand> honestly you probably wouldnt have that complaint if you were to be playing the game without stream/LP tax deaths
[1:36:49] <NaturalGear> eh, it's just that you need to grind if you want to unlock everything in a single run
[1:36:54] <+Caped_Eggy> There are places in the game you can farm skill points very quickly, of course if you have time
[1:36:56] <Hydrapissed> uh huh
[1:36:59] <%gigacanuck> Girls like to watch too woolieMIRIN

[1:37:22] <+TopTieramisu> if there is no dlc for sekiro, this is their first game since demon's souls to not have dlc, right?
[1:37:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> stop trying to make Blanka seem cool
[1:37:30] <+TopTieramisu> oh wait, there's deracine
[1:37:30] <+linSP> i prefer the inverted tree skill mechanic over the normal tree and i will vouch for it
[1:37:51] <worldbrand> god i would be so down for deracine DLC because i have no idea what to expect

[1:41:56] <%hassanico1> @WoolieVersus there was a lag for a moment, but it's better now

[1:43:14] <%Lion_kun> there's a side path that's a dead end you should clean up first
[1:43:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> No fall damage in this game?
[1:43:32] <%hassanico1> Very minimal
[1:43:37] <%hassanico1> And only for bigger falls
[1:43:41] <%SirGO0SE> apatLiz

[1:44:13] <Rixstarian> @fuqboislim They didn't want to really punish vertical exploration
[1:44:30] <bear_breaker20> i would live up there w my mountainfu :)

[1:49:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> outfucking played
[1:49:31] <Ghostars> Geeze... 10K dev kit... Makes me glad I work QA on PC for Relogic, I cant imagine having something THAT valuable at home.
[1:49:35] <+Zutrax> I honestly had more trouble with this guy than the final boss
[1:49:43] <wulfsbane_jolt> just got here what try is this?
[1:49:45] <+atin2000> oh shirafuji. you were so annoying
[1:49:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> first tru
[1:49:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> try
[1:50:00] <%RyuuAoi> Boy, does he do damage.
[1:50:00] <cobalt_phoenix_> wait how did that not stun
[1:50:12] <%Lion_kun> because this bitch has armor
[1:50:24] <LTKonnor> Clapped
[1:50:26] <NaturalGear> umbrella is really good for snake eyez
[1:50:28] <+FOGSHIE> Shirafuji is a chick, a chick with guns
[1:50:36] <Pillagius> I see what the problem here - Woolie keeps rolling snake eyes Kappa
[1:50:38] <wulfsbane_jolt> hoo boy, in foe a ride
[1:50:39] <%Blackjackal95> these guys are probably one of the most 'rhythm game" enemy types in the game
[1:50:40] <%hassanico1> yeah the Snake Eyes are ladies
[1:50:47] <+linSP> this game has two sniper wolves
[1:50:55] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:51:03] <%Lion_kun> subimaru is effective if you can proc the poison I think
[1:51:08] <%parag0nl0st> sup woolie
[1:51:10] <+Caltropical> how far into the game has he gotten?
[1:51:16] <%Lion_kun> also firecrackers
[1:51:18] <cobalt_phoenix_> yea i thought it stuns
[1:51:23] <%Lion_kun> this is all moot because woolie has no emblems
[1:51:24] <shotgang86> [B R I N G M E T O L I F E]
[1:51:27] <Ghostars> @WoolieVersus I know how you feel on QA stories, I got a ton of them from my work on Terraria, Literally staying up till 4 AM banging my head against a boss just to make sure it IS technically beatable. XD
[1:51:34] <%RyuuAoi> @buytoast Gunfort?
[1:51:42] <%Lion_kun> woolie has no choice but to get good
[1:51:46] <Cool_Guy45> did woolie say if he was gonna stream ace combat in the future? Or was it just a one off?
[1:51:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> 410 billion dead Shadows
[1:51:54] <+a_deadbeat> I personally think the umbrella makes the snake eyes way easier
[1:51:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> He already did
[1:52:04] <wulfsbane_jolt> only got past this by going in 100%
[1:52:12] <%Blackjackal95> @Buytoast killed corrupted monk in mibu and now he's doing the valley
[1:52:25] <+Caltropical> ah okay, neat
[1:52:32] <NaturalGear> umbrella is great especially if you unlocked the followup move
[1:52:33] <%RyuuAoi> @cool_guy45 That was a "Thursday Night Woolie Onesie"
[1:52:39] <shotgang86> Woolie should make a "tales from Q&A", which he invites people from Q&A and tell their stories
[1:52:42] <+Caltropical> monk is such a fun fight
[1:52:43] <cobalt_phoenix_> @Buytoast also he got the MORTIS blade
[1:52:45] <wulfsbane_jolt> deflect the kick and dodge in, the shot will miss
[1:52:56] <wulfsbane_jolt> so, so annoying
[1:53:37] <Cool_Guy45> @RyuuAoi gotcha, thanks
[1:53:51] <+PanicSwytch> I was so annoyed with the second snake eyes until I found out he can be stealth killed
[1:53:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:19] <%AngriestAngryArtist> hey chat does woolie have the jump on opponent move?
[1:54:19] <wulfsbane_jolt> she can?
[1:54:20] <%hassanico1> You can hold button for Umbrella, it's a shield more than a parry
[1:54:25] <%RyuuAoi> Less aggression with this one, Woolie. Find your openings. USE IT
[1:54:45] <%parag0nl0st> parag0nl0st subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:54:46] <wulfsbane_jolt> no, go in hard and perfect parry everything
[1:54:49] <cobalt_phoenix_> @wulfsbane_jolt both can actually
[1:54:53] <worldbrand> i got through the snake eyes pretty easy by going in and getting too close for them to shoot
[1:54:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> how do you deal with grabs again?
[1:55:04] <worldbrand> yump
[1:55:06] <+mararioch> You can deflect her grab if you time it right
[1:55:09] <+Caltropical> jump or run away from em
[1:55:12] <wulfsbane_jolt> @fuqboislim dodge
[1:55:14] <Shwepie> How does Woolie like snake ladies?
[1:55:24] <BabyNaBackbrace> grabs need to be avoided

[1:55:28] <Aydarkzero> gun gal PogChamp
[1:55:37] <worldbrand> I had a lot of success jumping out of their grabs personally
[1:55:54] <cobalt_phoenix_> honestly using the shield is a waste of emblems in most fights unitl you get the purple and red ones
[1:56:08] <deviljhojho_> hey its woolie
[1:56:10] <wulfsbane_jolt> @worldbrand I always get grabbed out of the air
[1:56:11] <%RyuuAoi> Wait....is it never not attacking/blocking??
[1:56:11] <Pillagius> @AngriestAngryArtist jump on the oponent move is an innate ability. Woolie dealt with other Snake Eyes some other way i guess.
[1:56:12] <+mararioch> Jumping is usually the way to go for grabs tho yeah
[1:56:14] <primaryfire> most of the time you can avoid sake eyes' grabs by jumping and stepping on their head
[1:56:35] <%AngriestAngryArtist> ah ok lol
[1:56:39] <primaryfire> many grabs can yank you out of the air tho
[1:56:40] <%RyuuAoi> THERE
[1:56:44] <worldbrand> basically what woolie just did there
[1:56:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> one bar down pog
[1:56:54] <%AngriestAngryArtist> because I usually jump on people when they flash that red kanji :P
[1:57:12] <worldbrand> that was a dope air parry
[1:57:15] <wulfsbane_jolt> I found success dodging INTO her shots
[1:57:15] <%hassanico1> almoooost
[1:57:20] <%Blackjackal95> @CobaltPhoenix27 Red umbrella was really useful for me at the end of the game >>

[1:57:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> REVIVE
[1:57:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> GET HER ASS
[1:57:43] <worldbrand> I agree, dodging towards the gun before/during shots was useful

[1:59:28] <%Blackjackal95> Bridges are fuckers in this game!
[2:01:21] <cobalt_phoenix_> thats a skill
[2:01:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:38] <%Lion_kun> it does insane posture damage too
[2:01:42] <primaryfire> you can followup attack after absorbing an attack if you have the skill
[2:01:46] <kaii_s_> hey
[2:01:49] <Almondite> The basic one will break against melee
[2:02:02] <NaturalGear> you can actually do the followup whenever

[2:02:39] <dan_g_v> so spooky
[2:02:45] <%RyuuAoi> Is it an Umburan Umbrella woolieSMUG ?
[2:02:51] <%gigacanuck> mines
[2:02:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> IM UP
[2:03:00] <%hassanico1> Noisemakers?
[2:03:06] <NaturalGear> it's like popping air wrappers
[2:03:11] <%jinking79> that was perfect
[2:03:11] <Almondite> If you like the Umbrella I suggest the fire upgrade for it.
[2:03:12] <cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus pressing the button does the equivalent of a regular deflect but with a bigger window. holding it turtles you up. on top of that, the X slash you do is from a skill, it can be done whether you press or hold the fan button
[2:03:34] <NaturalGear> @Almondite I second that
[2:03:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> combat rolls PogChamp
[2:04:05] <BabyNaBackbrace> It's smoldering twigs over little piles of gunpowder, for detecting infiltrators
[2:04:06] <%hassanico1> I fucking love these dumb tree trunk shotguns
[2:04:38] <%gigacanuck> go go go
[2:04:39] <%RyuuAoi> Look at this baitin ass muthafucka
[2:04:49] <cobalt_phoenix_> that's the fan's absorbed damage
[2:04:53] <Hydrapissed> ur shield
[2:05:15] <+mararioch> The smoke happens when the umbrella blicks enough damage
[2:05:17] <%RyuuAoi> Its 4:20 somewhere
[2:05:22] <+mararioch> *blocks
[2:05:23] <cobalt_phoenix_> I actually didn't know it stores the damage even if you fold it
[2:05:25] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus smoke shows your fan absorbed projectiles, makes its attack do more damage
[2:05:26] <Videogamer4> Fat roll
[2:05:32] <%gigacanuck> snake time?
[2:05:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> does it mean anything or is it cosmetic?
[2:05:40] <+mararioch> It means the next attack does more damage
[2:05:43] <%Lion_kun> woolie progressed at gun fort much faster than i imagined
[2:05:51] <+mararioch> with the umbrella
[2:05:53] <cobalt_phoenix_> @FuqBoiSlim it does extra damage when he uses the fan slash
[2:06:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> that's cool

[2:07:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Grindmaster Minh
[2:07:44] <%Lion_kun> the best place is sunken palance
[2:07:50] <%Lion_kun> but this is a good midgame spot
[2:07:53] <+Caped_Eggy> You can use blood smoke to confuse the other gun dude and clear the whole fort from begind
[2:07:54] <%Lion_kun> palace*
[2:07:59] <+linSP> these shotgun fellows rarely drop mercury
[2:08:06] <+Caped_Eggy> behind*
[2:08:10] <+PanicSwytch> Best place is during the siege
[2:08:13] <cobalt_phoenix_> best is the stretch where the ogre was but at the end of the game isn't it?
[2:08:14] <Videogamer4> HUGE QUEST STARTS NOW
[2:08:20] <%SirGO0SE> he takes it like a bitch
[2:08:48] <+mararioch> @cobaltphoenix27 ye
[2:08:48] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:08:58] <%hassanico1> Has Woolie talked to the other merchant about Salt?
[2:08:59] <+Caped_Eggy> WIth the 3 twin sword guys?
[2:09:00] <cobalt_phoenix_> how is he so low on emblems?
[2:09:22] <Almondite> Woolie has an itchy trigger finger?
[2:09:31] <cobalt_phoenix_> hm yea
[2:09:42] <Almondite> Like that time he killed that guy, and that other time he killed that guy
[2:10:03] <MatTrix77> Mahershala Ali is BLADE

[2:11:37] <+PanicSwytch> WTF I NEVER SEEN THEM HERE
[2:11:45] <Almondite> So he's getting the ingredients right now?
[2:11:53] <%hassanico1> 3rd one from Sunken Valley
[2:12:29] <+linSP> minh with the cheese
[2:12:31] <Pillagius> @PanicSwytch ghosts start appearing after the monk bossfight
[2:12:59] <%RyuuAoi> Oh THIS is farming
[2:13:00] <cobalt_phoenix_> @Pillagius it's after you do 2/3 of the main objectives
[2:13:02] <%hassanico1> probably shouldn't mash Spirit Emblems
[2:13:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> what's the lore on these ghosts
[2:13:21] <%hassanico1> ghosts appear when the sun is down
[2:13:25] <DeathByPoke7> poor ghosts
[2:13:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> spooky
[2:13:29] <%Lion_kun> for midgame
[2:13:40] <Almondite> I think they're more illusions or memories than real ghosts.Or some shit.
[2:13:42] <%hassanico1> defeating certain bosses makes time advance so it goes from midday to night
[2:13:48] <Pillagius> @CobaltPhoenix27 oooh. Well, usually I do first the monkeys then the monk, so I guess that's how I misunderstood the trigger for them.
[2:13:52] <cobalt_phoenix_> aw ye i like this fight
[2:13:52] <%hassanico1> GIRAFFE
[2:13:54] <+PanicSwytch> @pillagius ooh ok, I've only known of the ones that appear if u pick up the prayer beads at the depths tombs
[2:13:56] <%gigacanuck> BOSSSS
[2:13:57] <cobalt_phoenix_> @Pillagius understandable
[2:13:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> uhhhh
[2:14:04] <%hassanico1> LOOK AT THIS GIRAFFE
[2:14:06] <+Caped_Eggy> Easiest mini boss by far
[2:14:08] <DeathByPoke7> i hope woolie likes parries
[2:14:14] <Almondite> How many tiems before he figures it out, chat?

[2:14:32] <That_Mojo> doodCrazy
[2:14:34] <buerdo> Gunfort is super easy to stealth kill most people if you go through backwards
[2:14:40] <+PanicSwytch> Wolverine
[2:14:41] <RiceeFTW> REKT
[2:14:42] <+linSP> giraffes are pretty straightforward
[2:14:48] <+Caltropical> its so satisfying when you perfect the miniboss fight strats
[2:14:49] <%gigacanuck> what even is this creature
[2:14:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> these bloodborne ass wild slashes
[2:14:59] <NaturalGear> just mash L1
[2:15:02] <%hassanico1> it's clearly a wild african giraffe
[2:15:04] <%Lion_kun> he's super easy woolie
[2:15:10] <+PanicSwytch> Berserker Barrage
[2:15:11] <vVAstrAVv> cant believe he died to the easiest miniboss
[2:15:11] <%SirGO0SE> 5
[2:15:14] <%Lion_kun> he only has two mods of patetrns, the flurry and the sweep
[2:15:16] <Graxe_> Giraffe is a mistranslation, I heard. Like it's supposed to be Jirafu, but it could honestly be giraffe.
[2:15:23] <collind99> @woolieversus Mahershala Ali is Blade!
[2:15:28] <%gigacanuck> camera is not helping here
[2:15:38] <cobalt_phoenix_> don't hit
[2:15:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> rekt
[2:15:53] <Almondite> I heard it was meant to be kirin or something.
[2:15:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:53] <Hydrapissed> ???
[2:15:54] <%hassanico1> lol he got hit by every last attack
[2:15:56] <%gigacanuck> or instead of giraffe it's that one unicorn monster
[2:15:58] <cobalt_phoenix_> literally just parry, don't attack
[2:15:59] <%gigacanuck> Kiryu?
[2:16:01] <FALCONxPAWNCH> atpRtsd2 atpRtsd2
[2:16:13] <+PanicSwytch> Just parry, or use the umbrella
[2:16:30] <%RyuuAoi> Access the situation, Woolie
[2:16:35] <Almondite> And the centipede, as in, there's a centipede in him, peeing out form his back.
[2:16:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Just stop taking hits 4Head
[2:16:59] <RiceeFTW> free
[2:17:02] <%hassanico1> easy peasy

[2:17:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> He actually used the divekick PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:17:52] <cobalt_phoenix_> thank god he got this after he went to senpou

[2:25:39] <Almondite> You can jump at the centipedes to and execute them every time
[2:25:40] <satans_finest_millennial> just got back from the cottage. this is a best way to come back to internet!
[2:25:45] <%Lion_kun> okay time for some monkey business
[2:26:03] <+gantz_zero> do a shit while you sit
[2:26:28] <%Lion_kun> woolie has fallen in love with the umbrella
[2:26:36] <Almondite> Pretty much any mook type enemy that goes down in like two hits you can insta-kill by jumping at them.
[2:26:43] <%hassanico1> Fan flips people so you can backstab them
[2:26:54] <thepiefoot> Wind in the Korra game was pretty good...
[2:27:03] <+gantz_zero> just spoil everything man @hassanico1
[2:27:09] <thepiefoot> And Rudra from DMC3 is pretty good too
[2:27:19] <jeffishype> I can't believe Woolie supports Umbrella's Bio-Terrorism
[2:27:19] <SilverFaustX> woolie needs to check out all the new marvel news
[2:27:24] <DatAsuna> Yeah but fully chi-charged fire ebdnign was way better
[2:27:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> airbending was the most extreme crowd control I've ever seen in an action game
[2:27:31] <%hassanico1> DIVINE ABDUCTION
[2:27:31] <%gigacanuck> ah yes, Temari, one of the finer women from Naruto
[2:27:33] <SaltyAzteca> Tengu man I think
[2:27:37] <NaturalGear> it's one of the wierder abilities I can think of in any videogame
[2:27:46] <%gigacanuck> Shikamaru was a gentleman of supreme taste
[2:27:47] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:27:49] <+kralec> It's a Mario cape!
[2:27:54] <NiktenKing> The backdown
[2:27:57] <EySoyCoco> yeah wait until you see the upgrades
[2:27:59] <collind99> Those Marvel Phase 4 announcements are fucking sick
[2:28:10] <DatAsuna> Korra doesn't get enough credit for having a weirdly good parry system/dodge system and charge mechanic
[2:28:13] <NiktenKing> backdown from the backdown
[2:28:13] <thepiefoot> The best thing Temari ever did was put a ring on Shikamaru
[2:28:20] <DatAsuna> Things most other platinum games only focus on one of
[2:28:31] <bear_breaker20> @collindoucet99 preach what happun
[2:28:46] <collind99> @bear_breaker20 Mahershala Ali is BLADE
[2:28:47] <DeathByPoke7> sabimaru is your ninja way
[2:28:49] <EySoyCoco> @collindoucet99 googling as of now
[2:28:51] <thepiefoot> @DatAsuna I finished it the first time without buffing, it was hell
[2:28:52] <dan_g_v> some weapons make some enemies super easy, like the axe against shields. same for the fan
[2:29:00] <%SirGO0SE> BibleThump
[2:29:04] <bear_breaker20> eh
[2:29:17] <%gigacanuck> don't get distracted Woolie
[2:29:20] <bear_breaker20> good choice tho
[2:29:20] <DatAsuna> Charging your chi is a weirdly satisfying mechanic
[2:29:21] <%gigacanuck> get what you came for
[2:29:29] <NaturalGear> you do posture dmg
[2:29:32] <collind99> @bear_breaker20 also Fantastic Four And X-Men confirmed
[2:29:37] <DatAsuna> We were ROBBED of a full price korra game by platinum
[2:29:48] <DatAsuna> Imagine them throwing a bayo budget at red lotus
[2:29:48] <NaturalGear> basically
[2:29:49] <thepiefoot> Yeah yeah, i learnt it from the internet AFTER i had finished it LUL
[2:29:50] <cobalt_phoenix_> correct
[2:29:50] <%RyuuAoi> Auto parry?
[2:30:03] <collind99> And Natalie Portman as Lady Thor
[2:30:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> That game is a fucking trip on extreme and with the item that has makes chi charged up permanently but you take double damage
[2:30:07] <cobalt_phoenix_> not auto just less risky
[2:30:26] <DatAsuna> That and the super armor while charged item
[2:30:26] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:30:28] <Blank9> doesn't cost more emblems
[2:30:36] <thepiefoot> Korra got a lot of undeserved hate imo
[2:30:41] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:30:48] <Blank9> so long as you have the umbrella out and keep it out, it doesn't drain any more
[2:30:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> I never finished my extreme playthrough though because I got stuck on that one naga chase in the south pole
[2:30:50] <bear_breaker20> @collindoucet99 im so glad we nerds enabled corporate monopoly so mr fantastic can btfo dr doom again Kappa NotLikeThis
[2:30:51] <DatAsuna> I think part of it is it coming out right next to bayo 2
[2:31:04] <DatAsuna> Giant bomb's hate on it was explicitly because it wasn't as big as bayo 2
[2:31:39] <bear_breaker20> natalie portman aint buff tho wtf @collindoucet99
[2:31:48] <thepiefoot> Didn't Korra came out at half price? I didn't see the problem tbh
[2:31:50] <Almondite> Just git gud
[2:31:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> I got it on ps4 for like 5 bucks during a sale and i think i got more than my money's worth on that deal
[2:32:00] <dan_g_v> like the whole make your own bonefires concept
[2:32:02] <DatAsuna> Korra came out $15
[2:32:02] <Pillagius> Woolie, originally you had to make a medicine and bring to each NPC personally
[2:32:04] <DatAsuna> So like
[2:32:09] <DatAsuna> Slightly less than quarter price
[2:32:21] <DatAsuna> Transformers was $50
[2:32:22] <bear_breaker20> cancer patient sure she can do that, but shes no 'amazoness' lol @collindoucet99
[2:32:22] <cobalt_phoenix_> no only normal enemies, bosses and minibosses don't turn
[2:32:26] <Heissstt> dlc when
[2:32:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> its definitely an underrated platinum title
[2:32:38] <DatAsuna> I likd transformers, it's definitely proto-automata
[2:32:39] <Almondite> Praying Strike + is good as well.
[2:32:39] <thepiefoot> @bear_breaker20 IIRC she is still salty that Patty Jenkins ducked on her for Thor 2
[2:32:49] <DatAsuna> but the individual transformers felt undercooked for me
[2:33:01] <NaturalGear> equip the puppeteer ninjutsu Woolz
[2:33:07] <DatAsuna> I didn't like having 5 characters when each was "I'm the one that dodges"
[2:33:17] <DatAsuna> "I'm the one who dahses"
[2:33:59] <thepiefoot> @DatAsuna I completely skipped Devastation, i love platinum from keeping the character action sub genre alive but i don't i like their take on it
[2:34:03] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd1
[2:34:05] <%SirGO0SE> ASSMAN
[2:34:13] <LTKonnor> rxtroShy
[2:34:47] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, go to senpou and try the fan out on the enemies there
[2:34:49] <DatAsuna> I love platinum action but devastation is a bit too experiemental for me
[2:34:54] <%Skullgod> Skullgod subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hello Friends
[2:34:59] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Oh Minh... XD

[2:35:24] <%gigacanuck> snake now?
[2:35:25] <thepiefoot> I might sound crazy, but i thought that Bayo dragggged a lot it's final chapters. I just wasn't having fun with the combat
[2:35:33] <LTKonnor> Oh wait
[2:35:37] <LTKonnor> it's this place again
[2:35:39] <dan_g_v> deep
[2:35:44] <DatAsuna> Real talk

[2:35:55] <DatAsuna> but the ending to bayo 1?
[2:35:58] <%Skullgod> why didnt you parry him woolie
[2:35:59] <%SirGO0SE> apatBig OWLSHDg
[2:36:00] <NaturalGear> zettau ryouki
[2:36:00] <LTKonnor> rxtroL
[2:36:00] <DatAsuna> it actually sucks gameplaywise
[2:36:00] <Almondite> Let me show you my great white snake woolie crendorLurk
[2:36:03] <%Lion_kun> DIVE
[2:36:05] <DatAsuna> It's big hype presentation
[2:36:10] <DatAsuna> but the actual boss fight is slow
[2:36:12] <+Ilpala> get fucked
[2:36:15] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Prepare to clip!
[2:36:17] <DatAsuna> and has long phases of just waiting around
[2:36:20] <thepiefoot> The last boss is pretty hype but i thought it was as bad as Mundus lava fight
[2:36:21] <bear_breaker20> lmao just freezes like a deer in the headlights LUL
[2:36:25] <DatAsuna> Know what isn't hype?
[2:36:35] <DatAsuna> standing around for 30 seconds at a time
[2:36:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> loading screens?
[2:36:40] <NaturalGear> me LUL
[2:36:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh yeah that too
[2:36:45] <DatAsuna> like 7 times in one fight
[2:37:03] <DatAsuna> PS3 was awful about the load screens especially
[2:37:18] <%jinking79> your safe uderwater
[2:37:23] <DatAsuna> but yeah far too much of jubileas is "hit these feathers then wait"
[2:37:41] <+generalve> Did they see the MCU phse 4 announcements ?
[2:37:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:37:45] <thepiefoot> I bought Bayo on PS3 and was disgusted with the framerate. But 6 months after the PC version dropped and was finally able to play it all the way thru
[2:37:46] <dan_g_v> tickle it!
[2:38:09] <bear_breaker20> stab his belly from underwater PogChamp
[2:38:25] <%Lion_kun> Woolie at the next idol, go back to senpou temple and take the kite path to do something super awesome, it's super rad. Also try out your fan on some monks while you're there, you'll be surprised.
[2:38:31] <+generalve> yeah fuck you koi fish
[2:38:50] <SixthSun2> monkaS
[2:38:55] <Almondite> It's time
[2:38:59] <sphereshots12> Have people speed run this game yet
[2:39:06] <%gigacanuck> probably
[2:39:09] <+bubbli97> @sphereshots12 yes
[2:39:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe I'm just a button mashing scrub but I kinda like playing bayonetta more than other action games. i like how free? she feels in combat compared to like dmc
[2:39:14] <thepiefoot> @sphereshots12 Oh yeah, it's down to sub 1 hour
[2:39:18] <+bubbli97> Down to under half an hour
[2:39:19] <thepiefoot> All beads
[2:39:19] <+PanicSwytch> yeah it's been done at gdq
[2:39:21] <Almondite> Best area in the game
[2:39:23] <NaturalGear> @sphereshots12 under 30 mins
[2:39:24] <primaryfire> cant be Touched can't be Moved can't be Rocked can't be SHOOK
[2:39:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> like shes a lot faster
[2:39:29] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGASM
[2:39:39] <%steelmorrigan> Yeah the speed runs for this are nuts
[2:39:48] <%hassanico1> MONKEY BUSINESS
[2:39:52] <Graxe_> Aw yeah
[2:39:55] <Graxe_> We're here
[2:40:09] <DatAsuna> That's the huge movelist at work
[2:40:13] <thepiefoot> I like Sekiro Speedruns cause they aren't any major skips that i know of. It comes down to actual combat skill
[2:40:17] <%SirGO0SE> BELIEVE IT
[2:40:25] <+Ilpala> Woolie's super right
[2:40:30] <RiceeFTW> it is called Valley of the End, Woolie's a super Naruto nerd
[2:40:33] <DatAsuna> and even if they don't know about it, scrubs like dodge offset
[2:40:40] <%hassanico1> @WoolieVersus It's called the Final Valley sometimes
[2:40:41] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sbfpDattebayo
[2:40:42] <Zayasu> real naruto fan PogChamp
[2:40:44] <Graxe_> The monkeys got guns
[2:40:46] <%gigacanuck> is that a monkey?
[2:40:48] <CHVMPLOO> best boss
[2:40:50] <Parapattern> You mess with Grookey, you get the Bazookey
[2:40:51] <DatAsuna> Cause it's a forgiving mechanic that lets them continue their combos
[2:40:51] <%gigacanuck> IT'S GOT A GUN!
[2:40:54] <SixthSun2> This is the Valley of the Monkey Business
[2:40:55] <%DedlokPM> @gigacanuck yes it is
[2:40:56] <tattleworm> that monkey's got an ak47, watch out
[2:40:59] <RiceeFTW> woolie training to naruto run at area51 confirmed
[2:41:12] <DatAsuna> and by it's nature kinda comes hand in hand with more free form combos than DMCs more limited and specific ones
[2:41:21] <%DedlokPM> @gigacanuck also: IT'S GOT A GUN!
[2:41:30] <bear_breaker20> would you believe me if i said Animal Farm is just NaruSasu?
[2:41:37] <DatAsuna> That's kind of a problem that comes with having one melee button
[2:41:58] <DatAsuna> Ninja Gaiden, despite it's weird "so hard" rep is also quite noob friendly
[2:42:01] <NiktenKing> japanese macaques are creepy
[2:42:04] <%gigacanuck> @bear_breaker20 take your shitty opinions and get out of here
[2:42:21] <DatAsuna> Cause it's giant ass moveset allows noobs to mess up specific combos but still get a full one out by mashing
[2:42:26] <%Blackjackal95> at least there's no yetis
[2:42:49] <thepiefoot> Air deflect, very early ability
[2:42:52] <bear_breaker20> napolean and snowball fight for the farm at the end @gigacanuck LUL
[2:42:53] <+Dives__> 1% HP monkaS
[2:43:01] <DatAsuna> So I'd actually recommend ninja gaiden if you are fo the button mashing scrub variety
[2:43:20] <bear_breaker20> farm of the end*
[2:43:23] <%gigacanuck> I don't even know what you're talking about
[2:43:24] <%SirGO0SE> i think pat used it 1 time his whole playthrough
[2:43:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah I've never played NGB but whenever I look at gameplay I always remember how mobile ryu seems
[2:43:54] <%hassanico1> to scsrew over Taro @SirGO0SE
[2:44:03] <%gigacanuck> @DatAsuna I thought Ninja Gaiden was supposed to be really hard
[2:44:11] <bear_breaker20> @gigacanuck then read the book before saying the jokes bad??
[2:44:12] <thepiefoot> I watched Ninja Gaiden once, all i saw was backflips and charge attacks
[2:44:20] <DatAsuna> Ninja gaiden is like dark souls
[2:44:27] <DatAsuna> in that it's not actually super duper hard
[2:44:43] <DatAsuna> It just got that rep, and they were happy to lean into it for marketing/hype
[2:44:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:44:49] <RiceeFTW> the shinobi arts can all be used off a backstab
[2:44:50] <Almondite> Ninja Gaiden is Sekrio is Tenchu, is Dark Souls
[2:44:55] <DatAsuna> It's actually much more mash friendly than DMC
[2:45:08] <cobalt_phoenix_> or alternatively use a jumpover attack in combat
[2:45:22] <primaryfire> that's why there's an ability that let's you jump behind someone after their posture is broken
[2:45:29] <thepiefoot> NG also had to market on the difficulty cause the NES original were also known as really hard games
[2:45:29] <%gigacanuck> yeah but don't they start with guys on motorcycles trying to gun you down?
[2:45:30] <%hassanico1> They like Shiny things!
[2:45:34] <%Blackjackal95> NG 1 and 2 are pretty neat games though the world and enemy designs are obviously going to seem really generic compared to Souls
[2:45:36] <%SirGO0SE> secret monkey gold
[2:45:39] <RiceeFTW> yup that ability is od
[2:45:46] <%SirGO0SE> woolieMINHSTINCT
[2:45:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dmc actually has a lot of mashing, its just at specific times
[2:45:57] <DatAsuna> Nah they start with jobber ninjas that you can just hold block against and infinitely spam dodge
[2:46:08] <Almondite> Albino Poison Monley Samurai
[2:46:09] <%SirGO0SE> Minh ily and your wonderful hyuks
[2:46:13] <DatAsuna> or spam the jump/divekick move on without being punished
[2:46:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> crazy combos in 3 NotLikeThis
[2:46:17] <NanoHologuise> oh hey it's snake blighttown
[2:46:20] <%gigacanuck> dragon blood?
[2:46:24] <thepiefoot> @fruit_pie_the_magician I assume you are talking about "crazy combos" (million stabs) if so, you don't mash anymore. Just hold.
[2:46:35] <DatAsuna> And like I said, because of the way it's combos work
[2:46:36] <%hassanico1> Poison Gourd is not very useful right?
[2:46:41] <NanoHologuise> or monkey blighttown i suppose
[2:46:42] <MTLxSpider> r ya Winning
[2:46:44] <RiceeFTW> only in this area lul
[2:46:54] <DatAsuna> a buttton masher can just freak out and spam dodge or attacks and do a lot better than in dmc
[2:47:25] <DatAsuna> Like, the vita ports don't run at 30
[2:47:29] <DatAsuna> And that's a shame.
[2:47:32] <RiceeFTW> that's cursed
[2:47:33] <GalaxyCrusher> !uptime
[2:47:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 56 minutes
[2:47:37] <DatAsuna> But the game doesn't really demand 30
[2:47:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm actually talking about air cancelling and dmc3 style mashing to nhance swordmaster and so on
[2:47:59] <DatAsuna> So people tried NG for the first time on weird variable resolution and 20FPS and still did fine
[2:48:14] <thepiefoot> @fruit_pie_the_magician Oh yeah, luckily JC is the loosest it's ever been in DMC5. Back in the DMC3 days i didn't mash tho, i would just slide my thumb
[2:48:20] <DatAsuna> Cause it's not actually that exactnig
[2:48:24] <DianaTheAscian> i forgot this game fixed the souls soul problem by showing values
[2:49:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'd play dmc3 on turbo and wow that would jack up my wrist with agni and rudra
[2:49:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> every fromsoft game has to have a poison swamp huh
[2:49:17] <DatAsuna> by mashing i don't mean repeated presses
[2:49:27] <DatAsuna> by mashing I mean "I don't know what inputs I'm doing"
[2:49:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They need turbo in dmc5
[2:49:31] <RiceeFTW> @FuqBoiSlim it's tradition to remake blighttown every game LUL
[2:49:50] <thepiefoot> I might be the only fool who never plays DMC with turbo on, don't get me wrong, i want it in 5 as much as the next guy. I just won't use it

[2:59:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Prepare for giant turds
[2:59:47] <primaryfire> giving as much booze to the sculptor as possible will unlock great lore, but you need to cure him @woolieversus
[3:00:01] <DianaTheAscian> 20/20 vision
[3:00:11] <RiceeFTW> @FuqBoiSlim they're imitating the Sculptor and Isshin
[3:00:11] <%Lion_kun> i did not know she comes here
[3:00:13] <%alexandrecau> I'm her wolf
[3:00:18] <Zayasu> is that goku talking PogChamp
[3:00:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> old lady Shigechi
[3:00:32] <+0oki> prepare for some monkey business
[3:00:37] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:00:48] <RiceeFTW> BAKAYAROUUUU
[3:00:54] <+animaturgy> Sounds like the humonculus from brotherhood
[3:00:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm fairly sure thats actually goku's voice actor
[3:00:55] <fool_of_doom> share rice
[3:00:57] <bear_breaker20> Kappa
[3:00:58] <+PanicSwytch> Keep it
[3:01:00] <+conqab> o damn the good rice
[3:01:01] <fool_of_doom> rice is for sharing
[3:01:06] <%SirGO0SE> the good shit
[3:01:08] <+MagiKestral> the rice is literally free
[3:01:09] <thepiefoot> I'll never understand the hate for JP Goku seiyuu
[3:01:15] <NaturalGear> arigatayaYAYAYAYA
[3:01:16] <+PanicSwytch> Rice is good for boss fights
[3:01:22] <RiceeFTW> I've grown to love/hate it
[3:01:22] <NiktenKing> Old lady ASMR
[3:01:26] <dan_g_v> what is tsunade saying?
[3:01:28] <%SirGO0SE> @thepiefoot i see people say that but i also never see the hate
[3:01:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also rice is best given to someone else
[3:01:34] <bear_breaker20> farming is eternal Kappa
[3:01:40] <%gigacanuck> @thepiefoot it's an old woman, that's the issue
[3:01:45] <LTKonnor> Wait
[3:01:55] <LTKonnor> Did Woolie ever fight the monkey boss?
[3:01:56] <%SirGO0SE> wow gigacanuck immediately making me wrong
[3:01:56] <%gigacanuck> puppet jutsu?
[3:02:11] <NaturalGear> she just have alzheimer Sekiro
[3:02:15] <%gigacanuck> I'm sorry, but Sean is just a better Goku voice
[3:02:20] <LTKonnor> Oh
[3:02:21] <RiceeFTW> hard is right
[3:02:22] <%hassanico1> OOO OOO OOO
[3:02:23] <RiceeFTW> fuck me
[3:02:25] <DianaTheAscian> one of my fav boss
[3:02:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> I see people clown granma goku but I never see "I hate grandma goku" from anyone
[3:02:27] <CalderGaming> the health bar says Hard Progress
[3:02:28] <%hassanico1> UNGA BUNGA
[3:02:33] <SixthSun2> Hard as bricks
[3:02:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I hear that voice, and i think "if only that was the voice of a full grown man"
[3:02:41] <KillMyPast> Sean is a trash person anyways
[3:02:58] <%SirGO0SE> ya like you can like Sean but that doesn't mean you have to hate grandma
[3:02:59] <+bubbli97> yes, Inner Sanctum
[3:03:00] <RiceeFTW> if you listen very closely, you can hear it say something quietly. it says "git gud"
[3:03:12] <%SirGO0SE> RiceeFTW LUL
[3:03:14] <primaryfire> it's not the ending that unlocks a bonus boss but it is the best ending
[3:03:23] <thepiefoot> I had early VHS of the DBZ movies so i've been used to Goku OG Seiyuu from childhood, guess that's why i don't hate her
[3:03:35] <Djinnazz> 2nd best
[3:03:48] <+bubbli97> @WoolieVersus Have you decided which ending you want yet?
[3:03:55] <fool_of_doom> ahhh that kirby light is so cute
[3:04:09] <RiceeFTW> PogChamp
[3:04:11] <fool_of_doom> btw what are the rules for this chat?
[3:04:13] <%SirGO0SE> SCOOTS CONFIRM
[3:04:20] <thepiefoot> Are they going to brake them there too ?
[3:04:23] <%gigacanuck> I just don't think Goku should sound like my grandmother Kappa
[3:04:28] <@Menitta> Is Montreal like that town in Hot Fuzz where The Greater Good?
[3:04:35] <+TuskDeluxe> prepare for them thrown about on streets
[3:04:36] <%SirGO0SE> need a Gon in 60 seconds filmed on scoots
[3:04:38] <DianaTheAscian> @fool_of_doom dont spam or be toxic
[3:04:46] <Psyramics> best grinding spot in game doesn't unlock until way later
[3:04:46] <Pillagius> Just in case - "Best farming spots" change as you progress. So for now Fort may be the best one in terms of xp and materials, but the second mansion idol run still one of the easiest and best money farm
[3:04:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well, the voice works for child goku, but seiyuu never change, even if the character eventually turns into a burly man
[3:04:59] <fool_of_doom> ah ok thank you @Nina96
[3:05:08] <%RyuuAoi> It starts with you TWO! Put the scoots back!
[3:05:08] <+lmybestfriendl> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[3:05:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> a burly man with 2 kids btw
[3:05:22] <%SirGO0SE> will fucking beat the shit out of you
[3:05:33] <%SirGO0SE> in your wallet*
[3:05:36] <%gigacanuck> throw them in the river and report them
[3:05:38] <RiceeFTW> what if people just steal the scooter
[3:05:40] <@Menitta> Ah they made the job market of "Scooter Finders"
[3:05:43] <%gigacanuck> LUL
[3:05:44] <thepiefoot> @fruit_pie_the_magician I totally understand keeping Goku's Seiyuu, the only single thing i will never like about the OG JP dub is having all the Son family with the same VA
[3:05:50] <bear_breaker20> FUN FACT: Montreal isnt real, and is also confirmed to be where MK Ultra experiments took place*
[3:05:50] <%RyuuAoi> I mean we have bike rentals where I live. Be responsible. Assholes
[3:06:19] <RiceeFTW> but you can make a job for people to go around to pick them up, ezpz
[3:06:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:06:21] <%SirGO0SE> ya the charge shouldn't stop until its parked
[3:06:27] <RiceeFTW> but nawww just make money for the government instead LUL
[3:06:28] <thepiefoot> Will the scooter come free with you daily purchase of milk bags ?
[3:06:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> A burly man with two kids whos built like a brick shithouse
[3:06:41] <%gigacanuck> @RiceeFTW that sounds ripe for collaboration schemes Kappa
[3:06:48] <RiceeFTW> @thepiefoot the scooters have a compartment to hold your maple syrup LUL
[3:06:51] <turf_wind_and_fire> Scootie puff jr. suuuuuuuuckssssss!!!!
[3:06:54] <DatAsuna> Yes, people will always be shitty
[3:06:59] <%SirGO0SE> good community service i guess
[3:07:00] <BabyNaBackbrace> can't they just run the records for who rented it last and charge them a couple grand?
[3:07:04] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sbfpPat
[3:07:06] <a_mad_dragon> watch them just call uber drivers to pick them up LUL
[3:07:07] <%RyuuAoi> $5 every 30 min per scoot?
[3:07:13] <%gigacanuck> you fools, everyone knows the maple syrup is kept in a safe cupboard at home
[3:07:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> Uber is apparently being electric scooters to maryland too because I keep getting pop-ups for it whenever I use the apps
[3:07:20] <%SirGO0SE> darli dagger
[3:07:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> *bringing
[3:07:22] <%SirGO0SE> lmao
[3:07:36] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus So, what's up with those Cinderblocks in front of your stores?
[3:07:40] <thepiefoot> Yeah.. better save them for the MUGEN
[3:07:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And they probably thought it would be wierd if Goku was the only one with a squeaky old lady voice
[3:07:41] <%gigacanuck> Darli Dagger, but a guy
[3:07:46] <@Menitta> Definitely a boxer
[3:07:48] <%NeroInfinite> Too late we already know Darlington is yourperfect fightwoman
[3:07:49] <primaryfire> free labour bro
[3:07:54] <%RyuuAoi> You played yourself!
[3:07:55] <RiceeFTW> stealing character designs from streamers hggWoke

[3:09:56] <+linSP> does woolie have that one ninjutsu for the kite
[3:09:57] <%gigacanuck> interesting
[3:10:14] <bakkatohri> You know what's actually impossible to do? Getting the one and only achievement for Devil Daggers
[3:10:27] <primaryfire> how are you gonna keep the kite out without puppeteer ING? @lion_kun
[3:10:41] <+PanicSwytch> Oh she sounds better in Japanese. Her English voice over is to delicate

[3:16:25] <BeeNoons> watch the movie to find out
[3:16:31] <CalderGaming> @wooliewoolz where do you think he went? where did the other children go?
[3:16:33] <%hassanico1> @WoolieVersus maybe go to where the spirited away go?
[3:16:45] <primaryfire> man I would totally buy a black shirt with a deathblow marker on it
[3:16:51] <CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus where do you think he went? where did the other children go?
[3:16:52] <RiceeFTW> am I the only one gettin mad frame dips?
[3:17:06] <%hassanico1> ...
[3:17:07] <Djinnazz> mine looks fine
[3:17:08] <bear_breaker20> reincarnation and its implications are scary when knowledge thereof can be withheld ay monks?
[3:17:08] <%hassanico1> welp
[3:17:13] <RiceeFTW> mmmmm nop
[3:17:13] <%hassanico1> WEEEEELP
[3:17:20] <+0oki> minh you have to tell him how to do this, its so obscure
[3:17:28] <%gigacanuck> puppeteer
[3:17:30] <%Lion_kun> woolie you have to use your puppeteer jutsu
[3:17:31] <RiceeFTW> it's very not obvious
[3:17:31] <%hassanico1> it's not obscure at all though?
[3:17:32] <+linSP> minh you gotta spell it out
[3:17:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kinmonon
[3:17:41] <SixthSun2> Minh, this isn't very obvious, you may have to tell him
[3:17:45] <BeeNoons> it's not obscure but you expect it to reset
[3:17:55] <%hassanico1> ok seriously y'all why are you calling this not obvious?
[3:18:03] <kinmonon> did woolie get the dry fruit in the cave yet?
[3:18:04] <DianaTheAscian> minh just tell him
[3:18:06] <thepiefoot> Gratitude is way more expensive, use the rice Kappa
[3:18:07] <Professor_Rakor> or black hat can hint you
[3:18:09] <RiceeFTW> cuz you have to give the woman an item and she gives you a riddle lol
[3:18:10] <kinmonon> if so dont do the kite
[3:18:10] <+linSP> well the old lady in this area will tell you it better
[3:18:13] <smallboops> just let woolie figure it out lol
[3:18:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'm like 60% sure I was reincarnated as a whelk at one point
[3:18:17] <$Ralfclogs> Help Woolie he has to reset the puzzle
[3:18:27] <+gantz_zero> Woolie Will Figure It Out
[3:18:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The instant I got the ability to do this I went "THATS where you use this"
[3:18:32] <%Lion_kun> Don't worry kinmonon he can do the cave after even if he does the kite path first, it does not affect it, i've tried it personally
[3:18:37] <+0oki> its obvious if you do the quest with black hat badger first or talk to the lady
[3:18:43] <+cvp5127> easy
[3:18:46] <%hassanico1> Woolie literally doesn't remember pupeteer
[3:18:47] <+gantz_zero> that's not hard com eon
[3:18:48] <kinmonon> @Lion_kun then the cave will be boring
[3:18:52] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie would never had figured that out
[3:18:54] <kinmonon> minh was right
[3:18:57] <%Lion_kun> the snake will still be there
[3:19:06] <SaltyAzteca> Good job
[3:19:06] <%Lion_kun> there are two snakes lol
[3:19:06] <kinmonon> not if he killed it
[3:19:09] <thepiefoot> How much is left ?
[3:19:11] <CalderGaming> you use puppeteer twice in the whole game, it's a problem
[3:19:12] <%LocoCrazy_> LocoCrazy_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Conclusive DNA evidence reveals that its ya boy! Dropping by for a few. Seeing what's being figgurd' out. Seein' what's on fire. How are you blokes tonight?
[3:19:20] <%Lion_kun> there are two, i've tried it personally, it does not affect the cave path
[3:19:23] <+MagiKestral> why else would the guy be there if not to be puppeted
[3:19:37] <DianaTheAscian> @MagiKestral die
[3:19:37] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> PogChamp no hit speed run
[3:19:40] <bear_breaker20> @FuqBoiSlim wtf is a whelk , some african deer?
[3:19:41] <RiceeFTW> yeah, I don't see how the cave route would get messed up

[3:46:28] <BabyNaBackbrace> very similar style to Ludwig the Accursed
[3:46:29] <+MagiKestral> woolie sees grapple points and thinks it's the ape lol
[3:46:37] <%hassanico1> this is Woolie's "Jump around randomly" technique taken to the limit
[3:46:47] <KillMyPast> Dont be a coward woolie
[3:46:50] <KillMyPast> Deflect that shit

[3:47:39] <thepiefoot> This boss is okay, but you known what it needs ? Terror Kappa
[3:47:47] <+Caped_Eggy> Probably a homage to dung pie from dark souls
[3:47:48] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie that only works if you actually attack afterwards
[3:47:51] <+golfertony> This was a fun fight tbh
[3:47:54] <%hassanico1> Woolie fucking scared for his life
[3:47:55] <AncelDeLambert> crap, I forgot what the baboon monster was called
[3:47:56] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Man Rajang looks pretty different this time around

[3:48:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> does Blagonga fart though?
[3:48:26] <SixthSun2> Congalala is the one that throws shit

[3:50:25] <+NoKingArthur> @WoolieVersus the gourd doesn't heal poison, it just reduces build up
[3:50:26] <AncelDeLambert> @king_wragles LUL
[3:50:29] <KillMyPast> What you need to do is not jump all over the place
[3:50:37] <%hassanico1> oh god

[3:50:40] <%QueequegTheater> The fireworks DO work
[3:50:41] <%hassanico1> he's out of spirit emblems
[3:50:41] <AncelDeLambert> the fireworks, they do nothing!
[3:50:42] <RiceeFTW> fireworks are good
[3:50:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> You have to channel your inner homie quan
[3:50:42] <%QueequegTheater> You missed
[3:50:50] <Professor_Rakor> the fireworks are good, you just missed
[3:50:51] <+CrescentRubyRose> Crackers stagger EVERYTHING
[3:50:51] <+golfertony> Hey half that life bar
[3:50:51] <%king_wragles> I don't understand unseen aid, can someone use small words to explain it please?
[3:50:51] <turf_wind_and_fire> It did during Max's stream I think
[3:50:52] <%hassanico1> You missed all your fireworks
[3:50:52] <RiceeFTW> but the range is buns unless it's upgraded
[3:50:53] <%Lion_kun> fireworks work but he can sometimes armor through it]
[3:50:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> never stop going in
[3:50:54] <+gantz_zero> they work but they have to be used at the right time
[3:50:57] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[3:51:44] <thepiefoot> Don't jump back. Immediately starts jumping back LUL
[3:51:47] <+mecha_11> lmao is he even looking at chat ffor this fight? I hope not.
[3:51:49] <AncelDeLambert> f
[3:52:01] <RiceeFTW> keeps jumping at the wrong times LUL
[3:52:02] <AncelDeLambert> that is a poop BOULDER
[3:52:05] <%GabeSweetMan> It feels like a Bloodborne boss but it totally operates by the same rules as all the other bosses. Just block/deflect 90% of his nonsense.
[3:52:10] <bear_breaker20> parry the poo, wipe the blade, kage
[3:52:11] <DianaTheAscian> christ
[3:52:11] <%QueequegTheater> Why does Woolie think the grapple is some high-damage move? It's literally just one free slash
[3:52:15] <%jubejube56> @mecha_11 he already knows though
[3:52:31] <+mecha_11> @jubejube56 i know. I meant in general
[3:52:34] <%hassanico1> @QueequegTheater coward tactics at maximum
[3:52:35] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Has Woolie tried tumbing him in the eye yet?
[3:52:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> he hasn't been looking at chat a lot this stream minh reads most thing to him
[3:52:39] <RiceeFTW> YES WOOLIE DO IT
[3:52:39] <thepiefoot> @GabeSweetMan I haven't even gotten to this boss yet, wouldn't you get posture broken by all the flailling attacks ?
[3:52:42] <%king_wragles> I think I can see the go in points, not sure
[3:52:45] <RiceeFTW> ROYAL GUARD HIS CHEEKS
[3:52:55] <GrandMazterNelson> anyone else think that he looks like ape Kratos ?
[3:53:01] <%QueequegTheater> @thepiefoot not really
[3:53:07] <SixthSun2> Apetos
[3:53:10] <+gantz_zero> 100% @GrandMazterNelson
[3:53:10] <%QueequegTheater> You have to wail on his head
[3:53:11] <%GabeSweetMan> @thepiefoot It's the same percentage as basically any flailing attacks. So long as your timing is right, you don't take posture damage.
[3:53:15] <%Skullgod> @QueequegTheater hey
[3:53:18] <%QueequegTheater> It staggers him
[3:53:23] <%QueequegTheater> @Skullgod yo
[3:53:23] <%GabeSweetMan> It's just tough to time it.
[3:53:25] <DianaTheAscian> nice
[3:53:39] <AncelDeLambert> I would not go near this fight without weighted chains, a buttload of spears, and ten other dudes
[3:53:41] <RiceeFTW> he's learning hggShaq
[3:53:43] <thepiefoot> @GabeSweetMan Gotcha, so just stay in his groin and deflect everything and go away for the farts. Right ?
[3:53:44] <%GabeSweetMan> His movements make it hard to tell when you're SUPPOSED to parry.
[3:53:47] <%QueequegTheater> "Get out of this corner" in the middle of the arena
[3:54:02] <%GabeSweetMan> @thepiefoot Basically.
[3:54:10] <%QueequegTheater> Attack twice, dodge to the side
[3:54:12] <%thechungiestofbois> anyone play bloodstained?
[3:54:14] <+gantz_zero> gigantic telegraph
[3:54:15] <%king_wragles> those bravery sips

[3:55:00] <%QueequegTheater> FFS
[3:55:08] <Djinnazz> you can block it.
[3:55:09] <RiceeFTW> @FuqBoiSlim yes but you take poison damage
[3:55:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Alllll of these hits can be blocked/parried.
[3:55:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> nice
[3:55:24] <DianaTheAscian> pellet
[3:55:26] <%QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[3:55:28] <%thechungiestofbois> would have been pretty dope if the crackers ignited the farts
[3:55:28] <%king_wragles> give Woolie you're "get in there" energy \o/
[3:55:29] <AncelDeLambert> boo, From, you should be able to set the farts on fire, booo
[3:55:29] <%hassanico1> The gourd doesn't cure poison dude
[3:55:34] <+Vorga1339> I wonder how many times he's gonna sip gourd after getting poisoned

[3:55:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 4 minutes
[3:55:35] <CalderGaming> is he out of antidotes?
[3:55:36] <%Lion_kun> when is woolie going to learn the gourd doesn't help against poison
[3:55:37] <%Blackjackal95> the gourd doesn't heal the poison
[3:55:39] <+ChunLoArt> Why does he keep on jumping
[3:55:39] <RiceeFTW> if only there was an ANTIDOTE for the POISON
[3:55:39] <Calek> rice is a better option
[3:55:39] <%GabeSweetMan> If there's no danger symbol you can block basically for free.
[3:55:41] <+HuoShengdi> @WoolieVersus you need an antidote to cure the poison
[3:55:49] <%QueequegTheater> antidote
[3:55:53] <DianaTheAscian> NotLikeThis
[3:55:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Did he not buy the green gourd?
[3:55:58] <CalderGaming> logging off this is zzzzz
[3:55:58] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:56:05] <MasshuShirouchi> green gourd cures build up,
[3:56:06] <DianaTheAscian> you could do tonight
[3:56:06] <+gantz_zero> he did @GabeSweetMan
[3:56:07] <%hassanico1> @GabeSweetMan he's using it only AFTER getting poisoned
[3:56:08] <%GabeSweetMan> FFS
[3:56:11] <thepiefoot> @ChunLoArt Cause Woolie is scurred
[3:56:11] <MasshuShirouchi> not the actual ailment
[3:56:14] <DianaTheAscian> NO
[3:56:15] <+thesw1tch> @gabesweetman its what he drinks every time after getting poisoned
[3:56:16] <+mecha_11> @CalderGaming gtfo
[3:56:21] <%Blackjackal95> @WoolieVersus Gourd is for poison resistance

[3:56:45] <RiceeFTW> he's wrong, it totally heals it
[3:57:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah but you have to use it Woolie!
[3:57:03] <Professor_Rakor> antidote does remove it, gourd does not

[3:57:19] <+king_egret_sly> no, just like the burn gourd doesn't cure burn
[3:57:19] <+bubbli97> @WoolieVersus Gourd doesnt heal status effect, antidote does but Gourd gives more resistance
[3:57:23] <RiceeFTW> antidote should remove it
[3:57:25] <Professor_Rakor> reading the card explains the card
[3:57:28] <%king_wragles> @RiceeFTW 3
[3:57:28] <+gantz_zero> fice is full of shit gourd is resistance only
[3:57:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> WHO DO I BELIEVE
[3:57:31] <RiceeFTW> which it does because it says HEALS STATUS ABNORMALITY
[3:57:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> WHICH ONE DO I SHOOT
[3:57:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Big 3
[3:57:49] <+RayDaug> Only trust your fists. Chat will never help you
[3:57:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Chat we have to shoot ourselves to save Woolie.
[3:57:51] <%QueequegTheater> @FuqBoiSlim All of us
[3:57:54] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Shoot bolth
[3:57:54] <+thesw1tch> @fuqboislim shoot both, call it a day
[3:57:54] <Professor_Rakor> just shove every medicine in you at once, no problems will occur
[3:57:57] <+mecha_11> @jubejube56 this is why lmao
[3:57:58] <%QueequegTheater> Oh god he's reverse Pat
[3:58:00] <thepiefoot> You need to be in Gunslinger to use fireworks tho
[3:58:03] <%Lion_kun> use a puch
[3:58:12] <%Lion_kun> use a puchbuy 16 and take one more crack
[3:58:15] <%GabeSweetMan> No it's GUN woolie!
[3:58:18] <%Lion_kun> use a puch
[3:58:23] <%QueequegTheater> But what do the emblems do in trickster tho
[3:58:23] <%Lion_kun> use a pouch
[3:58:25] <%gunslinger_xxiv> lumpytMario
[3:58:45] <%thechungiestofbois> @QueequegTheater this is known. Woolie is very defensive, Pat is very offensive
[3:58:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> alright chat let's go ape woolieSMUG
[3:58:56] <%GabeSweetMan> apatBig FART
[3:59:03] <+gantz_zero> pat offends every week /drumshot
[3:59:05] <chronoxgp> gotta block/parry that
[3:59:05] <%king_wragles> Can you parry the poop?
[3:59:06] <thepiefoot> Woolie only reads chat when he is looking for beef
[3:59:08] <+HuoShengdi> woolie needs to make more use of sprinting as an avoidance tool
[3:59:09] <%QueequegTheater> Which is why Pat annihilated this game and Woolie is getting whooped by it
[3:59:12] <Aydarkzero> get em!
[3:59:16] <%king_wragles> ... I'll take sentences I never thought I'd say for 600 Alex
[3:59:17] <RiceeFTW> woolie playing like a stinky blanka main, laming it out
[3:59:26] <KasiCrafter> Pat killed his runs before he even started...
[3:59:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah you can block the dookie
[3:59:38] <thepiefoot> @RiceeFTW And non stop jump ins
[3:59:51] <RiceeFTW> lmfao fr just blanka ball in neutral
[4:00:04] <$Ralfclogs> Woolie your blanka is showing Kappa
[4:00:10] <KasiCrafter> Is Woolie's mic super quiet for anyone else?
[4:00:13] <+Dives__> Firecrackers are very effective
[4:00:22] <+gantz_zero> yeah he moved it or something @KasiCrafter
[4:00:22] <thepiefoot> @KasiCrafter The game is super loud
[4:00:23] <%QueequegTheater> jumping 1 into jumping 1 into jumping 1
[4:00:24] <%hassanico1> wait does woolie play like a coward in most games cause Blanka's playstyle is cowardly?
[4:00:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> the game's just loud here
[4:00:26] <+HuoShengdi> no he's pretty quiet on my end too
[4:00:26] <%thechungiestofbois> firecrackers are the most effective tool
[4:00:29] <%king_wragles> I think Woolie is just generally kinda quiet when he's focused
[4:00:31] <%thechungiestofbois> its usually a free stun
[4:00:40] <MasshuShirouchi> stahp jumping, please
[4:00:40] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> air parries sbfpYeyeye
[4:00:43] <+HuoShengdi> omg he keeps jumping backwards during the damage opening
[4:00:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Hang on how do we explain it to him via fighting game terms? WOOLIE, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT HIM AS IF YOU'RE FIGHTING A BLANKA MIRROR MATCH!
[4:00:47] <RiceeFTW> when an enemy is bent down on the ground, I'll remember to flying jump kick instead of USING MY SWORD
[4:00:54] <+buttdirt> lmao, the cliff blocked his poop
[4:01:01] <+gantz_zero> i feel like pat got through this "part" first try
[4:01:04] <+mecha_11> Maybe if you'd learn to use RoyalGuard Kappa
[4:01:06] <+PenmanLupine> everything is understandable if you explain it like a fighting game!
[4:01:13] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat totally won this first try.
[4:01:23] <%Lion_kun> that's a bullshit grab
[4:01:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> get fucking thrown
[4:01:34] <%QueequegTheater> @GabeSweetMan But he's already fighting like Blanka
[4:01:38] <%king_wragles> @GabeSweetMan lies. but did that atually happen?
[4:01:41] <thepiefoot> Woolie needs to moment 37 instead of cornering himself by jumping backwards
[4:01:47] <RiceeFTW> BRO he's DOING IT
[4:01:56] <%king_wragles> shh shh
[4:01:56] <+gantz_zero> @king_wragles at least first phase, 100%
[4:01:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> YOOOOOO
[4:02:00] <%GabeSweetMan> @king_wragles Look up the vod. He beasts this boss in every version it appears.
[4:02:02] <RiceeFTW> but he keeps gettin SNATCHED
[4:02:08] <RiceeFTW> JUST TECH THE THROW
[4:02:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat literally never died to this boss a single time.
[4:02:12] <%king_wragles> @GabeSweetMan rad
[4:02:14] <%hassanico1> this ape has FGC combos
[4:02:17] <%QueequegTheater> Oh my god he literally can't think in anything but fighting game terms
[4:02:32] <RiceeFTW> SEE TOTALLY HEALED IT
[4:02:34] <RiceeFTW> you FUCKS
[4:02:44] <+HuoShengdi> almost!
[4:02:44] <%king_wragles> You said the gourd healed it?
[4:02:45] <MasshuShirouchi> no one was saying the antidote didnt heal
[4:02:48] <%gunslinger_xxiv> evoTBC
[4:02:49] <RiceeFTW> no I didn't?
[4:02:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> SAY GOODBYE MONKEY

[4:03:26] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Everyone knows
[4:03:26] <+velocitasfortis> Woolie's already been spoiled on this fight, unfortunately
[4:03:28] <%hassanico1> TERROR
[4:03:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> AAHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK
[4:03:29] <MasshuShirouchi> ahmahgerd
[4:03:30] <%Lion_kun> get the terror gourd
[4:03:30] <$Ralfclogs> anders6JeAoi anders6JeAoi anders6JeAoi anders6JeAoi
[4:03:32] <Graxe_> It was hard not to get spoiled on this, really
[4:03:33] <RiceeFTW> these movements actually make me uncomfortable
[4:03:35] <AncelDeLambert> @bubbli97 Dunkey
[4:03:40] <+Dives__> He's using a sword as a sword
[4:03:40] <%QueequegTheater> No he's using a SWORD AS A SWORD
[4:03:41] <CHVMPLOO> "stick"
[4:03:42] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus nope, that's actually a sword
[4:03:42] <MasshuShirouchi> no, he's using a sword as a sword
[4:03:42] <+gantz_zero> he's using a sword as a sword you idiot
[4:03:43] <+RayDaug> Now he's the Dancer of the Boriel Valley
[4:03:43] <+mecha_11> HE'S LEARNING
[4:03:45] <thepiefoot> should've used his dung as a sword
[4:03:47] <KillMyPast> Thats a sword woolie
[4:03:47] <%Lion_kun> i find phase 2 wasier
[4:03:49] <%Skullgod> what the fuck kind of stick is that
[4:03:49] <+HuoShengdi> he's using the sword you cut his head off with
[4:03:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Hey he's blocking and deflecting!
[4:03:50] <turf_wind_and_fire> @WoolieVersus He's using the sword that was in him
[4:03:53] <RiceeFTW> yes, it has a sword so DEFLECT IT
[4:03:57] <%hassanico1> This is the part where you use Spear on his neck stump
[4:03:57] <chronoxgp> the sword is possessed whoolie
[4:04:04] <+Who_lio42> a sword is a sort of stick
[4:04:04] <+PenmanLupine> sword = stick
[4:04:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Personally I always found THIS phase WAYYYY easier.
[4:04:12] <%hassanico1> Spear on his neck lets you pull out his worm insides
[4:04:14] <%thechungiestofbois> OOF
[4:04:14] <+Who_lio42> whew
[4:04:14] <%QueequegTheater> Does divine confetti work on this version
[4:04:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> clutch
[4:04:20] <%thechungiestofbois> big fear
[4:04:22] <%hassanico1> HOT DAMN
[4:04:28] <billysan291> I loved this boss
[4:04:37] <RiceeFTW> woolie wall jumping out of corner, nice
[4:04:44] <AncelDeLambert> come on, Woolie, get IN THERE
[4:04:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Divine confetti does indeed work.
[4:04:59] <thepiefoot> Terror is the best mechanic From has ever come up with Kappa
[4:05:00] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:05:10] <%hassanico1> It's too bad he can't use Spear
[4:05:20] <%hassanico1> no more spirit emblems at all
[4:05:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> life is just one really long street fighter match if you really think about it
[4:05:23] <AncelDeLambert> I think he shakes the head like a maracca
[4:05:33] <%Blackjackal95> he does put his head back on to scream
[4:05:36] <%king_wragles> @hassanico1 you can buy more tho right?
[4:05:39] <+gantz_zero> "he doesn't put his head back on" HE LITERALLY DOES
[4:05:39] <%QueequegTheater> This stream is 80% jump-ins
[4:05:40] <+HuoShengdi> @WoolieVersus he totally puts his head back on his neck hole for the scream
[4:05:41] <+velocitasfortis> Uses the head as a big whistle
[4:05:47] <henshin2289> Literally not paying attention the game. How do you not see the sword that is in his neck, is used to cut off his head, and then he picks the sword up.
[4:05:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Argh... he did it the first time. Now he jumps throughout the entirety of the best combo to build up stamina damage.
[4:05:50] <AncelDeLambert> oh, he does put it back on
[4:05:51] <+RayDaug> From is the best developer with the worst habits. They can't help themselves. The HAVE to put in a poison bog and an instant kill.
[4:05:55] <tigerspath> woolie should try using item from inventory
[4:06:01] <RiceeFTW> woolie with the delayed tech lmaoo
[4:06:03] <AncelDeLambert> he's got two more lives, he's fine
[4:06:05] <+velocitasfortis> Dangit Woolie, STOP JUMPING
[4:06:23] <+bubbli97> @AncelDeLambert He has one more, cant use after a revive
[4:06:27] <KillMyPast> Woolie needs to stop jumping
[4:06:29] <+bubbli97> well now none
[4:06:39] <NeoRageX456> woolie you need to play sekiro not divekick
[4:06:39] <%thechungiestofbois> @AncelDeLambert he doesn't he has to get a critical to use those lives
[4:06:42] <%QueequegTheater> He's a Blanka main, he can't
[4:06:42] <+mecha_11> *continues to leap frog across arena*
[4:06:44] <+HellCopter> he's so scared of the monkey that he's forgotten how to parry
[4:06:50] <AncelDeLambert> oh, boo that mechanic, boo From
[4:06:51] <+gantz_zero> ape is using a sword as a sword..... @WoolieVersus
[4:06:52] <thepiefoot> Dunno where woolie got the jumping habit from, no other souls game have jumps. Must be all the years of playing Blanka
[4:06:54] <RiceeFTW> he has a SWORD
[4:06:56] <%Lion_kun> woolie jumps that too early
[4:07:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Woolie fears the Ape
[4:07:05] <+Dives__> That is a sword
[4:07:07] <+HellCopter> It's a sword
[4:07:09] <%QueequegTheater> THE WOOD?
[4:07:09] <Djinnazz> that's a sword Woolie
[4:07:11] <RiceeFTW> it's the SWORD from his neck
[4:07:11] <DianaTheAscian> ITS A SWORD
[4:07:13] <+gantz_zero> IT'S A SWORD
[4:07:14] <%GabeSweetMan> You idiot WE ALL HAVE SWORDS!
[4:07:14] <%QueequegTheater> BIG WOOD
[4:07:14] <%Lion_kun> jump a half second after you see that danger sign not onr eaction
[4:07:16] <purple_bagel> This fight took me days i hate it so much
[4:07:17] <%Blackjackal95> Yeah jumping is only really useful for two things in this game: midair deathblows and dodging sweeps
[4:07:19] <AncelDeLambert> you're not parrying because you're NOT PARRYING Woolie!
[4:07:20] <$Ralfclogs> It's a sword
[4:07:21] <RiceeFTW> IT'S A GUN WOOLIE
[4:07:21] <+HuoShengdi> you're not parrying it because YOU KEEP JUMPING
[4:07:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> in the first phase he has a sword in his neck and you cut his head odd
[4:07:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> off
[4:07:32] <KasiCrafter> @WoolieVersus Your mic! And the game is LOUD.
[4:07:34] <%Lion_kun> for a third attempt, that was great
[4:07:34] <+velocitasfortis> Literally unnecessary to jump in this fight, even once, in either phase, ever. Grapple or run away from grabs and sweeps.
[4:07:36] <KillMyPast> You just keep jumping
[4:07:37] <+gantz_zero> and yes he puts the head back on @WoolieVersus
[4:07:49] <turf_wind_and_fire> No
[4:07:50] <+gantz_zero> mic low, game loud
[4:07:51] <+velocitasfortis> Nah, seems fine
[4:07:51] <+mecha_11> NO
[4:07:52] <%SirGO0SE> its fine
[4:07:53] <Fabulich> No?
[4:07:53] <+Dives__> Nope
[4:07:53] <DianaTheAscian> mic low game loud
[4:07:54] <thepiefoot> Mic low, game loud
[4:07:54] <%gunslinger_xxiv> No
[4:07:55] <fool_of_doom> no
[4:07:56] <%thechungiestofbois> mic low, game fine
[4:07:57] <AncelDeLambert> the game is a bit loud in combat
[4:07:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> mic low game loud
[4:07:57] <%GabeSweetMan> @velocitasfortis Except sweep attacks.
[4:07:58] <%AuksMattin> game is kinda loud
[4:07:58] <+Who_lio42> mic low game lowd
[4:07:59] <%steelmorrigan> it's fine
[4:07:59] <+HellCopter> If both are loud...turn your volume down, chat member?
[4:07:59] <+thesw1tch> game can be loud when its yelling
[4:07:59] <+tymetak> mic low game loud
[4:08:00] <@Menitta> You are fine
[4:08:01] <+PanicSwytch> What does the wood do in gunslinger?
[4:08:01] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> it's just the boss. the boss is loud
[4:08:03] <+Risingxiv> game pretty loud
[4:08:04] <AnActualHermitCrab> mic low, game is loud.
[4:08:05] <+mecha_11> Everything is fine
[4:08:06] <billysan291> The Ape roar is load thats all.
[4:08:06] <crabstealer> Game is pretty loud in comparison
[4:08:13] <dmtjinni> Anyone watch Boruto?
[4:08:21] <NaturalGear> when the game's loud we can't hear you
[4:08:28] <%jinking79> can't hear the problem
[4:08:31] <RiceeFTW> hggOkay FBBlock watching burrito
[4:08:31] <DianaTheAscian> no
[4:08:42] <%Lion_kun> good session
[4:08:56] <%QueequegTheater> You should stop using emblems outside of boss fights
[4:09:00] <dmtjinni> Watch last ep you def change your mind
[4:09:01] <%Lion_kun> once you get past the guardian ape, you can start the road to the endgame
[4:09:01] <+velocitasfortis> @GabeSweetMan Still unnecessary. There's a massive open arena. I have done this fight dozens of times without jumping once. Grapples and runs can get you away from every sweep. Jumping is FINE for most people, but not for Woolie, because he mashes jump non-stop.
[4:09:05] <thepiefoot> You should spend your spirit emblems in jumping Kappa
[4:09:06] <NaturalGear> and it's cooler
[4:09:09] <$trueherobappo> I can't stand to watch this man try to solve his problems by jumping randomly..
[4:09:15] <$trueherobappo> Later chat..
[4:09:17] <%hassanico1> @WoolieVersus dunno if you'll be able to do it, but you can shove the Spear up his neck in phase 2 if you parry him enough
[4:09:20] <RiceeFTW> jump works for the sweeps and it's what you're supposed to do lol
[4:09:20] <%QueequegTheater> Well stop, it's bad
[4:09:21] <%SirGO0SE> you utilize the kit well
[4:09:23] <+mecha_11> Woolie: "Parrying??"
[4:09:24] <AncelDeLambert> @WoolieVersus did you enjoy fighting the Congalala?
[4:09:24] <RiceeFTW> but not for normal attacks
[4:09:30] <%Lion_kun> I jump the sweeps and nothing else
[4:09:36] <%GabeSweetMan> @velocitasfortis Admittedly yes, for Woolie it's wasted.
[4:10:09] <+gantz_zero> your body stops glowing when the resistance is gone @WoolieVersus
[4:10:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:10:12] <Psyramics> there's one non-sweep thats super useful to jump cause he has a long cooldown where you can get a few hits in
[4:10:15] <%Lion_kun> phase 2 of the ape is mroe about patience, jump the sweeps, run from the terror and try and deflect his sword strikes, if you parry them properly he does a huge overhead and if you parry that he falls on his ass and you getf ree damage
[4:10:25] <RiceeFTW> ichimonji is godlike
[4:10:30] <%RyuuAoi> Chat, MAYBE, now think this through now, but MAYBE you have your headphone volume a little too high.
[4:10:37] <RiceeFTW> ichimonji is FREE
[4:10:49] <dmtjinni> BORUTO Byakugan
[4:10:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Yes his cooldowns are crazy long.
[4:10:57] <+mecha_11> Chat, MAYBE, now think this through now, but MAYBE you have your headphone volume a little too high.
[4:11:03] <Calek> @RyuuAoi excuse you my headphones are PERFECTLY CALIBRATED
[4:11:19] <+HuoShengdi> He actually goes down much faster if you stay in and parry
[4:11:24] <Puhff> Well he is an immortal giant ape soooo...
[4:11:30] <+gantz_zero> it's fine until the game gets it's loudest
[4:11:33] <%RyuuAoi> Respect, Calek!
[4:11:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> my $5 came-with-my-iphone earbuds are perfectly fine
[4:11:40] <RiceeFTW> my headphones and windows are on 100, why are the streams so loud distThink
[4:11:41] <+gantz_zero> then it can be hard to hear his mic, that's all
[4:11:51] <Puhff> Naruto run at him
[4:12:35] <%RyuuAoi> woolieREMEMBERS
[4:12:39] <henshin2289> You're not stunning him/capitalizing on that stun. Makes the fight go way faster.
[4:13:01] <DianaTheAscian> i actually have twitch low right no but the game gets super loud during the fight still
[4:13:08] <$trueherobappo> I can't stand to watch this man try to solve his problems by jumping randomly..
[4:13:11] <+bubbli97> Woolie will figure it out bo8Pog
[4:13:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> bro just jump in 4Head
