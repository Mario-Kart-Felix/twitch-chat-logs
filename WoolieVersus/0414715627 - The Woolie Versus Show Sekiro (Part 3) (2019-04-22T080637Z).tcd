[0:12:00] <Parapattern> sbfpDattebayo
[0:12:02] <%xeromage> man, what did we do before we could interactively bitch about volume levels
[0:12:06] <DatAsuna> Does woolie know what to do about kicks?
[0:12:06] <+blastazoid00> RIP archer guy
[0:12:12] <$connos_procrastination> just perfect parry every time
[0:12:16] <Pioldes> dodge+slash over and over
[0:12:17] <reonome> welp pat is live
[0:12:17] <nekodelic> @ubuyo allows you to not lose half of your shit when dying
[0:12:19] <+patriotrenegade> if I know one thing about Miyazaki its that he loves three things: the moon, bells and wolves
[0:12:19] <+Keith_Chop> yeah there are hardly any 100% strats for bosses
[0:12:26] <+Keith_Chop> everything is situational
[0:12:28] <Mr_Strut> 1 slashy 2 slashy 3 slashy 4.
[0:12:28] <mechslayer71> @ubuyo When you lose stuff it’s for good, no pick up. Unseen aid gives a chance to not lose on death
[0:12:29] <oneimportantthing> Grandma-chan needs to be taught a lesson desu.
[0:12:31] <+Quinis> shurikens are super good when shes in the air on the wires, it drops her to the ground for a bit of recovery
[0:12:31] <@Solidus_113> I managed to cheese her out last night with alternating 1 slash and nightjar
[0:12:32] <Prevot> @patriotrenegade and swamps
[0:12:34] <+NPCMatro> dodge to her left
[0:12:41] <TheYharnamTheorem> I had a shockingly easy time with Lady Butterfly, but a certain ape handed me my ass SO hard.
[0:12:53] <+demonsamura> 3 slurings
[0:12:57] <+Ubuyo> so Unseen Aid just has a random chance to pop on death?
[0:13:05] <+blastazoid00> MORTIS
[0:13:05] <+Keith_Chop> certain ape handed everyone an ass whooping
[0:13:15] <FourthQueen> someone tell Woolie that holding block regenerates posture faster
[0:13:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:13:17] <Psyramics> 1-2-deflect
[0:13:19] <GoldeNOVA> Damn OTGs
[0:13:19] <Psyramics> is how I did it
[0:13:25] <Tojyo> kick her head on the sweep works damn fine
[0:13:29] <+Aeoneth> @Ubuyo correct. THe chance is 30% maximum and goes down the more rdragonrot you have
[0:13:32] <jtsoppy137> !MOTIVATED
[0:13:32] <@Moobot> 289 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:13:34] <Parapattern> One, two, skip to your lou
[0:13:35] <+demonsamura> i think default chance for unseen aid is 30%
[0:13:38] <SouthPawPad> @WoolieVersus have u seen the exploit of this boss?
[0:13:42] <+linSP> woolie let me know if you wanna know a cheese strat i used
[0:13:47] <%HDmexiqtioner> This isn't fighting games? lol. jk. Hey Woolie. Hey Chat.
[0:13:49] <nekodelic> @ubuyo the more you die, the smaller the chance until you cure the dragonrot
[0:13:57] <+Robo_Wizard1> You should attack until they do an actual Parry if you want them to react predictably
[0:13:57] <augusm> uh oh
[0:14:00] <+einheri> Woolie, you can shuriken her out of the air
[0:14:00] <+patriotrenegade> christ

[0:14:53] <BlkFlameKami> grandma is proud
[0:14:55] <%HDmexiqtioner> boi
[0:14:57] <%FeelinNifty> That would actually be a really concept for an action game where the whole thing moves at like two seconds per frame
[0:15:02] <+Aeoneth> It's ok Woolie, this is the warmup
[0:15:03] <+Piemen99> time for a perfect

[0:16:09] <+Aeoneth> Iyt's the warmup
[0:16:11] <Tojyo> sorry
[0:16:12] <+ozwalldoe> Blocking continuously refills posture quicker
[0:16:15] <+Aeoneth> Don't worry about it
[0:16:22] <caja_de_ojos> woolie is warming up with a 90 Kg weigth
[0:16:24] <+NPCMatro> 2 clashes and dodge to her left
[0:16:26] <Ristwach> Well there's no online
[0:16:33] <GoldeNOVA> You can warm up with some goons
[0:16:34] <Ristwach> unlike Souls and BB
[0:16:34] <thirstyskaven> oof
[0:16:38] <%HDmexiqtioner> This game looks like Dark Souls. :P
[0:16:45] <%HDmexiqtioner> joke
[0:16:48] <OldRuda> i come to the stream and he loses that much health at the start, hoboi
[0:16:51] <QaizerArt> GET EM
[0:16:54] <+patriotrenegade> she's like third phase Elfriede but with less bullshit
[0:16:56] <OldRuda> GO WOOLIE, DO THE THING

[0:17:12] <+deidriel> Woolie i cheesed it by just strafing left attack strafing left attack

[0:17:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This shit took me like two hours
[0:17:14] <thirstyskaven> F
[0:17:16] <$zero_g_toad> you might want to come back to this boss when you have more healing and health @woolieversus
[0:17:18] <didipackums1> just summon Tarkus
[0:17:24] <Ristwach> @thirstyskaven SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:17:25] <LTKonnor> M A D A M A D A
[0:17:25] <Tojyo> her overhead kick is the easiest to punish
[0:17:27] <+fragdar> @WoolieVersus hey wools
[0:17:28] <nekodelic> it's ironic that this is the fromsoft game that would be easier to balance for pvp and it doesn't have online
[0:17:30] <GoldeNOVA> Warm up Woolie, two days without playing strait to the boss is not great
[0:17:30] <SuperArson> lab it out
[0:17:39] <oneimportantthing> Believe in yourself. USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP
[0:17:40] <$BioStormX> You can keep attacking until you see the mega sparks fly, right?
[0:17:41] <+Robo_Wizard1> Don't wait for second swing, wait for them to Parry
[0:17:41] <+deidriel> You have to strafe after every swing you make
[0:17:42] <+demonsamura> this boss took me about 4 tries
[0:17:43] <+Aeoneth> 90% of the time she will parry the 3rd
[0:17:51] <Tojyo> pay atention when she do the jump in the end of the combo
[0:17:53] <Flare3500> Woolie attack when you hear a loud clang it means she deflected you then start defending\
[0:17:54] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus you can do it woolz, if I can shoot a bow, then you can snuff a granny
[0:18:04] <+demonsamura> last boss took me about 3 hours
[0:18:04] <nekodelic> the real parry are the friends we made along the way
[0:18:05] <%sirisvirus> the large flash is her parry and she will attack right after.
[0:18:08] <oneimportantthing> Get Pat on the stream to
[0:18:12] <+ChainsawBees> sidestep/ spin attack repeat
[0:18:15] <+Wintermute_VRC> Make sure to waste all your divine confetti fighting her
[0:18:15] <$zero_g_toad> after her first two spin kicks you can reapply pressure with attacks @woolieversus
[0:18:18] <+ChainsawBees> it breaks her ai
[0:18:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I had 2 heals and no upgrades at this point, you can fucking do it wools
[0:18:45] <%afronooch> yeah i went super hard on her and she couldn't attack
[0:18:45] <+demonsamura> woolie doesnt care about backseating?
[0:18:52] <Flare3500> loud clang means start defending
[0:19:11] <Tojyo> did he already killed the dude on the horse ?
[0:19:21] <Ristwach> Downloaded!
[0:19:24] <%linkwolf4> this game basically boils down to "learn the block strings dummy"
[0:19:26] <NekoZen> Woolie WIll Figure it Out
[0:19:31] <+Tuna_Can_0> yes
[0:19:31] <DrunkenFlask> He did @tojyo
[0:19:32] <LTKonnor> HE'S DOWNLOADED
[0:19:33] <GoldeNOVA> You're running out of arm juice NotLikeThis
[0:19:40] <+Robo_Wizard1> Nailed it Woolie, attacking until the CLANG is key to the game's flow
[0:19:42] <nekodelic> imagine Sekiro, but with Berserk 2016 sound effects
[0:19:44] <didipackums1> Woolie has ascended
[0:19:51] <thirstyskaven> F
[0:19:53] <vadnhi> She's old, so we should get Volta in here... I hear he's great at killing old folks. :P
[0:19:54] <Flare3500> Sweeps are obviously jump but you know that
[0:19:55] <%orangerainbow> you know during the illusion stuff if you just run in circle they eventually go away
[0:20:00] <+demonsamura> this game is basicly get your ass beat by the boss until you start beating their ass
[0:20:02] <Papafleish> what if you just git gud
[0:20:06] <toomanygnome> Just spam nightjar slash to get through her first phase without taking damage.
[0:20:13] <+Wintermute_VRC> If woolie figures out the loud clang this early on, will he trivialize the rest of the game?
[0:20:17] <Flare3500> Yeah it took me a while to figure that out I finished the game two times at least
[0:20:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:20:18] <+Tuna_Can_0> yea because you get a lot of posture dmg from their parry
[0:20:40] <+A123yourdead> I would say give him the old dick twist but no dick.
[0:20:41] <RyanGelatin> woolies gettin more views than pat he must be better
[0:20:49] <%sirisvirus> woolie figured out the huge mechanic. relizing that helped me with so many bosses
[0:20:49] <+D4C_Trice> @woolieversus have you checked out Vaati's latest video? It's super neat and I've learned stuff ready for when I get the game. Good luck!
[0:20:51] <%linkwolf4> yeah man, just call up VoltaBass, certified senior slayer.
[0:20:52] <RyanGelatin> oh wait pat beat this l;ady like 10 years ago
[0:20:54] <Tojyo> the best is to go do something else when stuck on the boss, this game is nonlinear as fuck
[0:20:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just go at it woolie, I literally fought her for like two hours, and then I owned her fucking ass and it was great
[0:21:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> its all pracice
[0:21:14] <+Champine> post podcast, its a new woolie
[0:21:16] <AMutePlays> sekiro is incredibly non-linear :)
[0:21:23] <nothuzad> @Wintermute_VRC nah I realized that on the first mini boss - but its cool that woolz got it now too :)
[0:21:47] <augusm> Woolie play Devil Trigger in the background it may help
[0:21:52] <+demonsamura> how far is woolie in? this boss is optional right so kinda hard to tell
[0:21:56] <Tojyo> i did the entire temple stuff when stuck on that bow and sword guy (tm)
[0:21:59] <fishmonger555> [LADY BUTTERFLY] is [PISSED] and has [KNIVES]
[0:22:01] <Tojyo> still didn't beat him tho
[0:22:11] <BenDovurr> just go ham and hit parry every second attack woolie
[0:22:14] <nothuzad> @demonsamura going form his health bar: not far :)
[0:22:17] <RyanGelatin> u got some good hits in
[0:22:18] <vadnhi> Lady Dio. :P

[0:23:02] <ElectricHoodie> i think the trick is to expel all fear from your soul
[0:23:03] <jotabranded> BIG CLANG = defend
[0:23:05] <Flare3500> Woolie do you have healing pills
[0:23:08] <oneimportantthing> Seriously bring Pat on
[0:23:15] <caja_de_ojos> BIG PROGRES
[0:23:21] <+demonsamura> reaction time is pretty important with fighting games right?
[0:23:25] <+Thunderhog> at least you got the strats, now its just getting rid of your mashing muscle memory
[0:23:33] <ElPlasa> F
[0:23:34] <+Tuna_Can_0> yea, its something you dont notice unless you look specifically

[0:23:35] <+Keith_Chop> RESET
[0:23:37] <+starpunchghost> that was a wash LUL
[0:23:38] <+Zaramoth> i think a good rule to set for youself is the first 2 or 3 times you go up against a boss, dont even swing. just try to learn blocks and evades
[0:23:38] <reonome> and you said you weren't playing a fighting game sbfpMember

[0:23:48] <Flare3500> Don't worry it will click to you my first fight against her is 2 hours then on my second playthrough first try
[0:23:58] <vadnhi> Pat would call this phase of things "The culmination of Woolie's failures"...
[0:24:00] <Kghaleon> Woolie, I find dash to the side and countering with R1 when she's guarding to be effective
[0:24:02] <+Keith_Chop> CLang is big
[0:24:08] <+Keith_Chop> big clang
[0:24:11] <+QuadraticGravity> The small clang means you got blocked, the big clang means you got deflected and counter coming.
[0:24:16] <+demonsamura> drop your shield
[0:24:19] <+Eclipse_knight_> woolie the pup
[0:24:21] <Sir_Carl> The jump kick was what made it click for me, getting damage off the sweep was huge

[0:24:35] <vadnhi> @demonsamura He doesn't have a shield to drop, tho... :/
[0:24:47] <Tucker0603> NICE
[0:24:48] <+demonsamura> drop it anyway
[0:24:49] <+fragdar> @WoolieVersus wools.. try to just block the combos (not parry) and then land a hit or two
[0:24:55] <Djinnazz> Keep that shield up
[0:24:55] <ElectricHoodie> that sweep-dash attack she does is a huge spam-punisher
[0:25:00] <vadnhi> Buy a shield, tehn drop it. :p
[0:25:13] <RyanGelatin> noooo never drop ur shield
[0:25:16] <+fragdar> just hold block
[0:25:20] <nerdblase> Clang cues.
[0:25:25] <+anime_boyz> if youre close to her while shes on strings you can jump up and slash at her
[0:25:27] <+Tuna_Can_0> oof
[0:25:27] <+ozwalldoe> Game works the opposite of drop your shield
[0:25:32] <+demonsamura> i thought it was kinda weird that holding the block button makes your posture go down faster
[0:25:38] <DatAsuna> Pat talking shit about woolie's soulc libur skills
[0:25:39] <SirGO0SE> pat throwing hard shade at woolief or loosing against rooster teeth in soul calibur
[0:25:45] <%juxtest> Dragonrot has overtaken the ninja orphanage
[0:25:46] <$FuqBoiSlim> did woolie just figure her out?
[0:25:50] <Tucker0603> need to buy more spirit emblems
[0:25:50] <SirGO0SE> man @DatAsuna we're real shitbirds
[0:26:01] <thirstyskaven> F
[0:26:03] <DatAsuna> multi track streaming
[0:26:03] <BenDovurr> swing twice then hold defend until she's done attacking
[0:26:04] <%xeromage> can you catch her kunai? that would be cool
[0:26:05] <+demonsamura> whats that kick he keeps doing?
[0:26:06] <+TransporterX7> That was a real good sequence
[0:26:12] <LTKonnor> mada mada
[0:26:13] <Tojyo> so close
[0:26:16] <thirstyskaven> you got this woolz
[0:26:17] <Flare3500> @demonsamura I think it's a form of risk and reward , because it's easier to deflect when you don't have your guard up so you have to choose between posture regen or deflecting
[0:26:23] <jotabranded> YES
[0:26:30] <vadnhi> I like how the Dragonrot thing isn't *you* hollowing out, but your deaths hollowing out everyone else *around* you.
[0:26:38] <Tucker0603> @srg00se but didn't Pat loose first or am I forgetting?
[0:26:39] <+Verd_254> when you land a clean hit try side stepping and slash again, It seems that delay opens her up for more hp damage.
[0:26:47] <ElPlasa> wait, you mean to tell me that Pat's "drop your shield" was the longest con of crazy talk?
[0:26:49] <+demonsamura> tbh i never just hold the block button
[0:26:50] <Tojyo> you can awlays spam the block button and do the dance
[0:26:51] <SirGO0SE> @Tucker0603 he def did
[0:26:56] <fishmonger555> I adore the thought process woolie has. Not knocking him, legit don't see it often. Have the time I just rely on reflex
[0:26:59] <%juxtest> Oh hes just out of arm candy
[0:27:07] <Tojyo> the parry window is quite generous
[0:27:09] <ElectricHoodie> no emblems, this is a good place to grind for them though
[0:27:18] <vadnhi> Yeah. you should buy more paper dolls, Woolie.
[0:27:18] <+Weeewer> How long has woolie been on butterfly
[0:27:18] <Tucker0603> @srg00se then doesn't that mean by proxy that he's calling himself shit?
[0:27:18] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:27:23] <ElectricHoodie> lots of cash and xp
[0:27:31] <Tojyo> and on the worse case, you still block
[0:27:32] <+Tuna_Can_0> you can deflect from guard, its awkward in the timing but still possible
[0:27:34] <SirGO0SE> @Tucker0603 he was born in the shit. molded by it.
[0:27:46] <SuperArson> I dunno if you remember the tip it gives you the first time you do this fight but dodge countering is more effective to lower her health first so her posture regains much more slowly
[0:27:56] <+demonsamura> moobot doesnt know whats going on
[0:28:27] <Flare3500> I don't think its worth doing that risky overheadslash
[0:28:29] <reonome> nice
[0:28:31] <alrobot2014> nice
[0:28:32] <ElPlasa> naisu
[0:28:33] <+Keith_Chop> yes

[0:28:58] <+QuadraticGravity> You can definitely keep her from doing it for a while via pressure
[0:29:11] <thirstyskaven> its okay its a good learning run
[0:29:19] <Zayasu> o shit didnt know woolie was streaming
[0:29:21] <+Keith_Chop> dont
[0:29:30] <+Champine> run the edge
[0:29:31] <Flare3500> just naruto run away you did well the first time
[0:29:32] <+Keith_Chop> just run
[0:29:36] <%afronooch> you can just run away from the illusions
[0:29:41] <+Keith_Chop> naruto run is unbeatable
[0:29:51] <%Rawpost> if you get her to a corner and pin her down with attacks, shurikens, and counters the illusions won't attack you
[0:29:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol I used the only snap see I had on my first try and then had to do without
[0:30:03] <ElectricHoodie> has anyone ever used the snap seeds effectively on their first run through of this boss? I know i never got close
[0:30:10] <oneimportantthing> Book it no jutsu
[0:30:29] <Tojyo> call billy the hokage
[0:30:30] <vadnhi> Use your pocket sand, Woolie. :P
[0:30:34] <+linSP> Oh no woolie is turning into pat with his "too good to use ever" style
[0:30:34] <fishmonger555> What's the Kanji about his head mean? Shinobi sense?
[0:30:35] <+Keith_Chop> just run
[0:30:39] <+demonsamura> i saw video of ppl "cheesing" bosses by running away from them and it looked harder than just straight up fighting them
[0:30:43] <thirstyskaven> F
[0:30:44] <+anime_boyz> if youre close to her while shes on strings you can jump up and slash at her and knock her down
[0:30:44] <+ozwalldoe> Keep blocking Woolie it refills your posture
[0:30:46] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Did you notice she's on top of the statue on fase 2, on it's left shoulder
[0:30:47] <drefizz> Mada mada
[0:30:54] <+Keith_Chop> lowering her health makes her posture regen slower so focus on that
[0:30:54] <ElectricHoodie> this is a great place to grind for them
[0:30:56] <ElPlasa> Mada mada
[0:30:57] <nerdblase> When was she not using suigetsu?
[0:30:59] <+Keith_Chop> dont be afraid to run
[0:31:12] <bevyrage> you can throw shuriken to knock her out of the air, which stops her from summoning illusions
[0:31:12] <%juxtest> Summoning adds that shoot projectiles from the back of the room? Is she Ninja Pinwheel?
[0:31:16] <Tojyo> grind some money on the guys behind you
[0:31:21] <bevyrage> but you have to start throwing when she crouches into the jump
[0:31:23] <+demonsamura> atleast you dont have to farm blood vials
[0:31:24] <Tojyo> and buy a shitload of charms
[0:31:25] <SuperArson> dodge attacking her moves instead of just parrying is more effective
[0:31:26] <ElectricHoodie> grinding here is excellent
[0:31:40] <Flare3500> Do you have fireworks woolie ?
[0:31:43] <Joey1995456> Nah, she is actually a threat unlike pinwheel
[0:31:45] <ElectricHoodie> i spent like 30 minutes here and got like 250 emblems
[0:31:46] <+Champine> 5 mins of grind
[0:31:49] <Tojyo> grind spot behind you
[0:31:52] <Elsewize> Get good! Kappa
[0:31:53] <+Keith_Chop> yeah the one thing I hated about Bloodborne was the vial system
[0:32:04] <+demonsamura> fireworks from the west
[0:32:06] <Rafikator> eyy woolzworth
[0:32:08] <Tojyo> is really easy after one damage upgrade
[0:32:09] <+Keith_Chop> cause you only had a limited amount of tries for a boss before you had to grind again
[0:32:11] <+PenmanLupine> Its not a waste if it helps you progress from a roadblock
[0:32:27] <Rafikator> soo how far in are we here
[0:32:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Its almost the only thing you can use money on
[0:32:39] <Flare3500> This is like the second boss
[0:32:42] <KaiserMario> Money and consumables are meant to be wasted, don't be like Pat and finish the game with 99 of everything, never using even one
[0:32:43] <+Keith_Chop> yeah money is pretty useless otherwise in this game
[0:32:48] <+Keith_Chop> they did a good job of balancing it
[0:32:50] <Tojyo> u get 2 charms per guy and there is like an entire mob behind this bonfire
[0:32:52] <+Robo_Wizard1> I forget that buying emblems is a thing, I've stockpiled so many hundreds of them
[0:32:57] <Rafikator> cool
[0:33:02] <+demonsamura> i acutally never used emblems, i think i finished the game with 300 something
[0:33:05] <Djinnazz> Apparently this is boss 7
[0:33:05] <Rafikator> he has a pretty long way to go
[0:33:14] <SuperArson> instead of parrying the stomp she does after the two swings, dodge backwards and then attack
[0:33:15] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:33:20] <vadnhi> Money is useless up until you get the shuriken ability that lets you throw handfuls of coins at enemies. :P
[0:33:23] <Rafikator> unless pat was just real slow about this
[0:33:24] <+Keith_Chop> yeah I did this much later
[0:33:36] <$connos_procrastination> cheer200 sending these bits like ki energy to defeat broly
[0:33:38] <+Keith_Chop> nah this game is pretty long
[0:33:39] <SuperArson> you can technically do this boss at any point, she's just the end of the area and there's nothing "past" this
[0:33:50] <+demonsamura> i almost never used combat arts either
[0:33:50] <Flare3500> You can throw money at enemies which I love because it deals so much damage
[0:33:52] <SuperArson> but if you're cool you do it first boss
[0:33:53] <TheOddestDuck> I'm struggling so hard with this game. it's been so hard to just stick with it :/
[0:34:03] <Rockgagong> hitting her mid-jump with shurikens saved me on this fight
[0:34:06] <Rafikator> YEYEYE
[0:34:08] <Rafikator> get em
[0:34:11] <+anime_boyz> @WoolieVersus if you run out of kunais to knock her off her strings then you can jump at her and hit her off
[0:34:14] <Tojyo> hold block to regen posture
[0:34:16] <Rafikator> oh fucked that up
[0:34:18] <+Keith_Chop> MADA MADA
[0:34:20] <%SuckerPunchSyd> so close
[0:34:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:21] <OctoBazooka> If you kill an add its very likely that they''ll drop a spirit emblem
[0:34:21] <sabrekins> badass grandma
[0:34:23] <Rafikator> Mada mada
[0:34:25] <LTKonnor> mada mada
[0:34:30] <Rafikator> yeah use the kunai
[0:34:33] <%theluckyhero> mada mada
[0:34:36] <caja_de_ojos> u farm later
[0:34:38] <Spyderninja> fireworks and shuriken saved my ass here
[0:34:39] <Dannzzyy> I believe in you wool
[0:34:42] <dos_cervezas> Doesn't this game remind you of vagabond?
[0:34:47] <Flare3500> as for the jump game run far away as possible then rush her while shes landing
[0:34:47] <+goochcaboose> does he know about keeping his guard up to regain posture?
[0:34:47] <+Aeoneth> PLus OWolie, don't forget your posture gets depleted faster when your low on health. When she jumps back, use that time to heal yourself to full
[0:34:49] <+Keith_Chop> fireworks are sooo good in this game
[0:34:54] <+Keith_Chop> just stuns everything
[0:34:57] <Rafikator> throw 2 kunais when she is in the air it useally works
[0:35:11] <+Shakespearoe> Jump in on those sweeps, son
[0:35:14] <Spyderninja> also, adds die in one hit, so shurikening them is ideal
[0:35:17] <+RadDude6969> be agressive B-E agressive
[0:35:19] <DaBelovedUnderdog> I would say only use it when she does the one withe symbol over head
[0:35:20] <+QuadraticGravity> Deflecting the falling stomp staggers her for stupid long
[0:35:27] <+Lutherian90> Has Woolie made it to p2?
[0:35:28] <+demonsamura> i didnt even unlock fireworks until the end of the game xD
[0:35:37] <Djinnazz> Yrah
[0:35:37] <Rafikator> dont let the cool voice acting scare you woolz
[0:35:39] <Ristwach> Yeyeyeye
[0:35:45] <+Keith_Chop> nice dude
[0:35:45] <Flare3500> Good run
[0:35:46] <+QuadraticGravity> Easy Phase 1
[0:35:47] <ElPlasa> noice
[0:35:48] <Rafikator> YE
[0:35:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> yeyeyeyeye
[0:35:49] <Kghaleon> This fight isn't mandatory, so he can easily come back later with 10 healing items.
[0:35:51] <Ristwach> Atta boy!
[0:35:51] <+thackattack00> I used fireworks to cheese entire life bars off bosses
[0:35:51] <Rafikator> NOW
[0:35:52] <+goochcaboose> good shit
[0:35:52] <SuperArson> helllllllllll yeah
[0:35:53] <+Shakespearoe> easy every time
[0:35:53] <+Keith_Chop> phase 1 on lock
[0:35:56] <Rafikator> the real boss fight
[0:36:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> oh wait what
[0:36:09] <+Robo_Wizard1> this combat arena is great
[0:36:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> phase2
[0:36:21] <Flare3500> Now time to naruto run away
[0:36:24] <Rafikator> yeah reminds me of tekken 5 burning temple
[0:36:29] <+Keith_Chop> yeah kunai when she jumps
[0:36:33] <+Keith_Chop> that'll stop her
[0:36:36] <%theluckyhero> Just run you'll be fine
[0:36:37] <+Shakespearoe> fire looks fucking good in this game
[0:36:37] <vadnhi> The Joestar secret technique...
[0:36:39] <+QuadraticGravity> the butterflies don't go through pillars.
[0:36:41] <+demonsamura> woolie you already beat this boss three years ago
[0:36:46] <SuperArson> eventually he'll probably start learning subconsciously to dodge attacks you don't get any posture out of parrying
[0:37:00] <dos_cervezas> any snap seeds?
[0:37:04] <Rafikator> no need
[0:37:08] <Ristwach> Surprisingly skilled at that secret bloodline technique LUL @vadnhi
[0:37:14] <+QuadraticGravity> @SuperArson No but you damage the boss by doing it and you're super wrong
[0:37:14] <Kojenio> killing the illusions gives you kunais, so it's worth it
[0:37:15] <+goochcaboose> RAISE YOUR SHIELD WOLLIE
[0:37:16] <$TyroneRugen> blocking is good for posture
[0:37:17] <+goochcaboose> WOOLIE
[0:37:19] <RvnWrtngdsk> Just beat Sekiro, no spoilers, just elated :)
[0:37:23] <Animedingo> holding block makes posture regain faster
[0:37:44] <Rafikator> woolie you can enemie step when they do a sweep @WoolieVersus
[0:37:47] <SuperArson> @QuadraticGravity you get more posture for dodge countering stuff like her stomp than parrying it
[0:37:47] <Tojyo> do the opposite of that jojo song and {RUN COWARDLY} from the ghosts
[0:37:48] <vadnhi> @RvnWrtngdsk Yeah, but now you need the other 3 endings, dude. :P
[0:37:54] <ElPlasa> question, can you neutral jump the unblockable ground dash?
[0:38:01] <+Shakespearoe> yes
[0:38:03] <+Shakespearoe> you should even
[0:38:05] <ElPlasa> huh
[0:38:12] <ElPlasa> imma try that then
[0:38:13] <Ristwach> So close
[0:38:13] <+Shakespearoe> if gives you an enemy step that does massive posture damage
[0:38:21] <GrayFox517> huh i didint even know that was a sweep when i fought her, that would have helped
[0:38:26] <Flare3500> Healing pills ?
[0:38:37] <+Robo_Wizard1> kill ghosts for emblems
[0:38:39] <jarednotwithsubway> Finally catching one live, FUCK THAT BITCH UP WOOLZ!!!
[0:38:39] <RvnWrtngdsk> @vadnhi Yup, can't wait (did the "best" one this time) :)
[0:38:51] <SuperArson> her sweep is pretty hard to react compared to most
[0:39:06] <Tojyo> no pellets?
[0:39:34] <FacetiousAF> yupp game looks cool, yupp game looks hard as fuck, no i don't want to spend my money on it to have a bad time being bad.
[0:39:37] <Ristwach> He's almost there
[0:39:38] <+Shastafield> Pog
[0:39:51] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Ironically Lady Butterfly was the first true boss i encountered and beat
[0:39:55] <GrayFox517> yeah i just dashed away whenever she did her crazy combo
[0:39:55] <CappuccinoGuil> Does Woolie know Guarding recovers Posture faster?
[0:39:58] <%theluckyhero> Does he know about jumping on top of people?
[0:40:01] <+Shakespearoe> but being bad at something is the first step to being sorta good at something
[0:40:03] <Flare3500> You still have a once more
[0:40:07] <GoldeNOVA> Remember your shuriken followup, Woolie
[0:40:08] <Rafikator> big match woolz
[0:40:11] <+davenofports> GHOST COMBOS
[0:40:16] <Ristwach> @CappuccinoGuil Committing to dropping his shield
[0:40:17] <SuperArson> @theluckyhero that's usually the last one new players get used to doing
[0:40:17] <Rafikator> YUN SUPER
[0:40:18] <vadnhi> Does Woolie know about G O U G I?
[0:40:20] <%FeelinNifty> does woolie know the muffin man
[0:40:24] <+天使42199> damn
[0:40:27] <+天使42199> doodOne
[0:40:28] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Remember to enemy step the sweep for massive posture damage
[0:40:29] <+QuadraticGravity> You can just use pillars as cover against the butterflies
[0:40:31] <LTKonnor> BRUH
[0:40:34] <Tojyo> these ghosts isn't a bitch huh
[0:40:34] <dos_cervezas> Snap seeds would make short work of the illusions
[0:40:35] <%theluckyhero> @SuperArson Ah ah I seee
[0:40:43] <RAH001> sekiro nascar edition

[0:41:37] <HotHungryHurricane> snap seeds are unnecessary
[0:41:42] <HotHungryHurricane> just gotta dodge to the right and dodge attack
[0:41:44] <blairINtheUSA> He is losing it
[0:41:58] <+Keith_Chop> he got this
[0:42:03] <+demonsamura> i just like saying to use the green beans

[0:42:49] <Storm_Samurai> @WoolieVersus when she snaps her fingers hide behind the pillars
[0:42:50] <+天使42199> atpQuan good try your're learning
[0:42:50] <HotHungryHurricane> pillars wreck the lock on
[0:42:51] <dos_cervezas> Throw ash in her face and run away
[0:42:51] <+Zaramoth> still a pupper, gettin snuffed
[0:42:52] <+NPCMatro> pressure her so she cant summon the ghosts
[0:42:53] <OctoBazooka> try staying behind a pillar instead
[0:42:55] <jeosadn> o kawaii koto
[0:42:56] <Tucker0603> mada mada
[0:42:56] <+Thunderhog> At that point could you have snap seeded?
[0:42:56] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, remember: guarding recovers posture faster
[0:42:56] <+hax_metatron> !uptime
[0:42:56] <umm_idunno> you can stand behind the pillars as shields
[0:42:57] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 52 minutes and 13 seconds
[0:42:57] <+darmanation6> @WoolieVersus remember shuriken are extra effective against "in the air" enemies
[0:42:57] <Rafikator> @WoolieVersus you can enemie step her on the sweep destroys her posture
[0:42:57] <Flare3500> crouch behind pillars
[0:42:58] <+Robo_Wizard1> Woolie just hang out in a corner if you don't want to fight ghosts, running blind with the camera at your back is just asking to die like that
[0:42:59] <$TyroneRugen> you can do a dropkick after you dodge a sweep!!!
[0:42:59] <+deidriel> Woolie try sidestepping attack sidestepping attack
[0:42:59] <GoldeNOVA> Actual lame attack
[0:43:02] <@SoushinSen> You can hide behind a piillar wehn the ghost become green stuff @WoolieVersus
[0:43:03] <+Verd_254> woolie, side step slash after a clean hit
[0:43:03] <+deidriel> staggers her alot
[0:43:04] <+hax_metatron> When did Woolie start
[0:43:05] <+davenofports> his youthful soul was full of s
[0:43:09] <DracaenaLeaf> Stop pulling a prometheus during every turn
[0:43:10] <+Shakespearoe> 1.) jump in on the sweeps, not away 2.) stay in in phase 2 and hide behind pillars for ghost shit
[0:43:11] <ElPlasa> shit like that is why I had to learn how to claw B and Right stick
[0:43:12] <straight_up_garbage> !uptime
[0:43:17] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Enemy step the sweep for massive posture damage
[0:43:18] <+QuadraticGravity> ....green stuff?
[0:43:19] <Tojyo> in the sweep, JUMP IN, not out
[0:43:20] <Lightraven_> I never knew she had all this stuff
[0:43:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Fighting ghosts is a very Woolie thing to do
[0:43:21] <RAH001> tried using the pillers to block the shots?
[0:43:21] <+Keith_Chop> yeah just stay away tho
[0:43:21] <GrayFox517> yeh either kill them or snap seed, they only take 1 hit
[0:43:22] <Applaudedlemon> The ghosts do give you emblems for your tool
[0:43:22] <$TyroneRugen> you can dropkick after a sweep!!!
[0:43:23] <Tojyo> you step her head
[0:43:24] <Kghaleon> can't you ignore the ghosts until she sends them flying?
[0:43:27] <OctoBazooka> go to the opposite side then
[0:43:27] <+vegabuster18> Just stay on dat Virginia
[0:43:28] <+pool_of_jello> turn the camera and you can see where she is
[0:43:28] <Rafikator> @WoolieVersus you can enemie step her on the sweep destroys her posture
[0:43:30] <Tojyo> then she get sad
[0:43:33] <+天使42199> you should really try to enemy step her
[0:43:33] <%GohanEgret> @reposted_darksouls_salt about 40 minutes or so
[0:43:38] <dos_cervezas> Woolie you have 3 snap seeds, use them to dispel ghosts
[0:43:40] <Cybermancer> I believe firecrackers are good for dispelling illusions
[0:43:40] <+ozwalldoe> @woolieversus Holding block refills your posture faster
[0:43:41] <GoldeNOVA> Remember the shuriken followup
[0:43:42] <+fizzguy47> kill those bitch ass ghosts
[0:43:42] <Flare3500> wait in one corner of the room then start running at the other end of the room @WoolieVersus
[0:43:47] <$Thorn14> What do you even get for defeating her?
[0:43:52] <+demonsamura> they arent ghosts, they are illusions
[0:43:53] <+anime_boyz> you could also just jump up and slash at her instead
[0:43:54] <Storm_Samurai> He's super close
[0:43:56] <+Keith_Chop> yeah the jumping is a bit awkward tho
[0:44:00] <+Robo_Wizard1> just don't run with the camera at your back, you have to see where the damage is going to come from to dodge
[0:44:02] <Rafikator> k k
[0:44:04] <Applaudedlemon> The ghosts give emblems for tools
[0:44:04] <+Keith_Chop> and it has a pretty slow start up
[0:44:05] <Djinnazz> A good stat for that is to just hide behind a poll
[0:44:08] <vadnhi> There *is* a place to farm more snap seeds. (Saw a rat-ninja drop a memo about it.)
[0:44:09] <$cureneckbeard> kage bunshin no jutsu
[0:44:09] <+Verd_254> side step slash after a clean hit, you can do this multiple times.
[0:44:19] <SuperArson> @WoolieVersus the stomp after her first two slashes? sidedodge and counterattack that
[0:44:20] <Rafikator> did he fight the ninja ?
[0:44:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @goochcaboose
[0:44:25] <Flare3500> so that every ghost is in that corner
[0:44:25] <umm_idunno> the less health she has the slower her posture refills
[0:44:25] <GrayFox517> you got it just trial and error
[0:44:26] <Aephol> the axe helped me on her for doing posture dmg
[0:44:26] <Rafikator> did he fight kage
[0:44:27] <Joey1995456> Do you want to know the actual cheese for this?
[0:44:30] <Kghaleon> She drops her guard whenever she attacks, so just constantly dodge and R1 to cheap it.
[0:44:34] <OctoBazooka> the ghosts drop emblems as well
[0:44:35] <%HDmexiqtioner> Have you tried not getting hit?
[0:44:36] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus You dodged every sweep, so you're reading her ok, I think
[0:44:38] <RAH001> u can use snap seed to make the illusion go away when she starts spamming it xD
[0:44:42] <%KaizenChaos> you can spam enemy step tho not only if she sweeps.
[0:44:47] <Tojyo> call billy the ninja god
[0:44:47] <dos_cervezas> use your snap seeds if the ghosts are being annoying
[0:44:47] <Applaudedlemon> @WoolieVersus The ghosts give you emblems for your tools so if you need to refill kill them
[0:44:47] <Storm_Samurai> @WoolieVersus love your headphones dude
[0:44:51] <ElPlasa> pro tip: hit her
[0:45:08] <+demonsamura> i was confused as to why they give you like one snap seed to start this fight
[0:45:14] <@SoushinSen> i'm busy grinding experience right now, so perfect time to watch stream
[0:45:15] <SuperArson> what a clean dodge
[0:45:18] <vadnhi> Pro Tip: Lower her health to 0 while keeping your own *above* 0.
[0:45:20] <+Keith_Chop> EZ phase
[0:45:22] <dos_cervezas> probably just to learn
[0:45:31] <nerdblase> What is the parry timing like for this one?
[0:45:38] <RojanBo> @woolieversus you want to hit a right angle on the butterflies when she shifts the illusions into them
[0:45:38] <+天使42199> @SoushinSen you are playing sekiro as well ?
[0:45:45] <+QuadraticGravity> @nerdblase steady and rhytmic
[0:45:45] <@SoushinSen> yes
[0:45:47] <dos_cervezas> any other bosses with similar illusion techniques? no spoilers, just yes or no please (:
[0:45:52] <+天使42199> oh cool PogChamp
[0:45:54] <Aephol> yes sorta
[0:46:00] <+Robo_Wizard1> she's meta gaming the fight and jumping specifically to fuck with your camera!
[0:46:02] <+QuadraticGravity> F, or my internet?
[0:46:08] <Slimeking_Mike> F
[0:46:08] <+天使42199> its f for me
[0:46:11] <+RenoDeGeneric> f

[0:46:21] <%juxtest> Strike her with your violence
[0:46:29] <+goochcaboose> refreshing fixes seems like
[0:46:33] <Flare3500> Good first run
[0:46:37] <SuperArson> oh nice he actually perfect deflected the axe kick
[0:46:49] <Animedingo> Round 2. FIGHT
[0:46:51] <sappinmahbinyot> Niice
[0:46:52] <ElPlasa> oh wow that was fast
[0:46:54] <+demonsamura> if she is a butterfly why does she stand on a spider web?
[0:46:55] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[0:47:13] <Tojyo> the axe is good for posture damage, sadly got a slow startup
[0:47:14] <7c_nickel> Alright Woolie, you a Wolf or you a pupper?
[0:47:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Jjnajjohnson
[0:47:19] <ElPlasa> @demonsamura because moonlight butter doesn't fly ya dingus
[0:47:21] <Flare3500> heal up
[0:47:23] <SleepyMaribo> No snap seeds?
[0:47:25] <%Noahccountingfortaste> Noahccountingfortaste subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:47:33] <+TomServal> @demonsamura Cause caterpillars also spin silk.
[0:47:37] <+demonsamura> he does fly though
[0:47:39] <Deadxxdead> is the re2 lets play on hold
[0:47:46] <Flare3500> see stick to one corner then other side
[0:47:47] <Storm_Samurai> perfect
[0:47:50] <vadnhi> Woolie is now a Pillar Man.
[0:47:50] <7c_nickel> sip
[0:47:51] <Rafikator> suprisingly skilled coward
[0:47:55] <+TheGamerMaldito> Son of an Owl!
[0:47:55] <ElPlasa> nito
[0:48:02] <+demonsamura> she isnt a caterpillar though
[0:48:02] <Ristwach> Billy help
[0:48:04] <+QuadraticGravity> Minh taking credit for chat backseating how could you
[0:48:08] <+Robo_Wizard1> with that, Woolie's got this
[0:48:16] <%CalmWeaver27> 1UPForever subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:48:27] <Tojyo> the ornstein and smough tech is real
[0:48:27] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:48:29] <GoldeNOVA> Woolie focus on those HP hallmarks mentioned in the pdf
[0:48:30] <@SoushinSen> Professional backseat gamer here.
[0:48:30] <+TomServal> True but she had to become one somehow, didn't she?
[0:48:40] <Ristwach> Jebaited
[0:48:41] <dos_cervezas> that posture gives me anxiety lol
[0:48:48] <+demonsamura> she should have lost her silk based abilities by now
[0:48:54] <Rafikator> its billay
[0:49:02] <+Zaramoth> does woolie know that the opposite of "drop your shield" applies in this game? That posture regens faster when you're blocking
[0:49:04] <Rafikator> im not used to his name yet
[0:49:12] <+TheGamerMaldito> Don't choke now woolieOMG
[0:49:18] <+demonsamura> oh i see, the silk is an illusion
[0:49:18] <ElPlasa> @Zaramoth yep
[0:49:23] <NeonBleu> now I feel dumb for running like an idiot from the homing shots
[0:49:28] <Flare3500> So that's why there are ghost left sometimes when she casts them as white stuff some are so out of range
[0:49:28] <BusterRepukken> too much hopping around
[0:49:29] <+TomServal> You're overthinking this. First she spins, then she flies, Lady Butterfly.
[0:49:35] <LazyLudens> I feel as though he jumps too much
[0:49:48] <Rafikator> nah he uses the jump fine
[0:49:52] <SuperArson> fly
[0:49:55] <SuperArson> like a butterfly
[0:49:57] <CptBritches> No, he must jump MORE. Become jumpman
[0:49:59] <PapermanXD> did he use all his snap peas?
[0:50:07] <Rafikator> Mario boi
[0:50:08] <TenWren> oh shit, finally caught one of these live
[0:50:11] <Tojyo> oh lawd she comin
[0:50:16] <+Zaramoth> does he have the followup attack after using arm specials? seems he could benefit a lot from when he shoots her down if he had that and used it
[0:50:19] <+demonsamura> man this boss is a snap
[0:50:27] <ElPlasa> Just duct tape two ninja pogo sticks to your legs brah
[0:50:27] <DeebzNutz100> Clip those wings
[0:50:53] <+demonsamura> grasshopper legs
[0:50:58] <+QuadraticGravity> @Zaramoth we're still early and remembering to jump sweeps, baby steps
[0:51:08] <ElPlasa> OH
[0:51:17] <+Robo_Wizard1> Hah, lucky
[0:51:33] <+Mcmoblin> Wait is this a rerun?
[0:51:34] <Flare3500> She so little that it's hard to jump step her
[0:51:35] <dos_cervezas> half hp and one revive left, I think he can do it
[0:51:37] <ManOfReason> yo
[0:51:37] <GobblesInTheMist> Yesssss finally got the wooLs what time is it in Canada in Aus its 11am
[0:51:37] <7c_nickel> Air hit
[0:51:39] <LazyLudens> ok he definitely jumps too much
[0:51:41] <ManOfReason> that was close
[0:51:41] <+Mcmoblin> I thought woolie beat lady butterfly?
[0:51:43] <+Zaramoth> ah i mustve gotten to her later than he then
[0:51:43] <%GohanEgret> @Mcmoblin nope
[0:51:45] <vadnhi> Lady Buttersworth.
[0:51:48] <%juxtest> Iol dodging the emblem

[0:52:17] <+Keith_Chop> RUNNN
[0:52:17] <ElPlasa> Believe in the me THAT BELIEVES IN YOU
[0:52:18] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[0:52:18] <ZimmiZ> monkaS
[0:52:19] <SuperArson> oh god
[0:52:19] <sappinmahbinyot> monkaS
[0:52:19] <+solzan2000> dont fold
[0:52:20] <7c_nickel> pills?
[0:52:21] <BusterRepukken> he literally had it if he had went in during the snap
[0:52:22] <defaultmeta> The white orbs don't actually do that much dmg
[0:52:22] <+Mcmoblin> Go for greed?
[0:52:23] <NeonBleu> throw all the shurikens at her
[0:52:25] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[0:52:28] <+demonsamura> tbh i think hes fighting this boss earlier than intended
[0:52:29] <TenWren> damn
[0:52:30] <fazoburquina> NOOOO
[0:52:31] <sappinmahbinyot> NOOOO
[0:52:31] <@Menitta> NO
[0:52:33] <Rafikator> noo
[0:52:33] <Animedingo> shoulda trusted it
[0:52:35] <NeroInfinite> almost had it
[0:52:37] <+Verd_254> all he had to do was shuriken and do the follow up slash
[0:52:37] <+Keith_Chop> shoulda trusted it
[0:52:37] <+solzan2000> NotLikeThis
[0:52:38] <Rafikator> U had it
[0:52:39] <7c_nickel> puppers in the end
[0:52:39] <+TheGamerMaldito> Mada Mada!
[0:52:40] <+daveronald> shit your pants to deter her from touching you
[0:52:41] <Tojyo> o no
[0:52:43] <TenWren> that's heartbreaking
[0:52:44] <Cybermancer> @WoolieVersus For the three hit counter she does which is kick, slash, axe kick, dodge backwards from the axe kick and do a charged attack, you'll lose less posture and get a harder counter
[0:52:45] <+Robo_Wizard1> running with the camera behind you = death
[0:52:46] <+Mcmoblin> GOOD RUN
[0:52:47] <BusterRepukken> You jump around way too much
[0:52:49] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[0:52:53] <+fizzguy47> holy shit, was that a pyscho crusher
[0:52:54] <Storm_Samurai> it did look kinda iffy
[0:52:54] <DaBelovedUnderdog> You got greedy
[0:52:58] <%theluckyhero> cheer100 tip when your below half on your life save one of those heals for that second life cause you'll end up with more hp
[0:53:00] <+Keith_Chop> ur friends are dying
[0:53:06] <Tojyo> when she that low, get in
[0:53:07] <SuperArson> the butterflies spawn based on where the illusions are, run in a circle based on their area
[0:53:09] <+demonsamura> dragonrot
[0:53:10] <Storm_Samurai> you can block the butterfly magic
[0:53:10] <+Champine> you got it this time woolz
[0:53:10] <CaptainKarite> Yeah, I just cure them when there's like 3-4
[0:53:11] <Animedingo> @tygermom they really aren't lol
[0:53:12] <+TheGamerMaldito> Woolie will figure it out! woolieSMUG
[0:53:13] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus Your health went down when you decided to go into the fray and fight the ghost for some reason
[0:53:15] <defaultmeta> Don't be too afraid of the white orbs
[0:53:17] <SuperArson> if you do that long run you'll get caught in the back
[0:53:21] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus try neutral jumping more often for the sweeps, might help
[0:53:22] <Tojyo> the little parries you do counts a lot when she is low
[0:53:23] <dos_cervezas> are you saving your snap seeds for later?
[0:53:25] <ManOfReason> NEVER STOP goinG IN
[0:53:27] <vadnhi> You're hollowing out your buddies, Woolie. :P
[0:53:34] <RojanBo> when you need.to punish midrange hold attack!
[0:53:35] <Rafikator> does he have the cure for the dragon rot
[0:53:38] <DatAsuna> Depending on your key skill you can just stun lock her with a power move
[0:53:44] <Tojyo> you no afraid of no ghost woolie
[0:53:54] <vVAstrAVv> remember woolie you can counter kick her sweeps
[0:53:55] <Tojyo> we know that since your trip
[0:53:56] <+demonsamura> the one snap seed he got from the guy or did he get more?
[0:54:10] <triklstyx> Yeah they talked about posture Regen at low healths on the podcast
[0:54:10] <+rednecked__crake> You barely get any as far as I know
[0:54:10] <ElPlasa> yikes
[0:54:11] <Storm_Samurai> OUCH
[0:54:13] <BusterRepukken> oooft
[0:54:13] <CptBritches> Fucking DESTROYED
[0:54:14] <Rafikator> shit
[0:54:15] <%xeromage> I love the Tenchu games. I appreciate you showing us this
[0:54:15] <TenWren> denied
[0:54:16] <dos_cervezas> I think he has 3
[0:54:18] <+BigBruthaThunda> omg is Woolie getting haunted?
[0:54:20] <Rafikator> DRAMATIC FINISH
[0:54:25] <vadnhi> Man, you know if Pat could get a deal for Immortality at the cost of hollowing out everyone else in he world, he'd so take it... :/
[0:54:28] <Tucker0603> ouchie
[0:54:39] <Storm_Samurai> it's ok woolie! you're learning
[0:54:40] <triklstyx> It apparently doesn't Regen at all when they're below 25%
[0:54:43] <baggysmells> The stratagy I used was to just run in circles around the room when the ghosts are out to avoid getting blind sided by her trying to kill the ghosts
[0:54:48] <+demonsamura> float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
[0:54:52] <FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus this fucking game just gets harder and harder all the way to the end... I LOVE IT
[0:54:53] <OctoBazooka> with the sweep just jump straight up instead of to the side, it gives you more time to hit her
[0:54:54] <ComptonRiot> after two clangs on her feet, she throws a kick at you like 80% of the time
[0:54:55] <Rafikator> shadows swing twice
[0:54:58] <+TheGamerMaldito> Just relax, nobody is watching º_º
[0:55:11] <+demonsamura> girls might be watching
[0:55:11] <@SoushinSen> You're doing great, better than i did. i just cheesed.
[0:55:16] <Rafikator> NICE
[0:55:17] <Storm_Samurai> i love that eureka moment when you figure out the right approach
[0:55:19] <ElPlasa> @TheGamerBendito but the girls...
[0:55:20] <FacetiousAF> there are 0 girls watching who would talk to your fiance about this performance
[0:55:20] <+fizzguy47> yo woolie, take your time
[0:55:20] <vadnhi> "Lik e the deadly Monarch butterfkly from which I take my name, I *too* have a deadly sting"...
[0:55:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You'l get it wools, this is the intended way to learn
[0:55:25] <dos_cervezas> dont know what the C was thinking
[0:55:42] <+fizzguy47> her combos are pretty predictable
[0:55:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:55:46] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Oh my God, I was watching the VoD the whole time. I am happy I caught up in time!
[0:55:49] <NeroInfinite> "but butterflys don't have stingers.."
[0:56:06] <Storm_Samurai> nice start so far
[0:56:12] <Flare3500> Good run deja vu
[0:56:14] <+DrPoxx> Whats up that old bitty going down?
[0:56:18] <mostundesired> Phase 1 is pretty EZ now, huh?
[0:56:27] <+Shakespearoe> FLAWLESS
[0:56:29] <SuperArson> flawless
[0:56:29] <ElPlasa> nice
[0:56:30] <ManOfReason> yeyeye
[0:56:30] <Rafikator> PERFECT
[0:56:31] <DracaenaLeaf> woooooow
[0:56:32] <LazyLudens> literally perfect start damn
[0:56:32] <TenWren> good shit
[0:56:35] <+demonsamura> did you know that butterflies are actually venomous?
[0:56:42] <DracaenaLeaf> now do it again!
[0:56:47] <Rafikator> How
[0:57:02] <mostundesired> She's you, but grandma-er
[0:57:06] <+demonsamura> the venom is an illusion though
[0:57:14] <ElPlasa> How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old mam
[0:57:21] <vadnhi> "i'm you, but older..."
[0:57:22] <ElPlasa> maam*
[0:57:36] <%Rawpost> fyi block refills posture quickly
[0:57:39] <Rafikator> HELL ZONE GRENADE I JUST NOTICED
[0:57:42] <Me7eors7orm> Venomous or poisonous? There's a difference
[0:57:42] <mechslayer71> Oh boy he’s still on her PogChamp
[0:57:49] <FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus push her into the corner of the room and the fight gets easier
[0:58:02] <Tojyo> she's strong because she RESPECT THE GHOSTS
[0:58:08] <+demonsamura> a poisonous rattlesnake
[0:58:14] <+TomServal> A lot of butterflies are poisonous though. They eat poisonous plants as caterpillars so predators won't eat them.
[0:58:20] <Storm_Samurai> very nice
[0:58:26] <vadnhi> She's basically Enya from Jojo. :P
[0:58:31] <theotherww> what number try is this?
[0:58:32] <$cureneckbeard> Buuuuhterfree
[0:58:39] <+Shakespearoe> or Hino-enma from Nioh
[0:58:44] <+Shakespearoe> who was also hard and annoying at first
[0:58:50] <Slimeking_Mike> Fuck her up, woolz!!!
[0:58:50] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus WE DO IT
[0:58:53] <mostundesired> PogChamp
[0:58:54] <TenWren> looking good!
[0:59:00] <ElPlasa> @vadnhi A Jojo-fied Enya
[0:59:05] <dos_cervezas> win!
[0:59:08] <+demonsamura> i beat this game but i could never bring myself to beat nioh
[0:59:12] <Me7eors7orm> Yeah monarch butterflies do for sure
[0:59:13] <Rafikator> U GOT THIS

[1:03:51] <Ristwach> tsk tsk
[1:03:52] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus Liam beat Lady Butterfly in the most gun jumping way possible
[1:03:53] <Tojyo> give that man a drink
[1:03:59] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus The English Dub is way better, IMO. Gyobu alone is worth the dub: MY NAAAAAME!
[1:04:03] <+TomServal> Woolie pinned her to the wall.
[1:04:05] <Kghaleon> Congrats, you made 1% progress
[1:04:06] <NeroInfinite> Go grind that dosh boy.
[1:04:13] <triklstyx> Is it a plothole?
[1:04:20] <+darmanation6> has he not gotten the feather arm?
[1:04:29] <$cureneckbeard> nyannTea
[1:04:33] <MayorRev> DAMN good
[1:04:35] <vadnhi> "Mm... Don't drink much... Booze makes me ornery..."
[1:04:42] <Tojyo> oh yea the feather arm
[1:04:56] <Tojyo> that naruto bullshit
[1:05:03] <+demonsamura> father seems kinda hard to use imo
[1:05:07] <alphapneumatic> how big is this dude?
[1:05:08] <+demonsamura> feather
[1:05:22] <+Keith_Chop> did he beat her?
[1:05:26] <cavefishes> @alphapneumatic like 1.5-2x sekiro's height
[1:05:26] <Flare3500> The feather jutsu is pretty cool tho you look like a Naruto
[1:05:47] <+Shakespearoe> yeah so why are there just some rteally big people in this
[1:05:52] <Tojyo> the rock lee skilltree is way more cool
[1:05:53] <+darmanation6> its not too bad since it doesnt cost if they dont hit you
[1:05:55] <+Shakespearoe> do they have souls in japan, too
[1:05:59] <7c_nickel> Shura = Asura
[1:06:05] <+demonsamura> why do all these npcs have grasshopper legs?
[1:06:10] <cham52> woolie how dare you and pat stream at the same time, i can't watch you both
[1:06:10] <Flare3500> A Shura
[1:06:14] <+DrPoxx> I want sculptor to be the final boss. doing all the ninja stuff you do but grizzled
[1:06:19] <TenWren> those were some satisfying sake drinking noises
[1:06:25] <+wardenofwinter> Isn’t Shura hatred
[1:06:31] <+TomServal> I like how this is game is more realistic of Shinobi over naruto magic. Tools have requirements instead of chakra. Practical but still hype.
[1:06:37] <Flare3500> You can also give the drink to the waifu
[1:06:54] <Ristwach> LUL
[1:06:55] <CaptainKarite> she's shy
[1:06:56] <cavefishes> give it to her
[1:06:56] <FacetiousAF> sake?! 👀
[1:06:57] <%GohanEgret> no but do it though
[1:07:03] <Aephol> basically sake gives you lore
[1:07:04] <vadnhi> @TomServal That said, there is some 100% anime magic in this game as well.
[1:07:05] <+thackattack00> I mean you could say spirit emblems are chakra
[1:07:07] <BusterRepukken> thats the tea, sis
[1:07:09] <+Mcmoblin> S-sensei
[1:07:15] <BigNerdSam> YEAH GET THE SCULPTOR TURNT
[1:07:17] <+Mcmoblin> S-sculptor-sama
[1:07:19] <Tojyo> woolie should rush for the rock lee skill tree for some good punches
[1:07:24] <vadnhi> Like the ninja puppetry art.
[1:07:25] <+Keith_Chop> drink with her
[1:07:28] <+Keith_Chop> she cool
[1:07:33] <+TomServal> @vadnhi Very true yes but it's not overly asspully.
[1:07:35] <Flare3500> make her drunk as fuck then do what most hentai do
[1:07:41] <FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus Sake is basically info juice
[1:07:48] <+Keith_Chop> dayum she dont wanna drink with you
[1:07:49] <%GohanEgret> @Flare3500 fbi open up
[1:07:53] <+Mcmoblin> She doesn't drink
[1:07:54] <CaptainKarite> if you find a different one she'll take it
[1:07:57] <+Mcmoblin> She likes tea
[1:07:59] <@Menitta> pop a madman's sake
[1:08:04] <vadnhi> It's lore-learning juice.
[1:08:08] <Papafleish> touch bobs psl
[1:08:16] <+Keith_Chop> lore juice pog
[1:08:17] <cavefishes> she'll drink other sake later
[1:08:22] <%GohanEgret> @Papafleish CoolStoryBob
[1:08:27] <jotabranded> Chat: In english, Emma's voice is the same of the bonfire ladys in Souls?
[1:08:30] <Flare3500> or make the sculptor drunk as fuck the fuck him
[1:08:30] <dos_cervezas> Emma is cute!
[1:08:42] <Tucker0603> how does Sake compare to other alcohol, cause I haven't found alcohol I like
[1:08:43] <+Sxy_T_Rex> get wasted and go bull tippin
[1:08:55] <vadnhi> @dos_cervezas Sadly, not quite as cute as your Lord... and he's a boy.
[1:09:04] <TenWren> the sculptor should fuck up your next prosthetic upgrade if you get him drunk enough
[1:09:09] <alphapneumatic> gosh be is gross
[1:09:18] <+demonsamura> how can my lord possibly be this cute?
[1:09:18] <cavefishes> @Tucker0603 there's a lot of variety in sake, there's everything from basically spirits to stuff more like wine
[1:09:28] <Tojyo> don't get him drunk he's gonna trade your shurikens for poop
[1:09:32] <%GohanEgret> this dude looks like pat after he finally lets it set in
[1:09:39] <+Keith_Chop> he kinda looks like hephaestus from God of War 3
[1:09:52] <+SpamKingRathalos> Oh god
[1:09:53] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:09:57] <vadnhi> I must mamoru my Lord. (No. Really. I must.)
[1:10:01] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @tygermom FUCK thank you I've been thinking of that for 3 days now
[1:10:03] <FackinCrazy> @tygermom holy shit your right
[1:10:18] <+commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Woolie, if you're enjoying ninjas with prosthetic arms, there's an ongoing anime adaptation of Dororo, an old Osamu Tezuka manga. Features a guy who has to kill demons to regain his limbs and senses. I'd highly recommend it!
[1:10:20] <Flare3500> What's your Taisetsu No Mono??
[1:10:34] <Tucker0603> @cavefishes anything sweet? cause I hate bitter tastes
[1:10:40] <Papafleish> woolie I am stinky nerd man but all my friends are normies how do I meet other smelly gamerz
[1:10:43] <$cureneckbeard> protect my balls
[1:10:45] <+demonsamura> that lip sync
[1:10:52] <+Keith_Chop> dont make fun of him
[1:10:58] <+Keith_Chop> he's a nice old man
[1:10:59] <+Mcmoblin> Armless hobo?
[1:11:04] <+Keith_Chop> who saved ur ass
[1:11:04] <VanLynx> he's Andre
[1:11:04] <+Mcmoblin> Wow
[1:11:06] <vadnhi> That's your future, drunken self, Woolie. :P
[1:11:08] <+Mcmoblin> He is a great guy
[1:11:10] <Leiru8> he's andre
[1:11:11] <+Thunderhog> Bet he has a hell of a Melee game
[1:11:13] <+SpamKingRathalos> Nah, Andre comes later
[1:11:14] <+seriousink> this is a game full of grungy, dirty, badasses
[1:11:16] <Flare3500> Memory up ! lore !
[1:11:16] <FackinCrazy> Shut up @WoolieVersus Dirt-chan is best waifu
[1:11:17] <+Bad1uck> Yep, they took his arms instead
[1:11:27] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> I don't know why, but the sculptor's animation of him patting you on the back after he's done working on your arm is so great
[1:11:28] <$cureneckbeard> To be fair, the protagonist is technically also a dirty armless hobo.
[1:11:39] <Tojyo> confront the mamori
[1:11:42] <baggysmells> What bosses has He beat
[1:11:42] <OctoBazooka> Thats why Wolf has a similar air takedown
[1:11:44] <Flare3500> So she's basically your foster mom
[1:11:45] <+QuadraticGravity> No, she taught YOU
[1:11:54] <+QuadraticGravity> You are Wolf, she was your teacher. :P
[1:11:56] <PA_Master> Dad hired you a tutor
[1:11:57] <cavefishes> @Tucker0603 yeah you'll want to look for ones that have a fruit or flavor on the label - i've had hana fuji apple sake that's really sweet and apple-y and also green grape sake that's real sweet and grapey
[1:11:58] <Aephol> she taught you, wolf
[1:11:58] <Slimeking_Mike> YUm Yum yum! Memories of grandma beating me up!
[1:12:02] <+fizzguy47> the boss
[1:12:05] <Tucker0603> no, she was your teacher
[1:12:09] <+Keith_Chop> she was the hot home schoool teacher
[1:12:10] <vadnhi> Ninja have kind effed-up families.
[1:12:24] <+demonsamura> shes still pretty hot tbh
[1:12:26] <mechslayer71> She was your teacher @woolieversus
[1:12:28] <Brainworm205> Woolie read bad
[1:12:31] <cavefishes> @Tucker0603 check the alcohol percentage - don't go for something with like 40% cause that'll basically be vodka haha
[1:12:32] <Flare3500> The takedown health regain is great
[1:12:44] <dos_cervezas> can I know who's the other 2 bosses be fought? gyoubu and?
[1:12:52] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> takedown health regen is a game changer
[1:12:57] <Ristwach> Your foster father assigned her as your teacher
[1:13:12] <FackinCrazy> do you think grandma and father were fuckin ?
[1:13:23] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Those are not bosses.....
[1:13:25] <Ristwach> Fight fuckin
[1:13:29] <+メセル> I fucking hate dragonrot tbh
[1:13:31] <Flare3500> You have 3 attack power so less 1 , you basically beat 2 bosses
[1:13:32] <+demonsamura> how can a wolf be raised by an owl?
[1:13:34] <+Keith_Chop> bosses give you memories
[1:13:38] <+Keith_Chop> those were mini bosses
[1:13:40] <+fizzguy47> gyoubu
[1:13:44] <CaptainKarite> Omg he is just edgier samurai jack
[1:13:45] <vadnhi> Yeah, the takedown health one is pretty essential. And it combos great with the item that lets you trade health for emblems. (The ceremonial tanto)
[1:13:47] <ElectricHoodie> there are stairs behind where you fought horse guy that lead to a dude who will give you another skill book
[1:13:54] <dos_cervezas> SeemsGood
[1:13:56] <Rafikator> did you get to the castel ? @WoolieVersus
[1:13:56] <FackinCrazy> )
[1:13:57] <sappinmahbinyot> Gotta get back
[1:14:04] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus The Shinobi are the only bosses...if you do not get a big win screen it was not a boss
[1:14:09] <Tojyo> you must defeat GHARNEF
[1:14:17] <Slimeking_Mike> Her Kunai Matata
[1:14:17] <Flare3500> No just do that mid game
[1:14:18] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> If Phil Lamar voiced Wolf for the english dub, I'd totally switch in a hearthbeat
[1:14:28] <+demonsamura> yea that guy on the horse is a shinobi

[1:18:40] <PapermanXD> Dude the longswordsmen are the best enemy in this game
[1:18:40] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus He did not have a name. You know what that means, right?
[1:18:42] <sappinmahbinyot> huh
[1:18:42] <+Bad1uck> whoa he dunked on you
[1:18:42] <DatAsuna> Woolie: "is this a boss?"

[1:18:43] <TenWren> my man hung in the air for 10 years
[1:18:45] <cavefishes> HE'S SO COOL
[1:18:47] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[1:18:51] <+duskrush> The one-armed man
[1:18:53] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus They're really weak to firecrackers
[1:18:54] <Aephol> Not even a mini boss and he beats ass
[1:18:55] <+Thunderhog> Kamen Rider Shinobi, on the scene
[1:18:56] <dos_cervezas> he must win
[1:18:58] <+Aeoneth> Sooo... You CAN bypass him and get the item he guards without having to actually face him
[1:19:03] <Tucker0603> THIS MOTHERFUCKER is REAL!
[1:19:04] <+Weeewer> You can run past him for a prosthetic @WoolieVersus
[1:19:08] <+Aeoneth> just lurre him to the back of the Pagoda
[1:19:12] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @WoolieVersus you're a braver man than I was, I NOPED off the cliff into the river so fast
[1:19:13] <CaptainKarite> YEP
[1:19:15] <+SpamKingRathalos> cheese em
[1:19:16] <+fizzguy47> this is not a coward stream
[1:19:17] <+demonsamura> why is everyone getting their left arm cut off?
[1:19:22] <unibotslicer> stealth kill em
[1:19:28] <cavefishes> yeah i ran away from that dude so hard
[1:19:30] <+SpamKingRathalos> because the left is the weaker arm
[1:19:35] <+duskrush> Because this is a prequel to Metal Gear Rising
[1:19:35] <+Order_of_Mystery> black knights!
[1:19:40] <TenWren> s y m b o l i s m
[1:19:40] <+demonsamura> the devil arm
[1:19:45] <GoldeNOVA> Firecracker his ass, I dunno.
[1:19:47] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus yo want what he's guarding
[1:19:51] <CaptainKarite> yeah that is basically the black knight
[1:19:53] <Parapattern> Purple Man
[1:19:54] <+DeepSeaMastodon> From Software hates the left arms
[1:20:07] <vadnhi> Throw your pocket sand, Woolie! :o
[1:20:10] <Flare3500> Lefties can go fuck themselves
[1:20:16] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Cross counter his legs
[1:20:17] <+SpamKingRathalos> amen to that
[1:20:23] <dos_cervezas> throw ash in his face, play dirty!
[1:20:29] <Tucker0603> firecracker this bitch
[1:20:30] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> as a left handed person, I can agree to this
[1:20:35] <+SpamKingRathalos> Pull some Joseph Joestar on em
[1:20:42] <+Bad1uck> lefties are the inferior 25% of the population
[1:20:45] <Tojyo> kill it with FIRE
[1:20:45] <FackinCrazy> Spy cheesed this guy by falling off the edge and coming back up and sneak attacking him
[1:20:45] <Ristwach> Is that a lunge?
[1:20:48] <cavefishes> PARRY WORKS
[1:20:49] <BusterRepukken> get SCHUM'D
[1:20:54] <SixthSun2> Blocking is always the answer
[1:20:54] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Remember that spear counter?
[1:20:56] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> left handed, also known as wrong handed
[1:20:59] <+duskrush> As a head's up you can counter his front kick. It counts as a thrust
[1:21:10] <OBS_VinnieK> ohhh the purple dude
[1:21:10] <+Bad1uck> There's a reason lefties are called sinistrals
[1:21:11] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> you can Mikiri that?!
[1:21:14] <mechslayer71> You can mikiri the thrust kick @woolieversus
[1:21:14] <+MrDuckles> Throw a shuriken when he jumps into the air
[1:21:15] <Rellim80> Missing your left arm has significant meaning with regards to the Budda and the only disciple he ever took.
[1:21:21] <Tucker0603> firecracker this bitch
[1:21:25] <Me7eors7orm> Sinister, not 'wrong'
[1:21:28] <Flare3500> You can Mikiri counter almost any thrust attack
[1:21:29] <dos_cervezas> mikiri counter his kick
[1:21:36] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Mirikiri is op Kreygasm
[1:21:43] <Cymen90> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll Yup, all kicks like that
[1:21:45] <+duskrush> There's thrust and sweep
[1:21:53] <SuperArson> he has no grabs so it's only either sweep or thrust
[1:21:53] <+SpamKingRathalos> kicks are the best
[1:21:54] <+demonsamura> sweep the leg
[1:22:05] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @Cymen90 that's some good tech to know!
[1:22:05] <Cymen90> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll All unblockables have an answer.
[1:22:08] <Flare3500> You're out of chakra no firecrackers
[1:22:16] <vadnhi> @demonsamura "Yes, Sensei..."
[1:22:18] <%theluckyhero> Won't like I just ran past his ass
[1:22:31] <+duskrush> He does the thrust kick at the end of that crazy-ass flury kick
[1:22:41] <+duskrush> flurry*
[1:22:46] <nerdblase> The big question I've got is how you just went toe to toe with Lady Butterfly for like an hour yet this brand new chump is giving you the business right quick?
[1:23:08] <+Bad1uck> he just said "no healing in my dojo"
[1:23:10] <GoldeNOVA> Firecracker works?
[1:23:10] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus if I remember correctly I think firecrackers work on this guy
[1:23:13] <+SpamKingRathalos> This guy got the happy feet.
[1:23:17] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Grimace aint no joke
[1:23:18] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @nerdblase don't knock this chump, he ain't fucking around
[1:23:22] <Tojyo> put your leg on his leg
[1:23:26] <borkmire> pats close to the end but I'm going fucking apatHoldon woolieOMG is streamin right now.
[1:23:27] <+duskrush> Do they work on him because this guy is a BEAST?
[1:23:38] <+Order_of_Mystery> firecrackers are op
[1:23:40] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Tap dancing all over woolie senpai
[1:23:42] <Parapattern> "Ahh! I'm scared!"
[1:23:53] <GoldeNOVA> You can gring spirit emblems
[1:23:58] <FackinCrazy> I bet there's gonna be bell dlc
[1:23:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:24:04] <vadnhi> Did anyone follow that series that focused on the life of Johnny years later after his loss to Daniel?
[1:24:09] <Flare3500> how much does spirit emblems cost right now ? because if it's 10 might as well buy as much as you can because the cost increases to 50 later
[1:24:14] <GoldeNOVA> Spirit emblems are like bullets on Bloodborne
[1:24:20] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus fair enough
[1:24:25] <FacetiousAF> let me be the 8th person in this chat to say the word "artorias"
[1:24:28] <Tojyo> he's saving for the kunai upgrade?
[1:24:29] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Vaati's early game farm did wonders for me
[1:24:31] <ComptonRiot> you can parry those big air dropkicks
[1:24:34] <+Bad1uck> @vadnhi the TV series on some streaming site?
[1:24:35] <+duskrush> There ya go!
[1:24:35] <Cymen90> YEYE
[1:24:41] <Tojyo> he is way far to get the rest of the materials
[1:24:46] <BigChiefBear> just sneak attack him kappa
[1:24:47] <vadnhi> @Bad1uck That's the one.
[1:24:53] <Tucker0603> yeyeyeyeyey
[1:24:58] <+demonsamura> can you do the blood bullet thing in this game? i thought i saw lobos do it once
[1:25:13] <+SpamKingRathalos> noooo
[1:25:13] <Cymen90> NOOOO
[1:25:17] <Aephol> AAAAA
[1:25:17] <unibotslicer> NOOO
[1:25:20] <Flare3500> @demonsamura you need to get an item to conver your health to spirit emblems
[1:25:20] <%theluckyhero> Waaaaait a second
[1:25:20] <BlkFlameKami> oof
[1:25:21] <+SpamKingRathalos> NOOOOOO
[1:25:24] <+Shakespearoe> OH NOO
[1:25:24] <+pool_of_jello> damn
[1:25:25] <nickthenoboody> so close man
[1:25:27] <+duskrush> Nah you did pretty good that time
[1:25:27] <Cymen90> CHOKE

[1:25:29] <OctoBazooka> oh boy did you
[1:25:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This guy is fucking hard
[1:25:32] <+lucaflowe> WHOOLIE
[1:25:32] <fazoburquina> You can do it woolie
[1:25:32] <vadnhi> @demonsamura There is an item (a ceremonial tanto) that will let you trade half your health for 5 emblems
[1:25:33] <%GraceTBM> Then you still need the practice
[1:25:38] <+demonsamura> oh i must have missed it
[1:25:38] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Purple brought the nurple
[1:25:38] <prime_name> You were in mid-combo, it cool.
[1:25:41] <dos_cervezas> hahaha
[1:25:42] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> oh god my heart
[1:25:47] <OctoBazooka> but you got it now
[1:25:50] <dos_cervezas> I know that feel
[1:25:50] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> That choke :(
[1:25:51] <+SpamKingRathalos> what a tease
[1:25:53] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[1:26:00] <+duskrush> The weird thing about the counter is that it forces you to dodge toward the danger and that's against everything bloodborne taught you
[1:26:03] <Flare3500> They tease like one of them hentais
[1:26:06] <+Bad1uck> I just saw the trailers. I can't imagine a show about washed up martial artists played by washed up actors
[1:26:11] <BigChiefBear> @woolieversus just sneak attack him
[1:26:14] <+DeepSeaMastodon> Oh snap...Woolie no...
[1:26:14] <+Bad1uck> is any good
[1:26:19] <@SoushinSen> F
[1:26:29] <+demonsamura> this isnt even his final form
[1:26:30] <GoldeNOVA> You're respecting him too much
[1:26:31] <@SoushinSen> oh, it's just me, i guess
[1:26:44] <%theluckyhero> you found the number in the phone book and kept turning
[1:26:44] <+SpamKingRathalos> This guy demands respect tbh
[1:27:05] <kerotuyu> Is this Fromsoftware Auron?
[1:27:07] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> he might be better off deflecting that super jump kick, would probably do a good bit of poise damage
[1:27:09] <+Mcmoblin> Oh wait I remember this guy, I saw him in another part of the game
[1:27:10] <Cymen90> Makiri Counter :)
[1:27:13] <Tojyo> this game has way 2 many "avoid dmg" buttons is hard as fuck
[1:27:15] <+DeepSeaMastodon> No respect just punchdad him in the face and be done with it
[1:27:17] <@SoushinSen> @BigChiefBear how do you sneak attack him? he's on the rooftop watching the stairs.
[1:27:20] <vadnhi> Seriously @WoolieVersus ... Just throw some ash in his eyes and then run up and grab the item from the pagoda. ;P
[1:27:22] <+demonsamura> hard to respect a man that lost his left arm in a training accident
[1:27:31] <BigChiefBear> @woolieversus green candy and backstabuuuuu
[1:27:31] <+duskrush> probably with the sneaking candy
[1:27:33] <%GraceTBM> Wow, those damage proportions seem to really scream "Just do it perfect, don't heal"
[1:27:34] <+hax_metatron> Just stealth him LUL
[1:27:39] <+Bad1uck> He's committed now
[1:27:40] <%juxtest> Dont forget the Mikiri Dont Get Hit either
[1:27:45] <Tucker0603> @soushinsen leave after you trigger him
[1:27:46] <Cymen90> SO COOL
[1:27:49] <+SpamKingRathalos> He lost his arm, but in return he gained feet.
[1:27:55] <nickthenoboody> try doing the jump kick to do a ton of posture damage
[1:27:58] <+SpamKingRathalos> Look at those sick ass kicks
[1:27:58] <+demonsamura> this ememy can not be stealthed as far as i know
[1:27:59] <+Bad1uck> It's a matter of pride doing it the hard way
[1:28:02] <+thackattack00> you might be able to use a stealth candy to sneak up on him
[1:28:06] <+duskrush> I love how cinematic fights in this game are and it's all based on your own skill
[1:28:08] <+thackattack00> they're really powerful
[1:28:13] <+QuadraticGravity> DAMN one hit off
[1:28:15] <Flare3500> Close but no cigar
[1:28:33] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @duskrush every single fight too, it's amazing
[1:28:33] <Tucker0603> close
[1:28:36] <+thackattack00> he does seem kinda scripted to notice you tho
[1:28:53] <dos_cervezas> yeah I think you cant sneak this guy
[1:28:56] <+hax_metatron> All bosses and enemies of this game are 💯
[1:28:56] <+duskrush> I want a hand to hand melee game with this type of parry and attack system
[1:28:58] <TenWren> he's got a high vantage point
[1:28:59] <dos_cervezas> not yet anyway
[1:29:01] <+Sxy_T_Rex> just poison his drinking water
[1:29:02] <+Bad1uck> Woolie is looking at this as a Samurai would when he should be playing as an honorless ninja using every trick in the book
[1:29:03] <+duskrush> It would look sick
[1:29:05] <mechslayer71> There’s a way worse version of him later @woolieversus
[1:29:15] <+demonsamura> that wall hopping animation though
[1:29:18] <+hax_metatron> @duskrush wait for a later level
[1:29:26] <vadnhi> Ironically, the item this guy is guarding would *allow* you to stealth him. :p
[1:29:42] <Aephol> Cinematic af
[1:29:42] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> YO
[1:29:43] <+demonsamura> how?

[1:30:22] <Flare3500> Get the Naruto Shit Woolie !!! can be a Naruto now !
[1:30:24] <dos_cervezas> I'll see 4 of you later in the game! (;
[1:30:24] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Gg ez
[1:30:27] <+skylaryeah> now you get the most fun prosthetic
[1:30:33] <+demonsamura> i keep seeing you have to be neutral to do the counter but you can actually dodge into it
[1:30:38] <%RioGascar> So uh dont mean to make the victory all for naught
[1:30:42] <%RioGascar> you can just open the door
[1:30:45] <+Weeewer> Can this tool dodge unblockables? I havent tried it yet
[1:30:51] <+Weeewer> It seemed bad, but if it can...
[1:30:53] <%RioGascar> and you have invincibility frames
[1:30:53] <+QuadraticGravity> @Weeewer yes
[1:30:53] <+duskrush> It's a 100% dodge
[1:30:54] <+Order_of_Mystery> substitution jutsu!
[1:30:57] <+BigBruthaThunda> Pat is getting gunned down by old men
[1:30:59] <Tucker0603> you ready for trickster? @woolieversus
[1:30:59] <alexandrecau> substitution jutsu
[1:31:00] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:31:03] <Sir_Carl> Table Hopper!!
[1:31:04] <Flare3500> Log replacement Jutsu
[1:31:06] <+Sxy_T_Rex> the perfect weapon to seduce strong samurai
[1:31:08] <+Weeewer> Would be useful against a certain boss I fought with huge unblockables
[1:31:08] <mechslayer71> There’s a way worse version with 2 health bars in a small ass arena later @woolieversus
[1:31:11] <+C0baltCrusade> TRICK!
[1:31:16] <dos_cervezas> Ground Trick
[1:31:17] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus It is feathers that can be TURNED into a tool
[1:31:20] <cavefishes> idol home
[1:31:22] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Sand jitsu
[1:31:23] <bleugh> weird description in a from software game..? no...
[1:31:23] <@SoushinSen> @WoolieVersus You did better than me. I died 20 times and got tired, so I just took this item during combat and escaped into water like a coward.
[1:31:31] <+Weeewer> every tool is good imo
[1:31:31] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus it's Trick
[1:31:35] <+Weeewer> Ive found use for all of them
[1:31:35] <+duskrush> It's pretty useful for enemies with a lot of unblockables
[1:31:42] <Flare3500> @SoushinSen That's the true Naruto way
[1:31:43] <Ristwach> Can you trick out of grabs?
[1:31:48] <%RioGascar> but yeah i just grabbed the item and ran away
[1:31:49] <vadnhi> It's almost like you're expected to do a whole bunch of classic ninja BS in this game or something. ;P
[1:31:50] <Tojyo> you firecrack a big mob of enemies
[1:31:53] <Tojyo> so good
[1:31:59] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> I'm pretty sure every single tool is used to exploit at least 1 weakness, they're all amazing
[1:32:02] <+C0baltCrusade> we already have royalguard, swordmaster, and now we have trickster
[1:32:03] <%RioGascar> I came back after beating grandma
[1:32:09] <kappamutton> oh so minh actually bought it
[1:32:10] <Flare3500> Firecrackers is effective to but not limited : EVERYONE
[1:32:12] <+sleepy_pink> firecracker tends to spook animals
[1:32:15] <%juxtest> Firecrackers work well on the horse guy
[1:32:16] <+hax_metatron> Once you get the poison cheese knife then you’re a true ninja. Sabimaru Kappa
[1:32:18] <+demonsamura> i found the spear enemies super easy
[1:32:21] <+Order_of_Mystery> you can even use the feathers to bypass a certain snek
[1:32:28] <+Weeewer> Fire cracker is really good for general enemies
[1:32:29] <vadnhi> Firecrackers almost *always* spook animals.
[1:32:32] <+Weeewer> Good to close out an encounter
[1:32:39] <+Weeewer> And since enemies give spirit emblems it aint bad
[1:32:39] <Tojyo> sabimaru is THE SHIT
[1:32:41] <mechslayer71> There’s an Uber needed version in a small arena later @woolieversus
[1:32:42] <+thackattack00> only tool i havent had much use for is the spear. i found like 1 guy with armor
[1:32:43] <Flare3500> Naruto !
[1:32:47] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Replacement Jutsu!
[1:32:48] <mechslayer71> Beefed*
[1:32:53] <+egalitarian696969> it gets you a sick punish tho
[1:32:59] <+Weeewer> Reminder that Spirit Emblems arent money, you get a bunch for just killing
[1:32:59] <Tojyo> you combo the shit out of everything with that
[1:33:02] <%GraceTBM> So they combined Faust and trickster?
[1:33:03] <PE4X> its great if upgraded
[1:33:03] <bleugh> that dodge is money
[1:33:03] <GoldeNOVA> Just like Itachi
[1:33:03] <Flare3500> Try it on training dummy
[1:33:05] <+Weeewer> So its a dodge that costs a resource from kills
[1:33:21] <+duskrush> @WoolieVersus it's good when you want that free hit though
[1:33:23] <+Weeewer> Spirit Emblem is energy basically
[1:33:25] <Ristwach> Yeyeyeye training dummy
[1:33:28] <+Weeewer> you dont HAVE to get it with money
[1:33:30] <cavefishes> you can attack out of it with prothetic skills
[1:33:47] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus but it's a kickass Dodge that's 100% invincible and repositions you
[1:33:54] <+Keith_Chop> ITS GOOD
[1:33:59] <Aephol> It stuns
[1:34:01] <+Keith_Chop> Really good
[1:34:03] <+Weeewer> its a free stun...
[1:34:03] <+Keith_Chop> it stuns
[1:34:05] <+demonsamura> its spring-loaded!
[1:34:07] <+Mcmoblin> Stuns pretty well
[1:34:07] <cavefishes> long free stun
[1:34:08] <Tojyo> to fire that CRACK
[1:34:10] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus It's the best it stuns people and get free damage , or you can use it to heal
[1:34:11] <+Order_of_Mystery> its an aoe stun, dude!!
[1:34:12] <Ristwach> Stuns for free hits
[1:34:18] <+Mcmoblin> It's a universal stun that does LONGER stun than fire
[1:34:21] <1tsblt> it makes sparkles , everyone loves sparkles no1WOW
[1:34:24] <Flare3500> It's get out of jail card
[1:34:25] <+Weeewer> Stronger
[1:34:29] <Djinnazz> i'm back, did we beat her?
[1:34:32] <+demonsamura> add a spring to your firecrackers
[1:34:33] <+Keith_Chop> yeah a lot better
[1:34:37] <Lieutori> Also deals tons of posture on beasts
[1:34:39] <+duskrush> I wish they'd called it pocket sand
[1:34:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> its solar flare from dbz
[1:34:41] <vadnhi> It;s the 4th of July everyday, now, boiz. :P
[1:34:41] <+Shastafield> better pocket sand
[1:34:46] <+Keith_Chop> its super usefull
[1:34:51] <+Weeewer> r o t a t i o n a l
[1:34:52] <Videogamer4> it's better because it can stun bosses too @woolieversus
[1:34:56] <+Keith_Chop> essentially pocket sand yes
[1:34:58] <+Weeewer> Its Part 7
[1:35:00] <+C0baltCrusade> the golden rotation?!
[1:35:03] <+Weeewer> You become Gyro
[1:35:03] <Slimeking_Mike> ROTATIONAL ENERGY
[1:35:09] <+duskrush> yes you can
[1:35:09] <CaptainKarite> Ball Breaker!!
[1:35:10] <OctoBazooka> Yes
[1:35:11] <%GraceTBM> TeraMercier subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Is there any real point in using Breakaway in DMC 5 instead of a super, other than a faster arm change?
[1:35:12] <+Weeewer> yes
[1:35:13] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> yes
[1:35:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> yes
[1:35:14] <+pool_of_jello> yes
[1:35:14] <+Keith_Chop> yes
[1:35:15] <+Order_of_Mystery> especially againt animals...
[1:35:15] <NeroInfinite> yes
[1:35:15] <Djinnazz> yup
[1:35:16] <+demonsamura> i literally never used the firecrackers
[1:35:16] <%Kisabuza> Hey woolie woolz. Is sekiro worth comparing to ni-oh or is it just a different experience entirely
[1:35:16] <+C0baltCrusade> ARIGATOU
[1:35:19] <+Weeewer> its a 1->2 upgrade
[1:35:22] <+Aeoneth> yes you can
[1:35:24] <Tucker0603> yes
[1:35:26] <Tojyo> yea it does
[1:35:28] <+thackattack00> long spark is really good
[1:35:29] <Aephol> It's a straigt upgrade with no downside
[1:35:40] <+Sxy_T_Rex> very powerful especially against living beings
[1:35:41] <+Weeewer> you can trust us
[1:35:44] <+leyk36> firecrackers are super useful for beast type enemies
[1:35:48] <+Aeoneth> cuz you don't own it yet
[1:35:50] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus loaded shuriken just means all shuriken types
[1:35:54] <+Keith_Chop> trust us
[1:36:01] <cavefishes> it's literally the same weapon for combo purposes
[1:36:02] <Tojyo> you can woolie BELIEVE IT
[1:36:02] <+Weeewer> for once chat is right
[1:36:02] <+skylaryeah> loaded shuriken sounts as all upgraded versions
[1:36:03] <Flare3500> chasing slice works on every shuriken prosthetic
[1:36:05] <+Keith_Chop> fuck the description
[1:36:07] <mechslayer71> You don’t own it FailFish @woolieversus
[1:36:07] <+hax_metatron> Just try it DansGame
[1:36:10] <%RioGascar> Anyone know if you go in training against dummy san and if it doesnt use your spirit emblems
[1:36:17] <mechslayer71> WHY WOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT
[1:36:22] <Tojyo> in theory is the same prosthetic
[1:36:24] <+Weeewer> i mean it might
[1:36:28] <+Weeewer> but in this case its not different
[1:36:29] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus it's just a straight up upgrade, you can use the regular throw or a charged throw
[1:36:33] <OctoBazooka> tap for regular, hold for spin
[1:36:33] <+demonsamura> i always never use secondary weapons in games or timed buffs
[1:36:35] <Flare3500> @RioGascar It cost spirit emblems even fighting against training dummy
[1:36:35] <@SoushinSen> @WoolieVersus equippingthe spinning shuriken can still throw normal shuriken. you press R2 for normal shuriken. hold R2 to throw spinning shuriken
[1:36:35] <Tucker0603> it's more options
[1:36:59] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus it does work with the charge version, the timing is just odd
[1:37:09] <+duskrush> You just get a charge throw
[1:37:25] <+Link232> You'll get sidegrades eventually
[1:37:26] <+Weeewer> no idea
[1:37:27] <Tetsu_TIW> some items change how the prosthetics behave
[1:37:27] <cavefishes> options down the line do different things
[1:37:30] <+thackattack00> they're the same though
[1:37:31] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus when looking at the arms press Y/triangle for the combo or information
[1:37:32] <+Keith_Chop> cause some of the later upgrades are different
[1:37:34] <$cureneckbeard> Spinning, that's a good trick
[1:37:37] <Rockgagong> did we beat the old lady?
[1:37:38] <+C0baltCrusade> OPTIONSELECTS PogChamp
[1:37:39] <+duskrush> just in case you want to do a no spin run I guess?
[1:37:41] <+Aeoneth> I think for some it ends up costing more so the option to downgrade is available
[1:37:41] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> if you want to go back to a different version, some upgrades completely change how it works entirely, so you might not want to use it and switch back
[1:37:42] <+Weeewer> Lesson 5, Woolie!!
[1:37:43] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus because From Software
[1:37:44] <Lieutori> Some upgrades have different benefits and costs
[1:37:47] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus Some later versions cost more emblems, so they give the option the use eariler ones if you want
[1:37:48] <Tojyo> because you have the option to downgrade yourself
[1:37:48] <+Keith_Chop> its just more options
[1:37:49] <+Mcmoblin> @Rockgagong yup
[1:37:51] <+Aeoneth> liek costing more spirit emblems to use
[1:37:52] <+DrPoxx> Using the golden spiral?
[1:37:53] <+demonsamura> this is the no spin zone
[1:37:54] <+Order_of_Mystery> sidegrades down the line, woolz
[1:37:58] <Djinnazz> ther'e further upgrades that are good for diff situations, and some that arent't so you can switch back and forth.
[1:38:07] <Rockgagong> apatDab apatDab I left for a bit, and paid for it
[1:38:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:38:13] <+Weeewer> is woolie uploading these as vods?
[1:38:19] <+C0baltCrusade> apatDab
[1:38:20] <+Weeewer> Does he do vods? Ive seen mostly lps
[1:38:20] <CaptainKarite> I don't think he gets any more
[1:38:34] <FackinCrazy> The flame vent is great for doing some early chip damage on bosses
[1:38:35] <+Order_of_Mystery> !MOTIVATED
[1:38:35] <@Moobot> 292 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:38:36] <Tucker0603> @weeewer no
[1:38:42] <Flare3500> Time to go to the castle
[1:38:47] <+Weeewer> Charged Flame vent is nuts
[1:38:47] <%GohanEgret> @Weeewer he does edited "best ofs" for youtube, vods on twitch
[1:38:51] <+demonsamura> hes uploading the RE2 steam VERY SLOWLY
[1:38:52] <+Weeewer> On normal enemies especially
[1:38:59] <+Weeewer> kk cool stuff
[1:39:00] <%RioGascar> just gonna point out woolie when your on the arms menu you can press triangle to see the combo you can do with those arms
[1:39:16] <%Kisabuza> no fashion souls huh
[1:39:16] <Tojyo> did you get the shop fom the gate?
[1:39:19] <+hax_metatron> He knows
[1:39:21] <%Kisabuza> fashion dies twice
[1:39:23] <Spoofy16> you enjoying the game so far. just tuned in
[1:39:27] <+hax_metatron> Go find Tengu tho
[1:39:30] <+Mcmoblin> Are you still doing boxing training?
[1:39:36] <Ristwach> Break time?
[1:39:43] <+demonsamura> racist gohan
[1:39:49] <dos_cervezas> He didnt talk to Tengu?
[1:39:49] <%GohanEgret> nice
[1:40:07] <%GarbageNirvana> It says barbecue grill
[1:40:08] <%GohanEgret> @demonsamura it's just gohan and egret like from ZOE2 BibleThump
[1:40:11] <shotgang86> Woorie verusus
[1:40:12] <+LeroyOctopus> @WoolieVersus do you think you should upload a bunch of fortnite and apex videos in order to get to 1 million subs to drive the megabots mech?
[1:40:16] <dos_cervezas> Tengu is the opposite path of Ashina Gate, talk to him and get a prayer bead there
[1:40:18] <vadnhi> "I'm just saying man, this city would be a lot better if we swept out those Al-Bheds out of their ghettos, man..."
[1:40:22] <+demonsamura> sounded like something else to me
[1:40:57] <OctoBazooka> its a great feeling
[1:41:03] <+demonsamura> is that an eagle?
[1:41:07] <+Bad1uck> Yes, remove the curse of the elderly
[1:41:07] <%RioGascar> i would say i didnt learn so much as never stopped being aggressive
[1:41:09] <+Order_of_Mystery> woolie won against that ninja super hard
[1:41:09] <Flare3500> Most people I see on twitter hate the game
[1:41:30] <+Weeewer> hes right
[1:41:33] <+Weeewer> you end up with full
[1:41:36] <%RioGascar> i have gotten to the end (at least i think it is) by just being so aggressive
[1:41:37] <QaizerArt> Yo Woolie, when you beat the final boss, check Pat's stream of it from right now. He just pulled off some FUCKING SHIT.
[1:41:40] <+demonsamura> a lot of ppl are calling the game bad because they cant git gud
[1:42:00] <SixthSun2> VaatiVidya's new Sekiro video helps explain a lot of mechanics
[1:42:03] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus yeah saving 1 for your last rez is good because it lets you get all your hp back for the Posture regen
[1:42:04] <Flare3500> I finished it twice already it's so much fun
[1:42:07] <Ristwach> Dororo is fucking dope!
[1:42:13] <Tucker0603> @qaizerart I'm gonna have to try that out later
[1:42:14] <+demonsamura> but im betting there will be an easy mode mod soon
[1:42:21] <townzzzzz> blood will tell
[1:42:26] <+egalitarian696969> Finally a stream that isn't 14 hours ahead of me because they got the game a day early.
[1:42:27] <+paladinstarbuster> The party is over
[1:42:31] <+Order_of_Mystery> Dororo is dodope!
[1:42:35] <dos_cervezas> I think the best part is that the game is purely single player so you cant even ask for help, every victory is earned, underhandedly or not!
[1:42:41] <+Bad1uck> @demonsamura They did the same with Dark Souls 2, which is now looked fondly upon once purple got good
[1:42:42] <+paladinstarbuster> but i still wanna dance
[1:42:43] <QaizerArt> @Tucker0603 Pat did an amazing block that I'm not sure many could.
[1:42:48] <%RioGascar> I think woolie did get it a day early
[1:43:02] <QaizerArt> If him and fucking Woolie weren't stylebeasts
[1:43:07] <mr_sups> ONLY the most fucked up
[1:43:13] <@Menitta> lol
[1:43:14] <+demonsamura> DS2 wasnt even that hard
[1:43:32] <%RioGascar> Do you have to woolie
[1:43:39] <Ristwach> LUL
[1:43:43] <@Menitta> Ha thats good
[1:43:44] <Ristwach> It's just CP
[1:43:50] <%RioGascar> also i doubt they would ban. porns on twitter for all over the place
[1:43:51] <@Menitta> OH YOU!
[1:44:07] <%RioGascar> Wait cp...okay
[1:44:08] <+Bad1uck> It wasn't hard, but it requires a different playstyle than DS1
[1:44:12] <%RioGascar> they would ban for that
[1:44:17] <mr_sups> Thanks Woolie! Glad they make you laugh.
[1:44:17] <+demonsamura> oh
[1:44:25] <+demonsamura> i played DS2 first so
[1:45:02] <%RioGascar> I thought it was a way to get out a long animation. like geberas laser
[1:45:07] <+paladinstarbuster> you can use it to parry i believe
[1:45:17] <RealPT1> breakaway is basically a burst
[1:45:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:45:21] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus How many anal beads do you have??
[1:45:30] <+Bad1uck> Yeah, you missed the nostalgia shitstorm upon launch then
[1:45:32] <%DeRedBaron> unless you're doing combo MADs, odds are it will be mostly a quick change in situations where you NEED teh arm but mostly breakage is more worth
[1:45:32] <bunnykingrules> anyone here know if the power ranger fighting game is any good?
[1:46:00] <+Order_of_Mystery> ds2 is way better than its given credit for. powerstancing is awesome, and shouldve been in ds3!
[1:46:06] <+天使42199> the power ranger fighter isnt out is it ?
[1:46:13] <bunnykingrules> out today
[1:46:18] <+WorldsBestPanda> "boy"
[1:46:19] <+demonsamura> so did you see that vampire bloodlines is getting a sequel out of nowhere
[1:46:20] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @Order_of_Mystery I'm still pissed to this day that they got rid of power stancing
[1:46:31] <+demonsamura> and they want you to preorder a year before launch
[1:46:33] <+天使42199> today wow didnt know
[1:46:46] <%RioGascar> oh look those badasses you been kickijgntheir ass
[1:46:51] <%RioGascar> Someone took em out

[1:47:24] <%Itselguapo> pogonaHenlo wooliewoolz
[1:47:30] <hopsoverfrogs> this should've been a chewie and fuckface LP!!!!
[1:47:35] <Parapattern> That's a pretty shitty paradise
[1:47:35] <Flare3500> That's a different person I think , i mean they have different things for sale
[1:47:36] <+Bad1uck> @order_of_mystery yep DS2 had so many improvements and innovations. SotFS just gave the game the polish it needed
[1:47:56] <+Orenjevel> Just joining in. Is this Irythyll of the boreal valley?
[1:47:57] <%RioGascar> love does bloom on the battlefield after all
[1:47:58] <+demonsamura> they are all different guys as far as i know
[1:48:17] <+Bad1uck> Is he clipping through the tent fabric texture?
[1:48:19] <Slimeking_Mike> Ds2 is theoretically a great game; if only it was actually fun
[1:48:19] <%hex_doll> ehtheir subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:48:33] <Flare3500> 10% Investment
[1:48:39] <+demonsamura> i had fun with DS2 :(

[1:52:57] <Flare3500> One-Armed Wolf = Sekiro TITLE DROP
[1:52:57] <0rond> @WoolieVersus theyt had to disable your weapon in this area because they knew people would just swing at him before he finished talking
[1:53:00] <+paladinstarbuster> TITLE DROP
[1:53:01] <SixthSun2> Just because he put his weapon away, doesnt' mean he can't attack at a moment's notice
[1:53:04] <ElectricHoodie> hi new dad

[1:53:24] <$cureneckbeard> tengu
[1:53:27] <%Nomad_Scholar> don't forget Batujutsu
[1:53:29] <gremoirhirst> "I'm going to kill you! Oh but I like your arm. I shall call you Cuddles! Lets go do things together"
[1:53:32] <Flare3500> we really are The Final Fantasy
[1:53:38] <arkv01> DOUJA
[1:53:45] <Zayasu> I cant believe people play this in english :(
[1:53:45] <+demonsamura> i like your no arm
[1:53:47] <arkv01> its rat boys time
[1:53:49] <+paladinstarbuster> Nice camera work woolz
[1:53:51] <caja_de_ojos> so the title is a statement
[1:53:52] <%KenReels> KenReels subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:53:52] <%DeRedBaron> The fun thing is, that is supposed to be the only title but the Shadows Die Twice line was a tagline that was good that they kept it
[1:53:57] <%RioGascar> Do it
[1:53:59] <TenWren> stood up, named you, said let's kill shit
[1:54:02] <arkv01> he's STILL flexing
[1:54:02] <+Sxy_T_Rex> kick his ass
[1:54:05] <+Aeoneth> Because he's standing on the corpse of the ninja's that just fucked you up
[1:54:05] <arkv01> DOUJA
[1:54:06] <Slimeking_Mike> Tengu RULES
[1:54:07] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> "After all those rockets, there was nothing left of him but a pile of Twisted Metal."
[1:54:10] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> that one purple jobber you struggled with and he killed like SIX
[1:54:16] <Tucker0603> @reiju_22 to be fair, his English voice actor is the best
[1:54:21] <GoldeNOVA> Go kill some rats!
[1:54:31] <BlkFlameKami> YOSH
[1:54:32] <%RioGascar> he killed like 4 of them
[1:54:34] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @arkv01
[1:54:37] <%RioGascar> you killed 1
[1:54:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> friendship ended with everyone else; now Tengu is my new friend!
[1:54:45] <vadnhi> The "rats" he's referencing are the potato-ninja guys. :P
[1:54:47] <+demonsamura> i feel more connected to dialog i can understand
[1:54:49] <%RioGascar> And it was hard as shit
[1:54:50] <The_Sorrow_> 🐀
[1:54:51] <+Weeewer> This side quest is EXTRAMELY good
[1:54:51] <SilverInferno3> I don't know why I expected actual rats
[1:55:04] <MForan98> quest time boi
[1:55:04] <+Orenjevel> rats. We're rats. We're the rats.
[1:55:05] <%Nomad_Scholar> Fear your enemies sheathing their swords in the middle of combat
[1:55:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's way more appropriate than you think
[1:55:11] <Flare3500> Sekiro's sounds like Yasuo
[1:55:11] <+Sxy_T_Rex> so purple guy was just a costume full of rats?
[1:55:15] <Videogamer4> do this you get skills you NEED
[1:55:16] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> "What is this mansion? Some kind of Resident Evil?"
[1:55:19] <mechslayer71> @weeewer The skill tree you get is godlike
[1:55:21] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus kill the Pat clan

[1:56:01] <vadnhi> Just on the other side of the battlefield, I think.
[1:56:02] <@SoushinSen> I killed all the rats before i even met him, lol
[1:56:02] <+Order_of_Mystery> rats = apatLiz apatSmug
[1:56:04] <Videogamer4> he needs to kill 3 specific ones tho
[1:56:05] <Pandapanda92> why are you always a manlet in fromsoft games
[1:56:11] <Djinnazz> don't forget you have that gourd seed.
[1:56:27] <vadnhi> Rats = Potato-Ninja

[1:56:37] <+Ziryuri> Rats= doodBenny doodHokey doodStare doodKen doodLewd doodJJ
[1:56:42] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus Hes talking about a specific group of those
[1:56:51] <GoldeNOVA> Just go to the gate, don't worry about it
[1:56:56] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus Don't over think it, just progress through the game Asahina castle gate is the next area
[1:57:01] <+Order_of_Mystery> 3
[1:57:07] <Videogamer4> @woolieversus you'll know the rats you need to kill when you see them trust us
[1:57:07] <%RioGascar> the last part is where to go
[1:57:09] <+duskrush> @WoolieVersus You're overthinking it
[1:57:16] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus Can't kill just any of them, has to be the specific group its talking about
[1:57:18] <+Ziryuri> Woolie Verses Yo Video Games!
[1:57:18] <MForan98> just a few
[1:57:21] <+Weeewer> This world works on One Piece rules
[1:57:24] <arkv01> ninjas are short man
[1:57:24] <+Konquerer> you're just tiny
[1:57:24] <+天使42199> sekiro is a manlet
[1:57:28] <+天使42199> Kappa
[1:57:29] <OctoBazooka> They're cooler than you
[1:57:31] <%GraceTBM> Cause they've got more souls than you
[1:57:33] <+skylaryeah> they have more souls
[1:57:34] <th3madness> the tengu are just freak beasts
[1:57:34] <Flare3500> You're a Naruto
[1:57:36] <Slimeking_Mike> Everyone's taller so you can read their movements if you fight them
[1:57:38] <+DrPoxx> what if you are pat sized?
[1:57:39] <GoldeNOVA> Shinobi manlets, when will they ever learn?
[1:57:39] <%RioGascar> it says “last place seen was ashina castle gate”
[1:57:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> A Manling
[1:57:39] <0rond> what if you are an extra smol samurai
[1:57:41] <Zayasu> they have more souls than you Kappa
[1:57:43] <mechslayer71> @pandapanda92 you missed the part where everyone important is 9 feet tall LUL
[1:57:46] <gremoirhirst> Shinobi only go up to their shins. (I am so sorry)
[1:57:48] <Videogamer4> cause you didn't grind off screen to get HUGE LUL
[1:57:51] <+Sxy_T_Rex> Sekiro is pretty much Danny Devito
[1:57:53] <vadnhi> Don't you know that Japan has always traditionally grown especially tall and huge people? ;P
[1:57:59] <+Order_of_Mystery> 'I need yamato'
[1:58:04] <+Ziryuri> Now you understand the stuggles of small nibbas A.k.a Patt
[1:58:09] <SixthSun2> Something big crashed through there
[1:58:19] <+TheBigO75> Little did we know Sekiro was the Korichi of this world.
[1:58:21] <Videogamer4> what form of power is this?

[1:58:32] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> yeyeyeyeye
[1:58:34] <+Bad1uck> No wonder Pat lives this game, it makes a tiny man seem badass
[1:58:35] <0rond> it's really is a fromsoft thing isn't it? in dark souls it was also like that and it was because "they had more souls" or "they belonged to a race of giants" but there is just no excuse here
[1:58:36] <Flare3500> Anal Beads

[2:05:39] <+Champine> theres the rats
[2:05:42] <+egalitarian696969> Splinter Cell Conviction "stealth"
[2:05:43] <+boten_anne> are we gonna backseat drive Woolie into hard mode

[2:05:53] <vadnhi> Those are the rats, Woolie.
[2:05:59] <NergalTV> they wanted a samurai game with stealth but stealth is not very samurai-ish
[2:05:59] <+Weeewer> Hey look, rats

[2:06:07] <+Weeewer> Btw these guys are great for grinding
[2:06:10] <DatAsuna> The intended design is for you to NEVER leave the first area until you have 99 skill points
[2:06:13] <@SoushinSen> You're eavesdropping rats btw
[2:06:13] <%juxtest> You can tell which areas are meant for stealth and which arent
[2:06:15] <+Weeewer> Theyre easy to kill, close to a spawn and give a good amount of exp
[2:06:22] <+Order_of_Mystery> rats detected
[2:06:34] <+Mcmoblin> Rats located
[2:06:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:07:28] <FivePointKnight> Axe my dude
[2:07:31] <+Weeewer> shield enemies dont mess around
[2:07:33] <GoldeNOVA> Yeah, that makes sense!
[2:07:34] <+天使42199> I think its more to signify the critical hit you get when you stealth kill em
[2:07:37] <NeroInfinite> Remember blight town?
[2:07:39] <+deidriel> Use the axe
[2:07:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> throw an axe!
[2:07:47] <shotgang86> woolie you made0 posture damage
[2:07:47] <+天使42199> like just stabbing them through the chest
[2:07:48] <%juxtest> Hes using his hat as if it were some sort of solid barrier!
[2:07:50] <%RioGascar> Honestly the music department in this game is really ranging from bad to eh
[2:07:51] <th3madness> woolie tactics win again
[2:07:53] <defaultmeta> Use axe
[2:07:54] <Flare3500> Stay free

[2:11:17] <$cureneckbeard> master of the fast piss
[2:11:22] <+skylerpilot> Ichimonji is the best
[2:11:26] <%Toynota10> Of course we won't spoil. I'd hope everyyone here knows Woolie
[2:11:26] <$zero_g_toad> ichi is good
[2:11:29] <laguerrilha> Hope the last battle happens besides a Sakura tree during sunset or on a sunflower field
[2:11:40] <startadevy> KAPOW
[2:11:43] <mechslayer71> The next two after this one are the best ones in the game Pat was talking about @woolieversus
[2:11:45] <MagicHatss> Hewwo?

[2:11:55] <+Weeewer> The NEXT skill is even better
[2:11:56] <startadevy> Wu!
[2:12:02] <+gespenst25> I feel so sorry for the little prince. and this is basically a souls game so I doubt that he going to get to live a pleasant life...
[2:12:03] <+Weeewer> Yep thats the money
[2:12:05] <+Sxy_T_Rex> and if you hold it for 10 minutes you can cut open a door to hell
[2:12:09] <+Mcmoblin> These skills are needed
[2:12:11] <$cureneckbeard> lore
[2:12:13] <th3madness> Ashina style is killer
[2:12:14] <+demonsamura> carp cant fight
[2:12:23] <+skylerpilot> @th3madness as it should be!

[2:12:48] <+gespenst25> @demonsamura they can use flail and tackle
[2:12:49] <FackinCrazy> so together you just wreck shit
[2:12:51] <+Order_of_Mystery> you really wanna upgrade that tree, yo
[2:12:54] <vadnhi> BTW. for the next step of Tengu's quest, you need to complete your way to the end of at least one of the final branches of any skill tree. :)
[2:12:56] <mechslayer71> Consecutive parties are god mode with those too.
[2:12:56] <Flare3500> I'm sad that Max quit and didn't bother finishing the game
[2:13:00] <mechslayer71> Two*
[2:13:02] <%gunnar253> gunnar253 subscribed at Tier 1.
[2:13:10] <+Champine> he didnt get floating passage yet?
[2:13:11] <%RioGascar> Wait max quit?
[2:13:11] <mechslayer71> @flare3500 Why’d he quit?
[2:13:13] <+Weeewer> Side step into Ichimonji or well spaced Ichimonji is fantastic. I cant understate how good the posture recovery is good
[2:13:16] <+demonsamura> i love passive abilities
[2:13:22] <+Order_of_Mystery> max quit? rip
[2:13:26] <+Weeewer> That sentence made no sense but its fine
[2:13:35] <Flare3500> @mechslayer71 Rage quit really hard at the final boss

[2:14:09] <%juxtest> The rats do come back but arent in the way
[2:14:15] <+Champine> did woolie use the treasured fish scales for floating passage yet?
[2:14:25] <+Weeewer> Floating Passage is cool
[2:14:26] <+NoKingArthur> How far is woolie?
[2:14:29] <mechslayer71> Use the axe on the hats, Woolie @woolieversus
[2:14:34] <+demonsamura> those arent dogs... those are rats!
[2:14:36] <+Weeewer> Woolie is sub 50% mark
[2:14:44] <+TheBigO75> Snuff those pups
[2:14:45] <vadnhi> Floating Passage is just straight up a better basic combo.
[2:14:46] <Zayasu> bloodborne dogs are way worse
[2:14:47] <shotgang86> amazing
[2:14:47] <%RioGascar> Make sure to change your attack style
[2:14:50] <%OctopusLantern> OctopusLantern subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:14:50] <Flare3500> he beat 2 bosses
[2:14:54] <Seaspiritsden> FYI shurikens kill dogs in 1 hit
[2:14:55] <%serranobros> Does woolie have health of death blow yet?
[2:15:04] <SuperArson> nah
[2:15:04] <th3madness> Sekiro sure does snuff a lot of puppers
[2:15:10] <SuperArson> that's a little far into the tree
[2:15:13] <+Bad1uck> oooo big whiff
[2:15:29] <+Weeewer> try out ichimonji in combat, takes some practice
[2:15:37] <+demonsamura> yea the dogs in this game are pretty easy compared to soulsborne
[2:15:43] <+NoKingArthur> Ichimonji is the best
[2:15:46] <+Weeewer> The posture recovery is god tier
[2:15:56] <+Weeewer> In boss encounters its make or break
[2:16:01] <+redanimator> senran kagura dev quit marvelous over Sony censorship
[2:16:10] <+demonsamura> who?
[2:16:13] <+Bad1uck> it's easy to forget how easy DS makes plunging attacks with insane tracking
[2:17:00] <vadnhi> "How *dare* people censor these delicate young teens gigantic bazongas?"
[2:17:14] <+demonsamura> how young?
[2:17:21] <%afronooch> this part titlted me
[2:17:24] <%NotGran> NotGran subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2:17:29] <+Pajex_> this part is great
[2:17:32] <%juxtest> The giants hammering the ground always made me think Id been spotted
[2:17:42] <%afronooch> that second one killed me with a surprise attack
[2:17:53] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> the positioning of the second ogre out of sight is so perfect
[2:18:00] <Sarumarine> hold up, firecrackers work on non-beasts?
[2:18:03] <Flare3500> See firecrackers ! free hit
[2:18:07] <+Mcmoblin> Fireworks are great
[2:18:09] <+Mcmoblin> good stuns
[2:18:10] <%afronooch> exactly. I love it, but boi was i salty
[2:18:13] <Flare3500> IT WORKS ON EVERYONE
[2:18:15] <+demonsamura> are they ogres? arent they just big dude?
[2:18:28] <+Mcmoblin> Unlike Fire... fireworks just do so much stun
[2:18:30] <Slimeking_Mike> Firecrackers are probably my go-to prosthetic of the game
[2:18:31] <+Dogbert24> yea speedruns make ample use of firecracker spam
[2:18:40] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> eh ogres, big dudes, who knows, I just call them that for simplicity
[2:18:42] <+Order_of_Mystery> fireworks works on almost everything!
[2:18:48] <+demonsamura> ppl already doing speedruns?
[2:19:03] <Flare3500> We have to use the Firecrackers for Robert
[2:19:20] <+einheri> Well they use Oni clubs and stuff
[2:19:32] <Cymen90> PRAISE THE SUN
[2:19:37] <+demonsamura> you mean a mallet?

[2:20:00] <+Order_of_Mystery> \[T]/
[2:20:02] <+demonsamura> no
[2:20:05] <SixthSun2> It could be a rock, but the rock could be your enemy
[2:20:05] <th3madness> PREP
[2:20:07] <%juxtest> Ignore the boss arena
[2:20:20] <Tucker0603> @demonsamura later ones use Kanabō, which are Oni clubs

[2:27:33] <+Bad1uck> He don't stop coming and he don't stop coming and he don't stop coming
[2:27:34] <+MillerLowlife> doesn't that still inflict burn damage
[2:27:34] <+Order_of_Mystery> you can parry dogs; why not bulls?
[2:27:35] <0rond> @WoolieVersus you can parry the snake
[2:27:36] <arkv01> YOU WOULD NEVA EVAa

[2:27:38] <Jakepanda_games> SUP MAN
[2:27:47] <tag545> parry the flaming tank
[2:27:49] <%afronooch> dont pary just circle
[2:27:52] <Lilgamba> I heard you like Royalguard?
[2:27:52] <A_A_Ronin> Don’t parry he has pierce damage
[2:27:54] <%GarbageNirvana> It seems to stand to reason that if it isn't made of pure energy or some bullshit you can parry it
[2:27:56] <+lucaflowe> But whoolie the danger kanji doesn't show on the bull so you should be able to parry
[2:28:00] <+khelus789> wait and strike when he turns
[2:28:01] <%juxtest> If the warning thing doesnt come up you can parry it
[2:28:02] <%afronooch> fire hot, fire hurt
[2:28:04] <+天使42199> Yeah I just run behind the bull and strike his butt
[2:28:04] <Flare3500> You can parrry bullets like everything is possible as long as it doesn't show the red kanji sign
[2:28:06] <+Extraalex> The bull had me stuck for a long time. The fire cracker is the only way to go as far as I’m concerned
[2:28:12] <$cureneckbeard> 危
[2:28:15] <Pnuts_> I think almost everything but sweeps and grabs can be paried
[2:28:15] <+madmarquis> @Sarumarine & it can fly
[2:28:19] <@Menitta> You never parried a raging bull with a sword?
[2:28:23] <Pnuts_> *deflected
[2:28:25] <Jakepanda_games> thats a huge dog!
[2:28:26] <vadnhi> "If you can parry a wrench, you can parry a Bull!"
[2:28:28] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> That is one spicy bull
[2:28:28] <Sarumarine> The corner traps!
[2:28:42] <TenWren> that's hilarious
[2:28:47] <+fragdar> hey @WoolieVersus it's your first playthrough?
[2:28:52] <+MillerLowlife> how long til some motherfucker shows up to the running of the bulls with a katana
[2:28:56] <+Bad1uck> We're in Revengeance territory now: PARRY EVERYTHING
[2:28:56] <+Dogbert24> that bulls hide is made of metal apparantly
[2:28:58] <+demonsamura> you can jump off his head too
[2:28:59] <%afronooch> it is @fragdar
[2:29:16] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> firecrackers work great against animals c:
[2:29:18] <+Das_Prints> The tricky part about trading blocks with the bull is it stacks fire damage onto you and he does a lot of posture damage.
[2:29:30] <+Das_Prints> Fire status*
[2:29:34] <%juxtest> The only problem is that its hard to tell when its actually attacking
[2:29:41] <+Das_Prints> Also that.
[2:29:43] <tag545> bull combo
[2:29:49] <+demonsamura> too bad he doesnt have an item that reduces fire build up
[2:29:51] <+TheBigO75> Legit multi-hoof drifting
[2:30:05] <+duskrush> I always felt bad for this boss. It's just a bull scared out of its mind because it's got a flaming bale of hay stuck to its horns
[2:30:08] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> Sekiro is wearing red. he's basically a big target
[2:30:27] <+Bad1uck> Toro Toro!
[2:30:27] <chroma3> omg this boss, so annoying lol
[2:30:28] <+demonsamura> i thought he was wearing brown?
[2:30:33] <Flare3500> spam frackers
[2:30:35] <Tucker0603> BURNING!!!!
[2:30:36] <+demonsamura> isnt the red just the blood?
[2:30:46] <$cureneckbeard> He's wearing orange like Boruto's dad
[2:30:53] <tag545> im half expecting the bull to suplex you at the start of the second round
[2:31:03] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> YO

[2:31:33] <+Order_of_Mystery> parry! that! bull!
[2:31:33] <+Link232> Bull's there to teach you you can parry anything that isn't perilous, you parry even more ridiculous stuff later on
[2:31:39] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[2:31:40] <+VariantX7> gotta taste for some ribeye steak all of a sudden
[2:31:51] <mostundesired> Well, yeah, if you're a coward Kappa
[2:31:51] <Sarumarine> It should just run you over, haha
[2:31:51] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Yeah you did not parry the snake either
[2:31:51] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus You were one block away from death because the fire still hurts even when you block!!!!
[2:31:52] <$cureneckbeard> this part owns
[2:31:53] <vadnhi> It's kind of a bummer that this thing is just a poor animal that has no clue as to just why these humans cruelly tied a burning log to his head. :(
[2:31:57] <cj_art> nah son you gotta do swordplay with a bull
[2:31:57] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus be the lawbringer, PARRY THE WORLD

[2:32:14] <+duskrush> I mean, you shot eldritch gods in the face with flintlock pistols in Bloodborne. Parrying a bull can't be that far of a jump, lol
[2:32:22] <Pnuts_> @WoolieVersus you can also cheeze this guy buy unlocking and just hitting his butt
[2:32:22] <OctoBazooka> Smelter?

[2:36:09] <Storm_Samurai> lol pat just lost to Genichiro Ashina in ng+ so he started over
[2:36:12] <+Bad1uck> Codger dodger is not a phrase I thought would exist
[2:36:22] <+Link232> You can actually join the old lady in prayer, it's a bit of a secret how it's done though
[2:36:32] <Flare3500> Counter damage is basically stronger
[2:36:42] <+neptune_estate> nah
[2:37:08] <+Bad1uck> @demonsamura This is just Nipponese Mardi Gras

[2:52:34] <+Thunderhog> LUL
[2:52:38] <+Bad1uck> haha that Sparta kick
[2:52:41] <%afronooch> sooo close
[2:52:44] <+Aeoneth> my recommendation woolie, try to do an air deathblow on him if you want to start witha big advantage
[2:52:47] <BlkFlameKami> LUL
[2:52:59] <BusterRepukken> Shooters in this game have psychic powers and its very annoying
[2:53:06] <%afronooch> the shuriken has a pretty long range
[2:53:16] <+Aeoneth> shuriken them
[2:53:18] <+Aeoneth> it takes 2
[2:53:21] <Sarumarine> Ashina's best riflemen
[2:53:39] <+Bad1uck> GREED
[2:53:45] <+Thunderhog> actual question since i've yet to get the game. can you parry the bullets?
[2:53:46] <%juxtest> Clever
[2:53:49] <invader_rin> Shooters in this game have eagleeyes and see you from 100 miles away
[2:53:52] <+Link232> Yeah you can bullet parry
[2:53:59] <+Thunderhog> ok thats sick
[2:54:03] <tag545> run and stealth
[2:54:06] <MagicHatss> shhh
[2:54:09] <+Dogbert24> time to be a big coward
[2:54:15] <Monkeyweed21> run away and backstab
[2:54:16] <+Link232> If you're a coward, run away, reset aggro, backstab
[2:54:17] <Jetsfantasy> any pellets?
[2:54:23] <KillMyPast> You can deaggro then stealth him
[2:54:24] <+MillerLowlife> i think you can just straight block bullets
[2:54:25] <$cureneckbeard> Haha, I am a genius! / Oh no!
[2:54:30] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @Flare3500
[2:54:34] <shotgang86> AW LAED
[2:54:35] <GreatJumps> Run away! like a hero
[2:54:38] <%Itselguapo> Oh Lawd he comin
[2:54:38] <MagicHatss> shhhhh
[2:54:40] <+Link232> Shhhhh
[2:54:41] <+demonsamura> dont think you can deaggro minibosses
[2:54:42] <Thalchampz> oh lawd he comin
[2:54:44] <+DmanDoesThings> You can do it, trash man
[2:54:52] <%Raefer> samurai can only yell at roof ninja
[2:54:56] <MagicHatss> hush hush there is no rush
[2:55:05] <Monkeyweed21> ninjas were known for their bravery and honor
[2:55:06] <Tetsu_TIW> Embrace Nero's taunt and start slamming on the air guitar
[2:55:07] <Thalchampz> silent poke
[2:55:14] <$cureneckbeard> shhh
[2:55:18] <+rednecked__crake> in the rear
[2:55:18] <+thackattack00> the virgin shinobi vs the chad samurai

[2:55:25] <+derpumpkinking> hello woolie! I hope your shinobi adventures are going well
[2:55:35] <+DmanDoesThings> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:55:37] <$cureneckbeard> This game really makes you feel like Spiderman.
[2:55:40] <+demonsamura> maybe you cant deaggro after the first stab
[2:55:46] <SixthSun2> Jump on a guy when he sweeps, it can do a bit of stance damage
[2:55:47] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:55:48] <+SuperBloodWolfMoon> Did Woolie already try Seven Spears?
[2:55:53] <+rednecked__crake> 我こそサムライ!
[2:55:54] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeyeye
[2:55:57] <+demonsamura> no
[2:56:01] <+Bad1uck> You did well

[2:56:24] <invader_rin> Watch your posture there woolie
[2:56:28] <%afronooch> this whole section almost made me ragequit tbh
[2:56:29] <Flare3500> Boom Firecrackers
[2:56:29] <+rednecked__crake> fireworks are dishonorable
[2:56:30] <$cureneckbeard> It's over Woolie, I have the high ground

[2:56:48] <+Aeoneth> So... for that guy You CAN run away and rest to reset the fight... you'll just have to deal with the snipers again
[2:56:57] <+rednecked__crake> SekiroDeath rip no death emote OhGod
[2:56:59] <+KleverART> You can’t just go and hide again?
[2:57:01] <tag545> clean roof. clear mob. then stealth
[2:57:03] <+RushUnplugged> tactic was good, be full coward ninja and hide after clearing riflemen
[2:57:06] <SixthSun2> Jump on a guy when they do an unblockable sweep, it can do some stance damage @WoolieVersus
[2:57:09] <%afronooch> you have more range than the riflemen
[2:57:13] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Dear @WoolieVersus , How much would I have to donate for you to sing the One Piece rap?
[2:57:13] <+Aeoneth> nope if you run and hide he gains the 1st pip back
[2:57:20] <Lilgamba> The performance of this game has me intrigued as to how Sucker Punch's game is gonna be
[2:57:21] <+SuperBloodWolfMoon> If you're confident in your sidestepping, you can charge up the stairs and kill the gunners while you dodge Kuranosuke.
[2:57:25] <+KleverART> Two sneak attacks?
[2:57:26] <invader_rin> That's why you pick them off one by one
[2:57:26] <+DmanDoesThings> @KleverART He regens HP if you run
[2:57:30] <+FreyRune> I cleared the snipers first, hide and stealth attack the general. it helps a lot
[2:57:43] <tag545> if you deagro he heals so only one sneak
[2:57:43] <+KleverART> Ahh got ya
[2:57:44] <defaultmeta> @woolieversus use your shirtless
[2:57:45] <Pistachius> i love he sheathed his katana after killim him, like "my business is done."
[2:57:49] <+demonsamura> what is sucker punchs game?
[2:57:53] <defaultmeta> Sorry
[2:58:01] <+FreyRune> 4 snipers
[2:58:07] <Flare3500> Ghost of Sushi
[2:58:15] <+Aeoneth> 2 shuriken takes out 1 sniper. But you can't toss them both out or they block the 2nd one
[2:58:17] <Flare3500> Tsushima
[2:58:32] <+demonsamura> 4 minutes? O.o
[2:58:36] <+FreyRune> yeah, it took me around 30 minutes to clear the mini boss
[2:58:44] <defaultmeta> Use your shurikens to take out the side dudes from afar, 2-3 shurikens will take one out from afar and then you can sneak up on him
[2:58:51] <laguerrilha> NUT
[2:58:57] <SixthSun2> crack a nut Kreygasm
[2:59:02] <+Bad1uck> Yeah don't crack a nut on stream, I hear they ban for that now
[2:59:02] <EMP_SoloSagat> yeah shuriken are good for the gunners
