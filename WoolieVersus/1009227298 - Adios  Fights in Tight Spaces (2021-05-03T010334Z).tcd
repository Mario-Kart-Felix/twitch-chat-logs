[0:42:15] <khalcatto> creator said that you can't say grey ones because sometimes you want to say something things but can't
[0:42:24] <+nabs2099> @minerslovegames It's sunk cost fallacy. spent so long in a pointless conflict, doing horrible things and committing all kinds of atrocities and for what? for America to leave after they lost so bad. It's sunk cost fallacy. You didn't win, you didn't win, as America pulled out of a country they destroyed. I'm not surprised your cramps felt that way. can't even blame him.

[0:45:00] <MinersLoveGames> This was during the height of the Red Scare, when anti-communism was at its peak. The United States made themselves the self-proclaimed guardians against it and swore they'd fight any attempts to spread Communism in the world.
[0:45:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> the USA thought that if Vietnam went commie, then other southeast Asian countries would too, look up "domino effect"
[0:45:16] <leith_aziz> @aiutare47: I mean they backed them, but from what you said, it seems US could have just stayed neutral
[0:45:22] <%BusterRepukken> some great gatsby shit
[0:45:23] <%kewlmyc> ...fuck.
[0:45:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wow thats petty
[0:45:29] <+krispen_wa> the US would never have stayed neutral during that time
[0:45:29] <aiutare47> @leith_aziz Could’ve. Yep.

[0:52:34] <JoshManVGH> @superbro64 Supposedly they introduced Japanese chestnut trees that had adapted to the fungus, while the North American trees had now. I'm going to assume the naming of a fungus was not based on limited scope from the region.
[0:52:40] <Darren716> Where is Sol going? monkaS

[1:05:31] <+Noonoox12> SLAP
[1:05:34] <Darren716> He covered wars you know
[1:05:36] <Mr_Zero5232> Meanwhile Activision: press F to ignore the Crack Epidemic
[1:05:38] <+nabs2099> I love this genre. I want more talking sims. I would be super happy If this had all just been in one room too lmao

[1:05:43] <+The_Devil_Breaker> My flag hella red then
[1:05:48] <MinersLoveGames> It's the silences that's really getting me.
[1:06:02] <aiutare47> Yup
[1:06:03] <%ChoculaUltra> the silences really set the somber mood
[1:06:05] <@Menitta> Snatch tought me that
[1:06:06] <+ghostfaceninja_> @nabs2099, books are a thing
[1:06:09] <khalcatto> not snatch woolie?
[1:06:10] <problemagic> unexpected
[1:06:13] <leith_aziz> You have this game and then you have COD: Cold War......
[1:06:13] <Flare3500> Play one winged angel
[1:06:13] <+Mendin> Moonlight Sonata it ain't
[1:06:16] <DSD24> Piano Man
[1:06:19] <%ChoculaUltra> play megalovania
[1:06:22] <Mr_Zero5232> Bricktop taught me that
[1:06:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @Minerslovegames farms can be rather silent.
[1:06:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> play wonderwall
[1:06:29] <bitterssweets> play one winged angel
[1:06:31] <+krispen_wa> moonlight sonata it is
[1:06:32] <Flare3500> Fur Elise what is this baby shit
[1:06:32] <+RyTYoung> Ahh greensleves
[1:06:34] <+678saintglock> aw man my eyes almost leaked once that piano started
[1:06:34] <WG101> play freebird
[1:06:36] <problemagic> good ol loodvig van
[1:06:37] <leith_aziz> ugh I hate Activision
[1:06:38] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus In Snatch, Brick Top says you have to remove the teeth so they don't get indigestion
[1:06:46] <+astrofalcon1> play freebird
[1:06:46] <jamox1> I just got here, any context I need to know?
[1:06:53] <Jaysky> Chat is there a time limit at this part?
[1:06:55] <$emptyantics> LUL
[1:06:57] <problemagic> mary had a little lamb
[1:07:00] <+krispen_wa> context is this guy is about to die
[1:07:01] <aiutare47> @jamox1 It’s his last day.
[1:07:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jaysky na
[1:07:03] <+nabs2099> @ghostfaceninja_ Lol that's why I love reading em! but I'm talking specifically about games like this where we have dialogue choices and it's just some people talking. Books are like games, wildly varied in genre and quality and it's nice to have that variety.
[1:07:03] <%RyanGelatin> NO
[1:07:08] <+astrofalcon1> play bohemian rhapsody
[1:07:08] <+Superbro64> I do too :)
[1:07:09] <Mr_Zero5232> And the hair
[1:07:10] <DingusMcBaseball> theyre the same lol
[1:07:11] <+FrostedZaibatsu> My grandma had a piano on the farm. I was so sad when she sold it
[1:07:14] <Louie_Salmon> Chopsticks is low-key a banger

[1:07:14] <jamox1> Gotcha thanks!!
[1:07:15] <+Mendin> @Jaysky I believe it's still task-gated
[1:07:21] <Jaysky> Ok good
[1:07:23] <leith_aziz> Maybe finish with a great meal ?
[1:07:27] <CappuccinoGuil> check upstairs?
[1:07:27] <problemagic> old mcdonald and marry had a little lamb are the same song
[1:07:31] <leith_aziz> Its his last day
[1:07:31] <Flare3500> Do one last jack off
[1:07:35] <+Mendin> Ah, the mudroom
[1:07:36] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Hot Cross Buns is where its at
[1:07:36] <%ChoculaUltra> this is so stressful. I wouldn't even know what to have for my last meal and probably end up dying hungry
[1:07:39] <Flare3500> Watch Anime
[1:07:43] <jamox1> Tom Hanks is my favorite piano piece
[1:07:51] <problemagic> where'd you put the gun?
[1:07:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Soak in the moment
[1:07:52] <leith_aziz> If I was in this situation, I think I would run away
[1:07:53] <KaiserMario> Oh yeah that creepy movie with a 30 year old lady fucks a 13 year old boy
[1:07:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> @jamox1 Man who disposes of bodies for a hitman wants to stop. Hitman would have to kill him if he stops. Both try to convince the other about continuing or stopping because they're genuine friends
[1:07:55] <+Mendin> Check upstairs beforehand
[1:07:55] <fishmonger555> Time for home alone
[1:07:56] <leith_aziz> Or at least try
[1:08:02] <DSD24> I hope there is a massive cow painting
[1:08:02] <Broand> upstairs
[1:08:03] <+nabs2099> @choculaultra I also think this guy doesn't care about all that. he wants to die.
[1:08:07] <problemagic> dump it out!
[1:08:14] <%kewlmyc> You make chocolate milk with them
[1:08:17] <+krispen_wa> TURN THEN INTO DIAMONDS
[1:08:19] <jamox1> @goose_attack_almanac ohhh damn ok
[1:08:21] <bitterssweets> you rub it on your face
[1:08:21] <problemagic> my grandmother used to have a tv like that
[1:08:22] <Jaysky> @leith_aziz He wants to die though, if he didn't he would have agreed with the hitman
[1:08:22] <+yukichocomilk> that's not what you do?
[1:08:23] <%eyezehuhh> snoooof
[1:08:23] <+krispen_wa> CARRY THEM INTO BATTLE
[1:08:23] <@Solidus_113> spread them on your face like Venom Snake

[1:08:52] <+IronChefWookie> whats that thing on the counter
[1:08:52] <%ChoculaUltra> @nabs2099 I get that vibe too, the wandering around the house rn feels like one last collection check before the end :(

[1:09:23] <Flare3500> Bill and his animes
[1:09:25] <MinersLoveGames> No mirror.
[1:09:28] <Deko_> oof
[1:09:28] <%Alazull> Took the mirror down
[1:09:29] <%kewlmyc> Nice bathroom
[1:09:36] <DSD24> It doesn't even matter how hard you tru
[1:09:46] <%Alazull> This old man is saying a long slow goodbye
[1:09:50] <leith_aziz> Calling the cops would probablöy not be a bad call if you wanna nab your killers
[1:09:53] <Broand> Check out the kids room a little more
[1:09:57] <leith_aziz> *Probably
[1:10:04] <problemagic> its awful is what it is
[1:10:04] <+nabs2099> @choculaultra I agree, but it also feels like the purpose is to make us have to sit with what's about to happen. what do you do when you can SEE the timer on your life about to run out? imagine it's like the time right before a big exam but 5 times worse.
[1:10:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> No time for the journal either
[1:10:07] <DingusMcBaseball> i like it
[1:10:10] <CappuccinoGuil> This room is the spitting image of my great-grandparents'
[1:10:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh shit the bed hit me
[1:10:14] <Triplicat> no one ever stops
[1:10:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh wait never mind
[1:10:20] <+The_Devil_Breaker> @leith_aziz They're only sending one person - the farmer's old friend
[1:10:25] <problemagic> is this guy a murderer?
[1:10:26] <CappuccinoGuil> He did say he was a photographer
[1:10:26] <aiutare47> @cappuccinoguil That’s what hits me so hard
[1:10:27] <Mr_Zero5232> @leith_aziz nothing like small town cops to let ya know how useless picking up the phone can be
[1:10:40] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Man had every hobby in the world
[1:10:40] <DSD24> Look at this photograph?
[1:10:44] <ZeeJiggle> Oh yeah, he did mention developing photo's huh
[1:10:46] <MinersLoveGames> Took a photography class in senior year of high school. Flunked it.
[1:10:47] <leith_aziz> @The_Devil_Breaker Yeah I guess he wouldnt be the likely suspect
[1:10:49] <bitterssweets> this dude is rich af if this was what he had today
[1:10:50] <Broand> Check out the kids room again
[1:10:50] <%Alazull> Nah, this is how people used to have to do it to develop photos at home
[1:10:53] <MinersLoveGames> One of my big regrets.
[1:10:55] <Flare3500> Where''s the SNES it's 92 !!

[1:24:25] <+nabs2099> I'm agreeing with the son on this one.
[1:24:27] <leith_aziz> Ï remember that Bojack episode
[1:24:32] <+TrevSmith222> So if it bothered Bill so much, why didn't he take care of his mom?
[1:24:33] <+RyTYoung> Holding it back
[1:24:35] <prime_name> Alzheimers is fuckin scary man
[1:24:37] <debugdrawray_> WAIT are the other options not selectable?
[1:24:41] <+docseuss> @TrevSmith222 you're about to find out
[1:24:43] <SixthShinx> Son is too late for this
[1:24:46] <+FrostedZaibatsu> They dont even wear their mask in homes. shits awful
[1:24:51] <leith_aziz> @TrevSmith222 It wasnt his choice is what makes him piossed
[1:24:52] <+krispen_wa> @debugdrawray_ those are just inner thoughts
[1:24:53] <+678saintglock> bill's kinda being a bastard but main character man could have spoke on it better
[1:24:53] <%nintega010> @heartlesshealer it really is. It's so stressful on you
[1:24:54] <aiutare47> @debugdrawray_ No their his internal monologues
[1:24:55] <Flare3500> Why didn't Bill take care of his mom then ?
[1:24:55] <+Iamdenril> bill please
[1:24:56] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, so it sounds like the son doesn't even know about the mob ties
[1:24:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> I said it when Pat played, that's a really powerful dialogue tool
[1:25:05] <debugdrawray_> fuck thats great
[1:25:05] <+luftraumm1> @docseuss woolie has a religious family background, he's got some insight into these guys
[1:25:23] <+Iamdenril> BILL
[1:25:28] <Louie_Salmon> If anyone thinks that dialogue trick rules, check out The Beginner's Guide as well
[1:25:32] <heartlesshealer> @nintega010 yeah, knowing that you're forcing someone you love to live with someone they think they don't know feels bad
[1:25:34] <ChoculaUltra> damn, he didn't even tell his son where the home was?!
[1:25:46] <Tooniearcade> evoMindBlown evoMindBlown evoMindBlown
[1:25:47] <%ChoculaUltra> oh fuck me
[1:25:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @ChoculaUltra couldn't risk it
[1:25:48] <leith_aziz> He didnt even tell him ?
[1:25:48] <BackflipCharm> Everyone go buy this game
[1:25:50] <+krispen_wa> OOF
[1:25:51] <MinersLoveGames> My parents and aunts and uncles took care of my grandfather for years even as he degraded further before finally putting him in a home. It's unbelievable.
[1:25:53] <Flare3500> Ok Bill did his best
[1:25:53] <bitterssweets> fuck

[1:26:06] <%jepupu> Alzheimer's sucks, later they don't recognize people and care barely talk anymore. They're still there, but only for a small part anymore. Like the soul would be leaving the body bit by bit.

[1:26:14] <TheCrispyBoi> fuck man
[1:26:15] <%justcallmebobplease> @heartlesshealer Yeah, because a forgetful wife might spill the beans about the body disposal to the son, which'd put HIM in danger too. It's super fucked.
[1:26:17] <+krispen_wa> FUUUCK
[1:26:18] <+Ultimate_Edge> Maaaan

[1:49:49] <JoshManVGH> @kewlmyc It's an efficient form of par cooking. You partially cook the potatoes before fully cooking them someother way. Makes sure they are tender and lets them absorb more of what ever you're cooking them in.

[1:51:56] <leith_aziz> ok
[1:51:58] <aiutare47> Damn
[1:51:59] <+klooswep> Press R2 to counter the bullet
[1:52:00] <penitentpendant> If he doesn't eat the bullet, they go after his son.
[1:52:00] <+PlatinumRevol> Use the middle stick to avoid the gunfire
[1:52:01] <Asuterisuku> Try with a different gun?
[1:52:01] <NeroInfinite> nope no choice
[1:52:02] <leith_aziz> wait......
[1:52:03] <T_Sasquatch> LUL woolie is expecting wy more than this game is
[1:52:04] <Daxalog> I love sneeze guns
[1:52:04] <+astrofalcon1> he doesn't know FeelsBadMan
[1:52:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> nothing you can do
[1:52:06] <ZippyPsycho> Looks like the shotgun is there so the cops and neighbors know it's a suicide or something
[1:52:06] <+0neReeler> boourns
[1:52:07] <Jaysky> I noticed the hitman doesn't look directly at you when he shoots
[1:52:08] <+Freelance7> only one ending
[1:52:10] <tacostarvedbeast> gg no re
[1:52:11] <coldfire0007> Witch time
[1:52:11] <+Bearded_mushrum> lol unlucky
[1:52:12] <Darren716> And he gets fed to his own pigs
[1:52:12] <leith_aziz> Feelsbadman
[1:52:12] <Flare3500> Someone said no multiple endings don't know if that was true
[1:52:13] <+678saintglock> just parry it
[1:52:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> Why would he fight back?
[1:52:14] <brunoberserk> royalguard the bullet
[1:52:14] <@Menitta> Mikiri counter the gun
[1:52:16] <fuji_92> only one ending
[1:52:17] <%Exiliator> I would be surprised if you could
[1:52:17] <Broand> you've given up, you can't stop it
[1:52:19] <Louie_Salmon> Almost like an Adios
[1:52:21] <+astrofalcon1> just do a super
[1:52:21] <aiutare47> LIKE A MOVIE
[1:52:23] <+Jiggisnipe> the shotgun is unloaded as a message maybe
[1:52:24] <linSP> Eat up piggies
[1:52:24] <BaronVonProlix> there would be no point in him fighting back
[1:52:25] <leith_aziz> He doesnt wanna fight
[1:52:25] <+Bearded_mushrum> you knew
[1:52:26] <%kylejefferies> only one ending.
[1:52:26] <%livlinn> RIP shiaCry
[1:52:26] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> ukemi the bullet
[1:52:27] <+krispen_wa> ROYAL RELEASE THE GUNSHOT
[1:52:27] <%JustToWatch> Woolie gets it
[1:52:29] <+678saintglock> wake up DP
[1:52:31] <%Gasgrave> The gun is just a message to the hitman. You aren't supposed to actually fire it.
[1:52:34] <+ja07sj> @WoolieVersus chekov's unloaded gun
[1:52:34] <Eger007> edie of herself
[1:52:35] <+Bearded_mushrum> they know you knew
[1:52:36] <DatAsuna> You're playing him not playing you yeah
[1:52:38] <fancypanzer> become one with the pigs
[1:52:42] <Eger007> edie as herself
[1:52:42] <echobee_tv> Release the Woolie Cut.
[1:52:47] <%Namillus> DC Douglas tho
[1:52:49] <+Jiggisnipe> I could fight you if I wanted to but... naw
[1:52:54] <Jashter18> I mean him and the Hitman are friends so he probably doesnt want him going down for this
[1:52:55] <Flare3500> Wheres the Snyder Cut ?
[1:52:56] <BlackermanZX> FeelsBadMan
[1:52:59] <DatAsuna> not "even though it's empty" BECAUSE it's empty
[1:53:01] <+RyTYoung> Hitmaaaaaaaan!
[1:53:04] <+Superbro64> Could you shoot the hitman in the skeet scene? @woolieversus
[1:53:08] <%r0chelimit> I think it might be a motivator for the hit man to shoot on sight
[1:53:13] <aiutare47> @superbro64 No
[1:53:14] <%Noonoox12> @Superbro64 nope.
[1:53:17] <leith_aziz> So like, "I can fight back if I wanted to, dont underestimate me"
[1:53:18] <BaronVonProlix> the farmer understands the situation, hes showing he could defend himself, but chose not to
[1:53:20] <+Superbro64> thought as much
[1:53:22] <+Bearded_mushrum> woolie cut is just a whens mahvel sign
[1:53:22] <T_Sasquatch> synder cut might as well be a dec series and not a movie
[1:53:33] <LoneFonte> @Superbro64 nah, you just get an achievement "Nice Try"
[1:53:34] <jorniev> the hitman really likes the farmer too
[1:53:37] <%Exiliator> I saw it as a way to signal that there was "no more talking", dont come in here and try and talk to me again, just get me
[1:53:41] <DSD24> Goodbye
[1:53:42] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe this farmer's got multiple guns
[1:53:43] <brachydios777> Short stream
[1:53:50] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Got this game is so good
[1:53:54] <Mr_Zero5232> @t_sasquatch no, stop giving that hack more money
[1:53:54] <Asuterisuku> What happens if you just nuke the burrito?
[1:53:56] <leith_aziz> I like that we can discuss what the end means in th end
[1:53:57] <+astrofalcon1> short and sweet
[1:54:01] <+nabs2099> good ass game.
[1:54:05] <leith_aziz> Like we aint 100% sure
[1:54:08] <prime_name> You gotta feel for the Hitman in that story
[1:54:11] <BaronVonProlix> just duck woolie jeez
[1:54:15] <fuji_92> GO BUY THIS GAME CHAT
[1:54:23] <T_Sasquatch> @Mr_Zero5232 who said i paid to watch it Kappa
[1:54:23] <+FlyingRamen> 15 years man
[1:54:24] <+RyTYoung> I think imma play this on my jank ass laptop
[1:54:27] <TheCrispyBoi> 15 years
[1:54:32] <leith_aziz> As someone who's: Story > Gameplay, I loved this
[1:54:33] <Flare3500> There's an upcoming game called "12 Minutes" could be fun
[1:54:43] <%livlinn> um...GGs?
[1:54:45] <fuji_92> they were friends, 15 years of doing that
[1:54:45] <MinersLoveGames> They were genuine friends.
[1:54:48] <+The_Devil_Breaker> He's like "Man, can you not?"
[1:54:52] <+SenorCounter> I wonder if the next game will be from the hitman's perspective right after this.
[1:54:52] <jorniev> The hitman really tried to make him change his mind
[1:54:54] <theloganbrand> 15 years
[1:54:56] <+RyTYoung> There was a friendship there over the years
[1:54:58] <%JustToWatch> Buy this game so the devs can afford to make future games and get a dog and healthcare
[1:55:03] <aiutare47> 15 years of bodies
[1:55:04] <Mr_Zero5232> @t_sasquatch ah a pirates life for me
[1:55:08] <leith_aziz> The thought that my friend would accpet shooting me after so much time
[1:55:08] <+nabs2099> @flare3500 Man I haven't heard about that game in a LONG time.
[1:55:14] <leith_aziz> *Accept
[1:55:21] <leith_aziz> Would break my heart
[1:55:25] <@Menitta> its a fascinating narrative
[1:55:32] <BaronVonProlix> the fact its labeled *MEAT* says a lot as well, not body parts. its like youd rather not think too hard about it
[1:55:35] <fancypanzer> getting fed to the same pigs who hid all your evil deeds
[1:55:50] <leith_aziz> Some irony here
[1:55:50] <aiutare47> Yeah getting fed to your own pigs
[1:55:50] <%JustToWatch> @leith_aziz I think it broke the hitman's heart more than the farmer
[1:55:52] <$thomassolorio> feeding bodys to pigs
[1:55:54] <Mr_Zero5232> Can only work with someone for so long without forming some form of relationship
[1:55:56] <Flare3500> @nabs2099 I think the last time I saw it was E3 when the SBFP was still a thing
[1:56:01] <+Jiggisnipe> bad people can be good friends Kappa
[1:56:05] <Mr_Taters > @Asuterisuku You get to eat the burrito as the dinner pretty much
[1:56:16] <BaronVonProlix> WHO WANTS SOME BACON
[1:56:23] <CappuccinoGuil> He started it to get money to save his sick son.
[1:56:24] <fancypanzer> the hustle economy
[1:56:27] <@Menitta> meanwhile Brick Top wants you to fight
[1:56:30] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:56:30] <Flare3500> Alright time for Overcooked LP with Hells Kitchen playing in the backgroung
[1:56:34] <+nabs2099> @flare3500 Part of me thinks it's in development hell, which sucks cos it had a Damn good premise. guess I'll look it up later.
[1:56:37] <jorniev> I can't believe my favorite mechanic in this game are a bunch of options I CAN'T PICK
[1:56:41] <DSD24> Run the clock back

[1:56:45] <echobee_tv> Get Into Fighting Games: Les Miserables
[1:56:47] <+The_Devil_Breaker> If you also pay attention to the details like him asking the farmer to leave the door open so there's no sign of break in, and the farmer asking people to come by for things in a few days... You start to realize that both the farmer and the hitman know that the farmer's body is going to be disappeared, and there's some trust to reduce stress post-mortem
[1:56:50] <+krispen_wa> LUL

[1:57:49] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Adios Reggie
[1:57:49] <%Exiliator> That's what I assumed at least? Like the symbolism is that you were fed as well in the end
[1:57:49] <%ZweihanderSteve> lol my meeting was exactly long as this game so i guessed i missed everthing LUL guess ill go buy it
[1:57:51] <Daxrin> The damn phone calls.
[1:57:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> The slow motion trainwreck?
[1:57:53] <Flare3500> I don't know 5/10 not much anime titties
[1:57:53] <fuji_92> yup
[1:57:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> all of it really
[1:57:59] <%kewlmyc> @WoolieVersus The dev was in chat at one point
[1:58:03] <%livlinn> sbfpBaz
[1:58:14] <AnneSQF> Fucking up the cooking is very in-character
[1:58:15] <+Superbro64> not as ear tearing as pat mad it out to be, honestly
[1:58:16] <+RyTYoung> OOF
[1:58:19] <%JustToWatch> @docseuss still here or are you frantically fixing the bug Woolie found
[1:58:20] <penitentpendant> "Hitchcock-ian"
[1:58:23] <+Superbro64> *eye tearing
[1:58:26] <CappuccinoGuil> This is a game that asks you "is it too late to do the right thing?"
[1:58:28] <leith_aziz> I missed the begginning, but this sorta writing would bump it to a 8 - 9/10
[1:58:28] <+astrofalcon1> the call did it
[1:58:30] <+Superbro64> sad all the same tho
[1:58:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:58:31] <Mr_Zero5232> @superbro64 surprise surprise
[1:58:32] <@Menitta> I got hit by both
[1:58:34] <aiutare47> Yeah, call did it for me
[1:58:34] <Asuterisuku> Chat, it's OK to cry.
[1:58:46] <fuji_92> yeah both back to back got me
[1:58:47] <%livlinn> Both shiaCry
[1:58:51] <leith_aziz> I appreciate writing this good. Its why I loved The Witcher 3 so much
[1:58:52] <DatAsuna> I don't, but I appreciate the story
[1:58:54] <Jashter18> Yeah those calls are FUUUUUUUUUUCK
[1:58:54] <+astrofalcon1> or if you don't get a chance to say goodbye
[1:58:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> emotional bodyslam
[1:58:58] <UncleOliver> recently, it's awful
[1:59:02] <leith_aziz> But this though, it feels so relatable
[1:59:03] <%kewlmyc> Alzheimer's is a bitch.
[1:59:04] <coldfire0007> I want to see Woolie and Reggie play more sad games
[1:59:06] <+678saintglock> daddy issues pain NotLikeThis
[1:59:06] <bitterssweets> man the relationship with the son and dad hit REALLY close to home
[1:59:07] <aiutare47> My father and grandfather ARE this guy. Farmers who would rather die than tell people how they feel or what’s going on.
[1:59:12] <leith_aziz> The Phone, graveand Tree talk
[1:59:14] <+Superbro64> @asuterisuku things *can* be sad but not enact a visible response
[1:59:16] <+nabs2099> @superbro64 Yeah I agree. it didn't do much for me in that sense but I can totally see how it can. There's definitely moments that are fucked. I related more to the son during the phone call though cos I've been that son, never been the dad. and I hope I never have to.
[1:59:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> The Irony hits really hard during the call
[1:59:26] <Flare3500> Honestly I think it was too late for him to believe in hell and repent and stuff , should've waited till 94 to kill yourself for the PS1
[1:59:29] <+DenpaDev> Video games can only be fun guys stop having feelings and thoughts
[1:59:30] <%akuda_bar> disco elysium is like... a hundred of these moments in a row
[1:59:33] <leith_aziz> I can get the son being angry
[1:59:47] <%Noonoox12> @akuda_bar the DE playthrough's gonna rock
[1:59:47] <%livlinn> Karma is a biiiiiiiitch NotLikeThis
[1:59:48] <leith_aziz> I feel bad for both of them
[1:59:52] <%JustToWatch> He can't open everything, that would put the son in danger
[1:59:54] <+Superbro64> the calm nature of the story, and it not being super melodramatic, is kinda why my reaction is neutral
[1:59:54] <prime_name> I'm still grieving over my dog recently passing. Shit sucks man.
[1:59:57] <khalcatto> he can't open up.. the are listening the phone
[1:59:59] <aiutare47> Absolutely my family. It’s fucking brutal
[1:59:59] <JoshManVGH> Did you see the thought about the line being tapped?
[1:59:59] <+astrofalcon1> man with little hope loses little bit of hope he has
[2:00:01] <%Exiliator> He was tired of just "keeping on keeping on"
[2:00:02] <fancypanzer> the future heartbreak of the people he called realizing that was the last conversation
[2:00:05] <+luftraumm1> @akuda_bar disco elysium is the pinnacle of narrative gaming
[2:00:07] <+678saintglock> as soon as they got into the son i felt that "and i took this personally" moment coming for me
[2:00:13] <fuji_92> yeah saying everything would put ppl in danger
[2:00:21] <+Jiggisnipe> @Superbro64 I'm glad it's not melodramatic, so much better
[2:00:22] <BaronVonProlix> if he told the son, the mob would probably go after him just because he knows
[2:00:24] <twoto858> There will be no funeral
[2:00:31] <leith_aziz> Since he got no conclusion
[2:00:34] <BaronVonProlix> "two can keep a secret if one is dead"
[2:00:36] <Asuterisuku> Fed to his own pigs.
[2:00:39] <%kewlmyc> He got offed by a hitman. I doubt there's a funeral.
[2:00:39] <%JaseAdrift> at the start you kinda figure out real quick that the mob doesnt want him gone
[2:00:40] <+Superbro64> I appreciate how well this is told, to be honest. this is quite a well told story
[2:00:41] <Flare3500> He got eaten by pigs so no funeral
[2:00:45] <+Jiggisnipe> well that's their last phone call
[2:00:47] <kulmoth> there will be no funeral, he'll vanish like all the people he vanished
[2:00:50] <DatAsuna> Empty casket
[2:00:59] <leith_aziz> They'll hide the body I think
[2:01:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What funeral?
[2:01:03] <+Superbro64> solid, very well told story SeemsGood
[2:01:04] <twoto858> No one will know what he did
[2:01:08] <%Exiliator> Pigs nommed him, just like the rest of the meat
[2:01:09] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Why I gotta feel emotions?
[2:01:11] <+Jiggisnipe> what funeral, he's going out of town? Kappa
[2:01:11] <%Lion_kun> Woolie why do you think they'll find a body?
[2:01:11] <+678saintglock> he'd probably be mad because dad lied to him his whole life essentially
[2:01:11] <leith_aziz> He'll be labeled as "missing" most likely
[2:01:13] <penitentpendant> The Light: Buried
[2:01:13] <%X2Eliah> Empty casket funers are a thing
[2:01:17] <jorniev> HE IS GONNA GET PIGS FED
[2:01:18] <%JaseAdrift> He'll just be fed to his pigs like everyone else
[2:01:18] <+SenorCounter> @Flare3500 people have funerals even if there isn't a body.
[2:01:21] <+nabs2099> @akuda_bar Man I wanna play DE SO bad I hope sony makes it free next month cos I got NO money.
[2:01:22] <twoto858> Oh I see
[2:01:23] <+krispen_wa> There won't be a funeral, he parried the bullet frame-perfectly
[2:01:23] <%kewlmyc> Fair enough
[2:01:23] <DatAsuna> Unless the son intends to assume he's missing but coming back for like 30 years
[2:01:23] <%livlinn> Well, an evidence may or may not be found
[2:01:32] <prime_name> Do you think the Hitman buried him under the tree? Like as a friend?
[2:01:36] <leith_aziz> Adios
[2:01:38] <%Lion_kun> 7 years
[2:01:41] <Asuterisuku> Adios
[2:01:42] <elicoy> Woolie what are you wearing?
[2:01:45] <fancypanzer> might even be angry enough to not bother with that ritual
[2:01:46] <leith_aziz> Ados Amigo
[2:01:48] <DatAsuna> You don't need a body for a funeral
[2:01:48] <leith_aziz> Adios
[2:01:49] <@Menitta> He's sleepin with da fishies. He's the night watchman at the aquarium
[2:01:51] <Mr_Zero5232> It’s presumably a small town, in some towns people just not show up one day and you get nothing for answers
[2:01:52] <+SenorCounter> Blood spatter is gonna show something happened.
[2:01:53] <fuji_92> Adios indeed
[2:01:53] <aiutare47> @prime_name No, you hear pigs in the credits
[2:01:56] <DatAsuna> Funerals are for the living
[2:01:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> I assume the pig noises over the credits was him getting fed to the pigs

[2:02:31] <Flare3500> Just torrent everything to save PS3 games
[2:02:36] <Asuterisuku> So have you had a chance to touch Lidia's buttons yet?
[2:02:40] <%JustToWatch> what do you mean, we got to play a game with a guy named Sol in it, that's basically guilty gear
[2:02:41] <leith_aziz> But serious, Sony about to remove PS3 store
[2:02:42] <+PlatinumRevol> barely had any digital ps3 games cause those download speeds would kill me
[2:02:43] <leith_aziz> Crap
[2:02:45] <aiutare47> @prime_name The final knife twist.
[2:02:48] <tacostarvedbeast> i hope disco elysium becomes the woolie reggie podcast i always wanted
[2:02:49] <+vieirat47> the store shutting down is just a report right?

[2:07:43] <%X2Eliah> sounds familiar
[2:07:44] <binaryanomaly16> Woolie, have you ever heard of Crystar? Fairly simple and interesting JRPG about crying anime girls summoning Personas with their tears. I'm playing it myself and loving it so far.
[2:07:47] <Crowmanhunter> @leith_aziz In same vein of Stanely Parable, I recommend Beginner's Guide.

[2:11:54] <KaiserMario> Fights in Tights

[2:12:02] <%livlinn> shiaHypers shiaHypers shiaHypers
[2:12:03] <problemagic> You've talked about this a lot. I'm excited to see some of it.
[2:12:07] <+Bailey__gaming> This game is the best
[2:12:08] <+Proxzo> @KaiserMario I also thought it was Fights in Tights.
[2:12:12] <DedlokPM> @Crowmanhunter he wanted to at one point, which is part of the reason he got into QA, but he never actually got into the actually doing it
[2:12:12] <+nabs2099> I hope this game comes to consoles some day
[2:12:18] <Asuterisuku> Very descriptive of what the game is.
[2:12:19] <+waltzqueen> Pls Cure this depression
[2:12:20] <@Menitta> Oh wait is this that card game?
[2:12:24] <%livlinn> Today’s theme is Men in suits

[2:12:41] <@Squdnate> @Menitta Its that game we same one dude on Discord play one time
[2:12:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Curious how this compares to StS
[2:12:46] <@Squdnate> saw*
[2:12:46] <+Bailey__gaming> it's John wick Fight Scenes meets Super hot in a slay the spire deck builder
[2:12:48] <problemagic> im buckshot
[2:12:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @lloyddboy
[2:12:48] <Louie_Salmon> Superhot + StS + Into the Breach, extremely winning combo
[2:13:03] <+astrofalcon1> he will figure it out
[2:13:06] <DatAsuna> pat wrong again
[2:13:11] <$emptyantics> @louie_salmon The god game
[2:13:30] <problemagic> it's like slay the spire with movement mechanics and sexy super stylized
[2:13:33] <DatAsuna> highlighting aspects vs mannequins
[2:13:34] <+ja07sj> @WoolieVersus It's like Casino Royale's opening
[2:13:39] <Josef_Stryker> Did they already finish Adios?
[2:13:40] <problemagic> yeah that's it. Sin City
[2:13:44] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Hey this game is dope. Slay the Spire meets Into the Breach
[2:13:47] <DedlokPM> @Josef_Stryker yup
[2:13:48] <+docseuss> my codirector figured out how you triggered the dog bug--it's a .1 second window where it's possible, nobody had ever found it before
[2:13:48] <cobalt_phoenix_> @Josef_Stryker ye
[2:13:49] <JoeBecomesJoe> You see it a lot is some older french art too
[2:13:51] <problemagic> very frank miller
[2:13:52] <+Ancisace> Oh man, did I miss everything?
[2:13:53] <Louie_Salmon> I mean in mind control delete they have features, but sure
[2:13:54] <Josef_Stryker> Ok then
[2:13:58] <Komayeda> Fights in Tight Spightses
[2:14:01] <%Lion_kun> It's like the opening of Casino Royale
[2:14:06] <foxname96> LUL
[2:14:08] <problemagic> boom
[2:14:11] <Asuterisuku> Great movie.
[2:14:13] <DedlokPM> @Ancisace not everything. just adios
[2:14:16] <@Menitta> yeeeeee
[2:14:17] <+retro_godfather> hey woolie & chat! retrog77Respect
[2:14:21] <+astrofalcon1> so it's a woolie game
[2:14:22] <%Lion_kun> YOU KNOW MY NAME
[2:14:23] <%SainEdge> its so good Kreygasm
[2:14:25] <%cache_22> It also looks like the Persona 5 Strikers title screen style too.
[2:14:26] <theloganbrand> If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
[2:14:27] <@Menitta> @Squdnate yes
[2:14:30] <foxname96> @docseuss Good game, he liked it
[2:14:32] <+Ancisace> @DedlokPM Awesome, cheers.
[2:14:34] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus How about the "press start" screen for MGS3?
[2:14:36] <Asuterisuku> Arm yourself, because no one else here will save you
[2:14:39] <Komayeda> OH I love that movie
[2:14:51] <+astrofalcon1> chris cornell was a beast
[2:14:54] <@Menitta> I think it was Grisha playing it. This game is cool as fuck
[2:14:56] <masterfire23> that oppenning is pretty dope
[2:14:58] <Asuterisuku> The odds will betray you, and I will replace you
[2:15:07] <problemagic> okay it looks like this
[2:15:19] <%ValentineWolf7> "You Know My Name" was a great opening for sure
[2:15:20] <problemagic> slay inspired
[2:15:22] <passserby> fists up ready to tussle already
[2:15:24] <$emptyantics> “I’m not afraid of you”
[2:15:35] <problemagic> this is my talking stance
[2:15:44] <lloyddboy> TRICK
[2:15:47] <+PishaMashi> royal guard
[2:15:51] <+NarcissistCactus> gunslinger
[2:15:52] <problemagic> GUN SWORD TRICK
[2:15:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> ROYAL GUARD
[2:15:55] <+PishaMashi> quicksliver
[2:15:56] <$emptyantics> GUN
[2:15:58] <OldManDeckardCain> no brazilian ken option? shit game Kappa
[2:16:00] <Asuterisuku> ROYAL
[2:16:02] <+TheFrancix> counter striker sounds sick
[2:16:04] <+PishaMashi> swordmaster
[2:16:06] <masterfire23> also reminds me of superhot
[2:16:09] <Asuterisuku> SWORD
[2:16:12] <tattleworm> aggressive is the only one that matters
[2:16:14] <+MTLxSpider> UNGA UNGA
[2:16:14] <problemagic> batman combat
[2:16:20] <Crowmanhunter> GUTS GLORY GUTS GLORY
[2:16:26] <photion> front kick is the top common imo
[2:16:26] <+Mountaindrewdle> COUNTER STRIKER OR COWARD
[2:16:27] <%Noonoox12> ROYAL GUARD
[2:16:27] <+Rekinsinn> sword
[2:16:29] <+NarcissistCactus> surprising
[2:16:29] <problemagic> yeah boy
[2:16:30] <KaiserMario> of course...
[2:16:31] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> I find Counter Striker deck Globally Offensive KappaHD
[2:16:32] <problemagic> that's the good shit!
[2:16:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ofc you like royal guard LUL
[2:16:45] <problemagic> @LeRouch_the_Rebel i'm telling your mom
[2:16:55] <aiutare47> Let the opponent tire themselves out
[2:17:10] <problemagic> Can you edit the deck?
[2:17:11] <masterfire23> I prefer my counter striker from the source
[2:17:12] <problemagic> Cool
[2:17:16] <Asuterisuku> Member of the Royal Guard as always.
[2:17:28] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> @masterfire23 woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[2:17:48] <%ZweihanderSteve> haha too hype to sync LUL woolieYE
[2:17:50] <Louie_Salmon> @problemagic Edit in the slay the spire way, yeah. And they plan to add a "draft mode" as well
[2:18:09] <+astrofalcon1> "training"
[2:18:33] <Louie_Salmon> Relics, basically
[2:18:49] <$emptyantics> Relics neat
[2:18:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now i'm curious, could a yakuza-themed version of this game work?
[2:19:03] <DedlokPM> @problemagic as you advance you get more cards and can remove cards from your pool
[2:19:03] <+astrofalcon1> yes
[2:19:11] <problemagic> Cool!
[2:19:15] <DedlokPM> in the run
[2:19:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> @cobalt_phoenix_ I don't see why not
[2:19:23] <Louie_Salmon> @cobalt_phoenix_ Wouldn't be surprised if the next Yakuza game was grid-based tactics-like
[2:19:25] <problemagic> my sister was only born with 10 life
[2:19:27] <+astrofalcon1> a yakuza could work like this @cobalt_phoenix_
[2:19:30] <+Reisadan> Instead of this game, you should play Wrestling Impact, or as it is called, "Tights in Fight Spaces"
[2:19:34] <MikeyxStyles> joetioFreaky joetioFreaky
[2:19:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice that'd be interesting
[2:19:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:19:41] <problemagic> angery
[2:19:42] <AnneSQF> Wait, did he do a sync test? Did I just blank out?
[2:19:54] <problemagic> oh yeah he did one
[2:19:56] <problemagic> it ruled
[2:20:02] <+Ancisace> Favourite of the Fighting doctrine terms was FISH: Fighting in Someone's House
[2:20:06] <%rottingpastry> What's the 2-2?
[2:20:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> oh man how much did i miss?
[2:20:20] <problemagic> distance?
[2:20:26] <Louie_Salmon> You can even kill bosses at full health like that. It RULES
[2:20:27] <+MTLxSpider> COMBOS

[2:20:34] <+retro_godfather> ring out!
[2:20:35] <GarbageNirvana> Ah, Into The Breach rules

[2:20:44] <%rottingpastry> I can tell it's range, but why is it two numbers?
[2:20:46] <Blank9> metal gear acid had a lot of things like that, kicking someone over a railing never got old
[2:20:51] <+MTLxSpider> watch out mr president !!
[2:20:51] <problemagic> GUN?>
[2:21:02] <+SammyOVision> @rottingpastry Minimum and Maximum Range, IE, you can only use this move on things 2 tiles away.
[2:21:13] <problemagic> style meter gotta keep that going
[2:21:19] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah exactly @sammyovision
[2:21:20] <%rottingpastry> That makes sense
[2:21:22] <foxname96> DO COMBO
[2:21:23] <problemagic> does getting hit kill the combo?
[2:21:24] <T_Sasquatch> Do combo
[2:21:35] <DedlokPM> @rottingpastry minimum distance-max distance
[2:21:37] <BlackermanZX> do combo the game
[2:22:01] <problemagic> oh no that guy is going to shoot his friend!
[2:22:02] <hassanico2> Gun guys are trigger happy morons, got it
[2:22:04] <hassanico2> LUL
[2:22:06] <problemagic> is he okay?
[2:22:14] <Louie_Salmon> Exactly like Into the Breach
[2:22:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damn this is cool
[2:22:26] <DedlokPM> @problemagic he's just sleeping. ronanSmeel
[2:22:27] <+MTLxSpider> damn
[2:22:32] <+MTLxSpider> thats kinda nuts
[2:22:37] <%livlinn> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:22:40] <problemagic> can't wait to see the playback i bet that's neat
[2:22:43] <hassanico2> Thing is in this game you can never really take hits
[2:22:44] <%ZweihanderSteve> you can almost say that was a fight in a tight space woolieYE
[2:22:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @problemagic rubber bullets its ok
[2:22:49] <problemagic> @DedlokPM thank you i was worried
[2:23:12] <problemagic> PERFECTO
[2:23:18] <Louie_Salmon> @problemagic It's really clean, especially for being early access. And tons of unique animations
[2:23:22] <naoi0> Puzzle game with RNG choices
[2:23:23] <hassanico2> Where's their turn number? I can't find it
[2:23:38] <naoi0> @hassanico2 Top left, they appear as the cursor hovers over them
[2:23:39] <Asuterisuku> It only exists when he has them selected.
[2:23:41] <problemagic> top left when they're hilighted
[2:23:42] <+MTLxSpider> @hassanico2 when u target them it shows up who goes first
[2:23:44] <hassanico2> ah
[2:23:58] <+MTLxSpider> lol
[2:24:25] <problemagic> INTO THE ROPES
[2:24:27] <$emptyantics> What happens if you run out of cards?
[2:24:27] <AnneSQF> Block the gun
[2:24:30] <Asuterisuku> Do other enemies count as a wall or barrier?
[2:24:39] <naoi0> @emptyantics Then your turn ends and you redraw next turn
[2:24:49] <problemagic> you'd do that to a dude with glasses?
[2:24:55] <naoi0> @Asuterisuku Unfortunately no :/
[2:25:09] <hassanico2> Yeah you really can't afford to get hit outside block builds
[2:25:11] <problemagic> aikido but video games
[2:25:13] <naoi0> I played through the demo a few times but have yet to touch the whole game so I could be wrong lol
[2:25:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does block work on guns
[2:25:20] <hassanico2> yes
[2:25:21] <naoi0> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yeh
[2:25:24] <+joltron3030> @cobalt_phoenix_ yes
[2:25:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol cool
[2:25:25] <Prevot> block the bullet
[2:25:28] <Louie_Salmon> Slay the Spire is very different in that respect, there is absolutely a concept of "expected damage"
[2:25:36] <naoi0> Blocking is basically armor that can stack
[2:25:48] <naoi0> But only lasts for a turn if I remember correctly yeah
[2:25:48] <hassanico2> It expires once your turn is over unless otherwise stated
[2:26:07] <+RealThiele> gotta find barricade or calipers LUL
[2:26:09] <Louie_Salmon> There are some specific card to keep block and stack it up
[2:26:29] <Louie_Salmon> @realthiele Literally yes, lots of shared cards like that
[2:26:45] <+MTLxSpider> tiger knee
[2:26:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:27:02] <Asuterisuku> Needed to save Focus for here.
[2:27:27] <+joltron3030> rising knee will bop gun guy out of bounds
[2:27:38] <naoi0> Stepping back to prepare a jump kick
[2:28:03] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, and multi-hit cards up combo multiple times. Took me a while to realize that
[2:28:12] <Asuterisuku> Training is now locked.
[2:28:13] <hassanico2> Oooh, finished 3 campaigns already?
[2:28:28] <+Infernal_Dalek> This is released? I played the fairly girthy demo
[2:28:36] <naoi0> @Infernal_Dalek Yeah the full game is out
[2:28:45] <+MTLxSpider> this sint first time he plays yeah
[2:28:49] <+MTLxSpider> iant*
[2:28:57] <%BestTeaMaker> @Infernal_Dalek early access
[2:29:01] <Louie_Salmon> @infernal_dalek Well, in early access, but yes it's out and still girthy.
[2:29:04] <naoi0> $25
[2:29:06] <naoi0> UD
[2:29:08] <naoi0> USD*
[2:29:27] <+MTLxSpider> LUL
[2:29:29] <hassanico2> It confuses me not all enemies are shaded the same red
[2:29:42] <naoi0> It kind of helps to like classify enemy types but yeah
[2:30:14] <+Infeirno23> woolie is playing a deck building rogue lite? is he gonna turn bald next lionNice
[2:30:24] <naoi0> Mhmfh, the soundtrack for this game is understated but I like it.
[2:30:39] <Louie_Salmon> Now, time to criticize card order that makes him take 1 damage
[2:30:46] <hassanico2> Counter build is super cool
[2:31:09] <Louie_Salmon> It just sucks that some enemies are unlockable, so you can't lean into it all the way
[2:31:13] <hassanico2> Poor Vinny got flung out into a death zone on a great run
[2:31:42] <hassanico2> SHOVE
[2:31:44] <+GenesisKnight> "I'm an idiot" - Woolie Madden, 2021
[2:31:45] <hassanico2> LUL
[2:31:46] <%TheGreatSunbro> Of ourse that'd happen to vinny
[2:31:50] <Deko_> yeet LUL
[2:31:52] <ToneBacas> get outta my house
[2:32:01] <Louie_Salmon> Perfect
[2:32:10] <hassanico2> @TheGreatSunbro it was like 2 perfectly lined gunshots too
[2:32:14] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> although, good vinny noise when the torch man hit his own man
[2:32:16] <%TheGreatSunbro> Oh MAN
[2:32:22] <%TheGreatSunbro> That hurts me
[2:32:45] <hassanico2> It's too bad they still move in a grid LUL
[2:32:47] <Blank9> super
[2:32:49] <Blank9> hot
[2:32:50] <%Noonoox12> not the best angle, tho
[2:32:52] <hassanico2> Like I love the replay but it's a bit jank
[2:32:52] <T_Sasquatch> It's not as smooth as i wanted it to be
[2:33:00] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> They could've made the replay a lliittllee smoother but it's still awesome
[2:33:00] <%ZweihanderSteve> OH MY GOD ITS THE ACE COMBAT POST MISSION REVIEW FHXK HES
[2:33:08] <+Ancisace> Yeah, too pausey
[2:33:10] <hassanico2> Yeah it still rules
[2:33:15] <+CarlosEoM> and make it faster
[2:33:16] <Johannen> Looks jank, not as smooth as you want it to be
[2:33:21] <%jepupu> Are those euros or pounds?
[2:33:22] <@Solidus_113> Ace Combat and Katana Zero
[2:33:25] <Louie_Salmon> But then when I'm on hour 1,000 I will want that off. So it should be default on with an option.
[2:33:25] <hassanico2> Maybe a 1.25x speed modifier on it would help
[2:33:27] <ECRead> and speed it up a tad
[2:33:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Make it like Katana Zero
[2:33:41] <BackwardCap> Its jank because they still move in a grid like fashion.
[2:33:44] <+Ancisace> Looks like a £ drawn slightly weird
[2:33:50] <ToneBacas> if the moves chained together more fluidly it would be amazing
[2:33:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:33:51] <hassanico2> Yeah it's pounds
[2:33:53] <+Superbro64> there's a solid tic in between anims. Those "tics" should be removed to make it feel more seemless imho
[2:33:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Phantom Brigade does it every turn
[2:33:58] <hassanico2> You're fake MI6
[2:34:02] <Louie_Salmon> @alteisenreisez Or yeah just play in the background of the menu and you can close the menu to look, yeah
[2:34:44] <Louie_Salmon> Book of Stabbing
[2:34:49] <+MTLxSpider> thats smart
[2:35:20] <+Infernal_Dalek> What about the injury? Doesn't happen through block?
[2:35:34] <hassanico2> Nope
[2:35:37] <+MTLxSpider> "graveyard" reggiethe ygo player
[2:35:41] <Louie_Salmon> @infernal_dalek Yeah a full block stops it
[2:35:41] <hassanico2> Block will block anything unless stated
[2:35:53] <+Ancisace> @Infernal_Dalek Only if some damage is not blocked
[2:36:02] <Louie_Salmon> This is the power of the counter deck, staying still and just jabbing everyone
[2:36:15] <+MTLxSpider> Damn he's good
[2:36:15] <Komayeda> THROAT PUNCH
[2:36:21] <hassanico2> I love the Dodge card
[2:36:26] <%AyotoCorp> Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
[2:36:37] <hassanico2> Nice ragdoll LUL
[2:36:56] <deadbrainpl> Ha, I just finished this game today! Really good stuff, the last missions strain my last braincells to a breaking point
[2:37:05] <+Infernal_Dalek> Woolie with the passive-fist playthrough
[2:37:09] <heartlesshealer> the yakuza heat move ends your combo

[2:37:23] <BlackermanZX> brutal
[2:37:44] <+MTLxSpider> if they kept the blood. that'd be rad
[2:37:45] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> music is good

[2:38:09] <+rrratbastard> thanks yo @DrJamesWoods
[2:38:17] <naoi0> Build up dat combo count for huge damage moves
[2:38:21] <$emptyantics> Imagine if they added a rival character that would take the path you don’t and at the end of the level you have to fight him
[2:38:23] <deadbrainpl> It's got all the agent fighting adversaries really
[2:38:51] <Louie_Salmon> Can you mess with the camera angle?
[2:38:59] <naoi0> This is a pretty dope action replay
[2:39:00] <Louie_Salmon> I forget if there's controls to change it
[2:39:07] <+PlushMines> Yoooo I’m stoked to see you play this
[2:39:07] <%ZweihanderSteve> LMAO
[2:39:11] <%DrJamesWoods> lol
[2:39:12] <+rrratbastard> this one was a good fight tbh
[2:39:12] <Ultimatefool> Amazing
[2:39:12] <Deko_> too violent
[2:39:14] <hassanico2> Replay looked better this time
[2:39:18] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Nice Boat

[2:39:22] <+Ancisace> Super. Hot. Super. Hot.
[2:39:25] <heartlesshealer> Nice Boat
[2:39:26] <hassanico2> I think movement is what makes replays look the dumbest
[2:39:29] <+waltzqueen> Nice Boat
[2:39:38] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah if you do multiple moves without moving, it totally does string them together.
[2:39:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @PrinceMech
[2:39:42] <+GenesisKnight> Euros?
[2:39:54] <%PrinceMech> Pounds
[2:40:02] <%PrinceMech> 'cause you're giving 'em a pounding.
[2:40:04] <+GenesisKnight> looked like an E to me
[2:40:05] <%TheGreatSunbro> Yo bro gt a helmet on
[2:40:05] <naoi0> Ahhh I hate the extra objective levels
[2:40:11] <+Ancisace> I think it's a pound sign drawn to look plausibly euro
[2:40:11] <hassanico2> Suitcase...
[2:40:11] <matrix_sfrj> 2many ballsacks in the same plac at the same time im strugglin to breath
[2:40:16] <+RyTYoung> I missed it
[2:40:27] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[2:40:48] <hassanico2> Ah, no push
[2:40:52] <naoi0> Passive defense
[2:40:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[2:40:54] <Louie_Salmon> Also the music is good, for no reason
[2:41:01] <@Solidus_113> yo this music
[2:41:12] <Louie_Salmon> No business having a banger, but there it is
[2:42:05] <dukenux> damn, i missed Adios
[2:42:31] <hassanico2> Them getting back up after Head Smash is so goofy LUL
[2:42:58] <%holydeviant1> Man, this game is so good
[2:43:08] <GarbageNirvana> AAAA got struck by lightning
[2:43:19] <+RyTYoung> Fat Boy Slim write this? Kappa
[2:43:23] <Louie_Salmon> Counter deck doesn't have a ton of movement, hard to do the briefcase ones
[2:43:24] <%holydeviant1> Can't wait for the game to finish and get mods so people can crossover StS with it
[2:43:37] <Onamar> Step back, kick, dash
[2:43:47] <pi_in_the_sci> to dash
[2:43:48] <MikeyxStyles> music got me like joetioChugs joetioChugs
[2:44:05] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> going to need a HITMAN voicepack mod
[2:44:06] <Louie_Salmon> @holydeviant1 Duuuuuude gotta get the Watcher in here
[2:44:12] <+Pugweight> im downloading the game rn
[2:44:19] <Louie_Salmon> Superhot mod
[2:44:20] <$emptyantics> @holydeviant1 A remake of StS in this engine Kreygasm
[2:44:32] <hassanico2> Is there something like Separate for right angles?
[2:44:46] <%holydeviant1> Silent in FiTS
[2:44:52] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's live info
[2:44:53] <naoi0> @hassanico2 Uhh, there's like the side kicks which pushes the enemy left or right?
[2:44:55] <%holydeviant1> My stabby waifu
[2:45:08] <hassanico2> But nothing for 2 enemies right? @naoi0
[2:45:09] <AvianGenesis> AvianGenesis subscribed with Prime.
[2:45:20] <%holydeviant1> alternatively, Mr. Fits in StS
[2:45:34] <Louie_Salmon> @hassanico2 There's basically a move for every obvious way you could think to move yourself or enemies
[2:45:37] <naoi0> @hassanico2 Oh nah I don't think so. Again I've only played the demo but in like trying to push an enemy into another one it wouldn't do anything
[2:45:51] <+LokimenD> is this Metal Gear Ac!d?
[2:45:54] <striderzer0> why does push card look like he pushing Pat
[2:46:01] <SixthShinx> He's gonna send ya to flavortown
[2:46:06] <hassanico2> The boss of campaign 1 is a fat biker Pat
[2:46:08] <deadbrainpl> Pushing enemies into each other does damage them, just like hitting a wall (so 4 damage)
[2:46:19] <+PlushMines> Woolie is so good
[2:47:29] <Louie_Salmon> Slip is such a crazy good card, I want like 5 copies in every deck
[2:47:47] <Brothermanhyll> south park fractured but whole looks different than I remember
[2:50:29] <dundore77> so are these all khimari? all they do is push?
[2:50:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:50:33] <%TheGreatSunbro> KICKS

[2:51:43] <+EternalInquisitor> He super does!
[2:51:44] <+waltzqueen> YE NOT GUILTY
[2:51:49] <DrBeanie> this is kinda sick
[2:51:51] <+PlushMines> SAME
[2:51:52] <DomonTrigger> Cast in the name of God
[2:51:54] <oAznoUta> Roger Smith, fuck yeah
[2:51:56] <Brothermanhyll> I'll make YOU lose your memories
[2:51:58] <jorkoal> oooow hook kick looks sick
[2:52:02] <%TheBensonator_> YEYEYE
[2:52:03] <+PlushMines> Every time I see this game I think about Big O
[2:52:05] <+FreddyLeeSavage> @DrJamesWoods Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:52:20] <%TheBensonator_> Kick some ass then have a sick cyborg play the piano for you
[2:52:40] <+Infernal_Dalek> I love making enemies shoot each other; I once spent like 20 turns in a small room with 2 armed guys, lol.
[2:52:52] <Asuterisuku> 120 pounds? That's expensive!
[2:52:57] <Brothermanhyll> here's hoping the game has an oldboy hallway
[2:53:23] <GarbageNirvana> It has to, right
[2:53:27] <+Infernal_Dalek> I feel like I need to see Oldboy
[2:53:38] <+Infernal_Dalek> Question is...which streaming service has it? lol
[2:53:44] <Brothermanhyll> netflix has it
[2:53:51] <$emptyantics> Oi, you’ve a loicence fo that card?
[2:53:57] <naoi0> The blowtorch guys and the big fat area guys are the worst
[2:53:58] <deadbrainpl> Maybe not a hallway per se, but it does have long stages
[2:54:06] <theyblamedthebeasts> looks like xcom: superhot
[2:54:15] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Exacly
[2:54:28] <naoi0> @theyblamedthebeasts At least every hit is assured rather than missing on a 99% chance to hit
[2:54:47] <Brothermanhyll> Oldboy is good but the REAL fights in tight spaces movie is Raid and Raid 2
[2:54:47] <%jonblnt> the answer lies in the heart of the cards
[2:55:06] <%TheBensonator_> Something something believe in your grandpa’s deck
[2:55:27] <Louie_Salmon> @naoi0 Yeah them getting free armor is honestly annoying, have to focus or burst them
[2:55:27] <Asuterisuku> Yugi's deck was trash though.
[2:55:30] <%saladin1911> I swear I've been meaning to watch the Raid movies for years now
[2:55:35] <naoi0> My grandpa's deck has no useless cards. What it does have... is the forbidden pieces of exodia!
[2:55:38] <someyounguy1> oh this game is rad! im so glad to see you playing it!
[2:55:42] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> vineSchut
[2:55:48] <deadbrainpl> Can't wait until they add the ability to build your own deck in this game, I'll be able to dome obscene builds
[2:55:53] <%TheBensonator_> MY GRANDPAS DECK HAS NO CARDS, KAINA
[2:55:59] <%TheBensonator_> KAIBA, EVEN
[2:56:17] <Brothermanhyll> i dont even have a grandpa
[2:56:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @naoi0
[2:56:39] <lloyddboy> throat him LUL
[2:56:39] <%TheGreatSunbro> Throat Him Woolie
[2:56:41] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> "throat him"
[2:56:42] <+FuqBoiSlim> THROAT HIM???
[2:56:44] <+GenesisKnight> Thoat him LUL
[2:56:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WHAT HIM?
[2:56:48] <+678saintglock> throat him? damn
[2:56:50] <%TheBensonator_> T H R O A T
[2:56:50] <naoi0> Deep throat?!
[2:56:50] <+Ancisace> I like where this is going :3
[2:56:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> I didn't think it was this kind of stream
[2:56:57] <Garry_Guyface> Ahh, the stream with Milking and Throating
[2:57:01] <%saladin1911> Sometimes you just gotta throat a man
[2:57:03] <PMda2nd> they allow that?
[2:57:07] <TheBensonator_> C E N S O R E D
[2:57:13] <+678saintglock> throat monster
[2:57:15] <naoi0> That's allowed on twitch?
[2:57:15] <Garry_Guyface> Glass him, then milk and throat
[2:57:40] <%TheBensonator_> Woolie the Throat God
[2:57:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:58:08] <naoi0> The ragdoll
[2:58:49] <Louie_Salmon> Ooh I think there's a good plan here
[2:58:54] <Brothermanhyll> wish you could do sleeping dogs-style environmental executions
[2:59:00] <Brothermanhyll> just shove the guy into that motorcycle
[2:59:08] <Brothermanhyll> and turn it on or something i dunno
[2:59:09] <GarbageNirvana> For some reason this song reminds me of that DDR song in Later Alligator
[3:00:27] <MasterTonberry23> this reminds me most of into the breach
[3:00:27] <naoi0> Not sure if they added it or not but I think it'd be dope if there were like different altitudes so you can do a dive kick or something.
[3:00:34] <%TheGreatSunbro> Spin kick, step, dash out?
[3:00:40] <Onamar> Spin step dash back jump
[3:00:51] <pi_in_the_sci> left spin, step, head smash
[3:00:59] <%ChoculaUltra> danjer
[3:01:03] <Louie_Salmon> That works too, yeah
[3:02:40] <Asuterisuku> What if you push him, step in front and then block?
[3:02:53] <Louie_Salmon> The last class is great because it starts with a piece of card draw, much more consistent
[3:03:00] <Onamar> Snap strike first
[3:03:28] <%rottingpastry> step, front kick into can, quick strike imo
[3:03:44] <naoi0> 24 damage with the combo counter?
[3:03:54] <naoi0> I think that'd kill
[3:03:59] <%TheGreatSunbro> Nuke him
[3:04:07] <Louie_Salmon> 4 damage is probably worth it for the time reward, yeah
[3:04:13] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Full meter
[3:04:15] <%rottingpastry> ah yeah
[3:04:18] <%TheGreatSunbro> Bop
[3:04:22] <Ultimatefool> DONK
[3:04:23] <+waltzqueen> WASTED
[3:04:24] <naoi0> Just fell limp like a board
[3:04:52] <+jaguarkek318> jab for the win
[3:04:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:05:00] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> nice boat
[3:05:01] <Asuterisuku> I feel like the animation could be shown more fluidly.
[3:05:02] <WG101> too hot for twitch
[3:05:04] <%TheGreatSunbro> Can't show that in a christian spy show
[3:05:11] <Asuterisuku> But it's still a cool concept.
[3:05:15] <Louie_Salmon> StS is more generous with healing, since you can't just dodge things
[3:05:18] <GarbageNirvana> That's a jiggly flame
[3:05:21] <naoi0> OHhhh that's new
[3:05:23] <josukecrazydiamonnd> no Arkham City?
[3:05:40] <+rrratbastard> power through... we ironclad now
[3:05:43] <Komayeda> I dunno, maybe later
[3:05:49] <GarbageNirvana> Gotta give the Arkham games some breathing room
[3:06:01] <Asuterisuku> He only just did Asylum, City probably won't be until after Half-Life 2 - and especially won't be happening before Disco Elysium.
[3:06:03] <%saladin1911> @josukecrazydiamonnd Nah. He's going through short games for now until Disco Elysium
[3:06:17] <%rottingpastry> lol coin flip on forever shit card
[3:06:21] <pi_in_the_sci> coin flip
[3:06:22] <naoi0> Oh shit he's going to do disco elysium when the final update is out?
[3:06:28] <TundraOW> RISK REWARD
[3:06:29] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah they can be very bad
[3:06:31] <Ultimatefool> Cripple coin flip
[3:06:39] <Garry_Guyface> Risk it!
[3:06:44] <hassanico2> The ? Events are fucking insane
[3:06:47] <Louie_Salmon> Some aren't a big deal, some are legit the end of the run
[3:06:47] <naoi0> @saladin1911 Nice! He's doing disco elysium? Who with?
[3:06:52] <hassanico2> A lot of them are waaay too much risk for reward
[3:06:57] <MasterTonberry23> very ftl
[3:06:58] <Garry_Guyface> aww
[3:07:05] <%rottingpastry> no regerts
[3:07:06] <+RealThiele> curses get fucked
[3:07:16] <Adwark> That's the nature of rougelike/rougelite games.
[3:07:21] <+klooswep> Death? I sleep. Long-term injury? real shit
[3:07:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah so you actually gain momentum
[3:08:06] <zazzera01> been playing too much slay the spire. this looks interesting
[3:08:06] <%saladin1911> £35 looking like my actual bank account LUL NotLikeThis BibleThump
[3:08:22] <%rottingpastry> you're broke
[3:08:41] <Louie_Salmon> Hammerfist is sorta nuts upgraded
[3:08:51] <Onamar> Free upgrade
[3:08:56] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye
[3:09:01] <+b_aleph> aay its rocky's gym
[3:09:04] <+GenesisKnight> It's free real estate
[3:09:10] <naoi0> No debt here
[3:09:12] <+RealThiele> hobo powers
[3:09:23] <jorkoal> I see this as an absolute win
[3:10:38] <%saladin1911> What's with bald thug Santa?
[3:10:40] <hassanico2> CHONKS
[3:10:40] <lloyddboy> CHUNGUS
[3:10:43] <Ultimatefool> CHONKERS
[3:10:51] <@Menitta> w i d e
[3:11:04] <+waltzqueen> BODE
[3:11:11] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> SIZE OF LAD
[3:11:12] <Komayeda> Slip then Seperate?
[3:11:20] <%rottingpastry> slip and push him so he hits both those guys?
[3:11:41] <naoi0> @saladin1911 Oh god, the bald santas in this game are beasts.
[3:11:47] <+RealThiele> the being able to force enemies into their own abilities is pretty stylish and different from StS
[3:11:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Damn
[3:11:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[3:12:19] <%TheBensonator_> L A R I A T O
[3:12:24] <hassanico2> Would you wear Tights in Fight Spaces though?
[3:12:30] <MasterTonberry23> kinda wanna play yakuza music over this :D
[3:12:31] <MikeyxStyles> joetioGlasses joetioGlasses
[3:12:33] <%rottingpastry> all the block in the world
[3:12:39] <PMda2nd> since this is my 1st time seeing this game, is it like a free for all?
[3:12:43] <+RealThiele> like a dragon combat music right now would be sick
[3:12:50] <naoi0> @pmda2126 It's 1 v many
[3:13:10] <%rottingpastry> push into table
[3:13:10] <deadbrainpl> @pmda2126 Enemies are all against you but you can make them hit their allies if you position them that way
[3:13:30] <Komayeda> that's great
[3:13:35] <PMda2nd> @naoi0 ok, I was confused with the guy shooting his own partner
[3:13:45] <naoi0> Ahhh yeah read what deadbrainpl said
[3:13:58] <PMda2nd> @deadbrainpl ok cool, thanks
[3:14:07] <MasterTonberry23> it actualy plays out a lot like into the breach
[3:14:21] <naoi0> No undo button tho.
[3:14:24] <deadbrainpl> No probs, no greater feeling than clearing out a few enemies without throwing a single attack
[3:14:25] <vnzuelandude> I just claimed Sigma Series Parazon Skin! Thanks for the Drops @Warframe
[3:14:27] <Onamar> Does left spin cost momentum?
[3:14:33] <LoneFonte> wait what
[3:14:39] <naoi0> @Onamar Yeah, 2 momentum
[3:14:49] <%rottingpastry> quick strike, left spin kick, dash?
[3:14:52] <UrsusDerpus> No it costs combo
[3:14:54] <deadbrainpl> @Onamar combo moves are free, unless they have a momentum cost
[3:15:03] <naoi0> Oh wait woops I misread sorry
[3:15:30] <deadbrainpl> It's fine, like all roguelikes this game needs you to learn it's ruleset but it's quickly readable once you get used to it
[3:15:36] <UrsusDerpus> Yeah
[3:15:58] <UrsusDerpus> I haven’t encountered any combo moves that also use momentum though
[3:16:43] <pi_in_the_sci> snap first
[3:16:46] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Howdy, Folks.
[3:16:51] <naoi0> The games like a fairly intuitive learn as you go kind of model
[3:16:54] <naoi0> Hey there!
[3:17:12] <%ezgoldar> have you used your pot of greed yet?
[3:17:40] <pi_in_the_sci> snap strike is free and should go first
[3:17:42] <naoi0> I think there's cards in this game that let you like replace stuff/discard part of your hand to redraw? I could be wrong.
[3:17:42] <someyounguy1> but what does pot of greed do?
[3:17:46] <deadbrainpl> This game really activates your almonds
[3:18:02] <naoi0> ded
[3:18:03] <someyounguy1> @naoi0 ive seen ponder. discard a card to draw 3
[3:18:17] <lloyddboy> THROAT
[3:18:32] <DedlokPM> SUPER. PUNCH. SUPER. PUNCH. SUPER. PUNCH.
[3:18:46] <Louie_Salmon> I think that's legit the only card draw in the game. I assume they wanted to avoid infinites so early on
[3:18:51] <naoi0> HIS LEGS
[3:18:55] <Komayeda> WAIT THE REPLAY
[3:18:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:19:15] <naoi0> oh well
[3:19:22] <+GenesisKnight> Vault is pretty Pog
[3:19:57] <UrsusDerpus> There’s ponder, and redraw, which replaces all cards in your hand
[3:20:01] <deadbrainpl> Upgrading your move cards to cost 0 momentum is the best thing
[3:20:06] <Louie_Salmon> I've never picked vault and I probably should, because I get annoyed at shooters hiding from me.
[3:20:11] <tattleworm> vault rules but it breaks the replay if you use it for movement so you might have to esc > quit replay
[3:20:16] <tattleworm> unless they fixed that already
[3:20:18] <+RealThiele> money yooo
[3:20:28] <Louie_Salmon> Depends on the amounts honestly
[3:20:39] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's very worth
[3:20:48] <UrsusDerpus> There’s a couple attack moves that also let you draw cards
[3:20:48] <@Moobot> Shoutouts to new sponsor @ArtesianBuilds! They'll build you a new PC live on http://twitch.tv/artesianbuilds & ship it to you within a week!

[3:20:56] <+RealThiele> good idea to take a shit beforre fighting
[3:21:01] <naoi0> Fighting people in a bathroom is the worst
[3:21:17] <%ezgoldar> theres only 1 stall
[3:21:22] <Louie_Salmon> Oh man shoving that guy can make him have a really bad day
[3:21:28] <UrsusDerpus> Except you get to use the walls and it’s free damage
[3:22:16] <Frog_of_Justic> Kicking people out doors is great. The ragdoll is top tier
[3:22:22] <UrsusDerpus> He’s not gonna turn to you
[3:22:23] <Onamar> Stun dart
[3:22:26] <%saladin1911> Any of you remember Vector? That mobile parkour game? This game is reminding me of that now LUL
[3:22:26] <naoi0> Having to rely on luck at times in this game isn't the greatest but it is satisfying when things line up
[3:22:41] <WG101> @saladin1911 damn... i actually do...
[3:22:51] <+RealThiele> well i mean its a card rpg so rng is kinda baked in
[3:23:04] <%Seancicle> antisocial social distancing
[3:23:09] <GarbageNirvana> More like social fistancing
[3:23:12] <naoi0> ded
[3:23:22] <striderzer0> Pat Mad
[3:23:36] <%saladin1911> @wg101 That game was good shit lmao. I wonder if they made any more. Might have to check later if I remember
[3:23:38] <%TheGreatSunbro> There's something really funny about this dude gettinch shoved out of the room and just being like "well that's that I guess"
[3:23:38] <GarbageNirvana> So this is where AngriestPat went
[3:23:38] <deadbrainpl> At least the game actually makes it so you always draw at least one movement card per turn so you have options to get out of danger (at least that's what I experienced)
[3:23:57] <WG101> @saladin1911 i think shadow fight 3's all the rage with that company now
[3:24:01] <tattleworm> getting your deck total to 2x your hand total (5 normal, 6 aggressive) negates a lot of the rng stuff since you know what'll be in every second hand
[3:24:07] <Louie_Salmon> Almost enough movement
[3:24:37] <Onamar> Head smash then push?
[3:24:46] <%saladin1911> Ah, that's a shame
[3:25:02] <Louie_Salmon> Might honestly just be smash + separate
[3:25:06] <hassanico2> Haha, I'm in Danger
[3:25:24] <%saladin1911> That's a Heat move lmao
[3:25:26] <hassanico2> Smashed so hard he clipped throuh the wall LUL
[3:26:00] <naoi0> Nice
[3:26:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:26:34] <+RealThiele> angle LUL
[3:26:37] <striderzer0> never been clean
[3:26:42] <Louie_Salmon> LUL
[3:26:55] <naoi0> First boss time
[3:27:01] <MasterTonberry23> your dude looks lke phoenix wright, anyone else see it?
[3:27:01] <hassanico2> You should get shadow trails at high combo
[3:27:01] <Louie_Salmon> Swap and grapple are the best
[3:27:03] <hassanico2> It would look cool
[3:27:07] <Rosewater_444> !uptime
[3:27:08] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 34 minutes
[3:27:15] <+RealThiele> human shield time
[3:27:30] <Louie_Salmon> The fact that it's 2 is almost insulting
[3:27:36] <UrsusDerpus> Redirect is amazing too
[3:27:41] <hassanico2> yeah damage is gigantic in this game
[3:27:46] <Louie_Salmon> Like 50 is maybe worth, not the hundo though
[3:27:50] <naoi0> That 2 can mean life or death tho
[3:27:57] <deadbrainpl> By the end enemies are doing 25-30 damage per hit so yeah
[3:28:03] <UrsusDerpus> Swap triggers auto-attack but you don’t need to worry about right now
[3:28:14] <WG101> THAT'S A LOT OF TARGETS
[3:28:15] <hassanico2> Only gotta beat the boss, no one else necessary
[3:28:15] <Spliffdonk> Now the vault opportunity present themselves
[3:28:17] <naoi0> You only need to kill the boss for this, otherwise he'll call on reinforcements
[3:28:23] <%Burdenslo> ZUBAZ!?
[3:28:57] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah killing the boss is an instant completion, I didn't notice that
[3:28:57] <hassanico2> Nasty luck, all the movement cards on the first turn
[3:29:05] <UrsusDerpus> Swap and tank the damage
[3:29:10] <+RealThiele> step swap push into gun
[3:29:25] <naoi0> Nice moves
[3:29:41] <UrsusDerpus> Oh never mind he’s gotta a ton of movement yea just go
[3:30:24] <UrsusDerpus> Shove gun, stun boss
[3:30:40] <Louie_Salmon> Could shove him left and the boss left?
[3:30:49] <UrsusDerpus> Oh well
[3:30:50] <deadbrainpl> Kick gun then shove boss to hit the gun
[3:30:52] <dukenux> This really looks like isometric SuperHot
[3:31:07] <%rottingpastry> does shove not generate combo?
[3:31:17] <%ChoculaUltra> it be ya own homies sometimes
[3:31:24] <UrsusDerpus> Alright, that works
[3:31:32] <naoi0> Yehhh
[3:31:32] <UrsusDerpus> It really do
[3:31:36] <+RealThiele> neck snap
[3:31:39] <Frog_of_Justic> This game is Slay the HOT
[3:31:40] <dukenux> Is dark reed dude like a tougher enemy?
[3:31:43] <dukenux> *red
[3:31:47] <UrsusDerpus> Yes he’s the boss
[3:31:50] <Louie_Salmon> @rottingpastry It does, any card that isn't movement or a spell should
[3:32:05] <naoi0> Oh man I thought the boss was like a hoodie guy, I just now noticed that it's a... beard?
[3:32:11] <DrkJP520> Yo, this looks tight
[3:32:14] <dukenux> footsies
[3:32:16] <UrsusDerpus> Yeah he’s a biker guy
[3:32:19] <Frog_of_Justic> Or SUPERSpire
[3:32:38] <Louie_Salmon> Unfortunate to draw counters on the no attack turn
[3:32:49] <UrsusDerpus> Yeah, and no stun moves
[3:33:05] <WG101> THAT'S A LOT OF DUDES
[3:33:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:33:06] <dukenux> oh shit
[3:33:07] <naoi0> John wick time
[3:33:08] <Asuterisuku> Big uh oh
[3:33:12] <+jaguarkek318> um
[3:33:15] <+RealThiele> big bonk
[3:33:19] <+GenesisKnight> Combo counter right now would be huge
[3:33:23] <+jaguarkek318> dragon install time
[3:33:24] <UrsusDerpus> They don’t matter, just focus the boss
[3:33:59] <naoi0> nice one
[3:34:01] <WG101> WHAT A PLAY
[3:34:01] <jorkoal> niiice
[3:34:05] <Adwark> +20 health D:
[3:34:06] <dukenux> Santa is defeated!
[3:34:07] <+RealThiele> ez every time
[3:34:10] <+jaguarkek318> ez Clap
[3:34:10] <%SainEdge> PogChamp
[3:34:11] <Hammatime8> Gotta love those tasty, tasty double counters!
[3:34:12] <+GenesisKnight> Wrapped like a christmas present
[3:34:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Excellent!
[3:34:25] <Louie_Salmon> Wait was that +20 health like healing or max? I assume healing
[3:34:30] <%nintega010> I wonder what aggresive is like.
[3:34:31] <UrsusDerpus> It’s healing
[3:34:45] <%saladin1911> Sent Santa down to the South Pole LUL
[3:34:52] <Hammatime8> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, healing. It'll say max health if it's a max health boost
[3:35:09] <Louie_Salmon> @nintega010 Deadass wall-run in the starter deck
[3:35:11] <UrsusDerpus> Aggressive is most raw damage, there’s a superman punch that requires a wall to push off of
[3:35:13] <dukenux> Is that Loss?
[3:35:32] <%nintega010> @woolieversus could you try other decks. now or only in new game
[3:35:33] <+MajkirM> MajkirM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Whoa, game looks slick!
[3:35:44] <UrsusDerpus> @louie_salmon the wall run move is in the trickster deck
[3:35:47] <dukenux> Lockpicking Lawyer
[3:35:49] <+Rekinsinn> I like how the agent is in a fighting stance talking with his boss
[3:35:49] <Asuterisuku> Prison fights prison fights
[3:35:52] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah have to start a new game to try another deck
[3:36:09] <+RealThiele> gamblers chip is pog
[3:36:10] <Louie_Salmon> @UrsusDerpus Really? Could have sworn it was aggressive
[3:36:19] <+GenesisKnight> First turn mulligan
[3:36:31] <deadbrainpl> Aggressive has the Wall-Jump punch - the Wall Run Kick is Trickster
[3:36:43] <deadbrainpl> BTW Aggressive is my personal favorite, get that BIG NUMBER
[3:36:50] <+RyTYoung> YO
[3:36:53] <Asuterisuku> Only two tiles wide.
[3:36:53] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah now THIS is a hallway
[3:36:56] <%saladin1911> It's that Metal Gear truck lmao
[3:37:00] <Hammatime8> I like all the decks, but counter and trickster are really winning me over
[3:37:11] <+waltzqueen> @deadbrainpl are you saying trickster is the Jackie Chan moveset?
[3:37:13] <+RealThiele> ooh you can use it after an attack
[3:37:18] <striderzer0> can you get knocked out of bounds?
[3:37:23] <WG101> yes
[3:37:27] <Asuterisuku> They changed how the Mulligan works in Magic.
[3:37:28] <UrsusDerpus> I can’t stand trickster, it doesn’t let me hit hard enough
[3:37:39] <deadbrainpl> @waltzqueen I haven't played it much but it's got a lot of weird shit like discard-and-draw, momentum-to-block, shocking on attack and so on
[3:37:55] <Asuterisuku> I forget what the current etiquette is, actually.
[3:38:17] <NeroInfinite> It can get worse.
[3:39:26] <UrsusDerpus> Aggressive requires Do Combo to get Big Number
[3:39:29] <UrsusDerpus> It’s the best
[3:39:29] <Louie_Salmon> @waltzqueen It also notably starts with 4 momentum a turn, so you're just doing more stuff each turn
[3:40:08] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> I know this is probably not the best time or place to ask, but Hey, Woolie, did you have a chance to see the Shanty Trailer? she's got that Creole/Islander thing goin' on in her voice, which got revealed.
[3:40:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[3:40:09] <deadbrainpl> @UrsusDerpus I might've fucked myself a few times by ending a turn near a wall hoping to do that WallPunch BIG DAMAGE
[3:40:22] <FunnyCrimes> oh this like the police van scene from the night comes for us
[3:40:31] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> for Them's Fightin' herds, I mean. sorry.
[3:41:07] <deadbrainpl> Oblivion Death Animation :)
[3:41:07] <UrsusDerpus> @deadbrainpl I totally get that, but I’m partial to the big back kick myself
[3:41:13] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah these guys are so harsh
[3:41:24] <dukenux> you dont wanna know how he brought that shiv here
[3:41:35] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus any news on getting an ancient gods play throuhg??
[3:41:46] <UrsusDerpus> Shank guy ignores block and he’s the only real real threat to the counter deck
[3:41:54] <Onamar> Head smash will kill
[3:42:05] <Louie_Salmon> I think one other attack in the game ignores block
[3:42:08] <Adwark> Shank guy doesn't seem to have much health
[3:42:22] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah he is at least weak
[3:42:35] <%rottingpastry> quick kick, vault to move 2 beside, head smash?
[3:42:50] <Louie_Salmon> Taunt is fun
[3:42:50] <%rottingpastry> oh okay, it doesn't move forward
[3:42:55] <+glgzephyr> Are you okay?
[3:43:15] <+DonPedroX13> I keep getting screwed at the third stage, dammit!
[3:43:16] <$Spydurman> wouldn't head smash have killed last turn?
[3:43:25] <Onamar> He only had like 18 HP
[3:43:28] <UrsusDerpus> Yes
[3:43:35] <$Spydurman> head smash
[3:43:35] <Asuterisuku> Separate first
[3:43:37] <Hammatime8> @Spydurman Yeah, I think head smash would have been lethal, but hey, whatever
[3:43:38] <Asuterisuku> Front kick has the range.
[3:43:44] <$Spydurman> true
[3:43:44] <Louie_Salmon> Front kick advances, but yeah that'll do it
[3:43:56] <Asuterisuku> Censored!
[3:44:00] <+waltzqueen> Nice Boat
[3:44:02] <UrsusDerpus> That’s fine too
[3:44:13] <UrsusDerpus> Great angle!
[3:44:19] <%TheBensonator_> The replay at the end adds so much FLAVOR to the gameplay
[3:44:21] <+glgzephyr> is this in early access?
[3:44:26] <UrsusDerpus> It is
[3:44:30] <Asuterisuku> IRON BODY
[3:44:32] <Louie_Salmon> Big Bloss
[3:44:33] <+glgzephyr> that explains the camera angles
[3:44:40] <+RealThiele> wide stance boi LUL
[3:44:43] <deadbrainpl> Yes, but it's basically done when it comes to basic gameplay
[3:44:49] <UrsusDerpus> Yup
[3:44:51] <deadbrainpl> They're just adding fixes and other features
[3:44:54] <Grunkle_Dan_> anyone know if theres an elevator level? recreate the scene from Captain America Scene. "Before we begin, anyone wanna get off?"
[3:44:54] <+glgzephyr> yeah just needs polish
[3:45:07] <%TheBensonator_> The art style is good, at the very least
[3:45:10] <deadbrainpl> There is absolutely and elevator battle
[3:45:11] <UrsusDerpus> They said they’re adding another character, I think
[3:45:13] <%jonblnt> Yes it's a great piece of stand up
[3:45:14] <Louie_Salmon> @glgzephyr Some balance issues too, I think that's first on their roadmap
[3:45:20] <%TheBensonator_> Hard to go wrong with the SUPERHOT style here
[3:45:23] <Grunkle_Dan_> @deadbrainpl awesome
[3:45:30] <@Solidus_113> card cost difference
[3:45:36] <UrsusDerpus> Big block is better
[3:45:39] <%rottingpastry> iron body seems situationally very good
[3:45:42] <SixthShinx> Cheaper, but do damage to self
[3:45:50] <%TheBensonator_> psaBig BLOCK
[3:45:54] <%Namillus> Does self-damage ignore your own Block?
[3:45:54] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> in a game where damage is a bitch to get rid off until you get the heal card taking damage seems like a bad decision
[3:45:56] <+RealThiele> with prisoners that bypass block tho
[3:45:58] <Louie_Salmon> That's a nice illustration of what you would pay 2 health for. 1 mana and keeping block is strong
[3:46:01] <dukenux> Big block for big boys
[3:46:10] <%Namillus> Because if not that's 1 momentum 20 block that sticks around
[3:46:14] <Louie_Salmon> The prison levels are some of the best in the game
[3:46:14] <+glgzephyr> ooh I really like that transition from stage selection to combat
[3:46:17] <striderzer0> block buffs are per level?
[3:46:17] <Asuterisuku> Lots of rails to toss people off.
[3:46:19] <@Menitta> tight open space
[3:46:20] <+YharnamNighthawk> Wait, is this just Metal Gear Acid?
[3:46:26] <%TheBensonator_> s p a c e
[3:46:32] <Grunkle_Dan_> it made me think of metal gear acid too LUL
[3:46:34] <Hammatime8> A whole lot of railings, too!
[3:46:35] <Louie_Salmon> @YharnamNighthawk I never drew the connection but wow yeah
[3:46:44] <WG101> bye
[3:46:44] <naoi0> DED
[3:46:49] <+RealThiele> rip
[3:46:51] <Hammatime8> Yeet that boy!
[3:46:53] <%TheBensonator_> oh boy
[3:47:09] <WG101> UH OH
[3:47:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:47:10] <+RyTYoung> uh oh
[3:47:11] <dukenux> TANK
[3:47:16] <%TheBensonator_> !MOTIVATED
[3:47:16] <@Moobot> 2134 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:47:17] <Grunkle_Dan_> welp
[3:47:18] <+Flatopia> This game how it feel when you rent a single player game and your siblings think it look cool
[3:47:21] <UrsusDerpus> That’s why all the displacement moves are so good
[3:47:34] <Hammatime8> These prison boys know how to armor up!
[3:47:36] <%TheBensonator_> B I G B A N G
[3:47:46] <MasterTonberry23> my headcanon is there is a riot in progress right now
[3:47:51] <+askalta> i wanna show this game to one of my brothers now
[3:47:56] <+yusefHD> splayed out jesus lmfao
[3:47:58] <+glgzephyr> bro his neck angle
[3:47:59] <+RealThiele> d e d'
[3:48:01] <UrsusDerpus> In this prison, there’s always a riot
[3:48:16] <+yusefHD> Yeah RIP
[3:48:23] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is spooky
[3:48:30] <dukenux> this looks bad
[3:48:30] <Grunkle_Dan_> oh no
[3:48:39] <+Flatopia> oh this ain't a fun spot
[3:48:40] <Onamar> Swap kick block
[3:48:41] <Louie_Salmon> Not taking damage at least
[3:48:41] <deadbrainpl> You can move up and stun him hopefully
[3:48:47] <%rottingpastry> fukt
[3:48:51] <+yusefHD> somebody's gettin fuuuuu-
[3:48:57] <Louie_Salmon> Oh right swap can OS into just a movement card
[3:48:59] <Adwark> Is shotgun range only 2 fields?
[3:49:06] <UrsusDerpus> Put on some block reduce damage
[3:49:06] <naoi0> Make the best out of a bad situation
[3:49:06] <+glgzephyr> swap and kill seems most efficient, no?
[3:49:07] <+RealThiele> block gun with fists
[3:49:08] <MasterTonberry23> gonna have to tank a shot like kiryu
[3:49:10] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> they do shit damage anyway so it's ok
[3:49:17] <deadbrainpl> @Adwark Nope, full range - this ain't FPS range :)
[3:49:26] <UrsusDerpus> @adwark no it’s full screen
[3:49:34] <pi_in_the_sci> kill and move back one
[3:49:44] <UrsusDerpus> All guns have full range
[3:49:45] <deadbrainpl> Move up, hit and Throat Punch him
[3:49:55] <+RealThiele> gun range yeah
[3:50:01] <%BinaryFireball> punch bullet
[3:50:04] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> right move
[3:50:17] <UrsusDerpus> He has no movement
[3:50:19] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's good
[3:50:21] <+yusefHD> PogChamp
[3:50:24] <Grunkle_Dan_> big brain, holy shit
[3:50:25] <UrsusDerpus> Yeah that’ll work
[3:50:28] <+yusefHD> He's beginning to believe.
[3:50:50] <deadbrainpl> Dash, slip, left spin the back guy to hit the first one

[3:50:50] <%ChoculaUltra> you guys remember that one scene in the Sherlock movies where he breaks down the fight with Moriarty before it actually ever happens? This game feels like that.
[3:50:55] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> combo counter cards not costing momentum is such a good move
[3:50:57] <+glgzephyr> I love deck building games like this. There's so much unexplored design space in the genre
[3:51:06] <WG101> @ChoculaUltra discombobulate
[3:51:08] <+RealThiele> left kick back guard to have him shoot his friend maybe
[3:51:09] <MasterTonberry23> @ChoculaUltra i memba!
[3:51:09] <dukenux> Discombobulate
[3:51:16] <+yusefHD> Discombobulate
[3:51:21] <%rottingpastry> dash eat combo
[3:51:22] <Onamar> Slip around you're fine
[3:51:24] <UrsusDerpus> It’s like the Raid but slower
[3:51:26] <+glgzephyr> Discombobulate
[3:51:31] <+Flatopia> wait no just slip around hims
[3:51:35] <deadbrainpl> Slip gives you combo though
[3:51:37] <pi_in_the_sci> slip past
[3:51:38] <+RealThiele> b o n k
[3:51:48] <dukenux> Distract him, quick punch in the ribs and... discombobulate
[3:51:53] <UrsusDerpus> But he’s gonna slip into another gun
[3:51:56] <%rottingpastry> left spin kick will knock the other dude over
[3:52:01] <Louie_Salmon> @glgzephyr The faeria guys are making one on their hex grid and with two characters, seemed cool a year ago
[3:52:02] <deadbrainpl> Yeah but then he can kick him
[3:52:03] <+Flatopia> oh my b I thought slip could get behind
[3:52:04] <+RealThiele> hes out of movement
[3:52:22] <+glgzephyr> why would he approach when he has gun LUL
[3:52:33] <+hoenhime344> woolie has 2 buck shot in him right now
[3:52:33] <UrsusDerpus> Shift can pass behind, but I don’t think he has that
[3:52:34] <+glgzephyr> @Louie_Salmon What's it called
[3:52:49] <Adwark> @glgzephyr Approach to get into position from which he can shoot
[3:53:17] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> the game tells you. the damage has to be enough to kill the block tho
[3:53:35] <Hammatime8> And he doesn't get armor back when he's stunned!
[3:53:48] <UrsusDerpus> Yeah, stun always works, but you just have to chip off the armor first
[3:53:58] <Onamar> Shove
[3:54:00] <%rottingpastry> step shove?
[3:54:03] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> stun and downed are so useful
[3:54:08] <TurtleButter> and no 5 combo oof
[3:54:08] <Grunkle_Dan_> nice!
[3:54:17] <deadbrainpl> There he goes :)
[3:54:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:54:18] <+yusefHD> The replays are so sick
[3:54:39] <UrsusDerpus> There are some unthrowable dudes, but I don’t think there are any unstunnable guys
[3:54:53] <+glgzephyr> wow they really went all in on the Superhot influence, complete with replays
[3:54:54] <WG101> YOOOOOO
[3:54:59] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> super good
[3:55:01] <UrsusDerpus> I know there’s an unpushable guy
[3:55:11] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> @UrsusDerpus yeah but he's unique
[3:55:20] <UrsusDerpus> Which is good
[3:55:32] <UrsusDerpus> Pushing is so good
[3:55:35] <+askalta> 3 seems better tbh
[3:55:36] <+glgzephyr> rising strength seems good
[3:55:45] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> 3 costs your entire turn tho
[3:55:47] <%rottingpastry> I bet upgrade makes it cost 2
[3:55:50] <+RealThiele> losing a turn to buff
[3:55:54] <UrsusDerpus> It is good, but it’s high cost
[3:56:02] <+RealThiele> although snap strike can drop it to 2
[3:56:24] <0m1k3l> Decks seems to be getting pretty big
[3:56:47] <UrsusDerpus> The deck gets real fat
[3:56:57] <+glgzephyr> the floor outside the cell is lava?
[3:57:05] <UrsusDerpus> Yes
[3:57:06] <%rottingpastry> guy opens the scenario aiming at his buddy. good plan
[3:57:08] <Onamar> Swap is move 1
[3:57:12] <pi_in_the_sci> you can move a bit with swap
[3:57:19] <+kurosaru96> swap moves 1, and leleft spin kick the gunner?
[3:57:42] <MasterTonberry23> @rottingpastry "i never liked this guy, nows my chance!"
[3:58:07] <%rottingpastry> it looks like you can redraw after you play some cards
[3:58:40] <COMB711> You can kill that dude
[3:58:59] <COMB711> nvm nvm
[3:59:30] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> vault is maybe the most useful on this map
[4:00:17] <Hammatime8> Snap strike boosts damage for the turn, too
[4:00:38] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> nah it will
[4:00:41] <Onamar> They only have 8 armor and it has 9 damage it will work
[4:00:57] <%rottingpastry> I mean it does damage regardless, right?
[4:00:59] <Hammatime8> Nah, they don't have enough block to negate the dart
[4:01:13] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> stun works if you deplete all their armor with the damage
[4:01:32] <pi_in_the_sci> slip shove, rising
[4:01:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:02:10] <+askalta> heart of the cards
[4:02:50] <Grunkle_Dan_> this game needs some DMC music
[4:03:02] <%WutangchickeN> wutang6AHAHA
[4:03:30] <%rottingpastry> welp
[4:03:55] <Hammatime8> That damage boost from rising strength is making pushes and shoves deal damage, too!
[4:03:57] <+askalta> discombobulate
[4:04:00] <pi_in_the_sci> combo counter instead
[4:04:15] <%rottingpastry> pushes into stuff do damage anyway?
[4:04:36] <deadbrainpl> @rottingpastry Yep, 4 damage - there are cards that increase it too
[4:04:44] <WG101> "thank you sir, may i have another?"
[4:05:19] <VincentGraves> should do an xcom playthrough
[4:05:25] <2deep5u> that looked like a cross counter
[4:05:27] <penitentpendant> I like that as a suggestion, make a "Sherlock Holmes" game like that
[4:05:47] <Hammatime8> Fantastic game to play while listening to a podcast or whatever
[4:05:53] <%nintega010> @woolieversus you don't like xcom? cause I would love that playthrough especially if you name your charactersbafter peopls you know
[4:05:54] <pi_in_the_sci> heal seems pretty dope
[4:05:57] <+askalta> is hoof kick a real thing?
[4:06:04] <WG101> hook kick? yeah
[4:06:12] <%Namillus> XCOM is very not perfect information
[4:06:45] <+b_aleph> Xcom is as far from perfect information as it gets
[4:07:02] <%nintega010> @namillus i can ses that. even xcom 2? could he like play it on easy
[4:07:03] <penitentpendant> XCOM where 95% = 0%
[4:07:03] <+ja07sj> SBFP did an XCOM 2 playthrough... it... did not go well...
[4:07:25] <COMB711> Pat described it as "cascading failure"
[4:07:29] <%Namillus> Look jetpacks were on the table
[4:07:45] <WG101> and an alien looked like kamen rider, so...
[4:07:58] <@Solidus_113> The Xcom LP was legendary
[4:07:58] <Adwark> @COMB711 Oh that's very true, when you start losing your resources to perform actions... oof it does cascade indeed
[4:08:20] <feralspidey> I've had an idea for a game's combat system where it's standard third person character action, but you have a Dead Eye style "Tactical Mode" where you slow time, target enemies with specific moves to exploit their weak points and even see what their next move will do.
[4:08:21] <pi_in_the_sci> vault over him?
[4:08:24] <WG101> "I tried so hard, guys..." -Pat, in utter defeat
[4:08:24] <Onamar> There's no gap behind you
[4:08:40] <+SammyOVision> There's a wall behind you
[4:08:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[4:08:48] <Hammatime8> Nah, getting shot won't throw you off
[4:08:56] <Hammatime8> Not right now, at least
[4:08:57] <pi_in_the_sci> snap first?
[4:09:27] <%nintega010> oh well. Maybe an easier xcom game will come soon. Cause I would like to see them name a character reggie and if he dies were all sad, but remember his accomplishments
[4:09:32] <+Exicuren> bonk
[4:09:33] <Hammatime8> Oooo, can't ignore that auto-attack
[4:10:47] <pi_in_the_sci> swap still let's you move one in any direction
[4:11:07] <Hammatime8> Briefcase objectives aren't easy for counter deck, I've found
[4:11:51] <deadbrainpl> Head Smash ends combo though
[4:11:52] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> headsmash ends your combo
[4:11:55] <deadbrainpl> So it'll reset you to 0
[4:11:58] <Adwark> That Head Smash doesn't end the combo tho?
[4:12:35] <Hammatime8> @Adwark It does
[4:13:19] <mortalmanbaby> having a hard time knowing when the gun guys attack
[4:13:48] <Hammatime8> @mortalmanbaby If you hover over an enemy, it tells you what their turn order is
[4:13:59] <deadbrainpl> @mortalmanbaby There are numbers next to their damage (the red bar) that show their turn order
[4:14:17] <deadbrainpl> So now it's nighstick->Shotgun->Shotgun
[4:15:14] <feralspidey> dash, though
[4:15:30] <SixthShinx> smrt ai
[4:15:51] <Hammatime8> Auto-attack doesn't activate during attack phase, I guess?

[4:21:28] <%Namillus> @mortalmanbaby If gun guys have an unobstructed line on you at the start of the turn they'll shoot when their action comes up.
[4:21:47] <mortalmanbaby> @Namillus gotcha
[4:22:10] <%Namillus> UNLESS you aren't in their line of fire any more in which case they'll move, but if you move someone else into line of fire they'll still shoot
[4:22:29] <pi_in_the_sci> i'm feeling traincars
[4:22:43] <penitentpendant> A hotel bathroom, environmental hazard: Wet Tile

[4:23:05] <Louie_Salmon> Literally haven't seen that card
[4:23:15] <Louie_Salmon> Played this game for 25 hours and haven't seen that
[4:23:18] <+b_aleph> Daimon his ass
[4:23:29] <Louie_Salmon> There's so many cards in this game
[4:24:02] <+b_aleph> Can you grab them out of the floor and throw them again?
[4:24:53] <Hammatime8> @b_aleph Only certain cards can hit downed enemies, unfortunately
[4:25:32] <+b_aleph> his name jeff
[4:25:36] <+Exicuren> 3 times, damn
[4:27:46] <deadbrainpl> Separate the Chef to hit the stunned dude would be good
[4:27:50] <deadbrainpl> Ah shit
[4:27:54] <deadbrainpl> I forgot he turns, my bad
[4:28:32] <huskarl_zap> CHEF IS FED
[4:28:38] <%saladin1911> Oh what, is this game straight up not coming to PS4/5?
[4:28:53] <striderzer0> oh no tops fed
[4:29:04] <Hammatime8> Always snap strike first the damage boost

[4:31:19] <deadbrainpl> 2FAT4THROW
[4:31:29] <pi_in_the_sci> roll throw the gunner just to simplify?
[4:31:34] <penitentpendant> Enemy Buff: American Weight Class
[4:31:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> heavies can't be ringed out?
[4:31:37] <%Euphbugg> FAT is power
[4:31:40] <tattleworm> a lot of the harder bosses are heavy so i just ignore knockdown cards at this point
[4:31:55] <Hammatime8> A grappler's weakness is his opponent's morbid obesity Kappa
[4:32:09] <pi_in_the_sci> swap rising strength?
[4:32:24] <tattleworm> swap with chef, counter + power sink
[4:32:57] <Hammatime8> That works too
[4:33:02] <Adwark> oof.
[4:33:09] <+b_aleph> oof
[4:33:12] <WG101> that's a lot of damage
[4:33:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oof
[4:33:14] <deadbrainpl> And the dude trying to get up under you damages you too
[4:33:16] <%Euphbugg> oof
[4:33:17] <+glgzephyr> ONE mistake
[4:33:20] <Hammatime8> Oooo, never mind
[4:33:21] <+RealThiele> critical condition
[4:33:22] <Louie_Salmon> That's how it goes sometimes.
[4:33:23] <+glgzephyr> no forgiveness
[4:33:24] <tattleworm> i have learned not to do that by making the exact same mistake
[4:33:42] <+PlushMines> Yeah this room is so punishing
[4:33:44] <Hammatime8> That was some nasty damage from one turn
[4:33:51] <+PlushMines> @tattleworm same
[4:36:43] <+RealThiele> brutal
[4:37:17] <+glgzephyr> wait I looked away for two seconds and the chef is gone. Did he kick him out the door?
[4:37:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[4:37:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @glgzephyr smashed his head on the table
[4:37:32] <Idon__> head smashed the chef
[4:37:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy fuck
[4:37:51] <Hammatime8> Nothing to do but run. You hate to see it :/
[4:38:01] <tattleworm> push jump kick, out the door
[4:38:07] <Johannen> Deck synergy seems very poor for a type of game they are trying to make
[4:38:13] <+glgzephyr> push then kick?
[4:38:59] <+glgzephyr> are there different deck types you can roll?
[4:39:15] <tattleworm> 4 different starter decks, then you customise in game from there
[4:39:22] <tattleworm> roadmap said they're gonna do custom starter decks too
[4:39:48] <Louie_Salmon> Lots of decisions for them to make about balance, excited to see what they do
[4:40:02] <WG101> DESTROY THIS MAN
[4:40:12] <Hammatime8> INFINITE COUNTER WORKS
[4:40:28] <tattleworm> this fight in particular is really hard to get the "clear in x turns" objective for some reason
[4:40:32] <Asuterisuku> Oof, dropped frames.
[4:40:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh ok not just me then
[4:40:45] <+EternalInquisitor> My fraaaaaaaaaaaames
[4:40:46] <Asuterisuku> I hope that's just on my en - oh.
[4:40:48] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> COUNTER THE FRAMES
[4:40:49] <+RealThiele> animation go br...r..r
[4:40:50] <Johannen> fraaaaames
[4:40:51] <+glgzephyr> @WoolieVersus Stream is shitting itself
[4:41:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's the stream not the game
[4:41:09] <Enyoyable> And we're back
[4:41:09] <+glgzephyr> we're good now
[4:41:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ay we back
[4:41:13] <Asuterisuku> Looks like it's recovered.
[4:41:17] <Louie_Salmon> The tables and all the shooters are very tricky
[4:41:25] <tattleworm> chef ate that table
[4:41:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck that head smash looks brutal
[4:41:49] <hassanico2> Man the prison goes on for a while huh?
[4:42:09] <Johannen> Can you discard cards?
[4:42:13] <+glgzephyr> free damage!
[4:42:14] <Hammatime8> @cobalt_phoenix_ I'll never get over watching enemies go limp when head smash is lethal
[4:42:35] <hassanico2> 3/4 odds isn't bad
[4:42:42] <+RealThiele> greed play
[4:42:44] <+kurosaru96> A fight can also lead to more healing
[4:43:04] <MasterTonberry23> 75% is not 100%
[4:43:13] <tattleworm> that one had early mafia, pretty sure
[4:43:18] <Hammatime8> Or just get 50 bucks :)
[4:43:24] <%Euphbugg> LUL
[4:43:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok but is that real 75% or xcom 75%
[4:43:28] <hassanico2> I remember when the prison scenario had a "Your plane is crashing" event, they're really silly LUL
[4:43:29] <+RealThiele> oof this room
[4:43:43] <MasterTonberry23> not in xcom!
[4:43:43] <2deep5u> what is a chef doing in the cell? was he an inmate there?
[4:43:45] <+allups> aesy woolie
[4:43:49] <+coachacpatterson> What’s up everyone
[4:43:55] <hassanico2> oooh, interesting escort
[4:43:57] <+allups> easy*
[4:44:08] <Rosewater_444> phrasing
[4:44:16] <striderzer0> would roll throw and stand on them work too?
[4:44:44] <tattleworm> standing on an enemy means you take like 5 damage every turn so kinda but probably unwise
[4:44:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:44:45] <Hammatime8> Also, there's another freaking chef
[4:45:05] <+b_aleph> WHat are those drawings on the ground? amogus?
[4:45:21] <+glgzephyr> @2deep5u Chef just wonders the halls of the prison like the mind flayers in Latria
[4:45:25] <+kurosaru96> will you take damage from the swap?
[4:45:31] <+zaworldo> @WoolieVersus dont forget to utilize that redraw man
[4:45:51] <deadbrainpl> Counter first, he'll auto-attack you
[4:45:57] <2deep5u> @glgzephyr lmao
[4:46:54] <deadbrainpl> Standing on top of dudes hurts you though
[4:47:14] <+glgzephyr> snap strike first, right?
[4:47:39] <+glgzephyr> Blow up the healer
[4:47:45] <deadbrainpl> I died so many times in this room trying to set up that WallPunch
[4:49:01] <+glgzephyr> strike first then move
[4:49:05] <+glgzephyr> right?
[4:49:17] <lyriuswolf> The counter deck is pretty broken
[4:49:20] <+kurosaru96> does blocking trigger their attaccks?
[4:49:26] <pi_in_the_sci> long counter then use the rest after
[4:49:48] <echobee_tv> !MOTIVATED
[4:49:48] <@Moobot> 2136 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:50:57] <lyriuswolf> Long counter + block would've nulled damage and dealt it back to both enemies
[4:51:28] <+glgzephyr> he wants to protect the informant

[4:54:19] <lyriuswolf> Counter stun!
[4:54:29] <+glgzephyr> "Hopefully RNG is on your side" is not really the kind of sentence I want to hear when playing this sort of game
[4:55:05] <Adwark> @glgzephyr That's something that refers to like literally any card game available

[4:57:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "nooooo pwease don't corner meeee" then hit em with the kick
[4:57:55] <deadbrainpl> He got Shove on that turn too, blessed draw
[4:58:32] <tattleworm> woolie's 29 card deck pulls exactly what he needs while my 12 card deck leaves me hanging
[4:58:45] <+glgzephyr> Kimahri would love this game LUL
[4:58:53] <pi_in_the_sci> just push and heal
[4:58:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:59:25] <Hammatime8> Head smash will do more damage from the combo that gets bigger from the swap and push
[4:59:29] <+glgzephyr> but it will push him
[5:00:06] <Hammatime8> Y'know what? Yeah, that heal will come in handy later
[5:00:33] <+glgzephyr> "stun" dart
[5:00:56] <nelsonsaysbooya> Heal card comes back each fight
[5:01:31] <+glgzephyr> double jump kick!
[5:02:10] <therakishsage> Now imagine if the people making this game had the budget for mocap.
[5:02:14] <Wispy_231> @WoolieVersus dont wanna backseat, but so far in my games event can give good shit
[5:02:22] <Jaysky> Vent? Sus.
[5:02:26] <+glgzephyr> he's doing event anyways
[5:02:27] <Wispy_231> wait thats a spoiler, sorry ill shh
[5:02:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now that's a tight space
[5:02:37] <tattleworm> oh you can do some neat stuff with seperate here
[5:02:41] <WG101> the jesus sandwich maneuver
[5:02:48] <deadbrainpl> Might need a redraw here
[5:03:06] <Wispy_231> this game is the john wick game but actualy good LUL
[5:03:36] <Louie_Salmon> I still gotta try that thing
[5:03:53] <nelsonsaysbooya> Have fun with this one woolz
[5:03:53] <Wispy_231> @Louie_Salmon john wick game? dont get ya hopes up
[5:04:02] <tattleworm> redraw won't guarantee you a move card so maybe move first
[5:04:02] <+glgzephyr> take what you want, then use redraw
[5:04:08] <Louie_Salmon> @wispy_231 Never heard anyone talk about it, but it HAS to be cool, right?
[5:04:29] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> I thought this was NHL 98 for a second
[5:04:31] <Wispy_231> @Louie_Salmon buy it on a sale when its cheeper
[5:04:32] <+glgzephyr> it absolutely does not have to be cool
[5:04:40] <Wispy_231> not worth the full payment imo
[5:04:46] <Louie_Salmon> Hm fair enough
[5:06:00] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Pretty disappointed with it limmyFlexL limmyFedUp limmyFlexR
[5:06:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[5:06:18] <CrmznOgre> Yo I just jumped on, but this looks interesting as hell
[5:06:47] <tattleworm> order up!
[5:06:51] <+glgzephyr> I'm gonna pick this up after it leaves early access. Sounds like it'll be a much different game in a year
[5:06:55] <MasterTonberry23> enemy reinforcements have arrived
[5:07:02] <Onamar> Counter first
[5:07:02] <CrmznOgre> This is gonna end up like that Cap in the elevator fight
[5:07:03] <+waltzqueen> this is gonna be a rough one folks
[5:07:06] <deadbrainpl> That front kick is tempting but the auto-attack
[5:07:13] <nelsonsaysbooya> get smacked
[5:07:23] <CrmznOgre> go to horny jail
[5:07:27] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> So is this basically The Raid TCG?
[5:08:10] <MasterTonberry23> not looking good for our hero
[5:08:36] <nelsonsaysbooya> Kinda. It's Going Into the SuperHot Breach to Slay the Spire
[5:08:40] <+glgzephyr> just murder him
[5:08:45] <tattleworm> shotgun's gonna knock you back if you try to block i think
[5:08:58] <Wispy_231> its slay the spire for people who like action movies, and its awesome
[5:09:20] <MasterTonberry23> wait its only in early access? aw i thought this was full release :D
[5:09:38] <Wispy_231> @MasterTonberry23 very well done early access
[5:10:04] <Wispy_231> if it was a AAA game it would be already out LUL
[5:10:57] <pi_in_the_sci> vault in front of chef and shove him
[5:11:07] <WG101> what about shoving the chef to the shotgunner?
[5:11:14] <pi_in_the_sci> vault to side
[5:11:38] <pi_in_the_sci> vault to side, shove shef, heal
[5:13:28] <tattleworm> nothing else on this turn yeah
[5:13:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:13:51] <%AyotoCorp> You can shove bosses out of the level right?
[5:14:03] <Wispy_231> @AyotoCorp you can shove anyone
[5:14:06] <tattleworm> it's probably the best way of dealing with them!
[5:14:07] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[5:14:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 21 minutes
[5:14:16] <Wispy_231> @AyotoCorp allso chef is not technically a boss
[5:14:24] <Wispy_231> @AyotoCorp just a dam hard enemy
[5:14:31] <%Seancicle> gonna jet. c u l8tr o7
[5:14:32] <DedlokPM> @AyotoCorp yeah once they are by the railings on this level (or open doors)
[5:14:42] <%AyotoCorp> Oh, I think the chef was the boss of the demo
[5:14:50] <Wispy_231> @AyotoCorp gotcha
[5:16:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[5:16:29] <Hammatime8> Fuck that guy AND his stupid apron
[5:16:35] <+NewAndTastySixthHouse> Woolie's not used to doing it with a chef
[5:16:37] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> "I've done this many dudes" Woolie 2021
[5:16:39] <+NewAndTastySixthHouse> That's a whole new ballgame
[5:16:49] <doc_ock_rokc> woolieFABRICATION
[5:17:20] <+MikeNmurdoc> i'm excited to see this game grow. these replays could be really special
[5:17:21] <PMda2nd> all these guns, and a chef!?!?!
[5:17:39] <+MikeNmurdoc> @pmda2126 gunmen gotta eat too
[5:17:40] <Wispy_231> @pmda2126 the guns are all riot guns apparently
[5:17:53] <Wispy_231> stolen from the guards oddoneHmm
[5:18:22] <Wispy_231> save the homie
[5:18:27] <+KingLlama1> wait ... is this a better Metal Gear Acid ?
[5:18:45] <WG101> THAT IS A LOT
[5:18:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit
[5:18:47] <JdotSweapA> what wrong Dillan? thisis203Curlypoke
[5:18:50] <BlackermanZX> dats a lot
[5:19:09] <pi_in_the_sci> head smash?
[5:19:16] <Wispy_231> what does the heal do?
[5:19:28] <BlackermanZX> heal StinkyGlitch
[5:19:39] <Wispy_231> oh, wish it made it cheeper
[5:19:39] <%Namillus> That's a fat heal
[5:20:08] <Wispy_231> take the glass cannon mindset... you dont need to heal if you can kill everything before then HahaThink
[5:20:11] <pi_in_the_sci> is quick strike free when upgraded?
[5:20:23] <MasterTonberry23> healing can save you when rngesus does not smile tho
[5:20:45] <+glgzephyr> yeah that's very poor
[5:20:46] <%Namillus> yeah 50 for 5 feels better
[5:20:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:20:49] <+glgzephyr> makes no difference
[5:21:14] <MasterTonberry23> let me put some boss music on
[5:23:18] <Hammatime8> I've been DESTROYED by forgetting about the prison boss's auto attack

[5:23:36] <pi_in_the_sci> you can move a lot this turn
[5:24:00] <Onamar> Boss is gonna attack
[5:24:05] <tattleworm> if he turns to face you when you move upwards, shoving him in front of the shiv means they'll hit each other
[5:24:07] <pi_in_the_sci> counter first
[5:24:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MEATY
[5:24:41] <mantraman97> Shove the shiv in the shower, shamuel.
[5:25:26] <+kknutson4> I'm just here to hype SLAY THE SPIRE
[5:25:26] <pi_in_the_sci> quick block, counter stun
[5:25:38] <+glgzephyr> block it all then counter stun
[5:25:44] <tattleworm> it's worth it for the stun, yeah
[5:25:45] <+glgzephyr> Big Block
[5:25:46] <nelsonsaysbooya> put up block before doing anything
[5:26:19] <+glgzephyr> does Woolie not look at all the cards in hand before planning?
[5:26:56] <tattleworm> it's easy to overlook the obvious sometimes
[5:27:26] <+glgzephyr> I guess he is relatively new to the genre
[5:27:30] <pi_in_the_sci> swap with stun boy, your clean
[5:27:36] <Onamar> Roll throw then push?
[5:28:25] <MasterTonberry23> you should get the headbutt card for beating that guy. just sayin...
[5:28:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:29:31] <pi_in_the_sci> get that rising going
[5:29:44] <+glgzephyr> this is the last encounter isn't it? Doesn't he just have to clear this fight with more than 0 HP to win?
[5:30:06] <pi_in_the_sci> can you stun the boss?
[5:30:19] <Onamar> Power sink
[5:30:27] <pi_in_the_sci> with power sink you can tank it
[5:31:24] <pi_in_the_sci> seperate
[5:31:33] <tattleworm> seperate, front kick, out the door
[5:31:42] <nelsonsaysbooya> he is beginning to believe
[5:31:45] <Hammatime8> Yeeeah, get that seperate going!
[5:31:51] <shinichizio> "Leave"
[5:32:02] <+glgzephyr> go for swap LUL
[5:32:12] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:32:15] <BlackermanZX> thats really risky monkaS
[5:32:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[5:32:28] <%zacyzacy> wow this is my first time seeing this game it really is stylish
[5:32:36] <+glgzephyr> it's not THAT risky since they can't hit you this turn
[5:33:26] <tattleworm> you won't be getting swap again for at least another 5 hands
[5:34:42] <+glgzephyr> dash to the corner?
[5:34:42] <SA0RLA> Woolie is a cool guy
[5:35:34] <Meltgar> Just arrived to stream, so, it's a card builder game?
[5:35:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[5:35:42] <Meltgar> *Deck
[5:35:47] <+glgzephyr> bad turn
[5:35:54] <%zacyzacy> zacyzacy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Have you seen that card game with the Blazblue characters? it's weirdly a lot like this.
[5:36:02] <pi_in_the_sci> didn't lose anything
[5:36:08] <Hammatime8> We're not getting the cards we need. The deck might be starting to get bloated
[5:36:26] <Onamar> Counter first
[5:36:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ayyyy
[5:36:54] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Did they start by playing Adios?
[5:37:01] <+glgzephyr> PREY SLAUGHTERED
[5:37:03] <@Solidus_113> yes
[5:37:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @sullivansbizarreadventure yea
[5:37:12] <sullivansbizarreadventure> LuvHearts
[5:37:19] <tattleworm> i still think the counter deck is weak but the replays look way cooler than aggressive, i'll give it that
[5:38:25] <+glgzephyr> that replay bug is pretty consistent
[5:38:36] <+glgzephyr> like-mided LUL
[5:38:46] <MasterTonberry23> wooo that was great!
[5:39:08] <Hammatime8> We're keeping the third chapter secret, are we? Good call
[5:39:18] <Louie_Salmon> All the areas are long because of the tactical combat, tons of decision-making
[5:39:20] <+glgzephyr> that seems grueling
[5:39:28] <Hammatime8> That was awesome, this game is awesome
[5:39:29] <+glgzephyr> you can save in the middle of a run, right?
[5:39:31] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:39:36] <%zacyzacy> LUL
[5:39:41] <+NewAndTastySixthHouse> Fights in Sexy Spaces
[5:39:44] <%holydeviant1> and hey, Pat's about to start!
[5:39:44] <Louie_Salmon> That's the wresting outfit sim coming out soon
[5:40:08] <Hammatime8> @glgzephyr Yep! Heck, you can save in the middle of a turn!
[5:40:27] <+glgzephyr> goods
[5:40:35] <Louie_Salmon> About the raddest combo I could hope for
[5:40:46] <Wispy_231> we face the weebs next!
[5:41:13] <Hammatime8> If y'all aren't sold on this yet: There IS a suplex card.
[5:41:43] <Meltgar> Where's the lariat card
[5:41:46] <tattleworm> you can suplex people out of rooms even
[5:41:48] <Ultra_Pancake> I peeped a Baz 👀
