[0:02:23] <alrobot2014> oh shoot the game awards exist
[0:02:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYYEYEYEYEYYEYEEY
[0:02:26] <%Weeewer> LUL
[0:02:29] <@akuda_bar> it is... a bit...
[0:02:30] <+cvp5127> LUL
[0:02:30] <+paladinstarbuster> IT IS
[0:02:32] <SomersaultJustice> it is, but do it anyway
[0:02:38] <MyNameIsRasus> It is but do it
[0:02:40] <%Weeewer> a little dumb, but pretty funny
[0:02:40] <alrobot2014> could play while watching
[0:02:42] <Harro8> Watch it
[0:02:44] <+cvp5127> you do you
[0:02:44] <OblivionSword1> nah just play WAKU WAKU
[0:02:49] <DatAsuna> Honestly if you don't watch it, I'll be watching paige, sorry but true
[0:02:54] <@SoushinSen> we need reggie's enthusiasm for VGA
[0:02:54] <CaptainBright> well, I think a majority of us will be on Paige and Pat's stream, whilst you guys are playing
[0:02:57] <SomersaultJustice> put TGA in a picture-in-picture and play waku waku
[0:02:59] <pjbuster> after the smash character reveal I'm dipping the game awards
[0:03:01] <Harro8> I'll watch you watch it
[0:03:02] <+vaderxyz1970> Waku Waku has a bigger cultural impact than the game awards
[0:03:03] <GeltonZ> Why not DO BOTH! Watch Game Awards and play Waku Waku 7 at the same time!
[0:03:04] <watchdv> Do game awards then waki
[0:03:06] <%gatorafan> I don't mind, but I might be on the minority
[0:03:09] <Blank9> enthusiastic reggie would make me watch vga's
[0:03:10] <+paladinstarbuster> I NEED MY REGGIE POGS
[0:03:12] <%fairore> @pjbuster lol LUL
[0:03:14] <CaptainBright> it starts at uhh
[0:03:15] <%SideChar> yeah we need to see Reggie's Pure reactions
[0:03:15] <alrobot2014> nope
[0:03:15] <zekana> 6:30 eastern
[0:03:15] <+ZoltanBMagnus> 6:30
[0:03:17] <irfan_> hey its on brand woolie content
[0:03:17] <%RyTYoung> 7?
[0:03:23] <+cvp5127> 6:30 is pre show
[0:03:25] <CaptainBright> 1830 hours
[0:03:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> 7PM
[0:03:26] <+snugglepuggs> triple splitscreen it! waku waku, game awards, and you guys
[0:03:27] <DatAsuna> 6:30 is preshow,
[0:03:28] <au_d3n> Chat, try not to get a seizure
[0:03:30] <DatAsuna> Nier stuff is in preshow
[0:03:44] <BanquoViaquo> I'm sure plenty of people would be delighted to hear you guys' commentary on the show (to say nothing of the smash reveal!)
[0:03:45] <+MetroidPrimeRib> the preshow will have shit in it
[0:03:45] <@SoushinSen> hey maybe don't watch/stream VGA because of DMCA
[0:03:46] <+cvp5127> preshow has trailer
[0:03:47] <GeltonZ> (The number of people hyped for Waku Waku 7 here gives me life)
[0:03:48] <%jiggy_snipe> just cancel GIFG and catch up on your work
[0:03:56] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Preshow will still have some announcements and a persona musical performance I think
[0:03:58] <DatAsuna> All the cool shit gets pushed into preshow hell
[0:03:59] <alrobot2014> oh yeah minh makes a good point
[0:04:01] <%RyTYoung> muuuute
[0:04:06] <Harro8> then everyone gets hit
[0:04:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Paige is
[0:04:12] <+cvp5127> mass bans
[0:04:12] <%arancet> felons!
[0:04:32] <%Spydurman> call into Paige's stream and hang out with them?
[0:04:33] <SomersaultJustice> breaking the lawwwwww breaking the worrrllllddd
[0:04:36] <au_d3n> ^
[0:04:44] <Victory_Boss> Just stream yourself, and have a link to the actual stream in the title or something
[0:04:56] <DatAsuna> the other half step solution is just only stream your voice yeah and tell people to dual stream it
[0:05:09] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @WoolieVersus maybe stream it without audio and tell other people to open a different tab
[0:05:11] <%Weeewer> @Spydurman has he ever done that?
[0:05:14] <@SoushinSen> our Let's Watch of VGA last year got copyright claimed after all.
[0:05:15] <+JacknZack27> Didnt Paige decide to do it? What made her change her mind?
[0:05:26] <+cvp5127> she is
[0:05:30] <+CatastropheCorvid> Apparently working with a Dev to take down DURING a stream.
[0:05:36] <SomersaultJustice> see, picture in picture, then waku waku
[0:05:41] <SomersaultJustice> it's the best solution
[0:05:50] <CaptainBright> I swear, just wait for a political person like AOC to get DMCA'd, then you can see some development, maybe?
[0:05:51] <+MetroidPrimeRib> when you wield dmca as a hammer everything like a nail
[0:05:52] <%Spydurman> I think Paige is fine cause it ain't her career
[0:06:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @woolieversus Can you not delete the Vod right away?
[0:06:49] <CaptainBright> @BallerSwagBro9k the problem is, Twitch could be fucking us over with their streams being stored on their servers
[0:06:56] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> They've been hitting deleted clips and VODs since they aren't actually fully deleted right away
[0:06:57] <Victory_Boss> Shick hydrobot will break your kneecaps mid stream
[0:06:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Man 2020s been A year
[0:07:03] <CaptainBright> and the robots get to it first

[0:07:46] <MyNameIsRasus> FUCK THAT GUY
[0:07:48] <%jiggy_snipe> go to jail you dirty streamer
[0:07:48] <Mr_Strut> Is it more dick pics?
[0:07:51] <OblivionSword1> Man 2020 almost ended in a really shitty note
[0:07:53] <%jiggy_snipe> prison*
[0:08:02] <%velemi> That ghoul is my senator and I am so damn tired of him
[0:08:12] <BigManLugan> keep old people out of my technology
[0:08:15] <+cvp5127> must have gotten a nice big check
[0:08:20] <Garry_Guyface> Ayy fuck Ton
[0:08:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT
[0:08:25] <Garry_Guyface> tom*
[0:08:28] <@Menitta> There's no way that'll pass
[0:08:29] <pjbuster> That sounds crazy,
[0:08:30] <CaptainBright> I wonder of the EU courts will not give a shit about this DMCA fracas
[0:08:30] <+cvp5127> fucking boomers
[0:08:31] <+xerotwo> I hate it here
[0:08:32] <AnneSQF> thank god I'm not american
[0:08:32] <+MetroidPrimeRib> us senators are literal demons
[0:08:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
[0:08:37] <+Amaideus> Okay then Jack Thompson
[0:08:39] <+xerotwo> fuck the congress
[0:08:42] <brachydios777> THAT MAKES NO GOD DAMN SENSE
[0:08:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> In the US?
[0:08:43] <Argo247> That's crazy!
[0:08:46] <%velemi> It's being added into the Omnibus spending bill
[0:08:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1336233530779701249?s=20
[0:08:48] <+CatastropheCorvid> @WoolieVersus There have been previous instances of this being slipped into bills, and it's failed each time so far. It still has to pass several checks and approvals before being ratified.
[0:08:50] <Harro8> can we get the guy in jail for even suggesting that
[0:08:51] <Garry_Guyface> I'm suspecting this is some attempt at sniping AOC
[0:08:52] <+YaBish311> 100% this is because Republicans hate AOC and she streamed
[0:08:53] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a motherfucker that deserves to have his kneecaps shot out
[0:09:02] <+xerotwo> DAMN YOU BOOMERS!!!!!
[0:09:07] <Mr_Strut> That's correct
[0:09:10] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus If it helps he's trying to tie it onto our Covid relief package which is constantly dying and probably won't pass. But scary as fuck
[0:09:13] <+cvp5127> fuck the music industry

[0:09:15] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> im sorry american politics suck so much
[0:09:31] <brachydios777> American senators suck
[0:09:33] <pjbuster> I forgot about this scumbag
[0:09:35] <CaptainBright> man, everytime I think of a shitbag douche who hates videogames, it's always usually a bloody republican
[0:09:37] <alrobot2014> its a rider on the huge omnibus bill that has to pass so the government doesn't shut down, but hopefully that part gets struck out
[0:09:38] <@SoushinSen> Info to how to fight back that bill: https://old.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/ka0gis/a_provision_to_make_twitchyoutube_strikes_a/
[0:09:38] <%jiggy_snipe> it's tied to the ominus spending bill. they try stuff like this but they usually fail
[0:09:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> That will only affect the US right?
[0:09:42] <%Razputin217> Typical... quiettVaporfacepalm
[0:09:45] <+xerotwo> fuck this shit
[0:09:51] <theanora1> even worse, it's being earmarked onto a bill that HAS to pass
[0:10:00] <GeltonZ> @CaptainBright You need to expand your horizons then. Because HOOBOY...
[0:10:05] <+freeizone> corruption baybee
[0:10:06] <Victory_Boss> Copyright stuff passes borders based on international agreements
[0:10:06] <thesilverbard> Legal experts have given this a %4 chance of actually being passed
[0:10:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @victory_boss Jesus thats messed up
[0:10:29] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> @BallerSwagBro9k I would assume that if an artist is based in the us that the us will try to overreach because we've become a nation of bullies
[0:10:30] <au_d3n> :(
[0:10:36] <AnneSQF> guwutine has the hunggies for powiticians
[0:10:37] <brachydios777> Copyright fucking sucks
[0:10:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:10:46] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus it'd probably get struck down by courts for "stifling speech" but who knows who could get fucked over in the meantime if it passes
[0:10:46] <theanora1> yep
[0:10:49] <pjbuster> yea
[0:10:50] <alrobot2014> it sure does
[0:10:50] <%Spydurman> ya
[0:10:50] <%kyh9> Felons can't vote in the States, yep
[0:10:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[0:10:51] <@akuda_bar> can't vote, yeah
[0:10:53] <%kyh9> It's bullshit
[0:10:53] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Depends on the state
[0:10:54] <%ThisIsLloyd> yep
[0:10:54] <CaptainBright> or you could be like an asshat-not-republican like Joe Lieberman.....
[0:10:57] <%jiggy_snipe> depends on the state
[0:10:57] <theanora1> You cannot vote or own a gun
[0:11:00] <%Weeewer> !Streamer Rights In Danger!
[0:11:03] <Ned1292> yep it's stupid
[0:11:03] <Victory_Boss> Felons can also be made to do slave labor
[0:11:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOW
[0:11:06] <+snugglepuggs> depends from state to state
[0:11:11] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> No, thats not exactly true. It depends on the state I believe
[0:11:15] <%SjoeB89> That's insane
[0:11:17] <+cvp5127> its bad here
[0:11:21] <brachydios777> Yeah this guy needs to lose his job
[0:11:21] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> If felons can vote or not
[0:11:22] <%velemi> And this bastard just won his reelection
[0:11:23] <DatAsuna> Prison industrial complex and music lobbyists
[0:11:26] <au_d3n> That’s what you get for listening to Post Malone!!
[0:11:27] <%Spydurman> I hate this country . . .
[0:11:27] <theanora1> they are trying to pull back on the Felon's can't vote in multiple states
[0:11:32] <%ThisIsLloyd> there's a couple states being better and trying to get that not be a thing but most do
[0:11:35] <+snugglepuggs> you have to petition to court to be able to vote if you are a felon
[0:11:42] <Victory_Boss> Many prisons are for profit
[0:11:48] <Garry_Guyface> There should be a maximum age for voters
[0:11:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KAMALA 2?
[0:11:56] <linSP> Bruh trump got electrd
[0:12:01] <AnneSQF> yup
[0:12:01] <+CatastropheCorvid> @WoolieVersus There have been previous instances of this being slipped into bills, and it's failed each time so far. It still has to pass several checks and approvals before being ratified. The likelihood is super low.
[0:12:03] <+YaBish311> They choose their own electorates Woolie -gerrymandering
[0:12:06] <Nekros4442> The laws in the states are for corporations. This isnt new
[0:12:13] <CaptainBright> @BallerSwagBro9k no, it will just be Amped-up Kamala
[0:12:19] <ColbyBryant> It’s literally always been this bad
[0:12:23] <au_d3n> As soon as you turn on the camera you need to act like you have already committed a crime
[0:12:25] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> An example is China violating US copyright law. The US routinely goes after people in other countries.
[0:12:37] <BigManLugan> reminder that corporations have better rights than most normal people
[0:12:42] <brachydios777> Woolie would not be able to deal living in the States
[0:12:45] <theanora1> If it passes it will KILL youtube and Twitch
[0:13:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @brachydios777 does anyone except old white dudes?
[0:13:11] <au_d3n> 🤟
[0:13:25] <Mr_Strut> Why do we keep pretending children have value?
[0:13:27] <brachydios777> @ballerswagbro9k Fair enough
[0:13:40] <%bread_assassin> Happy Tree Friends would get fucked.
[0:13:52] <ColbyBryant> Nobody actually likes the constitution, they like the bill of rights which hasn’t been enforced for over 200 years
[0:14:06] <brachydios777> Internet law is fucked
[0:14:08] <CaptainBright> I still can't believe old, white Quebecers love to go to Florida in the winter months....
[0:14:10] <OblivionSword1> and he's a Vtuber now
[0:14:10] <Victory_Boss> But Disney needs to make money :)
[0:14:11] <%Livelinne> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:14:21] <au_d3n> :/
[0:14:43] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> I mean, lets not pretend like it's only US corps. Does no one remember Nintendo going after streamers and youtubers?
[0:15:02] <brachydios777> It’s frustrating
[0:15:17] <Mr_Strut> Wait another century, by then the boomers will be gone
[0:15:17] <CaptainBright> @TheNihilistEnthusiast that's a corporation; a DMCA bill by the GOVERNMENT is on a whole other level
[0:15:20] <au_d3n> Legit what can you do at this point?
[0:15:33] <au_d3n> Shut up and play the video game
[0:15:45] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> But its not a US based company. A lot of countries have copyright and some dont
[0:15:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Legit dystopic
[0:15:57] <brachydios777> @au_d3n His stream
[0:15:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:16:07] <+cvp5127> thank god ajit stepped down
[0:16:10] <DatAsuna> God i forgot about TTYD music
[0:16:10] <CaptainBright> @TheNihilistEnthusiast the problem is, all the services people use are based in the United States
[0:16:13] <+JingKaisean> Those poor corporations...
[0:16:26] <+JingKaisean> Won't someone please think about the shareholders?
[0:16:28] <brachydios777> @cvp5127 You mean ashit pie?
[0:16:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Eat all boomers
[0:16:35] <DatAsuna> And here i was just worried about jojo music being off limits for the comp lol
[0:16:46] <+cvp5127> @brachydios777 yes
[0:16:48] <DatAsuna> It just passed later with a less snappy name
[0:16:49] <Mr_Strut> Greed is eternal
[0:16:51] <OblivionSword1> Man living in the UUs must be fucking SUCKS
[0:16:58] <CaptainBright> HOOO BOOYYY Ajit Pai definitely screwed the pooch on the Amerikans
[0:17:02] <%Spydurman> it does suck here
[0:17:09] <CaptainBright> gg with your data caps
[0:17:12] <au_d3n> If you do too much with your stream, big companies hate you. If you don’t do too much and don’t have an energetic enough personality, normal people will have a harder time with that person
[0:17:14] <%Spydurman> I'm leaving if I can post-covid
[0:17:14] <brachydios777> Ajit pi is a shit
[0:17:23] <thesilverbard> It should be noted that the maximum penalty for multiple copyright infractions under this bill is $30,000
[0:17:24] <theanora1> the end goal is money, but screwing over all of your listener base will just make no one want to buy their stuff
[0:17:25] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus btw that dmca felony bill is being tacked onto a spending bill they'll vote on by this friday
[0:17:28] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> Amazon owns twitch which is a huge income for them. Same with youtube for google. They will more than likely fight this
[0:17:38] <+heroicleo> @brachydios777 ashit pie
[0:18:00] <+cvp5127> fucking boomers
[0:18:01] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL Woolie
[0:18:12] <thesilverbard> And defendants can opt-out, but they need to respond within 60 days of the claim
[0:18:15] <brachydios777> This senator is the same DNA as those who think games make people kill
[0:18:18] <Leddy_at_Home> @TheNihilistEnthusiast Actually, Youtube barely makes money for Google, they are pretty much just barely paying for it's own existence
[0:18:18] <CaptainBright> Oh right; I fucking forgot how fucking stupid, utterly stupid bills are tacked on in both houses of Congress in America
[0:18:20] <Twistedwolfie> The truth is that nobody really cares about streamer problems
[0:18:33] <+MetroidPrimeRib> boomers dont care about that shit and I dunno what his district looks like. it can be nearly impossible for entrenched senators to lose
[0:18:40] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus he won't have another election for 2-4 years. He almost lost to a dude who cheated with disabled vets wives. Only won by 2%
[0:18:46] <au_d3n> Once you’ve made yourself known as a YouTuber or twitch streamer, and this happens there is a VERY HIGH chance it will be impossible to go back to working a regular job
[0:18:46] <%jiggy_snipe> it's the state of North Carolina btw
[0:18:54] <brachydios777> George Carlin was right
[0:18:58] <+freeizone> riaa moves
[0:19:03] <+CatastropheCorvid> @WoolieVersus That won't happen. Just like the last few times they tried this, they'll just block the bill, and this guy will quietly try some other BS.
[0:19:14] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> Youtube made 15 billion dollars for google last year. What are you on about?
[0:19:20] <heartlesshealer> shit should not be allowed to be added to a bill after it passes the house of representatives. That's how people sneak evil shit into law
[0:19:22] <+Kyma1020> Us really needs to repeal Citizens United
[0:19:34] <CaptainBright> ..........and this is how we get government shutdowns, ladies and gents
[0:19:34] <au_d3n> It almost sounds like they are legitimately backing online content creators into a corner

[0:23:12] <+ZoltanBMagnus> AOc is now on twitch and now republicans want to criminalize streamers!
[0:23:13] <+MetroidPrimeRib> theres like a 20% chance that's the reason why
[0:23:21] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I doubt it but I wouldn't be surprised
[0:23:21] <CaptainBright> hell, Nancy Pelosi will just be by Kamala's side and just huffing her ice-cream
[0:23:33] <+cvp5127> we're sorry

[0:24:16] <DatAsuna> crazy knows no borders
[0:24:17] <CaptainBright> Trudeau in brownface can't protect you from Kamala and Nancy Pelosi from possibly imprisoning your youth
[0:24:20] <+cvp5127> stupid is infectious

[0:24:22] <Leddy_at_Home> What? QAnon is literally only works in America from what I know
[0:24:22] <brachydios777> That makes no god damn sense
[0:24:22] <+JingKaisean> So QAnon actually retouched photos of Trudeau to brownface?
[0:24:27] <OblivionSword1> even people outside of the american continent could be affected
[0:24:36] <+VHGS> canadians need adrenochrome too, man
[0:24:37] <theanora1> We are being ruined by unchecked capitalism
[0:24:43] <ColbyBryant> There’s maga guys in Canada. Shits funny as fuck

[0:25:22] <@akuda_bar> nanomachines can't get covid
[0:25:27] <alrobot2014> i wanna become juro's nanomachines
[0:25:27] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna be a nano machine
[0:25:34] <au_d3n> Of course!

[0:25:37] <Leddy_at_Home> SO rip
[0:25:37] <%Asuterisuku> I'm not entirely caught up with the anime yet, but I'll be glad to sit in on the manga today.
[0:25:39] <+cvp5127> KAMALA NO
[0:25:39] <irfan_> oh yeah this is a video game stream
[0:25:39] <+sewermonk> speaking of nanomachine fuckery
[0:25:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KAMALA TIME?
[0:25:40] <Mr_Strut> When nanomachines are the better alternative
[0:25:47] <brachydios777> I would like to be Nanomachines
[0:25:48] <%kyh9> FUCKING HELL
[0:25:52] <wichothemisticalwizard> Reggie's face looks like "dud what you talking about?"
[0:25:55] <+JingKaisean> imagine if the Game Awards gets DMCA'd midstream
[0:26:00] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna be a magical gun
[0:26:04] <DatAsuna> I'll be watching paige then, soz
[0:26:09] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I wont let the new world order hitman megumi yakushiji inject me with the mind control nanomachines
[0:26:10] <+cvp5127> no fun allowed
[0:26:12] <heartlesshealer> pat and paige can risk it, Woolie has too much riding on channel. Don't risk it
[0:26:12] <+Daxalog> Can I get the Matrix please. But the good sim. Not the the neutral sim.
[0:26:13] <DatAsuna> Imagine if Paige gets extradited xD
[0:26:14] <%jiggy_snipe> I still think you should use this day to catch up your projects since people might be watching the awards anyway
[0:26:14] <%Asuterisuku> RIP Reggie.
[0:26:14] <+YaBish311> 13 sentinels is better anyways
[0:26:15] <%fairore> @jingkaisean yo
[0:26:18] <@akuda_bar> don't go, Jason Waterfalls BibleThump
[0:26:26] <au_d3n> Lol Master Keef
[0:26:29] <Mr_Strut> That's how politics works
[0:26:29] <%kyh9> Pork
[0:26:29] <DatAsuna> Riders, man
[0:26:30] <%TheLemuroid> They always do that
[0:26:34] <heartlesshealer> ???
[0:26:45] <DatAsuna> insert simpsons clip about perverted arts bill here
[0:26:48] <CaptainBright> like I mentioned, this is how we get government shutdowns
[0:26:57] <KaitlynnHere> Gotta bury that shit
[0:26:58] <%TheNihilistEnthusiast> The actual scary part is that the Republicans control the House and Senate so they can totally push it all the way thru @WoolieVersus
[0:27:05] <Leddy_at_Home> Yeah, same shit appeared in the Green New Deal, pretty much how you make politics now, shove your shitty tactics in the actual necessary or good bills
[0:27:07] <brachydios777> Republican politicians make everything worse
[0:27:18] <theanora1> Repubs only control the senate
[0:27:22] <heartlesshealer> Absolutely everyone knows it's corrupt and that Congress was the true enemy of the USA since forever
[0:27:25] <+JingKaisean> @TheNihilistEnthusiast that's not true, dems have control of house
[0:27:33] <%jiggy_snipe> this would be shocking if a government shutdown wasn't uncommon and the covid relief has been non existent for a while
[0:27:45] <Zeif00> Brain rot is contagious, sorry us down here
[0:27:49] <@akuda_bar> optimistic that you think voters in north carolina read the news
[0:27:55] <CaptainBright> This is why some of us love Reinhard and the Empire in LotGH; we need a benevolent dictator to implement reforms
[0:27:56] <hassanico2> I'm confused, I just came in why are we full US politics?
[0:27:57] <wichothemisticalwizard> in what country?
[0:27:59] <%X2Eliah> So basically Twitch is DOOMED.
[0:28:02] <wichothemisticalwizard> Canada or the US?
[0:28:04] <hassanico2> Like, what brought up the topic?
[0:28:05] <au_d3n> XD
[0:28:06] <DatAsuna> >North carolina
[0:28:08] <DatAsuna> >reading
[0:28:13] <+freeizone> evil too strong
[0:28:22] <heartlesshealer> @hassanico2 north carolina
[0:28:22] <theanora1> Repubs know how to politic, but only use it for evel
[0:28:24] <%fairore> @x2eliah yep yep
[0:28:24] <brachydios777> @wichothemisticalwizard Wanna take a guess?
[0:28:25] <thesilverbard> If it makes you feel better, it will almost certainly be removed from the omnibus bill before it goes to a vote
