[0:04:20] <JustRandall> only ever knew there was a starfox 64 what is this starfox 2 chat speaks of

[0:04:23] <ggbhtg> We lost Peppy's VA to Covid early on, yeah....
[0:04:25] <+aishman> @Mr_Strut It never officially came out till the SNES mini and now the Switch Online.
[0:04:26] <ggbhtg> RIP
[0:04:31] <+chosenjuan42> it was the snes sequel that never came out
[0:04:31] <ggbhtg> Big RIP
[0:04:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It was slotted to be released on SNES, but canceled because 64 was less than a year away
[0:04:45] <%Prevot> I wonder when they're gonna make Star Fox 3 through 63
[0:04:48] <+MayorRev> What system are you playing on
[0:04:52] <%DreyfussFrost> @RandMastaFlex A game Nintendo finished but never released because they didn't want to distract from SF64.

[0:18:32] <$Lunaar> Still - booklet? LOL
[0:18:45] <ggbhtg> read dat manual anyway tho
[0:18:49] <RamenRiderZ> If you need instruction on how to kill the alien scum, check out the enclosed instruction book
[0:18:52] <$Lunaar> did the SNES classic come with an irl manual?
[0:18:54] <%DreyfussFrost> C is classic Star Fox
[0:19:07] <ggbhtg> the encloooosed instruction book
[0:19:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> That one's a girl because it has a bow
[0:19:16] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus C is Star Fox 1 style.
[0:19:18] <+chosenjuan42> inverted much better in cockpit
[0:19:32] <ggbhtg> @JetpackMcQuack what about the other girl then?
[0:19:40] <DatAsuna> speaking of cockpit view i still need to play star qars squadrons
[0:19:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> whipHmm unsure
[0:19:53] <DatAsuna> i also meed to inish the starlink star fox campaign lol
[0:19:55] <andre11dr> It's a cat
[0:19:59] <%Theycallmenerf> Did this game spawn furries?

[0:20:04] <@akuda_bar> g o o d l u c k
[0:20:05] <andre11dr> Cat=girl
[0:20:13] <+jiggy_snipe> alot of things spawned furries
[0:20:14] <GenkoForrest> there's a cockpit view toggle in the pause menu in battle.
[0:20:14] <DopeyDragon> @Theycallmenerf This game never came out lmao
[0:20:16] <$emptyantics> good ruck
[0:20:17] <andre11dr> At least in Japan
[0:20:22] <+chosenjuan42> Star Furry
[0:20:28] <dreadedcthulhu> @theycallmenerf ancient Egypt spawned furries
[0:20:30] <+Ultimate_Edge> Every second you move they move. NO MISTAKES
[0:20:31] <%Theycallmenerf> @dopeydragon But did Star Fox breed furries?
[0:20:35] <RamenRiderZ> Animal fables spawned furries
[0:20:44] <DopeyDragon> @WoolieVersus Adventure did, I guess.
[0:20:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Lola Bunny spawned furries
[0:20:57] <+wunp_fxs> texuka spawned furries
[0:21:01] <+wunp_fxs> tezuka*
[0:21:02] <%DreyfussFrost> Oh yeah, the charged laser originated in this game, if it had come out.
[0:21:04] <dinnydanny777> This song is a bop though
[0:21:07] <ggbhtg> imagine thinking furry-ism isn't ingrained in society, you had no chance
[0:21:13] <%DreyfussFrost> And all-range mode
[0:21:13] <%JuliusGemstone> the game is so good
[0:21:16] <asbestos_man45> It's so awesome that we finally got to play a (somewhat) proper version of this.
[0:21:21] <DopeyDragon> VERY impressive for SNES
[0:21:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> intercept successful!
[0:21:31] <andre11dr> Hold on ,are ancient Egyptian gods Furrys ?
[0:21:32] <%Prevot> the virgin blast processing woolieVS the chad Super FX
[0:21:41] <JustRandall> this the furry mod for star wars squadrons?
[0:21:56] <prime_name> Ooof those frames
[0:21:57] <andre11dr> That counts
[0:21:58] <KnivesEve> charge shot huh. i guess there some things star fox 64 got from this
[0:22:01] <GenkoForrest> again: pause menu has a View toggle.
[0:22:04] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Select switched views in Star Fox 1, though someone in chat said it was on the pause menu.
[0:22:05] <dinnydanny777> Are all Romans furries because of Romulus and Remus? limesO
[0:22:17] <ggbhtg> @KnivesEve a couple Kappa
[0:22:18] <%Theycallmenerf> Being born 1996 woolieVS games that came out in 96 or before and discovering new shit but it’s old shit.
[0:22:22] <+chosenjuan42> yes
[0:22:23] <+Ultimate_Edge> All space interceptions are default first person. Planets have default 3rd person
[0:22:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> all of this game is ARM
[0:22:33] <RamenRiderZ> Roman velites were weaponized furries

[0:24:57] <Lancaster_H> uninverted flying in general really
[0:25:22] <shadowcrisis> So Woolie prepping for Star Wars Squadrons eh. Gotta get his force on in star fox 2
[0:25:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> tbh the only flying game I play inverted is ace combat
[0:25:34] <SomersaultJustice> use the boost to chase
[0:25:36] <asbestos_man45> psshh aiming reticle in 3rd person? This ain't Starfox Kappa
[0:25:49] <armchairmaster_> That turning sensitivity is SHARP
[0:25:59] <extradopeness> Try a somersault
[0:25:59] <NeonNobleKalzeria> This game was initially scrapped because it wasn't as impressive as the incoming Star Fox 64, and the aiming in this game really shows that. XP
[0:26:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie looking at his ship and not the targeting reticle chiikaDed
[0:26:21] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus So if you're wondering about having a HOMING charge shot....that's an upgrade pick up.
[0:26:34] <SomersaultJustice> TRAI A SOMARSALT!
[0:26:45] <+Ultimate_Edge> DO A BARREL ROLL
[0:26:56] <ggbhtg> The unfinished ROM had homing charge shots by default, and this release nerfed that
[0:27:02] <ggbhtg> for SOME reason...
[0:27:14] <%DreyfussFrost> Does it feel to anyone else like Woolie's aim got worse after changing controls? LUL
[0:27:16] <%1000_buffers> AND VIDEO GAME GRAPHICS NEVER GOT ANY BETTER
[0:27:19] <@akuda_bar> it looks like it controls better in first person lol
[0:27:21] <+Freeborg1997> What's the best Star Fox?
[0:27:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> tfw the 1.0 patch nerfs your favorite weapons
[0:27:22] <+Dova573> this reminds me of the spaceship stages from super star wars
[0:27:42] <ggbhtg> I N N O V A T E
[0:27:46] <prime_name> Not to be rude, but it seems like your fighting the controls more than the ships
[0:27:50] <+jiggy_snipe> yea maybe 1st person would be better
[0:27:50] <asbestos_man45> Don't fix what ain't broke
[0:27:55] <ggbhtg> even if it sucks, gotta innovate
[0:27:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> No, screw that, ARM all the time, tunnel flying plebians
[0:28:08] <%Lion_kun> THAT LOOK LIKE ANDROSS!
[0:28:10] <%DreyfussFrost> The real problem is looks like to me is that the ship doesn't recenter when you release the dpad, unless you aren't releasing it.
[0:28:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> ALL KEKS MODE OMEGALUL
[0:28:22] <Lancaster_H> @prime_name thats woolie in a nutshell, fighting controls more than the objective LUL
[0:28:29] <armchairmaster_> Unlocked charge shots ONLY work once you really become a speedrunner in Star Fox 64
[0:28:34] <%Solidnick18> this looks rough
[0:28:38] <+Ultimate_Edge> If you take too long, they will escape and you got to chase them on the map
[0:28:41] <GenkoForrest> wow that low shield sound effect is the same one one that SF command has.
[0:28:53] <rcand9> woolie is having a big trouble

[0:32:00] <prime_name> Star Fox Assult this is not
[0:32:09] <%Solidnick18> this is wonky lol
[0:32:13] <+ConAirOnDVD> swiggety swooty
[0:32:17] <ggbhtg> for one thing, you gotta collect ALL those coins, to get Homing charged shots by default
[0:32:21] <+Ultimate_Edge> Yippe! You did it!
[0:32:22] <DatAsuna> assault was not great on foot but sick in the vehicles
[0:32:23] <andre11dr> That FX chip doing work
[0:32:26] <Dave_VD> I never knew the ships could walk
[0:32:28] <dinnydanny777> Has to do the spin around for style points limesO
[0:32:30] <GenkoForrest> you can see how much they supremely cannibalized this game in future titles.
[0:32:32] <ggbhtg> TIME FORE CO PILOT REGGIE LUL
[0:32:35] <DatAsuna> yeah
[0:32:37] <SomersaultJustice> assault had great multiplayer
[0:32:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nah, Woolie, this is cool
[0:32:52] <+GrassCannon> I'm so sad I had no one to play assault multiplayer with
[0:32:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Have they mentioned what the extra thing is yet?
[0:32:52] <wolf_odonnell2919> can't let you do that Star Fox
[0:32:54] <Lancaster_H> man i gotta say this aint a good look
[0:32:58] <@akuda_bar> looks like rocket powered pencils
[0:33:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> that SuperFX is sweltering right now pray for it yall
[0:33:07] <GenkoForrest> assault was the only good Starfox sequel that nobody likes because nostalgia goggles.
[0:33:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> D:
[0:33:13] <ggbhtg> Y'all talking about Assualt, but that's literally the thing they put in Star Fox Zero
[0:33:19] <@Menitta> Star Fox ey
[0:33:23] <dinnydanny777> Assault is a masterpiece compared to Adventures
[0:33:26] <asbestos_man45> Star doggo OhMyDog
[0:33:33] <%flarebears> I dont think I have ever actually seen or played a star fox game in real life
[0:33:38] <rcand9> hit the targets
[0:33:40] <ggbhtg> @dinnydanny777 but they're literally different games
[0:33:41] <DopeyDragon> I could see someone remaking a game like this but with more Roguelike elements
[0:33:42] <%jinking79> Star Wolf Everywhere
[0:33:43] <KnivesEve> i want to play star fox64 now
[0:33:51] <+Dova573> hey adventure has its charm
[0:33:58] <SomersaultJustice> Cap'n Wolf Crunch
[0:33:58] <ggbhtg> Leon had a big yikes
[0:34:03] <asbestos_man45> reassign charge shot to L2
[0:34:04] <dinnydanny777> @ggbhtg Sure, but Assault's middle part through to the ending doesn't suck
[0:34:05] <RamenRiderZ> Star Fox VR, come on Nintendo, get on that VR train
[0:34:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> YIKESIRONI
[0:34:18] <%DreyfussFrost> @ggbhtg Which is why one is a masterpiece and the other isn't.
[0:34:24] <DopeyDragon> S P A C E D R A G O N
[0:34:25] <SomersaultJustice> This is the enemy's bioweapon!?
[0:34:25] <wolf_odonnell2919> speaking of Star Wolf I'm in the channel
[0:34:26] <ggbhtg> fight this Dragoon shit btw
[0:34:30] <neuronova> this seems a bit like the ds starfox
[0:34:44] <SomersaultJustice> I forgot if you can heal in this game
[0:34:44] <%1000_buffers> @WoolieVersus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAqnKIKmRAY
[0:34:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> SPACE DRAGON OHROWCHEE?
[0:34:48] <NeonNobleKalzeria> I think you can heal up at the base? it's been a while
[0:34:58] <DopeyDragon> Mirage Dragon is the best name
[0:35:03] <mesamus> you are crashing with it
[0:35:04] <Jaketify> monkaS
[0:35:05] <+wunp_fxs> this game looks frustrating as hell
[0:35:06] <Lancaster_H> dude this framerate is roouuughhh
[0:35:15] <%mrlastchance1> big frames
[0:35:20] <KnivesEve> maybe first person mode would work better?
[0:35:24] <dinnydanny777> It looks really hard to turn
[0:35:34] <Picia000123> This framerate is making me feel old
[0:35:37] <prime_name> I think thats a bad thing
[0:35:37] <PanicSwytch> Gud ruk
[0:35:40] <NeonNobleKalzeria> The game was kinda designed for first person mode
[0:35:41] <+jiggy_snipe> chug chug
[0:35:44] <@Solidus_113> it looks like 12 fps
[0:35:49] <rcand9> rip fox
[0:35:50] <dinnydanny777> limesHeck

[0:38:00] <SomersaultJustice> no enemy shields analyzed
[0:38:05] <Lancaster_H> Woolie once again REFUSING to play the game the way it's intended LUL
[0:38:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Is there an HD GameCube button
[0:38:24] <neuronova> is starfox 1 on the switch online thing?
[0:38:27] <%doomerskeletor13> @lancaster_h As is tradition
[0:38:35] <SomersaultJustice> @neuronova yes
[0:38:41] <ExpressNode> @neuronova They are both on there
[0:38:56] <DopeyDragon> This game is definitely ambitious, you can't fault it for that.
[0:38:58] <neuronova> @somersaultjustice ahh thanks, might just get it PogChamp
[0:39:00] <%1000_buffers> @WoolieVersus will you ever do a "get into fighting games" for Brawl woolieGLORY

[0:39:38] <lessthanhuman_tv> a get into fighting games for 64 would be interesting but brawl LUL
[0:39:38] <brunoberserk> OOF
[0:39:42] <neuronova> @dopeydragon yeah, but u also cant fault them for deciding not to release it
[0:39:57] <+Ultimate_Edge> There is a reason they default that in first person LUL
[0:40:09] <DopeyDragon> @WoolieVersus Lock on is an unlock
[0:40:25] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus If you're feeling GUTSY, you can go straight for Corneria
[0:40:28] <ggbhtg> er
[0:40:30] <ggbhtg> Venom
[0:40:43] <+CuppaKofe> the Star Fox boss minigames in Wario Ware Smooth Moves makes me want a proper 60 fps Star Fox 1 so bad.
[0:40:48] <ggbhtg> Destroy Corneria yourself LUL
[0:40:59] <rufus2k2> @WoolieVersus imagine if they got a 3rd party dev like the devil Engine guys to make Star Fox into a 2D Vertical/horizontal shmup
[0:41:17] <SomersaultJustice> PEPPY, LONG TIME NO SEE
[0:41:19] <%Solidnick18> pigmaaa

[0:41:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @rufus2k2
[0:41:25] <jasonisgold79> Huh, Star Fox 2? Neat. What made Woolie want to play this, out of curiosity.
[0:41:26] <+jiggy_snipe> oh god it's Pigma
[0:41:32] <ExpressNode> Just space Ganon
[0:41:33] <waffleandman> I could probably never play 1 and 2 because of the fps
[0:41:35] <%Livelinne> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:41:36] <DopeyDragon> Your daddy scream REAAAAAAAL good before he DIED
[0:41:37] <+CuppaKofe> I'm sorry, but you've contracted Pigma.
[0:41:43] <neuronova> pigma betrayed cloud and the starfox team!
[0:41:49] <brunoberserk> Pigma : hey fox , remember when i betrayed your dad ?
[0:41:50] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Is that some sort of barrel roll?
[0:41:50] <rufus2k2> What's Pigma
[0:41:52] <lessthanhuman_tv> :(
[0:41:58] <ExpressNode> Music is pretty good though
[0:41:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Who the hell is Steve Jobs?
[0:42:00] <mesamus> he finally learsn the tech
[0:42:01] <%KyoryUtchy> I think the stages that take place on planets/ships are linear, and the 'all range mode' is for when you're just out in space
[0:42:09] <DianaTheAscian> Sigmas cousin
[0:42:10] <+Ultimate_Edge> My beautiful reward! BAHAHA
[0:42:15] <lessthanhuman_tv> I love the character portraits in this game
[0:42:19] <rcand9> pigma you traitorous shit boupheWhy
[0:42:27] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus If you're on Normal, you don't have to worry about Corneria getting hammered
[0:42:29] <rufus2k2> the commander's specs in this aren't as good as in SF1
[0:42:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> REPORT
[0:42:33] <+CuppaKofe> pigman you craved traitor!
[0:42:34] <SomersaultJustice> talking portraits are sick in any game, like mgs1
[0:42:35] <DopeyDragon> Now for the game's gimmick
[0:42:37] <andre11dr> No.1 was like that as well

[0:44:18] <Lancaster_H> okay jokes aside this stages frames is for real hurting my eyes holy shit
[0:44:20] <FrostedZaibatsu> This was the unreleased Star Fox right?
[0:44:24] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:44:28] <+CuppaKofe> There's probably a reason none of the SF2 music was reused for 64, though the title theme is still really good.
[0:44:42] <huskarl_zap> Song fucks eat your heart out extreme core metal
[0:44:49] <rcand9> sf2 is gonna make woolie hurl

[0:45:16] <%slimmixrp> Press switch

[0:49:08] <DigitalJoshie> holy shit this frame rate
[0:49:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> you did it
[0:49:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> I see why they didnt release this

[0:49:18] <ggbhtg> @neuronova i n n o v a t i o n
[0:49:29] <@Menitta> I still think its cool they released this on the SNES classic
[0:49:34] <+Ultimate_Edge> Safe to say StarFox is really only popular thanks to 64
[0:49:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> PLEASE JUST SWITCH TO GALAXY 2 WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH
[0:49:50] <DigitalJoshie> if its any consolation, this runs better than Star Fox 1 I think
[0:49:55] <%Prevot> let's be honest here Star Fox isnt actually popular at all
[0:49:55] <+jiggy_snipe> I like the ost at least
[0:50:04] <DianaTheAscian> this song is fine
[0:50:05] <Lancaster_H> it is cool as a novelty sure
[0:50:05] <andrewofbob> @frostedzaibatsu Nintendo doesn’t like anything unless it does something new technologically
[0:50:06] <ggbhtg> but we haven't played as FAYE yet!!! @FuqBoiSlim
[0:50:07] <Triforceriku> i love this game
[0:50:08] <Lancaster_H> but holy shit
[0:50:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:50:12] <SomersaultJustice> even though it's rough, I think this game is pretty neat
[0:50:23] <neuronova> man, i really hope we do get a worth 64/assault starfox game some time
[0:50:23] <ggbhtg> 95 or 99
[0:50:23] <DianaTheAscian> "95%"
[0:50:25] <+Dr_DangerPhD> game is pretty ambitious for the time it came out
[0:50:31] <@Solidus_113> last 5% probably testing and optimization
[0:50:34] <%slimmixrp> This fucking framerate kills the game everything else seems cool
[0:50:37] <@Menitta> Its like when Rodea the Sky Soldier came out on Wii U, they just packed in the Wii version
[0:50:37] <%YakumoYomi> That last 5% was probably optimization and QA
[0:50:39] <prime_name> maybe this is better to play than to watch
[0:50:45] <rcand9> woolie is figuring it out
[0:50:46] <+BonzoBeanMachine> 5 percent is framerate gottem
[0:50:46] <SomersaultJustice> these mother brain circles
[0:50:46] <+CuppaKofe> Star Fox 2 is more interesting for historical purposes and the development story, but I'm glad it's officially available regardless.
[0:50:51] <+Aeoneth> Your looking at 95% from a company that always gives 150%
[0:50:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NotLikeThis
[0:50:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:59] <DianaTheAscian> @prime_name Woolie says its not
[0:51:07] <ggbhtg> can you barrel roll in this mode?
[0:51:12] <+skyheys> hwwoof
[0:51:23] <@akuda_bar> i love the goofy chicken legs
[0:51:24] <FrostedZaibatsu> @andrewofbob Im good with "does it work perfectly" as a standard
[0:51:28] <Lancaster_H> fun fact: aiming at minus 15 fps is not a good time
[0:51:31] <rcand9> you bullets are bouncing back at you dude
[0:51:33] <%YakumoYomi> Are his reflected shots damaging him?
[0:51:35] <%DreyfussFrost> Getting hit by your own reflected shots LUL
[0:51:35] <+CuppaKofe> @Menitta Oh god, I'm glad I waited for NISA to heavily discount that game. Was worth it for the Wii version, but the WiiU version is so fucking baaaad.
[0:51:38] <+Ultimate_Edge> @ggbhtg No. The shoulder buttons turn the whole camera left or right
[0:51:52] <+skyheys> this game is more fun in overclocked bsnes
[0:51:56] <iloveTSA> 3 fps
[0:52:01] <%YakumoYomi> OOF
[0:52:02] <osaka_daioh> woah, Star Fox 2. didnt expect this!
[0:52:02] <SomersaultJustice> got the DK coin
[0:52:03] <andre11dr> Ok but for real my eyes are starting to hurt
[0:52:05] <DianaTheAscian> OOF
[0:52:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow this is rough
[0:52:12] <@Menitta> @CuppaKofe I need to get a Wii copy. I bought the Wii U version when it got delisted but only then did I learn it was shit
[0:52:12] <prime_name> this looks like a jank version of megaman legends
[0:52:13] <%Solidnick18> yay?
[0:52:13] <DianaTheAscian> THAT 12 FPS
[0:52:16] <%mrlastchance1> This is not pleaseant
[0:52:25] <Lancaster_H> wooliepls
[0:52:26] <ggbhtg> kore ga Circle Strafingu
[0:52:29] <Zayasu> WutFace
[0:52:30] <%slimmixrp> doodFPS
[0:52:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> AND THAT'S STAR FOX 2
[0:52:31] <%Prevot> part of the reason I never liked StarFox 1 was because this shitty ass framerate
[0:52:31] <Lancaster_H> end this nightmare
[0:52:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> At least its in tbe double digits
[0:52:34] <%DreyfussFrost> Circle strafing was a completely new concept on console at this time lol
[0:52:39] <%slimmixrp> doodFps doodFps doodFps doodFps doodFps doodFps doodFps doodFps doodFps woolieU woolieU woolieU
[0:52:39] <neuronova> I actually dig the low poly ships, but yeah, the framerate NotLikeThis
[0:52:40] <ggbhtg> you tried gold star indeed, but....
[0:52:41] <iloveTSA> DansGame
[0:52:46] <%YakumoYomi> Bois, we need that last "5%"
[0:52:50] <DianaTheAscian> lets see the star destroyer
[0:52:52] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Yes, you can repair your wingman at the mothership.
[0:52:52] <ggbhtg> FUCK IT, GO TO VENOM
[0:52:55] <%Lion_kun> I thought people said this was a good game lol
[0:52:56] <+Exicuren> You just need to get used to it, just let your eyes bleed for a while, you adjust to the pain Kappa
[0:53:00] <+JingKaisean> holy shit
[0:53:01] <%slimmixrp> Go to endgame
[0:53:02] <waffleandman> it looks so cool but also terrible LUL
[0:53:03] <+JingKaisean> what is this game?

[0:53:22] <@Solidus_113> this is the end
[0:53:23] <rcand9> well rip woolie
[0:53:24] <+JingKaisean> was this ever released?
[0:53:25] <+skyheys> @lion_kun Its good at 60fps on your computer
[0:53:29] <+CuppaKofe> @Menitta You can buy the Wii/WiiU bundle for like 20$, but you can also get just the Wii disc for like 6 bucks on Gamestop's website.
[0:53:46] <neuronova> @jingkaisean not until recently
[0:53:50] <KnivesEve> i feel bad for star fox since its a franchise that is always being used as a gunnie pig for something
[0:53:50] <%DreyfussFrost> Hold L/R while turning to turn faster.
[0:53:53] <+GrassCannon> "Shoot! He's right behind me!"
[0:54:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wtf is that timer?
[0:54:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> is there no u-turn in this game?
[0:54:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I can't ignore how weird it is
[0:54:17] <DianaTheAscian> its counting how long u take i think
[0:54:22] <+Ultimate_Edge> Oh yeah. You don't have bombs on peppy's class ship. Just shields.
[0:54:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> at least a somersault???
[0:54:26] <@Menitta> @CuppaKofe not even. Its now down to $3
[0:54:30] <%DreyfussFrost> @FuqBoiSlim No, but if Woolie held the shoulder button while turning he would turn faster.
[0:54:36] <rcand9> yeah you got this
[0:54:44] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, Corneria is slowly dying psaSmug
[0:54:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> what unit of measurement is 00.0? The seconds aren't even seconds
[0:54:49] <AppleBerryKitty> Oh for a moment I thought they were playing star fox adventures. I was about to start praying.
[0:54:50] <+CuppaKofe> @Menitta Holy shit, wow. Yeah, i'd jump on it for that price lol

[0:57:33] <%KyoryUtchy> It's clear with this game Nintendo's reach exceeded its grasp. It'd be interested to see this kind of Starfox game with modern technology, rather than just literally remaking StarFox 1 over and over again with prettier graphics.
[0:57:34] <%gatorafan> BILLIONS ARE DEAD

[1:08:33] <Laironx3> Don't get cocky, kid
[1:08:34] <KnivesEve> wow woolie sucks xD
[1:08:38] <Make_me_mad> Woolie might just be very bad at games. That is a possibility.
[1:08:40] <+Jonesman64> woolie needs to work on his flight skills
[1:08:44] <%Prevot> both games look bad to me but then again I'm not really a StarFox fan
[1:08:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> OMEGALUL
[1:08:46] <ggbhtg> i n n o v a t i o n
[1:08:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reminds me of Command
[1:08:54] <ggbhtg> space drama
[1:08:58] <%Proxzo> Eventually they just moved some of these ideas onto Starfox 64
[1:09:02] <ggbhtg> ^
[1:09:04] <@Menitta> I like the Wario Ware game of this
[1:09:04] <NekoZen> well it never technically came out
[1:09:10] <AkumaHokoru> nah woolie was nust trying to do too much
[1:09:12] <+GrassCannon> the rails are star fox
[1:09:16] <AkumaHokoru> its ok
[1:09:18] <+skyheys> "I didnt beat the game in one try so bad game" InuyoFace
[1:09:19] <neuronova> hardware just wasn't made for sf2
[1:09:24] <%Proxzo> Then they tried to do Starfox Command
[1:09:25] <DopeyDragon> Start Fox 2 was too ambitious for the hardware
[1:09:37] <%DreyfussFrost> It's a shame they NEVER made a sequel to this amazing game.
[1:09:38] <ggbhtg> SF2 IS a rough game through and through tho
[1:09:42] <osaka_daioh> they definitely did
[1:09:47] <+skyheys> @ggt
[1:09:51] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Star Fox 2 could work now like if it was remade for current gen
[1:09:53] <osaka_daioh> they would have ruined it early and forever
[1:09:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> if SF2 was S64 would it be gold
[1:09:56] <+skyheys> @ggbhtg Yeah.
[1:10:04] <bigshedman> Woolie just remember your Blanka skills: Mash that punch button and keep using rolls. And keep using footsies to keep distance!
[1:10:17] <pixel_river> is it wrong i want a new star fox to be like Sin and Punishment in action and pace ?
[1:10:28] <ggbhtg> the devs got together for drinks after the SNES mini port came out, there's a bar pic
[1:10:34] <ggbhtg> they chillin
[1:10:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> HEY EINSTEIN
[1:10:35] <Rawklobstah88> So Imissed it

[1:11:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Imagine Star Fox Command, but running on a SNES
[1:11:17] <Rawklobstah88> that's no good
[1:11:23] <neuronova> incoming enemy from the rear, drop attitude!
[1:11:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @Rawklobstah88 Star Fox 2: Part 1/1
[1:11:44] <+skyheys> @canadiananimatorguy Except well designed. it's mostly the framerate and being hard that's a problem
[1:11:45] <Laironx3> Star Fox 2 got shafted for SF64. But SF2 is also available on emulation, so it's fine either way.
[1:11:45] <+wunp_fxs> this makes me want to play panzer dragoon zwie
[1:11:48] <%DreyfussFrost> Oh my god Woolie you have shoulder buttons.
[1:11:48] <theredfox930000> star fox and metroid and fzero are franchises that Nintendo doesn't know what to do with

[1:12:07] <ChungusQuest> My Emperor...I've faaiiiiled yyoouuuuu!!
[1:12:09] <ggbhtg> cuz why not
[1:12:09] <DopeyDragon> I never thought about it, but the hard boss on Corneria 64 was basically a remake of this boss.
[1:12:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1313474077307396101?s=19
[1:12:10] <pixel_river> now time for Adventures
[1:12:11] <Make_me_mad> Woolie can't play Star Fox. This is fairly clear by now. That said Star Fox 2 isn't great.
[1:12:19] <ggbhtg> Some of the devs got together for drinks after the SNES mini port came out, AND ALSO SWERY WAS THERE LUL. cuz why not @WoolieVersus
[1:12:22] <bigshedman> @theredfox930000 Which is kinda dumb because combining those 3 franchises would just be fucking sick. Have a shared Nintendo sci-fi universe.
[1:12:22] <+Lath_Lunair> They've been struggling with "just do that" for years
[1:12:29] <neuronova> @slimmixrp 64 3d exists
[1:12:31] <ggbhtg> still progress!
[1:12:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> This makes me want to play the 3ds port of 64 I'll see y'all later
[1:12:35] <+ChaosEmralds> cancelled.
[1:12:41] <%AceOne5> does Woolie know about the warp trick?
[1:12:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> NEXT GAME
[1:12:49] <Laironx3> Hold down your frigging shoulder buttons to turn your ship to dodge better.
[1:12:49] <+Jonesman64> 64 was pretty peak
[1:12:51] <%slimmixrp> @neuronova smh only handheld Im sadge
[1:12:51] <ggbhtg> Destiny is Destiny
[1:12:52] <%YakumoYomi> Metroid's had a pretty good run. Federation Force was a dud, but Other M (aside from plot/characters) and Samus Returns Remake were solid
[1:12:54] <%DreyfussFrost> Can barely handle 10 degrees of motion, how can anyone expect him to handle 360? LUL
[1:12:54] <rcand9> now go to 64
[1:12:55] <Ryan1016> Always have 64
[1:12:59] <+Aeoneth> 64 is still really good too
[1:13:06] <+Jajanken4> we still have star fox adventures :)
[1:13:08] <ggbhtg> now go play 64 10 times in a row
[1:13:10] <%Mr_Strut> 64 LP?
[1:13:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Yo, FOR REAL?
[1:13:15] <DatAsuna> buy 64 3ds to save star fox said miyamoto
[1:13:16] <pixel_river> LUL
[1:13:17] <KnivesEve> so 64 time?
[1:13:19] <ggbhtg> because that's all we really have doodSad
[1:13:19] <@Menitta> Star Fox started at Command Kappa
[1:13:19] <%YakumoYomi> His smile and optimism. GONE.
[1:13:20] <DianaTheAscian> Galaxy time!!!
[1:13:20] <@Solidus_113> time for the real LP
[1:13:21] <CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[1:13:23] <+Mrbaconator> hour and A HALF
[1:13:26] <Tooniearcade> kmaHmm1
[1:13:26] <osaka_daioh> .......YEP
[1:13:28] <andre11dr> So 64 right?
[1:13:28] <cero_5> prefer 2 to this but they're both amazing
[1:13:29] <NeonNobleKalzeria> so, when's Zero
[1:13:30] <$emptyantics> time for the REAL LP
[1:13:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AND 64
[1:13:31] <brunoberserk> well this scalated quickly
[1:13:32] <+GrassCannon> All of Star Fox (any%)
[1:13:33] <@Menitta> Its a super cool novelty
[1:13:34] <osaka_daioh> That's THAT.
[1:13:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> !Uptime
[1:13:34] <+Legit_Raccoon> flushed
[1:13:34] <prime_name> nice bonus guys
[1:13:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 27 minutes
[1:13:38] <+jiggy_snipe> it's nice to see it
[1:13:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Curiosity killed the cat
[1:13:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Star Fox 1+2: Part 1/1 - 5 minutes long LUL
[1:13:45] <ggbhtg> a period piece, if you will
[1:13:51] <SomersaultJustice> so what is next
[1:13:52] <+jiggy_snipe> it needs the benefit of pc emulation I think
[1:13:52] <%gnoame> Now wondering why it wasn't out anymore
[1:13:54] <DopeyDragon> @WoolieVersus The rom was a beta and uncomplete
[1:13:55] <osaka_daioh> THAT SUCKED
[1:13:56] <+Jonesman64> Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back
[1:13:57] <%Prevot> @BallerSwagBro9k Curiosity killed the Krystal
[1:13:59] <ggbhtg> Star Fox 2: Part 0.62
[1:14:00] <%AceOne5> hype
[1:14:02] <+ChaosEmralds> we have 1,64, and assault at least
[1:14:02] <+skyheys> The prototype version was way easier
[1:14:04] <@Solidus_113> leave it to Nintendo to never update or improve their old games
[1:14:05] <overkrustice> The new pilots are cute
[1:14:05] <CappuccinoGuil> This is real coward hours YEYEYEYE

[1:14:26] <+jiggy_snipe> yea lol
[1:14:26] <%DreyfussFrost> SUCH good designs though
[1:14:29] <%AceOne5> this music makes me want to get on some Mario Paint
[1:14:30] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe
[1:14:30] <DianaTheAscian> but they looked cool
[1:14:32] <DopeyDragon> They've NEVER been back
[1:14:34] <prime_name> they got replaced super hard
[1:14:35] <$Lunaar> I just had a virtual meeting at work with the stream muted in the background since you started Star Fox 2 - Question: what the fuck did I just watch

[1:21:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lol no it was a joke!
[1:21:58] <%DreyfussFrost> OOF
[1:21:59] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus still not enough/no Kirby Lps though
[1:22:00] <CappuccinoGuil> I very much enjoyed the Woolie Dips His Toes In Star Fox 2 And Then Cowards Out hour
[1:22:00] <Lancaster_H> super mario world was my jam
[1:22:00] <+skyheys> WHERE THAT FF6 AT

[1:22:10] <DopeyDragon> 6 is a MUST PLAY
[1:22:15] <%DreyfussFrost> Dodged all the good ones
[1:22:15] <DedlokPM> woolieYE TRIPLE TRIAD
[1:22:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 6 is the best one dude
[1:22:16] <ggbhtg> About Fay: "The daughter of an aristocratic family, she has relinquished high society and taken up arms to defend her home planet." She was Karin Kanzuki in dog form! @WoolieVersus
[1:22:18] <DianaTheAscian> @SirGO0SE OH U MISSED IT
[1:22:23] <andre11dr> 6 is probably the best one
[1:22:23] <@Solidus_113> I've only played FF13-2 and FF14
[1:22:24] <%Lion_kun> And remake?
[1:22:25] <+jiggy_snipe> so 1 7 10 15?
[1:22:25] <ChungusQuest> Yo, can we get a Triple Triad stream?
[1:22:26] <dreadedcthulhu> remake of 1 is good, 4-6 are all stellar, 3 is the first one with a job system but the difficulty spike at the end is dumb
[1:22:26] <brunoberserk> a bunch of ff8 , you mean triple triad ?
[1:22:30] <%DreyfussFrost> Good on you Reggie!
[1:22:32] <@Menitta> I only played XV
[1:22:33] <+deviljhojho_> 6 is the king of the nes to snes era FF
[1:22:42] <@Menitta> XVI looks fire
[1:22:43] <TraitGene2> trigger probably takes it tho
[1:22:44] <%SirGO0SE> @DianaTheAscian NotLikeThis noooo
[1:22:44] <%Lion_kun> FF7R?
[1:22:46] <%DreyfussFrost> You dodged all the good ones Woolie. 5, 6, 12... 14 Kappa
[1:22:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SAME REG
[1:22:56] <+deviljhojho_> I'd say trigger does win it
[1:23:00] <HyperSonicX99> XV is my first Final Fantasy game I played lol
[1:23:03] <jaid251> 5 is the best one
[1:23:03] <+deviljhojho_> not by much but it does
[1:23:05] <%DreyfussFrost> But yeah, Trigger is better than all FF
[1:23:06] <+skyheys> WHERE DAT SPIKE MCFANG
[1:23:10] <%chll0ne> ff6 is the best to me
[1:23:13] <DianaTheAscian> my ff experience is 1, 14 and the first 10hrs of 7
[1:23:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> No time like the present
[1:23:14] <andre11dr> Also FF14 is really good, but im sure Woolie has heard that enough
[1:23:23] <%gnoame> Call me when Golden Sun comes up, game needs a Remaster / Remake for Switch
[1:23:24] <%a_goth_pancake> CT was the first rpg I ever beat
[1:23:26] <HyperSonicX99> At least I played the original of 7 and the remake
[1:23:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Just DL a rom Woolz
[1:23:28] <Laironx3> Fair enough.
[1:23:32] <TraitGene2> i didn't play trigger until i could emulate it
[1:23:41] <SomersaultJustice> we all know you're not against roms woolie
[1:23:41] <brunoberserk> do a super metroid lp , do it coward
[1:23:43] <+Aeoneth> I feel Woolie on this... The only way i was able to weasle in any singleplayer game was by making a rule that every death or level we would switch who was on controls
[1:23:46] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder whens Woolie is just gonna watch the ff14 plot
[1:23:52] <JdotSweapA> stream ending?
[1:23:52] <MichaelDood> If only Dissidia had existed LUL
[1:24:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @JdotSweapA setting up next game

[1:24:14] <HyperSonicX99> I never played Chrono Trigger nor 6...I wasn’t keen into RPG back then lol
[1:24:15] <@Menitta> I remember playing CT on Vita during AP physics and my teacher marked out
[1:24:17] <JdotSweapA> @CanadianAnimatorGuy thanks
[1:24:26] <SomersaultJustice> and SF2 was a "pretty good" fighting game
[1:24:28] <Ryan1016> LUL
[1:24:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @skyheys I streamed that the other day, it was DIFFICULT
[1:24:32] <andre11dr> I never played FF 1 2 3 5 9 and never finished 13

[1:24:42] <cero_5> @skyheys LOVE that game, so cool that it's on Steam

[1:24:44] <DatAsuna> Ask for blazing lasers
[1:24:45] <%Solidnick18> it's a very good game
[1:24:46] <+skyheys> @canadiananimatorguy It's a good game
[1:24:48] <Potatoidea> Ooh
[1:24:50] <leomuratore> Games were very expensive, and the priorities were games the kids could play together
[1:24:51] <ofodojo> PogChamp
[1:24:52] <%Mr_Strut> What could it be?
[1:24:58] <ggbhtg> The game that Nintendo REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE
[1:24:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> When u starting streaming Reg?
[1:24:59] <DianaTheAscian> Famacon mini
[1:25:00] <+Aeoneth> Megaman Legends LP?
[1:25:00] <@Menitta> Oh wow thats adorable
[1:25:00] <%Prevot> now how is the controls situation gonna be for Galaxy 2

[1:25:04] <Pyrenity> Wait no star fox 2? Did I miss it. :(
[1:25:09] <%SirGO0SE> :O
[1:25:13] <ChungusQuest> oooohh, aaaaahh
[1:25:14] <ggbhtg> THE FORBIDDEN MARIO GAME
[1:25:15] <Rawklobstah88> Famicommmm
[1:25:18] <%Javaa01> Micro B
[1:25:19] <DianaTheAscian> @Pyrenity yup
[1:25:21] <%SirGO0SE> @Pyrenity same :( i didnt get a notification
[1:25:22] <+skyheys> @pyrenity Woolie hated it InuyoFace
[1:25:26] <Make_me_mad> @Pyrenity They played it and hated it.
[1:25:27] <%DreyfussFrost> FF5 is the second best of the singleplayer FFs, if you play the fanmade RPGe version. The official ports are unfortunately trash.
[1:25:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember 10 year old me bringing my DS Lite to class and along Pokemkn Diamond and my teacher marking out over Pokemkn Silver and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about the entire time
[1:25:32] <HyperSonicX99> GRAND...DAD
[1:25:33] <@Menitta> It could just be on Wii U
[1:25:34] <Pyrenity> Awww BibleThump
[1:25:53] <+Aeoneth> @FuqBoiSlim Why must you make me feel old
[1:25:56] <+skyheys> @canadiananimatorguy Honestly,play the newer ones first, they're easier
[1:25:57] <@Menitta> Does the 2nd one have a microphone
[1:25:58] <%SirGO0SE> did that come out along side the GB Micro? has a similar vibe
[1:26:00] <+deviljhojho_> maybe it never came out for a reason
[1:26:03] <Chaos_kun> Did SNES or famicom have better hardware?
[1:26:06] <%KyoryUtchy> StarFox is a bit of a schizophrenic series where half the games are wildly experimental and the other half play it SO safe that they're literally just remaking the first game over and over. It's never really been able to find a middle ground where it's able to keep the good stuff while still build on it and advance it.
[1:26:10] <%Darmanimon> controller one has a microphone on the original super Famicom too
[1:26:16] <Kghaleon> Nintendo gave me a free copy of Galaxy 2 so I loaded it onto my roommates Wii U, but then he sold it the next week.
[1:26:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:17] <%Darmanimon> sorry regular famicom
[1:26:17] <@Menitta> @Chaos_kun Famicom is Japanes NES
[1:26:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> @aeoneth its my contractual obligation as a Zoomer
[1:26:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @skyheys I played the one that was on sale on steam a little bit ago. I think it was a PSP port
[1:26:32] <+wunp_fxs> so tiny
[1:26:35] <+NeddieSpaghetti> StarFox OWLdeadeye OWLdeadeye OWLdeadeye
[1:26:41] <@Menitta> thats adorable
[1:26:43] <DianaTheAscian> was star fox ever good or did they just have a few gems here and there?
[1:26:46] <@Solidus_113> Didn't the famicom also have some kind of internet applications
[1:26:51] <leomuratore> @KyoryUtchy That's crazy. The franchis has such potential
[1:26:55] <+skyheys> @canadiananimatorguy It is, Sayonara was PSP, Shun was PS1
[1:27:14] <@Menitta> Yeah but Galaxy HD looks fuckin good
[1:27:17] <%Darmanimon> @Solidus_113 it was able to receive games that were satelite broadcasted to it.
[1:27:18] <ggbhtg> o p i n i o n s
[1:27:19] <+skyheys> HE RIGHT
[1:27:21] <Ryan1016> You can wiimote on dolphin
[1:27:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> Let EA make Star Fox: Squadrons

[1:27:25] <%Prevot> he's not wrong
[1:27:26] <overkrustice> Does Woolie actually regularly study Japanese?
[1:27:27] <@Menitta> Plus playing it with a Pro controller is ideal
[1:27:27] <ggbhtg> 5x Native Resolution in DOLPHIN tho

[1:27:44] <+Aeoneth> @DianaTheAscian It has like a 50% success rate. But the successes are SO good it feels like a 75% rate
[1:27:46] <KnivesEve> thats not an opinion its a fact
[1:27:49] <ggbhtg> Heck, 6x Native Resolution in DOLPHIN tho
[1:27:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> MUH WIIMOTE WAGGLAN

[1:27:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I a nice normal controller in my hans thank you
[1:27:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @skyheys The thing that was throwing me off was you couldn't swing to build momentum. You have the one shot and then after that you just dangle there
[1:27:59] <DianaTheAscian> @Aeoneth k

[1:36:31] <ggbhtg> The game that Nintendo REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE

[2:11:59] <jerkhov_> They read chat, just not direct acknowledgement in gameplay
[2:12:07] <+guynormus69> LUL
[2:12:14] <%KyoryUtchy> IIRC enemies give different rewards depending on how you kill them. Stomping on them gives you a coin, spinning/any other method gives you star bits.
[2:12:17] <ggbhtg> @jerkhov_ Yes, I have also been in a Woolie chat before
[2:12:20] <townzzzzz> one day they'll get yoshi
[2:12:27] <%gatorafan> Summon METEOR
[2:12:34] <DaKnightWarrior> Yoshi: HEEEEEELP!
[2:12:38] <%ringabal> Some say Yoshi is trapped in that egg to this day...
[2:12:39] <+lojack69> I get his mentality of exploring your options before doing the obvious, but this entire area is meant to be a yoshi playground
[2:12:40] <CursedNobleman> reminder that woolie apparently beat celeste
[2:12:42] <%chiluzza> its like the forums of any MMO
[2:12:44] <ggbhtg> If only they knew they could be riding Yoshi RIGHT NOW....

[2:13:13] <bigshedman> Remember Woolie, spinning cancels your momentum and will let you go a different direction.
[2:13:14] <dreadedcthulhu> ooo sax? did you mean jazz?
[2:13:16] <CursedNobleman> that was pretty deft, if accidental

[2:15:17] <%Josef_Stryker> Is this Woolie's first time playing Galaxy 2?
[2:15:18] <@Menitta> I want Yoshi to talk like a pokemon or like a text to speech in Terminal Montage

[2:15:26] <+guynormus69> @chaos_kun mama luigi
[2:15:29] <%RyTYoung> Can we at least get Danny Devito to voice a Yoshi in the Mario movie?
[2:15:35] <+skyheys> Sonic Adventure mecha rules, basically
[2:15:36] <%Prevot> smooch
[2:15:39] <missingangle> I mean, if he had a voice, just give him VIOLENCE's voice
[2:15:42] <jerkhov_> Understanding Yoshi speech requires high insight

[2:15:50] <dizimous> I bet all Yoshi sound like Yuri Lowenthal when they speak
[2:15:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Honestly the whole tongue pointer mechanic might be the reason this wasn't in the 3D collection
[2:16:07] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmm
[2:16:11] <CursedNobleman> LUL

[2:16:21] <%RyTYoung> @dizimous and they all introduce themselves as "Hi, my name is Peter Parker .."
[2:16:21] <@Menitta> I doubt it because the pointer on gyro works incredibly well in Galaxy HD
[2:16:25] <jerkhov_> 3D collection had gyro pointing

[2:16:44] <@Menitta> Honestly Galaxy on Switch is the definitive way to play that game
[2:16:47] <Chaos_kun> Do you think yoshi’s digestive tract is all jacked up from farting out so many star bits?
[2:16:49] <+guynormus69> you can sacrifice the joshi
[2:17:00] <+CuppaKofe> yeah, the gyro pointing is fine, no reason it couldn't have been used with Yoshi for the 3D collection
[2:17:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Where eggs come from
[2:17:05] <ggbhtg> if a yosh was lost
[2:17:06] <NekoUrabe> yoshi spawn nest

[2:17:47] <%Prevot> there's not enough games to do another collection
[2:17:53] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:17:57] <@Menitta> If I were to guess, I think they just wanted to put somnething out this year and they didnt have enough time for 2
[2:17:59] <+jiggy_snipe> they left it out cuz it's 2 Kappa
[2:18:01] <RamenRiderZ> Theyll come up with something
[2:18:02] <ggbhtg> time until EGG, chat?

[2:20:12] <%ringabal> So Reggie gets to play as Harvest and Echoes Act 3
[2:20:13] <SomersaultJustice> it's gooper blooper all over again
[2:20:14] <%Solidnick18> sort of
[2:20:16] <+CuppaKofe> Galaxy 2 as a bonus with 3D World would be aces, but I think Nintendo is just gonna straight up not bother porting it ever
[2:20:19] <+Exicuren> That's because Yoshi dreads th inevitable moment when Mario will habe to sacrifice him in a cliff to jump 2 inches higher
[2:20:23] <ggbhtg> @ringabal AND The World
[2:20:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> @ramenriderz thats 3d WORLD. 3d land is the 3ds vame
[2:20:27] <Saltmeisterr> @RamenRiderZ thats 3d world
[2:20:27] <andre11dr> MUST HUNT ALL

[2:20:29] <+Exicuren> have*
[2:20:33] <Carlioo> I mean mario just seems like a bad guy when you put it that way
[2:20:38] <CursedNobleman> 3d land is also pretty good*
[2:20:39] <Slim_Lipid> Not tongue comboing DansGame
[2:20:39] <@Menitta> I think thats why they're delisting 3D All Stars come March
[2:20:43] <@Menitta> they'll put it back up with 2
[2:20:47] <SomersaultJustice> he's a grappling hook now
[2:20:49] <@Menitta> Raw guessing tho
[2:20:53] <velgaduere> Reggie very busy pointing at things that aren't helping Woolie lmao

[2:20:57] <RamenRiderZ> Good ol Nintendo and the game naming
[2:20:58] <+Hawk_Rush> They should just have it as a downloadable content

[2:21:04] <ggbhtg> Collusion star
[2:21:05] <%Prevot> SAME color huh
[2:21:05] <+Hawk_Rush> instead of delisting it
[2:21:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> 3d land pretty impressed me for a handheld game. I think I like 3d world more overall tho
[2:21:22] <+Slybluedemon> I think they are going to delist it and just put the games up separately on the store
[2:21:32] <%Prevot> ^
[2:21:33] <dreadedcthulhu> H E L I X
[2:21:34] <@Menitta> 3D Land is a killer app for 3DS
[2:21:35] <+CuppaKofe> @Menitta Honestly I have a feeling they are gonna just sell them all separately for like 20$ after March.
[2:21:47] <@Menitta> maybe
[2:21:50] <%Prevot> we'll be lucky if they're only $20
[2:21:50] <NekoUrabe> Praise it
[2:21:50] <CursedNobleman> id buy galaxy at 20. im not keen on trying sunshine or 64 tho
[2:22:02] <@Menitta> I mean they sell 64 for $10 on Wii U
[2:22:03] <ggbhtg> obviously Nintendo has our best interests and frugal-ness in mind Kappa
[2:22:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> didn't they delist Pikmin 3 after announcing the switch port or was that some bullshit I read?
[2:22:18] <+CuppaKofe> 64 is a bad port, but Sunshine isn't a terrible port .
[2:22:24] <+Hawk_Rush> Why would they sell an N64 game or $20?
[2:22:32] <ggbhtg> how is 64 a bad port?
[2:22:34] <@Menitta> oh my god automod lmao
[2:22:39] <+Hawk_Rush> thanks automod lmao
[2:22:40] <Saltmeisterr> all i seen of sunshine is that is a jank mess

[2:26:56] <ggbhtg> The game will not tell you about this move, it's a secret: Mid Air Spin + Ground Pound = Sonic Homing Attack @WoolieVersus
[2:26:57] <pixel_river> SourPls
[2:27:02] <EddieDalmunda> These are gold stars, the old ones were shiny yellow clearly.
[2:27:04] <SomersaultJustice> and he didn't get permission, so he's an illegal alien
[2:27:08] <nxflre> is this a full LP? or just a one and done?

[2:27:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> looks like a full LP
[2:27:20] <dizimous> No taxes on this planet
[2:27:32] <Darren716> Yeah on the nose
[2:27:41] <cero_5> also spin into long jump is basically a tatsu
[2:27:45] <ggbhtg> and I surrrre hope you can do it while on Yoshi, or that'd be bad game design
[2:27:45] <ShiningAxis> homing attack is a bit of an exaggeration
[2:27:48] <Darren716> you can get it next time
[2:27:59] <%Josef_Stryker> After all this time, I think this game still looks great graphically
[2:28:05] <%chiluzza> the big mario watches its spawn infest other galaxies
[2:28:13] <Saltmeisterr> yeah this game holds up really well
[2:28:25] <CursedNobleman> cartoon graphics age great, take wind waker for example
[2:28:34] <DaKnightWarrior> @josef_stryker yep. it still looks amazing.

[2:46:19] <%KyoryUtchy> Gonna tell you right now, your gonna need A LOT of Star Bits. Reggie might want to ease up on his trigger finger; Star Bits aren't just ammo, they're CURRENCY.
[2:46:21] <velgaduere> stylish kills? outside of Paper Mario?! it's more likely than you think
[2:46:24] <Winner_92> reggie giving big luma a hug

[2:48:25] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> LUL
[2:48:29] <+CuppaKofe> shooting starbits is pointless when you can just waggle in front of the enemy, which does the same thing pretty much. It's straight up a waste of starbits.

[2:49:48] <DaKnightWarrior> Mario is OP.
[2:49:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> But thats just a theory
[2:49:55] <@Menitta> Having earth-like gravity to these small planets would implode the instant they'd come into existence

[2:50:46] <dabeaminator> He does know that the spin is an attack, right?
[2:50:52] <+astrofizzix> Yeah, these planetoids would need to be as dense as a neutron star to have this strong of a gravitational pull.
[2:51:03] <@akuda_bar> just pretend mario weighs almost nothing
[2:51:10] <CursedNobleman> @dabeaminator dunno, i guess hes been relying on reggie to do the fighting

[3:26:03] <+agent_numa_lol> mario 64 on the ds was how i experienced it, so i get it
[3:26:05] <ggbhtg> Imagine not having disposable income Kappa
[3:26:10] <@Solidus_113> the normieville of the FGC
[3:26:13] <@akuda_bar> reggie's stand... surface
[3:26:18] <%gnoame> Get Reggie to play No More Heroes for some real fun gameplay
[3:26:23] <+jiggy_snipe> yes the smash normie ville Kappa
[3:26:24] <%KyoryUtchy> Sorry, they're just for show. Powerups are level specific, if you were able to bring stuff like Yoshi or Cloud Mario into any level that would trivialize a good chunk of the game.
[3:26:26] <%Solidnick18> reggie is coming in from the streets
[3:26:35] <ggbhtg> Reggie VS Super Mario 3D All Stars
[3:26:37] <SomersaultJustice> the normie that played ff6 Kappa
[3:26:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:26:53] <%Lion_kun> Reggie didnt come from retail.
[3:26:59] <NekoUrabe> Better than the million halo games in a row xD
[3:27:01] <TheFramedWarlock> I love Mario Galaxy ! Just a fun time all around
[3:27:01] <%Terrarp> Reggie is too pure, must be protected
[3:27:02] <%koolaid_kevster> how can reggie be an avid smash player and not know the main character
[3:27:14] <+Estuko> I was never really that curious in the game, but watching you guys hang out nad play games together or just side by side has always been a super fun deal. Always looking forward to more!
[3:27:17] <Darren716> Hmm i wouldnt say 2 is better, it's like a .1 point lesser than 1
[3:27:20] <+cdrom321> Way better co-op. Reggie is a Luma instead of just a cursor.
[3:27:41] <ExpressNode> Isn't Odyssey somewhat a Galaxy 3?
[3:27:42] <+jiggy_snipe> it was a throwback
[3:27:44] <rcand9> galaxy 1 is almost a perfect game
[3:27:45] <@Solidus_113> Only 3D sequel?
[3:27:56] <+manwhoisputty> galaxy 2 is one of my favorite games of all time
[3:27:57] <Warbot40> Both Galaxy games are kinda underwhelming for me sadly. Still very good but I think I just prefer Sandbox 3D Mario.
[3:27:58] <DSD24> Everyone is hot in Hades
[3:28:08] <Darren716> Not a fan of how galaxy 2 does it's levels, they're all small in terms of how many levels there are
[3:28:27] <+CuppaKofe> 3D World is technically a direct sequel to 3D Land
[3:28:41] <+Mahbonk> It's been pretty good in Early Acces indeed. First game i ever double dipped in a while
[3:28:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Early access is the worst
[3:28:46] <%RyTYoung> I hit credits on Hades on Switch, such a good game
[3:28:53] <+Mahbonk> sadly Switch doesn't have save transfer for now
[3:29:07] <+CuppaKofe> Oh shit, Hadesis on Switch? I need to get on that.
[3:29:12] <BlackermanZX> YESSS
[3:29:15] <%RyTYoung> @mahbonk but they're adding it aren't they?
[3:29:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> True
[3:29:18] <@Menitta> I am so fucking excited for Kirby Fighters 2
[3:29:24] <%Solidnick18> fighting games tonight are great
[3:29:27] <dizimous> oh shit?

[3:29:36] <+Mahbonk> it runs well on Switch aside from a few slow downs when lots of shit happens on screen.Good port
[3:29:38] <%RyTYoung> @cuppakofe it runs pretty well on Switch, definitely play in docked mode
