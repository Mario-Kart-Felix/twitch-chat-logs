[0:11:41] <munitalprats> if you meant realism and dual wielding there have been people who dual wielded, mainly rapiers and parrying daggers
[0:12:01] <+xemnahort> @buttstuff_n_coffeepots don’t quote me on this but lore wise I think the guy who perfected the dual sword style was around the nobunaga era
[0:12:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Back to back duels PogChamp
[0:12:26] <alexandrecau> those ronin knows where to stand for a duel

[0:13:22] <%Rosewater_444> and he can float
[0:13:23] <alexandrecau> He stole it
[0:13:24] <munitalprats> samurai were primarily archers iirc
[0:13:32] <%artificerjoni> @xemnahort Hold on, If you're thinking Miyamoto Musashi wasn't he alive during the Edo periodi?
[0:13:42] <+xemnahort> Roses are red, food is delectable, your lack of honor is easily detectable
[0:13:43] <%OldManJEWc> please tell me this his first duel with the straw hats
[0:13:54] <%doomerskeletor13> I love how he pops the sword, reminds me of Vergil in DMC5
[0:13:56] <+frog_lore> @OldManJEWc his 2nd
[0:14:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @oldmanjewc His second, he just did the first like a minute ago
[0:14:09] <%Rosewater_444> He did some offscreen no?
[0:14:10] <kenny_biff> I wish we could get the dyes for the ronin/kensei outfit that these duelists have. they seem unique
[0:14:16] <%OldManJEWc> damn
[0:14:20] <+xemnahort> @artificerjoni I don’t remember the specifics and all I know was from nioh 2 so I may be getting the timeline wrong

[0:27:25] <%bread_assassin> What bonus does Woolie have that gives you the ability to revive with 2 resolve instead of 3?
[0:27:38] <+xemnahort> It’s always been 2 resolve
[0:27:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @bread_assassin it's always been 2

[0:29:23] <%ChoculaUltra> Skully legit got impregnated by aliens at one point and still was skeptical LUL
[0:29:38] <%bread_assassin> Playing the game myself right now, and I can confirm on Hard mode it IS three resolve for a revive.

[2:11:19] <alexandrecau> Noble thief
[2:12:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo how cool is it to find an armor and when you wear it the ghost says "you aight here's my power"
[2:12:50] <%DSD24> They probably don't know his name
[2:12:57] <%Irridium> maybe if the other guy didn't want his armor stolen he shouldn't have died
[2:13:03] <alexandrecau> Ghost said it was cool
[2:13:06] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s his armor because SHUT HP
[2:13:18] <+BottledLineArt> The spirit called out to him before he took it, so the implication is that the spirit wanted someone to take the armor.
[2:13:20] <theCoolChild> It's Gosaku's armor cause he was able to steal it
[2:13:48] <%Jack8274> I would do Yuna's
[2:13:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you need the keys before finding the door
[2:14:03] <BlackermanZX> finders keppers
[2:14:06] <CarmineJP> I still prefer the Sakai armor vs the Gosaku armor.

[3:13:00] <+jiggy_snipe> she's in the wrong
[3:13:00] <RamenRiderZ> Ishikawa's talking mad shit in the Dance of Wrath range
[3:13:04] <%doomerskeletor13> I can’t imagine why Tomoe joined the mongols when she has such a stand up guy as a teacher
[3:13:09] <+jiggy_snipe> what's the difference between her and Ryuzo?
[3:13:12] <alexandrecau> She did nothing wrong except use people as target vractice for fun
[3:13:14] <%CptnCampy61> Nah she’s left bodies in streets
[3:13:23] <MichaelDood> Only Ishikawa could push someone to this
[3:13:30] <+cvp5127> shes morally grey
[3:13:35] <%doomerskeletor13> @jiggy_snipe Ishikawa doesn’t like her, that makes her cool by default
[3:13:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cvp5127 indeed
[3:13:51] <$razielhex> MASTER of the BOW
[3:14:07] <%CptnCampy61> Heads for target practice
[3:14:09] <+gnoame> Bang Tomoe and give her a kid, then teach that kid to be a better archer than Ishiwaka, should be set at 3 months old.
[3:14:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ishikawa "bow's don't kill people"
[3:14:35] <RamenRiderZ> the arrows do huehue
[3:15:00] <$razielhex> "I'm not mad, I'm disappointed Tomoe"
[3:15:15] <RamenRiderZ> "Betray me I dare you"
[3:15:17] <+Chronobot> What are you gonna do bitch, KILL EM ALL
[3:15:23] <+OroOreo> ratatouille YOU DONT HAVE THE GUTS
[3:15:25] <RamenRiderZ> "Wtf why did you betray me"
[3:15:27] <+MugenSandan> Tomoe you didn't shoot that baby HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING
[3:15:29] <%Irridium> "What are you gonna do, betray me?!"
[3:15:30] <%doomerskeletor13> “What are you gonna do, kill someone?”
[3:15:31] <alexandrecau> Can't even kill innocent you a bitch tomoe
[3:15:36] <%Jack8274> Take this bow, go down to the west side 3 am...
[3:15:55] <+Chronobot> *Bicycle meme guy* Fuckin tomoe
[3:16:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WILL THEY
[3:16:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Literally the only two students that Ishikawa has had have turned into murderers, that’s NOT a coincidence LUL
[3:16:32] <+MugenSandan> I gotta ask what is SO AMAZING about Japanese archery that they gotta keep Mongolians from stealing it
[3:17:05] <$razielhex> Mongolians used short-bows; smaller and less ranged
[3:17:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:17:15] <$razielhex> Japanese bows were like two meters long
[3:17:26] <RamenRiderZ> It's a good thing the Mongol archers dont ride horses :)
[3:17:27] <%Jack8274> POG
[3:17:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RamenRiderZ man that would make them extremely effective, i sure am glad they don't though
[3:17:52] <+gnoame> pretty sure that was an enemy archer, not ishikawa
[3:18:01] <+MugenSandan> I mean I get that but the game acts like Japanese archers can do sick DMC bow juggles
[3:18:40] <Tsunamidusher> They do in this game if you go to the wrong neighborhood LUL
[3:18:46] <%rottingpastry> The concept that Mongols needed help with archery is laughable at best, but who cares it's a good game.
[3:18:51] <%Livelinne> shiaLUL shiaLUL shiaLUL
[3:18:59] <+vaderxyz1970> I miss Marco Polo for that intro
[3:19:08] <alexandrecau> IT's not that they need help it's that they love learning new archery trick
[3:19:13] <%Livelinne> grannClown
[3:19:44] <alexandrecau> Ishikawa does not want his way to be taught to the enemy because that's like your enemy doing your moveset, it pisses you off
[3:19:49] <+DJ_Omen> this playthru has no honour!
[3:19:58] <%Jack8274> Sure thing buddt

[3:20:14] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[3:20:18] <$razielhex> the whole thing is intense Japanese Historical Revisionism
[3:20:34] <penitentpentwitch> "Where's that BETRAYAL Button?"
[3:20:35] <+MugenSandan> oh I don't care about the concept I just find it hilarious how much they act like Japanese archery is hypest shit and I start to imagine dumb shit
[3:20:43] <$razielhex> there weren't even Katanas, or Bushido at this time
[3:20:52] <+MugenSandan> "Yo man Japanese archery is PLUS ON BLOCK"
[3:20:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Good session lads
[3:20:57] <%Jack8274> woolieMINHMAX woolieKICKDAD woolieSPICE
[3:20:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aaah yarikawa next week then, shit's gonna be great
[3:21:02] <NeroInfinite> There wasn't?
[3:21:02] <+gnoame> swipe down to spit at feet
[3:21:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this one was also good, loved the bear stand
[3:21:32] <%doomerskeletor13> I love Kenji
[3:21:52] <NeroInfinite> I swear there was katanasby the time mongols invaded..since katana is just swords.
[3:22:53] <$razielhex> The progenitor to Bushido was in the 17th century, but it wasn't codified until 1899. The Japanese nobility mythologized it and retroactively applied it to themselves historically.
[3:23:25] <penitentpentwitch> FEAR or Dead Space?
