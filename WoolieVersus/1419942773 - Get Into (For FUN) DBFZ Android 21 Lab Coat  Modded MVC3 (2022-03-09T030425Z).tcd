[0:02:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> if dbfz gets rollback this game is immortal
[0:02:03] <Aussie_Manny> God, I hope it gets rollback... doodSad
[0:02:05] <leith_aziz> Rev 2 will always be my priority, but I can sympathise
[0:02:10] <leith_aziz> TPFufun
[0:02:14] <miucsa51> Harada...
[0:02:21] <%SerpentScintilla> hey woolie, beat elden ring today using an int build, its good :)
[0:02:27] <Aussie_Manny> Why the FRIG did Cross Tag Battle get rollback before THIS?? doodBait
[0:02:28] <+Jiggisnipe> but the community would be so happy tho
[0:02:28] <+gpallas> If it got rollback, it's user base would skyrocket
[0:02:29] <%ChillaxingJay> yes
[0:02:36] <+samuraiknack> Yo but When Cruz Brothers?
[0:02:39] <DrkJP520> i would install it. that's an improvement
[0:02:41] <+Jiggisnipe> I want every FG community to get the good stuff
[0:02:45] <+OrangeMDT> Rollback and costumes would be big money, dunno why Bandai doesn‚Äôt see that
[0:02:57] <+acbadgers> u think they gunna let db figtherz 2 to happen soon so maybe just maybe rollback higher chance
[0:03:09] <leith_aziz> @Aussie_Manny Likely because a group of modders already were working on BBCF rollback, and BB Tag shares assets with CF
[0:03:24] <leith_aziz> That also likely helped with P4AU getting rollback
[0:03:27] <%townzzzzz> dragonball fighterz strive
[0:03:34] <+acbadgers> lol
[0:03:42] <edgeyberzerker> 5 raiders from edgeyberzerker have joined!

[0:03:51] <DSD24> Always could go for more Baiken
[0:03:54] <leith_aziz> I wouldnt mind giving P4AU a shot when it gets rollback
[0:04:15] <DSD24> The best 21 design
[0:04:22] <leith_aziz> Rev 2 rollback would be the dream for me. Of course, that's gonna be a long period of waiting TPFufun
[0:04:40] <%ekodrop> what?

[0:09:28] <FrostedZaibatsu> I mean you can make a 3D model of you guys. Thats it
[0:09:29] <+Javaa01> The only way to escape this reality is for Reggie to become grossly incandescent

[0:16:35] <@Solidus_113> Majin design is better, but I don't care for the function
[0:16:46] <Aussie_Manny> I was hoping for Good Majin #21, actually.
[0:16:49] <xxHungryxx> Hey chat, how good is Piccolo in this?
[0:16:57] <DSD24> Man if I'm a coward for liking classy ladies in lab coats then call me a coward
[0:17:02] <leith_aziz> Arcsys games' presentation being top tier as usual pickyEZ
[0:17:05] <%kewlmyc> Both are good all jokes aside
[0:17:08] <%DkLordG> Majin is a good design, I just REALLY like glasses
[0:17:26] <jasonisgold79> I like both designs, but I won't deny the Human version just does it a bit more. She just looks cool and sexy.
[0:17:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay this game is stupidly loud
[0:17:37] <KnivesEve> how bout Majin with glasses
[0:18:00] <%DkLordG> @kniveseve you have my attention woolieSMUG
[0:18:49] <Aussie_Manny> These boots are made for stompin'

[0:19:27] <%DkLordG> about to see The Batman, y'all have a good time
[0:19:28] <jasonisgold79> God I hope this game either gets a sequel or like an upgrade version that has all the current dlc, tweaks to certain characters and mechanics, ports to modern consoles, and of course online improvement.
[0:19:47] <ssulcer> @OrangeMDT saibamen
[0:19:51] <mothdude> The Grab
[0:19:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> THIS MOVE
[0:19:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> IS SO FUCKED
[0:19:56] <jasonisgold79> Like ya know how Street Fighter had 4 Ultra and 5 Arcade? Basically that.
[0:19:58] <%ChillaxingJay> PogChamp
[0:19:59] <odd_slater> ^^^
[0:20:01] <Aussie_Manny> Command grab super
[0:20:03] <Aussie_Manny> man
[0:20:07] <odd_slater> It's a wild move
[0:20:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> comand grab level 1 that buffs and debuffs for the entire rest of the match
[0:20:28] <jasonisgold79> Oh yeah, isn't she the only new character with a command grab super or something?
[0:20:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> she's the only one tmk with a level 1 command grab super
[0:21:17] <Aussie_Manny> Good air combo.
[0:21:18] <jasonisgold79> Yeah I remember seeing someone going crazy over that.
[0:21:29] <ssulcer> @jasonisgold79 i mean technically cooler's level 3 has a command grab variant lol
[0:21:37] <jasonisgold79> That is true.
[0:21:59] <ssulcer> its a bit disingenuous to call it a command grab though it doesnt hit crouchers
[0:21:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:31] <leith_aziz> I can relate to autopiloting pickyAYAYA
[0:22:35] <jasonisgold79> I guess cause it's a level one and a command grab, you could really abuse it? I mean unless a players keep away game is on fricking point, it seems pretty easy to get up close.
[0:22:36] <leith_aziz> Happens to all of us
[0:22:37] <ssulcer> might as well say all the counter supers are command grabs just because thats how they "function" in game terms
[0:23:07] <jasonisgold79> And since it's a level 1, I'd imagine it's input must be pretty simple as well. Like is just the standard quarter circle?
[0:23:25] <Wahrow> AI Woolie would do it first try
[0:23:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah
[0:23:31] <ssulcer> @jasonisgold79 yeah i mean its a for real mix up tool, its basically the same as the old ex moves which were 1 bar
[0:23:56] <leith_aziz> If the grab is a super, it's still a command grab. You're not changing the properties, use of meter doesnt change that cohhNotes
[0:23:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but this level 1 is fast as shit and buffs your 21 and debuffs your enemy
[0:24:48] <+durgunn> im sorry are we trying to argue that 21's lvl 1 isnt broken?
[0:25:30] <Carlioo> I'm just surprised lab 21 wasn't playable already
[0:25:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> i wouldn't call it broken just stupidly good.
[0:25:47] <%notsoy> it persisting even after she dies is wild
[0:25:51] <+gpallas> Man, twitch (and only twitch) is constantly shitting itself for me... Have fun today guys ^^
[0:26:10] <+durgunn> 21% damage nerf for the rest of the match that you can confirm into off of a BnB sounds pretty busted to me
[0:26:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah it's being a bit fucky
[0:26:19] <leith_aziz> I see chat still cares about meta or semblance of balance. Cant say I care much personally. It's a never ending cycle of discussion cohhHmm
[0:26:44] <%ChillaxingJay> yo
[0:26:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, you can combo into ssj4 gogeta super buff too

[0:54:12] <Aussie_Manny> I assume that command grab by Good #21 doesn't absorb powers like Majin #21, and it's just an attack.
[0:54:23] <leith_aziz> The purple and green is a nice blend of colors
[0:54:30] <mothdude> Lab Coat 21's command grab does heal some health though
[0:54:34] <+Tamarrow> @Aussie_Manny it heals 500 damage

[1:36:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Yeah but like, don't he got her genetics?
[1:36:21] <+TopTieramisu> and none of her work ethic
[1:36:40] <+TopTieramisu> joseph loves shortcuts and easy ways out
[1:36:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> don't work harder work smarter
[1:37:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> Joseph's motto
[1:37:18] <Heefnoff> Are they gonna use Parsec for this?
[1:37:21] <+TopTieramisu> it is what makes him the most fun jojo
[1:37:26] <+TopTieramisu> so i'm not complaining
[1:37:27] <mothdude> Josephs two least favorite phrases are Hard Word and Work Hard

[1:38:23] <%ChillaxingJay> Heefnoff i think it might just be locals
[1:38:24] <Aussie_Manny> COUPLE KICK

[1:39:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> dababy?
[1:39:56] <%kewlmyc> Is Baby the only liked GT villain?
[1:39:59] <Aussie_Manny> Vegito!
[1:40:02] <Heefnoff> Yes @kewlmyc
[1:40:08] <+Ricky_Rexx> @kewlmyc only good one anyways
[1:40:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[1:40:08] <+TopTieramisu> baby cheated because he's in vegeta's body
[1:40:09] <mothdude> Vegito rules
[1:40:20] <lategshi> daddy mommy and baby?
[1:40:25] <leith_aziz> @kewlmyc Im not in touch with teh community, but I see people asking for Omega Shenron, sooo...
[1:40:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> dababy
[1:40:32] <+TopTieramisu> people liked the concept of the shadow dragons
[1:40:34] <Heefnoff> Oh shit Woolie is playing Marvel after this
[1:40:35] <Aussie_Manny> Time to go to work and make the donuts.
[1:40:41] <%kewlmyc> I thought the dragons were neat villains. The concept behind them was cool at least
[1:40:46] <mothdude> Omega Shenron is a nothing villain but he had some cool moves
[1:40:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Heefnoff Time for broken Vergil mods LUL'
[1:40:50] <Heefnoff> Both of my favorite fighting games today, bless
[1:40:56] <+Ricky_Rexx> "Damn we never got Bojack in this game?" some bojack horseman fans idk
[1:40:57] <+TopTieramisu> GT: good ideas, bad execution
[1:41:07] <Heefnoff> I‚Äôm pretty familiar with the mods lol, glad to see him checking out Vergil @th3smartalec
[1:41:12] <Aussie_Manny> I recall in Friday Night Fisticuffs, Woolie had #16, Teen Gohan, Cell, Kid Buu, maybe a couple others.
[1:41:12] <Qsmash_> Nuova Shenron was cool
[1:41:14] <+TopTieramisu> i even like the idea of goku going on an space roadtrip with trunks and pan
[1:41:17] <+TopTieramisu> but well...
[1:41:19] <Heefnoff> DMC5 Vergil is like, EXTREMELY technical
[1:41:23] <+TopTieramisu> pan just became a maiden in distress
[1:41:46] <%kewlmyc> Pan is about to do more in the new movie than she ever did in GT LUL
[1:41:55] <+TopTieramisu> pan looks OP as hell in super
[1:42:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> come on fighterz, when turles?
[1:42:19] <Aussie_Manny> Similar to Goku Black. A villain controlling the body of a saiyan.
[1:42:19] <leith_aziz> Oh Vegito, so many matches were you've pissed me off cohhSuffer
[1:42:25] <%SirGO0SE> truly i cant believe its 2022 and we're still getting new dragon ball shit
[1:42:28] <+TopTieramisu> baby pan looks like she can take out saiyan saga frieza
[1:42:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> ZweihanderSteve subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:42:30] <+TopTieramisu> vegeta*
[1:42:33] <leith_aziz> Superdash into spam Jump S
[1:42:40] <leith_aziz> That or stagger with L
[1:42:49] <Heefnoff> The FighterZ roster is so good tbh
[1:42:56] <Heefnoff> Not really any huge omissions
[1:43:04] <Aussie_Manny> HIT'S EVERYWHERE
[1:43:07] <Mach5Mike> Raditz tho
[1:43:14] <Aussie_Manny> HE'S HERE, HE'S THERE
[1:43:14] <+TopTieramisu> i wish there were a few more human characters
[1:43:17] <+Ricky_Rexx> when dodoria?
[1:43:19] <%kewlmyc> The love for Raditz will always baffle me
[1:43:22] <Mach5Mike> Also no Hercule
[1:43:25] <Heefnoff> Raditz I could see, but like there‚Äôs just not a lot of material for him
[1:43:34] <%SirGO0SE> i always wanted to see Pikkon in a game but know itll never happen
[1:43:35] <Heefnoff> Hercule I‚Äôd love as a joke character, surprised they never did it
[1:43:37] <%kewlmyc> Half his moves in games are made up and named after ice cream because he was a nothing character
[1:43:37] <+TopTieramisu> raditz is meh imo
[1:43:40] <DedlokPM> @Mach5Mike Raditz is so freaking out of his league at this point tho
[1:43:42] <Aussie_Manny> Oops, wrong ice move.
[1:43:44] <dmysta3000> It would have been cool to see Pikkon
[1:43:46] <+TopTieramisu> raditz made a big impact but he ended up being the santana of the saiyans
[1:43:51] <mothdude> Only persons left I want is Toppo. He was fun in Super.
[1:44:06] <Heefnoff> Yeah, literally the only things I‚Äôd want from this point are Super characters
[1:44:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> I wanted toppo too tbh
[1:44:11] <%kewlmyc> ALL Raditz has is being Goku's brother. And even Goku doesn't give a fuck about that.
[1:44:13] <Mach5Mike> @DedlokPM Didn't stop them from including Nappa though
[1:44:15] <leith_aziz> I love how Vegito's tackle screams YEET! in my head
[1:44:17] <Aussie_Manny> I assume we are finally done with DBFZ characters, but if there IS any more... I want Uub.
[1:44:17] <Heefnoff> Maybe First Form Cell
[1:44:27] <DedlokPM> @Mach5Mike Nappa was stronger than Raditz tho
[1:44:29] <+TopTieramisu> uub is a real blank slate
[1:44:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> only characters i want to see in DBF is an oolong/puar/yajirobi 3 in one woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:44:45] <+TopTieramisu> yajirobe would be a dope
[1:44:48] <+Jessie_Lockhart> That super reminds me of Leona
[1:44:54] <+TopTieramisu> tekken bob with a sword
[1:45:00] <mothdude> Nappa works because they added his Saibamen summoning mechanic.
[1:45:01] <%kewlmyc> Nappa merc'd most of the Z team.
[1:45:04] <leith_aziz> I have no idea what the future holds for DBFZ cohhHmm
[1:45:07] <%SirGO0SE> Heles (universe 2 GoD) please debugYes
[1:45:15] <+TopTieramisu> and nappa has the iconic mouth laser
[1:45:30] <+elderpunch> i want pikkon for dbfz
[1:45:52] <leith_aziz> That bastard called me DEADWEIGHT!
[1:45:57] <leith_aziz> pickyAngy
[1:46:14] <+TopTieramisu> vegeta gonna unlock his devil trigger
[1:46:26] <Heefnoff> Really hoping someone makes a Nero mod for UMVC3
[1:46:32] <%kewlmyc> But yeah, I can't think of any character except maybe Hercule that is a glowing emission from this roster.
[1:46:33] <Heefnoff> Or at least more Dante mods
[1:46:37] <leith_aziz> Well, Broly is voiced by JYB cohhHmm
[1:46:42] <Heefnoff> I‚Äôd agree with that @kewlmyc
[1:46:43] <Aussie_Manny> oooh, nice counter!
[1:46:53] <+TopTieramisu> broly is in permanent devil trigger
[1:47:06] <Heefnoff> Broly‚Äôs Devil trigger is taking off his armor
[1:47:11] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, you can hold the ice, and when you let go, it activates.

[1:48:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Do it for the content Reggie doodGood
[1:48:16] <+elderpunch> or*
[1:48:22] <+TopTieramisu> gogeta
[1:48:23] <DSD24> Vegito has the better outfit
[1:48:32] <forumbug74> fun fact: android 16 is modeled after Gero's son
[1:48:34] <+TopTieramisu> in super, gogeta is way cooler
[1:48:37] <DSD24> Plus I like how cocky Vegito is
[1:48:42] <leith_aziz> The person I see that gets the job done is Gogeta pickyThink
[1:49:01] <Aussie_Manny> DUNKED
[1:49:03] <+TopTieramisu> vegito jobbed in the zamasu arc while gogeta styled on broly
[1:49:06] <forumbug74> Gogeta is the only fusion that wins his fights lol
[1:49:22] <Mach5Mike> Gogeta Blue to be specific, ended a fight without messing around or running out of fusion time
[1:49:31] <leith_aziz> Come on and SLAM!
[1:49:45] <%SirGO0SE> yeah Vegito's stronger but he's mentally an idiot and always fucks them LUL
[1:49:55] <+TopTieramisu> vegito inherited vegeta's winrate while gogeta inherited goku's
[1:49:57] <DedlokPM> THIS IS THE STANCE pixcatFight Û†ÄÄ
[1:50:06] <%kewlmyc> \_\_O
[1:50:09] <+TopTieramisu> i wouldn't even say vegito's stronger in super
[1:50:10] <+nochejunior> super gogeta beat Janemba i believe
[1:50:19] <leith_aziz> Hit Vs Hit
[1:50:20] <forumbug74> as soon as Gogeta went blue Broly never touched him again
[1:50:29] <leith_aziz> Time To Make The Donuts
[1:50:40] <Heefnoff> The gun, it‚Äôs so good
[1:50:41] <BlackermanZX> and you can charge it right
[1:50:45] <Qsmash_> the cannon
[1:50:54] <Heefnoff> It‚Äôs not chargeable, it just uses all your meter
[1:50:54] <Aussie_Manny> Right, the R2 + quarter circle. Hold it down and it uses more bar.
[1:51:05] <Heefnoff> I thought it just uses all your bar automatically
[1:51:05] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, it's not chargable anymore?
[1:51:11] <leith_aziz> You cant charge it. It always takes all your bar for it
[1:51:32] <Aussie_Manny> Jeez, so it's just a cannon now then. No more charging's kind of a bummer.
[1:51:33] <DedlokPM> lytKILLGOKU lytDUNKED
[1:51:43] <BlackermanZX> everything is smooth till Hit pulls the glock
[1:51:45] <Aussie_Manny> I'mma double-check that...
[1:51:57] <+TopTieramisu> hit kinda has a ki gun
[1:52:03] <%Subtlevictory> reggie use the command  grab super more lol
[1:52:11] <+TopTieramisu> sniped goku and killed him instantly
[1:52:35] <Aussie_Manny> Yep, it consumes ALL of your meter. At 4 levels it becomes more damaging than Hit's level 3.
[1:52:39] <DSD24> This is the stance!
[1:52:42] <DedlokPM> THIS IS THE STANCE pixcatFight Û†ÄÄ
[1:52:43] <Aussie_Manny> O_/_/
[1:53:08] <Mach5Mike> Still wish Goku and Vegeta in SS Blue had their Ressurection F costumes in this game
[1:53:14] <Aussie_Manny> So if Hit gets to 4 bars, his gun is a stronger option than the Stance.

[1:57:04] <Qsmash_> Piccolo Amarilla in the new movie
[1:57:26] <+TopTieramisu> i'm not gonna lie, ultra ego does not seem equivalent to ultra instinct

[2:00:38] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu It's up to the publisher, so yes, it's Bamco
[2:00:50] <Aussie_Manny> It's rough.

[2:01:35] <BlackermanZX> netcode aint gonna change anytime soon
[2:01:36] <Heefnoff> I gotta let you know, a Trish mod came out
[2:01:43] <leith_aziz> I used to be a Wifi player untill I got a wire for Strive
[2:01:52] <Heefnoff> Not sure if you have it added to your game yet, it's a separate thing
[2:01:56] <Heefnoff> But it's worth checking out
[2:02:04] <$ggbhtg> Can confrim, the Tekken 7 stank hate is STILL on me
[2:02:07] <ExpressNode> So weird how the can add rollback to older games than DBZF
[2:02:08] <leith_aziz> Maybe we're past that point by now
[2:02:11] <Aussie_Manny> üì∂ doodStare
[2:02:14] <+JayCWayC> marvel's netcode was a hilarious joke.
[2:02:17] <+TopTieramisu> isn't trish already in marvel 3?
[2:02:23] <leith_aziz> Besides Bamco games, we're likely rollback as standard now
[2:02:26] <Heefnoff> It's meant to be Gloria from DMC4
[2:02:31] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I mean not everyone can run a who

[2:02:51] <DedlokPM> @TopTieramisu yeah. Most license holders have little to say about gameplay related stuff other than how their characters, stories, and image are depicted. Most of them don't care about the specifics and leave that up to dev and publisher

[2:03:18] <Shardlab> @ExpressNode I know. Bandai Namco is in charge of that game, so it's on them rather than Arcsys, who have seen the light and are implementing it into their games
[2:03:19] <Mach5Mike> Monster Hunter made MVCI so much fun, I hope she gets to be in another versus game
[2:03:20] <+TopTieramisu> nero has to be in the next marvel game
[2:03:23] <%notsoy> a while ago, they did
[2:03:24] <leith_aziz> @ExpressNode To be fair, those games were spriye based, and use less GPU and much less code-complex. older Arcsys 3D games dont have rollback in comparison
[2:03:29] <+TopTieramisu> if he's not then capcom doesn't know what they're doing
[2:03:30] <BlackermanZX> Oh +R is a spicy game
[2:03:32] <+Catpurnicus> You'll find out about the Hoontas when you start bloodborne  in 4 years

[2:03:58] <leith_aziz> I know some prefer +R, but weirdly enough it never jives with me. Which is weird because I love Xrd and Strive
[2:04:00] <Heefnoff> DMC5 Vergil legit just got updated a couple hours ago
[2:04:06] <Heefnoff> I assume it's mostly bug fixes though
[2:04:06] <+TopTieramisu> V would be very zato-one
[2:04:10] <+JayCWayC> I want jam back in strive. lytWIPED
[2:04:12] <leith_aziz> I cant tell why. It's the "feel" of it cohhHmm
[2:04:27] <Heefnoff> But yeah I'm very familiar with the mods out, did a little testing for STARS Jill
[2:04:30] <+cubbywolf> xrd is too good
[2:04:32] <Super_Voltekka> Original Guilty Gear wen
[2:04:39] <Heefnoff> (Idk if you have her installed but yeah she's pretty cool)

[2:04:50] <+TopTieramisu> think they'll update johnny's design?
[2:04:55] <Shardlab> Zato or Dormammu
[2:04:56] <leith_aziz> Rev 2, my favorite fighting game of all time cohhL
[2:04:56] <$ggbhtg> Vergil got patched hours ago, eh?
[2:05:03] <Heefnoff> I feel like his design is too strong to update @TopTieramisu
[2:05:07] <Heefnoff> But I'm sure they'll find a way
[2:05:10] <Heefnoff> @ggbhtg Apparently
[2:05:10] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu He already looks perfect
[2:05:12] <@Solidus_113> yeah you should download the vergil patch if you didn't
[2:05:13] <+TopTieramisu> maybe
[2:05:13] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:05:18] <+TopTieramisu> they were too scared to change baiken
[2:05:28] <%RyTYoung> THIS LOOKS WILD
[2:05:30] <DSD24> Thor theme
[2:05:31] <Heefnoff> The Vergil patch fixes a few things, one being a compatibility issue with DMC1 Dante
[2:05:33] <+cubbywolf> mahvel
[2:05:37] <+cubbywolf> WHENS MAHVEL
[2:05:40] <Heefnoff> Though tbh you'll still get all the moves going and whatever

[2:08:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @leith_aziz they already patched it twice
[2:08:46] <Heefnoff> Even by Marvel standards, Tabs loves high damage characters
[2:09:00] <Heefnoff> Monster Hunter is pretty loyal to her MvC:I design, but she's missing the twin blades
[2:09:01] <+cubbywolf> damage is such a balancing act
[2:09:02] <Super_Voltekka> Wen Blackheart
[2:09:04] <+TopTieramisu> people love touch of death combos
[2:09:09] <leith_aziz> Vergil is now MOTIVATED

[2:10:19] <+cubbywolf> I never heard of game banana until these mods
[2:10:21] <%Juriasu> how come we can mod in new moves and shit, but we can't just edit a picture for the character select?

[2:13:32] <+cubbywolf> a mod with patch notes is a good mod indeed
[2:13:37] <Heefnoff> Patch notes baby
[2:13:46] <+TopTieramisu> vergil studied the blade AND smashed
[2:13:54] <Heefnoff> Fun fact, DMC5 Vergil is Kave's FIRST MODDED CHARACTER
[2:13:59] <+TopTieramisu> big geese energy
[2:14:01] <Heefnoff> And he came up with all this, Tabs was impressed

[2:14:59] <Heefnoff> Love that dude, he's so cool
[2:15:01] <$ggbhtg> Dante Shotgun Cancels or BUST!
[2:15:08] <Heefnoff> Urien is cheap as hell rn
[2:15:13] <+cubbywolf> dodge
[2:15:16] <Heefnoff> Snap in PW, Woolie
[2:15:25] <$ggbhtg> "Just block" intensifies
[2:15:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:32] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:15:32] <Heefnoff> PW should've kept the invul assist for funsies
[2:15:37] <%notsoy> in umvc3 lariat only has two frames of invincibility
[2:15:44] <dds333a> exactly Kappa
[2:15:46] <+cubbywolf> hodl
[2:15:46] <%notsoy> *lariat assist
[2:15:53] <%notsoy> used on point, lariat has all of its proper invincibility
[2:15:55] <Zarflame99> Hello, Woolie, Reggie and chat
[2:15:55] <Heefnoff> As long as that PW assist is punishable, it's fine
[2:16:14] <%SirGO0SE> @Zarflame99 debugWave
[2:16:29] <dds333a> It's quite precise
[2:16:33] <BlackermanZX> you don't want an invul assist when goddamn Morrigan exists
[2:16:54] <+cubbywolf> so cheap, I can't get skilled let me button mash my ToD Lul
[2:16:58] <Heefnoff> Invul assists can have answers though
[2:17:00] <dds333a> Nah, full invul LUL
[2:17:04] <%notsoy> the answer is to shoot her, hsienko will take so much damage as an assist
[2:17:05] <%Juriasu> I remember hsien-ko being fairly popular online back in the day
[2:17:10] <Qsmash_> the answer is tag Hsien-Ko in Kappa
[2:17:12] <%notsoy> she isn't invincible, she just has hyper armor
[2:17:15] <Heefnoff> Phoenix Wright is already so bad on his own
[2:17:19] <Heefnoff> Hsien-Ko armor assist is fine
[2:17:25] <kermitlive> thats my problem with strive
[2:17:25] <%ZweihanderSteve> nothing is overpowered if you just win against it
[2:17:30] <kermitlive> no answers
[2:17:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dark Phoenix Wright Kappa LUL
[2:17:55] <BlackermanZX> dark phoenix is piss poor easy to get
[2:17:57] <dds333a> Save Jean for the very last LUL
[2:17:58] <+cubbywolf> gg seems to always be a game of match-up
[2:18:02] <dds333a> EZ
[2:18:04] <Heefnoff> I wouldn't say let it go, but I think giving PW a benefit to his assist would be nice
[2:18:13] <Heefnoff> Make it force wallbounce even if you already used one
[2:18:16] <Heefnoff> For example
[2:18:25] <+polothegreatest> cornered intensifies
[2:18:53] <BlackermanZX> who tf played Hsien Ko LUL
[2:19:01] <Heefnoff> Literally one pro @BlackermanZX

[2:20:25] <$ggbhtg> phone a friend, Woolie, it's WatcherKave
[2:20:33] <+TopTieramisu> mvc:i had the kof14 problem. the worse style makes the models that would look fine in the other game look worse
[2:20:35] <Heefnoff> Also Woolie, you get issues if you load the modded moveset and the regular moveset at the same time
[2:20:55] <Heefnoff> So don't put DMC5 Vergil on your team and normal Vergil on the regular team, could make your other mods not load
[2:21:02] <+TopTieramisu> many of kof15's models are barely changed from 14 but they all look better because of better lighting and stylistic rendering
[2:21:03] <%townzzzzz> ooooooooooo

[2:26:22] <Heefnoff> @Solidus_113 Been trying out DMC5 Vergil?
[2:26:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> can't you charge Beowolf?
[2:26:30] <@Menitta> I got into Vergil through DMC4 and playing him in marvel 3 was weird for me because he was so different in 3
[2:26:34] <@Solidus_113> no, just bloody palace LUL
[2:26:36] <@Menitta> this is right at home
[2:26:40] <Heefnoff> Lol fair
[2:26:41] <$ggbhtg> @Th3SmartAlec he did
[2:26:46] <Heefnoff> You can also do it in this game, thankfully
[2:26:52] <Heefnoff> Slow start up, but goes nearly full screen
[2:26:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ggbhtg gotcha thanks
[2:26:56] <anuchallengertwitch> Is DMCV special edition avaliable on Steam?
[2:27:03] <@Solidus_113> no but yes
[2:27:06] <+JayCWayC> make reggie human
[2:27:10] <BlackermanZX> Does this have perfect judgement Cut
[2:27:14] <Heefnoff> Just saying you could Parsec it, I'm a bit of a mod expert heefnoFOOTDIVE
[2:27:15] <@Solidus_113> it does
[2:27:19] <Heefnoff> Yes @BlackermanZX
[2:27:19] <dds333a> @menitta since he was using the DMC3 SE. moveset yeah. in fact, Vergil is perpetually stuck in DMC3, in terms of gameplay
[2:27:20] <+vexion_smh> wow dmc 5 vergil
[2:27:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> Can we get a dmc vergil skin please?
[2:27:32] <$ggbhtg> I'll feed you moves in a moment, if that's okay
[2:27:36] <Heefnoff> You have to charge by holding a button, and during heavy attacks/special moves, you can get perfect jdugement cut
[2:27:42] <+TopTieramisu> @Ricky_Rexx vergin skin?
[2:27:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> Just at least the fedora
[2:27:55] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[2:28:03] <Heefnoff> Takes meter thankfully
[2:28:04] <anuchallengertwitch> @Solidus_113 is it like the original version but Vergil DLC is available? So no Legendary Dark Knight?
[2:28:08] <Super_Voltekka> NEO TRI-BRAM
[2:28:11] <Th3rd3> P O W A R
[2:28:14] <$ggbhtg> He needs it btw Kappa
[2:28:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wasn't aware this was mvc INFINITE
[2:28:20] <leith_aziz> Funnily enough, this version of Vergil DOES have an infinite
[2:28:20] <@Solidus_113> correct, it's just vergil
[2:28:24] <leith_aziz> Unless it got patched
[2:28:25] <@Solidus_113> wack but egg
[2:28:26] <@Solidus_113> ehh*
[2:28:37] <WanderingYoren> egg
[2:28:39] <+vexion_smh> PERFECT REPLICA BROKEN AF
[2:28:45] <dds333a> Although Vergil doesn't put his arms out to fire them LUL
[2:28:49] <+JayCWayC> He's lore accuracte, guys. Kappa
[2:28:49] <DedlokPM> @Solidus_113 no legendary dark knight no, but stuff like that and some of the graphical "upgrades" are either already there or in mods
[2:28:50] <+TopTieramisu> tournament illegal
[2:29:15] <@Solidus_113> hopefully PC gets the full update after the RE ones come out
[2:29:33] <%notsoy> the cancel is only on hit? hm
[2:29:43] <$ggbhtg> qcf Special for Blistering Swords @WoolieVersus
[2:29:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:29:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> "Foolishness, me?"
[2:30:08] <dds333a> @leith_aziz albeit nowhere near as insane LUL
[2:30:13] <%notsoy> the launcher is also NOT crossup lmao
[2:30:26] <Heefnoff> Yeah it's kinda messed up lol
[2:30:28] <DSD24> Woolie sounds exhausted
[2:30:34] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes
[2:30:38] <Heefnoff> Also that Stinger can be used in the air lol
[2:30:44] <anuchallengertwitch> I love the consistency that Vergil is always added in special editions or sequels, and is ALWAYS overpowered.
[2:30:44] <DSD24> This is what Vergil does to you
[2:30:48] <BlackermanZX> Judgement NUT
[2:30:50] <+TopTieramisu> what a mixup
[2:30:51] <+polothegreatest> DMCV SE was BS NotLikeThis , no upgrade for previous owners
[2:30:55] <Heefnoff> Air Judgement Cut is the best zoning tool in the game
[2:30:56] <Heefnoff> Free
[2:31:10] <+TopTieramisu> vergil is power fantasy personified
[2:31:14] <Heefnoff> Cause you can get all 4 Judgement cuts lol
[2:31:21] <DSD24> That's dirty
[2:31:27] <@Menitta> apparently I put 80 hours into DMC 5 special edition last year
[2:31:30] <anuchallengertwitch> Here's another important question: is Vergil a Darth VAder?
[2:31:31] <%notsoy> i'm pretty sure i've seen videos with exactly that
[2:31:32] <dds333a> @toptieramisu all for a canon jobber LUL
[2:31:40] <$ggbhtg> fireball + medium for Void Slash @WoolieVersus
[2:31:41] <DSD24> I love the follow up
[2:31:50] <BlackermanZX> perfect judgement cut yeyeye
[2:31:51] <$ggbhtg> then trick dash with 2 buttons
[2:31:52] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch no, not entirely, but kinda Kappa
[2:31:56] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a haha yeah. but at this point he's tied for the strongest in the universe
[2:31:57] <Heefnoff> He has teleports on down down buttons
[2:32:09] <dds333a> Blistering Swords hype
[2:32:11] <+JayCWayC> Woolie's just holding in his judgment nut.
[2:32:36] <Heefnoff> Backwards DP on Medium for his Boss Fight stab lol
[2:32:52] <@Solidus_113> is the PJC still 3-4 frames in this?
[2:32:55] <Heefnoff> Also note that the motions on DMC5 Vergil require more precision, not as much leniancy as other character
[2:33:00] <DSD24> You got this Woolie
[2:33:01] <Heefnoff> @Solidus_113 I think so? NOt sure
[2:33:04] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a basically vegeta with less embarrassing moments
[2:33:10] <Heefnoff> But they give you a visual cue as to when you can do it
[2:33:11] <$ggbhtg> It's after Yamato Heavy attacks and certain Specials @WoolieVersus
[2:33:16] <$ggbhtg> for PJC
[2:33:19] <Heefnoff> A yellow bar appears over your meter any time you can do PJC
[2:33:32] <leith_aziz> "DONT YOU DARE SAY IT!"
[2:33:38] <Heefnoff> Yes, you can get 4 Judgement Cuts and he will say Jackpot
[2:33:38] <dds333a> @toptieramisu exactly LUL since even now he can STILL fight Dante to a standstill
[2:33:41] <leith_aziz> JACKPOT! doodOK
[2:34:05] <dds333a> Sick
[2:34:13] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a Extremely powerful in his verse, tall and dressed in black (in DMCV), Deep booming voice (as Urizen) has telekinesis (again as Urizen),  a strong desire for power to protect love ones and escape trauma (like Anakin), and is the father of another key character.
[2:34:14] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:34:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:34:15] <dds333a> LUL

[2:34:42] <$ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Hold H for 5 secs during JCE to make it unblockable
[2:34:45] <Heefnoff> His OTG is Down Down super

[2:36:23] <$ggbhtg> Hell on Earth is the name
[2:36:34] <$ggbhtg> it OTGs
[2:36:37] <Heefnoff> He also has Devil Trigger, but it's a level 3
[2:36:54] <@Solidus_113> DT also can be done in the air
[2:36:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg

[2:37:03] <dds333a> LUL
[2:37:07] <anuchallengertwitch> I'm pretty sure that Vergil is a Darth Vader
[2:37:08] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes ...  pickyOof
[2:37:14] <aveond> dp back M is another super cool super
[2:37:20] <dds333a> DMC4 shit LUL
[2:37:24] <Heefnoff> It's not a super, just a cool cinematic
[2:37:33] <BlackermanZX> theres another move where he teleports and stabs your ass
[2:37:36] <bill_and_ted_dude> Find the POWER
[2:37:37] <Heefnoff> Also you forgot the most important super, Quarter Circle Forward Taunt
[2:37:45] <Heefnoff> lol
[2:37:51] <dds333a> here we go
[2:37:51] <leith_aziz> doodNuts
[2:37:52] <DSD24> Best DT design
[2:38:15] <leith_aziz> Now Vergil is more broken pickyCrazy
[2:38:16] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 yeah, the SMT devil trigger
[2:38:16] <Heefnoff> He also can mash out Rapid Slash in Devil Trigger
[2:38:17] <dds333a> @dsd24 also the most enduring LUL
[2:38:21] <Heefnoff> But it costs meter
[2:38:43] <DSD24> Not to say DMC5 DT is bad or anything but I love the Kaneko designs
[2:38:49] <Heefnoff> Quarter Circle Forward Taunt please
[2:38:52] <$ggbhtg> Rapid Slash costs extra meter, but nothing else
[2:38:53] <%notsoy> chain rapid slashes
[2:38:59] <DSD24> The DT changing on the weapon you are holding is so cool
[2:39:04] <$ggbhtg> DT Rapid Slash costs extra meter, but nothing else, just like the game
[2:39:13] <anuchallengertwitch> Any love for Majin Devil Trigger from DMC2?
[2:39:31] <DSD24> @anuchallengertwitch That's the super tall one right?
[2:39:36] <+elderpunch> @DSD24 same
[2:39:37] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch That and chain gun hands DT, yes
[2:39:38] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 SDT Dante is doodOK but Vergil DT is pickyPog
[2:39:45] <$ggbhtg> Stinger is changed too
[2:39:56] <Heefnoff> Woolie
[2:40:01] <$ggbhtg> Rapid Slash is the only one that costs meter
[2:40:05] <Heefnoff> Quarter Circle Forward Taunt lol
[2:40:06] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 yeah, with four angle wings and laser swords in his wrists
[2:40:06] <Heefnoff> YES
[2:40:15] <dds333a> LUL
[2:40:18] <Heefnoff> You can do it as long as you have 3 bars
[2:40:21] <Heefnoff> It's the best
[2:40:24] <dds333a> the juggle taunt
[2:40:33] <leith_aziz> SMOKIN SEXY STYLE!
[2:40:35] <$ggbhtg> just gotta have 3 bars here
[2:40:44] <Heefnoff> Also Backwards DP Medium
[2:40:45] <DSD24> @anuchallengertwitch Yeah that one is really cool looking, I like how different it is
[2:40:53] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 plus the Dmc3 devil trigger changes its look depending on which weapon you're using. most evident with Dante
[2:40:56] <Heefnoff> You didn't do that one yet
[2:41:11] <BlackermanZX> you can also wall jump damn
[2:41:16] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:41:23] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 It was definitely the inspiration for Sin/Shin Devil Trigger
[2:41:25] <leith_aziz> Oh yeah, we DIDNT EVEN FACTOR IN X FACTOR
[2:41:28] <leith_aziz> pickyAYAYA
[2:41:35] <%townzzzzz> woolie at risk
[2:41:43] <Heefnoff> Backwards DP Medium does his boss stab
[2:42:01] <DSD24> @anuchallengertwitch My favorite was Angi and Rudra's DT I like how it has two different energy sources with the wind and fire from Agni and Rudra
[2:42:12] <Heefnoff> He still has crown thankfully
[2:42:12] <dds333a> Spiral Swords, Storm, so on
[2:42:21] <%anarchistPastry> hes got graps skittles!
[2:42:23] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Woolie my guy! Sorry for the lateness, I was partaking in the worlds first Raid completion for Destiny 2 but my group has given up for the night after 4 hours. Either way, keep up the good work my guys, not long till Ultimax, I'm coming for you Reggie!
[2:42:43] <Heefnoff> This version of Vergil has a new version of Sword Loops
[2:42:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 Yeah, Angi an Rudra DT looks sick. I love all of the spikes on his legs. I also like the Beowulf DT too
[2:43:16] <Heefnoff> It just replaces one color, Woolie
[2:43:23] <$ggbhtg> back plus Special for Rising Dragon into Dragon Breaker, while in DT @WoolieVersus
[2:43:25] <Heefnoff> Any color other than default is still normal vergil
[2:43:27] <BlackermanZX> reverse dp medium
[2:43:30] <bill_and_ted_dude> What's the DT'd Deep Stinger look like?
[2:43:32] <$ggbhtg> oh boy
[2:43:35] <Heefnoff> No wait hold up I gotta clear that misinformation up
[2:43:36] <$ggbhtg> we moving
[2:43:40] <BlackermanZX> backwards i mean
[2:43:47] <Heefnoff> DMC5 Vergil is only on color 1, every other color is still default
[2:44:00] <DSD24> @anuchallengertwitch The Nevan DT is really cool looking too with the wings
[2:44:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:44:01] <dds333a> Quite faithful, yeah
[2:44:08] <leith_aziz> This is so weird to see
[2:44:20] <DSD24> Best girl Monhun
[2:44:22] <leith_aziz> pickyStare
[2:44:33] <dds333a> Reg won't let the demo happen LUL
[2:45:16] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 I also love the Cerberus DT, mostly because I love Dante's Cerberus Crazy combo quotes with the DT filter
[2:45:17] <DSD24> I love the shoulder check
[2:45:19] <BlackermanZX> GOD i want X so bad
[2:45:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> her neutral stance looks like a bansho
[2:45:31] <Heefnoff> A version of X already exists @BlackermanZX
[2:45:33] <anuchallengertwitch> @BlackermanZX I think he is in this mod
[2:45:38] <Heefnoff> It's in emc's EX DLC
[2:45:43] <DSD24> @anuchallengertwitch Is that the one where he does the ice storm and goes ITS COOL!
[2:45:48] <BlackermanZX> nice
[2:45:55] <anuchallengertwitch> @DSD24 YES
[2:46:12] <Heefnoff> EX DLC is where Stars Jill is from, you guys have him already
[2:46:17] <Heefnoff> You're all good guys, sorry to scare you
[2:46:20] <DSD24> @anuchallengertwitch Oh man I love that one, my favorite DT filter is the Stinger into Breakdown
[2:46:25] <+Ricky_Rexx> Will we ever get a dmc song better than Bury the Light? Probably not right?
[2:46:28] <DSD24> Ha ha ha ha BREAKDOWN!
[2:46:34] <huskarl_zap> is monster hunter jakovavich?
[2:46:34] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:46:50] <+Ricky_Rexx> someone make that mod
[2:46:51] <%SirGO0SE> how could you didnt this get patched a couple hours ago? LUL
[2:46:53] <Heefnoff> I know these characters like the back of my hand, I got you
[2:46:53] <%Shad0wTag> @Ricky_Rexx I think its possible but only if Capcom go all out on the sound design again
[2:47:06] <Heefnoff> You cancel the 6H into charged slash
[2:47:08] <DSD24> Nah MonHun is a nice lady with white hair she ain't Mila
[2:47:16] <Heefnoff> And you have follow ups after the charge slash on H, or 6H
[2:47:18] <dds333a> Nova goes "YOU LIKE THAT"
[2:47:26] <Heefnoff> She can also loop her Arrow super
[2:47:30] <Heefnoff> She still gets this lol
[2:47:32] <DSD24> @dds333a Then he goes POWER OF THE NOVA FORCE
[2:47:49] <Heefnoff> It still works, I love it
[2:47:57] <Heefnoff> Tabs loves giving characters loops with Supers
[2:48:02] <Heefnoff> He also loves high damage
[2:48:11] <dds333a> Good ol RE1
[2:48:12] <DSD24> Best Jill
[2:48:19] <DSD24> Blonde Jill the worst Jill
[2:48:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> caw caw
[2:48:22] <Heefnoff> Jill is sick, cause she  can stance cancel her supers
[2:48:28] <Heefnoff> Sorry I meant her specials
[2:48:33] <PKSomething> Yes there is, Frank has them
[2:48:33] <%townzzzzz> what about the dogs
[2:48:38] <Heefnoff> Jill can call animals, stance cancel, then call them again
[2:48:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> When are we getting the RE character jovavich played?
[2:48:41] <Heefnoff> The stance is 22S
[2:48:42] <+TopTieramisu> beret jill > wannabe cammy jill
[2:48:43] <%townzzzzz> oh....
[2:48:45] <BlackermanZX> GUN
[2:48:57] <anuchallengertwitch> what about Frank's zombies
[2:48:59] <%Shad0wTag> What about Frank's zombies?
[2:48:59] <Heefnoff> STARS Jill is on my main mod team
[2:49:03] <Super_Voltekka> So no Blackheart? FeelsBadMan
[2:49:06] <Heefnoff> @anuchallengertwitch Technical limitiations
[2:49:17] <anuchallengertwitch> When Venom?
[2:49:20] <Heefnoff> Basically anything unique to a character is tied to that character's slot
[2:49:21] <DSD24> I like that super
[2:49:25] <dds333a> SOMERSAULT
[2:49:29] <Heefnoff> So, you can't give Jill zombies without putting her on Frank's slot
[2:49:36] <DSD24> Hit em with tha BRRRRY
[2:49:39] <DSD24> Brrrt
[2:49:44] <+TopTieramisu> that's a weird quirk
[2:49:48] <Heefnoff> I'm not the biggest expert but I know about these characters and some of the technical limitations
[2:49:48] <anuchallengertwitch> @Heefnoff Ok, I get that
[2:49:50] <anuchallengertwitch> X
[2:49:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> nah this is fine LUL
[2:49:58] <Heefnoff> X is on Alt costume of Zero

[2:50:32] <+TopTieramisu> ah yes, X Zero, Zero Zero's brother
[2:50:36] <Heefnoff> I always show up when people play modded UMVC3 because I know enough to help out
[2:50:40] <dds333a> Zero
[2:50:46] <Heefnoff> Also, I'm one of the best mod players around rn
[2:50:46] <Darkuu_X> Yo, Woolie from Super Best Friends
[2:50:49] <anuchallengertwitch> I think Megaman exe could be a sick character in a Hyper fighter. He'd basically be like Dante with all he can do
[2:50:54] <dds333a> Now, he's his own character, again Kappa
[2:50:58] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff No worries man, I've seen you in Fighterz knowing your shit there

[2:51:28] <Super_Voltekka> Did I just see him shoot a Hadoken?
[2:51:33] <Heefnoff> UMVC3 is my main game though, always my favorite
[2:51:34] <dds333a> That should be an ohko Kappa
[2:51:40] <BlackermanZX> thank god the has different moves
[2:51:42] <+TopTieramisu> x has the strongest hadouken
[2:51:45] <anuchallengertwitch> @Super_Voltekka yeah, he has that from X1
[2:51:55] <Heefnoff> X is great because he still has Zero's basic kit
[2:52:01] <Heefnoff> He still has buster, he still gets stuff off it
[2:52:22] <huskarl_zap> Nick cage Kreygasm
[2:52:23] <Super_Voltekka> @anuchallengertwitch Yeah I know I'm just surprised they remembered that tidbit
[2:52:36] <Heefnoff> No level 3 iirc
[2:52:40] <+TopTieramisu> zero from MMZ is the coolest
[2:52:41] <anuchallengertwitch> @Super_Voltekka He also does it in one of his supers in Project X Zone.
[2:52:46] <+TopTieramisu> he has blade, buster, and other weapons
[2:52:54] <dds333a> I miss Wolvie's theme
[2:53:02] <anuchallengertwitch> @TopTieramisu Imma need you to say that a bit louder for the people in the back
[2:53:07] <BlackermanZX> X has a lot of moves he can do and they chose the worst ones in MVCI
[2:53:11] <Heefnoff> Woolie, you CAN revert back
[2:53:15] <Heefnoff> Just don't pick default color
[2:53:16] <Heefnoff> That's it
[2:53:16] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:53:21] <Raldavar> What infinites he has tho?
[2:53:34] <Heefnoff> Literally any color besides default, correct
[2:53:41] <@Solidus_113> but of course you can't pick both
[2:53:44] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu you trying to get my comments deleted? LUL i know what happens when i type in all caps
[2:53:47] <anuchallengertwitch> You know what would be SICK as an alternate? Omega Zero from MMZ3
[2:53:49] <Heefnoff> I'll try and get Kave to add a unique portrait so it's more clear
[2:53:58] <%Shad0wTag> You'd think they change his colour to the black alt
[2:54:05] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch Omega Knuckle Kreygasm
[2:54:05] <+TopTieramisu> zero with the deep red looks nice
[2:54:10] <anuchallengertwitch> @TopTieramisu oh yeah, my bad
[2:54:12] <Heefnoff> Right now I'm trying to get Malamander to nerf Urien slightly, that man is insane rn lol
[2:54:31] <huskarl_zap> uh oh its the lean monster
[2:54:35] <Super_Voltekka> Thanos Haggar, Mayor of the Universe
[2:54:35] <DSD24> Everyone likes Psyloke
[2:54:42] <DSD24> Wesker theme time
[2:54:47] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a  also him having that ground pound laser move and  Ranbu (aka sword raging demon)
[2:55:09] <+TopTieramisu> LMAO
[2:55:16] <marcomatame> INSANITY
[2:55:18] <%notsoy> was that chip, or was the last hit an overhead?
[2:55:23] <+TopTieramisu> he straight up did the bart simpson
[2:55:36] <dds333a> real zoner hours
[2:55:56] <anuchallengertwitch> Yeah, I'd love it if they added Omega Zero somehow
[2:56:13] <Super_Voltekka> Does this Jill still have her rush attack from MvC2?
[2:56:21] <Heefnoff> Not the super, but yes @Super_Voltekka
[2:56:26] <Heefnoff> And she can stance cancel it
[2:56:30] <+TopTieramisu> if capcom does decide to continue the mmx series, they should adapt the elf wars with omega and everything
[2:56:47] <BlackermanZX> they wont because they are cowards
[2:57:04] <anuchallengertwitch> @TopTieramisu Yeah. I'd love to see where characters like Weil first appeared
[2:57:10] <DSD24> This tag is RAW

[2:58:51] <+TopTieramisu> @BlackermanZX exactly
[2:58:51] <BlackermanZX> too much MOTIVATION
[2:58:57] <Heefnoff> No one, it's just unstable
[2:59:01] <marcomatame> Are Vergil's animations imported from DMC4SE? Or is the modder just a gigachad and recreated the animations from scratch?
[2:59:03] <Heefnoff> Especially since it was only mods on screen haha
[2:59:19] <Heefnoff> No, they recreated them based on animations in UMVC3 @marcomatame
[2:59:39] <anuchallengertwitch> I love the announcers enthusiams on the character selection screen
[2:59:42] <marcomatame> @Heefnoff so gigachad, noted
[2:59:48] <Heefnoff> Yep, gigachad
[2:59:53] <huskarl_zap> Wesker (S.T.A.R.S.) < Wesker (Total Global Saturation)
[3:00:24] <Super_Voltekka> Wen War Machine?
[3:00:38] <anuchallengertwitch> When VENOM?
[3:00:38] <Heefnoff> @Super_Voltekka Currently in development actually
[3:00:40] <Heefnoff> So, soonish
[3:00:49] <Heefnoff> @anuchallengertwitch Probably not until we get an animation importer made
[3:00:56] <Heefnoff> But IF that happens, then it should be a lot easier
[3:00:57] <dds333a> LUL
[3:01:08] <huskarl_zap> Whens Ethan?
[3:01:18] <DSD24> When's lady D

[3:01:38] <anuchallengertwitch> @Heefnoff ok. that's cool. didn't know you were a developer
[3:01:48] <DSD24> When's Soakon
[3:01:56] <Heefnoff> I'm still an amateur to the whole thing, but yes @anuchallengertwitch
[3:02:08] <+TopTieramisu> ninjitsu ü§û
[3:02:09] <Heefnoff> That's why I haven't been shutting up this stream lmao, very passionate about this stuff
[3:02:24] <anuchallengertwitch> @Heefnoff Looks REALLY great so far. Keep up the good work
[3:02:35] <Heefnoff> Thanks, we will! @anuchallengertwitch
[3:02:53] <BlackermanZX> BEHOLD!
[3:03:03] <DSD24> So mysterjous
[3:03:04] <anuchallengertwitch> I love how this mod has breathed new life into an already hype game
[3:03:08] <Heefnoff> Nero is also TRYING to be made rn
[3:03:12] <LoreKeeper_Thal> not even G rank smh
[3:03:13] <Heefnoff> But he's been a struggle
[3:03:18] <%townzzzzz> low rank, high rank, G rank
[3:03:33] <Heefnoff> His main issue is just, it's pretty hard to make things look good with because no new animations
[3:03:38] <aveond> I'm assuming nero would be ontop of spencer for an easier base but still doesn't seem easy
[3:03:48] <anuchallengertwitch> Yeah I can see that, Nero has alot of unique stuff compared to Dante and Vergil
[3:03:52] <Heefnoff> So you're half right @aveond
[3:03:59] <marcomatame> They made New Vergil into the Chipp the game needed
[3:04:05] <ElPlasa> @Heefnoff oh god, I can't even begin to think what mechanic you would give dmc5 nero
[3:04:06] <Heefnoff> Nero would have to be either on Spencer or on Dante, he requires things from both
[3:04:22] <dds333a> LUL
[3:04:27] <Heefnoff> @anuchallengertwitch Ironically the problem is actually how much he has to borrow
[3:04:29] <%townzzzzz> NUTTED
[3:04:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> its only hitting me now that they're playing with ONLY modded characters.  this is the BEST
[3:04:39] <Heefnoff> Because certain moves/unique elements are actually tied to character slots
[3:04:53] <Heefnoff> So, you CAN'T give a character a zombie, for example, unless you put them over Frank West
[3:05:00] <Heefnoff> That's why Jill doesn't have zombies
[3:05:06] <Viewtiful_Rose> Oh shit it‚Äôs Heef
[3:05:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[3:05:08] <huskarl_zap> suck on kick?
[3:05:10] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[3:05:14] <Heefnoff> It's a little specific, and not completely obvious which properties belong to who
[3:05:18] <Heefnoff> Oh hello! @Viewtiful_Rose
[3:05:27] <kinkade_77> oh look its moonveil katana
[3:05:35] <+TopTieramisu> cancelled bury the light
[3:05:36] <Viewtiful_Rose> I love seeing the marvel dudes in other streams I like
[3:05:48] <Heefnoff> But yeah Cyclops being over Viper wasn't just a cute nod to C. Viper, he literally HAD to be put over Viper or else he wouldn't work
[3:05:55] <aveond> I'd assume that nero on spencer would be the easier one since DMC1 dante is already on a char and spencer has zips which'd be v useful for nero
[3:05:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @Heefnoff Yeah that does seem tricky. You guys have  managed to make it work well enough so far, like with Cyclops and Thanos for example. do what you guys think can work well, and don't stress out
[3:06:03] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i don't think so
[3:06:03] <Heefnoff> Well thank you, I really appreciate it @Viewtiful_Rose
[3:06:04] <huskarl_zap> THE LEAN MONSTER
[3:06:04] <aveond> but it STILL doesn't seem easy in the slightest
[3:06:07] <dds333a> Thanos has been happy quite a lot
[3:06:20] <dds333a> Just, malevolently happy LUL
[3:06:40] <BlackermanZX> s c h u m
[3:06:42] <Heefnoff> @aveond Correct, Spencer is the choice I personally think is better. The problem is, Nero's kit is also very sword based, and so he needs to borrow Dante moves
[3:06:43] <Viewtiful_Rose> You‚Äôre also cracked so I like watching ur play @heefnoff
[3:06:58] <aveond> That is true, damn
[3:07:07] <Heefnoff> @anuchallengertwitch Thank you, I really appreciate it. I do promise good stuff is in development, though I'm not allowed to spoil anything yet haha
[3:07:19] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[3:07:20] <Heefnoff> Obviously there's Gambit to look forward to though, if you didn't know. He's in dev rn
[3:07:29] <dds333a> A real mon ami
[3:07:32] <+TopTieramisu> whose moveset is gambit bodified from?
[3:07:35] <+TopTieramisu> modified*
[3:07:36] <Heefnoff> @Viewtiful_Rose Thank you! Means a lot, I honestly think I'm still on the weaker end of the TNS players
[3:07:37] <DSD24> Frank I think
[3:07:41] <aveond> I've done a lot of ssb melee modding so I know your plight of limited options, so I wish you the best but you can 100% do it
[3:07:41] <Heefnoff> But hey, I'm getting there
[3:07:42] <+Superbro64> how did DBFZ go? Were there player matches?
[3:07:47] <BlackermanZX> BURY THE LIII-
[3:07:49] <Heefnoff> Correct, he's over Frank @DSD24
[3:07:55] <anuchallengertwitch> good call, no spoilers. The best moments re when an entirely new character is revealed in a unrelated trailer
[3:07:55] <Heefnoff> No @Superbro64
[3:07:55] <+TopTieramisu> bury the bury the ight
[3:07:57] <+TopTieramisu> light*
[3:08:04] <Heefnoff> Thank you so much @aveond
[3:08:05] <+Superbro64> @heefnoff you hate to see it LUL
[3:08:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> The just touched 21 and that was it
[3:08:07] <dds333a> MCU Thanny is a bit more of a sad sack
[3:08:08] <DSD24> Bury the mute button
[3:08:12] <Viewtiful_Rose> Well I like watching u Heff and that‚Äôs gotta count for something
[3:08:18] <aveond> man that gambit reveal had me geeking tbh, can't wait for more char reveals like that
[3:08:20] <Heefnoff> I also literally can't @anuchallengertwitch there's a code between modders to not spoil things without permission
[3:08:28] <+TopTieramisu> Bury the Sound
[3:08:39] <Heefnoff> I will say there's also a great stage in development, meant to be a tribute to UMVC3
[3:08:40] <aveond> or stage reveals, very excited for the next big thing from the modding community
[3:08:41] <DSD24> "I wanted to punish you"
[3:08:43] <anuchallengertwitch> @Heefnoff yeah, that's a good thing to have between modders
[3:08:47] <Heefnoff> It's great, has Zero being created in a tube and shit
[3:08:53] <Viewtiful_Rose> Maybe once I actually start playing marvel again we can play :) @heefnoff
[3:08:53] <Heefnoff> Very cool stage, not completely done yet
[3:09:05] <Heefnoff> Absolutely! Just hit me up whenever, I'd be happy to play @Viewtiful_Rose
[3:09:19] <Viewtiful_Rose> I just need a pc cuz I haven‚Äôt had one in years :(
[3:09:30] <Heefnoff> Yeah we kinda need to lol. Partially in case there are problems or things get abandoned @anuchallengertwitch
[3:10:09] <Heefnoff> But yeah very glad Woolie's been checking out the mods
[3:10:16] <dds333a> Reg PJSalt
[3:10:35] <%notsoy> yeah that's unblockable
[3:10:41] <+TopTieramisu> thanos is built like peter dinklage in infinity war

[3:11:37] <dds333a> @aveond R.E.G System undergoing maintenance
[3:11:39] <Heefnoff> Sorry Woolz, I may have gotten Thanos' level 3 nerfed lol
[3:11:43] <Heefnoff> You used to be able to 300% with it
[3:12:06] <Heefnoff> It's still unblockable, but it doesn't hard knockdown anymore, meaning you need to X-Factor to extend it.

[3:16:00] <aveond> Dude urien is so sick
[3:16:06] <Heefnoff> Urien is busted as hell lol
[3:16:09] <Heefnoff> (Urien main btw)
[3:16:11] <+TopTieramisu> i miss the days when mvc3 tournies would constantly show new tech in combos
[3:16:20] <aveond> aegis should maaaaaaaybe be a lvl 2 or even a lvl3 but I'll be damned if that character can't get some stuff done
[3:16:34] <Heefnoff> The real issue with Aegis is that it shouldn't nullify supers
[3:16:35] <aveond> dp back L for free float combos? ooh
[3:16:40] <Heefnoff> That alone makes the top tiers irrelevant
[3:16:47] <Heefnoff> Not to mention the fact he gets 2 Aegis per bar
[3:17:03] <aveond> oh ye it needs to have its projectile HP or duration nerfed by a lot
[3:17:10] <emptyantics> What doesnX Factor do again?
[3:17:16] <Heefnoff> In a game with a lot of great neutral projectiles, nullifying prohectiles is huge
[3:17:19] <BlackermanZX> oh man now i want a Shiranui version of Amaterasu in this game
[3:17:26] <Heefnoff> @emptyantics Speed/damage buff, and it heals Red health
[3:17:40] <Heefnoff> Not sure if anyone's working on Amaterasu modscurrently
[3:17:42] <aveond> Urien + doom w/ rocks feels nutty but damn it feels good to main urien
[3:17:55] <Heefnoff> Urien is just so cheap
[3:17:58] <dds333a> @blackermanzx might look fantastic, yeah
[3:17:59] <+TopTieramisu> x factor is dark phoenix's free win card
[3:18:04] <Heefnoff> I play STARS Wesker/STARS Jill/Urien
[3:18:12] <Heefnoff> That team is just, cracked
[3:18:13] <emptyantics> @heefnoff Thanks havent played UMVC 3 in a hot while
[3:18:16] <Heefnoff> I also really like Captain Marvel
[3:18:31] <Heefnoff> @emptyantics It's amazing rn, definitely a great time to get back in
[3:18:33] <+TopTieramisu> captain marvel's model was pretty good
[3:18:36] <aveond> urien/doom + rocks/mvc2 sentinel
[3:18:40] <aveond> Damn that team is nutty
[3:18:42] <Carlioo> @Heefnoff was wondering if someone had modded her in yet
[3:18:48] <+TopTieramisu> definitely got more love than the marvel characters in infinite
[3:18:50] <Heefnoff> Yeah, she's in @Carlioo
[3:18:51] <Azimuth_24> I deadass tried this mod out for 20 or so minutes and haven't picked it up since

[3:22:58] <marcomatame> Is the Ken model from Smash?
[3:23:03] <Heefnoff> Yes @marcomatame
[3:23:12] <Heefnoff> Smash Ken with some minor edits
[3:23:14] <+TopTieramisu> purple might as well be the default color for psychic attacks
[3:23:25] <Azimuth_24> I wonder if that also explains why the zombies are hard coded to Frank and can't be put on Jilly
[3:23:28] <Azimuth_24> *jill
[3:23:29] <Azimuth_24> smfh
[3:23:30] <marcomatame> @Heefnoff makes sense. but seeing SFV Ken here wouldve been funny
[3:23:34] <Heefnoff> Sort of, yes @Azimuth_24
[3:23:39] <dds333a> looks so sick in blue too
[3:23:46] <marcomatame> depressing, but in a funny way

[3:24:07] <emptyantics> LUL
[3:24:10] <+TopTieramisu> jill with a shopping cart. jill with a shopping cart
[3:24:13] <Heefnoff> The reason STARS Jill isn't over Frank is because she has a more fun gimmick
[3:24:17] <Heefnoff> Over Jill slot
[3:24:23] <Heefnoff> That is, she can stance cancel
[3:24:30] <Super_Voltekka> Can we mod Tron Bonne so that she's riding the PTX from Lost Planet/TvC?
[3:24:32] <Heefnoff> (Though Reggie didn't find that out in time sadly)
[3:24:49] <marcomatame> It's still weird to think that Smash has the most visually appealing 3d models for Ryu and Ken
[3:24:58] <Azimuth_24> Indeed
[3:25:01] <+TopTieramisu> is it weird though?
[3:25:12] <+TopTieramisu> smash's adaptations of characters have always been super respectful
[3:25:13] <%townzzzzz> there better be a dragon install
[3:25:19] <BlackermanZX> i wonder if they can mod Zero and Volnutt from TVC
[3:25:22] <+TopTieramisu> look at mega man
[3:25:25] <dds333a> @marcomatame still can't get a decent Samus model without using Sarah Bryant LUL
[3:25:29] <Heefnoff> Not that simple @BlackermanZX
[3:25:36] <Heefnoff> Though, it's an interesting question
[3:25:49] <BlackermanZX> yeah since not a single character do what they do in tvc
[3:25:56] <Heefnoff> Modding TVC Zero in actually would be doable
[3:26:05] <Heefnoff> But Volnutt would require new animations most likely
[3:26:10] <+TopTieramisu> samus' suit must always be her dread outfit moving forward
[3:26:11] <+pupil31> AYAYA
[3:26:13] <+TopTieramisu> i demand it

[3:26:24] <Heefnoff> Batsu is likely

[3:26:33] <drhivesphd> Urien Aya LUL
[3:26:35] <Heefnoff> TVC Frank I have no clue
[3:26:48] <Azimuth_24> at the very least, this has gotten me brainstorming stuff I wanna do once I become a modder for this
[3:26:50] <aveond> how doable would MVCI Jedah be over somebody like dormammu?
[3:26:52] <Heefnoff> Generally, just realize that we can't import new animations, we have to splice to gether existing assets
[3:27:05] <Heefnoff> Uhhhh
[3:27:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:27:06] <aveond> Tho I have no idea how you'd go about meshing the char into the game unfort
[3:27:13] <drhivesphd> SOL BAD.. GIRL?
[3:27:16] <Heefnoff> You maybe could do it, but it'd have to be over Morrigan I think @aveond
[3:27:21] <Heefnoff> Because of the dash
[3:27:23] <aveond> oh yeah u right, my b
[3:27:28] <dds333a> LUL

[3:29:11] <BlackermanZX> UwUrien cant be stopped
[3:29:14] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i'd say it's more a problem with ken specifically. chun looks good in 5
[3:29:15] <Heefnoff> Of course! I'm still gonna be around for another hour or so
[3:29:24] <Heefnoff> I have to run my local in a little bit but I wouldn't miss this
[3:29:29] <drhivesphd> kinda chilly today eh Urien? Kappa
[3:29:40] <TheScorpionEater> fine.
[3:29:43] <Heefnoff> We all appreciate folks checking out the mods
[3:29:44] <+Azathotic> @Heefnoff If you cant bring in new animations how is Urien doing his usual moves?
[3:29:57] <%notsoy> charge stand H for urien OTG
[3:29:58] <Heefnoff> @Azathotic Ok, so basically we splice together anims that are already in the game
[3:30:03] <dds333a> DESTROY
[3:30:07] <Heefnoff> If you look carefully, Urien's fireball is actually using Morrigan's animation
[3:30:08] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff botaniFinger you guys do amazing work
[3:30:10] <+pupil31> Okay LUL
[3:30:12] <Heefnoff> That's why the air version looks kinda funky
[3:30:18] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu basically every world warrior looks pretty good in 5. hot ryu looks good
[3:30:24] <Heefnoff> We combine animations together to try and make them look faithful
[3:30:26] <+TopTieramisu> except ken
[3:30:46] <+Azathotic> @Heefnoff Im noticing Urien has his shoulder charge animation, I dont remember anyone in Marvel 3 having that animation?
[3:30:55] <+TopTieramisu> i guess gief looks weird in 5
[3:31:01] <Heefnoff> I'm just a supporter, guys like Tabs and Malamander are the real champions @drhivesphd
[3:31:01] <dds333a> SHORYU REPPA
[3:31:01] <+TopTieramisu> but not ken level
[3:31:16] <Heefnoff> @Azathotic I didn't make Urien so I couldn't tell you exactly what was spliced
[3:31:27] <Heefnoff> But I'm telling you that's how we have to make moves, that's all we can do right now
[3:31:37] <+Azathotic> @Heefnoff When you say spliced, are you actually tweaking in-game animations or replacing?
[3:31:39] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff i do mean all of you guys this is great
[3:31:41] <Heefnoff> We'd need an animation importer to do some of the crazier characters like Venom
[3:31:50] <Heefnoff> @Azathotic I mean tweaking in game anims
[3:31:51] <+Azathotic> Just curious
[3:31:56] <%notsoy> lmao venom, you would HAVE to import everything from mvci
[3:31:58] <+Azathotic> Oh thats really cool
[3:32:05] <Heefnoff> So like, we take the startup of Morrigan's fireball, and combine it with Ryu's hadoken pose
[3:32:07] <Heefnoff> For example
[3:32:13] <+Azathotic> Oh thats really smart
[3:32:14] <Heefnoff> Pretty much @notsoy
[3:32:26] <+Azathotic> I noticed Urien has Doom's effects for his launcher lol
[3:32:29] <Heefnoff> And Model importer took forever to make, people aren't exactly experts at the MT Framework engine
[3:32:30] <%notsoy> isn't that what they did for some of captain marvel's shit?
[3:32:31] <dds333a> I'm out of here, once again, says Spidey LUL
[3:32:34] <Heefnoff> Correct @Azathotic
[3:32:35] <drhivesphd> the day Venom gets into mvc3 would be a momentous ocassion i bet @heefnoff
[3:32:51] <Heefnoff> Oh that would mean we've made it  as a modding scene @drhivesphd
[3:32:57] <+pupil31> :3
[3:33:03] <Heefnoff> People don't realize this, but we've almost doubled the amount of playable characters in the game
[3:33:06] <dds333a> Take him out LUL
[3:33:14] <+Parrish_broadnax> this just became protect the president lol
[3:33:19] <+pupil31> LET'S ROCK
[3:33:21] <marcomatame> @TopTieramisu idk man, I don't think most characters can look good in SF5. It might be a personal thing but everyone in that game looks like claymation but with muscles and veins and my psyche just finds that repulsive
[3:33:21] <Heefnoff> There are about 34 well-made mod characters
[3:33:25] <drhivesphd> that basically means the door has been bustef wide open, i hope to see that day @heefnoff
[3:33:26] <aveond> ye when venom is actually added to mvc3 is the day that more or less *any* character can be added
[3:33:29] <Heefnoff> UMVC3 has 50 characters by default
[3:33:34] <Heefnoff> Yes, so do I @drhivesphd
[3:33:41] <+Parrish_broadnax> IT WAS THERE
[3:33:45] <Heefnoff> The big challenges rn are adding new character slots, and adding new animations
[3:33:46] <aveond> wouldn't make it any easier but it'd bump the amount of freedom for character choices through the roof
[3:33:57] <Heefnoff> If those two things happen, this game won't just live forever, it'll thrive forever
[3:34:02] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame i'd say that's more an issue with the texturework, lighting, and style.
[3:34:17] <Heefnoff> Though figuring out how to add completely new character slots is a huge challenge rn
[3:34:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[3:34:20] <aveond> turn mvc3 into the next Mugen PogU
[3:34:41] <Heefnoff> That's the plan lol @aveond
[3:34:44] <Heefnoff> At least long term
[3:34:47] <aveond> I'd assume it'd be easier with an external tool like what tabs is developing but not easy in the slightest
[3:34:49] <Super_Voltekka> @aveond Exactly what I was thinking. MUGEN, but for 2.5D fighters
[3:34:53] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame it also doesn't help with certain characters the hair movement is physics based and not baked in animation
[3:34:55] <Heefnoff> For now, we generally just want to make the best MVC game
[3:35:10] <dds333a> Ken wins again Kappa
[3:35:14] <Heefnoff> I was brainstorming a mod of Cloud from FF7, but part of me doesn't want to work on it yet
[3:35:24] <Heefnoff> I feel like we should just keep it to Marvel and Capcom for now
[3:35:28] <Heefnoff> But that's just me
[3:35:34] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame i don't like how vega looks in 5 but he's not a playable character in world warrior so my comment still stands for the most part
[3:35:40] <huskarl_zap> announcer just said "it's like it's choreographed" literally calling it rigged nice
[3:35:40] <marcomatame> @TopTieramisu Yeah I agree with that, it's not like the models are badly done, but the choice of textures and lack of stylized lightning just creates something out of the uncanny valley.
[3:35:42] <%Shad0wTag> I would prefer it be Marvel and Capcom characters
[3:35:43] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff well captain falcon exists already LUL
[3:35:52] <Heefnoff> Right, but not as a whole moveset @drhivesphd
[3:35:54] <%townzzzzz> the rage rematch
[3:35:59] <drhivesphd> but yes i prefer it be mvc characters for now
[3:36:24] <Heefnoff> The minute a mod character gets made that isn't a Capcom or Marvel property, I think it'll fundamentally change the modding scene
[3:36:26] <drhivesphd> or characters that deserve an mvc apperancr
[3:36:37] <BlackermanZX> AYAYA REFLECTOR kolKyougasm
[3:36:40] <%Shad0wTag> I think the goal would be to explore long forgotten Marvel and Capcom characters and trying to creatively and hardware wise making it work
[3:36:40] <Micha8449> If you turn on the English voice for Lei-Lei, the Urien voicelines will work
[3:36:41] <Heefnoff> And personally, I think we all like using it to make our dream Marvel game, rather than just "Mugen 2"
[3:36:42] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame yeah, those things make a huge difference. kof 15 characters look way better than 14, even when a lot of the models have very few differences. it's the difference in lighting and style
[3:36:43] <aveond> Only charas I'd like to see at this point would 100% be mvc2 magneto & juri, but it juri is doable for another year or 2
[3:36:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:36:50] <%MutedMimic> LUL Û†ÄÄ
[3:36:56] <Heefnoff> Juri is actually in development right now lol @aveond
[3:37:08] <Heefnoff> Mvc2 Magneto we considered, but we don't really want to do it
[3:37:10] <aveond> OH SHIT
[3:37:20] <drhivesphd> @aveond mvc2 magneto overlo7NICE
[3:37:25] <Heefnoff> MVC3 Magneto is just, kinda better lol
[3:37:31] <%notsoy> mvc2 mag is system differences, not character changes
[3:37:32] <drhivesphd> pls no LUL
[3:37:37] <aveond> ye either I wanted mvc2 magneto or mvc2 storm, but mvc3 mag is fine
[3:37:37] <Heefnoff> There's not enough unique about MVC2 mags to make a compelling mod
[3:37:39] <dds333a> If any one of you motherfuckers eventually get to the point of adding Spiral, then that shit will be insanity
[3:37:42] <marcomatame> @TopTieramisu The mo-capped animation in SFV and the physics based hair and cloth movements also contribute to the game just looking off.
[3:37:43] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff There isn't really much point isn't there?
[3:37:44] <%notsoy> so there's honestly no point to trying to do mvc2 versions of existing characters
[3:37:46] <+Azathotic> @Heefnoff Whoever did work on the model importer is a beast, I remember the early days when you could only import custom textures
[3:37:54] <Heefnoff> Don't hold your breath, that'll take years @dds333a
[3:37:55] <aveond> and Idk if storm is really worth buffing like that with the amount of new chars that fill her same niche
[3:38:02] <Heefnoff> Exactly @Shad0wTag
[3:38:03] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[3:38:06] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame yeah for sure. capcom went overboard on superfluous movements after moves
[3:38:08] <dds333a> @heefnoff don't worry, I'm not LUL
[3:38:13] <Heefnoff> @Azathotic Yeah, frankly I don't think we paid the guy enough
[3:38:18] <FrozenPockets> god this game is so fucking hype to watch
[3:38:19] <%notsoy> PJSalt
[3:38:22] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff i imagine something like black panther is possible
[3:38:23] <%SirGO0SE> You dont have the right! Kappa
[3:38:25] <+Azathotic> People just want characters with infinites in MvC3 ironmouseLUL
[3:38:27] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame and characters like sakura and cody really suffered from weaker key frames
[3:38:29] <Heefnoff> He put in so many hours as a side project and we paid him decently, but there were a lot of unexpected hurdles to overcome
[3:38:31] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff I would imagine characaters that should be in Marvel but aren't and ignored characters are the main desire
[3:38:40] <Heefnoff> @drhivesphd Probably. I'm surprised he hasn't been made yet
[3:38:42] <Super_Voltekka> M E T S U
[3:38:46] <Heefnoff> Maybe Black Panther will get made soon
[3:38:53] <BlackermanZX> Someday someone will add Servbot
[3:38:55] <dds333a> Akumacopter
[3:39:01] <+Azathotic> @drhivesphd If a animation importer ever happens, then potentially all Infinite characters can be brought in
[3:39:02] <Heefnoff> @Shad0wTag Exactly
[3:39:07] <aveond> akumacopter PogChamp
[3:39:08] <%notsoy> rashid is VJoe
[3:39:19] <drhivesphd> @azathotic monster hunter exists already so why not?
[3:39:19] <Heefnoff> We want to add characters that we feel should've been there, or that we want to see
[3:39:23] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame sometimes a snappier recovery from moves is better than putting a bunch of extra movements that don't mean anything
[3:39:33] <Heefnoff> Ah Rashid, Tabs did great work on him
[3:39:39] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff However I gotta ask, is TvC being taken into consideration?
[3:39:47] <Heefnoff> Not really @Shad0wTag
[3:39:50] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff ahhh more on making dreams come true aspect. love that
[3:39:56] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff Fair game
[3:39:58] <+Azathotic> @drhivesphd From chatting with @Heefnoff theyre doing the animations custom in-engine by splicing existing ones, so it takes WAYYYY longer to rebuild Infinite characters from scratch
[3:39:59] <Heefnoff> I haven't seen much talk of it, there's just not a lot to pull
[3:39:59] <BlackermanZX> Hobo phoenix yeyeye
[3:40:06] <Heefnoff> Correct @Azathotic
[3:40:14] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame let's hope ryu doesn't pose like a shakespearean actor after throwing a hadouken in sf6 LUL
[3:40:15] <dds333a> E. Ryu with even more Kage flavor
[3:40:18] <BlackermanZX> hobo phoenix is a puppet character right
[3:40:19] <Heefnoff> Captain Marvel, surprisingly, was a huge challenge for Tabs
[3:40:21] <Super_Voltekka> YEP GUN
[3:40:22] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff What about Alex?
[3:40:27] <Heefnoff> Correct @BlackermanZX
[3:40:36] <drhivesphd> @azathotic i watched tabs make monster hunter on stream, it was a trip
[3:40:36] <Heefnoff> Haven't seen plans of it yet but I'd personally like it @Shad0wTag
[3:40:43] <Heefnoff> If I thought I could do him justice I'd do it myself
[3:40:53] <Heefnoff> But honestly I'm a beginner when it comes to making my own stuff
[3:41:00] <%Reverend_Roscoe> omg that's  so dumb lol
[3:41:01] <BlackermanZX> oh god if someone makes Edgeworth imma be so happy LUL
[3:41:07] <Heefnoff> I promise when I make something worth showing I'll let everyone know
[3:41:07] <huskarl_zap> fuck da Knicks
[3:41:07] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff SeemsGood
[3:41:11] <+TopTieramisu> edgeworth? give me gumshoe
[3:41:13] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff I hope it's taken into consideration, grapplers in VS games are not something that happens all that often
[3:41:14] <dds333a> SCOOPS
[3:41:17] <Heefnoff> @BlackermanZX Edgeworth got imported as a modded costume
[3:41:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:41:20] <Heefnoff> Same moveset though
[3:41:22] <%townzzzzz> ooooo he got mango sentinel
[3:41:25] <huskarl_zap> HAAGEN DAAS
[3:41:30] <+Azathotic> OH SHIT I just realized the insanity if they could somehow rip character models from stage backgrounds lmao
[3:41:37] <Heefnoff> @Shad0wTag Yeah, frankly they just don't fit tag games well
[3:41:44] <BlackermanZX> Edgeworth could be cool because you can just go nuts and alter phoenix's moves
[3:41:46] <huskarl_zap> CURLY MOUSTASH
[3:41:55] <marcomatame> @TopTieramisu Super sentai movement can be funny but with such stylized characters it just ends up looking weird. Reminds me of how characters move in SA2 cutscenes
[3:41:57] <+Azathotic> Astaroth and Shadowland Daredevil
[3:42:05] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff I get it, but its nice that at least they tried with Alex
[3:42:20] <Heefnoff> True, I agree for sure @Shad0wTag
[3:42:22] <+Azathotic> Holy fuck thats a fast Demon
[3:42:24] <Heefnoff> I love that Alex was in TVC
[3:42:27] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff i adore the stage mods too, watcher and the sunset bonne island is great
[3:42:39] <Heefnoff> I just mean, these mods are also (generally) meant to explore concepts in UMVC3 we never got to see
[3:42:51] <Heefnoff> There's not really any "conventional" mod characters, they're all weirdos for one reason or another
[3:42:56] <Super_Voltekka> Here's a fun idea: How about modding in final form Apocalypse or Onslaught with Galactus as a base?
[3:43:05] <Heefnoff> @drhivesphd They're great. I wish stages were easier to work with, there's so few stage mods
[3:43:07] <+TopTieramisu> @marcomatame yeah. and the level of movement animations are very inconsistent even within sf5. some characters like menat and juri have great animations
[3:43:10] <drhivesphd> @super_voltekka lots of model work
[3:43:13] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff Either way I hope TvC is taken into consideration as Tatsunoko characters aside, I feel there's some unique Capcom characters that could work
[3:43:19] <Heefnoff> TysonCodings has been working on a great one, but he's not done yet
[3:43:26] <+Azathotic> @TopTieramisu God old SFV A Team and B Team LUL
[3:43:38] <Heefnoff> For sure, there's great inspiration to be drawn from TVC @Shad0wTag
[3:43:55] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff Is there anyone from TvC bar Alex you would like to see?
[3:44:01] <%notsoy> it crumpled because that's what it does in SF5
[3:44:03] <+TungstenoViperante> i hope someone makes a Jin Saotome mod
[3:44:05] <+TopTieramisu> i wouldn't be surprised if a majority of the character work was outsourced and the quality depended on who was hired for what character
[3:44:11] <drhivesphd> rashid is so convincing. he has deadpool idle LUL
[3:44:15] <+TungstenoViperante> maybe an Hayate one too
[3:44:23] <Heefnoff> @Shad0wTag Not sure tbh, Alex would be the main one. I'd love to see someone try and make Volnutt
[3:44:27] <Heefnoff> But that's kinda impossible rn
[3:44:37] <+TopTieramisu> it's like the boruto anime. you don't know if you're getting pure sakuga or slideshow animation
[3:44:46] <Heefnoff> So Jin Saotome is actually possible
[3:44:52] <Heefnoff> Luckily Thanos is a giant final boss
[3:45:00] <Heefnoff> And we could steal his anims lol
[3:45:04] <Heefnoff> To mimick Blodia
[3:45:06] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff Ooh good call! Volnutt would be neat call! If ever a classic Megaman is ever done, a team of all 3 Megamen would be dope
[3:45:10] <Heefnoff> Sorry I meant Galactus
[3:45:10] <dds333a> JJ is in the background of this very stage in fact, in the heli
[3:45:21] <Heefnoff> Yeah, someone made him a modded costume at some point @dds333a
[3:45:25] <Heefnoff> Same with Maya
[3:45:42] <dds333a> @heefnoff that's what I like to hear, good shit LUL <3
[3:45:50] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff jin with galactus blodia would be an inspired choice. if that could be done
[3:45:51] <%notsoy> dmc1 dante has no level 3s
[3:46:03] <Heefnoff> It's doable @drhivesphd Not sure if anyone's doing it yet
[3:46:10] <+TopTieramisu> O. Dante
[3:46:14] <Heefnoff> If I'm working on anything cool I'll let you all know lol
[3:46:36] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff im just worried the galactus arms might be too large
[3:46:38] <dds333a> @heefnoff without divulging too much. unless.... Kappa
[3:46:45] <Heefnoff> Those can be tweaked @drhivesphd
[3:46:54] <Heefnoff> @dds333a Well look if I make good progress I'll let you know
[3:47:06] <Heefnoff> I took a shot at Nero but he was frankly too tough a project for me
[3:47:10] <+Maleicus> phoenix has other supers with different buttons like taskmaster
[3:47:21] <Heefnoff> Sadly kind of impossible rn
[3:47:23] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff Ultron would be neat but he needs the drones.
[3:47:28] <+TungstenoViperante> iirc there's a free 3d jin saotome out there modeled after his MVC2 sprite
[3:47:36] <Heefnoff> So I actually think Ultron is possible @drhivesphd
[3:47:43] <Heefnoff> Not sure where he'd go
[3:47:45] <Daxalog> So Phoenix and Maya is a commander + caster?
[3:47:52] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff im listening
[3:48:01] <Heefnoff> I could see him being on top of Phoenix Wright, funny enough lol
[3:48:05] <Heefnoff> Since Maya is tied to his slot iirc
[3:48:13] <357Sneak> megana7KirbHi
[3:48:17] <Heefnoff> You would just replace Maya with a drone, or recolor her or something
[3:48:22] <dds333a> LUL
[3:48:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:48:29] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff no shot you think maya could be turned into a ultron drone LUL
[3:48:37] <Heefnoff> Funny enough, possibly? @drhivesphd
[3:48:39] <drhivesphd> thats actually genius
[3:48:44] <Heefnoff> He's honestly straightforward enough
[3:48:51] <BlackermanZX> goddamn mango sentinel
[3:48:56] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:48:59] <Heefnoff> I'll put some thought into it. Frankly I think I need to start with an easier project
[3:49:01] <+TopTieramisu> cue ultron digging in the ground for... batteries?
[3:49:07] <drhivesphd> cause his drones do different stuff too
[3:49:07] <dds333a> @blackermanzx the absolute classic
[3:49:11] <Heefnoff> I've just kinda been absorbing knowledge, haven't been able to make anything of my own yet
[3:49:21] <dds333a> @toptieramisu Pym Particles Kappa
[3:49:24] <drhivesphd> @toptieramisu he needs Vibranium LUL
[3:49:48] <+TopTieramisu> is vibranium a power source? the whole concept is weird af
[3:49:53] <+TungstenoViperante> is it possible to import animations from MVCI yet?
[3:49:56] <+TopTieramisu> it seems to do everything
[3:50:00] <Heefnoff> Nope @tungstenoviperante
[3:50:01] <dds333a> That was a great interaction
[3:50:09] <+TungstenoViperante> like, is it possible to make Venom based on MVCI?
[3:50:16] <+TungstenoViperante> @Heefnoff oh... :(
[3:50:17] <drhivesphd> @tungstenoviperante they have a model import but anims are tricky still
[3:50:18] <Heefnoff> We‚Äôd need an animation importer, that could take a couple years lol
[3:50:23] <Heefnoff> That being said
[3:50:27] <Heefnoff> We love making shit
[3:50:45] <huskarl_zap> FUUCK DA KNICKS
[3:50:45] <dds333a> LUL
[3:50:50] <+TopTieramisu> that's some chip
[3:50:59] <+TungstenoViperante> man, it would be sick having all the best thigns from MVC2 and MVCI in this
[3:51:00] <drhivesphd> they already have Thanos and monster hunter on deck. its just a matter of time
[3:51:02] <dds333a> WOW
[3:51:04] <BlackermanZX> does this pw have turnabout mode
[3:51:04] <%townzzzzz> woolieKICKDAD
[3:51:21] <drhivesphd> a animation importer would be game changing
[3:51:21] <Heefnoff> Id love to show off what the mods can do, they‚Äôre such great characters
[3:51:22] <+TopTieramisu> if you can import animations, mvc3 modding would be on another level
[3:51:28] <anuchallengertwitch> I like DMC1 Dante
[3:51:34] <Heefnoff> That would unlock basically everything @toptieramisu
[3:51:39] <+TopTieramisu> yeah
[3:51:41] <Heefnoff> At that point the only limit would be character slots
[3:51:58] <BlackermanZX> evil ryu looks perfect for this game
[3:52:01] <+TopTieramisu> fkin rashid
[3:52:03] <Azimuth_24> I'm curious as to if the modders can even get to that point
[3:52:09] <dds333a> The power of KAZE
[3:52:10] <marcomatame> With an animation importer this game would be the next Mugen
[3:52:10] <+TopTieramisu> rashid looks pretty great
[3:52:23] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff the project M of mvc3 would be the end goal?
[3:52:31] <anuchallengertwitch> I love how activating Devil trigger with Sparda increases it's attack range, just like in DMC1
[3:52:49] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch it's so cool
[3:52:49] <Heefnoff> @drhivesphd Well there‚Äôs not really an ‚Äúend goal‚Äù
[3:52:57] <%notsoy> dmc1 dante has no level 3s
[3:53:00] <Heefnoff> I think generally we just want to see UMVC3 be as much as it can be
[3:53:06] <%ZweihanderSteve> BONK
[3:53:08] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff also what would you make personally if you could
[3:53:13] <Heefnoff> There‚Äôs not gonna be a point where the last mod comes out and we all go ‚Äúyeah, we did it‚Äù
[3:53:17] <Heefnoff> If possible, Nero
[3:53:22] <dds333a> JACKPOT
[3:53:23] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a I also love how Dmc1 Dante's theme is Legendary Battle
[3:53:23] <Heefnoff> I‚Äôm a huge DMC fan
[3:53:27] <+TungstenoViperante> i must give it to the modders, this takes a lot of effort and passion to pull off. i smashed my head multiple times on some mods and elt me tell you, model imports, anim, shaders, memory limits, code editing... it's a goddamn hell
[3:53:38] <Heefnoff> But, again he‚Äôs impossible for me, and maybe impossible for Tabs as well. Way too much going on
[3:53:45] <dds333a> "looks like we have a winner" LUL
[3:53:51] <huskarl_zap> why no Boston Celtics sentinel?
[3:53:54] <Super_Voltekka> If DMC1 is in here, we should also have Nelo Angelo for Virgil just for completion's sake
[3:53:55] <Heefnoff> Tabs has been amazing @tungstenoviperante he‚Äôs made like what, 22 characters?
[3:54:03] <%AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:54:04] <Heefnoff> And they‚Äôre all finely tuned
[3:54:07] <Azimuth_24> Imagine if Capcom was smart enough to retrofit workshop support into this
[3:54:14] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff  i have a dumb idea. nero lvl 3 uses she hulk car but its the dmc5 van LUL
[3:54:17] <dds333a> He's AWARE
[3:54:20] <+TungstenoViperante> especially on an a japanese engine that uses custom extensions and spaghetti code NotLikeThis
[3:54:33] <+TopTieramisu> is there a lore reason why dante was cooler before and after dmc 1 and 2?
[3:54:39] <+TungstenoViperante> @Heefnoff he's pretty good
[3:54:46] <anuchallengertwitch> @Azimuth_24 Imagine if they added workshop mode into this game like in Rivals of aether
[3:54:55] <anuchallengertwitch> @TopTieramisu Depression
[3:54:59] <BlackermanZX> depression
[3:55:02] <dds333a> @toptieramisu what do you mean, he was cool as hell in DMC1 Kappa
[3:55:04] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, that checks out
[3:55:20] <marcomatame> anybody working on a Sol Badguy mod? if so, make sure to give him his busted close Slash from release
[3:55:21] <+TungstenoViperante> @Azimuth_24 that would requrie Japanes devs to udnertsand what Steam Workshop actually is..
[3:55:31] <drhivesphd> go maya Kappa
[3:55:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:55:33] <dds333a> Which he was, actually, but yeah, it's a difference in character that doesn't really have a lore reason, besides the anime
[3:55:37] <+TopTieramisu> when you're too sad to do hype shit
[3:55:40] <Heefnoff> Her name is Red She-Hulk lol @marcomatame
[3:55:44] <Heefnoff> That‚Äôs Sol right there
[3:55:48] <BlackermanZX> wacky wahoo pizza man was too down in the dumps
[3:55:48] <anuchallengertwitch> @TopTieramisu Dante was pretty depressed after Dmc3 and 1 because he thought the last member of his family was dead. He got  better after he found out about Nero
[3:55:49] <marcomatame> lmao
[3:55:52] <Azimuth_24> My latest modding brainstorm recently was Akatsuki
[3:56:06] <Heefnoff> From Blitzkampf? @azimuth_24
[3:56:09] <Azimuth_24> Yep
[3:56:09] <dds333a> Hell, DMC2 Dante is actually cool too, just infinitely more taciturn than literally every other game
[3:56:11] <drhivesphd> jennifer "BadGuy" Walters
[3:56:17] <Heefnoff> He‚Äôd be easy enough
[3:56:31] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a Yeah, Dmc2 Dante was just serious and less nonsense
[3:56:43] <BlackermanZX> someone has to mod DMC2 Dante and just give every button a gun followup lol
[3:56:46] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a retroactive lore changes is a-ok in my book if it answers questions like that
[3:56:47] <Azimuth_24> I'd assume so, compared to the other two I have in mind, those being Ratchet and Kratos
[3:57:05] <theredfox930000> woolie tstyNoise tstyNoise tstyNoise chrisgDance chrisgDance
[3:57:06] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff nero is definitely possible with dmc5 vergil and spencer running around
[3:57:06] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a I also remember seeing a comic where DMC2 Dante was actually Vergil from an alternate universe where he beat Dante, and took his title out of penance
[3:57:13] <+TopTieramisu> @dds333a i just meant moveset-wise. dmc2 was at his worst
[3:57:20] <Heefnoff> Nah it‚Äôs more complicated than that @drhivesphd
[3:57:26] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch woah, crazy LUL
[3:57:26] <Heefnoff> Part of it is animations
[3:57:28] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[3:57:33] <Heefnoff> Animating the demon arm would be hard as fuck
[3:57:44] <Heefnoff> And if we use the robot arm, people will expect Devil Breakers
[3:57:44] <drhivesphd> i dont deny that though @heefnoff
[3:57:49] <Heefnoff> And that‚Äôll open up a whole new problem
[3:57:58] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a Yeah, it was made a while ago before Dmc5
[3:58:07] <BlackermanZX> shadow lady
[3:58:11] <drhivesphd> X Pog
[3:58:14] <dds333a> @toptieramisu he sure was, moveset was seriously lacking, but at least DMC2 introduced Gunslinger tech and Rebellion
[3:58:30] <%notsoy> shin akuma lmao
[3:58:37] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder what hideki kamiya thinks about the dante his team created retroactively being dante at his worst emotionally LUL
[3:58:40] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a and Trickster wall running
[3:58:51] <BlackermanZX> Shin akoomer
[3:59:04] <+TopTieramisu> though i guess 2 was in a lower state
[3:59:04] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch thank you so much, I was racking my brain thinking of it LUL
[3:59:22] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff ive also seen a lot of love for a potential Asura he seems to be a big crowd pleaser
[3:59:34] <Heefnoff> Asura would be very fun @drhivesphd
[3:59:36] <anuchallengertwitch> Shadow Lady is so cool despite (or because of) her being so vauge lore wise. Like all we know about her is she's a robot chun li, but she's still cool
[3:59:39] <BlackermanZX> UNLESS
[3:59:40] <Heefnoff> Someone theorized a moveset for him
[3:59:46] <Heefnoff> Even what animations to pull from
[3:59:46] <drhivesphd> and theres monster hunter!
[3:59:52] <Azimuth_24> Asura I fail to see how he's still not in a Vs game
[3:59:53] <Heefnoff> There are some limits, but hey it could be done
[4:00:01] <%notsoy> asura would be what, hulk buttons + fireballs?
[4:00:02] <357Sneak> yapicoJAMMIN
[4:00:03] <+TopTieramisu> asura would be dope
[4:00:10] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff have you seen thorgi arcade's build the roster?
[4:00:11] <dds333a> @anuchallengertwitch Shadow Lady being just Satanic Chun-li is always great
[4:00:16] <Heefnoff> A lot of hulk anime yeah @notsoy
[4:00:24] <BlackermanZX> SourPls
[4:00:27] <KinduVborrd> Goddamn this looks fun
[4:00:30] <Heefnoff> Not sure, I‚Äôll check it out @drhivesphd
[4:00:35] <dds333a> BIONIC ARM
[4:00:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> why chun li look like that?
[4:00:47] <drhivesphd> @heefnoff he had a 2 parter for mvc
[4:00:52] <dds333a> @reverend_roscoe it's a reference
[4:00:54] <+TopTieramisu> shadow lady was just capcom filling out a spot
[4:01:00] <Heefnoff> I‚Äôll check it out @drhivesphd
[4:01:02] <+TopTieramisu> same with shadow
[4:01:03] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a I kind of wish fighting game crossovers did that more often, just make random overpowered versions of pre existing characters. Like Giga Bowser, Cyborg Akuma, or God Rugal
[4:01:03] <Heefnoff> Could help
[4:01:05] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @dds333a ah ok
[4:01:20] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Thats wild
[4:01:23] <+TopTieramisu> god rugal is the best iteration of rugal
[4:01:26] <dds333a> This mod turns the ref into an actual character
[4:01:35] <drhivesphd> watcher in the back is a cool detail
[4:01:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> is there a zubaz mod yet?
[4:01:38] <anuchallengertwitch> @TopTieramisu Fucking chucks Akuma's body offscreen like a G
[4:01:43] <BlackermanZX> im glad someone gave X cooler moves
[4:01:49] <drhivesphd> also the guardians ship
[4:01:51] <Who_lio42> the only character ive ever sefilishly wanted for Marvel is Gene the Godhand
[4:01:53] <Azimuth_24> @dds333a I also wish they wouldn't put them behind a paywall, such as Avatar Belial being yet another version of a character you already have to pay for
[4:02:26] <Heefnoff> Funny you mention that @who_lio42
[4:02:31] <Heefnoff> I‚Äôm not gonna say Gene is coming out
[4:02:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[4:02:33] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a Yeah that sucks. I just mean making characters like that in general.
[4:02:43] <Heefnoff> But I WILL say people were talking about him
[4:02:49] <drhivesphd> hey chat, one marvel and one capcom, who you got
[4:02:52] <Azimuth_24> Lemme guess, yet another character tabs or someone else is working on Gene?
[4:03:06] <%Shad0wTag> Give me Moon Knight and Asura
[4:03:07] <Azimuth_24> ah
[4:03:18] <Who_lio42> @Heefnoff thats cool to hear.
[4:03:19] <BlackermanZX> pretty sure Moon Knight is coming
[4:03:22] <%Shad0wTag> Those are my picks
[4:03:23] <%notsoy> @drhivesphd Nero for sure, idk about marvel...
[4:03:29] <Heefnoff> Moon Knight exists
[4:03:30] <anuchallengertwitch> Does Shadow Lady have custom quotes?
[4:03:34] <Heefnoff> But he‚Äôs not even close to done yet
[4:03:37] <dds333a> @azimuth_24 completely agreed, which is why @anuchallengertwitch has the right idea with just making them insane secret characters or bosses
[4:03:39] <%townzzzzz> THAT CHIP DAMAGE
[4:03:41] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff OH I HAD NO IDEA
[4:03:44] <Heefnoff> Frankly he‚Äôs a bit of a mess right now, no disrespect to the author
[4:03:59] <+Maleicus> a beautiful mess
[4:04:05] <drhivesphd> Asura and nightcrawler would be my choice
[4:04:06] <Heefnoff> A beautiful mess indeed
[4:04:11] <Heefnoff> I hope the author keeps working on them
[4:04:16] <Heefnoff> Cause there‚Äôs a lot of great stuff there
[4:04:21] <drhivesphd> its a crime nightcrawler never made it to mvc
[4:04:29] <Azimuth_24> I also recount tabs taking issue with the general lack of dual wielding anims when working on MH
[4:04:30] <Heefnoff> Night crawler would be a great fit
[4:04:32] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:04:36] <+Azathotic> I could see Moon Knight easily from existing animations, like Taskmaster
[4:04:39] <Heefnoff> Yes, that‚Äôs correct @azimuth_24
[4:04:44] <anuchallengertwitch> @dds333a Imagine Dual weilding Masamune and Yamato Vergil being a boss character, or hell, Satsui No Hado Thanos being a boss character ala Shin Akuma
[4:05:01] <drhivesphd> im curious what does moon knight even do powers wise?
[4:05:13] <%notsoy> sin DT needs to be in a fighting game ASAP
[4:05:17] <Heefnoff> Batman stuff? Idk @drhivesphd
[4:05:19] <dds333a> Moon Knight is like Batman
[4:05:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @drhivesphd be crazy and cuss out Dracula
[4:05:28] <anuchallengertwitch> @drhivesphd basically gadgets in stuff, with the occasional eldrithc egypt god magic I think
[4:05:30] <+Azathotic> @drhivesphd Batman gadgets but also guns and rarely supernatural shit
[4:05:34] <dds333a> But he DOES have mystical powers too LUL
[4:05:41] <+Azathotic> But mostly Batman gadgets and punching
[4:05:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> seeing all these characters together gives me warm, nostalgic feelings woolieGASM
[4:05:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I've watched so many WoolieVs streams that I'll never not hear that menu music as anything other than a beer commercial
[4:05:59] <dds333a> Marc can like teleport under the moon and shit. and he can communicate with Konsu for mystical insight
[4:06:00] <drhivesphd> brb gonna go look at moon knights's power basr
[4:06:07] <BlackermanZX> Moon Knight needs the Random Bullshit go move
[4:06:22] <+Azathotic> @BlackermanZX So... Hsien-Ko?
[4:06:24] <dds333a> @blackermanzx LUL LUL
[4:07:18] <Heefnoff> Man, I‚Äôd love to run a FT3 with Woolie/Reggie to show off what these mod characters can do
[4:07:29] <Heefnoff> They‚Äôre so crazy, I love them. I really appreciate them checking the mods out
[4:07:37] <dds333a> LUL
[4:07:55] <$ggbhtg> I've been gone for an hour, so they're NOT jumping on Parsec?
[4:08:14] <dds333a> Still active Kappa
[4:08:15] <Heefnoff> I assume not @ggbhtg
[4:08:29] <%Shad0wTag> @ggbhtg Nah they haven't in the past for modded sessions
[4:08:34] <Heefnoff> Though I hope they do, I gotta represent the modding scene in battle iheart4Bless
[4:08:39] <%Reverend_Roscoe> holy shit
[4:08:40] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:08:41] <%AngryAsian5> LUL

[4:08:53] <%townzzzzz> YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVIL'S POWER
[4:08:54] <+Azathotic> Does Woolie have the DMCV Vergil mod installed?
[4:08:55] <Heefnoff> Not just modders, we‚Äôre good players too lol
[4:08:55] <jimgimp> gg

[4:09:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> again, this song will only ever be a beer commercial for me
[4:09:26] <Super_Voltekka> Tron Bonne into PTX
[4:09:29] <drhivesphd> so i looked up moon knights powers and oh boy @heefnoff its a doozy. mental power, immortality, super strength, necromancy and a bunch of other crazy stuff
[4:09:29] <$ggbhtg> .....WHEN'S PARSEC, COWARDS?!
[4:09:31] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus TvC characters! Like Alex or Karas?
[4:09:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:09:44] <BlackermanZX> whens Parsec tho
[4:09:44] <Heefnoff> So
[4:09:46] <+TopTieramisu> mental power? is that like psychic power?
[4:09:49] <+TungstenoViperante> There's Hayato in Tatsunoko VS Capcom?
[4:09:52] <Heefnoff> You can splice animations together
[4:09:53] <%ZweihanderSteve> When do we start slapping in tatsunoko characters
[4:10:00] <Heefnoff> But you CANNOT add brand new animations
[4:10:01] <BlackermanZX> oh god Karas would be so damn sick
[4:10:04] <$ggbhtg> That's 2 streams of locals now, WHEN'S Parsec?
[4:10:06] <dds333a> @toptieramisu sometimes not LUL
[4:10:08] <%Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu man is clinically insane
[4:10:09] <Heefnoff> Tabs is just a genius at splicing animus
[4:10:12] <Heefnoff> Anims*
[4:10:26] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu so you're saying insanity is a superpower? LUL
[4:10:27] <drhivesphd> @toptieramisu total control of his mind basically he uses 100% of his brain also divine moon god power
[4:10:40] <+TopTieramisu> oh god, not the 100% of your brain crap
[4:10:41] <BlackermanZX> i hope someday they will be able to import animations
[4:10:43] <Heefnoff> We‚Äôve just been sticking to Marvel and Capcom Woolie, no worries
[4:10:46] <%Shad0wTag> Keep it in theme for sure!
[4:10:48] <Heefnoff> We kind of just don‚Äôt want to be Mugen
[4:10:49] <+Azathotic> Moon Knight has magical mental illness, not regular disorders
[4:10:52] <+TungstenoViperante> Alex too
[4:10:55] <Heefnoff> At least not yet. So, don‚Äôt worry about it
[4:10:56] <+cubbywolf> no goku no buy ku
[4:10:58] <+TopTieramisu> everybody uses 100% of their brain, just not all at once
[4:11:04] <dds333a> @toptieramisu Got LimitLucy'd Kappa
[4:11:12] <Heefnoff> Model Importer was a huge help
[4:11:19] <Heefnoff> I‚Äôm glad so many people checked out mods after that
[4:11:23] <$ggbhtg> Many props, massive ups, everything is based
[4:11:29] <drhivesphd> animation importer would be nutty
[4:11:35] <Heefnoff> There‚Äôs two big hurdles left: Adding new character slots, and adding new animations
[4:11:42] <+TungstenoViperante> a complete modded Pack with ALL the modded characters
[4:11:45] <dds333a> MVC3: Rainbow Edition
[4:11:46] <Heefnoff> Honestly Woolie I‚Äôm worried about making a tournament version
[4:12:01] <Heefnoff> One, there would be disagreements. Two, we don‚Äôt want Capcom or Disney fucking with us
[4:12:01] <+Azathotic> Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom Project M
[4:12:03] <+TungstenoViperante> Capcom would be happy :)
[4:12:05] <drhivesphd> UMVC3: Uncanny Edition
[4:12:27] <+cubbywolf> I'm just hear to backseat game
[4:12:28] <drhivesphd> Disney monkaS
[4:12:32] <+cubbywolf> here
[4:12:37] <+Goku01899> Capcom hates grassroot events
[4:12:41] <+Azathotic> @Heefnoff Take Woolie's advice and just drop it when it's finished and then the takedowns wont matter cause its in the wild
[4:12:51] <+TungstenoViperante> Maximum Marvel VS Capcom 3
[4:12:56] <+Azathotic> aka The AM2R approach
[4:12:59] <+TopTieramisu> capcom wants to be riot. but the FGC isn't LoL tier

[4:14:20] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> A_DEAD_SHOW subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey woolie, just to add to the GRRM spite, Brandon sanderson announced he made 5 extra books on 2 years (on top of the ones he already publushed) just recently, cause he is full of elden ring spite

[4:14:41] <+TopTieramisu> i hope brandon sanderson is enjoying elden ring :)
[4:15:02] <dds333a> LUL
[4:15:03] <+TopTieramisu> i don't believe that sanderson is actually that salty about grrm's involvement. i think it's just banter

[4:15:47] <BlackermanZX> its almost impossible really
[4:15:48] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> it was just a little sillyness
[4:15:52] <dds333a> Ayyy, Pre-recorded eps?
[4:16:05] <BlackermanZX> OH ITS BIG

[4:18:18] <+cubbywolf> I meant the people
[4:18:23] <+cubbywolf> use the people
[4:18:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> OP Jellyfish PogChamp
[4:18:32] <huskarl_zap> use a fast bleed weapon

[4:20:03] <Heefnoff> Nah there's no downplay lol
[4:20:05] <+TopTieramisu> there's literally a guy you talk to before fighting a boss that goes "here's the boss' backstory btw" and you go into a cutscene
[4:20:10] <%Shad0wTag> It was on the podcast
