[0:14:19] <Scova_> omega fucked LUL
[0:14:19] <Personified134> American schools get plenty of that stuff, that *particular* one just doesn't come up specifically
[0:14:20] <Solidnick18> got it
[0:14:23] <siamzero94> What problem?
[0:14:24] <Camail> there are a lot of awful things in the south
[0:14:25] <+Redx2213> Nope you know damn well they won’t tell us nothing lol @woolieversus
[0:14:27] <%jinking79> Blame Plague
[0:14:27] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus you think murican schools teach anything about black history? lol
[0:14:28] <%voodoolawyer> @WoolieVersus The extent of black history we learn about in American schools is such: Who MLK is, who Rosa Parks is, what cotton is, how cotton is picked, things cotton can be used for ...
[0:14:29] <ssgsorrels> woolz, slavery ended in 1800s
[0:14:30] <rearedlogarithm> I didn’t find out about Tulsa until my late twenties.
[0:14:30] <+NotHereToStream> history is fucked
[0:14:31] <+eanscrale> Yeah maybe dabbing is not the best comparison
[0:14:31] <+feiashtear> Welcome to Black History Month
[0:14:31] <%DatAsuna> tl;dr texas basically dictates what textbooks everyone else gets
[0:14:33] <1matheuw> is that why you are so tired woolie?

[0:14:48] <+Zagreus> That is honestly the most fucked title I have ever read, and I love that you do this
[0:14:48] <Solidnick18> oh noooo

[0:15:17] <AnthonyJMax> woolie should teach a class
[0:15:19] <siamzero94> What did they talk about?
[0:15:21] <Nested_Dreams> Sadly, suffering is the best way to learn
[0:15:21] <cheesedburgers> MLK talked about how much he wanted to do peaceful things and the fbi is super cool and that’s basically black history in American school
[0:15:23] <zamzoph> WOOLIE IS KEVIN SPACEY
[0:15:24] <%jinking79> ppl on their Phones everyday never check on their history
[0:15:26] <AnthroMetal> PROFESSOR WOOLIE

[0:15:40] <%TheBesteban> Woolie Vs History
[0:15:43] <GrimEnigma> tbh, you really expect the system that commited the crimes to educate people on who they commited crimes on people?
[0:15:44] <%tearfuldevil> we are the hivemind
[0:15:44] <%RioGascar> Mlk and rosa parks are the ones we get taught in American education system
[0:15:44] <+Ultimate_Edge> Woolie Vs AmericanHistory

[0:18:59] <ThatGuyThere03> bruh don't start with busses
[0:18:59] <+Neoepochx> On a positive note, Woolz you made a comment anout Kotor and how History repeats itself in the Star Wars universe. Kotor 2 is basically Avellone's commentary on that
[0:18:59] <+Zagreus> Are we on the back of the bus?

[0:19:52] <%voodoolawyer> Emmet Till was a 13 year old who was lynched viciously by a bunch of white people for whistling at a white woman. This was in the ... 60s? On her death bed, in the mid 2000s? That white woman admitted she lied because she didn't like the black kid.
[0:19:52] <%GinAndRoses> people gonna tune into that episode, up the price!
[0:19:56] <%Sparkseid> LUL sbfpSetIn

[0:25:47] <turbofolk> I learned about emmet till today, my boy was trying to up his game and he got blasted
[0:25:49] <+GodsAndHumans> Last time I played DOOM 2016 the screen was about the 6.66 update lmao
[0:25:50] <%voodoolawyer> Is this a Mobile Game??
[0:25:50] <AnthroMetal> it used to be so simple
[0:25:54] <Ner234> TrumpetSkele
[0:25:54] <%realm_forge> There used to be some crazy shit. Arcade mode was awesome
[0:25:57] <%Ashenik1> Doot doot doooouoot dooot doot
[0:26:00] <AnthroMetal> god i hate tiles for menus
[0:26:25] <%Javaa01> Arcade Mode is still in the game, it's just under the menu once you load your save
[0:26:30] <zamzoph> Who wins: DOOD Eteete or MOOM Lanrrnal
[0:26:31] <cheesedburgers> This looks like a digital store not a menu
[0:26:36] <%Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus youhave to see the video on r/Doom just type doot
[0:26:42] <Solidnick18> Final Doot

[0:26:49] <ssgsorrels> map editor
[0:26:49] <%SilverInferno3> Seriously though, Arcade Mode is just the game with a style meter and its the best
[0:26:51] <%Javaa01> Snapmap is kind of a lame level editor
[0:26:52] <%realm_forge> @javaa01 holy shit I missed that

[0:33:41] <%SilverInferno3> UGH
[0:33:56] <rearedlogarithm> That’s the bossest of fountains.
[0:33:57] <%SilverInferno3> That challenge

[0:34:06] <+karldeck> How many levels until Woolie is done?
[0:34:07] <+chiluzza> the first one is actually the easiest
[0:34:19] <+hoenhime344> gun not being centered is killing me lmao
[0:34:21] <+Neoepochx> You can only finish it off with a charged pistol shot though
[0:34:24] <siamzero94> @karldeck with this is should be 3
[0:34:25] <fist_wizard_jay> Like, two or three levels left?
[0:34:29] <%Javaa01> This map is kind of a soft reference to Tricks and Traps from Doom 2
[0:34:39] <xxHungryxx> I wonder if Doomguy pays his taxes
[0:34:41] <%SilverInferno3> Unless you're like me and had that rune equipped that changed how stagger works and fucks you
[0:34:48] <+karldeck> @siamzero94 Hopefully Woolie do another 8 hour stream if needed
[0:34:59] <doomslayerdt> Turn up the FOV if you wanna get high

[0:35:18] <@Solidus_113> RIP AND TEAR
[0:35:23] <+Neoepochx> @silverinferno3 Yeah, the one where it staggers earlier will cause problems. you need the one that makes staggers longer, so you have time to charge the pistol
[0:35:24] <@Solidus_113> STARTING STRONG
[0:35:29] <siamzero94> @karldeck oh next level is more straightfoward than this, so it should be possible today

[0:43:47] <+BNPhone> NTR s a sin
[0:43:48] <%tearfuldevil> traitor demon, i think?
[0:43:51] <+desfore> NTR is Reggies favorite tag, confirmed
[0:43:51] <Hawkbone_> Yes, but the wretch is a different thing, its a demon
[0:43:52] <Ahk_90> you don't want to know
[0:43:55] <1matheuw> he defeated the titan BEFORE getting the armor
[0:43:55] <unit24> dead simple hype
[0:43:55] <Halospaz117> I believe it's a demon who was like "Yo, you're hype" and made Doom Slayer the armor

[0:56:15] <fist_wizard_jay> Teal-Guy stole Reggie’s soul
[0:56:27] <+BNPhone> not canon

[0:56:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> I NEED MORE POWER
[0:56:29] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> @squdnate I wish
[0:56:30] <awalr> barfing into the void
[0:56:30] <hassanico2> @bubbli97 according to schedule seems like it
[0:56:31] <Solidnick18> but they are demons
[0:56:32] <Haarute> can you turn up the difficulty mid game?
[0:56:34] <%DensityD> that's why people do doom2016 challenge runs
[0:56:36] <Zebroneath> Is Woolie secretly a demon sympathizer?

[0:58:12] <siamzero94> my money's on manc
[0:58:20] <%Irridium> after the fight
