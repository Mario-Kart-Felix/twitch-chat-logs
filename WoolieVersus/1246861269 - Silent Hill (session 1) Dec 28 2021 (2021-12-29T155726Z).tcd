[0:02:15] <Solidnick18> i pretty much got all my christmas stuff early.
[0:02:18] <silentshrug> We'll have boxing day when we adopt the metric system
[0:02:23] <%Indigo_Automaton> Black Friday deals are also mostly scams
[0:02:30] <Josef_Stryker> I mean it's nice for people who wanna break in the gift cards they got
[0:02:37] <conchthechimera> Boxing day was the day after Christmas for servants and working class folks to have "their" christmas IIRC
[0:02:38] <hereiam407> Whats a metric? How many feet is that?
[0:02:39] <Solidnick18> hurts alot of things...
[0:02:53] <arkv01> you don't understand, americans literally cannot adopt the metric system because their nukes are coded to imperial
[0:02:54] <those_bananas> it's omicron now

[0:04:08] <%Vigonept> yeah no taxes!
[0:04:08] <JoshManVGH> When we had a seasonal boardgame store in my town, I celebrated boxing day. Would head their first thing in the morning on the 26th to pick up a game at ridiculous liquidation prices.
[0:04:14] <@Menitta> the one I got was too light
[0:04:21] <%leith_aziz> @Menitta As long as it works I guess

[0:09:25] <@Menitta> I don't think it's worse than 3 but....it's not great

[0:09:34] <+solzan2000> I don't know why that film exists lol
[0:09:34] <+TopTieramisu> pat was shitting on nioh 2?
[0:09:35] <+Birdigalore> Is it a sequel to 3 or it's own thing?
[0:09:40] <%diegobandzz> I think they made it bad on purpose
[0:09:44] <+BananaSlammuh> Sequel
[0:09:48] <andre11dr> Out off all the movies that came out, the new Matrix movie was definitely one of them
[0:09:49] <%Vigonept> its wild how different peoples opinions can be
[0:09:51] <+kewlmyc> People like different shit. Weird how people can't seem to understand this on the internet.

[0:09:56] <zecht89> HeyGuys
[0:09:57] <Lunalios> haven't seen it but the trailers were very cringe, reminding us of the first movie with footage from the first movie spliced over trailer footage
[0:10:00] <+solzan2000> oh thats right $$$ lol
[0:10:01] <+Jiggisnipe> @TopTieramisu he really hated garbage drops and something with the stats

[0:11:17] <derap41> Keanu isn't a good actor but he's a genuine actor
[0:11:17] <+BananaSlammuh> I thought Carie Anne Moss did a good job acting wise
[0:11:20] <%diegobandzz> That one person they aged up was the worst
[0:11:27] <@Menitta> It had like....some comedy? it wasn't funny that's for sure
[0:11:30] <+kewlmyc> I actually liked the meta stuff. It was the most interesting part of the movie, until it wasn't.
[0:11:31] <%leith_aziz> My taste in things is weird when it comes to liking some games' plot. I havent watched many movies to talk about stuff like this
[0:11:32] <kes009900> it was a very awkward movie to say the least...
[0:11:37] <NeonBleu> You got Marvel in my Matrix
[0:11:39] <Camo_boy67> @kewlmyc thank you, I figured, but I was unsure. I didn’t know if woolie did premium only content.
[0:11:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> missed opportunities bug me
[0:11:43] <+Jasek7> when Jada came on screen I noped
[0:11:45] <shotguncrucifix> virgin neo vs handsome chad
[0:11:45] <Grim1952> It had ideas, they just went nowhere and the action was boring
[0:11:47] <brunoberserk> is the curse of the post - MCU blockbuster movies : too many jokes NotLikeThis
[0:11:49] <hereiam407> Matrix Path of Neo was alright
[0:11:50] <+solzan2000> and am not a fan of jada
[0:11:55] <+Birdigalore> The Matrix stops at 1, Terminator stops at 2
[0:12:02] <Hozak> It sucks how the original idea was that the first movie in the triology was going to be three movies. But when the studio wasn't going to go for three movies originally the watchowski's had to cram it all into one film.
[0:12:06] <Johannen> They aged up Keanu cause he is immortal and never ages in real life?
[0:12:08] <terry_irvin> TELL EM WOOLIE
[0:12:08] <+kewlmyc> MMO being canon will never not be hilarious
[0:12:09] <@Menitta> the editing of those fight scenes were terrible
[0:12:10] <dundore77> yeah the fight scenes were trash in this one
[0:12:12] <%diegobandzz> It’s like they told her to imagine what an old person is like
[0:12:13] <%dds333a> whic his insane
[0:12:15] <miucsa51> this movie was made to retain the right
[0:12:16] <derap41> Would the world have been a better place if the movie was never made?
[0:12:17] <%Vigonept> didnt echo saynot to defend yer point?
[0:12:22] <%leith_aziz> It's nice that chat and Woolie can actually talk about this without turning into a hell-hole like in some chats
[0:12:24] <emMmDeeKay> dammit Matrix Stans stalling our Silent HIll day
[0:12:28] <%diegobandzz> Also fuck the editing
[0:12:29] <Lunalios> a lot of 80s and 90s franchises suck ass after their 1st or 2nd film
[0:12:31] <+TopTieramisu> terminator stops at the universal studios ride
[0:12:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:12:33] <+Orbital_Zero> just seems like they're riding on nostalgia like other movies these days
[0:12:36] <peachy996> @brunoberserk not just movies.
[0:12:45] <derap41> Technical Solutions instead of Technology solutions
[0:12:46] <%diegobandzz> Whoever edited those fights were ass
[0:12:53] <+solzan2000> money grab movie
[0:12:55] <+Orbital_Zero> but I'll still watch it myself before saying anything
[0:13:01] <ohkayNiko> i agree 1000% Woolie, this movie just did not capture the essence of what made the original trilogy so amazing. there's a reason movies around that time copied some of what the matrix did
[0:13:01] <shotguncrucifix> the camera work sucked too very shaky like a Bourne movie
[0:13:01] <hereiam407> Matrix and Silent Hill 1? Released in the same year
[0:13:02] <dundore77> id say this is the first matrix sequel where the story was the high point, and its not really that high.
[0:13:02] <emMmDeeKay> Matrix Resurrections is an intentionally made bad Force Awakens.
[0:13:03] <lehvak182> I agree, Matrix 4 was hard for me to sit through because of the drop in quality
[0:13:06] <ohkayNiko> this movie missed all that
[0:13:11] <peachy996> Sati shows up?
[0:13:11] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie! Ggs on the Dark Souls LP you guys did great!  Quick q for Woolie, do you think you'll go back and give Mirrors Edge Catalyst a shot? I played it again on the Series X recently and I enjoyed it way more with the framerate boost!
[0:13:15] <dukenux> lmao im getting a Matrix ad rn
[0:13:22] <%dds333a> @ohkayniko and by trilogy, really only the first film LUL LUL LUL
[0:13:26] <hereiam407> This is like an anti-ad
[0:13:27] <%RickyRelucent> @lunalios u say that like the the shit sequals are frim the same years
[0:13:30] <Grim1952> And everytime they copied a move from the original but worse it was frustrating
[0:13:34] <emMmDeeKay> it was obvious that the good stuff from the Matrix came from the OTHER Watchowski sister
[0:13:36] <+SerialSins> just bad choreography
[0:13:39] <ohkayNiko> @dds333a yeah exactly LUL LUL
[0:13:42] <derap41> Hiding bad choreography with lots of cuts
[0:13:43] <dukenux> Sati is back ye
[0:13:45] <@Solidus_113> the WS anderson problem
[0:13:46] <andre11dr> My problem with Matrix 4 is that it's not bad in a cringe funny way, it was just mediocre and boring
[0:13:47] <brunoberserk> classic warner movies, too many cuts
[0:13:48] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:13:48] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[0:13:49] <@Menitta> Im not a fan of a lot of the fighting in 2 and 3 they all felt weightless. this had the opposite problem of the Taken 3 constant cutting so you have no clue what's happening on top of bad choreography
[0:13:49] <%leith_aziz> Like CW action?
[0:13:51] <xerotwo> like Arrow? LUL
[0:13:57] <+Orbital_Zero> was the story cool at least?
[0:13:59] <shieldecho> I only watched the first Matrix for the first time a few months ago and then didn't watch 2 and 3 before watching 4, so my ignorant ass liked 4 well enough
[0:14:00] <Solidnick18> Oh
[0:14:00] <peachy996> Like Daredevil fighting
[0:14:00] <%diegobandzz> Also wtf exactly is that manta ray ?
[0:14:01] <%leith_aziz> With teh shaky cam etc
[0:14:09] <lehvak182> @WoolieVersus it felt like a CW adaptation of the Matrix
[0:14:11] <+eanscrale> quick editing, a lot of camera movement to obscure that no one knows that they are doing
[0:14:13] <dukenux> It's Taken style "death by 1000 cuts"
[0:14:13] <arkv01> the story was predictable and mediocre
[0:14:13] <andre11dr> Iron Fist levels of choreography
[0:14:13] <+CrisLeFortL> CW core
[0:14:14] <terry_irvin> CW FIGHTING YES
[0:14:15] <peachy996> Oh NO!!! Kingpin is going to charge Matt Murdock for the 100th time
[0:14:22] <@Menitta> it felt like an OVA to me
[0:14:25] <sirjames079> Guess I'll still just stick to Tokusatsu for my good action needs then
[0:14:28] <Grim1952> It's a bad copy
[0:14:32] <emMmDeeKay> I want the Lilly Watchowski CUT kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg
[0:14:36] <+BananaSlammuh> And Neo’s lame forcefield stuff
[0:14:36] <%MTLer> MTLer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! happy holidays thirtyhitcheapz and Chester01
[0:14:37] <derap41> So the world would be better if this movie was never made?
[0:14:39] <GodGoshDarnIt> its almost like nobody wanted another Matrix and yet its here
[0:14:40] <hereiam407> Same movie, different brains
[0:14:44] <%FallenAngelZelos> We're still talking about the Matrix?
[0:14:45] <ohkayNiko> they didn't even get Neo right
[0:14:47] <%diegobandzz> Their version of bullet time was also ass
[0:14:49] <shotguncrucifix> john wick makes it feel so much worse by comparison bc the camera work is better and the fights are better and it's impossible to separate them in my mind
[0:14:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> watched two different movies, both were bad Kappa
[0:14:58] <%leith_aziz> I wonder what people who never saw Matrix thought about the movie?
[0:15:05] <%leith_aziz> That would be an interesting perspective
[0:15:07] <peachy996> Some of the best Zion Invasions Kappa
[0:15:07] <derap41> ...Well the first one was
[0:15:08] <%RickyRelucent> @cerap, no but the franchise? arguably
[0:15:12] <hereiam407> Want some Matrix action, go watch Malignant
[0:15:15] <ohkayNiko> in the original it wasn't a force field, he was literally changing physics.
[0:15:18] <arkv01> neo was a lame duck in matrix 4 after knowing what keanu did in john wick
[0:15:20] <+ikantreeed> What's the correlation betwen matrix and silent hill?
[0:15:24] <PartialRecall1> this was only one wachowski not both
[0:15:27] <JoshManVGH> @hereiam407 Holy crap you're right! Silent Hill came out in NA Feb 1999, Matrix came out March 1999!
[0:15:30] <peachy996> You what I love about Revolutions? How every minute is about ZionZionZion
[0:15:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Are we gonna bet on boss fights like we did with Dark Souls? Because I'm super down for it.
[0:15:32] <hereiam407> @ikantreeed They were released the same year
[0:15:32] <derap41> Deos neo gets it up the butt?
[0:15:37] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz I'd say no because the new movie is pretty boring most of the time
[0:15:37] <hereiam407> LUL

[0:15:41] <+Jiggisnipe> yea it was the Wachowski not both
[0:15:43] <crudjandall> hello everyone!
[0:15:47] <Chatterbox1991> To be fair, they might not have the budget for the kind of Matrix movie they had before; Matrix 1 through 3 were the most expensive movies ever.
[0:15:52] <%RickyRelucent> "if u gotta ask" - sun tzu

[0:15:56] <crudjandall> happy to see you streaming
[0:16:01] <Gelphaze> Silent hill? well at least woolie is keeping it fresh.
[0:16:02] <Blank9> Matrix just keeps up the downhill trend, like usual
[0:16:02] <emMmDeeKay> MATRIX: THE OBLIGATION
[0:16:11] <%dds333a> @joshmanvgh yeah, dude LUL
[0:16:11] <xerotwo> Pat needs to watch it then LUL
[0:16:15] <+Shady_Zaku> @rytyoung Ayoooo!! doodShake premierKanpai premierKanpai
[0:16:19] <hereiam407> MATRIX: PAY THE BILLS
[0:16:19] <+SerialSins> @hereiam407 I'll find it on the high seas then
[0:16:23] <+Jiggisnipe> Pat might watch it cause he's curious
[0:16:23] <+Shady_Zaku> !uptime
[0:16:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> ruined
[0:16:23] <@Moobot> @Shady_Zaku WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 32 minutes and 34 seconds
[0:16:27] <arkv01> matrix tiktok cut
[0:16:31] <%MTLer> watched it, meh
[0:16:34] <Lunalios> @rickyrelucent what do you mean? maybe I should've been broader saying a lot of general franchises suck ass cuz it's clear the first was good because it's a provocative concept piece and the rest were made after the fact mostly for money.
[0:16:37] <+Shady_Zaku> Okay I'm not that late lol phew
[0:16:38] <@Menitta> The first Matrix had higher budget in effects but what that movie did in 99 is significantly cheaper to do now
[0:16:38] <%jonblnt> I see what you’re saying. It was better than my mid expectations so I enjoyed it,
[0:16:40] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:16:42] <%FallenAngelZelos> FallenAngelZelos gifted a Tier 1 sub to GeneralSCPatton! 
[0:16:44] <derap41> I'm gonna watch it out of spite
[0:16:46] <%baka_sugoi> its okay
[0:16:47] <dundore77> the concept is cool i really liked the story and what they did with it but yeah fights and score really was not to matrix levels
[0:16:47] <shotguncrucifix> it's better than Matrix Revolutions
[0:16:47] <+Shady_Zaku> Soooo, we doin Silent Hill huh??
[0:16:48] <JoshManVGH> @dds333a Uuuugh, it's setting in!
[0:16:51] <emMmDeeKay> @Chatterbox1991 there are cheap movies that at least have competent choreography
[0:16:51] <Solidnick18> i watched something else
[0:16:54] <puluxor> Everybody has played Silent Hill- oh wait hggLul
[0:16:54] <HarshNerf> i just skipped it EZ
[0:16:54] <%leith_aziz> Im a guy who knows about the plot of Matrix and why people love those movies, AT the same time, I've never watched them myself
[0:16:59] <crudjandall> the only thing that makes me almost as excited as Reggie vs DS2 is anything involving Silent Hill
[0:17:00] <+10deez> The Matrix and Silent Hill have a shared universe
[0:17:03] <hereiam407> Spanish guitar slowly fades in
[0:17:07] <@Menitta> Matrix 1 for a long time was my favorite movie so I had to see it.
[0:17:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> They changed philosophy 101 forever
[0:17:10] <tanarath> @chatterbox1991 but they don't need to invent new tech, this is 20-year old tech. If anything, they would want to make something like the latest bill & ted.
[0:17:12] <nochejunior> expectations are in hell
[0:17:12] <emMmDeeKay> A GOOD score isn't expensive
[0:17:13] <Solidnick18> Matrix path of neo still a great game.
[0:17:14] <+TopTieramisu> oof
[0:17:15] <xerotwo> O O F
[0:17:17] <peachy996> That's such a Hollywood line
[0:17:18] <Lunalios> DID YOU CLAP?
[0:17:20] <dukenux> i hope Pat gonna watch it this week so you gyys can go full new year's spoilercast
[0:17:20] <Grim1952> I went with that attitude and it was pretty much what i expected but also boring
[0:17:24] <%baka_sugoi> oof
[0:17:30] <+Jasek7> I clapped when he said it
[0:17:31] <%RickyRelucent> i liked the gamws, the path of neo and the one with ghost naomi and the vs mode
[0:17:31] <dukenux> PUNCHline huh
[0:17:32] <peachy996> Hollywood and MCU are degrading the quality of movies
[0:17:34] <yukichocomilk> I hate that kinda garbage
[0:17:36] <peachy996> and shows
[0:17:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> 20 year callback
[0:17:36] <xerotwo> It's like Space Jam 2
[0:17:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> splorch
[0:17:38] <BlackermanZX> "he said the thing!"
[0:17:44] <GeoGio3> star wars scarred me and I don't know if I have the mental fortituude to watch the matrix
[0:17:46] <+Shady_Zaku> @puluxor I haven't lol but I seen em do it, who's first playthrough is this Reggiiie?
[0:17:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I CLAPPED I CLAPPED WHEN I HEARD IT
[0:17:48] <+Rezthryth123> keanu also has the charisma of a wet paper bag
[0:17:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> that's a joke I would tell
[0:17:48] <+Jiggisnipe> was it supposed to be funny?
[0:17:49] <%baka_sugoi> it hit the floor and made no noise
[0:17:49] <andre11dr> Netflix Bebop humor
[0:17:50] <terry_irvin> bro it was such ass
[0:17:51] <+10deez> Kinda is tho
[0:17:53] <+ikantreeed> aye man i love keanu as much as anyone else but...
[0:17:55] <hereiam407> Red pill or blue? Right guys? Right?
[0:17:56] <Ell1ot> omg i was thinking wet fart and you said it!
[0:17:57] <derap41> So you Didn't clap when you saw it?
[0:18:01] <peachy996> Netflix Bebop humor is terrible.
[0:18:07] <%leith_aziz> Was it suppoused to be funny? You seem to phrase it like a revelation moment
[0:18:07] <xerotwo> OLD MAN YELLS AT CLOUD LUL
[0:18:08] <arkv01> the writing was generally awful
[0:18:14] <peachy996> I feel bad for all of the actors from Netflix Bebop
[0:18:16] <%baka_sugoi> OLD MAN
[0:18:17] <dundore77> i couldn't even tell who the hell that was
[0:18:18] <jett_eyes> I think that line sounds funny, but only if you knew the context
[0:18:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MEMBER MATRIX
[0:18:24] <dukenux> is every corny line supposed to be dig at marvel
[0:18:26] <Blank9> It lands with a wet fart, then says “you think that’s air you’re breathing?”
[0:18:26] <+kiradusk4200> when a movies mid its fucking MID
[0:18:27] <peachy996> "Welcome to the Ouch, motherfuckers!"
[0:18:28] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz it was a punchline, yes
[0:18:32] <%RyTYoung> The actor that plays the new Agent Smith is a gem and if no one has saw Mind Hunters go watch that shit
[0:18:40] <hereiam407> You can't explain what the Matrix is woolly, you have to see it for yourself
[0:18:43] <Darren716> I feel the Matrix is even worse by comparison since there's another movie in theaters right now that's also a follow up to a series from 20 years ago and it isn't an embarrassment
[0:18:46] <+miakhalifaisoverrated> Actors still get paid. They’ll be alright
[0:18:50] <tanarath> This feels like a writer/director/producer issue.
[0:18:50] <Lunalios> Remember lightsabers? did you clap when Darth Vader took out his red lightsaber?
[0:18:55] <+BananaSlammuh> The hobo thing was weird. And they meta up having to make another movie but also uh sequel bait? Bizarre
[0:18:57] <miucsa51> Current writers need to stop trying to make Marvel dialogue on everything and i say this a unapologetic marvel fan

[0:19:32] <%Prevot> It's funny how people blame MCU for movies that are worse than 75% of MCU movies
[0:19:34] <+miakhalifaisoverrated> You should introduce her to Pat
[0:19:34] <shotguncrucifix> Marvel Dialogue was Diablo Cody dialogue before the MCU
[0:19:34] <Nabs96> @miucsa51 I totally agree. it's because marvel humour is done well in marvel because that's their thing. if other people try to copy it and do it shittily, then yea it's gonna suck
[0:19:36] <JoshManVGH> Was this movie made simply so WB could hold onto the production rights? Do things like this atrophy if not used?
[0:19:40] <%baka_sugoi> psaUp
[0:19:41] <%MTLer> just smoke a lot and watch Reggie
[0:19:44] <%leith_aziz> My correlation between western and japanese cheese and corn is that I'll always excuse Japanese corn/cheese. I accept it more I guess because I feel it works better seeing from the perspective of a different culture
[0:19:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @joshmanvgh likely
[0:19:52] <@Menitta> i didn't get the MCU vibes from the dialogue
[0:19:52] <derap41> Its only ever been worse
[0:19:56] <Nabs96> @prevot marvel bad cirlcejerk is real
[0:19:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @miucsa51 MARVEL writers need to stop that shit too. it was good for guardians and maybe spiderman, but not all pf em pleeeease
[0:19:59] <@Menitta> it was just bad dialogue
[0:20:00] <%dds333a> it sure did LUL
[0:20:03] <@Solidus_113> 4 is better than 3
[0:20:04] <%diegobandzz> 2 had some good shit
[0:20:06] <%dds333a> horrendous
[0:20:06] <hereiam407> Balboa was alright
[0:20:07] <@Solidus_113> for matrix
[0:20:09] <%FallenAngelZelos> Creed was pretty good though
[0:20:10] <nochejunior> lol Pat's review is gonna be rough
[0:20:13] <%leith_aziz> Balboa had the Rocky and his son scene
[0:20:15] <shotguncrucifix> the matrix 4 is dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan
[0:20:16] <%JetpackMcQuack> impress me
[0:20:22] <%phd_in_thuggery> does he at least have the Robot from Rocky 4?
[0:20:28] <+Shady_Zaku> @darren716 ahh I guess, haven't gotten to see it yet either
[0:20:30] <peachy996> Woolie it's MCU dialogue

[0:20:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> But Creed was hype, tho
[0:20:40] <peachy996> I wasn't
[0:20:42] <Lunalios> yeah MCU humor is used a lot in unnecessary places, tonally dissonant places
[0:20:43] <hereiam407> Anyone see Creed 2?
[0:20:44] <Puhff> it couldn't possibly end worse than Matrix 2
[0:20:45] <%livlinn> Creed wasn't bad shiaSnack
[0:20:46] <+shoryukenabotch> Woolie have you seen my daughter? rbeeSad
[0:20:58] <+TopTieramisu> creed was good. creed 2 is mid
[0:21:02] <hereiam407> I'm looking for... my daughter
[0:21:05] <%RickyRelucent> what if not? best case for them is if its legit not the worst and it will gain a following because reasons
[0:21:05] <+DatAsuna> MCU dialogue has become a buzzword instead of explaining why humour doesn't land
[0:21:07] <shotguncrucifix> creed 2 was ok. no need to see it
[0:21:07] <%leith_aziz> I'd say Thor: The Dark World probably dissapointed people from the start
[0:21:11] <dundore77> i liked the analyzer
[0:21:11] <+deadDinozor> WOOLIE
[0:21:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @puhff why would you challenge people like this LUL
[0:21:15] <+BananaSlammuh> @puhff duh duh duuuuuuhhh
[0:21:18] <+lpabcba> yo silent hill? for real???
[0:21:18] <peachy996> It's not a buzzword if it's true
[0:21:21] <@Menitta> It was not MCU dialogue. I couldn't even tell if it was TRYING to be funny.
[0:21:21] <andre11dr> I still haven't seen my daughter yet
[0:21:22] <Puhff> Keepo
[0:21:24] <Jetfandam> Did any sequel except Blade Runner 2049 not disappoint?
[0:21:27] <%RyTYoung> @veltpuncho yeyeyeye
[0:21:33] <peachy996> MCU Apologists just attempt to run the term back
[0:21:38] <hereiam407> Excuse me officer, have you seen my daughter?
[0:21:38] <Champstice> "mcu dialogue is interesting" FUCKING LMAO
[0:21:39] <+SerialSins> two of the characters were trying really hard to be cool and just failed completely
[0:21:40] <JoshManVGH> @jetfandam Back to the Future 2.
[0:21:42] <xerotwo> LUL
[0:21:42] <sirjames079> Honestly I've always found MCU dialogue to be absolute trash but maybe that's just me
[0:21:42] <terry_irvin> they were Neo Fanboys period
[0:21:43] <+ikantreeed> matrixed out
[0:21:44] <@Menitta> I remember the names of 2 new characters
[0:21:44] <Puhff> Woolie says Matrix 4 doesn't have enough Joss Whedon quipping
[0:21:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Jetfandam Shrek 2
[0:21:46] <%Juriasu> oh noooooo
[0:21:46] <+TopTieramisu> @Jetfandam in recent memory? or ever?
[0:21:47] <%RyTYoung> Woolie is trying to steal the Survival horror fans from Pat LUL
[0:21:47] <%dds333a> @jetfandam careful, that shit had problems too LUL
[0:21:49] <@Menitta> there's like a dozen.
[0:21:51] <nochejunior> ooohh
[0:21:52] <%leith_aziz> Im not really a cynical guy, so I enjoy MCU movies, but I've stopped watching them after Endgame. I feel like that's a nice spot to end on for me
[0:21:53] <StormSamurai8> I had no idea who they were
[0:21:53] <Onorekian> yikes
[0:21:57] <+ikantreeed> Sense 8 was so bad and I don't even remember why
[0:21:57] <%sewermonk> its Nier Automata having not played Nier
[0:21:58] <shotguncrucifix> every john wick movie is good
[0:21:58] <%Juriasu> man I tried to like sense8 but's it's so weird and slow
[0:22:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHO?
[0:22:00] <xerotwo> literal Neo-fanboys LUL
[0:22:03] <+TopTieramisu> godfather 2, terminator 2, aliens
[0:22:05] <Jetfandam> @TopTieramisu in recent memory
[0:22:10] <+TopTieramisu> hmmm
[0:22:13] <KyberNasse> "What are you freaks"
[0:22:14] <+Orbital_Zero> WHOMST?
[0:22:20] <%leith_aziz> Senator Armstrong
[0:22:23] <+Shady_Zaku> @toptieramisu Yeah I assumed he meant recently lol
[0:22:31] <Nabs96> @datasuna which is wild since mcu dialogue lands at least 80% of the time. idk why ppl like to act like that shit is bad.
[0:22:33] <xerotwo> YEP
[0:22:35] <%leith_aziz> Very funny movie
[0:22:36] <derap41> But its so overplayed its grating now

[0:22:49] <%MajorCrasher> KORG is awesome
[0:22:52] <%RickyRelucent> meek ianndvkorg
[0:22:54] <derap41> The Revolution has begun
[0:22:55] <%leith_aziz> KORG GANG pickyProud
[0:22:56] <peachy996> Ah yes Thr Ragnorak
[0:22:57] <JoshManVGH> The rockman who raised a revolution!
[0:22:58] <Reveresao> He's great.
[0:23:03] <Nabs96> KORG FOR DEADPOOL 3
[0:23:04] <xerotwo> KORG INVITES DEADPOOL TO THE MCU
[0:23:06] <miucsa51> Korg KomodoHype
[0:23:10] <%FrostedZaibatsu> I missed the Thor movies
[0:23:10] <+Shady_Zaku> @jetfandam OH! Great example actually, Thor Ragnarok! Best movie, is the third
[0:23:11] <%leith_aziz> He needs to coem back
[0:23:11] <dukenux> i hated his Asgard line tho
[0:23:12] <+kewlmyc> Piss off ghost
[0:23:16] <peachy996> Y'know who wrote Thor Ragnorak? Same guy in charge of Cowboy Betflix
[0:23:17] <lehvak182> loved him
[0:23:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, but revolution is good, though, hard to not like him.
[0:23:23] <BR0Speedwagon> Why does that one guy in the new movie look like Morpheus?
[0:23:23] <Ell1ot> he has strong hands
[0:23:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @peachy996 no way
[0:23:26] <derap41> But now every movie does it
[0:23:32] <terry_irvin> EXACTLY
[0:23:34] <hereiam407> For the MCU sure
[0:23:36] <JoshManVGH> @peachy996 No way!
[0:23:39] <Nabs96> MCU keeps doing it man. they know how to do it. it's their thing
[0:23:44] <mikesapartment> they made me like rocket raccoon
[0:23:45] <+TopTieramisu> failed attempts at MCU humor or way worse than MCU humor
[0:23:47] <kes009900> but Taika is a good director tho
[0:23:48] <%paladinstarbuster> Like Drax
[0:24:00] <Puhff> I'd say that's Watiti charm rather than MCU charm but I hear ya
[0:24:01] <+kewlmyc> And sometimes you get the "funny" chick from Thor 1-2 that makes you want to die.
[0:24:02] <+ghostfaceninja_> Quicksilver in Xmen DoFP
[0:24:09] <peachy996> Yep Christopher Yost
[0:24:09] <Nabs96> @toptieramisu MCU humour is good to he fair. if u don't know how it works u can't recreate it
[0:24:12] <shotguncrucifix> morpheus died in matrix online to that metal gear ass fly villain
[0:24:14] <@Menitta> Bugs is the only character with a little charm.
[0:24:14] <%leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus in that case as a zoomer myself, why do you always highlight MCU "writing" then? Im curious
[0:24:18] <+monsieurfantastic> i give Taika the credit but yeah
[0:24:19] <peachy996> And Andre Nemec of Turtles
[0:24:25] <dukenux> Marvel has plenty of failed funny too
[0:24:27] <drunken_lemur> @kewlmyc She just gets worse with each subsequent appearance.
[0:24:28] <%RickyRelucent> no the random pile of rocks is the i accept ur surrender moment guy from dark world
[0:24:34] <dizimous> it's almost like quipyness and levity aren't inherently bad or stakes-breaking 🤔
[0:24:35] <+monsieurfantastic> mcu is mostly bad jokes
[0:24:42] <+Cjjb1995> just tunes in, what's woolie talking about?
[0:24:48] <+Cjjb1995> *tuned
[0:24:50] <%leith_aziz> @Cjjb1995 Matrix 4
[0:24:51] <+TopTieramisu> @Nabs96 that's what i mean. there's a craft to it, and you can really tell when the writing doesn't have the skill to replicate it
[0:24:53] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @cjjb1995 mateix
[0:24:57] <+Cjjb1995> ty ty
[0:24:58] <hereiam407> MCU dialogue works for a comic book movie
[0:25:01] <@Menitta> I feel like people nowadays would call bond quips "MCU dialogue". it's a phrase used too much not correctly.
[0:25:05] <Champstice> @Cjjb1995 "bluh matrix 4 doesn't have MCU dialogue"
[0:25:14] <%FallenAngelZelos> @hereiam407 Nail on the head
[0:25:18] <+Cjjb1995> I think Rocco Botte had a really interesting take on it, highly recommend people watch his video
[0:25:18] <%MrP33Ps> No Way Home made me laugh a lot
[0:25:29] <miucsa51> be honest with chat were the  wachowski sisters another george lucas?
[0:25:34] <derap41> Keanu did it to be nice
[0:25:38] <+TopTieramisu> i could have used a few less quips from the villains when they were all together
[0:25:38] <floralkami> @hereiam407 the matrix could easily be adapted as such, let's not joke as if comics can't tell good stories
[0:25:45] <Lunalios> there are some MCU movies where that's done well Guardians and Ragnarok are much more comedically driven than something like doctor strange
[0:25:47] <peachy996> Nah nobody is one Lucas level
[0:25:49] <kikosmore> This "review" is on the pod?
[0:25:50] <@Menitta> well Jupiter Ascending was garbage.
[0:25:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @cjjb1995 where at?
[0:25:54] <BGArmitage> Keanu has been in some stinker project recently
[0:25:55] <%leith_aziz> Like, does chat dislike MCU or something? Im mostly asking as an outsider. I'd like to be enlightend pickyLurk
[0:26:03] <%Prevot> people complaining about "MCU dialogue" gives me "rick and morty is for high IQ people" feelings, they always sound like they're smelling their own farts
[0:26:09] <steve_the_suus> first half of Jupiter Ascending was aight
[0:26:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> couldn't get Fishbourne apparently
[0:26:10] <Mahuloq> You ever played Blaseball?
[0:26:10] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @leith_aziz i like mcu
[0:26:10] <Puhff> I'm interested in Carrie Ann Moss so that's fine with me
[0:26:11] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:26:17] <BGArmitage> Cyberpunk and Matrix, the only decent thing was John Wick
[0:26:17] <terry_irvin> Lawrence Fishbourne dodged a bullet
[0:26:18] <steve_the_suus> like before the bees
[0:26:19] <+TungstenViper> Claoud Atlas mas amazing tho
[0:26:20] <theredfox930000> reggie gonna get spooked nzeroMicCheck nzeroMicCheck nzeroMicCheck spookyDolphin spookyDolphin nzeroDrCello nzeroDrCello FamilyMan
[0:26:22] <%RickyRelucent> @keith its just kinda mindless to a some
[0:26:23] <peachy996> @Prevot Watch Cowboy Bebop Netflix I dare you
[0:26:25] <Champstice> people praising "MCU dialogue" gives me "rick and morty is for high IQ people" feelings, they always sound like they're smelling their own farts
[0:26:25] <hereiam407> @floralkami I don't think comics make bad stories, its just a particular style the MCU has. Even at its darkest moments, its still closer to a cartoon, so the dialogue works for it.
[0:26:29] <steve_the_suus> Cloud Atlas is 3 hours too long
[0:26:30] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @ghostfaceninja_ his character is dead
[0:26:31] <%leith_aziz> (not playing defensive. Talk shit about it if you want. But share your thoughts)
[0:26:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:26:32] <%diegobandzz> Carrie Ann is finer than a mferr
[0:26:34] <Lunalios> IT BROKE NEW GROUND
[0:26:35] <dukenux> Keanu has been in WAY worse movies
[0:26:36] <%MelBrooksKA> You pushed the Gundam Seed Button
[0:26:37] <%MTLer> it's the nostalgia appeal
[0:26:37] <%FallenAngelZelos> @leith_aziz i think that they use a formula that a lot of people are exhausted of. I still enjoy them, but I can understand where they're coming from.
[0:26:38] <+Bogart4321> yea yea yea yea yea
[0:26:38] <%Prevot> @peachy996 why the fuck would I do that lol
[0:26:39] <depressioncherrie> @leith_aziz Don't know about "chat" but I was done with Superhero movies for the rest of my life by the time Ironman 2 came out.
[0:26:40] <%X2Eliah> X2Eliah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey woolz. Happy new year!
[0:26:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> very brave
[0:26:44] <+ghostfaceninja_> @Reverend_Roscoe so was Trinity...
[0:26:48] <+TopTieramisu> i think people more have problems with "MCU dialogue" when they're added to franchises that didn't have that kind of humor before
[0:26:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> SILENT HILL, THO
[0:26:53] <%dds333a> What's next LUL
[0:26:55] <%RickyRelucent> plz do

[0:26:56] <theredfox930000> nah stay
[0:26:57] <Johannen> Where is SIlent Hill thou
[0:27:00] <hereiam407> @floralkami It all depends on tone, the Matrix movies could do it, but its not the usual style
[0:27:00] <xerotwo> Oh boy
[0:27:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no
[0:27:02] <%dds333a> Here we go again LUL

[0:27:04] <%leith_aziz> Covid is mostly why
[0:27:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> FUCK

[0:27:05] <vavilonica> nonononono
[0:27:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:27:06] <Djinnazz> cuz its better?
[0:27:06] <Puhff> OH GOD NO
[0:27:06] <Tracazoid> Because delay based always sucked
[0:27:07] <lyzejag> OH NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:27:07] <%Irridium> ???
[0:27:09] <%FrostedZaibatsu> We ALL hated delay based
[0:27:10] <yukichocomilk> oh god
[0:27:10] <bosssbatttle> oh boy
[0:27:12] <%leith_aziz> It was like a breaking point
[0:27:12] <+Jiggisnipe> cuz we don't have locals
[0:27:12] <+SolGainer> LUL
[0:27:12] <+FlyingRamen> goddamnit
[0:27:12] <floralkami> it's not been suddenly, WTF??

[0:27:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> S I L E N T H I L L PLEASE
[0:27:14] <terry_irvin> OH BOY
[0:27:14] <yukichocomilk> rollback is a MUST
[0:27:15] <lyzejag> STUNLOCKED ??
[0:27:15] <%FrostedZaibatsu> HATE
[0:27:15] <BlackermanZX> oh boy
[0:27:16] <+TungstenViper> Because Fighting games netcode sucks
[0:27:16] <%diegobandzz> YES
[0:27:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> PLEASE
[0:27:19] <miucsa51> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:27:22] <MikeyxStyles> Can't wait for the spoiler thoughts on the movie
[0:27:24] <Champstice> Time for a longer convo than the matrix 4 one!!!
[0:27:25] <%notsoy> AND THAT NETCODE FUCKING SUCKS
[0:27:26] <OldManDeckardCain> being able to actually play the game online? we don't need that Kappa
[0:27:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's real simple: THEY ARE TIRED OF DELAY-BASED, GOD PLEASE
[0:27:30] <kikosmore> Just because it's always been done , doesn't make it right lol
[0:27:30] <Lunalios> MCU is fun and I love the interconnectivity but sometimes I feel like that and safe comedy bits are used to make a lot of movies feel creative safe and similar
[0:27:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat has woolie in an infinite
[0:27:32] <+croxeye> delay based was around for a long time, it also sucked ass for a long time
[0:27:35] <amiavamp> try soulcalibur 6 online and ask again why rollback is important
[0:27:36] <+SolGainer> people got a taste of the real shit and now they can never go back
[0:27:37] <vavilonica> tfw the stream is canceled because Silent Hill 1 doesn't have rollback
[0:27:37] <huskarl_zap> here comes the next fifty minutes
[0:27:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT LUL
[0:27:42] <%Irridium> It wasn't acceptable we just had no god damn choice.
[0:27:42] <theredfox930000> mortal kombat saved the fgc
[0:27:44] <+lpabcba> "why would you want a better thing when a worse thing exists?"
[0:27:45] <Blank9> I want to play games that don’t suck to play, that is all
[0:27:47] <%baka_sugoi> no power steering
[0:27:47] <andre11dr> One netcode just objectively works better
[0:27:49] <+crewmate> Played PS3 Tekken and SF4, it was bad
[0:27:51] <+TungstenViper> Covid made it so the netcode MUST be good for the game to be succesful
[0:27:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @lightbringrrrr
[0:27:52] <+TheBitingIrish> woolieYIKES
[0:27:54] <MOON__MIST> except rollback has been around for almost a decade now too?
[0:27:58] <floralkami> like, it's not a sudden new problem, rollback had been around for damn near two decades
[0:28:00] <OblivionSword1> because delay based sucks and there are no alternative for the longest time
[0:28:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> do you want to play the game online? if so you won't accomplish that with delay based netcode
[0:28:02] <miucsa51> Harada keeps getting away with it
[0:28:02] <+0neReeler> hey i like the look of this car tho
[0:28:03] <%diegobandzz> QUICK hit him with more woolie bait
[0:28:11] <+ClericOfSparda> Anti-Lock Breaks
[0:28:12] <+CrisLeFortL> without asisted steering
[0:28:14] <Champstice> PLEASE, PLAY SILENT HlLL
[0:28:16] <JoshManVGH> this offroad pump trolly is the only way I can get to the store, so I guess I'll use it.
[0:28:20] <%leith_aziz> I'll never heal the scar of Xrd not getting rollback for a long time. Good thing I have Strive at least pickyDesire
[0:28:26] <%livlinn> patients chat, Woolie got job to do kyoryuTeaRex
[0:28:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'd say "Look how long they've ignored THE SOLUTION"
[0:28:31] <@Solidus_113> frame-by-frame genre
[0:28:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @champstice NOOl, FIGHTING GAMES
[0:28:31] <fuji_n2> @champstice they will, chill
[0:28:31] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Its like using dial-up compared to fiber internet
[0:28:31] <%leith_aziz> Think Lag in shooters
[0:28:43] <%X2Eliah> Yeah networking problems on a competitive, fast-paced, directly versus style of game is just not viable.
[0:28:44] <+Jiggisnipe> 2006
[0:28:51] <andre11dr> Rollback has been around for a long time but the Japanese are to stuck in their ways to use it because "IT'S GOOD OVER HERE SO FUCK YOU"
[0:28:56] <hereiam407> I'm afraid its been 13 years
[0:28:56] <styptysat> what game first had rollback
[0:28:57] <+TungstenViper> FACTS
[0:28:59] <peachy996> Give SC6 Rollback Netcode goddamnit
[0:29:02] <OldManDeckardCain> ok but why do we need round wheels? the square ones made from stone kinda work Kappa
[0:29:06] <%X2Eliah> Like on a co-op shooter, you can have rubberbanding, delay comp etc, cos' it doesnt matter
[0:29:06] <+TopTieramisu> if only more western devs made good fighting games
[0:29:08] <+0neReeler> ggpo has been on pc forever just not steam
[0:29:09] <+TungstenViper> Japanese companies being close minded and not giving a fuck
[0:29:12] <Lunalios> exactly
[0:29:14] <+mechslayer71> I just watched the Korg highlights, holy shit what a great character
[0:29:15] <peachy996> Holding SC6 hostage at this point
[0:29:17] <%dds333a> It being held up as the only thing people talk about to the detriment of everything else always struck me as odd, however, despite being for it
[0:29:23] <+TopTieramisu> japan makes great games. they are so behind on netcode
[0:29:27] <+SjoeB89> Does Parsec alleviate this for most games?
[0:29:29] <%Nested_Dreams> The thing that changed is that locals are no longer a solution when you need to have solid matches
[0:29:35] <miucsa51> Just say harada
[0:29:35] <Onorekian> so rollback is not a new thing? people just  didn't know it existed back then?
[0:29:36] <%FrostedZaibatsu> @andre11dr Its not even good over there. JP players have been voicing this for a while
[0:29:37] <+Jiggisnipe> @SjoeB89 kinda
[0:29:39] <Champstice> Also look with all due respect, it's so annoying that every single other aspect of a fighting game seems to mean nothing if no rollback
[0:29:41] <theredfox930000> to be honest locals were very huge
[0:29:42] <%Irridium> @SjoeB89 it does but that's just on PC
[0:29:46] <Puhff> Japanese video game companies selling globally but acting like that only sell locally will never cease to baffle
[0:29:46] <%dds333a> exclusively online
[0:29:49] <+0neReeler> parsec does except the matchmaking...

[0:32:10] <%notsoy> mvci does have rollback netcode, the netcode being functional is the only reason a small community still exists
[0:32:11] <andre11dr> WELCOME IN OMIKRON
[0:32:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @fuji_n2
[0:32:15] <floralkami> also you have fuckers that just want to watch the world burn, for the sake of getting a match in.
[0:32:15] <+Jiggisnipe> @FrostedZaibatsu mvci has rollback
[0:32:24] <Lunalios> rollback is exactly what I needed to get into fighting games without feeling like I'm playing two different games between online and offline
[0:32:26] <aka_Jigawatt> im fat af
[0:32:34] <peachy996> I pity the non-MK crowd who know not of Rollback
[0:32:37] <%leith_aziz> But yeah, I'll probably do ok being an Arcsys guy and having Rollback in Strive. Doesnt excuse other games not having rollback

[0:33:05] <+eanscrale> like remember the flu pandemic? Is the flu gone now???
[0:33:06] <+lpabcba> also rollback can be implemented poorly....tekken 7
[0:33:09] <+0neReeler> moral of the story: just play strive
[0:33:10] <%diegobandzz> This amount of preamble is getting pat like Lmaoo
[0:33:10] <@Solidus_113> Granblue Versus is completely dead in the water because it doesn't have good online
[0:33:11] <%notsoy> it's not great rollback, it just happens to be better than sf5 and other shit implementations

[0:33:30] <%X2Eliah> Japan doesn't rollback. It's undignified.
[0:33:30] <Afrosamasenpai> Good on my end

[0:33:59] <Lunalios> "walking with dinosaurs"
[0:34:02] <%leith_aziz> The KI guy deciding to work with Arcsys for a while to get Strive rollback might have been a miracle

[0:34:14] <arkv01> plague's only got barncast
[0:34:15] <@Menitta> It's not like there's recent raw data of a game being completely revived in numbers and becoming on par with Guilty Gear Strive by implementing rollback.
[0:34:16] <+ClericOfSparda> Imagine never improving from CRTV's to HDMI because CRTV's just work
[0:34:19] <OldManDeckardCain> "Will you link the delay netcode, or will you cast the world into the rollback netcode shadows..."
[0:34:19] <%leith_aziz> But hey, now we have rollback for the future
[0:34:20] <+0neReeler> it's better but sales probably don't change by much
[0:34:21] <Josef_Stryker> I don't see what the problem is, it's fine for me
[0:34:24] <+TopTieramisu> katsuhiro "don't as me for shit" harada

[0:34:27] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Does P4A on other consoles have rollback?

[0:39:27] <Tracazoid> So Woolie, this might sound like spoilers but are you shooting for the best ending?
[0:39:27] <fuji_n2> yeah let's not bring the baggage we have chat
[0:39:27] <+taren817> Woolie is playing SILENT HILL? Is Pat involved?
[0:39:29] <KingPelleas> Woolie head empty basically

[0:39:36] <%Shad0wTag> Lets get this bread fellas
[0:39:37] <andre11dr> There's a lot of lore
[0:39:39] <emMmDeeKay> Like Halo, the right time to abandon the franchise is right after 3
[0:39:39] <%zenus_epsilon> are you playing the HD version or the os version?
[0:39:43] <peachy996> 1 2 3 and Shattered Memories. Play The Room at your own peril
[0:39:43] <ThisIsNotEdward> it's bread
[0:39:46] <%leith_aziz> People will probably tell you "play 1-4"
[0:39:46] <shotguncrucifix> silent hill 4 the room should have been a wiseau collab
[0:39:47] <%Shad0wTag> Take my gift subs boys

[0:39:53] <+FennecZephyr> Not all of Halo
[0:39:55] <+toomuchsnarf> all of halo huh
[0:39:57] <+king_of_mystery2> Time for Halo 4 woolie
[0:39:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not ALL of it Kappa

[0:40:01] <+even_the_yuenglings> theres halo with grappling hooks now
[0:40:01] <+warlockwithapixie> Halo was BIG
[0:40:01] <+PositivelyNick> Halo ItsHappening ItsHappening ItsHappening

[0:40:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> but what about Thing II?
[0:40:14] <shotguncrucifix> halo 4 was better than reach
[0:40:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> rotate the pallette
[0:40:15] <those_bananas> schedule
[0:40:15] <Nabs96> @puhff I'm thinking some time after Woolie Vs Elden Ring
[0:40:16] <%X2Eliah> @Puhff sometime after finishing 1
[0:40:18] <+DatAsuna> maybe next year
[0:40:18] <crudjandall> Silent Hill 4 is good, don't let the purists turn you away
[0:40:18] <KeroKamina> All the good ones
[0:40:20] <peachy996> Don't play 4, Listen to the Soundtrack instead. Much better experience lol
[0:40:21] <%FallenAngelZelos> hope you have a guide nearby for this game, @WoolieVersus
[0:40:21] <%Vigonept> Wheres the 7th stand user 2 woolie
[0:40:22] <%superc37> but what about halo 4 tho
[0:40:22] <floralkami> i still need to go back and watch all those; you go too hard with the playthroughs sometimes
[0:40:22] <+Jiggisnipe> any none Bungie Halo doesn't exist for Woolie
[0:40:23] <+Shady_Zaku> @peachy996 Origins?
[0:40:23] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @puhff not for a while
[0:40:23] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Drop your axe.
[0:40:27] <%zeroarturia> @hereiam407 Pat warned him about the collection
[0:40:27] <hereiam407> Reach was wayyy better than 4, 4 was so boring
[0:40:27] <%superc37> and yakuza 0
[0:40:28] <%tigerfang86> 👀
[0:40:28] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:40:28] <+mechslayer71> next thing
[0:40:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> yes
[0:40:30] <KingPelleas> FF6 PLS
[0:40:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dark souls
[0:40:31] <%leith_aziz> I actually missed most of those playthoughs. Didnt know of your channel during that time
[0:40:32] <mikesapartment> i want the next thing until it drops
[0:40:34] <alfredfromthedusk> FF6?
[0:40:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:40:35] <Zeif00> Yes
[0:40:38] <peachy996> @Shady_Zaku Uhhhhhh Hard to say
[0:40:38] <Lunalios> Yes
[0:40:38] <%Hapsam> I think the variety is a thing that makes your content special, i enjoy it immensly.
[0:40:39] <Afrosamasenpai> Both
[0:40:41] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:40:41] <%Juriasu> disco elysium, okay I'll take it
[0:40:42] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:40:43] <Johannen> But also NEXT THING
[0:40:43] <DXLelouch24> BOTH
[0:40:45] <emMmDeeKay> Next Bit
[0:40:46] <hereiam407> Give it to me all
[0:40:47] <Gelphaze> LOVE IT!
[0:40:47] <%patriotrenegade> I want dark souls
[0:40:47] <KingPelleas> Just do both lol
[0:40:49] <+irlGlitch> DARK. SOULS.
[0:40:49] <BigYanno> Just work 24/7. Give us ALL THE THING
[0:40:50] <Blank9> Woolie is setting up 12 different option selects
[0:40:50] <+DatAsuna> especially when it's long games
[0:40:53] <Nabs96> sorry what was woolie saying I zoned out
[0:40:55] <floralkami> give me the cake and let me eat it too
[0:40:55] <%leith_aziz> @emMmDeeKay Then we have Infinite  pickyEZ
[0:40:56] <$tkuwari> I hope next thing becomes Silent Hill
[0:40:56] <Solidnick18> hard to say
[0:40:57] <peachy996> Origins isn't as much of a trashfire as Homecoming
[0:40:57] <+mechslayer71> dark souls was a next thing tho
[0:40:58] <+solzan2000> SMTV is godlike
[0:40:58] <%Vigonept> but those next things where the things oiwanted
[0:41:00] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Mystery box
[0:41:02] <DXLelouch24> both, only those without power choose one or the other
[0:41:03] <%ATentacleMonster> Nocturne is amazing but the encounter rate is trash LUL
[0:41:03] <shotguncrucifix> reaches campaign was like if you took the halo 3 campaign and removed the setpieces and excitement
[0:41:10] <Solidnick18> smt5 very good
[0:41:10] <andre11dr> This shouldn't last long anyway, it's gonna be like 4 sessions at most
[0:41:10] <crudjandall> @peachy996 the only bad thing about 4 is backtracking which exists in RE2 LUL
[0:41:17] <+Fidranth> did woolie deliberately make the expression when he said disco elysium or was that subconscious
[0:41:18] <CaptainBright> Freikugel + Power Charge + Pierce
[0:41:20] <Blank9> World of STR
[0:41:23] <Nabs96> @peachy996 Hey! Homecoming was a great spiderman movie ok
[0:41:25] <+DatAsuna> also it has dante from the DMC series
[0:41:26] <%Shad0wTag> Digital Devil Saga to throw people off Woolz
[0:41:29] <Champstice> I'm not sure how interested either of you are in rhythmy-type games, but Everhood might be worth a gander in the future
[0:41:30] <@Menitta> Just play a REAL SMT game on stream like Trauma Center
[0:41:31] <GHouseduivel> Yeah but reach had Emily
[0:41:33] <+Shady_Zaku> @peachy996 Yea I thought it was considered decent
[0:41:35] <crudjandall> "my house"
[0:41:36] <+DatAsuna> Though Raidou is better since he actually has an ending and context
[0:41:37] <Lunalios> I'm gonna go on a hunch and say SMT has little connective tissue between games, right?
[0:41:37] <BlackermanZX> SH1 is so jank but still one of the best ps1 games
[0:41:37] <peachy996> @crudjandall I dunno there's a lot of weak parts in 4 that don't involve backtracking
[0:41:38] <%leith_aziz> Why do I feel tired of chat trashtalking random games by now? pickyTired
[0:41:40] <emMmDeeKay> @emMmDeeKay did I STUTTER?
[0:41:41] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag you know it
[0:41:44] <peachy996> The Ghosts
[0:41:44] <fuji_n2> @menitta is in the know
[0:41:47] <floralkami> @menitta okay but seriously tho
[0:41:47] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta WITH MOTION CONTROLS
[0:41:50] <Darren716> Oh shit is this gonna be Woolies first time with tank controls?
[0:41:51] <%leith_aziz> Try the 1st one.
[0:41:53] <hereiam407> Does anyone like Catalyst?
[0:41:56] <%leith_aziz> Maybe you'll like it
[0:42:01] <%livlinn> variou5VariousX
[0:42:02] <@Solidus_113> Catalyst was fine but weird
[0:42:02] <+DatAsuna> he did
[0:42:04] <%Shad0wTag> @hereiam407 Its not awful
[0:42:12] <hereiam407> Maybe I should try it then
[0:42:14] <GHouseduivel> ha a "Run"
[0:42:15] <crudjandall> @peachy996 it's not as good as first 3, but I think it's still worth playing. definitely understand some of the criticism
[0:42:17] <%dds333a> @lunalios quite
[0:42:19] <shotguncrucifix> Reach had no BR, implemented bloom and ruined games with armor lock
[0:42:21] <%leith_aziz> @emMmDeeKay Do I care? pickySmug
[0:42:23] <Mahuloq> What makes a good Horror game, Amnesia was much scarier then something like RE: Village.
[0:42:25] <+SjoeB89> Did you ever play Furi?
[0:42:26] <mikesapartment> the grapple hook just sucks
[0:42:28] <%livlinn> jessin8Coffee
[0:42:32] <@Solidus_113> problems mostly come with level design for me
[0:42:40] <@Menitta> I replayed Mirrors Edge Catalyst recently. it has a lot of fun stuff but the open world felt so poorly designed.
[0:42:43] <@Squdnate> @Mahuloq Those are also two very different kinds of horror
[0:42:45] <emMmDeeKay> @emMmDeeKay care enough to reply apparently.
[0:42:46] <Kriss1827> @Mahuloq Personally atmosphere makes a great horror game
[0:42:49] <hereiam407> Halo Infinite grapple hook is sweet
[0:42:50] <TaloKur29> I missed the silent hill genre… bastSip
[0:42:53] <peachy996> @crudjandall I think the overall soundtrack is wonderful, there's SO much from Yamaoka in The Room
[0:42:55] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:42:55] <+Shady_Zaku> @sjoeb89 Yea he has
[0:42:55] <%Shad0wTag> @SjoeB89 on the old channel I believe
[0:42:56] <fuji_n2> LUL
[0:42:57] <%leith_aziz> @Mahuloq Amnesia is considered like peak horror to some, so I dont know
[0:42:58] <Grim1952> It's like pizza, a bad grapple hook is still a grapple hook
[0:43:03] <peachy996> Pulsating Ambience
[0:43:05] <%MTLer> always
[0:43:09] <floralkami> @mahuloq eh, i think that may come from the fact you can defend yourself in RE
[0:43:14] <+DatAsuna> it's basically a bad metroid prime grapple beam
[0:43:14] <+kewlmyc> Not me
[0:43:15] <Puhff> SAY IT LUL
[0:43:15] <Solidnick18> not me
[0:43:16] <lehvak182> Kinda sad that PT never turned into a real thing
[0:43:18] <crudjandall> @peachy996 at least people appreciate the soundtrack, it's really good stuff
[0:43:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> looking to start SOME SHIT
[0:43:23] <Nabs96> @mtler wait what's the story behind the name haha
[0:43:26] <lehvak182> I miss Silent Hill

[0:54:34] <sylphyyyy> this game is why I will still defend tank controls in horror games
[0:54:37] <hassanico2> This is a PS1 game BTW

[0:55:00] <+lpabcba> @sylphyyyy people that think tank controls are objectively bad are losers
[0:55:01] <%dds333a> It foes have elements of Survival

[1:01:56] <BR0Speedwagon> Fun fact Woolie and Reggie: The reason for the fog in Silent Hill was a creative way to cover up just how bad the draw distance in the game was.
[1:01:57] <chhdez> Harry has some sick overheads tho
[1:01:57] <hereiam407> God, its so foggy outside, omg

[1:02:18] <dukenux> look at this lovely snowy christmas aura
[1:02:24] <Onorekian> loving the lack of vsync
[1:02:24] <hassanico2> I can see why a 12 year old would dislike this
[1:02:27] <hereiam407> Im so happy this is happening
[1:02:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh... My Car.
[1:02:28] <%CateHecate> nice jeep
[1:02:30] <+MagiKestral> I'm really worried that woolie accidentally rebound the controls trying to exit
[1:02:33] <huskarl_zap> that was not his car
[1:02:35] <dukenux> Jesus Harry, how did you get that car like that
[1:02:36] <%dds333a> on the channel too
[1:02:38] <fuji_n2> it's a good one

[1:02:40] <+Speed1ines> I LOVE MY DADDY
[1:02:40] <artoflec> you know, i NEVER walked back toward my car in this game ever, i can't believe ive never seen this
[1:02:40] <+Shady_Zaku> @br0speedwagon and BOOOOY DOES IT WORK!
[1:02:42] <horriblegoatdemon> It's alright
[1:02:42] <those_bananas> shattered memories also on the ps2
[1:02:43] <%superc37> shattered memories was good
[1:02:44] <Vitoria90> Shattered Memories also on PS2, and yeah it's a spiritual remake of this
[1:02:44] <huskarl_zap> that jeep renegade
[1:02:45] <hassanico2> Shattered Memories is very different but it's fine.
[1:02:45] <hereiam407> A bit of a remake of this game
[1:02:45] <%Prevot> I LOVE MY DADDY
[1:02:46] <Onorekian> its a spin-off
[1:02:47] <superchunk121> That's a good one
[1:02:47] <Darren716> Oh then you'll like this Kappa
[1:02:47] <%dds333a> I LOVE MY DADDY
[1:02:48] <andre11dr> This is really fitting cause it's foggy as shit outside right now
[1:02:48] <+DatAsuna> shattered memories is very good, though mechanically very different
[1:02:48] <dukenux> I LOVE MY DADDY
[1:02:49] <JoshManVGH> Wiilent Hill, if you will
[1:02:49] <HorribleHog> I'm so happy we get to see this! laeCozy
[1:02:50] <BlackermanZX> shattered memories was good and pretty sad
[1:02:50] <peachy996> SM is weird but it's also good
[1:02:50] <Tracazoid> Shattered Memories being a loose, quite loose retelling of 1
[1:02:50] <hereiam407> I LOVE MY DADDY!
[1:02:52] <%Juriasu> which movie?
[1:02:52] <%lightbringrrrr> it's a sort of retelling of this game
[1:02:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:02:55] <OblivionSword1> isn't shattered memories a rewrite of this game ?
[1:02:55] <%Hapsam> shattered memories is a good one
[1:02:55] <+hukurowl> Shattered Memories is actually a remake of 1, interestingly enough
[1:02:56] <bleugh> look at this falling ash Kappa
[1:02:56] <hassanico2> Good on ya Woolie
[1:02:56] <%KellBeII> shattered memories is like a weird remake/sequel
[1:02:57] <%FallenAngelZelos> wasn't shattered memories like the last good SH game?
[1:02:58] <+king_of_mystery2> And PT
[1:02:58] <%livlinn> VOID
[1:02:58] <Grim1952> The movie is great
[1:03:02] <GHouseduivel> The Movies have some raw ass GORE
[1:03:02] <%Irridium> abyss
[1:03:03] <+kewlmyc> Woolie the Liar
[1:03:03] <%zeroarturia> Shattered Memories is a re-imaginingof the 1st game
[1:03:03] <Solidnick18> shattered memories is rad
[1:03:04] <brunoberserk> shattered memories is a weird ''reimagining''
[1:03:04] <peachy996> The movie tries.
[1:03:05] <hereiam407> @FallenAngelZelos Yes
[1:03:07] <horriblegoatdemon> Shattered Memories has better ideas than execution
[1:03:07] <%klooswep> oi it's jus a wee lil' silent hill Kappa
[1:03:08] <leomuratore> movie is good
[1:03:08] <+hukurowl> *reimagining
[1:03:09] <+wewvic> Is that going to youtube later?
[1:03:10] <%dds333a> it's awful
[1:03:13] <dundore77> visually cool bad movie
[1:03:14] <fuji_n2> the movie did its beast
[1:03:14] <%FallenAngelZelos> @hereiam407 that's so frickin sad
[1:03:15] <Onorekian> the movie had cool moments
[1:03:15] <%CateHecate> that one lady getting her skin pulled off in the movie is so sick
[1:03:17] <%SerialSins> the first one really tries
[1:03:18] <dukenux> Shaterred Memories is a true remake, as in, it changes things
[1:03:19] <fuji_n2> *best
[1:03:19] <%leith_aziz> The Pyramid head, right?
[1:03:23] <hereiam407> What does Harry Mason think of the Matrix?
[1:03:23] <%guiltyboya> I LOVE MY DADDY
[1:03:26] <legion0047> all style, no substance
[1:03:27] <+Orbital_Zero> the only one I played was Homecoming and I really liked it lol
[1:03:27] <leomuratore> It tried, tbh.
[1:03:28] <peachy996> I can't say the movie is a bad videogame movie
[1:03:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @wewvic always
[1:03:30] <crudjandall> first movie is decent, revelations was a great romantic comedy
[1:03:32] <Leud_De_Grace> Felt shattered memories story was pretty decent if it wasnt a rewrite
[1:03:34] <Nabs96> have u guys seen that one movie where pyramid head literally rips the skin off some lady as if it was fabric?
[1:03:35] <Onorekian> his car's paintjob looks awful
[1:03:36] <%Pillagius> I remember it on superbestfriends where Matt was coloring the stupid house picture for half an hour
[1:03:36] <Darren716> hmm
[1:03:36] <%livlinn> first movie was aight
[1:03:37] <+Bitscreed> The thing I always remember about the first Silent Hill movie is the wobbly Garth Marenghi-style gravestones in the cemetery scene
[1:03:38] <+wewvic> Thanks
[1:03:38] <+Shady_Zaku> Yeah Shattered Memories is a remake of this kinda
[1:03:40] <%CateHecate> arent the silent hill movies by Uwe Boll?
[1:03:40] <dukenux> I really found new appreciation for the first Silent Hill movie after i watched 2nd one
[1:03:43] <Leud_De_Grace> Gaemplay wise is eh
[1:03:47] <Zeif00> Apparently a lot of that movie was cut, like a lot of the exploration scenes
[1:03:47] <arkv01> insurance claim rates are unusually high in silent hill
[1:03:54] <%RyTYoung> I played a really weird FPS horror game on PS1 back in the day and still to this day don't know the name of that game to this day, you walked down tiny corridors with brown and grimey walls, I've tried looking up this game but still can't figure out the name...
[1:03:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's a Stephen King reference
[1:03:56] <legion0047> isn't it literally the same crash
[1:03:59] <dundore77> that means nothing you wont run out of stamina
[1:04:00] <lehvak182> Woolie will figure it ouy
[1:04:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> spooky
[1:04:04] <dukenux> the SH:O movie is amusingly terrible
[1:04:04] <TheButtravage> @CateHecate No, those movies are too competent to e by him.
[1:04:05] <+Shady_Zaku> @pillagius That's ANCIENT DEEP knowledge pulls lol
[1:04:08] <+pyrojack6> pyrojack6 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:04:09] <+gargoylecube> @RyTYoung Hellnight?
[1:04:12] <hereiam407> Where's the pizza?
[1:04:13] <GHouseduivel> Is this PS1 or PS1 😏
[1:04:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Silent Hill has terrable drivers
[1:04:18] <AncyentMarinere> Woolie i thought you were on one of the LP’s with pat back in the day, i saw it somewhat recently maybe im just mixing it up
[1:04:19] <peachy996> I love the backround music. It's nice to have Ambient music while you wander
[1:04:20] <%RyTYoung> @gargoylecube I'll double check
[1:04:21] <amiavamp> @RyTYoung I've played something like that too on a rental, no idea what it is
[1:04:22] <hassanico2> Does this game have an equivalent to the Historical Society in terms of WTF?
[1:04:25] <%dds333a> @nabs96 that's what we're talking about
[1:04:27] <hereiam407> Fart Gas City
[1:04:29] <%FallenAngelZelos> oh god superman 64
[1:04:30] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the first one at least had a little heart to it due to the leads being fans of the series, the guy in charge of the second movie didn't care for the IP and found videogames stupid
[1:04:32] <%CateHecate> Ah, Christophe Gans, not Uwe Boll. Still a weird french man that directs video game movies
[1:04:32] <+Speed1ines> @RyTYoung Hellnight?
[1:04:33] <+SilverDevilfish> Then there's no time to waste
[1:04:33] <%tigerfang86> if you want to save your friends, solve my maze!!!!!
[1:04:34] <%leith_aziz> Woolie re-igniting memes

[1:04:39] <bleugh> lex luthor runs silent hill
[1:04:40] <%SerialSins> THAT'S THE REASON FOR FAART GAS?
[1:04:40] <crudjandall> Silent Hill ripped off superman,/ correct
[1:04:40] <%superc37> man i cant believe pat did thay
[1:04:41] <huskarl_zap> lex luthor ate 40 cakes
[1:04:42] <Onorekian> konbini

[1:09:10] <Johannen> Its internal monolgue
[1:09:10] <dundore77> see this is why you should always carry a lighter even if your not a smoker
[1:09:12] <amiavamp> people claim doom 3 was the first game with real darkness, mfers forgot about this
[1:09:17] <%X2Eliah> Why would you not turn on the flashlight led on your mobile phone tho

[1:38:34] <%Mr_Plate_Of_Soup> Stop trying shoot everything you see, it’s not Megaman, just ignore enemies, you can outmaneuver/outsmart a lot of them.
[1:38:35] <$MattyNezz> after doing enough damage to an enemy, they will be put into a down state. press action on them without aiming and you'll do a stomp that does infinite damage

[1:38:38] <Solidnick18> PIPE HIM
[1:38:39] <BlackermanZX> you can stomp right?
[1:38:39] <Nabs96> @amnotgoodwithcompooter My advice is to just enjoy yourself and not worry about grades or saves or all that. if you end up really loving the game and want to replay for speedruns and stuff then by all means try for the S rank, but for now definitely just take it at hour pace and enjoy!

[2:08:49] <dukenux> Does SH1 have different puzzle difficulty?

[2:09:49] <%dds333a> quite thick
[2:09:57] <andre11dr> I think in the latter SH game if you'd use to much amo ,the game would spawn more so you could finish the game
[2:10:01] <%dds333a> it always will hold up, to me
[2:10:03] <hereiam407> Imagine if you made a game, without designing it around micro transactions

[2:30:58] <KaiserMario> Piano isn't as bad as people make it out to be, I figured it out without a guide even back then
[2:31:01] <+kevlarkoala> nope, graphics too. time and care go into making the graphics look good and when that doesn't happen, the art design can't save it
[2:31:02] <TalisKanju> I guess the hall is the cafeteria?
[2:31:10] <casualshinji> "Who's your daddy and what does he do?"
[2:31:11] <%dds333a> @artoflec no, end of days Kappa
[2:31:13] <+kevlarkoala> time and care should go into all aspects of the game, and that includes the graphics
[2:31:20] <+Dakuu75> @jolly_adventurer PT was like… 2016 or something right?

[3:11:04] <projectcapsule> this fucking puzzle  cryptic af
[3:11:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @crudjandall I don't know how to tell you this... but you were probably in a Survival Horror Game without knowing.
[3:11:10] <crudjandall> I will not assist, puzzles are best served raw
[3:11:12] <%dds333a> hence why I miss manuals that had a notes section
[3:11:12] <+Vokkan> love this puzzle
[3:11:12] <%TungstenViper> it's gibberish for now
[3:11:17] <+storebrandcandy> then the pelican tried to eat a capybara
[3:11:18] <Flare3500> I don't think it's nonsense , it makes perfect sense when you read the title which most people miss
[3:11:23] <%dds333a> or manuals period
[3:11:23] <brunoberserk> taking notes , huh ? OLD SCHOOL
[3:11:23] <lostallmyaccs> I always brute forced this puzzle as a kid
[3:11:23] <artoflec> yea i think only silent hill 2 onward has the "memos" page so you dont have to write stuff down
[3:11:24] <ranarath> Yeah, I remember needing two other friends and a paper and pencil to figure this one out.
[3:11:28] <SoaringTrumpet> good thinking, Woolie
[3:11:31] <hereiam407> Its like when my teacher says read all directions before proceeding
[3:11:31] <%TungstenViper> you gotta solve other things first
[3:11:36] <+HumanDoctor> you can waist my time anytime
[3:11:43] <sans_roxanne> You move the middle piece and then just rotate every other piece around in a circle.
[3:11:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> because you would NEVER underthink Kappa
[3:11:52] <dukenux> It's okay to look up solutions to Silent Hill puzzles. It's ALWAYS morally correct
[3:11:54] <+SolGainer> oooh I remember this now
[3:11:55] <%dds333a> no, never LUL
[3:11:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie nailed it right there. You either overthink or get the right amount of thinking in these games THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND.
[3:11:57] <+KrimsonTVN> When I was 15, this was a damn rubix cube to me
[3:12:06] <crudjandall> @cappuccinoguil that's what I thought but the principal just said "do your homework!, or you'll end up like that witchy girl!"
[3:12:10] <SoaringTrumpet> @dukenux noooo

[3:57:02] <majindusto> HUG THEM WALLS
[3:57:09] <+horsesaredumb> god that little bump detail makes the game so much better
[3:57:17] <dukenux> I think you can open the door from this side

[3:58:01] <Voidvas> James cant Wavedash
[3:58:03] <definitelynotjayy> harry is not built for combat
[3:58:04] <KaiserMario> I think they are enjoying the game so far! I'm happy!
[3:58:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> You know, Harry's got a limited moveset, but if you can dial down his movement he's at least mid tier.
[3:58:12] <peachy996> It's Ringu: Terror's Realm Bunny hop but it's something
[3:58:17] <crudjandall> @waltzqueen and all Henry is trying to figure out is "what the hell?"
[3:58:20] <hereiam407> Summon the beast!
[3:58:21] <peachy996> It's no*

[3:58:37] <$oFlooofy> @hereiam407 SH4 soundtrack is damn good atleast it has that going for it LUL
[3:58:39] <XzileGaming> Minmo, growingstrong together
[3:58:41] <TenraiDaze> SH4 has great music, shame the game only used like a quarter of it
[3:58:41] <peachy996> Still a bitch
[3:58:42] <waltzqueen> @crudjandall henry is a shitty joe smoe with no jacket to hold his items. i love and hate him

[3:59:01] <+chiluzza> its the best way to handle children though
[3:59:06] <peachy996> Yeah it's crazy how little of the soundtrack in 4 is used. I think it's really good
[3:59:09] <vavilonica> Woolies brain is surprisingly in sync with Silent Hill bullshit
[3:59:11] <%livlinn> LUL
[3:59:11] <crudjandall> @tenraidaze that's most of the Silent Hill games I think though
[3:59:16] <+horsesaredumb> LUL
[3:59:16] <waltzqueen> @TenraiDaze imagine if they remixed the back half of 4 into one giant level. it could be so much better
[3:59:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @vavilonica He's had Pat talking his ear off about it for decades at this point.
[3:59:30] <%TungstenViper> @waltzqueen YES
[3:59:31] <crudjandall> Shattered Memories soundtrack is like an hour or longer
[3:59:37] <+horsesaredumb> monkaS

[4:03:34] <+KrimsonTVN> Not sure if these renovations are going to bring the school up to code
[4:03:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Compared to SH2, I do actually think I prefer the way transitions work in SH1. You can just walk through a door and bam, you're in it.
[4:03:47] <waltzqueen> @KrimsonTVN it's America, like we have a Code

[4:40:38] <pi_in_the_sci> Is there something written on that locker door?
[4:40:39] <nailwind> the setplay

[4:40:41] <TheProtomanBlues> shame we can see Reggie's face
[4:40:44] <+gpallas> I forgot that bit was in the fcked up school
[4:40:44] <HorribleHog> couldn't let you leave without the key
[4:40:45] <peachy996> HEY BART LOOK AT MY NEW CHAlNSAW
[4:40:48] <Fuji808> For PS1, that's a good jumpscare. Good setup, good fake out, good payoff.
[4:40:48] <+KrimsonTVN> You handling that a LOT better than I did way back when
[4:40:49] <majindusto> So...BORING  GAME, HUH? enigmaKEK
[4:40:50] <stevenellis386> 2 SCURRY FOR ME
[4:40:51] <derap41> These kids look like the baby from Eraser head
[4:40:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> Who did we get? 'em, James... 'em
[4:40:53] <dundore77> should get a bmp monitor
[4:40:54] <Torgue_1> True
[4:40:57] <marshalmorphino22> You see the game lulls you into a false sense of security with a double fakeout. Then it’s pals you in the face and gives you a present.
[4:41:00] <Kokobang> this one is good tho
[4:41:00] <puluxor> But they work when used sparingly
[4:41:01] <ZeeJiggle> Yes, but a GOOD one is a good one.
[4:41:01] <derap41> Its not scary its startling
[4:41:04] <QueequegTheater> HEYBARTCHECKOUTMYNEWCHAINSAWANDHOCKEYMASK
[4:41:04] <jorniev> AND YET
[4:41:05] <ChungusQuest> cheap as free
[4:41:06] <andre11dr> Silent Hill up to some shenanigans
[4:41:06] <%dds333a> yeah, the ones that just jump in your face
[4:41:09] <hereiam407> This had a good setup
[4:41:12] <xerotwo> doodYelp
[4:41:12] <Bennett_Fracture> are you glad that you are wearing your brown pats today reggie...
[4:41:20] <+Bitscreed> A good horror game can have a little jump scare as a treat
[4:41:25] <dukenux> this was like setup with 2 prior fake out jumpcares
[4:41:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> A jumpscare is the punchline to a setup. It's like a joke.
[4:41:26] <derap41> You get ONE
[4:41:27] <Tracazoid> Use every tool in the toolbox, not simply a hammer
[4:41:31] <jorniev> because they need dread before the scare
[4:41:32] <KaiserMario> YEAH, that was 100% earned
[4:41:33] <nailwind> so basically puppetcombo games
[4:41:35] <@Menitta> I'm a fan of that Jumpscare in Until Dawn that's on nothing
[4:41:39] <+cdrom321> "Psycho" was good at it.
[4:41:44] <+pectusumbra> it helps that one there was a very mild one. It's the set up that makes it land
[4:41:45] <Chatterbox1991> FNAF is the one that does it well
[4:41:49] <dinnydanny777> jumpscares with no build up are awful
[4:41:51] <peachy996> Exorcist 3 used their jump scare masterfully
[4:41:56] <@Menitta> Mike freaks out in the shower and there's nothing in there
[4:41:56] <brunoberserk> woolie is right , jumspcares needed to be EARNED
[4:41:59] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Eternal Darkness' jump scare was so good because it was the beginning of the game and than there was nothing else in the mansion for most of the game.
[4:42:01] <%SirGO0SE> Fear had strong ones
[4:42:04] <Calek> Haunting of Hill House has the best jump scare of all time
[4:42:04] <mortificent> Yeap, like Exorcist 3's Jumpscare
[4:42:05] <Tracazoid> Yeah Exorcist 3 earns that jumpscare and it's fantastic
[4:42:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's literally "ha, made ya flinch"
[4:42:11] <jorniev> SPOOKY HOUSE OF JUMPSCARES
[4:42:13] <%brisk_dacat> so no FNAF for woolie
[4:42:19] <%TungstenViper> the jumpscare is a little twist on a good horror mood. using jumpscares as a tool build your horror narrative is dumb
[4:42:21] <derap41> Movies with whisper quiet dialog and loud as jump scraes suck
[4:42:22] <dinnydanny777> I like it when there's no jumpscare just the build up
[4:42:29] <mortificent> Resident Evil usually does pretty good jumpscares
[4:42:36] <%Javaa01> Or in the same vein, spooks that have no other content then just being LOUD NOISES are also shit
[4:42:40] <hereiam407> The Scary Door
[4:42:42] <nailwind> the best is to threaten with a jumpscare and then never do it
[4:42:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> @dinnydanny777 blue balls but for fear
[4:42:52] <dundore77> the worst is when its just normal and the camera turns to like family member standing \and it gives the DUNDUN music tone for no reason other than to make it a scare.
[4:42:54] <%TungstenViper> @nailwind yes
[4:42:58] <dukenux> Locked camera angles are also good way to pull out jumpscares
[4:43:05] <marshalmorphino22> SH3 does jump scares really well
[4:43:06] <+gpallas> lol
[4:43:07] <dukenux> *pull off
[4:43:10] <marshalmorphino22> Especially in the haunted house
[4:43:18] <GeoGio3> nope
[4:43:19] <andre11dr> You gotta build up tension before a jumpdcare ,if all you got is jumpscare because you can't write a interesting word, your story is pretty garbage
[4:43:22] <$oFlooofy> Clang clangclang CLANG
[4:43:26] <$oFlooofy> best music
[4:43:31] <dinnydanny777> @reallybigrocks You are not allowed a jumpscare out of the suspense m6kwpressaD3

[4:55:01] <+croxeye> would a drainage pipe go INSIDE a building? wtf canada :V
[4:55:05] <KaiserMario> That was a drain, where would a drain lead to? INSINDE?!
[4:55:06] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the key went into the toilet PepeLaugh
[4:55:07] <HeroSolaire> hmm water does go down
[4:55:19] <hereiam407> Pipes outside go where?
[4:55:28] <hereiam407> To be fair, this is Silent Hill

[4:55:44] <%dds333a> It do go down
[4:55:55] <HeroSolaire> its drainage water not sewer water btw

[4:56:13] <hereiam407> Please save
[4:56:14] <marshalmorphino22> Good thing Woolie murdered all those children
[4:56:18] <dukenux> logically, there could be a drain grate in the courtyard
[4:56:20] <marshalmorphino22> Or they’d be getting in the way
[4:56:33] <+Bitscreed> @dukenux Does this school look logical to you? ;)
[4:56:36] <dukenux> but this is bullshit nightmare architecture were dealing with
[4:56:38] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the key went to the bottom of the lake GO GET THE SCUBA GEAR
[4:56:38] <chhdez> I heard Woolie stole a pie from Kirby
[4:56:49] <+SolidusRex> Imagine you are in the middle of class and water just starts pouring onto your head from an indoor drainage pipe
[4:56:53] <nailwind> oh no a knee tall chair
[4:56:53] <hereiam407> Underwater Silent Hill gameplay? Hell yeeh
[4:56:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> @chhdez false. He is still alive
[4:57:02] <+AkumaMatataX_X> AkumaMatataX_X subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! LOOOST?
[4:57:03] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> i heard woolie consumed kirby
[4:57:10] <hereiam407> Open World Silent Hill
[4:57:17] <hereiam407> Would be a bad idea
[4:57:20] <rcand9> valtiel vs kirby horror who wins?
[4:57:25] <%dds333a> @greenherbwhitesmoke that's how he gained the knowledge
[4:57:33] <KaiserMario> Siegwoolz of Catarina is stuck on a puzzle, again... "Hmmmm... Oh, I was absorbed in thought, it seems I washed that key away... But where to? Hmmmm..."
[4:57:34] <JDebss> Shit's locked
[4:57:40] <marshalmorphino22> Kirby was shoved into a tight hole and used for hydrodynamics
[4:57:41] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @hereiam407 was that what silent hills was meant to be?
[4:57:45] <HeroSolaire> the original Silent Hill trilogy is already open world tho
[4:57:48] <%dds333a> @kaisermario hmmmmmmmm
[4:57:48] <majindusto> He coud have easily gone through the Courtyard  lol
[4:57:49] <dukenux> @hereiam407 you could make it "open world" like this one, where streets are just blocked off by gaping holes
[4:57:52] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @dds333a too much knowledge or not enough?
[4:57:52] <hereiam407> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke No idea, but probably
[4:58:03] <peachy996> didnt downpour have open world
[4:58:04] <pi_in_the_sci> @hereiam407 Large sections of Evil Within 2 essentially were open world SH, and it was okay
[4:58:13] <hereiam407> @dukenux Yeh, basically.
[4:58:16] <lil_scooby_snack> just stopping in to say let's gooooooo
[4:58:29] <+Bitscreed> Alan Wake was originally intended to be open world before Remedy had to scale it back.
[4:58:32] <cellaccount> is Pachinko game is too advanced for me
[4:58:34] <KaiserMario> @peachy996 Downcoming had I think
[4:58:58] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> downcoming NODDERS
[4:59:00] <SulfurousAcid> oh that's why there's the driving sections @Bitscreed
[4:59:01] <dukenux> with silent hill being a nightmare dimension you could easily justify unlocking previously inacessible areas with story progression
[4:59:07] <majindusto> Explore  Courtyard
[4:59:09] <hereiam407> @pi_in_the_sci Evil Within is more gunplay and action though. Idk how open world would work for Silent Hill, and justify itself being that way. Somebody more creative than me could do it
[4:59:16] <mortificent> Safe COPIUM
[4:59:17] <KaiserMario> Hmmmmmm
[4:59:18] <lostallmyaccs> Silent Hill is the definition of safe

[4:59:27] <%AceNugget> the roof was outside

[5:00:04] <andre11dr> When will Woolie learn that pipes drain outside
[5:00:04] <majindusto> Pipes, huh? enigmaHmm
[5:00:09] <+SolidusRex> Woolie, it's a DRAINAGE pipe
[5:00:10] <marshalmorphino22> But this school recycles rainwater for the showers
[5:00:12] <JDebss> Wait, since when does Woolie play horror games?!?
[5:00:13] <+Jiggisnipe> I sure wouldn't want water flowing inside Kappa
[5:00:13] <hereiam407> Where does rain water go?
[5:00:16] <KaiserMario> These are clearly NOT engineers! LUL
[5:00:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> They drain into the classroom, obviously
[5:00:34] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:00:36] <+SolidusRex> Do they have drainage pipes in Canada?

[5:01:24] <+Bitscreed> I actually admire that Woolie is taking the school's bizarre, otherworldly design into consideration and not assuming the most logical option.
[5:01:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie will... figure it out?
[5:01:27] <%dds333a> alrighty
[5:01:27] <majindusto> BUT HE REFUSED

[5:05:35] <%Javaa01> The Upside Down Stairs
[5:05:36] <waltzqueen> @frostazul doesnt feel cheap to me
[5:05:47] <rcand9> we been to the music room yet chat?
[5:05:47] <KaiserMario> Still not quite a Shadow Puzzle, but figuring out where rain water goes when drained... Oh boy
[5:05:53] <%dds333a> Exasperated LUL

[5:06:55] <lostallmyaccs> I have a cool theory about it but I'll save it for myself haHAA
[5:06:58] <+Jiggisnipe> he was fantastic with the piano but couldn't figure out where water drains
[5:06:58] <andre11dr> RE1 is feels a little hokie, mainly because of the voice acting which is hilarious
[5:07:13] <+flyingtentaclemonster> I think they are doing fine
[5:07:15] <rcand9> music puzzle isn't the worst puzzle in 1 imo that prize goes to one much later
[5:07:21] <hereiam407> Probably
[5:07:30] <andre11dr> Honestly i never thought original RE1 to be that scary
[5:07:30] <%dds333a> @andre11dr IT'S FORREST, OH MY COD
[5:07:34] <JDebss> It's fiiine
[5:07:34] <moogleboy1984> @rcand9 Door to Hell?
[5:07:36] <dundore77> you did stop at it one point but that was 100 rooms entrances ago
[5:07:43] <+Bitscreed> The key/drain puzzle makes perfect sense geographically, logically etc, but the whole reveal of the dark version of the school, stuff being weird and changed about etc would naturally make first time players overthink it.
[5:07:45] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> have they found the room they were showed yet?
[5:07:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, these games REALLY want you to check every little corner for tips.
[5:07:55] <lostallmyaccs> @rcand9 it was for me back in the day
[5:07:56] <+MisterAvry> This game scared the living shit out of me at 11
[5:07:57] <andre11dr> RE Remake is definitely scary
[5:08:01] <+Bitscreed> Especially after the Teletoilets.
[5:08:02] <rcand9> @rcand9 i think thats the one i have in mind

[5:10:01] <+BonerGirl> bad voice acting is all a part of 90s video game charm
[5:10:04] <andre11dr> While the VA is not the best, it's still way better than most PS1 RE games

[5:12:51] <ExpressNode> Sounds like someone banging on a steel filing cabinet
[5:12:58] <andre11dr> Why did they even have to censor it? I imagine one of the countries had a problem with the child murder or something

[5:16:02] <%baka_sugoi> Orb

[5:16:05] <Demie_G> danganropa  grenade
[5:16:05] <%Javaa01> @andre11dr Yeah it's just a cultural faux pas that their rating system considers, same as decapitations in RE games being censored

[5:20:00] <lehvak182> feel like he's making this really difficult for no reason
[5:20:01] <%TungstenViper> it's: Left --> 180-90 , Right --> 90-180

[5:30:45] <chhdez> Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from humanity. And men assumed a fleeting form. These are the roots of our world. Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite... A lie will remain a lie. Young Hollow, knowing this, do you still desire peace?

[5:44:30] <+TopTieramisu> SH2 the GOAT
[5:44:30] <+Bitscreed> Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful film.
[5:44:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> pans labyrinth is great
[5:44:33] <DrkJP520> The old ass sound effects give me the shivers
[5:44:37] <%dds333a> it's not even a horror movie really
[5:44:40] <+maria_luke> are we playing the PSX Game?
[5:44:40] <marshalmorphino22> People hadn’t figured out a formula yet, so things were very creative
[5:44:43] <Bubsla> the older format adds to the atmosphere
[5:44:44] <ChronoRomancer> its not over produced. it does more with less
[5:44:44] <%dds333a> like, at all
[5:44:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> mental damage
[5:44:49] <marshalmorphino22> Forbidden siren is really spooky
[5:44:56] <Bubsla> Vintage is scary
[5:44:57] <+xenoboost> tech limits, made them really focus on atmo and sound design over shiny looks
[5:44:58] <andre11dr> I'd say the sound design, regarding Silent Hill
[5:45:00] <legion0047> pans labyrinith sucks out your soul with good atmosphere and tension
[5:45:00] <%SirGO0SE> pinhead scares me :(
[5:45:01] <Pappajimbo> pans labyrinth had ampoules in it
[5:45:06] <marshalmorphino22> Hands in its eyes is also terrifying
[5:45:10] <+polothegreatest> its just an US senator LUL
[5:45:19] <rcand9> hell yeah
[5:45:21] <dundore77> Atmosphere is great but imo there needs to be a payoff somewhere. Anatomy never has a pay off other than potentially the jumpscare of the game crashing/the organ moment where it falls flat it eventually stops being scary

[5:49:45] <rcand9> the va is pretty good for the time
[5:49:48] <%hereiam407> Its fine for the mood
[5:49:51] <%dds333a> it could be worse, but wait LUL
[5:49:51] <+TopTieramisu> it's not RE1 level bad
[5:49:54] <horriblegoatdemon> Hm, radio
[5:49:55] <dukenux> What is THIS
[5:49:58] <+Jiggisnipe> it's not bad, it's interesting
[5:49:59] <%dds333a> also, sh2 LUL
[5:50:00] <AngryAsian5> The VA isn't as bad as it could be LUL
[5:50:00] <%RyTYoung> SH 2 has waay weirder VA but it works
[5:50:00] <+sherndon226> I think Silent Hill has delibertly weird VA and it shouldn't be held against it. At least 1 - 3
[5:50:01] <lostallmyaccs> It is bad, But it weirdly fitting
[5:50:02] <yukichocomilk> the VA is so flat
[5:50:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's definitely not as bad as Resident Evil 1
[5:50:06] <brunoberserk> the bad one is dahlia
[5:50:07] <dundore77> Its stilted cause the lines load in line by line
[5:50:12] <Ell1ot> what a mansion!
[5:50:14] <dukenux> What do you THINK of IT?
[5:50:18] <%dds333a> JUST A MOMENT
[5:50:21] <+Jiggisnipe> @yukichocomilk yea
[5:50:24] <rcand9> LUL
[5:50:25] <%dds333a> OH MY COD
[5:50:25] <+SolidusRex> There is one VA in this game who is really good
[5:50:28] <unit05_pluto> imo the akwardness of the vas performances  fit the mood of the game
[5:50:28] <+sherndon226> woah, sorry about that darlin
[5:50:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1475753733116076034?t=xDYBW5uS1mTPmSfuKiU8Qg&s=19
[5:50:29] <drunken_lemur> @TopTieramisu The one where the editors literally went word by word, stitching together the "Best" Takes?
[5:50:29] <%hereiam407> Silent Hill is a little flat and stiff, in a good way
[5:50:30] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:50:30] <jett_eyes> voice acting in these games are the so bad its good type of thing
[5:50:32] <dukenux> IT'S FOHREST
[5:50:32] <%dds333a> numb arm LUL
[5:50:35] <+BonerGirl> Woolie and Reggie lookin like characters still locked
[5:50:35] <kes009900> just like Keanu Reaves wouldve done
[5:50:37] <+kewlmyc> Fuck, what was that game called?
[5:50:38] <majindusto> It's  a 1999 game
[5:50:38] <KaiserMario> There's some that are *chef's kiss
[5:50:40] <xerotwo> OH NO I'M FALLING
[5:50:45] <DrkJP520> There was a terrible demon. ouch
[5:50:47] <%RyTYoung> YEAH IT WAS
[5:50:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> YES
[5:50:49] <rcand9> this is true
[5:50:50] <%hereiam407> Yeah
[5:50:51] <horriblegoatdemon> YEP
[5:50:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES
[5:50:52] <rcand9> 100%
[5:50:53] <majindusto> YEP
[5:50:55] <Tracazoid> It was
[5:50:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> T H E L O R E
[5:50:56] <Nabs96> so what's the story w so many of these old games having bad voice acting? did they just get random off the street or was it that English VAs weren't a thing back then?
[5:50:57] <+sherndon226> that's the realest
[5:50:58] <waltzqueen> yep
[5:51:01] <Uncle_Christian> WATCH IT .ITS THE GREATEST
[5:51:02] <legion0047> Remember, Japanese developers
[5:51:03] <%dds333a> The exterior is one to one, yeah
[5:51:04] <+king_of_mystery2> Go look at the comparisons
[5:51:06] <+king_of_mystery2> it's crazy
[5:51:08] <legion0047> they based the school on it
[5:51:10] <%RyTYoung> L O R E woolieF woolieU
[5:51:11] <+SolidusRex> PUT DA COOKIE DOWN
[5:51:12] <%MichaelDood> One of the alltime great references.
[5:51:13] <legion0047> down to what their put on the walls
[5:51:13] <+sherndon226> except for the roof - they didn't have any frames of the roof in the movie so it's a japanese roof
[5:51:14] <horriblegoatdemon> Japanese devs trying to design an American school need a point of reference
[5:51:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @WoolieVersus Everything except the VERY Japanese rooftops, because there are no rooftop scenes in Kindergarten cop.
[5:51:16] <legion0047> and the posters
[5:51:17] <majindusto> The outside  of the school too
[5:51:23] <KaiserMario> It doens't matter if you didn't, but the devs did LUL
[5:51:23] <marshalmorphino22> Who is your daddy? And what does he do?
[5:51:23] <%dds333a> Check out the comparison, the outside is identical
[5:51:25] <rcand9> yep
[5:51:27] <drunken_lemur> @SolidusRex That's Jingle All The Way
[5:51:30] <%RickyRelucent> it might be a tumor
[5:51:33] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus is the most famous easter egg in this game
[5:51:35] <stardream64> Japanese devs and they didnt have good internet
[5:51:36] <Decimated_body> Yup especially all those bullets around very american
[5:51:38] <+SolidusRex> Whoops
[5:51:39] <rcand9> persona school this is not
[5:51:39] <lostallmyaccs> They share some posters
[5:51:39] <%baka_sugoi> merica
[5:51:44] <%RyTYoung> ITS A FERRET
[5:51:44] <dundore77> Yeah and Silent Hill is somewhat based on the town Centralia in Pennsylvania thats constantly on fire due to a fire bursting out in the coal mines under it
[5:51:47] <ExpressNode> Anime has conditioned us
[5:51:49] <Uncle_Christian> ITS SKOOL
[5:51:56] <Nabs96> in my school we used to have the grade number and then a colour. so Grade 9 Blue for example.
[5:52:05] <waltzqueen> @dundore77 that was retconned in. it is not in sh 1-4
[5:52:09] <%dds333a> @nabs96 it's a case by case basis
[5:52:20] <+sherndon226> no do everything
[5:52:20] <Bubsla> Forbidden siren is interesting
[5:52:21] <+sherndon226> right now
[5:52:21] <rcand9> siren 2 is super hard i hear
[5:52:22] <Chatterbox1991> Forbidden Siren is the SHIT
[5:52:25] <lostallmyaccs> Gimme da cookie! - Arnold
[5:52:33] <%SirGO0SE> @Nabs96 we had that but they did away with it because we were smart enough to figure out the colors were segregating us by test scores
[5:52:34] <%dds333a> shoukd be done within a few
[5:52:35] <%hereiam407> Capped some ghost kids
[5:52:37] <%RyTYoung> Some one said you're 35% through
[5:52:37] <+gyabs> killed some dogs.
[5:52:38] <stardream64> Silent Hill is not based off of Centralia, that is only the case for the movie version of the location
