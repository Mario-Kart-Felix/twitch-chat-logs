[0:14:33] <Arqartur0> I have to respect people that do that, it's quite a lot of work
[0:14:39] <%Feralspirit41> I did something like that and ended up with a mullet
[0:14:43] <%DashXero> That's why I only rock the shaved head.
[0:14:47] <unboundsoul358> where is the manga at rn?

[0:19:13] <%pennykettle_> I hung out with my 2yo niece all Thanksgiving, it was a dope excuse to dodge family
[0:19:15] <youngking_kush> The internet be so quick to tell people to ex-communicate their family lol
[0:19:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Whoa are Woolie and I from the same family LUL
[0:19:25] <dai_tonight> Here in latinamerica we don‚Äôt really do the ‚ÄúENTIRE family is here!‚Äù thing.
[0:19:36] <%illicitdonut> That sucks to hear Woolie. It took the very real threat of my brother losing his job before he got his done.
[0:19:37] <%pennykettle_> My Qanon aunt isn't invited to Christmas this year because she wont get vaccinated. She's waiting for Trump to take control back
[0:19:43] <+The_Devil_Breaker> @youngking_kush Family is far less important than people think
[0:19:44] <mrtanaka111> @dai_tonight we dont?
[0:19:45] <dai_tonight> Mostly just our immediate family.
[0:19:49] <NeroInfinite> Sometiems ya just gotta cut yourself away from problem fmaily memebers.

[0:20:25] <Duskendawn> Cue vin diesel family meme
[0:20:30] <mrtanaka111> family...family...family...
[0:20:34] <derap41> So Woolie has to yearly fight a conversion ritual
[0:20:34] <youngking_kush> @the_devil_breaker That's true but I dont think ex-communication should just be the go to y'know
[0:20:35] <RickyRelucent> Vim Deeble
[0:20:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @pennykettle_ Would she vote for Senator Armstrong?
[0:20:39] <%X2Eliah> @youngking_kush eh, yes and no. Western cultures really devalue familiy a lot, for too much

[0:22:06] <%patriotrenegade> Woolie, if Reggie starts to do it first time you have our permission to slap the controller out of his hands

[0:34:14] <%debrv> Remember the Fair Lady Reg?
[0:34:27] <RickyRelucent> did reggie ever do anything with the fair lady?
[0:34:40] <RedCycloneInc> There's something about rolling in DS1 I think you might not know, it's that it restricts your directional rolling somewhat
[0:34:43] <RickyRelucent> other then presumely talk
[0:34:44] <+pectusumbra> @RickyRelucent no, he switched to grave lord but he can go back later
[0:34:51] <%xcompleasedad> yo

[0:34:55] <%CateHecate> blown up
[0:35:01] <Bonebagmel> look at how much our boy has grown
[0:35:04] <dai_tonight> @rickyrelucent they just chatted a bit
[0:35:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PARRY GOD PARRY GOD
[0:35:11] <Duskendawn> IIRC reg is currently still in gravelord covenant?
[0:35:11] <+oz_suka> our boi got gud
[0:35:12] <%ozzrabbit> Now watch every other summon sign have some goober with the Yellow Skirt
[0:35:15] <RedCycloneInc> So it's not all Reggie but mostly Reggie
[0:35:16] <agustorm123> Parrrrry
[0:35:23] <%xcompleasedad> OK, dead serious, do you think he can take them within the first ten tries?
[0:35:23] <+0neReeler> check those corners
[0:35:25] <%pennykettle_> Reg will have to get used to this run
[0:35:36] <%DapperCadavr> that wide swing is so cool
[0:35:41] <%X2Eliah> @xcompleasedad 1st attempt, guaranteed
[0:35:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reggie is gonna annihilate Sekiro

[0:36:03] <%Feralspirit41> smooth
[0:36:03] <%xcompleasedad> Silver Knights have NO CHANCE
[0:36:05] <+mechslayer71> not even hearing the sound LUL
[0:36:05] <haitakaa> vasectomy pole
[0:36:06] <%CateHecate> reggie is in fighting games mode considering how instant he is hitting the riposte after parry lol LUL
[0:36:09] <Duskendawn> Right in the dicks

[0:36:24] <agustorm123> Reggie 3/3 parries
[0:36:29] <+oz_suka> straight up leveled up
[0:36:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm at work but I hope I get home before he beats o+s
[0:36:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> run in run out?
[0:36:38] <Oleai> Silver Knights are where a lot of people learned to parry. And riposting on frame 1 of the parry denies the sound effect. GJ
[0:36:46] <RickyRelucent> @KeiganOfAstora odds r u will
[0:36:48] <pepinillomaton> demons like fire
[0:36:49] <%CateHecate> reggie totally downloaded this game way faster than i think anyone expected
[0:36:50] <%pennykettle_> He will do too much damage to O&S, he will get it done fast
[0:36:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I know u can't parry Slam, but can you parry Jam?
[0:37:05] <fantom_flasch> big clips
[0:37:19] <Pubstar_LTD> @BallerSwagBro9k no
[0:37:20] <dai_tonight> The poll should be about which one he kills first
[0:37:21] <DSD24> Ouch
[0:37:24] <%X2Eliah> ya you can
[0:37:26] <haitakaa> reggie needs to learn the joys of a quick roll
[0:37:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> pole v pole
[0:37:34] <%Juriasu> what was that animation
[0:37:38] <hawmaro95> overhead
[0:37:40] <ALvl78Zapdos> LUL
[0:37:41] <%unboundsoul358> did reggie ever get grass crest?
[0:37:41] <dude_bruhh> that weapon is a toilet seat on a stick - prove me wrong
[0:37:46] <DSD24> Imagine how cool he'd be with both legs
[0:37:47] <PunkZedB> his pole is bigger than yours
[0:37:49] <Duskendawn> Man that poise is too much
[0:37:59] <DSD24> @dude_bruhh Its a inward bent tuning fork
[0:38:01] <RyuuAoi> Did Reggie ever get the Great Soul Arrows?
[0:38:07] <+oz_suka> fighting the demon like a monster hunter fight
[0:38:09] <Jickiechan> kumite kumite
[0:38:10] <youngking_kush> This room suuuuuuuccckks
[0:38:15] <%CateHecate> technically this one demon has been way harder for reggie than Capra LUL
[0:38:19] <RickyRelucent> @DSD24 I think its used for people
[0:38:39] <+Stupid121v2> that tail
[0:38:48] <%pennykettle_> Did y'all see that video on the new Kalameet speedrun tech
[0:38:52] <+thecosmicfly> howd this gu get in here
[0:38:55] <%unboundsoul358> LET'S GO
[0:38:56] <ALvl78Zapdos> EZ
[0:38:57] <PunkZedB> the only thing this room is missing is two dogs to gank you with the demon
[0:38:58] <twoto858> NICE
[0:38:58] <+Stupid121v2> smooth
[0:38:59] <Bonebagmel> SeemsGood
[0:39:00] <$eco419> You‚Ä¶did it
[0:39:00] <LunarRemix> That's probably the worst one
[0:39:01] <+oz_suka> remember the two hand technique
[0:39:02] <DSD24> We still got new tech?! @pennykettle_
[0:39:02] <RedCycloneInc> ifcMatrix

[0:39:15] <%hax_metatron> I WAS THE REWARD
[0:39:17] <DSD24> Its the box from Kuon
[0:39:17] <pepinillomaton> yey
[0:39:21] <%CateHecate> just like steve harvey woulda done
[0:39:28] <sendart> kindle more
[0:39:29] <%AbnormalVoid> it's fun to think about what the significance of that guy being there would be
[0:39:30] <glass_marcus> kindle
[0:39:30] <LunarRemix> An another humanity to burn
[0:39:32] <dai_tonight> dimondo titanaito
[0:39:32] <+Awkward_Cyborg> might as well kindle
[0:39:34] <+devonoel> kindle more
[0:39:35] <Johannen> could even kindle
[0:39:36] <Crownaux0> yea kindle again with that humanity
[0:39:37] <BurdRightsActivist> kin
[0:39:37] <a_mad_dragon_> KINDLE
[0:39:38] <Artiamus> \|o|/
[0:39:38] <Duskendawn> Megidolapole
[0:39:39] <%X2Eliah> helmet doesnt fit
[0:39:49] <primaryfire> plague HATES it
[0:39:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:39:50] <dai_tonight> Helmet don‚Äôt fir
[0:39:51] <+kevlarkoala> lets see if he can parry his way through twice. once can be a fluke, twice is skill
[0:39:52] <RyuuAoi> Should be boar head
[0:39:53] <RickyRelucent> he could go more stone
[0:39:54] <hawmaro95> I cant wait for the confidence shattering wall
[0:39:55] <%Prevot> that helmet does not fit
[0:39:58] <dai_tonight> boar helmet
[0:39:58] <urkleturtle> you know what helmet is shiny? the boar one
[0:39:58] <RickyRelucent> get some darkwraith in there
[0:39:59] <ShadowArcangel> Hope everyone's is having a good day!
[0:39:59] <DSD24> Havel needs another Armor Coating like Halo
[0:40:01] <+profanityincluded> the pig was the luck, change my mind
[0:40:01] <+Stupid121v2> fashion souls is the real game
[0:40:03] <%hax_metatron> THE BOAR HELMET with that set would be Kreygasm
[0:40:04] <Xaeveax> Like the boar helmet
[0:40:04] <%mihokspawn> Steel hellmet
[0:40:05] <+robertoszek> boar helmet is shiny
[0:40:05] <%X2Eliah> boar head is a helmet
[0:40:07] <+BananaSlammuh> satisfied with Woolie half praise
[0:40:08] <bacon_209> kindle
[0:40:08] <jorniev> DEFINETLY
[0:40:10] <%holydeviant1> Boar head would be better for fashion, unironically
[0:40:11] <legacy0117> SwiftRage PJSalt Dunked that salt beast.
[0:40:12] <$eco419> Woolie is jealous of Reggie fashion
[0:40:17] <glass_marcus> Havel helmet is bad with most things
[0:40:19] <dai_tonight> Sandpaper on that helmet
[0:40:19] <%cubbywolf> woolieGIRLS
[0:40:20] <IzanagiNoOokami> Boar Helmet matches Silver Knight y'know.
[0:40:23] <%Rafoki> The boar helm would actually look better LUL
[0:40:25] <RedCycloneInc> or go full Havel
[0:40:25] <PunkZedB> yee yee as helmet
[0:40:30] <Xaeveax> Actual parry god
[0:40:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DSD24 kill 500 black knights to unlock a slightly different shade of blue
[0:40:36] <RickyRelucent> People like neat looking characters
[0:40:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> shouldn't he use that humanity to kindle again?
[0:40:38] <kk44man> i actually dig what reggie is rocking lol
[0:40:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PARRY THE WORLD
[0:40:40] <fantom_flasch> havel armor kinda looks ass tbh
[0:40:42] <gespenstkick> Un-fashion is good too. Beat gods looking like a crazy hobo.
[0:40:43] <dai_tonight> Gwyn is DONE
[0:40:47] <ALvl78Zapdos> gwyn is FUCKED
[0:40:48] <%Deekman> he should go kindle that bonfire
[0:40:51] <NeroInfinite> he already kindled
[0:40:51] <%jepupu> I really dislike the havel head
[0:40:53] <%pennykettle_> @DSD24 yeah new stuff as of last month I think, certain blindspots + sorceries + camera manipulation to spawn a health bar above kalameet's head to keep track of where he is = kill kalameet without gough shooting him
[0:40:55] <%CateHecate> using the titanite catch pole to pick your dreads
[0:40:58] <GeoGio3> Gwyn is gonna be so easy damn
[0:40:59] <%Deekman> @NeroInfinite twice
[0:41:01] <Spearweaver> is silver knight armor being that shiny a remastered thing? I remember it being duller in prepare to die. Or am I just crazy?
[0:41:07] <%cubbywolf> Tall boi is thicc
[0:41:09] <pepinillomaton> plin plin plan intensifies
[0:41:11] <DSD24> @ReallyBigRocks the only difference is that there is yellow lights instead of blue lights this time
[0:41:14] <Dabrikishaw> @pennykettle_ Oh wow, nice discovery
[0:41:17] <Xaeveax> @Spearweaver There's a lot that got shinier in remaster
[0:41:17] <%cubbywolf> aw man no more boar helm
[0:41:18] <Duskendawn> Yeah not a fan of havel helm
[0:41:18] <glass_marcus> Instant reposte is sexy tho
[0:41:21] <+Mkingston> robbot2Steam heeeyy Gwyn
[0:41:22] <DSD24> @pennykettle_ Man that's really cool
[0:41:22] <%holydeviant1> I went full havel + moss greatshield + gravelord sword so I'm not gonna call out anyone's fashion
[0:41:24] <%X2Eliah> spiral staircase is old, no?
[0:41:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DSD24 :O woah
[0:41:28] <bacon_209> kindle
[0:41:30] <%unboundsoul358> Reggie should put on all the brightly colored equipment. Xanthous helm, red Sealer's body, Lord's blade pants.
[0:41:31] <+Mendin> You have a good halfsecond between the parry and riposte, you can react on-hit instead of pre-queueing it all like you normally
[0:41:37] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[0:41:38] <gespenstkick> baited
[0:41:39] <DSD24> Stinger
[0:41:48] <%cubbywolf> thank you stairs
[0:41:51] <dai_tonight> The gwyn fight will be full of YOOOs
[0:41:56] <Duskendawn> !! HUBRIS !!
[0:41:57] <Spearweaver> @Spearweaver I see. Not a fan tbh
[0:41:57] <LunarRemix> You cannot parry and riposte on stairs.
[0:42:03] <dai_tonight> Ok nevermind
[0:42:07] <+TheFrancix> yoo nice
[0:42:08] <youngking_kush> I didnt even know you could Riposte that fast until I saw Reggie do it
[0:42:09] <%unboundsoul358> they drop dragonslayer arrows?
[0:42:13] <Louie_Salmon> Always with the rare drops
[0:42:13] <dai_tonight> REGGIE HE HAS THE HIGH GROUND
[0:42:14] <maskedmustelid> Arrow'd!
[0:42:18] <legacy0117> He has the High ground!
[0:42:19] <NeroInfinite> yeah
[0:42:19] <fantom_flasch> @spearweaver they definitely polished a lot of armors in remastered
[0:42:21] <%hax_metatron> TIME FOR FUCK
[0:42:21] <Crownaux0> look, progress

[0:42:43] <DSD24> Giant Bois
[0:42:43] <RickyRelucent> well, there could be
[0:42:44] <%Juriasu> it's almost time
[0:42:44] <velgaduere> don't forget y'all, Lautrec comes first
[0:42:47] <CrowbarFacelift> massive man
[0:42:48] <agustorm123> Reggie taking his time
[0:42:51] <PunkZedB> giant giants
[0:42:52] <RickyRelucent> But you're not alive
[0:42:52] <%CateHecate> da bois da bois da bois
[0:42:54] <Xaeveax> @velgaduere Vengeance!
[0:42:56] <Crownaux0> quivering intensifies
[0:42:58] <DSD24> No Giant Dad Sadly
[0:42:59] <%X2Eliah> Nah Lautrec is cool, he is Reggie's bro
[0:43:00] <%unboundsoul358> reggie missed the signature nooooo
[0:43:01] <dai_tonight> Big bois
[0:43:01] <%hax_metatron> QUIVERING TIME
[0:43:04] <%mr_sups> This is where I farm
[0:43:10] <+warlockwithapixie> Time for GIANT?
[0:43:12] <%cubbywolf> I remember this from ds3, its been awhile since ds1
[0:43:13] <youngking_kush> Time for: Karmic Justice
[0:43:16] <%holydeviant1> Does he have the black orb ON him?
[0:43:16] <hawmaro95> shoudln't the crack orb activate here?
[0:43:20] <%Rafoki> Snacks and Oreos will be last, we got a lot to do first
[0:43:22] <%holydeviant1> Or is it in the box
[0:43:25] <%cubbywolf> go through the hole
[0:43:25] <NeroInfinite> the party hole
[0:43:26] <%pennykettle_> yeah a bit closer down to the floor
[0:43:26] <Duskendawn> He has the orb
[0:43:27] <RickyRelucent> i actually meant solaire
[0:43:29] <DSD24> @hawmaro95 I think it needs to be a bit closer
[0:43:32] <Deko_> i think it activates in the lower part
[0:43:33] <RickyRelucent> but lautrec too i guess
[0:43:33] <%cubbywolf> it must be explored

[0:50:11] <haitakaa> keep looking
[0:50:12] <privatecorgi> Completely forgot this is how you get boss weapons in DS1
[0:50:14] <dai_tonight> How does the giant know how to make a manus weapon ü§®ü§®ü§®
[0:50:15] <legacy0117> BOSS WEAPONSSSSS!
[0:50:15] <sendart> need to have the right weapon for it to show up
[0:50:15] <primaryfire> @subjectg wild, I don't remember ever seeing a spoiler menu lmao
[0:50:18] <%Lion_kun> Mods ban game. Game is spoiling.
[0:50:19] <%pennykettle_> It would only be a real spoiler if it said the name of a friendly character LUL
[0:50:19] <+Tuffty> It's just names chat, means nothing at this stage, calm down
[0:50:20] <%debrv> Go down the list Reg!
[0:50:31] <%X2Eliah> correct
[0:50:45] <glass_marcus> Well he's heard some of those names before
[0:50:46] <haitakaa> moonlight greatsword
[0:50:48] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> fyi, boss souls can be used from storage box, just gotta have the base weapon in inventory
[0:50:50] <sendart> did he eat the moonlight butterfly soul
[0:50:51] <%X2Eliah> or go normal +15
[0:50:52] <dai_tonight> yeh but why would you want to
[0:50:52] <+jacqueblacqued> dark souls fans are straight psychotic about spoilers
[0:50:55] <Duskendawn> Is the spoiler thing only in the remaster? I don't remember this showing up
[0:50:55] <primaryfire> love the wooden hammer detail
[0:51:04] <%pennykettle_> no its in the og too @Duskendawn
[0:51:05] <%Finnmac5> I just got here, have we gotten to the two boys yet chat?
[0:51:05] <reasonance> it shows every boss weapon for which you have an eligible +10 weapon to upgrade from, but because catalysts can't be upgraded ALL of them show up just from having any catalyst
[0:51:09] <hawmaro95> doesn't have the moonlight butterfly soul? doesn't that upgrade spears?
[0:51:09] <%trigunstar26> @2vibe2check Because he got the tin catylist
[0:51:10] <+profanityincluded> tinktititink
[0:51:11] <Johannen> Dont you need a +5 weapon for modification? +10 would not work , right?
[0:51:16] <dai_tonight> @jacqueblacqued pretty sure we‚Äôre only joking
[0:51:18] <Duskendawn> Wow that's really dumb
[0:51:20] <+2Vibe2Check> @trigunstar26 oh I see, thanks
[0:51:23] <DSD24> There's that cool Quelogg sword
[0:51:25] <%Lion_kun> Is there a DS1 boss weapon that doesn't suck?
[0:51:26] <%Theycallmenerf> Have we gotten to the boss?
[0:51:32] <%unboundsoul358> @Johannen +10 for bosses, I think some go at +10. Lightning being one.
[0:51:36] <subjectg> @lion_kun chaos blade, kinda?
[0:51:36] <primaryfire> the giant is gonna have trouble with a fire ember when he uses a wooden hammer
[0:51:37] <haitakaa> chest
[0:51:38] <reasonance> @Lion_kun furysword's good
[0:51:39] <jett_eyes> Forge He Can. Strong, He Am.

[0:51:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Theycallmenerf not yet
[0:51:45] <%X2Eliah> @Johannen mm idk, I needed a +10 to turn into queelaags furysword
[0:51:47] <sporeian94> THE LEGEND NEVER DIES
[0:51:48] <%debrv> @lion_kun Artorias' Blade is a good one.
[0:51:51] <elshadow7> @woolieversus Chest behind giant blacksmith
[0:51:54] <%Theycallmenerf> @cobalt_phoenix_ LETS GOOOO
[0:51:58] <$eco419> Woolie the liar
[0:52:03] <dai_tonight> Sif‚Äôs shield is pretty good
[0:52:06] <Scorchfield> you have to have the weapon, not the soul i think
[0:52:08] <QuadraticGravity> It's because it's a Catalyst
[0:52:13] <DrkJP520> Has he seen the boss in this area?
[0:52:15] <%Lion_kun> 3/20 boss souls gotcha lol
[0:52:22] <dai_tonight> @drkjp520 nope
[0:52:22] <Johannen> Yeah, boss weapon are +10 for sure, was talking about normal fire and divine enhacments
[0:52:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DrkJP520 no
[0:52:28] <mikesapartment> garghoulie
[0:52:28] <subjectg> i hear the crystal ring shield used to be really good
[0:52:31] <primaryfire> bat demon
[0:52:32] <+2Vibe2Check> Woolie trying real hard to not say "get the shortcut" LUL
[0:52:34] <%Rafoki> If you have the 10+weapon it uses it shows the evolution I think
[0:52:40] <%CateHecate> Dragon Bone Fist has A strength scaling and still swings fast, so that's cool
[0:52:42] <LunarRemix> It shows all viable weapons for transformation. Since Catalysts can't be upgraded they're viable to become boss weapons at default
[0:52:46] <Artiamus> Damn he hits hard.
[0:52:49] <QuadraticGravity> @subjectg Pretty sure they nerfed the shit out of the projectile it has
[0:52:51] <Tony2Dirty> You gotta have the weapon not the soul
[0:52:54] <Deko_> shortcut porn Kreygasm
[0:52:54] <%hax_metatron> Batwing Demons, which I still thing is a cool name for a Saturday morning cartoon
[0:52:57] <Forkeye> dont die
[0:53:04] <DSD24> Nice backdash
[0:53:23] <%X2Eliah> hnestly it *should* be the other way, having souls hould show all options
[0:53:28] <Johannen> Should Reggie make the Moonlight Shield?
[0:53:35] <%brandt_connors> damn i missed the archers
[0:53:42] <%thotbane> @hax_metatron What the fuck is even their lore?
[0:53:42] <Deko_> farry
[0:53:43] <+pectusumbra> now that's found it, you may want to tell reggie some of the options of the souls he has @WoolieVersus
[0:53:49] <%unboundsoul358> @Johannen I checked, Moonlight shield is all around worse than magic crest in every way.l
[0:53:50] <Deko_> fatty* LUL
[0:53:53] <nxflre> @brandt_connors that was last week actrually
[0:53:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:29:08] <yukichocomilk> worst choice
[1:29:09] <glass_marcus> It is still november
[1:29:09] <agustorm123> LUL
[1:29:09] <CatRidder> you have two ring slots
[1:29:09] <%DapperCadavr> he says that now lol
[1:29:10] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Don't worry, Reggie, you can FAP anytime. No one's judging.
[1:29:10] <+jacqueblacqued> reject woolie, embrace FAP
[1:29:10] <+yuribo26> Literally the best ring in the game
[1:29:10] <+Shishi1205> too good for fap?
[1:29:11] <+oz_suka> USE IT
[1:29:12] <%DashXero> * Kappa
[1:29:12] <FuumetsuKuroi> Nooooo
[1:29:14] <%pennykettle_> Reggie doesnt need it
[1:29:14] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> acting like theres only 1 ring slot
[1:29:15] <Scorchfield> eh, your loss
[1:29:16] <oak120> woolie leads reggie astray once again
[1:29:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Old McReggarth had a farm
[1:29:17] <dai_tonight> Noooo
[1:29:18] <%Prevot> it's still No Fap November guys
[1:29:19] <digaogrunge> RUINED
[1:29:20] <agustorm123> Reggie want to go full hog
[1:29:20] <+Bitscreed> "Reggarth has no ring. Reggarth NEEDS no ring."
[1:29:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its the best
[1:29:22] <+BananaSlammuh> Woolie wants him to struggle after that unarmed backstab
[1:29:24] <%Theycallmenerf> THERE ARE TWO RING SLOTS
[1:29:25] <%Fefe41> Giant dad shaking his head
[1:29:26] <+RJay80> Reggie commits to No Nut November
[1:29:27] <Duskendawn> You have 10 fingers Kappa
[1:29:29] <RickyRelucent> reggie you're fatrolling in silver knights, go for the sta and hp : 3
[1:29:29] <CatRidder> no nut November
[1:29:30] <%cubbywolf> if he needed it he would fap it
[1:29:32] <%Theycallmenerf> TWO RING SLOTS
[1:29:32] <+Stupid121v2> Woolie correct
[1:29:34] <BigChiefBear> if you cant survive without FAP then you dont desrve FAP
[1:29:35] <primaryfire> fair
[1:29:35] <DarknessHS> FAP denied FeelsBadMan
[1:29:36] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie straight up said it was the 2nd best ring
[1:29:36] <%pennykettle_> let him handicap himself chat
[1:29:37] <%BisoromiBear> journalist mode ring
[1:29:37] <%PlagueOfGripes> a lot of rings are situationally useful. I don't bother using the FAP most of the time for that reason
[1:29:37] <@Solidus_113> use lighter armour and remove havels, it's not a problem
[1:29:38] <justcallmebobplease> WOOLIE THE RAILROADER, I FAP'd the first time and I liked it, since I swapped the OTHER slot!
[1:29:38] <RickyRelucent> thats extra equip isn't doing anything
[1:29:38] <+Stormiercashew> No FAP reggarth
[1:29:42] <velgaduere> best to just put it on now and take it off immediately to remove the choice
[1:29:42] <TheyCallMeVawn> Literally 2nd best ring
[1:29:43] <Xaeveax> The Ring of Fanciness is the best in the game
[1:29:43] <+yuribo26> THIS IS THE RING OF FANCYNESS
[1:29:45] <%Theycallmenerf> JUST EXCHANGE HAVELS FOR WHEVENER YOU NEED IT
[1:29:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> For fuck's sake. You can take it off and get a second one if you really want to put it back on. For fuck's sake guys.......
[1:29:47] <+jacqueblacqued> ring of drip
[1:29:52] <youngking_kush> There's not a better ring lol

[1:29:56] <Zebroneath> Don't want to restrict your options too early
[1:29:57] <yukichocomilk> it's ok wedon't need reggie stronger
[1:29:57] <DrkJP520> What if you find a WAP ring later?
[1:29:58] <+oz_suka> YOU SCARED HIM OFF WOOLIE
[1:29:58] <subjectg> FAP is very good for midrollers, so if you don‚Äôt give a shit about that it‚Äôs good
[1:30:00] <agustorm123> Is besto ring
[1:30:01] <DSD24> @mechslayer71 Not yet

[1:30:02] <+Exicuren> FAPvel
[1:30:03] <zhenthrim213> rock hard FAP
[1:30:03] <oak120> @mechslayer71 no
[1:30:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mechslayer71 almost
[1:30:05] <%pennykettle_> Woolie telling Reggie it's his decision, chat acting like Woolie railroaded him................
[1:30:05] <+eanscrale> FAP with Havel
[1:30:05] <FuumetsuKuroi> Woolie doesn't wanna fap
[1:30:06] <sporeian94> THE LEGEND WILL NEVER DIE
[1:30:06] <%Theycallmenerf> GOD DAMN IT WOOLIE
[1:30:08] <+mechslayer71> thanks guys
[1:30:08] <Ros_Bef> Still november
[1:30:08] <+Jiggisnipe> @KeiganOfAstora and a new player knows that how?
[1:30:09] <Johannen> But what about the Serpents rings thou?
[1:30:10] <OfficerMods> it's not like reggie is struggling
[1:30:13] <OfficerMods> he doesn't NEED fap
[1:30:14] <+profanityincluded> wait he came out with 20 estus
[1:30:14] <%Fefe41> Stamina health endurance EVERYTHIGN YOU'LL EVER WANT
[1:30:16] <KaiserMario> Like wood grain
[1:30:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> NINJA FLIP
[1:30:20] <%strakillias> The only ring that Reggarth cares for is the enemy's brown ring which he is about to blow out
[1:30:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Jiggisnipe They don't but I'm telling Woolie so he can tell Reggie not to worry about it so muhc
[1:30:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> sacrifice the mix&match
[1:30:24] <subjectg> Fog ring LUL
[1:30:24] <TheyCallMeVawn> If you have a fast roll
[1:30:26] <OfficerMods> but just take off havel
[1:30:27] <$eco419> ?
[1:30:28] <%Theycallmenerf> TWO RING SLOTS
[1:30:30] <%Grimlockfly> Reggie is already passed where he needs to be invisible, lol
[1:30:31] <DarknessHS> its just one slot man
[1:30:32] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah the ninja flip ring is a thing
[1:30:33] <+pectusumbra> Aka shut up chat
[1:30:33] <RickyRelucent> flip ring, red tear glass cannon mode, sta regen ring
[1:30:33] <+Shishi1205> you can't use 2 rings
[1:30:34] <+kevlarkoala> you can look at them: just remove Havel lmao
[1:30:34] <TheyCallMeVawn> You can just take off havels then
[1:30:35] <+Sir_Louis> Chloranthy ring very pog
[1:30:35] <oak120> the havel ring is not glued to your finger man
[1:30:37] <Xaeveax> I say ignore FAP for a first run
[1:30:37] <primaryfire> wood grain is pretty easy to miss tho
[1:30:37] <%cubbywolf> Sir Reggarth thought long and HARD about FAPing. He decided, for now, he was good. He needn't get harder than he already was. Indeed he might burst if he got ANY harder
[1:30:38] <bosssbatttle> Two ring slots
[1:30:38] <velgaduere> c o n t e n t
[1:30:38] <wqorst> woolie just wants to stop reggie from getting any stronger
[1:30:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And if you take off havels your have to redo your whole outfit
[1:30:39] <+Vigonept> yeah but two slots tho
[1:30:39] <BurdRightsActivist> NOT IN THIS GAME
[1:30:39] <yukichocomilk> reject content, embrace FAP
[1:30:40] <RickyRelucent> ring for durability on weapons
[1:30:41] <%pennykettle_> CHAT CHILL THE FUCK OUT woolieSPICE
[1:30:42] <+eanscrale> I'd honestly ditch the havel for fap for how much it does
[1:30:44] <hawmaro95> 4 ring slots, the one thing DS2 did right
[1:30:44] <Scorchfield> you can alwasy take off havel and wear lighter stuff
[1:30:46] <elshadow7> Teleport's a bit much
[1:30:46] <%Theycallmenerf> NO FUCK YOU
[1:30:47] <slackerunchained> Has Reg met O&S, yet?
[1:30:47] <$eco419> You can just take of Havel wtf
[1:30:48] <dude_bruhh> calamity ring Kappa

[1:30:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cubbywolf bless you
[1:30:52] <rommlll> haha chat goes brr
[1:30:53] <%holydeviant1> Relax, chat. Reggie is strong enough as it is
[1:30:53] <+Jiggisnipe> @KeiganOfAstora Woolie said it was the 2nd best ring, he didn't yell PUT IT ON like chat is doing, stop
[1:30:54] <privatecorgi> Do the thing or I will literally cry and shit myself
[1:30:56] <%Theycallmenerf> SALTY RN
[1:30:56] <Duskendawn> Reggie doesn't FAP just leave him be LUL
[1:30:58] <agustorm123> You still have more fingers
[1:31:01] <CledusUnleashed> how far are they in this game?
[1:31:01] <+Shishi1205> no dunking yet
[1:31:02] <CatRidder> you can look at them because two ring slots
[1:31:03] <velgaduere> chat's a buncha bitches, as usual lobosKek
[1:31:04] <Blank9> To be fair you can just take havel off lol
[1:31:05] <QuadraticGravity> This is why Reggie only has 26 strength Woolie
[1:31:08] <%cubbywolf> @cobalt_phoenix_ my erotic fanfic soon
[1:31:10] <ursusbearrammage> they forgot the fire keepers soul
[1:31:10] <+Shishi1205> maybe those guys will change his mind
[1:31:11] <agustorm123> Come on and slam
[1:31:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Jiggisnipe I'm not telling him to put it on though like everyone else. Pay attention dude
[1:31:13] <gespenstkick> Chat becomes the catacoms lost souls yet again
[1:31:14] <dude_bruhh> FAP ring is for noobs anyways, Reggie is god
[1:31:17] <digaogrunge> you have 2 ring slots woolie, you can always take one of the rings off, your reasoning is nuts
[1:31:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm just giving info for reference
[1:31:21] <Elliott_TF> I feel like woolie is explaining to chat now, not reggie
[1:31:21] <enerkaizer> hold on, when did reggies flask restock? he only had 19 before he invaded
[1:31:23] <%ekodrop> it's still november
[1:31:25] <%CaptainBeird> can we stop with the outrage on both sides please?
[1:31:27] <OfficerMods> c'mon every body its time to slam now
[1:31:28] <DrkJP520> Each Firekeeper Soul has unique descriptions.
[1:31:29] <slackerunchained> Let's see if Luck *Remains* a skill... :P
[1:31:30] <%CodenameChaz> I see souls game chat is once again devolving into "New person playing needs to have the exact same experience I had or else"
[1:31:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> @enerkaizer Get one back for kiling Lautrec
[1:31:34] <klooswep> Real OGs run around naked with a sack on their heads
[1:31:37] <%holydeviant1> It's so funny to me that chat screams about unoptimal play yet Reggie has never been really walled since Taurus
[1:31:40] <agustorm123> Woolie is making a Pat
[1:31:42] <SunsetJack> You should warn Reggie about NOT using that firelink soul.
[1:31:42] <NumbF4ke> Don't forget firekeeper soul
[1:31:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> did he read the fire keeper soul??
[1:31:44] <FuumetsuKuroi> Rock solid left
[1:31:45] <enerkaizer> @KeiganOfAstora ah, thanks for the answer
[1:31:45] <velgaduere> ???
[1:31:48] <$eco419> Hell no the ring reasoning is dumb
[1:31:49] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[1:31:51] <%fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[1:31:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat let's be honest, reggie's build is just fine and will only get better, the ring is nothing at this point
[1:31:55] <OfficerMods> *distant* its your chance do you dance....
[1:31:56] <%debrv> It's a BALLIN ring, but it's time to chill..... We are near the Dunkathon.
[1:31:57] <%Theycallmenerf> I think if you invade and win via NPC it counts as a bone out/bonfire rest?
[1:31:57] <QuadraticGravity> Didn't read the fire keeper soul, no
[1:31:59] <%cubbywolf> why are you fucking with this giant?
[1:32:03] <jacobknight13> has reggie encountered O&S yet?
[1:32:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nope
[1:32:06] <oak120> no
[1:32:09] <%pennykettle_> Reggie is really strong, let him make subpar decisions
[1:32:09] <%Grimlockfly> why he goin back out here?
[1:32:09] <FuumetsuKuroi> Not yet
[1:32:11] <%Theycallmenerf> No

[1:32:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Grimlockfly Reggie does things differently lol
[1:32:24] <%cubbywolf> you couldnt be any safer if you where in my loving arms
[1:32:28] <Call_for_Adventure> Crush the firekeeper soul for some extra humanity
[1:32:28] <subjectg> To be fair, i only put on FAP when i reached 40 end, it‚Äôs not much of a problem if you‚Äôre good at the game
[1:32:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Jiggisnipe My point is just that there's a backup. Chill the fuck out
[1:32:32] <RickyRelucent> guys, don't be dissapointed if he doesn't go for quickrolls. Imagine the fun on artorias and manus
[1:32:37] <%holydeviant1> THIS is the SPICY SOUL
[1:32:38] <%Theycallmenerf> DONT USE FIREKEEPER SOUL
[1:32:39] <ronin19xx> I feel like hes going to one-shot O&S with Solarie getting the attention of one of them
[1:32:40] <Starmanhero> Reggie is at baller peak about to be dunked on by Biggie and Smalls
[1:32:41] <MeImoth> DO NOT USE THIS ONE

[1:32:51] <%thotbane> DO NOT USE THE FIREKEEPER SOUL
[1:32:52] <%holydeviant1> The diffference in the descirption is the warning label

[1:35:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> People need to not backseat as much with what they want. Giving information is helpful just keep it neutral instead of "should do this/that"

[1:36:21] <Estuko> problem is with people trying to help is some people played the game yesterday and the other group haven't played the game for several years, then you have youtube playthrough watchers. t's all really unreliable

[1:36:25] <RickyRelucent> 100% honest

[1:36:44] <%pennykettle_> You couldn't heal in the original game's invasion
[1:36:48] <%Lordgale119> so, odds that this is the set for the future? Asking for an artist.
[1:36:53] <+Vigonept> reggie just needs to brute force shit fuck statategy
[1:36:53] <velgaduere> Reggie has delicate planning, it's called the R.E.G.G.A.R.T.H. System
[1:36:56] <%Lordgale119> The artist is me.
[1:36:56] <slackerunchained> Fun Fact: The latest Cinders builds have turned Lautrec into an optional superboss. :P
[1:36:58] <%CaptainBeird> woolie and reggie you haven't checked all levels of the elevator just so you know

[1:50:36] <DSD24> I always kill Smough first Orstein is way cooler
[1:50:37] <@Solidus_113> thanks catchpole
[1:50:38] <BurdRightsActivist> THERE
[1:50:38] <available_line> Reginald Skill
[1:50:39] <R_Blaze> I MISSED THE 1ST ATTEMPT BibleThump
[1:50:39] <velgaduere> nice, prediction ended early
[1:50:40] <BurdRightsActivist> oh
[1:50:40] <%jonblnt> luck is a skill
[1:50:41] <velgaduere> love that
[1:50:41] <CthuluIsSpy> did he not find the bonfire that's not too far from the boss?
[1:50:43] <+beardy_foxbear> These doubter odds are too good to pass up
[1:50:44] <subjectg> Twinkling titanite weapons are really good, i beat O&S my first time with the silver knight spear
[1:50:45] <+kevlarkoala> @ronin19xx hes higher level than either were on their on stream playthroughs
[1:50:46] <+Reverend_Roscoe> that prediction is so short
[1:50:47] <+canseesea> incoming 40 hours spent on the bed of bullshit
[1:50:49] <Duskendawn> Sun bro yeah or nah?
[1:50:49] <pixel_river> and without suimoon assisteance impressive
[1:50:50] <%RemedyofRevenge> to be fair, most people dont have the right of kindling on their first playthrough at this point
[1:50:50] <+kevlarkoala> like a lot higher
[1:50:55] <%Prevot> damn voting over already
[1:50:55] <+eanscrale> At this point you should make him pop the dried finger in every zone
[1:50:56] <%holydeviant1> @ronin19xx Reggie has skill. Just had to hone it.
[1:50:56] <pixel_river> *summon
[1:50:56] <Lefteron> I see you have accuired the havel set.
[1:50:57] <%sewermonk> Manus and Kalameet might be rough
[1:50:59] <%jepupu> Getting this much estus is a big thing that helps. I didn't know what humanity did, so I was hoarding it on my first playthrough.
[1:51:00] <%debrv> @r_blaze HE WAS ROCKING IT.
[1:51:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Channel points bugged
[1:51:01] <zzNamttamzz> Bed of chaos tho LU
[1:51:01] <+spitelite> ok lets see if crazy talk activates
[1:51:01] <%hax_metatron> 20 sips
[1:51:02] <+robertoszek> yeah, some first timer don't have the rite of kindling going here
[1:51:02] <BurdRightsActivist> ):
[1:51:03] <+McSoliace> ok now im playing the odds but i was a believer
[1:51:03] <OfficerMods> Except maybe THAT one
[1:51:05] <DarknessHS> 20 sips in o&s
[1:51:05] <elshadow7> To be fair, I don't think a lot of people go in with 20 estus first time around
[1:51:07] <+Undenizen> do that again, but better.
[1:51:07] <a_mad_dragon_> FIGHT KNIGHT HAS RELEASED KomodoHype
[1:51:08] <ronin19xx> @ronin19xx Thats fair

[1:51:16] <oda_flobunaga> that one in The Tomb of giants
[1:51:17] <EVOriginal> I think the DLC bosses are going to give him some trouble.
[1:51:17] <%Theycallmenerf> NO SOLAIRE?
[1:51:20] <youngking_kush> There is ONE man who will definitely challenge him but he is DLC
[1:51:21] <urkleturtle> like 95% of players don't have 20 sips and a fully max'd weapon at this point, but yeah, still true
[1:51:23] <+pectusumbra> @a_mad_dragon_ For real?!
[1:51:23] <pepinillomaton> Most people dont have 20 sips or that catchpoll, anyway good job
[1:51:25] <velgaduere> Solairen't
[1:51:26] <R_Blaze> @debrv I can at least watch him win it
[1:51:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Well there is the DLC Woolz
[1:51:28] <%pennykettle_> fuck solaire
[1:51:29] <+beardy_foxbear> No Solaire

[1:51:30] <pixel_river> i beat this boss with coop i admit
[1:51:31] <%CaptainBeird> yeah you typically come in with 10 because you don't go into catacombs
[1:51:31] <%AbnormalVoid> the power of an endgame weapon and 20 Estus

[1:51:53] <%Rafraud> RUN IT BACK SOLO
[1:51:54] <%hax_metatron> CHONK VS FAST
[1:51:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Supercharged Smough
[1:51:58] <owensleftfoot> It's not nearly as cool tho
[1:51:58] <ALvl78Zapdos> you get a fatty armor set
[1:51:59] <$eco419> The first try is always the best shot the second part is where the overconfidence kills you
[1:51:59] <+askalta> I'm convinced Reggie could do it solo if he wanted to
[1:52:00] <%Dopamien> do bosses get larger health pools with summons on DS1?
[1:52:01] <zzNamttamzz> Super Smough PogChamp

[1:52:15] <PkSilent01> Did I miss the Fire Keeper Killer fight?
[1:52:17] <primaryfire> depends on what you want
[1:52:18] <FuumetsuKuroi> Super Ornstein
[1:52:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Smough's Hammer would be good for his build
[1:52:20] <PkSilent01> !uptime
[1:52:20] <%pennykettle_> super ornstein seems easier
[1:52:20] <@Moobot> @PkSilent01 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 57 minutes

[1:52:36] <PkSilent01> @dsd24 did he kill him?
[1:52:39] <+Jiggisnipe> I think he can do this without Solaire but he saw it solo so he knows now
[1:52:40] <%Theycallmenerf> SUPER ORN
[1:52:41] <RickyRelucent> smough's cutscene is kinda fucked up
[1:52:42] <%Lion_kun> I used Slough hammer
[1:52:42] <DSD24> @PkSilent01 Yes he did!
[1:52:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> This Fashionsouls is weird lol
[1:52:43] <Oculocto> Correct choice.

[1:55:09] <%X2Eliah> @dude_bruhh hes done demons
[1:55:10] <%hax_metatron> IT WAS BRUCE WILLIS THE WHOLE TIME‚Ä¶ He was the father of Luke
[1:55:11] <Estuko> @dude_bruhh he completed Demons Souls
[1:55:11] <%CodenameChaz> @dude_bruhh No he beat DeS
[1:55:11] <slackerunchained> 'Close' only counts in Horseshoes and thermonuclear warfare, Reg.
[1:55:12] <DSD24> @dude_bruhh He played Demon Souls earlier this year
[1:55:13] <srv4254> i think reggie would adapt to sekiro pretty fast
[1:55:14] <%Lion_kun> Reggie you keep jumping instead of rolling
[1:55:14] <Oculocto> @RyTYoung One shot crushed it.
[1:55:15] <DJ6S> Hey Reggie! Did you know that *spoils entire franchise*
[1:55:16] <%cubbywolf> demon soul remake was his 1st
[1:55:21] <%Euphbugg> keep doing good Reggie
[1:55:24] <%Lion_kun> You need to fix that habit
[1:55:28] <PraiseHemra> other bonfire is a faster route
[1:55:28] <+robertoszek> @dude_bruhh, did you know? he played De
[1:55:35] <%cubbywolf> Lets go demons! kill Reggie~!
[1:55:37] <+robertoszek> @dude_bruhh, did you know? he played DeS*
[1:55:37] <Johannen> He might just die to the Giants
[1:55:39] <%RyTYoung> @kosorsomesaykosm_ noo I missed it csbeastSetIn @oculocto
[1:55:39] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @WoolieVersus i love that reggie is wearing pieces of equipment that O & S would recognize, like silver knight armor, havel's hat, a titanite demon's spear, etc.
[1:55:41] <%funya_rinpa> Woolie told him about changing the jump input but I guess he wasn't interested
[1:55:43] <%X2Eliah> Reggie having protection from invasions is super unfair though
[1:55:43] <IzanagiNoOokami> Gwyn banished Havel to the basement cause he beat Gwyn in a Hotdog eating contest.
[1:55:49] <+mechslayer71> @kevlarkoala I dunno man, those attacks are still super slow and telegraphed
[1:55:50] <%cubbywolf> here'we'go demons here'we'go!
[1:55:52] <%X2Eliah> this area is NOT a clean walk up to thre door
[1:55:53] <primaryfire> luckily the sign is right in front of the door
[1:55:54] <Crownaux0> child mask plz
[1:55:55] <Estuko> Did Reggie get the rocket launcher to help with the Akuma boss fight
[1:56:03] <AncyentMarinere> Will the student surpass the master in DS2? LUL
[1:56:06] <Josef_Stryker> DEW IT
[1:56:07] <subjectg> child mask for baby
[1:56:09] <sendart> child mask is nice

[1:56:09] <velgaduere> the FAP ring is calling...
[1:56:12] <%debrv> .... What ya planning, Reg?
[1:56:12] <RickyRelucent> lighter helm = heavier others
[1:56:13] <Jontman42> you know the answer
[1:56:14] <+kevlarkoala> @mechslayer71 @mechslayer71 it's basically like coming to the 3rd gym in a pokemon game when you've already been to the 4th and 5th lol
[1:56:14] <Duskendawn> Protection from invasion is fine, for the sake of the LP
[1:56:15] <+jacqueblacqued> time to FAP
[1:56:17] <gespenstkick> Grass crest shielld
[1:56:18] <+Jiggisnipe> @mechslayer71 keep in mind, this was most people's 1st and some people's 2nd souls game so yea

[1:56:25] <%unboundsoul358> what if he just went and got grass crest tho
[1:56:28] <%Theycallmenerf> GRASS SHEILD

[1:56:34] <$eco419> Baby face Reggie
[1:56:35] <+mechslayer71> @jiggisnipe yeah, I started with bloodborne so LUL
[1:56:39] <elshadow7> Oh wow, no GCS yet huh?
[1:56:41] <%cubbywolf> who uses those?
[1:56:42] <velgaduere> @primaryfire didn't pick ti up
[1:56:42] <@Solidus_113> he doesn't have the grass shield
[1:56:45] <RickyRelucent> and the grass shield

[1:56:53] <+kevlarkoala> @mechslayer71 notice how he went from 20 sips to 8? imagine doing this without 20 sips and without the insane DPS he's putting out with his endgame weapon
[1:56:55] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> he hasnt been to basin

[1:57:02] <%hax_metatron> FAP ring LUL
[1:57:07] <+Jiggisnipe> @mechslayer71 lol you were already forged in the heat so DS1 looks so much easier

[1:58:37] <Duskendawn> LUL
[1:58:37] <Aussie_Manny> That last run was great.
[1:58:41] <DJ6S> Just don't get hit
[1:58:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nah, just RNG with the boss moves
[1:58:44] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Green Blossoms will give you more than enough extra stamina regen if you want it that badly.
[1:58:45] <AvroEltz> Just play it safer with second phase
[1:58:45] <velgaduere> Reggie is no longer baby. Reggie now wants POWER
[1:58:47] <FuumetsuKuroi> Just don't die TriHard
[1:58:47] <+TopTieramisu> it's time reggie. put on the yellow skirt
[1:58:49] <%CaptainBeird> now i'm not part of the FAP master race but it is more stamina
[1:58:49] <%cubbywolf> no, let reggie kill the stream!
[1:58:51] <Slim_Lipid> skill issue :)
[1:58:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's all about what kinda moves the boss does and sometimes they just don't do certain ones
[1:58:59] <Razeino> reggie needs to go more on the offense
[1:59:00] <%cubbywolf> I know i just walked away LUL
[1:59:00] <DSD24> Wow that stab from off screen
[1:59:02] <Duskendawn> Just draw reg as a naked hollow
[1:59:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggarth wants to split the universe with a single attack

[1:59:14] <CatRidder> grass up
[1:59:15] <%Rafraud> I mean lower damage though
[1:59:21] <Aussie_Manny> This monk staff is so strong.
[1:59:21] <%cubbywolf> its two steps from the boss, time to change everything
[1:59:25] <Johannen> Also Stamina Regen wont affect the amount of swings that you can do in a sequence
[1:59:25] <pepinillomaton> Hey, I think he is strong enough to allow invasions and make things spicy
[1:59:36] <%jinking79> i want Crazy Talk to happen somehow
[1:59:44] <RickyRelucent> @Johannen fap gives +30 sta tho
[1:59:53] <Aussie_Manny> I imagine the fat man is an easier 2nd phase fight.

[2:05:40] <velgaduere> @Crownaux0 he can do both
[2:05:43] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I doubt they would spend 3 hours on Monster Hunter Rise, that game is pretty fast

[3:01:18] <BigYanno> nobody learns this without being told
[3:01:20] <+anoldtoilet> no he cant roberto
[3:01:20] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora The description of this ring is quite possibly mistranslated. What was localized in English as "a loss of the annals" could very well have been intended to mean "was struck from the annals."
[3:01:20] <Xaeveax> @superc37 He said Souls franchise, not all of their games. Maria is still on the table.
[3:01:20] <Johannen> @superc37 Not a souls series technicly
[3:01:20] <atlasdotwav> He gets the best messages
[3:01:22] <%pennykettle_> the tomb of the fucking god king gwyn himself
[3:01:22] <legacy0117> The coolest guy.
[3:01:23] <RickyRelucent> its just headcannon
[3:01:23] <oak120> thats a very gaudy sword
[3:01:23] <%X2Eliah> need feet
[3:01:24] <derap41> Mausoleum*
[3:01:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> why would the guy who defies his literal god parent be Woolie's fa... ohhhhh
[3:01:29] <+anoldtoilet> reggie hasnt watched chat this entire playthrough
[3:01:32] <RickyRelucent> about as cannon as solaire being the one anyway
[3:01:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @anoldtoilet 100% wrong
[3:01:41] <rasamune> more like a loss of the anals hurr hurr
[3:01:42] <%notsoy> nor should he watch chat
[3:01:45] <%gitgouda> try it and find out
[3:01:46] <velgaduere> maybe read some rings
[3:01:46] <%Ensign_Epic> there's a decent possibility his name is Faraam, the only other war god we know of
[3:01:48] <BigYanno> TRY RING
[3:01:53] <RyuuAoi> @anoldtoilet He has
[3:01:56] <randomguy722> well considering Kratos has the ashes of his family attached to his skin, that would be thematically related
[3:02:01] <%pennykettle_> Hmmm üëÄ
[3:02:02] <CatRidder> not that one
[3:02:04] <goose_coward> oop
[3:02:06] <derap41> Can reggie solve the mystery
[3:02:06] <oak120> We dont talk about that guy
[3:02:08] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Japanese can be ambiguous that way, especially since the localization teams for these games are often actually not shown or told about the game they're translating, so they may have no context for what they're localizing
[3:02:09] <%pennykettle_> almost
[3:02:09] <slackerunchained> Gwyn: I *refuse* to recognize that ring...
[3:02:10] <drunken_lemur> No?
[3:02:11] <+anoldtoilet> there was like 5 minutes when woolie went to piss
[3:02:12] <BigYanno> maybe try a different ring
[3:02:14] <CatRidder> nop
[3:02:14] <+Bitscreed> On the right track though
[3:02:15] <Parapattern> So close
[3:02:17] <+anoldtoilet> but mostly not watching

[3:02:32] <%superc37> @ensign_epic eeeh but faraam doesnt rly fit with the naming scheme geyns family has
[3:02:33] <subjectg> @a_german_spy that‚Äôs how i thought about it, and it‚Äôs consistent with other descriptions about him, like on sunlight medal

[3:03:15] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg Yeah, and the Ring of the Sun's Firstborn's line about the "loss of the annals" is never corroborated anywhere else, so it's likely supposed to line up with them instead.

[3:17:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea we all knew lol
[3:17:32] <+Jiggisnipe> most people notice the warp option and check it
[3:17:34] <+NiktenKing> was much more entertaining
[3:17:34] <%atlasdotwav> atlasdotwav subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:17:40] <derap41> But it made Reggie strong
[3:17:40] <urkleturtle> but the 20 sips helped a lot with biggie and smalls

[3:19:50] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus did he forget about the warp lol
[3:19:51] <%pennykettle_> 99.99% of the lore Reggie is being read is uncaught by players. The game is EMPTY with lore, and it feels like a bad game. And then you see everyone online talking about insane lore
[3:19:51] <derap41> whoops

[3:20:22] <derap41> LUL
[3:20:23] <+GilroyGoldBlood> New firekeeper dialogue
[3:20:36] <El_Rabbit> Reggie is a chad LUL
[3:20:40] <RickyRelucent> @Johannen he'd miss out on it if he doesn't
[3:20:46] <DJ6S> Reggie is too busy thinking of fighting God and booba
[3:20:51] <%gulthrax> woolie is basically Solaire right now
[3:20:52] <slackerunchained> I really hope Reggie winds up replaying this on his own time

[3:21:32] <derap41> her eh
[3:21:35] <slackerunchained> Do NOT reinforce
[3:21:36] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent Wut, im talking about the one where you break Gwynewere

[3:21:50] <youngking_kush> Had to leave for sec but Reggie chose to simp for the Gods?
[3:21:51] <Parapattern> Nope, she wouldn't
[3:21:52] <%Rafraud> Wow reggie actually made the connection
[3:21:53] <%seydaq> woolieSHOOKREG
[3:21:56] <slackerunchained> Just *might* be a tad upset...
[3:21:57] <ShadowArcangel> Man, everyone cool is on the gods side though
[3:21:57] <cavefishes> reggie is super right
[3:21:59] <$eco419> LUL
[3:22:02] <velgaduere> @BurdRightsActivist bro do you want content or not lmao
[3:22:06] <+pectusumbra> seriously, just do firelink stuff first. This stuff isn't going anywhere
[3:22:06] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> odds are he‚Äôll have already placed the vessel before meeting kaathe, so thats a choice he might not get to make
[3:22:10] <peachy996> It will be okay if you don't blaspheme.
[3:22:12] <RickyRelucent> @Johannen It only gets dark after you murder gwynevere or go inside.
[3:22:12] <420mangojuice> 5Head
[3:22:13] <BurdRightsActivist> @velgaduere :)
[3:22:14] <%RemedyofRevenge> you can always go to the undead church and get your sins forgiven
[3:22:15] <%Demoli_PT> damn i didnt take reggie for a god BOOTLICKER
[3:22:18] <Parapattern> I can't believe Reggie intuited that
[3:22:20] <%gulthrax> Reggie's motherly intuition came through
[3:22:25] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I mean, you saw what happened to Firelink's bonfire when the other firekeeper died.
[3:22:25] <Razeino> Come on take out that lying bussy
[3:22:25] <+Grayhammatter> reggie LUL
[3:22:27] <+Silioth> i forgot, what happens when you reinforce here?
[3:22:29] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:22:31] <+Bitscreed> Why would she try to fight you Reggie?
[3:22:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if you kill her god she would probably know
[3:22:37] <%funya_rinpa> Woolie trying his best
[3:22:38] <%Demoli_PT> you lose firelink bonfire permanently
[3:22:39] <velgaduere> @BurdRightsActivist lobosPLS
[3:22:45] <peachy996> @Demoli_PT Gwyndolin doe. Also imagine him wearing boots
[3:22:46] <RickyRelucent> @A_German_spy well, he doesn't need that bonfire anymore does he
[3:22:47] <derap41> Reggie is Gonna Pull a Lautrec any minute now
[3:22:49] <%atlasdotwav> Why not reinforce?
[3:22:51] <%pennykettle_> Reggie should disturb Gwynevere before he goes through the fog IMO but it's not a huge deal
[3:22:53] <+Silioth> daaamn
[3:22:56] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> @silioth nothing special, its that he has the firelink keeper soul
[3:22:56] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent Yeah, but does that cutscene trigger with that fog gate? You would not get the Gwyndolin dialogue right?
[3:23:06] <oda_flobunaga> cn also eat it for souls
[3:23:09] <slackerunchained> @atlasdotwav ...Cause it *might* have an alternative use.
[3:23:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> A heard of a biiiiiiitch
[3:23:12] <PunkZedB> biiiiiiiitch
[3:23:13] <drunken_lemur> What type of research?
[3:23:13] <%RemedyofRevenge> its not a tale a giant would tell you
[3:23:14] <peachy996> I've heard of that bitch yes.
[3:23:14] <%A_German_spy> @RickyRelucent What, Firelink? I mean, technically you can play the game without ever using a bonfire. But that doesn't mean they're not useful.
[3:23:14] <+vaderxyz1970> I heard he was a Bitch...

[3:35:26] <youngking_kush> @haitakaa He was not.Smough was tho

[3:50:07] <RickyRelucent> it goes dark as soon as u enter gwyndolin's cubby
[3:50:08] <BigYanno> the implication is the empty chest had the set she wears
[3:50:09] <subjectg> I made a build just to use that
[3:50:09] <slackerunchained> @derap41 Ah.
[3:50:10] <derap41> Coolest spell for sure
[3:50:11] <jett_eyes> The chest is empty because the firekeeper already has the set
[3:50:19] <%atlasdotwav> Best spell besides spear
[3:50:22] <jett_eyes> i never realized dat
[3:50:22] <jackelzxaa> Hey Woolie, Dark Souls Remaster has a somewhat obscure option in the controls settings to rebind the Jump function of the Circle Button to L3 like DS2 and later games have.
[3:50:33] <subjectg> @atlasdotwav wrath tho
[3:50:35] <%Valask> @BigYanno nah man it's the pendant I tell you
[3:50:37] <%KBGuilty> DARKMOON KNIGHTESS
[3:50:38] <%pennykettle_> @jackelzxaa he brought it up to Reggie and Reggie preferred it like this
[3:50:40] <@Solidus_113> @jackelzxaa he knows
[3:50:40] <legacy0117> I remember this room from DS3. Very cool.

[3:50:55] <Parapattern> That makes it BETTER
[3:50:56] <+beardy_foxbear> Becoming a fire keeper fucks you up
[3:50:58] <LVL1_Scumbag> Gnawed by humanity
[3:51:03] <BigYanno> the armor is SICK!!
[3:51:03] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus she was undead, she was Jerky
[3:51:04] <peachy996> I dont even know if SHE'S hideous if Gwyndolin is described the same way
[3:51:09] <velgaduere> Reggie's reason for killing her will be due to uggoness
[3:51:11] <Duskendawn> She's gwyndo's tier 3 sub LUL
[3:51:14] <peachy996> I'm gonna say no
[3:51:17] <jackelzxaa> do the later games let you switch it back to circle?  I've left it on L3 for so long that i can't actually remember if BB and DS3 let you
[3:51:18] <%Valask> is there a reason she gets to keep her tongue
[3:51:20] <DJ6S> The armor stays on during sex
[3:51:21] <derap41> Gwynewere might be a lie but Gwyndolin sure isn't
[3:51:21] <+Jiggisnipe> the humanity under her chest would disturbing I imagine
[3:51:24] <+anoldtoilet> weird, unique gauntlet description
[3:51:28] <+vaderxyz1970> She had 1 birthmark on her face making her Hollywood Hiddios
[3:51:32] <zzNamttamzz> Favorite armor Kreygasm
[3:51:35] <peachy996> She has good taste
[3:51:39] <haitakaa> goldfish
[3:51:41] <Cherokia666> She has a type
[3:51:41] <cavefishes> the hideousness of firekeepers is usually attributed to all the humanity writhing and gnawing under their skin
[3:51:45] <+anoldtoilet> ah
[3:51:47] <%gulthrax> Squid4 fextraGasm Squid1
[3:51:48] <+anoldtoilet> its a cool one
[3:51:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Valask I don't think the tongue thing is for every firekeeper, just the one at firelink
[3:51:51] <RickyRelucent> They make a good fit,wish more relationships like that went like that
[3:51:51] <DJ6S> She want that God bussy
[3:51:52] <youngking_kush> "Tentacle-chaaaannnn"

[3:52:04] <Zeif00> C L E A N
[3:52:06] <+Bitscreed> I mixed and matched this one with Lautrec's for my Faith build.
[3:52:08] <%RemedyofRevenge> warp to firelink to get better lighting on that drip
[3:52:09] <%Deekman> isn't there another ring in here?
[3:52:11] <%Valask> I rocked this in PvP for years
[3:52:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that helmet is the BEST
[3:52:13] <%pennykettle_> I like Gwyndolin's chair to watch over his father's tomb
[3:52:14] <derap41> This with Favor set is cool too
[3:52:18] <Aussie_Manny> The back fin makes you more aerodynamic in a fight. Kappa
[3:52:21] <haitakaa> also check that miracle
[3:52:23] <jackelzxaa> reggie could mix and match between the 3 yellow armors
[3:52:24] <atomizedstream> it's the rtx on version  of the cutter enemy from kirby
[3:52:25] <$ArCielArDor> Gwyndolin let themselves go by the third game
[3:52:26] <+BananaSlammuh> @jackelzxaa three shot. 1st was good tho. Got it to just Ornstein

[3:52:37] <zhenthrim213> bought the farm
[3:52:41] <Scorchfield> eh, there is a better farm elsewhere
[3:52:43] <%funya_rinpa> Phalanx is way better
[3:52:44] <youngking_kush> There are greener pastures
[3:52:45] <%DegenCat> Reggie sold the farm for a little bussy.  Pathetic.
[3:52:47] <jackelzxaa> theres a few silver knights off to the side that stick around but that might be an oversight
[3:52:48] <%Prevot> they're simping for someone else
[3:52:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Subsidies dried up, the bank came and took the farm
[3:52:50] <slackerunchained> They're technically seperate.
[3:52:50] <vVAstrAVv> silver knights too
[3:52:51] <oak120> Not anymore they aint
[3:52:52] <subjectg> I can‚Äôt get over how the favor set and brass set have two different shades of yellow, can‚Äôt match that shit
[3:52:54] <gryffinp> Painting guardians, to each other "Huh, someone turned the lights off."

[3:53:06] <Duskendawn> Painted world inhabitants are just there surviving no?
[3:53:08] <OblivionSword1> silver knight
[3:53:10] <jackelzxaa> my favorite farm in DS1 is the phalanx in painted world.  if you have an AOE spell you can just pop the whole mob and run back to the bonfire to repop them over and over.
[3:53:13] <QueequegTheater> What I miss so far today

[3:57:19] <Born_2_Late> but why would they give souls for that tho?!
[3:57:19] <%gulthrax> Gwyndolin is a gnome illusionist
[3:57:23] <+NiktenKing> He can do whatever
[3:57:24] <blackpegaso> Leading people down the simp road
[3:57:27] <+pectusumbra> the moon is a mirror for the sun after all
[3:57:27] <%hax_metatron> Classic video game moment IMO
[3:57:32] <%pennykettle_> Im gonna keep it alive so I can convince a guy to actually bring it back to life
[3:57:35] <%WutangchickeN> Gwyn be dressed up as a barn animal looking in the bath houses like wutang6GASM wutang6GASM wutang6CHAMP wutang6CHAMP
[3:57:36] <QueequegTheater> @A_German_spy I always felt like he was more Odin, what with the constant bargains and deals to stave off the Age of Dark
[3:57:37] <derap41> Basement dweller NEET god even
[3:57:40] <dalmek> Gwyndolin's ran the theme park
[3:57:44] <jackelzxaa> flame god flann....tower of flame??
[3:57:46] <slackerunchained> Living vicariously through the image of his big-boobied Sister.
[3:57:47] <+xerotwo> SUNLIGHT YELLOW OVERDRIVE!!!!
[3:57:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Even the SUN
[3:57:54] <jett_eyes> Aldrich: "Allow me to introduce myself"
[3:58:01] <%waltzqueen> @derap41 does this not count as a job? he evn has employees
[3:58:01] <derap41> Got real souls
[3:58:02] <%funya_rinpa> Wasn't Smough legit
[3:58:03] <jackelzxaa> imagine if when you broke the illusion the gear you found in the level left your inventory
[3:58:03] <Lefteron> @xerotwo tototototototo
[3:58:03] <Parapattern> You got there souls though
[3:58:04] <%A_German_spy> @QueequegTheater I'm not sure he made bargains or deals so much as just brute-forced everything to keep the flame going.
[3:58:04] <%Valask> What do we think about Lautric and his goons
[3:58:06] <%DapperCadavr> @jett_eyes the best
[3:58:07] <peachy996> Would Chat consider killin him in this game an Illusion or do you subscribe to lame ass "time is convoluted" exscuse?
[3:58:09] <+pectusumbra> you get the soul item, I assume they stayed
[3:58:12] <derap41> @waltzqueen Hobby at best
[3:58:15] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus if you kill gwyndolin before gwynevere, the illusion remains until you kill her
[3:58:15] <velgaduere> I think it's fair to assume they were real
[3:58:17] <luftraumm1> isnt ornstein at nameless dude place?
[3:58:18] <BigYanno> smough may have been real, ornstein wasn't tho
[3:58:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You also get souls from the fake enemies too though
[3:58:24] <%A_German_spy> @QueequegTheater Lighting himself on fire certainly seems like a bruteforce approach to me.
[3:58:27] <+silentsipher> @valask try kicking
[3:58:27] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus given that they dropped unique souls I gotta think that was real
[3:58:28] <R_Blaze> we don't get conifirmation til ds3
[3:58:32] <%Lion_kun> So if you kill Gwyndolin before Biggie and Smalls, what happens?
[3:58:37] <%Valask> @silentsipher much less fun
[3:58:39] <%pennykettle_> The time is convoluted meme is only brought up to explain multiplayer. Consider it non cannon
[3:58:39] <%Bread_Assassin> Only Smough was real, I think
[3:58:48] <+Grayhammatter> the nameless one
[3:58:49] <+mechslayer71> the Chadliest diety
[3:58:50] <+FATDANtcm> if Gwyn was dead, who stripped the Oldest Son's status?
[3:58:51] <jett_eyes> Yee, Ornstein in this game is also an illusion
[3:58:53] <yukichocomilk> [REDACTED]
[3:58:53] <jackelzxaa> Remember the good ol days when we used to think ------- was the firstborn?
[3:58:58] <QueequegTheater> @A_German_spy It's arguably very similar to Odin hanging himself for Mimir's knowledge
[3:58:58] <DJ6S> The on who is not named
[3:59:00] <%DapperCadavr> Coffin flop staring lord gwyns massive coffin
[3:59:01] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun You lock yourself out of the Darkmoon Blades, but the city stays light. Twilight doesn't happen until Gwynevere dies
[3:59:01] <nintega010> yo these new ads that just pop up on the side is godlike.
[3:59:01] <%Valask> @pennykettle_ is it though? I think they do believe it
[3:59:03] <DJ6S> on*
[3:59:07] <%gitgouda> mmmm all these channel points though
[3:59:07] <RickyRelucent> you get ONE
[3:59:10] <Reveresao> @jett_eyes it was another daughter I think
[3:59:12] <%atlasdotwav> Does a specific DLC boss take more damage to sunlight blade?
[3:59:16] <RickyRelucent> the darkmoon version has 33, so does crystal sword
[3:59:17] <+Shishi1205> Solaire covenant for sun bros
[3:59:20] <%Valask> the darkmoon blade is teh strongest buff
[3:59:21] <slackerunchained> Immense magic buff.
[3:59:21] <Lefteron> @FATDANtcm perhaps he come back to pay respects
[3:59:23] <T_Sasquatch> @pennykettle_ but ... The solaire shit with fixing his fuckup happens
[3:59:25] <+mechslayer71> @fatdantcm he was stripped before gwyn died
[3:59:28] <urkleturtle> strongest buff in the game
[3:59:28] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @lion_kun the illusion only disappears after Gwendolyn disappears
[3:59:29] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus if you get souls from illusory silver knights and giants then who's to say o&s in anor londo were also illusions
[3:59:38] <subjectg> @a_german_spy you can fight gwyndolin with a light backdrop yeah?
[3:59:39] <+FanServ> it does magic damage but it's still faith based
[3:59:42] <YourOwnSun> Magic damage
[3:59:43] <+FanServ> darkmoon blade that is
[3:59:45] <luftraumm1> hey chat what's with the titanite demon staff?
[3:59:47] <LunarRemix> Both are faith but one is Lighting damage other is Magic
[3:59:53] <%SarcFa> darkmoon blade and sunlight blade are both faith based, darkmoon blade also scales with covenant devotion
[3:59:54] <+Malysitos> Woolie the Liar
[3:59:55] <jackelzxaa> you have to stay in the covenant to use the spell
[3:59:56] <QueequegTheater> @subjectg Yes, you need the Darkmoon ring to go there
[3:59:57] <RickyRelucent> But you CAN use it without cov
[3:59:58] <primaryfire> darkmoon blade is busted as hell
[3:59:58] <derap41> @luftraumm1 reggie got lucky
[3:59:58] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg Yeah, as long as you don't destroy the illusion of boobs first
[4:00:02] <%pennykettle_> @T_Sasquatch what does that have to do with time or space? You just unlocked a door
[4:00:02] <yeildingthought> @luftraumm1 scales well with int
[4:00:04] <jackelzxaa> its one of the only covenant gifts that requires it
[4:00:05] <%seydaq> @atlasdotwav i think no. they kinda forgot their own lore... again
[4:00:05] <%atlasdotwav> It's 501 damage that's what
[4:00:12] <%CodenameChaz> @luftraumm1 Whats with it is that it's been tearing through bosses left and right
[4:00:21] <Duskendawn> @luftraumm1 The real hero of the game Kappa
[4:00:21] <+beardy_foxbear> Cast now in the name of Gwyn, ye not guilty.
[4:00:23] <luftraumm1> ah but the moveset is pretty lame
[4:00:28] <%fetrigon> chest woolieGASM
[4:00:29] <+pectusumbra> @LunarRemix reggie got lucky on THE FIRST demon by andre and has used it for a good while now. It's split str/dex/int scaling and mixed damage has carried reggie for sure
[4:00:30] <%pennykettle_> Well Reggie doesn't know its fake...
[4:00:30] <%atlasdotwav> @seydaq Ahh thanks
[4:00:32] <youngking_kush> Good time to go see the Giant Blacksmith
[4:00:46] <gryffinp> The weird question is, if Gwyn was already gone, who banished the Firstborn?
[4:00:54] <slackerunchained> @youngking_kush Good time to bring that soul back to the Firelink Fire-Keeper.
[4:00:59] <%Valask> "NO THE PENDANT"
[4:01:00] <+Shishi1205> huh thats resonable
[4:01:03] <%patriotrenegade> @gryffinp ^ this
[4:01:08] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @gryffinp was banished before Gwyn left
[4:01:09] <jackelzxaa> i assumed firstborn was banished BEFORE gwyn left?
[4:01:10] <youngking_kush> @gryffinp Why assume that happened after he left?
[4:01:11] <xxshadowxx416> YOU CAN GO KILL HER
[4:01:11] <+Grayhammatter> time to go see the giant smith?
[4:01:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you... did it
[4:01:18] <BigYanno> the firstborn was Banished before gwyn left
[4:01:20] <+Shishi1205> @jackelzxaa I thought so too
[4:01:24] <dontleavemealone4toolong> FIRELINK
[4:01:26] <EVOriginal> YOU...did it.
[4:01:26] <+Grayhammatter> or... or

[4:01:41] <+mechslayer71> did someon3 seriously just ask the same obviously answered questions RIGHT after someone else got it answered?
[4:01:41] <+Grayhammatter> just gonna leave the knightess alone? LUL
[4:01:44] <Duskendawn> Might as well get the firekeeper soul? Won't be returning here right
[4:01:48] <%SarcFa> @gryffinp Think the timeline is gwyn's firstborn is banished, leaves the thing at the pre-built tomb, gwyn leaves
[4:01:49] <%waltzqueen> Patches URGH
[4:01:49] <+Bitscreed> "Patches? Urrrrgh!"

[4:03:49] <QueequegTheater> Siegmeyer is the real boy
[4:03:50] <haitakaa> revive da girl
[4:03:57] <Bedllama> So the implication is the Onion Bro made it past the Ledge of Death because he force pushed the knights off, right?
[4:03:57] <Jerp> emit force does a surprising amount of stamina damage if you're ever forced to block it

[4:14:44] <elshadow7> @WoolieVersus is Domhall here yet?
[4:14:55] <youngking_kush> We got REAL spells now bois
[4:14:55] <%Valask> this is Beatrice's spell too
[4:14:59] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> does.. woolie know what these sorceries are like to use? he ran sorc in ds2 waaaaaaay back
[4:15:03] <derap41> it tracks too
[4:15:11] <oak120> Casts fast, hits like a bulldozer
[4:15:15] <LunarRemix> This is THE shit
[4:15:16] <+Grayhammatter> he's got REAL spells
[4:15:19] <%funya_rinpa> I hope Woolie leans him toward Soul Mass but idk if he knows much about it
[4:15:20] <Reveresao> homing mass is best choice
[4:15:22] <%SarcFa> soul spear is fast
[4:15:22] <jackelzxaa> yeah but he didn't get past the halfway mark so he didnt see some of the GOOD ds2 spells
[4:15:22] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Ye ye have to equip that ring as well to make the statue disappear
[4:15:22] <dundore77> it also requires 36 int
[4:15:22] <YourOwnSun> Its fast
[4:15:22] <RickyRelucent> its even slower
[4:15:23] <Lefteron> awwoo
[4:15:25] <sendart> soul spear is fast
[4:15:26] <subjectg> You know, since reggie has int, he could use dark bead
[4:15:27] <RickyRelucent> but it will be better
[4:15:29] <+Shishi1205> is the secon best one maybe
[4:15:29] <vVAstrAVv> soul spears are FAST
[4:15:30] <derap41> betta
[4:15:30] <QueequegTheater> Soul spear way quicker
[4:15:30] <jackelzxaa> sorc in ds2 is real good
[4:15:31] <%CateHecate> only good things happen when you create an alternate approximation of the power of a gods, right? Kappa
[4:15:33] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Reggie will like Soulmass because of how it works
[4:15:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There is literally like 1 spell better than that one
[4:15:36] <%Valask> iirc soul spear is fast
[4:15:39] <+vaderxyz1970> It's a rocket launcher
[4:15:42] <Karhax> get a good catalyst and it's nuts
[4:15:43] <+pectusumbra> get homing soul mass at the least
[4:15:44] <elshadow7> Gotta love chat: "It's fast!" "It's even slower!" LUL
[4:15:44] <Lefteron> No. But crystal spear is
[4:15:45] <haitakaa> homing mass is really good
[4:15:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @elshadow7 the duality of chat
[4:15:55] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus it was the big one gwyndolin was shooting at him
[4:15:55] <+king_of_mystery2> That is the great chaos fireball equivalent, almost.
[4:15:56] <%seydaq> @subjectg or pursue darker options
[4:15:56] <urkleturtle> a lot of power but not a lot of casts
[4:15:58] <velgaduere> @elshadow7 it goes at a moderate pace!
[4:15:59] <jackelzxaa> spells will scale off of your int stat too so they could be stronger than chaos magic
[4:16:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> Magic missile
[4:16:09] <Duskendawn> Reminder that reg's pyro gloves can be upgraded further for more damage
[4:16:10] <+Shishi1205> Like menat kinda
[4:16:14] <jackelzxaa> whereas fire magic just scales off of your flame upgrade level
[4:16:19] <cavefishes> not enough int for soul spear yet either
[4:16:20] <youngking_kush> Homing Soulmass is cook when I dont know what is in a room
[4:16:23] <RickyRelucent> homing with PW might be big
[4:16:23] <haitakaa> get both
[4:16:25] <OblivionSword1> both are good
[4:16:28] <@Solidus_113> Pursuers gonna be so nice
[4:16:29] <zzNamttamzz> spear also pierces
[4:16:30] <derap41> Its a good spell to cast if you want to prepare for a fight
[4:16:31] <Dabrikishaw> Soul Spear is a MUST for ALL Sorc builds
[4:16:36] <subjectg> now‚Äôs you‚Äôre chance to be a [BIG SHOT]
[4:16:42] <%Valask> people also don't know how to dodge crystal spear for soul spear for some reason
[4:16:45] <thotacon_tv> cant wait for dark bead
[4:16:50] <%atlasdotwav> Homing souls and then use pyro while it is in effect
[4:16:51] <+pectusumbra> While reggie doesn't have spear int yet he's got enough int weapon options at this point that can go for it
[4:16:54] <%seydaq> shinku hadouken
[4:16:54] <jackelzxaa> the only thing i don't like about spells in ds1 is there's no catalyst that isn't a magic want.  DeS has beast talisman and DS2 has Blue Flame
[4:16:58] <urkleturtle> get to studying nerd
[4:16:59] <Reveresao> he has 27 now
[4:17:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> increase brain
[4:17:01] <%funya_rinpa> Yeah, tbh, Soul Mass is great just to tell you an enemy is coming up on your ass too
[4:17:04] <+Shishi1205> 40k is 40k
[4:17:04] <+robertoszek> get the homing and try it out
[4:17:05] <Reveresao> 24?
[4:17:06] <%holydeviant1> Soulmass is so handy, just pop it before the fight starts and forget
[4:17:08] <%Double_Tap_That> You got enough for the crest as well
[4:17:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Soul spear is BIG worth it
[4:17:16] <subjectg> @rickyrelucent sorry, what‚Äôs pw again? memory bad
[4:17:18] <RickyRelucent> later just by howmuch, the way its going you wont be 120 by the end of this. More like 80
[4:17:19] <yukichocomilk> fuck the crest
[4:17:20] <@Solidus_113> that's a lot of levels
[4:17:22] <+Shishi1205> fuck the crest
[4:17:23] <derap41> better buy it right away
[4:17:24] <%Prevot> does he even have enough INT
[4:17:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:17:29] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> DS2 and 3 had hybrid weapon/catalysts too
[4:17:31] <derap41> just incase Logan runs off
[4:17:32] <+BignanasTheGawd> fuck crest, get balls
[4:17:32] <RickyRelucent> @subjectg ppower within, my bad ^^
[4:17:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> actually he should consider buyingthat now that he can
[4:17:37] <jackelzxaa> reggie's been pumping int a bit
[4:17:38] <%SarcFa> @RickyRelucent Dude he's already level 70+
[4:17:46] <%TheOddJik> He's got some business with the Lordvessel
[4:17:48] <BigYanno> at this point 20k stops being such a big deal
[4:17:49] <%atlasdotwav> You're not a caster so passive DPS is always a good add
[4:17:50] <%Rafraud> talk to snek?
[4:17:51] <+robertoszek> get the homing and try it out, the crest can be acquired whenever
[4:17:52] <%Javaa01> There's like 4 different paths that you can take right now
[4:17:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> is it time for garden gaiden part 2? maybe
[4:17:55] <Reveresao> He can bypass the crest tho @woolieversus
[4:17:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> time for a little housekeeping?
[4:17:58] <RickyRelucent> @SarcFa Yes, and he just finished anor londo at that lvl
[4:17:59] <youngking_kush> Time for MLGS???
[4:18:00] <thotacon_tv> artorias gives you the best farm spot
[4:18:03] <subjectg> @rickyrelucent riiight, i forgot power within was a thing, prefer sunlight blade
[4:18:03] <Johannen> So, what's the plan with Caathe? Are we ignoring it and just doing normal stuff?
[4:18:03] <slackerunchained> You can warp pretty much anywhere you're even slightly curious about, Reg.
[4:18:05] <xxshadowxx416> YOU CAN GO KILL WOMEN
[4:18:06] <RickyRelucent> instead of entering at 80
[4:18:12] <zzNamttamzz> Logan is going to leave
[4:18:16] <+Shishi1205> you can one and done it
[4:18:20] <derap41> Reggie is powerrful enough to handle it
[4:18:28] <+Shishi1205> And with Reggiess level its super doable
[4:18:36] <+Jiggisnipe> the bone zone
[4:18:38] <RickyRelucent> @subjectg they stack
[4:18:38] <DeathByPoke7> the bone zone
[4:18:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Could do New Londo for other snek
[4:18:45] <%waltzqueen> @xxshadowxx416 he's not paige
[4:18:47] <%atlasdotwav> Need holy club
[4:18:49] <+Shishi1205> Darkroot garden
[4:18:50] <+Bitscreed> Reggie beat O&S so the rest of Lordran is basically his oyster now.
[4:18:51] <+Grayhammatter> left the knightess LUL
[4:18:52] <Reveresao> ash lake
[4:18:58] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> i usually only get artorias crest on ng+
[4:18:58] <+Shishi1205> Valley of the drakes
[4:18:59] <%SarcFa> @RickyRelucent He has about half the game left, and the DLC, he will have plenty more levels, 50-60 is average AL level
[4:19:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> when mush men?
[4:19:10] <jackelzxaa> one thing i started doing on my last run of DS1 was keeping one of each soul size in my pocket so i can internalize the values easier without having to look them up.  it means intentionally not using those souls until i'm done with the game but it also means i don't need to check the wiki while i play
[4:19:12] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Yeah, not until you place the vessel
[4:19:13] <LunarRemix> Talking is fine but putting *that* down is not
[4:19:21] <subjectg> @rickyrelucent i figured, but my build used the slots for wrath and emit force/dmb
[4:19:30] <RickyRelucent> He could get plenty of lvls, but will he need them
[4:19:41] <+robertoszek> it's a victory lap now, basically
[4:19:41] <RickyRelucent> he's here at sl 70 with arguably 27 lvls wasted in int
[4:19:42] <%funya_rinpa> Don't forget that Int requirement
[4:19:45] <RickyRelucent> or somewhere else
[4:19:50] <RickyRelucent> so he's really above average
[4:19:50] <jackelzxaa> he could farm for soul spear in painted world
[4:19:50] <+anoldtoilet> ricky chill
[4:19:51] <+Shishi1205> placing the lordvessel makes him move
[4:19:54] <jackelzxaa> using phalanx
[4:19:55] <+Jiggisnipe> 36 int is alot
[4:19:59] <%atlasdotwav> How would you know not to put *that* down if you were just playing normally NotLikeThis
[4:20:00] <gryffinp> ...doesn't logan only leave when you empty his sales?
[4:20:00] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Still need lots of stats to use it
[4:20:02] <+anoldtoilet> his weapon would be doing literally 200 less damage a hit with no investment in int
[4:20:09] <vVAstrAVv> the student sells any spells missed from logan
[4:20:10] <%megaman_sentinel> dat int cost
[4:20:11] <youngking_kush> @rickyrelucent If he goes for "the sword" all that INT will be worth it
[4:20:15] <%swesterly> Crest is best investment as forest is best farm
[4:20:15] <cavefishes> yeah he's 9 int away from soul spear still
[4:20:17] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> pupper content and kaathe vessel are also mutually exclusive, unless he gets handed a ring
[4:20:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> pop a few souls and just buy all his shit
[4:20:22] <+anoldtoilet> yes, and "that" sword is a Str/Int weapon
[4:20:23] <+Funkyfjord> don't you have to buy all of his spells in order for him to move?
[4:20:23] <agustorm123> He goes to college?
[4:20:25] <+anoldtoilet> so hes built for it
[4:20:27] <+pectusumbra> 9 int to soul spear is worth
[4:20:31] <RickyRelucent> @subjectg multiple att slots get expensive, 5 lvls at 21 or 24
[4:20:32] <LunarRemix> Valley of Drakes too
[4:20:34] <%pennykettle_> Valley of Drakes
[4:20:35] <+Shishi1205> Valley of the drakes @WoolieVersus
[4:20:36] <jackelzxaa> did reggie kill the hyrda yet
[4:20:36] <RickyRelucent> i get that
[4:20:36] <toulon_somberjade> Once you placce the Lordvessel in firelink Logan will head the the archives
[4:20:37] <DJ6S> Doesn
[4:20:41] <thotacon_tv> crest gives you kaathe
[4:20:42] <jackelzxaa> hydra would be an easy source of souls
[4:20:46] <cavefishes> @fruit_pie_the_magician reggie has been poppin consumable souls all game and doesn't really have any in inventory
[4:20:47] <%RemedyofRevenge> he has the souls for the crest of artorias as well
[4:20:50] <@Solidus_113> completely overleveled for Basin now LUL
[4:20:54] <jackelzxaa> hydra is 15k isn't it?
[4:21:00] <DJ6S> Doesn't he need 28 int for MLGS?
[4:21:17] <youngking_kush> He's at 27 INT rn I believe
[4:21:21] <jackelzxaa> it'd be based if Reggie gets MLGS
[4:21:26] <emptyantics> !uptime
[4:21:26] <agustorm123> Way to much leveling
[4:21:26] <@Moobot> @emptyantics WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 26 minutes
[4:21:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also mlgs is a massive pain in the ass to actually get
[4:21:29] <jackelzxaa> MLGS is always worth it
[4:21:34] <RickyRelucent> @youngking_kush its already worth it, he nearly oneshot beavis and butthead and didnt even use power within
[4:21:36] <haitakaa> reggie horse knight
[4:21:39] <+pectusumbra> @jackelzxaa his build naturally moves towards it
[4:21:42] <atomizedstream> valley of drake's and havel's tower
[4:21:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> fuck it go full int Reggie
[4:21:51] <Duskendawn> Mlgs isn't that hard to get just annoying
[4:22:03] <%atlasdotwav> If he one shots Hydra I will hollow out
[4:22:06] <Johannen> Im afraid he wont get the tail without some bullshit or spells cause Seath is fucky wacky
[4:22:09] <haitakaa> Also Ash Lake
[4:22:10] <jackelzxaa> anime souls: Quelaag Fury Sword in the main hand and Gold Tracer in the off hand
[4:22:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> !motivated
[4:22:10] <@Moobot> @abelincoln_catpuncher 2391 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:22:13] <%SarcFa> @RickyRelucent He started with 10 int, spent 17 levels on it, and it is helping his current weapon do as much damage as it does
[4:22:15] <+Vigonept> hydra aint hard he can do it
[4:22:20] <@Solidus_113> the rest of the Tomb of Giants, the great hollow
[4:22:20] <+Shishi1205> @atlasdotwav one shot is almost impossible
[4:22:22] <Reveresao> those guys are one and done
[4:22:28] <%megaman_sentinel> yo chat did he get the grass crest sheild
[4:22:33] <@Solidus_113> no
[4:22:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> double fake wall
[4:22:48] <jackelzxaa> reggie has 5-ish zones available now
[4:22:48] <dizimous> I actually completely missed the great Hollow lmao
[4:22:48] <RickyRelucent> @SarcFa so he actually completed anor at sl 53
[4:22:50] <RickyRelucent> neato
[4:22:52] <%seydaq> reggie is a big boi too.
[4:22:52] <yukichocomilk> he has like half the game still to go LUL
[4:22:53] <+Shishi1205> there you go
[4:22:57] <%atlasdotwav> No??? Oh he's gonna love it
[4:23:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Yes the Meth head ghosts
[4:23:06] <+Undenizen> Great Hollow is a good choice because it's a dead end.
[4:23:06] <+anoldtoilet> ricky why are you not internalizing that hes using an int scaling weapon
[4:23:08] <@Solidus_113> CONTENT
[4:23:09] <jackelzxaa> 6 technically but you can't finish new londo until you beat another
[4:23:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you're about halfway
[4:23:14] <+anoldtoilet> and hes only doing this much damage because of int investment
[4:23:15] <RickyRelucent> Because split dmg
[4:23:16] <+Shishi1205> dlc too soonish
[4:23:19] <youngking_kush> I'm only recommending the sword cuz it's basically a direct upgrade to his current weapon yeah?
[4:23:22] <RickyRelucent> and its 27 int, pffrrtt
[4:23:26] <+Bitscreed> Reggie's reached a real turning point in the game. This is a good point to take a break.
[4:23:30] <QueequegTheater> It's all downhill from here boys
[4:23:33] <RickyRelucent> whats the scaling again on the ppole
[4:23:44] <jackelzxaa> has reggie made a lord vessel decision yet
[4:23:52] <+Bitscreed> @jackelzxaa Not yet.
[4:23:52] <haitakaa> beware frampton
[4:23:54] <%Valask> the bell keeps ringing, it makes me so happy
[4:23:55] <+vaderxyz1970> Then there's a DLC
[4:23:56] <%SarcFa> @RickyRelucent Literally not wasted levels, but hey keep saying his build sucks when he three attempting fucking O&S on a first playthrough
[4:23:57] <elshadow7> THey're still in this menu?!
[4:24:02] <jackelzxaa> the dlc isn't available yet
[4:24:06] <QueequegTheater> @RickyRelucent Medium Int, low Str. Don't remember the specific numbers
[4:24:06] <jackelzxaa> you need to do the bullshit first
[4:24:06] <RickyRelucent> never said it sucks.
[4:24:09] <+vaderxyz1970> Yet
[4:24:10] <nxflre> @jackelzxaa nope they making a filler episode for thee anime lol
[4:24:11] <RickyRelucent> it literally doesn't even matter
[4:24:12] <Duskendawn> Great hollow also makes for a fun watch for reg to react to
[4:24:13] <jackelzxaa> the extreme bullshit
[4:24:15] <+anoldtoilet> B int iirc
[4:24:16] <haitakaa> yea dlc before sif
[4:24:20] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> no dlc until he places vessel
[4:24:20] <@Solidus_113> The way I usually go is Tomb > Archive > DLC > Londo > Lava
[4:24:29] <+Shishi1205> as soon as he does logan dips
[4:24:37] <+Shishi1205> )I think=
[4:24:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:24:40] <%Valask> SHAN'T
[4:24:40] <Deko_> theres your warning
[4:24:40] <agustorm123> Go full int bro you want to do it
[4:24:42] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> vessel placed, or pupper bonding.. not both
[4:24:44] <jackelzxaa> dlc before sif is kind of too much because you're doing the hardest bosses in the game early which trivializes everything else
[4:24:44] <+anoldtoilet> but yes reggie is doing a pretty pure str/int build with vit/end and heavy armor, its absolutely not spread out or "every stat" like ricky keeps trolling about
[4:24:46] <derap41> Shalen't
[4:24:51] <+anoldtoilet> or wasted or w/e
[4:24:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Big Hat Seal of Approval
[4:24:57] <yukichocomilk> awww get soulmass
[4:24:58] <elshadow7> And it's super worth
[4:25:01] <DeathByPoke7> trusty patches
[4:25:03] <subjectg> I do catacombs and tomb before lordvessel just to grab wrath early
[4:25:04] <jackelzxaa> fuck yeah domhal
[4:25:06] <jackelzxaa> there he be
[4:25:06] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Chat yall smell bad
[4:25:06] <SheefEatsBeef> aye siwmae!
[4:25:08] <%atlasdotwav> Clip into him to show respect
[4:25:09] <elshadow7> Let's get some fashion going
[4:25:12] <LunarRemix> Should've gotten Soul mass
[4:25:12] <%Valask> did they get laurentius to hollow
[4:25:18] <RickyRelucent> He could've went lower on str and dex, and pumped just int
[4:25:21] <youngking_kush> Aye Siwmae!
[4:25:27] <youngking_kush> This my guy lol
[4:25:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DeathByPoke7 patches is post nito
[4:25:37] <elshadow7> Nice kick
[4:25:38] <jackelzxaa> reggie's gonna like power stance i bet when he gets there
[4:25:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah yes, time to spend those souls for perhaps a better cause, the endgame some might say
[4:25:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:25:39] <RickyRelucent> But he already found the pole as early as he could
[4:25:40] <QueequegTheater> UGHHH
[4:25:41] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent Yeah, he was pumping STR for the longest while for no reason
[4:25:42] <derap41> puny mortals
[4:25:42] <StebTheVee> weak
[4:25:44] <Zebroneath> lil tickles
[4:25:47] <derap41> I AM A GOD
[4:25:50] <+vaderxyz1970> BOOO
[4:25:54] <+anoldtoilet> holy shit
[4:25:54] <jackelzxaa> it ALWAYS feels baed
[4:25:55] <%counterfeitgimmicks> You dont have to jump???
[4:25:55] <%Deekman> NO FUCKING WAY.
[4:25:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Do it right
[4:25:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Oh, while you're here, check out the stats on the Crystal Shield. If you're not doing any parrying, it's the best all-around medium shield in the game. Might appeal.
[4:25:58] <+anoldtoilet> i didnt know you could do that
[4:25:58] <jackelzxaa> to make that jump
[4:26:00] <RickyRelucent> @Johannen That'd be on me, i wanted a quality build shrug
[4:26:01] <%seydaq> if only goombas had shields
[4:26:01] <Duskendawn> Does your little kick ever scale up in damage? I don't remember
[4:26:02] <%Valask> I mean the fall is more dangerous
[4:26:04] <RickyRelucent> with clay
[4:26:04] <%mr_sups> Aye Simwae
[4:26:05] <Jickiechan> I legit didn't know that
[4:26:08] <DedlokPM> rooD
[4:26:11] <+Jiggisnipe> idk both seem dangerous
[4:26:12] <+Bitscreed> Huh, I didn't know that
[4:26:16] <%Cozy90> GOLEM ARMOR :D
[4:26:16] <jackelzxaa> crystal shield is a great larger shield yeah

[4:29:11] <PunkZedB> Domnhall commited a devious lick
[4:29:11] <%Valask> You don't get the red hair!!
[4:29:12] <youngking_kush> Domnhall is that guy from Bayonetta
[4:29:13] <GHouseduivel> You'd have to be LION Kappa
[4:29:19] <%Valask> it's a CRIME

[4:29:52] <RickyRelucent> @elshadow7 he killed a boar, and now he killed a lion
[4:30:01] <derap41> He's got Faith in science
[4:30:07] <%pennykettle_> I wonder if the firstborn was Sun powers and Lastborn was Moon powers because you know, sunset
[4:30:17] <PunkZedB> you too can be a femboy
[4:30:29] <RickyRelucent> WidePeepoSad
[4:30:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> they aren't tentacles they're snakes

[4:30:47] <%Valask> Muh souls
[4:30:47] <+Bitscreed> Big money, fabulous prizes.

[4:30:49] <+BignanasTheGawd> the lord of shmoney
[4:30:49] <%atlasdotwav> WORTH IT
[4:30:52] <+pectusumbra> and unlike logan he ain't going anywhere
[4:30:56] <%Cozy90> said no one ever
[4:30:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> tentacles with heads
[4:30:59] <iinsectaa> Literally like a boss
[4:31:00] <youngking_kush> WELL worth it
[4:31:01] <+Grayhammatter> now's your chance to be a [[BIG SHOT]]
[4:31:04] <RickyRelucent> should''ve have moneyproblems byy now, unless you plan on wielding all those bossweapons
[4:31:10] <RickyRelucent> shouldn't*
[4:31:20] <LunarRemix> 250 isn't low
[4:31:23] <%Valask> the crystal stuff is good, but breaks all the fucking time
[4:31:26] <DJ6S> I can't believe God liked tentacles so much he made snakes irl
[4:31:27] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> ive worn the moon crown a few times on both fai and int builds
[4:31:31] <subjectg> you can‚Äôt parry with it though
[4:31:32] <derap41> 60 stability
[4:31:33] <%Valask> and can't be fixed iirc
[4:31:34] <rosemon5001> the runway arc starts now LUL @WoolieVersus
[4:31:37] <@Solidus_113> can't be repaired
[4:31:41] <+anoldtoilet> uhhh stability isnt though
[4:31:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1465556863949357058?t=vTY0O4ob-x0PxHn39K9_yQ&s=19
[4:31:43] <+pectusumbra> you can't repair them is the thing
[4:31:44] <%SarcFa> stability is a tad low, but it blocks damage
[4:31:45] <+anoldtoilet> and thats pretty important
[4:31:46] <SethYuikora> Just turn Reggie into a havel monster already
[4:31:52] <%A_German_spy> You just buy another
[4:31:58] <derap41> but who cares its cheap
[4:31:58] <+anoldtoilet> stability arguably the most important shield stat
[4:31:59] <Razeino> CAn repair it each time you reinforce it though
[4:32:01] <JdotSweapA> it LASTS though
[4:32:01] <QueequegTheater> neva eva
[4:32:03] <+Jiggisnipe> BoTW Kappa
[4:32:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> Disposable Shield
[4:32:03] <SheefEatsBeef> its like a toaster
[4:32:09] <yukichocomilk> the iphone shield
[4:32:12] <QueequegTheater> Fucken iPhone shields man
[4:32:16] <DJ6S> BOTW simulator
[4:32:18] <Pie_Mastyr> yeah just buy a few, and upgrading them will  fix durability :D
[4:32:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> don't flush it down the toilet even though it says you can
[4:32:26] <%atlasdotwav> Landrover shield
[4:32:26] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> magic shield would fix the stability
[4:32:33] <JdotSweapA> sadly it doesnt parry
[4:32:36] <%Valask> @Pie_Mastyr oh I had no idea
[4:32:37] <RickyRelucent> theres like one or two enemies
[4:32:38] <DJ6S> My sword breaks in 20 hits
[4:32:40] <RickyRelucent> who can drop that stuff
[4:32:57] <drunken_lemur> Easy Leo?
[4:33:03] <derap41> He might see something then
[4:33:10] <RickyRelucent> tfw reg will never find shiva in blight town
[4:33:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @drunken_lemur yea i hear it
[4:33:15] <%Valask> monkaS

[4:33:33] <%pennykettle_> Was Patches back
[4:33:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> 2 for 2 on succesfully jumping that not bad
[4:33:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> patches will not be here yet
[4:33:53] <%Valask> oh my god I forgot this guy existed
[4:33:56] <%Prevot> did haircut do the deed already?
[4:33:58] <teddygrahams82> I-no isn't a command
[4:33:58] <blue_grave> I wonder if there will be precarious jumps in elden ring
[4:33:58] <RickyRelucent> murderrrr
[4:33:58] <yeildingthought> That jump is so unnecessarily tense LUL
[4:34:03] <%atlasdotwav> He's good at this for a first playthrough. I guess demons helped
[4:34:03] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> oh.. did petrus..?
[4:34:04] <RickyRelucent> murderrrr hiiiimmm
[4:34:04] <agustorm123> We should see squeletons by now
[4:34:09] <Duskendawn> Haircut still the worst
[4:34:09] <derap41> Just lose it ahahahah

[4:34:35] <+pectusumbra> where does crestfallen go anyway? I don't remember
[4:34:35] <subjectg> @pennykettle_ it‚Äôs after beating a couple of bosses after saving them
[4:34:39] <jackelzxaa> getting all of the good endings is kind of a pain tbh
[4:34:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Reggie IS the miracle
[4:34:42] <yeildingthought> LUL
[4:34:45] <youngking_kush> @blue_grave I'm 1000% expecting a platforming section involving invisible platforms in Elden Ring

[4:34:56] <+pectusumbra> thanks chat
[4:34:58] <%Prevot> I feel like reggie might have killed enough bosses for haircut to have done it
[4:34:58] <%pennykettle_> Maybe he was thinking of the thing behind the titanite demon in anor londo
[4:35:04] <derap41> That statue is a dropped plot point

[4:39:37] <Karhax> you can still warp
[4:39:37] <%TheOddJik> HE IS TALKING ABOUT PHYSICALLY LEAVING
[4:39:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it doesn't lock you into this AREA chat

[4:39:40] <+Chimeraelite> you can warp out
[4:39:41] <%hax_metatron> PLEASE CONFIRM THAT
[4:39:41] <+anoldtoilet> @WoolieVersus it locks you into frampt though
[4:39:41] <subjectg> Thinking of a different thing
[4:39:42] <jackelzxaa> if he puts it down he can't get the other path
[4:39:42] <atomizedstream> it locks you into a certain path
[4:39:42] <+Jiggisnipe> chat you guys are talking about different things
[4:39:43] <agustorm123> KomodoHype
[4:39:44] <+Shishi1205> very wrong
[4:39:47] <+Ultimate_Edge> He has to place it so the golden fog walls go away chat
[4:39:48] <Lefteron> The warping power stays
[4:39:49] <+Shishi1205> chat
[4:39:50] <%Rasheedt> L chat
[4:39:50] <%hax_metatron> NOOO DONT PLACE IT
[4:39:50] <Treasure_Vault> This is getting confusing for all of us.
[4:39:51] <GHouseduivel> vineJape
[4:39:52] <rasamune> Okay that's what he meant my b
[4:39:52] <%pennykettle_> Chat, Reggie thinks he is being locked into a final zone or something
[4:39:53] <velgaduere> Spy where you at
[4:39:53] <+Bitscreed> Jees chat it doesn't lock you out of any endings.
[4:39:55] <PunkZedB> placing it locks you out of dialogue
[4:39:55] <PkSilent01> Get Spy to confirm
[4:39:55] <%atlasdotwav> Attn gamers kingseeker Frampt needs YOUR help and credit card information
[4:39:57] <PraiseHemra> yes it does
[4:40:01] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie thinks he's locked into a zone
[4:40:02] <jackelzxaa> you can talk to frampt now
[4:40:07] <%Ensign_Epic> he places the lordvessel now he's locked into Frampt
[4:40:07] <%SarcFa> @Ultimate_Edge One of the lord souls doesn't have a golden fog blocking it
[4:40:08] <teddygrahams82> monika did it all
[4:40:09] <jackelzxaa> and not ruin the paths
[4:40:10] <DedlokPM> It does not lock him down here. It locks him into a story route, but he can still leave here
[4:40:15] <RickyRelucent> Hes not locked into anyything
[4:40:16] <RickyRelucent> yet.
[4:40:16] <+anoldtoilet> this is specifically a PLOT choice yes
[4:40:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Woah, you can no longer meet Kaathe
[4:40:26] <%SarcFa> @Ultimate_Edge and can let him place it for the other choice for the gold fogs
[4:40:27] <cavefishes> you are locked in to PLOT not gameplay
[4:40:28] <teddygrahams82> monika was the 1st sinner
[4:40:30] <RickyRelucent> it literally doesn't even matter for the ending
[4:40:33] <yukichocomilk> there's nothing in the game telling you not to place it, that would be a ng+ decision or a spoiler
[4:40:34] <DensityD> SabaPing SabaPing SabaPing
[4:40:36] <RickyRelucent> the choice is made at the end of the last fight
[4:40:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hmm
[4:40:39] <%CateHecate> I WONDER

[4:40:43] <jumpyhugs> the CHOICE still exists, but Kaathe won't talk to you
[4:40:43] <+Ultimate_Edge> @SarcFa Oh. I see
[4:40:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> There is SO much reason for pause
[4:40:45] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent Context is important for the ending

[4:41:03] <+Jiggisnipe> @yukichocomilk yea, these games expect you play it multiple times and talk with each other
[4:41:04] <%atlasdotwav> HuRrY
[4:41:04] <%Valask> @RickyRelucent it's more about meeting the other guy

[4:41:33] <Karhax> just link it you nerd
[4:41:33] <%Dopamien> hes chat
[4:41:34] <+xyxlzyzm> pretty sure you're already locked out of kaathe just from coming down
[4:41:36] <yukichocomilk> @Jiggisnipe it's a little ridiculous to propose this choice to reggie when there's NOTHING telling him it's a choice LUL
[4:41:37] <velgaduere> don't let him rush you, bone instead
[4:41:39] <thotacon_tv> REGGARTH THE DARK LORD
[4:41:41] <jackelzxaa> yes you can bone out and place it later
[4:41:42] <%BisoromiBear> woolieONEGUY only knows the game from other streams they didn't pay attention to
[4:41:43] <+zepherl> can you still fast travel if you put it down?
[4:41:44] <DensityD> "I don't like that"
[4:41:44] <SethYuikora> Reggie does what he wants WHEN he wants
[4:41:48] <subjectg> @xyxlzyzm absolutely not
[4:41:49] <+pectusumbra> bone out. His nasty snake ass ain't going anywhere
[4:41:53] <%pennykettle_> It's been 1000 years and he finally has a candidate, he doesn't want to lose you
[4:41:54] <+Bitscreed> Reggarth goes his own way.
[4:41:55] <CoffeeSlice> NOW!
[4:41:56] <%ronin19xx> Frampt is a cryprobro
[4:41:56] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent Woolie already put him on this Dark Path, but missing Kaathe would be kinda bad if you want full context from the game and not just Woolie's mouth
[4:41:57] <Born_2_Late> i feel like this is confusing af
[4:41:59] <SixthShinx> Or what's left of anor lando LUL
[4:42:00] <%Valask> god his chewing
[4:42:02] <%atlasdotwav> Congratulations you are the 1,000,000th visitor to the lordevessel!! You win free iPod!1!!!
[4:42:02] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy aren't you already locked out of talking to Karth if you talk to Frampt first?
[4:42:06] <cavefishes> yo just link da flame bro trust me
[4:42:10] <teddygrahams82> he was waiting along time. that's why he's rushing you
[4:42:14] <%Ensign_Epic> no guys, the flag is placement
[4:42:15] <Iza_kku> nope
[4:42:17] <agustorm123> Trust me bro
[4:42:18] <kulmoth> @Deekman no
[4:42:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Deekman only locked once placing it
[4:42:20] <velgaduere> pretty sure Spy's not here right now
[4:42:22] <rasamune> @Jiggisnipe It's fine to make him aware that there is a choice, for the sake of content. He probably won't play this game again, at least not live
[4:42:22] <%notsoy> YOUR HUMANITY WILL BE SAFE IN THE BLOCKCHAIN
[4:42:25] <%jinking79> is mods gonna have to set emote mode soon LUL
[4:42:25] <GHouseduivel> Can't trus a only molar having mother fucking
[4:42:28] <RickyRelucent> @Johannen It'd be kinda funny, being a desecrating shit and burn anyway or be a shit for noithing
[4:42:28] <GHouseduivel> snake
[4:42:29] <DensityD> trigger the end times
[4:42:33] <%Prevot> so we just told reggie to go kill giant tits even though he didn't pick up on her being fake, but THIS people have issues with?
[4:42:34] <@Solidus_113> placing the vessel is what removes kaathe
[4:42:38] <subjectg> What‚Äôs wrong [worm]? TAKE THE DEAL
[4:42:38] <+anoldtoilet> yeah ive played this game before, placing it makes the other serpent mad
[4:42:39] <jorniev> doesnt this give you fast travel?
[4:42:43] <EpitaphTransmits> YEAH!!!!
[4:42:45] <Johannen> phew, crysis averted
[4:42:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man the difference between a somewhat guided first playthrough and a completely blind one is pretty astonishing, as in, you are almost playing a different game in a way
[4:42:47] <Iza_kku> ye ye ye
[4:42:49] <Zebroneath> choice to be made later
[4:42:52] <+Jiggisnipe> @rasamune yea of course, Woolie doesn't want block out certain content that he thinks his cool
[4:42:52] <DensityD> good lore good lore
[4:42:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> literally no harm in waiting to make the choice
[4:42:54] <sendart> finding kaathe is a bitch
[4:42:59] <DensityD> just cheat
[4:43:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Prevot i don't think people are mad about that, they just want him to go to non blocked areas
[4:43:01] <%Ensign_Epic> yesssssss
[4:43:02] <%counterfeitgimmicks> @Prevot He knew she was fake, the ring told him
[4:43:03] <teddygrahams82> like a relationship
[4:43:04] <%SarcFa> @jorniev You get fast travel as soon as you get the lord vessel, hs has it already
[4:43:05] <yeildingthought> ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt I keep it, It‚Äôs such a simple thing, mine‚Ä¶ my, precious‚Ä¶‚Äù LUL
[4:43:05] <EpitaphTransmits> The TRue Ending cometh!!!
[4:43:05] <agustorm123> Do whatever you want
[4:43:08] <SethYuikora> I would do what's obvious the first playthru
[4:43:09] <%Valask> I also had no idea Kaathe existed for like two playthroughs
[4:43:10] <RickyRelucent> Can't even find kaathe if u dont have the vessal
[4:43:12] <%Deekman> fuck yeah
[4:43:16] <RickyRelucent> he doesn't appear before u have it
[4:43:17] <gryffinp> too late
[4:43:17] <Tempmael> maximum lore
[4:43:21] <Josef_Stryker> No he won't
[4:43:22] <jackelzxaa> you can't do Kaeth AND the secret sif cutscene on the same run
[4:43:23] <CatRidder> bone out
[4:43:24] <%TheOddJik> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ But with the advantage of actually understanding the lore as opposed to getting to the end of a playthrough and NEEDING to watch lore videos to understand things.
[4:43:27] <%Klefth> He'll be pissed
[4:43:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> kaathe is a bitch anyway
[4:43:28] <%pennykettle_> I think the alt storyline doesnt hit hard if you dont play the game blindly first
[4:43:28] <jackelzxaa> cuz they're mutually exclusive requirements
[4:43:29] <Johannen> @RickyRelucent If that true?
[4:43:31] <%Klefth> You forry sool
[4:43:33] <%Prevot> @counterfeitgimmicks he needed to have woolie basically spell it out
[4:43:33] <%atlasdotwav> Succ
[4:43:33] <Born_2_Late> oh the flame is no longer kindled
[4:43:34] <%Cozy90> SUCC

[4:44:00] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman That's how I remember it, but lately my aging brain seems to be fabricating memories of things that never actually happened
[4:44:05] <subjectg> You can postpone the choice for a very long time
[4:44:06] <jackelzxaa> if you buy all of laurentous's pyromancies you can send him to the swamp with no worries
[4:44:10] <@Solidus_113> he be snoozing

[4:47:50] <iamtheTwitchghost> besides the acting

[4:48:02] <%pennykettle_> If you kill him he drops her talisman @iamtheTwitchghost
[4:48:03] <%Klefth> Patches tells you he's a PoS @iamtheTwitchghost
[4:48:05] <RickyRelucent> @Klefth trusty patches
[4:48:06] <derap41> Patches snitches
[4:48:07] <%seydaq> aint my mlady
[4:48:10] <DensityD> invade the boy
[4:48:10] <Lefteron> @iamtheTwitchghost i think patchs drops some hints
[4:48:12] <Treasure_Vault> Did Reggie talk to Pyro Larry?
[4:48:12] <%holydeviant1> @iamtheTwitchghost His stuff in chests + CRACKED RED EYE ORB
[4:48:13] <%Klefth> Yes
[4:48:14] <subjectg> @iamthetwitchghost lautrec has a tip for you earlier as well, oswald tells you he‚Äôs sus
[4:48:14] <+Jiggisnipe> Yes
[4:48:15] <jackelzxaa> lautrec tells you about him
[4:48:15] <%unboundsoul358> @unboundsoul358 True, just eager for petrus to get what's coming
[4:48:15] <Johannen> yes
[4:48:16] <RickyRelucent> the kind to stab you from the front
[4:48:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yup
[4:48:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> about stuff yeah
[4:48:17] <%Valask> I think he does
[4:48:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes, everyone relax
[4:48:18] <%Dopamien> ü§∑
[4:48:18] <DensityD> Big Yes
[4:48:19] <derap41> yes later
[4:48:19] <%CaptainBeird> yes
[4:48:19] <jorniev> yes
[4:48:20] <Zebroneath> Only when he's in Firelink
[4:48:20] <%Javaa01> Yes, yes he does
[4:48:20] <JdotSweapA> he does
[4:48:21] <+NeonFishFace> yes
[4:48:21] <+Bitscreed> Patches is a narc
[4:48:21] <+warlockwithapixie> Yeah
[4:48:21] <KingOfTheGeats> yea
[4:48:21] <+anoldtoilet> theres a reason Patches hates clerics dude.
[4:48:22] <Josef_Stryker> Lautrec also had something to say but you missed it
[4:48:22] <KaiserMario> Lautrec too
[4:48:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> i dunno lol
[4:48:23] <%Dopamien> idk lol
[4:48:26] <RickyRelucent> He has tons to say about everyyone
[4:48:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus He does, but you have to finish the Tomb of the Giants first.
[4:48:30] <+Zxander93> @iamtheTwitchghost He drops Ivory talisman when he dies. Also if you pay Lautrec he basically admits it.
[4:48:30] <JdotSweapA> Patches knows things~
[4:48:30] <RickyRelucent> trick is keeping them there
[4:48:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> after tomb of the Giants
[4:48:31] <%SarcFa> Also I think Lautrec can say something if you trigger this super earli
[4:48:32] <funnyfunnykid> Wait Patches is also in this one?
[4:48:35] <RickyRelucent> for him to talk shit about
[4:48:35] <Zebroneath> Converstaion for later
[4:48:38] <agustorm123> Patches knows
[4:48:38] <DensityD> universe means well, but we are actually emotional idiots
[4:48:38] <%SarcFa> *early
[4:48:41] <%Klefth> Patches snitches on eeeeveryone
[4:48:41] <jackelzxaa> Lautrec has a secret hint but it's something you have to make sure to find before bells
[4:48:42] <JdotSweapA> the UNBREAKABLE
[4:48:42] <derap41> Trusty Patches wouldn't hurt a fly
[4:48:43] <funnyfunnykid> the dude from Demon Souls?
[4:48:49] <+Catpurnicus> wait, did haircut do the deed already?
[4:48:50] <Duskendawn> Lautrec's are easy af to miss though
[4:48:51] <jackelzxaa> trusty patches is a good boy
[4:48:56] <%Deekman> @funnyfunnykid Patches is in every Miyazaki Fromsoft game
[4:48:56] <+kevlarkoala> @funnyfunnykid all of them but 2, and he's in 2 in spirit. he's even in Armored Core
[4:48:57] <Lefteron> @funnyfunnykid of course. patchs is only not in ds2
[4:48:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> You have to do everything in the game RIGHT NOW tho
[4:48:58] <Born_2_Late> game just got even more confusing. so he could technically beat the game right now?
[4:49:01] <jackelzxaa> does reggie have any +20 bonfires
[4:49:04] <@Solidus_113> there's so much to do and no good way to do it all without cheating
[4:49:05] <Aeneas1177> Patches is a multidimentional entity
[4:49:05] <rasamune> @Catpurnicus He done do'd it
[4:49:10] <youngking_kush> At this point if you are going Dark Ending the next thing would be the Artorias Door and boss there
[4:49:11] <bosssbatttle> @Born_2_Late nah
[4:49:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why not?
[4:49:15] <+kevlarkoala> @Solidus_113 well, you can play twice ;)
[4:49:15] <%pennykettle_> what
[4:49:17] <blue_grave> the sound of the hammer in this place is always comforting to me
[4:49:17] <%Dopamien> I'm literally useless and know nothing :)
[4:49:21] <%Javaa01> @funnyfunnykid More like the dude from Armored Core
[4:49:27] <%cubbywolf> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[4:49:27] <jackelzxaa> it's worth kindling at least one bonfire to +20 so you can go fill up with warps
[4:49:33] <%Valask> why is there a choice even
[4:49:35] <jackelzxaa> dark andre path
[4:49:43] <+king_of_mystery2> Woolie you should have just had him do the frampt path and then have a save loaded ready for him so he can see the kaathe stuff
[4:49:46] <zzNamttamzz> DarkMode
[4:49:51] <derap41> Andre is shining more than your silver  arrmor
[4:49:51] <RickyRelucent> divine scales good with low faith, occult with high
[4:49:51] <%cubbywolf> when you combine a bunch of One Guy you get Chat
[4:49:52] <Dabrikishaw> Occult Infusion sounds so cool, but its functionally worthless.
[4:49:55] <velgaduere> IS IT TIME?
[4:49:56] <%Valask> zekePEPE
[4:49:57] <jackelzxaa> woolie's doing good now
[4:49:58] <Zebroneath> that's a cool guy!
[4:49:58] <%BinaryFireball> think so
[4:49:58] <velgaduere> WE HAVE THE SOULS
[4:49:59] <jorniev> BIGGEST CHAD
[4:49:59] <%DapperCadavr> the guy POGGERS
[4:50:00] <@Solidus_113> my man
[4:50:01] <jackelzxaa> don't be mean to woolie
[4:50:01] <+xerotwo> TOKI WA KITA
[4:50:04] <RickyRelucent> to keep a spare claymore in your back, incase yyou run out of sunlight blades
[4:50:04] <Oculocto> BOY. Andre changes his tune after a few cycles doesn't he?
[4:50:06] <Tempmael> we have the souls
[4:50:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
[4:50:10] <jackelzxaa> this is a good reccomended path for guided tour
[4:50:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> his skin i so shiny
[4:50:23] <jackelzxaa> reggie's gonna see 90% of the game's content on this route
[4:50:23] <%Valask> I have never seen anyone do this
[4:50:28] <%atlasdotwav> Prithee moisturize
[4:50:41] <%Dopamien> Personal favorite mod, the fast andre mod calebKek
[4:50:44] <%waltzqueen> @atlasdotwav but he's already glistening with sweat
[4:50:51] <jackelzxaa> is artorias weak to ocult?
[4:50:57] <Lefteron> Velka's Raipier is one of my favorites.
[4:50:58] <+MoxaHaunt> Woolie is doing a really good job
[4:50:59] <%RemedyofRevenge> its a great weapon
[4:51:04] <derap41> And That Occult bonus damage
[4:51:04] <+pectusumbra> if you like int and rapiers then yes
[4:51:04] <RickyRelucent> @jackelzxaa i think he is occult
[4:51:10] <%Double_Tap_That> It's also a DEX weapon
[4:51:20] <subjectg> Just know that velka‚Äôs rapier also cannot be buffed
[4:51:20] <Blank9> just relies on if you like a moveset
[4:51:22] <jackelzxaa> the catch pole's weakness is it has no sweep
[4:51:25] <+BignanasTheGawd> its nice having a R2 that doesnt lung you a mile away
[4:51:29] <%atlasdotwav> @dopamien He goes so fast he gets ultra instinct afterimages
[4:51:31] <+anoldtoilet> it does hjave a sweep
[4:51:35] <youngking_kush> And its fast
[4:51:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's going to be really hard pressed to ever find anything better than the catchpole
[4:51:41] <+anoldtoilet> r1 > r1 and the roll r1 is a sweep
[4:51:41] <+kevlarkoala> @jackelzxaa Woolie just needs to stop engaging Juan Guy is all. don't always have to clap back when Juan Guy is popping off
[4:51:43] <jackelzxaa> having two good weapons is i think the best middleground for DS1
[4:51:44] <Tempmael> did we grab the seal yet?
[4:51:44] <OblivionSword1> just enough
[4:51:48] <derap41> C scaling is basically no scaling
[4:51:50] <+Grayhammatter> it's FAST
[4:51:52] <Duskendawn> Twinkling is easy to get now
[4:51:53] <%Dopamien> @atlasdotwav EVEN FURTHER BEYOND
[4:51:58] <+anoldtoilet> no One Guy can compete with woolie's own stand One Guy
[4:52:04] <Lefteron> And it maxes at 5
[4:52:08] <agustorm123> All round Reggie
[4:52:12] <KyberNasse> Astora the land of CHADS
[4:52:20] <jackelzxaa> MLGS might be the perfect second weapon for reggie.  it has a great moveset
[4:52:22] <+anoldtoilet> yeah this Dex weapon will work really well with your Str build
[4:52:23] <jorniev> sweihanderrrrrrr
[4:52:26] <haitakaa> Also Crest gives you one of the best farming spots
[4:52:36] <jackelzxaa> seath's tail will scale off of reggie's build reall well
[4:52:41] <+anoldtoilet> ^^^
[4:52:41] <youngking_kush> @jackelzxaa a fellow True Believer
[4:52:50] <subjectg> You won‚Äôt regret the upgrades, but you wWILL regret the levels
[4:52:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[4:53:19] <jackelzxaa> does the forest covenant work still
[4:53:21] <DensityD> Kappa he should have committed to a bow build Kappa
[4:53:26] <%CaptainBeird> i'm ready to see reggarth punched out
[4:53:27] <rasamune> @Valask That's an excellent question!
[4:53:28] <+xyxlzyzm> ehhh i don't like the walkup for them
[4:53:28] <DensityD> it super works
[4:53:30] <%A_German_spy> @Valask Shhh. He found it. spyCappa
[4:53:30] <%Dopamien> The Major League Gaming Sword is the destined path üôè
[4:53:30] <NumbF4ke> cut seaths tail
[4:53:36] <+pectusumbra> @jorniev you cut a dragon tail
[4:53:38] <RickyRelucent> @jackelzxaa I guess?
[4:53:40] <+studleydoorite> don't get yurself jermaOld
[4:53:42] <jorniev> kindle?
[4:53:44] <+Malysitos> That‚Äôs a good question, why *does* Andre have the Crest of Artorias?
[4:53:45] <jackelzxaa> i'd say having catch pole AND moonlight greatsword as his two main weapons that he can switch between on the fly would be a PERFECT build path
[4:53:47] <agustorm123> We fighting dogo?
[4:53:49] <+kevlarkoala> @subjectg he will not regret the levels, until he plays through the game as a pure sorcerer and goes "oh, my spells do WAY more damage"
[4:53:51] <DensityD> lets kindle a million times
[4:53:54] <jackelzxaa> it'd give him coverage for almost anything in the game
[4:54:03] <+kevlarkoala> but he will never regret the levels in THIS playthrough, his build is doing just fine
[4:54:10] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[4:54:12] <Treasure_Vault> the royal them
[4:54:15] <%pennykettle_> LUL YES GOOD REFERENCE
[4:54:16] <DensityD> hello, I am the viewer
[4:54:30] <DensityD> just cheat
[4:54:32] <subjectg> @kevlarkoala of course, but it is a major consideration for others, because this game is dumb about no respecs
[4:54:35] <agustorm123> Viewer here we know
[4:54:38] <jorniev> no I am the viewer
[4:54:38] <haitakaa> sif :(
[4:54:39] <Treasure_Vault> And Woolie will show Reggie on youtube anyway
[4:54:40] <jumpyhugs> lol let's go fight artrorias
[4:54:40] <GHouseduivel> So we haven't dealt with Sif yet?
[4:54:41] <DensityD> for the playthrough, just cheat
[4:54:43] <Johannen> You can just watch it on Youtube, yeah
[4:54:44] <%pennykettle_> awesome thank you
[4:54:44] <@Solidus_113> Sif...
[4:54:45] <zzNamttamzz> He's talking to me LuvPeekL
[4:54:45] <%espanishcanamurciana> its cool shit, just invest in cryptosouls
[4:54:46] <LunarRemix> That's good
[4:54:47] <rasamune> True lore and sad dog are mutually exclusive, which is fucked up
[4:54:51] <%spaghettiweaver> ok thats fine
[4:54:53] <+pectusumbra> yeah chat, don't worry about THAT shit
[4:54:54] <Treasure_Vault> Neato.
[4:54:55] <RickyRelucent> Imagine trying to get all the achievements for all the weapons, spells, miracles
[4:54:56] <+Grayhammatter> remind the universe
[4:54:56] <gespenstkick> Good solution woolz
[4:54:56] <@Solidus_113> it's not the same though
[4:54:57] <haitakaa> @rasamune exactly
[4:54:58] <Drusain> i am world hi
[4:54:59] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Good call.
[4:55:02] <+king_of_mystery2> Woolie is advocating pup snuffing right now
[4:55:02] <+Bitscreed> Woolie's been a good guide for Reggarth so far.
[4:55:02] <RickyRelucent> >Thats multiple playtroughs 100%
[4:55:04] <Tempmael> based woolie
[4:55:04] <youngking_kush> Can't you just cheat it like on Woolie's LP
[4:55:07] <%CaptainBeird> woolie but it's an NFT emergency!
[4:55:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> chat he wouldn't wait until after the dlc that's be crazy
[4:55:09] <subjectg> Fuck sad dog, break its bones quickly
[4:55:09] <DensityD> the dog can still be very sad, even with out that
[4:55:10] <OblivionSword1> good call for the youtube ppeps
[4:55:12] <DensityD> it can still be sad dog
[4:55:13] <urkleturtle> reggie's human, so this is gonna be fun
[4:55:14] <bosssbatttle> reggie needs to pup snuff
[4:55:16] <+vaderxyz1970> But MEEEEEEEEE though
[4:55:17] <Karhax> not pup snuffing is such a roundabout way to play the game
[4:55:17] <velgaduere> it's not about what he doesn't see Woolie, what if he doesn't do the thing I want him to tho??? woolieYIKES
[4:55:25] <@Solidus_113> the context without the dlc means nothing if he just watches it
[4:55:28] <DensityD> lol but meee
[4:55:34] <Jewoodsforreal> I recomend dlc before pup snuffing
[4:55:34] <Born_2_Late> did they beat the titanite demon in anor londo?
[4:55:35] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Hey.. It's that dog
[4:55:39] <%superc37> alternatively they could just get someone like plague or spy to drop them the ring
[4:55:42] <Johannen> You still have a wounded boss and a wounded puppy you save, which is also nice
[4:55:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> time to get stinky
[4:55:48] <%Lordgale119> @Solidus_113 he'll wait until the DLC, Woolie FOUGHT to have that context for his own run
[4:55:51] <dimensaur> what the dog doin
[4:55:51] <%baka_sugoi> SMELLS C L E A N
[4:55:52] <%Lordgale119> I have faith in him
[4:55:52] <thotacon_tv> You cant get Kaathe and the sif cutscence on the same play through anyway chat
[4:55:53] <%SarcFa> @Solidus_113 Could show him the alt scene after the DLC
[4:55:55] <agustorm123> FrankerZ
[4:56:06] <+Bitscreed> Time to get that petrichor smell on you now Reggarth.
[4:56:09] <%superc37> @thotacon_tv you can with some cheating
[4:56:12] <%atlasdotwav> Bork Breakers ‚Ñ¢
[4:56:17] <+askalta> dlc?
[4:56:35] <DensityD> also the rite of kindling
[4:56:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imo i think seeing the original sif scene first is better because it makes the alt hit harder
[4:56:39] <%Rafraud> Wait he struggled on pinwheel?
[4:56:40] <%Valask> I really think pinwheel was meant to be done first
[4:56:42] <Tempmael> did we discover the GCS here?
[4:56:43] <subjectg> i killed pinwheel in 3 swings in my last playthrough
[4:56:54] <+Shishi1205> no?
[4:56:54] <RickyRelucent> you uhh did
[4:56:55] <Karhax> i dont think you can parry trees
[4:56:57] <Duskendawn> Reg already breezing through most of the previous zones LUL
[4:56:59] <RickyRelucent> when u went for the butterfly
[4:57:01] <DensityD> humanoid, human sized enemy, that is the criteria for parry
[4:57:02] <+0neReeler> has to be human
[4:57:05] <gryffinp> @Solidus_113 "you can do it if you mod the game" is a meaningless statement. You can play HALO in dark souls if you mod the game.
[4:57:06] <%Rafraud> FORESHADOWING
[4:57:08] <sendart> partial parry everything
[4:57:10] <RickyRelucent> the triple tree treat

[5:04:42] <Johannen> Shiva is only for coveneant members
[5:04:44] <RickyRelucent> @Valask gotta be in the covenant, talk to the kitty : 3
[5:04:44] <gryffinp> @WoolieVersus according to the dark souls wikidot, there is no cooldown timer for the forest invaders

[5:05:27] <gryffinp> @WoolieVersus of course, dried fingering will reset the timers for OTHER types of invaders
[5:05:32] <%Valask> I mean do it anyway
[5:05:33] <velgaduere> just gonna not kill that dude I suppose
[5:05:34] <punchgroin> my favorite farm is killing the phalanx in the painted world over and over again with firestorm
[5:05:34] <%SarcFa> honestly cooldown might've been changed in remaster compared to original release
[5:05:35] <Duskendawn> Got all that souls back from buying the crest
[5:05:36] <KyberNasse> The woods are quiet
[5:05:38] <wyldcarde> nah. they get mad if ninja dies. i went through that kicking myth.
[5:05:40] <%waltzqueen> too quiet
[5:05:42] <%TheOddJik> Yeah still use the dried finger!

[5:06:11] <subjectg> Maybe you‚Äôll get a moonbro showing up
[5:06:12] <%cubbywolf> just dry finger yourself anyways
[5:06:13] <Karhax> Reggie is eligible to be invaded by dark moon blades as he is a sinner that killed gwynevere
[5:06:15] <%cubbywolf> don't trust chat
[5:06:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit
[5:06:20] <jackelzxaa> and later on in the playthrough it'd be worth emptying logan's shop for quest reasons

[5:06:37] <%waltzqueen> !MOSS!
[5:06:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I'm inclined to blame this on the Remaster's garbage matching and the generally lower player population now, yeah
[5:06:43] <jumpyhugs> DS1 is a shard game? snap
[5:06:46] <%Javaa01> Yes, the remaster is trash, this is known
[5:06:50] <sendart> think reggie is also at a weird level for invasions

[5:07:06] <subjectg> Also because of how reggie has a maxed catch pole he may be getting matched up with real killers in pvp
[5:07:06] <jackelzxaa> he never
[5:07:06] <+kevlarkoala> @Karhax do you become a sinner if you just use the ring, or is that specific to killing gwyenevere
[5:07:07] <gryffinp> It doesn't help that a lot of players just refuse to use the remaster, because fuck, why buy the game again to get a worse version

[5:07:26] <%TheOddJik> @A_German_spy I was playing through for my first time last month and had LOTS of invasions on the remaster. Might be a specific issue with the remaster on PC?
[5:07:27] <%funya_rinpa> There are others besides the forest hunters trying to invade though, would increase your chances if you popped the finger
[5:07:31] <Duskendawn> Careful the hydra does fire and poison  (this joke is for nobody)

[5:13:17] <+askalta> go for 20
[5:13:17] <%Deekman> lmao
[5:13:21] <agustorm123> Hope you stay here longer
[5:13:26] <%atlasdotwav> But a PvP purpose build will absolutely be hard for your PvE build

[5:13:32] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:13:37] <urkleturtle> forest invaders are a special case in that they are only level restricted down, they can invade infinitely up
[5:13:41] <%holydeviant1> PvP Souls, yeyeyeyeyey
[5:13:45] <subjectg> they‚Äôd also have a high chance of having buffs as we‚Äôve seen, and sunlight blade is awesome
[5:13:48] <gryffinp> I like a good 20

[5:14:16] <%cubbywolf> finger him dry
[5:14:20] <%atlasdotwav> 2 hand
[5:14:22] <urkleturtle> that's why forest invaders tend to have real killer builds that can take care of people who are lvl200+
[5:14:23] <jackelzxaa> the dlc area with the humanity spirits are good for farming humanity
[5:14:30] <Johannen> try finger but hole?

[5:19:55] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Now that I think of it, QLOC did change some of the online mechanics in the Remaster besides just the matching conditions. Things like being able to use Estus as an invader. I believe one of those changes was that the invasion cooldown now affects this area, when it didn't in the original, hence the Dried Finger now actually helping here.

[5:21:11] <%holydeviant1> (no literally
[5:21:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have literally been sucked backwards upwards of fifty or sixty feet and turned 180 degrees to be backstabbed
[5:21:11] <ardientejuan> Logan is lo-gone
[5:21:12] <+Jiggisnipe> @TigerCatGo 5 hrs 26 min
[5:21:12] <RickyRelucent> but thats y'know
[5:21:15] <Johannen> Doesnt his pupil get his spells?
[5:21:19] <@Solidus_113> nerd town

[5:21:29] <Razeino> Could go to the archives. Best place to go to get spells.
[5:21:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, a failsafe
[5:21:34] <+warlockwithapixie> LUL

[5:22:02] <%TigerCatGo> @Jiggisnipe DAYUM, guess I;ll pause and watch the VOD later. THANK YOU!!
[5:22:05] <%Prevot> I don't think its everything
[5:22:12] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus He wont sell duplicates
[5:22:13] <@Solidus_113> soulmass good
[5:22:23] <RickyRelucent> you got the lord vessel
[5:22:26] <RickyRelucent> welp
[5:22:28] <Duskendawn> On the hunt for bigger hats
[5:22:28] <%KBGuilty> soulmass indeed good
[5:22:32] <Lefteron> He is on the magic grindset
[5:22:50] <%A_German_spy> They're fantastic.
[5:22:50] <jackelzxaa> master logan is goku
[5:22:54] <jackelzxaa> always going out to fight
[5:23:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> more damage or longer effects
[5:23:08] <%funya_rinpa> Soul Mass plus Bellowing would be best before Spear which you can't use
[5:23:14] <haitakaa> homing first
[5:23:20] <Duskendawn> You can buy everything if you take a bit of time farming the forest
[5:23:21] <Karhax> get homing
[5:23:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 9 levels damn
[5:23:25] <%Dopamien> slightly too dumb FeelsBadMan
[5:23:35] <Johannen> Ring would be beneficial
[5:23:41] <%ronin19xx> Huge commitment
[5:23:42] <sendart> ring also affects pyro
[5:23:44] <Treasure_Vault> Pumping int is fine, boosts his Pole damage better than strength, i believe.
[5:23:48] <%Valask> he's on his way to perfect the legend build
[5:23:50] <+askalta> soul spear or soul mass?
[5:23:53] <SethYuikora> soulmass is good passive help.
[5:23:54] <%superc37> oh dear god what is this abomination reggie is wearing
[5:24:00] <jackelzxaa> if you empty this guy's shop it progresses his quest too
[5:24:00] <$JobbedBone> Int is just a made up stat anyways FeelsBadMan
[5:24:02] <Born_2_Late> i wonder what the world outside lordran looks like
[5:24:07] <KyberNasse> Logan senpai
[5:24:11] <RickyRelucent> Bastard Son Build
[5:24:11] <%cubbywolf> now murder him
[5:24:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah int will REALLY crank the catchpole
[5:24:16] <%superc37> @born_2_late fucked
[5:24:28] <%Valask> do you have any of Kirk's shit?
[5:24:31] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you want to use up those souls before you go, Bellowing Dragoncrest Ring is a worthy acquisition for boosting sorcery damage.
[5:24:31] <+robertoszek> friendly fire?
[5:24:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hope the soul mass is benign
[5:24:36] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Bone back to the forest, the quickest way
[5:24:39] <%Valask> it's really good for cancelling backstabs
[5:24:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Valask don't think so
[5:24:51] <haitakaa> always worth it to fap
[5:24:56] <%ronin19xx> Reggies weapon does stupid damage, man
[5:25:11] <%A_German_spy> Yup!
[5:25:25] <Duskendawn> Remind reg that the rings also boost his pyro damage iirc
[5:25:26] <Johannen> We are doing magic now)
[5:25:30] <%Valask> Spy confirm this for me, DEX increases cast speed right?
[5:25:32] <%A_German_spy> @Duskendawn That's correct
[5:25:34] <velgaduere> just make sure to actually use your sorceries
[5:25:39] <%A_German_spy> @Valask Yes it does, up to a cap
[5:25:41] <vVAstrAVv> HE FINALLY GOT IT LADS
[5:25:47] <agustorm123> You are a wizard Reggie
[5:25:58] <velgaduere> why bone when warp?

[5:26:19] <+Shishi1205> attune bbby
[5:26:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> round 4?
[5:26:24] <subjectg> salty runback?
[5:26:34] <%CaptainBeird> doesn't bellowing work for pyromancy too? or am i insane
[5:26:43] <+askalta> it does
[5:26:44] <+Shishi1205> it does
[5:26:48] <glass_marcus> it does
[5:26:48] <%Valask> is it just 4?
[5:26:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait only 4?
[5:26:54] <velgaduere> LUL
[5:26:55] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:26:58] <Duskendawn> Absolutely salty runback LUL
[5:27:06] <jackelzxaa> if reggie keeps leveling his int his spells will far outclass the chaos fire
[5:27:12] <%pupil31> BOP BOP BOP
[5:27:16] <jackelzxaa> it went from 9 to 8
[5:27:18] <velgaduere> BYOOM

[5:27:23] <%pupil31> BUH BUH BUH
[5:27:24] <@Solidus_113> power
[5:27:26] <%CateHecate> magic itano circus
[5:27:27] <haitakaa> and you do it before entering combat
[5:27:28] <+Chimeraelite> Homing soulmass is ALWAYS the shit
[5:27:29] <+zepherl> magic is reallllllll good in this game
[5:27:32] <Treasure_Vault> Set and forget
[5:27:44] <RickyRelucent> @jackelzxaa  any spells will outclass pyromancies. Its still the free optpion
[5:27:45] <subjectg> One of my favorite part of cursed halo is  the homing soulmass wraiths
[5:27:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bzzt
[5:27:47] <%Valask> are we labbing
[5:27:53] <Duskendawn> Also homing soulmass sucks if you don't look away until enemies get closer. It'll fire at max range and miss. In pvp anyways
[5:27:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1465556863949357058?t=vTY0O4ob-x0PxHn39K9_yQ&s=19

[5:36:59] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So Reggie, in PvP you have to parry slightly early due to the latency.
[5:37:01] <OverlordedK> coulda won if he didn't parry
[5:37:02] <velgaduere> netcode too terrible for decent parries
[5:37:04] <Pie_Mastyr> you gotta parry earlier in pvp

[5:51:33] <%ronin19xx> What a mish mash of armor pieces lol
[5:51:34] <+askalta> hey
[5:51:40] <SethYuikora> weeb spotted
[5:51:42] <%Valask> people love this covenant because you don't need humanity for it
[5:51:42] <Karhax> flippy boy
[5:51:44] <justcallmebobplease> @Dakuu75 ThatsTheJoke.jpg
[5:51:46] <Duskendawn> Inform reggie about the ninja ring
[5:51:47] <velgaduere> ...
[5:51:50] <youngking_kush> Shinobi?
[5:51:57] <bestwaifuritsu> "If I dont say anything maybe he wont see me"
[5:52:02] <RickyRelucent> @ronin19xx he travveled away from the east, and pillages armor. Gotta make repairs right
[5:52:04] <%Valask> he also has teh ninja flip ring
[5:52:06] <youngking_kush> "..."
[5:52:10] <Karhax> reduces lock on range
[5:52:13] <justcallmebobplease> OR, you trade a Skull Lantern with Snuggly
[5:52:14] <%Valask> insane I frames
[5:52:19] <youngking_kush> HE ALSO IS A RING
[5:52:21] <%holydeviant1> It takes skill to pronounce ellipses
[5:52:26] <+eanscrale> That ring used to be the most bullshit item in the entire game
[5:52:27] <%holydeviant1> Most people are just quiet
[5:52:31] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you can trade a skull lantern for that ring too
[5:52:38] <+patel347> you can also buy shit off him in blighttown
[5:52:43] <%Cozy90> He sells stuff in blight town
[5:52:44] <%SarcFa> Shiva can also show up as a merchant in blightown
[5:52:49] <velgaduere> Shiva basically betrays the covenant somewhere else by hunting you
[5:52:51] <agustorm123> Doge
[5:53:23] <RickyRelucent> @velgaduere No, thats actually never put ingame, the assets are in the files tho

[5:53:31] <FrostedZaibatsu> The betrays you for a sword he wants
[5:53:34] <RickyRelucent> It was with the chaos blade, like hiltless or w/er in DES
[5:53:48] <RickyRelucent> but in dks1, shiva just moves to blight town after joining
[5:53:50] <+patel347> yeah if you go there, he will show up
[5:53:52] <haitakaa> some cool as stuff
[5:53:53] <slackerunchained> Shiva betraying the covenant is cut-content, I think.
[5:53:53] <RickyRelucent> there it is
[5:53:57] <Duskendawn> Lantern trades for fog ring or ninja flip ring?
[5:54:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus He appears there and in the forest at the same time)

[6:03:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[6:03:22] <%diathex> la magie
[6:03:23] <sendart> could enchant a halberd for a similar moveset
[6:03:29] <Duskendawn> Difference is more scaling or more raw iirc?
[6:03:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> is that the pitter patter of lil mush feet I'm hearing?
[6:03:47] <%holydeviant1> I think Enchanted is EXTREME scaling?

[6:13:19] <+EySoyCoco> yo this pt
[6:13:21] <Scrub_of_scrubs> LUCKY TED
[6:13:21] <@Solidus_113> The Remaster boosted their spawn rate
[6:13:22] <Lefteron> They are incedibly rare
[6:13:23] <Rawbone_saw> WHAT
[6:13:24] <Sunstalker> No Black Phantoms are
[6:13:24] <Estuko> @Solidus_113 FeelsBadMan special to me
[6:13:24] <28moogles> They mean a lot of souls have been lost there.
[6:13:25] <Rawbone_saw> DID I MISS
[6:13:26] <WhereIsWill> ive never seen one in game
[6:13:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> I think it's dropping items
[6:13:27] <derap41> red are common blue are rare
[6:13:27] <Onamar> They spawn in someone else's world if someone leaves their souls or an item for too long
[6:13:27] <primaryfire> vagrants are extremely rare online enemies
[6:13:27] <JdotSweapA> REGGIES RUN IS SUPER BLESSED
[6:13:28] <%pennykettle_> Ive only seen 2
[6:13:28] <Rawbone_saw> THE VAGARNT????
[6:13:29] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> a COUPLE?
[6:13:30] <Duskendawn> I've never seen a vagrant ever when I played
[6:13:31] <%RickyRelucent> Lucky Reg
[6:13:31] <gespenstkick> they are online related
[6:13:32] <Rawbone_saw> OMG
[6:13:32] <+kevlarkoala> they're rare in the OG game. In Remaster you see them CONSTANTLY
[6:13:35] <%Grimlockfly> nah, it's when you die twice, it creates a vagrant in another players game
[6:13:36] <%pennykettle_> Reggie doesnt even care LUL
[6:13:37] <slackerunchained> They're linked to people dropping Humanity or items in other game sessions.
[6:13:38] <+cdrom321> They're dropped items that stuck around too long.
[6:13:39] <%holydeviant1> Theyre still extremely rare, spawned by dropped items
[6:13:41] <%funya_rinpa> I never saw those in PTDE and was very confused on my remaster run
[6:13:45] <+Solutha> only seen one in OG dark souls
[6:13:45] <jackelzxaa> lucky reggie
[6:13:46] <+kevlarkoala> i'd never seen one until i finally played Remastered
[6:13:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> I didn't know that existed
[6:13:47] <%Dopamien> Reggie wins the lottery again FeelsBadMan
[6:13:49] <Rawbone_saw> I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN ONE
[6:13:49] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus The Path right of Shiva is the safest way
[6:13:49] <jackelzxaa> reggie has the devil's luck
[6:13:51] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Other red phantom enemies are linked to Gravelords, but those little orb crabs are something totally different, yeah. Just an incredibly rare, online-only enemy.
[6:13:53] <JdotSweapA> HE KNOWS NOT WHAT HE HAS NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[6:13:56] <%SarcFa> nah, vagrants are super weird online shit, either dropped items or lost souls puddles become vagrants in other peoples worlds supposedly
[6:13:56] <vVAstrAVv> i think gravelords make phantom enemies like black tendeancy idk tho
[6:13:57] <%Valask> @Grimlockfly isn't it when you drop a super rare item and die
[6:13:57] <%Ensign_Epic> vagrants aren't super rare. hang out in the right places for long enough and you'll see one
[6:13:57] <+Malysitos> Lucky Regg‚Ä¶ if only he knew
[6:13:59] <+Reverend_Roscoe> just hug the left wall
[6:14:00] <VHGS> a bad vagrant appears when someone loses a bloodstain with 5 soft humanity. It becomes a fancy red vagrant when it gets passed around to 20 games without being killed.
[6:14:02] <MrATheGreat> Red vagrants are made when people invade and leave stuff in someone else's world. If it isn't picked up, it becomes a vagrant in someone else's world iirc.
[6:14:24] <%Ensign_Epic> nope
[6:14:26] <%Grimlockfly> @Valask it's you die twice, the 'souls' appear as vagrant in some other guys game
[6:14:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cats should be gone
[6:14:30] <%Ensign_Epic> lemme get the page
[6:14:38] <%holydeviant1> @VHGS Reds are from humanity loss, blue are from item loss
[6:14:43] <%Valask> @pennykettle_ monka
[6:14:47] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Vagrant are created when people lose huge amount of souls and humanity
[6:14:51] <%RickyRelucent> He should spread vagrants worldwide by dropping dungpies everyywhere
[6:14:54] <%RickyRelucent> we*
[6:14:58] <%Grimlockfly> @Johannen this
[6:15:01] <%SarcFa> cats didn't respawn
[6:15:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no more cats
[6:15:04] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> Now he only needs to see one of these ultra rare white rings, which boost miracles
[6:15:05] <+robertoszek> sound is so jank on the remaster, my god
[6:15:07] <%pennykettle_> my penis is safe
[6:15:09] <subjectg> Well well well, look who aren‚Äôt here
[6:15:11] <KaiserMario> Where are the cats huh?
[6:15:13] <dalmek> for now
[6:15:15] <%CaptainBeird> are we just gonna let reggie take the long hard way to the hydra?
[6:15:16] <%A_German_spy> @pennykettle_ Psych! spyServed
[6:15:17] <%Valask> @robertoszek always been
[6:15:21] <%Ensign_Epic> http://darksouls.wikidot.com/vagrant
[6:15:28] <%A_German_spy> @pennykettle_ Sorry, that was mean of me.
[6:15:32] <%Ensign_Epic> that was an upgraded version of a good vagrant
[6:15:39] <%pennykettle_> @A_German_spy faetroLuv faetroLuv faetroSif03
[6:15:40] <Qu1ckyyy> cmon Reggie you can do it!
[6:15:42] <+robertoszek> @Valask true that
[6:15:42] <%Grimlockfly> lucky woolie
[6:15:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh my god they're down there
[6:15:44] <+vaderxyz1970> Reggie saw a Hermit!?!
[6:15:44] <%Ensign_Epic> that one appears when an item is dropped not a blood stain
[6:15:47] <Rawbone_saw> 3 OR 4?????
[6:15:51] <Slim_Lipid> FOUR????
[6:15:53] <LunarRemix> That's really lucky
[6:15:55] <jackelzxaa> doesnt dropping items randomly throughout the world, instead of using bottomless box, cause vagrants to spawn too?
[6:15:56] <Sunstalker> Some of those can cast homing soulspears and they'll do a shit ton of dmg
[6:15:56] <FrostedZaibatsu> Will you make it back up?
[6:15:56] <Dabrikishaw> Varants are rare as fuck.
[6:15:57] <velgaduere> you could bone
[6:16:01] <Treasure_Vault> put a bone on your quickbar
[6:16:02] <Born_2_Late> just fight
[6:16:03] <$JobbedBone> retae ekans D:
[6:16:08] <%Valask> I only saw one and I played this shit for 400 hours
[6:16:08] <%holydeviant1> To put it another way: It's rare enough that people aren't sure how they spawn. :V
[6:16:09] <+meteor530> Do not coward reggie. Fight and die....WITH HONOR
[6:16:15] <Pubstar_LTD> Oh wow so thats what those are...Never knew and I beat the game like 5 times LUL
[6:16:15] <VHGS> @jackelzxaa Dropped items can eventually become good vagrants, which are not hostile.
[6:16:20] <+robertoszek> what a thriiiiiiiill
[6:16:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @jobbedbone lol
[6:16:24] <+vaderxyz1970> Ive played 500+ hours and only seen One
[6:16:26] <%pupil31> Spit on em
[6:16:27] <%Ensign_Epic> that was an upgraded good vagrant
[6:16:28] <Deko_> LUL
[6:16:28] <%A_German_spy> @holydeviant1 And that the normal experience is to go through the entire game and never see one.
[6:16:29] <vVAstrAVv> this seems like the worst approach to hydra
[6:16:30] <%townzzzzz> EZ POINTS
[6:16:33] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[6:16:34] <agustorm123> We dying
[6:16:35] <subjectg> @sunstalker the cute round ones are ‚Äúgood‚Äù vagrants, no matter the color. The spiky ones are bad vagrants that shoot
[6:16:36] <gryffinp> this is why I keep a homeward bone on my hot bar
[6:16:40] <xanerts> I  playes ds1 10 times and never encountered a vagrant
[6:16:40] <+derpumpkinking> I believed
[6:16:40] <b_ikki> cant wait until he falls
[6:16:40] <%pupil31> HAHAH
[6:16:41] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:16:42] <PunkZedB> if you can dodge a water projectile you can dodge a ball
[6:16:45] <%Ensign_Epic> I see upgraded bad vagrants all the time but I rarely see good vagrants because they require item drops
[6:16:48] <+Malysitos> llirht a tahW
[6:16:48] <+liquidzr0> PokCroagunk
[6:16:49] <%pupil31> Fucking shotos
[6:16:51] <Sunstalker> PepePls this is the true experience
[6:16:55] <jackelzxaa> Splish Splash, we takin' a bath!
[6:16:57] <%Ensign_Epic> that one required somebody to drop a pretty solid item in the world
[6:16:57] <KaiserMario> Reggie's luck is off the charts, to compensate for his lack of PvP skill
[6:17:04] <%pupil31> ICY BOI LUL
[6:17:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[6:17:09] <+robertoszek> go Reggie go! go Reggie go!
[6:17:11] <%pennykettle_> there is a safer route here from the same bonfire too faetroYouded02
[6:17:12] <gryffinp> oh he died
[6:17:12] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL LUL
[6:17:13] <+meteor530> That Hydra has NO HONOR
[6:17:13] <Johannen> Magic Shield would be helpfull right now)
[6:17:14] <comicalmond> Kappa
[6:17:15] <%Valask> oh I had no idea that could happen
[6:17:16] <jackelzxaa> reggie's first golem

[6:17:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> Well now you know
[6:17:23] <velgaduere> forgot to sip, so the hydra hydrated him
[6:17:26] <sendart> just have him come the other direction lol
[6:17:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Pay up!
[6:17:28] <%livlinn> gaijinAnimateYOOO
[6:17:30] <%Grimlockfly> you can block those with shield anyway
[6:17:31] <Treasure_Vault> SO?
[6:17:31] <jackelzxaa> put that water ring on
[6:17:31] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus The safest and quickest way back would be on the right of Shiva
[6:17:33] <%holydeviant1> This hydra is rude as hell, not even coming to shore
[6:17:33] <+kevlarkoala> Reggie's at point of the game where OP or not, it's still annoying as hell lmao
[6:17:33] <vVAstrAVv> dope
[6:17:34] <Tempmael> you thought
[6:17:35] <+robertoszek> ring up
[6:17:45] <Treasure_Vault> so you wanted to reach the ground with no health
[6:17:47] <%Lordgale119> WOOLIE
[6:17:49] <%jonblnt> Go the long way around
[6:17:50] <stormhawk9891> It's been a lucrative session for points
[6:17:51] <%pennykettle_> There is that basin ramp the other direction
[6:17:52] <%Lordgale119> STOP MAKING HIM GO THE LONG WAY
[6:17:56] <youngking_kush> If Reggie dies more to the first Hydra than to O&S I'm gonna lose my shit lmao
[6:17:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is the run tho
[6:18:17] <%pennykettle_> its fine its confusing
[6:18:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @youngking_kush better get to a toilet soon
[6:18:21] <$Rumbutt> the bridge Reggie used the first time he went there
[6:18:22] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You came out of it previosly when Reggie was lost for a second
[6:18:24] <%Lordgale119> BASIN FROM ANDRE
[6:18:24] <sendart> havels tower
[6:18:25] <%Prevot> what do you mean you don't know
[6:18:29] <@Solidus_113> just run down the hill where you get grass crest
[6:18:29] <Duskendawn> Hydra almost on par with O&S Kappa
[6:18:30] <%CaptainBeird> no from the basin entrance on the other side
[6:18:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> Its right where you Fight Havel
[6:18:33] <Drusain> Havel tower
[6:18:37] <comicalmond> 3rd try let's go
[6:18:38] <@Solidus_113> between andre and havel
[6:18:43] <Treasure_Vault> But reggie hasn't found it yet
[6:18:45] <%pennykettle_> Yea theres an easier route but reggie hasnt done it yet so it might be intimidating
[6:18:46] <Karhax> from the basin, or from havel
[6:18:46] <mikesapartment> there's a bonfire at the bottom of the basin from andre
[6:18:47] <youngking_kush> Yeah if you just go down the path from Andre he's literally right there
[6:18:48] <+Reverend_Roscoe> havel tower and from andre
[6:18:51] <%RickyRelucent> or up
[6:18:51] <Treasure_Vault> Don't complete the route if reggie hasn't found the route
[6:18:51] <vVAstrAVv> by havel tower or drake valley
[6:18:54] <Tempmael> let reggie go where he wants
[6:18:55] <%Double_Tap_That> Remember how you looped back to the hunter area?
[6:18:57] <gespenstkick> Basin and Havel
[6:19:08] <+Bitscreed> Ring of sacrifice?

[6:19:59] <+meteor530> @WoolieVersus Did you know that the guy who wrote Battle Chasers is back on the comics?

[6:21:41] <+meteor530> Much cleaner
[6:21:41] <%Ensign_Epic> bonfire in the cave is good for both Hydra and four Kings

[6:22:10] <youngking_kush> I always forget about that Bonfire behind the Grass Crest
[6:22:11] <%ronin19xx> Easy there Woolz
[6:22:14] <%pennykettle_> All the easy ways down there are ways reggie has never been before
[6:22:21] <%pennykettle_> So harder
[6:22:26] <youngking_kush> It's a short walk even from here tho
[6:22:28] <+robertoszek> Woolie don't hollow out!
[6:22:33] <Born_2_Late> no boss fights attempts?
[6:22:38] <%jonblnt> You could have continued to run up the shore
[6:22:42] <%RickyRelucent> @youngking_kush you'd have to go to the valley of the drakes and let to activate the new londo elevator, so it'd go down when you pull the lever at the bonfire
[6:22:44] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie protecting Reggie like the meme again
[6:22:44] <%ronin19xx> @Awesome_Leaf 6.5 hour stream
[6:22:46] <+silent__chief> its really not a big deal
[6:22:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> show him every shortcut right away
[6:22:57] <Awesome_Leaf> holy cow it is
[6:22:59] <DensityD> YEAH YOU BETTER
[6:23:00] <jackelzxaa> stream babies are impatient and want thing to happen NOW instead of reggie going "oh SHIT cool!"
[6:23:00] <@Solidus_113> it's a different entrance
[6:23:00] <velgaduere> it feels like every time chat is told to chill, they think it's only for that one time and not forever lobosKek
[6:23:04] <Awesome_Leaf> long sitting today
[6:23:05] <Johannen> He already used that "shortcut" they just were lost
[6:23:07] <%CaptainBeird> he has looked at them though and seen the hydra from other vantages
[6:23:08] <%Ensign_Epic> @rickyrelucent no you don't lmao
[6:23:12] <%BisoromiBear> Tell him how to beat the final boss right now
[6:23:14] <%Dopamien> first playthroughs chats are so insufferable lmao
[6:23:18] <+meteor530> Woolie the Lost
[6:23:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is it time??
[6:23:19] <%ronin19xx> @Awesome_Leaf Extremely eventful too
[6:23:22] <%Ensign_Epic> an elevator is active from both ends
[6:23:22] <Treasure_Vault> @BisoromiBear He's said it like 8 times though
[6:23:23] <DensityD> sad dog and sad cat
[6:23:26] <DensityD> sad hydra

[6:23:36] <%BisoromiBear> @BisoromiBear Fair
[6:23:36] <%Deekman> Long stream today
[6:23:37] <DensityD> woolie getting frustrated
[6:23:43] <+anoldtoilet> nothing is more insufferable than backseat mods and people who pop up just to complain about the chat that theyre part of Kappa
[6:23:45] <Duskendawn> Oh wait pre-dlc sif?
[6:23:45] <+Bitscreed> I commend you for your patience, Woolie.
[6:23:47] <%RickyRelucent> you cant enter drake valley without going trough it
[6:23:51] <Awesome_Leaf> @ronin19xx i left after gwendolyn what i miss?
[6:23:51] <jackelzxaa> you can approach the hydra from blighttown using quelaag's secret bubble dome machine.
[6:24:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you roll off that cliff and do a 360 you land in the final chamber and win the game
[6:24:04] <%kewlmyc> Woolie gets frustrated anytime he argues with chat

[6:27:58] <Make_me_mad> How do you even accidentally jump into an attack in this game...
[6:28:02] <+kevlarkoala> Sif smelled the perfumes Reggie had from his trip to Anor Londo
[6:28:03] <%BisoromiBear> puppy paw pads...
[6:28:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bork has busted him
[6:28:05] <%Ensign_Epic> specifics just different enough that I was sure he was dying
[6:28:10] <solus_is_watching> good evening gamers
[6:28:10] <Treasure_Vault> If I had a nickel every time Reggie jumped into attacks for extra damage, I'd have a lot of nickels

[6:28:25] <+Krasmeyts> Oh my god, THIS was the urban violence that Plague predicted???
[6:28:26] <+kevlarkoala> Sif smelled perfume, and she smelled bitch (love you reggie!)
[6:28:32] <youngking_kush> I definitely bet on Reggi3 to 1-shot Sif

[6:36:00] <Razeino> Grass Crest Shield would give that stamina recovery too.
[6:36:04] <subjectg> @duskendawn that spin attack does a surprising amount to cocky players
[6:36:06] <+trackles_64> payout for doubters gonna be huge

[6:36:21] <DensityD> who cares if you can't see? can you do damage?
[6:36:22] <%SarcFa> @Duskendawn He keeps trying to dodge when he's iffy on dodge timings, so he keeps getting counter-hit damaged

[6:40:01] <+Krasmeyts> Kings hate it.
[6:40:02] <Teras_ode> doctors hate him
[6:40:03] <%Ensign_Epic> @linsp it's totally not though, if you remember who the ring belonged to
[6:40:03] <%AbnormalVoid> it's weird how you don't need that for the DLC area
[6:40:06] <Duskendawn> ALL KINGS HATE HIM
[6:40:08] <velgaduere> kee-aran
[6:40:11] <Dabrikishaw> @counterfeitgimmicks PREACE
[6:40:14] <Johannen> Kee-ran?
[6:40:16] <%CaptainBeird> @linsp not really honestly
[6:40:17] <%hax_metatron> ALL FOUR NOW
[6:40:21] <velgaduere> it's an Irish name
[6:40:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> Kee yar anne
[6:40:25] <DensityD> gaelic
[6:40:25] <+kevlarkoala> so I'm assuming there's a mod that will let me just BUY the Catch Pole, right?
[6:40:27] <gryffinp> Seearan? Keearan? Sheearan? fukkin irish.
[6:40:28] <+TopTieramisu> ciaran üôè
[6:40:30] <%hax_metatron> It‚Äôs Irish, ‚ÄúKiran‚Äù
[6:40:30] <Teras_ode> key ran
[6:40:32] <Lefteron> The full set
[6:40:35] <+kevlarkoala> i've literally never had it drop, and holy shit I want to use this thing
[6:40:35] <+Krasmeyts> Still hot.
[6:40:36] <youngking_kush> I thought it was Kieran
[6:40:38] <%Lordgale119> Kee-ran, like the team four star member
[6:40:38] <+Noraje> Karen
[6:40:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Backstabs and ripostes
[6:40:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ed Sheeran
[6:40:41] <$Rumbutt> ripostes and backstabs
[6:40:42] <LunarRemix> Counter and Riposte
[6:40:43] <Oqzar> riposte and backstab
[6:40:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> backstabs and ripostes
[6:40:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus backstabs and riposts
[6:40:51] <slackerunchained> Entitled Knight Karen
[6:40:55] <%superc37> @woolieversus its "kier-raan"
[6:41:05] <Duskendawn> It's a goddamn zoo in here!
[6:41:06] <BurdRightsActivist> Furry
[6:41:08] <%pennykettle_> Damn I want my family to have their own rings
[6:41:08] <subjectg> @kevlarkoala the halberd scythe (bardiche) is a good alternative and easier to build with since it‚Äôs just dex
[6:41:10] <$SilverRoddo> Counters and repo-men
[6:41:11] <youngking_kush> Lion, Wolf, Hawk, Hornet
[6:41:14] <subjectg> or the garg halberd
[6:41:18] <+Shoosler> all junk
[6:41:21] <Lefteron> I ponder what Smough would have gotten. Hippo perhaps
[6:41:21] <wqorst> imagine getting hornet when everyone else gets lion and wolf and shit
[6:41:22] <%seydaq> sir artorius would not aprove, this pronounciation LUL
[6:41:22] <%RickyRelucent> for all stabs
[6:41:24] <+pectusumbra> poise ring
[6:41:24] <%RickyRelucent> actually
[6:41:26] <LunarRemix> You also get different animations for every weapon type
[6:41:27] <%RickyRelucent> even a warpick
[6:41:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> poise
[6:41:28] <NumbF4ke> poise
[6:41:32] <$Rumbutt> Wolf Ring is poise
[6:41:35] <niffinbox> gywns power rangers
[6:41:36] <Karhax> not getting interupted with slow attacks, poise
[6:41:40] <%Ensign_Epic> Wolf is 40 poise
[6:41:41] <DensityD> boost poise for big boys
[6:41:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Big poise for big boys
[6:41:44] <+pectusumbra> soul of sif
[6:41:45] <%SarcFa> sif soul
[6:41:46] <%CaptainBeird> sorry for stressing you out about directions earlier btw woolie
[6:41:47] <%hax_metatron> POISE
[6:41:52] <%RickyRelucent> 40
[6:41:54] <slackerunchained> Working as intended.
[6:41:56] <youngking_kush> Wolf Ring is big poise for big bois
[6:41:57] <+Jiggisnipe> Artorias was a big boi who tanked attacks maybe
[6:42:01] <%Lion_kun> Reggie should make the A.S just to see what it looks like
[6:42:07] <subjectg> 56 is a good number for your poise
[6:42:13] <%Lion_kun> Artorias Sword*
[6:42:22] <%seydaq> if only you had 4 fingers
[6:42:22] <%hax_metatron> I love that Artorias had the poise ring because he wanted to be jumpy and flippy with a light armor.
[6:42:29] <Teras_ode> so Reggie hasn't committed to 'FaP' yet?
[6:42:45] <@Solidus_113> Multiple
[6:42:46] <subjectg> i hate that you need 3 of this pupper‚Äôs soul to get the achievement
[6:42:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dog soul
[6:42:48] <velgaduere> @Teras_ode nope, still plenty more game to see
[6:42:55] <%Ensign_Epic> @hax_metatron poise has no impact on equip load
[6:43:02] <%pennykettle_> Im sure the old giant blacksmith will be thrilled you killed his coworker's dog
[6:43:06] <mortalmanbaby> is reggie gonna do dlc???/
[6:43:08] <Lefteron> I got BOSS WEAPONS
[6:43:26] <Teras_ode> VoHiYo Yatta!
[6:43:26] <subjectg> @ensign_epic it doesn‚Äôt, but lighter armor usually means less poise is i think the idea
[6:43:28] <%ronin19xx> Man, this is a long ass session bro...
[6:43:29] <Gragnack> truly horrifying outfit on display, like i would just fall over and die if this set of armor came to fight me
[6:43:36] <%RickyRelucent> @seydaq sadly this isnt dks2
[6:43:41] <+Reverend_Roscoe> is this where the guardians are?
[6:43:42] <glass_marcus> Reggie won't stop until every girl in this game is dead
[6:43:44] <%RickyRelucent> for that reason alone
[6:43:49] <%diathex> You wouldn't feel that sorrow if you stepped in a Sif poop.
[6:43:55] <Duskendawn> Hype session though, time flew by
[6:44:01] <Lefteron> HAiL HYDRA!
[6:44:05] <%Ensign_Epic> @subjectg artorias armor isn't really all that light though
[6:44:05] <%counterfeitgimmicks> 24 hour stream? PogChamp
[6:44:12] <%ronin19xx> @Duskendawn Yeah well its like 4 AM here XD

[6:44:21] <%pennykettle_> Skibadee Skibadanger, I am the rearranger
[6:44:23] <+CrantoPSS> HAI HYDRA!
[6:44:24] <%linSP> you could skip gargoyles and kill hydra with some firebombs and do a quick sif kill at sl 1
[6:44:25] <Teras_ode> @Gragnack truly, almost like the 'Havel Mom' build, except for the chest piece and weapon
[6:44:26] <%waltzqueen> BOSS WEAPONS

[6:45:57] <%holydeviant1> A lab lord
[6:46:03] <youngking_kush> This shaping up to be one of my favorite Dark Souls LPs
[6:46:05] <%pennykettle_> down

[6:47:16] <%RickyRelucent> git gud scrub
[6:47:23] <Treasure_Vault> You're gonna get bodied for a while. Takes work to git gud.
[6:47:27] <Monkeyweed21> Reggie can beat ANY level 8 cpu guys
[6:47:29] <%baka_sugoi> P A R R Y Kappa
[6:47:31] <Afrosamasenpai> You did your best and that's what matters
[6:47:35] <Teras_ode> he didn't run into 'The Legend' in the forrest, did he?
[6:47:35] <%seydaq> enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic level up
[6:47:37] <gespenstkick> pvp is a different game
[6:47:41] <%Ensign_Epic> sounds like someone's still on MR. DICKWRAITH'S WILD RIDE
[6:47:45] <Johannen> Mr Darkwraith was legit)
[6:47:46] <%townzzzzz> fight with your heart
[6:47:47] <%holydeviant1> "Why do people keep backstabbing me!?"
[6:47:49] <%diathex> Good shit.
[6:47:50] <%linSP> woolie on the trigger
[6:47:50] <%Cozy90> i think most of them didnt know who reggie is
[6:47:52] <%Ensign_Epic> NYEHEHEHEH
[6:47:57] <%holydeviant1> "Because it's easy. And it does a lotta damage."
[6:47:57] <slackerunchained> "Get Into Dark Souls: FOR GLORY!"
[6:47:58] <Duskendawn> I'm glad nobody dropped OP gear in that invasion
[6:48:04] <gespenstkick> Backstabber 2008
[6:48:11] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I suspect those "failures to connect" may have been Watchdog automatically booting those kinds of people.
[6:48:16] <rasamune> That was hilarious when Mr Dickwraith tried to come back as a Sunbro
[6:48:25] <%seydaq> good ol aiden pierce at the ready
[6:48:26] <%BinaryFireball> they never patched it
[6:48:29] <%BinaryFireball> jesus
[6:48:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> perfect
[6:48:36] <%linSP> i aint touching that shit bro
[6:48:36] <Duskendawn> @a_german_spy Oh makes sense
[6:48:39] <%Ensign_Epic> @rasamune somebody went out of their way to use me for a gank
[6:48:45] <%Ensign_Epic> it was really annoying
[6:48:49] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Because Watchdog DOES scan for that stuff.
[6:48:49] <Duskendawn> Good job watch dog
[6:48:53] <%funya_rinpa> blast you with magic that bans you from the game, lol
[6:48:54] <%BinaryFireball> RL patches want to mess you up
[6:48:56] <+Jiggisnipe> better than nothiing
[6:49:02] <rasamune> Dang
[6:49:04] <%seydaq> plagueFace
[6:49:06] <%CodenameChaz> Definitely will be a problem with Dark Souls 3, which apparently has a fuckin' problem with people being able to run malicious code
[6:49:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Invade to drop off a 99 stack of dung
[6:49:10] <%holydeviant1> Reggie literally did "This is too easy!" to the PvP community
[6:49:11] <Monkeyweed21> in DS2 cheaters can teleport to the hub and start killing NPCs its wild
[6:49:19] <+Silius_Spacebees> Have you done guided playthroughs in gamedev before?
[6:49:21] <%jinking79> 80 hours gone from one Hacked item forced on u
[6:49:22] <%holydeviant1> "I'm sorry. Is this too easy for you?"
[6:49:47] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> DS3 has the "Blue Sentinel" Mod, which basically does the same
[6:50:09] <Tempmael> reggarth already got endgame shit
[6:50:14] <+pectusumbra> Will show the special thing later then?
[6:50:21] <Duskendawn> I've invaded in anor before and got the host to aggro the giant smith, still feel bad about it LUL
[6:50:22] <%Ensign_Epic> honest question, did anyone clip the succ?
[6:50:32] <tetrabrick1lt> LULU
[6:50:33] <Jaysky> BIG. SWORD. WOLF.
[6:50:35] <%CodenameChaz> @HloyDerWurstverkaufer Doesn't Bamco Softban people for modding DS3?
[6:50:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Who needs Poppy
[6:50:37] <%holydeviant1> @pectusumbra probably post DLC
[6:50:38] <%jinking79> pokemon had to steal that design LUL
[6:50:46] <%RickyRelucent> with a sword
[6:50:54] <@Solidus_113> look at this fucking figure of Sif https://www.first4figures.com/the-great-grey-wolf-sif-exclusive.html#&gid=1&pid=1
[6:50:57] <slackerunchained> Good *reach* tho.
[6:50:58] <%livlinn> shiaCry
[6:50:58] <Drusain> I'm sure he'll show it on his phone
[6:51:00] <%holydeviant1> (need the context, after all)
[6:51:05] <+pectusumbra> Soul of the Blood of the Wolf
[6:51:09] <%funya_rinpa> Yeah, he'll probably wait for DLC
[6:51:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> @pectusumbra of the Demon
[6:51:22] <slackerunchained> Soul of the Blood of the Soul of the Wolf. :P
[6:51:26] <tetrabrick1lt> @Solidus_113 GOD DAMN
[6:51:29] <youngking_kush> Soul of the Blood of the Wolf of the Dark Soul lmao
[6:51:33] <+king_of_mystery2> Go find a video for him now Woolie
[6:51:35] <+vaderxyz1970> @Solidus_113 Thats nice
[6:51:42] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> @CodenameChaz It does not change your game files. I have it and was never banned. The author states that he is not aware of bans because of the mod
[6:51:50] <Johannen> Sorry for the headache
[6:52:13] <rasamune> Yeah there is a lot of convoluted shit past the halfway mark
[6:52:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1465556863949357058?t=vTY0O4ob-x0PxHn39K9_yQ&s=19
[6:52:16] <%CaptainBeird> sorry for the headache woolz! i feel i contributed to that
[6:52:18] <%CodenameChaz> @HloyDerWurstverkaufer Fair enough. I just remember it being an issue where they cracked down on any modding
[6:52:28] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[6:52:37] <%A_German_spy> You're welcome
[6:52:39] <youngking_kush> You're doing GREAT for a person who admittedly isnt incredibly well versed on Souls
[6:52:59] <subjectg> We‚Äôre just men in Way of White, livin in an Undead paradise
[6:53:02] <Johannen> Catchpole did great)
[6:53:02] <Duskendawn> But needed 4 runs for sif Kappa
[6:53:14] <%Ensign_Epic> Reggie is just good at Dark Souls, no lies.
[6:53:27] <%seydaq> @Solidus_113 stupid artist eyes, all i see are the blemishes NotLikeThis
[6:53:38] <HloyDerWurstverkaufer> @CodenameChaz as I understand it, it checks if other players are "sus" and then just disconnects you from the session
[6:53:38] <rasamune> That double spin is her hardest move to deal with by far
[6:53:46] <T_Sasquatch> He plays fighting games Kappa , darksouls is easy
[6:53:51] <Duskendawn> Reggie is made for bloodborne I'm telling ya
[6:54:06] <gitdweezzy> can  reggie watch plague's darks souls lore video?
[6:54:11] <%Prevot> reggie will walk all over bloodborne
[6:54:11] <%waltzqueen> I can't wait for ReggieBorne
[6:54:11] <Gragnack> sif is the classic glass canon
[6:54:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Duskendawn He's gonna kill it
[6:54:15] <%ronin19xx> @Duskendawn Oh man thats gonna be a treat
[6:54:23] <Drusain> Yeah I can tell Reggie will crush Bloodborne
[6:54:42] <+pectusumbra> I do think Reggie will actually suffer panic in person from some of the designs and choke though
[6:54:43] <Duskendawn> First try gaskwang calling it now
[6:54:44] <%Prevot> if reggie parries this good in bloodborne he's never gonna die once
[6:54:46] <%ronin19xx> We are gonna have to trudge through DS 2
[6:54:47] <%waltzqueen> @WoolieVersus REggie you're gonna crush BB I believe in you

[6:59:34] <Teras_ode> blue phantoms rarely have pvp experience through the "normal" way so they are usually easy pickings for late game players who have done plenty of "red phantom" invasions

[7:07:17] <Teras_ode> almost everything in Anor Londo is an illusion casted by Gwyndolyn (except the blacksmith and firekeeper), note that the silver knighs have very different hit/bleed effects to the black knights

[7:08:56] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Not Priscila but Gwynewere
[7:08:57] <%Ensign_Epic> I don't think that's accurate to what happened
[7:09:01] <+Jiggisnipe> no
[7:09:04] <slackerunchained> Hell. Joining the forest covenant counts as Sin, for some reason.
[7:09:06] <%baka_sugoi> god is mad at reggie LUL
[7:09:07] <%hax_metatron> Killing Gwyndolin 100% counts
[7:09:09] <$oflooofy> she litterally gives you a choice to leave so yeah youre at fault there LUL
[7:09:10] <%seydaq> 4 sins
[7:09:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> unremovable sin
[7:09:13] <%Ensign_Epic> I like I'm almost certain that is not what happened this stream
[7:09:13] <Lefteron> Go confes
[7:09:13] <subjectg> You can get invaded by multiple forestbros
[7:09:24] <%ekodrop> perma sin
[7:09:24] <Teras_ode> killing non-hostile npcs counts for sin, no?
[7:09:26] <%Irridium> I thought darkening Anor Londo sinned you up real high
[7:09:27] <gespenstkick> Sins are janky
[7:09:29] <Gragnack> yeah killing gwyndolin is i believe a permanent sin point
[7:09:30] <%Ensign_Epic> more likely than not yes it was just multiple Forest hunters
[7:09:35] <Lefteron> Forest bros are the gangsquad
[7:09:41] <Gragnack> no forgiveness for that one
[7:09:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> killing gwyndolin is a permanent sin
[7:09:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good sesh good sesh
[7:09:50] <PMda2nd> bars is back
[7:09:53] <Duskendawn> @irridium Yeah I recall getting my first sin that way
[7:09:59] <slackerunchained> Sin is super-jank and not terribly evenly-implemented.
[7:10:06] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah in theory I believe Reggie's in a permanent sin state now
[7:10:09] <+Mrbaconator> i will be on december 9th\
