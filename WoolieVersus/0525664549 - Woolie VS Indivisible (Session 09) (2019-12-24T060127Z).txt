[0:09:23] <Lenmutt> naw man Monopoly is great when you play with a group and you get slum lords and back hand dealings going
[0:09:25] <fist_wizard_jay> but
[0:09:33] <fist_wizard_jay> what about KOMBAT KART
[0:09:37] <Graxe_> Risk, when
[0:09:40] <+dosan121> you have uno, it came free with your fucking xbox
[0:09:49] <%augusm> augusm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! The saltiest game of all is Monopoly. Can turn a British household into a Chelsea brick fight

[0:14:06] <@SoushinSen> The rules of this battle if SET
[0:14:08] <+Veraverse> Wish Minh was here
[0:14:15] <JDebss> What board game is the worst for colourblind people?
[0:14:19] <+Reaverund> Hola boyoz
[0:14:27] <fist_wizard_jay> other than Uno? no clue
[0:14:28] <Lenmutt> One time i switched fortnight to various colour blind modes for a colour blind friend foudn the one best for them but it was painful for my eyes to watch
[0:14:29] <+l33t_j4gu4r> does a ugly red green holiday sweater just look like a regular one to minh?
[0:14:34] <kirketorp> whaddabout the other colours tho

[0:15:18] <derap41> Play monopoly with inheritance its so fucked
[0:15:27] <Prevot> Monopoly sucks ass
[0:15:32] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie VS Twister
[0:15:34] <%Lion_kun> Mario Party
[0:15:36] <JDebss> Put Twister on the table and get goin.
[0:15:38] <+rosemaryplush> shots fired!!
[0:15:41] <kirketorp> unless you're winning
[0:15:41] <SvenHolgersson> FUCK MONOPOLY
[0:15:44] <Mendin> Nobody ever plays Monopoly right
[0:15:47] <masterpiecejeremy> no joke. Minh recked me at Monopoly and it was such a good move on his part I wasn't even mad
[0:15:55] <JDebss> I like momopoly
[0:15:56] <+l33t_j4gu4r> just like real capitalism lol
[0:16:05] <derap41> Yes its a bad game its unbalanced and has random elements that lets players reach unbeatable level
[0:16:07] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus play Diplomacy
[0:16:08] <+rosemaryplush> remember kids: say no to capitalism
[0:16:12] <Lenmutt> how long would a Risk stream be?
[0:16:14] <joshua_42> Monopoly: Socialism!
[0:16:18] <SvenHolgersson> Monopoly is less fun Life
[0:16:19] <DrkJP520> I've never played monopoly and I'm not 100% sure how it works
[0:16:22] <+Javaa01> A round of UNO is like 5-7 minutes, it's a quick game
[0:16:23] <lvl46palladium> The binding of isaac: four souls can cause some salt if people know how to play the game
[0:16:25] <SvenHolgersson> Which is kida ironic?
[0:16:26] <kirketorp> monopoly was created when the boomers were kids... explains a lot dont it?
[0:16:32] <fist_wizard_jay> the whole night will be scheming
[0:16:42] <fist_wizard_jay> instead of pop offa
[0:16:44] <+rosemaryplush> get that monopoly millenial version!!
[0:16:45] <fist_wizard_jay> offs*
[0:16:54] <derap41> The Dark Souls Board game was pretty good
[0:16:54] <JDebss> big$$$ though
[0:16:55] <SvenHolgersson> @Javaa01 Or we could get a sequel to The Uno Movie
[0:17:00] <spelunkram2> sheriff of Nottingham
[0:17:03] <GundamF91> Bloodborne board game
[0:17:03] <greenduck64> house on the hill pretty fun
[0:17:11] <JDebss> Play the Dark Souls board game!
[0:17:13] <masterpiecejeremy> played Monopoly Cheaters edition once and a guy won by stealing the entire bank while no one was looking
[0:17:15] <Lenmutt> kickboard streams? like Kickstarter board game be the main focus
[0:17:20] <SvenHolgersson> Get into Boardgames sounds awesome
[0:17:26] <Mendin> @WoolieVersus Risk Legacy has shorter games and is effectively a built-in campaign
[0:17:28] <WanderingSwordsman> Goblin Slayer boardgame
[0:17:29] <+spodebroker> so are they playing Mario & Sonic or Indivisible?
[0:17:31] <zamzoph> pretty sure there are for Monopoloy
[0:17:33] <derap41> Its 100% luck based
[0:17:37] <+Maxthetics> Bro what's your Monopoly elo rank
[0:17:43] <+Javaa01> The world championship of Monopoly is the real estate market
[0:18:00] <+l33t_j4gu4r> greatest board game is called the omega virus
[0:18:07] <+Maxthetics> Also competitive monopoly is just capitalism
[0:18:07] <%Lion_kun> Play mahjong cowards
[0:18:07] <masterpiecejeremy> @woolieversus Game Of Thrones Risk actually brings totally new mechanics like money management, ports and fortress that really change the game
[0:18:07] <+l33t_j4gu4r> had it as a kid
[0:18:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kirketorp
[0:18:15] <%augusm> I'm surprised you guys know what a chelsea brick is
[0:18:22] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus if you don't buy, properties go to auction
[0:18:31] <derap41> You have to move what the dice says
[0:18:37] <%Lion_kun> Mahjong is like 70% luck 30% skill
[0:18:41] <DrkJP520> Remember that there's professional rock-paper-scissor
[0:18:45] <Lenmutt> official rules? ummm i don't think i've ever used those
[0:18:51] <+ZENKENmaster> dope getup woolie
[0:18:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:04] <JDebss> yeah actual monopoly rules are the way to go
[0:19:09] <+l33t_j4gu4r> that speeds the game up a loooooot
[0:19:16] <zamzoph> House rules just end up slowing the game down
[0:19:19] <+Veraverse> Fun fact: You can't stack up +2 cards in UNO, officially
[0:19:21] <lvl46palladium> If you are looking for a good co op board game, Mice and mystics is pretty good in my opinion
[0:19:24] <Mendin> free parking does NOT have money on it ever
[0:19:45] <+l33t_j4gu4r> tabletop simulator!
[0:19:49] <+l33t_j4gu4r> ^_^
[0:19:51] <SpirittiArt> DnD
[0:19:55] <DrkJP520> You should play strip poker
[0:20:01] <derap41> Play warhammer 30k you nerd
[0:20:07] <+Polter_ge1st> Twister
[0:20:08] <derap41> 40K*
[0:20:14] <%jinking79> 8hr a game
[0:20:17] <JDebss> Risk takes too long
[0:20:18] <+Polter_ge1st> GROWN MEN TWISTER
[0:20:20] <Graxe_> Monopoly had official speed rules, too
[0:20:23] <zamzoph> but what about 30k tho?
[0:20:23] <SpirittiArt> Chessboxing
[0:20:23] <SvenHolgersson> Life is wayyyyyyyyyy better than Monopoly
[0:20:32] <JDebss> I vote Twister
[0:20:35] <%TheSniperJoe> Monopoly legit has rules to make the game not last forever but we always ignore them.

[0:20:59] <%ozzrabbit> Raise your hand if you’d send a board game to Woolie if he provided a PO Box.
[0:20:59] <derap41> You should play blood bowl as a board game its awesome
[0:21:00] <+Polter_ge1st> ^^^
[0:21:05] <+steelmorrigan> Settlers of Catan anyone?
[0:21:06] <SpirittiArt> MAHJONG
[0:21:14] <Graxe_> Fast Monopoly has the banker give everyone 3 properties at the start for free at random, for example
[0:21:21] <@SoushinSen> @steelmorrigan o/
[0:21:24] <FoxInABeret> woolieSHOOK
[0:21:25] <+SaintSucc> strip mahjong
[0:21:36] <derap41> A full blood bowl team cost like $300
[0:21:37] <+steelmorrigan> Who wouldn't like to hear Woolie declare "Wood for sheep!"
[0:21:39] <Mendin> does strip mahjong have the riichi round?
[0:21:43] <+BignanasTheGawd> Oh hey it’s that jojo guy
[0:21:47] <Graxe_> Bloodborne tabletop game
[0:21:54] <Graxe_> Or was it the Dark Souls one?
[0:21:58] <Graxe_> Or both>
[0:22:03] <Mendin> Kingdom Death Monster?
[0:22:08] <%jinking79> their BS Dice Rolls online
[0:22:10] <Mendin> (which Woolie I think actually owns)
[0:22:14] <+Veraverse> Sonic and Mario looks weird huh
[0:22:27] <+spodebroker> that's what I'm sayin'
[0:22:52] <Graxe_> Kingdom Death Monster was done on the previous Tablelords episodes in Tabletop Sim
[0:23:19] <%Lion_kun> Is this game almost done?
[0:23:27] <Mendin> Heh he thinks he has maximum traversal
[0:23:31] <+Veraverse> Parkour
[0:23:44] <Mendin> Storyline wise he's near the end, but he hasnt started Sidequest-O-Rama yet
[0:23:46] <%Ancopro> just kanuul and then sidewuests if he's feelin it
[0:24:25] <+Veraverse> The music sounds insane
[0:24:25] <%Lion_kun> Tx
[0:24:30] <derap41> He's so good
[0:24:34] <+bmj614> You can open a spot where you found Yan!!!!
[0:24:37] <Mendin> BIG NUMBER
[0:24:49] <+Veraverse> JESUS CHRIST
[0:24:49] <derap41> What the current hit record?
[0:24:54] <+rosemaryplush> :O
[0:25:06] <JaseAdrift> TOD
[0:25:58] <Mendin> Reset the switch?
[0:25:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[0:26:22] <derap41> Canoodle?
[0:26:49] <+Veraverse> Damn
[0:26:53] <+TopTieramisu> wtf is this perspective?
[0:27:48] <derap41> Ajna "I'm helping"
[0:28:18] <+Veraverse> When you sit with the smart kids, and know nothing about the subject. That's Ajna now
[0:28:26] <Setaro> The enemies have so much hp :o
[0:28:46] <+teddybomber> I hated those tanks
[0:28:53] <derap41> @Setaro it is a tank after all
[0:29:03] <%Ancopro> you can put a big blanket over it
[0:29:17] <%Lion_kun> Woolie thinks this is more fun than Sekiro lol
[0:29:31] <+Veraverse> I guess the real bad ending was the friends we made along the way
[0:29:39] <Mendin> I wonder if it would have been faster to get back into the factory and take the warp gate home
[0:29:43] <JaseAdrift> woolie is weird\
[0:30:02] <%Lion_kun> Enemies are so spongey.
[0:30:19] <derap41> Remember they're all stuck in her brain I think they're trying to stay on her good side
[0:30:20] <%Ancopro> except Razmi who has been consistent the whole way
[0:30:44] <Mendin> Razmi has been an enaber the entire time though
[0:30:45] <+Matt_Made> Where we at in the story?
[0:30:53] <%Lion_kun> Endgame
[0:30:53] <Mendin> 2/3 revists complete
[0:30:59] <+Matt_Made> Ah.
[0:31:08] <+Matt_Made> The fun stuff
[0:31:09] <%ozzrabbit> Mostly because Razmi burned down her own house.
[0:31:09] <Yukai_Yami> You’re giving the dialogue too much credit...
[0:31:16] <+Veraverse> "I won't piss off my home"
[0:31:20] <derap41> @Matt_Made you know when the hero is at their lowest and the feel like they've failed yeah that part
[0:31:21] <JaseAdrift> way to much credit
[0:31:28] <Mendin> She burned down her own house because there were enemy soldiers in it
[0:31:29] <+TopTieramisu> "PEACE"
[0:32:06] <%Ancopro> try it on enemies
[0:32:12] <%Lion_kun> Isn't the protag like some huge hypocrite?
[0:32:13] <+Matt_Made> Juggle enemies
[0:32:28] <Mendin> the protag is a Furious Dumbass
[0:32:42] <derap41> The Protag is Naruto but worse
[0:32:46] <iggeh> @Lion_kun she does some bad things, and in a span of 3 minutes realizes it, comes to terms with her mistakes and moves on to fixing them
[0:32:59] <@Menitta> I haven't been following the LP and I dropped the game. What...exactly does she do
[0:33:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:33:17] <+Matt_Made> She is dumb and i kinda blame her dad
[0:33:32] <derap41> @Menitta tries to do good fucks up and does bad because she's dumb
[0:34:11] <%Lion_kun> At least that guy who killed her dad had an arc whetr he tried to atone for his sins
[0:34:16] <+HugsTheGreat> 16 year old girl should be listened to
[0:34:35] <derap41> its a bit like in DnD where the DM has to keep the plot going so everytime the players save the world they actually doom it worse.
[0:34:48] <caninedog1998> omg I remember when Etika asked ppl to support this game when it was on kickstarter :( he really wanted to try this game someday.....
[0:34:53] <derap41> Like Harmon Quest
[0:35:03] <@Menitta> Is it like "I accidentally unleashed unstoppable evil again"
[0:35:07] <JaseAdrift> ajna's the one bad player on the dnd team
[0:35:26] <+Matt_Made> @Menitta Kinda.
[0:35:41] <derap41> @Menitta More like I fucked this city up worse trying to stop this evil I unleased
[0:35:51] <Mendin> It's the wrench moles from SMB3
[0:36:05] <%Lion_kun> I want trigger to make a little witch academia season 2
[0:36:06] <+Veraverse> Basically, it's some Spec Ops The Line shit
[0:36:24] <derap41> @veraverse You think you're the hero of this story?
[0:36:34] <Mendin> Did you lose the ringsel from htiting the spikes?
[0:36:49] <+TopTieramisu> that's a long spatula
[0:37:26] <derap41> Is sounds like you'rer saying Canoodle
[0:37:54] <+Veraverse> Super Jump Party
[0:38:01] <+Matt_Made> High jumpers only
[0:38:28] <+Veraverse> Getting so high, in all ways possible
[0:38:43] <%Ancopro> your holding up
[0:39:08] <Mendin> Maybe do the curve-dash first then th e high jump?
[0:39:41] <+TopTieramisu> welp
[0:39:43] <derap41> This is some Getting over it shit
[0:39:52] <+Matt_Made> Oh he doesnt have the true platforming traversal
[0:39:52] <+Veraverse> Getting Over with Woolie Woolz
[0:40:27] <Mendin> Woolie suddenly has to puke into his shirt
[0:40:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:40:48] <+Veraverse> Plot twist: Woolie is with a purse by his side
[0:40:48] <iggeh> @Mendin it's the safest option after all
[0:41:03] <@Menitta> @woolieversus Btw, you never uploaded this week's schedule
[0:41:05] <Mendin> It's red-bull-proof
[0:41:06] <derap41> Unless you have a hat
[0:41:24] <Kaito_Cam> Perrrrrrrrsooonnaaaaa
[0:42:29] <+Veraverse> Scientifically testing the puke shirt, I see
[0:43:11] <derap41> woolieSHOOK

[0:44:21] <$jehovas_thicknesss> Cheer500
[0:44:22] <$jehovas_thicknesss> jehovas_thicknesss's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[0:44:26] <+Veraverse> Getting Over it With Woolievs
[0:44:54] <+gustavozxd> I haven't played this game but I get the feeling Woolie makes the platforming way harder than it is somehow
[0:45:03] <%Ancopro> you miiiiight need another ability
[0:45:38] <+Veraverse> I'm starting to miss that Ubisoft Metroidvania
[0:45:39] <+TopTieramisu> the nooch axe
[0:45:43] <+Veraverse> I forgot the name
[0:45:46] <Mendin> So there's Big Irony for people who know the game
[0:45:52] <+gustavozxd> child of light ?
[0:45:52] <+Polter_ge1st> Nooch Axe
[0:46:12] <+Veraverse> No, it was one truly focused on plataforming
[0:46:17] <%Ancopro> you could try going on the roof to the right
[0:46:33] <%Ancopro> oho
[0:46:34] <%Lion_kun> I feel this is the unintended method
[0:46:43] <derap41> Didn't even need the axe
[0:46:44] <+gustavozxd> now I'm curious
[0:46:51] <+therabbles> sequence break boys
[0:47:05] <+Veraverse> Outland!
[0:47:12] <+Veraverse> It was Outland
[0:47:14] <+gustavozxd> yeah I was about to say, Outland
[0:47:22] <+gustavozxd> never heard of it
[0:47:38] <+Veraverse> Never finished it, the final boss was a shitshow
[0:47:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19

[0:50:41] <derap41> You sure you can't axe after spear jumping

[1:04:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeah that will take a while
[1:05:08] <%jinking79> hard whiff
[1:05:23] <Mendin> There's at least three sidequests I want Woolie to do: Ren's, Phoebe's, and Gun Man's

[1:25:48] <%Lion_kun> RiP Dhar
[1:25:54] <Mendin> Reggie has the wisdom of the falcon
[1:26:09] <derap41> Some members add stuff sometimes
[1:26:09] <joshua_42> Poor Dhar he didn’t he deserve what happened to him
[1:26:11] <RDMOOSE> It all makes sense now! SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[1:26:16] <JaseAdrift> what happened to all the guy characters...oh wait
[1:26:19] <Mendin> Talk to people in your head to get sidequests
[1:26:22] <%Ancopro> dha not even a memory
[1:26:23] <+Matt_Made> @joshua_42 He kinda did
[1:26:28] <+therabbles> the smell of dead dhar
[1:26:31] <derap41> Dhar wasn't wrong he was just an asshole
[1:26:37] <%Lion_kun> Someone whisper to me if Dhar is dead for real please.
[1:26:46] <+Superbro64> did everyone forget about dhar of
[1:26:47] <+Matt_Made> He was totally wrong. He attacked villages for no good reason
[1:26:53] <+Superbro64> or something?
[1:26:55] <arkv01> sumfin fishy
[1:27:03] <joshua_42> I guess so
[1:27:11] <derap41> Dhar attacked that village to save the world
[1:27:17] <joshua_42> Everyone has forgotten about Dhar
[1:27:25] <iggeh> Dhar was saving the world from Ajna
[1:27:28] <JaseAdrift> who's dhar
[1:27:28] <%Lion_kun> Dhar did nothing wrong.
[1:27:36] <Mendin> Get Hunoch's
[1:27:38] <+Sendaar> #fuckAnja
[1:27:39] <Mendin> While you're here too
[1:27:40] <+Matt_Made> Nah he got what was coming to him
[1:27:46] <%Ancopro> dhar's a weird way to pronounce bar
[1:27:46] <derap41> Just fug already
[1:27:48] <+therabbles> if Dhar was so smart how come he's dead Kappa
[1:27:49] <+Matt_Made> Tricked or not
[1:27:50] <%jinking79> everyone that burn Ajna Village r dead
[1:28:02] <Mendin> Tsitsi isnt her sister
[1:28:07] <joshua_42> If Dhar was so good why isn’t there Dhar 2
[1:28:08] <%Ancopro> the sister is by the chakra gate
[1:28:09] <thegreatbambe> this is some dom sub shit eradicating off of them
[1:28:10] <%ozzrabbit> Other sister
[1:28:16] <arkv01> my queen I am ready to serve Kreygasm
[1:28:44] <Yukai_Yami> Isn’t her sister someone else..?
[1:28:59] <masterpiecejeremy> Queen, dont stomp on your enemies. they'll enjoy it too much!
[1:29:06] <derap41> Ajna turn around dumbass
[1:29:17] <%Lion_kun> I feel there's something off with a story's writing when a character dies and you barely remember it happened. It doesn't help this game has like a billion side characters.
[1:29:44] <EndgameContent> I wonder when Woolie will learn how to juggle
[1:29:52] <EndgameContent> And notice how it gives a lot more meter
[1:29:53] <+Matt_Made> @Lion_kun Like when Rhavannavar died?
[1:30:04] <arkv01> @EndgameContent when he learns to DODGE THIS
[1:30:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[1:30:11] <%Lion_kun> Who?
[1:30:16] <masterpiecejeremy> Woolie already learned to juggled fracture friendships @endgamecontent
[1:30:16] <joshua_42> Oh my god he did die right?
[1:30:17] <EndgameContent> The game gets so much more fun once enemies stop hitting the ground.
[1:30:17] <+Matt_Made> Exactly!
[1:30:19] <derap41> XD
[1:30:39] <EndgameContent> @masterpiecejeremy :(

[1:31:19] <masterpiecejeremy> woolieS woolieT woolieF woolieU
[1:31:23] <%ozzrabbit> Talk to the other sister that’s back with the rest of the villagers
[1:31:23] <+therabbles> smells like lie
[1:31:24] <joshua_42> What was Rhavannavar’s deal again?
[1:31:41] <plushysceptile> Yeah, why did he attack all the villages and that?
[1:32:03] <%Ancopro> rhavanavar just wanted to wake up kala but he only had weak boys on his team
[1:32:11] <derap41> @joshua_42 wanted to wake Kala to make the world perfect killed that village because it was litterally just tehre
[1:32:23] <%Lion_kun> Wait when and how did he die? I've been watching this lp from the beginning and I didn't even notice he died lol
[1:32:31] <derap41> Kala killed him
[1:32:41] <Yukai_Yami> I feel the 3 big cities need more warp points than just the chakra gate. Especially if you can’t run from battles
[1:32:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> he wanted to get enough idhi so he would stay the same as an imortal parasite in Kala's cycles of death and reincarnations
[1:32:55] <%Lion_kun> So much for being the final boss.
[1:33:06] <plushysceptile> He got got after the airship got destroyed
[1:33:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> he died in the Sumaru mountains when Ajna ended up awaken Kala
[1:33:55] <derap41> And now Anja is fixing a bunch of stuff she ruined in order to fight Kala
[1:34:27] <derap41> That's a well fed baby
[1:34:40] <+therabbles> that baby is 50% skull

[1:48:41] <%drefizz> is that a kamn rider
[1:48:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> so basically this is Dark Souls 1 if you got the right of rekindling sooner then the short cuts/physical connections
[1:49:07] <joshua_42> Naga Rider is the best character in this entire game
[1:49:07] <zenith0111> I WANT TO BE A RIDER
[1:49:14] <Yukai_Yami> Naga’s color 4 is cool, but the Guren color is better...

[1:55:00] <Prevot> what
[1:55:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> eh i made a terrible joke
[1:56:07] <derap41> So the smasher is just another meth addict
[1:56:26] <thegreatbambe> guttural screaming from woolie is the best
[1:56:30] <gunsrlove> Always gotta smash
[1:56:47] <derap41> This isn't Smash this a bum beat down
[1:56:51] <morcego_cinzento_arts> No unique sprites for this side quest. At least they got that portion right for an rpg mechanic
[1:57:00] <Yukai_Yami> I mean, he could’ve been indoors when it rained...
[1:57:14] <derap41> Sprinkle some crack on him and lets get out of here
[1:57:34] <gunsrlove> You will never Smash again villain
[1:57:40] <gunsrlove> Go take a shower

[1:58:07] <derap41> Looks like a smash player
[1:58:13] <Yukai_Yami> That’s some strong water
[1:58:16] <+Story_Ark> just pour some bath water
[1:58:21] <Prevot> probably still stinks
[1:58:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Damn Thorani's water healing is so good that it fixed this recoloured enemy into an unique design
[1:58:41] <derap41> yay forced labor

[2:04:42] <WanderingSwordsman> "It is what it is"
[2:05:03] <+therabbles> the fact that it was a side mission does that mean Ajna had no intention of helping otherwise

[3:28:25] <@Solidus_113> Now to take a week break and completely forget who you picked up
[3:28:33] <Dusty_Catz> When they get back to the house, I want the most casual ever bomb drop that dad died
[3:29:00] <Dusty_Catz> "Hey, where's dad"? "Oh, he died. Would you like a snack"?
[3:29:11] <AxelCezar> projChins projChins

[3:31:29] <gunsrlove> Stream is a terrible thing as a background to work out

[3:32:05] <DatAsuna> @gunsrlove how so? :o
[3:32:20] <gunsrlove> how so on what
[3:32:48] <joshua_42> That sounds really useful
[3:34:41] <gunsrlove> Gym i go to is fairly expensive
[3:34:49] <gunsrlove> but it's also well maintained and clean
[3:34:56] <gunsrlove> which can make a HUGE difference
[3:35:17] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> Volition was my favourite stat in Disco Elysium, reading that 80 dull droning page document about to find that one line useful to the investigation is fucking badass

[3:36:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I just watched the other day a pretty amazing fan made cg animation of one of the cutscenes of Soul Reaver 2....It saddens me that the very last Legacy of Kain thingie is a multiplayer that nobody cared
[3:36:30] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie is Feeding!

[3:37:06] <Dusty_Catz> Gym culture is interesting, in a really bad way
[3:37:07] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I bought a heavy axe to work out with, the weights/dumbells weren't doing it for me
[3:37:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I can only manage to go to the gym like once a week.
[3:37:36] <@Solidus_113> It's fruits first
[3:37:48] <+dmtjinni> There is no gym culture
