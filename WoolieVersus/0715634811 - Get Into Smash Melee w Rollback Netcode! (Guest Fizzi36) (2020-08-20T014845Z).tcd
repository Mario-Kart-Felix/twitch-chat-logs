[0:11:57] <+ManOfReason> whats better than ONE GUY? TWO GUYS
[0:11:58] <JdotSweapA> Juan Gai
[0:12:00] <%ChoculaUltra> literal years of Capcom heads giving every excuse they could find - dude bangs it out in 3 days.
[0:12:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> woolieONEGUY Over Heaven
[0:12:05] <%Dumple_Roe> and the "have we made it" attitude is dangerous to companies denying to adapt

[0:12:27] <%MrAtheGreat> Idk the melee guy here is way cooler imo because melee didn't even HAVE online to begin with!
[0:12:30] <%MrAtheGreat> GODLIKE
[0:12:40] <+ggbhtg> SFV patch didn't actually work equally for everyone, sadly
[0:12:40] <Viewtiful_Rose> We in Reggie territory today boiz
[0:12:42] <$Noponiz> well he cant change code on consoles
[0:12:54] <RunoEddie> I hope to god this man gets scouted
[0:12:55] <sunnythedrunk> @MrAtheGreat Melee did have online, but it was way way worse
[0:13:00] <$Noponiz> if he could edit files on consoles, he could probably do it couldnt he?
[0:13:04] <BlackermanZX> jp dev stubbornness is terrible
[0:13:09] <+jiggy_snipe> messing with consoles is very hard unless every console was hacked
[0:13:16] <%DensityD> is it government built? then it will cost more
[0:13:19] <+ggbhtg> HONORABLE JAPANESE NETCODE must be maintained!

[0:14:06] <%ChoculaUltra> "we could be doing other stuff" is basically game dev speak for "we're not getting paid for it so why bother lol"

[0:16:33] <+ggbhtg> R I P E V O
[0:16:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Same....
[0:16:38] <+jiggy_snipe> I wanted that so badly
[0:16:39] <Solidnick18> That netplay matters
[0:16:41] <Mach5Mike> I wanted that day of reckoning so much....
[0:16:42] <%Irridium> that's what I wanted more than anything else
[0:16:42] <%BisoromiBear> but the future refused to change
[0:16:44] <Solidnick18> yes
[0:16:47] <%ChoculaUltra> @agoaj I spit out my drink LUL
[0:16:47] <%SirGO0SE> it did show the world something more important, unfortunately
[0:16:49] <Solidnick18> Just lagging everywhere
[0:16:52] <BlackermanZX> i was hyped for trashing the horrible netcode in these games
[0:16:53] <+jiggy_snipe> then they picked the 4 games with good netcode like assholes
[0:16:55] <floralkami> it was SOOOOO CLOSE
[0:16:58] <+ggbhtg> Cord pull in GFs
[0:17:01] <%Irridium> that way there's no way they can talk without the garbage being shoved in their faces
[0:17:03] <Solidnick18> then disconnects
[0:17:05] <%Dumple_Roe> SmashUlt did it without EVO'S help
[0:17:07] <Camail> the ultimate snub is "you're game isnt good enough to be at evo"
[0:17:18] <ChansonNoire> cursed skullgirls
[0:17:30] <ShawnEXE> !uptime
[0:17:31] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 28 minutes and 7 seconds
[0:17:31] <@Solidus_113> TFH still got shafted, despite the new eyes on announcement
[0:17:32] <BearSawed> I think everything was impossible to predict
[0:17:36] <+ggbhtg> Skullgirls will never be a real girl.... bizSad
[0:17:39] <BlackermanZX> ...and then one guy killed evo hard
[0:17:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[0:17:57] <%ChoculaUltra> I really, really wanted to get into Granblue but after the first month of online play I went back to the gacha game FeelsBadMan
[0:17:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HELL YEAH Skullgirls is finally being recognized! Wait...Mike, Mike what are you doing? MIKE! NOO!!
[0:18:03] <+ggbhtg> that's more so One Legacy, rather than One Guy
[0:18:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> Thanks McRib
[0:18:04] <+ManOfReason> GUESS WHOS BACK
[0:18:15] <%SirGO0SE> I am Mighty Keef had a FIELD DAY
[0:18:40] <SymphonicMetalCitadel> It's bizarre how invested I am in the netcode situation due to the podcast, despite my having never played fighting games
[0:18:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1287839400034996227?s=20
[0:18:45] <Solidnick18> @SirGO0SE he has amazing videos
[0:18:47] <JdotSweapA> KOF 2002 LUL LUL
[0:18:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice
[0:18:52] <+ManOfReason> oops
[0:18:55] <+ggbhtg> wait what did you
[0:18:56] <BenjiCake> samruai shodown is depressing with its netplay
[0:18:58] <%SirGO0SE> @Solidnick18 boy thats just crazy
[0:19:05] <Camail> thats....sigh
[0:19:05] <ofodojo> I wanted to try Sam sho
[0:19:09] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:19:18] <JdotSweapA> woow
[0:19:18] <%Irridium> didn't DBFZ actually introduce this post launch?
[0:19:18] <Solidnick18> is better then delay
[0:19:19] <+ggbhtg> oh, Sam Sho being trash, got it
[0:19:20] <Camail> remote play is better, smh
[0:19:21] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:19:28] <VJdarkworld> lol
[0:19:33] <%ChoculaUltra> I live exactly 8 literal blocks from my friend who I play DBFZ with on Steam. Both of us have hard ethernet connections - still get 5-6 frame delays occasionally. HOW SWAY.
[0:19:34] <%mike2hands> woolieFUN
[0:19:34] <%Mr_Ease> Still way better than Smash Ultimates... everything
[0:19:35] <+McSoliace> tekken also has that
[0:19:36] <%ChestMimik> I liked the one match in Samsho that took less than 20 minutes to connect, and I can play most games fine. Samsho's weird.
[0:19:40] <wisconsinjoe> Oh jeeeesus that’s bad
[0:19:44] <floralkami> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Mike: what was that? more cringe? you want MORE shitty workplace behavior? okaaaay, don't blame me if you can't breathe under this weight!
[0:19:46] <Solidnick18> i think they said something with parsec and samsho or something
[0:19:54] <%Dumple_Roe> old SamSho collection is using rollback
[0:20:05] <Viewtiful_Rose> I love SamSho 7 but it’s netcode is depressing
[0:20:20] <Zayasu> @Dumple_Roe yes and its still awful
[0:20:24] <DingasKhan> tvc >:)
[0:20:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HD GAMECUBE
[0:20:28] <Viewtiful_Rose> But yes the collection has rollback
[0:20:33] <+ggbhtg> Dolphin is the goat beyond goats
[0:20:37] <Davimotion96> Can this work with the gamecube version of CvS 2?
[0:20:43] <%gatorafan> HD GameCubes are amazing FeelsGoodMan
[0:20:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Dolphin is the best emulator
[0:20:51] <+Fenrein> Dolphin is on another level from every other emulator
[0:21:06] <%MrAtheGreat> BTW Who here wants nintendo to have the gamecube library on switch?
[0:21:11] <+pebblypirate> @WoolieVersus is there any plans on getting music on netplay?
[0:21:14] <+TheBesteban> Oh hi
[0:21:31] <%ChoculaUltra> I remember seeing how to install HD textures into Xenoblade Chronicles with Dolphin and I was a changed man. Dolphin is OP.
[0:21:35] <+ManOfReason> Shoutouts
[0:21:38] <%Wool> @pebblypirate there's already a way to add music to Slippi
[0:21:45] <+pebblypirate> sick
[0:21:47] <+EternalJedi> as far as I know, Dolphin will run literally anything save for ONE game they're still trying to get to work
[0:21:49] <BearSawed> @MrAtheGreat Nah, theyll just sell you the same 75 nes and snes games again
[0:21:54] <+pebblypirate> ill check it out
[0:22:05] <+dieselssb> @eternaljedi is it cel damage?
[0:22:19] <%MrAtheGreat> @BearSawed damn it's true isn't it BibleThump

[0:22:25] <%Irridium> NotLikeThis
[0:22:28] <Nekros4442> That was legit my experience with BBxTag, I couldnt play online so I returned it immediately
[0:22:30] <Camail> then you pres a button.... and wait
[0:22:32] <%ChoculaUltra> Remember when P4G finally hit Steam and killed Vita emulation in literal hours? Crazy shit.
[0:22:33] <+Fenrein> DBFZ
[0:22:33] <%agoaj> Yeah, a bunch of work going into getting rollback into Pocket Fighters EX. Have to throw out a bunch of basic Unity code.
[0:22:40] <Solidnick18> doa5 NotLikeThis
[0:22:42] <@Solidus_113> Cross Tag Battle
[0:22:44] <JdotSweapA> SFV STILL has problems...
[0:22:49] <%Irridium> SamSho for me :(

[0:23:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> Me with P4U woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:23:05] <+ggbhtg> HOW SWAY
[0:23:06] <FreedomKME> Guilty Gear is the saddest one
[0:23:09] <+IronBagel1> I love Centralfiction, but the online is dead, and atrocious
[0:23:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[0:23:10] <VJdarkworld> BibleThump
[0:23:28] <ChansonNoire> anecdotal evidence, but granblue is more than fine if I keep it to montreal... elitist reggie Kappa
[0:23:28] <MattDemers> I forgot Granblue even came out
[0:23:32] <%ChoculaUltra> thats fucking stupid.
[0:23:34] <%Irridium> I pushed through it with DBFZ for a while but... it wore me down man. especially in this covid world
[0:23:45] <%MrAtheGreat> @ChoculaUltra I wonder if any mods were made for P4 emus was just moved over to the pc port and how easy that was
[0:23:48] <BearSawed> Meanwhile KI
[0:23:52] <floralkami> @choculaultra you mean as in people stopped looking for P4G ROMs?
[0:23:55] <ChansonNoire> YO LIGHTNING MODE
[0:23:58] <%ChoculaUltra> @Irridium I know that feel "maybe next match will be better" FeelsBadMan
[0:24:00] <Nekros4442> and this is why we're looking on at the Japanese fighting game roundtable with very very vested interest. I want every company at that table to commit to better online because there is no more alternative.
[0:24:02] <%ElectricEmissary> yooooo
[0:24:21] <+ggbhtg> Tekken 7 has turbo mode special matches with the AI, SO YOU'RE SAYING?....
[0:24:23] <Camail> ooooooh, wild
[0:24:24] <Mach5Mike> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[0:24:27] <%Skullgod> Lightning mode saved Melee PogChamp
[0:24:32] <%ElectricEmissary> SAKURAI INTENDED FOR ROLLBACK CONFIRMED
[0:24:36] <socratetris> careful of smelly thuggery
[0:24:37] <fgcgabe> hey whats up woolie
[0:24:38] <+ManOfReason> 300hz? Lol
[0:24:38] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami a little bit of both, Vita emulation had some hang ups with a couple of games, P4 being one of them. So when the official port hit PC the scene kinda just stopped caring.
[0:24:41] <ChansonNoire> tekken has rollback.. but only 3
[0:24:50] <+IronBagel1> Tekken 7 is 3
[0:24:54] <%gatorafan> What is this science shit I'm hearing? daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:25:04] <%DensityD> m e l e e
[0:25:18] <ChansonNoire> lightning mode is one of the special mode where everything runs at 2.5x ish speed
[0:25:18] <%ChoculaUltra> so its like, the one game everyone wanted emulated can now be bought straight up and it sort of just faded away~
[0:25:20] <+dieselssb> Melee is sick
[0:25:20] <+Fenrein> If smash weren't a party game we wouldn't have rollback PogChamp
[0:25:31] <+spaghetti_shaman> This isn't Persona Arena Q
[0:25:33] <%agoaj> Smash Ultimate only supports 90fps aka 1.5x speed.
[0:25:36] <sunnythedrunk> Lightning mode PogChamp
[0:25:38] <+spaghetti_shaman> I've been bamboozled
[0:25:43] <+dieselssb> @hayasage holy shit PogChamp
[0:25:43] <%ElectricEmissary> lightning mode allows us to play faster than lightning
[0:25:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:25:43] <christopherwpoindexter> I enjoy competitive multiplayer in any genre, I feel and have experienced directly the appeal...but I'm so burned out with Hot Wheels and ToonTown having been shut down (which is more mmo), other games being so blah, and a lack of availability from friends to do local or online in the game I play, I've just become a hard near-100% single player stan, fighting or any game
[0:25:46] <%DensityD> it's just humanly impossible to react to something that comes out in 5 frames Jebaited
[0:25:47] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:25:47] <socratetris> smelly lightning
[0:25:48] <+ggbhtg> SsssTAMINA!
[0:25:48] <$Noponiz> has anyopne actually confirmed the tekken claims? SOunds like poor english skills at work
[0:25:49] <floralkami> @choculaultra ah, thank you. now to just hold my breath for Atlus to port P4AU to Steam with rollback... yep
[0:25:55] <Camail> its a chicken and the egg situation
[0:25:55] <StarkMaximum> Fighting game players move at FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT
[0:25:58] <+ggbhtg> Sakurai was from DA FUTURE
[0:25:58] <%LynbellDaYo> Party games have defeated fighting games
[0:26:00] <Davimotion96> IWATA
[0:26:06] <christopherwpoindexter> *in the games I play,
[0:26:09] <%Dumple_Roe> Blessed Melee
[0:26:12] <%ElectricEmissary> LIGHTNING MODE FOR FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT
[0:26:12] <+ggbhtg> SssTAMINA!
[0:26:13] <Mach5Mike> Sakurai unintentionally made Melee immortal
[0:26:15] <floralkami> @noponiz yes, it's 3
[0:26:38] <christopherwpoindexter> I WASTED SO MANY HOURS just playing Stamina Mode in Melee, no records or stats to show for it 😅
[0:26:38] <%Asuterisuku> Melee was clunky and jank and had problems and that in the end made it beloved for some reason.
[0:26:45] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami it only took them 8 years to get P4G out of the dregs. There's hope FeelsBadMan
[0:26:58] <@Solidus_113> you'll find a bunch of exploits from the most interesting places. Like the recent PS2 hack with the DVD drive
[0:26:58] <%DensityD> they hate the money
[0:27:09] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god I made myself sad, Atlus really does hate money
[0:27:14] <ofodojo> Third strike rollback?? :-)
[0:27:15] <StarkMaximum> @christopherwpoindexter Yo Stamina mode in Smash is HEAVILY underappreciated
[0:27:25] <%ChestMimik> Doesn't switch homebrew hacking involve the joycon charger?
[0:27:29] <%blaccbird914> no more than three though :)
[0:27:29] <ChansonNoire> ofodojo atpCap
[0:27:31] <Aussie_Manny> WHO knows?
[0:27:37] <Aussie_Manny> RIP Locals.
[0:27:41] <Aussie_Manny> For now...
[0:27:42] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:27:44] <%DensityD> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:27:47] <Cymen90> I hope some dev will be brave enough to make a fighting game that is fun and not made for the FGC :)
[0:27:49] <%HostilePoundcakes> HostilePoundcakes subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! I can't believe the zapping system saved Melee Kappa
[0:27:50] <%Skullgod> 3 years if we are lucky tbh
[0:27:51] <BearSawed> or I dont know maybe build a game around it
[0:27:54] <%Irridium> god Smash Ultimate's netcode is awful. probably the worst I personally experienced
[0:27:54] <%ChoculaUltra> Hazmat Suit up for locals LUL
[0:27:55] <+JustToWatch> not until a vaccine
[0:27:57] <+ggbhtg> Fighting Games are SEALED....
[0:27:58] <%DensityD> "if you build it, they will come"
[0:28:02] <Camail> turnout is either gonna be 200% or 50%
[0:28:05] <%DensityD> WE IN THERE
[0:28:06] <Solidnick18> what do you even know what to do after this man
[0:28:09] <DDDorsett> Eww MeLeE
[0:28:15] <DDDorsett> BOP
[0:28:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WE SMASHIN
[0:28:22] <DDDorsett> ouch
[0:28:25] <Solidnick18> BOP
[0:28:30] <+jiggy_snipe> FIghtcade exists for alot of arcade versions of fighting games
[0:28:37] <StarkMaximum> The part that sucks about Melee is there's no characters i like to play, I like big strong unga bunga dudes and both DK and Bowser suck so much ass
[0:28:41] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum thanks for the affirmation fam, that's prob why. I think I just wanted an excuse for traditional fighting game mechanics (HP, not falling off screen) with Mario characters, and liked watching characters *die?* that doesn't sound psychotic or fetish at all 🤣😬
[0:28:44] <StarkMaximum> And they're kind of the only choices
[0:28:44] <TheZearGuy> A real hero
[0:28:46] <%ChoculaUltra> can we get rollback into UMvC3 tho? Asking for a friend :)
[0:28:50] <+ggbhtg> dang, that was plenty of time for me to set this up over here, but I was chatting about how dumb Japan is
[0:28:59] <sunnythedrunk> @StarkMaximum Don't sleep on DK, he's got some sauce
[0:28:59] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Man woolie how do ya set this up?
[0:29:00] <Aussie_Manny> If only they had chosen a game that isn't only 5 characters tho. doodDerp
[0:29:03] <StarkMaximum> @christopherwpoindexter Not "die"! "Get knocked out"! It's different!
[0:29:03] <+ggbhtg> L is REAL, now and forever
[0:29:06] <VJdarkworld> dark souls with rollback is my other dream.......
[0:29:06] <+dieselssb> @starkmaximum what about Ganon?
[0:29:07] <savetitania> The fact that the madman coded an in-game UI for netplay is amazing
[0:29:07] <christopherwpoindexter> but that was 9-ish years ago, too 😛
[0:29:12] <Solidnick18> i only played weegee for the most part
[0:29:16] <StarkMaximum> @dieselssb lol sure
[0:29:20] <+Fenrein> It gets better
[0:29:22] <%ChestMimik> I'd probably get into Melee if they had the Zelda I got used to from Ult
[0:29:28] <%DensityD> Shout Of Earth
[0:29:28] <@Solidus_113> this slick UI
[0:29:28] <floralkami> @choculaultra ngl, the SMT3N announcement has me with a sliver of hope, since it is a more niche title, meaning they ARE looking at their old games and thinking what to do with them. only a little, but better than no hope at all.
[0:29:35] <StarkMaximum> @sunnythedrunk I guess so but I feel like I'm just gonna get combo'd to death forever by Fox and Falco and Marth
[0:29:38] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum exactly, that drew that appeal away, but it was funny seeing them panting and chilling on the ground 😅
[0:29:43] <Mr_Bop> Woolie playing melee? Dang
[0:29:50] <Aussie_Manny> Maaaan, it's a trip seeing such a small roster screen now. LUL
[0:29:52] <%ChestMimik> I just want my Stando powah
[0:29:52] <DragonSpooker> No Terry?
[0:29:55] <ofodojo> @starkmaximum unless you wanna like win tournaments you can def get good enough to play friendlies with dk or ganon
[0:30:04] <JdotSweapA> duude
[0:30:04] <StarkMaximum> Oh my god Online Play literally fits in like it never didn't belong there
[0:30:07] <albobomb> Woah thats amazing
[0:30:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GODLIKE MOD
[0:30:12] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami true that! I'm still kinda in disbelief SMT3N got announced. Like in shock really LUL
[0:30:12] <StarkMaximum> It just looks so natural, like Melee was always onliny
[0:30:13] <sunnythedrunk> @StarkMaximum Watch Rishi vs Kuysashi. Marth is def doable. I feel you on the spacies matchup, you gotta have perfect punish game
[0:30:19] <VJdarkworld> UX time
[0:30:19] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum RIGHT?!?
[0:30:24] <+IronBagel1> Godlike implementation
[0:30:27] <+EternalJedi> so is this Project M? or a separate thing?
[0:30:34] <%Skullgod> its regular melee with rollback
[0:30:36] <%ChoculaUltra> its a separate thing
[0:30:36] <%agoaj> This is Melee in an emulator
[0:30:37] <%Skullgod> and matchmaking
[0:30:39] <Aussie_Manny> Project M is dead, no?
[0:30:41] <Winner_92> Nah this is entirely separate from project M, PM was a mod for brawl
[0:30:42] <Mach5Mike> It looks like the Melee HD that we've always wanted
[0:30:45] <%Asuterisuku> Project M was a Brawl mod, @EternalJedi
[0:30:47] <BearSawed> Project M was a brawl mod
[0:30:47] <StarkMaximum> @ofodojo I guess that's fair tbh, I just struggle to enjoy myself knowing it'd be so much easier to just abandon my preferences and play the good characters that I don't unerstand
[0:30:49] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum "Nintendo live, coming November 31st, 2001" 😎
[0:30:50] <+jiggy_snipe> I wonder if this could be used for Brawl on Dolphin and therefore Project M
[0:30:51] <%DensityD> mintendo tire mhis nan!
[0:30:56] <%ChoculaUltra> is it + or x monkaS
[0:30:57] <Aussie_Manny> 🐬
[0:30:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HIYAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:30:59] <Personified134> defaults to fox LUL
[0:31:02] <+linSP> dolphin is the hd switch right
[0:31:03] <+pebblypirate> @EternalJedi project M is a mod of brawl to make it like melee, this is just melee with netcode
[0:31:04] <Aussie_Manny> FIYAAAAAAAAAA
[0:31:07] <+dieselssb> @eternaljedi pm was a brawl mod. this is some code built into dolphin specifically for melee
[0:31:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LELEELELELELELELEME
[0:31:11] <+EternalJedi> ahhhh
[0:31:13] <+EternalJedi> ty, guys
[0:31:20] <christopherwpoindexter> wait November 31st isn't a real date OOP🤭
[0:31:30] <VJdarkworld> UX so important
[0:31:30] <Aussie_Manny> TO-YAAAH!
[0:31:33] <ofodojo> @starkmaximum I feel you. The top tiers are really good too. I play yoshi and you sorta just lose for a very long time b4 you start winning. With top tiers you can win matches very quickly
[0:31:39] <%DensityD> Hintendo mire nhis tan!

[0:32:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I tried playing but there's only Falco/Fox players LUL
[0:32:26] <StarkMaximum> @ofodojo At least Falcon is always hype, I could pick up Falcon
[0:32:28] <christopherwpoindexter> @choculaultra I blame NakeyJakey for making me aware of those
[0:32:35] <christopherwpoindexter> "blame"

[0:32:50] <ChansonNoire> I played 10matches yesterday to warmup for this and it was like 9 marths
[0:32:54] <Aussie_Manny> SUMMUS
[0:33:01] <%DensityD> CHET
[0:33:05] <ChansonNoire> bro I fucking called it its sheamus
[0:33:10] <VJdarkworld> @ballerswagbro9k i rarely see fox. its mainly falco and marth
[0:33:12] <aquova_> This is such dark magic. It's one thing to think about good UI/UX if you have the source code, but this guy managed to have these sensibilities while hacking a released game
[0:33:13] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus flux looks like it's on
[0:33:17] <doctoroculat> ive been playing this nonstop all week

[0:33:55] <floralkami> @choculaultra Atlus really said "play a REAL SMT game, nerds" *cough*Persona isn't SMT in the first place and should be treated as such *cough* hardcore SMT stans only make it harder for newcomers to feel comfortable to check it out without comparing it to Persona *coughcoughHACK*
[0:33:56] <StarkMaximum> @ggbhtg Yeah I'm aware, I did have to look it up tho just to remember
[0:33:59] <Aussie_Manny> Pound. ;)
[0:34:01] <christopherwpoindexter> I hate that I have main first-party Nintendo GameCube games bought for $20-odd circa 2010 at GameStop, now you can never find them on future console generations or legit old copies without $100 for the mainline mascot entries, now I feel ahead of the curve but also guilty 🤪

[0:36:45] <floralkami> @choculaultra does it really have Dante in it? I've only seen people refer to it, but never seen pics posted (also guessing the joke is why would Persona fans be expected to know or care for DMC)?
[0:36:48] <christopherwpoindexter> exactly, professionals I get they would get tired of it or distracted

[0:52:22] <%MrAtheGreat> Yeahhh Now we looking good
[0:52:25] <+Chronoreyer> there's a 1f window you can hit the shield button to reduce velocity, and it overlaps with the tech lockout so it isn't used often
[0:52:29] <%agoaj> How long until the melee source is decompiled like Mario 64?
[0:52:29] <%ChoculaUltra> he can't put it in the title - it'll throw off his stream titling convention that he's had going for eternity now

[1:08:03] <%DensityD> LIGHT PUNCH!
[1:08:07] <SuperTurboSABER> dont let them play
[1:08:08] <Davimotion96> I really don't know how smash players handle all those weird angles and subtle motions with the sticks. Like, I can do standing 720, Korean Backdash and Electrics on an arcade stick, but man, I can't even fathom doing all that soft movementsin the middle of a fight
[1:08:14] <+ggbhtg> RUN THE STICKS WOOLIE
[1:08:19] <@Solidus_113> There's a wall on the KoF stage
[1:08:21] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus remember to grab the ledge with the grapple hook
[1:08:26] <+ggbhtg> fuck the quarters then, PASS THE STICKS
[1:08:35] <VJdarkworld> falcon on lighting mode on rollback
[1:08:38] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:08:42] <%ChoculaUltra> its all the sensitive tilt moves that get me with Smash. Like how do you guys do it?!
[1:08:44] <bigbrothergannon> that already happens

[1:09:07] <@Solidus_113> you don't get those whiners because that stage would be BANNED
[1:09:11] <ChansonNoire> @ChoculaUltra if youre talking about ultimate, its actually harder to tilt in that game than the other games
[1:09:13] <%ChestMimik> @ChoculaUltra Same way you do every other fighting game input, you eventually just get used to it
[1:09:14] <@Solidus_113> 4Head
[1:09:20] <%DensityD> dash dance more
[1:09:30] <ShawnEXE> the reason why we can do this complicated shit is cause it's mostly all intuitive because its physics based
[1:09:46] <+GalacticaPhanto> Woolie learning Smash is super interesting and I'm all about it
[1:09:49] <ShawnEXE> the reason smash kiddies find fighting game inputs difficult is because it's not intuitive
[1:09:49] <rcand9> reggie redeemed
[1:09:51] <+Archphronimos> NICE WHIPS REGGIE!
[1:09:59] <+Archphronimos> whip*
[1:10:00] <VJdarkworld> @davimotion96 yeh the tricks around it is using buffer system. in melee u can buffer after L cancel for example
[1:10:05] <%DensityD> green samus = woolie
[1:10:17] <ShawnEXE> every move in smash looks like the direction and move you do them in
[1:10:28] <%Struggleful> See me on Jungle Japes tho Kappa
[1:10:31] <Doublemint_Dave_> I’ve been learning melee lately, wish I have gotten in sooner
[1:10:45] <%DensityD> shawn what does that mean
[1:11:06] <+Archphronimos> to anyone who woulud know: is it odd to play Samus with much more emphasis on her ranged attacks?
[1:11:19] <%SirGO0SE> omg
[1:11:23] <%SirGO0SE> is that really what its called
[1:11:25] <ShawnEXE> basically like, why does this command motion look like this. in smash when you see a move you can guess exactly how to do the input even without playing the character
[1:11:32] <rcand9> yo reggie start stylin plz
[1:11:37] <theunclefromnintendo> Every time falcon hits his gentlemen god kisses an angel on the forehead
[1:11:39] <ShawnEXE> but you can't look at a super and assume the input
[1:11:47] <ShawnEXE> or pretzal motions, etc
[1:11:51] <Viewtiful_Rose> Woolie is playing right now
[1:11:51] <+lugraylucid> nice edgeguard there
[1:11:52] <%SirGO0SE> community does what nintendont LUL
[1:11:58] <+GalacticaPhanto> I want to see unchained Reggie style by the end of the night
[1:12:02] <ChansonNoire> damn that starcraft tech LUL
[1:12:16] <%DensityD> okay right, because smash started as an accessible party game

[1:12:26] <nathorz1> k n e e
[1:12:27] <%Asuterisuku> No music is probably good for tournaments, but it's admittedly kind of dull without it for just a fun stream.
[1:12:28] <ShawnEXE> yeah exactly
[1:12:43] <Kalcom> used to
[1:12:53] <%DensityD> there are exceptions to that rule, like grounded link up-B
[1:12:55] <rcand9> go pichu
[1:13:02] <VJdarkworld> the STATS
[1:13:04] <%Wool> @Asuterisuku there's a way to add music to Slippi but Woolie just doesn't know about it
[1:13:12] <Camail> baseball cards

[1:13:15] <christopherwpoindexter> @asuterisuku ^
[1:13:16] <+ggbhtg> uh oh....are they about to....
[1:13:22] <+ggbhtg> cuz I ain't ready just yet
[1:13:24] <ShawnEXE> well even ground link up-b looks like up-b as a recovery
[1:13:26] <anarchistPastry> we BASEBALLIN
[1:13:31] <+GalacticaPhanto> Would using a fight stick be useless in this? or a hitbox?
[1:13:32] <rcand9> someone go pichu tier
[1:13:33] <alephalpha> fizzi gonna carry us to 20xx
[1:13:33] <+Chronoreyer> I giggled when I saw slippi recorded apm when you play and look at the replay
[1:13:49] <Doublemint_Dave_> @galacticaphanto there’s a smash version of a hitbox
[1:13:55] <Mr_Bop> smash had a bit of that yoo
[1:13:56] <%DensityD> and honestly, I always thought ice climbers' neutral special looked like it came from forward special, and vice versa
[1:13:57] <ShawnEXE> there is a hitbox for smash
[1:13:57] <+GalacticaPhanto> oh?
[1:14:08] <Doublemint_Dave_> Smash box I think it’s called
[1:14:11] <Doublemint_Dave_> Or some shit
[1:14:12] <Mr_Bop> Tafokints did that kind of stuff
[1:14:17] <%ChestMimik> Not useless but the benefit isn't as obvious
[1:14:20] <+GalacticaPhanto> I'd have to look into it because I'd be down for that
[1:14:21] <%agoaj> More orange, I thnk I might be getting scurvy
[1:14:35] <ShawnEXE> yeah thats true but the beauty of those moves is that as long as the opponent is in that direction, you'll hit them
[1:14:37] <+LCGOV> is it me or is there a sorta orange hue on the character select screen?

[1:19:49] <GeltonZ> @nxflre Nah, music interferred with netcode
[1:19:53] <+IronBagel1> Playing Guilty Gear without music is like removing half the game
[1:19:54] <Viewtiful_Rose> No for rollback purposes
[1:19:56] <%Asuterisuku> Some good pulls for these turnips.

[1:28:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> PogChamp
[1:28:52] <Louie_Salmon> Yo what the fuck reggie
[1:28:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> DOUBLE KILL
[1:28:54] <rcand9> PogChamp
[1:29:05] <ShawnEXE> honestly in most fighting games you tend to spend more time in the lobby than actually fighting lmao
[1:29:08] <ShawnEXE> it's pretty sad
[1:29:16] <+jiggy_snipe> its almost beta testing
[1:29:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:29:28] <VJdarkworld> mario climbers LUL
[1:29:35] <CorruptDropbear> I think it says a lot when this is better than most other fighting game lobbies
[1:29:35] <%SirGO0SE> thats a loaded question
[1:29:38] <rcand9> loud sweating from reggie
[1:29:42] <+pkmamsters> Reggie's short breaths are good
[1:29:54] <%RyTYoung> I just played Tetris Effect for the first time, and holy shit that is some insanely good shit
[1:29:57] <CorruptDropbear> It's probably a little too dodgy if one person has a bad delay
[1:29:59] <+dieselssb> Mario climbers is too nuts lol I saw that too
[1:30:03] <%agoaj> Double Troubles
[1:30:04] <%DensityD> problematic in 2020
[1:30:16] <%SirGO0SE> rollback may also not work as well with 4
[1:30:25] <%SirGO0SE> too many options
[1:30:29] <anarchistPastry> bro
[1:30:32] <concretenj> doesn't Lethal League have rollback
[1:30:35] <rcand9> yo
[1:30:35] <anarchistPastry> you played CoD?
[1:30:36] <+Rabspat> There's Lethal League
[1:30:43] <sunnythedrunk> FPS use rollback
[1:30:44] <%Irridium> For Honor
[1:30:44] <Davybot> yeah LL
[1:30:44] <%DensityD> lethal league blaze
[1:30:45] <MOON__MIST> brawlhalla
[1:30:49] <%ElectricEmissary> Lethal league blaze
[1:30:52] <Mucmaster> For a roll back with more than 2 you essentailly need a dedicated server
[1:31:04] <+Msytic6> Wouldnt that be kind of ground breaking?
[1:31:16] <+pkmamsters> @RyTYoung playing Tetris Effect during winter nights with headphones and lights off is one of the most mesmerizing experiences
[1:31:28] <rcand9> THIS GAME
[1:31:28] <%SirGO0SE> @sunnythedrunk and the short comings are pretty clear arent they?
[1:31:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:31:36] <rcand9> nice
[1:31:38] <%SilvaChariot0133> YEYEYE
[1:31:38] <ChansonNoire> this falco LUL
[1:31:46] <%SirGO0SE> tons of "i know i hit him" or "he didnt hit me" then getting the opposite on the kill cam
[1:31:50] <VJdarkworld> reggie feelin himself
[1:31:54] <+GalacticaPhanto> Shin Reggie
[1:32:11] <sunnythedrunk> @SirGO0SE Well some are better than others. It's just crazy that Halo 2 had rollback and some fighting games don't have it in 2020
[1:32:13] <rcand9> reggie wake up hello
[1:32:41] <+pkmamsters> Combusting: "shit. I thought i was gonna play woolie. I can't handle KICK DADDY"
[1:32:45] <ShawnEXE> reggie's fox is so rusty
[1:32:46] <%SirGO0SE> halo 2 has a lot of things we dont have in 2020 haha
[1:32:59] <ItsSleepyBoi> wish Kage was there
[1:33:11] <sunnythedrunk> Why Reggie's Samus better than his Fox
[1:33:12] <%ElectricEmissary> nice mangle Reggie
[1:33:14] <+Fenrein> Fox isn't a character you can just jump into without warming up usually
[1:33:15] <JetpackMcQuack> btw emulated gamecubes over a network
[1:33:27] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackHolyPoop
[1:33:30] <ShawnEXE> fox is super technical so you can't just jump on fox
[1:33:46] <rcand9> PogChamp is reggie gonna lose
[1:34:04] <ShawnEXE> maybe something comparable is playing guilty gear and not being able to play baiken
[1:34:06] <ChansonNoire> theres also a good chance combusting knows fox matchup much better
[1:34:09] <%DensityD> Zintendo Zire Zis Zan
[1:34:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> !real
[1:34:14] <ShawnEXE> so you pick potemkin
[1:34:14] <%ElectricEmissary> NINTENDO HIRE THIS MAN
[1:34:14] <VJdarkworld> NINTENDO.... HIIIRE THIS MAN
[1:34:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> Reggie a fake fox confirmed
[1:34:21] <Davybot> more like "whens Air Ride online"
[1:34:35] <ShawnEXE> also yeah fox is usually the training dummy for most players
[1:34:39] <%DensityD> Davybot you reopen my wound
[1:34:39] <+jiggy_snipe> true
[1:34:41] <ShawnEXE> so even though fox is the best
[1:34:43] <%DensityD> it hurts
[1:34:47] <Davybot> haha
[1:34:47] <rcand9> BibleThump
[1:34:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeTHis
[1:34:52] <ShawnEXE> fox is also the most played against
[1:34:54] <%ChestMimik> Please stop hurting me fizzi
[1:34:56] <%ElectricEmissary> BibleThump
[1:34:56] <+pkmamsters> the truth hurts
[1:34:58] <+YabbaTroll> because they want their product to be the best it can be
[1:35:00] <+YabbaTroll> Kappa
[1:35:11] <+jiggy_snipe> Nintendo has more problems than rollback in Ultimate LUL
[1:35:12] <VJdarkworld> BibleThump
[1:35:21] <+jiggy_snipe> like their entire online infrastructure
[1:35:22] <rcand9> reggie goin silent mode
[1:35:23] <SatoruMasamune> Woolie's wasting out time with a dead game while Pat addresses the REAL questions: how much of a milk addict is Captain N's Simon Belmont?
[1:35:23] <%ChestMimik> Ult also has a LOT of other problems, rollback is only one of many
[1:35:33] <%agoaj> Add CPU switchover to Slippi
[1:35:44] <%Irridium> Ultimate's netcode is like the worst with wi-fi too. They have the money to fix it but they just don't care. Shit's infuriating.
[1:36:01] <christopherwpoindexter> NASCAR and Tony Hawk GameCube games on Dolphin nethack rollback when 😆🤪
[1:36:05] <sunnythedrunk> This is probably Sakurai's last smash game
[1:36:16] <VJdarkworld> isnt there something about how ARMS uses some type of rollback system?
[1:36:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:36:17] <ShawnEXE> in it's core smash is primarily a game meant to be played on the couch with a bunch of friends
[1:36:23] <rcand9> NICE
[1:36:26] <+jiggy_snipe> nasty
[1:36:31] <ShawnEXE> and even if those friends don't know how to play smash well
[1:36:33] <+pkmamsters> It's Nintendo and Bandai
[1:36:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL

[1:44:39] <%trustycoyote> @Meltgar I'd give it a try. You'd be surprised. Because even if you are getting hit, you can still make choices.
[1:44:44] <@Solidus_113> Everything you need to learn Killer Instinct you can get from watching Woolie's "GIFG The Lab" for KI
[1:44:45] <sunnythedrunk> Fizzi is all about the oppression session

[1:48:28] <TheLemuroid> Actual 20XX discussion
[1:48:35] <+Chronoreyer> @fangovafang a wavedash is when your character slides across the ground because you airdodge into it at an angle
[1:49:01] <rcand9> let's go meggie
[1:49:01] <Doublemint_Dave_> wavedashing feels better than sex
[1:49:08] <%Skullgod> tru
[1:49:14] <Meltgar> LUL
[1:49:23] <fangovafang> @chronoreyer damn dat sound tough to do NotLikeThis
[1:49:26] <%ElectricEmissary> following up on chrono, it allows for more microspacing options and allows you to grounded attacks like smash attacks while still moving
[1:49:32] <+Chronoreyer> it sounds a lot harder than it actually is
[1:49:35] <+Fenrein> LUL He tried
[1:49:35] <+OroOreo> oh hey he walked up slowly and downsmashed
[1:49:40] <savetitania> wavedashing is way easier than short hop fast fall aerials
[1:49:41] <+Chronoreyer> you just jump and hit the trigger while holding down and forward
[1:49:42] <Doublemint_Dave_> wavedashing comes very naturally
[1:49:53] <savetitania> it's basically a one-two one-two
[1:50:07] <%ElectricEmissary> yeah, shffling is honestly harder than wavedashing
[1:50:16] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie styling
[1:50:23] <Doublemint_Dave_> short hopping is stupid hard in melee compared to ult lol
[1:50:23] <+Chronoreyer> understanding why to wave dash is much much harder than learning how to actually do it
[1:50:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:50:29] <savetitania> for the record, in melee, fox and samus have a 2-frame short-hop window
[1:50:35] <Mucmaster> The first parry is the hardest since you can't react to the Chun-li super
[1:50:42] <savetitania> if you don't press and release within two frames
[1:50:47] <savetitania> you can't short-hop
[1:50:47] <fangovafang> ok 🤔.I'll it next time
[1:50:56] <+Fenrein> Yeah SHFFL actually varies depending on whether you whiff, end in hit stun, or end in shield stun

[2:02:29] <+ggbhtg> I'm getting ducked out here Kappa
[2:02:37] <Spearweaver> DK just wins them no?
[2:02:39] <RastoJJ> Low tiers in this game are boring mostly because low tiers just don't have a lot going on
[2:02:41] <+Fenrein> Zoma's Mewtwo is pretty cool
[2:02:43] <Mucmaster> Low tier marvel characters are super busted stuck in a game where there's even more busted characters
[2:02:44] <+ggbhtg> Not having a pocket everybody DansGame
[2:02:49] <sunnythedrunk> DK and Young link dominate low tier tournament
[2:02:51] <ChansonNoire> low tier tournaments is just link dumping on the other chars
[2:02:58] <+ggbhtg> Huge Kaps here Woolie, don't worry
[2:02:58] <rcand9> dk is barely low tier
[2:03:00] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> marvel 3 has the advantage of the mostly universal magic series
[2:03:03] <%Struggleful> Who's that Juggernaut/BBHood/OmegaRed MVC2 player?

[2:03:16] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Sometimes you need to back out to main menu and into Direct match for it to work
[2:03:18] <RastoJJ> DK is mid tier, don't let people lie to you
[2:03:22] <christopherwpoindexter> AHH
[2:03:25] <+ESP___alex> rip
[2:03:26] <Sir_Dolphinian> soo its been a while since i saw melee... was there always this piss filter over everything?
[2:03:26] <savetitania> The thing with melee is that realistically, if any character had fox hours put into them, you could see them go up in tires
[2:03:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> He’s here noooo
[2:03:31] <%ElectricEmissary> 4 shining Falcos = dk
[2:03:37] <ChansonNoire> @savetitania no

[2:12:19] <christopherwpoindexter> @joylent_blue I thought of saying a random thing like "whisper sweet nothings in woolie's ear" 🤭 NotLikeThis LUL

[2:12:35] <+ESP___alex> the charge!!
[2:12:36] <RunoEddie> I believe in you Skull!
[2:12:39] <+olive_js> @WoolieVersus Who is playing on your end?
[2:12:45] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> slippi melee is my fighting game release of the year. It works. It just works.
[2:12:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> BRING IT BACK
[2:12:52] <%DensityD> "I just want to haaaave priority, whore it out, and get the free damage. I'm tired of Ken"
[2:12:54] <+ggbhtg> both of them @blond_e
[2:12:54] <garrulousAuthority> @Struggleful I've had GBFVX go from four bars to one the moment I click accept
[2:12:55] <joylent_blue> christopherwpoindexter people would be all too willing to do that honestly lytBLUSH
[2:12:55] <rcand9> its over
[2:12:57] <+ggbhtg> currently Reggie
[2:12:58] <garrulousAuthority> It's infuriating
[2:13:00] <fangovafang> im curious y'all,who was good between Fox,Falco,n Wolf?
[2:13:07] <christopherwpoindexter> @blond_e I think Woolz as Samus last time, then Reggie as Fox now
[2:13:13] <%DensityD> space animals
[2:13:21] <ShawnEXE> Uhhhh
[2:13:25] <+ggbhtg> Reverse b-air gimp, he thought about it
[2:13:26] <ShawnEXE> Well wolf isn't in melee
[2:13:27] <Louie_Salmon> But what if you're DeepLeffen, master of bio-weapons?
[2:13:29] <christopherwpoindexter> @joylent_blue 😳😏 Kreygasm
[2:13:32] <%Skullgod> ggs
[2:13:37] <rcand9> gg
[2:13:41] <+ggbhtg> that's 1 1?
[2:13:42] <ShawnEXE> But in ultimate generally people think it's wolf > fox > falco
[2:13:46] <ShawnEXE> but some people thing
[2:13:47] <%DensityD> SALTY RUNBACKS ARE REAL
[2:13:48] <+ggbhtg> 1-1, right?
[2:13:50] <ShawnEXE> wolf > falco > fox
[2:13:54] <ShawnEXE> think*
[2:13:59] <+olive_js> How long is the queue to play?

[2:15:04] <christopherwpoindexter> why not play an FPS inside a Smash match Kappa that sounds too chaotic, my mind is wildin out
[2:15:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fox players=Zero may cry players
[2:15:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Prove me wrong
[2:15:14] <+ggbhtg> I didn't know we had to whisper the code, sorry y'all
[2:15:17] <+olive_js> @WoolieVersus Thanks for covering Melee on this channel. The CSB multiverse seems to hate this game.
[2:15:24] <ShawnEXE> Yeah fox's shine is a set knockback at any percent
[2:15:25] <ChansonNoire> @christopherwpoindexter snake's brawl final smash bro

[2:15:39] <%DensityD> "wave shine"

[2:15:49] <christopherwpoindexter> @chansonnoire YES, DUH, THANK U, I FORGOT ABOUT THAT 😅
[2:15:49] <ShawnEXE> down b -> jump -> airdodge at a near horizontal angle
[2:15:51] <ShawnEXE> repeat
[2:15:56] <LoneFonte> Hey chat, how much did I miss from melee?
[2:16:02] <ShawnEXE> Wavedashing is actually pretty simple
[2:16:09] <+ggbhtg> dang, are we going for chain grabs in a minute?
[2:16:11] <JayPastaForce> Obama chuckled: You mean the waveshine?
[2:16:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie said it is a fighting game
[2:16:12] <+olive_js> Most of Melee's tech is simple if you break it up.
[2:16:22] <%Skullgod> im gettjng toasted
[2:16:24] <Doublemint_Dave_> tech chasing is the best part of smash
[2:16:28] <ChansonNoire> I think there's also that dragoon item that makes the game turn into a raygun simulator
[2:16:28] <%DensityD> woolie wants to read the roll for breakfast
[2:16:32] <ShawnEXE> Yeah tech chasing is great
[2:16:32] <rcand9> WP
[2:16:33] <+Fenrein> Tech chasing is super important in Melee
[2:16:36] <%Skullgod> its so hard to tech chase on netplay
[2:16:36] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Captain Falcon is alllll about the reads
[2:16:38] <%Skullgod> NotLikeThis
[2:16:44] <ShawnEXE> No excuses
[2:16:46] <ShawnEXE> it's rollback
[2:16:48] <ShawnEXE> :)
[2:16:49] <%Wool> NO EXCUSES, IT'S ROLLBACK
[2:16:49] <%ElectricEmissary> the reads toph
[2:16:53] <%ElectricEmissary> the reaaads
[2:16:54] <+olive_js> i techchase pretty reliably on rollback
[2:16:56] <%Skullgod> naw hes better than me
[2:17:02] <christopherwpoindexter> some-us
[2:17:05] <garrulousAuthority> man I wish I liked the gamecube controller at all
[2:17:07] <+ggbhtg> 4 direction rolls, stand up directly, 2 get up kicks, 1 toe tap from the ground, and the spring up kick
[2:17:10] <%Skullgod> i need to play more instead of playing dead games like titanfall
[2:17:15] <christopherwpoindexter> OK announcer
[2:17:18] <ChansonNoire> reggie used to be the best fox player in canada... 15 year ago :)
[2:17:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ppg
[2:17:21] <WumFan64> virtua fighter
[2:17:24] <+ggbhtg> So 9 get up options for Tekken
[2:17:39] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> titanfall FeelsBadMan
[2:17:42] <ShawnEXE> In melee there are 5 get up options
[2:17:55] <ShawnEXE> actually
[2:17:55] <+ggbhtg> Even then, you get different options on the roll themselves
[2:17:57] <ShawnEXE> no I lied
[2:18:06] <ShawnEXE> there is 7 technically
[2:18:07] <+olive_js> @WoolieVersus Can reggie shield-drop? 👀
[2:18:08] <%Skullgod> crouch cancelling is easy, its doing actions out of crouch cancelliing
[2:18:10] <Doublemint_Dave_> I'm learning melee and crouch cancelling is definitely the weirdest thing to be learning
[2:18:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[2:18:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHEN'S THE LUIGI MAINS COMING
[2:18:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> lul
[2:18:25] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> He's Schmoovin!!
[2:18:29] <+olive_js> THis falcon is playing very unsafe
[2:18:31] <christopherwpoindexter> WOW
[2:18:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> i wanna see sliding across the stages
[2:18:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sonofthedeepsouth
[2:18:39] <christopherwpoindexter> the fapton
[2:18:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:18:40] <ShawnEXE> crouch canceling and automatic smash di is probably the most weirdest thing to wrap your head around in melee

[2:18:41] <rcand9> gamer boy falcon

[2:18:44] <%ElectricEmissary> the moonwalk
[2:18:48] <%DensityD> it is, how you say, "sick"
[2:18:48] <%Skullgod> YELL HARDER
[2:18:49] <+ggbhtg> I wish I could agree about that crouch cancel thing, I noticed it back when Melee first came out, with the heavy fighters
[2:18:50] <Doublemint_Dave_> Melee falcon is a thing of fucking art man
[2:18:52] <godzookylives> He is my main in all 5 games
[2:18:57] <JayPastaForce> that falcon is playing F-Zero GX with woolie because he's got a NEED FOR SPEED
[2:19:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Flying knee of death
[2:19:06] <%agoaj> Get the smash ball!
[2:19:08] <%ElectricEmissary> 20GX

[2:19:42] <%DensityD> what tier is mewtwo in?
[2:19:42] <kikoeru_san> stuffed
[2:19:45] <mobiusmartyr> Oof
[2:19:47] <ChansonNoire> bottom
[2:19:49] <%ElectricEmissary> bottom tier
[2:19:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> bottom
[2:19:51] <+olive_js> @DensityD Low/mid teir
[2:19:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> mewtwo in melee sucks
[2:19:57] <ShawnEXE> If woolie ever gets interested in getting good at melee he should try uncle punch
[2:20:00] <rcand9> i wanna see DR Reggie vs this falcon
[2:20:04] <+pkmamsters> this man playin f-zero while woolie's stuck in mario kart 8
[2:20:04] <ShawnEXE> if he doesn't already know about it
[2:20:06] <kikoeru_san> Mewtwo is bad, his entire tail is a hot box
[2:20:15] <ShawnEXE> mewtwo is probably the top of low tier
[2:20:15] <sunnythedrunk> Mewtwo is one of the better low tiers though, he's still bad overall but
[2:20:24] <+ggbhtg> The sex kick, Woolie!
[2:20:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @pkmamsters LUL
[2:20:26] <%Skullgod> everytime you fair, nair instead
[2:20:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> luigi is midtier yeah?
[2:20:37] <%Skullgod> luigi is high mid
[2:20:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah i thought so
[2:20:44] <Spearweaver> m2 is low mid /high low
[2:20:46] <+ggbhtg> It's the sex kick, Wools!
[2:20:54] <ShawnEXE> luigi is high mid
[2:20:59] <rcand9> luigi was always my main but im GARBO
[2:21:02] <%DensityD> woolie needs to see the hitbox for samus nair
[2:21:05] <ShawnEXE> luigi's wavedash is the longest
[2:21:07] <ShawnEXE> it's so silly
[2:21:18] <%Skullgod> you go halfway across the stage with luigi wavedash
[2:21:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> luigi literally slides like it's ice on every stage with his wavedash
[2:21:22] <+ar4ndomblackguy> u see stick fighting videos are back in the form of osu?
[2:21:23] <Spearweaver> luigi is nutty
[2:21:24] <+ggbhtg> Darn, could've edge guarded with her D Smash a while ago
[2:21:27] <%DensityD> "you were cute" ????
[2:21:33] <%halfmasks> ive only played brawl and ultimate, whats the deal with the CRT's for melee and how important is it?
[2:21:40] <ShawnEXE> You can definitely describe luigi as a slippery noodle
[2:21:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PLAY DANCERUSH STARDOM, A REAL RHYTHM GAME
[2:21:48] <+olive_js> @halfmasks Melee requires very low lag to play reliably
[2:21:51] <VJdarkworld> shoulder tackle
[2:21:51] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus N-air has kill potential, too
[2:21:51] <christopherwpoindexter> @halfmasks no input lag?
[2:21:53] <%agoaj> LCDs have extra lag from upscaling the 480p signal
[2:21:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah I’m salt
[2:21:57] <ChansonNoire> jasmin is a very cute man KappaPride
[2:21:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> quebecoirs
[2:22:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> @halfmasks it's the only tv that won't have any lag on the setup
[2:22:06] <ShawnEXE> I think the biggest thing to get used to in melee is the lack of a buffer whatsoever
[2:22:10] <%DensityD> slippi.gg giving that GOOD GOOD stats
[2:22:12] <ShawnEXE> in almost every game there's a buffer
[2:22:20] <ExpressNode> I just now notice the lack of music
[2:22:29] <joylent_blue> lytFIRSTTRY lytFIRSTTRY lytFIRSTTRY
[2:22:29] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Reggie, got anything to say about the difference between damage and knockback potential in this game?

[2:22:50] <+Fenrein> I'm east coast btw. Virginia
[2:22:57] <%halfmasks> theres literally no modern set up that can compare? wow, that must be a nightmare for TO's

[2:23:28] <+ggbhtg> @CaptainPileDriver I got a pocket Green Mario, but I prefer to play Green Mario instead.
[2:23:29] <ChansonNoire> fucking link lol
[2:23:30] <JetpackMcQuack> Constantly changing inputs
[2:23:33] <%DensityD> CANON! PogChamp
[2:23:33] <ShawnEXE> I think sheik can chain grab link lmao

[2:23:54] <ShawnEXE> oh yeah
[2:23:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @ggbhtg i used to main dr mario but i prefer normal mario just for the bit of extra range on his side smash
[2:23:59] <ShawnEXE> sheik can def chain grab
[2:24:00] <+olive_js> shiek can chaingrab most mid/low tiers
[2:24:02] <VJdarkworld> ganon canon
[2:24:15] <+ggbhtg> You may not think Link has tech in this game, but he do
[2:24:18] <rcand9> link must be mid but able to hold his own in top tier right chat?

[2:24:30] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:24:30] <+Chronoreyer> link sucks
[2:24:33] <+ggbhtg> That's Yoshi's Woolie, it happens
[2:24:39] <+ggbhtg> That's the staaage
[2:24:42] <sunnythedrunk> Link can do some work vs top tiers
[2:24:48] <ChansonNoire> @rcand9 kinda, but no
[2:24:50] <+Chronoreyer> he's too slow
[2:24:56] <+ggbhtg> Get hit at the wrong time while doing a down air, that's a wrap
[2:25:06] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> somewhere, Harada-san is getting angry, without knowing why
[2:25:06] <+thackattack00> SFV
[2:25:08] <%DensityD> woolie has said this as well: "rollback will never NOT be good"
[2:25:11] <+Taglog7> UGH, I can't watch this game. Even tho I'm a scrub, I want to play!
[2:25:13] <%Skullgod> link is exactly mid tier
[2:25:16] <+ondri21> tekken wen they fucked it up
[2:25:16] <Zayasu> what about 3d fighting games?
[2:25:17] <sunnythedrunk> Young link just tends to outclass link so not many people play him
[2:25:21] <%Skullgod> like right in the middle
[2:25:26] <+olive_js> link is terrible. defiinitely low tier
[2:25:33] <+Chronoreyer> y link has better specific matchups
[2:25:36] <+Chronoreyer> link is better overall
[2:25:40] <ShawnEXE> rollback's only drawback is more processing power
[2:25:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:25:46] <ShawnEXE> and dev time
[2:25:47] <%Wool> Wool subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Waiting for the day the Project M/+ community somehow implements rollback so we get a GIFG.
[2:25:48] <+ggbhtg> This is likely the smallest stage of the tourney stages, so it gets sweaty easily
[2:25:48] <ShawnEXE> obviously

[2:26:49] <+ggbhtg> @alonerguy995 he be do
[2:26:51] <%Skullgod> besides icies
[2:27:09] <ShawnEXE> Yeah falco is probably the most broken character on paper
[2:27:12] <%DensityD> this is online melee through https://slippi.gg it is smashbros melee with rollback netcode

[2:27:55] <JetpackMcQuack> like Takeshi's song
[2:27:55] <+ggbhtg> well, we know all the glitches in OOT now, so that's canon too

[2:29:16] <%Struggleful> As a Dizzy main I was spending half the match trying to mash out of stun while I was learning...
[2:29:26] <rcand9> i could watch reggie play melee all day
[2:29:43] <+ggbhtg> UFO, where did you goooo
[2:29:44] <+olive_js> How long has reggie played melee?
[2:29:46] <Mucmaster> It's the kind of thing where beginners like to mash buttons. Its fun to hit things. Mashing becomes annoying as you get into higher levels of play though
[2:29:46] <%DensityD> woolie hates bangers and mash, he will never eat it

[2:31:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> Oh fuck we playing Melee?
[2:31:23] <joylent_blue> oh god this match up
[2:31:32] <ShawnEXE> This matchup is so brutal
[2:31:39] <+BruceyG> brutal for who
[2:31:46] <Melchior_the_Wise> Who's Player 1?
[2:31:47] <JetpackMcQuack> marth mains bro kinamaSmug
[2:31:47] <+ggbhtg> @BruceyG Yes
[2:31:48] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie is so Canadian, apologizing whenever he messes up LUL
[2:31:51] <+BruceyG> i see
[2:31:59] <joylent_blue> for us trying to keep track of the characters lytFIRSTTRY
[2:32:00] <ShawnEXE> It's basically marth juggling falcon forever but then falcon touches marth once and marth is dead
[2:32:04] <%DensityD> who is statistically advantaged in Falcon Vs Marth?
[2:32:05] <%Scrambledjay> Scrambledjay subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[2:32:06] <rcand9> reggie loves melee because no bars to waste
[2:32:09] <%DensityD> lets assume we are the melee gods
[2:32:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Who's playing for Woolie?
[2:32:14] <+ggbhtg> @DensityD Yes.
[2:32:19] <ShawnEXE> At top level marth wins
[2:32:20] <ShawnEXE> 100%
[2:32:23] <sunnythedrunk> THE WARRIOR
[2:32:29] <%halfmasks> WHAT A MADMAN
[2:32:31] <%LastHazzerd> bless
[2:32:33] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:32:34] <ShawnEXE> at mid level falcon wins
[2:32:37] <joylent_blue> Admiral_PopnFresh reggie's been at the wheel the last few matches
[2:32:37] <VJdarkworld> ganon kinda schmovin
[2:32:39] <%Jetzord> What a legend
[2:32:39] <+olive_js> @DensityD Marth by a LONG shot
[2:32:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @joylent_blue fucking sick
[2:32:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:33:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nice combo
[2:33:07] <%HostilePoundcakes> PogChamp
[2:33:08] <slamview> PogChamp
[2:33:10] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus suggest to fizzi a training mode while in queue :)
[2:33:16] <ShawnEXE> Basically falcon is a much easier character to learn the combo and punish game
[2:33:22] <rcand9> reggie showing us what falcon is all about
[2:33:23] <%DensityD> what is the "punch girl" for Fizzi?
[2:33:24] <ShawnEXE> but marth has a better neutral game
[2:33:31] <%halfmasks> I love anyone who talks unironically like Ryu but only when its out of the blue
[2:33:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> can we have a wombo combo
[2:33:36] <%DensityD> nah play puff tho
[2:33:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[2:33:52] <ShawnEXE> so theoretically at top level their punish games are nearly the same but marth has a better neutral
[2:33:53] <+BruceyG> seeing sick shit for sure. or love for the character if they are not directly from the game
[2:34:03] <sosuke5> or boss characters...
[2:34:03] <+Taglog7> Who got da titties?
[2:34:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just pick a top tier

[2:34:38] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> Aka Woolie only picks the boss characters LUL
[2:34:41] <rcand9> i could eat my breakfast of falcons knees
[2:34:45] <NotLikeTexasTV> Yo clippppp
[2:34:48] <VJdarkworld> melee is siiiiick
[2:34:49] <+ggbhtg> For anybody else waiting in the queue, you gotta put in Woolie's code like he does for you. Don't miss out for naught.
[2:34:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Reggie Redemption Arc

[2:35:00] <%Josef_Stryker> After his soul was taken during Ultimate

[2:35:18] <%M3djedx> cosmoAyaya
[2:35:20] <Raldavar> You haven't truly experienced smash until you have mastered Jigglypuff
[2:35:21] <Dannzzyy> No items DansGame
[2:35:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> That ain't falco
[2:35:31] <+ggbhtg> @ShawnEXE It never looked like Ganon, don't lie
[2:35:32] <%DensityD> final destination
[2:35:38] <%DensityD> heaven or hell
[2:35:38] <+olive_js> Is there a way to know if I'm in queue?
[2:35:40] <%DensityD> lets rock

[2:35:46] <%DensityD> fox only

[2:36:07] <ShawnEXE> jump around

[2:36:17] <%halfmasks> meet me at your mommas mommas place, we playing melee
[2:36:34] <ShawnEXE> yeah in general falco's laser is really bad game design
[2:36:46] <+ggbhtg> We livin
[2:36:51] <christopherwpoindexter> @halfmasks that made me think of the lyrics from the Outkast song "Ms. Jackson" LUL
[2:37:01] <ShawnEXE> like in a casual match you could theoretically spam falco lasers
[2:37:01] <+Lizard0TM> Did Woolie neglect to shower for this stream?
[2:37:06] <+ggbhtg> What about against jump in laser
[2:37:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> almost a lucky dash kill
[2:37:08] <+ggbhtg> yep
[2:37:11] <ShawnEXE> and the other person would just be at the mercy
[2:37:12] <$SilverRoddo> Swarmy fox as always!
[2:37:18] <%DensityD> the fox players are really good, BUT ARE THEY REALLY SICK THO?!??!
[2:37:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> yoooo
[2:37:21] <%Struggleful> The on hit sounds were so good in Melee and 64. All the hits in the newer smash games sound so peaceful...

[2:37:57] <ShawnEXE> Melee will never die
[2:37:58] <joylent_blue> lytFIRSTTRY lytBADMAN
[2:38:02] <ShawnEXE> especially with rollback now
[2:38:02] <Smoofmaster> where is woogie right now? he could probably play a pro if he wanted
[2:38:11] <%DensityD> but now, thanks to rollback netcode, we can truely be closer to "ready to react to that"
[2:38:13] <christopherwpoindexter> PogChamp
[2:38:14] <%halfmasks> your top tiers wont stop you from getting BODIED
[2:38:15] <+ThePayphone> i wish samus was as sick in any other smash game as she was in project M

[2:38:28] <Smoofmaster> Samus is sick in melee
[2:38:30] <%DensityD> REGGIE IS FED

[2:38:38] <joylent_blue> woolie typos this stream: woobie, woogie
[2:38:39] <+ggbhtg> Melee wishes it added features like that, nah
[2:38:43] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> !motivated
[2:38:43] <@Moobot> 1506 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:38:44] <ShawnEXE> if anything the only thing bringing melee down is the fact it's so old so it feels hard to keep up with people with decades on this game
[2:38:56] <+ggbhtg> So Tekken LUL
[2:39:02] <%DensityD> wootie wootie wootie wootie
[2:39:08] <+ThePayphone> @Smoofmaster she decent for sure but prject M samus played by esam is a whole nother level of raw hype
[2:39:17] <%DensityD> almost 19 years old
[2:39:19] <+ggbhtg> @ShawnEXE So it's Tekken?
[2:39:20] <christopherwpoindexter> Chiquer Zelda...Sheik or zelda....
[2:39:21] <rcand9> can the fans take reggie 2-0
[2:39:27] <Doublemint_Dave_> @ShawnEXE that's in all fighting games but I will admit it feels very extreme for melee
[2:39:29] <ShawnEXE> Yeah exactly
[2:39:36] <ShawnEXE> Yeah I suppose that's for most fighting games
[2:39:46] <%DensityD> Japanese players, one character, forever
[2:39:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1287839400034996227?s=20
[2:39:48] <ShawnEXE> since fighting game fundies carry over to alot
[2:39:50] <%halfmasks> unfortunately melee cant add a Leroy Smith to let newbies survive pools
[2:39:51] <+ggbhtg> I mean, I do play Tekken against competitive, and I've played this in tourney as well.
[2:39:54] <Doublemint_Dave_> Try getting into marvel when theres killers everywhere
[2:39:56] <Smoofmaster> The literal best player in the world right now started playing over a decade after it came out. Zain is streaming right now

[2:40:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> CMON GUYS WHERE ARE THE KILLERS
[2:40:32] <sunnythedrunk> PogChamp
[2:40:34] <ShawnEXE> but that's also why unrated matchmaking is so good
[2:40:35] <+ggbhtg> Years of EXP isn't everything, killers can appear out of no where
[2:40:36] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie is saucin
[2:40:41] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie is the killer lol
[2:40:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Where are the Kilers in chat to bring back order
[2:40:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> and here I thought the momentum started against him
[2:40:44] <sunnythedrunk> nvm LUL
[2:40:45] <ShawnEXE> let's you find players of all skills
[2:40:47] <+ggbhtg> @sonofthedeepsouth Sorry, this time Reggie IS the killer

[2:41:06] <joylent_blue> come on reggie, show us lytEYES
[2:41:06] <+pkmamsters> "You got an iceclimber?" Reggie: *noise of digust*
[2:41:09] <%Skullgod> i know how to count at 200 bpm
[2:41:14] <2DSuperiority> i'm getting wobbled in my favorite game help
[2:41:16] <Mucmaster> Yeah yeah yeah. Keep that filthy wobbling in there
[2:41:19] <Smoofmaster> wobbling is banned in almost all rulesets atm
[2:41:19] <%DensityD> a niceclimber
[2:41:25] <Smoofmaster> its just not enforced online
[2:41:28] <+ggbhtg> 200 bpm? Get this Air Gear nonsense outta here.
[2:41:30] <Smoofmaster> because how could you
[2:41:37] <ShawnEXE> @WoolieVersus Actually a common problem ice climber players and puff players are facing is that everyone quits out the moment they see them since matchmaking is so fast
[2:41:40] <%halfmasks> reggie pls
[2:41:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I know they "fixed" this stage with no transformations, but I love those stupid shenanigans
[2:41:57] <drhivesphd> wait woolie playing maylay?

[2:42:25] <townzzzzz> smash players the new LTG
[2:42:26] <2DSuperiority> don't shake Jigglypuff players hands, don't look at Jigglypuff players
[2:42:52] <rcand9> sure
[2:43:00] <christopherwpoindexter> i wouldn't mind playing against, I just would rather not play AS ice climber
[2:43:01] <+ggbhtg> Is the way to reset the same as in vanilla Melee?
[2:43:01] <rcand9> a real unranked mode
[2:43:11] <%SirGO0SE> woolieFUN should be woolieFUN :) good philosophy
[2:43:13] <Doublemint_Dave_> woolie pls stop being hung up on "friendlies" lol
[2:43:13] <%DensityD> WHAT A NAME, "FRIENDLIES"
[2:43:14] <Smoofmaster> its also important to be able to leave on the rare occurance of a bad connection
[2:43:17] <joylent_blue> there ARE NO FRIENDLIES lytBADMAN
[2:43:28] <%DensityD> what is "friendlies" in French?
[2:43:29] <+ggbhtg> Friendly Fire, y'know?

[2:43:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 50/50, are gonna play a Climbers player who is practicing wobbling? or are you gonna pay a Climbers player practicing specifically without wobbling?
[2:43:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> friendlies? you mean locals
[2:43:55] <drhivesphd> the only friendlies are friendly fire
[2:44:02] <rcand9> gotta love mike he plays stealth games now
[2:44:12] <+ggbhtg> Doubles has to have Friendly Fire turned on, therefore Friendlies. @WoolieVersus

[2:44:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Miek Russ
[2:44:52] <RastoJJ> if friendlies was the "normal" term and "casuals" was the smash term everyone would be like "CaSuAls???????"
[2:44:57] <+pkmamsters> Mike "Mike Ross" Ross was there to show off the EVO 2020 lineup
[2:44:58] <ShawnEXE> The transformation time is not invincible and super long
[2:45:02] <%Skullgod> its transfomring back is the problem @wooli
[2:45:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Archfoe Codes
[2:45:03] <ShawnEXE> so you can do it offstage
[2:45:06] <drhivesphd> whats the difference of melee fox and falco?
[2:45:08] <+AllenAfro> Am I crazy or is the screen dark
[2:45:11] <Mr_Strut> hot
[2:45:11] <+ggbhtg> The Zelda teleport can be read easier too, imo
[2:45:11] <%Skullgod> its transfomring back is the problem @WoolieVersus
[2:45:13] <ShawnEXE> so many differences
[2:45:18] <+Rafraud> how long is queue?

[2:47:09] <%DensityD> Vintendo Vire Vis Van

[2:47:20] <%DensityD> puff puff pass
[2:47:21] <ShawnEXE> at least puff is straight forward
[2:47:26] <drhivesphd> luigi wavedashes are OD tho
[2:47:33] <RastoJJ> @christopherwpoindexter yessir rsto#976
[2:47:35] <christopherwpoindexter> lugii in this game is literally just a pitch shift in voice clips-OH MY GOD G&W?!
[2:47:44] <Mucmaster> Sex Kick
[2:47:48] <Smoofmaster> Samus' fullstage wavedash is really hard
[2:47:56] <Mr_Strut> sex kick?
[2:48:02] <ShawnEXE> sex kicks in this games are mostly combo breakers
[2:48:03] <%DensityD> beep beep beep
[2:48:03] <Smoofmaster> it comes out frame 3
[2:48:05] <+ggbhtg> Luigi's N-air is NUTZ
[2:48:06] <Viewtiful_Rose> The super wave dash is dumb
[2:48:08] <%DensityD> GET THAT 9
[2:48:11] <%DensityD> PRAY FOR 9
[2:48:14] <Smoofmaster> only shine comes out frame 1
[2:48:17] <Arek_1> I just tuned in. Why is the screen so pink tinted?
[2:48:18] <christopherwpoindexter> @rastojj ah sorry man I don't got a PC gaming setup rn to play much of anything rn, sorry fam
[2:48:21] <+ar4ndomblackguy> ending the stream vs a noob i see Kappa
[2:48:30] <2DSuperiority> coward Sakurai won't put Sex Kick in the ingame tips
[2:48:32] <rcand9> sex kicks are always a fuckin thrill when people say them irl
[2:48:33] <ShawnEXE> yeah shine comes out frame 1 and is invincible on frame 1 only
[2:48:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nice no contact kill
[2:48:34] <Jrocy247> Why is the screen in some weird coloring???
[2:48:35] <@Squdnate> They say game & watch, but it's more like watch & die
[2:48:37] <RastoJJ> sex kick is a lingering hitbox on neutral air that gets weaker as the move stays out
[2:48:41] <christopherwpoindexter> didn't mean to lead ya on, but thx SeemsGood
[2:48:43] <%DensityD> SAUSAGES
[2:48:53] <+ggbhtg> Sorry Alt, only my friend Ali gets 9s when needed, he's the prophet of nines
[2:48:55] <rcand9> bacon 1000%
[2:48:59] <Jrocy247> Like, does anyone else notice the Tint on screen?
[2:49:00] <%CalderGaming> multiple... or is that just in Brawl and onwards
[2:49:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> pancakes
[2:49:04] <drhivesphd> breadbox
[2:49:09] <Mr_Strut> I've played a G&W game that involved flipping sausages
[2:49:10] <Arek_1> @Jrocy247 Same.
[2:49:11] <ShawnEXE> the tint is def flux or something
[2:49:12] <%Struggleful> Debit Card
[2:49:14] <+ggbhtg> Maybe somebody should ACTUALLY play the G&W game it's based on LUL
[2:49:14] <Arek_1> Sausages.
[2:49:19] <%DensityD> DORF
[2:49:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Bacon's the only meat that zig zags
[2:49:23] <Doublemint_Dave_> we call it a credit card around here
[2:49:24] <+ggbhtg> Marker!
[2:49:26] <drhivesphd> DORF Pog
[2:49:27] <%DensityD> PogChamp DORF

[2:49:37] <%Totally_Not_Toby> we love to see dorf
[2:49:37] <DerpioParty> I feel like its sausage
[2:49:38] <rcand9> trophy is wrong
[2:49:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nice Woolie
[2:49:45] <christopherwpoindexter> I feel like the ancient Smash Bros. Brawl Dojo website would clarify
[2:49:50] <ShawnEXE> Oh yeah
[2:49:51] <christopherwpoindexter> 😬😬😬
[2:49:52] <+pkmamsters> i feel like if it was bacon, it'd be more angular
[2:49:52] <ShawnEXE> of course
[2:49:53] <%agoaj> Let\s stretch our legs

[2:54:30] <+Fenrein> I used to run Melee on my laptop and set it up in my school's cafeteria
[2:54:32] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus bro ask fizzi if it would be possible to queue while in training mode or if its on the roadmap
[2:54:36] <KnivesEve> @WoolieVersus first time reading vagabond. its great artwork and story
[2:54:37] <+Rafraud> my main game is PM but it's deadish now
[2:54:38] <%Wool> 3.6 is the last PM before switching to P+
[2:54:42] <VJdarkworld> now its on P+
[2:54:43] <%agoaj> Do a Brawl- episode For Fun instead
[2:54:43] <rcand9> reggie is a dabbler
[2:54:44] <+DarkJayGame> I love you guys
[2:54:45] <sunnythedrunk> I need Woolie to see P+ Knuckles
[2:54:46] <+Fenrein> I'd just get people playing melee against each other and they'd try to beat me
[2:54:48] <craniusmaximus_> It's got Knuckles in it now.
[2:54:51] <%DensityD> just take a shot everytime "*blank* is fucking sick"
[2:54:51] <ThisGuy198> 2.6!! broooooo that was like 10 years ago LUL
[2:54:51] <Doublemint_Dave_> P+ bowser is sick
[2:54:51] <Viewtiful_Rose> It’s really fucking good I’d love to see an episode on it. They just made a new version with PLAYABLE Knuckles
[2:55:01] <2DSuperiority> Sami in Project M would have been the SICKEST SHIT
[2:55:07] <rcand9> roll back real life
[2:55:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Do it yourself cyr5Head
[2:55:17] <+ggbhtg> It's not exactly transferrable tech
[2:55:18] <%DensityD> a passion project you say? woolieT
[2:55:28] <+ggbhtg> it ain't one to one coding
[2:55:31] <Pizza_Mezza> Classic smash rehydrated
[2:55:36] <ThisGuy198> brawl modding is pretty sick tbh
[2:55:36] <%DensityD> woolieS woolieT
[2:55:36] <+ggbhtg> coding never is
[2:55:38] <%DensityD> woolieF woolieU
[2:55:55] <rcand9> roll back is a blessing from godlike coders
[2:56:19] <+Fenrein> I wish I could play Xrd or +R online without all the struggle
[2:56:20] <ChansonNoire> third strike online
[2:56:23] <%agoaj> agoaj subscribed at Tier 1.
[2:56:23] <+ggbhtg> Alpha ONE had it right! @WoolieVersus
[2:56:24] <ChansonNoire> was the first
[2:56:28] <+ggbhtg> Alpha ONE
[2:56:33] <%DensityD> QoL struggle
[2:56:45] <fangovafang> finally got my medicine VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[2:56:45] <ThisGuy198> omg Brawl Minus for fun would be siiiiiiiiiiick
[2:56:51] <VJdarkworld> the delay based union
[2:56:54] <Arek_1> Wasn't HD Remix the first?
[2:57:01] <%DensityD> woolie, if you didn't have these struggles, would you even really have FGC?
[2:57:07] <+jiggy_snipe> there's no excuse not to copy each other
[2:57:10] <Arek_1> Or nah, MvC2 on last gen.
[2:57:12] <+ggbhtg> inb4 it's JP only, no translaters, and they just talk about how great the brands are
[2:57:19] <+ggbhtg> please don't
[2:57:23] <+ggbhtg> don't be that
[2:57:28] <%DensityD> I'll keep putting my foot in my mouth until god strikes me down
[2:57:32] <%SirGO0SE> I want GBVS Rollback so bad
[2:57:35] <GeltonZ> XD @ggbhtg You know what's up.
[2:57:50] <JetpackMcQuack> Absolutely
[2:58:04] <+ggbhtg> Gotta wait for the Riot Games fighter, huh...
[2:58:06] <JetpackMcQuack> And Apex is alive and well
[2:58:09] <ThisGuy198> very smash fan should experience Brawl minus imo
[2:58:09] <%DensityD> I don't play Brawlhalla, what netcode does Brawlhalla have?
[2:58:10] <%Skullgod> imagine playing apex
[2:58:15] <+ggbhtg> We still need to get universal crossplay...
[2:58:17] <%DensityD> Bintendo Bire Bhis Ban
[2:58:46] <ThisGuy198> brallhalla has rollback iirc
[2:58:47] <%DensityD> with blackjack, and hookers
[2:58:47] <@Squdnate> Remember when you had to play the game multiple times to have the characters
[2:58:48] <+ggbhtg> Reminder that only Power Rangers Grid has universal crossplay
[2:59:06] <GeltonZ> @DensityD "What's that? Ban this? Okay!" -Nintendo
[2:59:07] <JetpackMcQuack> I think it's slowly happening
[2:59:07] <+ggbhtg> @Squdnate But now games cost too much to make
[2:59:16] <ChansonNoire> bro ask fizzi about being in queue in training mode, if its possible :(
[2:59:22] <rcand9> it was nice seeing reggie play a game he loves too.
[2:59:23] <%SirGO0SE> 2f entire time
[2:59:28] <%DensityD> Fintendo Fire this Fan
[2:59:30] <+ggbhtg> That 2F was practically offline
[2:59:48] <VJdarkworld> i think there was oh
[2:59:53] <Doublemint_Dave_> Its gonna be time to cry
[2:59:53] <%DensityD> grandpa woolie looking at the next generation of fighting games
[2:59:56] <SomersaultJustice> it's gonna be the same
[2:59:57] <%SirGO0SE> well get ready

[3:00:11] <rcand9> fighting games is pain
[3:00:12] <VJdarkworld> think there was only 2 lag spikes this entire session
[3:00:27] <+ggbhtg> Getting SSDs as the console standard before good internet, jeez
[3:00:27] <%DensityD> thanks Fizzi
[3:00:28] <ThisGuy198> reminder that melee online now have less lag than ult offline
