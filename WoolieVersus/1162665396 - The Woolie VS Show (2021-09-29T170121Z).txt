[1:06:57] <+cermo55> @PhilanthropyG he's from the main fountain, which is special, he's also the only one that we know of from their
[1:07:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @HitchhikingThrough but royalty of one of the side dark worlds i think, but ralsei is from the main one
[1:07:02] <PhilanthropyG> @HitchhikingThrough reverse uno card, Ralsei is the original. Lancer and his dad only showed recently.
[1:07:04] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[1:07:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> You might say shes gonna take Noelles Face.......off
[1:07:12] <peachy996> Probably because Ralsei has a very clear connection to Kris and/or Asriel
[1:07:20] <peachy996> That would be my guest
[1:07:29] <+Akizea> well Ralsei is an anagram for Asriel so
[1:07:37] <HitchhikingThrough> @philanthropyg reverse reverse uno card, we only have ralsei's word that he was first
[1:07:39] <SixthShinx> Scoot that boy to the table, btw
[1:07:43] <+cermo55> push lancer left

[1:13:20] <+Maleicus> suits
[1:13:22] <captain_elsewhere> why not both hassanico2 adumOwo
[1:13:33] <PolitePolicy> Stealing Noelle's items is totally worth it.
[1:13:42] <hassanico2> Yeah especially her watch
[1:13:42] <nanomachiner> rude
[1:13:48] <%BisoromiBear> @nanomachiner probably not
[1:13:50] <peachy996> Picture them as wearing corsets over their suits
[1:14:02] <dukenux> @hassanico2 my guess suit vests
[1:14:03] <hassanico2> why would buff dudes wear corsets though
[1:14:06] <nanomachiner> please do not rob noelle
[1:14:13] <hassanico2> Oh suit vests makes sense
[1:14:15] <PolitePolicy> Always rob noelle.
[1:14:24] <oddbunker> Rob the raindeer
[1:14:26] <hassanico2> Take all of her worldly posesssions
[1:14:35] <+TheFrancix> royal pins are worth it
[1:14:47] <+TheFrancix> mannequin is garbage
[1:15:02] <%teslaclesdeviant_> its useful for the secret boss i guess?
[1:15:11] <underFreddy> uh, I think you'll find the mannequin is the best item in the game?
[1:15:11] <$feiashtear> Mannequin Is good against only one enemy
[1:15:20] <realestjojo> what section is Woolie at
[1:15:23] <laserbeaming> Oh, it's a Big Shot Bowtie. I didn't put 2 and 2 together
[1:15:27] <PolitePolicy> Mannequin just gives you something a lil' extra later on.
[1:15:27] <@Solidus_113> just entered the mansion
[1:15:37] <realestjojo> Ah nice
[1:16:02] <+TheFrancix> is woolie going to do the optional stuff?
[1:16:17] <PolitePolicy> I dunno, is he? These are the mysteries.
[1:16:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheFrancix if he remembers maybe
[1:16:18] <mrpraise_> just arrived, did he get the banana?
[1:16:22] <+thelovingfool> if he remembers to go to garbage area
[1:16:24] <laserbeaming> I'm not sure? Did he do Jevil last time?
[1:16:25] <realestjojo> Oh was this a fresh save?
[1:16:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mrpraise_ potassium
[1:16:28] <hassanico2> but... but the cuteness :(
[1:16:29] <PolitePolicy> I should bloody well hope he got the banana.
[1:16:33] <hassanico2> @realestjojo yes no gear
[1:16:36] <PolitePolicy> He will get sick.
[1:16:43] <realestjojo> Aww
[1:16:44] <@Solidus_113> you can buy amber cards, it's fine
[1:16:51] <captain_elsewhere> just realised, the cafe music remind anyone of a parasite eve tune?
[1:16:56] <+TheFrancix> i hope he remembers to go to the trash zone
[1:17:08] <$feiashtear> nooo
[1:17:08] <+cermo55> fusing item seemes to be a between main adventures thing
[1:17:10] <+ViewtifulJew> NO
[1:17:10] <dukenux> r
[1:17:12] <PolitePolicy> Oh god don't do it.
[1:17:19] <hassanico2> Mannequin has a use?
[1:17:22] <@Solidus_113> also you bought the mannequin for $300
[1:17:28] <%Juriasu> you get so much money in this game, you might as well save it
[1:17:28] <PolitePolicy> Mannequin has a LOT of uses.
[1:17:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> keep it just in case
[1:17:36] <%ne0bunny> you paid 300 to get it woolie
[1:17:50] <+TheFrancix> you get a lot more money by sparing monsters
[1:17:57] <%Juriasu> or hell even buy things you don't think you won't need is a good idea because you might be able to fuse it
[1:17:58] <@Solidus_113> Also you can use the door to teleport back to the garbage heap and meet Spamton like he asked
[1:18:06] <iambqb> The bullet hell mechanic means you can always put in the work to get good whenever you find you're undergeared
[1:18:14] <+thelovingfool> go to garbage area
[1:18:24] <+agumon9000> garbago area
[1:18:28] <hassanico2> I am glad it's legs and not feet

[1:30:16] <Treasure_Vault> Pat is a big shot, he's short
[1:30:19] <hassanico2> Eh Woolie's paranoia is understandable, but we have a big Storage
[1:30:22] <nanomachiner> Well wait, you do have a storage now
[1:30:23] <hassanico2> So you could just like, dump it in there
[1:30:30] <laserbeaming> The items don't matter though. Only restoration is worth it.

[1:33:36] <subjectg> Woolie VS Color Theory
[1:33:38] <%teslaclesdeviant_> CHECK THEM I SPENT SO MUCH TIME NOT GETTING THE MECHANIC
[1:33:39] <Treasure_Vault> I'd love to see a Toby Fox Yoko Taro collab
[1:33:43] <glass_marcus> Art degree time
[1:33:43] <Hirumm> will Woolie get this?
[1:33:50] <+Maleicus> i never seen anyone do this competently
[1:33:50] <laserbeaming> I would expect woolie to be better with colors than Pat
[1:33:51] <hassanico2> Eh let him experiment
[1:34:03] <Treasure_Vault> It's weird, I checked EVERY enemy the first time I saw them
[1:34:15] <Inqy833> Birdies!
[1:34:18] <hassanico2> People really ignore Check huh
[1:34:25] <Treasure_Vault> Because it's a joke, and I want to see the check joke and learn how to win
[1:34:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:34:28] <hassanico2> Guess the Bestiary OCD is only common with a few
[1:34:32] <ChocolateVGZ> how's your color theory?
[1:34:33] <Ecall10528> Makes me sad nobody ever once checks.
[1:34:36] <+TheFrancix> spare
[1:34:42] <dukenux> cause they think: check = missed turn
[1:34:42] <subjectg> there’s some fun jokes in Chekc
[1:34:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:34:46] <PolitePolicy> Oh no.
[1:34:47] <thunka10> this'll be fun
[1:34:48] <@Solidus_113> let him learn chat
[1:34:49] <Treasure_Vault> Every check is more texts, why would you not click it
[1:34:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he'll get it
[1:35:01] <subjectg> Like how Berdly’s check tells you to play “bump of chicken”
[1:35:06] <dukenux> even tho some provide helpful information
[1:35:08] <hassanico2> wait
[1:35:11] <+ATentacleMonster> Hope you both love this wacky ass game LUL
[1:35:14] <hassanico2> Do these guys have 5 different attacks?!
[1:35:18] <hassanico2> One for each color? LUL
[1:35:19] <laserbeaming> if you Check, it'll tell you
[1:35:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea depends on their colors
[1:35:27] <%RyuuAoi> Make it hot!
[1:35:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's cool
[1:35:33] <captain_elsewhere> birbs
[1:35:34] <dukenux> did they dab
[1:35:41] <hassanico2> Color doesn't matter as long as it synchs up once
[1:35:45] <lotharrio> ...Ralsei is a strange name, comparatively
[1:35:47] <Inqy833> POTTERY NOT RESPECTED!!!!!
[1:35:53] <@Solidus_113> you could just walk back to the save
[1:35:54] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie figured it out
[1:35:58] <ChocolateVGZ> There will be plenty swatchlings
[1:36:02] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:36:04] <realestjojo> riiiip
[1:36:08] <ChocolateVGZ> leave the room and come back after this
[1:36:16] <+meniscate> [[BIG SHOT]]
[1:36:17] <thunka10> It's really odd that Woolie used goombella at the start of every fight in Paper Mario, but doesn't use a turn to check in Deltarune.  not bad, I just hadn't noticed until now
[1:36:20] <captain_elsewhere> anyone think those pots look exactly like the genie pot from links awakening ?
[1:36:21] <realestjojo> also man forgot how little money you get for sparing
[1:36:40] <ChocolateVGZ> You get more money based on how much TP you have at the end of the battle, though
[1:36:42] <MethodiaLordae> banger alert
[1:36:44] <thunka10> I thought people would be all or nothing on the check strat
[1:36:49] <Treasure_Vault> is this in roygbiv order?
[1:36:52] <Ecall10528> It depends on how much tp you have.@realestjojo
[1:36:53] <ChocolateVGZ> So if you need to save up cash, can hold off on sparing until maxed
[1:36:54] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i mean you could just grind defend for more tp > more money
[1:37:01] <hassanico2> @Treasure_Vault Blue Green Yellow Brown Red
[1:37:05] <hassanico2> Er, the brown is orange
[1:37:08] <realestjojo> Oh huh didn't know that's how it worked
[1:37:09] <hassanico2> But i Read it as brown
[1:37:20] <thunka10> are you color blind?
[1:37:26] <velgaduere> you can spare on the same turn
[1:37:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:37:29] <hassanico2> No it's just a very brown orange?
[1:37:30] <ChocolateVGZ> Did you match then?
[1:37:30] <MethodiaLordae> lmao
[1:37:32] <$feiashtear> Friend?

[1:37:36] <%livlinn> LUL
[1:37:41] <lotharrio> We had "twin day" at my elementary school. That's the closest I ever got to that.
[1:37:45] <+thelovingfool> WHITE
[1:37:51] <thunka10> just curious, I heard orange browns are a colorblind thing
[1:38:04] <ChocolateVGZ> lol, the icon for magic is fire. None of the party members so far have had fire magic
[1:38:10] <@Solidus_113> you could just walk back to the save, it heals you
[1:38:18] <ChocolateVGZ> ^
[1:38:39] <ChocolateVGZ> I do wish heal spells would cast before spares
[1:38:44] <+TheFrancix> go to  the save point
[1:38:46] <%RyuuAoi> Too bad it's not Persona and you can't swap attack order.
[1:38:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doesn't kris always have a party heal at like 50 tp
[1:38:58] <hassanico2> really?
[1:38:58] <@Solidus_113> that's only for boss fights
[1:39:01] <realestjojo> nope
[1:39:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah
[1:39:03] <GarbageNirvana> Where is the basement anyway
[1:39:03] <subjectg> that’s only for special occasions

[1:55:26] <CaliginousAntic> Why do the monsters have LV?
[1:55:31] <+polothegreatest> oooooh woolieMINHMAX

[1:55:36] <$feiashtear> I died 8 times to the thing coming up
[1:55:36] <oddbunker> these monsters have killed before
[1:55:37] <DarthJawa5> @caliginousantic unknown as of yet
[1:55:38] <%0rond> they aren't monsters
[1:55:39] <+Maleicus> they arent monsters
[1:55:41] <hassanico2> Because the entire lecture on LV is dumb nonsense
[1:55:41] <%0rond> they are darkeners
[1:55:42] <laserbeaming> 369. Nice
[1:55:46] <+MKUltima> mkultiNice
[1:55:49] <realestjojo> Also don't forget that this isn't Undertale
[1:55:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> poof
[1:55:54] <linSP> suzie is the only monster here
[1:55:59] <+MTLxSpider> Someone's bite the dust
[1:55:59] <Champstice> Oh, the upcoming puzzle here's gonna be GREAT
[1:56:02] <+BDazl> Dust
[1:56:02] <realestjojo> LV means something completely different here
[1:56:03] <MethodiaLordae> MC is level 2, true pacifist ruined
[1:56:05] <+Maleicus> bugs
[1:56:05] <SomeOtherNeb> get them double Ds, Woolie
[1:56:05] <linSP> oh and the bird
[1:56:05] <+TheFrancix> dark world LV is different from real world LV
[1:56:08] <+Maleicus> probably
[1:56:08] <lotharrio> Dark Dollar for your money hole.
[1:56:09] <+meniscate> money hole Kreygasm
[1:56:12] <oddbunker> hope so
[1:56:19] <hassanico2> No exit
[1:56:21] <+BDazl> Dark DOLLA
[1:56:21] <DarthJawa5> One dollar PogChamp
[1:56:22] <LoneFonte> LV probably doesn't mean the same thing as Undertale, every party member is LV 2 in chapter 2
[1:56:24] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i lhave a weird thing where i can never get rotation right so this was FUN
[1:56:26] <+TheFrancix> first death might happen
[1:56:27] <%0rond> kris does get LV by defeating darkeners doesn't he?
[1:56:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> weeeeeee
[1:56:29] <realestjojo> Also I know Woolie won't see this, but for anyone else, if you stand around with those chain chomp wires
[1:56:32] <realestjojo> And just stare at them
[1:56:35] <victaghost> 0rond no
[1:56:36] <realestjojo> You might see somethin
[1:56:37] <+tussletoes> did something fade off the edge of the screen there?
[1:56:37] <%0rond> huh
[1:56:39] <SixthShinx> @0rond No, they run away
[1:56:44] <+MKUltima> hecticPeek hecticPeek hecticPeek
[1:56:44] <%0rond> I never fought anyone so I just assumed
[1:56:47] <CaliginousAntic> Kris doesn't technically deafeat darkners in most runs they just run sawa.
[1:56:47] <silverpoyozo> here it comes
[1:56:47] <Ecall10528> It is time.
[1:56:52] <@Solidus_113> good luck

[1:57:28] <+TheFrancix> FIRST DEATH
[1:57:28] <LoneFonte> @0rond they get stat boosts but at no point they level up

[1:57:34] <Ecall10528> 1
[1:57:39] <laserbeaming> TBF, they're bullet colored
[1:57:39] <+CheyMix> first death
[1:57:39] <+Cyan_Dream> Literally shadow puzzles
[1:57:39] <ChocolateVGZ> They patched it so you don't have to dodge the plugs
[1:57:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not bad, this might be the hardest part tbh
[1:57:42] <mothdude> Thank god this respawn point was patched in
[1:57:48] <ChocolateVGZ> used to start back at the save
[1:57:50] <NinjaGentleman> oh nice for them to update the game and not having to walk from the save point
[1:57:51] <sporeian94> $25 if he does it second attempt
[1:57:55] <hassanico2> @LoneFonte well duh no one's dying :)
[1:57:57] <Darthkitten_Prime> Wait there's a respawn point here now?!?
[1:57:59] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:58:00] <MethodiaLordae> @sporeian94 not gonna lie.. kinda cringe

[1:58:10] <@Solidus_113> just watch the shadows
[1:58:10] <ZeeJiggle> Its genuinely tough.

[1:58:11] <Zeif00> LUL
[1:58:11] <%Proxzo> TRUE GAMER
[1:58:12] <%duckmeat_woohoo> This is the Sans fight of Deltarune
[1:58:12] <+VictorVonLouche> Look at the floor not above
[1:58:13] <Nomad94> I died to this so much
[1:58:13] <DarthJawa5> @darthkitten_prime it got patched cause people die here so much
[1:58:13] <nanomachiner> It BEGINS
[1:58:15] <mads_valentine> There are shadows on the screw.
[1:58:18] <peachy996> it's a toughie
[1:58:19] <+YoSoyConando89> This shit is the hardest part
[1:58:19] <%Javaa01> Shadow Puzzles
[1:58:20] <NinjaGentleman> he's surprisingly nailing the spiral down well
[1:58:20] <+TheFrancix> BOI
[1:58:22] <UndeadManatee> forgor
[1:58:23] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i literally died like 15 times on this
[1:58:24] <laserbeaming> looking at the shadows on the floor helps a lot
[1:58:25] <latterbug_> good luck!
[1:58:27] <%Proxzo> Yeah this was a pain
[1:58:31] <+rafeeyell> This was legit the hardest part of the game. I did everything else in one shot
[1:58:33] <laserbeaming> but yes, this one can take you a while
[1:58:33] <%RyuuAoi> There is a pattern. I can see it now. Counter clockwise
[1:58:34] <Darthkitten_Prime> @DarthJawa5 Yeah, I was one of those people.
[1:58:35] <%Proxzo> But pretty amazing when you get it
[1:58:36] <ChocolateVGZ> if you just hold right at the start, the first spiral is easy
[1:58:36] <subjectg> I actually second tried this somehow
[1:58:37] <Ecall10528> Good luck!
[1:58:38] <skinsmckenzie> I actually found it easier to *not* to look at the shadows

[1:59:37] <%storm_odst> He’s doing better than Ross did haha
[1:59:41] <+BDazl> Good QoL patches
[1:59:41] <devanmuse> I lucked the fuck out on this part. did it my first try before even learning those damage dots were a thing
[1:59:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:59:43] <ChocolateVGZ> Would prefer they start you at the switch. But it's probably so you can still leave if you want
[1:59:44] <reonome> LUL
[1:59:47] <+YoSoyConando89> I think the checkpoint came in a patch
[1:59:49] <laserbeaming> I think this load wasn't as fast in the first version

[1:59:58] <%duckmeat_woohoo> Ross DESTROYED his keyboard over this haha. Keys everywhere on the floor

[2:00:03] <hassanico2> Yeah you reloaded at the save point
[2:00:03] <+MTLxSpider> Maybe yes maybe not 🙂
[2:00:04] <PhilanthropyG> if you die again, can we listen to the music?
[2:00:05] <reonome> starboard
[2:00:06] <+thelovingfool> how did I do this first try
[2:00:07] <%robosqueeb> can never ride the disneyland teacup ride ever again without getting triggered
[2:00:09] <%Prevot> starboard first
[2:00:13] <%teslaclesdeviant_> is this what it takes to be a tekken sidestep god
[2:00:13] <subjectg> Portwise and starboardwiss
[2:00:14] <DrStinkers> larboard rotations
[2:00:14] <Dova573> wheres your gold lewis execution
[2:00:16] <+YoSoyConando89> Because it was lame to make you walk back
[2:00:17] <nanomachiner> i spent a good 30 minutes here
[2:00:17] <ChocolateVGZ> larboard
[2:00:19] <+tussletoes> most people had to do this like 3-4 times so
[2:00:22] <MethodiaLordae> Korean teacup slides
[2:00:22] <Broand> Don't overthink it
[2:00:27] <+TheFrancix> did it first try with only 5 hp left
[2:00:27] <$feiashtear> how many has he died?
[2:00:32] <Niney_Who> I generally advise keeping near 4 o'clock after the two spinning parts just because there's more spaces on that side and you can tank some hits
[2:00:33] <CaliginousAntic> Why are there teacups in computerworld anyway? Is ut because of Java?
[2:00:36] <Megaspel> i ended up cheating and slowed the game down
[2:00:40] <%Prevot> Woolie VS directions
[2:00:42] <oddbunker> rip
[2:00:44] <Fisto420> dont think
[2:00:47] <linSP> people died so much here toby had to make the return trip spawn you in the same area
[2:00:48] <+thelovingfool> over thinking
[2:00:49] <+Maleicus> probably java
[2:00:49] <reonome> port woolie
[2:00:50] <+meniscate> Woolie vs Shadows
[2:00:50] <%teslaclesdeviant_> @CaliginousAntic oh that's actually clever
[2:00:51] <peachy996> cuz queen
[2:00:51] <+BDazl> Yes, it's because of Java
[2:00:52] <dds333a> zen
[2:00:55] <ChocolateVGZ> I kind of love that if you're stationary you will actually get hit less
[2:00:56] <%0rond> it's so good too, if you panic and move after you miss you take more damage
[2:00:58] <%robosqueeb> rubberninja broke his keyboard doing this lmao
[2:00:59] <ChocolateVGZ> for some of those
[2:01:00] <+tussletoes> VIdeo gaming is Hard

[2:02:57] <%LastHazzerd> :)
[2:02:59] <Kain5707> did Woolie use the phone by the plugs yet?
[2:03:01] <hassanico2> it's just time based
[2:03:01] <realestjojo> Smile looked familiar too doesn't it?
[2:03:06] <hassanico2> The phone does nothing
[2:03:06] <realestjojo> And you don't need the phone
[2:03:10] <+TheFrancix> spamton time
[2:03:16] <+Maleicus> the phone does the noise anytime in darkworld
[2:03:16] <hassanico2> BLUE BALLED
[2:03:18] <Niney_Who> Chat shush
[2:03:19] <PolitePolicy> Someone has a theory that the dog dollar will eventually be worth so few dark dollars that it'll stack overflow and be worth max money.
[2:03:20] <Qsmash_> never read the chat when streaming undertale(deltarune)
[2:03:21] <latterbug_> D:
[2:03:22] <ChocolateVGZ> cheshire cat lookin ass

[2:03:28] <Ecall10528> Hou dont need to use the phone, thats misinformation, shows up anyway.
[2:03:30] <+TheFrancix> suspense
[2:03:32] <+BDazl> Good time for a break
[2:03:34] <stubborndeer> Dog dollar is tradeable in game for a high armor
[2:03:35] <dds333a> BRB
[2:03:36] <Visorak6> Put people in emote mode when you get back

[2:03:49] <Broand> They gonna use the toilet at the same time, they gotta be married
[2:03:52] <latterbug_> SourPls
[2:03:57] <CaliginousAntic> The only belief I have is that the dog dollar can only be used for a Toby store that has an item that costs 1 dog dollar.
[2:03:59] <realestjojo> Also we don't need to be in emote mode yet
[2:04:01] <Hirumm> SourPls
[2:04:09] <realestjojo> There's still more to it

[2:04:15] <defaultname3887> yea sen us to jail
[2:04:21] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe there will be other dogdollars to collect, and if you get them all, toby will kill you again
[2:04:23] <peachy996> Yeah you gotta some more stuff before the thing happens

[2:04:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Menitta break
[2:04:55] <stubborndeer> No dog dollar currency has no instrinsic value a single dog dollar is hte same is twenty dog dollars, it depends on what the dog sales machine wants at the time
[2:04:55] <defaultname3887> wait can the mods put us on jail before woolie gets back?
[2:04:59] <+MTLxSpider> they go peepeepoopoo

[2:05:29] <latterbug_> dogJAM
[2:05:39] <stubborndeer> so if the dog trademan wants steel, and he only has wood, he needs the dog dollar so he will trade a lot of wood for it so that he can get that dog dollar for the steel
[2:05:42] <%livlinn> forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry
[2:05:50] <Ecall10528> Or the dog dollar decreses so much it underflows into infinite money.

[2:27:21] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:27:21] <NDenizen> smells like bags of sand
[2:27:22] <%LastHazzerd> the inside of an old beer bottle
[2:27:23] <hassanico2> They just added a counter
[2:27:23] <%Necnill> limmyEcciedLGif limmyEcciedMGif limmyEcciedRGif
[2:27:25] <realestjojo> @sporeian94 Lol nope
[2:27:26] <yoshir_in_the_cape> FUNNYCHEAT
[2:27:28] <Broand> sort of
[2:27:29] <%teslaclesdeviant_> no it actually makes him stronger
[2:27:29] <ChocolateVGZ> Last I knew, they made it so if you do it, he gets angry and does more damage
[2:27:30] <tattleworm> they patched it so he counters it by doing more damage
[2:27:30] <@Solidus_113> he gets upset and deals double damage if you do it
[2:27:30] <%0rond> they didn't patch it out, but now he gets super mad if you do it and starts dealing way more damage
[2:27:30] <hassanico2> It counts how many times you use the exploit
[2:27:37] <stubborndeer> A FREE VALUE
[2:27:39] <stubborndeer> ??
[2:27:40] <realestjojo> Like triple damage
[2:27:41] <Ecall10528> He goes super mode if you use it now.@sporeian94
[2:27:42] <+secretspud> They did not patch it out, they patched in a special response to it though
[2:27:50] <dds333a> For free?!
[2:27:51] <+DJSummers101> We can make this fight harder now? NICE!
[2:27:58] <tigerfang86> lmao
[2:28:02] <ChocolateVGZ> lol wtf
[2:28:02] <%robosqueeb> wow spamton really doesnt like susie
[2:28:05] <dds333a> LUL LU
[2:28:05] <hassanico2> So this is gonna end up a practice fight right?
[2:28:05] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:28:06] <+Parrish_broadnax> Never
[2:28:07] <codymagpie> :(
[2:28:12] <dds333a> no DarkMode
[2:28:14] <LoneFonte> wait, what is the exploit?
[2:28:16] <therat_giant> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:28:16] <SixthShinx> But there is no audience LUL
[2:28:17] <hassanico2> I know Woolie's shmup skills are better
[2:28:18] <ChocolateVGZ> susie has her tank stance on
[2:28:20] <reonome> SourPls
[2:28:22] <hassanico2> @LoneFonte infinite charge shots
[2:28:26] <sporeian94> I feel Jevil is harder to be honest
[2:28:26] <%LastHazzerd> SourPls
[2:28:27] <CaliginousAntic> A real [Big Shot] move is to make him harder on purpose and play the fight normally. B)
[2:28:29] <%0rond> if you hold enter you can fire infinite charge shots
[2:28:41] <ShadeTheNovice> this is indeed the super boss Kappa
[2:28:41] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> the dialog in the background says "knight/mike (not sure) wont you pick up the phone, pull the strings and make it ring"
[2:28:43] <yoshir_in_the_cape> DONT DO INFINITE SHOTS
[2:28:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He’s on controller thought so so exploit
[2:28:54] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> i mean the voices in teh back of the song
[2:29:02] <codymagpie> deal
[2:29:05] <realestjojo> Sigma-ass face
[2:29:08] <%drefizz> 3 easy payments of 9.99? Deal
[2:29:19] <%LastHazzerd> @sporeian94 i feel Jevil is a harder jump from the rest of his chapter, ch.2's level of difficulty is generally more demanding than ch.1's
[2:29:20] <CaliginousAntic> Jevil is harder because the damage to the party is much higher and in Spamton the party can actually ACT.
[2:29:24] <+TheFrancix> can't heal?
[2:29:28] <SomeOtherNeb> all you need is [Hyperlink Blocked]
[2:29:28] <hassanico2> The handphone thing is... so weird
[2:29:31] <ChocolateVGZ> PogChamp wow I really don't need friends
[2:29:31] <lotharrio> Take 2!
[2:29:33] <hassanico2> Even with all the weird stuff
[2:29:33] <charrchord> a bulletproof argument
[2:29:33] <@Solidus_113> that one's really hard
[2:29:34] <realestjojo> God I hate that pattern the most
[2:29:35] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> GG
[2:29:36] <%RealThiele> F
[2:29:36] <stubborndeer> Man megaton neo is out of his mind
[2:29:36] <oddbunker> oof
[2:29:37] <hassanico2> Good practice fight!
[2:29:37] <+Parrish_broadnax> Twas not the big Shot
[2:29:38] <dds333a> Not a bad dodge there SeemsGood
[2:29:40] <Visorak6> go buy some heals
[2:29:41] <codymagpie> Ded :(
[2:29:41] <SixthShinx> Yup, phone hands is tough
[2:29:44] <laserbeaming> the hand phones are hard
[2:29:48] <+cmdrmobium> game over music is good at least
[2:29:52] <stubborndeer> You have to beat him with video games
[2:29:57] <stubborndeer> more options faster
[2:29:58] <Zeif00> Pretty good first try tho
[2:30:01] <%LastHazzerd> damaging Spam reduces the length of the attacks, right?
[2:30:01] <CaliginousAntic> Hand phones are the hardest attack
[2:30:02] <ChocolateVGZ> Certain attacks, if you shoot good it will even add to his Mercy Gauge
[2:30:07] <+Cyan_Dream> Just be a [big shot]
[2:30:10] <SomeOtherNeb> doing enoguh damage with the shots also gives a bit mroe mercy
[2:30:18] <defaultname3887> decent attempt tho
[2:30:18] <ShadeTheNovice> yeah get some items
[2:30:20] <ChocolateVGZ> ... put the disk in
[2:30:23] <+kalyxchews> the leadup to this really psyched me out thinking i should only bring solo heal items
[2:30:27] <codymagpie> it's all about the shots :(
[2:30:28] <shauntungosaurus> not about the shots? what about the [BIG]?
[2:30:30] <skinsmckenzie> get some items
[2:30:30] <lotharrio> I saw Mercy% go up during the shots, yeah.
[2:30:35] <%teslaclesdeviant_> he might need to get more healing items lol
[2:30:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:30:42] <@Solidus_113> it's to give you the option to buy more healing
[2:30:44] <Ecall10528> Buy some more items.
[2:30:48] <%LastHazzerd> healing items are for the weak

[2:31:04] <%duckmeat_woohoo> The quick load/absent dialogu is a really smart choice
[2:31:05] <realestjojo> Nah Woolie will just one-shot it Kappa
[2:31:05] <hassanico2> @lotharrio blowing up the heart increases mercy
[2:31:23] <NDenizen> [[BIG SHOT]]
[2:31:25] <%Proxzo> {BIG SHOT}
[2:31:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> [BIG SHOT]
[2:31:28] <sporeian94> snap all when you can
[2:31:29] <stubborndeer> I think the megaton Neo bossfight is timed so the faster you pick options the better it is
[2:31:32] <reonome> [BIG SHOT]
[2:31:32] <Nomad94> [BIG SHOT]
[2:31:35] <ChocolateVGZ> Big Shot isn't good for getting through the walls cause you hit the + bombs too much
[2:31:37] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> I assume this means all the superbosses will use the undertale modes
[2:31:39] <ChocolateVGZ> but other than that it's amazin
[2:31:42] <CaliginousAntic> Snap all is 7% so you get a +1%
[2:31:44] <hassanico2> Like any shmup, it helps to know where things come from
[2:31:46] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> like blue for platforming, the rotating shield one from undyne etc
[2:31:47] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls [BIG SHOT] SourPls
[2:31:50] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> but each will get a new technique
[2:31:54] <yoshir_in_the_cape> SNapAll is more efficient
[2:31:57] <ChocolateVGZ> @TheJollyFlyingMan I hope so. Sounds so fun
[2:32:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> look at him go
[2:32:04] <yet_another_brony> yeye ultimate heal you wont regret ot
[2:32:05] <%LastHazzerd> them bombs tho
[2:32:12] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> [BIGGER SHOT] - Avoiding copyright issues version
[2:32:12] <deviljhojho_> BIG SHOT
[2:32:13] <NDenizen> This fight is a "real" NEO fight so not necessarily, might just be Toby doing what he couldn't do in UT the first time
[2:32:17] <%teslaclesdeviant_> that attack is way easier without chrarge shots
[2:32:24] <realestjojo> Did anyone hear the dialogue behind the music btw
[2:32:26] <sporeian94> Woolie snap all
[2:32:34] <hassanico2> Let him figure it out Kappa
[2:32:43] <@Solidus_113> it's only the 2nd try, chill
[2:32:44] <CaliginousAntic> It'd be cool if all superbosses are meant to be spins on fights from UnderTale
[2:32:48] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> @realestjojo the parts that are known are "knight/mike wont you pick up the phone, pull the strings and make it ring"
[2:32:51] <ChocolateVGZ> Normal Route Mettaton had the yellow hart shmup stuff, it was just vertical instead
[2:32:53] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie listen to my demands as a stranger on the internet
[2:32:55] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> its too hard to tell if its knight or mike
[2:33:00] <ChocolateVGZ> omg I spelled heart wrong
[2:33:01] <hassanico2> Yeah, heart exploding gives 3%
[2:33:01] <sullivansbizarreadventure> This fight scares me. I doubt I’d be able to do it
[2:33:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh yea 3% for the hear nice
[2:33:02] <realestjojo> I'm thinking Mike
[2:33:05] <NDenizen> "might"
[2:33:09] <%RyuuAoi> Flawless
[2:33:14] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> yeah mike is probably the villain for part 3
[2:33:15] <charrchord> It pulls the strings and makes them ring
[2:33:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pipis
[2:33:18] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> just like jevil said queen
[2:33:19] <CaliginousAntic> pipis
[2:33:24] <laserbeaming> Beware the pipis
[2:33:25] <%LastHazzerd> wasted super charges
[2:33:27] <+brownhornet420> NICE PIPIS
[2:33:29] <oddbunker> nice shots
[2:33:29] <thisisnozakuboynozaku> this theme is Fire bo8Jamming
[2:33:34] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> but Gaster is the one calling for sure becuase hes the man who speaks in hands
[2:33:34] <%Proxzo> NICE PIPIS
[2:33:38] <+HereticSoul> perfect pipis phase
[2:33:38] <ChocolateVGZ> what if chapter 3 boss is pipis
[2:33:39] <sporeian94> the pipis one fucking is the worst
[2:33:46] <CaliginousAntic> The trick with Pipis is to aim after the bounce
[2:33:51] <ShadeTheNovice> nice pipis -> 🔵
[2:34:03] <%RealThiele> Cornholio approves
[2:34:06] <ChocolateVGZ> got a long way to go baby
[2:34:09] <realestjojo> There is another theory regarding Mike tho but that may be getting a bit ahead of things
[2:34:17] <ChocolateVGZ> keep shootin bigshot
[2:34:24] <%TomAtlus> CRACKLING with freedom

[2:38:29] <%LastHazzerd> right at the end
[2:38:32] <+Maleicus> man of the pipis
[2:38:33] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> i think the fact that he makes the pipis eggs right after the phone call is more gaster hinting and ties him to the easter eggs too
[2:38:46] <ChocolateVGZ> Egg Route
[2:38:58] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> egg%
[2:39:03] <ChocolateVGZ> grooving to the music makes you play better, this is true

[2:53:36] <@Solidus_113> you get one for beating Jevil too
[2:53:38] <realestjojo> God, I still can't believe Toby actually added something if you happen to have a full equipment storage before getting him
[2:53:44] <Niney_Who> And you turn into Super sonic
[2:53:49] <ChocolateVGZ> P.S., use the crystal for something
[2:53:49] <wantedsafe471> Galvan wheel, Galvan deal
[2:53:52] <cheapdoc> Or you get a super DUPER boss
[2:53:54] <SixthShinx> You can use the crystal
[2:53:56] <Inqy833> For the super super boss
[2:53:59] <subjectg> The realest lore is in the trash zone, it’s very easy to miss
[2:54:00] <+kalyxchews> POWER OF [Friend(s)]
[2:54:00] <DarthJawa5> or you unlock the supersuperboss
[2:54:01] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> you get to fight Gaster i hope
[2:54:02] <thunka10> super DUPER boss
[2:54:04] <Alzero83> Friendship beam LUL
[2:54:05] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> SANS 2.0
[2:54:08] <realestjojo> Well there is also a PureCrystal...
[2:54:09] <deviljhojho_> ....?
[2:54:10] <CaliginousAntic> All the Super bosses give you ACT commands for the final super boss would be amazing
[2:54:12] <thunka10> ...?
[2:54:14] <NDenizen> kromer
[2:54:15] <%LastHazzerd> you get all 7 and then you personally can run toby over with a plastic car

[2:54:30] <ChocolateVGZ> get big kromer
[2:54:30] <deviljhojho_> increased KROMER
[2:54:32] <SixthShinx> You can examine the shadowcrystal
[2:54:32] <yoshir_in_the_cape> give it to ralz for better heals
[2:54:33] <velgaduere> it's better on someone who uses magic
[2:54:34] <SomeOtherNeb> the armor probably also makes you a [BIG SHOT]
[2:54:35] <+TheFrancix> could give it to ralsei
[2:54:37] <+polothegreatest> just like narutos LUL
[2:54:39] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i feel like the boss armors are basically best on ralsei
[2:54:46] <laserbeaming> More Magic on Ralsei is good
[2:54:47] <CaliginousAntic> Ralsei wearing the glasses would be cool in universe
[2:54:49] <%teslaclesdeviant_> he needs the def and magic
[2:54:51] <+Yamchadassist> i dont wanna be that guy but he should say no
[2:54:52] <JurassicRaptor> Did it all for the KROMER
[2:54:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ooh big heals
[2:54:56] <Alzero83> Toby did say it took this long to make chapter 2 cause he was writing the scripts for all the chapters, meaning we may get the next ones sooner than we did this episode
[2:54:57] <cheapdoc> Is Deltarune just rpg guilty gear?
[2:55:02] <Niney_Who> Ralsei heals about 5x his magic
[2:55:05] <%RealThiele> healer need gear
[2:55:05] <realestjojo> Is it still Dealmaker if you don't spare him?
[2:55:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao "two pairs of glasses"
[2:55:09] <cipher758> @teslaclesdeviant_ me too. he's usually the first to go down
[2:55:11] <mothdude> Deltarune is just Persona
[2:55:16] <%robosqueeb> I'm hoping we get the next chapters by the end of next year
[2:55:21] <tigerfang86> yea

[2:56:28] <ChocolateVGZ> one depending on how you beat him yes, spamton does the same
[2:56:29] <Niney_Who> Pacifism gives your Armor, violence gives you Weapons

[3:16:51] <shauntungosaurus> blue being coldes tand red being hottest
[3:16:52] <+TheFrancix> from big shot to big fuckup
[3:17:02] <+Rafraud> This is a sick enemy for colorblind people
[3:17:03] <charrchord> This is just like that mario and luigi virus fight
[3:17:04] <+Maleicus> nope
[3:17:06] <+compassarisen> RGB butlers
[3:17:06] <emptyantics> Oh how the turns have tabled

[3:17:23] <%RyuuAoi> Billy would never be able to play this.
[3:17:24] <Shirousuke1989> if you cool the red one with kris
[3:17:26] <laserbeaming> if you coldify the red one, it's done
[3:17:27] <Shirousuke1989> you can spare two
[3:17:30] <realestjojo> nice dodging
[3:17:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:17:39] <+Maleicus> nope

[3:18:29] <Qu1ckyyy> This OST is so good
[3:18:31] <+CashewZero> They just need to be matching
[3:18:36] <@Solidus_113> it was changed after the match
[3:18:37] <+Rafraud> big crazy
[3:18:38] <+thelovingfool> crazy
[3:18:40] <peanutdot007> They need to have matching colors
[3:18:40] <Ecall10528> They just need to match.
[3:18:43] <+JeluxDaCasual> matching colors
[3:18:44] <+Rafraud> colorblind Kappa
[3:18:44] <%RealThiele> they just have to match once
[3:18:46] <PhilanthropyG> check them again next time
[3:18:47] <Shirousuke1989> you matched them then colded one
[3:18:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they weren't at the end of the turn but at one point they were
[3:18:49] <+Stakillix> After they matched, he made one colder
[3:18:50] <realestjojo> Also the things that Kris say in their warm and cold chat are very nostalgic-sounding
[3:18:52] <laserbeaming> They have to be all matched to the same color. Doesn't matter which.
[3:18:53] <ChocolateVGZ> The Pottery NotLikeThis
[3:18:54] <thunka10> at one point during that team they were both red, then you turned one orange, so thery were synchronized at one point
[3:18:57] <%teslaclesdeviant_> he matched them then immediately unmatched so they were still sparable
[3:18:58] <+agumon9000> They were all red and then you made it orange. But since they were all the same at one point you could spare them
[3:18:59] <iambqb> What happened is you matched them, and then changed the colors, but still met the spare condition
[3:19:02] <ChocolateVGZ> You get an item if you UFO them all
[3:19:05] <wantedsafe471> wait, they're birds and using feather dusters to clean themselves. it be like a person using a hair brush made of hair
[3:19:12] <ChocolateVGZ> NotLikeThis
[3:19:18] <5Headedragon> They matched once, so you could spare them
[3:19:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh well

[3:35:04] <skinsmckenzie> ...
[3:35:04] <dan_g_v> it's nice that Ralsei is Ralsei and not a younger version of my brother from the real world
[3:35:04] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> Ralsei is part of kris's mind or something
[3:35:05] <laserbeaming> The song's name was Acid Tunnel of Love, after all
[3:35:05] <CaliginousAntic> ...
[3:35:07] <Inqy833> A loveboat in acid. What kind of metaphor is that?
[3:35:07] <available_line> At least you are not taking acid. Or are you?
[3:35:09] <lotharrio> Gotta try to go for the throuple ending.
[3:35:09] <velgaduere> thank you for the reminder of the absurdity

[3:35:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hmmm
[3:35:38] <existingdark> pacifist route? Nah. Genocide? get outta here. Romance route? Hell yes, finally some real shit
[3:35:41] <dan_g_v> as long as you're not like my real life brother, you're good Ralsei
[3:35:41] <+Rafraud> NO NO FINISH YOUR THOUGHT RALSEI
[3:35:46] <wantedsafe471> sus
[3:35:46] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no you won'tst'!!
[3:35:46] <+RyTYoung> I have opinions
[3:35:54] <%jolene_orenji> a ralsei-like is a game where dying is common place and your items get lost with each different run
[3:35:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HERE WE GO
[3:35:57] <ChocolateVGZ> I hope Ralsei isn't Asriel, it's too obvious lol
[3:35:58] <televisedrevolting> ADOPTED
[3:35:58] <skinsmckenzie> Yeah he isn't
[3:35:59] <vedajuno> oh boy here he comes

[3:36:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS TIME
[3:36:07] <%Prevot> what are you doing step-kris?
[3:36:11] <%sewermonk> Ralseis portrait isnt Black and White
[3:36:13] <Qsmash_> Asriel seems like he would be much older
[3:36:14] <dan_g_v> don't worry, it's just step-bro, not real brother brother!
[3:36:14] <laserbeaming> it's time
[3:36:16] <lyzejag> ITS TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME
[3:36:17] <CaliginousAntic> But it doesn't disprove an association
[3:36:17] <+Rafraud> THE BOY
[3:36:17] <ChocolateVGZ> Also he looks too young; Asriel has to be at least 19 or some shit right?
[3:36:17] <%teslaclesdeviant_> its cool to bone your adopted brother's alternate universe form
[3:36:18] <realestjojo> Fun fact guys! When Kris drinks Ralsei's tea. He doesnt react to it. Almost as if it also tastes like water....
[3:36:19] <+Rafraud> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO

[4:35:01] <Inqy833> Duck feels like it should be best
[4:35:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NGL I would like a new Punch Out on Switch
[4:35:02] <MyNameIsRasus> @Solidus_113 there's GAMEPLAY DIFFERENCES???
[4:35:05] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:35:10] <+Cyan_Dream> Did Woolie ever play Punch out? He should give it a go sometime
[4:35:12] <grovertoast> @MyNameIsRasus yup
[4:35:14] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S RAD
[4:35:15] <jorniev> man you're so gonna end up fighting your dad
[4:35:17] <+TheFrancix> USE ITEMS
[4:35:18] <MasterTonberry23> Dodged right into it smh
[4:35:19] <+Rafraud> With the snowgrave route this whole dialogue has much different context lol
[4:35:20] <Megaspel> I think it depends on the head/top
[4:35:23] <cipher758> ultra instinct
[4:35:26] <PolitePolicy> Duck's special makes you do a LOT less damage, I think.
[4:35:36] <MasterTonberry23> @Rafraud funny since you dont even get this fight in snowgrave
[4:35:38] <PolitePolicy> But it also makes a quacking noise when you hit Queen.
[4:35:50] <grovertoast> susie masher

[4:36:16] <%RealThiele> no punch wollz vs all punch peach
[4:36:17] <+Rafraud> @MasterTonberry23 As in the things queen is saying here has more context if you do snowgrave then do this fight on a diff file

[5:14:04] <%RyuuAoi> Do it like Persona 2 and make you buy the cds ha
[5:14:12] <ChocolateVGZ> If you missed Jevil and go back and beat him on the file you imported from, you can get the item/crystal from the hole, I heard
[5:14:18] <%livlinn> LUL
[5:14:24] <ChocolateVGZ> You can't get both items it seems, though
[5:14:26] <DianaTheAscian> @grovertoast a ittle car can be next to that door but idk y its not there
[5:14:29] <+TheFrancix> @subjectg it gives you the boss item in case you miss the in the previous chapter
[5:14:31] <+Double_Tap_That> Don't be afraid to dream, but eventually you'll have to wake up as well.

[5:17:35] <MasterTonberry23> Oh they did Spamton NEO?
[5:17:39] <dukenux> huh
[5:17:48] <Kain5707> check the hole
[5:17:50] <dukenux> so if you come back to ch1...
[5:17:50] <realestjojo> Huh didn't know it accounts for that
[5:17:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what
[5:17:56] <bobdoletrasher> it do
[5:17:56] <+CheyMix> yeah so he didnt do it
[5:17:59] <yoshir_in_the_cape> it does
[5:18:00] <MasterTonberry23> OR DOES IT
[5:18:01] <dukenux> so you don't have to replay whole thing?
[5:18:02] <SixthShinx> Go back to the hole on the left side of town
[5:18:03] <charm_quark_> does it wollie, does it not know
[5:18:04] <mothdude> It counts no matter what save file you beat Jevil on
[5:18:06] <+VictorVonLouche> Because its assuming you might have switched platforms
[5:18:14] <5Headedragon> You can go back and get it
[5:18:17] <Anonymasque> I got this and have the same question
[5:18:21] <@Solidus_113> it's because you have the chapter select now
[5:18:23] <Lisonfire> it can't tell if its a different computer
[5:18:23] <mesamus> you can replay chapter 1 later and get jevil's item
[5:18:26] <DianaTheAscian> oh does the shard appear in the hole?
[5:18:30] <+asgard147> monkaS
[5:18:32] <emptyantics> This guy is just Plague lol
[5:18:42] <ZeeJiggle> I mean that's just decent advice in general.

[5:18:48] <+asgard147> caught by what? monkaS limesS
[5:18:50] <dukenux> you can copy it
[5:19:05] <grovertoast> u can copy it over too if you find it i think
[5:19:07] <ChocolateVGZ> its okay if you hurry you can get through ch1 in less than an hour
[5:19:15] <Kain5707> SPLORT
[5:19:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so do you get like a chapter select after this?
[5:19:37] <grovertoast> we'll see
[5:19:39] <yagirlmayalazarus> Where did the shadow crystal from beating NEO go?
[5:19:46] <ChocolateVGZ> Seam holds onto it
[5:19:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:19:47] <mesamus> either complete chapter 2 on switch or go play chapter 1 in this computer
[5:19:48] <subjectg> Seam has it
[5:20:05] <yagirlmayalazarus> Oh Seam takes them? Interesting.
[5:20:31] <ChocolateVGZ> Twisted Sword is actually not possible to get yet
[5:20:35] <realestjojo> The fact that he also fuses the Thorn Ring
[5:20:37] <+asgard147> Thornring limesEvil
[5:20:50] <+cermo55> top chef
[5:20:54] <emptyantics> Soaking is the new Thorning
[5:20:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS not the ring
[5:21:02] <+Yamchadassist> might need twisted sword in another playthorugh
[5:21:04] <realestjojo> Makes me wonder if there'll be a "third" path when the full game's out
[5:21:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Mama miba!
[5:21:11] <Shwepie> Why is the Thornring a fusion item?
[5:21:19] <Ecall10528> Thornring huh? Now that sounds interesting. Kappa
[5:21:21] <%cyberspacecat> yikesring
[5:21:25] <realestjojo> You can puss out of that route at the last second
[5:21:27] <realestjojo> And keep it
[5:21:40] <ChocolateVGZ> Yeah you can't retrieve it if you stick with it, can you
[5:21:49] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe in a later chapter?

[5:45:38] <ChocolateVGZ> Am I the only one who finds the vague religion in Deltarune kind of creepy? I can't tell if it's just me not growing up religious
[5:45:44] <ChocolateVGZ> that makes me feel this way
[5:45:47] <heartlesshealer> Yoshi oh no
[5:45:49] <realestjojo> i feel the same way
[5:45:52] <ChocolateVGZ> also rip yoshi
[5:45:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Is this the voice of Alternate timeline Father Woolie?
[5:46:00] <cipher758> "the angel"
[5:46:00] <velgaduere> @ChocolateVGZ that's intentiona
[5:46:00] <PhilanthropyG> I find this extra funny, because Tori mentioned Asriel had a bday party themed after yoshi, so EXTRA hurt
[5:46:01] <velgaduere> l
[5:46:04] <subjectg> Asriel really loves lizards in this
[5:46:05] <ShadeTheNovice> asriel canonically loves Yoshi
[5:46:09] <MasterTonberry23> @ChocolateVGZ eh all religions are creepy. life after death? get outta here with that
[5:46:11] <thunka10> D:
[5:46:11] <realestjojo> it's too uncanny
[5:46:11] <ChocolateVGZ> Asriel love yoshi
[5:46:14] <+BDazl> Toriel even in her Undertale iteration has a bit of a religious sort of flavor kinda? It was less overt though
[5:46:18] <%teslaclesdeviant_> asriel would be a yoshi main

[5:49:07] <+BDazl> Kris actually isn't a silent protagonist, just the Player can't hear him. The other characters repeat what Kris says all the time.

[5:50:20] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus they talk about a 2 lightners and a prince of darkness saving stuff, but lancer is the only prince of darkness that has ever done anything to impact the endings, instead of ralsei

[5:51:06] <%teslaclesdeviant_> oh watanagashi?
[5:51:07] <MasterTonberry23> does she have faces where her hands would be?
[5:51:16] <%LastHazzerd> "why" is such a hopeless question
[5:51:21] <ChocolateVGZ> purple guy
[5:51:22] <MyNameIsRasus> So what're the odds that Noelle's mom is the Mayor?
[5:51:23] <realestjojo> how is she even talking
[5:51:26] <+Brunocarvalhoc> apparently that sound coming from the door is the cellphone sound slowed down
[5:51:26] <+insanestephen> my guess is muffett is mayor
[5:51:30] <T_Sasquatch> So does she only give handjobs
[5:51:34] <Lieutenant_America> that Ice E guy is a serial killer I swear
[5:51:38] <velgaduere> @realestjojo with her mouth, of course
[5:51:39] <wantedsafe471> Yeah that is an interesting question. You're the only human in the town. where are all the other humans?
[5:51:44] <MasterTonberry23> @insanestephen no it's noelle's bitch mom
[5:51:48] <%LastHazzerd> QC
[5:51:49] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> ^^ yes I believe barney ice-ee dude is a major villain
[5:51:53] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> he will be important in a later chapter
[5:52:00] <+BDazl> I am very curious about the other humans. We know they _exist_ because the book in the library explicitly mentions them. But we don't see them
[5:52:06] <ChocolateVGZ> It's pretty heavily implied Noelle's mom is mayor, but we don't know for sure, he could easily swerve it
[5:52:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Ice E Hoshikage just wants to live a quiet life
[5:52:10] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> I think ICE-EE actually does eat kids
[5:52:20] <+BDazl> Ice Wolf is super cute

[6:27:17] <laserbeaming> Alphys says she refills the milk in the last chapter
[6:27:19] <Louie_Salmon> Wait does that mean Alphy's cat is just Susie
[6:27:21] <%teslaclesdeviant_> susie is a fucking racoon
[6:27:22] <heartlesshealer> so alphys has been feeding susie instead of a cat
[6:27:24] <ChocolateVGZ> Oh thats right, there's two screens, sorry

[6:29:26] <DedlokPM> Yeah that was the bunny girl that had a bunny pet on a leash in Undertale
[6:29:32] <wembleyttv> That's metatons house if I remember?
[6:29:33] <%blastyoboots> @BDazl I thought you recognized the dummy cause they were dummy THICC

[6:29:41] <grovertoast> is that the dummy then metaton?
[6:29:44] <mothdude> It was actually her brother, not a pet.
[6:29:46] <ChocolateVGZ> seems so
[6:29:47] <MyNameIsRasus> @BDazl Right? A couple words and you can tell who it is. Fucking great writing.

[6:30:50] <missingangle> Cause he's not even a tragic king figure. HE's just... pathetic
[6:30:51] <EASrake> Asgore's gonna get foreclosed on
[6:30:52] <+HikariSentinel> Never seen a man so divorced.

[6:32:47] <EASrake> Kris is an imp
[6:32:51] <+Rafraud> I mean kris might actually be super depressed lol
[6:32:54] <mesamus> onion only appears with ch 1 file
[6:32:54] <Vigogs> I love how Kris looks like a lil psycho
[6:32:55] <+thelovingfool> onion is only if u do it on ch1
[6:33:00] <ChocolateVGZ> Wonder if Kris will get better or something and then we see their eyes
[6:33:00] <%RyuuAoi> Kris been THROUGH

[6:33:04] <+Rafraud> Sadge kid

[6:33:32] <+BDazl> FINALLY THEY GET TO MEET
[6:33:53] <+Rafraud> best part best part
[6:33:54] <%RyTYoung> What gets me is Kris is one letter removed from Frisk and another anagram, Toby why you do this to us woolieFABRICATION
[6:33:55] <ChocolateVGZ> And they refuse to look into Asriel's browser history room. AAAND the news clipping about Asgore being removed from the police, and then suddenly Kris stops reading...
[6:33:59] <evilzoey> my fav part
[6:34:03] <+Pachi3000> "goddammit kris where the fuck are we"
[6:34:06] <VorpalSlash> I love this sprite so much

[6:38:15] <%LastHazzerd> it's Kris
[6:38:17] <skinsmckenzie> "I was just stretching my legs on the windowsill"
[6:38:19] <+Pachi3000> bye

[6:38:22] <%rasamune> @hassanico2 That's just Kris
[6:38:23] <thewizardchan> Aint no strings on me
[6:38:23] <tigerfang86> Bye
[6:38:26] <coracor> ded
[6:38:26] <%RyTYoung> I'm out
[6:38:28] <GarbageNirvana> Delightfully devilish, Kris
[6:38:29] <%LastHazzerd> just Kris things
[6:38:30] <realestjojo> @hassanico2 I think it's incredibly painful to maybe go without a soul
[6:38:32] <missingangle> "Ah you know what? He JUST left."
[6:38:32] <wantedsafe471> No strings attached
[6:38:34] <ChocolateVGZ> we dunno really but join the guessing game
[6:38:34] <JurassicRaptor> I-so-metric exercise
[6:38:36] <+Walopoh> Back to happy music! :D
[6:38:36] <Shwepie> @hassanico2 Just ripped his own heart out, clearly having a hard time.
[6:38:36] <hassanico2> But it's not HIS soul
[6:38:37] <+BDazl> rip kris, went out just like Papyrus avoiding 1 on 1 training
[6:38:41] <+Pachi3000> aight imma head out
[6:38:42] <+Rafraud> This scene is so well written man
[6:38:43] <%RyuuAoi> KRIS IS ....possessed?
[6:38:43] <+Rafraud> Lmao
[6:38:48] <realestjojo> hence why they can't do it for a long while
[6:38:50] <cipher758> he reaaaally loves pies huh
[6:38:56] <dukenux> is that a coke joke
[6:38:59] <%drefizz> @hassanico2 kris has to poop outside
[6:39:02] <cipher758> *they
[6:39:05] <wembleyttv> It's odd how Susie is more of a child to her than you are
[6:39:07] <+asgard147> monkaS
[6:39:21] <Wingsofdarkness2> LUL
[6:39:21] <wembleyttv> I do understand why though
[6:39:23] <realestjojo> also Kris goes by they don't forget
[6:39:24] <+BDazl> this feels so weird seeing them keep chatting like this
[6:39:26] <ChocolateVGZ> Susie acts like she doesn't spend much time at home.
[6:39:29] <nanomachiner> @hassanico2 maybe his butt hurts
[6:39:32] <+compassarisen> Toriel just has unbounded mom energy
[6:39:32] <ChocolateVGZ> Or maybe she doesn't have a home. :c
[6:39:40] <thewizardchan> It very well might be Kris' own soul and that's what we're controlling.
[6:39:46] <tigerfang86> D:

[6:41:24] <%LastHazzerd> this game series is MADE for theory crafting
[6:41:25] <%0rond> my theory is kris is an artificial human that was given someone else's soul
[6:41:39] <%RyuuAoi> Yo. Kris can't be trusted!
[6:41:40] <EASrake> What's weird is that Kris puts the soul back in
[6:41:43] <%paladinstarbuster> theorycraft woolie
[6:41:45] <+asgard147> limesS
[6:41:45] <dukenux> monkaS

[6:41:57] <+asgard147> bless you Woolie
[6:41:59] <Shwepie> Camera sticks with the soul, but audio sticks with the body.  Fun times.

[6:42:00] <ChocolateVGZ> Body might not work without the soul
[6:42:00] <evilzoey> bless you
[6:42:07] <%LastHazzerd> he's allergic to pie
[6:42:09] <Sapphire_Breeze> monkaS
[6:42:11] <realestjojo> mine is that with Kris being so interested in magic irl, they accidentally made contact with...someone
[6:42:18] <+BDazl> I think it's kinda like what was implied with Spamton's puppet theme. Kris will eventually die if left without the SOUL too long.
[6:42:20] <realestjojo> that someone being us
[6:42:21] <%RealThiele> mom has seen some shit
[6:42:22] <grovertoast> oof

[6:42:31] <+asgard147> oof
[6:42:33] <peachy996> I think Kris without Soul has goals he still needs the soul for.

[6:42:57] <wembleyttv> I dont think Kris can die without a soul
[6:43:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ASGORE IS SO DIVORCED
[6:43:03] <realestjojo> Yeah...call parents
[6:43:09] <thewizardchan> It's amazing how few people catch the floral scented bin as well
[6:43:11] <dukenux> parents, right.. .
[6:43:11] <peachy996> Asgore is getting to Huey Emmerich levels of oof
[6:43:12] <Nevflinn> Asgore BibleThump

[6:43:16] <ChocolateVGZ> She didn't call anyone tho :(
[6:43:18] <realestjojo> definitely called her parents there
[6:43:18] <tigerfang86> Hm
[6:43:18] <mothdude> Susie does NOT call her parents
[6:43:21] <ChocolateVGZ> She's going to get in trouble
[6:43:23] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe
[6:43:25] <%RyTYoung> I know its weird
[6:43:30] <%RealThiele> or Kris wants to be evil and we wont let him
[6:43:33] <pricklypissant> Susie is homeless.
[6:43:35] <%RyTYoung> Maybe...she doesn't have parents?
[6:43:37] <%rasamune> Not like someone has to tell you to sit, right :3
[6:43:40] <+BDazl> Man I can't wait for Susie to see the cover to How To Draw Dragons
[6:43:41] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh god yeah she doesnt have her own room either
[6:43:44] <%RyTYoung> You don't know where she lives
[6:43:46] <silverpoyozo> @pricklypissant probably =(
[6:43:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> She super doesn’t have parents...
[6:43:55] <+BDazl> Time to pet some Cats
[6:43:55] <evilzoey> neco arc
[6:43:56] <ChocolateVGZ> Given her reaction to having her own room in Ralsei's castle
[6:43:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Maybe
[6:43:59] <ChocolateVGZ> I feel like maybe
[6:43:59] <dukenux> "Come home, watch tv?"
[6:44:05] <Lieutenant_America> @realthiele I don't think evil, given their reaction to Snowgrave and obvious affection for specific characters
[6:44:13] <wantedsafe471> Hell Busters, Doom Guys favorite show
[6:44:14] <%RealThiele> true but this is sus af
[6:44:14] <laserbeaming> given how much of a Freak Ice-E is, I'd like to see that movie
[6:44:18] <Shwepie> Invasion of the Cat Petters sounds like something Plague would make.
[6:44:23] <dukenux> mmm
[6:44:27] <nanomachiner> mmmm
[6:44:29] <+Rafraud> SUSIE AT RISK
[6:44:32] <hassanico2> ...they're literally objects
[6:44:40] <%drefizz> @RealThiele you'll know soon
[6:44:42] <dukenux> Susie, did you forgot Lancer almost DIED?
[6:44:42] <ChocolateVGZ> Does Susie just not get it, or is she being optimistic?
[6:44:42] <hassanico2> That won't work Suize
[6:44:43] <EASrake> Susie doesn't get it
[6:44:44] <grovertoast> yeah lets do it
[6:44:45] <wantedsafe471> DEW IT
[6:44:52] <evilzoey> do the dew
[6:44:54] <+Rafraud> If she does that then we get titans
[6:44:54] <televisedrevolting> Aw man, hell yeah ESCAPISM FROM PROBLEMS
[6:44:55] <+polothegreatest> BibleThump
[6:44:55] <Lieutenant_America> SOUL being the fun police
[6:44:57] <realestjojo> @realthiele I'm under the full impression Kris would never let shit like Snowgrave happen if they were under full control
[6:44:57] <+Rafraud> Probs dont lmao
[6:45:04] <skinsmckenzie> placating the Suze
[6:45:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:45:05] <realestjojo> we the baddie there
[6:45:05] <mothdude> I love escapism
[6:45:07] <laserbeaming> I don't think she realizes that
[6:45:13] <+BDazl> She didn't know what happened to Lancer when they came back to the light world, so yeah, she just doesn't know
[6:45:13] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, I don't know, have darkners tried existing in this world?
[6:45:18] <+Walopoh> Tbf Susie is the main force for good here
[6:45:21] <scrumbotime> (she drank some of that)
[6:45:22] <%LastHazzerd> fountains mean we go to their world, she wants them to come to ours
[6:45:22] <evilzoey> hahaha
[6:45:27] <+Rafraud> "Come on Kris they're just TITANS"
[6:45:27] <%RealThiele> i mean we bring lancer back and he becoems a card
[6:45:31] <ChocolateVGZ> I feel like Susie is the protagonist sometimes
[6:45:35] <skinsmckenzie> when's Susie gonna become the main character?
[6:45:35] <%RyuuAoi> Jurassic World vibes
[6:45:39] <peachy996> I don't think Kris with no Soul intentions are for pure good or evil. He has his own motives
[6:45:41] <MyNameIsRasus> FESTIVAL EPISODE LESS GO
[6:45:45] <thewizardchan> In my mind, Kris feels like a puppet, and they're desperately trying to break free.
[6:45:49] <Lieutenant_America> @walopoh Susie is literally the only main character with no dirty laundry in any route
[6:45:49] <skinsmckenzie> SUSIE
[6:45:52] <Shwepie> @LastHazzerd Light Fountains, problem solved. Easy.

[6:46:00] <+Slattsquatch> Susie is somehow the most unambiguously good character of the main trio
[6:46:02] <+MagiKestral> I'm excited for Susie to be the final boss of Pipis Route. We need a remix of Vs Susiw

[6:46:32] <+MagiKestral> fun fact: if you say ralsei or noelle, Kris apparently says their name really confused. as if they'd only say their names if WE told them to say it
[6:46:33] <+BDazl> Susiezilla hype

[6:50:41] <+asgard147> She might pop up half-way through the next chapter?
[6:50:41] <SteelSnake93101> He opened the door too
[6:50:42] <+Walopoh> Undyne gonna be a goddamned Superhero in the Dark Realm
[6:50:43] <+Rafraud> Chara was just a shit kid
[6:50:49] <bruuzer12> What if Asgore gets caught up?
[6:50:50] <laserbeaming> Kris DID leave the door open
[6:50:50] <$JobbedBone> So far it has been board games and the internet, two ways to ESCAPE from real life
[6:50:51] <missingangle> Toriel as a party member and she just throws pies
[6:50:53] <peachy996> so we'll see how Toriel reacts to Ralsei
[6:50:55] <+BDazl> [[BIG SHOT]]
[6:50:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SEVEN CHAPTERS
[6:50:55] <dukenux> Ralsei will show up again too, cause i feel like he can just sense those fountains opening
[6:50:56] <+FxyDEV> do we have time for EVIL?
[6:50:57] <wembleyttv> In Charas ending she has that evil smile and in genocide you give Chara your soul and destroy the world and move onto the next
[6:50:58] <Lieutenant_America> they've put too much work characterizing Kris as sympathetic for them to just be evil- especially when it's such an obvious guess
[6:50:58] <MyNameIsRasus> GOOD WORK TOBY
[6:50:59] <+MagiKestral> Chara had a lot more hate in their heart than Kris seems to have. especially when THEY keep closing the fountains they open
[6:51:00] <+Rafraud> THREE MORE YEARS
[6:51:05] <@Solidus_113> and this is where you would normally find out about 7 chapters
[6:51:05] <$JobbedBone> so I'm thinking the next one will be television
[6:51:05] <+BDazl> Playable Toriel will be hype
[6:51:06] <dukenux> like, he just went to the Cyberwrold
[6:51:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> TV is next for escapism
[6:51:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FxyDEV def not today
[6:51:09] <Louie_Salmon> Yep
[6:51:09] <evilzoey> See you all in three years...
[6:51:09] <thunka10> Kicked
[6:51:12] <silverpoyozo> god I CANT WAIT ANYMORE
[6:51:14] <realestjojo> SEE Y'ALL IN 4 YEARS
[6:51:17] <ExileNineteen> @MagiKestral well, they don't, the player does right
[6:51:22] <+Rafraud> TIME TO KILL
[6:51:23] <thewizardchan> @BDazl Holy shit maybe that's how Sans and Papyrus "just showed up" in Undertale.
[6:51:26] <EASrake> That was the main menu
[6:51:28] <+polothegreatest> bayo3 levels of patience
[6:51:33] <peachy996> Find out in 4 years on the next episode of Deltarune
[6:51:41] <+BDazl> @thewizardchan Could be!
[6:51:47] <wembleyttv> And the line "When was you in the one in control"
[6:51:50] <tezelbezel> deltrune 7 coming 2045!
[6:51:54] <%RyuuAoi> Careful not to pop up the porn!
[6:51:55] <+Double_Tap_That> Can't wait for my kids to play Deltarun when it finall comes out!
[6:51:56] <ChocolateVGZ> Toriel Party Member next time
[6:51:59] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe
[6:52:01] <wantedsafe471> Wait, when did kris have to time to make a dark fountain for the computer room?
[6:52:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not holding my breath but I really hope it doesn't take as long for the next parts to come out
[6:52:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:52:16] <ChocolateVGZ> We don't know that they did for sure
[6:52:16] <%teslaclesdeviant_> at nnight?
[6:52:16] <%livlinn> Toby did dirty on Minh woolieMINHMAX kyoryuCrynosaur
[6:52:17] <roboyuji> Isn't it supposed to be the rest next time?
[6:52:17] <%RealThiele> Goatmom magus
[6:52:20] <SteelSnake93101> @wantedsafe471 The night before probably
[6:52:21] <ExileNineteen> @wantedsafe471 i think he did it the night before chapter 2, at the end of chapter 1
[6:52:22] <subjectg> last chapter, when they tossed their soul in the birdcage
[6:52:24] <dukenux> @wantedsafe471 in the night between ch1 and 2
[6:52:25] <DetroitSentai> @wantedsafe471 at the end of ch1 when he throws you out
[6:52:27] <realestjojo> There isn't a 3rd one
[6:52:29] <ShadeTheNovice> @wantedsafe471 between chapters Im assuming during the night
[6:52:30] <+BDazl> Weird Route / Snowgrave yeah
[6:52:30] <+Rafraud> There's only 2 runs in this one
[6:52:30] <+FxyDEV> theyre the same run
[6:52:31] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's a whole thing.
[6:52:32] <ChocolateVGZ> It's internally referred to as "Weird"
[6:52:32] <grovertoast> there's no geno run?
[6:52:33] <+thelovingfool> no third
[6:52:34] <cipher758> weird route
[6:52:35] <@Solidus_113> genocide is "weird"
[6:52:36] <%0rond> weird is the name for this game's genocide run
[6:52:37] <%ThatsMyTrunks> There's only the one more route. Super worth doing.
[6:52:39] <+Rafraud> Weird route is only other one
[6:52:39] <subjectg> pipis route
[6:52:39] <velgaduere> Weird basically is Genocide
[6:52:41] <zk_nails> really only 2
[6:52:41] <+Slattsquatch> Geno IS the weird run
[6:52:42] <evilzoey> genocide is weird run
[6:52:42] <heartlesshealer> The file names just call it "weird"
[6:52:42] <+GrandFig> it's only weird route
[6:52:42] <wantedsafe471> Ah, that does make sense
[6:52:43] <bobdoletrasher> just normal and weird
[6:52:43] <ChocolateVGZ> If you beat the Queen with violence, Berdly's arm gets ruined
[6:52:50] <DetroitSentai> its not genocide but its not not genocide
[6:52:50] <%RyTYoung> There's a "weird route"
[6:52:50] <%RealThiele> chat shutup bout spoilers
[6:52:51] <%blastyoboots> ssssshhhhhhhhh
[6:52:52] <+thelovingfool> Geno is the weird yeah
[6:52:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> weird route is a worse genocide route
[6:52:53] <ShadeTheNovice> there is only normal and weird
[6:52:54] <@Solidus_113> the 3rd is just a variation of pacifist
[6:52:55] <Louie_Salmon> You can do them together, that's probably the way to go
[6:52:58] <%RyuuAoi> Play 3rd Strike woolieVS Punchmom, Woolie!
[6:52:59] <+Walopoh> Hallo y'all
[6:53:03] <laserbeaming> It's weird. you don't kill every character, but you kill characters in a specific way
[6:53:06] <wembleyttv> Deltarune is undertale genocide run
[6:53:09] <+cermo55> The Deltarune alt rount is more specific than just kill everything
[6:53:16] <existingdark> well right on time for me to clock out. Thank you two for the stream today!
[6:53:25] <+BDazl> Weird has much stronger differences. Attacking people without going Weird Route gets a slightly different ending otherwise.
[6:53:27] <%LastHazzerd> things are indeed being said
[6:53:28] <realestjojo> it's not too long to do that route
[6:53:40] <%livlinn> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[6:53:46] <nanomachiner> it HAS been 7 hours, so clear to try it another time
[6:53:46] <Eger007> SNOWGRAVE
[6:53:49] <roboyuji> I can't bring myself to do the geno runs
[6:53:50] <nanomachiner> It won't be TOO long though
[6:53:57] <realestjojo> yeah def not in this stream
[6:54:01] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie, who is "you" in that statment
[6:54:03] <+BDazl> Oh that's a cool theory
[6:54:04] <nanomachiner> maybe a good 2 or 3 hrs
[6:54:04] <@Solidus_113> think back to after Spamton Neo, where "Kris" is yelling and has goosebumps
[6:54:04] <%RyTYoung> I think theres, pacifist, violent and then snowgrave
[6:54:04] <realestjojo> would have to be another
[6:54:06] <wantedsafe471> No, the heart is us. i think
[6:54:08] <mothdude> It's like Spamton. Can't live without your strings.
[6:54:09] <cipher758> lol 🔪
[6:54:11] <%RyuuAoi> P5: Take Your Heart
[6:54:14] <realestjojo> awww
[6:54:18] <+AmanDotZip> @wantedsafe471 yeha i think its the player pov
[6:54:22] <+Rafraud> Kris is just mad about the divorce so they kick you out of control to lash out
[6:54:24] <wembleyttv> Sans does say mid fight talk about different worlds and timelines
[6:54:28] <+BDazl> It's been a really fun stream!
[6:54:32] <Eger007> you should chech it out later, its shorter
[6:54:35] <%LastHazzerd> playing on your own is much better for retention of information
[6:54:39] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus it's weird enough that some litty reacts would be neat
[6:54:40] <@Solidus_113> Queen is perfect
[6:54:43] <realestjojo> queen the GOAT
[6:54:45] <laserbeaming> I love Queen
[6:54:47] <+Walopoh> LYING
[6:54:50] <ChocolateVGZ> hoo
[6:54:54] <%RealThiele> L M A O
[6:54:56] <Kain5707> SPLORT
[6:55:08] <dukenux> i hope Ralsei gets a bit more development next part
[6:55:08] <ChocolateVGZ> sweet kid, hope nothing bad happens to her
[6:55:12] <ExileNineteen> LOL
[6:55:12] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[6:55:15] <Shwepie> Loved Berdly finding out Queen only plays mobile games.
[6:55:15] <%RyuuAoi> Big stream today! BIG thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Madden!!
[6:55:17] <+Rafraud> Kappa
[6:55:25] <grovertoast> quiet y'all
[6:55:25] <wantedsafe471> Can't wait to see woolie play the Geno/Weird run
[6:55:31] <ChocolateVGZ> Toby knows people love their ships lol
[6:55:35] <heartlesshealer> the sadie hawkman's dance would be cool
[6:55:41] <@Solidus_113> Asgore the most divorced man in history
[6:55:51] <realestjojo> @wantedsafe471 unfortunately he just said he's gonna do it off-stream
[6:55:59] <wantedsafe471> Big Bummer
[6:56:02] <%RealThiele> multi-dimensional divorcing
[6:56:13] <dukenux> She turned the weens against him!
[6:56:14] <wembleyttv> Think is what about Gaster
[6:56:21] <wembleyttv> *thing
[6:56:26] <+Rafraud> HIRE MORE PPL TOBY

[6:56:31] <+BDazl> Geeeeeeet dunked on
[6:56:32] <+Rafraud> FUCK FALCO
[6:56:32] <@Solidus_113> he did
[6:56:34] <realestjojo> he did!
[6:56:38] <%RealThiele> IQ Diaper
[6:56:41] <wembleyttv> Could Gaster be a good person?
[6:56:42] <@Solidus_113> 3-5
[6:56:47] <realestjojo> that's how chapter 2 even happened in the first place
[6:56:49] <@Solidus_113> full product you pay for
[6:56:51] <%LastHazzerd> many of the designs weren't toby's a few songs weren't toby's. for Ch.2
[6:56:55] <grovertoast> 3-5 I think is the next one
[6:56:56] <Drusain> The next release would be 3-5
[6:57:13] <@Solidus_113> 6 and 7 are likely DLC
[6:57:14] <wembleyttv> I think Toby has it all planned out
[6:57:15] <evilzoey> toby's expanding his team to release 3-5 at once
[6:57:16] <realestjojo> Oh thought next was all the rest
[6:57:19] <+BDazl> 70 hour RPG where if you make even one mistake the entire run is on the wrong route and chat will never let you live it down
[6:57:29] <Azmodem> Dont forget Wollie , you choices dont matter, untill they do
[6:57:30] <%xeromage> she adds a lot to it
