[0:03:25] <cosmicteapots> sub or dub
[0:03:25] <%cache_22> What was the concensus on Dubs woolieVS Subs for this?
[0:03:31] <@Menitta> yeyeye himbo time
[0:03:33] <%faeron93> faeron93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Enjoy this look at the future. One of the rare cases where its difficult to decide which language to play in as both are really good, but have fun nonetheless. Fun fact: in the Japanese dub, Ichiban shares the same voice actor as Nishiki.
[0:03:33] <Artoo_The_Me> ICHIBAN #1
[0:03:34] <bigmaraippo> there was a poll
[0:03:35] <+Plesin> sbfpYeyeye
[0:03:36] <%X2Eliah> Woolz gon play subz for sure
[0:03:40] <+lazysaiyajin> nice
[0:03:43] <%Asuterisuku> So regarding the crash that happened in Batman yesterday.
[0:03:46] <BlackermanZX> Woolz is gonna play both
[0:03:46] <@Menitta> the poll was incredibly close
[0:03:46] <nicversus> this song still gives me the feels
[0:03:47] <Karego_at> god i hope it's subs
[0:03:50] <+McSoliace> @cache_22 he's trying both
[0:03:51] <$dudedude55555> @cache_22 woolie is 2 weeb for dub
[0:03:53] <+chicken_danger> play 0 you cowards
[0:03:54] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Pookiedaexzile
[0:03:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sub is the true way, but he said he was gonna switch around back and forth
[0:03:55] <%JustYudha> Yeeeeee GET THAT SPONSOR MONEY
[0:03:55] <lagon137> The dub of this game is phenomenal
[0:03:59] <%holydeviant1> holydeviant1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I can't wait for Woolie to get character whiplash from Ichiban holy shit
[0:04:03] <+bustawof> doodBait
[0:04:09] <%X2Eliah> @chicken_danger But 0 is not MONNNNEY
[0:04:09] <NotHereToStream> ICHIBAN LETS GO
[0:04:13] <%ChoculaUltra> woolieMIRIN
[0:04:14] <@Squdnate> I really hope its the DUB. Because that dub needs to be exposed to as many people as possible, in just how fucking GOOD it is
[0:04:16] <+Wiithan6> both the sub and dub for this are incredible, now wrong answer here imo
[0:04:17] <Pyrrhus90> gotta pay the bills
[0:04:19] <+Dova573> I for sure prefer ichis dub vocie over the sub
[0:04:21] <BlackermanZX> Dub is fucking amazing
[0:04:24] <%Asuterisuku> Nvidia actually dropped support for PhysX SPECIFICALLY for the RTX 30 series cards. The game is officially too old to run properly on modern hardware.
[0:04:25] <+Dova573> voice
[0:04:28] <Laycas49> yeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:04:34] <%X2Eliah> @Asuterisuku ahahahahhaaaaa
[0:04:36] <@akuda_bar> @Asuterisuku amazing
[0:04:38] <nottotallyoriginal> WOAH LAD?
[0:04:43] <Karego_at> switching? that's worse than just going with the dub lmao, but i guess sponsor's word is law
[0:04:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nishikichiban is fucking amazing
[0:04:43] <+SpcOpsBear> Dub has exclusive scene
[0:04:43] <%Ozymandias555> Ozymandias555 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hey Woolie, hope you’re doing good! Remember to give both languages a chance, cuz even the Eng dub is downright amazing and hits it out of the park! And as always, thanks for getting me into fighting games!
[0:04:44] <downwiththethickness99> Like A Dragon? But what if i dont wanna Like A Dragon Kappa
[0:04:44] <%runegod20> didn't Woolie say he was gonna switch between dub and sub between sessions? I hope he does mid session only to hear both the japanese and english versions of the songs since I can see him forgetting to do so when he switches off
[0:04:45] <+zzNamttamzz> KasugaYeah
[0:04:51] <themememovement> My only gripe with the dub are not all characters are dubbed and the karaoke
[0:04:53] <%zanzibar_junker> ProZD is in it a lot roo
[0:05:13] <%Mrbaconator> he is? i only recall him being in small parts
[0:05:14] <+Dova573> The dub karoke is great
[0:05:16] <%Ozymandias555> The karaoke dub is great
[0:05:23] <+Dova573> they hammed it up
[0:05:24] <%Kaito_Cam> gaijinYo gaijinOO gaijinOO gaijinOO
[0:05:25] <%runegod20> can see woolie only doing the karaoke once in one language and never touching it again, especially with the different language
[0:05:27] <%X2Eliah> yakuz lick a dragon
[0:05:30] <%Asuterisuku> Pat told Woolie a while ago to do the dub instead of the sub.
[0:05:31] <jack_s1n> Dub now sub in 4 years when he plays for real
[0:05:31] <dangelo_god> yo when I get a.ps5 I'm getting that game
[0:05:31] <themememovement> yeah but Solid Snake singing Machine Gun Kiss tho!!

[0:06:20] <+nevermorecake> It's WEDNESDAY my kyodais
[0:06:23] <%Exiliator> I prefer the sub :)
[0:06:28] <%Asuterisuku> @arkv01 Promotional stream, I think it was.
[0:06:30] <+SpcOpsBear> @squdnate IDK, maybe some pizza
[0:06:30] <hassanico2> @arkv01 Sega paid him
[0:06:31] <Pookiedaexzile> He get them Sonic Boom Bucks
[0:06:35] <@Menitta> I played it subbed so I'd prefer this be dub
[0:06:36] <skyentombment> so hey how come woolie's jumped ahead so far?
[0:06:37] <themememovement> @arkv01 sponsored stream for Yakuza 7
[0:06:37] <%Asuterisuku> Should be going back to 0 next week.
[0:06:38] <Karego_at> yea sub for sure, if only for nishiki voice
[0:06:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NISHIKI GOAT SUB
[0:06:48] <@Squdnate> Good choices of food
[0:06:48] <%ChoculaUltra> realistically - if I wanted to just jump into Like A Dragon without playing any of the other Yakuzies am I going to suffer through the story?
[0:06:49] <arkv01> ahhh should be fine if it's a one off, won't be any major spoiler sfor previous games
[0:06:49] <%X2Eliah> @Asuterisuku maybe not next week
[0:06:51] <Dalaigh> miyLurk
[0:06:58] <BlackermanZX> he actually said a couple of sessions
[0:07:00] <hassanico2> I've liternally not seen anyone play it subbed so it'd be a real nice change to finally hear the sub
[0:07:07] <%X2Eliah> iirc Woolz posted that they will do the first... bunhc.. of hours? like maybe 13 hrs or so
[0:07:08] <Karego_at> think it might be a couple weeks? i remember him saying that
[0:07:09] <+BrandtHighwind> BrandtHighwind subscribed with Prime. 
[0:07:09] <themememovement> 13 hours
[0:07:09] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Like 13 hours he said
[0:07:10] <TheCrispyBoi> @ChoculaUltra no
[0:07:12] <%solracc25> Are you ready for bread in 4k
[0:07:13] <skyentombment> this is gonna be a weird good experience, comparing 0 to this one
[0:07:13] <%holydeviant1> @ChoculaUltra It stands alone, but some cameos will bounce off you
[0:07:16] <arkv01> doubt they'll get into spoiler territory even 20 hours in
[0:07:17] <youngking_kush> LAD is definitely NOT a 1-off
[0:07:20] <%ChoculaUltra> oh dope
[0:07:25] <%gatorafan> YEYEYEYE the hypest sellout on Twitch!
[0:07:27] <@Squdnate> Btw. Tonight and the next stream or two, is gonna be Yakuza 7. For those who dont know. ITS NOT GONNA REPLACE YAKUZA 0. This is a sponsored stream by SEGA and the upcomming PS5 version

[0:07:53] <%heartlesshealer> it's not a sellout if he was gonna play it eventually anyway
[0:07:54] <@Menitta> just a few streams.

[0:09:53] <CappuccinoGuil> BEST BOY TIME
[0:09:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Why can't every game let you pick which characters get dub  or sub per character like fighting games.
[0:09:57] <%ChoculaUltra> "We will pay you with all the Persona collab items we've ever done in the history of PSO2"
[0:09:57] <fritz_dacat> Shocked
[0:09:57] <Karego_at> is it just americans wanting the dub, tf is wrong with you?? :'DD
[0:09:58] <BigManLugan> hopefully he starts dubbed for George Takei
[0:10:00] <YakumoYomi> Crazy to think that Yakuza was a JRPG all along, and I just didn't see it because of the combat system
[0:10:02] <velgaduere> YOU WA SHOCK
[0:10:06] <hassanico2> @faeron93 why would a company associate with Pat?
[0:10:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> @menitta so we doing sub or dub
[0:10:12] <%holydeviant1> I think Woolie was the right pick for this sponsorship, if only for the snap between 0 and 7
[0:10:14] <@Menitta> iunno
[0:10:14] <@akuda_bar> yet too be seen
[0:10:15] <crazy_man185> both
[0:10:16] <+McSoliace> with dub you can multitask if its sub your fucked if you are busy
[0:10:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! First Red Bull, Artesian Builds, now Sega. KOTOR might have ended, but the spirit of POCKETS will never die.
[0:10:16] <%faeron93> @hassanico2 woolieKICKDAD
[0:10:18] <waffleandman> i like the dub
[0:10:18] <samazam94> so this will be with V right? kinda wish its reggie. would love to see our pure boy reacting to this series
[0:10:20] <Pookiedaexzile> I want Mark Hamil Majima to talk to Japanese Kiryu
[0:10:23] <majindusto> Woolie is gonna forget  so much  about Yakuza 0 BibleThump
[0:10:25] <missingangle> Both at the same time
[0:10:26] <hassanico2> last I checked Sub won the youtube poll
[0:10:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> I did sub for myself but dub is also great
[0:10:30] <Louie_Salmon> I voted for dub on the poll and listen to more the subs last night, I could honestly go either way, they're both great.
[0:10:33] <%Lion_kun> What's better, Yakuza as a JRPG or P5 as an action game?
[0:10:33] <%gatorafan> woolieKICKDAD
[0:10:45] <357Sneak> lytKILLGOKU U lytBADMAN WA lytAGH SHOCK MorphinTime
[0:10:48] <Kyoshikei> the dub is actually pretty good
[0:10:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Scoll help
[0:10:50] <fritz_dacat> Yo Wa Shock! woolieGLORY
[0:10:51] <Mr_Rakjo> U WA SHOCk
[0:10:54] <@Menitta> if all games did the fighting game thing of choosing which characters speak what, then you end up with Tekken cutscenes.
[0:10:55] <MyNameIsRasus> the dub is great
[0:10:55] <+shootbang_exe> yes
[0:10:57] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, I absolutely hate Musou games but P5S got me hooked bad
[0:10:57] <nicversus> You KNOW it's a good dub, when Pat refused to put on the dub of JUDGMENT because he hates dubs, and like 5 minutes into Yakuza 7 he was like "This dub is GREAT:
[0:10:59] <Karego_at> subs aallll the way, yakuza sounds so weird in english yall just can't read
[0:10:59] <srv4254> i like strikers but yakuza is a different level
[0:11:04] <+lil_pudintater9> shes right, i am shock
[0:11:06] <%orcstr16> @Lion_kun Yakuza as an rpg for sure. It just fits too well.
[0:11:08] <skewerstar> Obviously we're going with either Neutral Spanish or Brazilian Portugese! LUL
[0:11:08] <Solidnick18> become dragon PogChamp
[0:11:09] <metoren> The dub is good, but this is the kind of game to play in its native language. it's part of the experience.
[0:11:11] <Pookiedaexzile> But Mark Hamil tho
[0:11:11] <hassanico2> Judgment had a way worse dub though
[0:11:12] <Prevot> #$PONSORED
[0:11:16] <BlackermanZX> Even if i am a full sub weeb in everything i still like dub a bit more for this game
[0:11:21] <crazy_man185> Pat going 100% dub was legit
[0:11:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lion_kun As much as I love Strikers, Yakuza LAD is just on another level.
[0:11:22] <@Menitta> I really wanna replay Judgment dubbed
[0:11:23] <+BusterRepukken> I go with subs because the dubbed Karoake sucks honestly.
[0:11:23] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Spanish dub PogChamp
[0:11:24] <majindusto> Dub is Good...But Yakuza  is Japanese  through  and through
[0:11:26] <$dudedude55555> i played it dub, it's good
[0:11:27] <felrender> yooooo
[0:11:28] <%Lion_kun> P5S has shown me musou can be fantastic
[0:11:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> Tekken cutscenes are amazing cause fuck you why would they all speak one language
[0:11:31] <@Menitta> That dub seems really good
[0:11:33] <%ChoculaUltra> I even went out to look up other Musou games - its actually wild how many of them DON'T have like RPG/level up mechanics
[0:11:33] <%krispen_wa> man, Kaiji Tang is such a good voice actor
[0:11:34] <%RandoChris> Dragon: Like A Yakuza is great
[0:11:41] <%Asuterisuku> Yakuza is TOO Japanese for me to play Dubbed.
[0:11:50] <%gatorafan> I'm still butthurt FighterZ didn't get a Latino dub
[0:11:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @busterrepukken It sounds like a bunch of non singers doing Karaoke, it is perfect.
[0:11:52] <%Lion_kun> Are there any musou as good as P5S?
[0:11:53] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @captainpiledriver god i wish tekken cutscene tech was in real life
[0:11:54] <crazy_man185> dub karaoke was very memey
[0:11:54] <brian_peppers1> Karaoke sucks in Yakuza 7 period no matter the language
[0:11:55] <YakumoYomi> But George Takei, tho!
[0:11:55] <$dudedude55555> how fast until shogi
[0:11:57] <samazam94> everyone has their preferences, and woolie has made his decision. chill, chat.
[0:11:58] <+PenGia> The dub is really good but I went with Subs and it was fantastic all the way through
[0:11:59] <skewerstar> Serious answer tho... I'm biased towards sub mainly because Pat's already played it with the dub.
[0:12:01] <%holydeviant1> There is a good bit for one side story if you're doing the dub
[0:12:02] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:12:05] <%orcstr16> Although, I can no longer go back to mindless musou now because P5S took that genre to a new level.
[0:12:08] <%Lion_kun> I want to play them.
[0:12:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @Asuterisuku but Hijiyama is in the english dub, tho. Plus, they solved the Osakaben issue
[0:12:14] <DSD24> @Lion_kun Hyrule Warriors is great
[0:12:21] <+SpcOpsBear> this BEAT PogChamp
[0:12:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> I wish I had universal understanding of all language so everyone could speak whatever they wanted
[0:12:27] <%krispen_wa> SourPls
[0:12:29] <%Noonoox12> Yo this beat fucks
[0:12:30] <Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[0:12:30] <nicversus> @Asuterisuku I thought the same thing, but then I played the Yakuza 7 dub and never switched it back
[0:12:36] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:12:37] <%ChoculaUltra> @gatorafan word, Bamco fucked up. Seeing the live reactions of Mexico, Chile, and Spain for the last episode of Dragon Ball Super should've been a greenlight
[0:12:37] <VidulaSaix> The dub is so good
[0:12:40] <SomeOtherNeb> is that some Omikron lyrics I spot in the background
[0:12:41] <BlackermanZX> SourPls
[0:12:45] <TopTierHarley> gwdHitIt
[0:12:46] <%Exiliator> SourPls
[0:12:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie getting into Memphis Phonk now?
[0:12:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Real question, what right does P5 Strikers have to have an OST that I may actually like better than P5R?
[0:12:49] <CappuccinoGuil> The dub is incredible
[0:12:50] <%smyld> Got the stank face to this
[0:12:53] <@Menitta> my problem with Yakuza dubbed is that they use the voice actors for the characters so its jarring when their voice face doesnt sound like their face face
[0:12:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> shofuDance shofuDance shofuDance shofuDance
[0:12:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:13:00] <$serpenttucker> Blur-ry
[0:13:02] <VidulaSaix> I know he plans to swap back and forth but I hope we get more dub than sub cause even the localization is different depending on the version
[0:13:02] <skyentombment> I'll say, since Pat has played through Y7 dubbed, I think it's not a bad idea for Woolo to play subbed, if anything for variety's sake
[0:13:08] <%Noonoox12> woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:13:10] <themememovement> Yakuza 7 is almost a perfect game but its missing one thing
[0:13:10] <TopTierHarley> shofuDance gwdHitIt
[0:13:18] <Blank9> P5 Strikers ost is amazing, Singularity's my favorite song on there and apparently it's done by a composer that's only ever worked on Dynasty Warriors 9.
[0:13:19] <Pookiedaexzile> We gonna get some Oscar Awatd Winning 36 Mafia tracks
[0:13:23] <VidulaSaix> What Pat does shouldn't have any influence on what Woolie does, they're different people
[0:13:23] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta someone other me still references voice-face face-face
[0:13:29] <samazam94> @menitta that makes no sense
[0:13:30] <majindusto> As Good  as the Dub probably  is...I started the games  when  there was ONLY a Sub version...I'm  too far in to change
[0:13:34] <themememovement> Where's Akiyama?
[0:13:35] <%smyld> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:13:35] <%ChoculaUltra> could you guys imagine a complete Yakuza series remaster but as one single game that plays from 0 to 7 LUL
[0:13:37] <Louie_Salmon> @themememovement A card game with all the characters faces on it
[0:13:39] <@Menitta> It's such a good line lmao
[0:13:48] <Solidnick18> @Blank9 they got some of the best remixes.
[0:13:51] <%smyld> Imma need the name for this
[0:13:51] <missingangle> I personally prefer dubbed but mostly because I listen to these streams more often than not cause of work, so it’s just easier on my uncultured ass
[0:13:55] <+Noonoox12> @ChoculaUltra say hello to, what, 300 hours?
[0:13:57] <YakumoYomi> @ChoculaUltra That game would be WAY too long
[0:13:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @blank9 I knew I was in good hands when the first dungeons theme kicked in.
[0:14:00] <Louie_Salmon> @choculaultra A terabyte of cutscene files
[0:14:01] <%Kaito_Cam> Kiryu and ichiban are flavors of badass
[0:14:03] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Well at least Woolie already knows how RPGs work so he doesn’t have to spend a lot of time learning it like Yakuza 0
[0:14:09] <%Asuterisuku> @ChoculaUltra Considering how little Kamurocho changes... It could be done.
[0:14:14] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> The complete yakuza universe on a single disc
[0:14:16] <VidulaSaix> Kaiji is the main reason to do dub
[0:14:17] <+Solutha> I hope they have dub for George Takei parts
[0:14:21] <BinjoMonkey> YEEEEES
[0:14:22] <DSD24> @majindusto I get what you are saying but if its a new cast then I don't mind switching to a dub
[0:14:22] <%gatorafan> @smyld name's next to Kirby

[0:14:26] <%holydeviant1> I want Kiryu and Ichiban to team up and absolutely ruin some motherfucker's day
[0:14:34] <+McSoliace> @Menitta i mean kiryu isn't voiced by the same face ever
[0:14:50] <%holydeviant1> HERE WE GO

[0:25:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's gonna be weeeeird but coolio
[0:25:18] <CureMode_> PRO ZD is also a voice actor in the game
[0:25:19] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackBofe
[0:25:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Curious to see how you'll swap them. Like, between sessions?
[0:25:20] <Solidnick18> but what goes first SeriousSloth
[0:25:23] <Pookiedaexzile> coin flip
[0:25:23] <Kiryurules> Dub is fantastic so this is good
[0:25:23] <DianaTheAscian> how frequent is this alternation?
[0:25:25] <+thesickestzak> MY YAKISOBA PAN
[0:25:25] <+AkronymCLT> I played Japanese so I'm interested to hear the differences
[0:25:26] <TigerClaws12> >telling a weeb to put dub on
[0:25:26] <@Menitta> good solution for how split that poll was
[0:25:31] <%JustToWatch> Start with the dub for George Takei though
[0:25:32] <Darren716> The Dub is legit better
[0:25:34] <+Psitterrific> Yakuza 7, without spoilers feels like a loveletter to jrpgs, yakuza style. I genuinely love it.
[0:25:34] <%Asuterisuku> Pat's described that to him as well.
[0:25:37] <brachydios777> It will be established that Ichi does know what sex is
[0:25:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nah Sub is way better
[0:25:41] <majindusto> Playing  a Yakuza  game  Dubbed enigmaCringe
[0:25:45] <PsychoPearl> Start with dub I suggest
[0:25:45] <+SpcOpsBear> I'm getting a honey BBQ supermelt from Friendly's and can't decide what to drink
[0:25:51] <+ggbhtg> acquire funds
[0:25:51] <missingangle> Do you know how many sessions you’ll be playing Y7?
[0:25:52] <%X2Eliah> Yakisoba like a dragon.
[0:25:55] <tuftecake> thank goodness dubz
[0:25:55] <@akuda_bar> free drinks? free drinks? can't say no to free drinks
[0:25:55] <TigerClaws12> now where's the actual poll? Put it up coward Kappa
[0:25:58] <%Exiliator> Yeah
[0:25:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like a Pockets
[0:25:58] <+RazeEmAll> the dub is real good
[0:25:59] <+SpcOpsBear> Lemonade or iced tea?
[0:26:00] <PsychoPearl> I prefer sub but I like dub
[0:26:02] <ELFucilaNeroIV> SEGA be like 👀
[0:26:04] <Darren716> Start with the dub so you get Takai and Wei Shen
[0:26:04] <%chosenjuan42> WE ALL OK
[0:26:06] <bitterpelican> Both dub and sub are cool, but dub is just easier for English speakers to get it on the ear
[0:26:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> We worry
[0:26:09] <@Menitta> This is great
[0:26:10] <%itschickenscratch> if you ever get the chance to sell out, sell the fuck out

[0:50:59] <NoireRequiem> jelly donut
[0:51:04] <Carlioo> no
[0:51:05] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus no\
[0:51:05] <+shad8snake> no
[0:51:06] <ALTRNico> no one turn at a time
[0:51:06] <%Juriasu> no item takes a turn normally
[0:51:07] <psidefx> nah
[0:51:07] <SomeOtherNeb> no, it's just tutorial things
[0:51:07] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Yakuza now with more George Takei
[0:51:08] <tuftecake> just tutorial
[0:51:08] <+lordericter> nah its tutorial
[0:51:08] <CappuccinoGuil> No, one action epr turn
[0:51:09] <Solidnick18> you can perfect guard
[0:51:09] <enerkaizer> No, you have active guard. Think Mario RPG
[0:51:09] <%X2Eliah> no
[0:51:10] <Saltmeisterr> u can't move
[0:51:10] <+Proxzo> Oh man I love salmon onigiri.
[0:51:13] <+eldrinos> turns are being skipped for tutorial
[0:51:15] <%runegod20> just a tutorial, items takes up turns
[0:51:17] <Pookiedaexzile> 1 action and a Movement
[0:51:24] <%aram909> theres a "speed" stat that determines how many actions a character can do during a turn
[0:51:29] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> This is already the best Paper Mario game of the last ten years.
[0:51:36] <JoshManVGH> It's not a full guard action. The response block is like Paper Mario, reduces damage
[0:51:40] <PsychoPearl> It's December 31, 2000 not 1999. Its gonna be 2001
[0:51:44] <Louie_Salmon> @superbloodwolfmoon It hurts but it's true
[0:51:48] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> If only they had the Stylish moves from Paper Mario
[0:51:50] <+Chronobot> _ _ G A system
[0:51:54] <%Juriasu> @JoshManVGH but there is also a guard action
[0:51:55] <%aram909> characters with high speed can do multiple actions per turn
[0:51:55] <InsomniacPersona> I love that the combat menu is SEGA
[0:51:56] <+FreshlyGratedGinger> paper mario lmal
[0:51:56] <%runegod20> also, I think this is a game where the higher a character's agility is, on top of being higher in the turn order, they also gain turns faster
[0:51:58] <krabsan> @WoolieVersus you could do 2 actions before him cause of your speed
[0:51:58] <%Exiliator> Cool!...?
[0:52:00] <ricky12k1> Wasn’t expecting him to jump to 7

[1:51:04] <Orenjevel> THE TRIPLETS
[1:51:06] <+Yakfan> if you go in to the settings you can turn off the button prompts for everything but defensive moves and you still get all the bonuses as if you hit them perfectly
[1:51:07] <DSD24> Not for the player character which is important
[1:51:10] <+nomad390> Yeah it goes from 60fps to 30fps
[1:51:12] <+eldrinos> big difference here is that physics are more accurate and raytracing are added in in HR
[1:51:12] <Klefth> To think of how easy it is to run this game in 4k on PC, and the PS5 chugs this bad? Jesus...
[1:51:13] <ErazorD_Jim20XX> YOU'RE CLOSE, MA'AM

[2:06:02] <leith_aziz> @CelestialCage: It played with Tachibana (but i cant spoil)
[2:06:05] <+chiazam> WHYYYYYYYY
[2:06:05] <CappuccinoGuil> @runegod20 not quite the "theme of sadness" yet, just his theme.
[2:06:06] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> George Takei is awesome, but he sounds way too old for this role.
[2:06:07] <binaryanomaly16> Pregananat
[2:06:07] <RyuShinden> Man George Takei is phenomenal in this
[2:06:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> but y

[2:06:34] <disflipmat> ESPECIALLY the karaoke
[2:06:35] <SolidusA> soothing voice
[2:06:35] <+RealThiele> murder flex
[2:06:36] <+chiazam> Just because I didn't PIPE YOUR DAUGHTER!?!?!
[2:06:39] <%Asuterisuku> Now, remember how his father died.
[2:06:45] <%paladinstarbuster> What the criminals do crime
[2:06:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Yakuza 7 is actually just the sequel to Yakuza: Arakawa
[2:06:57] <RyuuAoi> And y'all mad at Jo.
[2:06:57] <ErazorD_Jim20XX> Shuuuuuush
[2:07:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Arukawa is Japanese John Wick
[2:07:07] <%runegod20> normally when you hear this story, it's the other way around
[2:07:07] <laserbeaming> so... it's also his son's Birthday?
[2:07:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yakuzas mean business, taking a finger isnt "too much"
[2:07:10] <BoneBagMel> ghost npcs
[2:07:11] <$Kaiser_Loar> welcome to the new song of sadness
[2:07:12] <Prevot> oh god is that why he's in a wheelchair?
[2:07:13] <archie_ns> Yakuza -1 with young Arawaka when
[2:07:13] <%neroforte177> @CappuccinoGuil i'd play the fuck outta that
[2:07:17] <leith_aziz> I played the Dub soley for Kaji Tang's performance, but I found more reason to love it as the game went on
[2:07:17] <DatAsuna> Since 1971
[2:07:18] <RyuShinden> @BallerSwagBro9k He basically is.
[2:07:19] <ghoststalker> C A F E      A L P S
[2:07:21] <+Chronobot> the eternal
[2:07:22] <VidulaSaix> I'd fucking love an Arakawa game
[2:07:22] <StarPupil1> They have the same birthday
[2:07:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Cafe Alps is the key to all of this
[2:07:25] <+Shonen_hero> Jo sucks, regardless of whatever freudian excuse he has for his behavior.
[2:07:26] <KaironFortressKnight> Young Takei = JYB
[2:07:27] <AstrodropGaming> Arakawa already went and had his own Yakuza game

[2:16:06] <Kiryurules> @DzyZ_ paused to do this sponsored look at 7
[2:16:08] <RyuuAoi> Yeah don't spoil guys. For why?
[2:16:12] <+HolePunchLeaf> The light in this game is just YEP

[2:16:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> george takei STUCK
[2:16:17] <Tuna_Can_0> I have no idea what the spoiler is, but thanks for letting me know theres a spoiler around atpRtsd
[2:16:20] <%gatorafan> @dzyz_ just a small detour for SEGA money
[2:16:20] <%krispen_wa> The implication is real. he did John Wick them
[2:16:23] <+Shonen_hero> let's be fair, the map in this game is relatively small for an open world game. That gives them the edge though because they can fill that city with a ton of content
[2:16:23] <DzyZ_> aaah ok. thanks chat
[2:16:23] <Dakuu75> "heavy coffee" sounds like something I wouldn't wanna have unless I was 10 feet away from a toilet

[2:38:00] <neptious> SHAKEDOWN-ISH MUSIC
[2:38:01] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus basic attacks can be blocked. Specials can't
[2:38:01] <CelestialCage> Skills bypass blocks
[2:38:03] <zerointelligence000> blocking only works on basic attacks
[2:38:04] <morningmoondude> Regular attacks can be blocked, not skills
[2:38:06] <Darren716> Special attacks can usually hit whoever, regular attacks can be blocked though
[2:38:07] <+ChubbyPencil> Skills don't get interrupted
[2:38:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bike, Old Faithful
[2:38:10] <+eldrinos> in general special attacks can't be bodyblocked on startup
[2:38:10] <xdeathknightx> no only regular attacks can get blocked
[2:38:12] <Lizard0TM> God the music is so good in this game
[2:38:13] <+MajorCrasher> skills can't be blocked
[2:38:13] <+Yakfan> @WoolieVersus now it's a random roll when you go past someone if they're gonna attack
[2:38:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's just sometimes characters will take a swing if your running to someone behind them
[2:38:15] <pi_in_the_sci> attacks provoke AoOs, skills always work
[2:38:18] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Special moves allow u to run past enemies so they don't hit u
[2:38:22] <+Chronobot> INCONSPICOUS
[2:38:28] <%runegod20> special attacks can't be blocked, but they also don't have the bonus damage from hitting a downed enemy
[2:38:29] <+Shonen_hero> they are pretty snappy
[2:38:34] <%osaka_daioh> yeah its great
[2:38:35] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I just got back. Did they just pause the game for an hour?
[2:38:37] <R3c0n31> so you gotta plan out your attacks using the characters movement
[2:38:43] <+Nekros4442> overall these fights are way faster

[2:38:54] <%krispen_wa> @freakin_wolfy they got in to cutscenes for an hour
[2:38:54] <%Javaa01> Every time you go up a character or job level you get a HP and MP refill
[2:38:57] <AllenDeadman> 1 Int
[2:39:00] <%KenReels> every level up you refresh MP
[2:39:01] <DSD24> That's Ichiban for you!

[2:39:15] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus regular attacks can be stopped by "Attack Of Opportunity" type attacks of enemies between you and your target. Skills ignore that "Attack of Opportunity" thing
[2:39:16] <OkamiDude15> ichiban is the sharpest tool in the shed, but he's got a good heart
[2:39:18] <MyNameIsRasus> It's a shame Woolie hasn't played 1 to see the parallel

[2:44:10] <TheNeonCaster> Wait, this is ProZD? Oh dip!!!!
[2:44:11] <jowi_time> the problem is the power vacuum
[2:44:11] <+Nekros4442> Nope. If Jo takes the fall the entire Arakawa goes down with him.
[2:44:12] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s the captain though, if he admitted to it the whole family would have to pay
[2:44:14] <Neoripo> Sacrifice Jo for profit
[2:44:14] <+MightyDuckShoes> @BusterRepukken  Seriously.
[2:44:15] <R3c0n31> Happy Birthday ichi, Go to prison for a jackass

[2:52:56] <dukenux> that's not... too bad honestly, for a first degree murder
[2:52:58] <+rrratbastard> i meaaaaan it is a civilian killing a ytakuza, so that's pretty okay
[2:53:00] <+strakillias> Prepare for BREAD
[2:53:00] <+HolePunchLeaf> Well I mean Japan still has the death sentence so it could have been way worse
[2:53:01] <JoshManVGH> Almost bread

[2:53:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> but luckily it's Japan
[2:53:08] <Namillus> Japan Justice System
[2:53:11] <ARDM112> Not in Japan though LUL
[2:53:12] <Jonxal> confess is enough in Japan
[2:53:12] <+lordericter> no but this is Japan though
[2:53:12] <@Commando_Joe> Japan has a 99.99% conviction rate
[2:53:12] <+valiard> Ichiban - New Century - Luck=0
[2:53:13] <NotHereToStream> 99%
[2:53:13] <%Asuterisuku> But this is Japan, where if it goes to trial, you're Guilty.
[2:53:15] <+RaveBV> Time to eat some quality bread physics
[2:53:15] <Jalexster> I think boss probably gave you enough details
[2:53:15] <+Das_Prints> I forget how old was Ichi at this point? Was it 22?
[2:53:20] <%neroforte177> or in certain countries he'd be fucking dead
[2:53:20] <laserbeaming> Japan just likes to put people in jail
[2:53:20] <linSP> Everyone knows you’re not guilty but go to jail
[2:53:22] <NeonBleu> 99.9%
[2:53:27] <knackirontarkus> the max outside of a life sentence in Japan is 20 years if I recall correctly
[2:53:28] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Japan's Justice System + Yakuza Affairs.
[2:53:28] <Neoripo> 99.9999999%
[2:53:28] <ulcaban> Ichiban is too good
[2:53:28] <Darren716> Japan doesn't give a fuck, they just want someone. For more info play Judgement!

[2:53:34] <missingangle> But Japan’s justice system sucks, though. Ace Attorney literally parodies it
[2:53:34] <R3c0n31> 99% should be impossible
[2:53:36] <rafflespaddock> Judgment
[2:53:37] <Solidnick18> damn cicada's

[2:53:57] <+Yakfan> @WoolieVersus actually they'd be more strict about it to make sure the case is iron clad for conviction.
[2:53:58] <+chiazam> Yeah people confess to crimes they didn't do A LOT in the US
[2:53:58] <TheLuckyWatcher> if you are accused you are guilty in Japan

[2:54:08] <redrins> cicadas are real
[2:54:11] <+Shonen_hero> listen, that just means they are so good at finding the right people right? THere's no potential for negligence or corruption in a court with a 99% conviction rate. They also *never* force confessions

[3:17:02] <rohan_chan> y’all clearly they didn’t think about that...pretty sure it’s not intentional

[3:18:30] <+Shonen_hero> sometimes life deals you a shit hand and you gotta roll with it. That said, Ichiban's denial is totally understandable

[3:19:05] <dinnydanny777> Ichiban goes through the 5 stages of grief in real time
[3:19:23] <ghoststalker> @mattynezz Majima was kicked out of a Tojo family subsidiary, but he’s being watched over by Sagawa, who is an Omi officer who is a kyodai to his old boss Shimano

[3:20:57] <DedlokPM> @RyuuAoi There really isn't anything spoilery in the first 13 hours. Like, Tojo is gone but not due to anyhing directly related to what happens in the rest of 0 and 1-6. Besides he his making some monry off this.

[3:24:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> CHAT, theyre gonna quick look this for 13 hours.
[3:25:00] <+MusicMondayPodcast> Boss Coffee is VERY REAL and it has so many versions it makes Monster energy a joke on variety

[3:25:08] <%big_laser_boss> Dear God I should move on from 0 to catch up to kiwami 1 2, 6 and this. Such an amazing franchise

[3:25:24] <BrekfastCyborg> lol damn guys those sega bucks got u talking about BREAD PHYSICS
[3:25:25] <nicversus> The bread pretty much looks that good on ps4
[3:25:28] <CelestialCage> BURY THE LIGHT
[3:25:28] <+combat_rock> Turns out man CAN live on bread alone.
[3:25:31] <invader_rin> Close your heart to it
[3:25:33] <Komayeda> So like, is this as far as he's goin' so far?
[3:25:33] <%awpickens> V has not
[3:25:34] <pi_in_the_sci> Alternate?
[3:25:36] <+NopeBadguy> Let that hype propel you through the rest of the series
[3:25:37] <@Menitta> V is only up to Yakuza 4
[3:25:39] <ghoststalker> @torgue_1 no, he hasn’t
[3:25:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @torgue_1 nope they’re both goin in blind
[3:25:40] <TundraOW> How does it feel knowing you'll never taste Kasuga's physics-enabled bread?
[3:25:41] <Lizard0TM> build up the walls, keep them high
[3:25:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> Can we get slow mode off now
[3:25:47] <+SilverDevilfish> Woolie will finish 0, get 2 hours into Kiwami and be like "let's go back to 7"
[3:25:51] <xdeathknightx> @Torgue_1 No, he hasn't
[3:25:51] <Pookiedaexzile> How ya likin Ichi
[3:26:00] <thekorvu> Bruh wut?
[3:26:01] <NotHereToStream> Kasuga ichiban is a breath of fresh air in this series
[3:26:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> Serious Crime Drama remember? Kappa
[3:26:04] <+redux_014> 0-2-7 are my favorite ones
[3:26:05] <%Exiliator> CHOTTO MATTE
[3:26:06] <@Menitta> Arakawa's backstory is the darkest in probably the entire series
[3:26:06] <$emptyantics> Cheer500 FULL LP COMFIRMED?!
[3:26:06] <+SilverInferno3> But can that bread run Arkham Asylum?
[3:26:06] <+rrratbastard> best backstory best protag dont fight me on this
[3:26:07] <spiderously> and how about that dub
[3:26:08] <R3c0n31> The back and forth of Intense and funny is handled so well
[3:26:10] <Afrosamasenpai> CH-CHOTTO
[3:26:11] <Solidnick18> Kudastop
[3:26:11] <%bread_assassin> It's gonna be hard when Woolie switches back and has to wait a couple years to beat 1-6 before he can come play the rest.
[3:26:13] <+BusterRepukken> @Livelinne who is John
[3:26:13] <daniphofani> CHOTTO MATTE
[3:26:15] <yssarilrock> Yakuza 4 has the best pre-Ichi PC: Shun Akiyama
[3:26:21] <%Noonoox12> Are we stopping for today, or just pausing?
[3:26:28] <+eldrinos> yeah this game takes a lot of notes from persona 5 in terms of QOL
[3:26:28] <cumurasame> I love Kiryu but Ichiban is soooo good at expressing himself
[3:26:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> Ichibans tits in the reflection
[3:26:29] <astrophizz> same as dragon quest
[3:26:34] <%gatorafan> QoL Kreygasm
[3:26:38] <%runegod20> i never like using auto heal items, I want to choose what healing items get used manually rather than it being random
[3:26:41] <%Asuterisuku> Serious Crime Drama (tm)
[3:26:43] <+rusttyphoon> Chotto a minute
[3:26:44] <Namillus> @WoolieVersus The combat menu is Skills, Etc., Guard and Attack... or S.E.G.A.
[3:26:45] <Jashter18> Akiyama being the GOAT is free

[3:26:59] <%Livelinne> @busterrepukken Eyepatch Wolf woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:27:14] <Tardispardis> Change to sub next week?
[3:27:17] <Kiryurules> HE IS A GOOD BOY
[3:27:17] <TheCrispyBoi> he da best]
[3:27:17] <@Menitta> @runegod20 In Y7, it uses your party's healing moves and it prioritizes any party member not in your current crew
[3:27:18] <prime_name> Characters make or break a story
[3:27:20] <@Menitta> Its pretty nice
[3:27:22] <+MidnightBurst12> the real horseporn experience
[3:27:22] <+Shonen_hero> Ichiban is seriously a good follow up to Kiryu.
[3:27:29] <+McSoliace> there are so many likeable characters in this game
[3:27:31] <PsychoPearl> Gonna check sub for next stream?
[3:27:37] <+NopeBadguy> One of my favorite things I've heard is that Yakuza is like the Sopranos occasionally punctuated by an episode of the Simpsons.
[3:27:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theyre alternating subs and dubs
[3:27:44] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s way more proactive than reactive
[3:27:46] <Karego_at> sub next time ?
[3:27:51] <%Double_Tap_That> OH BOY is there racing
[3:27:54] <fIashman92> Kiryu is a force of nature
[3:27:56] <%X2Eliah> Racing, you say?
[3:27:57] <xdeathknightx> BEWARE, the auto heal will use items and will decide for itself which items it deems best to use
[3:28:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie, how you like Mario Kart?
[3:28:06] <Darren716> Man I hope Woolie plays enough to get to the kart

[3:28:08] <R3c0n31> Ichis ghost is hovering over V with intensity
[3:28:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Ichi Matches the world
[3:28:17] <Komayeda> I mean, Ichiban's also kinda that way in substories, but he's got lotsa initiative in the main story
[3:28:18] <Djinnazz> He'd have been one of the grunts Kiryu would beat up on.
[3:28:26] <%kullumanati> I’m so glad they dubbed it.
[3:28:27] <+BusterRepukken> @Livelinne ah so hes just a mad kiryu fanboy
[3:28:28] <cumurasame> @yssarilrock I'd say Shinada Tatsuo is more of the proto Ichiban
[3:28:29] <PrideOfFiddles> Really, really looking forward to the next stream :D
[3:28:34] <Mattais88> How bout that dub Ichi, too?
[3:28:35] <@Menitta> Ichiban has a big "Sir, this is a Wendy's" vibe
[3:28:37] <fatshadowz> GOTY for me
[3:28:39] <+Cuon_Alpinus> LUL
[3:28:40] <mortificent> Chotto
[3:28:40] <TheNeonCaster> TY for streaming! Oh yeah; where did V say he got his masks from again?
[3:28:40] <+Sword_of_Stupid> Ready for the next one
[3:28:42] <+Stoogeish> There's a big power gap between 0, 5, 6, 7 and the rest of the yakoozies
[3:28:42] <DSD24> The dub is so good too
[3:28:43] <%Asuterisuku> 3 hours and we don't even have our first party member yet.
[3:28:44] <Kyoshikei> CHOTTOMATTE

[3:28:58] <Tracazoid> Luckily I'm just as blind

[3:29:01] <+xerotwo> C H O T T O
[3:29:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> just put chat into emote only mode during next stream
[3:29:02] <passserby> can't wait for the english karaoke
[3:29:03] <wibbwobbler> this is pretty lit so far !
[3:29:03] <Afrosamasenpai> You mean hammers aren't subtle?
[3:29:03] <@Menitta> Maybe baby jail next time
[3:29:03] <%jonblnt> Such a good dub
[3:29:04] <+HolePunchLeaf> "Wow, I can't wait for this next part,, RIGHT GUYS???" :^)
[3:29:10] <RyuuAoi> Stop. You're not cool
[3:29:16] <+ggbhtg> but if I joke about an incoming spoiler, you won't get it!!!!!!! FailFish
[3:29:17] <Klefth> I honestly prefer dub Kasuga over JP Kasuga
[3:29:19] <BabblingBayou> That dub is pretty good ngl
[3:29:20] <%Exiliator> It's "alright", but I don't see the "AMAZING" so far
[3:29:22] <jorniev> CHAT BE LIKE: better not get used to him huehuehuehuehahahaagh-
[3:29:25] <MaddyCaddy> I played this on sub and I'm pretty sure the translation is different from the dub which is pretty neat
[3:29:31] <DedlokPM> @runegod20 once you have heal skills it will auto-use them. Eventually you will have enough stats and mp where the auto-heal stuff will not be taxing at all.
[3:29:32] <PsychoPearl> Will you do the sub for next stream?
[3:29:33] <Tardispardis> It's just ok so far imo
[3:29:33] <Clundy> The dub is surprisingly A+
[3:29:36] <%gatorafan> That lipsync tho, I love to see it!
[3:29:49] <%Mrbaconator> george takei FUCKIN KILLS IT
[3:29:53] <PortableBoredom> Did bread happen
[3:29:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:30:07] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I think that be good to switch every session
[3:30:10] <%notsoy> they specifically re-did the lip sync for the english audio and it fucking rocks
[3:30:13] <ghoststalker> Yeah, the dub cast was very good
[3:30:16] <Darren716> Next session is fine in Japanese, we got to hear the two characters I wanted you to hear in English
[3:30:17] <@Menitta> Judgment had that problem too. I'm glad they were able to lip sync this one for dub
[3:30:21] <NotHereToStream> ff7r had lipsync tech
[3:30:22] <@Solidus_113> Sync AI
[3:30:23] <%Double_Tap_That> @PortableBoredom Yes
[3:30:24] <Jnkolm> That was Judgement's issue. lipsynch was way off
[3:30:30] <fIashman92> Don't forget the amazing DOUBLE translated subtitles
[3:30:35] <fritz_dacat> woolieMIRINperfect
[3:30:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Forbidden Bread Tech
[3:30:41] <@Menitta> It was only for pre rendered cutscenes but man it was jarring
[3:30:43] <Prevot> english speakers are super spoiled with this lip sync shit, no place in the world gets things lyp synced in their dubs
[3:30:53] <Solidnick18> They got that shit on lock
[3:30:54] <Kyoshikei> Did someone clip the bread tech?
[3:30:55] <frostyjay3> the BREAD PULL
[3:31:01] <Ner234> Bangers SourPls
[3:31:02] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus The Sub in this game also has a slightly different script as well. Some of the lines are just outright different. Check out the beginning on Youtube in JP if you wanna see what I mean
[3:31:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Just throwing it out there - Like A Dragon is on sale for Steam on Fanatical for the next 13 or so days.

[3:31:14] <%jiggy_snipe> Yakuza OSTs are always good

[3:31:17] <mortificent> THERE'S MUSIC SPOILERS V
[3:31:18] <+McSoliace> the next main song is a Banger
[3:31:18] <@Menitta> be careful for the soundtrack because some of the titles are straight spoilers
