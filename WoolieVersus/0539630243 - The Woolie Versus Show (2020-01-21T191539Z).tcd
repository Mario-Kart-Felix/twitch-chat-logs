[0:04:33] <+Ryu_R> oop
[0:04:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:04:37] <%DesertPenguin> Hey, how come Woolie's streams are in 720p when Pat's are 1080p? And Woolie has copyright issues with the music but Pat didn't when he streamed this
[0:04:41] <+Superbro64> Engagement PogChamp
[0:04:50] <+ggbhtg> A L G O R I T H M
[0:04:55] <+VidulaSaix> Because he streams in 720p?
[0:05:02] <@Solidus_113> internet speeds
[0:05:05] <+linSP> Pog
[0:05:09] <+locutus_of_the_porg> they don't want woolie to win charlsMURDER2
[0:05:21] <%DesertPenguin> That's so silly. You'd think Woolie has better internet since it's kind of his job lol
[0:05:28] <thesickestzak> joltzMicro
[0:05:30] <+VidulaSaix> That's not how internet works my dude
[0:05:42] <augustine321> Woolielivesmatter#
[0:05:42] <%DesertPenguin> I mean he'd pay for better internet because it's a priority for work
[0:05:52] <+VidulaSaix> It has nothing to do with paying for it
[0:05:55] <~WoolieVersus> My bitrate is 3500
[0:05:58] <+VidulaSaix> Sometimes it's just not in your area
[0:06:05] <+Superbro64> oh dear LUL
[0:06:10] <+Superbro64> Hi wools
[0:06:13] <+PeanutJesus> Woolie you must use the arrow to turn your internet into Internet Requiem
[0:06:13] <artoflec> hello o/
[0:06:42] <%DesertPenguin> Yo Woolie, I remember when Pat was talking about his upgrade, you're not on the same ISP as him. I forget, is it not available where you're at? Either way my eyes are crap so 720 looks good enough lol
[0:06:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:06:51] <@Solidus_113> Also, back when Woolie tried 1080p streams for Sekiro there were always a handful of dropped frames every stream
[0:06:51] <+Superbro64> woolie sacrificed 720p in order to master the power of ping crimson
[0:07:03] <+Superbro64> a reasonable trade all things considered
[0:07:12] <+locutus_of_the_porg> human eyes can't see above 720p anyway charlsPRIDE
[0:07:13] <+VidulaSaix> 720's more than fine. Never had any issue seeing anything
[0:07:13] <thesickestzak> “Stadia works for me so it should work for everyone” that guy probably
[0:07:15] <~WoolieVersus> I can crank it to 4500 and see whahappen
[0:07:21] <%DesertPenguin> Yea no worries. I just won't put my glasses on. The slight blur of my eyes softens the edges of polygons LMFAO
