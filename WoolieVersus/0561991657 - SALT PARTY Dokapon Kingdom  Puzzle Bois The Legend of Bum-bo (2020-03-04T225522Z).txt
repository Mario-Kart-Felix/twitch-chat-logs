[0:05:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[0:05:25] <+OnlyNumber1> Welcome to the end of Woolie Versus
[0:05:29] <+BigBruthaThunda> I'm interested in your lack of interest
[0:05:30] <%kjsandwich> Cool Kirby Light
[0:05:38] <+magiclottie> Woolie for your own sanity, do a practice round and then have a walkthrough if you ever play this again. Dokapon is MEAN
[0:05:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @xzilegaming Who survives tonight?
[0:05:43] <BigNerdSam> Woolie should do a Gon in 60 Seconds for Twin Peaks.
[0:05:45] <Prevot> I watched that LP and I didn't like the game OR the LP, don't @ me
[0:06:04] <damienlunas> The answer is "Kaaa chiiipu..."
[0:06:18] <MyNameIsRasus> And that's horrible
[0:06:18] <XzileGaming> @BallerSwagBro9k the video section, we'll always have the memories
[0:06:19] <%RioGascar> Its...not a good game
[0:06:25] <+zegoodknight> I love playing this game with friends xD
[0:06:31] <Laecerelius> What about the football murders?
[0:06:32] <Solidnick18> it's a janky game
[0:06:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So much Great Woolie Lore
[0:06:39] <zenith0111> I made my friends hate this game LUL
[0:06:47] <%commsquirrel> I love this game
[0:06:50] <+Nathillon> Oh this is gonna be good.
[0:06:59] <%kjsandwich> Great Cutscenes but you have A LOT of boring and terrible gameplay to sit through to get them.
[0:07:01] <%RioGascar> when minh was billy
[0:07:05] <+zegoodknight> Play as a team... or play like you're playing mario party xD
[0:07:06] <Dhurkst> @RioGascar Depends on what you're looking for from it. The writing is actually great.
[0:07:07] <BigNerdSam> Woolie the Liar Steals my Pie while Minh Falls Asleep Driving at 200 Miles Per Hour ASMR
[0:07:15] <+DrPoxx> Minh’s lore is that he isn’t real. He is a PTSD hallucination of Reggie and Woolie
[0:07:31] <%kjsandwich> With that said I’m so excited for DP2
[0:07:43] <islandoasis> billy blasting smash bros music when he should have been blasting Initial D music when driving
[0:07:48] <C24U> SOLID LORE
[0:07:48] <%RioGascar> So i played a lot lot more vr games that are not polished
[0:07:50] <%RioGascar> And boy
[0:07:58] <%RioGascar> not having comfort cages hurts me actually
[0:07:58] <RaidenKyrielight> It was Matt
[0:08:04] <+BigBruthaThunda> yeah, just a rumor, unlike the woolie hole
[0:08:08] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Are you going to tell us next that you CAN read?
[0:08:11] <XzileGaming> but you did steal alot of pies though, right
[0:08:17] <MyNameIsRasus> ...but you DID kill that guy, right?
[0:08:29] <ShmowzowKapow> the woolie hole
[0:08:29] <DracaenaLeaf> Woolie hole
[0:08:35] <+pkmamsters> Two Best Friends play was built on the idea of "The Ones Who Walk Away from Woolie"
[0:08:38] <@Solidus_113> It's like playing games during a long drive, you'll get carsick pretty quick if you just focus on the game
[0:08:38] <islandoasis> but you were best friends with liam in the office right?
[0:08:39] <C24U> Throw Woolie into the hole
[0:08:40] <+zegoodknight> The pie stealer
[0:08:40] <%theredherring1996> oh no
[0:08:41] <Solidnick18> i miss the woolie hole
[0:08:47] <%theredherring1996> theredherring1996 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:08:47] <%SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[0:08:51] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[0:08:54] <%generalve> the hole woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[0:08:54] <Solidnick18> it was your apartment
[0:08:55] <damienlunas> Kind of both at once
[0:08:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BOTH
[0:08:56] <clockworkidiot> "let's find a bus to throw woolie under"
[0:08:56] <Nekros4442> The Woolie hole is the deepest lore
[0:08:56] <%The_Timo> Little bit of both Lol
[0:08:57] <%RioGascar> I mean for the longest time I thought when pat talked he was matt and when matt talked he was pat
[0:08:58] <Electro96> all of the above
[0:09:01] <%kjsandwich> God bless the hole
[0:09:02] <Dhurkst> @WoolieVersus DP is legitimately a very polarizing game, that's fine.
[0:09:05] <D00D64> the nebulous zone of which Woolie occurs
[0:09:05] <XzileGaming> psaSmug psaSmug psaSmug
[0:09:07] <+OnlyNumber1> @WoolieVersus Who's gonna throw the first punch tonight?
[0:09:07] <+BigBruthaThunda> IT was the woolie hole in the abstract
[0:09:19] <%The_Timo> I'm sure the Woolie hole lies beneath those trashbags in the intro
[0:09:20] <@Solidus_113> It's not a good game
[0:09:23] <+magiclottie> @WoolieVersus dont play games you dont feel you will enjoy, play what makes you happy
[0:09:33] <LeaIsChill> It's a bad game and a bad thing to play. It's just THAT kind of game
[0:09:42] <zenith0111> You're not missing anything unless you're apart of the niche
[0:09:43] <%RioGascar> its not, sure the writing might be fun. But as game. Bad
[0:09:55] <Solidnick18> we good
[0:10:03] <+vestiphobe> yall saying play what makes you happy but then these dudes about to play dokapon kingdom
[0:10:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> DID HE SAY CONNECTION
[0:10:26] <%Wool> bruh this stream is gonna be absolutely hilarious or absolute shit
[0:10:34] <snowmanie> oh right, Mystery Box was a thing
[0:10:34] <@Solidus_113> It was a mcdonalds pie that he won fairly
[0:10:37] <%Wool> there's no in between for Dokapon
[0:10:40] <+Coolkevinator> my favorite mystery box is still animorphs
[0:10:46] <speximillian> Woolie no you fool
[0:10:47] <+Coolkevinator> skittles is a close second
[0:10:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Three year old cheesecake, for instance
[0:10:54] <speximillian> This is the ultimate salt party game
[0:11:10] <%theredherring1996> who's idea was it to play this
[0:11:19] <zenith0111> Mine :)
[0:11:26] <Zayasu> no mine :)
[0:11:28] <+chaumiester> ..... Have you other 2 guys never had the terrible pies from McD's?
[0:11:33] <Zedimonx5> @theredherring1996 my guess in Minh’s
[0:11:38] <XzileGaming> this sounds like blatant lying
[0:11:39] <DracaenaLeaf> THIEF
[0:11:43] <%kjsandwich> Dokapon is a shitstorm if you don’t know how to play
[0:11:46] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:11:46] <%SirGO0SE> fuckin W
[0:11:48] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:11:50] <XzileGaming> blatant lying
[0:11:50] <brobsaurus> theft
[0:11:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIES
[0:11:52] <ShinMaddrox> Mario Party is to end friendships. Dokapon Kingdom is to make enemies.
[0:11:53] <%tearfuldevil> lies
[0:11:55] <Solidnick18> that's not stealing what
[0:11:55] <%tearfuldevil> thief
[0:12:01] <Dhurkst> @LeaIsChill It's great if you can look past the jank, but it's very understandable when people can't.
[0:12:03] <+gustavozxd> OH MY GOD THEY'RE dOING IT
[0:12:03] <C24U> Did you cheat?
[0:12:04] <Omnislash195> The greatest of crimes

[0:12:05] <MyNameIsRasus> L I A R
[0:12:09] <rubbishbinge> that's robbery
[0:12:11] <speximillian> One game of Dokapon can last as long as an actual JRPG...this might be a multi-part stream
[0:12:12] <Heartless_01> lmao
[0:12:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SBF WOOLIE LORE IS THE REAL TRUTH
[0:12:18] <+BigBruthaThunda> Legend of big boss vs the truth of big boss

[0:12:19] <+gustavozxd> holy shit I didn't know I'm so damn hyped rn
[0:12:20] <brobsaurus> the thief sitting here in his nice couch, that he probably stole, lying about his history of theft
[0:12:23] <D00D64> so woolie tricked someone into losing Rock Paper Scissors with his amazing lying powers of deciet
[0:12:27] <BigNerdSam> Woolie, where does your Neo Geo had end and your dreads begin today?

[0:20:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Big Cry Energy
[0:20:53] <%tearfuldevil> @lemon_lore queebs like burning stuff
[0:21:05] <+Coolkevinator> good fucking luck doing that these days
[0:21:36] <Xeno351> shows are also generally much better so you don't have like 3 good ones a season
[0:21:37] <clockworkidiot> I'm five years into college when the fuck does this time happen?
[0:21:43] <+marsantas> Yeah a lot of trash comes out each season now
[0:21:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOLF IS ALIVE? PogChamp
[0:21:44] <Dhurkst> @zenith0111 Somali & the Forest Spirit? What?
[0:21:48] <+pkmamsters> Woolie calls out Anitubers
[0:21:53] <+Coolkevinator> you have to curate a lot of the trash
[0:21:54] <%RioGascar> Its impossible to watch everything of one medium
[0:21:58] <C24U> I thought Eyepatch Wolf only watched Hunter X Hunter
[0:21:59] <%RioGascar> Its just impossible
[0:22:09] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus Jedd used to, emphasis on used to, have a show where he literally did that - reviewed every new show of the season
[0:22:10] <zenith0111> @dhurkst That's how someone who loved it described it XD
[0:22:13] <%tearfuldevil> jeff
[0:22:33] <Dhurkst> @zenith0111 Oookaaay... XD
[0:22:42] <+zegoodknight> what was it called again?
[0:22:54] <zenith0111> @dhurkst Never checked it myself to confirm
[0:22:57] <@Solidus_113> penicillin
[0:23:01] <+zegoodknight> thanks!
[0:23:26] <damienlunas> OH I thought he said "Served over Rice" and I was like what the fuck
[0:23:47] <%RioGascar> This described makes me wonder how the fuck they came up with this mix
[0:24:00] <Nekros4442> Just gonna say. Your bits in Gon in 60 Seconds are getting fucking amazing dude
[0:24:11] <Dhurkst> @zenith0111 It's the last way I would describe it. It's more chill, relaxing, cute stuff in a super-cool fantasy world
[0:24:27] <LeaIsChill> pls do fan expo this year in toronto
[0:24:33] <islandoasis> waitng for eyepatch wolf to kick the door down and turn this into a 4 player dokapon session
[0:24:40] <%RioGascar> Probably for the best woolie with flu season and then current...world events going on
[0:24:41] <islandoasis> after a episode of HxH of course
[0:24:54] <+zegoodknight> Are you guys playing the story mode?
[0:24:55] <zenith0111> @dhurkst Isn't about some girl stumbling into a magical forest and golem that gets fed up with her ignorance of his land?

[0:25:38] <$JobbedBone> the party
[0:25:44] <Dhurkst> @zenith0111 Fed up with her ignorance? No, he becomes her foster father & legitimately loves her.
[0:25:47] <+zegoodknight> if they're going through a story mode its gonna take a long time to complete
[0:25:49] <MyNameIsRasus> BETTING START

[0:26:21] <SideChar> i would like to see them do the whole run, but it is long as hell
[0:26:25] <OldManDeckardCain> as long as you guys don't include an AI this will be fun
[0:26:26] <+Jhylla81> Oh god. Dokapon Kingdom? I thin someone is gonna get murdered. This game isn't just a friendship ender. It's a life ender.

[0:26:50] <+vestiphobe> @Deadmanslegacy it's mario party but turned to 11 multiple times
[0:26:51] <D00D64> given that this is a multiplayer RPG with woolie, be prepared for this to be Part 1 of 234
[0:26:54] <+magiclottie> @Deadmanslegacy a game with more salt than any mario party in existence
[0:26:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Minh looking minh t FRESH

[0:27:01] <%SirGO0SE> M(inh)VP
[0:27:04] <Hellarussian> is Dokapon more brutal than Mario Party?
[0:27:04] <Deadmanslegacy> @fenixseraph "salt genre", 😂😂😂

[0:27:29] <Hellarussian> oh no
[0:27:36] <Deadmanslegacy> @nin10play lul
[0:27:37] <GeltonZ> @Deadmanslegacy It's often called "The Friendship Ending Game". It is a full length RPG in board game format. A game lasts 40 hours.
[0:27:45] <a_mad_dragon> no sound?
[0:27:45] <+Jhylla81> Dokapon Kingdom is the Dark Souls of Party games
[0:27:50] <+magiclottie> 40 hours minimum @GeltonZ
[0:27:57] <Deadmanslegacy> 😂😂😂 good to know
[0:27:58] <zenith0111> YE YE YE YE
[0:28:01] <Solidnick18> Tense?
[0:28:05] <%Wool> YEYEYEYE

[0:28:08] <WG101> no it's not
[0:28:08] <OldManDeckardCain> there's a battle mode that's shorter
[0:28:12] <Solidnick18> This what the people wanted
[0:28:17] <nin10play> Friendships will no overcome Dokapon
[0:28:17] <%RioGascar> Huh atlus
[0:28:17] <%Wool> Minh is gonna fucking get banned from the house
[0:28:18] <Deadmanslegacy> nice Simpson's opening

[0:28:19] <+KENTASHIRO> No friends here, just Minh
[0:28:23] <zenith0111> MY BODY IS READY
[0:28:27] <Redblood801> Will this game end the channel?
[0:28:27] <D00D64> wait, Sting? They made that strategy game with the bullet dodge mechanics?
[0:28:29] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:28:30] <+Aztec50> Is this a salt party?
[0:28:30] <Triplicat> 💦
[0:28:31] <WG101> within the realm of dokapon's divinity
[0:28:31] <%RioGascar> IT IS BUSINESS HERE

[0:28:34] <kingkeldeo31> War never changes
[0:28:37] <Solidnick18> This is big salt party
[0:28:37] <Zayasu> WoolieVersus (FINAL)

[0:29:02] <+Aztec50> oh my
[0:29:05] <+magiclottie> it took The Runaway Guys years to beat this
[0:29:12] <+magiclottie> and there was GENUINE anger at times
[0:29:14] <+KENTASHIRO> Losing isn't winning in Dokapon like it is in Mario
[0:29:16] <GeltonZ> This is less Mario Party and more RPG in board game format.
[0:29:17] <+Coolkevinator> YUP
[0:29:23] <OldManDeckardCain> you can force other players to have poop as hair if you kill them
[0:29:24] <+FadingEmber> Stonks will be had

[0:29:40] <Redblood801> I can't believe Woolie wants to end the channel this soon
[0:29:43] <speximillian> This game doesn’t have a comeback factor like Mario Party
[0:29:45] <sonicblade38> this game ALSO has hidden classes kuz why NOT
[0:29:45] <D00D64> Get ready to see some progress RISE and FALL
[0:29:46] <GeltonZ> @GaimDS It is a full length RPG

[0:39:11] <Solidnick18> oh god
[0:39:18] <nin10play> @TheGamerMaldito No teams unless they agree to work together. Red is girl character, Blue is boy character
[0:39:21] <Zayasu> minh is the rock
[0:39:21] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie is Kevin Hart
[0:39:22] <Redblood801> What could possibly go wrong?

[0:39:42] <crossing_mao> “Don’t worry about it” Joe flashback intensifies
[0:39:54] <HairyRavioliToad> when I try to roll my R it sounds like a Japanese R
[0:39:55] <DXLelouch24> So 21 turns
[0:39:58] <+Goku01899> Dokapon kingdom can last a long time. It’s super funny with friends though.
[0:40:06] <YakumoYomi> Time for some Dokapon brand sodium.
[0:40:06] <GeltonZ> Don't worry about timing. All of the rolls are determined before the game starts so you can't save scum.

[0:42:29] <GeltonZ> Uh oh. That's VERY bad.
[0:42:44] <GeltonZ> Basically Minh can't play as his buttons do not match the actions.
[0:42:45] <%RioGascar> Is this literally
[0:42:52] <%RioGascar> 1 turn of combat
[0:42:53] <islandoasis> minh dropping into a lvl 6 fight at lvl 1
[0:42:55] <%RioGascar> Per turn
[0:42:59] <Make_me_mad> Messing up the controls to give himself a better start? Classic Woolie.
[0:43:00] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think any of their buttons match
[0:43:03] <Redblood801> Woolie has already sabotage Minh

[0:45:23] <%RioGascar> Fgc rap seems like a genre that is under utilized
[0:45:33] <nin10play> @RioGascar I don't necessarily see how it's a bad idea, the point of the game is kinda to backstab your other players so 1 battle action per turn makes it so that you can beat them when they are weakened by others for your own benfit
[0:45:36] <RTM771993> fuk chat ??? LUL

[0:50:18] <SlappyMeats> the thumb up the ass is purely optional
[0:50:21] <GeltonZ> Man I hope someone gets fucked over enough to sell their soul.
[0:50:22] <Hammatime8> Oh god, does poison PERSIST AFTER THE BATTLE!?
[0:50:25] <%RioGascar> @dhurkst My issue is how it just puts good rpgs pacing to halt. sometimes the combat is fun, but a lot of it turns into min maxing and breaking the game in half
[0:50:45] <nin10play> @Hammatime8 Yup. Need to use an antidote, visit a church or the castle
[0:50:53] <Prevot> totally simple and not confusing at all

[1:56:19] <@Solidus_113> Inject a weed
[1:56:20] <CalderGaming> it's a meme
[1:56:22] <redrins> a needle you use to inject weed
[1:56:23] <+powercrasher2> On eBay
[1:56:23] <King_Wolf_Rigger> only the hardest weed needle
[1:56:23] <Tooniearcade> sipsipHonk
[1:56:25] <%jillpilled> it's not real?
[1:56:25] <%GinAndRoses> it's how you inject your weed'
[1:56:27] <SomeSageAdvice> remember the Weed Podcast
[1:56:28] <%jillpilled> I think
[1:56:28] <+CJett92> its used to inject your weeds
[1:56:28] <+PhillipChanter> didn't pat mention the weed needle?
[1:56:30] <$Noponiz> A WEEDLE?
[1:56:30] <zmuno> woolieGASM_TK

[1:56:39] <+JackMillerTime> you can get a concentrate
[1:56:39] <CalderGaming> wait it's NOT a meme?!
[1:56:40] <+ArcanumArcanum> The weed needle is for injecting the marijuana
[1:56:42] <popcultureaficionado> you talked about it on the podcast
[1:56:43] <zenith0111> YOU DON'T SHOOT YOURSELF UP
[1:56:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone doesn't watch the podcast
[1:56:44] <TigerClaws12> WutFace
[1:56:44] <SomeSageAdvice> you actually talked about it on the Podcast
[1:56:45] <bear_breaker20> 'needles of weed"
[1:56:46] <goose_attack_almanac> Don't worry, we all got to see that Reggie's worth as an adventurer was not worth the investment.
[1:56:49] <+EternalJedi> syringe =/= needlke
[1:56:50] <heartlesshealer> YES
[1:56:50] <+eanscrale> It is a meme, but it is real for some reason

[1:57:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I saw it.
[1:57:03] <clockworkidiot> it's mostly a joke about old anti-weed propaganda
[1:57:04] <%jillpilled> EQUAL TO POOP is a title I want
[1:57:05] <LoneFonte> reggie = poop
[1:57:05] <+BigBruthaThunda> "I've never heard of this, but let me tell you about it"
[1:57:06] <+EternalJedi> needles are needles, syringe is the part that holds the stuff
[1:57:07] <Zedimonx5> A weedle Jebaited
[1:57:12] <Dhurkst> weed needle: weedle
[1:57:17] <goose_attack_almanac> Coulda been worse
[1:57:18] <%Ecchigun> what we playin?
[1:57:18] <%SirGO0SE> Kappa500 Hypothetically speaking - Stockings, thigh highs, sandals, or bare?
[1:57:20] <+TheGamerMaldito> Yeah, syringes are not needles!
[1:57:22] <+Jhylla81> Only way Reggie being the poop would be even funnier is if he had the poop haircut
[1:57:24] <lotharrio> Weed needle is based on shit Pat said like 8 years ago, about "injecting a weed."

[3:36:20] <+KENTASHIRO> The Racist always wins
[3:36:22] <islandoasis> there is a way, leave the satrting area already
[3:36:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE/
[3:36:24] <+purplehermit12> @RioGascar it would've been better to just do story mode instead of starting everyone at 30
[3:36:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Racism is too powerful to defeat
[3:36:26] <Slimeking_Mike> We can all agree racism was the best
[3:36:27] <lotharrio> Reggie, start that magic blasting
[3:36:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RACISM WINS AGAIN

[3:36:55] <Darren716> Woolie the only better weapons are on the other side of the contenent

[3:37:17] <@Solidus_113> battle royale was a mistake
[3:37:18] <%jiggy_snipe> should have done this at a lower level
[3:37:20] <%wolfofsound> easier to let the racist win
[3:37:20] <%RioGascar> this games a bit of a slog if levels are too high it seems
[3:37:22] <stormhawk9891> COWARDS
[3:37:22] <SuperKirby24> JUST QUIT

[3:37:31] <nothuzad> p much
[3:37:31] <%jiggy_snipe> yea it's good, you should stop
[3:37:32] <%Wool> you should have just done the first 2 chapters of Story Mode
[3:37:33] <SheefEatsBeef> thank you
[3:37:34] <redrins> shoulda done story mode
[3:37:36] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah
[3:37:37] <%jillpilled> Still fun! But yeah
[3:37:37] <Darren716> Yeah because its a random side mode lol
[3:37:39] <kingkeldeo31> We did it boys, we broke woolie
[3:37:40] <%yeknomlive> story mode is easily the best way to play the game
[3:37:40] <+marsantas> Only money matches are hype!
[3:37:41] <Triplicat> story mode LP incoming
[3:37:41] <gordieda20> should have done story
[3:37:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh well
[3:37:45] <Laveyrin> doodStare doodStare doodStare
[3:37:48] <zenith0111> FULL LP
[3:37:49] <SuperKirby24> RACISM WINS?
[3:37:55] <MyNameIsRasus> THE RACIST WINS
[3:37:56] <+Jhylla81> The true salt was from bordom
[3:37:58] <heartlesshealer> story mode is better than kill count
[3:37:59] <%StaceMcGate> @WoolieVersus might of been better at lvl 1
[3:38:02] <hntronium> THE RACIST REIGNS SUPREME
[3:38:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Racism always wins...
[3:38:05] <heartlesshealer> but yeah, magic's gone tonight
[3:38:07] <AutolycusLive> Story is outright the most entertaining mode. And more focused as a learning experience
[3:38:08] <gade177> What a JRPG where you have to grind? No way!
[3:38:09] <LoneFonte> i guess its time for the FULL LP
[3:38:10] <%yeknomlive> that's the problem with battle royale is the whole map is open. story mode paces it per zone
[3:38:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie's twitter is still cursed and the best pop-offs are there too
[3:38:17] <4skore> RACISM WINS AGAIN
[3:38:18] <+Magick_Man> @WoolieVersus Story mode is best mode.
[3:38:19] <%yeknomlive> and has objectives
[3:38:28] <islandoasis> you actiavely avoided the recommended mode you idoits
[3:38:31] <crossing_mao> FULL LP
[3:38:32] <Triplicat> i swear to god if that killed woolie's interest in the game NotLikeThis
[3:38:36] <gordieda20> Story had Actual objectives
[3:38:38] <SolquidSnake> Story is absolutley the way to go
[3:38:43] <%RioGascar> story mode sounds like a bad idea
[3:38:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[3:38:46] <+KENTASHIRO> It's the right call Woolz
[3:38:47] <damienlunas> NO COWARDICE HERE
[3:38:47] <SheefEatsBeef> nah that game mode sucks balls
[3:38:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> smart decision
[3:38:47] <%RioGascar> Cause its not a lp
[3:38:49] <%StaceMcGate> @WoolieVersus the game is fun, but races are not well suited to LP
[3:38:49] <MyNameIsRasus> NOT COWARDS
[3:38:50] <lotharrio> Woolie rolled over and let the Racist won.
[3:38:52] <Darren716> Coward for not doing storymode
[3:38:52] <heartlesshealer> Never played the intended way
[3:38:53] <BreakersAweigh> its the right call
[3:38:55] <damienlunas> ONE GUY
[3:38:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> BIG HEROES
[3:38:56] <Laveyrin> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[3:38:58] <gade177> Well the game seems boring.

[3:39:05] <+VanaSkiller> psa1guy
[3:39:08] <goose_attack_almanac> Its like playing Monopoly.
[3:39:08] <GeltonZ> You're right. You should wait for another day for a Full LP! :D
[3:39:09] <Damie904> Yea shit got boring after a while. All good Wools
[3:39:11] <+TheGamerMaldito> Yeah, the other gamemode was a lot better, sometimes this happens :D

[3:39:19] <Laironx3> Ok Woolie
[3:39:19] <@Solidus_113> the name changes were great

[3:39:36] <%wolfofsound> good idea
[3:39:38] <%StaceMcGate> Dat first part was hype as fuck tho
[3:39:39] <+zegoodknight> Story would have solved all your problems
[3:39:40] <+therabbles> highlight reel
[3:39:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> BITCHPIE
[3:39:48] <+XithrascinXV> just a 5 minute video of the mitch digger part is all you need
[3:39:48] <+TheGamerMaldito> First part was REALLY HYPE
[3:39:49] <%SirGO0SE> Persephone must live on
[3:39:50] <%RioGascar> actually dont do a full LP cause god the salt is hard to keep fueled. its exhausting of just constant fucking and things
[3:39:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh well, racism won in the end

[3:40:16] <+TheGamerMaldito> You can upload the 1st part and some EXTRAS at the end
[3:40:19] <Zebroneath> Such is the way of real video development. There's going to be some let downs.
[3:40:20] <Darren716> Honey try story mode

[3:44:39] <islandoasis> im salty that they managed to fuck up dokapon kingdom
[3:44:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> diebuster is terrible
[3:44:52] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Diebuster and Gunbuster are SO good.
[3:44:53] <+PerrinIsDead> How is Woolies chat worse than Pats?
[3:44:54] <Laveyrin> doodGood
[3:44:57] <mobius_won> Die buster is pretty great
[3:44:59] <redrins> diebuster IS great
[3:45:03] <am_omega> I am good with just Gunbuster.
[3:45:05] <mobius_won> Not as good as gunbuster but good
[3:45:07] <%wolfofsound> @PerrinIsDead I'm in both though LUL
[3:45:09] <%tearfuldevil> oooh ah ooh ooh, ah ah aha ah ah
[3:45:19] <%tearfuldevil> like the jazzy op
[3:45:25] <am_omega> GIANT ROBO: The day that stood still though is the best.
[3:45:32] <+RealPT1> I like Diebuster but feels a little mismatched next to Gunbuster
[3:45:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That creepy coach stuff was WEIRD
[3:45:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> At this point, I think chat is just representative of the people chat watches.
[3:45:54] <@Solidus_113> the original cross-arm pose
[3:45:57] <redrins> diebuster is just far future gunbuster
[3:45:59] <am_omega> GIANT ROBO OVA THO
[3:46:01] <Lenmutt> so just chillin n chattin?
[3:46:07] <NaturalGear> People who hate on Diebuster because of Gunbuster are like people who hate DS2 because of DS1
[3:46:20] <mobius_won> Final episode from both is godlike
[3:46:30] <Mvrdok_> SamFlam
[3:46:50] <@Solidus_113> samurai jack
[3:46:55] <heartlesshealer> G Gundam?
[3:46:56] <lemon_lore> got?
[3:47:07] <Mvrdok_> Star Wars Kappa
[3:47:11] <heartlesshealer> oh the negative ones
[3:47:14] <@Menitta> Thats The Matrix for me
[3:47:14] <%Tearonex> Samurai Jack STILL bums me out
[3:47:19] <heartlesshealer> battlestar galactica
[3:47:28] <%jiggy_snipe> feelslike a waste of time
[3:47:28] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus it's like having good sex then she shits all over your dick
[3:47:29] <+ValenMorrow> Endings are hard to write apparently
[3:47:30] <hntronium> The Guardian got done dirty in the end
[3:47:34] <Lenmutt> what is samurai world tho?
[3:47:34] <+balouie> STILL
[3:47:36] <am_omega> Yo don't talk shit about G Gundam. The ending was great.
[3:47:38] <%tearfuldevil> the star of the new samurai jack was so cool
[3:47:44] <lotharrio> Guardian got done dirty too much.
[3:47:45] <kinoreka> narcos mexico is pretty good :o
[3:47:45] <hntronium> Where's my old king jack
[3:47:46] <+balouie> still angry with how chuck ended
[3:47:47] <gade177> The Matrix is overrated. Also Jessica Jones Season 1 ending was terrible.
[3:47:53] <heartlesshealer> @am_omega I thought we were talking about the great ones when I said that
[3:47:59] <GeltonZ> G Gundam's ending is AMAZING. Best ending ever is GoDannar.
[3:48:03] <BreakersAweigh> samurai jack did kind of end on a fart unfortunately
[3:48:11] <am_omega> Okay.
[3:48:16] <NaturalGear> Jessica Jones S1 is basically JoJo Part 4
[3:48:17] <+marsantas> Never forget battlestar galactica
[3:48:20] <%tearfuldevil> the start of
[3:48:23] <lotharrio> Ending of How I Met Your Mother taints the entire show.
[3:48:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> speaking of endings...
[3:48:26] <+revrendike> I'd rather have a bad ending than no ending.
[3:49:03] <Darren716> I hope you guys try a longer normal Dokkapon game again
[3:49:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> @revrendike i would not
[3:49:27] <RyuuAoi> Is it over?
[3:49:37] <gade177> Almost.
[3:49:38] <%wolfofsound> I'd rather gut's just ends being on the island then a bad ending
[3:49:40] <neraren> Are there any that you think are good games that made for bad videos?
[3:50:02] <redrins> how tho, trackmania is the shit
[3:50:03] <arkv01> RRLEASE IT COWARDS
[3:50:07] <zenith0111> What Trackmania went no where? That game is so much fun
[3:50:20] <SuperKirby24> whaaaat trackmania?
[3:50:22] <%RioGascar> fun for 1 playwr
[3:50:28] <+revrendike> @CaptainPileDriver No ending for Symbiotic Titan is criminal.
[3:50:28] <%wolfofsound> oof ye
[3:50:29] <heartlesshealer> there are absolutely good games that aren't great to "just watch"
[3:50:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:50:30] <%RioGascar> not for multiplayer
[3:50:31] <arkv01> psychonauts was fun
[3:50:34] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[3:50:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @revrendike yeah, but if that show botched the ending, how much more painful
[3:50:51] <gade177> Oh yeah I remember that.
[3:50:52] <zenith0111> :(
[3:50:59] <@Solidus_113> and then you started KH
[3:51:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> but it was so good
[3:51:04] <hntronium> Oh yeah I remember Matt really not feeling psychonauts
[3:51:06] <Zebroneath> Shame, but it is what it is
[3:51:13] <MayorRev> KH letsplays kill channels
[3:51:15] <arkv01> @Solidus_113 too soon ScaredyCat
[3:51:18] <heartlesshealer> Matt kinda wasn't into a lot of things
[3:51:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> why not you play it psychonauts woolie
[3:51:20] <redrins> honestly at that point in the channels life what was matt feeling
[3:51:29] <gade177> I don't get why Matt didn't like Psychonauts.
[3:51:29] <+Cherororo> Ah man, I was so hype for the Psychonauts playthrough, but what can you do.
[3:51:31] <+Dr_DangerPhD> There's so much stuff in psychonauts you can miss by not exploring the camp
[3:51:32] <+JD_Lars> Diebuster was fine. There’s way more egregious sequels out there.
[3:51:34] <BreakersAweigh> lmao solidus....
[3:51:38] <%Javaa01> If you wanna do Trackmania right, do a community night on PC on a public server, just not in Turbo, that game has bad community features
[3:51:38] <ChinMusicTwo> Sometimes your not in the mood for a game even though its good
[3:51:44] <arkv01> you will never compile the KH LP because it's in limbo... unless?
[3:51:48] <am_omega> It was like around that time when Matt was just not feeling things.
[3:51:53] <zenith0111> Because it didn't have boobs or crass jokes.

[3:58:40] <gade177> Cool.
[3:58:42] <+gantz_zero> and long loading
[3:58:42] <Cobaltor_252> BibleThump
[3:58:57] <am_omega> Get the true ending though
[3:59:01] <rubbishbinge> yucky, bitchpies
[3:59:08] <heartlesshealer> Yoshi's Cookie
[3:59:11] <Darren716> Oh wow this has way more of a budget than boi
[3:59:13] <+zepelinnn1> damn woolie, dust out the SSD
[3:59:46] <californaya> it's less budget and more a different art style
[3:59:53] <californaya> Issac has TONS of content
[4:00:17] <%linSP> looking forward to that last for real isaac update
[4:00:28] <+dmtjinni> BibleThump
[4:00:31] <Darren716> Still the whole presentation is more impressive than isaac or meatboy
[4:00:43] <+gantz_zero> meatboy looked waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better
[4:00:44] <GenericTwitchAcc1> haha doo doo
[4:01:01] <%linSP> pee pee combo
[4:01:12] <californaya> yeah, this is just 3D, pretty basic, all things considering
[4:02:33] <%RioGascar> the cardboard looking just like cardboard but say...not decorated makes it look generic
[4:02:33] <+revrendike> A coin, viscera spells. This is basically The Adventures of Kissoon in the land of Everville.
[4:02:37] <+Estuko> @californaya I like it a lot, because it mostly appeals to my love for Paper Mario style world lol
[4:03:01] <%RioGascar> now if the walls get decorated or colored and changed then neat. But just cardboard flat looks...sorta lane
[4:03:04] <%RioGascar> *lame
[4:03:42] <zenith0111> I hope the actual game looks better than that tutorial
[4:03:51] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie how's your night going?
[4:03:54] <MayorRev> butt
[4:04:12] <+gantz_zero> seems kind of ironic how popular this has gotten just after the era of "broooooown"
[4:04:27] <%RioGascar> Alright yeah the walls do look pretty nice
[4:04:32] <EpitaphTransmits> !uptime
[4:04:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 14 minutes
[4:04:36] <%RioGascar> environments are cool looking
[4:04:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:05:12] <gade177> Oh so this is just turn based? "sigh".
[4:05:21] <+Shen2> That's cool, it's pretty much a puzzle game meets RPG
[4:05:49] <+gantz_zero> well, every puzzle movement is a turn @gade177
[4:05:56] <rubbishbinge> when's puzzles and dragons
[4:06:09] <%SirGO0SE> the cardboard aesthetic is great
[4:06:21] <%RioGascar> Im getting reminders of that OLD pitch for castle crashers
[4:06:29] <%RioGascar> where it was actually supposed to be cardboard
[4:06:54] <bevyrage> woolie missing a double attack on the previous board
[4:07:01] <zenith0111> Is Binding of issac by Behemoth?
[4:07:12] <+gantz_zero> no
[4:07:15] <+gantz_zero> definitely not
[4:07:54] <+gantz_zero> the publisher is literally listed as Edmund McMillen
[4:08:02] <%trustycoyote> Reminds me of Yoshis Cookie and Puzzle Quest
[4:08:02] <+gantz_zero> along with the developer
[4:08:10] <%SirGO0SE> been awhile since ive seen some yoshi cookie
[4:08:13] <%SomersaultJustice> warios woods is my fave
[4:08:15] <%yeknomlive> pokemon puzzle league was fun
[4:08:16] <zenith0111> @gantz_zero As suppose to metaphorically. Alright that makes sense then
[4:08:21] <%RioGascar> But the studio is behemoth i think
[4:08:25] <+Advenae7> puzzle and dragons crossover with mario on 3ds was good
[4:08:34] <%RioGascar> wait no thars super meatboys devs
[4:08:52] <+gantz_zero> the implication was that it wasn't even behind a company name @zenith0111
[4:09:06] <+revrendike> Anyone remember Gryomancer?
[4:09:06] <%yeknomlive> i had the game but no super scope
[4:09:10] <$afronooch> Steam page for Bum bo says Edmund Mcmillan and James Interactive iirc
[4:09:18] <GeltonZ> @revrendike I do! Barely.
[4:09:22] <EpitaphTransmits> @Puzzle Fighter I think but I could be wrong
[4:09:29] <zenith0111> @gantz_zero You don't need to imply it. I mean you directly said it
[4:09:31] <MayorRev> ohhh neat
[4:09:34] <GarbageNirvana> I think she's always been Peach in Japan
[4:09:35] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus Puzzle fighter I think
[4:09:36] <%SomersaultJustice> it's the first western game
[4:09:36] <$silentblast93> bumbo want coin
[4:09:40] <SoySocks> remember yoshi topsy turvy which was the gba game with the gyro in it for tilting gameplay?
[4:09:43] <%SirGO0SE> oh man Puzzle Fighter would be a real good one off
[4:09:43] <GarbageNirvana> It would be the first time we've seen it though
[4:09:49] <MayorRev> This gonna be a one-off i assume
[4:10:16] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus You should play Puzzle Fighter if you haven't
[4:10:24] <MayorRev> unless Woolie has a special Puzzle genre for his vids
[4:10:28] <+subwayterry> @SoySocks that was more of a fever dream than a game, what a strange concept
[4:10:31] <MayorRev> Get Into Puzzle Games
[4:10:47] <MayorRev> <o/
[4:10:54] <%RioGascar> it is a pretty interesting combat system
[4:11:08] <%Ecchigun> BOMBO?

[4:17:25] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying I do not remember, when I said a while I mean a fucking good while lmao. Uhhh gimme a sec... loloh shot gotta download 3k mb lol
[4:17:28] <%RioGascar> Im surprised edmund has been able to survive in a landscape thats evolved fast. but he has a established fan base so good on him
[4:17:33] <am_omega> The "I Wanna Be The" games are a whole genre.
[4:17:45] <%RioGascar> i think hes also doing a isaac card game series
[4:17:55] <$Noponiz> i wanna be that guy is for cowards. I wanna be the boshi is the real shit
[4:18:02] <FackinCrazy> I want Binding of Isaac 2 so bad
[4:18:07] <0rond> oh yeah there was four souls, the binding of isaac card game. it's really good
[4:18:07] <EpitaphTransmits> @Estuko hahaha take your time man and as soon as you open it up again you'll be bombarded with event notifications and other good shit lol XD
[4:18:16] <californaya> yeah, the Issac card game exists, Four Souls is pretty alright
[4:18:44] <serpenttucker> Man when the hell is repentance coming out?
[4:18:53] <Bryon_Youngblood> What the heck??? XD
[4:19:10] <Darren716> Man i forgot about the isaac card game, despite it being right under my bed
[4:19:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[4:19:16] <+gantz_zero> speaking of Trow Up
[4:19:22] <+gantz_zero> Throw*
[4:19:26] <0rond> if you don't intend to play this game religiously, I 100% recommend looking up the endings @WoolieVersus
[4:19:43] <%SirGO0SE> psaFist
[4:19:51] <EpitaphTransmits> @WoolieVersus If there is any game I would recommend Woolie its Honkai Impact 3rd
[4:19:51] <Laecerelius> tripped over the finish line
[4:19:53] <+gantz_zero> @0rond dude he's already got 40+ hours in
[4:19:58] <0rond> oh shit
[4:20:00] <0rond> nevermind than
[4:20:01] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying npnp lol
[4:20:27] <zenith0111> This seems like a nice little game
[4:20:29] <+Bluydee> I’ve never seen this game before
[4:20:30] <@Solidus_113> NEEDLES??
[4:20:30] <MayorRev> LUCKY TED
[4:20:37] <MayorRev> DRUGS
[4:20:46] <+Bluydee> there’s a boi deckbuilding game?
[4:20:53] <zenith0111> I love the popsicle sticks LUL
[4:21:05] <%RioGascar> I could see myself playing this during waiting in between college classes
[4:21:06] <0rond> honkai 3rd impact is like, it's wooliebait, but it's just the bait, nothing inside he will actually like other than it
[4:21:14] <MayorRev> Combo!
[4:21:21] <serpenttucker> You generally get the same progression based on what character you are on and what you have unlocked so far
[4:21:25] <%RioGascar> like how i play fuck tons of into the breach while waiting for class
[4:21:26] <42nfl19> I was away, who won the last game?
[4:21:28] <zenith0111> SourPls
[4:21:30] <JoeyStar> @bluydee yep it’s called binding of isaac four souls
[4:21:42] <serpenttucker> But enemies, spells and items aquired, etc is randomized
[4:21:43] <zenith0111> Music finally picking up
[4:21:43] <EpitaphTransmits> Memento Yae Sakura Is basically judgement cuttiong for her charged attacks lol
[4:21:44] <MayorRev> they tapped out last game cuz it took too long
[4:21:45] <0rond> four souls is really good. it reminds me of munchkin a lot
[4:22:00] <MayorRev> now its bumbo time
[4:22:07] <VJdarkworld> bum-boclaat
[4:22:31] <%jiggy_snipe> @42nfl19 Minh was leading but they ended early because it was getting boring
[4:22:39] <0rond> @WoolieVersus did you get to the endings with the DEEP LORE regarding binding of isaac?
[4:23:09] <%RioGascar> I actually like this a lot more than isaac
[4:23:14] <%RioGascar> the loot is clear
[4:23:15] <EpitaphTransmits> @0rond Memento Yae Sakura basically judgement cuts during her charged attacks big baits for him
[4:23:26] <%RioGascar> musics dope
[4:23:42] <%RioGascar> i really dig the aesthetic of this cardboard cutout stuff
[4:23:43] <0rond> yeah but the game is mostly automatic+ it's gacha and pretty shallow overall
[4:23:49] <+Mercer618> @quasiplaying she really is, but unless you lucksack her in the gacha then you're looking at a year or so of gathering fragments for her
[4:23:54] <RoboticRexkek> baka
[4:23:58] <SoySocks> NotLikeThis
[4:24:00] <MayorRev> oh dear
[4:24:01] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying o see upir jpmlers o,[act
[4:24:04] <+gantz_zero> wow
[4:24:04] <0rond> that's why I said, it's strong wooliebait, but only on the surface
[4:24:09] <serpenttucker> I wonder what modding for this game will look like outside of custom spells and relics
[4:24:11] <+gantz_zero> let me try that again
[4:24:17] <%RioGascar> i disagree, its got layers
[4:24:18] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying i see your honkers impact
[4:24:22] <EpitaphTransmits> @Mercer618 Now you can just farm her
[4:24:40] <MayorRev> Tetris 99 have co-op?
[4:24:49] <+Mercer618> Oh right with the purple tear looking things
[4:24:55] <gade177> Oh yeah Tetris is the most addicting game ever.
[4:24:59] <%yeknomlive> digestable?
[4:25:01] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero You mean Thirst Impact XD
[4:25:14] <0rond> tetris is the OG video game addiction.
[4:25:29] <+gantz_zero> honestly i just call it honkers because it's impossible for most people to get past the "Honkai" word @quasiplaying
[4:25:37] <%SomersaultJustice> that explains everything
[4:25:51] <+Mercer618> @gantz_zero literally same. I just call it Honkers
[4:25:56] <%yeknomlive> woolieFUN
[4:26:02] <rubbishbinge> chinese gacha bait is getting strong
[4:26:03] <0rond> there's the missing link of how Woolie "fighting games" woolz got into tetris
[4:26:10] <GeltonZ> Tetrisphere was awesome!
[4:26:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:26:30] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero Himeko has the largest compared to Rita
[4:26:31] <0rond> tetris sphere is woolie's hill to die on
[4:26:44] <0rond> FACETRIS WAS THE BEST ONE
[4:26:46] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying Himeko is big, but... Rita is my wife.
[4:26:51] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying yeah but no one knows about Ayla in Punishing Gray Raven
[4:27:17] <rubbishbinge> @gantz_zero just pulled her yesterday lol
[4:27:17] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero Nah Himeko deserves her happy ending, I'll be that captain
[4:27:25] <%linSP> linSP subscribed at Tier 1.
[4:27:30] <0rond> I would have considered getting into honkai 3rd impact if I wasn't already deep into FGO and just got into symphogear XDU
[4:27:41] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero who knows when that ever comes out but right now I'm waiting on Dragon Raja
[4:27:42] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying i do love Himeko the most
[4:27:50] <MayorRev> are those tapeworms?
[4:27:54] <SoySocks> either toilet paper or tapeworms
[4:27:55] <MayorRev> oh
[4:27:59] <0rond> nah they are toilet papers for sure
[4:28:06] <+Mercer618> See I'm just an idiot and got into honkai impact after being neck deep in Fire Emblem Heroes, FGO, and Dragalia
[4:28:08] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying i've been playing PGR since january. even without reading most of it, it's still incredibly fun on an emulator
[4:28:25] <Slimeking_Mike> Oh, like Asswipe?
[4:28:26] <%yeknomlive> like poop
[4:28:26] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Asswipe
[4:28:27] <MayorRev> EQUAL TO POOP
[4:28:33] <SoySocks> asswipe
[4:28:39] <0rond> edmund drew many, many tapeworms, that's not what his tapeworms look like
[4:28:39] <serpenttucker> Asswipe is a close approximate
[4:28:45] <%SirGO0SE> hell is always having a poopy butt that repoops itself after every wipe and you only have the thinnest roughest single ply
[4:28:50] <Oxybe> asswipe. bogrroll.
[4:28:51] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero The way I see it its basically Neir Automata meets steampunk but yeah, that game looks great
[4:29:00] <+Shen2> LUL
[4:29:01] <stormydaysz> can reggie confirm if its hurts more?
[4:29:04] <MayorRev> MOTHAFUCKA
[4:29:08] <DrStinkers> Butt tissue
[4:29:15] <serpenttucker> WOOOOOOAH
[4:29:24] <0rond> but it's so shallow, it's like if you only had the auto modes of bayo and nier automata
[4:29:48] <+gantz_zero> @0rond PGR?
[4:29:56] <0rond> Honkai 3rd impact
[4:29:59] <+gantz_zero> ah
[4:30:09] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero Punishing Gray Raven
[4:30:12] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus Show us at least a 7 bone setup
[4:30:27] <SoySocks> I love that lighting effect
[4:30:29] <+gantz_zero> mostly asking him if he meant gray raven or honkai @quasiplaying
[4:30:36] <%SirGO0SE> the lighting on that is great
[4:30:39] <+Estuko> Wanna know how to do a fucking bone infinite
[4:30:40] <Jack_of_No_Trades> getting psychonauts vibes
[4:30:44] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero ah ok
[4:31:01] <%RioGascar> Gibs are body parts
[4:31:10] <Dutchpotato> But what if bumbo?
[4:31:13] <%RioGascar> just a person exploded with a rocket launcher
[4:31:18] <%RioGascar> thats getting gibbed
[4:31:28] <+gantz_zero> a gib is roughly any chunk of flesh iirc @WoolieVersus
[4:31:33] <MayorRev> But Bumbo is cant is not you is not wall!
[4:31:48] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero Seele though is the purest child and needs constant protection
[4:32:44] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying seele is good, i wish they'd give fua ha mandatory glasses. i feel like she loses a lot of character without them, no matter what uniform
[4:33:40] <EpitaphTransmits> @gantz_zero Does she really htough? I always thought its for aesthetics since she's "immortal"
[4:33:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:33:41] <+Mercer618> @gantz_zero why can't her augment outfit have the glasses? The monocle is wack and she loses character without the glasses
[4:34:13] <MayorRev> damn woolie
[4:34:46] <+gantz_zero> yeah i agree @Mercer618 . well yeah, she just always looks smart and it's pretty unique because no one else wears glasses practically ever @quasiplaying
[4:35:12] <EpitaphTransmits> @Mercer618 I could agree with all that, but they defintely gave her that bit of extra love with her awakened form ie Sage Fuhua
[4:35:27] <Huntercd> Who is winning?
[4:35:35] <MayorRev> Yes
[4:35:37] <+gantz_zero> poop is winning @Huntercd
[4:36:32] <MayorRev> "Pop this bone and get a five piss"
[4:36:42] <serpenttucker> It's so weird seeing speedruns for RNG heavy games.
[4:37:09] <%StaceMcGate> five minute speedruns for Slay the Spire blow my mind

[4:38:37] <%HelghastTroop> in early versions of this gibs was a joke
[4:39:07] <%trustycoyote> The Woolie out of context twitter account has enough source material for days.
[4:39:18] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying start of Chapter 5 atm, middle of chapter 4 on Hard
[4:39:41] <%StaceMcGate> Say Mike Digger 3 times fast

[4:50:32] <hntronium> you did a big try woolie
[4:50:32] <%RioGascar> i do like the merit of games that exist for like casually chipping away
[4:50:33] <0rond> play bumbo the nimble, he is crazy
[4:50:40] <RyuuAoi> If at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again!
[4:50:41] <@chesterr01> @woolieversus absolute garbage skills
[4:50:50] <SoySocks> that's how it is in isaac as well with the character "The Lost"
[4:50:54] <0rond> bumbo the nimble is the most fun
[4:50:55] <%mitchteck> F
[4:50:55] <heartlesshealer> oh man, you've got that thing going on
[4:50:59] <%linSP> bumbo dead is great, those flies man
[4:51:01] <+BurkeBigsby> Jist like using The Lost is torture in Isaac.
[4:51:04] <0rond> yeah this is a character from BOI too
[4:51:05] <%RioGascar> @chesterr01 Dont you have some feet pics to see?
[4:51:05] <MayorRev> Is Dead your main?
[4:51:06] <damienlunas> Isn't The Dead like the best character in the game, or did they nerf him?
[4:51:11] <$TIME_PUNCHER> spirit hearts
[4:51:14] <0rond> he only has soul hearts in isaac too @WoolieVersus
[4:51:17] <@chesterr01> @riogascar DansGame
[4:51:21] <Flarepulse> woolie isn't it past your bedtime
[4:51:25] <EpitaphTransmits> @Estuko You heard of Dragon Raja though ?

[4:52:42] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Man, NL looks great with dreads psaSmug
[4:52:42] <%RioGascar> i think the switch is like the perfect indie game machine. it let me play SOOOO much into the breach in between my classes
[4:53:00] <heartlesshealer> Yeah I can see why getting good at this guy ruins you for the other characters
[4:53:03] <MayorRev> eww
[4:53:15] <dan_g_v> clench plays
[4:53:25] <$TIME_PUNCHER> blow out actual assholes
[4:53:42] <heartlesshealer> down or right
[4:53:52] <dan_g_v> @time_puncher indeed, the egg finally grew his hair
[4:53:53] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying nope
[4:54:05] <espanishcanamurciana> is this the garfield tactical card game @WoolieVersus ??
[4:54:05] <GarbageNirvana> Never understood why these games always have to be gross
[4:54:11] <dan_g_v> and he finally took some sun
[4:54:15] <GarbageNirvana> I guess that's just Ed McMillen's particular design sensibilities
[4:54:17] <%RioGascar> Its edmunds style sorta
[4:54:20] <%ChoculaUltra> is there an official pc version of teppen or is it solely through android emulation?
[4:54:35] <$TIME_PUNCHER> because breadmund, @garbagenirvana
[4:54:39] <0rond> most puzzle games are usually go for the "slick, clean, organized" look
[4:54:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> only woolie is left?
[4:54:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:54:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Ah yes, now I remember wtf bum-bo is
[4:54:54] <EpitaphTransmits> @Estuko I would highly suggest you give it a look, very customizable especially character creation
[4:54:55] <SoySocks> watch out for that second primed attack in the back
[4:55:01] <0rond> minh and reggie perished
[4:55:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Made in unity, I see
[4:55:13] <%RioGascar> well they do that cause the ui needs to be clean and understandable to establish the rules correctly
[4:55:18] <%ChoculaUltra> woolie consumed minh and reggie for their life essence.
[4:55:18] <heartlesshealer> one row to the right, two columns down
[4:55:20] <heartlesshealer> or end
[4:55:25] <%DomPressesButtons> ooph
[4:55:37] <lotharrio> Blue health, though.
[4:55:37] <+chiazam> Oh he was talking about this game on a stream a while back
[4:55:40] <$TIME_PUNCHER> pretty sure one of the Isaac trailers has Edmund and his friends buck-ass naked
[4:55:51] <+MrAtheGreat> VICTORY
[4:55:55] <0rond> but than you have this game where you have multiple sprites for each color, and the game has a much more messy feel
[4:56:08] <0rond> it goes against the norm in that regard
[4:56:09] <MayorRev> hi punchmom!

[4:57:55] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Puzzle Kombat? Candy Crush? Get that normie shit outta here
[4:58:02] <heartlesshealer> moving two rows can get boogers
[4:58:06] <heartlesshealer> but not sure if worth
[4:58:15] <%DomPressesButtons> so you solve tiles to create spells to later YEET at enemies?
[4:58:26] <$TIME_PUNCHER> basically
[4:58:42] <%DomPressesButtons> hmmm. I can dig it
[4:58:55] <%SirGO0SE> are the greens bushes or fart gas

[4:59:08] <hntronium> There's a teeth you can do I guess
[4:59:10] <%RioGascar> The bogger left and then use the down move?
[4:59:18] <NevikGamina> felt like you should have taken the reroll the board spell instead of the block earlier LUL
[4:59:40] <0rond> dude sleight of hand though
[4:59:42] <zamzoph> monkaS
[4:59:43] <$TIME_PUNCHER> missed the tinted rock

[5:00:19] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying aww cod mobile is fun though lol, crazy taxi for work
[5:00:25] <0rond> @WoolieVersus wouldn't sleight of hand have made all your spells free for the room? which means infinite movement?
[5:01:04] <heartlesshealer> ?
[5:01:23] <%RioGascar> Anyone here get the yakuza collection for y3-5?
[5:01:50] <%RioGascar> i wanna play it but man i gotta finish kiwami 2...then 3...then 4 and so on

[5:02:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[5:02:03] <%RioGascar> and man 100% those games is hell with the minigames
[5:02:30] <+chaumiester> I left for a bit. What happened to Minh and Reggie? Pizza Run?
[5:02:36] <%RioGascar> Nope
[5:02:38] <0rond> they perished
[5:02:40] <arkv01> minh and reggie were consumed
[5:02:41] <%RioGascar> its chill stream
[5:02:42] <arkv01> for MORE POWER
[5:02:43] <gade177> No they went home.
[5:02:51] <%RioGascar> they were consumed to chill
[5:03:01] <0rond> couldn't handle the ch i l l
[5:03:01] <+chaumiester> Were they.... a figment of Woolie's Imagination all along?
[5:03:06] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[5:03:16] <arkv01> this is comfy stream TPFufun
[5:03:19] <0rond> who are minh and reggie? are you sure they exist?
[5:03:20] <heartlesshealer> wait
[5:03:25] <%Vegaburd> pooped spots still work
[5:03:25] <heartlesshealer> move bottom row right
[5:03:32] <%Vegaburd> you just cant see it
[5:03:38] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Has Woolie mentioned playing Isaac Four Souls on tablelords?
[5:03:47] <QaizerArt> OH SO WE STILL GOING
[5:03:50] <QaizerArt> BUMBO IS THIS STRONG?
[5:03:50] <arkv01> @0rond I coulda sworn woolie was here all night by his lonesome..
[5:03:53] <damienlunas> You can use pooped tiles, you just can't see them. Also, if that tile moves in any way, the poop clears.
[5:03:58] <%SirGO0SE> ah so it doesnt change the tile into crap, it just hides what it is
[5:04:06] <%RioGascar> i dont think isaac four souls is actually retail out? Isnt it kickstarter?
[5:04:10] <arkv01> man that turdman kinda looks like... pat
[5:04:18] <+Goobbue> @RioGascar it is retail out
[5:04:20] <heartlesshealer> so what's the deal with the those garbage tiles?
[5:04:21] <0rond> it's brownie, he was in super meatboy
[5:04:27] <heartlesshealer> oh!
[5:04:48] <SoySocks> wait, they're not unusable, they're just blind?!?
[5:04:54] <cptkraut> hey woolie and chat :)
[5:05:03] <%king_wragles> Is this just for the stream, or is Woolie getting LP footage rn?
[5:05:04] <jaid251> The music is very good
[5:05:04] <%RioGascar> damn, well then. Speaking of board games. i need some recommendations for a boardgame for friends who like deception and hidden agenda games
[5:05:08] <heartlesshealer> blind tiles is somehow scarier
[5:05:10] <%Javaa01> It's Mega Brownie, also not a bro like Brownie was
[5:05:22] <%RioGascar> we have played: coup, secret hitler, betrayl, and dead of winter
[5:05:33] <MayorRev> put more poop up woolie
[5:05:38] <%RioGascar> Oh and cash and guns
[5:05:59] <0rond> there's werewolf
[5:06:16] <%RioGascar> we dont often have enough people for that
[5:06:27] <%RioGascar> most we got is 8, usually we are 5-6
[5:06:30] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[5:06:38] <%RioGascar> Sometimes less around 4-5
[5:07:08] <heartlesshealer> line up tower of yellow?
[5:07:09] <0rond> maybe avalon?
[5:07:30] <%RioGascar> I’ll keep that one in mind
[5:07:43] <0rond> the genre you are looking for is called "social deduction games"
[5:08:01] <heartlesshealer> possibly more reeth
[5:08:03] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[5:08:09] <%Vegaburd> move bones
[5:08:11] <MayorRev> oh no
[5:08:16] <%Vegaburd> then one right
[5:08:20] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah bones

[5:09:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:09:26] <%Javaa01> Blue Baby can't use red hearts
[5:09:36] <%Vegaburd> ALWAYS MIDDLE
[5:09:40] <%Vegaburd> smh
[5:09:46] <%SirGO0SE> oh man its followable right until the end
[5:09:53] <bevyrage> yeah it's always middle
[5:09:53] <%Javaa01> Because you don't actually have health containers as Blue Baby
[5:10:02] <%Vegaburd> no
[5:10:05] <%Vegaburd> im just memeing
[5:10:08] <%Vegaburd> wait
[5:10:08] <+Estuko> LUL
[5:10:08] <bevyrage> been a staple since binding of isaac
[5:10:09] <heartlesshealer> very bumbo
[5:10:14] <MayorRev> dont lie to him!!!!
[5:10:14] <+Estuko> @Vegaburd Hi One Guy :)
[5:10:23] <%SirGO0SE> psa1guy
[5:10:27] <MayorRev> Nice job one guy
[5:10:30] <am_omega> Oh no
[5:10:31] <+MoonToxin> who would lie on the internet :<
[5:10:31] <0rond> the binding of isaac staple is never play the shell game because it's garbage and not worth it
[5:10:35] <%Vegaburd> @Estuko its me!
[5:10:40] <%RioGascar> One guy in a chat of 20 active chatters
[5:10:42] <%RioGascar> rip
[5:10:50] <bevyrage> binding of isaac was 50% middle prize while sides were 25%
[5:11:02] <bevyrage> bum-bo apparently has the same rate
[5:11:06] <arkv01> sending my chemicals to help you combat the poopies LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts
[5:11:20] <0rond> what?
[5:11:25] <0rond> where are you getting that info?
[5:11:26] <am_omega> I am just downloadin my anniemays, like Galvion and the Giant Robo OVA.
[5:11:34] <%RioGascar> See if it was real life it would be neither sides cause the con artists quickly zoomed it up their sleevs
[5:12:00] <heartlesshealer> oooh combo
[5:12:03] <heartlesshealer> nice
[5:12:20] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[5:12:26] <heartlesshealer> can enemies overheal?
[5:12:35] <dustworthmain> what if there's only 1
[5:12:36] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can also just kill the last one for free right?
[5:12:49] <SoySocks> @WoolieVersus good if there's one enemy left, or if you can use it at the start of a room
[5:12:54] <%RioGascar> Wait can you just 1 shot a boss?
[5:13:00] <heartlesshealer> dang
[5:13:09] <heartlesshealer> spend one poop to get 5
[5:13:15] <am_omega> Oh man what if that works on bosses?
[5:13:26] <+hyroph> skipping boss rooms skips boss rewards though
[5:13:34] <%Javaa01> Yeah, but the skip does come at the cost of not getting the coins for killing the boss
[5:13:47] <+Estuko> @heartlesshealer that is just beautiful wording.
[5:13:50] <%RioGascar> gotta weight benefits and cons
[5:13:52] <reonome> holy shit woolie playing bumbo
[5:13:56] <RoboticRexkek> big poo
[5:14:01] <heartlesshealer> thanks
[5:14:04] <%RioGascar> cause maybe that boss will rekt your sh it
[5:14:09] <reonome> did the devs fix all the game breaking bugs yet
[5:14:09] <0rond> why didn't you take sleight hand earlier (spells cost less for the room) wouldn't it basically give you infinite movement?
[5:14:24] <%Vegaburd> oof
[5:14:30] <+RenoDeGeneric> Use it to kill the last one alive
[5:14:34] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[5:14:40] <RoboticRexkek> big yikes
[5:14:41] <heartlesshealer> yeah that's not great at all
[5:14:49] <am_omega> Save it for the last enemy in the room.
[5:14:50] <%linSP> is the attack fly still bugged?
[5:14:50] <SoySocks> not good, but could help with final enemy in a room
[5:14:55] <+hyroph> @0rond i think theres a lower limit for spell costs to avoid that
[5:15:21] <0rond> really? edmund usually encourages crazy broken combos rather than limit them?
[5:15:27] <+valiard> yeah if it's the final enemy should be really strong
[5:15:46] <%RioGascar> well a puzzle game needs more “balancing”
[5:15:49] <%dantejoestar21> dantejoestar21 subscribed at Tier 1.
[5:15:55] <heartlesshealer> uhh
[5:16:04] <%RioGascar> it cant just be super fucked hard at the beginning for example
[5:16:06] <am_omega> So that won't rez enemies so just use it on the last enemy in a room.
[5:16:06] <hntronium> Wasn't the one on the left under fly dot?
[5:16:23] <RoboticRexkek> you can have crazy good run too, like isaac
[5:16:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:16:30] <JetpackMcQuack> This is like the old solo stuff
[5:16:31] <%RioGascar> i imagine theres also the thing of making the tile generation not unfair and fuck you
[5:16:35] <+KENTASHIRO> Big greed, nice
[5:16:36] <heartlesshealer> greed on display

[5:17:24] <heartlesshealer> teeth by move down?
[5:17:25] <%RioGascar> La hi ho
[5:17:26] <heartlesshealer> or that
[5:17:27] <RoboticRexkek> I never did a 7 yet, I suck at puzzle games XD
[5:17:39] <0rond> in practice teeth is more like the death tarot card
[5:17:45] <hl98> is this the same woolie from game grumps?
[5:17:55] <%SirGO0SE> @hl98 LUL
[5:17:56] <%RioGascar> ...no????
[5:18:00] <am_omega> Man that would be great if we saw the final ending on stream.
[5:18:01] <0rond> yes, this is woolie formely of game grumps fame
[5:18:08] <heartlesshealer> from spiderman, yeah
[5:18:12] <rosemon5001> @segbas2004 easy just switch your mindset to i want coin and you can do it
[5:18:19] <RoboticRexkek> yes he's the other member that left the first year of GG
[5:18:40] <+Estuko> poop as a currency fucking hits my stupid childish sense of humor I work hard to bury
[5:19:00] <%SirGO0SE> loonies twonies and poonies

[5:26:43] <heartlesshealer> and then start moving stuff
[5:26:49] <RoboticRexkek> maybe because there's only one ennemy?

[5:47:56] <hntronium> go for extra move?
[5:48:11] <0rond> YOU CAN BLOCK
[5:48:21] <0rond> this is super doable
[5:48:28] <heartlesshealer> move bottom row one
[5:48:38] <heartlesshealer> or do that
[5:48:41] <%RioGascar> i feel it should be having a confirmation system for the tile movement. Or a into the breach style reverse
[5:48:49] <am_omega> You can poop
[5:48:57] <hntronium> you can poop
[5:48:59] <heartlesshealer> armor
[5:49:15] <reonome> you need a spell
[5:49:20] <%RioGascar> And also the system being the way it is...might be why its not on switch. Touch would be a pain in the ass for this
[5:49:20] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[5:49:20] <bevyrage> move poop for double stack of poop?
[5:49:50] <bevyrage> forgive me punch dad
[5:49:54] <+Kensei_cornutus> I would setup boogers for next turn

[5:50:12] <reonome> i mean right
[5:50:15] <+Kensei_cornutus> 6 is better than 7
[5:50:18] <arkv01> man this game would be nuts with a mick gordo soundtrack
[5:50:24] <+Kensei_cornutus> 7 is 2 6 is three
[5:50:45] <heartlesshealer> puzzle time
[5:50:46] <%SirGO0SE> sound track is already so good

[5:52:07] <BlackMage66652> LUCKY TEDUMBO
[5:52:09] <+Kensei_cornutus> could be free combos later
[5:52:21] <0rond> ah yes, northernlion luck
[5:52:22] <$Noponiz> the 1 up tho
[5:52:26] <%RioGascar> Does luck possibly influence the grid spawns?
[5:52:27] <$Noponiz> believe
[5:52:30] <bevyrage> if it works the same as binding of isaac, the 1up will give him his run starting health
[5:52:34] <am_omega> "No I am so unlucky, I got luck!"
[5:52:37] <%trustycoyote> It would suck if the higher the luck stat... the more luck you get NotLikeThis
[5:52:39] <hntronium> Did woolie pick the 1up or the health from kills?
[5:52:45] <+Kensei_cornutus> confidence is key
[5:52:52] <bevyrage> 1up. health from kills doesn't restore soul hearts
[5:52:53] <%SirGO0SE> !motivated
[5:52:53] <@Moobot> 677 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:52:59] <bevyrage> !motivated
[5:53:00] <am_omega> Work that 1 am brain
[5:53:03] <hntronium> Would the kill heals actually have worked for blue hearts?
[5:53:08] <heartlesshealer> toothy boy?
[5:53:11] <0rond> I feel like he had 2 chances to super break and exploit the game, and he skipped both
[5:53:13] <%Javaa01> Nope
[5:53:27] <%Javaa01> Blue hearts can't be healed
[5:53:28] <%SirGO0SE> i dont think he knew about the free movement @0rond
[5:53:33] <XzileGaming> probably not @hntronium didnt work in isaac
[5:53:33] <arkv01> dignity and dabs
[5:53:44] <%Javaa01> And he has no Red heart containers to fill
[5:53:46] <+Kensei_cornutus> B O N E S A C T I V A T E D
[5:53:47] <0rond> both free spells at low HP and sleight of hand could have worked
[5:53:49] <heartlesshealer> mana drain

[5:54:12] <arkv01> @0rond it's cool, I like it when there's a lot of fumbling and stumbling
[5:54:21] <+Kensei_cornutus> any def would fix this
[5:54:25] <%SirGO0SE> big stumbo for bumbo
[5:54:31] <0rond> yeah no, it's still a super fun stream, I don't care for the gameplay much
