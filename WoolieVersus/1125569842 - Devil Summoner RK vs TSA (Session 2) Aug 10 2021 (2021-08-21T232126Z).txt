[0:03:37] <%X2Eliah> most of those opinions were from ppl who mainly watch on yotube
[0:03:43] <Shad0wTag> What about on Get Into Fighting Games against viewers?

[0:04:34] <Applecannon63> what youtube comments?
[0:04:37] <dds333a> @x2eliah methinks highly unlikely
[0:04:38] <leith_aziz> It should be made clear that chat and youtube comments are like 2 different audiences, at least that's how it looks like when I check the comments
[0:04:40] <jimmytwofeet> That looks great!
[0:04:44] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Seems good
[0:05:01] <%Juriasu> I thought Woolie was going to say he got feedback on his dreads
[0:05:04] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz well yeah, that's what led to that reddit poll outcome.
[0:05:09] <andre11dr> YT community, the best and most reasonable as always Kappa

[0:12:59] <dds333a> for better or for worse.
[0:13:02] <Am_Shigar00> "this is where Jojo truly begins"
[0:13:05] <andre11dr> It will probably be like 60 episodes
[0:13:06] <+mMayrro> LUL solidus

[0:13:19] <+NukeDaHippies> Part 7 is the GOAT
[0:13:20] <@Solidus_113> Bohemian Rhapsody will likely be replaced with WB characters

[0:13:52] <andre11dr> 5 had some what the fuck moments but in 6 he really starts pushing boundaries
[0:13:54] <dds333a> no, they don't all work
[0:13:54] <Applecannon63> We must watch the sixth sense just in case
[0:13:54] <Tracazoid> LUL

[0:14:44] <leith_aziz> Honestly, this sounds a lot like Guilty Gear to me. Which is concidental considering how much I love both series
[0:14:53] <dds333a> written in '01 onward
[0:14:54] <%Juriasu> the near future time of 2011
[0:14:54] <+FuqBoiSlim> stone ocean was published in like 2003 but takes place in 2011?
[0:14:56] <brexdq> but it came out in 2001
[0:15:01] <drunken_lemur> 10 years in the future is now 10 years in the past
[0:15:12] <leith_aziz> Both are Batshit insane and and also somehow enjoyable and interesting?

[0:15:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> part 6 has some of the SICKEST body horror in the series, like, nightmare shit
[0:15:34] <+Stupid121v2> Yeah and part 8 is ending
[0:15:34] <andre11dr> Oh no ,not the baby
[0:15:37] <saiyanblitz> Da Babu
[0:15:42] <dds333a> a mother even eats her baby in Jojo LUL
[0:15:49] <brunoberserk> we dont talk about THE BABY
[0:15:55] <Applecannon63> A baby stand
[0:16:05] <andre11dr> The Dragon it going to fucking cool to see it animated
[0:16:08] <Applecannon63> @dds333a Baby head stand
[0:16:12] <brexdq> does that mean giorno has been running the mafia for like 10 years
[0:16:12] <leith_aziz> We had an invisible Baby as well

[0:17:48] <andre11dr> There was pandemic once, guess what, it went away eventually
[0:17:49] <drunken_lemur> How deep can Jolyne go?
[0:17:53] <leith_aziz> Didn't the Smpsons parody this?
[0:17:56] <leith_aziz> *Simpsons
[0:18:03] <Applecannon63> ZONE OF DEATH!?
[0:18:04] <andre11dr> @drunken_lemur BALLS DEEP
[0:18:17] <plankk56> sounds like high schooler stuff "zone of death"
[0:18:19] <+NukeDaHippies> @leith_aziz Is that the bottomless hole?
[0:18:22] <sonicchris92> Hello
[0:18:23] <%bread_assassin> It exists, but it wouldn't fly in court.
[0:18:34] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz I was thinking a plan involcing Sideshow Bob
[0:18:40] <time_axis> pay2spoil mode Kappa
[0:18:45] <andre11dr> I don't see how that helps, just don't read it
[0:18:51] <leith_aziz> Apologise on the spellinmg
[0:18:53] <dds333a> @time_axis LUL LUL
[0:18:55] <leith_aziz> *spelling
[0:18:57] <Applecannon63> Also DBFZ Patch!!!
[0:18:59] <JetpackMcQuack> Game by game, disco would‚Äôve been a mark
[0:18:59] <derap41> Maybe have a designated chat reader
[0:19:20] <Mr_Zero5232> Fair enough, it ain‚Äôt that big a deal for me
[0:19:34] <andre11dr> At least put it in follower only mode
[0:19:43] <@Solidus_113> it is
[0:19:48] <leith_aziz> All I know about Part 8 is that it's weird. JUST that fact
[0:19:50] <Dakuu75> "oh cool, it gets worse."
[0:20:04] <brunoberserk> DRUGS
[0:20:05] <%Drunkengen> YO WEATHER DO YOU KNOW MICKEY MOUSE?
[0:20:06] <Am_Shigar00> Part 8 is really weird
[0:20:08] <andre11dr> There's some goofy shit that happens in 6
[0:20:10] <time_axis> he read a science textbook poorly
[0:20:11] <Applecannon63> I can't believe they made Dragon Ball Fighterz 2 by a patch
[0:20:15] <dds333a> the intro fight actually makes no sense, and I mean that without exaggeration
[0:20:17] <%Lion_kun> Do you believe Part 7 will get an anime?
[0:20:21] <Dakuu75> XD
[0:20:23] <+lordericter> part 6 is also a massive pivot from 5 blessedly
[0:20:24] <RetroCop87> watching the chat freak out about even the POSSIBILITY of sub-only mode is great
[0:20:26] <leith_aziz> Its embrasing the absurdity and creativness
[0:20:34] <%Juriasu> I think some parts of 6 is too weird for it's own good, but 7 really nails a great balance imo
[0:20:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:37] <+snugglepuggs> Wait did Woolie beat the first Raidou game??
[0:20:41] <Mr_Zero5232> The series starts off at 50 on the weird shit-o meter and just goes higher from there
[0:20:42] <zerointelligence000> It embraces the camp
[0:20:47] <Applecannon63> Part 6 was trippy
[0:20:49] <%TubeMan642> two words Boheminan Rhapsody
[0:20:49] <andre11dr> 7 feels like it was made on LSD and cocaine
[0:20:53] <dds333a> agreed
[0:20:55] <drunken_lemur> Part 1 was too weird for me.
[0:21:00] <%Lion_kun> Anime only are gonna get their world rocked
[0:21:02] <JetpackMcQuack> R) japan only
[0:21:05] <leith_aziz> I think I might stay with the Anime cause I dont mind watching unspoiled.
[0:21:08] <dds333a> should've read it by now really Kappa
[0:21:12] <+mMayrro> being at least one part ahead in the manga is a good move imo
[0:21:13] <@Solidus_113> There's a stand in part 6 that specifically only works for betting on games
[0:21:16] <leith_aziz> And yet, I feel like I've already been spoiled
[0:21:18] <andre11dr> The powers in 7 are SO wierd
[0:21:18] <Valentine_Evelyn> I forgot most of the part 6 manga
[0:21:21] <linSP> just delete twitter 4head
[0:21:25] <%kewlmyc> That logic applies to really every anime to manga adaption though. Like MHA and AoT.
[0:21:28] <Captbutt> some random comment already spoiled part 6 to me while watching part 5...
[0:21:28] <+thedream_c> I'm excited for part 6
[0:21:34] <kingra> People will want to talk about these cool several year old things
[0:21:36] <+thedream_c> because its gonna be the gateway to part 7 :)
[0:21:39] <dds333a> @linsp this too
[0:21:41] <%kewlmyc> manga to anime adaption I mean
[0:21:44] <+Stupid121v2> read da mango
[0:21:48] <Mr_Zero5232> I mean, it‚Äôs existed for years and you still haven‚Äôt read it, then you wasn‚Äôt trying to and shouldn‚Äôt expect such sensitivity
[0:21:50] <%Drunkengen> lets go to church
[0:21:54] <ardbart> Have Reggie read it?
[0:21:55] <+thedream_c> eyah def no downside
[0:21:57] <Valentine_Evelyn> take twitter outback and shoot it to death people can't shut up
[0:22:05] <DedlokPM> @JetpackMcQuack I keep seeing it saying worldwide and a trailer for it is even on the english netflix channel. So I think it seriously may be on US netflix in december
[0:22:12] <+thedream_c> its win/win from this piont on unless for some reason people dislike both 6 and 7
[0:22:20] <%Lion_kun> Bohemian Rhapsody is gonna get ravaged in the anime.
[0:22:21] <+mMayrro> @kewlmyc JoJo's thing is that the manga has been around for a good while now, so some people tend to think "oh the manga's super old, if you didn't read it yet it's on you"
[0:22:23] <Applecannon63> Dio Ship
[0:22:25] <DingusMcBaseball> people are gonna spoil it totally
[0:22:26] <dds333a> that's the whole deal, since DP has stayed committed to esse totally bring the manga, in motion
[0:22:26] <+lordericter> as it has been with every part of Jojo, Read the Mange
[0:22:32] <JetpackMcQuack> people like jojo
[0:22:33] <Treasure_Vault> I have forgotten everything i have ever heard about Jojo, except that some dudes have time powers
[0:22:33] <Valentine_Evelyn> can you trust one guy?
[0:22:33] <andre11dr> Also don't jump into 6 without watching everything that came before, DONT
[0:22:40] <+thedream_c> jojo is sorta self contained so its not that bad sticking in one arc
[0:22:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AlteisenReiseZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 20? Damn I've been here too long. LUL Anyway, keep up the amazing work Woolz and Reg, thanks! Also, HOW BOUT THEM DBFZ PATCH NOTES?!
[0:22:49] <%jinking79> ppl rereading to see wat the manga stuff they add/took out for the anime
[0:22:49] <linSP> how many guys does it take to ruin the fun
[0:22:50] <drunken_lemur> The Viz Shonen Jump app is cheap but only has the first 4 parts
[0:23:01] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> How the hell are they supposed to end JoJolion in the next issue?
[0:23:06] <Zedkan> @drunken_lemur honestly a god like app
[0:23:06] <Mr_Zero5232> @mmayrro but it is on them though, if you don‚Äôt wanna get spoiled on something that‚Äôs existed for years by that points
[0:23:08] <leith_aziz> Woolie, I dont mind weird/complicated stuff if in the end it turns out interesting and compelling,despite how batshit insane it can be at times. Speaking as a JoJo/Guilty Gear fan
[0:23:12] <andre11dr> 6 is really dependent on you watching every part until it
[0:23:26] <Qu1ckyyy> 8 isn't spoilable it's way to weird
[0:23:35] <+thedream_c> yeah 8 is ... its own lil world
[0:23:41] <%Drunkengen> 4 balls
[0:23:42] <mrblitzstream> 7 iss too cool to spoil
[0:23:43] <Applecannon63> I doubt it
[0:23:44] <%Juriasu> the only one I can think of is voilet evergarden
[0:23:44] <dds333a> @thedream_c it's very much not self-contained, but if you've already seen the Parts, then the anime is a worthy enough successor that you can start from the stuff you haven't seen.
[0:23:47] <derap41> You never know with netflixs
[0:23:52] <%jinking79> part 8 just a Elvis Tribute
[0:23:58] <leith_aziz> Is 8 suppoused to be the finale? Or will we start with a new chapter?
[0:23:58] <+pectusumbra> netflix has done that with multiple anime, but there's been no confirmation either way. Just have to wait and see
[0:24:08] <drunken_lemur> I expect maybe batches of episodes at most.
[0:24:09] <@Solidus_113> the times they do that is when it's like 8 episodes
[0:24:12] <@Solidus_113> not 39
[0:24:18] <Applecannon63> JP Netflix does it a weekly
[0:24:18] <dds333a> @leith_aziz not sure, but I hope there's a Part 9
[0:24:23] <leith_aziz> It sounds like all episode will release at the same time
[0:24:24] <+thedream_c> @dds333a its contained to a point. Like they tell you about Jolyne's dad. But if you needed back up lore on certain things then sure. But its heading to one direction anyway.
[0:24:26] <%Juriasu> I just really hope they won't fuck over other regions if the decide to go with simulsubs
[0:24:27] <andre11dr> I tried to spoil myself on 8n,but just made myself confused and dizzy
[0:24:27] <dds333a> even if it's jut an epilogue
[0:24:33] <NotHereToStream> you mean dbfz2?
[0:24:34] <+Stupid121v2> that shits WILDDDD
[0:24:36] <JetpackMcQuack> It's back baby
[0:24:37] <zerointelligence000> Dbfz became Mahvel
[0:24:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> GOKU BLACK IS BACK IN THE GAME
[0:24:39] <@Solidus_113> new game again
[0:24:39] <DedlokPM> Yeah it will not be like 39 eps all at once. At most 13.
[0:24:42] <Tracazoid> I wonder how long until Strive gets a wild patch list like that
[0:24:45] <Applecannon63> MAHVEL BABY
[0:24:46] <%jepupu> Rollback tho?
[0:24:47] <OldManDeckardCain> dragon ball infinite plus R
[0:24:47] <%Juriasu> it really is
[0:24:49] <+Stupid121v2> NAPPA EXISTS NOW
[0:24:50] <@Solidus_113> Z Broly has even MORE tools to bully
[0:24:50] <+thedream_c> VERY MUCH a new game
[0:24:58] <Zetsubera> My boy zetsubOof
[0:25:01] <shaddydaddyo> 5 raiders from shaddydaddyo have joined! 
[0:25:01] <+thedream_c> they added/adjsuted systems again
[0:25:01] <Applecannon63> Did they buff SUPER BROLY!?
[0:25:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> They tore down the system
[0:25:06] <zerointelligence000> we turbo now
[0:25:07] <%Prevot> I wish it was LITERALLY  a new game so it could have rollback
[0:25:08] <+thedream_c> S Broly got slight buffs
[0:25:11] <Valentine_Evelyn> did they patch the netcode?
[0:25:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> Burn it all down
[0:25:13] <andre11dr> Why would they make Broly better WHY
[0:25:20] <%jepupu> I'm still not gonna play the game until Raditz is in.
[0:25:27] <Applecannon63> BEERUS BALLS
[0:25:31] <+thedream_c> most of the strong chars didn't get majjor changes
[0:25:39] <+thedream_c> but Golden Frieza STAYS taht way now even if you tag him out
[0:25:39] <Applecannon63> BEERUS B A L L S
[0:25:54] <%kewlmyc> What about Beerus balls?
[0:26:04] <Applecannon63> he can flick them
[0:26:05] <dds333a> @thedream_c a very small point really, since major concepts from SO are lifted directly from PB and SC. without those Parts, it's completely unintelligible in major parts. it's like trying to understand BT without PB, or JJL without SBR
[0:26:06] <andre11dr> Beerus got way better apparently
[0:26:25] <%kewlmyc> Couldn't he always do that?
[0:26:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MVC:I TAGS
[0:26:30] <%Juriasu> that is insane
[0:26:32] <+lordericter> yeyeyeyeyeye
[0:26:37] <Applecannon63> flick them into a loop
[0:26:47] <%Juriasu> like everything we know about that game is different now
[0:26:50] <%elderpunch> ROLLBACK BABY
[0:26:55] <@Solidus_113> no rollback
[0:26:55] <Applecannon63> GOHAN
[0:26:59] <Applecannon63> LV 7
[0:27:02] <leith_aziz> Also, Z Broly got buffs and only buffs. im not kidding
[0:27:04] <+thedream_c> i dunno who expected rollback
[0:27:04] <Applecannon63> FUCK
[0:27:05] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL let's buff offence
[0:27:08] <+thedream_c> DBFZ +R
[0:27:11] <dds333a> ideally better LUL
[0:27:16] <%elderpunch> wait i thought we were getting rollback
[0:27:16] <+lordericter> trap the inside the infinite tsukuyomi of supers
[0:27:19] <%elderpunch> smh
[0:27:19] <+thedream_c> i mean they buffed defense. So yeah offense is getting NUTTY
[0:27:22] <andre11dr> This seems like testing for DBFZ 2
[0:27:24] <Applecannon63> ULTIMATE GOHAN LV 7
[0:27:24] <%kewlmyc> If they do a rerelease with Rollback, that would make it one of the best fighters ever
[0:27:31] <%kewlmyc> Or a sequel
[0:27:32] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 S Broly got some buffs, but I would say it doesnt fix his issues. I can say that his damage is more bonkers
[0:27:39] <%elderpunch> NotLikeThis
[0:27:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:27:42] <@Solidus_113> well, maybe not free. there's still a pretty long cooldown on tags isn't there?
[0:27:43] <dds333a> @thedream_c this is true
[0:27:47] <leith_aziz> I tried the game out again. I wanted to enjoy it. But really, it just made me realise what bothered me about it. The neutral. Jumping around for half the match, trying to 2H a constant jumper only for him to do a delayed superdash and then vanish combo, etc.
[0:27:52] <Applecannon63> Special to Special Cancel
[0:27:54] <%Prevot> when has an already released game been updated to have rollback?
[0:28:00] <leith_aziz> @Prevot MKX
[0:28:07] <@Solidus_113> Accent Core
[0:28:11] <@Solidus_113> FEXL
[0:28:12] <dds333a> cmonBruh
[0:28:14] <AsinPersuasion> gold freeza resets if you tag him out
[0:28:14] <Zetsubera> OR if he tags out
[0:28:15] <@Menitta> 3rd strike
[0:28:16] <AsinPersuasion> as well
[0:28:18] <%jinking79> i neee that
[0:28:24] <leith_aziz> @Prevot Also +R by the help of modders and Arcsys themselves
[0:28:26] <@Menitta> KOF 2002, Garou
[0:28:34] <%AlteisenReiseZ> SSJGOKU GOT HIS 2M BACK
[0:28:39] <%Prevot> did they release these games then patch different netcode afterwards?
[0:28:48] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz the game eschewed neutral at this point. Though there is enough depth to figure ways to fight against chars who benefit the system.
[0:28:54] <Applecannon63> Zamasu is like Storm on crack?
[0:28:56] <leith_aziz> @Prevot Basically, yes
[0:29:03] <@Menitta> They released 2002 and Garou without it and then patched it in
[0:29:04] <leith_aziz> Shame
[0:29:11] <%Juriasu> Namco Bandai doesn't think rollback is worth it for the game it seems
[0:29:12] <+thedream_c> Zamas has has air movmeent now, but I don't he does anything crazy with it
[0:29:23] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:29:26] <+zanz_san> MVCI has good rollback
[0:29:26] <leith_aziz> WORLD TOUR with DELLAY BASED NETCODE
[0:29:29] <%jepupu> woolieFUN only
[0:29:30] <+thedream_c> not only that but the Championship is in AUG 28-29
[0:29:34] <+lordericter> that's rough
[0:29:37] <NotHereToStream> we need a rollback patch soon, REAL SOON
[0:29:38] <leith_aziz> FailFish
[0:29:40] <+thedream_c> so you only have 4 weeks to prep with a new patch. NOT ENOUGH time IMO
[0:29:54] <+thedream_c> these changes run deep AND online play
[0:29:56] <Zetsubera> dnoGOOSE
[0:30:00] <dds333a> nope
[0:30:06] <%jinking79> yo we're not make Fighter 2 for a long time so here these patches
[0:30:07] <leith_aziz> Well, at least I still have Strive.
[0:30:10] <zerointelligence000> gotta wait for 2 I guess
[0:30:11] <andre11dr> It's to late to asd online
[0:30:15] <leith_aziz> That's up to Bandai Namco
[0:30:19] <+thedream_c> pretty much. But here is hoping FIghterZ 2 has rollback
[0:30:21] <+saltpiggu> i don't want to play delay based netcode ever again. And I won't
[0:30:21] <%jepupu> I might've come back to it. Even without Raditz.
[0:30:23] <Applecannon63> At least STRIVE is getting PATCHES
[0:30:27] <+thedream_c> because if fighterz 2 don't have rollback, kiss the series goodbye
[0:30:30] <leith_aziz> Arcsys themselves stated that they cant do anything without Bamco's say so
[0:30:36] <Applecannon63> STRIVE PATCHING MORE FUN
[0:30:39] <%Juriasu> dbfz would have been back then what strive is now if it had rollback
[0:30:39] <leith_aziz> So, no rollback unless Bamco says so
[0:30:46] <+SuperUnhappyman> bamco is also harada right?
[0:30:49] <@Solidus_113> Did Hit get anything nice? I didn't see him in the list
[0:30:50] <andre11dr> A game has to be made with rollback in mind you can't just add it in
[0:31:00] <+thedream_c> MOtoki  is DBFZs producer
[0:31:04] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Happy to see that. Only hope the game gets more fun. Love Sol, but people are getting salty
[0:31:07] <kojanga> so nago...
[0:31:08] <NotHereToStream> Nago, but without bloodrage
[0:31:09] <+thedream_c> so she has last say. But I think Harada has influence with that team too
[0:31:20] <Zedkan> @andre11dr didnt they literally add it to R
[0:31:23] <Zedkan> plus R
[0:31:23] <dds333a> at the behest of Nando Bamcai LUL
[0:31:27] <Eger007> @WoolieVersus Have you heard Bleach is coming back?
[0:31:28] <+thedream_c> cuz Harada's other title is BNE Esports guy or something

[0:34:40] <linSP> what‚Äôs bleach for
[0:34:40] <+thedream_c> thats all I think of bleach: the cleaning agent
[0:34:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19

[0:34:44] <%jinking79> squad zero was a disappointment
[0:34:47] <andre11dr> Damn everyone really not feeling Bleach, I'm not one to talk, i gave up at episode 2 LUL
[0:34:52] <Eger007> it was good once
[0:34:53] <stardustcrusad3r> based reggie
[0:34:53] <%Juriasu> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:34:53] <+MakoTensei> Bleach is in my top 5 shows
[0:34:53] <+thedream_c> but I'm down to see more Kubo female char designs in other media
[0:35:01] <brexdq> but ichigo's going to hell
[0:35:01] <Mr_Zero5232> Cause Moneh
[0:35:01] <NotHereToStream> what happened to burn the witch or something
[0:35:04] <BaslerJones> bad bunch
[0:35:05] <%Juriasu> bad batch is pretty good
[0:35:07] <drunken_lemur> The Bad Bitch?
[0:35:10] <@Menitta> Fuckin anime
[0:35:12] <leith_aziz> Watch Clone Wars
[0:35:13] <dds333a> @leith_aziz no, it just has controversy for several reasons, most of it minor. they're exaggerating for jokes
[0:35:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wow the rawest
[0:35:17] <plankk56> ay that boruto fella fucking weird
[0:35:18] <mrblitzstream> @drunken_lemur LUL LUL LUL
[0:35:19] <%Juriasu> bad batch is clone wars season 8 basically
[0:35:19] <Joestar1890> I liked Clone Wars more, but it ain't too bad
[0:35:19] <%Drunkengen> oh boy watch clone wars lol
[0:35:22] <DSD24> I head Burn the Witch was good
[0:35:23] <alrobot2014> @thedream_c have you checked out new Sakura wars then?
[0:35:34] <+JupiterDjin> clone wars and rebels are great, well worth the watch
[0:35:35] <+Dova573> Honestly I want a Tite Kubo character designed Fighter
[0:35:38] <Mr_Zero5232> Yo Boruto is fuckin tresh
[0:35:39] <+thedream_c> @alrobot2014 yes I am very aware. Along with Burn the witch.
[0:35:41] <ALTRNico> Is Woolie just starting this game?
[0:35:43] <%Juriasu> yes
[0:35:43] <Eger007> YES
[0:35:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yes
[0:35:46] <drunken_lemur> Wasn't it literally a cut story arc from Clone Wars?
[0:35:46] <leith_aziz> It got better overtime
[0:35:48] <leith_aziz> Yes
[0:35:51] <ALTRNico> HOLY SHIIIIIIT
[0:35:53] <Zedkan> last season was incredibly mid
[0:35:57] <andre11dr> Clone Wars gets better as it goes
[0:35:57] <leith_aziz> It only gets better as it continues
[0:36:00] <@Menitta> Clone Wars is fine
[0:36:01] <mrblitzstream> WHo can't wait for Shield Hero Season 2 tho
[0:36:02] <dds333a> I was gonna say "did he listen to Woolies" LUL
[0:36:05] <+thedream_c> @Dova573 I think he should go the way like Kosuke Fujishima with the Tales SEries
[0:36:08] <drunken_lemur> Skip the JarJar episodes
[0:36:10] <jimmytwofeet> I heard Naruto gets mad at Orochimaru for missing the parent teacher's conference for his 'son'
[0:36:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> Anything can spawn hentai, but Bleach was the king of doujins for a time.
[0:36:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> The jarjar episodes are actually kinda good tho
[0:36:20] <andre11dr> Rebels has some stuff that i hate but most is good
[0:36:28] <leith_aziz> I think Season 1 is pretty hit and miss from what I've heard, so maybe watch some episodes and go to Season 2
[0:36:30] <+zoe_wynnes> arent they just finishing bleach? the anime never ended, but the manga did
[0:36:39] <kuningaz45> is it safe to come here?
[0:36:48] <derap41> The peripheral stuff is best when it comes to star wars
[0:36:48] <XoftheTITANS> the ending of Naruto is far worse than Bleach's ending. and I prefer Naruto
[0:36:50] <@Menitta> I'm at the point where I dont wanna sit through seasons of bad to get to something maybe good
[0:36:53] <dds333a> @kuningaz45 welcome, friend
[0:36:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> catJAM
[0:37:00] <SkinnyRite> Bruh we're at the club listening to a Star Wars convo is Covid over?
[0:37:02] <+MakoTensei> dunking on bleach and proceeding to gas star wars lmao
[0:37:07] <drunken_lemur> I like how Woolie doesn't even bring up Resistance.
[0:37:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> @kuningaz45 Just keep all your coming to yourself
[0:37:12] <kuningaz45> how many disco elysium spoilers are there?
[0:37:24] <andre11dr> Not any
[0:37:25] <time_axis> @kuningaz45 none
[0:37:28] <DSD24> I mean its Devil Summoner today
[0:37:28] <mrblitzstream> check the pdocast for the spoilers
[0:37:29] <Mr_Zero5232> Both Clone Wars and Rebels had meh beginnings and then they took their heads ou t their ass and finished stronger than they started but that shit is frustrating
[0:37:31] <andre11dr> Well hopefully
[0:37:34] <leith_aziz> Rebels in general is hit and miss, but it's worth the watch for some episodes. Cant spoil some special character appearances, but they're great
[0:37:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> So far none, but people will probably spoil it in chat now that Woolie beat it
[0:38:11] <%Juriasu> it's fine to miss out on the backstory, I think bad batch is meant to be a gateway into those shows for anyone who hasn't already seen them
[0:38:13] <@Menitta> please dont spp
[0:38:13] <Mr_Zero5232> And then there‚Äôs Resistance that they sent out to die a slow death
[0:38:18] <@Menitta> woops
[0:38:38] <drunken_lemur> It's actually kind of fun to go into Rebels first and then treat Clone Wars as a prequel.
[0:38:54] <DSD24> Welcome back to Jojo Part 4
[0:39:02] <XoftheTITANS> haven't watched any of the Star Wars shows, after seeing how awful Part 7-9 were.
[0:39:06] <NotHereToStream> yeah, game audio loud
[0:39:07] <Zebroneath> ye, lil loud
[0:39:07] <leith_aziz> @drunken_lemur I've actually seen more of Rebels than Clone Wars. Gotta find a time to commit

[0:39:54] <DSD24> Tsushigomo
[0:39:57] <Mr_Zero5232> @xofthetitans honestly it‚Äôs unfair to judge the shows based on those as the shows all have different directors, most have actual plans and people that give a shit
[0:40:10] <Lost8oClown> have you guys heard about bongbong?
[0:40:10] <BaslerJones> oh wait when did woolie start this lp ? i thought this was part 1 lol
[0:40:11] <%Prevot> narrowly avoided jailtime
[0:40:19] <DSD24> @BaslerJones Last week
[0:40:25] <andre11dr> No this is stream 2
[0:40:33] <Applecannon63> @baslerjones that was last week
[0:40:34] <enerkaizer> It's kinda shocking how well this game looks by todays standards thanks to using JPGs for the backrounds instead of actual models
[0:40:37] <dds333a> another house call
[0:40:45] <Lost8oClown> sometimes I forget just how good this soundtrack was
[0:40:52] <DSD24> Breakdown!
[0:40:54] <BaslerJones> does this game have an aligment mechanic ?
[0:40:56] <+pupil31> SourPls

[0:42:15] <enerkaizer> @andre11dr I know that, but I haven't seen this game in ages and I'm just positivly surprised how well this game holds up visually.
[0:42:20] <%codymagpie> look at that dance!
[0:42:24] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 oh, good question LUL
[0:42:31] <DSD24> Raidou has a permit for those bullets

[0:44:23] <Am_Shigar00> SMT V is giving Jack his own unique Bufu spell.
[0:44:32] <%Drunkengen> get
[0:44:35] <DSD24> Its my boy!
[0:44:36] <CosmicBard> Which jack variant
[0:44:37] <dds333a> Fury demons are always my jam
[0:44:37] <brunoberserk> skeleton warriors DA DA DADA
[0:44:38] <BaslerJones> there are two digimons in digimon 1 that looked like pyro and jack frost and they just fuck about shibuya
[0:44:39] <%Juriasu> he's a pyro pyro jack
[0:44:39] <DSD24> I love Pyro Jack!
[0:44:40] <mrblitzstream> damn that looks slick
[0:44:42] <Joestar1890> One-third of the Jack Bros.
[0:44:48] <andre11dr> I think that guy is unique to these games
[0:44:50] <jimmytwofeet> You can pyro jack in the privacy of your own home, sir
[0:44:50] <enerkaizer> Are there some unique demons for Raidous games, or do some simply not get used anymore anywere in the smt series?
[0:44:51] <Applecannon63> Spinal combined with Faust
[0:44:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> I thought pyro jack was generally stronger than jack frost
[0:45:00] <CosmicBard> Oh damn, Raidou?  You lose a bet?
[0:45:01] <DSD24> Pyro Jack is the best I love him
[0:45:08] <dds333a> none as Brute and Wargod in other games
[0:45:11] <TheMagneticDragon> Jack The Ripper, Pyro Jack and Jack Frost
[0:45:14] <Am_Shigar00> @enerkaizer Devil Summoner as a whole as a bunch of unique demons that rarely show up anywhere else
[0:45:20] <dds333a> @enerkaizer yes, a few
[0:45:27] <OblivionSword1> pyro jack with zio is pretty weird
[0:45:29] <time_axis> @enerkaizer There are some unique ones, but most get used elsewhere
[0:45:40] <andre11dr> I wish Pyro Jack got a Black Frost equivalent
[0:45:42] <dds333a> @zanzibarian_hamster it varies, really
[0:45:55] <DSD24> Mana Bonus is pretty good
[0:45:56] <linSP> reroll time
[0:45:56] <enerkaizer> thx for all the answer :)
[0:46:00] <mrblitzstream> @TheMagneticDragon fuse them all to gether and you get The final Jack.... Jack Black
[0:46:07] <%Prevot> LUL
[0:46:07] <quietshun> You can just grab another agathion wherever you need it
[0:46:12] <enerkaizer> Okay, I don't miss re-rolling. That mechanic always sucked
[0:46:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> @dds333a I know, but I've played a lot of the SMTs and this is the only one i've seen where pyro is weaker, it's just a bit odd
[0:46:17] <dds333a> it's the standard SMT deal where some demons are notably more important in some installments then other
[0:46:24] <Am_Shigar00> @mrblitzstream I have actually seen fanart of Jack Black in a Frost hat
[0:46:28] <TheMagneticDragon> @mrblitzstream No, you get the Big Mara
[0:46:29] <DSD24> That's the good one!
[0:46:29] <%Drunkengen> Nice
[0:46:43] <dds333a> could be worse Kappa
[0:46:47] <Applecannon63> Why aren't Pyro Jack or Jack Frost in Smash!?
[0:46:51] <dds333a> you might NEVER get the combo you want
[0:46:59] <DeafeninSilence> in the older games you had to deselect both demons NotLikeThis
[0:47:02] <%Prevot> this is what they want the games to be, they just gave up in the newer ones
[0:47:03] <DSD24> SMT Rep should have been in Smash
[0:47:16] <kingra> <3
[0:47:17] <DSD24> He's way cuter
[0:47:18] <mrblitzstream> @Am_Shigar00 oh damn im gonna look it up LUL
[0:47:21] <Applecannon63> SHOCK FUSION
[0:47:22] <dds333a> @dsd24 could still happen
[0:47:24] <OblivionSword1> HO
[0:47:25] <enerkaizer> I still remember the pain of getting a perfect Helel in P4...took me 2 hours until the rng gave me what I wanted
[0:47:28] <+CaptainJax> HEE HO
[0:47:29] <mrblitzstream> @TheMagneticDragon LUL LUL LUL
[0:47:31] <Sonicdy> Nah its come from Mara Kappa
[0:47:37] <hamahiroyuki> WASSAP HO
[0:47:37] <+JupiterDjin> spitting bars from brith
[0:47:38] <DSD24> Flynn would be a good rep or Demi Fiend
[0:47:44] <TheMagneticDragon> @Sonicdy Not just any Mara, BIG MARA
[0:47:45] <dds333a> he's also kind an asshole
[0:47:55] <dds333a> these demons, I mean
[0:47:58] <Applecannon63> a lovable asshole?
[0:48:01] <Valentine_Evelyn> I'm a fusion accident
[0:48:09] <dds333a> @applecannon63 yes, exactly
[0:48:19] <Am_Shigar00> I think Demifiend makes the most sense as a smash rep.
[0:48:35] <%X2Eliah> So is there precedent in Japanese mythology for demon-blending?
[0:48:42] <andre11dr> Aren't we all just fashion accidents?
[0:48:56] <ManaSpurt> @Applecannon63 All assholes are lovable if they're BIG enough.

[0:51:14] <kingra> You can capture the zombies demons too right?
[0:51:21] <+choopercabra> @X2Eliah In the original manga they explain that demons fuse with each other to become stronger
[0:51:22] <Applecannon63> nope
[0:51:22] <dds333a> @kingra nope
[0:51:23] <+JupiterDjin> No more mind read either
[0:51:30] <enerkaizer> I wonder how many people know how and why ever devil-man series (and even the movie) is canon xD" Man I love Nagais works, even the weird ones
[0:51:44] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim She's a good one but I was thinking of Daidouji
[0:51:46] <DeafeninSilence> i think you can get agathion in the daidoji mansion
[0:51:47] <dds333a> Kappa

[0:57:38] <dds333a> Gouto has to hold your hand, dude
[0:57:46] <Am_Shigar00> honestly though this is an issue that tends to happen a lot in Raidou 1.
[0:58:11] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 intentional in both games, it's to lend the investigative aspect
[0:58:12] <mrblitzstream> Gouto to guide your hips ONCE AGAIN

[1:03:57] <Murdercles> always give to RAIDOU
[1:04:01] <+haitakaa> can you use it on Raidou?
[1:04:03] <quietshun> Raidou's magic stat raises gis other demons stats
[1:04:04] <zanzibarian_hamster> All stat ups go to YOU all the time, no matter what
[1:04:04] <%sirisvirus> I think you can use it on yourself
[1:04:21] <%Prevot> these demons ain't loyal
[1:04:21] <dds333a> @carlioo yes, demons are entirely invisible to everyone except the spiritually attuned and those who choose to reveal them. The Dark World removes that cirtcumstance
[1:04:31] <quietshun> It also raises gis magic defense and lowers magnetite cost
[1:04:36] <dds333a> @murdercles this is what I did
[1:04:42] <DSD24> Raidou 2 Dark World
[1:04:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> sorry for asking, is this emulated or on a real ps2 / ps3?
[1:05:01] <Am_Shigar00> It's a totally legit PS2 copy played on the Sony xbox controller
[1:05:07] <Sapphire_Breeze> of course :)
[1:05:08] <andre11dr> I actually don't know
[1:05:16] <%Drunkengen> i think its the emulator
[1:05:21] <mrblitzstream> oh damn good catch
[1:05:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> man I love the music in this game
[1:05:26] <andre11dr> I think it might just played on a PS3
[1:06:14] <+haitakaa> you should probably just look up a list for your own sanity
[1:06:20] <dds333a> they transfer across shots, you don't actually need to do that LUL
[1:06:20] <+pupil31> Haaa ah :(

[1:10:32] <Eustacecervidae> I mean isnt it normal for rich people to have demon caves under their houses where thy sacrifice innocent people to get their fortune?
[1:10:39] <Am_Shigar00> I kept Moh Shuvuu on my team for my whole playthrough of Raidou 1.
[1:10:51] <dds333a> hey, not all summoners are Kuzunoha Kappa
[1:10:53] <%Drunkengen> Walking the path of the heavens

[1:11:13] <dds333a> demons are so fucking stupid they will kill themselves
[1:11:16] <Am_Shigar00> huh, I completely forgot this mechanic was in Raidou 1. I used it way more in 2.
[1:11:35] <dds333a> @johei_mctaro sure is
[1:11:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Woolie explain what led to playing this game at the start of the stream?
[1:11:43] <johei_mctaro> cool

[1:39:24] <%codymagpie> LUL
[1:39:30] <%Afterman_> just buy both at once
[1:39:35] <+saltpiggu> @heartlesshealer I think drinking ages only really became a thing post prohibition in the states
[1:39:39] <andre11dr> I'm not the biggest fan of beer either way
[1:39:45] <%Afterman_> but yea i dont like beer
[1:39:48] <%Afterman_> give me that tasty shit
[1:39:48] <andre11dr> Ill take cider instead
[1:40:17] <dds333a> yup
[1:40:17] <dinnydanny777> I don't like white wine, it dries my mouth
[1:40:18] <%heartlesshealer> @saltpiggu Hmm... probably, yeah. I'd have to check again, but that sounds right
[1:40:35] <mrblitzstream> Beer  is my last option or at a BBQ. Whiksy and Dark Rum allday for me
[1:40:40] <%ironohki> Pabst is the best of the worst.
[1:40:57] <mrblitzstream> Japanese whisky to be precise
[1:41:07] <andre11dr> I like white wine, but i had some really cheap white wine once that fucked my stomach
[1:41:15] <cosmov06> Preach
[1:41:39] <dds333a> LUL
[1:41:40] <andre11dr> Infact i have 4 cider bottles
[1:41:45] <Treasure_Vault> Frangelico and Coffee because if you're going to do a drug, do three drugs
[1:41:46] <Applecannon63> Cider is so fucking good
[1:41:57] <andre11dr> Fuck it ,time to get drunk watching Raidou
[1:42:09] <Tsoulus> cider is so sweet most of the time
[1:42:11] <%whyskeywolfe> I knew Woolie had a bit of Irish in him.
[1:42:12] <Applecannon63> but boy you get shit piss with Cider
[1:42:18] <@Solidus_113> I only ever drink coke & whiskey
[1:42:21] <+BignanasTheGawd> i took 2 jaegerbombs and didnt sleep well for 2 days
[1:42:26] <+lordericter> I always thought black velvet was Champaign and beer not cider and beer
[1:42:26] <mrblitzstream> i like the dry ones better then the sweet ones tho
[1:42:52] <johei_mctaro> I can drink anything with soda, alcohol by itsef will make me puke
[1:42:55] <dds333a> he didn't notice LUL
[1:43:21] <Tsoulus> j√§germeister is pretty tasty though
[1:43:22] <andre11dr> I'm a fan of LI Icetea ,but to much of it will really fuck you up
[1:43:34] <Tsoulus> perfect when skiing
[1:43:54] <mortificent> the Devil Summoner games were all set in the Persona/If universe, right?
[1:43:56] <johei_mctaro> confusing morale with loyalty is the last mistake of many commanding officers
[1:44:23] <dds333a> @mortificent yes
[1:44:25] <+pupil31> LUL
[1:44:33] <Tsoulus> is that yoda
[1:44:34] <+Rlexp> @mortificent dude the smt timelines are almost incomprehensible anyway
[1:44:37] <dds333a> bad shit has happened here
[1:44:51] <brunoberserk> gouto is a better detective than you
[1:44:58] <xeros720> i'm honestly surprised everytime the persona games are ever in the same timeline
[1:45:13] <dds333a> @brunoberserk yes, yes he is
[1:45:20] <+Jetfandam> Does this cat also tell you that you should go to bed because you are sleepy?
[1:45:36] <johei_mctaro> being a real detective must suck because most people don't have diaries
[1:45:38] <Am_Shigar00> I mean, the connections were more obvious in the pre P3 era games. Modern ones feel like they do everything in their power to avoid directly referencing the other entries.
[1:45:44] <%thecraye> no, he does not
[1:45:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:51] <Phob05> He'd probably tell you to wake up cause there's work to do
[1:45:53] <Applecannon63> oh jeez
[1:45:54] <andre11dr> @jetfandam Luckily, no
[1:45:58] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 in as much as trivia

[1:51:10] <dds333a> hey. he finally used it LUL
[1:51:23] <Am_Shigar00> They're bringing back Turdak in SMT V, and I'm really happy
[1:51:26] <+TunakIn> wait this is a semi action game
[1:51:41] <andre11dr> The lore behind this dude is pretty cool
[1:51:41] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 he's rarely been absent really
[1:51:47] <mrblitzstream> Wait so Raidou has The ITIs  bullets
[1:52:01] <mrblitzstream> ready to go night night bullets
[1:52:05] <dds333a> Turdak is an og mainstay, like Pisaca
[1:52:26] <+conqab> this looks awesome! I would've loved it as a kid
[1:52:34] <%thecraye> man, i hate pisaca
[1:52:37] <+conqab> still fun now I'm sure
[1:53:02] <andre11dr> Yeah this is for kids totally...
[1:53:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:53:04] <dds333a> Pisaca is my favorite demon, personally LUL
[1:53:25] <andre11dr> I mean have you seen Mara ,totally children material Kappa
[1:53:32] <Am_Shigar00> @dds333a he actually hasn't been in a new game for a while. The most recent appearance were the PQ games.
[1:53:41] <dds333a> superbly inventive design
[1:53:58] <mrblitzstream> So the Raiju you have been killing the whole time
[1:54:00] <enerkaizer> No lucky Ted? Kappa
[1:54:04] <Applecannon63> ORTHRUS?
[1:54:09] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 as in both? because Pq2 was rather recent. also, he was in P5
[1:54:18] <dds333a> at least, I'm almost certain
[1:54:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> Byakko when?
[1:54:33] <Phob05> I don't think he was unless it was in royal
[1:54:38] <Applecannon63> BIG DAMAGE
[1:54:43] <dds333a> he's a dog, but yeah Kappa
[1:54:56] <andre11dr> Was Turdak in P5 ,i don't remember seeing him
[1:55:01] <Applecannon63> Orthrus Wolf?
[1:55:13] <Am_Shigar00> I'm looking it up and I don't see him in any P5 lists
[1:55:38] <Applecannon63> GAIN ORTHOROS VULCAN's POWER
[1:56:20] <mrblitzstream> Living on the EDGE
[1:56:24] <Am_Shigar00> I don't think Turdak is even in the mobile game.
[1:56:49] <+RingingTheBellsOfZetta> Just got news that Idris Elba is playing fucking Knuckles in the next Sonic movie.
[1:57:00] <dds333a> @ringingthebellsofzetta cmonBruh
[1:57:27] <Phob05> I am altering the deal
[1:57:35] <andre11dr> @ringingthebellsofzetta Ok ,sure ,reality can't take me by surprise at this point
[1:57:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> yo, this just came in but Idris Elba might be Knuckles in the new Sonic movie??
[1:57:51] <Applecannon63> !?
[1:58:03] <Clyderso> Yooooooo PogChamp

[1:58:59] <Phob05> Army guy
[1:59:09] <Applecannon63> dammit Woodhouse
[1:59:37] <Applecannon63> CARD CRUSHER
[1:59:42] <%thecraye> the butler is very chill, considering that there are literal demons all around in the house
[1:59:52] <Applecannon63> the card crush meme
[1:59:59] <andre11dr> Well he can't see them
[2:00:12] <Am_Shigar00> dawww, little detective kit sounds adorable!
[2:00:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[2:00:39] <+saltpiggu> random encounters are rough.
[2:00:42] <claudio_777> The random battle frequency on these old SMT games is ridiculous
[2:00:47] <+chief_chongo> if i never played a SMT before, whats a good one to start with?
[2:01:01] <Phob05> 4 if you have a 3Ds
[2:01:03] <dds333a> dds is a good stsrt
[2:01:15] <dds333a> you can conceivably start anywhere
[2:01:15] <arofllol> DDS, nocturne, IV
[2:01:16] <sodamin1> @chief_chongo smt4 is a good starting point, just be wary the 1st dungeon is a killer
[2:01:29] <%thecraye> 4 is very good
[2:01:30] <Phob05> Probably 5 if you're willing to wait
[2:01:35] <sodamin1> that too
[2:01:36] <+chief_chongo> might have to bust out the old 3ds
[2:01:38] <+saltpiggu> The first dungeon in IV is harder than the entire game
[2:01:44] <AnacondaVirtue> It's Japan, this is the most open and shut shit possible
[2:01:48] <+chief_chongo> lol wat
[2:02:02] <arofllol> IV's difficulty completely disappears after naraku
[2:02:13] <dds333a> @claudio_777 it's especially egregious in the Raidou games. the other games aren't nearly like this LUL
[2:02:20] <Phob05> There's 7? SMT games on 3Ds
[2:02:32] <arofllol> soul hackers is also really cool, as for 3DS
[2:02:41] <dds333a> @phob05 and the majority of them are rereleases LULrereleases

[2:02:46] <Applecannon63> Oh wait isn't this based on Japan court system yeah‚Ä¶ thats rough
[2:02:49] <%ExpressNode> I think Minotaur and Medusa are the first hurdles then the game gets really steady
[2:02:51] <+saltpiggu> Yeah it even has a remake of the saturn Devil Summoner game that Raidou is a prequel to
[2:03:06] <Am_Shigar00> Let's see... Devil Survivor 1 & 2 remake Soul Hacker Persona Q1 & 2 SMT IV & IV Apocalypse Strange Journey remake Yeah, lots on the 3DS.
[2:03:07] <mrblitzstream> Damn is there a flowchart i can find like woolie did with the kirby games
[2:03:12] <Phob05> I wish we had MORE SMT re-releases
[2:03:16] <arofllol> devil summoner remake is only on psp
[2:03:16] <mrblitzstream> Asking for a friend
[2:03:22] <arofllol> unless you meant soul hackers remake
[2:03:32] <andre11dr> Minotaur is hard but he still isn't as big as a wall as Matador
[2:03:35] <%Drunkengen> THE MANSION ARC
[2:03:37] <+saltpiggu> Devil Survivor is fantastic, DS2 is apparently a big step down but I never played it
[2:03:49] <dds333a> @mrblitzstream you can at least find lists, but flowcharts don't matter because almost none of these games are connected
[2:03:53] <Am_Shigar00> I've heard Devil Survivor 2's plot is weaker, but the gameplay is an improvement
[2:04:01] <Applecannon63> Backtrack again
[2:04:05] <%Prevot> still mad we got TMS#FE instead of Devil Survivor 3
[2:04:05] <@Solidus_113> imagine mobile phones existing
[2:04:10] <AnacondaVirtue> Cardassian-ass legal system
[2:04:13] <Phob05> The circumstance is that you're guilty
[2:04:16] <dds333a> @saltpiggu in timeline only. at least
[2:04:21] <mrblitzstream> @dds333a thanks for the tip SeemsGood
[2:04:29] <arofllol> with SMT you're probably best off checking out longplays and playing the one that looks coolest to you
[2:04:37] <dds333a> @mrblitzstream np
[2:04:37] <Applecannon63> Japan Court System in the past is fucking One Sided
[2:04:55] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:05:05] <claudio_777> Uber eats some bullets
[2:05:06] <%Prevot> @applecannon63 in the past?
[2:05:07] <Am_Shigar00> Thank god Raidou 2 streamlined the gun mechanics.
[2:05:08] <Applecannon63> why do you think Ace attourney exist!?
[2:05:09] <%thecraye> HelloBullet
[2:05:11] <Murdercles> selling bullets to a high school student btw LUL
[2:05:11] <%Drunkengen> All of the gun
[2:05:16] <+pupil31> Bulletsy
[2:05:23] <+saltpiggu> Oh, also, Strange Journey kicks ass, people used to call it SMT4 before SMTIV became a thing
[2:05:23] <andre11dr> Gun up
[2:05:44] <andre11dr> Strange Journey is awesome
[2:05:48] <%Prevot> wasn't Strange Journey supposed to be SMT4
[2:05:53] <dds333a> @saltpiggu due to the fact that it is all but SMTiv
[2:05:57] <%Prevot> but atlus cowarded out
[2:05:58] <arofllol> yea but since it's not set in tokyo they changed that
[2:06:02] <time_axis> SJ is its own thing
[2:06:02] <Am_Shigar00> @saltpiggu Strange Journey didn't click with me as much as I hoped, my completionist attitude with collecting demons screwed me over with demon co-op
[2:06:37] <%sjay662> sjay662 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Idris Elba as Knuckles The Echidna is the most bespoke casting I‚Äôve seen.
[2:06:49] <arofllol> @Am_Shigar00 that's the one thing I didn't like, though it's still more forgiving than some of the older games flat out denying you from mixing law/chaos in the party
[2:06:52] <+saltpiggu> @Am_Shigar00 I just think the setting of all these international super soldiers getting decimated by demons was cool, like a starship troopers type thing but SMT
[2:07:13] <Am_Shigar00> @saltpiggu That was really cool and uinque for SMT
[2:07:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:07:31] <andre11dr> Yeah i imagine SJ is a OCD nightmare
[2:07:31] <Am_Shigar00> @arofllol Yeah, I think Sessions from TMS are a much nicer take on the system.
[2:07:50] <dds333a> this is where st. elmo's fire comes from
[2:08:08] <andre11dr> But if your just looking to get the demons you find cool it's not super bad
[2:08:14] <Phob05> The other poltergeist art has him carrying a chair
[2:08:30] <+chief_chongo> sahagin
[2:08:32] <dds333a> and the other has him as an electrical sprite
[2:09:00] <Phob05> You might be thinking of gremlin
[2:09:01] <Murdercles> goddamn is there any way to play Strange Journey on a fucking TV? I cant stand that it is locked on handheld
[2:09:05] <andre11dr> Honestly my biggest complaint with SJ is that they brought back the fps dungeons but you get used to them
[2:09:11] <%elderpunch> alot of cool christian mythology u can learn from these games
[2:09:12] <dds333a> @phob05 I am, yeah LUL
[2:09:20] <dds333a> realized it just after I posted
[2:09:37] <arofllol> @Murdercles you can try emulating on citra and upscaling it, idk how well it works though. game runs well at native res
[2:09:39] <+chief_chongo> WutFace
[2:09:46] <dds333a> thanks
[2:09:47] <+chief_chongo> roofleSolshake
[2:09:51] <OblivionSword1> oh god
[2:09:52] <Am_Shigar00> haaah, I forgot that they did that sometimes.
[2:09:52] <%thecraye> it's just a speed up, calm down

[2:10:21] <BlackermanZX> good job poltergeist... i guess
[2:10:23] <brisk_dacat> Where did he find that??
[2:10:23] <tolloponik> Quest Item?
[2:10:26] <Dakuu75> this ghost has some weird fetishes
[2:10:29] <dds333a> smell it, er, sell it
[2:10:34] <Am_Shigar00> Remember all the vender trash you could get in SMT IV? Porn, vibrators, old underwear, good stuff.
[2:10:35] <andre11dr> Damit Japan, always with the panties
[2:10:46] <andre11dr> Why the panties
[2:10:50] <%Prevot> first underwear, next is bathwater
[2:10:50] <johei_mctaro> why is this lp so
[2:10:52] <tolloponik> 12 bucks USED!?

[2:11:30] <Phob05> In 2 some are for side quests but here it's just good for money
[2:11:41] <Dakuu75> the fact that he still takes it lol

[2:13:10] <+JupiterDjin> Remember Kids: Kiryu says don't show your panties to anyone who you don't love.
[2:13:19] <andre11dr> I don't get panties, like is it for the smell or what?
[2:13:38] <Phob05> Good ol Beezy boy
[2:13:51] <Murdercles> the scout skill does not find items hidden by the inspect skill
[2:13:55] <%ZweihanderSteve> TOOBS
[2:14:00] <BlockingDisabled> @andre11dr No, you're supposed to wear them.
[2:14:02] <Onamar> TUUUUUBES
[2:14:08] <Am_Shigar00> More pokeballs!
[2:14:10] <BlackermanZX> summoning tubes
[2:14:17] <dds333a> @murdercles I didn't want to be the one to say LUL
[2:14:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:34] <dds333a> LUL
[2:14:36] <%jepupu> That's a vintage meme
[2:14:41] <mrblitzstream> more employees, i mean friends to fight with
[2:14:41] <johei_mctaro> the internet is a series of tubes
[2:14:41] <OblivionSword1> more demon slots
[2:14:42] <+chief_chongo> toobs on toobs
[2:14:42] <@Solidus_113> Why can't Metroid crawl
[2:14:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> Demon slots
[2:14:49] <Applecannon63> Are they Great Balls of Tubes?
[2:14:49] <+Siadore_> demon sloots
[2:14:57] <brisk_dacat> Tubes are Tubular
[2:14:57] <dds333a> you got more space
[2:14:59] <drunken_lemur> Nice!
[2:15:03] <tolloponik> pokeballs
[2:15:07] <Am_Shigar00> Bigger parties
[2:15:11] <+BignanasTheGawd> cant stop, addicted to the shindig
[2:15:13] <DedlokPM> I mean, if you could roll into balls you too would also build a network of tubes to traverse through
[2:15:29] <Am_Shigar00> I wonder what it's like actually in those tubes.
[2:15:35] <tolloponik> is this emulation btw?
[2:15:38] <+chief_chongo> i wanna be-ho and strong ho
[2:16:00] <+JupiterDjin> Strong in the ways of the ho
[2:16:03] <+Siadore_> Damn that battle transition is quick
[2:16:04] <Murdercles> also scout does not tell you every demon in the area necessarily LUL
[2:16:16] <+Siadore_> played every other smt game but DS myself
[2:16:52] <andre11dr> @siadore_ Even the old ones
[2:16:57] <dds333a> indeed
[2:16:58] <andre11dr> Like 1 and 2
[2:17:08] <+Siadore_> yes sir finished SMT 1 SNES translation
[2:17:15] <+Javaa01> Yeah it just tells you what the RNG is weighted towards
[2:17:19] <Phob05> Noice
[2:17:20] <Murdercles> yea the Orthus is only on the other side of the dragon jaw
[2:17:34] <andre11dr> Cause those games did NOT age great, i personally couldn't finish 1
[2:17:41] <OblivionSword1> is that leanan sidhe ?
[2:17:50] <arofllol> 1 and 2 are easy to break, the hard part is navigation
[2:17:53] <dds333a> sure is
[2:17:54] <+Siadore_> There is a PS1 version of 1 that has a better OST but it isn't translated to english
[2:17:55] <Phob05> Did you beat SMT 2 and if so is there a trick to the combat?
[2:18:00] <Am_Shigar00> I've heard the GBA version of SMT 1 is the best version, though I'm not 100% sure why
[2:18:15] <Phob05> sevral things
[2:18:23] <+Siadore_> Negative I got like 30% done SMT2 didn't do anything really different from 1
[2:18:24] <andre11dr> I did beat 2 ,it's pretty easy to break
[2:18:38] <+FOGSHIE> Why did it just say Joestar?
[2:18:48] <Am_Shigar00> Woolie named his character Johei Joestar
[2:18:50] <johei_mctaro> his name is johei joestar
[2:18:51] <Phob05> For some reason I've had a much harder time with it that 1
[2:18:54] <arofllol> 2 was only challenging during lucifer fight and law final dungeon
[2:18:54] <+FOGSHIE> hehehe
[2:19:03] <andre11dr> I feel like they weren't expecting you to grind for the op spells back then
[2:19:20] <arofllol> well, on neutral that is
[2:19:28] <johei_mctaro> never grind in a jrpg, just carry on forward
[2:19:32] <Am_Shigar00> I haven't played it, but I've heard fusion was stupid broken in SMT2.
[2:19:32] <arofllol> I'd imagine having satan or lucifer on the other routes helps
[2:19:41] <andre11dr> I did Chaos on 2
[2:19:48] <+Siadore_> I was going for Law in 2
[2:19:59] <+Siadore_> we are at odds
[2:20:16] <Phob05> I'm up to the meeting with Oberon
[2:20:18] <dds333a> eagle eared listeners will notice how similar Kamoshida's castle sounds to the Dark World theme.
[2:20:26] <+Siadore_> 1 and 2 would be perfect for 3DS remake or something like that
[2:20:26] <Onamar> At that point they're cheap to summon, I guess
[2:20:36] <+Siadore_> or even just a 3DS port
[2:20:38] <Joestar1890> @dds333a Yep, first thing I realized when I played this game lol
[2:20:50] <Am_Shigar00> I'm curious how'd they approach a remake of 1 & 2 on modern hardware.
[2:20:51] <andre11dr> I did Chaos because the idea of fighting YHVH seemed so cool
[2:20:59] <Phob05> 1 & 2 WHERE ported to the switch but only in Japan
[2:21:00] <andre11dr> And it was
[2:21:18] <dds333a> @andre11dr to be fair, you fight him no matter what LUL
[2:21:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:21:25] <+Siadore_> Damn I didn't know @Phob05 maybe fan translations in the future
[2:21:25] <%blacksoap65> Azumi moans when it dies
[2:21:28] <Am_Shigar00> YHVH is kind of a dick.
[2:21:35] <andre11dr> Tho he's design is pretty lame, they definitely improved him a lot in IV
[2:22:32] <andre11dr> @dds333a Yeah i didn't know that, i was told you have to go Chaos to fight him
[2:23:03] <%moonmintparadise> it is weird that the fish monster is like a grandma
[2:23:09] <dds333a> @andre11dr yeah, fair, there's always so much stuff I miss playing blind on a first playthrough
[2:23:13] <Am_Shigar00> honestly, I do kind of wish the routes in these games were more distinct, but I get why they aren't. It's a lot of work to put in for stuff that most people won't see.
[2:23:13] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Its a rare demon
[2:23:19] <Phob05> Someone is making a fan remake of SMT if... in Unity
[2:23:33] <Am_Shigar00> I've been following that. It looks kind of neat honestly for what it is.
[2:23:36] <dds333a> the most distinct routes as it stands is in DeSu
[2:23:56] <+Siadore_> SMT if also has a PS1 version like SMT1 but again no english fan translation
[2:23:58] <andre11dr> If was the jank 3d one or is that NINE?
[2:24:11] <Am_Shigar00> Nine is the 3D one
[2:24:14] <andre11dr> I always confuse those two
[2:24:21] <arofllol> yea I played the PSX version, but it's not much of an improvement
[2:24:28] <Phob05> NINE was only on Xbox
[2:24:38] <dds333a> and jp only at that
[2:24:45] <Am_Shigar00> If is essentially Persona 0 in concept, and SMT 2.5 in the mainlines.
[2:24:57] <Phob05> So a who 12 people could even buy it
[2:25:04] <Phob05> whole
[2:25:49] <%blacksoap65> So Persona a spin off of SMT?
[2:25:54] <sodamin1> yep
[2:25:56] <andre11dr> Yes
[2:25:57] <Am_Shigar00> Yup
[2:26:00] <dds333a> @blacksoap65 Kappa
[2:26:14] <arofllol> yea it's a jack bros spinoff
[2:26:31] <%blacksoap65> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:26:51] <Phob05> Persona comes after SMT if...
[2:26:55] <Sonicdy> Kappa
[2:27:00] <Phob05> The main character even makes a cameo
[2:27:27] <dds333a> @phob05 Tamaki who Kappa
[2:27:32] <Applecannon63> Look I don't know that demon
[2:27:45] <Phob05> Hee Who?
[2:27:51] <Applecannon63> I didn't have sexual relations with that demon

[2:43:26] <dds333a> her own shoe LUL
[2:43:50] <xeros720> i think in the sequel raidou does get paid, but it's by the people atthe temple
[2:43:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> He got an advance when he first started and hasn't gotten a paycheck since. sad scene
[2:44:00] <time_axis> @johei_mctaro narumi gave him like 2000 yen at the beginning of last chapter
[2:44:02] <+Siadore_> raidou is like dante when he gets handed the money it disappears IF they make any

[2:44:51] <dds333a> also, watch demon purchases
[2:44:54] <%heartlesshealer> it's okay to wait until after fusion fun for the gun clips
[2:44:57] <dds333a> but yeah

[2:45:16] <%heartlesshealer> it is useful, yeah

[2:45:21] <%livlinn> hai yai

[2:45:35] <johei_mctaro> they can't even pretend it's not fucked up this time
[2:45:38] <dds333a> a well placed shot will stop most demons in their tracks
[2:46:05] <Applecannon63> oh no execution fusion‚Ä¶
[2:46:08] <%heartlesshealer> not exp, but ability-only fusions here with Sacrifice
[2:46:21] <emper0rner0> God why isn't sacrifice in every smt game? It feels so bad to have to just trash demons you don't want
[2:46:25] <dds333a> sometimes, it raises stats too
[2:46:35] <Applecannon63> oh wait so like gacha feeding
[2:46:36] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[2:46:40] <dds333a> negligible, really,
[2:46:46] <mrblitzstream> Foodie Raidou: "ONly the best food for my demons"
[2:47:43] <%heartlesshealer> so close to moh shuvuu
[2:47:54] <Am_Shigar00> c'moooon, moh shuvuu.
[2:47:56] <sakuraasouls> Pyro Jack is adorable potato276PotatoFengLove
[2:48:06] <xeros720> yeah, it's only chapter 2 after all, not getting fancy yet
[2:48:06] <dds333a> no, that's just P5, I think LUL
[2:48:22] <dds333a> also, Sun and Strength just break the game in P5
[2:48:28] <OblivionSword1> Yea Orthus
[2:49:08] <Am_Shigar00> doggo
[2:49:14] <+pectusumbra> that's a lot of magic though
[2:49:17] <%heartlesshealer> losing ice and wind to get a healing fire
[2:49:23] <Applecannon63> ORTHORUS VULCAN
[2:49:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:49:57] <BlackermanZX> you could just catch another poltergeist
[2:50:06] <+JupiterDjin> At that stre though, he's not much a healer
[2:50:12] <+pectusumbra> yeah I dunno, I wouldn't do that. that poltergeist has so much magic
[2:50:22] <RaiNiMayonnaise> you can using command
[2:50:36] <%heartlesshealer> they will learn
[2:50:46] <Bonebagmel> bye fishman
[2:50:49] <emper0rner0> Is there a reason that in some smt games wind is Zan and sometimes its Garu?
[2:51:03] <BlackermanZX> friends forever huh kolOOF
[2:51:05] <dds333a> At a certain point it is skippable LUL
[2:51:10] <%livlinn> doggo!
[2:51:13] <Phob05> Zan is force Garu is wind and it's mostly just flavoring
[2:51:14] <Murdercles> you can press start to skip
[2:51:15] <johei_mctaro> who wants to skip cutscenes, it's the mid 2000s
[2:51:22] <enerkaizer> woolie turning into sean connery for a second there LUL
[2:51:24] <dds333a> @emper0rner0 they like to switch it
[2:51:31] <emptyantics> Sean Connery LUL
[2:51:31] <%heartlesshealer> yeah it's flavoring, like the two types of Earth spells in some SMT games
[2:51:42] <Am_Shigar00> I think Garu is mainly a Persona thing, a few other games use Garu, but 9/10 times expect to see Zan.
[2:51:44] <Applecannon63> OTHORUS VULCAN! Awakening the Instincts of Two Beasr Long Lost
[2:51:44] <Treasure_Vault> So they've been totally ignoring chat?
[2:52:02] <dds333a> in early SMT games, Force wasn't just wind, it also had to do with fundamental forces,
[2:52:11] <dds333a> big heals
[2:52:20] <OblivionSword1> medium heal
[2:52:31] <%heartlesshealer> Diarahan is strongest single target heal
[2:52:35] <Am_Shigar00> I've heard that SMT III was the game to start really associating Zan with wind, though I can't say for sure.

[2:54:16] <mrblitzstream> HARDCORE EDO the place to be
[2:54:18] <Phob05> Taru is attack raku is defense and suku is agility
[2:54:20] <andre11dr> It's really important too LUL
[2:54:23] <brisk_dacat> Is woolie trying to Devil Cast??
[2:54:23] <SirDogBear> Thats why going Ice 1, Ice 2, Ice 3 etc is not necessarily a bad thing LUL
[2:54:24] <%Lion_kun> Matarunda
[2:54:24] <+JFrostyBeats> it seems like smt 5 going to add a new tier of offensive spells

[2:54:29] <%Lion_kun> Sakakuja
[2:54:35] <emptyantics> @phob05 Neat i‚Äôll have to remember that
[2:54:37] <%Lion_kun> Masasakakuja
[2:54:37] <dds333a> mute, usually
[2:54:37] <+pectusumbra> should be a mute?
[2:54:41] <%heartlesshealer> Makajam is silence I think
[2:54:42] <jimmytwofeet> What do you mean it's hard to distinguish between Sukukaja and Sukujaka
[2:54:43] <%elderpunch> sukukaja
[2:54:45] <Am_Shigar00> Maragidyne and Mararagidyne.
[2:54:48] <andre11dr> Just remember that Makakaja is the best one
[2:54:54] <%elderpunch> makakaja
[2:54:55] <dds333a> although, a few games have it be curse
[2:55:01] <%elderpunch> tarunda
[2:55:04] <arofllol> tetrakarn makarakarn Kappa
[2:55:13] <arofllol> feat. tetraja
[2:55:17] <Phob05> But what does paraladi do?
[2:55:18] <%heartlesshealer> the karn spells on enemies NotLikeThis
[2:55:19] <%Lion_kun> The best one is heat riser and debilitate lol
[2:55:40] <arofllol> get your traesto and traport too Kappa
[2:55:42] <%heartlesshealer> Tetraja is just an escape rope, iirc?
[2:55:44] <andre11dr> What is the disability one called again?
[2:55:44] <dds333a> @lion_kun the former should be Luster Candy Kappa
[2:55:55] <Murdercles> sacrifice in this game is ass
[2:55:56] <dds333a> Tetraja is to block instant death
[2:56:00] <%heartlesshealer> oh!
[2:56:01] <Murdercles> never worth
[2:56:06] <+JFrostyBeats> luster candy is better than heat riser.
[2:56:11] <%heartlesshealer> I must be thinking of Traesto then
[2:56:15] <xeros720> yeah, i completely forget sacrifice was in this game
[2:56:21] <dds333a> @heartlesshealer you are correct
[2:56:22] <%kyh9> Oh hey
[2:56:27] <%kyh9> Idris Elba is going to be Knuckles
[2:56:28] <vermillionmars> @andre11dr debilitate?
[2:56:33] <johei_mctaro> what does mag mean
[2:56:36] <andre11dr> Oh right
[2:56:36] <Phob05> The unique spells is where the names fall apart especially in old games where they don't tell you what's what
[2:56:42] <Am_Shigar00> And then SMT IV apocalypse gave us Combat Tara which is Luster candy, but cheaper.
[2:56:43] <%kyh9> Heimdall singing Pumpkin Hill rap
[2:56:47] <arofllol> don't mix up your recarmdra and samarecarm 4Head
[2:56:47] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:56:50] <andre11dr> I thought it had a wierd name too
[2:57:14] <%heartlesshealer> Using Recarmdra with your last demon :)
[2:57:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[2:57:20] <dds333a> @arofllol especially Recarmdra effects too LUL
[2:57:26] <%kyh9> My name is Knuckes, and I don't fuckle
[2:57:32] <xeros720> yeah, ginza right?
[2:57:39] <dds333a> in some games it drops health to 1, in others, it outright kills
[2:57:45] <+pectusumbra> We'll need Woolie vs. Eternal Darkness if this spell-talk keeps up
[2:57:56] <Am_Shigar00> Pargon pargon pargon
[2:58:24] <dds333a> @johei_mctaro it stands for Magnetite, it's a demon summoning resource
[2:58:34] <andre11dr> It's always wierd going back to Nocturne and not having Mind Charge
[2:58:39] <dds333a> cmonBruh
[2:58:55] <johei_mctaro> @dds333a thanks
[2:58:56] <+pectusumbra> mind control?
[2:58:58] <andre11dr> It's just makes Strength so much op
[2:59:03] <dds333a> @johei_mctaro np
[2:59:09] <Am_Shigar00> Strength is disgusting in III.
[2:59:32] <Phob05> Luois isn't in this game is he?
[2:59:42] <dds333a> @phob05 no
[2:59:45] <andre11dr> Nah
[2:59:45] <Am_Shigar00> nope
[2:59:45] <Phob05> ok

[3:00:03] <OblivionSword1> eh Mokoi
[3:00:03] <johei_mctaro> the baggage flag
[3:00:04] <Am_Shigar00> MOKOI!
[3:00:07] <Onamar> You have enough room for a couple spells in 3 along with the physical stuff so its a lot harder to be useless with a str build
[3:00:11] <BaslerJones> this game is actually cool because its the taisho era
[3:00:21] <BaslerJones> emperor Taisho was a fucking amazing general
[3:00:29] <BaslerJones> as opposed to his fuck up son hirohito
[3:01:05] <johei_mctaro> Takahashi Meijin was a real guy known for fast button mashing. He was something of a Taito rep, and the protagonist of Adventure Island (no, really)
[3:01:14] <+pectusumbra> loose change?
[3:01:14] <Am_Shigar00> I love Mokoi and his little boomerang.
[3:01:17] <dds333a> LUL
[3:01:24] <+JupiterDjin> Lose change? Hobo Demon
[3:01:31] <Phob05> I think this game takes place in an extended Taisho era
[3:01:33] <dds333a> a friend of mine called it a discount Gumby
[3:01:47] <johei_mctaro> or was it Hudson
[3:02:16] <+JupiterDjin> I don't think he has the skill yet does he
[3:02:19] <johei_mctaro> that thing looks like it hates existing

[3:02:51] <dds333a> I mentioned it last session, but I love the translation in this game LUL
[3:02:53] <andre11dr> It could have a worse living
[3:02:55] <xeros720> the size of that lad
[3:03:02] <linSP> no janes
[3:03:06] <Applecannon63> doggo
[3:03:09] <Am_Shigar00> Mokoi just moves to the beat of his own drum
[3:03:09] <BaslerJones> cant the civs see the daemuns
[3:03:22] <dds333a> @baslerjones nope
[3:03:35] <andre11dr> As opposed to Pisaca which has a mouth for gut and is always hungry
[3:03:41] <mrblitzstream> LUL
[3:03:45] <+JupiterDjin> First fight and it's already bad
[3:03:50] <mrblitzstream> Doggo doing his best
[3:04:02] <johei_mctaro> only ds can see the demons, unless they send you to the dark realm
[3:04:05] <dds333a> @andre11dr he's the best
[3:04:17] <PMda2nd> null null null

[3:04:42] <dds333a> @calamity2007 lates
[3:04:45] <Am_Shigar00> He's doing his best
[3:04:52] <sporeian94> I woolie playing this on a ps2 or emulated?
[3:04:54] <mrblitzstream> @Calamity2007 Later man good night/day
[3:04:58] <johei_mctaro> oh shit color
[3:05:08] <brisk_dacat> Big Dumb Dog
[3:05:08] <andre11dr> Hmm what would be my favorite demon, it's honestly hard to pick
[3:05:24] <andre11dr> Chernobog is pretty cool
[3:05:41] <dds333a> @andre11dr true, good pick
[3:05:51] <Am_Shigar00> Mara is always my favorite. I have like 3 lv. 99 of them on street pass on my 3DS games.
[3:05:52] <%meatman_noplan> Trumpeter is cool
[3:05:56] <xeros720> i like the later forms of jack frost a lot
[3:05:59] <mrblitzstream> @andre11dr mine is definately Jack Frost
[3:05:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> Beelzebub for me
[3:06:06] <andre11dr> Also Cthulu, he has a dick for a tongue
[3:06:10] <%heartlesshealer> Was Belobog ever in any of the games, or just Chernobog?
[3:06:17] <xeros720> the guys like frost ace or demo-neeho
[3:06:21] <%thecraye> hell biker, people
[3:06:22] <Phob05> I like Fafnir
[3:06:29] <BlackermanZX> the chad walk
[3:06:30] <dds333a> @heartlesshealer just the latter, I feel
[3:06:33] <johei_mctaro> do they explain why so many western demons are in japan? did they just arrive with the culture?
[3:06:43] <dds333a> @phob05 also a beast pick
[3:06:52] <Am_Shigar00> @heartlesshealer Appearntly Belobog is in If and Demikids
[3:06:53] <%heartlesshealer> Missed opportunity, but understandable. They did good with Chernobog's design
[3:06:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> Belobog was in DemiKids apparently LUL
[3:06:57] <andre11dr> Honestly Satan has a really rad design as well
[3:06:58] <%heartlesshealer> oh!
[3:06:59] <Phob05> They came through a teleporter designed by the Japanese in 1
[3:07:09] <%heartlesshealer> I'll have to look at If's demon list then
[3:07:18] <dds333a> @andre11dr all several of his LUL
[3:07:32] <andre11dr> Yeah but you know the best one
[3:07:39] <Am_Shigar00> Satan's design is pretty sweet. I'm quite fond of his IV Apocalypse design
[3:07:41] <brunoberserk> cerberus in SMT1 is the MC's dog fused with a demon right ?
[3:07:44] <andre11dr> Six tits Snake
[3:07:51] <Am_Shigar00> yup, hence why it only has one head
[3:07:51] <Phob05> Correct
[3:07:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> Yes, Pascal the Dog is here.
[3:08:12] <Phob05> He also appears in SMT 2
[3:08:23] <johei_mctaro> so that's why he never has the heads
[3:08:34] <andre11dr> He dose in DDS
[3:08:41] <dds333a> yeaj, only the devil summoner era design has the heads, as well as dds
[3:08:54] <+FuqBoiSlim> Mokoi got that John Lennon walk üö∂‚ôÄÔ∏è
[3:08:56] <dds333a> single head Cerberus is just iconic
[3:08:57] <Am_Shigar00> SMT III has an easter egg conversation between Orthus and Cerberus where the former asks him why he only has one head.
[3:10:05] <andre11dr> I wish they brought Bael back
[3:10:16] <andre11dr> Such a creepy wierdi
[3:10:19] <dds333a> Also, which one LUL
[3:10:28] <brunoberserk> the first  nes megami tensei is based on a book/novel , i read that book and BOY thats a REALLY fucked up story
[3:10:30] <andre11dr> Bael ,not Baal
[3:10:34] <linSP> What kinda monster fuses their dog with a demon, lookin at u smt 1
[3:10:46] <enerkaizer> yes
[3:10:49] <andre11dr> The one with the frog head and spider legs
[3:10:56] <dds333a> Rickshaws are mostly just tourist attractions, now
[3:11:05] <Am_Shigar00> SMT 1 does a lot of effed up stuff with fusions
[3:11:19] <%livlinn> woolieACCIDENT
[3:11:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:11:23] <Phob05> There's Ophanim who I also wish came back
[3:11:37] <%thedankestmeeme> theres rickshaws here in Houston in think its like a company thing tho
[3:11:42] <andre11dr> He was in Apocalypse wasn't he
[3:11:44] <johei_mctaro> could have... you know... gone to the narumi detective agency
[3:11:50] <dds333a> so many Angels just go ignored, it sucks
[3:12:22] <Dakuu75> lol
[3:12:26] <dds333a> LUL
[3:12:54] <Phob05> Apparently Ophanim was in Persona Q
[3:13:07] <+FuqBoiSlim> I wish the section in p5 where you fight the archangels used the IV DLC designs but I get why they went with the human designs
[3:13:09] <%Tearonex> this game looks great for a PS2 game
[3:13:12] <andre11dr> Even in Nocturne which doesn't have that many law demons there still pretty much have everyone but the Cerubin and Ophanim
[3:13:20] <%Atomik456> Atomik456 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 17 month streak! love this game, still got the jack frost plush that came with the sequel
[3:13:34] <Am_Shigar00> I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of SMT IV's designs have copyright issues with their artists.
[3:13:39] <johei_mctaro> stylized models and rendered backgrounds
[3:13:41] <andre11dr> Like every anglel tier up to the Throne
[3:13:44] <xeros720> bold of you to assume raidou gets a salary
[3:14:04] <dds333a> This right here is the Dragon of Ginza
[3:14:05] <Phob05> There where some designs that came back for Apocalyse but where redrawn by Doi
[3:14:20] <Phob05> Medusa for one
[3:14:22] <Am_Shigar00> Doi's redesigns did wonders for Medusa's design
[3:14:32] <Phob05> It sure did!
[3:14:37] <%Atomik456> what's the story with the 4 designs?
[3:14:53] <dds333a> I'm partial to the Nirasawa artwork, unfortunately LUL
[3:14:58] <dds333a> love his work
[3:15:01] <andre11dr> Some of Dois designs where huge improvements but other, i just don't get
[3:15:10] <andre11dr> Like Lucifer and Satan
[3:15:15] <xeros720> donpachi
[3:15:19] <%Drunkengen> Kenpachi Ramasama?
[3:15:23] <%jonblnt> jonblnt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! just got off of work. Let's Go!
[3:15:23] <Dakuu75> Kenpachi Rama Sama~
[3:15:34] <andre11dr> I am not a fan of the Apocalypse version of those demons
[3:15:35] <Applecannon63> pachi means head?
[3:15:38] <%Drunkengen> Shinpachi
[3:15:55] <Phob05> Fair enough
[3:15:59] <xeros720> you think you have enough cash for a sit down restaurant like that?
[3:16:06] <Am_Shigar00> I like Satan's design, but I'm in agreement with Lucifer.
[3:16:26] <%heartlesshealer> the walk is great
[3:16:31] <Phob05> I don't really like either Lucy design
[3:16:33] <andre11dr> 7 head Satan is cool but is better than snake tits Satan, no he's not
[3:16:54] <dds333a> LUL
[3:16:58] <Am_Shigar00> That's totally fair
[3:17:02] <Phob05> Tiamat Satan
[3:17:05] <mrblitzstream> LUL
[3:17:12] <Applecannon63> But Snake tits Satan is cool tho‚Ä¶
[3:17:24] <xeros720> yeah, in japan there's enough of them, but there's definitely a few with that level of prestige in kyoto and stuff
[3:17:29] <mrblitzstream> cant go wrong with a snek
[3:17:40] <linSP> I‚Äôm glad they put tits Satan in p5
[3:17:40] <andre11dr> However final form Yawee is fucking awesome, probably one of my favorite final bosses from a visual standpoint
[3:17:47] <%Atomik456> it varies, a one star michelin place will often be walk in as long as you aren;t like going friday night
[3:17:51] <Am_Shigar00> Of course, everyone knows the best Lucifer design is Lucifrost.
[3:18:00] <andre11dr> So much better than dumb yellow heads
[3:18:06] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 you know it
[3:18:14] <+thedannydarko> Is this on PS3?
[3:18:20] <Am_Shigar00> It is
[3:18:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:18:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> @thedannydarko psn store yea
[3:18:29] <%Atomik456> hell with covid a lot are gonna be happy eith anyone showing up lol
[3:18:35] <dds333a> DT Super Stinger LUL
[3:18:37] <+thedannydarko> I had this in my backlog, I didn‚Äôt realize it looked so pretty
[3:18:40] <Phob05> I figured the idea behind Satan's design is that he's like all the things people are afraid of or dislike is a religious sense
[3:18:51] <xeros720> yeah, for a ps2 game, the rendered backgrounds still look good
[3:19:19] <dds333a> @phob05 likely idea. I always interpreted his design as befitting a tempter,
[3:19:49] <andre11dr> @phob05 His a serpent with six wing ,six arms ,six tits ,666
[3:19:56] <andre11dr> Do you get it
[3:20:03] <andre11dr> EEEEEVVVVVIIIIIILLLLL
[3:20:29] <Phob05> Satan's exposed breasts made the child uncomfortable
[3:20:31] <xeros720> also more wings means a more powerful angel, so in some forms they like to emphasize the fallen angel aspect
[3:20:33] <Applecannon63> I like that for how symmetrical
[3:21:06] <Am_Shigar00> good boy mokoi. There's a reason you're one of Raidou's canon demons.
[3:21:42] <dds333a> here he comes LUL
[3:21:51] <andre11dr> Never mind that he helped me beat up Nix ,no different timeline ,shut up
[3:21:59] <xeros720> speaking of, this game got a decent manga
[3:22:00] <+pectusumbra> woolie 'ghost shooter' madden
[3:22:18] <dds333a> @andre11dr oh yeah, he's always been a big help LUL
[3:22:50] <dds333a> Althougg, fusing Satan in a first plaything is a tall order LUL, he's very NG
[3:22:55] <+mikeabbages> I've heard so much praise for smt, but idk what it is! Is this a DS game?
[3:23:02] <andre11dr> And then there's Satanel which i don't even know what to make of him
[3:23:17] <Phob05> He's...big
[3:23:21] <andre11dr> His like the hipster Satan
[3:23:26] <Am_Shigar00> @mikeabbages It is a spin-off of SMT, and is an action RPG set in the 1920s.
[3:23:32] <Phob05> I like Helel more
[3:23:35] <dds333a> @mikeabbages if by "DS" you mean Devil summoner, then yes Kappa
[3:23:57] <+mikeabbages> lol, gotcha. It looks rad!
[3:24:03] <Am_Shigar00> I always love how tiny your huge demons are compared to enemy huge demons
[3:24:06] <Applecannon63> Satanael is just Satan but as a gentlemen with a big ass gun
[3:24:39] <Am_Shigar00> Isn't Satanael more of a Lucifer than a Satan?
[3:24:52] <straycatrock> this game has the strongest PS2 Jank ever i love it so much
[3:25:05] <dds333a> Pretty much, although in actual Gnosticism, Satanael doesn't entirely correspond to the Abrahamic Satan
[3:25:24] <dds333a> I can't say more since it's honestly all greek to me
[3:25:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1424943441079832577?s=19
[3:25:27] <andre11dr> I mean you need Satan and Lucifer to get him
[3:25:45] <shadowray7> in mainline, Satan and Lucifer tend to hate each other
[3:26:36] <andre11dr> Well Satan was made by the Great Will so that's why Lucifer hates him
[3:27:18] <andre11dr> Even tho he also was created by the Great Will
[3:27:24] <dds333a> Lucifer is just still salty YHVH beat his ass fair and square, and kicked him out of Heaven LUL
[3:28:00] <andre11dr> Depends which Lucifer it is
[3:28:13] <%elderpunch> whatd i miss chat
[3:28:28] <andre11dr> Cause SMT IV Lucifer, kinda of a loser
[3:28:43] <Am_Shigar00> SMT IV Lucifer is officially a chump.
[3:28:48] <%elderpunch> SMT IV lucifer is whack
[3:28:53] <dds333a> @elderpunch they've explored the daidouji estate, fought two sub bosses and a boss, and are now exploring Ginza
[3:28:58] <andre11dr> Nocturne Lucifer was way stronger and smarter
[3:29:08] <BurdRightsActivist> Smt 4 Lucifer is squidward
[3:29:22] <Phob05> 4 Lucy is also a massive buzzkill
[3:29:53] <dds333a> and get some cash
[3:29:59] <Am_Shigar00> thanks Mokoi!
[3:30:11] <andre11dr> Helel is pretty cool , he doesn't show up much tho
[3:30:25] <Am_Shigar00> I mainly remember Helel from Persona.
[3:30:33] <%elderpunch> @dds333a coo
[3:30:51] <%elderpunch> have yall been watching the smt v demon presentations?
[3:31:01] <andre11dr> No

[3:31:53] <Am_Shigar00> That's the first time I've ever heard that about him. I've seen nothing but love and lust everywhere else
[3:31:55] <andre11dr> He looks like he belongs in FE
[3:32:01] <Phob05> Compared to the other protags, sure.
[3:32:07] <dds333a> gotta shake em down
[3:32:20] <johei_mctaro> make this man part with his only worldly possesion
[3:32:23] <dds333a> PHIL COLLINS LUL

[3:34:37] <dds333a> you ain't seen nothin yet CarlSmile
[3:34:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Does that mean we can get Phil Collins in a Persona game?
[3:34:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> FUUUUUUCK UNITY JUST GOT PARSEC.
[3:35:28] <andre11dr> We all know Phill Collins is a deadly demon in comand of 50 0000 legions of demon
[3:35:33] <johei_mctaro> @AlteisenReiseZ elaborate
[3:35:37] <Phob05> Does Woolie know about repositioning demons?
[3:35:49] <andre11dr> You just didn't pay attention to that part of the Ars Goeta
[3:35:51] <dds333a> @phob05 he does, he's rarely used it for now
[3:35:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @johei_mctaro Unity just bought the Parsec team
[3:36:00] <Am_Shigar00> oh boy
[3:36:02] <johei_mctaro> depressing
[3:36:02] <Phob05> okay

[3:37:14] <+NopeBadguy> LUL
[3:37:19] <+NopeBadguy> bad dog
[3:37:19] <dds333a> LUL c
[3:37:31] <andre11dr> Dogo bad
[3:37:48] <andre11dr> No souls for you today
[3:39:37] <+NopeBadguy> hmhmhmhmhm
[3:40:04] <Applecannon63> RyuChamp
[3:40:08] <Am_Shigar00> heh
[3:40:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:40:18] <Am_Shigar00> there we go
[3:40:23] <dds333a> nearly missed it LUL
[3:40:44] <Phob05> I'm reminded of the time A German Spy was cry-laughing at the Nekomata death sound in Raidou 2
[3:40:50] <andre11dr> So i just refreshed my memory on Orthrus ,he was a apparently a two headed dog that attacked the rong cattle and got punked out by Heracles
[3:40:54] <%jonblnt> how far into the game is this
[3:41:00] <Am_Shigar00> Still pretty early
[3:41:01] <Phob05> Early
[3:41:07] <dds333a> @phob05 and it is hilarious LUL
[3:41:13] <dds333a> he's on Ch.2
[3:41:43] <Am_Shigar00> good boy
[3:41:51] <+SolarisStardust> ayyy it's Raidou from the Raidou may Vs series
[3:43:25] <time_axis> It was a new area that unlocked
[3:43:43] <dds333a> is he trying to find Denpachi LUL
[3:43:49] <Phob05> Maybe
[3:43:50] <Spirit_9B> sounds like Aris's laugh
[3:44:12] <Phob05> Denpachi lives near the red light district
[3:44:17] <andre11dr> Some of these demon noises are very....orgasmic
[3:44:59] <Am_Shigar00> I often wonder if any of these demon noises are recorded by professional actors if they just throw some employees into the recording booth.
[3:46:03] <dds333a> yeah, she's eating it up LUL
[3:46:16] <andre11dr> I assume in the later games where there's are fully voiced, they get some professional voice actors
[3:46:39] <sylphyyyy> hey woolie and reggie and chat, how you all doing
[3:46:46] <Am_Shigar00> I definetly know SMT IV had actual proper actors for at least the dub. Laura Bailey does the Alice lines.
[3:46:49] <dds333a> p good
[3:47:00] <mrblitzstream> chilling
[3:47:08] <andre11dr> But in this one they might've just grabbed some dude off the street and went, "give us your best Beelzebub impression"
[3:47:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:47:27] <brisk_dacat> Idris Elba is gonna be playing knuckles in the sonic movie.
[3:47:40] <sylphyyyy> that's good to hear sylphy1Sass I am hoping to wind down to chill with you all
[3:47:58] <mrblitzstream> @brisk_dacat not gonna lie prtyy hyped for the new movie coming up
[3:48:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> maybe YOU can, I never run
[3:48:21] <dds333a> never my style LUL
[3:48:28] <sylphyyyy> I cannot believe Idris Elba is about to play the most dumbass role of his life considering he usually plays such serious characters lol
[3:48:37] <sylphyyyy> hope he has fun
[3:48:40] <%M3djedx> woolieSPICE
[3:48:49] <dds333a> Reg knows LUL
[3:49:06] <brisk_dacat> @sylphyyyy Dumb makes that moneyüí∞
[3:49:07] <Applecannon63> I wish there was an option that turns off random encounters like ff9
[3:49:16] <%kewlmyc> Oh god, I though y'all were joking about Elba playing Knuckles.
[3:49:19] <Applecannon63> or an item
[3:49:20] <Am_Shigar00> @Applecannon63 Bravely Default has your back
[3:49:25] <brunoberserk> idris elba as knuckles , boy thats a STRONG  meme potencial
[3:49:32] <sylphyyyy> now kewl, it's really real LUL he posted it
[3:49:44] <andre11dr> Sometimes in life you gotta take that paycheck, ask Patrick Stewart
[3:50:01] <mrblitzstream> ask vin diesel and his GROOT
[3:50:05] <dds333a> Mark Hamill knows that too
[3:50:08] <sylphyyyy> patrick stewart's christmas carol lol
[3:50:11] <%kewlmyc> I literally just got done watching The Suicide Squad and came straight here.
[3:50:11] <%SirGO0SE> @andre11dr NotLikeThis
[3:50:17] <sylphyyyy> I kid, that was a good rendition of the sotry
[3:50:20] <dds333a> I prefer Vin as the Iron Giant myself
[3:50:23] <Am_Shigar00> Patrick Stewart as an emoji
[3:50:33] <sylphyyyy> patrick stewart as a vtuber...
[3:50:44] <Am_Shigar00> I would totally watch Patrick Stewart as a Vturber
[3:50:48] <mrblitzstream> NotLikeThis
[3:50:51] <stoatacious> oh is this the new one?
[3:50:59] <sylphyyyy> lol anime vtuber patrick stewart
[3:51:08] <stoatacious> I didn't know it was out
[3:51:26] <dds333a> no. you're good
[3:51:31] <dds333a> this is Raidou
[3:51:31] <mrblitzstream> would his vtuber be  picard or what else....
[3:51:42] <andre11dr> But it's not a cute anime girl, it's just Patrick Stewart in an anime art style
[3:51:47] <johei_mctaro> a regular anime girl, the more generic the better
[3:51:56] <dds333a> @andre11dr sounds good to me
[3:52:03] <Am_Shigar00> Can it be a cute anime Patrick Stewart?
[3:52:14] <%Deft_Thought> Man, I'd love to see the Devil Summoner series come back with a P5 Scramble combat system
[3:52:21] <Iza_kku> this game plays a lot different than, say nocturne. not sure what i was expecting, but this looks cool
[3:52:26] <dds333a> Woolie doing the solo run already? Kappa
[3:52:31] <mrblitzstream> @andre11dr YES! this
[3:52:49] <dds333a> Welcome to the True World

[3:53:14] <Am_Shigar00> P2 yo.
[3:53:32] <Applecannon63> Rumor mechanics
[3:53:37] <andre11dr> RUMORS
[3:53:39] <dds333a> You got Rumormongers at the Smile Joint
[3:53:41] <Am_Shigar00> Heck, the agency you spread rumors in P2 was even the Kuzanoha Agency
[3:53:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> what goes around comes around woolieSPICE
[3:53:58] <OblivionSword1> Valhalla soda sounds delicious
[3:54:02] <dds333a> Also. that exchange mechanic is useless
[3:54:08] <johei_mctaro> you ever heard the rumor of the incredibly handsome guy with the huge genitals who happens to share my name?
[3:54:14] <dds333a> I never once needed to use it

[3:57:32] <mrblitzstream> and dropped out
[3:57:51] <EL_TRO> ayyy, woolie playing other smt games?
[3:58:11] <EL_TRO> wonder if he'll stream Digital Devil Saga
[3:58:21] <andre11dr> What where the types that you couldn't recruit in the other games?
[3:58:26] <time_axis> Magnetite
[3:58:26] <darkfox1995> Wish I could summon demons to cheat life
[3:58:34] <arofllol> usually Dark
[3:58:34] <andre11dr> I remember Tyrant was one

[3:58:47] <andre11dr> I think the Feme
[3:58:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> Cuno? gettin fucked on Mag?
[3:58:58] <EL_TRO> oh word
[3:59:01] <EL_TRO> oh well
[3:59:08] <Am_Shigar00> honestly Mag kind of stops being a problem after a while
[3:59:21] <%ZweihanderSteve> I love old school smt screens like this, with people standing around.
[3:59:40] <EL_TRO> cant wait for smtv
[3:59:42] <arofllol> you either end up with like 70k mag or you sell most of it LUL
[3:59:43] <andre11dr> Nah you just need to grind
[3:59:47] <dds333a> Mag is completely irrelevant, I only ran out when i deliberately tried to in order to see what eould happen
[3:59:49] <EL_TRO> looks gorgeous
[4:00:42] <andre11dr> Yeah SMT looks nice
[4:00:55] <andre11dr> The roster seems nice too
[4:01:15] <dds333a> @andre11dr and it'll definitely be huge. can't wait
[4:01:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:01:17] <andre11dr> They're bringing back a bunch of Soul Hackers and SJ stuff
[4:01:36] <dds333a> Smtiv had the most demons of the entire franchise
[4:01:47] <Am_Shigar00> I still find it funny that they're reusing UI elements from TMS. I get while, but it's so jarring.
[4:01:54] <Am_Shigar00> *I get why
[4:01:56] <dds333a> this one won't have as many since it's 3d, but it should stil lhave a tone
[4:01:58] <andre11dr> Are we going to get some of Lovecraft stuff?
[4:02:01] <dds333a> *ton
[4:02:03] <andre11dr> I wonder
[4:02:27] <andre11dr> They only really show up in P2 and SMT 2
[4:02:30] <Am_Shigar00> I'm hoping the actual fusing is as indepth as IV's.
[4:02:30] <dds333a> @andre11dr we already got byakhee and Hastur from P2, maybe we'll get some new stuff
[4:02:57] <%townzzzzz> a tall glass of soda
[4:03:01] <arofllol> ze soda Kappa
[4:03:07] <%elderpunch> @andre11dr hopefully
[4:03:11] <BaslerJones> wait did they censor soda
[4:03:17] <DSD24> Where there cacti in Japan?
[4:03:18] <BaslerJones> was soda supposed to be something else
[4:03:21] <Am_Shigar00> hmm, that's a good question.

[4:03:37] <andre11dr> It would be nice to have Cthulu back, him and his dick tongue
[4:03:53] <dds333a> but it serves other purposes, and there are TWO rumors, currently
[4:03:57] <andre11dr> Also Daigon looks awesome in SMT
[4:03:59] <BaslerJones> why would soda get you giggly
[4:04:10] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:04:14] <dds333a> classic

[4:04:31] <%livlinn> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[4:04:31] <$SulfurousAcid> @WoolieVersus the french woman said until next new moon

[4:38:33] <Ziegsy> ziegsyHoo ziegsyHoo ziegsyHoo
[4:38:35] <%kullumanati> N pass premium
[4:38:41] <Ipsenscastle> KN pass
[4:38:42] <brisk_dacat> Knuckles ain‚Äôt here to chuckle
[4:38:58] <FrostedZaibatsu> Nothing is better than the, "just leaving work" high
[4:39:00] <dds333a> nah, "Knuckles was never black-coded" Kappa
[4:39:13] <%jinking79> lot of gender swap too
[4:39:14] <dds333a> and people said this before and AFTER SA2
[4:39:30] <%elderpunch> its Jojo part 7.5
[4:39:43] <andre11dr> When do we get the futuristic Jojo?
[4:39:59] <andre11dr> Like Strange Journey but it's stands
[4:40:01] <%elderpunch> isnt jojolion in 2015 or sum
[4:40:02] <+thunderaznable> dude ippon is so cool
[4:40:03] <+JupiterDjin> Well we traded a friend
[4:40:07] <dds333a> @andre11dr technically DiU-SO LUL
[4:40:28] <time_axis> thats the best part of SMT
[4:40:32] <dds333a> Woolz is in luck, since that's very easy to do here LUL
[4:40:40] <Am_Shigar00> I remember keeping Moh Shuvuu for my entire playthrough of Raidou 1.
[4:40:49] <%elderpunch> much easier to do in SMT IV
[4:40:49] <dds333a> LUL
[4:40:55] <andre11dr> Well the best demons usually look cool
[4:40:57] <%elderpunch> my Alice is a complete nuke
[4:41:10] <Am_Shigar00> SMT IV the early demons end up becoming the best with all the level boost skills
[4:41:22] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[4:41:24] <andre11dr> Most end game demons are cool and BIG
[4:41:30] <dds333a> @elderpunch true. but he's referring to keeping "low tier" demons well past their time due to how cool they look
[4:41:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Trickle-down economics. You're stimulating the market woolz
[4:41:48] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> 80 yen for the train in 1931 seems like a lot
[4:41:54] <andre11dr> Except stuff like Vishnu and Shiva of course
[4:42:02] <+NopeBadguy> turn this car around and pay like 200 yen for it
[4:42:04] <%elderpunch> @dds333a oh ye for sure
[4:42:04] <andre11dr> But they still look cool
[4:42:14] <%elderpunch> its just way more tedious to do in older games
[4:42:21] <dds333a> also, endgame units looking cool, is half of Digimon
[4:42:30] <dds333a> @elderpunch exactly
[4:42:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx They lopped some zeros of the end at some point right? Because inflation?
[4:42:52] <Applecannon63> Punk Cultists?

[5:10:47] <dds333a> fire always scary. really
[5:11:11] <darkfox1995> This game really gives demons a bunch of life. That the turn based games do not have
[5:11:47] <darkfox1995> The fact they get to do things other than press turn
[5:12:06] <dds333a> @darkfox1995 it does indeed, although games like DDS has plenty of demons with personality
[5:12:30] <dds333a> with quotes and everything. but the ability to move around and the like was seen in Imagine as well
[5:13:35] <dds333a> healing herself nonstop LUL
[5:14:57] <BlackermanZX> maybe where the zombie guards were standing?
[5:15:16] <dds333a> @blackermanzx Kappa

[5:17:53] <Applecannon63> is it an in battle item?
[5:18:24] <dds333a> @applecannon63 it's just ammunition for Raidou's gun
[5:18:25] <Applecannon63> uhhhhh
[5:18:26] <Am_Shigar00> speaking of Mermaid, OH MY GOD, Mermaid's personal skill in SMT V looks awesome.
[5:18:27] <andre11dr> Is this some weird fetish stuff?
[5:18:39] <dds333a> Nah, it's a sideshow LUL
[5:18:49] <dds333a> a bad one, at that
[5:18:55] <Ziegsy> There was a mermaid corpse shown around in victorian london. It was a monkey sewn to a fish
[5:19:29] <dds333a> @ziegsy yeah, and also that angel that somehow fell in Mexico
[5:19:57] <funnyfunnykid> "Yo, watch this shit!" *Heals Fully*

[5:21:01] <dds333a> LUL

[5:28:29] <andre11dr> Funny enough i usually don't use Jack Frost
[5:28:42] <andre11dr> But Black Frost is pretty useful
[5:28:43] <%livlinn> Hee hee Hoo!
[5:28:46] <+Axellogic> Give up or die, ho!
[5:28:48] <Am_Shigar00> Jack Frost is honestly pretty average as a demon
[5:28:48] <dds333a> yup, only another combo gets you something different
[5:28:55] <Am_Shigar00> Black Frost is freaking GREAT.
[5:28:59] <dds333a> now that elec boost is only for passing on
[5:29:16] <DS_ShockTrooper> Hee-ho hold the **** up!
[5:29:20] <%townzzzzz> hee ho

[5:29:56] <dds333a> he ALWAYS does LUL
[5:29:58] <Joestar1890> HEE HO
[5:29:58] <plushysceptile> He has an existential break down in another game
[5:30:10] <%townzzzzz> get them jack bros on
[5:30:14] <Am_Shigar00> He gets pissed at you if you claim to be the protagonist in IV.
[5:30:15] <stormhawk9891> "If you're such hot shit, crush this rock with your bare hands, ho."
[5:30:19] <andre11dr> Also this game has Raidhoo
[5:30:20] <%elderpunch> morgana and teddie will never replace him
[5:30:22] <+pectusumbra> he was in TMS and even shows up as an easter egg on the gunner's outfit in Etrian Odyssey 2
[5:30:27] <DS_ShockTrooper> In SMT 1 Jack Frost asks you if your top sh*t to break a rock with your bare hands.
[5:30:35] <Am_Shigar00> @andre11dr Sadly he's only in new game+
[5:30:38] <dds333a> @andre11dr they didn't have a choice. unfortunately. now it's there for passing on
[5:30:58] <dds333a> @jetfandam also, get it right, it's Rai Raiho Kappa
[5:31:08] <+AceNugget> you sure you don't have to back out more to reroll?
[5:31:09] <andre11dr> Oh so his only NG+ huh
[5:31:18] <Kira2993> you have to back out completely
[5:31:29] <time_axis> Skills only randomize when there's a pagan demon involved in the fusion.  Otherwise it depends on moon phase and is a huge pain to influence
[5:31:29] <%elderpunch> guys without spoiling which is ur favourite alignment or reason in the series
[5:31:47] <andre11dr> I think in the second game you get a sidequest and you unlock him
[5:31:59] <dds333a> @elderpunch Law, all day.
[5:32:10] <andre11dr> @elderpunch Chaos
[5:32:21] <%elderpunch> from which games tho
[5:32:31] <%elderpunch> smt iv law or desu law
[5:32:33] <Am_Shigar00> yeah, faction depth tends to differ from game to game

[5:33:28] <Am_Shigar00> I actually used Turdak all game as my red item collector.
[5:33:31] <andre11dr> Damn all you law lovers in chat, don't you want to control your destiny
[5:33:42] <andre11dr> YOU JUST WANT TO BE PUPPETS
[5:33:48] <Murdercles> well in smt4, jonathan isnt right about everything but he is not a fucking psychopath like Walter
[5:33:51] <andre11dr> FOR GOD
[5:33:57] <%elderpunch> under chaos u would actually still be a puppet
[5:33:57] <dds333a> like, in Apocalypse, it's a straight up bad ending, and I still picked it LUL
[5:34:07] <%elderpunch> just under the strong ones lmao
[5:34:08] <+Hollow_Mirage> Light-Chaos is usually preferable for me Dark-Chaos is pretty shir
[5:34:15] <Am_Shigar00> Oh Apocalypse. What a controversal game you are. I still love you though
[5:34:17] <dds333a> but in Devil Survivor. it's the absolute best
[5:34:28] <%elderpunch> Chaos isn‚Äôt actually as free as its meant to be if u think about it

[5:34:34] <andre11dr> I really liked Chaos in SJ
[5:34:44] <%elderpunch> id have to say tho law in SMT 3 (Hijiri) is an amazing reason
[5:34:53] <dds333a> also, Satan is the real Law rep SeemsGood
[5:34:56] <DS_ShockTrooper> Which version of SJ? the redux?
[5:35:17] <andre11dr> @elderpunch What, no way
[5:35:27] <andre11dr> Kiriji is an asshole
[5:35:34] <DS_ShockTrooper> lol
[5:35:37] <andre11dr> Hiriji?
