[0:01:57] <+b_aleph> Bestiality!
[0:02:00] <%Solidnick18> they hate cool names
[0:02:26] <ggbhtg> let us cling together
[0:02:27] <%thatsocrunchy> Bestiality ahoyyy!
[0:02:31] <ggbhtg> THE BEST COLLECTION
[0:02:37] <l0rd_sm3xy> we all know in our hearts what the true name is
[0:02:50] <ggbhtg> Complete Works
[0:03:51] <ggbhtg> Bloody Four
[0:03:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:03:56] <+odd_slater> Played the fuck out of Bloody Roar on Gamecube
[0:04:04] <ggbhtg> Most I hear about is Primal Fury
[0:04:14] <Make_me_mad> Bloody Roar 2 or bust.
[0:04:27] <+b_aleph> 2 is the goat
[0:04:34] <ggbhtg> I don't know if PF has the most nostalgia, or if it's tourney standard
[0:05:13] <ggbhtg> Max played BR2 last week, so I did some research to help him out
[0:05:15] <EvieOverride> I started with BR1 and all those characters that never showed up again. xD
[0:05:26] <@Solidus_113> Remember Demos?
[0:05:40] <+odd_slater> Ye you download them now :)
[0:05:41] <powerprotoman> i see were playing a beloved classic fighting game, and also bloody roar 3
[0:05:48] <ggbhtg> most importantly.....WHAT IS THE TECH?
[0:06:17] <ggbhtg> Guard Cancel your Special Moves, apparently
[0:06:33] <+odd_slater> I'm sure Bloody Roar is in the FGC discord compendium
[0:06:43] <super_harley_dude> br2 was one of my fave games
[0:06:50] <TrashLeviathan> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey bloody roar time
[0:07:02] <ggbhtg> @odd_slater There's not exactly requirements to do so
[0:07:16] <+b_aleph> Can we pray for Konami's bankruptcy so we have a shot of getting another bloody roar?
[0:07:17] <EvieOverride> Fun tidbit: Stun inherited a large chunk of his moves from Mitsuko the Boar in BR1
[0:07:34] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:07:40] <ggbhtg> there was a BOAR?
[0:07:44] <TrashLeviathan> ni oh is pog
[0:08:02] <+odd_slater> @ggbhtg For what? The discord thing?
[0:08:05] <ggbhtg> yes
[0:08:14] <%vVAstrAVv> 2 is a lot easier than 1 if that helps but i get you
[0:08:15] <%gnoame> Or just make a Killing Bites game since Killing Bites is sort of anime Bloody Roar
[0:08:22] <ggbhtg> Hitch has Summon Saltshakers at the moment
[0:08:25] <ggbhtg> and he's right to
[0:08:42] <super_harley_dude> love me some bakuryu
[0:08:45] <%Axle13j> Axle13j subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Lets gooooo
[0:08:57] <+odd_slater> Oh I just brought it up cause that google doc has a lot of discords to join
[0:09:01] <EvieOverride> A boar, a transsexual fox, and a gorilla that never showed in any of the sequels.
[0:09:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> My salt shall be ABSOLUTE (and yeah I'm not too worried either tbh, just thought I'd say it)
[0:09:07] <ggbhtg> EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED......in the base game
[0:09:08] <%Reverend_Roscoe> are they sticking to local play tonight?
[0:09:14] <ggbhtg> just not Special Edition
[0:09:32] <+b_aleph> @Reverend_Roscoe parsec
[0:09:37] <+b_aleph> allegedly
[0:09:47] <%Brightstreak> what we talking about?
[0:09:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> oh snap
[0:09:50] <+HitchhikingThrough> Oh shit right you follow me on twitter fucking wild.
[0:09:54] <Make_me_mad> Fuck those cowards for not adding playable Lady though.
[0:10:14] <Arkrados> They showed MK11 Rain too
[0:10:17] <%Solidnick18> it's pretty cool
[0:10:20] <%Irridium> I'm sad we're not getting a playable Trish. Really liked how she played in 4SE
[0:10:22] <%Solidnick18> the cards
[0:10:31] <ggbhtg> I don't recall "Ladies' Night" ever making it past rumor phase
[0:10:52] <%Solidnick18> it's nice that the store is just there now and not an app
[0:10:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:11:06] <+emeraldsplasher> Ladies Night was strictly a rumor mill, nothing confirmed @ggbhtg
[0:11:18] <@Solidus_113> The PS5 UI is still pushing a lot of social stuff nobody uses, and I doubt they'll force devs to support it
[0:11:46] <+b_aleph> gamers don't want to socialize
[0:11:48] <%Irridium> PS5 main menu looked reeeeal small. Hopefully you can enlarge those icons and text
[0:11:49] <+b_aleph> study says
[0:11:54] <+emeraldsplasher> @solidus_113 Xbox is doing the rounded UI a lot better, even the base Xbox One got the UI update
[0:12:01] <%barkon345> Am I the only one who liked Bloody Roar 2 wayyy more then Bloody Roar 3. but it seems like people only play 3 when they go back to this series
[0:12:02] <%JustYudha> LUL LUL
[0:12:02] <@Solidus_113> "UI optimized for 4k"

[0:19:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> psaHoldon
[0:19:39] <Applecannon63> Alice bends your body into a ball before playing it like football
[0:19:49] <+Amaideus> Super exhibition when
[0:19:53] <%doombawkzvs> Cheer500 Alright, I sent it from the personal on twitter so keep an eye out for it. This port should have the new universal grab and tutorials (Currently being balanced) and the Woolie character (weave is not implemented, it's an older build ver. but still have fun playing around with it). If it doesn't work just lmk and I'll try to get you a working port to load from.
[0:19:56] <SnoopuRu> Alice actually just snaps your spine into thirds lmfao
[0:20:26] <%ekodrop> roll on the ground

[0:25:35] <ggbhtg> qcb punch or kick seems to be guard breaker

[0:26:04] <%CrimsonCore90> Third Strike!!! Third strike!

[0:26:31] <eddie_hedgehog> its FINE
[0:26:41] <ggbhtg> I'm guessing qcb punch or kick, which is universal, seems to be a attack with guarding startup
[0:26:43] <%CrimsonCore90> You are okay, benefits of the manga
[0:26:47] <+b_aleph> woolie vs pcsxe2

[0:31:06] <eddie_hedgehog> calibrate
[0:31:07] <l0rd_sm3xy> @amaideus yo actualy maybe
[0:31:20] <%Mr_Strut> Can that be reconfigured?
[0:31:23] <+Amaideus> Whichever series is that one that's super balanced but also no one plays
[0:31:30] <+Amaideus> I can never remember if it's VF or not
[0:31:35] <+b_aleph> woolie vs deadzones
[0:31:38] <%ekodrop> bloody gore

[0:32:12] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus can Reggie see chat? since BR2, most inputs have been standard Street Fighter fare
[0:32:13] <eddie_hedgehog> shouldve used authentic ps2 controllers
[0:32:34] <%ekodrop> stephen king doesn't like you wollie
[0:32:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:32:39] <%Irridium> man PS2 has a lot of technical issues huh Kappa
[0:32:40] <l0rd_sm3xy> *puts on salty bet in the corner* "Were definitely playing guys, no tech problems here"
[0:32:53] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus also, in Beast mode, Shinku motions plus Beast are the two supers
[0:33:06] <ggbhtg> but there's more specifics
[0:33:22] <%ekodrop> reggie what's the status on your streaming career
[0:33:26] <%Solidnick18> oh i can see the config in the glass lol
[0:33:36] <ggbhtg> What I'm seeing is that Punch + Kick is to tech
[0:33:39] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't think Reggie has built his computer yet
[0:33:44] <+b_aleph> woolie vs breaks

[0:37:23] <KaironFortressKnight> aaaaah dmc5 is so good
[0:37:29] <%Josef_Stryker> It's the best
[0:37:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> ALL THESE VOICE INSIDE OF MY HEAD
[0:37:47] <%Solidnick18> can't wait to replay dmc5 again
[0:37:51] <+HitchhikingThrough> BANG BANG BANG
[0:37:58] <%Solidnick18> BANG
[0:38:00] <%Irridium> final battle of DMCV special edition better be you as Vergil vs Nero
[0:38:01] <%Josef_Stryker> BANG BANG, BANG
[0:38:02] <KaironFortressKnight> hey Hitch
[0:38:04] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:38:08] <+HitchhikingThrough> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[0:38:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> @KaironFortressKnight oh shit hey, hows it going?
[0:38:36] <+HitchhikingThrough> Also I'd like to say
[0:38:47] <%Wool> what's going on
[0:38:50] <+HitchhikingThrough> Nero and V do technically have AI coded for them (used in the mission 7 fight)
[0:39:04] <DSD24> @Wool Someone mentioned technical difficulties
[0:39:09] <+HitchhikingThrough> So a final boss for Vergil BP TECHNICALLY isn't out of the question
[0:39:20] <lemon_lore> when is next Hxh ep
[0:39:20] <+HitchhikingThrough> but who knows if they'll actually do it.
[0:39:25] <+HitchhikingThrough> Probably they won't.
[0:39:32] <%Wool> did they do Black Christmas today?
[0:39:34] <%Josef_Stryker> I wonder if they'll just make Vergil the final boss for Vergil
[0:39:35] <KaironFortressKnight> none for Dante though right?
[0:39:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:40] <%Josef_Stryker> Or if he'll fight Dante and Nero
[0:39:47] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Wool Reggie is having controller problems
[0:40:01] <@Menitta> I would like a Vergil mirror match
[0:40:08] <%Irridium> that LOTGH shot LUL
[0:40:12] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Josef_Stryker like I said, it's not impossible for it to be dante or nero, but it will probably just be vergil
[0:40:16] <%Solidnick18> vergil vs V SeriousSloth
[0:40:31] <%Irridium> I want to get DDT'd by Nero is that too much to ask
[0:40:36] <KaironFortressKnight> I love how the Vergil CD that comes with the sss edition has beowulfs theme. odd, but cool.
[0:40:45] <+HitchhikingThrough> Unfortunate, as being able to fight Dante as Vergil will mean potentially Nero vs Dante and Dante vs Dante fights on PC
[0:41:24] <$infinite_rotation> I really hope vergil gets other weapons besides yamato
[0:41:38] <$infinite_rotation> Just Give me beowulf
[0:41:50] <%Solidnick18> hope he gets urizen
[0:41:50] <%Irridium> give him Nevan. Fuck it.
[0:42:01] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Irridium nah give Trish Nevan
[0:42:08] <KaironFortressKnight> vergil mode will at least give less bugs for wanting to play the whole game via only Dante or only Nero via mods
[0:42:09] <+HitchhikingThrough> also give Lady Pandora
[0:42:21] <Chaos_Switch> hyped
[0:42:23] <$infinite_rotation> Veril with nevan is somthing that feels paradoxical.
[0:42:33] <%RyTYoung> I think Vergil will have more than one weapon
[0:42:37] <$infinite_rotation> I can just imagine vergil holding it and thinking. “What is this shit”
[0:42:54] <+HitchhikingThrough> Also lightning has never been Vergil's thing
[0:42:56] <%Josef_Stryker> He's probably get a fancy violin or some shit
[0:43:00] <KaironFortressKnight> I want full weeb Vergil with a bow and a naginata
[0:43:11] <%Irridium> @HitchhikingThrough you're right but we need a Trish first. She was honestly my favorite of the 4SE characters. Real fun to play.
[0:43:29] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Irridium SAME. She's so fun and it's a pity people don't talk about here gameplay more
[0:43:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> *her gameplay
[0:43:37] <DSD24> I liked playing Lady more than Trish
[0:43:52] <$infinite_rotation> Still havent tried them in 4
[0:43:52] <@Menitta> I thought Trish was just too basic
[0:44:02] <$infinite_rotation> I should but ive just been up to other stuff
[0:44:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> Tossing out Sparda as a round trip then getting a punch moveset is such a nice way to call back to DMC1's gameplay
[0:44:18] <@Menitta> Like compared to Lady and Vergil, hell even Nero in 4SE, Trish is the most simple
[0:44:32] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Menitta simple doesn't mean not fun
[0:44:33] <@Menitta> Actually not nero
[0:44:47] <@Menitta> She's fun but after a while, I just went back to Vergil
[0:44:49] <+Scevda> Someone really quick what type of gamw os bloody roar?
[0:44:50] <KaironFortressKnight> Trish should come back with Alastor, Nevan and her own version of Cavaliere for maximum zappiness
[0:44:54] <%Irridium> she had a *real* nice feeling dive-kick
[0:44:56] <huskarl_zap> slow core hottopic music
[0:44:57] <DSD24> @Scevda 3D fighter
[0:45:13] <%Irridium> which left electricity that stun-locked enemies
[0:45:17] <DSD24> @Scevda You have human and beast forms that you can activate in the fight
[0:45:21] <+Scevda> Ya alright. Now to see who will be present.
[0:45:27] <+HitchhikingThrough> Not to mention V-divider
[0:45:34] <+HitchhikingThrough> AKA "Round trip but it's a snatch"
[0:45:57] <JetpackMcQuack> woolieMINHMAX
[0:46:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> also all her combos were cool. Maximum Overdrive is hype as fuck, and her Dance Macabre is way cooler than dante's
[0:46:09] <+cubbywolf> Keirchies :( F
[0:46:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> because it turns into Kick 13 half way through
[0:46:17] <CarlTheBlind> Silver bullet has to be the sickest song from 5
[0:46:37] <+HitchhikingThrough> Being woolie is suffering :(
[0:46:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:44] <optosi> uh oh jam alert
[0:46:46] <%Irridium> it's also just real fun to do that whirlwind kick in the middle of like 40 enemies in LDK mode
[0:46:46] <@Menitta> one day I'll play SOTN
[0:46:47] <KaironFortressKnight> PLAY BURY THE LIGHT COWARD
[0:47:15] <KaironFortressKnight> actually after this. this is good too.
[0:47:16] <DSD24> I know Woolie talked a bit about Nioh 2 but they added gauntlets that have a massive charge up punch that's kinda like Galatica Phantom
[0:47:16] <+cubbywolf> woolie the teppen fighter
[0:47:19] <+HitchhikingThrough> OH SHIT
[0:47:22] <+HitchhikingThrough> THE CALL OUT
[0:47:22] <@Menitta> YEYEYE
[0:47:25] <+HitchhikingThrough> @KaironFortressKnight GET FUCKED

[0:50:09] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:50:21] <+Amaideus> Remember when the popular thought was that Vergil wasn't trying to be cool?
[0:50:21] <KaironFortressKnight> yeyeyeye I need that dlc in my veins now plz
[0:50:31] <%Solidnick18> that good djent Kreygasm
[0:50:38] <+Amaideus> Because boy does this song disprove that and I love him being a goofy dumbass just like Dante

[0:51:08] <point4effort> its coming to pc
[0:51:10] <+JustToWatch> A phoenix's ash in dark divine so perfectly provokes a very specific type of person
[0:51:12] <DSD24> @cubbywolf Cause capcom are idiots
[0:51:16] <+HitchhikingThrough> One day people will accept that Sonic and Shadow are just Dante and Vergil's sonic OC's
[0:51:16] <+cubbywolf> is it?
[0:51:23] <@Menitta> vergil is coming to pc
[0:51:25] <@Solidus_113> you get Vergil and nothing else
[0:51:29] <%Irridium> Vergil's coming to PC, just not any of the other SE upgrades
[0:51:30] <@Menitta> not the performance stuff
[0:51:33] <@Solidus_113> no Turbo, no LDK, no ray tracing
[0:51:44] <fernandapsdois> is bloody roar over?
[0:51:44] <+HitchhikingThrough> Turbo is a mod for PC
[0:51:44] <+cubbywolf> oh

[0:52:58] <+HitchhikingThrough> can we ban moobot for being unmotivated
[0:53:07] <+cubbywolf> once japan gets that gundam moving will they work on beam technology?]
[0:53:13] <+cubbywolf> someone on youtube made a lightsaber almost
[0:53:18] <+cubbywolf> soon
[0:53:19] <@Solidus_113> we already have beam tech
[0:53:30] <@Solidus_113> just not on a large scale
[0:53:32] <+HitchhikingThrough> Now important question: Does the music woolie queued up have the Devils never cry bit-YES
[0:53:33] <+jackl314> PokCroagunk
[0:53:37] <+whatevsman16> Just in time for the gundam to be built
[0:53:52] <+HitchhikingThrough> I don't care if this is unintentional it's such a fucking parallel to Devils Never Cry
[0:53:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1315888762120011783?s=19
[0:53:56] <KaironFortressKnight> @hitchhikingthrough he better
[0:54:01] <+cubbywolf> we going elevator into space or just space colonies?
[0:54:09] <huskarl_zap> Woolos wat?
[0:54:19] <%RyTYoung> it's the best part of the song
[0:54:21] <+whatevsman16> I wanna say I hope for elevator, but I never finished 00
[0:54:32] <%CrimsonCore90> Drop a colony on earth 2020
[0:54:33] <KaironFortressKnight> I fucking love 00
[0:54:39] <KaironFortressKnight> Exia is bae
[0:54:42] <+HitchhikingThrough> Reminds me of the mix of Devils Never Cry and Never Surrender
[0:54:43] <%Solidnick18> Heal or destrooooooy
[0:54:50] <+cubbywolf> i Like how in 00 the places without elivators are shitholes, just like it would be in reality
[0:54:53] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:54:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the thing i dont get about space elevator is that it seems like a huge risk
[0:55:03] <+HitchhikingThrough> I would sing along but moobot is a dick so fuck it
[0:55:16] <+Scevda> Im still waiting on that game that brings woolie and pat and the community together to all play together.
[0:55:16] <%Solidnick18> BURY THE LIGHT DEEEP WITHIIIIINNNNNNN
[0:55:18] <+cubbywolf> well building a colony in space is a pretty big risk too
[0:55:21] <@Solidus_113> space elevators are so impractical
[0:55:26] <+HitchhikingThrough> @cobalt_phoenix_ yeah but the reduction in expense for space travel is a huge plus
[0:55:32] <%RyTYoung> Moobot strikes at random times, it sucks
[0:55:32] <angry_dragon0> MOTIVATED!
[0:55:37] <+HitchhikingThrough> 90% of the pain of getting something into space is breaking atmo
[0:55:41] <+Amaideus> What about all the random crap we have up there?
[0:55:42] <+b_aleph> Damn, those are some stubborn triggers...
[0:55:43] <KaironFortressKnight> Mmmm there's that GOOD SHIT
[0:55:45] <%Solidnick18> !motivated
[0:55:45] <@Moobot> 1779 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:55:46] <+Amaideus> Won't that get in the way?
[0:55:52] <point4effort> We need space yo yos
[0:55:55] <%RyTYoung> Casey Edwards is a leg end
[0:56:02] <+whatevsman16> @kaironfortressknight i still gotta finish it. It’s been so long, I may end up starting over again
[0:56:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hitchhikingthrough but wouldnt some stray debris fuck up the elevator and have it collapse?
[0:56:12] <+Scevda> Lets skip right to TP tech.
[0:56:14] <+HitchhikingThrough> @Amaideus eh? Kinda? Not really. It can be a problem but for the most part space is really big and we aren't that cluttered up there yet
[0:56:19] <+b_aleph> We talkin about Jakob elevator?
[0:56:25] <+HitchhikingThrough> I mean, ISS has been in orbit for however long and it's doing fine
[0:56:38] <huskarl_zap> So much vomit
[0:56:38] <point4effort> Idealy youd have the space elevator on the boat so you can move it around in the ocean
[0:56:40] <+cubbywolf> yo guys watch Golden Kamuy anime, it's a good show for mature folk
[0:56:41] <+Amaideus> I remember there being a kurzgesagt video about there being a ton of debris outside the atmosphere
[0:56:42] <+Scevda> ISS gets hit at times.
[0:56:47] <%CrimsonCore90> Debris > big sky little debris
[0:56:52] <+cubbywolf> ISS has almost blown up a few times
[0:56:55] <%Irridium> just get those laser like in that one armored core game. problem solved
[0:56:57] <KaironFortressKnight> this is the most Woolie chat ever. let's talk space, robots and vergil.
[0:57:08] <KaironFortressKnight> YEYEYEYE
[0:57:13] <+whatevsman16> @cubbywolf already on board that train. It’s a good train
[0:57:14] <%afronooch> YEYEYEYEYE

[0:57:52] <+HitchhikingThrough> People have apparently told me my PVP mod feels like anarchy reigns?
[0:57:54] <@Solidus_113> it's one of the last two Platinum games dead and forgotten
[0:57:57] <KaironFortressKnight> God id kill for Anarchy Reigns on PC
[0:58:04] <%RyTYoung> I need more Mob in my life
[0:58:04] <TrashLeviathan> speaking of punch/kick girls thoughts on giovanna in GGS
[0:58:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> I've never played anarchy reigns though, so take it with a grain of salt
[0:58:16] <point4effort> Giovanna has a dog so best character
[0:58:17] <the38bandit> i gotta finish mob 2nd season
[0:58:21] <+cubbywolf> poor platinum, their games are like fireworks, flashy and great and then everyone moves on before its even done
[0:58:24] <+HitchhikingThrough> We love dogs with an assist
[0:58:26] <%Solidnick18> play my asss oofff
[0:58:28] <@Solidus_113> AR is basically a character action brawler, it's great
[0:58:30] <%RyTYoung> @the38bandit it's pretty good
[0:58:44] <stardustcrusad3r> tony soprano with needler
[0:58:47] <+Scevda> Counting

[0:59:05] <+HitchhikingThrough> uhoh
[0:59:05] <%Irridium> It's kind of why I don't really play brawlers anymore. Like, I know it's not fair to compare Anime Brawler #17 to Anarchy Reigns but... man

[0:59:36] <Ramasama13> *lap
[0:59:41] <+HitchhikingThrough> Oh reggie has the stick huh
[0:59:42] <+b_aleph> FINALLY! The Rock has come back to Bloody Roar City!
[0:59:43] <DSD24> Yayyyyy
[0:59:44] <%CrimsonCore90> The better you play?
[0:59:46] <+Scevda> Thats how frustration works.
[0:59:50] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:59:51] <+HitchhikingThrough> Oh reggie has the stick :(
[0:59:57] <GlaceonYo> BWOODY WOAR
[0:59:57] <+HitchhikingThrough> Feels bad man
[0:59:59] <DSD24> Aww yeah those bloody roar noises
[1:00:04] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[1:00:04] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 13 minutes
[1:00:20] <TrashLeviathan> beastorize off?
[1:00:37] <%TrueUnderDawg> TrueUnderDawg subscribed at Tier 3.
[1:00:45] <Sannidor> BR2 is such a superior prequel to BR3 it's hilarious MercyWing1 Squid3 MercyWing2
[1:00:49] <+cubbywolf> maybe thats just the animation?
[1:00:50] <%TrueUnderDawg> Best Bloody Roar Game!!
[1:00:55] <Applecannon63> Beastorizer>Bloody Roar
[1:00:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:00:58] <+HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus are you sure it's not something with that character?
[1:01:04] <357Sneak> HyperTiger lytALRIGHT
[1:01:04] <%thatsocrunchy> Nice we’re back in it boiiis
[1:01:06] <%Irridium> is it because he's in beast mode?
[1:01:08] <Applecannon63> -for best name title
[1:01:11] <+cubbywolf> GIMME THE STICK woolie 2020
[1:01:17] <huskarl_zap> Kippa psaDogchamp
[1:01:22] <GeltonZ> It's arguable, every Bloody Roar except 4 has their strengths and weaknesses.
[1:01:51] <+Amaideus> I still dunno the difference gameplay wise between PF/Extreme and 3 other than the new characters
[1:02:01] <+whatevsman16> New Bloody Roar when?
[1:02:09] <+jetjagger222> never. thanks konami.
[1:02:10] <DSD24> Bloody Roar 4 is terrible
[1:02:17] <+b_aleph> @whatevsman16 when Konami bankrupts
[1:02:23] <Applecannon63> when someone owns the rights to bloodyroaor than konami
[1:02:25] <KaironFortressKnight> @whatevsman16 probably never and it hurts
[1:02:27] <GeltonZ> @Amaideus They added in QCF+Block command throws and a few other moves and they made some questionable tweaks to hyper beast among other things.
[1:03:01] <+Amaideus> Green sparks is counter, that yellow flash is a guardbreaker IIRC
[1:03:12] <+Amaideus> Thanks @GeltonZ
[1:03:30] <DSD24> Stun the Insect was so cool in this game
[1:03:38] <+jetjagger222> stun the insect is cool, period
[1:03:47] <+Dr_DangerPhD> In BR2 the guard escape is a sidestep as well
[1:03:48] <GeltonZ> @Amaideus No problem. PF literally started as a port and then Eighting got carried away. Just think of it as Super Bloody Roar 3, different but similar.
[1:03:50] <%TrueUnderDawg> @DSD24 Stun was the BEST
[1:03:55] <+odd_slater> Bloody Roar is one of many games on the list that I want some indie team to make in my favorite genre of "fuck you we'll do it ourselves I guess..."
[1:04:04] <DSD24> My brother mained Xion like a asshole in this game
[1:04:18] <Hoarseplay> @GeltonZ Extreme/Primal Fury is it's own game.
[1:04:18] <+Amaideus> I always heard 3 was best but PF had the most characters so it's the one we played
[1:04:43] <DSD24> I love this stages music
[1:04:51] <ggbhtg> You get an X-Factor Beast Mode with all 4 buttons
[1:04:52] <GeltonZ> @odd_slater The thing is, devs are still in business and making fighters, they just don't have the Bloody Roar license.
[1:04:59] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay Ah glad you're here
[1:05:00] <Hoarseplay> @Amaideus Depends on where you live. Different regions prefer BR2/BR3/BREX.
[1:05:04] <TrashLeviathan> SourPls
[1:05:06] <DSD24> Yeah you do Woolie
[1:05:14] <Hoarseplay> @WoolieVersus There are wall breaks.
[1:05:14] <+odd_slater> Yeah 8ing recently did a Zoids game
[1:05:16] <DSD24> You can get blasted off the stage
[1:05:29] <ggbhtg> You get an X-Factor Beast Mode with all 4 buttons if your Beast Gauge is Maxed out to yellow @WoolieVersus
[1:05:42] <%Solidnick18> wahhhaaa
[1:05:45] <%TrueUnderDawg> Not my girl Alice D:
[1:05:50] <Hoarseplay> You're thinking of Primal Fury, but wall breaks are in this game as well.
[1:05:56] <+HitchhikingThrough> Tabbed out for a sec, is a good time being had now?
[1:05:57] <Dave_VD> You it’s the game from fisticuffs with big dumb animal transformations
[1:05:58] <+jetjagger222> its different because he has glasses
[1:06:03] <Dave_VD> Hell yes
[1:06:15] <%Solidnick18> oh that was cool
[1:06:16] <+Amaideus> Roll em into a ball baybee
[1:06:21] <ggbhtg> green aura is the attacks with guarding startup @WoolieVersus
[1:06:37] <ggbhtg> You get an X-Factor Beast Mode with all 4 buttons if your Beast Gauge is Maxed out to yellow @WoolieVersus
[1:06:39] <%Malik1002> JESUS CHRIST
[1:06:43] <Hoarseplay> You have to keep damaging the same wall, it's like Real Bout.
[1:06:54] <ggbhtg> press all 4 buttons I mean
[1:06:55] <%Malik1002> alice got punched in the face
[1:07:01] <+Amaideus> The custom mode probably has a "weak walls" option
[1:07:08] <%doombawkzvs> You must defeat Shen Long if you want any chance to beat me
[1:07:11] <+Amaideus> It's a Ken/Ryu situation
[1:07:17] <GeltonZ> Shenlong is REALLY good. I constantly see him show up in tournaments.
[1:07:28] <deafmelone> Shenlong is slower and stronger i think
[1:07:28] <%Xero_J> Give it a bit
[1:07:40] <%Xero_J> There we go
[1:07:41] <%Solidnick18> go kitty
[1:07:48] <+whatevsman16> “I wIlI KiLl yOu”

[1:08:12] <+Amaideus> God, early 2k VA
[1:08:16] <%Solidnick18> go awayyyyy
[1:08:38] <+Amaideus> I always loved the sound tearing on transform
[1:09:18] <delerim001> man I love shenlong, he is so cool
[1:09:23] <%doombawkzvs> Go away
[1:09:32] <black_pariah> i liked shenlong better when he wasnt super edgy in the way only a shonen rival can be
[1:09:32] <KaironFortressKnight> mreow
[1:09:52] <BoneBagMel> spam down and kick during shenlongs kick combo for a super sick special attack
[1:10:00] <%Solidnick18> sick scam
[1:10:05] <ggbhtg> Pressing all 4 buttons activates Hyper Beast Mode. An X-Factor like state @WoolieVersus
[1:10:07] <+Amaideus> Pilot it into walls for more damage
[1:10:14] <IncredibleMeh> oh, Beast Drive is just DT for furries
[1:10:18] <%Solidnick18> STUN
[1:10:18] <+jetjagger222> he already looks like a lizard in human form
[1:10:25] <KaironFortressKnight> YEAH STUN
[1:10:33] <big_jay_rock> Stun is so sick
[1:10:35] <%Solidnick18> freezing space
[1:10:35] <DSD24> Aww yeah Stun!
[1:10:36] <Sarcastastic> picking my two favs
[1:10:36] <+Amaideus> Stun's my favorite fighting game character
[1:10:37] <ggbhtg> dang it, I keep erasing bits of into
[1:10:40] <Sarcastastic> you guys are heroes
[1:10:45] <Hoarseplay> You can guard cancel all QCB/QCF special moves with the block button.
[1:11:01] <%Solidnick18> YOOOO
[1:11:03] <KaironFortressKnight> YEAH
[1:11:04] <MikeStrider> Stun and Busuzima are rivals

[1:13:29] <+cubbywolf> down to the wire
[1:13:33] <+Amaideus> Crawlies is also strong
[1:13:36] <+whatevsman16> Crawlies works better
[1:13:37] <ggbhtg> When Beast Gauge is below blue / LV1, Beast button does a slight attack, that recharges meter up to that point. @WoolieVersus
[1:13:42] <MikeStrider> Stun was a former scientist for the big bad company that was experimented on once he found out they were evil. And Busuzima was the one in the company to turn on him.
[1:13:42] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:13:44] <DSD24> Look at this boy
[1:13:47] <%SableS139a> C l u t c h
[1:13:49] <%Livelinne> Buggies
[1:13:50] <Sarcastastic> chities sounds like a slur in some fantasy or sci fi
[1:13:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this looks so cool
[1:13:53] <ggbhtg> Pressing all 4 buttons activates Hyper Beast Mode. An X-Factor like state that lasts 12 seconds and burns out your Beast Gauge afterwards. @WoolieVersus
[1:13:58] <ggbhtg> at max meter
[1:14:03] <DSD24> Shina is great
[1:14:03] <ggbhtg> Lv 2 / Yellow
[1:14:03] <Hoarseplay> @WoolieVersus You can guard cancel all QCB/QCF special moves with the block button.
[1:14:04] <+b_aleph> LETS GO REGGIE

[1:18:13] <GeltonZ> @Meltgar The one from the first game melted. Otherwise yeah this is just an alt costume.
[1:18:24] <Meltgar> @DSD24 Oh isee! @GeltonZ
[1:18:31] <+Amaideus> I think they're missing Robot mole and boss character
[1:18:34] <+Nemesisnick33> im guessing woolie is the one playing the boss character?
[1:18:40] <+b_aleph> savage
[1:18:42] <Maleicus> the unborn
[1:18:44] <KnivesEve> I remember this game!
[1:18:48] <black_pariah> i feel a ninja character should look like a ninja, just saying
[1:18:49] <DSD24> @Nemesisnick33 There's a boss character and he isn't playing her
[1:18:53] <%Solidnick18> it's an unbirth
[1:18:56] <+b_aleph> It's an adult abortion
[1:18:58] <+solidv2> he is the ultimate life form
[1:19:01] <DSD24> @black_pariah That's the first costume my dood
[1:19:05] <GeltonZ> The Unborn is a creature SO POWERFUL that Gaia would not allow it to be born.
[1:19:14] <%Shardlab> It's probably just some prehistoric arhropod
[1:19:16] <+Nemesisnick33> xion the unknown is also a boss/ secret character DSD24
[1:19:17] <%Xero_J> @black_pariah His main outfit is a ninja costume
[1:19:22] <KaironFortressKnight> you know, its the bioarmor guyver, lives in the forest with bears and shit

[1:20:22] <%Irridium> a half breed
[1:20:22] <+j0hnnydonuts> it's kinda dumb how the sexified the bat lol
[1:20:26] <%Shardlab> Jenny: the gentleman's choice of BR fanservice
[1:20:27] <+b_aleph> @Solidnick18 totes
[1:20:29] <+Amaideus> "Stuned" is probably the word there
[1:20:30] <Maleicus> a human tuned into a beast
[1:20:34] <+j0hnnydonuts> iirc
[1:20:36] <+Amaideus> Stunted*
[1:20:39] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus She lost her ability to transform fully because she was experimented on. In the first game she was a Were-Demon.
[1:20:41] <+jetjagger222> GENOCIDE CUTTAH
[1:20:49] <black_pariah> she should be a cat, but cant transform all the way
[1:20:51] <delerim001> I dislike jenny beast form, she should be ugly as a bat
[1:20:57] <counterfeitgimmicks> hi woolie :)
[1:20:58] <+Amaideus> First game she was basically Uranus
[1:21:10] <%SableS139a> KUNG FU CATS
[1:21:10] <+jetjagger222> she's more girl than cat
[1:21:10] <Meltgar> LUL
[1:21:17] <GeltonZ> Jenny isn't really a zoanthrope, she's a vampire...possibly.
[1:21:18] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:21:25] <%RyTYoung> psaBlep
[1:21:26] <the38bandit> WereCat
[1:21:28] <+xblessedbullet> oddly enough I think they changed her to uriko the cat after this game
[1:21:31] <+j0hnnydonuts> yep that's what I remember lol
[1:21:31] <GeltonZ> They started calling Uriko a cat in 4 because Nagi was ALSO a half beast.
[1:21:33] <+Doc1790> She's a half & half
[1:21:33] <VioletRosefall> GIGGLE
[1:21:36] <%Solidnick18> but don't have cat babies
[1:21:36] <falconx9k> Speaking of not committing
[1:21:38] <+HitchhikingThrough> Oh wow I just looked at the stream that's furry as FUCK
[1:21:40] <+b_aleph> Jenny the lewd
[1:21:41] <Meltgar> GEEZUS she looks like devilman character
[1:21:42] <KaironFortressKnight> thats BARELY a bit
[1:21:43] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Almost!
[1:21:46] <KaironFortressKnight> bat
[1:21:48] <%Giothegame> Yea Uriko wasn't alwayus a cat girl
[1:21:51] <%Solidnick18> jenny is a tall lady
[1:21:56] <+Amaideus> It's amazing playing this series didn't make me into a furry or give me a monster girl fetish
[1:22:00] <+HitchhikingThrough> Fun looking animations though
[1:22:06] <+jetjagger222> @Amaideus not yet
[1:22:07] <black_pariah> she used to transform into true ogre
[1:22:09] <TrashLeviathan> jenny looks like that one nioh boss
[1:22:13] <$infinite_rotation> Say wht you will, but would rather her have a hideous bat face? Bats are ugly man.
[1:22:18] <Maleicus> yes

[1:22:34] <%pyrotherian> Go all the way or not at all
[1:22:34] <Dave_VD> Does this game have parries?
[1:22:34] <+Nemesisnick33> infinite_rotation some bats are kinda cute
[1:22:37] <falconx9k> She should be a big dumb bat
[1:22:41] <GeltonZ> @Dave_VD Yes
[1:22:43] <+Amaideus> That little dodge they sometimes do is the parry
[1:22:44] <+BurkeBigsby> Bloody Roar Extreme was my jam. Penguin representation.
[1:22:44] <%pyrotherian> Also yeah some bats are cute
[1:22:51] <+jetjagger222> some are hellbeasts, some are mice or dogs with wings
[1:22:56] <%pyrotherian> Fruit bats are adorable
[1:23:05] <delerim001> @infinite_rotation she could at least look like the other beast forms
[1:23:09] <%pyrotherian> Flying dogs with even bigger eyes
[1:23:11] <big_jay_rock> Uriko got them kicks
[1:23:12] <DSD24> Uriko is cute
[1:23:20] <Meltgar> When are we getting a character that transforms into a sports mascot instead of a hyper beast Kappa
[1:23:27] <%Solidnick18> she kinda has that dress hancock from one piece wears

[1:23:53] <+b_aleph> LETS GO WOOLIE
[1:23:55] <anuchallengertwitch> @delerim001 Maybe making her full furry cept for her face would be a good compromise?
[1:23:55] <GeltonZ> @Solidus_113 Wait...hold up...what if Elon Musk founds the Tylon Corporation?!
[1:23:56] <$infinite_rotation> Main character man
[1:23:58] <KaironFortressKnight> boxer wolf man

[1:26:01] <DSD24> There's two
[1:26:07] <GeltonZ> Two but good luck getting them.
[1:26:08] <Hoarseplay> @Giothegame Extreme/Primal Fury is a good bet.
[1:26:08] <+xblessedbullet> I wish they would go through all then characters supers
[1:26:09] <falconx9k> Uranus and Kohryu
[1:26:10] <Dementedpenguin> I miss my copy of Bloody Roar 1.... I let someone borrow it and.... yeah.
[1:26:14] <anuchallengertwitch> what kinda animal is an Unborn?
[1:26:14] <%pyrotherian> Bakuryu looks like Cloud but brunette
[1:26:15] <DSD24> Korhyu the Iron Mole and Uranus
[1:26:18] <%Shardlab> Oh yes... the Phoenix
[1:26:19] <+xblessedbullet> I think they'll like some of them
[1:26:21] <%Livelinne> Bun bun? shiaHug
[1:26:25] <%SableS139a> Reggie, Galactica Phantom is a perfectly fine move. There's no reason to be scared of it.
[1:26:27] <Hoarseplay> @WoolieVersus beat the game without a continue and you unlock both.
[1:26:30] <delerim001> @anuchallengertwitch ultimate life form
[1:26:35] <+Nemesisnick33> someone pick uranus already Kreygasm
[1:26:48] <Meltgar> @anuchallengertwitch Darkstalkers Fetus of God Kappa
[1:26:48] <GeltonZ> @Dementedpenguin Well it's on PSN for PSP, PS3, and Vita...or you know...we live in the future where PS1 is easy to run on PC. I feel ya'.
[1:26:54] <anuchallengertwitch> @delerim001 so a black Hedgehog?
[1:27:04] <+b_aleph> @Nemesisnick33 i don't think they have it unlocked
[1:27:08] <+Doc1790> An Unborn is just a cockroach. Because they are the scum of the Earth.
[1:27:10] <%Giothegame> @Hoarseplay It was definitely 2 or 3
[1:27:14] <%AsinPersuasion> so is beast change just an install?
[1:27:15] <Dementedpenguin> @GeltonZ I have neither of those systems
[1:27:20] <Dizzy_Pink> the real bloody roar starts now
[1:27:22] <delerim001> @anuchallengertwitch More or lest
[1:27:22] <venomryu> @WoolieVersus yes those bosses are shenlong and uranis
[1:27:25] <+Amaideus> It also gives you more moves
[1:27:35] <$RunningNGunning> Oh, he turns into Omega Shenron
[1:27:37] <Hammatime8> Damn that thing looks rad
[1:27:40] <+Nemesisnick33> then unlock it and pick it b_aleph
[1:27:47] <Hoarseplay> Is it ever explained why the Unborn is a mech?
[1:27:49] <DSD24> These supers are so good
[1:27:54] <anuchallengertwitch> @delerim001 looks like a sentai demon.
[1:28:09] <Dementedpenguin> @GeltonZ I more or less "leaped" over that generation of PS gaming LUL
[1:28:12] <damienlunas> Xion turns into a fucking laser demon and Bakuryu becomes a Mole? How is that fair?
[1:28:20] <+Amaideus> To be fair
[1:28:24] <+Amaideus> The mole is a ninja
[1:28:27] <%Solidnick18> KO
[1:28:29] <GeltonZ> @Dementedpenguin XD Understandable
[1:28:33] <Meltgar> So legally an orc would be a bloody roar character since it's a mix with a pig? Kappa
[1:28:35] <%Solidnick18> izuna drops Kreygasm
[1:28:36] <anuchallengertwitch> @damienlunas Izuna drops, that's how
[1:28:36] <Pyrenity> Ninja moles eh?

[1:31:14] <%Livelinne> shiaSmug
[1:31:15] <MikeStrider> @hoarseplay Xion’s transformation is basically a demon created by Gaia that has its own personality. “In the Bloody Roar mythology, The Unborn represents all the life forms that could not evolve through the natural selection and all the future life forms who will born through the evolution but are not existing yet.”

[1:32:04] <%Livelinne> Nice I-balance woolieMIRIN
[1:32:07] <Hoarseplay> @MikeStrider I understand the lore of Xion, I'm talking about from a character design standpoint.
[1:32:10] <+Doc1790> ITS THE SAME STAGE
[1:32:14] <%AsinPersuasion> @AsinPersuasion by that you mean the movesets are the exact same?
[1:32:14] <%jinking79> Woolie almost got the Bicycle Kick combo
[1:32:24] <misterurbanthelegend> Yo.
[1:32:40] <bdota3> Yugo looks sick as heel
[1:32:44] <bdota3> hell*
[1:32:57] <Jrocy247> Man I fucking WISH they would make another Bloody Roar game
[1:33:00] <KaironFortressKnight> @woolieversus Yugos profession is a boxer iirc
[1:33:07] <MikeStrider> @hoarseplay well if you’re just talking about design, I just immediately point to the Guyver series. It felt like the devs were fans of it.
[1:33:09] <%Giothegame> @AsinPersuasion Lore wise and they share some moves
[1:33:16] <Meltgar> @AsinPersuasion Clone in terms of the story, moveset, totally different
[1:33:17] <Dizzy_Pink> @Jrocy247 there is a netplay community that's pretty active
[1:33:23] <bdota3> @Jrocy247 We all do man
[1:33:30] <Hoarseplay> @AsinPersuasion Kinda. Long, Shenlong and Uriko have a similar gameplay mechanic, but different routes out of them.
[1:33:35] <Dizzy_Pink> mostly for BR extreme though
[1:33:36] <%doombawkzvs> Wolf fang fist?
[1:33:52] <DSD24> More Stun
[1:33:52] <%Giothegame> Yugo got a stance as well
[1:34:04] <Dizzy_Pink> @WoolieVersus you can jump cancel any special that launches into an air combo
[1:34:05] <bdota3> It looks so weird
[1:34:06] <Jrocy247> Yo Busuzima is fuck
[1:34:09] <Hammatime8> His face is so goofy
[1:34:14] <DSD24> I'm pretty sure Yugo has the Flicker stance
[1:34:15] <GeltonZ> Well yeah...he's a chameleon
[1:34:19] <SnoopuRu> i wanted to try this game but got turned away from the potential air teching on frame 1, anyone know if it's possible to prevent or punish air teching?
[1:34:20] <%Solidnick18> cause he's a chameleon
[1:34:20] <falconx9k> Busuzima is just a big weirdo
[1:34:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like... a chamaeleon?
[1:34:25] <Meltgar> LUL
[1:34:32] <edgeyberzerker> Now that's a power stance
[1:34:32] <%SableS139a> majinoWut
[1:34:33] <deafmelone> Busuzima is a creeper lol
[1:34:33] <%doombawkzvs> He looks like he's doing the Torture Dance from JJBA
[1:34:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> he look like a grappler baki character 💀
[1:34:35] <anuchallengertwitch> @GeltonZ exactly
[1:34:42] <bdota3> HES JUST CHAD
[1:34:45] <Jrocy247> THE BULLYING
[1:34:48] <anuchallengertwitch> Yo STun looks kinda sick
[1:34:49] <Meltgar> HEAD BUTTO
[1:34:51] <%AsinPersuasion> whats the electric dude from digimon doing here
[1:34:52] <+Willdog1993> Did I just teleport to like 10 min ago? They played this exact match.
[1:34:52] <big_jay_rock> Stuns profession is a pro wrestler
[1:34:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god that bug guy looks so cool
[1:34:54] <+Amaideus> Wait until they start using QC moves
[1:34:55] <YakumoYomi> I noticed that don't have Kohryu and Uranus unlocked
[1:34:56] <delerim001> stun look so good he is like a tank
[1:34:56] <%Solidnick18> reggie is baby
[1:34:57] <bdota3> BUSUZIMA IS JUST CHAD
[1:35:00] <%AsinPersuasion> kabuterimon?
[1:35:05] <KeiPrime> yeah someone mentioned guyver earlier, stun has some fuckin zoanoid lookin energy goin on there
[1:35:11] <Hammatime8> @bdota3 Holy shit HE TOTALLY IS
[1:35:18] <anuchallengertwitch> @cobalt_phoenix_ i Know. reminds me kinda of Carnage Kabuto

[1:35:41] <%LaloDeLaSoul> i can't believe Busuzema is fucking dead
[1:35:47] <+Amaideus> Deserved
[1:35:50] <ggbhtg> Green aura is guard frames into attack
[1:35:51] <DSD24> Alice is the Nurse
[1:35:56] <ggbhtg> Yellow is guard breaker
[1:35:57] <+Amaideus> Yellow flashes are guard breaks
[1:35:59] <Hammatime8> Does that lizard form usually take up so much screen space?
[1:36:00] <Jrocy247> Baku looks so different
[1:36:01] <%Solidnick18> more boxer for woolie
[1:36:03] <SnoopuRu> those flashes are the ones you have to block button against iirc
[1:36:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what's the headband guy?
[1:36:19] <Hoarseplay> @Hammatime8 beast forms are extra large.
[1:36:19] <Dizzy_Pink> @WoolieVersus you can end most strings with specials and then cancel the special into a grab
[1:36:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:36:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> Beetles and beetle-based designs are always Based. Heracross, Kamen Rider, that one dude form OPM, you name it. You can't deny
[1:36:36] <bdota3> @Dizzy_Pink yo thats sick actually
[1:36:41] <+Amaideus> Kabuterimons

[1:37:02] <Flowlethal> is this game that got people interested in animals?
[1:37:08] <%SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim Let's be real, beetle character designs are hard to fuck up. They're awesome-ass bugs.
[1:37:12] <bdota3> Wait so does beast transform work as a burst?
[1:37:14] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Metabee
[1:37:18] <+Amaideus> Yeah
[1:37:18] <Hoarseplay> Fun Fact: Yugo is voiced by Barry in this game. From RE1.
[1:37:20] <DSD24> @bdota3 Yes it does
[1:37:24] <delerim001> does this game have the nurse costume for alice?
[1:37:29] <bdota3> Bro this game is fucking sick
[1:37:33] <GeltonZ> @Flowlethal Nah that was more cartoons. Especially Rescue Rangers.
[1:37:34] <DSD24> @delerim001 I believe that's the third costume
[1:37:34] <+rednecked__crake> berryaGasm That bunny

[1:37:45] <Dizzy_Pink> @WoolieVersus you can also cancel your jump animation by pressing any movement other than an upward direction before you leave the ground, it's called unjump

[1:44:36] <Hoarseplay> @WoolieVersus It's ususally safer to restart the game between players.

[2:07:25] <yusefHD> well she is quick and Nimble when she needs to be
[2:07:27] <+cursedwithadhd> is this game called MMO Armor?
[2:07:39] <Dizzy_Pink> so the tier list for the game right now is S: xion alice yugo shenlong A: jenny gado fang long B: khoryu ganesha uriko C: stun bakuryu shina/marvel busuzima
[2:07:43] <yusefHD> Kappa
[2:07:50] <Dizzy_Pink> just fyi
[2:07:57] <bronzyisland> amazon has a new cloud gaming sevice like google stadia. where you pay 7 bucks a month like stadia. but theres a BIG difference. with stadia you gotta buy every individual game. but with luna every game is free!!! you can play any game you want for free. just 7 bucks a month and you have access to 72 games to start, theyll add more later.
[2:08:05] <%Axle13j> That was sick lol
[2:08:13] <bronzyisland> amazon luna is still in beta tho
[2:08:15] <deafmelone> stun has CHAIN THROWS
[2:08:18] <Dizzy_Pink> is this a copypasta or an ad?
[2:08:19] <GeltonZ> @Dizzy_Pink That's shocking and unexpected. Thought Uriko and Bakuryu would be higher.
[2:08:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> My boy shenlong in S gwdFlex gwdFlex gwdFlex
[2:08:20] <Zantetzuken> CoolStoryBob
[2:08:20] <bronzyisland> invite only
[2:08:28] <kurisu_moten> @dizzy_pink I kinda agree with your list
[2:08:29] <+TopTieramisu> bruh, did someone just comment an ad in chat
[2:08:36] <%ClericOfSparda> His head looks like a xenomorph
[2:08:40] <DSD24> Woolie should watch combo videos after this
[2:08:41] <+jetjagger222> lol that did read like big shill time

[2:09:22] <yusefHD> shoutouts to Twitch Prime
[2:09:23] <%ClericOfSparda> I used to really like Alice
[2:09:26] <point4effort> Jeff Bezos can't afford a console LUL
[2:09:32] <Dizzy_Pink> @kurisu_moten uriko and bakuryu are tricky to deal with, but they rely a lot on confirms and mixups and they don't have very good starters or strings, which are very important in this game
[2:09:34] <bronzyisland> 7 bucks for 72 games=near free
[2:09:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Raid shadow legends is a brand new ambitious RPG that is taking the mobile landscape by storm and over 10 million players have already downloaded the game. The graphics are so good that it looks like it's a console game. It has strategic gameplay, massive boss fights, an auto attack feature, an amazing storyline and over 400 champions to choose from. My favourite is this fucker because the script says I have to say which one is my favourite or I won't get the money.
[2:09:37] <DSD24> Alice got a way lamer redesign in the other games
[2:09:38] <+jetjagger222> oh man dat voice acting
[2:09:48] <heartlesshealer> who cares about amazon luna? We got Bloody Roar

[2:11:30] <point4effort> Mods not allowed to go to the bathroom like Amazon employees
[2:11:38] <heartlesshealer> either way "....."
[2:11:46] <Dizzy_Pink> @kurisu_moten the tier list i pulled from was designed for extreme on gamecube, but i assume it carries over for a lot of installments

[2:14:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> @point4effort now this i havent considered

[2:15:12] <heartlesshealer> oh well
[2:15:13] <Hoarseplay> Counter hits give you a massive damage buff.
[2:15:19] <Dizzy_Pink> @WoolieVersus i think supers in this game scale damage with remaining gauge
[2:15:24] <deafmelone> Supers dp more damage depending on how much meter you have
[2:15:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> Listen fam I just like to see the cool animal people do cool animal fight moves. I'm just easy to please
[2:15:30] <+Amaideus> That's how they work in PF at least
[2:15:37] <kurisu_moten> Someone pick shina! That’s my main chick
[2:15:38] <Hoarseplay> Did anyone tell them about Hyper Beast?
[2:15:42] <GeltonZ> Yeah I'm shocked to hear one game in this series DOESN'T have supers that do 50% damage!
[2:15:45] <Dizzy_Pink> TELL THEM ABOUT HYPER BEAST
[2:15:48] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay They tried.
[2:16:00] <Dizzy_Pink> PRESS R1

[2:38:51] <LoneFonte> just do Kirby week
[2:38:53] <+denizen_conspirator> kirby or feed
[2:38:53] <Meltgar> I arrived to this stream for WOOLIE VS, not RUNNING AWAY from kirby fighters 2 FULL LP Kappa
[2:38:58] <Saltmeisterr> are they just starting this game?
[2:38:59] <Dizzy_Pink> is this a smash bros?
[2:39:06] <+xmetalicdemonx> I would like a kirby playthrough sometime in the future.
[2:39:14] <ggbhtg> Woolie doesn't love is pink puff son enough to full LP, Feels Badminton Kappa
[2:39:16] <kulmoth> surprise full LP
[2:39:19] <Dizzy_Pink> is this smash 6?
[2:39:33] <RaidenRising> where is steve
[2:39:45] <%Solidnick18> Get into kirby
[2:39:53] <$razielhex> every smash update is a Kirby expansion, soon all will be Kirby. When Smash Ultimate destroyed the universe, there was only Kirby. So Kirby remade the universe in his image
[2:39:54] <Saltmeisterr> this game has button rebinging right?
[2:40:00] <+blewbeary> pipe it up
[2:40:02] <+blewbeary> yeyeye
[2:40:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> I was replaying super star ultra yesterday and I got upset when I realised that version of fighter kirby doesn't have a hadouken gwdSta
[2:40:30] <heartlesshealer> Waddle Dee only has basic Superstar inputs? Damn
[2:40:34] <ggbhtg> no Friendly Fire, this Double Bracket is BS
[2:40:40] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus you should check out the mizuumi wiki for all the tech
[2:40:44] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:40:45] <MattDemers> @Saltmeisterr The Switch has pretty in-depth button remapping
[2:40:52] <Meltgar> EZ Stage 1 LUL
[2:40:54] <%Wool> Finish the first tower run for unlocks!!
[2:40:59] <SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE
[2:40:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:41:01] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[2:41:03] <%SableS139a> Yeah, going back to any other Kirby game with a full command list per ability is suffering after playing RTDL and beyond. Especially Parasol, Sword, and Ninja since they feel weak as shit in Super Star.
[2:41:05] <heartlesshealer> backdrop fuck yeah
[2:41:06] <ggbhtg> WE DO IT
[2:41:07] <%Mr_Strut> Game complete
[2:41:10] <@Menitta> yeah thats the first unlock lol
[2:41:10] <Saltmeisterr> @MattDemers ok but does the game have button remapping
[2:41:10] <ggbhtg> LP DEFEATED
[2:41:10] <%Solidnick18> WE DO IT
[2:41:16] <Meltgar> STREAM OVER Kappa
[2:41:16] <%Solidnick18> Lp defeated
[2:41:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> LP FINISHED WE DO IT
[2:41:17] <ggbhtg> LP Compreeeete
[2:41:18] <MattDemers> @Saltmeisterr Not sure if it's per-game or not.
[2:41:33] <%Wool> I've labbed a Wrestler ToD for a bit
[2:41:43] <Mibeador> wrestler ToDs are fake
[2:41:46] <SomersaultJustice> the game has some TECH
[2:41:46] <%Mr_Strut> I'm pretty sure it's the law
[2:41:48] <ggbhtg> the hustlin and bustlin Kirby Fighters Community
[2:41:52] <RaidenRising> you are soul linked to kirby
[2:41:53] <@Menitta> Wrestler Kirby is raw
[2:42:03] <SomersaultJustice> it's not
[2:42:05] <%Solidnick18> the newest boi
[2:42:07] <@Menitta> It is not the same at all
[2:42:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> Alright guys. give it to me straight. is there a tier list and how high and Whip Kirby on said list?
[2:42:12] <@Menitta> its BETTER
[2:42:15] <SomersaultJustice> we must go... beyond
[2:42:17] <ggbhtg> give me Izuna Drop, or give me death
[2:42:18] <+Taisuru> But what does wrestler kirby do in gunslinger?
[2:42:20] <+Mordexai0> IT'S BETTER
[2:42:21] <heartlesshealer> better
[2:42:24] <powerprotoman> choose the X star to turn off ai
[2:42:25] <LoneFonte> Suplex was so good
[2:42:26] <%Mr_Strut> Isn't beetle the suplex power?
[2:42:28] <Saltmeisterr> i know the switch has button remapping but its system wide
[2:42:29] <Mibeador> there's no great tier lists, cause a lot of people haven't played some characters
[2:42:31] <SomersaultJustice> do the ric flair chops
[2:42:34] <%SableS139a> Wrestler carries some stuff from Suplex & Fighter, but takes the concepts in an entirely different direction, and it's glorious.
[2:42:34] <ggbhtg> Give me Izuna Drop, or give me death
[2:42:38] <Mibeador> but I can send a general tier list
[2:42:43] <$RunningNGunning> The next 20 smash announcements are just going to be different variations of Kirby
[2:42:47] <Meltgar> Reggie VS Woolie
[2:42:47] <powerprotoman> this is what fi suplex was good
[2:42:52] <%SableS139a> @ggbhtg Izuna Drop is Ninja exclusive. Sorry fam
[2:42:55] <@Menitta> I still like Fighter because you can do Hadouken motions
[2:42:58] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:42:59] <Saltmeisterr> @Mr_Strut beetle is grab and move
[2:43:02] <$laphyrion> Is this a downloadable title, or is this DLC for the Kirby game on the Switch?
[2:43:03] <MattDemers> Kenta Kobashi Kreygasm
[2:43:05] <SomersaultJustice> LARIAT
[2:43:06] <%Mr_Strut> Suplex purely for stlye. That's why it's so good.
[2:43:07] <ggbhtg> LARIATOOOOO

[2:43:31] <+JustToWatch> woolie there were 4 more pages of moves
[2:43:35] <%Mr_Strut> The grab is just the dash move

[2:44:12] <%Mr_Strut> This is suplex now
[2:44:13] <Jaller101514> yes
[2:44:13] <ggbhtg> morrrrre
[2:44:13] <Saltmeisterr> Spear is my favorite copy ability along side archer

[2:44:49] <%Wool> Woolie there's an actual Training Mode

[2:45:05] <%Solidnick18> what
[2:45:06] <%SableS139a> The Training Stage is just the tutorial level from Kirby 64, and I brought tears to my eyes.

[2:45:48] <%SableS139a> Wrestler has both a command grab for the dash attack and a leaping drill kick if you press Jump & Attack at the same time while dashing.
[2:45:58] <@Menitta> Holy shit I didnt realize they were Air Ride boxews
[2:46:02] <ggbhtg> I refuse to believe that Woolie didn't notice the 5 whole pages of moves
[2:46:05] <heartlesshealer> page one of FIVE
[2:46:06] <ggbhtg> no way
[2:46:20] <ggbhtg> see?

[2:49:59] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus there's only 3 stages in the game with walls and they're the 3 worst stages in the game lol
[2:50:06] <ggbhtg> LIFT STANCE
[2:50:17] <+cubbywolf> In my days, kirby just ate and got a move
[2:50:18] <%Solidnick18> you get the list

[2:51:23] <RaidenRising> someone call paul heyman
[2:51:31] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder if beetle is any good here
[2:51:32] <+KgKid51> HYPER BOMB
[2:51:47] <+cubbywolf> woolie, you've learned too many moves. Your move memory space is discarding information even as you learn it.
[2:51:47] <Mibeador> in this game there's some characters with 20 moves, there's others with literally 3 moves
[2:51:55] <ggbhtg> Lucharaaaaan
[2:51:58] <DerpioParty> Luchaaaaaaa Mucha Luchaaaa

[2:52:14] <SomersaultJustice> launch and then air grab
[2:52:17] <ggbhtg> BACK BREAAAAAAKaaaaa
[2:52:19] <heartlesshealer> uppercut into flying grab
[2:52:25] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus that's a separate move
[2:52:26] <+cubbywolf> too many moves to remember
[2:52:32] <@Menitta> Flying grab isnt a follow up ]
[2:52:38] <@Menitta> YEYEYE
[2:52:45] <LoneFonte> OH WOW
[2:52:45] <%Solidnick18> tooo sick

[2:52:55] <%trustycoyote> how can a little pink puffball be so hype
[2:53:08] <Potatoidea> Nice!
[2:53:11] <Mibeador> that can be air dodged or DIed IIRC
[2:53:12] <ggbhtg> @trustycoyote what century are you from, old man?
[2:53:26] <ggbhtg> ATOMIKKU
[2:53:28] <ggbhtg> BUSTAAA
[2:53:28] <powerprotoman> after you lift do back and then forward for a sick as fuck attack
[2:53:31] <LoneFonte> YOOOOOOOOOO

[2:53:35] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[2:53:37] <+violet_city> YOOOOO
[2:53:45] <kulmoth> this has no right to be this good
[2:53:46] <GeltonZ> This is awesome! #KirbyForSmash Footballfinger
[2:53:54] <%trustycoyote> @ggbhtg Found out about internet like a week ago. Tech is getting crazy, man
[2:54:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @rarvikar
[2:54:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> ¡LUCHARAAAAAAAAAAN! A DOS DE TRES CAÌDAS
[2:54:17] <ggbhtg> where are da combos, chat
[2:54:19] <LoneFonte> after Fighter Pass 2 we get the new Kirby Pass 1
[2:54:21] <groovykrovvy> kirby makes his own smash, with kirby, and kirby!
[2:54:24] <+rarvikar> Oh my god this is the cutest game I have ever seen
[2:54:29] <Mibeador> a lot of combos are fake in this game @ggbhtg
[2:54:39] <Mibeador> combos are very tight
[2:55:01] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> Are ya winning son?
[2:55:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:55:12] <deafmelone> maybe plancha?
[2:55:13] <Mibeador> general way to tell if something is true is if the red bar for damage shrinks at all before a move hits
[2:55:28] <Mibeador> so you can easily tell that what they're doing right now is fake
[2:56:00] <powerprotoman> so woolie Gooey is the god teir
[2:56:08] <@Solidus_113> Sakurai hasn't been Kirby for a long time
[2:56:08] <ggbhtg> REAL TO ME DAMMIT
[2:56:12] <SomersaultJustice> it works for mind games
[2:56:16] <%thatsocrunchy> Kirby smash???
[2:56:17] <ggbhtg> THEY WERE REAL TO ME DAMMIT
[2:56:18] <%Wool> They're real to Woolie and that counts
[2:56:21] <mushplush77> Sakurai hasn’t been with Kirby since Air Ride
[2:56:25] <Mibeador> definitely good if your opponent doesn't air dodge
[2:56:27] <%emperordread> emperordread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Dedicating this shoutout to the Dokage Minh - your spiteful troll energy is my spirit animal. But I'll always be #TeamReggie woolieKICKDAD woolieMINHMAX
[2:56:32] <GeltonZ> Right technically Sakurai is Dedede
[2:56:40] <Mibeador> Gooey is high tier
[2:56:46] <powerprotoman> reggie picked the boss character
[2:56:48] <Mibeador> do his fly, he gets to shoot lasers
[2:56:55] <+KgKid51> Dark matter monkaS
[2:56:59] <ggbhtg> Kirby is the unending
[2:57:00] <%Solidnick18> not really
[2:57:00] <Mibeador> MK is the boss character, man gets an infinite from any part of the screen
[2:57:02] <ggbhtg> the undying
[2:57:05] <Thunderhog> lytWORRY
[2:57:12] <ggbhtg> kirby the evermore
[2:57:12] <%Solidnick18> he is an endless void
[2:57:12] <CruzCtrl90> woolie flexes his fight knowledge with his kirby prophet...ing.
[2:57:21] <ggbhtg> SHAPED like a friend
[2:57:40] <+Lord0Mugen> WHERES FUCKING MARX?!
[2:57:42] <ggbhtg> oh darn
[2:57:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait...
[2:57:47] <ggbhtg> I got blown up

[2:57:53] <papercompass> m6kwD3
[2:58:01] <+Totally_Not_Toby> stage moves you, banned
[2:58:05] <GeltonZ> @Lord0Mugen There is a Marx hat outfit for Kirby.
[2:58:08] <powerprotoman> Gooey is also the best character in the game because he has a tool for every situation
[2:58:08] <+Lord0Mugen> Cant have god without the devil! lol
[2:58:26] <ggbhtg> I've only played Kirby 64 and Air Ride to completion, I'm a fraud LUL
[2:58:27] <Mibeador> air camping is really strong in this game for all the non kirby characters except Dedede, cause they don't have to puff when they jump
[2:58:42] <Mibeador> and Gooey has a way to fly indefinitely which is very infuriating
[2:58:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> 1v1, Green Gardens, No Items, Fighter Kirby only
[2:58:57] <+Lord0Mugen> @GeltonZ you mean Mirror Kirby? i know about him
[2:59:05] <ggbhtg> RERORERO combos?
[2:59:15] <ggbhtg> oh wait you died, nvm
[2:59:23] <GeltonZ> @Lord0Mugen Nah I was looking up a hat list for this game and it's specifically a Marx hat.
[2:59:30] <zashrin777> woolie with the comeback
[2:59:30] <ggbhtg> What other charcters Reg? Kappa
[2:59:32] <+Lord0Mugen> oh
[2:59:40] <DSD24> Master Hand Land!
[2:59:42] <SomersaultJustice> at least that marx hat has a little bowtie
[2:59:43] <@Solidus_113> all stages have gimmicks
[2:59:53] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus you can turn off hazards
[2:59:55] <+tacostarvedbeast> i wonder what woolies favorite kirby mini game is? im partial to the samurai duel mini game
[2:59:58] <GeltonZ> I just...I want cheerleader Kirby. I cannot believe that exists.
[3:00:11] <+cubbywolf> kirby exists as everything unbeliever
[3:00:15] <DSD24> @tacostarvedbeast I loved that one!
[3:00:24] <SomersaultJustice> I liked the falling floor one from 64
[3:00:28] <ggbhtg> wait until he hears about cheerleader Link....
[3:00:40] <+Lord0Mugen> this doesnt play like a wrestler like i thought he would
[3:00:41] <+cubbywolf> lol
[3:00:43] <+Totally_Not_Toby> reggie GOT IT

[3:01:09] <LoneFonte> LUL
[3:01:09] <GeltonZ> @ggbhtg OH RIGHT! I remember now!
[3:01:13] <Mibeador> if you wanna play Wrestler well spam the drill kick
[3:01:13] <EternalJedi> FuqBoiSlim is Yoyo a sport?
[3:01:16] <+Walopoh> Canadian Hockey Kirby
[3:01:23] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months!
[3:01:26] <SomariMan> There is an option.
[3:01:29] <+Lord0Mugen> So would you say Wrestler kirby has no armor on his moves? ;)
[3:01:31] <powerprotoman> you can turn off items and hazards
[3:01:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> @eternaljedi Yes gwdSche
[3:01:38] <+cubbywolf> show me your moves
[3:01:42] <@Solidus_113> on the character select I'm pretty sure

[3:02:01] <EternalJedi> FuqBoiSlim then there is a sports kirby limesLUL also there's Curling Kirby in 64
[3:02:08] <%Wool> They haven't unlocked Shoto Kirby yet

[3:02:11] <+tacostarvedbeast> bummer that bloody roar doesn't work great on parsec
[3:02:17] <Saltmeisterr> yeah sakurai hasn't worked on a kirby game in years
[3:02:26] <YakumoYomi> Blocks won't save you from grabs
[3:02:30] <+Lord0Mugen> @tacostarvedbeast it doesnt?!
[3:02:33] <+cubbywolf> lets go
[3:02:39] <ggbhtg> wha happun sajamMouse
[3:02:41] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus the legal way to play is items off, hazards off, specific stage list, Meta Knight infinite is banned. Also to turn off items and hazards go back to the screen where you select team or versus and there's a rules option on Y
[3:02:43] <DSD24> Kirby dancing like Passione
[3:02:46] <+Itselguapo> dancin on your grave
[3:02:49] <+cubbywolf> woolie used an item to win thats wa happen
[3:02:55] <+Lord0Mugen> i thought Yo!Videogames did a few matches of it on parsec?
[3:02:58] <+tacostarvedbeast> @Lord0Mugen they tried to make it work later in the stream
[3:03:04] <Style_train_14> Hi woolie and chat

[3:04:04] <Potatoidea> Oh, it's Dedede's Ultra sprite
[3:04:17] <powerprotoman> hammer is low teir ddd is slightly better because he has a projectile
[3:04:18] <+cubbywolf> son goku

[3:04:30] <+cubbywolf> Z O N E
[3:04:30] <ggbhtg> you have a STAFF Reg, why you are playing close range
[3:04:34] <Zuzu_Pachulia> billy kane kirby
[3:04:36] <SomersaultJustice> staff has a counter
[3:04:36] <%Struggleful> I'm waiting for the Compton Crip Kirby to come out.
[3:04:39] <Meltgar> You have the RANGE reggie
[3:04:39] <+cubbywolf> lol howd that mis
[3:04:40] <DSD24> Doing some Kilik combos
[3:04:43] <Mibeador> some people think D3 is worse than hammer cause all his moves are slower and he has the giant hurtbox
[3:04:48] <DedlokPM> Wukong Kirby
[3:04:49] <KaironFortressKnight> Gief vs Dhalsim over here
[3:04:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> Try that on my Rolento Kirby
[3:04:55] <+tacostarvedbeast> hmm could any other character have a legit fighting game with just him/her self?
[3:05:01] <%Wool> NO WAVEDASH
[3:05:02] <Mibeador> you have direction air dodges, just not down
[3:05:10] <Saltmeisterr> again

[3:05:17] <%Struggleful> Try that on my Potemkin Kirby
[3:05:18] <@Solidus_113> he didn't
[3:05:19] <DedlokPM> @tacostarvedbeast Goku rooSmug
[3:05:20] <Mibeador> sakurai didn't work on this
[3:05:20] <YakumoYomi> Probably not
[3:05:24] <Saltmeisterr> sakurai doesn't work on kirby games anymore
[3:05:25] <ggbhtg> Reggie being a rushdown Zoner btw LUL

[3:05:36] <Meltgar> LUL
[3:05:39] <glass_marcus> I don't think sakurai has touched kirby since airride
[3:05:41] <%emperordread> Wavedashing ruined smash #unpopularbuttrue
[3:05:43] <+Lord0Mugen> that sounds like a Sakboy thing to do
[3:05:44] <+cubbywolf> reggie gave up and tried to learn controls while woolie rushes him down
[3:05:45] <ggbhtg> Wavedash plank
[3:05:48] <alephalpha> wavedash just give sup astock
[3:06:03] <powerprotoman> you have to unlock hats for each kirby
[3:06:04] <YakumoYomi> Haven't unlocked them
[3:06:06] <DerpioParty> I think all powers have alternate hats, but you have to unlock them first
[3:06:12] <+cubbywolf> can you unlock stuff just playing mp?
[3:06:17] <Mibeador> yes
[3:06:19] <SomersaultJustice> yep
[3:06:21] <Mibeador> but you won't get MK or D3
[3:06:22] <GeltonZ> @cubbywolf So it seems
[3:06:27] <Mibeador> they're unlocked through story
[3:06:29] <SomersaultJustice> there is
[3:06:38] <Mibeador> and there's a special version of D3 and MK at the end of story

[3:17:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nintendo Twitter would call Woolie a sweaty tryhard for that opinion
[3:17:44] <ggbhtg> @Mibeador
[3:17:44] <nintega010> nope Yovideogames is the optimal smash bros play
[3:17:50] <Zourath> Chess with random Chance Times.
[3:17:57] <ggbhtg> 2 - 1
[3:18:11] <ggbhtg> @Mibeador Is Reggie missing some tech?
[3:18:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok so yeah! 4 play party? items on. 1v1? items off

[3:18:44] <%Solidnick18> this is an amazing stage
[3:18:50] <heartlesshealer> hope you liked Great Cave Offensive in Smash! =)
[3:18:52] <+violet_city> this stage is the worst
[3:18:58] <+violet_city> the absolute worst
[3:18:59] <%Solidnick18> a smashers nightmare
[3:19:09] <+violet_city> i literally quit tower runs if i get this stage early
[3:19:23] <%Struggleful> Anakin Skywalker kirby when?
[3:19:32] <Flowlethal> this is worst stage
[3:19:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> shoutout to the great cave offensive stage where you can hit a ceiling at 100% and just explode
[3:19:42] <ggbhtg> back turn cancels?!

[3:20:01] <heartlesshealer> @FuqBoiSlim it lets you just explode now? When did that happen?
[3:20:04] <+violet_city> it's not even good for projectile characters cus the projectiles disappear in the lava
[3:20:07] <+violet_city> so dumb
[3:20:10] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:20:20] <ggbhtg> winner stays ooooon
[3:20:22] <GeltonZ> OH YEAH! I wanna know how bad the netcode is!
[3:20:34] <Saltmeisterr> from what i've seen
[3:20:35] <SixthSun2> "Hazards Off", but not really, just like Smash
[3:20:36] <@Menitta> YO LETS GO ONLINE
[3:20:37] <ggbhtg> online? LUL
[3:20:38] <%Solidnick18> yeeee
[3:20:40] <ggbhtg> no fucking way
[3:20:41] <+violet_city> it's better than smash ultimate
[3:20:42] <@Menitta> its garbage lmao
[3:20:43] <Saltmeisterr> nintendo quality
[3:20:43] <%Wool> FORCED 2V2 YEYEYE
[3:20:46] <+violet_city> LULW
[3:20:49] <SomersaultJustice> this game does have lobbies lol
[3:20:50] <%Solidnick18> see that online at work
[3:20:50] <@Menitta> No its fucking not @violet_city
[3:20:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> @heartlesshealer i think its when you hit the magma parts at 100% you just die. I don't know when i think it was Ultimate
[3:20:57] <Louie_Salmon> Okay that was combo
[3:20:58] <SomersaultJustice> better lobbies than strive Kappa
[3:20:58] <@Menitta> It is almost unplayable
[3:21:05] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Mordexai0
[3:21:08] <@Menitta> Like I have never seen a worse online
[3:21:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> @somersaultjustice gottem
[3:21:13] <+violet_city> i played like 10 games in a row w no lag that's unheard of in smash
[3:21:31] <@Menitta> You got the 10 guys who have a lan adapter then
[3:21:33] <heartlesshealer> @FuqBoiSlim That used to not be there, so I'm glad that exists with the magma in that stage
[3:21:40] <+violet_city> and i didnt even have a lan adapter myself
[3:21:40] <ggbhtg> Damn, Reggie soul stealing?
[3:21:44] <+violet_city> which is the crazy part
[3:21:47] <+Qsmash_> I don't know how they made Suplex even cooler than it was but they did it
[3:21:48] <@Menitta> I've had nothing but 20 minute matches that were unplayable
[3:21:49] <+Rekinsinn> So is wrestler like suplex +?
[3:21:52] <+violet_city> i HAVE one i just didnt bother using it
[3:21:54] <ggbhtg> 0 - 1
[3:21:55] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:22:01] <kingkaito1123> Reggie found his main? Because that was a good ass victory.
[3:22:03] <SomersaultJustice> I've had 50 / 50 online
[3:22:06] <%Solidnick18> mac sucks in the air
[3:22:06] <Saltmeisterr> god
[3:22:09] <@Menitta> Like Smash is at least playable with delay
[3:22:12] <Flowlethal> wrestler is incineroar and suplexs love child?
[3:22:12] <anuchallengertwitch> Yo when's getting into "Grim adventures of Billy and Mandy video game" that game's basically power Stone
[3:22:16] <Saltmeisterr> little mac is sad
[3:22:20] <%Kain5707> @Menitta can you create a lobby?
[3:22:23] <@Menitta> no
[3:22:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> we're just gonna have to accept that even after making us pay a subscription, Nintendo will just have straight dookie butter ass trash online.
[3:22:25] <@Menitta> you cannot
[3:22:26] <%Kain5707> fuck
[3:22:30] <heartlesshealer> oh god, billy and mandy powerstone
[3:22:36] <+violet_city> yeah the online system as a whole is straight ass
[3:22:39] <SomersaultJustice> you can, but you can only invite friends to it
[3:22:43] <ggbhtg> @anuchallengertwitch or just.....play Power Stone. on NullDC BEAR.
[3:22:54] <+violet_city> but the experience i had was like
[3:22:57] <+Mordexai0> It's Actually Better than Smash Bros Online At Least a lot of people had said that on my end zyzxLmao
[3:22:58] <+violet_city> not unplayable
[3:23:19] <+violet_city> i legit had a better experience with this than with ult, and i use a lan adapter every time for ult

[3:24:46] <alephalpha> woolie not gonna try yo yo kirby?
[3:24:47] <SomersaultJustice> I think everyone's unlocks are in the same order

[3:25:32] <+TheOneCalledRock> damn
[3:25:32] <DedlokPM> @alephalpha woolieMIRIN There is only Wrestler Kirby
[3:25:36] <%Wool> Reggie unlocks his Ryu at Rank 15
[3:25:39] <Saltmeisterr> although i think its hilarious that this game got shadow dropped on the same day as Rivals of Aether DE
[3:25:42] <kingkaito1123> Kirbymania
[3:25:43] <heartlesshealer> I see Whip kirby
[3:25:44] <%ledshamans> ledshamans subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months!
[3:25:55] <SomersaultJustice> reggie would be fighter
[3:25:55] <@Menitta> Ninja is INSANE in this game
[3:25:56] <%Solidnick18> ninja is great
[3:26:03] <+violet_city> ninja is so cool
[3:26:11] <Saltmeisterr> ninja cool
[3:26:15] <SixthSun2> Ninja unlock is a ways away, btw
[3:26:25] <@Menitta> I dont remember Ninja in Star Allies but they buffed Ninja
[3:26:42] <@Solidus_113> dash > up > down is a basic sword combo
[3:26:44] <spacecatstreams> wuli
[3:26:55] <SomersaultJustice> the wrestler air kick can crossup
[3:27:12] <+cubbywolf> S I C K
[3:27:19] <Manwad> this looks fuckin' radical
[3:27:30] <alephalpha> woolie with the airthrows like it's guilty egar
[3:27:30] <+Reaverund> Does sakurai have anything to do with this game?
[3:27:33] <@Solidus_113> no
[3:27:36] <Saltmeisterr> no
[3:27:40] <ggbhtg> 2 - 2
[3:27:41] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye crossup!
[3:27:50] <Saltmeisterr> sakurai hasn't touched a kirby game in years
[3:27:55] <heartlesshealer> chop has a small bit of hitbox that reaches behind? :0c
[3:27:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> he hasn't done anything with kirby since air ride no?
[3:28:05] <%Solidnick18> i like how kirbys soul leaves his body when he get's ko'd
[3:28:06] <kingkaito1123> I wonder if Sakurai would put Wrestler Kirby in Smash. I would be happy.
[3:28:09] <Louie_Salmon> I guess that would kinda be a fast-fall, doing the downair and cancelling it
[3:28:11] <@Menitta> he left Hal after Air Ride yes
[3:28:41] <%Kain5707> i wonder if hed ever go back to kirb
[3:28:44] <+KgKid51> this stage be like FBBlock
[3:28:44] <+TheOneCalledRock> what does the split in the health bar for?
[3:28:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> is that like a special meter?
[3:29:01] <SomersaultJustice> I want sakurai to revive a franchise again like he did with kid icarus
[3:29:04] <%Solidnick18> huh
[3:29:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> nah I think some characters just have multiple health bars
[3:29:12] <ggbhtg> 2 - 3
[3:29:25] <%RyTYoung> I would like a sequel to Kid Icarus Uprising ngl
[3:29:41] <SomersaultJustice> I want a sequel that doesn't shorten my life
[3:29:43] <heartlesshealer> I like my wrists tho
[3:29:44] <+TenguGemini> saaaaaame
[3:29:54] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[3:29:55] <ggbhtg> @RyTYoung not until you feel Sakurai's wrist pain
[3:29:59] <glass_marcus> My wrist have had 8 years to recover
[3:30:01] <ggbhtg> and play the hardest mode
[3:30:03] <glass_marcus> Im ready
[3:30:16] <%RyTYoung> Imagine using motion controls or standard aiming on the pro controller on the switch tho, like Splatoon
[3:30:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> KI:U 2 would make you aim with the IR Joycon and my arm isn't ready for that kind of damage
[3:30:18] <heartlesshealer> carpal tunnel is forever~
[3:30:23] <%Kain5707> hey at least it wouldnt be a handheld game
[3:30:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:30:26] <%RyTYoung> it would woild
[3:30:28] <%RyTYoung> work*
[3:30:29] <+TenguGemini> a switch sequel to KI Uprising wouldnt need a crazy control scheme, it could use both sticks
[3:30:34] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:30:37] <heartlesshealer> reggie LUL
[3:30:40] <%Kain5707> maybe gyro?
[3:30:55] <GeltonZ> Just start by porting the first game.
[3:31:01] <heartlesshealer> bomb seems trash for 1v1
[3:31:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> I played Uprising with the default controls ONCE and then I just set the reticle aiming to the letter buttons because fuck that
[3:31:05] <ggbhtg> EX SPROSIVE
[3:31:08] <%Kain5707> the nes one?
[3:31:10] <ggbhtg> ex-sprosive
[3:31:17] <ggbhtg> EX - splosive
[3:31:21] <ggbhtg> DARK WIRE
[3:31:25] <%RyTYoung> @fuqboislim I wish I could've done that...
[3:31:41] <GeltonZ> @Kain5707 Oh nah I meant Uprising but...I mean...Kid Icarus Collection is a good idea. There's a Gameboy one too.
[3:31:54] <Saltmeisterr> zoners rise up
[3:31:55] <%Kain5707> oh yea i forgot about that one
[3:31:57] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:31:59] <ggbhtg> the epitome of you got some good hits in
[3:32:02] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:32:03] <+TenguGemini> have either of them played as gooey yet?
[3:32:06] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[3:32:14] <%Kain5707> i think someone made a rom hack for uprising to use twin stick
[3:32:21] <%Solidnick18> reggie played as gooey
[3:32:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @rytyoung obviously its not as accurate as the stylus but you can make it work. I still beat the story at 2.0 and won a few online matches
[3:32:25] <GeltonZ> @TenguGemini Yeah Reggie did for a minute
[3:32:25] <heartlesshealer> I have not seen one Gooey, but I also got up to make dinner at one point
[3:32:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> *5.0
[3:32:36] <heartlesshealer> yay I'll catch vod for gooey later
[3:33:11] <SomersaultJustice> such an elegant dance
[3:33:35] <%RyTYoung> @fuqboislim I would imagine for multiplayer it would've been much easier to play, I could never get past around 7.5 and onward so I wonder if twin sticks would help that or not
[3:33:41] <ggbhtg> I would just Jump > neutral bomb drop
