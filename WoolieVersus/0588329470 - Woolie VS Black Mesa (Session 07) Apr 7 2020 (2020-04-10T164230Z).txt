[0:03:46] <+CoPowah> @arkv01 yes...
[0:03:52] <SummonerMagno> it was a couples therapy for Woolie and Chat
[0:03:55] <pennykettle_> Woolie gained new crippling self doubts in that episode. That was a gaslighting episode he did not deserve LUL
[0:04:03] <major_gnuisance> Hi, Woolie

[0:04:56] <DatAsuna> "gaming industried us"
[0:04:56] <%Irridium> by fuckin' Jeff Lowe LUL
[0:04:58] <$StaceMcGate> Jeff Lowe tweeted
[0:04:59] <%SirGO0SE> we were saying it in the chat but it was flooded
[0:04:59] <%ArtsyFoxo> GrayDFox subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:05:02] <pennykettle_> maybe WE were lied to
[0:05:14] <VidulaSaix> It's probably just cut footage they didn't think people would want to see
[0:05:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Fucking Carole Baskins
[0:05:17] <+Razputin217> CAROL FUCKIN' BASKINS
[0:05:20] <petwisk> on disk DLC documentary series
[0:05:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Jeff Lowe said it so it might not be true
[0:05:32] <TheMorilo> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie, I normally watch the Twitch archives, is it better for you if I watch it on Youtube?
[0:05:33] <+Graem> Carol is a true demon
[0:05:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> Does this have to do with Berserk?
[0:05:47] <restingbones> Oh my god EVERYONE is talking about Tiger King, I can't watch it!
[0:05:48] <%jiggy_snipe> it was more of the aftermath of how Joe affected his employees
[0:05:58] <deviljhojho_> my take is that tigers have bad luck
[0:06:04] <DatAsuna> well not never mind joe
[0:06:05] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:06:05] <DesertPenguin> I can't watch this show. It's just gonna make me angry

[0:06:13] <%XenoDandelion> REGGIE needs a podcast
[0:06:16] <DesertPenguin> Can we just stop with the zeitgeist already lol
[0:06:19] <major_gnuisance> I apologize for making you feel on the spot with that twitter DM. I was still salty about the way you dismissed the Steam Controller back in the say. That was shitty of me and I sincerely apologize.
[0:06:20] <pennykettle_> Im not comfortable with the pitchfork mob after Carol, a documentary can convince you of anything. I hate her too buuttt
[0:06:26] <%Prevot> that bitch as guilty as OJ
[0:06:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Actually fuck Doc Antle in the most

[0:07:32] <+schlager087> dude who had an atf agent chopped up on his land turns out to be most chill dude
[0:07:32] <major_gnuisance> I still haven't found the point where you tried grokking the Steam Controller on stream, though.
[0:07:38] <unit24> his music was all lip synched
[0:07:42] <%XenoDandelion> woolieREGGIEFUL
[0:07:58] <unit24> apparently he got some other people to make music for him for exposure, and then took the credit for it all
[0:08:06] <@Solidus_113> Dub or sub?
[0:08:09] <%SirGO0SE> ZENITSU PogChamp
[0:08:17] <@Solidus_113> Berserk has a good dub
[0:08:17] <%SirGO0SE> that theme fucking slaps

[0:09:22] <rcand9> lies and slander
[0:09:23] <unit24> the actual hirasawa soundtrack is sick as shit though
[0:09:24] <$StaceMcGate> Main thing missing from Tiger King is the 2005 PETA lawsuit/investigation into Joe Exotic that radicalized him
[0:09:25] <+gutlesscoward> does that include the 4kids dub One Piece OP?
[0:09:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> PUT YOUR GWASSES ON

[0:12:48] <unit24> oh yeah didn't hirasawa still do some music for the 2016/2017 anime?
[0:12:48] <+DreyfussFrost> Oh shit, Paranoia Agent? PogChamp
[0:12:51] <AxelCezar> CUUUUBE
[0:12:51] <extradopeness> I got a copy of paprika for 75 cents from a thrift store
[0:12:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> also Hundred Yearss War and My Brother
[0:12:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> @commandersqueaks he already read the manga
[0:12:56] <unit24> he did ash crow
[0:12:57] <MyNameIsRasus> MY BROTHER
[0:12:57] <DatAsuna> Speaking of stuff that never got the right anime treatment
[0:12:57] <OldManDeckardCain> best song is dub guts's love song "My love for you is like a truck BERSERKER!"
[0:13:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> David Productions is a hero.
[0:13:03] <MyNameIsRasus> COME JOIN ME
[0:13:04] <%arkv01> but the jojo OVAs were fun tho
[0:13:09] <DatAsuna> everyone assumes I'm a sao name, but it's a negima name
[0:13:11] <shameimarusen> His DreamCast tracks are also Bangers
[0:13:14] <@Solidus_113> There's not enough money you can throw at Berserk's art style to be faithful
[0:13:17] <dukenux> i still need to watch that Jojo OVA
[0:13:18] <DatAsuna> and negima had a BUNCH of animes and OVAs
[0:13:21] <DatAsuna> that all sucked
[0:13:26] <%Haarute> SPEEDWAGON WASN'T IN IT
[0:13:32] <dukenux> LUL
[0:13:32] <%andrei11dr> I like the God Hand version of Forces more than the original personali
[0:13:32] <+DreyfussFrost> @datasuna That's almost worse LUL
[0:13:36] <SinnerBeta> JoJo Christmas Special
[0:13:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> It's not as bad as the Star Wars Christmas Special
[0:13:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> You CANT continue the 90s anime because it cut out lots of important stuff that doesnt matter in the Golden Age arc but would have mattered a lot in a future series
[0:13:42] <+Graem> The wryyyy one?
[0:13:45] <MyNameIsRasus> The part 3 OVAs
[0:13:47] <akman14> You mean the 2007 one?
[0:13:48] <%karldeck> Satoshi kon
[0:13:50] <%karldeck> As well
[0:13:53] <+Rabbitmage> the Jojo OVA was like a horror series
[0:13:55] <%Ecchigun> bonjour
[0:13:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Phantom Blood movie is more priceless than the fcking stand arrows
[0:13:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> The OVA introduces the WORLD and Dio fucking around with it in such a scary way
[0:13:58] <DatAsuna> The only good negima animation is one OVA that just did 4 random chapters without connection
[0:13:58] <%SirGO0SE> that ova is LUL
[0:14:03] <+Graem> I've only seen one from the eighties or early nineties
[0:14:06] <Sapphire_Breeze> that OVA is sick
[0:14:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Graem no a Phantom Blood movie. Araki has wiped it from the face of the earth
[0:14:07] <%andrei11dr> DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE CANCELED MOVIE
[0:14:09] <MyNameIsRasus> They got some cool stuff
[0:14:15] <@Solidus_113> Those OVA's have some really good moments
[0:14:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> They're dumber
[0:14:24] <+wunp_fxs> veeeery different
[0:14:25] <unit24> watched the first OVA and honestly was kind of bored
[0:14:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> OH NO
[0:14:27] <DatAsuna> The OVAs push the horror and action more than the weirdness
[0:14:27] <MonstarGrrrl> oh no
[0:14:27] <VidulaSaix> BIG SPILLS
[0:14:27] <%jiggy_snipe> oh no
[0:14:28] <ardbart> the English VA kicks ass in that version
[0:14:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Where's he going with that stop-sign?"

[0:14:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> the 90s Jojo OVAs are "good" but they're NOT JOJO. They're not fabulous.

[0:23:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHAT
[0:23:17] <Bailey__gaming> is woolie Buzz lightyear?
[0:23:18] <unit24> I think only one OVA was directed by satoshi kon
[0:23:20] <+Reaverund> Berserk 2012 or whatever wasnt too bad
[0:23:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE WORLD IS SO BOSS
[0:23:28] <akman14> They got his eyes!
[0:23:29] <unit24> like the second to last episode or something
[0:23:32] <%andrei11dr> Ever since Woolie has beaten Doom ,the dark forces are trying to destroy the stream
[0:23:33] <jevichrono> SatoshiCon when?
[0:23:34] <%karldeck> @unit24 It's the best so it's ok
[0:23:35] <nothuzad> the movies arent too bad but the first oen si certainly the weakest
[0:23:36] <TigerClaws12> @Bailey__gaming EVA unit
[0:23:43] <DatAsuna> It has a better d'arby too
[0:23:50] <dukenux> i can see that
[0:23:52] <+Ancopro> it's very good
[0:23:56] <+YabbaTroll> yo fucking dio dissapearing with the knife dropping is so fucking rad
[0:23:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> the ova where they fight dio were directed by him right?
[0:24:02] <%LordSDB> We should watch live on stream right now.....
[0:24:04] <+YabbaTroll> and the whole senator philips part
[0:24:09] <+RowenCleric> seeing Dio move in stopped time from an outside perspective is great
[0:24:09] <+Rabbitmage> I liked the part in the OVA where Super Dio punches all the people apart on the bus
[0:24:11] <%SirGO0SE> its faithful but the flying / time management could have been better
[0:24:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> The world alsod oesn't have this loud noise
[0:24:18] <DatAsuna> I'm still annoyed by how in the anime d'arby's fingers are broken before jotaro breaks them
[0:24:26] <%SirGO0SE> in the anime i mean
[0:24:36] <DatAsuna> That scene is a BEAUTIFUL panning shot
[0:24:38] <%andrei11dr> Except for when they are throwing buildings at each other
[0:24:41] <+BNPhone> !uptime
[0:24:41] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 39 minutes and 18 seconds
[0:24:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> So before Jotaro doesn't see in dios world Dio is just fucking teleporting and causing crazy shit to happen
[0:24:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> how kon shows how disorienting seeing the world from the outside was amazing
[0:24:57] <+tuchpi> remember when Pat thought Dio never saw a car? LUL
[0:25:03] <DatAsuna> That's the kind of thing that looks bad when done faithful cause it's just sliding a layer over
[0:25:07] <DatAsuna> it works on a page
[0:25:11] <%andrei11dr> Senator Williams
[0:25:13] <+logoth_> Yeah the OVA was AMAZING
[0:25:16] <%Estuko> A PERFECT gif loop
[0:25:25] <DatAsuna> but in animation you should show it a different way that uses the fact it's animated
[0:25:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> Just show him the webm. I'm sure it's on sakugabooru or smth
[0:25:28] <+Ancopro> yea in the anime he just looks like he teleports, but the ova looks way more natural
[0:25:30] <+Balkespower> that scen was great
[0:25:32] <+Balkespower> *scene
[0:25:41] <%Estuko> The OVA has my FAVORITE variant of DIO's time stop, basicaly an instant and quiet timestop. It's so much more frightening
[0:25:47] <+Reaverund> Imagine what that looks like form Dio's POC lol
[0:25:53] <+Reaverund> pov
[0:26:04] <+Balkespower> the car running over pedestriance was also better
[0:26:21] <%Lion_kun> The OVA replaced a steam roller with a gas tanker. It can fuck off.
[0:26:23] <@akuda_bar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZjQeG7IsQE

[0:26:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ancopro No they don't do it right you have this loud noise and aura thing. OVA dio just fucking VANISHES
[0:26:32] <@akuda_bar> what woolie's talking about
[0:26:35] <arvidonfire> You're approaching me?
[0:26:46] <%Sparkseid> JoJo Part 3 OVAs
[0:26:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> @akuda_bar the stardust crusaders ovas
[0:26:47] <+logoth_> @akuda_bar The JoJo OVA
[0:26:49] <%Lion_kun> HOOOOH
[0:26:53] <unit24> who here has seen the gif of dio carrying polnareff down the stairs in the stopped time?
[0:26:53] <@akuda_bar> i know i linked it.
[0:26:54] <StrikingEarth> Peeps here for games? lol, get comfy
[0:26:55] <@Solidus_113> The OVA had a really cool moment with the Enyaba fight, when all the zombies jump Jotaro in the bar
[0:26:56] <+wunp_fxs> wow different voice
[0:26:57] <unit24> it's magical
[0:27:02] <DatAsuna> also the bit in the train car, kind of pillar man vibes but it's a big shock and gore spike too.
[0:27:04] <%Estuko> @doc_ock_rokc it's amazing as fuck, it really makes him terrifying.
[0:27:07] <+mythboy99> are we starting or ending?
[0:27:09] <+Rabbitmage> The OVA was a lot more serious in tone
[0:27:14] <%andrei11dr> Im kinda sad that part 5 didn't do things out of King Crimsons pov more
[0:27:14] <@akuda_bar> @mythboy99 starting
[0:27:19] <nopgnikatnight> cool
[0:27:20] <+Ancopro> its worth checking out
[0:27:30] <DatAsuna> the 04 one is lame
[0:27:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> I like the naisally DIO from the OVA
[0:27:44] <DatAsuna> "what if enyaba was hot?"
[0:27:45] <@Solidus_113> the 2000 version was alright...
[0:27:52] <suddenlyscorched> I left after Woolie spilled on his cube. Is that actually EVA-01 pajamas?
[0:27:56] <astrofalcon1> and then david pro did it
[0:27:57] <DesertPenguin> Part 1 is trash? What?
[0:28:01] <+Graem> >prequels
[0:28:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> David save us.
[0:28:13] <%andrei11dr> I've never even seen those
[0:28:14] <Lewisisphat> yes!
[0:28:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> why is woolie crossdressing
[0:28:15] <dukenux> @desertpenguin hes talking about OVAs
[0:28:18] <nothuzad> DesertPenguin of the old OVA stuff not the new stuff
[0:28:20] <DatAsuna> Honestly I preferredthe way they did part 1/2 to 3
[0:28:21] <DesertPenguin> werd
[0:28:22] <+logoth_> It needs a hunter x hunter
[0:28:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> he's talking about the later ovas. that take place before they got to Egypt
[0:28:26] <DatAsuna> you don't have to adapt the filler
[0:28:26] <Sapphire_Breeze> Miura will allow more IDOLMASTER anime instead
[0:28:30] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus Did you block or ignore me on Twitter? Just want to know if I'm apologizing into the void. Again, I'm sincerely sorry for being shitty.
[0:28:30] <+Ancopro> david production never loses its luster
[0:28:30] <+tuchpi> @desertpenguin old ova movie of part 1 is trash yes :)
[0:28:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> What about 3D anime berserk not done by dummies, a'la dorohedoro
[0:28:38] <%SirGO0SE> post spill timeline
[0:28:40] <%Gogogolem> Woolie worked hard to escape the office cubicle and now he embraces the cube.
[0:28:47] <awalr> i can't believe woolie spilled his meat on that guy to get him fired

[0:32:26] <+DreyfussFrost> I HAD to buy a 360 K&M converter back in the day to comfortably play Halo. Alternate controllers have existed since way before then too.

[0:32:37] <%andrei11dr> Iea as soon as im getting home im downloading that shit
[0:32:38] <%optimasmaximas> I can not believe P5R has a MUCH higher metacritic than FF7R
[0:32:40] <+budyd> oh wow. that's a look
[0:32:40] <pennykettle_> tuchpi FUCK do they make those
[0:32:41] <%Ecchigun> i just noticed the suit lol

[0:32:50] <DatAsuna> GIFG duodeccim never

[0:33:01] <+DreyfussFrost> @optimasmaximas You'll see why.
[0:33:01] <%The_Timo> @GeneralSCPatton I wanna mock up an Heva suit now haha
[0:33:02] <%Ecchigun> hi reggie and woolie
[0:33:05] <CazadorDeWulf> Woolie is Woolie
[0:33:11] <CazadorDeWulf> And I love him
[0:33:16] <%andrei11dr> But apparently there are way more side quests
[0:33:18] <awalr> controller+mouse is just wiimote+nunchuck level 2 change my mind
[0:33:25] <KamelGuru> People getting it early and mining it says it's up until leaving Midgar
[0:33:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's just titled Woolie.
[0:33:33] <DatAsuna> well he gave you the cliffnotes version
[0:33:43] <JetpackMcQuack> I imagine its structered like FF15
[0:33:45] <pennykettle_> Woolie was totally reasonable, he is getting gaslit by means of hundreds of voices saying different things
[0:33:52] <%SirGO0SE> i love how the clip is just called Woolie
[0:33:58] <+Rabbitmage> Never rely on Pat to be your therapist
[0:34:00] <DatAsuna> I can't believe woolie killed a man for liking eggs
[0:34:09] <@Solidus_113> The term was Sealioning
[0:34:11] <%funny_valintine> funny_valintine subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:34:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @datasuna Woolie killed Legosi!?
[0:34:13] <%jiggy_snipe> think youtube apology
[0:34:18] <arvidonfire> But blame is scary!
[0:34:35] <DatAsuna> @CommanderSqueaks and ate him raw
[0:35:02] <pennykettle_> he ate a gamestop employee
[0:35:05] <JetpackMcQuack> You don’t have control over how people perceive you
[0:35:05] <DatAsuna> tl;dr wanting to self improve is weird
[0:35:16] <%jiggy_snipe> shocking ikr
[0:35:16] <asurite_warrior> The suit woolies wear really does compliment the cube
[0:35:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Just do the best you can
[0:35:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> self improvement? cringe...
[0:35:27] <%andrei11dr> Having opinions on the internet woolieWUT
[0:35:29] <arvidonfire> OH YEAH
[0:35:43] <%The_Timo> at the same time it comes across as an excuse, because most people don't give a shit hwy you made a mistake, just that you did make the mistake
[0:35:46] <derap41> Woolie finally learning human nature
[0:35:54] <+williss_> woolie is giving reasons, but people most of the time take it as excuses
[0:36:00] <nothuzad> communication is tough
[0:36:01] <+tuchpi> man this Woolie guy cant stop being a shit Kappa
[0:36:03] <MayorRev> Pat comparing it to a YouTube apology video was DEAD ON
[0:36:17] <%jiggy_snipe> @The_Timo which shows they don't care about you avoiding making the mistake again
[0:36:18] <fairore> @nothuzad I've watched devil man crybaby I might be wrong but when i watched it didn't feel as gory compared to its older animations
[0:36:18] <asurite_warrior> The amount of times my dad has told me "excuses are like assholes, everyone has one and they stink"
[0:36:21] <+budyd> ccouldnt we all
[0:36:28] <+Fooguwu> it comes off as "Yes I was wrong, but here's exactly why I was right to be wrong" to some people
[0:36:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is being incredibly mature and wise... sitting in a gamer cube and a EVA onesie. This fucking stream is the best.
[0:36:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:36:42] <%The_Timo> @jiggy_snipe because it already happened lol.
[0:36:44] <nothuzad> fairore did you see the private message?
[0:36:57] <derap41> Its means I don't want to argue anymore but I'm right
[0:36:58] <DesertPenguin> yea
[0:36:59] <%Irridium> you could be more efficient in explaining sometimes but on the other end people could be more open to the explanation and not just assuming it's bs.
[0:36:59] <DesertPenguin> smug
[0:37:03] <%andrei11dr> Its an amalgamation of Woolie talking bad,and people being not that smart
[0:37:21] <fairore> @nothuzad yeah that's why I was responding
[0:37:30] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie vs communication
[0:37:33] <nothuzad> fairore cool
[0:37:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @andrei11dr I think it's more that what Woolie uses sincerely so many people have used insecerely that they're poisoned toward its usage AT ALL.
[0:37:48] <CookieDoughFK> !uptime
[0:37:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 52 minutes and 25 seconds

[0:38:31] <@akuda_bar> it's fine i don't listen to csb anyway so it's new to me woolieREMEMBERS
[0:38:32] <%SirGO0SE> sipsipHellmo
[0:38:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Watch the podcqst reggie LUL
[0:38:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> would ancient greeks have a phobia of money?
[0:38:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> green olives are yummy
[0:39:02] <arvidonfire> @EternalJedi YES PLS
[0:39:23] <%Haarute> it's like you're trying to reach an agreement where you both can move on with your lives because you're both "right" but have NO intention of understanding what other people mean/feel
[0:39:31] <asurite_warrior> I will say that I've seen people talk like woolie before and their looking for the right things to say to end the conversation and not learn. Typically being as blunt as possible and says OK I'm wrong or if not wrong I'm weird and here is why Im weird.
[0:39:38] <%jiggy_snipe> this whole convo spawned because of Woolie's hybrid controller lol
[0:39:50] <majima666> i remember the first time i had an olive. it was when i was on the plane to florida. i thought it was a grape.....never felt so disgusted in my life
[0:39:59] <reonome> we just have to agree to disagree woolie Kappa
[0:40:16] <DatAsuna> Only not what "most" people are hearing it
[0:40:16] <+Wessuri> how about the woman who was afraid of cotton, and they made her confont a man covered entirely in a cotton ball body suit
[0:40:18] <+budyd> The question then is, should we extend a hand to help with the issue as a society; should we force the help on them even if they don't want it; or should we leave them alone completely.
[0:40:20] <+EternalJedi> AxelssonOnFire I've been going backwards through the podcast and hit an old one where Paige filled in limesLUL wish she'd show up again
[0:40:21] <MayorRev> teachers can be dumbasses
[0:40:23] <DatAsuna> ome of us hear it as intended
[0:40:28] <Meltgar> What's with the Burgers and Sandwiches with the olive on top?
[0:40:34] <DatAsuna> cause people are weird
[0:40:36] <derap41> Is Woolie an Alien?
[0:40:50] <asurite_warrior> Agree to disagree to me means, "Lets end this conversation, because we can't get to an end of it" which is honestly pretty unsatisfying.
[0:40:51] <%jiggy_snipe> EVA
[0:40:51] <MayorRev> my algebra teacher told me that bank checks will be rejected if they're not written in cursive, I feel your pain
[0:40:55] <%NWannabe> more like an EVANGelion
[0:40:57] <majima666> i mean, olives are ok with other stuff. but yeah, that turned me off eating olives on their own lol
[0:40:58] <+Ancopro> When i hear it it sounds so dismissive of the whatever the arguement was about
[0:40:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @derap41 he's cosplaying Unit 01, which is.......sort of an alien? it's complicated
[0:41:00] <nothuzad> Live and Learn... hanging on the edge of tomorrow :)
[0:41:03] <%andrei11dr> That's the reason why I have so much respect for someone that grow up in coult and get out of it as an adult, Going against something encoded into you at young age is incredibly hard
[0:41:05] <Iwashi94> @WoolieVersus to be fair Pat kind of misunderstood sealioning, iirc it's just someone pretending to be civil and asking for opinions, but just wants to enrage you with his shitty views
[0:41:08] <Mako_Kreutzev> please me woolie
[0:41:09] <+tuchpi> lets agree to disagree is the funniest LUL
[0:41:09] <+EternalJedi> a LOT of communication is context, which can change based on who is hearing it
[0:41:29] <+DreyfussFrost> @woolieversus The part you're missing because it's SO foreign to you is that some people don't care and you can't make them. You can bring a horse to water but you can't make it listen with an open mind. The harder you try, the more they'll resist. You would be happier to learn how to tell who has made up their mind and disengaging with them.
[0:41:35] <DatAsuna> But also sometimes the world is wrong
[0:41:42] <@Solidus_113> how about those video games
[0:41:42] <reonome> @budyd the whole point is that there is no blanket solution
[0:41:44] <antthefool> Bless that Eva onesie
[0:41:44] <KaiserMario> Woolie is saying some rerious shit, whilist dressed as a doofus
[0:41:45] <%Vorga1339> psychological self deconstruction is the content I come to woolie vs for
[0:41:45] <DatAsuna> and you gotta come out shooting
[0:41:45] <%jiggy_snipe> does anyone every reply no, to let's agree to disagree? lol
[0:41:47] <%ArtsyFoxo> NOW FOR BURRAKU MESA

[0:42:03] <+EternalJedi> kukstorm EVA
[0:42:05] <+budyd> No denying that one.
[0:42:13] <DatAsuna> Sea lioning is the guy who demands to go on your podcast and debate you
[0:42:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> GET IN THE FUCKING MESA, WOOLIE
[0:42:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sealioning is an attempted Gaslighting of argument
[0:42:24] <kukstorm> Sick

[0:42:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> or rather, GET IN THE FUCKING BORDERWORLD , WOOLIE

[0:43:06] <OldManDeckardCain> that's like half of twitter LUL
[0:43:12] <pennykettle_> its like trying to force someone into debate or something, I dont think it applies to you
[0:43:13] <majima666> what the hell is woolie wearing lmao....this quarantine shit is starting to take its toll
[0:43:15] <gunsrlove> it's basically begin passive aggressive
[0:43:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ancopro its an attempt to throw off and arguement
[0:43:23] <gunsrlove> being*
[0:43:24] <%jiggy_snipe> i think its cool if its sincere
[0:43:26] <%andrei11dr> I think that's trespassing at that point LUL

[0:43:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:43:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Woolie you are not sealioning Sealioning is a false perception

[0:44:45] <TigerClaws12> so this is the power of requiem
[0:44:47] <+YabbaTroll> you are doing it now lmao
[0:44:47] <unit24> woolie your existential crisis can wait, it's time for video games
[0:44:49] <KamelGuru> Better to at least TRY to be polite and courteous than to be an abrasive jackass tho
[0:44:49] <pennykettle_> I feel like woolie is being gaslit, explaining yourself isnt bad
[0:44:50] <FallenVerto81> Just say you're weird and leave it at that. People either accept it or not.
[0:44:52] <%Irridium> you want them to feel your feelings deeply
[0:44:52] <+YabbaTroll> its not possible to not do it
[0:44:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Woolie sealioning is an attempt by an listener to shut down an argument where they can't really shut down the argument
[0:45:00] <%jiggy_snipe> @pennykettle_ thank you
[0:45:02] <Twichty> its just natural defense , a lot of people do it
[0:45:04] <nothuzad> SoushinSen I assume you are preparing for thursday?
[0:45:16] <%SirGO0SE> look at this mans always improving himself :)
[0:45:26] <IsacDee> Isn't the whole thing that he can't see things because of the mic?
[0:45:29] <MassConnect> woolie wants to be understood but doesn't undestand that people don't want to understand

[0:45:49] <%ArtsyFoxo> Woolsworth the improvement Eva
[0:45:50] <SomersaultJustice> let's all just agree that woolie looks cute as an eva
[0:45:51] <DatAsuna> worst out of context I've ever had: one time I told a friend I was rethinking my stance on having babies and they thought I was saying I wanted to have their baby

[0:46:07] <@SoushinSen> Reggie loves feet for example.
[0:46:08] <%SirGO0SE> i cant believe Reggie hates Russians
[0:46:08] <+Testfall_V> Woolie, what you're doing is just what rational people are doing. It's fine to start a conversation with the assumption that the other party is rational as well.
[0:46:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Get Reggie to explain for Woolie from now on lol
[0:46:12] <%Haarute> WOOLIE ATE THAT GAMESTOP EMPLOYEE
[0:46:13] <%doomerskeletor13> So what you’re saying is you hate Russians
[0:46:14] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Actually is PRO-ALIEN, remember XCOM2? Yeah woolie, sweet jetpack
[0:46:14] <+DreyfussFrost> Not wanting to listen is not something that should be encouraged or rewarded. Fuck 'em. Civilized people can have a discussion without projecting bias and pretenses on others.
[0:46:15] <majima666> dont you know that the russians love their children too reggie
[0:46:17] <arvidonfire> Let's just agree to disagree, Woolie Kappa

[0:55:52] <aluddss> oh boy
[0:55:52] <+Reverend_Roscoe> !uptime
[0:55:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 10 minutes
[0:55:55] <MayorRev> B U T
[0:55:58] <unit24> Half-Life 2 Update would probably be best
[0:55:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHECK DONATIONS!
[0:56:00] <brian_peppers1> PC gaming huh amirite or amirite?
[0:56:01] <+Dimfish> half life 2 has aged very well
[0:56:01] <rumuloh> If you die in the game, the engine dies in real life
[0:56:02] <zanzibarian_hamster> That gamer cube looks mad comf
[0:56:03] <+Balkespower> strange it never crashed for me
[0:56:06] <%NWannabe> I cant endorse HL2. Airboat scene man...airboat scene
[0:56:06] <%theman515> It's very faithful to the original Xen
[0:56:08] <Mothman_TV> Epic streamer moment.Exe has stopped working
[0:56:08] <unit24> I think it fixes a bunch of stuff valve never got around to
[0:56:08] <pennykettle_> original xen isnt a flaccid penis its an inverted penis
[0:56:09] <%SirGO0SE> @CommanderSqueaks Dokamom Kingdom sipsipHellmo
[0:56:10] <Mako_Kreutzev> play half life 2 vanilla, it works FINE
[0:56:16] <KaiserMario> Woolie, why are you wearing your wedding suit? Trying to break it in?
[0:56:29] <phantalime> HL2 is fine as is
[0:56:30] <dukenux> Is HL2 LP officialy confirmed?
[0:56:36] <%SirGO0SE> LUL kaiser
[0:56:39] <%RioGascar> RioGascar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Another month, and i really am thankful for your guys videos and lps. Really helping me in these times. Enjoy black mesa
[0:56:39] <StarlitStunner> stripGasp sbfpBoot Brother! @deviljhojho_
[0:56:43] <+BNPhone> him playing them is confirmed lps not confirmed
[0:56:47] <%andrei11dr> Xen used to be the totally shit, and look like shit for that matter
[0:56:49] <+DreyfussFrost> Before Half-Life 2, what about Blue Shift and Opposing Force? They're not direct sequels but still official expansions you could consider Half-Life 1: Episode 1 and 2. Neither is anywhere near as long as Black Mesa.
[0:56:51] <Nested_Dreams> But HL2 SMOD though
[0:57:02] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Xen is like 4 to 6 hours long. In the original game is like 1 hour.
[0:57:03] <cocobody> At this point I’m praying Woolie gets humbled in Dokapon. He’s had it too good for too long!
[0:57:32] <%andrei11dr> Also this Xen is way longer
[0:57:33] <brian_peppers1> Give me vanilla HL2 or give me death
[0:57:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DreyfussFrost IIRC everything about OpFor other than "black mesa is nuked" is like, "soft-noncanon/wont ever come up again ever"
[0:57:48] <unit24> Half-Life 2: Substance, the true experience
[0:57:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:57:51] <DatAsuna> it doesn't
[0:57:55] <derap41> Not as well as 1
[0:57:56] <+BNPhone> HL2 is fine as is
[0:57:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur Yeah, no trace of Race X now
[0:58:01] <pennykettle_> It holds up amazingly dont listen to the haters
[0:58:01] <Dave_VD> I cannot wait for dokapon
[0:58:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> It's about the same as this honestly
[0:58:04] <DatAsuna> it has some good moments but it's pretty oof
[0:58:05] <%Haarute> hl2 vanilla is good
[0:58:06] <%KnivesEve> hi yall
[0:58:07] <brian_peppers1> NONONONONONO dont do it Woolie
[0:58:07] <%Irridium> nah Half Life 2's fine
[0:58:08] <unit24> that is not what mmod is
[0:58:10] <Mako_Kreutzev> No, not at all as close as Black Mesa.
[0:58:11] <majima666> @unit24 mgs2 predicted the orange box. genuis kojambles
[0:58:12] <@akuda_bar> vanilla is fine
[0:58:13] <+BNPhone> not even close what who told you that
[0:58:13] <dukenux> It's fine. Some elements aged, but it's a pefectly functional shooter .
[0:58:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> HL2 plays like it's trying to show off it's physics engine, which by todays standards isn't that impressive.
[0:58:17] <%RioGascar> Half life 2 holds up perfectly fine
[0:58:18] <DatAsuna> I playedit for the first time in 2011 and it had aged badly then
[0:58:18] <Mysidian_Maestro> HL2 vanilla is perfectly fine. It holds up.
[0:58:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah Vinny played that
[0:58:21] <+Aeoneth> I just marathoned them all, HL2 is fine
[0:58:22] <Zayasu> half life 2 is kinda like black mesa though
[0:58:24] <+DreyfussFrost> Vanilla HL2 is fine.
[0:58:25] <%RioGascar> both visually, and design
[0:58:26] <Lewisisphat> half life 2 is still great
[0:58:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DreyfussFrost @GeneralSCPatton that being said, I do think its hilarious that Black Mesa is invaded by two completely different alien armies within 36 hours of each other
[0:58:35] <+logoth_> its painted on
[0:58:38] <%Exyoh> I mean, sure, it's old. But it holds up much better than goldsrc stuff
[0:58:45] <%aceleapc> people who say HL2 doesn't hold up fucking boggle my mind
[0:58:46] <%shirrif> shirrif subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:58:50] <major_gnuisance> Just replayed HL2 and it holds up very well.
[0:58:50] <dukenux> Let's just say there aren't mods like BM yet, that'd justify a complete overhaul
[0:58:51] <%ConLin_Arts_> I have never been much for Half-Life, love Portal 1 and 2 though!
[0:58:54] <Nano_osecond> HL2 is a pretty good tech demo
[0:58:57] <Zeemod155> Black Mesa looks better than HL2, but not by too much. Everything else holds up fine
[0:58:57] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:58:58] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah HL2 is still great.
[0:59:00] <dukenux> Kappa
[0:59:00] <iosephe> and dicks
[0:59:00] <MonstarGrrrl> :o
[0:59:00] <Explodincatz> it is
[0:59:01] <%Javaa01> MMOD is not a full remake like this is, it just redoes some animations and adjusts the combat flow, but unfortunately, the changes to the combat flow don't always sync up to the original encounter design
[0:59:01] <+CatastropheCorvid> Also penises!

[1:01:38] <CutCombo> Kreygasm
[1:01:40] <majima666> always wondered about the person who first discovered milk
[1:01:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> Ever seen a geoduck? It's just a dick.
[1:01:50] <nothuzad> bees dont fuck they bumble
[1:01:51] <+BNPhone> every go through the path of least resistance?
[1:01:53] <majima666> "yo, this cow fluid is fucking delicious"
[1:01:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> Welp! Time to start FF7R!
[1:01:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> "im gonna drink this tit liquid"
[1:01:54] <awalr> when do the birds get involved
[1:01:55] <Zannablu_ke> the birds and the beads
[1:01:58] <%natebud> Bees are into some weird stuff
[1:02:01] <+thackattack00> I've never understood that, why birds and bees?
[1:02:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> @majima666 if it's good enough for the calf, it's good enough for me!"
[1:02:04] <%andrei11dr> I mean have you seen jellyfish sex? it's pretty interesting Kappa
[1:02:06] <razieltano123> Wrong way.
[1:02:21] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you looped around
[1:02:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> I once saw camels fucking in the middle of the night.
[1:02:27] <heartlesshealer> There was no circle, you just U-turned
[1:02:33] <KaiserMario> @zannablooke Someone remembers Rich Evans
[1:02:35] <dukenux> You ever seen SNAILS having sex. cause i did. it's like something out of Xen, man
[1:02:37] <+DreyfussFrost> @thackattack00 It's a way to talk about sex without talking about the organs.
[1:02:44] <Mako_Kreutzev> U
[1:02:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fact:The first person to drink cow milk was VERY VERY thirsty
[1:02:50] <+thackattack00> yeah I get that but why birds and bees specifically
[1:02:57] <Mako_Kreutzev> @doc_ock_rokc or very horny
[1:02:59] <FallenVerto81> Yeah """"thirsty""""
[1:03:06] <+thackattack00> why not bees and flowers, that actually makes some amount of sense
[1:03:13] <+BNPhone> !! CANON AT RISK !!
[1:03:17] <unit24> this is a repeat of dark souls II
[1:03:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @doc_ock_rokc Was probably a widower trying to feed his baby
[1:03:32] <+Aeoneth> He three Ammo at you, he was helping
[1:03:40] <+DreyfussFrost> @thackattack00 They're alliterative? I don't know. It's not like the birds and bees are doing it with each other.
[1:03:44] <dukenux> wow, look at this Pandora
[1:03:47] <nothuzad> so is this LP gonna end with Kleiner Rap?
[1:03:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @xx123manxx eh is anything in this game "not canon" explicitly
[1:03:56] <%Javaa01> Nah, it's just tumors
[1:04:04] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[1:04:06] <dukenux> LUL
[1:04:12] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[1:04:18] <%natebud> Xen's level design doesn't have branching paths that just leads to loot. Every path is progress from here on out.
[1:04:20] <%andrei11dr> Dont forget those bedbugs that pierce other bedbugs with their penises to create female's
[1:04:21] <dukenux> Yeah, let Woolie handle the directions Kappa
[1:04:32] <+DreyfussFrost> @liquiddinosaur The entire thing. It's a reimagining but I'm sure HL1 is still canon.
[1:04:39] <+BNPhone> i feel like exploding houndeyes are far from canon @LiquidDinosaur
[1:04:43] <+BNPhone> thats video game shit
[1:04:53] <astrofalcon1> kekW
[1:04:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[1:04:55] <astrofalcon1> KEKW
[1:05:07] <%natebud> That is one of those alien turret nodels from before
[1:05:15] <dukenux> Oh you can't kill yourself anymore by jumping?
[1:05:18] <dukenux> excellent
[1:05:19] <awalr> more games should have a "zoom the fuck in" button
[1:05:22] <Mako_Kreutzev> moobot isn't updated with new schedule
[1:05:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> I got 20k channel points I dont know what to do with. Do these things do anything for the streamer anyway?
[1:05:31] <Mako_Kreutzev> they never did
[1:05:45] <dukenux> are those snarks?
[1:05:46] <astrofalcon1> WutFace
[1:05:48] <heartlesshealer> Good job
[1:05:53] <+Rabbitmage> GET AWAY FROM ME
[1:06:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> you did it...
[1:06:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh god he's going to eat shit on that one hallway worse than i did
[1:06:18] <%Javaa01> Just jump good
[1:06:19] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:06:21] <%natebud> The answer cleary is to blow yourself up
[1:06:24] <arvidonfire> Try again
[1:06:27] <heartlesshealer> stop killing your momentum
[1:06:28] <+Rabbitmage> Use your grapple beam, Samus
[1:06:30] <+BNPhone> just do gooder
[1:06:37] <razieltano123> Do it again
[1:06:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @legacy0117 a Yui Ikari cosplay
[1:06:42] <%Javaa01> Just don't botch the jump and you'll make it
[1:06:51] <+BNPhone> if only you had a rope to traverse large pits with
[1:07:11] <chickenhunter> sprint
[1:07:16] <%Javaa01> Maybe don't jump at the wall
[1:07:18] <+BNPhone> he has auto sprint on
[1:07:19] <%natebud> possibly
[1:07:23] <%The_Timo> possibly? lol
[1:07:25] <+tuchpi> just run jump 4Head
[1:07:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> perhaps
[1:07:35] <Kraahka> This is why he needs a keyboard
[1:07:36] <unit24> woolie stop waiting to hit jump again
[1:07:38] <trianglehat> doesn't the jumppack propel you in the direction you aim?
[1:07:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> JUMP SOONER AND FASTER
[1:07:54] <heartlesshealer> never pause mid-air
[1:07:55] <%andrei11dr> Too bad you can't double jump like Doomguy
[1:08:09] <%Mr_Pylon> Keep holding forward while jumping
[1:08:10] <+BNPhone> you might have to manually hold crouch here
[1:08:14] <+BNPhone> nvm
[1:08:16] <TheMorilo> That neutral jump into boost gets me every time
[1:08:18] <arvidonfire> YAY
[1:08:19] <trianglehat> Clap
[1:08:21] <+tuchpi> @andrei11dr imagine if Gordon had to wallclimb and shit LUL
[1:08:24] <%Exyoh> Look, Gordon!
[1:08:29] <+agumon9000> A rope!
[1:08:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> woolieYE
[1:08:36] <+DreyfussFrost> So what was the boost input changed to?
[1:08:36] <trianglehat> rope boi
[1:08:39] <heartlesshealer> touched gun????
[1:08:46] <+Testfall_V> They can help us traverse large pits!
[1:08:46] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You WILL need to do that trick in the future. No joke.
[1:08:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Its a shame that using the carabiner ropes doesnt fit with gameplay, or it would be a good trap for barnacles
[1:09:06] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, you need to be able to make max distance long jumps during combat
[1:09:10] <+BNPhone> long jump is double jump now
[1:09:11] <%Javaa01> So yeah, git gud now
[1:09:31] <arvidonfire> Remember, rapid shots don't home
[1:09:33] <%natebud> How can a heat seaking weapon be so inaccurate
[1:09:39] <%Javaa01> Because once shit hits the fan, a bad jump is immediate death
[1:09:44] <%andrei11dr> @tuchpi Imagine Gordon snacking these poor aliens with a huge ass demon sword LUL
[1:10:14] <%Exyoh> The hornet gun carries
[1:10:22] <+gustavozxd> oh so he might finish it todayt?
[1:10:23] <+BNPhone> bugbait will never be snarks NotLikeThis
[1:10:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @legacy0117 yeah and in Freeman's Mind he never picks it up. People asked why. the creator said "Would YOU Stick your hand up a bee-shooting alien's anus?"
[1:10:42] <brian_peppers1> Hes not finishing this today no way....
[1:10:50] <%natebud> At least bugbait isn't plotting to kill you.
[1:10:51] <%Exyoh> I miss the gluon most of all in HL2
[1:10:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @xx123manxx yes because bugbait is cool and snarks suck
[1:11:05] <+BNPhone> i mean snarks do suck but they cute af
[1:11:14] <Kraahka> When will woolie turn off fast weapon switch now that he has a mouse
[1:11:17] <awalr> my favorite gun is the crowbar
[1:11:17] <$StaceMcGate> I still think Xen is bad despite being extended. It gets really old after 8-9 hours
[1:11:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Exyoh yeah but this game has the gluon gun equivalent of the Dark Matter Gravity Gun
[1:11:44] <+chvmpchange> these new wall textures give me zelda forest temple vibes
[1:11:49] <dukenux> yeah im afraid new Xen might overstay its elcome
[1:11:50] <%natebud> The best things snarks ever did in the original was clear a minefield.
[1:11:56] <maplemillk> Well shit Xen is the size of a whole nother game
[1:11:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:57] <+BNPhone> oh it does @dukenux
[1:12:02] <heartlesshealer> well that's one way to use the barnacles. As platform confirmation
[1:12:14] <+Xalgar> Woolie is so immursed
[1:12:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> i think if they just trimmed down the Gonarch stuff it would be fine
[1:12:21] <+chvmpchange> in regards to xen I mean theres only so much a fresh coat of paint can do for these levels
[1:12:22] <%aceleapc> @StaceMcGate you're playing it wrong if it took you 8-9 hours. it's maybe 5 hours at most
[1:12:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> but yeah as it is i think the problem is its overcooked
[1:12:29] <$StaceMcGate> like the factory goes on forever sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[1:12:31] <+BNPhone> BM Xen is good until interloper happens
[1:12:32] <+DreyfussFrost> Snarks are great, you guys just didn't use them right. They're just free damage.
[1:12:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> these levels had too much time in the oven
[1:12:34] <brian_peppers1> Can't wait to see how Woolie tackles the chase sequence
[1:12:39] <+Xalgar> EEL
[1:12:39] <arvidonfire> So. Would you?
[1:12:47] <dukenux> Heeling Alien Juice
[1:12:47] <+gustavozxd> damn this wasn't in the original
[1:12:51] <$StaceMcGate> @aceleapc streams I've seen are about 8-9 hours
[1:12:56] <+Dimfish> can we not talk about shit that hasnt happened yet
[1:13:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Freeman is getting high off alien juices
[1:13:04] <dukenux> healing pools were in the original
[1:13:20] <%natebud> The one thing Xen explicitly never had: trees
[1:13:20] <major_gnuisance> The healing ponds were in the original but were super discrete and infuriatingly slow
[1:13:24] <heartlesshealer> a crab man
[1:13:25] <+Rabbitmage> RULES OF NATURE
[1:13:27] <%andrei11dr> Good thing those aliens made sure to keep that healing shit around LUL
[1:13:27] <dukenux> FAX
[1:13:27] <maplemillk> Healing Pools are cool but I'm waiting for Drowning Pools
[1:13:28] <+gustavozxd> @StaceMcGate JUST xen? wtf that's the whole HL1 game
[1:13:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @gustavozxd other than the most basic bulletpoints EVERYTHING is new. Like yes this area ends "inside of a round island where you turn on 4 crystals to make a portal to the gonarch" but other than that ......
[1:13:34] <unit24> I genuinely have no clue how it could take that long to finish xen
[1:13:48] <+Rabbitmage> Its Iron Man
[1:13:51] <$StaceMcGate> @gustavozxd Xen is about half the games length now
[1:13:54] <brian_peppers1> he got spit on
[1:13:59] <Twichty> stronk
[1:14:03] <arvidonfire> I fucking adore the HEV Zombies
[1:14:10] <%andrei11dr> He's doing a dance
[1:14:15] <%RioGascar> So thats where the flash light is on the hev
[1:14:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> HEVy boys
[1:14:17] <%Haarute> he has the same suit that allowed you to kill quadruple digit soldiers woolie
[1:14:18] <%RioGascar> The chest
[1:14:18] <%aceleapc> gonna be honest you much be watching some BAD streamers cause 8-9 hours for xen is just absurd
[1:14:18] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s just vibing
[1:14:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEVY BOIS
[1:14:19] <%Javaa01> Nah, they have massive damage resistance to the body, because of the HEV suit, it's the reason you've lived through an entire army
[1:14:20] <TheMorilo> Fuck this part
[1:14:22] <+gustavozxd> why crowbar

[1:35:01] <%natebud> Woolie has dedicated his life to killing every barnacle, no matter how long it takes
[1:35:01] <+Ether101_Prime> @thesw1tch That's the reason I asked, because its an odd ability to have if they didn't have something to use.
[1:35:03] <+BNPhone> woolie always thinks the ones not in his way are in his way
[1:35:04] <major_gnuisance> @heartlesshealer New headcanon: barnacles are just the stalactite variant of grabboids.
[1:35:12] <Lieutenant_America> The entire Tree of Life?

[1:37:39] <%Exyoh> Until playtesting, HL1 houndeyes weren't all hostile
[1:37:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Could you imagine getting barnacled on the arm, and somehow managing to plant your feet on the ceiling so you can play tug-of-war with your arm?
[1:37:45] <+Slimshazbot> Non-predatory doesn't inherently mean non-aggressive
[1:37:50] <%Exyoh> They're just animals getting agitated
[1:37:52] <Lieutenant_America> In the Earth chapters they often don't attack unless you get close. In Xen it's on sight.
[1:37:58] <Lieutenant_America> Like in The Grey
[1:38:01] <+Xalgar> LUL
[1:38:05] <@akuda_bar> @GeneralSCPatton i think you would just lose your arm that way lol

[1:38:44] <%natebud> Woolie forgot about the shotgun
[1:38:49] <+Xalgar> Woolie is playing like its an N64 game, it's so crazy
[1:38:54] <anne_arkie> pup sniffers goes galactic
[1:39:06] <Lieutenant_America> The Houndeyes are a lot smarter in 1.0 than Early Access, but they do miss this one detail from HL1 where they recoil when shot.
[1:39:11] <MyNameIsRasus> @Balkespower Carol Baskins does not approve the Xen chapter in Black Mesa
[1:39:11] <+Balkespower> Woolie, the shotgun is your best friend in this part

[1:39:23] <+thesw1tch> woolie its a planet and youre just a dude bro. every planet is huge to humans
[1:39:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> @akuda_bar It's just a big upside-down "MASH A TO KEEP ARM" that you can't win, and ends with falling on your head.
[1:39:25] <Lieutenant_America> In Early Access they were nigh suicidal though
[1:39:28] <%Vorga1339> if it wasn't woolie I don't think I could make it through his grandpa tier movement
[1:39:30] <%andrei11dr> Well Woolie, planets are usually pretty big
[1:39:35] <%Vorga1339> but hey here we are
[1:39:38] <+Slimshazbot> Yeah the new interpretation of Xen is gorgeous and impressive, but I don't like how wildly different from the original version it is
[1:39:44] <+Dimfish> xen isnt really a planet so much as like an asteroid field in the middle of a gas cloud, like kind of just a mix of space material that life managed to cling to
[1:39:59] <Lieutenant_America> I prefer it to the original, but the art direction is very different
[1:40:01] <@akuda_bar> @GeneralSCPatton look gordon, ropes!
[1:40:09] <+RueOrin> @Dimfish Beat me too it. Nothing is really native to Xen.
[1:40:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:13] <+Balkespower> fuck these fishes
[1:40:13] <Lieutenant_America> In HL1 it was Scorn, straight up.

[1:40:17] <heartlesshealer> A finny friend
[1:40:17] <+Rabbitmage> redneck fishin
[1:40:18] <brian_peppers1> There is a reason they call Xen "The border world"
[1:40:28] <%natebud> shotgun at range, magnum up close NotLikeThis
[1:40:47] <Lieutenant_America> Still, some of that Giger flavor comes back in Interloper
[1:40:48] <+BNPhone> Xen in this game is just too fucking long
[1:40:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> THICC PUPPER
[1:40:49] <heartlesshealer> maybe save
[1:40:49] <+Balkespower> Woolie's mind is an enigma
[1:40:50] <dukenux> >like a champ
[1:41:07] <TheMorilo> Double shot is really tasty, I don't blame you
[1:41:08] <Kain5707> vineChamp
[1:41:24] <MattDemers> Piss tubes
[1:41:25] <+thesw1tch> @slimshazbot im not sure i like it either. i wish it kept the same layout of xen but added in all the extra detail so theres more to look at. maybe its because i just grew to blaze through it, but i dont remember ever thinking xen was that bad, just boring
[1:41:28] <atgithursdays> This is the first time I'm seeing the controller/mouse combo being used and wow it is painful
[1:41:30] <%Javaa01> Just jump back
[1:41:48] <ghostspartan80> it just works
[1:41:48] <+Slimshazbot> My gripe is more that the new design for Xen doesn't really match up to what Xen was supposed to be. Xen is a shitty barely inhabitable wasteland and the species that live here aren't supposed to be native to it. They're supposed to have ended up here and managed to survive, not thrive. Seeing a massive complex ecosystem like this seems odd.
[1:41:50] <%natebud> platform
[1:41:52] <heartlesshealer> port to port
[1:42:03] <+BNPhone> Yeah Xen in the original isn't "bad" it's just kinda bland @thesw1tch
[1:42:20] <+BNPhone> rekt
[1:42:22] <%natebud> Good thing those fish aren't a threat anymore
[1:42:22] <heartlesshealer> =)
[1:42:24] <+Rabbitmage> speedrun tactics
[1:42:32] <Lieutenant_America> I actually dig the general length of Xen here. As someone who came to Half Life late, it threw me for a loop how short the first two levels were, how nothing they are.
[1:42:45] <RetroPixel3000> "Gordon, what are you doing???"
[1:42:54] <heartlesshealer> save again
[1:42:54] <+thesw1tch> @slimshazbot true. xen was basically desolate cave systems in space and this planet here seems so healthy
[1:42:58] <+Dimfish> I like the xen redesign, I feel like an uninterrupted environmental dumping ground like xen would eventually evolve into a complex ecosystem given enough time
[1:43:12] <Lieutenant_America> Plus I enjoy how Xen the chapter is a bit of a breather compared to the last Earth chapters
[1:43:18] <TheMorilo> I love this version of Xen, specially how it gets darker as you get closer to Nihilant
[1:43:19] <+gustavozxd> did reggie ever play HL?
[1:43:22] <dukenux> the problem i have with this Xen so far, is that it lost some alienness to it
[1:43:30] <%andrei11dr> Woolie just loves that long range shotgun...
[1:43:34] <cocobody> Was woolie playing Overwatch like this?
[1:43:39] <%Javaa01> Yes
[1:43:39] <arvidonfire> Might fuck around and glitch later ahah
[1:43:42] <anne_arkie> I barely remember xen in the original at all...as an ecologist I'm a huge sucker for alien ecosystems and will absolutely read any and all lore about them in games
[1:43:44] <dukenux> though chances are things might start looking eldritch again as they progress
[1:43:45] <+BNPhone> long range shotty in this game is actually surprisingly good
[1:43:48] <+Dimfish> i honestly think it still looks alien, just alien in a metroid prime way and not in a half life way
[1:43:51] <+Xalgar> @dukenux Seems pretty alien to me as someone who didn't do original Xen
[1:43:57] <+gustavozxd> yeah this looks like a real world location transformed into alien shit
[1:43:57] <EDFscout> fuck around and glitch out
[1:44:09] <Lieutenant_America> It definitely gets more hostile looking after Xen the chapter
[1:44:17] <ghostspartan80> its pretty tho
[1:44:25] <dukenux> @Xalgar the og Xen didn't resemble any earthlike biom at all
[1:44:25] <bleugh> i don't really remember the original xen other than the few bosses you fight
[1:44:30] <%Javaa01> Just jump across
[1:44:30] <+Slimshazbot> THis looks alien like Pandora from Avatar looks alien. Which is to say it's like earth but glowy
[1:44:32] <heartlesshealer> ???
[1:44:37] <%Javaa01> This is just environmental detailing
[1:44:40] <%natebud> In the original the first Xen level was desolate space rock on the outside and the caves were the only place to find water and fauna.
[1:44:42] <dukenux> it was just bunch of rocks and weird.. growths floating in space
[1:44:59] <+Xalgar> So Xen was basically just World of Warcraft Outlands
[1:45:20] <heartlesshealer> amoeba :3
[1:45:23] <+Dimfish> i was going to say it reminds me of metroid because the asteroids are somewhat barren but the cave systems and canyons like what woolies in are full of life
[1:45:26] <%Haarute> no. REALLY tiny rocks floating in space.
[1:45:32] <+thesw1tch> hey can you still bunny hop in this version?
[1:45:34] <dukenux> D:
[1:45:35] <+Dimfish> which is what would make sense on a primordial world like xen
[1:45:36] <+BNPhone> WOOOOOW
[1:45:38] <%optimasmaximas> D:
[1:45:39] <phantalime> NOOO
[1:45:39] <+Rabbitmage> The original Xen was more Lovecraftian and abstract.
[1:45:41] <heartlesshealer> But they loved you!
[1:45:42] <ghostspartan80> wow
[1:45:42] <+cyrus1061> Hey woolie, does anybody archive your streams bud?
[1:45:44] <phantalime> monster
[1:45:44] <Meltgar> WOW
[1:45:45] <%optimasmaximas> COLONIST
[1:45:47] <arvidonfire> There's a... REASON... why the creatures here are on the run and ended up here.
[1:45:47] <+BNPhone> AND YOU STILL FUCKED UP
[1:45:47] <+cyrus1061> Id love to watch this but im at work lol
[1:45:48] <%Mr_Pylon> bad fuckin end, wow
[1:45:48] <OldManDeckardCain> karma
[1:45:51] <%natebud> But the difference is that the whole planet is full of life now. There's trees and plants everywhere
[1:45:51] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie hates nature comfirmed
[1:45:51] <%Javaa01> Nah, this doesn't have bunnyhopping nor ABH
[1:45:52] <EDFscout> NOT THE PROTOZOAS
[1:45:53] <+Dimfish> the original xen was a meat fart planet
[1:45:57] <%andrei11dr> I like this Xen, it reminds me of that one time i did acid
[1:45:59] <%doomerskeletor13> IMPERIALISM
[1:46:03] <ghostspartan80> do you feel like a hero yet?
[1:46:07] <derap41> Civilizing this place
[1:46:09] <fmc009> Wassup manga readers
[1:46:12] <maplemillk> woolie is American confirmed
[1:46:13] <atgithursdays> Y'all got spices?
[1:46:14] <+Xalgar> Original Xen looks like it didn't support life at all
[1:46:19] <Kraahka> He's crouched lol
[1:46:23] <+thesw1tch> @javaa01 ahh. honestly half the fun of the first halflife is all the crazy you can get it to do
[1:46:36] <unit24> oh my god that's why he's moving slowly
[1:46:41] <+Slimshazbot> Xen was supposed to be a collection of desolate barely-inhabitable floating debris in the spaces where dimensions intersect. A place where life ended up and struggled to survive. Not a cool alien rain forest. I think crowbar collective did some impressive work, but what Xen was supposed to be was totally lost in translation.
[1:46:43] <dukenux> @Rabbitmage yes. some of those formations were took straight from woodprints in lovecraft novels
[1:46:46] <+Rabbitmage> This Xen is prettier, but I think they threw away the abstract laws-of-the-unverse-dont-apply vibe that Valve intended
[1:46:46] <%andrei11dr> Original Xen was very Aliens
[1:46:49] <%Javaa01> Follow the blue
[1:46:57] <ALTRNico> dabadi dabada
[1:47:05] <+BNPhone> Yeah Black Mesa Xen is just fanfiction
[1:47:09] <%natebud> I don't like that Xen is somewhere I'd want to go on vacation
[1:47:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:47:14] <OldManDeckardCain> Woolie: "From today onwards, on our interdimensional census, Xen residents shall count as 3/5s copmared to earth residents"
[1:47:17] <Kraahka> Well, what it was supposed to be sucked so they fleshed out the xen wildlife some more
[1:47:18] <ALTRNico> LUL
[1:47:23] <dukenux> OG Xen was like that one weird movie where Christopher Walken floats naked through an alien spaceship
[1:47:27] <phantalime> Leaf
[1:47:29] <TheMorilo> There's a little leaf in front of it
[1:47:34] <%Javaa01> It's not tight, woolie just can't jump straight because of the stick
[1:47:37] <Kraahka> "just fanfiction"
[1:47:39] <EDFscout> Black mesa new leaf
[1:47:39] <dukenux> this is more James Cameron Avatar
[1:47:42] <+Xalgar> This is like watching my Dad play The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall
[1:47:46] <heartlesshealer> killed momentum
[1:47:46] <ghostspartan80> so basically it needs to look like a wasteland a bit
[1:47:48] <dukenux> "A FUCKING LEAF"
[1:47:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> Lets agree this Xen is better, and the original was a rushed garbage
[1:47:54] <%Mr_Pylon> gotta hold forward through the jump
[1:47:59] <+Slimshazbot> @dukenux Xen sucked because of time and budget constraints, not because it wasn't Pandora.
[1:48:03] <EDFscout> aye
[1:48:18] <+Slimshazbot> Better to play, weaker in concept IMO
[1:48:19] <+thesw1tch> @slimshazbot i agree. gman even talks about that he likes stuff like gordon who despite all odds manage to survive, so it makes sense xen would be a symbol of gordon himself. everything on xen was supposed to die
[1:48:19] <heartlesshealer> did it
[1:48:20] <awalr> this xen is a good metroid level
[1:48:21] <dukenux> @Slimshazbot im not saying that's why it sucked, or that this one sucks
[1:48:42] <dukenux> it's just... some things were improved. others were lost in translation
[1:48:45] <%Javaa01> Original Xen was fucking gray though
[1:48:49] <+Slimshazbot> Ah my bad
[1:48:51] <Kalinflip> It smell like bitch in here SwiftRage
[1:48:55] <%Javaa01> Looked like garbage with the low res texturing
[1:48:57] <Kalinflip> oh sorry that was me
[1:49:00] <Kalinflip> :(
[1:49:11] <+thesw1tch> @awalr this xen is a generic metroid level. its what games do when they want to be metroid

[1:49:29] <RunningNGunning> Original Xen was baby food poop green
[1:49:30] <heartlesshealer> At the bottom of every lily pad
[1:49:31] <unit24> these things freak me the fuck out
[1:49:36] <%aceleapc> reminder that original xen was rushed as hell and valve isn't even really happy with original xen
[1:49:36] <Yung_FckUp> he eating good

[1:49:48] <%Naho_Saenoki> Look, Gordon! A rope!
[1:49:54] <Kraahka> Yeah this new enemy is stupid why can't it be a desolate cave like the first one
[1:49:54] <LeaIsChill> Crowbar!
[1:49:54] <anne_arkie> I like seeing the aliens in a habitat they're more at home with, their behaviors and design seem super justified once you see what they're normally like
[1:49:56] <+Ether101_Prime> Wouldn't shooting a gun be an awful choice underwater?
[1:49:57] <ghostspartan80> tight
[1:49:57] <arvidonfire> As much shit it gets for being too long, the new Interloper has phenomenally good subtle storytelling.
[1:50:00] <+Xalgar> I like this Xen better because it looks like an envirement that would support a large range of alien life
[1:50:05] <brian_peppers1> Yet Woolie refuses to evolve and use a keyboard
[1:50:07] <maplemillk> The new xen was like the opposite. It took a long ass time to develop
[1:50:09] <+gustavozxd> @aceleapc it's always nice to know when devs are like "yeah that part everyone hates is bad sorry"
[1:50:11] <%Haarute> this xen is so good.
[1:50:15] <Dave_VD> life... uh.... found a way
[1:50:15] <MyNameIsRasus> How come there isn't an animal with that strat
[1:50:20] <Twichty> a knife
[1:50:21] <ALTRNico> crowbar
[1:50:23] <%natebud> Interloper is the best original Xen level, but that doesn't say much
[1:50:27] <heartlesshealer> MANY water friends
[1:50:29] <+Xalgar> Holy shit that's pretty
[1:50:35] <Twichty> head crabs
[1:50:35] <+thesw1tch> @xalgar thats the exact opposite of what xen was. nothing was supposed to survive here
[1:50:35] <ALTRNico> you can eat nature
[1:50:39] <%Javaa01> Woolie would fall off the edge of the world within 48 hours
[1:50:42] <+BNPhone> i hear headcrabs are quite tasty
[1:50:48] <%The_Timo> LOL As if you'd survive that long
[1:50:49] <LeaIsChill> I mean, some. Figure it out yourself
[1:50:49] <+Xalgar> @thesw1tch But they did so it makes no sense
[1:50:50] <dukenux> Headcrabs are edible afaik
[1:50:53] <Melchior_the_Wise> eat head crabs and shit
[1:50:58] <maplemillk> Mmm headcrab stew
[1:50:58] <+Ether101_Prime> Assuming any of these are not genecrafted.
[1:51:03] <ALTRNico> Woolie's gonna eat it raw
[1:51:05] <dukenux> LUL
[1:51:05] <%andrei11dr> This nature is not as bad as the military shooting you LUL
[1:51:09] <+Dimfish> its protein based, you can make it work
[1:51:11] <+Slimshazbot> @Xalgar The thing is though Xen wasn't supposed to be that. None of the aliens in Half Life came from Xen, in fact Xen has no native speicies.
[1:51:13] <TheMorilo> Single shot wasp on the water is the shit to kill fishies
[1:51:13] <arvidonfire> Edible to *redacted*
[1:51:15] <anne_arkie> anyone else always wanted to eat an eye hound?.... just me?
[1:51:15] <Twichty> u need to cook it
[1:51:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> Uma Delicia
[1:51:20] <%natebud> The new tone in Xen is completely off. It's supposed to be some wonderful magicaly place instead of an HR Giger hellhole
[1:51:23] <+Ether101_Prime> Why is he shooting into the water like that?
[1:51:27] <dukenux> "Im gonna pleasure myself with this wish"
[1:51:33] <dukenux> LUL
[1:51:39] <heartlesshealer> BEES <3
[1:51:41] <Twichty> swimming flies
[1:51:41] <dukenux> IT WORKED
[1:51:42] <%emeraldskrull> coward
[1:51:42] <maplemillk> What is able to be eaten? Woolie will figure it out
[1:51:43] <haisho> I don't remember the hivehand working underwater
[1:51:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie the bear catching those salmon
[1:51:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> Scum it out
[1:51:47] <ALTRNico> NOW EAT IT
[1:51:47] <Meltgar> DEAD
[1:51:48] <%emeraldskrull> sbfpBoot_BW
[1:51:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> HIVE HAND IS THE ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON!
[1:52:05] <TheMorilo> I love how it has infinite range
[1:52:07] <anne_arkie> Face the SWAAAARM
[1:52:09] <dukenux> Za Hivehando
[1:52:11] <+thesw1tch> @xalgar no it doesnt. xen was just a rock floating in space that shit passing by stuck to it. in the original it doesnt even look like xen has an atmosphere. this is cool, but it completely misses the point
[1:52:20] <heartlesshealer> Something laughed???
[1:52:55] <%natebud> They set up this whole platforming level, but the fish are too dumb and weak to be a threat
[1:52:57] <MyNameIsRasus> So do I
[1:52:58] <ghostspartan80> xen has no chill
[1:53:00] <+BNPhone> just platform good and you ont gotta kil nuffin'
[1:53:09] <%ChoculaUltra> xen kinda do be like that tho
[1:53:18] <LeaIsChill> Just jumping it is also an option but infinite ammo jusst works
[1:53:23] <+xerotwo> PURTY MOUTH YOU GOT THERE
[1:53:26] <Twichty> Frog sharks... Frarks
[1:53:27] <%Javaa01> Because you're blind
[1:53:28] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[1:53:29] <TheMorilo> LUL
[1:53:37] <tacticalshota> hello
[1:53:39] <MyNameIsRasus> @Twichty Shrogs
[1:53:59] <DukeBlack_> I am nobody's bitch
[1:54:01] <+Ether101_Prime> Does Black Mesa have visual upgrades for the other games?
[1:54:05] <+Xalgar> @thesw1tch But how do entire species live on a collection of asteroids with no flora or fauna? I get that it's supposed to be completely alien, but it was just a bunch of boring floating rocks and ugly textures to me
[1:54:07] <heartlesshealer> Puppos?
[1:54:11] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[1:54:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:15] <dukenux> now that's more like OG Xen
[1:54:17] <unit24> the idea that nothing is supposed to survive on xen is ridiculous because even the original version has water that heals you
[1:54:23] <+Rabbitmage> walked into the set of Aquaman
[1:54:26] <dukenux> this looks like a palace
[1:54:31] <%natebud> Xen Pagoda
[1:54:33] <%prime_name> Looks like Dinosaur Planet
[1:54:36] <+BNPhone> this is the only thing left that slightly resembles OG Xen
[1:54:37] <ghostspartan80> OG Xen looked like shit tbh
[1:54:38] <MyNameIsRasus> A single specific being
[1:54:38] <heartlesshealer> ???
[1:54:38] <%Mr_Pylon> Good Morrowind vibes
[1:54:40] <anne_arkie> get the singing squid lady from 5th element in here!!
[1:54:42] <heartlesshealer> telefrag?
[1:54:44] <+xerotwo> Looks like Balamb Garden from FF VIII
[1:54:45] <zamzoph> supplies!
[1:54:49] <haisho> supply drop LUL
[1:54:49] <dukenux> oh... does Black Mesa send you stuff?
[1:54:52] <EDFscout> They teleporting you supplies!
[1:54:52] <dukenux> yep
[1:54:54] <Twichty> ammo
[1:54:56] <%Haarute> they sent a capsule!
[1:54:57] <Zeemod155> are the scientists helping you from the other side?
[1:54:58] <TheMorilo> Supplies from your friends
[1:55:02] <%Javaa01> The Lambda team are sending gear through the teleporter
[1:55:05] <Twichty> ye
[1:55:06] <MyNameIsRasus> They sent a supply crate
[1:55:08] <%Haarute> oh that's rad
[1:55:08] <heartlesshealer> probably
[1:55:08] <dukenux> seems like it
[1:55:09] <%Mr_Pylon> oooh, supplydrop?
[1:55:13] <ghostspartan80> help from friend
[1:55:14] <heartlesshealer> Remember to save
[1:55:16] <chickenhunter> read the lid
[1:55:18] <zamzoph> Why couldn't they just teleport you to that spot in the first place? 🤔
[1:55:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> IS THAT A NOTE? ZOOM TO READ
[1:55:24] <unit24> Hey down there! Supplies!
[1:55:25] <%natebud> put it together
[1:55:26] <+thesw1tch> @xalgar there was some, very little some, fauna or algae like things, but every alien on xen seems carnivorous, so that should be your answer. also, that sweet healing pool
[1:55:26] <+tuchpi> note inside the lid?
[1:55:27] <+craftyraichu> Is that a note on the lid?
[1:55:29] <dukenux> NOTE
[1:55:30] <+Rabbitmage> I think this is an easter egg
[1:55:31] <chickenhunter> theres a note on the lid
[1:55:31] <Kraahka> What the hell do you people know about what xen was "supposed" to be. Did you consult with valve about what they wanted for a remake of a game they made 20 years ago and have since made sequels that expand on what xen wildlife looks like
[1:55:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> READ LID NOTE
[1:55:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe those geekwads arent so bad after all...
[1:55:39] <EDFscout> LID note!
[1:55:46] <%natebud> amazing
[1:55:52] <zamzoph> I don't think you need to headcannon
[1:55:55] <+Shadowtalon77> the nerds are finally being useful
[1:55:56] <anne_arkie> I think xenobiology is near and this makes me happy R)
[1:55:56] <%andrei11dr> You're homies are teleporting you supply's
[1:56:05] <+Xalgar> @thesw1tch Yeah but Carnivores can't just sustain themselves on other carnivores
[1:56:07] <+Rabbitmage> NERDS
[1:56:07] <+xerotwo> TRUE WORDS PogChamp
[1:56:08] <heartlesshealer> Exploding with glowsticks is a good way to get people to see the supply drop
[1:56:11] <dukenux> noice
[1:56:13] <pshuuu> and then she radiated herself
[1:56:14] <+Dimfish> lambda sign!
[1:56:14] <+xerotwo> TRUTH
[1:56:16] <anne_arkie> I love that detail!!!!
[1:56:17] <derap41> Worked well for her
[1:56:21] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:56:23] <TheMorilo> man that detail
[1:56:24] <+Dimfish> then she got cancer
[1:56:24] <%Haarute> crowbar collective fucking saved xen
[1:56:25] <+Xalgar> @thesw1tch Balance of nature kind of thing
[1:56:27] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:56:28] <ghostspartan80> then she got irradiated like a hero
[1:56:36] <gunsrlove> Nah man...Wasps, botflies, centipedes are FUCKING SCARY
[1:56:37] <Zeemod155> WutFace nerds do good!
[1:56:39] <+thesw1tch> @kraahka bro, its been 20 years and this is one of the most influential games. they talked about it
[1:56:40] <heartlesshealer> get the bees
[1:56:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Maybe fear radiation tho
[1:57:06] <%andrei11dr> Don't think about why they didn't just teleport you here if they can teleport the supplys
[1:57:08] <%Javaa01> Woolie, it's dead
[1:57:11] <+Testfall_V> in the end they're just sending you that message, because Woolie is murdering a bloody path through Zen
[1:57:12] <%natebud> Woolie no, there's hundreds of those things in this next room.
[1:57:26] <EDFscout> oh boi
[1:57:26] <anne_arkie> Crosshair? We don't need any of those around here!!
[1:57:53] <+beanthelogan> @andrei11dr If I had to guess, they're able to track Freeman but not where he's suppose to go
[1:57:55] <+thesw1tch> @xalgar yeah, but xen wasnt supposed to have a balance of nature like this one does. everything was supposed to die there, so there was meant to be a balance like any other asteroid
[1:58:14] <heartlesshealer> Bees do not explosw
[1:58:17] <anne_arkie> OOOOOEEE that got me
[1:58:29] <+Rabbitmage> feed em

[1:58:36] <Mako_Kreutzev> Women want me
[1:58:39] <+Xalgar> @thesw1tch Yeah, but I imagine they've been there for several hundreds if not thousands of years for a portal to Earth opened
[1:58:40] <heartlesshealer> Wow bees are the most important resource here
[1:58:45] <Parapattern> Is there anything scarier than a huge fish in a video game?

[2:15:06] <RunningNGunning> Time for the most repetitive puzzle in the entire game
[2:15:07] <%doomerskeletor13> INSIDE JOB breebuPog
[2:15:29] <%natebud> that's dumb
[2:15:33] <ghostspartan80> you have eyes on the inside
[2:15:36] <TheMorilo> F
[2:15:38] <heartlesshealer> death pit
[2:15:39] <%andrei11dr> Hmmm ,HL2 might have a problem with this LUL
[2:15:43] <%Javaa01> Don't fall in the hole
[2:15:43] <+Balkespower> F
[2:15:44] <+Slimshazbot> lol wat
[2:15:44] <anne_arkie> kaCRUNH
[2:15:44] <KeystoneA2> never saw that happen lol
[2:15:44] <SheefEatsBeef> lmaooo
[2:15:44] <+Reveresao> across
[2:15:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:15:46] <Twichty> dont touch the sunkist crystals
[2:15:48] <MyNameIsRasus> WHAT
[2:15:48] <oyyzzo> LOL
[2:15:49] <nothuzad> :D
[2:15:49] <KuroStardust> that didnt look right
[2:15:50] <heartlesshealer> do not jump into the death pit
[2:15:51] <Lieutenant_America> It's the Direct Intervention puzzle
[2:15:51] <+Dimfish> remember how the sample you used to start the resonance cascade at the start of the game was a yellow crystal?
[2:15:56] <alrobot2014> that did not look quite right
[2:15:56] <Lieutenant_America> Also I've never seen that happen
[2:15:57] <%Javaa01> Don't lick the sunny d crystals
[2:15:59] <+Reveresao> jumo across
[2:15:59] <arvidonfire> Jump straight ahead
[2:16:02] <haisho> the hole is a gravitational anomaly do NOT fall in
[2:16:15] <arvidonfire> boom
[2:16:15] <+Buzzkill983> Resonance cascade crystals
[2:16:16] <+Rabbitmage> orange conquered
[2:16:16] <ghostspartan80> long jump away from the death crystals
[2:16:27] <arvidonfire> A Y Y L I E N
[2:16:30] <%andrei11dr> Reminds me of those Outter Wilds pits
[2:16:35] <MyNameIsRasus> This chapter got some good escalation
[2:16:36] <heartlesshealer> door?
[2:16:37] <Lieutenant_America> Only humans could invent elevators
[2:16:37] <+YabbaTroll> wait this aint combine tech is it?
[2:16:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> not canon?
[2:16:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Kappa
[2:16:45] <+BNPhone> no @YabbaTroll
[2:16:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> das an aayyyyylien
[2:16:46] <heartlesshealer> blue door???
[2:16:50] <+BNPhone> also not canon
[2:16:50] <anne_arkie> isn't that basically just what Black Mesa did?
[2:16:52] <+Rabbitmage> In Xen they use orange fanta as an energy source
[2:16:54] <brian_peppers1> This is not combine tech
[2:16:57] <+YabbaTroll> has similar aesthetic
[2:17:05] <MyNameIsRasus> I am willing to take full responsability for the events that transpired in the last 24 hours...
[2:17:06] <%natebud> There's like 30 minutes left in this level
[2:17:11] <heartlesshealer> woolie no
[2:17:12] <pissdegaulle> didnt the combine have them enslaved by that time?
[2:17:15] <Lieutenant_America> The aesthetic is a bit more curvy and swirly in Xen
[2:17:16] <+Reveresao> NotLikeThis Why woolie
[2:17:19] <heartlesshealer> you connected no power to no power
[2:17:22] <Lieutenant_America> Combine is pure straight lines and angles
[2:17:32] <%doomerskeletor13> “Gordon, you don’t understand, our interest in their feces was purely for the betterment of mankind”
[2:17:33] <+BNPhone> Combine Can't get to Xen yet
[2:17:33] <TheMorilo> Woolie has no idea how am arrow works
[2:17:39] <+Balkespower> Woolie will figure it out
[2:17:44] <%andrei11dr> Live anyone would be dumb enough to fuck with argent energy again Kappa
[2:17:45] <%Javaa01> Or just plug it into the thing
[2:17:47] <arvidonfire> ARROWS
[2:17:55] <haisho> Woolie will figure it out
[2:17:57] <pissdegaulle> so they're just a slave to Big Brain for now?
[2:17:57] <+gutlesscoward> ARROW'D
[2:18:10] <+YabbaTroll> Im seeing tons of straight lines and angles built on alien terrain
[2:18:11] <heartlesshealer> LINK CABLES WOOLIE
[2:18:19] <+Dimfish> use your brain power
[2:18:20] <+YabbaTroll> though some of those cables look more geigerish
[2:18:22] <+knightwolf291> you got this woolie
[2:18:23] <arvidonfire> :D

[2:18:44] <anne_arkie> wait isn't everything straight lines or angles?
[2:18:50] <heartlesshealer> it grabs onto the plug jealously to say it's done
[2:19:07] <%natebud> There's not much reasoning to it, just plug the thing in and the door open.
[2:19:08] <arvidonfire> green
[2:19:12] <+BNPhone> Green
[2:19:12] <brian_peppers1> PUSH THE BUTTON
[2:19:13] <+Balkespower> press the green light
[2:19:16] <%Javaa01> There's a button next to the crystals on the machine
[2:19:28] <SheefEatsBeef> cool
[2:19:30] <Twichty> 1 done
[2:19:32] <anne_arkie> Tau cannon energy?
[2:19:32] <heartlesshealer> You're fixing it
[2:19:34] <arvidonfire> 1/3
[2:19:37] <RaklarLS> well, they definitely made it prettier, it still looks like a chore though
[2:19:45] <brian_peppers1> They stole this idea from hl2ep1
[2:19:51] <+Dimfish> inverse kinematics isnt unique to human science woolie
[2:19:55] <+Balkespower> yup
[2:19:55] <heartlesshealer> !!
[2:19:57] <Lieutenant_America> Complex machinery- solely the domain of humanity
[2:19:59] <+Balkespower> EP1 flashbacks
[2:20:03] <%andrei11dr> Concentration meme?
[2:20:05] <arvidonfire> @brian_peppers1 yeah 100%
[2:20:06] <+BNPhone> metro crank flashlights
[2:20:07] <ghostspartan80> or maybe the humans just copied it maybe
[2:20:10] <anne_arkie> charged by his piss circulation
[2:20:10] <EDFscout> static wat
[2:20:12] <heartlesshealer> explody
[2:20:14] <+Reveresao> bomb
[2:20:14] <+Slimshazbot> It's powered by the piss that's automatically collected by your suit's catheter
[2:20:23] <Kraahka> You crank the handle and build up charge
[2:20:23] <%natebud> The devs have an obsession with making you find 3 switches in identical rooms.
[2:20:29] <+Dimfish> bug out bag
[2:20:40] <anne_arkie> @Slimshazbot glad to see a fellow genius in the chat
[2:20:47] <+Aeoneth> I've had my Bug OUt Bag for the last 3 years
[2:20:48] <+BNPhone> and a hand crank radio or some shit
[2:20:51] <haisho> powered by kinetic energy yeah
[2:20:52] <+Reveresao> jump back?
[2:20:52] <+Aeoneth> I have a wind up flashlight
[2:20:52] <%Vorga1339> @natebud rule of three becomes the most irritating thing taken too far, it made finishing darksiders 2 hell for me
[2:20:56] <heartlesshealer> I have one where you squeeze and it has a tiny friction thing like a bike light
[2:20:59] <heartlesshealer> got it at the zoo
[2:21:02] <%doomerskeletor13> I have a Go Bag
[2:21:03] <arvidonfire> Infinite flashlights are like birds
[2:21:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> this is basically the suit in Dune it stores your dehydrated shit in the thighs
[2:21:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Was it just bullshit?
[2:21:13] <+BNPhone> what happened to the water engine guy? he got suicided oh no
[2:21:18] <major_gnuisance> Inverse kinematics just means "figure out what movements need to happen to arrive at position X"
[2:21:20] <%BubbaRands> Can't fight big battery companies
[2:21:29] <anne_arkie> wait what about lightbulbs?
[2:21:32] <+therabbles> lost eternal light bulb tech NotLikeThis
[2:21:44] <EDFscout> @xx123manxx that was fake
[2:21:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> That lightbulb is dim as fuck though
[2:21:44] <Lieutenant_America> Thanks Edison
[2:21:46] <%doomerskeletor13> There was a legit light bulb Illuminati
[2:21:47] <gyabs> Most blatant and disgusting is Apple's planned obsolescence. They sell 1000 dollar devices
[2:21:47] <%Ya_Boi_AD> Ya_Boi_AD subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hello Gordon
[2:21:52] <+YabbaTroll> I dunno how true that one is
[2:21:54] <heartlesshealer> HITBOXES
[2:21:55] <KeystoneA2> hitboxes lol
[2:21:57] <%natebud> Never trust Black mesa hitboxes LUL
[2:21:57] <%Naho_Saenoki> Look, Gordon! A rope!
[2:22:01] <Meltgar> HITBOX
[2:22:02] <+arancet> it lasts that only cause its a shitty bulb with super thick filament that gives off poor light
[2:22:03] <ghostspartan80> the light bulb shadow conspiracy
[2:22:05] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @LiquidDinosaur
[2:22:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> The short answer is- filiments are brighter when they're thinner, but they also wear out quicker
[2:22:07] <Lieutenant_America> That's a new one for me
[2:22:09] <DatAsuna> I watched an entire movie about that but it was about a woman trying to sell a reusable mop
[2:22:15] <heartlesshealer> Environment hitboxes are fucked. Object hitboxes are true
[2:22:19] <anne_arkie> physics wasn't invented until 1967, lightbulbs lasted forever before then
[2:22:19] <nothuzad> I started believing in non-physics
[2:22:20] <haisho> it is the source engine after all
[2:22:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Physics is a lie Gordon
[2:22:28] <%Javaa01> Can't pull out crystals
[2:22:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> Remember when the eternal lightbulb showed up in the football satellite story
[2:22:36] <DatAsuna> also she shoots a shotgun in one scene that felt like it was purely for the trailer
[2:22:37] <%natebud> That happens everywhere. Sniping is a nightmare when you're outside. This is new to Black Mesa
[2:22:46] <major_gnuisance> Not with suck a weak pullout game
[2:22:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:48] <anne_arkie> @LiquidDinosaur FOOTBALL SATTELITE STORY IS THE BEST
[2:22:52] <DatAsuna> cause our fuckin' mop movie needs a gunshot
[2:22:58] <%natebud> Hitboxes were never a problem in HL2
[2:23:03] <anne_arkie> I think about that on a weekly basis
[2:23:03] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Dr. Gordon Freeman, theoretical physicist, loses faith in physics.
[2:23:24] <heartlesshealer> destroy
[2:23:25] <%Naho_Saenoki> Look, Gordon! A rope! We can use these to traverse large pits!
[2:23:30] <Lieutenant_America> Up
[2:23:36] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:23:38] <SheefEatsBeef> ouch
[2:23:41] <Lieutenant_America> SCIENCE
[2:23:42] <+therabbles> took a spike to the face
[2:23:43] <anne_arkie> its just like the church scene from Hot Fuzz
[2:23:45] <+Balkespower> good job
[2:23:46] <+Markmeltzer> Hope you liked having a face
[2:23:58] <%doomerskeletor13> My hypothesis is to start blasting
[2:23:59] <anne_arkie> outsmarted by a rock
[2:24:05] <Lieutenant_America> Imagine a Freeman's Mind in BM
[2:24:07] <+therabbles> Gordon didn't believe in the physics and just ate shit
[2:24:11] <+BNPhone> deer in stalactites
[2:24:16] <Lieutenant_America> No box-smashing room joke, though
[2:24:20] <arvidonfire> It's broken anyway - sparks
[2:24:32] <Professor_Rakor> Environmental hazards? Nah. It's not like we're in a suit that has that in it's name or anything.
[2:24:33] <major_gnuisance> @WaitHowDidIGetHere "Theoretical Physics was just a theory, anyway" -- Dr. Gordon Freeman
[2:24:38] <astrofalcon1> monkaW
[2:24:39] <%andrei11dr> You did get your head chopped off by that portal thing multiple times
[2:24:41] <anne_arkie> LUCK
[2:24:42] <heartlesshealer> 👏
[2:24:43] <arvidonfire> PLANNED
[2:24:46] <+BNPhone> EZ
[2:24:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> Gordon has a theoretical degree in physics.
[2:24:50] <SheefEatsBeef> intentional
[2:24:50] <astrofalcon1> GG
[2:24:51] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog
[2:24:56] <heartlesshealer> gotta work on momentum keeping
[2:25:07] <Twichty> is auto run on?
[2:25:10] <arvidonfire> damn
[2:25:12] <TheMorilo> LUL
[2:25:12] <astrofalcon1> ok that wasn't planned
[2:25:14] <%Javaa01> Stop letting go of the analogue stick
[2:25:14] <+therabbles> swing and a miss
[2:25:15] <heartlesshealer> killing momentum just before boost
[2:25:16] <+BNPhone> yea @Twichty
[2:25:18] <+greenfall> big wiff
[2:25:22] <arvidonfire> nice
[2:25:25] <%natebud> In Woolie's defense, the level geometry in Xen is bad for running jumps. You can see he keeps getting caught on edges
[2:25:25] <%Ya_Boi_AD> FIRST TRY
[2:25:38] <%Javaa01> Yes
[2:25:38] <KeystoneA2> You gotta keep walking when you long jump. Pausing right before will make your jump significantly shorter. #Source
[2:25:44] <arvidonfire> other place
[2:25:53] <astrofalcon1> nice
[2:25:59] <Twichty> differnt angle
[2:26:02] <heartlesshealer> !!!!
[2:26:07] <EDFscout> this is a good one
[2:26:07] <anne_arkie> CROWBAR TIME
[2:26:07] <arvidonfire> OH BOY
[2:26:10] <+BNPhone> ah shit here we go again
[2:26:11] <%doomerskeletor13> doodBait
[2:26:12] <anne_arkie> the perfect tool for this situation
[2:26:16] <TheMorilo> How long will this one take?
[2:26:18] <heartlesshealer> OH NO
[2:26:30] <heartlesshealer> You have to chain it to clear the way!
[2:26:35] <+Balkespower> you can jump on the explosive flowers just fine, Wollie
[2:26:38] <heartlesshealer> or not
[2:26:41] <heartlesshealer> cool
[2:26:49] <%Javaa01> Look at what the supplies are
[2:26:51] <heartlesshealer> uhhh
[2:26:54] <arvidonfire> BLOCCED
[2:26:57] <%natebud> This puzzle used to be in On A Rail
[2:26:57] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:26:59] <+therabbles> how lucky that they didn't teleport directly into a plant and explode it
[2:27:00] <ghostspartan80> I have a feeling game won't be beat this stream...
[2:27:01] <heartlesshealer> no
[2:27:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> i like this one
[2:27:03] <TheMorilo> Look at what the supplies are
[2:27:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHECK SUPPLIES
[2:27:05] <heartlesshealer> need to explod
[2:27:08] <heartlesshealer> or explore
[2:27:08] <arvidonfire> gotta explode it Kappa
[2:27:14] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud It's in On a Rail uncut
[2:27:14] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieWUT
[2:27:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> LOOK AT THE SUPPLIES
[2:27:22] <Twichty> hold it ... explore more
[2:27:28] <SheefEatsBeef> monkaS
[2:27:29] <+steelmorrigan> set off the chain recation ?

[2:27:32] <resloxxx> LUL
[2:27:32] <%Ya_Boi_AD> First try
[2:27:33] <%natebud> Woolie will never figure out to use the satchels
[2:27:33] <astrofalcon1> ok not that
[2:27:33] <%jepupu> look at the lines...

[2:27:43] <EDFscout> Hint weapons on the ground
[2:27:51] <major_gnuisance> If this is anything like HL:S, landing jumps is all about aiming well and then timing those air brakes.
[2:27:55] <heartlesshealer> what is double crystal corner?
[2:28:00] <Lieutenant_America> Welp
[2:28:01] <ghostspartan80> satchel charge it maybe
[2:28:03] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America That wasn't made by the devs right
[2:28:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> NOT NECESSARILY, WOOLIE
[2:28:06] <%andrei11dr> Look at those supplies
[2:28:14] <TheMorilo> Gotta look at the supplies
[2:28:18] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Technically it was
[2:28:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> LOOK AT WHAT THEY SENT IN SUPPLIES
[2:28:26] <astrofalcon1> oh well there you go
[2:28:30] <Lieutenant_America> The guy that made it was hired to finish Surface Tension
[2:28:32] <+aishman> Close the door
[2:28:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> Woolie, look at the supplies they TP"d over to you
[2:28:35] <+aishman> AND EXPLODE

[2:28:43] <arvidonfire> BLUE SHIELD
[2:28:43] <heartlesshealer> woolie
[2:28:44] <Lieutenant_America> And On a Rail Uncut is of equal production value to the rest of the game
[2:28:50] <+aishman> You now have a way to blow these fuckers up and be safe
[2:28:51] <astrofalcon1> look at the shield
[2:28:53] <%Haarute> brain
[2:28:54] <+aishman> USE THE SATCHELS
[2:28:54] <Lieutenant_America> I never play the game without it

[2:31:59] <astrofalcon1> i think physics are hard
[2:32:00] <ghostspartan80> probably you
[2:32:01] <TheMorilo> A lot of pressure in a small space
[2:32:03] <%rubbishbinge> it is no excellent
[2:32:06] <Man_F_Artwish> You wanna close it again yea
[2:32:07] <%rubbishbinge> not*
[2:32:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> LARGE EXPLOSION IN CONFINED SPACE IS DEATH FLAG
[2:32:08] <Lieutenant_America> There is also a mod that adds back the Surface Tension Tentacle, but it still needs to update for 1.0
[2:32:16] <%natebud> Stop saying Source, this is all the Black mesa devs
[2:32:20] <+Buzzkill983> Why not satchel from the other side of the room, near entrance
[2:32:33] <TheMorilo> It's the air pressure in an enclosed space
[2:32:34] <Lieutenant_America> It was the same thing in the Explosives Warehouse
[2:32:40] <ghostspartan80> killbox
[2:32:55] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America I missed that tentacle, Does the helicopter show up to fight it anymore?

[2:33:33] <%Javaa01> Gotta get the big shard
[2:33:34] <anne_arkie> pebble

[2:33:48] <astrofalcon1> that's the one
[2:33:49] <%andrei11dr> I guess it's just a stupid huge radius
[2:33:50] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Not in the base game. There's a mod that brings it and the Chopper back, but the creator needs to update it for 1.0
[2:33:58] <dukenux> the buttplug looking one
[2:34:00] <heartlesshealer> half solved
[2:34:04] <Lieutenant_America> Because 1.0 somehow moved the pipe entrace a foot to the left
[2:34:07] <Man_F_Artwish> Need some viagra for your shard
[2:34:08] <pissdegaulle> when i played BM, i was surprised by how long Xen was. How long is it compared to HL1?
[2:34:08] <dukenux> Half-Solved

[2:34:17] <heartlesshealer> I'm dying LUL
[2:34:22] <arvidonfire> BEEEW
[2:34:28] <dukenux> @Calern way longer from what i've heard
[2:34:29] <%natebud> @Calern Original first Xen level was 15 minutes long.
[2:34:30] <+therabbles> in Half Life 1 Xen was a couple of short levels
[2:34:31] <Lieutenant_America> I love the Tentacle. It shows just how FUCKED New Mexico is
[2:34:36] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:34:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> There was also a patch that made a single gas-masked HECU run into the portal room saying "GET BACK HERE YOU BITCH ORANGE FUCK" but its broken in final release

[2:34:45] <heartlesshealer> Quick Man

[2:36:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> Shepherd's mind is okay but it is vastly inferior to Freeman's Mind
[2:36:06] <Lieutenant_America> He really didn't need to
[2:36:08] <heartlesshealer> borks busted
[2:36:09] <+BNPhone> Oh I never watched the discount series so my B LUL
[2:36:09] <dukenux> WAIT no. He jumped in a DIFFERENT portla
[2:36:17] <%andrei11dr> Remember, Woolie hates dogs
[2:36:21] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur None of them ever quite matched Freeman's Mind
[2:36:22] <%natebud> same guy? @LiquidDinosaur
[2:36:22] <Iwashi94> save the frames kill the animals
[2:36:24] <arvidonfire> Would ya?
[2:36:25] <Professor_Rakor> That satchel has NO honor!
[2:36:26] <phantalime> no
[2:36:27] <+Dimfish> the answer is just no

[2:36:28] <Who_lio42> hell yeah

[2:36:37] <astrofalcon1> would you
[2:36:38] <+BNPhone> LUL
[2:36:38] <Lieutenant_America> Though Freeman's Mind 2 is starting to irritate me

[2:36:47] <%jiggy_snipe> Lawful Good

[2:36:59] <Twichty> depends on like what kinda gun , will it put it down clean?
[2:37:01] <anne_arkie> Woolie goes where no man has ever gone before, to kill the nearest dog-shaped organism he can find
[2:37:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @natebud no its another guy. Everyone thought Freeman's Mind Guy would include that soundclip into his video. He instead included a _different_ Shepherd's Mind quote as like a double-fakeout
[2:37:02] <arvidonfire> @Lieutenant_America How so?
[2:37:02] <awalr> depends on the pup
[2:37:09] <%andrei11dr> I'd rather have the Screw Attack, it's more useful
[2:37:22] <zamzoph> Woolie's jetpack
[2:37:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> RKO A GIRAFGE FOR A DAVE STATE
[2:37:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> save state
[2:37:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> Uhhh what kinda dog is it? I could snuff a chihuahua but if it's something cute like a st bernard idk
[2:37:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> RKO'ing a giraffe sounds like a bad time for everyone involved.
[2:37:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Tersalus several dozen men have gone here before they just all died horribly
[2:37:47] <heartlesshealer> save

[2:37:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Man, I've got the dumb fingers today
[2:38:02] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @GeneralSCPatton that was one of my favorite bits
[2:38:08] <arvidonfire> Only bad part about Freeman's Mind 2 is the episode length.
[2:38:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton Just one or unlimited saves?
[2:38:11] <Lieutenant_America> @AxelssonOnFire They're keeping up the joke where Gordon refuses to pay attention to the plot, then acts like something doesn't make sense when it would if you actually paid attention
[2:38:12] <EDFscout> it's free dave estate
[2:38:22] <Lieutenant_America> Which worked in Half Life 1 but doesn't gel in HL2
[2:38:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieS woolieT
[2:38:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieF woolieU
[2:38:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @CommanderSqueaks it's one per RKO
[2:38:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks One save state per giraffe
[2:38:33] <astrofalcon1> PogChamp
[2:38:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton Deal
[2:38:39] <+Slimshazbot> Man I can't wait till Freemans Mind 2 gets out of the airboat section
[2:38:40] <dukenux> Full Woolz
[2:38:42] <Lieutenant_America> In part because now Gordon is being an asshole to characters people actually lik
[2:38:45] <Lieutenant_America> *like
[2:38:46] <%andrei11dr> I saw a dood hit he's teacher with a stunner,it didn't work or end well...
[2:38:47] <tattleworm> you could looooooose it all but we'll go down fighting~
[2:38:52] <anne_arkie> also full of eyes and randomly exploding

[2:38:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's Woolie XCOM all over again.
[2:38:56] <heartlesshealer> not worth it
[2:38:56] <Lieutenant_America> Also it
[2:39:06] <%rubbishbinge> break its bones fairly quickly
[2:39:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CommanderSqueaks I just hope it finishes before Ross becomes the black mold monster from RE7
[2:39:09] <arvidonfire> GREATER GOOD
[2:39:09] <Twichty> now everytime u jump the shine spark says " puppy killer"
[2:39:10] <+Dimfish> thats not how that works woolie
[2:39:12] <%jiggy_snipe> it's euthanasia
[2:39:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie has been hanging around Little V too much.
[2:39:16] <%BubbaRands> "Here's the knife Reggie"
[2:39:19] <major_gnuisance> LIGHT NOW
[2:39:20] <dukenux> Mercy kill
[2:39:31] <Twichty> now it can talk?
[2:39:32] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Did you see the PS5 controller?
[2:39:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie moving them fucking goal posts
[2:39:34] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:39:37] <Lieutenant_America> Woolie in Kingsman would shoot the dog, then strangle it when the gun seemed to misfire
[2:39:39] <heartlesshealer> WHAT IF YO HAD TO RAISE THE PUP?
[2:39:40] <+tuchpi> it's not a BAFMODAD LUL
[2:39:40] <dukenux> LUL wtf Woolie
[2:39:42] <%mitchteck> Save state tho
[2:39:42] <+Slimshazbot> The pupper's like DUNE YOU WILL GET A SHINESPARK DO IT
[2:39:42] <+Dimfish> thats not a pupper anymore thats just a person
[2:39:46] <awalr> i only snuffed the pupper for the good of humanity
[2:39:49] <%rubbishbinge> "sleep tight pupper"
[2:39:53] <anne_arkie> "REallY, youre a bad person if you DO NT murder dogs"- Wollie "pupsnuffer" Fightinggames

[2:40:05] <+therabbles> Paladin Reggie
[2:40:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> I only poopoo farted the pupper for humanity
[2:40:11] <ghostspartan80> nice to see a normal ass person for once
[2:40:12] <%BinaryFireball> fucking animal crossing
[2:40:14] <Twichty> then u can bargain
[2:40:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus does Twerka Industries do Crush Videos?
[2:40:25] <+BNPhone> First Try
[2:40:31] <arvidonfire> Save scumming in Half-Life is 100% valid
[2:40:36] <%andrei11dr> Would you kill a hedgehog for all of FF7 Remake?
[2:40:40] <Lieutenant_America> Save scumming IS Half Life
[2:40:46] <+BNPhone> if ur not save scumming youre doing it wrong
[2:40:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I would totally RKO a giraffe for one Save State per giraffe tho, sorry.
[2:40:51] <heartlesshealer> full crystals but no power
[2:40:51] <%natebud> Woolie doesn't know the joys of quicksave because he's not using the keyboard
[2:40:54] <Lieutenant_America> Same applies to Max Payne
[2:41:09] <major_gnuisance> Was it first try or did Woolie load in erased time?
[2:41:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton If I die, does the save state automatically load or do I need to load it before death?
[2:41:16] <%optimasmaximas> PS5 CONTROLLER JUST REVEALED
[2:41:21] <arvidonfire> I bet that doesn't do anything important Kappa
[2:41:22] <dukenux> until you save scum half a second from dying
[2:41:38] <+Slimshazbot> So no man's sky just added Titanfall Titans
[2:41:45] <EDFscout> yup
[2:41:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> what if you quicksave RIGHT BEFORE cancer cells start growing in you but you dont know for a few months
[2:41:54] <+these_pockets> hey gamers how's it hanging
[2:41:56] <+BNPhone> That PS5 controller looks like a piece of shit
[2:42:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> i mean RIGHT AFTER*
[2:42:03] <+BNPhone> hat a fucking ouya tier controller
[2:42:08] <+Balkespower> take the cable with you
[2:42:09] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur That's a screwed playthrough
[2:42:15] <%natebud> @LiquidDinosaur quickload
[2:42:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @liquiddinosaur You know what's better than a quick save? An autosave. It autosaves right before any serious shit goes down.
[2:42:21] <%natebud> forever
[2:42:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> meant to say AFTER
[2:42:23] <Lieutenant_America> Like when I found out Leviathan was bugged 90 percent into ME3
[2:42:27] <heartlesshealer> so check door room
[2:42:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks You get a post-death screen in the void, looking at a screencap of your death, with the option.
[2:42:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> But that would make me freak out if an autosave icon suddenly popped up in my brain.
[2:42:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> For no reason
[2:42:51] <%andrei11dr> Oh ,PS5 controller huh ,let me see
[2:42:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> What if you know your life is following the beats of a fictional story but you dont know in advance what genre it is
[2:42:54] <%BinaryFireball> I forgot the duel wieliding is happening
[2:42:54] <heartlesshealer> wasn't there an alcove downstairs?
[2:42:57] <ghostspartan80> alien butt plugs
[2:42:59] <%BinaryFireball> dual
[2:43:02] <%natebud> I wonder what happens if you throw that switch off the island
[2:43:03] <heartlesshealer> nvm
[2:43:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton That works, so I'm basically working off RE:Zero rules?
[2:43:16] <EDFscout> VIBES
[2:43:21] <arvidonfire> Look at that Source
[2:43:21] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur "It's not an adventure story, is it, Mister Hayes?"
[2:43:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks I dunno lol
[2:43:35] <heartlesshealer> locked in the open position 👏👏
[2:43:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> I have no fuckng idea what the internal logic is behind this particular switch puzzle
[2:43:38] <+Reveresao> F
[2:43:39] <heartlesshealer> !!!!
[2:43:41] <%Javaa01> And you did the puzzle wrong
[2:43:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> i just fucked around till i got it right
[2:43:43] <heartlesshealer> arrows on puzzle
[2:43:47] <+Balkespower> switch the cables around
[2:43:51] <+Balkespower> ARROWS
[2:43:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:43:54] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur The length of the cords
[2:44:02] <heartlesshealer> sparking
[2:44:03] <%andrei11dr> Wow ,this controller looks kinda wack
[2:44:04] <TheMorilo> he broke the cable
[2:44:14] <Lieutenant_America> Oh wait it's this one
[2:44:16] <Man_F_Artwish> Wiggle wiggle
[2:44:20] <Lieutenant_America> Yeah this one is a bit odd
[2:44:22] <+Balkespower> use the long one on top
[2:44:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> yeah this one. I dont get it
[2:44:31] <EDFscout> Change cables
[2:44:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> i brute forced this one
[2:44:33] <Twichty> if it aint jigglin that means the power aint running
[2:44:38] <+Balkespower> long one top and left
[2:44:39] <Man_F_Artwish> Look at the broken
[2:44:44] <Lieutenant_America> I never had a problem with it per se, but I don't know how to actually explain it
[2:44:54] <TheMorilo> there's a long cable and a short one
[2:44:55] <alrobot2014> this one the cables are just anal abou which one can go in
[2:44:59] <anne_arkie> jiggle physics based electrical grid
[2:45:00] <%Javaa01> Plug the long cable into the power
[2:45:03] <Lieutenant_America> The cable lengths ARE a factor
[2:45:05] <+Balkespower> one is longer
[2:45:08] <+BNPhone> Look around gooder
[2:45:08] <heartlesshealer> length???
[2:45:13] <Stofil42> are we at xen yet
[2:45:14] <+Hafpret> there is another set of cables you need to get I played it yesterday
[2:45:18] <%natebud> You actually have to switch cords? That's dumb.
[2:45:21] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[2:45:31] <%Vorga1339> @WoolieVersus also take note of the arrows on the plugs boys
[2:45:33] <heartlesshealer> now arrow time
[2:45:36] <%Javaa01> Now you just gotta get the order right
[2:45:38] <+Balkespower> ARROWS
[2:45:40] <Twichty> thats was only 1
[2:45:40] <+Reveresao> NotLikeThis
[2:45:44] <arvidonfire> Now plug to left
[2:45:50] <%andrei11dr> Good thing that the suite is invulnerable to alien electricity
[2:45:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie Will Figure it Out
[2:45:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe
[2:45:59] <heartlesshealer> .......
[2:45:59] <%Vorga1339> @WoolieVersus power travels along the arrow path
[2:46:00] <heartlesshealer> woolie
[2:46:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> "PUZZLE BOYS"
[2:46:11] <haisho> first one pulls power, second bridges the busted wire
[2:46:12] <arvidonfire> This is the jankiest shit in the game
[2:46:18] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[2:46:27] <heartlesshealer> save?
[2:46:29] <%MaddyCaddy> It's you
[2:46:31] <arvidonfire> power go UP
[2:46:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie always figures it out
[2:46:34] <+gutlesscoward> how are you gentlemen
[2:46:36] <+DreyfussFrost> It's you!
[2:46:39] <%natebud> This is just trial and error bumbling disguised as a puzzle
[2:46:43] <+Balkespower> We did it!
[2:46:50] <+Balkespower> Woolie figured it out!
[2:46:53] <TheMorilo> On my game, the short cable didn't even reach the plugs.
[2:46:56] <Lieutenant_America> Disagree, but I also liked this puzzle in HL2 Ep 1
[2:46:56] <%andrei11dr> This puzzle took way too long
[2:46:56] <+Balkespower> with the help of Reggie
[2:46:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> most of the puzzles are fine but THIS One is bad
[2:46:59] <+BNPhone> Woolie the god gamer
[2:47:01] <Twichty> biw
[2:47:04] <major_gnuisance> Autosave system of the Gods: - 2 minutes' worth of 5-second-apart saves - 1 hour's worth of 1-minute-apart saves - hourly saves since the beginning of the game
[2:47:05] <%Javaa01> Just a clean jump across
[2:47:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @xx123manxx yes and like god he is FAKE
[2:47:13] <TheMorilo> LUL
[2:47:14] <+Balkespower> don't jump in yet
[2:47:14] <%Javaa01> That's not a clean jump across
[2:47:17] <heartlesshealer> jumped into the death
[2:47:38] <heartlesshealer> ledge?
[2:47:38] <%natebud> Their dedicated to Rule of Three pads this game a lot.
[2:47:41] <heartlesshealer> yay
[2:47:54] <+BNPhone> wish the rule of three could be rule of one
[2:48:19] <arvidonfire> no it's good
[2:48:38] <Twichty> nowthere u go
[2:48:39] <resloxxx> uhh
[2:48:39] <Lieutenant_America> Suddenly a Vort rushes out. "GET BACK HERE YOU ORANGE FUCK!"
[2:48:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> THat's actually kind of horrifying.
[2:48:48] <arvidonfire> to your left
[2:48:50] <%DensityD> long jump into it
[2:48:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't like that sound.

[2:49:05] <Lieutenant_America> Stable AND ominous
[2:49:09] <+BNPhone> GREEN GOOD
[2:49:21] <janus_the_captive> woolie proceeds to blow his code to the far corners of the net

[2:56:18] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I swear Woolie attracts these bugs like a magnet
[2:56:19] <%andrei11dr> THAT WAS LUCKY I GUESS
[2:56:20] <arvidonfire> Shoot the mama in the NUTS
[2:56:22] <+Balkespower> Take the supplies, Woolie!
[2:56:24] <Kraahka> HIs crouching is glitching the game
[2:56:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> after this Woolie has to try a Surf Map
[2:56:30] <KeystoneA2> L A R G E N U D G E
[2:56:31] <+Slimshazbot> Is he crouching?
[2:56:39] <heartlesshealer> bees?
[2:56:41] <unit24> honestly woolie is doing better at this than I expected
[2:56:41] <Lieutenant_America> I never even saw anyone skip the music trigger in FAF until him
[2:56:49] <major_gnuisance> @legacy0117 death by teabagging
[2:56:51] <TheMorilo> Supplies have rocket in them.
[2:56:51] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America This game is 10% bugs
[2:56:53] <Professor_Rakor> I think someone turned off friction.
[2:56:54] <%chiluzza> oh yes fight
[2:56:57] <Kraahka> Yeah I don't know why he's crouching like that
[2:56:57] <%DensityD> ROM
[2:56:59] <Lieutenant_America> Oh it's buggy
[2:57:02] <heartlesshealer> DUMP BEES
[2:57:03] <%chiluzza> mama headcrab
[2:57:05] <arvidonfire> hot
[2:57:12] <Lieutenant_America> But these are never-before-seen results
[2:57:12] <%Haarute> the auto crouch jump with toggle is messing him up a bit
[2:57:13] <nothuzad> fat asses scare reggie
[2:57:17] <SheefEatsBeef> SUPA HOT FIRE
[2:57:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> GONARCH GOT THE BIGGEST SAC
[2:57:21] <KeystoneA2> Remember the floating heal island
[2:57:24] <+BNPhone> stand up
[2:57:26] <%Vorga1339> @Kraahka because he turned crouch into a toggle and is probably accidentally hitting crouch
[2:57:27] <arvidonfire> Omnipositors? Kink.
[2:57:28] <+Balkespower> Rockets, baby!
[2:57:28] <%optimasmaximas> he spittin
[2:57:31] <psidefx> The biggest tea bag on strim
[2:57:32] <%natebud> This might be the first Hard fight in the game.
[2:57:33] <%DensityD> what @KeystoneA2
[2:57:33] <Lieutenant_America> There ARE more rockets
[2:57:36] <%andrei11dr> Maybe use the RPG
[2:57:37] <%DensityD> what he said
[2:57:38] <TheMorilo> stop crouching
[2:57:39] <heartlesshealer> Woolie was too healthy to realize it was a heal pond
[2:57:39] <Lieutenant_America> And a healing pool
[2:57:40] <%MaddyCaddy> They are
[2:57:42] <Twichty> yeah

[2:57:47] <%Javaa01> Yes, they're undeveloped headcrabs
[2:57:48] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @nothuzad Hopefully Liam’s willing to share his ass-shelter.

[2:58:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> i dont want to spend anymore channel points, someone remind him he has lots of rockets in the resupply pods
[2:58:11] <+Slimshazbot> This isn't the headcrab homeworld, a gonarch just ended up here.
[2:58:13] <anne_arkie> @jetjagger222 incredible.....I just put that together
[2:58:14] <+BNPhone> Gonad monarch = Gonarch
[2:58:15] <+Balkespower> Just keep using Rockets
[2:58:16] <dukenux> the Broodmother
[2:58:20] <%jepupu> That boss is like a huge headcrab
[2:58:25] <+Balkespower> take mroe rockets from the supplies
[2:58:25] <%Haarute> "AIM AT THE NUTSACK, GORDON!"
[2:58:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> MAMA....MAMA LUIGICRAB???
[2:58:29] <%Javaa01> So yeah, this is when the game will start actively combating Woolie's chosen control method
[2:58:30] <astrofalcon1> headcrab tank
[2:58:32] <+therabbles> Mama crab got a big nut
[2:58:36] <pissdegaulle> they made Xen so long there's easily like 3 sessions left
[2:58:36] <dukenux> Pro tip when fighting Gonarch: ATTACC THE SACC
[2:58:36] <Kraahka> Woolie those supply crates that teleported in are all full of rockets
[2:58:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> GONARCH AKA BALL-KING
[2:58:43] <Man_F_Artwish> It’s Barney in disguise
[2:58:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> Basically nothing on Xen is native to Xen. Xen is like the interdimensional drain trap everything gets caught in
[2:58:43] <Lieutenant_America> God imagine when Half Life VR AI gets to this part
[2:58:45] <+BNPhone> The true baby nut
[2:58:51] <psidefx> His ball window is just HUGE
[2:58:52] <heartlesshealer> throw bees
[2:58:52] <Twichty> yes the supplies
[2:58:55] <%DensityD> RED PODS ARE ROCKET PICKUPS
[2:58:57] <pissdegaulle> there's crates yes
[2:59:01] <akman14> Woolie is blind
[2:59:01] <%jiggy_snipe> they gave you supplies
[2:59:04] <+gutlesscoward> you have a rocket launcher
[2:59:04] <%DensityD> AND A FLOATING ISLAND OF HEALS
[2:59:05] <+tuchpi> hl vr ai ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:59:07] <%andrei11dr> RPG THAT BITCH WOOLIE !
[2:59:08] <dukenux> So i heard Gonarch fight it's a whole level in this
[2:59:08] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur Do we know for sure that the fauna at least isn't native. The sapient ones definitely aren't.
[2:59:09] <%Vorga1339> @WoolieVersus tell woolie to hit up those supply caches that he didn't take ammo from
[2:59:09] <%Javaa01> The marked red supply containers have rocket launcher ammo
[2:59:10] <ingman112> Don’t forget about the health pool in the island across the way, and the rockets in the pods
[2:59:11] <+beanthelogan> Dangly Bits
[2:59:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> she's literally swanging that thing right in you're face
[2:59:13] <heartlesshealer> WATER ISLAND
[2:59:16] <hologram_sam> that red pod that blew upbefore the start have suplies
[2:59:16] <Twichty> the supplies u couldnt pickup cause u were full on everything
[2:59:18] <pissdegaulle> that little island has one
[2:59:21] <+Slimshazbot> RED PODS = ROCKETS
[2:59:21] <anne_arkie> The wiki lists one of its attacks as a "white toxic liquid".... oh n o
[2:59:25] <major_gnuisance> Can you jump out of reach?
[2:59:32] <+BNPhone> yeah it's a bit dragged out @dukenux
[2:59:35] <%natebud> Woolie will be here a while.
[2:59:42] <%Javaa01> Now don't get zoned out
[2:59:47] <%andrei11dr> @tersalus You know it
[2:59:51] <%Irridium> zone 'em out
[2:59:53] <pissdegaulle> ....i didnt know hterre was a healing pool in that fight
[2:59:59] <heartlesshealer> The poison shot is a cloud, so be careful standing in the heals
[3:00:00] <Lieutenant_America> The music gave up on Woolie
[3:00:08] <%DensityD> STUN LOCK
[3:00:11] <%DensityD> with rockets
[3:00:15] <+BNPhone> not enough stupid tribal drums in this fight Kappa
[3:00:16] <+Balkespower> GOT IT!

[3:01:55] <+TheFabledAble> wait... technology being set up like that pretty much prooves that black mesa has been to this world before right?
[3:01:57] <%Javaa01> You'll fight for your resources
[3:02:24] <Lieutenant_America> Also even if you solve the fight nonlethally Nihilanth still goes "WHAT DID YOU DO"
[3:02:29] <%andrei11dr> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:02:31] <astrofalcon1> well that wa easy
[3:02:32] <unit24> no way woolie will finish xen today unless he goes super long
[3:02:35] <astrofalcon1> was*
[3:02:36] <+therabbles> people were aware of Xen before the game started
[3:02:40] <Man_F_Artwish> @thefabledable we knew that
[3:02:45] <+Slimshazbot> @TheFabledAble They have been. In the Original game you only saw a few dead HEV scientists along the way. In this game black mesa has set up research bases here. But that's not technically canon
[3:02:46] <pissdegaulle> Xen is long as shit
[3:02:55] <binku_muja_> Ohh, finally caught a livestream.
[3:02:56] <%andrei11dr> TABLE HAVE TURNED HUMAN
[3:02:58] <%natebud> not all just some
[3:03:01] <TheMorilo> Just like real life
[3:03:04] <VickytheCarWash> So no head?
[3:03:06] <pissdegaulle> there's easily 2-3 sessions left imo
[3:03:06] <%RioGascar> Xen will not be finished today I forgot multiple chapters in this shit
[3:03:12] <awalr> crabs are stored in the balls
[3:03:20] <major_gnuisance> @binku_muja_ there's a schedule on Woolie's Twitte
[3:03:22] <+TheFabledAble> @Slimshazbot but were the bases common knowledge?
[3:03:23] <Professor_Rakor> Nah, that's how they control you. They put nuts on your head for dominence.
[3:03:23] <king_trito> @awalr LUL
[3:03:23] <dukenux> yeah i remember you're asking how the final level headcrab looks like
[3:03:29] <%DensityD> saline solution price markup is crazy DansGame
[3:03:30] <+Slimshazbot> @TheFabledAble No
[3:03:34] <+TheFabledAble> k
[3:03:44] <arvidonfire> Yeah, I'd say 2-3 more sessions.
[3:03:50] <%RioGascar> No
[3:03:52] <+BNPhone> still have to the do long ass turd of a chapter interloper which is a whole ordeal
[3:03:55] <%RioGascar> 1 more session
[3:04:00] <%Javaa01> Gotta run past it
[3:04:04] <%natebud> Interloper is going to take forever.
[3:04:08] <%RioGascar> no way in hell is it gonna be 2 more sessions
[3:04:12] <binku_muja_> thanks @majorgnuisance I'll check it out!
[3:04:12] <%optimasmaximas> only woolie would stretch it out this match without meaning too LUL
[3:04:20] <arvidonfire> Interloper is L O N G
[3:04:29] <Lieutenant_America> It's long, but I really like Interloper
[3:04:35] <pissdegaulle> Xen is long dude, there's the gonarch sequence and the whole factory chapter to go
[3:04:37] <KeystoneA2> Gas
[3:04:38] <%natebud> Remember when Surface Tension was a whole stream? Interloper is longer
[3:04:40] <arvidonfire> Yes, ir's good
[3:04:41] <king_trito> 12 more sessions guys huggHOPE huggHOPE huggHOPE
[3:04:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah more like Inceloper
[3:04:44] <arvidonfire> it's*
[3:04:48] <awalr> balls deep
[3:04:48] <TheMorilo> Yeah, there's one more session. I hope it's this week
[3:04:52] <%andrei11dr> I think he'll finish it next session if he goes for a long stream
[3:05:00] <%RioGascar> nah this week is
[3:05:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:05:03] <Lieutenant_America> BM Interloper actually feels like a climax

[3:05:35] <Lieutenant_America> @xx123manxx Disagree, but not much to do about subjective opinion
[3:05:36] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @xx123manxx Is that the one where Gordon teleports to a seemingly normal American town, but all the residents point and shout, “Interloper!” at him?
[3:05:36] <+Balkespower> Shoot the gas leak
[3:05:36] <awalr> did woolie do a 180 at the fire
[3:05:45] <king_trito> Kappa
[3:05:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Reveresao wow its fucking nothing
[3:05:53] <+Rabbitmage> PS5 controller looks like its armored
[3:05:58] <+BNPhone> you got it spot on! @WaitHowDidIGetHere
[3:05:59] <arvidonfire> GAS GAS GAS
[3:06:00] <+Balkespower> Shoot the plant that spweing gas
[3:06:03] <EDFscout> fire
[3:06:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> also its white so it can get gros and dirty
[3:06:06] <+Balkespower> *spewing
[3:06:13] <Lieutenant_America> PS5 Controller is the elite mook variant of the PS4 controller
[3:06:17] <TheMorilo> ssssssss = gas
[3:06:17] <%natebud> Interloper is a wet level now. Feels like they were inspired by Agony
[3:06:27] <arvidonfire> Guess you're ready cause I'm waiting for you
[3:06:29] <TheMorilo> Crowbar the gas
[3:06:34] <dukenux> Spider-man?
[3:06:34] <arvidonfire> It's gonna be so EXCITING

[3:06:37] <%Javaa01> Gotta throw a flare
[3:06:39] <+BNPhone> lower
[3:06:40] <%natebud> just gasoline all over the ground
[3:06:44] <+BNPhone> shoot lower
[3:06:45] <heartlesshealer> burning

[3:06:56] <unit24> oh no\
[3:06:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> PISTOL SHOTS WORK FINE
[3:06:58] <arvidonfire> Didn't need bomb
[3:06:59] <unit24> woolie learned the wrong lesson
[3:07:06] <negawrecka> with GAAASOOOOLLIIINNEE!
[3:07:11] <binku_muja_> I love the weird cooing noises they keep making.
[3:07:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> guys spam that pistol shots or flares work fine so he doesnt keep using bombs
[3:07:17] <Mako_Kreutzev> woolie mislearned again ;_;
[3:07:22] <unit24> oh nooooo
[3:07:23] <%natebud> just shoot it
[3:07:27] <TheMorilo> Oh no he mislearned again
[3:07:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> PISTOL AND FLARES WILL IGNITE
[3:07:32] <Lieutenant_America> Pistol works, just aim at the coral thingy
[3:07:35] <+BNPhone> Just shoot it with a glock
[3:07:39] <%Javaa01> Just shoot the wavey gas with a pistol
[3:07:42] <+RueOrin> If only there were objects around that could light gas...
[3:07:42] <EDFscout> whew
[3:07:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> phew
[3:07:46] <TheMorilo> thank god for the bees
[3:07:50] <+Aeoneth> .... what?
[3:07:50] <+Rabbitmage> Gordon talked
[3:07:54] <Mako_Kreutzev> fire bees
[3:07:56] <%MaddyCaddy> Flammable bees
[3:07:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ignition bees
[3:08:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Rabbitmage the only time Gordon ever emits sound is when he's on fire
[3:08:07] <major_gnuisance> PS5 controller seems to be a DS4 with a refined design, enhanced haptic feedback and built-in mics. Am I missing anything?
[3:08:10] <%natebud> Oh yeah, wasn't there a boss fight in here somewhere?
[3:08:24] <+BNPhone> last thing a controller needs is a built in ic
[3:08:26] <Mako_Kreutzev> the clit vibe addon @majorgnuisance
[3:08:27] <+BNPhone> mic**
[3:08:37] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud This Vortal Coil did the same thing.
[3:08:50] <%natebud> who?
[3:08:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh also heavy breathing when he's being teleported
[3:08:58] <dukenux> PS5 controller like it's emulating xbox one
[3:08:59] <Lieutenant_America> You haven't played the Episodes?
[3:09:12] <major_gnuisance> @xx123manxx It's a mic array. Should enable fancy sound processing magic to isolate the player's voice.
[3:09:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> I hope it that controller they showed isnt the default colors. I need my thing all black everything
[3:09:37] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Did you not play Episode 2?
[3:09:38] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America oh was that in the mines in Ep 2?
[3:09:42] <TheMorilo> LUL
[3:09:46] <hamiltin463> Ps5 controller looks cool
[3:09:49] <Lieutenant_America> Yeah. Level long chase with the Antlion Guard
[3:09:53] <%natebud> It's been a while @Lieutenant_America
[3:09:53] <heartlesshealer> !!!
[3:09:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> I forget so much about episode 2
[3:09:57] <KeystoneA2> planned
[3:10:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Episode 1 is fine. I didnt like Episode 2 at all
[3:10:07] <%andrei11dr> SKILLZ
[3:10:10] <%SirGO0SE> woolieYE
[3:10:12] <%Irridium> PS5 controller looks to have a lot of neat features I will disable as fast as I possibly can
[3:10:22] <negawrecka> lytMOTIVATED
[3:10:23] <dukenux> Ep 2 had an achievement for squashing all the antlion grubs
[3:10:26] <Lieutenant_America> Odd, most takes I see prefer Ep 2
[3:10:27] <%Javaa01> Episode 2 is a lot better then Episode 1, but it's also a lot harder
[3:10:34] <dukenux> also, Ep2 antlions grossed me the fuck out
[3:10:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Irridium that's how I felt about the PS4 controller too
[3:10:39] <KeystoneA2> True Chads got the Gnome achievement.
[3:10:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> I also REFUSE to play the final strider battle
[3:10:46] <%natebud> I remember Ep 1 being weaker than 2, but I'll have to replay it. For some reason I like Blue Shift better than Opposing Force after just replaying it.
[3:10:47] <heartlesshealer> gonna have to bow out of the stream, good luck finishing Zen! You guys are doing great!
[3:10:48] <KeystoneA2> And the "Defend all buildings" at the end
[3:10:48] <%Javaa01> Because it expands the combat sandbox to be more then just zombies, headcrabs and combine
[3:10:51] <+BNPhone> first thing thats happening to my ps5 controller is the mic getting taken out/ destroyed
[3:10:51] <+Reverend_Roscoe> I don't want a share button or a trackpad or gyro or a speaker
[3:10:52] <binku_muja_> PogChamp
[3:10:57] <dukenux> Ep 2 is much better than 1
[3:11:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> that kind of combined finnicky control and time pressure is the kind of stress i hate, so i just blatantly cheated my ass off in that scene
[3:11:03] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah the Strider battle is kinda disappointing
[3:11:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> ...BOOO
[3:11:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> GONAD MONARCH
[3:11:11] <%Javaa01> Yes Woolie, that is the joke
[3:11:11] <Lieutenant_America> But the silo fight rocks
[3:11:15] <EDFscout> @KeystoneA2 trick is only few of them actually destroy buildings
[3:11:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That's the intention I think lol
[3:11:22] <Lieutenant_America> And all the driving stuff is great
[3:11:22] <%Javaa01> It is a giant gonad
[3:11:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Lieutenant_America literally turned off enemy AI and just fucking leisurely shot the magnusson device onto inert striders. I dont give a fuck.
[3:11:49] <major_gnuisance> Gyro aim is boss. Only thing that redeems a controller's ability to aim without making the game do half the work.
[3:11:56] <Lieutenant_America> I don't like the Magnusson Devices, but I also don't like that it's JUST Hunters and Striders
[3:11:58] <Kraahka> Strider battle was like my favorite part in hl2 ep 2
[3:12:14] <Lieutenant_America> I think it would've worked better if it was all enemy types
[3:12:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:12:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> im not going to drive a janky ass Source Car with fragile cargo up to a bunch of agile deadly enemies that mostly die to gravity gun shots or car-hits, but also deliberately target my precious cargo
[3:12:18] <+BNPhone> ep 2 has the least replayability IMO
[3:12:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @majorgnuisance Gyro aim in Majora's Mask 3D is tight as hell
[3:12:21] <%Vorga1339> @Lieutenant_America lmao
[3:12:34] <Lieutenant_America> @nawji >
[3:12:36] <Lieutenant_America> ?
[3:12:37] <%Javaa01> Or just, like, walk around it
[3:12:38] <KeystoneA2> I remember the early trailers that showed EP 2's ending had Striders, Hunters, and Elite troopers all at once. That would've been fun.
[3:12:52] <%natebud> You know what the difference is, in Ep2 I bet you didn't have the weapons to kill the antlion guard and that's why you were running away. Here you have all the weapons you need @Lieutenant_America
[3:12:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> like Hunters are OKAY if that's all your fighting, because they take a while to fight
[3:13:07] <dukenux> it did? i remember fighting Striders and Hunters at the end
[3:13:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> I see Woolie has embraced the Cube
[3:13:30] <astrofalcon1> PogChamp
[3:13:36] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Actually it's because you need the Guard alive to get the macguffin
[3:13:37] <EDFscout> with a big nut no less
[3:13:38] <awalr> mother i'd like to fight
[3:13:41] <%SirGO0SE> zoneGasm

[3:13:54] <+BNPhone> CILF Crabby I'f Love to Fight
[3:13:56] <Lieutenant_America> You literally need to keep it alive as it rams you
[3:14:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Woolie talking about YouTube right now?
[3:14:05] <major_gnuisance> @GeneralSCPatton Gyro aiming is the #1 thing that sold me on the Steam Controller, and also the #1 thing the STim ConTRallEr SuCcs crowd completely misses.
[3:14:06] <anne_arkie> a floral sundress hovering the gigantic nutsack
[3:14:11] <anne_arkie> *covering
[3:14:13] <%andrei11dr> Woolie loves he's ladies with big nutsacks
[3:14:14] <+BNPhone> F
[3:14:14] <Tucker0603> that just means you get mama and the daughters Kappa
[3:14:17] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America Oh yeah you're right.
[3:14:38] <%natebud> This feels like a big timesink though.
[3:14:43] <Lieutenant_America> Besides, I don't mind making the Gonarch into Nemesis for a level's length
[3:14:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh jesus
[3:15:01] <Lieutenant_America> That's the thing, I'm fine with the level lengths, mostly at least
[3:15:01] <+tuchpi> jermaDisgust
[3:15:03] <major_gnuisance> Big kudos to Nintendo for bringing gyro aim into the mainstream.

[3:15:09] <fairore> oh god WutFace
[3:15:12] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:15:18] <%natebud> They just needed a place to put those fire doors, which aren't that interesting to begin with.
[3:15:20] <astrofalcon1> larrLewd
[3:15:29] <%Javaa01> Woolie VS Ballbusting
[3:15:32] <Lieutenant_America> Okay yeah they could've toned down the fire doors
[3:15:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> "It's all about you girl, now hey I'mma need like $300"
[3:15:49] <%andrei11dr> Woolie has pregnant fetish? woolieS woolieT
[3:15:52] <Lieutenant_America> Also coming up are the ONLY BULLSQUIDS in Black Mesa that act like they're supposed to.
[3:16:02] <Lieutenant_America> For some reason they only function properly in one room
[3:16:02] <+BNPhone> how girl purgananant
[3:16:09] <KeystoneA2> This is where you got zapped to briefly during the Resonance Cascade way back at the start
[3:16:12] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America I don't believe you.
[3:16:14] <awalr> "you got any games in your hev suit"
[3:16:20] <Lieutenant_America> It's also the room you see in the beginning of the game
[3:16:25] <Lieutenant_America> During the Cascade
[3:16:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Thicc boys
[3:16:33] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Believe what?
[3:16:51] <%natebud> A working bullsquid enemy. But wow, they're slow now. I've never seen them run until now. @Lieutenant_America
[3:16:59] <Lieutenant_America> Exactly!
[3:17:19] <crossing_mao> !uptime
[3:17:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 31 minutes
[3:17:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> all the warriors
[3:17:26] <%Tearonex> the world exists to kill you now
[3:17:33] <Man_F_Artwish> I miss bull squids
[3:17:33] <Lieutenant_America> With 1.0 the AI for most of the enemies are fixed, but for some reason the Bullsquids are still bugged or something
[3:17:39] <+Rabbitmage> I wonder if the blue energy is where the scientists got their HEV technology from
[3:17:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> what do you mean bullsquid AI fucked
[3:17:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> how are they supposed to work
[3:17:49] <%DensityD> this is the best new Freeman's Mind
[3:17:53] <Lieutenant_America> Before this room I assumed it was a design choice, but WITH this room I think it was a bug like the Tentacles
[3:17:54] <%optimasmaximas> HIDE YOUR MOMS
[3:17:56] <%DensityD> woolieFUN
[3:17:58] <Camail> D:
[3:18:00] <+BNPhone> MURDERER
[3:18:04] <%jiggy_snipe> BIG MURDER
[3:18:11] <%natebud> @LiquidDinosaur They're supposed to chase you down, they were fast too.
[3:18:12] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur In HL1 Bullsquids charge you primarily
[3:18:13] <unit24> he came right at me
[3:18:13] <Camail> pour some crack on him
[3:18:13] <%andrei11dr> Yea Gordon, fuck that bug corpse! woolieYE
[3:18:16] <%SirGO0SE> D:
[3:18:18] <haisho> Not the Amoeboid BibleThump
[3:18:19] <EDFscout> never have i felt so much for a single cell
[3:18:20] <Man_F_Artwish> Gordon is snusk
[3:18:21] <major_gnuisance> @Rabbitmage The HEV recharging stations in BM seem to be powered by a glowing electric blue goo.
[3:18:21] <hologram_sam> "I killed a kid"
[3:18:26] <jetswerve> Kill is confirmed
[3:18:28] <+Aeoneth> Tell it to the judge
[3:18:39] <hologram_sam> "had a toy gun, lookeed real enough"
[3:18:42] <%natebud> And they shot the goo at you if you were running away in a straight line. @Lieutenant_America
[3:18:50] <%andrei11dr> "Kill is fucking confirmed"
[3:19:03] <psidefx> ^^
[3:19:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> we aint got nowhere to go
[3:19:05] <Tucker0603> @WoolieVersus so your fine with milfs with sacks, how you feeling about hyena girls with the psuedopenis Kappa
[3:19:07] <+BNPhone> these straight up chickens
[3:19:09] <+Taglog7> I'm just trying to smash in my durag
[3:19:18] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur Case in point: In Questionable Ethics some Bullsquids fight Marines. In HL1 they're booking it towards the Marines. In BM they just stand in one place and soak fire.
[3:19:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:19:24] <major_gnuisance> Those headcrab babbies look straight out of Binding of Isaac.
[3:19:36] <Lieutenant_America> Objective: Survive
[3:19:40] <%DensityD> wall is open now
[3:19:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Lieutenant_America in their defense they soak up A LOT of fire
[3:19:45] <+Rabbitmage> feed, my children
[3:19:46] <%natebud> I feel like the devs didn't really understand the function of a lot of Half Life enemies. I still can't get over that Vortigaunts miss now.
[3:19:49] <+BNPhone> look with your special eyes ... and maybe ears
[3:19:53] <hologram_sam> the plunger woolie
[3:19:54] <Camail> the plunger is on the ground
[3:19:54] <psidefx> @Taglog7 with the black air forces
[3:19:57] <+mythboy99> the wall is open now
[3:19:58] <+tuchpi> @majorgnuisance the Gonarch spit reminds me of isaac too
[3:20:04] <%DensityD> port
[3:20:08] <hologram_sam> the plunger is on the ground
[3:20:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @majorgnuisance a giant testicle-spider that births vagina-spiders is extremely BoI
[3:20:19] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud The vorts are fine now. Most of the enemies are fine now. It's just the Bullsquids that are still fucked
[3:20:41] <+Balkespower> RUN!
[3:20:46] <Camail> she likes it ROUGH
[3:20:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> are the vorts "supposed" to have infinite fucking range?
[3:20:48] <+Balkespower> now you are the hunted
[3:20:49] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:20:50] <Lieutenant_America> I don't think they didn't understand, I think it's just getting them to work properly
[3:20:50] <%KnivesEve> is that a head crab queen
[3:20:52] <%andrei11dr> LUL
[3:20:57] <+huggablemantooth> HAHAHA
[3:20:58] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:21:01] <DukeBlack_> gwdHap
[3:21:01] <Rei_Dsoto> Not bad sining.
[3:21:03] <KeystoneA2> The art for this stream is gonna be weird.
[3:21:05] <yeildingthought> LUL
[3:21:06] <%DensityD> clip it
[3:21:07] <Lieutenant_America> Because this game IS held together with spit and duct tape
[3:21:07] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America You ever just sit and watch the vortigaunts without killing them? Their pathing, aim and AI is wonky
[3:21:08] <@Solidus_113> I'm back from shopping what the fuck is going on
[3:21:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> GOT DAYUM
[3:21:09] <+huggablemantooth> beautifiul
[3:21:09] <major_gnuisance> Was Isaac's Mom's Basement Xen all along?!
[3:21:10] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[3:21:10] <yeildingthought> Yes!
[3:21:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @KnivesEve Do you not SEE the nutsack? that is a KING bruh
[3:21:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> light tha fire
[3:21:11] <%Javaa01> Pour the ContentID
[3:21:13] <+Rabbitmage> STOP
[3:21:15] <blaggablag> Came for the nutsack, stayed for the SOUL
[3:21:19] <%rubbishbinge> woolieGASM
[3:21:19] <DukeBlack_> gwdMerp
[3:21:35] <+Balkespower> RUN WOOLIE!
[3:21:37] <%andrei11dr> Wat amazing lyrics Kappa
[3:21:46] <%natebud> @LiquidDinosaur No, they just never miss as long as they can see you, but the levels were designed around it. you can just run circles around them now.
[3:21:49] <%optimasmaximas> @solidus_113 was the store packed?
[3:21:50] <binku_muja_> So Freeman is Mr Bombastic in this scenario?
[3:21:51] <+Balkespower> good job
[3:21:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think Woolie has been hanging out with the Achivement Hunters too much.... they infected him with impromptu vocals.
[3:21:53] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud They sure seem to cook MY ass. They're a lot dodgier now, and they got their behaviors back where they heal each other or run when wounded
[3:21:55] <blaggablag> SACKD!
[3:21:56] <+Balkespower> You need to run!
[3:22:06] <TheMorilo> Woolie doesn't know it's a chase scene
[3:22:07] <+Balkespower> this time you need to bitch out
[3:22:08] <%DensityD> objective: run like crash bandicoot
[3:22:10] <Professor_Rakor> It just gets so slippery when she's around.
[3:22:18] <Camail> get fucked
[3:22:25] <$tallik44123> hey woolie love your lp so have some bits Cheer1000
[3:22:29] <@Solidus_113> Naw everything's pretty empty. they've enacted social distancing though
[3:22:37] <fairore> @professor_rakor BlessRNG WutFace
[3:22:38] <Lieutenant_America> I have seen little issues with their aim that wasn't in HL1. Strafe them and they miss. Stand still and eat lightning
[3:22:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> Hey does Half Life Alyx show any instances of humans eating headcrabs or just Vorts? I wanna know if that's become an accepted part of the human diet
[3:22:49] <+Rabbitmage> get tech throwed
[3:22:53] <+Balkespower> Run to your left
[3:22:54] <%Javaa01> Just run
[3:22:57] <Camail> literally turn the other way
[3:22:58] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America they never missed when you strafe in HL1
[3:23:01] <+BNPhone> PORT
[3:23:03] <EDFscout> why would you run AT it?
[3:23:08] <TheMorilo> Run to PORT
[3:23:12] <Man_F_Artwish> I put it in and BAM
[3:23:12] <anne_arkie> I'd eat a headcrab kebab
[3:23:21] <Camail> GIT GUD
[3:23:23] <%natebud> That's the point of the enemy, they never missed @Lieutenant_America
[3:23:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> I'd fuck with headcrab on a stick
[3:23:25] <EDFscout> BUUSTO
[3:23:26] <%Haarute> momma's fast
[3:23:31] <%Javaa01> You gotta use your movement abilities
[3:23:34] <awalr> speed.
[3:23:35] <Tsoulus> I thought the regular street kebab WAS headcrab kebab?
[3:23:37] <%andrei11dr> Woolie has the environmental awareness of Elmo
[3:23:43] <+justred4short> woah
[3:23:45] <+DreyfussFrost> FailFish
[3:23:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie's getting donkey punched.
[3:23:46] <major_gnuisance> @Lieutenant_America In my experience with HL:Source, if they have a line of sight they WILL hit. Might be different in the original.
[3:23:48] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I am willing to bet money that you can dodge their bolts
[3:23:52] <%Javaa01> Feel that sac slap you
[3:23:52] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America You can just run circles around them now. And that ground pound attack they added is stopped by everything including small slopes and curbs.
[3:23:55] <%jiggy_snipe> she wants to peg Woolie
[3:24:12] <%Javaa01> Gotta hit that detonator
[3:24:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Girl be bringing out the Strap On and Woolie is noping the fuck out of there.
[3:24:35] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America not in half life source, at least
[3:24:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> why dont they give vortigaunts armor?
[3:24:45] <%natebud> or opposing force
[3:24:48] <Lieutenant_America> Well I don't play the Source version
[3:24:55] <Tsoulus> they expedited the shit out of this place
[3:24:57] <%Haarute> yo this juggle
[3:24:58] <+xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Getting juggled
[3:24:59] <Lieutenant_America> I don't mean that in an elitist way
[3:24:59] <binku_muja_> Getting rocked
[3:25:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> why the fuck would you play Half-Life source it has no gibs
[3:25:01] <Professor_Rakor> Them wall combos.
[3:25:04] <+justred4short> damn can i dude get some I-frames after some melee damage?
[3:25:06] <Lieutenant_America> I just stick to GoldSrc
[3:25:07] <+justred4short> a*
[3:25:08] <EDFscout> @LiquidDinosaur what are they, soldiers?
[3:25:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> did the AI bug out?
[3:25:14] <%Javaa01> Dribbling you like a HnK infinite
[3:25:18] <+Rabbitmage> Gonarch got the corner combos
[3:25:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @EDFscout i mean, they're slaves who are often pressed into battle yah
[3:25:25] <Lieutenant_America> Also Source bugged more than a few things
[3:25:32] <+BNPhone> HL:S has gibs on explosions
[3:25:38] <Lieutenant_America> Like helicopters that die to a sneeze, and fucked jumping
[3:25:59] <%Haarute> oh no game bugged
[3:26:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Monster girl saw Reggie's butt stream earlier and now she can't handle herself.
[3:26:02] <major_gnuisance> @Lieutenant_America You're not wrong.
[3:26:07] <DandyCaballero> What is this?
[3:26:08] <%natebud> Jumping is way better in Source.
[3:26:16] <Lieutenant_America> Not for HL1
[3:26:25] <%Javaa01> The water is toxic here
[3:26:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[3:26:27] <Lieutenant_America> That elevator shaft in Office Complex is a BITCH in Source
[3:26:40] <Lieutenant_America> Freeman's Mind even made a joke about it
[3:26:46] <Lieutenant_America> Where Gordon misses the jumo
[3:26:47] <Man_F_Artwish> Get spanked
[3:26:47] <%DensityD> i'm coming up here because you designed it
[3:26:52] <Lieutenant_America> *jump
[3:26:54] <%natebud> definitely. I went from source to opposing force and the jumping felt terrible in that game. No coyote time at all.
[3:27:02] <+Balkespower> just drop down
[3:27:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> Radioactive spider blood
[3:27:07] <%Javaa01> In the hole
[3:27:14] <%DensityD> troopahs report in
[3:27:17] <major_gnuisance> I need to check if the GoldSrc supports the kind of commands I'm using to play with a DS4
[3:27:17] <Tsoulus> bowser is at the end of this
[3:27:18] <+gutlesscoward> I can't believe bowser was behind it all
[3:27:18] <%andrei11dr> Welp now Gordon has cancer on his balls
[3:27:21] <EDFscout> hole
[3:27:29] <%Javaa01> Just go into the wooliehole
[3:27:32] <%DensityD> but peach is in another castle (super beast)
[3:27:32] <Visorak6> get in the woolie hole
[3:27:33] <blaggablag> oops all spikes
[3:27:39] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I dunno what to tell you. But I *am* gonna test strafing vorts in HL1 classic.
[3:27:43] <Tsoulus> andrei11dr no is ok he has the HIV suit
[3:27:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gordon gonna be getting that Elephantitus.
[3:27:45] <Lieutenant_America> After the stream
[3:27:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> Is Half-Life Decay worth playing
[3:28:03] <arvidonfire> Koopy Sandwich
[3:28:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @liquiddinosaur God no
[3:28:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CommanderSqueaks worse than Blue Shift and OpFor?
[3:28:25] <%DensityD> hey woolie tell me about shirts
[3:28:37] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America go for it.
[3:28:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> STOP SAYING HONEYDICKING
[3:28:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @liquiddinosaur Yes.
[3:28:53] <major_gnuisance> Is the game running off of a HDD or are the load times that bad?
[3:28:57] <Tsoulus> half life decay definitely not worth
[3:29:07] <Tsoulus> you are supposed to play this with a mouse
[3:29:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> Because honestly i kind of like Blue Shift. most people dont
[3:29:12] <+BNPhone> this games just all around busted @majorgnuisance
[3:29:16] <%DensityD> enough to kill anything that moves
[3:29:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE SPOT COULD BE EVEN BETTER THO
[3:29:20] <Man_F_Artwish> On an ssd the loading was great
[3:29:33] <Tsoulus> not playing FPS games with a mouse is like playing fighing games with a mouse
[3:29:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Blue Shift was 'okay'.
[3:29:34] <Lieutenant_America> Today I've learned that Half Life takes are way more divisive than I realized
[3:29:38] <KeystoneA2> he fell apart lol
[3:29:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> I honestly find it weird and incongruous Barney has canonically been to Xen
[3:29:54] <%Javaa01> Gotta round that corner
[3:29:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, are those Spider headcrabs?
[3:30:05] <+BNPhone> nah just babies
[3:30:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CommanderSqueaks babies. Birthed by the gonarch
[3:30:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur Blue Shift was very short and didn't add anything. OpFor had new weapons and enemies
[3:30:12] <major_gnuisance> @Tsoulus competitively, yes. Single player, gyro aim's got your back.
[3:30:13] <TheMorilo> lil baby crabbies
[3:30:14] <KeystoneA2> @LiquidDinosaur Shephard too, considering he ran in the room literally 1 second before Gordon jumped into Xen
[3:30:18] <%Javaa01> The corner in the crawlspace
[3:30:19] <%Haarute> they're baby headcrabs. this is the mother headcrab.
[3:30:21] <@Solidus_113> god I love the source-branded meat slap sounds
[3:30:22] <Lieutenant_America> Honestly I never jived with Opposing Force because Race X feels completely out of nowhere
[3:30:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, any species where the animals are BIRTHED ready to murder has got to go.
[3:30:34] <arvidonfire> F O O T S I E S
[3:30:38] <akman14> THE LID WOOLIE
[3:30:39] <%Javaa01> Just crouch woolie
[3:30:42] <Professor_Rakor> this is where you dropped down
[3:30:43] <%Vorga1339> what I wouldn't give to just be sitting next to him
[3:30:43] <+BNPhone> the obvious route is often the correct one woolie
[3:30:46] <Tsoulus> majorgnuisance but then you can just watch a movie instead of playing a game
[3:30:46] <Man_F_Artwish> Race x is awesome
[3:30:48] <%Vorga1339> and to show
[3:30:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @KeystoneA2 Ehhhh he got spit out immediately. I dont know if that can even count since apparently all teleportation involved "Slingshotting around Xen"
[3:30:56] <Lieutenant_America> Plus the idea that one squad of marines somehow missed the "kill everyone" memo is weird to me
[3:31:13] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:31:15] <Lieutenant_America> LIVING ROCKS
[3:31:17] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:31:17] <%DensityD> lmao
[3:31:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> "ROCKS"
[3:31:19] <%natebud> Opposing Force is pretty weak once you get past the novelty of the new weapons and enemies. Race X just behave like reskins of existing enemies with more health
[3:31:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Lieutenant_America that's not even that weird to me. its more why the fuck are scientists helping you
[3:31:22] <Zayasu> Jebaited

[3:32:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Lieutenant_America also dont the scientists heal you in opFOr?
[3:32:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie got faked out by a creature whose sole operating protocol is "BITE HEAD".
[3:32:12] <Lieutenant_America> Probably
[3:32:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> If so why? they're not that kind of doctor. do they just have some heroin on hand?
[3:32:23] <Lieutenant_America> Which IS a mechanic I wish was in Black Meaa
[3:32:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> are they ALL Gordon Freeman from Freeman's Mind?
[3:32:33] <Lieutenant_America> Supposedly it's in the code but currently dummied out
[3:32:42] <+BNPhone> the scientists heal you in every hl game it's just video game shit @LiquidDinosaur

[3:35:11] <zamzoph> Fire bad! WutFace
[3:35:18] <a_mad_dragon> bitterUngo FIRE BAD
[3:35:28] <%RioGascar> i dont really think im spoiling anything
[3:35:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AxelssonOnFire
[3:35:43] <%RioGascar> i am actually disappointed in black mesa for doing this
[3:35:43] <%natebud> How come you can break some webs, but not others?
[3:35:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tsoulus I do like that they took their own swing at it instead of just completely rehashing the original.
[3:35:58] <Tsoulus> CommanderSqueaks preach!
[3:36:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, wait, are we just seeing how Woolie courted Punch Mom?
[3:36:05] <major_gnuisance> @natebud video game logic, AmIrItE?
[3:36:08] <%aceleapc> the webs you can break are much thinner

[3:36:24] <@Solidus_113> sloppy seconds?
[3:36:29] <%natebud> @majorgnuisance nah, video game logic would be all or none for clarity.
[3:36:44] <+BNPhone> it's the difference between braking yarn and wooden planks @natebud

[3:37:20] <major_gnuisance> @natebud gamedevs must love it when people only ever say "video game logic" to point out inconsistencies
[3:37:27] <Tsoulus> naaa
[3:37:30] <%Javaa01> No you were supposed to shoot the explosives, they're the only way to raise the water level

[3:43:21] <dukenux> WOW
[3:43:21] <+Balkespower> Woolie shows how it is done!
[3:43:26] <major_gnuisance> "I fucked your mom" being a cuck move has... interesting implications.
[3:43:31] <%Javaa01> Cause for some slight internal tensions
[3:43:36] <+chvmpchange> uh oh he didn't see the red explosive plants
[3:43:46] <Lieutenant_America> @majorgnuisance Literally a Sonic 06 Snapcube joke
[3:43:48] <%RioGascar> so if you cuck a headcrab...do you HEAD FUCK THE PERSON THEY ARE TRYING TO ZOMBIE?
[3:43:50] <hologram_sam> where's the nba story game of THAT
[3:43:52] <%The_Timo> It's because he could only call him Daddy from then on. and yelling daddy on the court seems too weird
[3:43:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @chvmpchange Woolie's too busy thinking about MILFS.
[3:43:53] <%Haarute> honestly, respect.
[3:43:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> I didnt even see the HEV pants when i played
[3:43:57] <dukenux> the guy who banged Le Bron's mom is now homeless?

[3:45:20] <%neraren> The rocks fell through 2 floors, you want the floor in the middle
[3:45:22] <+BNPhone> explosive room i mean
[3:45:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> BLOW UP THE THINGS
[3:45:26] <TheMorilo> We will probably not galunga today
[3:45:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alright, someone start the timer, I think we're looking at a Paige Shadow Puzzle situation
[3:45:42] <%natebud> Timesink * (Woolie constant)
[3:45:43] <ingman112> Use what changed: check the room where the rocks fell
[3:45:53] <+DreyfussFrost> If dropping the rocks didn't change anything then you're probably not done there.
[3:46:00] <+RueOrin> @CommanderSqueaks That doesn't seem possible.
[3:46:15] <@Solidus_113> can you go further down from here
[3:46:16] <+chvmpchange> he just needs to look down through the hole and shoot the red things
[3:46:20] <EDFscout> Kappa
[3:46:21] <Professor_Rakor> look in the hole without dropping in
[3:46:25] <+Balkespower> shoot red things
[3:46:25] <%Javaa01> Second set of explosives near the water in the hole
[3:46:28] <TheMorilo> Kappa
[3:46:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie go into your hole
[3:46:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> LOOK IN HOLE
[3:46:33] <%The_Timo> @natebud we should find what the woolie constant is. so we can use it to guess LP lengths lol
[3:46:34] <%natebud> look with your eyes into the hole
[3:46:37] <%neraren> Look in the woolie hole!
[3:46:39] <EDFscout> BOMBS IN THE HOLE
[3:46:45] <+DreyfussFrost> Look for more than HALF A SECOND
[3:46:56] <+chvmpchange> based reggie
[3:47:11] <+Balkespower> yes.

[3:47:20] <+Rabbitmage> gonarch water temple
[3:47:20] <+chvmpchange> imagine if this was a solo lp
[3:47:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @natebud It's not a problem with Woolie's eyes, it's a problem with Woolie's brain.
[3:47:34] <+Balkespower> Underwater levels can go to hell
[3:47:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:47:39] <jackelzxaa> the chapter after this is longer than surface tension so theres a chance he will have to do a second session to beat it
[3:47:41] <%The_Timo> @CommanderSqueaks It's both really
[3:47:48] <MyNameIsRasus> How long we got, chat?
[3:47:51] <jackelzxaa> the second to last chapter is super long in this
[3:48:00] <%natebud> @chvmpchange First level: I didn't even see that plug on the ground, my brain just ignored it
[3:48:04] <+Balkespower> We will see at 4 hours at least
[3:48:14] <DSD24> Doom Eternal?
[3:48:15] <Mrthefro> LUL
[3:48:15] <zamzoph> Too much water
[3:48:18] <jackelzxaa> sonic 3 had 5 water levels and that game is a 10/10
[3:48:18] <+Balkespower> maybe more judging by this pace
[3:48:27] <%Prevot> that's not true at all
[3:48:28] <MattDemers> Water levels are only good if they're some kind of surfing auto-scroller.
[3:48:31] <jackelzxaa> sonic 3 has twelve or fourteen stages and half of them are water
[3:48:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Water DUNGEONS are bad, water LEVELS can be fine.
[3:48:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is a water dungeon.
[3:48:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Follow up OoT with OCEAN ZELDA
[3:48:42] <zamzoph> giant enemies in the water is the worst monkaS
[3:48:43] <%Prevot> twilight princess water temple was also pretty shit
[3:48:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> DMC 1 Water Level
[3:48:48] <%Atomik456> WW somehow has no water level despite being on afucking ocean based game
[3:48:55] <+huggablemantooth> every level is a water level in ECCO
[3:48:57] <dukenux> I can't think of water level that's like "wow this was a good, memorable level of this game"
[3:49:02] <%RioGascar> water levels get confusing in 3d cause you float now
[3:49:08] <%neraren> WWs water level is the toower
[3:49:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> I like the water level in Sonic Rush
[3:49:13] <jackelzxaa> chemical plant and hydro city are fantastic water levels in sonic because they're basically hyper tube levels
[3:49:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> Killing children is not cucking
[3:49:18] <Man_F_Artwish> I like water levels
[3:49:19] <+BNPhone> Woolie don't know what cuck means
[3:49:19] <%Atomik456> wait she's the one getting cucked now?
[3:49:19] <%natebud> Look at this puzzle mechanic that the devs didn't know what to do with.
[3:49:20] <%RioGascar> you go up down left right
[3:49:24] <major_gnuisance> @dukenux If all levels are water levels, then none of them are.
[3:49:32] <%RioGascar> HOW DO YOU CUCK A HEADCRAB
[3:49:32] <%Javaa01> LOOK UP
[3:49:35] <jackelzxaa> i kind of like the water in half life becaue there's that "exploration/puzzle" element
[3:49:36] <+chvmpchange> metroid prime had decent water areas
[3:49:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> The headcrabs would be getting cucked
[3:49:37] <+Balkespower> look up please
[3:49:39] <Tsoulus> ok boomer!!!
[3:49:43] <@Solidus_113> Does the Headcrab wear a superman cape, or do the need to take over a human to wear the full suit first?
[3:49:45] <Man_F_Artwish> Ty the Tasmanian tiger had amazing water stages.
[3:49:48] <jackelzxaa> where if i see something new under water it feels alot more interesting than if i saw it above water
[3:49:53] <anne_arkie> nearly fully transparent water in games is a bit of a bad mood imo. too confusing and too much visibility kind of ruins the illusion
[3:49:57] <+BNPhone> LOOK
[3:49:59] <%natebud> invisible walls now
[3:50:01] <+Balkespower> Very guuuuuuuuuuud
[3:50:07] <+TeddyBrosefvelt> Just buy the crabs some v-bucks so it can get that new dance it wants
[3:50:17] <%Atomik456> o2 wools
[3:50:19] <jackelzxaa> i wonder f valve gave them any notes on what to do with xen so it didnt clash with thier future plans for half life games
[3:50:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Solidus_113 it has to take over Superman like that justice league episode where a alien parasite is on Superman's head that makes him think hes living a fake happy life on Krypton
[3:50:27] <DSD24> @Tersalus I know I hate swimming in Elder Scrolls games cause water always looks so bad

[3:50:42] <yamikami13> @WoolieVersus so this is more a a twitter question but any anime this season caught your interest woolie?
[3:50:45] <%RioGascar> Gonna drown
[3:50:54] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Also turns out you can indeed dodge Vorts in GoldSrc HL1. It's more that the level architecture favors duck-and-cover over Doomstrafing
[3:50:56] <SixthSun2> *Sonic drowning music intensifies*
[3:50:59] <@Solidus_113> YOU DO
[3:51:00] <Shaotanzhiten> Ichthyosaurs are beeefy
[3:51:01] <alrobot2014> you have 12
[3:51:02] <%natebud> You can survive for a solid minute underwater if you have full health

[3:51:26] <jackelzxaa> reggie is better than navi, he's midna
[3:51:28] <major_gnuisance> Someone needs to mod in Sonic_theme_of_stress.ogg
[3:51:30] <anne_arkie> @dsd24 it's a tough balance! extremely murky water in games just makes it no fun to explore too,
[3:51:35] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America Does it look intentional?
[3:51:39] <Rei_Dsoto> Keep being Awesome Woolie!
[3:51:43] <TheMorilo> BASED REGGIE

[3:51:49] <anne_arkie> that being said, subnautica nailed the water effects...
[3:51:53] <dukenux> @jackelzxaa i don't want to think of Reggie as Midna. that's.... dangerous
[3:51:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jackelzxaa Both trigger inappropriate feelings in many many people?
[3:52:02] <jackelzxaa> listen
[3:52:03] <%BinaryFireball> Binary_Fireball is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel!
[3:52:04] <%BinaryFireball> Binary_Fireball gifted a Tier 1 sub to MaddyCaddy!
[3:52:04] <jackelzxaa> if pat is navi
[3:52:05] <Tsoulus> those reverse barnacles are cool
[3:52:07] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I mean I don't exactly have the devs on speed dial
[3:52:09] <@Solidus_113> you're pretty much done here
[3:52:13] <%Javaa01> Just go to the colored lights
[3:52:18] <%Javaa01> At the surface
[3:52:18] <DSD24> @Tersalus That game had too cause can you imagine a game like that with bad water?
[3:52:18] <kingmatthiaz> Lol woolie can't trust Reggie after Dokapon lol
[3:52:28] <anne_arkie> reverse barnacles....selcanrab...
[3:52:35] <Lieutenant_America> But I did it plenty in my playtime of HL1 (plus mods like Echoes)
[3:52:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kingmatthiaz Naw, Reggie is Lawful Good, it's just Lawful Good doesn't exist in Dokapon.
[3:52:54] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America now i have to test it,
[3:52:59] <major_gnuisance> @Tersalus have you thought about getting a job at naming Pokémon?
[3:52:59] <Shaotanzhiten> No, not at all
[3:52:59] <anne_arkie> @dsd24 haha, it would be completely unplayable. I guess that's the most important thing to get right, and they did that
[3:52:59] <@Solidus_113> hell no
[3:53:00] <dukenux> No.
[3:53:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> no
[3:53:00] <+BNPhone> No
[3:53:01] <ionfamous> Nope
[3:53:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> No
[3:53:02] <2deep5u> no
[3:53:02] <KeystoneA2> not really
[3:53:03] <unit24> not even close
[3:53:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> HELL NO
[3:53:04] <EDFscout> like 3 levels
[3:53:04] <Twichty> not at all
[3:53:05] <Lieutenant_America> Nope
[3:53:05] <Mysidian_Maestro> No way.
[3:53:05] <%Javaa01> Zen was around an hour
[3:53:05] <+treborant> Nope
[3:53:06] <Tsoulus> you think those crystals can charge my model S?
[3:53:07] <+jjanddjango> No this Xen is much longer.
[3:53:07] <%Tearonex> No, completely redone
[3:53:10] <jackelzxaa> xen wasn't long before. this version is alot longer because it was a huge wait for it
[3:53:11] <%natebud> first xen level was 15 minutes in the original @WoolieVersus
[3:53:12] <Mysidian_Maestro> An hour long or so.
[3:53:14] <privatesargent> no, and there still is A LOT more Zen left
[3:53:15] <dukenux> hoo
[3:53:16] <jackelzxaa> woolie is about halfway through Xen
[3:53:17] <%BinaryFireball> xen was shoooort
[3:53:18] <Tomas2886Cz> you would be done like 2 hours ago
[3:53:19] <+DreyfussFrost> You would have already finished the game by now.
[3:53:22] <Visorak6> You've got a really long chapter to go
[3:53:23] <@Solidus_113> Xen was the "quick make a finale we're out of development time"
[3:53:27] <%The_Timo> Well it would have been 2 for Woolie back in the day
[3:53:29] <Lieutenant_America> Xen is basically Act 3 in Black Mesa
[3:53:29] <puluxor> This fight is really convoluted and unfocused in Black Mesa
[3:53:30] <KeystoneA2> This game's Xen could pass for a full game's length
[3:53:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks Dokapon has 2 alignments. Chaotic Evil and Chaotic Thief.
[3:53:36] <jackelzxaa> Someone who has the points tell woolie that he's about halfway through Xen
[3:53:37] <%Javaa01> Yeah if Woolie wasn't the active variable here, we could have been done hours ago
[3:53:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> Xen was the Lost Izalith of Half-Life
[3:53:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> Maybe one more stream and you'll beat it
[3:53:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Not ready girl, I still need to get freshened up."
[3:53:48] <Man_F_Artwish> I love this Xen like 100x more.
[3:53:53] <MyNameIsRasus> There's way more left, enough for another stream
[3:53:55] <anne_arkie> @majorgnuisance all you have to do is take two things, put them together, and make a stupid pun...my idiocy is a talent
[3:53:59] <Tsoulus> SKRT SKRT
[3:54:01] <jackelzxaa> it took me a while to do black mesa xen my first time because i wanted to explore and look at everything
[3:54:06] <%RioGascar> i like this xen...but like
[3:54:09] <Tsoulus> BasedGod
[3:54:10] <jackelzxaa> i was doing it basically the whole day
[3:54:11] <%RioGascar> it doesnt fix xen
[3:54:17] <jackelzxaa> since its new half life
[3:54:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton And Chaotic Stupid.
[3:54:21] <Lieutenant_America> I still vastly prefer this Xen
[3:54:22] <jackelzxaa> i think it fixes xen
[3:54:22] <MattDemers> Ooh, Gordon grunt. Not used to that.
[3:54:25] <+BNPhone> This Xen is prettier but I have no desire to ever play it again. It's just... such a slog
[3:54:31] <Mysidian_Maestro> I think the original Gonarch fight might be the worst part of HL1.
[3:54:33] <%Javaa01> And here we go
[3:54:33] <@Solidus_113> NOW
[3:54:34] <jackelzxaa> the only thing i want is interloper to get some bits tightened up so there isn't rule of 3 stuff
[3:54:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[3:54:36] <dukenux> Fuck there's the goddamn grunt factory level after NotLikeThis
[3:54:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> Boss Fight
[3:54:36] <Twichty> NOW
[3:54:38] <zamzoph> look at this arena
[3:54:39] <%RioGascar> mechanics ESTABLISHED
[3:54:40] <%natebud> It's better in some ways, but it's bloated. Rewatching all this, it doesn't look fun.
[3:54:40] <privatesargent> NOW the fight
[3:54:40] <Camail> FUCK FIGHT
[3:54:41] <MattDemers> BIG WUBS INCOMING
[3:54:42] <Twichty> Boss Arena Time
[3:54:42] <Man_F_Artwish> I think it replaces shit Xen.
[3:54:45] <+Balkespower> GET LAUNCHER BOI!
[3:54:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RioGascar Yahtzee said this: In summary, Half-Life was a handsome, intelligent and smartly dressed man who was inexplicably wearing one bright green wellington boot. I don’t think the solution was to put on the other wellington boot.
[3:54:49] <Lieutenant_America> Also this boss fight is WAY better in 1.0
[3:54:50] <SixthSun2> SourPls
[3:54:51] <jackelzxaa> woolie has his character action half life boss fight with an air dash
[3:54:51] <Tsoulus> this fight took foreeeeeeeever on hard
[3:54:51] <Camail> SourPls
[3:54:51] <@Solidus_113> You've brought her back to her bedroom
[3:54:53] <2deep5u> SHOWDOWN WITH CRABMOM
[3:54:59] <Lieutenant_America> Pre-release Gonarch now THAT was a bitch
[3:54:59] <%SirGO0SE> sipsipHellmo SourPls sipsipHellmo
[3:55:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> FUCK FIGHT! HIT THE BIG FUTA BALLS!
[3:55:01] <%natebud> @LiquidDinosaur quite
[3:55:01] <Shaotanzhiten> What that sac do
[3:55:02] <anne_arkie> is Gonarch technically the first boss you fight in the game?
[3:55:06] <AlwaysBeGaming> SourPls cvHazmat
[3:55:22] <Lieutenant_America> @Tersalus Technically it's the Tentacles
[3:55:26] <jackelzxaa> woolie turned the targeting off on the rockets because he tapped alt fire
[3:55:28] <Lieutenant_America> Or the Military vehicles
[3:55:29] <@Solidus_113> ELECTRO PALY?
[3:55:29] <+BNPhone> well if you wanna get real technical its tentacle
[3:55:30] <@Solidus_113> PLAY
[3:55:31] <Camail> SHOCKMASTER
[3:55:32] <dukenux> CBT
[3:55:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tersalus You can consider the 'copter a boss.
[3:55:33] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:55:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> SHOCK THE BALLS
[3:55:33] <%natebud> ZAP HIS NADS
[3:55:34] <Parapattern> CBT
[3:55:35] <jackelzxaa> gonarch is into ryona
[3:55:36] <+Trevelyan_Dovah> thickTOXIC
[3:55:37] <major_gnuisance> I'm gonna go on a limb and guess that this music choice wasn't exactly universally acclaimed.
[3:55:38] <+treborant> Dat CBT
[3:55:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> SHOCKER!
[3:55:48] <Lieutenant_America> But in Xen you get more traditional Bullet Sponge bosses
[3:55:50] <anne_arkie> ah, that makes sense. I always forget about the vehicles
[3:55:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gordon knows how to please a xeno.
[3:55:57] <awalr> don't act like you don't like the ball bustah
[3:56:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> needleplay too?
[3:56:02] <kingmatthiaz> Lmao woolie Pause
[3:56:03] <a_mad_dragon> don't think small arms even hurts it
[3:56:03] <Lieutenant_America> @majorgnuisance Better than Jungle Drums
[3:56:06] <Tsoulus> out of the coroner
[3:56:12] <+Trevelyan_Dovah> Use rawkets
[3:56:15] <jackelzxaa> i like the xen music
[3:56:17] <%aceleapc> how does he keep accidentally crouching
[3:56:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> She ain't gonna feel that weak as shit Woolie, you gotta go in with the big toys.
[3:56:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> Black Mesa has a good soundtrack but it inserts the songs with all the elegance of an anime AMV
[3:56:31] <%RioGascar> xens newer music sounds a lot the same
[3:56:34] <dukenux> i like Xen music more than "base game" soundtrack tbh
[3:56:34] <TheMorilo> woolie with the permacrouch tech
[3:56:35] <jackelzxaa> xen is basically a burnout hippie dream
[3:56:41] <%RioGascar> this ones not much different from the other tracks
[3:56:42] <Lieutenant_America> The rockets respawn
[3:56:42] <+Balkespower> Use Rockets, Woolie
[3:56:44] <jackelzxaa> the tonal shift in music does alot
[3:56:46] <akman14> ROCKETMAN , man
[3:56:53] <MyNameIsRasus> USE THE BAD DRAGON WOOLZ
[3:57:09] <+BNPhone> This song is getting constantly remixed in xen and it's the only song I can remember which is fine because it kind of a banger
[3:57:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> USE THOR WOOLIE
[3:57:14] <thesoothe> Jesus this crab has a lot of HP
[3:57:18] <privatesargent> the adds are the most annoying part of this fight
[3:57:21] <%CalebHatesGames> CalebHatesGames subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Appreciate you fellas. Stay safe.
[3:57:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> USE THE XL FLARED CHANCE!
[3:57:25] <Lieutenant_America> @xx123manxx The song during the Gargantua chase is awesome too
[3:57:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton Okay that's WAY too specific.
[3:57:33] <anne_arkie> Just like the dark souls tree nutsack boss!!
[3:57:34] <+Balkespower> LET'S DANCE!
[3:57:36] <%jiggy_snipe> damn it's like a fighting game stage lol
[3:57:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> XD
[3:57:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @xx123manxx hey its like Republic Commando. they just have THAT ONE MANDALORIAN WAR CHANT and they play it EVERY SINGLE HEATED MOMENT
[3:57:42] <Explodincatz> inb4 woolie dies
[3:57:42] <Man_F_Artwish> All of Xen music is orgasmic
[3:57:43] <+BNPhone> agreed however i cant remember it i just remember it being cool LUL @Lieutenant_America
[3:57:44] <dukenux> Shake it baby
[3:57:45] <dukenux> Wanna dance?
[3:57:49] <+Balkespower> SHE IS STRUGGLING!
[3:57:51] <jackelzxaa> look at woolie getting into the dynamic storytelling of half life in 2020
[3:57:53] <Twichty> im sure these isolated clips wont come back to haunt woolie at all :)
[3:57:54] <+Balkespower> FINISH HER!
[3:57:58] <Shaotanzhiten> Just murder those babies, bud
[3:58:01] <%DensityD> please dust my wets
[3:58:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> SOAKED
[3:58:05] <%SirGO0SE> zoneGasm woolieGASM
[3:58:06] <%Haarute> yo this fight is so good in this version
[3:58:07] <DSD24> This sounds like the Armor Spider from Demon's Souls
[3:58:12] <major_gnuisance> Mind the distinction between music being good and being fitting.
[3:58:14] <%prime_name> Is this what PunchMom deals with?
[3:58:15] <%natebud> why he crouch?
[3:58:20] <Lieutenant_America> @xx123manxx You are right in that a lot of Xen is built around a single theme, compared to the multiple leitmotifs and pitches of the Earthbound chpaters
[3:58:21] <+BNPhone> CROWBAR IT TO DEATH COWARD
[3:58:24] <+Balkespower> YES!
[3:58:24] <Man_F_Artwish> This is my orgy music
[3:58:27] <%DensityD> SPLOOSH
[3:58:28] <awalr> nutlord slain
[3:58:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks Everyone's heard of chance. I can't remember which one Thor is.
[3:58:28] <%Atomik456> Atomik456 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! SPLOOSH
[3:58:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> someone put some d'angelo on
[3:58:30] <%jiggy_snipe> SPLOOSH
[3:58:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> The big death.
[3:58:33] <%Irridium> BURST
[3:58:35] <TheMorilo> Great kill
[3:58:35] <%SirGO0SE> SHOW TIME
[3:58:35] <jackelzxaa> Gonarch splooshed all over woolie
[3:58:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> Dies to baby headcrabs
[3:58:36] <+Balkespower> BIG O
[3:58:39] <%natebud> you didn't win. I exploded myself
[3:58:39] <Tsoulus> put lady gage on
[3:58:42] <MyNameIsRasus> PETIT MORT
[3:58:42] <+xerotwo> KABLOOEY
[3:58:42] <%DensityD> Cast in the name of god, ye be not guilty
[3:58:45] <%Haarute> [bloodborne font] "MOM FUCKED"
[3:58:46] <haisho> didnt expect a first try
[3:58:47] <anne_arkie> Rip Gonarch, such a stud
[3:58:51] <%Irridium> inflation until burst
[3:58:52] <2deep5u> the crabmom makes the same sound when she roars as the armored spider in demon's souls!
[3:58:52] <6beats> Busted
[3:58:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> WOULD YOU STOP PLAYING WITH THAT RADIO OF YOURS? I'M TRYING TO GET TO SLEEP
[3:58:58] <Lieutenant_America> Anyone who beat Gonarch in Beta deserves a cash prize
[3:59:00] <%DensityD> lemme get my vape pen
[3:59:00] <%SirGO0SE> mommy's feeling a little dehydrated..
[3:59:01] <+Balkespower> NNow have fun with Interloper
[3:59:02] <jackelzxaa> get ready for xen: second half
[3:59:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> stepson dont like that
[3:59:03] <KeystoneA2> Coom
[3:59:06] <%ChoculaUltra> Gonarch but not forgotten FeelsBadMan
[3:59:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> LA GRANDE MORTE
[3:59:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie's going in even deeper.
[3:59:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> that's what she said
[3:59:16] <jackelzxaa> woolie: you're halfway through xen
[3:59:19] <%optimasmaximas> @liquiddinosaur awryyyy
[3:59:21] <anne_arkie> @choculaultra incredible
[3:59:27] <+Rabbitmage> She just wanted to protect her kids BibleThump
[3:59:34] <jackelzxaa> HALF WAY POINT
[3:59:35] <%MaddyCaddy> haha gonarch go splorch
[3:59:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> Yeah Basically Yahtzee said that Xen is GOOD but its A. too long and B. thematically and aesthetically incongruous with the rest of Half-Life, but this problem still existed in HL1
[3:59:38] <%Javaa01> And you're now an entire HALF WAY through Zen
[3:59:44] <Man_F_Artwish> Some people don’t like the second half but I fucking love it.
[3:59:47] <+Balkespower> now that we are done killing the ecosystem...
[3:59:49] <jackelzxaa> yahtzee's a bit of a stickler though
[3:59:53] <@Solidus_113> We're finally here
[4:00:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Leave my mama alone!" "No."
[4:00:01] <%optimasmaximas> DOOM
[4:00:03] <+Balkespower> LET'S KILL THE ALIEN CIVILASATION!
[4:00:03] <%MaddyCaddy> Last chapter?
[4:00:04] <jackelzxaa> half life 2 should have had a xen finale in ep3
[4:00:05] <TheMorilo> look up
[4:00:07] <major_gnuisance> @LiquidDinosaur To my shock and surprise, I looked up the lyrics and found "will you stop playing with that radio, Lord?"
[4:00:10] <+BNPhone> and now Xen gets worse than OG Xen
[4:00:12] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur Honestly I think it's more "in-line" with the rest of the game in Black Mesa in terms of design philosophy
[4:00:12] <dukenux> Oh wait, is this the part when Nihilant invades your brain?
[4:00:12] <%natebud> Snarks are good here
[4:00:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @jackelzxaa i mean he makes it clear when he LIKES something, he just then focuses on the parts he has issues with
[4:00:16] <MyNameIsRasus> look up
[4:00:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @liquiddinosaur I'll disagree with it, since I figured the WHOLE POINT of seeing Xen for a split second in the beginning was to foreshadow where you would end up.
[4:00:19] <jackelzxaa> they kind of brought xen to earth with the citadel and the antlion caves
[4:00:25] <major_gnuisance> *would
[4:00:32] <Tsoulus> GOTTA SONIC
[4:00:34] <jackelzxaa> yeah xen has to be completely different
[4:00:38] <%natebud> what
[4:00:39] <%Javaa01> So yeah, if you wanna cut the session, here would be a good time, because this chapter is sizable
[4:00:42] <Lieutenant_America> Also Yahtzee is a hack
[4:00:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> I dont fully agree with him
[4:00:44] <%optimasmaximas> we dmc now yeyeyeye
[4:00:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> FWIW
[4:00:51] <NaturalGear> LUL
[4:00:54] <+BNPhone> just zoom past
[4:00:55] <Lieutenant_America> This would be a good place to end the session though
[4:00:56] <Meltgar> LOL ROLLING
[4:00:59] <%Javaa01> Just run and jump past these ones
[4:01:00] <Tsoulus> just WROOM WROOM
[4:01:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> Jump past with Jet pack
[4:01:10] <Man_F_Artwish> Let’s talk to the vorts
[4:01:10] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH woolieMirin
[4:01:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus They can hear you pull the pin on the grenade.
[4:01:16] <+greenfall> agree this is a good stopping point
[4:01:18] <%optimasmaximas> @woolieversus chat says ending session here is ideal
[4:01:23] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH !! woolieMIRIN
[4:01:31] <+DreyfussFrost> Just because you have A solution doesn't mean it's the ONLY solution.
[4:01:32] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:01:34] <Tsoulus> aint nothin but bitches
[4:01:35] <jackelzxaa> this is easily 4 more hours
[4:01:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:37] <Melchior_the_Wise> Yes
[4:01:39] <+greenfall> theres about another 2-3 hours left
[4:01:46] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH!! woolieMIRIN
[4:01:46] <@Solidus_113> NO FAITH
[4:01:56] <Lieutenant_America> I'm glad Woolie is enjoying Xen at least.
[4:01:57] <anne_arkie> doom eternal is looking good, didnt know you got a crowbar
[4:01:59] <+Balkespower> more like 4-5
[4:02:04] <jackelzxaa> yeah 4-5 hours
[4:02:05] <major_gnuisance> DO NOT underestimate the HEV's AIR BRAKES, Woolie!
[4:02:05] <%Javaa01> Yeah at the rate you're going, this is gonna take another 3 hours
[4:02:06] <dukenux> Dammit Woolie, why can't you have a bit F A I T H
[4:02:08] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH !! woolieMIRIN
[4:02:08] <EDFscout> Tap it!
[4:02:11] <jackelzxaa> woolie's too into it to look at chat
[4:02:24] <%optimasmaximas> @woolieversus check chat
[4:02:29] <Twichty> wrong way
[4:02:30] <+BNPhone> it faster for you to just die and reload than sramble thru the menu
[4:02:33] <dukenux> 20% lack of skill
[4:02:34] <major_gnuisance> Air control is super tight on stopping ONLY
[4:02:38] <%jiggy_snipe> there was alot of explosions
[4:02:40] <Tsoulus> HAHA
[4:02:41] <Twichty> dont go that way
[4:02:41] <jackelzxaa> the only thing i'd say is that you just cut a few rule of 3 puzzles from xen down to 1 or 2
[4:02:53] <+BNPhone> Good save
[4:02:53] <+Balkespower> SAVE
[4:02:54] <Lieutenant_America> @jackelzxaa That's fair
[4:02:55] <jackelzxaa> and cut the elevator climb at the end to a single floor stop
[4:02:58] <dukenux> it tickled you
[4:03:00] <jackelzxaa> instead of 3 stops
[4:03:14] <@Solidus_113> skipped like a rock
[4:03:14] <Man_F_Artwish> No fuck that the elevator is the best
[4:03:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> WOO
[4:03:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> Nahhhhh cut stuff out but give me more megaguon
[4:03:17] <Lieutenant_America> Boy do I love the Gluon in Interloper though
[4:03:17] <+Balkespower> Woolie learned how to surf
[4:03:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> megagluon
[4:03:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bitch didn't know this is an ice level.
[4:03:21] <Lieutenant_America> Also I love the Elevator
[4:03:21] <EDFscout> yeah you SLiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide
[4:03:23] <%aceleapc> stop crouching
[4:03:27] <+BNPhone> cha cha real smooth
[4:03:34] <jackelzxaa> how many meat gags does gordon freeman become in a single full playthrough?
[4:03:34] <Tsoulus> this man aint no 1.6 surfer
[4:03:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> Infinite Gluon is like the Dark Energy Gravity Gun
[4:03:43] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus Focus on when to stop. You stop on a dime mid-air.
[4:04:16] <lazysaiyajin> yes
[4:04:20] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus you're about halfway through xen. how long to beat doesn't really take first timer run into account.
[4:04:22] <Melchior_the_Wise> Tiger-Stripes
[4:04:25] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America I booted up Blue Shift and it seems like them missing is a bug. You can't just circle strafe them like in Black mesa.
[4:04:25] <Twichty> thats why im not sure auto run is on
[4:04:26] <@Solidus_113> are you letting go of the analog stick to jump?
[4:04:26] <anne_arkie> SUBMIT
[4:04:26] <%Haarute> you're freezing too much at the start
[4:04:31] <+Rabbitmage> Use a keyboard LUL
[4:04:41] <%BinaryFireball> use the force
[4:04:42] <+BNPhone> hes getting caught on gemoetry
[4:04:45] <%Haarute> just run and jump
[4:04:51] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus You're tripping on geometry. Pick another spot.
[4:05:05] <%Haarute> :)
[4:05:08] <Tsoulus> LUL
[4:05:11] <Tsoulus> it is true tho
[4:05:11] <dukenux> 4Head
[4:05:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> Stop looking down too
[4:05:19] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I dunno what to tell you, especially if your evidence is "looks like a bug". Besides, they've always felt pretty accurate to me in BM
[4:05:19] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:05:21] <jackelzxaa> i hope woolie gets to the big boner
[4:05:22] <+BNPhone> LUL
[4:05:23] <Tsoulus> HAHAH
[4:05:28] <akman14> LUL LUL LUL
[4:05:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah you still gotta remember to push that button
[4:05:28] <jackelzxaa> its just on the other side of this pit
[4:05:34] <akman14> Boomer woolie
[4:05:36] <jackelzxaa> i want to see the big ribbed penis
[4:05:38] <+BNPhone> Mere minutes away from Galunga too
[4:05:40] <+BNPhone> NotLikeThis
[4:05:41] <jackelzxaa> before stream end
[4:05:42] <Tsoulus> ok grandpa woolie
[4:05:47] <Lieutenant_America> Also I want to point out that the Tentacles here also have behaviors they don't in Blast Pit
[4:05:48] <+chvmpchange> wow
[4:05:49] <Twichty> woolie chceck if auto run is on
[4:05:52] <Lieutenant_America> Like the Bullsquids
[4:06:02] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America you gotta test it man. it's really bad in Black Mesa. Like two steps to the left and they miss
[4:06:03] <mattynezz> Wouldn't be having this problem with a keyboard....
[4:06:04] <%Javaa01> Well, like half the game
[4:06:05] <+huggablemantooth> dont use that spire it slows u down
[4:06:06] <%Javaa01> But yeah
[4:06:10] <major_gnuisance> Try jumping *before* the edge?
[4:06:12] <axiomthunder> i went a different way than woolie is going here
[4:06:13] <Tsoulus> yeah the spire is shit
[4:06:13] <+Rabbitmage> That spike looks too verticle
[4:06:14] <%Javaa01> Auto run is established
[4:06:18] <+mythboy99> PC game platforming can't handle 「The Hybrid」
[4:06:21] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I have 90 hours on this game
[4:06:32] <Lieutenant_America> And have done a lot of tweaking and combing over
[4:06:35] <+huggablemantooth> you cant jump from that spiike
[4:06:39] <%BinaryFireball> i believe I can fly
[4:06:45] <%BinaryFireball> I believe I can touch the skyyyyy
[4:06:47] <chickenhunter> what does auto run even do
[4:06:48] <major_gnuisance> From somewhere flat, them
[4:06:51] <major_gnuisance> *then
[4:06:53] <%Javaa01> @mythboy99 No, The Hybrid is incapable of handling PC platforming
[4:06:55] <+BNPhone> it auto runs
[4:06:58] <@Solidus_113> this is the right direction, you're just picking the wrong spots
[4:07:00] <+chvmpchange> it makes you sprint all the time
[4:07:00] <chickenhunter> doesnt look like it
[4:07:01] <Lieutenant_America> But the Tentacles here have idle behaviors they don't in Blast Pit
[4:07:08] <jackelzxaa> half life 2 doesnt have auto run or auto crouch jump
[4:07:09] <@Solidus_113> jump earlier than the edge
[4:07:13] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America i got 40, doesn't take that long to notice
[4:07:13] <Tsoulus> just go from the right of the spire
[4:07:13] <Lieutenant_America> So I hope they add those to Blast Pit in 1.5
[4:07:18] <Dekaccho> There's an alternate path you can take on your left.
[4:07:22] <TheMorilo> NotLikeThis
[4:07:27] <anne_arkie> the tentacles are shit talking your jumps in Morse code
[4:07:28] <+Rabbitmage> scum it out
[4:07:30] <akman14> Why did the devs even add this?
[4:07:30] <jackelzxaa> hybrid isn't set up to handle shift ctrl space dynamic is the problem woolie's gonna run into
[4:07:34] <%Haarute> double tap the jump, don't wait for the second
[4:07:40] <major_gnuisance> Edge geometry is fucked, apparently. Jump early from flat ground.
[4:07:42] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Look do you want me to compile a court case?
[4:07:47] <Man_F_Artwish> @lieutenant_america it’s probably intended they are different
[4:07:49] <+huggablemantooth> that is really weird
[4:07:50] <%Haarute> are you running into geometry?
[4:07:50] <EDFscout> do you hold forward?
[4:08:04] <+Balkespower> SAVE
[4:08:04] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America nah, i'm just saying try it next time you boot the game.
[4:08:04] <+chvmpchange> hold forward while you jump
[4:08:04] <%MaddyCaddy> At least you don't have to worry about it if you play the sequeals
[4:08:06] <+chvmpchange> the entire time
[4:08:10] <%Javaa01> Either the edge geo is weird, or your ungodly control method is fucking you
[4:08:12] <KeystoneA2> Gotta avoid fucky geometry, along with holding forward while you jump
[4:08:13] <Lieutenant_America> @Man_F_Artwish Yeah but in HL1 the Blast Pit Tentacles use the same idle behavior.
[4:08:14] <jackelzxaa> you actually go further if you double tap right away and not at the top of your jump
[4:08:21] <%Haarute> SAVE
[4:08:22] <mattynezz> Can you not just spam out all your dashes at once?
[4:08:23] <Lieutenant_America> They hear noise: they go berserk.

[4:09:12] <%aceleapc> SAVE THE GALUNGAS
[4:09:14] <major_gnuisance> Maybe Vorts were not as bad as we assumed???
[4:09:17] <%Javaa01> Start of 3 out of 4

[4:09:28] <major_gnuisance> Good stream!
[4:09:30] <%jiggy_snipe> those collars were mighty suspicious
[4:09:34] <EDFscout> WHOOEW
[4:09:36] <%Exiliator> I got here just in time to see the horrors of alien slavery
[4:09:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> "Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow."
[4:09:45] <Lieutenant_America> @LiquidDinosaur "This is more than anyone can bear, but we shall endure."
[4:09:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG SLAVE COLLARS FOR BIG GALUNGAS
[4:09:58] <@Solidus_113> you've been killing slaves all this time!
[4:09:59] <+BNPhone> the hour of chatting and 30 minutes of oopsing fucked us over
[4:10:01] <jackelzxaa> better to do interloper in one go than try to do all of xen in a row
[4:10:02] <%Skullgod> damn did i miss the stream
[4:10:03] <Tsoulus> look at this platformer
[4:10:04] <MattDemers> CUBE
[4:10:09] <jackelzxaa> interloper is alot
[4:10:20] <+Rabbitmage> FOOL
[4:10:23] <%MaddyCaddy> Yeah, there was no way
[4:10:24] <Lieutenant_America> Interloper is Surface Tension length
[4:10:25] <%Skullgod> Xen is about 4 hours
[4:10:27] <TheMorilo> FOOL
[4:10:28] <%natebud> Interloper is a stream
[4:10:29] <%Javaa01> You scratched the surface last time
[4:10:32] <Lieutenant_America> Just one big Finale Level
[4:10:34] <+BNPhone> it would have been possible but there were some.... hiccups
[4:10:36] <+DreyfussFrost> @woolieversus Fun fact: the world record HL1 speedrun clears the entirety of OG Xen in less than 4 minutes.
[4:10:38] <+shry7> !uptime
[4:10:38] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 25 minutes
[4:10:39] <Tsoulus> xen is long as SHIT
[4:10:44] <Lieutenant_America> Oof
[4:10:45] <jackelzxaa> black mesa xen is about as long as a full two expansion packs
[4:10:47] <Visorak6> Interloper is a really long chapter
[4:10:47] <%jiggy_snipe> oof
[4:10:49] <+TDotGoat> it's like 6pm!
[4:10:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> What time is it over there!?
[4:10:52] <anne_arkie> I remember Xen being like 1 hour in the original
[4:10:54] <%Haarute> MAYBE you could have if you were like a half-life expert, but not as a first time
[4:10:56] <EDFscout> eat some headcrabs yo
[4:10:58] <DesertPenguin> It's 5:40 pm
[4:10:58] <%jiggy_snipe> damn yall act like me lol
[4:10:58] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, if you did the rest you'd drop dead before hitting the credits
[4:11:01] <+Balkespower> 4 hours
[4:11:04] <Slimeking_Mike> This chapter will take you HOURS
[4:11:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DreyfussFrost did you see the recent speedrun of LP with Valve personell watching
[4:11:12] <Lieutenant_America> You're about to Storm the Castle
[4:11:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> You just took out someone's dog, basically.
[4:11:13] <jackelzxaa> the big girl was just the midboss
[4:11:14] <Tsoulus> it is the beginning of the end
[4:11:15] <+Balkespower> there is a big brain dude
[4:11:16] <BlkFlameKami> woolie needs breakfast in his highchair and jammies
[4:11:18] <Melchior_the_Wise> You'll probably beat it by next stream
[4:11:19] <anne_arkie> TestiCrab is not in fact the final boss
[4:11:25] <%The_Timo> You killed the big girl... for the head crabs... the weakest enemies in the game lol
[4:11:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> They're running.
[4:11:29] <jackelzxaa> you've been killing slave labor the whole game
[4:11:37] <%Javaa01> You've missed him every single time
[4:11:39] <%The_Timo> The boss of the jobbers
[4:11:39] <@Solidus_113> you might find out
[4:11:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> You missed him so many times while you've played.
[4:11:41] <%Haarute> don't worry about it
[4:11:44] <Tsoulus> he is Jeff Bezos
[4:11:45] <+chvmpchange> lol
[4:11:46] <%MaddyCaddy> I heard a theory or something where the host body becomes the ball sack after a headcrab has been on for a while
[4:11:47] <+Balkespower> that's what every HL fans is asking
[4:11:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> You'll find out
[4:11:50] <+DreyfussFrost> Gonarch's Lair in vanilla is 3 rooms.
[4:11:52] <+RueOrin> G-Man is in ever chapter except the Xen ones
[4:11:54] <%MaddyCaddy> Probably not credible though
[4:11:55] <Visorak6> Gman is not really explained until the end/2
[4:11:55] <+Balkespower> no clue what he is and what he wants
[4:11:56] <+Reverend_Roscoe> He's been there, you're just blind
[4:11:57] <%chiluzza> he just shows up if youre not looking around you lose him
[4:11:59] <+Balkespower> No.
[4:11:59] <%Vorga1339> That's 2
[4:11:59] <@Solidus_113> that's HL2
[4:11:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Half Life 2

[4:12:28] <NaturalGear> all of it?
[4:12:29] <Tsoulus> LUL
[4:12:30] <+Blackjackal95> the whole game?
[4:12:30] <jackelzxaa> i hope when woolie gets to 2 he gets set up with the good modernization mods

[4:12:38] <akman14> Memories:Unlocked
[4:12:39] <TheMorilo> THE WHOLE GAME?
[4:12:39] <%kyh9> G Man does show up in the tram in HL1
[4:12:40] <jackelzxaa> since it'll feel like a downgrade going from BM to HL2 vanilla
[4:12:43] <@Solidus_113> "the right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. Wake up Mr Freeman, wake up and smell the ashes."
[4:12:46] <EDFscout> REVELEATIONS
[4:12:47] <Lieutenant_America> I really hope Woolie does HL2 by the by
[4:12:48] <alrobot2014> but hl2 was 2004
[4:12:48] <%natebud> not quite, but ok
[4:12:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> G-Man only "TALKS TO YOU" in the end of HL1, and the beginning and end of HL2. otherwise its all cute cameos
[4:12:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> the truth come out
[4:12:52] <%Javaa01> G-Man shows up for a short bit during the tram ride in Half Life 1, but he's entirely missable
[4:12:55] <%Javaa01> And you did miss him
[4:12:57] <%aceleapc> that's not quite right
[4:13:02] <+Balkespower> that this is Woolie's first HL1 playthrough
[4:13:06] <%Haarute> i mean if he couldn't even tell it was 2 he doesn't know anything so
[4:13:07] <+Balkespower> technically
[4:13:07] <dukenux> Rise and Shine Mr Madden. Rise... and shine.
[4:13:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> he shows up in 1 and 2 as easter eggs
[4:13:09] <DukeBlack_> are ya wrapping up?
[4:13:11] <jackelzxaa> the missable gman scenes are all easter eggs
[4:13:14] <%Atomik456> I mean personally if woolie keeps this fps kick going id love to see a Serious Sam
[4:13:16] <jackelzxaa> the real stuff is mandatory
[4:13:19] <@SoushinSen> is Black Mesa beaten?
[4:13:22] <@Solidus_113> no
[4:13:22] <+BNPhone> no
[4:13:23] <alrobot2014> nope
[4:13:25] <%Atomik456> no
[4:13:26] <jackelzxaa> black mesa is one session away
[4:13:27] <%Javaa01> Hell no it's not
[4:13:31] <%MaddyCaddy> Dokapon baby
[4:13:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> there is no "lore" you missed other than "heres' a reminder he is still spying on you"
[4:13:38] <jackelzxaa> interloper is alot but as a single session should be doable
[4:13:46] <Visorak6> Next tuesday finale?
[4:13:47] <jackelzxaa> and then the thing after interloper is not a big deal
[4:13:56] <+BNPhone> a whole ass week? jesus
[4:14:02] <Lieutenant_America> I think Woolie will like Interloper, length aside. There's lots of cool moments.
[4:14:07] <@SoushinSen> dokapon Part 3 on youtube in 18 minutes!
[4:14:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> there's Interloper, a boss fight and then a "chapter" that's just the ending
[4:14:23] <jackelzxaa> woolies really going to like the stuff right after where he stopped
[4:14:29] <TheMorilo> But It's right there
[4:14:30] <%Javaa01> End Game is just the ending cutscene
[4:14:31] <+Trevelyan_Dovah> Only 3 more chapters
[4:14:33] <Man_F_Artwish> Interloper has the best elevator in a video game fight me
[4:14:35] <+xerotwo> PERSONA 5 ROYAL? doodStare
[4:14:36] <jackelzxaa> the culture stuff he's getting to is super interesting
[4:14:37] <+Rabbitmage> Chat loves to spoil everything
[4:14:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> If you were running a marathon, you're about 20 miles in
[4:14:43] <Lieutenant_America> Am I the only one who didn't think P5's Palace 7 was the end?
[4:14:45] <jackelzxaa> especially since he doesn't know about later plot stuff
[4:14:47] <+BNPhone> thats all on you
[4:14:54] <@Solidus_113> It miiiiiiight be 2 more streams, From here there's a whole lot of Platforming Puzzles, and difficult shooter sections
[4:14:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> You just killed a head crab mom, you killed a Goomba.
[4:15:10] <2deep5u> I wish P5 did the same thing as P3, changing the music during the last month
[4:15:11] <Lieutenant_America> Shouldn't be TWO
[4:15:16] <%Vorga1339> They made Xen long as fuck
[4:15:18] <%Javaa01> But yeah, there is a TRUE final boss in the game
[4:15:20] <jackelzxaa> interloper can be one stream but it MIGHT be 2 but i believe 1 is possible
[4:15:20] <Lieutenant_America> @Yolopimpswag It does
[4:15:22] <+Balkespower> So much cool shit interloper
[4:15:23] <+DreyfussFrost> You would have been done last session if it was vanilla HL1.
[4:15:26] <%Javaa01> Because that Gonarch fight was the warmup
[4:15:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lieutenant_america Remember to add the Woolie variable.
[4:15:27] <jackelzxaa> xen is more like the expansion pack
[4:15:28] <Visorak6> I really liked the use of verticality in xen
[4:15:30] <+Balkespower> even if it is a bit drawn out
[4:15:31] <%Haarute> black mesa xen is much longer too

[4:15:39] <%Atomik456> its act 3 yeah
[4:15:43] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus xen is bloodborne the old hunters
[4:15:44] <@Solidus_113> probably closer to 25%
[4:15:45] <TheMorilo> Shouldn't be two, but with the Woolie factor, it might be two other streams
[4:15:46] <2deep5u> @Lieutenant_America haven't played royal yet, but I don't remember vanilla P5 doing that
[4:15:46] <%MaddyCaddy> It used to be much shorter
[4:15:49] <%Vorga1339> @WoolieVersus CrowbarCollective made Xen huge for some reason, like everything you're seeing is original content compared to how brief it was in the original
[4:15:58] <+DreyfussFrost> OG Xen was 10%
[4:15:58] <%Javaa01> Everything after you leave the facility is Zen

[4:25:10] <+chvmpchange> woolie is such a combine sympathizer

[4:25:31] <+chvmpchange> exactly
[4:25:39] <@Menitta> we can use them to traverse pits!
[4:25:46] <jackelzxaa> woolie would be a combine with cyber dreads
[4:25:46] <+Balkespower> Combine may have Jetpacks. So Wolie is going to side with the Combine
[4:25:51] <+Balkespower> *woolie
[4:25:52] <jackelzxaa> combine have super jumps
[4:25:59] <@Menitta> Drink soda! it will help you see faster
[4:26:01] <jackelzxaa> not humongous ones
[4:26:02] <+chvmpchange> woolie has combine overwatch in his future
[4:26:05] <jackelzxaa> but they CAN do "jumps"
[4:26:14] <jackelzxaa> woolie will HATE breen tho

[4:26:39] <+PunJ0hn> The blood pool must get DEEPER

[4:27:09] <@Menitta> its pretty true
[4:27:11] <%BinaryFireball> ah that is too simple and makes too much sense @Solidus_113
[4:27:14] <EDFscout> Not anymore!
[4:27:18] <+chvmpchange> I think woolie would be super into the hl2 plot and characters
[4:27:18] <jackelzxaa> with the overwatch and shit
[4:27:19] <%chiluzza> they are terrified HL3 wont ever meet the fans expectations
[4:27:25] <Lieutenant_America> Imagine joining the fandom AFTER Epistle 3

[4:27:46] <%chiluzza> Hafl life Alyx is AMAZING
[4:27:49] <jackelzxaa> alyx makes it seem like we might get half life 3 but episode 3 won't happen
[4:27:50] <EDFscout> vry good
[4:27:51] <+thackattack00> Too bad most fans dont get to play
[4:27:54] <@akuda_bar> i think it's the nature of half life games to never have real clo HELLO GORDON
[4:27:57] <EDFscout> VRy good
[4:28:00] <%natebud> Woolie will like HL2, and he probably won't mind the slow walk and talk segments seeing them for the first time.
[4:28:01] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus it's a youtube series

[4:28:09] <Lieutenant_America> It's from a machinima
[4:28:10] <derap41> HELLO GORDON
[4:28:12] <kingmatthiaz> There's never too much salt
[4:28:15] <@Solidus_113> It's a recent meme from "half life VR with sentient AI"
[4:28:16] <+Balkespower> from "Half Life, but the A.I. is self-concious" @WoolieVersus
[4:28:22] <Lieutenant_America> Half-Life 1 in VR with roleplaying
[4:28:22] <%Teh_Un> Half Life with Self Aware AI
[4:28:26] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus it's not from VR it's from an LP of half life 1
[4:28:28] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus Please help me set my mind goblins to rest. What are your thoughts on gyro aiming on controllers?
[4:28:44] <+Balkespower> the complete package
[4:28:53] <%SirGO0SE> spillz chillz & shillz
[4:28:54] <EDFscout> gonad kills
[4:28:57] <+r0chelimit> The Peace Pool may end up causing even more vitriol just in a different direction
[4:29:22] <@Solidus_113> Gyro is something you have to get used to, but it works better than an analog at high-level play
[4:29:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> What game is the "Half-Life but the AI is sentient" filmed in? Is there a VR multipler mod of HL1?
[4:29:29] <%Exiliator> How much do I have to donate to have Woolie watch full-life consequences when he finally beats episode 2 LUL
[4:29:34] <%Javaa01> The gyro based aim finetuning on the Switch is a cool idea
[4:29:35] <%Prevot> gyro aiming is objectively superior
[4:29:36] <@Menitta> Gyro should be used in combination with a stick
[4:29:41] <%RioGascar> Gmod vr
[4:29:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:29:42] <%aceleapc> @LiquidDinosaur GMod
[4:29:49] <%RioGascar> its filmed in gmod with the vrmod
[4:29:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> okay yeah that makes sense
[4:29:51] <@Solidus_113> Splatoon does is great
[4:29:56] <+PunJ0hn> @WoolieVersus what about gyro aiming in the vein of Splatoon?
[4:30:07] <@Menitta> Didn't you really like Splatoon's?
[4:30:08] <SomersaultJustice> dat phone glare
[4:30:10] <Memdosu> reggie is dangerously close to blinding woolie lol
[4:30:11] <kingmatthiaz> Fight night round 3 for salty bets
[4:30:11] <+Balkespower> Did you watch "Freeman's Mind" at one point? If not you should. @WoolieVersus
[4:30:26] <%kyh9> Splatoon has god-tier gyro controls tbh
[4:30:39] <major_gnuisance> Gyro aiming was the one major redeeming quality of the Steam Controller. Were you aware of this?
[4:30:49] <%kyh9> It just works better than manual, tbh
[4:30:55] <%Prevot> star fox controls were always shit IMO
[4:31:02] <@Menitta> Star Fox Zero is a bad remake of Star Fox 64, a game they've already remade
[4:31:03] <kingmatthiaz> South Park 64 for salty bets....Damnit I'm trying 😂
[4:31:04] <powerprotoman> meanwhile splatton is perfect with gyro so no starfox did not clsoe the covnersation
[4:31:04] <DatAsuna> FPS are fine with it
[4:31:10] <DatAsuna> metroid prime is way better with it
[4:31:12] <+nintega010> I wanted a star fox assualt 2
[4:31:14] <%kyh9> You can turn on normal controls with Splatoon, but Gyro is just superior in my opinion
[4:31:23] <@Menitta> Metroid Prime is so much better with the wii controls
[4:31:28] <%ChoculaUltra> yo South Park 64 was hella underrated for a 64 shooter.
[4:31:29] <%Prevot> woolie once again choosing to stick with an inferior control scheme
[4:31:29] <@Menitta> absolutely
[4:31:34] <+Hunterv96> thats a gif reggie
[4:31:36] <+nintega010> gyro for shooters for me
[4:31:40] <%Javaa01> The Star Fox 64 remake on the 3DS still has the old controls
[4:31:45] <@Solidus_113> Gyro is fantastic for fine-tuned aiming that you can't normally do with a stick
[4:31:47] <%Exiliator> yeah in vr
[4:31:55] <%kyh9> The thing is that in Splatoon, you don't need absolute aim, so speed matters more than absolute steadiness
[4:31:55] <+chvmpchange> mouse shits on gyro any day
[4:32:00] <%The_Timo> Arms? Lol
[4:32:08] <jackelzxaa> mouse is ultimate aiming
[4:32:38] <%kyh9> @chvmpchange Agreed. In my book, it's Mouse > Controller with babby aim-assist > Gyro > Controller
[4:32:40] <+Brandon__Brando> I liked the gryo aim with small adjustments that hard to do on a stick
[4:32:40] <+nintega010> I would keep up with a mouse with gyro
[4:32:44] <+PunJ0hn> Controller using stick + gyro for coarse and fine aim can bridge the gap between controller vs kb+m
[4:32:45] <major_gnuisance> Just wondering if you're aware that gyro aiming on controllers can bring them to near-mouse precision. It complements the sticks when aiming. Very useful for PC FPS games.
[4:32:55] <thequickbrownrabbit> Anything that can be done with a button press doesnt need to be a full body motion but nintedos gotta sell those 80 dollar sticks tho
[4:32:56] <+chvmpchange> agreed
[4:32:58] <@Menitta> I think BOTW does aiming with gyro well. It uses both gyro and a stick
[4:33:02] <DatAsuna> oh god it is tuesday isn't it
[4:33:02] <SomersaultJustice> kotter
[4:33:14] <DatAsuna> big hype for tomorrow's episode
[4:33:15] <Zayasu> LUL
[4:33:19] <jackelzxaa> reggie's doing it
[4:33:22] <jackelzxaa> he's trying to
[4:33:22] <Jflaskd13> sounds beautiful
[4:33:30] <DatAsuna> I preemptively apologise for the lore dumps
