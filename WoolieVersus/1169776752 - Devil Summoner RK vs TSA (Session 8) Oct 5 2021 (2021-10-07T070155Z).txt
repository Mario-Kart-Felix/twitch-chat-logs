[0:01:52] <%DashXero> Smash is over. strangeYay
[0:01:56] <David_de_Bergerac> I think it's a fitting final character
[0:02:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> the fact that there are no new remix's or opening tracks proves it was a fucking hassle to get any music
[0:02:06] <andre11dr> I didn't even know it was Sora until now LUL
[0:02:08] <%Prevot> I wish it was a shittier character so I could at least feel something about it
[0:02:11] <IndoorSitup> Master Chief gets absolutely nothing.
[0:02:13] <%RyTYoung> Doom Guy being a Mii costume is pretty cool
[0:02:16] <+NopeBadguy> I appreciate that Sakurai referenced that Doom runs on everything
[0:02:18] <@Solidus_113> NOT A SINGLE DISNEY CHARACTER TO BE SEEN
[0:02:19] <$ggbhtg> Geno was delisted via Mii Costume, a while ago

[0:02:33] <andre11dr> I mean i don't care about Sora but that's fine, everyone wanted him
[0:02:33] <+Kyma1020> People are happy
[0:02:37] <Treasure_Vault> I wanted Sheriff, from Sheriff
[0:02:39] <+meniscate> No Trinity Final Smash so no
[0:02:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Travis... evoCry evoCry evoCry
[0:02:46] <David_de_Bergerac> they already advertised xbox enough with Banjo so I think they wanted to avoid that again
[0:02:47] <IndoorSitup> Master Chief gets fucking nothing.
[0:02:49] <%DashXero> I thought that was Bayo...?
[0:02:53] <+NopeBadguy> Democracy fails again Kappa
[0:02:54] <leith_aziz> hi chat
[0:02:55] <dds333a> I expected Sora
[0:02:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> sakurai said in the direct about how haaaard it was to get him in
[0:03:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> no bayo was just high in certain regions
[0:03:03] <leith_aziz> I'm happy about Sora
[0:03:05] <dromemer3> I wanted goofy!!!! LUL BibleThump BibleThump
[0:03:06] <Qsmash_> I knew there was no way Bayo won that poll
[0:03:09] <%NYCrownlessKing> but not overall
[0:03:09] <$ggbhtg> KH is kinda big
[0:03:10] <%DashXero> @NYCrownlessKing Ah. Thanks.
[0:03:12] <$ggbhtg> kinda sorta
[0:03:16] <leith_aziz> Even if you dont like it, it's in the heart of many people
[0:03:23] <leith_aziz> nicobLove nicobLove nicobLove nicobLove
[0:03:24] <leomuratore> It was a good choice.
[0:03:27] <andre11dr> Sakurai worked HARD to get Sora
[0:03:28] <%RyTYoung> I'm happy about it, it's a good sendoff I feel
[0:03:30] <@Solidus_113> This will never happen ever again
[0:03:36] <$ggbhtg> The Videogame Hall of Fame
[0:03:40] <dds333a> sonic and sega, yeah
[0:03:42] <%RyTYoung> Mac thinking it was Dark Souls was hilarious LUL
[0:03:43] <%NYCrownlessKing> you will never have a smash game where they regain the license for sora lol
[0:03:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 this is the last massive crossover game
[0:03:49] <dromemer3> when are we getting mario in smash????
[0:03:53] <%Prevot> square got like 3 chars in this dlc
[0:03:53] <%NYCrownlessKing> like hold onto that switch homie LUL
[0:04:07] <$ggbhtg> It's become The Videogame Hall of Fame
[0:04:15] <andre11dr> More of Smash budget gose into getting the caracter at this point then actually making them
[0:04:20] <dds333a> When it was the Nintendo Hall of fame
[0:04:22] <Blank9> and hero
[0:04:28] <%DashXero> @NYCrownlessKing In a couple of decades, we'll likely have to campaign to free Smash Ultimate...
[0:04:39] <+NopeBadguy> Did you ALSO think it was a Souls character at first
[0:04:43] <leith_aziz> Also, apparently if you count Pirhanna Plant and since Pyra/Mythra cout as seperate characters, Sora is the 13th DLC character, and his presentation is in 13 days
[0:04:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm personally sad there was no digimon rep
[0:04:52] <dromemer3> Smash is just the fancy mansion only select characters can go party. V.I.P only bitch!!!
[0:04:57] <@Solidus_113> The new Bamco logo sucks
[0:04:59] <$ggbhtg> When Nomura said "FF characters won't be involved in KH3 because the series has outgrown them", nearsighted as that was, he wasn't wrong.
[0:05:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> man fuck that new bamco logo
[0:05:12] <+faeron93> Its a celebration
[0:05:17] <Qsmash_> people have the habit of making imaginary rules for how characters get added in
[0:05:23] <dds333a> right
[0:05:34] <leith_aziz> Im not suprised about the new Bamco logo. Its the simplified logo trend
[0:05:35] <+NopeBadguy> @ggbhtg more that disney oversaturated its presence and pushed it out
[0:05:39] <andre11dr> Honestly they shouldn't stop, like why stop? Smash makes them so much money
[0:05:49] <dromemer3> Disney now rules the world!
[0:05:56] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Maybe, but that's Sakurai's decision
[0:06:00] <$ggbhtg> @NopeBadguy it's never a simple story with these things
[0:06:13] <+NopeBadguy> @ggbhtg money is a very simple story
[0:06:17] <$ggbhtg> They left A LOT of his combat options on the table
[0:06:18] <Blank9> down b counter
[0:06:22] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:06:24] <@Solidus_113> his air game is fucked up
[0:06:29] <%mr_sups> EWGF
[0:06:30] <leith_aziz> The input meme
[0:06:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's simple but fuck he's got the best recovery ever
[0:06:36] <dromemer3> Terry Bogard is that shit son!!!
[0:06:38] <leomuratore> LUL
[0:06:41] <%RyTYoung> Sora looks like the biggest edge guarding character I've ever seen, he has so many tools
[0:06:44] <dds333a> no extra commands LUL
[0:06:49] <leith_aziz> I didnt get Sol in Smash, but damn is Terry hype
[0:06:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> sora has to up b's
[0:06:53] <leith_aziz> nicobEZ
[0:07:04] <+NopeBadguy> he's also the lightest character in the game so get ready to watch him die outright @WoolieVersus
[0:07:06] <%DashXero> He can up-B into side-B
[0:07:08] <+cermo55> simple and clean
[0:07:15] <%RaziWraith> AnOtHeR AnImE SwoRD FiGhTeR LUL
[0:07:20] <$ggbhtg> Very safe choices for his moveset, a bit too safe, really, compared to what he can do
[0:07:26] <@Solidus_113> Ike is about to swing his ass off the stage
[0:07:35] <+NopeBadguy> @ggbhtg it felt very much like kh1 mostly
[0:07:40] <%RyTYoung> I was satisfied with the roster when they added Joker, anything else they added didn't bother me
[0:07:42] <leith_aziz> That stage is fantastic in terms of polish and EFFORT
[0:07:42] <dds333a> @cermo55 LUL
[0:07:46] <+NopeBadguy> it's very much kh1 sora
[0:07:47] <dromemer3> So sora is a super safe. fuxk it were done character BibleThump

[0:08:58] <+kyosukeneo89> Mario had to call in the mob but he got him
[0:09:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> the ff14 producer is on record as saying "yeah getting sora in ff14 isn't worth the hassle"
[0:09:06] <dromemer3> isn't sora technically dead right now in his story???
[0:09:09] <leomuratore> Doom Slayer Mii costume was a nice surprise
[0:09:12] <dds333a> always has been
[0:09:27] <leith_aziz> @dromemer3 He's in a different world now. I guess this is teh canon taht he went to Smash
[0:09:30] <%RyTYoung> @leith_aziz not for a long time, they will give it a 5+ year gap from now til the next gane

[0:12:49] <badguy8312> Smash Ultimate: For Real This Time

[0:12:56] <%RyTYoung> Sakurai said in Harata's talk show that he feels he has to keep making games for as long as he can, but I don't think that means he has to work on Smash for as long as he can, he is definitely done imo
[0:12:57] <@Solidus_113> Sakurai is done
[0:13:08] <+Coolkevinator> 2014
[0:13:18] <Brandon__Brando> can you even resell this game later on with all these IP's?
[0:13:20] <leith_aziz> @RyTYoung Maybe he wants to work on Kid Icarus again
[0:13:37] <dromemer3> STOP POSTING ABOUT SMASH!!!
[0:13:38] <+pupil31> I think it's gonna get the Mario Kart 8 treatment BibleThump
[0:13:39] <dds333a> absolutely
[0:13:46] <nintega010> like max said what director is gonna want to try to make smash after this
[0:13:48] <rosemon5001> they will port it to the next gen(if they make it in that time)
[0:13:49] <$ggbhtg> Sakurai's gonna kick the door down in 3 years with A NEW IP

[0:14:03] <$ggbhtg> Sakurai's gonna kick the door down on the universe, in 3 years with A NEW IP

[0:14:10] <miucsa51> galactus that shit
[0:14:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Is Smash just a metaphor for Kirby's hunger?

[0:15:18] <Treasure_Vault> Will it still have the starting 64 lineup?
[0:15:23] <miucsa51> Smash Rpg
[0:15:27] <%RyTYoung> It just becomes Power Stones NotLikeThis
[0:15:28] <dds333a> soft reboot levels?
[0:15:29] <andre11dr> People will be disappointed no matter what, if they don't continue supporting Ultimate
[0:15:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> As long as they keep the belmonts, or falcon, I'm fine
[0:15:31] <$ggbhtg> Again, if anyone wants to know more about Sakurai, PLEASE consider watching Harada's Bar, where he was on as a guest.
[0:15:33] <badguy8312> Sakurai defects to nicktoons
[0:15:33] <leith_aziz> New genre maybe?
[0:15:35] <SivSarcast> Reject Ultimate, Return to Melee.
[0:15:35] <Diabetic> It's gonna wind up being the F-Zero Paradox, everyone wants a new game, but Nintendo won't do it until they can make something new
[0:15:38] <leomuratore> Smash Bros Next
[0:15:40] <leith_aziz> Smash RPG
[0:15:42] <Viewtiful_Rose> I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna happen.
[0:15:49] <dds333a> It becomes like Custom Robo Kappa
[0:15:51] <linSP> Smash Emblem
[0:15:53] <miucsa51> fuck it make nintendo hearts might as well
[0:15:53] <$ggbhtg> Smash: The NeXt
[0:15:53] <Qsmash_> Sonic Next (old name for Sonic 06)
[0:16:01] <%DashXero> If they do, I'm done.
[0:16:02] <%Valask> ALL FIRE EMBLEM
[0:16:07] <Viewtiful_Rose> I think smash is too iconic if they change it too much people will be mad
[0:16:41] <leith_aziz> Can Nintendo keep reselling Smash Ultimate in the future considering all the licenses?
[0:16:41] <+pupil31> Pokken Tournament but with Smash Characters
[0:16:42] <MayorRev> Sakurai can finally go back to kirby games
[0:16:50] <+NYCrownlessKing> make it Smash Bros.. KART
[0:16:54] <$ggbhtg> Thing 1 and Thing 2
[0:17:06] <%townzzzzz> smash bros the card game
[0:17:12] <Blank9> just be modern smash
[0:17:13] <%Seancicle> avec recull. üôåüèª
[0:17:13] <andre11dr> I think this is just the peak of Smash, enjoy it while you can
[0:17:18] <Blank9> only new game reps
[0:17:23] <%NYCrownlessKing> you either just importing ultimate and never make a new game.
[0:17:31] <andre11dr> This is not something that will be reached again
[0:17:31] <DracaenaLeaf> Nintendo Kart
[0:17:33] <badguy8312> just reinvent the wheel but make it better than any wheel, easy
[0:17:36] <leith_aziz> I get Reggie. End on a high note
[0:17:47] <Viewtiful_Rose> I‚Äôm curious who the fuck they decide to keep and leave behind. There‚Äôs so many cool new characters
[0:17:47] <leith_aziz> I feel like its too late for online
[0:17:57] <+pupil31> Amen
[0:17:58] <NickWearsGlasses> @mayorrev he doesn't do those anymore though
[0:18:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> they will NEVER have good online
[0:18:03] <%ThePizzaLovingTurtle> Better online would be godlike Kreygasm
[0:18:11] <%Valask> @badguy8312 the problem is there is a shape that's actually bettern than wheels OpieOP
[0:18:12] <Blank9> rollback netcode the final dlc character
[0:18:15] <andre11dr> If they make the online good that's honestly godlike
[0:18:17] <MKII> they'd have to reboot it and sacrifice the roster for rollback
[0:18:17] <Diabetic> Thing is though, they do it, make a new game, add new characters, even those guys are gonna be like "Man I wish X character was in Ultimate"
[0:18:22] <Brandon__Brando> thats a amazing Idea. thats never going to happan
[0:18:30] <Wahrow> Nintendo knows how to end franchises, look at F-Zero
[0:18:38] <Brandon__Brando> so nick allstars
[0:18:44] <leith_aziz> I never owned a Nintendo console, but isnt Nintendo online generally bad?
[0:18:51] <Viewtiful_Rose> @wahrow smash is too big to kill
[0:18:58] <%Prevot> smash is not one of these games
[0:19:00] <Viewtiful_Rose> They would never
[0:19:04] <%ThePizzaLovingTurtle> @leith_aziz Their online is not great, yeah.
[0:19:10] <leith_aziz> Arcsys did with +R when those modders were putting work. It can happen
[0:19:13] <SivSarcast> The Nintendosaurus is too large to dislodge!
[0:19:17] <andre11dr> The problem is that the console itself doesn't support good online, and it's fucking Nintendo, they don't even know what rollback is
[0:19:20] <dds333a> @leith_aziz it's abysmally low on their list of priorities
[0:19:24] <Brandon__Brando> and then I woke up from my dream
[0:19:25] <$ggbhtg> Copium Supreme
[0:19:32] <Viewtiful_Rose> Nintendo would rather die than hire Fizzi
[0:19:35] <+faeron93> Sora was technically a unicorn
[0:19:35] <MayorRev> I think there's a tourney mode in smash ultimate?
[0:19:35] <dds333a> fuck, Wii online was a nightmare LUL
[0:19:37] <%Seancicle> skooku2Coffee
[0:19:42] <Viewtiful_Rose> They hate slippi with a passion
[0:20:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> ya Kirby Automata
[0:20:01] <badguy8312> I don't think Nintendo wants to address the possibility of a Heated Gamer Moment with their name in the background
[0:20:06] <leith_aziz> Nintendo hates emulation, so Slippi is such a nightmare
[0:20:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> sakurai has sacrificed years on his life for smash
[0:20:18] <andre11dr> Nintendo still use fax machines, they're NOT implementing rollbac LUL
[0:20:22] <Viewtiful_Rose> I‚Äôm mainly bummed that Doom Guy got relegated to a Mii costume
[0:20:24] <%NYCrownlessKing> it was like holding on to iwata last wish, like dont give out the poll.
[0:20:36] <%bahookery> 7

[0:20:50] <dds333a> here you are
[0:20:51] <%Valask> don't
[0:20:57] <+EmoCochino> that actualy happeded already with brawl
[0:20:58] <leith_aziz> @Viewtiful_Rose Wouldnt it be hype that he actually made it in the game? At least its not like Dante which somehow felt worse
[0:21:00] <%Valask> what if he fucking DIES
[0:21:12] <linSP> Let sakurai rest!
[0:21:15] <leith_aziz> Let the man rest in a living way
[0:21:19] <Wahrow> Sakurai made it so that he can't come back, he wrote himself out of reality
[0:21:21] <Viewtiful_Rose> @leith_aziz I feel like his move set would be way more interesting than Sora
[0:21:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> loool
[0:21:32] <Viewtiful_Rose> Sora feels kinda half baked design wise

[0:23:05] <leith_aziz> And I havent finished 2018 cause I want it on PC
[0:23:14] <%Valask> the older games were so good duuuuude
[0:23:16] <badguy8312> @leith_aziz you mean the psp game?
[0:23:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus you watched the cutscenes
[0:23:21] <andre11dr> He didn't play 2018 he watched it
[0:23:40] <leith_aziz> All of them are fun. I'm not sure on deciding which I like the most
[0:23:41] <andre11dr> I never played the prequel ones
[0:23:43] <dds333a> @badguy8312 there's a mobile game too
[0:23:49] <leith_aziz> @badguy8312 GOW Betrayalk
[0:23:50] <dds333a> a side scroller
[0:23:59] <linSP> Never forget, kratos wanted to do it but he didn‚Äôt
[0:24:09] <badguy8312> how long is it?
[0:24:19] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr If you have to choose one of the PSP, I recommend Ghost of SParta
[0:24:34] <dds333a> @linsp all those innocent people don't matter, but my family tho
[0:24:45] <andre11dr> That is not enough
[0:24:52] <%Valask> If you plan to play older GoW's, maybe don't go to the PSP because they're a bit weird
[0:24:57] <andre11dr> There where over 100 episodes
[0:25:01] <%Seancicle> sysphian
[0:25:06] <leith_aziz> @Valask There's a PS3 remaster version
[0:25:12] <%Valask> oh yeah I forgot
[0:25:18] <leith_aziz> Otherwise, yeah the controlls are a bit weird
[0:25:30] <dds333a> wow
[0:25:34] <andre11dr> "You're black"
[0:26:00] <terry_irvin> FACTS
[0:26:03] <%Valask> is this... Gundam shit?

[0:26:09] <andre11dr> Oh shit
[0:26:11] <terry_irvin> IT FUCKS
[0:26:12] <dds333a> @valask hell yeah
[0:26:12] <$ggbhtg> a Ready to Serve take
[0:26:14] <Blank9> gouf custom rules
[0:26:17] <%Lion_kun> 8th MS was fantastic
[0:26:23] <jack_s1n> 8th ms is not great but she is
[0:26:26] <+vaderxyz1970> It's a nice guesdolf
[0:26:27] <SivSarcast> Yeah Gundam Vietnam is very cool.
[0:26:28] <okramv> I hated 8th MS
[0:26:32] <leith_aziz> Gundam...Vitenam nicobStare nicobStare nicobStare
[0:26:34] <Blank9> 08th MS is gundam but romeo and juliet and vietnam war
[0:26:34] <+NopeBadguy> my man came out with chocolate ice cream and said "yo this is hot"
[0:26:34] <%Valask> Give me Gundam but Afghanistan
[0:26:36] <okramv> too overhyped
[0:26:38] <badguy8312> that sounds like extra PTSD
[0:26:39] <%Lion_kun> 8th MS felt like Metal Slug
[0:26:39] <+NopeBadguy> like "this is cold but delicious"
[0:26:39] <%Valask> that's what I want
[0:26:53] <badguy8312> @valask 00 Gundam exists
[0:26:58] <jack_s1n> only the setting of 8th ms team is cool
[0:27:00] <$ggbhtg> "What if war....but robots?" Thanks Geoff.
[0:27:01] <%Valask> u wot
[0:27:03] <Blank9> it's all about grunts
[0:27:03] <andre11dr> 8 MS is cool because you get to see what on foot combat looks like
[0:27:11] <jack_s1n> the story is god awful
[0:27:34] <badguy8312> @nopebadguy what the hell is this name???
[0:27:36] <%Lion_kun> 8th MS is great
[0:27:43] <Blank9> war in the pocket is another fun take
[0:27:49] <andre11dr> My problem with 8 MS is that i don't really care about the girl, i wish he just killed her
[0:27:51] <Blank9> for the holidays
[0:28:03] <dds333a> LUL
[0:28:05] <$ggbhtg> y'all play video games?
[0:28:09] <$ggbhtg> couldn't be me
[0:28:17] <SivSarcast> I'd say 08th MS Team is Gundam without the goofy space magic. That's how I'd put it.
[0:28:17] <leith_aziz> What did he/she say?
[0:28:24] <dds333a> reminds me of uni LUL
[0:28:29] <%mr_sups> Oooooffff
[0:28:42] <$ggbhtg> @leith_aziz Grad School is time consuming, basically.
[0:28:46] <andre11dr> My favorite Gundam is still 0083
[0:28:48] <%Lion_kun> The girl was sweet and endearing. I felt bad for her and how she was basically a prisoner for her brother's twisted ambitions

[0:31:01] <Brandon__Brando> if everyone is saying do it its already too late
[0:31:10] <$ggbhtg> Plus I do respect the upfront nature.
[0:31:15] <leith_aziz> I dont know what I'd do in that situation as the teacher
[0:31:16] <andre11dr> Learn this thing that only works here ,i hope you don't plan on moving
[0:31:18] <%Valask> @leith_aziz things might look grim, but by the time you graduate, life will be different. Make sure you think hard about what you're gonna do, do your research.

[1:41:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[1:41:08] <+vaderxyz1970> He just wants to dance and love you Woolie
[1:41:35] <Qu1ckyyy> Kaiser?
[1:41:45] <+froduck42> Yup it's in fallout new vegas
[1:41:46] <%ZweihanderSteve> i love kaiser salad
[1:41:48] <%illtima> CHINgeez more like
[1:41:50] <JetpackMcQuack> only if you're pedantic
[1:41:51] <andre11dr> Caesar
[1:42:02] <Daxalog> Chungus Khan
[1:42:02] <QueequegTheater> I like how Woolie still pronounced Julius Caesar wrong
[1:42:03] <+meniscate> Chungus
[1:42:04] <OblivionSword1> Chungus Khan
[1:42:06] <taeko_ohnuki> big chungus?
[1:42:14] <dds333a> what about  Dischingis Kappa
[1:42:17] <QueequegTheater> Yuleeus Kaisar
[1:42:17] <%mr_sups> KAI-SAR
[1:42:20] <plainsongz> big chungus Khan PogChamp
[1:42:34] <andre11dr> It's definitely Chungus Kappa
[1:42:41] <OblivionSword1> both Kaisar and Caesar are correct
[1:42:55] <JetpackMcQuack> Your language is dead, get over it
[1:42:58] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus In Latin J is pronounced Y and C is always pronounced K
[1:43:07] <%mr_sups> KAI-us Yul-i-us KAI-sar
[1:43:16] <%Lion_kun> Julius Kaisar Zeppelli
[1:43:31] <%ozzrabbit> Says the guy that mispronounced Father Gascoigne
[1:43:32] <2deep5u> yeah, it's kaisar, that's why Kaiser in German is said  the way it is said, as a word descending from caesar.
[1:43:37] <%mr_sups> Gzar
[1:43:49] <QueequegTheater> I actually took four years of Latin, I count as an authority
[1:43:56] <+meniscate> kyeblade
[1:43:57] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, how could i forget about Gasqweeeee
[1:44:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> who cares how to pronounce it, can he make a salad or not
[1:45:01] <%Lion_kun> WHAT?!?!
[1:45:01] <OblivionSword1> both are correct but Kaisar just more fun to say
[1:45:08] <+pupil31> LUL
[1:45:09] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:45:27] <%ChoculaUltra> its been Little Kaisar's Pizza this whole time monkaS
[1:45:28] <Wingsofdarkness2> "Gascoinge"
[1:45:39] <andre11dr> That's just the lantin way to pronounce it
[1:45:46] <%mr_sups> Soft C in english is 'ssss'. Soft C in Italian is 'Ch'
[1:45:57] <Qu1ckyyy> Damn later Fusion is so much better, where you can go with result first.
[1:46:02] <+meniscate> dickboss
[1:46:13] <Qu1ckyyy> I can't wait to see how fusion will be in SMTV
[1:46:34] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy I can't either
[1:46:49] <Qu1ckyyy> This will be the longest month ever
[1:46:52] <andre11dr> Hopefully it's just the P5 system where you just pick the skills you want
[1:46:57] <dds333a> also, fusion is different in here even by normal standards

[1:47:24] <dds333a> @andre11dr thats been around since Devil survivor
[1:48:51] <%ChoculaUltra> dad demon
[1:48:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:48:51] <Qu1ckyyy> Couldn't you skip the fusion animation in 1 or is it just in 2? I remember if you pressed Start in the startup it would skip it.
[1:49:02] <dds333a> you can skip it in both LUL
[1:49:16] <Qu1ckyyy> oh
[1:49:26] <andre11dr> That's one old dick
[1:49:40] <dds333a> @andre11dr LUL
[1:50:46] <andre11dr> Uh, i hate when the late game demons look dumb
[1:51:15] <dds333a> I love it personally, I love when they vary LUL
[1:51:28] <Wingsofdarkness2> HotPokket
[1:52:24] <%ZweihanderSteve> its culturally relevant! some ass hole went "this god has eight legs and eats horses" and everyone just rolled with it
[1:53:22] <dds333a> patented R.E.G system
[1:53:48] <%mr_sups> "Government by Assassination "
[1:54:13] <dds333a> always taciturn this guy
[1:54:30] <dds333a> Also, a satellite launch about 27 years too early LUL
[1:54:37] <andre11dr> The emperor probably doesn't even know that there's evil demons everywhere
[1:54:39] <dds333a> *26
[1:54:52] <Wingsofdarkness2> big alt
[1:55:37] <dds333a> they would look like ufo's completely
[1:55:45] <%illtima> Like a story of a woman who found Yuri Gagarin's landing pod and he was needlessly obscure and freaked her out
[1:56:15] <andre11dr> Well if you found one out that probably means they don't work LUL
[1:56:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:57:13] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:57:42] <Wingsofdarkness2> im not to familiar with smt but i wish the demons had some more judeochristian designs i know its japanese culture but itd be nice
[1:57:51] <%brisk_dacat> Put it to his dome and pull the trigger.
[1:58:06] <andre11dr> I remember when German Spy heard that sound , he fucking died LUL
[1:58:07] <Qu1ckyyy> @Wingsofdarkness2 There are a lot like that in SMTIV
[1:58:17] <dds333a> @wingsofdarkness2 you're in luck, a few are out there
[1:58:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Kappa
[1:58:48] <dds333a> He's hated the Navy the entire game LUL
[1:58:58] <+vaderxyz1970> He's not wrong
[1:59:09] <dds333a> true LUL
[1:59:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what does muted do in this?
[1:59:32] <andre11dr> Just blocks spells
[1:59:37] <+vaderxyz1970> Airplanes are what sunk the Yamato
[1:59:42] <dds333a> Raidou simply can't confine new demons
[1:59:53] <dds333a> @andre11dr as well as this for demons
[2:00:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh that's not bad then
[2:00:29] <dds333a> @cobalt_phoenix_ completely negligible if you aren't confining anything yeah LUL
[2:01:31] <dds333a> in games that use voth HP and MP as a resource, mute cancels Magic, but not Physical, so a physical character isn't bothered either, and it might cure itself by New Moon
[2:01:59] <PanicSwytch> Woolie got me to play Nocturne and boy is it rough but im half way and really liking it
[2:02:16] <dds333a> Woolz got it SeemsGood

[2:04:31] <+fetrigon> fuck it
[2:04:44] <dds333a> don't worry, he stepped for a bit Kappa
[2:04:56] <andre11dr> That makes no sense
[2:05:14] <+pupil31> monkaS
[2:05:16] <dds333a> At least Rakshasa DOES have a standing animation LUL
[2:05:26] <andre11dr> He used the force threw his feet ,don't worry about it
[2:05:29] <Daxalog> ONE GUy

[2:07:45] <andre11dr> Don't worry, you'll get encounters every 5 seconds, you will get those levels
[2:08:24] <Wingsofdarkness2> yoooo i just looked up smt 4 demons medusa looks fucking sick
[2:08:50] <Daxalog> Got any flame bullets?
[2:08:56] <dds333a> Cerberus is a dog PunOko
[2:08:59] <andre11dr> @wingsofdarkness2 You should look up the angels
[2:09:05] <+LandOfTheWay> smt4's a mixed bag when it comes to demon designs, but i fucking love minotaur, astaroth, and satan
[2:09:24] <dds333a> @daxalog gott be the property in question
[2:10:00] <andre11dr> @landoftheway I'm actually not a fan of that version of Satan, i prefer the snake one
[2:10:27] <Wingsofdarkness2> i saw barbatos she looked sick 2 but the medusa design might be the best medusa ever
[2:11:00] <Qu1ckyyy> Doi has some amazing designs especially now in SJR and SMTV but some of his angels ones are overdesigned
[2:11:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[2:11:03] <dds333a> @wingsofdarkness2 Barbatos is a different demon, but I get you LUL
[2:11:25] <Qu1ckyyy> I much prefer the old Archangels designs rather than the SMTIV ones
[2:11:47] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy HARD agree
[2:11:49] <andre11dr> The old Archangels are just dudes tho
[2:11:56] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr i don't think there's anything wrong with kaneko's og design, but i really like the newer one as a way of mixing imagery of both the beat of revelation and satan trapped within the 9th circle in the divine comedy
[2:12:03] <Wingsofdarkness2> im refering to the character that says shes gods chariot or watever
[2:12:04] <andre11dr> The one in IV are actually scary looking
[2:12:06] <dds333a> Conversely, I like both Satans
[2:12:36] <mememixtape> i thought the IV archangels was designed by the power ranger/kamen rider dude
[2:12:47] <mememixtape> like koga saburo
[2:12:50] <+LandOfTheWay> @memeWALLmixtape they were
[2:13:21] <andre11dr> I do like that the new Satan design actually make use of the seven headed dragon thing
[2:13:21] <Qu1ckyyy> @andre11dr They are "Be not afraid" yes but I can't understand what the hell I am looking at, which is canon in lore but I'd much prefer to understand the demon I use.
[2:13:31] <dds333a> the ship's gone :O
[2:14:10] <+LandOfTheWay> honestly i really dislike the smt4 archangels, cause they just look like overdesigned messes. even if we're going for an eldritch angel look something like kaneko's seraph did it much better
[2:14:13] <andre11dr> @qu1ckyyy I like when something is so weird that i don't understand it
[2:14:23] <andre11dr> It's like Lovecraft
[2:14:42] <dds333a> Also, Mishaguji probably saved Woolie right there LUL
[2:14:57] <andre11dr> But you they are very overdesign to be fair
[2:15:29] <dds333a> Also, yeah. Doi only redrew Lucifer and Merkabah, they were designed by other guest artists, such as Yasushi Nirasawa
[2:16:03] <Qu1ckyyy> Lucifer was also kinda weird, with his pregnant hand
[2:16:11] <andre11dr> But at least where having a conversation about it as opposed to Lucifer who objectively looks like shit in IV
[2:16:21] <+LandOfTheWay> i feel like doi's really been hampered by atlus, cause i like a lot of his concept art a lot more than the designs that were implemented in-game
[2:16:50] <andre11dr> And they seem to agree, because SMT V is just the Kaneko design again
[2:16:51] <dds333a> Lucifer was even worse than normal in SMT IV LUL demon looked like shit. and hikaru wasn't even blonde Kappa
[2:17:29] <Qu1ckyyy> Wasn't Hikaru blonde brown?

[2:17:49] <dds333a> @andre11dr exactly although the fact that game is not connected to anything else as they usually are is the effect excuse
[2:18:11] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy nah, full brunette
[2:18:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:18:41] <andre11dr> @dds333a But they kept some of the other designs from IV
[2:18:49] <Wingsofdarkness2> brunettes are underrated
[2:18:51] <Qu1ckyyy> @dds333a Guess it would be too obvious if a blonde japanese girl was under there, so they wanted to keep it as a twist maybe
[2:19:11] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy right
[2:19:33] <andre11dr> Like I'm glad they kept the IV version of Odin ,never liked Purple dude with spear and dipper
[2:19:39] <+fetrigon> YEEEAAAH
[2:19:42] <Qu1ckyyy> WWWWWUAAAAHHUU
[2:19:43] <dds333a> @andre11dr true, but I'm saying that the fact that it's separate is just an excuse they can make
[2:19:53] <%townzzzzz> is it the lips
[2:19:59] <Wingsofdarkness2> summer lesson style foreign aryan super princess
[2:20:21] <dds333a> @andre11dr Debisama Odin is good enough, much less soul Hackers Odin
[2:20:39] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr classic odin was pretty weak, but while i don't dislike ultraman odin i still think his soul hackers design is best
[2:20:40] <+pupil31> BRATATATA
[2:21:55] <dds333a> Susy's back
[2:22:06] <andre11dr> I remember those guys being OP as hell in the sequel
[2:22:25] <andre11dr> I think they where the only demons that did gun damage
[2:22:53] <dds333a> Vanilla Kappa
[2:23:26] <Daxalog> is Mishaguji based on something?
[2:23:40] <dds333a> @daxalog hmmmmm Kappa
[2:24:00] <dds333a> exactly LUL
[2:24:03] <andre11dr> Yeah, his from Japanese folklore
[2:24:10] <OblivionSword1> @Daxalog shinto ancient god Mishaguji
[2:24:33] <dds333a> There's also an extremely small amount of info for Mishaguji, speaking seriously
[2:24:35] <OblivionSword1> from the suwa region
[2:24:52] <mememixtape> hey it's the big guy that fucked up the dude on nintendo treehouse
[2:24:54] <dds333a> He was particularly only really worshipped within Suwa
[2:25:06] <dds333a> @oblivionsword1 yeah. exactly
[2:25:18] <+LandOfTheWay> mishaguji was a pre-yamato god of sexual intercourse according to the smt wiki, so that probably explains the appearance
[2:25:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:25:28] <OblivionSword1> tbh I only knew Mishaguji from Touhou
[2:25:29] <andre11dr> I know his connected with rivers and his the protector of certain shrines
[2:25:29] <BurdRightsActivist> SRHINK THAT MODEL
[2:25:36] <Wingsofdarkness2> LUL
[2:25:40] <dds333a> @memewallmixtape that was Ubelluris, and im6not sure which is the reskin
[2:25:43] <Daxalog> Huh. Neat.
[2:26:17] <Qu1ckyyy> I love that demons are their actual model sizes in V
[2:26:23] <dds333a> I'm almost certain Ubelluris came first, but it's like Vetala and Nalagiri
[2:26:29] <mememixtape> only iof they aint on your side
[2:26:35] <dds333a> Although vetala has a different design
[2:26:45] <dds333a> at times
[2:26:57] <mememixtape> i think someone showed that fanir was smaller on nahobino's side then if he was on the enemy side
[2:27:02] <mememixtape> *fafnir
[2:27:04] <Wingsofdarkness2> its weird that 5 is being branded as a hair physics game
[2:27:07] <BurdRightsActivist> @Qu1ckyyy Don't you wish this was the case for pokemon? ):
[2:27:17] <+fetrigon> fuuuuuck november 11 can't come soon enough
[2:27:29] <dds333a> Colosseum Wailord. oh man, I wish
[2:27:30] <Qu1ckyyy> @memeWALLmixtape Yeah it would be difficult to have them on your party I guess, it's acceptable
[2:28:35] <dds333a> Bullet from Woolie's Valentine LUL
[2:28:55] <mememixtape> @Qu1ckyyy it's wild that even with gigantamax and true-to-size wailord in the wild area they STILL shrink down for the actual battles
[2:29:02] <Wingsofdarkness2> pls no bullet
[2:29:04] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:29:10] <+pupil31> monkaS
[2:29:11] <andre11dr> They can't have the demons be full size in this because they have to be able follow you on the map, and they probably don't want Beelzebub clipping threw everything
[2:29:23] <penitentpendant> He dumb
[2:29:24] <mememixtape> oh my god?
[2:29:31] <mememixtape> that's amazing
[2:29:34] <Qu1ckyyy> But a car that blocks the whole view is fine, I love it
[2:30:07] <dds333a> oh yeah LUL
[2:30:47] <Qu1ckyyy> Hit him more, he loves it
[2:30:52] <dds333a> combo'd

[2:36:13] <dds333a> Firm Kappa
[2:36:26] <Daxalog> As opposed to normal bullets
[2:36:44] <BurdRightsActivist> -ELEPHANT SOUNDS-
[2:37:16] <mememixtape> i spent way to long to find the bullet that only hurts your true love comic
[2:37:41] <andre11dr> Death bullets, as opposed to the other non death bullets LUL
[2:37:51] <Daxalog> I just want the song to say "One more god rejected"
[2:37:53] <dds333a> yeah, in addition to the standard Mind family of ailments that this franchise has, this game has ailments for every element that has marginal differences
[2:38:20] <dds333a> I use the word "ailment" generously
[2:38:31] <alladinbread> ello governor
[2:38:37] <lonosis47> sora is literally the most wanted character in any fighting game EVER. woolies reaction: nah. lmao gtfo
[2:38:48] <mememixtape> "NOW WE ARE POOR AGAIN!" - A Lesson is Learned but the Damage is Irreversible - posted on August 2004, so happy late 17th birthday to that

[2:39:04] <X2Eliah> @lonosis47 Literally what did you expect, it's woolie.
[2:39:04] <alladinbread> sora was kinda underwhelming should have been waluigi
[2:39:19] <+fetrigon> @x2eliah I believe he's trolling
[2:39:24] <Daxalog> Anitons?
[2:39:29] <dds333a> Dogu boy
[2:39:31] <%mr_sups> Pal World I think
[2:39:35] <lonosis47> you're right i should always expect less when it comes to wools @X2Eliah
[2:39:39] <Daxalog> Oh Palworld. The newer one.
[2:39:41] <%mr_sups> The Pokemon Slave labot game
[2:39:43] <andre11dr> @dds333a Yeah, not a fan of the weird lyrics in Nocturne?
[2:39:51] <Wingsofdarkness2> pokemon are basically demons
[2:39:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[2:39:56] <alladinbread> isn't that a digimon
[2:39:56] <dds333a> @andre11dr no
[2:40:17] <mememixtape> do NOT hit it with phys
[2:40:33] <andre11dr> @dds333a Yeah me neither, they are cool for the first 3 hours but they get annoying fast
[2:40:36] <dds333a> Like Nebiros, this is another sub-boss with a gimmick
[2:40:41] <srv4254> yea hes blue
[2:40:46] <mememixtape> yeah he's usually blue
[2:41:12] <dds333a> and he's weak to phys, this time around
[2:41:22] <ExpressNode> Just got back from work and installing Windows 11.
[2:41:49] <dds333a> @alladinbread Digimon got it from the same source. Dogu statues LUL
[2:42:17] <lonosis47> @ExpressNode woolie is still ignoring the fact that sora made it into smash
[2:42:21] <andre11dr> Well that was fast
[2:42:26] <alladinbread> True it was so out of place when it digivoled
[2:42:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lonosis47 it was acknowledged at the start
[2:42:36] <%ZweihanderSteve> ZweihanderSteve subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! happy to see you back! gratz on the wedding!

[3:18:57] <Enn19> Sukuna-hikona was said to be so small at birth,he fell through his mother's fingers
[3:18:58] <dds333a> Sukuna-hikona was also in SMT II as one of the Kunitsu sealed in a labyrinth
[3:18:59] <andre11dr> That's like how actual Mudo works
[3:19:05] <Enn19> Makes sense he's so small here
[3:19:21] <%BeautifulDuwang4> not in this game sadly,In DDS it actually does damage along with Hamw
[3:19:57] <Qu1ckyyy> @Enn19 That's why Naoto's persona is so tiny then
[3:19:59] <%BeautifulDuwang4> isn't Sukuna Hikona a boss in SMT4A and Naoto's initial persona?
[3:19:59] <dds333a> @beautifulduwang4 although the caveat is that in Digital Devil Saga, expel deals a percentage of damage
[3:20:07] <Enn19> @Qu1ckyyy Yeah
[3:20:14] <ExpressNode> I summon the busted bently
[3:20:22] <dds333a> 1/3 to 3/4
[3:20:33] <Enn19> @Qu1ckyyy His sprite in SMT4A is TINY
[3:20:46] <%BeautifulDuwang4> @dds333a i remember that. though i rarely used Hama in DDS
[3:20:59] <dds333a> In Digital Devil Saga, Death is just death  but Curse also has unique effects
[3:21:52] <dds333a> That's the dizzy symbol
[3:21:59] <andre11dr> Isn't like that in Nocturne too?
[3:22:09] <ExpressNode> I thought curse in that game made you more susceptible to death spells?
[3:22:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:22:24] <%BeautifulDuwang4> kinda though there are Light spells that do damage
[3:22:48] <dds333a> yes, it does, but in Digital Devil Saga Curse makes you take damage equal yo that you inflict
[3:22:51] <Qu1ckyyy> Died should be better then
[3:23:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> whew
[3:23:45] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:24:20] <dds333a> Sukuna-Hikona aint playin
[3:25:08] <dds333a> @beautifulduwang4 on a side note, Xanadu in Saga is expel, and just does raw damage, as you describe
[3:26:00] <Wingsofdarkness2> kane should be a demon
[3:26:17] <dds333a> double dip LUL
[3:27:06] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:27:36] <%ZweihanderSteve> use all items! fuck 'em up!
[3:27:44] <andre11dr> The more i look at him, the more it looks he has facehuger in his face
[3:28:37] <Wingsofdarkness2> im glad that these games dont spell demons  heretical like "daemons"
[3:28:45] <dds333a> he only hit Raidou, yeah
[3:29:15] <Wingsofdarkness2> i fucking hate that shit
[3:29:46] <dds333a> Sukuna-hikona always did it anyway, it's actually an opportunity to get damage in
[3:29:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:30:23] <+Ryukashin94> im confused, for how difficult this is, is woolie underleveled or is he playing on a harder difficulty?
[3:31:01] <Wingsofdarkness2> it seems pretty final bossy
[3:31:10] <dds333a> got got
[3:31:12] <Wingsofdarkness2> but idk
[3:31:23] <+Ryukashin94> is he at the end? i havent been following this LP very closely
[3:31:32] <dds333a> here it comes
[3:31:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> he's getting close iirc
[3:31:46] <andre11dr> Well where about to find out
[3:31:59] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[3:32:58] <Wingsofdarkness2> is he even taking damage?
[3:33:04] <brunoberserk> wow , this boss is a damage sponge or woolie is just underleveled ?
[3:33:04] <ExpressNode> Is he under leveled or is the boss just that hard?
[3:33:06] <dds333a> yes
[3:33:19] <Wingsofdarkness2> his bar aint movin
[3:33:25] <mememixtape> he is very weak to ice but woolie's ice demons bit the bullet
[3:33:33] <+Ryukashin94> like 10 dmg per hit and woolie at like is it lvl 50 something
[3:33:40] <dds333a> Sukuna-hikona is intentionally no joke, guys
[3:33:40] <Qu1ckyyy> He is strong against Phys right
[3:34:40] <Wingsofdarkness2> stingers seem effective
[3:34:42] <dds333a> it also should be specified Woolz isn't playing *completely* optimally, but it's fine, it's first playthough
[3:34:51] <+fetrigon> oof
[3:35:25] <+Ryukashin94> even if hes not playin optimally, is he at least following the rules of the game, like is he aware of things having weaknesses to different elements or whatever it has
[3:36:08] <dds333a> @ryukashin94 yes, but Munakata also has more than one weakness, and of course, he can't exploit anymore
[3:36:42] <+Ryukashin94> ah ok fair, so this literally has just boiled down to a battle of attrition at this point
[3:36:49] <Wingsofdarkness2> almost so close Kreygasm

[3:52:52] <Aeroallways> wasn't space alien from the moon actually one of the smt games?
[3:52:58] <dds333a> He used to be cool, if an idealist, but years before the game started, he just fucking died, and Sukuna-hikona said "it's free real estate"

[3:53:42] <+NopeBadguy> it doesn't HAVE to be a sad story
[3:54:00] <andre11dr> But why make your villain the most unbeatable guy ,but then some dumb alien just comes down and kills him in one second?
[3:54:02] <dds333a> which one? LUL
[3:54:31] <Aeroallways> ah yeah that's right. p3, been like a decade since I last played that.

[3:56:52] <andre11dr> I was scared that part 6 was going to do that but it didn't go down that way
[3:56:52] <drunken_lemur> @Daxalog What does that mean!?

[3:58:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:58:35] <%kyh9> Nintendo thinks the Internet is a fad
[3:58:38] <dds333a> @jinking79 not at all LUL
[3:59:05] <%kyh9> LOCAL ONLY GAMING IS GONNA COME BACK SOON, WE SEAR
[3:59:28] <ExpressNode> The only thing I need from Nintendo right now is the new dock with the lan port
[3:59:45] <dds333a> exactly LUL
[4:00:23] <@Menitta> damn sad I couldnt catch this stream
[4:00:41] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[4:00:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> don't be nice, they deserve it
[4:00:49] <%kyh9> Nintendo's business side is IMMENSELY incompetent
[4:01:10] <dds333a> it was literally there, but guess what
[4:01:14] <@Menitta> Nintendo is fucking lucky they're games are really good
[4:01:15] <ExpressNode> Until 4 years later
[4:01:18] <+fetrigon> it doesn't work for my sony headphones unfortunately üòë
[4:01:28] <dds333a> yep
[4:02:05] <andre11dr> Nintendo pretty much get to exist in success because they own the best IPs
[4:02:09] <+NopeBadguy> I wonder if they worked out a deal with SanDisk to build more SD cards
[4:02:11] <+NopeBadguy> So they removed that feature
[4:02:19] <+NopeBadguy> To sell more SD cards i mean
[4:02:41] <dds333a> it works, doesn't it Kappa
[4:02:47] <%kyh9> Smash is just done for me
[4:02:54] <ExpressNode> I bought a 400gb sd card for cheap but I don't think I'm gonna fill that thing up
[4:03:04] <brunoberserk> nintendo : '' i dont like when things are different ''
[4:03:07] <%MacMog> the Internet _outside Japan_ doesn‚Äôt matter
[4:03:18] <dds333a> and eats up battery LUL
[4:03:25] <+NopeBadguy> A large part of it is also just mindset stagnation. Nintendo doesn't care because they're Nintendo and people will sacrifice their firstborns to them regardless.
[4:03:28] <dds333a> and FUCK that Wii headset
[4:03:37] <%ZweihanderSteve> now to wait for Nintendo to release a version with all dlc characters woolieFUN
[4:03:47] <andre11dr> "what do you mean, we played it in Japan it works great"
[4:03:56] <%MacMog> within Japan, you have pretty low latency just due to the size of the country
[4:04:34] <Qu1ckyyy> So SMTV maybe?
[4:04:34] <andre11dr> It's honestly really dumb, the game sell the most in tje west
[4:04:36] <PanicSwytch> Im currently half way thru Nocturne. Would like to see u do more smt
[4:04:40] <%ZweihanderSteve> there def a core audience that craves it, but the core of that core is niche D:
[4:04:49] <Sapphire_Breeze> a lot might show up for SMTV
[4:04:59] <BlackermanZX> well disco was kinda a special lp
[4:05:02] <dds333a> I know I like it, I love that you're playing it
[4:05:11] <@Menitta> RPGs are hard to gauge long term interest
[4:05:17] <Aeroallways> I know for sure I'd show up for smt v
