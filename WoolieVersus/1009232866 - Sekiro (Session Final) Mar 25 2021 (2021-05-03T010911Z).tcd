[0:01:31] <leith_aziz> @DashXero : He doesnt accept the fact that we have opinions and keeps stating his opinions as fact. I've given up on him, but I just want him to leave us alone
[0:01:34] <andre11dr> Oh ok LUL
[0:01:35] <+megaman_sentinel> wtf
[0:01:36] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I hope he doesn't finish today. It would make me feel bad about myself

[0:01:40] <Deasmeister> Good job
[0:01:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:01:46] <jorniev> ITS VIDEO GAME
[0:01:47] <samazam94> oh shut up woolie lol
[0:01:52] <pennykettle_> I expected something wholesome, but I got pure bragging LUL
[0:02:08] <@Solidus_113> Savage raiding*
[0:02:13] <leith_aziz> Damn
[0:02:20] <andre11dr> I thought he was announce that his a father or some shit bye the way he was setting it up LUL
[0:02:22] <%JustYudha> what
[0:02:32] <Prevot> anti-woolie design
[0:02:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Fill your role or die?
[0:02:44] <+Terrah48> yeah it's absurd how much work goes into that
[0:02:46] <asakura_ayase> 8 weeks is still pretty good for savage.
[0:02:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Prevot LUL
[0:02:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Minh, what were you clearing?
[0:02:53] <%ChoculaUltra> think of it like labbing against a matchup
[0:02:56] <%JustYudha> Three hours a day?!
[0:02:57] <+Hollow_Mirage> Raiding needs you to put in work
[0:02:58] <samazam94> how to not get woolie into your game
[0:02:59] <deceitfulgemini> oh dear god is this ff14 talk
[0:03:04] <@Solidus_113> @AlteisenReiseZ E12S
[0:03:07] <JetpackMcQuack> I like the team aspect, not the rest of it haha
[0:03:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @AlteisenReiseZ Ahhhh.
[0:03:24] <samazam94> the prep and planning
[0:03:25] <ullyzeez> woolie is surrounded by mmo nerds
[0:03:26] <andre11dr> FF14 IS,YOUR NEW JOB
[0:03:35] <pennykettle_> That would be intense
[0:03:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie cam is flickering for anyine?
[0:03:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's some guilty gear shit
[0:03:47] <Flare3500> it flickered once just now
[0:03:48] <+shootbang_exe> lab for eight weeks until your brain expands
[0:03:49] <@Solidus_113> FF14 8 man raids are like dances, you have to know all the mechanics and where to stand
[0:03:52] <ullyzeez> bruh an 8 week fight wtf LUL
[0:03:56] <%dreadedcthulhu> @ballerswagbro9k it's been like that since the cam switch iirc
[0:04:02] <+Hollow_Mirage> 8 weeks for a new boss that was just added and there is no guide
[0:04:08] <quamdunk> That would be madness
[0:04:10] <JetpackMcQuack> What if your final fantasy party were 80 characters and had real lives
[0:04:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Some duties give titles
[0:04:16] <+the22cstomp> you get an achievement
[0:04:20] <NeonBleu> the armor is the icon
[0:04:24] <leith_aziz> @DashXero : I should mention that he played Giovanna in the beta, so maybe thats why he thinks so. Regardless, that doesnt mean its ok to try to shame those that like the game and believe it has depth. But let's move on and leave this convo behind
[0:04:30] <andre11dr> Imagine a 8 week bossfight ,holy shit LUL
[0:04:40] <pennykettle_> Life dropped an epic husband, the rarest of its loot table, and I was lucky enough to win the need roll
[0:04:44] <$Rumbutt> That's a weird horse
[0:05:03] <jraff89> The End
[0:05:07] <leith_aziz> "5 minutes is all it'll take"
[0:05:13] <+FallenAngelSC2> Already happened with FF11
[0:05:15] <dmysta3000> No that’s the XI boss
[0:05:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Sounds rad
[0:05:20] <%ChoculaUltra> it did tho lol
[0:05:23] <pennykettle_> MMO are only getting more casual I can't see that ever happening IMo
[0:05:26] <%Chichen> we do it
[0:05:29] <+megaman_sentinel> XI
[0:05:32] <+Aeoneth> @WoolieVersus Dragons Dogma has a boss that can take upwards of weeks to fight
[0:05:34] <%chrisarithmetic> ff11
[0:05:38] <@Solidus_113> There is 48 person raids
[0:05:42] <%Rixstarian> Pandemonium Warden got changed. He despawns after 2 hours if your alliance can't DPS enough
[0:05:42] <%LordSDB> Yeah I heard that happened in FF11 and they had to nerf it down because of how long and hard it was.
[0:05:43] <Haklex> That's just a eve online structure battle
[0:05:45] <leith_aziz> timed fights ?
[0:05:47] <%Chichen> thats DR Savage
[0:05:47] <%dreadedcthulhu> huge cyclical tag-in raid???
[0:05:49] <theyblamedthebeasts> the battle of the somme, coming to an MMO near you
[0:05:52] <dmysta3000> Absolute Virtue in FFXI
[0:06:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Rotating out players on a giga-boss
[0:06:07] <andre11dr> FUCKIN OW
[0:06:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @theyblamedthebeasts PTSD INCLUDED
[0:06:23] <%Rixstarian> @dmysta3000 AV does too much damage to chip down. You have to beat him or not
[0:06:23] <JetpackMcQuack> Some real cthulu shit
[0:06:26] <andre11dr> Did the sound glitch happen to anyone else?
[0:06:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Everquest
[0:06:32] <+AgentApe0> Nah
[0:06:39] <+krispen_wa> we talking about ffxiv now?
[0:06:46] <pennykettle_> can people stop being so cancer in chat
[0:06:47] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> no, it was pong
[0:06:53] <+AgentApe0> Wow basically lifted most of Everquest lol
[0:06:58] <+Aeoneth> Dragon's Dogma's Ur-Dragon is a shared boss that has health points in the Trillions, but it accumulates damage from every player that faces off against the dragon. Once someone kills the dragon there's a 45 minute window for people to "kill" the dragon for beter drops
[0:07:02] <JetpackMcQuack> The MMO promise versus the MMO reality
[0:07:05] <pennykettle_> FeelsBadMan
[0:07:08] <andre11dr> Ok then there must be some wierd shit going one with my headphones
[0:07:08] <Reckless_Rob> Maybe dont say the C word in chat?

[0:08:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ANOTHER ONE FALLS
[0:08:45] <@Menitta> I see
[0:08:47] <+AgentApe0> Raids were in basically form the start eith 40 players
[0:08:49] <+DazedCookies> bodied
[0:08:52] <Reckless_Rob> How long before Sekiro?
[0:08:53] <%akuda_bar> naruhodo
[0:08:53] <ken_dynamek> Into the woolie hole you go
[0:09:01] <+krispen_wa> DR
[0:09:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Other way around, started with biggest groups and went small to appeal to more casual crowd
[0:09:04] <%ChoculaUltra> look up Kerafyrm the Sleeper from Everquest - its a really dope look at the birth of stupid mmo bosses with wacky time/soul crushing mechanics
[0:09:12] <+OneTrueAsshat> wow started at 40 and cut down over time for raids
[0:09:13] <@Solidus_113> 24 person Alliance raids were the usual, the 48 is new
[0:09:13] <+krispen_wa> Well, BA came before DR
[0:09:17] <ullyzeez> @reckless_rob minh has to explain MMOs first so about 2 hours
[0:09:20] <leith_aziz> Is 14 still getting updates ?
[0:09:28] <+krispen_wa> 14 will never die
[0:09:30] <Reckless_Rob> @ullyzeez Hahaha LUL
[0:09:31] <%ChoculaUltra> 200 players came together to take on Kerafyrm, making it probably still the biggest mmo boss almost ever
[0:09:41] <+krispen_wa> and the new expansion is coming soon
[0:09:43] <+AgentApe0> WoW actually started at 40 then cut down to like 20 over the expansions
[0:09:44] <andre11dr> I love how Woolie goes out of his way to put you on blast, most streams just ban you LUL
[0:09:48] <%Rixstarian> @leith_aziz Never stops. New expansion soon
[0:09:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That is a thing!
[0:09:59] <%akuda_bar> one day woolie will learn about guild v guild and realm v realm cuz it's basically this
[0:09:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Castrum Meridianum
[0:10:02] <+FlubbedPig> You guys hear the Melty Blood news?
[0:10:03] <leith_aziz> 14 seems to be such a big game. Shame im not an MMO player
[0:10:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Go fucking nuts
[0:10:07] <+krispen_wa> Also did you know that FFXIV'S FREE TRIAL INCLUDES TWO FULL GAMES
[0:10:10] <+Epic_Fubar> -
[0:10:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Ff8 too
[0:10:17] <+shootbang_exe> alliance raids do that
[0:10:18] <@Solidus_113> FF14 has that now, it's a big group of people that take on 2/3 different sections
[0:10:21] <Flare3500> I want to get into 14 but Square doesn't like my country to register for some reason
[0:10:37] <%Rixstarian> @woolieversus Minh, that's Bizarro-Sephiroth, not Jenova-Synthesis
[0:10:39] <%akuda_bar> i used to do realm v realm, we used to have to call in australians to hold the fort overnight cuz the battle is 24/7
[0:10:46] <+krispen_wa> Is there a new Melty Blood to coincide with Tsukihime Remake?
[0:10:48] <Reckless_Rob> @Flare3500 Hate that shist
[0:11:01] <@Solidus_113> That technically happened LUL
[0:11:04] <Reckless_Rob> So a DBZF boss?
[0:11:07] <%ChoculaUltra> yes they actually just announced a new Melty Blood lol
[0:11:08] <vVAstrAVv> xenoblade x
[0:11:08] <leith_aziz> Apparently, a new Melty Blood is coming out
[0:11:10] <+Aeoneth> @WoolieVersus Dragon's Dogma does that but not on an MMO level
[0:11:13] <%dreadedcthulhu> the end state is log horizon
[0:11:17] <+krispen_wa> WAIT I WAS JOKIN5
[0:11:19] <@Solidus_113> Rebuilding Ishgard Housing was that
[0:11:21] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus WoW did that with some WorldState events back in the day
[0:11:22] <+krispen_wa> NEW MELTY BLOOD
[0:11:23] <%ChoculaUltra> the bathrooms are gonna be hype once more LUL
[0:11:24] <leith_aziz> I saw a pic an hour before
[0:11:27] <pennykettle_> That concept is amazing but the more moving parts (people) you have to beat a boss, it gets exponentially harder to complete
[0:11:29] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, Melty Blood Lumina iirc
[0:11:31] <andre11dr> pls no
[0:11:31] <JetpackMcQuack> My perfect mmo will be an action game
[0:11:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the closest thing i can think of is warframe with razorbacks and fomorians, thought i think that was never actually a real health bar
[0:11:40] <+Aeoneth> Instead the Ur-Draogn Boss has trillions of health and each instance of the fight in the world contibutes to shaving down the health
[0:11:47] <andre11dr> Not every server IS GOOD AT THE G
[0:11:47] <leith_aziz> Well, Melty Blood fans, congrats!
[0:11:50] <jraff89> IdentityEntity
[0:11:54] <%Rixstarian> @leith_aziz You can sort or play FFXIV as a single player game. Sometimes you have to queue for instances, but solo story can be consumed at your own pace
[0:11:56] <Blank9> one of the phantasy star onlines has a boss that pulls people into 1v1s
[0:12:00] <+Freakin_Wolfy> there needs to be a soulsborne MMO with bosses that are just never beaten
[0:12:05] <Reckless_Rob> 6 years of your life
[0:12:15] <@Solidus_113> you assume the average player will be able to complete that content LUL
[0:12:15] <ullyzeez> koreans are so weird their doujins are so long
[0:12:21] <jraff89> Maybe this is Elden Ring
[0:12:36] <NotHereToStream> manhwa format are weird
[0:12:38] <+krispen_wa> HOLY SHIT MELTY BLOOD REMAKE
[0:12:41] <Flare3500> Alright time to boot up FF14 stream
[0:12:44] <leith_aziz> Something we wanna bring up ?

[0:15:45] <+cubbywolf> cross
[0:15:50] <+shootbang_exe> what did caddicarus do?
[0:15:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> go Ashina Cross for Vergil hype
[0:15:58] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ashina Cross would open up additional options for upgrades
[0:16:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> GO GO POWER RANGERS
[0:16:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> morphin time?
[0:16:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Zordon calling, Minh?
[0:16:13] <Flare3500> Frankly speaking these skill require you to have confidence in your abilities to use them
[0:16:14] <%dreadedcthulhu> Disney with the dmca
[0:16:14] <%akuda_bar> @shootbang_exe tried to build a pc badly instead of using Artesian Builds Kappa
[0:16:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Whats the sitch?
[0:16:18] <pennykettle_> I wish you could press a button to turn that artwork into a demo video of the move
[0:16:23] <foxenco> @shootbang_exe tried to build a PC, check the latest video
[0:16:23] <+shootbang_exe> oof
[0:16:28] <ullyzeez> @ballerswagbro9k LUL
[0:16:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Get high monk. LUL
[0:16:30] <Reckless_Rob> Stinger fo sho
[0:16:39] <%JaseAdrift> lmao my mind went kim possible and power rangers
[0:16:54] <pennykettle_> IIRC there are more skill trees if you find certain items
[0:16:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> :(
[0:16:56] <+cubbywolf> you wont have fun pausing and switching mid combat
[0:17:00] <Reckless_Rob> @JaseAdrift Yes LUL
[0:17:02] <%hax_metatron> LIVING FORCE IS GREAT
[0:17:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> living force is GOOD
[0:17:06] <pennykettle_> Oh living force is dope
[0:17:13] <%hax_metatron> It's free damage bugg
[0:17:15] <%hax_metatron> *buff
[0:17:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Living Force RULES
[0:17:20] <Sonny_Firestorm> Living Force is the ultimate Headless cuck.
[0:17:23] <RaiNiMayonnaise> shadowrush for sure
[0:17:26] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Shadowrush is a great way to sneak in attacks
[0:17:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Damage go up GivePLZ
[0:17:38] <RaiNiMayonnaise> yeyeye
[0:17:39] <+cubbywolf> it wont it has a big hurt box
[0:17:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> also a good move
[0:17:42] <ullyzeez> ashina cross is cooler tho
[0:17:44] <%hax_metatron> "Be as an Owl on the hunt"
[0:17:45] <Flare3500> Get the Cool shit , you're not gonna use shadowrush
[0:17:48] <%hax_metatron> It's Owl's move @WoolieVersus
[0:17:52] <%hax_metatron> Read the descriptionm
[0:18:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Now that you got an Ultimate Art, talk to Emma.
[0:18:05] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeyeyeye
[0:18:10] <Johannen> Well, RIP better mortal draw..but i guess Woolie wouldnt unlock it anyway
[0:18:32] <ullyzeez> lmao he did research what a nerd
[0:18:44] <+cubbywolf> the headless?
[0:18:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> make sure you talk to Emma @woolieversus
[0:18:51] <pennykettle_> Does it have a followup or is it just that?
[0:19:03] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Talk to Emma when you have the chance
[0:19:05] <JetpackMcQuack> Stabs rule
[0:19:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> Emma
[0:19:08] <+cubbywolf> it IS about dmg
[0:19:21] <moeartifact> talk to emma
[0:19:22] <Louie_Salmon> Well damage and safety, kinda
[0:19:38] <+cubbywolf> the fire guy? oh i would have liked to see that
[0:19:40] <%Subjectivesloth> @pennykettle_ it has a followup jump that costs emblems, but it's main usage is for gap-closing
[0:19:47] <andre11dr> Wait, which fire guy?
[0:19:54] <pennykettle_> @Subjectivesloth man I wish they ditched the emblem system
[0:19:56] <Sonny_Firestorm> You were supposed to get it from the Tengu, but he's dead.
[0:19:58] <Johannen> @cubbywolf That was last stream or the stream before
[0:20:09] <+cubbywolf> oh k
[0:20:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yee
[0:20:44] <+cubbywolf> powaaaa
[0:20:49] <+robosqueeb> such a lust for power...wh- oh isshin
[0:20:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Esoteric Kappa
[0:20:59] <linSP> Heretic texts
[0:21:02] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[0:21:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> SHE SAID THE THING
[0:21:06] <brunoberserk> so isshin is basically edge master ?
[0:21:10] <%Subjectivesloth> The combined powers are so cool but they take so many levels to get -,-
[0:21:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FeelsBadMan
[0:21:39] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:21:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It takes hours of grinding
[0:21:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:21:59] <pennykettle_> I don't know if I ever got any of these
[0:22:03] <ullyzeez> you can grind dude
[0:22:07] <+cubbywolf> each skill costs more than the last one you buy
[0:22:15] <Flare3500> These are for the super boss rush
[0:22:21] <pennykettle_> You basically have to know this exists so you can not waste your point on stuff before, and rush it
[0:22:21] <linSP> no but the amount of grind needed is NOT fair though even for ng+
[0:22:21] <Reckless_Rob> Youll be grinding for weeks
[0:22:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's not that much grind, but it's also way cooler than it is useful
[0:22:24] <@Solidus_113> Exp scales so hard in Sekiro
[0:22:31] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You need 2 final skills for the most skills, its a combination
[0:22:46] <JetpackMcQuack> So much stuff ill never see
[0:23:05] <+cubbywolf> all the cool shit
[0:23:11] <%hax_metatron> We'll never see Tomoe chat
[0:23:11] <linSP> yeah you’d need to know ahead of time to not waste XP on other shit by the time you get this text if yo actually wanna USE them
[0:23:14] <+robosqueeb> its so good
[0:23:16] <%Subjectivesloth> @WoolieVersus Spiral cloud passage is Genichiro's flurry attack
[0:23:22] <%Subjectivesloth> like move for move
[0:23:50] <pennykettle_> I wish you could actually use the mortal blade like an alternate weapon
[0:23:52] <brunoberserk> black getsuga tensho
[0:23:53] <+cubbywolf> so good
[0:23:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> Charged Mortal Draw
[0:24:03] <Johannen> Better Mortal Draw
[0:24:06] <Deasmeister> Same cost too
[0:24:21] <+cubbywolf> its better better md
[0:24:25] <+robosqueeb> longer mortal draw
[0:24:35] <ullyzeez> no mortal already has a double attack
[0:24:42] <+cubbywolf> it has stun onnalot of boss
[0:24:50] <DarkestDawn64> Mortal draw already has a follow-up
[0:24:51] <+FlubbedPig> Calling it a "super boss" is kind of a misnomer. It's Manus hard, not DS2 Ancient Dragon hard. It's 100% doable.
[0:24:58] <brunoberserk> is cool but ... is useful ?
[0:25:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Using the sacrificial dagger gives you like double uses
[0:25:55] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus It's the red fat guy in Outskirts, the blue Swordsman in Ashina Castle, and the Spearman in Ashina Castle.
[0:26:13] <%dreadedcthulhu> upgrade tree
[0:26:18] <+JD0394> @woolieversus there is one optional boss you shouldn’t skip
[0:26:21] <%Lion_kun> What is this cowardice Woolz
[0:26:29] <pennykettle_> I don't like the trees in this game, I don't like needing everything before it, I just want 1 path
[0:26:30] <%hax_metatron> The thing about the Lazulite flame vent is, with the followup skill, you get free Divine Confetti effect
[0:26:35] <+FlubbedPig> It's really not a super boss.
[0:27:10] <RaiNiMayonnaise> its not ridiculously hard.. just different
[0:27:14] <ullyzeez> who is woolie gonna be fighting chat?
[0:27:22] <JetpackMcQuack> I really enjoyed this part, no more bullshit
[0:27:22] <Johannen> Crazy TALK strieks again
[0:27:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ullyzeez DoH i think
[0:27:24] <%chrisarithmetic> DOH
[0:27:33] <+JD0394> The boss isn’t bad at all when you realise you shouldn’t fight it like other bosses in this game
[0:27:40] <%KillianST> the grind is waaay to long to see the endgame skills
[0:27:45] <Flare3500> The Fire Nation has attacked
[0:27:47] <+FlubbedPig> Continue along the Outskirts path, it ends in the boss
[0:27:50] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Just continue backwards thru outskirts
[0:27:54] <+robosqueeb> gotta go backwards
[0:27:59] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:28:11] <Deasmeister> Yeah just back from there
[0:28:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean it's still pretty hard because he can basically two shot you. Or at least he could me
[0:28:12] <ullyzeez> kk thanks chat
[0:28:14] <+AdlerDynamic> yeah, just do what you were doing, keep walking back
[0:28:32] <RaiNiMayonnaise> yeah backwards is the path
[0:28:38] <+robosqueeb> its kind of annoying but from a gameworld perspective I think blocking the path was pretty coo
[0:28:50] <+Undenizen> what'd i miss gang?
[0:28:53] <%DrJamesWoods> Where they at in the game?
[0:29:06] <+AdlerDynamic> the endgame, only one required boss left
[0:29:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[0:29:08] <RaiNiMayonnaise> you can even just ignore all the enemies in the path
[0:29:13] <+robosqueeb> right at the ass end of the game, just a few big boys left to fight
[0:29:14] <+cubbywolf> last 5%
[0:29:15] <+b_aleph> yeyeye demon of hatred let's go
[0:29:16] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:29:18] <+Undenizen> @DrJamesWoods this is just after the dragon boss

[0:30:55] <theyseemerowling> items?
[0:30:57] <Flare3500> I was replaying Sekiro and BLoodborne at the same time , even that was a bad idea
[0:31:01] <brunoberserk> fuck the red hat gang, all my homies hate the red hat gang
[0:31:24] <pennykettle_> I don't get why they make you go backwards here just to warp you forward
[0:31:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[0:31:39] <Coystick> The hooooowling
[0:31:45] <Sonny_Firestorm> monkaS
[0:31:46] <+Mr_Pylon> First spear guy?
[0:31:48] <Johannen> Crazy Talk
[0:31:52] <%Dapper_Cactuar> horse dude right?
[0:31:59] <pennykettle_> This is the first miniboss and usually first time people revive
[0:32:16] <Coystick> Do the Sekiro wiggle
[0:32:20] <%JaseAdrift> woolie just mashing that parry
[0:32:29] <moeartifact> still hasn't mastered the makiri counter lol
[0:32:33] <+cubbywolf> bow
[0:32:33] <pennykettle_> YEAAH
[0:32:48] <%DrJamesWoods> Is this the final boss?
[0:33:00] <Coystick> Don't fuck with the interior ministry
[0:33:03] <JetpackMcQuack> TWO SWORDS
[0:33:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Shuriken is for stingers
[0:33:12] <+AdlerDynamic> this is the superboss
[0:33:20] <Johannen> Its a shuriken not a gun
[0:33:22] <Flare3500> You have to charge it up I think
[0:33:27] <+FlubbedPig> Lazulite Shuriken does more than a basic sword slash, actually. They're just blocking it.
[0:33:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> HERE WE GO
[0:33:37] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:33:39] <%hax_metatron> HIT THAT IDOL

[0:34:35] <dds333a> A bit of a Balrog going on there
[0:34:35] <+cubbywolf> thats an ashura imo
[0:34:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You CAN block those steps
[0:34:38] <sperium3000> This is a sick ass fight. Hard as balls, but really fun.
[0:34:38] <Coystick> That fuckin' Kabuki Theatre pose
[0:34:39] <%DrJamesWoods> wuh happun?
[0:34:40] <Johannen> Hit that sack
[0:34:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> Insight Increased by 1.
[0:34:52] <+vaderxyz1970> Sculpted does not like paying Taxes
[0:34:55] <%hax_metatron> Jump and Block
[0:35:02] <%hax_metatron> Or rather block while jumping in this one
[0:35:05] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> this boss took me 5hrs and even when I beat him I got lucky
[0:35:09] <jraff89> Gonna have to watch out for that health bar OLED burn in for this one
[0:35:10] <ullyzeez> now the nioh hours should oay off
[0:35:11] <deceitfulgemini> wait I was gone for a minute, how the hell did we make it all the way here
[0:35:15] <+cubbywolf> this boss hard af
[0:35:16] <%druupy_> I love the cheese on this fight
[0:35:18] <Coystick> Sculpture has returned to monke
[0:35:19] <JetpackMcQuack> Needed more buddha I guess
[0:35:19] <hassanico2> Red Umbrella is really good here
[0:35:22] <Blinge_Sadface> This boss... kinda sucks. wouldn't blame anyone for tilting here
[0:35:23] <SovPho> Parry the boss tho
[0:35:38] <andre11dr> Even the music gets Bloodborne ish
[0:35:39] <SilverChariotAxel> has anyone yelled at woolie about metly blood?
[0:35:42] <kazataca> Rubbish, Lawrence aint got nothin on this bloke
[0:35:44] <Blank9> he's got the fur and everything
[0:35:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It seems impossible but you CAN block
[0:35:50] <+AdlerDynamic> this boss is very divisive, some people love it
[0:35:52] <+livi242> I actually really like this fight
[0:35:53] <R3c0n31> It really really similar
[0:35:53] <%hax_metatron> Flame Umbrella is great for this one too
[0:35:53] <shinichizio> yo that's not cool automod leave the joestar secret tech alone
[0:35:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> Oh no
[0:35:56] <Coystick> You can see the Bloodletting Beast's model rig underneath him
[0:35:58] <zocano> I found the umbrella helped me a ton here, I enjoy this fight
[0:36:00] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus FromSoft: "fight this bloodborne boss is sekiro idiot"
[0:36:02] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:36:03] <SovPho> This game is so weird where every boss is parry-able which goes against every Souls game lol
[0:36:05] <Blinge_Sadface> Is Parry a thing in this fight? surely you just run out of emblems?
[0:36:07] <otakon17> oh hey that only did 90% of your health in damage
[0:36:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:36:11] <Johannen> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Woolie stil figuring out deflect button)
[0:36:19] <SovPho> Yeah you can parry him
[0:36:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Stay close: the fight
[0:36:24] <dds333a> @silverchariotaxel in what way? as in to play it, or something else?
[0:36:26] <SovPho> just like you can parry the stupid bull
[0:36:29] <JetpackMcQuack> This boss takes 110%
[0:36:35] <%hax_metatron> Please stop calling it parrying chat. In Sekiro you block and deflect. Thinking it's parrying is a mistake
[0:36:35] <+LTKonnor> Is this woolie's first encounter with this boss?
[0:36:40] <+LTKonnor> I just got here
[0:36:40] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:36:44] <+LTKonnor> Aight
[0:36:47] <otakon17> Defend
[0:36:48] <SilverChariotAxel> @dds333a new melty blood announced
[0:36:52] <Blinge_Sadface> alright. Deflects with red shield... don't you just run out of embrems?
[0:36:55] <andre11dr> He really is Lawrence and Bloodletting combined
[0:36:56] <+cubbywolf> T
[0:36:58] <RaiNiMayonnaise> thats a swep
[0:37:00] <+cubbywolf> F
[0:37:02] <%DrJamesWoods> Attack those bals
[0:37:05] <+AdlerDynamic> very cool fight though
[0:37:09] <secretly_a_raccoon> Jump on the balls
[0:37:12] <@Solidus_113> remember your umbrella
[0:37:16] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Mission: Survive
[0:37:21] <Flare3500> Rihanna saved me in this fight
[0:37:21] <Deasmeister> Big bloodborne boss
[0:37:27] <%hax_metatron> God I can't wait for final boss
[0:37:31] <Blinge_Sadface> i just run around like Nascar for this one then tickle his leg
[0:37:32] <otakon17> Does Woolie got the good Umbrella Shield?
[0:37:35] <JetpackMcQuack> That’s about right
[0:37:40] <ullyzeez> use a bolt paper idiot
[0:37:46] <+OntarioJake> Mission: Stay On That Ass
[0:37:51] <Blank9> doing kabuki poses
[0:37:54] <otakon17> I feel like it would be useful against the fireballs and overhead slams
[0:38:03] <+JD0394> He’s doing really well for a first attempt
[0:38:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> Kabiku popses KEKW
[0:38:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Block steppy!

[0:38:15] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Mashed jab
[0:38:22] <+FlubbedPig> You can block and deflect his physical hits
[0:38:22] <hassanico2> Why is it doing Kabuki?
[0:38:31] <Blinge_Sadface> is mortal blade good for this one?
[0:38:32] <sperium3000> Man Woolie is doing waaaaay better against him than I did my first try
[0:38:37] <sperium3000> Welp, he still did better
[0:38:38] <theyseemerowling> Because Kabuki is rad
[0:38:39] <otakon17> that's the Nioh pose
[0:38:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not a bad first attempt
[0:38:40] <+AdlerDynamic> you can still use mortal draw even with no emblems btw
[0:38:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> @hassanico2 It's the scuptor.
[0:38:44] <otakon17> it's not Kabuki
[0:38:46] <$TheFabledAble> @hassanico2 it was originally a person
[0:38:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Only boss that crashed my PC
[0:38:55] <+JD0394> Don’t forget to use your pellets if you run out of gourd
[0:38:58] <RaiNiMayonnaise> saving emblems for fire umbrela and whistle is what I used
[0:39:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> use Malcom
[0:39:05] <hassanico2> Yeah I just don't get what Sculptor has to do with those poses
[0:39:06] <SilverChariotAxel> @WoolieVersus Have you seen New Metly
[0:39:14] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ashina Cross is a technique Ishin used to cut off Shura's arm
[0:39:19] <+JD0394> @woolieversus malcontent
[0:39:21] <+cubbywolf> the easy phase
[0:39:28] <ullyzeez> you can charge the shuriken @woolieversus
[0:39:30] <andre11dr> Woolie use the power of Rihanna
[0:39:32] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Yep
[0:39:35] <otakon17> @hassanico2 they're guardian dieties in Japanese mythology IIRC
[0:39:36] <Peyote_> Fire umbrella is god tier this fight
[0:39:38] <+b_aleph> tanto it up
[0:39:38] <hassanico2> oh yeaaaah the whistle
[0:39:42] <+robosqueeb> hmmm will it :^o
[0:39:44] <RaiNiMayonnaise> malcontent works 3 times
[0:39:45] <%Lion_kun> Save it.
[0:39:45] <hassanico2> Like Gascoigne
[0:39:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ay the music box
[0:39:46] <$TheFabledAble> OH NICE
[0:39:50] <@Solidus_113> like Gascoigne's music box
[0:39:52] <kazataca> Umbrella wil save many lives in this fight
[0:39:56] <sperium3000> @hassanico2 People are getting the other way around. Those poses are not meant to represent kabuki, those poses are in kabuki to represent demons.
[0:39:57] <$TheFabledAble> thats some gascoigne shit!!!!
[0:40:03] <otakon17> Umbrella is the most underrated tool int his game
[0:40:08] <linSP> Gaskwang
[0:40:10] <hassanico2> @sperium3000 thank you
[0:40:13] <andre11dr> wow ,even more Bloodborne rip offs LUL
[0:40:23] <%druupy_> Pretty gamer move to figure that out himself
[0:40:24] <+cubbywolf> taste the fire
[0:40:32] <andre11dr> Well i guess you can't tip off your own game
[0:40:32] <%ChoculaUltra> oh he hates it
[0:40:39] <andre11dr> Homaged
[0:40:40] <Coystick> Settle in, this'll be a long & hard one
[0:40:42] <quamdunk> Go for his gross demon gooch
[0:40:44] <+JD0394> Not really a rip off if you created both
[0:40:50] <Blinge_Sadface> ^
[0:40:52] <hassanico2> and it stopped working :(
[0:40:55] <otakon17> I wonder if aiming for the head would do more damage since he's crouched over so much
[0:40:56] <deceitfulgemini> wonder how many uses that has
[0:41:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> Only works twice I'm afraid.
[0:41:07] <+FlubbedPig> I found Nightjar Slash can be a good Combat Art for this. Lets you get in and stay in.
[0:41:09] <%druupy_> I’d be surprised if weren’t here most of the stream
[0:41:10] <otakon17> @hassanico2 it has a cool down like the firecrackers to prevent spamming
[0:41:19] <sperium3000> Just to be sure Woolie, this IS a bonus fight. Optional.
[0:41:24] <+cubbywolf> i never tried the finger cool
[0:41:35] <otakon17> @sperium3000 that means it's REQUIRED
[0:41:38] <+OntarioJake> the whistle is a last resort
[0:41:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> twice
[0:41:41] <%DrJamesWoods> It worked twice
[0:41:42] <ullyzeez> you can still block his attacks woolz
[0:41:49] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus It worked 2 times, and you double used it on the second
[0:41:51] <deceitfulgemini> @sperium3000 woolie has been hunting the cool bosses, regardless of optional though
[0:41:55] <$TheFabledAble> its like gascoigne, it only works so often
[0:41:55] <Blinge_Sadface> " I aint fighting you on a wall " - take notes, DSP! LUL
[0:41:58] <perritoborracho420> Slap da booty
[0:42:05] <Parapattern> Bosses are only optional if you're a coward
[0:42:08] <RaiNiMayonnaise> thats odd I remember it working 3 times
[0:42:08] <+cubbywolf> you missed the promot
[0:42:09] <Peyote_> Malcontent works three times you just need to time it properly
[0:42:10] <srv4254> doesnt it work 3 times the third is shorter
[0:42:13] <otakon17> that was a rush not a grab
[0:42:13] <+cubbywolf> prompt
[0:42:18] <+robosqueeb> also works on big monke right?
[0:42:23] <JetpackMcQuack> That’s the move
[0:42:25] <otakon17> yo should have bought them gold bags!
[0:42:26] <+JD0394> @woolieversus it works twice so don’t abuse it. Use it to get you out of tight spots
[0:42:29] <%Lion_kun> It works 3x
[0:42:33] <Reckless_Rob> Just get your souls ba-oh wait
[0:42:34] <andre11dr> GOTTA GET THE CASH
[0:42:36] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:42:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> wtf I never used that it's free
[0:42:42] <Blinge_Sadface> Sculptor BibleThump
[0:42:53] <ullyzeez> buy spirit emblems now man
[0:42:53] <hassanico2> Chat would you recommend he use Confetti here?
[0:43:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hassanico2 nah
[0:43:04] <Blinge_Sadface> only if the ghosts are dead
[0:43:05] <Aydarkzero> not really
[0:43:06] <Coystick> Unnnf I love dat pose
[0:43:08] <StarlessAH> Honestly this boss is awful, I'd just say use the tower cheese
[0:43:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:43:12] <Nanomachiner> no use wasting the confetti
[0:43:16] <+couragebatou> I'd recommend the shield tbh
[0:43:19] <SovPho> Yeah you should probably go for the head as much as possible
[0:43:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Dont forget about your tanto
[0:43:21] <+cubbywolf> the whiff LUL
[0:43:21] <Reckless_Rob> So I suppopse you wanna save them for the last fase
[0:43:22] <%illtima> Oh fuck it's the second best boss in the game
[0:43:25] <Blinge_Sadface> it's possible to ace this fight. so it cant be all bad
[0:43:26] <+couragebatou> The shield trivializes this fight
[0:43:30] <RaiNiMayonnaise> confetti is good extra damage if you can afford it
[0:43:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he HATES it
[0:43:30] <otakon17> @Nanomachiner if all the headless are dead, might as well. It boosts atk power a ton
[0:43:33] <%Subjectivesloth> @WoolieVersus the flame-protection umbrella is almost required for this fight
[0:43:39] <%Subjectivesloth> also divine confetti helps
[0:43:45] <deceitfulgemini> oh wow, foot stooled
[0:43:45] <Blinge_Sadface> @Subjectivesloth nah, did it by just sprint-dodging
[0:43:47] <Nanomachiner> No use using the confetti here yet, still
[0:43:47] <+OntarioJake> I saved whistle and confetti for the last phase
[0:43:54] <otakon17> Okay I think the lock-on is screwing with Woolies ability to dodge the stomps
[0:43:55] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus you can parry his stomps to get extra posture dmg on em
[0:44:00] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, i forgot about this bosses wierd furry dick
[0:44:04] <Blinge_Sadface> just sprinting vs this guy can be remarkably consistent
[0:44:04] <SovPho> you can also "deflect" his big swings pretty easy
[0:44:06] <Nanomachiner> Not till woolie's getting to phase 3 raw and just needs a lil extra chunk
[0:44:06] <+cubbywolf> bonk
[0:44:09] <hassanico2> It's just too bad you do so little damage
[0:44:13] <+JD0394> @woolieversus save them for last phase
[0:44:17] <Spearweaver> I did this without umbrella, perfectly doable
[0:44:18] <MadamePixieStix> Hai woolie! GET EMMMM
[0:44:22] <Peyote_> The best way to dodge the stomps is to dodge back diagonally
[0:44:23] <SovPho> so running around a lot and deflecting his big jumps works
[0:44:28] <Johannen> I wish the description of Divine confetti just stated it increased damage to normal enemies also
[0:44:37] <Reckless_Rob> Yeah he can parry stomps
[0:44:37] <+Freakin_Wolfy> don't parry the giant fire monster
[0:44:39] <Coystick> When the ginger finally fuckin' snaps
[0:44:39] <otakon17> I mean unless it's RED you can block it
[0:44:41] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:44:42] <+cubbywolf> yeah if you treat this like a souls boss you can run around and slash him
[0:44:43] <ullyzeez> dont forget about the L1 button my man
[0:44:43] <+robosqueeb> thinkin bout dem beans
[0:44:44] <Blinge_Sadface> I was too much of a puss to try and deflect him tho.
[0:44:44] <pennykettle_> It feels so much like a boss from a different game, you forget to use this games mechanics
[0:44:45] <moeartifact> omg someone finally said it
[0:44:47] <Aydarkzero> same
[0:44:51] <Blinge_Sadface> @Coystick it's about time.
[0:45:02] <Afrosamasenpai> aww yeah the best boss
[0:45:03] <Zayasu> parry this Kappa
[0:45:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> These boss fights are incredible
[0:45:09] <ullyzeez> LUL
[0:45:11] <hassanico2> Can you only swing towards him if he jumps?
[0:45:13] <otakon17> good jump!
[0:45:14] <JetpackMcQuack> Whole new fight LUL
[0:45:15] <Afrosamasenpai> He'll dance his way into your heart
[0:45:19] <+cubbywolf> owie
[0:45:26] <%Subjectivesloth> The key to a lot of Sekiro's bosses is to remember they're not bloodborne bosses and can be parried/blocked lol
[0:45:34] <SovPho> yeah def don't parry the fire
[0:45:36] <@Solidus_113> use the umbrella when you see that fire hand swing

[0:45:55] <Peyote_> I like using the umbrella when he jumps up and comes down
[0:46:09] <otakon17> and deadsurprised you haven't been using the RedGourd this time
[0:46:17] <Peyote_> You can tank the slam and then do the follow up
[0:46:26] <Blinge_Sadface> you can sprint right under the fireball toss if you're mid-range.... IIRC? and get a punishe
[0:46:27] <pennykettle_> What is the significance of all the characters missing their left arm
[0:46:29] <otakon17> he wants your tender giblets!
[0:46:34] <andre11dr> ALMOST
[0:46:38] <otakon17> pennykettle_ SYMBOLISM!

[0:48:03] <+cubbywolf> LUL staggering it
[0:48:03] <otakon17> it's the lock on

[0:49:04] <pennykettle_> were those idol shapes in the fireballs?
[0:49:07] <otakon17> so save it for the last phase
[0:49:14] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ministry Dousing powder is better than gourd for fire prevention and extinguishing
[0:49:14] <+cubbywolf> F
[0:49:16] <samuelfisk> Yes pennykettle
[0:49:19] <+JD0394> @woolievs you should get the last needs first. The health boost isn’t insignificant
[0:49:19] <ullyzeez> "that foot will getcha" -Woolie Madden

[0:49:46] <+krispen_wa> the demon of ANGERY
[0:49:59] <%Subjectivesloth> huh does he always say "Sculptor" ah the fight's start? I don't remember that
[0:50:03] <pennykettle_> Wait did they add that "Sculptor..." line? They hint repeatedly, its so obvious already"
[0:50:08] <otakon17> that's right stay at the crouch
[0:50:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:50:25] <MadamePixieStix> mjdurlLove mjdurlLove mjdurlLove
[0:50:28] <The_Nerd_Supreme> C. Viper and Demon of Hatred are the same character. Both use fire, have unpredictable/untelegraphed attacks & movement and last neither of them belong in the game the original first appeared in Kappa
[0:50:30] <+cubbywolf> id you have enough conversations i think he says sculptor
[0:50:35] <theyseemerowling> *fire-angutan
[0:50:37] <moeartifact> @Subjectivesloth there's quest stuff you need to do to get that prompt
[0:50:59] <otakon17> OOOH dat was good
[0:51:04] <+cubbywolf> yooo a block
[0:51:08] <+cubbywolf> sweet

[0:51:38] <+cubbywolf> woolieYE woolieTRASH woolieYE woolieTRASH
[0:51:44] <$TheFabledAble> @krispen_wa theres like 4 mini bosses prior to this fight so he couldve stocked up
[0:51:46] <otakon17> fiyah monke
[0:51:49] <+cubbywolf> one or the other
[0:52:03] <theyseemerowling> The fact that his Shura form matches his Shinobi makes me wish the Shura ending had Okami turn into a wolf made of ash or some shit
[0:52:07] <+D4C_Trice> does woolie have the umbrella?
[0:52:07] <Spearweaver> fire monke hit like trukk
[0:52:15] <glass_marcus> this is the darksouls boss right?
[0:52:17] <theyseemerowling> *Shinobi moniker
[0:52:19] <+krispen_wa> USE A CALL BEYOND
[0:52:32] <CoffeeSlice> get the fire umbrella ella ella
[0:52:34] <pennykettle_> smash that monkey ass
[0:52:35] <ullyzeez> does this mean woolz hasnt seen the last genichiro fight?
[0:52:36] <+FlubbedPig> I believe you can run and slide underneath the fireballs if you're timing's good.
[0:52:43] <EX_shuffle> I love this fight
[0:52:50] <%MrKerb> How many bosses left?
[0:52:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YO GOOD PARRY
[0:52:56] <andre11dr> So why dose Sculptor turn into this thing again? He just gets so bored that he loses his shit LUL
[0:53:00] <RaiNiMayonnaise> this and final boss
[0:53:07] <velgaduere> oh hey I'm here in time for Bloodborne
[0:53:11] <theyseemerowling> the ministry attacks
[0:53:11] <+krispen_wa> BMA EVELYN HIS HEAD
[0:53:19] <theyseemerowling> and he's like nah fuck this
[0:53:20] <+vaderxyz1970> He hates
[0:53:22] <+krispen_wa> USE THE PIZZA CUTTER
[0:53:22] <+vaderxyz1970> ta
[0:53:27] <Spearweaver> he was consumed by Shura
[0:53:27] <+D4C_Trice> got to love how everything you've learned in a game gets thrown out the window when the boss is like fighting it in a different game
[0:53:29] <+vaderxyz1970> taxes
[0:53:40] <samuelfisk> He went to fight the ministry and his hate went wild.
[0:53:43] <+cubbywolf> fucking taxes
[0:53:50] <Wild_Samurai> is this his first playthrough?
[0:53:52] <andre11dr> Oh yeah he was fighting some dudes when you show up
[0:53:52] <Spearweaver> struggling to hold back the hatred is like sculptors entire thing
[0:53:57] <pennykettle_> wow thats lame
[0:54:04] <andre11dr> Still seems like mega overkill
[0:54:10] <Spearweaver> and he fails at it in the end obv
[0:54:12] <+FlubbedPig> @andre11dr He's always sorta been this. That's why all the Buddhas he carves are furious. The Interior Ministry bringing war to the region just set him and.
[0:54:15] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:54:19] <velgaduere> "wait I gotta have dialogue before I get hurt again"

[0:54:26] <+krispen_wa> JESUS
[0:54:29] <%hax_metatron> Remember Woolie, there is no stamina in this game
[0:54:31] <%hax_metatron> Keep running
[0:54:35] <Ashenik1> how long have tehy been plaing?
[0:54:35] <ullyzeez> you need to charge the shuriken for it to be worth man
[0:54:48] <+cubbywolf> not long today
[0:54:55] <+krispen_wa> Would this boss be easier in a regular Souls game?
[0:54:58] <Ashenik1> fuck this boss
[0:55:02] <pennykettle_> yes
[0:55:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> nice iframes
[0:55:06] <+krispen_wa> Wolf doesn't seemed equipped for this
[0:55:20] <owazowski> Imagine legit fighting this boss
[0:55:21] <+cubbywolf> yeah the boss wouldnt be so agile in a reg souls
[0:55:27] <Ashenik1> katana for big thick skinned monster aint the best weapon
[0:55:32] <Peyote_> If you had the bloodborne dodge yeah
[0:55:32] <+FlubbedPig> Ichimonji doesn't really have a place in this fight. Might want to switch to something else.
[0:55:40] <andre11dr> That pointed hair on his crotch is really distracting
[0:55:45] <Johannen> Wolf is totaly equiped, Woolie might not be thou as seeing he still learning to deflect
[0:55:50] <pennykettle_> If all else fails we can do these instakill cheese strat
[0:55:54] <snakemuho> DoH has like 5-10% too much hp
[0:55:55] <Coystick> Can you do the Mortal Blade art in mid air?
[0:56:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I'm glad Woolie didn't skip this boss
[0:56:03] <marumiyan1> came just in time for a bossfight :D
[0:56:12] <fritz_dacat> swipe slash its all in the mind, gotta swing your sword if you dont want to burn your hide
[0:56:12] <+krispen_wa> would a Hunter be able to defeat Sekiro or would the ninja samurai murder a Hoonter easily?
[0:56:15] <Coystick> f l a m e a p e
[0:56:16] <+cubbywolf> DED
[0:56:20] <Johannen> @marumiyan1 Its all bossfights for this point on
[0:56:21] <+FlubbedPig> You can't run out of the fire, you NEED to jump.
[0:56:24] <pennykettle_> oh no
[0:56:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair enough
[0:56:27] <Spearweaver> Hoonter wins
[0:56:28] <+shugonokitsune> awww
[0:56:32] <%X2Eliah> The backdown is real
[0:56:35] <+cubbywolf> we running away Bois
[0:56:37] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa depends on the hunter and samurai Kappa
[0:56:39] <+OneTrueAsshat> this fight is much easier than final boss
[0:56:42] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[0:56:48] <ullyzeez> C O W A R D
[0:56:49] <RaiNiMayonnaise> cowardice at its finest
[0:56:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I'm glad Woolie didn't skip this boss...
[0:56:53] <+cubbywolf> woolieOMG
[0:56:55] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[0:57:11] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Well we don't know how OP blood infusion is outside of fighting beasts
[0:57:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[0:57:19] <%hax_metatron> Honestly I'd rather him go against Isshin
[0:57:27] <%hax_metatron> He can do this boss on his own time
[0:57:27] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Its doable
[0:57:31] <Ashenik1> this boss is bulshit and there is an easy way to cheese it Kappa
[0:57:32] <ullyzeez> @woolieversus the shuriken can be charged
[0:57:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Phase 3 is more of 2 iirc
[0:57:35] <andre11dr> Also Hunters are semi beasts
[0:57:36] <+cubbywolf> his hp is less in phase 3 iirc
[0:57:37] <RaiNiMayonnaise> 3rd phase isnt too different
[0:57:44] <Johannen> @hax_metatron Same, i would rather see him go up against Shura ending and Final Boss
[0:57:46] <%hax_metatron> Final boss is sick
[0:57:53] <+krispen_wa> @andre11dr it would be wild if cthulhu great ones are weaker than an average Genichiro
[0:57:56] <%X2Eliah> Yeeah don't get stuck here
[0:57:57] <+AdlerDynamic> if you want to beat the game today you should probably go to final boss, because that will not be a quick fight
[0:57:59] <An_Armed_Bear> You can use flame umbrella for the big ground fire move
[0:58:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can do it, you're already getting through phase 1 pretty alright
[0:58:03] <RaiNiMayonnaise> fair enough
[0:58:03] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus No intention of going back and doing the Shura Ending boss?
[0:58:05] <%hax_metatron> Woolie deserves the final boss for all Sekiro has put him through
[0:58:06] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> You're gonna want to spend time with the final boss for sure.
[0:58:08] <snakemuho> oh sure the final boss won't require another session Kappa
[0:58:08] <%druupy_> Beat the game today LUL
[0:58:11] <bear_breaker20> bet ALL my channel points beating the game aint happuning
[0:58:14] <An_Armed_Bear> I could never consistently dodge it so I used that
[0:58:21] <Johannen> @hax_metatron Woolie put himself thru that lol
[0:58:21] <+cubbywolf> it took me 1 and a half play sessions to beat
[0:58:21] <%X2Eliah> This looks like a DS3 boss put on fire
[0:58:22] <+AdlerDynamic> yeah I want to see a prediction for that
[0:58:24] <Coystick> Laughs in SS
[0:58:33] <Zayasu> Kappa 10 hour stream incoming
[0:58:35] <+krispen_wa> Are there any iframes in Sekiro?
[0:58:45] <andre11dr> I think so
[0:58:52] <Ashenik1> Thats just a fucking Laurence on stereoids
[0:58:53] <BonzoBeanMachine> yes
[0:58:57] <VJdarkworld> some people have trouble with demon of hatred, others final boss. me? both were hard for me DxCat
[0:59:05] <+ListlessToboggan> iframes are very very short
[0:59:05] <brunoberserk> exist some particular reason to why woolie wants to finish the game today ?
[0:59:05] <Indigo_Automaton> @krispen_wa yes but narrower than souls
[0:59:07] <kazataca> It took me 2 weeks just to beat DOH
[0:59:10] <%druupy_> “Beat the game today” he said woolieKICKDAD
[0:59:14] <sporeian94> lol
[0:59:35] <Coystick> Woolie "Beating the game today" Madden
[0:59:41] <+krispen_wa> this is just demon prince + 1st phase ludwig
[0:59:44] <%X2Eliah> LUL those tiny demon legs
[0:59:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> NICE
[0:59:47] <%BinaryFireball> man I just cheesed this dude so hard
[0:59:48] <+AdlerDynamic> beating the game today LUL
[0:59:48] <sporeian94> Woolie, this is a pure endurance fight, there's like 0 tricks other than that whistle. Just gotta clench your ass and take it like a man
[0:59:49] <+FlubbedPig> @brunoberserk He assumed he'd already have finished Sekiro like 2 streams ago. He had no idea he had this much left.
[0:59:51] <CoffeeSlice> noice
[0:59:54] <%BinaryFireball> this fight was ass
[1:00:08] <andre11dr> Oh now that i look at the date, i see why Woolie needs to beat the game today
[1:00:21] <SQDizzy> Honestly, I just did the cheese method
[1:00:23] <MihajloMBlood> Yeah, the Dota anime comes out today
[1:00:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @andre11dr yea lol
[1:00:34] <%X2Eliah> dota anime?
[1:00:39] <%X2Eliah> wuh?
[1:00:44] <ullyzeez> minh might have to break curfew today
[1:00:47] <MihajloMBlood> Yeah, Dragon's Blood. It's out today
[1:00:50] <Spearweaver> dota got an anime
[1:00:51] <ullyzeez> or sleepover
[1:00:54] <sporeian94> Up and Left when he charges
[1:01:05] <+FackinCrazy> Just got here but the flame umbrella can block entire combos from him
[1:01:06] <+krispen_wa> Is it because Woolie is gonna watch Heaven's Feel 3 next week?
[1:01:12] <Spearweaver> apparently its high production quality, but generic
[1:01:14] <%X2Eliah> Gonna be real I didn't know dota was still a thing. Didn't it die out around the time fortnite started?
[1:01:18] <odd_slater> Did Woolie see Melty?
[1:01:31] <%baka_sugoi> MELTY BB
[1:01:33] <Spearweaver> still going strong
[1:01:38] <sporeian94> Did they ever patch out the cheese?
[1:01:39] <%X2Eliah> yeeeeee

[1:02:46] <Draco_Renegade> Who else here cheesed this boss?
[1:02:47] <+Hollow_Mirage> I can’t believe this Finale is just 1000 Degree Cleric Beast
[1:02:50] <+krispen_wa> ITS THE DEMON PRINCE
[1:02:52] <Flare3500> Target their colostomy bag

[1:03:18] <Onamar> "Parries are for cowards" the boss
[1:03:22] <+Bluecille> like tha literal jiggling ass of asylum demon you MUST SLAP for efficient killing
[1:03:22] <%X2Eliah> Actually "Ball Souls" is so appropriate as a name xD
[1:03:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The dash is very forgiving on jump
[1:03:27] <andre11dr> IT WON'T LIT
[1:03:28] <%hax_metatron> He can if he uses the whistle in the third form
[1:03:28] <VJdarkworld> demon of hatred is def the most 'souls' boss in here
[1:03:38] <Flare3500> Oh shit Phase 3 we do it
[1:03:42] <Coystick> His big ball even has a jiggle to validate Woolie's ballgression

[1:06:34] <+BloodyBurney> serious mode
[1:06:36] <Flare3500> Arms are indeed sweaty
[1:06:41] <+robosqueeb> he's most dangerous in the mid range area, swings and fire, best to honestly just cup his balls
[1:06:42] <Zayasu> wtf i fought him without the whistle, it makes it much easier?
[1:06:46] <Coystick> Woolie you're doing really well, faster prog than I got first time
[1:06:46] <%dreadedcthulhu> can u interrupt the spin with the whistle?
[1:06:46] <+couragebatou> The umbrella soaks most of the fire damage jsyk. You can just stay in on him and beat them balls
[1:06:49] <VJdarkworld> GREAT BALLS OF FIRE vs ATTACK THE BALLS
[1:06:55] <+Undenizen> Do you like having a lot of space? Well, that's a shame.
[1:06:55] <plaguedoctor_syan> Hey Woolie do you like Sumo?
[1:07:00] <+FlubbedPig> Maybe switch out Ichimonji
[1:07:01] <+krispen_wa> MANSCAPED: THE BOSS
[1:07:02] <ullyzeez> H I C
[1:07:07] <Jessalpha12> Has Woolie heard about the new Melty Blood with rollback?

[1:10:07] <+Dova573> this boss is a fucking nut
[1:10:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> spinning around him like a blue hedgehog seems to be wokring
[1:10:35] <%X2Eliah> Meanwhile one guy just djenting out on a flute in the background
[1:10:45] <Coystick> OOOOH
[1:10:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ooooof
[1:10:46] <+Dova573> MEATY
[1:10:46] <+Grayhammatter> OOF
[1:10:49] <Blank9> otg
[1:10:51] <jaygee303> “Run away” the fight
[1:10:54] <+krispen_wa> ON THE THE WAKEUP
[1:10:56] <andre11dr> 2nd phase Lawrence is really cool, but also jank hitboxes
[1:10:57] <+SouLucha> Also Lawrence isn't doing dope Kabuki poses while he's styling on ya!
[1:11:00] <RaiNiMayonnaise> he may or may not uppercut
[1:11:02] <deceitfulgemini> alright, i'm gonna go get some free donuts, hopefully phase 3 when I return
[1:11:04] <+FrostedZaibatsu> This boss made me rage.. its super rare that happens on a single player game
[1:11:14] <Coystick> The fucking poses make this fight
[1:11:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:11:21] <%X2Eliah> @deceitfulgemini thoughts and prayers
[1:11:32] <mibbsy> This game is so cool, this guys a fucking Monster of a boss tho
[1:11:37] <Coystick> Manus never danced for us, what a jerk
[1:11:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Demon is annoying because you have to fight up completely differently than what makes the combat so fun and good
[1:11:44] <andre11dr> At least this is better fire boss than anything DS1 has to offer LUL
[1:11:44] <kazataca> I literally sold my Sekiro copy after this boss
[1:11:47] <+penjaza> Gets hits in on the transition to second phase
[1:12:02] <%X2Eliah> Sekiro is the most boss-focused of the soulsbourne games, right?
[1:12:13] <brunoberserk> and SHAVE HIS DEMON'S BALLS
[1:12:14] <+Dova573> I remember just holding the sprint button the whole time during this fight
[1:12:24] <whirly25> demon of angy bois
[1:12:27] <Indigo_Automaton> @X2Eliah Not focused but they are the high point of the game
[1:12:30] <Josef_Stryker> Ah I see Woolie is fighting the boss that forces you to now play the game
[1:12:34] <Josef_Stryker> *not
[1:12:35] <PanicSwytch> I cheesed this boss after dying 100 times
[1:12:42] <scrumbotime> This is the guy that dollar shave club was training you to fight
[1:13:00] <+Grayhammatter> ah, trying to give him the ol' dick twist
[1:13:14] <Josef_Stryker> This boss is cool but it basically makes you have to play it like a Souls game
[1:13:16] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Don't think I remember this guy. Is this DLC or did I just miss something?
[1:13:20] <Josef_Stryker> So it really fucks you up
[1:13:27] <Josef_Stryker> He's a bonus boss
[1:13:32] <+krispen_wa> hes a secret boss
[1:13:35] <linSP> introduce him to the shaved ball club
[1:13:37] <%X2Eliah> See if Woolies' katana had 5 blades instead of just 1, like a proper shaving utensil, then he would be *done* by now
[1:13:44] <StarlessAH> if it were a souls game the answer would be havel's armour and stand still
[1:13:48] <+FrostedZaibatsu> No a secret boss, just optional
[1:13:52] <Coystick> Use the forbidden technique, MORTAL SHAVE!
[1:13:56] <Josef_Stryker> Does Woolie have the Fire Umbrella?
[1:13:59] <andre11dr> His like the Gundyr of this game
[1:14:03] <kazataca> Just mach3 it
[1:14:09] <andre11dr> Or Nameless
[1:14:12] <+Dova573> this may be a souls boss, but don't forget the advantages you have in this game that you dont in souls
[1:14:30] <PanicSwytch> Did they ever fix the cliff glitch on this boss?
[1:14:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @panicswytch nope!
[1:14:50] <Speckster42> cliff glitch is in patched
[1:14:51] <+Grayhammatter> nice nice nice
[1:14:54] <%X2Eliah> So this would be a good time to summon your Palico
[1:14:58] <+Dova573> Man champion gundyr is one of my favorite fights
[1:15:07] <andre11dr> Also Gundyr>Nameless
[1:15:16] <+penjaza> Okay, I was wrong
[1:15:19] <+krispen_wa> gundyr is my favorite brainded parry simulator
[1:15:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> never walk with this mofo lol
[1:15:25] <marumiyan1> those hit like trucks
[1:15:29] <Spearweaver> we learning
[1:15:30] <+balkonas1> This is more of a Bloodborne boss in sekiro
[1:15:33] <Coystick> Demon of Must Protect My Ball Hair
[1:15:34] <Indigo_Automaton> The Flame Umbrella can tank his dropping aerial attacks allowing you to get some hits in right after he lands
[1:15:35] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[1:15:37] <GlaceonYo> !hotdog
[1:15:39] <marumiyan1> damnit
[1:15:46] <gunsrlove> Bodied with complete disrespect

[1:15:47] <kazataca> You can parry gundyr?/
[1:15:52] <+Dova573> yeah
[1:15:53] <Josef_Stryker> Arguably harder than the final boss imo
[1:15:54] <andre11dr> You can
[1:15:54] <ullyzeez> run in all the time
[1:16:02] <+krispen_wa> he's the easiest parry in the game
[1:16:04] <andre11dr> If your a terrible person
[1:16:04] <%X2Eliah> So wayt how come that demon's ball hair isn't all singed up from the fires and heat?
[1:16:18] <+Dova573> Running in the 90s the fight
[1:16:30] <Indigo_Automaton> @X2Eliah The sweat's keeping it moist
[1:16:38] <%X2Eliah> ...
[1:16:39] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> He's too mad to get burned alive
[1:16:45] <%X2Eliah> I didnot want to imagine that
[1:16:48] <%X2Eliah> goddamn you xD
[1:16:48] <Toaster_Noodle> This fight was my wall in this game, took the most tries by far
[1:16:49] <kazataca> The black monter part? Or just the human part?
[1:16:50] <Indigo_Automaton> @X2Eliah Hey you asked
[1:17:11] <pineapplepervert> nice souls boss
[1:17:30] <%X2Eliah> Woolz is slipping
[1:17:42] <Coystick> There are no bad runs, only unshaved balls
[1:17:48] <+krispen_wa> he had such a good run before too
[1:18:10] <%X2Eliah> Bad run is a run where you waste rare consumable resources without getting it done
[1:18:14] <+FlubbedPig> When you're close like that, sliding lets you low-profile the fireballs
[1:18:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:17] <%X2Eliah> Anything else is peachy
[1:18:36] <Coystick> Is that stagger available every time you grapple that jump?
[1:18:43] <+yukichocomilk> this boss took me hours
[1:18:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I had so much confetti at this point I had no reason not to use it
[1:19:16] <andre11dr> Ok ,now that i hear it again Sekiro might be my least favorite soundtrack
[1:19:22] <Josef_Stryker> Wait does Sekiro know it's the sculptor? I never got this dialogue whenever I fought him.
[1:19:33] <%X2Eliah> @andre11dr It could benefit from a bit more variety
[1:19:48] <Spearweaver> you need to do quest stuff with sculptor for wolf to recognise him
[1:19:50] <+ChrisAlgoo> I believe that dialogue triggers if you gave the sculptor enough drinks
[1:19:57] <+krispen_wa> oof he chips through parries with the fire hand
[1:20:37] <Toaster_Noodle> Has he reached final phase at all yet?
[1:20:38] <Josef_Stryker> Does Woolie not have the umbrella?
[1:20:40] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:20:41] <Coystick> I love it
[1:20:43] <Indigo_Automaton> DENIED
[1:20:43] <An_Armed_Bear> DESTROYED
[1:20:44] <VJdarkworld> COMBO NotLikeThis
[1:20:44] <+krispen_wa> THE WAKEUP
[1:20:44] <%X2Eliah> @Toaster_Noodle ye
[1:20:45] <+SouLucha> @Josef_Stryker You have to eavesdrop and drink with him and get certain conversations where he asks you personally to take care of him if it comes to it.
[1:20:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL
[1:20:52] <Toaster_Noodle> Ah, okay
[1:20:53] <personmanthingg> welcome to the bloodborne boss
[1:20:53] <Coystick> He have a cook out
[1:20:54] <+ChrisAlgoo> got oki'd
[1:20:54] <kazataca> Sekiroman's just like ''ahh, big monster''
[1:20:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> he's reading you Woolie!
[1:20:58] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Divine Confetti does good damage since he's an "apparition-type"
[1:21:00] <andre11dr> TOASTY
[1:21:04] <pineapplepervert> Woolie, just go to the roof and cheese him LUL
[1:21:12] <Coystick> And confetti
[1:21:16] <%X2Eliah> cheesing is no fun
[1:21:21] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Maybe do Final Boss first then come back for this one with the remaining time if any?
[1:21:24] <+FrostedZaibatsu> this boss man. its okay to walk away from this one
[1:21:26] <+penjaza> Umbrella good for fireballs
[1:21:29] <%Lion_kun> Do it Woolz
[1:21:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I totally think you could do it, it's clear you just need a good run
[1:21:31] <andre11dr> Can you still cheese it?
[1:21:33] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You will enjoy the Shura and Final Boss more, we will also
[1:21:34] <Kyoshikei> Minh!! <3 FeelsAmazingMan
[1:21:39] <Spearweaver> this is fun as a viewer
[1:21:39] <%X2Eliah> @RaiNiMayonnaise great idea
[1:21:42] <Coystick> "Genichiro"
[1:21:45] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> I agree, save it for the final boss.
[1:21:46] <Indigo_Automaton> You could always come back after you finish the final boss
[1:21:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> agreed Johannen
[1:21:49] <Deasmeister> He can come back if he beats final boss super quick right
[1:21:49] <+SouLucha> You had a really good run.
[1:21:49] <andre11dr> They never fixed that shit huh LUL
[1:21:50] <+Undenizen> @andre11dr not really. one of the hardest fights in the game
[1:21:52] <ullyzeez> the final boss is gonna take a lot longer i think
[1:21:56] <+AdlerDynamic> maybe go do the final boss and then come back
[1:22:05] <An_Armed_Bear> "Just one more run"
[1:22:09] <pennykettle_> You can always come back to this boss even later as a bonus
[1:22:19] <andre11dr> Maybe like 30 more minutes
[1:22:22] <VJdarkworld> Just One More KomodoHype
[1:22:23] <Indigo_Automaton> BELIEVE! IN! YOURSELF!
[1:22:24] <%X2Eliah> well
[1:22:24] <+SouLucha> ONE MORE
[1:22:25] <marumiyan1> "yes"
[1:22:32] <+ChrisAlgoo> this fight has a lot in common with old man ashina imo
[1:22:33] <samazam94> yeah, id say that works
[1:22:38] <+cubbywolf> woolieVS
[1:22:38] <andre11dr> Since Genichiro is like right there
[1:22:40] <ullyzeez> the balls?
[1:22:41] <+krispen_wa> SUMMON A POUNDMATE
[1:22:44] <samuelfisk> Do you need to beat a boss to fight their memory?
[1:22:55] <Spearweaver> yes
[1:22:57] <Toaster_Noodle> The final bosses were far easier than Sculptor to me, personally
[1:22:58] <+AdlerDynamic> yup
[1:23:10] <andre11dr> Use a water type
[1:23:11] <Toaster_Noodle> He can always come back if he doesn't want to brute force it
[1:23:37] <+krispen_wa> Did he finish his Yakuza 7 streams yesterday or are there more?
[1:23:42] <WhiskeyTime> have they patched out the option to cheese this boss?
[1:23:48] <Ashenik1> you can jump inbetween bosses though
[1:23:54] <DaKnightWarrior> You got this.
[1:23:55] <samazam94> the final bosses can be done with posture kills, this one cant
[1:23:56] <An_Armed_Bear> I know a lot of people didn't like this fight but I was a fan, lets you push the "no stamina" thing to the limit
[1:24:03] <plaguedoctor_syan> he really is a sekijo (one arm oragutang) makes me wonder if Sekiro shura form is a big wolf like this
[1:24:10] <+Gubb_Wobbler> New Melty Blood coming out pog
[1:24:21] <DaKnightWarrior> @gubb_wobbler so hyped!
[1:24:29] <Coystick> His balls must be tender at this point
[1:24:32] <Toaster_Noodle> @Gubb_Wobbler It has rollback, right?
[1:24:34] <+SouLucha> I loved this fight, gave me trouble like any person but I also just didn't block or use the fan.
[1:24:38] <marumiyan1> NOOOO
[1:24:38] <Spearweaver> rollback netcode PogChamp
[1:24:39] <+Gubb_Wobbler> it has rollback

[1:27:06] <+SouLucha> I always though those things are the souls of people he's murdered.
[1:27:13] <samazam94> a reminder to not bug woolie to talk about melty blood. hes playing the game, and would like to avoid talking about things unrelated to the game

[1:34:22] <deviljhojho_> and you guys said it would take him hours
[1:34:24] <Sonny_Firestorm> Talk to the old lady.
[1:34:25] <StarlessAH> Isshin met Shura before, and CUT OFF ITS ARMS
[1:34:27] <%X2Eliah> @RWLJr98 in 2028?
[1:34:29] <lucky_icarus> He fucked up that Ape for killing his bo
[1:34:30] <%JaseAdrift> He was pissed
[1:34:31] <sperium3000> You get more lore on him by giving him booze.
[1:34:31] <brunoberserk> he was REALLY ANGRY
[1:34:33] <%Ariamis2187> he was carving those demons to hold the demon back
[1:34:35] <+penjaza> Emma was supposed to kill him
[1:34:39] <penitentpendant> @RWLJr98 Right after Half Life 2, of course
[1:34:40] <%Ariamis2187> *buddhas
[1:34:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> go in the building where you first met Isshin @woolieversus
[1:34:46] <RWLJr98> @x2eliah yeah.
[1:34:51] <+SouLucha> Pretty sure that's a Shura.
[1:34:58] <%SainEdge> yeah thats why sculptor was always making these budda statues. He said in the beginning of the game, that they help him stay calm
[1:35:04] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ishin cut off an arm of a Shura as mentioned in the Ashina Cross description
[1:35:06] <Deasmeister> I think Isshin cut off his arm to stop him
[1:35:08] <+SouLucha> He was stopped once from turning early.
[1:35:09] <ullyzeez> sculptor was the one who oicked her up
[1:35:13] <andre11dr> Wasn't Ishin the one that cuts of his arm?
[1:35:17] <pennykettle_> I think that merchant NPC is voiced by Mick Lauer who is doing that badass Jojo project
[1:35:23] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Sculptor took Emma in as a child. Sculptor started to turn into Shura, but was stopped when Isshin cut his arm off. Emma trained in the sword to kill Sculptor should he ever turn again.
[1:35:26] <+MugenSandan> the sculptor was muttering about Fire he knew he was close to being a demon
[1:35:29] <An_Armed_Bear> this whole side of the plot was cool to me
[1:35:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Isshin cut off his arm when he almost when Shuts before
[1:35:34] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus the tengu said that he cut off his arm and brought orangutan back from the brink of being shura. but seeing the flames of war ended up causing him to boil over
[1:35:35] <Indigo_Automaton> Flame vent is all you can get
[1:35:35] <%X2Eliah> So Sekiro universe is: everyone eventually turns into a demon?
[1:35:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Shura* lol
[1:35:37] <An_Armed_Bear> isshin, shura, the scultpor, etc
[1:35:39] <+Undenizen> This is why he was obsessed with sculpting the buddha. he was trying to zen his rage away
[1:35:57] <+krispen_wa> Wolf...I'm already a demon
[1:35:58] <marumiyan1> @X2Eliah nah man that's nioh
[1:36:01] <penitentpendant> Social Drinks GO
[1:36:06] <moeartifact> but all his buddhas, they mention, were all very angry too so lol
[1:36:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @x2eliah if you spend your life dedicated to killing, yeah
[1:36:13] <Nanomachiner> man i love buddhism
[1:36:21] <TheyCallMeVawn> All their links were S rank
[1:36:24] <andre11dr> WELL SHE DIDN'T DO SHIT
[1:36:31] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[1:36:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> need the fan before that
[1:36:39] <Spearweaver> notice how the hut sculptor lives in has all those demon warding charms on it
[1:36:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think
[1:36:46] <+ChrisAlgoo> none of these really affect the final boss iirc
[1:36:50] <sperium3000> @andre11dr It's not her fault he turned while the country was being invaded
[1:36:56] <+ChrisAlgoo> chat, did woolie get the two fruits and etc?
[1:37:01] <samuelfisk> Yes
[1:37:01] <An_Armed_Bear> yeah
[1:37:05] <+ChrisAlgoo> nice
[1:37:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> in a secret convo, Emma asks the Sculptor to go demon on the ministry lol @woolieversus
[1:37:10] <Johannen> Should have invested)
[1:37:10] <Lobster_Lord> aw, did i miss demon of hatred?
[1:37:12] <+FlubbedPig> Sacred Flame is actually good against Demon of Hatred specifically.
[1:37:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> my b i've become one guy
[1:37:23] <+Epic_Fubar> Chat, Did he beat DoH yet?
[1:37:28] <+Jiggisnipe> Yep
[1:37:30] <+Grayhammatter> he just beat it
[1:37:31] <An_Armed_Bear> just did
[1:37:31] <dds333a> ye
[1:37:31] <$TheFabledAble> just did
[1:37:32] <sperium3000> just did
[1:37:32] <%SainEdge> yes he did
[1:37:32] <%dreadedcthulhu> just did
[1:37:38] <+Epic_Fubar> Lets go
[1:37:45] <NumbF4ke> Yeah, I missed it too:
[1:37:46] <sperium3000> It is TIIIIIIIIME
[1:37:48] <%druupy_> No he didn’t Kappa
[1:37:52] <linSP> isn’t the reason the sculptor makes so many statues because they all turn out as Buddha’s of hatred?
[1:37:56] <RWLJr98> Where are we going
[1:38:07] <$TheFabledAble> he equiped his rinegan and learned that boss so fucking fast
[1:38:18] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus you can talk to an npc about the sculptor in the building where you first met tengu
[1:38:19] <ullyzeez> just do the final boss man he's gonna take a while
[1:38:25] <andre11dr> Man why can't you fight Buddha in this game
[1:38:31] <Lobster_Lord> Manus, Cleric Beast, and Demon of Hatred all feel similar. All have a crazy demon arm.
[1:38:38] <An_Armed_Bear> DoH seems overwhelming at first but he leaves tons of openings
[1:38:39] <%X2Eliah> Eeh woolie can two-shot the final boss
[1:38:42] <%X2Eliah> No big deal
[1:38:43] <Sonny_Firestorm> Blue Flame won't be very useful against the final boss.
[1:38:49] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Ashina Outskirts has some near a sniper tower that you ran by to get to Demon
[1:39:14] <+krispen_wa> Okay but what about Blue Flame buffed with Crystal Magic Weapon?
[1:39:23] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If you have the Demon Bell idol in the Senpou temple you can use that to increase the drop rate
[1:39:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:27] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus you can talk to an npc about the sculptor in the building where you first met tengu
[1:39:36] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, i guess Manus was the proto beast that they later brought back in BB
[1:39:40] <andre11dr> Hmmm
[1:39:50] <+FlubbedPig> There's an old lady in the building next to Demon's boss room that has new dialogue.
[1:39:52] <+ChrisAlgoo> people fall to Shura when they can't wait for elden ring anymore
[1:39:54] <+SouLucha> Oh yeah, the old lady has some dialog.
[1:40:11] <Lobster_Lord> cleric beast and manus also have similar head. all those horns
[1:40:16] <StarlessAH> Shura is the japanese word for the hindu/buddhist concept of Asura
[1:40:22] <pennykettle_> LUL
[1:40:25] <jaygee303> Did he beat demon of hatred?
[1:40:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:40:26] <%X2Eliah> One of Elden Ring bosses will be a gigantic overweight GRRM.
[1:40:28] <StarlessAH> Sekiro just beat up Asura's wrath
[1:40:37] <Flare3500> from morning to night
[1:40:37] <dds333a> not news
[1:40:37] <+Mrbaconator> not like it's gonna get up and walk
[1:40:40] <rosemon5001> no cleanup crews in this game
[1:40:51] <+krispen_wa> Shiva the Deceased = Proto-Genichiro
[1:40:54] <pennykettle_> "hmmm reminds me of the sculptor! I wonder why!" C team wrote this game
[1:41:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @starlessah imagine trying to party that mofos URURURURURURURU punches lol
[1:41:10] <andre11dr> If Elden Ring doesn't have poison swamps then you know it's a bad game
[1:41:19] <An_Armed_Bear> open world poison swamp nooo
[1:41:26] <%hax_metatron> This is Miyazaki speaking to all of us, after extremely violent series of games
[1:41:27] <+ChrisAlgoo> love to dash through green stuff
[1:41:32] <rosemon5001> first area im betting @andre11dr
[1:41:38] <%X2Eliah> He can't be grateful is he's dead
[1:41:45] <%hax_metatron> He talked about this in a talk with Fumito Ueda
[1:41:45] <PanicSwytch> Poison swamp or lava floor
[1:41:51] <Flare3500> Alright kill her she's outlived her usefulness
[1:41:57] <ullyzeez> kill her
[1:42:04] <Lobster_Lord> I like how this game has Buddhist/Hindu stuff while Nioh is mainly Shinto.
[1:42:08] <%X2Eliah> GRANNY SUS
[1:42:12] <%hax_metatron> Miyazaki said he feels guilty about making a name because of violent games, when he was inspired by the beauty of Ueda's games
[1:42:17] <rosemon5001> indeed sus
[1:42:18] <An_Armed_Bear> Granny Shura for sequel
[1:42:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can find one Lump of Wax under the half sunken building with the Carp Daughter, if you haven't picked that one up laready
[1:42:38] <snakesolidmyore> Did he legit beat DoH or did he cheese it
[1:42:44] <An_Armed_Bear> legit
[1:42:46] <$TheFabledAble> he beat em legit
[1:42:47] <+krispen_wa> he legit did it
[1:42:48] <%X2Eliah> @snakesolidmyore hard legit
[1:42:48] <An_Armed_Bear> didn't even use umbrella
[1:42:51] <+krispen_wa> by shaving his balls
[1:42:55] <+AdlerDynamic> very legit
[1:42:57] <$TheFabledAble> read that boss like a fuckin boss
[1:42:58] <Basic_Birch_> How many times did he try?
[1:43:00] <andre11dr> Man Snow levels don't get enough respect in Souls, they are always the the best zones(except for the DLC in DS2)
[1:43:02] <%X2Eliah> @snakesolidmyore massive leg git
[1:43:05] <+krispen_wa> about an hour
[1:43:05] <moeartifact> whacked his balls a bunch for the W
[1:43:06] <%BinaryFireball> little turd
[1:43:07] <+Freakin_Wolfy> has he fought the final boss yet? is he even there?
[1:43:12] <Lobster_Lord> @hax_metatron Miyazaki = Sculptor?
[1:43:13] <Spearweaver> not yet
[1:43:21] <%hax_metatron> @Lobster_Lord That's my theory
[1:43:21] <Coystick> Dragonrot, the most nothing mechanic
[1:43:26] <%hax_metatron> Especially after the Ueda talk
[1:43:28] <%X2Eliah> eeew "grave wax"
[1:43:34] <Lobster_Lord> really interesting
[1:43:41] <%aogman> SSzrw
[1:43:44] <+krispen_wa> @andre11dr the dlc was fine. horsefuck valley was the only bad part
[1:43:44] <ullyzeez> @freakin_wolfy for some reason he wants to grind first
[1:43:49] <Ashenik1> like eating eggs in Cowboy bebop was for sorrow
[1:43:52] <rosemon5001> @andre11dr only the gauntlet bullshit at the end wich was truly optional was complete trash
[1:43:55] <StarlessAH> dragon rot was originally going to massacre your entire game but they removed the real consequences last minute
[1:43:59] <+patel347> has woolie already seen the final boss?
[1:44:06] <Sonny_Firestorm> Not yet
[1:44:09] <JDebss> And what did it cost?
[1:44:11] <%Afterman_> fuck me.the mother from arrested development died
[1:44:13] <Indigo_Automaton> Yeah I'm not a fan of Sekiro's levelling system.
[1:44:18] <+AdlerDynamic> I can't wait to see woolie take on the final boss
[1:44:26] <sperium3000> It's not really a lvelling system
[1:44:27] <+Dustwalker44> If Dragon Rot did do that it would be dumb and ruin al lthe fun the game was building
[1:44:38] <sperium3000> This is not an rpg
[1:44:42] <pennykettle_> Currency and XP are separate in this game which goes against all the others
[1:44:51] <Spearweaver> can't grind and get huge either
[1:44:52] <%DrJamesWoods> We talkin about how this isn't a Dark Souls?
[1:44:53] <Flare3500> OG Demon Souls was suppose to delete your save in the early development
[1:44:56] <+ChrisAlgoo> and 3 you could grind your stats up, not so much here
[1:45:01] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Left from the first Sunken Valley idol, the path ends with a place to dive underwater. Should be a gravewax there too.
[1:45:04] <RWLJr98> I never played a souls-like, fun to watch though.
[1:45:12] <ullyzeez> @afterman_ fuck malory archer is dead??
[1:45:12] <+MugenSandan> Buddha is stingy, it's being realistic psaDab
[1:45:20] <Coystick> Action/Stealth with bad stealth & great action.
[1:45:20] <+krispen_wa> Demon Souls was supposed to kill you in real life if you died in the game
[1:45:27] <Indigo_Automaton> I understand losing currency, but the xp loss prevents you from seeing some of the cooler abilities unless you grind a LOT or play perfectly
[1:45:31] <%Afterman_> @ullyzeez yes. she was 80.
[1:45:35] <+FlubbedPig> There's a grave wax by a sniper tower in this area too
[1:45:41] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa and your family
[1:45:45] <JDebss> never farm
[1:45:55] <pennykettle_> I remember one time in school a kid told me the next zoo tycoon game would have a real life place where your zoo would be built IRL. STFU kid LUL

[1:46:52] <Flare3500> Just have some god damn faith we'll fight the god damn boss Arthur
[1:47:00] <dds333a> Which could not be further from the truth.
[1:47:01] <andre11dr> Fighting the final boss is THE ONLY REASON where even here LUL
[1:47:02] <RWLJr98> I didn’t say that :)
[1:47:02] <Nanomachiner> fuck it all bosses are cancelled now
[1:47:02] <Coystick> Start a new game & go fight the first boss again just to spite him.
[1:47:03] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Way further in near the teleport to Demon there's a sniper tower with an Ogre near it. There should also be one to the left of the first Sunken Valley idol, underwater.
[1:47:09] <Lobster_Lord> this game made dive deep into Buddhist and Hindu mythology. bloodborne got me into Lovecraft. blessed From Soft
[1:47:11] <+ChrisAlgoo> aw yea balloons
[1:47:12] <RaiNiMayonnaise> I wouldnt even be mad if he puts this on haitus again for lols

[1:47:23] <%X2Eliah> Ok, listen.
[1:47:24] <+MugenSandan> no Woolie, play how I want you to play, I want to relive my experience through you :^)
[1:47:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can just turn around at this idol and kill the first few people really hard, it's super good for farming
[1:47:26] <+krispen_wa> Woolie should start the game over just to spite woolieONEGUY
[1:47:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Oh yeah, shame you didn't do the Shura ending cause it gives the most Vergil move in this entire game.
[1:47:34] <%X2Eliah> Fromsoft space/sci-fi setting game?
[1:47:36] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Golden Vortex also gives items when used on enemies
[1:47:38] <Afroperonista> @DrJamesWoods unless it's a positive comment LUL
[1:47:44] <+Dova573> I want an Aztec/Mayan souls game

[1:48:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it's easy enough to get the drop on her though
[1:48:19] <andre11dr> @lobster_lord I guess, i still feel this doesn't go that hard into Buddhism, and there's nothing Hindu i think
[1:48:19] <dds333a> hell, I remember using it then
[1:48:20] <%Afterman_> @X2Eliah there is the surge. just not fromsoft
[1:48:21] <pennykettle_> StinkyCheese

[1:48:28] <ullyzeez> hell yeah so exciting
[1:48:34] <+krispen_wa> this aint farming concords in DS3, thats for sure
[1:48:39] <Lobster_Lord> i want any setting that From hasn't already done before. this is why Elden Ring disappoints me, but who knows how it will turn out
[1:48:40] <+FlubbedPig> Demon Bell is in Senpou Temple
[1:48:43] <+Rathalos2006> Did he do the Demon of Hatred yet?

[1:48:58] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:49:01] <%Afterman_> demon of hatred is only worth beating via making him kill himself
[1:49:02] <+Rathalos2006> Dang. I'll have to catch that on the VOD
[1:49:02] <+SouLucha> No, demon bell and idolless is hard mode.
[1:49:03] <%X2Eliah> How rare is rare?
[1:49:07] <An_Armed_Bear> has he done phase 2 yet?
[1:49:07] <%X2Eliah> Like 5% rare?
[1:49:09] <+Freakin_Wolfy> the lightning ladies are weak to poison if I remember correctly, makes her easy to kill
[1:49:11] <%X2Eliah> 0.05% rare?
[1:49:12] <%AmuserName> You can jump over the broken wall on the left as a path to reach more flute-players, from the viewpoint you see when looking at this fortress from the idol.
[1:49:15] <Lobster_Lord> @andre11dr there was enough there that intrigued me and made me look up stuff. got lost in wikipedia first, then went on to actual books and shit
[1:49:15] <+Undenizen> you need 4
[1:49:16] <Coystick> she scream
[1:49:19] <+AdlerDynamic> it's quite rare from what I read
[1:49:19] <+FlubbedPig> You have 1, you need 4
[1:49:20] <Basic_Birch_> You already have an idol next to the demon bell @WoolieVersus
[1:49:21] <+Grayhammatter> 4 i think?
[1:49:21] <Deasmeister> 3 more
[1:49:21] <ullyzeez> 4
[1:49:24] <+b_aleph> 4]
[1:49:26] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Check the half sunken building with the old lady here if you have not picked one up already
[1:49:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> u need 4 total
[1:49:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, the ladies are weak to Sabimaru's poison.
[1:49:31] <MeMillionthDollar> FAT WAX

[1:49:37] <+yukichocomilk> it's senpo temple isn't it?
[1:49:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> PHAT WAX
[1:49:39] <+Epic_Fubar> A fat cup of wax
[1:49:41] <+krispen_wa> THICC WAX
[1:49:44] <Ashenik1> the suspens for the final boss is killing me LUL
[1:49:49] <%X2Eliah> This enemy droåps two waxes?
[1:49:50] <dds333a> @x2eliah It's most likely not SMT Fiend rare
[1:49:56] <JDebss> Wax on
[1:49:56] <+b_aleph> pat wax
[1:49:56] <Flare3500> Is it like .01 drop rate and fat wax is like 99.99 ?
[1:49:59] <+Freakin_Wolfy> also, you're gonna need those pellets
[1:50:03] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> fat wax is from the senpou monks
[1:50:17] <+ChrisAlgoo> this is also the best money grinding place so that's cool
[1:50:22] <RWLJr98> ResidentSleeper how much money does he need
[1:50:29] <An_Armed_Bear> he needs grave wax
[1:50:36] <%X2Eliah> Farming Day boys
[1:50:38] <RWLJr98> Oh a drop
[1:50:40] <+krispen_wa> rare as in Concords rare?
[1:50:42] <+SouLucha> I hate grinding.
[1:50:45] <+FlubbedPig> There's one you haven't picked up in Sunken Valley, and one in Ashina Outskirts.
[1:50:47] <ullyzeez> lma he gave up
[1:50:51] <+b_aleph> DON'T DO IT
[1:50:53] <%BinaryFireball> whats he grinding for?
[1:50:55] <Deasmeister> Better drops
[1:50:57] <Flare3500> Better Drop rate
[1:51:00] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Just go for the 100% drops listed on Wiki
[1:51:04] <+FlubbedPig> I think you already have the idol to get there.
[1:51:11] <An_Armed_Bear> he wants to get the final fire upgrade
[1:51:13] <%SainEdge> ist fast and you can stop it anytime
[1:51:13] <ullyzeez> @binaryfireball he wants an upgrade thats useless on the final boss
[1:51:16] <RaiNiMayonnaise> senpo temple
[1:51:16] <dds333a> Kinda like TWEWY, in that sense
[1:51:21] <%BinaryFireball> ah ty
[1:51:26] <+FlubbedPig> Senpou Bell Demon's Temple
[1:51:28] <%X2Eliah> Grinding for something that will give better drop rate for better grinding
[1:51:34] <+FlubbedPig> You already have the idol, it was one the menu
[1:51:36] <RaiNiMayonnaise> demon bell you already have access to it
[1:51:39] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You already have the Demon Bell idol, just need to teleport
[1:51:42] <DarkestDawn64> You can already use it.
[1:51:42] <MeMillionthDollar> Golden fan would help farming wax but idk if Woolie has it yet
[1:51:44] <Deasmeister> He has the idol just warp
[1:51:45] <Nanomachiner> It's not even a grind is it, it's just go there and touch it
[1:51:46] <+invida> Bell Demon's temple, you have it unlocked
[1:51:50] <+SouLucha> I almost never took off the demon bell to never have to grind much in this game.
[1:52:03] <Coystick> "Kuro said he likes you, Divine-chan"
[1:52:06] <+FlubbedPig> You used rice, not Fine Snow
[1:52:07] <+MugenSandan> you can only get Fine Snow
[1:52:10] <andre11dr> I do wish this went harder into Buddhism Magical stuff, you spend way more time fighting regular people with swords, at least compared to other games where your fighting wierd monsters way more
[1:52:12] <ullyzeez> kawaii
[1:52:13] <+FackinCrazy> will sacred flame even help with the final boss?
[1:52:16] <Basic_Birch_> You already have the idol next to the demon bell @WoolieVersus
[1:52:16] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can find one Lump of Grave wax near Under-Shrine Valley idol in Sunken Vallley
[1:52:21] <+SouLucha> Even still, that end game has too much grind. I still don't have the platinum cause of those last upgrades.
[1:52:25] <ullyzeez> @fackincrazy no LUL
[1:52:36] <Coystick> Backseat Minhing
[1:52:39] <+izacklok> I hope they make a sequel to this game
[1:52:44] <Ashenik1> did he fight Genichiro ?
[1:53:02] <+FlubbedPig> You need 4 Grave Wax, you have 1.
[1:53:05] <RaiNiMayonnaise> they help but not nothing major
[1:53:07] <+FackinCrazy> @ullyzeez oh lol
[1:53:07] <Flare3500> It has blue flame , he wants Iori flame
[1:53:09] <NumbF4ke> Get it if you want it
[1:53:12] <+b_aleph> @Ashenik1 yes, you need to fight him in the middle of the game to get here LUL
[1:53:16] <+NameInsertable> Was the cheese strat against the final boss ever fixed?
[1:53:23] <%illtima> Forget tools. Go in naked. Best experience.
[1:53:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:53:30] <+FlubbedPig> You need 3, there are 2 you haven't picked up

[1:53:31] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ
[1:53:35] <%X2Eliah> Does something have 100% grave wax drop?
[1:53:37] <%hax_metatron> Flute dudes in Fountainhead drop it
[1:53:52] <%hax_metatron> Not guaranteed but high chance
[1:54:07] <Deasmeister> Flutes are the best shout and even then its rare
[1:54:12] <+FlubbedPig> Left from Sunken Valley idol, yeah
[1:54:27] <rosemon5001> some of the stuff are sneakly hidden
[1:54:33] <+FlubbedPig> Behind you
[1:54:40] <RWLJr98> Wow there are a lot of areas in this game

[1:59:15] <+Kavtech> Fun fact: Not many people realize you actually regain poise faster with your guard up.
[1:59:26] <+FlubbedPig> Might as well just kill it. You have Malcontent

[1:59:44] <Flare3500> Protect your asshole
[1:59:46] <ullyzeez> needs two more
[1:59:52] <pennykettle_> Oh okay, I never knew this area existed, but they threw a common item and reused boss in. I missed nothing. This game is uhhhh
[2:00:00] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> I love the idea of the Headless, but man is the execution here bad.
[2:00:03] <andre11dr> Right these guys are so horseshit
[2:00:15] <mobile_suit> you can run around under the purple umbrella vs these guys, it completely trivializes them
[2:00:20] <+FlubbedPig> Malcontent that bitch
[2:00:25] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus The area before the demon of hatred has one that you did not pick up

[2:01:29] <srv4254> its a great game people whine tho
[2:01:33] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Another one should be in the Ashina Outskirts, near the end of the zone close to one of the sniper towers
[2:01:33] <%X2Eliah> Ok two more waxes
[2:01:34] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus The lazulite axe is super useful against the corrupted monk and lady butterfly
[2:01:40] <MeMillionthDollar> That good golden grass man
[2:01:46] <zocano> This is amongst my favorite fromsoft games
[2:01:54] <zocano> Maybe second favorite only to Demon's Souls
[2:01:57] <+AdlerDynamic> @RWLJr98 my personal favorite fromsoft game
[2:01:58] <+FlubbedPig> Should be another Grave Wax in Outskirts by a sniper tower further in. There's an ogre near it.
[2:02:00] <MeMillionthDollar> @zocano Same here bud
[2:02:15] <deceitfulgemini> what's woolie hunting for???
[2:02:17] <marumiyan1> flaws aside it scratches my souls itch, so its a good game imo
[2:02:24] <%X2Eliah> @deceitfulgemini granny wax
[2:02:25] <linSP> The fatty ghosts give infinite use sugars
[2:02:26] <pennykettle_> This game is their best visually but in every other aspect it feels like their first game where they learn everything they did in all their other games
[2:02:28] <zocano> It's a 30 hour class where the final boss is your exit exam
[2:02:38] <andre11dr> @rwljr98 Depends on what you want, if you want a cool stealth action ninja game it's really good, but if you want a RPG with loads of replayability it not really that
[2:02:43] <zocano> And it's *wonderful*
[2:02:56] <MeMillionthDollar> @zocano I'd retake the exam ANYDAY
[2:02:59] <@Solidus_113> did he ever get the mask fragments?
[2:03:15] <+LeaIsChill> Motto of the LP : Cut here for grinding?
[2:03:22] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Use Golden Vortex and Demon bell for extra drops to save time , you have the Demon bell idol
[2:03:22] <RWLJr98> @andre11dr is there NG?
[2:03:25] <+FlubbedPig> The sniper tower one is further in. You ran past it on your way to Demon
[2:03:26] <ullyzeez> @leaischill LUL
[2:03:28] <MeMillionthDollar> Behind the Grind
[2:03:28] <zocano> @MeMillionthDollar It's a god damn wonderful boss
[2:03:30] <dds333a> In the future, now
[2:03:34] <+Mrbaconator> time travel Pog
[2:03:45] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus You can find one in the area before Demon of hatred
[2:03:54] <andre11dr> @rwljr98 Yes there is and you get a boss rush too
[2:04:16] <+FackinCrazy> might as well get that last bead
[2:04:20] <%SainEdge> yes anytime
[2:04:23] <ullyzeez> yes
[2:04:30] <pennykettle_> Yea the demon bell is applied when you hold the item. When you USE the item it goes away and you come back here to get it back
[2:04:37] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its slightly harder game for extra drops, not as hard as Bonfire Ascetic
[2:04:42] <emeraldskrull> Full Sigma woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[2:04:46] <jamox1> Woolie still hasn’t gotten to the final boss right?
[2:04:50] <+Grayhammatter> SINISTER BURDEN
[2:04:51] <samuelfisk> No
[2:04:52] <%X2Eliah> "more chance of getting drops" so more enemies?
[2:04:58] <+FlubbedPig> The other headless is in the cave behind here
[2:05:03] <sperium3000> No it just kicks your game to new game + basically
[2:05:04] <+LeaIsChill> @jamox1 No, but he did post a picture of him on Twitter
[2:05:09] <DeathByPoke7> looks like soul edge
[2:05:10] <Flare3500> Better Spoils there ya go
[2:05:12] <pennykettle_> When you beat the game 1 time, you do unlock an actual hard mode in addition to this
[2:05:12] <andre11dr> I don't remember this bell at all
[2:05:16] <jamox1> Ahhh I see
[2:05:18] <Flare3500> He was here 2 years ago
[2:05:20] <samuelfisk> Woolie has Cheap Trick
[2:05:23] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure i missed this
[2:05:27] <jamox1> Damn I guess it’s hard to avoid seeing it beforehand
[2:05:29] <sperium3000> It's kinda useless to do it so late in the game, but hey if you didn't know, now you know
[2:05:36] <jamox1> I’m still hype as hell to see his live reaction to it though
[2:05:38] <RWLJr98> Doesn’t ring a bell Kappa
[2:05:46] <+b_aleph> Do the last boss with the bell on!
[2:05:49] <Flare3500> Minh has not played any souls game ?
[2:05:54] <dds333a> @samuelfisk just sitting on his back, being annoying
[2:06:01] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If you want you can check that half sunken building with the old lady to make super you got that grave wax
[2:06:19] <+FlubbedPig> No, grave wax is the rarer version of fat wax
[2:06:19] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You dont have Golden Vortex prostethic i assume then?
[2:06:23] <RWLJr98> He said he played surge I think
[2:06:36] <+Grayhammatter> that's a fan upgrade
[2:06:36] <+FlubbedPig> It's a Fan upgrade you don't have.
[2:06:41] <Spearweaver> he doesn't have golden vortex chat
[2:06:46] <ullyzeez> its when you spin while peeing
[2:06:55] <MeMillionthDollar> LUL
[2:06:58] <Flare3500> Woolies not a fan of it I guess
[2:07:01] <%hax_metatron> RIP Jessica Walter (Lucille Bluth from Arrested Development)
[2:07:06] <pennykettle_> Yeaaa
[2:07:08] <jamox1> I just got in btw

[2:07:26] <brunoberserk> holy shit , the bell is really good
[2:07:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:07:27] <+Grayhammatter> now time to discard that bell
[2:07:28] <RaiNiMayonnaise> its nice when things go as planned
[2:07:28] <dds333a> @rwljr98 I think he was talking about the "actual" Souls game
[2:07:30] <+Awkward_Cyborg> okane
[2:07:34] <%X2Eliah> gotta get them pennies
[2:07:36] <Deasmeister> Remember to get rid of demon
[2:07:42] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Dont forget to use the Bell to get rid of it
[2:07:45] <fritz_dacat> got 5 haircut at the same time
[2:07:48] <+FlubbedPig> Sell some items to the Info Broker
[2:07:56] <MeMillionthDollar> No, Woolie will forget to get rid of demon
[2:07:56] <jamox1> Oh we farming gold
[2:07:58] <andre11dr> BITCH BETTER HAVE MA MO9

[2:07:59] <lioxor> where are they on the game , chot?
[2:08:07] <ullyzeez> sell pebbles or some shit
[2:08:09] <+SouLucha> Bell demon is the best. Only took it off for bosses cause I'm not a masochist.
[2:08:14] <samuelfisk> Just before the final boss
[2:08:16] <pennykettle_> @lioxor about to do last boss
[2:08:17] <Spearweaver> farming for final upgrades before final boss
[2:08:22] <DarkestDawn64> TURN OFF DEMON BELL.
[2:08:29] <andre11dr> No
[2:08:35] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can pop Money Ballons to speed this also
[2:08:36] <pennykettle_> I think hes waiting to do bell after he gets money
[2:08:38] <lioxor> alrigth, thaks colective of the chat
[2:08:39] <Flare3500> Woolie fighting the final boss with the demon bell
[2:08:49] <%ihavesillyknees> Freaking AD IS A MINUTE LONG
[2:08:50] <+b_aleph> keep the bell, don't be a coward!
[2:08:52] <dds333a> I think he'll be fine
[2:08:54] <andre11dr> Don't tell him, let him fight it with the bell on LUL
[2:08:57] <deceitfulgemini> oooo fuckin stylish
[2:09:09] <jamox1> SSS
[2:09:16] <RaiNiMayonnaise> turn off demon bell
[2:09:26] <marumiyan1> its his last fight, might as well have it on?
[2:09:28] <Flare3500> Alright time to end this sessions and pick it up next week , next level blue ball
[2:09:34] <X2Eliah> ...
[2:09:38] <%X2Eliah> eeeeh
[2:09:38] <+SouLucha> It'll be funny if he forgets.
[2:09:42] <Deasmeister> eeh
[2:09:43] <dds333a> yeaj
[2:09:44] <%hax_metatron> You get Divine Confetti
[2:09:45] <+FlubbedPig> Sacred Flame is a side-grade from Okinaga's flame.
[2:09:45] <%hax_metatron> Not fire
[2:09:45] <DarkestDawn64> You can use the fire to cover your blade in flame.
[2:09:48] <ullyzeez> uhhh sure
[2:09:57] <pennykettle_> what was that description? It doesnt deal fire dmage?
[2:10:01] <+JD0394> Don’t tell him chat
[2:10:12] <Johannen> @DarkestDawn64 That requires living weapon i assume
[2:10:19] <RWLJr98> Admit it, it’s just your OCD that made you want the fire upgrade
[2:10:21] <DarkestDawn64> Right, I forgot.
[2:10:24] <RaiNiMayonnaise> the lazurite flame is used with living force for free confetti effect
[2:10:28] <pennykettle_> lets go, boys
[2:10:31] <brunoberserk> dont forget the bell woolie
[2:10:36] <dds333a> play us out
[2:10:41] <Ashenik1> wat are we farming for ?
[2:10:44] <%hax_metatron> Divine confetti
[2:10:46] <Stari> Don't forget the bell demon
[2:10:50] <Flare3500> It got worse , Iori's flame are indeed weaker
[2:10:51] <+cubbywolf> like all dark souls, we grind mindlessly before the final boss
[2:10:54] <Spearweaver> ats an anti-ghost flame
[2:10:57] <jamox1> Wait wait wait blue fire sword???
[2:11:00] <Dave_VD> Did he beat DOH?
[2:11:03] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus If you have the skill "Living force" You can use it to get a purple flame sword without spending confetti
[2:11:04] <rosemon5001> purp flame
[2:11:13] <brunoberserk> iori's flame
[2:11:13] <andre11dr> You Iori now
[2:11:16] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Sacred Flame is a side-grade from Okinaga's Flame Vent, not a raw upgrade. It deals bonus damage to Apparitions like Demon of Hatred.
[2:11:19] <+b_aleph> Quit yapping baout the bell, let him be a brave fool!
[2:11:24] <dds333a> @cubbywolf to an extent, anyway
[2:11:28] <%hax_metatron> Do R1 after the flame
[2:11:33] <ullyzeez> wow that was so worth it
[2:11:38] <%hax_metatron> It's also a damage boost
[2:11:44] <Timarkot> New game+ tool?
[2:11:48] <+JD0394> @woolieversus the blue fire does slightly more damage than regular fire but the fire status effect is well worth the damage reduction. Use regular fire
[2:11:49] <andre11dr> It's didn't even do that much damage LUL
[2:11:55] <+penjaza> Try the attack after it
[2:11:57] <+OblivionSword1> @hax_metatron he doesn't have that skill
[2:12:01] <%hax_metatron> Ah
[2:12:04] <Johannen> Some of the upgrades are sidegrades actually
[2:12:05] <%hax_metatron> Bummer oh well
[2:12:12] <Indigo_Automaton> @penjaza I don't think he has Living Force
[2:12:13] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Genichiro time
[2:12:22] <pennykettle_> Chat, what is the coolest flame color? Black?
[2:12:30] <dds333a> this is similar to the concept of "spiritfire"
[2:12:31] <+AdlerDynamic> so is woolie taking on the final boss?
[2:12:33] <+FlubbedPig> Yeah, you want to head to Ashina Reservoir.
[2:12:37] <ullyzeez> @pennykettle_ no thats sasukes
[2:12:38] <andre11dr> Great Combustion does like double the damage for way less efort LUL
[2:12:38] <Johannen> Blue Flames are the coolest
[2:12:41] <Ashenik1> its blue casue Azula
[2:12:41] <+JD0394> Fire in this game stops enemies from recovering stamina. Super good for bosses if you can give them the burn status effect
[2:12:42] <RaiNiMayonnaise> blue
[2:12:43] <Indigo_Automaton> @pennykettle_ Chernkov Radiation Blue
[2:12:44] <jamox1> Oh we leaving the bell on??? Hell yeah!!!
[2:12:44] <+FlubbedPig> Might as well kill the Spear Guy and get another Bead.
[2:12:46] <dds333a> White flames
[2:12:50] <+b_aleph> purple
[2:12:53] <+SouLucha> "Genichiro" is kinda a ghostly dead guy by this point.
[2:12:54] <brunoberserk> he gonna fight with the bell on ? ABSOLUTE MADMAN
[2:12:57] <%X2Eliah> Silver flames
[2:12:59] <+SouLucha> Right?
[2:13:03] <jamox1> Green flames with a bit of black are badass
[2:13:03] <Spearweaver> red
[2:13:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @StarlessAH
[2:13:14] <ullyzeez> chat is losing their mind over the bell LUL
[2:13:18] <andre11dr> Chat, let him do it with the bell
[2:13:22] <redrins> you can cheese this dude
[2:13:29] <jamox1> I want him to do it with the bell
[2:13:29] <+cubbywolf> GIMME YO HEALTH
[2:13:31] <andre11dr> IT'S THE TRUE WAY
[2:13:35] <lotharrio> I cheesed most of the bosses.
[2:13:35] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:13:37] <jamox1> Woolie is the STRONGEST
[2:13:39] <+SouLucha> I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL
[2:13:39] <StarlessAH> Come on and SLAM and welcome to the JAM
[2:13:40] <+AdlerDynamic> final prayer bead time
[2:13:40] <+FlubbedPig> I believe Woolie's still missing 4 beads. This'll give him his 9th Necklace, there's 10 in total.
[2:13:40] <marumiyan1> OH NO
[2:13:42] <CoffeeSlice> aww
[2:13:44] <MeMillionthDollar> BELL OFF
[2:13:47] <+b_aleph> GODDAMN YOU CHAT
[2:13:47] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit LUL
[2:13:47] <%X2Eliah> BACKDOWN
[2:13:52] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:13:52] <%BinaryFireball> sshhh
[2:13:54] <andre11dr> AHHH FUCK
[2:13:56] <%JaseAdrift> COWARD
[2:13:56] <+cubbywolf> is that what the bell does, gives you a demon you can turn on and off?
[2:13:59] <KingOfTheGeats> chat was real subtle about it
[2:14:02] <Timarkot> Why was it on in the first place?
[2:14:03] <lotharrio> Praying Strikes are surprisingly great.
[2:14:04] <RaiNiMayonnaise> its a 2 vs 1 prepare accordingly
[2:14:05] <Indigo_Automaton> No need for the whistle
[2:14:06] <jamox1> Rip
[2:14:11] <andre11dr> CHAT THAT WAS YOUR FAULT
[2:14:15] <ullyzeez> this fight sucks
[2:14:17] <slix3431> Unlock your weeb energy
[2:14:20] <+FlubbedPig> Switch off Malcontent too
[2:14:23] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[2:14:29] <RaiNiMayonnaise> or just skip this fight entirely LUL LUL
[2:14:30] <pixelkenj> did we lose our sin
[2:14:33] <mobile_suit> you can actually puppeteer the second guy if you run up with stealth sugar
[2:14:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ever used Mist Raven?
[2:14:43] <Flare3500> You can stealth the jobber to fight the dude legit
[2:14:44] <%X2Eliah> Ok @WoolieVersus time to do a Naruto
[2:14:46] <+JD0394> Shrunken flame vent and firecrackers
[2:14:50] <+b_aleph> oOoOoOoOo dOnNt ForgEt aBoUt tHE bELl
[2:14:55] <pennykettle_> I loved Mist Raven
[2:15:10] <+penjaza> @mobile_suit He might be scarred from the last time we told him to try that
[2:15:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Puppeteer was basically the only special I ever used
[2:15:13] <+cubbywolf> SAMURAI TIME
[2:15:14] <andre11dr> @x2eliah You can't throw magic nukes in this game
[2:15:18] <+parag0nl0st> doodTaco
[2:15:22] <jamox1> Puppeteer?
[2:15:27] <%ChoculaUltra> oof that reach
[2:15:31] <+JD0394> Good luck using sabimaru against genichiro LUL
[2:15:32] <%jinking79> finally how much i missed
[2:15:33] <ullyzeez> sick
[2:15:33] <RaiNiMayonnaise> kill the minion first
[2:15:38] <%X2Eliah> Man they really love tag-team boss battles in Sekiro
[2:15:41] <dds333a> just don't do it right into him
[2:15:45] <+SouLucha> I like the complicated cheese for these guys.
[2:15:46] <Johannen> You can totaly stealth kill the normal general
[2:15:46] <Coystick> Digital Foundry's 60fps Bloodborne vid hurts
[2:15:51] <RWLJr98> Get fucked
[2:15:51] <+krispen_wa> is this Throne watcher and throne defender
[2:15:54] <+Grayhammatter> this fight is a pain in the ass

[2:15:56] <+FlubbedPig> There's a sleeping soldier on the left that you can Puppeteer. Turn it into a 2v2
[2:15:57] <RaiNiMayonnaise> ornstein and smough (but bad)
[2:16:00] <+cubbywolf> immediately dies LUL
[2:16:03] <samuelfisk> Nioh was the worst with tag teams
[2:16:04] <brunoberserk> AGNI AND RUDRA
[2:16:09] <+yukichocomilk> this fight is super hard
[2:16:09] <MeMillionthDollar> Cheese?
[2:16:13] <+JD0394> @woolieversus Puppeteer 👀
[2:16:14] <Flare3500> You can stealth the jobber
[2:16:14] <+patel347> this fight should be cheesed
[2:16:16] <dds333a> oucj
[2:16:21] <+krispen_wa> Thank god Nioh 2 has no duo bosses
[2:16:24] <+FlubbedPig> There's a soldier on the left you can puppeteer
[2:16:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> there are multiple cheeses
[2:16:25] <+SouLucha> Bloodmist.
[2:16:25] <+cubbywolf> the shinobi way is the cheesey way
[2:16:26] <MeMillionthDollar> The NPC is Cheesing YOU!
[2:16:26] <%BinaryFireball> you can kill one but I forget how
[2:16:26] <ullyzeez> RUN AWAY LUL
[2:16:28] <%X2Eliah> DONT CHEESE
[2:16:35] <+parag0nl0st> StinkyCheese
[2:16:36] <+SouLucha> I bloodmist cheese them
[2:16:40] <GilliamYaeger> @krispen_wa Gozuki/Mezuki don't exist?
[2:16:40] <+patel347> you need to pop a pill and then you can cheese
[2:16:41] <marumiyan1> nioh 1 duo bosses were fine...just sloth the other
[2:16:42] <+cubbywolf> its muddy water
[2:16:46] <%ChoculaUltra> brutal
[2:16:48] <Coystick> Love these two loyalists
[2:16:49] <pennykettle_> This game's combat only works on 1 enemy at a time? Two different unavoidable attacks at the same time that require different responses? Nah, throw it in the game it's fine
[2:16:49] <RWLJr98> Ultimate cheese is turn the game off Keepo
[2:16:51] <pixelkenj> nap in the burning pile
[2:16:53] <+krispen_wa> @gilliamyaeger forgot about them, but they're jokes anyways
[2:16:54] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I literally only beat this one because one of them fell off the map
[2:17:06] <pixelkenj> @Freakin_Wolfy SeemsGood
[2:17:23] <%X2Eliah> Ultimate cheese is watchin an LP insteado f doing it yourself
[2:17:28] <dds333a> they'll wait
[2:17:29] <RWLJr98> They hate that
[2:17:34] <+cubbywolf> bonk spear
[2:17:57] <andre11dr> For as much as Sekiro loves duo bosses, nothing here goes as hard as Demon Prince
[2:18:00] <+cubbywolf> doesnt the other guy just have 1 bar of lfie?
[2:18:06] <RaiNiMayonnaise> this fight isnt fun
[2:18:10] <%hax_metatron> Demon Prince is so easy though
[2:18:14] <+krispen_wa> imagine if souls bosses were allowed to hurt each other accidentally with their attacks
[2:18:19] <Coystick> Those two could've oneshot DoH
[2:18:19] <+AdlerDynamic> I used the finger to pull one over and then backstab him
[2:18:24] <+FlubbedPig> Puppeteer the sleeping soldier on the left.
[2:18:25] <+SouLucha> The Sword Guy has one bar, so you can puppet him or mist him.
[2:18:29] <+patel347> theres a cheese tactic where you can pupateer one
[2:18:29] <+krispen_wa> demon prince is just "stay on their balls"
[2:18:29] <Indigo_Automaton> @andre11dr Demon Prince is easy though
[2:18:31] <pixelkenj> this fight really did feel like a "do you know how to cheese one of them" quiz
[2:18:34] <+krispen_wa> theyre just super tanky
[2:18:39] <%Mathochism> Sekiro's cool and all, but, REAL HYPE, can we talk about the new Melty Blood game that got announced?
[2:18:41] <+cubbywolf> oh no they both have 2
[2:18:43] <Johannen> @andre11dr Most of the duo encounters are easily negated by stealth
[2:18:46] <+SouLucha> Then there's just another regular guy sitting there, I used him for a second bloodmist.
[2:18:47] <+JD0394> @woolieversus use puppeteer
[2:18:52] <mobile_suit> @cubbywolf the second guy only has 1 bar
[2:18:58] <Flare3500> Here's two different unaavoidable attack at the same time
[2:18:59] <RWLJr98> Rekt
[2:19:00] <dds333a> that. was fast
[2:19:00] <jamox1> What is puppeteer?
[2:19:05] <%BinaryFireball> I thought one guy did only have 1 bar?
[2:19:09] <mobile_suit> yes
[2:19:13] <+JD0394> It lets you take control of an enemy
[2:19:21] <jamox1> That’s hella sick
[2:19:27] <+JD0394> It’s great here
[2:19:27] <andre11dr> @indigo_automaton I didn't say it was the hardest, but i think it's definitely the best executed duo boss fight
[2:19:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I feel like you're supposed to cheese this kind of thing in this game. I real shinobi would cheese them hard
[2:19:32] <Coystick> That spear is fucking huge tho
[2:19:32] <+Grayhammatter> his minion has only one health, bar yes
[2:19:32] <jamox1> Is that a whistle upgrade?
[2:19:35] <+krispen_wa> is the 7 ashina spears a reference to Hideyoshi's 7 spears?
[2:19:39] <SilverFaustX> reminder psn has free games out today
[2:19:48] <+invalid_robin> If you parry the move after mikiri countering the stab it's a big stagger
[2:19:48] <+JD0394> It’s one of the backstab moves
[2:19:49] <jamox1> Oh hype thanks!
[2:19:51] <+cubbywolf> I used the feathers the most
[2:19:52] <KingOfTheGeats> I didn't bother doing this fight fair
[2:19:54] <+JD0394> Like the blood mist one
[2:19:57] <+cubbywolf> feathers are so OP but people dont know that
[2:19:58] <jamox1> That’s rad

[2:20:49] <+Grayhammatter> NO honor
[2:20:50] <+yukichocomilk> it's annoying af LUL
[2:20:51] <An_Armed_Bear> This fight has NO HONOR

[2:20:53] <linSP> POCKET SAND
[2:20:57] <+JD0394> @woolieversus Puppeteer!!!
[2:20:58] <JetpackMcQuack> Nail those mikiris
[2:20:59] <+cubbywolf> omg look at the other guy
[2:20:59] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus Eat Sugar , Crouch , go to the left to the jobber and instakill the jobber
[2:21:04] <samuelfisk> Gachin’s sugar. Then Ninjutsu.
[2:21:06] <andre11dr> STEALTH GOON AND USE PUPPET
[2:21:07] <%Lion_kun> It's called stealth
[2:21:09] <Canadian_Suit> i just came in, how many bosses did woolie beat since the start of the stream?
[2:21:09] <Dave_VD> Good way of describing it
[2:21:10] <Raldavar> cause that's his ninja way
[2:21:10] <ullyzeez> pray one falls off
[2:21:10] <+FlubbedPig> Not an item
[2:21:23] <mobile_suit> "cheese" is misleading, it's a method of engagement
[2:21:24] <Indigo_Automaton> It does sorta seem like these guys were just arbitrarily dropped in this spot because they needed to put them somewhere before the end
[2:21:24] <wibbwobbler> that weird tooth thing i think
[2:21:26] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus All problems are solved by stealth
[2:21:26] <Coystick> Throw money at them, PAY TO WIN
[2:21:29] <ullyzeez> money LUK
[2:21:34] <+JD0394> Yeah its not really a cheese
[2:21:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:21:37] <andre11dr> Not an item, it's a move
[2:21:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> stealth sugar + puppeteer, OR you can just sit on the branch and poke them until the die/fall
[2:21:46] <Dave_VD> This flight gives you an opportunity to try unique strats
[2:21:46] <+cubbywolf> just fight them both and win gawd
[2:21:50] <wibbwobbler> noice
[2:21:54] <CoffeeSlice> ahahaha
[2:21:56] <JDebss> It's cool
[2:21:58] <+SouLucha> @mobile_suit I agree, this is not cheese. It's strategy.
[2:22:00] <VJdarkworld> PowerUpR
[2:22:00] <Flare3500> Just Crouch Woolie
[2:22:01] <An_Armed_Bear> eat a stealth candy
[2:22:04] <marumiyan1> NO HONOUR
[2:22:04] <ullyzeez> just get good woolie omg
[2:22:04] <lotharrio> You can use the whistle to draw in the henchman for a stealth and then have an honest fight.
[2:22:06] <Flare3500> plus the stealth the candy
[2:22:08] <samuelfisk> Alternatively, Bloodmist
[2:22:12] <+cubbywolf> WOW the back down is real
[2:22:24] <%HeroToxiko> method one sounds like using hidden body and rapport in souls, LUL
[2:22:40] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Third strategy: there's a jobber on the left. Puppeteer him, fight is now 2v2
[2:22:40] <+SouLucha> What you want HONOR on a two vs one? Get fucked. I'mma watch you fight your bro.
[2:22:43] <Johannen> Crazy Talk Mihn..its super easy
[2:22:46] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean it is a ninja game - gotta be real scummy once in a while LUL
[2:22:46] <Coystick> lure them with ceramics or whistle?
[2:22:48] <+cubbywolf> gotta go in between
[2:22:49] <%BinaryFireball> gachin and stealth kill 1 bar man
[2:22:50] <ullyzeez> no right side left woolZ
[2:22:56] <+cubbywolf> the guy you cant get LUL

[2:22:59] <CoffeeSlice> woolie
[2:22:59] <+Grayhammatter> oh no LUL
[2:23:00] <Flare3500> That's the puzzle

[2:23:04] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:23:06] <+b_aleph> lul

[2:23:19] <+cubbywolf> yeyeyeye
[2:23:22] <+patel347> use puppateer
[2:23:24] <Coystick> DO IT COOL
[2:23:25] <+yukichocomilk> LUL
[2:23:26] <Basic_Birch_> Bloodsmoke is really op if you know where to use it
[2:23:26] <pixelkenj> Okay but what if: a fight with TWO gyoubu masataka oniwas
[2:23:30] <+AdlerDynamic> nah, one is just a beefy henchman
[2:23:34] <+cubbywolf> well he's a boss henchmen with only 1 life bar
[2:23:36] <rosemon5001> that looks like a moonlight spear lol
[2:23:44] <Dave_VD> I always used the guy sitting there to make a bloodsmoke cloud. No suger required that way
[2:23:46] <+b_aleph> there's another spear a kuro's tower too
[2:23:47] <+SouLucha> I used double Bloodmist. Just end this quickly.
[2:23:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Ornstein and guy
[2:23:52] <Flare3500> They're back to back and apparently blind I guess
[2:23:54] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Equip pupper Jutsu
[2:23:57] <lotharrio> Ornstein and Roy.
[2:24:11] <Flare3500> Ornstein and Some GUY
[2:24:11] <Coystick> Yeyeyeyeey
[2:24:19] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL he's been there the whole time
[2:24:22] <Canadian_Suit> did woolie beat the optional fire boss?
[2:24:25] <marumiyan1> he's watching you getting bodied
[2:24:25] <mobile_suit> yes
[2:24:27] <+krispen_wa> yes
[2:24:30] <%hax_metatron> Is this a Jojo reference?
[2:24:35] <Coystick> I fucking love infighting
[2:24:36] <+SouLucha> He's just a bloodbag.
[2:24:37] <%hax_metatron> STAND: SURFACE
[2:24:45] <andre11dr> Imagine if you had to fight all the Knight if Gwin at once, that would be fuckin rough

[2:25:46] <pixelkenj> i wonder what the game would be like with infinite ash clumps
[2:25:50] <+SouLucha> @WoolieVersus use the guy sitting on the floor for a bloodmist or puppet
[2:26:04] <thefranchise00> mikiri counter is quite good against this guy
[2:26:07] <An_Armed_Bear> I like how these guys resist the thrust counter
[2:26:11] <Johannen> @SouLucha I dont think he has vaulting over tech so he cant

[2:27:19] <+patel347> yeah he was old af
[2:27:19] <mobile_suit> isshins coup happened a long time ago
[2:27:21] <Indigo_Automaton> They were talking about his original coup from the beginning of the game
[2:27:26] <RaiNiMayonnaise> ashina is being invaded
[2:27:27] <Deasmeister> That was years ago
[2:27:28] <Flare3500> Some people defected
[2:27:31] <Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[2:27:31] <Basic_Birch_> Ishins coup happened before the game
[2:27:32] <+Freakin_Wolfy> oh yeah, I forgot he just upped and died in the top tower
[2:27:32] <VJdarkworld> ASHINA WILL RISE AGAIN TheIlluminati
[2:27:32] <andre11dr> No these guys are the Ministry
[2:27:33] <moeartifact> genichiro's coup against isshin
[2:27:34] <pennykettle_> This place is in a cycle of constant war
[2:27:34] <+SouLucha> Isshin is just refusing to bend the knee.
[2:27:35] <%hax_metatron> They're defending Ashina
[2:27:36] <Coystick> Yeah these are Ishin's lands & people
[2:27:37] <%sirisvirus> isshin's coup was the opening cinematic
[2:27:37] <brunoberserk> yes
[2:27:37] <mobile_suit> those 2 were fighting the ministry
[2:27:38] <%SainEdge> yes
[2:27:39] <samuelfisk> This is the shogun coming back.
[2:27:39] <Spearweaver> this is the ministry getting revenge for ishhin's coup
[2:27:41] <CoffeeSlice> yea
[2:27:41] <MeMillionthDollar> I'll take it
[2:27:41] <RaiNiMayonnaise> kinda just go with that
[2:27:42] <pixelkenj> the ministry was just scared shitless of Isshin until he was old and dying
[2:27:44] <Basic_Birch_> Yes
[2:27:45] <Deasmeister> Yep
[2:27:45] <$Rumbutt> Isshin's shit was the cutscenes in the beginning
[2:27:46] <%dreadedcthulhu> ... woolie is from Quebec and can't pronounce coup correctly...
[2:27:46] <%hax_metatron> MINH LOL
[2:27:47] <+Mr_Pylon> there are... 3 coups?
[2:27:47] <+AdlerDynamic> Isshin and the ministry fought against each other
[2:27:48] <watts121> Seven Spears worked of Isshin
[2:27:52] <marumiyan1> inshina?
[2:27:54] <+Grayhammatter> BIG bar
[2:27:55] <ullyzeez> huh genichiro really is Make Ashina Great Again
[2:27:56] <Flare3500> They' betrayed Isshin
[2:27:57] <RWLJr98> Nice
[2:27:58] <+AdlerDynamic> the ministry is only invading because isshin is weak and old
[2:28:01] <Timarkot> Woolie will crush it
[2:28:02] <matteasyplays> LETS GOOOO
[2:28:04] <Indigo_Automaton> MAX POWER
[2:28:05] <An_Armed_Bear> Ministry lamed it out

[2:28:10] <VJdarkworld> !MOTIVATED
[2:28:11] <@Moobot> 2146 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:28:13] <andre11dr> The Ministry works for the Emperor aka Nobunaga
[2:28:13] <Coystick> Isshin is a big dick warlord screaming state's rights
[2:28:15] <zocano> And it's the fucking sickest shit in the world
[2:28:16] <+invalid_robin> FINAL BOSS TIME
[2:28:16] <lotharrio> The entire region refuses to bow to the central government, and the ministry is here to burn this hellhole to the ground. There's also a separate coup going on that is the main story.
[2:28:17] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Ministry = evil. Ashina = jerks
[2:28:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is the ministry who ishin rebelled from?
[2:28:18] <brunoberserk> HUGE QUEST
[2:28:26] <+Pinkiefan> Did I miss him fighting DoH?
[2:28:29] <matteasyplays> \o/ give woolie your energy
[2:28:30] <+DragonArt07> has woolie seen the optional boss?
[2:28:33] <andre11dr> Yes

[2:29:10] <deceitfulgemini> oh fuck
[2:29:13] <lotharrio> So much content. Lasts multiple years.
[2:29:20] <RWLJr98> He didn’t help though. So he was complacent to violence
[2:29:22] <+Pinkiefan> Start the death counter.
[2:29:22] <+Freakin_Wolfy> he's been playing this for two years????
[2:29:30] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Still yet to beat or see Shura ending/Phase 2 Ishin
[2:29:33] <andre11dr> Yeah LUL
[2:29:36] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus So have you just decided not to bother going back and doing the Shura Ending final boss?
[2:29:43] <samazam94> Binal Foss
[2:29:44] <RaiNiMayonnaise> worth it
[2:29:44] <RWLJr98> Yes, he couldn’t beat it after 2 years of nonstop play
[2:29:46] <marumiyan1> pellets good deal
[2:29:47] <watts121> well..I guess the Ministry could also technically be Hideyoshi
[2:29:49] <@Menitta> Damnit
[2:29:53] <+Freakin_Wolfy> in his defense, I've gotten to the final boss on two separate playthroughs but never beat them

[2:40:50] <jorniev> FEAR IS THE MIND KILLER
[2:40:51] <marumiyan1> DEATH IS NO DISGRACE
[2:40:51] <%hax_metatron> BEAT GENICHIRO WITHOUT HEALING
[2:40:55] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus MIST RAVEN
[2:40:57] <Flare3500> Don't be scared pussy
[2:41:00] <jamox1> Go HARD
[2:41:00] <+Pinkiefan> Death Count:2
[2:41:01] <emeraldskrull> winning is defeat
[2:41:02] <SoulKarl> this fight is a bitch specifically because of genichiro at the start
[2:41:03] <mobile_suit> Hesitation is Defeat.
[2:41:03] <$Rumbutt> At least Genichiro doesn't have Lions
[2:41:04] <Basic_Birch_> what a cool name for a boss
[2:41:05] <pennykettle_> Genichiro again because meh
[2:41:09] <RWLJr98> It’s cool that he just seems purely difficult, not just hard because of one shots.
[2:41:10] <Coystick> "That wasn't so bad, just let me unprolapse my asshole real quick"
[2:41:11] <%ChoculaUltra> double mortal blade 2 monkaS
[2:41:12] <andre11dr> Also this is a 4 phase boss fight btw
[2:41:15] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Canadian_Suit shhhhh
[2:41:16] <SoulKarl> he is such a diferent fight that you forget his moveset entirely while learning ishins, and vice versa
[2:41:22] <pennykettle_> Genichiro is the Kylo Ren of Sekiro
[2:41:23] <Flare3500> I mean if you drink at genichiro it's a sign you're not ready
[2:41:26] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Gneichiro is literally just resurrection refil LUL LUL
[2:41:30] <Th3rd3> Genichiro is angy
[2:41:30] <+FlubbedPig> That's Mortal Draw, baby
[2:41:32] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:41:36] <Ashenik1> the point of this game is to be master at beating the shit out of genichiro
[2:41:40] <spawnzie> pretty sure you can jump it at the right angle
[2:41:40] <+kieranmusic> Is this Woolies first go at this Ishin? I’m late sorry
[2:41:44] <GilliamYaeger> Yes
[2:41:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> eventually genichiro becomes a joke
[2:41:45] <+krispen_wa> yes
[2:41:46] <%BinaryFireball> you can be super agressive against genchiro
[2:41:48] <jamox1> Yeah
[2:41:49] <GilliamYaeger> Second go actually but yes
[2:41:55] <Ultimatefool> Genichiro = Vergil, Isshin = Mundus
[2:42:00] <+AdlerDynamic> @Ashenik1 genichiro beating simulator
[2:42:05] <slppanther29> Genichiro is just a test to see if your ready for Isshin
[2:42:08] <SoulKarl> @kieranmusic hes seen genichiro + phase1 ishin
[2:42:09] <+krispen_wa> is this genichiro easier than normal genichiro, health bars aside
[2:42:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If he kills you, and then you revive and win the fight, you get your res back for isshin
[2:42:14] <GilliamYaeger> @Ultimatefool You mean Isshin = Sparda
[2:42:25] <An_Armed_Bear> I'm so happy From finally put the toughest/best boss at the end for once.
[2:42:26] <Flare3500> Beat Genichiro like you beat your dick
[2:42:27] <%SainEdge> fist he will turn into a joke, than you fuck up again because you get impatient and then you beat the boss LUL
[2:42:42] <pixelkenj> Genichiro needs more POWER
[2:42:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:42:46] <+kieranmusic> @soulkarl sweet thanks
[2:42:50] <+krispen_wa> @an_armed_bear gehrman was the best base game boss in BB
[2:42:51] <MeMillionthDollar> Not Bad
[2:42:57] <RWLJr98> Bruh, just shoot him in the face 4Head
[2:43:02] <pixelkenj> skip genichiro lolol
[2:43:07] <CoffeeSlice> ahahaha
[2:43:10] <An_Armed_Bear> I guess he can be the final boss yeah
[2:43:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's literally using that sword to use Edo Tensei on Isshin
[2:43:15] <+SouLucha> RESPECT
[2:43:17] <spawnzie> that's a stun
[2:43:18] <%AmuserName> OwO
[2:43:19] <Ashenik1> when you fight Ishin the music fo some reason reminds me of Naruto ;d
[2:43:20] <An_Armed_Bear> He definitely feels more final than Moon Presence
[2:43:27] <Flare3500> Negative frames can't block
[2:43:30] <slppanther29> I like how this fight is technically 4 phases
[2:43:40] <SoulKarl> for real though does anyone know what his sword strength is at?
[2:43:43] <+patel347> is it me or is woolies posture bar really small?
[2:43:50] <Johannen> Never considered Moon Presence to be "True Final Boss" more like a bonus encounter then anything
[2:43:56] <Indigo_Automaton> @An_Armed_Bear Honestly the fight with the Moon Presence is really lackluster
[2:43:59] <+patel347> I thought it was much bigger at this stage
[2:44:00] <+SouLucha> @slppanther29 And there used to be a glitch to get a 5th healthbar.
[2:44:00] <+Dova573> Makes me wish Moonpresense was first then after you get a 3 phase yarhnam fight
[2:44:01] <MeMillionthDollar> HESITATION
[2:44:07] <pixelkenj> DOUBLE
[2:44:16] <ullyzeez> cant do reads man gotta react to it
[2:44:17] <slppanther29> Isshin is literally the grandpa who stands up from his wheelchair doodLUL
[2:44:21] <The_Grand_J> ooo stormking
[2:44:22] <+krispen_wa> Moon Presence was balanced around you killing Gehrman first
[2:44:29] <+krispen_wa> which is why its so underwhelming
[2:44:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Got him with the double jumanji
[2:44:36] <matteasyplays> Call an ambulance but not for me. - Ishiin
[2:44:36] <+Dova573> I mean gehrman
[2:44:38] <Johannen> Will Woolie learn to deflect finaly on the Last Boss of the game?
[2:44:39] <Ashenik1> I love MachineGun Saint :3
[2:44:46] <pixelkenj> tfw you gotta backdash across half an entire field to feel safe
[2:44:46] <jorniev> I think this dude is the best thing about sekiro
[2:44:47] <lyzejag> Holy shit Woolie did almost zero damage to him
[2:44:47] <+Grayhammatter> so itchy
[2:44:53] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:44:59] <An_Armed_Bear> This is a posture fight
[2:45:01] <zocano> You basically only get him through posture
[2:45:02] <+Dova573> Tbf anything will feel underwhelming after Gerhnam
[2:45:08] <Ashenik1> Sekiro is itchy for Isshin
[2:45:09] <+AdlerDynamic> he's pretty quick for an old timer
[2:45:10] <An_Armed_Bear> No laming it out
[2:45:14] <%ChoculaUltra> hes a quick old man, that Isshin I'll tell ya h'what
[2:45:18] <+Grayhammatter> nice hit
[2:45:18] <+kieranmusic> Think Blood Starved Beast almost. Backwards dodge is death. Side dodges are your friend.
[2:45:19] <CoffeeSlice> nice
[2:45:20] <jorniev> parry parry parry
[2:45:23] <jamox1> The crazy thing is Woolie initial assault on him when he first saw him got Isshin to half
[2:45:25] <pixelkenj> sweeeeep
[2:45:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:45:26] <StarlessAH> This dude right here is essentially the only thing in Sekiro that matters. The lore of the game all goes back to him
[2:45:27] <marumiyan1> SWEE{ED
[2:45:27] <Raldavar> Shinobi in an orange suit fighting a legendary undead summon. Where have I seen this? lobosGame

[2:45:33] <moeartifact> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[2:45:34] <slppanther29> Homing move doodLUL
[2:45:35] <Indigo_Automaton> Imagine if Isshin had a beast form
[2:45:35] <Ashenik1> no its no LUL
[2:45:36] <MeMillionthDollar> Hesitation is defeat
[2:45:38] <+SouLucha> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[2:45:38] <%SainEdge> nope LUL
[2:45:39] <$horse_oil> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[2:45:40] <CoffeeSlice> what
[2:45:40] <andre11dr> DS3 had a relatively straight forward fight, which is probably why it's my favorite of the final bosses
[2:45:40] <RaiNiMayonnaise> again you hesitat
[2:45:42] <jorniev> FEAR IS THE MIND KILLER
[2:45:42] <spawnzie> pretty much LUL
[2:45:44] <An_Armed_Bear> You can block the wind slashes right
[2:45:44] <DXLelouch24> Game bout to force you ass to learn deflect Woolie! This boss is your final exam and you gonna learn.
[2:45:47] <%AyotoCorp> @Indigo_Automaton Isshin IS the beast form
[2:45:50] <Spearweaver> HESITATION = DEFEAT
[2:45:52] <moeartifact> The Sword Saint has no blindspots YOU FOOL
[2:45:58] <+FlubbedPig> A lot of his wind-ups transition into different moves depending on position.

[2:46:01] <Coystick> Isshin, Gehrman, Gwyn, Fromsoft grandpas fuck
[2:46:02] <ullyzeez> you can parry it woolz
[2:46:03] <marumiyan1> hey he didn't get spoiled for once!
[2:46:03] <lyzejag> He's just here to refill your Res lol
[2:46:12] <VJdarkworld> ASHINA WILL RISE AGAIN TheIlluminati
[2:46:14] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> Credit to Gen, he knew when to call for backup.
[2:46:15] <srv4254> remember when he wore a funny mask and killed rats?
[2:46:18] <theyseemerowling> woolieU
[2:46:18] <spawnzie> @Coystick and Gael too
[2:46:20] <primaryfire> when you think about it, it kinda is multiple phases of genichiro
[2:46:20] <RWLJr98> Who da hell is Isshin? Why is he important
[2:46:22] <matteasyplays> Geni a trash mob on this one
[2:46:23] <An_Armed_Bear> Feels like the point
[2:46:24] <CoffeeSlice> genichiero, way of jobber
[2:46:25] <+krispen_wa> Is Isshin the only "LEGENDARY FIGURE" you fight in their prime?
[2:46:27] <pixelkenj> savage
[2:46:28] <%hax_metatron> I wouldn’t say it’s lame — Isshin is just more chad
[2:46:30] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Virgil tagged in Sparda
[2:46:32] <jorniev> OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:46:33] <pennykettle_> Ishin's lines are cooler in English
[2:46:34] <Indigo_Automaton> Genichiro is a little bitch who has to get his grandpa to fight his battles for him
[2:46:36] <+Dova573> the first phase is a genichiro speedrun
[2:46:41] <+OblivionSword1> Genichiro becomes a jobber at the end
[2:46:41] <$horse_oil> genichiro turning into maximum jobber mode fucking rules
[2:46:42] <CoffeeSlice> oof
[2:46:44] <Johannen> Botch
[2:46:45] <Coystick> "I will NOT pay taxes!"
[2:46:46] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:46:48] <Ashenik1> with Woolie I am learing new animations
[2:46:50] <lioxor> the first time i fougth isshin i killed him easy after the hatred demon, then i fougth him again and he was considerably harder
[2:46:51] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:46:51] <%SainEdge> Woolie did it for the animation Kappa
[2:46:52] <joefromsingapore> Is Kuro the bad guy here
[2:46:52] <SoulKarl> is he not parrying? just blocking?
[2:46:54] <%Javaa01> Genichiro is literally just a pre-fight sleep check
[2:46:59] <spawnzie> Geni exists to be bullied
[2:46:59] <+patel347> THATS EVERY BOSS WOOLIE
[2:47:05] <stepanmosh> he parries
[2:47:05] <Basic_Birch_> Hard botch
[2:47:07] <pixelkenj> Isshin is so chad they didnt want to start a coup against him even when he was old- only when he was super old
[2:47:07] <samuelfisk> Genichiro is that archer outside the Lady Butterfly’s boss room.
[2:47:08] <+SouLucha> Genichiro is the warm-up fight.
[2:47:12] <primaryfire> he dies in like 15 seconds once you get in the groove
[2:47:17] <andre11dr> Gwyn is sadly enough is like the easiest of the final bosses and Soul of Cinder is just him but better, being Gwyn sucks
[2:47:22] <+SouLucha> Genichiro is a button check!
[2:47:23] <Coystick> Genichiro preps the bull
[2:47:24] <CoffeeSlice> Genichiro here is like that one archer before lady butterfly
[2:47:24] <+Pinkiefan> From what I have seen you aren’t ready to beat Isshin until you can repeatedly beat Genichiro without getting hit.
[2:47:27] <marumiyan1> wat
[2:47:28] <%Afterman_> genichiro is honestly the game's wall, if you can beat him you can beat the entire game. I was stuck on Genichro's fight at the top of the tower for like.. 2 weeks, and I ended up beating the last boss within an hour or two
[2:47:32] <%Takreth> LUL
[2:47:34] <An_Armed_Bear> 360 degrees and walk away
[2:47:38] <Johannen> Woolie is going for those 360 noscopes
[2:47:40] <%ChoculaUltra> run away, but not to far away LUL
[2:47:47] <+kieranmusic> While I agree I also like the Genichiro is there almost to show how much you’ve gotten better and grown.
[2:47:53] <CoffeeSlice> oh
[2:48:00] <brunoberserk> the idea is : genichiro become powerless againt you , so he summons someone waaaaay stronger
[2:48:01] <srv4254> 3sisty and walk away
[2:48:03] <Ashenik1> but Gwyn thematically and atmospherically is great as a final boss
[2:48:08] <stepanmosh> dunno if anyone said this, but you can cancel Genichiro's mortal draw with your own
[2:48:16] <An_Armed_Bear> This would probably be easier if Woolie hadn't taken a long break, the game kind of expects you to remember this fight from earlier
[2:48:19] <Johannen> Goddamn Gwyn is amazing
[2:48:23] <%ChoculaUltra> word, bringing Genichiro in like this gives major Megaman X vibes when they threw Vile in at the last stage before the boss rush. He stomped you before, now you stomp him.
[2:48:30] <+krispen_wa> Nah but what about Nashandra though, she's a great-no
[2:48:34] <andre11dr> Again Soul of Cinder is Gwyn but better
[2:48:39] <pixelkenj> True
[2:48:41] <slppanther29> Has Woolie learned how to properly deflect?
[2:48:41] <+SouLucha> woolieONEGUY
[2:48:44] <Coystick> Woolie doin work
[2:48:46] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months!
[2:48:46] <JDebss> You've been doing great Woolie!
[2:48:47] <pennykettle_> DS3 has the worst final boss of any souls game, I treat Gael as the final boss
[2:48:52] <jorniev> yeah one guy
[2:48:53] <Cral_Senpai> I got hard stuck on this boss.
[2:48:57] <CoffeeSlice> GET BONKED GENICHIRO
[2:49:00] <primaryfire> @pennykettle_ chill one guy
[2:49:04] <An_Armed_Bear> Not trying to call him out
[2:49:04] <+krispen_wa> how is DS3's boss worse than nashandra
[2:49:05] <Basic_Birch_> @Afterman_ For me there were multiple walls. Genichiro was one but sword saint was definitely another
[2:49:06] <mobile_suit> @pennykettle_ I think Nash is worse than soul of cinder tbh
[2:49:07] <GilliamYaeger> He means you'd still be familiar with Genichiro's moveset
[2:49:10] <Johannen> @pennykettle_ You dont like the Soul of CInder?
[2:49:10] <Spearweaver> soul of cinder is great though
[2:49:17] <stepanmosh> @pennykettle_ aw soul of cinder was alright and emotional
[2:49:22] <An_Armed_Bear> More thinking about the design of the game I guess
[2:49:22] <lyzejag> Plin plan plon is pretty great
[2:49:26] <+FrostedZaibatsu> In the words of Lil V "Shut the fuck up"
[2:49:29] <andre11dr> @pennykettle_ Worst than Nashandra ,you smoking rocks?
[2:49:31] <Ashenik1> souls of cinder is fun but just it
[2:49:32] <samazam94> woolie pls just ignore chat from this point forward
[2:49:33] <JDebss> You got this dude
[2:49:36] <pixelkenj> SeemsGood
[2:49:37] <Flare3500> Face Yourself then Don't Hesitate
[2:49:38] <+krispen_wa> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[2:49:38] <+kieranmusic> Cinder isn’t bad but just kinda disappointing with what you think it’ll be
[2:49:40] <Ashenik1> we know better Woolie Kppa
[2:49:43] <Ashenik1> Kappa
[2:49:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:49:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Just learn the fight, 4head Kappa
[2:49:47] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Learning is the fight
[2:49:49] <VJdarkworld> Hesitation is Defeat PowerUpR
[2:49:50] <primaryfire> it's a tough fight for sure
[2:49:51] <superchunk121> U got this
[2:49:51] <%BinaryFireball> improv is hesitation
[2:49:53] <%Afterman_> i mean woolie aint wrong
[2:49:56] <Spearweaver> Aldia is the most ass final boss
[2:49:56] <pixelkenj> dont bullie wollie
[2:49:56] <Johannen> Hesitation is The Feet
[2:49:59] <jamox1> Woolie needs to fight the man in his mind so he can kill him irl!!!
[2:50:01] <Ashenik1> we know but
[2:50:07] <%ZweihanderSteve> GANBATTE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[2:50:09] <ullyzeez> what a maniac talking to himself???
[2:50:10] <Ashenik1> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[2:50:10] <%Afterman_> download complete
[2:50:10] <+krispen_wa> aldia is thematically cool but mechanically shit
[2:50:13] <RWLJr98> Sounds frustrating!
[2:50:16] <%SirGO0SE> dude just stick him with the pointy end 4head
[2:50:16] <+b_aleph> So how many tournaments have you won? LUL JUST KIDDING
[2:50:17] <stepanmosh> BONK....BONK
[2:50:18] <pennykettle_> I couldn't care less about Soul of Cinder because he's a nobody. Nashandra is a lame fight but there's at least a motivation to kill her. Soul of Cinder fight is you fighting a bad metaphor with a recycled moveset 🎤 drop
[2:50:20] <slppanther29> Take your time with this fight Woolie
[2:50:21] <+Grayhammatter> hit em with the double
[2:50:25] <andre11dr> Cinder is almost if not better than Gheraman to me
[2:50:28] <SoulKarl> woolie just ichi'd his monji
[2:50:31] <samuelfisk> I hate Aldia’s invincibility phases
[2:50:34] <+krispen_wa> you dropped your mic into a pile of shit
[2:50:38] <Johannen> Soul of CInder isa nobody? What are you on?
[2:50:41] <pixelkenj> thirsty wolf
[2:50:44] <Flare3500> You honestly shouldn'
[2:50:45] <primaryfire> it's good that you're sharing your thoughts on how to approach this
[2:50:46] <+NocturnePsycho> trust woolie's process
[2:50:51] <+SouLucha> BOP BOP LUL
[2:50:53] <Ashenik1> Soul of Cinder is cute
[2:50:54] <Basic_Birch_> @WoolieVersus Isshin wouldn't be much easier but had you played this part nearer to the original Genichiro fight this Genichiro would likely be easier
[2:51:03] <+kieranmusic> To be fair. This is arguably the toughest Souls-Borne-Sekiro fight.
[2:51:04] <%Afterman_> i would definitely recommend woolie abuse the fuck out of that two hitter. its strong af
[2:51:05] <RaiNiMayonnaise> how about 10 drinks
[2:51:09] <JDebss> Take to heart the good comments as well as the bad
[2:51:09] <+MugenSandan> Can we get "Hesitation is Defeat" in big letters on screen like we had "No he hasn't gotten to phase 2" for Owl
[2:51:10] <pennykettle_> Soul of Cinder is never talked about anywhere, he's not a character. I understand the "culmination of everyone who relit the first flame" thing
[2:51:13] <pixelkenj> how about that pontiff guy tho
[2:51:13] <+cubbywolf> you are only allowed 1 drink during genichiro fight and 1 after
[2:51:17] <Ashenik1> Remember Genichirio is just a warm up Kappa
[2:51:21] <+krispen_wa> Soul of Cinder would be cooler if he didn't have the Gwyn phase
[2:51:22] <NumbF4ke> Noice
[2:51:25] <Johannen> @MugenSandan Only if we can modify it to Hesitation is The Feet
[2:51:30] <primaryfire> phase 2 is gonna be fun lmao
[2:51:30] <+patel347> you can tell which is which by previous stance
[2:51:30] <VJdarkworld> SEKIROYOO
[2:51:31] <An_Armed_Bear> Pontiff should have been the final boss of 3
[2:51:32] <andre11dr> @But Nashandra is? LUL
[2:51:33] <jamox1> YEAH YEAH GET THAT OLD MAN
[2:51:35] <MeMillionthDollar> I know Woolie Better than Woolie does okay?
[2:51:40] <+SouLucha> HESI-- Oh?
[2:51:44] <ullyzeez> 2nd phase isshin is the hardesr
[2:51:44] <+cubbywolf> EAT THE OLD
[2:51:46] <+krispen_wa> Pontiff should have been the penultimate boss
[2:51:47] <pennykettle_> @An_Armed_Bear I think he was planned to be, DS3 had rewrites
[2:51:55] <An_Armed_Bear> Ok yeah, penultimate would work
[2:52:07] <Blackleafx> put this old man down like that yakuza doctor was gonna do
[2:52:09] <+Pinkiefan> Phase two Isshin is gonna be a surprise, haha.
[2:52:13] <slppanther29> Just take your time, learn his moves and weaknesses and DONT HESITATE. Also have fun with this fight doodSmug
[2:52:13] <Afrosamasenpai> Yeah! Stomp on the old man!
[2:52:16] <+Grayhammatter> oh, weird interaction there
[2:52:17] <VJdarkworld> GOOMBA STOMPS KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:52:17] <zocano> Pontiff was originally the final boss so
[2:52:21] <Ashenik1> Nameless should be the final boss kappa
[2:52:25] <+livi242> is every Fromsoft final boss about putting a boomer in their place?
[2:52:26] <+AdlerDynamic> dude has staggers
[2:52:26] <mobile_suit> hesitation is defeat
[2:52:28] <primaryfire> he never hesitates, he delays
[2:52:31] <MeMillionthDollar> Scientific Boss Fight
[2:52:32] <+cubbywolf> F
[2:52:33] <%Javaa01> HE doesn't hesistate
[2:52:33] <thetruenicster> But Woolie, Hesitation Is Defeat
[2:52:34] <An_Armed_Bear> "Kill old men to sad music"
[2:52:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Just a series of right answers
[2:52:36] <Johannen> Hesitation is The Feet
[2:52:37] <%Javaa01> YOU hesitate
[2:52:38] <MeMillionthDollar> From Software KNOWS
[2:52:39] <jamox1> I grin every time Woolie gets off a sick combo
[2:52:39] <JDebss> DAt gap Kreygasm
[2:52:40] <RaiNiMayonnaise> ishin doesnt hesitate, you do
[2:52:43] <%Afterman_> no hesitation, purposeful delay
[2:52:45] <lyzejag> I fought this guy so much i forgot how tough he is the first time damn
[2:52:48] <+SouLucha> He makes you hesitate.
[2:52:49] <andre11dr> Cinder is way better than Pontiff so im glad it changed
[2:52:51] <+patel347> the only mistake woolie is making tbh is being too passive
[2:52:52] <The_Grand_J> the delays remind me of Nameless King
[2:52:52] <Blackleafx> RUN AWAY
[2:52:59] <+krispen_wa> The furtive pygmy was techically the final boss through Gael, which was cool
[2:53:02] <RWLJr98> This is the run! Kappa
[2:53:02] <pennykettle_> If DS3 wanted fanservice final boss, they should have just gone all out and made you fight Solaire, fuck it. Go all out
[2:53:03] <+patel347> this game is about unrelenting assault
[2:53:04] <Ashenik1> Just run
[2:53:07] <Spearweaver> walking slow
[2:53:13] <Raldavar> The only danger Nashandra and Aldia presents is making the player fall asleep
[2:53:14] <Blackleafx> joestar technique
[2:53:14] <jamox1> The ultimate joe star technique
[2:53:17] <Ashenik1> fuck this boss just run away
[2:53:17] <mobile_suit> if you let his bar drop the fight will take forever and eat all your heals, hence hesitation is defeat
[2:53:21] <mobile_suit> the ultimate posture fight
[2:53:26] <Johannen> Who is Pontiff anyway? He is nobody to the player compared to Souls of Cinder
[2:53:27] <+AdlerDynamic> isshin blockstrings are like a fighting game. he feints, he staggers, and he punishes hard
[2:53:28] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Ill sub if Woolie runs off the edge
[2:53:28] <Ashenik1> Hesitation is Defeat
[2:53:31] <sporeian94> DON'T JUMP
[2:53:34] <MeMillionthDollar> Ishhin Graceful AF
[2:53:42] <%dreadedcthulhu> don't get frame trappee
[2:53:45] <SenpaiMD> woolie watch the glint of his sword!!!
[2:53:47] <stepanmosh> sometimes it's a stab
[2:53:50] <stepanmosh> not always a sweep
[2:53:51] <zocano> Pontiff wasn’t Pontiff when he was the original final boss anyway
[2:53:52] <Sternieliscious> Rush up on the sheath, he'll do a different attack.
[2:53:53] <SenpaiMD> THE GLINT WOOLIE
[2:53:56] <VJdarkworld> @pennykettle_ solaires already the worm tho Kappa
[2:53:57] <An_Armed_Bear> @Johannen In the context of 3's story he's like the guy behind everything. In the context of the whole series yeah he's not as important
[2:53:57] <+FlubbedPig> After sheathe his next move is based on position.
[2:53:58] <$horse_oil> isshin is my favorite souls boss he's so good
[2:54:01] <+krispen_wa> pontiff is responsible for like half the reason you have to lug everyone to their thrones
[2:54:04] <lyzejag> When he sheath he has multiple moves he can do, so yeah you need to wait
[2:54:10] <RaiNiMayonnaise> isshin with the option select
[2:54:11] <slppanther29> I really want to give tips for this fight but i don't want to backseat him with this fight
[2:54:11] <pennykettle_> Pontiff in the CURRENT version of the game is a bit of a nobody. In the original plot he was way more important
[2:54:13] <andre11dr> Like story even matter in Souls games Kappa
[2:54:15] <StarlessAH> Soul of Cinder should've been Oscar of Astora, think about it
[2:54:24] <SenpaiMD> sekiro is secretly a punch-out!!! sequel
[2:54:26] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I wonder if Woolie should try hesitating
[2:54:29] <Spearweaver> Pontiff, aka local man ruins everything
[2:54:32] <pennykettle_> @VJdarkworld mrmSuffer
[2:54:32] <Johannen> Hesitation is The Feet
[2:54:33] <+krispen_wa> soul of cinder should have just been patches
[2:54:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Remember Mr Tutorial that only knew that move LUL
[2:54:38] <Ashenik1> Dark Souls should have never been a series
[2:54:45] <pennykettle_> @Ashenik1 TRUE AND BASED
[2:54:51] <mobile_suit> I think ichimonji is really not great for bosses despite being the best for fighting mooks
[2:54:52] <Robot_Nixon_> ???
[2:54:52] <MrMegaJackpots> pontiff is weird cu playing through the game I kept thinking he'd be the big bad but he ends up being some mid game mook
[2:54:54] <MeMillionthDollar> LUL
[2:54:54] <+NocturnePsycho> damn lmao
[2:54:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that loop tho
[2:54:58] <+FlubbedPig> Oh shit... my style of play in Sekiro is TOTALLY just Punch Out. Shit.
[2:54:58] <$horse_oil> jobbed
[2:55:00] <pennykettle_> Fromsoft does 1 off IP's, don't do sequels
[2:55:00] <stepanmosh> wow it's hot takes the chat
[2:55:06] <An_Armed_Bear> Pontiff doesn't even get a dang cutscene
[2:55:07] <leith_aziz> I JUST SHOWED UP
[2:55:08] <andre11dr> @ashenik1 Agreed, should've made DeS 2 instead
[2:55:14] <Robot_Nixon_> these takes are just bait at this point
[2:55:16] <+krispen_wa> flames hotter than the First Flame
[2:55:17] <CoffeeSlice> NCIE
[2:55:18] <Ashenik1> @andre11dr Kappa
[2:55:20] <+TopTieramisu> people clamoring for bloodborne 2 learned nothing from ds2 and 3
[2:55:21] <%KiwamiKiryu> That was greedy but cool
[2:55:23] <leith_aziz> Woolie reached the boss, huh
[2:55:34] <+krispen_wa> OOOOOH ELDEN SHITPOST
[2:55:37] <lotharrio> There's a move you get from one of the carp merchants that does solid chip damage. I relied on it a lot for later bosses.
[2:55:38] <pennykettle_> @TopTieramisu I am surrounded by my people, god yes
[2:55:38] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Genichiro getting 2-0
[2:55:40] <Basic_Birch_> Just use puppeteer ninjutsu on genichiro Kappa
[2:55:40] <RWLJr98> This is what weebs think they look like
[2:55:48] <slppanther29> OOOOH Elden Ring Kreygasm
[2:55:51] <An_Armed_Bear> I forgot just how much health this dude has
[2:55:54] <jamox1> Make the old man fight himself
[2:55:57] <$horse_oil> isshin doesn't leave you a lot of space to do health damage
[2:56:01] <Ashenik1> peopl still believe in Elden Ring LUL
[2:56:05] <matteasyplays> SourPls
[2:56:12] <ullyzeez> L1 reduces posture damage woolz
[2:56:14] <$horse_oil> you have to learn him honestly, which makes him really hard
[2:56:18] <%KiwamiKiryu> Is this the final boss?
[2:56:23] <Blackleafx> yes
[2:56:25] <alaskanbullwurm> yes
[2:56:26] <The_Grand_J> Pontif just sees all these lords coming back from the dead and tries to do a power play to be important when the Deep takes over
[2:56:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @KiwamiKiryu ye
[2:56:27] <+FlubbedPig> Shoulder check always leads into sweep
[2:56:28] <+TopTieramisu> yes
[2:56:29] <leith_aziz> Gotta say, the stages look beautiful
[2:56:38] <mobile_suit> killing isshin with health damage sounds so miserable
[2:56:41] <+krispen_wa> i wish they actually ELABORATED on the deep
[2:56:47] <pennykettle_> The only sequel Bloodborne should ever get is a whole new IP and genre, but when you beat one of the late game bosses, an Insight counter is added to your HUD and never elaborated on
[2:56:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[2:56:51] <%KiwamiKiryu> Got it yeah, that arena seems very last boss
[2:56:52] <An_Armed_Bear> Once he downloads that move I think he's got this
[2:56:52] <+SoySocks> with the slash you can't mikiri, i think he twists his torso more in prep
[2:56:57] <+TopTieramisu> i love bushido gehrman
[2:57:01] <sporeian94> Gotta be agressive woolie
[2:57:01] <slppanther29> Yep, you can beat him by lowing his health, but beating him through posture is better
[2:57:02] <$horse_oil> there are tells for every one of his moves, but they're subtle, it kind of rules, its very well designed
[2:57:05] <Blackleafx> also god i forgot how tiny sekiro man is, isshin towers over him
[2:57:06] <Peyote_> Honestly a good strat is to fight isshin close to the bridge so he’s not obscured by the flowers
[2:57:11] <ullyzeez> minh you brought your pajamas??
[2:57:16] <Johannen> @krispen_wa I just always took it as dark matter/heat death of the universe concept
[2:57:16] <Sternieliscious> Sheath at distance is always a double slash. Sheath at short is a stab to Mikiri.
[2:57:17] <slppanther29> Nice
[2:57:21] <%Takreth> 5' 11" vs 6' right here
[2:57:27] <Blackleafx> gotta follow up on it
[2:57:29] <+krispen_wa> Manlet wold
[2:57:29] <+Freakin_Wolfy> hahahahahahaha
[2:57:31] <+krispen_wa> wolf
[2:57:31] <Parapattern> Posture damage is the way to go here
[2:57:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you interrupt his ashina cross it is always a sweep
[2:57:42] <NumbF4ke> Isn't pontiff from Ariandels painting?
[2:57:45] <RWLJr98> Woolie looking for elaborate combos when I’m thinking this is the one time he should be button mashing LUL
[2:57:46] <matteasyplays> oh damn
[2:57:48] <$horse_oil> you can make this first phase go really fast, but you have to play really well
[2:57:48] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I think I just realized something. Is Mikiri counters over the opponents head and unblockable are above your head????
[2:57:49] <Blackleafx> That hitbox was whack
[2:57:51] <mobile_suit> it's less never 3 and more hit until you get deflected
[2:57:58] <MeMillionthDollar> Lol look at that health bar
[2:58:00] <+krispen_wa> Yeah pontiff was from ariandel
[2:58:03] <brunoberserk> Woolie WILL figure it out
[2:58:12] <+krispen_wa> and he saw the rot of ariandel and realized outside was just as bad
[2:58:13] <MeMillionthDollar> I BELIEVE in Woolie
[2:58:15] <Johannen> @RWLJr98 He always ovethinoing stuff and ignoring the basics
[2:58:16] <%Javaa01> Yeah you're never gonna beat this boss by health, all you can do is play the stamina game better then he does and wear him out
[2:58:20] <jamox1> Woolie WILL combo him to death
[2:58:21] <lyzejag> You can't not learn the rythm of this fight, he regen posture like a motherfucker
[2:58:21] <+krispen_wa> which is why he fucks up everything
[2:58:21] <andre11dr> But who cares about Souls anyway, give me more Armoured Core! DO IT MIYAZAKI!
[2:58:24] <slppanther29> He's got this chat. Only give tips WHEN ASKED
[2:58:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gettin there
[2:58:26] <mobile_suit> He got owl father he'll definitely get this
[2:58:32] <$horse_oil> hell yeah
[2:58:34] <+Grayhammatter> nice parry
[2:58:34] <Ashenik1> Hesitation is Defeat
[2:58:36] <+FlubbedPig> Yeeeaaah, deflect that Ashina Cross
[2:58:37] <Idon__> love how he does all the sword school moves you've learnt
[2:58:38] <+RahuHordika> Hesitation is defeat
[2:58:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CLOSE
[2:58:41] <mobile_suit> hella close
[2:58:41] <matteasyplays> ohhhh
[2:58:42] <Johannen> Hesitation is The Feet
[2:58:42] <+krispen_wa> DEAD
[2:58:43] <MeMillionthDollar> thats a 360
[2:58:44] <+TopTieramisu> Hesitation is defeat
[2:58:49] <mobile_suit> Hesitation is defeat
[2:58:50] <$TheFabledAble> its a parry
[2:58:50] <$horse_oil> owl dad is at least as hard as this boss so woolie has this
[2:58:50] <Ashenik1> you can parry this attack
[2:58:51] <+b_aleph> nowhere
[2:58:51] <slppanther29> Good run Good run
[2:58:51] <Flare3500> Safety is deflecting that attack don't hesitate
[2:58:55] <GilliamYaeger> So close to phase 2...
[2:58:56] <jamox1> Good run good run
[2:58:57] <+cubbywolf> PARRY
[2:58:57] <RaiNiMayonnaise> No he has not reached phase 2 ishin
[2:58:58] <+krispen_wa> just dodge roll it Kappa
[2:58:59] <PanicSwytch> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:58:59] <Blackleafx> @Idon__ dude invented em
[2:59:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FAR AWAY
[2:59:02] <Karhax> parry
[2:59:03] <Reckless_Rob> I never understood that attack
[2:59:03] <MeMillionthDollar> Just dont hesitate
[2:59:09] <+cubbywolf> PARRYYYYYY
[2:59:12] <Flare3500> You can deflect that attack Woolie
[2:59:13] <samuelfisk> I think that’s straight up run away
[2:59:14] <+SouLucha> @andre11dr New people will make Armored Core, From has long left that series now...
[2:59:15] <$TheFabledAble> it doesnt have a red kanji alert which means you can pary it
[2:59:16] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa YOU CAN DODGE IT?!
[2:59:19] <andre11dr> Man we haven't even seen his glock yet
[2:59:23] <Reckless_Rob> I like how hes orang, like a ninja, like Naruto
[2:59:23] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Forget Souls rules, dodges and jumps are for unblockebls only
[2:59:26] <Blackleafx> shhh
[2:59:27] <%KiwamiKiryu> No summons or anything o. this game right? sorry I've played all souls but no idea about Sekiro
[2:59:29] <%Javaa01> This entire fight is about using the tools and mechanics of THIS game, not the usual Souls logic
[2:59:29] <Timarkot> At least you know to go for posture damage
[2:59:33] <ferbeholds> did he already defeat the demon ?
[2:59:35] <Idon__> Like his Ashina cross is actually straight up a + instead of an x
[2:59:36] <jamox1> Yo you can parry the air? That’s rad
[2:59:37] <VJdarkworld> this aint yo mama's soulz
[2:59:37] <slppanther29> Fine one tip for that attack, jump on his head
[2:59:39] <Blackleafx> @KiwamiKiryu Nope, not really
[2:59:40] <matteasyplays> BONK BONK
[2:59:42] <lyzejag> Jump needs position, parry and also run are possible
[2:59:43] <lioxor> idk i always jump that attack
[2:59:54] <JetpackMcQuack> When in doubt, turn and run
[2:59:57] <pennykettle_> Imagine trying to swordfight a guy IRL and he jumps off your head
[3:00:02] <Ashenik1> oh genichiro you are so adorable
[3:00:03] <Blackleafx> woolie's getting much better at genichiro
[3:00:07] <$horse_oil> my favorite thing about this fight is you go total sicko mode after a while and genichiro becomes a total chump
[3:00:09] <matteasyplays> Genny
[3:00:10] <Spearweaver> to be fair, orange is actually a pretty good colour for stealth. See also: tigers
[3:00:14] <An_Armed_Bear> Yeah now he's got it
[3:00:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[3:00:22] <+AdlerDynamic> only one sip
[3:00:23] <Reckless_Rob> Stabby stab
[3:00:29] <Blackleafx> how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
[3:00:30] <jamox1> Smooth smooth!!!
[3:00:33] <matteasyplays> FACE ME SEKIRO
[3:00:34] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Genichiro status: Jobbed
[3:00:36] <Johannen> Hesitation is The Feet
[3:00:38] <Ashenik1> Hesitation is Defeat
[3:00:39] <Coystick> Cum Sekiro
[3:00:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is probably hard when it's been two years since you fought genichiro
[3:00:41] <+Grayhammatter> hesistation is defeat
[3:00:46] <+yukichocomilk> hesitation is the feat
[3:00:53] <Blackleafx> nailed it
[3:00:53] <Basic_Birch_> Hesitation is the feet
[3:00:54] <joefromsingapore> Fighting with one hand
[3:00:55] <VJdarkworld> this fight forced me to learn how posture system worked
[3:01:00] <%KiwamiKiryu> @blackleafx so you have to do it by yourself always? man I honestly always had some help on the final bosses for DS, in 1 I got the sun bro for finishing his quest
[3:01:04] <sporeian94> Woolie is gonna crap at phase 2 when GUN
[3:01:06] <Flare3500> You can deflect that , don't hesitate
[3:01:08] <$horse_oil> sprinting is free
[3:01:08] <Ashenik1> get away or parry
[3:01:09] <+cubbywolf> run or parry it
[3:01:10] <An_Armed_Bear> @fruit_pie_the_magician Yeah just a matter of relearning him though
[3:01:16] <matteasyplays> the punish
[3:01:23] <+Sharmanyx> how long has woolie been playing for
[3:01:23] <$horse_oil> no stamina so you can sprint whenever
[3:01:27] <An_Armed_Bear> He's already got him mostly down
[3:01:28] <BabyNaBackbrace> I got stuck at this boss and couldn't finish
[3:01:30] <jamox1> Damn this old man gets his posture back so quick
[3:01:34] <Ashenik1> and this is the easy phase LUL
[3:01:40] <Blackleafx> @KiwamiKiryu Sekiro was a lot more focused on singleplayer stuff, and the boss fights are more intended as one on one duels with loads of comboing and blocking, so multiplayer probably wouldn't mesh well with it
[3:01:44] <jumpyhugs> Hesitation! No breathing!
[3:01:44] <+TopTieramisu> how far has woolie gotten with isshin?
[3:01:46] <matteasyplays> he was gonna ichimonji there but cancelled
[3:01:47] <+cubbywolf> Isshin does what Isshin do
[3:01:53] <$horse_oil> I actually think the third phase of isshin is the easiest
[3:01:53] <lioxor> i believe in woolie he seems capable of learning ishin
[3:02:04] <GilliamYaeger> @TopTieramisu No further than this
[3:02:07] <$horse_oil> second is the sickest shit
[3:02:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no u
[3:02:14] <Aydarkzero> Tough Old Bastard
[3:02:14] <StarlessAH> Isshin phase 3 is a victory lap, phase 2 is the wall
[3:02:15] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu thanks
[3:02:22] <Spearweaver> hit him with his own shit PogChamp
[3:02:25] <mobile_suit> yeah hes gettin it
[3:02:32] <VJdarkworld> Isshin = Isshin
[3:02:39] <Blackleafx> Hesitatiooon
[3:02:40] <jamox1> Yeah yeah yeah
[3:02:43] <%ThisIsLloyd> mirakuruKill get his undead jerky butt

[3:02:58] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[3:02:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[3:02:59] <lyzejag> YEYE

[3:03:01] <+krispen_wa> PHASE 2
[3:03:01] <+TopTieramisu> let's gooooo

[3:07:56] <+FlubbedPig> Yeah, pause requires you to be in neutral.
[3:08:02] <Flare3500> I'm shocked it even lets you pause
[3:08:03] <Indigo_Automaton> It's a good compromise to the traditional model
[3:08:10] <+bunchaghosts> fromsoft
[3:08:13] <Spearweaver> can't pause in hitstun/blockstun
[3:08:21] <cheesefriend03> Can not pause mid animation

[3:14:38] <Mr_Zero5232> Thanks Twitch, you didn’t tell me the stream was up
[3:14:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Isshin mad
[3:14:46] <+krispen_wa> HESITATED
[3:14:46] <+b_aleph> DIE WOOLIE, DIE
[3:14:47] <jamox1> Your death isnt safe on block
[3:14:56] <RaiNiMayonnaise> woolie is becoming less hesitant
[3:15:13] <Spearweaver> "Just do what wins" - Isshin Ashina
[3:15:19] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus That was patched out a while ago, it was basically only on release
[3:15:21] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[3:15:24] <danknugglit> Stunlock
[3:15:27] <Ashenik1> Nha man just dont hesitate
[3:15:35] <danknugglit> Hesitation is defeat
[3:15:35] <An_Armed_Bear> "Play to win" - Isshin
[3:15:43] <JetpackMcQuack> B-E- aggressive
[3:15:46] <+SouLucha> It used to be you could fight him all in that first phase then gain another health bar to pull out the spear and final phase.
[3:15:53] <jamox1> Genichiro collects funky pops
[3:15:56] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:15:58] <+krispen_wa> isnt "hesitation is defeat" just a roundabout way of saying "GOGOGOGO! BELIEVE YOURSELF!"

[3:17:04] <+krispen_wa> The fucking aftershock on that wind slash is so cool
[3:17:05] <Robot_Nixon_> just step on the dying boy
[3:17:06] <%Juriasu> how many tries are we on chat?
[3:17:07] <Indigo_Automaton> I think that's a very reasonable way to add pausing into a fromsoft game
[3:17:22] <+TopTieramisu> isshin, mario's worst nightmare
[3:17:26] <Coystick> Balls=shaved
[3:17:28] <Ashenik1> How Elden Ring's combat would look like peepoThink
[3:17:29] <JDebss> @Juriasu Stull a quarter of mine
[3:17:31] <jamox1> 5 or 6 tried I think?
[3:17:34] <moeartifact> it is a mikiri
[3:17:35] <%Javaa01> straight stabs are mikiri
[3:17:35] <jamox1> Maybe this is 8
[3:17:39] <+MugenSandan> Honestly Sekiro and this fight in particular is what got me into fighting games more than anything else
[3:17:39] <jamox1> 7*
[3:17:52] <danknugglit> Did woolie beat DoH?
[3:17:54] <%Juriasu> 7 is still early lol
[3:17:55] <The_NorwegianViking> On that giant sweeping attack you can jump on top of him, just have to wait until the last second
[3:17:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:17:58] <+krispen_wa> yes
[3:17:58] <Coystick> I wanna say Isshin took me 25-30 tries
[3:17:59] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[3:18:01] <Ashenik1> Woolie beat DoH
[3:18:04] <The_NorwegianViking> on the second form that is
[3:18:04] <$horse_oil> very nice first phase
[3:18:05] <danknugglit> Pog
[3:18:14] <jamox1> Getting into Fighting Games: Sekiro
[3:18:17] <JDebss> BOILING BLOOD
[3:18:19] <Flare3500> Why do people count tries , it's easier to just check the time
[3:18:20] <%Juriasu> here comes the gun saint
[3:18:31] <jamox1> Isshin True Form
[3:18:35] <lyzejag> Isshin (including geni) took me around 40-45 tries, it was ROUGH
[3:18:36] <Ashenik1> what was genichiro's plan if Ishin kills Sekiro? would Isshin live on ?
[3:18:42] <+krispen_wa> Shin Isshin
[3:18:46] <danknugglit> Final boss: gun
[3:18:47] <CoffeeSlice> oooo
[3:18:48] <The_NorwegianViking> there
[3:18:48] <Coystick> @Flare3500 Around 2 hours I think
[3:18:50] <$horse_oil> you can jump the big spin
[3:18:56] <The_NorwegianViking> you can jump ob him
[3:18:59] <JDebss> dat sip
[3:19:07] <The_Grand_J> get fucking shot
[3:19:10] <Robot_Nixon_> @Ashenik1 what ever geni wished for, so probably
[3:19:16] <OtakuSnake1> @MugenSandan I hear that. I was already really into DBFZ when this came out, and I feel like beating this game made me better at dragon ball.
[3:19:21] <Flare3500> If you're low on health just fight back don't think feel , never hesitate , never backdown 2
[3:19:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He only took me like 5 tries, but the last try took every single healing item I had, and the second half of the last phase was still super clutch with like 1 hp
[3:19:30] <Indigo_Automaton> Yo he Bloodborne parried him
[3:19:32] <moeartifact> never surrender
[3:19:38] <moeartifact> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[3:19:40] <VJdarkworld> ichi mixup
[3:19:49] <+krispen_wa> could isshin's glock defeat Orphan of Kos?
[3:19:50] <Spearweaver> @Ashenik1 yeah, and it's implied that Isshin would have ressurection powers like Wolf, cause of Kuro's blood on the mortal blde
[3:19:59] <linSP> One hand ichi
[3:20:00] <+MugenSandan> Isshin: NO STOP ONLY GO
[3:20:02] <jamox1> Orphan of Glock?
[3:20:05] <RWLJr98> but what if I dont hesitate to surrender
[3:20:15] <danknugglit> Gun god ishin
[3:20:21] <Coystick> Ah Glock, or some say Glock'em
[3:20:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Genichiro is just the jobber before the main event Kappa

[3:21:26] <jamox1> Go Ku
[3:21:31] <Ashenik1> Genichiro is the fake wall before the hidden area
[3:21:33] <+krispen_wa> Genichiro is vegeta fighting any main arc villain
[3:21:39] <Flare3500> You can deflect those ichimonjis
[3:21:54] <CoffeeSlice> YO
[3:21:55] <jamox1> Is Ishhin Broly?

[3:22:53] <andre11dr> Well it did take us 2 years to get here
[3:23:01] <moeartifact> the fact he regularly swings at you one handed is proof of how badass isshin is
[3:23:03] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:23:23] <+krispen_wa> so where was isshin hiding that spear?
[3:23:31] <jamox1> The shadow realm

[3:23:39] <JDebss> It's all learning

[3:23:47] <andre11dr> He seems to pull it out of the ground

[3:23:56] <+krispen_wa> Minh IS Isshin
[3:24:00] <+balkonas1> @krispen_wa he pulls out from the ground
[3:24:03] <%Javaa01> Yeah don't let him just stand around and regen his posture, that is his health bar

[3:26:16] <Nanomachiner> yeah, what should I get for dinner
[3:26:21] <ScreamLord> I don't get why Isshin wants to fight you. You'd think he'd just be pissed that Genichiro resurrected him anyways despite him explicitly stating he did NOT wanting immortality
[3:26:21] <Ashenik1> favourite porn star
[3:26:21] <Ultimatefool> Favorite food Minh

[3:28:45] <Ashenik1> while Woolie is playing, let Minh read Naruto manga out loud
[3:28:48] <samuelfisk> All the lights in One for All need to light into each other
[3:28:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Now we get a build and go
[3:28:52] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[3:29:05] <%Juriasu> worst part about this game in my opinion is that you can only equip one weapon art at a time
[3:29:08] <Flare3500> Check your rune and summoner spells
[3:29:21] <+Grayhammatter> doing the old quad ichi
[3:29:30] <+krispen_wa> sekiro with all weapon arts available at once would be as cool as Nioh
[3:29:31] <CoffeeSlice> yea, take that, rock
[3:29:34] <+krispen_wa> but alas
[3:29:44] <Ashenik1> should woolie use umbrela when fighting isshin second phase?
[3:29:53] <Flare3500> Sekiro is already cooler than Nioh tho , so yeah
[3:29:56] <%Juriasu> unseen aid PogChamp
[3:29:58] <+krispen_wa> PUT THE CLOTHING BACK ON WOOLIE
[3:30:05] <danknugglit> !MOTIVATED
[3:30:05] <@Moobot> 2147 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:30:18] <jamox1> Seeing Woolie set up his strat live is kinda rad
[3:30:31] <%Juriasu> evo18Tilt ed?
[3:30:34] <+krispen_wa> Isshin and Owl Father are cooler than anything in Nioh. but everything else in nioh shits over the rest of sekiro
[3:30:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> evoTilt2
[3:30:42] <Robot_Nixon_> moon2H
[3:30:43] <Ashenik1> lets talk about Naruto while woolie fights the best final boss in any FromSoftware game
[3:30:56] <jamox1> I fought Nioh 2’s final boss yesterday
[3:31:00] <jamox1> Surprising easy
[3:31:03] <%slimmixrp> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[3:31:04] <%komradedog> has woolie beat owl yet?
[3:31:10] <andre11dr> He'll mix it up.,he's kinda like Allant in that sense
[3:31:11] <jamox1> As opposed to the rest of the bosses
[3:31:12] <+krispen_wa> dlc final boss or actual? both are fairly easy
[3:31:19] <Ashenik1> Woolie has beasten every boss and mini-boss
[3:31:20] <jamox1> Final base game
[3:31:23] <jamox1> Haven’t played dlc
[3:31:27] <%Lion_kun> Woolie maybe you should just call it and schedule one more session?
[3:31:51] <%Juriasu> yep yep yep
[3:31:52] <Ashenik1> was Itachi more powerfull than Marada vanila?
[3:31:56] <+krispen_wa> he's harder as a solo boss in picture scrolls
[3:32:00] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL souls notes for animations
[3:32:18] <Robot_Nixon_> @Ashenik1 refer to madara pasta
[3:32:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:32:21] <GilliamYaeger> Imagine fighting Isshin with Nioh 2 Fists
[3:32:21] <+krispen_wa> because he starts in his second-half form instead of using the player's yokai forms for half the fight
[3:32:25] <danknugglit> Nioh is weird when you start shredding bosses in literally 10 seconds
[3:32:34] <jamox1> Ohh I see
[3:32:46] <jamox1> Yeah that second half form wasn’t as scary as I thought
[3:32:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Man i need nioh 2
[3:32:59] <+krispen_wa> Nioh is funny when you set up a stamina drain build, literally preventing enemies from doing anything
[3:33:03] <Ashenik1> casue like Itachii seems more powerful then Obito; is he/
[3:33:04] <jamox1> 3 swords form was the toughest
[3:33:06] <Spearweaver> R1 OP
[3:33:21] <%Juriasu> R1 is the strongest weapon art
[3:33:26] <CosmoSire> Nioh with slow magic is too easy 4Head
[3:33:30] <JohnRadical> Sekiro always seemed like the "hold my beer" response from FromSoft
[3:33:40] <JetpackMcQuack> Genichiro is a speed bump
[3:33:41] <Ashenik1> R1 is the most powerful art all along
[3:33:57] <Guigondi> true dat
[3:34:09] <%Juriasu> doing good
[3:34:12] <andre11dr> Man, can we get a pause with ancient Japan, so many games did it in the last 3 years im honestly kinda tired of it ,and it's why i didn't beat Tsushima
[3:34:13] <+krispen_wa> HESITATED
[3:34:16] <CoffeeSlice> what
[3:34:16] <CosmoSire> Saint of arms!
[3:34:17] <Ashenik1> I am gonna say it, Tobi ( not obito) was pretty fucking cool
[3:34:24] <Flare3500> Wind litearlly passing through sekiros face
[3:34:26] <+krispen_wa> tobi WAS cool
[3:34:29] <JohnRadical> It takes years for martial arts masters to learn the ways of the almighty R1
[3:34:30] <jamox1> Tobi was Rad
[3:34:37] <CoffeeSlice> NOICE
[3:34:38] <matteasyplays> NICE
[3:34:39] <%Juriasu> Isshin is such a chad
[3:34:40] <+Grayhammatter> nice block
[3:34:43] <Flare3500> See you can deflect it
[3:34:44] <Ashenik1> especialy wen Tobi played Madara
[3:34:46] <Guigondi> HAZY TATION IS THE FEET!
[3:34:49] <%Juriasu> YEYEYE
[3:34:50] <MikeSmashLeo> ok woolie i see you
[3:35:01] <jamox1> Tobi just being a scary as fucky phase man was my fav
[3:35:07] <jamox1> Fuck*
[3:35:08] <+krispen_wa> imagine if Tobi was someone far cooler like Madara's brother or something
[3:35:15] <danknugglit> Shit bucket chan best naruto villan
[3:35:19] <+krispen_wa> its just that the moment the mask fell off
[3:35:20] <andre11dr> Tobis motivation is SO DUMB tho
[3:35:24] <matteasyplays> 4 Heals you can still do it
[3:35:35] <jamox1> Good kill woolie!!!
[3:35:43] <Flare3500> You've mikiri it before just line it up
[3:35:44] <%Juriasu> if you're gonna fuck up and take damage, doing it right before a deathblow is the way to go, since you get the pip back
[3:35:46] <Ashenik1> Or Tobi was just someone who was FULLY justified to destroy the world
[3:35:48] <CosmoSire> Fighting old people at the end is running theme of From Soft
[3:35:51] <RWLJr98> Narutos? in my ninja game stream? its more likely than you think
[3:35:51] <matteasyplays> The camera cancel
[3:35:52] <pennykettle_> So why is he called Sword Saint if he uses the spear more
[3:36:06] <$arcielardor> firecracker?
[3:36:07] <The_Grand_J> camera hesitated LUL
[3:36:10] <Ashenik1> like survivor of Hidden Leaf Village war crimes
[3:36:11] <pennykettle_> fighting in a field of flowers is what fromsoft does since BB
[3:36:30] <The_Grand_J> yeah, ds3 did it too
[3:36:31] <matteasyplays> LUL
[3:36:33] <+krispen_wa> Just realized that the Mortal Blade is just Lady Maria's charged unsheathe attack
[3:36:38] <andre11dr> @pennykettle_ Moonlit Wilderness on that shit
[3:36:39] <+krispen_wa> Mortal draw
[3:36:40] <jamox1> Yeah but field of flowers fight is unbelievably rad so
[3:36:41] <Nanomachiner> Camera-no-Jutsu kinda cheapo

[3:40:17] <LaughingCatt> Pat is crazy
[3:40:19] <+Aeoneth> Did you see that there's a new Dopkapon game being developed?
[3:40:20] <Ultimatefool> A bigger coward than Pat????
[3:40:20] <lotharrio> Running is the real victory.
[3:40:21] <vVAstrAVv> pats a human bulldog
[3:40:22] <+ColonelHandzLanza> pat is also like 2 inches tall tho
[3:40:25] <a_mad_dragon_> pat wouldn't be able to catch up on his tiny legs
[3:40:25] <%SirGO0SE> unpatdictable
[3:40:26] <CoffeeSlice> have you played SOMA?
[3:40:26] <+Mr_Pylon> Pat always has a knife on him
[3:40:28] <brunoberserk> NOBODY KNOWS
[3:40:28] <pennykettle_> the new runeterra expansion is lit
[3:40:28] <VJdarkworld> play Elden Ring Kappa
[3:40:29] <ScreamLord> Pat is small, and crazy. He would fuck you up
[3:40:31] <CosmoSire> Even minh is bored of Sekiro?
[3:40:35] <+allups> same minh
[3:40:37] <jamox1> Pat has non comformable mixups
[3:40:39] <gamewarden92> Pat's a biter, you can't fuck with that.
[3:40:43] <+b_aleph> @ScreamLord SAME AS MINH
[3:40:44] <Spearweaver> Pat would fight super dirty
[3:40:55] <JohnRadical> But Pat preserves his life over everything else. He would rather turn into a toilet and run away from you if you tried to fight em
[3:40:55] <andre11dr> Nah man you got that 99lvl grinder tech, Pat got nothing on that
[3:40:57] <jamox1> That’s super fair, online card games be requiring be purchases
[3:41:01] <jamox1> Big*
[3:41:03] <pennykettle_> Why is y'alls go to question "which of you would win in a fight to the death"
[3:41:04] <+allups> its hard to keep up with metas in ruin tera
[3:41:15] <+b_aleph> Pat would trip over and beaten up horribly in a fight
[3:41:18] <Ashenik1> Pat would throw Zangief at Minh
[3:41:27] <jamox1> @pennykettle_ people be trying to build the tier list
[3:41:27] <Flare3500> Alright Victory lap time
[3:41:28] <CosmoSire> Scamming your way to victory is the true from software game experience
[3:41:35] <The_Grand_J> Pat would go for the eyes
[3:41:35] <MeMillionthDollar> BONK
[3:41:38] <+Grayhammatter> if he could actually pick gief up
[3:41:38] <Ashenik1> BONK
[3:41:47] <Spearweaver> all you have to do is bring a syringe and Pat would flee in terror
[3:41:52] <RWLJr98> 4Head
[3:42:00] <danknugglit> Lie steat cheal. Thats my ninja way!
[3:42:04] <+b_aleph> @The_Grand_J they are spherical too, but he would go for the other balls

[3:42:28] <jamox1> Jobichiro
[3:42:33] <CosmoSire> Do you even to press attack if you parry correctly??
[3:42:35] <+AdlerDynamic> apparently ichimonji is an anti-air

[3:43:01] <%Juriasu> oooh that standard parry on the stab

[3:46:00] <matteasyplays> Defeat is hesitation
[3:46:04] <Flare3500> Gotta line it up
[3:46:06] <moeartifact> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[3:46:07] <Nanomachiner> That's what the winged tips of the spear do I guESS
[3:46:07] <CosmoSire> @ScreamLord jumps were shown in leaks
[3:46:09] <Ashenik1> @ScreamLord Glocks... lots of glocks
[3:46:18] <jamox1> Jumping mechanics
[3:46:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Desitation is Hefeat
[3:46:22] <danknugglit> Hesitation is git gud
[3:46:26] <Josef_Stryker> No offense to Woolie, but he really should've worked on mastering deflecting imo
[3:46:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:46:28] <Flare3500> I frames baby
[3:46:45] <+TheotherKristian> sekiro not rolling
[3:46:45] <Coystick> I fucking hate rollspam, ruins Souls
[3:46:45] <andre11dr> Literally lasers that you just roll threw LUL
[3:46:46] <+PlatinumRevol> It varies from souls game to souls game too
[3:46:53] <glass_marcus> Gods VS I-frames
[3:46:53] <RWLJr98> you get i-frames when jumping?
[3:46:56] <+PlatinumRevol> Ds3 rolls are 99% Iframes
[3:46:56] <%baronblank> the jump's not really a roll though
[3:47:00] <+MacDatAss> i-frames? in my sekiro?
[3:47:03] <Josef_Stryker> There's barely any i-frames for this side dodge
[3:47:06] <%baronblank> it has a very small number of i-frame
[3:47:14] <ScreamLord> Woolie "It's like in fighting games" Madden
[3:47:15] <jamox1> Bloodborne you’re straight up mist dashing with the old bone
[3:47:15] <Guigondi> @WoolieVersus You are improving well, you got this, keep at it and it's only a matter of tim until you defeat him.
[3:47:16] <JohnRadical> You could survive a nuke if you could use a Dark Souls roll
[3:47:16] <danknugglit> Jump isnt safe
[3:47:20] <primaryfire> after playing tekken for so long it was hard to get used to ground invincibility in other games
[3:47:22] <Coystick> If Elden Ring has rollspam I will weep
[3:47:23] <+PlatinumRevol> Ds2 rolls have Iframes at the beginning, bloodborne is 100% iframe
[3:47:24] <CosmoSire> People used to parry having very tight windows, so they don't even bother most of the time
[3:47:25] <+b_aleph> Unless you're playing Azrael
[3:47:26] <Ashenik1> But Sekiro has fewer I-frames than souls games or is it enemies aniamtions
[3:47:27] <%baronblank> it's also super unsafe though
[3:47:28] <Flare3500> The umbrella is free I frames
[3:47:31] <+b_aleph> So many OTGs..
[3:47:33] <+krispen_wa> Nuke has the anti roll tech due to residual hitbox
[3:47:33] <+MacDatAss> just follow the flow chart
[3:47:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Jobichiro
[3:47:47] <matteasyplays> too early
[3:47:49] <JohnRadical> Nah you just need enough stamina
[3:47:57] <+krispen_wa> Is Genichiro the Obito?
[3:48:04] <andre11dr> @coystick You know it will
[3:48:06] <jamox1> The coolest guy?
[3:48:13] <kazataca> Is the Old Bone in Bloodbornea Wesker teleport
[3:48:19] <fangovafang> LuvOops
[3:48:20] <Ashenik1> nah Genichiro was always the bitch
[3:48:23] <CosmoSire> Tilt
[3:48:26] <Spearweaver> Genichiro is clearly Sasuke
[3:48:32] <Ashenik1> Obito was cool as Tobi
[3:48:41] <andre11dr> And it doesn't than it will have Bloodborne dashes wich are even better then rolling
[3:48:46] <Flare3500> Wonder how's Kuro is doing sleeping on that grass
[3:48:49] <danknugglit> Genichiro is iruka
[3:48:51] <VJdarkworld> Getting Better KomodoHype
[3:48:52] <Ashenik1> Genichiro is 100% Sasuske
[3:49:00] <VJdarkworld> Figuring It Out KomodoHype KomodoHype
[3:49:04] <i_need_context_> watching you run in and double ichi is seriously clutch
[3:49:20] <marumiyan1> he's tired man
[3:49:26] <jamox1> If Genichiro is Sasuke then is Isshin Madara? AND ARE YOU TOBIRAMA?!
[3:49:26] <%Javaa01> no johns
[3:49:31] <MeMillionthDollar> TOENAIL
[3:49:37] <JohnRadical> WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT ME
[3:49:40] <Flare3500> It gives you reaction time
[3:49:41] <CosmoSire> Parry window shrinking on whiffs should have been in the game tutorials
[3:49:42] <+TheotherKristian> Why isn't tjis like dark souls?!?!?
[3:49:46] <RWLJr98> you can't beat the way of tomato
[3:49:49] <Coystick> Something something Hesitation
[3:49:52] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[3:50:00] <Ashenik1> I only hear HESITATION
[3:50:03] <fangovafang> Wats yall favorite prosthetics on this game?I love da loaded axe
[3:50:11] <JohnRadical> Hesitation = Weakness
[3:50:12] <OldManDeckardCain> genichiro is like playing guitar hero on easy LUL
[3:50:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Hesitated the hesitation
[3:50:15] <Coystick> Hesitation Squad wua?
[3:50:19] <+krispen_wa> DON'T HESITATE THE HESITATION
[3:50:23] <CosmoSire> Don't hesitate to hesitate
[3:50:25] <+MacDatAss> stop hesitating
[3:50:26] <+Grayhammatter> hesitation isn't defeat when it's genichiro
[3:50:30] <lotharrio> Hesitation is death... wait, but hesitate that time though.
[3:50:30] <JetpackMcQuack> Hesitate cancels
[3:50:42] <Coystick> Infinite Hesitation Works
[3:50:45] <+robosqueeb> isshin: do as I say not as I do
[3:50:46] <JohnRadical> Stop hesitating your ability to not hesitate
[3:50:49] <RWLJr98> time to throw KomodoHype
[3:50:58] <+krispen_wa> dont hesitate to throw batarangs at bane
[3:51:03] <CoffeeSlice> YEA
[3:51:09] <Ashenik1> Dont Hesitate to Hesitate
[3:51:09] <Flare3500> There you go calm down hesitate a little
[3:51:24] <MeMillionthDollar> You MUST Hesitate
[3:51:30] <+Grayhammatter> unlimited hesitation works
[3:51:35] <kazataca> By the time the ichimon animation is over the enemy recovered 90% of its posture dmg
[3:51:35] <JetpackMcQuack> Every euphemism has an asterisk
[3:51:37] <Flare3500> Hesitate when fighting genichiro but not Isshin
[3:51:39] <+yukichocomilk> hesitation is defeat.. unless
[3:51:42] <danknugglit> Hesitation dies twice
[3:51:45] <VJdarkworld> ichimonke
[3:51:50] <JohnRadical> Hesitate, but then like don't
[3:51:52] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @Coystick
[3:51:53] <+Epic_Fubar> feeling this run
[3:51:54] <CoffeeSlice> that's why Isshin tolds him pitiful grandchild. cuz genichiro forces to hesitate and isshin aint down with that
[3:51:59] <%ChoculaUltra> I love the casualness of Isshin like yeah I just crawled out of my grandson, but you still gonna catch these hands
[3:52:00] <Flare3500> Don't hesitate for Ishin
[3:52:00] <%hax_metatron> Honestly I don’t know what Woolie is talking about. It’s not that you have to hesitate, just read the animation correctly
[3:52:06] <marumiyan1> unclench then clench
[3:52:10] <+Grayhammatter> don't hesitate now

[3:56:07] <%ThisIsLloyd> that pause was so unsafe holy shit it was instant
[3:56:08] <+SouLucha> @WoolieVersus if you can identify them, you can goomba stomp his charged low sweeps.
[3:56:08] <%slimmixrp> woolieF
[3:56:08] <lotharrio> Pausing is hesitation is DEATH

[3:56:09] <Guigondi> THE CONTEMPT!!!
[3:56:09] <Flare3500> Yeah Hesitated on screen literally
[3:56:10] <KingOfTheGeats> punished you for pausing
[3:56:10] <andre11dr> Definitely HESITATION

[3:56:12] <+MugenSandan> no stop ONLY GO

[3:56:13] <binaryanomaly16> That's rough, buddy
[3:56:13] <+Epic_Fubar> fuck man, THAT WAS SICK
[3:56:21] <CosmoSire> Hesitate= Defeat
[3:56:23] <%slimmixrp> Yo but you were in it though
[3:56:24] <matteasyplays> What a run though
[3:56:25] <Flare3500> Eat pellets for genichiro
[3:56:26] <RWLJr98> sucks but im surprised you almost beat it after fighting him for under an hour :)
[3:56:27] <danknugglit> So close
[3:56:29] <+MacDatAss> you can jump off of him when he does a charged up draw slash
[3:56:34] <Coystick> PAUSING is HESITATION
[3:56:39] <%hax_metatron> IF ISSHIN JUMPS HE GONNA CATCH THAT LIGHTNING
[3:56:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Get Fine Snow?
[3:56:42] <PanicSwytch> Use Pellets
[3:56:45] <Flare3500> Pausing is actually hesitation
[3:56:46] <Ashenik1> Isshin honestly took ma around 5 hours
[3:56:55] <%Javaa01> @Flare3500 Or just heal via revive, since you get it back after killing him
[3:57:03] <ChoculaUltra> gimme the RICE
[3:57:04] <+krispen_wa> anyone here doing return to yharnam?
[3:57:08] <matteasyplays> Same fought him for like 5 hours also LMAO
[3:57:13] <+krispen_wa> no idea what build to run
[3:57:16] <JohnRadical> Don't not stop hesitating, maybe, but only some of the time though
[3:57:17] <+krispen_wa> thats interesting
[3:57:17] <Devbob98> She knows you hesitated
[3:57:31] <Flare3500> @Flare3500 Yeah but woolie only has one full red ball , so he can only revive once
[3:57:32] <%hax_metatron> If you do everything right you can beat Isshin in <5 minutes. If you struggle, it can take weeks. That’s why it’s a GOATed boss
[3:57:35] <Ashenik1> shouldnt we retutn to Yharnam during haloween?
[3:57:36] <andre11dr> But hey where reaching phase 3 after just a a hour so it's actually really good
[3:57:42] <kazataca> Im jusr started an arcane lad yesterday
[3:57:47] <VJdarkworld> !MOTIVATED
[3:57:47] <@Moobot> 2152 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:57:48] <+JD0394> @woolieversus you should farm your revives
[3:57:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea he's doing good for the time it's taken
[3:57:56] <T_Sasquatch> @krispen_wa we're not in October
[3:57:58] <Flare3500> You only have one full red ball revives
[3:58:13] <+krispen_wa> yeah idk why the souls community is holding it now
[3:58:15] <Spearweaver> phase 2 is the hard part imo, once you get that down you can win
[3:58:21] <danknugglit> Ishin is arguably the hardest soulsborne boss
[3:58:34] <Devbob98> Woolie’s going die cycling through his inventory
[3:58:36] <Ashenik1> well Orphan fucking sucks
[3:58:39] <pennykettle_> hes not that hard, they just throw FOUR phases at you
[3:58:47] <%ChoculaUltra> well its probably because March 24th was the original BB release date, making the game 6 years old as of yesterday
[3:58:50] <+krispen_wa> orphan aint laurence the first fuck
[3:59:01] <+SouLucha> Isshin is the most fun I've had with a Souls Boss.
[3:59:02] <JohnRadical> In terms of the Dark Souls games specifically; Midir is a bitch
[3:59:04] <danknugglit> You can backstab orphan
[3:59:09] <+Grayhammatter> laurence was rough
[3:59:11] <VJdarkworld> patching bloodborne to be 4k 60fps on PS5 is the hardest souls boss
[3:59:16] <Ashenik1> but I think laurence is a duo with bad frames though
[3:59:16] <Spearweaver> defiled watchdog is still the hardest for me
[3:59:30] <JohnRadical> I mean they did it with Blighttown?
[3:59:32] <+krispen_wa> midir is a bitch at first, but the moment you learn to just stay in front of his head, he just becomes a little bitch
[3:59:34] <danknugglit> 60fps BLOODBORNE WHEN
[3:59:40] <Devbob98> Bodied
[3:59:40] <T_Sasquatch> Sony doesn't care aboutt Bloodborne NotLikeThis
[3:59:42] <andre11dr> Man i haven't played Bloodborne in like 3 years, i kinda need it in my veins
[3:59:48] <RWLJr98> This is the run guys
[3:59:51] <+SouLucha> The fact that they put a Genishiro in the way had me roaring for another shot at Isshin, god I loved every moment with Sword Saint.
[3:59:55] <RWLJr98> this one, mark my words
[4:00:03] <Josef_Stryker> As long as you deflect perfectly u can't get guard broken
[4:00:10] <fangovafang> "die twice"
[4:00:10] <Josef_Stryker> Even if the meter looks like it'll max out
[4:00:10] <RWLJr98> Enable gambling
[4:00:15] <Ashenik1> Glock Saint is honestly their arguably best boss
[4:00:18] <andre11dr> @rwljr98 I say it's not
[4:00:20] <VJdarkworld> botch is defeat NotLikeThis
[4:00:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You guys hear about the Demons Souls movie rumourÉ
[4:00:21] <Flare3500> Hesitated on screen

[4:00:37] <RWLJr98> I HAVE CRAZY TALK
[4:00:39] <Josef_Stryker> So begins the tilt
[4:00:44] <CoffeeSlice> thanks unseen aid
[4:00:46] <Tracazoid> So who's harder Woolie, this or DmD Vergil in DMC3?
[4:00:50] <RWLJr98> This one is NOT THE ONE
[4:00:53] <%Juriasu> 1 coin saved PogChamp
[4:00:53] <Flare3500> Unseen aid should give blowjob or something
[4:00:55] <Coystick> unseen AIIIIIIIIIDS
[4:01:00] <andre11dr> @rwljr98 Ok BUT THIS ONE THO
[4:01:02] <+krispen_wa> DmD Vergil is so fucking aggressive
[4:01:04] <%BinaryFireball> Genchiro, Way of you
[4:01:06] <+krispen_wa> and he heals
[4:01:07] <andre11dr> THIS IS THE ONE
[4:01:12] <andre11dr> WATCH IT
[4:01:13] <%BinaryFireball> get the fuck out of the way
[4:01:14] <Ashenik1> almost killing the final boss and then dying to the easiet bitches around
[4:01:16] <%ChoculaUltra> the ichimonji looks like very stern bonking. but with a sword
[4:01:24] <+SouLucha> Ganichiro, In the Way!
[4:01:25] <CoffeeSlice> what
[4:01:33] <JetpackMcQuack> BOP
[4:01:48] <Devbob98> For every loss, Woolie needs to fight a bane
[4:02:00] <Flare3500> Woolie has no revives , farming up some would probably help
[4:02:03] <T_Sasquatch> I don't understand why genichiro has to be basically a phase of the final boss
[4:02:04] <Ashenik1> Woolie wants the daddy, not this punk genichiro
[4:02:11] <Coystick> week of Bane fights
[4:02:13] <danknugglit> I love ishins VA so badass sounding
[4:02:22] <+krispen_wa> @devbob98 still less banes than in asylum
[4:02:25] <andre11dr> @t_sasquatch Cause his a bitch
[4:02:55] <T_Sasquatch> Also woolie can reach isshin but he bumbles arkham aslyum lmfao LUL
[4:03:15] <Devbob98> Don’t watch gameplay, just watch Woolie’s face.
[4:03:17] <Ashenik1> BONK
[4:03:17] <marumiyan1> beautiful
[4:03:21] <CoffeeSlice> REAL ICHIMONJI
[4:03:27] <andre11dr> Like somehow the first fight with Genichiro seems way harder than this one LUL
[4:03:36] <Flare3500> Face me sekiro as he shoots you in the face
[4:03:41] <%ChoculaUltra> oh damn the promptless mikiri monkaS
[4:03:53] <CoffeeSlice> LETS GOOO
[4:03:54] <Ashenik1> did he take this spear out of his ass ?
[4:03:58] <BUDderzIllA> Oo, mad boss stufF!
[4:03:59] <Coystick> DO IT
[4:04:02] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[4:04:03] <CoffeeSlice> nnOOOO
[4:04:04] <bigshedman> Gun saint?! PogChamp
[4:04:04] <+Grayhammatter> bonked
[4:04:09] <andre11dr> Shit
[4:04:11] <Flare3500> No revive balls
[4:04:11] <marumiyan1> we got time
[4:04:13] <PMda2nd> dutty
[4:04:15] <%ChoculaUltra> Sekiro is my favorite kusoge :)
[4:04:16] <Ashenik1> hesitation what?
[4:04:16] <danknugglit> Mikiri counters look so FUCKING sick
[4:04:17] <MihajloMBlood> Samurai Gunn Saint Ishin
[4:04:17] <andre11dr> I guess i was wrong
[4:04:18] <Devbob98> He went too in
[4:04:19] <CoffeeSlice> this boss is so amazing
[4:04:20] <MeMillionthDollar> Just wait for the lunge
[4:04:21] <RWLJr98> Ok you can stop pretending now woolie
[4:04:33] <andre11dr> BUT THIIISSS ONE THO
[4:04:33] <RWLJr98> FUNgineer
[4:04:33] <+MugenSandan> the Woolie train has pulled into the station
[4:04:37] <%Grimlockfly> "Hey maybe I should play Sekiro again..." *remembers this boss fight* grimlo8Angry grimlo8Angry grimlo8Angry grimlo8Angry
[4:04:38] <Ashenik1> yeah woolie we all know you are white
[4:04:38] <JohnRadical> It always surprises me to see Woolie do good in FromSoft games and fighting games, but is still a little awkward in FPS'
[4:04:43] <%BinaryFireball> @andre11dr like all fromsoft games things become easy once you've beat them. Genchiro here is very similar to the one you fought before
[4:04:43] <andre11dr> NOW THIS IS THE ONE
[4:04:49] <+robosqueeb> seriously woolz? that's not bad advice just pop one
[4:04:58] <MeMillionthDollar> UNLESS, you kill the headless
[4:05:01] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Spirit Emblems are consumable
[4:05:02] <Coystick> That's the problem with Souls items
[4:05:03] <+robosqueeb> plus headless ones are reusable
[4:05:09] <Devbob98> Woolie got that Pat brain
[4:05:09] <Flare3500> Hesitation on Screen
[4:05:09] <T_Sasquatch> No item run pogges
[4:05:12] <StarlessAH> Spiritfalls are sugars that last forever
[4:05:13] <+SouLucha> Mind Goblins?
[4:05:14] <+robosqueeb> goblins
[4:05:17] <KingOfTheGeats> pretty sure you have infinite uses if you kill the Headless
[4:05:17] <Coystick> Souls items should be on cooldown
[4:05:18] <JohnRadical> Gohan?
[4:05:19] <MeMillionthDollar> USE THE SPIRITFALL ONES
[4:05:20] <%baronblank> @JohnRadical I like to think I'm pretty good at Souls games and fighting games myself and I suck at FPS's
[4:05:23] <andre11dr> Gohan?
[4:05:25] <%CptnCampy61> Pat?
[4:05:25] <xbb1024> become as Pat
[4:05:26] <danknugglit> DO IT NO GOHAN
[4:05:28] <+robosqueeb> 35 IN STORAGE
[4:05:28] <ReaderWatcherPlayer> Sekiro was probably designed with Spirit Emblems in mind.
[4:05:30] <brunoberserk> the way of PAT
[4:05:32] <cumurasame> Insert ProZD Ether Meme RIGHT here
[4:05:32] <%Javaa01> You literally have 38 of them, and this is the final boss
[4:05:36] <gamewarden92> This is not the way of motivation.
[4:05:38] <andre11dr> Will Gohan help us ?
[4:05:40] <vVAstrAVv> its the last boss eoolie WILL YOU NEED THEM LATER THAN THAT
[4:05:41] <+balkonas1> You got limitless gokans
[4:05:44] <%Javaa01> So, ya know, ProZD bit writes itself
[4:05:45] <+robosqueeb> @javaa01 he might need them later
[4:05:47] <Johannen> @Javaa01 But what if he needs them later
[4:05:48] <Ashenik1> OhNo Woolie has become a ginger
[4:05:57] <+robosqueeb> LUL
[4:06:04] <VJdarkworld> NotLikeThis
[4:06:05] <Coystick> But what if he needs them AFTER the final boss, smarty pants?
[4:06:08] <T_Sasquatch> No item runnnn
[4:06:11] <rosemon5001> ohh noes
[4:06:13] <+OblivionSword1> technical difficulties
[4:06:13] <cumurasame> "I'm out of MP." "Then use an Ether." "You can't buy ethers." "This is the final battle!" "But I only have 39 of them"
[4:06:15] <danknugglit> Oh no
[4:06:16] <MihajloMBlood> I read that differently at first @Ashenik1
[4:06:18] <pennykettle_> It's not a pat thing or even a woolie thing, it's factual. hes not saving them for after the boss. He's not sure he can beat the boss this attempt so he's not going to use consumables
[4:06:19] <MeMillionthDollar> The Mind Goblins are Rallying
[4:06:19] <andre11dr> Damn, the recording exploded?
[4:06:21] <JonKhan> It's not about needing it later. It's about getting used to having a limited resource
[4:06:22] <RWLJr98> The rule of RPG's is to never use ITEMS EVER
[4:06:26] <Matt_Cowdery> did he do sculptor already?
[4:06:30] <Devbob98> Yeah the recording wink wink
[4:06:33] <brunoberserk> oh oh SPAGGHETI OH
[4:06:35] <VJdarkworld> windows 10 noises NotLikeThis
[4:06:38] <danknugglit> Deep breath
[4:06:39] <%ChoculaUltra> yep, he did Sculptor
[4:06:41] <+MugenSandan> He's keeping the sugars so he can give them to Kuro psaDogchamp
[4:06:46] <Coystick> Using items is Hesitation
[4:06:50] <Raldavar> Pat sensei taught Woolie well as a joke
[4:06:57] <pennykettle_> y'all are numbskulls. He's not saving for after fight, he's not using them now because if he dies theyre gone
[4:07:04] <MeMillionthDollar> USE ROCK
[4:07:07] <MeMillionthDollar> BECOME GIANT
[4:07:10] <Ashenik1> @MihajloMBlood cmonBruh
[4:07:24] <MihajloMBlood> Yeah, like that...
[4:07:25] <+robosqueeb> @pennykettle_ if only he could hold 3...one per phase
[4:07:41] <Ashenik1> @MihajloMBlood I mean Kappa
[4:07:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:07:42] <+SouLucha> Oh hey, so Havel really is in this game too!
[4:07:50] <MihajloMBlood> Yeah... @Ashenik1
[4:07:50] <pennykettle_> @robosqueeb and if he dies in phase 2? Now he has 1 left and he has to start the boss over
[4:07:53] <JohnRadical> "Very... Gooood"
[4:08:07] <pennykettle_> if he runs out he has to go farm
[4:08:11] <+robosqueeb> the plan is if he uses them he won't die LUL

[4:14:15] <Ashenik1> Woolie wants blood
[4:14:15] <kazataca> This is the run!!
[4:14:16] <VJdarkworld> Ride The Lightning DxCat
[4:14:16] <pennykettle_> The lightning counter is really finicky
[4:14:19] <Coystick> Pause is banned
[4:14:21] <Basic_Birch_> Woolie discovering new tech
[4:14:24] <MeMillionthDollar> GIB ME RAW RICE
[4:14:28] <+SouLucha> You can use sugar in-between health bars, that's it.
[4:14:34] <andre11dr> Ive been here again Orphan way to many times
[4:14:38] <danknugglit> All around me are familiar faces
[4:14:41] <%baka_sugoi> gun got him afte that second lighting
[4:14:42] <Spearweaver> Pause is hesitation
[4:14:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:45] <Coystick> Das right
[4:14:46] <Flare3500> If you want to sugar use it during phase transistion
[4:15:02] <Tracazoid> Getting into the flow of combat is the ultimate buff
[4:15:06] <MeMillionthDollar> This time you have it Woolie!
[4:15:08] <Coystick> All you need is flow, he's a rhythm boss, not a puzzle boss.
[4:15:17] <RWLJr98> Woolie mad
[4:15:19] <RWLJr98> :(
[4:15:26] <wibbwobbler> all you need is heal
[4:15:32] <andre11dr> Woolie is not mad
[4:15:33] <%CptnCampy61> That’s actually a really good quote
[4:15:35] <+krispen_wa> @coystick but he sucked at arkham, which was a rhythm game
[4:15:36] <Ashenik1> pasue button in japanese is spelled HeSitation
[4:15:36] <Coystick> Minimalism is victory
[4:15:37] <syzmachine> I feel like if you used the sugar early you could save some heals for the last phase?
[4:15:39] <%ThisIsLloyd> woolie not mad just trying to talk over
[4:15:39] <%ChoculaUltra> He's focused
[4:15:40] <andre11dr> He's just in it
[4:15:45] <danknugglit> Just dont die 4Head
[4:15:53] <T_Sasquatch> You can do it !
[4:15:58] <+JD0394> There are moments to use sugars but if you’re struggling to focus on them then yeah

[4:18:15] <+b_aleph> @SouLucha confirmation bias
[4:18:17] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa I did that for Halo and it was fucking tiering
[4:18:23] <+kknutson4> I beat this guy by being a coward and sprinting around the whole time and taking pot shots when I could

[4:18:54] <danknugglit> It took me 5 hours before i gave up for two weeks then it took another couple hours LUL
[4:19:06] <Doctadaking> Took me all night
[4:19:06] <pennykettle_> I assume 99% of people had a very had time with this fight. If you didn't, cool
[4:19:15] <RWLJr98> 24 hour stream KomodoHype
[4:19:22] <Devbob98> If only you could shot him with gun
[4:19:24] <@Menitta> yeah thats really pretty

[4:19:47] <Coystick> Woolie is dying
[4:19:56] <lotharrio> What a thrill...
[4:19:56] <andre11dr> Ok about 2 hours, not even that much
[4:19:57] <Ashenik1> Woolie think about Naruto
[4:19:57] <blairINtheUSA> Has Woolie talked about about Melty Blood? I just saw the news.
[4:20:05] <+b_aleph> I've played the game right until DOH and then I dropped it like I drop all other games right at the ending
[4:20:11] <Ashenik1> what he had to go through to become a Hokage
[4:20:12] <Coystick> Naruto will give you strength

[4:21:04] <balthazar758> friction damage
[4:21:05] <Coystick> this is hesitation in a way
[4:21:08] <T_Sasquatch> Understandable
[4:21:08] <Devbob98> It hurts Minh
[4:21:14] <cumurasame> does... does woolie have the same problem my dad has where you play so hard your thumbs go purple
[4:21:22] <ullyzeez> i think you hold it too hard man
[4:21:23] <+b_aleph> Carpel tunnel omens

[4:21:36] <RWLJr98> Playstation controllers DansGame Xbox controllers SeemsGood
[4:21:39] <Flare3500> I'm having old man hand problems too where sometimes there's no blood in my hands
[4:21:41] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @SouLucha some guy beat this game with bongos, I think a wii remote would be too easy
[4:21:47] <Coystick> Bring out an Xbox duke controller, that'll cure you
[4:21:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[4:21:47] <spamspaz> This was one of those bossfights where I hit my head against it for many hours in a row, went to bed, woke up the next day, and finished it in one try
[4:21:47] <Ashenik1> When I played Hades I could play with bow for longer than an hour casue my thumb got super fucked :/
[4:21:51] <Devbob98> Opposite Day, this isn’t the one
[4:21:56] <+JD0394> Ps5 controller Kreygasm
[4:22:04] <Guigondi> I sympathize with Woolie's frustration...
[4:22:11] <marumiyan1> what?!
[4:22:14] <+b_aleph> @RWLJr98 this but the exact opposite
[4:22:17] <BUDderzIllA> whoosh
[4:22:21] <T_Sasquatch> How ...... ?
[4:22:21] <andre11dr> Yeah R1 will fuck my finger up sometimes, but that's because i press it way to hard
[4:22:22] <brunoberserk> what
[4:22:25] <@SoushinSen> I think r1 as attack button is dumb as fuck, that's why I change it to square button
[4:22:25] <danknugglit> My ps5 triggers already getting soft :(
[4:22:29] <Coystick> yummy
[4:22:30] <JohnRadical> Life bar go BRRR
[4:22:34] <lotharrio> But you're so... SUPREME!
[4:22:44] <spamspaz> Hesitation is defeat.
[4:22:45] <JetpackMcQuack> punish his ass
[4:22:48] <RWLJr98> @b_aleph well yes, but actually no
[4:22:49] <+TheotherKristian> Woolie go BRRRR
[4:22:50] <@Menitta> After Nioh 2, yeah I hate R1 for attack
[4:22:53] <Ashenik1> A little break?
[4:22:53] <+krispen_wa> MINH IN CHAT!?
[4:22:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> What if Orca from Wind Waker was the final boss:
[4:23:04] <+krispen_wa> TWO PLACES AT ONCE!?
[4:23:05] <Coystick> unseen AIIIIIIIIIDS
[4:23:07] <Devbob98> Don’t cry for me, I’m already dead
[4:23:08] <+OblivionSword1> after playing nioh I agree
[4:23:10] <+b_aleph> @SoushinSen how do you control the camera while attacking?
[4:23:11] <Flare3500> It's so weird every game followed R1 R2 as attack , even God of War
[4:23:15] <VJdarkworld> @soushinsen R1 better for doing attacks unlocked
[4:23:18] <andre11dr> I played too much Souls for R1 to not be attack
[4:23:22] <irregularly_irregular> that was weird... wtf
[4:23:23] <spamspaz> that double overhead best move in the gotdamn game
[4:23:37] <+FackinCrazy> @SoushinSen how long until curfew?
[4:23:40] <@Menitta> I love that enemy step jump double slash animation
[4:23:41] <Ashenik1> In Nioh attack is Squera right?
[4:23:43] <+b_aleph> Shoulder buttons are always the best when you're controlling the sticks
[4:23:47] <+MugenSandan> @soushinsen I used to play Tekken on pad but I had to switch to stick because I was ruining my wrist by using my thumb too much
[4:23:53] <+krispen_wa> nioh is square and triangle
[4:23:54] <@Menitta> In Nioh, attack is square and triangle
[4:24:07] <@Menitta> the shoulder buttons are for stance switching and ki pulse
[4:24:09] <andre11dr> Like action games
[4:24:13] <+kknutson4> How did Woolz do against the DoH?
[4:24:15] <irregularly_irregular> Woolie getting more bold in each successive attempt.
[4:24:21] <stormhawk9891> @Menitta And GUN
[4:24:26] <+b_aleph> @kknutson4 ez
[4:24:28] <andre11dr> Or caracter action is what i meant to say
[4:24:32] <@Menitta> Of course.
[4:24:33] <+krispen_wa> considering how much you have to switch stance and pulse, it's just as bad on the controller
[4:24:48] <Nanomachiner> Ganbare!! Fighting!!
[4:24:55] <danknugglit> High stance>
[4:25:04] <+b_aleph> @krispen_wa Depends on what weapon you're playing
[4:25:04] <JohnRadical> Honestly I might try changing it in the Dark Souls game if that is an actual option. The last controller I hard broke because the right and left bumpers got stuck. You already know why.
[4:25:05] <@Menitta> the only time I had a controller physically hurt me was when I was learning how to use stick
[4:25:05] <DatAsuna> I did try the shoulder button layout for nioh but hated it lol
[4:25:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Imagine if this game had stamina
[4:25:07] <Coystick> NOICE
[4:25:10] <Flare3500> I like the clang sounds
[4:25:14] <bear_breaker20> why does genichiro use some bitch bow when granddad gets a five shot musket?
[4:25:17] <Devbob98> Nice dodge
[4:25:21] <%xcompleasedad> GUN
[4:25:22] <+captain_history> this is such a frustrating but at the same time awesome final boss
[4:25:22] <@Menitta> OH

[4:32:09] <VJdarkworld> NICE
[4:32:13] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Genichiro was a bitch this entire game

[4:33:14] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! Congrats on beating Isshin! I loved this boss so much that I actually had a save backed up prior to the fight so I could redo it as often as I wanted (before they added the boss rush mode). It's so good
[4:33:14] <Aydarkzero> @Awkward_Cyborg Perhaps that is a story best saved... for another day
[4:33:16] <+Zanzibar_Junker> go to idol
[4:33:17] <+penjaza> Yeah, this is the time
[4:33:20] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Gauntlet of Strength also has unique remixes of Owl, Isshin, and Genichiro.

[4:33:50] <brunoberserk> just finish the game , woolie is tired
[4:33:50] <Flare3500> just do it again , you've already passed the exam right ?
[4:33:51] <+FackinCrazy> just quit
[4:33:51] <MeMillionthDollar> There is no way they would make you fight him again
[4:33:54] <RWLJr98> boss respawns Kappa
[4:33:55] <Aydarkzero> you can quit here all good
[4:33:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Secret backdown ending
[4:33:55] <andre11dr> I don't know
[4:33:56] <Devbob98> The boss is dead
[4:34:03] <VJdarkworld> we will find out
[4:34:03] <Josef_Stryker> Did Woolie do the Shura ending?
[4:34:05] <samuelfisk> Yes
[4:34:06] <@Menitta> I;m scared
[4:34:06] <+FlubbedPig> Take a look at Dragon Flash first though?
[4:34:07] <+OblivionSword1> universe says it's good
[4:34:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ggs woolie
[4:34:09] <T_Sasquatch> Game autosaves LUL
[4:34:09] <+SouLucha> Kuro it totally not bleeding out, he's fine!
[4:34:12] <irregularly_irregular> Oh no you've triggered the secret Fromsoft ending!!
[4:34:14] <jorniev> FUCKING ACTIVISION
[4:34:17] <mobile_suit> syke quitting out unlocks the isshin with 5 phases
[4:34:21] <Johannen> @Josef_Stryker Not yet, he never finished the Emma/Ishin fight
[4:34:26] <Flare3500> We'll wait for one week , Kuro be bleeding for one week
[4:34:31] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah, that's worth a sub.
[4:34:34] <+DragonArt07> congrats
[4:34:36] <danknugglit> Blaze it
[4:34:37] <pennykettle_> You won't see it in the LP, but when you start a new game, Kuro will give you an item that turns the game into hard mode, anything but a perfect block deals chip damage
[4:34:39] <+extantCadence> @SouLucha He's immortal so it doesn't really matter
[4:34:39] <Ashenik1> Kuro is a fucking potato salad after this boss fight
[4:34:43] <+penjaza> Managed to squeeze it into one session. Congrats
[4:34:52] <+JD0394> @woolieversus you can totally rest or leave the boss arena and kuro will just lay there bleeding out until you go back
[4:34:57] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:34:57] <matteasyplays> LUL
[4:35:01] <Flare3500> Arthritis was kicking in too
[4:35:04] <VJdarkworld> LUL
[4:35:06] <KingOfTheGeats> you got GUN instead
[4:35:06] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Gen-chan is a bitch
[4:35:07] <Johannen> @pennykettle_ Fun fact, that persists even for a totaly fresh save not even NG+
[4:35:13] <Basic_Birch_> So probably no shura ending?
[4:35:19] <+SouLucha> @extantCadence did get stabbed by a mortal blade so who knows how that works.
[4:35:27] <pennykettle_> @Johannen yes, which is great. It shouldn't be NG+ only
[4:35:30] <+extantCadence> This save backup stuff is way easier on pc
[4:35:38] <Johannen> Wait, did they override their Shura ending?
[4:35:40] <danknugglit> LUL
[4:35:52] <DatAsuna> okay ending time
[4:35:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:36:01] <Ashenik1> LUL
[4:36:03] <Flare3500> Hesitation defeated
[4:36:04] <+extantCadence> @SouLucha If it was as easy as getting stabbed with the mortal blade, they would have just done that
[4:36:14] <+penjaza> I think it's okay to leave Shura for now
[4:36:18] <MeMillionthDollar> Bloodborne stlye
[4:36:25] <huskarl_zap> Alien xenomorph Isshen
[4:36:26] <+FlubbedPig> Gauntlet of Strength also contains unique remixes of Owl, Isshin, and Genichiro. For an example of their new shit, when you send the lightning back at Genichiro he SENDS IT BACK AGAIN
[4:36:31] <pixelkenj> dragged from the underworld
[4:36:33] <Matt_Cowdery> The black mortal blade forced him back to life
[4:36:35] <irregularly_irregular> He used the second Mortal Blade to straight up just revive Isshin.
[4:36:36] <DatAsuna> The second mortal blade is some bullshit
[4:36:36] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Gen wished for Issues n to comeback
[4:36:36] <Spearweaver> mortal blade 1 kills immortals, mortal blade 2 ressurects the dead
[4:36:37] <RWLJr98> crazy anime bull
[4:36:37] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Black Mortal Blade gives life
[4:36:40] <+penjaza> The "Black Blade" is a gateway to hell he summoned his grandpa through
[4:36:40] <+krispen_wa> dont think too hard, he revives because it was hype
[4:36:40] <+MacDatAss> the black mortal blade is called the open gate for a reason
[4:36:45] <Ashenik1> How long did it take to defeat for Woolie?
[4:36:50] <PanicSwytch> His return is not explained
[4:36:50] <vVAstrAVv> genichiro called him back
[4:36:50] <RWLJr98> was it Pat
[4:36:52] <danknugglit> Hes a badass thats all you need to know
[4:36:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "He's doing his Chinese contortionist shit again"
[4:36:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus the black mortal blade can Edo Tensei someone at the cost of the users life
[4:37:00] <pennykettle_> either a dumb comment or patrick
[4:37:00] <DatAsuna> it doesn't make a lot of sense either way
[4:37:02] <irregularly_irregular> it was probably Pat......'s dog.
[4:37:04] <+Awkward_Cyborg> it was someone on the chat
[4:37:04] <+robosqueeb> probably pat lmfao
[4:37:07] <linSP> WHO SAID SWORD SAINT
[4:37:07] <VJdarkworld> chat was spoiling it hard
[4:37:08] <+penjaza> Someone said "Sword Saint"
[4:37:09] <+Grayhammatter> aw
[4:37:09] <+SouLucha> Yeah lots of people wouldn't shut up about it.
[4:37:17] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[4:37:19] <MeMillionthDollar> Fuck that guy
[4:37:19] <pixelkenj> swushDink
[4:37:20] <jorniev> isshin is the boss of the bad end right?
[4:37:23] <+FlubbedPig> Test out Dragon Flash!
[4:37:24] <+NocturnePsycho> smartasses jesus
[4:37:25] <danknugglit> ONE GUY
[4:37:25] <+Grayhammatter> that was many one guys
[4:37:26] <jv5_guy> wait that isnt reggie
[4:37:29] <%Grimlockfly> Party500 Congrats on beating the tough fight!
[4:37:31] <jv5_guy> LUL
[4:37:31] <+SouLucha> Too many guys.
[4:37:34] <binaryanomaly16> That one guy strikes again
[4:37:36] <DatAsuna> Pat did say sword saint but he didn't correct him to ishin
[4:37:37] <PanicSwytch> There are 2 black blades, one of life and one of death
[4:37:39] <RWLJr98> Im bleeeeeeding out
[4:37:40] <Flare3500> My shota oh no
[4:37:41] <pennykettle_> laugh at bleeding child
[4:37:42] <Johannen> No Shura ending? BOOOOOOOOo
[4:37:44] <irregularly_irregular> llega el tren del hype
[4:37:45] <fangovafang> damn smh
[4:37:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FeelsBadMan
[4:37:49] <+SouLucha> It's fine!
[4:37:53] <Flare3500> Give him a blowjob
[4:37:55] <+b_aleph> @DatAsuna I said sword saint too, so it may be my fault
[4:37:57] <+penjaza> Go for shitty ending first
[4:37:59] <ZenZottle> Did he do it ? I missed it!
[4:38:05] <primaryfire> Severance, Purification and Return
[4:38:07] <+b_aleph> Was it ever said that Isshin was the sword saint before?
[4:38:09] <jorniev> I DID A SHIT LOAD OF SIDE QUEST for this shit kid you better live
[4:38:12] <linSP> Bad end, you did not find the imposter
[4:38:14] <%baronblank> sort of
[4:38:14] <+penjaza> Yep
[4:38:15] <+FlubbedPig> Standard, Emma, Child
[4:38:15] <+extantCadence> Shura ending kinda sucks
[4:38:17] <%ChoculaUltra> probably LUL
[4:38:18] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna if it makes you feel better it's come up a lot more than once
[4:38:21] <Johannen> Is Woolie realy gonna ignore the best Ishin fight in the game? Did he already deleted that save?
[4:38:21] <+SouLucha> lytLURK
[4:38:22] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Yes sing while he dies
[4:38:25] <samuelfisk> My favorite is Purification
[4:38:29] <RWLJr98> dumb kid born with dumb blood
[4:38:34] <pennykettle_> I don't like ranking endings by "goodness" because people conflate moral good with "quality of the ending"
[4:38:40] <Flare3500> I never really understood how did the arm worked , it's literally made of strings
[4:38:41] <danknugglit> Mmmmm
[4:38:48] <+xyxlzyzm> great job woolie
[4:38:51] <+JD0394> “Probably” thanks for the help Minh
[4:39:00] <pennykettle_> monkaS
[4:39:01] <lotharrio> It's a complicated puppet, @Flare3500
[4:39:01] <+penjaza> I always feel bad not picking the third option when I get it since she literally blinds herself to make it possible
[4:39:02] <Ashenik1> @Flare3500 magic?
[4:39:03] <%ChoculaUltra> oh fuck
[4:39:03] <VJdarkworld> i only rank endings based on "POGGIES"
[4:39:03] <+OblivionSword1> @Flare3500 it's shinobi magic
[4:39:05] <CoffeeSlice> :(
[4:39:11] <+paladinstarbuster> what do dragon tears taste like?
[4:39:13] <matteasyplays> :(
[4:39:14] <linSP> just killing the kid is more of a neutral end imo
[4:39:20] <+Grayhammatter> :(
[4:39:24] <irregularly_irregular> I know that the EVIL RED GAS that emanates from the sword is meant to make it look CURSED af but it just kinda looks stinky.
[4:39:25] <+MacDatAss> F
[4:39:26] <+Awkward_Cyborg> here, i'm gonna kill this kid
[4:39:26] <@Menitta> I, Sekiro, will be the Shadow who Dies Twice

[4:39:53] <Flare3500> Dun Dun DUNN The twist
[4:39:56] <Aydarkzero> this ending made me feel sad
[4:39:58] <lyzejag> WE DID IT, WE SAVED THE CITY
[4:39:59] <CoffeeSlice> Kuro just wanted a quiet life
[4:40:00] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[4:40:00] <The_Grand_J> LORD OF CINDER FALLEN

[4:40:34] <VJdarkworld> NEED. MORE. POWER
[4:40:35] <MeMillionthDollar> Oh GAD
[4:40:39] <Devbob98> Time loop, time loop
[4:40:41] <Spearweaver> fromsoft loves their cycles
[4:40:42] <pennykettle_> The initial stinger/teaser for Sekiro was more interesting than the real game IMO haha
[4:40:43] <lyzejag> CYCLES, AGAIN
[4:40:43] <Flare3500> Boruto next gen
[4:40:43] <DatAsuna> fuck cycles tbh
[4:40:44] <jv5_guy> doodSad
[4:40:45] <%ChoculaUltra> Sekiro 2 : The New Challengers?
[4:40:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Remember when we thought that was Bloodborne 2?
[4:40:48] <lotharrio> Seeking strength, but missing exactly one arm on the right side.
[4:40:49] <andre11dr> Also this ending is VERY Bloodborne
[4:40:50] <+penjaza> The next guy with his arm cut off in the same spot
[4:40:51] <kazataca> Thats silly
[4:40:51] <@Solidus_113> and you become the secret superboss in the sequel
[4:40:53] <jorniev> BIONIC COMANDO PREQUEL
[4:40:57] <vVAstrAVv> FUUUUUUCK that
[4:40:57] <huskarl_zap> someone made a emma emote?
[4:40:58] <Ashenik1> well..
[4:41:00] <+krispen_wa> Dragons dogma
[4:41:03] <valriot> I wanna know WHOS arm it is tbh
[4:41:06] <+OblivionSword1> it's a very typical Fromsoft ending
[4:41:06] <MeMillionthDollar> I like it
[4:41:07] <+SouLucha> Fighting Sekiro of the Flame would be pretty dope.
[4:41:13] <DatAsuna> Dragon's dogma does that best yee
[4:41:16] <irregularly_irregular> well even if the next guy loses a leg.... he's getting a prosthetic arm.
[4:41:20] <+MugenSandan> The Dragon's Return ending is the REAL SEQUEL BAIT
[4:41:24] <danknugglit> Now youre the host of the dream
[4:41:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yes it was time travel
[4:41:25] <kazataca> This is some DS2 shenanigans
[4:41:26] <%ChoculaUltra> definitely no LUL
[4:41:30] <bigshedman> We sleeping on Gradius 5's timeloop?!
[4:41:37] <+MacDatAss> you cant choose the next ending
[4:41:38] <+Pinkiefan> Hades is my favorite version of that.
[4:41:38] <+extantCadence> NG+ can’t be canonical here because the world state has changed so much
[4:41:43] <Afrosamasenpai> noooooo i missed the old man killing
[4:41:49] <pennykettle_> At least it asks unlike bloodborne and ds1 and des

[4:42:38] <Matt_Cowdery> Not ishiin, the sculptor
[4:42:42] <CoffeeSlice> Sculptor is Sekijo

[4:43:46] <%SainEdge> That is Sculptor
[4:43:50] <+FlubbedPig> Yeah it is
[4:43:50] <+extantCadence> The first time I saw someone playing the boss rush in this game I honestly thought it was a mod
[4:43:55] <%baka_sugoi> sekijo
[4:43:58] <pennykettle_> Isshin names you
[4:44:00] <primaryfire> Xno that's a name given to you by tengu
[4:44:02] <+FlubbedPig> Sekijo not Sekiro
[4:44:09] <+MacDatAss> its the sculptor when he was still a ninja
[4:44:12] <+SouLucha> None of this orange jacket stuff? Like what kind of Ninja wears ORANGE?! Kappa

[4:45:05] <MeMillionthDollar> WHo?!?!
[4:45:05] <+MugenSandan> SekiJO after ShoJO which is Japanese for Orangutan, the Sculptor's old name
[4:45:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sekijoey Wheeler
[4:45:09] <@Menitta> Sekijo mama

[4:46:31] <andre11dr> I wish you could just play as Ishin
[4:46:32] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Sekijo is not a new detail. You heard it back in the original playthrough years ago
[4:46:38] <+extantCadence> Did Woolie beat Demon?
[4:46:39] <vVAstrAVv> memory up for the lore
[4:46:40] <primaryfire> confronting the memory will give you a unique description yea

[4:47:39] <Aydarkzero> Finish up whats left NG LUL
[4:47:45] <+OblivionSword1> load that save file baby
[4:48:11] <+FallenAngelSC2> The real Sekiro was all the deaths we died along the way
[4:48:24] <+extantCadence> Oh he’s gonna get this “costume unlocked” thing for every ending
[4:48:25] <Johannen> So why did he saved over the Shura ending? To watch the dning that have no gameplay change?
[4:48:38] <+FlubbedPig> It's still super weird to me that Bloodborne just kicks you into NG+ immediately.
[4:48:47] <RWLJr98> we see reflection
[4:48:48] <andre11dr> Looking at you DS1 DS2 and DS3
[4:49:08] <+balkonas1> @johannen you gonna stoo crying about the Shura ending?
[4:49:09] <mobile_suit> DS2 and 3 don't boot you straight to NG+
[4:49:10] <mobile_suit> just 1
[4:49:21] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus At least watch the Shura Ishin Phase 2
[4:49:21] <andre11dr> Oh actually wait that's right
[4:49:34] <andre11dr> Just DS1 and Bloodborne
[4:49:42] <pennykettle_> demons does it
[4:49:48] <+krispen_wa> Forever bleeding on the floor
[4:49:57] <%slimmixrp> Do the best one just in case

[4:50:10] <%baronblank> demon's souls certainly does
[4:50:10] <+FlubbedPig> Not DS2. Bloodborne forces you
[4:50:13] <@Menitta> Bloodborne shoots you right into NG Plus doesnt it
[4:50:13] <+extantCadence> DS2 was the first one that didn’t boot you to NG+ immediately
[4:50:14] <pennykettle_> DS2 was the first to ask if you want to go to NG+
[4:50:14] <@Solidus_113> DS2 you can hold off
[4:50:17] <Matt_Cowdery> Nope
[4:50:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DS3 lets you pick too
[4:50:30] <+krispen_wa> DS2 had the worst gameplay but the best QoL
[4:50:48] <Aydarkzero> sunrise
[4:50:52] <brunoberserk> DS1 , Des and Bloodborne just throw you in the NG+

[4:52:02] <RWLJr98> PHASE 5
[4:52:04] <KaiserMario> Become Human
[4:52:07] <andre11dr> I don't think Ive ever seen this one
[4:52:13] <Ashenik1> @pennykettle_ LUL
[4:52:15] <%ChoculaUltra> Sekiro 2 : Prosthetic Head
[4:52:18] <Aydarkzero> this one i feel is the weakest
[4:52:19] <samuelfisk> I like this ending best.
[4:52:19] <+Dragon4234> Guess Wolf's not gonna be in Sekiro 2
[4:52:19] <PanicSwytch> He has to kill himself to remove the immortality from kuro
[4:52:21] <Johannen> So Woolie "suffered" thru doing gameplay stuff for non interactive endings he could have watched, and ignored the Shura Boss Fight? Biggest Boss backdown
[4:52:24] <Robot_Nixon_> wait how do you even behead yourself? that blade must be sharp Kappa
[4:52:24] <+snugglepuggs> Sekiro Become Human

[4:52:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @ChoculaUltra LUL
[4:52:28] <primaryfire> I like this ending the best as well
[4:52:28] <danknugglit> Better end
[4:52:31] <+FallenAngelSC2> woolieONEGUY woolieGIRLS woolieFUN
[4:52:32] <srv4254> best ending
[4:52:37] <Ashenik1> @ChoculaUltra LUL
[4:52:37] <+krispen_wa> @johannen holy fuck stop being woolieONEGUY
[4:52:38] <a_mad_dragon_> he can be like malcom mcdowell in tank girl, just give him a holographic head
[4:52:39] <pennykettle_> I don't remember why Sekiro had to die. Maybe because he was the last immortality lingering that Kuro provides?
[4:52:39] <VJdarkworld> NERO
[4:52:41] <andre11dr> I think Ive seen just the Sculptor and the Journey to west ones
[4:52:41] <lotharrio> I think this is the one I went for.
[4:52:46] <linSP> he severed his own immortality with the flower so Kuro could live
[4:52:47] <RWLJr98> Sekiro: The Next Generation
[4:52:53] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus In Everblossom ending, you're able to sever Kuro's immortality and let him live by killing the person who is also bound to his immortality: yourself.
[4:52:54] <%baronblank> @pennykettle_ yep
[4:52:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BORUTO
[4:53:03] <danknugglit> Sekiro 2 BOY dies twice
[4:53:03] <pennykettle_> He wanted to finish today, he's not loading a save that far back and doing more bosses
[4:53:04] <green2814> Yeah basically Sekiro had to die to cut off Kuro's immortality
[4:53:07] <jorniev> @a_mad_dragon_ WHY are you making a reference to that!?
[4:53:07] <+krispen_wa> BORUTO
[4:53:08] <%ChoculaUltra> he must now travel to Yharnam Kappa
[4:53:16] <kazataca> This looks very canon/main ending
[4:53:18] <+snugglepuggs> Kuro has grey hair like Sekiro
[4:53:26] <Ashenik1> lets go explore and....and he got attack by the bandits 2 mailes from castle and died
[4:53:30] <RWLJr98> hes gonna fall off the cliff!
[4:53:32] <PanicSwytch> I want a Kuro game
[4:53:34] <Robot_Nixon_> @Johannen he has it up on his youtube, you should stop now atpCap
[4:53:42] <Aydarkzero> and then he died on the way out of the town
[4:53:48] <SixthShinx> Wisdom beyond your years
[4:53:49] <DatAsuna> mushishi style
[4:53:49] <wibbwobbler> I like this one lol
[4:53:52] <Johannen> @Tuna_Can_0 He never done Shura thou
[4:53:55] <pennykettle_> Claire Saffitz "one grey stripe"
[4:53:56] <irregularly_irregular> He will travel to either DS or Bloodborneworld and become one of those non-specific asian NPCs.
[4:53:58] <danknugglit> He died to bandits 20 minutes later
[4:54:02] <Ashenik1> Woolie will love the witcher 3 then Kappa
[4:54:06] <andre11dr> Im pretty sure the Journey to The West ending is supposed to be the cannon main one
[4:54:12] <Robot_Nixon_> @Johannen yes he did. He fought emma and ishin
[4:54:25] <linSP> I thought the cradle ending was canon
[4:54:36] <Johannen> @Tuna_Can_0 He gave up and never reached Phase 2 even, you clearly didnt watch
[4:54:47] <+krispen_wa> now he's a real boy
[4:54:50] <+MugenSandan> So this ending can be seen as a reference to Minamoto no Yoshitsune, as this could be considered the start of his Journey to become Yoshitsune, as Yoshitsune had the pet name "Kuro" as a child
[4:54:51] <Ashenik1> And now the cool ending
[4:55:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now the best ending
[4:55:02] <Art__Thief> Isn't there a little girl who's also Immortal?
[4:55:08] <%hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus Can you please read the memory of Isshin's Soul? It's great.
[4:55:10] <Robot_Nixon_> @Johannen is it that important to whine this much about?
[4:55:11] <%hax_metatron> Isshin Memory
[4:55:14] <+extantCadence> Yeah, he’s now mortal and basically in the middle of a warzone, so you know. His chances are definitely really good.

[4:58:09] <pennykettle_> Centipede immortality is the worst. That's the kind where you die in an avalanche and you're buried forever
[4:58:10] <irregularly_irregular> killing hollows purifies them

[5:05:27] <+FlubbedPig> Have the child consume snake guts to get her pregnant
[5:05:27] <Indigo_Automaton> Guys I think she just absorbed his soul and memories
[5:05:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they're supposed to go to china to return the immortaility

[5:11:07] <gamewarden92> Because it looks like Kuro got unbirthed! It's just what you see on the screen!
[5:11:08] <MeMillionthDollar> No Not Preggo

[5:11:09] <%AmuserName> sHE'S gROGNANTZ
[5:11:09] <+extantCadence> The truly offensive thing about this game, though, is the suggestion that cold rice is somehow better than warm rice
[5:11:10] <Zombrocom> @WoolieVersus Because you want it to be pregnancy
[5:11:11] <kazataca> She look preggo

[5:11:14] <andre11dr> HOOOOOO
[5:11:16] <jorniev> *BONK*
[5:11:16] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus I just thought of the OTHER unbirth game ending. Fucking Shadow of the Colossus.
[5:11:17] <+Kaask> the child is not pregnant no
[5:11:18] <+Solutha> She didnt hold her womb lmao
[5:11:18] <auso912> conclusion: kill all babies
[5:11:18] <Ashenik1> rule 34 has conclusions
[5:11:19] <andimustmask> true owl?
[5:11:20] <Basic_Birch_> Kuro is inside her kokoro
[5:11:21] <marumiyan1> @extantCadence hot rice is the only rice
[5:11:21] <+loukemia83> She has the immortal part of his soul, not his physical body
[5:11:22] <lotharrio> Pregzilla vs Unbirth Kong
[5:11:23] <LaughingCatt> Its Vore tag, not Pregnant tag
[5:11:25] <andre11dr> THAT WAS LONG AND ROUGH
[5:11:26] <+FackinCrazy> She has a giant belly how is that not pregnant
[5:11:29] <Art__Thief> Wolf is Pregnant the whole time.
[5:11:30] <danknugglit> LUL
[5:11:31] <shorololo> there is no preggo, woolie apparently thinks babies are born from the chest area
[5:11:31] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:11:32] <DatAsuna> shura's pretty easy
[5:11:33] <andimustmask> shura ending?
[5:11:36] <+b_aleph> LUL
[5:11:38] <Josef_Stryker> I just figured it was more like Piccolo fusing with Nail and Kami
[5:11:39] <andre11dr> It's not worth
[5:11:39] <Zombrocom> She does not have a giant belly though
[5:11:39] <%Irridium> LUL
[5:11:39] <bevyrage> everyone who thinks this is about pregnancy is dumb. the culture this game derives from has the gesture of the hand over HER HEART means THE SOUL LIVES ON IN HER HEART. western folk should have gotten this too.
[5:11:44] <danknugglit> !SHOOK!
[5:11:49] <+FlubbedPig> Did you not catch that the boss name was Sword Saint Isshin?
[5:11:54] <+b_aleph> @Zombrocom that takes several months
[5:11:56] <pennykettle_> @WoolieVersus if you go to new game or NG+, Kuro will now give you a new item that lets you enable Hard Mode, its perfect parries only
[5:11:59] <RWLJr98> she literally caresses her upper stomach
[5:11:59] <Josef_Stryker> Don't you still have to do the Shura ending?
[5:12:00] <StarlessAH> Where is the ending where Kuro gets unbirthed into Sekiro's balls, who then puts her in Emma?
[5:12:01] <+yukichocomilk> 100% pregnant
[5:12:04] <Ashenik1> @bevyrage ITS WOOLIE NOT ME ;(
[5:12:04] <TheQuadrupleS> She did not touch her chest
[5:12:06] <%SainEdge> @bevyrage exactly
[5:12:09] <+extantCadence> @flubbedpig That’s not unbirth, it’s “just” age regression

[5:12:18] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus you dont need if you want it , dude
[5:12:20] <andimustmask> he gets to spawn with an automatic flintlock pistol
[5:12:21] <%hax_metatron> It's the first FromSoft boss you fight at their peak
[5:12:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Peak murder
[5:12:30] <+b_aleph> It's called UNBIRTH for fuck's sake, he's not in her heart
[5:12:33] <+FackinCrazy> 100% pregnant
[5:12:34] <PanicSwytch> He did the shura ending last stream
[5:12:35] <danknugglit> Experience
[5:12:35] <Ashenik1> nah its like 40-50
[5:12:35] <Matt_Cowdery> No, he wasnt old, he was middle aged
[5:12:36] <KaiserMario> He wasn't elderly in the fight
[5:12:40] <Psyramics> he would have enjoyed it longer if not for someone
[5:12:40] <andimustmask> his hair's a tad darker when he spawns
[5:12:41] <+NameInsertable> Fight king Vendrik at his peak woolie
[5:12:41] <andre11dr> Back when Ishin was bumping trap beats
[5:12:46] <%baronblank> reborn isshin wasn't old
[5:12:46] <Ashenik1> ha was a veterean warrior
[5:12:49] <%SainEdge> his peak was when he conquered Ashina, like in the intro
[5:12:52] <Johannen> @PanicSwytch What stream were you watching?
[5:12:54] <linSP> he was younger in the final fight wasn’t he
[5:12:56] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't reborn Isshin like in his prime and shit
[5:13:01] <BUDderzIllA> FromSoft games have this weird thing with old men being the final bosses and kicking ass like crazy
[5:13:04] <samuelfisk> Isshin was 90. Saint is like 50.
[5:13:10] <Ashenik1> like 50 year old vetereans would destroy 20 fresh soldiers!
[5:13:16] <marumiyan1> yea just google it
[5:13:16] <+Grayhammatter> hot goog
[5:13:17] <andre11dr> As usual for From games
[5:13:18] <%ChoculaUltra> I want a prequel dlc with a young Isshin, like a 25 year old yankee Isshin. With blackjack and hookers.
[5:13:19] <+invida> Sekiro: Shadows Birth Twice
[5:13:20] <JDebss> Well done Woolz!
[5:13:22] <marumiyan1> SHES NOT PREGGO
[5:13:23] <%Irridium> hot goog huh
[5:13:26] <%hax_metatron> Imagine fighting Allant / Gwyn / Vendrick / Gael / Gehrman at their peak
[5:13:30] <Josef_Stryker> Ah so no Shura ending?
[5:13:32] <+xyxlzyzm> you don't get to be 50yo as a warrior without being able to absolutely whoop ass
[5:13:32] <Art__Thief> Wolf was pregnant.
[5:13:34] <+ArthurDayne88> Please dont say hot goog ever again
[5:13:36] <Basic_Birch_> So a Fromsoft game lol
[5:13:41] <Ashenik1> its both Woolie

[5:13:44] <penitentpendant> "Mystery ending"
[5:13:44] <+Jiggisnipe> idk I'm rewatching it and the hand is like on the top of her belly
[5:13:44] <danknugglit> Sekiro was pregnant
[5:13:45] <%KiwamiKiryu> She does looked preggo but it's a Kingdom Hearts
[5:13:47] <+SouLucha> It looked like she placed it on her heart.
[5:13:48] <+FlubbedPig> A lot of people read it as pregnant, but there's room for interpretation.
[5:13:49] <VJdarkworld> buddhism rebirth type beat
[5:13:50] <Spearweaver> that's why they're going to China, to fix the problem
[5:13:51] <+MugenSandan> I wanna cry, it was just a big Journey to the West reference forget the pregnancy crap
[5:13:51] <JDebss> Isshin was pragnant
[5:13:52] <brunoberserk> MIYAZAKI , ANSWER US
[5:13:53] <+paladinstarbuster> ITs like nail
[5:13:54] <lotharrio> Gonna do "something" in China.
[5:13:54] <+Jiggisnipe> cut the difference, it's both
[5:13:59] <gamewarden92> Maybe the real pregnancy is the unbirth we are all thinking about now.
[5:14:00] <green2814> He's dead but the curse is passed onto her to bring back to China
[5:14:00] <vVAstrAVv> woolie please just get over it its sequal bait is all lol
[5:14:01] <+FingaLights> They go to the source west
[5:14:02] <andre11dr> WHERE'S VATI WHEN WE NEED HIM
[5:14:03] <s_snowball> why does reincarnation have to be birth in a world like sekiro
[5:14:05] <%Irridium> they're all pregnant
[5:14:08] <+extantCadence> @hax_metatron I feel like you do fight Gael at his peak
[5:14:08] <+SouLucha> She ate snake hearts to upgrade her own!
[5:14:15] <+SouLucha> You know how it works!
[5:14:16] <%ChoculaUltra> "Gawrsh, now Kuro can rest inside me, hyuck!" - Goofy, Kingdom Hearts IV
[5:14:17] <bevyrage> that's how he would be saved, by not being in the cycle
[5:14:21] <+b_aleph> To get her pregnant
[5:14:21] <+yukichocomilk> I only trust vaati
[5:14:25] <pennykettle_> Technically you did save him. I think he's alive and sharing a body
[5:14:33] <JDebss> Owl and Isshin both pregnant
[5:14:36] <%SainEdge> gestures like this a so common when a character think of people who are "watching them" or are like spirits that live inside them
[5:14:42] <danknugglit> Hesitation is pregnant
[5:14:43] <VJdarkworld> phone in Vaati to get preggo confirm or deny
[5:14:49] <%AyotoCorp> Third ending is just a Journey to the West reference
[5:15:03] <Ashenik1> dont hesitate, pull out
[5:15:11] <andimustmask> hesitation is defeat
[5:15:12] <DatAsuna> yea that checks out
[5:15:15] <andre11dr> Next time im in Vaatis stream I'll ask if Dragon ending is prego L

[5:15:54] <balthazar758> "absorbed"
[5:15:55] <%Irridium> "the cradling ritual to absorb(?) Kuro"
[5:15:58] <+Grayhammatter> he was soul vore'd

[5:15:58] <+FingaLights> Soul vore
[5:15:59] <+b_aleph> SHE ATE THE BABY

[5:18:46] <%hax_metatron> No wait 3
[5:18:47] <+extantCadence> It's expensive at 3 emblems each use @WoolieVersus
[5:18:47] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus There's also a new move added in the Gauntlet update. Called Sakura Dance.

[5:19:17] <+extantCadence> You just go over a whole lot of attacks
[5:19:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's basically "im evil now"
[5:19:20] <+SouLucha> Shura ending is pretty metal.
[5:19:20] <andimustmask> since you'll miss the VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL of the shura ending otherwise
[5:19:24] <KaiserMario> Woolie VS REACTS
[5:19:25] <samuelfisk> Just YouTube it.
[5:19:33] <andre11dr> Shura ending is very lame
[5:19:35] <+SouLucha> I like what happens to Genichiro in Shura ending.
[5:19:50] <DatAsuna> is that darin depaul??

[5:20:09] <Ashenik1> they become british empire
[5:20:11] <%ChoculaUltra> one of the cooler small bits is that in the Shura Isshin fight, if you parry his One Mind attack Isshin's posture bar shoots tf up
[5:20:20] <DatAsuna> Yeah that's the emperor in swtor too lol

[5:21:51] <+loukemia83> if you're thinking about being Shura, just stop guys, okay? just stop
[5:21:53] <%ChoculaUltra> they shoulda let you dual wield both Mortal Blades on a Shura NG+
[5:21:54] <%KiwamiKiryu> Imagine that voice getting someone preggo

[5:22:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:22:02] <danknugglit> Good end :)
[5:22:06] <MeMillionthDollar> Sekiro a bad boy
[5:22:12] <+extantCadence> Oh yeah, Genichiro does just die offscreen like a loser in that ending, doesn't he?
[5:22:13] <JDebss> Best end
[5:22:18] <+FlubbedPig> It's probably the worst line read in the English Dub, yeah

[5:22:30] <%KiwamiKiryu> woolieMIRIN
[5:22:30] <pennykettle_> That line delivery is all I remember from the ending
[5:22:32] <%SainEdge> @WoolieVersus fun fact about the shura ending: Owl has genichiros head in his hands in the begining. You cant really see it without cheating tho
[5:22:33] <+Grayhammatter> BUSTA WOLF BabyRage
[5:22:40] <andre11dr> So are Shura the same as Ashura ? Or is it a different thing
[5:22:50] <JDebss> Clap

[5:23:49] <%KiwamiKiryu> Hey Clemps woolieSHOOK
[5:23:50] <andimustmask> literally only time wolf shows emotion
[5:23:53] <jorniev> SHE IS COOL
[5:23:56] <+MajkirM> Hello, Clempsy boy woolieYE
[5:23:57] <andre11dr> Really?
[5:23:57] <brunoberserk> OOOF
[5:24:01] <penitentpendant> Yeah, the pop off for the first phase 2 was good
[5:24:05] <JDebss> yeah I can get that
[5:24:06] <pennykettle_> I have to beat Disco Elysium, RE4, RE7 before RE8 comes
[5:24:13] <jorniev> standing in those wires
[5:24:17] <DatAsuna> She was in the reveal trailer for a reason
[5:24:18] <andre11dr> I don't care for Lady Butterflie that much
[5:24:20] <+extantCadence> @WoolieVersus Fight the gauntlets for the special re-fights
[5:24:27] <+OblivionSword1> when is disco elysiuum again ?
[5:24:27] <wibbwobbler> Kreygasm
[5:24:28] <JDebss> I loved those wires
[5:24:28] <DatAsuna> Eh it's still super souls
[5:24:39] <pennykettle_> Lady Butterfly is really good when you have to do the spin attack to earn the health damage
[5:24:40] <Torgue_1> @OblivionSword1 End of March
[5:24:47] <+OblivionSword1> cool cool
[5:24:48] <+loukemia83> First Genichiro fight is probably the best moment, imo
[5:24:56] <jorniev> @OblivionSword1 Next week, it comes out on the 30th
[5:24:59] <VJdarkworld> we need a comparison video of woolie fighting old isshin from years ago vs. woolie fighting sword saint isshin now. MASSIVE improvement
[5:25:02] <+extantCadence> I don't really like the illusions in that fight, but it's good anyway
[5:25:32] <JDebss> It sticks with you
[5:25:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:25:36] <primaryfire> the game is also much fresher by that point
[5:25:40] <+notori_osu> @extantCadence you dont need it, but if you find snap seeds it can mitigate the illusiosn if you dont know about them already
[5:25:46] <BUDderzIllA> @VJdarkworld whut? when did he start playing this game?
[5:25:55] <+extantCadence> Genichiro in the castle is really, really strong. He's also like "the test". If you don't get it, you won't beat him.
[5:25:58] <RWLJr98> Souls-like games look exausting
[5:26:01] <pennykettle_> Dessert is boss rush I guess
[5:26:07] <Basic_Birch_> The boss rushes give you new boss versions and cool costumes
[5:26:07] <%hax_metatron> What Woolie described is what I got with Genichiro
[5:26:08] <andre11dr> Owl and Ishin is peak Fromsoft doing their thing
[5:26:08] <%ChoculaUltra> oh shit, the Jegan just dropped in Gundam Battle Operation 2
[5:26:13] <+penjaza> Try out Inner Genichiro at some point
[5:26:15] <VJdarkworld> @budderzilla On release, then he took a couple months break, then cancelled the LP till now
[5:26:17] <%hax_metatron> Genichiro is my favorite exactly for that reason
[5:26:20] <%hax_metatron> He taught me how to play
[5:26:26] <+cubbywolf> the same day my new fight stick arrives go1 tells me to use a hit box :(
[5:26:28] <%hax_metatron> At the top of the castle
[5:26:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> my favorite part about the final isshin fight is how you can really feel yourself improving on clearing genichiro and the first phase quicker and quicker
[5:26:37] <BUDderzIllA> @VJdarkworld Ooohh. Sweet that he finally finished it
[5:27:00] <Basic_Birch_> But Glock though
[5:27:06] <+extantCadence> @RWLJr98 The fourth gauntlet (which includes pretty much every boss) is probably the most exhausting thing a soulslike has to offer
[5:27:13] <andimustmask> true owl is my fave
[5:27:14] <andre11dr> I will say Nioh 2 has better combat and just more to it in general, but this has the better bosses
[5:27:26] <DatAsuna> for me it's just snake 1 and gunfort
[5:27:34] <pennykettle_> You can beat Genichiro 1 but he still beats you, which is lame
[5:27:36] <%ChoculaUltra> some of the bosses in Nioh 2 are just genuine horseshit. I'm looking at you snake poison lady thing from like chapter 2.
[5:27:36] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[5:27:38] <wibbwobbler> monke
[5:27:41] <RWLJr98> @extantCadence is it worth it? get anything good from it?
[5:27:46] <+b_aleph> But you can heal and they can't!
[5:27:56] <BUDderzIllA> NIOH, BABY
[5:27:57] <+krispen_wa> true
[5:28:00] <DatAsuna> Nioh 2 is a general improvement over 1 but I do dislike how it strips down some things like onmyo
[5:28:01] <+notori_osu> show of hands who didnt know you were supposed to jump to catch the lighting and didnt know thats what the wall scroll was trying to tell you?
[5:28:05] <+Superbro64> nioh has very few really good bosses
[5:28:09] <@Menitta> I like Nioh 2's general content a lot more. I feel like there's fun in Nioh 2 just by controlling your character. This still has more involved bosses
[5:28:13] <%KiwamiKiryu> Only the last boss does
[5:28:15] <+Superbro64> maybe tachibana, might be the only good one
[5:28:17] <+extantCadence> @RWLJr98 Nah, that one's just for bragging rights. The first three are much shorter and have rewards.
[5:28:18] <primaryfire> nioh 2 also has godlike music
[5:28:22] <marumiyan1> nioh 1 is just sloth central
[5:28:23] <rosemon5001> divine money dragon
[5:28:25] <+OblivionSword1> yeah Nioh end in not a high note
[5:28:32] <DatAsuna> Nioh's bosses are at their best when they come back slightly remixed and combo'd .etc
[5:28:32] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 2 does finally capture the boss rhythm though
[5:28:42] <andimustmask> nioh: what is jumping?
[5:28:42] <+b_aleph> Nioh 1s last boss is very lame
[5:28:47] <@Menitta> Nioh 2 has better bosses than 1 for sure
[5:28:49] <andre11dr> Like Storm King was the first flex and it's still my favorite flex
[5:28:55] <artoflec> nioh 2 has that lol
[5:28:59] <DatAsuna> Fromsoft used to do that shit without miyazaki
[5:29:04] <%KiwamiKiryu> Orochi in Nioh is close but still lame
[5:29:05] <@Menitta> I gotta finish the DLC
[5:29:09] <DatAsuna> Otogi .etc was super slick
[5:29:15] <+extantCadence> I'm still pretty early in Nioh 1 but I really haven't been impressed by any of the bosses.
[5:29:16] <vVAstrAVv> 2s bosses are dope. 1s bosses are jokes
[5:29:20] <%hax_metatron> Bloodborne has spectacle too, like Ludwig and Maria
[5:29:25] <+krispen_wa> the tenchu boss fights had all those annoying grabs
[5:29:26] <brunoberserk> boss fight in the tenchu are awful
[5:29:30] <tattleworm> oh there were total boss fights in tenchu, they just all sucked
[5:29:32] <DatAsuna> well not otogi 2 level of airtime
[5:29:40] <+b_aleph> Onryoki in 2 falls like a common foe
[5:29:41] <DatAsuna> Otogi 2 has you spending MINUTES without touching the ground
[5:29:43] <jorniev> wasn't there like a boss in nioh that uses a completely different sword fighting style thats not from japan?
[5:29:52] <tattleworm> so much so that wrath of heaven just gave you insta-kills you could charge to skip them
[5:29:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hax_metatron bro the maria fight is number 1 for me i was so hyped the whole time
[5:29:55] <jorniev> i dont remember
[5:29:58] <VJdarkworld> Boss Rush KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[5:30:00] <%Ariamis2187> my biggest disappointment with sekiro is that there was never a dlc that had a tomoe boss fight
[5:30:05] <heychaney> brote599
[5:30:06] <+Superbro64> "no" :)
[5:30:08] <+penjaza> From Software games are my favorite in general. Armored Core included
[5:30:12] <+krispen_wa> the maria fight in Nioh is real fun with a fast weapon
[5:30:13] <primaryfire> the boss rushes also have OD versions of genichiro, owl and isshin
[5:30:15] <andre11dr> Yeah Bloodborne and DS3 arw are better than Sekiro for me ,but that's not really fair to Sekiro because it's an action game
[5:30:23] <+Superbro64> you just watch, elden ring is going to be soo much worse
[5:30:25] <+krispen_wa> its just both of you dodging and weaving
[5:30:26] <%hax_metatron> There are new boss moves
[5:30:38] <Basic_Birch_> It
[5:30:41] <BUDderzIllA> @andre11dr The best action?
[5:30:44] <jorniev> @Superbro64 or worse than that... just ok
[5:30:57] <%KiwamiKiryu> yep
[5:31:02] <+cubbywolf> those people where crazy
[5:31:05] <+cubbywolf> and so are you
[5:31:05] <VJdarkworld> spear play KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[5:31:06] <+krispen_wa> BIG GUN
[5:31:12] <%KiwamiKiryu> GUN
[5:31:16] <andre11dr> GUN
[5:31:24] <+Mr_Pylon> I wanted reach in this game so bad
[5:31:24] <@Solidus_113> you can see the entire character toolset in 2 playthroughs
[5:31:27] <vVAstrAVv> just give mr nioh in sekiros world
[5:31:28] <andre11dr> GGGUUUUUUUNNNNN
[5:31:32] <artoflec> thanks nioh for setting my expectations too high for this game LUL
[5:31:37] <%hax_metatron> It's just not that game. Absolutely fair criticism, but just not that game.
[5:31:38] <+cubbywolf> but the parry system is the real weapon
[5:31:44] <+yukichocomilk> prostetics were so underwhelming
[5:31:48] <+NocturnePsycho> sekiborne: shadows shoot twice
[5:31:50] <%hax_metatron> SEKIRO 2: RPG would be sick
[5:31:53] <+OblivionSword1> Sekiro I feel was not supposed to be a soulslike game
[5:31:54] <JDebss> I still kinda wish it was Tenchu
[5:31:55] <vVAstrAVv> and with nioh 2s enemy variety
[5:31:56] <+FlubbedPig> I think the reason there were no other primary weapons is because the game's combat design was ENTIRELY designed around the deflect system.
[5:31:57] <+penjaza> I agree
[5:32:01] <jorniev> YAKUZA ISSHIN with the way more insane combat system
[5:32:06] <andre11dr> Nioh 2 is better than this, Nioh 1 uhhhh not so much
[5:32:12] <penitentpendant> They felt too much like "Mega Man Power Up" for extremely specific situations
[5:32:16] <+OblivionSword1> at least that's what I thinkä
[5:32:16] <$RayDaug> Make Spirit Emblems work like Code Vein's Ichor and Sekrio is improved by at least 50%
[5:32:21] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 1 is very much proof of concept
[5:32:24] <marumiyan1> different games, you can't compare nioh to sekiro at all imo
[5:32:24] <artoflec> i went back to nioh 1 after this game and id still take it
[5:32:33] <+taskforcebm> taskforcebm subscribed with Prime.
[5:32:34] <VJdarkworld> atleast like 2 more different weapons that are indepth as sword woulda been so hype
[5:32:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:32:46] <vVAstrAVv> well compare whatever we want
[5:32:54] <+cubbywolf> I really think woolie isnt considering how important the parry system is to the game
[5:33:04] <penitentpendant> In some ways, this game felt like someone went "YOU WILL HAVE A PARRY BUILD SO HELP ME!"
[5:33:05] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro, but you get to play as big titty waifu would be best
[5:33:19] <andre11dr> Yeah this game could've used at least 3 weapons
[5:33:19] <jorniev> grapling hook and jumping are still fucking apreciated in this game though
[5:33:23] <+cubbywolf> emblems suck hard
[5:33:25] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus I'd say Sekiro traded off weapon variety for combat depth. They put a lot more into the combat design via the Deflect system, but as a result they put all their eggs into the Sword basket.
[5:33:29] <%hax_metatron> Yeah, it's just not that game but I could imagine them doing Sekiro 2 with some more improvements
[5:33:40] <DatAsuna> They Sticker Star'd it
[5:33:41] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[5:33:43] <zocano> This game isn’t about the huge variety though and I don’t think that’s inherently a flaw— it’s purely about its parry system
[5:33:47] <%hax_metatron> WELL DONE WOOLIE
[5:33:48] <Basic_Birch_> I honestly liked the separation from Miyazaki's other games. Especially since most likely Elden Ring will be more traditional Souls
[5:33:49] <%hax_metatron> FUCK YEAH
[5:33:50] <JDebss> Well done Woolz!
[5:33:51] <VJdarkworld> end of an era
[5:33:52] <+krispen_wa> emblem is horrible. how do they figure out renewing consumables in Souls but then fuck up and go back to farming shit with sekiro
[5:33:53] <+cubbywolf> the journy is complete
[5:33:57] <vVAstrAVv> yall a parry system isnt depth come on
[5:33:58] <AShinyVagikarp> GG
[5:34:01] <jorniev> FINISH JOJO
[5:34:01] <+extantCadence> I wish Sekiro had more variance to your own moveset, even if you were stuck with the katana. Skills are cool but just having one at a time is a bit limited.
[5:34:05] <RWLJr98> @WoolieVersus whats next to not finish?
[5:34:05] <+b_aleph> Dokapon LP #2 when?
[5:34:07] <+cubbywolf> whats the next game?
[5:34:10] <%SainEdge> happy you finished it, despite the long Pause
[5:34:16] <andre11dr> I wish it was like mama in DeS where you get it back once you reach a bonfire
[5:34:19] <Basic_Birch_> Good job Well played
[5:34:22] <DatAsuna> It is funny that JFO was based on bloodborne not sekiro, yet ended up so similar
[5:34:26] <brunoberserk> so whats gonna be the next LP ?
[5:34:29] <+extantCadence> @krispen_wa but emblems are really easy to stock up on
[5:34:39] <+cubbywolf> RIP :(

[5:35:10] <+Awkward_Cyborg> great actress
[5:35:14] <DatAsuna> 80
[5:35:14] <%SainEdge> yeah she was :(

[5:35:27] <+cubbywolf> damn I loved her as Malory Archer
[5:35:28] <%jonblnt> Loose Seal
[5:35:46] <DatAsuna> Yeah probably
[5:35:52] <andre11dr> But HE MADE VIOLENT ART
[5:36:01] <andre11dr> LOOK AT BLOODBORNE
[5:36:19] <DatAsuna> A lot of off screen things
[5:36:28] <andre11dr> What is Bloodborne if not gore and violence
[5:36:29] <DatAsuna> A lot of "leave the room and we'll do thing"
[5:36:31] <zocano> Hard disagree with Sekiro lore is meh, it’s just not high fantasy
[5:36:33] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus I feel like Sekiro's production was smaller in scope, but they designed the game like it wasn't.
[5:36:47] <+OblivionSword1> Bloodborne is more horror I think
[5:36:49] <BUDderzIllA> Whuz that? Is it BLUD? jaboodyS
[5:36:51] <zocano> There’s a weird spiritual animalism to it
[5:36:56] <DatAsuna> @zocano I would say the sheer amount of explicit magic makes it high fantasy
[5:36:58] <Basic_Birch_> @zocano same
[5:37:08] <@Menitta> A lot of the story feels like nothing more than a vehicle for these different areas
[5:37:11] <%hax_metatron> @andre11dr Exactly, he's talking about feeling diminished because he makes violent art (All Souls games are violent)
[5:37:16] <%hax_metatron> I think the sculptor comes from that
[5:37:32] <+krispen_wa> what if elden Ring is actually a pacifist game
[5:37:44] <artoflec> im def fine with story as a vehicle to go and do cool stuff but even for that i just stopped caring about what people were saying lol
[5:37:45] <DatAsuna> I don't think the scultpr story really lands because of the miyazaki style
[5:37:54] <zocano> @datasuna ya sorry as soon as I said it I realized it wasn’t the right word
[5:38:02] <andre11dr> Okami goes to the point
[5:38:06] <@Solidus_113> red/blue oni, 9 Tails
[5:38:10] <RWLJr98> Elden Ring is just a placeholder name for Armored Core
[5:38:20] <+krispen_wa> ROMANCE?
[5:38:23] <+OblivionSword1> Nobunaga in China ?
[5:38:24] <+shadehoup> finding out that Elden Ring was also in production made a lot of sense for how small Sekiro feels
[5:38:24] <+krispen_wa> DIFFERENT LORE
[5:38:24] <penitentpendant> Wait... Romance is from china
[5:38:25] <+b_aleph> That's not China
[5:38:27] <+FlubbedPig> Sekiro kinda suffers in that having an actual straight plot make it's less folklore than the other Souls games.

[5:39:23] <andimustmask> nioh 2 does get to play around with i quite a bit since you're not tied to a historical figure like william/anjin
[5:39:24] <%hax_metatron> Yeah I want Sekiro 2 to just lean more into Senpou Temple / Fountainhead lore
[5:39:27] <+FlubbedPig> I really wish Sekiro had taken place in a Japan-themed fantasy land rather than literally JUST Japan.

[5:41:03] <Basic_Birch_> Sauron is my favorite sekiro character
[5:41:05] <andre11dr> @zocano I don't know, you spend a lot of time fighting regular dude and Samurai than evil oni and shit like that ,definitely more than in Dark Souls and Bloodborne where your not always fighting humans
[5:41:12] <%ChoculaUltra> oh damn, is that a Capri Sun?!
[5:41:12] <+yukichocomilk> sometimes that just happens
[5:41:14] <vVAstrAVv> the black sword is a gate basically
[5:41:15] <RWLJr98> thanks brave king @Solidus_113
[5:41:18] <penitentpendant> Become what you must, Woolie! BECOME... NORMAL COP!
[5:41:23] <+penjaza> I mean, they give you a hint
[5:41:25] <%AyotoCorp> There's an item pickup
[5:41:28] <%AyotoCorp> Which tells you
[5:41:32] <+FlubbedPig> The scroll you found last stream says the Black Mortal Blade opens a way into the Underworld. He pulled Isshin's soul back into the world.
[5:41:33] <+extantCadence> The black mortal blade let Genichiro summon him
[5:41:38] <+Superbro64> capri sun Pog
[5:41:38] <%ChoculaUltra> @WoolieVersus minh what are you drinking I need to know
[5:41:41] <@Menitta> hell yeah capri sun
[5:41:43] <%SainEdge> @WoolieVersus Genichiro uses the black mortal blade, which "opens the gate to the underworld"
[5:41:47] <+FrostedZaibatsu> The swords opens a portal, the entrence was his neck
[5:41:51] <+shadehoup> Isshin is cool but yeah him as boss is thin
[5:42:04] <@Menitta> man now all I can think about is Yakuza Ishin and how much I want it
[5:42:06] <+shadehoup> "there's ANOTHER mortal blade yeah"
[5:42:28] <penitentpendant> Excalibur, the western mortal blade
[5:42:35] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[5:42:41] <+FlubbedPig> You CAN'T be Shura!
[5:42:53] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus he used the black mortal blade on himself. the black blade is specifically tied to the underworld. The implication is that when a mortal blade cuts, its cutting an opening into the underworld itself which is why it does damage to the immortal. this portal was used to summon his grandfather from the underworld where he had been sainted as a sword saint
[5:42:57] <+penjaza> I wouldn't call it too similar to souls
[5:42:58] <RWLJr98> Will Sekiro journey to America after Sekiro 2 Kappa
[5:43:01] <andimustmask> to be fair, the second mortal blade is established pretty quickly, since owl has it
[5:43:09] <+FlubbedPig> Sekiro is weird. It almost feels like if Miyazaki's name wasn't attached it wouldn't be considered Souls.
[5:43:10] <+b_aleph> Armored Core VI coming out never
[5:43:13] <andimustmask> genichiro just grabbed it off his corpse
[5:43:19] <andre11dr> I want Armoured Core back

[5:43:29] <andre11dr> Souls Cored
[5:43:30] <DatAsuna> please dear god fdon't turn armoured core into a miytazaki game
[5:43:32] <%ekodrop> after armored core v, armored core vi should never happen

[5:47:43] <+FlubbedPig> @andre11dr I agree, but I specifically don't want to be actual Hindu like how Sekiro was JUST Japan. I want new settings, just with visual styles outside of Europe.
