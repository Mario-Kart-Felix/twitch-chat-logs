[0:10:16] <%AvroEltz> arcade has routes, hardest one gives you a fucker of a nago fight
[0:10:18] <Lunocura> Nago but he laughs in the face of people who call him low tier

[0:10:35] <%Shad0wTag> Hey Woolie I wanna say thank you for getting me into GG. It was lore that made and content that made commit to an FG for the first time in years. Also don't worry about not being able to finish the lore series before Strive could come out. Strive has a GREAT glossary and timeline which totally filled in the gaps for me and is super helpful!

[0:11:36] <%Moiseivitch> Woolie how is your back, king
[0:11:42] <+yusefHD> Did you see the DJ Kay Slay video that just dropped? He has a 40 minute cypher with 110 rappers. Fucking insanity, there are no breaks LUL It's an oldhead paradise tbh.
[0:11:43] <More_Onn> Watch out for those Sol slashes
[0:11:45] <%Shad0wTag> @zashzila Yeah he is doing better

[0:12:06] <%zeroarturia> oh shit.
[0:12:11] <andre11dr> Wow nothing?
[0:12:12] <Vaunno> @jepupu protip: if you lose a round, throw the second and rematch that stage, the game wont count the losses :)

[0:12:37] <lemon_lover28> Yeah the Xrd glossary was massive
[0:12:38] <CupsCommander> It's still huge tho
[0:12:38] <%zeroarturia> I feel some story elements are missing too.
[0:12:42] <%Irridium> Kept in womanhood LUL

[0:13:30] <Lunocura> @AvroEltz darn, it's worthless then

[0:13:37] <leith_aziz> Without spoiling
[0:13:41] <kikoeru_san> like the Chipp kingdom
[0:13:50] <%hologram_sam> the details you included in the vids really made the GGST story better for me
[0:13:51] <leith_aziz> Also Sol got a nice ending
[0:13:59] <%X2Eliah> So in the last video, the epilogue about some dudes eating a demon pudding and farting up into the sky, what was the relevance of that?
[0:14:01] <%servicesuspension> woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[0:14:06] <leith_aziz> Yep. Deliah was mentioned by Anji I think
[0:14:07] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Congratulations to you for finishing your homework, Woolie
[0:14:12] <Mnemonicjohnny> I actually really dig this "making of" stuff
[0:14:24] <Sonicdy> Axl got good ending too
[0:14:30] <+Arnschen> Yeah lol
[0:14:37] <%jolene_orenji> @X2Eliah it's actually super important for the strive story. Those farts were actually information spikes from the Backyard
[0:14:37] <MBDiana1> tonight, on guilty bottom gear: sol rides his wife, ky gets a nice eye, and ramlethal eats a burger
[0:14:41] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah I think that might not be cannon now that I think of it since Daryl's fine in Strive
[0:14:43] <+TheMainManAfrika> ERICA Kreygasm
[0:14:45] <Lunocura> Woolie's videos should come packaged with Strive
[0:14:50] <%Moiseivitch> Do you think Zappa will ever be playable again, i miss him
[0:14:56] <%hologram_sam> @lunocura facts
[0:14:58] <leith_aziz> Also I finally like I-No now
[0:15:01] <%zeroarturia> The lore videos really helped out
[0:15:07] <leith_aziz> She's pretty cool now and I finally got her motive
[0:15:07] <Lunocura> @Moiseivitch I don't.
[0:15:07] <fishstick545> does it look like we might get gabriel as dlc?
[0:15:08] <%Shad0wTag> I wanna believe the GG timeline in Strive is inspired by Woolie's videos
[0:15:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> i did
[0:15:16] <theredfox930000> ino from capital one
[0:15:21] <%Moiseivitch> @Moiseivitch :(
[0:15:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it was really nice to know who the fuck was who
[0:15:24] <lemon_lover28> what lore series is this? fighterpedia?
[0:15:27] <DSD24> Zappa was the cool upside down man right?
[0:15:30] <DaKnightWarrior> You did a fantastic job.
[0:15:31] <+alphonseisbest> WE doing story today?!111
[0:15:36] <%zeroarturia> @moiseivitch doubt it due to not being possessed anymore.
[0:15:39] <Lunocura> @lemon_lover28 Woolie did a cool lore series
[0:15:44] <%Moiseivitch> @DSD24 correct
[0:15:46] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 Yes. He had a Stand if you got all the ghosts
[0:15:52] <%Shad0wTag> @fishstick545 The datamine potential list I don't think mentioned it
[0:15:53] <Vaunno> these character themes and their lyrics, man...
[0:15:54] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> WHO IS BEDMAN?
[0:15:56] <Sonicdy> But when lore spoilercast Kappa
[0:16:00] <andre11dr> That happened with Raven where everyone was like " Who tf is this" but he was around in the story for like years
[0:16:03] <%hologram_sam> the 4.5 hours whip by tho
[0:16:10] <%Shad0wTag> @dsd24 Yup he is mostly better
[0:16:12] <Vaunno> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke man in bed :)
[0:16:13] <DSD24> @Moiseivitch @leith_aziz Thank you both!
[0:16:13] <Agami23> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke a man strapped to a bed.
[0:16:16] <+slaughterpuff> About as long as synder cut but 8times as intresting
[0:16:29] <%jolene_orenji> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke some guy who thinks super hard and has to sleep because if he was awake he would literally blow up from thinking
[0:16:33] <%Irridium> release the Woolie Cut
[0:16:40] <%zeroarturia> @slaughterpuff I second that opinion
[0:16:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> totsugeki will end the world
[0:16:47] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> damn thx @jolene_orenji
[0:16:48] <leith_aziz> Script wise, I think this might be the most well made one yet. Though its still GG of course
[0:16:48] <Lunocura> Arcade I think is super barebones
[0:16:49] <%X2Eliah> Woolie's GG lore video series are basically a really good short anime season
[0:16:49] <NotHereToStream> do arcade hard mode
[0:16:49] <kikoeru_san> Can we talk about Stage 9 Nago
[0:16:52] <@Solidus_113> PS5 version?
[0:16:54] <andre11dr> There are some people in that story that i really hope they add later
[0:16:56] <+yusefHD> @Irridium What are we, some kind of "suicide squad?"
[0:16:56] <%crumbles93> crumbles93 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:16:57] <leith_aziz> I do wish Arcade was more developed
[0:16:58] <kikoeru_san> the evil
[0:17:03] <leith_aziz> I really liked the Episdoes
[0:17:03] <MBDiana1> guilty gear lore goes harder than any other fighter and I'm happy arcsys is proud about it
[0:17:06] <leith_aziz> *Episodes
[0:17:15] <%Th3rd3> feels like vanilla Sign
[0:17:27] <dustworthmain> get to stage 9 with no rounds lost
[0:17:29] <leith_aziz> You cant lose any rounds
[0:17:29] <andre11dr> Wait which version is this ?
[0:17:32] <kikoeru_san> He is insane Woolie, he's only on Extreme
[0:17:35] <+yusefHD> VENOM PogChamp
[0:17:38] <+Fiiib> To get to stage 9 you need to win every fight 2-0 even stage 8
[0:17:40] <DaKnightWarrior> He's nuts. I love it.
[0:17:42] <+CuppaJo3> You'd know if you did lol
[0:17:43] <+Arnschen> Stage 9 Nago NotLikeThis
[0:17:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[0:17:43] <DSD24> Akashic Nago
[0:17:50] <Vaunno> @WoolieVersus if you rematch it doesnt count rounds lost
[0:17:52] <kikoeru_san> Once you get to Stage 8nyou get Stage 9
[0:17:52] <leith_aziz> If you lose a round, lose the match and rematch
[0:17:53] <Zombrocom> You have to beat super nago alone with losing a round to get ultra mega nago
[0:17:55] <leith_aziz> It wont count
[0:17:55] <$Noponis> Win both rounds : Stage 8 is solo. BEat him double rounded : stage 9 nago @WoolieVersus
[0:17:58] <Lunocura> Woolie just leaked Venom as Season 1 DLC Stream
[0:18:03] <WakeUpThrow> I got insanely hype for a second, I need my Venom fix
[0:18:03] <%X2Eliah> are the servers down?
[0:18:04] <LorcaNomad> you can rematch too
[0:18:06] <+yusefHD> LUL
[0:18:06] <%X2Eliah> yo
[0:18:06] <kikoeru_san> you can take all the tries on stage 8
[0:18:07] <Sonicdy> If you lose a round, you need to rematch
[0:18:10] <+SeventhVice> Utilizing the PS5 card system, you can get to training mode in 10 seconds after seeing the arcsys logo, opposed to 2 minutes of normal loading
[0:18:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though you can scum it out by rematching instead of continuing
[0:18:14] <+alphonseisbest> so whats the plan today? wools
[0:18:16] <leith_aziz> Hard mode is also very cool
[0:18:17] <dustworthmain> stage 8 is tough but you can lose and rematch instead of starting over @WoolieVersus
[0:18:19] <+Fiiib> Stage 9 nago is in blood rage all the time but can still use his specials and no health loss NotLikeThis
[0:18:22] <leith_aziz> Can we do Hard mode instead?
[0:18:24] <kikoeru_san> Stage 9 is infinite Blood Mode
[0:18:25] <+slaughterpuff> I haven't even attempted stage 9 nago yet. gonna do it soon but seems like its gonna suck
[0:18:26] <+CuppaJo3> It's brutal\
[0:18:28] <+Arnschen> Nah, it always just takes a long time to start up Strive
[0:18:30] <+yusefHD> @Fiiib brutal
[0:18:35] <Zombrocom> Stage 9 is "Get fucked"
[0:18:36] <$Noponis> stage 9 nago took me several hours of non stop trying lol
[0:18:38] <Darren716> No sound?
[0:18:39] <leith_aziz> There are ways to cheese Nago with Sol and Anji
[0:18:39] <%jepupu> GG Strive login speedrum any%, per time 3 mins.
[0:18:45] <andre11dr> Isn't the DLC already leaked
[0:18:46] <%Shad0wTag> Reggie about to show his secret tech
[0:18:47] <Lunocura> Strive Loading Screen is my favorite podcast
[0:18:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE MILLIA
[0:18:50] <%jinking79> Grab the shit out of the Ai
[0:18:52] <%Afterman_> sol is fun AF
[0:18:54] <leith_aziz> With Sol, knock Nago down and do air DP
[0:18:56] <dustworthmain> took me just under 100 tries to beat stage 9 nago
[0:18:58] <lvl10cybermancer> Axl fun as hell
[0:18:58] <@Menitta> I really hope I can get a match this stream. I;ve been putting a ton of time into Millia
[0:18:59] <MBDiana1> turns out if nago didn't have a suicide button, then he would be scary
[0:18:59] <%jepupu> Par time*
[0:19:00] <kikoeru_san> also he get invincibility on start up on most moves
[0:19:00] <%Shad0wTag> oh god lord not axl
[0:19:03] <Agami23> god i hate fighting millia.
[0:19:07] <caprademonv2> I did stage 8 with about 48 attempts and still haven't won
[0:19:08] <Mnemonicjohnny> Axl's aces, man, whatchu talkin bout
[0:19:16] <caprademonv2> fun time
[0:19:21] <%saladin1911> Millia is a nightmare for me to fight against ngl
[0:19:22] <%Broand> Axl is fun times
[0:19:24] <%zeroarturia> Extreme Nago is SNK Boss syndrome
[0:19:31] <ECRead> stage 9 took me over 70 attempts with Pot. Pot buster does as much to the health bar as a f.S does normally.
[0:19:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> nago has a forbidden super dash
[0:19:33] <+slaughterpuff> axel is great. But man everytime i play him ram's just wreck my shit
[0:19:34] <leith_aziz> Nago was buffed in release, I should say
[0:19:34] <joshua_42> Is this the PC or console version?
[0:19:35] <BackwardCap> Absorb Tech
[0:19:36] <TheChapyGuy> I actually made it into heaven on the first week. I really didn't expect to do that, but Nago is a beast once you learn him
[0:19:37] <%jinking79> some of his moves hits behind him too
[0:19:37] <@Menitta> Where is everyone at floor wise
[0:19:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> that literally gives him forward momentum
[0:19:40] <leith_aziz> @joshua_42 PS Store, so PS
[0:19:43] <%hologram_sam> he got second to hookganggod
[0:19:43] <Zombrocom> BTW, woolie on PS5 or PC
[0:19:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kizzie is putting in work
[0:19:47] <%Irridium> @Menitta heaven
[0:19:49] <kikoeru_san> I did Stage 9 for hours, like 200+ tries, you have to cheese him
[0:19:49] <@Solidus_113> this looks PS5
[0:19:51] <%X2Eliah> ps5

[0:20:47] <TheChapyGuy> @Menitta I'm made it to celestial floor, and I'm actually in the top 200 Nagos last I looked on PC. might've dropped because I haven't been playing much
[0:20:48] <kikoeru_san> MR DOLPHIN
[0:20:48] <DaKnightWarrior> T WutFaceTSUGEKI
[0:20:51] <%justmildlilac> I've TOUCHED floor 8. Still gotta earn a solid spot for me there
[0:20:52] <+Shishi1205> It seems like Nago is pretty good actually
[0:20:53] <+zuzuxiv> This is my first fighting game and I'm playing I-no is that a bad idea LOL
[0:20:57] <%Irridium> assuming may just spams that dophin it does have counters. The problem is if the may is actually smart and catches you punishing then mixes it up
[0:20:58] <+zuzuxiv> I really enjoy her moveset
[0:21:00] <lvl10cybermancer> Nago is legit high tier
[0:21:02] <+Arnschen> Nago has mad pressure tho
[0:21:05] <@Menitta> @TheChapyGuy Holy shit good job!
[0:21:06] <+Shishi1205> I've seen some nasty shit
[0:21:06] <Saltmeisterr> nah Nago's been pretty good
[0:21:07] <%zanz_san> Too much car crap happened for me to buy this.
[0:21:09] <Zombrocom> Nago is strong but has some REALLY hard matchups
[0:21:11] <+Sillypeacock> Well in all fairness, nobody gets IN on Axel
[0:21:14] <leith_aziz> @zuzuxiv Play who you like. You'll get good.
[0:21:17] <lvl10cybermancer> Nago is actually really solid against Axl too because of his super jump and gap close
[0:21:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:21:20] <@Menitta> I feel okay fighting against Nago as Millia
[0:21:21] <Saltmeisterr> Fame's Nago is very goof
[0:21:22] <+Mrthefro> Potemkin vs Axl made me physically tired.
[0:21:23] <TJ_Timbs> @zuzuxiv she's pretty good. play who you like anyway
[0:21:25] <andre11dr> A lot of people are saying that Nago is really good
[0:21:26] <+Strahlenwaffeln> @zuzuxiv you never knew how to dash normaly so its no deal^^
[0:21:28] <Lunocura> Nago seems good, people just didn't like that he needs labbing
[0:21:29] <NotHereToStream> nago's pressue makes me think that super cancer was a necessary evil for him
[0:21:30] <FatherFauna> Nago has been developed since the betas and received some nice changes
[0:21:31] <leith_aziz> Nago has stuff that makes him good now
[0:21:32] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> !main
[0:21:37] <leith_aziz> 214H is 0 on block
[0:21:39] <BwdYeti> Nago doesn't actually want to get in, his worst time is when he's being pressured
[0:21:43] <leith_aziz> It makes his pressure strong
[0:21:45] <BwdYeti> he's a spacing character
[0:21:46] <Dave_VD> This is definitely the strongest he's been
[0:21:46] <Mnemonicjohnny> @WoolieVersus Yo, you seen the new Nago tech? RCing his 214H basically gives him a fullscreen shorthop
[0:21:46] <%X2Eliah> Nowadays ppl say that Nago can get super good
[0:21:48] <dustworthmain> Nago beats potemkin im pretty sure. ha can't get in
[0:21:51] <Vaunno> took me so long to realize blood buffs your range AND frame data
[0:21:56] <%Shad0wTag> I overlooked Nago in the past but as Pot main I have to respect him more than I thought I would
[0:21:59] <+yeknomlive> @leith_aziz that's the spin move right? it's plus if it's far too
[0:21:59] <%nakunattakage> @justmildlilac thanks for the gifted sub dude! I appreciate it!
[0:22:06] <%dds333a> As you'd expect.
[0:22:06] <%Moiseivitch> Re: Pot vs Axel Pot main here, Axels love using their ground special and mixing it up with the command grab. You can actually flick the projectile back.
[0:22:07] <morow1ec> defensive nago is super strong
[0:22:07] <OfficerMods> we public park boyz?
[0:22:09] <andre11dr> Also Nago has probably some of the best normals in the game
[0:22:11] <%Moiseivitch> And you can megafist punish the grab
[0:22:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> faust is suffering but i love the gameplay
[0:22:16] <%Shad0wTag> @dustworthmain As Pot main on higher floor it definitely takes me more skill
[0:22:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im not following the game that closely but i almost never hear people mention faust is there a reason for that?
[0:22:21] <leith_aziz> @yeknomlive Usually, they mix between either grab or backdash to bait a punish. its scary
[0:22:26] <ChortlesJ1> @WoolieVersus Watching GGL Heaven or Hell finale RIGHT NOW, are you doing Strive story later down the road?
[0:22:27] <%jinking79> last i saw Nago player was #1 Rank
[0:22:28] <%justmildlilac> @nakunattakage Hell ye, hope you enjoy it woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:22:28] <emptyantics> Nago has a shitton of safe pokes and normals
[0:22:33] <CupsCommander> 214H PRC is a metered way to get in with Nago
[0:22:37] <leith_aziz> Management
[0:22:38] <+atmosqortz> Wouldn't he be a chore character?
[0:22:40] <%the_Punktuation> Venom Mechanic.
[0:22:40] <DSD24> State characters?
[0:22:41] <leith_aziz> Meter manage,enmt
[0:22:42] <$Noponis> resource management
[0:22:42] <%Shad0wTag> @cobalt_phoenix_ He is too random basically and not a reliable pick against alot of match uos
[0:22:43] <Lunocura> Ammo Characters?
[0:22:44] <Zombrocom> Does woolie know nagos normals get stronger the higher his blood goes?
[0:22:45] <%jolene_orenji> call 'em fulgores
[0:22:46] <Saltmeisterr> resource Management
[0:22:47] <jKazej> I hope Woolie knows, but Nago's normals get better when he's on level 2 blood gauge
[0:22:48] <%dds333a> @cobalt_phoenix_ he has his days jn the limelight, it just depends
[0:22:51] <+Fiiib> overheat mechanic
[0:22:51] <@Solidus_113> ABA has it
[0:22:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @cobalt_phoenix_ he could be better tbh
[0:22:54] <%the_Punktuation> Same as Bane from Injustice
[0:22:55] <andre11dr> Like ABA and Rbo Ky
[0:22:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Shad0wTag ah
[0:22:56] <Saltmeisterr> Elliana
[0:22:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> extra cooldown or cool up meter
[0:22:59] <emptyantics> Overheat mechanic
[0:23:01] <%the_Punktuation> Venom Management.
[0:23:10] <leith_aziz> Sin, Robo Ky and ABA
[0:23:12] <+yeknomlive> also to help get in nago's dash has upper body invincibility i think? just saw a clip showing it
[0:23:12] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:23:13] <+kumaprime> I wanna make Nago my secondary character
[0:23:17] <captain_dinglepants> what the hell was that?!
[0:23:21] <Zuzu_Pachulia> monkaS
[0:23:23] <%Shad0wTag> @moiseivitch wait for real we can flick it back?
[0:23:31] <Saltmeisterr> @yeknomlive ye it does
[0:23:31] <leith_aziz> Let's listen to thoe themes!

[0:24:04] <%TheotherKristian> RET'S LOCK!!!
[0:24:04] <NotHereToStream> i heard that nago's second blood gauge makes his normal faster or something
[0:24:10] <leith_aziz> That was a placeholder
[0:24:10] <CryptusMaximus> @AngryPhant0m I mean Woolie and Reg are pretty black
[0:24:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the alt colors in this are few but they are nice

[0:24:45] <%Irridium> one thing I don't like is that non-strive music is mixed lower in volume. Some songs you can't even hear in fights
[0:24:46] <+Shishi1205> Lore only player
[0:24:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> Woolie hasnt been able to play because of the back problems

[0:26:01] <blastazoid00> Scrublord's Cut
[0:26:02] <TheChapyGuy> I'm a 10 boy
[0:26:03] <MBDiana1> nago has some drip
[0:26:04] <Saltmeisterr> JAGORIYUKI
[0:26:04] <MasoCheeseStick> @cobalt_phoenix_ He has lost a lot of his safety in his weird hitbox on top of losing FD cancel which faust abused to no end due to how his hitbox shrank in j.FD and being able to cancel drill, his pressure overall is a lot lower. he can also barely get anything going out any defensive hits combine that with most of his normals being unsafe he just struggles
[0:26:05] <DSD24> I don't like the glowing fingers
[0:26:09] <DaKnightWarrior> Here we go.
[0:26:10] <%servicesuspension> Woolie's Lore Videos are the true canon

[0:27:45] <Mnemonicjohnny> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Mid-high, if you can manage blood well.
[0:27:45] <TheChapyGuy> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke VERY good, he just takes a bit to learn

[0:27:46] <CruxAustralis> OOOH LULLABY
[0:27:47] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> bet im getting this game soon
[0:27:48] <KaiGoesMoo> Nago's damage makes you HAVE to respect him at all times and I really like that
[0:27:49] <Halospaz117> I'll be honest, my favorite Strive theme is whatever I listened to last, they're all so damn good
[0:27:49] <+Shishi1205> that one is super good
[0:27:52] <%dds333a> @saladin1911 Akihiko had something like that too
[0:28:00] <leith_aziz> SOOOO CAAAARYYYY OOOOOONNNN
[0:28:01] <Vaunno> SOOO CARRY OOOON
[0:28:02] <odd_slater> SOOOOOO CARRY ON
[0:28:05] <+natedrago> WHAY
[0:28:06] <+sandwichtaker> Nagos heavy slash gets bigger the more bars of blood rage you have
[0:28:06] <leith_aziz> LOVE THE SUBHUMAN SELF
[0:28:07] <+Arnschen> LOVE THE SUBHUMAN SELF
[0:28:07] <+alphonseisbest> LOVE THE SUB HUMAN SELF
[0:28:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @GenesisKnight

[0:28:13] <CruxAustralis> SOOOOO CARRY ON
[0:28:15] <dustworthmain> Millia dies in 3 hits tops once you get a hang of him
[0:28:16] <Vaunno> chat karaoke
[0:28:18] <@Menitta> SOOOOOO CARRY ON
[0:28:24] <%jolene_orenji> @Irridium that dude looked like he was doing one of those TAS speedruns where they input the code to the game with the controller and STILL SOMEHOW LOST
[0:28:25] <leith_aziz> pengJam
[0:28:25] <VJdarkworld> KomodoHype
[0:28:28] <@Menitta> Millia's theme is EASILY my fucking favorite
[0:28:30] <@Menitta> Its SO GOOD
[0:28:30] <Vaunno> PepeD
[0:28:31] <DaKnightWarrior> SingsNote CoolCat SingsNote
[0:28:31] <Agami23> isnt it rad?
[0:28:32] <TheChapyGuy> Millia's theme is a banger
[0:28:32] <Halospaz117> ITS SOO GOOD WOOLZ
[0:28:33] <Daniel_Is_I> It's a GOOD-ASS SONG
[0:28:34] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> nago is a BIG NUMBER character?
[0:28:36] <+Arnschen> It's great Woolz
[0:28:36] <lvl10cybermancer> Was Axl's theme in the beta?
[0:28:37] <%saladin1911> @dds333a P4A? Man, I never got to play it. 100% needs a sequel
[0:28:37] <KaiGoesMoo> Oh man I love that we get to see Woolie's reaction to all the music
[0:28:38] <leith_aziz> Strive's OST amazing
[0:28:38] <caprademonv2> I really like nago but I'm so bad at doing the bite
[0:28:39] <@Solidus_113> Rock Parade is my favourite
[0:28:40] <MasoCheeseStick> Faust is still pretty good if you put a lot of hours into him, but similarly to how Baiken worked in xrd you don't get a lot of out of him
[0:28:43] <Zombrocom> We need to make woolie hear Roar of the Spark
[0:28:45] <@Solidus_113> Anji's theme
[0:28:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> didn't even listen to the songs on youtube? dam
[0:28:45] <roz_en> Yeah this ost FUCKS
[0:28:47] <+PR0swagonist> that means he hasnt heard May's theme yet
[0:28:49] <+natedrago> OST listening session?
[0:28:50] <%kewlmyc> Strive has a lot of butt rock, but Subhuman Self is a legit good song
[0:28:51] <pixel_river> SourPls
[0:28:52] <+GelatinBoi> tfw picking characters to learn based on their theme song
[0:28:53] <leith_aziz> @MasoCheeseStick A lot of people think Faust is low tier.
[0:28:54] <%MrKerb> Counters are so cool
[0:28:55] <+snickers_md> Bazinga Parade
[0:29:01] <%dds333a> @greenherbwhitesmoke he can be
[0:29:02] <Daniel_Is_I> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Kinda. He's deliberate and you murder someone if you get 'em with a blood burst
[0:29:03] <emptyantics> CoolCat SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[0:29:05] <SQDizzy> it's good butt rock though
[0:29:06] <Vaunno> all of the cool content creators are doing rate-the-ost streams :)
[0:29:06] <ullyzeez> bruh i thought woolie wad a GG fan?? and he didnt touch the game? smh
[0:29:07] <Jaysky> I like Nago's theme probably the most behind the main theme
[0:29:08] <+Shishi1205> Positive bonus
[0:29:08] <KaiGoesMoo> @caprademonv2 I struggled with it too
[0:29:08] <lvl10cybermancer> Pot theme is legitimately amazing
[0:29:09] <%AnbeiH> ive basically just had the OST on repeat all week
[0:29:09] <+TopTieramisu> yo
[0:29:10] <VJdarkworld> RC combo POG
[0:29:10] <+sherlockholmeboy> Has he listened to Crawl yet?
[0:29:11] <Saltmeisterr> @Solidus_113 B a z i n g a
[0:29:13] <+Fiiib> yo woolie got them combos
[0:29:15] <freddyl0c0> the mindgames
[0:29:17] <MasoCheeseStick> @MasoCheeseStick he is, playing one match against Ram or Gio really shows how hard he struggles
[0:29:17] <leith_aziz> Nago got buffed
[0:29:18] <Zombrocom> Got the frame trap
[0:29:19] <+yeknomlive> i play faust and he has a lot of bad design choices
[0:29:19] <leith_aziz> He's good
[0:29:19] <emptyantics> DAMN
[0:29:19] <%dds333a> @ullyzeez LUL LUL
[0:29:20] <cheap_turbo> woolie doing rust work
[0:29:22] <%Shad0wTag> Millia's theme is one of the best in the game. Who knew GG benefitted from female vocals? Based Arc Sys and Daisuke
[0:29:23] <theredfox930000> put reggie in a body bag tstyNoise tstyNoise
[0:29:24] <Sonicdy> The character theme is all good imo
[0:29:25] <+YawnSong_> Entire sound track is top tier
[0:29:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Guilty Gear music always hits different.
[0:29:32] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag That was a great choice
[0:29:33] <Josef_Stryker> Oh neat they fixed that subtitle
[0:29:36] <+The_Death_Owl> @ullyzeez he had an injured back and was focused on getting the lore vids out
[0:29:41] <+MugenSandan> Just curious is Woolie in the park or the tower?
[0:29:44] <TheChapyGuy> Nago is so fun
[0:29:48] <+Generalbrwni> Requiem gotta be my favorite from the OST so far, I think Millia's theme is probably my second though
[0:29:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> i do want more story on wtf happened to faust in this game
[0:29:49] <NotHereToStream> offline
[0:29:51] <$Noponis> woolie is offline vs reggie
[0:29:52] <leith_aziz> I was worried Nago might end up a jobber like a lot of new FG faces. I was gladly wrong
[0:29:52] <+justianxix> woolie has still yet to play the story mode right?
[0:29:53] <Vaunno> all subs match the english lines now, at the very least
[0:29:55] <%Shad0wTag> Millia's theme is one of the best in the game. Who knew GG benefitted from female vocals? Based Arc Sys and Daisuke
[0:29:58] <leith_aziz> @justianxix He has
[0:29:59] <%X2Eliah> @MugenSandan woolie said he will go to park in like 2 hrs
[0:29:59] <+snickers_md> It reminds me of whats her names theme from MGR
[0:29:59] <MasoCheeseStick> Faust is still my favorite character though and I won't drop him unless the DLC characters offer something
[0:29:59] <+Arnschen> @MugenSandan Just VS. rn, said he'll go to the park later on
[0:30:00] <%AnbeiH> anji is bae, i live and die by rock parade
[0:30:07] <leith_aziz> @snickers_md Mistral
[0:30:09] <+Shishi1205> you gotta learn the super jump tech woolie, that makes some matchups better for Nago
[0:30:14] <+slaughterpuff> man they do gio dirty in story. she gets like a fight
[0:30:15] <%jepupu> I kind of miss Danger Time. But only as a spectator
[0:30:19] <+snickers_md> @snickers_md Yeah thats the one
[0:30:19] <+MugenSandan> Damn Reggie is able to keep pretty calm to keep talking then lol
[0:30:21] <Sandofvitch> Damn that mix
[0:30:27] <%Moiseivitch> If zappa never comes back i plan to pocket happy chaos
[0:30:30] <leith_aziz> @slaughterpuff Well. lets hope for more in the Story DLC
[0:30:30] <CruxAustralis> OOOOOOH LULLABY
[0:30:32] <%Moiseivitch> Hes the joker baby
[0:30:36] <@Menitta> god this Millia might be my favorite fighting game character now
[0:30:36] <+yeknomlive> same. im sticking with faust cause he's still just too fun
[0:30:37] <+justianxix> @leith_aziz. he has? I was hoping to catch him watching it on a stream
[0:30:38] <@Menitta> Her design
[0:30:41] <gunstars20> Da Boi woolie
[0:30:42] <@Menitta> is just so fucking good
[0:30:42] <%dds333a> @jepupu totally agree, boy is it annoying to be on the other end
[0:30:42] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus sooooo ... when's you gonna do the nagoryuki cosplay ?? dnoGEESE
[0:30:42] <CruxAustralis> SO CARRY ON
[0:30:43] <+Shishi1205> SO CARRY ON
[0:30:47] <leith_aziz> @justianxix He did
[0:30:48] <CruxAustralis> LOVE THE SUBHUMAN SELF
[0:30:51] <lvl10cybermancer> God that anti-air is so godlike
[0:30:57] <Saltmeisterr> @Moiseivitch he's LITERALLY the joker
[0:30:59] <MasoCheeseStick> Nage, nemo and other faust players are still finding weird stuff to do with his MixMixMix though, so he could still be stronger than people think
[0:31:01] <%egressanon> JAB CENTRAL
[0:31:01] <leith_aziz> Also Leo's theme is depressing once you get the lyrics
[0:31:04] <+alphonseisbest> LOVE THE SUB HUMAN SELF
[0:31:05] <leith_aziz> Like, damn
[0:31:06] <andre11dr> I can't believe that color, it looks like they made it with Woolie in mind
[0:31:09] <@Menitta> oooh Tandem into PRC
[0:31:13] <Vaunno> nago 2HS is the most satisfying move in existence, ESPECIALLY on counterhit
[0:31:14] <+alphonseisbest> THIS THEME IS KILLER
[0:31:15] <leith_aziz> Shit
[0:31:16] <Daniel_Is_I> I've been rocking Gio. She's so aggressive, I love it.
[0:31:17] <leith_aziz> wth?
[0:31:17] <+TopTieramisu> oof
[0:31:18] <@Menitta> niiiiice
[0:31:18] <NotHereToStream> t
[0:31:19] <+FuqBoiSlim> NOOOO
[0:31:20] <caprademonv2> are chip and Anji really hard to go against? my friends play them against me and just can't figure out what to do. but they also played a lot more fighting games than me so I don't know
[0:31:21] <%dds333a> Ouch
[0:31:31] <%kewlmyc> I've never seen someone use Blood Rage, then NOT die 2 seconds later
[0:31:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> schmovement
[0:31:41] <leith_aziz> @caprademonv2 Chipp is all about being tricky and moving everywhere
[0:31:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REGGIE GANG
[0:31:42] <%dds333a> She's been consistently good
[0:31:44] <%jolene_orenji> I still have no idea what to do against millia with that spinning hair projectile thingy
[0:31:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:45] <Lunocura> Blood Rage is a Lose Condition
[0:31:45] <%saladin1911> People are absolutely downplaying Millia hard
[0:31:48] <lvl10cybermancer> @caprademonv2 Anji isn't that scary right now but Chipp is a monster
[0:31:50] <leith_aziz> People keep downplaying Millia
[0:31:52] <%jepupu> You need to antiair a lot against Millia
[0:31:53] <odd_slater> What shampoo does Millia use?
[0:31:54] <+Shishi1205> Chip players were crying but the things I've seen chip do tells me otherwise
[0:31:54] <Zombrocom> Chipp is very hard to play against. Anji you just need to block and know when he's minus, and throw him out of his spin/counter
[0:31:55] <+snickers_md> I hope they give my boy Faust some buffs, he's in the worst state he's ever been
[0:31:57] <%Shad0wTag> @caprademonv2 Anji is mix up master but Fujin is not safe on block, punish it
[0:31:57] <leith_aziz> I dont think she's bad
[0:31:58] <+yeknomlive> the main gameplan is to never hit blood rage. you wanna be in that third blood tier so your normals become empowered
[0:32:01] <+MugenSandan> Unleash the power of FEET and LOVE THE SUBHUMAN SELF clempsDab clempsDab
[0:32:02] <%dds333a> With obvious weaknesses granted
[0:32:03] <Mnemonicjohnny> @caprademonv2 Both of them are good at doing confusing shit/forcing you to guess or eat a combo, so don't feel bad
[0:32:05] <VJdarkworld> 6P monkaS
[0:32:06] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> why is the Russian lady speaking Japanese?
[0:32:09] <@Menitta> You can cancel Millia's 6H with Bad Moon if they're blocking low to hit with an overhead
[0:32:09] <ullyzeez> pop
[0:32:15] <@Menitta> The first hit of 6H at least
[0:32:16] <+natedrago> WAVE CHECK
[0:32:19] <CruxAustralis> good finish
[0:32:21] <DaKnightWarrior> GOTTEM
[0:32:21] <leith_aziz> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Its sub. Ky's french but he speaks Japanese
[0:32:21] <DSD24> Pose
[0:32:25] <%Shad0wTag> @greenherbwhitesmoke Tell that to the nigerian samurai also speaking Japanese
[0:32:30] <%Moiseivitch> Hey woolie if you FD before going blood rage it stops it until you let go
[0:32:31] <@Menitta> OH
[0:32:34] <Lunocura> holy shit that single super makes me want to play Nag
[0:32:36] <%jepupu> Does Nago's gamma blade have two hitboxes too?
[0:32:36] <@Menitta> THE DASH AFTER A COUNTER
[0:32:37] <%Moiseivitch> So at least its not an instant punish
[0:32:39] <@Menitta> THAT COMBOS
[0:32:42] <Vaunno> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke sol is american and ky is french, they're all just extremely multilingual :)
[0:32:42] <Mnemonicjohnny> @Shad0wTag In his defense, he might literally be Yasuke
[0:32:43] <CruxAustralis> SO CARRY ON
[0:32:46] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> gotcha i thought it was gonna be like tekken where they speak their language
[0:32:49] <KaiGoesMoo> If anyone is curious who the female singer is for the Strive tracks, it's Aisha Dayo
[0:32:55] <OfficerMods> i wish there was a way to counter breaker burst
[0:32:56] <%jolene_orenji> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke it's especially funny when you realize that Japan in the Guilty Gear universe is a country sized smoldering hole in the ground
[0:32:57] <NotHereToStream> for some dumb reason, nagos c.s is such a good anti air
[0:33:03] <+Shishi1205> Nago not having an airdash makes the Max mix up in the air impossible
[0:33:03] <OfficerMods> during a drive of course
[0:33:06] <leith_aziz> The female singer was a great addition to GG OST
[0:33:08] <odd_slater> Grand finals with this OST and chat is going to be fun lmaooo
[0:33:10] <%Shad0wTag> @mnemonicjohnny To be honest considering he's nightless/vampire is possible
[0:33:10] <leith_aziz> She's great as a singer
[0:33:11] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> lmao trueeee @jolene_orenji
[0:33:18] <ferbeholds> Hahaha!
[0:33:19] <@Menitta> Millia's c.5s is amazing for combo starters
[0:33:22] <%saladin1911> @shad0wtag Nago has been around due to being a vampire so probably speaks a ton of languages
[0:33:29] <leith_aziz> Millia's close S is a good anti air
[0:33:32] <%jolene_orenji> isn't throw like insanely fast in this game
[0:33:33] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> is ino any good in this game?
[0:33:36] <OfficerMods> woolie manually puts himself in the corner
[0:33:37] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji 2 frames
[0:33:39] <+Shishi1205> RISC high
[0:33:40] <OfficerMods> gets away with it
[0:33:43] <Vaunno> i love how nago is just canonically a weeb
[0:33:44] <NotHereToStream> man you got to react to the raw command dash, too unsafe
[0:33:45] <VJdarkworld> mixin' ?!
[0:33:46] <Daniel_Is_I> The fucking frametrap into bite is so sick
[0:33:50] <@Menitta> I've found myself trying to use it as an anti air but kept fucking up
[0:33:51] <%jepupu> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Around B tier
[0:33:51] <%jolene_orenji> @jolene_orenji crazy
[0:33:52] <+Arnschen> When Nago goes in
[0:33:53] <%saladin1911> I hate throws in this game, I won't lie. They feel super weird
[0:33:54] <leith_aziz> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Its too early to say. Insane mix but kinda low damage
[0:33:54] <%Shad0wTag> @kaigoesmoo Aisha only does May theme last I checked. Millia's theme is another female signer
[0:33:56] <%dds333a> @odd_slater I could be wrong, but I don't think Angra would appreciate Shampoo
[0:33:57] <@Menitta> It whiffs if they're too high
[0:33:57] <%Shad0wTag> *singer
[0:33:59] <+Mrthefro> Hamboned
[0:34:01] <%buff_shiba> buff_shiba subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Wooolie Reggie. You're playing Strive!
[0:34:03] <+MugenSandan> Wow was the bite a read or did he combo into it?
[0:34:04] <DSD24> How does Nago's mask work
[0:34:11] <emptyantics> Ubga Unbaged
[0:34:12] <Zombrocom> It gives you about 3 bars of blood to work with
[0:34:17] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> hmm i see so @leith_aziz
[0:34:18] <leith_aziz> @DSD24 It suppresses his bloodlust
[0:34:18] <%X2Eliah> @DSD24 it goes over his face
[0:34:19] <Sandofvitch> Mask off angy, mask on less angy.
[0:34:21] <Lunocura> @DSD24 rule of cool
[0:34:22] <%dds333a> Grabbed out
[0:34:28] <+Shishi1205> having blood is good for nago btw, not popping is his problem
[0:34:29] <DSD24> All of these are good answers
[0:34:31] <NotHereToStream> acting like you won't get command grabbed
[0:34:33] <Mnemonicjohnny> @MugenSandan Nah, it's a command grab -- won't combo, ever.
[0:34:36] <brunoberserk> i love this game a LOT ... but i miss the instant kills :(
[0:34:37] <%Shad0wTag> @mugensandan frame trap
[0:34:39] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> is woolie using his bite as a meaty?
[0:34:43] <Vaunno> no, but the mask just disappears behind his head tho
[0:34:47] <%jepupu> Wakeup throws are something I never adjusted to
[0:34:49] <%jolene_orenji> @Shishi1205 so basically playing nago is all about blood edging
[0:34:51] <Vaunno> where does it go?????
[0:34:53] <leith_aziz> @brunoberserk Im thinking they'll get added later on
[0:34:54] <+Shishi1205> yes
[0:35:01] <%dds333a> @brunoberserk who knows, they might be secret, like GG1 Kappa
[0:35:03] <emptyantics> Talkin mad shit for someone in command grab distance sumitoLIZIQ
[0:35:04] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OfficerMods
[0:35:04] <leith_aziz> They probably got cut cause of C-vid
[0:35:06] <KaiGoesMoo> @Shad0wTag I'm pretty sure they're all her including Ram's theme
[0:35:06] <Zombrocom> I think reggie is the chillest millia I have ever seen
[0:35:13] <TigerClaws12> Reggie woolie hasn't been playing man
[0:35:16] <GarbageNirvana> What are they playing this on right now?
[0:35:16] <@Solidus_113> let's get some new music in there too
[0:35:17] <+FingaLights> @Vaunno Magic? Shrug
[0:35:27] <Sandofvitch> Nano machines, son.
[0:35:33] <%Broand> Zero haircars
[0:35:33] <leith_aziz> huh, Woolie's pretty good
[0:35:35] <%jepupu> Is the wakeup throw just a read, or some safe meaty tech?
[0:35:36] <Saltmeisterr> ye lets put random music on
[0:35:37] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 Its a pitty even with random in rematch it goes to the same song
[0:35:37] <%Gamefriendly> @GarbageNirvana probably ps5
[0:35:38] <leith_aziz> At neutral I mean
[0:35:41] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the one hit kill only comes out when you input the perfect roman cancel
[0:35:47] <+PR0swagonist> we need a poll for which songs to make woolie listen to next
[0:35:50] <OfficerMods> having a giant fuck off sword helps
[0:36:03] <Saltmeisterr> @PR0swagonist Sol's theme
[0:36:09] <%dds333a> Nice
[0:36:09] <TigerClaws12> hell yea
[0:36:12] <%Shad0wTag> @kaigoesmoo On the ost Millia's theme has Jamison Boaz as the credit but May's has Aisha specifically and only her
[0:36:14] <Smitteys867> @woolieversus U gonna watch the Japan vs North America 10v10 exhibition later today?
[0:36:14] <leith_aziz> I wish there was an option between Random in ever match (even rematch), or a single random song staying for each rematch
[0:36:21] <+natedrago> May theme for the memes
[0:36:25] <%jepupu> My password is: OUT OF THE BOX (woo-oo-oo-o-oooh)
[0:36:25] <Mnemonicjohnny> Reggie might get a little more use out of the haircar's disjoint if he wants to challenge more
[0:36:28] <leith_aziz> @PR0swagonist Zato's theme
[0:36:32] <+Dionman19> millia theme is so good tho
[0:36:35] <Sandofvitch> Zato theme for feels
[0:36:42] <%buff_shiba> @leith_aziz That's why I think Nago is a good character for him. I think Woolie's neutral is strong so playing a character who gets huge rewards is his style.
[0:36:46] <Vaunno> now now chat, how about ALL of the songs?
[0:36:48] <leith_aziz> We need to listen to Zato's FULL them. and I mean 6 minutes
[0:36:48] <+Shishi1205> Zato's themes best part is like 5 minutes in
[0:36:52] <OfficerMods> love the suboptimal self
[0:36:52] <+egalitarian696969> he ain't lost a step
[0:36:57] <+RowenCleric> Hey Axl whats your wi-fi password
[0:36:57] <VJdarkworld> monkaS NEED , MORE , POWERRRR
[0:36:57] <emptyantics> That sword hilt tap he does after his over head üëå
[0:37:00] <Sandofvitch> Screw it, Fuuga.
[0:37:02] <+ttvp> Leo‚Äôs theme is high up there for me
[0:37:06] <%jepupu> I'm just happy that Midnight Carnival and Still in the Dark are unlockable.
[0:37:08] <Zombrocom> I love how good woolie still is at nago even after so much time
[0:37:09] <Daniel_Is_I> @PR0swagonist May's theme
[0:37:19] <Lunocura> Is Nago a zoner?
[0:37:20] <leith_aziz> Its annoying that Name of Heaven cant be used in fights
[0:37:28] <@Menitta> This is also the first game where i felt it necessary to use the Dash Macro
[0:37:29] <dustworthmain> it feels hard to fuzzy jump in this game since you can delay some buttons a lot and grabs are fast
[0:37:29] <leith_aziz> Name of Heaven is SUCH a good song personally
[0:37:30] <%dds333a> @lunocura not at all
[0:37:34] <Vaunno> and crawl...
[0:37:36] <+R0kushi> nago has awoken
[0:37:36] <+jaayro> @lunocura Kiind of, but not really
[0:37:37] <Vaunno> man
[0:37:39] <+ProF_88> IMO Nago is a hard matchup for Millia specifically
[0:37:40] <%Shad0wTag> @lunocura Nago can be rush down or played like a Sam Sho character
[0:37:40] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> what happens when nago gets too much blood?
[0:37:45] <@Solidus_113> Crawl is so fucking good
[0:37:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Trigger is a great theme but it hits different than most GG songs.
[0:37:49] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta a dashing Sol approaches
[0:37:54] <%X2Eliah> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke pain
[0:37:55] <leith_aziz> @Vaunno Crawl will probabl√∂y be Happy Chaos' theme if he got added
[0:37:55] <ullyzeez> @lunocura you see that sword and think zoner??
[0:38:01] <%jepupu> Nago is pretty good against short range rushdowns, yeah.
[0:38:02] <Zombrocom> Nagos... odd. He likes to go in on low blood and keep you out on high blood. He's like a midscreen monster.
[0:38:02] <Lunocura> yeh
[0:38:03] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> thx @X2Eliah
[0:38:13] <+natedrago> I hope Happy gets a new theme instead tbh
[0:38:13] <shadepman> millias voice is hot
[0:38:15] <+jaayro> @lunocura He just has a lot of range on his normals especially at high blood. But you can't zone traditionally since you can't just spam his projectile
[0:38:20] <%buff_shiba> That was a sick Airthrow
[0:38:22] <%dds333a> Oh, the pause LULpause
[0:38:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ok reggie occasionally drops her air combo as well, I'm not that bad LUL
[0:38:25] <+Shishi1205> Yoo lbue Rc
[0:38:25] <@Menitta> good burst
[0:38:25] <+egalitarian696969> backdash brc backdash
[0:38:26] <Mnemonicjohnny> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke you get super cancer for 30% life, lose access to specials, but basically get a SamSho super.
[0:38:29] <Vaunno> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke he loses tons of health and most of his specials but gets a new super and max range normals
[0:38:31] <leith_aziz> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke If the meter's not 100%, his normals get faster and get better range
[0:38:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> floor 9 and 10 are sweaty
[0:38:39] <%jepupu> ENG Dub I-No is incredibly horny.
[0:38:39] <leith_aziz> If Its FULL, he loses 50% health
[0:38:49] <%Shad0wTag> Millias dib VA is Tara Platt the voice for Mitsuru in P3
[0:38:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:51] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> thats a really cool gimic
[0:38:53] <+zuzuxiv> OHHH THAT MIXUP
[0:38:54] <Mnemonicjohnny> Oh, they upped it
[0:38:55] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> gimmick
[0:38:56] <NotHereToStream> double crossup you cheeky bastard
[0:38:56] <shadepman> damn woolie rusty as
[0:38:57] <Sandofvitch> Fun fact: Japanese I-No shares voice with Lady Dimitriscu
[0:38:58] <%dds333a> My god, moving
[0:39:00] <+MugenSandan> He's got SHIMMIES
[0:39:01] <+egalitarian696969> good nago players will get to 2nd level blood and just play with normals/dash
[0:39:02] <%Shad0wTag> @jepupu As she should be
[0:39:03] <leith_aziz> The dub's pretty good, but I use Sub cause I hate ENG Sol and I main him
[0:39:06] <Daniel_Is_I> Nago is very feast-or-famine, so he has to play deliberately
[0:39:07] <%Th3rd3> thebamboozle
[0:39:11] <leith_aziz> its akward position to be in
[0:39:12] <+Shishi1205> THE BEES KNEES

[0:39:44] <+R0kushi> DO NOT WOLLOW IN DEFEAT
[0:39:44] <+Mrthefro> The King of Throw
[0:39:45] <CryptusMaximus> Eng Dub Leo, Gio, and I-No are factually the best versions. Everyone else is debatable.
[0:39:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> MY GEEEEEE
[0:39:45] <Lunocura> man Reggie ALMOST did a cool thing back there
[0:39:45] <TigerClaws12> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt

[0:40:00] <dustworthmain> not mashing hard enough reggie
[0:40:04] <leith_aziz> @caprademonv2 Gold Burst is dong Burst when you're not getting hit. If it lands, you get 100% meter
[0:40:04] <TigerClaws12> FeelsAmazingMan PJSalt rub em all over Reggie romollaBurger
[0:40:05] <samcast1> bullshit blazing
[0:40:06] <cromenguy> Now it's Reggie that has to watch his blood guage
[0:40:07] <+sundayafternoon1> I feel like triple 5P isn‚Äôt real
[0:40:08] <+Pannkko> alfaBot
[0:40:08] <Mnemonicjohnny> @caprademonv2 Blue only comes out when you're in hitstun and is purely defensive. Red's in neutral, and it gives 100% meter on hit.
[0:40:09] <%Moiseivitch> NotLikeThis not like this reggie
[0:40:09] <MidnightPacif1c> love your subhuman no wallbreak self
[0:40:10] <OfficerMods> thats spinny sword move is 0 btw
[0:40:12] <BluBox> 5 frames
[0:40:14] <+Fiiib> like 5 frames iirc
[0:40:15] <OfficerMods> you can contest it
[0:40:16] <+StrikeTheErf> @WoolieVersus reggie 5 frames
[0:40:18] <+Shishi1205> talk to the hand reggie
[0:40:21] <GarbageNirvana> Gorilla game
[0:40:23] <TheChapyGuy> 5 frames for jab, 6 for 2P
[0:40:24] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> how does nago disperse blood?
[0:40:27] <leith_aziz> @CryptusMaximus Dont know about I-No, but Dub Leo is SO good
[0:40:29] <realfiction> Oh nice colors
[0:40:31] <+kumaprime> Reggie Gear Sodium Rising Revengence
[0:40:31] <$Noponis> @OfficerMods he actually cant. Millia has the slowest fast normals in the game
[0:40:34] <NotHereToStream> can't beat sols 3 frame 5k
[0:40:35] <%Shad0wTag> @cryptusmaximus I personally enjoy dub Pot
[0:40:36] <%dds333a> Nice purple CarlSmile
[0:40:39] <OfficerMods> Ha ha yeah...
[0:40:39] <+Shishi1205> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Normals landing and bite
[0:40:39] <lvl10cybermancer> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke Hitting with sword normals or landing his command grab
[0:40:42] <TheChapyGuy> what a mad man
[0:40:42] <snow_soldier> He just had to wait it out
[0:40:45] <snow_soldier> He would've popped
[0:40:45] <%saladin1911> The lord has made Woolie stronger. Knowledge is truly the greatest form of power LUL
[0:40:48] <ullyzeez> look at the blood reggie
[0:40:49] <Vaunno> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke certain moves resore a slight bit, a command grab restores a TON
[0:40:49] <%saladin1911> lore*
[0:40:51] <leith_aziz> Sol's 5K is 3 frames and Chipp's jab is 3 frames
[0:40:51] <+zuzuxiv> omfg woolie
[0:40:52] <+snickers_md> those jabs
[0:40:54] <leith_aziz> They have strong pokes
[0:40:56] <didgereedoodah> why does Millia not have a 5f normal
[0:40:56] <+Shishi1205> lmao the RISC just by jabbing
[0:40:58] <Saltmeisterr> woolie plz
[0:40:59] <Daniel_Is_I> That's a crossup and a half
[0:40:59] <Sandofvitch> I prefer dubbed tbh. I love Jackie english voice.
[0:41:01] <BluBox> Nice use of j.P
[0:41:02] <Mnemonicjohnny> JESUS, REGGIE
[0:41:02] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> ohh so its blood he is losing not gaining got it
[0:41:05] <+yeknomlive> dam nago got a 5f.
[0:41:09] <%dds333a> @saladin1911 Praise God Almighty
[0:41:12] <$Noponis> because millia with a 5f normal would be bullshit
[0:41:13] <+pkmamsters> Reggie embraces the subhuman self
[0:41:15] <+TopTieramisu> what a round from reggie
[0:41:17] <+zuzuxiv> nice reggieee
[0:41:18] <leith_aziz> @Sandofvitch Hey, pick what you like. Both are great options
[0:41:18] <TheChapyGuy> nice combo, Reggie
[0:41:18] <morow1ec> Damn Reggie angrz
[0:41:21] <Mnemonicjohnny> godDAMN that was nice
[0:41:21] <%X2Eliah> thats good
[0:41:21] <+sundayafternoon1> Pretty sure 5Px3 ain‚Äôt real unless you input a command normal afterward
[0:41:22] <$Noponis> millia always has had slow jabs
[0:41:22] <DaKnightWarrior> Jabing like it's SFxTK
[0:41:24] <%saladin1911> @dds333a That was a typo but it works lmfao
[0:41:25] <lvl10cybermancer> The fucked up thing is, Millia's fastest button is the same speed as fucking Axl's fastest button
[0:41:27] <samcast1> what a vengeful man
[0:41:27] <Lunocura> Look how hard Millia has to work for a fraction of what Nago's slaps do
[0:41:32] <%Shad0wTag> love thy hitsun self
[0:41:36] <%buff_shiba> Reggie givin Woolie the Shmix
[0:41:41] <+Fiiib> Does Woolie know that holding down FD will stop him from popping into Blood Rage automatically?
[0:41:44] <+yeknomlive> mlia's fastest button is 2k so weird. her 5p is 7f
[0:41:49] <leith_aziz> @Fiiib huh?
[0:41:52] <Vaunno> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke it's more like a thirst meter lol, higher it is the more insane and blood-starved he becomes
[0:41:54] <+yeknomlive> nago's c.s is 7f
[0:41:56] <+Shishi1205> I've seen NAgo one shot a 80% life Zato
[0:41:58] <+jaayro> Nago hurts omg
[0:41:58] <Sandofvitch> Yeah, i agree. English Sol voice is just growling xD but i dig it too.
[0:42:01] <leith_aziz> You cant give Millia everything
[0:42:03] <theinfamousq> I'm so glad he gets to enjoy his game a little bit and relax
[0:42:07] <+Shishi1205> In will it kill 6
[0:42:08] <TigerClaws12> LOL
[0:42:09] <leith_aziz> She has strengths and weaknesses
[0:42:11] <$Noponis> nago cS is crazy in general
[0:42:12] <gunstars20> F
[0:42:13] <leith_aziz> Nice
[0:42:17] <zashzila> Nago vibe check.
[0:42:22] <+Checktrap> CLAPEPD
[0:42:27] <NotHereToStream> gut rating for her sucks
[0:42:28] <%jepupu> Reversal supers!
[0:42:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> Millia has to get a 9-5, 2 part time jobs and a crypto portfolio just to get a THIRD of Nagoriyuki's powers. SAD!
[0:42:30] <Cybergator> man I love that nago super
[0:42:31] <+Fiiib> @Fiiib Yeah, you can burn meter to prevent from popping, some people don't know this so you can let them get close to you and then you let go to pop
[0:42:32] <$thesickestzak> nliDX
[0:42:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> milia has some of the slowest buttons in the game too
[0:42:36] <%dds333a> Never not doing oki at least. Reg knows what's up
[0:42:40] <+fetrigon> droppin combos majinoSkiip
[0:42:40] <+R0kushi> nice air grabs
[0:42:42] <Saltmeisterr> can we get a new stage plz?
[0:42:42] <+R0kushi> damn
[0:42:44] <+TopTieramisu> oof
[0:42:45] <leith_aziz> Chipp has eve lower health, but he's actually really good in Strive. Like maybe Top 5
[0:42:46] <Sandofvitch> bruh
[0:42:46] <LorcaNomad> OOOH
[0:42:46] <DaKnightWarrior> Nice grab
[0:42:47] <leith_aziz> *even
[0:42:48] <VJdarkworld> PERFECT monkaS
[0:42:49] <@Menitta> daaamn
[0:42:50] <+Checktrap> terrible burst
[0:42:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damn
[0:42:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[0:42:56] <Lunocura> poor millia man
[0:42:59] <Daniel_Is_I> How is it such an intense back-and-forth?
[0:43:00] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Top 5? for real?
[0:43:01] <BluBox> Woolie already godlike
[0:43:03] <OfficerMods> I've never gotten more perfects in any fight game than strive
[0:43:04] <+Shishi1205> Doesnt Millia have the worst defense stat? Or is that Zato?
[0:43:06] <%Irridium> chipp's command grab fucks me up every single time feelsbadman
[0:43:10] <Zombrocom> Chipp
[0:43:12] <%X2Eliah> @Fiiib That''s how you can keep at like 2 or 3 for the damage boost?
[0:43:12] <%jolene_orenji> @FuqBoiSlim meanwhile potemkin is over here doing 60% of your bar with one command grab and wondering why millenials spend so much on avocado toast
[0:43:15] <Sandofvitch> Chipp
[0:43:15] <%Shad0wTag> @daniel_is_i thats strive for you man
[0:43:16] <Zombrocom> Chipp has the worst defense
[0:43:18] <%buff_shiba> @FuqBoiSlim She also needs to walk to work everyday.
[0:43:19] <OfficerMods> you can just instantly delete people if you get the right pressure going
[0:43:19] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag Japan seems to think he's really good, and as his main I can see it
[0:43:21] <Vaunno> with guts nago actually has the most effective health in the game
[0:43:21] <+Mrthefro> Send help MonkaS
[0:43:22] <%dds333a> @shishi1205 it's Chipp
[0:43:23] <%LCGOV> man I feel like I should try picking up Nago, he looks so fun to play compared to my main (Ky)
[0:43:26] <lvl10cybermancer> Gotta use that meter
[0:43:27] <%dds333a> By a country mile
[0:43:29] <leith_aziz> Chipp's like Akuma
[0:43:31] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji you damn right we do that
[0:43:33] <%GarouFGC> Chipp has the lowest Heath, Zato has the lowest Guts/Defence.
[0:43:34] <leith_aziz> Strong neutral but low health
[0:43:35] <+Shishi1205> @dds333a thats health not guts
[0:43:39] <+fetrigon> Copium
[0:43:44] <emptyantics> Copium
[0:43:45] <Josef_Stryker> You got this Reggie!
[0:43:47] <%jolene_orenji> @Shad0wTag hell yeah brother
[0:43:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> believe in the subhuman self reggie!
[0:43:48] <+Shishi1205> So yeah Zato
[0:43:54] <caprademonv2> it surprises me how effective nago's projectile can be
[0:43:56] <+patel347> the look on woolies face right now
[0:43:56] <Mr_216> sajamDegen
[0:43:57] <cheap_turbo> anyone got the win count?
[0:43:58] <+Fiiib> @Fiiib nah, it's only to prevent you from going over, doesn't effect the blood gauge from rising
[0:44:00] <Zombrocom> Nago has the second highest defense and the second highest guts. Pot has highest defense and anji of all people has highest guts
[0:44:01] <leith_aziz> @Vaunno That's Gio with full bar, then Potemkin
[0:44:01] <%dds333a> @shishi1205 were you not referring to health? I thought you were
[0:44:01] <+Shishi1205> But millia is down there
[0:44:07] <+yeknomlive> projectile is really good but it does fill a lot of meter
[0:44:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @patel347 laser focus
[0:44:09] <emptyantics> Is May the best character right now?
[0:44:14] <OfficerMods> no
[0:44:15] <+Shishi1205> No, defense/guts
[0:44:18] <OfficerMods> she's up there
[0:44:22] <%Shad0wTag> @jolene_orenji My brother, this is our time and our game to command grab the roster
[0:44:24] <ullyzeez> no
[0:44:25] <leith_aziz> @emptyantics Sol and Ram are. But May's Top 3 Id say
[0:44:25] <%Irridium> @emptyantics nah I'd say Sol
[0:44:30] <leith_aziz> May is REALLY good
[0:44:30] <austinj24> I think 5k works after that rd to l.p.
[0:44:30] <%jolene_orenji> @emptyantics I think most people have Sol as the best rn
[0:44:32] <%dds333a> @shishi1205 ah, I see. so yeah, Zato
[0:44:33] <%jepupu> You can jump out of Nago's 3-hit canned combo after hit 2? Interesting.
[0:44:37] <sunnythedrunk> Consensus top 3 right now are Sol, May, and Ram
[0:44:40] <Sandofvitch> I would love to see Testament and A.B.A back.
[0:44:41] <OfficerMods> may counters ram pretty hard
[0:44:42] <+StrikeTheErf> millia's fastest button is 6 frames iirc
[0:44:43] <@Menitta> oooooh lullabyyyy don't stop
[0:44:43] <austinj24> disregard the gibberish
[0:44:44] <%X2Eliah> So Woolie is NOT a talker during these rounds
[0:44:45] <%Akizea> @emptyantics apparently chipp is up there too. a lot of people say hes better than chipp
[0:44:45] <Daniel_Is_I> @emptyantics Chipp's pretty high up there too
[0:44:45] <Hideow> it's between her,sol and ram,maybe those last two more then may
[0:44:46] <GarbageNirvana> Sol's bonkers
[0:44:51] <%Shad0wTag> @emptyantics She's up there
[0:44:53] <Hideow> and chipp yeah
[0:44:55] <redhotdivekick> Sol is definitely number 1, that character is nuts
[0:44:55] <KaiGoesMoo> I don't know how to deal with Ram's wall trap pressure... it's so oppressive
[0:44:55] <+zuzuxiv> I love this song dude goddamn
[0:44:56] <snow_soldier> Kapel is super good at calling out airthrows
[0:44:58] <+Shishi1205> Sol, Ram and May in that order? or may before ram?
[0:44:58] <@Menitta> OH MAN
[0:44:59] <%Akizea> a lot of people say chipp is better than sol*
[0:45:00] <%jepupu> Sol: *Runs up and presses S*
[0:45:01] <lvl10cybermancer> Hot take, May is not even top 5
[0:45:03] <didgereedoodah> people would say Leo and Chipp are better than May
[0:45:04] <leith_aziz> @emptyantics I'd say Chipp is a Top 5 contender. Same with Gio
[0:45:05] <Sandofvitch> If they make another game, i wonder if Sol be there ?
[0:45:07] <+Adalore> Find that power
[0:45:08] <@Menitta> that was a bonkers combo
[0:45:13] <%buff_shiba> Yo Reggie with the Post super combos!
[0:45:14] <ullyzeez> bruh it lookin like most people here dont even play the game but say so much shit
[0:45:15] <%dds333a> What a match
[0:45:16] <sunnythedrunk> May and Ram are interchangeable, game hasn't been out long enough to decide
[0:45:18] <Vaunno> @leith_aziz i read nago still has more than gio at 100% tension
[0:45:20] <leith_aziz> Chipp has great neutral and toolkit and Gio has strong buttons
[0:45:23] <Vaunno> weird
[0:45:24] <CryptusMaximus> Sol has normals that look like specials lmao
[0:45:27] <Zombrocom> Top 5 is likely Sol Ram May Gio Chipp, in some order. Who knows.
[0:45:31] <+Shishi1205> Chip is a menace dont let his low life deceive you
[0:45:33] <leith_aziz> @ullyzeez I play the game
[0:45:34] <sunnythedrunk> I've seen pros say May is better other say Ram
[0:45:42] <%buff_shiba> @ullyzeez What do you mean. This game is sick!
[0:45:43] <OfficerMods> who is top 5 then? sol ram chip eddie....ky?
[0:45:47] <+slaughterpuff> May's are death incarnate. only played 2 but I never stood a chance. May is freaking terrifying.
[0:45:48] <@Menitta> Chipp has earned that low health
[0:45:48] <%jepupu> I think in Ram vs May, Ram has a slight upper hand. She can just f.S or HS her totsugekis.
[0:45:52] <leith_aziz> @sunnythedrunk One can argue, but I just see Ram having better stuff
[0:45:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[0:45:53] <@Menitta> He is good
[0:45:54] <+Shishi1205> I think May is better now but that may change later
[0:45:59] <Josef_Stryker> RIP
[0:46:00] <%Irridium> the top 5 is who-ever is beating me now and hurting my feelings :(
[0:46:00] <%Shad0wTag> I'd say Ram is the best because she has low risk and high reward
[0:46:06] <+egalitarian696969> I just YRC now instead of trying to get reversal super timing
[0:46:08] <DaKnightWarrior> I love Strives speed to death. already at game 9.
[0:46:09] <%Shad0wTag> may still has stuff that requires risk
[0:46:10] <+Adalore> the Nago auto combo needs to threaten the chain into something else, their turn ends at the end of the 3 swings without RC.
[0:46:12] <%Afterman_> reggie at risk
[0:46:17] <+sundayafternoon1> Ram sucks at dealing with pressure though
[0:46:17] <%dds333a> @buff_shiba he's referring to those that comment on the game, without having actually played it. it happens often.
[0:46:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at least you ain't dying with a full stick of butter
[0:46:18] <Hideow> hard to say at this point,the game is still very new
[0:46:18] <Daniel_Is_I> I'm not sure Gio is top 5 but she's certainly not bad.
[0:46:19] <NotHereToStream> And Sol is just unga to win
[0:46:20] <+slaughterpuff> Ram is def up there
[0:46:21] <cheap_turbo> oh, the win count is on that screen, I forgot
[0:46:26] <OfficerMods> @jepupu you just block the sword right after she tosses it you can totsugeki away from the explosion and ram is now playing dolphin games
[0:46:28] <leith_aziz> II presonally think Ram is better than Sol because her fullscreen game is much scarier
[0:46:31] <+TopTieramisu> i want to see the woolie pat runback in strive
[0:46:37] <%Shad0wTag> Ram puts you in the corner immediately
[0:46:40] <+Shishi1205> So in "worst" cahracters, Faust and Millia?
[0:46:41] <sunnythedrunk> @leith_aziz May's command grab combos and ram's lack of reversal makes me think May is better persnally
[0:46:43] <ullyzeez> @shishi1205 bruh can i get a copy of your game wtf
[0:46:46] <Mnemonicjohnny> @Adalore Well, that's why you never go the full three -- the actual schmix is at 2
[0:46:47] <+egalitarian696969> Sol 3f 5k nuff said
[0:46:53] <Daniel_Is_I> @Shishi1205 Anji is apparently pretty bad too
[0:46:55] <VJdarkworld> clearly, every character is top 5 Kappa
[0:46:56] <Vaunno> @Shishi1205 faust and anji
[0:46:57] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 Faust and Anji MAYBE. Game's only out for 2 weeks
[0:46:59] <+sundayafternoon1> @leith_aziz Nah vortex can go full screen anyway
[0:47:01] <fluke_LKZ> Worst characters are a tossup between Faust and Anji, Milliais far from worst.
[0:47:02] <didgereedoodah> May doesn't have a reversal either
[0:47:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Shishi1205 nah millia is by far not worst with faust
[0:47:05] <Dave_VD> @Adalore You can cancel it part way into a hS, command normal, or special
[0:47:07] <+egalitarian696969> faust and anji are top 15
[0:47:07] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 Not Millia at all. Maybe Anji?
[0:47:08] <%buff_shiba> @dds333a That's fine. I mean who cares what people who don't even play the game think. Tell to go play skullgirls or +R.
[0:47:10] <leith_aziz> Anji suffers hard rom characters with DP
[0:47:10] <+Adalore> Naw the third swing exists after you triple guess your foe into a mess @Mnemonicjohnny
[0:47:12] <%saladin1911> Ram probably has some of the worst defence in the game which holds her back. Without meter, you can bully her
[0:47:14] <Zombrocom> Millia players love to downplay her strength
[0:47:15] <NotHereToStream> Anji's Fujin is nothing when you learn to delay your attack or just block
[0:47:16] <Vaunno> @egalitarian696969 KEKW
[0:47:16] <+yeknomlive> @Shishi1205 depends. as bad as i think faust is his match ups arent as bad as some of the others
[0:47:16] <leith_aziz> So its matchup dependent
[0:47:20] <+Shishi1205> Yeah Anji, forgot him lamo
[0:47:21] <OfficerMods> yeah may struggles if you pin her down and sit on her face
[0:47:28] <%jepupu> @OfficerMods As a Ram I wouldn't really throw the swords unless I could hit confirm them. Not on blockstrings, even on cofner just one of them.
[0:47:29] <+yeknomlive> but faust does get bodied by the top 4 really hard
[0:47:34] <leith_aziz> I dont really GET why Faust is bad
[0:47:38] <+TopTieramisu> reggie's on the board again
[0:47:40] <leith_aziz> Everybody says he's bad
[0:47:41] <Mnemonicjohnny> Reggie gettin' the download
[0:47:42] <%jolene_orenji> @OfficerMods yeah but what about when you're fighting her
[0:47:42] <CryptusMaximus> uh oh Reggie got combos?
[0:47:44] <%jepupu> corner*
[0:47:46] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz He relies on too much RNG
[0:47:46] <GrooovinMagic> Nago's getting up animation is awesome.
[0:47:52] <anarcho_bidenism> Is this game as trash as Kappa thought it would be?
[0:47:55] <+Shishi1205> Item toss up is not as good now or so they say
[0:47:58] <%dds333a> Gotta reserve yourself, huh LUL
[0:47:59] <+Gamegenie222> Faust is missing a bunch of stuff mostly
[0:48:01] <%Irridium> Faust is really not bad he's got great normals
[0:48:05] <didgereedoodah> @leith_aziz he kills himself with trumpet
[0:48:08] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag I know Trumpet is awfull, but thats about it
[0:48:09] <+Gamegenie222> either frames or damage or both
[0:48:10] <DaKnightWarrior> Good stuff
[0:48:13] <%Shad0wTag> But he isn't good enough basically
[0:48:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Just casually throw a neutral tool for your opponent to use
[0:48:15] <Vaunno> @anarcho_bidenism yes, because jam isn't in it yet
[0:48:16] <+yeknomlive> his damage is atrocious for one
[0:48:17] <didgereedoodah> and low damage
[0:48:18] <%jepupu> Faust: Where's GOING MY WAY?!
[0:48:19] <+Gamegenie222> also some hitboxes
[0:48:20] <Zombrocom> Nago is minus during forward teleport unless he does it out of clone, reggie really needs to contest woolie there
[0:48:21] <TrashMammalVEVO> @irridium The fuck are you on? some faust attacks are minus on hit
[0:48:22] <GarbageNirvana> @anarcho_bidenism 30k+ consecutive players on Steam would say no
[0:48:23] <leith_aziz> @anarcho_bidenism We all like it now
[0:48:26] <+MugenSandan> Remember the Golden Rule everyone: The character I play is the worst and the character you play should be nerfed itmejpBOOP
[0:48:26] <Cybergator> sol this, ram that, and I am here struggling most against faust's buttons
[0:48:27] <NotHereToStream> nice conversoin
[0:48:28] <Mnemonicjohnny> @anarcho_bidenism Who gives a shit what a buncha nerds think, play whatever the fuck you want
[0:48:34] <leith_aziz> Im glad for Strive's success
[0:48:35] <OfficerMods> I played some celestial fausts, not really scary but once they get started its hard to shut them down
[0:48:36] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Its less that he is terrible and more so everyone else is really good
[0:48:36] <%X2Eliah> milia getting in there
[0:48:36] <SpookyBeef7> @yeknomlive As a Faust player myself, he gets bodied by just about everybody except Nago and Potemkin, and those are still just even matchups at best.
[0:48:36] <Saltmeisterr> damn reggs
[0:48:37] <sunnythedrunk> Personally I think after the Top 3 the next tier is Chipp, Gio, Leo, Axl, Zato, Millia in some order
[0:48:38] <%buff_shiba> I love seeing smash players enjoy GG. I've been telling people that the road to Smash players is GG.
[0:48:38] <+yeknomlive> and his normals are really easy to punish and just lose. not to mention the extended hitboxes
[0:48:39] <+sundayafternoon1> Yes Reggie yes
[0:48:42] <leith_aziz> I always wanted it to get big somehow
[0:48:43] <%Irridium> @TrashMammalVEVO ones I've been fighting must've just been good then
[0:48:49] <%dds333a> @mugensandan tell 'em
[0:48:53] <caprademonv2> would Faust be better if his items were an order than rng or would he be op?
[0:48:55] <fluke_LKZ> The game has a lot of things missing, but r/kappa doomposters aren't the voice you want to hear
[0:49:01] <+Shishi1205> Is pot bottom 3 or 4 then?
[0:49:03] <%Shad0wTag> Strive really doesn't have shit characters. Everyone excels are great stuff. Faust just doesn't have enough good stuff
[0:49:06] <+TopTieramisu> JESUS
[0:49:06] <OfficerMods> just make faust's reel in move combable from gatling, done he's good now
[0:49:09] <+Mrthefro> My god
[0:49:09] <TheChapyGuy> I'm not convinced Sol and Ram are as busted as everyone says
[0:49:11] <emptyantics> I really hope Nago is the char that makes it to Samsho
[0:49:14] <%X2Eliah> yooooo
[0:49:15] <GarbageNirvana> Yeah reddit can get fucked
[0:49:15] <+Dionman19> omg
[0:49:17] <VJdarkworld> 0_0
[0:49:18] <leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 Pot is ok. He's slow but his command grab HURT
[0:49:18] <GrooovinMagic> m64StocksUp m64StocksUp m64StocksUp
[0:49:19] <DaKnightWarrior> PogChamp
[0:49:19] <+GelatinBoi> bruh
[0:49:19] <NotHereToStream> extended hurtbox
[0:49:20] <%X2Eliah> YOOOOOOOOO
[0:49:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:49:21] <+egalitarian696969> Foosies
[0:49:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie almost killed himself
[0:49:22] <Sandofvitch> wiw that was cheap
[0:49:22] <BlackermanZX> DAMN
[0:49:23] <+Fiiib> lmao
[0:49:23] <didgereedoodah> bruh
[0:49:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> INSANE
[0:49:26] <+MugenSandan> GET CLIPPED
[0:49:27] <Davimotion96> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:49:27] <InXplotch> I think sol is def busted as fuck
[0:49:28] <roz_en> Yeah, that supers saved my ass a ton
[0:49:29] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> once you pop, the fun don't stop
[0:49:29] <+slaughterpuff> damn rip reggie
[0:49:36] <@Menitta> Its because you're not using color 2 Millia
[0:49:37] <somekindofgnome> Sol and Ram are definitely top tier currently
[0:49:39] <@Menitta> obviously
[0:49:39] <+Gondab> Look at Woolie's face!
[0:49:40] <%Akizea> everyone else needs the amount of options sol has imo
[0:49:41] <+Shishi1205> Yeah I mean I know no one character is trash in strive
[0:49:41] <+fetrigon> kensouBreh Reggie
[0:49:42] <kago_dev> Going to take a shot every time Reggie gets countered SeemsGood
[0:49:42] <%dds333a> AMAI
[0:49:43] <didgereedoodah> I'm not sure about Ram tbh but Sol is wild
[0:49:45] <Sandofvitch> Now i want to play Millia
[0:49:46] <Vaunno> @buff_shiba depending on who you ask the influx of smashers is somehow ruining GG now /shrug
[0:49:49] <sunnythedrunk> Pot is good he just has problems vs the top tier like everyone else
[0:49:49] <%Shad0wTag> @thechapyguy Ram is just low risk high reward
[0:49:51] <ZeeJiggle> So I dunno about y'all, but the music in this game VERY OFTEN sync's up with the action and it's so sick.
[0:49:51] <leith_aziz> I mean Sol is busted, but I cant deny im having fun with him
[0:49:54] <NotHereToStream> sol is top tier, can confirm because i am a sol main
[0:49:58] <leith_aziz> I dont want Sol to get butchered
[0:50:05] <leith_aziz> Just tone down SOME of his stuff
[0:50:05] <+Shishi1205> Void plays a mean Chip
[0:50:12] <Sandofvitch> He literally got butchered in lore
[0:50:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> Watch your feet
[0:50:15] <+sundayafternoon1> Reggie that 5D too short for that range lol
[0:50:16] <%Akizea> @leith_aziz nah, just give everyone else his options lol
[0:50:17] <%Gamefriendly> the boy learnin?
[0:50:18] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz One fear LUL
[0:50:22] <Vaunno> void chip is wild
[0:50:22] <Cybergator> NGL, I like nago's english voice more
[0:50:26] <%buff_shiba> @Vaunno get out of here! One thing I noticed is that even people who you can tell are new to the game, some have some really good neutral.
[0:50:30] <Lunocura> Reggie's wallgame is on point
[0:50:32] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 Pot is mid for me. Scrub killer but can be mixed up to death and only have an invincible wake ip using his ageis reflector super
[0:50:35] <+RyTYoung> Yeyeyeyeye time to see Woolie unleashed!
[0:50:39] <pi_in_the_sci> I love how he has the same silly down positions as Slayer
[0:50:39] <leith_aziz> @Sandofvitch Sol? Not really. He got a conclusion
[0:50:43] <OfficerMods> I try to play sol but i end up just down far slash forward slash gunflame over and over and not much else. Too scared to toss out anything else
[0:50:47] <More_Onn> As an anji player I can safely say, it is pain, almost all of his tools are unsafe on block but I love the spin to win he got so I still play him
[0:50:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pog air throw
[0:50:51] <TheChapyGuy> @Shad0wTag I guess, but I haven't really had trouble playing against Rams or Sols tbh. I've used Nago, so maybe people just wait back and expect me to pop bloodrage
[0:50:52] <%buff_shiba> I'm saying when those newbie smash players learn this game, there will be godlike competition.
[0:50:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> god whenever that first patch notes hit i feel it's gonna be either to extreme or not enough, maybe i'm just scarred from the dbfz patches
[0:51:00] <Sandofvitch> He is no longer badguy just balara.
[0:51:00] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag the life of grappler once again sihg. At least I tasted beta 1 Pot
[0:51:02] <+StrikeTheErf> Ram is a pubstomping character, she crushes people who refuse to block and they go straight to twitter. She's good but not a monster like Sol
[0:51:08] <@Menitta> So how does the moving Roman Cancel work? Do you just input a dash as you do it?
[0:51:09] <Vaunno> @buff_shiba oh absolutely
[0:51:17] <Zombrocom> Yall have never played against a good ram huh?
[0:51:18] <%jepupu> If they'll do online, I'd SO join, finally, if I could today.. but not home. God damnit. sbfpMember
[0:51:21] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Yes. Do dash + RC
[0:51:24] <leith_aziz> Use Macro
[0:51:24] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta yeah
[0:51:27] <leith_aziz> Its better
[0:51:27] <didgereedoodah> @Menitta dash before RC
[0:51:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta ye, preferably at the same time
[0:51:29] <%dds333a> Watch out for that Knee Press expy
[0:51:31] <sunnythedrunk> @buff_shiba Plus all the new players will boost the game's life long term
[0:51:32] <Vaunno> dash first then rc
[0:51:34] <+StrikeTheErf> @Zombrocom I play Ram, I know which parts of her pressure are fake
[0:51:34] <%Shad0wTag> @thechapyguy Not enough people respect Nago
[0:51:36] <TheChapyGuy> @Menitta input dash before the RC input. I find it easiest to use the dash button for it consistently
[0:51:38] <didgereedoodah> like RIGHT before
[0:51:40] <GarbageNirvana> I mean personally I'm having trouble getting off of floor 6
[0:51:41] <fluke_LKZ> Yes, don't ignore the dash macro
[0:51:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta dash then RC should do it
[0:51:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> For a lot of people this will be their first ArcSys game so I wonder how they'll deal with the dreaded ArcSys Balance Patch
[0:51:50] <+tetraes> did woolie make it to heaven floor?
[0:51:55] <CruxAustralis> THE READS
[0:51:57] <+RyTYoung> no way
[0:51:58] <@Menitta> Yeah I do use the Dash button.
[0:52:01] <VJdarkworld> YABAI monkaS
[0:52:01] <@Menitta> Thanks
[0:52:01] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:52:02] <Mnemonicjohnny> I'll confess, I kind of miss Axl being less "zoning" and more "midrange nightmare," like he was in AC+R
[0:52:02] <%buff_shiba> @sunnythedrunk That's what I'm saying! This is good for the FGC. Let people have fun.
[0:52:03] <leith_aziz> @FuqBoiSlim You cant satisfy everybody. Thats all I can say
[0:52:03] <Vaunno> @tetraes he's been too busy to play
[0:52:05] <More_Onn> I have no idea how but I got to floor 9 and I'm kinda trash at this game
[0:52:06] <+Shishi1205> When people Start using Blue RC for Oki nasty stuff its going to be wild
[0:52:07] <%jepupu> @tetraes This is literally the first time Woolie plays Launch strive
[0:52:07] <$Noponis> DED
[0:52:08] <%justmildlilac> Gottem ggs
[0:52:08] <BlackermanZX> holy damn
[0:52:09] <sunnythedrunk> @buff_shiba Trueee
[0:52:09] <+slaughterpuff> I bounce between floors 4-6. I'm not very good but im also not aiming to get very high.
[0:52:10] <+TopTieramisu> nago is so dope
[0:52:15] <DutchDejimaDealer> so any chance the fans can play with woolie in this stream?
[0:52:17] <OfficerMods> I agree ram is a pubstomper once you know when she's negative and when the player likes to toss swords she has only a few tools
[0:52:19] <%X2Eliah> gotta get better at the ramen cancels
[0:52:21] <+snickers_md> @More_Onn same
[0:52:22] <%dds333a> @fuqboislim absolutely MURDERS some BB chars
[0:52:23] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 As a Pot main my guy we still have it good but Ky's zoning is nightmarish
[0:52:27] <didgereedoodah> I'm on floor 9 but I play May so who knows
[0:52:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> blue RC is horrifying especially if you get caught pressing shit in the air
[0:52:31] <+Shishi1205> @AGooseTwitch later yeah
[0:52:43] <%dds333a> @x2eliah mmmm, Ramen Cancels
[0:52:45] <scrublord009> Who here has been ultra blood more Nago in arcade?
[0:52:52] <CruxAustralis> @OfficerMods you can still obliterate people thanks to her aggressivity, even if they are good
[0:52:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:52:53] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag I felt the same in the beta, not consistent enough with flick lmao
[0:52:54] <VJdarkworld> @captainpiledriver i accidentally learned that yesterday and it blew my mind
[0:52:55] <%buff_shiba> Plus I'm not gonna lie. I'm mad impressed with Reggie here. He's not doing the nuts stuff yet, but like a month from now...
[0:52:56] <@Menitta> oookay my millia just got better with knowing how to travel RC
[0:52:56] <Vaunno> beaten? hell no
[0:52:58] <%Shad0wTag> @agoosetwitch Later on
[0:53:00] <+Checktrap> CONFIRMS !!!!!!!!!!
[0:53:04] <caprademonv2> I reached floor 8 last night but I don't feel like I belong there
[0:53:08] <+Adalore> sending woolie back to earth.
[0:53:09] <leith_aziz> All I ask is that Arcsys explains the idea behind their changes in the patch notes
[0:53:10] <Saltmeisterr> yeah a wall break with super gives you oki
[0:53:10] <TheChapyGuy> what a confirm, geezus lol
[0:53:12] <More_Onn> I'm trash AND I play anji, the impostor syndrome is kicking in hard when I see my rank
[0:53:12] <CruxAustralis> Ram is so scary
[0:53:13] <somekindofgnome> @caprademonv2 saame
[0:53:13] <bonebagMEL> Reggie gaming
[0:53:14] <Agami23> i dont know what makes guilty gear so different from other fighting games. but it makes me want to actually try and play it alot
[0:53:17] <leith_aziz> im fine with the changes if they're elaborated on
[0:53:21] <%saladin1911> @officermods Every single button Ram has is negative besides sword toss. People need to learn to get aggressive against her. Her Slash is super scary but once players get past that, she'll drop
[0:53:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've done it to a few people, haven't had anyone use the blue RC on me yet though
[0:53:33] <+snickers_md> I can't wait to play goldlewis, man looks like he'll be fun
[0:53:39] <%jepupu> Wallbreak without super = reset to neutral Wallbreak with super = hard knockdown
[0:53:39] <%Irridium> @Menitta roman cancels in the air reset your movement options so you can just fly with her
[0:53:40] <Vaunno> reggie always had these millia combos, he's wild
[0:53:46] <+Shishi1205> @CaptainPileDriver Im pretty sure people dont know about it
[0:53:48] <Saltmeisterr> @snickers_md sssshhhhh
[0:53:52] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 My issue is being stuck with air projectiles or his dumb overhead kick catching my hitbox while attempting to flick
[0:53:52] <%X2Eliah> nice
[0:53:52] <leith_aziz> @Agami23 I'd say the pacing, designs, music, netcode and the tower system helping you find people at your level
[0:53:53] <bonebagMEL> he really said yolo
[0:53:53] <%zenith0111> Ah, Guilty Gear!
[0:53:53] <GarbageNirvana> What are the odds we'll see a nerf on TOTSUGEKI
[0:54:04] <Zombrocom> Resets!
[0:54:06] <@Menitta> What do you mean? Like your jumps? @Irridium
[0:54:06] <somekindofgnome> Ram doesn't do well under pressure but she's still really, really good otherwise
[0:54:12] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag I can see it
[0:54:14] <%Akizea> @Agami23 ^ all of this.
[0:54:16] <OfficerMods> celestial millia's are just combo machines, get touched once you going through the wall
[0:54:16] <+MugenSandan> Wonder if Woolie knows about Nago's Helicopter RC tech
[0:54:17] <@Menitta> and dashes
[0:54:18] <TheChapyGuy> the duality of Nago
[0:54:20] <Mnemonicjohnny> @GarbageNirvana Low-ish. It's annoying, but maybe not the god-tool everyone makes it out to be
[0:54:21] <%dds333a> Nice dash on Reg
[0:54:22] <leith_aziz> @somekindofgnome Ram has a DP super, so she has options
[0:54:22] <%buff_shiba> @Vaunno I thought Reggie was a smash player exclusively and only started learning other games last year?
[0:54:28] <CruxAustralis> chat no character does good under pressure
[0:54:32] <CruxAustralis> that's the point of pressure LUL
[0:54:35] <ullyzeez> @somekindofgnome she was a reversal super that does close to 40%
[0:54:36] <Agami23> @leith_aziz maybe. all that diffidently helps
[0:54:41] <sunnythedrunk> Also the corner in this game is fucking hell
[0:54:43] <caprademonv2> does anyone else ever do nago super and the initial hit lands but it doesnt continue?
[0:54:45] <%Irridium> @Menitta think jumps too but dashes definitely. fought a few who'd cross me up like 5 times
[0:54:46] <VJdarkworld> My Main = too weak, pls buff. Every Other Character = too op, pls nerf Kappa
[0:54:46] <+Shishi1205> Remember chat if the ram is waking up and she has meter she's doing wake up super
[0:54:52] <%dds333a> @buff_shiba he's played a lot before, he just knows Smash most
[0:54:53] <leith_aziz> @CruxAustralis Sol and Leo exist. Hell, Sol has a 3 frames 5K, so its safe
[0:54:53] <sunnythedrunk> one of the scariest corners in all of fighting games
[0:54:56] <didgereedoodah> dolphins are a meme but they might tone it down just to make people stop complaining
[0:54:57] <@Menitta> Oh jeez. Thats sick
[0:54:58] <Mnemonicjohnny> @caprademonv2 Yeah, that happens when you're a little too far away
[0:55:01] <More_Onn> Corner in this game is big danger
[0:55:07] <Zombrocom> Yeah if you hit the tip of nagos super they don't fly up, you can follow that hit up with 6h
[0:55:12] <Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 I would rather face May
[0:55:12] <leith_aziz> @caprademonv2 That's dependet on distabnce
[0:55:15] <OfficerMods> I don't fuck with millia once they start doing cross pressure I YRC erry time
[0:55:18] <+Shishi1205> @caprademonv2 you can still combo after it
[0:55:23] <%athuramn> millias pressure is always so nice to see
[0:55:23] <CruxAustralis> @CruxAustralis Leo in the corner has very few options and is very predictable, Sol is well Sol LUL
[0:55:28] <+CuppaJo3> I just straight up don't believe anyone who downplays their main in this game lol
[0:55:29] <KaiGoesMoo> @caprademonv2 It happens if they're a bit too far away and you hit with the out edge of the hitbox
[0:55:35] <emptyantics> I really dislike that they just flip the models when you switch sides
[0:55:38] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag Sword toss while you head break lmao

[0:55:42] <%X2Eliah> wow that was great
[0:55:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie that millia kinda hot
[0:55:44] <leith_aziz> haha
[0:55:45] <%dds333a> there it is
[0:55:45] <pixel_river> LUL
[0:55:48] <+GelatinBoi> LUL
[0:55:49] <Zombrocom> Yeah that's a good plan. Everyone downplays their main hard
[0:55:49] <%athuramn> LMAO
[0:55:51] <%buff_shiba> Ok. I'm learning more about Reggie. Cool. Now all that's left is for Woolie to learn from the Fame school of Nagoriyuki.
[0:55:51] <%unclekulikov> unclekulikov subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! this game is so pretty :)
[0:55:51] <EA575> where was the respect LUL
[0:55:54] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:55:54] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:55:55] <%athuramn> that was so well timed
[0:55:58] <truelifedood300> any other Anji boys in chat?
[0:55:59] <+ttvp> Reggie putting in some WORK with Millia lol
[0:56:06] <+CuppaJo3> @CuppaJo3 yeah, MAYBE Faust
[0:56:08] <+Shishi1205> I think sol players know they are playing the boss character
[0:56:09] <Vaunno> we out here, throwin
[0:56:11] <Lunocura> Subhuman Self is getting drilled into my brain
[0:56:11] <More_Onn> @truelifedood300 HeyGuys
[0:56:12] <%dds333a> Not letting him free
[0:56:14] <+askalta> nori the grappler
[0:56:17] <NotHereToStream> you should yellow rc instead
[0:56:17] <VJdarkworld> @cuppajo3 ummm u dont get it (my main) is weak, and (your main) is CHEAP and OP Kappa
[0:56:23] <%Irridium> if anyone tries to downlplay sol you smack them
[0:56:30] <+TopTieramisu> @emptyantics you'd prefer just looking at the back of the character on 2p side?
[0:56:33] <leith_aziz> If you lose, itys mostly your fault, not the character
[0:56:33] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 Your just describing my rank session last night dear god
[0:56:35] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> SourPls
[0:56:36] <leith_aziz> *it's
[0:56:37] <OfficerMods> Hate fighting anji, not that hard to deal with but i'm constantly making guesses
[0:56:37] <+CuppaJo3> @VJdarkworld Kappa
[0:56:43] <$razielhex> god damn
[0:56:46] <CruxAustralis> I play Axl :)
[0:56:47] <TheChapyGuy> nice
[0:56:47] <Gigafett> I really want to pick up milla again after seeing reggie work with her
[0:56:47] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag Yeah know that feeling
[0:56:51] <$razielhex> tossed all over the place
[0:56:53] <Vaunno> sheeesh
[0:56:54] <@Menitta> I struggle to find use with Millia's 236H
[0:56:54] <%Irridium> @CruxAustralis same bro
[0:57:01] <+FuqBoiSlim> Guys we to buff Sol he's not as good as yall think. May's way worse seriously
[0:57:01] <@Menitta> a.236H that is
[0:57:01] <+TheMainManAfrika> https://clips.twitch.tv/HotPoorArmadilloNotLikeThis-g0X1lzsXC6FJbwdg
[0:57:01] <%invalid_robin> @OfficerMods His invincible spinning trips me up so bad
[0:57:03] <Teelor32> it's kinda crazy how much im enjoying sol, got a combo i love that guarantees a wall break in the corner
[0:57:05] <Mnemonicjohnny> Man, Reggie's getting spicy here
[0:57:07] <leith_aziz> @Menitta It catches anti airs
[0:57:09] <%Shad0wTag> @lunocura OHHH LULLABY
[0:57:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> (please buy it)
[0:57:09] <Vaunno> goddam reggie chill
[0:57:12] <@Menitta> ooooh
[0:57:13] <%buff_shiba> Have we reached 3rd gear?
[0:57:14] <Daniel_Is_I> @OfficerMods Nothing makes me rage more than thinking I got him only to hear my attack clink on his spin
[0:57:14] <leith_aziz> Also gives her a 3rd jump
[0:57:21] <+StrikeTheErf> you're smoking crack if you think May is better than Sol
[0:57:24] <+Shishi1205> @OfficerMods Throw his ass when he does Fuujin into jump, and challenge fujin when you block it
[0:57:30] <$razielhex> He's so rough
[0:57:34] <+jaggstar2020> No breathing for Nago
[0:57:35] <CatRidder> reggie is beasting on woolie like those habs fans were beasting on that cop car
[0:57:36] <TheChapyGuy> YATTA
[0:57:36] <lvl10cybermancer> May isn't even high tier tbh
[0:57:37] <VJdarkworld> yatta monkaS
[0:57:38] <JayEarly> Millia is a scary matchup for Nago
[0:57:38] <Vaunno> yoooo
[0:57:39] <$razielhex> YATTA
[0:57:40] <%jolene_orenji> YATTA
[0:57:43] <Lunocura> YATTA
[0:57:44] <+natedrago> YATTA
[0:57:45] <leith_aziz> @StrikeTheErf She aint, but MNay is more Spammy than Sol's Far S at times, so different strengths
[0:57:46] <+TopTieramisu> reggie has awakened
[0:57:47] <Saltmeisterr> YATTA
[0:57:47] <%buff_shiba> Reggie the anime protag YATTA
[0:57:48] <leith_aziz> YATTA
[0:57:51] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 However its all made up for me when I pot buster a full screen alpha blade. I start howling in laughter
[0:57:53] <+Checktrap> @lvl10cybermancer you buggin
[0:57:55] <Asuterisuku> game is SO GOOD
[0:57:56] <Lunocura> Ultra Instinct Reggie
[0:58:01] <DaKnightWarrior> Reggie learning the matchup.
[0:58:01] <%zenith0111> Woolie needs to party a bit harder with the blood gauge
[0:58:02] <More_Onn> @OfficerMods That's the thing abt anji, his gameplay is making you guess the entire time
[0:58:03] <+askalta> "no wait im sorry" - reggie beofre popping a cap
[0:58:08] <leith_aziz> @lvl10cybermancer She is 100%
[0:58:09] <%GarouFGC> If you get caught in Sol's pressure, You're going to have a bad time. But if you can abuse the fact that his Normals are really stubby he's not "that" bad.
[0:58:10] <+MugenSandan> Damn how many rounds are we at I've lost count O:
[0:58:11] <$razielhex> he's got that good good setup
[0:58:12] <brunoberserk> Nago is the true YOLO way
[0:58:13] <TheresAGoff> Nago feels like fucking shit
[0:58:14] <Zombrocom> If you think may isn't high tier you need to watch Tempest play
[0:58:16] <+StrikeTheErf> @StrikeTheErf Far S is plus 2, forward advancing, and not even his best button
[0:58:20] <Saltmeisterr> Damn woolie loves his jabs
[0:58:20] <More_Onn> *gameplan
[0:58:21] <+TheMainManAfrika> Some body check reggies blood pressure
[0:58:22] <%X2Eliah> ofc Reggie is the protag, Woolie is literally maining a boss character xD
[0:58:26] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Nago is a great character
[0:58:28] <+Dionman19> i like the chat just saying its a bad match up for whoever is currently losing
[0:58:30] <+cubbywolf> woolie is striving? lets goooooo
[0:58:34] <@Menitta> nice
[0:58:36] <%buff_shiba> Yo that was dirty.
[0:58:37] <2thre3> Damn - that BRC was hype man
[0:58:37] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag Kara cancel all of them, get their asses. Also 6K into flick or garuda impact
[0:58:41] <lvl10cybermancer> @lvl10cybermancer Mark my words once this game develops like a month longer May is not going to be considered top tier anymore
[0:58:44] <$razielhex> get that ass blonde
[0:58:47] <%dds333a> The second swallow
[0:58:50] <Murdercles> Nago is great when Fame is playing him
[0:58:51] <+StrikeTheErf> @Dionman19 lotta floor 5 tier lists in here right now
[0:58:53] <leith_aziz> The fact that Sol can Kara cncel his FAFNIR is insane
[0:58:56] <@Solidus_113> you can punch the dolphin
[0:58:56] <Daniel_Is_I> @lvl10cybermancer Yeah, because she'll get nerfed
[0:58:57] <OfficerMods> As a may player I like to turn off my brain and press buttons, having to "engage" and "think" and "adapt" is toxic to me
[0:58:59] <JayEarly> For all the changes Strive has made, fighting Milia is basically the same
[0:59:00] <%MutedMimic> MutedMimic subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:59:04] <leith_aziz> It covers his distance weakness
[0:59:05] <DaKnightWarrior> Yo, that's a OTG.
[0:59:06] <%justmildlilac> All this pressure and mix and Millia players will STILL be complaining that she's bad because she "does no damage" LUL
[0:59:07] <leith_aziz> Its too much
[0:59:07] <Zombrocom> Because this is an even matchup. EIther millia goes nuts all over nago and ruins him, or nago turns millia into a blood smear.
[0:59:08] <$Noponis> may is already not considered top tier if you dont ask shitters
[0:59:09] <@Menitta> I honestly really dont like playing as May
[0:59:13] <emptyantics> Woolie don‚Äôt let him IN
[0:59:13] <%buff_shiba> @lvl10cybermancer Found the may downplayer ResidentSleeper
[0:59:14] <+Shishi1205> @leith_aziz He can kara gun flame bandit revolver and fafnir
[0:59:17] <$razielhex> slap slap slap slap
[0:59:20] <@Menitta> She's too basic imo
[0:59:23] <%MutedMimic> woolieSPICE
[0:59:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> Palmed
[0:59:26] <TheChapyGuy> your sword normals do chip @WoolieVersus
[0:59:26] <+CuppaJo3> bop
[0:59:31] <Rawbone_saw> SLAP
[0:59:32] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> raptrLul
[0:59:32] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 I have gotten to floor 9 and I still can't do a kara cancel for the life of me
[0:59:32] <%dds333a> jab party
[0:59:34] <%invalid_robin> Love playing may for the memes
[0:59:35] <Rawbone_saw> nice!
[0:59:37] <Asuterisuku> empty jump P
[0:59:37] <Daniel_Is_I> The problem with May isn't even the dolphin. She's got some really great normals too.
[0:59:37] <%zenith0111> Mays top tier and if you dont think so tou must be blind
[0:59:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man watching this just makes me wanna start up strive myself it's so good
[0:59:45] <DaKnightWarrior> Catch these jsbs.
[0:59:48] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag Just inves time on it, super worth
[0:59:48] <NotHereToStream> just 6p the dolphin
[0:59:49] <2thre3> @TheChapyGuy but to kill they need to be on the magic pixel
[0:59:52] <installvirus> imagine arguing tiers for a 3-week old game LUL
[0:59:54] <+slaughterpuff> damn that high flyin combo reggi got off was sick
[0:59:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:59:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> UOOOOHH
[0:59:55] <%Irridium> @Daniel_Is_I May's heavy air slash is evil, man
[0:59:55] <@Menitta> NICE
[0:59:56] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Well, Fafnir is too much. The idea is that he's bad at fullscreen. He needs weaknesses
[0:59:56] <$razielhex> @TheChapyGuy He knows. Woolie got to the celestial tower with Nago.
[1:00:00] <$Noponis> 6p is not even good vs dolphin lmao
[1:00:00] <OfficerMods> instant air dash heavy slash is the best neutral tool in the game
[1:00:04] <$Noponis> not in this gamer
[1:00:05] <sunnythedrunk> May taking off your health bar off a command grab is fucked up
[1:00:08] <%GarouFGC> I think Chipp's better then May IMO, I wouldn't even put May in the top 4.
[1:00:13] <sunnythedrunk> half off
[1:00:15] <Mnemonicjohnny> Man, if this is Woolie day 1, I wanna see him with some training under his belt
[1:00:18] <$Noponis> yeah chipp is better free
[1:00:19] <@Menitta> OH RC FROM BAD MOON
[1:00:20] <More_Onn> I think may is doable but it is way too tough to get a feel for what is S dolphin and what is H dolphin cause both are punishable but in very different ways
[1:00:22] <+Shishi1205> Sol's 2K is better to challenge MAy than 6P
[1:00:24] <didgereedoodah> yeah 2k the Dolphin is better advice a lot of the time
[1:00:24] <%Shad0wTag> @justmildlilac Everytime I'm mixed up I think this
[1:00:25] <@Menitta> damn
[1:00:26] <%zenith0111> @installvirus Imagine barring all disscussions for game thats been played longers than 3 weeks
[1:00:26] <OfficerMods> it only really does damage in the corner though
[1:00:27] <leith_aziz> @GarouFGC I would, but Chipp can be better than May. im not sure
[1:00:28] <@Menitta> I;m learning so much
[1:00:29] <%justmildlilac> 6p does not reliably beat dolphin, don't spread misinformation
[1:00:30] <%athuramn> woolis looks like he's summoning something from the netherrealms as he plays
[1:00:31] <+BedHome> character tier depends upon tier of play and also on the people playing
[1:00:32] <leith_aziz> More songs!
[1:00:42] <%GarouFGC> I'd Put Chipp and Zato above May. Free.
[1:00:45] <DaKnightWarrior> One more once.
[1:00:49] <+Shishi1205> @athuramn Can't unsee now
[1:00:49] <emptyantics> One more
[1:00:51] <OfficerMods> If may overhead kisses you midscreen she can...totsugeki? Run up and oki?
[1:00:53] <%unclekulikov> GRABBLES!
[1:00:53] <emptyantics> Run it back
[1:00:55] <%CptnCampy61> Nago in purple looks so good
[1:00:55] <%dds333a> Reg loves going for it
[1:00:58] <TheChapyGuy> @TheChapyGuy did he @razielhex? I thought at the start he said he only did his online placement but hasn't played because of the lore videos and his back
[1:00:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> Jesus Christ
[1:00:59] <TheVoltStrike> DUNK
[1:01:01] <$Noponis> you cant low profile dolphin with 6p so you might as well just use faster, less unsafe normals
[1:01:01] <%buff_shiba> Yo. Woolie at the white girl buffet lol
[1:01:01] <+BedHome> may, like sol, is really good if you are new. some simple gameplans you can use that are just, do move
[1:01:02] <+Shishi1205> Reggie?
[1:01:03] <BlackermanZX> holy shit
[1:01:05] <leith_aziz> I feel like Zato is Chipp's 2nd worst matchup after Faust
[1:01:05] <%Shad0wTag> @shishi1205 I cannot get the timing for it. But I don't see myself going off Pot anytime soon
[1:01:06] <Zombrocom> The best thing to beat dolphin is your fastest long range normal
[1:01:06] <JayEarly> absolute top and bottom are easy to see, it‚Äôs the middle that‚Äôs hard to work out
[1:01:09] <leith_aziz> *After Potemkin
[1:01:11] <leith_aziz> oops
[1:01:12] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, this is a really good color palette for nago
[1:01:15] <Asuterisuku> so it takes P2's stage and theme in Local? Online it's all P1
[1:01:16] <%saladin1911> @bedhome 100% There are the tier lists for us scrubs and then there are separate tiers for high-level players for sure
[1:01:21] <JayEarly> remember when EVERYONE said Chipp was bad?
[1:01:21] <+polothegreatest> DUNK
[1:01:23] <%whoisdisgrace> Chipp‚Äôs worst MU is Ky probably
[1:01:27] <didgereedoodah> 5p will beat dolphin a lot of the time
[1:01:27] <sunnythedrunk> All the purple skins in this game are FIRE
[1:01:30] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag Just plink them it works fairly well with plinking
[1:01:31] <leith_aziz> Zato's wall just stops Chipp's pressure and Forhg covers the air
[1:01:39] <$Noponis> potemkin is one of chipp's easiest matchups wtf
[1:01:40] <OfficerMods> everyone is gonna get nerfed while eddie tech keeps getting wilder
[1:01:40] <+R0kushi> nago has a lot of good colors, I love default, the mint green, purple, pink
[1:01:40] <@Menitta> OOOH MAN
[1:01:41] <%dds333a> Neato
[1:01:42] <+Omegasinnocence> That was slick
[1:01:42] <Vaunno> yooooo
[1:01:43] <installvirus> @zenith0111 :facepalm: discussions are fine. if youre gonna be like 'may top 2 or youre an idiot' is ridiculous rn
[1:01:43] <Artemisky> I blinked where the health bar go?
[1:01:44] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag Also try doing the mission for it
[1:01:44] <DaKnightWarrior> Good stuff.
[1:01:45] <leith_aziz> Nice
[1:01:46] <%buff_shiba> Reggie that was godlike
[1:01:50] <somekindofgnome> this is making me wanna play Millia
[1:01:50] <OfficerMods> zato-1 is endgame
[1:01:51] <Zombrocom> Reggie is schmovin
[1:01:51] <+MugenSandan> SPICEY
[1:01:52] <+polothegreatest> hes GAMIN
[1:01:54] <@Menitta> god Roma Cancel is such a better mechanic than what it was in Xrd
[1:01:58] <didgereedoodah> Reggie is V-shifting
[1:02:00] <2thre3> Reggie levelled up HARD

[1:02:25] <+Mr_Misanthropy> I'm switching from nago to sol
[1:02:27] <flyingtarantulaz> amazing set
[1:02:29] <+BedHome> @saladin1911 more granualar than that even! like, as people start to learn a bit, characters with more health who can make more mistakes get better and characters who die with only two or three mistakes get worse, its why chip seems SO BAD and grapplers with high healthbars are often looked at as unfair
[1:02:29] <Vaunno> trade paper defense for a three minute combo
[1:02:37] <%dds333a> Good stuff from Woolz
[1:02:40] <sunnythedrunk> If reggie learns to react to the command grab tho
[1:02:41] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Good thing that fullscreen YRC is no longer a thing

[1:05:12] <Asuterisuku> PC got the rooms patched a few days after PS did.
[1:05:14] <leith_aziz> @jolene_orenji Yes. It's a lot to cover with the Strive story, but basically, Jack-O specifically is now Sol's Girlfriend. They leave together now.

[1:05:54] <Zombrocom> Rooms work fine and have an auto queue function
[1:05:56] <@Menitta> It went from "ROoms are bad" to "on PC rooms are bad' to "rooms are fine"
[1:05:57] <+MugenSandan> @woolieversus Hey Reggie just curious weren't you a Sol main previously?
[1:06:03] <+FoxLex_> Rooms are very inconsistent
[1:06:07] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz they were already bounty hunting and shit beforehand, and she was moreso Aria at the end of Rev. so of course
[1:06:10] <+Fiiib> @WoolieVersus You should set the ost to random to listen to all those jams

[1:07:31] <%buff_shiba> Damn. let me get my ps4 up

[1:08:05] <Deko_> LUL
[1:08:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:08:08] <leith_aziz> @dds333a it's not really the same person. She has Aria's memories, but they are two seperate entities. Since Sol doesn't want to sacrifice Jack-O just to get Aria back and Aria wants Jack-O to live, Jack-O stays alive, and since Jack-O likes Sol and vice-verca, they get together. I actually didnt mind it since they had a lot more interactions than between Sol and Aria
[1:08:08] <%zenith0111> TISK TISK
[1:08:08] <Asuterisuku> PC player base is roughly twice as large as PS.

[1:17:08] <ManiaKarl> reggie with the interference

[1:18:02] <@Solidus_113> where's my octopimp axl
[1:18:07] <VJdarkworld> @leith_aziz i mean, the visuals and how lobbies matchmake are completely separate problems
[1:18:14] <%dds333a> Funny how Axl Rose isn't even a Brit
[1:18:15] <Lanka14> the fact that it drains health while being grabbed is kinda bull
[1:18:17] <+yeknomlive> ahh that's true
[1:18:21] <More_Onn> Never actually fought an axl in this game,how good is he?
[1:18:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> to the pAAARK
[1:18:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> Axl 2
[1:18:34] <Zombrocom> Axl is pretty good, won some tournaments

[1:18:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> we will be orderly
[1:18:38] <+natedrago> rip to everyone who made it
[1:18:39] <lvl10cybermancer> @More_Onn Solid, but difficult
[1:18:47] <%dds333a> Woolie throwing already Kappa
[1:18:48] <+SentaiGarm> to fight woolie, you gotta fight the lobby first
[1:18:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> also i wish there was just a list of names
[1:18:52] <OfficerMods> fuck you i blue roman
[1:18:55] <ManiaKarl> reggie will dominate
[1:18:58] <+FoxLex_> Lobbies totally have no issues what so ever
[1:18:59] <somekindofgnome> A good Axl is annoying, but in a fun way
[1:19:00] <+yeknomlive> @More_Onn pretty solid
[1:19:00] <ullyzeez> woolie please
[1:19:06] <leith_aziz> @VJdarkworld What does that have to do with what I said? I just meant Arcsys always making a big thing out of the lobbies, when a simple matchmaking would do just fine (keep the tower system though. Thats dope)
[1:19:08] <TheDr0t> room code is ieoqpl
[1:19:08] <ManiaKarl> please woolie
[1:19:09] <JayEarly> He‚Äôs good and also no one knows the matchup right now
[1:19:09] <Arancet> oh, yeah, if you and reg are switching, the queue wont work, sorry
[1:19:09] <CrimsonContrast> you can change to rematch
[1:19:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> east coast somewhere in the 50's
[1:19:12] <SpookyBeef7> Nah, you're good, it's just ArcSys refused to listen to people and fix the lobby system.
[1:19:14] <+JollyrogerVG> Can you not change characters while in queue?
[1:19:15] <JayEarly> get your easy wins
[1:19:16] <%Th3rd3> we might need to rent a park tho TPFufun

[1:33:50] <+yeknomlive> trumpets are a magnet to your opponent
[1:33:52] <%zenith0111> Throws are all 2 frame which is also in the range of Sols 5k
[1:33:58] <+Fiiib> Deb's Faust Sol combo is whack and hype as fuck
[1:33:58] <+cubbywolf> there are good faust players Im sure but idk if they play online LUL
[1:34:08] <kikoeru_san> you can crouch the 5K from Sol
[1:34:10] <xuaf2> Faust always does his bhest
[1:34:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> has Woolie given up on Nago?

[1:45:35] <dustworthmain> nago has a full screen overhead with RC

[1:45:51] <%dds333a> Neato
[1:45:54] <+Shishi1205> @2thre3 I mean because he lacks double jumo/air dash
[1:45:54] <leith_aziz> I will say, this is a much cooler Ram design than her Xrd one. It kinda looks like a Sailror outfit at least, which is charming
[1:45:55] <%athuramn> @maniakarl that was stupidly sexist just now. check yourself
[1:46:01] <JayEarly> @ksdm they can‚Äôt unrelease it now

[1:59:54] <drefizz> @Reckless_Rob shes in her late 20s
[1:59:55] <+cubbywolf> SECRET JAPANESE IN KOREA?
[1:59:55] <LorcaNomad> because being japanese in GG makes you super OP

[1:59:58] <VJdarkworld> May got friendzoned by Johnny Sadge
[1:59:58] <FatherFauna> Secretly? TOTUSEGI üê¨
[2:00:00] <%zenith0111> SECRET KOREAN
[2:00:00] <%Major_Lee_> Secret Japanese vs Secret Korean
[2:00:00] <%Th3rd3> RC character select
[2:00:04] <%egressanon> woolie almost played as a GIRL crisis averted
[2:00:06] <Reckless_Rob> @drefizz Yeah shes a little girl
[2:00:06] <MBDiana1> shes japanese and wants johnny's... ship
[2:00:12] <+cubbywolf> imagine if woolie wasnt a punch girl
[2:00:14] <FatherFauna> fuck misspelled
[2:00:14] <%Shad0wTag> SECRET WHALE CROSS UP
[2:00:15] <%dds333a> @teelor32 yes
[2:00:16] <2thre3> Not so little anymore
[2:00:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> shoulda clucthed it out with millia woolz Kappa
[2:00:19] <+yeknomlive> the korean character hides in a robot
[2:00:24] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @emptyantics
[2:00:29] <@Menitta> I remember at first I hated May's redesign. I came around eventually. Its good
[2:00:32] <+MTLxSpider> people not leaving after their game ü§î
[2:00:36] <+cubbywolf> one of us chat... is a korean
[2:00:38] <OfficerMods> I want robo may to be real just to see the contrived reason why she exists in the lore
[2:00:39] <+cubbywolf> and no way can we tell
[2:00:39] <drefizz> Can't cause of models
[2:00:42] <leith_aziz> I do wonder if Arcsys would do actual costumes in this game? I know they're hard to do
[2:00:42] <+Shishi1205> It has now lmao
[2:00:42] <+OmegaZeroX2> Ram doodThirst doodThirst doodThirst
[2:00:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[2:00:46] <+TopTieramisu> cosmetics would take a lot more work in this style
[2:00:46] <Daniel_Is_I> Like Blanka-chan?
[2:00:48] <cromenguy> Hard to do with the artstyle
[2:00:48] <leith_aziz> I think they could try now
[2:00:48] <Lunocura> Hakumen costume for Nago
[2:00:49] <+Shishi1205> your 12 is that
[2:00:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> dr baldhead
[2:00:52] <Onamar> They've said costume changes would be so much work they might as well finish another character
[2:00:52] <Ethrion> jam on certain days of the week
[2:00:56] <%Major_Lee_> Order Sol
[2:00:57] <Starbro_Akarin> Robo Ky!
[2:00:57] <%Afterman_> NOW would be the time to try
[2:00:58] <leith_aziz> Order Sol
[2:00:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> bring back that design
[2:00:58] <Wiiplayah43> @lorcanomad does it? iirc that's a misinterpretation
[2:01:00] <slppanther29> Hio in her full uniform would be cool
[2:01:01] <Brandon__Brando> robo ky
[2:01:01] <%jinking79> like Rev 2 had Order Sol and Young Ky Models
[2:01:01] <+yeknomlive> robo may
[2:01:02] <%Irridium> GIVE ME VENOM IN HIS BAKER OUTFIT
[2:01:02] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> ORDER SOL
[2:01:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> little changes could be doable
[2:01:04] <More_Onn> Too bad they'll probably never be god tier skins like skullgirls
[2:01:05] <%dds333a> It sure would
[2:01:05] <leith_aziz> Order Sol would looks so good
[2:01:05] <@Menitta> The way the lighting and animations work, it's as much as making a new sprite in a sprite based game so they might as well make a new character
[2:01:06] <slppanther29> *Gio
[2:01:06] <scrublord009> @MTLxSpider american don't respect the queue
[2:01:08] <+sundayafternoon1> They did for rev 2
[2:01:10] <+Brunocarvalhoc> drug dealer chipp
[2:01:10] <juxtest> Sol but hes backwards
[2:01:12] <+cubbywolf> seeing all the DBFZ mods, I dont think making changes to a model is that hard to ask for
[2:01:13] <+Niethil> helmet off pot might be possible since he has a whole head modeled underneath
[2:01:15] <FatherFauna> I NEED BAKER OUTFIT VENOM
[2:01:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Big sword vs...2 big swords
[2:01:18] <+Das_Prints> Apparently they don‚Äôt do much in the way of new clothes due to how the animation system works for this artstyle
[2:01:19] <+Meathands> I would love to see Potemkin with the slave collar back on
[2:01:19] <+MTLxSpider> thats fine
[2:01:21] <+ribnal> Dr. Baldhead
[2:01:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> if this is a real ram this ram will use laser super than rc to move through it
[2:01:24] <+MTLxSpider> ill just bully woolie offline one day
[2:01:25] <+sundayafternoon1> Didn‚Äôt chip have the Christmas outfit
[2:01:29] <+yeknomlive> somebody just released an alphonse mod for potempkin
[2:01:32] <+cubbywolf> too much 5p
[2:01:35] <%dds333a> DOKO MITERU
[2:01:36] <T_Sasquatch> I wish we could just recolor anything like in tekken 7
[2:01:37] <OfficerMods> I wouldn't even be suprised if we get chaos ky
[2:01:41] <%jolene_orenji> @meathands boy that sounds fucked out of contexy
[2:01:43] <mental_mashup> merry chippsmas
[2:01:45] <+Das_Prints> Which is why they mostly just do recolors
[2:01:46] <%jolene_orenji> *context
[2:01:46] <emptyantics> Chipp in a Strider cosplay Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:01:47] <Saltmeisterr> Ram's theme...
[2:01:49] <Wiiplayah43> @more_onn why the assumption? this game's designs are great
[2:01:51] <leith_aziz> @Das_Prints We know. We're just wondering if they might go the extra way this time
[2:01:52] <%hologram_sam> clean
[2:01:54] <NotHereToStream> no one punishing the command dash huh
[2:01:55] <+R0kushi> potemkin eva 01 mod is goated
[2:01:55] <hamahiroyuki> well she does hides in the robot but everyone knows the robot is korean. does that still counts as a secret korean?
[2:01:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> gottem
[2:01:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> saving the burst? hmm
[2:02:11] <@Menitta> I do think there should at least be some kind of color edit mode
[2:02:14] <leith_aziz> @hamahiroyuki its more "secret gender"
[2:02:15] <@Menitta> That'd be fun
[2:02:17] <+sundayafternoon1> Woolie one sword is fake pressure you can just dash out
[2:02:24] <@Menitta> Blazblue had it
[2:02:24] <NotHereToStream> melty blood is getting colour edit mode
[2:02:28] <doctordinkus> yo whomst else is bangin' the Kidz bop 20th anniversary re-release
[2:02:31] <Hericknhx> @Menitta they ney Melty is getting one
[2:02:32] <@Menitta> Oh cool
[2:02:33] <+Das_Prints> @leith_aziz some might not know so it‚Äôs worth stating but fair point it‚Äôd be cool to see them put the effort in.
[2:02:38] <+cubbywolf> dont give in yet
[2:02:42] <OfficerMods> might as well go nuts
[2:02:44] <%hologram_sam> unless>>
[2:02:44] <leith_aziz> Zato in a coat, Xrd Millia...
[2:02:45] <+Shishi1205> Dont stay near the sword in the wall you can escape

[2:18:03] <Gregorhasjoined> Caught those buttons
[2:18:06] <+Strelok608> @hassanico2 he's not supposed to be which is why that guy lost
[2:18:12] <leith_aziz> @hassanico2 Ky is an all-rounder, or a shoto
[2:18:12] <AlphaRayAllen> I was worried about Nago in the beginning but the character is really good
[2:18:13] <%egressanon> @menitta pathetic
[2:18:14] <hassanico2> Yeah that makes sense
[2:18:15] <MoistInkorporated> It actually does more damage
[2:18:17] <SidetrackedGamer> Good games
[2:18:17] <%gratedjuice> That mask is so cool
[2:18:18] <$lumporr> the bonus is not dying
[2:18:18] <VJdarkworld> @hassanico2 hes a Shoto monkaS

[2:18:28] <hassanico2> Like my favorite Shoto, Kazuya Kappa
[2:18:30] <+Shishi1205> more range too
[2:18:31] <delightmare_> wish ky did a touch more dmg
[2:18:36] <$lumporr> higher damage and way crazier range
[2:18:36] <crimsonsaens> @hassanico2 He's an aggressive shoto with a focus on long pokes
[2:18:36] <Saltmeisterr> AND more range
[2:18:40] <+pectusumbra> You want a feeding frenzy
[2:18:41] <tollyx> frames get better too
[2:18:45] <MoistInkorporated> you get more life too
[2:18:47] <crassletter> 1 free blood normal
[2:18:50] <%jepupu> A longer succ and a HKD
[2:18:51] <VJdarkworld> @hassanico2 Kappa
[2:18:54] <Zbyrd0961> significantly better at high blood
[2:18:54] <imNoggin> On the sword buttons, in particular.
[2:18:55] <%egressanon> yeah woolie sometimes you wanna get bloody just for the normals
[2:18:56] <$lumporr> impossible to get in as Giovanna
[2:19:00] <Saltmeisterr> his normals
[2:19:00] <+yeknomlive> yeah. ive seen his sword punish right through gunflame
[2:19:05] <Zombrocom> His heavy normals
[2:19:05] <+sandwichtaker> HS gets more range
[2:19:06] <+Tucker0603> range makes sense, he hungy
[2:19:07] <crimsonsaens> Blood empowered normals get more range, power, and frames
[2:19:07] <+Shishi1205> normals become good
[2:19:16] <emptyantics> Havent seen any Giovanna‚Äôs :(
[2:19:17] <mr_sups> It's why you want the Blood up, but not too much
[2:19:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> how many rams
[2:19:19] <umm_idunno> it;s for his sword normals i think
[2:19:23] <More_Onn> Wait I did not know abt the better frames, damn
[2:19:25] <$KinggOfCarbs> Gotta edge yourself for plus frames
[2:19:26] <@Solidus_113> Not a single Gio yet
[2:19:28] <crimsonsaens> *better frames
[2:19:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> and i KNOW we aint gonna see any zato-1

[2:20:01] <+MasterSugarBear> Bless
[2:20:05] <+Das_Prints> Also a few moves get better frames and some stuff like your HS moves can be combo into now from 2S
[2:20:08] <AlphaRayAllen> jH is such a good button for millia
[2:20:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I would have to plug my ps4 back in, we would get some REAL CHIPP SNENANIGANS
[2:20:10] <Octopimp> (jaws theme plays in the distance)
[2:20:11] <+Shishi1205> banger

[2:30:48] <jmepik> @jepupu i see
[2:30:56] <Sol_Install> hook says "this game sucks" most of the damn time he plays a game
[2:31:04] <+CounterBeard> God Faust is so goofy I love it.
[2:31:05] <GeltonZ> @hassanico2 Gotcha. I know that feeling. That's me with Ramlethal and May actually. Faust was actually working okay for me.
[2:31:05] <hassanico2> BTW any reason why Faust went from goofy to creepy

[2:31:27] <hassanico2> LUL understandable
[2:31:30] <%TubeMan642> Yeah Faust!
[2:31:31] <+Shishi1205> @hassanico2 maybe the ingame files say something about it
[2:31:32] <+jerkhov> the pandemic was hard on faust
[2:31:33] <%Shad0wTag> !MOTIVATED
[2:31:33] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag 2241 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:31:33] <+saltpiggu> Air dust is a good counter to jump item
[2:31:36] <+M08Xrd> Woolie what even happened to Faust in the lore?
[2:31:36] <%Juriasu> Faust is rough if you don't know what he can do actually
[2:31:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> MAKE HIS JAB FASTER
[2:31:40] <Man_in_the_Red> @shishi1205 stull nothing
[2:31:41] <Sol_Install> Not yet
[2:31:43] <%zenith0111> @hassanico2 Hes working with his paitents killer after being tricked into creating the perfect medicine
[2:31:44] <+M08Xrd> Oh shit
[2:31:47] <Man_in_the_Red> we checked
[2:31:49] <leith_aziz> The glossary makes it sound like Mental scars

[2:31:52] <@Menitta> @Hericknhx lmaoooooooooo
[2:31:52] <+UnfilteredComic> Hes just been chilling with Chrous too much
[2:31:53] <leith_aziz> no idea
[2:31:54] <Sol_Install> Story Update 2 maybe
[2:31:54] <+Veruveto> he doesn't show up in the story at all too
[2:31:54] <+egalitarian696969> you mean his serial killer roots
[2:31:55] <+jerkhov> cuz it looks cool
[2:31:57] <+M08Xrd> NO REASON
[2:31:58] <+Veruveto> might show up in Another Story
[2:32:01] <Talanaer> wasn't he always weird?
[2:32:01] <+yeknomlive> is that why he's obsessed with flowers and clovers
[2:32:02] <%andrewofbob> How do we know there isn't more than one Faust?
[2:32:03] <Octopimp> who knows :)
[2:32:04] <VJdarkworld> im betting sumthin with happy chaos monkaS
[2:32:05] <2thre3> He's regressing into Dr. Baldhead
[2:32:05] <leith_aziz> I think its held for Story DLC
[2:32:05] <crimsonsaens> @hassanico2 I heard he attached some of Zappa's skin to himself to create a cure for Zappa, but the game just says he returned to his roots
[2:32:06] <%eanscrale> those are some funky roots
[2:32:06] <Ozavic> I want his old look, even as a DLC
[2:32:07] <iheartmota> Most likely later. He's hanging out wtih Cronos
[2:32:08] <Hericknhx> @Menitta it's the truth LUL
[2:32:10] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus @hassanico2 I think he's just kinda...broke. Last I recall he had a BIG revelation about how fucked the Japanese people are.
[2:32:10] <+OmegaZeroX2> @nycrownlessking Yo Crownless doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro doodGood doodSweet doodTerror doodNuts ride26Calc mom0kaMythradab
[2:32:12] <Agami23> i think its just that he is losing more and more sanity
[2:32:13] <@Menitta> it is!
[2:32:14] <More_Onn> He's still hanging with chronus tho
[2:32:15] <YVector26> Yeah, I hope they'll address this DansGame
[2:32:15] <+M08Xrd> It is cooler
[2:32:15] <neroforte177> overtime as a doctor Fucked him up
[2:32:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean
[2:32:16] <+Niethil> @WoolieVersus it's likely going to be addressed in Another Story
[2:32:19] <%JaseAdrift> AND IT IS COOLER
[2:32:20] <%saladin1911> Is TheBestaban in chat? You just beat my ass GGs

[2:32:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he returned...to himself
[2:32:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> the last time we saw him he was walking around with one of the council
[2:32:27] <Man_in_the_Red> @andrewofbob you think theres 2 10 foot tall doctors that resurect people
[2:32:27] <leith_aziz> It has to be for the Story DLC
[2:32:27] <SpookyBeef7> There is some dialogue in Faust's Arcade mode that implies he went too hard trying to save people, but that's about it.
[2:32:30] <hassanico2> Right, I saw the last lore episodes yesterday so... yeah.
[2:32:34] <GeltonZ> I just want Fanny to come back and give him a hug.

[2:57:05] <%bmoral64> I feel like Nago's super doesn't do very much damage
[2:57:05] <+Shishi1205> Is it because its too many hits?

[2:57:31] <+GelatinBoi> truly we live in a society
[2:57:32] <tollyx> it def should've been a wallbreak
[2:57:32] <Drunkengen> you did it in a weird angle
[2:57:32] <+cubbywolf> that was a raw super right?
[2:57:33] <%zenith0111> MICRO WALKED MESSED IT UP
[2:57:33] <Octopimp> yeah i dunno why that happened
[2:57:33] <VJdarkworld> woolie now pain-peko
[2:57:34] <%wolfofsound> @Octopimp nj
[2:57:37] <Zombrocom> If you hit him too high in the air it does that
[2:57:37] <2thre3> IDK why he went backwards
[2:57:37] <+Niethil> @WoolieVersus you were like a smidgen all from the wall break
[2:57:38] <Bulsokadoo> looked like a kill if it had broken wall
[2:57:39] <Drunkengen> to where he can get out of the wall
[2:57:41] <+cubbywolf> he did go backwards
[2:57:42] <VJdarkworld> GG
[2:57:42] <+Niethil> away*
[2:57:44] <WakeUpThrow> Octo was too high up, probably?
[2:57:45] <DrSomnia> Someone clip it for Will It Kill
[2:57:46] <+cubbywolf> was that a bug then?
[2:57:48] <floralkami> @bmoral64 most supers don't do much damage at the end of rounds because of GUTS scaling
[2:57:53] <+yusefHD> Save the clip woolie
[2:57:54] <+cubbywolf> does it always stage transition?
[2:57:55] <+yeknomlive> it def wouldve killed if the wall break happened
[2:57:57] <+sundayafternoon1> @drsomnia lmao
[2:57:59] <Zombrocom> close slash super would have worked
[2:58:00] <Octopimp> anytime!
[2:58:00] <he1lhydra> @WoolieVersus nago specifically has that happen when you super with them right above you, you walked forward just a bit
[2:58:01] <+yeknomlive> but wow that's crazy
[2:58:12] <drefizz> UH OH back tot he lab again
[2:58:12] <Sol_Install> @he1lhydra yea
[2:58:14] <+cubbywolf> it wouldnt have killed either way but a wall splat would give him hardest knockdown
[2:58:15] <floralkami> @bmoral64 they are more meter dumps to end rounds or combo extensions

[2:58:40] <T_Sasquatch> ofcourse reggie is millia
[2:58:42] <+ttvp> Killer Gio
[2:58:43] <Zombrocom> Oh shit its foxlex
[2:58:46] <Sol_Install> BUT you get a combo with 6H
[2:58:46] <+cubbywolf> so was that a crossup?
[2:58:47] <trustiano> the dev
[2:58:48] <Kusano123> tip of the blade is sometimes good
[2:58:49] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Just the tip
[2:58:50] <%zenith0111> The tipper no combo super is actually super good
[2:58:51] <sleepy_pixels> Dev?

[2:58:56] <objektivespieleanalyse> The sweetspot is cool for combos afterwards tho
[2:58:57] <WakeUpThrow> @DrSomnia lmao Entire chat would get bankrupt
[2:58:58] <%zenith0111> Its even optimal
[2:58:59] <+gitgouda> this is a no tip zone
[2:58:59] <dustworthmain> you still get a combo with the tip. you can pick it up
[2:59:00] <Zombrocom> The sweetspot actually does more damage
[2:59:01] <Saltmeisterr> he's roy lol
[2:59:04] <aka_Jigawatt> the tip Kreygasm
[2:59:08] <%egressanon> millia is cool and all but filia is at least 4x cooler
[2:59:10] <BluBox> It's funny how that sweetspot can lead to tod combos

[3:00:13] <%zenith0111> This isnt Break a Spell
[3:00:20] <TawnyMonarch> FD is a must against gio imo, to get the space to put a jab in there
[3:00:23] <Zombrocom> Pretty sure it is
[3:00:25] <+cubbywolf> he said to the song break a spell
[3:00:27] <floralkami> POLAR BEAR GOING HYPE
[3:00:27] <+yusefHD> @WoolieVersus please tweet a pic of that rave outfit, subreddit would go insane lmao
[3:00:27] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:00:29] <+Shishi1205> Gio dashgrab is sooo good
[3:00:30] <%zenith0111> Oh wait it super is lmao
[3:00:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> Cybergoth Woolie is a wild ass idea to visualize
[3:00:32] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Remember to drink plenty of water when you rave, chat
[3:00:35] <+natedrago> Gio vs Mil is a fun match up
[3:00:37] <%zenith0111> I cant here over the Thuds
[3:00:38] <+cubbywolf> way to be the one guy
[3:00:41] <%zenith0111> hear*
[3:00:42] <+yeknomlive> more burgers in the background
[3:00:50] <floralkami> @fuqboislim you don't have to visualize; there are photos out there
[3:00:51] <%egressanon> Yooo
[3:00:53] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag gifted a Tier 1 sub to Octopimp! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:00:53] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag is paying forward the Gift they got from MrKerb to Octopimp! 
[3:00:54] <Grim1952> Nice
[3:00:59] <VJdarkworld> 6P FOR LYFE
[3:01:03] <+cubbywolf> her floor moves are air moves
[3:01:05] <+cubbywolf> kinda
[3:01:07] <+Damien_Kova> @WoolieVersus 6P counters the spiral
[3:01:08] <xxxathanasxxx> 6P wins vs dash
[3:01:10] <+FuqBoiSlim> @floralkami on God?
[3:01:15] <ElPlasa> ouch
[3:01:15] <Zombrocom> You need to use 6P in this matchup
[3:01:20] <+cubbywolf> Gio is the character to 6p
[3:01:35] <+cubbywolf> does it counter the dash?
[3:01:42] <+cubbywolf> spam that shit like shes a dolphin
[3:01:44] <someyounguy1> 6p to counter drill is defo predictive
[3:01:45] <Zombrocom> You can react with it
[3:01:46] <%hologram_sam> 6P counters the flippy overhead
[3:01:51] <ferbeholds> Hy Woolie wich charactr do you dislik playing against @WoolieVersus
[3:01:52] <%TheBesteban> She can delay 5H to blow up a lot of that though, so have to use it sparingly
[3:01:52] <dustworthmain> you can react to spiral if you look for it
[3:02:08] <+Kisabuza> Nago doesnt have anti airs
[3:02:08] <Zombrocom> You can react to drill and flippy with 6P, the invul is starts up fast
[3:02:09] <Brandon__Brando> its a read
[3:02:10] <+cubbywolf> well 6p counters spiral and the crossup kick so just throw it
[3:02:13] <floralkami> @fuqboislim bro, there's PLENTY of old, would-be embarrassing photos of Woolie at Christmas parties, lol. some are in the stream wait lobby
[3:02:18] <$KinggOfCarbs> Just stare at gio, drill animation is give away
[3:02:22] <+FoxLex_> Her dash is not 6P able
[3:02:27] <Daniel_Is_I> The flip has 30 STARTUP FRAMES
[3:02:28] <xxxathanasxxx> Considering how swords in this game have hurt boxes, 6P is very good
[3:02:28] <+cubbywolf> they are all reads but if you know her blockstrings
[3:02:35] <Zombrocom> You can react to the drill with 6P
[3:02:38] <+RegularCore> A faust?
[3:02:39] <sunnythedrunk> Dash is 6p able
[3:02:40] <LacromD> Vs Gio is tricky cuz she can cancel the dash into backdash into dash
[3:02:43] <+RegularCore> an endangered species
[3:02:47] <+MTLxSpider> Yes
[3:02:49] <+FoxLex_> Drill and Flip yes
[3:02:50] <WakeUpThrow> Good ol Laust
[3:02:50] <+MTLxSpider> Drill and flip
[3:02:52] <+MTLxSpider> thats it
[3:02:53] <+FoxLex_> Dash hell no
[3:02:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> all may players are bad people
[3:02:56] <Sol_Install> drill and flip yes
[3:02:57] <%hologram_sam> drill on the startup but not once she's in the drill
[3:02:58] <+Damien_Kova> Can react to flip and drill.
[3:03:00] <Sol_Install> dash no
[3:03:07] <VJdarkworld> just react bro 4Head 4Head
[3:03:10] <floralkami> nice
[3:03:10] <Zombrocom> Lab it
[3:03:10] <2thre3> Drill yes - Flip yes - Dash no, Dash 2k HELL no
[3:03:11] <%TheBesteban> "Just 6P, bro" as I then throw the hell out of you for days
[3:03:12] <+Damien_Kova> Flip is harder to react, though.
[3:03:13] <+MTLxSpider> also jte pete
[3:03:17] <LacromD> Just 6p bro 4Head
[3:03:20] <huskarl_zap> Beter colors
[3:03:20] <+FoxLex_> Whoever says you can 6P dash, shut uo
[3:03:25] <T_Sasquatch> oof
[3:03:26] <%hologram_sam> fr
[3:03:28] <+Taisuru> Scary Faust makes me sad, I really wanna know why he looks like this in this game
[3:03:39] <+Shishi1205> It does not
[3:03:43] <+cubbywolf> those buddahs need to go to space and i accept that
[3:03:45] <Grim1952> This is the flavor
[3:03:46] <someyounguy1> right?! the story mode is like, ignoring the stages and changes to characters, its so weird
[3:03:47] <%zenith0111> I think the glossary explains then
[3:03:48] <Vaunno> these stages built different
[3:03:49] <BluBox> Where is the White House stage?
[3:03:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> even the flying buddha stage woolie?
[3:03:52] <+cubbywolf> mogu mogu
[3:03:53] <Sol_Install> I'm waiting on Story mode Update 2
[3:03:53] <@Menitta> ok I'm back have I missed an Ino
[3:03:54] <xxxathanasxxx> Guess i'll just lab it and see for myself
[3:03:54] <%townzzzzz> hell is a place
[3:03:55] <+yeknomlive> @Taisuru specially with his theme near the end sounds kinda sad
[3:04:00] <Zombrocom> Not a single ino
[3:04:01] <+Fiiib> Little Nightmare lookinass stage
[3:04:02] <+Shishi1205> no @Menitta
[3:04:03] <+FuqBoiSlim> @taisuru maybe he'd constipated.
[3:04:04] <YVector26> Yeah, I hoped they would explain it a bit but hey, I don't mind
[3:04:07] <Uselesswhitenoise> has woolie given his character theme song tier list yet
[3:04:08] <scrublord009> Some of them are locations that make sens
[3:04:11] <+OmegaZeroX2> @blubox probably DLC ride26Lul ride26Lul ride26Lul
[3:04:12] <Vaunno> vore
[3:04:14] <%wolfofsound> like luffy
[3:04:14] <+cubbywolf> Fausts like to grab on wake up so watch out for that
[3:04:15] <@Menitta> Is ANYONE an Ino in the line right now
[3:04:17] <+Shishi1205> No I-no and no Chip
[3:04:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> all may players are bad people because the instant that character get's nerfed they will abandon ship
[3:04:23] <OfficerMods> millia needs a faster jab
[3:04:26] <OfficerMods> thats all
[3:04:27] <Vaunno> no,
[3:04:30] <SpookyBeef7> Bah.
[3:04:32] <Zombrocom> No ino no chipp, no nago mirror
[3:04:32] <point4effort> Hell no her jabs are fine
[3:04:33] <floralkami> if it had a hitbox, it would

[3:18:25] <+cubbywolf> nice dash out
[3:18:26] <@Menitta> I just prefer stick since I got a Madcatz TE2

[3:18:36] <%Stonesoul_> get 'em regger
[3:18:36] <objektivespieleanalyse> Really? I bought the PC version because I noticed how much trouble I had to do quartercircles on PS4
[3:18:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RyTYoung d pad
[3:18:45] <Jetsfantasy> I adopted the hitbox a few years ago after my TE2, it's so much better on my hands
[3:18:50] <+R0kushi> I use analog stick on dualshock and feel dumb :(
[3:18:50] <+MTLxSpider> always use button dash
[3:18:51] <Magicferret> With an RC and dash macro button its easier than ever to play with a pad.
[3:18:51] <+M08Xrd> Button Dash is godlike
[3:18:51] <Meltgar> D-PAD here, i hate stick
[3:18:53] <%Shad0wTag> Reggie is doing pretty great
[3:18:54] <Finchit> Have you tried the Virtua fighter 5 rerelease?
[3:18:54] <+MTLxSpider> its free backdash
[3:18:55] <+R0kushi> pad doesnt work for me
[3:18:57] <SpookyMooks> When i get a stick ill probably use it, but for now pad is doing just fine
[3:19:02] <GarbageNirvana> If it's a four or five button game I try to stick to pad just because it's generally easier to pick up
[3:19:03] <+Shishi1205> dust burst rc and dash on shoulders for me
[3:19:06] <Uselesswhitenoise> im too poor to get a stick for one game
[3:19:09] <dustworthmain> 1 button backdash is really strong too
[3:19:14] <GarbageNirvana> And so far I've been able to play Strive on pad pretty good
[3:19:17] <More_Onn> Have any of ya'll ever played a millia with a bad connection? The rollback AI does not know what to do
[3:19:18] <2thre3> @R0kushi Always go with whatever works for YOU man.
[3:19:18] <%zenith0111> I use analog stick because my DMC brain cant understand a dpad for movement :)
[3:19:19] <+M08Xrd> R2 to dash is intuitive in every game
[3:19:21] <Uselesswhitenoise> im an axl main anyway

[3:19:53] <%Irridium> @saladin1911 but throws are strong all things considered. goes through most attacks. just gotta make sure they're vulnerable else you whiff
[3:19:54] <+Fiiib> also dash macro's help

[3:24:01] <+TheMainManAfrika> how did they even get the line to not be a giant mass of chaos
[3:24:04] <+RegularCore> Sin's name is dumb

[3:24:48] <+RegularCore> Xeno351 bandana ky
[3:24:48] <CryptusMaximus> I'm extremely guilty of playing cool characters over good ones LUL

[3:24:51] <FatherFauna> I downloaded so many mods today
[3:24:52] <%Shad0wTag> @saladin1911 some people went to other cabs to fave each other but no one has looped round yet
[3:24:53] <neroforte177> @RegularCore "why you name him that?" "Sleept with a demon"
[3:24:54] <+yeknomlive> maybe on sale or something. those mods are pretty cool
[3:24:55] <BoxNavy> you can
[3:24:55] <+MTLxSpider> yes
[3:24:57] <drefizz> yes
[3:24:57] <Arancet> yes
[3:24:58] <+Tornix> yes
[3:24:59] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[3:24:59] <Uselesswhitenoise> seems silly to buy an entire game agian imo just for a different platform
[3:24:59] <%Irridium> Axl got that McDonalds mod fuckin' love it

[3:25:02] <+Taisuru> B- woolie
[3:25:02] <Vaunno> we live in a counterpick society

[3:25:03] <Arancet> steam supports ps5
[3:25:04] <WeijiBeng> to counter pick you gotta be a beast in game tho its impressive tbh
[3:25:04] <+Tornix> Steam compatible
[3:25:05] <dustworthmain> steam handles it
[3:25:05] <leomuratore> What do you think of the new tracks, Woolie?
[3:25:07] <Karhax> Steam handles the inputs, no need for drivers
[3:25:09] <+Davos_Southway> steam has it by default
[3:25:09] <jmepik> steam does it pretty much on its own
[3:25:09] <TopTierHarley> no crossplay
[3:25:10] <FatherFauna> The most recent Ram mod oh my god
[3:25:11] <2thre3> It just works on Steam @WoolieVersus
[3:25:11] <drefizz> Steam supports the dualsense
[3:25:12] <+RegularCore> neroforte177 exactly, that still messed up
[3:25:13] <Jetsfantasy> Mod it to hell and back too
[3:25:14] <BoxNavy> SourPls

[3:25:22] <+tkzhyon> Is pad viable in gg? If so that‚Äôs sick
[3:25:24] <+makouzer> no crossplay on launch, they might add it along the line tho
[3:25:28] <+RyTYoung> Imagine Roman Cancels with trigger resistance NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:25:28] <%andrewofbob> @Uselesswhitenoise And yet I bought Skullgirls twice
[3:25:29] <+M08Xrd> I AM SUBHUMAAAAAN

[3:54:29] <+MeyB_7> imma hafta watch that match like 5 times
[3:54:33] <Monkeyweed21> @floralkami oh the crop top works, its just got a LITTLE too much guilty gear flavor to be "normal"
[3:54:42] <+M08Xrd> Super Real
[3:54:53] <$lumporr> that's the canon Axl

[3:55:28] <sunnythedrunk> meaties are pretty tricky on not good connections too
[3:55:35] <+heyitsjayordan> you have to be tight with your meaties or you will get 2 frame thrown
[3:55:37] <floralkami> @monkeyweed21 well of course. I'm saying you could find items irl that look very similar, and match them into something presentable irl
[3:55:37] <critfumble_> @TawnyMonarch ayyy

[3:56:37] <+MeyB_7> They forgot to clean the stations so the you cant initialize the match
[3:56:39] <+fizzguy47> @ex_shuffle Reversal on wakeup is super tight in this game, it seems
[3:56:41] <Monkeyweed21> if you fear the counter you lose
[3:56:42] <VJdarkworld> someone put gum into the coin slot Sadge
[3:56:44] <YVector26> Speen PogChamp
[3:56:47] <+Shishi1205> if you hit the counter from far its ok I think

[3:57:53] <+Veruveto> that's a button
[3:57:56] <%Kaito_Cam> Wave Check
[3:58:00] <+MeyB_7> He stole the tech immediately and didn't get the throw
[3:58:08] <he1lhydra> fun fact: anji has the highest guts in the game
[3:58:08] <Zombrocom> Anji has the highest guts in the game
[3:58:10] <critfumble_> my beautiful kungfu son
[3:58:13] <TawnyMonarch> my man HOLDING the burst
[3:58:22] <+heyitsjayordan> higher than Pot?
[3:58:25] <$lumporr> @he1lhydra what is guts?
[3:58:29] <Zombrocom> Higher than pot, higher than chipp
[3:58:30] <critfumble_> saving that burst for the next set
[3:58:33] <he1lhydra> pot has a high defense modifier
[3:58:33] <+Shishi1205> Anji gotta have them guts to have Baiken
[3:58:36] <+Veruveto> this man is saving burst for next game
[3:58:39] <+heyitsjayordan> @lumporr damage gets reduced the less health you ahve
[3:58:40] <Zombrocom> Pot is only guts 3. Anji is guts FIVE
[3:58:59] <+heyitsjayordan> well he kinda seems like a shitty character so its what ever I guess haha
[3:59:01] <YVector26> Is Dust a good move to use on a opponent whos getting up?
[3:59:03] <%710jd> 710jd subscribed with Prime. 
[3:59:08] <+MeyB_7> Bro i was about to say why didint you airdash back in after burst but I realized nago dosent get it
[3:59:16] <$lumporr> @heyitsjayordan how i look up table
[3:59:22] <+Solcubus> if they are conditioned to block low then sure
[3:59:22] <+yeknomlive> yeah and chipp has 4

[4:00:35] <+heyitsjayordan> i can't believe he didn't block that burst, I've been playing GG since 1991 and that burst was so obvious anyone and their grandmothers could've blocked that
[4:00:36] <+Shishi1205> GG XX music goated
