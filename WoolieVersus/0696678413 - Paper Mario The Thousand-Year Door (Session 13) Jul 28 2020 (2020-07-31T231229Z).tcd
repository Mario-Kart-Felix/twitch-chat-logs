[0:00:27] <Skeletonmanners> yea audio in the pre stream sounded terrible
[0:00:27] <atomicxdj> yup, no bass to the sound
[0:00:28] <RichochetForce> Yep, no bass frequencies at all
[0:00:30] <%Exiliator> Yes, but you sound fine
[0:00:34] <dots4eyes> The music was not sounding full
[0:00:35] <RichochetForce> Nah, you guys sound fine.

[0:03:28] <phantomsleeves> the playlist is nice tho so people don't have to ask
[0:03:28] <%Asuterisuku> Normal PC users don't want 10X.
[0:03:31] <RichochetForce> Possibly
[0:03:31] <+brickwall35> maybe LilV became the tin man
[0:03:32] <+someguy1472> We all appreciate you Woolie.
[0:03:37] <%Asuterisuku> Not when they're dropping x32 support.
[0:03:37] <RichochetForce> Updates typically break shit
[0:03:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Have you ever rebooted and updated?
[0:03:45] <nxflre> gotta tweak
[0:03:48] <%Exiliator> Did you accidentally check the "tinny" checkbox? Kappa

[0:06:54] <time_axis> she did say "dont worry about me" in her letter
[0:06:55] <RichochetForce> Yes
[0:06:58] <%gatorafan> @nintega010 Halo
[0:07:00] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Why does he assume that Mario cares about Peach? She gets kidnapped all the time and is fine

[0:07:02] <Reilata> LUL
[0:07:03] <derap41> Fuck that bitfch

[0:07:10] <%starzo0> who?
[0:07:11] <%Solidnick18> who is peach
[0:07:12] <%eyezehuhh> just like ff15
[0:07:13] <JetpackMcQuack> They have a flakey relationship at best
[0:07:13] <dizimous> I think peach would say as much herself
[0:07:14] <skyheys> Princess Eclair jr
[0:07:15] <cheerfulnpc> Saving girlfriend who's not in immediate danger second to world-ending demon
[0:07:17] <DatAsuna> Vivian is new best girl
[0:07:18] <$mark1247> thanks for the help @DensityD
[0:07:18] <%YakumoYomi> I was under the impression that she just tags along with Beldam, and Beldam is the one that knows how to get to the X-Naut lair
[0:07:19] <phantomsleeves> peach can CHILL shes fine
[0:07:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> If Peach kept that short hair, she would have become priority numero uno
[0:07:21] <thesickestzak> Peach is much more important than a demon beings released 4Head
[0:07:22] <+zooeymainbtw> not even a spoiler tho but yeah you gotta star
[0:07:24] <+MechArch> gamble first
[0:07:27] <%i_heart_gaming> peach can chill

[0:07:43] <Reilata> Just let Bowser rescue her, I'm sure that would work out.
[0:07:44] <lotharrio> I heard One Piece. Confirmed.
[0:07:47] <%gatorafan> Mario has a harem now, does he really need to rescue Peach?

[0:13:06] <+Taglog7> ONE FANDOM
[0:13:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Just got here, did Woolie get spoiled on something?

[0:13:29] <%DensityD> Choo Chooo HypeSideeye
[0:13:30] <huskarl_zap> Halo lore is jusr 40k lore renamed and moved around
[0:13:33] <time_axis> everyone wants to be the first one to say something, even when everyone else knows it and is intentionally staying quiet.
[0:13:34] <nintega010> Hey even as a One Piece fan once you tell me you start I stop talking to you about it.
[0:13:36] <$mark1247> Choo Chooo HypeSign first time being an TIER SUB :)

[0:13:42] <xcel30> i heard the word TOUHOU
[0:13:45] <+Posh_Cat> I like halo to reach & that’s good enough for me
[0:13:45] <derap41> Running in place going Gotta Tell Woolie
[0:13:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cheer500 But Woolie, I have this esoteric knowledge that you don't know and it fills me with the good chemicals to word vomit everything I know as soon as I can.
[0:13:53] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> My genie wish would be to just give everyone the knowledge and ability to be patient
[0:13:55] <%GenericSoda> they gotta powerlevel you for the knowledge
[0:13:56] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @huskarl_zap It's also not as interesting or ambitious.
[0:13:56] <daimon_shaw> Toehoe

[0:14:08] <DianaTheAscian> never will
[0:14:09] <Darkdrill> it will never reach everyone
[0:14:09] <Drusain> You're talking about it on a non-Halo stream LUL
[0:14:10] <%dmcRedgrave> the Souls games are another series where people Just. Can't. Stop.
[0:14:12] <brachydios777> @huskarl_zap Without everything being grimdark(not that that’s a bad thing)
[0:14:12] <DesertPenguin> Because they want to discuss it, but fucking wait
[0:14:17] <%eanscrale> Can't wait for the Wily Beast and Weakest Creature stream.
[0:14:22] <JonnyZeFox> every touhou plot is "let's have a tea party what do you mean she didnt show up? let's blow up that scumbag's house"
[0:14:22] <%GenericSoda> theres always one guy
[0:14:23] <+Posh_Cat> Remember reach cpaxKappa
[0:14:26] <+maenos2> @theycallmenerf touhou as in the shmup
[0:14:28] <DatAsuna> In kotor's case, starting with the game is starting in the middle so there's a lotta old lore to catch
[0:14:30] <%gatorafan> The only time I've seen people take Sonic seriously on the last years it's in the comics. You bring out the comics and the woolieONEGUY s start popping.
[0:14:30] <%Theycallmenerf> @dmcredgrave True, same for MGS.
[0:14:33] <JetpackMcQuack> whipDerp oh well

[0:14:56] <huskarl_zap> @TitaniumDragoonNeo People can like what they want we all love Halo because it was warhammer before we know what it was because it never advertised/
[0:14:57] <%dmcRedgrave> @Theycallmenerf Souls is even worse. When it comes to Souls games people really, REALLY can't control themselves for whatever reason. It's jammed down your throat.
[0:14:59] <brian_peppers1> HALO INFINITE BAD XBOX BAD

[0:19:03] <daimon_shaw> @brachydios777 I guess.
[0:19:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 I think it’s a vocal minority kind of thing, because I know a lot of really cool Halo/Star Wars fans. The Yakuza fandom is also super enthusiastic, so you may have a similar problem if you ever do one of those games. Either way, thanks for the great content, keep on keeping on
[0:19:06] <skyheys> beep beep boop
[0:19:06] <+gollion> I just wanted a conclusion to the current arc in kh3, personally I was happy with the game
[0:19:09] <derap41> they're call Tidus
[0:19:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> I only played Chain of Memories and maybe 1 third of KH3. I don't see the hype.
[0:19:13] <thesickestzak> That's pretty true
[0:19:14] <phantomsleeves> is woolie gonna stream nocturne?

[0:19:25] <%DensityD> how do I enforce emote only chat in real life?
[0:19:26] <%ozmon> Kingdom Hearts has very deep reaching, intricate lore. Kingdom Hearts also has Mickey Mouse. I like Mickey Mouse.
[0:19:27] <%Theycallmenerf> I like Roxas cause his name is cool and I think he has a better design than Sora.
[0:19:30] <DatAsuna> "Yoh I just stole this latop"
[0:19:30] <+zooeymainbtw> you really can't push it on someone
[0:19:32] <skyheys> @derap41 Tidus actually grew up eventually :U
[0:19:34] <$mark1247> @GeneralSCPatton then i suppose you haven't seen gif of the combat of 3 at all

[0:20:08] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:20:10] <%ozmon> LOL
[0:20:17] <brachydios777> The problem with KH’s story is how it’s spread out in different spin offs, prequels, and mobile games
[0:20:18] <nintega010> Man it's fun talking about One Piece. I can't talk to none of my friends besides one until he catches up
[0:20:18] <%dmcRedgrave> Human beings have an urge to share things with others, but a lot of the time people don't appreciate that some things don't want to be shared.
[0:20:18] <CrematedCube> Hype is a bitter drug

[0:21:08] <Dave_VD> It’s fun to share what you love, but there’s always the guy who talks too much about one piece

[0:21:08] <@akuda_bar> @TitaniumDragoonNeo mansplain warhammer to me then
[0:21:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Hence, one guy
[0:21:15] <nxflre> vocal minority

[0:21:19] <Ecliptic_Origins> Yakuza's awesome

[0:21:41] <brian_peppers1> KIRYU-CHAN
[0:21:41] <%Exiliator> I think its a clash of personality types. Most people who "one guy" might very often be in the position of "man I wish someone had told me this earlier, I know! I'll tell everyone so they wont feel the same!", and they probably dont value the "reveal" as much as their opposites.
[0:21:42] <Manmush> onlyfan
[0:21:43] <skyheys> @th3smartalec Well yeah, I asked for 10 pages,not a 100 hour video essay on Roxas
[0:21:45] <%andrex2311> wat?!
[0:21:45] <brachydios777> Certain fandoms can’t stfu about certain things (*cough cough graphics)
[0:21:46] <DianaTheAscian> the people who are one guy will never stop being one guy
[0:21:49] <%doomerskeletor13> I just mean like Yakuza fans love the series so they might spoil something by accident

[0:21:52] <%Druuplays_> I don’t even think it’s a fandom I think it’s just a personality type problem

[0:32:41] <%DensityD> CHESS IS FIXED
[0:32:45] <%DensityD> it's SOLVED
[0:32:47] <%tank7013> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz Ouch, I know the pain. Took me a minute to figure out that that happened. Traveled over every square inch of Colony 9. It's also a really good way to tell that you've missed something
[0:32:48] <%Asuterisuku> Chess is a sloved game.
[0:32:50] <JetpackMcQuack> A few hundred billion I think
[0:32:50] <sparkly_yoyo> disembi
[0:32:50] <TigerClaws12> yea but 5D chess tho
[0:32:51] <+MisterRaffles> What has been your favorite chapter thus far?
[0:32:51] <%Asuterisuku> Go is not.
[0:32:57] <%gatorafan> 2D Chess maybe
[0:32:58] <%eriksdrums> Qu'est-ce-que tu veux dire en secret sur le stream pour confondre les anglos?
[0:32:58] <%ozmon> All Woolie's begin 5D Chess at the same time. It's the Woolie Singularity, that moment is the moment where the multiverse aligns
[0:33:01] <%andrex2311> that's bullshit
[0:33:02] <JonnyZeFox> ohthankgod
[0:33:04] <thekrawler> hear me out, white chocolate tastes nothing like chocolate
[0:33:05] <%andrex2311> :(
[0:33:05] <%DensityD> when will we SOLVE go?
[0:33:06] <+zooeymainbtw> OH NO
[0:33:07] <huskarl_zap> The slav is my favorite opener
[0:33:08] <+AbnormalVoid> it is, but you can still fuck up
[0:33:11] <%krispen_wa> CHESS INFINITE
[0:33:11] <%afronooch> do you want to learn a fucking infinite
[0:33:14] <%SirGO0SE> just play Connect 4 Kappa
[0:33:14] <Drusain> get out of here woolie i want more reggie talks
[0:33:15] <%Asuterisuku> But Reggie didn't tell us his KI main!
[0:33:16] <CappuccinoGuil> There's one surefire way to win at Go and Chess: PUNCH THEIR NOSE
[0:33:16] <Dancenorigins> :(
[0:33:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Chess is just rote memorization
[0:33:19] <+Creggamonsta> Yooo that shirt is fire wolz
[0:33:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:20] <%chosenjuan42> like tic tac toe
[0:33:21] <%Theycallmenerf> I don’t know chess
[0:33:23] <TigerClaws12> someone needs to show Woolie 5D chess
[0:33:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Chess is NOT solved! We have no algorithm for that yet.
[0:33:24] <time_axis> or just, you know, a computer
[0:33:26] <sparkly_yoyo> chess is bullshit
[0:33:27] <+Creggamonsta> thicc queen 4 life
[0:33:27] <+linSP> make the chessboard bigger and boom
[0:33:28] <+AbnormalVoid> people still fuck up tic tac toe
[0:33:28] <derap41> Those are urban myths
[0:33:29] <RichochetForce> This is why computers can become Chess Gods
[0:33:31] <%krispen_wa> But if two people with memories fought
[0:33:31] <DianaTheAscian> so paige can win chess every time?
[0:33:34] <%ozmon> Don't computers still lose chess?
[0:33:34] <sparkly_yoyo> just punch each other
[0:33:35] <%insomniacCoder> not solved
[0:33:39] <CrematedCube> There are more than 10^100 possible states, that's bullshit
[0:33:39] <%Exiliator> Like a computer?
[0:33:42] <KaitlynnHere> Mhmmmmm, not if they’re not smart
[0:33:43] <%GenericSoda> woolie no yoyre going to end up on scrubquotes
[0:33:43] <%DensityD> my memory is a jpeg
[0:33:44] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> @tank7013 that is a good point. until it auto fills I'll know I missed stuff. thanks for the tip🙏🙏🙏
[0:33:46] <%SirGO0SE> arent there people who dont lose to computers ever?
[0:33:50] <%gatorafan> A V Tuber, got it
[0:33:51] <+linSP> beat the chess computer
[0:33:51] <%krispen_wa> BUT WHAT IF TWO COMPUTERS FOUGHT
[0:33:56] <+Creggamonsta> what if you have perfect memory but no strats
[0:34:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Some PC's can literally not lose
[0:34:06] <Aluminar> chess isn't solved
[0:34:06] <%Theycallmenerf> I just wanna play chess in Central Park when it’s sunny.
[0:34:11] <%Exiliator> ...until suddenly its unsolved again
[0:34:14] <time_axis> its probably like tic tac toe where if both people played perfectly it would be a stalemate every time
[0:34:17] <%TheLemuroid> At some point you have to predict the opponent
[0:34:19] <KaitlynnHere> If someone can’t understand chess then it doesn’t matter if they have a perfect memory
[0:34:21] <%DensityD> flaws are fun?
[0:34:24] <%GenericSoda> no way man, people cannot physically react to stuff thar comes out in four frames
[0:34:25] <JetpackMcQuack> thankfully people are garbage
[0:34:26] <sparkly_yoyo> then it gets nerfed
[0:34:26] <penitentpentwitch> And yet the speed of light is too slow
[0:34:32] <DianaTheAscian> flaws = fun
[0:34:32] <%chosenjuan42> Just git gud
[0:34:33] <Supabait> @WoolieVersus i wouldn't say chess is SOLVED per se, we are still coming up with new chess engines that are better than old engines.
[0:34:34] <+AbnormalVoid> if you recognize patterns, you can cut away large swaths of the possible outcomes
[0:34:35] <SomersaultJustice> computers aren't able to hold all possible states in memory, so that's why it's possible to still beat them
[0:34:36] <Zohare> Higher level chess outcomes are draws, computers have different outcomes more often
[0:34:40] <%tank7013> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz Sure thing doodGood
[0:34:41] <%ozmon> Only GO1 can solve fighting games
[0:34:41] <%DensityD> @GenericSoda LUL
[0:34:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> But the speed of light is too slow tho
[0:34:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Win any fighting game with this one trick: TWIST THEIR DICK SwiftRage
[0:34:48] <%krispen_wa> Kara?
[0:34:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Tic Tac Toe is solved. Checkers is solved. Chess is NOT solved.
[0:34:58] <%DensityD> the ol dick twitst
[0:34:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Detroit Become Combo
[0:35:11] <Aluminar> chess is solvable due to finite states, but there is no current hardware that's capable of doing it within a person's lifespan
[0:35:13] <brachydios777> @penitentpentwitch God that panel is sumb dumb bullishit, I love it
[0:35:15] <+thunka10> then we reach 20XX where everyone is afraid to move
[0:35:22] <+linSP> parry the parry
[0:35:26] <RichochetForce> Yup
[0:35:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ICH NI SAN
[0:35:31] <derap41> Salty bets have perfect characters that are super boring
[0:35:35] <%chosenjuan42> but disconnect their controller
[0:35:40] <atomicxdj> TicTacToe has no balance patch yet
[0:35:42] <%jiggy_snipe> infinite tic tac toe tho
[0:35:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Make Tic-Tac-Toe by adding alcohol to it LUL
[0:35:46] <%GenericSoda> in the case of something like four frames, parryingis a five frame window so its literally unreactable. you would need to predict
[0:35:49] <%krispen_wa> Triple Triad is just REALLY INTENSE tictactoe
[0:35:51] <%DensityD> always bet loyalty, always bet sword
[0:35:57] <MayorRev> tic tac toe is still 1.0
[0:35:59] <+netrac> chess has a stupid amount of valid states
[0:35:59] <Dancenorigins> tic tac toe gun
[0:36:03] <%Karkatstoaster> Dots and boxes also
[0:36:03] <%Exiliator> "The total number of possible chess positions exceeds the best estimate for the number of atoms in the universe." SeemsGood
[0:36:05] <sparkly_yoyo> tic tac toe frame perfect parries
[0:36:09] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Yar harr fiddle dee dee
[0:36:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> This is why Rock Paper Scissors is S-tier
[0:36:11] <dizimous> an exotrac
[0:36:11] <%gatorafan> When's 5D tic tac toe?
[0:36:13] <DianaTheAscian> ive nulled every tick tac toe game ive played for 3 years
[0:36:15] <%chosenjuan42> in tic tac toe player 2 just decided if they want to lose or tie
[0:36:17] <+joker626> so cyberpunk 2077 chess ?
[0:36:19] <%TheLemuroid> They should add powerups
[0:36:20] <%Theycallmenerf> Is there a game where Parrying causes damage but actual punch or kick inputs don’t cause damage?
[0:36:21] <%SirGO0SE> and then that person loses in 4 turns to MoistCritikal
[0:36:22] <+thunka10> you say that, but people still play Connect 4, another solved game
[0:36:22] <andrex2311> so... no fun allowed
[0:36:22] <CrematedCube> I think the term is a "perfect information game", something that has no luck involved whatsoever
[0:36:29] <%GenericSoda> @th3smartalec nah rock paper scissors is reactable
[0:36:31] <Drusain> rps is solvable, rock always wins
[0:36:38] <thekrawler> go is goat
[0:36:39] <RichochetForce> 5D Go
[0:36:40] <+Rusty_beartrap> Become as Gods
[0:36:40] <Supabait> Go needs a neural net
[0:36:43] <%krispen_wa> Pokemon GO?
[0:36:44] <derap41> One word Quanturcomputers
[0:36:45] <%DensityD> hikaru no go
[0:36:45] <%feign___> tic tac toe two
[0:36:53] <%Asuterisuku> Go is eternal.
[0:36:53] <%Exiliator> Its theoretically solved as well
[0:36:55] <time_axis> shogi probably has too many possibilities too
[0:37:00] <%krispen_wa> F/GO?
[0:37:01] <SomersaultJustice> Do not pass Go
[0:37:02] <%Karkatstoaster> Wasn’t Bobby Fischer a neoNazi for like 80% of his life
[0:37:02] <%ozzrabbit> Didn’t they use Tick-Tack-Toe to save the world in War Games?
[0:37:04] <%gatorafan> Go 1
[0:37:06] <%Theycallmenerf> Toho tic tac toe
[0:37:06] <+netrac> Just use backtracking!
[0:37:06] <Supabait> Most go AIs are neural nets based on human games i would assume
[0:37:06] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan I haven't played chess in several years, tried to be part of a club in school and in a small competition dude said "Nice going idiot" and check mated me in few turns and people laughed. NotLikeThis
[0:37:08] <%andrex2311> HOW ABOUT TIC TAC TWO?!
[0:37:09] <CastellanVon> GO1
[0:37:10] <@Menitta> Mahjong will never be solved
[0:37:15] <+ividboy> technically it's solvable
[0:37:17] <%Exiliator> since there are finite number of positions
[0:37:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> AlphaGo and AlphaZero stomped the world champs
[0:37:19] <+linSP> solve this
[0:37:20] <OldOnyx> wasn't Go solved like last year?
[0:37:22] <pixel_river> i tried understanding shogi in yakuza but gave up
[0:37:23] <%DensityD> all I want to do, is see you turn into, a giant woman
[0:37:27] <%krispen_wa> Go Fish?
[0:37:29] <+netrac> Because nobody knows how to play Mahjong
[0:37:29] <axelkaspar> WEEABOO
[0:37:30] <+ividboy> since it's perfect info and no random factor

[0:37:35] <pixel_river> no mahjong i mean
[0:37:36] <%TheLemuroid> New Boy!
[0:37:38] <%GenericSoda> mahjong is too random, but yoy xan keep track of tiles used to a degree
[0:37:42] <%DensityD> DRUNK TOO MUCH CHUCKOLA COLA
[0:37:42] <+SuperUnhappyman> mahjong can't be solved because everyone skips it in yakuza

[1:08:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:08:34] <%DensityD> WHY DIDN'T zap tap trigger?
[1:08:36] <%Karkatstoaster> All these Joe variants are like dios kids in part six. They make the original Spiky Giorno less special
[1:08:37] <%DensityD> 1 defense?
[1:08:38] <MyNameIsRasus> @ozmon the ghost of Joe's Past, Present and Future
[1:08:38] <nicversus> Imagine if the game gave you a crowd of white magikoopas, just a sea of white hoods from the back
[1:08:39] <%Papa_Bearman> Their defense is 0 on their backs; Bobbery just doesn't hit that hard yet.
[1:08:40] <+ividboy> explosions do more damage to fire enemies
[1:08:42] <sparkly_yoyo> is it me or the zap tap's not doing shit?
[1:08:50] <%andrex2311> @GeneralSCPatton and no spike
[1:08:51] <%Papa_Bearman> Earth Tremor.
[1:08:55] <SethKyu> zap doesn't work against shells?
[1:08:56] <roguemephilesclone> No, Bobbery just deals4.
[1:08:58] <+Hawk_Rush> @sparkly_yoyo it works on certain enemies
[1:09:04] <%chosenjuan42> they are armored
[1:09:04] <thekrawler> zap tap doesnt work with shell tosses
[1:09:07] <%JeoDood> shell = hammer
[1:09:07] <+Prof_Everything> I Am the Spike of my Shell
[1:09:08] <%ozmon> They don't contact you directly they're shelled
[1:09:08] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> shells dont get zaped like koops
[1:09:08] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> The shells protect
[1:09:09] <%Toynota10> cuz of those shells
[1:09:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Armor probably? I 'unno
[1:09:15] <grimshuck> @densityd shell attack protect from contact damage
[1:09:15] <%ozmon> They have Koops/Hammer rule
[1:09:17] <nxflre> shell insulates lol
[1:09:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Does Zap only do one damage? So it got negated by defense?
[1:09:22] <%LoVezineTheAir> Bobbery deals 5 to fFire Bubbles because explosion > fire
[1:09:23] <%Karkatstoaster> Are the shells made of rubber????
[1:09:24] <%jepupu> Ohh, gotta turn around before damaging
[1:09:25] <%chosenjuan42> earth tremor?
[1:09:28] <%NottaAlotta> aren't buzzy beetles immune to elemental attacks?
[1:09:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Mario into Vivian super should work
[1:09:40] <nxflre> yee
[1:09:43] <nxflre> they immune
[1:09:43] <Nyerp> shell toss
[1:09:47] <pookam> you got plenty of star power

[1:10:39] <nicversus> Fieri Jinx, guy Fieri shows up and takes your foes to flavortown
[1:10:40] <%Jakeofalco> big nose
[1:10:41] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> She got that shape tho
[1:10:41] <+gollion> man enemies that force you to use AOEs kinda suck
[1:10:44] <sparkly_yoyo> that hat's pretty cool
[1:10:45] <time_axis> probably has eyes under the hair
[1:10:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie calm down
[1:10:47] <%bbblaketwitching> So Woolie decided against Jumpman huh?
[1:10:48] <pookam> i used to think her blush was her eye

[1:11:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> TUMMY??? MY MAN KKona
[1:11:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie, the tummy made it weird
[1:11:05] <Nyerp> flurrie worthless
[1:11:07] <+Hawk_Rush> @gollion it's not that bad, because if you just use earth tremor, you get star power back after like, 2 turns
[1:11:08] <+clapbeat> reggie thats a weird ass thing to say
[1:11:09] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:11:09] <+Sliverits> I have just learned that that is blush, not an eye
[1:11:10] <+Snipershot489> Reggie loves the tummy
[1:11:11] <%Karkatstoaster> Tummy is good don’t judge a man for liking tummy
[1:11:11] <%Jakeofalco> @linSP for real

[1:11:43] <%ozmon> Veil rules are: If Mario has acted before, he will lose his turn after
[1:11:43] <%sexdrugsvideogames> i need to read the wiki

[1:11:51] <+Euphbugg> still gonna get hit
[1:11:54] <%chosenjuan42> @gollion he is labbing
[1:11:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> When they were playing UNIST he wanted Wagner to step on him
[1:12:00] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[1:12:01] <+Hawk_Rush> gotta read what veil does
[1:12:06] <Nyerp> veil uses 2 turns
[1:12:10] <%bbblaketwitching> they know when to swing
[1:12:10] <%geosspone> you lose the turn when you come out of veil unless Vivian is first
[1:12:14] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @FuqBoiSlim hahahahahahaha
[1:12:17] <%chosenjuan42> tremors!
[1:12:22] <%andrex2311> ded
[1:12:23] <penitentpentwitch> Armor bypassed
[1:12:26] <MyNameIsRasus> If Mario acts first, Veil costs 2 turns
[1:12:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> THUNDER GOD MARIO
[1:12:33] <%LoVezineTheAir> veil skips a turn
[1:12:33] <%Karkatstoaster> Wait Golion is in the chat. Holy shit dude I love ur work, what’s it like being made out of 5 lion robots?
[1:12:34] <+linSP> veil is good for missing a hyper move and taking a normal one
[1:12:38] <%DensityD> vivian first for veil, or nothing
[1:12:40] <%kelvinxj> Zues!!
[1:12:42] <%TheLemuroid> Could use some Sweet Treat
[1:12:43] <sparkly_yoyo> this guy's fucked
[1:12:48] <MyNameIsRasus> At least according to woolieONEGUY
[1:12:53] <%JeoDood> veil needs to be first
[1:13:08] <+ividboy> it used to be better when it was outta sight
[1:13:08] <%geosspone> spin jump would have killed there
[1:13:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Apparently if you do Veil FIRST you won't lose your turn next round
[1:13:11] <Smoogers> sweet treat for them heals?
[1:13:15] <%ozmon> Although I think you could use Outta Sight in the spot dodge way in the first game
[1:13:20] <+gollion> used to be much better in the 80s kark
[1:13:31] <sparkly_yoyo> no
[1:13:36] <%krispen_wa> BRUDDA

[1:13:59] <%chosenjuan42> SHINE GET
[1:14:00] <shiny_prinny> those paper waves
[1:14:05] <%ozmon> Yup, If Mario doesn't act before Veil, he can act after. If Mario acts before Veil, he can't act after
[1:14:08] <undercoverbarber> Wakka bump + Strange leaf was OP in the first game
[1:14:13] <%bbblaketwitching> I see we're on the way to the best one
[1:14:15] <Smoogers> can mode < vivian hugs

[2:11:22] <%marshalmorphino2> Worth it
[2:11:23] <%DensityD> the only reason Cortez was so defensive is because he thought it was Wario
[2:11:26] <ascruxl> Good call
[2:11:27] <%GenericSoda> @scorpionoutcast didnt he?
[2:11:27] <daimon_shaw> Flavio: My work here is done.

[3:37:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bobberty about to be infused with the essence of Oppenheimer.
[3:37:02] <SixthSun2> 30 HP, he's a tank @WoolieVersus
[3:37:02] <%Karkatstoaster> ROYAL GUARD
[3:37:04] <shiny_prinny> sounds like bobbery's Zap Tap
[3:37:05] <+Thunderhog> You can try to put him in front but that's about it
[3:37:05] <%bbblaketwitching> I'm pretty sure thats bad
[3:37:09] <Louie_Salmon> Well they usually go for the front, not always
[3:37:14] <+thunka10> Stall tank
[3:37:14] <+agumon9000> Do the hooktail thing ASAP btw
[3:37:17] <noe_juan_kanobe> Royal Revenge?
[3:37:18] <+CptBritches> That's if you know a big attack is coming I guess
[3:37:18] <Bootkiller6> Yeah he's a healthy old man
[3:37:19] <%Papa_Bearman> I hate counterstance. It's so lucky.
[3:37:20] <%ozmon> And then it needs to be a melee attack too
[3:37:21] <Taarin> He's a physical wall
[3:37:22] <%falyden> this is why Vivian 100%
[3:37:23] <+Juriasu> some enemies can only attack they party member in front
[3:37:24] <differential617> WAIT! go get his quest item first!
[3:37:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> that's fair
[3:37:31] <+Metrick_92> Bomb is stronger. that's what matters
[3:37:37] <milhousego> Bobber is a straight tank!
[3:37:38] <+Zeromaru2> 30 HP plus 1 more attcak
[3:37:41] <twieetcha> Not not all attacks I think
[3:37:42] <%geosspone> Bomb damage go up tho
[3:37:43] <%Papa_Bearman> It would only be worth it if enemies were forced to hit him.
[3:37:45] <%marshalmorphino2> Bomb is strong
[3:37:45] <roguemephilesclone> Hooktail's last secret is a better reward than this, trust me.
[3:37:48] <+agumon9000> Viel is still stronger though in the end
[3:37:50] <%Cynical_Canadian> The main gain is the 30 HP
[3:37:50] <%chosenjuan42> To Hooktail castle
[3:37:50] <Syrushmx> Side quest board first, and then castle
[3:37:52] <+Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus It returns exactly half the damage he takes
[3:37:52] <+Hawk_Rush> just gotta try it
[3:37:53] <+CptBritches> You have to do the lab tim
[3:37:56] <MagiKestral> bombs strong and removes fog
[3:37:56] <%JeoDood> Bobbery is kinda low tier
[3:38:03] <Bootkiller6> Zap Tap is pretty solid
[3:38:11] <%Karkatstoaster> I need to take a shower and get dressed (it’s 2 pm and I’m still in my pajamas) but I don’t want to miss any of the good good goofs on stream... the dilemma of modern man
[3:38:11] <noe_juan_kanobe> Super Appeal?
[3:38:17] <daimon_shaw> Bobbery is much worse than the Bomb partner in 64, honestly.
[3:38:19] <%ozmon> Zap Tap's kinda better than Hold Fast lol, it's on all the time
[3:38:20] <daimon_shaw> Bobette.
[3:38:26] <+regis_j_rock> Zap Tap is amazing against Fuzzies, but otherwise just kinda alright
[3:38:27] <PoisonousCatnip> zap tap prevents fuzzys from attacking you

[3:43:42] <%marshalmorphino2> But what if after that boss is a BIGGER BOSS?
[3:43:43] <pookam> bosses almost always have a heal block and save point before them
[3:43:44] <shiny_prinny> people are traumatized from the old school rpg days
[3:43:44] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> griff may have more storys
[3:43:44] <Dossy5> has woolie checked out the back of the trouble centre?
[3:43:47] <%JeoDood> then you hate color splash
[3:43:49] <%Exiliator> Then.. there is no difference because you wont use em against the boss anyway Kappa
[3:43:54] <%ozmon> Grifty lurkin
[3:43:55] <%sexdrugsvideogames> bro, its a game for kids... how hard can it be?

[3:44:28] <+Grayhammatter> here we go
[3:44:29] <%Karkatstoaster> Sticker Star is the worst because EVERYTHING is a consumable, including key items, and if you use something at the wrong time you need to grind money and backtrack to a special shop to rebuy those key items
[3:44:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp

[3:46:05] <+regis_j_rock> Food for thought: why Charge P when you can just increase Base Attack?
[3:46:07] <RichochetForce> "I identify as a Jumpman!"

[4:02:41] <%Karkatstoaster> I’m legitimately confused as to why mods deleted that. If any of them want to whisper a precise explanation I’d appreciate. Was it just the caps lock?
[4:02:42] <JetpackMcQuack> He doesn't know what day it is
[4:02:43] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> He's just an advisor
[4:02:44] <Indigo_Automaton> He is
[4:02:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> He's a recurring Mario character

[4:03:46] <%chosenjuan42> Toadsworth is basically Jafar and peach is the sultan

[4:07:58] <Rain_Mage> One of the ingredients was Ruin Powder
[4:08:00] <%Cynical_Canadian> It makes you a flaccid pancake

[4:08:24] <MovieHipster> Someone uploaded the entire guidebook PDF on e-hentai yesterday its really cool, not suggesting you use it just nice documentation
[4:08:25] <%Karkatstoaster> @woolieversus outside of battle = no effect in DEF
[4:08:30] <CrematedCube> Yeah, follow the guides
[4:08:31] <%TheLemuroid> Finishing the recipe book was the final thing when I did 100% runs back in the day
[4:08:33] <TrapperCap> jelly ultra is ridiculously expensive
[4:08:35] <%chosenjuan42> mushroom and syrup is safe combo
[4:08:43] <TrapperCap> it’s a good healing item but it’s not worth it
[4:08:45] <%DensityD> suffer for content

[4:08:54] <%RadicalWeegee> Hoooktaaail plz <3
[4:09:00] <%BestTeaMaker> what about luigi
[4:09:02] <penitentpentwitch> Best would be a heal/buff or heal/damage enemy.

[4:09:23] <sparkly_yoyo> I thought you came to see the don
[4:09:24] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> you have to go the castle to use the sprites
[4:09:26] <sparkly_yoyo> haha
[4:09:27] <Bootkiller6> don't cook a whacka bump, you only get 8 of those in the game and you can make the same item with different ingredients
[4:09:28] <MovieHipster> Coconut + Fire Flower was a 7 dmg bomb item iirc
[4:09:28] <+cdrom321> @trappercap If you already have them, it's still bezt to cook them together.

[4:09:44] <+Ether101_Prime> Does this still have the quick explosion by hitting the button twice like in the first game?
[4:09:44] <%chosenjuan42> dont cook super SHROOM alone. add syrup

[4:33:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Classic Bard move
[4:33:37] <Bootkiller6> Heck, there are LVL1 mario runs where they put all points into BP and just don't equip any more than 3BP worth of badges
[4:33:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[4:33:40] <CalderGaming> true for many californians
[4:33:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie gets it
[4:33:43] <%Doplghost> California sounds like hell
[4:33:44] <RichochetForce> Awful
[4:33:52] <%Irridium> so glad I don't live in California
[4:33:53] <%kinetikpaws> commuting sucks
[4:33:55] <%sexdrugsvideogames> stay home, play games
[4:34:06] <%chosenjuan42> Now with COVID traffic has gone down
[4:34:06] <Taarin> Dad drives 1:30 to work. It's a hellscape
[4:34:09] <+storkeylope> Oh god Florida with broken A/C is hell
[4:34:10] <%Shwepie> No reason to move to California anymore.
[4:34:15] <CalderGaming> I lucked out by having a job that was a 10 minute motorcycle ride from my apartment when I last was in CA
[4:34:20] <thekrawler> california sucks ass
[4:34:27] <qcs_Barker> Reject outside weather, embrace video games
[4:34:30] <%krispen_wa> Bay Area public transportation is pretty good tho
[4:34:45] <%feign___> its not great. if my family wasn't here I'd have moved out of CA a long time ago. still might eventually. the cost of living is ridiculous
[4:34:49] <%Proxzo> I'm in CA. The commute is bad, which is why you live close to work.
[4:34:53] <%chosenjuan42> Traffic in California is why I followed your podcast
[4:34:53] <%DensityD> the struggle
[4:34:55] <%marshalmorphino2> Public transport is murder, especially right now
[4:34:58] <CalderGaming> @krispen_wa it is, but way more people are in SoCal which is carscarscars
[4:35:06] <RichochetForce> Commutes are brutal
[4:35:09] <noe_juan_kanobe> Socal (○.○)/
[4:35:13] <%Papa_Bearman> My commute used to be a 60-minute drive followed by a 15-minute walk EACH WAY. Then I found a house literally a five-minute walk away from work.
[4:35:15] <NotHereToStream> commutes do indeed suck
[4:35:21] <%Proxzo> We have good japanese food here though.
[4:35:28] <%Exiliator> ... isnt that the norm?
[4:35:29] <RichochetForce> I have an 1:30 long commute each way and you basically have no day with that + work
[4:35:31] <%13ry4n93> 13ry4n93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! hey woolie, stopping by again to say that I'm really enjoying your Halo series, I'm rather curious to see what your opinion on ODST is assuming you get around to it.
[4:35:42] <@akuda_bar> i used to read manga on the train. but now i just work from home
[4:35:53] <%feign___> yeah, socal is definitely worse with the exception of the bay area
[4:35:53] <CappuccinoGuil> I wrote whole ass fanfics on the way to college every morning LUL
[4:36:16] <%kinetikpaws> I'm lucky enough to have a 5-minute ride to work still always sleepy because night shift though
[4:36:18] <%Proxzo> I dunno, i guess I like the variety of food you can find in socal, and the large asian community.
[4:36:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[4:36:35] <atomicxdj> woolieYE
[4:36:36] <Visorak6> ODST is my favorite of all the series
[4:36:53] <%krispen_wa> I remember when i lived in so-cal. I was garbage at driving so I could literally get nowhere without like an Uber or a friend driving
[4:37:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I've played all of them except ODST. wWhat makes it so good?
[4:37:13] <%Proxzo> But rent is high in SoCal.
