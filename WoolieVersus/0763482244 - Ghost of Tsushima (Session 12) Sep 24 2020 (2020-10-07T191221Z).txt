[0:02:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I hear that, saw a Char player not too upset
[0:03:02] <+2sappy> Did you see that Kirby Fighters 2 is out woolie?
[0:03:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> As new content is released patches on old content is necessary for balnce
[0:03:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> balance
[0:03:57] <%mikesapartment> just make a Public Test Server for people to mess around in

[0:05:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I mean, imagine the 3 versions of SF3 occurring within the same ecosystem, the problem is, older versions are just not playable anymore

[0:05:35] <+chosenjuan42> When will FIGHT CRAB get on Getting into Fighting Games?
[0:05:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Imagine never being able to play Guilty Gear XX base again, only Accent Core +R
[0:06:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @chosenjuan42 Asking the real questions
[0:07:18] <jorniev> the awnser lies...
[0:07:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Melee
[0:07:29] <jorniev> in the heart of battle
[0:07:41] <GloriousMost> But when the game becomes "Play what is good against this OP character" its less fun.
[0:08:26] <nintega010> @GloriousMost I don't like counter pick meta
[0:09:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @GloriousMost yeah, true, when people only play the match up, but even then, people who just play the match up aren't often good enough that its not an issue in my perspective
[0:09:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> unless people always play the zoner against the grappler
[0:11:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> someone needs to fucking talk to DE about buffs/nerfs
[0:11:35] <MartwyPies> woolie fatty
[0:13:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> gotta love keats
[0:14:19] <%paladinstarbuster> what are they talking about
[0:14:47] <Equirah> you can go back to older versions
[0:14:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1308260203280949248?s=20
[0:14:51] <+thackattack00> that's a pretty good point
[0:14:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @paladinstarbuster patches, nerfs/buffs, changes, brought up by the Granblue update
[0:15:00] <sendart> having to buy a whole new game sucks
[0:15:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Minh Said bring back the Groove system
[0:15:21] <Equirah> patches can be removed
[0:16:01] <OldManDeckardCain> let's give gran midscreen combo for 4k dmg lol
[0:16:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Reggie's main got nerfed, huh?
[0:16:42] <%eanscrale> That game was already like pouring molasses
[0:17:01] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Don't be scared of doing a Yakuza lp. The games are long but you can do most of it offscreen. The main story is of average length. The challenge is finding the side stories everyone wants to see on camera. Judgment or 0 would be good first picks.
[0:17:18] <Equirah> if a character's doing too much it needs to get options removed
[0:18:20] <Equirah> you know what streamers love? games you have to play offscreen as well because they don't have a private life LUL
[0:18:40] <+duskrush> I love how Woolie and V's streams are "Get that vehicle in there"
[0:19:17] <+Mordexai0> So woolie, when is Get Into Fighting Games for Kirby Fighters 2?
[0:20:07] <%Lion_kun> I mean Death Stranding was a joy for streaming.
[0:20:43] <@SoushinSen> @equirah you said patches can be removed. Sure but you can't play online with the older patches anymore.
[0:21:30] <+jiggy_snipe> but you don't have to pop in 50 cents anymore
[0:21:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that's what's kinda good about Strive's team, very engaging about intention, even if they are still kinda cryptic
[0:22:01] <OldManDeckardCain> you can just play offline cpu grans, they act the same as real people somehow LUL
[0:22:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:15] <Equirah> @SoushinSen you can now, not through the game's matchmaking but you can
[0:22:57] <%Exiliator> Id watch Woolie play every single jacuzzi sidequest, they're amazing
[0:23:24] <%paladinstarbuster> THEY DONT
[0:23:30] <%johnny_gogo> ITS NOT BALANCED
[0:23:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> If they had to put out a new game for a patch, they'd probably really test those balance changes
[0:23:36] <+DK_MisterFly> Need S2 Laura S3 2nd V-Trigger Woolie help
[0:23:36] <Equirah> sure, if you remove the content grind from the games that'd work great but they won't cause MTX
[0:23:44] <redrins> everything gets nerfed and buffed all the time in league its nuts
[0:23:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> It wouldn't be so arbitrary
[0:23:48] <stevo_scar> was the box ever opened?

[0:24:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> GROOOOOOOOVES
[0:24:30] <+remdiel> ask Warframe lol
[0:24:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> Grooves should be standard in all fighting games
[0:24:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> version select is a neat idea
[0:24:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 howdy Woolie and the gang. Are you caught up on the new season of The Boys? Shit is getting REAL. Excited to see how the season wraps it all up

[0:27:14] <%Exiliator> hello
[0:27:15] <stevo_scar> @woolieversus what was in the 📦?
[0:27:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I stopped playing Rising Thunder, even before it died because I got too salty from a patch, sucks but people act like that
[0:27:42] <redrins> soriz seems really good now tho

[0:27:58] <Ookamiden02> Zero is great
[0:28:07] <%paladinstarbuster> Hes right V kinda overblew tt
[0:28:19] <%bread_assassin> Woolie could always get a shortlist from Pat for the good Yakuza 0 substories.
[0:28:30] <%Exiliator> ... I still think playing kiwami before 0 is the smarter way to play...
[0:28:45] <%Livelinne> bbunsBoi z
[0:29:06] <%Exiliator> 1 then 0 then 2
[0:29:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:19] <brunoberserk> depends in how you play
[0:29:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Exiliator kinda curious, why so?
[0:29:26] <%Lion_kun> 1 is baaaad for newbies
[0:29:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BREAKING ZA LAAAAAAAAAAAAW

[0:29:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BREAKING ZA WOOOOOOOOOOOORLD
[0:29:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I would not
[0:29:44] <%Exiliator> Its like watching the hobbit before watching lotr
[0:29:45] <CappuccinoGuil> PLEASE, CABARET TIMES
[0:29:48] <%doomerskeletor13> 100% would love to watch that
[0:29:53] <+Mordexai0> @woolieversus will you do a GIFG for Kirby Fighters 2 just to see you go into Kirby lore?
[0:30:05] <Zeif00> Only if there was a lot of off screen prep
[0:30:15] <brunoberserk> good name
[0:30:16] <CappuccinoGuil> It's SO HYPE
[0:30:17] <SilverFaustX> amazon just launched it own game streaming service
[0:30:20] <%doomerskeletor13> I think it would be right up your guys alley
[0:30:43] <%bread_assassin> Unless Woolie does every single substory and and all of the business quests on camera, it would def be shorter than KOTOR 2.
[0:30:46] <CasualAlohaFriday> 144 Fun per Session or why bother
[0:30:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza 0 is packed with a lot of fun, that definitely wouldn’t be a problem
[0:31:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the human eye can only see 30 fun per session
[0:31:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Yakuza 0 would offer some backseating shenanigans, yes
[0:31:19] <Equirah> @doomerskeletor13 be real LUL
[0:31:27] <%afronooch> there are large swaths of Act 2 that wouldn't be fun to watch
[0:31:43] <%Exiliator> Sure, but I still find Woolie's style of cutting up content weird
[0:31:46] <+DK_MisterFly> Persona dagamerKek
[0:31:49] <stevo_scar> 0 or judge eyes?
[0:31:52] <brunoberserk> arkham asylum is always a option ... right ? dnoGEESE
[0:32:14] <%Exiliator> LP poison maybe, but livestreaming gold!
[0:32:16] <redrins> it has great fps
[0:32:28] <CappuccinoGuil> None of the sidequests are UNenjoyable. None
[0:32:36] <%johnny_gogo> its great to see woolie be real
[0:32:41] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s very worth imo. The story is great
[0:32:46] <SilverFaustX> just ask pat about yakuzi
[0:32:48] <%Mr_Strut> Better learn shogi
[0:33:00] <%paladinstarbuster> its realy not that long
[0:33:03] <%Lion_kun> Mahjong for life
[0:33:10] <%afronooch> hope your ready to learn mahjong
[0:33:11] <%doomerskeletor13> I also think the gameplay is right up your alley
[0:33:11] <SilverFaustX> fuck mahjong
[0:33:13] <%Solidnick18> mahjong NotLikeThis
[0:33:16] <%johnny_gogo> Yakuza has a great generic anime plot
[0:33:18] <Naho_Saenoki> And if you like superbosses, doing all substories always unlocks one.
[0:33:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Kiwami takes a dive in quality because it has a mahjong main mission NotLikeThis
[0:33:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 1300
[0:33:30] <%Lion_kun> Mahjong is the best
[0:33:45] <Equirah> hey woolie, play Nioh LUL
[0:33:56] <%Lion_kun> Despair girls
[0:34:04] <CappuccinoGuil> You like Sopranos and Anime. You'll like it
[0:34:05] <%doomerskeletor13> As long as you don’t play a lot of mini games you’ll be fine
[0:34:22] <%Exiliator> People watch streams of streamers grinding for whatever for hours in mmos
[0:34:23] <SilverFaustX> does woolie know a new kirby game came out today?
[0:34:38] <Equirah> will you guys be playing Replicant tho?
[0:34:51] <+remdiel> ok see y'all!

[0:51:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer800 this is just one idiots opinion, but I think a Y0 LP would be on par with Paper Mario. There’s a lot of cool story stuff to react to, and really funny shit in the side stuff. As long as you don’t get lost in the mini games the game would probably be shorter than KOTOR 2. Sorry if you’re sick of hearing about it, I just figured I’d give feedback on what you were discussing. Either way love the content
[0:51:37] <%Mr_Strut> How do they not hear that fucking armor rustling around?

[0:54:07] <%Livelinne> HyperLost
[0:54:13] <%emperordread> when I was in school, every bitch thought they had a quiet voice but would talk so loud anyone could hear them
[0:54:22] <bevyrage> the trope is called a 'stage whisper' and it's from old old theatre back before the renaissance
[0:54:27] <+duskrush> not the thugs, the dudes who got murdered, I think
[0:54:45] <Pappajimbo> the boat?
[0:55:33] <%emperordread> pretty sure it's between masako and the way you came, in the water
[0:55:53] <+xeros720> this is why the Tomb Raider "God VIsion" was made
[0:55:55] <%Exiliator> One of the reason I just remembered why I think zero was better to play after kiwami: because its chock-full of reverse references, like kiryus suit for example
[0:56:25] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:56:32] <%emperordread> called it!
[0:56:35] <+duskrush> lmao

[0:56:51] <CappuccinoGuil> dude's just vibing
[0:56:52] <%Livelinne> F
[0:57:16] <%Lion_kun> 0 adds a lot of depth to Kiwami. Like fleshing out Nishiki, Reina, Shimano and Kazama
[0:58:07] <GlaceonYo> Ghost of Sushi
[0:58:17] <kenny_biff> her mission list is almost up though
[0:58:21] <%Exiliator> But 0, even as a prequel, also builds upon the latter parts
[0:58:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k

[0:58:47] <kenny_biff> every time
[0:58:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @Mr_Strut but consider this: dosho
[0:58:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but revenge tho
[0:58:52] <%afronooch> they could've taken like 3 Masako missions and given them to Yuna
[0:59:00] <%Livelinne> They speaking such Samurai movie language I love it spaceyeenLaugh
[0:59:00] <%koolaid_kevster> kono dio da!!!
[0:59:07] <%johnny_gogo> yeah 5 missions where you help her kill people and the a few dealing with the depression after would be nice
[0:59:20] <%Exiliator> Like its just my imo, but I think its better to see majima in 1 first, then see his story in 0
[0:59:26] <%Lion_kun> Ssshhhhh
[0:59:35] <%Solidnick18> what
[0:59:48] <Halospaz117> Eh, I was fine with it, mostly cuz I spaced it out enough

[1:52:45] <%doomerskeletor13> I think the game has bugged out a bit
[1:52:47] <Halospaz117> That "We did this together" was directed towards Jin's dick, not Norio
[1:52:53] <%Livelinne> CINEMATOGRAPHY
[1:53:00] <%DashXero> Man... Cleaning that up is gonna be a bitch....
[1:53:00] <+MrAtheGreat> @johnny_gogo I honestly don't know what else they could have done, except have the player select their loadout from a pause menu.

[2:00:16] <pjbuster> ^
[2:00:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> and?
[2:00:20] <armchairmaster_> It'd be like spoiling Vader being luke's dad @reverend_roscoe
[2:00:21] <+jiggy_snipe> look man I don't care about MHA but even then
[2:00:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> thats not even close to the same
[2:00:35] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie is playing Halo which is years old and we're being careful not spoil him
[2:00:38] <+MrAtheGreat> Just like that undergrounf oil field
[2:00:39] <+jiggy_snipe> just be considerate
[2:00:43] <Halospaz117> @armchairmaster_ Ah yes, the decades old spoiler is totally comparable to this
[2:00:43] <+MrAtheGreat> yeysy
[2:00:54] <Halospaz117> Like I don't even care too much about MHA but don't be a dick
[2:01:10] <%Reverend_Roscoe> vader being Luke's dad is part of the cultural zeitgeist at this point, MHA is way more niche than that

[2:09:59] <armchairmaster_> "It's a heavy responsibility." Says the man that poisoned an entire camp, cut off a boss's head and threw it at his underlings.

[2:13:50] <Halospaz117> "What's out there, and also everywhere else"
[2:13:51] <+duskrush> Jin wears that blindfold to hold back the Darkness in his heart
[2:13:55] <+duskrush> just like Riku

[2:18:39] <Halospaz117> Yuna's kinda a waifu
[2:18:40] <armchairmaster_> Tomoe got the Cute-Jutsu, so morally-grey
[2:18:41] <%Mr_Strut> Hair not short enough
[2:18:43] <%Exiliator> I would have loved it if Jin has he tries to leave like a badass just accidentally walks into a wall
[2:18:49] <%paladinstarbuster> yunas a waifu
[2:18:53] <misterurbanthelegend> She thiccest in da game tho.
[2:18:54] <%ChoculaUltra> Tomoe has shown waifu qualities tho idc. I'm simping.
[2:19:04] <%emperordread> Banish the fog to the land of Wind and Ghosts
[2:19:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ChoculaUltra my man
[2:19:08] <armchairmaster_> @misterurbanthelegend nah bro, that honor goes to Norio
[2:19:11] <yusefHD> LUL LUL LUL
[2:19:14] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:19:15] <%doomerskeletor13> The fog is activating goblins
[2:19:42] <Nobuwaroo> I had a standoff where the cam was inside a hut. couldnt see shit
[2:19:52] <%ChoculaUltra> the wall splat damage
[2:19:58] <Frostofthecwsw> @nobuwaroo you poor thing
[2:20:01] <%RyTYoung> Uwaaaaaaaaaaauaaaaa
[2:20:13] <+duskrush> I wish you could activate ghost stance during a standoff and fake the enemy out
[2:20:48] <armchairmaster_> Every time Jin activates Ghost mode, Masako wonders why the world suddenly got less red.
[2:20:49] <%Exiliator> Movies can totally do that
[2:20:53] <misterurbanthelegend> HeHe, was thinkin of that joke just now.
[2:21:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> why is your hair blue gameattackSuspicious
[2:21:04] <%Mr_Strut> The fire emblem effect
[2:21:06] <%Livelinne> MEAT
[2:21:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> RPG have a huge problem with this
[2:21:36] <T_Sasquatch> Or anime where the main characters are not wearing their school uniforms correctly
[2:21:37] <+jiggy_snipe> RPGs, why do you have a portrait?
[2:21:42] <armchairmaster_> The Fallout issue, aka (YO YOUR CLOTHES look way more dope)
[2:21:42] <Halospaz117> Masako when Jin goes Ghost mode "You see it too? For me it's always like this"
[2:21:44] <+jiggy_snipe> must be playable
[2:21:45] <+duskrush> Or Resident Evil with items vs the prerendered backgrounds
[2:21:49] <%ChoculaUltra> its super bad in FFXIV imo, literally every npc that's not important just screams fodder
[2:21:58] <%Prevot> when someone makes an anime and doesn't put enough thought into the random background students, so only the 4 main chars have colorful hair
[2:22:02] <Pappajimbo> not npc model #12
[2:22:06] <%ChoculaUltra> then you see a main character for 3 patches that hasn't gotten a name yet and you know that fucker is important LUL
[2:22:06] <%Exiliator> Here's a bunch of random dudes, but wait isnt that one guy robertdowniejrtomcruisetomhanks?
[2:22:15] <%SleepyDavid> every npc looks the same, expect that one i wounder why
[2:22:25] <+duskrush> What tipped me off was when she asks you about murder and expected you to say "murder is GREAT!"
[2:22:30] <T_Sasquatch> @choculaultra as good as the game is, its filled with utterly useless dialogue
[2:22:47] <armchairmaster_> @t_sasquatch what, the dialogues good tho
[2:22:54] <%afronooch> but i can fix her tho
[2:22:58] <misterurbanthelegend> She too hot to not have a catch!
[2:23:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT DID I MISS THE TOMOE REVEA?
[2:23:04] <Pappajimbo> buckler
[2:23:04] <%Exiliator> buckler
[2:23:06] <Halospaz117> ya
[2:23:10] <armchairmaster_> Common woolie, Tomoe's hot, that makes her morally grey
[2:23:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> FSS
[2:23:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> FFS

[2:23:48] <T_Sasquatch> @armchairmaster_ ffxiv quest : talk to 3 rando npcs for more info , single sentence of nothing
[2:23:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:24:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Jin and that archer aiming on each other was unusually tense.
[2:24:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> if you had to pick
[2:24:11] <armchairmaster_> @t_sasquatch oh, i thought you mean Ghost of Tsushima
[2:24:20] <T_Sasquatch> Oh LUL
[2:24:26] <%Exiliator> firefox > chrome
[2:24:35] <%Mr_Strut> Because he believes it!
[2:24:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> orange juspsuits can be stealthy
[2:24:41] <Pappajimbo> he loves the narato
[2:24:44] <armchairmaster_> But Ghost costumes tho
[2:24:45] <%ChoculaUltra> nah yeah, 14's quest dialogue outside of cutscenes and shit is real hit or miss.
[2:24:45] <+DukeBlack_> brave>>>>everything else
[2:24:49] <%Solidnick18> i like the ghost armor more
[2:24:58] <%SleepyDavid> secret naruto cosplay

[2:25:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HOW
[2:25:04] <T_Sasquatch> Chrome takes too much damn memory. Had to uninstall it
[2:25:14] <%Mr_Strut> Is this secretly a boruto game?

[2:25:37] <%Mr_Strut> What to use instead of chrome?
[2:25:40] <%ChoculaUltra> sorry, I mean wild boars monkaS
[2:26:05] <T_Sasquatch> Opera is pretty solid and you can use firefox and chrome extensions
[2:26:10] <+DukeBlack_> brave broswer is nice
[2:26:14] <%ChoculaUltra> I heard opera gx is p dope if you're leaning into more functionality with less weight
[2:26:16] <+Estuko> I use Brave

[2:37:45] <%ChoculaUltra> holy shit thats awesome
[2:38:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ChoculaUltra Me n da bois gonna play for the first time in ages. FeelsGoodMan
[2:38:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:38:02] <armchairmaster_> Like, at least wear some gloves and heavier boots
[2:38:05] <%emperordread> updated how?
[2:38:44] <armchairmaster_> Woolie confirmed not to like the feeling of Fur, destroying the dreams of all furries in chat
[2:38:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Look it up om STeam its a massive DLC size update made by the community and endoresed by Steam
[2:38:47] <%Mr_Strut> Aren't you supposed to wear the fuzzy side on the inside?
[2:39:41] <T_Sasquatch> I've seen those lfd2 models in way too many things
[2:39:43] <armchairmaster_> "A true warrior doesn't rely on his eyes to fight" (proceeds to miss every arrow shot)
[2:39:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> The update adds tons of new content to the game: new weapons, new maps, new enemy types, unused dialogue, and even a new campaign.
[2:40:00] <%ChoculaUltra> thats crazy, props to Valve for letting the fans do something cool for the game/community
[2:40:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ChoculaUltra Unlike some companies
[2:40:14] <%ChoculaUltra> ...now they should let the Black Mesa dudes make HL3. JUST SAYIN'
[2:40:32] <armchairmaster_> @choculaultra i mean, at least we know it would COME OUT
[2:40:37] <%Solidnick18> valve is pretty cool

[2:41:16] <T_Sasquatch> Didn't valve endorse fucking hunt down the Freeman LUL
[2:41:24] <%ChoculaUltra> yes!
[2:41:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Valve is cool with everything, seemingly.
[2:41:41] <%ChoculaUltra> (except sequels beyond the number 2, obviously)
[2:41:49] <armchairmaster_> Yo Ishikawa I just blew up this bear on the way here, it was super honorable.
[2:42:05] <+jiggy_snipe> it's cause they don't intend to do it themselves so might as well let the fans have fun
[2:42:05] <T_Sasquatch> When they make so much money just being a marketplace , why bother with game dev
[2:42:24] <armchairmaster_> @t_sasquatch because new game = more money for longer
[2:42:47] <%RyTYoung> huh
[2:43:05] <%RyTYoung> its a tough question
[2:43:11] <T_Sasquatch> Ahh telltale
[2:43:25] <armchairmaster_> You gotta pick a side Jin, no time for neturality with the Mongols
[2:43:29] <%ChoculaUltra> p sure Valve still makes wild amounts of money from just TF2 hats/keys. Same with CSGO.
[2:43:30] <T_Sasquatch> That was an era
[2:44:30] <armchairmaster_> @choculaultra eh, the TF2 burnout has been real for some time now. All they need to do is make Team Fortress 3 exactly like TF2, except on Source 2, WITHOUT the spaghetti code.
[2:44:46] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo that would be incredible
