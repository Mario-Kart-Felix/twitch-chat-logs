[0:06:14] <falyden> Wakka!!
[0:06:16] <ken_kuma> 10 is certainly something
[0:06:16] <%JoshManVGH> You reached credits, it was fine

[0:06:29] <+sherndon226> good afternoon @WoolieVersus
[0:06:30] <%KingOfCinders> Been following your shenanigans for a long time Woolie, and it's been really good to see you come into your own over the years, really impressed with the amount and quality of content you've been putting out. Keep it up, guys.
[0:06:31] <+DarkNerdShawny> wait Reggie played FF6 before?
[0:06:32] <shiny_prinny> 10 is probably one of the harder ff games
[0:06:33] <+EdgySalad> Brudda
[0:06:36] <downmagic> ff6 is a classic
[0:06:37] <+SolGainer> FF6 is much simpler and certain party members become totally broken by the end
[0:06:41] <%ChillaxingJay> wooliePOYO
[0:06:42] <%andre11dr> Trick question : Is 10 good?
[0:06:48] <RoboticRexkek> wooliePOYO
[0:06:48] <otakon17> 10 is great
[0:06:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @DarkNerdShawny He's mentioned it a couple times
[0:06:50] <+Laycas49> @andre11dr yes
[0:06:50] <Teradyne87> iPad? I'm rocking my old Brady Games guide for Final Fantasy Anthology
[0:06:52] <iacus_> There are a lot of missable story cutscenes in FF6 so, be on the look out
[0:06:52] <%agoaj> Will I be lost/spoiled if I haven't played Final Fantasy 1 through 5? </s>
[0:06:53] <+sherndon226> I remember when FF6 was FF3
[0:06:56] <BoneofMalkav> I'll just say it right now, Kefka's a somewhat better written villein then Sephrioth.

[0:07:13] <atomicxdj> PogChamp
[0:07:16] <%DreyfussFrost> Since Reggie has played, can he just be the filter for tips and such?
[0:07:18] <+pectusumbra> @BoneofMalkav FFVI is arguably better written than VII in general
[0:07:25] <sullivansbizarreadventure> @andre11dr The answer is: HAHAHAHAHAHA
[0:07:25] <iacus_> no doubt
[0:07:30] <+DarkNerdShawny> @damashi_the_kaotic nice! I know he doesn't play much games so it's cool to see him be the warm one here
[0:07:33] <downmagic> strike while the iron is hot
[0:07:33] <otakon17> I'd say the translation for VI is better
[0:07:41] <+MayLeFay> are they doing coop?

[0:07:42] <Hellvis92> 6 is the best written one according to most of the fanbase
[0:07:42] <insertedgynamehere___> Hello there beeewiWave
[0:07:42] <+RushUnplugged> you can also like a game without shitting on others guys
[0:07:44] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus do you have the font mod?
[0:07:46] <+healnavi> it replays that after you hit new game
[0:07:49] <%gan_n_dorf> @otakon17 this guy are sick
[0:07:50] <+SolGainer> You can skip the first intro btw
[0:07:51] <alrobot2014> you can skip the logo part because it replays when you hit new game
[0:07:52] <otakon17> also I hope Woolie set this up beforehand because the game has a stupid habit of going windowed first and misaligned
[0:07:58] <%townzzzzz> most of all enjoy the tunes that play
[0:08:01] <+EdgySalad> Reggie has played this already?
[0:08:04] <%andre11dr> 10 is so wierd, i simultaneously love it and hate it ,just like Titus
[0:08:04] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Only recommendation would be to install the font mod, yeah.
[0:08:07] <otakon17> the tunes are great

[0:12:59] <+condemned_15> This used to be the opening credits
[0:12:59] <%CoolGuyMcHotPants_> CoolGuyMcHotPants_ subscribed with Prime. 
[0:13:00] <alrobot2014> @DreyfussFrost they took those out in this version for some reason
[0:13:01] <BoneofMalkav> "Brudda! We gotta get these Espers away from our children."
[0:13:01] <%DreyfussFrost> There were
[0:13:02] <+Akizea> theres supposed to be credits here
[0:13:03] <+pectusumbra> Yeah there's supposed to be credits here
[0:13:03] <Vashido22> there were
[0:13:05] <GeoGio3> there were
[0:13:05] <iacus_> There are supposed to be credits
[0:13:05] <otakon17> the original had the credits scroll here
[0:13:06] <+DarkNerdShawny> race wars pt 2
[0:13:07] <%xjn_> yeah there should be
[0:13:07] <ken_kuma> There were
[0:13:07] <badugidugi> there were
[0:13:07] <%ChillaxingJay> yeah there was
[0:13:08] <Garnetguy98> Huh no credits
[0:13:08] <OblivionSword1> text mod forgot the credits ?
[0:13:08] <otakon17> of the original team
[0:13:08] <downmagic> there were
[0:13:10] <%X2Eliah> Ok so the text mode messed it up
[0:13:11] <otakon17> they took it out sadly
[0:13:12] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! War of the Magi let‚Äôs gooooooooooooooo
[0:13:15] <Seyf1ed> yes there were credits
[0:13:15] <marvel877> There used to be credits here, yeah.
[0:13:15] <%oneimportantthing> There used to be credits here. They're gone now
[0:13:16] <toulon_somberjade> Whoa they made new sprites for this scene
[0:13:16] <%andre11dr> No credits for some reason
[0:13:17] <Sunriser41> best single player ff right there
[0:13:18] <iacus_> maybe the mod glitched them, or is something from the remake
[0:13:18] <otakon17> which is KIND of an insult
[0:13:19] <linSP> There were credits
[0:13:21] <+sherndon226> text mod might have taken them out
[0:13:21] <alrobot2014> its not the text mod
[0:13:22] <%DreyfussFrost> @OblivionSword1 Text mod only changes the fonts, not content.
[0:13:23] <otakon17> the mod didn't glitch it
[0:13:24] <RyuuAoi> This sounds like "Mexican Heaven" by SPM
[0:13:26] <nakunattakage> the lights on the horizon majinoRespect
[0:13:27] <otakon17> I played it vanilla
[0:13:27] <nyacoo> Kinda ruins the cinematic opening
[0:13:28] <+healnavi> remaster removed them
[0:13:28] <%xjn_> it kind of robs the scene of some gravitas doesnt it
[0:13:30] <+SolGainer> Mod didn't gltich it
[0:13:30] <crocodile_t34rz> There was a credit here. it's gone now.
[0:13:30] <alrobot2014> i checked with normal text earlier and its still gone
[0:13:31] <%ekodrop> i got to this part. it took too long and i stopped playing
[0:13:32] <Momofukku> YO NO WAY FF6 LEEETS GOOOOOO
[0:13:32] <otakon17> they removed the credits
[0:13:33] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Porpkek fuck em creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu
[0:13:33] <kulmoth> its just like that
[0:13:34] <%Juriasu> yeah
[0:13:35] <%DreyfussFrost> The mod wouldn't have affected credits
[0:13:37] <BlackermanZX> wow
[0:13:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's cool
[0:13:40] <%TreeLeafBoi> Skip
[0:13:41] <Teradyne87> Can confirm the text mod did not take away the credits. They were removed for this release
[0:13:42] <+crybirb> One of the STRONGEST openings in a game till this day
[0:13:43] <%agoaj> This is going to be so hype the second time.

[0:14:27] <%DreyfussFrost> FYI for the newbies, that is NOT the Final Fantasy theme. That's the Prelude, which *also* appears in most games. The theme usually appears in the credits.

[0:15:06] <Vashido22> man
[0:15:06] <%MayLeFay> the prelude that appears in every game isn't the theme?
[0:15:09] <$MonsterEnvy> @DovaDude29 it's off already
[0:15:09] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> bro I'm gonna fucking CRY
[0:15:11] <Teradyne87> Theme of JO Crystal
[0:15:11] <SinnerEbru> yo chat which is better, ff6 or chrono trigger
[0:15:12] <otakon17> @DovaDude29 it only autoscrolls at certain points, otherwise it's button presses
[0:15:12] <Vashido22> I NEED to hear the whole new soundtrac
[0:15:12] <Treasure_Vault> Laura Palmer?
[0:15:16] <%andre11dr> I think it's made with the same graphics as CT
[0:15:18] <otakon17> @Vashido22 it's great
[0:15:18] <+SolGainer> @SinnerEbru unfair comparison
[0:15:19] <Vashido22> @SinnerEbru FF6
[0:15:20] <+SamSoulesque> OH FUCK ITS OUT!?
[0:15:21] <%boletoh> Male sure to turn on subtitles  woolieMIRIN
[0:15:21] <+EdgySalad> this game is makin' me cryyy
[0:15:23] <+Mkingston> DS
[0:15:25] <Vashido22> But its unfair
[0:15:25] <+Mkingston> PC
[0:15:26] <%ChillaxingJay> @Treasure_Vault ikr LUL
[0:15:27] <%BestTeaMaker> @SinnerEbru don't start
[0:15:28] <%DreyfussFrost> You want the GOOD script? Not on DS.
[0:15:28] <Garnetguy98> You‚Äôre gonna be saying the musics pretty a lot
[0:15:29] <Vashido22> chrono trigger is also godlike
[0:15:30] <leith_aziz> I've never seen Chrono Trigger of FF6, so neither
[0:15:30] <marvel877> I enjoyed it for the first time last year. If I had a better computer (or if they'd put it on the Switch), I'd play this version too.
[0:15:33] <iacus_> There is no Definitive version sadly, they each has its pros and cons
[0:15:36] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk
[0:15:36] <jkfd> man the music what
[0:15:36] <+pectusumbra> @SinnerEbru Yeah, not really the same even if they both are JRPGS
[0:15:40] <%ChillaxingJay> AngelThump
[0:15:46] <iacus_> but doesnt seem this Pixel Remaster is a bad way to start
[0:15:47] <downmagic> 1994
[0:15:51] <downmagic> man
[0:15:51] <ErikFeral> the music is gonna flex the whole game
[0:15:52] <%DreyfussFrost> Sucks when the originals are still the definitive and they're not made available. (FF5, 6, CT)
[0:15:53] <GeoGio3> 27
[0:15:53] <%Juriasu> pixel remasters are way more faithful than say the gba verisions in my opinion but even the pixel remasters aren't exactly like the originals
[0:15:53] <InXplotch> is this the default text or modded?
[0:15:54] <@Solidus_113> 20 years ago was FF10
[0:15:56] <Vashido22> Both ff6 and chrono trigger as godlike, just personally FF6 hits me more
[0:15:59] <MurseJOCO> Glad they use this tune for the login too for FFXIV Online BibleThump
[0:15:59] <%Xelhesia> FF6 for me. CT is god tier too tho
[0:16:00] <Parapattern> Nearly 30
[0:16:05] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> I was too young and poor to play this videogame at the time.
[0:16:05] <cheapdoc> Before many people in this chat were even born
[0:16:05] <alrobot2014> this game is 28 years old
[0:16:08] <+healnavi> SNES FF6's mechanics are broken AS FUCK.
[0:16:08] <+RigmaroleHM> Loading times just mean more time to shitpost on twitter
[0:16:10] <+HereComestheChief> God, I‚Äôm feeling it
[0:16:11] <otakon17> god asking which is better is like asking what's tastier: steak or lobster
[0:16:11] <SinnerEbru> i never played either, so i appreciate the nuance üëç
[0:16:13] <RyuuAoi> Back to the 90s
[0:16:14] <RockinChocobo> Pixel Remasters are pretty decent
[0:16:14] <otakon17> and like, BOTH are amazing
[0:16:15] <+healnavi> bugs everywhere
[0:16:16] <%tyler274> @MurseJOCO its the prelude lol
[0:16:17] <iacus_> The Holy Trinity is: Chrono Trigger, FF6 and Earthbound
[0:16:22] <cheapdoc> Shout out to all the people born in 2002 that are now 20
[0:16:25] <RockinChocobo> also best version of FFIII, don't @ me. :U
[0:16:26] <alrobot2014> i do wonder if they fixed the old bugs
[0:16:27] <inorwise> sonic adventure 2 super sonic transformation is the ultimate of that
[0:16:30] <downmagic> gotta slam down your 40 bucks at funkoland
[0:16:31] <MurseJOCO> @tyler274 ahh yes yess!!
[0:16:32] <%ChillaxingJay> both ff6 and ct are god tier snes rpgs
[0:16:32] <ErikFeral> Running it back to the 90s
[0:16:32] <%xjn_> turn on streamer mode
[0:16:33] <+Yopomo> chrono trigger is my fave out of that bunch @iacus_
[0:16:34] <BreakfastSampler> ff6 is retroactively worse because the villain is The Joker Baby
[0:16:35] <@Solidus_113> sync test?
[0:16:36] <kpkulmala> it's kind of wild to think that this and FFX were only 7 years apart
[0:16:37] <otakon17> @iacus_ I would have said Dragon Quest to be honest but Earthbound is good too
[0:16:37] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Ah good old snes VI where evasion is broken, and blind does nothing
[0:16:39] <@Solidus_113> now do it again LUL
[0:16:39] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus I might have missed this, coming in late, but im curious as to your experience with Final Fantasy (the series) cohhHmm

[0:17:04] <%TheHateFish> @SinnerEbru What's better, creme brul√©e or baked alaska? 100% personal preference, but both are the result of exceptional skill and artistry, and both are goddamned great.

[0:18:36] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Have you seen Dissidia, Kefka is a very pretty man
[0:18:38] <alrobot2014> @leith_aziz auto only on for the intro
[0:18:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Biggs?
[0:18:46] <leith_aziz> I've never play any FF game, coincidentaly
[0:18:50] <otakon17> this is the FIRST instance of Biggs and Wedge in the FF series
[0:18:54] <ErikFeral> @DreyfussFrost why would anyone remove the opening credits?!?
[0:18:57] <SilverFaustX> woolie never played this ?
[0:18:57] <+Mkingston> I've never finished this or any 2D FF game
[0:18:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> oh man Reggie is the veteran this time?! let's go!!
[0:18:58] <hasansviewcountbot> Sephiroth has the best villain theme
[0:18:58] <%mr_sups> So Reggie is coming in with experience
[0:19:01] <otakon17> @ErikFeral I have no idea
[0:19:02] <%ChillaxingJay> so reggie played this? cool
[0:19:04] <ErikFeral> yeah
[0:19:04] <crocodile_t34rz> 9 the best!
[0:19:05] <velgaduere> PauseChamp
[0:19:06] <+RigmaroleHM> YEYEYE
[0:19:09] <ErikFeral> here it is!!
[0:19:10] <+sherndon226> Man I love 9
[0:19:10] <+healnavi> so the good part of 9 LUL
[0:19:11] <cj_art> i love how winter-y this game feels
[0:19:12] <+crybirb> @WoolieVersus but from the ones you played is it your favorite Reggie?
[0:19:12] <%Xelhesia> 6
[0:19:12] <Vashido22> 9 is so good
[0:19:12] <%CavemanInCave> 8 bb
[0:19:12] <alexandrecau> who played all ff
[0:19:13] <%parazoa42> 4 is great too
[0:19:13] <@Solidus_113> 9 is great
[0:19:13] <agadejobi> Finish FF9!
[0:19:14] <%holydeviant1> It's the FF with the most prominence in 15, which is basically FF Smash Brothers
[0:19:14] <otakon17> 9 is great
[0:19:14] <+sherndon226> It has such a strong art design
[0:19:15] <downmagic> 5 6 7 9
[0:19:17] <Garnetguy98> Reggie knows what‚Äôs up!
[0:19:18] <%livlinn> NO TEN!? OhMyDog
[0:19:18] <twoto858> 9 is really good
[0:19:19] <+GallowsDrop> 6 7 9 or 14
[0:19:19] <badugidugi> FF6 then FFT !!
[0:19:19] <nakunattakage> 9 is phenomenal
[0:19:20] <%DreyfussFrost> I have played every, and yes, it should be. FF6 was not topped until Shadowbringers very recently.
[0:19:20] <+solzan2000> 9 is Kreygasm
[0:19:22] <otakon17> 10 is good
[0:19:23] <+EdgySalad> 9 is good
[0:19:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 10 was my first and it's grear
[0:19:25] <JoshuaSXM> Tactics lol
[0:19:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 8 and i will die on this hill
[0:19:25] <%TheHateFish> 6 vs 7 vs 9 is an argument for the ages
[0:19:25] <+GallowsDrop> or FFT
[0:19:26] <RyuuAoi> Okay Reggie a fan
[0:19:26] <iacus_> My first FF was 7, but I went back and like 6 WAAAY more
[0:19:26] <+solzan2000> FF8 is Kreygasm
[0:19:27] <Novillion> 9 is my #1
[0:19:28] <Momofukku> 10 is good
[0:19:28] <+crybirb> FF6 is the best then Tactics Ogre :3
[0:19:28] <%oneimportantthing> 9 is super underrated
[0:19:29] <%arkv01> yo team squall in a coma hollah
[0:19:29] <marvel877> I really got to get around to playing 9.
[0:19:29] <DXLelouch24> i say this as a HUGE 7 fan. SIX IS THE GOAT
[0:19:30] <%benupde287> FF12 is no slouch
[0:19:30] <Teradyne87> I love 9 a lot because I started with 1
[0:19:34] <velgaduere> damn. straight up no credits
[0:19:38] <%Mathochism> The actual correct answer is 14: Shadowbringers.
[0:19:38] <%jepupu> Babby's First Final Fantasy = their favorite Final Fantasy
[0:19:39] <%Xelhesia> 6>7=14>9>4>5
[0:19:39] <downmagic> 4 was good too
[0:19:39] <Garnetguy98> 6 7 and 9 are my thee favs
[0:19:39] <Momofukku> I like 12
[0:19:40] <%mr_sups> 7 is odd. 9 is the pinicle of the PSX stuff tho
[0:19:41] <crocodile_t34rz> didn't like ff6 as much.
[0:19:42] <SlangPunk> Ff5 as well, big ups to early 90s ff
[0:19:42] <leith_aziz> Any FF from 4 to 10 is a point of discussion when it comes to "best" cohhNotes
[0:19:43] <otakon17> 9 is like, the LOVE LETTER to the original first five games
[0:19:48] <agadejobi> What version of FF6 is this?
[0:19:50] <+SolidusRex> My top 5 are XIV, VII, V, IX, and VI
[0:19:50] <%Juriasu> Triple Triad Kappa
[0:19:50] <%andre11dr> 10 is pretty good, there's just some......parts
[0:19:51] <+polothegreatest> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[0:19:52] <+sherndon226> going back to play 1 is like man this is the protoplasmic shit
[0:19:53] <leith_aziz> That's what I've seen from the community
[0:19:55] <+EdgySalad> The only thing that topped FFVI for me was XIV
[0:19:56] <+skyshinecrusader> Gotta respect my boy Cecil
[0:19:56] <%arkv01> triple triad PICK UP YOUR CARDS STOP CRYING
[0:19:57] <%boletoh> I've beaten 4 & 13 and Mystic Quest lmao
[0:19:58] <GeltonZ> @agadejobi Pixel Remaster
[0:19:58] <+RushUnplugged> unfair of ff6 to frontload the best thing in it, Terra's Theme, right away
[0:19:59] <%tyler274> 9 is powerful but FUCK TETRA MASTER
[0:20:00] <downmagic> 8 was kinda trash
[0:20:01] <%DreyfussFrost> Excluding 14, 6 > 5 > 12 > 7 > 10 IMHO, but all are good except 2, 8, 13, and 15.
[0:20:01] <%benupde287> 12 zodiac age, bby
[0:20:02] <TheAzureOracle> You would probably love 9 tbh
[0:20:03] <dd44dostivei> best FF is chrono trigger
[0:20:06] <iacus_> @agadejobi pixel remaster
[0:20:09] <otakon17> @tyler274 agreed, hate that card game
[0:20:10] <+sherndon226> 15 is like this flawed thing I still love
[0:20:11] <T_Sasquatch> Ohhh weird i literally tried playing this on my phone with an emulator but i didn't know where the fuck to go early on and i didn't want to depend on a wiki
[0:20:11] <@Menitta> I think by a technicality my favorite FF is Type 0
[0:20:13] <%DreyfussFrost> @dd44dostivei This
[0:20:13] <+solzan2000> 8 is godlike
[0:20:13] <+Mkingston> 9 is my fave. I will always have a soft sport for 8 because it was my first. Most people say 7 because it was their first.
[0:20:14] <marvel877> I played some of 1, but those NES era RPGs, man, they're a slog.
[0:20:15] <+sherndon226> chillin with the boys
[0:20:16] <%gan_n_dorf> FF12 is so different, there's a massive sense of scale and size that just makes you feel like One Guy in the world
[0:20:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @arkv01 you didnt have to break that kids cards bro damn LUL
[0:20:17] <+crybirb> 10 would be a GREAT one if they just REMOVED Tidus, Wakka and Seymour entirely
[0:20:20] <otakon17> yeah you can't skip this
[0:20:22] <theanora1> 14 is now the best, but 6, 7, and 9 are considered the best
[0:20:22] <+pectusumbra> @RushUnplugged It's a Leitmotif
[0:20:22] <inorwise> astute observation reginold
[0:20:23] <SilverFaustX> FeelsStrongMan
[0:20:25] <%oneimportantthing> 9 perfected PSX graphics
[0:20:25] <brunoberserk> FF8 ? you mean triple triad simulator ?
[0:20:27] <RyuuAoi> Does Reggie know about Parasite Eve?
[0:20:28] <+HereComestheChief> 15 has flaws, but I still love it in spite of them
[0:20:28] <nakunattakage> limesDance limesDance limesDance
[0:20:29] <+Asi9> 12 is suuuuper underrated
[0:20:29] <%X2Eliah> chrono trigger is the best final fantasy
[0:20:30] <@Menitta> haven't touched any other besides XV which is...it tries it's best
[0:20:30] <Sp3ctre48> 6, 9 and 10 are my favorites
[0:20:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @crybirb YOU TAKE THAT BACK
[0:20:32] <Ipsenscastle> @Mkingston same
[0:20:34] <BoneofMalkav> Everytime I hear Terra's Theme I keep thinking it's a soldier's funeral
[0:20:34] <%ozzrabbit> And the NieR raids in XIV
[0:20:35] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Can you tell me about that game? I know little of it and am curious cohhNotes
[0:20:37] <Jnkolm> 4 is my favorite but 6 is for sure the best
[0:20:37] <%thesickestzak> Really liked the boys in 15
[0:20:37] <BoneofMalkav> o7
[0:20:38] <+Yopomo> mine go 5>6>3>7>4>9>1>8>2
[0:20:38] <downmagic> 9 was rad
[0:20:40] <Treasure_Vault> Cultural osmosis
[0:20:41] <+Yopomo> for the old ones
[0:20:42] <+PositivelyNick> woolieGLORY woolieGIRLS woolieGLORY woolieGIRLS
[0:20:42] <+DoctorDerp388> oh is that a REMASTERED OST I HEAR
[0:20:43] <+crybirb> @Reverend_Roscoe Never they are the triad of SHIT
[0:20:44] <Teradyne87> There's a reason this game has a music player available from first boot up
[0:20:44] <%thesickestzak> 9 is very good
[0:20:45] <+healnavi> @crybirb 19 would be great if you removed the focus of the story???
[0:20:46] <toulon_somberjade> 6 was my proper first but my first was Mystic Quest
[0:20:47] <kulmoth> I love 9
[0:20:47] <+skyshinecrusader> Playing dissida as a kid really gave me a great appreciation for the series
[0:20:47] <Garnetguy98> 4 is sooooo good
[0:20:48] <+GallowsDrop> you can't escape 6 it's too important
[0:20:48] <%holydeviant1> The real genius of Final Fantasy is that it's a name that allows for massive experimentation and creativity. It doesn't experience series rot.
[0:20:49] <$MonsterEnvy> I really like xiv
[0:20:50] <%TheHateFish> Personally, it's 9, followed by, in order, 14, 7, 6, 4, 1, 12, 10, power gap, 10-2, 13-2, 15, then I haven't played the rest. Not including side-games.
[0:20:50] <SilverFaustX> the town is light up
[0:20:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> 9 is also very good
[0:20:52] <otakon17> 15 feels disjointed to me but I love the pseudo realistic/fantasy setting
[0:20:53] <Parasocial_Interaction> 9 was fantastic
[0:20:53] <%DreyfussFrost> @Yopomo SeemsGood
[0:20:54] <%tyler274> 12 is great but noticeably unfinished
[0:20:55] <%andre11dr> I played 1,4,6,7,8,10, four hours of 13,14,
[0:20:57] <alrobot2014> if the Nvidia leaks turn out to be true maybe we'll get a 9 remake
[0:21:04] <+crybirb> @healnavi Yunna and the cycle of sacrifice is the focus of the story :)
[0:21:04] <otakon17> GOD LOOK AT THOSE PIXELS <3
[0:21:04] <%jepupu> I've beaten... 6, 7, 10 and 14 (ARR&exp MSQ anyway)
[0:21:06] <Scorchfield> 9 is big on nostalgia for the earlier games in the series
[0:21:06] <nakunattakage> the sound of the wind Kreygasm

[0:23:10] <toulon_somberjade> Also this game has a LOT OF things that can be lost forever
[0:23:11] <%DreyfussFrost> I feel foolish for every being concerned about this LP. Didn't know Reggie was such a god LUL
[0:23:12] <+Jiggisnipe> @crybirb it actually doesn't. Yuna probably just goes through with it like dad. Replay the game
[0:23:13] <MurseJOCO> @damashi_the_kaotic SAME! HYPED
[0:23:14] <%DreyfussFrost> ever*
[0:23:14] <otakon17> @skyshinecrusader FF7
[0:23:24] <iggeh> extremely important characters
[0:23:27] <Treasure_Vault> There's some stuff that Woolie shouldn't be spoiled on, but did they ever fix evade?
[0:23:28] <otakon17> you are Magitek Elite ????
[0:23:30] <+crybirb> @otakon17 It doesn't need to keep going, you can give a different justification for it being broke. Tidus just awkwards the entire plot.
[0:23:32] <leith_aziz> @Jiggisnipe Tidus is the main character, right? Yeah no, as much as he might annoy, he brings more good than bad. cohhHmm
[0:23:32] <%DreyfussFrost> @skyshinecrusader Probably still 7.
[0:23:34] <%RyTYoung> @skyshinecrusader gotta be FF 7 Badger Wedge Kappa
[0:23:42] <+crybirb> @Jiggisnipe You legit think he is a good character and he was a good justification for the cycle being broken?
[0:23:49] <%mr_sups> https://clips.twitch.tv/FancySuccessfulTurnipNomNom-IYCrQ5LUJy_aGuGG
[0:23:54] <CruxAustralis> not every time
[0:23:56] <%xjn_> His ass is fine
[0:23:58] <+TheLocalRival> Hey Woolie! Why do you always do the 8 count? Sorry if it‚Äôs a dumb question but I‚Äôm just curious
[0:24:00] <+RushUnplugged> @Jiggisnipe just take the L boy, you're wrong and multiple people told you
[0:24:01] <%andre11dr> It's wierd that they made her blonde later, i guess they thought green hair was to wierd
[0:24:02] <$StaceMcGate> most times they go strong and live
[0:24:03] <+sherndon226> Why are we still here? Just to suffer? - biggs and wedge
[0:24:05] <badugidugi> first of a few star wars references :D
[0:24:06] <otakon17> @crybirb Tidus also works as the audience surrogate in explaining Spira to the player to boot
[0:24:06] <+healnavi> Kappa whaaat? nooo. They're fine.
[0:24:09] <+pectusumbra> That is CORRECT
[0:24:12] <otakon17> Evasion was BROKEN in the original game
[0:24:12] <RockinChocobo> You think Square likes Star Wars? I think Square likes Star Wars. Kappa
[0:24:13] <%tyler274> oh man this game is fucked
[0:24:14] <otakon17> they fixed it
[0:24:14] <+KingRipoff1> Biggs and wedge are still alive in xiv at least!
[0:24:15] <Vashido22> yup
[0:24:16] <%Xelhesia> YES
[0:24:18] <otakon17> THEY FIXED ALL OF THEM
[0:24:18] <+pectusumbra> They ARE FIXED
[0:24:18] <+Nekros4442> @andre11dr Amano always had her as blonde
[0:24:19] <%DreyfussFrost> In the original. They're fixed now.
[0:24:20] <OldManDeckardCain> you can be immune to magic LUL
[0:24:20] <Scorchfield> yep, it was bugged
[0:24:21] <%ChillaxingJay> yes
[0:24:22] <+SolGainer> Vanish + Doom LUL
[0:24:22] <RockinChocobo> Still works more than the FF1
[0:24:23] <+healnavi> probably a lot
[0:24:23] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @andre11dr She's blonde, because Amno loves blondes
[0:24:24] <velgaduere> time to look that shit up
[0:24:24] <otakon17> Evasion WORKS
[0:24:24] <%Demoli_PT> they fixed EVERYTHING
[0:24:25] <%TheHateFish> @TheLocalRival It's to make sure the audio is synced for the VOD
[0:24:25] <$StaceMcGate> they fixed for remaster
[0:24:25] <+crybirb> @otakon17 You can have a different character to do that without being that annoying, they did that before.
[0:24:28] <@Solidus_113> @TheLocalRival sync test because the audio is being recorded separate from the game feed
[0:24:28] <%DreyfussFrost> They ARE fixed in this version.
[0:24:30] <Vashido22> I still wish the new sprites were made to match how the characters look in their chart
[0:24:30] <Novillion> Oh neat they are fixed here
[0:24:30] <+LastHazzerd> which bugs DO you fix in a remaster
[0:24:31] <%holydeviant1> that is certainly The question
[0:24:31] <RockinChocobo> XIV has best Biggs and Wedge
[0:24:32] <AbnormalVoid> Vanish Doom was so stupid LUL
[0:24:33] <otakon17> EVASION WORKS
[0:24:34] <leith_aziz> @Jiggisnipe Now, now, there is no "wrong" opinion as much as we like to argue. We keept it civil, I hope pickyAYAYA
[0:24:36] <DevilHands_> Assuming its based on the mobile version, all of them
[0:24:36] <agadejobi> I'm sure they got no more Vanish and Doom
[0:24:38] <iacus_> odd menu
[0:24:38] <toulon_somberjade> I know vanish got fixed since advanced
[0:24:40] <+Jiggisnipe> @crybirb he's a fine character. and yes he and Jecht as outsiders pushes lead alot of people to break the cycle
[0:24:41] <Zeif00> what is happening in chat LUL
[0:24:41] <+pectusumbra> I think the only thing that still works is psycho cyan but you gotta WORK for it
[0:24:42] <Treasure_Vault> Whole new game
[0:24:43] <%MisterRockett> @thelocalrival it's a sync test. they record their audio separately and need to align it with the footage. counting with the menu makes it easy.
[0:24:46] <+sherndon226> which are bugs and which are features
[0:24:48] <iacus_> oh there seems to be a minumap
[0:24:49] <+LastHazzerd> nice smoke
[0:24:50] <AbnormalVoid> it's remade in a whole new engine
[0:24:51] <%DreyfussFrost> This version should have all the fixes from Advance.

[0:51:45] <Rojo_Hou> Sonic Chronicles was so bad. The sound design was garbage
[0:51:45] <%Juriasu> oh yeah
[0:51:45] <yamidemon666> So good Kreygasm
[0:51:46] <ErikFeral> "can you imagine if it sucked" nah, this was in the era when Square still knew what they were doing
[0:51:46] <BoneofMalkav> More like Dork Brotherhood LUL
[0:51:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> DONT TALK ABOUT IT
[0:51:46] <cj_art> are we allowed to talk about  Secret of Mana's
[0:51:46] <ArkSeaside> I watched Mr Feel's stream of it and oof
[0:51:47] <%emMmDeeKay> it was made by BIOWARE
[0:51:48] <Blank9> Oh my god it‚Äôs so bad
[0:51:48] <+InspectEIement> ken penders sued them for that game
[0:51:50] <LoreKeeper_Thal> fucking bioware
[0:51:50] <Saltmeisterr> ITS PENIS MUSIC
[0:51:52] <+ShinobiPhoenix> only technically made by BioWare
[0:51:52] <RyuuAoi> When?
[0:51:53] <Jaxnos> doot doot deet deet - the soundtrack of Dark Brotherhood
[0:51:54] <SaltyAzteca> YOU MUST NOT BRING IT TO LIFE LUL
[0:51:55] <InXplotch> That game has atrocious sounds
[0:51:55] <+LastHazzerd> Biowear magic
[0:51:56] <agadejobi> They lost all of the music right before it was supposed to come out
[0:51:57] <otakon17> Sonic and the Dark Brotherhood it's BLEEPS AND BLOOPS that got SCRAPPED from the actual music theme
[0:51:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Sonic chronicals dark brotherhood yeah
[0:51:59] <Momofukku> Sonic? The Hedgehog?
[0:52:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Matt did a What Happun
[0:52:03] <+Javaa01> Bioware magic
[0:52:03] <%xerotwo> LUL
[0:52:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's worse than the clowns farting in your basement
[0:52:06] <yamidemon666> LUL
[0:52:06] <otakon17> it had to do with PENDERS
[0:52:07] <ArkSeaside> Secret Of Mana is the most overrated shit
[0:52:07] <+healnavi> they had one week
[0:52:11] <haitakaa> I think it was a bug or something LUL
[0:52:11] <+Deekman> made in Edmonton
[0:52:11] <%andre11dr> It was actually unfinished
[0:52:16] <%teefpal> They had one week
[0:52:16] <+SolGainer> They're shitty midis of the Sonic 3 soundtrack
[0:52:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> they fucked up and had to redo the whole soundtrack like a week before launch
[0:52:18] <otakon17> friggin' Penders...
[0:52:19] <Fathuran> @ozzrabbit I recognize the beat butthe GATE theme is just the ff chocobo song
[0:52:20] <ErikFeral> the one sonic game with Bad Music? Does that mean the gameplay was GOOD!?
[0:52:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Matt McMuscles already did the What Happun on Sonic Chronicles
[0:52:22] <linSP> @arkseaside hard agree
[0:52:23] <@Menitta> Sonic routinely has a good soundtrack and THEY FUCKED THAT UP TOO
[0:52:25] <+Jiggisnipe> wow
[0:52:27] <Vyneci> Which is a cardinal sin when it comes to Sonic
[0:52:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @majindusto
[0:52:30] <velgaduere> LEGENDARY BIOWARE CRUNCH
[0:52:30] <Rojo_Hou> They wanted to use remixes of old sonic tracks but they had some sort of issue getting it all done in time
[0:52:30] <Ner234> ost any%
[0:52:33] <haitakaa> or wait the Resident Evil music was an error
[0:52:35] <Teradyne87> That map is a nice new addition
[0:52:36] <otakon17> yeah it's the ONE Sonic game with a shitty OST
[0:52:39] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Bioware "MAGIC"
[0:52:39] <RyuuAoi> They couldn't get Michael Jackson on that one.
[0:52:39] <+Jiggisnipe> it's KOTOR on steroids
[0:52:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Reggies Face LUL
[0:52:41] <%Mr_Pylon> Bioware magic
[0:52:42] <ArkSeaside> yeah dont worry about that
[0:52:43] <@Menitta> HEY BIOWARE MAGIC
[0:52:43] <yamidemon666> LUL
[0:52:47] <agadejobi> THAT'S CRONO TRIGGER
[0:52:48] <XScytheMata> so they did an andromeda before andromeda?
[0:52:52] <+SolGainer> That's not an issue in this game
[0:52:53] <otakon17> man I miss old Bioware
[0:53:03] <leith_aziz> I dont know if I want a "generic" battle theme for RPG's, because RPG's are long, so one that you're gonna hear a lot, despite how good the track is, always runs the risk of becoming annoying cohhHmm
[0:53:04] <ArkSeaside> oh hey reggie's on hip guiding duty
[0:53:04] <agadejobi> It is, but only in some areas
[0:53:05] <%bevyrage> crono trigger is the one with the chest management. that isn't a thing in FF6
[0:53:05] <Alzero83> are you using the Mystic quest font?
[0:53:06] <Teradyne87> Can't open the really great chest here yet
[0:53:11] <Estuko> Reggie the guide or using guide? purely out of curiosity
[0:53:12] <%andre11dr> They literally just used the midi presets, there probably wasn't even any mastering
[0:53:19] <dontfeedthechocobo> üëÄ
[0:53:19] <+sherndon226> I want the timeline where Bioware actually works on something for 2 years instead of like 18 months
[0:53:20] <otakon17> you cannot do anything with that...yet
[0:53:24] <leith_aziz> If you can make a new battle track for every new area, that's great pickyEZ
[0:53:24] <Jaxnos> it is a thing bevy. just not as rampant.
[0:53:26] <otakon17> SEE
[0:53:28] <otakon17> Evasion WORKS
[0:53:30] <%ozzrabbit> And now it‚Äôs bothering me, because this sounds so much like the music that played during the ‚ÄúGentle Deadmen‚Äù Fate you do for Hildibrand!
[0:53:31] <%xerotwo> B L O C K
[0:53:31] <otakon17> I told yoU!
[0:53:31] <ArkSeaside> have we already reminded him to remind Woolie to use magic in that one scripted fight?
[0:53:32] <dontfeedthechocobo> this is kinda rare lmao
[0:53:33] <SaltyAzteca> Parries in this cave
[0:53:33] <%xjn_> Block serotonin
[0:53:33] <alrobot2014> does this game ever teach you how to multitarget magic?
[0:53:34] <%DreyfussFrost> These chests in particular have a good upgrade, but you're never going to miss anything absolutely vital.  Missed a potential auto-protect and auto-shell relic later.
[0:53:38] <+sherndon226> parry
[0:53:40] <otakon17> NO
[0:53:41] <%Juriasu> no it¬®s just splits damage
[0:53:42] <+Jiggisnipe> @Estuko he has an ipad they said
[0:53:42] <otakon17> it does NOT
[0:53:43] <alrobot2014> costs the same
[0:53:44] <agadejobi> Nope
[0:53:44] <+InspectEIement> no lol
[0:53:44] <haisho> it'll cut the damage I think
[0:53:46] <lotharrio> Well, evasion has been fixed.
[0:53:46] <CruxAustralis> nope but does less damage
[0:53:46] <+Wildpandaman> this remix music very jazy
[0:53:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> no, it just splits damage
[0:53:49] <%DreyfussFrost> Same cost, reduced damage
[0:53:50] <ArkSeaside> nope just does about 40%
[0:53:51] <shiny_prinny> same cost, damage down
[0:53:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> Xenoblade Chronicle X has one of the shittiest battle themes ever
[0:53:55] <otakon17> the MP cost of a spell stays the same but the damage is DIVIDED among the targets
[0:53:55] <Tydemore> alkJergens
[0:53:59] <Estuko> @Jiggisnipe gotcha I got here like 6 minutes ago a little late lol
[0:54:03] <@Solidus_113> game good
[0:54:07] <InXplotch> yes, strong single target or weaker aoe
[0:54:09] <%arkv01> it makes sense! Law of energy conservation with magic!
[0:54:09] <Tydemore> vraiment Woolie
[0:54:10] <agadejobi> Is this Woolie's first classic FF game?
[0:54:12] <otakon17> oh no
[0:54:16] <crocodile_t34rz> AoE vs. Single nuke. it's great.
[0:54:16] <$MonsterEnvy> @agadejobi yes
[0:54:16] <+InspectEIement> @CaptainPileDriver the city hub music is actually atrocius too
[0:54:18] <deviljhojho_> lookin cool
[0:54:21] <alrobot2014> @agadejobi yep
[0:54:22] <jimgimp> The boss theme from Lufia II sounds almost identical to this, that game came out after this one
[0:54:23] <%jepupu> I liked that better than having to play around with All materia and such
[0:54:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[0:54:24] <otakon17> dat sax of knocking out
[0:54:25] <XScytheMata> that is an awesome mechanic

[0:54:26] <%AngryAsian5> Stupid sexy caves
[0:54:28] <TimeWanderer> Concussed

[1:01:02] <ArkSeaside> these are the series standard moogles, Ivalice games have the weirdos
[1:01:02] <otakon17> but you don't have MOG

[1:01:12] <brainfreeze91> Interesting seeing so many people familiar with XIV but not this game, and seeing all the parallels
[1:01:14] <otakon17> IIRC the Spear weapons can do full damage from the back row
[1:01:18] <TimeWanderer> @Xero_J A few hours ago!
[1:01:18] <Estuko> I should level Mog in DFFOO just for this occassion ... lol

[1:01:32] <leith_aziz> Optimal pickyFocus
[1:01:32] <ArkSeaside> @otakon17 nah, they just do double damage if used with Jump
[1:01:32] <otakon17> equips the stuff with the best ATK/DEF stats
[1:01:33] <ScrumDyna> The Moogles don't play no games.
[1:01:33] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @brainfreeze91 it's a lot more common than you think
[1:01:34] <+pectusumbra> BUT, certain stuff does not count

[1:01:48] <Vashido22> its nice to use optimal then edit
[1:01:49] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus  it only optimizes physical attacks for weapons and defence for armors
[1:01:49] <linSP> it‚Äôs not always the best best
[1:01:52] <Sp3ctre48> *was
[1:01:54] <lotharrio> Just pure attack and defense. Stuff that boosts other stats are ignored.
[1:01:55] <XScytheMata> kupos using spears sounds like the cutest yet deadliest thing ever LUL
[1:01:56] <+Byr0nX> "Im glad I came to work strapped, kupo"

[1:08:27] <%Juriasu> wait only waits when you are in sub menus
[1:08:27] <haitakaa> it only applies to inner menus
[1:08:28] <+ShinobiPhoenix> wait is IN menu
[1:08:29] <haitakaa> like items
[1:08:29] <+sherndon226> guard leader says "no more moogles send them all back"
[1:08:30] <+Toficque> mogs are only temporary members so it doesn't matter
[1:08:32] <alrobot2014> @SomeOtherNeb there's no difficulty selection in the older games
[1:08:33] <otakon17> Wait only "waits" while you're in inventory menus and choosing magic
[1:08:34] <%andre11dr> This is harder than i remember, LUL
[1:08:34] <lotharrio> Wait stops if you're in a submenu, like Item or Magic.

[1:08:37] <%DreyfussFrost> "Wait" only pauses combat in submenus and target selection
[1:08:37] <%Juriasu> rip elixir
[1:08:37] <Scorchfield> Wait means time stops in sub menus
[1:08:38] <crimsonharvest> 'wait' means its waiting while your cursor finger is inside a non-top level window
[1:08:39] <dontfeedthechocobo> good choice.
[1:08:40] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> NotLikeThis
[1:08:40] <Teradyne87> Wait will only pause time in a menu selection

[1:14:35] <+SolGainer> it is
[1:14:36] <Dopamien> quadruplets WutFace
[1:14:36] <SomeOtherNeb> it is, it's just submenus
[1:14:37] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Yes, to select spells or items.
[1:14:37] <haisho> it's for submenus
[1:14:39] <%teefpal> It is
[1:14:40] <+pectusumbra> when you are in the menus
[1:14:40] <CruxAustralis> submenus
[1:14:41] <StrayDogsStrut> Wait only works in menu selection.
[1:14:41] <alrobot2014> Time is stopped during Magic Submenu
[1:14:42] <shiny_prinny> you have to be in the submenu
[1:14:42] <nakunattakage> you have to be in submenus I believe
[1:14:42] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> jaydSAD
[1:14:43] <crimsonharvest> Yes, when youre inside the item or spell sub-menu
[1:14:43] <lotharrio> Spells or Items.
[1:14:43] <badugidugi> In submenus its true
[1:14:44] <Scorchfield> yes it is, time stops in submenus
[1:14:44] <majindusto> ARE YOU?
[1:14:45] <%Reverend_Roscoe> submenus
[1:14:47] <%tyler274> its like 13 sentinels
[1:14:48] <otakon17> ACTIONS will still happen
[1:14:50] <+healnavi> it only waits while you're in the submenu
[1:14:50] <profligateex> yeah it's just for submenus
[1:14:51] <$MonsterEnvy> You can can only freely check in sub menus
[1:14:51] <InXplotch> Wait mode is stopped only when you are in a submenu
[1:14:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> while selecting items and spells
[1:14:52] <%andrewofbob> Just not in top-level menu
[1:14:52] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> When in the attack submenu
[1:14:53] <BoneofMalkav> It's true in Submenues
[1:14:53] <+Grayhammatter> submenus i guess?
[1:14:55] <+self_harmonize> only during spells and item selects
[1:14:55] <Jnkolm> the spell or item MENU, not the battle menu itself
[1:14:57] <Teradyne87> You've got to be choosing something in your menu
[1:14:57] <%Mr_Pylon> You have to make an initial selection for Wait to happen,
[1:14:59] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Wait mode pauses in SUBmenus and target selection. You cannot pause in the base menu.
[1:15:00] <haisho> when you're choosing items or magic it'll stop ATB
[1:15:01] <iacus_> only when you opne a menu like magic
[1:15:01] <CruxAustralis> selecting a spell or item
[1:15:01] <crimsonharvest> not in top level battle screen
[1:15:03] <otakon17> if you're on the MAIN command menu, it's real time
[1:15:05] <%pi_in_the_sci> it only waits in submenus, so only when you're picking the stuff
[1:15:06] <KobeTeeth90> ATB stops Moving but Actions still happen
[1:15:09] <@Solidus_113> when you select, not when you're waiting on ATB
[1:15:10] <%Juriasu> same as chrono trigger
[1:15:15] <otakon17> bc submenus are FULL of stuff later on
[1:15:24] <SomeOtherNeb> it's the same as FF7's wait mode I think
[1:15:24] <lotharrio> There's also mid-battle pause.
[1:15:25] <%DreyfussFrost> The top level lets time pass so that you can let another character act first.
[1:15:26] <linSP> the animation still plays
[1:15:26] <InXplotch> You ust have to hover an attack and you can stop
[1:15:27] <profligateex> best dip into a menu, boy
[1:15:28] <%Prevot> this is why I fucking hate ATB
[1:15:28] <%andrewofbob> Time is passing, and so are moogles' lives
[1:15:29] <alrobot2014> If you can see the ATB meter moving, time is moving
[1:15:31] <Dopamien> AngelThump
[1:15:34] <otakon17> like you can select "items" and just sit there without worrying about getting constantly pounded by enemies
[1:15:36] <+dougtert> it's easy enough to get used to
[1:15:37] <enerkaizer> I'm so thankfull atb has died out pretty much as a system. never liked it, felt like the opposite of what you wanted to do in a Turn-based RPG
[1:15:38] <InXplotch> you can also hits start to pause at any time I think
[1:15:41] <T_Sasquatch> This why atb sucks ass
[1:15:51] <profligateex> moisten them feet, boy
[1:15:52] <Speckster42> looks crisp
[1:15:57] <XScytheMata> kinda convulated at first, but easy to hang on
[1:16:00] <otakon17> a save point!
[1:16:01] <@Solidus_113> ATB is good, just react faster Kappa
[1:16:04] <+SolGainer> HALL OF TUTORIAL MEN
[1:16:05] <Estuko> LUL
[1:16:10] <iacus_> theres no other way it could have worked otherwise the bars would never fill
[1:16:20] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no the healing noise is the same as a FF14 notification noise, it's weriding me out
[1:16:23] <%andrewofbob> ATB: all bosses are menu bosses
[1:16:30] <otakon17> oh yeah, stats don't(normally) go up when you level up; just HP/MP
[1:16:32] <%Prevot> ATB is fence sitting centrism shit, pick action or turn based or fuck off
[1:16:39] <%DreyfussFrost> FFX is definitely the perfection of "Wait" style ATB, but ATB is still VASTLY superior to pure, your party/enemy party, turn-based.
[1:16:44] <Jnkolm> atb on wait isn't bad. There are times you want to wait so you can double up on stuff. like casting cure after using a revive
[1:16:44] <otakon17> your ATK/DEF is entirely dependent on your equipment
[1:16:55] <XScytheMata> i'll take FF10 battle system, tho. Best RPG battle system ever
[1:16:56] <+pectusumbra> correct
[1:17:00] <otakon17> so you need MULTIPLE sleeping bags for a party
[1:17:05] <badugidugi> @otakon17 damage calculations take into account character level too though
[1:17:11] <%tyler274> let me script my party like ff12 tho
[1:17:12] <+notgoodatnamessorry> personally I prefer when I game let's you choose, I feel like it's just a win win
[1:17:13] <profligateex> the ether chamberpot
[1:17:14] <+AwkwardSnails> does this remaster fix the old stat bugs?
[1:17:19] <nertiaa> you cant just all share a sleeping bag with your homies?

[1:17:22] <+SolGainer> Relics monkaS
[1:17:23] <enerkaizer> One of the reasons FF10 is my favorite gameplay wise is because it is just a good ol turned based RPG without any ATB nonsense. Every play-session is so chill
[1:17:33] <profligateex> j u n p
[1:17:35] <+cubbywolf> how can it be vastly superior if its based on opinion?

[1:17:48] <%tyler274> finding this shit later
[1:17:48] <Alzero83> Jumpu
[1:17:56] <%DreyfussFrost> @enerkaizer It is still using ATB under the hood though, it just skips to the next turn immediately and then pauses.

[1:18:14] <otakon17> @Teradyne87 go faster I assume

[1:18:32] <Dopamien> muhnsters calebW
[1:18:33] <Jnkolm> yes
[1:18:33] <enerkaizer> @DreyfussFrost so it doesn't have atb, because atb requires that the fight is constantly ony
[1:18:33] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> no
[1:18:33] <otakon17> you're in a MAIN menu
[1:18:34] <%teefpal> no

[1:18:42] <Parasocial_Interaction> Who put the dog in a box?
[1:18:44] <otakon17> ITEMS is your submenu
[1:18:44] <%Santamooo> WOLFBOX.EXE
[1:18:47] <Jnkolm> selecting enemy is wait, yes
[1:18:47] <profligateex> nah that's not a submenu
[1:18:47] <StrayDogsStrut> Thats not items or spells.
[1:18:49] <otakon17> MAGIC is your submenu
[1:18:49] <$Rafraud> YEP
[1:18:53] <juggajava> it your dog in a box
[1:18:54] <profligateex> submenus is magic or items
[1:18:54] <linSP> yup
[1:18:55] <+pectusumbra> items or magic is the consensus
[1:18:56] <@Solidus_113> it'd be cool if you could see the boss ATB
[1:18:56] <crimsonharvest> silence otakon the finger is enough
[1:18:57] <BoneofMalkav> ITEMS and MAGIC are your submenues
[1:18:57] <otakon17> that's the MAIN menu
[1:18:58] <alrobot2014> if you can see the ATB meter move, time is moving
[1:18:59] <haisho> magic or items in this case
[1:18:59] <%tyler274> they reallly need to show you the boss ATB gauge yea
[1:18:59] <+Jiggisnipe> @DreyfussFrost does it? it just seems to be turn based for each individual entity in battle and speed determines turn order
[1:18:59] <%teefpal> ITEMS or SPELLS
[1:19:00] <%DreyfussFrost> Target selection counts
[1:19:03] <MagicMoste> selecting the enemy is a submemu unless they changed it
[1:19:03] <+healnavi> attack is not a submenu
[1:19:04] <badugidugi> items/maigc menu
[1:19:04] <+pectusumbra> so if you're choosing between fire or cure, or potions or ether
[1:19:09] <velgaduere> don't worry about it

[1:20:16] <%DreyfussFrost> @Jiggisnipe Close, but in a traditional speed-based turn-based system, the fastest character gets to go first but every entity gets a turn before any repeat. In ATB it's possible for one entity to get two turns (or more) between two of anothers' which makes it more dynamic.

[1:21:08] <+anoldtoilet> cool
[1:21:09] <+Akizea> E
[1:21:11] <enerkaizer> @DreyfussFrost not correct, you can get multiple turns with a regular RPG as well if the speed/init stat for example is high enough. again, atb requires all involved parties to be permanently acting, if it doesn't do that it isn't atb
[1:21:15] <XScytheMata> look at all these copypaste npcs LUL
[1:21:18] <otakon17> box bork damage begone!

[1:22:08] <%mr_sups> This LP is gonna be great
[1:22:12] <Razeino> @dreyfussfrost There are plenty of turn based RPG‚Äôs that have dynamic turn order that allows speedy characters to attack multiple times before the big guy gets too such as Grandia 2.
[1:22:16] <lategshi> wanna open this box? LUL
[1:22:20] <+anoldtoilet> feels like it might be gba script since the tutorial actually makes sense
[1:22:22] <KyberNasse> "Where's Jerry?" "Jerry is in the hospital, the dog bit him"
[1:22:24] <%DreyfussFrost> No
[1:22:25] <%ozzrabbit> Hey, stop me if I‚Äôm wrong‚Ä¶ but isn‚Äôt Locke‚Äôs outfit the one you get from being subscribed for 5 months in XIV?
[1:22:25] <crimsonharvest> 4
[1:22:26] <alrobot2014> nope
[1:22:31] <badugidugi> no limit
[1:22:32] <AbnormalVoid> Magic and Long Range abilities aren't affected by damage
[1:22:34] <%Namillus> Nope, this ain't FF4
[1:22:36] <%andre11dr> Wanna steal my shit now ,HUH!
[1:22:39] <AbnormalVoid> by row, I mean
[1:22:47] <lotharrio> Backrow is generally the way to go.
[1:22:54] <ppi1993> god this music is so fcking goof
[1:22:56] <+anoldtoilet> nice menu
[1:22:59] <ppi1993> good
[1:23:00] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus things such as magic or bows still fire from full pwoer fromt he back row
[1:23:04] <%Demoli_PT> maces too
[1:23:10] <EngiNierXII> Is woolie a furry
[1:23:10] <+pectusumbra> and whoever is at the top of the party is who you control on the world map
[1:23:15] <SomeOtherNeb> careful, while you're in that pause menu the box wolf is getting ready
[1:23:19] <+Jiggisnipe> remember this Kappa
[1:23:21] <%DreyfussFrost> @Razeino Yeah and Grandia 2 is basically ATB, just displayed differently. All the characters are displayed on a single line instead of multiple lines. Best jRPG combat system I know of.
[1:23:21] <ChansonNoire> majinoNeko Something to Protect majinoNeko
[1:23:24] <+RealThiele> ayyyy a remaster that gets the menu font right
[1:23:30] <otakon17> https://clips.twitch.tv/ObliqueKathishRamenCoolCat-F_MXe1oKz1Lv1Beb
[1:23:34] <+InspectEIement> @RealThiele nope its a mod
[1:23:35] <%andre11dr> @enginierxii Yes but no
[1:23:37] <1zuvi> I need a final fantasy 9 playthrough xD
[1:23:38] <%arkv01> timestop Kreygasm
[1:23:40] <marvel877> that's a text mod
[1:23:41] <otakon17> @RealThiele they modded it
[1:23:45] <+RealThiele> lol oof
[1:23:48] <KobeTeeth90> Haste Kreygasm
[1:23:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> What we really needed is ff4
[1:24:02] <nyacoo> default font is a chea√º mobile game looking font
[1:24:12] <%andre11dr> Woolie will enjoy a Furry if it can punch hard
[1:24:12] <+anoldtoilet> What is the actual text mod? just a font mod or is it a full script mod
[1:24:21] <enerkaizer> FF4 is hella bland nowadays though. That game didn't age that gracefully, even the DS remaster
[1:24:21] <+pectusumbra> just a text mod
[1:24:27] <alrobot2014> font only
[1:24:29] <Teradyne87> L1 + R1
[1:24:31] <SomeOtherNeb> ah, Jojo strats
[1:24:34] <badugidugi> L1 R1
[1:24:39] <lategshi> @anoldtoilet two files, its called the "ff6 font"
[1:24:48] <%DreyfussFrost> Yes
[1:24:52] <%DreyfussFrost> You can
[1:24:57] <Teradyne87> You can change row in battle
[1:24:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:24:58] <lotharrio> Row command in combat
[1:25:00] <%andrewofbob> Takes a turn
[1:25:00] <%Namillus> You face in the direction of whatever you attack
[1:25:01] <Scorchfield> yep, Row command lets you change
[1:25:04] <haisho> yeah but it'll take forever so you're better off killing them as fast as possible
[1:25:06] <+pectusumbra> correct
[1:25:06] <CruxAustralis> yep
[1:25:08] <AbnormalVoid> yeah
[1:25:14] <%DreyfussFrost> The Row command shifts your row in combat, yeah
[1:25:18] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet that looks like the text mod for the pixel remaster, chat said this was the original game with a mod
[1:25:20] <BoneofMalkav> If you get attack from the back then your back be wack LUL
[1:25:26] <brunoberserk> is this the game , where if you try to escape battles you take double damage or something ?

[1:25:34] <badugidugi> spit some bars
[1:25:34] <%DreyfussFrost> In Pincer, it's your position relative to the side the enemy is on.

[1:25:56] <+Akizea> old dnd stuff right there I believe
[1:25:59] <Dopamien> they are double dead
[1:26:06] <+RealThiele> FF mystic quest final boss use the life spell and insta murder him
[1:26:26] <+SolGainer> These are future party member mechanics
[1:26:28] <badugidugi> tutorial semi-spoilers :O
[1:26:30] <marvel877> @RealThiele that final boss theme is great.
[1:26:39] <enerkaizer> member when RPG devs diodn't know how to properly teach new players how their game worked? LUL looking back at so many old RPG's really makes me appreciate what modern JRPG's do
[1:26:40] <+anoldtoilet> @alrobot2014 ok so the sprites ARE different and the One Guy who told me the text was the only thing changed was just one guy.
[1:26:43] <+Jiggisnipe> this tutorial is odd now that I think about it lol
[1:26:44] <otakon17> yeah these are character specific abilities
[1:26:44] <+RealThiele> oh yeah mystic quest gets dogged on but its fun
[1:26:47] <KobeTeeth90> @badugidugi it is now cuz u opend ur mouth
[1:26:48] <+pectusumbra> correct.
[1:26:52] <%arkv01> yeah its kinda weird they go over character skills that you don't have yet
[1:26:53] <Teradyne87> Future shit
[1:26:56] <badugidugi> @badugidugi Sadge my b
[1:27:00] <otakon17> the sprites are different, they have more colors and are brighter
[1:27:03] <lotharrio> Skip is valuable for Runic and Defend.
[1:27:07] <otakon17> Lore=Blue Magic
[1:27:10] <+Jiggisnipe> @enerkaizer ikr just throwing all types of stuff at you LUL
[1:27:10] <alrobot2014> @anoldtoilet yeah these are the pixel remaster sprites
[1:27:14] <+Jaromero435> You cannot reflect Lore
[1:27:19] <+anoldtoilet> cool
[1:27:23] <marvel877> @RealThiele its baby's first rpg as a gateway. worked for me, my second rpg after that one was Earthbound and then FF7.
[1:27:30] <+dougtert> this music sounds more reminiscent of FFXV than FFVI
[1:27:42] <+pectusumbra> Fun fact! In the original Invisible was BROKEN AS FUCK
[1:27:45] <%DreyfussFrost> @alrobot2014 If they thought you meant changed from the base version of Remaster, then yes the only mod they're using is the font.
[1:27:50] <+cubbywolf> ASHEN ONE
[1:27:50] <enerkaizer> @Jiggisnipe I think even the 5 hour prolog of Persona 4 is leagues and miles better then this tutorial
[1:27:53] <otakon17> @pectusumbra best way to level grind
[1:27:55] <Teradyne87> Ashy ass zombies!
[1:27:57] <otakon17> Zombie PERSISTS
[1:27:57] <%mr_sups> Get the lotion.
[1:28:01] <OldOnyx> oh man the busted shit you could do in this game
[1:28:02] <otakon17> get the cream
[1:28:02] <%arkv01> @pectusumbra yes but let them find out on their own shhh
[1:28:04] <Scorchfield> most persist
[1:28:05] <+retro_godfather> 6 def best final fantasy Kreygasm
[1:28:05] <+sherndon226> @dougtert the music for all the pixel remasters have been remixed and all have been huge improvements and bang
[1:28:06] <InXplotch> Some persist, others pass, it depends
[1:28:07] <+SolGainer> get this man some holy lotion!
[1:28:14] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> zombie fucking SUUUCKS!
[1:28:16] <+pectusumbra> @arkv01 That stuff is fixed in this game
[1:28:18] <brunoberserk> oh boy , the yunalesca fight in FFX made me HATE zombie status
[1:28:19] <marvel877> yowhatsupobamamybabyzombie!
[1:28:19] <+RealThiele> buy status fixer items
[1:28:19] <KobeTeeth90> if ur skin is Ashen u should moisturize
[1:28:19] <CruxAustralis> oh yeah the limit breaks
[1:28:22] <+Jiggisnipe> do you?
[1:28:25] <+LastHazzerd> proto limit breaks?
[1:28:27] <Teradyne87> Hidden Limit Breaks!
[1:28:27] <AbnormalVoid> Poison, Zombie, Imp, Blind and Silence remain, iirc
[1:28:28] <+Jiggisnipe> i don't think you do
[1:28:28] <otakon17> OH did someone clip the critical hit?
[1:28:29] <Jnkolm> Secret Limit Breaks feenShh
[1:28:29] <%Namillus> You'll know when it happens
[1:28:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That's the prelude to Limit Breaks
[1:28:34] <otakon17> @LastHazzerd proto limit breaks
[1:28:36] <+anoldtoilet> so this one ISNT using the Ted Woolsey script as far as i can tell
[1:28:37] <@Solidus_113> SDM
[1:28:41] <+pectusumbra> That's important for later
[1:28:46] <%Juriasu> you can't tennis is what he means
[1:28:48] <+anoldtoilet> which is cool, i prefer the modern translation
[1:28:49] <+SolGainer> Yeah those are Limit Breaks, every character in the game has a special attack they only use at critical health with a special animation
[1:28:52] <%teefpal> @anoldtoilet is that a good or bad thing?
[1:28:56] <+RealThiele> good ol self-reflect
[1:28:58] <+anoldtoilet> it depends on preference
[1:28:59] <%G_Thunders> This is the same song FFXIV uses for its login screen, didn‚Äôt know it was from FFVI
[1:29:10] <@Solidus_113> that magus sister tech
[1:29:10] <+cubbywolf> oh neat
[1:29:11] <+anoldtoilet> original has a lot of charm
[1:29:13] <%DreyfussFrost> It's not a limit on how many spells can be reflected, but how many times a single spell bounces. One bounce max.
[1:29:16] <lotharrio> @teefpal His translation is a bit sillier.
[1:29:20] <+SolGainer> @G_Thunders it's in every FF
[1:29:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> that's to prevent a neverending reflect loop
[1:29:21] <otakon17> the enemy has Reflect on
[1:29:23] <shiny_prinny> in FFX the ai was really smart about reflect
[1:29:24] <@Commando_Joe> Also you can cheat 'reflect' by casting it on your own unit since spells can only be reflected once
[1:29:25] <+pectusumbra> Lets you bypass enemy reflect
[1:29:27] <Teradyne87> Reflected spells go through a reflect
[1:29:27] <+cubbywolf> can't reflect a reflect
[1:29:28] <okamiizero> @G_Thunders Its the main theme of the series, in every FF game I believe since 1
[1:29:28] <%Namillus> Reflected spells also deal more damage
[1:29:29] <+dougtert> not saying the music is bad or anything, I just don't think it's capturing the vibe of the era
[1:29:31] <Scorchfield> yep, bypass enemy reflect by bouncing off your own reflect
[1:29:33] <stuffamiriteyea> bypasses enemy reflect
[1:29:35] <+InspectEIement> @G_Thunders dude
[1:29:35] <haisho> Reggie got it
[1:29:39] <AbnormalVoid> correct
[1:29:40] <marvel877> This song's called 'Prelude'. Its in every FF game.
[1:29:44] <+Stormzcales_Lair> BINGO
[1:29:46] <CruxAustralis> yep
[1:29:47] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:29:48] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Correct
[1:29:49] <a_mad_dragon_> yeah that was an important gimmick in ff4
[1:29:54] <BlackermanZX> 200 iq move
[1:29:56] <lotharrio> You can also double your damage against single targets, sometimes.
[1:30:02] <+thelovingfool> high physical resist
[1:30:03] <otakon17> also if you reflect a multi-target spell on your party to an enemy, IIRC it'll cast the spell 4x on the target
[1:30:04] <Parasocial_Interaction> If you more than one party member has reflect, you can aoe your own party to hit multiple times.
[1:30:06] <+InspectEIement> It astonished just how little some FFXIV players know about the other games
[1:30:08] <%DreyfussFrost> @G_Thunders Not the main theme, but yes I believe it appears in every FF.
[1:30:16] <+cubbywolf> magitech ftw
[1:30:18] <%G_Thunders> Okay, didn‚Äôt remember it from 7 or 10, which are the only other ones I‚Äôve played
[1:30:21] <KyberNasse> Chat if you zonedscummed, you are a bissssssh :)
[1:30:23] <%arkv01> yeah I never saw LBs in my first run
[1:30:28] <KyberNasse> zonescummed*
[1:30:29] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it's the main theme of the FF series, but every game has it's main theme
[1:30:30] <%kyh9> They're called Desperation Attacks here
[1:30:37] <%kyh9> It's closer to FF8 here
[1:30:40] <+Jiggisnipe> it's like 8
[1:30:40] <+hatok> in 6 Desperation Attacks on trigger at critical health
[1:30:41] <%townzzzzz> desperate limit breaks
[1:30:42] <CruxAustralis> here it's pretty much RNG
[1:30:44] <+ghostfaceninja_> every FF has the prelude, but sometimes it's so different it's almost unrecognizable, like the FFX version
[1:30:44] <+meermadon> desperation attacks are very rare, i've only seen one once
[1:30:46] <+SolGainer> It doesn't work like 7. You can go through the whole game and not see a LB
[1:30:46] <Estuko> @InspectEIement I mean, for a lot of people it's their first FF game lol
[1:30:46] <+healnavi> it goes away yes, you can't rely on them
[1:30:47] <AbnormalVoid> You'll probably never see a Desperation Attack, they're really weirdly designed LUL
[1:30:47] <%kyh9> GOD
[1:30:49] <%arkv01> the LBs are cool but very niche use
[1:30:50] <@Commando_Joe> the limit break system was a big improvement
[1:30:51] <%kyh9> THE SPRITE WORK IN THIS GAME IS SO GOOD
[1:30:52] <otakon17> or not
[1:30:56] <+samuraicaveman> most people go through this game without ever seeing a limit break
[1:31:00] <%kyh9> Am I really going to replay 6 AGAIN
[1:31:02] <%kyh9> yes
[1:31:02] <toulon_somberjade> It triggers at random in critical health each time you attack
[1:31:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:31:04] <otakon17> yeah maybe NOT put Terra in front
[1:31:06] <+RealThiele> yea im glad they just let the artists make better sprites
[1:31:07] <%townzzzzz> yes
[1:31:07] <%xerotwo> FIGARO FIGARO FIGAROOOOOOO
[1:31:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DA FUZZ
[1:31:11] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:31:11] <%TheHateFish> There's a reason 7's LB system is the one used in all subsequent games
[1:31:14] <velgaduere> RABBLE RABBLE
[1:31:18] <okamiizero> @G_Thunders It's basically the "Magic Crystal Stuff" is happening, there's less of that in 7 and 10, but I think Prelude is in every game at some point or another
[1:31:19] <morkelebmink> THIS is my favorite FF game out of all of them
[1:31:20] <nyacoo> @G_Thunders In FF7 it's used only for the credit scroll at the end I think
[1:31:21] <%arkv01> agaghhrahgag LETS JET
[1:31:22] <otakon17> and now...the world map theme

[1:34:54] <+Ngp3_> @majindusto Character designer for Setzer and Shadow too
[1:34:56] <Jaxnos> the osmosis for FF6 music will probably be the hardest of the deja vu moments. guarantee you've heard music in a bunch of unexpected places
[1:34:57] <otakon17> I mean for NOW it's rare
[1:34:57] <AbnormalVoid> @majindusto he also designed the chibi versions of the characters, iirc
[1:34:58] <CruxAustralis> eh you can buy the items
[1:35:02] <+SolGainer> Nah you'll be fine
[1:35:02] <+HavenlessWF> a TON of music from this game is super memorable

[1:35:06] <+pectusumbra> I mean AoE fire is 4 mp
[1:35:07] <+RealThiele> coxJam
[1:35:09] <%Namillus> Ethers are rare early on and expensive later
[1:35:10] <otakon17> don't worry, Ethers get more common later on and your MP pool gets way bigger
[1:35:12] <BlackermanZX> dont worry bout it too much
[1:35:13] <$MonsterEnvy> Ethers and Recovery heal mp

[1:35:28] <+Byr0nX> is he playing snes, gba, pc etc?
[1:35:29] <CruxAustralis> and you get a lot of MP later

[1:46:56] <+LastHazzerd> like Luke
[1:47:00] <%DreyfussFrost> @ozzrabbit Yeah but the problem is, most of the MSQ is still walking/teleporting and talking, and ARR isn't particularly great at either.
[1:47:09] <+solzan2000> i just just the elden ring score..holy shit
[1:47:14] <+solzan2000> saw*
[1:47:22] <%DreyfussFrost> @Catpurnicus You're looking at it.

[1:47:27] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> there's already a mod for the game?
[1:47:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ozzrabbit trueee, the first half of ARR is a bit of a slog

[1:47:59] <%townzzzzz> ooooo
[1:47:59] <+anoldtoilet> the japanese names of final fantasy things are cool because we had like two parallel standards of what the names were for a while, and now eventually everything became standardized to the western canon names

[2:18:31] <+Dakuu75> (that water shouldn't look that good)
[2:18:33] <TimeWanderer> That's some HD-2D looking water.
[2:18:34] <%kyh9> Like, when I think about ME2, I think about how it lifts FF6's structure almost exactly
[2:18:37] <@Menitta> my favorite line from a GITCY review is "Breath of Fire 3. Better than FF7, but not as good as Wild Arms"
[2:18:37] <+SolidusRex> Kreygasm The cave music
[2:18:37] <+Catpurnicus> this is like the most common area song by a huge margin
[2:18:40] <jorniev> yeyeyeye

[2:18:52] <+Ether101_Prime> @emptyantics That tactics game was the last nail in the coffin.
[2:18:53] <alrobot2014> @kyh9 that explains part of why i love me2
[2:18:55] <crimsonharvest> im glad they were able to do such a good new arrangement
[2:18:55] <emptyantics> Play Wild Arms chat
[2:18:57] <KobeTeeth90> gross
[2:19:01] <Teradyne87> When you have a thief, always be stealing
[2:19:06] <lotharrio> @emptyantics I already did.
[2:19:09] <arkvc> wow wild arms is that good huh?
[2:19:12] <+InspectEIement> remmeber tools are free
[2:19:12] <raye0gin> never stop auto crossbowing
[2:19:15] <+DevinMayCry> "Treasure Hunter"
[2:19:16] <%Namillus> At this stage Edgar is a delete button
[2:19:18] <PenGia> no reason not to crossbow
[2:19:23] <turdsman> tools are free btw
[2:19:23] <+Nekros4442> theres no reason not to use tools woolie
[2:19:26] <PainterOfMiniatures> always crossbow
[2:19:29] <emptyantics> @arkvc Some of the best JRPG‚Äôs ever
[2:19:29] <$MonsterEnvy> Crossbow
[2:19:30] <%DreyfussFrost> @Spinningrobo Edgar's title was „Éû„Ç∑„Éº„Éä„É™„Éº (Mashƒ´narƒ´ as in Machinery)
[2:19:31] <badugidugi> autocrossbow always best choice ;p
[2:19:32] <lotharrio> He's trying to Steal first.
[2:19:34] <shiny_prinny> he's trying for steals, chat
[2:19:36] <%TheBesteban> I'm not seeing enough arrows
[2:19:37] <alrobot2014> i think he's going for the steal
[2:19:37] <+Byr0nX> remember tool
[2:19:39] <iacus_> there is no downside to crosswob
[2:19:40] <+SolGainer> cool it with the backseating chat LUL
[2:19:44] <hentaimaxer> wild arms is good
[2:19:44] <+Spoonsire> Remember your ABCs: Always Be Crossbowin'
[2:19:45] <%xerotwo> LUL
[2:19:46] <Teradyne87> You're doing less damage from the back row
[2:19:53] <+DevinMayCry> Is this woolies first time playing 6?
[2:19:53] <+Delthanin> auto-crossbow = free damage
[2:19:54] <+retro_godfather> nice attack effects
[2:19:55] <%xerotwo> C R I T
[2:19:57] <+Ether101_Prime> Does he have the autocrossbow?
[2:19:57] <+Jiggisnipe> that fluid is very fluid looking
[2:20:03] <+healnavi> yes
[2:20:04] <+terry_quest> yes
[2:20:04] <+Catpurnicus> lol locke can't get a kill on a crit even
[2:20:05] <haisho> yeah
[2:20:06] <shiny_prinny> yeah
[2:20:06] <Teradyne87> Yes
[2:20:06] <PenGia> yes
[2:20:07] <%DreyfussFrost> Yes, but it's fine
[2:20:08] <@Menitta> yes this is Woolie's first time playing FF6
[2:20:08] <+Dakuu75> is this woolie's first play of this? (like, zero spoilers, kind of thing)?
[2:20:09] <+Grayhammatter> kinda
[2:20:09] <stuffamiriteyea> yes
[2:20:10] <brunoberserk> yes
[2:20:12] <$MonsterEnvy> Yes
[2:20:14] <+DevinMayCry> Nice woolie
[2:20:15] <morkelebmink> sell the extra one
[2:20:16] <DedlokPM> @dakuu75 that was the earlier games but it seems it was the vocal minority with some rose tinted glasses action going on. also those were smaller sprites. Main issue people have now is the fonts but that is easily fixed with mods and/or file changing
[2:20:17] <+InspectEIement> bioblaster is sick
[2:20:20] <jaysondeez> you can sell the extra
[2:20:20] <kinkade_77> Yea worthless
[2:20:21] <+Nobrev> quick tip: when it says "couldn't steal" the steal failed but when there's nothing to steal you'll get a different message iirc
[2:20:21] <+treblesom> only need one tool
[2:20:22] <dontfeedthechocobo> i too have the impulse to tell chat to chill, but chat will not chill LUL
[2:20:22] <+Dakuu75> oh jesus. ok lol
[2:20:24] <stuffamiriteyea> sell the extra
[2:20:25] <%Namillus> Very experimental kind of mechanic, just sell it back it's fine
[2:20:26] <%Shad0wTag> HEY PAIZANOS
[2:20:26] <+GalacticaPhanto> Edgar building up his meter using his rotation, he's gonna crossbow mobs in his burst phase
[2:20:27] <BoneofMalkav> Terra Learned PAIZANO LUL
[2:20:27] <%DreyfussFrost> You got a free one as soon as he first became controllable.
[2:20:29] <%Mr_Pylon> When I was a kid I thought getting more of them would power it up
[2:20:32] <+Grayhammatter> paizano?
[2:20:33] <crascabaras> might wanna change formation to be on the vanguard.
[2:20:34] <+SolidusRex> PERSONA
[2:20:44] <+SolGainer> jebaited
[2:20:47] <subjectg> Terra can now do the Mario
[2:20:47] <+SolGainer> Jebaited
[2:20:47] <morkelebmink> might want to change formation and put terra in the back
[2:20:52] <turdsman> having the number next to it in the menu is a little more confusing
[2:20:55] <jorniev> i think it did
[2:21:04] <kinkade_77> This music oml
[2:21:08] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> he always starts with crossbow
[2:21:09] <jorniev> PPOISONA?
[2:21:13] <TioXyco> the original gave you onw autocross bow when you get edgar into the party
[2:21:15] <jorniev> POISONA 3
[2:21:16] <emptyantics> Terra learned how to hit the naynay
[2:21:18] <Teradyne87> Don't forget the healing spring in the beginning of this cave
[2:21:25] <+Dakuu75> @DedlokPM doodShake
[2:21:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:21:29] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I cant remember, its been so long since I haven't bought all 3 tool to start
[2:21:30] <yukichocomilk> each time woolie saves i'll start thinking i'm getting a tell in ffxiv
[2:21:32] <+DevinMayCry> Oh im glad they didnt remove the "jobs" from the western version this time
[2:21:33] <PainterOfMiniatures> bad chest
[2:21:37] <hentaimaxer> "couldn't steal" = dice roll fail "nothing to steal" = no item
[2:21:37] <PainterOfMiniatures> don't open
[2:21:39] <+dougtert> honestly just put everyone in back until it feels like you need to change things up
[2:21:56] <robobeau> That time chest thing is so wild
[2:21:59] <crimsonharvest> that one's worth waiting for nice catch reggie
[2:22:00] <+Catpurnicus> thats a nice indicator on the chest
[2:22:01] <robobeau> Never knew that when playing the originalk
[2:22:04] <rinaldiaar> god banging track
[2:22:07] <+Dakuu75> wait wut I was reading chat. what about the chest?
[2:22:14] <+SolGainer> yes there is
[2:22:15] <majindusto> FOPER
[2:22:17] <turdsman> oh cool Reggie is on top of the stupid shit LUL
[2:22:17] <+DevinMayCry> I hate timed chests lol
[2:22:20] <%RaziWraith> hold up. Time chests is a thing in FFVI?
[2:22:22] <+Jiggisnipe> cuz timey wimey
[2:22:27] <+Worsel5> Holy crap I didn't know that and been playing this since release...
[2:22:29] <T_Sasquatch> Wtf is a timed chest
[2:22:33] <+Mendin> Chrono Trigger's ones are much  more explicit at least
[2:22:34] <+Dakuu75> oh, like... later in the game? dude.
[2:22:34] <+Delthanin> ...I never realized that with CT
[2:22:35] <+terry_quest> timed chest is one of the worst concepts
[2:22:38] <%DreyfussFrost> The sealed chests. If you interact with them in 600 AD first, then open in 1000 AD before you open in 600 AD, they improve.
[2:22:40] <T_Sasquatch> Oh that's bullshit
[2:22:42] <@Menitta> It's kinda cool but annoying when you find them in the early game
[2:22:42] <rinaldiaar> Final Fantasy be like "Hey this enemy is dealing out quadruple digit damage and giving you brain damage, but take this banging OST as consolation"
[2:22:44] <+terry_quest> made me restart ff12
[2:22:45] <+Catpurnicus> I think ff6 might have started time chests
[2:22:46] <kinkade_77> Do things get rebalanced in this?
[2:22:46] <alrobot2014> chest that gets different loot when you open them at different points in the game
[2:22:48] <yeildingthought> In trigger? Wild
[2:22:48] <lotharrio> In CT, the mechanic is, interact with it in the past with your magic necklace, go to the future to pick it up, then go back to the past to pick up the early item, too.
[2:22:49] <+DevinMayCry> Funny how could break FF12 with it though
[2:22:51] <okamiizero> In Chrono Trigger, after getting the better loot from the future, you can return to the past and get the less good items too for the rest of the party
[2:22:52] <%DreyfussFrost> But you have to interact with them first, or the 1000 AD chest has the basic loot.
[2:22:56] <enerkaizer> could be worse. remember the gimmick with chests in FF12? LUL
[2:23:03] <subjectg> Scalable loot is dumb, like how gear in some games can get better depending on when you do the quedy to get them
[2:23:06] <@SoushinSen> i never knew about timed chest, this is the first i heard of it. it sucks for someone like me who open all chests
[2:23:14] <+Grayhammatter> auto crossbow doing work
[2:23:15] <CruxAustralis> splitting magic is supe worth if it's an elemental weakness of the monsters @WoolieVersus
[2:23:16] <%Namillus> Edgar: "Oh there's a fight here? Anyway - "
[2:23:16] <TimeWanderer> @enerkaizer The actual worst ever.
[2:23:21] <+Dakuu75> never heard of that till now. pretty dope mechanic
[2:23:23] <turdsman> also in CT if you graba chest in a later time period and that map exists in another one you can get a second if you go back
[2:23:24] <emptyantics> @enerkaizer Holy shit I had completely forgotten how much bullshit those chests were NotLikeThis
[2:23:26] <%DreyfussFrost> @SoushinSen The rewards in 6 aren't that vital.
[2:23:26] <Teradyne87> L
[2:23:27] <GHouseduivel> vineKermiepls
[2:23:28] <Teradyne87> :2
[2:23:30] <alrobot2014> R2 i think
[2:23:31] <Teradyne87> L2
[2:23:31] <%Namillus> Triangle
[2:23:32] <+terry_quest> this game has only a few
[2:23:32] <%DreyfussFrost> L1/R1
[2:23:36] <%unboundsoul358> square?
[2:23:37] <yukichocomilk> what was the ff12 gimmick?
[2:23:53] <%unboundsoul358> different button on snes, oops
[2:23:59] <%arkv01> oh weird button to put the chara switch on, didn't it used to be square or triangle (equivalent on the snes controller)
[2:24:01] <TioXyco> @yukichocomilk FF12 felt like an MMO combat wise, but was single player
[2:24:02] <+SolGainer> Jebaited
[2:24:02] <+terry_quest> @yukichocomilk cant open certain chests or you miss out on the zodiac spear
[2:24:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> square is auto battle/macro
[2:24:06] <enerkaizer> @yukichocomilk In order to get the best weapon in the game you had to NOT OPEN 4 specific chests that aren't marked in any way
[2:24:07] <linSP> as a kid I never skipped turns
[2:24:12] <lotharrio> @SoushinSen I figured it out organically as a kid, because on my second playthrough I remembered most of the early items being trash, and didn't bother getting them early on.
[2:24:13] <+DevinMayCry> @yukichocomilk Basically chests had semi random items from a pool and the pool would change from gathering from some chests or even if chests can appear
[2:24:17] <hentaimaxer> yeah the game is too easy for missables to matter
[2:24:20] <TimeWanderer> @yukichocomilk There were like 4 random chests in the game where if you opened them at any point you'd get locked out of endgame rewards for no reason.
[2:24:20] <+Dakuu75> omg, the font is so much higher rez than the portraits lmao
[2:24:29] <+healnavi> 12 also had invisible chests
[2:24:30] <Warbot40> I like how the pixel remaster looks in FFV but it's just kinda off here.
[2:24:31] <Tha_DiLA> only the original PS2 version of XII
[2:24:34] <+Catpurnicus> yeah the font is still off
[2:24:35] <turdsman> oh damn you can move diagonally?
[2:24:36] <yukichocomilk> that's awful lmao
[2:24:38] <+Mendin> UROK-HAI
[2:24:44] <shiny_prinny> I love angy Terra so much
[2:24:44] <Teradyne87> Edgar: "Hey Terra, does this smell like ether to you?"
[2:24:49] <%Giothegame> The arranged music sounds great
[2:24:49] <lotharrio> Edgar, aka, early game carry.
[2:24:52] <%arkv01> @Teradyne87 LUL
[2:24:52] <+Jiggisnipe> wow FF12 chests sound dumb as fuck
[2:24:53] <jetblackjay2> let's fucking go FF3 üòâ
[2:24:55] <+DevinMayCry> "end game" mind you isnt actual endgame. You can abuse the chest stuff to get an OP invisible weapons too early game in 12
[2:24:57] <+Ngp3_> @yukichocomilk Also, you only controlled one character, but IIRC you could give the other party members commands
[2:25:03] <alrobot2014> the game will say "nothing to steal" if there is nothing
[2:25:04] <+Dakuu75> I don't mind the font. I feel like they could up rez the portraits and it'd look nice, imo
[2:25:08] <+DevinMayCry> Zodiac Spear was the infamous deal though yeah
[2:25:11] <KobeTeeth90> @jetblackjay2 around here we say 6
[2:25:14] <+crybirb> the concept of invisible chests makes no sense at all
[2:25:18] <enerkaizer> There are multiple reasons why I think FF12 was one of the worst rpg's ever made
[2:25:24] <+DevinMayCry> Youd be wrong
[2:25:25] <emptyantics> I love the hunting monsters mechanic in FFXII
[2:25:34] <jetblackjay2> @kobeteeth90 were American we got 6 as 3 baby
[2:25:37] <$MonsterEnvy> Depends on the tools
[2:25:38] <+anoldtoilet> i like a lot of parts of ff12 but not all of it
[2:25:39] <%DreyfussFrost> Bio Blaster is poison
[2:25:42] <Teradyne87> Bioblaster does poison damage
[2:25:42] <+dougtert> depends on the tool
[2:25:42] <%DreyfussFrost> I think?
[2:25:44] <+Nekros4442> they're weak t9 the power of gun woolie
[2:25:44] <+Stormzcales_Lair> think Bio
[2:25:46] <+Nemmers922> FFXII was a fantastic game, just a terrible Final Fantasy
[2:25:50] <+Dakuu75> fucking, zu-bat caves over here now
[2:25:51] <+solzan2000> FF12 was supposed to be an mmo
[2:25:51] <+healnavi> flamethrower is fire, shit like that
[2:25:52] <KobeTeeth90> @jetblackjay2 no but u know better now
[2:25:57] <+solzan2000> FF12 <3
[2:25:58] <linSP> bioblast you mean fart
[2:25:58] <+DevinMayCry> Yeah I think 12 is pretty controversial sometimes
[2:25:58] <%SlimmieP> Love seeing Reggie be the guide
[2:25:59] <%arkv01> let's not do the ff12 wars now, its one of the most divisive ffs
[2:26:00] <+dougtert> if a tool doesn't seem like it would be elemental then its not
[2:26:00] <turdsman> I think there are a couple that count as magic
[2:26:01] <Teradyne87> Noiseblaster is a ghettoblaster
[2:26:03] <Ipsenscastle> At least we can all agree Vaan and his gross insect abs are the worst
[2:26:07] <+crybirb> @solzan2000 I can feel that in its battle systems
[2:26:08] <+Catpurnicus> never stop autocrossbowing everything in sight
[2:26:12] <+HereComestheChief> woolieGASM
[2:26:12] <%DreyfussFrost> Nope, you're good
[2:26:14] <+solzan2000> yup
[2:26:15] <+healnavi> nah
[2:26:17] <emptyantics> I like 12 but the story was meh
[2:26:18] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[2:26:18] <jorniev> I forget what was the deal with this being final fantasy 6... but like 3?
[2:26:18] <crimsonharvest> no turt is later
[2:26:19] <Teradyne87> Can't go in turtle door
[2:26:20] <TimeWanderer> THE THEME IS FINALLY HERE
[2:26:21] <badugidugi> nah ur good
[2:26:22] <%xjn_> lobosJAM
[2:26:23] <+Catpurnicus> its weird being able to see the map properly
[2:26:24] <+solzan2000> was a test run for FF14
[2:26:30] <+DevinMayCry> @jorniev It was the 3rd final fantasy released in west
[2:26:30] <+Dakuu75> @Ipsenscastle I felt like Baan was the best part of that game.
[2:26:31] <+crybirb> @Ipsenscastle I dunno man there's some Tidus apologists in here
[2:26:32] <+Nobrev> woopsPls
[2:26:36] <%arkv01> jesus christ what is this thing ScaredyCat
[2:26:37] <+Ngp3_> At least we can agree that FF9 is best FF game
[2:26:37] <+Mendin> Bafmodar?
[2:26:48] <%unboundsoul358> that save sfx went off and I thought I got a /tell in FF14 OmegaLul
[2:26:51] <+Grayhammatter> bafmodad
[2:26:55] <+Dakuu75> wtf is that name. Rita Repulsa sending her monsters out here??? "Make my monster grow!" shit?
[2:26:57] <Teradyne87> That damn statue god from Conan the Destroyer
[2:26:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FFBE FIRST BOSS
[2:27:00] <+Mendin> Romanticore?
[2:27:00] <+DevinMayCry> We skipped 2, 3, and 5 in west so 4 and 6 were 2 and 3. 7 if it was released like older games would have been called Final Fantasy 4
[2:27:00] <Ne0classical> That sound it too close to ff 14 message sound
[2:27:09] <+omnipotentcreature> @Ngp3_ least favorite ff
[2:27:12] <MagicMoste> that things got almost as wide of a torso as ryu
[2:27:15] <available_line> @BallerSwagBro9k For real. It's been a while.
[2:27:19] <jorniev> i got stuck in this game, in the octopus dude
[2:27:22] <+DevinMayCry> Is this version retranslated BTW?
[2:27:33] <lotharrio> Sleeping Bag is full, though.
[2:27:38] <+healnavi> @devinmaycry no
[2:27:38] <+SolGainer> @DevinMayCry yeah

[2:27:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats a big ass cabbage
[2:27:50] <jorniev> yo this music slaps
[2:27:51] <%DreyfussFrost> @DevinMayCry It uses the GBA translation unfortunately, but it can be modded with whatever you want eventually.
[2:27:52] <+DevinMayCry> Which of you brothers are lying
[2:27:53] <%arkv01> welcome to Canada sugoiSchleep
[2:27:54] <T_Sasquatch> Ff14 really is a reference to everything ff. Kind of insane how easy that is to miss

[2:37:31] <Slattsquatch> @hentaimaxer Nice, so it's basically the objectively best way to play this game then. Unless you REALLY like the Woolsey script.
[2:37:34] <jorniev> the dog doesnt bark ONLY BITES
[2:37:34] <%Th3rd3> Dog is like "Wait, I do?"
[2:37:36] <%townzzzzz> dog is getting his drink

[2:37:37] <lotharrio> Putting his dog on the stool, too.
[2:37:38] <%DreyfussFrost> @0ni0n_L0rd Because Square-Enix has an inferiority complex about their predecessors.

[2:38:59] <%DreyfussFrost> @0ni0n_L0rd Notice how they never make these kind of changes when they port 7 onward, but they won't release the original versions of 1-6 themselves? You can only get the originals on Nintendo systems.

[2:39:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> *climbs into bed* "So, you hear about Ukraine?"
[2:39:09] <SomeBlackGui> what version is this?
[2:39:12] <%xjn_> Speed stack??
[2:39:13] <%arkv01> just field speed
[2:39:16] <KobeTeeth90> I thought sprint were automatic in this y still in game
[2:39:16] <PainterOfMiniatures> walking and running
[2:39:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> nope. field speed
[2:39:18] <Teradyne87> It's not battle speed
[2:39:19] <haisho> doesn't affect battle at all IIRC
[2:39:23] <+pectusumbra> I'd get 1 for when you want it
[2:39:24] <CruxAustralis> @SomeBlackGui Pixel Remaster
[2:39:25] <%unboundsoul358> It DOUBLES it again!
[2:39:25] <hentaimaxer> I like the remixed music
[2:39:25] <%DreyfussFrost> No effect in battle. In the remake, sprint shoes double both walk AND run speed.
[2:39:25] <Scorchfield> in battle speed is a different relic
[2:39:27] <%Sunriser41> got go fast
[2:39:29] <+Grayhammatter> field speed i guess?
[2:39:30] <+SolGainer> Sprint shoes are not worth it
[2:39:31] <%RaziWraith> nah man we need that ludicrous speed!
[2:39:34] <%oneimportantthing> @reallybigrocks "These sheets are so soft. Anyway, heard about Donbass lately?"
[2:39:36] <%unboundsoul358> it's a boost to make base x2 and run x4
[2:39:38] <+anoldtoilet> @0ni0n_L0rd they should, the ff7 translation is awful
[2:39:40] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @someblackgui The Pixel Remaster, literally out today
[2:39:48] <CruxAustralis> that's a good one
[2:39:50] <KobeTeeth90> x4 Run PogChemp
[2:39:52] <+DevinMayCry> I like these for speccing into jobs like granting cover
[2:39:52] <%arkv01> the "I will die for you" ring
[2:39:53] <BoneofMalkav> Sprint button from what I've seen with the previous Pixel Remasters is fine, but add sprint shoes and it's "Jesus Take The Wheel" speed
[2:39:55] <+anoldtoilet> the fan translation "beacause" is a legit godsend for people who actually want to understand what that games story is
[2:39:58] <+DevinMayCry> Equip
[2:39:58] <+pectusumbra> it's a passive
[2:40:00] <shiny_prinny> auto
[2:40:01] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> auto
[2:40:04] <KobeTeeth90> auto passive
[2:40:04] <+DevinMayCry> Its an auto yes
[2:40:05] <badugidugi> auto
[2:40:10] <Scorchfield> auto when other person is low
[2:40:16] <Teradyne87> Knight class ability as an equipable item
[2:40:21] <crimsonharvest> if i was giving advice i'd say star pendants
[2:40:23] <%arkv01> nice of them to keep it in anways
[2:40:26] <+DevinMayCry> Love how FF9 zidane only learns to cover girl party members

[2:40:49] <+LastHazzerd> Poison Jam
[2:40:50] <CruxAustralis> eh you have Poisma
[2:40:59] <Teradyne87> Blind will annoy you more
[2:41:15] <%DreyfussFrost> In the original game, holding B/Circle to run was enabled by the Sprint Shoes. In the remake, running is free and Sprint Shoes double the speed of both, so you run/sprint.
[2:41:23] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Auto-Crossbow is great
[2:41:32] <%Namillus> Also items are instant
[2:41:39] <+DevinMayCry> Yeah I thought woolie was wearing them already when he ran earlier
[2:42:12] <hentaimaxer> There is a character that throws weapon at enemies for damage so you can keep weapons for later
[2:42:25] <alrobot2014> you go lightspeed with sprintshoes now
[2:42:29] <FrostedZaibatsu> TOP SPEED
[2:42:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:42:29] <%arkv01> oh thats the old speed LUL
[2:42:36] <+Grayhammatter> cya later fucker LUL
[2:42:38] <%DreyfussFrost> Sprint shoes are there because they effect doubles the speed of both.  Running with them on is 4x speed.
[2:43:04] <alrobot2014> I didn't read that initial tutorial
[2:43:06] <%tyler274> you will learn child, kupo
[2:43:09] <+DevinMayCry> All it takes to become a dragoon in this game is boots lol
[2:43:09] <%unboundsoul358> sprint shoes make you go double speed for both normal *and* run button speed.
[2:43:13] <%holydeviant1> RTFM, KUPO
[2:43:14] <+xenoboost> are you stupid kupo
[2:43:15] <+Byr0nX> are you even ready this kupo

[2:43:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> Smoke weed everyday, kupo
[2:43:34] <%DreyfussFrost> Your running speed NOW is Sprint Shoe speed in the original
[2:43:35] <Dannzzyy> Yoo this finally came out! Where the switch version at square?
[2:43:36] <badugidugi> exactly right
[2:43:40] <stuffamiriteyea> if it's like thief in ffv it's super fast but hard to steer

[2:43:59] <Teradyne87> Oh no
[2:44:05] <%DreyfussFrost> Yes
[2:44:06] <+pectusumbra> and worth just keeping in your pocket for later
[2:44:13] <crimsonharvest> sprint started in FF5, where it was a feature of having a Thief in the party at all
[2:44:13] <%DreyfussFrost> Now walking speed is your old run speed.
[2:44:14] <+xenoboost> its overture blast mode dashing
[2:44:14] <PainterOfMiniatures> grinding
[2:44:18] <%tyler274> nananana, its the mother fucking M O DOUBLE G
[2:44:19] <+undersea_magic> it's only 1500 rupees
[2:44:22] <+pectusumbra> there will come SOME POINT where you will want to just hoof it
[2:44:24] <lotharrio> Still cut down on overall time.
[2:44:26] <PainterOfMiniatures> per step and you get more steps
[2:44:33] <Scorchfield> its nice for speed runners and impatient people
[2:44:34] <FrostedZaibatsu> Steps probably activate items too
[2:44:36] <+DevinMayCry> Nice having the walk as fast as old run too
[2:44:36] <%DreyfussFrost> Yes battles are by distance, not time
[2:44:38] <+rasend0ri> Yes it will affect battle
[2:44:42] <Teradyne87> That speed kills the bitrate over long distances

[2:48:13] <haisho> it does look like a marlin
[2:48:17] <+Grayhammatter> ah yes, fish shop
[2:48:26] <+Mendin> Noiseblaster? You mean the BASS CANNON?
[2:48:29] <+SolidusRex> Blast your bio
[2:48:29] <crimsonharvest> we got fish in large and small, point and sharp
[2:48:30] <+pectusumbra> okay, so you can get them if you don't want to wait
[2:48:33] <lotharrio> Yeah but does Edgar really need to ever use a sword?
[2:48:34] <%DreyfussFrost> I think Edgar has to be the lead
[2:48:35] <hentaimaxer> no
[2:48:35] <haisho> nah same price
[2:48:37] <shiny_prinny> No
[2:48:37] <+pectusumbra> same price or you can wait to get them cheap
[2:48:38] <crimsonharvest> they're cheaper than in the 1.0
[2:48:38] <Teradyne87> No
[2:48:38] <+HereComestheChief> They're the same
[2:48:41] <Scorchfield> same
[2:48:41] <%unboundsoul358> same price
[2:48:42] <+pectusumbra> all good
[2:48:43] <%Sunriser41> just buy then, is not like gil matters that much
[2:48:47] <brunoberserk> same price
[2:48:47] <+DevinMayCry> Theyre so cheap anyway
[2:48:49] <CruxAustralis> Noiseblaster is not the best but Bioblaster is great
[2:48:49] <%arkv01> yeyeyeye spend that dollah
[2:48:51] <%unboundsoul358> Just spend, you can grind later
[2:48:54] <+DevinMayCry> You have a lot of gil
[2:48:56] <fantom_flasch> Bioblaster lol
[2:48:58] <+jortemur> Edgar has to be in front I thnk
[2:48:59] <+Delthanin> Tools!  I gotta have my Tools!  Zip ties, duct tape...
[2:49:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @fantom_flasch Goo Shooter
[2:49:19] <+dj_berserk_ix> Too heavy
[2:49:20] <+pectusumbra> just give locke the mythrial sword edgar has
[2:49:22] <Teradyne87> Edgar has a mythril sword already
[2:49:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:49:30] <+pectusumbra> ayyyy good man
[2:49:30] <brunoberserk> money is not a problem in this game like FF1 , right ?
[2:49:32] <%ozzrabbit> ‚Ä¶it just occurred to me‚Ä¶ why does Edgar remind me of a competent Emanelaine De Fortomps?
[2:49:35] <Teradyne87> Good catch
[2:49:40] <%DreyfussFrost> Did the prices get reduced? Might be the mandela effect but I remember the cost of tools being in the thousands.
[2:49:44] <OblivionSword1> nice
[2:49:44] <%arkv01> I have never run into money problems in ff6
[2:49:45] <lotharrio> @brunoberserk Not really. maybe early on, or at the end game.
[2:49:51] <+Mendin> I like how Magic Elf Silver is typically a like second-third city upgrade and not like endgame stuff
[2:50:22] <+pectusumbra> bio blaster is real good
[2:50:38] <+DrZomboo> bio blaster is worth it
[2:50:41] <%arkv01> yeah the fart blaster was is potent
[2:50:45] <majindusto> KENPO GI
[2:50:58] <hentaimaxer> there is no reason to not get one tool of every kind
[2:50:59] <speximillian> I wonder if evasion works right here?
[2:51:02] <linSP> all kenpo gi
[2:51:08] <+pectusumbra> correct
[2:51:09] <%DreyfussFrost> Yes
[2:51:11] <alrobot2014> @speximillian it sure does work
[2:51:30] <PainterOfMiniatures> unless you use the gauntlet
[2:51:35] <+DevinMayCry> Thats one of the nicer things about these is fixing old bugs
[2:51:48] <+pectusumbra> Edgar wears heavy stuff I believe
[2:51:52] <+DevinMayCry> Cant be an old RPG if you dont have at least one skill or stat completly broken by a bug
[2:51:59] <crimsonharvest> savin frames here
[2:52:02] <%arkv01> its the staples easy button
[2:52:02] <linSP> I always ditch shields and go two hand for dps
[2:52:06] <iacus_> no thinking required
[2:52:10] <%DreyfussFrost> To be fair, the optimize button isn't new. OG had it.
[2:52:21] <hentaimaxer> @devinmaycry yes but no, the instakills in this game were nutty
[2:52:31] <+pectusumbra> the stuff you want to save you'll generally know
[2:52:48] <brunoberserk> you know , for a dude that is supposed to be a king , edgar have a really shit armor and sword LUL
[2:52:58] <+DevinMayCry> ITS MYTHRIL
[2:52:59] <Teradyne87> Old disused equipment does gain use later with a character ability

[2:57:30] <GHouseduivel> üî• üî• B) üî• üî•
[2:57:34] <+pectusumbra> because evasion didn't worth
[2:57:36] <+pectusumbra> *work
[2:57:39] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus You never went down those stairs
[2:57:40] <SilverFaustX> KKona GuitarTime

[2:57:47] <%xjn_> lobosRage
[2:57:47] <%Xx_HD_xX> Xx_HD_xX subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:57:49] <shiny_prinny> Shadow just buying up the bar
[2:57:54] <%Namillus> Reggie means back in the old days suffering with Blind doubled the enemy's Evasion but the Evasion stat did nothing
[2:58:00] <Estwilde> love this tune
[2:58:03] <%Demoli_PT> has woolie had the shadow intro yet?
[2:58:14] <+DevinMayCry> I wasnt gonna buy KoF XV so soon but watched woolies vs vid on it today pushed me over as I was preordering Elden Ring
[2:58:16] <Ne0classical> Yeah
[2:58:19] <%robosqueeb> nice cup of cocoa, I've got a cup of cider here. that's good cider.
[2:58:30] <RetroCop87> is there a movement option between "normal" and "x100"? Woolie keeps missing the target in his pathing
[2:58:32] <%DreyfussFrost> So the bug was never that evasion was "broken," it was that the attack functions for physical attacks also pointed to magic evade. So because all attacks acted like magic, darkness/blind had no effect.
[2:58:32] <%xjn_> Terra get a job!
[2:58:36] <%badguy8312> I wonder if my PC can even handle elden ring
[2:58:56] <wotebi> does reggie needs to sit there he is getting blasted
[2:59:03] <+Mendin> That kid just wanted to play the bartop arcade machine
[2:59:07] <%arkv01> damn this is why people buy yeezies
[2:59:07] <+sherndon226> That whistle makes me think of Revengence
[2:59:17] <crimsonharvest> yeah i wonder actually, cause 5 had a feature for secret paths, and so did the easy versions of 4, but that was before 'minimap overlay' was invented
[2:59:19] <%badguy8312> it'd be my first soulsborne game in my own hands

[3:05:38] <+BignanasTheGawd> is woolie doing a play-through of ER tmr?
[3:05:42] <%thesickestzak> Timed chest are the dumbest
[3:05:43] <ErikFeral> What worst, PanicRoom or SafeSpace? Cause a SafeSpace creates learned helplessness and coud lead to panic room
[3:05:49] <DSD24> Ah yes its my rumpus room
[3:06:07] <$MonsterEnvy> One more door
[3:06:15] <majindusto> Basement  Robbed

[3:06:33] <ErikFeral> i dont even wanna talk about that, but i remember school being hell cause they gave me a "saferoom" and i was like no. I'd rather just walk out of the school
[3:06:34] <SilverFaustX> PepePls
[3:06:40] <crimsonharvest> oh shit nice find
[3:06:40] <%unboundsoul358> hyper wrist is LIT
[3:06:44] <%Xx_HD_xX> @Ardisan_ they look really nice imo
[3:06:47] <majindusto> Actual Dungeon
[3:06:47] <DSD24> Boost that shit
[3:06:55] <DSD24> Now this looks like a dungeon
[3:06:57] <+Kainin01> I'm surprised they didn't update the character profiles
[3:07:02] <%DreyfussFrost> OP
[3:07:02] <+capybruhArt> even FASTER RUN
[3:07:06] <%townzzzzz> JUMP THE CHASME
[3:07:07] <lotharrio> Good on Edgar.
[3:07:08] <CruxAustralis> Haste is sogood
[3:07:09] <shiny_prinny> that's BIG
[3:07:10] <+Kainin01> Also, Hi @WoolieVersus! Miss you <3
[3:07:11] <ErikFeral> Dungeons are just complex panic rooms if you think about it
[3:07:13] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> that HUGE
[3:07:15] <crimsonharvest> oh shit permanent haste sounds huge
[3:07:16] <Ardisan_> Seems like a cool way to replay something you played before
[3:07:18] <%badguy8312> break the sound barrier before you break a sweat
[3:07:18] <+RealThiele> auto x-bow haste Kreygasm
[3:07:27] <hentaimaxer> terra on front row triggers me lol
[3:07:27] <DSD24> Now Terra's original name was Tina right?
[3:07:41] <+Kainin01> @DSD24 In Japan, yes
[3:07:54] <TioXyco> The japanese name, yes. Tina Branford.
[3:07:54] <ErikFeral> the name tina has been ruined for me due to borderlands 2
[3:07:57] <%Xx_HD_xX> Why the name change?
[3:08:00] <DSD24> To be honest I get why they changed her name, but Tina's a cute name
[3:08:02] <Ardisan_> Tina sounds lame
[3:08:02] <%CaptainBeird> he's the armor itself
[3:08:03] <Iza_kku> they locked you in
[3:08:05] <%badguy8312> Terra Tina? Tarantino? coincidence? most likely
[3:08:06] <+pectusumbra> DAMN I don't remember any of this
[3:08:06] <%xjn_> general lee
[3:08:10] <DSD24> Then again I think of Tina from DOA
[3:08:11] <TioXyco> NA Localization wanted someting more "Exotic"
[3:08:12] <%tyler274> Why did they change Aerisu  to Aerith, who tf knows
[3:08:15] <+Grayhammatter> General Lee
[3:08:15] <lotharrio> Man kids are the best liars.
[3:08:19] <$MonsterEnvy> My Dad is a huge traitor
[3:08:21] <+Mendin> *car honking melody*
[3:08:21] <hentaimaxer> they still do call her Tina in Asia
[3:08:24] <+0ni0n_L0rd> WOOLIE
[3:08:24] <Ardisan_> Aerith sounds better imo
[3:08:25] <+Jiggisnipe> @Xx_HD_xX Tina isn't an exotic name. It's normal
[3:08:26] <CruxAustralis> oh no that kid's a slaver
[3:08:28] <enerkaizer> ... The car...? LUL
[3:08:30] <%badguy8312> my exact thoughts
[3:08:36] <%robosqueeb> can anyone say they truly know the general?
[3:08:39] <Sora9567> "You can always trust an honest liar."
[3:08:42] <+vaporousTippler> I'm so glad the car is more well known than the general.
[3:08:42] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[3:08:44] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> General Lee Fishcake obviously
[3:08:44] <%DreyfussFrost> @Jiggisnipe Yeah, that's why it's not Tina in English
[3:08:50] <DSD24> Terra I think of Teen Titans
[3:08:58] <%Xx_HD_xX> @Jiggisnipe oh...well from an early 90s marketing perspective I suppose that makes sense

[3:19:24] <+McDumDum> when my mom rented games I was afraid of deleting save files because I didn't want to get rid of any progress made even if it wasn't me
[3:19:28] <%badguy8312> Reggie got it straight out the mud
[3:19:32] <haisho> oh now I remember I hated these things because they had resistance to Bioblaster
[3:19:34] <$SilverRoddo> I had to rent FF6 for 3 days, usually games were 1-day rentals, i had to speed run this.
[3:19:34] <+Shackle_Rustyford> when i was in elementary school i let a kid borrow my pokemon red and he promised he wouldnt save over my file. he did, and he named his character "master"
[3:19:43] <tolloponik> is this the FF game where the dude flips the train?
[3:19:46] <%holydeviant1> @McDumDum Same, I'd just stare in awe at the massive top file
[3:19:49] <%arkv01> @Shackle_Rustyford power move
[3:19:58] <+McDumDum> I remember renting Mario 64 with a file without his hat and I thought that's how the game was
[3:19:59] <%DreyfussFrost> You know what else is a game changer? Having enough space on the UI to see HP and MP at the same time, and while healing.
[3:19:59] <SaltyAzteca> oops all Trilliums!!

[3:20:33] <%DreyfussFrost> Can you just equip the star pendant to cure poison?
[3:20:34] <+McDumDum> can you still edit the ui in the menus like the old game?
[3:20:34] <DSD24> Oh
[3:20:40] <lotharrio> @cobalt_phoenix_ increases ATB gain
[3:20:44] <+aBlueWizard> I got lucky and was able to bear chrono trigger in2 rentals,getting the same cartridge with my file untouched
[3:20:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lotharrio ah ok thanks

[3:31:14] <Teradyne87> Autosaves are new as well
[3:31:14] <+pectusumbra> You have to do raging fist. the fight doesn't end otherwise
[3:31:15] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie used raging fist too early Kappa
[3:31:15] <+Mendin> He did one but I guess he had to do it after the notification
[3:31:16] <+Saunt> didnt do the attack he told

[3:31:19] <NanTheDark> USE RAGING FIST
[3:31:20] <TioXyco> thing is... in this fight you only need the raging fist
[3:31:22] <%badguy8312> this is why we need blitz netcode
[3:31:23] <Sora9567> Which is weird because Woolie did do Raging Fist first.
[3:31:24] <%DreyfussFrost> It's not that, they want you to do Raging Fist to end the fight, but AFTER the tutorial.
[3:31:25] <stevenellis386> up up down down left right left right B A......
[3:31:25] <+Dakuu75> yes
[3:31:29] <%Demoli_PT> you could see them in the menu

[3:31:29] <+terry_quest> they tell you in the main menu
[3:31:30] <toulon_somberjade> You need to do Raging Fist
[3:31:31] <+vaporousTippler> Yeah, he rolled back right to a previous save.
[3:31:32] <boiadeiro_bob> you have to memorize them
[3:31:34] <+Dakuu75> it told you ONCE. the end.
[3:31:35] <OldManDeckardCain> you had to remember
[3:31:35] <dds333a> Woolz loses against Dyne confirmed
[3:31:35] <%xjn_> You had to look them up in the battle
[3:31:35] <ErikFeral> @AngryAsian5 It's offline, so no. it doesn't
[3:31:36] <%Proxzo> You could input unknown moves too
[3:31:38] <%DreyfussFrost> The inputs were in the main menu

[3:32:06] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> so what's the point of sprint shoes with a run button?
[3:32:07] <ThatLuluTho> 4 times the poison
[3:32:08] <$SilverRoddo> I think the booklet had the moves, i can‚Äôt recall

[3:32:14] <toulon_somberjade> And some of them have SNK levels of inputs
[3:32:15] <+AngelYoumou> Oh, I think that old Blitz could "Cheat" for stronger commands earlier, if you knew the input?
[3:32:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> miyazaki WISHES his poison was that strong
[3:32:18] <+Jiggisnipe> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends 4x speed lol
[3:32:20] <shiny_prinny> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends it's double the normal run speed
[3:32:20] <+Krivvan> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends it doubles it beyond the run speed this version adds
[3:32:22] <ErikFeral> it was already too late
[3:32:25] <segychan> hngggggg ffvi i'm so hard
[3:32:26] <%Proxzo> In the original you could input blitz that you learn later if you knew the commands
[3:32:27] <+RealThiele> !TOXIC!
[3:32:27] <lotharrio> Run back to the save and use a sleeping bag?
[3:32:32] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> so x4 speed? LUL
[3:32:39] <dds333a> get your Raging Storm ready LUL
[3:32:41] <shiny_prinny> Yeah it's nuts
[3:32:55] <hentaimaxer> @proxzo you can't do bumrush early
[3:32:56] <%badguy8312> pretzel motion to one shot everything in the early game?
[3:33:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Proxzo oh yeah, learning phantom rush was amazing
[3:33:17] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus You have to use the Blitz the tutorial told you to win, the others won't win the fight
[3:33:20] <%DreyfussFrost> In the original game, since you weren't given a chance to see Sabin's blitzes in his first fight, you were expected to fight normally.  Using Raging Fist (aka Pummel) would end the fight immediately but it was an easter egg.  This time it should do the same, but it looks like the trigger is only active after the tutorial.
[3:33:33] <+Dakuu75> I love that quality of life, fas-forward kind of stuff in RPGs. I don't have the patience to play these like I did when I was 8
[3:33:36] <NanTheDark> USE RAGING FIST
[3:33:45] <r0dneyjenkins> bruh
[3:33:54] <crimsonharvest> muscle wizard casts fist

[3:34:16] <PainterOfMiniatures> use raging fist!
[3:34:26] <%DreyfussFrost> @AngelYoumou I don't think so. You could use the Blitzes Sabin knows from the start in this fight, before getting a chance to see them. I don't think you could use unlearned Blitzes.
[3:34:33] <+terry_quest> dint sabin also have a healing blitz in this fight?
[3:34:33] <+ShinobiPhoenix> remember, he already did Raging Fist
[3:34:49] <+pectusumbra> Yes. 1 common 1 rare, but they have just 1 per fight
[3:34:53] <crimsonharvest> its typically a rare and a common steal
[3:34:56] <+Dakuu75> ussualy a common and rare
[3:34:57] <%Explodincatz> stealing is useless
[3:34:58] <+pectusumbra> and some are just empty
[3:34:58] <$Rafraud> Ye but you gotta wiki dive
[3:35:03] <NanTheDark> He didn't use it he started out using Aura Cannon
[3:35:08] <%xerotwo> ROUND 2
[3:35:09] <enerkaizer> this guys sprite always looks to me like a buff version of Obelix from asterix the Gaul LUL
[3:35:11] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:35:14] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Stealing is better when changed to MUG
[3:35:25] <speximillian> Can't you get a Mythril Claw from Vargas if you're lucky?
[3:35:27] <dan_g_v> wait FF6?! I thought ff1 was supposed to be the "final" one
[3:35:32] <NanTheDark> This time, you gotta use Raging Fist man
[3:35:41] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @nanthedark Woolie literally used Raging Fist first....
[3:35:42] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> some have two different drops, one common and one rare, it's best to look that stuff up later
[3:35:45] <$SilverRoddo> I believe some monstars would have a rare steal.
[3:36:01] <GHouseduivel> J A Z Z P I A N O üéπ
[3:36:12] <NanTheDark> @ShinobiPhoenix Are you sure? I feel like he didn't...
[3:36:13] <%badguy8312> @shinobiphoenix it only counts after the tutorial explains it
[3:36:14] <+RealThiele> yea either use a guide or mostly ignore steal and be happy with what you get
[3:36:26] <$SilverRoddo> Jim Carrey‚Äôs the Claw attack
[3:36:27] <+Felhad> He super did, Nan
[3:36:33] <%badguy8312> @nanthedark he did, before the tutorial dropped
[3:36:40] <%Sunriser41> will woolie read the tutorial this time?
[3:36:41] <NanTheDark> My mistake then
[3:36:41] <+pectusumbra> steal gets better once you get the relic that buffs it
[3:36:47] <Weltallgaia> I love those little half second violin interjections
[3:36:51] <NanTheDark> But yeah he has to do it after the tutorial then
[3:36:53] <+Mendin> Uematsu did some of his best work in this game, imo.
[3:36:58] <+pectusumbra> and to be fair this part got messed up. you have to do the move after the tutorial
[3:36:58] <speximillian> I wonder if Reggie knows how to get the Genji Glove instead of the Gauntlet coming up?
[3:36:59] <+ShinobiPhoenix> back in the day, you could use Aura Cannon instead of Raging
[3:37:10] <PainterOfMiniatures> raging fist!

[3:41:55] <@Solidus_113> does he have a raging demon
[3:41:59] <+Mendin> Wait until you see his Secret Ultimate Technique's move input
[3:42:00] <+pectusumbra> Magic for damage I mean
[3:42:02] <derap41> he's the piledriver of train's isn't he?
[3:42:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can you put on 2 haste relics for maximum punch?
[3:42:13] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus I would give him Locke's strength up Relic
[3:42:16] <NanTheDark> @crimsonharvest No, they can in a mod though, Brave New World, if I'm not mistaken
[3:42:16] <Teradyne87> Big Stronk

[3:42:26] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @solidus_113 Actually Yes

[3:42:30] <+Acecorleone> fucking love this game doodThirst
[3:42:33] <crimsonharvest> check them maybe they have secondary effects
[3:42:34] <%arkv01> uhh yeah don't think about it LUL
[3:42:35] <+pectusumbra> Aura Cannon is holy element for example
[3:42:36] <+WRATHZOG> Just gotta do the inputs correctly
[3:42:36] <+ShinobiPhoenix> different elements and statuses
[3:42:39] <lotharrio> Aura Cannon will o more.
[3:42:41] <hentaimaxer> some of them are AOE
[3:42:45] <$MonsterEnvy> Aura Cannon is Holy Damage
[3:42:45] <NanTheDark> Aura Cannon is Holy elemental
[3:42:45] <+RealThiele> haste on your bear
[3:42:47] <StrayDogsStrut> They each use different stats I think.
[3:42:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> AURA CANNON and HOLY
[3:42:48] <ireliaismaiwaifu> aura cannon is usually better
[3:42:48] <+Jiggisnipe> I think it tells you
[3:42:49] <%Demoli_PT> aura is holy
[3:42:52] <AbnormalVoid> aura canon is magic holy
[3:42:53] <%CollinsOfBodom> just suplex tf outta everything
[3:42:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Aura Cannon is HOLY
[3:42:55] <%unboundsoul358> Aura Cannon has magic bonus and holy property, raging fist cuts through defense
[3:42:56] <Scorchfield> some abilities have different damage types, i know that
[3:42:57] <+gelloattack513> catJam
[3:42:58] <%Sunriser41> some enemies are imune to suplex arent they? i dont remember
[3:42:58] <a_mad_dragon_> aura cannon all day every day
[3:43:00] <+Delthanin> Most are magic, some are physical.  Also, input commands more/less difficult for some people
[3:43:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Suplex the *eartH*
[3:43:03] <Teradyne87> Some hit multiple enemies, some have elemental damage
[3:43:03] <+Mendin> Suplex works best if it's a 1v1, if there's more enemies, you wanna punch
[3:43:05] <ReiDuran> With the fact that you always have the inputs there in front of you? Yeah there's no reason not to use the most damaging one
[3:43:08] <toulon_somberjade> They have different effects, Aura canon is Holy Element damage
[3:43:09] <lotharrio> Meteor only does big damage when there's a single target. Aura Cannon is consistent.
[3:43:10] <+JefDesenhero> not every enemy is suplexable"
[3:43:10] <agadejobi> Most of his blitz's are powered by his magic stat
[3:43:11] <ireliaismaiwaifu> meteor strike depends on how big the enemy is
[3:43:18] <lotharrio> Plus Meteor can miss.
[3:43:18] <toulon_somberjade> There are also support type ones
[3:43:22] <$SilverRoddo> ‚ÄúPummel‚Äù ignores defense
[3:43:24] <+Buckyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy> Full Party :D
[3:43:25] <%DreyfussFrost> Fist is physical, Aura is magic, Meteor deals proportionate damage. If I remember correctly, the more HP an enemy has the more damage Meteor Strike does. Or it depends on size.
[3:43:33] <DSD24> Unseelies look like dorks
[3:43:37] <+pectusumbra> god, just never stop covering Terra's theme
[3:43:51] <velgaduere> yeye
[3:43:59] <+CapnClassix> Suplex Kreygasm
[3:44:01] <speximillian> Meteor Strike is gravity-based, I thought
[3:44:07] <velgaduere> Meteor Strike is a duel move, basically
[3:44:12] <speximillian> So it'll do more damage if the enemy has more HP
[3:44:15] <kainhighwind1990> Just an fyi that Sabin's magic is higher than his physical
[3:44:16] <rasamune> haaa~ruuu~kaaa toooo~ookuuu

[3:45:00] <lotharrio> Raging is reliable damage. Aura is bigger damage that will rarely drop, often spike. Meteor is situational, can miss.

[3:53:04] <BepBepAmShep> Well that's something it never used to do
[3:53:05] <+pectusumbra> That was NEW
[3:53:06] <%DreyfussFrost> The path was always there, but the overlay is new
[3:53:06] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Oh hey they did the FFV thing
[3:53:07] <CruxAustralis> there wasn't
[3:53:07] <LoreKeeper_Thal> that's a WOL

[3:53:12] <KobeTeeth90> OMG WAT IS THAT WHITE PATH
[3:53:13] <%pi_in_the_sci> It didn't used to light up
[3:53:14] <CruxAustralis> yep you had to go through the dark
[3:53:15] <%Demoli_PT> yeah thats how it used to be
[3:53:15] <TioXyco> the path didn't light up on SNES, no
[3:53:15] <%DreyfussFrost> Yes, it was "fumble around in the dark"
[3:53:15] <+hatok> does Reggie know to get Woolie to Reject
[3:53:17] <hentaimaxer> Filthy casuuls WutFace WutFace
[3:53:20] <AthenaAegis> Wow, QoL improvement FOR DAYS in this remaster

[3:53:28] <%arkv01> a little bit babby mode, but thats 2020s LUL
[3:53:29] <brunoberserk> i hate when this happens with a character that betrays you, fucking jowy in suikoden 2 , GIVE BACK MY RUNES
[3:53:31] <Sora9567> Oh, is this port based on the SNES or the GBA with the bonus content?
[3:53:39] <lotharrio> RELIC
[3:53:41] <linSP> you still gotta find the hidden entryway
[3:53:41] <Blank9> snes
[3:53:43] <ReiDuran> I think White Cape is a relic
[3:53:45] <$MonsterEnvy> Check items
[3:53:46] <NanTheDark> The White Cape is a Relic, Woolie
[3:53:47] <+Grayhammatter> is it a relic?
[3:53:51] <StrayDogsStrut> Capes a relic
[3:53:54] <+Jiggisnipe> oh
[3:53:59] <+pectusumbra> relic, prevents mute and imp I believe?
[3:53:59] <+SargentToughie> @brunoberserk On the other hand, looting Gafgarion's inventory is my favorite part of FFT
[3:54:01] <%DreyfussFrost> Oh wow, the minimap shows that huh?
[3:54:03] <+ShinobiPhoenix> there's a Mini Map now?
[3:54:10] <TioXyco> @Sora9567 I'd say snes
[3:54:11] <linSP> the minimap is BIG cheats
[3:54:13] <+Jiggisnipe> top right lol
[3:54:14] <%DreyfussFrost> @ShinobiPhoenix It's behind the camera
[3:54:14] <%Giothegame> Doesn't the map just reveal where chests are?
[3:54:16] <$MonsterEnvy> Check items so you can learn what White Cap does
[3:54:19] <%arkv01> there was no minimap in the og, we're getting the genuine experience :)
[3:54:31] <%MichaelDood> Your beautiful faces are the only direction i need.
[3:54:39] <hentaimaxer> squeenix says baby games for baby audience
[3:54:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I understand that logically, I just mean Mini Map has never been in this game until now
[3:54:44] <waffleandman> i want the ff12 transparent map
[3:54:47] <Carlioo> @MichaelDood ok edgar
[3:54:48] <$SilverRoddo> No stream snipes with mini map
[3:54:54] <GHouseduivel> Its okay Haim Sabin.
[3:54:58] <%arkv01> himbo believes in EVERYONE
[3:55:11] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus You should check what White Cape does in items
[3:55:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> soon as Woolie said there's a Mini Map, I knew it had to be behind the camera logically, but I just couldn't believe they added one
[3:55:54] <Sora9567> "Decide for yourself. Just keep in mind we're totally boned if you leave us."
[3:56:07] <lotharrio> There's a lot of magic like stuff.
[3:56:10] <stuffamiriteyea> can't do magic but can shoot out a beam of light
[3:56:13] <+Mendin> "Ah I see you too know the Blazing Phoenix Wave"
[3:56:21] <+Akizea> Vargas out here doing EWGFs n shit
[3:56:22] <+WRATHZOG> Yeah it's just martial arts
[3:56:34] <+Mendin> "You have the power of the Orochi??"
[3:56:40] <%arkv01> just ki blasts
[3:56:41] <$MonsterEnvy> Vargas is also dead. Shocked he kind of just died
[3:56:43] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Only difference between Magic, Psionics, and Martial Arts is the source of the energy
[3:56:43] <Sora9567> Yeah, anyone can do a Power Geyser if they train hard enough.
[3:56:43] <DXLelouch24> a nukes a nuke

[4:01:35] <+Grayhammatter> WHOA
[4:01:38] <linSP> yep you just get a gauntlet if you say yes

[4:01:48] <SaltyAzteca> Yes Genji glove is OP
[4:01:49] <linSP> it‚Äôs OP AS SHIT MAN
[4:01:49] <+Grayhammatter> dual wielding
[4:01:49] <+AngelYoumou> @cobalt_phoenix_ A bribe, so to say, LUL
[4:01:53] <%DreyfussFrost> The Genji Glove is just straight up better.
[4:01:56] <lol_red_ranger> kingdom hearts parking lot dual wield gloves!
[4:02:00] <%CaptainBeird> take this to keep you safe by forsaking defense
[4:02:01] <speximillian> 2 hits vs one hit at 1.5x damage
[4:02:02] <majindusto> Oh god, Edgar  IS just proto-Thancred enigmaKEK
[4:02:03] <Sora9567> Good Route GO!
[4:02:07] <%DreyfussFrost> The damage formula on the Genji glove is WAY better than Gauntlet
[4:02:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Genji Glove allows you to be Bisexual
[4:02:11] <%DreyfussFrost> Gauntlet is 1.5x
[4:02:15] <+pectusumbra> NOTE: Genji Glove IS bugged. You do WORSE damage when you have 1 weapons, full damage with 2
[4:02:18] <+Grayhammatter> banon's character portrait... wtf
[4:02:28] <ReiDuran> is it still bugged in this version?
[4:02:29] <velgaduere> @pectusumbra might not be anymore
[4:02:34] <speximillian> @pectusumbra Is that true for the Pixel Remaster too
[4:02:35] <crimsonharvest> yeah which bugs did they fix here
[4:02:35] <Tha_DiLA> if you give Locke a Genji Glove and a later relic,  he can steal 2x in one turn as well
[4:02:36] <SaltyAzteca> Can you say Ambidextrous Keepo
[4:02:49] <%arkv01> double strike baby
[4:02:49] <+hatok> twohanding a weapon gives you 1.5 times damage, but Genji Glove gives you two attacks
[4:02:55] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @pectusumbra this is the Remaster, they redid the systems. this version came out today
[4:03:00] <lotharrio> As long as you have two good weapons, Genji is better.
[4:03:02] <NanTheDark> BIG NUMBER VS DO COMBO
[4:03:03] <hentaimaxer> if they kept the old bugs it would be hilarious
[4:03:04] <%DreyfussFrost> Genji Glove is just straight *better* than the Gauntlet, mathematically.
[4:03:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so 2 vs 1.5x?
[4:03:11] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> Bannon looking FIERCE
[4:03:14] <Sora9567> Bannon made a vow to never shave until the Empire falls.
[4:03:16] <%arkv01> double strike also matters once you hit strength cap LUL
[4:03:17] <linSP> genji glove is straight up better and it‚Äôs a secret how you get it
[4:03:20] <speximillian> Backrow everyone >_>
[4:03:26] <speximillian> Especially Banon
[4:03:27] <%DreyfussFrost> @cobalt_phoenix_ It's 1x with two different weapons, so if one is weaker it's not quite 2x, but still more than 1.5
[4:03:31] <majindusto> BANON THE LION
[4:03:37] <+pectusumbra> Oh yeah, BACKROW BANON
[4:03:38] <iacus_> A + B vs 1.5 * A

[4:05:17] <%CaptainBeird> he's a green unit
[4:05:29] <majindusto> Banon: My ex wife misses me...BUT HER AIM IS GETTING  BETTER!
[4:05:30] <lotharrio> White Cape is soli.
[4:05:38] <%DreyfussFrost> Correct
[4:05:40] <+anoldtoilet> yes
[4:05:42] <+JefDesenhero> loooocke
[4:05:47] <+pectusumbra> Save it for Locke probably
[4:05:49] <stuffamiriteyea> give it to locke when you can
[4:05:50] <+anoldtoilet> locke is good with it iirc
[4:05:52] <BlackermanZX> Locke
[4:05:53] <+anoldtoilet> yeah
[4:05:54] <megaman_sentinel> just wait
[4:06:02] <linSP> white cape is meant for terra
[4:06:04] <+outer_monologue> unless the weapon provides boost to magic or strength, etc
[4:06:06] <crimsonharvest> once you have better weapons to pick from it gets to be more interesting of a choice
[4:06:07] <+ShinobiPhoenix> this game also still has Spells from weapons, so some things you can use from menu for
[4:06:10] <$SilverRoddo> I take it Mog‚Äôs weapons were un-take-able.

[4:07:58] <OblivionSword1> cape
[4:07:58] <speximillian> Drop your shield woolie
[4:07:59] <%CisealNine> How did you say power-stance before dual-weilding?

[4:09:46] <velgaduere> FRONT ROW BANON FOR CONTENT
[4:09:46] <%Demoli_PT> yuo should really back row him
[4:09:48] <derap41> He doesn't dip he eats cigarettes
[4:09:48] <Sora9567> If Banon falls, he'll immediately die. He has a bad liver. And kidneys.
[4:09:49] <hassanico2> Oh god I'm hearing the music for the first time
[4:09:53] <hassanico2> Mmmmm delicious for my ears
[4:09:57] <crimsonharvest> pray is free
[4:09:58] <+pectusumbra> AoE heal for free. spam it all the time
[4:09:59] <Clyderso> Banon says yall need jesus
[4:10:02] <%arkv01> I remember the old strat guide saying this is grind central cause of banon being your healbot
[4:10:03] <badugidugi> pray is OP
[4:10:04] <Neoripo> I dunno about this instrumental version.....
[4:10:10] <KobeTeeth90> Put Terra and Bannon in the Back Row
[4:10:17] <$SilverRoddo> ‚ÄúI guess we know why they call‚Äôem Rapids and not Slowpids!‚Äù
[4:10:17] <linSP> pray is not magic I guess
[4:10:18] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Move Bannon to the back row
[4:10:18] <%DreyfussFrost> And this is where you just attack with Terra and then hold the auto-battle button LUL
[4:10:18] <Zourath> Fun fact: This is a popular xp farm area, since it was fully automatable with a rubber band.
[4:10:21] <hassanico2> "I am the healer watch me die to a stiff breeze"
[4:10:26] <majindusto> Woolie  loves Banon now
[4:10:27] <crimsonharvest> cant suplex a guy with no leverage against the ground
[4:10:29] <lotharrio> How ya gonna body slam a flying enemy?
[4:10:32] <speximillian> Can't suplex flyers
[4:10:32] <hentaimaxer> @kobeteeth90 yeah I too am triggered
[4:10:34] <NanTheDark> Can't use Meteor Strike on Flying
[4:10:34] <hassanico2> Yo how did Woolie react to Sabin's inputs?
[4:10:35] <lotharrio> No torque.
[4:10:36] <SaltyAzteca> You cant suplex fliers, youre a ground type Kappa
[4:10:44] <SilverFaustX> u can grind to lvl 99 on the raft while going in a loop
[4:10:45] <+Mendin> @lotharrio It's called the Siberian Blizzard
[4:10:48] <%townzzzzz> CHOOSE YOUR PATH NOW
[4:10:53] <+pectusumbra> this is up to reggie now
[4:10:58] <speximillian> Sabin cannot protect the skies
[4:10:59] <raye0gin> i know woolie doesn't like it, but never stop praying
[4:10:59] <%arkv01> oh I LOVE this water improvement

[4:11:10] <+Falkdaddu> Time for the infinite farm!
[4:11:21] <%arkv01> is that why minh messaged? is it lvl 99 grind time?
[4:11:38] <$SilverRoddo> Just leave the game on for 3 days and grind
[4:11:44] <%Demoli_PT> you can't meteor strike certain enemies
[4:11:46] <Teradyne87> It's not great to farm xp in this though. You don't increase stats, only hp/mp until later
[4:11:50] <+pectusumbra> can't suplex a flyer I think?
[4:11:51] <majindusto> WE GRINDIN'
[4:11:53] <DuoScratch> Sleepin' on Aura Cannon, when it SMASHES single targets hard.

[4:12:10] <%Demoli_PT> yes
[4:12:11] <CrimsonGargoyle> fighting Nargacugas over a river does seem like a pretty cool setpiece
[4:12:11] <+Acecorleone> yes
[4:12:12] <+outer_monologue> grinding here means missing esper stat boosts though
[4:12:13] <Neoripo> You can grind for days here
[4:12:14] <NanTheDark> Yes
[4:12:15] <+Jiggisnipe> Sabin ain't Zangief
[4:12:15] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Can't hit airborn targets
[4:12:16] <%Demoli_PT> usually you cant suplex fliers
[4:12:18] <DuoScratch> It is, if it flies, you ain't suplexing it.
[4:12:22] <%DreyfussFrost> Row changes only last until the end of the current fight.  You have to change default rows in the menu.
[4:12:30] <jaysondeez> row in menu
[4:12:31] <lotharrio> That's what it is, yeah. Aura Cannon is your big DPR

[4:49:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's a new IP, he's not gonna get spoiled on anything besides gameplay mechanics maybe

[4:52:19] <velgaduere> @MayLeFay well mind you, that's more for the people who assume that Reggie will be playing, or seem to be upset that he won't be
[4:52:21] <Blank9> yeah I'm not able to run elden ring because my cpu, and no ps5 so looks like it's time to be banished to the ps4 framerate zone

[4:52:37] <@Solidus_113> Elden Ring mostly has rough CPU usage, the GPU is mostly fine. a 1060 6GB can run it at 60fps with optimized settings
[4:52:58] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
