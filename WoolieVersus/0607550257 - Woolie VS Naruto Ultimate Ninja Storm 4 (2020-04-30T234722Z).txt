[0:01:44] <+tearknack> @Menitta the thing about tsukihime is that its jsut shittier Kara no Kyoukai
[0:01:49] <%masterpiecejeremy> I remember this fight being the last good thing in the anime
[0:01:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> fate fans dont play melty. they watch fate zero and complain that the rest of franchise isnt like it PowerUpL BabyRage PowerUpR
[0:01:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:02:28] <+Bluydee> people who’ve watched zero first and never read the novel
[0:02:34] <TheAceol> @FuqBoiSlim Ah, but those are the Fate secondaries, they don't matter. /s, but still kinda.

[0:04:26] <%Wool> wait so is this GIFG now or NUNS4
[0:04:27] <KingVantq> people talking about fate?
[0:04:28] <TheAceol> @tearknack Boy, the parts of Zero with Kiritsugu are the WORST parts. He's the biggest fucking edgelord, he's the true version of Ow the Edge
[0:04:35] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Garden of Sinners & Magicians Night > All other Type moon trash
[0:04:38] <%optimasmaximas> @perfectsalami not if we count the boruto time travel arc Kappa
[0:04:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yes King the MANs anime
[0:04:42] <staticshock5> @thepimpguin Really? That says a lot. Is it worse than Dragon Ball Super's power scaling?
[0:04:43] <KingVantq> @Wool finishing nuns4 then gifg
[0:04:45] <bbHighvalor> when is woolie the coward gonna play Road to BORUTO DarkMode
[0:04:46] <PunishedRaccoon> @Wool nun then gig
[0:04:51] <%perfectsalami> oh right that was a dlc wasnt it
[0:04:51] <itsjobrotho> Kiritsugu is like Shirou with no self-awareness
[0:04:54] <%BisoromiBear> Kirei did nothing wrong
[0:04:56] <phatmac16> Carnival Phantasam > all of Fate
[0:04:59] <ThePimpGuin> @staticshock5 nothing is

[0:05:04] <TheAceol> @phatmac16 THIS THIS THIS

[0:05:05] <+tearknack> @phatmac16 i can agree with that lol
[0:05:15] <Shishi1205> Ghost in the shell music. Rad
[0:05:15] <%optimasmaximas> @itsjobrotho shirou fucking sucks
[0:05:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> @cozygunna SILENCE HERETIC
[0:05:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> We back in there boyos
[0:05:26] <%optimasmaximas> @itsjobrotho well, at least his dub sucks
[0:05:31] <%BisoromiBear> Shiro is the red man
[0:05:31] <phatmac16> Fate chat tonight boys
[0:05:32] <itsjobrotho> And yet he's still better than Kerry
[0:05:35] <@Menitta> I guess they're finishing off nuns
[0:05:38] <%DatAsuna> THis reminds me
[0:05:39] <staticshock5> @thepimpguin Oh ok. I was wondering because Super's power scaling pissed me off.
[0:05:43] <%Solidnick18> ok then
[0:05:46] <%Wool> finish off those nuns like how Kabuto did
[0:05:47] <phatmac16> Shirou is the best boy, Kirei is the best girl.
[0:05:48] <%DatAsuna> I was watching ghost in the shell 2045 during the break
[0:05:49] <%DatAsuna> and boy
[0:05:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> Serenity > Everyone else
[0:05:53] <Shishi1205> LUL
[0:05:57] <+Bluydee> kotomine in zero is kind of lame
[0:05:59] <+roxasoru> Asura Wrath?
[0:06:00] <%DatAsuna> That show is hard to look at
[0:06:04] <%optimasmaximas> i watched fate stay night ubw in dub, and it made me fucking HATE shiro
[0:06:08] <NotHereToStream> listen, whatever you say about fate, ufotable animation is gorgeous
[0:06:08] <knackirontarkus> Shirou’s am excellent character in the VN at least
[0:06:09] <%optimasmaximas> terrible character
[0:06:11] <itsjobrotho> Well I don't know anything about the dub, so I can't even talk about that
[0:06:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @datasuna It looks like some Unity asset store level bullshit.
[0:06:17] <TheAceol> @Bluydee Well no shit, he's the backstory of the Cooler Kotomine
[0:06:21] <phatmac16> yeah Shirou's dub voice is bad
[0:06:27] <Shishi1205> Will Swagbito see the LP to an end?
[0:06:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chat, leave the fate fans alone. this is like their one night every 3 months they get to come out of the gacha caves and be normal
[0:06:33] <%Livelinne> あ～が～〜舞えば～〜～ SingsNote woolieGASM
[0:06:38] <itsjobrotho> Well that stinks
[0:06:40] <%optimasmaximas> @itsjobrotho "people die when they are killed" "you may be correct but you're not right"
[0:06:43] <staticshock5> @notheretostream AKA the Unlimited Budget studio.
[0:06:44] <%DatAsuna> @CommanderSqueaks the story isn't much better. I currently rank it below arise and SSS, above only the scarjo movie
[0:06:47] <ThePimpGuin> @optimasmaximas he's the same in the sub
[0:06:50] <%JohnAtDawn> I would, given the chance, actually stab whoever hired Papenbrook to play Shirou
[0:06:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @fuqboislim "Normal"
[0:06:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Swagbito has had his SWAG status revoked by the council
[0:06:56] <Nekros4442> @optimasmaximas eh, the point is that Shirou has several different incarnations. Depending on circumstance his character changes drastically
[0:06:58] <+Bluydee> "you may be correct but you're not right" is super dope though

[0:26:18] <C4m3r0n0409> THEY DONT
[0:26:18] <%Ya_Boi_AD> YOUR ARC IS A HOLLOW SHELL OF A CHARACTER, SASUKE UCHIHA
[0:26:20] <Hellarussian> it means shut up
[0:26:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Tobirama used blitzball no-jutsu
[0:26:24] <%Ya_Boi_AD> YET PUSSIES GET WET BECAUSE OF YOU
[0:26:24] <+Bluydee> they literally explain this stuff
[0:26:24] <%Livelinne> Sasuke is...kinda shitty character innit...? woolieWUT_TK
[0:26:25] <%alpacasintophats> CHAOTIC STUPID = SASUKE
[0:26:26] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus YES LETS MAKE THE MAN THAT TRIED TO KILL THE VILLAGE HOKAGE
[0:26:27] <%MisterArcanine> Sasuke’s motivations are a fucking mess
[0:26:27] <%Exiliator> He just said how
[0:26:27] <Animorphimagi> hail Dictator Sasuke
[0:26:30] <C4m3r0n0409> SASUKE IS ASS
[0:26:31] <YakumoYomi> STOP THINKING. It's Kishimoto's writing.
[0:26:31] <VidulaSaix> You're getting way too hung up on one aspect of his story and not allowing more to be told to you
[0:26:32] <%Ya_Boi_AD> SASUKE IS THE RICK OF THIS SHOW
[0:26:32] <skewerstar> The War is over, Naruto. But we still have a score to settle!
[0:26:33] <BlackermanZX> Uhh he just said it tho
[0:26:34] <%perfectsalami> This is his plan and it makes NO SENSE
[0:26:35] <ahairysuprise> He wants a utopia
[0:26:35] <@Solidus_113> wandering power dick too strong
[0:26:36] <+Ether101_Prime> Kishimoto's still salty about how his little brother got treated.
[0:26:37] <Blackscience91> It exists purely to create this conflict.
[0:26:39] <arkv01> shhhh woolie, MORALLY HOT
[0:26:41] <LeaIsChill> Absolute power to prevent war
[0:26:41] <%krispen_wa> Sasuke is basically trying to do the Zero Requiem but with more murder
[0:26:42] <lotharrio> He wants to kill a bunch of people who did nothing wrong to him... and then get elected president of the village he betrayed and actively hurt for like five years.
[0:26:43] <CJL_13> He thinks he's The Boss
[0:26:43] <Dementedpenguin> This doesn't even feel like a conclusion. Just a fan service fight.
[0:26:46] <+amiroodude> its called bad writing
[0:26:49] <Hellarussian> Brain: OFF Money: ON
[0:26:49] <dekkitout> This is how you get Danzo apologists, Sasuke
[0:26:50] <%Solidnick18> you could have
[0:26:51] <NotHereToStream> sasuke really just want the n word pass all along

[0:26:51] <gustavozxd> alone FeelsBadMan
[0:26:51] <morningmoondude> Sasuke's motivations are "fuck you, naruto, i'll do anything for you to leave me alone already"

[0:27:22] <dekkitout> Sasuke's taking the work Hokage TOO LITERAL
[0:27:23] <Arnoldoaad1> Also important to note that he is not talking about Konoha, he is talking about all of the villages.
[0:27:23] <scrublord009> THAT'S A DICTATOR MOTHERFUCKER
[0:27:24] <+RaidenKyrielight> Who?
[0:27:25] <%ECRead> Sasuke's literally following the same logic that Madara had at the start
[0:27:26] <charliechambersz> EMO AS ALWAYS
[0:27:26] <%ggbhtg> FEAST on THE ASHES
[0:27:27] <lotharrio> Fucking the current MIZUKAGE AND KAZEKAGE didn't do SHIT to you, or anyone else, Sasuke!
[0:27:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> chat is moving so fast its slowing down my phone LUL
[0:27:28] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:27:29] <LeeOhX> Sasuke thinks to make the village better he has to be a dictator
[0:27:31] <%Ya_Boi_AD> SASUKE YOU LITERALLY JUST FUCKING FOUGHT TOGETHER
[0:27:31] <gustavozxd> itachi directly says "chill bro" and sasuke goes "alright imma kill everyone"
[0:27:32] <+SilverDevilfish> Let's reflect on this. Naruto is the voice of reason. NARUTO is the voice of reason
[0:27:33] <NorthGrizzly> Naruto is calling is you a idiot
[0:27:35] <C4m3r0n0409> EW

[0:27:54] <charliechambersz> Naruto: Sasuke, you and I, we're like brothers but only closer
[0:27:56] <VidulaSaix> Thats the point Woolie LUL
[0:27:57] <Hellarussian> Sasuke spits on Itachis grave for the unteenth time
[0:28:01] <+Gutsandlove> Itachi is like: goddammit sasuke
[0:28:01] <%legacy0117> You should stole a second purple eye Sasuke, mighta gave you enough power to win.
[0:28:02] <C4m3r0n0409> KISHIMOTO SUCKS
[0:28:03] <+RaidenKyrielight> He's misunderstanding his message harder than Major Zero misunderstood The Boss' message
[0:28:06] <%MisterArcanine> Itachi watching from heaven is like “come on bro...”
[0:28:08] <%ggbhtg> TEAM 7 THOOOO Sasookay!
[0:28:09] <darkbat52> Talk no jutsu
[0:28:11] <%Ya_Boi_AD> Let's be fucking honest, Naruto X Sasuke would be a toxic relationship as well
[0:28:11] <staticshock5> @woolieversus When Naruto makes the most sense, something is terribly wrong.
[0:28:12] <%generalve> THOSE WHO IGNORE PAST WILL REPEAT
[0:28:12] <0rond> I remember when the manga came out and people straight up colored sasuke's rinnegan red because just no one knew what the fuck it was
[0:28:12] <+Ether101_Prime> What's so wrong with just wanting fight?
[0:28:12] <emeraldskrull> YOUR new empire???? YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!
[0:28:13] <XrosHawk> Yes the memories of team 7...the like 6 months worth of memories or something
[0:28:15] <%jiggy_snipe> just fight over coming back to village
[0:28:15] <gustavozxd> that would be sooo much better
[0:28:16] <ChansonNoire> I'M GOING TO cut off my past... and BECOME HOKAGE
[0:28:17] <Dementedpenguin> No we need DRAMA
[0:28:18] <ISkyHunterI> naruto post pain arc was a mistake
[0:28:19] <+Jake_Protagonist> Its almost like they HAD a reason with him destroying the village, but NO the stupid war arc happened
[0:28:19] <DonatelloJose> naw we need one last heel turn
[0:28:19] <@Menitta> Funsies
[0:28:19] <Dementedpenguin> Kappa

[0:28:23] <+Taglog7> do doo dooooo
[0:28:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @raidenkyrielight Are you saying Itachi is The Boss of Naruto???
[0:28:24] <+hoenhime344> The Night Comes For Us style
[0:28:25] <ahairysuprise> It could have been a friendly spar
[0:28:27] <rosemon5001> in the anime it explains he belives the whole system is wrong and he will fix it @WoolieVersus
[0:28:28] <petwisk> it's "the patch is free for us tô rule" all over again
[0:28:28] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> They coulda just duked it out for the Hokage fight. Shit, DBZ does it ALL THE TIME with Goku and Vegeta
[0:28:31] <%Exiliator> Itachi went along with killing his entire clan, hed probably be on board with this plan
[0:28:33] <fist_wizard_jay> Fuck this monument WE FIGHTIN
[0:28:39] <%mitchteck> Kill the past
[0:28:39] <%Ya_Boi_AD> Chat you're gonna love this fight then
[0:28:39] <scrublord009> Naruto did a grow up for a bit SASUKE HAS NOT
[0:28:41] <charliechambersz> WE ARE FIGHTING DREAMERS
[0:28:42] <+Jake_Protagonist> You coudl've cut here after Pain and it would've been FINE
[0:28:42] <BurningSaph> Going to beat the friendship into you sasuke
[0:28:45] <C4m3r0n0409> THAT WOULD BE GOOD
[0:28:46] <lotharrio> NONE of the current Kage did SHIT to Sasuke except swing back when he tried to kill them. Worst would be Cloud but even he is sort of trying to make all the shit his predecessor did.
[0:28:48] <LeeOhX> MONEY. START.
[0:28:49] <+RaidenKyrielight> @FuqBoiSlim I like Itachi but i'm not disrespecting The Boss like that
[0:28:49] <@Solidus_113> DBFZ CLASH
[0:28:52] <%krispen_wa> THE TITLE CLASH
[0:28:52] <+Taglog7> SYMBOLISM
[0:28:52] <karl_rex> Yeah but Kishimoto can't write a rival for shit
[0:28:53] <+Bluydee> of all the things to get mad about I feel like Sasuke's reasoning isn't that wild

[0:31:11] <LeeOhX> What
[0:31:14] <morningmoondude> I think Sasuke's motivations make sense in the sense that if Naruto is gone he can literally do WHATEVER HE WANTS because he has the power of god

[0:33:53] <%Ashenik1> Sasuske wants to create a world where he controls everything so you get to live stable life, not liberal but stable. So he wants all mighty government that knows what to do. Hidden village allowed for the genocide of Uchiha becausee of weak government. I think he kindda explains that in an anime

[0:34:08] <irfan_> real talk im glad the game skipped the gundam part of the fight gameplaywise
[0:34:09] <skewerstar> No but it's an Ashura. don't you get it? LUL
[0:34:12] <+th3madness> member when making good clones was considered forbidden knowledge
[0:34:12] <%Solidnick18> freee falling
[0:34:13] <XrosHawk> It's just a semantic difference
[0:34:14] <%jiggy_snipe> the sound i think
[0:34:17] <+KilogramHours> SWORD SHAPED
[0:34:19] <dero45> Just destroying there own reality
[0:34:20] <%krispen_wa> Raikiri was supposed to be advanced Chidori
[0:34:20] <fist_wizard_jay> Oh hey its...Indra's Arrow....and Asura....yaaaay
[0:34:21] <Arek_1> Nope.
[0:34:22] <%fetrigon> Oh so he wants to unite all countries under him even if that means he has to do it alone.
[0:34:22] <rubbishbinge> It's Japanese legend
[0:34:22] <dundore77> Chidori is just a jutsu. Raikiri has lightening element fused into it
[0:34:23] <+toastybites> Kakashi cut lightning once with it
[0:34:23] <%optimasmaximas> there is a slight difference from what i remember
[0:34:23] <arkv01> raikiri is lightning cutter
[0:34:25] <+KilogramHours> Raikiri is sword while Chidori is a punch
[0:34:25] <+SleepingPliskin> raikiri requires less signs
[0:34:26] <lotharrio> In practice, it's visual and auditory.
[0:34:27] <Malik1002> no not really
[0:34:27] <Super_Voltekka> They're named after a real samurai sword
[0:34:28] <+gliph13> just by name
[0:34:29] <+Bluydee> here's the dope part
[0:34:29] <+teddybomber> people have been arguing that for years and no one knows
[0:34:29] <%Ya_Boi_AD> KINGDOM HEARTS
[0:34:31] <SON0ROUS> chidori is a burst and raikiri is a blade
[0:34:34] <+Memitim> just the name
[0:34:36] <%alpacasintophats> relatively semantics
[0:34:37] <VidulaSaix> Raikiri is unfinished Chidori isnt it?
[0:34:38] <C4m3r0n0409> yep
[0:34:39] <phatmac16> yup
[0:34:39] <jubejube56> I mean does it matter when we have meteors?
[0:34:40] <+Dakuu75> I think it's the same difference between "Rasengan" and "Giant rasengan" it's basically the same
[0:34:40] <ChansonNoire> it makes a different sound so you can identify the ninja using Keepo
[0:34:40] <gustavozxd> o espadão
[0:34:42] <phatmac16> he's right
[0:34:42] <C4m3r0n0409> HES RIGHT

[0:47:00] <charliechambersz> yes
[0:47:00] <Amardeux> they did
[0:47:01] <%Jetzord> Well since the hand wings are webbed, they'd probably be good for swimming

[0:47:01] <NorthGrizzly> Stop being stupid sasuke
[0:47:02] <%ggbhtg> YOU FUCKING BET
[0:47:02] <Bakafied> 100% yes
[0:47:03] <+MJo367> The anime is one big flashback
[0:47:03] <%legacy0117> So freaking bizzare this anime is.
[0:47:04] <Kira2993> YES, it is better here
[0:47:04] <ExplosiveLime> yes

[0:47:27] <+SleepingPliskin> no the anime does it better
[0:47:27] <VidulaSaix> Both are really good. Anime is worth watching
[0:47:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> FRIENDS
[0:47:33] <lotharrio> @BallerSwagBro9k Curse Mark. Based off of Jugo's bloodline limit. Which is basically an ability to channel natural energy, like a Sage. Orochimaru couldn't get a proper Sage to teach him Sage techniques, so he hacked his own version.
[0:47:34] <0rond> you can't see it clearly but naruto's face is bumpy and beaten up now
[0:47:39] <+SilverDevilfish> Sasuke, don't know if you're paying attention, you're getting your shit kicked in
[0:47:40] <0rond> it's good
[0:47:41] <charliechambersz> I love this part

[1:21:04] <Mr_Rakjo> leterally a clone
[1:21:04] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus OROCHIMARU IS A WOMAN IN BORUTO
[1:21:04] <rubbishbinge> The novels address how Shikamaru is not okay with any of this
[1:21:05] <gustavozxd> it's awful
[1:21:05] <%oscar_m510> Blame Naruto
[1:21:05] <%MyNameIsRasus> KABUTO RUNS THE SICKEST ORPHANAGE
[1:21:05] <+gliph13> Oriochimaru is on constant watch by Yamato and is allowed no freedom.
[1:21:06] <+HenshinSupreme> good friends they are them sound dickheads
[1:21:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> he sucks
[1:21:08] <morningmoondude> OrochimaruXOrochimaru
[1:21:09] <vVAstrAVv> why are they cloning HIM
[1:21:10] <$SilverRoddo> He got Vegeta-ed.
[1:21:10] <+teddybomber> Orochimaru gets away with it all
[1:21:11] <ISkyHunterI> Orichimaru didn't even stop human experiments
[1:21:11] <lotharrio> It's vague, but yes, probably Orochimaru.
[1:21:12] <hamahiroyuki> that end made me so done with this whole series. i couldnt give less of a shit about boruto
[1:21:12] <+bluedude153> Ochimaru is
[1:21:12] <%Exiliator> Kabuto runs an orphanage
[1:21:14] <YakumoYomi> Orochimaru is "pardoned" because of Naruto.
[1:21:15] <+GreenCMD> "Hey can't keep getting away with it!"
[1:21:17] <%jiggy_snipe> oh he's on house arrest?
[1:21:18] <NorthGrizzly> In fairness Kabuto had to change who is is to break free of the justu
[1:21:18] <VidulaSaix> Yeah, Sasuke being let go is annoying but whatever but Orochimaru being allowed to roam free is legitimately horrifying
[1:21:19] <phatmac16> Orochimaru becomes a comedy gag
[1:21:20] <staticshock5> @woolieversus They're not forgiven. They're constantly watching him to make sure he doesn't do anything evil again.
[1:21:21] <+bluedude153> ochimaru is locked up
[1:21:21] <+Solid_Stro> Sneks brah
[1:21:21] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus In Boruto, Orochimaru changed into the body of a woman. TRANS RIGHT
[1:21:23] <Twin_Hallow> naruto is the one who does it
[1:21:23] <CJL_13> Yamato has to keep an eye on him
[1:21:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ROCHI WAS INVITED TO THE WEDDING
[1:21:26] <CozyGUNNA> theres a manga chapter thats pretty good
[1:21:30] <%kingkeldeo31> Mitsuki doesn't even know if Orchimaru is his dad or his mom
[1:21:31] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus Orochimaru got vegeta'd harder than vegeta
[1:21:31] <%eyezehuhh> I could be wrong but I thought he was a lab baby from the second hokage and orochimaru
[1:21:31] <0rond> orochimaru X human expermintation is the true OTP
[1:21:32] <dekkitout> So remember WAY back in Naruto where Orochi said he "found a new body"?
[1:21:33] <StarlitStunner> Snake Dad! SNAKE DAD!
[1:21:34] <CozyGUNNA> that explains mitzuki
[1:21:37] <vincerocmm> s0m3t1m3s
[1:21:38] <arkv01> hey, that's progressive
[1:21:38] <+GenesisKnight> Yeah that makes sense
[1:21:38] <C4m3r0n0409> SNAKE DAAAD
[1:21:38] <+sevorai> Mitsuki also has snake sage powers
[1:21:39] <%kin_jo> Orochimaru is LITERALLY is doing cartoon antics in the background of the ending fluff
[1:21:40] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:21:40] <%legacy0117> Anyways, nothing was learned....And that's even scarier.
[1:21:42] <+tearknack> orochimaru is switching bodie sin canon, its not that wierd
[1:21:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Snake "DAD"
[1:21:45] <C4m3r0n0409> ORPHANAGE BOY
[1:21:45] <tolloponik> he changed bodies I think
[1:21:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> Orochimaru is legit nonbinary at this point
[1:21:46] <+louiswho> snek mom is snek dad
[1:21:47] <VidulaSaix> Yep its bad
[1:21:47] <%nintega010> Mitsuki is cool
[1:21:47] <%cumurasame> @WoolieVersus My personal theory is that Orochimaru put the Sannin dna into a testtube and made Mitsuki. Mitsu can mean 3. Like SANnin.
[1:21:47] <%BisoromiBear> Orochimaru is a MILF atpGasm
[1:21:49] <+oda_flobunaga> Mitsuki= Solidus Sanke
[1:21:49] <+amiroodude> orochimaru fucks himself confirmed
[1:21:49] <+paladinstarbuster> HES NOT FORGIVEN
[1:21:52] <jase__x> OROCHIMARU IS A SNEK
[1:21:54] <phatmac16> OROCHIMARU IS A COMEDY GAG
[1:21:55] <%derap41> Pardon Hitler
[1:21:55] <+RaidenKyrielight> He was forgiven for being progressive
[1:21:55] <Bamcc2> Boruto DLC STORY WOOLIE

[1:21:57] <%DukeBlack_> no
[1:21:58] <morningmoondude> OrochiMILF
[1:21:58] <$SilverRoddo> Put a Bad Man on Orochimaru.
[1:21:58] <C4m3r0n0409> PRETTY MUCH

[1:22:00] <+gliph13> Yes
[1:22:00] <+Bluydee> Yes
[1:22:01] <+bizzer10> he died for his sins
[1:22:01] <C4m3r0n0409> NOPE
[1:22:01] <StarlitStunner> Snek
[1:22:01] <bunnyscruff> I honestly like the new team seven better than the old team seven mainly cause Sarada and Mitsuki are way better than Sasuke and Sakura
[1:22:01] <ghoulspan> Orochimaru is the maverick to counter a maverick that might appear in the new era
[1:22:01] <black_pariah> SUPER HOUSE ARREST
[1:22:02] <0rond> orochimaru X human expermintation is the true OTP
[1:22:02] <+aishman> YAWP
[1:22:02] <%prime_name> Not really
[1:22:02] <%oscar_m510> pretty much
[1:22:03] <rubbishbinge> He is not
[1:22:03] <charliechambersz> Yes
[1:22:04] <%DukeBlack_> It's the fact he can't die
[1:22:04] <%Irridium> Orochimaru literally killed the third. I mean yeah the Third was a dick but still
[1:22:05] <%jiggy_snipe> I think he's under constant survellience
[1:22:05] <Monkeyweed21> He healed the 5 kage
[1:22:05] <%Fujiwara_92> Yes
[1:22:05] <Kira2993> Just like Freezer Kappa
[1:22:06] <arkv01> WAR PASSES
[1:22:06] <+KilogramHours> YAMATO HOUSE ARREST
[1:22:07] <Augus7717> Orochimaru is HILARIOUS at the end @WoolieVersus
[1:22:07] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> They do address it
[1:22:07] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus BTW OROCHIMARU BECOMES A MILF
[1:22:07] <masheshardest> Orochimaru is a legit nazi scientist
[1:22:08] <rubbishbinge> Yes
[1:22:08] <+Toblo1> @WoolieVersus He's basically in Super House Arrest 24-7
[1:22:09] <mark1247> YES IN THE ANIME
[1:22:10] <C4m3r0n0409> DONT WORRY
[1:22:10] <brunoberserk> remember when orochimaru killed a lot of kids
[1:22:10] <+kewlmyc> He's on house arrest
[1:22:11] <%Exiliator> Its a world were every other person has killed at least 1 person ykno
[1:22:11] <BlackermanZX> they do adress it
[1:22:11] <vincerocmm> th3 vva/
[1:22:12] <Twin_Hallow> not fully
[1:22:12] <ghoulspan> yes
[1:22:13] <CJL_13> When Tsunade finds out Mitsuki is the son of Orochimaru Tsunade is like "NARUTO WHAT THE FUCK"
[1:22:14] <%krispen_wa> Sasuke killed a few people, but Orochimaru was literally doing Unit 731 shit
[1:22:14] <+RocketBarrel> HE KILLED THE 3RD HOKAGE
[1:22:14] <zamzoph> What bad things? Kappa
[1:22:15] <+GreenCMD> Yamato has to guard him but yeah
[1:22:15] <%nintega010> Orochimaru they keep tabs on him
[1:22:15] <%Kriss1827> orochimaru is on probation woolie
[1:22:16] <+teddybomber> Orochimaru is like really hard to kill might as well have him work for the village
[1:22:17] <rubbishbinge> It is addressed
[1:22:18] <%kin_jo> Nah, but look how goofy he and Yamato are
[1:22:18] <+amiroodude> its fiinnnne
[1:22:18] <%oscar_m510> Forgive and Forget
[1:22:19] <dekkitout> Orochimaru becomes a bit background character in the post story
[1:22:19] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus He still has labs everywhere where he experiments on people and it's treated as a gag. Boruto has some fucking awful shit
[1:22:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> Orchimaru ascends beyond the gender binary LUL NonBinaryPride

[1:52:27] <+th3madness> 4chan continues to have value
[1:52:28] <lotharrio> Actual last time I'll say it, @WoolieVersus. Kishimoto has a brother (maybe a twin) who is also a mangaka, whose series touches on very similar themes of brotherhood. They both seem to have problems with each other since they never discuss the other in interviews.

[1:53:06] <Blackscience91> Kabuto is forgiven
[1:53:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> Kabuto runs the strongest orphanage
[1:53:06] <+croxeye> why is rokudaime hokage beating up a 13 year old?
[1:53:07] <lotharrio> @apheral I think he already knew
[1:53:07] <%Kriss1827> he becomes a nun
[1:53:08] <+HenshinSupreme> kabuto is super chill godmotherfather
[1:53:08] <Morning_Asakura> who still cares about spoilers

[1:53:08] <hamahiroyuki> who cares about boruto spoilers at this point
[1:53:09] <Damie904> Woolie you should look up the actual scene where Obito gives kakashi the Sharingan. The game saved you from how dumb it really is.

[2:27:37] <Twin_Hallow> he uses a eye patch to hide the eye
[2:27:38] <+sevorai> Sasuke's rinnegan ability lets him swap places with whatever
[2:27:39] <Shardlab> The man with no name Sasuke
[2:27:39] <+kyh9> They have computers
[2:27:41] <Damie904> It's not a turn off. Nagato never turned it off

[2:28:06] <%DarkNerdShawny> hides with his hair
[2:28:07] <%oscar_m510> He hides it bc then people would know he has it
[2:28:07] <Chiletran> like kakashi
[2:28:10] <Nekros4442> Sasuke usually has his hair hiding it or 1 eye closed
[2:28:10] <Andrew95101> its like pain he cant turn it off
[2:28:12] <+kyh9> He succ
[2:28:14] <BlackermanZX> he has 1 arm btw
[2:28:18] <+TheOneCalledRock> MAKE UP YOUR MIND CHAT
[2:28:19] <Damie904> The same way Pain never turned it off, it's not a jutsu. That's his narutal eye color now.
[2:28:20] <sgtgoatmilk181> he covers it with his hair, the tomoe in his eyes go away when he turns it off I believe
[2:28:21] <%oscar_m510> it's like Pain/Nagato who couldn't turn it off
[2:28:21] <Blackscience91> He can't shut it off
[2:28:22] <ThePimpGuin> he can reduce its power to a normal rinnegan but thats it
[2:28:24] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> he hides it with emo hair
[2:28:25] <+th3madness> BEAT THE WIFE

[2:33:57] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Honest question though, with all the horrible bullshit and sometimes genuinely good stuff, are you glad you finally got closure on the story?
[2:33:58] <Augus7717> LUL
[2:34:02] <C4m3r0n0409> Animation is the only good thing

[2:34:06] <brockyboi96> boruto manga is okay
[2:34:06] <clack14> I don't love crack, you love crack.
[2:34:07] <333agus333> Literally the only good thing about Boruto is episode 65, to see a high budget fan service fight
[2:34:07] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:34:07] <+LUN4RKiD> @WoolieVersus The first scene of Boruto will be enough to turn you off

[2:35:50] <+LUN4RKiD> It feels like you can stop at least
[2:35:51] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> the manga is full of cool lore about the space aliens

[2:36:18] <TexasDice> can we talk about the fact that his name is BORUTO
[2:36:20] <+OddityOn> Talk about the new boruto opening that tried to reference all the OG Naruto OPs
[2:36:20] <Visored34> One Piece is worse because it stretchs the episodes instead of filler, you cant skip that
[2:36:20] <%jiggy_snipe> yea I can see the Boruto's dad thing being real if the Boruto is its on machine
[2:36:21] <%jinking79> then the Manga

[2:36:27] <%derap41> Then scrape the powder bag
[2:36:28] <phatmac16> ENOUGH NARUTO
[2:36:32] <VidulaSaix> Honest question though, with all the horrible bullshit and sometimes genuinely good stuff, are you glad you finally got closure on the story?

[2:38:24] <lotharrio> Alright, last time I'll say it, possibly at the point of @WoolieVersus giving me shit for already having read it. Kishimoto has a brother (maybe a twin) who is also a mangaka, whose series touches on very similar themes of brotherhood. They both seem to have problems with each other since they never discuss the other in interviews.

[2:42:41] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus There is Naruto chapter 700. Worth reading. No new threat, just character lives. See Guy's fate. Then there's Naruto Gaiden (700+1 through 700+10). That's a new threat. THEN it's Boruto, but whatever.

[2:52:25] <%oscar_m510> I honestly loved SuperEyePatchWolf's video about Naruto
[2:52:27] <rubbishbinge> Novels do a good job
[2:52:30] <LilacKing> He stopped after that salty bet loss
[2:52:31] <+LUN4RKiD> woolie never loved our knucklehead ninja :(

[2:52:49] <brockyboi96> this setup is MENACING
[2:52:49] <scrublord009> Woolie came back and he leaves
[2:52:50] <Cpsaint> After the end of Naruto the only worth content is: The 2 movies, the Sarada arc and the 700 manga chapter
[2:52:55] <KidKaiser23> Fuck, I knew I shoulda ducked my homework smh
[2:52:56] <+OddityOn> DID YOU THO?
[2:52:57] <+skylerpilot> Night Guy almost makes up for it though
[2:52:58] <Nekros4442> Lets just watch Night Guy again
[2:52:58] <%derap41> Was it worth it==
[2:52:59] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus There is Naruto chapter 700. Worth reading. No new threat, just character lives. See Guy's fate. Then there's Naruto Gaiden (700+1 through 700+10). That's a new threat. THEN it's Boruto, but whatever.
[2:53:01] <+ChaosEmralds> stop mihn, he's buying it!
[2:53:13] <+ComplexChampion> i wonder why Luffy all rubbery dagamerKek
