[0:00:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so how bout them dwarves
[0:00:47] <GameBoyAdvance> Hi woolie :)
[0:00:49] <%smyld> Why the hood up Reggie?
[0:01:03] <DaKnightWarrior> indeed
[0:01:04] <Bail_Seven> cant be worst than last time
[0:01:04] <+bigchuck> the woolie plush over reggies head is giving me a whiplash of nostalgia
[0:01:05] <Parapattern> Reggie chilly
[0:01:14] <%nicversus> rectumify those wrongs
[0:01:17] <Lancaster_H> i mean, it was entertaining
[0:01:28] <joebeilieves> Big fan almighty Woolie. From the small island of Guam
[0:01:33] <+Eldith> I have one quick question Woolie have you seen the OMNI Arcade ODIN drop in mod for fightsticks and your thoughts on it?
[0:01:35] <+Cuon_Alpinus> ghostrunner round 2 baybee
[0:01:36] <Pnutz409> Reggie cosplaying as jin
[0:01:46] <+NYCrownlessKing> ask woolie about the lore reggie
[0:01:49] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[0:01:58] <%czeekytv> time for some homework
[0:01:59] <Pnutz409> lol
[0:02:04] <dds333a> alright, let's do this again
[0:02:07] <leith_aziz> Hi chat
[0:02:28] <%czeekytv> Minh had a tough job yesterday, I think he did well
[0:02:29] <%Lion_kun> Your soul was dying at points
[0:02:29] <%thetunnelhomer> The Funny part is that there is gonna be more Nier content from the looks of it.
[0:02:38] <+Cuon_Alpinus> 24
[0:02:43] <%kyh9> Did you cry for the dwarves?
[0:02:59] <Darren716> #loredwarf
[0:03:06] <%kyh9> Vashed POtatoes
[0:03:09] <Lancaster_H> dorf
[0:03:13] <DatAsuna> big community night
[0:03:15] <+Therealmusty> boat
[0:03:19] <+snausages_> The lore dorf stream was really hype and fun woolie thanks
[0:03:23] <%HollowedIdjit> Minh The Goat
[0:03:24] <+Cuon_Alpinus> skullgod tryna throw and get minh sent to PRISON
[0:03:30] <leith_aziz> That sounds really nice. I didnt watch the stream because I just started watching Nier and FFXIV isnt my thing unfortunately.
[0:03:35] <%kyh9> DWARVES ARE IN NIER NOW
[0:03:35] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Did Mihn get home ok?
[0:03:43] <DatAsuna> Tall is justice
[0:03:53] <%kyh9> All the new Nier protagonists are Dwarves
[0:04:01] <%czeekytv> @leith_aziz it had big Nier spoilers so that was a good move
[0:04:03] <Parapattern> God those people are so immature
[0:04:05] <+mikesapartment> ff14 is super story heavy
[0:04:07] <EvolNom> @woolieversus your podcast get me through the workday, thank you for the great content
[0:04:09] <%nicversus> that's a kind way of saying "pants shitting rage"
[0:04:22] <+bigchuck> @WoolieVersus have you ever had interest in playing any MMO at any point?
[0:04:22] <leith_aziz> @czeekytv: Woof. Good call then
[0:04:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MMO fans are cringe
[0:04:29] <Deko_> people actually mad at that LUL
[0:04:29] <%thetunnelhomer> I'm like 60% sure the Dwarf from FF14 is in Nier:Reincarnation.
[0:04:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> Rise from the trashpile.
[0:04:29] <+skyheys> the sandbagging was funny until you started getting mad at people getting mad LUL
[0:04:32] <+snausages_> some of the FFXIV community are very defensive of aspects of the game like that
[0:04:38] <%kyh9> LMAO
[0:04:47] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:04:49] <leith_aziz> uhhhh...
[0:04:50] <dds333a> You didn't, Woolz Kappa
[0:04:52] <DaKnightWarrior> lytJEEZ
[0:04:56] <masterfire23> no my opinion tho
[0:04:59] <Lancaster_H> #justice4dorf
[0:04:59] <leith_aziz> Fun is.....fun
[0:05:01] <nabs96> look woolie if u had fun that's what mattered, who cares what other people think
[0:05:02] <+snausages_> like not every little bit of filler quest is 'high quality world building', speaking as a xiv player
[0:05:02] <%johnny_gogo> PEOPLE NEED TO CHILL
[0:05:04] <masterfire23> BabyRage
[0:05:07] <%nicversus> I saw that guy in the mentions, and I was like c'mon woolieONEGUY
[0:05:08] <DaKnightWarrior> Some people man...
[0:05:09] <@Solidus_113> it was fiiiiine
[0:05:09] <+matter8820> VIDEO GAMES
[0:05:10] <enZymeth> It was great tho
[0:05:11] <Alice_Lufenia> I love XIV and thought the stream was fine
[0:05:12] <Parapattern> Those people are INSANE
[0:05:20] <+Xeno351> had way higher views then normal for that stream
[0:05:22] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ HYPE
[0:05:23] <+snausages_> woolie it was fun ignore malding nerds
[0:05:23] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Much love from Brandon P and Maribel O. Any plans on playing Returnal? I engineered a giant chunk of the first person story elements.
[0:05:23] <passserby> ignoring all importent dwarf lore smh
[0:05:25] <leith_aziz> I mean, it could be boring, but I wouldnt nag on the guy
[0:05:26] <%johnny_gogo> have fun like me or RIOT
[0:05:28] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh, it wasn't Three Houses bad.
[0:05:28] <@Menitta> yeeeee ghostrunner
[0:05:29] <DatAsuna> looking forward to the podcast after lol
[0:05:32] <dds333a> You jumped in like 3/4 into the story, how'd you expect to understand anything CarlSmile
[0:05:32] <%Lion_kun> So unwatchable he had 1.4k viewers lol
[0:05:33] <Jontman42> I'm sorry you're mad about this
[0:05:36] <%badfleshboy> Fun must happen only how I say it should
[0:05:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Dont give those people the time of day
[0:05:38] <winner_92> Local man gets blown up on Twitter for playing game the way he likes
[0:05:38] <%czeekytv> It wasn't an FFXIV stream and some people didn't get that memo I guess?
[0:05:40] <%nosubstancex> FF14 Reddit is salty as fudge
[0:05:41] <dds333a> Oh well, I enjoyed it
[0:05:42] <DatAsuna> 3H was way worse yeah
[0:05:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> 1400 people surely disagree, im certain they were having a good time
[0:05:45] <leith_aziz> My tip would just be dont watch the stream
[0:05:51] <+nemtehe> fuck em woolie
[0:05:52] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie ppl think that cuz they warned u to just watch it lol
[0:05:53] <EvolNom> Oh noes how dare you not magically read their minds and stream to their will… idiots
[0:05:54] <KaiserMario> It was very good in my opinion, very funny even with all the sandbagging
[0:05:55] <@Menitta> Man, were people that upset? I wish I could've watched it
[0:05:56] <%Arancet> @nosubstancex cool, i'm really excited for returnal
[0:05:56] <NeonBloo25> If you have fun and nobody gets hurt then there’s no wrong way to play a game
[0:05:57] <%HollowedIdjit> You probavly could have sandbagged less, but it was a fun time all the same
[0:05:58] <Louie_Salmon> And then it comes up on the podcast, so that's a third
[0:06:01] <%andrewofbob> If you don't like what you're watching, stop watching
[0:06:05] <Pnutz409> cant believe you played a game how you wanted. heh
[0:06:12] <FutureCopLGF> three houses was magical
[0:06:12] <+Xeno351> i viewed it as a sequel to the xcom lp
[0:06:15] <leith_aziz> People nagged on 3H? Ahh, thats a shamebecause I love that game
[0:06:19] <+nemtehe> fuck em
[0:06:24] <DatAsuna> TBF on youtube the sandbag will be almost a whole episode right at the start, so...
[0:06:25] <leith_aziz> *Shame because
[0:06:25] <dds333a> King kong was a LEGENDARILY bad one off
[0:06:28] <tomdwarf> I mean, I had a feeling that was gonna happen, so I set my expectations. Not surprised.
[0:06:34] <Sonny_Firestorm> But enough of that Ivalice murdering game, what's on the menu for today?
[0:06:35] <dds333a> But that's pretty much it
[0:06:36] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex gifted a Tier 1 sub to Arancet! They have given 11 Gift Subs in the channel!
[0:06:37] <+snausages_> it's the way some ppl get precious about the msq in xiv and make it out like everything is critical to appreciating it, ignoring the fact that people come to xiv for very different and valid reasons
[0:06:45] <%Lion_kun> The 3H lp was great because it was such a bumble
[0:06:54] <EvolNom> Oh noes how dare you not magically read their minds and stream to their will… idiots
[0:06:57] <DatAsuna> from yesterday
[0:06:57] <%kyh9> Guild Wars 2 can suck my dick
[0:07:00] <%Skullgod> hey woolie wassup
[0:07:00] <+matter8820> what happened yesterday? someone fill me in
[0:07:01] <tomdwarf> I dont hate you for not being interested, its cool.
[0:07:07] <%Arancet> @nosubstancex Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:07:09] <leith_aziz> When did Woolie strem 3H? I didnt know
[0:07:09] <Lancaster_H> GW2 was so disappointing man
[0:07:13] <%nosubstancex> Yw!
[0:07:16] <%czeekytv> I mean, refusing to interact with a piece of lore-relevant media (all the Taro writing) the way it was written because of pre-conceived notions of the wrapping it came in (an MMO) is pretty... not great IMO
[0:07:35] <DatAsuna> it can be done well
[0:07:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:42] <$thomassolorio> did you see that yasuke anime yet it's dumb but horrible
[0:07:45] <DatAsuna> but not every studio does
[0:07:48] <dds333a> @czeekytv sounds about right
[0:07:50] <+skyheys> @czeekytv Yeah, it's more than "dont be mean to thing" oh well.
[0:08:03] <%kyh9> @DatAsuna I think GW2's biggest issue early on is that their cash-shop had nothing in it. They wanted to raise money through it but gave NOTHING fun to buy through it
[0:08:06] <Pnutz409> Anyone pick up zion williamson shoes?
[0:08:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> @czeekytv to be fair, the writing for the dwarves in the beginning is very un-Yoko Taro, so how would anyone know?
[0:08:08] <laguerrilha> At least Yasuke finally gets a show
[0:08:10] <+Mortyboro> So is Telltale making a come back?
[0:08:21] <%czeekytv> @SveriSageAdvice totally agree. if only people had warned him beforehand lol
[0:08:33] <%Skullgod> Woolie sucks imo
[0:08:38] <dds333a> once he actually got to the Nier Jebaited
[0:08:40] <DatAsuna> @kyh9 yeah that's kind of the pitfall of that model and resource allocation
[0:08:40] <@Solidus_113> It's a fun dance you learn
[0:08:42] <leith_aziz> I cant really talk about that much cause I never played an MMO. But interacting with a big community seems cool
[0:08:51] <%czeekytv> But as long as had had fun that's what matters at the end of the day, today is a new one
[0:09:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @leith_aziz it isnt
[0:09:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Skullgod psaSmug
[0:09:11] <leith_aziz> Woolie, you had fun, dont think about how you achieved that
[0:09:14] <+D00msDayDan> at the end of the day
[0:09:16] <dmtjinni> dont explain it
[0:09:19] <dds333a> RETREAD
[0:09:24] <amused_platypus> woolie just use LB3
[0:09:26] <leith_aziz> If you wanna move on, do it.
[0:09:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Smells like ad
[0:09:36] <Lancaster_H> make a hype face for the thumbnail you coward
[0:09:42] <tomdwarf> Woolie. Its cool, ignore the haters. Nobody can force you to like something. Best we can do is present the stuff in the best light. If it doesnt grab ya, then it doesnt.
[0:09:44] <DatAsuna> learn your ghostrun rotation
[0:09:48] <+skyheys> @sverisageadvice I mean Replicant starts on 3 hours of baiting the audience and D1 full on ruses your ass
[0:09:57] <%thetunnelhomer> Saw the Robot, and clapped is fine really.
[0:10:00] <%nosubstancex> As someone 2500 hours into FinalFantasy 14 you have the right to your own opinion. Final Fantasy 14 Reddit also seems very toxic in comparison to the game itself.
[0:10:03] <@Solidus_113> "wow cool robot"
[0:10:09] <tomdwarf> I would love the Naruto bored face for the thumbnail, personally.
[0:10:09] <+snausages_> I dont actually get why people think the dorf stuff is so critical tbh
[0:10:13] <MagicalBiscuit> people have been mad at how you enjoy things for years it seems. I appreciate you woolie!
[0:10:13] <+skyheys> I mean that's true. its not a bad thing.
[0:10:18] <leith_aziz> @nosubstancex Any reddit is toxic most of the time
[0:10:21] <Equirah> That's the whole point of the cross-over LUL
[0:10:28] <DatAsuna> i do think chat today is also OVER correcting on positive.
[0:10:29] <%nosubstancex> Yeah I don't do reddit most the time haha
[0:10:29] <%kyh9> @DatAsuna Yeah. It just always struck me weird that it took SO LONG for the Gem Shop to get any half decent cosmetic armor or weapon skins or ANYTHING. GW2 had my favorite combat system from any MMO and it just makes me sad to see how ANet botched it with post-launch
[0:10:32] <+NYCrownlessKing> i expected u to shit on it woolie and I know you like nier go brrr, cool. think point blank ppl just wanted u to take pats warning or I think minh probably should of just focused on what you only wanted to see lol @woolieversus
[0:10:37] <Equirah> cause every FF XIV immediately went to play all of Taro's games LUL
[0:10:39] <%KiwamiKiryu> It's fine Woolie
[0:10:46] <+NYCrownlessKing> your cool just dont worry lol
[0:10:48] <%KiwamiKiryu> I don't get it either
[0:10:48] <DatAsuna> it wasn't unwatchable but there were fair complaints
[0:10:49] <+robo_trunk> Woolie's in his 30s. Changing is a younger man's game
[0:10:54] <leith_aziz> This kinda reminds me og how Max tackled The Witcher 3. It made me sad, but im not gonna nag the guy about it
[0:10:57] <leith_aziz> *of
[0:11:05] <KaiserMario> Stop being so defensive Woolie, you're allowed to not care about stuff LUL
[0:11:06] <%kyh9> Ojo sama
[0:11:07] <DatAsuna> just chill in the middle instead of extremes
[0:11:08] <@Solidus_113> Ojou
[0:11:09] <%illtima> Ohoho all the way
[0:11:09] <%kyh9> Give me that Hime Cut
[0:11:10] <DaKnightWarrior> Hohohoho
[0:11:17] <DatAsuna> i think minh prefers ojou
[0:11:19] <pxlpushr91> Reddit gonna reddit, and YT comments gonna splash in the mud. Shrug lol
[0:11:21] <%KiwamiKiryu> Dio's hoho
[0:11:25] <Lancaster_H> in this house we stan Karin
[0:11:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ARA ARA GANG
[0:11:28] <%kyh9> I've dated Ara-Ara types, they are not that fun to be around
[0:11:33] <Darren716> Pick one or fuck off Woolie
[0:11:36] <+D00msDayDan> Pick one coward
[0:11:40] <%Lion_kun> Relena FTW
[0:11:41] <Darren716> Kappa
[0:11:42] <amused_platypus> I prefer Ora Ora types
[0:11:43] <Equirah> Ohohoho without the Ojousama
[0:11:43] <%czeekytv> pick a side or fuck off
[0:11:44] <+skyheys> @kaisermario Yeah, I doubt people even care that he's disinterested. I think it was more the hostility at that material.
[0:11:44] <%kyh9> Ojou types are more interesting to talk to irl
[0:11:45] <%czeekytv> Kappa
[0:11:53] <MagicalBiscuit> based
[0:11:55] <leith_aziz> What is "Ojou"?
[0:11:56] <%kyh9> @Equirah Santa Claus?
[0:11:58] <@Menitta> ara ara
[0:12:05] <+MTLxSpider> ara Ara i sleep. hi honey. WOKE
[0:12:07] <%Skullgod> moon2PREGARIO
[0:12:11] <%Lion_kun> HOOOOO YOU APPROACH ME
[0:12:15] <AsinPersuasion> have a good one mr woolz
[0:12:17] <%KiwamiKiryu> "Pick one or fuck off "
[0:12:18] <+NYCrownlessKing> but he's the Jerry of the river @leith_aziz
[0:12:22] <joebeilieves> Damn y’all are savages towards wools 😂
[0:12:33] <Equirah> @leith_aziz "little lady" - usually the daughter of an established family
[0:12:36] <+bluedude153> is this dwarf stream
[0:12:42] <leith_aziz> @Lion_kun: "I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer."
[0:12:44] <Ashenik1> I am watching Disco Elysium and I started to wander:is Woolie's community mostly socialitss? Where are my neo libs boyz ?
[0:12:49] <Lancaster_H> @bluedude153 no that's patstaresat
[0:12:56] <%Seancicle> 👋🏻
[0:12:59] <+skyheys> @bluedude153 big dwarf gathering, much rabble
[0:13:02] <+D00msDayDan> @joebeilieves the people saying pick one or fuck off are referencing disco elysium shorting on him for being centrist
[0:13:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I was interested in that game until I realised its a PS5 exclusive
[0:13:26] <+bluedude153> lore important dwarf stream
[0:13:40] <dmtjinni> @BallerSwagBro9k returnal?
[0:13:50] <Equirah> @D00msDayDan just because something can be justified doesn't make it right
[0:13:55] <@Menitta> I have a PC in the cart. I need to learn more about the timing of when I can get my build
[0:13:56] <%KiwamiKiryu> @ballerswagbro9k same but specifically because it cost 70 dollars and Sony can fuck off in not buying any game at 70 dollars
[0:13:58] <+snausages_> do they have 3080s?
[0:14:03] <$gfkxj> Cheer500 Did you see the Ultrakill update? Have you been spoiled on what was added?
[0:14:07] <KaiserMario> @skyheys But the hostility was what was fun about it LUL
[0:14:18] <%kyh9> Just do it

[0:15:01] <Chaossheep> if it smells bad don't eat it
[0:15:01] <+snausages_> what doesnt kill u makes u stronger, or shit a lot

[0:15:07] <+D00msDayDan> I can’t wait for Woolie to play this with a controller and be bad at it and fervently defend his choice to use a controller
[0:15:07] <Darren716> Reggie what do you think about lore dwarfs?
[0:15:08] <%gatorafan> This used to be a FFXIV channel FeelsBadMan
[0:15:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> if its only a few days like 3 or 4, it should be fine?

[0:35:00] <dds333a> Not bad, on the first guy, anyway
[0:35:00] <+b_aleph> Is this the tutorial?
[0:35:02] <+nemtehe> nice
[0:35:03] <%nicversus> he's beginning to believe
[0:35:06] <thedudeinthered> Once the instincts and muscle memory kick in, this game is a blast
[0:35:08] <@Menitta> yeah no the game is real hard
[0:35:09] <%badfleshboy> Try holding the dodge longer
[0:35:19] <dds333a> @leith_azizalthough, he HAS played the game before,
[0:35:19] <@Menitta> the only thing forgiving in this game is the checkpoints
[0:35:26] <dds333a> But he's just rusty
[0:35:27] <%Jaxnos> confidence shall be the fall of man
[0:35:28] <+Mendin> Stay Humbus

[0:35:57] <%aram909> "they seem to be shooting at regular intervals" famous last words once the machinegunner shows up
[0:35:58] <%nicversus> hey that's the name of the videogame!!!
[0:35:59] <+Mendin> In the words of the great Korone: "Have confidence! *dies* ...No confidence!"
[0:36:17] <+b_aleph> ghostrunnin ain't easy
[0:36:21] <dds333a> Nice on that deflect, at the very least
[0:36:23] <Jayzens> checkpoints are instant, which is great for a game like this
[0:36:33] <dukenux> maybe because of the soundtrack but it looks like there's rhytm element to this
[0:36:34] <+Mendin> Ooh we're getting some DI action now with the side air dashing
[0:36:41] <%badfleshboy> Beating this on PlayStation gave me the worst hand cramps
[0:36:44] <+nemtehe> LESS GO
[0:37:00] <smallboops> this environment makes no sense haha
[0:37:00] <dds333a> @dukenux there really isn't, but some areas will feel like it
[0:37:03] <%Skullgod> what's his control scheme now
[0:37:07] <fancypanzer> the off camera kills are actually kind of impressive
[0:37:11] <dukenux> Save me mr. Ghost Runner
[0:37:28] <%nicversus> Mr Ghost Runner is my dad's name hahaha
[0:37:48] <%Jaxnos> so dodge can be dash?
[0:37:51] <%Wakiza97> Wakiza97 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[0:37:56] <+b_aleph> Somebody saaaaaave meee
[0:38:04] <+storkeylope> Yo so Mr. Ghostrunner is using his offhand??
[0:38:07] <leith_aziz> Seems like there's no double jump? That makes things akward
[0:38:12] <dukenux> wawo
[0:38:19] <dds333a> Oh boy
[0:38:20] <dukenux> almost made it somehow
[0:38:21] <%nicversus> the checkpoints could stand to be more frequent during the platforming bits tbh
[0:38:22] <%Arancet> @Jaxnos you hold to slow time and side dodge and let go to dash where youre aiming
[0:38:30] <+deadoberon> feels almost like it's optimized for mouse
[0:38:41] <dds333a> LUL
[0:38:47] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you have an airdash woolie

[0:38:57] <dds333a> New human
[0:38:58] <%Jaxnos> ah neat, thanks @Arancet
[0:39:09] <leith_aziz> LETS GO
[0:39:10] <+nemtehe> this game is hard, even harder on controller
[0:39:11] <%badfleshboy> It feels so good to watch someone else fail as much as I did playing this
[0:39:28] <+Despera__> This game looks like it has a bad acceleration curve on controller
[0:39:29] <DapperCadavr> omg first wooly stream :0 hyped to be here
[0:39:43] <thedudeinthered> Early stages are easy once you’re used to the simple version of the controls. It’s when the game keeps adding mechanics that it become really tough.
[0:39:51] <dukenux> I played through Mirror's Edge on keyboard. i tied jump/slide to mouse buttons
[0:39:53] <Jayzens> I guess because I don't play PC, I didn't have a bad time with the controller on the PS4
[0:40:06] <dukenux> ofc combat wasn't a big element there
[0:40:08] <Asuterisuku> Woolie moving much more smoothly than he was on PS5.
[0:40:14] <+Jiggisnipe> welcome to Cyber Montreal Kappa
[0:40:16] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Mihn was killed for being a part of the rebel forces sadge
[0:40:26] <dds333a> I think he was on PS4
[0:40:27] <Jayzens> but this game is definitely ment to be play with a mouse and keyboard
[0:40:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:40:33] <ZizerX> LUL
[0:40:39] <DaKnightWarrior> @dappercadavr Welcome lytCIAO
[0:40:50] <dukenux> God, but when you get better at this it start looking so good
[0:40:59] <Asuterisuku> @Jayzens The game on PC has BETTER controller sensitivity options than the Playstation version.
[0:41:09] <WG101> GOD
[0:41:13] <dds333a> @dukenux SO GOOD KevinTurtle
[0:41:14] <dukenux> HAX
[0:41:14] <+Cuon_Alpinus> yeah this game jank LUL
[0:41:17] <leith_aziz> Whiff punish
[0:41:30] <Asuterisuku> So yes while mouse and keyboard is the intended experience, controllers still work better on PC than on console.
[0:41:35] <fancypanzer> airdash is cool but have you heard of the Panic Dash
[0:41:37] <+nemtehe> really janky
[0:41:47] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you only get slowdown when airborne dashing
[0:41:47] <%aram909> @Cuon_Alpinus it only seems that way because its woolie playing
[0:41:50] <dds333a> Woolz is just bad right now, ideally, he'll get better
[0:41:51] <%Jaxnos> it feels like the camera sensitivity for a stick is TOO high now, but i ain't never played it
[0:42:16] <%aram909> the controls are v smooth and consistent
[0:42:18] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @Cuon_Alpinus trust me dude, I love this game and have beaten it a few times, but it is def jank
[0:42:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah it's kinda janky too, ESPECIALLY the last part
[0:42:25] <%johnny_gogo> gotta aim while slowing down
[0:42:29] <%aram909> theres some jank in the end o the game
[0:42:41] <%aram909> the demo was actually way way way jankier and was actually horrible
[0:42:44] <%aram909> and turned me off
[0:42:51] <+Cuon_Alpinus> the jank is aprt of the charm tho. can't have a freedom of movement game w/o jank
[0:42:55] <%aram909> the final release feels so so so much better to control

[0:43:21] <%Jaxnos> every time.
[0:43:28] <Asuterisuku> It looks like there's another route that's less exposed.
[0:43:46] <@Menitta> yeah honestly this is part of the ghostrunner experience
[0:43:49] <%Javaa01> You have to hit the projectile out of the air, and aim it at whoever you want it to hit
[0:44:06] <%Javaa01> Aka, have a mouse
[0:44:07] <Jayzens> take your time, but don't take your time.
[0:44:13] <dukenux> this feels like first person hotline miami

[0:44:33] <%Skullgod> have you tried dodging woolie
[0:44:41] <%aram909> first person hotline miami + mirrors edge
[0:44:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> good parry
[0:44:52] <+badjab326> this game is a lot easier if you play stuff like Apex/Titanfall often lol
[0:44:55] <%SirGO0SE> I tried to recreate that super meat boy death effect for a game and it was kinda tough
[0:44:55] <dukenux> Hotline Mirror's Edge
[0:45:02] <joyfulbastion> Just to be clear he's not on a timer is he?
[0:45:05] <+Cuon_Alpinus> no
[0:45:07] <%aram909> no timer
[0:45:19] <Josef_Stryker> For someone who loves games with parkour, he certainly plays like someone who's never played them Kappa
[0:45:23] <+Cuon_Alpinus> the only timer is the city curfew
[0:45:25] <%Javaa01> All projectiles can be parried, but your parry has a cooldown, so you can't parry multiple shots in a quick succession
[0:45:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> early
[0:45:30] <NewbiePov> we're all on a limited timer Kappa
[0:45:31] <%aram909> woolie you can serpentine
[0:45:34] <%Skullgod> if only woolie had practice playing titanfall 2 on the ps4 with the community like he promised
[0:45:37] <dukenux> maybe there are timed challenge if you feel particularly masochistic
[0:45:38] <%aram909> strafe the bullets
[0:45:48] <+Jiggisnipe> become like Might Guy PogChamp
[0:45:50] <%thotbane> Katana Zero 2's looking ambitious
[0:46:05] <Josef_Stryker> @Skullgod That reminds me that apparently May 1 is some Titanfall 2 event the community's doinh
[0:46:08] <Josef_Stryker> *doing
[0:46:09] <%Javaa01> Not at close range
[0:46:19] <%johnny_gogo> You can totally strafe them
[0:46:22] <Josef_Stryker> I guess I'll log in that day
[0:46:47] <Naleb> first person view of the blade movie?
[0:46:59] <+Cuon_Alpinus> You can control exactly how far you want to side dash with the air slowmo
[0:47:19] <@Menitta> theres a learning curve
[0:47:19] <dukenux> We need to bring Blade back as a guest character in video games
[0:47:37] <%aram909> @dukenux any game or a marvel game? hes in ultimate alliance 3

[0:52:31] <%Javaa01> No, the parry is reflecting the shot back
[0:52:33] <Asuterisuku> It's just hard.
[0:52:38] <dds333a> @dmtjinni it's actually difficult
[0:52:39] <BlackermanZX> for a guy called ghostrunner he sure stumbles a lot
[0:52:45] <%johnny_gogo> Now i gets real
[0:52:53] <@Menitta> No, the parry isn't reflecting the bullet yet. There's an upgrade that does do that
[0:52:54] <+Cuon_Alpinus> parry reflection is unlocked later
[0:52:58] <dds333a> It's also Anti-Woolz because it's an FPS LUL
[0:53:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Turning camera down while up in the air effs you up when you land, keeping camera verticly stable is the way to go
[0:53:17] <dds333a> But he's rusty about now
[0:53:25] <BlackermanZX> sick block tho
[0:53:29] <%johnny_gogo> good shit
[0:53:34] <Johannen> Melee does not parry but destorys bullets right now
[0:53:34] <Asuterisuku> All of Doom's story DLC is out now. Woolie vs. TAG when?
[0:53:35] <+matter8820> woolie making the schizo camera work
[0:53:37] <+Cuon_Alpinus> this is a significant improvement
[0:53:45] <%Javaa01> And there we go, Woolie made it to the end of the demo
[0:53:47] <dds333a> Alright, jump tutorials
[0:53:52] <dmtjinni> @dds333a exactly what I thought and the hyper speed nature of the game just oof
[0:53:53] <%Javaa01> Now for the rest of the game
[0:53:53] <Nightwingie> doing well kmaHypers
[0:54:00] <dukenux> Zordon?
[0:54:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Braniac?
[0:54:10] <+paladinstarbuster> bad touch
[0:54:12] <Asuterisuku> That segment is anti-bitrate
[0:54:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Cephalon Suda?
[0:54:22] <+matter8820> this game runs very well on my old build also. I was very impressed
[0:54:51] <keankong85> agent 47 but backwards
[0:54:57] <WG101> gain upgrades within the slowed time
[0:55:02] <BlackermanZX> who needs bitrate anyways
[0:55:04] <%nicversus> bitrate still mangled tho
[0:55:10] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa we read the secret chapter
[0:55:13] <%Lion_kun> LOST EPISODE
[0:55:13] <+Cuon_Alpinus> I watched the manga being destroyed live onstream LUL
[0:55:15] <Exillion_44> is the number 74 dependent on deaths or is it a fixed story number?
[0:55:24] <@Menitta> Ghost Runner? More like, Phantom Sprinter
[0:55:26] <spiderously> sex toys?
[0:55:27] <Asuterisuku> I did read that manga. I'd imagine it looks better on the TV, but it's getting SUPER bitcrushed on this version because there's so many more particle effects going on.
[0:55:27] <+matter8820> does the game have deadzone settings?
[0:55:32] <BlackermanZX> woolie vs ghostrunner volume 0
[0:55:32] <%nicversus> why would you try to stop The Coup that band rules
[0:55:44] <%Jaxnos> yes
[0:55:46] <+blastyoboots> Oh yeah ONE PUNCH MAN
[0:55:47] <Asuterisuku> Naruto was that.
[0:55:48] <%nicversus> We got the guillotine, you better run
[0:55:49] <%Lion_kun> Shaman King
[0:55:49] <dukenux> Director's Cut Manga
[0:55:51] <+paladinstarbuster> sword art had that a bit
[0:55:53] <+FuqBoiSlim> Didn't that happen with Tokyo Ghoul?
[0:55:57] <@Solidus_113> yeah One Punch Man
[0:56:00] <BlackermanZX> isn't yugi oh something like that
[0:56:08] <Johannen> @blastyoboots Manga did not change due to anime
[0:56:13] <dukenux> Didn't OPM start as a webcomic?
[0:56:17] <@Solidus_113> yep
[0:56:31] <stanlychicken> The opm webcomic is going on tho
[0:56:35] <brunoberserk> jujutsu kaisen kinda , the oneshot is kinda different
[0:56:39] <Johannen> OPM webcomic and manga are different Cannons
[0:56:44] <+blastyoboots> One Punch Man is probably the most dramatic example because it was re-artisted by a different artist, before the anime
[0:56:48] <BlackermanZX> ohh like OPM
[0:56:52] <+blastyoboots> and is STILL being re-arted
[0:57:05] <%Necnill> FFXV storyline coming in clutch
[0:57:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[0:57:07] <Asuterisuku> Maximum was more of a sequel than a rewrite, wasn't it?
[0:57:12] <%SirGO0SE> re-arted sounds funny
[0:57:13] <+MythFolk> didn't that happen with dot hack? or am I misremembering
[0:57:27] <+blastyoboots> the mangaka of Eyeshield 21 redid the art for him and made it the MOST EXTRA THING EVER
[0:57:48] <WG101> ghostrunner re:boot
[0:57:48] <DaKnightWarrior> yusuke murata's are is godly
[0:57:56] <DaKnightWarrior> *art
[0:57:59] <bbrostik> Yo Woolie how you doing man?
[0:58:00] <dukenux> Ghostrunner: Reforged Kappa
[0:58:00] <BlackermanZX> Murata is just built different
[0:58:03] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Webcomic and Manga have different canon and "follow thier own way" parralel works
[0:58:09] <Jaysky> The webcomic is still going for OPM
[0:58:12] <dds333a> Monogatari also got re-adapted as a manga
[0:58:13] <+badjab326> this song is a fuckin banger
[0:58:18] <%nicversus> murata happened to one punch man and it became what it is today
[0:58:20] <Asuterisuku> I read Trigun so long ago that I can't remember a thing that happened in it. I need to fix that.
[0:58:26] <420mangojuice> incompetent repairs Kekw
[0:58:35] <+RoboBro1212> they goofed
[0:58:48] <rosemon5001> oppose the dick demon? THE HEADENS
[0:58:49] <dukenux> I'm honestly surprised they gave a voice to mr. Runner
[0:58:53] <Asuterisuku> Holy shit this area is so much more BUSY on PC.
[0:58:58] <dukenux> i thought he was a complete silent protag
[0:59:13] <dukenux> like the Ruiner guy
[0:59:32] <BlackermanZX> SMT Mara? woolieMIRIN
[0:59:36] <nicversus> ain't no harm in a bionic arm
[0:59:40] <+RoboBro1212> Dawngate Marah KomodoHype
[0:59:43] <+Mrbaconator> only if the bionic arm is your wife
[0:59:49] <dukenux> Mara! Taken my arm, taken my life
[0:59:50] <DaKnightWarrior> Bionic...AAAAARM!
[0:59:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> Twitch doesn't like all this visual noise lol. Compression is trying it's best
[0:59:51] <dds333a> Hindu Mara Kappa
[0:59:59] <Naleb> Désolé du francais, sa se passe bien de votre côté depuis le debut de la pandémie?
[1:00:00] <%Jaxnos> one shots in general are this idea but at a smaller scale. Like Gintama and Naruto.
[1:00:02] <dukenux> Doc Ock?
[1:00:06] <Johannen> Cant wait till Woolie gets to Tetris part of Ghostrunner
[1:00:19] <%Jaxnos> naruto one shot was a kid who could turn into a fox
[1:00:37] <%nicversus> (source: dude trust me!)
[1:00:38] <+RoboBro1212> vargNut
[1:00:41] <dukenux> Tetrispunk
[1:00:45] <+blastyoboots> VFS - Visual F%&ing Sex
[1:00:47] <BlackermanZX> also its bitrate death
[1:00:50] <+paladinstarbuster> anti bitrate
[1:00:56] <dukenux> Bitratecore
[1:00:56] <$JobbedBone> this looks like the fake video games from the crime dramas
[1:01:02] <%nicversus> it makes me want a new MGS VR Missions
[1:01:08] <+blastyoboots> @JobbedBone <-- THIS
[1:01:20] <gamewarden92> What's that pyramid tho?
[1:01:21] <@Menitta> An average fighter but a BRILLIANT SCIENTIST
[1:01:31] <%Mathochism> IT'S ALL JUST TRON
[1:01:38] <Asuterisuku> Only 24 deaths!
[1:02:08] <%Javaa01> Perk Tetris
[1:02:10] <dukenux> here we go
[1:02:28] <Johannen> Briefcase Tetris Literally
[1:02:34] <dukenux> TRONcore/punk it is
[1:02:34] <@Menitta> the upgrade system is neat
[1:02:41] <%aram909> TRONcore is good
[1:02:42] <WG101> PUZZLEBOIS IS BACK BAYBEEE
[1:02:44] <$JobbedBone> megaman BATTLE NETWORK?!
[1:02:46] <+blastyoboots> HOLY SHIT YES I FUCKING **LOVE** Upgrade Tetris
[1:02:47] <BlackermanZX> Oh shit
[1:02:50] <BlackermanZX> Its battle network
[1:02:51] <+paladinstarbuster> MMBN
[1:02:55] <%Mathochism> Troncore is exactly what we should call it.
[1:02:56] <%aram909> ATTACHE CASE THE GAME
[1:02:57] <DaKnightWarrior> Puzzle...
[1:02:59] <%nicversus> Mega Man Battle Network has entered the chat
[1:03:02] <DaKnightWarrior> bois...
[1:03:04] <+RoboBro1212> speaking of Dawngate holy shit, really similar upgrade system
[1:03:05] <dukenux> imagine there are people who hate inventory tetris
[1:03:06] <WG101> PUZZLE
[1:03:07] <WG101> BOIS
[1:03:16] <%Javaa01> Remember though, you don't have to max out the grid
[1:03:23] <Asuterisuku> The yellow ones are Tetriminos
[1:03:26] <+blastyoboots> THIS is what's missing from One Step From Eden
[1:03:27] <+paladinstarbuster> Megaman battle network lp when?
[1:03:41] <dukenux> >aiming required. "bye"
[1:03:44] <%nicversus> I would call it Gridcore. The original Tron is so fucking hammy. Any surviving coolness of it is like... accidental at this point, or at least owing to Syd Mead
[1:03:45] <@Solidus_113> the outline is really good
[1:03:45] <%aram909> REFLECT
[1:03:46] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Detector will let you find more lore and customization
[1:03:54] <+RoboBro1212> lotta locked out squares
[1:03:55] <Asuterisuku> Only the bottom left are powered right now.
[1:04:03] <+blastyoboots> @Johannen <--
[1:04:08] <%Javaa01> The electricity tiles are the ones you have available
[1:04:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:04:22] <rosemon5001> only other game i know that has done this is a kingdom hearts game 358/2 days
[1:04:28] <%psydaku> Use the compression commands
[1:04:40] <dukenux> not much to play with for now
[1:04:46] <+blastyoboots> Collectors!!!!
[1:04:49] <@Solidus_113> outline is REALLY nice
[1:04:50] <+blastyoboots> Collectables**
[1:04:50] <BlackermanZX> its pretty much Battle Network's NaviCust LUL
[1:04:52] <%Javaa01> The reflection is really nice, if you have a mouse, with a controller, just leave it be
[1:04:56] <@Solidus_113> the items are collectables
[1:05:06] <%johnny_gogo> items are cosmetic too
[1:05:07] <%psydaku> @BlackermanZX exactly
[1:05:09] <Johannen> Items are not "just" collectibles
[1:05:21] <+blastyoboots> @johnny_gogo Cosmetics?!?! PogChamp
[1:05:37] <$JobbedBone> this looks fuuunnn
[1:05:41] <+blastyoboots> this game is SO cool
[1:05:42] <Asuterisuku> This is where Woolie was having trouble on console.
[1:05:45] <+RoboBro1212> schmoooooovin
[1:05:52] <%nicversus> this is where the last attempt fell apart
[1:05:56] <AncelDeLambert> this game gets.... less cool, over time
[1:05:59] <dukenux> ME muscle memory coming back
[1:06:07] <%johnny_gogo> @blastyoboots different swords swords
[1:06:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> This looks a million times easier than the last time you played
[1:06:26] <+RoboBro1212> this feels super not designed for controller
[1:06:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> What was going ON with the console version
[1:06:29] <%Javaa01> On the ground
[1:06:30] <AncelDeLambert> oh, Woolie is on keyboard?
[1:06:32] <spiderously> not 8m the air
[1:06:32] <%Javaa01> Not in the air
[1:06:39] <Asuterisuku> I think he's using an Xbox pad.
[1:06:50] <+paladinstarbuster> Who here ran that titan fall 2 training course till they got number one on the leaderboard?
[1:07:00] <Parapattern> Woolie 'Two Dash' Madden
[1:07:02] <Johannen> Is Woolie using Bumper Jumper?
[1:07:09] <+paladinstarbuster> felt like a god after
[1:07:14] <%radregice> no no no you can use both in the air, its for the dashes, not bullet time
[1:07:16] <dds333a> Ay , he's doing it
[1:07:17] <Asuterisuku> It looks like it feels better.
[1:07:34] <$JobbedBone> remember I-Ninja?
[1:07:42] <AncelDeLambert> man it's dumb that bullet time is only midair
[1:07:51] <AncelDeLambert> that screwed me up so much when I started playing
[1:07:59] <+Cuon_Alpinus> alright the real test begins LUL
[1:08:06] <AncelDeLambert> oh no. This level
[1:08:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> Was it a framerate issue or something? Or did it just control like garbage on console for some reason
[1:08:29] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @ReallyBigRocks the controller support on console is really bad for no reason
[1:08:38] <%nicversus> I guess this place just doesn't have music, because there was no music in the last playthrough too
[1:08:40] <spiderously> he seems real trustworthy
[1:08:42] <Johannen> It prob was realy chopy
[1:08:43] <%johnny_gogo> No music?
[1:08:53] <gamewarden92> asshole ex-CEO
[1:08:54] <Parapattern> Red flag
[1:08:56] <Asuterisuku> This is where they gave up.
[1:08:57] <Johannen> No music is correct
[1:08:59] <%radregice> music comes in after this section
[1:09:22] <@Solidus_113> low DPI and high sensitivity causes pixel skipping, that's what it likely was
[1:09:53] <Asuterisuku> The console version treated the mouse as tilting the stick and the deadzone was enormous.
[1:10:26] <Johannen> This part is not 100% smooth, i had same trouble on PC with both Gamepad and Mouse
[1:10:32] <%Javaa01> Yeah, it's taking directinput commands and translating them to mouse movement most likely
[1:10:37] <+Cuon_Alpinus> all the items are collectibles
[1:10:47] <+Cuon_Alpinus> but you can get cool skins for your sword
[1:10:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> I get why mouse control on console was bad, that's just how M+K is on console but Woolie was having issues with a controller too
[1:10:55] <Retinolgaming> I just got a pain reliever drug gamer themed ad on twitch LUL
[1:10:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> So weird
[1:11:07] <Asuterisuku> Think you can get up there with a dash?
[1:11:17] <%Javaa01> You can just walk back
[1:11:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:11:46] <Asuterisuku> In the first battle
[1:11:50] <%Javaa01> It's either lore items, or sword skins
[1:11:57] <+blastyoboots> "THE PLAN"
[1:12:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> WEAK
[1:12:03] <Asuterisuku> At least it's not an Arkham situation.
[1:12:05] <AncelDeLambert> here iz de playn, we steal de mun
[1:12:11] <$JobbedBone> D: 40 YEARS
[1:12:11] <+RoboBro1212> IN THE FIRST AGE
[1:12:15] <%johnny_gogo> can you look at the armory
[1:12:31] <Asuterisuku> When the shadows first lengthened
[1:12:38] <%johnny_gogo> F sorry
[1:12:39] <+blastyoboots> holy crap this audiolog is *lore sex*
[1:12:39] <%Javaa01> Yeah there's a reason there's only 7 of these
[1:12:45] <%aram909> yeah turns out ADAM/the architect is kinda sus and uh may be as bad as Mara
[1:12:49] <+RoboBro1212> "Adam" like he's not the architect come the fuck on game
[1:12:50] <WG101> what about greg town? how's that doing?
[1:12:54] <@Menitta> I love how you can hear him open a bottle of something
[1:12:56] <+blastyoboots> this is saaaatisfying writing~<3
[1:12:56] <Asuterisuku> Adam sounds like someone you know.
[1:12:57] <+RoboBro1212> even the name says it all
[1:12:59] <$JobbedBone> held hostage by the game BibleThump adhd hell
[1:13:16] <$emptyantics> Who made this game? It looks incredible
[1:13:18] <dukenux> Time mr. Runner?
[1:13:30] <thedudeinthered> It’s always fun so long as you get to look down from above...
[1:13:37] <Asuterisuku> Supergiant games good.
[1:13:41] <%nicversus> Transistor is my fucking life
[1:13:50] <Johannen> Woolie overhyping the game just for you to be dissapointed
[1:13:59] <+RoboBro1212> supergiant is the best
[1:14:00] <iacus_> eh
[1:14:02] <%aram909> @Johannen Nah, Transistor rocks
[1:14:09] <DaKnightWarrior> I will check it out.
[1:14:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait they added GLOVES now?
[1:14:15] <+blastyoboots> @Johannen Transistor is damn good if you're the type of person whose itches it scratches
[1:14:19] <$emptyantics> Tranistornis actually great
[1:14:25] <%Javaa01> The bulk of the gloves are DLC though
[1:14:25] <spiderously> nier is the same
[1:14:27] <dukenux> Transistor is really great, but people will now compare it to Hades
[1:14:38] <%johnny_gogo> theres a pc master race sword with rainbow rgb its the best
[1:14:51] <@Menitta> aw yeah the corsair sword
[1:14:52] <Asuterisuku> Done specifically so that you can keep your finger on the sticks at all times.
[1:14:59] <dukenux> In this?
[1:15:00] <+Despera__> I forget that I'm just crazy and most people don't play claw
[1:15:18] <$JobbedBone> yeah
[1:15:22] <Johannen> @blastyoboots Its not ZE Best thou
[1:15:38] <$JobbedBone> and the dash
[1:15:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Tank controls PogChamp
[1:15:59] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its not that AT ALL
[1:16:01] <@Solidus_113> what?
[1:16:06] <Asuterisuku> Wasn't the checkpoint closer before?
[1:16:21] <%johnny_gogo> nah i get what you mean
[1:16:22] <+Jiggisnipe> think he means in comparison to 3rd person games
[1:16:26] <Johannen> It has no difference
[1:16:36] <+paladinstarbuster> i understand woolie
[1:16:45] <@Solidus_113> that's not a universal case, mostly for games that have a mantle that matters
[1:16:46] <dukenux> it makes sense, but i dunno if its acutally a mechanic in hl
[1:16:53] <@Solidus_113> Doom for instance does have that
[1:17:01] <Asuterisuku> It's definitely going to move you further up when you're dashing into it.
[1:17:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> depends on the engine
[1:17:05] <%Javaa01> Different engines have vastly different movement mechanics
[1:17:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> source is... special
[1:17:17] <Asuterisuku> Source is great.
[1:17:19] <JinJun1738> I learned that from dying light
[1:17:30] <%Javaa01> And Source has the most engine level movement tech as far as relatively modern game engines go
[1:17:52] <Asuterisuku> There's a reason Respawn used Source for Titanfall instead of something more modern like Cryengine.
[1:17:53] <%johnny_gogo> you can wall run a basically anything
[1:17:53] <%Javaa01> Some of which is homebrew, some of which is inherited from old Quake era Idtech
[1:17:56] <JetpackMcQuack> First person platforming is goofy
[1:18:02] <$emptyantics> I hope Woolie plays Vermitide 2 one day
[1:18:11] <+RoboBro1212> deep rock galactic tho
[1:18:20] <+RoboBro1212> ROCK N STONE
[1:18:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:21] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You are pushing right when you jump off and drifting of course
[1:18:23] <Asuterisuku> The dash will go where you're looking, Woolie.
[1:18:24] <Nightwingie> sbfpDattebayo
[1:18:24] <%Javaa01> And yeah Cryengine definitely has it's own jank as well in regards to gravity
[1:18:33] <%andrewofbob> Source is based on Quake's engine, so a lot of emergent tech was already implied
[1:18:59] <Asuterisuku> Or rather where you're pointing the stick based on where you're looking.
[1:19:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus This part is totaly cursed, its not just you
[1:19:25] <%Javaa01> UE4 doesn't have a lot of inherent movement tech, but devs tend to program some in just to make movement more interesting
[1:19:41] <DapperCadavr> can you hold jump to get more momentum?
[1:19:50] <%aram909> this is literally the jankiest segment in the game
[1:19:55] <Johannen> ^^
[1:19:56] <%aram909> minus the final final area
[1:19:56] <%andrewofbob> Titanfall would at least lead your camera away from the wall; that seems to be missing here
[1:20:02] <dds333a> here we go again
[1:20:03] <%nicversus> you need to be looking more directly at the wall you intend to run along
[1:20:03] <%johnny_gogo> i hate how the walls are slanted so you lose height every jump
[1:20:07] <BlackermanZX> maybe you gotta look at each wall really fast
[1:20:07] <%Juriasu> can you not run in this game?
[1:20:15] <Asuterisuku> He IS running.
[1:20:20] <%Juriasu> what
[1:20:31] <Johannen> This is the only part of the game i had simmilar troubles as Woolie with walljumping
[1:20:32] <Asuterisuku> Game doesn't have a WALK.
[1:20:35] <%Juriasu> I thought this was a gotta go fast type of game
[1:20:45] <%nicversus> it's not called GhostWalker
[1:20:47] <BlackermanZX> almost got it
[1:20:50] <spiderously> this is sooo much easier with a mouse, still tricky, but easier
[1:20:53] <+Cuon_Alpinus> NotLikeThis
[1:20:54] <%aram909> you have to aim a little bit further into the wall
[1:20:56] <+nemtehe> game's janky
[1:20:58] <%aram909> but the angle is still kinda specific
[1:20:59] <%johnny_gogo> @Juriasu you cant run but there's momentum and inertia
[1:21:01] <@Menitta> yes
[1:21:07] <JetpackMcQuack> hit the wall better 4Head
[1:21:10] <%Javaa01> You need to look at the surface you want to run on, but it can't be a straight 90 degrees
[1:21:14] <IzanagiNoOokami> I'm tired of Ghostrunner give me Livewalker.
[1:21:17] <Asuterisuku> Every time he dashes while pointing the camera down I NotLikeThis
[1:21:18] <BlackermanZX> is this really running? it looks more like jogging StinkyGlitch
[1:21:33] <%Pillagius> Pillagius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Gotta Go Fast!
[1:21:35] <Johannen> Yeah, you cant facefuck the wall as if you are wallrunning
[1:21:42] <%aram909> you need to learn those rules to do the final area of the game because its literally nothing but these wall jumps
[1:21:46] <%Juriasu> GhostPowerwalker
[1:21:54] <laguerrilha> yay we back
[1:21:54] <+badjab326> Wheres the music?
[1:22:02] <@Menitta> this section has no music
[1:22:05] <%johnny_gogo> to go super fast slide jump dash
[1:22:08] <@Menitta> and its weird
[1:22:12] <$JobbedBone> it needs the angle to determine where to send you with the run?
[1:22:14] <Asuterisuku> Faith has her full moveset from the very beginning.
[1:22:22] <Nightwingie> the music is our thoughts fareehaFine
[1:22:23] <+Bajimxenn> is it hold a button to wall run or just tap?
[1:22:23] <dukenux> in the og game
[1:22:26] <Johannen> Slide into Jump then Dash for a boost
[1:22:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:22:36] <dukenux> in catalyst they lock moves

[1:22:57] <Asuterisuku> There should really be a checkpoint here.
[1:23:02] <%nicversus> we are now outside the Content Zone
[1:23:10] <%nicversus> the content light is off
[1:23:19] <%Juriasu> they didn't animate this part of the manga
[1:23:21] <dbag202> oh man
[1:23:26] <%andrewofbob> Maybe the ninja would wallrun better if he put his sword away LUL
[1:23:27] <skyentombment> wow, a good fps character action with wall running and machines, kinda reminds me of TITANFALL
[1:23:28] <spiderously> oh god! TOM is gonna be pure agony
[1:23:36] <$Spydurman> LUL
[1:23:44] <sirmousehatter> yeah, you kinda have to be able to do this if you want to be able to clear the game
[1:23:56] <%nicversus> lul
[1:23:57] <Johannen> Nah, this part is JANK
[1:23:58] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:23:59] <+badjab326> I don't remember this section being this tough lol
[1:24:02] <dukenux> frustration getting bigger
[1:24:02] <$Spydurman> His hope and optimism gone
[1:24:03] <+Bajimxenn> oh no....
[1:24:05] <Asuterisuku> It's not just you, Woolie.
[1:24:08] <haitakaa> it's fine, just think of it as practice
[1:24:14] <%DrFacilier> is it time for this NotLikeThis emote?
[1:24:14] <%nicversus> maybe this game sucks
[1:24:15] <Johannen> These platforms are like slightly off
[1:24:18] <Asuterisuku> He got here so much quicker than the first time, too.
[1:24:20] <Nightwingie> you got this
[1:24:23] <haitakaa> we're down to chill
[1:24:25] <bufflb> has he played ghostrunner before?
[1:24:27] <skyentombment> @nicversus no johns
[1:24:27] <El_Rabbit> This part was not that difficult with mouse and keyboard
[1:24:33] <%andrewofbob> Titanfall is at least forgiving in that you get an air jump to correct
[1:24:38] <dukenux> getting angry and starting to killing your character on purpose out of spite
[1:24:43] <%Juriasu> you can do it though Woolie, almost got it
[1:24:46] <%Javaa01> @Johannen The timing here is just very tight, but yeah those platforms in the final chapter are actually a bit off though
[1:24:52] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you're losing too much momentum
[1:24:53] <%nicversus> @skyentombment I'm just floating possibilities here
[1:25:00] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Keep camera movement to the minimum, it will make you face forward
[1:25:07] <bufflb> has he played ghostrunner before?
[1:25:21] <BlackermanZX> can you dash after each wall jump?
[1:25:21] <%nicversus> on playstation he has
[1:25:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[1:25:28] <JetpackMcQuack> No favors here
[1:25:29] <+storkeylope> Is it weirding anyone else out that there's no music?
[1:25:30] <+nemtehe> it's not you man, it's finicky af
[1:25:30] <+MTLxSpider> @bufflb has he played ghostrunner before?
[1:25:35] <%andrewofbob> There was a previous session, but that was on a worse hybrid control setup
[1:25:39] <$Spydurman> the walls are just far enough apart to new a dash occasionally cause a jump will get you like 80% of the way there and trick you into looking like it's fine
[1:25:55] <DapperCadavr> just watched a playthrough of this area. seems like the player was jumping to the edges of the signs instead of the middle
[1:25:56] <%jepupu> Turn more?
[1:26:00] <Nightwingie> close!
[1:26:01] <$Spydurman> dash
[1:26:06] <%johnny_gogo> gotta dedicate to the jump
[1:26:11] <$Spydurman> dash there
[1:26:15] <%Javaa01> You can dash if you fail, but you have to recognize the fuckup instantly
[1:26:21] <%Javaa01> Not a second after it happened
[1:26:23] <BlackermanZX> well try dashing then
[1:26:30] <JetpackMcQuack> I’ve played enough lucio to know good wall running
[1:26:37] <gamewarden92> Is the lack of music a design choice? Like, they knew there was no way to make this hype, so they just left it as a silent fuck-through.
[1:26:37] <sirmousehatter> this part is honestly no problem with keyboard and mouse. ghostrunner is just harder with a controller
[1:26:42] <%andrewofbob> And this isn't the Gabriel of Ghostrunner?
[1:26:49] <IzanagiNoOokami> Clink Clink Clink Clink - Whoosh - Oof
[1:26:50] <%nicversus> he's counting footsteps folks, we are at goblin defcon 1
[1:26:53] <@Solidus_113> you're not jumping off the wall at the end
[1:27:00] <%jepupu> Speed aiming with controller seems tough.
[1:27:06] <El_Rabbit> Just believe Woolie! I believe in you!
[1:27:08] <%Juriasu> It looks like if you dash too early or if the dah is too shallow you will drop too far before you hit that wall
[1:27:10] <Asuterisuku> Not jumping off the wall and pointing down.
[1:27:15] <%aram909> ok look this section is janky for sure but it definitely didnt take me this long and im definitely worse than woolie at this kind of stuff
[1:27:30] <%nicversus> Trust the fungus, woolie
[1:27:31] <haitakaa> dat angle
[1:27:31] <bufflb> try mouse and keyboard?
[1:27:32] <+blastyoboots> the lack of music in this part is absolutely dreadful
[1:27:34] <Johannen> @sirmousehatter I tested with both KB/M and Gamepad and had generaly no trouble until i unlocked more mehcanics, This part just not as smooth
[1:27:43] <%andrewofbob> FPS on controller is reliant on aim assist, and that would be SO GOOD with the platforming
[1:27:48] <BlackermanZX> oh yeah you are not jumping off the wall in one of these
[1:27:56] <%jepupu> Jump towards a closer section of the next wall?
[1:28:03] <skyentombment> trust the fungus amogus chungus
[1:28:09] <%johnny_gogo> believe in the Reggie that believes in you Woolie
[1:28:10] <Nightwingie> kabajiBless
[1:28:15] <%Javaa01> @andrewofbob If it was just platforming, but enemies get mixed in, and that's when it breaks
[1:28:16] <bufflb> amogus
[1:28:25] <%johnny_gogo> you can pull from there
[1:28:27] <+Cuon_Alpinus> he totally couldve grabbed the grapple there
[1:28:35] <bufflb> amorgos
[1:28:44] <$Spydurman> mods should run a poll on how many more attempts this will take
[1:28:56] <BlackermanZX> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:29:02] <+blastyoboots> @bufflb a mongoose?
[1:29:03] <JinJun1738> miirioPepeHands
[1:29:04] <%andrewofbob> 139
[1:29:08] <Nightwingie> you got this
[1:29:11] <Asuterisuku> He turns his camera in towards it.
[1:29:12] <skyentombment> 10 more tries
[1:29:25] <@Solidus_113> the corner of the screen is generally a good idea of when the wall has run out
[1:29:26] <+blastyoboots> does he need to strafe instead of looking at the wall?
[1:29:32] <%psydaku> 69 more tries Kappa
[1:29:33] <%johnny_gogo> you dont have to hard look at it to wall run im pretty sure
[1:29:36] <%Namillus> Does Ghostrunner have jump strength based on button input?
[1:29:41] <bufflb> this looks like it would be a lot easier with a mouse
[1:29:41] <Johannen> @blastyoboots Yeah
[1:29:55] <FicboyOG> @Namillus nope
[1:30:00] <spiderously> try facing forward
[1:30:03] <Nightwingie> kmaHands
[1:30:08] <%Javaa01> @bufflb It is, the whole game is more or less designed around WASD and a mouse
[1:30:12] <Asuterisuku> This is a mechanics check.
[1:30:19] <+Cuon_Alpinus> If you hop up onto the railing and use a jump dash upward, you can just climb on the bridge the whole way across
[1:30:20] <+blastyoboots> @WoolieVersus you might need to adjust your sensitivity settings, or even pull out mouse and keyboard JUST for this part
[1:30:23] <@Solidus_113> this is how you dodge bullets
[1:30:30] <1000_buffers> how does this control compare to mirror's edge? @WoolieVersus
[1:30:31] <%Pillagius> That's a lot of your game later on...
[1:30:38] <+violaj26> has he tried using the slowdown to better re-adjust between jumps?
[1:30:47] <%nicversus> Woolie is the waves crashing on the eternal shore of this section
[1:30:50] <haitakaa> I think this is the hardest part
[1:30:57] <%Juriasu> ooohh
[1:31:00] <haitakaa> I mean it's more freeform later
[1:31:02] <skyentombment> OH NO
[1:31:05] <Nightwingie> almost!
[1:31:15] <+QueequegTheater> First you have to talk to the dwarves
[1:31:15] <Johannen> @violaj26 Slowdown will not help cause it's still costing you time
[1:31:20] <%radregice> the game puts you in a really bad position to get started on those wallruns
[1:31:21] <%johnny_gogo> you gotta look a little
[1:31:22] <Asuterisuku> Probably not; you need to point the dash.
[1:31:25] <bufflb> mirrors edge is just a better game in general
[1:31:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> I was gonna say, are you able to get higher up on the walls?
[1:31:30] <$arcielardor> just got in, is Woolie getting the hang of it?
[1:31:38] <+MTLxSpider> almost
[1:31:42] <skyentombment> @arcielardor ehhhhh
[1:31:44] <+nemtehe> Exactly, Mirror's edge is smooth
[1:31:45] <1000_buffers> toggle god mode mokyChill
[1:31:45] <dukenux> yeah from the looks alone mirror's edge running seems more polished
[1:31:47] <+blastyoboots> and then on this dash for the last wall ahead of you
[1:31:53] <Johannen> Is Woolie pushing jump with a direction?
[1:31:54] <+blastyoboots> i think
[1:31:55] <+paladinstarbuster> he is?
[1:32:13] <1000_buffers> can he map jump to a button?
[1:32:17] <Asuterisuku> That time you had to turn the camera away from the wall; you were on it too directly.
[1:32:17] <%Javaa01> Mirror's Edge is a lot slower, and a lot more generous, there's very few cases of extended platforming over death pits, and when it is present, it's usually just "hop between these swing bars in a straight line to get to the next rooftop"
[1:32:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> That looked really good and then it just didn't work
[1:32:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:45] <+badjab326> somebody tell woolie to use a mouse
[1:32:46] <1000_buffers> do a 360 let the mt dew flow through you @WoolieVersus
[1:32:46] <$Spydurman> whoever guessed 10 more tries a while ago I think you've lost the bet
[1:32:49] <+wmeldrum> this game looks..... troublesome
[1:32:54] <%johnny_gogo> use the slow down as well to allow more time for adjustment
[1:32:57] <Nightwingie> I believe kabajiBless
[1:33:01] <+blastyoboots> If his controller has wings like a Steam controller, mapping jump to one of the wings would make this much easier
[1:33:03] <bufflb> woolie should play easier games
[1:33:05] <skyentombment> @Spydurman I admit defeat
[1:33:06] <%Javaa01> @wmeldrum Only on a controller
[1:33:12] <$Spydurman> this game really doesn't seem friendly to controller players
[1:33:13] <$arcielardor> I had some hard trouble getting the hang of it so I can sympathetize
[1:33:14] <+blastyoboots> wtf
[1:33:15] <Asuterisuku> Again, too direct.
[1:33:15] <spiderously> why are we still here? just to suffer?
[1:33:18] <%radregice> this game on controller vs mkb is night and day its insane
[1:33:21] <1000_buffers> that was JANK
[1:33:25] <$Spydurman> WAKE ME UP
[1:33:27] <Asuterisuku> Basically; look where you want to go.
[1:33:34] <Asuterisuku> Not at the wall.
[1:33:34] <+nemtehe> This is objectively bad. Like, this is the second level. At least show some tips or something. This SCREAMS jank
[1:33:40] <+wmeldrum> @javaa01 still the devs fault imo
[1:33:45] <%Pillagius> @ReallyBigRocks you can't change the height at which you run during the run, but jumping from one wall to another - it is possible by timing jump and dash properly.
[1:33:46] <1000_buffers> is v sync on?
[1:34:02] <BlackermanZX> LOL
[1:34:02] <+Jiggisnipe> D:
[1:34:03] <dukenux> FFFF

[1:34:05] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:34:06] <$arcielardor> trying to side-jump into the walls to wall run is an acquired skill

[1:34:06] <%andrewofbob> NotLikeThis
[1:34:07] <gamewarden92> What the hell
[1:34:08] <dukenux> LUL
[1:34:09] <+nemtehe> lul
[1:34:09] <%Juriasu> oh you are getting it Woolie, just gotta turn on that last one
[1:34:09] <Asuterisuku> Because you were staring at the wall you climbed it instead of running.
[1:34:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL NotLikeThis
[1:34:11] <sirmousehatter> LOL
[1:34:14] <dukenux> TOO GOOD 4Head
[1:34:15] <Nightwingie> kabajiKEK
[1:34:15] <+violaj26> pretty sure your supposed to slow down time to turn between jumps, thats how I learned this part at least
[1:34:18] <+blastyoboots> @Asuterisuku he HAS to look BETWEEN where he wants to go and the wall, the strafe isn't sufficient for some of the walls compared to going straight for some dumb reason
[1:34:19] <+Jiggisnipe> he was so good it become too good
[1:34:20] <%Javaa01> @wmeldrum I mean, you can only compensate so much when the game is designed for one input method only, and you're wrenching a controller into the mix
[1:34:20] <haitakaa> LUL
[1:34:20] <%radregice> reggie is all of us
[1:34:23] <+skylerpilot> @wmeldrum havn't played on controller but I can say that this section was not an issue on mkb
[1:34:24] <%nicversus> I am so sorry woolie
[1:34:24] <Nightwingie> that was really good!
[1:34:24] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:34:25] <%Pillagius> woolover the wall :D
[1:34:28] <skyentombment> BIG mad
[1:34:30] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus I JUST saw someone do this part exactly like you did right there
[1:34:36] <%czeekytv> Is Jump and Look on the same finger? Like maybe rebinding jump so you can look and jump at the same time would help? @WoolieVersus
[1:34:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say they didn't test this that much
[1:34:37] <%Nested_Dreams> And this is why Wallrun was cut from CP2077 - it's tough
[1:34:38] <%Juriasu> woolieKICKDAD
[1:34:38] <%andrewofbob> He's beginning to believe too much
[1:34:44] <+blastyoboots> WOOLIE: *blank stare*
[1:34:49] <JinJun1738> You can do it we believe i1881iKml i1881iKml i1881iKml
[1:34:50] <haitakaa> it's the angle
[1:34:57] <Asuterisuku> You came so close.
[1:34:57] <iacus_> the tilt
[1:35:04] <skyentombment> Woolie's face is in its Omikron mode
[1:35:06] <Nightwingie> you got this woolie kabajiBless
[1:35:07] <$Spydurman> CANT WAKE UP
[1:35:12] <+wmeldrum> \('o')/
[1:35:13] <Tisaric> if jumping isn't on a bumper for this game they messed up the controls - you definitely NEED your finger on the stick at all times
[1:35:15] <skyentombment> his face is now like a stone
[1:35:16] <%radregice> sbfpDattebayo
[1:35:16] <%Nested_Dreams> Oh that wallrun disconnect is jank and flaccid
[1:35:27] <+paladinstarbuster> can we play titan fall 2 instead?
[1:35:28] <bufflb> poor woolie
[1:35:34] <%johnny_gogo> woolie in gamer mode right now
[1:35:34] <%Javaa01> @Tisaric Bumper jumper is default here
[1:35:35] <+skylerpilot> @Tisaric they said earlier that bumper jump is the default
[1:35:40] <dukenux> that one honestly felt like the game pulling a ball out before the kick
[1:35:42] <Tisaric> ah ok good
[1:35:43] <+nemtehe> the dying grunt sounds like minecraft's hurt noise
[1:35:47] <$Spydurman> is Woolie suffering more now or during the FF14 stream?
[1:35:47] <%nicversus> the black eyed peas messed him up
[1:35:53] <TheBadonkulator> LEVELS CRITICAL
[1:35:54] <+wmeldrum> woolies gonna say the gamer word
[1:35:54] <%czeekytv> Then why is he not looking while jumping o.o
[1:36:01] <Asuterisuku> Much smoother getting to the part.
[1:36:06] <dukenux> It's Will.I.Am's fault
[1:36:10] <Nightwingie> ^
[1:36:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Man, this is brutal
[1:36:11] <%Lion_kun> I feel like this game is style over substance
[1:36:21] <Cornelius_Stirk> It is
[1:36:23] <%Nested_Dreams> what
[1:36:23] <dukenux> FFffuck u game
[1:36:26] <%andrewofbob> Bounced
[1:36:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> WHAT
[1:36:29] <JinJun1738> Maybe the camera use the camera trick you were talking about earlier
[1:36:30] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[1:36:30] <%nicversus> good dismount on that wall
[1:36:30] <bufflb> mogus final boss
[1:36:34] <$Spydurman> ?????
[1:36:36] <%johnny_gogo> reggie is making this content right now
[1:36:37] <+skylerpilot> Id probably rebind jump to a face button myself though, I havn't been able to get used to a bumper jump when its in stuff, I prefer claw grip to it currently still
[1:36:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Straight backwards lmao
[1:36:41] <spiderously> attempt #2553
[1:36:41] <%andrewofbob> So those lights have collision
[1:36:42] <$JobbedBone> anticipate the turn
[1:36:44] <Nightwingie> that was really good!
[1:36:45] <%andrewofbob> BUT WHY?
[1:36:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> jank
[1:36:49] <%nicversus> game jank
[1:36:54] <Nightwingie> jank
[1:36:57] <%johnny_gogo> no you held back so you when back
[1:36:59] <%nicversus> welcome to bounce theory
[1:37:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dude just wait til the end
[1:37:05] <+nemtehe> jankyard
[1:37:05] <+wmeldrum> el janko
[1:37:05] <+blastyoboots> too early on that last jum,p
[1:37:08] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you're looking too far to the left
[1:37:08] <Asuterisuku> Look right when making that last jump.
[1:37:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's SUPER jank
[1:37:10] <BlackermanZX> you jumped earlier it seems
[1:37:11] <+paladinstarbuster> gotta turn to the right
[1:37:15] <skyentombment> Commentaire?
[1:37:15] <%Juriasu> you need to turn just a bit on that last one
[1:37:15] <%andrewofbob> Theory: the lights on the wall have collision
[1:37:17] <bufflb> is this the final boss of the game?
[1:37:18] <Cornelius_Stirk> This game felt like the developers loved Ninja Gaiden but didn't understand what made it fun. They also seem to struggle with hitbox design
[1:37:19] <+nemtehe> JANK
[1:37:27] <+Cuon_Alpinus> the game is fine
[1:37:31] <Asuterisuku> It's like driving a car; look where you want to go.
[1:37:33] <Tisaric> the camera direction is the biggest determination of where you wall run
[1:37:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @bufflb you joke...
[1:37:34] <dukenux> he figured out 90% of it atleast
[1:37:39] <%radregice> not trying to defend the game but on that wall woolz is just facing it straight on
[1:37:41] <%psydaku> jump is too early
[1:37:42] <%Juriasu> THE GOD
[1:37:43] <Asuterisuku> He got it!
[1:37:44] <%radregice> there you go
[1:37:45] <BlackermanZX> EYYYYYY
[1:37:45] <gamewarden92> Yay
[1:37:45] <+Jiggisnipe> nice
[1:37:46] <Arrowpoison1> Nice!

[1:37:48] <+Bajimxenn> Well Done!
[1:37:49] <+wmeldrum> YEYEYE
[1:37:49] <skyentombment> thank jesus
[1:37:49] <Nightwingie> PogChamp
[1:37:49] <+paladinstarbuster> YEAAAAH BOI
[1:37:50] <Tisaric> yeah the camera direction is the most important aspect
[1:37:50] <dukenux> DAMMIT
[1:37:51] <TheBadonkulator> time to retire
[1:37:51] <%nicversus> that better be a fucking checkpoint
[1:37:51] <bufflb> ez

[1:37:53] <@Menitta> first try
[1:37:54] <Nightwingie> LET'S GOOOOOO
[1:37:54] <Asuterisuku> First try every time.
[1:37:55] <$JobbedBone> @Cornelius_Stirk all I see is woolie not doing it. its possible hes just missing it
[1:37:56] <%andrewofbob> DESTROYED
[1:37:58] <spiderously> AAAAAAAA
[1:37:59] <+nemtehe> LESS GOOO
[1:37:59] <IzanagiNoOokami> YYE.
[1:38:01] <+skylerpilot> @Cornelius_Stirk its more like a 3d Katana Zero
[1:38:03] <skyentombment> NOOOOO
[1:38:07] <KingOfTheGeats> LUL are we?
[1:38:09] <dukenux> RELEASE
[1:38:14] <DaKnightWarrior> SeemsGood
[1:38:15] <%0rond> first person platformers have the issue on controllers where you can't look around while using the face buttons, that's a failure only solved by the claw
[1:38:15] <skyentombment> NYAHO
[1:38:17] <Asuterisuku> Back to the content zone!
[1:38:22] <@Solidus_113> got a timestamp for that cut? LUL
[1:38:22] <JinJun1738> He did it miirioPepeHands miirioPepeHands miirioPepeHands
[1:38:33] <Cornelius_Stirk> @JobbedBone I played through the game. It felt janky as hell.
[1:38:34] <Asuterisuku> "Jack."
[1:38:41] <%Javaa01> Hit the orb first
[1:38:42] <dukenux> This is... John Runner
[1:38:43] <+blastyoboots> shielded
[1:38:43] <%radregice> visions of mgr
[1:38:45] <Asuterisuku> Ooh, new mechanic.
[1:38:46] <@Menitta> AW YEAH
[1:38:47] <Tisaric> the claw grip is only a problem if you bind jump to a face button
[1:38:48] <@Menitta> SourPls
[1:38:51] <+Bajimxenn> shields NotLikeThis
[1:38:52] <@Solidus_113> MUSIC TIME SourPls
[1:38:53] <Nightwingie> SourPls
[1:38:54] <%nicversus> gotta get back, back to the past ghostrunner jack
[1:38:54] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[1:39:01] <%nicversus> speaking of Will I Am
[1:39:04] <%johnny_gogo> this enemy type made pat quit
[1:39:04] <Tisaric> when it's on a bumper it's not as big of an issue
[1:39:23] <@Solidus_113> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:39:23] <+blastyoboots> when you dashed right into the bullet, that would have looked SOOOO COOL from the guard's perspective :D
[1:39:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:27] <%nicversus> orbs of steel
[1:39:27] <Johannen> And the game begins
[1:39:29] <@Menitta> I prefer the controls that make it feel like titanfall
[1:39:31] <Nightwingie> SourPls SourPls
[1:39:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SourPls
[1:39:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh man, this is fast
[1:39:55] <Asuterisuku> That parry though.
[1:39:55] <dukenux> footsies
[1:40:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @skyentombment
[1:40:07] <@Menitta> noixw
[1:40:08] <@Menitta> noice
[1:40:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> He's DOING IT
[1:40:24] <skyentombment> I can feel it coooooming in the air toniht
[1:40:34] <Johannen> That also works i guess
[1:40:44] <%andrewofbob> Death skip
[1:40:51] <Nightwingie> SourPls
[1:40:53] <skyentombment> WALL RUN
[1:40:57] <+blastyoboots> GOD this feels like you need to use mouse and keyboard
[1:41:03] <laguerrilha> He is now playing with mouse and keyboard right?
[1:41:05] <%Javaa01> The guy on the ground is bait, keep climbing
[1:41:09] <%radregice> still on controlelr
[1:41:10] <%nicversus> I'd hate to be the one guy who isn't protected by the orm
[1:41:11] <%radregice> controller
[1:41:12] <%nicversus> orb
[1:41:15] <%nicversus> like what the fuck
[1:41:15] <Tisaric> the game was definitely intended with kbm
[1:41:19] <spiderously> Woolie's frustrated, he's slipping
[1:41:22] <+blastyoboots> @laguerrilha he is DEFINITELY still playing with controller.
[1:41:34] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[1:41:38] <%andrewofbob> Choose death
[1:41:39] <@Menitta> this is a no death run
[1:41:41] <dukenux> QA
[1:41:42] <Johannen> Gamepad controls are fine
[1:41:52] <Johannen> I played with both its doable
[1:42:12] <+blastyoboots> @Johannen I can FEEL the gamepad aimjank frustrating every move here. does he have the sensitivity settings wrong or something?
[1:42:12] <bufflb> woolie's deep sighs are the best lol
[1:42:17] <Asuterisuku> You had a spot to land there.
[1:42:19] <Nightwingie> but this music though SourPls
[1:42:22] <Tisaric> they're totally fine but you can tell they really built it with an expectation of having smoothcamera positioning
[1:42:22] <laguerrilha> Woolie must have practiced a little then. way better than last time
[1:42:22] <+BettyMwwaahh> woolie seemed to frustrated to enjoy that out of bounds
[1:42:35] <%nicversus> not a fan of that wall placement
[1:42:36] <Johannen> @blastyoboots Its just his own ability to aim
[1:42:40] <%johnny_gogo> fatal error
[1:42:47] <+Cuon_Alpinus> just ignore the first guy
[1:42:57] <%Javaa01> Do not bother with the guy on the ground until you destroy the shield orb
[1:43:06] <Nightwingie> that happened to me a lot too
[1:43:17] <laguerrilha> how do you parry the bullets? you have to hit it with an atk or just hold a button?
[1:43:25] <+blastyoboots> @Johannen his cursor is leaping about so jumpily though. shouldn't it be a smoother progression of aim from a smaller deadzone?
[1:43:26] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you attack the bullet at the right time
[1:43:27] <Johannen> @laguerrilha Hit the projectile
[1:43:27] <Tisaric> yeah there's a parry
[1:43:29] <dukenux> the checkpoints are brutal
[1:43:38] <Johannen> @blastyoboots Not if he is flicking it
[1:43:42] <%Javaa01> @laguerrilha You have to click on the projectile like half a second before it hits you
[1:43:44] <spiderously> god this was soo much more enjoyable on kb+m
[1:44:02] <%Javaa01> Parries are not freebies
[1:44:26] <+blastyoboots> @Johannen oh YEAH he's started DOING it now!!! :D :D :D okay he's stopped flicking he's actually controlling it. error was between controller and couch :)
[1:44:29] <laguerrilha> @Javaa01 is the timing hard to get?
[1:44:30] <Asuterisuku> They have no chill.
[1:44:45] <Asuterisuku> That one was beautiful.
[1:44:46] <Tisaric> parry timing is kind of tight but not super strict
[1:44:49] <Nightwingie> PogChamp
[1:44:51] <+badjab326> woolie is getting better
[1:44:57] <+badjab326> hes LEARNING
[1:45:00] <Asuterisuku> Jumped too early.
[1:45:03] <Tisaric> tjere
[1:45:10] <%Javaa01> @laguerrilha Can you hit a relatively small projectile in a half second time window, adjusting for your velocity towards it, of course
[1:45:11] <%Lion_kun> THE MEMES JACK
[1:45:14] <laguerrilha> The Keyblade?
[1:45:23] <Tisaric> there's ways to make the parry more leniant as well
[1:45:28] <%nabby1> this isnt FFXIV?
[1:45:48] <%radregice> look up
[1:45:49] <spiderously> take a break after this level, don't quit half way, you'll have to restart
[1:45:50] <BlackermanZX> up
[1:46:00] <+paladinstarbuster> dig up
[1:46:03] <Asuterisuku> Smooth!
[1:46:17] <Asuterisuku> I love when I can say that without being sarcastic.
[1:46:19] <+blastyoboots> missed a switch
[1:46:37] <%nicversus> you got caught up on the CROSSFIRE
[1:46:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:46:39] <+blastyoboots> ooh double dash on ground is so good
[1:47:11] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:47:18] <Nightwingie> kabajiKEK
[1:47:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> I do that shit all the time
[1:47:23] <Tisaric> I think even I did that on KBM controls LUL
[1:47:27] <BlackermanZX> the gamer strafe
[1:47:28] <+blastyoboots> yeah Woolie back in the no-music-stuck section I noticed you leaning whenever you strafed
[1:47:37] <spiderously> this track though
[1:47:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Happens the most with racing games though
[1:48:04] <Asuterisuku> The Waypoint is pretty far from the radar, but it's also bouncing erratically when you're up here.
[1:48:32] <Asuterisuku> Stealth 100
[1:48:33] <skyentombment> Practice that wallrun for a bit
[1:48:45] <dirt_basket> speedrun when?
[1:49:05] <spiderously> he's beginning to believe
[1:49:20] <%Juriasu> always gotta protect your balls
[1:49:28] <Asuterisuku> The life is returning to his eyes
[1:49:31] <spiderously> ball on ball action
[1:49:34] <%Wakiza97> this doesn't seem to be intuitive on a controller
[1:49:39] <%bread_assassin> If they were smart. they'd make the balls protect each other.
[1:49:41] <skyentombment> OH NO WOOLIE'S COMING TO SHAVE MY balls!!!
[1:49:43] <Johannen> Use slowmo?
[1:49:45] <%andrewofbob> What's next, balls that shoot?
[1:50:10] <Asuterisuku> Can you parry a shot into the ball?
[1:50:15] <%Juriasu> no where to ghostrun
[1:50:40] <plaguedoctor_syan> Those blue orbs were Pat bane in his stream
[1:50:46] <1000_buffers> Reggie is so funny today :)
[1:50:56] <halfmasks> @Juriasu no where to ghost hide, your journey ends here ghostrunner
[1:50:57] <%Juriasu> what
[1:51:02] <Asuterisuku> So close
[1:51:11] <%Juriasu> what was that about running in woolies pants
[1:51:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Remember the slowmo
[1:51:22] <BlackermanZX> hes getting it
[1:52:01] <skyentombment> skeleton balll
[1:52:23] <sirmousehatter> there's a trick to getting slow mo on the ground, but it's not intuitive

[1:54:08] <+RealPT1> Woolie giving it a runback?
[1:54:10] <thedudeinthered> Reggie is the real puppetmaster in this LP
[1:54:14] <Asuterisuku> Ooh, this looks tricky.
[1:54:25] <Asuterisuku> Level design.

[1:54:59] <Asuterisuku> Above?
[1:55:38] <ItsKamWithAK> Hi chat
[1:55:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ItsKamWithAK hi
[1:55:50] <%Juriasu> hey :)
[1:55:53] <dukenux> i live, i die, i live again
[1:55:55] <Asuterisuku> Look down.
[1:55:59] <%Javaa01> Hole on your right
[1:56:03] <%andrewofbob> This place is a Health & Safety nightmare
[1:56:06] <BlackermanZX> hole down?
[1:56:44] <%Juriasu> a hood ornament?
[1:56:48] <skyentombment> a whole car hood ornament as an earring?
[1:56:54] <skyentombment> that's impractical
[1:57:02] <Asuterisuku> Those ornaments can be pretty big.
[1:57:04] <Johannen> Who needs cars when you live in a Dread Tower
[1:57:08] <sirmousehatter> that's one BIG earring
[1:57:19] <Asuterisuku> I don't even think Mercedes puts them on anymore.
[1:57:25] <Asuterisuku> That IS real.
[1:57:44] <dukenux> that's why Mercedes doesn't do it anymore, huh
[1:57:45] <Johannen> Yeah, that's why the automatic ones where you can hide them is a thing
[1:57:48] <%nicversus> rich people don't care about that though, which is why rich people cars have the most obnoxious protrusions
[1:57:51] <Asuterisuku> Impaled by the ornament.
[1:57:59] <%Javaa01> I mean, there's a reason why the ornament on a Merc can pivot back
[1:58:07] <thedudeinthered> Brings a new meaning to the term ‘car horn’
[1:58:09] <%andrewofbob> The Flying Lady on the Rolls Royce might get that last HP
[1:58:23] <Asuterisuku> Always foe.
[1:58:30] <%Javaa01> There are no friends
[1:58:35] <%Javaa01> Friends are all dead
[1:58:42] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can sidestep shots while in slowmo
[1:58:43] <%andrewofbob> Just like real life
[1:59:19] <alexsumac> @andrewofbob lol
[1:59:21] <skyentombment> stinkyyyyy
[1:59:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the one thing i wish this game had was a replay feature in third person
[1:59:43] <dukenux> mercedes hood ornament looks fragile, but it might help to aim at pedestrians
[1:59:48] <@Menitta> aw man
[1:59:52] <@Menitta> these parts suck
[1:59:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TRON TIME
[1:59:54] <%nicversus> I love how impotently aggro these guards are
[1:59:57] <Asuterisuku> Back into the Bitcrushed

[2:00:14] <nicversus> this *place* is where we'll seize the means or production, comrade
[2:00:21] <%Javaa01> Time to do a block puzzle
[2:00:27] <%radregice> PUZZLEBOIS
[2:00:32] <@Solidus_113> the red block
[2:00:48] <%andrewofbob> Does that mean someone fucked a robot?
[2:00:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:56] <SwerveBootyHammer> this part kinda sucks
[2:00:58] <+Mr_Misanthropy> A virtual grunt of the digital age. That's just great.

[2:01:39] <Parapattern> Puzzles and Thinking
[2:01:42] <@Menitta> there is. it's bad
[2:01:42] <%Juriasu> was playing nier earlier thinking that block puzzles kind of went away, but I guess they are back
[2:01:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea
[2:01:47] <Asuterisuku> You don't want it.

[2:03:56] <@Solidus_113> Specifically Legacy
[2:04:04] <BlackermanZX> DOPE
[2:04:07] <%Javaa01> This has a very long cooldown though
[2:04:16] <skyentombment> VERY much needed
[2:04:16] <@Solidus_113> it's not a free ability though
[2:04:18] <%Javaa01> So it's not a get out of jail free card you can rely on all the time
[2:04:19] <Parapattern> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[2:04:25] <Asuterisuku> New upgrades!
[2:04:32] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its costs BAr thou
[2:04:34] <%HollowedIdjit> You can totally just leave btw-
[2:04:34] <@Solidus_113> meter for it on the left
[2:04:34] <%Javaa01> Oh you should have new Tetris blocks availabe
[2:04:58] <Asuterisuku> More power available.
[2:05:14] <%Javaa01> Less perks means more recharge
[2:05:17] <@Solidus_113> and dying keeps your meter gain, no reset
[2:05:20] <%nicversus> extreme tetris
[2:05:22] <%radregice> i completely forgot about this mechanic
[2:05:28] <%radregice> the free slots part LUL
[2:05:29] <%Javaa01> Gimp your moveset for more get out of jail free cards
[2:05:30] <BlackermanZX> new navicust piece
[2:05:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the more unused slots the faster it recharges on its own
[2:05:34] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus More empty boxes with lightning = more power
[2:05:44] <+blastyoboots> oooooh so you get benefits even if you can't use all your slots!
[2:05:49] <+blastyoboots> that's SO cool
[2:05:57] <penitentpendant> I assume the +125%. The 25% bonus coming from the 5 free slots on screen.
[2:06:22] <@Solidus_113> sensory boost is the blink time slow
[2:06:23] <%Javaa01> @penitentpendant It's 1.25, not 125%
[2:06:34] <Parapattern> Chiral
[2:06:36] <%Arancet> @penitentpendant thats +1.25, i think extra energy recharge per sec
[2:06:37] <penitentpendant> @Javaa01 Didn't see the dot
[2:06:38] <Johannen> Its not as good as you think
[2:06:38] <%jepupu> Is the pink one blink?
[2:06:38] <@Solidus_113> I think, or it's the general time slow on dodge
[2:07:12] <%Javaa01> The less free slots, the lower your passive recharge
[2:07:19] <%Juriasu> that's cool
[2:07:20] <Asuterisuku> If you want to Blink lots, take fewer perks.
[2:07:24] <%Javaa01> So if you wanna use the ability, dump all the perks
[2:07:29] <%Javaa01> But you gotta be good enough
[2:08:41] <@Solidus_113> oh man, he's going to have so many accidental blinks from gripping the controller

[2:09:14] <+BettyMwwaahh> mopLUL mopLUL mopLUL
[2:09:21] <%Javaa01> It's flashing red because woolie is mashing L3
[2:09:24] <@Solidus_113> DEATH GRIP CONTROLLER
[2:09:25] <Parapattern> First try
[2:09:28] <moeartifact> there's an instant restart option in the PC version you can enable, i used it when i knew i fucked up a run
[2:09:48] <%Javaa01> Rigor Mortis has already kicked in
[2:09:53] <penitentpendant> And that's why I hate the "L3" button
[2:10:08] <Johannen> This explains a lot about Woolie ability with the gamepad if the PUSHES in his sticks
[2:10:46] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[2:10:50] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Your active abilities like blink and the others you unlock later will IGNORE SHIELDS
[2:11:01] <+the_vedo_show> SourPls
[2:11:08] <thedudeinthered> And this was the point where I perma-quit this game. Too many abilities made this game too complicated to stay fun.
[2:11:20] <+Cuon_Alpinus> the game really isdnt that complicated at all
[2:11:38] <Ziegsy> oh! motion sickness, the game!
[2:11:44] <@Menitta> the default binding is not great imo
[2:11:48] <sirmousehatter> I almost never used my ability because I always wanted to safe it for later lol
[2:12:07] <Johannen> @Menitta Its the only good binding for keeping your thumbs on sticks at all times
[2:12:11] <%psydaku> this is the first ive heard of this problem
[2:12:11] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @sirmousehatter thats why you unlock pulse fist and use the busted hopup that refreshes it if you kill 2+ enemies
[2:12:26] <%Javaa01> Control schemes, not keyboard bindings
[2:12:31] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You are in the Keyboard setup, wrong screen
[2:12:36] <Asuterisuku> Q is the button.
[2:12:43] <penitentpendant> Control schemes
[2:12:48] <@Menitta> Yeah, but I wanted it to be as close to feeling like Titanfall as possible
[2:12:59] <@Menitta> I used Vanguard
[2:13:03] <Johannen> You want Tactical
[2:13:10] <Johannen> One of the variant
[2:13:23] <%Javaa01> Bumper Jumper Tactical
[2:13:23] <Johannen> There is a couple of Tactical variants
[2:13:37] <Johannen> ^
[2:13:39] <@Solidus_113> can you go to key config and set controller stuff there
[2:13:46] <%Javaa01> Woolie pls
[2:13:47] <%Arancet> go to Bumper Jumper Tactical
[2:13:53] <%sapphire34> woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:13:55] <Johannen> I think i also use Bumper Jumper Tactical
[2:14:04] <%AyotoCorp> This is on Steam right?
[2:14:08] <Ziegsy> is this game epilepsy friendly?
[2:14:18] <Johannen> Alt Tactical
[2:14:23] <Johannen> That what it was
[2:14:26] <%Javaa01> Bumper Jumper Alt puts it on X instead of L3
[2:14:48] <Johannen> What is your jump on default?
[2:14:57] <%Arancet> @Johannen RB
[2:14:57] <Johannen> Its the SAME
[2:15:15] <Johannen> As Bumper Jumper is it not?
[2:15:23] <Johannen> Sorry
[2:15:27] <Johannen> My apologies
[2:15:32] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus If this is the Steam version you could just use Steam's controller input to just unbind L3 for now
[2:15:34] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:15:38] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @Ziegsy noooo
[2:16:02] <Johannen> Screen was going by too quickly i saw it in the other place

[2:16:11] <Parapattern> SSStylish
[2:16:12] <Ziegsy> @cuon_alpinus thank you for the answer! Ill proceed with caution and duck out when appropriate
[2:16:16] <+nemtehe> Woolie are you gonna play titanfall 2 again sometime soon?
[2:16:17] <@Menitta> one trick I started doing is if I finish a room, I'll just jump off a ledge so the checkpoint can reset me closer lol
[2:16:20] <%nicversus> where we droppin boys
[2:16:22] <Nightwingie> LUL
[2:16:23] <%andrewofbob> Good recovery, though
[2:16:28] <%SirGO0SE> Girls are watching Woolie!
[2:16:35] <%Javaa01> The Walls Have Balls
[2:16:37] <@Menitta> this part's tricky
[2:16:59] <Asuterisuku> Balls to the Wall hard.
[2:17:04] <+Cuon_Alpinus> there's Jank I know and love LUL
[2:17:20] <Asuterisuku> RIP Blink charge.
[2:17:33] <Ziegsy> Oh! is this like.. whats it called, super hot or something? you have to get the perfect setup?
[2:17:48] <+Cuon_Alpinus> You can blink through shielded enemies and still kill them. The abilities ignore shields.
[2:17:56] <%Arancet> @Ziegsy probably thinking more hotline miami but yes
[2:18:13] <%SirGO0SE> this game is such a Genji check LUL
[2:18:21] <@Menitta> Shielded enemies can be killed with blink
[2:18:28] <Ziegsy> @arancet thank you! thats such a cool idea
[2:18:39] <%Javaa01> Not that relevant in this arena, but it will be later
[2:18:55] <%bread_assassin> So far, the ideal path takes him by both balls anyway, though.
[2:19:01] <@Menitta> you could try to grapple past to the points you started at after you kill those two guys
[2:19:36] <Johannen> This whole game is a series of combat puzzle encounters
[2:19:39] <Asuterisuku> It was the other guys that shot you though.
[2:19:44] <TheFramedWarlock> Keep wallrunning whenever you can Woolie
[2:20:05] <@Menitta> HWHEW
[2:20:15] <Asuterisuku> You can tell when he's panicking by the BOOP BOOP
[2:20:21] <%LordSDB> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:20:31] <WG101> @Asuterisuku dedicated panic button
[2:20:40] <%johnny_gogo> this is the room pat quit on
[2:21:05] <@Solidus_113> this is a good one
[2:21:06] <Asuterisuku> Prove it!
[2:21:19] <Ziegsy> I can see pat quitting on this.
[2:21:22] <sirmousehatter> Man, this is a big room
[2:21:53] <WG101> WOMP WOMP
[2:22:06] <Asuterisuku> Did it too good
[2:22:09] <Johannen> This soundtrack sure has nice womp womp's
[2:22:09] <@Menitta> guard: [exists] Woolie: WOMP WOMP
[2:22:13] <sirmousehatter> nice recovery
[2:22:17] <%andrewofbob> This rooms looks way more freeform than anything before
[2:22:28] <Asuterisuku> If you miss it on the way past don't go back for it, move on to the next one.
[2:22:36] <TheFramedWarlock> @WoolieVersus It's better to keep your moment and keep wallrunning than try to fix your mistakes
[2:23:34] <+blastyoboots> I like that the guards say f*** you, it's what someone WOULD say in that situation. unless I'm mishearing what they're saying which is possible

[2:23:52] <WG101> @blastyoboots it's totally "fuck you"
[2:24:11] <sirmousehatter> shield is protected by shield, that's next level
[2:24:29] <Nightwingie> SourPls
[2:24:41] <penitentpendant> @sirmousehatter At which point you ask the designers why can't they just shield themselves
[2:24:44] <@Menitta> how did he die lmao
[2:24:54] <Asuterisuku> The light has returned to Woolie's eyes and he's having fun again.
[2:25:00] <haitakaa> they show up as enemies on the map
[2:25:01] <+luftraumm1> when's discooo
[2:25:17] <%Arancet> @Menitta used blink and had too much momentum, flung himself off the edge
[2:25:29] <@Menitta> oh I meant the guard
[2:25:30] <%Javaa01> Gotta make a 45 degree turn around that corner with dash
[2:25:31] <Asuterisuku> Get out around that wall and look left?
[2:25:39] <@Menitta> It didnt look like Woolie hit him
[2:26:44] <dinnydanny777> this looks like the kind of game you turn mouse sensitivity way up for limesHmm
[2:26:54] <haitakaa> yeah it's behind that wall
[2:27:18] <@Menitta> NCIE
[2:27:22] <%Afterman_> god save by the hookshot
[2:27:25] <sirmousehatter> gotta perfect that run
[2:27:30] <%Afterman_> with the hookshot woolie is unstoppable
[2:27:30] <357Sneak> lytBADMAN CLUtch
[2:27:35] <@Menitta> yes you absolutely can
[2:27:37] <Asuterisuku> ANY game with wall running.
[2:27:53] <@Menitta> speedruns of this game are nuts
[2:28:07] <dukenux> atleast the grapple reach is generous
[2:28:12] <%AyotoCorp> A lot of the speedruns are just people sliding at mach 4 on the edge of the level geometry
[2:28:25] <Asuterisuku> But you can take a shortcut through the middle.
[2:28:28] <@Solidus_113> they're called tethers, you learned that during FF14
[2:28:48] <Josef_Stryker> Bold of you to assume he paid attention Kappa
[2:28:49] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:28:53] <skyentombment> OOOOOO
[2:29:09] <Asuterisuku> You're doing just fine this game is actually hard.
[2:29:33] <%Arancet> mkb really makes it easier, although probably wouldnt help woolie given his inexperience with it
[2:29:43] <sirmousehatter> I retried this level so many times even with kmb. you're doing fine woolie
[2:29:53] <@Menitta> NOOO
[2:29:54] <Asuterisuku> Imagine wall running on a convex surface
[2:29:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> clean
[2:30:04] <%andrewofbob> Overkill
[2:30:04] <skyentombment> stop running, ghostrunner

[2:31:59] <skyentombment> Come on tho
[2:32:04] <capten31> wowowop
[2:32:07] <TheFramedWarlock> The best tactic is jump then use the slowmo dash
[2:32:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's over ghostrunner!
[2:32:12] <penitentpendant> Anakin knows the feel
[2:32:12] <@Menitta> Dont try it
[2:32:23] <Asuterisuku> Stream just froxe3
[2:32:32] <Asuterisuku> Ahem, froze. Back now though.
[2:32:36] <%andrewofbob> It might be worth doing a blink kill on a shielded enemy if it's convenient
[2:33:44] <sirmousehatter> @ziegsy keyboard and mouse. sorry typo lol
[2:33:46] <+Jiggisnipe> this is the game
[2:33:49] <DaKnightWarrior> It's fine.
[2:33:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nah man that's how this goes
[2:33:54] <@Menitta> nah this is the Ghostrunner experience
[2:34:04] <Nightwingie> enjoy the game kmaHypers
[2:34:16] <%nicversus> yeah this is fun
[2:34:19] <skyentombment> It's like in Hotline miami
[2:34:24] <DaKnightWarrior> It's fun to watch you learn.
[2:34:32] <skyentombment> the fun is repeating until you get the sick look
[2:34:37] <skyentombment> loop*
[2:34:39] <+Jiggisnipe> game about trial error til you perfect execution
[2:34:40] <%Arancet> if you 'waste' blink, you dont lose its energy, but it does go on a short (~5s)cd
[2:34:41] <%nicversus> I ran to the washroom and I was worried you'd have cleared the room by the time I got back
[2:35:36] <Asuterisuku> He came super close, too.
[2:35:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bruhhhh
[2:35:41] <skyentombment> Nice sabe
[2:35:45] <Nightwingie> close!
[2:35:47] <%nicversus> one bullet
[2:36:00] <Asuterisuku> I felt that one.
[2:36:01] <skyentombment> ONE BULLET
[2:36:10] <capten31> wopwop
[2:36:13] <%Arancet> yeah, enemies has perfect accuracy, but bullets are slow

[2:39:26] <sirmousehatter> it looks so coll when you do it in one go though
[2:39:28] <+Joe2187> I feel like the player character needs more weight to compensate for the jank

[2:40:41] <%Arancet> thats PROGRESS
[2:40:44] <%johnny_gogo> and we aint done yet
[2:40:45] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus and just so you know, quitting mid level restarts you at the beginning of it, no checkpoints there
[2:41:02] <%nicversus> good shit, Woolie
[2:41:10] <wibbwobbler> noice man
[2:41:24] <Nightwingie> hey kmaAnger
[2:41:25] <Robot_Nixon_> is there an ingame timer for runs?
[2:41:35] <%Javaa01> And here's your first "you can't just EZ parry everything"
[2:41:37] <%johnny_gogo> it wont help with these guys
[2:41:38] <sirmousehatter> each death is an xp gained
[2:41:39] <%andrewofbob> These guys don't edge
[2:41:46] <@Solidus_113> those guys specifically do
[2:41:52] <%Javaa01> Because you can deflect one shot, but not the next one from these guys
[2:41:56] <%Javaa01> The firerate is too high
[2:41:56] <%nicversus> he got you on his last bullet
[2:41:58] <El_Rabbit> @Tuna_Can_0 Yes, and a death count
[2:41:59] <Asuterisuku> New enemies are always nice
[2:42:09] <Nightwingie> SourPls
[2:42:13] <+Joe2187> You need to have some slow down on a grapple, and some more weight to your character in order to make this more readable
[2:42:30] <Asuterisuku> He is fine with Jack.
[2:42:40] <%SirGO0SE> is that a Raiden reference?
[2:42:43] <Asuterisuku> There are some who call me Jack.
[2:42:47] <%nicversus> that ain't it, chief
[2:42:49] <%SirGO0SE> since Raiden was Jack
[2:42:51] <Asuterisuku> Samurai Jack Ep. 1
[2:42:55] <%Javaa01> Gotta remember to jump
[2:43:06] <thedudeinthered> Also because its the nost generic-ass american action hero name : V
[2:43:08] <Johannen> He is just a GhostRunner V3.5
[2:43:08] <%Javaa01> Early is still better then not at all
[2:43:20] <@Solidus_113> yeah, now that I think of it there's a lot of katana users named jack
[2:43:41] <%SirGO0SE> true. but the cyborg ninja thing makes me a little sus
[2:43:57] <%nicversus> Jack the Ripper
[2:44:04] <Johannen> Is he a Cyborg?
[2:44:22] <%SirGO0SE> I mean that hand doesn't look very fleshy LUL
[2:44:36] <%nicversus> these guys aren't storm troopers
[2:44:39] <Johannen> I didnt think he was a human to begin with
[2:44:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is that the way you're supposed to go?
[2:44:55] <Johannen> Not realy
[2:44:58] <%andrewofbob> To be fair, my favourite kills in Apex are those on players who thought shooting through the air would keep them safe.
[2:44:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:45:00] <%Arancet> there is a grapple right after the first guy that he hasnt noticed
[2:45:21] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:45:23] <Johannen> There are 2 paths and Woolie is going backwards
[2:45:37] <%SirGO0SE> @andrewofbob hows Apex been? I checked out awhile ago but have been fiending for an fps
[2:45:44] <+MasterE1> did I just walk into the game I wanted since mirror's edge?
[2:45:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why commit to one path when you can do both at once, that's big brain
[2:46:11] <+Cuon_Alpinus> I cant wait till he sees the walkers LUL
[2:46:29] <%nicversus> good run
[2:46:43] <Johannen> There are always multiple solutions to these combat puzzles, but there are optimal ways to get around
[2:46:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Asthma?
[2:46:50] <Asuterisuku> In world explanation
[2:47:03] <gamewarden92> GIRL IS WATCHING NOW
[2:47:09] <%nicversus> aaaannnnnd I'm dead
[2:47:12] <+pupil31> SourPls
[2:47:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hope she's got that radio on push-to-talk because she's gonna be real motion sick now
[2:47:37] <%Pillagius> "seeing the world from your perspective will make things much easier!" minute later -> ohnPuke ohnPuke ohnPuke
[2:47:50] <%andrewofbob> @andrewofbob It's looking healthy, although hackers and DDoSers are becoming more frequent. New season drops next week with 3v3 arena, and the daughter of Mr. "In the Pipes, 5-by-5"
[2:48:05] <Asuterisuku> Can you cancel a blink if there's no target?
[2:48:16] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:48:22] <%nicversus> aaaaaaahhh
[2:48:32] <Asuterisuku> Specifically in a way that doesn't waste your meter?
[2:48:43] <%SirGO0SE> @andrewofbob nice. hopefully they get that sorted out for the next season, might be a good time to get back in
[2:48:55] <Johannen> @Asuterisuku It does not waste it just puts in on a little cooldown
[2:48:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> AIR JUKES
[2:49:04] <%Arancet> @Asuterisuku yes, it doesnt waste meter if you cancel, but it goes go on a short cd
[2:49:51] <%SirGO0SE> is that first guy on the right getting him?
[2:49:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> The one shotting seems a little much but I do like that the enemies will just blast the fuck out of you constantly
[2:50:22] <%Arancet> could try going to the left first
[2:50:24] <+athuramn> it's easier to go left btw
[2:50:41] <T_Sasquatch> Is Woolie able to play like a normal person now ?
[2:50:42] <+athuramn> right doesn't give you cover till you get around the back
[2:50:52] <El_Rabbit> This was my first struggle with the game. Once i beated i feel soo satisfied
[2:51:23] <+athuramn> @el_rabbit which is the only reason I know to go left. this shit was burned into my brain over how bad I was till I finished this sequence
[2:51:27] <+Cuon_Alpinus> dash-slide jumping on the ground gives you a noticeable boost of speed
[2:51:33] <+Cuon_Alpinus> at the cost of motion sickness LUL
[2:51:35] <Asuterisuku> The machine gunner not giving you the time to make the kill.
[2:51:53] <%SirGO0SE> so clsoe
[2:52:21] <Johannen> That would be broken
[2:52:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[2:52:28] <@Solidus_113> nice
[2:52:31] <%Arancet> nice
[2:52:31] <+Cuon_Alpinus> that parry tho

[2:52:35] <+nemtehe> Sweet
[2:52:39] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[2:52:40] <Asuterisuku> I like that slowdown on the last kill.
[2:52:44] <+athuramn> yeah, this game would make your head explode in vr

[2:54:11] <%nicversus> I like how his sword cycles through idle animations even though you're running
[2:54:20] <Equirah> thinking you get to coast in this game LUL
[2:54:38] <%nicversus> super bunnyhopping
[2:54:38] <dds333a> HL2 strats
[2:54:47] <Asuterisuku> Woolie turned into DINO there for a moment.
[2:55:06] <dds333a> Nice
[2:55:15] <%nicversus> he lost his leg privileges
[2:55:27] <sirmousehatter> bunny hopping is an actual critical skill if you remember that you can slowmo after you jump
[2:56:26] <dds333a> Ooh, almost had it, tho
[2:56:30] <%SirGO0SE> real ninja hours
[2:56:36] <Johannen> BunnyHopping is old news Boomer, its all about Slidehopping Gramps

[2:56:49] <skyentombment> secret death
[2:56:53] <%nicversus> woolies posting their Ws
[2:56:56] <Asuterisuku> "Think there's a secret up there?" *looks up to see death*
[2:56:57] <skyentombment> The secret ingredient is death
[2:57:00] <%SirGO0SE> guess ill die then :)
[2:57:02] <%andrewofbob> Honourable way out
[2:57:08] <Jaysky> That things used to be different
[2:57:09] <dds333a> He was on the other wall, looked like, or just the rail, which you can walk on
[2:57:10] <+athuramn> absolutely
[2:57:29] <Asuterisuku> There was a floor to the left though.
[2:57:51] <dds333a> Hindu symbology out here
[2:57:51] <El_Rabbit> Woolie is doding speedrun strats without realizing
[2:57:51] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:57:59] <%Skullgod> xenoBrain
[2:58:02] <+athuramn> hmmm, not the direction I thought he was gonna go
[2:58:14] <%nicversus> Woolies posting their Ls
[2:58:18] <%SirGO0SE> these devs really got their moneys worth with these assets huh
[2:58:48] <+athuramn> see, I don't even fault him for thinking that because this game begs to be explored
[2:59:09] <+athuramn> but, with nothing to explore unfortunately
[2:59:12] <$SilverRoddo> Ninja Gaiden
[2:59:50] <%SirGO0SE> yeah this is kinda what id imagine the NES Ninja Gaiden world to look like
[2:59:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:59:55] <Asuterisuku> I really don't like this guy Adam.
[2:59:57] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:00:03] <%nicversus> that was me
[3:00:17] <@Menitta> ooooh this part's haaaard
[3:00:20] <%Afterman_> wolshiveks unite
[3:00:27] <Johannen> @Asuterisuku Adam? What you got against a dead dude?
[3:00:51] <%Afterman_> woolie defeated God to become his better
[3:00:54] <@Menitta> there's a path to the right
[3:00:58] <%nicversus> I was woolsheviks guy
[3:01:08] <+athuramn> @menitta not if you never look there
[3:01:17] <+athuramn> out of sight, out of reality
[3:02:49] <+Rlexp> am I crazy or is woolie doing this area completely backwards
[3:03:14] <%Arancet> probably, but this looks like a pretty good path
[3:03:15] <Asuterisuku> The shield generator is markes as an enemy on the radar. That's handy.
[3:03:16] <%nicversus> it could be both
[3:03:17] <sirmousehatter> he's taking the road less taken
[3:03:27] <Hammatime8> @Rlexp I don't think he's even supposed to be able to chain those first two grapples together
[3:03:31] <+athuramn> he did break some pathing a little because one guys not even responding but this game is flexible
[3:03:53] <%radregice> a lot of enemy areas like this usually have at least one alternate pathway you could take to clear out the room
[3:04:07] <+athuramn> he misses out on "flow" but I don't think he's aiming for leaderboard times here
[3:04:35] <$SilverRoddo> Where we going, we don’t need—paths mikeliveRyuHayabusa
[3:04:37] <%nicversus> free woolie
[3:04:55] <+Rlexp> I mean based on the deaths we might need intended paths lmao
[3:05:37] <@Menitta> nah the number of deaths would still be the same
[3:05:52] <+athuramn> In a weird way, him being able to get to the orb that quickly is a nice cut but if he's not aware of enemy positions then it's hard to deal with the whole area after
[3:05:57] <%andrewofbob> Bait and punish
[3:06:22] <%nicversus> super intendo
[3:06:28] <Asuterisuku> The route you were using might actually be better.
[3:06:32] <+athuramn> OH HE DID IT
[3:06:35] <%nicversus> intendo 64
[3:06:42] <+athuramn> @menitta reality entered
[3:06:46] <@Menitta> that way still works

[3:08:24] <DaKnightWarrior> nice
[3:08:29] <%Afterman_> woolie going his QA way
[3:08:40] <+athuramn> excuse me, what did he just do
[3:09:01] <+athuramn> lmao, he made those bullet dodges look easy
[3:09:11] <%radregice> what a hero
[3:09:17] <@Menitta> i love how he's like "cmooooon let em diiiie"
[3:09:25] <%Afterman_> woolie WAS the coolest guy
[3:09:32] <Asuterisuku> Woolie firing the plot shotgun.
[3:09:37] <penitentpendant> "You better have AT LEAST 4 arms!"
[3:09:41] <+athuramn> "this is a mistake" instantly dies

[3:11:45] <%SirGO0SE> Solidus fucking games
[3:12:03] <+athuramn> I enjoyed this game but some of the mind sequences are dog water
[3:12:04] <Asuterisuku> Time slow panels!
[3:12:28] <Asuterisuku> >Electricity not dangerous
[3:12:51] <%andrewofbob> It's bad for your health, but your health is also a binary state
[3:13:00] <%Arancet> down?
[3:13:02] <%0rond> there's signage pointing down...
[3:13:18] <masterfire23> yeah I can't stand the mind sequences
[3:13:20] <+Infeirno23> he def said more dangerous then electricity not that electricity wasntt dangerous
[3:13:34] <%andrewofbob> Why the the slowdown make you fall faster in real time?
[3:13:42] <+athuramn> shhh
[3:13:52] <+athuramn> because physics
[3:13:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't think about it
[3:14:00] <Asuterisuku> That slash hitbox is really generous, isn't it.

[3:24:39] <%AyotoCorp> Iirc the focus bar only remains full if it was full at the last checkpoint. If it was partially full then it keeps its progress filling up between retries
[3:25:04] <+athuramn> that timing tho
[3:26:05] <Asuterisuku> These guys are very passionate about running out of bullets.
[3:26:30] <%andrewofbob> @Asuterisuku You miss every shot you don't take
[3:26:42] <%nicversus> I love how every enemy is the same person. They're all woolieONEGUY
[3:27:00] <+athuramn> that's racist
[3:27:24] <%radregice> secret GET
[3:27:35] <Asuterisuku> Do you keep secrets if you die after picking them up?
[3:27:36] <Hammatime8> Lemon!
[3:27:44] <%Arancet> @Asuterisuku yes
[3:27:49] <sirmousehatter> food's food
[3:27:50] <%radregice> yeah, but you have to beat the level to fully save them
[3:27:53] <%radregice> i think?
[3:27:57] <+athuramn> architect, this is literally the only path ahead anyway, wht you on about
[3:27:58] <$SilverRoddo> Yea. Riddler trophy
[3:28:25] <+pupil31> SourPls
[3:29:11] <%Arancet> they can shoot through the red
[3:29:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:29:43] <+yusefHD> catJAM lmaoo
[3:29:49] <+athuramn> that's like a nice bit of Mario platforming before going into the next area
[3:29:56] <Asuterisuku> Yeyeye
[3:30:51] <+yusefHD> "nobody canna cross it" lmfaooo
[3:31:03] <T_Sasquatch> These one hit kill games seem fun until you've done the same encounter 30 times
[3:31:23] <T_Sasquatch> Repeated failures NotLikeThis
[3:31:32] <+athuramn> but then it gets real fun when you beat the game without failures
[3:31:33] <+yusefHD> IDK. I'd be mad if there was a loading screen - if it means you hop back in, that's my shit tbh
[3:31:57] <sirmousehatter> trying it again and again until you get it perfect is the fun though
[3:32:03] <Asuterisuku> You should be able to Blink them both if you get close.
[3:32:04] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Dont forget about being able to kill shielded enemies with dash
[3:32:05] <sirmousehatter> but it's not for everyone
[3:32:21] <+athuramn> I think these two would benefit from watching a movement video once just to see what the upper limits of what they can do
[3:32:21] <+Cuon_Alpinus> hell yeah
[3:32:24] <sirmousehatter> nice
[3:32:24] <%Arancet> nice
[3:32:28] <Hammatime8> Let's fucking GO
[3:32:34] <+yusefHD> I ragequit hades, mostly 'cause of the "go back to the start buddy" thing. But this looks damn good.
[3:33:11] <Asuterisuku> They're... not really comparable games.
[3:33:13] <trasherxl> On the "poor people living above rich" - that was setting of one of Isaac Azimov's book series, where extreme overpopulation led to development of vast underground cities where most of humanity lived. After generations of this agoraphobia became norm, making deep levels prime real estate and surface undesirable.
[3:33:22] <+Cuon_Alpinus> midair chimmy
[3:33:30] <+yusefHD> Twitch based is really the only similarity tbh LUL
[3:33:39] <+athuramn> how is it that going on pats channel I get Johnnie walker but on woolies I get ads for rum up the wazzoo
[3:33:39] <+yusefHD> and dying a bunch*
[3:34:12] <Asuterisuku> I think this route isn't working.
[3:34:19] <%Arancet> slot in blink range extender?
[3:34:31] <+yusefHD> unintended speedrun strat
[3:34:32] <+Cuon_Alpinus> activating blink too early
[3:34:47] <sirmousehatter> getting them in one line is really tricky
[3:35:30] <+athuramn> design language in this game almost always points to going on the most well lit panel
[3:35:45] <+yusefHD> PogChamp
[3:35:54] <+yusefHD> AHHH
[3:36:00] <+yusefHD> You got the lines
[3:36:29] <+yusefHD> we believe in you woolz
[3:36:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:36:46] <sirmousehatter> getting close now
[3:37:10] <Asuterisuku> Bullet at the end of the iframes. You got meatied
[3:37:19] <+athuramn> err, sort of? he was closer the first times, just went on the wrong panel
[3:37:20] <sirmousehatter> that's weird
[3:37:26] <BUDderzIllA> Noo, not the bullets!
[3:37:35] <KnightAsteran> speed is life
[3:38:00] <skyentombment> Bullets! my only weakness!
[3:38:19] <+yusefHD> Do you have to jump at that second wall, or could you just drop down?
[3:38:29] <+Cuon_Alpinus> momentum carries him off
[3:38:33] <+Cuon_Alpinus> he's not jumping
[3:38:41] <+yusefHD> OH damn - homie's moving fast lmfao
[3:39:05] <+athuramn> you could jump but it puts you in a weird spot if it's timed when they're firing
[3:41:30] <+Cuon_Alpinus> he'll still walk over if you dont start blink earlier
[3:41:31] <@Solidus_113> you could change your upgrades to support a better blink
[3:41:34] <+Cuon_Alpinus> just gotta be more patient
[3:41:49] <+athuramn> I'm kinda new to watching woolie not on YouTube, does he look to chat for info at times?
[3:41:58] <@Solidus_113> he tries not to
[3:42:00] <Hammatime8> @athuramn Not really
[3:42:13] <+athuramn> makes sense, ty @solidus_113 @hammatime8
[3:42:22] <sirmousehatter> nice
[3:42:30] <Hammatime8> Yeeea!
[3:42:55] <sirmousehatter> ooff
[3:42:59] <T_Sasquatch> @athuramn depends on the game but mostly
[3:43:10] <T_Sasquatch> yesnt
[3:43:10] <%SirGO0SE> this music makes me wish i was techno viking
[3:43:23] <%Arancet> nice guy aint he
[3:44:07] <sirmousehatter> oh wow, never knew the left path exists
[3:44:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:44:25] <Asuterisuku> It highlighted for a moment; I think you just ran out of meter.
[3:44:27] <KeiganOfAstora> Just got here. Is this game good or jank?
[3:44:28] <+athuramn> ty @t_sasquatch and ngl, this section made me think I was going nuts
[3:44:38] <Asuterisuku> Yes.
[3:44:45] <KeiganOfAstora> It's good jank?
[3:45:02] <+athuramn> games good, has some jank but also pretty polished considering studio size
[3:45:17] <KeiganOfAstora> Is Woolie just getting his parkour fix?
[3:45:18] <@Menitta> YAAAH
[3:46:26] <+Cuon_Alpinus> its good jank Keigan
[3:46:44] <+Cuon_Alpinus> just a lot more suffering on controller vs M+KB
[3:46:46] <KeiganOfAstora> I'll catch the YouTubes. Gives me something to watch
[3:47:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Is this a one-off or full LP?
[3:47:25] <%nicversus> haha jk.... unless?
[3:48:01] <%johnny_gogo> its for later
[3:48:08] <$emerald_poison> Yo this chat is so calm, woolie must be lost combing the place
[3:49:03] <+blastyoboots> ~
[3:49:21] <+athuramn> calm like water
[3:49:36] <T_Sasquatch> alotta silence LUL
[3:50:03] <sirmousehatter> it's environmental puzzle thinking time
[3:50:06] <+athuramn> speaking of, it's raining dicks outside right now so I'm down with this music and chill vibe
[3:50:13] <$emerald_poison> I think if you're into action games your life time wallrunning/grappling distance must of circled the earth at least once
[3:50:34] <%ihavesillyknees> ihavesillyknees subscribed at Tier 1.
[3:50:49] <+athuramn> I believe there's a distance tracker in tf2 for that
[3:51:19] <Asuterisuku> Can't get to it from here.
[3:51:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[3:51:30] <sirmousehatter> tbf this part is kinda unintuitive
[3:51:45] <+Cuon_Alpinus> speedrunner tech, you can just crouch on the corner of this one I tihnk
[3:51:47] <@Solidus_113> find a way back to the slow-mo
[3:51:48] <$emerald_poison> See i know you mean titan fall but tf2 stands for team fortress god dammit
[3:51:49] <Asuterisuku> I disagree. Woolie was on the correct path earlier, but then gave up on it.
[3:51:53] <+Cuon_Alpinus> to skip it
[3:52:03] <%AyotoCorp> psaBlind
[3:52:03] <+athuramn> follow lights and yellow paths
[3:52:31] <%johnny_gogo> just follow the upper path
[3:52:37] <Asuterisuku> This is not a Find the Path dungeon as Boss Keys would put it.

[3:54:45] <@Menitta> this enemy type.....does not fuck around
[3:54:59] <@Solidus_113> I could never anti-air them
[3:55:00] <Asuterisuku> They can fall into pits just like you can.
[3:55:00] <+athuramn> I have literally never seen them jump on the ceiling before
[3:55:08] <@Menitta> I tried so hard to anti-air them
[3:55:22] <sirmousehatter> doing anti air on them ja tough
[3:55:29] <$emerald_poison> Obvoiusly faint attcks to bait out the whiff punish
[3:55:30] <@Solidus_113> really hard to tell the actual sword range
[3:55:42] <Asuterisuku> Deflect timing better be on point.
[3:55:59] <sirmousehatter> you can dodge this
[3:56:00] <@Menitta> WHAT
[3:56:20] <@Menitta> oh no
[3:56:33] <$emerald_poison> LOL YOUR NAME IS JACK?
[3:56:43] <@Menitta> sure is
[3:56:43] <+burntbagels13> if. its radiation wont they just die of cancer in five years now anyways?
[3:56:51] <+athuramn> shhh
[3:57:00] <+athuramn> we're past logic
[3:57:13] <%AyotoCorp> Is Woolie's camera blinking black on occasion for anyone else?
[3:57:18] <@Solidus_113> it is
[3:57:24] <+Cuon_Alpinus> You can slide-jump like in titanfall/Apex for a big speed boost
[3:57:36] <+athuramn> THATS THE RUN THAT WORKED?
[3:57:53] <$emerald_poison> Where are the homing cyber ninja stars? Or are you super early?
[3:58:02] <@Solidus_113> a little too early
[3:58:11] <@Menitta> YOU CAN ANTI AIR THEM
[3:58:18] <@Menitta> WHAT
[3:58:22] <+Cuon_Alpinus> ye
[3:58:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:58:26] <%AyotoCorp> Oh this room
[3:58:38] <@Solidus_113> Schmoove
[3:58:42] <%AyotoCorp> This room is going to take a minute
[3:58:43] <%nicversus> big whiff
[3:58:57] <%AyotoCorp> Or not
[3:58:59] <+athuramn> there are these moments of success that they have where I'm like "that worked?"
[3:59:20] <%johnny_gogo> ITEM IN THIS ROOM
[4:00:01] <+Cuon_Alpinus> remember you can dash into wallruns
[4:00:14] <Asuterisuku> It's going to MAKE you do that on the way back.
[4:00:28] <$emerald_poison> Cheer500 what is this guy doing with his other hand?
[4:00:46] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:00:49] <%Arancet> making naruto signs
[4:00:52] <+athuramn> he's making hand signs for all his jutsus
[4:00:58] <%johnny_gogo> no wall run jump then dash to the other side
[4:01:00] <+athuramn> YEAAAHH @arancet
[4:01:04] <@Solidus_113> well, just jump off
[4:01:05] <+Cuon_Alpinus> just normal jump
[4:01:32] <noizaf> wallrun than dash to wallrun works too
[4:01:44] <@Solidus_113> another fun room
[4:01:46] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:01:48] <+Cuon_Alpinus> this roooom
[4:01:51] <+athuramn> but what @cuon_alpinus said is mad important too that I noticed they haven't been doing much of
[4:01:53] <Asuterisuku> Yeah, he thinks.
[4:01:53] <%ChoculaUltra> has woolie found any of the dope secret swords and shit lying around?
[4:01:55] <@Menitta> oh god this room
[4:02:03] <Meltgar> Oh it was one shot 1 kill? dang
[4:02:05] <%johnny_gogo> PSA FUCK THIS ROOm
[4:02:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah this room is rough
[4:02:24] <+athuramn> and yet...
[4:02:28] <%johnny_gogo> he got it
[4:02:34] <%Jetzord> fucking clean
[4:02:37] <Asuterisuku> Third try.
[4:02:37] <Meltgar> CLEAN CITY
[4:02:40] <%nicversus> juicy
[4:02:41] <+Cuon_Alpinus> speedrun strats
[4:02:47] <@Menitta> yeah!
[4:02:48] <%AyotoCorp> Conversation skip tech
[4:02:58] <@Menitta> die to get to the checkpoint faster
[4:03:04] <$emerald_poison> This would be a cool game to switch on deatn
[4:03:26] <Asuterisuku> This isn't backtracking.
[4:03:29] <%johnny_gogo> thats not the way you came in
[4:03:30] <Asuterisuku> Yet.
[4:03:37] <+Cuon_Alpinus> if you die after completing a room, it sends you to the door
[4:03:46] <%nicversus> I like how the game couldn't conceive of you dying there so it didn't save your spot in the convo
[4:03:54] <@Menitta> LMAO
[4:04:08] <+athuramn> lmaol
[4:04:17] <+Cuon_Alpinus> you'v already done harder areas, you're just getting used to it and consistently improving
[4:04:19] <%nicversus> to defend them from their enemies
[4:04:42] <%nicversus> "I can avoid you"[CITATION NEEDED]
[4:05:13] <Asuterisuku> But what if you're hacking a smart fridge to serve as a surveillance device?
[4:05:21] <+athuramn> these are going relatively well because he's choosing his path but the sentrys are gonna throw a wrench into things
[4:05:36] <Asuterisuku> New move new move
[4:05:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:05:41] <+athuramn> oh no, garbage
[4:05:42] <%AyotoCorp> Oh this part
[4:05:42] <@Solidus_113> more puzzles
[4:05:46] <+Cuon_Alpinus> alright are y'all ready for this fuckin PUZZLE
[4:05:47] <%johnny_gogo> BABY PUZZLE TIME
[4:06:11] <Asuterisuku> Looks like a current puzzle.
[4:06:20] <sirmousehatter> this took me an embarrassing amount of tries to get
[4:06:31] <%nicversus> not much of a puzzle
[4:06:34] <+Cuon_Alpinus> sit back and relax chat
[4:06:38] <$emerald_poison> you play much Shadow Warrior? reminds me a bit of the second one, more intense of course
[4:06:40] <+Cuon_Alpinus> we're gonna be here for a while
[4:06:43] <%nicversus> oh that was round one
[4:06:51] <+athuramn> OH NO BUT THERES MOREEE, I'm PuZzLleDdd
[4:07:04] <%nicversus> Puzzles of Tron
[4:07:21] <+athuramn> this game could do with a lightcycle tbh
[4:07:29] <+athuramn> would be rad
[4:08:00] <@Solidus_113> when the connecting lines touch they turn everything
[4:08:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @emerald_poison
[4:08:39] <%johnny_gogo> the connector make it so they all spin
[4:08:56] <$emerald_poison> ahh a caps warning. alright I'll hold the hype
[4:08:57] <+Cuon_Alpinus> NotLikeThis
[4:09:06] <dinnydanny777> This area is gorgeous
[4:09:44] <%AyotoCorp> This puzzle kind of sucks because it's not clear which lines connect
[4:09:52] <%johnny_gogo> the hypest puzzle solving on youtube
[4:10:01] <+athuramn> and so plot relevant. don't we all love how the architect made little baby puzzles in this incredibly complex piece of machinery
[4:10:15] <+Cuon_Alpinus> this is a mind-palace
[4:10:19] <%ChoculaUltra> I know this is a cold take but - Ghostrunner did the whole cyberpunk-vibe better than Cyberpunk did.
[4:10:21] <+Cuon_Alpinus> they're logic puzzles because it's code
[4:10:45] <%0rond> so close
[4:10:48] <mrpandabear437> @athuramn hey man, its keeping woolie out so far
[4:11:10] <%Arancet> all safes are rated time to crack after all
[4:11:33] <$emerald_poison> Classic game design, you can make a puzzle, but you have to make sure you can almost solve it with randomly pressing button
[4:11:42] <+athuramn> @mrpandabear437 it actually stings to know how right you are right now LOL
[4:12:10] <%johnny_gogo> so close
[4:12:46] <%nicversus> he sees the code
[4:12:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:12:52] <Asuterisuku> That was more of a puzzle.
[4:13:02] <$emerald_poison> He holds the sword up this whole time, so it's like he's fighting the puzzle
[4:13:39] <Asuterisuku> You're presently at two times focus gain.
[4:13:48] <%andrewofbob> He's seeking the Dante method of doing the dice puzzle
[4:13:50] <Nightwingie> SourPls
[4:13:51] <+athuramn> "I'm gonna make you so advanced and modular, it'll be like tetris "
[4:13:58] <%johnny_gogo> its still very early in the game as well
[4:14:17] <@Solidus_113> nope
[4:14:21] <%johnny_gogo> no
[4:14:22] <Asuterisuku> So yeah, now you go back the way you came.
[4:14:26] <%johnny_gogo> a little more
[4:14:28] <$emerald_poison> Hey don't underestimate tetris
[4:14:36] <%AyotoCorp> You can see just how early in the game it is by the amount of space left in the upgrade grid
[4:15:06] <%andrewofbob> And from the collectables list
[4:15:32] <Asuterisuku> You're definitely not fitting all possible upgrades on the grid.
[4:15:48] <%AyotoCorp> Remember that one level in Titanfall 2?
[4:15:50] <Asuterisuku> Other Ghostrunners?
[4:16:05] <+athuramn> with all the houses and environments being built?
[4:16:30] <$emerald_poison> atpChar
[4:16:38] <blackkanye> @athuramn Yeah I get vibes from that level for this
[4:17:12] <@Solidus_113> this level is all backtracking now
[4:17:18] <+athuramn> yeee, all those suspiciously placed platforms
[4:17:28] <Asuterisuku> They will both kill you.
[4:17:42] <Asuterisuku> Grapple point.
[4:17:50] <Tisaric> ???
[4:18:06] <Asuterisuku> Reggie says while looking at the door with the yellow marker.
[4:18:30] <Asuterisuku> Incoming Vergil
[4:19:17] <+Cuon_Alpinus> titanfall this baybeee
[4:19:37] <$emerald_poison> So all these different attempts from Woolz are calculated projections of the cyber ninja and canonical never dies through the game right?
[4:19:38] <Asuterisuku> As a Talim main, I approve, Reggie.
[4:20:14] <+athuramn> it's ghostrunner in tight spaces
[4:20:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1386952720297381894?s=19
[4:20:43] <%johnny_gogo> theres a item in this room to the left of where you spawn
[4:20:48] <+athuramn> oh this area
[4:21:09] <%andrewofbob> Sometimes these death planes are too low
[4:21:20] <Asuterisuku> These ones are too high though.
[4:21:56] <%johnny_gogo> you cant really reflect machinegun guys bullets
[4:22:25] <Asuterisuku> You can probably deflect the first, but then you're in recovery frames when the second one hits.
[4:22:35] <%andrewofbob> @Asuterisuku Yeah, that's actually what I meant
[4:22:41] <%johnny_gogo> well its more of you cant look at them to aim
[4:22:59] <stevenellis386> only the best ninjas don't have to stealth
[4:22:59] <kingfunkybones> the music do go off
[4:23:30] <+athuramn> you can totally do it
[4:23:42] <@Solidus_113> look around more
[4:23:42] <+athuramn> mind over matter really
[4:23:52] <+athuramn> persistence is key!
[4:24:18] <stevenellis386> player smarter not harder

[4:25:28] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:25:29] <%johnny_gogo> So full LP?
[4:25:34] <%nicversus> 208, A NEW RECORD
[4:25:38] <Asuterisuku> NOW you're farther than Pat.
[4:25:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[4:25:44] <huskarl_zap> sure
[4:25:46] <%SirGO0SE> psaPat
[4:25:48] <SenpaiMD> 1 hour???
[4:25:49] <%andrewofbob> ONE PART
[4:25:54] <Asuterisuku> Solidus died more than Rocca but still got there faster.
[4:25:59] <sirmousehatter> Man, I wish the swords are easier to get in this game
[4:26:09] <+wah_ha_ha> Farther than Pat LUL
[4:26:12] <+Cuon_Alpinus> and on m+kb
[4:26:19] <@Solidus_113> I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG
[4:26:19] <Tisaric> Play this on KBM
[4:26:23] <arashi_icemaster> that bad on console?
[4:26:27] <@Solidus_113> THIS WHOLE OST
[4:26:29] <@Solidus_113> JUST FIRE
[4:26:30] <%radregice> soundtrack's also on spotify!
[4:26:33] <+athuramn> Controller hurts different
[4:26:34] <Tisaric> it's really not meant to be played on a controller
[4:26:38] <@Menitta> the soundtrack is by Daniel Deluxe and it's FIRE
[4:26:41] <%nicversus> Good shit, Woolie! woolieGLORY
[4:26:46] <SenpaiMD> @arashi_icemaster yeah, they fudged the controls
[4:26:47] <+Cuon_Alpinus> @arashi_icemaster it's almost unplayable on console due to the weird controller settings
[4:26:49] <%SirGO0SE> Clap nice job
[4:26:54] <$emerald_poison> Think about it. Analog in a accuracy FPS
[4:26:55] <+Cuon_Alpinus> PC controller is fine though
[4:26:58] <%radregice> very cool
[4:27:04] <DaKnightWarrior> Fun stream.
[4:27:13] <%andrewofbob> It takes a lot to get Woolie to back down
[4:27:21] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Now go watch a speedrun and let your mind melt. Even just a couple minutes pleassseee
[4:27:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:27:48] <@Solidus_113> I think this level is the one you get the shuriken in too
[4:28:01] <+athuramn> yeah a spe3d
[4:28:13] <+athuramn> speed run is slick to watch
[4:28:20] <Asuterisuku> A shame about that one early room though.
[4:28:22] <sirmousehatter> ghostrunner speed runs are beautiful
[4:28:28] <+athuramn> well....
[4:28:29] <%johnny_gogo> yeah
[4:28:37] <%Afterman_> depends how fast you pick it up? idk i havent played
[4:28:40] <+Cuon_Alpinus> shuriken lets you spam it on a timer, but it's a ground pickup like the timeslow
[4:28:40] <Tisaric> it's like the time slow, it's a timed buff
[4:28:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> its like time slow
[4:29:01] <%johnny_gogo> its like picking up the time stop
[4:29:07] <+athuramn> so it can be used to clear but that's not intended design
[4:29:21] <Tisaric> it doesn't slow down the world but it's timed like time stop
[4:29:22] <SenpaiMD> No. its a powerup like timestop
[4:29:24] <%johnny_gogo> its like picking up the power up my bad
[4:29:29] <@Solidus_113> you get like 10 seconds of shuriken time
[4:29:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no sorry i mean it's like time slow in the sense that you pick it up my b
[4:29:52] <%johnny_gogo> i feel your exhaustion
[4:30:00] <%johnny_gogo> this game is alot
[4:30:02] <+Cuon_Alpinus> now watch a speedrun up to where you stopped. Don't worry it's only like 5 minutesLUL
[4:30:04] <+athuramn> that was a great stream fellas, appreciated it 👍
[4:30:18] <%johnny_gogo> alot more game
[4:30:34] <DaKnightWarrior> 5 hours went quick.
[4:30:52] <+athuramn> a lot more game but once you get more of the fundamentals, you can breeze through the game
[4:31:39] <Asuterisuku> Like if you could buy in to upgrades.
[4:31:45] <+athuramn> bless you, I think
[4:32:24] <%andrewofbob> It does engourage you to try everything at least once
[4:32:48] <+trackles_64> Here we go again

[4:34:56] <Hammatime8> I think Titanfall 2 actually has per-button remapping?
[4:34:58] <%nicversus> yeah, it usually wraps up around 5:30-6
[4:35:07] <+athuramn> tbh, I was wondering if there's a qa explanation for why remapping isn't just universal at this point
[4:35:14] <@Solidus_113> I thought Titanfall 2 did that big controller update? you could customize everything, including deadzones
[4:35:23] <Hammatime8> At least, it does on PS4
[4:35:39] <sirmousehatter> it's especially frustrating when the game is entirely single player
[4:35:51] <xxshadowxx416> @woolieversus titanfall 2 campaign
