[0:01:21] <andre11dr> @k1llw1n You say that, but this will end around 3 am for us LUL
[0:01:22] <ThatChainmecha> I'm just vibing. Was supposed to be in New York, instead im just buying Chinese food
[0:01:26] <youngking_kush> Same
[0:01:28] <@Solidus_113> play fusion
[0:01:29] <@Menitta> Start with Super yeah
[0:01:30] <jorniev> PRIME  didnt age that good
[0:01:37] <%holydeviant1> Prime is very different, it makes for a good bbreak between traditional ones.
[0:01:44] <@Menitta> prime ages incredibly well on Wii
[0:01:48] <youngking_kush> Zero Mission & Fusion are the best IMO
[0:01:49] <sirjames079> I replayed Prime last year, had a hella good time with it
[0:01:56] <Arqartur0> @ThatChainmecha That's... A big loop XD, unless you live close to NY.
[0:01:59] <+TheScorpionEater> dark souls remastered is still $20 on steam Sadge
[0:01:59] <%leith_aziz> Quality in different areas. That's what makes both great in different ways
[0:02:04] <Lowwii> Lowwii subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:02:06] <@Menitta> I just beat Prime 3 this weekend
[0:02:08] <SivSarcast> Ah, got it. Thanks.
[0:02:12] <@Menitta> that game is dope
[0:02:13] <jorniev> PRIME 1 didnt age nearly as good as prime 2
[0:02:17] <Johannen> So how about that Doom 64 context?
[0:02:25] <ThatChainmecha> I live kinda close @Arqartur0 but Covid is kinda crazy in Manhattan
[0:02:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:02:25] <andre11dr> Prime was  for Metroid what RE4 was for RE
[0:02:27] <HelghastTroop> you know someone that calls her Same-us
[0:02:29] <@Menitta> Oh naw I disagree prime 2 is a huge step down imo
[0:02:30] <HelghastTroop> fuck those guys
[0:02:50] <Arqartur0> @ThatChainmecha Ahh, I see. Sad to know, my brother is in Queens atm.
[0:02:56] <%leith_aziz> @Menitta Im curious why. I thought they were pretty similar
[0:02:58] <SivSarcast> Duly noted. I'll keep an eye out for Super.
[0:03:08] <youngking_kush> Zero Mission is the shit man, love that game
[0:03:09] <kjb343> sanctuary fortress is the best area in any metroid game
[0:03:12] <%cubbywolf> L E T S G O D E M O N S ! ! ! !
[0:03:19] <@Menitta> Super is the answer because the GBA games have a lot more fluid controls and Super is harder to go back to imo
[0:03:22] <ThatChainmecha> Is Dread worth the 60 dollars? I just bought a switch for SMTV
[0:03:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ThatChainmecha i think so
[0:03:34] <%cubbywolf> D E M E N O N S! What does that spell! DEATH!
[0:03:36] <Bromosap1ens> New players will take awhile to get through though. People forget how long those games can be if you don't know where to go
[0:03:37] <%Xaeveax> Super is really hard to go back to after Dread. I tried it recently and couldn't.
[0:03:39] <%leith_aziz> @ThatChainmecha I heard its amazing, so that's up to you
[0:03:44] <%cubbywolf> LUL demenons
[0:03:46] <@Solidus_113> Super, Zero Mission, Fusion, then Primes
[0:03:48] <@Menitta> prime 2 is still good, it's just got some weird design decisions with the dark world and use of ammo I really don't like
[0:03:53] <youngking_kush> Yall think my 9 y.o. nephew could play Dread?
[0:03:55] <Johannen> @ThatChainmecha Just get Hollow Knight)
[0:04:03] <youngking_kush> I wanna buy it on his Switch lol
[0:04:06] <jorniev> Seriously, it's not a bad game by other margins, but I really don't like how prime controls. are they ever remastering the prime games?
[0:04:12] <andre11dr> Man i still need to sit down an actually finish SMT V
[0:04:13] <%Xaeveax> @youngking_kush It's hard for sure, but it's possible if they have patience to learn it.
[0:04:19] <%leith_aziz> Unleashed and Generations are great.
[0:04:36] <+RyTYoung> Every night I'm doing a demonic ritual with all my 3D sonic games that I own so Frontiers can be good NotLikeThis
[0:04:41] <@Menitta> Prime 1 and 2 are best on Wii. I'll die on that hill. it's my favorite game depending on the day.
[0:04:50] <%Xaeveax> @RyTYoung It will never be enough.
[0:04:54] <%leith_aziz> @Menitta Does it depend on controlls?

[0:05:47] <Johannen> Can we shame Woolie into playing Beyond G&E?
[0:05:48] <jackelzxaa> Woolie did you ever play AM2R or Prime2D's demo?  Both of them were interesting takes on doing scanning in 2d metroid
[0:05:58] <@Menitta> @leith_aziz The original controls are weird with Prime. You can't aim and move independently. With the Wii controls you can move and look around more akin to a modern first person game
[0:05:59] <%leith_aziz> @Johannen How is that "shame"?
[0:06:03] <+Mrbaconator> i already did @WoolieVersus
[0:06:04] <DextralMalin> I actually do need to look into getting a new computer.  my laptop is getting old
[0:06:10] <Futurecity10> yes
[0:06:13] <@Menitta> @bromosap1ens lmao I haven't
[0:06:16] <CoffeeSlice> it's SUPER average
[0:06:17] <+TheScorpionEater> yeah it was ok
[0:06:20] <@Menitta> sounds awesome though
[0:06:24] <%strakillias> Yes that is normal
[0:06:27] <derap41> All Marvel movies are average
[0:06:30] <sirjames079> Far From Home kinda sucked
[0:06:31] <Treasure_Vault> I can't remember anything from the second one
[0:06:33] <youngking_kush> I like the 2nd one better, and feel that way about Homecoming
[0:06:34] <%Indigo_Automaton> Mysterio was great but the rest was okay
[0:06:34] <@Menitta> Homecoming was better for sure
[0:06:34] <JdotSweapA> they both....meh
[0:06:36] <Johannen> @leith_aziz Cause he didnt played it thru and recently that was brought up on the podcast that he is a fraud
[0:06:36] <+Mrbaconator> i liked the 2nd one a lot
[0:06:37] <mikesapartment> i'd say i like mysterio more
[0:06:37] <%Pillagius> you need to watch spiderman 1,2,3 and 1, 2 and 1 and 2 to understand spiderman 3
[0:06:39] <+TheScorpionEater> LOKI RULES THO
[0:06:44] <Bromosap1ens> You would be right.  @Menitta
[0:06:44] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! 
[0:06:44] <+RyTYoung> Was Jake Gyllenhal good as Mysterio?
[0:06:47] <JdotSweapA> heard no way home is sick
[0:06:48] <ChoculaUltra> MCU movie standards have ruined modern movie discourse full stop.
[0:06:50] <andre11dr> The second one was pretty average, tho some cool powers where showed
[0:06:55] <+Mrbaconator> jake gyllenhal was phenomenal as mysterio
[0:06:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> His mocap suit is so cool
[0:06:58] <@Menitta> FFH was weird. it had pacing issues imo
[0:06:58] <@Solidus_113> it was real good
[0:07:01] <%leith_aziz> I think tahat's very up in the air from everyone I see. Some prefer Far From Home over Homecoming, and vice verca
[0:07:03] <%jamsbybetty> FFH teen stuff is really bland but the Mysterio stuff is really good, so it kinda balances out into kind of an average movie
[0:07:03] <+Mrbaconator> source mysterio is just a clown
[0:07:10] <%leith_aziz> But yeah, Mysterio was great
[0:07:15] <@Solidus_113> Mysterio is always a fake and a clown
[0:07:16] <%Xaeveax> @ChoculaUltra Fully agree. Cinema would have been better off without the MCU.
[0:07:16] <%kewlmyc> I liked Mysterio, but didn't like him being tied to Stark yet again
[0:07:21] <+swesterly> The illusion sequences were fucking cool
[0:07:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sirjames079
[0:07:32] <Hozak> Though he does totally defeat Wolverine in Old Man Logan
[0:07:36] <+Mrbaconator> tom holland mysterio is SUPER good
[0:07:42] <+Mrbaconator> he's terrifying in a non physical way
[0:07:50] <sirjames079> I absolutely wanted the dumbass with a dome on his head, new Mysterio was lame
[0:07:57] <youngking_kush> Yeah new Spider-Man is good guys, worth it
[0:08:03] <mikesapartment> I clapped!
[0:08:03] <+RyTYoung> I'm going to be trying to go through the marvel movies I haven't seen over the Christmas period, which is probably around 29 movies csbeastSetIn
[0:08:04] <ChoculaUltra> @Xaeveax LUL I wouldn't say that - some of the Marvel movies are genuinely good. It's the weird putting-them-on-a-pedestal vibe that surrounds the entire MCU that I absolutely loathe.
[0:08:13] <andre11dr> My problem with homecoming is that it takes Spidey way to long to stop the powers ,like com you should be smarter than that
[0:08:13] <SQDizzy> i think i get what you mean
[0:08:18] <+Mrbaconator> i liked the new movie. it has plotholes though that i won't specify
[0:08:21] <youngking_kush> No Way Home spoilercast?
[0:08:23] <emptyantics> Just here to remind you Spiderverse is the best Spider-Man film ever created
[0:08:26] <%leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra If you think that's the case, then wouldnt it be better to, I dont know, NOT watch MCU movies? pickyShrug
[0:08:33] <%leith_aziz> Spoilers?
[0:08:36] <+RyTYoung> @emptyantics yeyeyeye
[0:08:43] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you should watch The Suicide Squad at some point.
[0:08:53] <+lag2993> idk the art for spiderverse is godlike but everything else is meh
[0:08:57] <%JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus you hear about the FF6 pixel remaster coming out in February?
[0:08:58] <+Mrbaconator> are we some kind of The Suicide Squad
[0:09:02] <@Menitta> The last thing I learned about NWH was if it was good and that's frustrating to me.
[0:09:03] <+TheScorpionEater> most of them of not amazing but they're at least watchable

[0:09:32] <Arqartur0> I still liked the Animated Spiderverse movie, though. But yeah, Dr. Strange is great.
[0:09:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I stopped at the first Strange movie, but I guess it's nice people are enjoying it
[0:09:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hey new Doctor Strange trailer dropped today if you care about trailers
[0:09:56] <Arqartur0> Also, Daredevil... I want to see if they remake Iron Fist.
[0:09:57] <youngking_kush> Strange is really growing on me after bring lukewarm on him
[0:10:01] <%MooseIsGoose> Yeah new trailer is out.
[0:10:07] <@Menitta> OOF
[0:10:11] <%leith_aziz> Im not a guy who binge-watches MCU movies or cares about the "standards" of movies nowadays. I can just say that some of those movies are genuinely great, so I dont really care at the end of the day I guess. I havent watched MCU in a while
[0:10:14] <%patriotrenegade> lol
[0:10:14] <youngking_kush> Big OOF
[0:10:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no
[0:10:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LMAO bad pick buddy
[0:10:20] <@Solidus_113> My first FF game was 13-2
[0:10:22] <dalmek> entering Metal Gear with Survive
[0:10:23] <@Menitta> That's rough lmao
[0:10:34] <morphius95> mine was fate extra......good game tho
[0:10:35] <+lag2993> ooof x2 but why the sequel to the tenth iteration of a series
[0:10:37] <+VictorVonLouche> X-2 is a fun game though lol
[0:10:38] <linSP> Start at FFXIII 3
[0:10:39] <jackelzxaa> ff13-2 is very good
[0:10:46] <andre11dr> X2 is the prime example of good gameplay, TERRIBLE STORY
[0:10:47] <Arqartur0> Starting Metal Gear with Revengeance XD
[0:10:51] <%Xaeveax> Imagine starting with Dark Souls II, wouldn't that be crazy.
[0:10:52] <%holydeviant1> X-2 good mechanically, and extra good if you're a teenage boy
[0:10:56] <justlikehumans> first metal gear game being mgr is wild
[0:11:01] <+xpakeo> best ff start is 16
[0:11:04] <%Lion_kun> Play Nioh 2
[0:11:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Start at World of Final Fantasy
[0:11:06] <blackskulldragon18> Started at FF8 and it was something
[0:11:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Arqartur0 ...that's... the only one i've played...
[0:11:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ff13-2 is super fun to play but the story and dialogue is peak cringe lol
[0:11:06] <Hozak> Apparently the FF7 remake pc port is pretty busted
[0:11:08] <%leith_aziz> @Arqartur0 Dude, everyone loves Into the Spider-verse
[0:11:11] <jackelzxaa> my first mgs was 2 which meant i was VERY confused
[0:11:20] <+pectusumbra> Here's hoping they pick the GBA/PSP versions for the update
[0:11:22] <BettyMwwaahh> my first metal gear game was also Rising
[0:11:22] <Arqartur0> @Arqartur0 yup
[0:11:23] <jackelzxaa> "What the hell is shadow moses?"
[0:11:24] <linSP> The new remasters are a great place to start, they made FF1 fun
[0:11:26] <youngking_kush> NO YOU DONT
[0:11:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Skip Nioh 1 it's way worse
[0:11:35] <youngking_kush> NIOH 1 IS A MIND GOBLIN
[0:11:38] <%holydeviant1> It is a prequel, sooooo
[0:11:40] <@Menitta> I finished Nioh 2 at 135 hours
[0:11:40] <Bromosap1ens> Pshhhh
[0:11:42] <+atmosqortz> Damn reggie lookin kind of MOTIVATED today
[0:11:42] <%Lion_kun> Pat is gonna tell you to skip 1 next podcast lol
[0:11:45] <ericbritsman> half life w
[0:11:46] <+lag2993> nioh 1 is great but there is a game breaking bug at the final boss that just stopped me from completing it
[0:11:49] <@Menitta> so yeah that'd be a lot
[0:11:52] <jackelzxaa> play dark souls 3
[0:11:55] <%Xaeveax> Nioh is so grindy. I got so bored of Nioh 1 and couldn't finish it.
[0:11:55] <Arqartur0> Starting DMC with DMC Dino would be bad,
[0:11:57] <JdotSweapA> hahahaha
[0:11:57] <+Lordgale119> Nioh 1 is fun, people who say you don't are talking about mechanics
[0:11:58] <%patriotrenegade> what??
[0:11:58] <Treasure_Vault> Nioh 2 makes Nioh 1 look like Kings Field
[0:11:59] <Afrosamasenpai> damn
[0:11:59] <OldManDeckardCain> nioh 2 has dempsey rolls LUL
[0:12:00] <%Rasheedt> LUL
[0:12:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no way
[0:12:01] <%leith_aziz> Woolie is not Pat confirmed
[0:12:02] <+RyTYoung> Nioh 1 is good to go through
[0:12:05] <%livlinn> psaWhat
[0:12:06] <JdotSweapA> Nioh 1s fun
[0:12:06] <+Jasek7> just summon folks for help and blow thru it
[0:12:07] <OblivionSword1> Nioh 1 is still fun
[0:12:07] <ApollosAnimation> Not Pat? D:
[0:12:08] <%Bread_Assassin> Elden Ring stream confirmed?
[0:12:09] <Wisconsinite> you're not? than who is this?
[0:12:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you REALLY SHOULD finish Nioh 1 and either on your own time or on stream go to 2
[0:12:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Think about how much more you'll enjoy the better one tho LUL
[0:12:14] <+LeRouch_the_Rebel> Play Nioh 1 Chat, is good game
[0:12:15] <%Prevot> woolie has mind kobolds guys, not mind goblins
[0:12:15] <%Pillagius> Well, yeah... now it's not a good time to start NIoh 2.
[0:12:16] <Zebroneath> Nioh 1 has cool shit
[0:12:17] <@Menitta> Nioh 1 is good
[0:12:18] <Valentine_Evelyn> wait your not pat??
[0:12:18] <jackelzxaa> i dunno woolie might still be pat, they've never been in the same place at the same time
[0:12:19] <Bromosap1ens> Nioh 1 makes Nioh 2 better. Nioh 2 pays off really nicely if you're a Nioh 1 guy
[0:12:22] <%Vigonept> what. why dont you do what i want woolie?
[0:12:23] <%ozzrabbit> Play FFIV
[0:12:23] <BettyMwwaahh> quit having fun!
[0:12:25] <%livlinn> psaWhat woolieVS psaGoblin
[0:12:26] <+K1LLW1N> skip
[0:12:27] <Burgleman> i thought Woolie was Pat and Pat was also Pat
[0:12:28] <+TossuDa> mind kobolds
[0:12:31] <+pectusumbra> Fair enough. But 2 is amazing
[0:12:33] <%holydeviant1> @Prevot More charming but ultimately more dangerous?
[0:12:33] <%Pillagius> You could at least finish Nioh 1 :D
[0:12:34] <Burgleman> my immersion is now broken forever
[0:12:36] <+LeRouch_the_Rebel> YASUKE IS IN NIOH !
[0:12:37] <Arqartur0> I can't hear/read Nio without thiking of anime NYAN
[0:12:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Are you sure.....
[0:12:39] <OblivionSword1> while Nioh 2 is better Nioh 1 is still solid and fun
[0:12:40] <+Lordgale119> Nioh 1 is a fun game with a fun story and gameplay, Nioh 2 is just better, and better enjoyed if you've played 1.
[0:12:40] <foghornleghorn55> Woolie not backing down
[0:12:43] <jackelzxaa> Woolie did you ever play Dark Souls 3 after the playthrough since you were on the commentary for that LP?
[0:12:44] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Just so you know Nioh 1 DLC assumes you do it in NG+ and goes hard
[0:12:50] <rosemon5001> pat goblins make him miss out stuff more than not
[0:12:55] <+swesterly> Are you guys planning on skipping DS2?
[0:12:55] <@Menitta> Nah. 2 is definitely better in mostly every way but don't skip 1
[0:12:56] <youngking_kush> It is a big game for sure
[0:12:58] <Bonebagmel> Nioh 2 is not going anywhere.
[0:12:59] <Seithri> What ? I thought I was watching pat. You two look identical.
[0:13:01] <+Lordgale119> there's no FOMO if it's a game you can play whenever you want
[0:13:06] <%leith_aziz> Look, even if Nioh 2 is better, playing the predecessor is still a better choice because it makes you notice the improvment in quality between games
[0:13:14] <+Xeogred> I think Nioh 1 had a darker atmosphere and cooler levels at times. But yeah 2 is just sublime gameplay wise
[0:13:21] <+Lordgale119> Nioh 2 also assumes you've played Nioh 1
[0:13:21] <%Lion_kun> Nioh 2 DLC is thankfully balanced normally unlike 1
[0:13:24] <youngking_kush> Nioh 2 is made to invalidate Nioh 1
[0:13:25] <+LeRouch_the_Rebel> Woolie hasn't even gotten to Yasuke I bet
[0:13:26] <BlackermanZX> so how bout that P4U rollback
[0:13:31] <he1lhydra> HahaShrugLeft thatsp34Jarakune HahaShrugRight
[0:13:34] <youngking_kush> It's a prequel and everything
[0:13:34] <+Shishi1205> rip about ff6
[0:13:34] <+vvitchguy> I like the orange and green wires on the mics.

[0:14:11] <ArvidOnFire> ! CHAOS KILLED !
[0:14:11] <ChoculaUltra> "considering rollback implementation for a future patch" is a no buy for 90% of the fgc lmao
[0:14:11] <+Shishi1205> it might also be bc I went full axes tho
[0:14:12] <jackelzxaa> kill spider wife to get her fire keeper soul and feed it to the other one
[0:14:12] <Hozak> I was playing Dark SOuls and I randomized it but then made every enemy Seath the Scaleless and it turned into a screaming nightmare.
[0:14:13] <Wisconsinite> that armor looks sick!
[0:14:13] <%holydeviant1> Well, home stretch-ish, if you're doing DLC
[0:14:15] <Zetchryn> Oh wow... Is Woolie taking someone ELSE through their first time?
[0:14:15] <+Lordgale119> Nioh 1's DLC is fucking WILD

[0:14:53] <Zetchryn> It's so wild seeing Woolie acting as the guide
[0:14:56] <%Lion_kun> Which is worse, Dragon God or BoC?
[0:15:02] <blue_grave> has reggie done the dlc?
[0:15:02] <youngking_kush> We killed Chaos, now let's kill Death
[0:15:04] <urkleturtle> tomb of the DARKNESS
[0:15:06] <%kewlmyc> Damn, I missed chaos
[0:15:06] <BlackermanZX> oh god reggie killed chaos?
[0:15:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Boc

[0:15:10] <jackelzxaa> bed of chaos is worse because you can't really learn her

[0:15:25] <%Lion_kun> Put on the glow helmet
[0:15:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Tomb of Bad Times
[0:15:31] <%Xaeveax> Fear not the dark my friend, and let the fest begin.
[0:15:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Spooky Scary Skeletons
[0:15:39] <legacy0117> At least Reggie didn’t die at pinwheel.
[0:15:39] <Bromosap1ens> @jackelzxaa The reload exploit is how you "learn" that fight lol
[0:15:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Bonetrussel.mp3
[0:15:42] <LunarRemix> He now gets to appreciate Lost Izalith down there
[0:15:43] <%leith_aziz> @ChoculaUltra If they want you to buy it for them to consider, then yeah they wont buy it. If it's planned nontheless, they'll just wait. Rollback is all they ask for.

[0:17:22] <youngking_kush> Hes so strong lol
[0:17:22] <%Xaeveax> He's gonna storm through this easily.
[0:17:23] <jackelzxaa> Patches is Bean Dad

[0:17:58] <+POUND_CAKE94> Reggae that is fkn doing it
[0:18:00] <%Hapsam> reggie is the spooky skeleton in these tombs
[0:18:01] <Darren716> Sorceties are about working smarter, not harder
[0:18:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> get super cocky
[0:18:04] <%Xaeveax> We're totally finishing the base game today.
[0:18:07] <klooswep> It really is a good decision to do Tomb of the Giants last when you're strong enough to one- or two-shot the enemies
[0:18:09] <%MajorCrasher> there's another bonfire tho
[0:18:09] <%aram909> hes also like 40 levels higher
[0:18:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> let your ego grow out of control
[0:18:21] <+Shishi1205> Chat did we buy the soul spears
[0:18:23] <%holydeviant1> It's almost like you're meant to be hilariusly OP by the time you cap off the game or something
[0:18:23] <+Shishi1205> ?
[0:18:31] <youngking_kush> We gonna go Human for Ledo?
[0:18:36] <%Rasheedt> @shishi1205 yes
[0:18:40] <+Shishi1205> Ok
[0:18:42] <blackskulldragon18> wooliePOYO_HF He will have an easier time with it
[0:18:43] <Bromosap1ens> Playing a Paladin Leeroy cosplay and guiding people through TotG was some of the best co-op in this game
[0:18:43] <OblivionSword1> @Shishi1205 bought  both
[0:18:46] <+POUND_CAKE94> Reggie must fight artorias like this
[0:18:47] <jackelzxaa> i always do bed of chaos last because being op doesn't matter for that one
[0:18:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Silver Serpent is located to the right of the skeleton archer, requires a jump/roll
[0:18:49] <+Shishi1205> Memory is foggy
[0:18:52] <%Lion_kun> They fix this in later games
[0:18:55] <+Shishi1205> Too much bs
[0:18:57] <jackelzxaa> and also because it sucks and is the worst boss
[0:19:02] <%Lion_kun> You can warp and nor sit
[0:19:06] <%Rojahh> Remember paladin
[0:19:06] <+Shishi1205> @Johannen yeah
[0:19:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:19:09] <mikesapartment> mama mia
[0:19:09] <%Prevot> people are gonna be pretty salty when reggie wrecks that first dlc boss
[0:19:11] <+cdrom321> @derap41 Supposedly, Woolie did a Magic build in DS2 before the channel LP. Considering he's played DS1 multiple times by now, he's likely done a magic build here too.
[0:19:16] <+Lordgale119> TWO
[0:19:17] <jackelzxaa> oh yeah go human
[0:19:21] <%Xaeveax> Don't give up, skeleton!
[0:19:21] <jackelzxaa> npc invader on the way to nito
[0:19:22] <%aram909> @jackelzxaa easily worst boss of all the souls games and in the like top 50 worst bosses of all time
[0:19:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Lordgale119
[0:19:34] <%MajorCrasher> the first dlc boss is easy tho. the rest of them are the hard ones
[0:19:37] <%Pillagius> why is this so funny?
[0:19:44] <+Shishi1205> Do you know which magic is busted? Connjurations in DS3 convergence
[0:19:45] <Treasure_Vault> @Prevot The first boss is a gatekeeper, and Reggie doesn't use gates
[0:19:46] <jackelzxaa> homing crystal soul security plan.
[0:19:53] <urkleturtle> gets hit, still kills the dude during it

[0:21:24] <ThatChainmecha> we have skeletons but no skelelbs? wtf fromsoft?
[0:21:31] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So a really silly thing you can do is swap in this ring and the Symbol of Avarice the moment you kill a boss, and it gives you substantially more souls for the boss kill.
[0:21:31] <+Shishi1205> shield of want Sadge
[0:21:34] <AbnormalVoid> can it be combined?
[0:21:43] <+FirebirdXR> sivsarcast, you better put the Skeleton Warriors intro when doing the compilation....
[0:21:44] <deeriojim> @Arqartur0 sounds like bloodborne, right now its bone zone

[0:21:56] <%Lion_kun> DLC will humble Reggie
[0:21:57] <wholesomepimp> hey at @WoolieVersus I hope it isnt too much of a spoiler but i made it to the ''idiot doom spiral'' guy in disco elysium, and I need to know. Is it actually Plague?
[0:21:58] <turdsman> hey buddy
[0:22:01] <AbnormalVoid> wait, yeah, it can, I'm thinking of the item discovery one
[0:22:02] <jackelzxaa> does the dlc bosses have decent magic resistence?
[0:22:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> Doing the John Lennon goofy walk through the zone
[0:22:03] <lord_of_the_dragons> 420 PogChamp
[0:22:06] <klooswep> But what if we were EVEN MORE overpowered tho?
[0:22:10] <+swesterly> Hmmmmm serpent is an imperfect dragon and symbol of the undead you say?🤔
[0:22:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's great LUL

[0:22:39] <HotSauceFiend> Gods still take fall damage
[0:22:39] <%Javaa01> I mean, it's no Bloodborne cum dungeon, but it's a step towards it
[0:22:39] <+Bitscreed> "Overconfidence is a slow and insidious..." etc etc
[0:22:41] <JdotSweapA> maybe if you actually jump reggie?
[0:22:41] <ArvidOnFire> I forget, are divine weapons beneficial in TotG, or just in Catacombs?
[0:22:42] <%Pillagius> at least Gravity can stop Reggie still
[0:22:43] <Johannen> Does Cast Light illuminate further?
[0:22:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Your flashlight needs new batteries I think
[0:22:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> There's no magic to protect you from yourself
[0:22:45] <ThatChainmecha> oh no
[0:22:47] <%Tearonex> Gravity > Any souls build LUL

[0:32:18] <%holydeviant1> @holydeviant1 Yeah  that one!
[0:32:20] <%Pillagius> This is so ridiculous. Skeleton going like "I'm big and SCARY!" and Reggie just comes up to him and breaks his shin bone...
[0:32:20] <Jaxnos> the only weakness the spell has is geometry, honestly

[0:32:59] <Jaxnos> @Jaxnos yeah that's what i mean ty

[0:33:32] <+HumanDoctor> the best weapon for pvp is your skill

[0:34:07] <ArvidOnFire> And on your left you can see CHAOS
[0:34:08] <seydaq> its an effigy of you
[0:34:08] <Jaxnos> best weapon for pvp is having no dignity and scumming it super hard
[0:34:11] <Rawbone_saw> chaos and lighting will get you best returns for pure damage in pvp
[0:34:22] <benupde287> It’s an effigy OF you
[0:34:24] <%cubbywolf> what a noob he died first
[0:34:30] <deeriojim> real effing Nito
[0:34:31] <%tigerfang86> tryna steal some god power to kill some gods
[0:34:37] <ArvidOnFire> Art competition shield?
[0:34:42] <dundore77> yeah i never understood the first of the dead thing. did people not die before neto?
[0:34:43] <BurdRightsActivist> WH OMEGALUL
[0:34:45] <%holydeviant1> Everyone trying to steal Nito's power
[0:34:45] <+Shishi1205> I used the gods to destroy the gtods
[0:34:45] <Hozak> If Nito was first of the dead where did he get all the skeletons from?
[0:34:55] <+ArtemisCroc> @dundore77 yes actually
[0:34:56] <deeriojim> I thought the blood shield was the competition winner?
[0:34:56] <+Zidart> @Zidart I see
[0:34:56] <klooswep> Nito getting 100th place in Dark Souls Battle Royale
[0:34:59] <rasamune> @Hozak was just about to ask that myself lmao
[0:35:01] <seydaq> do you turn into your effigy?
[0:35:07] <%Juriasu> @Hozak evo18MindBlown
[0:35:07] <%holydeviant1> @Hozak First among the dead, as in, the greatest
[0:35:09] <velgaduere> @dundore77 a lot of people also didn't exist
[0:35:14] <andre11dr> Chaos is probably the best weapon buff ,it does crazy damage, but you gotta farm humanity
[0:35:28] <Reveresao> BLIND
[0:35:28] <%Pillagius> Amusing thing I find about Nito is basically he basically first idiot who found a way to die and that is his super power...
[0:35:29] <ArvidOnFire> @dundore77 Without disparity, nothing lived or died, so I imagine Nito was literally the first being who died
[0:35:40] <brunoberserk> lot of skeletons , PAIGE LOVES IT
[0:35:44] <seydaq> do you dance like this? forever bitterBop
[0:35:47] <Hozak> @Hozak That's just what he wants you to think!
[0:35:59] <agustorm123> Ohh we back

[0:36:34] <%cubbywolf> ledge
[0:36:35] <JdotSweapA> LOOKS KINDA ASHY OUT THERE
[0:36:35] <LunarRemix> Ash Lake
[0:36:38] <%Pillagius> @Hozak I mean, before the age of fire - there was no life or death and Nito is first dead guy. He probably first one to die to gravity
[0:36:57] <%tigerfang86> this tomb is DEEP
[0:36:57] <%Xaeveax> Smells like hydra flesh
[0:37:00] <seydaq> very low but still not the bottom
[0:37:01] <%tigerfang86> DEEP AS HELL
[0:37:07] <Riyokuno> ass lake
[0:37:10] <time_axis> just a hint to show players that zone exists
[0:37:10] <ThatChainmecha> stop deboning this place
[0:37:10] <+TopTieramisu> the world's connectivity is so great in this game
[0:37:11] <Hozak> Reggie is now one of the Big Hole Boys
[0:37:13] <brunoberserk> leeeeeeeeeeeeeeroy
[0:37:13] <jackelzxaa> ash lake goes on so far it goes to bloodborne
[0:37:24] <andre11dr> I think when they say "The First of the Dead" they might mean the leader of death people, not actually the first guy to die
[0:37:25] <JdotSweapA> it SHOULDNT cuz we arent nearly that far down but its cool that they wanted to portray that we're this far down
[0:37:26] <AbnormalVoid> dang, probably not human for Leeroy, huh?

[0:47:39] <Riyokuno> the fan made shield
[0:47:41] <+TopTieramisu> he has no need for wimpy shields
[0:47:45] <%SaintBeau> passive regen
[0:47:50] <LunarRemix> @ThePich It's sort of implied he doesn't the player to get Nito's occult powers

[0:48:01] <agustorm123> Very slowly tho
[0:48:05] <AnonymousNate_> @jackelzxaa He definitely made a good build. A lot of people decide not to use magic at all and high level sorceries turn the game on easy mode basically
[0:48:07] <+king_of_mystery2> Telle him about the grant wrath of god woolie
[0:48:11] <Treasure_Vault> I love Reggarth's smile

[0:48:36] <%tigerfang86> reggarth just vibing
[0:48:37] <Jaxnos> now back to baby bones
[0:48:37] <jackelzxaa> magic is much more balanced in ds2 despite you having more spells to play with including some cool anime shit
[0:48:39] <%A_German_spy> LUL
[0:48:44] <Johannen> Net benefit of 1 humanity
[0:48:46] <jackelzxaa> kill sans' little brothers
[0:48:54] <agustorm123> Socky socky?
[0:48:57] <%Prevot> making AI is hard
[0:49:01] <+Shishi1205> costs 200 durability tho
[0:49:02] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Leeroy Jenkins he is not
[0:49:03] <jackelzxaa> velstadt he isn't
[0:49:03] <ds3namecaldara> And this is why ds2 Maldrin exists
[0:49:11] <AbnormalVoid> ARROWED
[0:49:11] <%RemedyofRevenge> Reggarth aint about that FAITH + 1
[0:49:16] <jackelzxaa> velstadt might be one of the coolest boys
[0:49:17] <andre11dr> @jackelzxaa To bad they nerfed it overtime
[0:49:19] <AnonymousNate_> DS2 magic is more balanced aside from Climax and Resonant Soul... Those are some of the most busted spells in the series
[0:49:31] <%Pillagius> So we're not exactly close to the end, but what's the plan for next one, Woolie, Reggie?
[0:49:37] <tomo_vendor> @AnonymousNate_ and soul geyser, that thing could oneshot literally every boss before being nerfed LUL
[0:49:44] <jackelzxaa> @andre11dr thats what i mean, they brought the power down
[0:49:45] <%holydeviant1> Might as well just tell him
[0:49:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> First Woolie does a faith build, then he plays Crusader in DNF duel...Woolie is healing
[0:49:54] <agustorm123> 1 bone per frame
[0:49:57] <jackelzxaa> magic is really good as an accompanyment to a str build
[0:49:57] <seydaq> why is a holy warrior invading humans in the catacombs tho?
[0:50:00] <jackelzxaa> int + str in ds2 is real valid
[0:50:01] <%atlasdotwav> Too skrong
[0:50:16] <%SaintBeau> @seydaq he worships nito, and doesn't want you to kill him
[0:50:19] <andre11dr> I respect the idea of Climax....but that spell was a mistake

[1:03:14] <%ThePich> you sure you dn't want to kindle
[1:03:15] <Johannen> Did Reggie just abandoned sorcery on the basis of the message?
[1:03:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah,he's missing a REAL good secret
[1:03:23] <%hiswill98> Has he reached N yet?
[1:03:25] <Milfhunterextraodinaire> Nito's daycare is locked behind the golden fog gate.

[1:03:41] <dude_bruhh> @WoolieVersus there is a second bonfire which you may or may not give him a tip about
[1:03:45] <%ThePich> @Johannen reggie is easily influenced
[1:03:46] <andre11dr> Reggie ain't using that R2 that much huh? He seems to think that 4 uses will break his weapon
[1:03:48] <Arqartur0> LeReggie Jenkins
[1:04:00] <JdotSweapA> nothing really amazing left pre leroy
[1:04:13] <~WoolieVersus> @dude_bruhh literally doing that

[1:04:17] <JdotSweapA> oh wait....did reggie find the tomb?
[1:04:18] <Johannen> @JdotSweapA apart from the bonfire
[1:04:24] <%atlasdotwav> Hey, did he get to the um Archer....with the uh....yknow
[1:04:29] <+Breaknoon> DaS is like 3D Castlevania if it weren't garbage
[1:04:32] <seydaq> just a lil warm goodnes
[1:04:38] <Arqartur0> so, in essence, Dark Souls is cleaning up the messes of the former Ages of the World?
[1:04:38] <BurdRightsActivist> @WoolieVersus literally?
[1:04:44] <tolloponik> ah yeah Bone Zone
[1:04:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> Isn't that like the highest damage flurry attack in the game?
[1:04:47] <AbnormalVoid> isn't it a illusory wall?
[1:04:47] <JdotSweapA> @Johannen he missed it? oof
[1:04:48] <andre11dr> @breaknoon Nah ,that's Bloodborne
[1:04:50] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Might wanna consider ring of sacrifice to keep those 110k souls
[1:04:54] <ArvidOnFire> Those things have poise like nothing else
[1:04:55] <%MrATheGreat> @WoolieVersus btw you guys forgot to check the paladin armor if you wanted to check it.
[1:04:56] <agustorm123> Real Giant bones are so interesting
[1:04:57] <+Shishi1205> guys woolie is gonna make Reggie explore 100% of the game one way or another
[1:04:59] <+oz_suka> why is Reggie refussing to kindle?
[1:05:00] <+Breaknoon> @andre11dr You right
[1:05:13] <+lag2993> kinda dark souls is more about old stubborn people refusing to change and instead enslaving humanity so that things remain the same
[1:05:22] <rasamune> I assume he's just not thinking about it
[1:05:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @lag2993 So like real life?
[1:05:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> I just noticed the bonfires and messages have a very similar hue/light, neat
[1:05:34] <+Shishi1205> grab em and bone out
[1:05:38] <foghornleghorn55> best looking set imo
[1:05:40] <Darren716> Yupp

[1:07:26] <%MrATheGreat> Reggie getting BRAVE
[1:07:37] <%RemedyofRevenge> Damn, Leeroy rerolled a horde character after dying in raid

[1:11:37] <dontleavemealone4toolong> too weak
[1:11:38] <deeriojim> this is a no-fap run yea
[1:11:42] <+Sir_Louis> I find your lack of faith disturbing
[1:11:46] <brunoberserk> NEEDS MORE JESUS
[1:11:48] <deeriojim> even though NNN is over
[1:11:49] <%MrATheGreat> Reggie doesn't believe enough
[1:12:00] <andre11dr> Jesus didn't like you enough
[1:12:04] <agustorm123> Bone zone
[1:12:10] <SunsetJack> It helps.
[1:12:10] <+Dakuu75> Woolie, you might as well ask him "You wanna see something cool?" lol
[1:12:13] <%MrATheGreat> yeah clear it all out
[1:12:20] <KeiganOfAstora> What spot?
[1:12:28] <%atlasdotwav> I like a weapon with a dude name
[1:12:32] <seydaq> definitely dont need it, just completionist
[1:12:33] <legacy0117> Oh right faith determines resistance to dark damage doesn’t it?
[1:12:34] <+superkeaton> Man, I was replaying last night and absentmindedly told Patches I was a cleric. Feels bad man.
[1:12:48] <KeiganOfAstora> @superkeaton And then he's never a merchant?
[1:12:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:51] <%livlinn> speeeen
[1:12:57] <+superkeaton> yep, insta hostile
[1:12:59] <LunarRemix> They're still very very real
[1:13:00] <KeiganOfAstora> ew
[1:13:02] <%BisoromiBear> chased
[1:13:05] <%MrATheGreat> yeah this place is great but damn is it easy to miss things
[1:13:09] <AbnormalVoid> chomp chomp chomp
[1:13:09] <+patel347> did he get silver covetus?
[1:13:14] <+oz_suka> dog bone
[1:13:14] <deeriojim> yes
[1:13:16] <%Rafoki> feral bone will get you
[1:13:16] <%Pillagius> seriously, after Reggie died to Pinwheel - these skeletons got a lot more courageous
[1:13:18] <JorgenTheElf> Hey, I know this game
[1:13:18] <dude_bruhh> dark souls: shadows bite twice
[1:13:21] <Johannen> Reggie abandoen magic and it bit him in the ass
[1:13:22] <seydaq> @superkeaton bitterEnd
[1:13:30] <%SaintBeau> does reggie know about the second bonfire
[1:13:39] <$JobbedBone> I hate these guys
[1:13:43] <trench2nowhere> kindle
[1:13:45] <sirrice77> @SaintBeau the what now?
[1:13:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @SaintBeau that's what woolie is nudging him to
[1:13:50] <tolloponik> I wonder if these bone dogs have the same animation skeleton as the werewolf enemies in BloodBorne
[1:13:52] <LunarRemix> These are probably the worst regular enemies on the game
[1:14:15] <deeriojim> the heaviest hitting perhaås
[1:14:21] <hannahilation> as an anime only watcher it's good to see reggie rocking the mlgs
[1:14:37] <SunsetJack> Finally
[1:14:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Its the upcoming room with a normal skeleton and dog
[1:14:56] <%MrATheGreat> Maybe Reg should throw a few prism stone around just to know what paths he's been down
[1:15:02] <%SaintBeau> there it was LUL
[1:15:05] <legacy0117> Good luck trying to beat this boss, everything Nito does inflicts dark damage.
[1:15:13] <BurdRightsActivist> THERE IT WAS DUDE
[1:15:17] <%Pillagius> funny enough - Reggie could've noticed his destination several times now
[1:15:38] <%SaintBeau> PogChamp
[1:15:40] <%MrATheGreat> Bonfire 2
[1:15:42] <SunsetJack> Yay, bonfire.
[1:15:42] <%Xaeveax> Praise be
[1:15:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep
[1:15:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he did it!
[1:15:44] <velgaduere> andyPog
[1:15:49] <agustorm123> Bonfire 2 nice
[1:15:54] <kaptain_marty> wait what??
[1:15:55] <BurdRightsActivist> B-B-Bonfire
[1:15:57] <%SaintBeau> praise the sun \[T]/
[1:16:05] <%SaintBeau> might wanna kindle lol
[1:16:06] <oak120> This bonfire run is super safe too
[1:16:07] <%MrATheGreat> It's like 20 feet from the last one but every inch is worth it
[1:16:14] <foghornleghorn55> i never saw this and i beat the game like 4 times
[1:16:15] <deeriojim> less big dog skeletons to pass thru too
[1:16:16] <%Pillagius> You know what's the difference between that bonfire and the others? It's Bonefire
[1:16:17] <Aixenn> i find it so funny when people discover that bonfire
[1:16:33] <%SaintBeau> still doesn't kindle LUL
[1:16:35] <agustorm123> Is worth it
[1:16:37] <+Shishi1205> thats what I was thinking kindling the old one is not worth
[1:16:38] <SunsetJack> He better kindle...
[1:16:39] <%Prevot> LUL
[1:16:45] <glass_marcus> you can miss AREAS
[1:16:49] <deeriojim> I just kindle both, humanity isnt that rare by the point I do this part, usually
[1:16:51] <+Shishi1205> true
[1:16:57] <+Shishi1205> at least 2 areas are missable
[1:16:58] <%MrATheGreat> I beat this game two times before I discovered the Darkroot Garden Bonfire
[1:17:05] <%Lion_kun> DS2 is full of hidden ones
[1:17:05] <thep3asantking> Bonertown, Lordran
[1:17:26] <ds3namecaldara> LUL
[1:17:29] <+eanscrale> A lot of people assume the sen's fortress "try jumping" bonfire is just a troll as well
[1:17:33] <tachi_gigas> how did the last two Nito attempts go?
[1:17:34] <@Solidus_113> I had to leave to pick up a PS5, so first 2 attempts no bets sorry
[1:17:40] <+eanscrale> when you really should try jumping
[1:17:40] <%atlasdotwav> The forest, sens, gwyndolin....this, like a ton are missable
[1:17:44] <%SaintBeau> @tachi_gigas about what you'd expect
[1:17:46] <andre11dr> Chat, you just gotta believe
[1:17:48] <%Xaeveax> @Lion_kun That one at the castle (outside) is so hard to find if you don't know.
[1:17:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Solidus_113 yo nice
[1:17:58] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 this is his second attempt but it works too
[1:18:01] <%MrATheGreat> The sen's fortress bonfire is the worst imo. You miss that and every boss run's a nightmare
[1:18:05] <Darren716> Has he totally lost the 100k?
[1:18:07] <agustorm123> Hope he doesn’t do a O&S
[1:18:07] <%Ensign_Epic> @Solidus_113 gratz on the PS5
[1:18:12] <AnonymousNate_> Sen's Fortress bonfire can be seen pretty clearly if you just pan the camera a bit though
[1:18:12] <+Shishi1205> @Darren716 he cashed out
[1:18:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Darren716 he spent em
[1:18:15] <%Deasmeister> @deeriojim they spent the 20 humanity on chaos servant so it is a bit more limited
[1:18:19] <Darren716> Ah good shit
[1:18:24] <Darren716> all on int?
[1:18:30] <+Shishi1205> 42 ye
[1:18:30] <%MrATheGreat> THATS A REAL THREAT to some builds at least

[1:30:22] <AnonymousNate_> Speedruns use a moveswap glitch to do rapier running attack with greatswords and great clubs LUL
[1:30:23] <%MrATheGreat> That's fair LUL
[1:30:23] <+parazoa42> There's a whole item crafting system.
[1:30:23] <@Solidus_113> red hot shot for revive
[1:30:25] <DextralMalin> I have doubts of pyro, but prove me wrong
[1:30:26] <+Bitscreed> You have to do the twirly stick motion to mix the ingredients for them
[1:30:32] <OldManDeckardCain> Woolie "I'm so good at Bayo I don't even remember it had items to help you" Madden Kappa
[1:30:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @AnonymousNate_ DS2 had NPC invaders in the dlc who'd use the white ring to disguise as phantoms, and some who'd use the funny "VERY GOOD" carvings after killing you
[1:30:34] <klooswep> There are items, but there's also another strategy called "Not being a bicth"
[1:30:36] <@Menitta> OOOOOH no items in DMC past 4.
[1:30:37] <agustorm123> hope he remembers who is the boss
[1:30:38] <+rumblarrock> Artisan lolipops

[1:31:14] <@Menitta> Because I beat DMC5 like 6 times this year and the only item in 5 is the gorb
[1:31:15] <%holydeviant1> you have to hit the boss
[1:31:18] <Raldavar> every time you summon in Elden Rings they force a cutscene where you do the Walk of Shame in Game of Thrones
[1:31:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> "shown him" LUL
[1:31:25] <+ArtemisCroc> reggie why

[1:31:31] <%SaintBeau> DS2 takes fucking forever
[1:31:31] <velgaduere> good thing he's not playing a different game then huh
[1:31:37] <yukichocomilk> ds3 is fast
[1:31:38] <Equirah> in the future you can wiggle and dodge
[1:31:39] <%holydeviant1> you have to hit. the boss.
[1:31:40] <%Xaeveax> In Bloodborne it's kill or die
[1:31:41] <agustorm123> Sip and die
[1:31:42] <AnonymousNate_> @BurdRightsActivist Yeah I remember the one in the Snow DLC. Follows you for a while and then surprise backstabs you, scared me so much
[1:31:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> jeez
[1:31:45] <%MrATheGreat> hey sip or die now
[1:31:45] <+Dakuu75> Idk why the "take a sip" always sounds so agressive
[1:31:45] <oak120> @legacy0117 His problem is not damage output.
[1:31:48] <%aram909> REGGIE ATTACK THE BOSS JEEZ
[1:31:50] <klooswep> In DS2 when you take 3 hours per sip it's hard to estus tank
[1:31:51] <Karhax> always aggroing the big lads

[1:32:14] <agustorm123> Remember who is the boss Reggie
[1:32:17] <%Prevot> has reggie even swung at the boss once
[1:32:22] <%ThePich> this is not MGS£ you can't kill him with old age reggie
[1:32:23] <LunarRemix> You *could* take a divine weapon just to kill the skeletons so they not revive
[1:32:24] <+ArtemisCroc> I don't know what reggie is actually trying to do here
[1:32:25] <yukichocomilk> nah if he just runs around i'm sure the boss will die
[1:32:27] <+Shishi1205> hit nito
[1:32:29] <charrchord> he did burn him a bit once
[1:32:29] <Hozak> Reggie is running around waiting for an opportunity that may never come
[1:32:29] <andre11dr> Maybe the  Chaos fireball would be more useful here instead
[1:32:30] <misterbarkley> swing first!
[1:32:31] <sozemd> He avoided using any attacks

[1:34:36] <lord_of_the_dragons> dlc time

[1:34:43] <+swesterly> Believers RISE
[1:34:44] <klooswep> who knew?
[1:34:45] <sothatsprettybrutal> "try fire" he was working on this whole time
[1:34:46] <%BignanasTheGawd> Just lost my 401k
[1:34:47] <%Deasmeister> it also kept the ads down
[1:34:47] <Supabait> firestorm is rng that second to last cast got a ton of hits and melted him
[1:34:50] <ALvl78Zapdos> DLC TIME BABY
[1:34:51] <%Lion_kun> FUCK WHOEVER WROTE THAT MESSAGE
[1:34:53] <legacy0117> Yooooo he did it. ^^
[1:34:59] <%tigerfang86> that message was GOATED
[1:35:00] <AbnormalVoid> brute smarts
[1:35:01] <%Ensign_Epic> BACK TO THE PAST
[1:35:02] <lord_of_the_dragons> KILL IT WITH FIRE always works
[1:35:03] <charrchord> all of nitos attack kill the ads
[1:35:04] <andre11dr> You made the first of the dead more dead.....i guess
[1:35:04] <%Lion_kun> I lost 75k because of it
[1:35:05] <%MrATheGreat> Skele-friendly fire is onm
[1:35:05] <seydaq> who knew aoe beats crowd mobs
[1:35:08] <+OneTrueAsshat> let him know he could have used a divine weapons to perma kill skellies
[1:35:08] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @lion_kun nito is weak to fire
[1:35:09] <Qsmash_> divine weapons also make sure the skeletons stay down
[1:35:10] <+ArtemisCroc> woolie is just mad that reggie's strat worked lol
[1:35:17] <Johannen> DLC time?
[1:35:17] <Dopamien> lmao
[1:35:18] <nxflre> @Lion_kun BUT HEE USED PYRO. He rarely does so its great
[1:35:18] <%atlasdotwav> Gwyn time
[1:35:19] <%holydeviant1> Thanks for the points~
[1:35:21] <Dopamien> get shot
[1:35:23] <%Prevot> you can also just not aggro most of the skeletons
[1:35:25] <%guiltyboya> Bone-fire?
[1:35:26] <happy_void> I think firetempest was his best play in that moment
[1:35:29] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus Also, if you stay at the area you drop into the boss arena at and dont stray from it, several large skeletons do not aggro to you
[1:35:29] <%jamsbybetty> Fire worked baybee. Kept the skeletons down after Nito flattened them
[1:35:29] <+JFKRobot> @WoolieVersus can you tell him about the divine weapons vs. skeletons?
[1:35:30] <Johannen> CRYSTAL SPEAR
[1:35:35] <Grim1952> New londo left or did he already do it?
[1:35:36] <+DeaconBluesClues> I think its cool his strat worked although I sure as fuck wouldn't do that lmao
[1:35:38] <urkleturtle> if you just stay at the entrance only nito and like 2 skellies get aggro'd and you don't even have to bother with the rest lol
[1:35:39] <+Shishi1205> @JFKRobot he knows
[1:35:39] <dundore77> @JFKRobot he already knew that
[1:35:40] <%holydeviant1> This felt like DIO getting hit with hamon in part 3
[1:35:41] <%patriotrenegade> sloppy
[1:35:41] <klooswep> Sometimes ya gotta romance some pies to kill a skeleton army
[1:35:42] <sothatsprettybrutal> gotta pump intelligence to then just use pyro
[1:35:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> reggie vs dlc
[1:35:43] <velgaduere> 6k till next andyPog
[1:35:43] <+TheLakinessMonster> pyro is great in ds1 because you can always have it in your back pocket
[1:35:45] <andre11dr> That means that it's DLC time KomodoHype
[1:35:46] <TheBlackestBaron> dlc time

[1:35:52] <Equirah> @nxflre so you just joined the playthrough huh? LUL
[1:35:53] <%aram909> all thats left now is the DLC
[1:35:54] <+DeaconBluesClues> was that the last lord soul
[1:35:55] <+Baldzinga> DLC time boys
[1:35:55] <%aram909> then the endgame
[1:35:56] <%Lion_kun> Pop a soul to get another level
[1:35:57] <%MrATheGreat> Are we IN now?
[1:35:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You did well. I'm genuinely impressed.
[1:35:59] <BlueEagle2395> the huge AOE really helped
[1:36:05] <Darren716> Next stop White Breath
[1:36:08] <Supabait> up in there 😳
[1:36:14] <cs0402196> lost money to rng aoe
[1:36:14] <%SaintBeau> DLC time PogChamp
[1:36:15] <nxflre> @Equirah nah been watching from beginning
[1:36:19] <Johannen> @Darren716 First one more slot
[1:36:19] <Grim1952> @Grim1952 Thanks, nest part of the game left then
[1:36:22] <+Bitscreed> Reggarth diving under Nito's skirt and letting off fireworks.
[1:36:26] <%guiltyboya> Time for *spoiler town*
[1:36:28] <%holydeviant1> @A_German_spy The best pyromancy in the game didn't hurt
[1:36:28] <agustorm123> DLC LETS GO
[1:36:29] <%MrATheGreat> Just gotta ignore your fear and go in
[1:36:30] <seydaq> reggie got the galactica vangard on nito enbSun
[1:36:33] <andre11dr> DLC got some godlike magic too
[1:36:35] <legacy0117> Lol. Nice.
[1:36:35] <%FallenAngelZelos> Woolie saying "why not do this?" when he's the king of doing suboptimal things for the sake of looking cool.
[1:36:36] <+JFKRobot> @nxflre @dundore77 @Shishi1205 ty
[1:36:44] <Artiamus> So I missed the last session, what does he have left to do?
[1:36:48] <%SaintBeau> every boss in the DLC is extremely resistant to magic LUL
[1:36:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> nito is a point character, he needs assists to do work
[1:36:50] <%holydeviant1> CRYSTAL SOUL SPEAAAAR
[1:36:53] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> can we start betting for sanctuary guardian, I need to get my points back
[1:37:04] <+swesterly> Started the stream sub 30k and am now sitting at a cool 75k love predictions lmaoooooo
[1:37:10] <+GilroyGoldBlood> oh god I forgot about Sanctuary Guardian
[1:37:11] <andre11dr> @artiamus Just the DLC and Gwyn
[1:37:11] <Johannen> @ncr7wms3r22b7n3 That's be a reality check for Reggie)
[1:37:16] <%patriotrenegade> I hate Sanctuary Guardian so much
[1:37:25] <%SaintBeau> Sanctuary Guardian is a glass cannon
[1:37:30] <%MrATheGreat> Test that magic
[1:37:30] <Artiamus> Nice. Any idea where he's going next?
[1:37:37] <%SaintBeau> but with the MLGS it's gonna be a nightmare
[1:37:42] <%holydeviant1> @Artiamus Only DLC or Kiln left
[1:37:50] <Johannen> @SaintBeau He might just shoot him to death
[1:37:54] <foghornleghorn55> DLC time
[1:37:57] <LunarRemix> And if you bring Divine weapons the skeletons don't come back at all
[1:38:00] <+ArtemisCroc> sanctuary guardian is easy once you know how is patterns work, but that's almost every boss in this game
[1:38:14] <Karhax> Crystal soul spear might crush sanctuary guardian
[1:38:25] <oak120> no
[1:38:26] <depressioncherrie> Doesn't Sanctuary Guardian also have fairly high Magic Resistance?
[1:38:33] <andre11dr> Ohhhh yeah, i forgot Sanctuary Guardian realists magic, this could be rough
[1:38:34] <%SaintBeau> @depressioncherrie every DLC boss does
[1:38:35] <+Dakuu75> Woolie sounds like he's trying so-SO hard to not piss reggie off
[1:38:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NICE
[1:38:38] <seydaq> if the spear hits sg hops around
[1:38:43] <%Prevot> STRONK
[1:38:47] <%MrATheGreat> oh and remember you got that real Nito lord soul to check
[1:38:48] <%SaintBeau> literally every DLC boss has crazy high magic resistance
[1:38:49] <%tigerfang86> Reggie is massive, it's not like sanctuary guard is that hard
[1:38:52] <ArvidOnFire> Sanctuary Guardian time, AKA drastic jump in boss fight polish lmao
[1:38:53] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah the DLC bosses laugh at elemental damage
[1:38:57] <+DeaconBluesClues> I literally just did R2 to him with zweihander on 1st playthrough over and over and and got him in one try (which tbh described nearly every fight after iron golum in a zwei str build outside of artorias)
[1:38:58] <Dopamien> its a shame all big magic you work up to ends up just going 'pew' FeelsBadMan
[1:39:07] <Artiamus> He save Solaire?
[1:39:07] <%Prevot> sword boy isn't too magic resistant
[1:39:08] <+oz_suka> ok Scarface
[1:39:12] <%tigerfang86> POCKETSSSSSS
[1:39:12] <%MooseIsGoose> dlc
[1:39:13] <velgaduere> literally only two places left to go now
[1:39:15] <nxflre> @Artiamus he is saved!
[1:39:20] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Get someone who smiles at you like Reggie smiles at crystal soul spear
[1:39:21] <%SaintBeau> the world is yours, Scarface
[1:39:23] <%Prevot> I killed him with soul spear only last time I played
[1:39:25] <seydaq> solaire saved spyPraise
[1:39:32] <Artiamus> @Artiamus \|T|/
[1:39:32] <Darren716> Pump to 50 for max damage and White Breath
[1:39:34] <andre11dr> I do remember that Manus doesn't give a fuck about magic, it tickles him
[1:39:41] <+Shishi1205> why just farm for a level
[1:39:49] <nxflre> @andre11dr eeverything tickles for him
[1:39:50] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @andre11dr oh that's gonna be a fun one lol
[1:39:53] <BlueEagle2395> he can't upgrade any of his armor right?
[1:39:54] <%Rafoki> he could lvl for more spell slots?
[1:40:03] <BurdRightsActivist> use the paladin set or forever be a coward.
[1:40:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah getting more spell slots would be a good call
[1:40:26] <+king_of_mystery2> I think the only thing that upgrades that he has on is the helm which is already upgraded
[1:40:26] <derap41> And you thought his build was unviable Woolie
[1:40:57] <Darren716> Let him get to 50 int
[1:40:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:41:04] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Cant upgrade armor cause its a unique anyway
[1:41:09] <velgaduere> just two points of attunement'll do it
[1:41:11] <Jaxnos> the holiest of trousers
[1:41:12] <Aixenn> get that 50 INT :)
[1:41:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> guys relax no matter what he does he's solid
[1:41:23] <BigYanno> have we done the dlc yet?
[1:41:28] <%MrATheGreat> Dommel will now allow you to wear skeltons Kappa
[1:41:30] <ArvidOnFire> Which was the style at the time
[1:41:31] <+pectusumbra> If he's willing to go lighter on armor, could take off havels for an attunement ring along with bellowing dragon
[1:41:31] <pi_in_the_sci> Did you go back to pyromancy girl after BoC
[1:41:31] <velgaduere> 16 yes
[1:41:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @BigYanno about to
[1:41:47] <+Shishi1205> isnt crystal 46 int?
[1:41:57] <emptyantics> Which boss is he missing?
[1:42:09] <%Prevot> the last one
[1:42:11] <%jamsbybetty> oooh I hear that microwave going off snacktime

[1:43:03] <+Shishi1205> @derap41 this was not the build Woolie advised against
[1:43:19] <+pectusumbra> fire tempest should be good enough
[1:43:19] <gespenstkick> Chaor storm
[1:43:20] <BurdRightsActivist> firestorm
[1:43:20] <%Grimlockfly> farming attunement
[1:43:21] <Sapphire_Breeze> heaven's arena HxH training arc continues
[1:43:27] <+Shishi1205> good
[1:43:28] <Raldavar> keep bellowing ring for the overkill so phalanx drop more souls
[1:43:29] <andre11dr> People can literally literally beat this game without attacking
[1:43:31] <velgaduere> storm and tempest are both good
[1:43:31] <gespenstkick> yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:43:41] <Afrosamasenpai> big fire go brr
[1:43:48] <%holydeviant1> @derap41 It's more the "Mike Tyson pulls out a taser" argument, but then Tyson upgraded to a bazooka

[1:46:53] <derap41> Woolie stealing chats credit
[1:46:53] <Dopamien> stupid? 😡 they worked hard for those
[1:46:54] <+Shishi1205> @Juriasu no frampt
[1:46:54] <Johannen> @Juriasu Its junk
[1:47:01] <%Deasmeister> @athuramn her at Woolievs we do our grinding on stream
[1:47:02] <+GilroyGoldBlood> getting flashbacks to Old Monk invaders using this shit to one shot players when they enter the arena
[1:47:02] <Hozak> It's good but its no changing the enemies to all be Seath and then wracking up souls.
[1:47:04] <%mundanelotus> Why are they back here???
[1:47:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus if you still had Frampt selling the leather shields and Spears also makes you some moolah
[1:47:09] <velgaduere> idk why he runs all the way around them

[1:47:23] <%jamsbybetty> baby skeletons is a better spot imo but way more annoying to get to
[1:47:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> @GilroyGoldBlood good old times of casting while moving
[1:47:30] <%BignanasTheGawd> I hope in Elden ring they let us refight bosses

[1:50:38] <legacy0117> Each element type is made of either Intelligence, Faith, or a combination of the two. As long as you know which those you figure out the weaknesses of the bosses. ^^

[1:50:43] <tachi_gigas> LUL LUL
[1:50:45] <+FirebirdXR> I do wonder if it's beneficial to tell them of the soul duplication glitch if they were playing on PC. Just to save on the overall farming. I'd feel it might make things less accomplished...
[1:50:48] <Deko_> i forgor
[1:50:48] <Blank9> reggie prepped to be the magician

[1:51:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Boar mage!
[1:51:14] <Darren716> I don't think you can't warp
[1:51:15] <+Shishi1205> Reggie 8 spears are better than 4 chaos fireballs. But if you like the balls then its up to you

[1:52:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> well, wyvern
[1:52:07] <DSD24> Priscilla was here
[1:52:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> wyvern
[1:52:12] <agustorm123> Dragons are rare
[1:52:12] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah! Did reggie ever do valley of the drakes?
[1:52:12] <%atlasdotwav> That's a fun fight
[1:52:14] <yukichocomilk> same shit
[1:52:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you've met....2 I think??
[1:52:15] <Grim1952> The drake heals with low hp, not worth it
[1:52:15] <legacy0117> Fluffy tail ahead.
[1:52:17] <%Prevot> yeah, dragon's don't prey on young women, only drakes
[1:52:19] <nxflre> whats the difference again?
[1:52:19] <@Menitta> i want a josh
[1:52:19] <Johannen> Patches HYPE
[1:52:22] <%aram909> did reggie fight priscilla?
[1:52:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @pectusumbra like 2 sessions ago
[1:52:29] <+Shishi1205> 4 legs 2 wings
[1:52:33] <DSD24> Wyverns are lamer then Dragons
[1:52:36] <Dabrikishaw> Reggared versus Hellkite Drake!
[1:52:40] <Hozak> Most of our definitions come from Heraldry
[1:52:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @aram909 did you see her?
[1:52:41] <+pectusumbra> @Reverend_Roscoe got ya, I probably missed it while working
[1:52:42] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah Patches is at Firelink now
[1:52:42] <velgaduere> you don't even dream of fucking with wyrms
[1:52:47] <Treasure_Vault> Just bone to a bonefire, right?
[1:52:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> Who knew there was an entire science to dragon anatomy?
[1:52:55] <sothatsprettybrutal> @aram909 he did
[1:52:56] <%holydeviant1> Wyrms are no-wings and are just HUGE HONKIN' LIZZARDS
[1:52:56] <Darren716> I mean when you get down to it they're all fake so you can call them whatever you want
[1:52:58] <%DreamCancel01> can't wyrms talk?
[1:52:58] <%aram909> @Reverend_Roscoe i thought she disappeared after a while, no?
[1:53:00] <Slim_Lipid> all fall to monke ⚡💪🦍
[1:53:03] <Tracazoid> Are they Western or Eastern Dragons as well
[1:53:04] <peachy996> fuck it
[1:53:05] <%Prevot> sometime they got no wings at all and still called dragons
[1:53:10] <peachy996> everything is dragon
[1:53:10] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @aram909 only if she dies
[1:53:12] <%Prevot> sometimes they're fucking horses
[1:53:14] <%mundanelotus> Dont wyverns have arms/wings while dragons have 4 legs and wings
[1:53:15] <velgaduere> wyrms are effectively ancient dragons
[1:53:17] <andre11dr> In this universe some Dragons have 4 wings, some have 2
[1:53:21] <+Shishi1205> but she has estus juice
[1:53:21] <Treasure_Vault> Might be worth dealing with the firekeeper, for her soul? Not sure
[1:53:26] <dundore77> why does he not want a free stronger estus
[1:53:28] <mikesapartment> she's useless. buff your flask
[1:53:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> Yep
[1:53:31] <+Shishi1205> incorrect
[1:53:32] <%Prevot> nope
[1:53:36] <Hozak> Nope
[1:53:39] <+Shishi1205> we tried this last time
[1:53:40] <+Shishi1205> woolie
[1:53:40] <%Xaeveax> What is the airspeed velocity of a dragon?
[1:53:41] <Anderobot> The whole legs/wings classification didn’t exist until like the 80s. Medieval Europeans didn’t give a fuck what their “dragons” looked like
[1:53:42] <%Reverend_Roscoe> wrong
[1:53:43] <%Prevot> it takes you to anor londo bonfire
[1:53:43] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Didnt you test it already and was proven wrong?
[1:53:46] <velgaduere> might as well go for estus +5 at this point
[1:53:47] <Raldavar> wyrms are super old dragons though
[1:53:47] <sothatsprettybrutal> didn't we already do this and it takes you to the anor londo one
[1:53:51] <%Reverend_Roscoe> it takea you to anor londo
[1:53:52] <andre11dr> Yeah you should kill her ,buff your flask
[1:53:52] <%Ensign_Epic> Nah, man. Game sets your homeward flag to Anor Londo bonfire
[1:53:56] <%MajorCrasher> sunlight altar

[1:54:00] <AbnormalVoid> yea, Parish

[1:54:11] <nxflre> @Reverend_Roscoe which doesnt work rn so it finee
[1:54:17] <AbnormalVoid> ohhh, right

[1:54:18] <sothatsprettybrutal> not that it matters w/e
[1:54:20] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus you proved this in this LP btw
[1:54:21] <foghornleghorn55> god that warp ui is terrible
[1:54:25] <andre11dr> He could kill the Fair Lady as well for a better Estus
[1:54:30] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @nxflre it does work, the firekeeper is still alive
[1:54:31] <%atlasdotwav> Altair he runs away
[1:54:33] <+Shishi1205> the first time Reggie came out
[1:54:37] <nxflre> guys AL BF is offlinee because it dark in ALA
[1:54:39] <seydaq> the respawn points get weird after dark
[1:54:40] <Treasure_Vault> Why are you not killing the firekeeper? You're keeping your estus weaker, right?
[1:54:42] <+Shishi1205> In this one
[1:54:45] <+Shishi1205> not yours
[1:54:45] <@Menitta> that lp was 5 years ago LUL
[1:54:45] <DSD24> Its been a bit

[1:54:58] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 Reggie also did on his second trip from the Painted World
[1:55:00] <%Javaa01> Yeah the painted world isn't on the map, so they have to give you a replacement bonfire when you come out, otherwise it would teleport you to an invalid coordinate
[1:55:00] <velgaduere> gotta run further down
[1:55:01] <sothatsprettybrutal> no you proved in _this_ one
[1:55:02] <Dopamien> yea remember everything all the time calebStare

[2:06:25] <Arqartur0> FAQS
[2:06:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> his disdain for people is the only true motive
[2:06:37] <robobeau> First Patches was down with the AK, and now I see you on a video with Michel'le?
[2:06:38] <cs0402196> this man replaced his teeth so he could spit bars
[2:06:38] <nxflre> whaat they doin?
[2:06:40] <BlueEagle2395> its ok Reggie, the game really tries to influence you to kill him before this
[2:06:42] <+AlucardX60> Heartbreaking, the worst person you know just made a really good point.
[2:06:42] <%BisoromiBear> real mothafuckin p's
[2:06:48] <%atlasdotwav> It's canon that Patches wrote the DS wiki

[2:07:10] <youngking_kush> Patches 1st language is FACTS
[2:07:12] <$JobbedBone> the patches tsundere arc is complete
[2:07:13] <emptyantics> Fuck Patches but the man spits facts

[2:07:37] <peachy996> Whatever he does, it's working
[2:07:37] <robobeau> Patches never had dinner with the President
[2:07:39] <%Xaeveax> Dark Souls 3 really hits home how important Patches is, especially post-DLC
[2:07:39] <athuramn> he's the embodiment of chaos
[2:07:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> He loves it
[2:07:40] <%Javaa01> He is motivated by the promise of FAT stacks
[2:07:41] <scrumbotime> I think he just loves to do scams and tricks, but he's not EVIL evil. Just a bastard a little.
[2:07:42] <brunoberserk> talk to petrus now
[2:07:46] <Darren716> He wants to keep it real
[2:07:47] <sothatsprettybrutal> reggie should totally just kill him anyway

[2:07:55] <nxflre> @Xaeveax hee is?
[2:07:56] <Supabait> Patches: Fuck Clerics, all my homies hate Clerics
[2:08:00] <%tigerfang86> but he is ALSO greedy
[2:08:01] <andre11dr> Patches is unbeatable, my man made it to the END OF THE WORLD
[2:08:06] <%Prevot> sounds like bullshit
[2:08:07] <Bromosap1ens> I love Patches as the voice of Miyazaki in the final DLC for DaS3
[2:08:11] <velgaduere> @tigerfang86 says who?
[2:08:12] <+Shishi1205> patches the unbreakable

[2:09:01] <$JobbedBone> You only deserve his honesty if he views you as an equal. Once you best him, you've earned it. Before that he talks to you differently
[2:09:02] <Hozak> In Elden Ring his name is Porches and he's one of those pot guys.
[2:09:02] <youngking_kush> That was a double entendre lol
[2:09:03] <+eanscrale> You don't have to like him, but he will keep it real either way

[2:22:42] <%justcallmebobplease> I just showed up, has Reggie beaten Artorias already?
[2:22:43] <+eanscrale> Yeah faith is for assholes, losers, and the betrayed.
[2:22:46] <%SaintBeau> @Solidus_113 remember lightning in DS2 launch
[2:22:48] <%MrATheGreat> There's a theory that the faith was the ones who cut bonfire lady's ankles and cut out  her tongue screw them
[2:22:53] <@Solidus_113> DLC literally has not started yet
[2:22:55] <time_axis> the firekeeper's okay
[2:22:58] <huskarl_zap> it doesn't make sense how miracles still work after the gods die
[2:22:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> she was nice, if a bit haughty
[2:22:59] <BurdRightsActivist> TRUE KEKW
[2:22:59] <andre11dr> In BB arcane is literally Space gods juice that plagues everyone

[2:23:12] <tolloponik> once you become holy enough you end up hating them in this game
[2:23:16] <+Shishi1205> So there was no second spear
[2:23:17] <+Shishi1205> huh
[2:23:18] <velgaduere> Maiden AstRHEA? *X-Files theme*
[2:23:20] <klooswep> She literally had to leave the church in order to become the realest one
[2:23:21] <justlikehumans> yeah, but you do get lightning powers, it evens out
[2:23:29] <+Shishi1205> My memory didnt fail me
[2:23:42] <andre11dr> What does he drop

[2:26:02] <%RemedyofRevenge> It takes a real one to link the fire at the cookout @WoolieVersus
[2:26:04] <%patriotrenegade> @A_German_spy why does Manus have teeth on his hand
[2:26:15] <BurdRightsActivist> @patriotrenegade he's very hungry :)
[2:26:24] <+Shishi1205> @patriotrenegade abyss
[2:26:33] <%patriotrenegade> I dont like the clicking noise Manus' teeth make
[2:26:38] <+hypemaster19> It is satisfying
[2:26:46] <%justcallmebobplease> ...This is legitimately bothering me now - who was I watching/what did I dream...
[2:26:55] <+Sir_Louis> @patriotrenegade thats what happens when you masturbate

[2:31:16] <TheBlackestBaron> F?
[2:31:16] <Dopamien> shes naked somewhere Kreygasm
[2:31:16] <jackelzxaa> she didnt drown she's just frolicking naked through the forest
[2:31:19] <%atlasdotwav> She can't swim bro
[2:31:19] <jackelzxaa> turning into a tree
[2:31:19] <tolloponik> more like got bloodborne around
[2:31:20] <%justcallmebobplease> READ CROWN
[2:31:21] <%cubbywolf> TELL ME THE P
[2:31:22] <derap41> But it does mean she's nude
[2:31:25] <%cubbywolf> lore
[2:31:28] <time_axis> crown is way too good for how bad it looks
[2:31:29] <Pechugaman> More like Olaaytiger am I right
[2:31:32] <sothatsprettybrutal> put that shit on
[2:31:34] <youngking_kush> Crown is powerful but ugly
[2:31:39] <%patriotrenegade> but it looks dumb as shit
[2:31:39] <%cubbywolf> win win
[2:31:41] <AbnormalVoid> BIG POWER
[2:31:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...wait, so did it fit her baby head?
[2:31:46] <ArvidOnFire> Magic CLUTCH
[2:31:47] <+Shishi1205> 20%
[2:31:49] <andre11dr> That's a really give set for magic users ,but it looks like shit on dudes
[2:31:50] <sothatsprettybrutal> boar arc 2 over
[2:31:50] <subjectg> wanna wear the pretty princess hat?
[2:31:52] <%cubbywolf> BE A PRETTY MADAME
[2:31:56] <tolloponik> nore head or garbage
[2:31:58] <deeriojim> Caveman reggie can finally become pretty princess Reggue
[2:32:00] <tolloponik> bore
[2:32:00] <Dopamien> the real trade off is the fashion
[2:32:02] <derap41> Glass canon
[2:32:17] <%cubbywolf> kawai desu
[2:32:19] <%vVAstrAVv> its not even a tradeoff unless youre in the dukes archive
[2:32:21] <dundore77> but it also looks super silly
[2:32:22] <Grim1952> Meanwhile manus is just hanging by the portal
[2:32:25] <%RemedyofRevenge> but its only magic dmg that gets increased on yourself, so not too hard a trade off
[2:32:33] <tolloponik> that doesn't feel worth it
[2:32:37] <subjectg> note that it’s magic damage ONLY, so there’s only very few things that it’ll affect
[2:32:39] <sothatsprettybrutal> heaven forbid the game actually display the effects of its items
[2:32:41] <Awesome_Leaf> super worth it if youre down to look so dumb
[2:32:41] <%holydeviant1> oh man, dark sorceries ahead, I almost forgot
[2:32:42] <%RemedyofRevenge> its worth it imo
[2:32:43] <AbnormalVoid> and it stacks with bellowing
[2:32:45] <Reveresao> Only glass canon against Magic and there are not a lot of those
[2:32:49] <%atlasdotwav> It's dumb bc why isn't it around the forehead LUL
[2:32:51] <%Indigo_Automaton> It looks like those crappy arrow through the head props
[2:32:54] <AbnormalVoid> depends if the enemy uses magic at all
[2:32:55] <Dopamien> would this affect the sword swings?
[2:32:58] <%holydeviant1> Welded on
[2:32:59] <youngking_kush> @a_german_spy Does Crown effect MLGS?
[2:32:59] <%vVAstrAVv> @tolloponik it is MAAAASSIVELY worth it
[2:33:03] <Grim1952> It's not a phase mom
[2:33:05] <tetrabrick1lt> NUMBER GO UP
[2:33:05] <AbnormalVoid> no magic damage, no magic problem
[2:33:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the boar helm is reggie's mando helmet
[2:33:15] <Darren716> Wear that crown, it's dope
[2:33:17] <sothatsprettybrutal> this is the way oink oink
[2:33:24] <%superc37> reggie im like 90 percent certain theres nothing left in the base game or the dlc that deals magic damage
[2:33:27] <nxflre> @cobalt_phoenix_ This is the way
[2:33:31] <deeriojim> its pretty though
[2:33:33] <AbnormalVoid> Pretty Princess Reggie
[2:33:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ This is the way
[2:33:37] <yukichocomilk> I like her outfit as fashion souls
[2:33:42] <+Ryukashin94> just back did he beat nito?
[2:33:44] <%holydeviant1> @superc37 There are casters in the DLC
[2:33:44] <%RemedyofRevenge> I love mixing the paladin, antiquated, and maiden sets for fashion
[2:33:48] <%atlasdotwav> I hope oolacile isn't gonna come back as a hard area later on in the series

[2:42:18] <velgaduere> sure is Reggie
[2:42:20] <nxflre> @Bromosap1ens yeah I've aalways recuiteed for them
[2:42:20] <StebTheVee> phrasing
[2:42:21] <iamtheTwitchghost> get deep in that butt
[2:42:23] <+Mrbaconator> "it's hard to get in the butt" - reggie
[2:42:23] <Dementdrenegade> Try Finger
[2:42:25] <Afrosamasenpai> get that butt reggie
[2:42:30] <+liquidzr0> shofuSus
[2:42:31] <Papa_Shu> nice stagger
[2:42:32] <%robosqueeb> but once you can YOURE IN
[2:42:33] <%FallenAngelZelos> he's gonna work so hard for it and then be so disappointed by it.
[2:42:35] <andre11dr> This is one of the hader tails to get ,you only get so many chances
[2:42:36] <peachy996> You know who was cool
[2:42:37] <%patriotrenegade> try finger, but hole
[2:42:40] <peachy996> True Ogre
[2:42:43] <Bromosap1ens> @nxflre Yeah. I've even recurited for the cut then died on purpose to get the solo win.
[2:42:43] <velgaduere> you already hit it once
[2:42:44] <Enn19> "Try finger but whole?"
[2:42:48] <+Bitscreed> ♫You've got 99 options but a sip ain't one.♫
[2:42:49] <+Reaverund> Gotta shed that armor like silver chariot
[2:42:50] <+cdrom321> For a few seconds, he was locked on, and suddenly doing so much better.
[2:42:51] <%MajorCrasher> the tail weapon is kinda Garbo tbh
[2:42:52] <%Lion_kun> I am so excited for Kalameets tail
[2:43:09] <+Shishi1205> bait the dive
[2:43:09] <%patriotrenegade> This fight wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for how the lightning lingers in the water
[2:43:10] <BurdRightsActivist> Watch the tail! Watch the tail! WHELPS
[2:43:11] <tolloponik> there are only 2 attacks that will allow that cut for melee
[2:43:11] <sothatsprettybrutal> can the soul spear pierce hit it?
[2:43:16] <agustorm123> Clapped
[2:43:18] <LunarRemix> Reggie's a hero. Most people don't bother with his tail
[2:43:18] <+hypemaster19> ResidentSleeper
[2:43:19] <leeroyzehn> rekt
[2:43:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> combo-d
[2:43:23] <andre11dr> Tho Kalamet is the most annoying tale to get, witch sucks cause it gives my favorite dragon weapon
[2:43:24] <Afrosamasenpai> headbutto
[2:43:24] <AbnormalVoid> shmoovin
[2:43:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> and it's also a snake
[2:43:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you have to wait for that charge move, it's the only safe way to get the tail
[2:43:30] <+Shishi1205> @sothatsprettybrutal free aiming it
[2:43:31] <+megaman_sentinel> yes only 2
[2:43:32] <+hypemaster19> YES

[2:43:39] <%ThePich> Reggie The Tailchaser
[2:43:42] <%atlasdotwav> There are 3 chances I've seen
[2:43:42] <%patriotrenegade> what if>
[2:43:43] <agustorm123> Please poeple believe so I get more points LUL
[2:43:46] <Awesome_Leaf> Just pull a no scope like vs the lobster LUL
[2:43:49] <+Jiggisnipe> gotta hit it
[2:43:50] <tolloponik> this is why tail cuts are no longer a thing in souls games
[2:43:56] <ChoculaUltra> thinking about how unique the Sanc Guardian is in the context of the whole series. I think the only other Lion motif/design is Ornstein's helmet? Is there a huge lore significance about lions in DS?
[2:44:01] <deeriojim> No Scope nr 2 Reggie?
[2:44:09] <Karhax> too bad the weapon isn't great

[2:47:19] <Equirah> @Darren716 it's not, the tail is
[2:47:20] <%holydeviant1> I love how he runs when he flies, it's so silly
[2:47:23] <deeriojim> Reggie is a right little kitty toy this round
[2:47:23] <Jaxnos> this is what it looked like that one time my cat caught a mouse
[2:47:34] <subjectg> @darren716 he has no issue, he can kill it really easily, it’s just he wants the tail cut

[2:49:34] <konarius> isn't ankle high water is enough to get extra lighting damage in 1?
[2:49:36] <andre11dr> Finally i win one ,i just have to much faith in him LUL
[2:49:38] <youngking_kush> You could try some Stam Recovery stuff

[2:49:49] <youngking_kush> So you have the Stam when you're behind him

[2:50:30] <KayleNikita> @tolloponik oh god limesLUL
[2:50:30] <+Jiggisnipe> almost
[2:50:32] <+dawsfloss> that armor isnt helping be better off just doing a nood run for max rolls
[2:50:36] <su6human> it’s easily the cheapest enemy in the game tbh, that shit belongs in sekiro or bloodborne not das1
[2:50:41] <LunarRemix> Is Reggie still wearing the Flame defense ring from when he fought the Hellkite?
[2:50:45] <andre11dr> Kalamite is going to the worst, even pros struggle to that tail
[2:50:48] <DeathByPoke7> apply directly to the forehead
[2:50:57] <%livlinn> reminds me of sekiro monke
[2:50:58] <sothatsprettybrutal> reggie must be a dragon cause this lightning is fucking him up
[2:50:58] <Sypheck> if he just wants the tail he should just commit to fast roll then switch back after
[2:51:03] <+Mrbaconator> damn he's good
[2:51:04] <Darren716> I never even bothered with Kals tail
[2:51:05] <dundore77> gotta find the range that makes him want to dash
[2:51:10] <%cubbywolf> running won't save you now
[2:51:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:51:11] <subjectg> @andre11dr it’s not too hard, but it does take a long ass time since you need that one attack
[2:51:12] <agustorm123> Reggie keeps fighting but he should use his magic
[2:51:13] <%livlinn> he agile
[2:51:21] <youngking_kush> Kal has the hardest tail IMO
[2:51:22] <%CateHecate> this weapon sucks lmao

[2:51:44] <AbnormalVoid> the lesson of this entire DLC is "better have fast rolls, bitch"
[2:51:45] <Dementdrenegade> nah, he just has to kindle and he'll be alright lol
[2:51:46] <%jamsbybetty> boss boosed

[2:51:57] <%jamsbybetty> all 4 lords are ded
[2:51:58] <agustorm123> yeah but remember he no scoped the arm of the boss last time
[2:52:01] <deeriojim> Fastball Special with Guardian and Reggarth
[2:52:03] <+Peterbyte_> all 5

[2:52:27] <GHouseduivel> barbBet
[2:52:33] <LunarRemix> I think Reggie might still be wearing the Flame defense ring

[2:53:26] <StebTheVee> close call

[2:55:06] <Josef_Stryker> Is the tail even worth it?
[2:55:09] <LunarRemix> Hell no
[2:55:12] <LunarRemix> It's a whip
[2:55:12] <@Solidus_113> you know there's another chance to get the tail weapon later
[2:55:14] <Josef_Stryker> The Moonlight Greatsword I understand
[2:55:18] <%illtima> You can cut the tail with Crystal spear if you hit him from the back
[2:55:20] <Josef_Stryker> But not this idiot
[2:55:30] <deeriojim> Now it is personal though
[2:55:30] <sozemd> The dlc is like required fast roll
[2:55:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> alright I'm going ALL IN BABY
[2:55:31] <BettyMwwaahh> @Solidus_113 its even harder later i would say
[2:55:31] <agustorm123> dude I had like 1k now I have 8k with this only boss LUL
[2:55:34] <+patel347> might be a beter idea to use a faster weapon?
[2:55:41] <subjectg> @solidus_113 i think woolie enjoys this
[2:55:41] <ChoculaUltra> I believe dammit
[2:55:42] <konarius> wouldn't the pole hit the tail?
[2:55:45] <%gulthrax> you need a foolproof batman plan bro
[2:55:52] <andre11dr> Welp i just went all in ,pray to god he doesn't get it LUL
[2:55:52] <deeriojim> oh poison? I thought he had toxin
[2:55:52] <Reveresao> There was 5 seconds LEFT SCAM!
[2:55:55] <legacy0117> I think he wants the Monster Hunter tail get respect.
[2:56:25] <BurdRightsActivist> He's not gonna get it until he stops being weird about kindling
[2:56:34] <Dementdrenegade> ^
[2:56:35] <%cubbywolf> reggie also dodges away when he needs to dodge towards
[2:56:37] <%MajorCrasher> so close
[2:56:39] <velgaduere> that wide swing ain't doin it chief
[2:56:40] <Papa_Shu> K I N D L E
[2:56:42] <%WutangchickeN> GIMME THA MONEYYYYY
[2:56:44] <andre11dr> NICE
[2:56:45] <lord_of_the_dragons> I sniped seathe's tail with soul spears CoolCat
[2:56:45] <youngking_kush> He's soooooo aggressive
[2:56:50] <%justcallmebobplease> BE
[2:56:54] <%justcallmebobplease> AGRESSIVE
[2:56:55] <%justcallmebobplease> B
[2:56:56] <%patriotrenegade> You gotta WANT it
[2:56:58] <%justcallmebobplease> E
[2:57:02] <%justcallmebobplease> AGRESSIVE
[2:57:03] <%BignanasTheGawd> Is the tail a good weapon?
[2:57:04] <Sapientiae> vertical swings are better for cutting too
[2:57:11] <subjectg> GIVE IT UP FOR ROUND 10
[2:57:11] <%CateHecate> no lol
[2:57:12] <anthropomorphictempest> kindle that bonfire bro
[2:57:14] <%justcallmebobplease> @BignanasTheGawd I mean it's a whip.
[2:57:18] <%holydeviant1> @BignanasTheGawd hahahahah no
[2:57:22] <%CateHecate> its so bad
[2:57:23] <agustorm123> I like the one guy keeping the faith
[2:57:23] <%Prevot> if he's not gonna block, he should put grass Crest shield on
[2:57:25] <%BignanasTheGawd> Good to know
[2:57:25] <Equirah> yo, give us time to bet
[2:57:29] <urkleturtle> i think reggie still hasn't internalized that hitting its ass and not the actual tail doesn't do shit
[2:57:31] <deeriojim> @BignanasTheGawd now its not about the tail now its about the pride
[2:57:31] <KeiganOfAstora> Damn
[2:57:32] <Estuko> Just one girlie at the tourney and it's kill or be killed
[2:57:35] <%cubbywolf> why would you sip there, attack!
[2:57:36] <sozemd> Whip is cheese
[2:57:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL LUL LUL
[2:57:44] <%SaintBeau> TWO HAND
[2:57:45] <%cubbywolf> two hands bruh
[2:57:46] <KaiserMario> 2H
[2:57:46] <ChoculaUltra> I started this stream with 800k FeelsBadMan
[2:57:51] <$nodnerbuil> mayhaps take off some armour and ninja-roll it?
[2:57:53] <+Jiggisnipe> so committing to the tail and ignoring a heal might be the move
[2:57:57] <KeiganOfAstora> Just got back from booster shot, what did he do after killing the Drake?
[2:58:01] <nxflre> would be eaasier with more heals Reggie. He always seems to forget about kindling until Woolie mentions it lol
[2:58:02] <Equirah> it didn't, hit the leg
[2:58:04] <%holydeviant1> Tell Reggie this isn't his only chance for the tail, you can fight him later!
[2:58:08] <%holydeviant1> (hheheheheh)
[2:58:09] <%MajorCrasher> man that sword is just way too slow
[2:58:14] <KayleNikita> i'm waiting for him to drop to fast roll luaLUL
[2:58:15] <agustorm123> That shield is only for looks
[2:58:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1473170438847090689
[2:58:22] <youngking_kush> @keiganofastora Played "Find the DLC"
[2:58:23] <%SaintBeau> @KeiganOfAstora nice got my booster today too. he's just been fighting this guy
[2:58:25] <Equirah> @MajorCrasher the roll is too slow*
[2:58:28] <Hozak> So how about them nicks?
[2:58:28] <andre11dr> Reggie really needs to two hand ,his not blocking him that much
[2:58:30] <KaiserMario> It should be easier with the catch pole
[2:58:31] <%xeromage> Every single opportunity is lost to a roll or a sip
[2:58:38] <subjectg> it’s not slow, reggie’s getting the opportunities but hasn’t acted yet
[2:58:40] <%cubbywolf> gg
[2:58:48] <%gulthrax> switch out your kit, bro
[2:58:54] <Papa_Shu> god I love that animation, where your shield is hit so hard you just go flying
[2:58:55] <Josef_Stryker> FREE. MONEY.
[2:58:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOPE
[2:58:58] <agustorm123> keep going I want more
[2:59:07] <+Jiggisnipe> his opportunity needs to go straight for tail, can't heal or do an extra roll
[2:59:09] <%cubbywolf> free money
[2:59:09] <youngking_kush> Grass Crest Shield bro
[2:59:15] <BurdRightsActivist> Please just kindle Reg
[2:59:15] <nxflre> MOAR HEEALS TOO
[2:59:20] <El_Rabbit> M O N E Y
[2:59:21] <BurdRightsActivist> ResidentSleeper
[2:59:25] <%cubbywolf> needs to get gud
[2:59:26] <+swesterly> Catch pole move set may be better for getting the tail
[2:59:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DOLLA DOLLA
[2:59:32] <NumbF4ke> changing back to demon catchpole might be good too, since it swings vertically
[2:59:35] <nxflre> or use some lightning ddeef
[2:59:35] <agustorm123> Or hear me out use the shield
[2:59:41] <velgaduere> catchpole will absolutely solve this problem
[2:59:44] <andre11dr> This is just free money at this point
[2:59:46] <+Jiggisnipe> oh well
[2:59:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> wow
[2:59:49] <+Jiggisnipe> there it was
[2:59:49] <%gulthrax> Reggie is stubborn as a mule
[2:59:49] <deeriojim> Shielding on the roar wave isnt the best idea though, the shield stagger lasts longer than when your shield is down
[2:59:52] <%romulux420> romulux420 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:59:58] <BurdRightsActivist> NO KINDLE ANDY
[3:00:02] <%cubbywolf> also dodge closer to where he will land
[3:00:06] <konarius> tail goes up faster then great swort start up mang
[3:00:10] <%Javaa01> Fun Fact: The Artorias DLC was being made as Bloodborne went into production, so that's why this boss feels like a much later Souls boss
[3:00:10] <agustorm123> yeah shield every atack Kappa

[3:00:38] <youngking_kush> @javaa01 Theres literally a Bloodborneman here lol
[3:00:39] <+Byr0nX> How did one of Bayo's  bosses get out?
[3:00:42] <yukichocomilk> I'm shocked reggie has never tried fast roll LUL
[3:00:55] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus since reggie is basically just resetting the fight he can quit out after he runs out of estus
[3:01:00] <%Javaa01> @youngking_kush Yeah, but it's gonna be a second until we see him
[3:01:01] <%Deasmeister> good lightning block would be needed for blocking no?
[3:01:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[3:01:04] <agustorm123> Bayo bosses getting turbo
[3:01:18] <+Shishi1205> Gotta awaken the magneto in him
[3:01:24] <%holydeviant1> No joke, he can shoot for the tail on round two
[3:01:26] <LunarRemix> Perfecto
[3:01:26] <+Shishi1205> DIVEKICK
[3:01:29] <Afrosamasenpai> That thing, that thing, that thiii-iii-iiiing
[3:01:30] <ChoculaUltra> that dodge was cinematic af

[3:01:53] <agustorm123> Thats the timing

[3:02:02] <+Shishi1205> @Prevot 100% feeling this
[3:02:06] <+Shishi1205> some MHFU monster
[3:02:08] <+Byr0nX> you dont get two, just one ice cream

[3:02:15] <%xyxlzyzm> ded
[3:02:22] <Bromosap1ens> TWO SCOOPZ?!
[3:02:22] <legacy0117> He had fast flip roll for a little bit, but his preference for chunky armor is evident.

[3:51:44] <iamtheTwitchghost> 30fps tho
[3:51:46] <tolloponik> in prrject beast
[3:51:46] <youngking_kush> lmao
[3:51:49] <%FallenAngelZelos> i'm uncomfortable
[3:51:49] <oneimportantthing> Woolie you must talk to your wife like this
[3:51:49] <zashrin777> YES
[3:51:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I DO
[3:51:50] <Darren716> Man BB would've been in production when this came out wouldn't it?
[3:51:52] <fat_burtreynolds> “Does it come in fps 60?”
[3:51:55] <waltzqueen> I DO
[3:51:57] <subjectg> “Go buy a Ps4, fucker, mwah hah ah ha”
[3:51:57] <AbnormalVoid> no :)
[3:51:57] <DSD24> Do you like Eyes on the Inside
[3:51:59] <Hozak> It's not.
[3:52:00] <youngking_kush> Issa Blunderbuss
[3:52:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Darren716 yes
[3:52:03] <+Bitscreed> @fat_burtreynolds "Nooooooooooooo"
[3:52:03] <%BignanasTheGawd> Every blood has its borne
[3:52:03] <%Javaa01> It genuinely is
[3:52:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> BLUD
[3:52:05] <anthropomorphictempest> We love that so much
[3:52:06] <+liquidzr0> gawd i need blodborne on PC
[3:52:08] <velgaduere> this DLC was made during early development of BB
[3:52:08] <+eanscrale> Actually he's more like cut content from Demon's weirdly enough
[3:52:09] <@Solidus_113> October 2012 is when this came out
[3:52:09] <%Prevot> "Do you like bad frame pacing?"
[3:52:10] <emptyantics> EYES ON THE INSIDE
[3:52:10] <Equirah> do you like sexy slimmy girls?
[3:52:11] <JdotSweapA> OOOCELOOOOT
[3:52:12] <andre11dr> "Don't worry, i definitely never seen an alien"
[3:52:14] <Hozak> It's apparently not, according to data mining
[3:52:15] <oak120> Its a proto bloodbourne guy
[3:52:15] <peachy996> I do
[3:52:16] <sirrice77> I can't wait for reggie to get to bloodborne
[3:52:17] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! This voice is uncomfortable.
[3:52:18] <%patriotrenegade> Chester was put in the game before bloodborne started development even supposedly
[3:52:20] <%FallenAngelZelos> LUL
[3:52:20] <zashrin777> Bloodborne on pc please for the love of god!
[3:52:21] <Afrosamasenpai> Same
[3:52:23] <peachy996> Actually yeah
[3:52:23] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[3:52:26] <youngking_kush> Bloodborne is indeed the best
[3:52:26] <%SaintBeau> bloodborne is the best, DS1 is my favorite
[3:52:27] <%MooseIsGoose> I think he is from bloodborne
[3:52:27] <klooswep> Time is convoluted in FromSoft HQ
[3:52:28] <KyberNasse> Do you like screaming dogs?
[3:52:30] <peachy996> The bosses and this man
[3:52:30] <+Baldzinga> I just want Bloodborne at 60fps. Please.
[3:52:31] <Bromosap1ens> Zullie deconfirmed it a bit though. He was in the game before the DLC and was in the base game
[3:52:32] <%atlasdotwav> This voice should be the default
[3:52:33] <oneimportantthing> Bloodborne 2 has to happen
[3:52:37] <Hozak> He's got more in common with some enemies and such from Demon Souls
[3:52:37] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Also Demon's Souls Ministers
[3:52:39] <peachy996> I love BB
[3:52:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> and aliiiiiiiiiens
[3:52:40] <%xyxlzyzm> bloodborne has the best fashion hands down
[3:52:41] <+sewermonk> PILE fuckin BUNKERS
[3:52:42] <%kewlmyc> Bloodborne on PC NEVER
[3:52:42] <@Solidus_113> and CANNONS
[3:52:43] <SoaringTrumpet> the opposite for me
[3:52:44] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Dark Souls 2 best souls
[3:52:44] <%paladinstarbuster> EDGE
[3:52:45] <anthropomorphictempest> "Do you like eating umbilical cords?"
[3:52:45] <available_line> Bloodborne is cool
[3:52:46] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is also my favorite
[3:52:50] <+terry_quest> I like both
[3:52:51] <%SaintBeau> @Cryomancer_Maurice based
[3:52:52] <+dekkitout> Shout out to the heroes who do Arcane/Bloodtinge only runs
[3:52:52] <Aydarkzero> why not both Kappa
[3:52:54] <zashrin777> Lovecratian shit is awesome!
[3:52:55] <peachy996> The music in BB is glorious
[3:52:56] <oneimportantthing> BB is forever trapped in 30 fps hell
[3:52:58] <Dotados> BB is the best, hope it was 60fps though
[3:52:59] <karawra> bloodborne is my favorite
[3:52:59] <Darren716> Woolie you still gotta crawl through 120 hours of DS2 before you get to BB
[3:53:01] <%BignanasTheGawd> All opinions are valid? Then he’s our dad from the future
[3:53:03] <@Solidus_113> shotgun parry a giant pig ass
[3:53:03] <%Prevot> BB>DS1>DS3>DeS>DS2
[3:53:06] <andre11dr> DeS is my personal favorite but Bloodborne is the best one
[3:53:06] <huskarl_zap> chester child molester
[3:53:07] <youngking_kush> BB has my favorite boss fight of all time
[3:53:07] <fairore> oh
[3:53:09] <sothatsprettybrutal> man i can't believe they put a reference to Lies of P way back in dark souls 1
[3:53:09] <%hiswill98> Sekiro is my favorite but I understand why that’s an unpopular opinion
[3:53:09] <%Vigonept> bht dark souls 3 tho
[3:53:10] <Equirah> ehhhhh, maybe you're missing the road
[3:53:10] <%SaintBeau> reggie, no.
[3:53:11] <Dabrikishaw> You still have DS2 to go through Reggie
[3:53:11] <+Silioth> Bloodborne would be my favourite but maaan does it ruin itself for me with very little things.
[3:53:12] <%kewlmyc> BB will remain in my top 5 favorite games for decades to come
[3:53:12] <+セビー> i ran arcane, it was fun
[3:53:12] <+eanscrale> when are you coming to PC chester???
[3:53:13] <%Juriasu> FrankerZ
[3:53:13] <%paladinstarbuster> IS IT?
[3:53:13] <%justcallmebobplease> @oneimportantthing Stop speaking fell truths.
[3:53:13] <%jamsbybetty> bloodborne runs like ass molasses unfortunately
[3:53:13] <KayleNikita> i gotta love the victorian era, glad to see someone else does as well
[3:53:17] <subjectg> Ya like dags?
[3:53:19] <%patriotrenegade> nice
[3:53:20] <oak120> SAFE
[3:53:20] <peachy996> Almost every boss theme in BB stomps on this game
[3:53:20] <tolloponik> @oneimportantthing it's being made by blue point, fromsoft is not making it though so the art direction and lore is going to suck
[3:53:22] <%SirGO0SE> And ayleeuns

[3:53:45] <%holydeviant1> >rock lands on the edge of his ledge >Oh, not a death!
[3:53:48] <peachy996> I am SO ready for you guys to do Bloodborne someday
[3:53:51] <youngking_kush> Everything about that boss is amazing
[3:53:55] <%SaintBeau> DS1 is infinitely better than DS3
[3:53:59] <oneimportantthing> Reggie loves throwing rocks
[3:54:01] <deeriojim> shortcut unlocked
[3:54:01] <nxflre> SHORTCUT PORN
[3:54:03] <+terry_quest> shortcut get
[3:54:03] <available_line> Are we close to Guts?
[3:54:03] <%atlasdotwav> Is this short cut pr0n
[3:54:07] <oneimportantthing> I kinda hated DS3
[3:54:08] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DS1 is better than DS3
[3:54:08] <%patriotrenegade> DS3 is so much cooler
[3:54:09] <klooswep> OM>GW>TF>BB>Q
[3:54:09] <Johannen> DS1>BB>Sekiro...dont care bout else
[3:54:10] <Sunstalker> This is alvina's spot
[3:54:12] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DS3 is overrated
[3:54:16] <%Javaa01> And now you can skip the entire second half of this zone
[3:54:18] <youngking_kush> @saintbeau DS1 has higher has, but DS3 is more consistent
[3:54:20] <agustorm123> BB is top tier
[3:54:21] <glass_marcus> ds3 is consistent good
[3:54:22] <+dekkitout> I like ds3 cinders too much to go back
[3:54:25] <$nodnerbuil> DS3 is pretty good, about as good as DS1 IMO
[3:54:26] <youngking_kush> higher highs*
[3:54:28] <fantom_flasch> I like Zelda so I like Dark Souls 1
[3:54:28] <oneimportantthing> DS3 is such a soulless game even compared to DS2
[3:54:28] <+Bitscreed> Bone Home
[3:54:28] <zashrin777> Gotta say, watching an initiate play through the souls series is an amazing time. Falling for old traps and tricks, getting hype. Feels Goodman.
[3:54:29] <$nodnerbuil> both have ups and downs
[3:54:32] <+sewermonk> DS3 has a lot more polish but its polishing a big meh game
[3:54:33] <anthropomorphictempest> DS1's bosses aren't ALL THAT if we're being honest
[3:54:34] <%Prevot> DS3 would be better than 1 if it wasn't so linear, every other aspect of it is way better than 1
[3:54:37] <available_line> All DS games are good. DS2 is merely the least good.
[3:54:39] <+Shishi1205> @dekkitout try convergence
[3:54:39] <%BignanasTheGawd> Shortcut porn, shortcuts gone wild
[3:54:41] <%Vigonept> Ds3 doesnt have izalith or catacombs so it wins
[3:54:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1473170438847090689
[3:54:42] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus And 12k in the pocket
[3:54:43] <%SaintBeau> @youngking_kush DS3 has no character, it just lacks the magic that DS1 has
[3:54:47] <oda_flobunaga> DS3 Plays best, but DS1 takes more creative risks
[3:54:51] <Equirah> @Vigonept uhhhhh
[3:54:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean even if you accept that as the spread, the difference between first and last place is like the difference between an 8.2 and a 9.4
[3:54:56] <andre11dr> I'd argue the gameplay in DS3 is way better, PVE is kinda wack in DS1 honestly
[3:54:58] <Dementdrenegade> Might wanna kindle now LUL
[3:55:05] <oak120> If the second half bosses of DS1 were better, itd be no contest
[3:55:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Vigonept wuh
[3:55:08] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Ds3 suffers from what Dragon Age Inquisition does
[3:55:12] <peachy996> DS has the superior foundation
[3:55:16] <+セビー> DS2 is mechanically solid, but graphically muddy
[3:55:16] <oneimportantthing> DS3 is like a repurposed Bloodborne with more boring zones and lots of DS1 fanservice
[3:55:17] <youngking_kush> @saintbeau Idk man, stuff like the Dancers movement would beg to differ
[3:55:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no we're doing this again eh chat?
[3:55:20] <Hozak> I would say DS3 has a stronger overall experience
[3:55:20] <+sewermonk> any souls that gives you bonfire teleportation isnt a metroidvania like DS1
[3:55:21] <klooswep> Maybe the best soulsborne game was the friends we made along the way
[3:55:25] <%BisoromiBear> DS3 ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:55:28] <Hozak> DS1 tends to sort of drop off after Anor Londo
[3:55:29] <andre11dr> DS1 has superior level design tho
[3:55:30] <agustorm123> We can agree DS2 is really good
[3:55:32] <%SaintBeau> DS3 is just kind of boring
[3:55:36] <%SaintBeau> @agustorm123 agreed
[3:55:36] <peachy996> ehh
[3:55:38] <anthropomorphictempest> @agustorm123 DS2 is great
[3:55:39] <oneimportantthing> Hot Take: Dark Souls 2 is better than DS3
[3:55:40] <%NahmenJayden> DS3 Cinders for life
[3:55:42] <Deimos002> I also have opinions about Souls games
[3:55:43] <+Shishi1205> DS1 has the strongest level design
[3:55:45] <peachy996> MAjula theme in DS2 is good
[3:55:46] <%SaintBeau> @oneimportantthing 100%
[3:55:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> @klooswep nah, their questlines keep breaking half way through. Thanks From Soft
[3:55:48] <%Prevot> DS2 sucks major ass
[3:55:49] <andre11dr> DS2 has best build versatility
[3:55:49] <%RemedyofRevenge> My own tier list is 1, Demon, 2, 3 (I havent played bloodborne)
[3:55:51] <%SaintBeau> DS2>>DS3
[3:55:53] <velgaduere> END andyEyes
[3:55:54] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DS2 is an excellent game, but it gets shit on by people because it isn't comparable to the other souls games
[3:55:55] <prime_name> DS2 feels over designed in difficulty
[3:55:55] <available_line> DS3 has the best bosses though.
[3:55:57] <+Shishi1205> But DS3 has better gameplay
[3:55:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> DS3 has some of the best Bossfights and songs of the sereies
[3:55:58] <peachy996> Beautiful Theme that Majula theme
[3:55:59] <%Bread_Assassin> DS2 has some bonkers design choices, but it's still overall pretty good.
[3:56:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dark souls is a series of games and i like them
[3:56:03] <Awesome_Leaf> fight fight fight
[3:56:04] <foghornleghorn55> DS1 has better world design but the levels themselves aren't as well actualized as DS3.
[3:56:06] <%Irridium> DS1 has peaks and valleys while DS3 is more leveled overall. Doesn't have the highs of DS1, but doesn't have the lows either. And boy those lows are low.
[3:56:07] <%SaintBeau> Bloodborne is objectively the best, but DS1 is my fave
[3:56:10] <anthropomorphictempest> @andre11dr POWERSTANCING. Must I go on?
[3:56:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @nahmenjayden Also,check out The Convergence mod its as good as Cinders
[3:56:15] <%Vigonept> i like the franchise named dark and souls
[3:56:16] <urkleturtle> endurance is always good
[3:56:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus White Dragon Breath thou
[3:56:17] <%FallenAngelZelos> nerds are going in the chat
[3:56:17] <subjectg> I have a softspot for ds2 because it’s the only one with working PVP
[3:56:18] <%justcallmebobplease> I wonder how much people would like DS2, if it wasn't the one place to get powerstancing and legit PVP.  Like, if other DS games could offer both of those...
[3:56:18] <youngking_kush> DS2 is like "Hey I heard you kids like hard games???"
[3:56:19] <%chexmixisbest> SOTFS is fine, base DS2 is ass
[3:56:20] <oda_flobunaga> DS@ has really deep mechanics but poor encounter and boss design
[3:56:20] <DextralMalin> the dragon breath spell
[3:56:20] <fat_burtreynolds> Tatakae
[3:56:20] <Equirah> @agustorm123 some good ideas, some awful ideas, poor execution on both
[3:56:23] <tolloponik> whats the soft cap?
[3:56:24] <%BisoromiBear> DS2 is table scraps baked into a passable meatloaf
[3:56:24] <%NahmenJayden> @BallerSwagBro9k oh shit will do
[3:56:24] <%xyxlzyzm> get some fuckin HP on this lad
[3:56:26] <andre11dr> DS2 feels unfinished even more than the others
[3:56:30] <%SaintBeau> HOT TAKE: Dark Souls is a Good Game.
[3:56:30] <oneimportantthing> Absolutely nothing comes close to Majula's atmosphere
[3:56:30] <+Shishi1205> @BallerSwagBro9k It might be better than cinders
[3:56:31] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Ds2 has the best pvp and the most diverse options for weapons and fashion
[3:56:32] <agustorm123> Agree to disagree
[3:56:34] <+terry_quest> Elden ring is the best souls game and i havent even played it yet
[3:56:35] <carltonbankz> DS3 bosses are like 100x better than DS2 bosses
[3:56:35] <foghornleghorn55> DS3 also has much better bosses and gameplay
[3:56:38] <Treasure_Vault> DS2 is only a pretty good 8/10
[3:56:39] <+FirebirdXR> Dark Souls is the Dark Souls of the Dark Souls series!
[3:56:40] <klooswep> The important part is that people on the internet have opinions
[3:56:41] <%SaintBeau> CHAT WAR CHAT WAT
[3:56:41] <urkleturtle> white dragon breath
[3:56:41] <deeriojim> attune magic if you have a slot to spare, no reason not to
[3:56:42] <Dabrikishaw> 44 INT is fine
[3:56:42] <velgaduere> White Dragon Breath
[3:56:43] <+Shishi1205> its a spell
[3:56:43] <ghilbor> White dragon breath?
[3:56:43] <Johannen> wut
[3:56:44] <available_line> DS1 best level design. DS2 power stancing, DS3 best bosses
[3:56:44] <%Lion_kun> it was super cool
[3:56:46] <pi_in_the_sci> Dragon Beam is 50
[3:56:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @shishi1205 True
[3:56:54] <glass_marcus> just played through ds3, the bosses are elite
[3:56:55] <Dabrikishaw> White Dragon Breath isn't good
[3:56:58] <Darren716> White Breath is sooo good
[3:56:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> dragon breath
[3:57:02] <%Prevot> DS2 is like a whole game of post Anor Londor DS1 LUL
[3:57:02] <oak120> It has its uses
[3:57:03] <youngking_kush> Yeah its White Dragon Breath
[3:57:06] <%patriotrenegade> old hat
[3:57:07] <Darren716> It burns through people
[3:57:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OLD hat?
[3:57:13] <subjectg> Dragon breathe does massive damage but it sucks for pvp
[3:57:15] <fat_burtreynolds> Bingo
[3:57:15] <Darren716> And it has like 20 uses for 1 slot
[3:57:23] <%Javaa01> @cobalt_phoenix_ I mean, the dementia is hitting him pretty hard
[3:57:23] <klooswep> The big hero, old hat logan
[3:57:25] <+cdrom321> "Old Hat"?
[3:57:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> smh woolie the disrespect on the hat
[3:57:27] <+Bitscreed> The Big Hat is now Old Hat. He's yesterday's news.
[3:57:27] <+Shishi1205> yeah the 20 uses
[3:57:27] <dundore77> dont forget INT boosts weapon damage for him too
[3:57:28] <Dementdrenegade> i mean old hat is probably not incorrect :P
[3:57:30] <%SaintBeau> DS1>Bloodborne>Sekiro>Demon's Souls>DS2>DS3
[3:57:31] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:57:34] <sothatsprettybrutal> which just if he's forgetting he already has
[3:57:35] <Equirah> @available_line DS2 about to lose all relevance when ER comes out
[3:57:36] <%megaman_sentinel> right side
[3:57:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:57:37] <velgaduere> TRU
[3:57:38] <urkleturtle> hallwugging to the right is the fastest
[3:57:40] <youngking_kush> We surpass him
[3:57:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> old naked logan
[3:57:41] <foghornleghorn55> Grand Archives > Duke's archives
[3:57:43] <anthropomorphictempest> Why do they call him "Old Hat Logan?"
[3:57:43] <dalmek> Foghorn Logan
[3:57:44] <deeriojim> oh yeah the chest is still here
[3:57:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair
[3:57:54] <available_line> @Equirah I hope it will be good.
[3:57:54] <ghilbor> Logan's like a millena old anyway
[3:57:56] <peachy996> Hat no longer big, now old
[3:57:56] <fat_burtreynolds> Big hay Logan
[3:58:00] <+cdrom321> Someone took scissors to his hat, so it's no longer big.
[3:58:02] <oak120> we gonna clear the whole zone again, then homeward bone again. yall ready?
[3:58:04] <%Prevot> Naked Hat Logan
[3:58:08] <%patriotrenegade> which isnt this way
[3:58:08] <+Shishi1205> bro why play ds2 when you can mod ds3 to have more build viability than it
[3:58:10] <deeriojim> Big Hat Leeroy
[3:58:14] <foghornleghorn55> Irithyll > Anor Londo
[3:58:15] <Raldavar> welcome to the gank forest where the fun never ends
[3:58:19] <sothatsprettybrutal> punished "venom" hat logan
[3:58:19] <oda_flobunaga> Look, we all know that The Surge is the absolute pinnacle of the Soulslike genre
[3:58:20] <anthropomorphictempest> Maybe Logan's Hat turned him crazy?
[3:58:20] <%SaintBeau> @foghornleghorn55 take it back right now
[3:58:26] <Cryomancer_Maurice> @Shishi1205 Why do you need to mod DS3 xD
[3:58:26] <urkleturtle> nope, ain't here
[3:58:28] <%SaintBeau> wrong way reggie
[3:58:28] <+Shishi1205> horsefuck valley was enough once
[3:58:31] <%MajorCrasher> use the elevator plz Reggie
[3:58:32] <Dopamien> @Shishi1205 in general or pvp?
[3:58:33] <DSD24> @oda_flobunaga Surge 2 was better then Surge 1 at least
[3:58:33] <youngking_kush> I thought he had the shortcut??
[3:58:35] <Cryomancer_Maurice> That logic is the problem.
[3:58:37] <+Shishi1205> @Cryomancer_Maurice the gameplay good
[3:58:38] <%MooseIsGoose> Wrong way taking long way
[3:58:38] <Treasure_Vault> Why is woolie making reggie take the long route?
[3:58:39] <+Zxander93> Already forgot about the shotrcut
[3:58:39] <%Javaa01> The elevator is in area 1
[3:58:39] <%SaintBeau> @youngking_kush he does LUL
[3:58:40] <%Javaa01> Not 2
[3:58:41] <anthropomorphictempest> @foghornleghorn55 He's right you know
[3:58:46] <Treasure_Vault> I don't understand
[3:58:47] <Cryomancer_Maurice> DS2 is very good as well
[3:58:49] <stormhawk9891> Already passed it
[3:58:50] <oneimportantthing> Lol i did struggle to find the shortcut too
[3:58:51] <subjectg> @oda_flobunaga absolutely not, Slashy Souls is the peak of the soulsborne series, everything else is shit
[3:58:51] <+Shishi1205> @Dopamien depends on mods
[3:58:54] <peachy996> You don't need to mod ds3 but you can do the craziest stuff with it
[3:58:55] <%vivaciouseff> @youngking_kush he does, woolie is just misguiding him
[3:58:56] <$nodnerbuil> hope ya'll like jogging!
[3:59:01] <andre11dr> @foghornleghorn55 Bruh i appreciate the Irathil love but Grand Archive is the worst part of DS3
[3:59:01] <Treasure_Vault> The elevator is STRAIGHT ahead from the first bridge. Where y
[3:59:06] <Treasure_Vault> y'all going?
[3:59:11] <prime_name> DS2 has stupid levels of agro range
[3:59:14] <oak120> the longest possible path, lets go
[3:59:15] <+Baldzinga> Yeah the shortcut is in area 1
[3:59:16] <%SaintBeau> DS3 is the most overrated. it derives most of it's character from REMEMBER DS1?
[3:59:18] <%patriotrenegade> where the fuck are you going
[3:59:21] <klooswep> That stone knight has to catch up to you so he can give you his opinion on which soulsborne game is the best one
[3:59:25] <blackskulldragon18> He Jogging
[3:59:27] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr bro the swamp is right there
[3:59:30] <KyberNasse> Scenery route
[3:59:30] <%SaintBeau> DS2 tried to do it's own thing, which i respect
[3:59:31] <Johannen> Woolie has a history of poor navigation skills in this forest
[3:59:31] <+TDotGoat> It Follows
[3:59:32] <EonEzra> elevator long gone LUL
[3:59:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @klooswep oh no
[3:59:33] <deeriojim> he is going to the first elevator he took the bone out might've turned him around a bit
[3:59:39] <KayleNikita> retracing ALL the steps LUL
[3:59:41] <BigYanno> DS3 is fun. Cinders is great.
[3:59:42] <+Bitscreed> Here come that man
[3:59:44] <anthropomorphictempest> use the bone
[3:59:45] <+セビー> farron keep in sotfs is bonkers with its aggro
[3:59:49] <+SilverDevilfish> "I like Sekiro the most" - Stone Knight
[3:59:53] <oneimportantthing> Nothing beats discovering Drangleic Castle for the first time
[3:59:54] <youngking_kush> Yeah, just hug the right wall from the entrance
[3:59:56] <+セビー> er wait.. whatever the fire place was
[4:00:03] <%SaintBeau> Sekiro has the best gameplay
[4:00:03] <Treasure_Vault> they find difficulty in interesting places.
[4:00:10] <sirrice77> @SaintBeau Personally the most common opinion of DS3 is see is that it's overrated and not as good as DS1. But that's my experience
[4:00:11] <Raldavar> plot twist the giant golem beats him to the boss door first
[4:00:11] <tolloponik> might as well run the regular way
[4:00:12] <%SaintBeau> Sekiro is just so satisfying
[4:00:12] <peachy996> DS1 has the better foundation and overall level design. DS3 has good level design and better gameplay. DS2 has a great Majula theme
[4:00:14] <+Shishi1205> iron keep?
[4:00:15] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:00:17] <oak120> the boys comin in
[4:00:19] <DSD24> Nah man you need a haircut that's why I have these scissors
[4:00:21] <peachy996> But BB is still my favorite among all others
[4:00:21] <+セビー> yeah iron keep, thanks

[4:00:29] <+Shishi1205> yeah majula music OD
[4:00:29] <Cryomancer_Maurice> @SaintBeau Thats one of my biggest problems of DS3. NOSTALGIA. It hits so hard on Ds1 "please forget Ds2" and thrusts it at you so much its nauseating
[4:00:31] <andre11dr> I don't even count Sekiro, it's not even an RPG ,it's an stealth action game
[4:00:33] <youngking_kush> I just dont like how pretentious DS2 is
[4:00:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Reggie you stepped on his flowers
[4:00:42] <%Lion_kun> Why did Reggie take the long way
[4:00:42] <ghilbor> This uber's pretty fast tbh
[4:00:44] <%townzzzzz> IT'S TIME
[4:00:47] <Cryomancer_Maurice> How does a video game become pretentious xD
[4:00:48] <oneimportantthing> I hate that you can't grind in Sekiro lmao
[4:00:48] <youngking_kush> "Ooohhh you'll lose your souls!!!"
[4:00:48] <%Lion_kun> he had a shortcut
[4:00:49] <oda_flobunaga> Sekiro has no builds
[4:00:50] <%townzzzzz> FUCK
[4:00:52] <lord_of_the_dragons> damn woolie rich taking uberx

[4:01:12] <KyberNasse> EarthDay EarthDay
[4:01:12] <oak120> woof woof
[4:01:13] <%Vigonept> can we all agree shadow tower abyss was the best dark souls
[4:01:14] <nxflre> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ :D
[4:01:14] <+Bitscreed> Y'all are too impatient, lol
[4:01:16] <iamtheTwitchghost> kalameet sucks tho
[4:01:20] <anthropomorphictempest> He's in for it now
[4:01:23] <tolloponik> ready for dragon cum dogs
[4:01:24] <andre11dr> My balls are literally galaxies right now
[4:01:26] <Johannen> That's the second time Woolie guides Reggie the long way around this forest LUL
[4:01:27] <DSD24> @Vigonept I want to play that game
[4:01:29] <+Shishi1205> Kalameet has a rad design. Thats it
[4:01:30] <%Juriasu> snuff em
[4:01:30] <iamtheTwitchghost> oh wait he cant kill kalameet yet
[4:01:31] <deeriojim> double kill
[4:01:31] <velgaduere> nice double
[4:01:32] <+LegacyOfTheSith> i have the unpopular opinion that ds2 was better then 3 for me for the sole reason it is way more open and you can pick your own path
[4:01:36] <fat_burtreynolds> 40k Souls cause I took a Uber during the Serge? F that
[4:01:38] <@Solidus_113> if he activates kalameet I'm not gonna count it for a bet, it's actually too free and not real
[4:01:40] <lord_of_the_dragons> @DSD24 it's just an upgraded ride but costs more
[4:01:43] <%justcallmebobplease> LOOK AT THE WOOFERS
[4:01:43] <Equirah> they wanted to sniff your butt
[4:01:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's ok chat, he's just gonna get kalameet w/ the speedrun
[4:01:46] <Dementdrenegade> You can kill kalameet in the air, its just a fuckin slog
[4:01:47] <%justcallmebobplease> THEY BE SCALEY
[4:01:47] <%SaintBeau> i wonder if he's gonna wander innto Kalameet lmao
[4:01:49] <waltzqueen> @LegacyOfTheSith also less pandering
[4:01:51] <oneimportantthing> If anyone even bumps into me my blue balls will unload at this point
[4:01:52] <deeriojim> pup snuffer
[4:01:52] <DSD24> @lord_of_the_dragons Oh ok thanks for clarifying
[4:01:56] <+Shishi1205> For the only decent dragon fight to be on the last dark souls content...
[4:01:57] <deeriojim> right here
[4:02:01] <+Shishi1205> Elden ring better deliver
[4:02:02] <%patriotrenegade> down, boy
[4:02:04] <Equirah> @mods will the bet still count if he goes "the other way"?
[4:02:05] <Johannen> @Solidus_113 That would not count cause it aint artorias
[4:02:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Solidus_113 even as someone who said nay, ty

[4:02:19] <%jamsbybetty> I usually skip Kalameet, I kinda hate his fight :\
[4:02:20] <oda_flobunaga> @waltzqueen why does a giant spider have Seeth's soul?

[4:03:25] <andre11dr> This shouldn't count, it's just to free

[4:05:21] <oneimportantthing> Woolie it's not backseating to tell him there's a shortcut lol
[4:05:25] <youngking_kush> Just hug the right wall bro
[4:05:26] <binocu__lars> reggie i want this for you
[4:05:27] <+セビー> i liked midir enough to take him down in a few NG+s
[4:05:27] <%MooseIsGoose> maybe next time
[4:05:28] <ghilbor> His firebreat is actually Magic and Physical
[4:05:38] <JdotSweapA> this is the longest run from a bf to a boss  in the game iirc
[4:05:38] <Treasure_Vault> ??????
[4:05:41] <+Shishi1205> Look at Reggie's eyes
[4:05:42] <%BignanasTheGawd> Guys don’t worry, he’ll def use the shortcut when fighting boss
[4:05:42] <%MooseIsGoose> @ghilbor never knew that
[4:05:50] <+Shishi1205> He's lobing exploring the area
[4:05:53] <+セビー> midir is a better fight than sinh, which is a better kalameet imo
[4:05:54] <%Rafoki> because he boned he never saw where it connected
[4:05:54] <+Jiggisnipe> let him enjoy the scenery and be lost
[4:05:56] <Treasure_Vault> there is no second shortcut. There is a shortcut. stop skipping the shortcut.
[4:05:58] <youngking_kush> Good eyes
[4:05:59] <+セビー> ..and ancient doesnt count as a fight
[4:06:04] <oneimportantthing> Love Reggie's random jumps
[4:06:07] <+SilverDevilfish> limesBlink
[4:06:07] <+Baldzinga> Reggie and Zoro, getting lost together
[4:06:10] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah ancient dragonfire isn't the same kind of fire that gods and humans can harness
[4:06:11] <+Shishi1205> @セビー neither ancient wyvern
[4:06:14] <tolloponik> it's too late now
[4:06:15] <binocu__lars> sinh def the coolest lore
[4:06:18] <+tomdwarf> reggie doesnt know where it is, so he isnt gonna use it.
[4:06:20] <%SaintBeau> Midir>Sinh>Kalameet. love them all tho
[4:06:21] <oak120> @oneimportantthing wasnt really random, he was crossing a pit
[4:06:22] <binocu__lars> with the spear and stuff
[4:06:33] <andre11dr> The first time i fought Midir it was in NG5 and that took like 5 billion years
[4:06:33] <%jinking79> when a boxer lose to a youtuber even his mom has to clown on him it's over
[4:06:35] <subjectg> Yorgh’s spear was awesome
[4:06:37] <Treasure_Vault> It's literally straight ahead from the bonfire bridge.
[4:06:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @セビー why would it not count
[4:06:43] <+MightyDuckShoes> Philokolo is best dragon
[4:06:47] <oneimportantthing> Sekiro be like "you have one build, fucker"
[4:06:48] <KayleNikita> just aggro everything LUL
[4:06:54] <+Baldzinga> At least Reggie didn't get hit
[4:06:58] <binocu__lars> i think we can all agree the best dragon fight is the ancient wyvern
[4:06:58] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:06:59] <youngking_kush> EVERYONE, TO ME

[4:07:25] <OblivionSword1> chat chill
[4:07:25] <andre11dr> Midir would be the best dragon fight if he didn't have such a ridiculous amount of health
[4:07:25] <%Vigonept> reggie please it hurts

[4:22:02] <+セビー> even casters have to learn to dodge
[4:22:02] <Dabrikishaw> And I'm done betting for today.
[4:22:03] <BurdRightsActivist> BRAVER more like LAMER than stinger
[4:22:03] <iamtheTwitchghost> corrupted main character :(
[4:22:04] <JdotSweapA> STINGER
[4:22:10] <SixthShinx> Artorias out here acting like a DMC character
[4:22:10] <+terry_quest> worth it though
[4:22:11] <Dabrikishaw> 26000 is good enough for me
[4:22:12] <Tracazoid> Imagine if he could two hand, he'd probably just split Reggie like a mountain
[4:22:12] <%patriotrenegade> All this without his shield and his dog and with a broken arm
[4:22:12] <glass_marcus> He's the Headliner
[4:22:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> okay I bet the house and the kids on this Reggie DONT FUCK ME
[4:22:15] <Equirah> Actual cover boy

[4:22:19] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus originally not DLC, but the zone wasn't complete for launch so it had to be taken out
[4:22:20] <%hax_metatron> REGGIE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THE LEFT HAND. THE LEFT HAND!
[4:22:21] <binocu__lars> it's pay per view
[4:22:21] <ghilbor> artorias' off arm is his jackoff arm
[4:22:24] <@Menitta> is the dlc generally considered the best part of the game
[4:22:26] <yficaptions> pay for it AND THEN FIND IT
[4:22:26] <%BignanasTheGawd> This dlc is just several reality checks for reg
[4:22:28] <Dotados> The same with BB
[4:22:28] <dundore77> i mean doesnt this confirm he's not and that you actually are?
[4:22:29] <andre11dr> Yo ,we believe
[4:22:32] <urkleturtle> that's all fromsoft dlcs
[4:22:34] <Dabrikishaw> @Menitta Yes

[4:39:22] <%cubbywolf> what was I doing voting against artorias

[4:39:38] <youngking_kush> He punishes all those pauses
[4:39:38] <BlueEagle2395> Reggie should also check his rings

[4:40:45] <BlackermanZX> lets go reggarth
[4:40:47] <MinersLoveGames> LUL
[4:40:47] <+Shishi1205> I recommend Power within + 2H R2
[4:40:54] <fat_burtreynolds> He has r2 as well w/ mlgs
[4:40:55] <primaryfire> I mean strategically the best move would be fighting his easy phase with the sword and then bursting the hard phase
[4:40:58] <+theoldone001> He's gonna really struggle with Manus if he keeps on relying on magic mostly. Manus has insane rushdowns.
[4:41:00] <dundore77> can't he use the homing missles outside the door?
[4:41:02] <%cubbywolf> stingered
[4:41:13] <+extradopeness> issa stinger
[4:41:13] <%cubbywolf> LUL it cracks me up just standing there healing
[4:41:17] <andre11dr> LET'S GO REGGIE, don't look at why i voted tho LUL

[4:41:56] <youngking_kush> He knows when you are healing
[4:41:57] <%BaronVonHan> Bopped
[4:41:58] <+Rafraud> he just needed a warm up game now we're in there
[4:41:59] <BernieSandworm> this is how artorias is supposed to be tbh
[4:41:59] <+Shishi1205> power within first then unload crystal then R2 his add
[4:42:00] <%Lion_kun> I've one shot artorias with a BKS
[4:42:02] <oneimportantthing> Reggie is hollowing lmao
[4:42:02] <@Solidus_113> double digits let's go
[4:42:03] <+chase959> keep it in the off hand artorias
[4:42:04] <andre11dr> Yeah why isn't he kidleing?
[4:42:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> alright, 10 tries, it is now fair
[4:42:04] <$eco419> :)
[4:42:04] <%Lion_kun> felt great
[4:42:06] <%MooseIsGoose> wolf stronger then boar
[4:42:06] <youngking_kush> He knows when you're afraid
[4:42:10] <+swesterly> Magic failure facing the wrong way LMAO
[4:42:10] <Johannen> @Shadic790 Cause Sakurai is a coward
[4:42:14] <%cubbywolf> I've earned so many points voting no and lost all my points voting yes
[4:42:14] <%SaintBeau> wolves eat boars
[4:42:15] <ArvidOnFire> His roll is visibly mid
[4:42:16] <derap41> He has one
[4:42:16] <%JetpackMcQuack> he just needs iframes
[4:42:21] <+Thrasher08> always vote yea
[4:42:23] <+eanscrale> well if he was really another player, he'd backstab you
[4:42:26] <+king_of_mystery2> Woolie successfully shit talked reggie out of his confidence
[4:42:26] <JdotSweapA> i love how everyones going all in on Artorias now
[4:42:27] <foghornleghorn55> Woolie was 11 tries I think
[4:42:29] <+セビー> @cubbywolf same
[4:42:30] <SikSikSikki> All in on don't stop believin'
[4:42:33] <+theoldone001> When you control him through mods he feels like a fighting game character.
[4:42:36] <%Axle13j> YOU CAN DO THIS REGGIE KEEP COOL
[4:42:40] <+TopTieramisu> a certain orphan doesn't believe in stamina
[4:42:41] <%SaintBeau> believers in for a big pay out
[4:42:42] <peachy996> You're respecting him. Which makes you worse. Treat him like a bitch.
[4:42:46] <subjectg> Woolie is 14 tries, can reggie beat his record?
[4:42:47] <%cubbywolf> dont stop believing! HOLD ON TO THAT ARTORIASSSSSSSSSS
[4:42:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> i bet people lost hella points in these bets LUL
[4:42:50] <youngking_kush> And he doesnt give af lol
[4:42:51] <%justcallmebobplease> He's no-shield off-handing Reggie, with all his cheese - ARTORIAS FOREVER
[4:42:51] <oneimportantthing> Reggie isn't learning because he keeps using magic
[4:42:52] <%bruuzer12> same reason why Gascoigne was sooo good
[4:42:52] <+theoldone001> Also worth noting that Sif fights exactly like Artorias.
[4:42:59] <+extradopeness> hes a bitch through and through
[4:43:04] <waltzqueen> DONT STOP BELIEVIN
[4:43:08] <deeriojim> I think most people enjoy getting their asses kicked by Artorias, I know I do
[4:43:09] <%SaintBeau> yeah Sif uses Artorias' moveset
[4:43:14] <derap41> Been watching another streamer play this she's been for real replaying this fight just to duel him for hours
[4:43:20] <%cubbywolf> bonk
[4:43:20] <+TopTieramisu> i mean, technically artorias fights like sif
[4:43:26] <%funya_rinpa> He's not respecting him at all lol
[4:43:27] <%cubbywolf> wet bonk
[4:43:28] <zashrin777> back up
[4:43:29] <oneimportantthing> You can see why Sif is Artorias' doggo
[4:43:29] <oak120> like a book
[4:43:29] <%Axle13j> Pocket abyss too strong
[4:43:29] <subjectg> @arvidonfire that’s a fast roll babe, mid roll looks way different

[4:49:08] <QueequegTheater> Copium
[4:49:10] <+theoldone001> He's using his spears when Artorias is buffing, he takes less damage then
[4:49:11] <BlueEagle2395> Don't listen to Woolie, Reggie just get the W dude you dabess
[4:49:11] <Dio_TR> Infinite point glitch if you vote nah on the poll y’all
[4:49:13] <Qu1ckyyy> I think Woolie did more damage to Reggie than Artorias
[4:49:14] <%Deasmeister> @andre11dr it goes away if you do that
[4:49:17] <+Shadic790> Thank goodness they put dark bead after this fight
[4:49:18] <SarcFa> @Deasmeister exactly, Reggie keeps being aggressive with casting instead of reactive
[4:49:18] <%cubbywolf> 'in the bag' idk reggie is getting worse
[4:49:18] <+セビー> switching up playstyle after this many attempts would be negative progress

[4:49:29] <%WutangchickeN> Woolz tell Reggie about the elevator tech so he doesn't have to wait on every runback

[4:51:37] <%BaronVonHan> so close
[4:51:40] <+theoldone001> Bitch slapped your ass with Abyss sludge before killing you too
[4:51:40] <blackskulldragon18> Close
[4:51:42] <%Bread_Assassin> Sip or die mentality cost him that fight.
[4:51:44] <+pectusumbra> dark moon crown could also help
[4:51:45] <fat_burtreynolds> 90% of the way there reggie
[4:51:46] <ChoculaUltra> this is the one
[4:51:49] <%BignanasTheGawd> Didn’t know that +5 sword was for looks
[4:51:49] <deeriojim> kindle
[4:51:50] <oneimportantthing> REGGIE JUST KINDLE
[4:51:50] <Wahrow> Reggie finally experiencing Dark Souls the intended way
[4:51:51] <Reveresao> Reggie can wear the Crown of Dusk for extra Magic DMG
[4:51:51] <%Deasmeister> Dusk hat?
[4:51:54] <%Cozy90> FAP ring time?
[4:51:54] <binocu__lars> lucky 13
[4:51:55] <%Juriasu> a shield can block attack!
[4:51:56] <%cubbywolf> tap into the Ultra Instinct
[4:51:56] <+swesterly> Do it right 👏
[4:51:57] <+ArtemisCroc> put on the dusk crown bro
[4:51:58] <catasteroid0> Reggie might need to be reminded his sword can shoot laser beams
[4:52:00] <+mechslayer71> this is punishment for reggies many magic based sins
[4:52:01] <%cubbywolf> SKILL CHECK
[4:52:05] <velgaduere> YES, IT IS
[4:52:07] <zashrin777> Consider kindling perhaps?
[4:52:08] <+POUND_CAKE94> Naaahgghh
[4:52:08] <@Menitta> lucky 13
[4:52:10] <BlueEagle2395> nah he can do it, its close
[4:52:10] <%cubbywolf> nah, reggie is cheap af
[4:52:11] <+steelmorrigan> Back to basics
[4:52:11] <+Shishi1205> R2 reggie
[4:52:12] <oneimportantthing> Reggarth has been coasting up until this point lol
[4:52:12] <%BaronVonHan> This is the one!
[4:52:14] <%Javaa01> Yeah Reggie has the Meta -Crown, so like, he's just gotta do it for real
[4:52:16] <%cubbywolf> until the end
[4:52:16] <+SilverDevilfish> Boar is dead, Pretty Princess Crown time
[4:52:17] <derap41> "chugg or die" has not become "chugg and die"
[4:52:17] <leomuratore> Sip or die panic is making him lose control of the fight
[4:52:17] <+Shishi1205> just use that
[4:52:19] <jorniev> HE FUCKING KICKED YOUR CHEST
[4:52:19] <agustorm123> Nah coward
[4:52:20] <%Axle13j> He's playing it right
[4:52:20] <TheProtomanBlues> this feels like a good one but betting low just in case lol
[4:52:24] <emptyantics> WEAR THE CROWN
[4:52:24] <dundore77> i think power within and if he times the crystal spears right itll be done
[4:52:25] <%cubbywolf> reggie has to dodge the stinger
[4:52:27] <%SaintBeau> he has't really needed the kindle, he just needs to tighten up the second half of the fight
[4:52:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> Use the R2s
[4:52:30] <xdeathknightx> Just like the main character should've died many times but manages to eek out a win right at the end
[4:52:32] <+Shishi1205> That's the good point of your sword. use it
[4:52:32] <Hozak> Attacking while he's buffing is wasting magic
[4:52:33] <+セビー> now that im out of points woolz coaches
[4:52:34] <@Menitta> last time I bet Nah he won so LETS SEE
[4:52:34] <%Lion_kun> Honestly you should power within it
[4:52:37] <+extradopeness> the KICK was godlike
[4:52:37] <%Lion_kun> it does insane damage
[4:52:40] <agustorm123> Cowards dont deserve wins
[4:52:45] <+Jiggisnipe> sip or die doesn't work when Art's attacks kill below full hp
[4:52:48] <primaryfire> this isn't even the hard one so I'm excited
[4:52:48] <%SaintBeau> Artorias is like Mirio fighting Overhaul Quirkless
[4:52:52] <iamtheTwitchghost> @Hozak he's canceling the buff tho
[4:52:53] <SarcFa> @Hozak He has staggered Arty out of the buff twice with casting
[4:52:54] <notcumf> damn
[4:52:55] <Micnd90> you can block the first hit of his stinger then roll away
[4:52:56] <+Shishi1205> Reggie please use R2
[4:52:59] <KyberNasse> Put Artorias in DNF Duel, I dont give a fuck
[4:53:08] <%cubbywolf> prepared for failure
[4:53:08] <Dragon_Batman> That took me a large amount of tries on my first run
[4:53:10] <+Shishi1205> just once so you can see it Vs him
[4:53:14] <Dragon_Batman> @KyberNasse YES
[4:53:21] <+セビー> also, odds of chain guy blindsiding reggie?
[4:53:22] <Giztech> badass way to beat him is use the katana in both hands
[4:53:25] <@Menitta> damn odds are even
[4:53:30] <klooswep> Reggie has been getting better at dodging each time, he's got this
[4:53:33] <subjectg> Once again, staggering him out of his buff is coward shit
[4:53:34] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S !
[4:53:39] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S ! !
[4:53:42] <%SaintBeau> Artorias vs Alonne, who would win
[4:53:47] <subjectg> Let him buff for the boss fight he deserves
[4:53:51] <%cubbywolf> YEYE
[4:53:52] <KaiserMario> @A_German_spy Hey Spy, do you know how Artorias sword has mostly even stats? Do you think that suggests that Artorias may have started his journey as a Deprived?
[4:53:52] <andre11dr> Damn ,the odds are 50/50
[4:53:53] <DSD24> Get this Abyss off of me
[4:53:58] <%justcallmebobplease> @セビー Depends.  If Reggie tries to magic the problem away he'll probably one and done it.  But if he tries to fight... he doesn't get the 2-hand-to-not-stagger thing.
[4:53:58] <KeiganOfAstora> nope
[4:54:00] <%cubbywolf> dodged
[4:54:03] <+Lordgale119> @SaintBeau does Artorias have both hands?
[4:54:07] <%hax_metatron> That’s because of his buffs, which stack more defense poise and attack for him. He is truly getting stronger as he dies.
[4:54:08] <AbnormalVoid> go artie
[4:54:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> goddamit reggie stop casting randomly
[4:54:12] <Dragon_Batman> That poise is helping out at least
[4:54:15] <%cubbywolf> his right hand is hanging so i think his shoulder is dislocated
[4:54:20] <velgaduere> YEYEYE THE ROLLS
[4:54:23] <+Sir_Louis> hes getting it!
[4:54:23] <KeiganOfAstora> Let him do what he wants lawlz

[4:54:33] <Charlie99993> @cubbywolf It's dissolving into black goop
[4:54:34] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario Artorias isn't human. He's the same race as the gods of Anor Londo.
[4:54:36] <%Juriasu> THAT MOVE IS SO COOL
[4:54:38] <sothatsprettybrutal> and waiting for when to heal
[4:54:38] <DSD24> Yooo the back slash
[4:54:38] <%SaintBeau> @SaintBeau fair
[4:54:39] <KeiganOfAstora> That was a cheap one
[4:54:42] <%cubbywolf> ah he's gooping up
[4:54:44] <subjectg> that jump slash is extremely dangerous
[4:54:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Alonne wasn't really that hard
[4:54:52] <%justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy Does that race have a name?
[4:54:55] <%cubbywolf> that dodge LUL

[4:54:56] <@Menitta> WOW
[4:54:57] <deeriojim> ooh the dodge
[4:54:58] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario If anything, you could interpret the stat requirements on his sword as indicating that the gods are evenly-balanced and good at everything.
[4:54:58] <agustorm123> Dodge
[4:54:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> YOOO
[4:54:59] <KeiganOfAstora> Alonne's AI was more telegraphed

[4:56:17] <jorniev> DOES unequipping the shield to equip the casting staff take away the stamina buff?
[4:56:20] <+Shadic790> Nah screw those people. OP magic is tight
[4:56:21] <resloxxx> Imagine doing this on NG+
[4:56:21] <%cubbywolf> USE A SWORD LIKE A MAN
[4:56:21] <Jeexx> lacSip it feels better when you admit it
[4:56:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> elden ring magic looks tight
[4:56:23] <+セビー> reggie deleted my points
[4:56:23] <deeriojim> I am just happy you get to spend time with the best boss in DS1
[4:56:24] <%cubbywolf> OR WOMAN
[4:56:25] <%Prevot> you can wreck artorias with magic so easy LUL
[4:56:25] <+Aldra_E> Its Woolie LUL
[4:56:25] <+swesterly> Yup that’s me
[4:56:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> he just needs to cast magic as if he were swinging
[4:56:27] <%Deasmeister> Also hes only using 5 estus I barely scraped by with twenty
[4:56:29] <derap41> He learned it for YOU Woolie he learned it by watching YOU
[4:56:30] <%vVAstrAVv> were sorry magic is above you cavemen lol
[4:56:32] <subjectg> Reggie is almost matching Woolie’s tries here
[4:56:33] <andre11dr> Nah i love Hexes so i can't wait
[4:56:33] <BurdRightsActivist> lmao
[4:56:35] <+ArtemisCroc> magic is just as valid as melee
[4:56:37] <%superc37> @jorniev yes absolutely
[4:56:39] <Dragon_Batman> Yea I did that before the boss souls too, that shit is tough
[4:56:39] <%cubbywolf> you can do that?
[4:56:40] <%A_German_spy> @KaiserMario Elizabeth confirms it when she says "such a hero has nary a murmur of Dark." The Dark Soul is intrinsically something that only humans have. The fact that Artorias has none of it means he's not human, and the only other race he could be is a god.
[4:56:41] <+eanscrale> well first of all, if you wanna zone all that armor is doing you no good
[4:56:43] <+Shishi1205> you cant
[4:56:46] <fat_burtreynolds> Plenty have had their balls exposed on live stream too reggie. Just ask Pat
[4:56:46] <emptyantics> LUL LUL LUL
[4:56:46] <leomuratore> Oof
[4:56:48] <velgaduere> like 30 levels ago
[4:56:48] <%Lion_kun> This is the boss that has given Reggie most trouble so far
[4:56:49] <Reveresao> Pushing your shit in
[4:56:49] <%BaronVonHan> All those magic kink shamers
[4:56:49] <Charlie99993> @jorniev For grass crest? Yes, needs to be wielded, even if it's on the back
[4:56:50] <jett_eyes> You can break Artorias out of his charge up thingy
[4:56:54] <%cubbywolf> that you can do
[4:56:56] <SuperGoblinPunch> Magic is journalist mode
[4:56:57] <%cubbywolf> and also accidently
[4:56:57] <linSP> You have to get to dukes
[4:57:01] <jett_eyes> you just gotta hit him hard enough
[4:57:01] <QueequegTheater> Kappa
[4:57:02] <+Shishi1205> you need lordvessel
[4:57:05] <+theoldone001> Havel would be really happy his boy doing work.
[4:57:05] <TigerClaws12> you need Dukes
[4:57:05] <%thedankestmeeme> I did that shit
[4:57:05] <%Lion_kun> Woolie did it lol
[4:57:06] <subjectg> It is very possible
[4:57:07] <velgaduere> NOT impossible
[4:57:12] <Darren716> I mean lord vessel is right after O and S
[4:57:13] <%thedankestmeeme> It was hell on earth
[4:57:16] <@Solidus_113> all for a good cutscene
[4:57:16] <Dragon_Batman> He said after O & S
[4:57:19] <subjectg> just don’t get hit when he buffs
[4:57:20] <Darren716> So I get what Woolie means
[4:57:21] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah you can rush to O&S and then access DLC nearly instantly
[4:57:25] <Dragon_Batman> The rest is implied LUL
[4:57:25] <agustorm123> The anti magic dudes are right
[4:57:28] <linSP> y’all know what he means
[4:57:32] <DSD24> STINGER
[4:57:33] <%justcallmebobplease> It's very hard... UNLESS YOU HAVE A BALLER SHIELD
[4:57:35] <%Javaa01> With a Guitar Hero controller
[4:57:37] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> broken sword run is possible
[4:57:38] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease The Dark Soul is intrinsically something that only humans have. The fact that Artorias has none of it means he's not human, and the only other race he could be is a god.
[4:57:38] <+Jiggisnipe> it's possible but on someone's 1st playthrough
[4:57:38] <youngking_kush> It's not easy for sure
[4:57:39] <+セビー> ppl act like magic means casting from a corner when you still need to learn dodge timing on stuff like artorias or pursuer
[4:57:41] <%justcallmebobplease> With a good shield you can make Artorias a joke.
[4:57:42] <%MajorCrasher> O&S are really cool but they're literally nothing compared to this in terms of difficulty
[4:57:47] <%BaronVonHan> I still posit that 'Bert and Ernie' is are the best nicknames for O and S
[4:57:52] <jorniev> @jorniev so is he losing the stamina buff? to casst a spell?
[4:57:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:57:52] <+Shishi1205> pretty early
[4:57:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE
[4:57:53] <zashrin777> POOPED
[4:57:55] <Papa_Shu> did he ever kindle
[4:57:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> YEEEEEEAH
[4:57:56] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus One guy beat it using bongo drum controllers
[4:57:56] <+Shadic790> STYLING
[4:57:57] <urkleturtle> yeah artorias was the biggest roadblock in my sl1 run
[4:57:58] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:57:58] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah a greatshield completely disables this entire fight
[4:57:58] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you did do it early
[4:57:58] <linSP> Arty at SL 1 is fun tho
[4:57:59] <fat_burtreynolds> Ds1 on rock band drum set was pog
[4:57:59] <wragglee> JOHNS
[4:57:59] <SoaringTrumpet> LUL
[4:57:59] <+Jiggisnipe> he's button mashing
[4:57:59] <TigerClaws12> LMAO
[4:58:00] <xdeathknightx> launch and going for the juggle
[4:58:00] <youngking_kush> He also got wrecked too guys lol
[4:58:04] <%Pillagius> Woolie was a monster back in first playthrough
[4:58:04] <+king_of_mystery2> You basically did the thing you said, no lord souls, and then afterwards you steamrolled the rest of the game
[4:58:05] <TigerClaws12> HE'S A MASHER
[4:58:05] <+sewermonk> scrubquote lmao
[4:58:07] <DSD24> Breakdown!
[4:58:08] <%funya_rinpa> spitroasted
[4:58:09] <andre11dr> It's hard but people can beat him with bare hands so....
[4:58:10] <%SaintBeau> SHOT THROUGH THE HEART
[4:58:11] <subjectg> @woolieversus you fought him at like SL 70, after 4 kings
[4:58:13] <%Juriasu> the taunt at the end
[4:58:14] <BlackermanZX> a true melee player
[4:58:14] <%cubbywolf> buffed stinger is killing you every time reggie
[4:58:15] <agustorm123> Please use the sword at least
[4:58:15] <iamtheTwitchghost> HOLLOWING
[4:58:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie gettin sloppy with his sips
[4:58:17] <+PkSilent01> @WoolieVersus you did fought him early because you fought Sif after the DLC
[4:58:18] <Reveresao> LUL
[4:58:18] <Equirah> sip or die is absolutely killing reggie
[4:58:18] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease And there are several dialogue instances such as when Ciaran says, "Are you human? I forgive you." which make very clear that the gods are a distinct race from humans.
[4:58:19] <SuperGoblinPunch> Oh no he's spaming, pew pew pew
[4:58:19] <foghornleghorn55> light roll might help
[4:58:19] <oak120> 13 TIME CHAMPION
[4:58:20] <nmulepingu> kindle
[4:58:20] <%Pillagius> Woolie literally became ungovernable in the world of Dark Souls
[4:58:21] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Ouch
[4:58:23] <dundore77> im pretty sure you beat him before sif so you get the 1 second extra to the cutscene
[4:58:24] <Micnd90> get TOTSUKEGI'd by the abysswalker
[4:58:24] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:58:27] <Klarrann3> This is where the "sip or die" advice fails
[4:58:28] <sothatsprettybrutal> like how many times are you going to stand a foot in front of him and hit estus
[4:58:29] <Qu1ckyyy> Reggie is Unlearning
[4:58:29] <Dragon_Batman> I'm so happy Artorias hasn't disappointed
[4:58:29] <leomuratore> Stop healing in front of the enemies, Reggie! It's getting you killed
[4:58:30] <xdeathknightx> So happy Reggie is getting the REAL souls experience :D
[4:58:31] <%Pillagius> with his Silver Spear
[4:58:32] <fat_burtreynolds> Love those launchers
[4:58:33] <notcumf> 10 HIT COMBO
[4:58:33] <%BignanasTheGawd> Sip and die
[4:58:34] <%Bread_Assassin> Sip or die mentality is getting him killed.
[4:58:35] <Dragon_Batman> Love you Reggie
[4:58:35] <%cubbywolf> Bash your head against this wall reggie
[4:58:36] <Darren716> Welcome to the real man's world
[4:58:36] <@Solidus_113> another one
[4:58:37] <%justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy I imagine the answer is 'we have no result to judge off', but what happens if a God is just holding some Humanity?  Can they not pick it up?  Can they not pop it?
[4:58:37] <zashrin777> Every notch on his hilt bears your name
[4:58:37] <%Lion_kun> You did it early to get the sif cutscene
[4:58:43] <%SaintBeau> it's pretty hard to wander into the DLC lul
[4:58:45] <mikesapartment> god damn
[4:58:48] <Dragon_Batman> Oh cuz you cheated the ring
[4:58:49] <%cubbywolf> a little early but not really
[4:58:50] <+TopTieramisu> his body is full of tallies like killmonger
[4:58:51] <%xcompleasedad> I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH
[4:58:53] <%MajorCrasher> Manus is going to be a fucking RIDE
[4:58:54] <deeriojim> "Sip or Die" has been replaced by "Sip AND Die"
[4:58:56] <Sypheck> people didn't even know how to access the DLC after it was released LUL
[4:58:58] <+Fefe41> Was about to ask how many tries it's been and then I see the poll lol poor reggie
[4:58:59] <Reveresao> Whats reggie SL?
[4:58:59] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> @a_german_spy howdy! How have you been?
[4:59:02] <%Lion_kun> And you did it in 8 tries
[4:59:03] <subjectg> Because you wanted the Sif cutscene
[4:59:04] <youngking_kush> And got wrecked lol
[4:59:08] <SarcFa> Reggie sl 90+
[4:59:08] <+Shishi1205> 5
[4:59:08] <%Pillagius> Dat Silver Knight Spear tho...
[4:59:10] <%SaintBeau> @Reveresao 92
[4:59:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Fefe41 15 is nothing for this fight
[4:59:15] <BigYanno> I still think Artorias is easier than Manus
[4:59:15] <notcumf> sheeeesh
[4:59:16] <subjectg> you got wrecked and took 14 tries methinks
[4:59:18] <zashrin777> Damn, that was a long time ago
[4:59:20] <%CyberArtClub> "I've suffered, so you must as well"
[4:59:24] <agustorm123> @Reveresao he is massive
[4:59:27] <+extradopeness> damn it has been that long huh...
[4:59:28] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease We can only speculate on that, because there are no cases of it ever happening. All we know is that humans are descendants of the Pygmy, and the humanity they have within them is a fragment of the Dark Soul.
[4:59:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @fefe41 what you mean poor reggie? he's been steamrolling the 2nd half of the game
[4:59:29] <KyberNasse> Cmon Reggie he has downloaded you so many times, his SSD is getting full
[4:59:30] <TigerClaws12> teggie is 90+ with a god build
[4:59:32] <%A_German_spy> @Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1 Heya charly23Hi
[4:59:34] <%Lion_kun> Was it 14? i thought it was 8
[4:59:35] <%MajorCrasher> oh yeah Artorias is definitely easier
[4:59:36] <oneimportantthing> And Woolie used 20 estus AND humanity to heal
[4:59:36] <linSP> Do 4 kings straight out of undead asylum for that early red orb
[4:59:37] <Dragon_Batman> Yea thinking about that, it's been a really long time
[4:59:39] <andre11dr> Well, you do have to beat the Guardian to get here, so it's not that free
[4:59:45] <%Lion_kun> The other 2 bosses took him like 10 tries
[4:59:49] <youngking_kush> @oneimportantthing That's also ttue
[4:59:53] <$thotbane> Woolie did sequence breaking to get Kaathe and pet Sif in 1 playthrough
[4:59:59] <%Lion_kun> Oh yeah Reggie should kindle
[5:00:00] <+Fefe41> @Reverend_Roscoe True, that good luck is finally getting to him
[5:00:01] <fat_burtreynolds> Crazy that bb snail through was almost 7 years ago but still my favorite pat/Woolie LP
[5:00:03] <agustorm123> Woolie used everything
[5:00:04] <foghornleghorn55> is artorias the same race as gwyn?
[5:00:07] <%justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy I ask because I've been wondering the whole game series, if gods are not actually distinct, but just act like it/enough of them have enough souls to be BIG AND STRONG.
[5:00:13] <Dragon_Batman> Yea cuz that Sif stuff was kind of a must see at the time
[5:00:19] <leomuratore> Be patient and cold.
[5:00:23] <subjectg> @linsp what would you use for dps at that point anyway? killing ingward off the bat means you have to have very low dmg
[5:00:24] <%cubbywolf> if you run at him will he fly over you chat?

[5:00:34] <zashrin777> @fat_burtreynolds Its crazy how long we've been watching these bumblekings.
[5:00:38] <+セビー> Bb dlc playthru with the trio was a great time
[5:00:39] <+extradopeness> hes flexing reggie
[5:00:40] <oneimportantthing> Imagine if Pat was here now PixelBob
[5:00:41] <%CyberArtClub> Building his style meter
[5:00:45] <deeriojim> ah good he cancelled
[5:00:45] <lyzejag> SMOKING SEXY STYLE
[5:00:46] <%cubbywolf> shmooving and groovin
[5:00:46] <Charlie99993> He broke the install
[5:00:48] <%Pillagius> Oh gosh... Now Artorias just styling on Reggie...
[5:00:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @fefe41 it seems like he's losijg all the lessons he had to internalize when times were tougher
[5:00:51] <Charlie99993> Uh oh
[5:00:51] <+Shishi1205> Or like max likes to say flippin and dippin
[5:00:53] <+Jiggisnipe> with the tip
[5:00:53] <emptyantics> GODDAMN ARTORIAS IS SO COOL
[5:00:54] <$thotbane> @foghornleghorn55 yes they’re “gods” same as the silver/black knights and I’d assumechannelers
[5:00:55] <peachy996> he's doing his ungabunga
[5:00:55] <%justcallmebobplease> @oneimportantthing The shittalking would be legendary
[5:00:57] <+pizzadeliveryman> ruh roh
[5:00:59] <+TopTieramisu> marthorias
[5:01:00] <%cubbywolf> thats an AoE
[5:01:02] <+Jiggisnipe> he Marthed you
[5:01:08] <%Pillagius> Woolz, you can cancel the power up with a few nice melee hits.
[5:01:08] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease The overwhelming implication is that they're distinct, yeah.
[5:01:11] <KyberNasse> Frame data
[5:01:21] <subjectg> @cubbywolf the big jump tracks to where you were, so you can walk forward and not get hit
[5:01:28] <%funya_rinpa> let's go, one shot
[5:01:29] <deeriojim> dat swing over his head while Reggie was seated
[5:01:35] <%cubbywolf> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[5:01:35] <deeriojim> hitboxes
[5:01:36] <%funya_rinpa> gg
[5:01:37] <+Shishi1205> rip
[5:01:38] <Darren716> Ooof
[5:01:39] <$thotbane> @woolieversus tell Reggie he can go in and stagger him out of the powerup
[5:01:40] <iamtheTwitchghost> REKT
[5:01:40] <ChoculaUltra> it cuts so deep
[5:01:40] <%SaintBeau> ggs
[5:01:41] <waltzqueen> F
[5:01:42] <+pizzadeliveryman> ooof
[5:01:42] <agustorm123> Big downloaded
[5:01:42] <ChoculaUltra> so so deep
[5:01:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah baby
[5:01:43] <thefranchise00> take a brealk
[5:01:45] <+steelmorrigan> Sigh
[5:01:46] <emptyantics> F
[5:01:46] <yukichocomilk> my boy arty Kreygasm
[5:01:47] <%cubbywolf> LETS GET GOOD YOU F
[5:01:49] <youngking_kush> You gotta fight him
[5:01:49] <+Shishi1205> Power within time
[5:01:50] <andre11dr> So since we might never see it ,you can stop him from charging that AoE and buff
[5:01:51] <+disgruntledgruntle> Might as well drop unequip the shoeld
[5:01:52] <+steelmorrigan> he;'s being a goon
[5:01:54] <+disgruntledgruntle> Shield
[5:01:55] <BurdRightsActivist> Power within
[5:01:55] <%BaronVonHan> There was a Reggie here, he's gone now.
[5:01:56] <peachy996> Much like a certain enemy in BB he always knows when you want to heal
[5:01:57] <MinersLoveGames> MY POINT S
[5:01:57] <leomuratore> Sure cash out
[5:01:59] <+Shishi1205> magic too
[5:02:00] <+mechslayer71> this is what happens when you just delete things with magic. you barely know how to play the game
[5:02:01] <agustorm123> Regarth needs to be more agressive
[5:02:01] <xdeathknightx> Artorias got you for 5 minutes, 5 minutes of PLAY TIME
[5:02:03] <deeriojim> just gotta hit his stagger limit
[5:02:04] <TigerClaws12> he did stagger with 2 crystal arrow
[5:02:04] <+pizzadeliveryman> number 16
[5:02:05] <+Shishi1205> he has done it b4
[5:02:09] <Archmortal> reggie knocked him out of it with two crystal spears
[5:02:10] <+extradopeness> hollowing
[5:02:11] <oak120> 15 Time Champion!
[5:02:11] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie refuses to kindle out of pride
[5:02:12] <%cubbywolf> this is where you take a break if you aren't streaming LUL
[5:02:13] <dundore77> power within use the crystal spear and time them the one time you did that and hit with all 4 you got him to the health he was at when you just died
[5:02:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @andre11dr he has done that several times
[5:02:14] <pi_in_the_sci> He was knocking him out of install with soul arrows
[5:02:15] <%SaintBeau> maybe switch to a lighter armor
[5:02:16] <deeriojim> you can Headshot him with an arrow to cancel the powerup too
[5:02:17] <nmulepingu> is there a reason why he doesn't kindle that i don't know
[5:02:18] <iamtheTwitchghost> no one is betting yea lmao
[5:02:18] <subjectg> I think being able to stagger him out of it was a mistake
[5:02:19] <waltzqueen> I can't even gamble anymore. its too sad
[5:02:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> alright REGGIR YOU GOT THIS
[5:02:20] <%SaintBeau> the i-frames would help
[5:02:24] <fat_burtreynolds> Please kindle reggie cause this is going nowhere
[5:02:24] <+Fefe41> Not even a 10% return from that bet lol
[5:02:28] <Treasure_Vault> Reggie, you can kindle every remaining bonfire. I think you have enough.
[5:02:30] <%Cozy90> If you arent gonna block might as well grass crest
[5:02:32] <%xcompleasedad> He won’t win until a Kindle
[5:02:35] <deeriojim> @nmulepingu he forgot about it/pride
[5:02:45] <agustorm123> No kindle why not?
[5:02:47] <+セビー> yea voters.. welcome to broke souls
[5:02:53] <%Deasmeister> Swing is worse than homing crystal
[5:02:54] <+LeaIsChill> woolie just called this man FAKE
[5:02:54] <%SaintBeau> Artorias is balls out, there's no shame
[5:02:59] <+Shishi1205> R2 for whiff punish too @woolieversus
[5:03:01] <iamtheTwitchghost> does he have more spear spells?
[5:03:03] <%cubbywolf> getting reggie to swing will force him to change his approach to this boss and therefor reset his 'progress'
[5:03:09] <KyberNasse> Hollowing out here
[5:03:11] <%Juriasu> two-hand swings would be better that soulmass imo
[5:03:12] <Dragon_Batman> He probably just feels confident abd doesn't want to kindle like Stray
[5:03:14] <oneimportantthing> Reggie has some balls refusing to kindle
[5:03:19] <%cubbywolf> Reggie's humanity is low
[5:03:20] <%ozzrabbit> Please remind Reggie that his sword has an R2 laser blast
[5:03:22] <andre11dr> Reggie is really unconfident in his R2
[5:03:25] <leomuratore> His spells are ending too soon as well
[5:03:27] <oak120> wot
[5:03:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie if reggie doesn't spam his spears like crazy he can almost entirely kill him with spears
[5:03:29] <iamtheTwitchghost> @ozzrabbit THIS
[5:03:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie has learned the fight at all from swinging, when he swings he tries to fight him straight up
[5:03:32] <$thotbane> Why doesn’t he have crystal spear
[5:03:34] <+セビー> extra sips can calm nerves tho
[5:03:39] <agustorm123> Finally
[5:03:44] <agustorm123> use that sword
[5:03:44] <iamtheTwitchghost> @thotbane he does
[5:03:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Yeah Reggie!
[5:03:47] <%cubbywolf> DODGED
[5:03:48] <%SaintBeau> @thotbane he's saving casts for the second half
[5:03:53] <andre11dr> @thotbane He has two of them
[5:03:53] <+セビー> fighting with 1 sip is different than 6
[5:03:55] <JdotSweapA> Arty takes reduced dmg during phase shifts too
[5:04:01] <+TopTieramisu> now this is looking nice
[5:04:03] <+Breaknoon> nice dodges!
[5:04:07] <+extradopeness> look at this movement
[5:04:07] <%SaintBeau> GO REGGIE
[5:04:10] <TheProtomanBlues> This fight looking sick
[5:04:14] <iamtheTwitchghost> ooh that stamina dmg
[5:04:16] <%SaintBeau> shit
[5:04:17] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL LUL
[5:04:18] <ChungusQuest> man's got balls of pure crystal
[5:04:19] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[5:04:19] <Darren716> BURST
[5:04:21] <%cubbywolf> got the worst of both worlds LUL
[5:04:26] <+extradopeness> BOP
[5:04:29] <emptyantics> Use that BEAM SABER to hit him
[5:04:29] <+Shishi1205> spells not consuming stamina on ds1 is really bs huh
[5:04:33] <tolloponik> what estus
[5:04:33] <oneimportantthing> Bruh
[5:04:38] <%Axle13j> oof lol
[5:04:39] <iamtheTwitchghost> HIGH CRUSH
[5:04:41] <peachy996> your health bar was like "just kidding"
[5:04:42] <yukichocomilk> low profile PogChamp
[5:04:43] <%cubbywolf> LUL that sigh
[5:04:45] <agustorm123> Those hadokens are missing
[5:04:47] <deeriojim> Artorias also get iframes on his rolls
[5:04:47] <+TopTieramisu> spellswords have a tough life
[5:04:48] <%SaintBeau> FUUUCK
[5:04:51] <+kevlarkoala> @Shishi1205 you mispelled "fun as fuck" LUL
[5:04:51] <%funya_rinpa> that staff needs to be confiscated from reggie
[5:04:55] <%cubbywolf> Artorias THE GREAT!
[5:04:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:04:56] <fat_burtreynolds> Side roll those stingers dude
[5:04:57] <TheProtomanBlues> FUCK me money
[5:04:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Reggie dammit you were doing good
[5:04:58] <JdotSweapA> lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA lordji1SOIYA
[5:05:05] <oneimportantthing> Is there some kind of pride involved in not kindling? Lol
[5:05:06] <$thotbane> I just got here has Woolie mentioned Arty’s left handed and kicking your ass with his bum arm?
[5:05:09] <%SaintBeau> you got this reggarth <3
[5:05:10] <+Aldra_E> This is what happens when you use magic LUL
[5:05:12] <Puhff> yah baby gimme da points
[5:05:15] <iamtheTwitchghost> @thotbane yea
[5:05:15] <+Jiggisnipe> don't do anything greedy
[5:05:15] <KyberNasse> Magic is the firebomb of this run
[5:05:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> pay me!
[5:05:17] <SarcFa> @thotbane he mentioned it
[5:05:18] <xdeathknightx> Reggie that guy that relied on zoning only, found someone that punishes his zoning and now has to learn how to fight for real ;)
[5:05:20] <%cubbywolf> im so glad im here for this\
[5:05:20] <deeriojim> @thotbane yep
[5:05:21] <leomuratore> doodOne
[5:05:22] <+oz_suka> use soul spear during the buffs, Reggie
[5:05:22] <peachy996> the only magic you should use is CSS
[5:05:23] <+Jiggisnipe> you will be punished
[5:05:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie re-learing the asylum lesson
[5:05:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> you're gonna be such a cool mage
[5:05:28] <%Prevot> reggie should be holding that staff in his right hand
[5:05:30] <%justcallmebobplease> BE AGRESSIVE
[5:05:33] <%justcallmebobplease> B
[5:05:35] <%justcallmebobplease> E
[5:05:35] <Archmortal> soul spears work to knock him out of the buff charging
[5:05:35] <Charlie99993> From 2k to 10k BABY
[5:05:38] <%justcallmebobplease> AGRESSIVE
[5:05:40] <%cubbywolf> I think all the cheering we did for Artorias has really hurt reggie LUL
[5:05:43] <emptyantics> BE AGGRESSY
[5:05:43] <cs0402196> reggie learning that there's multiple types of greed
[5:05:44] <oneimportantthing> Bloodborne aggression works really well here
[5:05:44] <+POUND_CAKE94> psaBig
[5:05:49] <+mechslayer71> spend the game not playing the game, now he doesn't know how to play the game @aldra_e
[5:05:50] <%SaintBeau> BELIEVERS socpens2FAST BELIEVERS socpens2FAST BELIEVERS socpens2FAST
[5:05:51] <%justcallmebobplease> @cubbywolf ...GOOD.
[5:05:51] <+extradopeness> b e a g g r e s s i v e
[5:05:55] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:05:57] <BigYanno> You're currently being pre ghost scrooge, you gotta be post ghost scrooge
[5:06:02] <+Aldra_E> i HOPE Reggy never touches magic again if he plays other souls games, Woolie should have stopped him
[5:06:03] <%Demoli_PT> i cant believe he hasnt kindled yet
[5:06:10] <%SaintBeau> there was this girly at the tourney where it's kill or be killed
[5:06:10] <+swesterly> It’s safe to cheer for Reggie now that he has been denied the cheese
[5:06:13] <+セビー> swapping hands or opting for melee only would only mess up muscle memory at this point
[5:06:13] <%cubbywolf> Woolie give him the good advice of Get Gud
[5:06:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Aldra_E woolie's not pat
[5:06:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @cs0402196 has to learn that your turn isn't just attacking, it's healing or casting too
[5:06:17] <%Pillagius> I think at this point Reggie could do even better in Melee... He already has those openings down.
[5:06:22] <+セビー> just learn the timing and dont waste casts
[5:06:22] <andre11dr> Reggie getting farmed for points
[5:06:23] <%Rasheedt> @demoli_pt hes built different
[5:06:23] <%hax_metatron> When Artorias has one pixel of health and has stacked his buff > 5 times, he can one shot a full vigor SL 150 player on NG
[5:06:24] <oneimportantthing> In all fairness Reggie almost won unkindled a few times
[5:06:29] <Dragon_Batman> He got this, just needs to clean up that tech
[5:06:30] <iamtheTwitchghost> dark souls is a turn-based game
[5:06:33] <+mechslayer71> if Reggie keeps counting on magic in DS2, Bloodborne is gonna eat him alive
[5:06:39] <%cubbywolf> fashion souls is hard to beat
[5:06:40] <emptyantics> @hax_metatron Holy shit
[5:06:41] <%BaronVonHan> I'm goin' yea on this one
[5:06:44] <oak120> ducked it
[5:06:46] <blue_grave> doubters rise
[5:06:49] <+oz_suka> NOW
[5:06:49] <%cubbywolf> CONCENTRATE! USE THE FORCE JEDI
[5:06:51] <fat_burtreynolds> Woolie grabs by the hand “it’s time to Kindle CurseLit ”
[5:06:55] <TheProtomanBlues> @saintbeau Be aggressive, be-e aggressive
[5:06:56] <sothatsprettybrutal> 100% augur of ebrietas run
[5:06:58] <emptyantics> I BELIEVE
[5:06:59] <tolloponik> already?!
[5:06:59] <%justcallmebobplease> @mechslayer71 I kinda want Reggie to keep relying on it in DS2, specifically so he falls on his ass in BB
[5:07:01] <+extradopeness> lets go reggie
[5:07:05] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:07:09] <Darren716> Maybe reggie should try the dusk crown?
[5:07:16] <Darren716> Get that raw 20% more dam
[5:07:16] <SikSikSikki> So I want to draw Reggies character- but I don't know if I should draw him as he is now or if I should wait til the end in case his fashion changes drastically. What do you guys think?
[5:07:17] <%cubbywolf> well then
[5:07:18] <Aaronc123425> Put the OJ down, and fight me! -Artorioas
[5:07:18] <Dragon_Batman> Such a late swing
[5:07:19] <%Lion_kun> lock on
[5:07:19] <+セビー> DS2 will 100% tempt him with hexes
[5:07:19] <+Jiggisnipe> in the back
[5:07:20] <iamtheTwitchghost> DAMN
[5:07:21] <%BaronVonHan> I believe
[5:07:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> BGACKSTAB
[5:07:23] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S ! !
[5:07:25] <xdeathknightx> no running in these here parts
[5:07:26] <+Aldra_E> Damn, will he give up here? xD
[5:07:27] <youngking_kush> He should have a learning run
[5:07:27] <+oz_suka> Reggie turnig hollow
[5:07:30] <notcumf> thought that one was it
[5:07:30] <%theblackbreath> assasinated
[5:07:32] <derap41> Gotta unlearn Sip or die
[5:07:32] <%justcallmebobplease> THIS IS THE GUY
[5:07:32] <+Fefe41> I have 17 points left
[5:07:33] <+LeaIsChill> A cut on a swordsman's back is the greatest shame
[5:07:34] <blue_grave> he said "GET THE FUCK BACK HERE" lol
[5:07:35] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S !
[5:07:37] <resloxxx> that one was through the back of the head
[5:07:38] <%BaronVonHan> nvm
[5:07:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> This is the intended experience
[5:07:40] <youngking_kush> Like just go in and try to dodge his shit
[5:07:40] <%justcallmebobplease> There are no apologies for THE GUY clowning you
[5:07:40] <Charlie99993> 13K LET'S GO
[5:07:41] <%funya_rinpa> the greediest magic
[5:07:41] <TheProtomanBlues> Sticking to nah untill I'm financially stable again
[5:07:41] <deeriojim> damn reggie getting hit by the tip a lot
[5:07:42] <%Axle13j> Nothin to apologize for Reggie
[5:07:42] <zhenthrim213> im back to 1k now
[5:07:42] <NumbF4ke> power within would prob do tghe trick, as long as spears are timed right
[5:07:43] <%justcallmebobplease> He is THE GUY
[5:07:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie it's fine, this is maybe the 2nd or 3rd hardest fight
[5:07:43] <linSP> ARTOUR
[5:07:45] <Dragon_Batman> Never apologize, this is the normal experience
[5:07:45] <+Shishi1205> @woolieversus 2 crystal soul spears will stagger him out of his power up
[5:07:47] <%Deasmeister> Kindleing would help
[5:07:47] <+blastyoboots> my first glimpse of the live stream is Reggie dying to Artorias.  All is right with the world
[5:07:49] <waltzqueen> LETS GO REGGIE

[5:08:12] <xdeathknightx> it's what we wanted all along
[5:08:12] <+AkronymCLT> The journey is the draw
[5:08:13] <%strakillias> "I'm sorry you get to keep watching this RAD bossfight"  -- Reggie
[5:08:14] <wragglee> i promise we are having the best time we possibly could, it wouldve sucked if you won instantly

[5:08:21] <Dragon_Batman> Honestly I'm so happy you're not first trying it
[5:08:22] <%cubbywolf> Dont worry Reggie, I can only get so erect
[5:08:22] <+oz_suka> this boar was about to one shot Artorias
[5:08:23] <%Lion_kun> Reggie finally humbled by a boss after crusing through the game
[5:08:23] <nooowaayjose> you got this reggie. thanks for the points tho
[5:08:24] <youngking_kush> Fuckin Plus Ultra
[5:08:24] <xdeathknightx> Suffer like G did
[5:08:25] <+It_sjustjoey> zeroleSitpat
[5:08:27] <Micnd90> block and learn his moves dude
[5:08:28] <+blastyoboots> can't be overleveled for Artorias
[5:08:29] <AngryAsian5> IT'S ALL IN THE GAME \LUL
[5:08:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> I feel like there's gonna be a special episode of the anime that's just a death montage
[5:08:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is like the second hardest thing in the game
[5:08:31] <Darren716> Like this isn't a bed of chaos situation, we wanna see this fight
[5:08:32] <+セビー> DS has its walls, we’ve all been here
[5:08:33] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:08:33] <fat_burtreynolds> Slow and Insidious killer
[5:08:34] <deeriojim> No shame in kindling
[5:08:35] <agustorm123> Guile sound track required to win
[5:08:36] <TigerClaws12> yea if manus humbles him it'd feel waaay worse
[5:08:37] <oneimportantthing> In fact we would be disappointed if you one shotted it
[5:08:42] <%Bread_Assassin> Reggie should be more worried about risky sips.
[5:08:43] <sothatsprettybrutal> also literally like, fuck us, who cares about us. just play
[5:08:49] <Darren716> Manus can be a shit with his gimmick
[5:08:52] <%Deasmeister> Doing this on 5 estus is wild
[5:08:56] <Aussie_Manny> You're pretty good. 👉👉
[5:08:58] <%SaintBeau> manus sucks i hate that fight
[5:08:58] <oneimportantthing> M'Anus
[5:09:02] <zashrin777> Absolutely
[5:09:03] <Dabrikishaw> Honestly thought Reggie had it after fight 3. Now I regret not betting each fight
[5:09:06] <emptyantics> Literally fuck chat you’re doing great Reggie
[5:09:07] <+Jiggisnipe> most people probably have 20 sips
[5:09:07] <+blastyoboots> HE'S NOT KINDLED?!?!?!!
[5:09:10] <oak120> clean
[5:09:11] <%cubbywolf> dodged
[5:09:14] <+AkronymCLT> I absolutely did

[5:09:17] <%SaintBeau> respect for being unkindled
[5:09:19] <%cubbywolf> then random roll LUL
[5:09:19] <+セビー> DS and MonHun might have its “git gud”ers, but majority of us wanna see the wall crumble eventually
[5:09:21] <Dio_TR> ALL POINTS IN LETS GO
[5:09:21] <fat_burtreynolds> Put your estus in his Catacombs
[5:09:22] <%BaronVonHan> I kindled the fuck out of it

[5:09:56] <Aussie_Manny> *poke*
[5:09:59] <MinersLoveGames> he's a tough boss no matter what build you're running
[5:10:05] <%cubbywolf> i think he'd do better with a shield
[5:10:12] <sothatsprettybrutal> waggle your catalyst on him to establish dominance
[5:10:13] <%cubbywolf> DED
[5:10:14] <%RemedyofRevenge> If Reggie likes palying at range he has an excellent R2 for that

[5:10:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> LET'S GO REGGIE
[5:10:51] <oneimportantthing> Reggie the estusholic
[5:10:52] <fat_burtreynolds> KINDLE
[5:10:53] <%Lion_kun> does he still get the damage buff if he shuts down the install?
[5:10:54] <+theoldone001> I love how he resets for when you walk through the fog again
[5:10:54] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, Reggie don't think about us. Just fight
[5:10:58] <ALvl78Zapdos> YOU GOT THIS
[5:10:59] <%phistymcnutz56> anyone have an attempt number? just got here
[5:10:59] <+AkronymCLT> I didn't even realise you could shut it down lol
[5:11:00] <+steelmorrigan> I think he'd do betetr actuall reading the attaclks as opposd to spamming moves in a damage race
[5:11:03] <%cubbywolf> next turn in this turn based RPG
[5:11:05] <%WutangchickeN> Reggie is learning the matchup is 9/1 for Artorias
[5:11:07] <Archmortal> to be fair, waiting longer to sip wasn't safe cuz every stab has landed anyway
[5:11:07] <ChungusQuest> thirsty for that abussy
[5:11:08] <KyberNasse> you cant sip if youre dead
[5:11:11] <MinersLoveGames> yeah I've made that good before
[5:11:14] <%cubbywolf> shouldnt you use the spears instead of the soulmass
[5:11:15] <oneimportantthing> We're all having a great time don't worry
[5:11:22] <Darren716> Soul mass is free damage
[5:11:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> @phistymcnutz56 on betting poll on top of chat
[5:11:24] <+POUND_CAKE94> 3k on Nah I think he needs a breather
[5:11:25] <%Rafoki> @phistymcnutz56 this will be 19
[5:11:28] <%Lion_kun> switch it to power within and pop it outside the door
[5:11:36] <DismalFaith1> should start the fight with soulmass before the fog
[5:11:36] <%justcallmebobplease> Soul Mass is not doing as good of damage as the Spears, it's true.
[5:11:37] <Darren716> No reason not to pop soul mass as a passive
[5:11:41] <+Breaknoon> turn based combat, gotta choose attack or heal.
[5:11:43] <+Jiggisnipe> power within dusk crown big damage
[5:11:43] <deeriojim> soul mass is good to set up when space happens
[5:11:43] <+extradopeness> it took me like 50 tries my first run
[5:11:46] <%cubbywolf> dont worry reggie i voted for you!
[5:11:53] <%phistymcnutz56> @Th3SmartAlec big thank you - i'm very blind lol
[5:11:53] <Darren716> @WoolieVersus Maybe try the dusk crown for the boosted damage?
[5:11:55] <emptyantics> Hey the R2 for the MLGS is also good
[5:11:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:11:56] <+theoldone001> Reggie Hollowed out
[5:11:56] <+セビー> soul mass does damage while he dodges, its passive progress
[5:11:56] <Pubstar_LTD> You got this Reggie!
[5:11:58] <%BaronVonHan> You got this one. Dodge timing is good, just be more careful with punishes and sips
[5:11:58] <+Fefe41> This playthrough is just a schadenfreude party for all of us
[5:11:58] <%cubbywolf> sure i only voted 10 points BUT I VOTED!
[5:12:01] <%funya_rinpa> down to 0 points from all this rapid gambling BibleThump
[5:12:03] <Aussie_Manny> Artorias has put the fear of god in Reggarth.
[5:12:09] <+POUND_CAKE94> Manus was my baddie first time through. Took at least 20
[5:12:14] <%cubbywolf> its not the gambling its the poor choices
[5:12:16] <nimu290> i believe
[5:12:18] <%BignanasTheGawd> I think soul mass is fine, just not a main source of damage
[5:12:23] <+kevlarkoala> beating this with a sub >50 count is honestly "you did great" in my book
[5:12:25] <oneimportantthing> Just wait for M'Anus
[5:12:26] <%cubbywolf> DODGED
[5:12:31] <%cubbywolf> DODGED X2
[5:12:36] <KyberNasse> Artorias is that guy at the arcades
[5:12:37] <emptyantics> The last boss of this DLC took me 32 tries
[5:12:39] <+セビー> hand of fate
[5:12:42] <%cubbywolf> aw that hit
[5:12:43] <Dragon_Batman> If anything soulmass early then switch off for the rest maybe
[5:12:44] <Aussie_Manny> how
[5:12:46] <huskarl_zap> @oneimportantthing LOL LUL
[5:12:52] <+kevlarkoala> i never bother counting my own attempts but i know for sure Reggie's going to beat my record
[5:12:53] <%cubbywolf> downloaded
[5:12:58] <%cubbywolf> worth the try
[5:12:58] <Warfey> oof
[5:13:01] <Aussie_Manny> oooooh, Reggie has downloaded quite well!
[5:13:04] <velgaduere> super close
[5:13:09] <%SaintBeau> you have R2 as well
[5:13:15] <+セビー> fuck legit manus, i was so done by then, sniped his ass and bounced outta the dlc
[5:13:18] <Charlie99993> Part of spacing is being close enough when you need to be
[5:13:27] <%cubbywolf> yeah the casting time vs dps of soul mass isnt wurf
[5:13:27] <%justcallmebobplease> @A_German_Spy am I crazy, or can you stunlock Artorias out of one of his buffs if you hit him enough/hard enough/etc.?
[5:13:30] <+Breaknoon> yeah, the projectile, probably wont do much damage tho
[5:13:32] <fat_burtreynolds> F E A R
[5:13:36] <anthropomorphictempest> not on the flip
[5:13:41] <MattGetsGood> Oh, just in time
[5:13:44] <Charlie99993> @justcallmebobplease That's always been a thing
[5:13:45] <oneimportantthing> HODL
[5:13:45] <T_Doobie> the mix is true
[5:13:48] <%BaronVonHan> nice
[5:13:53] <subjectg> The flip is one of his safest moves
[5:13:54] <%phistymcnutz56> he on his ass lol
[5:13:57] <fat_burtreynolds> Wrong butt press
[5:14:00] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease If you break his poise before he finishes that charging explosion AoE, yes, you prevent him from getting the buff
[5:14:01] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:14:01] <Aussie_Manny> AAARTHUUUR

[5:15:08] <@Menitta> I fully believe in Reggie
[5:15:08] <+birddotexe> YOU'VE GOT THIS
[5:15:08] <+polothegreatest> OSFrog PJSalt
[5:15:09] <+itsKrisD> fuck soulmass
[5:15:09] <NumbF4ke> power within def better than soulmass for this
[5:15:10] <iamtheTwitchghost> IS THIS THE ONE????
[5:15:10] <%BaronVonHan> damn
[5:15:10] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:15:11] <+extradopeness> THE RUN
[5:15:11] <Equirah> he doesn't, not yet
[5:15:12] <ArvidOnFire> now EXPOSE HIM
[5:15:12] <SoaringTrumpet> the struggle continues, the battle wages on
[5:15:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> KINDLE REGGIE YOU GOT THIS
[5:15:12] <+oz_suka> Reggy getting hollow
[5:15:12] <Puhff> C-C-C-C-Combo'd!
[5:15:14] <KaiserMario> I think Reggie's super salty, so Woolie better shut up! LUL LUL LUL
[5:15:17] <%BignanasTheGawd> Nvm, lose the soul mass
[5:15:17] <%SaintBeau> actually Artorias is killing him
[5:15:17] <%Tearonex> I think Reggie needs a mini break
[5:15:19] <+POUND_CAKE94> I’m rich bitch
[5:15:20] <+polothegreatest> woolieYIKES woolieYIKES
[5:15:22] <%thedankestmeeme> yeah reggie why you keep trying new stuff?
[5:15:22] <%Lion_kun> I never had trouble with that jump attack funnily
[5:15:24] <agustorm123> Nah Artorias is killing him LUL
[5:15:24] <fat_burtreynolds> When he does that sweep, does it go back to front?
[5:15:25] <oneimportantthing> $REG to the mooooooon
[5:15:26] <iamtheTwitchghost> he should swap the soulmass
[5:15:26] <%Tearonex> he's been going at it
[5:15:27] <nimu290> soulmass is killing you
[5:15:27] <youngking_kush> it's about DOS
[5:15:29] <SarcFa> He's not close enough to swing when soul massing
[5:15:30] <Aussie_Manny> Chat, does Artorias have anymore moves? Or have we seen everything?
[5:15:30] <OhGeeWhy> 2 swings or 2 spears
[5:15:30] <+Aldra_E> Yes it is Reggie, stop denying it lol
[5:15:33] <%Lion_kun> Swap it for PW
[5:15:34] <Archmortal> The Soulmass is not only a waste of an opening, it often misses half or more of its damage
[5:15:34] <youngking_kush> DPS
[5:15:35] <%funya_rinpa> magic is definitely killing you
[5:15:35] <Warfey> the opportunity cost, tho
[5:15:36] <andre11dr> Remember R2 Reggie, you had a chance to get multiple of those in
[5:15:36] <%MajorCrasher> woolie is right
[5:15:38] <subjectg> @aussie_manny that’s it
[5:15:38] <%SaintBeau> @Aussie_Manny we've seen it all
[5:15:39] <+oz_suka> Does he though?
[5:15:39] <%cubbywolf> dont listen reggie, soul mass will win!
[5:15:39] <+mechslayer71> I should've been betting, I'd be tax haven rich by now
[5:15:39] <+TopTieramisu> reggie's got this. just needs to get the right run
[5:15:40] <Charlie99993> The frog attack's always what gets him
[5:15:41] <%WutangchickeN> If Reggie turtles up with a bigger shield and puts his staff on main hand he can tank it
[5:15:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Aussie_Manny pretty sure thats everything
[5:15:47] <KaiserMario> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[5:15:48] <oneimportantthing> His mindset gets screwed over by trying to do magic
[5:15:48] <+Aldra_E> Not wrong Woolie
[5:15:49] <%BisoromiBear> also the mlgs has a ranged attack for those charging moments
[5:15:53] <+swesterly> Soulmass breaks the rhythm of the fight
[5:15:55] <+theoldone001> Soul Mass is fine if you don't need to heal and can set it up. Not when he's about to jump way over you
[5:15:57] <%MajorCrasher> don't ever let him finish charging if you can help it
[5:15:59] <+セビー> nah, soul mass can do it
[5:15:59] <+Shishi1205> use R2 too Reggie try it once
[5:15:59] <deeriojim> @Lion_kun he is rolling a bit to much to the side, so he loses distance I think
[5:16:01] <agustorm123> what about that pyro
[5:16:05] <%phistymcnutz56> Last run I did of DS1 I got Artorias in 7-8 tries with the bass cannon
[5:16:08] <%SaintBeau> GO REGGIE socpens2FAST GO REGGIE socpens2FAST GO REGGIE socpens2FAST
[5:16:09] <derap41> He ses you casting
[5:16:11] <oneimportantthing> Soulmass makes Reggie try to gain distance when Artorias doesn't allow it
[5:16:11] <%cubbywolf> just take the controller from him and beat the boss and give it back to him and then castrate him
[5:16:12] <+Aldra_E> Is he enjoying doing tho? xD
[5:16:12] <+Shishi1205> R2
[5:16:12] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[5:16:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> it was pretty safe that one round
[5:16:22] <+Jiggisnipe> charging from a distance is fine
[5:16:22] <Aaronc123425> random pitchfork lol
[5:16:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why not try power within again
[5:16:25] <+Shishi1205> if you are far and want DMG R2
[5:16:26] <%Deasmeister> Also moonlight R2 is good for out of spears
[5:16:27] <comicalmond> enigmaZone enigmaZone
[5:16:32] <%funya_rinpa> you're rarely that far though, and you have no idea what he's gonna follow up with
[5:16:33] <%Lion_kun> @deeriojim That's probably it, when he preps for that jump, I always mvoe towards him and roll when he jumps
[5:16:34] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus why does reggie still have his wand as a off-hand weapon?
[5:16:38] <SixthShinx> R2rias
[5:16:41] <%cubbywolf> mix
[5:16:41] <%Lion_kun> I kinda outdash it
[5:16:43] <%justcallmebobplease> Moonlight R2 is actually lit af w/ Artorias.
[5:16:46] <%cubbywolf> well this is a good start
[5:16:50] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:16:59] <dundore77> he's also not dying too often while casting he's casting at good times just getting hit after the missles go off
[5:17:00] <linSP> Two hand r2 is great
[5:17:00] <Archmortal> while Woolie's advice about R2 is good, I would fucking laugh so hard if it put the durability at risk mid-fight
[5:17:00] <HotSauceFiend> can you set homing before entering the room?
[5:17:02] <%BaronVonHan> @Equirah You're right
[5:17:03] <Aussie_Manny> This is Emiya vs Lancelot.
[5:17:11] <agustorm123> Love that dodge
[5:17:11] <fat_burtreynolds> Uh oh, Reggie’s hallowing out guys
[5:17:18] <+Shishi1205> I like this combination
[5:17:22] <rasamune> No he's not
[5:17:31] <+Zidart> is this guy resistant to magic or am I  misremembering?
[5:17:32] <Charlie99993> @Aussie_Manny Medea vs Lancelot
[5:17:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no he's back to spamming spells
[5:17:34] <+Shishi1205> short distance r1 long distance l1
[5:17:34] <%cubbywolf> someone give this man the heimlich because he is choking

[5:19:45] <kragavash> can he drop soulmass for more casts on the other?
[5:19:46] <%funya_rinpa> the doubters picked me clean a while ago
[5:19:47] <notcumf> swords gonna break if he does more r2s
[5:19:50] <agustorm123> now is piss easy
[5:19:52] <%BisoromiBear> the r2 needs more respect, it's way better than csm for this
[5:19:54] <Dragon_Batman> He could do it with just one kindle
[5:19:54] <+theoldone001> has this been the most boss runs?
[5:19:58] <%BignanasTheGawd> At some point, Reggie turned into the under dog
[5:19:58] <oneimportantthing> After he aced O&S this is well deserved
[5:19:58] <youngking_kush> Repair the sword
[5:20:00] <jackelzxaa> he should heal the sword

[5:20:10] <jackelzxaa> unlike ds2 the sword doesnt go back up when you sit
[5:20:13] <+Rafraud> and Reggie thought this was free
[5:20:19] <%Deasmeister> Most people do it with 20 its fine
[5:20:20] <TheButtravage> @kragavash Only if he owns more casts for the others.  Not sure if he has 2 souls spears or not.
[5:20:22] <%BignanasTheGawd> Soul arrow?
[5:20:22] <linSP> you have R2! It came with your sword!
[5:20:25] <%Lion_kun> Use PW outside the boss door
[5:20:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just cast before entering

[5:20:54] <HotSauceFiend> is 10 the max estus? Cant he kindle the bonfire or something?
[5:20:54] <+kevlarkoala> Reggie when stomping a difficult boss with ease: all smiles. Reggie when having to fight straight up: all hollow LUL

[5:21:15] <+LeaIsChill> The voices in my head tell me to kill the boss :)
[5:21:17] <%Lion_kun> Reggie doesn't like kindling because it hurts his pride

[5:23:20] <deeriojim> @Pillagius I think the hp restoring is to small to be significant
[5:23:20] <+Shishi1205> @woolieversus can also use the dusk crown
[5:23:21] <+Aldra_E> Pls fuck off soul mass
[5:23:21] <%Lion_kun> soul mass is good for enemies but not bosses
[5:23:24] <catasteroid0> he can still cast soul mass before going in
[5:23:25] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus as a side note, spells can do bonus counter hit damage, which makes crystal soul spear explode enemies
[5:23:27] <thefranchise00> its getting heated
[5:23:27] <%vVAstrAVv> im sick of this magic prejudice
[5:23:28] <+mechslayer71> Reggie is gonna go even harder on magic if he wins like this

[5:24:33] <ChoculaUltra> no no, don't hollow out Reggie, everyone fucks up in Souls games.
[5:24:33] <+Double_Tap_That> @TheMadDemoknight 20
[5:24:34] <foghornleghorn55> you are basically a glass cannon
[5:24:35] <subjectg> ! OVERCONFIDENCE !
[5:24:35] <SoaringTrumpet> not true, this is a real challenge
[5:24:35] <+Aldra_E> IT IS supposed to be a real fight lol
[5:24:36] <%Pillagius> @deeriojim to heal up from an attack - no. To keep DOT from Power Within at bay - yes
[5:24:38] <%MajorCrasher> Reggie, people take hours to beat this
[5:24:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SUPER REAL
[5:24:38] <leomuratore> Wouldn't take that for granted...
[5:24:39] <Dragon_Batman> You need to respect this game more REggie LUL
[5:24:40] <%cubbywolf> Reggie is just upset we like the boss more than him
[5:24:41] <Archmortal> trying to "not real fight" Artorias doesn't work
[5:24:41] <+ArtemisCroc> reggie you're fighting one of the hardest bosses in the game
[5:24:42] <+セビー> if this is what artorias does, whats kalameet or manus gonna do to him
[5:24:47] <%cubbywolf> DODGED
[5:24:47] <foghornleghorn55> This is the consequence of your build
[5:24:49] <%Deasmeister> It is a real fight the damage is still real
[5:24:54] <+Amaideus> Man, I remember nearly beating a boss in a later game on the 3rd try, then taking 36 tries total to actually beat it
[5:24:58] <+Amaideus> It happens
[5:25:01] <%cubbywolf> bonk
[5:25:03] <%MajorCrasher> @sebbers_and_eggs that's what I'm saying LUL
[5:25:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh man if this boss gets to him that bad...... Kappa Kappa Kappa
[5:25:05] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Now I feel bad for betting against Reggie
[5:25:08] <Darren716> Oh shit he's not on crystal
[5:25:08] <Aussie_Manny> khadBonk bonk
[5:25:09] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S !
[5:25:11] <velgaduere> the greed is too strong
[5:25:12] <kragavash> the regression is real
[5:25:12] <%Seiryu92> Reggie has the download but he needs to unzip the file
[5:25:14] <%cubbywolf> ooooh
[5:25:15] <%BinaryFireball> oh finally
[5:25:16] <yukichocomilk> I mean, reggie is kinda cheating himself out of learning a cool fight. it is what it is
[5:25:17] <%cubbywolf> so close
[5:25:18] <%BinaryFireball> I love this fight
[5:25:20] <@Menitta> good trade
[5:25:22] <Equirah> ooooh that was spicy
[5:25:23] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[5:25:24] <+ArtemisCroc> "the download"
[5:25:24] <GAAAAAWD> reggies fashion is tight
[5:25:25] <%cubbywolf> DODGED
[5:25:26] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:25:27] <binocu__lars> magic pixel!
[5:25:27] <Dio_TR> WHAT
[5:25:28] <GAAAAAWD> whall a cool guy
[5:25:29] <Puhff> Jebaited
[5:25:30] <+Shishi1205> almost beating and beating a boss are very different things
[5:25:30] <velgaduere> GIGA greed
[5:25:31] <+Breaknoon> daamn
[5:25:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no he's hollow
[5:25:32] <%kyh9> WHAT
[5:25:34] <SoaringTrumpet> @andre11dr exactly, plenty of folks spend hours on Artorius
[5:25:34] <subjectg> It went over his head
[5:25:35] <Aussie_Manny> Tanking hits while drinking looks so goofy. LUL
[5:25:38] <Dragon_Batman> It's funny how the triple overhead gets everyone, I got hit there too
[5:25:42] <%cubbywolf> cmon artorias, this boss is just a mob character to you now, BEAT HIM!
[5:25:43] <+DenpaDev> reggie actually hollowing :(
[5:25:44] <fruscib> a slow and insidious killer...
[5:25:47] <dundore77> @yukichocomilk hes learned the fight. stop complaining cause he's using spells he's seen everything art can do
[5:25:49] <+Aldra_E> Can he just try not using magic once? Dunno why he feels compelled to use it xD
[5:25:52] <SikSikSikki> Reggie's feelin' like me trying to fight Isshin, the Sword Saint in Sekiro. Final boss and I never beat him.
[5:25:53] <Brand0n_g> Done give up
[5:25:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just realized Arty has the same breathing than the Pursuer
[5:25:57] <Equirah> spark and joy have left reggie
[5:25:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:26:00] <foghornleghorn55> Your doing well for the kind of build you're rocking with
[5:26:01] <oneimportantthing> Reggie needs more confidence
[5:26:03] <agustorm123> time to use it fast
[5:26:05] <BurdRightsActivist> Reggie failing his virtue save
[5:26:07] <Aussie_Manny> Because Reggie likes using magic.
[5:26:07] <notcumf> warning imminent hollowing
[5:26:09] <anthropomorphictempest> Artorius and Manus were tough but Kalameet is fucking INSIDIOUS
[5:26:10] <ALvl78Zapdos> The triumph when we overcome this boss is going to be legendary.
[5:26:18] <binocu__lars> beautiful dodge
[5:26:18] <Archmortal> that was a choke
[5:26:20] <FibroidWorm39> oh my god he's so god damn cool!!!
[5:26:22] <%MajorCrasher> never let him powerup if you can help it Reggie
[5:26:22] <%townzzzzz> BRAIN ON THE FRZITS
[5:26:22] <deeriojim> ! Reggie at risk !
[5:26:25] <agustorm123> is he trying to backstab him?
[5:26:29] <%cubbywolf> POCKET SLUDGE
[5:26:34] <emptyantics> Kalameet is a BLOODBORNE enemy stuck in DS 1
[5:26:38] <%NahmenJayden> he's got the circle strafe down tho
[5:26:41] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S ! !
[5:26:44] <%cubbywolf> A R T O R I A S !
[5:26:47] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie won't be happy when he wins cuz he thinks it's not supposed to a be real fight
[5:26:49] <+TopTieramisu> THE DAMAGE
[5:26:50] <binocu__lars> god that roll is the coolest
[5:26:52] <ChoculaUltra> seeing the spinning overhead slash after playing PS2 Berserk is so bittersweet. From Soft really loved Berserk FeelsBadMan
[5:26:55] <+extradopeness> kalameet is from kings field you goober
[5:26:57] <TheButtravage> @emptyantics Manus is closer to that honestly.
[5:26:58] <yukichocomilk> might as well unequip the sword
[5:26:59] <anthropomorphictempest> @emptyantics That shit made Manus look like Moonlight Butterfly to me lol

[5:34:06] <+Shishi1205> abyss greatsword
[5:34:06] <SikSikSikki> Is Artorias like, hands-down the coolest mother fucker in Souls? I can't think of anyone cooler. Some come close, but never better.
[5:34:06] <+Iamdenril> did reggie get humbled?
[5:34:07] <nailwind> thank you Miura
[5:34:07] <+extradopeness> miura...
[5:34:10] <%BaronVonHan> Me too, @jorniev, Me too.
[5:34:13] <youngking_kush> DONT USE IT YET
[5:34:13] <%Pillagius> 2 swords and a shield from that souls
[5:34:17] <%MooseIsGoose> another version of his sword
[5:34:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> was that MEAT in the background?
[5:34:30] <%Pillagius> or was it one?
[5:34:36] <%Pillagius> OK. Nvm me...
[5:34:37] <pi_in_the_sci> You can go get his armor now
[5:34:38] <+セビー> i’d make an argument for sif being a smidge cooler than artorias
[5:34:38] <subjectg> @woolieversus the sword you get from arty’s soul is just the one with the cool moveset
[5:34:39] <emptyantics> @siksiksikki Artorias and the Unamed King are kino
[5:34:52] <%cubbywolf> mob psycho season 3 anounced
[5:34:52] <%justcallmebobplease> THAT FUCKING SHIELD
[5:34:53] <tolloponik> its a clean version this one is a corrupted version
[5:34:55] <%justcallmebobplease> THAT SHIELD THO
[5:35:03] <subjectg> @justcallmebobplease sif’s soul makes it
[5:35:09] <SikSikSikki> Unnamed King definitely takes the 2nd spot in my heart for sure.
[5:35:11] <youngking_kush> Abyss GS is Cursed
[5:35:13] <+Shishi1205> scales with humanity
[5:35:14] <+twohitgood> so it's a chaos greatsword.
[5:35:18] <%Bread_Assassin> That's not the only use for the Art's soul.
[5:35:20] <waltzqueen> mmmkmYARGH
[5:35:20] <emptyantics> That shield is the most broken shield in the game
[5:35:22] <velgaduere> it's not great, either way
[5:35:27] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah, Woolie Mentioned it, I can't not pop off at the highest stability shield that nosells poison, toxic, and bleed.
[5:35:28] <+extradopeness> the screams are so good here lol
[5:35:31] <%justcallmebobplease> It's SUCH A GOOD SHIELD
[5:35:35] <+twohitgood> it will also get a bonus from your humanity.
[5:35:41] <heart_ablaze> so you didn't even fight him at full strength
[5:35:44] <%MrATheGreat> Holy shit I was gone for 3 hours and Reggie already beat Arty? Damn Reggie's CRUSHING
[5:35:49] <emptyantics> MOST BROKEN SHIELD
[5:35:51] <%SaintBeau> he's the complete package
[5:35:54] <urkleturtle> it's for ng+++, when you have 30+ in every stat
[5:36:00] <+セビー> that shield can max stability with only normal magic shield
[5:36:02] <Dragon_Batman> And you fought him at his worst
[5:36:03] <+Shishi1205> somersault
[5:36:11] <%justcallmebobplease> @emptyantics I finally did a NG+ run where I had that shield - it made Blight Town such a joke.
[5:36:13] <%townzzzzz> in the left hand
[5:36:18] <KaiserMario> C'MON AND SLAM
[5:36:19] <subjectg> abyss greatsword is one of those weapons you are either way above normal pvp levels for or you have a build exclusively to swing it
[5:36:19] <+extradopeness> @mrathegreat his soul is crushing too!
[5:36:28] <primaryfire> stinger r2 when one handed i think
[5:36:33] <leomuratore> The "C'mon and slam" attack
[5:36:42] <andre11dr> You can also do the spinning attack with it
[5:36:42] <%BaronVonHan> I don't want to spoil anything, but I think the last chapter of Berserk that we got was so bittersweet, that it was as good of a premature ending as we could have gotten.
[5:36:43] <@Solidus_113> might need to teleport away
[5:36:44] <%superc37> @townzzzzz no, only in the right hand. the whole left hand bs what fanfic introduced in ds2

[5:36:49] <%Cozy90> you might have to reload

[5:38:47] <%ncr7wms3r22b7n3> Chat is bloodthirsty
[5:38:49] <+ArtemisCroc> why would you ever give her the soul?
[5:38:49] <Equirah> you can just kill her, and then you get her set as well

[5:39:26] <%funya_rinpa> No downside to killing her, so
[5:39:26] <@Solidus_113> killing her also gives her armour
[5:39:28] <fat_burtreynolds> Carim?
[5:39:29] <available_line> Killing her also gets you her armor set, right?
[5:39:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Trade offer:
[5:39:30] <yukichocomilk> her set also looks super cool
[5:39:30] <youngking_kush> And her armor
[5:39:34] <%BinaryFireball> her armor is dope
[5:39:36] <anthropomorphictempest> plus you get a cool fight
[5:39:36] <SikSikSikki> Crazy Talk Requiem is way too powerful
[5:39:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> how do you get her armor again?
[5:39:38] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Killing her also gets you her armor set, the only way to get her armor is that option.
[5:39:38] <%BinaryFireball> very fashonable
[5:39:38] <Aussie_Manny> But that's so mean! D:
[5:39:38] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus killing her also gives you the armour

[5:40:38] <Aussie_Manny> OWL2019Tracer OWL2019Tracer
[5:40:40] <%robosqueeb> Reggie is crestfallen as fuck right now :(
[5:40:41] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Still a reasonable option, you can read him her armor description as well.
[5:40:41] <+swesterly> Lmao
[5:40:41] <foghornleghorn55> coolest weapon
[5:40:42] <%BaronVonHan> Give Casca Guts' soul
[5:40:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> murder time
[5:40:43] <rasamune> Kickass daggers
[5:40:44] <%Cozy90> BANANA SWORD
[5:40:45] <subjectg> Gold tracer is THE pvp weapon, you see it everywhere
[5:40:46] <Darren716> Then check the rings after
[5:40:48] <%townzzzzz> she wanted that dick
[5:40:49] <SikSikSikki> Her armor is already cool enough to warrant her death. Not sure on its stats but looks? SLAPS.
[5:40:49] <DuoScratch> I never knew you could kill her for her armor...huh. I just always gave her the soul.
[5:40:50] <xxMylord> i wanna be tracer
[5:40:53] <JdotSweapA> lordji1MyGee
[5:40:55] <andre11dr> Interesting, i always swing so i forgot that dialogue LUL
[5:40:59] <+swesterly> Reggie why are you hollow you won fair and square
[5:41:11] <Dragon_Batman> Pride hurts
[5:41:12] <danknugglit> Arent these broken good
[5:41:12] <SoaringTrumpet> yes he did
[5:41:14] <kragavash> Dancer of the Boreal Valley
[5:41:15] <%Prevot> VERY cool moveset
[5:41:16] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie doesn't want to hold the soul, he's still afraid of him Kappa
[5:41:16] <KyberNasse> Oi guvna OWL2019Tracer
[5:41:18] <SunsetJack> The bee
[5:41:18] <+Shishi1205> 3/4
[5:41:18] <anthropomorphictempest> I can't blame Reggie cause Ciaran is rad but damn her outfit is clean
[5:41:20] <TheButtravage> @DuoScratch Yup, you get far more from fighting her. Full armor set, both weapons, and I think she gives like 20k souls.
[5:41:20] <available_line> Artorias's nakama
[5:41:24] <+セビー> i actually only come to the dlc for the dark sorcs and lord blade armor
[5:41:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> is Dancer a reference?
[5:41:27] <lotharrio> Ate too many people to count.
[5:41:35] <fat_burtreynolds> Not the dancer. Bettee
[5:41:36] <andre11dr> Golden Tracer is really broken
[5:41:39] <youngking_kush> 3rd
[5:41:43] <primaryfire> one of the 2 toxic weapons the whole game
[5:41:51] <emptyantics> She’s from DS 3 snow land
[5:41:55] <subjectg> dark silver can toxic but only on one kinda crap attack
[5:41:57] <%RemedyofRevenge> both are great weapons
[5:42:03] <@Solidus_113> Arty, Ciaran, Ornst, and (?...)
[5:42:06] <scrumbotime> If you think about it her daggers work like Anor Londo, you get distracted by the golden illusion, then get stung by the darkmoons
[5:42:11] <Aussie_Manny> ! TOXIC !
[5:42:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> gough
[5:42:18] <+Zxander93> Gold tracer is great since it can actually be used as a weapon in the left hand.
[5:42:19] <+ArtemisCroc> gold main hand
[5:42:22] <@Solidus_113> did his arrows say
[5:42:26] <@Menitta> oh that's very cool
[5:42:27] <+セビー> we’ve seen goughs name a few times now
[5:42:31] <Estwilde> the britney build
[5:42:31] <Dragon_Batman> He should know about gough already, he has his ring
[5:42:33] <+Jiggisnipe> @Solidus_113 he does have the 4th's ring
[5:42:35] <Pigeonsquall> aw what I JUST missed him?!
[5:42:38] <%RemedyofRevenge> you usually want to swap the hands those are in
[5:42:39] <@Solidus_113> okay
[5:42:39] <deeriojim> only weapons that actually somewhat support dual wielding too, IIRC
[5:42:41] <Aussie_Manny> omg the weapon trails
[5:42:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @solidus_113 it's stated in a few places that gough is 1/4
[5:42:44] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus They are the only paired weapons with a unique moveset in the game.
[5:42:45] <jackelzxaa> quelaag's furysword and gold tracer is a wild combo.  unique movesets with cool glowy anime effects
[5:42:47] <Equirah> swap the hands
[5:42:48] <%justcallmebobplease> @andre11dr Switch which dagger is in which hand, check that out too.
[5:42:56] <+mechslayer71> @pigeonsquall all 22 attempts
[5:42:57] <%BaronVonHan> Love the streaks
[5:42:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> SHE'S SO COOL
[5:43:02] <%MooseIsGoose> and they have a different  move set if you change them around
[5:43:02] <JdotSweapA> chew on this. its COOL
[5:43:03] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Reverse the hands too
[5:43:05] <%greatspaceadventure> talk sick
[5:43:05] <bear_breaker20> reminder you start with a reg ass sword in this game
[5:43:07] <subjectg> most people just 2hand the gold tracer and r1 spam though LUL
[5:43:07] <+Jiggisnipe> look at that nerd
[5:43:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> Switch hands
[5:43:11] <zashrin777> These are great against guys with high poise cause you just cut cut cut cut
[5:43:13] <%RemedyofRevenge> swap them around for a different moveset @WoolieVersus
[5:43:14] <%notsoy> ashes to ashes, dust to dust
[5:43:14] <%kewlmyc> Bitch, I'm playing with my new toys
[5:43:14] <leomuratore> S scalling with dex
[5:43:16] <DeathByPoke7> did these weapons ever come back?
[5:43:16] <%BaronVonHan> Yeah, switch hands
[5:43:19] <Pigeonsquall> @mechslayer71 amazing
[5:43:22] <+liquidzr0> shofuMillyrock
[5:43:24] <%MooseIsGoose> switch hands
[5:43:25] <%Pillagius> and if you want to be a butt and get Ciarans armor - you could kill her
[5:43:27] <leomuratore> scaling*
[5:43:27] <$thotbane> @zanzibarian_hamster Feyd Rautha pls
[5:43:29] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus check the r2 with gold tracer
[5:43:32] <%justcallmebobplease> Correct
[5:43:34] <LunarRemix> If you kill her you can get another two of those lol
[5:43:37] <TheButtravage> Nah, he had the right combo.
[5:43:43] <Dopamien> commit murder for cosplay FeelsBadMan
[5:43:45] <andre11dr> @deathbypoke7 No ,but the dancer blades are kinda similar
[5:43:56] <TheButtravage> Silver main hand, gold offhand is the unique set @WoolieVersus
[5:44:00] <%cubbywolf> cool
[5:44:08] <yukichocomilk> @TheButtravage he already did that
[5:44:12] <+ArtemisCroc> this is a move conventional moveset
[5:44:15] <+ArtemisCroc> more*
[5:44:23] <%cubbywolf> small range but fast
[5:44:25] <JdotSweapA> SICK dex weapon
[5:44:30] <subjectg> Gold tracer also inflicts bleed
[5:44:31] <brunoberserk> feels like a soulcalibur moveset
[5:44:32] <%hax_metatron> Don’t kill her. He won’t wear her armor. It’s a waste
[5:44:35] <TheButtravage> @TheButtravage Was just claifying which was the unique one.
[5:44:37] <youngking_kush> I used it
[5:44:37] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[5:44:37] <Paltheos> I prefer my katanas for dex
[5:44:39] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:44:41] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[5:44:42] <+extradopeness> lmao
[5:44:42] <Afrosamasenpai> oof
[5:44:45] <%superc37> the gold tracer is by far the best dex weapon in the game
[5:44:46] <karawra> LUL
[5:44:46] <%Irridium> LUL
[5:44:48] <primaryfire> similar to the painting guardian sword moveset
[5:44:48] <Equirah> LUL
[5:44:50] <Paltheos> Uchi/Washing Pole all the way
[5:44:50] <jorniev> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:44:52] <Aussie_Manny> I get it
[5:44:53] <lotharrio> ...oh those actually look like the Blades of Mercy.
[5:44:53] <SarcFa> Logan's
[5:45:00] <emptyantics> :(
[5:45:09] <%Pillagius> yeah. It's nice but still looses to painting guardian sword or falcion in burst damage since they can't be buffed
[5:45:13] <+masterofdisaster252> how many tries did he needed for artorias?
[5:45:14] <andre11dr> @superc37 Well, except for Dark Moon Facion
[5:45:15] <TheButtravage> Does anyone know if they finished Logan's questline?
[5:45:16] <LtSurge> Weirdly enough her name is an Irish mans name, the female equivalent is Ciara
[5:45:26] <subjectg> @superc37 along with the great scythe, the two weapons that get you dirty looks in pvp
[5:45:27] <%cubbywolf> its goopy
[5:45:28] <AbnormalVoid> now kill :)
[5:45:32] <+Jiggisnipe> @TheButtravage yea he was naked
[5:45:37] <TheButtravage> Thanks.
[5:45:41] <KyberNasse> Now Sephiroth her
[5:45:44] <%Irridium> her head is in perfect beheading position
[5:45:49] <Dragon_Batman> Alrighty, gonna head out. Have a good evening everyone. Don't beat yourself up too bad Reggie, you did great!
[5:45:51] <subjectg> Pearl Harbor that ass
[5:45:55] <%BaronVonHan> The ghost getting pancaked, lol
[5:45:57] <TheButtravage> So he has gotten Tin Crystal he is just choosing to use Logan's.
[5:45:58] <%justcallmebobplease> Time to meet a guy, hopefully
[5:46:00] <%Prevot> now think of where you found the hornet ring
[5:46:03] <derap41> Wouldn't recomend it
[5:46:06] <zashrin777> @masterofdisaster252 22 or 23 i believe
[5:46:07] <+TossuDa> THOUEST
[5:46:17] <LtSurge> Ciaran also means Little Dark One, pointing at how she followed Artorias
[5:46:18] <%cubbywolf> and you saved him
[5:46:23] <%cubbywolf> saved him hard
[5:46:24] <zhenthrim213> WAT A HERO
[5:46:31] <+masterofdisaster252> @zashrin777 nice thank you
[5:46:37] <anthropomorphictempest> Artorias: "Imma go fight off the Abyss."
[5:46:42] <MadBaller123> He stared a little too hard into that abyss
[5:46:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> PogChamp
[5:46:49] <anthropomorphictempest> Artorias, later: "Damn the Abyss got hands."
[5:46:52] <Johannen> Thats the sound of progress my friend
[5:46:54] <+extradopeness> the boy

[5:48:01] <$thotbane> ATTACK THE GAZEBO
[5:48:01] <+theoldone001> He also gave up his shield to save Sif
[5:48:01] <ConflagrationsGaming> PURPLE WHAT
[5:48:05] <agustorm123> Woolie cristal
[5:48:12] <+polothegreatest> woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL
[5:48:12] <%justcallmebobplease> ...Artorias failed to kill the guy, or stop the Abyss proliferation, and even got corrupted to their side - how is that anything but abject failure?
[5:48:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> What the fuck is this
[5:48:14] <velgaduere> it ain't great
[5:48:15] <@Menitta> Ah yes the Hint Heap
[5:48:18] <Awesome_Leaf> supposed to be?
[5:48:19] <subjectg> Everyone just uses the bridge next to it LUL
[5:48:20] <RorBoy> does anyone use this in remaster?
[5:48:20] <zashrin777> lol, forgot this even exists
[5:48:26] <anthropomorphictempest> go back to the future to tell Sif his owner was a fucking phony
[5:48:27] <+theoldone001> Literally everyone just fights a few feet away in the Township bonfire lol
[5:48:36] <%cubbywolf> what
[5:48:37] <%BaronVonHan> It's the thing no one uses
[5:48:39] <SoaringTrumpet> what a clumsy name for this place
[5:48:39] <oda_flobunaga> I attack the gazebo with my sword
[5:48:40] <+EX_shuffle> I loved this for the short time that people used it
[5:48:40] <+セビー> purple crystal, aka wrong warp item
[5:48:51] <$thotbane> @zashrin777 i want to see the level designer's face when they learn that not only does nobody ever use it, but everyone just fights directly outside anyway
[5:48:52] <+FanServ> @justcallmebobplease it's because they didn't realize it  had to be done by a human
[5:48:52] <+dekkitout> What, no ctf? No grifball? Wack
[5:48:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> wow, already better than Halo Infinite Kappa
[5:48:58] <%cubbywolf> oh my god from soft wtf
[5:49:00] <andre11dr> Nobody uses this thing because it works like shit
[5:49:03] <iamtheTwitchghost> imagine ctf dark souls
[5:49:05] <%Juriasu> real arena is right outside lol
[5:49:07] <zashrin777> @thotbane LUL
[5:49:07] <iamtheTwitchghost> it would be awesome
[5:49:08] <velgaduere> this is one of the coolest rooms in the game
[5:49:09] <subjectg> check the list for cheaters
[5:49:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:49:14] <%cubbywolf> LIST OF CHEATERS
[5:49:17] <DSD24> Plague of Legends
[5:49:19] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> it doesn't work well and is cumbersome so no one used this
[5:49:19] <%Irridium> plaque of cheaters
[5:49:19] <+Jiggisnipe> so why don't people use this?
[5:49:24] <@Menitta> dark souls totally doesn't need tutorials
[5:49:24] <RorBoy> List of Cowards
[5:49:28] <resloxxx> PLAGUE OF SHAME
[5:49:33] <+extradopeness> it suuuuuucks
[5:49:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> 12 LUL LUL LUL
[5:49:35] <DSD24> Giant Child!
[5:49:35] <%cubbywolf> well 12 isnt too much
[5:49:38] <JdotSweapA> it KIIIIIIINDA sucks
[5:49:38] <+Amaideus> Because shit doesn't work
[5:49:39] <deeriojim> @Jiggisnipe IIRC, because it isnt correct soul lvls
[5:49:40] <emptyantics> LUL LUL
[5:49:45] <andre11dr> Check out those BIG heroes on list Kappa
[5:49:54] <%cubbywolf> im used to seeing 9999
[5:49:55] <%justcallmebobplease> @FanServ I continue to wonder if they couldn't have cheese that by way of tactics - say, if they just dumped an absurd amount of firebombs on the area, or equivalent in-verse relevant saturation fire method.  Those exist in setting...
[5:49:56] <+extradopeness> oh boy all the slur names!
[5:49:58] <+Jiggisnipe> @deeriojim ah makes sense
[5:49:59] <subjectg> you need to scroll to higher soul levels to see all the cheaters
[5:50:04] <emptyantics> FanServ I continue to wonder if they couldn’t have cheese that by way of tactics - say, if they just dumped an absurd amount of firebombs on the area, or equivalent in-verse relevant saturation fire method.  Those exist in setting...
[5:50:07] <RorBoy> and equipment level
[5:50:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Almost as if.... you should just be able to pick a guy from a list.
[5:50:13] <%Javaa01> Also the maps are bad
[5:50:13] <%cubbywolf> soul level is impossible to match fairly
[5:50:16] <emptyantics> FanServ I continue to wonder if they couldn’t have cheese that by way of tactics - say, if they just dumped an absurd amount of firebombs on the area, or equivalent in-verse relevant saturation fire method.  Those exist in setting..
[5:50:17] <fat_burtreynolds> Usually undead burg or anor londo tbh
[5:50:20] <andre11dr> Surprised there wasn't no 99999999
[5:50:21] <+セビー> the playerbase made their own fight clubs, lol
[5:50:33] <zashrin777> @extradopeness Yeah, like K***ht Artorias
[5:50:37] <RorBoy> and most people pvp in ds2
[5:50:40] <+Jiggisnipe> @justcallmebobplease just use a lot of water SeemsGood
[5:50:42] <subjectg> @andre11dr they only saw the sl 50 and below part
[5:50:44] <%cubbywolf> H O N O R
[5:50:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[5:50:51] <%cubbywolf> DONT BITCH OUT
[5:50:51] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> forrest is great if you like chaos
[5:50:52] <Dabrikishaw> People have done PvP here, but its not as popular and the SL is definitely the main issue. SL50-100 compared to the fanbase's 120-125
[5:50:53] <@Menitta> The notes weren't even organized....
[5:50:54] <%townzzzzz> DON'T RUN BITCH
[5:50:55] <scrumbotime> the pull the plug crystal
[5:50:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DON'T BITCH OUT
[5:50:58] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus You pretty much have to arrange games outside of game to get active matches.  Otherwise all the active PvP is at the Township bonfire at SL125-135 or in Anor Londo around SL50-60.
[5:51:01] <%justcallmebobplease> @Jiggisnipe Huh... is there any water in the DLC besides around Kalameet's area?
[5:51:03] <+extradopeness> CAPITULATION
[5:51:05] <%BaronVonHan> Bitch crystal
[5:51:10] <+extradopeness> A DISGRACE
[5:51:11] <%cubbywolf> its crazy and why put it in DLC
[5:51:11] <RorBoy> look at all that blood
[5:51:12] <linSP> here it is, don’t use it
[5:51:17] <andre11dr> People use tha Garden to pvp in DS1
[5:51:20] <KyberNasse> Dont do the LTG combo
[5:51:22] <+EX_shuffle> It was used for a couple weeks
[5:51:22] <subjectg> Go human here Kappa
[5:51:23] <+Jiggisnipe> @justcallmebobplease idk I'm just referencing New Londo lol
[5:51:23] <@Solidus_113> Works worse than DNF Duel beta
[5:51:26] <+ArtemisCroc> I get games on it using a discord server
[5:51:28] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:51:32] <+Mrbaconator> FIGHT CLUB
[5:51:32] <%cubbywolf> get specific soul level
[5:51:33] <iamtheTwitchghost> Get Into Dark Souls PvP when?
[5:51:34] <@Menitta> @solidus_113 OOOOF
[5:51:36] <youngking_kush> Yeah it sucks, just invade here lol
[5:51:43] <nailwind> zoners are born with that crystal
[5:51:45] <nooowaayjose> this is a good pvp spot
[5:51:45] <%cubbywolf> dark souls pvp, especialy 1, is ba nar nars
[5:51:45] <%Javaa01> Yeah people would rather just PvP at this exact bonfire instead
[5:51:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus All those bloodpools nehimd you  are the actual duel spot you might have seen in the Giant Dad meme
[5:51:48] <RorBoy> you can see all the pvp deaths LUL
[5:51:49] <Jontman42> the spot literally right outside it is the actual pvp place lol
[5:51:51] <TheButtravage> @andre11dr Darkroot is pretty dead now on PC.
[5:52:00] <+extradopeness> yeah this is the real pvp zone
[5:52:00] <ghilbor> or use infernoplus' dark soul remastest mod and have rooms that actually work
[5:52:06] <subjectg> he has one new dialogue i think
[5:52:09] <%cubbywolf> LUL the pvp arena is outside the official pvp arena
[5:52:14] <youngking_kush> Yeah he has new dialogue
[5:52:14] <%BaronVonHan> The spot you're sitting now is where people fight
[5:52:15] <%cubbywolf> thats honestly funny shit
[5:52:15] <%justcallmebobplease> @Jiggisnipe Fair 'nuff, but New Londo was conveniently wall-surrounded.  I think you'd need to Noah it up, to flood out the past of Oolacile with how open it is.
[5:52:21] <velgaduere> he already forgot his name
[5:52:25] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus lmao, yeah those bloodstains near the bonfire are all pvp matches.
[5:52:31] <RorBoy> chestnuts
[5:52:36] <Chatterbox1991> Astorias?
[5:52:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[5:52:39] <%cubbywolf> pain
[5:52:39] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:52:40] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's as they say. The arena system in DS1 is worthless. And even when you DO get a match, the arenas are all basically the same with no variation in terrain, and all the participants start off right next to each other, so it always becomes a clusterfuck.
[5:52:43] <zashrin777> Get this boy a snickers bar

[5:53:44] <subjectg> We can also imply from this dialogue that Chester is a moth lady simp
[5:53:45] <%justcallmebobplease> Gee, who could 'a toothy serpent' be...
[5:53:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> I can't stop thinking of Plague's video LUL
[5:53:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS NEED?
[5:53:49] <TheButtravage> @andre11dr Yeah, meta township is still active and SL50-60 in Anor Londo has actually gotten more poplar than Darkroot invasions.  There are some people that still hang out in forest but I mostly just get people going to Sif.
[5:53:50] <+dekkitout> So Oolicile drank the old blood too, huh...
[5:53:52] <RorBoy> fuck with Man and find out

[5:55:26] <linSP> Chester got the best drip if you can kill him
[5:55:27] <zashrin777> Chester is such a cool npc. I know that bloodborne is basically just future lordran, but the fact that this guy is LITERALLY from future Lordran is really interesting.
[5:55:31] <subjectg> “For my moth queen’s sake.”
[5:55:45] <+extradopeness> To feed off the humanity of manus' corpse the primeval man!
[5:55:49] <%cubbywolf> a belly full of pizza
[5:55:49] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Can you tell Reggie he's still doing way better than most on his 1st time around?
[5:55:50] <%justcallmebobplease> @zashrin777 What confirms he's from future Lordran, specifically?
[5:55:50] <emptyantics> Remember when Bloodborne was called BEAST SOULS

[5:56:06] <TheButtravage> @andre11dr Dead Angles don't work in Remaster.  Lot of the advanced tech in PTDE doesn't work in Remaster so shields are stronger and backstab yomi is a bigger thing.
[5:56:09] <leomuratore> GGs!!!!
[5:56:10] <%SaintBeau> i want curry now
[5:56:11] <Vi_Stri> ox tail Kreygasm

[5:56:41] <ConflagrationsGaming> GREAT JOB REGGIE
[5:56:41] <subjectg> @thebuttravage yeah pvp in ds1 would be much better if the backstab mechanic wasn’t like this and the hornet ring was deleted from existence
[5:56:42] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne would have been connected to demon's souls, not dark souls
[5:56:42] <+swesterly> It’s weird but it doesn’t seem like Reggie gets that souls struggle adapt overcome catharsis
[5:56:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> how ya feeling Reggie?
[5:56:44] <karawra> great jobbb

[5:57:19] <fat_burtreynolds> Biggest and Strongest Reggie
[5:57:22] <velgaduere> it kinda does for a whole game
[5:57:23] <subjectg> Every other session reggie hollows out LUL
[5:57:29] <%justcallmebobplease> There would be a sort of magic to it, if Reggie just tripped his way to success the whole way.
[5:57:30] <youngking_kush> Souls is gonna Souls
[5:57:38] <TheButtravage> @subjectg I actually like DS1 pvp the most, but I know the mechanic is not well designed.  I wouldn't change it since I enjoy how it currently is.  Could just play any of the other Soulsborne games for different PvP.
[5:57:45] <andre11dr> @thebuttravage Oh i didn't know they removed dead angles ,that's cool ,tho i imagine DM Falcion soam and lag stabbing is still THE problem
[5:57:47] <%jinking79> man is tomorrow last of DS?

[5:58:35] <fat_burtreynolds> S o o K
[5:58:36] <TheButtravage> @andre11dr Only a problem if you don't learn how it works.  There are ways to deal with and counter backstabs and DM falchion isn't as strong since people have learned to out range and wear out the buff or parry it.
[5:58:44] <+pectusumbra> Nito is a little wonky but yeah
[5:58:52] <%BaronVonHan> You pressed the XXX and the YYY
[5:58:52] <%Prevot> and then ds2 is ALL bullshit
[5:58:53] <huskarl_zap> Squid1 PogBones Squid4
[5:58:55] <subjectg> @thebuttravage i don’t mind at all, but imo there’s too much of a gap in enjoyment in ds1 between playing pvp as intended and dealing with meta backstab turtlers and all
[5:59:03] <emptyantics> Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[5:59:10] <Afrosamasenpai> you will be sucked

[5:59:20] <+LeRouch_the_Rebel> weird, but real
[5:59:32] <$thotbane> @pectusumbra I feel like the problem is that people dont know the shriek is a warning about the blade geyser, because why would you assume Nito screams like a woman
[5:59:33] <fat_burtreynolds> Oooof
[5:59:33] <zocano> I like Dark Souls 2 a lot 🤷♀️
[5:59:34] <TheButtravage> @subjectg It's more enjoyable when you play with people around your skill level.  It's not fun when you don't understand it and you get shit on by the playerbase.
[5:59:36] <+ArtemisCroc> DS2 is really good, but you can't rely on skills from DS1 to carry you
[5:59:43] <zocano> Also dem DLCs
[5:59:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There is no part of DS2 that is as bad as BOC

[6:00:16] <agustorm123> YEP
[6:00:16] <+pectusumbra> @thotbane I was just thinking more that Nito is just another Mob-based boss which a lot of people dislike in general. as soon as you remove the skeletons from the fight it's pretty much nothing

[6:00:31] <subjectg> @thebuttravage basically yeah, but i think the pub experience is the most important part of any multiplayer, after all not everyone is gonna have a group to play with or is actively seeking the community
[6:00:31] <Qsmash_> true

[6:00:49] <andre11dr> @thebuttravage Honestly, at this point if i want to pvp I'll do in DS2 or DS3 ,i feel like there's way more versatility in those, in therms what you can do to people
[6:00:53] <Jontman42> you'll become it, too
[6:00:54] <+extradopeness> janet jackson?

[6:01:21] <+Turtleman547> Turtleman547 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:01:25] <Uncle_Christian> Happy days ol boys
[6:01:40] <+ArtemisCroc> magic in DS2 is s much fun, reggie's gonna have a lot to work with
[6:01:55] <andre11dr> Tho those games definitely still have bs ,Climax was a mistake
[6:02:04] <+セビー> Ds2 also introduces true hybrid catalysts
[6:02:17] <TheButtravage> @subjectg I'd agree if the game was built as a competitive with matchmaking of some kind but it's pretty clear that single player is the main focus in this series and co op and pvp are an afterthought.  It's just interesting that the pvp got such a large dedicated following despite never being well balanced.
[6:02:18] <Afrosamasenpai> The truest
[6:02:20] <Aussie_Manny> Lore duel.
[6:02:22] <youngking_kush> It is
[6:02:24] <%A_German_spy> That right there is an astute observation.
[6:02:28] <emptyantics> LADY MARIA
[6:02:29] <%mundanelotus> what a title
[6:02:29] <youngking_kush> Even Bloodborne
[6:02:34] <Jontman42> it's true
[6:02:34] <youngking_kush> Even Sekiro
[6:02:36] <Uncle_Christian> Its
[6:02:37] <leomuratore> Happy Holidays everyone!!! Hope your 2022 is better than 2021. doodShake
[6:02:37] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Ludwiiiiiiiig
[6:02:46] <Jontman42> we love them for it
[6:02:47] <andre11dr> I actually like Manus more than Artorias
[6:02:47] <+extradopeness> my guiding moonlight
[6:02:49] <Johannen> LUDWIG
[6:02:53] <Afrosamasenpai> MARIA
[6:02:55] <emptyantics> MY GUIDING MOONLIGHT
[6:02:58] <@Solidus_113> they love it so much it's the first actual boss in Bloodborne
[6:03:07] <zashrin777> I can see Maria in Woolies eyes right now. LUL
[6:03:07] <+セビー> which one is the lore duel of 2 tho?
[6:03:07] <Johannen> Ludwig is gonna be a pop off for Reggie now
[6:03:10] <%A_German_spy> @Solidus_113 And a few more besides
[6:03:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[6:03:10] <Darren716> Clearly his favorite DS2 boss is Royal Rat Kappa
[6:03:21] <emptyantics> Which is the LORE DUEL  DS2 has?
[6:03:23] <youngking_kush> Ludwig is my favorite boss of all time
[6:03:30] <%hax_metatron> FUME KNIGHT
[6:03:33] <%hax_metatron> ALONNE
[6:03:33] <zocano> Raime probably
[6:03:35] <andre11dr> Gael is pretty much just red more epic Artorias
[6:03:36] <+extradopeness> hes juicin up
[6:03:40] <DeathByPoke7> he is q?
[6:04:00] <%Tearonex> @emptyantics Literally all the fights the the daughters
[6:04:04] <+extradopeness> lol he os kinda like q
[6:04:05] <@Solidus_113> he's channeling the Berserk Armour
[6:04:08] <TheButtravage> @andre11dr Yeah, Gael is pretty much taking the fundamentals of the Artorias fight and expanding on it.
[6:04:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[6:04:18] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> he fought 1 handed. other one is just goop
[6:04:24] <$thotbane> @Darren716 clearly it's Prowling Magus and Congregation
[6:04:28] <Johannen> Gael is nothing...its all about Nameless
[6:04:31] <subjectg> @thebuttravage definitely, i did like the steps they took to make it better in ds2, for me while the single player experience is still amazing, multi is how you keep people playing and remembering, i spent a lot of time in ds2 after all
[6:04:40] <emptyantics> Nameless Kreygasm
[6:04:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus spyAce
[6:04:49] <+extradopeness> nameless is the one Souls boss that i never beat
[6:04:53] <youngking_kush> Friede > Gael
[6:04:59] <Uncle_Christian> lol
[6:04:59] <zocano> I’ve always thought Nameless is a kinda boring fight mechanically.
[6:05:05] <andre11dr> Gundyr is probably my favorite DS3 fight if you don't parry
[6:05:07] <Darren716> thotbane Ngl I forget that boss exists LUL
[6:05:08] <DeathByPoke7> new op
[6:05:12] <KingOmnicide> LUL
[6:05:12] <@Solidus_113> Now await being broken down AGAIN tomorrow woolieMIRIN
[6:05:14] <+セビー> namless needing you to kill his mount every attempt was grating
[6:05:23] <TheButtravage> @subjectg 2 has always been the weakest for me for both pve and pvp but I'd honestly have to learn more of 2's pvp to really critique it properly.  My time with it has always been an issue on PC SotFS though.
[6:05:23] <velgaduere> with his level one million Pikachu
[6:05:26] <zocano> Spectacle is great but Gundyr is my favorite
[6:05:28] <Afrosamasenpai> That's a cute ass mug
[6:05:32] <@Menitta> Dead Weight and The Legendary Dead Weight
[6:05:36] <subjectg> hey guys, cool it with the spoilers postgame, reggie can read during this time
[6:05:36] <youngking_kush> He's Guts man
[6:05:37] <Darren716> Sooo we're totally wrapping things up tomorrow huh?
[6:05:47] <OldManDeckardCain> You are only minus if you are a bitch LUL
[6:05:51] <emptyantics> Prove to them you deserve the TORCH
[6:05:51] <%notsoy> helm breaker is a pretty good button to mash
[6:05:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Darren716 uh huh Kappa
[6:05:57] <%BaronVonHan> Nah, that's calculated unga
[6:06:01] <%A_German_spy> @Darren716 Could be. We're in the home stretch.
[6:06:03] <Uncle_Christian> 'Do' or 'do not', there is no 'try'
[6:06:06] <Darren716> Like the only thing we got left is the back half of the DLC and the 10 minutes of finale
[6:06:09] <leomuratore> Will Reggie keep playing the souls games?
[6:06:09] <zocano> Helmsplitter Helmsplitter Helmsplitter
[6:06:11] <+Mrbaconator> scrubs get mad instead of overcoming LUL
[6:06:18] <andre11dr> He's definitely a Sol player
[6:06:26] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> "If I'm a masher why did you get counter hit?"
[6:06:27] <+extradopeness> it still works!
[6:06:36] <leomuratore> It works!
[6:06:36] <youngking_kush> @darren716 I feel like Woolie might do a big lore dump-cast thing at the end
[6:06:39] <+Mrbaconator> scrub is entirely attitude based not skill level
[6:06:45] <+extradopeness> broken clocks etc
[6:06:48] <velgaduere> did the stream player just reset for anyone else?
[6:06:50] <andre11dr> Actually no ,Artorias plays Slayer
[6:06:52] <youngking_kush> Depending how the sessions go
[6:06:55] <subjectg> @thebuttravage it takes some getting used to if you’re familiar with ds1 and ds3 since it’s kinda different, but I recommend finding scott jund’s stuff to see how it’s played at the advanced level
[6:06:56] <agustorm123> He forgot about the boss with Nitto

[6:07:41] <+sniffy77> Woolie is cool
[6:07:51] <youngking_kush> The splat
[6:07:53] <andre11dr> Nitto is a awesome design but a kinda wack fight

[6:08:41] <TheButtravage> @subjectg I'm a the point where I probably won't bother learning the other games unless I learn from someone directly,  otherwise I'll just play the one I enjoy the most for now.
[6:08:45] <leomuratore> A completely defensive mindset
[6:09:07] <subjectg> @thebuttravage that’s fair, just wanted to make my case

[6:10:50] <TheButtravage> @subjectg I mean, they all have their dedicated followings for a reason so I'm sure there' enough to enjoy with all of them. I just don't have enough experience to critique and compare the pvp aspects of all the games.  PvE on the other hand I think I have a fair enough experience to make comparisons for those.
