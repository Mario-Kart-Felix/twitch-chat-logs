[0:11:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @datasuna 911 lite
[0:11:57] <Belakitu> Need a Caspar Mattress?
[0:12:00] <%TheTyper> Is that like...a non-emergency health care service?
[0:12:09] <diegobandzz> 811 is like webmd
[0:12:09] <exnuart> @DatAsuna non emergency line
[0:12:11] <%ekodrop> it's 100 less than 911
[0:12:12] <+askalta> lol they for you into an ambulance to bill you here in hte u,s
[0:12:18] <%TheTyper> Man we need that in the US.
[0:12:19] <+Bitscreed> I assume 811 is Canada's equivalent of UK's 111 for non-emergency stuff
[0:12:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait is this a canada only thing or is there a thing in the us too
[0:12:25] <leith_aziz> Are they faster?
[0:12:29] <%TheTyper> Too many people down here call 911 for bs
[0:12:32] <%Necnill> Yeah, UK's 111 is the shit
[0:12:34] <available_line> We need that in EVERY country, not just the US.
[0:12:35] <ToxInjection> Canada's non-emergency line is great
[0:12:35] <SivSarcast> I legit never heard of 811 before
[0:12:40] <diegobandzz> Like this hurts but I’m not dying?
[0:12:42] <Belakitu> Does the US have that? That sounds really nice

[0:13:21] <yficaptions> english and french?
[0:13:26] <%TheTyper> 811 in the US is like....there's poison control....
[0:13:32] <Tisaric> 811 does exist in the US but it's not about health
[0:13:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Anyone have the emergency number from IT Crowd memorized?

[0:34:44] <+EternalJedi> I'm part way through it now, paused for stream rooVV
[0:34:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Any flex is worth a BJ, the difference is how much say you have on who gives it.
[0:34:45] <derap41> Reggie looks so tiny with the camera zoomed out
[0:34:46] <%thetunnelhomer> DatAsuna is a hero.
[0:34:51] <Equirah> C O N T E N T
[0:34:52] <ingman112> Shit is baller
[0:34:52] <SivSarcast> That Reggie narration at the start was pretty disco.
[0:34:54] <%khalcipher> Im still checking out part 1, but its very fun so far
[0:34:57] <BigManLugan> Asuna killed it
[0:35:00] <%Vigonept> it was rad yo
[0:35:03] <+MightyDuckShoes> What "is" the Asuna cut?
[0:35:07] <DatAsuna> Will do, furniture first. xD
[0:35:24] <+MightyDuckShoes> I never really understood what was going on there outside of being a compilation
[0:35:34] <%bumpynavel> Take more breaks than you need.
[0:35:42] <DatAsuna> and pay to do it.
[0:35:43] <%ggbhtg> Hmm hmm
[0:35:44] <%TheTyper> Yeah, public callouts.
[0:35:45] <pennykettle_> Dono is guaranteed read
[0:35:45] <Zayasu> he even paid to do it
[0:35:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Mossad wants to send a message
[0:35:55] <%JustYudha> lol yeah he even paid money??
[0:35:56] <heartlesshealer> just wanted to bully
[0:36:03] <+anoldtoilet> i mean its fucked up. dont even entertain it
[0:36:05] <+glgzephyr> I think he just wanted to guarantee that you would read it. That's the motivation for a bunch of sketchy donations
[0:36:12] <%BisoromiBear> it happens
[0:36:18] <ToxInjection> It's a touchy subject for people. Emotions will get involved.
[0:36:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> that wasn't a person that type of shit happens, look it up
[0:36:24] <aiutare47> With a name like “Benjamin Goldstein” he was trolling you and looking for attention
[0:36:25] <teefpal> as a jew, I'm so tired of ultrazionists
[0:36:26] <+anoldtoilet> its literally antisemitic to say criticism of israel is antisemitic. saying war crimes and genocide is a fundamental part of jewish identity is antisemitic
[0:36:30] <derap41> He wanted a "Whoops" moment
[0:36:31] <spaceitaly> gonna send you a hundred bucks to tell you that you're wrong about the zapping system
[0:36:33] <%bumpynavel> Hitlerdidnothingwrongexcepttargetedthewrongpeople wants to send you a message
[0:36:34] <iacus_> Absolutely agree
[0:36:36] <%kyh9> What are we talking about?
[0:36:38] <DatAsuna> @MightyDuckShoes Basically the main body of it is still an edited comp, just with new jokes and edits. The intro is a fanmade lore reading based on the minstrel stories in the game.
[0:36:39] <pillowheadgirl> it was just for theatrics
[0:36:43] <+illusiveSaint> sometimes people dono just to state their own opinions too and flex
[0:36:45] <+mechslayer71> Wha happun?
[0:36:49] <Broand> I missed that sub donation
[0:36:49] <CappuccinoGuil> God, I FORGOT about Mothers Against Violent Videogames
[0:36:50] <pennykettle_> Remember the people on youtube who would write long comments announcing they are no longer going to subscribe
[0:36:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @spaceitaly ok pat
[0:37:01] <%TheTyper> Also, it's a bit insane to try to engage politics with a "public figure" through social media. What good would that do?
[0:37:01] <%Juriasu> shitty person wants to broadcast their shitty opinions in shitty ways
[0:37:07] <%ggbhtg> Not looking for a discussion, I'd say
[0:37:09] <+anoldtoilet> @spaceitaly LUL
[0:37:10] <Chatterbox1991> Also how much of a flex is it to dump on a twitch streamer over Gaza?
[0:37:13] <ToxInjection> They were trying to put you on the spot, yeah
[0:37:17] <LlewynMarie> they just want to fight, and they don't want to grow or learn anything from the other side of things
[0:37:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:37:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @kyh9 someone was trying to shame woolie for comments on podcast 2 weeks ago over Gaza
[0:37:18] <teefpal> This is why I'm a neo-bundist
[0:37:19] <heartlesshealer> @kyh9 they got a nationalist donation saying "sorry but podcast topic reasons mean I will stop support"
[0:37:20] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Imagine trying to get a hot take from WOOLIE on the Israel-Palestine situation. Clowns.
[0:37:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> or good chance he doesn't actually care @WoolieVersus
[0:37:27] <diegobandzz> It’s free money essentially
[0:37:29] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> why would you have a conversation when you can go to people you already agree with!
[0:37:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> and is donating like an idiot
[0:37:30] <ingman112> Woolie how dare you flaunt your anti-Semitism, I’m unsubscribing from superbunnyhop
[0:37:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> @DatAsuna A'ight. I'll give 'em a look-see
[0:37:40] <pennykettle_> @ingman112 LUL
[0:37:44] <tattleworm> having that conversation is how you get corbyn'd
[0:37:44] <niddron> @mechslayer71 guy wasn't "happy" about their takes on Israel actiins
[0:37:48] <%ggbhtg> "nope it's black and white" - woolieONEGUY
[0:37:50] <Blank9> someone passed conceptualization on critical race theory
[0:37:55] <lonosis47> Why wont woolie respond to it though.
[0:37:57] <DatAsuna> I generally give the benefit of the doubt that people feel that way, but many are conditioned to jump to it immediately as a deflective defense mechanism, happens with a few groups and topics.
[0:38:03] <horsesaredumb> I really hope ZA/UM explores the themes of colonialism and ethnic cleansing
[0:38:06] <%Necnill> @tattleworm too real
[0:38:07] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  welcome to the public discorse over Israel/Palistine for the past 30 years
[0:38:07] <+teholsblanket> That's a very cool headband!
[0:38:14] <+allups> play the crab fishing theme song
[0:38:26] <leith_aziz> Guys, as a non-native english speaker, what does "antisemetic" mean?
[0:38:28] <@Menitta> I cant believe Woolie supports Racist Netcode
[0:38:29] <+anoldtoilet> wtfDankerZ
[0:38:40] <+glgzephyr> @lonosis47 What, the shitty donation? He *did* respond to it!
[0:38:44] <primaryfire> crazy how nothing fixes your posture like back painb
[0:38:45] <horsesaredumb> @leith_aziz anti Jewish people specifically
[0:38:47] <spaceitaly> @leith_aziz like racist but for jews
[0:38:50] <%Nekros4442> @leith_aziz racist to jewish people
[0:38:50] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz You can google it to find out. Not hard.
[0:38:50] <iacus_> @leith_aziz against the people called Jews
[0:38:51] <niddron> @leith_aziz anti semetic is basically yew hate
[0:38:54] <Asuterisuku> CAD, for example.
[0:38:55] <%ggbhtg> @menitta sheeeeesh
[0:38:56] <coreybom> @leith_aziz bigotry against jewish people.
[0:38:56] <%TheTyper> Oh good, Twitch got their MONEY PROBLEM sorted ;)

[0:44:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:44:20] <leith_aziz> I'm an Arab, but I feel like i'm really confused here cause im missing context
[0:44:21] <+glgzephyr> @anoldtoilet He clearly wants to get this off his chest, listen to him speak
[0:44:27] <%Vigonept> both sides can be wrong lol
[0:44:30] <leith_aziz> This is about the war with Isreail, right?
[0:44:34] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[0:44:37] <bebopdedop281> NO NUANCES ALLOWED IT'S 2021
[0:44:40] <%OblivionSword1> Can we just not have War
[0:44:42] <%bread_assassin> Civilians shouldn't pay for the crimes of the government.
[0:44:44] <DatAsuna> @leith_aziz don't worry the guy complaining missed even more context.
[0:44:46] <%kyh9> "My country right or wrong; to stand by it when it's right, to fix it when it's wrong" Go fix your "homeland" from these ultra orthodox shitheads
[0:44:49] <diegobandzz> No but pick a side woolie
[0:44:51] <derap41> What's Twitchs TOS on this conflict ?
[0:44:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @bread_assassin THIS
[0:44:52] <Blank9> if people took students hostage in a school, and the police responded by blowing up the school with the hostages in it, you could absolutely be mad at the police
[0:45:00] <primaryfire> your only point that could have been disagreeable is that you can understand why some might try to fight back when they live in an open air prison
[0:45:03] <zanzibarian_hamster> Hate to be that guy, but this is a hell of a conversation to tune in on lol
[0:45:03] <Chatterbox1991> No one is going to pretend that there's bad people on the palistinian side, that doesn't justify what the IDF is doing
[0:45:05] <iacus_> boring centrist response
[0:45:06] <diegobandzz> That’s pretty much what is going on
[0:45:06] <horsesaredumb> @leith_aziz there's a lot to read so take your time with it, no summary is sufficient for the history of the conflict (the morality is mostly simple)
[0:45:06] <srv4254> SO DISCO HUH
[0:45:09] <+meniscate> no politicz in my vidya!!
[0:45:10] <Chatterbox1991> not bad people

[0:45:16] <teefpal> Palestine is literally being genocided, tho
[0:45:21] <%Vigonept> evil apes
[0:45:22] <derap41> hey at least you  get a 10 hours notice
[0:45:25] <pennykettle_> I don't touch the Israel Palestine stuff. I've grown up hearing that conflict as THE tough conflict to address. It sets off a little alarm in my head when I see people online say that Palestine is obviously in the right. I feel like I don't have the info
[0:45:28] <alcmo> israel is in the wrong, israel is always in the wrong, free palestine
[0:45:28] <+Bobbledygook> This is not the comeback I was expecting, nor wanted
[0:45:30] <%OblivionSword1> THE EVIL APES
[0:45:32] <+glgzephyr> @srv4254 This conversation is more Disco Elysium than anything else so far
[0:45:33] <+mechslayer71> Looks like someone fell for the Birthright trip propaganda
[0:45:33] <+anoldtoilet> the more he says the more people will take what he says out of context and then disingenuously call him a terrorist supporter. no matter what he says. if woolie says anything but fully pro colonial zionism hes going to get framed as a Problem
[0:45:41] <Equirah> Woolie you're too naive
[0:45:41] <heemwizard> ooh we're finally bad
[0:45:43] <heemwizard> back
[0:45:44] <Blank9> 10 hour notice for them making you homeless
[0:45:51] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  don't forget the IDF making a meme out of blowing up that apartment full of innocent people
[0:45:53] <teefpal> Israel is the aggressor, from the beginning
[0:45:54] <jorniev> only one side is losing an execive number of civilians
[0:45:54] <Blank9> in a warzone
[0:45:56] <kikoeru_san> Israel is just a fucking colony state fuck them
[0:46:00] <depressioncherrie> let's see what/if a potentially new government without Netanyahu is going to change
[0:46:02] <leith_aziz> Whatever the governemt says, trust me when I say that religion does not justify these actions and Muslims and Jews do NOT stand behind some of those actions
[0:46:10] <+illusiveSaint> hamas is like if you have the mafia in your hood and imagine if your 'govt' just bombs your home instead of investigating
[0:46:10] <+KingGilbertIV> Israel is a colonial project, full stop
[0:46:11] <heartlesshealer> For anyone not in the know, Israel even controls the freshwater situation and who's allowed to use what roads. It's a big oof
[0:46:16] <%phd_in_thuggery> I'm so out of touch on all of this shit
[0:46:19] <diegobandzz> Not to mention American support👍🏾
[0:46:20] <dds333a> @anoldtoilet I agree, he shouldn't bother addressing chat at several times, or this.
[0:46:24] <primaryfire> there's a reason we don't hear palestinians in here giving us their perspective. they can't.
[0:46:24] <%thetunnelhomer> thetunnelhomer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Well, this is a great start for a super political game. Hope you guys try to have fun with it, and take care of your backs.
[0:46:27] <%OblivionSword1> @leith_aziz PREACH BROTHER
[0:46:27] <jorniev> THEY blew up their only covid testing site
[0:46:30] <horsesaredumb> @heartlesshealer specifically in Gaza I think
[0:46:35] <leith_aziz> Usually, the government tends to act without the community's say, which paints a bad picture of Middl-easter people
[0:46:36] <CappuccinoGuil> "I will shoot a child in the head if they throw a rock at me" IDF soldiers
[0:46:49] <leith_aziz> Which kinda sucks if you're an Arab or a Jew
[0:46:51] <+MightyDuckShoes> You only need to see the IDF twitter page to see they are just mask off evil.
[0:46:51] <niddron> yeah high functioning officials did say those things
[0:46:53] <tattleworm> IDF soldiers blew kids away for flying a kite
[0:47:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Woolie the more you talk about this the more you'll get targeted by groups who fund programs to send messages like this,
[0:47:03] <LeeleeBB> "elected" is a strong word lol
[0:47:04] <+anoldtoilet> IDF t shirts with the crosshairs on a cartoon of a pregnant woman with "1 shot 2 kills" on the shirt
[0:47:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> I've seen it before
[0:47:15] <horsesaredumb> @CappuccinoGuil "i will break into a home at 3am and look for any excuse to kill a family" - IDF soldiers
[0:47:18] <kikoeru_san> I hope you're happy one guy that caused this, you're getting dunked on by this whole chat
[0:47:22] <primaryfire> those IDF videos about selling captive women sure are cool
[0:47:24] <+EternalJedi> if it's naive to think that people should just stop being assholes than I'd rather be naive '-')
[0:47:27] <Equirah> Not "naive" in defence of IDF
[0:47:28] <pennykettle_> Canada in the news with those mass child graves this week
[0:47:31] <LlewynMarie> there's loss on both sides, but no one can ignore that there's a power imbalance in all of this. We also can't forget how this most recent round of fighting got started.
[0:47:36] <DatAsuna> He's just calling you naivee to handwave away anything that isn't his puddledeep worldview of "my perspective defines everything"
[0:47:45] <dds333a> @eternaljedi were it that simple
[0:47:49] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer Yeah, that's what I meant, sorry I left out the place name
[0:47:51] <leith_aziz> NotLikeThis
[0:47:54] <teefpal> Israeli military is training US police to kill minorities
[0:47:56] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> thank goodness it's not thousands, but only low hundreds
[0:47:58] <+glgzephyr> there's no justifying what Israel is doing to innocents. No amount of Hamas terrorism can justify it
[0:48:04] <horsesaredumb> @pennykettle_ The indigenous children that were ripped from their family into church schools?
[0:48:08] <primaryfire> gaza is an open-air prison
[0:48:13] <+EternalJedi> dds333a to be frank, it really is, the trick is that everybody needs to agree
[0:48:15] <DatAsuna> It is in fact possible to condemn multiple groups at once
[0:48:16] <%Seancicle> 🤚🏻
[0:48:22] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> now, displaced and traumatized, that's tens-of-thousands
[0:48:23] <+glgzephyr> @teefpal Bro US police was doing that before Israel existed
[0:48:28] <+anoldtoilet> @teefpal literally the chauvin knee on the neck is part of those courses
[0:48:29] <pennykettle_> @pennykettle_ yep
[0:48:30] <%X2Eliah> Man what the f*** is going on in this chat room rn. Didsomeone post a link to here on their twitter bubbles or something?
[0:48:31] <dds333a> @eternaljedi so, it's not simple at all
[0:48:37] <teefpal> @primaryfire true, I'm Jewish and what's happening to gaza is genocide
[0:48:47] <DatAsuna> England has the church of england, we are now all christians. It is decided
[0:48:50] <jorniev> they are still arresting Palestinian people over there
[0:48:52] <%specters_art88> Thank you Woolie.
[0:48:52] <gunsrlove> The problem with these topics is that they always escalate into something else and then opinions start flying everywhere
[0:48:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @glgzephyr yeah, but there are departments that are literally sending recruits to isreal to learn from the IDF
[0:48:56] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  it's like saying Quebec should be held accountable based on what the French Government is doing right now with Muslums for exanple
[0:48:58] <%wibbwobbler> Rhetoric sympathetic toward Palestine is not a bad thing on its own.
[0:49:02] <%MrAtheGreat> Preach Woolie
[0:49:09] <derap41> Its a race to the bottom here
[0:49:10] <+anoldtoilet> ^
[0:49:18] <dukenux> Hamas and Likud fuel each other
[0:49:26] <teefpal> @glgzephyr The training is the issue here, it's where the knee-on-the-neck and illegal chokeholds came from
[0:49:27] <primaryfire> @teefpal 🙏 I was happy to see news about the protests against netanyahu's actions in israel
[0:49:34] <+illusiveSaint> you'd be surprised how much propaganda israel pumps out to justify oppressive actions
[0:49:38] <leith_aziz> Aren't the Hamas the group of people that tried to remove people who were "living in their grounds"?
[0:49:43] <+anoldtoilet> like, literally, just stop shooting women and children and bombing hospitals and news buildings
[0:49:47] <%SirGO0SE> man Woolie consistently just fucking gets it. I wish he understood video games this well :)

[0:50:42] <%phd_in_thuggery> I feel so dumb for accidentally sending my sub message before the stream loaded for me NotLikeThis
[0:50:42] <coreybom> A problem nowadays is that the way internet is, you have to choose one side and one side only. Instead of having of nuance while also being able to recognize when one part is the real biggest issue.
[0:50:43] <Equirah> @DatAsuna not really, i said naive because there's more to hammas retaliatory strikes than just "they're killing too". You had very violent occupations going on for a week already at that point
[0:50:43] <%kyh9> There's a really funny piece of propaganda the IDF put out to suggest that they're some sort of super rock monster who just lets a boulder run over a small town out of spite
[0:50:45] <+anoldtoilet> yeah theres no equal response at all.
[0:50:49] <CuttleCrow> no other country can do anything in the UN if the US is protecting Israel

[0:50:57] <Trace_Bovier> I not sure of it because my understanding is low. but woolie is very genuin in explaining how he sees things
[0:50:58] <Asuterisuku> @Arnoldoaad1 This though.
[0:51:02] <+anoldtoilet> its just being used as an excuse to take territory and murder civilians its awful stuff.
[0:51:05] <%KetsuoTaberu> Cheer500 Glad you're feeling better this week. Yesterday's podcast episode was incredible, and looking forward to how things do today in Disco!
[0:51:09] <derap41> Woolie being a Moralist again
[0:51:13] <%MrAtheGreat> If your defense is "but we HAVE to blow up the children", you're a straight up villain.
[0:51:14] <leith_aziz> Fuck, this is getting depressing...
[0:51:15] <horsesaredumb> @glgzephyr its the Netenyahu family tradition from his grandfather and father both of which brought him and his brother up that way and now he is a war criminal
[0:51:17] <favadem> a well-balanced take on my disco elysium stream?

[0:51:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> Mossad agents don't work in good faith
[0:51:40] <%specters_art88> You’re right Woolie. Saying criticism of Israel equals antisemitism are just trying to avoid any criticism.
[0:51:42] <pennykettle_> @pennykettle_ You got me, I am actually doing the moralist questline
[0:51:43] <+illusiveSaint> its common sense, not at all naive. conflict is always complicated but sometimes the proof is just in the pudding
[0:51:44] <teefpal> @livlinn This happens all the time
[0:51:50] <asleepaura> based Woolie
[0:51:52] <%phd_in_thuggery> Woolie, is real
[0:51:53] <+MightyDuckShoes> Netenyahu is a Holocaust Revisionist too.
[0:51:56] <%ggbhtg> Woolie does exist, can confirm, is real

[0:52:05] <%ggbhtg> Quite real
[0:52:09] <DatAsuna> You cannot accuse woolie of underthinking it
[0:52:10] <%livlinn> @teefpal just terrible...
[0:52:11] <Trace_Bovier> but are birds real?
[0:52:13] <%Vigonept> yeah woolie
[0:52:18] <%alpharius88> "sorry woolie" (as sorry cop)
[0:52:19] <+Jiggisnipe> watch the Woolie video on the channel :)
[0:52:21] <pennykettle_> I respect the fuck out of y'all after you've gotten a bit more open about political stuff. I think it happened around a year ago when the blm protests started
[0:52:28] <iacus_> Some people still fail to get it even with overexplaing, sadly
[0:52:39] <teefpal> @Trace_Bovier no, you absolute fool, you sheep,
[0:52:43] <%OblivionSword1> This needs to be a highlight on the channel
[0:52:46] <%xcompleasedad> @WoolieVersus I more meant the whole "I'm gonna get Woolie to put his foot in his mouth for funsies!" angle than anything else.
[0:52:54] <derap41> This Land Is Mine
[0:52:55] <ingman112> I think this is why Pat and Woolie generally work so well together, because it’s both extremes meeting in the middle. Over explaining vs. fuck you get outta here
[0:53:00] <+anoldtoilet> @MightyDuckShoes the israeli right wing draws a historical line back to terror groups like Irgun and Lehi, who literally tried to ally with Mussolini, and even tried to ally with Hitler during the holocaust. they are fundamentally not actually pro-jewish
[0:53:00] <%Irridium> Irridium subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Holy shit I've been subbed for two years. I regret nothing y'all are great keep on keeping on.
[0:53:01] <Asuterisuku> Woolie looks good with a beard.
[0:53:01] <leith_aziz> People probably have no good answer, which is why they'd rather put a pin on the conversation
[0:53:06] <+anoldtoilet> like, look up what happened to Folke Bernadotte
[0:53:08] <spaceitaly> if you disagree, PLEASE keeping sending woolie money to tell him he's wrong, that'll show him!
[0:53:08] <%Deft_Thought> Belief generally doesn't get shaved down by factual information
[0:53:09] <dds333a> Even back on the channel,,they broached politics at times.
[0:53:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> @teefpal  Netenyahu believes Hitler wasn't going to exterminate the jews, until the Arabs told him to do it... Yeah. Like he has twisted around to making the Palestinians the real orchestrators.
[0:53:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> Can't really fake a video of a dude stealing a home

[0:53:22] <teefpal> Oh god Lehi, such a horrible cursed person
[0:53:24] <%kyh9> It REALLY doesn't matter who started it.  All that matters is Israel DOESNT need to be shooting missiles at civilian homes.  They really don't need to do it to protect themselves even
[0:53:29] <%OblivionSword1> This whole discussion should be on the YouTube channel
[0:53:30] <Belakitu> Preach
[0:53:33] <teefpal> @MightyDuckShoes No, NO that can't be true
[0:53:38] <teefpal> that's insane
[0:53:45] <%livlinn> Woolie being a ray of hope as based gamer
[0:53:45] <tattleworm> most palestinian "missiles" are made from scavenged materials from IDF attacks, that sums up the power imbalance real well

[0:53:55] <CuttleCrow> military service is also mandatory in Israel
[0:53:57] <Belakitu> Frame 1 your on the wrong path
[0:54:03] <+glgzephyr> @tattleworm Are you a worm reference
[0:54:04] <%MrAtheGreat> there's a video made by a YouTube channel called Some More News that covers the conflict in more detail than other places if anyone is interested.

[0:57:05] <%MrAtheGreat> Real Estate is fucked. It's double prices.
[0:57:10] <skyentombment> @ggbhtg I knew about it, but did that just mutate into woolie not existing?

[0:57:35] <ingman112> @woolieversus The best thing about that “say one of these things about...” Disco interaction? If your volition is high enough, you don’t have to. You can just back off. Wonder what that implies
[0:57:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> RYAN ISNT REAL
[0:57:38] <%Irridium> that reminds me I should download virtua fighter
[0:57:41] <teefpal> It's like "yeah that shit is great"

[0:58:58] <horsesaredumb> @ingman112 wait youre right
[0:59:03] <die_hardman> Audio is weird. Sounds lowered
[0:59:04] <+illusiveSaint> [Rhetoric: Medium - Success]
[0:59:06] <horsesaredumb> why is the music like this chat
[0:59:08] <%livlinn> shiaLUL
[0:59:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @TheTyper For real, channel points for getting the streamer to self-care are legit awesome
[0:59:13] <teefpal> @MightyDuckShoes But we were just talking about it

[0:59:33] <+glgzephyr> @die_hardman Game audio on Woolie's streams is always lower than it should be. It's just a thing he does.

[1:00:49] <die_hardman> @vavilonica he should do the moralist one. It is the best one imo
[1:01:09] <+glgzephyr> man the moralist quest fucking goes places I did not expect. Shit's wild.
[1:01:10] <ronin19xx> All good, full Reg
[1:01:13] <%samazonsky> Euuugh I hate the audio part of streaming so much
[1:01:20] <unthought> Probably the Pale
[1:01:28] <hit2key> Just realized how much the facecam reminds me of the player and Kim’s portraits in the game
[1:01:31] <derap41> Woolie is getting his excesrise in at least
[1:01:35] <+glgzephyr> definitely Pale interference
[1:01:38] <+Stormiercashew> audio management is literal wizardry
[1:01:42] <+Juriasu> we listened to the past monkaS
[1:01:46] <niddron> you'd think technology would make this fairly painless
[1:01:49] <%khalcipher> still
[1:01:50] <%BisoromiBear> the ghost of kotor
[1:01:50] <%samazonsky> I feel like I need a new colored cable for each device.
[1:01:51] <niddron> still there
[1:01:51] <derap41> still there
[1:01:52] <%Vigonept> still eh
[1:01:54] <Fuji808> Clicking audio
[1:01:54] <DatAsuna> worse even
[1:01:55] <vavilonica> @die_hardman I went on the fascism one and liked it. It was funny, sad and weirdly profound in an interesting way
[1:01:57] <baron_of_salt> Have you tried setting it to Wumbo?
[1:02:00] <spaceitaly> the biocurse has spread from woolie's spine to the audio cable
[1:02:01] <%Juriasu> maybe just restart the game?
[1:02:03] <%samazonsky> No worries Woolz
[1:02:05] <jorniev> I need to learn audio streaming thing
[1:02:17] <+Reverend_Roscoe> AHHH
[1:02:19] <+glgzephyr> @vavilonica is it possible to be fascist and keep Kim?
[1:02:21] <+Reverend_Roscoe> MY EARS
[1:02:23] <jorniev> still fucky
[1:02:25] <die_hardman> @vavilonica that one was surprisingly insightful
[1:02:31] <%X2Eliah> Wagyu Beef
[1:02:41] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[1:02:50] <ronin19xx> So, hows everyone doing?
[1:02:51] <%phd_in_thuggery> how many games can you stream in the dead ends
[1:02:54] <vavilonica> @glgzephyr absolutely. in fact he is crucial to the fascism exclusive quest
[1:03:11] <+glgzephyr> @vavilonica I guess I'll make that my third playthrough then
[1:03:13] <%samazonsky> Does sounds like something with the audio itself.
[1:03:17] <ronin19xx> Not the game thats for sure
[1:03:18] <+allups> loose cable?
[1:03:20] <%MrAtheGreat> What's going on?
[1:03:21] <teefpal> wow, didn't know kim was fine with fascism
[1:03:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> audio is a nightmare, it's never good
[1:03:31] <ingman112> Loose cable? Or hard reset
[1:03:33] <%X2Eliah> Burned out the audio interface to the mixer?
[1:03:34] <jorniev> so is the racism quest actually depressing like I heard?
[1:03:46] <jorniev> *facisn
[1:03:47] <%X2Eliah> Try another game
[1:03:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Every time I have to do anything with digital audio I hate it
[1:03:51] <DSD24> Hi Woolie! hope you are feeling better
[1:03:54] <DSD24> Hi guys
[1:03:54] <%samazonsky> I like that color bandana.
[1:04:01] <%samazonsky> That seems alright
[1:04:09] <%X2Eliah> Mm its kinda choppy
[1:04:09] <+glgzephyr> no it's there too
[1:04:11] <%samazonsky> ??
[1:04:11] <%TheTyper> Sounds like the windows audio driver
[1:04:12] <vavilonica> @teefpal fascism quest isn't really about fascism, which is the point
[1:04:16] <DatAsuna> sounds like you found it
[1:04:17] <%TheTyper> Sometimes disabling and re-enabling it fixes that
[1:04:21] <%samazonsky> I'll stop, I barely know audio
[1:04:26] <baron_of_salt> Cheer him on Reggie!
[1:04:27] <%samazonsky> Eugh

[1:04:42] <derap41> @vavilonica I mean none of the ideology quests are about ideology

[1:05:26] <%samazonsky> Same
[1:05:28] <%Juriasu> same lol
[1:05:30] <%SirGO0SE> I think the sound design on Haikyuu is really well done
[1:05:35] <%AbnormalVoid> yup LUL
[1:05:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:05:40] <%SirGO0SE> they make impacts sound great
[1:05:43] <unthought> high pitched noise there?
[1:05:44] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I shouldn't relate to that but I do, just late 20s man it's not fair
[1:05:44] <ToxInjection> Wish I cared about sports anime. They look dope.

[1:05:58] <diegobandzz> Yo Reggie you’ve been up on that jjk manga???
[1:05:59] <%TheTyper> They can see you tear up. Be vulnerable ;)
[1:06:03] <%akajaybay> Watching Space Brothers at the moment
[1:06:05] <+Stormiercashew> bro I used to never cry during shows and films but as I'm getting older shit hits different
[1:06:05] <%X2Eliah> Have a big team sex party afterwards
[1:06:09] <+mechslayer71> Weak Reggie, W E A K
[1:06:17] <%samazonsky> Sports Movies need to make a comeback.
[1:06:30] <SivSarcast> For me, tournament arcs in high school anime suck, but when they do it well, that becomes a highlight of that series.
[1:06:31] <%xeromage> xeromage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Woolie Vs Hardware! What else you been watching?
[1:06:32] <ingman112> Even as someone who’s never been into sports anime or even sports, I fucking love Haikyuu
[1:06:35] <%phd_in_thuggery> I'm still waiting on that Yuri on Ice movie
[1:06:36] <%samazonsky> Hearing you
[1:06:38] <%X2Eliah> Sports movies where a Dog does a human sport need a comeback
[1:06:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think part of it is, as you get older you can relate to more things because you have more life experience
[1:06:42] <SivSarcast> Not sure bout pure sports anime tho
[1:06:44] <Oxybe> A new Mighty Ducks movie.
[1:06:50] <+glgzephyr> sbfpUno

[1:07:00] <DSD24> That's the noise
[1:07:00] <%samazonsky> Mighty Ducks reboot gotta be in the works
[1:07:00] <die_hardman> @konarius I don’t really understand the fascist quest. How is Harry mentally after it?
[1:07:02] <%akajaybay> that sounded ok

[1:15:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie has literally every single ideology thought
[1:15:17] <%OblivionSword1> Talk to measurehead to get the body down

[1:16:02] <heemwizard> yeah
[1:16:02] <%doomerskeletor13> He said you can talk to Measurehead to get the body down too
[1:16:06] <heysamuel> i think it's in items
[1:16:06] <pennykettle_> in Items
[1:16:11] <%OblivionSword1> should be under items
[1:16:29] <vavilonica> been thinking a lot about this skill system, so many ways game developmers could add on and utilize this idea

[1:17:32] <pennykettle_> oh noo thats so low. My rhetoric was my main stat
[1:17:45] <%OblivionSword1> why not try
[1:17:45] <%doomerskeletor13> The magic container
[1:17:49] <%OblivionSword1> it's white
[1:17:49] <+Sir_Louis> Sometimes asking nicely works
[1:17:50] <+aartbastiaan> oh well, white stat LUL
[1:17:50] <ingman112> Might as wel
[1:17:51] <%Javaa01> Check your clothes maybe?
[1:17:52] <heemwizard> you can try everyday
[1:17:53] <Indigo_Automaton> It's a hite check
[1:17:56] <CuttleCrow> white check though
[1:18:03] <+temporaryplaceholder> I don't understand how a rhetoric is used to wrench open a container but OK
[1:18:04] <absolute_cagemony> Open Sesame - Rhetoric 100
[1:18:04] <%kyh9> TURN ON TWITCH INTEGRATION
[1:18:05] <unthought> "Container, buddy. I need you to open up to me."
[1:18:05] <pennykettle_> its a rhetoric check not a physical, youre asking it nicely to open
[1:18:05] <%AbnormalVoid> risk then level for two tries
[1:18:06] <%kyh9> LET US HELP YOU
[1:18:08] <Johannen> white check
[1:18:09] <%OblivionSword1> it's a white check so why not try it
[1:18:11] <heemwizard> as long as the harbor is still accesible...
[1:18:12] <ingman112> Hey white checks
[1:18:17] <heemwizard> @kyh9 ping him
[1:18:17] <linSP> There’s always a 1/20 chance to succeed
[1:18:19] <%akajaybay> if you try and fail and then get more rhetoric that's two attempts
[1:18:20] <ezera123> still try it
[1:18:22] <+aartbastiaan> white stats reopen if you level that stat
[1:18:23] <Indigo_Automaton> Yes so you might as well try
[1:18:27] <%Josef_Stryker> Or just save-scum woolieSMUG
[1:18:30] <+physicslawyer> Yes.
[1:18:30] <%Javaa01> There's a few ways to unlock white checks
[1:18:31] <derap41> Some conversation can reset it too
[1:18:31] <+illusiveSaint> thats correct you can try again if you level it up
[1:18:31] <%Juriasu> yes
[1:18:34] <%AbnormalVoid> all white checks open back up after their corresponding stat is leveled again
[1:18:36] <%akajaybay> rather than just one chance when you have it higher
[1:18:38] <+aartbastiaan> white checks* I meant
[1:18:39] <%Javaa01> But leveling is the most straight forward
[1:18:40] <ToxInjection> You gotta put one skill point into the relevant akill
[1:18:41] <%kyh9> @WoolieVersus Turn on Twitch Integration: it can let us help you through this stuff
[1:18:42] <+Jeshk0> yes. but certain events will also unlock certain white checks
[1:18:44] <SomeAsianDood> That's the most direct way to reopen a white check
[1:18:44] <%Juriasu> yes correct
[1:18:45] <%akajaybay> specific
[1:18:45] <laserbeaming> only the stat
[1:18:46] <teefpal> you only need to level up the skill
[1:18:48] <+mechslayer71> Or change the conditions on the check via other means @woolieversus
[1:18:48] <iacus_> dice rolls aren't pre-seeded so you can savescum
[1:18:50] <ToxInjection> if you fail the white check that ia
[1:18:51] <AvroEltz> but if youre going to level up rethoric to improve your chance then might aswell try
[1:18:54] <pennykettle_> Some white checks open themselves in unique situations, and some thought cabinets will open a category of white checks
[1:18:57] <Indigo_Automaton> Next level up or certain thoughts can unlock it
[1:18:57] <CuttleCrow> wooliePOYO savescumming
[1:18:59] <%PMAvers> Or if there's some circumstance in the world that resets it.
[1:18:59] <%akajaybay> there are some passive white check resets too
[1:19:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> once you level that skill you can try, sometimes certain actions also open it
[1:19:01] <+glgzephyr> @linSP 1/36, actually. A critical success is two sixes.
[1:19:03] <ingman112> It’s either leveling the specific stat or getting a story bonus of some kind
[1:19:05] <Miklosher> You can refresh the checks either through leveling the specific stat, internalizing a thought or by a specific converstaion
[1:19:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes, it refreshes if you level up that specific stat. It also refreshes if you meet certain requirements
[1:19:08] <derap41> Also getting boosted lets you retry them
[1:19:09] <%holydeviant1> Some thoughts also unlock broad white check categories, as well
[1:19:13] <+mechslayer71> Or change the condition of the check somehow
[1:19:13] <%OblivionSword1> white check can be retried and sometimes some interaction can refresh checks
[1:19:17] <+aartbastiaan> people are saying any +number reopen it
[1:19:17] <flyingmulita> some reset the next day or with dialogue
[1:19:23] <+glgzephyr> leveling up skills is not the only thing that refreshes white checks
[1:19:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:24] <%Arnoldoaad1> you can try, then if you fail leveling up rethoric reopens it
[1:19:29] <laserbeaming> getting pluses refreshes the thing
[1:19:31] <%holydeviant1> In short: A lot of stuff can unlock white checks
[1:19:33] <Deasmeister> Check if you have clothes
[1:19:34] <%X2Eliah> a skiped try is a wasted try
[1:19:37] <pennykettle_> pray
[1:19:38] <CuttleCrow> white checks are very safe
[1:19:40] <+mechslayer71> Half light one, oof
[1:19:42] <+illusiveSaint> you can come back if you get more bonuses
[1:19:45] <konarius> it is not like you can see what's inside it :P
[1:19:46] <+glgzephyr> damn 8% isn't bad for this check at this point
[1:19:58] <+Jeshk0> you -1 rhetoric rn
[1:20:00] <derap41> Yeah and volition also let you do it again
[1:20:04] <unthought> I believe it can also unlock if something happens in the world that improves the odds.
[1:20:04] <%SirGO0SE> yeah didnt Pat pass this with a low %
[1:20:05] <laserbeaming> you have -1 Rhetoric on the hobo hat
[1:20:05] <Elf_Planator> on the left it says
[1:20:10] <%PMAvers> Well, something you're wearing is giving a -1 to Rhetoric
[1:20:12] <%X2Eliah> lol read the bonus list
[1:20:15] <AvroEltz> YES
[1:20:15] <derap41> Hat
[1:20:15] <+glgzephyr> it's right there....
[1:20:18] <%doomerskeletor13> One of your current clothes is lowering it
[1:20:18] <%OblivionSword1> minus 11
[1:20:22] <%OblivionSword1> 1
[1:20:22] <Indigo_Automaton> Take hat off
[1:20:33] <+glgzephyr> people don't respect the beanie
[1:20:33] <%SirGO0SE> THATS GOOD
[1:20:34] <pennykettle_> Pray boys
[1:20:36] <unthought> Your hat is making it harder to talk to an inanimate object.
[1:20:37] <SomeAsianDood> hobo hat makes u seem crazy
[1:20:39] <Broand> Getting clues, leveling stats and some special actions/thoughts will unlock white checks. Make sure to dress for a check before you try it though

[1:21:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Haha
[1:21:14] <pennykettle_> This playthrough is really reliant on random rolls for content

[1:21:17] <%OblivionSword1> maybe next time

[1:21:45] <%SainEdge> LUL
[1:21:45] <+glgzephyr> @pennykettle_ That's just how the video game works. If you realistically want to see everything, multiple playthroughs are required
[1:21:50] <Louie_Salmon> MOBA movement

[1:22:19] <unthought> Do you need to talk to measurehead? See if he's humble?
[1:22:20] <ingman112> For the body to go down you have to talk to measurehead
[1:22:24] <MrPedrovsky> Oh shit slept through the start of the stream. What i miss?

[1:57:58] <laserbeaming> 1
[1:57:59] <Indigo_Automaton> 1 first
[1:58:00] <%OblivionSword1> 1 first
[1:58:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 1
[1:58:03] <%MrAtheGreat> 1
[1:58:03] <CuttleCrow> 1
[1:58:04] <pennykettle_> its both
[1:58:04] <laserbeaming> doesn't lock you
[1:58:04] <Picia000123> 111
[1:58:05] <Miklosher> 1 first wont lock
[1:58:05] <gunsrlove> Thank you game, for stating the obvious finally
[1:58:07] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s both
[1:58:17] <%Deft_Thought> I like that Cuno
[1:58:20] <Louie_Salmon> Prompts with questions will basically never advance the tree
[1:58:24] <DatAsuna> now set her free
[1:58:25] <derap41> SET ME FREE!
[1:58:27] <pennykettle_> Wow I think I did that check the first day
[1:58:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Yup!
[1:58:30] <+illusiveSaint> wait did he pass the emp check??
[1:58:35] <%Javaa01> Girls are in fact watching
[1:58:36] <pennykettle_> yes @illusiveSaint
[1:58:37] <%Deft_Thought> Cuno's out here throwing his hands up like "Come at me"
[1:58:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @illusivesaint si senor
[1:58:40] <nukle0nik> he passed it, now to see if he bungles it
[1:58:40] <%MrAtheGreat> Woolie actually said as much during his first meeting with them. It was a real good call.
[1:58:42] <unthought> If it's not in quotation marks, you're not saying it out loud.
[1:58:43] <heartlesshealer> that kotor 2 council shit
[1:59:02] <ingman112> 100 percent
[1:59:05] <iacus_> wow
[1:59:06] <+aartbastiaan> Cuno has a +5 to everything because girls are watching
[1:59:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @unthought hmmmm good notice, I didn't realize that till now
[1:59:13] <gunsrlove> When you pulled the gun, she was brave and stand off-ish, and she is constantly urging Cuno on, he is just a mouthpiece
[1:59:19] <pennykettle_> I love Cuno's portrait but his model truly portrays his drugged up kid face
[1:59:25] <jorniev> CAREFUL HERE
[1:59:34] <derap41> @pennykettle_ Cuno is Half Light
[1:59:34] <%OblivionSword1> I knew a lot of those type of people back in school
[1:59:35] <%Deft_Thought> I've known plenty of the opposite folks too: chill in a group but straight up creeps solo.
[1:59:42] <nukle0nik> snoop dooooogg
[1:59:46] <gunsrlove> Murda was da case
[1:59:48] <pennykettle_> DAMAGED
[1:59:50] <ToxInjection> The PSY checks are fun
[1:59:55] <%MrAtheGreat> Yeah Empathy's pretty cool\
[2:00:00] <Blank9> PSY rules
[2:00:03] <pennykettle_> Cuno Thesis
[2:00:04] <laserbeaming> Empathy is a great stat
[2:00:05] <DSD24> Cuno is this games Chao's Hero
[2:00:12] <ToxInjection> Still need to do my second run with PHY and Motorics
[2:00:13] <%doomerskeletor13> I love Cuno
[2:00:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Woolie this game treats DRUGS and ALCOHOL differently,  Harry Is uniquely effected by alcohol and its badd for him, drugs can be really helpful....with some downsides!
[2:00:17] <Indigo_Automaton> Empathy was my specialty ski;;
[2:00:31] <+Bitscreed> Empathy leads to some really great moments in this game. Not hugely important ones necessarily but they really hit home with me personally.
[2:00:34] <derap41> Empathy  good for social workers and Sociopaths
[2:00:40] <%MrAtheGreat> YO
[2:00:41] <heemwizard> dont fuck this up

[2:04:47] <%MrAtheGreat> Maybe that check was there for a reason
[2:04:52] <%kewlmyc> @zanzibarian_hamster More like she likes listening to people die over the radio
[2:04:53] <LeeleeBB> snuff radio is referenced in the game, unregulated radio broadcasts where ppl are murdered. For those in chat unaware
[2:05:09] <drunken_lemur> GOBLIN CHILD!
[2:05:10] <Johannen> Woolie acknowledged the "shoot the kid' plot is part of our universe
[2:05:14] <%MrAtheGreat> I wouldn't be surprised if you get a check increase if you hear this first before getting the option
[2:05:23] <+Jiggisnipe> oh
[2:05:24] <Asuterisuku> Terrified of her repercussions.
[2:05:25] <%wibbwobbler> Cuno!
[2:05:25] <ingman112> “You feel as though it would be dangerous to set this creature free to roam the cosmos.”
[2:05:27] <+aartbastiaan> even Cuno is scared of her
[2:05:32] <drunken_lemur> Days Gone!
[2:05:39] <%kyh9> cunoesse goes HARDER than you imagined
[2:05:45] <pennykettle_> I just read about a girl that convinced other neighborhood kids to help her torture people

[2:06:47] <laserbeaming> Why did you think people love Cuno so much? He's relatable in his own mad way
[2:06:50] <%MrAtheGreat> Even Cuno doesn't see her as a human
[2:06:50] <jorniev> children would not be like this for no reason

[2:21:23] <Louie_Salmon> Cuno solved
[2:21:24] <available_line> [ Kim will remember that ]
[2:21:27] <justcallmebobplease> Kim's points go down for that, don't they?
[2:21:28] <Asuterisuku> The body's down, you should probably look at it.
[2:21:32] <+DrSmashy> KIM GO DOWN
[2:21:33] <flyingmulita> the autopsy gonna take a while
[2:21:33] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I never did much with Cuno, always heard there was a lot, boy were people right, I am gonna do more with him on a Psych run
[2:21:34] <justcallmebobplease> Woolie check your Good Cop / Bad Cop
[2:21:36] <%Vigonept> SHE MEANS IT
[2:21:48] <+mechslayer71> And woolie wrote off empathizing with Cuno as a waste of time LUL

[2:22:01] <%MrAtheGreat> How? On those mini planks?
[2:22:02] <unthought> Maybe he jumped
[2:22:02] <Myrkbat> Measurehead probably just reached up
[2:22:15] <jorniev> IT FEELS like woolie doesn't believe his own character when he says he is not going to Doo the drugs
[2:22:16] <%MrAtheGreat> Measurehead may have been able to reach up and swat it down
[2:22:16] <nelsonsaysbooya> measurewang
[2:22:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> I like to think he grabbed his legs and just yanked him
[2:22:20] <+aartbastiaan> this game is way too funny to play like a 100% good cop
[2:22:21] <+mechslayer71> Oh boy, I wonder if woolie can pass THAT check
[2:22:27] <%doomerskeletor13> I think any time after 21:00 will work?
[2:22:33] <CuttleCrow> branch just broke off when it saw Measurehead
[2:22:34] <Miklosher> the corpse theme is SO GOOD
[2:22:36] <nukle0nik> yeah you don't need to be there 21:00 sharp
[2:22:36] <konarius> Kim points are wierd, he will call you racists, but still be buddies because you are damn good cop :P
[2:22:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mechslayer71 doubt it, the stat's too low

[2:23:42] <%MrAtheGreat> Woolie you don't have a gun tho LUL
[2:23:44] <CuttleCrow> super cop
[2:23:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> CSI MIAMI is just Action
[2:23:53] <%OblivionSword1> The gun that you sold
[2:23:53] <Tisaric> The world of Elysium is a little fucky
[2:23:55] <+TheotherKristian> This isn't Earth Woolie
[2:23:55] <pennykettle_> @nukle0nik did you get the special edition one or the affordable one? LUL I couldn't justify paying over double the price for an origami sleeve and colored records
[2:23:57] <ingman112> They train the shit out of their volunteers
[2:24:01] <%MrAtheGreat> You don't even have a badge
[2:24:03] <%Deft_Thought> Just like actual cops (wanna think they are)
[2:24:04] <Dakuu75> I was more into NCIS
[2:24:08] <%SirGO0SE> the CSI Miami guy went to my high school
[2:24:09] <DSD24> NCIS is great
[2:24:11] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I always feel like one of the few who preferred NCIS
[2:24:15] <+gitgouda> ncis yeeees
[2:24:16] <ToxInjection> I was big on CSI too. I blame that on my grandma
[2:24:16] <nukle0nik> @pennykettle_ the affordable one, don't care about the origami case but the picture disks would've been nice... oh well
[2:24:18] <%hax_metatron> This is a citizen's militia that is WAY under-funded, not like Western cops
[2:24:19] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> at least in my circle
[2:24:22] <emptyantics> Dick Wolf shows are a joke
[2:24:23] <konarius> @dukenux they should be able do this preliminary stuff though... if they'd arrived on the scene a week earlier.
[2:24:32] <Chatterbox1991> for Prime Time CSI is super good
[2:24:33] <laserbeaming> The RCM is understaffed, you have to do everything
[2:24:34] <Eger007> it makes sence here because RCM is broke and a singular person has to do a job of 20 people
[2:24:39] <%SirGO0SE> YEAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:24:44] <ToxInjection> "Computer - enhance the image!"
[2:24:46] <jorniev> I feel bad he didn't shoot down the corpse, it's  a really interesting route

[2:26:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> I mean what, is the bloated corpse gonna get an infection? The gloves are for you
[2:27:07] <pennykettle_> I didn't do evrart til DAY 4
[2:27:13] <pennykettle_> I couldnt get in
[2:27:17] <Tisaric> there's thousands of paths to this point
[2:27:18] <%Vigonept> i just shit the body down
[2:27:22] <%MrAtheGreat> oh yeah.
[2:27:23] <%Irridium> you can beat the game without even looking at the body
[2:27:26] <Tisaric> I shot the body down on the 3rd day
[2:27:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I prefer trying to shoot the body down first thing
[2:27:26] <Blank9> you can do things in all sorts of directions
[2:27:28] <Myrkbat> I saw that ledge and HAD to jump it and that leads to Evrart
[2:27:32] <emptyantics> @zanzibarian_hamster tampered dead body is still bad
[2:27:33] <derap41> Its not fun having Everart tell you your gun is gone
[2:27:33] <elshadow7> I got to Evrart on day 3 I think?
[2:27:34] <%OblivionSword1> I got to evrart after i took the body down
[2:27:35] <primaryfire> but you can use the info from evrart for other dialogues
[2:27:38] <ToxInjection> I did Evrart right after doing this stuff, but I did the autopsy on Day 1
[2:27:42] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus It is entirely possible to beat the game without even looking at the body, there's an achievement for it and everything
[2:27:42] <+askalta> i wanted that coat
[2:27:46] <+aartbastiaan> [ENCYCLOPEDIA] Hey chat did you know the capital of Mozambique is Maputo? Well know you know.
[2:27:46] <%Arnoldoaad1> I meet Evrart on day 2 but had already downed the body on day 1
[2:27:50] <ingman112> Everybody goes in a different order
[2:27:54] <plan_Backfire> I did basically everything other than investigate the murder for days really
[2:27:56] <laserbeaming> there's an achievement for completing the game without ever seeing the Body
[2:28:02] <Asuterisuku> Apocalypse Cop!
[2:28:04] <Blank9> every npc gives some new info somehow
[2:28:15] <%MrAtheGreat> You can see Everart almost immediately, or you can never see him. It's why this game's great and why replaying it is such a tempting idea.
[2:28:27] <JetpackMcQuack> thanks logic
[2:28:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> @emptyantics I don't think this is that kind of operation since they don't have coroners and that

[2:51:36] <Asuterisuku> Lizard Brain why
[2:51:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Revolution was like 50 years ago
[2:51:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not always
[2:51:39] <nukle0nik> there's no quote marks so you're not speaking out loud
[2:51:39] <derap41> Sometimes its just in yourhead
[2:51:42] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> that's not out loud, no quotes
[2:51:44] <+Bitscreed> Nah, no "" marks means it's internal
[2:51:44] <laserbeaming> it's not out loud if it's not in quotes
[2:51:44] <primaryfire> you don't say it out loud unless there are quotation marks
[2:51:45] <heemwizard> are you saying this out loud?
[2:51:46] <unthought> No quote marks, no talking out loud.
[2:51:47] <penitentpendant> Things not in quotations are just in your head
[2:51:48] <Deasmeister> No quote marks
[2:51:50] <teefpal> no your just thinking it
[2:51:50] <die_hardman> No
[2:51:53] <iacus_> are you sure its out loud or just taking place in your head?
[2:51:53] <Louie_Salmon> Well, not until there's quotation marks
[2:51:54] <+aartbastiaan> You're just standing there, not much better
[2:51:56] <%Javaa01> It's only saying it out loud when there's quotation marks around the line

[3:11:39] <+anoldtoilet> all the begging for emote more GUARANTEES that something is up, whereas one guy can be easily missed
[3:11:39] <pennykettle_> I prefer the actual LP experience

[3:15:30] <+aartbastiaan> 17% welp
[3:15:32] <%OblivionSword1> that's a very important check
[3:15:38] <%Rakenshin> Oof
[3:15:38] <pennykettle_> oh lord
[3:15:39] <%Vigonept> Clothes! level up!
[3:15:40] <+Ensign_Epic> Reggie Finger it.
[3:15:42] <+Ropcord> 17% is basically 100%
[3:15:43] <die_hardman> TRY IT
[3:15:45] <Asuterisuku> It's a white check.
[3:15:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> DRUGS
[3:15:47] <+illusiveSaint> level it!
[3:15:48] <heemwizard> you need da speed for this
[3:15:48] <%DiscoMatador> you have a couple of points also
[3:15:49] <available_line> Time to level perception.
[3:15:50] <ToxInjection> You can leave and save first if you'd like
[3:15:54] <%LCLSmoothie> drugs
[3:15:54] <FassieFons> clothing up!
[3:15:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Drugs PogChamp
[3:15:57] <Timarkot> Do it then put points into it
[3:15:57] <+pupil31> Let the bodies hit the floor
[3:15:59] <CuttleCrow> get dem boots
[3:16:04] <+mechslayer71> Save scum that shit bruv
[3:16:06] <ingman112> This is worth trying at the very least
[3:16:08] <pennykettle_> There's gotta be a pair of perception glasses
[3:16:10] <+physicslawyer> Do 3.
[3:16:10] <teefpal> Roll a perception check
[3:16:12] <ToxInjection> oh wait it's a white check too
[3:16:13] <Asuterisuku> You DO have a skill point!
[3:16:13] <ezera123> Look at the body
[3:16:14] <heemwizard> level up perception first
[3:16:14] <Trace_Bovier> try then level perception to try again
[3:16:14] <KingOfTheGeats> its a white check so might as well
[3:16:16] <%LCLSmoothie> drugs, clothes or save scum
[3:16:20] <konarius> roll, put point, roll again,
[3:16:20] <%nicversus> Sounds like a good time to level your perception
[3:16:20] <Robot_Nixon_> we need his shoes moon2SNIFF
[3:16:21] <Miklosher> maybe put a point in perception?
[3:16:21] <ezera123> perception
[3:16:23] <laserbeaming> you can buy a Perception Hat from Siileng
[3:16:29] <%LCLSmoothie> they got me for my foams
[3:16:31] <kikoeru_san> hmm Woolie where do you put a dead body to keep it fresh
[3:16:36] <derap41> Try it then level
[3:16:36] <unthought> If I remember correctly, this check is worth failing
[3:16:36] <+anoldtoilet> the checks reset when you put a point in
[3:16:37] <ingman112> Yeah perception’s good to level here
[3:16:37] <elshadow7> You could always pump perception after trying the check
[3:16:39] <+anoldtoilet> so never put the point in first
[3:16:40] <+glgzephyr> try the perception check, then pump it, then pump it again. It's worth it.
[3:16:45] <+anoldtoilet> always after, because it resets
[3:16:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Perception is a super useful stat
[3:16:48] <heemwizard> @laserbeaming i thought he succeeded in the concep check
[3:16:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Push it to 4
[3:16:52] <%OblivionSword1> might as well put it into perrception
[3:16:52] <Trace_Bovier> check and then do level to re unlock it
[3:16:53] <Miklosher> Do the check once before leveling up for two tries!
[3:16:53] <Blank9> yeah, pumping resets the white checks you fail at
[3:17:00] <laserbeaming> @laserbeaming oh, then nvm
[3:17:03] <elshadow7> Perception's a good stat anyway, worth it
[3:17:04] <buffcat> do the 17 check first then add a point for 2 tries
[3:17:06] <pennykettle_> I have no clue how the game goes if you dont get the next few checks
[3:17:06] <%PMAvers> I mean, yeah, there's always a chance of rolling boxcars.
[3:17:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Might as well try it once before you level it
[3:17:08] <available_line> I would be wise to try ti, then level it, then try it, then level it.
[3:17:12] <+Ensign_Epic> Get that level into perception 100%
[3:17:12] <Trace_Bovier> do check than pump
[3:17:15] <%Vigonept> ya get 3 tries if ya level after failing
[3:17:20] <%DiscoMatador> Maybe try it first then bump it if you fail
[3:17:22] <+illusiveSaint> keep playing and go back to the body later
[3:17:27] <Ids560> yo do get 3 tries yeah
[3:17:29] <Trace_Bovier> try first then level
[3:17:29] <ezera123> Do the check then pump
[3:17:32] <Robot_Nixon_> no drugs 😡
[3:17:34] <%OblivionSword1> maybe try it first and then level it up
[3:17:36] <ingman112> Try first then level
[3:17:37] <+glgzephyr> you need motorics up
[3:17:38] <Qpic> @pennykettle_ It gets silly

[3:31:31] <+glgzephyr> UH HUH
[3:31:34] <Iza_kku> it is wild
[3:31:45] <Estwilde> yeah through the mouth while the body is flailing?
[3:31:48] <derap41> Angle matches with him being hanged
[3:31:52] <Indigo_Automaton> Kappa
[3:31:52] <%kyh9> Entered back of head, but body was facing the front
[3:31:53] <dukenux> gun in the mouth
[3:31:53] <+glgzephyr> HOW INDEED
[3:31:55] <justcallmebobplease> You mean 'gun in mouth' position?
[3:31:57] <+aartbastiaan> noscoped
[3:31:57] <%illusiveSaint> @Nullseven Thanks! woolieONEGUY
[3:32:06] <+Bitscreed> Loving Reggie and Woolie's reactions and theorizing here.
[3:32:07] <$TheFabledAble> it would have to be a low caliber from a low angle OR from far enough away that the bullet didnt exit
[3:32:07] <die_hardman> Sex Kappa
[3:32:23] <dukenux> although gun in the mouth with a riffle ammo would prolly have a bigger exit wound?
[3:32:28] <%MrAtheGreat> @Nullseven You good guy friend
[3:32:32] <%MrAtheGreat> MonkaS
[3:32:33] <derap41> 4mm not 9mm
[3:32:33] <+glgzephyr> Wouldn't the gun going off in the mouth do a lot more damage than a .4 cm hole?
[3:32:34] <Myrkbat> NotLikeThis
[3:32:35] <Asuterisuku> That's a dreadful thought.
[3:32:35] <zedravan> NotLikeThis
[3:32:35] <Ids560> he did say it was rifled
[3:32:35] <Iza_kku> i think so
[3:32:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> You weren't here when it happened
[3:32:40] <%kyh9> It COULDNT be your gun.  You only showed up AFTER the guy was dead
[3:32:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rifled, not a rifle
[3:32:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> Rifling makes the bullet spin
[3:32:56] <derap41> @kyh9 Or did he
[3:33:05] <pennykettle_> I cant believe they did all of this before talking to the union guys
[3:33:06] <Robot_Nixon_> @glgzephyr also gunpowder
[3:33:14] <+glgzephyr> @Robot_Nixon_ Exactly my thought
[3:33:15] <%BisoromiBear> not convinced this isn't covering up a choke jerk accident
[3:33:16] <Dakuu75> I had to step out for a bit. Did I miss anything in the last 10 minutes?

[3:40:55] <bebopdedop281> holy fucking shit the y don't stop coming
[3:40:58] <teefpal> Dont feed the trolls
[3:41:00] <heemwizard> we continuing?
[3:41:02] <Iandrasil> oh did I miss the game again?
[3:41:06] <Iandrasil> dammit
[3:41:12] <justcallmebobplease> @Iandrasil Naw we resumin'
[3:41:13] <+Bobbledygook> @Iandrasil Nah just a break
[3:41:20] <jc_chance> Woolie
[3:41:24] <Iandrasil> ah ok
[3:41:26] <+aartbastiaan> TRUE
[3:41:34] <Trace_Bovier> makes sense
[3:41:36] <islandoasis> wait what the hell is going on? I was here for video games
[3:41:38] <+pkoffing> israel's gov is mega rightwing also important to note
[3:41:41] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @teefpal
[3:41:44] <islandoasis> whats the topic?
[3:41:54] <justcallmebobplease> Gaza
[3:42:02] <+aartbastiaan> Completely agree
[3:42:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> game politcs! real politcs! for fun! for glory?
[3:42:19] <derap41> I get what you're getting at but place and time. Guy is already in the wrong for bringing it up here
[3:42:21] <primaryfire> @islandoasis israeli viewers feeling slighted for the way wwoolie and pat discussed the israel-gaza conflict
[3:42:21] <teefpal> Nearly 3,000 Palestinian dead
[3:42:24] <+glgzephyr> civilian casualties are never justifiable
[3:42:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> The Mossad will literally send people to bully you over this in your subs and donations.
[3:42:29] <+aartbastiaan> @teefpal FeelsBadMan
[3:42:32] <%illusiveSaint> idk why people ignore the disproportionate ratio of casualties
[3:42:32] <BlackermanZX> its fucking gross
[3:42:37] <+pkoffing> "mowing the lawn"
[3:42:41] <konarius> Woolie is not defending colonialism, how is this possibleasdfasdf
[3:42:44] <tattleworm> corbyn speedrun any%
[3:42:45] <+aartbastiaan> Amen
[3:42:46] <JetpackMcQuack> That's right
[3:42:47] <DatAsuna> His replies make it clear that he refuses to engage with any of the substance of what you're saying.
[3:42:47] <+mechslayer71> Wait, did someone say some shit AGAIN?
[3:42:55] <die_hardman> It’s reasonable. Israel could do things differently, but I do not know what can realistically happen.
[3:42:56] <%Vigonept> LETS GO STEAL SOME BOOTS
[3:42:56] <%illusiveSaint> did we get another one??
[3:42:57] <+aartbastiaan> @tattleworm the only argument the tories have
[3:43:00] <%krispen_wa> EWW Westworld
[3:43:00] <pennykettle_> Pog
[3:43:00] <linSP> fellas, is it wrong to commit genocide
[3:43:00] <teefpal> @tattleworm LUL
[3:43:11] <islandoasis> back to the washroom
[3:43:12] <pennykettle_> Westworld Season 1 FeelsBadMan
[3:43:13] <chll0ne> who said sumn stupid?
[3:43:19] <%kyh9> Jesus are IDF still going off?
[3:43:28] <teefpal> The show should have ended S2.
[3:43:28] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[3:43:31] <jc_chance> Woolie is anarchistic
[3:43:33] <+Bitscreed> Oh wow!
[3:43:34] <+glgzephyr> oh wow
[3:43:37] <%OblivionSword1> oh cool
[3:43:40] <+aartbastiaan> PogChamp
[3:43:41] <styptysat> PogChamp
[3:43:43] <teefpal> Doesn't look like anything to me.
[3:43:43] <+glgzephyr> lmao
[3:43:44] <Trace_Bovier> that's a cool design
[3:43:49] <azure_rivers> very cool
[3:43:51] <ingman112> This seems like a bad faith argument, or at least one that can’t be done properly in the middle of a stream
[3:43:52] <+Bitscreed> I've only seen season 1 so it's cool to me
[3:43:53] <+glgzephyr> HOW FITTING
[3:43:57] <pennykettle_> Would have been a half decent tattoo if the show didnt go to shit
[3:44:02] <+aartbastiaan> as an AI student I'm so disappointed where that we
[3:44:05] <+aartbastiaan> *went
[3:44:07] <jc_chance> RIP Westworld it’s super trash now
[3:44:14] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[3:44:14] <LeeleeBB> cool coaster
[3:44:14] <justcallmebobplease> CORRECT
[3:44:15] <available_line> @linSP You'd think the people who'd understand that the most should be the people who almost got genocided themselves. I don't understand hoomans sometimes.
[3:44:15] <islandoasis> what happened to westworld?
[3:44:16] <pennykettle_> Kappa
[3:44:16] <+SomeRagamuffin> So mysterious
[3:44:19] <Asuterisuku> Nope, never happened.
[3:44:19] <teefpal> Season 2 is worse but still good Season 3 is absolute garbage
[3:44:19] <Trace_Bovier> what actually happened to west world?
[3:44:19] <Dotados> Exactly
[3:44:20] <+Prevot> LUL
[3:44:22] <derap41> yeah
[3:44:23] <die_hardman> @jc_chance is it still going?
[3:44:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IF ONLY
[3:44:25] <Tisaric> I still can't get over how s2 went
[3:44:29] <Zantetzuken> such a shame
[3:44:30] <%OblivionSword1> oh if only
[3:44:31] <Davimotion96> what a shame...
[3:44:32] <justcallmebobplease> But imagine, Woolie - what if they continued making more seasons and they weren't good!?
[3:44:33] <%krispen_wa> Season 3 is almost GOT S8 levels of bad
[3:44:38] <islandoasis> I remember the later season trailers being all action in some future city
[3:44:39] <iacus_> what show? westworld?
[3:44:40] <WakeUpThrow> They decided to quit while the were ahead, and honestly good for them
[3:44:48] <konarius> Ed Harris was the only reason to watch that show
[3:44:51] <%krispen_wa> Season 2 at least had 2-3 good episodes. Season 3 was all shit
[3:44:53] <%wibbwobbler> Yup lol
[3:44:54] <emptyantics> Is True Detective worth watching?
[3:44:55] <ingman112> Just like game of thrones, and lost, and dexter
[3:44:55] <+Bitscreed> Sir Tony Hopkins was very good tbf
[3:44:55] <chll0ne> LUL
[3:45:01] <spaceitaly> doesn't look like anything to me

[3:45:10] <pennykettle_> Shogunworld LUL
[3:45:11] <chll0ne> no westworld

[3:45:12] <Iandrasil> it's a great anime
[3:45:15] <jc_chance> @die_hardman Season 3 recently dropped and its a hot load of ass
[3:45:15] <Hammatime8> The lore!
[3:45:18] <Asuterisuku> Strive in 10 days!
[3:45:18] <%townzzzzz> sign or rev?
[3:45:24] <Explodincatz> never gunna finish Korra are ya?
[3:45:28] <+pkoffing> peeped WandaVision???
[3:45:33] <derap41> Russian disinformation

[3:45:40] <islandoasis> thoughts on May theme. Go
[3:45:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god not q NotLikeThis
[3:45:42] <Deasmeister> @emptyantics Season 1 and 3 are amazing
[3:45:44] <rattletrap69> SourPls 🐶 SourPls
[3:46:04] <unthought> What *bad* fighting game would you want to see made into a bad movie?
[3:46:04] <@Solidus_113> it's not as good as wanda
[3:46:05] <+aartbastiaan> @Deasmeister unpopular opinion, I thought the visions of the past were the most interesting
[3:46:06] <spaceitaly> fucky and balkan
[3:46:06] <teefpal> Wandavision is good, FATWS was bad
[3:46:06] <emptyantics> @deasmeister Thanks i’ll give it a go, is Season 2 not good?
[3:46:09] <%kyh9> I liked Bucky and Falcon more than Wandavision
[3:46:21] <Robot_Nixon_> castlevania was cool moon2S
[3:46:30] <%kyh9> i disagree
[3:46:39] <%OblivionSword1> falcon n bucky was alright
[3:46:40] <%nicversus> falcon and the walcon had the potential to be BETTER but it was weirdly handled
[3:46:41] <heysamuel> bo's new special is excellent
[3:46:41] <+Bitscreed> New season of Castlevania is good stuff.
[3:46:45] <+glgzephyr> you should bump CV up to the top of that list
[3:46:53] <DatAsuna> New castlevania I have mixed feelings about
[3:46:54] <+pkoffing> wasn't as fun as WV. I think the release schedule set our expectations too high lol
[3:46:57] <%wibbwobbler> WandaVision was great
[3:47:03] <kikoeru_san> That's been out yo
[3:47:05] <%kyh9> ehhhh
[3:47:06] <+glgzephyr> that one is a fun watch
[3:47:06] <Asuterisuku> I saw the first episode of that. It's neat.
[3:47:08] <die_hardman> I don’t really like the Post-Endgame MCU. Doesn’t feel as inspired as the rest of the MCU :(
[3:47:08] <derap41> Disapointted
[3:47:12] <Tisaric> Bo's special destroyed me this weekend in the best possible way
[3:47:12] <%thetunnelhomer> The Mouse did not want the Winter Bird show to get too political.
[3:47:13] <%kyh9> Yasuke felt like worse Afro Samurai
[3:47:14] <%pkoffing> pkoffing subscribed with Prime. 
[3:47:16] <+Prevot> yasuke seems pretty controversial
[3:47:16] <die_hardman> @jc_chance wack
[3:47:18] <%krispen_wa> reminder that Black Widow STILL hasnt come out
[3:47:19] <lc_cl7> <3
[3:47:19] <primaryfire> nioh 1 progress?
[3:47:21] <iacus_> is this a break or stream ended?
[3:47:21] <justcallmebobplease> It's a SICK season 4 that Castlevania got, and I feel like you're gonna chow down on the lore implications of how it do.
[3:47:24] <Deasmeister> The Guts moment in Castlevania is great
[3:47:26] <Asuterisuku> So weird to see a Mappa animated show designed around the English dub.
[3:47:29] <+glgzephyr> dude, there is so much that you can't do in 1 playthrough
[3:47:30] <teefpal> Yauske is too political for me
[3:47:33] <derap41> @Prevot nah its just not very good
[3:47:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1399615868909334535
[3:47:41] <%kullumanati> Yasuke is ok
[3:47:42] <Iandrasil> yeah disco is really replayable always find something new every playthrough
[3:47:47] <chll0ne> yasuke NotLikeThis
[3:47:48] <%jinking79> jinking79 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! i just found out Megalo Box Season 2 been out for two months
[3:47:51] <%OblivionSword1> yes
[3:47:52] <Asuterisuku> It just flickered.
[3:47:56] <Deko_> camera flickers every once in a while
[3:47:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> It flickered
[3:47:59] <derap41> yeah your camera is funky sometimes
[3:48:04] <%OblivionSword1> it sometimes flickers
[3:48:07] <Robot_Nixon_> its blinking :)
[3:48:15] <derap41> Its less than it was last stream at least
[3:48:19] <+BoBoGaijin> octoLurk
[3:48:22] <Deasmeister> The mechs with Yasuke are really weird
[3:48:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yours seems to blink every once in a while, but not much today
[3:48:28] <+Bitscreed> I was excited for Yasuke but hearing about stuff like Mongolian Mecha disappointed me, because the historical story is interesting enough without that stuff.
[3:48:30] <+glgzephyr> @Prevot Your Yasuke experience will vary based on how okay you are with crazy anachronisms
[3:48:37] <die_hardman> @iandrasil I only replayed it twice. Not too much replayability, unfortunately
[3:48:46] <+glgzephyr> I personally don't mind the crazy bullshit
[3:49:01] <@Solidus_113> it's GOOD
[3:49:04] <%Irridium> season 2's been real good so far
[3:49:08] <+glgzephyr> I loved season 1, and I like 2 even more
[3:49:09] <Project205> Season 2 is really good
[3:49:12] <%Arnoldoaad1> ITS REALLY GOOD
[3:49:12] <glass_marcus> Did woolie finish Korra?
[3:49:29] <derap41> @glass_marcus you're like 2 years late
[3:49:32] <+glgzephyr> the music is the best part of that show
[3:49:37] <+Prevot> wow
[3:49:44] <islandoasis> considering there is barely any info about yasuke actually, they are likely gonna do whatever with him and not care about historical accuracies.
[3:49:46] <%OblivionSword1> can't blame you
[3:49:48] <%pkoffing> THAT'S WHEN IT GETS GOOOOOD
[3:49:51] <konarius> Korra bad, baaad bad.
[3:49:52] <DatAsuna> It's a shame, you were right before the bit people like. lol
[3:49:52] <+aartbastiaan> Pat is fuming
[3:49:53] <%kyh9> Fell off, just like the writers did!
[3:49:57] <Iandrasil> @die_hardman well I disagree man, I've played it 6 times now and I still find new things especially with the final cut
[3:49:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> "good"
[3:50:02] <%kyh9> Season 3 is good tho
[3:50:03] <+mechslayer71> 3 is the beta season
[3:50:04] <Deasmeister> Ah season 3 is great
[3:50:07] <+mechslayer71> Best*
[3:50:08] <%kyh9> Season 3 is the GOOD ONE
[3:50:11] <Demoliboy2> has playing a rpg like disco elysium tempted you to play ttrpgs like dnd and call of cthulu?
[3:50:14] <%Irridium> season 3 is lit
[3:50:15] <ulcaban> there's a good video by Xiran about Korra that just came out
[3:50:15] <%smyld> Season 3 is the good one
[3:50:24] <+aartbastiaan> ye 3 is really good
[3:50:26] <chll0ne> season 3 is pretty decent tho damn
[3:50:30] <DatAsuna> Do you still have those comics you borrowed from minh? lol
[3:50:36] <chll0ne> rest of the show is cmonBruh
[3:50:44] <+glgzephyr> It fucking kills me that there was never any soundtrack released for seasons 2-4
[3:50:50] <+Bitscreed> You can open up the weasel's house near the greenhouse
[3:50:53] <+glgzephyr> it kills the composer too
[3:50:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> You went hard on that autopsy Woolz
[3:51:02] <Asuterisuku> You got points with Kim! 10 GCBC
[3:51:10] <%OblivionSword1> You go in BULLSHIT BLAZING
[3:51:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also broken
[3:51:14] <heemwizard> he still doesnt know its broken...
[3:51:14] <%doomerskeletor13> I think it’s broken
[3:51:14] <unthought> Now that your hands are covered in corpse, go see the smoker on the balcony.
[3:51:15] <die_hardman> @iandrasil r u referring to the political quests( the moralist one is the best imo)? Aside from that, you can do every check in the span of two play throughs, even w/o savescumming.
[3:51:21] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> broken
[3:51:22] <ingman112> It’s not even functionsl
[3:51:23] <islandoasis> >obvious exits are NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and DENIS
[3:51:24] <derap41> Reload porn is awesome
[3:51:25] <+mechslayer71> It also doesn’t work
[3:51:26] <laserbeaming> it's breach loading. You can reload that pretty fast
[3:51:36] <derap41> tactile
[3:51:42] <+SomeRagamuffin> satisfying
[3:51:42] <Iandrasil> @die_hardman you are missing on so many passive checks and mutually exclusive hidden flags
[3:51:49] <%kyh9> Mechanical mastery
[3:51:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> High motorics
[3:51:53] <Iandrasil> a lot of passive checks are the ones that determine a lot
[3:51:56] <%holydeviant1> Woolie has high motorics
[3:51:58] <%OblivionSword1> Guns feels good to play with
[3:52:00] <Asuterisuku> There's an early scene in DMC4 in which Nero reloads his pistol.
[3:52:01] <%kyh9> The machine becomes an extension of the body
[3:52:13] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> THIS GUN
[3:52:15] <primaryfire> red dead 2 is good for this
[3:52:22] <%SirGO0SE> the red9 actually turns me on
[3:52:33] <islandoasis> best reloads were the bolt action rifle, red9, broken butterfly
[3:52:40] <laserbeaming> @Asuterisuku And that reload was enough to last for the rest of the game!
[3:52:41] <%holydeviant1> Woolie should play Reciever 2
[3:52:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Hell yeah Comrade
[3:52:43] <+glgzephyr> @SirGO0SE Stock Kreygasm
[3:52:44] <+aartbastiaan> Communist UP
[3:52:47] <%holydeviant1> Lots of reloadin' in that
[3:52:49] <+mechslayer71> Check the bullet
[3:52:49] <islandoasis> and of course, the "reload" for the typewriter
[3:52:51] <derap41> Communism is inevitable
[3:52:53] <FassieFons> "communism is okay" --woolie madden
[3:52:54] <penitentpendant> Communist Apocacop
[3:52:55] <iacus_> tbh a lot of the game's "default" responses are tagged communist
[3:52:55] <dukenux> you can always reload fists like Henry Cavill
[3:53:03] <penitentpendant> Fitting, honestly
[3:53:04] <+glgzephyr> big communism, huh?
[3:53:07] <iacus_> not just the overtly communist ones
[3:53:08] <die_hardman> @iandrasil ah yea right those. I dunno, I feel it’s too much work to go through the same story beats over n over. But I’m glad you’re loving the replays :)
[3:53:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie going for the ultimate Centrist route by doing all the ideologies
[3:53:09] <Asuterisuku> @Asuterisuku I literally stop shooting every three shots as Nero in reference to that scene.
[3:53:17] <%doomerskeletor13> You are correct
[3:53:17] <%nicversus> Woolie is the most centrist communist
[3:53:22] <%OblivionSword1> those guys gonna take a while
[3:53:24] <derap41> a case file takes half an hour
[3:53:24] <+Bitscreed> You got Cuno's secret fuckden to open up too
[3:53:26] <chll0ne> tankie time lets goooooo
[3:53:29] <+glgzephyr> it's pretty easy to get Kingdom of Conscience by Day 3, he'll probably see it
[3:53:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah Cuno told you about his secret she’d
[3:53:40] <heemwizard> @Bitscreed yeah this too
[3:53:41] <%OblivionSword1> @glgzephyr he already has it
[3:53:43] <ingman112> @glgzephyr He has every political though I believe
[3:53:46] <+aartbastiaan> Harry is a Cunoist
[3:53:47] <jorniev> last of us 2 has good gun animations I hear, just not realistic gun fixing and interactions
[3:53:47] <elshadow7> You could check on cuno's dad, it's on the way to the smoker @WoolieVersus
[3:53:50] <SomeAsianDood> He's already a centrist
[3:53:53] <heemwizard> @glgzephyr the moralist quest is pretty long tho
[3:53:55] <%doomerskeletor13> @glgzephyr He already got it. He’s got every ideologiy
[3:53:58] <+glgzephyr> Oh, he's internalized it?
[3:54:01] <heemwizard> best to do that first
[3:54:04] <jorniev> OH
[3:54:06] <%OblivionSword1> oh no not yet
[3:54:08] <SomeAsianDood> I don't think he's internalized it yet
[3:54:09] <%doomerskeletor13> You don’t have to internalize it
[3:54:10] <+glgzephyr> gotcha
[3:54:11] <nikiv__> did he pay for his room? i don't remember
[3:54:15] <jorniev> HE FOUND IT!?
[3:54:21] <derap41> huh this seems like a concept thing to say
[3:54:22] <Asuterisuku> He found it!
[3:54:23] <+glgzephyr> wait you don't have to internalize KoC to get the quesT?
[3:54:25] <WakeUpThrow> He did!
[3:54:25] <DatAsuna> cauliflower cheese is <3
[3:54:26] <SomeAsianDood> GOD HANDS REGGIE @jorniev
[3:54:40] <spaceitaly> i do like some bang-bang-cauliflower
[3:54:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:54:40] <+mechslayer71> @jorniev yep. Reggie had the Midas touch, 28 percent
[3:54:47] <+SomeRagamuffin> holy moley
[3:54:57] <jorniev> YUP
[3:54:57] <Asuterisuku> Encyclopedia said something useful!
[3:54:58] <WakeUpThrow> Lucky Ted lives on as Lucky Reg
[3:54:58] <derap41> nah
[3:54:59] <%doomerskeletor13> @glgzephyr Nope. I did the fascism one without internalizing Revacholian Nationhood. Just accepting the thought is enough
[3:55:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> No
[3:55:01] <gunsrlove> No
[3:55:02] <heemwizard> yes
[3:55:03] <unthought> no
[3:55:07] <heemwizard> or no
[3:55:07] <Miklosher> maybe
[3:55:09] <jorniev> NO?
[3:55:10] <Deasmeister> No
[3:55:10] <%OblivionSword1> not necessarily
[3:55:11] <derap41> Jacked just mean something is covering the core of the bullet
[3:55:14] <+glgzephyr> @doomerskeletor13 That's great to know, ty
[3:55:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "yes" "no" i love you chat
[3:55:19] <jorniev> I guess no
[3:55:21] <+aartbastiaan> yes
[3:55:23] <die_hardman> Yes and no?
[3:55:26] <gunsrlove> Nope, a bullet jacket is a hard metal cover over the soft metal material
[3:55:33] <%OblivionSword1> pistols caliber can also be jacketed
[3:55:34] <+aartbastiaan> KKona
[3:55:36] <spaceitaly> jacketed just means a thin coating of metal around the core
[3:55:37] <aiutare47> No. Pistols are jacketed
[3:55:44] <Indigo_Automaton> Kim is Inland Empire now
[3:55:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> Handgun rounds are usually jacketed as well, unless they're specifically meant to be softpoint rounds for less penetration
[3:55:46] <heemwizard> talk to rene
[3:55:51] <aiutare47> Jackets mean rifling usually
[3:55:55] <laserbeaming> don't be afraid to be crazy
[3:55:58] <+glgzephyr> @heemwizard He's going to talk to him anyways
[3:56:01] <primaryfire> until now we thought the murder weapon was a cargo belt
[3:56:07] <%illusiveSaint> wouldnt all bullets be jacketed unless your specifying rifles like 5.56/
[3:56:08] <jorniev> YES No maybe I don't know... could you repeat the question?
[3:56:12] <derap41> @aiutare47 What in gods name are you talking avout
[3:56:34] <+glgzephyr> @derap41 I don't think he knows
[3:56:40] <gunsrlove> Most common bullets are jacketed.
[3:56:47] <gunsrlove> But in Disco world
[3:56:55] <gunsrlove> They still use lead balls for some reason
[3:56:56] <+glgzephyr> @gunsrlove Not in Disco\
[3:56:58] <Dakuu75> I keep thinking the shell and jacket of a bullet are the same thing but..,. i'm 100% i'm wrong
[3:57:06] <aiutare47> @derap41 the only guns that use unjacketed bullets now a days are muzzleloaders and the occasional old revolver
[3:57:07] <laserbeaming> Disco World has muzzle loaders as the most common thing
[3:57:13] <Deasmeister> Rcm uses old style pistols
[3:57:13] <%OblivionSword1> in disco case it must be from a rifle cause the pistol in this world still uses balls
[3:57:27] <+aartbastiaan> Disco is half steam punk half genuinely industrial, it's not like our world
[3:57:33] <Estwilde> Not necessarily the size of the firearm, but the speed of the projectile
[3:57:57] <+burntbagels13> balistics
[3:57:57] <muXPerience> they give the cops and gangstas muzzleloaders, anything else belongs to better paid killers
[3:58:07] <+glgzephyr> @aartbastiaan The most disorienting part of DE is for me is how this world is so similar yet so different in fundamental ways
[3:58:08] <derap41> @aiutare47 ok I see where you're coming from but jacketed ammo does not mean rifling
[3:58:16] <drunken_lemur> @aartbastiaan I know. I love it.
[3:58:19] <FightningX> Oh wow, he found the bullet at the crime scene
[3:58:27] <Asuterisuku> Lots of bonuses.

[3:58:33] <+aartbastiaan> channel your inner american
[3:58:34] <konarius> no it is sillier, bullets are proper cased cartridges, they are just allowed to have semi-automatics, in an extremely silly Moralist belief
[3:58:34] <+askalta> check the rifle
[3:58:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YO LETS GO
[3:58:45] <+glgzephyr> can you pump your HE C?
[3:58:49] <aiutare47> @derap41 not strictly no, but if I saw a cast lead bullet I would immediately think muzzleloader. Not a rifle.
[3:58:52] <konarius> they are not allowed to have semis
[3:58:56] <iacus_> shininguu fingaa

[4:01:40] <elshadow7> Yeah no, it's just a permanent demerit, don't worry about it
[4:01:41] <%illusiveSaint> i mean its an easy check if its at 1 for 58%
[4:01:41] <ingman112> And it’s worth keeping tbh
[4:01:41] <Dakuu75> wait so, does this game actually take place during an apocalypse? (Just reading "cop of the apocalypse")
[4:01:44] <CuttleCrow> better to balance out by spending on H/E/C
[4:01:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's worth it

[4:02:28] <%illusiveSaint> @Dakuu75 no, it just means you think it's inevitable
[4:02:36] <+glgzephyr> @laserbeaming The thought of Harry's hands shaking from how shit it all is during certain H/E C checks fucking sends me

[4:10:28] <%hax_metatron> Style rating: D
[4:10:34] <%OblivionSword1> MORE SHIVERS
[4:10:36] <laserbeaming> do it
[4:10:38] <Myrkbat> do it coward
[4:10:39] <%AbnormalVoid> 6 is a good spot for any stat
[4:10:41] <+askalta> just put your shivers rcm coat on
[4:10:43] <derap41> Half light is crying in the corner
[4:10:46] <die_hardman> @aartbastiaan what would be long? 300?
[4:10:48] <VatgrownHobo> Did they succeed the footprints?
[4:10:48] <Dakuu75> is Cuno ok? what's he doing there?
[4:10:49] <+glgzephyr> @die_hardman There are so many alternate universes where all the closes calls with nuclear holocaust that we've avoided actually happened. We're just relatively lucky so far.
[4:10:49] <sushahana> you want those impossible checks
[4:10:51] <%OblivionSword1> yeeeeee
[4:10:53] <ingman112> You do have a shivers/esprit coat
[4:10:55] <+aartbastiaan> @die_hardman a couple thousand
[4:10:55] <Estwilde> There's no reason to stop you, Wools. Every play through is viable
[4:11:00] <heemwizard> @derap41 half light is useless except for one time
[4:11:10] <pennykettle_> could show rene the photo
[4:11:11] <derap41> @heemwizard I know
[4:11:16] <CuttleCrow> almost 21:00
[4:11:18] <heemwizard> can u
[4:11:18] <%Vigonept> the foot prints?
[4:11:22] <laserbeaming> half light fucks you up more than it helps you LUL
[4:11:24] <heemwizard> not yet i think
[4:11:24] <%illusiveSaint> careful not to dump all your points on 1 skill or you'll softlock
[4:11:25] <$TheFabledAble> foot prints
[4:11:27] <iacus_> what backdoor?
[4:11:28] <sushahana> shivers, esprit coat and inland make your professor x
[4:11:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that door is outside btw
[4:11:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> @die_hardman Well virtually every nuclear-capable country uses fusion-type nukes. I meant that I could literally go buy off-the-shelf parts from my auto parts stores and construct a bomb for less than a few thousand dollars
[4:11:30] <pennykettle_> oh hes old he may have gone to bed
[4:11:30] <die_hardman> @aartbastiaan we’ll probably have a nuke go off, eventually. But that’s neither here nor there, for the time being.
[4:11:31] <unthought> borscht?
[4:11:32] <%MrAtheGreat> Can also check the witness
[4:11:32] <%OblivionSword1> check him
[4:11:34] <Indigo_Automaton> Foot prints at the scene
[4:11:36] <%MrAtheGreat> the evart guy
[4:11:40] <heemwizard> half light is hilarious tho
[4:11:46] <heemwizard> eh finally
[4:11:49] <iacus_> What about the smoker?
[4:11:50] <+aartbastiaan> @die_hardman actually scratch that. I just want us to survive the next world war
[4:12:00] <CuttleCrow> smoker is at 21:00
[4:12:10] <DSD24> The bullet is the new mug
[4:12:11] <lamancha97> smoker
[4:12:22] <heemwizard> doesnt matter
[4:12:25] <Eger007> examine the footprints
[4:12:40] <derap41> nah Mosin
[4:12:43] <die_hardman> @aartbastiaan memento mori, carpe diem. Best to not worry about things out of our control.
[4:12:47] <%OblivionSword1> not even mosin
[4:13:08] <%illusiveSaint> hes old whats he gonna do
[4:13:11] <derap41> Did Russia have a Breach loader?
[4:13:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> impossible you say?
[4:13:39] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[4:13:49] <resloxxx> FeelsBadMan
[4:13:50] <%OblivionSword1> @derap41 yes actually M1867 Russian Krnka
[4:14:34] <laserbeaming> If everyone uses muzzle loaders, it makes sense jacketed 4.46mm bullets are hard to find.
[4:14:34] <+askalta> yeah..
[4:14:37] <pennykettle_> Hes not getting no vaccine
[4:14:38] <heemwizard> like most men
[4:14:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh yea we all know someone like that huh?
[4:14:56] <AngryAsian5> There's always one like that in the family.
[4:14:59] <alroy900> oh, reminds me of my gramp
[4:14:59] <laserbeaming> Gaston is probably as close as family as Rene has
[4:15:05] <pennykettle_> I think we ALL know someone like that
[4:15:05] <derap41> @OblivionSword1 oh yeah that's cool

[4:17:15] <pennykettle_> FeelsBadMan
[4:17:17] <derap41> Monarchist being taken care of by a socialist LUL
[4:17:30] <%alpharius88> Rene will never accept free money
[4:17:31] <penitentpendant> Kratos: "You find dying of old age... shameful?"
[4:17:32] <+glgzephyr> SITH
[4:17:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> jesus
[4:17:36] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s gotta be so salty that a socialist is taking care of him
[4:17:39] <%illusiveSaint> aka govt veterans pensions are crap
[4:17:39] <%OblivionSword1> Evrart is SUPER corrupt but he does genuinely care for the Union
[4:17:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> Evart Is corrupt....for the PEOPLE
[4:17:43] <DatAsuna> Okay kreia
[4:17:49] <+Jeshk0> gotta get the olds working amirite

[4:18:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> money from bottles you bought tho LUL
[4:18:26] <TheApeGatsby> Recycling $$$
[4:18:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> one of those types
[4:18:34] <heemwizard> you can only say one i think
[4:18:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Moralist
[4:18:39] <Deasmeister> 3 bucks a day lets go
[4:18:40] <+SomeRagamuffin> Reduce, Reuse, Get Paid
[4:18:54] <Parapattern> Don't pity me. (Pity me tho)
[4:19:01] <derap41> Communism Fascist moralist and capitalist
[4:19:07] <derap41> and then there's Hobo
[4:19:08] <%alpharius88> off
[4:19:12] <drunken_lemur> Hustlegrind!
[4:19:15] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s: communist, fascist, moralist, ultraliberal, and non-committal
[4:19:17] <%OblivionSword1> I do it as well IRL
[4:19:17] <dukenux> old people collecting trash is a real thing
[4:19:33] <%OblivionSword1> pay for drinks
[4:19:36] <derap41> @dukenux
[4:19:40] <heemwizard> @doomerskeletor13 non-committal is the moralist option
[4:19:42] <derap41> God damn keyboard
[4:19:44] <%hax_metatron> He could be you
[4:19:46] <heemwizard> very often
[4:19:47] <%hax_metatron> In the future
[4:19:50] <KaseKaizer> FeelsBadMan
[4:19:56] <%Arnoldoaad1> I think this might be a long conversation
[4:20:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh?
[4:20:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> Reggie with the call backs
[4:20:07] <+glgzephyr> maybe you should talk to Gaston?
[4:20:09] <FightningX> Non-committing is committing to the status quo, which is moralist
[4:20:15] <derap41> @dukenux When the pension doesn't last and you've got nothing better to do with your time
[4:20:17] <%doomerskeletor13> @heemwizard The tare bag option is what was non-committal, that’s not Moralist. I was talking about those options specifically
[4:20:31] <heemwizard> yea that makes sense
[4:20:35] <ingman112> This is great music for this
[4:20:38] <%OblivionSword1> ey it opens
[4:20:44] <+glgzephyr> Reggie?
[4:20:44] <heemwizard> man should had spent on composure
[4:21:06] <heemwizard> but lot of clothes to raise that if i recall
[4:21:10] <+glgzephyr> shining finger off CD?
[4:21:21] <laserbeaming> I remember there's a windbreaker that adds composure? I think it's at Siileng's

[4:22:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:22:47] <+Jeshk0> Rene was a monarchist :/
[4:22:53] <%OblivionSword1> Rene was for real in his youuth
[4:22:56] <derap41> Old forgotten veterans are just the saddest shit
[4:23:08] <+aartbastiaan> oof
[4:23:13] <%Juriasu> oh wow those choices
[4:23:19] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[4:23:20] <heemwizard> sometimes molding someone from birth to be the leader isnt that bad...
[4:23:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Lot of proud scumbags out there
[4:23:30] <heemwizard> but theres only so few examples
[4:23:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[4:23:44] <%illusiveSaint> like mr miyagi karate kid but he doesn't put away the medals
[4:23:50] <iacus_> don't be  a dcik to rené
[4:23:58] <derap41> You think he was killing babies?
[4:23:59] <%Juriasu> it sure was
[4:24:02] <+aartbastiaan> King Coke
[4:24:02] <+Jeshk0> monarchies are some REAL bullshit
[4:24:05] <+RoByte2> The purple nose candy
[4:24:08] <%OblivionSword1> on MOUNTAINS of coccaine
[4:24:15] <atema128> Rene’s not really that complicated. He’s just an asshole who’s bitter his side lost.
[4:24:30] <FightningX> Rene is PEAK boomer
[4:24:31] <heemwizard> not really
[4:24:44] <derap41> @atema128 There is some more to it than that even if he himself wont admit it
[4:25:16] <+aartbastiaan> almost no one in this game is a straight up asshole
[4:25:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh shit he got the golden skin
[4:25:22] <Chatterbox1991> litterally a Pimp Get Up
[4:25:25] <dukenux> Lord of War?
[4:25:25] <+Prevot> pre-order gun skin
[4:25:25] <%krispen_wa> ENGRAVINGS GIVE YOU NO TACTICAL ADVANTAGE
[4:25:27] <%notsoy> CALL OF DUTY PRESTIGE-ASS
[4:25:27] <Indigo_Automaton> The Nobles in Berserk
[4:25:27] <+aartbastiaan> maybe the lorry driver
[4:25:27] <derap41> Sharpe?
[4:25:28] <%OblivionSword1> oh man
[4:25:29] <Chatterbox1991> Gears of War?
[4:25:30] <Eger007> gold kalashnikovs
[4:25:32] <%BisoromiBear> wearing his fortnite skin to battle
[4:25:34] <%DevilHands_> Warzone in a nutshell
[4:25:36] <justcallmebobplease> Thinking of WW1 stuff with Kaisers?
[4:25:44] <+coolthulhuu> WW1 at the beginning
[4:25:48] <+Dragon4234> Metal gear?
[4:25:50] <+ThomasOfTroy> That's happened repeatedly in history
[4:25:56] <%dalmek> wasn't there some general who had so many medals they shone so bright and he got shot from super far away?
[4:25:56] <+CursedNobleman> call of duty bops
[4:25:59] <+Jeshk0> so many examples of arrogance turned into failure
[4:26:03] <Davimotion96> Spanish history is littered with massacres because of bulshit like this
[4:26:05] <+aartbastiaan> some rulers literally did fight on the front lines though, and would die in battle
[4:26:05] <derap41> The TV show Sharpe has a lot of that going on
[4:26:05] <iacus_> It's a bad look if your leaders get killed in battle
[4:26:15] <unthought> It was camo in the palace
[4:26:17] <iacus_> not to mention it breaks formation
[4:26:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but he grinded for that skin Kim he's not gonna NOT use it
[4:26:23] <%illusiveSaint> napoleon iii, austrian princes i think
[4:26:27] <justcallmebobplease> WW1 was the last time you saw it happening, for rather obvious reasons.
[4:26:47] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  in fact most of the German Royalty were actually super good military leaders; see Ruprecht of Bavaria
[4:26:48] <+aartbastiaan> Alexander the Great fought with his army
[4:27:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just two sides running at each other, that shit doesn't work when you have machine guns now does it?
[4:27:07] <+Jeshk0> thats some serious Soviet "go into battle, or we're also gonna shoot you" bullshit
[4:27:08] <%krispen_wa> Alexander fought with his army and got a Reality Marble for it even
[4:27:10] <pennykettle_> At some point everyone was like "lets stop wearing our bright colors of our nation to war, its not helpful"
[4:27:12] <derap41> Dignity in war died in WW1
[4:27:19] <DatAsuna> Well line formations were more about compensating for the innaccuracy of guns at the time.
[4:27:28] <%OblivionSword1> machine guns change war foreever
[4:27:37] <heemwizard> @pennykettle_ took a while for all uniform to be black and brown
[4:27:39] <Estwilde> "civilized warfare"
[4:27:43] <justcallmebobplease> Dignity died in a trench in WW1.
[4:27:44] <dukenux> nah, dignity in war was always a posturing
[4:27:44] <Trace_Bovier> the future is now
[4:27:46] <DatAsuna> so in the proper musket days, line formations actually WERE the meta over guerilla tactics
[4:27:50] <Chatterbox1991> Everyone go check out Blueprint for Armageddon by Dan Carlin
[4:27:57] <+aartbastiaan> idk man, old europe had some fucked up wars
[4:27:57] <sushahana> agincourt FeelsBadMan
[4:28:01] <Indigo_Automaton> There's never been dignity in war
[4:28:03] <DatAsuna> It wasn't until guns got properly accurate that line formations became obselete
[4:28:07] <Majinobama> woolie
[4:28:07] <+ThomasOfTroy> Generals are always fighting the last war
[4:28:09] <+aartbastiaan> Thirty Years War was more brutral
[4:28:13] <Majinobama> stop being such a beast woolie
[4:28:14] <%Irridium> didn't knights shit in their armor?
[4:28:21] <Mr_implosion> Trench warfare
[4:28:27] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[4:28:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuuuuuuuck
[4:28:34] <+fetrigon> oh shit
[4:28:34] <%OblivionSword1> oh fuck
[4:28:46] <heemwizard> should had worn plate armor
[4:28:51] <iacus_> wars were different before WWI. Never before in history had been a war so brutal and bloody. It literally changed the culture around war forever
[4:29:03] <+aartbastiaan> listen to grandpa's war stories and he'll give you money
[4:29:04] <rainbowchromatic> There are some stories of people who lost their lower jaw in the war.
[4:29:05] <+askalta> hang on, wheres suggestion?
[4:29:10] <picanoturna> volition you ok?
[4:29:12] <heemwizard> takes willpower to do it
[4:29:15] <derap41> @askalta Exactly
[4:29:18] <+glgzephyr> remember, these are HARRY'S thoughts.
[4:29:20] <%illusiveSaint> i wouldn't think so, there's lessons to be learned in war stories
[4:29:20] <+coolthulhuu> I thought that was suggestion
[4:29:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> Volition gets like that at higher levels

[4:47:44] <ingman112> He gave it sarcastically, but still gave it
[4:47:46] <pennykettle_> Your RCM Cloak is your jacket but also gives Shivers
[4:47:46] <%BisoromiBear> deep cover behind enemy lines top secret stuff
[4:47:50] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> rcm cloak is an explicitly better jacket @woolieversus
[4:47:50] <picanoturna> dont replace the tie
[4:47:52] <+aartbastiaan> I think you only get discounts/free stuff in America tho
[4:47:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> I was a Green Beret but as a Contractor

[4:48:00] <primaryfire> tie has dialogue
[4:48:00] <%OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus FYI your cloak is better than your blazer
[4:48:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> So Like I didn't have to dress out
[4:48:03] <+justianxix> not right now
[4:48:03] <depressioncherrie> never replace the tie
[4:48:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus btw the rcm coat is a straight upgrade to the jacket you have on
[4:48:05] <ingman112> Yeah RCM cloak is better than current jacket
[4:48:05] <Project205> Plus, the tie is a bro
[4:48:06] <laserbeaming> Tie talks to you

[4:48:15] <depressioncherrie> the tie is the best item in the game, never take it off
[4:48:16] <ingman112> Tie hasn’t talked to him and likely never will
[4:48:19] <+airchrysalis> it's good for the container crate
[4:48:19] <picanoturna> dont leave bratan behind you are the same

[5:14:16] <TomosukeUsagi> Oh good lord
[5:14:16] <unthought> One is Samaran, One is Seolite. Not the same countries.
[5:14:17] <FightningX> Man I can't even remember many suggestion checks
[5:14:23] <T_Sasquatch> cultural appropriation is such a dumb fucking term
[5:14:26] <sporeian94> Twitter some how adopted all of tumblr's worst qualities
[5:14:29] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> yeyeye
[5:14:39] <+SomeRagamuffin> listening is important
[5:14:42] <+SomeRagamuffin> learning
[5:14:43] <%SirGO0SE> different culture, different reaction
[5:14:45] <%DevilHands_> Thats the good shit, moments like that
[5:14:49] <%nicversus> Cultural appropriation is only a problem when brands use it to exploit cultures
[5:14:51] <%OblivionSword1> that's like most asian we like it when people like our culture
[5:14:53] <MinersLoveGames> @sporeian94 someone said that today's Twitter is 2015's Tumblr.
[5:14:55] <derap41> all cultures must remain rigid in time and space that way we're equals /s
[5:14:55] <@Solidus_113> "stop using the n-word you're not black" happens a lot on twitter
[5:14:56] <heartlesshealer> It's during a festival, so that's why it was okay
[5:14:56] <nelsonsaysbooya> Just Talk
[5:15:00] <+MightyDuckShoes> There's a difference between minstreling and just engaging a culture
[5:15:06] <T_Sasquatch> do what you want, fuck that
[5:15:06] <FightningX> I mean, I would say the Native Americans have an extremely strong case for their culture being appropriated
[5:15:08] <+anoldtoilet> cultural exchange is cool and if you're calling it "cultural appropriation" you are a segregationist who thinks cultures cant mix
[5:15:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> We want to shut down this Minority owned business...For THEM
[5:15:10] <+aartbastiaan> @oblivionsword1 like where?
[5:15:10] <MinersLoveGames> I gotta get the fuck off Twitter.
[5:15:14] <LlewynMarie> when it's people outside the culture policing it, that's when it's an issue
[5:15:14] <chll0ne> ^^^^
[5:15:16] <sporeian94> It wasn't just a girl it was a college professor
[5:15:17] <picanoturna> its just cringe
[5:15:20] <iacus_> i've only seen americans outraged about "cultural appropriation". People actually born in the culture usually don't care or even like cultural exchange
[5:15:22] <%OblivionSword1> @aartbastiaan at least in indonesia
[5:15:26] <jorniev> but not the rice hat please
[5:15:27] <pennykettle_> That video did so much damage to leftist discourse
[5:15:28] <Asuterisuku> Most of us white guys just CAN'T rock it.
[5:15:29] <TomosukeUsagi> Cultural appropriation exists, but its being used as a weapon and trivializing real acts of appropriation
[5:15:31] <chll0ne> its also case by case with cultures
[5:15:37] <sushahana> cringe can be very addicting
[5:15:43] <%nicversus> You have the right to object to anything, but you don't have the right to harass people
[5:15:43] <sporeian94> Remember the animal cross space puffs controversy
[5:15:44] <+glgzephyr> indeed
[5:15:45] <Chatterbox1991> I had an awkward conversation with my mom about wanting to wear a Pan African flag shirt during George Floyd protests
[5:15:45] <picanoturna> ok cool now wear the combo
[5:15:47] <Iza_kku> dreads are trademarked
[5:15:47] <%illusiveSaint> ive seen that vid, freshmen college students are cringe
[5:15:48] <+aartbastiaan> @oblivionsword1 nasi goreng is delicious
[5:15:50] <pennykettle_> Remember the Tsushima presentation with the musician? The guy who was insanely trained and one of very few who could do it, but he was white so people jumped at him? LUL
[5:15:53] <Monkeyweed21> @iacus_ its only offensive if said appropriation is of a racist caricature
[5:15:55] <heysamuel> god the robe is just so fucking good
[5:15:55] <+coolthulhuu> the issue often comes up when its about profit i think
[5:15:58] <FightningX> @TomosukeUsagi This, its in a similar vein to identity politics
[5:16:01] <derap41> This Mesh and Rice hat is the look of a god
[5:16:02] <+glgzephyr> PUT ON THE HAT THO
[5:16:03] <chll0ne> u dont want to be dismissive when it comes to cultures that have been erased and appropriated
[5:16:04] <heartlesshealer> wear it with the hat?
[5:16:07] <heemwizard> talk to sunday friend with ti
[5:16:09] <MinersLoveGames> I can think of very, very few white folks who can pull off a dreads. Maybe one of those viking-style braids, but that's about it.
[5:16:09] <heemwizard> *it
[5:16:09] <+AugiJr> "You don't know our culture" "Stop trying to experience our culture"
[5:16:10] <%OblivionSword1> @aartbastiaan it is especially if you get it from the street stall
[5:16:11] <T_Sasquatch> Im offended for YOU . Im the good guy :)
[5:16:12] <iacus_> @Monkeyweed21 yeah agreed
[5:16:15] <+Prevot> white people should be allowed to have dreads, but IMO it always looks like shit on them, so they shouldn't do it LUL
[5:16:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Put on both
[5:16:26] <picanoturna> you look great harry
[5:16:28] <+glgzephyr> you cannot sell your clothes, the pawn shop won't take them
[5:16:40] <+aartbastiaan> @oblivionsword1 never tried that, but I'm dutch so we have it everywhere
[5:16:42] <Asuterisuku> He went for it.
[5:16:42] <jorniev> OOOOH yeah the flute player from the tsushima demo
[5:16:46] <heartlesshealer> okay then
[5:16:50] <MinersLoveGames> Viking dreads work for white people. That's, like, the only exception.
[5:16:52] <FightningX> Which is bullshit because some clothes are just straight up better than others and having to sort through everything later sucks
[5:16:56] <jorniev> poor guy
[5:16:56] <picanoturna> this guy
[5:17:01] <%OblivionSword1> @aartbastiaan oh cool

[5:28:18] <%illusiveSaint> rhetoric wanting to be radical
[5:28:18] <Ids560> of course they murdered all those communists. it was "The right thing to do"
[5:28:18] <gamewarden92> Stocks went up when they bombed the city.
[5:28:19] <%thetunnelhomer> And then they do some wack stuff.
[5:28:19] <picanoturna> swerved
[5:28:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> spoken like a true moralist
[5:28:22] <buffcat> nice dodge Kim
[5:28:22] <derap41> Pussed out
[5:28:22] <+glgzephyr> Doesn't look like anything to me
[5:28:23] <FightningX> Moralists fucked up the city and left it a shithole, it's implied to have been way worse before Evart and co came in

[5:30:57] <%egalitarian696969> bottom left was bombed by the US in the 70s

[5:30:58] <%MrAtheGreat> 1 is neautral I think
[5:30:59] <BernieSandworm> bottom left would be too comfortable to choose
[5:31:00] <picanoturna> will woolie pretend he isnt who he is
[5:31:02] <Ids560> 3 is not bottom right
[5:31:03] <T_Sasquatch> woolie vs mass effect when
[5:31:04] <%Vigonept> ARE YOU A COMMIE OR A DIRTY CENTRIST
[5:31:07] <heemwizard> so bottom right?
[5:31:10] <%kyh9> Oh, Moralism is VERY bottom Left
[5:31:24] <%thetunnelhomer> Moralism is nowhere near the left, what?
[5:31:29] <Ids560> moralism is the dead fuckin center
[5:31:35] <+anoldtoilet> the political compass is a meme and not how politics actually works.
[5:31:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ahhhhh he got ya!
[5:31:44] <%MrAtheGreat> YO WOOLIE WHAT DID YOU SAY
[5:31:46] <%MrAtheGreat> ABOUT CHAOS
[5:31:47] <%Vigonept> not peace, stagnating
[5:31:51] <AngryAsian5> ANARCHY
[5:31:53] <+glgzephyr> WOOLIE YOU CHOSE 1
[5:31:53] <CryHavoc_12> How long we been streaming?
[5:31:53] <iacus_> true centrism and close bottom left overlap more than others
[5:31:54] <%kyh9> You're right actually, moralism is centrism, but I'm wondering what bottom left is
[5:31:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yo what did woolie say?
[5:31:58] <+glgzephyr> DID YOU READ IT?
[5:32:01] <KaseKaizer> APOCALYPSE COP PogChamp
[5:32:01] <Inqy833> There aren’t many straight up anarchist options in DE
[5:32:01] <+anoldtoilet> anarchy ftw, actually.
[5:32:02] <+Jeshk0> Apocolypse Cop strikes again!
[5:32:03] <iacus_> moralism is made up and doesn't have a real world equivalent
[5:32:03] <picanoturna> woolie is swerving
[5:32:03] <%egalitarian696969> anarchy =/= chaos
[5:32:09] <FightningX> The political compass is the astrology of politics for people who don't understand politics
[5:32:10] <mariothemaio> peace and prosperity, but after we bomb everyone to get our version of it :)
[5:32:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that leans to a mid-life crisis
[5:32:10] <SomeAsianDood> Moralism is slightly to the left but infinitesimally so
[5:32:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Moralism presents itself as bottom left but it’s center
[5:32:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[5:32:25] <heemwizard> its not halting progression
[5:32:27] <%kyh9> Nah man, Slooooooow progressing
[5:32:30] <+glgzephyr> it's not about HALTING progression, it's about slowing it down. A lot. Like a lot a lot.
[5:32:31] <heemwizard> its VERY SLOW progression
[5:32:34] <mariothemaio> woolie becoming a communist in real time, so proud of him LUL
[5:32:35] <%thetunnelhomer> Prosperity, but not for you.
[5:32:36] <Chatterbox1991> reeks of establishment Democrats imo
[5:32:37] <+eanscrale> Remember comrades every point not for the proletariat is a point to this dick wad.
[5:32:38] <TCDerps> Peace in this instance means status quo
[5:32:38] <%doomerskeletor13> No not halting, just slow imperceptible change
[5:32:42] <%akajaybay> it's progressing, just so slow it's almost imperceptible
[5:32:44] <derap41> Moralism is humanism minimize total suffering compared to individual suffering
[5:32:44] <sushahana> obey the status quo!
[5:32:47] <%kyh9> It's slow progress, not no progress
[5:32:49] <StarlitStunner> Destroy the means of production
[5:32:53] <%krispen_wa> It's like prog rock. it gets somewhere sometimes, but it takes 23 minutes
[5:32:54] <elshadow7> Apocalypse cop 10?!
[5:32:58] <candidateplays> This is the Ultralib option
[5:33:00] <+Jeshk0> apocalypse cop for sure
[5:33:00] <Sarakin2> It may as well be no progress
[5:33:04] <Asuterisuku> There's room for more stats.
[5:33:06] <%MrAtheGreat> FUCK THIS GUY
[5:33:07] <mariothemaio> it's slow progress but it's so slow it can't even be perceived
[5:33:10] <derap41> That line is way to real
[5:33:11] <%nicversus> @StarlitStunner LUL LUL LUL
[5:33:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I HATE HIM

[5:33:16] <iacus_> I wouldn't say it's exactly a motte and bailey. He didn't really expose an indefensible position
[5:33:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> This man says, in a literally half-destroyed building
[5:33:26] <jorniev> THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT
[5:33:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:33:28] <Ultimatefool> MR MARKETING
[5:33:28] <picanoturna> it will take 30k years for progress to be achieved
[5:33:30] <+glgzephyr> the politician smile
[5:33:33] <Chatterbox1991> the Joe Biden smile
[5:33:33] <librettodude> bottom-left would be social liberty as opposed to bottom-rights' fiscal liberty, I think
[5:33:34] <Ids560> I agree with that one person, this guy is the worst
[5:33:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> The game is telling you to hate him
[5:33:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Joe Biden ass
[5:33:46] <derap41> Woolie would you rather have been here during the revolution
[5:33:54] <mariothemaio> this dude is one of the most hateable in the game imo
[5:33:56] <%illusiveSaint> bottom left would be anarcho-communist
[5:34:04] <mariothemaio> someone with real power who talks down to you, ugh
[5:34:10] <%OblivionSword1> EPIS LUL
[5:34:11] <%doomerskeletor13> This game is not shy about its developers Marxist leanings. It’s why Moralism probably gets it the worst
[5:34:14] <FightningX> If you say you wanna change things but do it so so slow that it's inperceptible, you're not actually for change

[5:36:47] <BernieSandworm> at least joyce really is charming
[5:36:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> This man definitely went to little Saint James
[5:36:51] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[5:36:52] <%doomerskeletor13> DOES SHE
[5:36:52] <heemwizard> ultraliberalism is also the way to go
[5:36:53] <Ids560> Joyce is pretty evil but this guy is pure scum
[5:36:53] <+Pequod1> Joyce is just the right kind of crazy
[5:36:56] <sushahana> he sees the truth
[5:36:56] <%Vigonept> shes charmingly straight forward
[5:37:00] <alexandrecau> somwtime the old lady that give you money is cool
[5:37:01] <AngryAsian5> Joyce puts it all out there
[5:37:01] <%MrAtheGreat> Remember when she would explain things? Those were good times.
[5:37:03] <%kyh9> A third political axis: coolness
[5:37:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @pookiedaexzile he has a timeshare there
[5:37:06] <picanoturna> joyce gets it
[5:37:09] <jorniev> AT least Joyce has agency and depth
[5:37:10] <derap41> You only like her because she's charming
[5:37:13] <mariothemaio> our sugar momma is great
[5:37:15] <+glgzephyr> joyce is by far the most straight of all the major players here
[5:37:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> I want Joyce to be my sugar momma
[5:37:17] <+askalta> i think shes a crazy war criminal but i do liker her
[5:37:18] <Monkeyweed21> Joyce is a good person working for an evil corp
[5:37:19] <%doomerskeletor13> She’s charming but she also contributed to the reason this world is the way it is
[5:37:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imagine trying to get your bearings from him
[5:37:23] <Deasmeister> Joyce is great she understands at least
[5:37:27] <%nicversus> Joyce has self awareness and a conscience
[5:37:30] <crunchington001> This isn't a man, this is a series of spreadsheets hooked up to a text-to-speech device
[5:37:30] <needforsleep8888> Joyce knows and admits what she is
[5:37:31] <Myrkbat> ResidentSleeper
[5:37:38] <ingman112> “I forgive you, but only because you’re charming”
[5:37:39] <alexandrecau> Everyone is contributing to this shit show
[5:37:40] <heemwizard> ah like turkey and the EU
[5:37:46] <+glgzephyr> Thirty years of legal limbo
[5:37:46] <%nuttbrain> Turkey and the EU I guess
[5:37:47] <+anoldtoilet> this is like bob from twin peaks level demonic presence
[5:37:47] <jorniev> EPIS
[5:37:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BEPIS
[5:37:48] <derap41> @doomerskeletor13 Its kinda fucked seeing everyone love her so much feel to real
[5:37:48] <Miklosher> EPIS = EU
[5:37:49] <iacus_> yeah Joyce is a fully realized character. This guy is exist just for the Writer making a Point
[5:37:52] <FightningX> Are you a nazi, a commie, or THIS GUY?
[5:37:53] <marcdyllan> So Turkey...
[5:37:54] <+MightyDuckShoes> Joyce can get the Jamrock Shuffle SeemsGood
[5:37:55] <%nuttbrain> YEP EPIS
[5:37:58] <%Nullseven> Joyce is charming evil
[5:37:58] <+Pequod1> Joyce knows how evil what she does is, and human enough to hate herself for it
[5:38:02] <%doomerskeletor13> I see everyone’s stats have been comprised by Joyce
[5:38:07] <mariothemaio> joyce at least knows that she's the vilest of the vile and embraces it in her charm and self-satire. this dude lacks awareness of how awful he is in comparison
[5:38:12] <Inqy833> Joyce is one of those rightwingers who doesn’t feel the need to make up stuff to justify their opinions. The Sunday Friend is basically all self justification and obfuscation.
[5:38:12] <%MrAtheGreat> THATS THE SUCCESS DETERMINATION?
[5:38:13] <picanoturna> shut up logic
[5:38:18] <+glgzephyr> Logic likes things making sense
[5:38:19] <+Sir_Louis> I'm most proud of my interactions with this guy where I managed to piss him off so bad I got fully kicked out
[5:38:24] <sporeian94> The game does something kinda smart where I think it realizes the majority of the people who play this game are of the far left political opinions so they make the person representing the corp somewhat human and kind while the far left rep is super corrupt
[5:38:26] <+Ropcord> KKona DISGUSTING
[5:38:31] <+anoldtoilet> joyce is really bad but is one of the people who is like eh im just resigned to who i am. this guy is ALL IN on being a lizard
[5:38:35] <Indigo_Automaton> This guy's gonna go home and jerk it onto his clipboards
[5:38:37] <heemwizard> @Sir_Louis you can do that?
[5:38:42] <mariothemaio> LUL LUL
[5:38:43] <picanoturna> she is disco
[5:38:46] <%nicversus> She's not huffing her own farts-- she's huffing the pale
[5:38:46] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[5:38:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Sir_Louis how do you do that?
[5:38:58] <%MrAtheGreat> No Joyce is the best of her group. She's very open and self aware
[5:38:58] <gamewarden92> Joyce: "You 'mirin?"
[5:38:59] <Chatterbox1991> I sense a lot of vitriol directed at the European Union specifically in the way this dude is written
[5:39:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> "That sounds like Global empire with more steps"
[5:39:01] <marcdyllan> she atleast had a life b4 she got her current position
[5:39:02] <+glgzephyr> she just wants to dive back into the void. She's an addict
[5:39:03] <jorniev> she also wishes it was different
[5:39:04] <%kyh9> She's class conscious
[5:39:06] <FightningX> Multiple people throughout the game call out Evart for not actually being left wing tho
[5:39:07] <Sarakin2> remember looper?
[5:39:20] <+Pequod1> "dont think about it too hard" Looper?
[5:39:22] <+anoldtoilet> evrart kind of is, sorta
[5:39:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[5:39:25] <iacus_> I think people overestimate how many "far left" people there actually are. Especially among those that care about videogames
[5:39:40] <%MrAtheGreat> FUCUCJoiHPUHCZV
[5:39:41] <+glgzephyr> She even regrets her actions from before, knowing what they lead to
[5:39:44] <%MrAtheGreat> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE
[5:39:48] <iacus_> unless you mean far left as in american politics (which is actually centrism)

[5:50:42] <%MrAtheGreat> "Labouring Classes"
[5:50:47] <+glgzephyr> the way that Kim says that line assumes that you do this without finding the bullet
[5:50:56] <%sjay662> sjay662 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Hey Woolie, hoping you are feeling well. Got nothing else to say but take care of yourself

[5:51:26] <+Ensign_Epic> good
[5:51:26] <+glgzephyr> just sliiiide right past that one
[5:51:31] <+SomeRagamuffin> so strange that those options went straight from 1 to 3
[5:51:33] <candidateplays> Lol, 2's like that because you opted into Fascism
[5:51:35] <drunken_lemur> Oh, so you're THAT kind of cop.
[5:51:37] <Deasmeister> That changed because you have facism
[5:51:38] <%MrAtheGreat> Gee I wonder why

[5:51:56] <picanoturna> the path you chose
[5:51:56] <elshadow7> Trying to see if you're paying attention
[5:52:15] <%nicversus> did you try to subscribe to measure head's race theory? That might have made more racist options available
[5:52:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> You only get one shot do not miss your chance t o blow
[5:52:20] <heartlesshealer> No gunshots???
[5:52:25] <%MrAtheGreat> Shock eh?
[5:52:27] <heemwizard> @nicversus he didnt
[5:52:30] <BlackermanZX> shock huh
[5:52:37] <picanoturna> why no gunshots hmmm
[5:52:38] <Indigo_Automaton> This game implements racism in the same way RPG's use traps in a dungeon
[5:52:41] <Ids560> he did the check and then opted out at the end
[5:52:41] <CryHavoc_12> Seems like the Vic was attacked or unconscious?
[5:52:51] <+glgzephyr> Shock, sure. Seems like the type of guy to *avoid responsibility* because of shock.

[6:09:57] <CryHavoc_12> 🔄
[6:09:58] <picanoturna> put that boy to sleep
[6:10:09] <+glgzephyr> Time to put Kim to bed
[6:10:11] <nelsonsaysbooya> One wrong word and our boy might die
[6:10:12] <mariothemaio> laughing at chat using spoilers to make woolie do something but not knowing the actual way to get it to happen LUL LUL LUL
[6:10:12] <heemwizard> open the door then talk to joyce @WoolieVersus
[6:10:13] <%smyld> Damn that’s crazy
[6:10:21] <$JobbedBone> why can't I get notifications when I internalize an ideology IRL BibleThump
[6:10:26] <derap41> oops
[6:10:37] <+glgzephyr> wait, Woolie actually took money from her?
[6:10:42] <pennykettle_> @JobbedBone pretending my inner voice is different stats has helped me with some things
[6:10:49] <derap41> Woolie really is a pinkerton
[6:10:52] <alexandrecau> Yes that's how he paid for the room
[6:10:52] <+Ensign_Epic> I hate her ideology but holy fk Joyce is wonderful
[6:10:57] <Eger007> talk to her without kim
[6:11:00] <+glgzephyr> @alexandrecau OOF
[6:11:01] <elshadow7> @WoolieVersus you might wanna do the gun thing again with her, but without Kim
[6:11:08] <crunchington001> Put Kim to bed and come back to her
[6:11:10] <heemwizard> increase esprit de corps
[6:11:11] <picanoturna> at least she knows mr. evrart is helping you find your gun
[6:11:12] <mariothemaio> boost EDC!!!!
[6:11:16] <SomeAsianDood> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun
[6:11:19] <VatgrownHobo> improve the check for the footprints in the yard
[6:11:20] <+glgzephyr> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[6:11:20] <%Vigonept> more esprit
[6:11:27] <elshadow7> Interfacing's helpful
[6:11:28] <srv4254> logic to read ledger
[6:11:32] <picanoturna> esprit or coach
[6:11:33] <%illusiveSaint> save it
[6:11:39] <ingman112> Removing the ledger helps with authority
[6:11:40] <%nicversus> Do the opening the door thing, it's very short
[6:11:40] <pennykettle_> your stats are relatively well rounded
[6:11:42] <heemwizard> volition is also good
[6:11:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Mr. Evart is helping me find my gun.
[6:11:49] <alexandrecau> Talk to the pale driver when kim is asleep
[6:11:52] <+Ensign_Epic> bank it for an emergency reroll
[6:11:53] <+Ropcord> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[6:11:56] <%akajaybay> can always see what checks youd really like to retry
[6:11:58] <justcallmebobplease> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[6:12:00] <%Arnoldoaad1> Authority is not actually that low, its because of the ledger in is hand
[6:12:01] <heemwizard> @alexandrecau dont think he met her yet
[6:12:03] <ingman112> @alexandrecau At this point he can do it normally
[6:12:09] <derap41> Tare doesn't get high lighter
[6:12:12] <+glgzephyr> tare refreshes daily
[6:12:20] <heemwizard> wait he doesnt have enough money for rent lol
[6:12:24] <Chatterbox1991> remember to turn in the tare before the Fritte closes
[6:12:25] <%Vigonept> BOOTS
[6:12:29] <+glgzephyr> @derap41 it actually does light up when you hit tab or right click
[6:12:30] <picanoturna> gotta get the cash
[6:12:33] <ingman112> I...don’t think that’s true? That rate replenished?
[6:12:33] <alexandrecau> he paid in advance
[6:12:35] <heemwizard> and he cant sell anything anymore
[6:12:36] <%nicversus> tare in containers refreshes, but tare in the wild doesn;t
[6:12:39] <heemwizard> oh
[6:12:43] <CryHavoc_12> Sunglasses?
[6:12:49] <derap41> @glgzephyr containers might but not loose bottles

[6:13:07] <Deasmeister> 10
[6:13:08] <alexandrecau> Kim goes to bed the moment you reach the door
[6:13:09] <%MrAtheGreat> that is 10 but you can push one until aroun 1
[6:13:09] <+glgzephyr> @derap41 Exactly, but you need the bag equipped to see the containers too
[6:13:09] <picanoturna> he goes to bed whenever you go
[6:13:21] <ingman112> He goes to bed when you do
[6:13:21] <bonebagMEL> I went and saw the "Helping me find my gun" loop and WOW THAT'S FUCKING WILD
[6:13:22] <elshadow7> "put kim to bed" LUL
[6:13:27] <alexandrecau> Oh is he ready for it though
[6:13:38] <derap41> @glgzephyr Didn't say anything about the bag
[6:13:50] <unthought> I like that in your head, the boots are already yours. Good headspace.
[6:13:55] <picanoturna> talking to titus will suck at this point
[6:13:57] <justcallmebobplease> @bonebagMEL We must push the Woolie back sans Kim!
[6:13:58] <jorniev> he is kinda ready

[6:14:59] <alexandrecau> your using your deck now
[6:14:59] <Blank9> could suggest more cards
[6:15:03] <pennykettle_> its not overthinking, youre just immersed.
[6:15:07] <SomeAsianDood> Tell her about mr. evrart is helping u find your gun
[6:15:08] <pennykettle_> which is good
[6:15:10] <picanoturna> getting things done for evrart and joyce would help a TON againt titus

[6:27:04] <Deasmeister> I'm like only 65
[6:27:05] <laserbeaming> Kg is Pound * 2, as a quick rule
[6:27:05] <FassieFons> the spectre of imperial units rears its ugly head
[6:27:14] <Asuterisuku> 1kg = 2.2lbs
[6:27:39] <FightningX> The fuck are these NON-AMERICAN measurements?

[6:29:45] <Blank9> it wasn't dragged, just the footprint was smooth
[6:29:45] <heemwizard> remember you need to investigate the drug thing anyhow
[6:29:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:29:51] <+glgzephyr> nah a limp wouldn't do that to a sole
[6:29:54] <elshadow7> A limp would probably leave a deeper and a shallower print, maybe?
[6:29:55] <pennykettle_> I think the tracks are "odd sole" because one was smoothed out
[6:29:56] <picanoturna> the traffic jam
[6:30:00] <ingman112> Yeah it’s not “one is deeper,” it’s “one is more worn down”
[6:30:01] <elshadow7> Or a drag
[6:30:01] <%nuttbrain> I assume you can see no odd gait in the tracks
[6:30:19] <%ChoculaUltra> "no wait, Kim would totally judge me" was my thought process during my first playthrough LUL
[6:30:47] <heemwizard> good suggestion
[6:30:56] <laserbeaming> Kim seems to only judge you when you hamper the investigation or when you're racist
[6:31:17] <picanoturna> like a play even

[6:31:49] <iacus_> bad cop
[6:31:56] <naoi0> Cuno doesn't fucking care
[6:31:58] <%Arnoldoaad1> I dont know why this is impressive but the dialog is very different if you do this before the autopsy
[6:32:00] <%Vigonept> nightt night kim
[6:32:00] <pennykettle_> did he viscalc the fense?

[6:32:47] <+PkSilent01> @Arnoldoaad1 I know Im saying where is it, is it in the *thing*
[6:32:48] <+mechslayer71> Check the fence at some point
[6:32:49] <gamewarden92> Have these dudes been drinking beer since Harry woke up today?
[6:32:54] <heemwizard> not yet for the door
[6:33:00] <ingman112> Correct
[6:33:01] <+glgzephyr> it's triggered by opening your room door
[6:33:04] <+Vivaciousx3> head up to your room and kim will go to sleep

[6:33:34] <+glgzephyr> no it was pretty clear
[6:33:36] <jorniev> YOUR HONOR I would like the witness account to be removed from the record on account on him being FUking lame
[6:33:37] <Miklosher> the shed and the fence are both different things
[6:33:38] <heemwizard> he went through it
[6:33:41] <heemwizard> but this is nice too
[6:33:45] <CryHavoc_12> We go fuck now, Cuno doesn't care
[6:33:46] <ingman112> It’s to the right
[6:33:49] <pennykettle_> oh this too but we meant the fence you walk through to get to cuno
[6:33:57] <FightningX> WOW
[6:34:02] <+Jeshk0> wow he almost failed D:

[6:34:37] <%Arnoldoaad1> Night City
[6:35:02] <+glgzephyr> @Indigo_Automaton But both this eternite thing and the one on the coast look and sound like wood planks
[6:35:08] <%Sarevic> The fence y'all walk through to enter the backyard is also an interactable

[6:37:18] <pennykettle_> LUL
[6:37:27] <$hattrick61> steal cunos cash
[6:37:29] <ingman112> No way to transport it
[6:37:35] <derap41> Just some extra stuff
[6:37:37] <iacus_> alt solution te get tot the harbor
[6:37:37] <Ids560> you can jump down from here to avoid measurehead
[6:37:38] <picanoturna> some loot
[6:37:46] <+Ropcord> the true dark souls starts now
[6:37:46] <alexandrecau> are tidus and co  leaving at midnight
[6:37:53] <derap41> instead of beating Measurehead you can sneak in
[6:37:59] <jorniev> circumvent measure Head
[6:38:05] <Inqy833> It’s a way around measure head
[6:38:07] <ingman112> This is the “high Motorics” way to get in
[6:38:11] <alexandrecau> I recall they sray late but not forever
[6:38:14] <+glgzephyr> and now what LUL
[6:38:14] <picanoturna> no
[6:38:15] <heemwizard> no too bad
[6:38:17] <tattleworm> nah
[6:38:19] <+askalta> no
[6:38:20] <mariothemaio> nope
[6:38:21] <sychevatel> I found this thing way before I even met Measurehead
[6:38:24] <elshadow7> not quite
[6:38:24] <derap41> denied
[6:38:25] <alexandrecau> ambitious woolie
[6:38:25] <heemwizard> would be nice if u could
[6:38:25] <+hoenhime344> break in
[6:38:26] <%PMAvers> No, but you can keep going up here.
[6:38:27] <iacus_> no. that's the roof of the whirling
[6:38:30] <+glgzephyr> you'll NEVER talk to her!
[6:38:30] <mariothemaio> different building
[6:38:30] <jorniev> no
[6:38:30] <tattleworm> you can climb further to the right though
[6:38:31] <pennykettle_> @sychevatel same same
[6:38:34] <%Arnoldoaad1> not ready yet
[6:39:08] <+mechslayer71> We 6 hours deep? PogChamp
[6:39:10] <jorniev> good
[6:39:15] <pennykettle_> oh is it not even possible to jump if you took the jacket? interesting
[6:39:22] <FassieFons> roof money PogChamp
[6:39:27] <primaryfire> yeah the jacket is what prompts the jump
[6:39:32] <heemwizard> @pennykettle_ nah, you cant ko measurehead if you took that path either
[6:39:35] <derap41> almost at full health and didn't  spend a dime
[6:39:35] <KaseKaizer> but D&D bro
[6:39:42] <jorniev> this is how you got in before waking up
[6:39:43] <mariothemaio> @pennykettle_ yeah the check is only there with the coat because if you get it then the game knows you got past measurehead
[6:39:47] <picanoturna> titus time or nah
[6:39:54] <CryHavoc_12> 💸
[6:39:57] <Monkeyweed21> skip lunches to save up for a new game
[6:39:57] <+glgzephyr> It's always Titus time LUL
[6:39:58] <+mechslayer71> @woolieversus we meant the fence near the entrance of the whirling in rags btw @woolieversus
[6:40:13] <PinkSocks> minmaxing
[6:40:23] <elshadow7> there we go
[6:40:25] <mariothemaio> reggie saving us
[6:40:25] <%MrAtheGreat> Woolie's never gonna find that weasel is he?
[6:40:29] <picanoturna> reggie saved it
[6:40:29] <pennykettle_> there we go baby
[6:40:31] <+glgzephyr> you didn't touch this
[6:40:32] <derap41> you failed it last time
[6:40:35] <heemwizard> @MrAtheGreat wait a day bro
[6:40:40] <Asuterisuku> Another VC moment.
[6:40:42] <Crippl3> there what is? :)
[6:40:50] <picanoturna> piece of the big puzzle
[6:40:52] <ingman112> Perception wasn’t high enough before
[6:41:03] <SomeAsianDood> What kind of nutjob would drive through a fence
[6:41:11] <Azmodem> Ah it seems like I showed up at the Memories of a Crash part.
[6:41:23] <CryHavoc_12> Omg where he started, and his path. Kreygasm
[6:41:24] <Miklosher> and then jumped the canal
[6:41:35] <picanoturna> what a hooligan
[6:41:36] <%Arnoldoaad1> What kind of animal would do this!?
[6:41:39] <jorniev> did he check the call buttons?
[6:41:40] <pennykettle_> Visual Calc doesnt get enough credit
[6:41:41] <+glgzephyr> @Miklosher Let's not get ahead of ourselves
[6:41:48] <Asuterisuku> Nigeria exists in this world?
[6:41:48] <SomeAsianDood> yes @jorniev
[6:41:56] <Azmodem> I can only imagine a horn rendition of the lacucaracha song blaring from it as it rides over the canal
[6:41:57] <%MrAtheGreat> That dude'd get a liscense in New York
[6:41:59] <heemwizard> @Asuterisuku not actual nigeria
[6:42:13] <heemwizard> name of a cavalry and an innocence
[6:42:13] <+rancherobill> in all fairness its good on the driver to not hit the buildings and not the fence
[6:42:16] <heemwizard> if i recall
[6:42:26] <%MrAtheGreat> A veritable path of destruction
[6:42:29] <picanoturna> hmmmm
[6:42:33] <Crippl3> pieThink
[6:42:35] <derap41> Someone speeded away could it be our killer
[6:42:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey chat i left right as he asked the sunday friend about the hanging what i miss?
[6:42:52] <picanoturna> someone cool and dangerous did this
[6:42:59] <pennykettle_> sus
[6:43:00] <%AbnormalVoid> woolieSMUG
[6:43:01] <%MrAtheGreat> Right?
[6:43:05] <+glgzephyr> mhmmm
[6:43:07] <+Vivaciousx3> LUL
[6:43:07] <%Vigonept> Yeah some evil doer kim
[6:43:09] <Ids560> he has a reason
[6:43:09] <elshadow7> pretty much
[6:43:10] <heemwizard> ah i hope the stream gets there
[6:43:11] <+glgzephyr> It MUST be connected!
[6:43:12] <Crippl3> this man thinking
[6:43:13] <+Jeshk0> it must be ALL connected
[6:43:13] <shincadad> LUL
[6:43:14] <iacus_> why would it be connected?
[6:43:15] <+Telraid> its pretty sus
[6:43:16] <Fuji808> oh this will be so good
[6:43:16] <%DevilHands_> :)
[6:43:17] <CryHavoc_12> L O O P E R
[6:43:22] <derap41> yeah its pretty crazy of him to say that
[6:43:24] <nikiv__> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[6:43:34] <SomeAsianDood> Only some kind of fuck up would try and ruin an active crimescene like that
[6:43:35] <%Arnoldoaad1> @cobalt_phoenix_ he absolutely hated sunday friend and pretty much accused him of murder
[6:43:37] <Demoliboy2> @WoolieVersus no seriously, wear that tie
[6:43:39] <+glgzephyr> this is gonna be fucking great

[6:44:39] <%MrAtheGreat> Is your back doing okay?
[6:44:43] <+tabenterenter> Ty ty
[6:44:44] <unthought> This game has that "one more turn" appeal, except it's one more paragraph.
[6:44:46] <Asuterisuku> Loved the soup, need a sandwich with it.
[6:44:46] <%illusiveSaint> excellent stream! first time sitting through it woolieGLORY

[6:44:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that was a great stream, got the body down, found the real cause of death, and met sunday friend!
[6:45:11] <picanoturna> youre not really following a pattern so yeah
[6:45:15] <penitentpendant> I look forward to the clips people have done
[6:45:19] <laserbeaming> most of that is on your Journal, luckily
[6:45:24] <+glgzephyr> it's why you have a task list
[6:45:31] <tattleworm> you can almost tick off the body, that's a big part
[6:45:49] <pennykettle_> the computer also needed a password
[6:45:49] <picanoturna> ice bear
[6:46:00] <pennykettle_> fantastic game
[6:46:05] <+glgzephyr> this game's threads go deep and far
[6:46:07] <%MrAtheGreat> That ice bear LUL

[6:47:32] <%MrAtheGreat> Resident Shoguin?!
[6:47:36] <BlackermanZX> eyyy onimusha
[6:47:43] <%barkon345> that game did not age well
[6:47:50] <Crippl3> love a good orb
[6:47:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh...could this be a nioh 2 prelude? either way yay
[6:47:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but does it have the ZAPPING SYSTEM tho?
[6:48:08] <iacus_> Onimusha III has a sick intro
[6:48:08] <Crippl3> keep that in mind
[6:48:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[6:48:15] <Asuterisuku> I designed this ride
[6:48:37] <jorniev> is onimisha the one where they kick a horse in the face?
[6:48:44] <laserbeaming> docsquiddy, cool guy
[6:49:05] <jorniev> can't wait for ADIOS 2: ALOHA
[6:49:22] <Asuterisuku> And part 3: Ciao
[6:49:30] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev I still can't believe that's actually the title
[6:49:55] <Asuterisuku> Oh wait that's real?
[6:50:08] <+glgzephyr> oh is DE going to two streams a week? That's good, it's a very long game.
[6:50:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BLEETZ CODE
[6:50:29] <+askalta> no..
[6:50:32] <Crippl3> what is blitz netcode
[6:50:39] <BlackermanZX> the ghost of blitz netcode
[6:50:48] <Crippl3> blitz, like nfl blitz?
[6:50:51] <Asuterisuku> And then there's the fact that certain regions have NO SERVERS.
[6:50:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> RACIST NETCODE YEAAAA
[6:50:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:50:57] <drunken_lemur> Reggie's face
[6:50:57] <+glgzephyr> jrdud
[6:51:04] <Asuterisuku> Africa, the middle-east, and most of Asia are screwed.
[6:51:12] <iacus_> what is this, a Virtua Fighter?
[6:51:13] <+glgzephyr> lmao
[6:51:20] <IzanagiNoOokami> INFINTE VS 2: VIRTUE FIGHTER.
[6:51:24] <Crippl3> LMFAO
[6:51:27] <%MrAtheGreat> Racist Netcode
[6:51:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S THE BEST AND THE WORST
[6:51:34] <+TheLakinessMonster> Racist netcode? Incredible.
[6:51:34] <%MrAtheGreat> Africa can't get anything
[6:51:39] <+xerotwo> doodHokey
[6:51:47] <%MrAtheGreat> Neither can South America too
[6:51:47] <%wibbwobbler> :(
[6:51:55] <+glgzephyr> Apartheid Netcode
[6:52:00] <BlackermanZX> the next step is apartheid netcode
[6:52:00] <iacus_> Calling it "racist netcode" is amazingly racist lol
[6:52:13] <iacus_> fine for a joke, but oof
[6:52:18] <+glgzephyr> it's a GREAT JOKE
[6:52:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it is gonna suck. why the actual fuck do they refuse to just use rollback?
[6:52:48] <%MrAtheGreat> It's wrong, but on the flip side it'll VERY LIKELY get Sega to pay attention
[6:52:50] <%Deft_Thought> DARKEST Africa
[6:52:51] <+glgzephyr> WHAT VF COMMUNITY
[6:53:12] <+glgzephyr> Does it exist!?
[6:53:15] <BlackermanZX> its baffling why they don't use rollback
[6:53:30] <Asuterisuku> Sega's gonna Sega.
[6:53:30] <+tabenterenter> Are there waypoints in Antarctica tho?
[6:53:50] <%MrAtheGreat> Delay-based Racism? Like that Vis-Cal fail?
[6:53:51] <%ChoculaUltra> apartheid netcode LUL
[6:53:56] <laserbeaming> oh no
[6:54:01] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH doodHokey
[6:54:12] <+xerotwo> ASUKA IS THE MOCAP FOR VANESSA
[6:54:28] <%ChoculaUltra> ping is measured by slurs per second on the racism netcode
[6:54:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea but it funny tho
[6:54:35] <%MrAtheGreat> I always laugh :D
[6:54:36] <laserbeaming> this ticks all the Woolie Boxes, Fighting Games, Racism, Geopolitics
[6:54:38] <DatAsuna> that's a lot of people's humour tbh
[6:54:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> comedy meatball
