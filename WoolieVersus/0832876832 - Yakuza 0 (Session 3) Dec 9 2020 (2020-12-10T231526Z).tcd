[0:01:41] <%doomerskeletor13> @akuda_bar Unfortunately no
[0:01:48] <+Orrjekt> Cyberpunk, sci-fi samurai soulslike would be tight as hell, though
[0:01:49] <+patriotrenegade> Did he get to MAJIMA yet

[0:03:37] <%KineKithZen> Use Luxembourg or some other low traffic country
[0:03:37] <%WritebroAlpha> My hype for Cyberpunk has cooled considerably, so I'm perfectly willing to wait until like next summer to pick it up.
[0:03:39] <AngryAsian5> Yeah, I don't want to spoil Cyberpunk for myself and i won't be playing it for a couple months LUL

[0:04:26] <%condemned_15> psaBig SUS
[0:04:28] <Vicviper909> Yakuza 0 is better than Cyberpunk anyways
[0:04:31] <+doomunderthestairs> fucking love this series
[0:04:34] <+Orrjekt> Cyberpunk 1988
[0:04:34] <MyNameIsRasus> conceding i'm one of them epileptics imma keep away from that game
[0:04:40] <YamadaZero> Nice to play a working game.

[0:05:23] <danielm427> woolie 77
[0:05:26] <Solidnick18> that game doesn't have majima
[0:05:27] <+OKNewman> What's the objective here? Just shooting to 100% the game?
[0:05:28] <berserkexponent> Its just a flashback guys
[0:05:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Cyberpunk lets u play a better videogame PogChamp
[0:05:31] <DXLelouch24> yes the year of Cyberpunk the late 80s
[0:05:32] <%Indigo_Automaton> CYBERYAKUZA
[0:05:33] <YamadaZero> So much like you can play Space Harrier in Yakuza 0, you can play Yakuza 0 in Cyberpunk 2077?
[0:05:34] <CappuccinoGuil> This game won't kill epileptics, so you know, 100000x better than Cyberpunk
[0:05:36] <+xeros720> additionally, how did you know i roleplayed as a massive Japanese Man that can punch out cars?
[0:05:39] <%doomerskeletor13> You can customize Kiryus lack of virginity
[0:05:43] <DatAsuna> virtua fighter ain't in this one
[0:05:43] <danielm427> unlike smash
[0:05:46] <+b_aleph> You can't play Virtua Fighter tho!
[0:05:50] <+runegod20> I'm hoping to save enough money over a couple months to buy a rig from artisanbuilds. Even with the affiliate code I'll probably still only be able to afford the cheapest one so maybe I'll get to play cyberpunk before I die if I'm lucky
[0:05:53] <+Orrjekt> What's sad is that CP2077 likely won't even have half as many mini games and side activities as this 5 year old game
[0:05:53] <DatAsuna> it didn't exist in the 80s
[0:05:58] <alvaroeltz> yeah, this main mission is not great
[0:05:59] <President_valentine> VF doesn't exist yet
[0:06:01] <%Feralspirit41> Customize kiryus "premarital sex isnt cool" button
[0:06:03] <+Nero_Cross> it's emulators all the way down
[0:06:09] <+johnnychopsocky> 2 minutes in: "Go the other way"
[0:06:12] <Ravingpyro> theres a really good one
[0:06:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:06:15] <Tupperwarez> funnily enough, the yakuza team made binary domain, which is cyberpunk af
[0:06:20] <DatAsuna> they're the wall
[0:06:21] <@Solidus_113> I think looking around the Parks is a good start for the story
[0:06:22] <+doomunderthestairs> @WoolieVersus What do you think of beast style so far?
[0:06:27] <YamadaZero> Beast mode = Brock Lesnar Mode
[0:06:31] <+xeros720> i expect no less for woolie
[0:06:46] <+canseesea> I only found out the yakuza team made BD like two days ago, and I've seen that fact five times since
[0:06:47] <%Exiliator> Wooaah? no wayy
[0:06:49] <+xeros720> it's a good move
[0:06:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 4Head
[0:06:59] <EX_shuffle> why. WHY
[0:07:00] <DatAsuna> you will

[0:07:11] <TheHeroAppears> it's pretty cool
[0:07:17] <Haarute> i can't wait for the beast grab heat move on a single dude that's like my favorite
[0:07:22] <+b_aleph> No, I use X X Y, beast lariat is dope
[0:07:26] <+johnnychopsocky> Which one?
[0:07:27] <scrublord009> SHAKEDOWN EVOLUTION
[0:07:31] <+Orrjekt> What are the odds that Woolie becomes a real estate tycoon tonight?
[0:07:31] <%WritebroAlpha> @Haarute the face dunk? Woolie's gonna nut
[0:07:34] <@akuda_bar> you will be sucked
[0:07:34] <%Feralspirit41> Downloaded, not like cyberpunk
[0:07:38] <+BaekTheHeck> im baby so yeah xxxxyy is my lifeline
[0:07:45] <+mundanelotus> Heat moves make the combat worth it
[0:07:48] <+johnnychopsocky> Because Beast is an embarrassment of throw riches
[0:07:51] <Haarute> the fucking beast dunk is so stupid i love it
[0:08:00] <DatAsuna> I love brawler
[0:08:10] <%Exiliator> I heard Tachibana hangs out at the shogi place, go back there again Kappa
[0:08:14] <DatAsuna> being able to just power through stagger is the best
[0:08:17] <+johnnychopsocky> I'm partial to the Shoulder Shatter Counter he gets
[0:08:20] <Darren716> Man Woolie is gonna bust a nut at tiger drop
[0:08:20] <+Orrjekt> The Resolute Counter is where its at
[0:08:31] <@Menitta> I really like how Brawler is a much looser interpretation of Kiryu's later fighting style
[0:08:37] <DatAsuna> same
[0:08:42] <+SunnyVarietyPack> ☻
[0:08:47] <+SunnyVarietyPack> ♠♣♦•◘○
[0:08:53] <+johnnychopsocky> my biggest criticism of Yak LAD is 'no Tiger Drop'
[0:08:56] <DatAsuna> I gotta say, overall I don't actually like style switching for kiryu though
[0:08:58] <+Orrjekt> @Menitta Kiryu's unrefined style
[0:09:08] <DatAsuna> Majima's style switching works better on him i think
[0:09:10] <jinzerox2> have they used THE beast heat moves yet?
[0:09:13] <+patriotrenegade> Guys the McRib is back
[0:09:14] <%nabby1> Im here for cyberpunk?
[0:09:14] <brunoberserk> woolie is not a big fan of using heat moves, huh ?
[0:09:20] <@Solidus_113> the multi-hit one
[0:09:20] <+SunnyVarietyPack> ohh there is tiiger dropping in LAD
[0:09:25] <%nabby1> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN

[0:09:45] <+Orrjekt> Whoa.. How did he talk with clue context like that?!
[0:09:51] <+patriotrenegade> Beast style carried me through 0 and Kiwami. It’s unstoppable.
[0:09:53] <DSD24> Oh man I love when my dialogue is in a different color
[0:09:59] <jinzerox2> finding new heat moves is a part of the fun of this game
[0:10:06] <%solracc25> woolieS woolieT woolieU woolieF
[0:10:16] <+johnnychopsocky> Also best Heat Counter is the Rush one against the wall
[0:10:17] <Solidnick18> it's where you go play bowling
[0:10:27] <%condemned_15> NotLikeThis m64Bummed
[0:10:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Man after playing a bunch of these games it’s fun when you memorize the map
[0:10:34] <+Nero_Cross> I wish people said the important details in a different color irl
[0:10:49] <DSD24> @doomerskeletor13 I always like that feeling!
[0:10:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you will remember Kamurocho because most of the games are in this map
[0:10:59] <%solracc25> Did woolie max bowling?
[0:11:06] <@Solidus_113> The Yakuza crime meter LUL
[0:11:08] <jinzerox2> @johnnychopsocky he has to unlock it in the sphere grid i think

[0:11:17] <DSD24> @Nero_Cross I guess a example would be a teacher going "This is gonna be on the test"
[0:11:19] <+AsinPersuasion> is v also a yakuza lore master?
[0:11:25] <Winner_92> Crime Ryu Must Stop the Crime Meter From Rising
[0:11:25] <+SunnyVarietyPack> no
[0:11:35] <+johnnychopsocky> I know. I'm looking forward to him finding out how hype Rush can get
[0:11:43] <EX_shuffle> hell with that, I'm gonna go commit my own crimes
[0:11:49] <DSD24> Look at Kiryu barely out of frame
[0:12:00] <jinzerox2> @AsinPersuasion V mention he has played 0, Kiwami 1 & 2
[0:12:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What do you mean chased you out? Do you not have the location anymore?

[0:17:52] <MyNameIsRasus> HOBOLORDS
[0:17:53] <+RowenCleric> or I wish the video game kid was him
[0:17:53] <DSD24> Its way too early for Ichiban
[0:17:53] <Edjager97> yep
[0:17:56] <%WritebroAlpha> What time is it? It's ODA time.
[0:18:02] <+doctordunno> Ichiban's about kiryu's age, right?
[0:18:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Arch Vagrants
[0:18:05] <+johnnychopsocky> @austinj24 No greater rivalry in games
[0:18:07] <%WritebroAlpha> Looks like it's all ODA for this business.
[0:18:09] <+doctordunno> Or is he younger?
[0:18:10] <+RandoChris> Squatty hobos
[0:18:15] <%solracc25> It's the mystic homeless
[0:18:15] <Komayeda> Ichiban's like 42 or so
[0:18:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Kaiser Drifters
[0:18:18] <+RowenCleric> Ichiban is ike 15ish years younger?
[0:18:19] <CrazyMedicine> ichi is younger
[0:18:20] <+SunnyVarietyPack> ichiban is 10 years younger
[0:18:21] <Winner_92> ok, thanks

[0:18:35] <Komayeda> Yeah, pretty much
[0:18:36] <@Solidus_113> dayo
[0:18:40] <Darren716> Ichi would be like 8 when this is going down
[0:18:43] <+SunnyVarietyPack> kiryu is 50 in LAD
[0:18:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Ichiban is 40ish in 2019
[0:18:52] <+SunnyVarietyPack> 52
[0:18:53] <+MajorCrasher> 43
[0:18:56] <+SunnyVarietyPack> 42
[0:19:03] <%Feralspirit41> Kiryu is the most polite criminal ever
[0:19:03] <+CptBritches> 98
[0:19:08] <@akuda_bar> 69
[0:19:09] <velgaduere> in Yakuza 8, the tables turn; the player character is the only "I'LL KILL YOU" guy left in Japan, terrorizing his way to the top
[0:19:09] <MyNameIsRasus> bingo
[0:19:10] <+RowenCleric> so Ichiban would be 10 and at the Soap Land right now
[0:19:11] <+doctordunno> Ain't nobody closing a door on kiryu
[0:19:20] <brunoberserk> essence of the '' foot in door ''
[0:19:25] <Mr_Strut> Just mount spikes on your doorframe
[0:19:25] <+CptBritches> The powerful foot step
[0:19:26] <+Getter404> He's 38 as of 2006 (As said explicitly in Kiwami 2), so work from there I guess
[0:19:28] <+canseesea> I saw a guy try to hold a door closed on Kiryu once. I'm not sure he landed yet

[0:27:37] <%Feralspirit41> hes a giant
[0:27:40] <+egalitarian696969> thank you woolie for being one of the only people not streaming cyberpunk while i wait for patches
[0:27:42] <%WritebroAlpha> @tomahank18 Kiryu is 6ft / 187ish cm in 80s Japan
[0:27:46] <%HedgehogGames1> Kiryu is 6' big by Japanese standards
[0:27:47] <%MonsterEnvy> Kiryu is 6'0
[0:27:48] <+canseesea> Kiryu is definitely taller than average, but a few people tower over him in the series
[0:27:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:27:50] <MyNameIsRasus> So just did the math, inflation adds about 20% to that 60k in today's money
[0:27:50] <+loukemia83> Kiryu is 6ft in a land of 5'10 japanese
[0:27:51] <+Deko_> LUL
[0:27:52] <tomahank18> Shot im taller than Kiryu
[0:27:57] <NotHereToStream> tachibana has that google doc ready
[0:27:59] <%MonsterEnvy> This guy is sitting down too
[0:27:59] <+skyheys> If I had a penny every time Kiryu said "Nani...?"
[0:28:00] <%WritebroAlpha> Me too lel
[0:28:00] <$Superdandy96> Hmmmm
[0:28:02] <tomahank18> But still, super tall
[0:28:12] <%WritebroAlpha> @skyheys you would have many pennies
[0:28:14] <+doctordunno> I feel like kiryu grows in later games
[0:28:16] <tomahank18> Built like a brick shithouse too

[0:28:46] <+johnnychopsocky> oh man Woolie don't know about the Kamurocho homeless
[0:28:47] <$Invlux> UNITE SQUAT
[0:28:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Honestly, if you want underground info, Homeless and the drifters are a great source of info
[0:28:53] <tomahank18> That explains why people are always finding him in random encounters. They can just see him xoming
[0:28:53] <Lieutenant_America> Just like Discworld
[0:28:54] <chhdez> Hobos are the sharks of nature
[0:28:54] <Oxybe> The homeless are the true zanbatsu

[0:34:12] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Try brawler style with the XXY combo
[0:34:13] <$Superdandy96> No sleeping Woolz!

[0:34:19] <tomahank18> Woolie no!
[0:34:25] <+Wechman23> use weapon heat attacks
[0:34:28] <%big_laser_boss> That stomp does so much damage in Hard mode
[0:34:42] <Edjager97> USE THE SWORD heat attack
[0:34:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:34:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> bait his hard swings
[0:34:57] <tomahank18> Kiryu should just hit shakedown with a truck or some shit
[0:34:58] <+b_aleph> @Edjager97 that's majima only
[0:34:58] <%r0chelimit> Use the bowling ball! It has a heat move at range!
[0:35:02] <+MajorCrasher> use the wall heat move
[0:35:05] <a_mad_dragon> gotta dark souls this guy
[0:35:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> panic LUL
[0:35:09] <Solidnick18> yeah that thing is tricky

[0:35:12] <WG101> NO GREED
[0:35:15] <Mr_Strut> Get shook
[0:35:19] <%big_laser_boss> Abuse the I-frames from doging
[0:35:19] <+kewlmyc> DID HE JUST USE AN EMPEROR
[0:35:21] <Solidnick18> the kick just knocks down
[0:35:22] <%WritebroAlpha> Bowling ball heat move!
[0:35:24] <tomahank18> Use a heat move with a garbage truck where you throw his ass in the crusher
[0:35:25] <%Feralspirit41> DID DARK SOULS TEACH YOU NOTHING
[0:35:25] <$Superdandy96> @tomahank18 but what if mr shakedown just laughs off the truck?
[0:35:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Try brawler
[0:35:28] <%jiggy_snipe> Shakedown Souls
[0:35:31] <tanarath> Got greedy
[0:35:34] <Edjager97> @b_aleph doesn't kiriyu have heat attacks with the washizaki as well?
[0:35:38] <@Solidus_113> having heat still boosts attack speed and damage @WoolieVersus
[0:35:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> drop your shield Woolz
[0:35:49] <Edjager97> @b_aleph I remember him being able to do heat with other weapons also.
[0:35:53] <Solidnick18> when he does the big wind up it's safe
[0:35:53] <cipher758> beatdown
[0:35:56] <%sillyschlub> use a little health - uses the emperor Kappa
[0:35:58] <+RealThiele> that lady on the sidelines is HYPED
[0:35:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> BEASTO
[0:36:25] <President_valentine> You can get the money back when he beats you
[0:36:27] <brianthe12th> use the golden bowling ball to smash his shin bones
[0:36:34] <%teh_rawk> woolie grinding on screen
[0:36:34] <Edjager97> in hindsight it's much better to fight mr Shakedown with Majima. his weapon style is very useful for that as well as his original base style once severely upgraded
[0:36:35] <%r0chelimit> And the grab
[0:36:41] <%big_laser_boss> or just take the loss. losing to him is nothin when you can take it back
[0:36:43] <ArcaneMusic> Mr Shakedown pops his heat move, commiting tax fraud on everyone in a 6 MILE RADIUS
[0:36:43] <Solidnick18> almost
[0:36:47] <tomahank18> I was watching God of Highschool yesterday, this crowd is very god of highschool level
[0:36:49] <%Feralspirit41> Nearly there
[0:37:00] <%mr_miyagucci> I think you can loop him with beast grab after knocking him down

[0:37:51] <+b_aleph> @Edjager97 he wasn't able to do it with the photon sword, so I guess you're misremembreing it. Cause I'm pretty sure he can't do it with the tonfas either
[0:37:53] <%doomerskeletor13> STONKS

[0:38:25] <%Exiliator> You literally were!

[0:38:25] <+AbnormalVoid> 🤔
[0:38:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> KIRYU KEARNS A LESSON
[0:38:27] <velgaduere> INTROSPECTION
[0:38:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> learns
[0:38:36] <jinzerox2> @Edjager97 there is no heat move for the sword weapon type. Tonfa heat move only in Majima style
[0:38:37] <+guynormus69> are we the baddies?
[0:38:38] <%Javaa01> Money was the True Heart of Battle all along
[0:38:38] <AngryAsian5> Kiryu needs to learn the meaning of true fighting spirit LUL
[0:38:43] <%big_laser_boss> mushroom guy
[0:38:43] <BlackDae> maybe you're the shakedown
[0:38:50] <Raishiro> alright now go lose to shakedown and give him all of that
[0:38:51] <%teh_rawk> money is leterally free in thisa game
[0:38:55] <notsoy> each "level" of shakedown carries more and more money
[0:38:57] <+QueequegTheater> Now to spend five minutes obsessing over which upgrade only for Woolie to go with his original choice Kappa
[0:38:58] <+xeros720> embrace your inner shakedown
[0:38:59] <ArcaneMusic> The real shakedown was the friends we made along the way
[0:39:03] <MyNameIsRasus> It's literal free real estate
[0:39:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is the one Yakuza game where money is a joke
[0:39:14] <+QueequegTheater> IT DOES
[0:39:15] <%Feralspirit41> Dont worry money your money is all that money
[0:39:25] <rosemon5001> shakedowns money increases whit every defeat of him or his shakedown of you
[0:39:30] <dan_g_v> pocket change
[0:39:35] <a_mad_dragon> basically a million dollars
[0:39:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> which is small sum considering endgame money lol
[0:39:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu is just eating money
[0:39:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Money literally spews out of the orifices of every single enemy
[0:39:49] <Darren716> You got a free one on the right
[0:39:51] <%Javaa01> Take the cheap 2mil upgrade from the top branch
[0:40:07] <jinzerox2> Blue Sphere for new heat moves, usually
[0:40:20] <+b_aleph> @dan_g_v SHSHSHAAAA
[0:40:29] <notsoy> golden fist is super good
[0:40:47] <+guynormus69> consume the currency
[0:40:58] <%big_laser_boss> there is a compo upgrade where the money you take from shakedown gets multiplied by 1.6. This makes it possible to almost double your money by intentionally losing to him first then take it back
[0:41:02] <spawnzie> nice
[0:41:13] <$NitronStreams> EAT THE MONEY!
[0:41:15] <%cache_22> Huh, Funimation/Sony just bought Crunchyroll.
[0:41:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yup
[0:41:27] <cipher758> consume currency
[0:41:29] <+QueequegTheater> @cache_22 excuse me wha
[0:41:32] <+QueequegTheater> what
[0:41:40] <%Indigo_Automaton> Imagine how powerful Jeff Bezos must be in Yakuza World
[0:41:42] <%Feralspirit41> Inject the money directly into the vein
[0:41:44] <chhdez> Confirmed buy?
[0:41:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:41:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> The purchase hasn't been confirmed, but it's in the works. @QueequegTheater

[0:42:34] <Solidnick18> i mean yes
[0:42:37] <KaiserMario> More like a Royal Release, rather than just a parry...
[0:42:38] <WG101> Kitty Setdown
[0:42:44] <%WritebroAlpha> Brawler is the prototype version of Kiryu's main style throughout the series
[0:42:45] <penitentpendant> Build with Rush, Spend with Brawl
[0:42:50] <MyNameIsRasus> N U T
[0:42:53] <SomeOtherNeb> brawler near a bicycle is a fight ender in 5 seconds
[0:42:55] <%big_laser_boss> @Javaa01 no, that's counter hook
[0:42:57] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus One of brawler's final upgrades literally doubles your damage while drunk, BTW
[0:42:58] <%notmicrowavesafe> nut
[0:43:02] <%WritebroAlpha> BOWLING BALL
[0:43:02] <Solidnick18> use the fan
[0:43:13] <$Superdandy96> Brawler is my favorite honestly. It’s just a good well-rounder fight style
[0:43:13] <@Solidus_113> bowling ball has a good heat move
[0:43:16] <MyNameIsRasus> fan heat move is great if i recall
[0:43:17] <%big_laser_boss> mushroom guy
[0:43:18] <jinzerox2> @SomeOtherNeb I think beast end it fast
[0:43:19] <notsoy> the stun gun and bowling balls have great heat moves
[0:43:23] <@Solidus_113> 8
[0:43:30] <Kiraklene> 8
[0:43:49] <MyNameIsRasus> 8
[0:43:50] <SomeOtherNeb> @jinzerox2 ah man I haven't played it in a while, I got the names confused, I was thinking of beast
[0:43:52] <%solracc25> To the homeless!

[0:44:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> V are you alright?
[0:44:21] <+kewlmyc> Did V just have a stroke?
[0:44:25] <velgaduere> sometimes you just gotta have a stroke
[0:44:26] <+skyheys> V is buffering
[0:44:29] <+QueequegTheater> Does V smell burning toast
[0:44:31] <ruggles322> We are sooo close
[0:44:31] <+CptBritches> V going full hobo speak
[0:44:34] <SomeOtherNeb> ah, Homeless Man Zero begins
[0:44:47] <brachydios777> Woolie sounded like the booty warrior
[0:44:48] <MyNameIsRasus> flauting cash on taxis will be relevant later
[0:45:04] <%big_laser_boss> @Solidus_113 Can't wait to see Woolie's surprise when he learns what the quick-change clothes actually do
[0:45:05] <DatAsuna> and for eating
[0:45:13] <rosemon5001> ye taxi cp is great you can abuse the taxi one quickly
[0:45:14] <brachydios777> EAT EVERYTHING
[0:45:20] <%Exiliator> Eat eat eat
[0:45:24] <velgaduere> EAT KAMUROCHO
[0:45:25] <%doomerskeletor13> The Completion List is huge
[0:45:31] <Brunty023> EAT THE MENUS
[0:45:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do EVERYTHING hundreds of times.
[0:45:34] <penitentpendant> "Do everything and be rewarded for doing everything."
[0:45:41] <%big_laser_boss> kareoke
[0:45:41] <+QueequegTheater> Not much though
[0:45:53] <DatAsuna> you run fairly slow in this game and it dodges random fights
[0:46:03] <MyNameIsRasus> man i fucking love spiderman
[0:46:05] <T_Sasquatch> Me TOO
[0:46:07] <KaironFortressKnight> Shocked
[0:46:09] <mortificent> OF COURSE
[0:46:11] <+QueequegTheater> Cartoon costume though
[0:46:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Spider-Punk is Greeeeat
[0:46:19] <+kewlmyc> Sadly, those scenes don't exist in the PS5 edition of Miles Morales due to SSD
[0:46:21] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Post game, not NG+
[0:46:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> 2099 Alt version is great
[0:46:24] <T_Sasquatch> I don't know why i loved it much more than everything else
[0:46:27] <brachydios777> “Surprising”
[0:46:29] <Ookamiden02> THe Kamen Rider one in the new game is the coolest
[0:46:29] <DatAsuna> half of them would be spoilers anyway at this point
[0:46:33] <T_Sasquatch> The jean jacket is rad
[0:46:34] <ZeeJiggle> Ye I wish Yakuza let you change costumes normally, might be my biggest gripe lol
[0:46:34] <+canseesea> the cel shaded costume was my favorite because comic book games should look like danged comic books now off my lawn
[0:46:42] <%Ecchigun> woolieFUN
[0:46:47] <MyNameIsRasus> i too am unemployed
[0:46:48] <%Exiliator> Homeless in japan have it rough, I mean homeless everywere also have it rought but
[0:46:57] <brachydios777> I love the Spiderman the end costume with the jacket
[0:47:01] <%Ecchigun> this haircut
[0:47:04] <Mahbonk> sadly all games needs you to get to New Game + for costumes
[0:47:06] <RetroCop87> @WoolieVersus in Yakuza games, the homeless are the equivalent of the village hidden in the sand
[0:47:12] <KaironFortressKnight> Hello PS2 hair
[0:47:13] <Darren716> Hey Woolie like the Don Qui?
[0:47:13] <+xeros720> kiryu refuses to fight women
[0:47:15] <chhdez> Ah yes, the fancy hobos
[0:47:16] <%Ecchigun> cant get a job with this haircut
[0:47:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Kiryu loves The Noble Homeless
[0:47:29] <+guynormus69> HOMELESS MEN [Outcasts of Society]
[0:47:36] <@Solidus_113> oh god
[0:47:36] <KaironFortressKnight> GET THE NOTEPAD
[0:47:45] <chhdez> With most refined tastes
[0:47:48] <%doomerskeletor13> This series is actually extremely kind to the homeless most of the time
[0:47:49] <%Feralspirit41> That was easy
[0:47:50] <+QueequegTheater> @KaironFortressKnight he has chat for that
[0:48:05] <+xeros720> i'm still trying to understand that japanese film trope of the noble homeless men
[0:48:07] <@akuda_bar> i've always loved yakuza's depiction of homeless people
[0:48:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> KAAA CHII
[0:48:10] <spawnzie> Kaaaaachi
[0:48:12] <audibleellipsis> KAAA chi

[0:48:29] <+xeros720> oh god, let him get the list
[0:48:30] <Mr_Strut> Beggars CAN be choosers!
[0:48:31] <%WritebroAlpha> 1) Sake
[0:48:32] <+Goblin01> this is a good one to just figure out where to find it
[0:48:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza loves fetch quests like this LUL
[0:48:35] <%toastybites> when someone offers you better milk the shit out of it, especially if you're homeless
[0:48:36] <+guynormus69> get the expensive champagne for a cheevo
[0:48:36] <%big_laser_boss> you can buy 200 dollars worth of champagne
[0:48:36] <ZeeJiggle> Hey, if someone's gonna get you stuff, may as well get the good shit
[0:48:49] <jinzerox2> there is a Achievement if you give him the GOLD Champagne though
[0:48:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:48:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> Gaskwah
[0:48:59] <@akuda_bar> that's super cute lol
[0:49:00] <Mahbonk> PogChamp agne
[0:49:12] <@akuda_bar> he wants to be a part of christmas BibleThump
[0:49:17] <doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah Yakuza is almost always set during Christmas time
[0:49:19] <%WritebroAlpha> Make sure to give him the gold champagne, not the normal one. Get that cheevo.
[0:49:27] <%Feralspirit41> What yakuza game doesnt take place at or near christmas
[0:49:35] <chhdez> HEY BOY
[0:49:39] <islandoasis> who is on the couch?
[0:49:41] <Mahbonk> Yakuza is the ultimate Christmas game about familly
[0:49:45] <@akuda_bar> @islandoasis LittleV
[0:49:47] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s at least one game I remember that’s in like spring or something
[0:49:49] <%notmicrowavesafe> Islays bb
[0:49:49] <Mr_Strut> I wish one of these guys was Bacchus
[0:49:50] <RetroCop87> MAPLE
[0:49:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus You ever have Suntory Japanese whiskey? its gooood
[0:49:55] <chhdez> Oh BOY
[0:49:58] <+QueequegTheater> Japanese whisky isn't whisky
[0:50:05] <PettyFunk> Note that it’s spelled “whisky” and not “whiskey”. Only scotch and Japanese whisky follow this rule.
[0:50:09] <BlackDae> remember when zap branagin's VA read donald trump's quotes and it sounded very in charecter
[0:50:10] <+CptBritches> For good times, make it Suntory times
[0:50:11] <+QueequegTheater> It needs to be from Scotland or Ireland
[0:50:14] <damienlunas> V do you like Umeshuu? Plum Wine?
[0:50:15] <RetroCop87> it's fine in mdoeration
[0:50:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> Suntory Yamazaki Kreygasm
[0:50:21] <%WritebroAlpha> Umeshuu fucking rules
[0:50:24] <PettyFunk> Japanese whisky is similar to some single malt highland Scotch whisky.
[0:50:25] <+OmegaWeltall> Tsuntori is prettygood
[0:50:29] <+OmegaWeltall> er Suntori
[0:50:31] <+xeros720> my local place had the yamazakis, good stuff
[0:50:34] <%Ecchigun> Japanese whisky is like going for the smoothest slice with a sharpness of a sword in your throat.
[0:50:39] <OldManDeckardCain> beer is malt
[0:50:40] <islandoasis> oh the heavy metal covers guy
[0:50:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oolong Tea is my vice though, can down that super easy.
[0:50:48] <RetroCop87> Fireball mixed with cream soda, apple cider, or egg nog
[0:50:52] <+xeros720> jp alcohol tends to be very smooth, it's nice
[0:50:57] <%notmicrowavesafe> Lagavulin all day every day

[0:53:12] <PettyFunk> @writebroalpha A couple friends of mine work in meaderies! Once you get an operation running it’s apparently very easy to brew, and infusing it with various flavors is very user friendly. :)

[0:53:33] <+skyheys> HOW
[0:53:34] <niddron> @queequegtheater just say you got the CP from the homeless man
[0:53:35] <%toastybites> People have been trying to shorten Cyberpunk 2077 to CP and I hate it
[0:53:38] <$Superdandy96> WOOF
[0:53:40] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus He'll also need the donkey
[0:53:46] <%Double_Tap_That> You mean orange?
[0:53:57] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus kakubin
[0:53:57] <%WritebroAlpha> @PettyFunk That sounds sick! I've been getting into a nice honey one recently but with THE RONA I've barely drank at all this year.
[0:53:59] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m so used to the Dragon Engine where you can just go into interiors without loading
[0:54:18] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You can pick up the scotch here too
[0:54:20] <Mr_Strut> Friendship!

[0:54:29] <President_valentine> Friendship unlocked
[0:54:32] <%nodnerbuil> didn't you just pick up a Miho Card?
[0:54:34] <Mahbonk> time to build some more confidence
[0:54:36] <%nodnerbuil> is this the chick?
[0:54:36] <jinzerox2> hey, it another JAV actress xD

[0:55:05] <$Superdandy96> Okay, I just wanna ask this to see if there is anyone else in the chat is into it, but does anyone else kinda want a Kamen Rider game that plays like Yakuza?
[0:55:06] <Prevot> AMERICAN TASTEFOOD
[0:55:07] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m like 90% sure this game has Mt Dew in it
[0:55:09] <PettyFunk> @writebroalpha Fun fact, the word “mead” literally means honey and is older than the word honey. It’s also believed to be possibly the first alcohol developed by humans!
[0:55:15] <niddron> Wish I had that IRL
[0:55:25] <%solracc25> bidness
[0:55:35] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Buy the Kakubin, it counts as scotch
[0:55:39] <%WritebroAlpha> @PettyFunk I knew that! It was also the traditional drink for weddings and is where the word "honeymoon" originates from.
[0:55:43] <%TheGohanSkywalker> Pretty much every woman with a non-generic face is played by a current/former JAV actress in this game.
[0:55:44] <%Exiliator> cheevo!
[0:55:46] <KaironFortressKnight> Pfffft
[0:55:47] <ArcaneMusic> Oh no...
[0:55:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah some of the substories are pretty tame/wholesome

[0:56:37] <Darren716> I forgot about k-fed

[0:56:50] <CrimsonFox777> Oh boy, do I love Cheese Pizza. Kappa
[0:56:50] <notsoy> lol i want to see woolie play like half of the game's substories, they're so silly
[0:56:51] <PettyFunk> @writebroalpha :) Big ups for appreciating an often overlooked beverage!
[0:56:51] <niddron> are you making up things again Woolie?
[0:56:55] <KaiserMario> "Big booty"
[0:56:57] <Darren716> Remember when K-Fed fought John Cena?
[0:57:00] <$Superdandy96> ...
[0:57:02] <+xeros720> can't believe we get to watch Woolie age into dust before our eyes
[0:57:03] <%doomerskeletor13> I have no idea what he’s talking about LUL
[0:57:05] <ArcaneMusic> What next? You gonna get some CP from the Pro Melee player Substory?
[0:57:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> AHHHHHH
[0:57:18] <Vashido22> @ArcaneMusic jesus lmao
[0:57:23] <Mr_Strut> This man will NOT be your friend
[0:57:24] <OldManDeckardCain> ???
[0:57:29] <$Superdandy96> God I hope Woolie goes down to pink street sometime.
[0:57:38] <notsoy> BTW you can buy whisky and drink it for yourself, being drunk makes you get into fights more but boosts heat gains
[0:57:41] <PettyFunk> The best part of single-malt Scotch is learning which region you like the most. :)
[0:57:42] <+QueequegTheater> No, he's not played by a porn actress
[0:57:47] <President_valentine> not important enough
[0:57:48] <%WritebroAlpha> @PettyFunk I got into it by chance; some friends of mine and I were trying out a new game at our board game night, a King Arthur themed thing, and I grabbed it because it seemed on-brand. Never looked back.
[0:57:49] <jinzerox2> batting cage
[0:57:59] <Lophostrix_> wait, miho is a porn actress?
[0:58:00] <%Javaa01> Boozing up on convenience store liquor only juices up your heat and gets you drunk
[0:58:02] <Mr_Strut> YES IT IS
[0:58:04] <President_valentine> yup
[0:58:16] <+guynormus69> next time you go to a convenience store check out the magazines
[0:58:16] <MyNameIsRasus> List<Cheats> littleVCellphone
[0:58:20] <islandoasis> Thank you for your patronage! [CRASH] I AM THOU AND THOU ART !
[0:58:22] <+MrBaldachin> @Lophostrix_ a lot of the way too well modelled female characters are
[0:58:23] <notsoy> every sidestory girl in this game except 1 is a JAV idol
[0:58:25] <Prevot> isn't mojo the one in the card woolie just found
[0:58:30] <Prevot> miho
[0:58:39] <islandoasis> 7/11 social links
[0:58:46] <jinzerox2> @Lophostrix_ her full name is Miho Tono, google it xD
[0:58:51] <+QueequegTheater> he's fine
[0:58:52] <$Superdandy96> @notsoy huh, I didn’t know that. TIL
[0:58:53] <PettyFunk> @notsoy JAV and idol are kinda mutually exclusive...
[0:58:59] <President_valentine> ded
[0:59:11] <+xeros720> jav actresses, whichever
[0:59:13] <+QueequegTheater> @PettyFunk not idol, JAV idol
[0:59:21] <%TheGohanSkywalker> @pettyfunk I mean, another name for JAV actress is "gravure idol"
[0:59:33] <TopLeftCenter> Side dodges and back dodges give you different dodge attacks
[0:59:34] <Lophostrix_> @jinzerox2 arigatou
[0:59:35] <Darren716> Nah gravure is a bit different
[0:59:37] <rReizs> actually not surprisingly, some actually are both
[0:59:38] <+QueequegTheater> No, gravure is definitely a different thing
[0:59:40] <Vashido22> This game introduced me to some uh....good stuff
[0:59:43] <islandoasis> I cant believe that every female va in Sonic Forces was a Jav actor
[0:59:43] <Darren716> Gravure doesn't have nudity
[0:59:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> I thought gravue is just softcore stuff
[0:59:47] <islandoasis> even shadow
[0:59:49] <brianthe12th> you can pick up motorcycles and electric generators in beast mode and smash em on dudes
[0:59:53] <PettyFunk> Right right haha, I was thinking idol industry and their weirdly suggestive-but-TOTALLY-ASEXUAL press
[0:59:54] <brianthe12th> its very satisfying
[1:00:00] <KaironFortressKnight> Mmm heated sake
[1:00:00] <+zyberion626> gravure is skimpy, teasing stuff. No actual porn
[1:00:01] <CrimsonFox777> You technically can wait in a line in Pokemon Black/White.
[1:00:03] <RetroCop87> waiting in a line to find a sailor
[1:00:24] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Has he gone to Pink Alley yet
[1:00:25] <fuji_92> "next cp was 8" monkaS
[1:00:27] <Prevot> "the next CP was 8" oof
[1:00:33] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s gonna say CP the whole game isn’t he
[1:00:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> I hate yall lmfao
[1:00:44] <WG101> GO HOME
[1:00:46] <%Exiliator> PogChamp
[1:00:48] <%TheGohanSkywalker> Okay but why tho?
[1:00:50] <+Wechman23> what is that for?
[1:00:55] <jinzerox2> there is not there though
[1:00:56] <LittleWulfie> I don't think there's a reason though
[1:00:56] <Mr_Strut> Just hang out at home
[1:01:01] <%doomerskeletor13> I had no idea you could do that
[1:01:02] <jinzerox2> nothing there
[1:01:04] <islandoasis> Dont bring the cp home woolie...
[1:01:05] <%RyTYoung> yeah
[1:01:06] <Mr_Strut> Quarantine
[1:01:10] <velgaduere> @FuqBoiSlim don't blame chat, there's too much CP in this game to ignore
[1:01:11] <KaironFortressKnight> I think its to change to day? Im not sure
[1:01:14] <$Invlux> change the time of day
[1:01:20] <+QueequegTheater> You can't change clothes until postgame
[1:01:23] <Darren716> You can't
[1:01:24] <%Kriss1827> maybe change time of day?
[1:01:24] <%doomerskeletor13> I’ve played through this game twice and I’ve never seen that
[1:01:24] <Jalexster> There's no good reason why there WOULDN'T be a go home option
[1:01:25] <+BaekTheHeck> you can't change clothes
[1:01:28] <@Solidus_113> It's only NG+
[1:01:29] <jinzerox2> nope
[1:01:31] <LittleWulfie> No, premium adventure
[1:01:31] <%big_laser_boss> You can't
[1:01:32] <President_valentine> no new game plus
[1:01:33] <MyNameIsRasus> You can't
[1:01:36] <+kewlmyc> Changing clothes is NG+ only
[1:01:37] <%HedgehogGames1> Can't change clothes
[1:01:38] <CrimsonCore90> Walking home changes day night cycle
[1:01:40] <%TheGohanSkywalker> Clothing can't change until you beat the game
[1:01:41] <jinzerox2> hey gacha
[1:01:41] <%Javaa01> Clothes changes are absolutely postgame
[1:01:43] <T_Sasquatch> Yosh
[1:01:44] <Jalexster> I mean, they did model an apartment for Kiryu, so why not allow the player to check it out?
[1:01:47] <$Superdandy96> NG+ only unfortunatly
[1:02:05] <%Puhff> Woolie and V experimenting?! My fanfic is becoming real....
[1:02:08] <MyNameIsRasus> he IS a kid
[1:02:09] <Mr_Strut> ok boomer
[1:02:12] <+QueequegTheater> It's Bud Lite
[1:02:13] <Lieutenant_America> I PREFER weak beer
[1:02:27] <Lieutenant_America> Mom is disappointed in my beer preferences...
[1:02:30] <mortificent> German beer tho is super good
[1:02:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Lieutenant_America I am dissapointed in your beer preferences.
[1:02:50] <Mr_Strut> Just drink
[1:02:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:02:52] <+QueequegTheater> Hey, there's good American beer, it's just that all the commercials are for light garbage
[1:03:02] <+BlockingDisabled> I don't drink alcohol at all lol
[1:03:04] <%Exiliator> Good ole japanese drinking culture pressure...
[1:03:07] <Zuzu_Pachulia> looked it up, Suntory Malt's beer is 5%, so not as bad as some
[1:03:07] <$Superdandy96> I need to get adjusted to room temp beer. I’m so used to it being cold that drinking it warm is weird.
[1:03:07] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:03:11] <spawnzie> He's amready a hobo woolie
[1:03:11] <penitentpendant> Canceled... TO THE GRAVE
[1:03:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Hobo is the apex canceled
[1:03:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> Hobo cancel sounds like some cheap janky ass fighting move
[1:03:14] <%WritebroAlpha> @PettyFunk I've been racking my brains for like the last 10 minutes trying to remember the brand I drink and I've just googled it. Moniack mead! It's good stuff.
[1:03:20] <velgaduere> you can cancel... his clothes?
[1:03:21] <Mr_Strut> Maybe that's why he's homeless
[1:03:23] <+johnnychopsocky> get that homeless guy some Certified Evil. 9.1% ABV
[1:03:25] <velgaduere> nah...
[1:03:25] <MyNameIsRasus> AND THIS
[1:03:26] <+Psitterrific> Oh hey... a thing to watch that makes my frantic pre lock down running around less awful.
[1:03:31] <MyNameIsRasus> IS TO CANCEL EVEN FURTHER BEYOND
[1:03:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's homeless, why SHOULDN'T he drink the whole bottle?
[1:03:35] <+twohitgood> it's only a fifth
[1:03:41] <+johnnychopsocky> Strong ass beer
[1:03:43] <Darren716> One guy just got a can
[1:03:43] <JetpackMcQuack> he's new here
[1:03:48] <%notmicrowavesafe> @superdandy96 wait what? why room temp
[1:03:52] <KaironFortressKnight> Sake fucks me up every time
[1:03:57] <KaironFortressKnight> I find it so deceptive
[1:04:01] <WG101> but kiryu never killed a man
[1:04:03] <velgaduere> you fool
[1:04:06] <Mr_Strut> WHY
[1:04:09] <dan_g_v> a forty of a crack
[1:04:10] <RetroCop87> Santilis is the best American beer
[1:04:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> @johnnychopsocky or some "Sit down or i'll sit you down" 10% beer techinically a wheat wine
[1:04:15] <BlackDae> he got a single beer lol
[1:04:19] <%jiggy_snipe> of course
[1:04:19] <JetpackMcQuack> why not
[1:04:20] <Mr_Strut> oh
[1:04:21] <CappuccinoGuil> fAIR

[1:04:29] <damienlunas> Hobo Cancel sounds like the name of a fighting game tech discovered by someone whose username contained "hobo"
[1:04:31] <President_valentine> that makes sense
[1:04:40] <MyNameIsRasus> man I feel like such a loser for not being able to drink
[1:04:43] <%WritebroAlpha> If we're talking beer, I prefer a real ale. Gimme that 4-6% good shit
[1:04:44] <%notmicrowavesafe> Tequila still gives me bad flashbacks
[1:04:44] <velgaduere> I mean it's true, I remember drinking several four lokos back to back at that age
[1:04:48] <KaironFortressKnight> LIVER BLOW
[1:04:53] <$Superdandy96> @notmicrowavesafe I’m planning to go to Germany to visit some friends, after the dark times of course. And he told me beer over there is room temp usual. Unless he just lied to my face to make me look like a fool, which would be normal.
[1:04:59] <velgaduere> you're invincible for about a year or two
[1:05:01] <President_valentine> @mynameisrasus don't its not really anything special
[1:05:04] <%p4ntless> I drank most of a fifth of whiskey one time in college and passed the fuck out on my porch and almost set myself on fire, do not recommend
[1:05:15] <+johnnychopsocky> @doc_ock_rokc It's no joke. Local brewery out to shakedown your sobriety
[1:05:16] <+xeros720> yeah, there's a big weird culture around it, but it's not that big a deal

[1:05:45] <%notmicrowavesafe> @superdandy96 HUH. I've never been there. Godspeed on your room temp beer I guess.
[1:05:45] <KaironFortressKnight> Hobos in the Yakuza series is usually pretty solid folk
[1:05:46] <+skyheys> yes but no
[1:05:47] <%condemned_15> errbody NOBLE
[1:05:48] <Darren716> Yakuza hobos are heroes
[1:05:50] <%WritebroAlpha> David Cage WISHES his noble hobbos were this well-written

[1:06:02] <Komayeda> I mean, those don't come out till Yakuza LOD
[1:06:02] <+QueequegTheater> But the villains will always have tragic backstories that excuse their genocidal actions
[1:06:02] <+AbnormalVoid> hoble nomeless

[1:06:08] <$Superdandy96> @notmicrowavesafe lol, thanks.
[1:06:11] <CappuccinoGuil> Hobos in this game aren't really "noble" but more so just "regular people"
[1:06:13] <colzack_> Yakuza games are generally just good at handling homeless characters
[1:06:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> @johnnychopsocky they also have the "Velvet hammer" which is 9.5%. That one is so smooth though you can't even tell your drunk until you stand up
[1:06:20] <%p4ntless> ahh the homeless, or as the Japanese call them, street ronin
[1:06:21] <niddron> Has there ever been dirty cops in a Yakuza game?
[1:06:23] <jorniev> HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY
[1:06:25] <Komayeda> Yeah
[1:06:29] <Komayeda> You play as one in 4
[1:06:34] <@akuda_bar> @CappuccinoGuil yeah they're really big on just characterizing them and making them normal humans
[1:06:36] <+skyheys> Does V remember what Akiyama called the Champion District bars?
