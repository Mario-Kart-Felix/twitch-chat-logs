[0:01:45] <lyzejag> I got a code for the beta i'm so happy
[0:01:46] <+cubbywolf> imo it's no sekiro
[0:01:49] <+cubbywolf> looks dope
[0:01:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> The Cursed Dark Souls Mod is soo crazy impressive
[0:01:56] <+octoculi> What's funny is seeing the "Souls Like" tag on steam.
[0:02:00] <ds3namecaldara> loving big souls
[0:02:02] <%trigunstar26> Hell yeah this stream made me start a new DS1 playthrough and I finally made it through Blighttown!
[0:02:04] <%Prevot> actually, its Demons Souls 5
[0:02:06] <youngking_kush> It's Big Souls which does change things more than people think
[0:02:06] <Xaeveax> Dodging with all that dexterity
[0:02:08] <Chatterbox1991> the fact that there's actual stealth mechanics in a Souls Game is astonishing
[0:02:12] <+octoculi> Like seeing "Metroidvainia" on the new Metroid.
[0:02:13] <+Santamooo> Is this session 3 or 4?
[0:02:17] <%thesickestzak> King’s Field 11
[0:02:18] <Chatterbox1991> yes i know sekiro but still
[0:02:19] <%Juriasu> Reggie is parrying the spoilers
[0:02:21] <%nintega010> Will you try to watch Arcane
[0:02:22] <+cubbywolf> LUL I'm watching karate kid 1 on TV. well watching is a strong word for background noise
[0:02:28] <%phd_in_thuggery> Cheer500 the journey of Reggie going through these games has inspired me to finally buckle down and get my best friend to go through the MGS games since he's an FG only kind of guy. keep up the good work, love y'all
[0:02:30] <Sonny_Firestorm> woohoo, I caught the show when it's starting!
[0:02:45] <Basic_Birch_> I just got in on the Elden Ring network test and I'm so hyped
[0:02:49] <+cubbywolf> that lack of fall damage son
[0:02:49] <TenorSounds> I cant wait for when Reggie gets to Bloodborne
[0:02:52] <youngking_kush> Reggie gotta play Bloodborne first
[0:02:59] <ds3namecaldara> yes
[0:03:00] <Xaeveax> Fingers crossed for a key
[0:03:08] <JetpackMcQuack> ignorance is the best part
[0:03:08] <%Solidnick18> hello
[0:03:14] <%phd_in_thuggery> oooooh
[0:03:16] <ds3namecaldara> 15 minutes to go for NA

[0:04:43] <+warlockwithapixie> @Prevot thanks

[0:05:31] <%hiswill98> I’m still waiting on a code for the Network Test
[0:05:34] <MinersLoveGames> I unironically enjoyed my time with DS2.
[0:05:38] <leith_aziz> Hi pickyWave
[0:05:38] <%Indigo_Automaton> IT'S MASSIVE
[0:05:39] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:05:39] <vavilonica> and colorsss
[0:05:42] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie's MAP BUTTON
[0:05:47] <+cubbywolf> you get a map new ds game confirmed
[0:05:51] <%thesickestzak> But there’s a map and crafting REEEEEE /s
[0:05:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> SuckerPunchSyd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! 34 months! Good to see you both! I remember back when i was playing dark souls on the 360, I forgot to pick up the estus flask and didnt know what was wrong since i kept bashing my head on Taurus with no results. Had to reset and hoping to see more!
[0:05:56] <+cubbywolf> REEEE
[0:05:57] <haisho> it's a Here Be Dragons kind of map
[0:06:00] <+mitchpitchfork> DS2 still my favorite after all this time
[0:06:01] <@Solidus_113> and you have to find or unlock the map fragments
[0:06:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's like Shadow of the Colossus sized or bigger
[0:06:06] <%CateHecate> the sekiro map
[0:06:10] <ds3namecaldara> minutes to go code waiters
[0:06:15] <Hypnotoad0823> it's not sekiros map
[0:06:24] <@Solidus_113> BOTW waypoints
[0:06:26] <leith_aziz> @thesickestzak I dont really mind the map, but I dont tend to find crafting "fun", even if I love TW3
[0:06:32] <vavilonica> sekiro had a map???
[0:06:36] <Xaeveax> @ds3namecaldara Wait really? They are dropping today?
[0:06:38] <+cubbywolf> horse button
[0:06:41] <%trigunstar26> @woolieversus any plans to play some of the old God of War games before Ragnarok comes out? I’d love to see you check out Ghost of Sparta
[0:06:44] <%Supermonaman> Had to be here for some more dark souls with Reggie. Also the more I think about Elden ring with what little I have seen the more excited I get. It's going to be awesome! Cheer1000
[0:06:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @vavilonica just a general layout of areas but not very useful
[0:07:02] <leith_aziz> @trigunstar26 Woolie has played some GOW games, and im not sure how he feels about them
[0:07:06] <T_Sasquatch> Sekiro .... Is .... Yea
[0:07:08] <Hypnotoad0823> HORSE
[0:07:09] <%Prevot> a jump that doesn't require holding and then tapping the same button? madness!
[0:07:13] <%Solidnick18> The parry thing was alright
[0:07:21] <%Solidnick18> yeah that
[0:07:22] <MinersLoveGames> Seeing people nitpicking every little thing about Elden Ring is hilarious to me. Meanwhile, I'm just standing here like, "more soulsborne, hell yeah!"
[0:07:27] <vavilonica> Sekiro was better than DS3 dont @ me
[0:07:34] <T_Sasquatch> Forcing parrying as your main gameplay really hurt it for me and I love MGR
[0:07:34] <+Laycas49> Sekiro is a ballbuster
[0:07:36] <@Solidus_113> bad take
[0:07:40] <leith_aziz> I am curious what you find gripes about Sekiro, or just prefer Souls more.
[0:07:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Elden Ring's system seems like closer to souls but incorporating some of Sekiro's mechanics
[0:07:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:07:48] <@Solidus_113> Sekiro has good bosses and nothing else
[0:07:51] <leith_aziz> There aint always a reason soemtimes
[0:08:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THE HORSE JUMPS
[0:08:05] <JetpackMcQuack> always just off camera
[0:08:09] <leith_aziz> So Roche. Nice pickyEZ

[0:08:47] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 I dont play Souls game, but come on, that's an exaggeration. pickyAYAYA
[0:08:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> my only concern with the open world is how easy it will be to miss a super good item or an important event
[0:08:49] <JetpackMcQuack> ora ora ora ora ora ora
[0:08:50] <%guiltyboya> I didn't vibe with Sekiro, don't know why.
[0:08:50] <%sewermonk> skeleton summoning axe too
[0:08:51] <jett_eyes> wooliePOYO
[0:09:08] <+Xeogred> Big Souls. Put it into my veins
[0:09:14] <+NYCrownlessKing> codes are going out, i got no code yet Sadge
[0:09:23] <kikoeru_san> I vide hard with everything in Sekiro, the level design and enemy placement is awesome
[0:09:25] <T_Sasquatch> Sekiro showed me fromsofts biggest strengths and biggest weaknessess
[0:09:28] <leith_aziz> Im curious mostly as an outsider. I wanna see how it turns out as soemone who's never played Souls games
[0:09:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> Sekiro was almost everything I wanted build-wise, so I can't agree with the notion that it isn't as good as BB/Souls.
[0:09:29] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Inferno Plus!
[0:09:31] <%guiltyboya> Souls Of The Wild

[0:10:08] <%Irridium> Saw Sanctuary
[0:10:09] <+Xeogred> unpopular take chat, I liked Sekiro more than BB
[0:10:10] <+Jaromero435> Its WILD
[0:10:15] <leith_aziz> What?
[0:10:16] <AvroEltz> It has the fortnite default dance that build up curse when you do it
[0:10:18] <%Solidnick18> wat
[0:10:22] <T_Sasquatch> @xeogred kindly leave
[0:10:27] <TigerClaws12> squirrel ring
[0:10:29] <JetpackMcQuack> He relinked the fire
[0:10:33] <youngking_kush> @xeogred Yeah idk, I love Sekiro but BB is the best
[0:10:38] <Xaeveax> @Xeogred Unpopular but I respect it. Even though it's wrong. :)
[0:10:44] <+Xeogred> BB was too easy after some Souls games. lol, least Sekiro was challenging and different
[0:10:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @woolieversus he also tweaked DS to perfection
[0:11:00] <Xaeveax> Sekiro was the hardest I would say
[0:11:01] <+silentsipher> so excited to see more of this play through. the last one was really fun to watch
[0:11:08] <@Solidus_113> 16 guns, 1 hidden in each map
[0:11:08] <+Xeogred> but hey they're all 10's to me
[0:11:11] <T_Sasquatch> My game now TriHard
[0:11:19] <Xaeveax> Yeah they are all super good
[0:11:19] <jett_eyes> Every souls game is easy if you go in with prior experience
[0:11:21] <darkkittycatlovery> This sounds like the guy who made the worlds longest warthog in halo lol
[0:11:21] <leith_aziz> Can people calm down on which game they prefer? I can see some people prefer one thing over another. It aint that hard to grasp.
[0:11:21] <velgaduere> Dark Halos
[0:11:22] <yomamma133713> Senior was pretty easy, it was just different
[0:11:23] <+Bitscreed> Halo: Lordran Evolved
[0:11:28] <miltoned91> have you seen the ak 47 dark souls run?
[0:11:28] <yomamma133713> Sekiro*
[0:11:31] <jett_eyes> easier*
[0:11:36] <leith_aziz> Every Souls game has it's quirks and strengths
[0:11:36] <JetpackMcQuack> people playing an imposter mode
[0:11:39] <oda_flobunaga> The lack of Build Variety kills Sekiro for me
[0:11:39] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> I was playing this weekend for the heck of it

[0:15:01] <%Prevot> I only invest in SifCoin
[0:15:07] <leith_aziz> @KeiganOfAstora They want people to talk to when they feel down. I do the same when I cope with feeling alone in being a Guilty Gear lorehead enjoyer
[0:15:10] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[0:15:12] <%KellBeII> <3

[0:15:38] <CatRidder> reggicoin
[0:15:41] <JetpackMcQuack> you'll laugh your ass off in three-six months
[0:15:43] <BeatUzumaki> Lmaooooo nah you can’t forget it
[0:15:46] <%Solidnick18> he is just still getting into it.
[0:15:47] <%scrumbotime> The darksign is when you open a crypto wallet
[0:15:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NFT: Not Fucking Trustworthy
[0:15:49] <+deadredeyez> @beatuzumaki same
[0:15:51] <MrMatternot> No explanation needed until ChaosWitch
[0:15:52] <glass_marcus> That was one of the best podcast in a minute

[0:16:07] <+HollowMan190> NEVER
[0:16:12] <+JerPostsCringe> @WoolieVersus Hey Reggie. Comment on the Habs this season?
[0:16:13] <+HollowMan190> NO
[0:16:15] <%Prevot> friendly Patches is offering you some valuable NFTs, what do you say?
[0:16:18] <miucsa51> Kappa
[0:16:18] <%KellBeII> the HD collection is backwards compat on the xbone
[0:16:22] <%jinking79> right Konami LUL
[0:16:23] <leith_aziz> Ah MGS. My second Gear game where I'm a lorehead
[0:16:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Let metal gear FREE
[0:16:27] <%KellBeII> MGS4 is lost forever however
[0:16:28] <%Juriasu> there are so many game series that are almost impossible to fully experience because they are stuck on legacy hardware
[0:16:29] <@Menitta> Alright stream let's go
[0:16:34] <oda_flobunaga> MGS 1 and 2 are on GOG
[0:16:39] <%X2Eliah> You know if you had an NFT proving that you own an older game, you wouldn't need the disc.
[0:16:41] <%livlinn> 20 said pretentiously
[0:16:42] <BeatUzumaki> @woolieversus It’s not the ONLY way to experience them Kappa
[0:16:53] <%Irridium> pretty funny how MGS2 a game about preserving things from internet bullshit is pulled of online stores
[0:16:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:16:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OH NOO
[0:16:54] <%Juriasu> @X2Eliah DansGame
[0:16:57] <@Menitta> was literally just listening to WWFIO during data entry
[0:16:58] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah MGS4 is still on PS3 only, a decade later
[0:17:03] <drunken_lemur> How
[0:17:05] <%CodenameChaz> @X2Eliah Except NFTs don't provide proof of ownership...
[0:17:07] <%scrumbotime> Just Don't Get Hit
[0:17:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I DONT KNOW
[0:17:11] <+SilverDevilfish> I totally didn't see another streamer do that yesterday Kappa
[0:17:13] <%X2Eliah> @CodenameChaz sssshhhhh
[0:17:17] <glass_marcus> doesn't it come with the key?
[0:17:17] <xjn_> I didnt even know you could skip the flask, haha
[0:17:20] <+RyTYoung> That's how it's gonna be Kappa
[0:17:20] <%Lion_kun> How can you progress without talking to Oscar?

[0:17:35] <%Lion_kun> He gives you the key past the locked door.
[0:17:37] <%X2Eliah> People are fine
[0:17:38] <MrMatternot> @lion_kun you kill him
[0:17:40] <%X2Eliah> But crowds, no
[0:17:41] <oda_flobunaga> Should Woolie branch out into selling N Fts?
[0:17:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reggie's a Wild Card
[0:17:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I just ran past the rock falling  i have no clue how i missed the estus
[0:18:04] <%JerPostsCringe> JerPostsCringe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Reggie just spam them fire bombs brother , don't worry about it. All play styles are valid
[0:18:13] <arronash91> MSG 2 and 3 are not available due to historical licensing. Konami is working on re licensing
[0:18:21] <vavilonica> this is what we call Brave game design
[0:18:21] <%Lion_kun> You still get the estus if you kill Oscar.
[0:18:24] <%X2Eliah> nice
[0:18:28] <phd_in_thuggery> yoooooo
[0:18:29] <leith_aziz> @arronash91 Historical licensing? What's that?

[0:18:54] <@Menitta> fried rice is alright
[0:18:58] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Isn't rice good for you tho?
[0:18:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> rice is life
[0:19:04] <%phd_in_thuggery> sushi rice tho
[0:19:05] <%X2Eliah> @Chester_goes_Berserk Not really
[0:19:06] <darkkittycatlovery> Jasmine rice is where it’s at.
[0:19:10] <leith_aziz> @Chester_goes_Berserk Yes. Too much rice though is bad
[0:19:11] <%Solidnick18> I don't remember the last time i had rice.
[0:19:13] <@Menitta> I make a mean Gyuudon with rice
[0:19:16] <%X2Eliah> @Chester_goes_Berserk I mean its calories, but otherwise, its not great
[0:19:19] <CatRidder> rice is great
[0:19:19] <Visorak6> Rice is bad if had all the time
[0:19:22] <Afrosamasenpai> RICE BOIS
[0:19:24] <youngking_kush> Too much anything is bad
[0:19:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> I like wild rice
[0:19:27] <+ThePich> pasta tho
[0:19:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> steamed, fried, mexican, lime, so good
[0:19:31] <KeiganOfAstora> Jasmine rice is the best
[0:19:35] <KeiganOfAstora> Uncle Bens rice sucks
[0:19:37] <%shakespearo> Carbs are fine, just don't eat too much
[0:19:44] <+LazyAss24Seven> No rice. No life.
[0:19:45] <%livlinn> Rise nation PrideRise woolieGASM
[0:19:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HELL YEA RICE AND BEANS
[0:19:49] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:19:49] <Treasure_Vault> Horchata?
[0:19:51] <kikoeru_san> Risotto is the best shit tho
[0:19:52] <%X2Eliah> Rice is literally filler, yes
[0:19:52] <%DkLordG> rice and beans woolieGASM
[0:19:53] <+robertoszek> I love rice
[0:19:53] <royb2> Rice is def filler
[0:19:55] <Xaeveax> Rice for days.
[0:19:56] <leith_aziz> If you live in the middle east, you get used to rice mixed with different ingridients. That's because rice is easy to get
[0:19:57] <Klefth> Rice is the shit though
[0:19:57] <%phd_in_thuggery> Mexican Rice and Beans SLAPS
[0:19:58] <+RyTYoung> Same
[0:19:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Treasure_Vault das the good shit
[0:20:00] <mikesapartment> rice is the french fries of other food
[0:20:00] <youngking_kush> No chicken & rice???
[0:20:04] <royb2> Rice and ptoatoes is a thing in south america
[0:20:04] <%Solidnick18> bread Kreygasm
[0:20:06] <Afrosamasenpai> both tho
[0:20:08] <@Menitta> So white rice is not good for you. it's mostly simple carbs, not unlike sugars. Fried/brown Rice is more complex carbs and that's better for you
[0:20:08] <leith_aziz> Its either rice, eggs or bread
[0:20:11] <+RyTYoung> Except I only used to eat rice from the Chinese Lul
[0:20:13] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[0:20:14] <+ThePich> LET'S GET THAT BREAD
[0:20:14] <%phd_in_thuggery> Those shrimp bastards are gonna pay......
[0:20:16] <+twohitgood> i love rice and gotta have my rice and beans.
[0:20:17] <+RemedyofRevenge> chili time
[0:20:19] <leith_aziz> Not trying to make us sound too poor
[0:20:20] <drunken_lemur> The Rice War starts NOW!
[0:20:20] <glass_marcus> This is consistent with Woolie's soup preferences
[0:20:21] <%livlinn> GOHAN 🍚
[0:20:22] <MrMatternot> Rice and peas, the peas are really beans.
[0:20:28] <%trigunstar26> I enjoy white rice and fried rice but mom makes the same damn wild rice all the time. Like it’s good but I’d like something different every once in a while
[0:20:29] <slix3431> Rice vs bread
[0:20:29] <Afrosamasenpai> Goopy rice
[0:20:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok that's fair
[0:20:31] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus what is your opinion on Chili?
[0:20:32] <+aishman> Funny enough I don't miss bread but sometimes I just want pulled chicken on top of rice and corn @woolieversus
[0:20:39] <+Bitscreed> I love a good pilau rice.
[0:20:42] <%X2Eliah> Ok ok ok ok so hear me out. Rice-less Sushi?
[0:20:42] <hermyish> black beans and rice tho
[0:20:43] <KeiganOfAstora> @WoliThoughts on "Bell Peppers & Beef"? ;)
[0:20:45] <kikoeru_san> @leith_aziz eggs are protein, like that is NOT filler
[0:20:46] <youngking_kush> Bread > Rice
[0:20:46] <%Fefe41> Screw rice. TEAM NOODLES
[0:20:49] <Treasure_Vault> Mango sticky rice is the bomb
[0:20:51] <MrMatternot> Sashimi forever
[0:20:51] <DracaenaLeaf> sticky rice is the best rice
[0:20:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @X2Eliah yes i like fish
[0:20:53] <@Menitta> it brings out the flavor more
[0:20:53] <+askalta> meat plus rice tastes better than meat alone imo
[0:20:53] <%shakespearo> so is bread and pasta and  potatoes though
[0:20:56] <leith_aziz> @trigunstar26 That sounds like me and my family
[0:20:59] <%scrumbotime> I like when a meal has rice when it's also Sauce Covered then you mix the sauce into the rice
[0:21:00] <%shakespearo> that's just what carbs are in food
[0:21:03] <+LazyAss24Seven> KBBQ, ya ain’t there for the rice!
[0:21:23] <youngking_kush> Rice is like an edible plate
[0:21:25] <@Menitta> but yes white rice is no bueno. Fried is better for you overall, nutritionally
[0:21:27] <%emperordread> Bread is shit tier food, easy to discard
[0:21:28] <+RemedyofRevenge> potatoes for life
[0:21:28] <%phd_in_thuggery> some are so worth it
[0:21:35] <%phd_in_thuggery> potatoes are god tier
[0:21:40] <%glaciomaniak> pasta
[0:21:44] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : Some people are just used to eating mostly eating some type of rice or bread. Welcome to us in the middle east
[0:21:46] <+aishman> @woolieversus Funny enough when I was diagnosed my doc said my body was a disaster. Same Doc called me to congratulate me.
[0:21:47] <%shakespearo> I would sooner forgoe meat that bread
[0:21:50] <%shakespearo> bread is the king of food
[0:21:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:21:57] <MrMatternot> Sweet potato > russet potato
[0:22:00] <mikesapartment> LUL
[0:22:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:22:08] <%noelsbedroom> LMAO
[0:22:09] <+ThePich> let the former diabetic enjoy his rice man
[0:22:09] <@Menitta> You gotta know what's simple and what's complex. theres a lot of conflicting nutritional info out there and its infuriating
[0:22:11] <%thesickestzak> woolieGASM
[0:22:12] <%phd_in_thuggery> woolieF woolieU
[0:22:13] <%trigunstar26> I like potatoes but not mashed cuz it’s easy to take too much, not big on yams/sweet potatoes but blue sweet potatoes are great!
[0:22:13] <karawra> LUL
[0:22:14] <+patriotrenegade> Scrimbo's Headband...
[0:22:20] <%Solidnick18> The classics
[0:22:22] <Visorak6> The sekiro secret ending is bullshit
[0:22:23] <vavilonica> Miyazaki Unchained
[0:22:26] <leith_aziz> @Menitta Shit, I think our family eats white bread most of the time
[0:22:31] <+mechslayer71> don't walk past the brunglo gate or Torko 5he forsaken will die in the latrine!
[0:22:31] <%thesickestzak> I love it so much lol
[0:22:36] <%xjn_> all endings are true endings
[0:22:43] <anachronologist> looking forward to more Dark Souls action. When is Reggington going live?
[0:22:47] <leith_aziz> The Majima building strategy
[0:22:48] <%phd_in_thuggery> CRUNGUS MCBUNGUS TELLS YOU HOW TO BIPPITY BOP THE FUCKING SCHWARBAGE
[0:22:50] <oda_flobunaga> Well, its just oldschool game design
[0:22:52] <RushUnplugged> touch the scrunco before Benny the Unbimbled reaches the Fracovian Peaks
[0:22:53] <youngking_kush> I mean you can literally leave messages for people
[0:22:55] <CatRidder> to get the best ending you need to read book 7 of song of ice and fire
[0:22:57] <%Prevot> make sure to never fight the boss that's wandering the overworld at all times, otherwise Scrimblo of Astora will go hollow
[0:23:01] <karawra> the sekiro secret ending was next level
[0:23:08] <@Menitta> it kinda sucks
[0:23:09] <%livlinn> woolieOMG
[0:23:10] <vavilonica> it's because they are Brave game for Brave gamers
[0:23:16] <%phd_in_thuggery> A little Bungus
[0:23:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> talk to bungli wungli EXACTLY 4 times, or else they turn against you in the final fight!
[0:23:25] <mikesapartment> we'll get there
[0:23:29] <Darren716> It really isn't that complex
[0:23:30] <leith_aziz> That sounds kinda sus. At least give me hints in the game. They can be as vague as possible, but have them in the game
[0:23:32] <+patriotrenegade> Oh youll see
[0:23:32] <Drusain> Don't forget the original DeS has no messages anymore
[0:23:33] <theamazingaesoup> They have changed that in later games
[0:23:33] <KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:23:34] <%Javaa01> Because fuck you, that's why
[0:23:35] <%phd_in_thuggery> Gungan
[0:23:35] <JetpackMcQuack> You can take a stab at it
[0:23:36] <Darren716> you just kill two golems
[0:23:37] <KeiganOfAstora> That's in 2 months
[0:23:38] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:23:38] <%thesickestzak> Simply trade the small red mushroom with Crunglily of Ice before fighting Jeff of the Bridge or you’ll miss out on the secret boss
[0:23:39] <%Bread_Assassin> There’s a day/night cycle and I know there’s gonna be like one thing that’s missilery by like Day 5.
[0:23:41] <%scrumbotime> Because Fuck You
[0:23:42] <JetpackMcQuack> try to find it
[0:23:42] <MrPedrovsky> Missed last stream. Is Blighttown start today???
[0:23:46] <%X2Eliah> You pay for the experience of searching for it
[0:23:46] <haisho> When you reach it you'll know.
[0:23:47] <vavilonica> I love it
[0:23:48] <+eanscrale> I wouldn't have it any other way
[0:23:48] <leith_aziz> Wait, you dont even know how to access teh DLC? That sounds awfull
[0:23:49] <KeiganOfAstora> The game literally tells you nothing
[0:23:49] <+blastyoboots> Reggie, it took the WHOLE COMMUNITY DAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO THE DLC AFTER IT CAME OUT
[0:23:53] <Xaeveax> The Dark Souls 1 DLC is stupid to get to. They figured it out better in the future games.
[0:23:53] <+Rasheedt> @mrpedrovsky yeah
[0:23:54] <Teradyne87> Like finding the end of P.T.
[0:23:57] <oda_flobunaga> PS:T has some STUFF most people never find
[0:23:59] <agustorm123> Make him find it by his own
[0:24:01] <RushUnplugged> it's that old-school idea that you're supposed to ask your friend at school how to do it
[0:24:01] <Darren716> Yup, last time ended with Reg killing gaping
[0:24:03] <@Solidus_113> Dark 2 did it well
[0:24:08] <+askalta> at least they don't expect you to buy a guide woolie
[0:24:10] <olaksi> you can stumble easily on the amulet, but finding the exact random spot to walk into afterwards...
[0:24:12] <DrkJP520> The dlc is in a corner somewhere you'd never think to go back to
[0:24:17] <%shakespearo> I like the obtuse stuff. So many games are obsessed with showing you everything
[0:24:17] <Johannen> I found Sekiro to be perfectly fine without online
[0:24:19] <KeiganOfAstora> It's not a lie, holy shit. It's just a better C
[0:24:24] <+maximumcrit> Wouldn’t be as bad if the lore hints were a bit better in game
[0:24:27] <+Orbital_Zero> @trigunstar26 Sweet Potatoes are my favorite! In Mexico we call them "Camote" and my mom's family makes a bunch of different stuff with them lol
[0:24:27] <%phd_in_thuggery> @woolieversus Okay but how sick was it to find Hypogean Gaol?
[0:24:30] <+swesterly> It is meant to incentivize exploration, most overly obtuse bits are only reviled because gamers demand instant gratification
[0:24:30] <KeiganOfAstora> You dealt with this in your own LP and didn't get this salty about it then
[0:24:31] <sendart> the game never tells you Dex helps cast speed
[0:24:35] <leith_aziz> @shakespearo That's fine, but not for FINDING THE DLC YOU PAYED FOR
[0:24:35] <Darren716> Why does Woolie not understand scaling so much?
[0:24:41] <+ArtemisCroc> woolie, the letters denote general percentages of scaling, they're not lies lol
[0:24:42] <glass_marcus> I put like 6 levels into res in my first playthrough
[0:24:43] <youngking_kush> I feel like it only matter when there's an actual letter difference
[0:24:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> Resistance best build
[0:24:47] <Darren716> Like it's just different tiers of letters
[0:24:50] <%Javaa01> And it's not the obvious joke stat, cause that stat is busted good in NG+
[0:24:55] <T_Sasquatch> @shakespearo there's obtuse and there's bullshit
[0:24:56] <@Menitta> isnt there a ring or something that says itll regen health but it just...doesnt?
[0:25:01] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus on one hand I can agree that it can be frustrating but I also love starting up new playthroughs and discovering things I never noticed before
[0:25:08] <Xaeveax> Dude, finish Bloodborne. 10/10
[0:25:09] <MrMatternot> C-, C, and C+ all display as C
[0:25:11] <%shakespearo> @shakespearo I love that bit though. It's total bullshit, but I love it
[0:25:15] <+askalta> infusions change scaling and the letters can be misleading with elemental infusion
[0:25:19] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus BTW Plague was dunking on Reggarth's piggy hat
[0:25:22] <MinersLoveGames> A couple of levels into resistance early on can help with managing against early bleed and poison enemies, but that's about it.
[0:25:25] <@Menitta> YEAH BCV

[0:46:15] <benupde287> 1 large shard, Reggie has 3
[0:46:22] <youngking_kush> Then again at +10
[0:46:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> chaos zwei lessgooo pog
[0:46:24] <Johannen> Raw is never good
[0:46:26] <brunoberserk> it is just 1 large titanite shard to ascend to +6
[0:46:29] <+ThePich> lolno
[0:46:30] <mikesapartment> scaling gone
[0:46:32] <sendart> does he have any green shards? magic claymore is alright
[0:46:36] <+patriotrenegade> raw is almost never better
[0:46:41] <Darren716> You can always revert back
[0:46:43] <+Shishi1205> raw for sl1?
[0:46:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's a bit spoilery for reggie maybe, but i find a flowchart helps visualize upgrade paths
[0:46:58] <Equirah> raw is for low sl or for int7faith builds
[0:46:59] <QueequegTheater> @Shishi1205 Only when you don't have fire/lightning
[0:47:00] <Darren716> No green yet, blight town is the earliest you can get them I believe
[0:47:00] <%Orbital_Zero> I really like Min/Max ing lol
[0:47:02] <brunoberserk> raw is for SL1 crazy people
[0:47:06] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:47:06] <+ArtemisCroc> raw is okay if you have bare minimum stats, until you get lightn ing anyway
[0:47:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> is raw good for bad scaling weapons or magic builds?
[0:47:08] <+Shishi1205> Yeah I guess
[0:47:24] <fantom_flasch> @dreadedcthulhu raw is good for scaling with strength or dex
[0:47:25] <benupde287> Raw is bad if you have stats
[0:47:31] <fantom_flasch> Oh wait
[0:47:34] <youngking_kush> A raw dagger is good on mage if you can parry
[0:47:36] <KeiganOfAstora> Raw is only good until your stats get to 25
[0:47:37] <fantom_flasch> I forgot what raw is
[0:47:38] <slix3431> Based weapon
[0:47:40] <linSP> Raw is good if you’re weak
[0:47:44] <Darren716> Legit are there any good boss weapons in DS1?
[0:47:57] <+Shishi1205> @Darren716 abyssal?

[0:48:02] <Equirah> @fantom_flasch my dude LUL
[0:48:02] <+Soaring_Orca31> raw is good IF YOU'RE MARRIED

[0:48:07] <sirrice77> @Darren716 I don't think so
[0:48:07] <+ArtemisCroc> @Darren716 Furysword
[0:48:10] <KeiganOfAstora> Go to +6
[0:48:21] <QueequegTheater> @Darren716 Quelaag and Priscilla
[0:48:21] <youngking_kush> It happens again at +10
[0:48:21] <zedwhyva> nice chest ahead
[0:48:25] <Shwepie> @dreadedcthulhu For already bad scaling weapons, yeah Raw can be good. For magic builds a Magic or Enchanted weapon is better.
[0:48:29] <%CateHecate> @Darren716 Dragon Bone Fist has A-tier strength scaling and is probably one of the only fast STR weapons in the game
[0:48:34] <andre11dr> Shit why no notification Twitch NotLikeThis

[0:52:55] <NaberiustheNefarious> wait until he learns they're all different
[0:53:03] <+eanscrale> The stability of tat shield is doing a lot for this figt
[0:53:09] <+Jiggisnipe> awww
[0:53:11] <+RyTYoung> Get in the stink zone Kappa
[0:53:11] <%dreadedcthulhu> pain
[0:53:11] <+Shishi1205> bro the one near the secret passage is super tough
[0:53:12] <+TheFrancix> fuck
[0:53:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not bad for a first try
[0:53:15] <andre11dr> If he did have both legs he would be tall as fuck
[0:53:16] <%dreadedcthulhu> almost had him tho
[0:53:18] <scarman125> chocked
[0:53:23] <+kewlmyc> also optional, I think
[0:53:25] <oddbunker> at least this demon is next door
[0:53:25] <scarman125> choked even
[0:53:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NaberiustheNefarious wdym?
[0:53:32] <+patriotrenegade> Cinders mod has a Titanite demon with FOUR legs
[0:53:32] <AvroEltz> can reggie figure out the secret joestar technique?
[0:53:33] <youngking_kush> I've never beaten the Titanite Demon in Anor Londor lol
[0:53:36] <MrMatternot> There is a room with 4 of them
[0:53:37] <%scrumbotime> He's an example of damage resistances, wayyyy weaker to blunt weapons than cutting since he's a rock
[0:53:40] <NaberiustheNefarious> each titantite demon has different hitbox properties
[0:53:48] <+Shishi1205> @MrMatternot a Floor more like
[0:53:50] <NaberiustheNefarious> the later ones have way more range
[0:54:17] <+patriotrenegade> Honestly the two togetehr at the bottom of Sens Fortress can go to hell
[0:54:21] <%Josef_Stryker> I always dreaded fighting these guys
[0:54:26] <%Josef_Stryker> These guys are the worst
[0:54:26] <+Shishi1205> the one you fight inside a room has some bs camera jank
[0:54:40] <sirrice77> Don't these drop their weapon rarely?
[0:54:40] <JetpackMcQuack> pretty good bouncer
[0:54:41] <scarman125> I can't even remember how to get to the bottom of sens fortress without falling
[0:54:42] <youngking_kush> @shishi1205 That's the one
[0:54:44] <T_Sasquatch> It's weird how slow dark souls 1 looks compared to its sequels
[0:54:44] <+patriotrenegade> 180 in the air
[0:54:47] <%X2Eliah> Cant wait until Reggie switches to a full caster build
[0:54:51] <MrMatternot> The Anor Londo one is the Capra Demon of Titanite
[0:54:57] <QueequegTheater> thank you reggie
[0:54:57] <AvroEltz> oh yeah, the one in izalith bridge is so strong, its fucking bullshit
[0:55:09] <+Shishi1205> Bro DS2 is also pretty slow compared to bb and ds3
[0:55:31] <+Shishi1205> Is the one after the sun bugs the toughest one? It feels like it
[0:55:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> countdown to grab?
[0:55:42] <jumpyhugs> @AvroEltz but it respawns though.  Not like they can just hand out titanite for free
[0:55:42] <AvroEltz> Am i crazy or is reggie no using the sprint attacks for bigger enemies?
[0:55:44] <youngking_kush> I think he's the strongest yeah
[0:55:47] <scarman125> speaking of bullshit and BB Winter Lanterns can fucking burn in hell
[0:55:54] <youngking_kush> But you can actually fight him tho
[0:56:02] <AbnormalVoid> doesn't Reggie have Magic Weapon?
[0:56:04] <sendart> those jumps are gonna get him killed lol
[0:56:07] <LunarRemix> You cannot roll out of a spring
[0:56:11] <+ArtemisCroc> if this is remastered you can rebind jump
[0:56:12] <LunarRemix> Sprint*
[0:56:15] <%haitakaa> can you cut his tail?
[0:56:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie doin it tho
[0:56:17] <%haitakaa> I forget
[0:56:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @haitakaa no
[0:56:27] <Johannen> Is switching to L3 for jump an option?
[0:56:28] <drunken_lemur> C'mon Reggie, it doesn't even have a head!
[0:56:28] <%A_German_spy> @haitakaa Not these things, no
[0:56:30] <%CateHecate> the titanite demon is going to give reggarth the people's elbow
[0:56:31] <HAttilaTheFun> Now this is podracing!
[0:56:31] <QueequegTheater> monkaS
[0:56:33] <+Shishi1205> the one on the bridge is a tad bit lighter like more silver coloreed
[0:56:33] <+patriotrenegade> big sips for big bois
[0:56:34] <Spearweaver> gotta block if you wanna roll during a sprint
[0:56:37] <Ultimatefool> Souls Jank LUL
[0:56:43] <JetpackMcQuack> HahaSweat
[0:56:44] <brunoberserk> dont forget thtat you can change the jump button

[0:57:49] <bearwagon> luck is a skill
[0:57:50] <andre11dr> It's a genuinely good halberd type weapon too
[0:57:53] <brunoberserk> lucky and plucky
[0:57:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @thefrancix I WILL SHIT
[0:57:55] <subjectg> titanite catch pole is guaranteed on the last one @shishi1205
[0:58:00] <glass_marcus> Reggie Will get a slab drop, I'm calling it
[0:58:05] <+Shishi1205> @subjectg got it just b4 the last one
[0:58:15] <+kewlmyc> Only rare drop he hasn't gotten yet is Baller Swag Sword, though it's only a matter of time.
[0:58:15] <$hattrick61> remember how mad pat gotat how many BK weapons woole got
[0:58:15] <subjectg> @shishi1205 close enuff
[0:58:20] <miucsa51> Natural  20
[0:58:24] <+Shishi1205> Bro reggie getting a slab from the darkwraiths
[0:58:38] <warpiscute> 2h all the time is the best strat
[0:58:42] <subjectg> watch him get those ghost daggers from new londo
[0:58:43] <QueequegTheater> Reggie's gonna get the Dark Hand from a drop
[0:58:47] <subjectg> both of them
[0:58:52] <youngking_kush> @shishi1205 No foreal LUL LUL
[0:58:52] <andre11dr> Luckily he's already past the point where he would get the bladder swole sword
[0:58:52] <primaryfire> following the swing creates a larger intersection between his active frames and your iframes
[0:58:59] <scarman125> roll under the attack not run. you're gonna get Reggie's head cut off
[0:59:02] <MrMatternot> You gonna tell Reggie that there are more of them?
[0:59:03] <+Shishi1205> @QueequegTheater I actually got it quite early last playtrough
[0:59:05] <%Dcapit8ed> @Shishi1205 100% gonna happen lol
[0:59:08] <%emMmDeeKay> Woolie Reggie spends his WHOLE luck today and don't let Reggie use his half-Halfling luck by denying him a Long Rest for Dokapon
[0:59:08] <youngking_kush> That's crazy
[0:59:18] <AvroEltz> Dark hand is fine, but if he gets the slab i swear to god
[0:59:24] <%emMmDeeKay> woolie makes reggie*
[0:59:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @emMmDeeKay bold of you to assume his luck runs out
[0:59:43] <+RyTYoung> He wouldn't even know what he had yet if he got the slab drop NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:59:51] <andre11dr> Reggie might see a vagrant at this point
[0:59:51] <+Shishi1205> bro the moment hegoes for the halber BK he gets it
[0:59:59] <subjectg> i found it far easier to roll into his empty hand during the short swing honestly
[1:00:06] <yomamma133713> It's not always the side they swing from
[1:00:10] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr I've seen one once
[1:00:11] <T_Sasquatch> I just roll back or through 😂 , works somehow
[1:00:12] <youngking_kush> Move AGAINST the Hitbox
[1:00:14] <+RyTYoung> @subjectg I do that too
[1:00:16] <%X2Eliah> If the sword is coming from 8 o'clock to starboard, you want to roll left-North-left
[1:00:32] <warpiscute> once you learn to roll through attacks the game gets much more manageable
[1:00:35] <+Shishi1205> yeah roll against not with it
[1:00:43] <benupde287> I’ve played this game more times than I can count, and I’ve only ever seen 1 vagrant
[1:00:44] <+Shishi1205> MH basics
[1:00:45] <subjectg> There’s often no one-size-fits-all solution for all enemies
[1:00:56] <JetpackMcQuack> poor guy got mugged
[1:00:57] <%Solidnick18> and it hops at you
[1:01:00] <MrMatternot> Blacksmith diety Is Vamoose
[1:01:01] <subjectg> since they can track wherever and whenever they want
[1:01:04] <+eanscrale> It's enough
[1:01:06] <andre11dr> I wonder if Woolie ever knows about vagrants, Spy probably eventually told him
[1:01:09] <oddbunker> so people have been mining titanite demons for their prescious ore
[1:01:20] <AvroEltz> And its made of rocks, and they can shoot lightning, because fuck it
[1:01:25] <+Shishi1205> there are 2 types of vagrants right?
[1:01:28] <youngking_kush> UBER RARE
[1:01:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LOW
[1:01:32] <QueequegTheater> IT'S LOW
[1:01:35] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Quite_Dapper
[1:01:36] <+pectusumbra> yo! That also scales int!
[1:01:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> and it's a demon using faith
[1:01:39] <subjectg> White vagrants and red vagrants ye @shishi1205
[1:01:49] <LunarRemix> This weapon's perfect for Reggie huh
[1:01:49] <+Shishi1205> first try catch pole is wild
[1:01:51] <%Solidnick18> it's cool
[1:01:54] <Quite_Dapper> That's a sick pull
[1:01:54] <%Orbital_Zero> I think I've only got it once out of my 10 playthroughs!
[1:01:55] <DapperCadavr> One of the best magic weapons
[1:02:03] <youngking_kush> It scales INT
[1:02:04] <+eanscrale> I really wish this weapon was better for how hard it is to get
[1:02:05] <AbnormalVoid> have him try them out
[1:02:07] <SheefEatsBeef> he can use it oh shi
[1:02:07] <subjectg> It’s ok, its moveset could be better
[1:02:08] <youngking_kush> Perfect
[1:02:10] <%Solidnick18> alright
[1:02:10] <+pectusumbra> and it looks like it does magic damage
[1:02:11] <Equirah> it's really good for him
[1:02:12] <user_naim> Oh for crying out loud he got that too?
[1:02:15] <+patriotrenegade> Its a halberd
[1:02:23] <Quite_Dapper> Halberd moveset
[1:02:23] <%Solidnick18> 2 hand
[1:02:23] <andre11dr> Scales INT ,that could really work for him
[1:02:28] <Jaysky> No weapon requires intelligence. All are unga.
[1:02:29] <%Bread_Assassin> Reggie’s been getting real lucky with drops.
[1:02:32] <%Solidnick18> yep
[1:02:36] <AbnormalVoid> yeyeyeye
[1:02:38] <+RyTYoung> ye
[1:02:39] <youngking_kush> I THINK THATS THE ONE REGGIE
[1:02:39] <+pectusumbra> man if that's not a sign I don't know what is
[1:02:46] <QueequegTheater> @Jaysky Artorias sword
[1:02:47] <+TheFrancix> STAMINA
[1:02:50] <Jontman42> takes some huge stamina
[1:02:51] <+Shishi1205> yeah thats a halberd
[1:02:55] <DapperCadavr> yayayya
[1:02:57] <%Solidnick18> big one
[1:02:59] <yomamma133713> That weapons looking nice
[1:03:00] <oddbunker> just remember to land hits and then the halberd is forever s tier
[1:03:00] <andre11dr> I think it can be buffed too
[1:03:01] <Quite_Dapper> if you get higher strength you'll sway around less
[1:03:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I always loved this weapon
[1:03:04] <Quite_Dapper> right?
[1:03:07] <AbnormalVoid> does it pancake?
[1:03:10] <Treasure_Vault> It's actually pretty good for early game?
[1:03:10] <QueequegTheater> It's not but it's hype
[1:03:15] <+pectusumbra> That will work for a while and eventually MGS
[1:03:15] <subjectg> i prefer the stabs of the regular halberd
[1:03:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The jump totally pancakes
[1:03:23] <QueequegTheater> This might be his best weapon right now
[1:03:24] <+blastyoboots> @WoolieVersus In Dark Souls, halberds always stagger you if you WHIFF, but they don't if you hit or are blocked.  Note that is why it's doing that in the animations even though you have the stats for it
[1:03:25] <AbnormalVoid> sick
[1:03:26] <Jaysky> @queequegtheater I hold weapon and swing do good number do trick no no intelligence need int bad
[1:03:28] <scarman125> the Abyss Sword R2's are amazing
[1:03:28] <benupde287> It is a VERY rare drop
[1:03:33] <DedlokPM> Lucky Reg
[1:03:35] <Jontman42> I've never gotten it lol
[1:03:39] <+RyTYoung> doodYelp
[1:03:40] <andre11dr> It's not sadly
[1:03:41] <+Shishi1205> 2%?
[1:03:43] <LunarRemix> That's a really good weapon you should consider it as a weapon
[1:03:43] <AbnormalVoid> Try out Zwei now that you have the stats
[1:03:44] <youngking_kush> Lucky Reg
[1:03:47] <+patel347> its probably guranteed on the last one
[1:03:47] <Quite_Dapper> In multiple playthoughs I've never seen it drop
[1:03:48] <%Solidnick18> always lucky
[1:03:48] <warpiscute> did ds3 remove the whiff animation from halberds?
[1:03:50] <QueequegTheater> USE IT
[1:03:52] <+pectusumbra> I do hope he tries it out
[1:03:53] <+eanscrale> It's was always a little disappointing in Dark Souls 1 how many unique weapons weren't all that great in paractics
[1:03:53] <+NahmenJayden> Luck is a skill
[1:03:57] <andre11dr> I think it's like 5%
[1:03:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:04:01] <Equirah> Reggie should at least try it on some enemies
[1:04:02] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus It seems like its 2%
[1:04:03] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus for context, I have played this game for some 800+ hours, and I think I've gotten the pole drop ONCE.
[1:04:04] <+swesterly> That scaling is in line with his build
[1:04:09] <+askalta> upgrades with twinkling I think
[1:04:10] <Darren716> +6
[1:04:20] <scarman125> upgrade the claymore
[1:04:21] <Treasure_Vault> Surprised Reggie didn't get the Balder Sword from the first knight
[1:04:21] <+blastyoboots> @WoolieVersus You might want to have him try the catchpole on enemies-- In Dark Souls, halberds always stagger you if you WHIFF, but they don't if you hit or are blocked.  Note that is why it's doing that in the animations even though you have the stats for it
[1:04:27] <subjectg> @eanscrale a lot of them have odd scalings and are a pain to upgrade, which really sucks
[1:04:29] <scarman125> +6
[1:04:30] <youngking_kush> @eanscrale I feel like that's a big thing they wanted to address with Elden Ring
[1:04:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @blastyoboots he knows
[1:04:38] <+blastyoboots> ah okay sorry :x
[1:04:40] <QueequegTheater> 6600
[1:04:48] <%Solidnick18> or save it
[1:04:49] <oda_flobunaga> The Catch Pole also does magic damage so its total damage is fracking massive right now
[1:04:49] <+blastyoboots> been phasing in and out of viewing so couldn't tell
[1:04:55] <Johannen> +6 claymore will allow you to upgrade it yourself if you want in the future without Andre

[1:05:12] <Equirah> you guys know the more you push wollie to have reggie try something the less it's likely to happen right?
[1:05:16] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus The wiki says its 2% ignoring the guaranteed drop in someone of them
[1:05:27] <+patel347> you can always go for magic or enchanted weapons

[1:05:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I feel like the catchpole might actually outdamage his main weapon at this point
[1:05:34] <andre11dr> So did he settle down on Dex or Str ?
[1:05:37] <Forgottenblade_> forgot15YUS forgot15YUS forgot15YUS forgot15YUS
[1:05:41] <+Shishi1205> @fruit_pie_the_magician yeah by far
[1:05:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> even thought the claymore is upgraded
[1:05:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hmm, will we see a magic or enchanted claymore i wonder
[1:05:46] <Johannen> Is changing the jump to L3 a possibility in remaster?
[1:05:52] <+Shishi1205> @Johannen yes
[1:05:53] <%Artoo__The_Me> Any big points I missed? Just got on stream
[1:05:58] <Puhff> PUT IT ALL IN ATTUNEMENt
[1:05:58] <Equirah> @fruit_pie_the_magician yeah, strighout
[1:06:03] <scarman125> I wish the Moonlight Greatsword wasn't such a pain in the ass to get in this game
[1:06:05] <youngking_kush> I think Magic Weapon on an upgraded weapon is better than actually Enchanting your weapon
[1:06:05] <+Shishi1205> @Artoo__The_Me first try titanite catch pole drop
[1:06:09] <%KevinsLunchbox> Reggie still a claymore chad. nice
[1:06:12] <DedlokPM> @Artoo__The_Me beat the titianite demon and got the catch pole
[1:06:15] <Slim_Lipid> @Johannen is that really an improvement tho? truly?
[1:06:18] <+patel347> almost time for the rock
[1:06:22] <%Artoo__The_Me> @shishi1205 Thankies!
[1:06:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> fuck the hand axr
[1:06:31] <subjectg> @slim_lipid you don’t jump during a sprint for one
[1:06:31] <Treasure_Vault> Getting stats enough to hold a weapon then rushing 40 endurance is big fun
[1:06:33] <warpiscute> remember the good old days when the flip ring gave you a fast roll at <50% equip load
[1:06:43] <Johannen> @Slim_Lipid Reggie showing right now why it is an option
[1:06:56] <andre11dr> I saw last stream that people where worried about his built, but rolling around with a Soul Spear and Great Combustion is VERY viable
[1:07:01] <subjectg> instead of this put the stick in neutral poppycock
[1:07:04] <Johannen> Change the input to L3

[1:41:49] <Xaeveax> No you hang up
[1:41:50] <%dreadedcthulhu> woolie the betrayer LMOA
[1:41:50] <AvroEltz> LET HIM SUFFER
[1:41:50] <%fetrigon> how many souls? woolieKICKDAD
[1:41:51] <%xjn_> lobosDied
[1:41:51] <+esoteric_simp> it was my fault
[1:41:51] <glass_marcus> 60/40
[1:41:52] <%Rafraud> But yeah Reggie just wiffed lol
[1:41:52] <+robertoszek> that went well LUL
[1:41:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's fine 4k isn't that much
[1:41:54] <@Solidus_113> that's a comfy back seat
[1:41:54] <Puhff> F
[1:41:55] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[1:41:56] <+tempestzephyr> a little bit woolie's fault
[1:41:56] <%Rafraud> S A L T
[1:41:57] <VincentGraves> dude just let him choose how to play
[1:41:57] <AvroEltz> AT HIS OWN ACCORD
[1:41:59] <MeImoth> yeah 3 of these can fuck you up
[1:42:00] <%Lion_kun> Reggie is fucking up a lot because of his constant switching
[1:42:01] <Ros_Bef> LUL
[1:42:01] <Treasure_Vault> What a comedy of errors
[1:42:02] <+Jiggisnipe> gotta hit them Kappa
[1:42:07] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Fun fact, if you don't go for the bait item those guys will never bother you
[1:42:08] <kikoeru_san> He needed to put his shield up
[1:42:08] <+Shishi1205> If you pick the item they go out
[1:42:08] <+ALazo> reggie vastly overestimates the range of the claymore
[1:42:09] <+rubeSandwich> Ladies it’s everyone’s fault
[1:42:10] <andre11dr> I wouldn't hate the Alva set so much if not EVERYONE used it and THE SAME GREATSWORD the first time they play
[1:42:11] <+kinmarik> stole the man's life like pie
[1:42:13] <+the_420_dachshund> he was good with the pyro
[1:42:13] <Hoodywolf> whip him real good
[1:42:20] <%Rafraud> All is forgiven
[1:42:21] <%Lion_kun> He needs to train himself to default back to the attack spell
[1:42:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> Reggie got too much going on with Pyro and Magic
[1:42:27] <youngking_kush> I think I've had them not follow before too
[1:42:28] <%Solidnick18> that is for bleed
[1:42:31] <+swesterly> You net 4K every time you clear the enemies in this area, no big loss tbh
[1:42:36] <oda_flobunaga> With all this switching, Reggie would have some real trouble with Nioh
[1:42:37] <+Shishi1205> the worst moss
[1:42:42] <Treasure_Vault> @ALazo This means Reggie needs BIGGER SWORD
[1:42:49] <%Rafraud> I think Reggie needs to get a better pyro spell if he wants to keep it going
[1:42:56] <+swesterly> This area is actually a good early farm
[1:42:59] <subjectg> @andre11dr true, that and the drangleic set, havel’s and smelter helm have really lost all cool factor in pvp
[1:43:02] <oda_flobunaga> Menstral Moss
[1:43:03] <kikoeru_san> Reggie need a BLESS sword

[1:45:12] <+sriracha_pon> Hell yeah! Get to pokin!!!
[1:45:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's not doing spears yet, i doubt he'll do it now
[1:45:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> toothpick pog
[1:45:18] <+Sir_Louis> its a good one!
[1:45:21] <%Josef_Stryker> Especially in DS2 where u can dual wield them
[1:45:24] <Klefth> This weapon is such a tragedy. SUCH a cool moveset, such shit stats :/
[1:45:27] <velgaduere> "mainly because it reminded me of Zan Partizan"
[1:45:28] <%Solidnick18> use whatever but it's fine
[1:45:28] <+Reverend_Roscoe> everybody shut up, spears are great
[1:45:33] <+twohitgood> spears aren't very good damage-wise but they're a unique gameplay style.
[1:45:35] <kikoeru_san> The Partizan is one of the best weapons in the game
[1:45:35] <@Solidus_113> stinky
[1:45:36] <Johannen> Cause its not a Halberd
[1:45:38] <+kewlmyc> DROP YOUR FUCKING SHIELD
[1:45:39] <brunoberserk> '' Woolsworth killed gods ... with a FUCKING TOOTHPICK ''
[1:45:40] <AbnormalVoid> Partizan is good, people are haters
[1:45:44] <Crowroost> Just dont listen to past Pat and forget to pump damage stat(s) again
[1:45:47] <+Jiggisnipe> it's a spear not halberd
[1:45:48] <+mechslayer71> so it's the spear for bad players? Kappa Kappa
[1:45:49] <%CateHecate> toothpick souls
[1:45:50] <subjectg> the halberd damage is sooo much better for pve, this is a pvp weapon
[1:45:52] <peachy996> I'll hate on the Partizan all day
[1:45:53] <+kewlmyc> Spears are fun though, in all seriousness
[1:46:03] <MinersLoveGames> Spears are incredibly versatile. I prefer the halberd, but I stuck with the spear for a while.
[1:46:04] <oneimportantthing> TOOTHPICK
[1:46:14] <kikoeru_san> Toothpic in DS3 is god-like
[1:46:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:46:17] <%Lion_kun> Now never touch it again.
[1:46:18] <andre11dr> My DS2 built was a partisan and a long sword, it was really cool ,like that Soul Caliber lady
[1:46:20] <AbnormalVoid> winged spear and silver knight spear are better
[1:46:21] <%sewermonk> tootpick is fine woolie, its ok
[1:46:23] <youngking_kush> Spears are cool in general but I mean
[1:46:24] <peachy996> a million and one things
[1:46:25] <+hax_metatron> It's a good weapon.  All weapons in From Soft games are good to beat the game.
[1:46:29] <+Shishi1205> thats usual for all areas in all souls
[1:46:39] <subjectg> partizan two-handed r2 in ds2 fucks
[1:46:40] <+twohitgood> yep. it's a certain way to approach the game. you get a benefit of keeping the shield up but give up some damage.
[1:46:48] <youngking_kush> Lubu made spears cool for all time
[1:46:54] <Klefth> Some spears are pretty good, like winged. It's just the numbers on the partizan are sad
[1:46:58] <+kewlmyc> I used the spear until I got the Great Scythe and never looked back.
[1:47:03] <+twohitgood> humanity is to summon an npc for some questline stuff.
[1:47:06] <kikoeru_san> Dragoons also make spears cool

[2:00:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:00:32] <QueequegTheater> @CateHecate @youngking_kush @IronOhki God looked upon the works of man and went "Yo that's rad"

[2:00:42] <blackpegaso> Kill the skeletons back in day
[2:00:43] <peachy996> He's embarrassed
[2:00:44] <@Menitta> dont give up skeleton

[2:01:15] <peachy996> God is embarrassed about making the skeleton so he covered it up with skin muscle and organs
[2:01:17] <andre11dr> Even tho gods in this universe are not really gods
[2:01:17] <+cdrom321> Gaping gave 25,000.
[2:01:27] <%IronOhki> Throw me a bone. Okay. (literally)
[2:01:30] <+Stormiercashew> or you can just fall down the tower like I do every single time
[2:01:44] <Puhff> My favorite is the picture of the Ukrainian Orthodox priest defending his church with a riot shield
[2:01:48] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater And on the eight day the Lord said "Parry this, casual"
[2:01:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> More fireballs?
[2:01:57] <Crowroost> Face the bloodshed and de-bone God
[2:02:00] <%IronOhki> I just recently started a pyromancer and holy eff is fireball broken in early game.
[2:02:05] <+paladinstarbuster> FIRE ORB
[2:02:12] <Darren716> Did Reggie meat with Pyro bro at firelink?
[2:02:13] <%IronOhki> @paladinstarbuster Wrong stream.
[2:02:13] <Jaysky> @queequegtheater That would explain the Gwyn fight
[2:02:14] <sendart> that doesnt work with magic weapon
[2:02:16] <+cdrom321> @queequegtheater You said that to yourself?
[2:02:29] <KaiserMario> Oh yeah, forgtot Reggie had 3 sluts already
[2:02:32] <KaiserMario> *slots
[2:02:33] <Puhff> I really dislike this Twitch chat thread feature cuz it makes it look like people are talking to themselves
[2:02:35] <+cdrom321> @darren716 At least once.
[2:02:37] <Klefth> Combustion is the shit, man
[2:02:38] <subjectg> @crowroost dehumanize yourself and face to bloodshed
[2:02:40] <DapperCadavr> Reggie also got a key!
[2:02:41] <%CateHecate> and you can duel wield magic and swords
[2:02:45] <+paladinstarbuster> @paladinstarbuster ???
[2:02:51] <Treasure_Vault> @KaiserMario No, you were right the first time
[2:02:51] <%Lion_kun> Only the top part
[2:02:56] <%IronOhki> @paladinstarbuster Pat is the fire orb.
[2:02:57] <pochecito> @KaiserMario "sluts"
[2:02:59] <QueequegTheater> @cdrom321 Nope.  That's just how threads work
[2:03:03] <%CateHecate> B E R Y    G O O D
[2:03:05] <Equirah> item!
[2:03:07] <+paladinstarbuster> @paladinstarbuster LUL
[2:03:07] <Darren716> And now you can get an even better ring
[2:03:09] <%IronOhki> @CateHecate H E L L O
[2:03:13] <jumpyhugs> 2nd best medium armour, too
[2:03:14] <%Solidnick18> and learned some lessons
[2:03:15] <zashrin777> P O I S E

[2:03:21] <%Solidnick18> depends
[2:03:22] <Puhff> ....excuse me?
[2:03:23] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:03:23] <VJdarkworld> ?
[2:03:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> don't make it lame reggie
[2:03:25] <Jaysky> I M  S O R R Y
[2:03:25] <Nogopharo> what ring did he get?
[2:03:28] <peachy996> Huh?
[2:03:29] <+Rasheedt> bruh
[2:03:29] <Puhff> a diaper????
[2:03:31] <%Deekman> It's diapers for adults
[2:03:34] <Crowroost> Titanite Diapers
[2:03:36] <penitentpendant> Would put an interesting twist on "Poise Boise". But I don't think so.
[2:03:36] <%X2Eliah> Poise *is* for babbies
[2:03:37] <Slimperton> @Nogopharo Wolf
[2:03:37] <KyberNasse> Hmm??
[2:03:39] <%Seancicle> is this a joke to you Reggie
[2:03:39] <%IronOhki> @Nogopharo Wolf ring I think? The poise ring.
[2:03:40] <subjectg> do those diapers prevent babies from staggering?
[2:03:43] <+cdrom321> Adult diapers.
[2:03:44] <%CodenameChaz> Poise is indeed a brand of adult diapers
[2:03:45] <peachy996> Maybe we should move on from this train of thought
[2:03:46] <+cubbywolf> adults need diapers top. just look at Pat
[2:03:47] <%Fefe41> wut ring he got bithc
[2:03:50] <%IronOhki> @subjectg Definitely.
[2:03:52] <%Indigo_Automaton> Diaper Armor
[2:03:54] <glass_marcus> wolf
[2:03:56] <peachy996> run away from it even
[2:03:58] <+cubbywolf> too*
[2:03:59] <+NahmenJayden> is this new reggie lore?
[2:03:59] <%X2Eliah> Ohhh so Poise is "elegant" diapers
[2:04:01] <youngking_kush> @subjectg Depends.
[2:04:02] <+Breaknoon> stream diapers
[2:04:05] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Poise does Pads and liners
[2:04:06] <DapperCadavr> he's Also got basin left right?
[2:04:06] <+TheFrancix> havel time?
[2:04:08] <+Shishi1205> bro those magic rings are expensive
[2:04:09] <+athuramn> They're pads and liners you weirdos
[2:04:12] <+TheFrancix> ah wait
[2:04:12] <+HeroSolaire> This shield was a design made by a fan right
[2:04:13] <%IronOhki> Hey he beat titanite.
[2:04:23] <+cubbywolf> ah poise is for the ladies
[2:04:26] <+Shishi1205> Is Karmic Justice the most expensive thing in the game? Its 40k
[2:04:28] <andre11dr> This reminds me of those DS3 pants that are literally filled with shit
[2:04:33] <pixel_river> chunky
[2:04:33] <merrja> chunky
[2:04:35] <+Jack8274> That helmet sucks so much haha, the weight is way too high
[2:04:36] <subjectg> @herosolaire i thought the fan design shields were in ds2?
[2:04:37] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:04:38] <%Solidnick18> oh
[2:04:39] <%Ensign_Epic> This titanite demo isn't that bad especially if he was reliably killing the Dark Knight
[2:04:40] <sendart> wrong shield on
[2:04:40] <%CodenameChaz> @IronOhki Second try too
[2:04:40] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:04:40] <SarcFa> wrong shield, that's why fat roll
[2:04:41] <merrja> LUL
[2:04:41] <+pectusumbra> is elite armor lighter than chain?
[2:04:41] <Johannen> Wrong shield
[2:04:41] <+cdrom321> @herosolaire Which shield?
[2:04:45] <Carlioo> wait you wanted diapers???
[2:04:45] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:04:46] <penitentpendant> Poise... Goise?
[2:04:46] <+cubbywolf> chunky and frothy
[2:04:46] <%livlinn> tampon??
[2:04:48] <sendart> knight shield sucks
[2:04:51] <+Breaknoon> aint gotta be old :3
[2:04:51] <%Indigo_Automaton> Hey you could use those to plug up your stab wounds
[2:04:51] <youngking_kush> It's the shield
[2:04:52] <%BisoromiBear> Huggies sounds like Smash terminology
[2:04:52] <Crowroost> !! BLEEDING !!
[2:04:53] <+Archphronimos> your shield
[2:04:54] <Johannen> Knight Shield
[2:04:57] <peachy996> Okay Reggie Stoklasa
[2:04:59] <%robosqueeb> old people tampons monkaS
[2:05:00] <QueequegTheater> Tampons are jusst pussy diapers
[2:05:00] <youngking_kush> That's not the one he was using
[2:05:01] <andre11dr> Wrong shield Reggie
[2:05:04] <%IronOhki> I mean those are the HEAVY boots.
[2:05:04] <brandt_connors> or lighter top
[2:05:11] <+cubbywolf> old people don't need tampons
[2:05:11] <+Breaknoon> old people dont need tampons bruh
[2:05:12] <+Jack8274> The helmet has terrible stats to weight ratio
[2:05:15] <Johannen> wrong shield
[2:05:18] <subjectg> New lore: Artorias is as strong as he is because he’s wearing tampons
[2:05:20] <+Jiggisnipe> @WoolieVersus he was usiing a different shield
[2:05:20] <+cubbywolf> LUL high-five bro
[2:05:25] <Slimperton> heavy boots - light
[2:05:26] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 Crystal Soul Spear is 50k
[2:05:27] <Hoodywolf> what an odd mishmash
[2:05:28] <%Irridium> embrace fat roll

[2:05:37] <+Breaknoon> @cubbywolf hivemind
[2:05:37] <@Solidus_113> boar helm only
[2:05:37] <Teradyne87> Yes, old people, the largest market for tampon use
[2:05:40] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 Makes sense, thats a good one
[2:05:41] <zashrin777> @subjectg i reject you
[2:05:42] <+cdrom321> @herosolaire The design contest winner is the blood shield in the Painted World.
[2:05:44] <+kraajkase> @Jack8274 but fashion tho
[2:05:53] <+askalta> it's way heavy
[2:05:59] <Johannen> Reggie was using another shield before that
[2:06:06] <%Ensign_Epic> Also knight shield is one of the worst shields in the game, prolly the worst medium shield
[2:06:06] <youngking_kush> No, he was using the Balder Shield
[2:06:06] <brandt_connors> is he using the Knight Shield?
[2:06:15] <AbnormalVoid> lmao
[2:06:17] <oda_flobunaga> Baller Swag Shield?
[2:06:21] <velgaduere> ... huh
[2:06:21] <AbnormalVoid> slowpoke.jpg
[2:06:21] <%Ensign_Epic> Meanwhile Baller Swag Shield is one of the best
[2:06:22] <+Breaknoon> a youtuber removed his beard and it's terrible
[2:06:24] <+Jiggisnipe> there's your clue
[2:06:36] <andre11dr> He also looks a lot like Gwyn, hmmmmmmmm Kappa
[2:06:50] <%IronOhki> @Jiggisnipe It's crazy how many straight up walkthrough clues people give you if you just listen to them.
[2:06:55] <+Breaknoon> Gwen got all them side kids
[2:07:02] <Equirah> just use the catchpole at that point
[2:07:07] <sendart> except thats faith not int LUL
[2:07:08] <youngking_kush> & Scales Faith
[2:07:11] <oda_flobunaga> LIKE THE CATCHPOLE
[2:07:18] <scarman125> unfortunately split damage in DS! is ass
[2:07:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1457949040566575106?t=WRD3hhRxnZrnVQfqKaaqMA&s=19
[2:07:21] <AbnormalVoid> it also scales with Divine
[2:07:25] <scarman125> DS1 even
[2:07:27] <AbnormalVoid> or uh
[2:07:29] <+Shishi1205> big number
[2:07:29] <AbnormalVoid> Faith
[2:07:35] <subjectg> Split damage is always ass for some reason
[2:07:41] <subjectg> except maybe in ds2 Kappa
[2:07:44] <%Ensign_Epic> DID REGGIE FUCKING GET THE CATCHPOLE I HAVE BEEN FARMING 12HRS FOR
[2:07:49] <zashrin777> The power of choir boys in this game feels excellent
[2:07:52] <+Shishi1205> Lucile
[2:07:57] <Equirah> @Ensign_Epic 1st try
[2:08:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Isn't it always better to go physical and use buffs?
[2:08:02] <%vVAstrAVv> woolie acts like nothing resists physical
[2:08:08] <%Ensign_Epic> @Ensign_Epic MOTHER OF FUCK
[2:08:09] <+Breaknoon> insane luck
[2:08:16] <oda_flobunaga> I'm going to let you finish but the Dancer Twin Blades are the best DS3 weapon
[2:08:20] <AbnormalVoid> Split Damage is fine in DS1, it just fails when up against something that resists one of the types
[2:08:20] <+Shishi1205> The drakes are super tanky to lightning which is funny bc dragons are supposed to be weak to thunder
[2:08:25] <youngking_kush> He also has Magic Weapon tho
[2:08:31] <QueequegTheater> Then Woolie doubled down and refused to stop using the Kirin spear
[2:08:33] <+cdrom321> @shishi1205 More like OOlucile.
[2:08:34] <KeiganOfAstora> Big number go smash
[2:08:37] <QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:08:38] <%hiswill98> Also adds scaling
[2:08:46] <%Ensign_Epic> Catchpole & Oolacile catalyst are all I have left
[2:08:51] <andre11dr> I never remembered the resistance of any of the bosses ,i usually speck my int builts so that they do enough damage no matter what
[2:09:15] <%Ensign_Epic> Oolacile catalyst only has 0.5% chance of dropping, but the enemies die in one hit
[2:09:28] <%Ensign_Epic> Meanwhile the respawning titanite demon is essentially a miniboss
[2:09:31] <QueequegTheater> He also could upgrade the Uchi if he really needs a divine weapon later
[2:09:40] <youngking_kush> Also can't use Magic Weapon on a weapon like that
[2:09:49] <%krispen_wa> THEM DEVIL WEAPONS
[2:09:50] <@Solidus_113> fire to chaos
[2:09:58] <QueequegTheater> THEM DEVIL WEAPONS
[2:09:58] <+Jiggisnipe> Lucifer status
[2:09:59] <%Josef_Stryker> Smithing is so needlessly complicated in DeS and DS1
[2:10:01] <+Dakuu75> Tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink... tink...
[2:10:01] <subjectg> i’ve never seen anyone use occult weapons tbh
[2:10:09] <+RyTYoung> DEM DEVIL GAMES WOOLIE
[2:10:11] <%Josef_Stryker> Thank god DS2 and 3 is just "Find a rock"
[2:10:12] <asakura_ayase> Devil weapons
[2:10:13] <andre11dr> Sadly the divine and occult weapons suck ass
[2:10:14] <AbnormalVoid> there's a next level for everything
[2:10:18] <%andrewofbob> Devil Arms?
[2:10:18] <%vVAstrAVv> read your bible to worship satan
[2:10:19] <Crowroost> In the God vs Skeleton debate, Occult IS the opposite of Divine LUL
[2:10:20] <TheyCallMeVawn> One more god rejected. Embrace True Demon Ending.
[2:10:22] <%Lion_kun> CHAOS
[2:10:23] <+TheFrancix> THEM DEVIL WEAPONS
[2:10:23] <+patriotrenegade> Fire ++
[2:10:24] <%krispen_wa> occult weapons are just for edgy roleplaying
[2:10:26] <AbnormalVoid> except the ones naturally second tier and raw
[2:10:26] <%Josef_Stryker> CHAOS
[2:10:30] <%Ensign_Epic> Occult weapons are... an interesting idea in theory but not worth it in practice
[2:10:30] <Darren716> I had a divine claymore that was pretty rad
[2:10:49] <AbnormalVoid> Mmmmm
[2:10:49] <DapperCadavr> He still has the basin to check out right chat?
[2:10:52] <@Solidus_113> mmmmm
[2:10:52] <%Juriasu> Hmm...
[2:10:53] <%Josef_Stryker> Hmmmm
[2:10:54] <%Solidnick18> mmmmmm
[2:10:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> Hmmmmmm
[2:10:56] <oda_flobunaga> Try swinging?
[2:10:58] <+Breaknoon> DaS1 has the best ambient sounds, good game to leave running in the background, for naps too.
[2:10:58] <asakura_ayase> Still closed still closed hmmmmm
[2:10:58] <%xjn_> lolol
[2:11:00] <%IronOhki> Wallmart
[2:11:01] <Equirah> @Ensign_Epic except in DS2
[2:11:01] <+Shishi1205> what do occult weapons scale from ?
[2:11:03] <andre11dr> Chaos and lighting are the only two that a are worth ,sadly
[2:11:05] <%Solidnick18> still closed
[2:11:07] <%xjn_> first in line for a ps5
[2:11:09] <+patel347> blight con
[2:11:15] <sendart> occult is the faith version of enchated
[2:11:18] <Johannen> @Shishi1205 still faith i believe
[2:11:21] <%Ensign_Epic> Yeah, go to the Asylum for that ring before Blighttown
[2:11:25] <+pectusumbra> ehhhh
[2:11:25] <%Lion_kun> Try deep root basin
[2:11:26] <Darren716> Use it nerd
[2:11:28] <%Solidnick18> that soul
[2:11:32] <%X2Eliah> BURN IT
[2:11:32] <+patel347> first boss soul
[2:11:32] <@Solidus_113> it's only like 2k
[2:11:34] <youngking_kush> NO
[2:11:37] <+Shishi1205> its low
[2:11:41] <Crowroost> Painted World has Velka's Rapier and Anor Londo has Occult Club, right before two relevant "God"bosses for it (O+S, Gwyndolin)
[2:11:44] <+patriotrenegade> Feed it to Frampt
[2:11:45] <andre11dr> It's just 2k
[2:11:46] <%Lion_kun> If reg is going int, he should not use the butterfly soul.
[2:11:57] <@Solidus_113> also frampt will give you 8k for it after you wake him up
[2:11:57] <zashrin777> CONSOOOM
[2:11:59] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[2:12:01] <andre11dr> But you'll never use the stupid horne
[2:12:03] <Darren716> Eh he can always go magic claymore
[2:12:04] <QueequegTheater> Moonlight doesn't give many souls anyway
[2:12:04] <Deko_> nft souls
[2:12:06] <%Ensign_Epic> @Crowroost Never actually connected that, nice
[2:12:09] <+Jiggisnipe> can get souls another way
[2:12:10] <+Shishi1205> yeah frampt likes stonk souls
[2:12:11] <+cdrom321> @ensign_epic He already has the rusted iron ring.
[2:12:12] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> That face is horrifying
[2:12:12] <sendart> butterfly spear sucks by the time you can get it sadly
[2:12:13] <zzNamttamzz> The shield is cool tho
[2:12:14] <lyzejag> Booba
[2:12:16] <+pectusumbra> butterfly horn is worth looking at for int if he's not going to use catchpole
[2:12:16] <Darren716> Like he's nearly at the green grind spot
[2:12:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> This hallow of a man
[2:12:25] <+Jiggisnipe> eff that
[2:12:28] <%krispen_wa> CONSUM
[2:12:30] <Crowroost> SPEAR with INT Woolie, i beg u
[2:12:30] <zashrin777> look at that adonis of an undead
[2:12:31] <%CateHecate> put reggarth back in, he aint done yet
[2:12:43] <Johannen> Shield is a cooler choice
[2:12:52] <+Dakuu75> Woolie with the fextralife page open. <3
[2:12:55] <@Solidus_113> clear out the Basin if you wanted more souls
[2:13:09] <BurdRightsActivist> @Dakuu75 DS1 Wikidot, get that Dextralife out of here
[2:13:10] <QueequegTheater> Use wikidot instead Woolie
[2:13:12] <+Shishi1205> basin you have the key
[2:13:14] <blackpegaso> The shield for it is cool
[2:13:20] <%krispen_wa> HORN
[2:13:20] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> A Special... K
[2:13:21] <Darren716> I mean if he fights the rock and hydra he'll have enough
[2:13:22] <%CateHecate> blightcon! blightcon! blightcon!
[2:13:23] <Finaldragoon> even fandom is better than fextralife
[2:13:25] <velgaduere> honk
[2:13:26] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Shield can do projectiles
[2:13:26] <%Solidnick18> doot
[2:13:28] <andre11dr> Shield could be cool, but still doubt he'll use it ,his shield is better anyway
[2:13:34] <%Ensign_Epic> @Dakuu75 100%, fextra isn't as terrible for DS1 but Wikidot blows it outta the water
[2:13:34] <%IronOhki> That is correct, Reggie.
[2:13:35] <glass_marcus> I hate how fextra life always shows up first in searches
[2:13:37] <@Solidus_113> correct
[2:13:38] <Crowroost> Spear is one of the better INT scaling weapons in the game, Shield is the game's best MAG def shield.
[2:13:38] <SarcFa> he was using the balder swag shield, now he's using the knight shield
[2:13:42] <%Bread_Assassin> Who is Woolie talking about? Frampt?
[2:13:45] <+NahmenJayden> Tears for Spears
[2:13:45] <sendart> god the knight shield sucks for its weight
[2:13:46] <%vVAstrAVv> TELL HIM THEYRE BOTH INT WEAPONS
[2:13:47] <MeImoth> that spear is fun with high INT
[2:13:53] <+Shishi1205> @bread_assassin ye
[2:13:59] <+robertoszek> heavy shield still on
[2:14:16] <Johannen> wrong shield
[2:14:25] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Basin for souls?
[2:14:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:28] <andre11dr> @meimoth But still, why would you use that when MLB exists
[2:14:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:14:36] <Johannen> Balder Shield is the winner
[2:14:37] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie forgot, Woolie told him about the shield
[2:14:41] <%Lion_kun> Go to the basin.
[2:14:48] <DapperCadavr> @WoolieVersus you also got a key you didn't read
[2:14:55] <%Ensign_Epic> @sendart It may be the worst medium shield in the game
[2:14:55] <+Shishi1205> yeah the key
[2:14:55] <+robertoszek> cleaning the forest was like 4k
[2:14:56] <QueequegTheater> I swear if he gets the BSS
[2:15:02] <%IronOhki> If we get down to the depths, you can grind 5 -> 10 titanite.
[2:15:05] <Darren716> He should check out the basement

[2:15:23] <Crowroost> Wait, I just realized, he defeated Gaping, why aren't we in FPSTown rn?
[2:15:24] <%IronOhki> @IronOhki I have burned so many slimes.

[2:15:42] <QueequegTheater> @Crowroost Woolie wanted to show him the other paths
[2:15:45] <+Jiggisnipe> I just think about Plague's video LUL
[2:15:45] <%IronOhki> @BurdRightsActivist Is it weird that I heard that in Blaze the Cat's voice?
[2:15:48] <+patriotrenegade> I can stop the Rock

[2:16:33] <%IronOhki> Golden Boy!
[2:16:36] <%Ensign_Epic> Lautrec
[2:16:36] <Klefth> There's a REALLY good ring in that tower
[2:16:37] <Johannen> He bought Conbustion from him
[2:16:41] <%Ensign_Epic> ?
[2:16:44] <Crowroost> Dwayne "Geodude" The Havel Johnson
[2:16:44] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[2:16:46] <velgaduere> funny how he changed the wording from... ROCK...
[2:16:50] <+pectusumbra> the pyro, yeah. he bought combust and got his flame upgrade
[2:16:53] <%IronOhki> MORE FIRE
[2:16:56] <%IronOhki> FIRE GO UP
[2:16:58] <velgaduere> that thing you can't stop...
[2:17:01] <andre11dr> He has Combustion Woolie
[2:17:02] <%Solidnick18> oh him
[2:17:06] <%IronOhki> ORB
[2:17:11] <+Jiggisnipe> you told him to say no because he asked a question weird
[2:17:13] <Klefth> Modify that shit
[2:17:15] <andre11dr> ORB
[2:17:16] <%Ensign_Epic> Okay, so he did NOT free Lautrec, or just killed him?
[2:17:19] <%IronOhki> It's okay to be wrong, if you really want to, Reggie.
[2:17:34] <Klefth> @Ensign_Epic He did free Lautrec
[2:17:41] <%CateHecate> the fire rises
[2:17:52] <oda_flobunaga> We are born in the Crunch, warmed by the Crunch
[2:17:57] <%Ensign_Epic> Oh does the fire only go out after a boss, forgot
[2:17:57] <andre11dr> He should upgrade his pyro hand
[2:18:04] <Johannen> @Ensign_Epic Even if you dont free him he gets out
[2:18:04] <%Artoo__The_Me> Shhhh
[2:18:09] <linSP> DA FIRE
[2:18:12] <subjectg> @ensign_epic it’s a trigger in blighttown
[2:18:23] <%IronOhki> I think he's my favorite NPC. Tarkus, Solaire, and Siegmeyer, all so wonderful, but I love Laurentius.
[2:18:23] <Jaysky> This guy was my favorite npc for a long time.
[2:18:24] <andre11dr> She tall
[2:18:25] <%Ensign_Epic> okay, it's literally the door, gotcha
[2:18:29] <%IronOhki> @Jaysky My man.
[2:18:34] <+RyTYoung> cup-a-flame
[2:18:42] <Jaysky> He's just a cool dude
[2:18:45] <MinersLoveGames> Favorite NPC right here. He's so polite.
[2:18:47] <Crowroost> And the same curiosity will get laurentius to bork himself if you mess up...
[2:19:00] <%Ensign_Epic> Been a while since I did an "intended way" run so usually I just rock up to Firelink and randomly find it out
[2:19:02] <%Deekman> Would Lutrec have moved on yet?
[2:19:03] <Jaysky> @ironohki nyannBuff1
[2:19:14] <+Dakuu75> being undead... (gasp) I can survive untill Bloodborne 2 is made~!
[2:19:17] <%CateHecate> weirdly enough, pyromancy being you physically manifesting the spark of conciousness that makes you human makes it way closer to real-world ritual magic than anything else in most fantasy
[2:19:20] <%Deekman> oh wait obviously not lol
[2:19:21] <justcallmebobplease> Has Woolie shown Reggie the drake-based farming trick on the bridge by this point?

[2:21:31] <Crowroost> The balder grind commenceth
[2:21:37] <Darren716> Can he still grind on the bridge?
[2:21:40] <%CateHecate> kill petrus
[2:21:43] <Darren716> Or is the drake gone now?
[2:21:52] <+Galeont> Hey Woolie, hope you're doing well. Working on finishing DD1 now and I'm having my best run yet. 2 final quests down with only 1 death
[2:21:56] <zashrin777> Lautrec just needs a good warm hug
[2:21:56] <%Deekman> still didn't do the drake sword
[2:21:56] <andre11dr> We can also get the zwei
[2:22:04] <andre11dr> He never hot it
[2:22:05] <QueequegTheater> @Galeont god damn
[2:22:06] <Darren716> Because that gives you 555 every 20 seconds or so
[2:22:06] <+YungSkywacka> No Drake Sword?
[2:22:08] <Treasure_Vault> Didn't Reggie get the zwei and box it?
[2:22:13] <Johannen> @Deekman What you mean? He has it on him
[2:22:13] <+pectusumbra> would pay to use the mace as well
[2:22:15] <+heros_lucatero> zweihandler POGGERS
[2:22:19] <Crowroost> We're not grinding the Balder bois for a BSS? Whilst farming?
[2:22:19] <+robertoszek> advice at risk
[2:22:21] <+Rasheedt> @treasure_vault yes
[2:22:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a lot more doable now
[2:22:24] <@Solidus_113> hasn't tried the zwei yet, but he has it
[2:22:30] <+pectusumbra> this works
[2:22:32] <+TheFrancix> yoooo scimitar
[2:22:33] <%Deekman> @Johannen he's not using it
[2:22:39] <Darren716> And put your grasses on
[2:22:40] <+Jiggisnipe> your 6god sword Kappa
[2:22:40] <QueequegTheater> Can't buff the Drake
[2:22:41] <%Ensign_Epic> Really should go to the dragon farm if he wants souls
[2:22:42] <merrja> put your grasses on
[2:22:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie chose the eminem sword instead
[2:22:49] <%Juriasu> as long as they die
[2:22:50] <sendart> is the drake sword even better now?
[2:22:51] <%Ensign_Epic> but I get it, this is actual gameplay
[2:23:02] <+Shishi1205> isn't the claymore better?
[2:23:07] <pixel_river> SourPls
[2:23:07] <+theoldone001> We sticking with the Knight Shield?
[2:23:09] <andre11dr> I think his Claymore dose more damage tho
[2:23:13] <%CateHecate> its called the drake sword because it stops being around once youre past soul level 18
[2:23:14] <AbnormalVoid> Skeletons weak to Strike damage
[2:23:23] <zashrin777> @CateHecate damm
[2:23:24] <Equirah> if we're talking about better it'd be the catchpole Kappa
[2:23:24] <%Ensign_Epic> @CateHecate holy shit lmao

[2:24:45] <Iza_kku> thanks chat
[2:24:47] <+YungSkywacka> Did he kill the necromancer?
[2:24:50] <andre11dr> Reggie still hasn't changed the shield
[2:24:52] <Darren716> These ones don't resurrect, only the ones down below
[2:24:56] <%Juriasu> death is coming
[2:24:58] <+patriotrenegade> This is Paige's wet dream

[2:25:24] <andre11dr> PUT THE SHIELD BACK ONNNN
[2:25:27] <zk_nails> SPINAL
[2:25:27] <Treasure_Vault> This is not a good farming spot, i believe
[2:25:28] <+KaguraRaion> Dont drink NotLikeThis
[2:25:28] <KumaTorey> blood fell out!!!!
[2:25:29] <Crowroost> Scottt Stamina vs The Stack
[2:25:30] <+eanscrale> Fun fact, they used to not drop souls.
[2:25:32] <QueequegTheater> @KyberNasse That's not happening
[2:25:33] <BurdRightsActivist> Is nobody gonna tell Reggie about the Bafmodads he needs to grab under Taurus Demon?
[2:25:33] <%vVAstrAVv> panic drink. recipe for death
[2:25:35] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus he's using the wrong shield
[2:25:37] <Johannen> Balder Shield was better for weight
[2:25:48] <%Ensign_Epic> This is an actual dog farming spot against enemies whom he cannot damage efficiently
[2:25:49] <+pectusumbra> magic weapon the drake sword and you'll be fine I think
[2:25:51] <Equirah> @Johannen and stability
[2:25:54] <sendart> woolie hates consumables
[2:25:56] <@Solidus_113> try it
[2:25:56] <KyberNasse> @queequegtheater Dark Souls 2
[2:25:59] <Darren716> Drake Bridge is amazing for grinding
[2:26:07] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[2:26:07] <Klefth> @pectusumbra You can't
[2:26:12] <+pectusumbra> ah, got ya
[2:26:14] <Kain5707> heater shield is strong and light
[2:26:18] <Darren716> like just climb the ladder and duck down for 555 free souls
[2:26:19] <+swesterly> It’s not the most efficient when the purpose is farming
[2:26:21] <Scorchfield> yeah knight shield looks neat but its worse stat wise
[2:26:31] <%Ensign_Epic> @Kain5707 it ALSO has small shield parry frames
[2:26:37] <Kain5707> it sure dpes
[2:26:46] <Equirah> might as well try the catchpole on these guys Kappa
[2:26:48] <Kain5707> its arguably the best shield
[2:26:54] <Equirah> see how he likes it Kappa
[2:27:00] <+eanscrale> Nothing quite tells an invader everything they need to know more than the Knight Shield.
[2:27:08] <Johannen> @Ensign_Epic Wut, no it does not, its a middle shield, small shields have a totaly different animation
[2:27:13] <AbnormalVoid> @WoolieVersus that's not what divine means
[2:27:19] <merrja> drink that sunny d
[2:27:29] <%Ensign_Epic> @Johannen It totally does, it's the only medium shield that has the same parry window
[2:27:29] <scarman125> awful time to drink
[2:27:38] <AbnormalVoid> Divine only applies to full-on resurrection, falling apart is just a stagger animation
[2:27:41] <zashrin777> @eanscrale LUL
[2:27:48] <+pectusumbra> hey, that works!
[2:27:50] <@Solidus_113> nice
[2:27:51] <+TheFrancix> LUL
[2:27:52] <%xjn_> noice
[2:27:54] <+swesterly> I feel like the safest and fastest farm at this point is probably darkroot garden tbh, you get ~4K by killing all the enemies in the main forest area
[2:27:55] <Klefth> Combustion is buuuusted
[2:28:01] <LunarRemix> Has he got the Zwei?
[2:28:09] <%xjn_> combustin makes me feel good
[2:28:09] <Basic_Birch_> The skeleton's that are stopped from getting back up with divine are the ones with glowing red eyes inside the catacombs
[2:28:13] <AbnormalVoid> Cum Busitn
[2:28:20] <+Rasheedt> @lunarremix yes
[2:28:20] <Crowroost> A LOT of things are faster than Fireball. #pyromorelikepy-slo
[2:28:25] <+Jiggisnipe> BIG HIT
[2:28:28] <andre11dr> Can't wait for great Combustion, that shit is BROOOOKEN
[2:28:31] <%Ensign_Epic> @eanscrale To be fair - don't think he needs to worry about that until Blighttown, he's at SLwhatever & WL+5 minimum due to having a unique weapon
[2:28:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:28:33] <+TheFrancix> DO NOT CHEESE THEME
[2:28:35] <Equirah> why do i think poise is just gonna teach reggie wrong lessons LUL

[2:28:42] <%Rafraud> SKELETON WARRIORS
[2:28:42] <+megaman_sentinel> not worth

[2:28:48] <Gelphaze> No cheese here sorry!
[2:28:48] <Johannen> One guy?
[2:28:48] <@Solidus_113> the resurrection is only when there's the necromancer around
[2:28:50] <Klefth> Resurrecting, not from getting back up after a crumple
[2:28:50] <JetpackMcQuack> good equipment is cheating
[2:28:51] <%Ensign_Epic> @swesterly This is actually the better farm, yeah, just stand in the safety spot
[2:28:54] <oda_flobunaga> Why not try Catchpole here?
[2:28:55] <AbnormalVoid> what are we grinding for again?
[2:29:05] <Darren716> Heavy soul arrow
[2:29:09] <scarman125> yes but skeletons in the graveyard don't resurrect
[2:29:09] <+robertoszek> @swesterly I think the same but maybe for lp purposes not redoing the same zone again and getting Reggie familiar with the skeleton moveset is better in the long run, idk
[2:29:09] <Treasure_Vault> I don't think this is ever the spot to farm
[2:29:10] <andre11dr> This farming route seems.,uhh BAD
[2:29:11] <@Solidus_113> if they give you no souls on "death" they'll revive
[2:29:12] <QueequegTheater> @AbnormalVoid Reggie wants Heavy Soul Arrow
[2:29:15] <AbnormalVoid> right
[2:29:21] <%Rafraud> I think most people do this without Divine though. Its doable
[2:29:23] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus you know what'd keep you safe? the conforting distance of a pole Kappa
[2:29:30] <Darren716> @woolieversus Drake Bridge!
[2:29:32] <Crowroost> But remember, always... That the last skeleton to defeat... is the one inside of us all...
[2:29:38] <shinichizio> Hot bones, get'cha hot bones
[2:29:46] <+paladinstarbuster> THERE WE GO
[2:29:51] <Treasure_Vault> Is the drake gone? I can't remember.
[2:29:57] <jumpyhugs> this is a shitty farming spot, for anyone watching at home
[2:30:03] <Equirah> drake is not gone
[2:30:03] <+Dakuu75> frigin home depot skeleton
[2:30:10] <%Rafraud> Oh wait this sword has divine?
[2:30:13] <Equirah> but he has to reset it
[2:30:14] <QueequegTheater> I've never seen such greed
[2:30:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I hope Reggie has a devine weapon
[2:30:25] <%Artoo__The_Me> Drake is still there, but has to trigger it on the bridge first before going back on the wall
[2:30:32] <+KennyKRool> Drop your shield?
[2:30:34] <andre11dr> Also, i don't know why Woolie told him to use the Drake sword, he waa doing way better with the Claymore
[2:30:34] <KumaTorey> so why we souls grinding now?
[2:30:35] <Crowroost> Nice binocs

[2:32:20] <+Dakuu75> Having fun Reggie my lad?
[2:32:20] <+twohitgood> you can hold down to quick switch back to estus.
[2:32:21] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus can you hold down on the dpad to quick go back to estus in this one?
[2:32:23] <Treasure_Vault> glad he has five things on the quickbar
[2:32:24] <+stantashev> But what if Regie has to black bomb
[2:32:24] <Chatterbox1991> notice how the Chosen Undead's grunts kinda sound like Reggie?
[2:32:24] <%Rafraud> CLEAN IT REGGIE
[2:32:27] <%Rafraud> PLEASE
[2:32:31] <peachy996> You have been Bone'd
[2:32:31] <+Rasheedt> NotLikeThis
[2:32:33] <AbnormalVoid> Is reggie using a 360 controller? Because it's really bad for changing a bunch of things on you when you don't want it to.
[2:32:34] <SarcFa> Reggie seems to be fat fingering down
[2:32:38] <justcallmebobplease> Reggie do you think a problem you don't even feel you understand, is just gonna go away if you ignore it?
[2:32:41] <+kinmarik> wait can't you hold down
[2:32:44] <+Jiggisnipe> oh wow didn't know that
[2:32:45] <JetpackMcQuack> keep those knives ready
[2:32:51] <@Solidus_113> that's a new feature

[2:32:59] <%Artoo__The_Me> That’s a remastered
[2:33:01] <+RyTYoung> I knew that, it's new to the remaster
[2:33:03] <+gitgouda> nice lil ds3 qol
[2:33:06] <Klefth> That's a remaster feature brought back from DS3
[2:33:06] <Crowroost> Just do a Parish grind, Woolie, you can simultaneously try for a BSS that way.
[2:33:06] <JetpackMcQuack> straight to slot 1
[2:33:07] <SilverFaustX> patched
[2:33:08] <+cubbywolf> I just went to woolies twitter and the Kite picture is great. The kite arc is true
[2:33:09] <nackenschelle2go> Reggie kills himself with his fat fingers
[2:33:13] <%hiswill98> You’ve got this Reggie!
[2:33:16] <+Jiggisnipe> YEA
[2:33:17] <%Rafraud> please god reggie

[2:33:26] <%IronOhki> Well then stop fucking up.
[2:33:26] <QueequegTheater> Now put the firebombs back on
[2:33:27] <velgaduere> you may not like it
[2:33:27] <Johannen> Change the jump to L3 also?
[2:33:28] <KeiganOfAstora> update
[2:33:28] <velgaduere> but accept it
[2:33:31] <+Jaromero435> but the never used knives NotLikeThis
[2:33:33] <Paperware> happens a lot when controllers that have one piece dpads
[2:33:33] <+blastyoboots> yup, Remastered
[2:33:34] <+twohitgood> it's a quality of life change they made.
[2:33:35] <SilverFaustX> i got accepted to elden ring test :)
[2:33:35] <justcallmebobplease> As opposed to what, Reggie - you fat fingering and fucking up your items?
[2:33:35] <velgaduere> wise words from Macho Man
[2:33:36] <andre11dr> And put the Claymore back on
[2:33:37] <nxflre> whaat I miss?
[2:33:37] <+cubbywolf> NEW TECH
[2:33:37] <+kinmarik> is reggie usopp?
[2:33:39] <jumpyhugs> @Crowroost does it look like he's doing a dex build?
[2:33:39] <%vVAstrAVv> its for the best reggie
[2:33:39] <%Rafraud> He never used kives
[2:33:40] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus it does that in all of them iirc
[2:33:43] <zashrin777> oh shit they added that in the remaster?
[2:33:43] <%Rafraud> knives
[2:33:48] <+megaman_sentinel> L3 4life
[2:33:48] <nxflre> Still no blightown?
[2:33:51] <%ZweihanderSteve> ZweihanderSteve subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! may the fire of reggarth burn forever, or at least till you run out of games lol \o/
[2:33:51] <0cash> keep the firebombs c:
[2:33:52] <user_naim> A man denied his trinkets
[2:33:57] <Equirah> LUL
[2:33:57] <+Rasheedt> @nxflre no
[2:33:58] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[2:33:59] <%Rafraud> Equip it when you actually need it reggie
[2:34:01] <%IronOhki> When Woolie played, it still added new items to the bar automatically.
[2:34:03] <Sleepsie_> It's so much fun watching Woolie become the coach after watching Pat bug him to "drop his shield" so many years ago naroEhehe
[2:34:03] <Qsmash_> built different
[2:34:03] <justcallmebobplease> Then do that, Reggie, see how it goes!
[2:34:05] <LunarRemix> Oof
[2:34:05] <+cubbywolf> reggie chooses to get gud
[2:34:08] <oda_flobunaga> Man, Nioh will fuck him up
[2:34:08] <+ThePich> just don't press down
[2:34:11] <NumbF4ke> Dont forget to check murakumo out
[2:34:12] <%hiswill98> If you want, just put the stuff back on Reggie
[2:34:15] <+Jiggisnipe> you weren't using alot of that stuff tbf
[2:34:17] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[2:34:20] <+cubbywolf> never use the fire bombs, you might need them later
[2:34:20] <Equirah> they're gonna throw hands LUL
[2:34:23] <yomamma133713> bloodborne's firebomb equivalent are amazing
[2:34:24] <0cash> letthhe man use his bombs
[2:34:26] <IamGreven> and when he uses them, he misses
[2:34:26] <%Prevot> LUL
[2:34:26] <%IronOhki> Go big then go home.
[2:34:35] <Treasure_Vault> One big guy is ten small guys.
[2:34:37] <+cubbywolf> give me your souls
[2:34:40] <%BananaSlammuh> So sad about it LUL
[2:34:43] <scarman125> this seems like a really inefficient soul farm
[2:34:43] <andre11dr> This is supposed to be a quick farming spot according to Woolie, but what i see is Reggie STRUGGLING LUL
[2:34:45] <wqorst> let reggie throw 1 bomb to get his morale up
[2:34:45] <%IronOhki> You... did it.
[2:34:45] <TenorSounds> He’d use firebombs if he didn’t have fireballs
[2:34:46] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL I like how the skeleton hates fire
[2:34:48] <+robertoszek> yata \o/
[2:34:49] <AbnormalVoid> should try out that murakumo
[2:34:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and check out that murakumo
[2:34:54] <shinichizio> Wait, souls? Not for the Murakumo?
[2:34:54] <justcallmebobplease> Fastest levelling right now is the drake clearing the bridge for you, 500 souls for climbing a ladder and doing a spin.
[2:34:55] <%Ensign_Epic> Firebombs are amazing, praise the Barker Bomb Bait
[2:34:57] <+kinmarik> I feel like the roped firebomb is great but i just dont get them
[2:34:57] <QueequegTheater> Let reggie throw his bombs
[2:34:58] <%IronOhki> \o/ praise that sun
[2:35:00] <zashrin777> can you damage them while theyre getting up? I forget.
[2:35:01] <%Artoo__The_Me> Yeah this vs drake farm. Each skeleton gives 50, big ones give 500 takes about 2-3 minutes and risk of death. Drake gives you 555 per climb and way faster
[2:35:03] <pixel_river> big birb
[2:35:04] <zzNamttamzz> All for a shitty spell NotLikeThis
[2:35:07] <+Jaromero435> I'm waiting for the item thing to be brought into a dokapon salt argument
[2:35:09] <Treasure_Vault> I don't think that was a farming spot.
[2:35:10] <velgaduere> @shinichizio he just wanted a couple
[2:35:11] <+cubbywolf> firebomb saga
[2:35:13] <Scorchfield> this is actually a rather bad farming spot but whatever
[2:35:15] <+cubbywolf> firebomb arc was just filler
[2:35:16] <%IronOhki> Situational
[2:35:16] <JetpackMcQuack> you don't know
[2:35:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie wants a utility belt Kappa
[2:35:21] <%LastHazzerd> he likes his utility belt
[2:35:23] <%Rafraud> But you still have the items
[2:35:23] <TenorSounds> The run to and back from drake takes time tho
[2:35:27] <Crowroost> All for a big brain Sorcery he'll use like twice, probably.
[2:35:27] <%Rafraud> You didn't lose them
[2:35:29] <andre11dr> The Drake bride would've been way faster but Woolie gonna Woolie
[2:35:31] <lotharrio> Elixir Banking...
[2:35:34] <velgaduere> he was only after like a couple thousand souls y'all, sheesh

[2:35:53] <%CateHecate> progress: never
[2:36:01] <%Rafraud> And nothing was learned ever
[2:36:06] <@Solidus_113> now to never use the spell LUL
[2:36:06] <%X2Eliah> And now to never ever use it
[2:36:12] <%IronOhki> Every player new to Dark Souls: "I want to play my way." Dark Souls: "That's cute."
[2:36:13] <+robertoszek> does he have the stats for this spell?
[2:36:13] <+Jaromero435> We did it
[2:36:14] <%CateHecate> set griggs on fire, please
[2:36:14] <LunarRemix> Can't for it do piss poor damage because of his low int
[2:36:16] <%Lion_kun> Wait till Reg gets to crystal soul spear.
[2:36:26] <%ZweihanderSteve> dang cool boar helmet
[2:36:38] <%Rafraud> He'll probs use great arrow tbh
[2:36:47] <andre11dr> Even tho we farmed, i feel like we achieved nothing somehow LUL
[2:36:49] <%IronOhki> @ZweihanderSteve Lucky early drop.
[2:36:50] <%Rafraud> Bets on him testing it here and hitting an npc?
[2:36:52] <Crowroost> Swing twice, enigma, swing twice.
[2:36:59] <%xjn_> OK DAD
[2:37:06] <%ZweihanderSteve> @ironohki I guess that explains I didn't know it existed LUL
[2:37:07] <+heros_lucatero> scjLaugh
[2:37:10] <%IronOhki> @xjn_ Sidecar seat be like that.
[2:37:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @IronOhki and then you're on run 26 like "sword handle +10 and smough helmet ONLY"
[2:37:11] <+robertoszek> @Rafraud yooo we need a poll
[2:37:12] <nxflre> whaat haappeened at Darkroot?
[2:37:13] <%vVAstrAVv> woolie beandadding too hard
[2:37:17] <0cash> let reggie die, he'll get used to not accidentally pressing down
[2:37:19] <jumpyhugs> Bloodborne's first alley teaches this same lesson
[2:37:22] <royb2> check out murakumo
[2:37:22] <%X2Eliah> Bean Woolie?
[2:37:32] <%IronOhki> @IronOhki Okay yes, also that.
[2:37:38] <KumaTorey> Murakumo pattyDitto
[2:37:39] <Johannen> Murakumo Rare drop
[2:37:40] <andre11dr> What is Woolie even doing now LUL
[2:37:44] <%IronOhki> @IronOhki Ymfah's entire career.
[2:37:49] <%xjn_> Reggie sure missed the winning goal
[2:37:52] <@Solidus_113> Murakumo fucks. it's so cool
[2:37:53] <+Jiggisnipe> stamina management is the essence of Dark Souls
[2:37:55] <Crowroost> Bean Woolie: "Kite strings, more like apron strings"
[2:38:05] <%Ensign_Epic> @IronOhki kill every boss possible before Tauros runs
[2:38:08] <%Artoo__The_Me> Murakumo has all the friends
[2:38:13] <Johannen> Folded THousands Times
[2:38:14] <oda_flobunaga> Inu Yasha
[2:38:15] <andre11dr> Murakumo is awesome
[2:38:17] <+Jaromero435> C U R V E D Sword
[2:38:18] <%X2Eliah> It's a SUPERKATANA
[2:38:22] <JetpackMcQuack> sekiro land
[2:38:27] <agustorm123> Are you gonna play redacted woolie?
[2:38:29] <%Ensign_Epic> Murakumo is one of the best weapons in the SERIES
[2:38:29] <%Juriasu> Murakumo is sick in every game
[2:38:33] <glass_marcus> Req Str, Scales with Dex
[2:38:36] <zashrin777> Woolie has a point though, groups need to be carefully finessed
[2:38:40] <+cubbywolf> i dont think ive ever seen murakumo in ds1
[2:38:41] <MikeyxStyles> Bean Woolie won't let Reggie learn on his own and play his way 🤷🏽 would "take too much time" gotta get on to new games smh
[2:38:42] <%dreadedcthulhu> BIG NUMBER dex weapon
[2:38:42] <JetpackMcQuack> or japan
[2:38:48] <%IronOhki> @IronOhki I've been playing around with speed runs, trying to kill as many bosses as I can in 4 hours. Made it to but not past O&S in a hurry. I love this game.
[2:38:50] <KumaTorey> kumato1Beard  simItar
[2:38:50] <%Ensign_Epic> Not just this game, but the entire Souls series, is the Murakumo an amazing weapon
[2:38:50] <+Shishi1205> yooo murakumo???
[2:38:51] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> I think Reggie should keep the full item loadout if he wants to. He said he wants to learn to not accidentally press it, so why not?
[2:39:01] <+cubbywolf> that swords swinging you
[2:39:08] <+pupil31> Go back to the gym
[2:39:13] <%dreadedcthulhu> u need 19 str to 2h it?
[2:39:13] <%Artoo__The_Me> Murakumo banged the cheer captain and the lead quarterback at the same time
[2:39:14] <jumpyhugs> GG no Re...equip
[2:39:16] <%jepupu> Did reggie ever try to 2-hand the halberd?
[2:39:17] <NumbF4ke> 2 more levels on str
[2:39:21] <QueequegTheater> I think he can try out the Zwei now
[2:39:21] <BurdRightsActivist> Playmore with the Claymore
[2:39:21] <brunoberserk> wait the skeletons drops murakumo ? i dont know that
[2:39:22] <%vVAstrAVv> wimpy wimpy wimpy
[2:39:30] <andre11dr> While the Murakumo is cool, i kinda the Cartus Great curved better, you get the cool flipping
[2:39:38] <+Jiggisnipe> he needs to learn to manage his stamina, that's literally the game
[2:39:42] <@Solidus_113> now, darkroot basin, now londo or blighttown?
[2:39:42] <+Shishi1205> the murakumo is a giant skeleton drop right?
[2:39:43] <Treasure_Vault> Nah, that's basic video game threat management
[2:39:45] <+cubbywolf> if woolie backseats reggie we can backseat woolie right?
[2:39:49] <+cdrom321> It's just talking strategy.
[2:39:51] <Treasure_Vault> kill the mooks before they mook you
[2:39:51] <sendart> test out the spell reggie
[2:39:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> or...the R O C K
[2:39:57] <ronin19xx> Yeah chat was being weird about it Woolz
[2:40:01] <+pectusumbra> Yeah try out your new toy reggarth!
[2:40:03] <Crowroost> All the bother for H Soul Arrow, INT is at what number?
[2:40:05] <BurdRightsActivist> @cubbywolf then who backseats us?
[2:40:12] <zashrin777> Chat being chat
[2:40:19] <+patriotrenegade> 16 INT, bare minimum
[2:40:27] <+cubbywolf> thats the trick, we are always backseating each other
[2:40:27] <brunoberserk> the grass crest shield can help with reggies stamina problems
[2:40:27] <%Ensign_Epic> @IronOhki Mentioned earlier, was doing SL10+5 until I realized I had fucked up leveling a unique weapon. Before that I got all the way to beating 4Kings; just moved that profile up to SL25+10 & will be cloning it off for multiple invaders at multiple SLs
[2:40:30] <Awesome_Leaf> PIG HEAD PogChamp
[2:40:34] <+cubbywolf> Elevator musac
[2:40:37] <andre11dr> Watch him not even use the it
[2:40:38] <+cubbywolf> doo doo da dee doo
[2:40:47] <oda_flobunaga> Nah
[2:40:48] <BurdRightsActivist> Kappa maybe.
[2:40:49] <LunarRemix> It will not
[2:40:53] <+Jiggisnipe> oh he's going Asylum
[2:40:55] <+cubbywolf> lets go

[2:41:02] <QueequegTheater> Can he even cast it
[2:41:05] <%vVAstrAVv> dont underestimate sorcery lol
[2:41:15] <Crowroost> Again, predicting the Heavy Soul Arrow use will stay at single digits for most of the run
[2:41:22] <%Ensign_Epic> Snuggly drops prolly
[2:41:22] <+cubbywolf> E G G
[2:41:31] <%Ensign_Epic> It would be suicide at this point to try Stray Demon
[2:41:34] <FibroidWorm39> hey woolie and reggie!
[2:41:36] <Crowroost> Egg Sack Wutface
[2:41:38] <oda_flobunaga> Stray is Magic resistant if I do recall
[2:41:44] <%dreadedcthulhu> nah he's on level for stray demon
[2:41:45] <zashrin777> we goin back to the thiccness
[2:41:46] <MikeyxStyles> fun times are about to be had
[2:41:53] <MikeyxStyles> potentially

[2:42:01] <+cubbywolf> use the power of the st ick
[2:42:02] <+pupil31> POP
[2:42:06] <+cdrom321> @oda_flobunaga Well, he's certainly magical.
[2:42:06] <mikesapartment> mama MIBA
[2:42:10] <+TheFrancix> BOOF
[2:42:12] <%robosqueeb> BAM
[2:42:13] <NumbF4ke> Stray demon is pretty doable, if he has bleed weapon
[2:42:14] <+cubbywolf> better than an arrow
[2:42:15] <andre11dr> Wow ,that grinding was so worth Kappa
[2:42:16] <sendart> pump dat int and dex
[2:42:20] <Crowroost> Toy ain't gonna scale if he stays at barely-legal INT
[2:42:22] <%Artoo__The_Me> Tastes good tho
[2:42:30] <SixthShinx> It seems to cook about as long as fireball
[2:42:31] <%Rafraud> SPELL SOULS
[2:42:34] <%Charronia> Worth the eternity of startup esaGood
[2:42:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:42:36] <%vVAstrAVv> its a rifle not a pistol
[2:42:37] <%robosqueeb> gotta simmer up them heavy souls
[2:42:38] <zashrin777> quite the windup on that swing, but its not a bad swing
[2:42:40] <AbnormalVoid> SACK
[2:42:40] <SixthShinx> Or I guess I'm wrong
[2:42:43] <+cubbywolf> picklepee
[2:42:48] <+cubbywolf> rump a pum pum
[2:42:49] <jumpyhugs> SACK
[2:42:50] <+Dakuu75> love that voice
[2:42:51] <Crowroost> Next is the grind for Grigg's Bellowing Dragoncrest
[2:42:52] <%thedankestmeeme> is that a girl actor?
[2:43:00] <%robosqueeb> the cast is a big commit
[2:43:06] <Deasmeister> Sniper not pistol
[2:43:08] <@Solidus_113> did they already give sunlight medal and dung pie?
[2:43:09] <+cdrom321> Plague went on a tangent yesterday about how lame casting is in all souls games.
[2:43:14] <nxflre> wheere they get veermifuge from?
[2:43:22] <+Shishi1205> not the medal
[2:43:23] <subjectg> snakes in darkroot
[2:43:23] <JetpackMcQuack> now resign the EULA
[2:43:24] <catasteroid0> in b4 egghead
[2:43:26] <%robosqueeb> I think elden ring is gonna make casting fun
[2:43:30] <+TheFrancix> nice
[2:43:30] <%Artoo__The_Me> Plague is wrong
[2:43:36] <+cdrom321> @nxflre Tree guarded by snake.
[2:43:38] <BurdRightsActivist> @cdrom321 I am going to go on a tangent today about how lame Plague is in all casting games
[2:43:43] <%robosqueeb> more fun*
[2:43:46] <+Shishi1205> sunlight medal too @woolieversus
[2:43:46] <+twohitgood> you know what always happens to me here? i accidentally hit circle too many times and die.
[2:43:47] <AbnormalVoid> D G H
[2:43:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> goodbye sack-chan
[2:43:52] <subjectg> ds2 made spellcasters pretty damn cool for pvp
[2:43:53] <nxflre> @cdrom321 aah right
[2:43:53] <linSP> sacced
[2:43:55] <Johannen> I member that you also can drop all the moss items for some upgrade materials
[2:44:04] <AbnormalVoid> Kreygasm
[2:44:08] <oda_flobunaga> Casting Iron Flesh in the face of a mob is a fricking amazing feeling
[2:44:11] <+pupil31> BIG THING
[2:44:12] <lotharrio> Well that's a good one.
[2:44:13] <+cubbywolf> nice but I sleep on that
[2:44:13] <zashrin777> doooope
[2:44:14] <jumpyhugs> lol let's go get a slab
[2:44:15] <+pectusumbra> yo, you can just get that!
[2:44:16] <Crowroost> I'd argue tthat at DS3 the castings became cooler with stuff like Flash Sword, a trend I hope Elden Ring will continue (Player version of arrow rain? yissss.)
[2:44:18] <+cubbywolf> penis envy hammer
[2:44:18] <Estuko> make sure when you hold the dragon scale in your hand to say "I wish, I wish, with all my heart, to fly with dragons in a land apart"
[2:44:23] <+cdrom321> @nxflre It was from the snake itself. The tree had the toothpick.
[2:44:23] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp BOP
[2:44:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> isn't that DS2 too?
[2:44:27] <subjectg> Don’t backstep off the cliff!
[2:44:29] <%IronOhki> That's what you get. You get my axe of capitalism in your face.
[2:44:31] <andre11dr> I forgot about that bullshit
[2:44:33] <AbnormalVoid> BIG BOP
[2:44:45] <+cdrom321> @estuko I love you.
[2:44:47] <%robosqueeb> BONK
[2:44:50] <+Dakuu75> OMEGA-bonk
[2:44:52] <andre11dr> Isn't that the Asylum Demon weapon
[2:44:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Paige's weapon for awhile
[2:44:59] <Crowroost> Try beating to a pulp
[2:45:00] <%Ensign_Epic> It is indeed
[2:45:01] <Estuko> @cdrom321 haha
[2:45:03] <glass_marcus> This game is begging reggie to pump strength
[2:45:11] <AbnormalVoid> VERY worth it
[2:45:12] <+pectusumbra> but it scales strong
[2:45:15] <%dreadedcthulhu> good scaling tho
[2:45:17] <KyberNasse> Big Clobba
[2:45:21] <Scorchfield> pretty easy to get if you start with black fire bombs
[2:45:21] <+pectusumbra> by the time you have the str for it it hits HARD
[2:45:23] <+twohitgood> it's base level 138. you gotta upgrade.
[2:45:24] <catasteroid0> @Estuko you just sent me back to my childhood
[2:45:24] <royb2> Massive scaling
[2:45:25] <%dreadedcthulhu> 32 str to 2 hand
[2:45:32] <+NiktenKing> BIG B FOR BIG BOY SCALING
[2:45:35] <+askalta> dark souls 1 has the worst str weapons by a mile but everyone thinks they are good because of meme videos from 2012
[2:45:35] <Hegelundra> black fire bomb starting gift is exactly enough to beat him on the first try
[2:45:47] <AbnormalVoid> 31 str
[2:45:56] <Crowroost> Main damage stats beyond 40 is such an damn investmentt
[2:45:58] <AbnormalVoid> 31+15 = 46
[2:46:01] <oda_flobunaga> Whunk
[2:46:02] <jumpyhugs> CHOMK
[2:46:09] <%IronOhki> Ho-Ly
[2:46:15] <+cdrom321> @burdrightsactivist I'm going to go on a tangent tomorrow about how lame you are at plague games.
[2:46:20] <AbnormalVoid> Retuuuurn the slaaaaab
[2:46:29] <Crowroost> *Darkstalkers 3 announcer* MIRACLE
[2:46:30] <oda_flobunaga> Blunk, Grunk, Runk
[2:46:41] <Johannen> Have they already exchanged the Moss items?
[2:46:43] <andre11dr> It fine ,but Demon Grateaxe is just superior
[2:46:43] <%Ensign_Epic> @glass_marcus This game's STR requirements are much higher than DEX. Talking 39/50 STR vs 25 DEX as the maximum stat requirements
[2:46:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Don't waste em
[2:46:52] <BurdRightsActivist> He'
[2:47:02] <BurdRightsActivist> He's gonna use that scale on the drake sword, is he?

[2:47:35] <%thedankestmeeme> YUM DESERT
[2:47:36] <AbnormalVoid> Fun Fact: Asylum Demon is weak to bleed
[2:47:42] <%IronOhki> They detected bitch in his heart.
[2:47:43] <+theoldone001> Says Woolie the traitor, who would sacrifice humanity for sick robot legs
[2:47:45] <+NiktenKing> Please tell me you are gonna show him THAT
[2:47:46] <%CateHecate> how can you eat your pudding if you dont eat your meat

[2:48:04] <%IronOhki> @theoldone001 Pat: Would you stab me right now for a Jetpack? Woolie: How many times?
[2:48:11] <Parapattern> I swear to god I lose it every time I even think about Plague's DS video

[2:49:01] <JetpackMcQuack> ya like tools?
[2:49:01] <KeiganOfAstora> It's almost like it's not worth it LUL
[2:49:02] <+patriotrenegade> HES FOR REAL
[2:49:03] <%Ensign_Epic> This character is gonna have a VERY interesting stat spread
[2:49:03] <Equirah> don't back up when you break the guard
[2:49:05] <%IronOhki> just timing.
[2:49:07] <%IronOhki> You're getting it.
[2:49:10] <%Deekman> stairs
[2:49:11] <andre11dr> DAMN that grinding was so worth Kappa
[2:49:17] <%Rafraud> Late
[2:49:18] <%xjn_> It's tricky to parry in stairs
[2:49:22] <zashrin777> mind the stairs, slanted ground fucks up parries and ripostes
[2:49:26] <jumpyhugs> a few frames off
[2:49:29] <+patriotrenegade> again, your shield isnt the best for parrying
[2:49:32] <%IronOhki> You're getting it. Keep trying.
[2:49:35] <JetpackMcQuack> hit the button better
[2:49:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:49:38] <subjectg> no one ever extolls the virtues of parrying the second hit
[2:49:40] <%dreadedcthulhu> buffering the riposte is gonna get him killed lol
[2:49:45] <%Ensign_Epic> Do setup parries work as well in DS1 vs DS3?
[2:49:48] <%IronOhki> Camera Souls
[2:49:50] <KeiganOfAstora> Everything is so damn slow
[2:49:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can also backstab him, though it may be hard in the corridor
[2:50:02] <%Rafraud> Back stab?
[2:50:09] <%IronOhki> BOOM.
[2:50:11] <+Jiggisnipe> nice
[2:50:14] <%IronOhki> You are.
[2:50:16] <Johannen> You...did it
[2:50:26] <%IronOhki> Do not fear the parry. It's tricky but you will get it.

[2:53:48] <KeiganOfAstora> DUNE
[2:53:51] <subjectg> one of the best shields in the game
[2:53:53] <andre11dr> That shield is sick
[2:53:57] <+RemedyofRevenge> thats a great shield for a later point in the game
[2:54:01] <+alphonseisbest> hey Chat these vods up on Youtube?
[2:54:05] <%Artoo__The_Me> @abnormalvoid That was a good one LUL
[2:54:06] <Darren716> Crest and Dragon Crest are the only shields you ever need
[2:54:08] <+NiktenKing> 100 and 80
[2:54:12] <+pectusumbra> better weight
[2:54:12] <%Rafraud> He's been agro'd since the first time he returned here, reggie just kept dodging him
[2:54:13] <%Ensign_Epic> May be worth using for this fight
[2:54:14] <+Rasheedt> @alphonseisbest yes
[2:54:15] <AbnormalVoid> Kappa
[2:54:18] <Crowroost> "If the shield says 'Crest', it is the best."
[2:54:18] <%marrowslurp> Look at that utility tho
[2:54:21] <stormhawk9891> Best shield
[2:54:25] <Cymen90> lol 80% magic resist and Reggie is like "meh. decent"
[2:54:28] <scarman125> good magic he says
[2:54:35] <%CateHecate> BY LIKE 5
[2:54:35] <QueequegTheater> Literally the only ones better are huge greatshields
[2:54:46] <+mechslayer71> and it just looks sick
[2:54:47] <subjectg> Crest shield and grass crest are the only shields you’ll ever need
[2:54:47] <%IronOhki> Situational Equip
[2:54:48] <velgaduere> butterflies HATE HIM
[2:54:50] <%thedankestmeeme> isn't it great how all the assholes who are selfish and think about themselves and trick others live and the people who help you and the hero's BEFORE you become your enemies sadge
[2:54:52] <+Grayhammatter> only greatshields are gonna be better
[2:54:52] <+cubbywolf> yeah but that lightning dmg
[2:54:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that Crest Shield gonna be REAL good later in the game
[2:55:01] <@Solidus_113> Havel is pretty close
[2:55:07] <KeiganOfAstora> Havel is close
[2:55:09] <HappyHorrorShow> use crest for healthy teeth
[2:55:10] <oda_flobunaga> But... Havel the Rock Gwinson
[2:55:10] <KeiganOfAstora> Black Knight is close
[2:55:14] <+cubbywolf> back down
[2:55:17] <scarman125> Havel's is pretty fucking close
[2:55:22] <+RemedyofRevenge> Stability and poise won't function the same
[2:55:26] <Johannen> How much is artorias?
[2:55:27] <andre11dr> That's the shield that rocket on first playthrough, i just think it looks really cool
[2:55:28] <+megaman_sentinel> black knight
[2:55:32] <+askalta> at the end of the day Reggie will know its Hester shield 🛡
[2:55:33] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Reminder that Wolf Ring/Poise have no effect on stability.
[2:55:35] <+Shishi1205> Is the murakumo a 2% drop too? Are the % correct?
[2:55:36] <@Solidus_113> havel is 100/90/80/80
[2:55:41] <KeiganOfAstora> Baldur is good except it's heavy
[2:55:42] <+cubbywolf> is stability how much stamina a block takes then?
[2:55:43] <Crowroost> Balder is (upgraded) a beast of stability for its weight class.
[2:55:55] <andre11dr> The crest shield was in DS3 right?
[2:55:59] <Crowroost> ye

[2:57:36] <+cubbywolf> thats a death everyone has
[2:57:36] <%IronOhki> Shake it off.
[2:57:39] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 There was a reason I seethed, lol. Murakumo you can force to drop in Tomb of Giants over by Large Divine Ember (even right by the bonfire for an easy run), but Catchpole has the wandering Titanite Demons, or the respawning one ONLY
[2:57:43] <+Shishi1205> 2nd try butterfly is good
[2:57:45] <Johannen> You did some great rolls
[2:57:49] <BurdRightsActivist> @subjectg It's not even that, it's if he's playing on PC monkaS
[2:57:49] <andre11dr> @burdrightsactivist If your talking about Soul Memory, yes that will be a pain to invade Reggie
[2:57:59] <+cubbywolf> probably shoulda done it before agro
[2:58:05] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 life is not fair
[2:58:09] <+cubbywolf> wow hes tough
[2:58:27] <%LastHazzerd> Magic is fun, ya gotta be smart tho

[2:58:56] <+alphonseisbest> F
[2:58:56] <+cubbywolf> theres the multiple strikes LUL
[2:58:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just bait him to an open area
[2:59:01] <sirrice77> Does the crest shield increase stability with upgrades? If so then maybe that should be done
[2:59:08] <%Rafraud> Maybe if he sees a video of the timing on it?
[2:59:12] <Awesome_Leaf> I always just block the first swing and parry the second
[2:59:18] <+cubbywolf> why would he need a video if he can just do it
[2:59:18] <%Rafraud> Ah fair
[2:59:21] <subjectg> @burdrightsactivist sadly, those boss invasions were pretty cool
[2:59:25] <Crowroost> @LastHazzerd that's like both a stat tip and tactical advice. nice 1
[2:59:29] <%Ensign_Epic> I think I remember someone having a Malcolm Reynolds sighting recently, but ye most Souls hackers have sorta calmed down

[3:06:40] <zashrin777> Usually for this fight i just strip off all armor to maximize speed instead
[3:06:41] <SoaringTrumpet> at least this is an insanely short run from the bonfire
[3:06:43] <%dreadedcthulhu> Hella doable but long

[3:09:58] <BurdRightsActivist> where gamble?
[3:09:58] <+beansoup> this fight without lock is way easier
[3:09:59] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Unlocking is good in this fight though
[3:10:04] <VincentGraves> locks are actually bad IMO in this fight
[3:10:04] <Dopamien> ive never locked on in ds1
[3:10:13] <+Shishi1205> @beansoup for experienced players maybe

[3:13:56] <Johannen> @cdrom321 Remaster suposedly added it, multiple people and forums mentioned it
[3:14:05] <user_naim> Where are your burst baits Reg?
[3:14:05] <+beansoup> he's got it
[3:14:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Wyo maybe?

[3:14:18] <%dreadedcthulhu> time for the loops Pog
[3:14:21] <OblivionSword1> oh word we're fighting stray ?
[3:14:24] <Crowroost> way 2 jinx it
[3:14:25] <Deko_> yeyeye
[3:14:28] <OldManDeckardCain> CHRIS PRATT AS PUCCI?!
[3:14:34] <penitentpendant> Smug Detected, Adjusting AI
[3:14:35] <pixel_river> i remember this one being tough
[3:14:40] <Crowroost> Chris Prucci
[3:14:41] <scarman125> once you figure out that behind the tail is a safe space this boss is a cake walk
[3:14:43] <subjectg> stray is odd because you want to roll early for his attacks, contrary to every other boss in the game
[3:14:43] <AbnormalVoid> it's so big Kreygasm
[3:14:47] <+beansoup> very admirable fighting stray this early tbh
[3:14:50] <Gelphaze> Thats what she said.
[3:14:50] <andre11dr> I don't even know who Kira is ,was she 2B or something?
[3:14:56] <OblivionSword1> chat which zones has Reggie visit today ?
[3:14:56] <%Rafraud> He's got the pattern
[3:14:59] <AbnormalVoid> he's really not intended until later, all things considered lol
[3:15:00] <%Rafraud> He jus has to do it perfect
[3:15:06] <+Bonessssss> go for it reggie!
[3:15:06] <%Lion_kun> Stickto his ass and strafe
[3:15:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @OblivionSword1 darkroot garden
[3:15:09] <%Rafraud> He can do it if he wants
[3:15:10] <Johannen> Very beatable before blight? Wut
[3:15:11] <+pectusumbra> how much damage does the heavy soul arrow do?
[3:15:12] <agustorm123> He is big unga with magic spells
[3:15:18] <QueequegTheater> Or he uses the uchi, but there's no reason for him to think of that
[3:15:19] <NumbF4ke> Cant retreat that far, stray is more dangerous whe far away
[3:15:25] <Treasure_Vault> Nice jump?
[3:15:32] <subjectg> Kira buckland is just a very prolific va, used to do quite a lot of newgrounds stuff too
[3:15:33] <+cdrom321> @johannen I thought I would've noticed when I played it recently.
[3:15:35] <+Shishi1205> chat how many tries for havel when he mets rockboi?
[3:15:37] <OblivionSword1> @OblivionSword1 ok cool thanks
[3:15:41] <VincentGraves> i have beaten this dude before blight town, just gotta have a good weapon
[3:15:41] <Omentus> stray demon and fire demon are the most bs bosses
[3:15:51] <%Ensign_Epic> He's gotten the hitboxes down, nice
[3:15:52] <bobxmaker> he's doing it peter!
[3:15:53] <andre11dr> Nah ,he can totally do this with the Claymore
[3:15:59] <%Rafraud> Slow and steady reggie
[3:16:01] <QueequegTheater> Or 4 swings lmao
[3:16:01] <LunarRemix> Stray is fine but Fire has annoying AI
[3:16:03] <AbnormalVoid> could always upgrade drake sword
[3:16:04] <%Rafraud> There's no timer
[3:16:06] <%Rafraud> Lame him out
[3:16:09] <%trisarahtopsssss> capra demon has to be the one that killed me most
[3:16:10] <Klefth> Combustion probably does way more than the claymore
[3:16:11] <%Deekman> is fire even worth it? Aren't demons resistant to fire?
[3:16:12] <Reveresao> kindle bonfire? @WoolieVersus
[3:16:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> not to be a party pooper, but I'm pretty sure this is a bit early for the stray demon, right?
[3:16:14] <Omentus> that aoe is so dumb
[3:16:18] <slix3431> REGGIE IS GOIN TOO HARD
[3:16:19] <QueequegTheater> @LunarRemix Fire is literally a palette swap of stray
[3:16:20] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:16:22] <jetjagger222> IIRC blocking the shockwavfe works in an emergency
[3:16:25] <slix3431> This is not the time to fight him
[3:16:29] <penitentpendant> Showed the hollow your stick
[3:16:29] <user_naim> Essence of Bean
[3:16:36] <subjectg> You have to roll into him to dodge that far aoe
[3:16:37] <%dreadedcthulhu> looping him is hella valid as a strat
[3:16:39] <%Rafoki> if only there was a shield that blocks magic...
[3:16:40] <JetpackMcQuack> you got it
[3:16:49] <%CateHecate> you also really dont have to do this this early
[3:16:52] <+Shishi1205> grass shield would be good here
[3:16:53] <counterfeitgimmicks> Reggie needs a stronger wep :(
[3:16:56] <%xjn_> xjn_ is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel!

[3:16:58] <andre11dr> This is totally fine, Stray i known to be an asshole, you're technically supposed to do this before Sens
[3:17:01] <MeImoth> my strat for him is to grab whatever Bleed weapon I have and just get trough his large HP pool with bleed procs
[3:17:01] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[3:17:07] <agustorm123> Dodged
[3:17:07] <BurdRightsActivist> Dodged Kappa
[3:17:08] <Lazywabbit> noice
[3:17:09] <+Shishi1205> we dont even see it lmao
[3:17:10] <scarman125> Backing too far away from Stray is a death sentence,
[3:17:12] <@Solidus_113> roast the cellulite
[3:17:16] <Lazywabbit> but when will I get gifted no clue lol
[3:17:18] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus demon's are made from flame so they're all resistant to fire iirc
[3:17:32] <IamGreven> i remember this boss being easy, probably because i used the uchi
[3:17:39] <%dreadedcthulhu> u can in fact hit his tail
[3:17:44] <Klefth> Mann, he needs to take advantage of those jumps
[3:17:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:17:45] <%Ensign_Epic> This feels like a full download already
[3:17:47] <+SilverDevilfish> He's super weak to bleed
[3:17:48] <+pupil31> Fuck him up Reggie
[3:17:51] <BurdRightsActivist> @IamGreven Bleed's so fuckin good in ds1
[3:17:53] <%Rafraud> Pretend you're playing against a zoner and you got this fight down
[3:17:56] <+Shishi1205> good dmg
[3:17:59] <KaiserMario> The AoE is so much easier to see in this version too
[3:18:03] <+pectusumbra> did he test any magic on stray?
[3:18:04] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Awesome camera control
[3:18:05] <%marrowslurp> Slow and steady
[3:18:06] <BurdRightsActivist> @IamGreven Reinforced club is THE SHIT
[3:18:08] <Ilkim61> could use the strong attack
[3:18:11] <oda_flobunaga> Lame it out Lame it out never throw it away
[3:18:11] <+pupil31> OOF

[3:18:16] <Visorak6> ass
[3:18:16] <user_naim> That’s not a lot of damage per swing
[3:18:17] <counterfeitgimmicks> F
[3:18:18] <QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:18:19] <+Grayhammatter> squashed
[3:18:19] <scarman125> flattened
[3:18:21] <RabbitOTM> ass too strong
[3:18:21] <+Shishi1205> imagine if souls worked like mario and touching enemies dmged you
[3:18:22] <%Ensign_Epic> Never swing while he's mid-air
[3:18:22] <%Rafraud> Tap and out
[3:18:22] <0cash> PEACH'D
[3:18:25] <penitentpendant> +1 Fetish Damage
[3:18:26] <BurdRightsActivist> dick flattened
[3:18:27] <%Rafoki> those deaths happen
[3:18:27] <Laironx3> Has Reg tried to beat large bosses without lock-on? It makes a big difference
[3:18:28] <SoaringTrumpet> welcome to dark souls
[3:18:29] <Equirah> Pole time for safety?
[3:18:31] <%Ensign_Epic> Swinging while the demon is midair is a death sentence
[3:18:33] <NumbF4ke> Very doable
[3:18:37] <KaiserMario> Flying PEACH!
[3:18:43] <+askalta> black knight weapons do extra damage to demons
[3:18:45] <%Ensign_Epic> especially for slower weapons
[3:18:46] <andre11dr> Damn ,Reggarth just ate some ass
[3:18:47] <+Shishi1205> Im pretty sure lock on fucked reggie there
[3:18:48] <Crowroost> wonder how long this'll go on until we realize the damage is dick
[3:18:52] <%Lion_kun> can you cancel with a roll?
[3:18:53] <bobxmaker> bleed yeah, it's great for big slow bosses.
[3:18:53] <Equirah> also just unequip the shield
[3:18:57] <+RemedyofRevenge> I mean, this is a tough fight for the DPS reggie's equipment can do right now
[3:18:59] <JetpackMcQuack> so badass
[3:19:14] <%xjn_> Reggie believe in me who believes in you, this is the one
[3:19:16] <Equirah> @RemedyofRevenge he has better, he's just not using it
[3:19:28] <slix3431> Pick a cheek
[3:19:31] <+RemedyofRevenge> @Equirah I know
[3:19:35] <+Grayhammatter> pick a cheek
[3:19:36] <RabbitOTM> armpit loyalty
[3:19:38] <%Ensign_Epic> What WL is he, +5?
[3:19:42] <%Rafraud> If he had 10 sips he'd probs last but I think he gets it
[3:19:57] <agustorm123> His doing so little damage
[3:19:59] <SarcFa> yeah he's +5 atm
[3:20:03] <AbnormalVoid> Greedy Frontal Attacks
[3:20:06] <0cash> should just get rid of some equip and get that fast roll. Would be more useful in this case
[3:20:14] <+Shishi1205> double cheeked up on a Tuesday afternoon
[3:20:19] <JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[3:20:24] <%Ensign_Epic> man if he kindled he'd have this
[3:20:27] <+Shishi1205> not in front reggie
[3:20:28] <bobxmaker> i agree it is gonna take a bit of time to chew through this hp with reggies current equipment, i tend to go here after b-town.
[3:20:36] <%Rafraud> He's also not supposed to be here yet its okay
[3:20:40] <+Shishi1205> always faceing his back
[3:20:43] <jumpyhugs> I love the strat where he locks on so he can run slower Kappa LUL
[3:20:48] <slix3431> Why is reggie doing Stray demon so early?
[3:20:51] <+pectusumbra> again, why not try his spells for damage?
[3:20:51] <%xjn_> Hey we got to that part of the song!
[3:20:57] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's the lock on doing it most times
[3:20:57] <QueequegTheater> Immediately swings at him stomach
[3:21:01] <Klefth> Actually, that's the best place to swing at. It baits the jump
[3:21:02] <oneimportantthing> JUST KINDLE
[3:21:03] <+patriotrenegade> Maybe try putting on magic resist geaR?
[3:21:05] <AbnormalVoid> locking on is dangerous, cause it's harder to run away
[3:21:22] <penitentpendant> Them brave double swings
[3:21:26] <KyberNasse> I love the clown music part of this boss theme
[3:21:26] <+Grayhammatter> the greed
[3:21:35] <anachronologist> Hes doing good tho
[3:21:36] <+Shishi1205> feeling good
[3:21:39] <+Jiggisnipe> awwww
[3:21:40] <bobxmaker> @pectusumbra he did test them and they didn't do much damage, well less than the sword in any case because he has low int and haven't upgraded his flame
[3:21:40] <huskarl_zap> doubled up dumpy
[3:21:41] <0cash> yeah, locking isnt great here but reggie is making it work
[3:21:41] <BurdRightsActivist> Je
[3:21:42] <ronin19xx> Downloaded?
[3:21:44] <ronin19xx> NVM
[3:21:45] <%Orbital_Zero> Did they change the blast radius in the remaster?  I feel like it was bigger in the OG version
[3:21:45] <AbnormalVoid> it's to the left
[3:21:46] <BurdRightsActivist> He's beginning to believe
[3:21:50] <%Lion_kun> if reggie kindles that bonfire, he can do this
[3:21:52] <AbnormalVoid> you wanna be to his right as much as possible
[3:21:52] <%xjn_> Progress!
[3:21:52] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie can do this, I believe
[3:21:52] <brunoberserk> if i not mistaken , stray is weak against bleeding , uchi can work against him
[3:21:55] <%Lion_kun> kindle that fire reg
[3:21:56] <anachronologist> Get some beter armor Reggington
[3:21:56] <%Juriasu> GET HIM REG
[3:21:56] <LunarRemix> You're doing it
[3:21:57] <%Rafraud> He's got it
[3:21:58] <+pupil31> Kindle that
[3:21:59] <subjectg> once you understand all of stray’s attacks he’s really easy. Long, but easy
[3:21:59] <SolidusA> hug that booty
[3:22:02] <+Shishi1205> @Orbital_Zero maybe? I dont think they changed a lot of things
[3:22:02] <royb2> Ye kindle
[3:22:04] <%Rafraud> He can do it in 5 tbh
[3:22:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the stomach folds may look attractive and succulent, but NAY! It's a trap to lure impressionable young men into its embrace!
[3:22:06] <QueequegTheater> @Orbital_Zero They changed the effect so it's more clear
[3:22:07] <%Lion_kun> having 5 extra sips will help
[3:22:10] <ronin19xx> Bro you can
[3:22:11] <agustorm123> Kindle
[3:22:11] <%xjn_> lobosHype lobosHype lobosHype
[3:22:12] <TheyCallMeVawn> Just dont be greedy
[3:22:12] <Equirah> use the uchi for bleed so that you have some damage at least
[3:22:13] <+pupil31> Do it
[3:22:14] <%Rafraud> But you have a shitload of humanity lol
[3:22:14] <woweeezoweee> oh man FUCK this boss they put a big boy with an AOE in a small tiny room lmao

[3:22:22] <+Grayhammatter> kindle dude
[3:22:30] <Klefth> Also, punish that jump attack
[3:22:31] <%Lion_kun> this is not a challenge mode, take every advantage you can get
[3:22:33] <KeiganOfAstora> Dont waste the humanity
[3:22:35] <%Ensign_Epic> You honestly should be kindling every bonfire you come across if at all possible
[3:22:35] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Reggie you can literally grind humanity in the depths off-stream
[3:22:39] <oneimportantthing> Dude kindle
[3:22:39] <%Orbital_Zero> @Orbital_Zero gotcha
[3:22:41] <%Deekman> nice
[3:22:42] <scarman125> why is he taking unnecessary damage from those hollows
[3:22:43] <%Lion_kun> you don't get extra stuff for doing it the hard way
[3:22:43] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> He's got loads to spare why not
[3:22:44] <%Rafraud> Its not a waste of humanity

[3:22:55] <JetpackMcQuack> reggie > demons
[3:22:56] <%Rafraud> Humanity isn't limited

[3:23:23] <%IronOhki> Oh we doing it.
[3:23:28] <%Orbital_Zero> Its gonna be a great feeling when he beats it!
[3:23:30] <SarcFa> @oda_flobunaga he can only kindle to 10 atm
[3:23:31] <pixel_river> monkaS
[3:23:33] <%Ensign_Epic> Honestly? Just Andre dupe the Humanities
[3:23:36] <KingDrPimp> I believe!
[3:23:36] <QueequegTheater> @IronOhki We, yes. Reggie? No.
[3:23:43] <+cdrom321> @oda_flobunaga He doesn't have the rite of kindling.
[3:23:43] <+Grayhammatter> i believe!
[3:23:45] <%Ensign_Epic> Or ask for someone to drop them
[3:23:48] <user_naim> It’s not like this game has Darklurker. We can pop some humanity
[3:23:49] <+Jiggisnipe> just don't get greedy on that one magic explosion attack
[3:23:49] <+xyxlzyzm> go reggie!
[3:23:49] <+Shishi1205> @Ensign_Epic is that remastered tech?
[3:23:53] <%Rafraud> Just kill rats for humanity guys its fine lol
[3:23:55] <oda_flobunaga> I know..... even still..
[3:23:57] <%Ensign_Epic> Farming in the Souls series is stupidly boring
[3:23:57] <%Deekman> watch him do this without taking 5 sips
[3:23:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Ok I gotta go. I'll watch the second half later. Time for Blighttown
[3:23:59] <+Shishi1205> nice unlock
[3:24:07] <subjectg> @keiganofastora you can also farm from the bab skellies in TotG
[3:24:15] <+RyTYoung> I feel like Woolie is becoming that dude Cave313 on YouTube, being the most G mentor around
[3:24:18] <QueequegTheater> I hope after he beats stray Woolie tells him about the bleed cheese
[3:24:20] <Treasure_Vault> Is Darklurker still top 3 coolest Dark Souls bosses?
[3:24:23] <ronin19xx> He bleeds like crazy btw
[3:24:27] <vnzuelandude> Reggie is here already dang
[3:24:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:24:27] <QueequegTheater> @Treasure_Vault yes
[3:24:29] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:24:38] <DrkJP520> If you cut off his butt cheeks you get a cool shield.
[3:24:40] <+Jiggisnipe> naaawwwww
[3:24:40] <gulthrax> just chop his butt, easy
[3:24:41] <brunoberserk> thats a dirt hitbox
[3:24:41] <%Lion_kun> too many strategies tripped him up, stick to a simple strat
[3:24:43] <Johannen> Good Idea
[3:24:49] <+Jiggisnipe> you had the strat, just be patient
[3:24:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:24:50] <subjectg> you really don’t want to be far away from this dude
[3:24:50] <Equirah> chnage your spells
[3:24:51] <%Lion_kun> this is the problem with hybrid builds
[3:24:52] <TheyCallMeVawn> Too much going on with pyromancy and sorceries
[3:24:53] <SoaringTrumpet> @DrkJP520 hahaha
[3:24:53] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> Totally viable
[3:24:53] <NumbF4ke> Not a bad idea
[3:24:54] <agustorm123> He needs a faster roll
[3:24:54] <+RyTYoung> @vnzuelandude yeah he is here just after fighting the moonlight butterfly
[3:24:55] <scarman125> staying at range with Stray is basically suicide
[3:24:56] <SarcFa> good idea, flubbed execution
[3:24:59] <Crowroost> bbl at this damage level it's going to take a quintillion years
[3:24:59] <+stantashev> Free enchant?
[3:25:01] <%xjn_> woolieGLORY
[3:25:09] <woweeezoweee> honestly the best strat fort his is just stick to his ass and then run the fuck away when he AOE's
[3:25:10] <+megaman_sentinel> always hit it fromthe back lol
[3:25:14] <%KellBeII> you can always come back here later.  this is a really tough fight that you can save until the end
[3:25:15] <+Shishi1205> unlock to run
[3:25:16] <AbnormalVoid> LOCK ON BAD
[3:25:18] <NumbF4ke> Just make sure to be on that ass
[3:25:20] <JetpackMcQuack> damn
[3:25:21] <+pupil31> BONK
[3:25:26] <+Grayhammatter> oof, bonked
[3:25:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pain
[3:25:32] <+patriotrenegade> gzsh
[3:25:33] <BigYanno> the thing about this boss is his moveset is small but all his aoe's make him super annoying to fight

[3:25:36] <theredfox930000> majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko
[3:25:39] <TheAmazingNick> Tuning in to see Reggie 2 handing without a shield. The one true, honest way to play dark souls
[3:25:43] <gulthrax> circle strafe dat booty bruh
[3:25:44] <andre11dr> Honestly Dark lurker is cool ,but his definitely not yop 3
[3:25:45] <%Juriasu> what you say?
[3:25:45] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> WE GET SIGNAL
[3:25:49] <%Ensign_Epic> @Ensign_Epic Yup, basically use prompt swapping to buy a single weapon with the weight of 999 of them, go to buy another but cancel out, and then use the normal quantity dupe prompt swap to drop a negative value. Dropping a negative value goes straight to your inventory
[3:25:56] <BigYanno> I've always found that locking on to this guy is the worst thing you can do
[3:25:56] <+RyTYoung> I don't like the buzzing noise when Reggie dies WutFace
[3:25:57] <Majinobama> 659 raiders from Majinobama have joined!

[3:27:13] <%Rafraud> What is happening
[3:27:13] <+Jiggisnipe> I feel like Reggie is complicating it, when he didn't have estus left, he had the strat
[3:27:16] <Gelphaze> Where here for you buddy.
[3:27:18] <sirrice77> @glass_marcus But he needs to get that SSS for the beat drop
[3:27:18] <DrkJP520> Gotta get that S-rank though

[3:28:16] <+askalta> let him try
[3:28:17] <+robertoszek> Woolie debating on how to address the raid without alienating the youtube audience is priceless
[3:28:18] <+Jiggisnipe> KISS
[3:28:21] <%Orbital_Zero> Don't feel too bad Reggie! I don't even want to think how many times it took me to beat it lol
[3:28:22] <Deko_> lame it out

[3:28:24] <SoaringTrumpet> 4Head just
[3:28:36] <%esoteric_simp> reggie must prove himself
[3:28:37] <VincentGraves> just let him do it and see what happens
[3:28:39] <glass_marcus> This is really making me want to see Reggie play dmc
[3:28:42] <slix3431> Good timing!
[3:28:46] <miucsa51> Style before Strats
[3:28:50] <+liquidzr0> ??????

[3:28:51] <+tempestzephyr> But it's cool, woolie
[3:28:52] <woweeezoweee> yeah woolies right, this boss fights room is way to slow to fuck with magic *IMO*
[3:28:53] <available_line> Not smarts enough for magic damage
[3:28:54] <+ArtemisCroc> woolie is right, why bother spell casting when it does less damage, is more dangerous and is slower than just using your sword?
[3:28:57] <+aBoner89> dont die 4Head
[3:28:59] <+Jiggisnipe> bonk
[3:29:01] <+Shishi1205> POISE
[3:29:01] <%Rafraud> He wants to use all his moves for this fight when he literally just needs to use one
[3:29:03] <+askalta> poise
[3:29:06] <+Shishi1205> WE POISE THORUGH
[3:29:10] <+Jiggisnipe> like xTekken

[3:29:15] <andre11dr> So yeah i still don't know why we grinded for that spell LUK
[3:29:15] <+Shishi1205> *through
[3:29:18] <agustorm123> Please don’t lock
[3:29:33] <Johannen> @andre11dr Cause Reggie wants magic
[3:29:36] <woweeezoweee> oh yeah just the optimal strat is lay it on then run away like the biggest of cowards
[3:29:37] <+RyTYoung> He got the spacing and timing PogChamp
[3:29:38] <%Rafraud> Perfect
[3:29:40] <+kewlmyc> Cake AOE
[3:29:41] <%Mushinronja> the spell would work fine, just have to pick shots
[3:29:43] <%Mushinronja> like when it jumps
[3:29:43] <%Rafraud> Just like that
[3:29:44] <+Shishi1205> nice sip

[3:37:42] <%Ensign_Epic> the madman
[3:37:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TOO EARLY
[3:37:45] <JetpackMcQuack> feast
[3:37:45] <Deko_> pump it up
[3:37:46] <MeImoth> way to soon
[3:37:47] <royb2> nah fuck the crest its optional anyway
[3:37:47] <%Ensign_Epic> he's suggesting doge
[3:37:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> He's not ready LUL
[3:37:48] <scarman125> TOO EARLY
[3:37:48] <woweeezoweee> he needs way more stamina imo
[3:37:49] <SoaringTrumpet> pump it up
[3:37:49] <%Rafraud> Fair enough
[3:37:49] <velgaduere> WAY to early
[3:37:49] <Dopamien> truffle oil doesnt do anything with taste, it just smells really good 😡 I still like it
[3:37:49] <%Ensign_Epic> this early
[3:37:50] <%Lion_kun> You never need to spend money to open that door.
[3:37:50] <Johannen> Too early
[3:37:50] <sendart> opens up a farm spot
[3:37:51] <+Grayhammatter> pump up that shit
[3:37:52] <+xyxlzyzm> u don't need no crest yet
[3:37:52] <justcallmebobplease> Unlocks the coolest area
[3:37:53] <Visorak6> Its way too early
[3:37:55] <%Rafraud> OPENS SOME COOL SHIT
[3:37:55] <+RyTYoung> I wouldn't bother rn

[3:38:02] <%Orbital_Zero> CREST TO FARM SOULS BAYBEEE
[3:38:04] <BigYanno> Crest is a key. It's a shortcut. not important.
[3:38:04] <andre11dr> Beating Blighttown will get him enough to get it
[3:38:04] <%vVAstrAVv> the crest is just a short ut
[3:38:05] <scarman125> IT'S WAY TOO EARLY
[3:38:05] <LordLoudmouth> Woolie, let the man enjoy life. Do not destroy his soul with the Crest yet.
[3:38:09] <%Rafraud> Faaaaaair
[3:38:11] <%IronOhki> Correct.
[3:38:12] <DuckfishPrime> Spend those souls
[3:38:16] <oda_flobunaga> That has an open backdoor
[3:38:16] <%IronOhki> Reggie chose wisely.
[3:38:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus There's also a way into that area without using the crest, so not crucial.
[3:38:18] <justcallmebobplease> Too early, for the guy that just got THAT boss down?
[3:38:18] <Deko_> we going to blighttown?
[3:38:22] <tony2tries> man i feel so good for reggie
[3:38:25] <%Lion_kun> I never spend money to open that door, I just take the long way near the waterfall.
[3:38:26] <+aBoner89> monkaS Artorias
[3:38:27] <BigYanno> I wonder if he has any souls to pop to get another level
[3:38:29] <+Shishi1205> way underleveled for
[3:38:30] <Kalinflip> neyh hey theres the highroller
[3:38:33] <Equirah> "little" LUL
[3:38:37] <Crowroost> Never INT, never again mark my words. Reggie is a toe-dipper
[3:38:38] <%vVAstrAVv> a LITTLE?
[3:38:39] <Treasure_Vault> Look at slab?
[3:38:42] <+swesterly> The door to the fastest safest farm spot in the game
[3:38:43] <%Bread_Assassin> Maybe we cool it on that door until post DLC.
[3:38:43] <woweeezoweee> nyeh theres the highroller
[3:38:43] <velgaduere> buyer's remorse
[3:38:46] <+Grayhammatter> look at the slab?
[3:38:49] <MeImoth> it is VERY slow
[3:38:49] <+Shishi1205> MAgic kinda sucky huh?
[3:38:52] <%vVAstrAVv> think about slab
[3:38:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:38:56] <andre11dr> I hope you enjoyed that W Reggie because where off to Fuvkonia LUL
[3:38:59] <LunarRemix> 16 is very low
[3:39:00] <BigYanno> what are the things that improve cast speed?
[3:39:02] <royb2> need more INT to pump up the damage
[3:39:02] <+askalta> 9 more int for the only spell that matters
[3:39:04] <+ArtemisCroc> int WILL pay off eventually
[3:39:05] <%Ensign_Epic> @Shishi1205 It's usually not in DS1
[3:39:06] <woweeezoweee> this aint dark souls 2 magic only gets you so far
[3:39:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @bread_assassin nah post dlc is WAY too late, the extra content ain't worth it
[3:39:14] <Treasure_Vault> Well all these points have done nothings, so better SPEND MORE
[3:39:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now is kinda time to start focusing i'd say
[3:39:19] <user_naim> So have we even touched Blightcon?
[3:39:20] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 yeah its bc its early
[3:39:22] <+ArtemisCroc> in NG, magic is totally good enough
[3:39:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> You can make the weapon scale with Int
[3:39:23] <%haitakaa> magic scaling weapon
[3:39:24] <sendart> needs more int or a better catalyst
[3:39:25] <+RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus there is always the rings the sorcerer in firelink sells that make spells stronger
[3:39:26] <MeImoth> sooo minimum investment for offensive magic to be worth it is 32 INT... well
[3:39:28] <Deko_> LUL
[3:39:28] <Crowroost> 16 is nowhere near "a mage"lmfao
[3:39:33] <+Rasheedt> @user_naim no
[3:39:33] <QueequegTheater> Reggie is approaching the point where he is going to have to commit to a build
[3:39:35] <diddlerriddler> Check out that gargoyle helm Reggie
[3:39:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Magic scaling weapon if he wants to go battlemage
[3:39:37] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[3:39:38] <user_naim> @rasheedt nice
[3:39:38] <+wynnewake> reggie is the least mage but I love his magely spirit
[3:39:39] <%vVAstrAVv> spells are pumped a lot by certain gear too
[3:39:41] <+Jiggisnipe> 16 int isn't a lot tbh
[3:39:43] <%IronOhki> Magic weapon is not bad.
[3:39:48] <TheyCallMeVawn> Reggies build is super fucked
[3:39:48] <Johannen> Yes
[3:39:49] <agustorm123> You really didn’t use your smarts there you only unga
[3:39:49] <BigYanno> I like his thinking
[3:39:50] <%haitakaa> just wait for homing soul arrow
[3:39:50] <andre11dr> Soul Arow is what he should be aiming for
[3:39:51] <AbnormalVoid> that's a fine level of int to stay at, if you just want the utility of sorcery, since you can use stuff like Cast Light and Fall Control
[3:39:53] <+Shishi1205> kinda but no
[3:39:53] <+swesterly> He isn’t really committed tbh
[3:39:56] <sendart> great soul is great
[3:39:59] <Crowroost> Reggo Soul Arrows aer slightly faster
[3:40:01] <+Shady_Zaku> 16 is like a second year at Hogwarts lmao doodScrub
[3:40:01] <+pectusumbra> regular soul arrow is fine. 30 casts and long long range
[3:40:03] <velgaduere> anything under 20 isn't something I would consider committed yet
[3:40:04] <BigYanno> I very much agree with him here
[3:40:07] <%Lion_kun> there are powerful spells that cast super quick and do tons of damage but they are dlc
[3:40:09] <SoaringTrumpet> the heavy soul spells too slow for my taste
[3:40:10] <+cubbywolf> not wurf
[3:40:14] <%IronOhki> poke poke poke though
[3:40:16] <%Orbital_Zero> I'd say go in the middle
[3:40:17] <MeImoth> get a soul arrow without the "Heavy" in it
[3:40:18] <%IronOhki> Hadokens.
[3:40:18] <+LokimenD> we need to find Reggie a BIG HAT
[3:40:19] <Dopamien> if reggie goes int + str he'll be ready for mlgs PogChamp
[3:40:19] <+cubbywolf> stratergems
[3:40:20] <Vaardvark> Soul Arrow and Heavy Soul Arrow are different classes, not an upgrade
[3:40:21] <+Shishi1205> @Lion_kun dark bead kinda beat
[3:40:23] <SarcFa> great soul arrow and soul arrow are much faster than great heavy soul
[3:40:26] <woweeezoweee> i wish Faith was easier to do in these games. i like having to help others but it sucks when the game dies down a bit
[3:40:30] <BigYanno> but if he can't get Great Heavy out because it's so slow then the damage of Great Heavy is actually 0
[3:40:30] <justcallmebobplease> Why would the damage be similar, and make the grander-named one just a slower, same-damage version?  That's horribly unintuitive design.
[3:40:30] <+cubbywolf> REEEE
[3:40:33] <royb2> Time for BLIGHTCON
[3:40:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:40:33] <%Ensign_Epic> @LokimenD big hat joe rogan

[3:43:58] <%jinking79> all those Luck drops and one Falling Death a Perfect Balance for Reggie
[3:44:01] <Crowroost> Great Soul Arrow is basic bittch fast spell but hits harder
[3:44:02] <woweeezoweee> @counterfeitgimmicks nope, its the worst part of dark souls lmao
[3:44:05] <Deasmeister> Also catalyst is unupgraded right
[3:44:06] <andre11dr> He really should just get the ORB instead
[3:44:07] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie sick parries BK, beats Asylum, proceeds to fall and die. The dichotomy of Dark Souls lol
[3:44:08] <%marrowslurp> @counterfeitgimmicks Nah
[3:44:22] <%haitakaa> homie soul arrow
[3:44:24] <Nogopharo> do it
[3:44:25] <sirrice77> You can equip multiple copies of a spell for more casts right?
[3:44:30] <QueequegTheater> There is no respec in DS1
[3:44:31] <Nogopharo> yes you can
[3:44:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @sirrice77 yes
[3:44:33] <theamazingaesoup> yeah

[3:44:38] <woweeezoweee> I remember my very first dark souls run i put like 5 levels into resistance and it literally crippled my run because i couldn't respec and just had to suffer
[3:44:38] <Kalinflip> strong jab

[3:44:53] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Forward
[3:44:54] <+Shishi1205> I think
[3:44:55] <QueequegTheater> @royb2 That's not until DS2
[3:45:04] <QueequegTheater> @CappuccinoGuil Among many other reasons

[3:46:42] <+Shishi1205> @woweeezoweee alive and well
[3:46:48] <MeImoth> lol this catalys is the best till super late and with 40+ INT
[3:46:53] <Crowroost> Current basic catalyst will be best in mid-20 to 40 INT ranges.
[3:46:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ensign_Epic there's no way he puts 28 into int

[3:53:10] <scrubsintodreams> Basically the area where the Hunter Invader spawns in the Cummmfpk Dungeon is right underneath the axe, but when you load the dungeon that area isn't loaded in.... But the traps still work, but the AI can't react to it. Thus it dies off screen.

[3:56:28] <+Shishi1205> He gives arguably one of the best rings in the game
[3:56:29] <glass_marcus> Havel does not respect your normal ass shield
[3:56:32] <+wynnewake> poise personified
[3:56:41] <Johannen> Parry dat shiz
[3:56:44] <OblivionSword1> rub that booty
[3:56:44] <%CateHecate> right through the shield, somehow
[3:56:44] <%Ensign_Epic> funny thing is - you can literally just pivot most, if not all, of those R1s into a backstab
[3:56:45] <+HelloImTom08> or LEARN to PARRY
[3:56:45] <AthenaAegis> Ah, I see you've met Havel Kappa

[3:56:52] <+askalta> he's very parryable
[3:56:53] <%CappuccinoGuil> If you're not hitting the back, you're not doing it right KappaPride
[3:56:54] <zzNamttamzz> Baller shield can handle that
[3:56:56] <velgaduere> respect the booty
[3:57:00] <%Dakuu75> You are not clapping manually?
[3:57:01] <BigYanno> you can, if you have a good shield and lots of stamina, survive ONE hit to the shield.
[3:57:03] <%SirGO0SE> I want a mod that puts a Supreme texture on Havel
[3:57:08] <user_naim> god he’s so sick
[3:57:08] <TheAmazingNick> Nice spacing without rolling. Reggie is getting good
[3:57:10] <+Shishi1205> @Ensign_Epic Bro some of his attacks have insane tracking if you are a bit far
[3:57:14] <%IronOhki> @Dakuu75 I've set my clapping to automatic from time to time.
[3:57:19] <%Rafraud> I think woolie is keeping reggie from getting TOO good at parrying so he doesn't steamroll right now
[3:57:21] <Crowroost> Shoulder sniffing, the new hype drugs all the cool kids are doing
[3:57:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @sirgo0se I woke up my dog laughing at that LUL
[3:57:37] <%Ensign_Epic> @Ensign_Epic Which is why you literally run into him while pivoting around him
[3:57:39] <AbnormalVoid> do a spin, that's a cool trick

[4:01:19] <Vaardvark> 25% and below is fast
[4:01:19] <%Ensign_Epic> Havel's isn't used on good builds if you can help it

[4:08:19] <woweeezoweee> ahh memories of how i played through ds1 the first time without ever meeting kaathe
[4:08:19] <AbnormalVoid> Great Soul Arrow, AKA Gun
[4:08:20] <+cubbywolf> poise through the attack

[4:08:40] <+eanscrale> Who doesn't love cake and pie?
[4:08:43] <%Irridium> Blightown has a lot of friendly animals :)
[4:08:43] <+Shishi1205> no soft humanity in a while
[4:08:49] <+cdrom321> @nogopharo Dung pies are pies, not cakes.
[4:08:49] <Crowroost> "no R2. never R2"
[4:08:52] <woweeezoweee> @AbnormalVoid how do you shoot the gun? its called the great soul arrow
[4:08:58] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe
[4:09:03] <%Supermonaman> The Rock has arrived! The man, the myth, the badass legend. You don't respect him you die LUL. Feel the poise and endurance. Cheer500

[4:10:45] <emptyantics> MADDENTWON BABY
[4:10:54] <Johannen> right in the heel
[4:10:57] <BurdRightsActivist> Is blighttown just madden town?
[4:10:59] <%Irridium> god I can feel that
[4:11:02] <andre11dr> Despite the memes tho Blighttown>,Valley of Defilement
[4:11:03] <%Ensign_Epic> This run is definitely longer than just going throw lower burg
[4:11:04] <user_naim> @expressnode nice
[4:11:05] <zhenthrim213> ACHILLES
[4:11:13] <%Ensign_Epic> through even
[4:11:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> POISE
[4:11:18] <+Shishi1205> Its pretty high
[4:11:18] <BurdRightsActivist> Blightcon 2021 coming to Maddentown!
[4:11:19] <+cubbywolf> comparatively
[4:11:22] <SheefEatsBeef> "lol didn't hurt"
[4:11:23] <subjectg> @andre11dr it’s a lot nicer now that the framerate doesn’t go to shit
[4:11:24] <%Irridium> you can go higher
[4:11:25] <tokio_red> Reggie be traversin like a champ now... step with confidence!
[4:11:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:11:28] <+Rasheedt> LUL
[4:11:30] <+Grayhammatter> it's pretty high, could be higher though
[4:11:33] <agustorm123> LUL
[4:11:36] <+HelloImTom08> LUL
[4:11:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> SIT DOWN
[4:11:37] <ExpressNode> Yes Sensei

[4:11:38] <+Shishi1205> other way
[4:11:39] <Equirah> other way
[4:11:41] <Scorchfield> nope other way
[4:11:43] <+Grayhammatter> other way
[4:11:46] <scarman125> if this was Dark Souls 3 his attacks would be getting interrupted even in full havel
[4:11:48] <dmtjinni> LUL
[4:11:49] <velgaduere> no your OTHER way
[4:11:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> larboard
[4:11:49] <Crowroost> My favorite Friends character is Moss
[4:11:51] <woweeezoweee> you finish your sentances BEFORE yyou start them
[4:11:52] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:11:53] <+robertoszek> your other right
[4:11:56] <user_naim> larboard
[4:11:57] <velgaduere> larstar
[4:11:58] <%Solidnick18> poor rat
[4:11:58] <+cubbywolf> tricked
[4:12:06] <%vVAstrAVv> stlarbard
[4:12:12] <+Grayhammatter> rats, rats, we are the rats
[4:12:14] <ExpressNode> Shit gotta install an update that might restart my computer
[4:12:18] <Equirah> @scarman125 from too prideful to admit they had the wrong digit in the poise code
[4:12:22] <emptyantics> For anyone that watched the Podcast, did they talk about Astroworld?
[4:12:28] <andre11dr> Remember when theses games had poise? Me neither
[4:12:34] <asakura_ayase> Larbard
[4:12:39] <Johannen> @scarman125 I was so distraught when i found out, DS3 sad times for Chonk
[4:12:39] <%Ensign_Epic> @scarman125 Poise works how it should but go off lmao
[4:12:39] <+BignanasTheGawd> reggie had like 4 choices and chose the worst option
[4:12:42] <SheefEatsBeef> rrat
[4:12:45] <+Wildorox> cool demon-pig-helmet
[4:12:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> rats rats we are the rats
[4:12:48] <+cubbywolf> sneak attack lets go
[4:12:49] <+robertoszek> Blightcon opening day is coming
[4:12:51] <woweeezoweee> i actually prefer the future dark souls lore where armor is purely fashion for the most part
[4:12:53] <+Shishi1205> just drop in the hole behind meat table
[4:12:56] <Crowroost> remember when in the earlier games magic was busted? Woolie doesn't.
[4:12:57] <user_naim> @emptyantics i don’t think they did
[4:13:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> y'all got your con tickets?
[4:13:04] <+cubbywolf> plunging attack here
[4:13:11] <+swesterly> Rats were rats
[4:13:12] <ExpressNode> Been on Windows 11 for about a month and surprisingly have had no issues like other people. Don't take my experience as the norm though
[4:13:24] <woweeezoweee> lets hope reggie doesnt melee the boxes in this area
[4:13:25] <user_naim> @cappuccinoguil hell yeah
[4:13:33] <Crowroost> did he show reggie the INSTANT lighting change at Blightcon doors yet?
[4:13:37] <%CateHecate> Big Smelly PooPoo Town
[4:13:38] <scarman125> @Ensign_Epic poise is a non stat that doesn't do anything what are you talking about? I beat Dark Souls 3 with a strength build out of spite you think I don't know?
[4:13:39] <+cubbywolf> mmm goop
[4:13:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> niiiice thrust
[4:13:45] <+BignanasTheGawd> get the bonfire first tho
[4:13:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Crowroost haven't got there yet
[4:13:53] <+Grayhammatter> nice thrust
[4:13:54] <subjectg> good ol thrussy
[4:13:55] <Equirah> @Ensign_Epic you can have DS poise in 3 by turning a 0 to 1 but who knows
[4:13:58] <user_naim> ! BRITNEY SPEARS !
[4:13:58] <infiniteFERN> is it time for the con?
[4:14:00] <+cubbywolf> gooped
[4:14:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BULLSHIT
[4:14:04] <+Shishi1205> thats a grab hitbox
[4:14:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:14:05] <%vVAstrAVv> i hate the splash noises in ds1

[4:14:09] <%Rafraud> LETS GOOOO
[4:14:09] <+Shishi1205> Good mash
[4:14:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> The SUCC
[4:14:10] <woweeezoweee> the claymore is another dark souls waifu of mine
[4:14:11] <+Jiggisnipe> looks like it worked
[4:14:12] <%Juriasu> Kreygasm aaaah
[4:14:12] <zhenthrim213> oh
[4:14:13] <%Rafraud> GOOD MASH
[4:14:13] <Crowroost> Fuck yeah Ooze, all my turtle homies love Ooze
[4:14:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYYE
[4:14:16] <LunarRemix> Green and Large titanite
[4:14:19] <BigYanno> and large titanite shards
[4:14:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Get out of here Ms. Paltrow
[4:14:24] <%Ensign_Epic> @scarman125 I am literally a FUGS main. Poise works exactly how it should in DS3. Just because it doesn't work how you specifically want it to work, doesn't mean it does not work
[4:14:25] <BigYanno> which I always do
[4:14:25] <%CateHecate> green shards are fucking useless though lol
[4:14:26] <Johannen> Far easier to farm leeches
[4:14:27] <woweeezoweee> what are green titanite for again?
[4:14:29] <Deko_> Kreygasm
[4:14:29] <+cubbywolf> get outa here ghost, this is Reggarths fire
[4:14:30] <%vVAstrAVv> its needed alright
[4:14:31] <+Shishi1205> Yo havel chillin
[4:14:33] <%IronOhki> And the rats around the corner for humanity.
[4:14:36] <Crowroost> Ooze... GREEN shards... mutagen...
[4:14:39] <+Grayhammatter> yo, havel was just chilling
[4:14:39] <agustorm123> ROCK IN THA HOUSE
[4:14:39] <%Rafraud> He didn't see the havel ghost lol
[4:14:40] <SarcFa> slugs in blight are better for green, since they can drop 5 green per drop
[4:14:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @woweeezoweee magic and fire i hink
[4:14:43] <+BignanasTheGawd> blightcon so close
[4:14:48] <tokio_red> *Very* low rate indeed.
[4:14:52] <DrkJP520> There are some boss grabs you can wiggle out of without even taking damage, one of which is gaping dragon
[4:14:54] <+nharliecash> DRAIN THE SWAMP
[4:14:56] <BigYanno> if you're doing faith build you're probably going to spend some time farming those dudes
[4:14:59] <+ArtemisCroc> green are for fire, magic and divine
[4:15:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S TIME
[4:15:09] <%CateHecate> [domnhall voice] brown hole
[4:15:10] <SheefEatsBeef> aye siwmae

[4:45:25] <Johannen> It does not add to resistance stat but blocks poison attacks when you block

[4:45:31] <JetpackMcQuack> the primordial liar
[4:45:34] <%CateHecate> but theres no casters in this area, so

[5:07:01] <Crowroost> I'm slippin' under
[5:07:09] <+cubbywolf> yeah, I don't think it was bad, but the mistakes are punished severely
[5:07:12] <%Ensign_Epic> Damn good job today, Reggie. Got a shitload of really cool & unique drops, and just completely downloaded the entire game with that Stray Demon fight. Keep it up, you're gonna be kicking Gwyn's ass in no time.

[5:08:01] <+cubbywolf> greenest dungeon
[5:08:20] <%marrowslurp> The best part of blightcon is that you have to pass the checkpoint on the way out too
[5:08:22] <%SirGO0SE> dig bickin
[5:08:24] <%IronOhki> Okay, the boys can't do it cuz music right, but everyone go manually play Toxic by Britney for the outro.

[5:08:52] <@Solidus_113> Havel's shield is 100/90/80/80
[5:08:52] <+Grayhammatter> BECOME GIANT
[5:08:59] <+Shishi1205> @kazadaz butterfly, stray demon, blightown

[5:09:08] <%marrowslurp> Rokin' that big O-spear i bet
[5:09:12] <SeruraRenge> It's a shame they didn't start this playthrough a little later, because they couldn't downloaded the Remastest mod for maximum memery
[5:09:12] <+BignanasTheGawd> you still got time to ditch books and hit the gym more
[5:09:12] <+Bitscreed> @kazadaz Havel, Butterfly and Stray Demon down. First bonfire in Blighttown reached.
[5:09:16] <tokio_red> I love Havel's gauntlets

[5:11:02] <dmtjinni> HOW do u spell that?
[5:11:03] <+Awkward_Cyborg> it looks pretty great
[5:11:07] <%IronOhki> Everything is souls like.
[5:11:07] <%Deekman> Lies of P
[5:11:09] <+TheOlMitcheroo> It looks ACTUALLY good
[5:11:10] <@Solidus_113> It looks better than Vampyr
[5:11:11] <+gitgouda> nioh <3
[5:11:11] <DeathByPoke7> Nioh baybee
[5:11:12] <andre11dr> Also, i told you Reggie would forget to use his spell, HE DID
[5:11:13] <SheefEatsBeef> nioh are the good ones
[5:11:13] <drunken_lemur> The Surge
[5:11:13] <%marrowslurp> It's a genere man
[5:11:13] <velgaduere> TOO MANY
[5:11:14] <%IronOhki> EVERYTHING is inspired by Souls.
[5:11:14] <+RyTYoung> oh bot
[5:11:15] <+Grayhammatter> nioh
[5:11:15] <+FxyDEV> Nioh raw
[5:11:15] <%BisoromiBear> Lyza P
[5:11:15] <+HelloImTom08> its become HUGE
[5:11:15] <+mitchpitchfork> NIOH
[5:11:18] <oda_flobunaga> NIOH
[5:11:18] <dmtjinni> @Awkward_Cyborg how do you spell game name?
[5:11:18] <+RyTYoung> boy*
[5:11:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Oh yes it's genre for real now
[5:11:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Nioh is #1
[5:11:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reggie's already feeling the itch
[5:11:22] <+HelloImTom08> it made a whole genere
[5:11:22] <velgaduere> Lords of the Fallen LUL
[5:11:25] <%Irridium> Nioh the best copy
[5:11:27] <+robertoszek> N I O H
[5:11:29] <%andrewofbob> Blasphemous is a good 2D take
[5:11:32] <LunarRemix> what
[5:11:33] <+mitchpitchfork> NIOH is perfect for mah boi
[5:11:33] <+cubbywolf> k well the answer to this question is 2 hours long so ill bbl
[5:11:35] <miucsa51> Let it Die
[5:11:36] <+kinmarik> hollow knight
[5:11:39] <+Awkward_Cyborg> @dmtjinni Lies of P
[5:11:41] <Equirah> Nioh isn't even the same LUL
[5:11:45] <MeImoth> LOTS of garbage Undertale fangames though
[5:11:46] <andre11dr> Nioh is the most successful Souls rip off
[5:11:47] <@Solidus_113> Undertale clones require good writing
[5:11:47] <%Deekman> Undertale clones would require good quirky writing
[5:11:50] <+FxyDEV> every action game took souls combat
[5:11:50] <dmtjinni> @Awkward_Cyborg thx
[5:11:57] <%kyh9> Lots of games ripped off the Fourth Wall Breaking from Undertale
[5:11:58] <bear_breaker20> ripping of a AAA title is different than ripping off an indie even undertale
[5:12:06] <drunken_lemur> Dead Cells
[5:12:14] <SeruraRenge> arguably Nioh is the only one that succeeded
[5:12:15] <+Jiggisnipe> Nioh is clearly inspired by Souls, Ninja Gaiden, and Diablo. Developers have said so
[5:12:18] <+gitgouda> some cases its nioh
[5:12:19] <+vaderxyz1970> Titan Souls
[5:12:19] <@Solidus_113> TItan Souls
[5:12:22] <@Solidus_113> really bad
[5:12:23] <the_angelon_experience> they kinda have rip off Undertale's writing but never the gameplay
[5:12:25] <%Deekman> SEGA called Yakuza: OF THE END, Yakuza: Dead Souls to capitalize on the Souls name
[5:12:27] <+JustToWatch> Dark Souls permanently changed the landscape like a fucking meteor
[5:12:30] <+vaderxyz1970> The Surge
[5:12:31] <%marrowslurp> Titan souls is weird
[5:12:35] <IronOhki> Tight combat. Hitbox porn. Shortcut porn. Dark Fantasy. Corpse Run. Challenging Bosses.
[5:12:37] <+vaderxyz1970> The Surge 2
[5:12:39] <@Solidus_113> Salt and Sanctuary
[5:12:41] <%IronOhki> Pick a few, it's a Souls like.
[5:12:46] <%Deekman> Hollowknight
[5:12:47] <Grim1952> Surge 2 is ok
[5:12:47] <+robertoszek> Lords of the Fallen too
[5:12:52] <mikesapartment> mortal shell
[5:12:52] <@Solidus_113> Mortal Shell
[5:12:52] <+Shishi1205> nioh has money
[5:12:52] <andre11dr> And then there's stuff that is slightly influenced by Souls, like God of War 2018
[5:12:54] <%Deekman> Salt & Sanctuary
[5:12:55] <+kinmarik> dont forget the npcs
[5:13:02] <justcallmebobplease> Fuck I wanna see Reggie hit Nioh, I know it's years and years off but damn!
[5:13:02] <+RemedyofRevenge> Hollow Knight is a good one
[5:13:04] <%marrowslurp> Surge
[5:13:05] <Darren716> The Surge
[5:13:08] <%Indigo_Automaton> The Surge
[5:13:10] <+RyTYoung> The Surge
[5:13:12] <+mitchpitchfork> Nioh is my cocaine
[5:13:12] <oda_flobunaga> Code Vein
[5:13:13] <%IronOhki> @RemedyofRevenge Souls like Metroidvania.
[5:13:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh yeah that one
[5:13:15] <huskarl_zap> surge
[5:13:16] <%LastHazzerd> The Surge
[5:13:17] <+JustToWatch> Also there are so many games that borrowed mechanics
[5:13:18] <SeruraRenge> does Dragon's Dogma count?
[5:13:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Hollow Knight is probably the best 2d one
[5:13:21] <DrkJP520> Don't forget the best souls game of all: beyond two souls
[5:13:21] <supergoblinpunch> Surge was super jank
[5:13:23] <%LordSDB> Let it Die is fun, the grind can be for upgrading gear can be real crazy tho
[5:13:23] <+FxyDEV> more like Code Lame lmao
[5:13:24] <TheyCallMeVawn> Life of P looks like its gonna be great
[5:13:24] <@Solidus_113> Anime souls with Code Vein
[5:13:26] <+HelloImTom08> Salt was cool
[5:13:29] <velgaduere> and it's ugly as fucking sin
[5:13:29] <Grim1952> The surge 1 is awful though, skip to 2
[5:13:29] <Equirah> Hollow Knight is souls, you dudes wilding LUL
[5:13:31] <Bonebagmel> Ashen: co op dark souls
[5:13:32] <+RyTYoung> Hollow Knight has big inspiration
[5:13:32] <MinersLoveGames> Salt And Sanctuary is fucking AMAZING.
[5:13:32] <+BignanasTheGawd> Blasphemous
[5:13:35] <%Irridium> Oh yeah Code Vein
[5:13:36] <zzNamttamzz> Mortal Shell, get HARD
[5:13:36] <%hax_metatron> It’s a genre on Steam now you can find 4747474 of them
[5:13:38] <oda_flobunaga> Hollow Knight
[5:13:38] <+RemedyofRevenge> Dead Cells has some aspects too
[5:13:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Deaths Gambit is sick
[5:13:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> bird souls with deaths door
[5:13:44] <%ekodrop> yall played code vein
[5:13:46] <+alphonseisbest> Deaths gambit was cool
[5:13:47] <%Deekman> oh yeah Blasphemous for sure
[5:13:48] <Basic_Birch_> blasphemous
[5:13:50] <+FxyDEV> iron pineapple covers a ton of indie souls clones
[5:13:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> Silksong BibleThump
[5:13:51] <SheefEatsBeef> X it is the Dark Souls of Y
[5:13:52] <%LordSDB> Best thing about Let It Die is that soundtrack tho
[5:13:53] <+Grayhammatter> hollow knight is so good
[5:13:54] <%marrowslurp> The creator of SnS said he just wanted to create 2d Dark Souls
[5:13:54] <the_angelon_experience> HK is 80% regular Metroidvania
[5:13:57] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Blasphemous is awesome
[5:13:59] <miucsa51> just like BOTW DS created alot of imitators
[5:14:04] <%hax_metatron> “Soulslike” is a filterable genre on Steam
[5:14:05] <%Lion_kun> Hollow Knight
[5:14:05] <SheefEatsBeef> yeah nioh is great
[5:14:06] <+gitgouda> hell yeah it does
[5:14:09] <MeImoth> Nioh 1 and 2 are amazing
[5:14:11] <oda_flobunaga> Combat wise
[5:14:13] <%IronOhki> @hax_metatron Damn, didn't know that.
[5:14:14] <%Prevot> best 2D dark souls was Momodora IV
[5:14:14] <TheyCallMeVawn> Nioh is fucking incredible
[5:14:15] <Bonebagmel> nioh does TOO MUCH
[5:14:15] <valriot> Nioh is half Souls, half Diablo
[5:14:16] <+RyTYoung> @frostedzaibatsu The more times you speak of Silksong the further away it is BibleThump
[5:14:16] <%vVAstrAVv> HELL YEAH IT DOES
[5:14:17] <andre11dr> In some places
[5:14:17] <+pectusumbra> Nioh 2 has custom devil triggers doesn't it?
[5:14:18] <+Grayhammatter> nioh 1 and 2 are nice
[5:14:18] <%HeroToxiko> stares in ninja gaiden
[5:14:19] <dmtjinni> Nioh is anti-fun
[5:14:20] <supergoblinpunch> Nioh is its own thing
[5:14:20] <+BignanasTheGawd> NIOH actually explains shit
[5:14:22] <%CapnClassix> Nioh is much more mechaincally complex
[5:14:22] <%sewermonk> can never be as bad as after Minecraft where every game got a crafting system added woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[5:14:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nioh 2 is probably my favorite souls-like, it's great
[5:14:31] <%hax_metatron> But it’s loot based and not as good with lore
[5:14:37] <blackpegaso> Sekiro
[5:14:41] <+robertoszek> Is like Doom-like and Rogue-like became genres
[5:14:50] <Grim1952> Nioh 2 burned me out, it's so repetitive
[5:14:53] <FrostedZaibatsu> @RyTYoung sadness hggPain hggPain hggPain
[5:14:53] <SeruraRenge> @hax_metatron I mean the lore of Nioh is just japanese history
[5:14:56] <andre11dr> Niohs downside is that the bosses and the level design is not as good as Souls
[5:14:59] <+RyTYoung> Minecraft was also a big game changer in the industry
[5:15:06] <+Jiggisnipe> Sekiro is more Tenchu with some Souls shit
[5:15:13] <%IronOhki> Agree.
[5:15:16] <JdotSweapA> its a soulslike...
[5:15:16] <SheefEatsBeef> thats fair
[5:15:20] <%A_German_spy> Yeah.
[5:15:22] <%Irridium> Tenchu :(
[5:15:25] <tokio_red> Have to head off a bit early on my end. Thanks for the fantastic strea, Reggie, Woolie, and fellow chat! Have a good one.
[5:15:32] <SeruraRenge> Sekiro is the Tenchu game FROM wished they made back in the day instead of that godawful Tenchu game they did make
[5:15:32] <valriot> Sekiro is... fine
[5:15:33] <tokio_red> Thanks for the fun times
[5:15:34] <+RyTYoung> @frostedzaibatsu I bet they announce the release date and it'll be a month out
[5:15:43] <%vVAstrAVv> sekiro sucks too
[5:15:44] <Equirah> corpse runs aren't even a souls original idea
[5:15:45] <VincentGraves> sekiro is the shit
[5:15:47] <@Solidus_113> Sekiro has the Souls bosses
[5:15:50] <%hax_metatron> SEKIRO = Tenchu Rhythm game that is BALLS HARD
[5:15:51] <+Jiggisnipe> Nioh is closer to souls than Sekiro
[5:16:02] <andre11dr> Remember that wierd ghost game Fromsoft made?
[5:16:04] <%Deekman> feel like chat was a lot calmer with the backseating this week
[5:16:06] <%Orbital_Zero> YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!
[5:16:06] <%Mushinronja> sekiro salties

[5:16:11] <+robertoszek> LUL
[5:16:17] <%marrowslurp> Does Sekiro even have corpse run? can's remember
[5:16:25] <%Mushinronja> i don't think so
[5:16:31] <+patel347> boss as keys
[5:16:34] <%Mushinronja> it has the dumb 30% chance to not lose stuff mechanic
[5:16:36] <oda_flobunaga> Sekiro's lack of Build variety got to me
[5:16:37] <%marrowslurp> Settels it then
[5:16:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you know, in monster hunter almost every enemy is a boss
[5:16:42] <SeruraRenge> if anyhting Nioh is way more of that than Souls games because every Nioh map that isn't a dueling arena is just a series of shortcuts
[5:16:44] <+theoldone001> IGN is the Dark Souls of reviewers
[5:16:48] <chaos2frozen> @marrowslurp no, your resource auto decrease a percentage I believe
[5:16:54] <+RyTYoung> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Including those damn Kestrodons Kappa

[5:17:18] <+BignanasTheGawd> my ass is the Dark souls of shidding
[5:17:19] <+RemedyofRevenge> Absolver has a similar PvP system @WoolieVersus
[5:17:38] <+Bitscreed> Huh. TIL
[5:17:41] <%Deekman> didn't remastered add a password matchmaking system?
[5:17:50] <%A_German_spy> Same system from DS3's matchmaking, yeah.
[5:17:52] <+HelloImTom08> really? thats dumb
[5:17:53] <+FxyDEV> now mages can just one shot you instead
[5:17:53] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Hey chat, I had to leave after he beat Havel. How much more did he doÉ
[5:17:54] <%Ensign_Epic> Eeeeeh, no
[5:17:54] <+twohitgood> you also need to stay human to get invasions
[5:18:02] <+patel347> also you arent human
[5:18:03] <%Ensign_Epic> The ranges are freaking HUGE in this game
[5:18:05] <%marrowslurp> They introduced weapon based matchmaking from 3
[5:18:07] <royb2> @HelloImTom08 nah its better
[5:18:10] <+Jiggisnipe> @GilroyGoldBlood reached 1st bonfire in Blighttown
[5:18:11] <+RyTYoung> @kosorsomesaykosm_ *me ripping through about 8 of them in LR after 50 hours of game time doodNuts
[5:18:15] <zzNamttamzz> Fully upgraded armor is OK tho
[5:18:15] <@Solidus_113> you can set up passcodes
[5:18:18] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Jiggisnipe Sick, thanks
[5:18:21] <%hax_metatron> It’s badly implemented weapon matchmaking basically
[5:18:22] <%IronOhki> I love Absolver, I wish it was good.
[5:18:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @GilroyGoldBlood he made it to blightcon 2021
[5:18:23] <%hax_metatron> Yes you can
[5:18:27] <+cdrom321> @gilroygoldblood Ended at mid Blightcon bonfire.
[5:18:28] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus can we do some password matchmaking funzies with chat at some stage?
[5:18:34] <DrkJP520> I believe Liam played through Demon's Souls in co-op
[5:18:34] <%hax_metatron> All of them. Later games have scaled match making so you’re good
[5:18:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @RyTYoung they had it coming
[5:18:36] <+Bitscreed> DS2 was good for that with the password system.
[5:18:37] <DeathByPoke7> absolver was really cool on paper
[5:18:38] <%IronOhki> Absolver is a tragedy. Such a brilliant game that just didn't come together.
[5:18:41] <Grim1952> Absolver had so much potential
[5:18:50] <lotharrio> Bloodborne is the best, fight me cowards.
[5:18:54] <%marrowslurp> I miss getting invaded by chaos zwei+5. I realy do
[5:18:56] <+RyTYoung> @kosorsomesaykosm_ they always start shit first
[5:18:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dark souls pvp is legit good for footsies learning
[5:19:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lotharrio you are correct
[5:19:07] <%andrewofbob> Different structure of game, but I'm looking forward to Sifu
[5:19:14] <SeruraRenge> Nioh just dropped invasions altogether and made it about co-op, pvp is only in arenas
[5:19:17] <+Jiggisnipe> this is FASHION SOULS
[5:19:18] <+Grayhammatter> BaconKnight lets go
[5:19:22] <+HelloImTom08> the Boar Knight
[5:19:22] <andre11dr> Absolver had a lot of potential, but it didn't work like they wanted it to
[5:19:24] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus dsr and the rest of the more recent dark souls games have password mechanics for coop/dueling
[5:19:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gargoyle gang rise up
[5:19:29] <+patel347> you should definitely do dark souls pvp as part of getting into fighting games
[5:19:31] <Grim1952> Let the man enjoy his helmet
[5:19:33] <Cozy90> fashion souls best
[5:19:34] <+theoldone001> Woolie predator helmet from FS2
[5:19:36] <%IronOhki> Nah, Gargoyle is a totally different vibe.

[5:23:14] <SeruraRenge> Those guns are amazing, they basically turn dark souls into RE4/5

[5:29:21] <+RyTYoung> You'll be fighting a lot me NPC like enemies in the later games, so yeah, PvP is worth it
[5:29:25] <bobxmaker> took me an entire day to get to that bonfire my first time through
[5:29:26] <+RyTYoung> more*
[5:29:54] <KingSpunf> There is no second hit. Die
[5:29:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You have infinity tries
[5:30:42] <+xyxlzyzm> @RyTYoung lol NPC and PvP are SO different what are you saying
[5:30:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I only ever even got to that first bonfire once, and that was enough. Every subsequent playthrough I took the master key and speedran it through the back
[5:31:24] <bobxmaker> i think a thing that's good to get in early is that souls you aquire inbetween bosses don't really matter, all the souls you really need is from the bosses.
