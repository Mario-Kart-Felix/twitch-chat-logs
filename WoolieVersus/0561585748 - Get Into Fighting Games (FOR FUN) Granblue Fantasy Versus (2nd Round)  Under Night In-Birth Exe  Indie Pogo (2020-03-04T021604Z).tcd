[0:06:00] <%Irridium> @arkv01 even more infuriating human japanese egos. "that's just not how we do things"
[0:06:01] <itsgutsnotgatsu> majin obama has a couple videos touching on this topic
[0:06:18] <Decsevm> I am still for ever sad that it was fighting is magic
[0:06:25] <%Monkeyweed21> SFV visualizing frame advantage
[0:06:36] <Thunderhog> "but we cant do what they did, or we'd be called out for copying"
[0:06:38] <+Psycosis> seeing your characters colors when you're choosing them that Street Fighter didn't get until 5
[0:06:38] <%Irridium> c'mooooooon that league of legends fighting game. Pull it all together and become the Omni-Fighter
[0:06:41] <Decsevm> healthy except for capcom
[0:06:43] <@Solidus_113> Send the idea to Esteban
[0:06:47] <+Psycosis> Seeing frame date
[0:06:48] <@Solidus_113> or Sajam
[0:06:58] <$razielhex> Esteban? That Spanish guitar player?
[0:06:59] <+Nomicro4u> pretty sure capcom and namco have several patents on mechanics

[0:07:17] <itsgutsnotgatsu> esteban from hold back to block
[0:07:22] <Thunderhog> Like the devils advocate is "we cant just copy other peoples ideas" but seriously. QoL shouldn't be a idea that people need to have as a unique feature
[0:07:24] <$razielhex> Seein' that animu reflection right now
[0:07:26] <%Irridium> not even the version that launched, remember the first alpha that had fucking weapon degradation? shit sucked.
[0:07:31] <+ASovietSharkPro> I want Melty Blood to be healthier again
[0:08:02] <%tearfuldevil> bad qol (on not-niche games) and bad netcode are why i, a newcomer and scrub, am not into fighting games as much as i wish i was
[0:08:02] <%Sparkseid> even if they do, still do it
[0:08:04] <arkv01> healthy fiber leads to healthy melty blood scene
[0:08:09] <+ChrisPlaysThing> Quality of Life is one of 3 key points in game design
[0:08:10] <+NotHereToStream> no.1 on the list : GGPO
[0:08:16] <+Psycosis> Do it cowards,it's currently being stolen as you speak. just not by me
[0:08:30] <+ASovietSharkPro> ark gets it
[0:08:35] <Decsevm> is woolie going to spawn a new YouTuber like eyepatchwolf
[0:08:38] <%Irridium> I also wish more were "co-op" in the sense like games with tag-teams letting me play with a friend. Or the 3v3's letting me and 2 other friends play on the same team
[0:08:41] <%tearfuldevil> i can't make locals regularly, so so many fighting games having terrible online experiences kills it for me pretty much
[0:08:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Let's start with baby steps: GGPO
[0:08:58] <+ASovietSharkPro> Melty Blood is the shit, man
[0:09:00] <%Irridium> that 3v3 mode in fighterz is dumb fun. Just a shame the netcode is so ass every online match of it is garbage
[0:09:01] <%tearfuldevil> @Irridium yeah i wanna be carried lol
[0:09:02] <rcgama> Just put Dramatic Battle in every fg
[0:09:44] <%SomersaultJustice> wolly 2, electric boogaloo
[0:10:05] <Royalguard22> Good Guy Woolie, educating the community

[0:10:43] <+Psycosis> I watched your fight stick vid recently again before I bought the one I have now
[0:10:44] <+SeventhVice> thought Woolie was waiting until the western release
[0:10:51] <%Irridium> I mean yeah you can play just fine with a controller. It's how I play most fighting games save street fighter and guilty gear
[0:11:05] <TigerClaws12> Gamerfinger > Sanwa :)

[0:18:23] <+DarkNerdShawny> Time to play some ANIME!
[0:18:25] <%Exiliator> I remember playing lethal league in school, when it was still a flash prototype
[0:18:33] <@Solidus_113> I could buy the ArcSys bundle on Fanatical for some extra codes to give away. Someone can get Arcana Heart
[0:18:37] <%Exiliator> Best way to waste time
[0:18:39] <+GuyFromRedBank> And if you are not 100% satisfied, we'll give you your money back.
[0:18:45] <%yeknomlive> double zeta
[0:18:50] <kiso52> thunderbolt
[0:18:51] <dinosiurry> Was that the flash prototype where it was only one character and you couldn't move?

[0:19:04] <+novanazo> SEED DESTINY is bad
[0:19:04] <+chill_o_wisp> IBO is sick
[0:19:06] <%alrobot2014> seed destiny can die in a fire
[0:19:06] <keiji_maede> good old G gundam
[0:19:07] <%Irridium> 08th MS Team
[0:19:08] <+bustawof> g gundam is rad

[0:19:18] <kiso52> GET THAT JAZZ BRAH
[0:19:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> SEED AND SEED DESTINY starts now
[0:19:22] <CalderGaming> worst: tie between SEED Destiny and Build Divers. best: turn-A, thunderbolt, 08th ms, war in the pocket
[0:19:24] <%tearfuldevil> g gundam is rad, although its a bit racist
[0:19:28] <$razielhex> Macrosse is good
[0:19:30] <%Sparkseid> Seed Destiny swerve hard away from
[0:19:32] <+SuperSolidSnake64> Reconguista in G is disjointed and weird but I'm into it
[0:19:33] <+bustawof> burning fingah
[0:19:34] <%Irridium> "a bit" LUL
[0:19:36] <arkv01> double zeta is underrated
[0:19:40] <$razielhex> FINGAT
[0:19:41] <%CommanderBrocken> ZETA baby
[0:19:43] <+NekoNinja13> zeta, zz, ibo, war in the Pocket, and build fighters
[0:19:44] <%Exiliator> @dinosiurry yup yup
[0:19:44] <@CrankyVT> Pretty much anything in the UC era is quality
[0:19:44] <%Sparkseid> Zeta top tier
[0:19:45] <arkv01> aNIME JANAI, ANIME JANAI
[0:19:47] <kiso52> the origin is great tho
[0:19:48] <%yeknomlive> the ending of 0079 is magical
[0:19:50] <+TransparentTee> Gundam 00 is pretty nice
[0:19:51] <+Mr_Initials> @WoolieVersus do you want to give away a copy of distance I have?
[0:19:55] <$razielhex> fgsfds
[0:20:01] <%ozzrabbit> G Gundam.
[0:20:03] <CalderGaming> g-reco is the one I lament the most because it tried to do 52 episodes of stuff in 26
[0:20:07] <arkv01> whoa hold on son
[0:20:09] <ikantreeed> I gave up on gundam, it's too complicated for nothing. i'm tired
[0:20:10] <shitthedd> f91 goat
[0:20:13] <KaseKaizer> technically F91 is UC
[0:20:14] <Solidnick18> gundam 00 is pretty good
[0:20:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> SEED
[0:20:17] <arkv01> and your outtro LUL
[0:20:17] <%SomersaultJustice> G Gundam is the only one I finished
[0:20:21] <Solidnick18> LUL seed
[0:20:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's the worst
[0:20:21] <+JerseyBleek> f91 is uc
[0:20:23] <%CommanderBrocken> f91 is uc ah heck
[0:20:24] <+TransparentTee> Gundam seed is garbage
[0:20:24] <aojr1010> f91 is late uc
[0:20:27] <%LowSkillGod> oh shid is it over?
[0:20:29] <Decsevm> seed was so bad
[0:20:31] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:20:31] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Yo do you still watch Kamen Rider?
[0:20:31] <+TransparentTee> the only good thing about it is the gundam designs
[0:20:36] <CalderGaming> f91 also suffers from being SUPER abridged
[0:20:39] <+TenguGemini> Seed has some cool looking suits
[0:20:40] <%SomersaultJustice> but it gave us augauguaguaguaugauguagug
[0:20:47] <%Irridium> reggie that clip of the kid crying on the spaceship is from SEED. that's how good the show is
[0:20:47] <ChinMusicTwo> But it had cool lasers and catchy pop tunes
[0:20:48] <tactyhack> stargazer is ace
[0:20:53] <%Irridium> from woolie's outro
[0:20:56] <arkv01> F91 was cut hard yeah, could've been a whole series
[0:20:56] <+TenguGemini> how do you feel about Turn A Gundam?
[0:20:58] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> The only gundam I've seen is the tournament one when it was on toonami
[0:21:04] <KaseKaizer> technically it's post UC because it's after the 100 year peroid known as a "Century"
[0:21:06] <%LowSkillGod> is woolie done with granblue?
[0:21:06] <CalderGaming> our *voyager*
[0:21:12] <kiso52> @WoolieVersus did you watch the origin? Char's battle scenes are mecha porn at three times the speed!

[0:22:27] <$razielhex> Cartoon Network started with Sailor Moon/Dragon Ball/Robotech for series, but it's first touch with Japanese animation was way back in 1992 when they played AKIRA and Vampire Hunter D at like 1am on Saturdays.
[0:22:28] <%webdesserts> @woolieversus When is the next pop off report??

[0:22:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> big green nuts
[0:22:50] <arkv01> like if you didn't watch double zeta, you can't enjoy unicorn
[0:22:50] <%Irridium> every granblue fan I talk to says avoid the anime LUL
[0:22:50] <Orenjevel> i prefer chocola chip
[0:22:53] <arkv01> to the fullest
[0:22:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Hey Woolie, what if someone invented a jetpack that works like your dream jetpack, but it's the ugliest, most visually unappealing thing you can possibly imagine? Would you still put it on?
[0:22:58] <Thunderhog> The gacha's a whole nother world
[0:22:58] <redrins> @Solidus_113 yeah thats the one with the milf

[0:23:15] <+JFKRobot> When does mhacademia get bad? I think I fell off before that
[0:23:16] <CalderGaming> the anime's a pretty bland retread of the early story quests
[0:23:25] <%Wool> Everyone sell your Granblue codes. I literally made $80 from mine.
[0:23:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'LL SHOW UP FOR THAT

[0:25:16] <a1337spy> are you gonna play classic doom/classic doom 2/doom 64 at some point? i know you loved doom 2016 and i wanna know what you'd think of the original games
[0:25:20] <+SeventhVice> Go hard on GBVS
[0:25:31] <dinosiurry> There are only two bad things about Skullgirls
[0:25:32] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Do you know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode?
[0:25:34] <dinosiurry> 1. No Umbrella
[0:25:37] <+NotHereToStream> no release date for uk yet :(
[0:25:40] <%Wool> GBVS LP
[0:25:40] <Thunderhog> RIGHT INTO RPG MODE
[0:25:40] <%yeknomlive> coop time
[0:25:42] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:25:42] <dinosiurry> 2. MikeZ is indirectly responsible for Yandev
[0:25:46] <%Wool> RPG MODE LP
[0:25:54] <arkv01> oh dear god
[0:25:56] <%FrostedZaibatsu> This sounded like Witcher
[0:25:57] <arkv01> please no grinding
[0:26:00] <%ECRead> Beelezebub looks RAD
[0:26:03] <SkreamnRedSkull> @dinosiurry No he's not...
[0:26:05] <%Irridium> if you haven't jumped on yet you're gonna have to do some matches to get a rank before you can do the lobbies/rooms
[0:26:06] <MutedMimic> FeelsGoodMan
[0:26:06] <%Prinnylordninjocity> @alrobot2014 is it fun? I’d be down
[0:26:07] <Thunderhog> The co-op is fun
[0:26:09] <+Ancopro> ohno, he's lost to the gacha already
[0:26:12] <nothuzad> RPG mode also has coop mode!
[0:26:12] <@Solidus_113> Did you unlock any sword skins
[0:26:15] <%yeknomlive> move over Charlotte gran has a big boot
[0:26:16] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Do you know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode??
[0:26:24] <arkv01> yeah I was hoping woolie would LP the english rpg mode
[0:26:24] <purekyun> i've heard granblue's online is awful. is that true?
[0:26:32] <+DarkNerdShawny> Wait, why arent you playing in English?
[0:26:35] <$razielhex> It's all Moonspeak
[0:26:37] <%Wool> @purekyun it's delay based
[0:26:42] <%Wool> so yes
[0:26:42] <%Irridium> @purekyun It's... okay at best
[0:26:42] <Thunderhog> They didnt get the hk version
[0:26:43] <itsgutsnotgatsu> its normal delay based
[0:26:44] <arkv01> he bought it on japanese PSN cause he had money on jp PSN
[0:26:45] <dinosiurry> Yandev shared a story on /v/ how Mike Z insulted his terrible coding and it inspired him to make a game just to spite Mike @SkreamnRedSkull
[0:26:49] <%yeknomlive> @purekyun as bad as the other arc sys games. bad right now because most of na doesn't have yet
[0:26:53] <rad_dude123465> @purekyun it’s alright, not great but not bad either
[0:26:57] <%Wool> It's better than SFV's netplay
[0:26:58] <%alrobot2014> @Prinnylordninjocity its pretty basic really early in which is where i am in it, dunno if it gets better though
[0:27:03] <%ECRead> not Hong Kong version, Japanese ver
[0:27:11] <@Solidus_113> How long until Narmaya releases
[0:27:11] <CalderGaming> maximilian said the delay readout lies, but I haven't been able to confirm personally
[0:27:19] <+DarkNerdShawny> ohhh dang. JP release shouldve got the english version too.
[0:27:24] <arkv01> @Solidus_113 next month I think
[0:27:26] <%Wool> you get more colors by doing their Arcade modes too
[0:27:29] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Do you know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode?
[0:27:32] <%Irridium> @CalderGaming I did have a match earlier that felt WAY worse than what the number said
[0:27:38] <+shadowmoonsama> @Wool LUL
[0:27:47] <+croxeye> sounds like you just need to go through the story and arcade modes to get the skins then
[0:28:04] <SkreamnRedSkull> @dinosiurry that doesn't make Mike Z or skullgirls associated with yandev, and also, he hasn't MADE anything!
[0:28:05] <rad_dude123465> I don’t see any ladiva, why don’t I see any ladiva??
[0:28:08] <%Wool> most skins you can just buy
[0:28:16] <+NotHereToStream> edgebringer
[0:28:23] <MutedMimic> LUL
[0:28:24] <$razielhex> Bill's a bub
[0:28:26] <Solidnick18> He's pretty cool looking
[0:28:27] <dinosiurry> I didn't say "associated", I said "indirectly responsible"
[0:28:28] <%Wool> BUBS
[0:28:29] <nothuzad> hes pretty hot
[0:28:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> he looks like an edgy edgy boy but he'll be fun as shit
[0:28:31] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:28:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie LOVES the Satan now
[0:28:35] <%yeknomlive> narmaya trailer on the 27th at least
[0:28:37] <arkv01> you can't escape from satan's influence, even in anime fighters LUL
[0:28:38] <%ECRead> Reminds me a bit of Raven from GG
[0:28:40] <$razielhex> I was not prepared for this level of weeaboo
[0:28:40] <eldragon_1> He has Diavolos voice too
[0:28:50] <%FenixSeraph> wish the framerate was better
[0:28:52] <%yeknomlive> zeta theme
[0:28:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeeeeeeeeeah
[0:28:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's even better
[0:29:01] <+Sulfur_Boride> Lancelot and Gran has Josuke' actor as well
[0:29:02] <arkv01> @razielhex welcome to the rice fields motherfucker
[0:29:03] <Triplicat> wonder if woolie saw those degenerate double overhead wall jump lancelot setups on twitter
[0:29:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Diavolo's voice actor is Kamina you weeb swine
[0:29:11] <kuitlapiltsontli> GBVS!!!
[0:29:47] <%Prinnylordninjocity> @monkeyweed21 really?
[0:29:49] <$razielhex> B U T !
[0:29:51] <eldragon_1> Holy crap that IS Kamina's voice
[0:29:55] <%FenixSeraph> is Granblue just the League of Legends of Japan but with better character artwork?
[0:30:03] <MutedMimic> Kappa
[0:30:14] <arkv01> @FenixSeraph as a fighting game? yeah
[0:30:33] <BackwardCap> No
[0:30:40] <nothuzad> FenixSeraph no cuz it isnt funded by a facist state :)
[0:30:42] <+bobfriskit> Oh? Woolie playing on controller?
[0:30:44] <kuitlapiltsontli> Granblue is more like Gacha One Piece
[0:30:45] <@Solidus_113> League had games before the fighter, unlike Granblue
[0:30:46] <+novanazo> She doesn't
[0:30:47] <$razielhex> @FenixSeraph The playerbase is probably less racist as long as you're not Korean.
[0:30:49] <+NotHereToStream> wait, doing just block doesn't give you better frame advantage in this game right?
[0:30:50] <Thunderhog> Give me your phone
[0:30:59] <@akuda_bar> @Solidus_113 damn
[0:31:04] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @NotHereToStream nah but it gives you meter
[0:31:07] <%tearfuldevil> @FenixSeraph i don't really like a lot of league's art from what i've seen, but i'm not really that big on granblue's art either, tbh
[0:31:08] <shitthedd> I believe IB just gives mroe meter
[0:31:09] <%Exiliator> l-lewd
[0:31:11] <Triplicat> only EX guard point stance is active frame 1
[0:31:15] <Thunderhog> Lacnce also has a different emtion for every opponent
[0:31:17] <+NotHereToStream> damn, well better than nothing
[0:31:20] <+Mr_Initials> Fugo
[0:31:33] <%shivvey> LANCELOT IS SO HANDSOME
[0:31:37] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @NotHereToStream I don't think you take chip damage on a just defend either
[0:31:41] <nothuzad> tearknack a lot of original GB art suffers from same face syndrome especially females
[0:31:43] <Thunderhog> If you beat lowain he looks like he's forcing a smile as he helps you up
[0:31:51] <+paladinstarbuster> WutFace
[0:31:54] <chaos2frozen> It was a lady on the UI team, she plays the original game lol
[0:31:54] <%tearfuldevil> @nothuzad Ladiva is neat, and so is the big scythe boy, i guess? nobody in the cast really does it for me
[0:31:56] <arkv01> I want the punished lancelot skin in this
[0:32:00] <+NotHereToStream> that's not bad i suppose
[0:32:03] <dinosiurry> So, redpill me on the game here. What's the systems it has that sets it apart? I see what looks like cooldown skills under each character's health..
[0:32:09] <%tearfuldevil> @nothuzad i should note i've only seen whats in gbfvs
[0:32:15] <kurdlez> EX moves are cooldown based
[0:32:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[0:32:23] <nothuzad> tearknack ye they dont use original art from the gacha
[0:32:23] <Thunderhog> @dinosiurry Ex moves dont take meter, instead they put that move on CD
[0:32:30] <+silvery_cricket> Grand that blue
[0:32:38] <+silvery_cricket> ...
[0:32:40] <gekizenbu> wallcelot would be too overpowered
[0:32:43] <Thunderhog> Super meter is entirely for supers and you get meter for moving forward and doing stuff
[0:32:44] <$razielhex> hahaha what
[0:32:52] <+Mr_Initials> And depending on if you did the input or pressed the auto hit it cools down faster
[0:32:57] <dinosiurry> Can you not use the move at all during cooldown, or just the EX version?
[0:33:00] <+RichardMF_> @dinosiurry it also has rolls that lose to lows and throws
[0:33:02] <Triplicat> can't use it at all
[0:33:04] <Thunderhog> Game has easy input button that treats specials like smash inputs
[0:33:06] <%tearfuldevil> @nothuzad mostly its just that i don't like anime or warhammer/warcraft style fantasy aesthetic
[0:33:07] <Triplicat> that's the deal
[0:33:07] <$razielhex> chip
[0:33:15] <Triplicat> if you EX DP you better have made it a good one
[0:33:18] <+novanazo> Zeta's 22x can be TK'd
[0:33:22] <$razielhex> FINAL ROUND HYPE!
[0:33:28] <Triplicat> since you don't have a DP for 480 or more frames after
[0:33:31] <%tearfuldevil> @nothuzad which is really why i dislike a lot of designs i've seen in league of legends so it balances out i guess
[0:34:02] <Thunderhog> @novanazo Never thought about TKing a 22 move...sounds like some hit box shit
[0:34:09] <$razielhex> PIXEL
[0:34:09] <mr_sups> @dinosiurry Special moves have cool downs. You can use simple inputs for for easier execution or complex inputs for shorter cool downs. Also auto combos are proximity based.
[0:34:10] <itsgutsnotgatsu> how does one tk a 22 motion
[0:34:25] <%FenixSeraph> @tearknack kind of the same, but Granblue's art does have a little more uniqueness and stylization relative to LoL's at least
[0:34:30] <+novanazo> you just do 282 then button
[0:34:42] <itsgutsnotgatsu> that makes sense
[0:34:43] <+novanazo> I own a regular stick and can do it
[0:34:49] <%FenixSeraph> it's just not my thing but I can appreciate a good Yoshida piece nonetheless
[0:34:55] <%DensityD> this is hype
[0:35:06] <dinosiurry> As someone who cannot full circle, that system does sound appealing.
[0:35:45] <nothuzad> lols artstyle is just the milqutoast comic artstyle and when they get new skins they spice it up to make it more interesting V:
[0:35:56] <Thunderhog> Yeah, easy input helps with characters like ladiva to do 720 with just a 236 input, and charlotta to do charge moves with 1 button
[0:36:21] <kurdlez> regi should prob use more EX mores since they dont cost resource, just cooldown
[0:36:21] <+Dr_DangerPhD> charlotta can pull off some bullshit since she can easy input charge moves lmao
[0:36:24] <kurdlez> p important
[0:36:25] <%Exiliator> Sokoda! Sokoda! Sokoda!
[0:36:43] <kuitlapiltsontli> Zetabros....
[0:36:49] <Triplicat> I have won matches with full screen dash forward EX flash kick anti-air
[0:36:59] <+novanazo> @WoolieVersus Reggie, Zeta doesn't have any frame 1 reversals
[0:37:00] <Triplicat> i don't feel good about it but l o l
[0:37:15] <raveous> isn't there a counter?
[0:37:18] <Triplicat> zeta EX parry is frame 1
[0:37:23] <raveous> yeh that
[0:37:26] <Triplicat> others frame 3
[0:37:36] <+novanazo> it's a stance
[0:37:55] <CalderGaming> zeta's shading makes her look more obviously 3DCG than lance for some reason
[0:37:56] <+novanazo> even if you get out of it you still have to act out and all the follow ups aren't frame 1
[0:38:01] <BinaryShuffle> Reggie!
[0:38:03] <dinosiurry> Tell you what the worst part of controller playing is: when an input gets misread and my fighter jumps when I'm in the middle of entering a complex move.
[0:38:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, you wanna give away a steam code for nidhogg i got?
[0:38:12] <+NotHereToStream> no one can ever block the overhead Kappa
[0:38:14] <shitthedd> Ladiva's good because it turns out getting SPD with just a single button is kinda busted
[0:38:40] <%Irridium> ladiva can just run on a train on you and melt 60% of your life off one hit
[0:38:47] <+Dr_DangerPhD> you can choose what level spd you want off of easy input by pressing skill+attack strength as well
[0:39:03] <shitthedd> dont push a button when she has a 100% meter lol
[0:39:13] <%Irridium> also don't jump
[0:39:16] <dinosiurry> Dragon punch input, but whoops, you touched up briefly, now you're just gonna jump instead.

[0:45:52] <Solidnick18> well damn
[0:45:54] <%wujak> hong kong can it it uses p1's language
[0:45:57] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> HK Copy gang

[0:46:02] <%tearfuldevil> ooh a whip
[0:46:10] <BackwardCap> Not on the Japanese version.
[0:46:10] <heartlesshealer> I like how the language is set for each player and not just the host
[0:46:12] <%Exiliator> But muh Doppio!
[0:46:14] <kingkeldeo31> Not in Japan
[0:46:24] <%DensityD> ice car
[0:46:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:46:29] <+ALazo> It's kind of insane how there are no real reasons for the delayed release
[0:46:31] <+DarkNerdShawny> besteban shouldve been first =(
[0:46:40] <shitthedd> It's got the same per player language settings like P4AU
[0:46:41] <Solidnick18> Oh that's tricky
[0:46:43] <+paladinstarbuster> MAH GAD
[0:46:45] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Ferry is a monster on hard knockdown, there's some dirty setups you can do
[0:46:46] <+Epiren> probably just licensing
[0:46:50] <gekizenbu> @ALazo legal red tape is a hell of a drug
[0:46:53] <%Sparkseid> Dodge!
[0:46:55] <TigerClaws12> UNGA
[0:47:15] <heartlesshealer> I never played Arena, so this is new tech to me on the language stuff
[0:47:16] <+AsinPersuasion> Zeta has a counter style reversal on 214
[0:47:20] <Solidnick18> dirty
[0:47:22] <gekizenbu> i mean thebilly and mandy animator didnt know you're notallowed to mix SGA and not SGA actors together so he got legally screwed
[0:47:31] <gekizenbu> media is probably loaded with confusing ass red tape
[0:47:37] <+OhioNitsud> hows the netcode been?
[0:47:41] <+NotHereToStream> instant overhead is too good
[0:47:42] <TigerClaws12> Ass
[0:48:01] <@Solidus_113> we on 3-4 frame delay
[0:48:03] <%Exiliator> Number 248 on Reggie's big list of fetishes: Cat stuff
[0:48:05] <%Sparkseid> it's delay based, so not good
[0:48:14] <+Dr_DangerPhD> if you're waiting in line be sure to move every now and then so you don't get kicked
[0:48:22] <+OhioNitsud> hm :/
[0:48:22] <Lavrohas> does this game not have grabs? that wouldve been a perfect time
[0:48:24] <%TheBesteban> I've been fighting delay 6 Ferry's in these streets
[0:48:29] <+DarkNerdShawny> ggs Kamano
[0:48:30] <TigerClaws12> just call delay based what it is: bad
[0:48:32] <$razielhex> OOF
[0:48:35] <gekizenbu> there's universal airgrabs in this game
[0:48:42] <Thunderhog> The game has grabs, just that they're pretty punishable
[0:48:48] <TaylorTot> ferry's jump c gives me diabetes
[0:48:48] <Lavrohas> ah ok
[0:48:48] <%Wool> SETS
[0:48:51] <@Solidus_113> Remember UNICLR and Indie Pogo

[0:51:24] <Razaku_> yoo Im so hyped for this game. It will be my first FG that I play for more than an hour. Cant wait for the NA release
[0:51:26] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus you cant do english in the JP version
[0:51:27] <itsgutsnotgatsu> ex bambi
[0:51:34] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you don't have english options in the Japanese release, only in the HK verson
[0:51:36] <velozity> yeah the english setting's there you just gotta pay 60 dollars for the game again
[0:51:46] <TigerClaws12> or singapore
[0:51:47] <dinosiurry> The real trick for me is finding a fighting game that my friends like playing too
[0:51:47] <raveous> that's fucked
[0:51:53] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Do you know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode?
[0:51:54] <%alrobot2014> this line is gettin CURAAAZY
[0:51:55] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus you can hit L1 to fast switch
[0:51:56] <dinosiurry> Most recently that game for us was UNIEL
[0:51:57] <kingkeldeo31> Would you smooch a ghost? Heck yeah, Heck yeah, or Heck yeah.
[0:51:59] <heartlesshealer> Languages are Region-Release Locked
[0:52:01] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus Press L1 for quick character change
[0:52:21] <Lavrohas> if theyre in the game why lock that lol
[0:52:23] <SkreamnRedSkull> @IndoorSitup why do you keep asking that?
[0:52:25] <kuitlapiltsontli> My friends still want to play smash and my town doesn't have locals....
[0:52:32] <Thunderhog> You can go into a empty lobby
[0:52:32] <+AsinPersuasion> Reggie 214 is a armor stance
[0:52:37] <Solidnick18> just go to an empty one
[0:52:38] <0rond> I have fallen, and I cannot get up
[0:52:40] <dinosiurry> I just hope I don't gotta pay full price for UNIEST if I have UNIEL, because I mean
[0:52:42] <@Solidus_113> you can do private, but it requires a code system
[0:52:57] <%Wool> you can just set a room to 2 people
[0:52:59] <gekizenbu> UNICLR is going to be a dlc addon for UNIST
[0:53:00] <TaylorTot> I was first in line! boo
[0:53:00] <dinosiurry> It's like two-three new characters and otherwise the same, as far as I can tell
[0:53:01] <Dutchpotato> Mixed in with the riff raff DansGame
[0:53:03] <gekizenbu> thankfully
[0:53:09] <itsgutsnotgatsu> private lobbies are max 8 people
[0:53:11] <dinosiurry> Okay yeah, that's a definite thankfully

[0:56:10] <CalderGaming> @Lavrohas stuffing someone else's move means throwing out a faster move than their move to hit them during their startup, stopping their move

[0:56:11] <%TheBesteban> Trying to do it in delay 5 - 6 is another story
[0:56:26] <+ALazo> oh, did reggie miss the video?
[0:56:28] <dinosiurry> It makes Lowain look like a complete baka gaijin

[1:12:01] <dinosiurry> Seems like every two minutes you gotta ask Woolie if he knows about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode
[1:12:02] <%TheBesteban> @WoolieVersus You play like your house is on fire and you're trying to get one more set in before the roof collapses. Gotta slow down haha

[1:16:40] <Triplicat> the SA will work
[1:16:40] <+TheEmoFish> ooooof
[1:16:48] <ikantreeed> i find the anime kinda boring tho
[1:16:59] <rad_dude123465> The other super would have worked
[1:17:00] <ikantreeed> watched 6-7 episode and its meh
[1:17:03] <shitthedd> the other super is the one that mightve worked
[1:17:04] <houtenhen> because the anime cover the earliest part of granblue which is boring
[1:17:06] <OkamiDude15> lvl 1 super is a stinger
[1:17:25] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Zeta can activate super in the air as a divekick as well
[1:17:30] <houtenhen> the story get much interesting on arc 2 (which mobile game only)
[1:17:31] <ikantreeed> @houtenhen it was super generic imo. and the main dude is so plain

[1:17:50] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Yeah, so you just happen to be on the Bo5 cab
[1:17:50] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> NotLikeThis
[1:17:51] <kuitlapiltsontli> Don't watch the anime, it barely covers 50% of the first arc and it never even got into the good stuff with Akasha and shit
[1:17:54] <Solidnick18> oh well
[1:18:03] <+DarkNerdShawny> Stealing games. BAN HIM!
[1:18:14] <Triplicat> uh.... move to a different cab tbh
[1:18:20] <Thunderhog> But then the line doh
[1:18:26] <ikantreeed> i generally root for regge but...
[1:18:27] <+DarkNerdShawny> thatll mess up our line
[1:18:27] <Thunderhog> It's a bit complcated cause of that
[1:18:28] <TaylorTot> it was an accident sorry
[1:18:32] <@Solidus_113> Neither of them picked quit, it doesn't have anything to do with the cab
[1:18:33] <ikantreeed> i need that kith boi
[1:18:38] <Thunderhog> And we got a whole Whey train going too
[1:18:40] <+NarcissistCactus> just walk in a line to a different cab atpRtsd
[1:18:42] <%yeknomlive> what ch does the story get good? I've been playing off and on but only on like ch 4
[1:18:43] <shitthedd> but this cab got the atmosphere . like its on the bow and shit
[1:18:54] <concretenj> Zeta fireball beats or trades with Metera's
[1:18:56] <%Irridium> Lowain train in the lobby. Kings.
[1:19:09] <+DarkNerdShawny> Lowain running a train in the lobby
[1:19:12] <+DarkNerdShawny> i mean wut
[1:19:15] <+KettleDood> lytDORF lowain train
[1:19:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> With Kat's spear charge special you can change directions with each one, on ex you get 3
[1:19:19] <dinosiurry> Even knowing nothing about this game, I can feel all of the combos that Reggie is missing
[1:19:21] <%Exiliator> woolieREGGIEFUL Gameplay = none
[1:19:23] <TaylorTot> i really didnt mean to rematch sorry i tried to unconfirm
[1:19:24] <%Exiliator> *plan

[1:19:30] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Yo, do you know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode?
[1:19:38] <ikantreeed> wool did to many push ups and died
[1:19:39] <%Exiliator> gameplay there is tons of
[1:19:51] <@Solidus_113> buttons
[1:19:51] <arkv01> @OkamiDude15 we all do, but cygames a bunch of cowards
[1:19:52] <TigerClaws12> also toe tap pressure
[1:19:53] <%yeknomlive> most of Zetas combos are I corner off anti air
[1:20:06] <%yeknomlive> in corner or antiair*
[1:20:09] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you didn't change buttons
[1:20:12] <TigerClaws12> uh buttons
[1:20:17] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus buttons
[1:20:18] <%Irridium> LUL

[1:20:21] <rad_dude123465> Lowain train in the lobby but catch me out here doing push ups
[1:20:22] <+DarkNerdShawny> Wooliz the buttons!
[1:20:22] <kuitlapiltsontli> @yeknomlive For me it was when they reached Mephorash, but the first arc isn't that great, only the ending is good for me. Arc 2 is when the really cool shit starts.

[1:20:42] <+Dr_DangerPhD> pretty much all of your combo extensions are off of ex moves
[1:20:43] <%Exiliator> So zeta slow!
[1:20:47] <%yeknomlive> @kuitlapiltsontli thanks I'll power through
[1:20:59] <Thunderhog> Handicapped woolie

[1:21:12] <+ALazo> unique
[1:21:12] <%yeknomlive> zeta looking like madoka
[1:21:12] <OkamiDude15> its mashing X
[1:21:12] <Thunderhog> It's just U
[1:21:24] <%Sparkseid> it's the unique button
[1:21:34] <Thunderhog> Oh god wait, did you not know theres a 4th button?
[1:21:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:21:51] <kuitlapiltsontli> @yeknomlive You got a long way if you are in ch4 hahaha, but hope you enjoy the ride, also check out the What Makes the Sky Blue events in the side stories, those are lore heavy for the game and its the base for GBVS story
[1:21:52] <%Wool> oh I just noticed Reggie never used the U button lmao
[1:22:05] <shitthedd> most of the combo theory is just button>button>button>special at mid screen, then using your characters wallbounce EX to extend corner combos
[1:22:19] <ikantreeed> is ayone in the chat playin daemon x machina
[1:22:20] <kuitlapiltsontli> @yeknomlive WMTSB III will probably be reruned next month
[1:22:37] <+Dr_DangerPhD> there's some goofy stuff you can get off of anti air, especially 2h
[1:22:45] <IndoorSitup> KEEP AN EYE ON CHAT LOL
[1:22:52] <arkv01> @IndoorSitup can you not
[1:22:54] <%yeknomlive> that's all she has midscreen ground
[1:22:58] <itsgutsnotgatsu> zeta has some neat AA combos
[1:23:07] <+ALazo> I think that ex dash combo leads to safe jumps
[1:23:11] <itsgutsnotgatsu> if you aa with diagonal beast cannon
[1:23:20] <+Koover> if you hit r2 you can swing the camera around
[1:23:25] <@chesterr01> @wool no idea what I'm doing with zeta
[1:23:43] <shitthedd> she can use down beast cannon as a psuedo-fast fall to get some funky combo extensions in the corner
[1:23:47] <%Sparkseid> Pick Gran
[1:23:47] <OkamiDude15> you just gotta hit the lab for sure
[1:23:49] <itsgutsnotgatsu> zeta seems like one of the harder characters atm
[1:23:54] <+paladinstarbuster> Zeta is good
[1:23:54] <@Solidus_113> Katalina time. She's your shoto
[1:23:59] <Thunderhog> @chesterr01 Real talk, have you used the pogo stick at all?
[1:24:02] <+DarkNerdShawny> dont give up Reggie
[1:24:05] <itsgutsnotgatsu> reggie you should try some zeta pogo set ups
[1:24:05] <+ALazo> ye, pick gran. Do the boot
[1:24:06] <+DarkNerdShawny> you can do it!
[1:24:07] <%yeknomlive> get them in the corner
[1:24:08] <Thunderhog> Cause you haven't used a whole button all your fights
[1:24:20] <OkamiDude15> took me like a couple hours online to learn her stuff reggie

[1:24:48] <IndoorSitup> @chesterr01 Yo, do you two know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode?
[1:24:49] <itsgutsnotgatsu> her j.U (x button) is like Chun Li's stool hop
[1:24:57] <arkv01> reggie hasn't had a chance to touch this since the last grubble stream
[1:24:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> nice super
[1:25:01] <+NotHereToStream> oh right his super is super safe
[1:25:03] <%yeknomlive> zeta beaaamu.
[1:25:10] <%Wool> @chesterr01 if you wanna spend like 10 minutes later to go through the Missions, it might help you a bit
[1:25:29] <itsgutsnotgatsu> so Zeta can do some kinda nutty stuff on block. especially with her 214AC to put her in the air
[1:25:33] <%Irridium> @chesterr01 missions also have match-up tutorials which are real helpful
[1:25:45] <@chesterr01> @wool it's usually what I do with every game I play. I haven't played this outside of the stream yet
[1:25:46] <+paladinstarbuster> see that cool shit
[1:25:46] <%Wool> @Irridium not helpful since they can't read Japanese lmao
[1:25:48] <+neuwaive> what is that mashing that woolie keeps whiffing after the projectile?
[1:25:50] <Thunderhog> Probably be easier once they can read in english
[1:25:54] <%Irridium> oh. right. japanese version LUL
[1:26:07] <arkv01> zeta chads PogChamp
[1:26:09] <IndoorSitup> @chesterr01 Yo, do you two know about the "Original Costumes" option that you unlock by beating the RPG mode?
[1:26:13] <+DarkNerdShawny> ggs
[1:26:15] <%yeknomlive> 214 ac only combos off c I think
[1:26:22] <@Solidus_113> @IndoorSitup you can really stop spamming that now
[1:26:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is this arcade or online?
[1:26:31] <OkamiDude15> online
[1:26:32] <kuitlapiltsontli> Online
[1:26:35] <itsgutsnotgatsu> 214AC can be used for oki as a set up
[1:26:42] <%yeknomlive> ok
[1:26:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Has he cried about the netcode yet?
[1:26:57] <OkamiDude15> nope
[1:27:01] <%Wool> he's not Max
[1:27:03] <OkamiDude15> at least i havent heard it
[1:27:04] <Triplicat> nothing much to say about it past what's already been said
[1:27:08] <arkv01> there's PJSalt in my wifi LUL
[1:27:11] <+Dr_DangerPhD> full screen run up grab, works every time
[1:27:11] <kuitlapiltsontli> Delay 2 online, so not really
[1:27:38] <+NotHereToStream> run up grab is good for conditioning people
[1:27:38] <@Solidus_113> pogo
[1:27:44] <OkamiDude15> you get 3 of those reggie
[1:27:47] <Triplicat> he's also clearly been playing against east coast so it's "fine"
[1:28:03] <+paladinstarbuster> sweeped
[1:28:04] <dinosiurry> Had to step away for a second, what have I missed? How many games has Woolie lost?
[1:28:04] <Triplicat> if someone west coast NA shows up maybe we'll see something funky
[1:28:16] <IndoorSitup> @solidus_113 I don't think I'm spamming but ok ill stop, Id just alpreciate if they read chat more often
[1:28:22] <KalmVibrations> That'd be me, if I can make it through this line in time
[1:28:27] <%Irridium> hope someone from the UK shows up
[1:28:30] <KalmVibrations> Well, not west coast
[1:28:31] <%Wool> @Triplicat I can confirm there is someone in this line that's from Filand and the UK
[1:28:31] <%Irridium> or anywhere in europe
[1:28:33] <KalmVibrations> From Finland
[1:28:43] <Triplicat> yo even better LUL
[1:28:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:28:46] <%Irridium> Finland works
[1:29:02] <@Solidus_113> @IndoorSitup Just because they don't reply doesn't mean they don't see it. This is a stream to play the game online against fans and friends, not to play the single player
[1:29:03] <+R_BChe> Reggie is downloading the files in his brain as we speak
[1:29:08] <arkv01> oh man we gonna get some good jank once euro matches start
[1:29:09] <dinosiurry> I don't think I've seen anyone use the roll skill all night, either on Woolz' end or on the other side of online.
[1:29:10] <Triplicat> I sincerely hope you get to play
[1:29:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> ggs!
[1:29:13] <itsgutsnotgatsu> kalm gonna put the fear of delay based god in you
[1:29:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dabbed On

[1:29:32] <%Wool> The D
[1:29:46] <itsgutsnotgatsu> tbh ive played kalm in Sam Sho and his connection is better than people I've played in the states
[1:29:55] <IndoorSitup> @solidus_113 How do you know for sure they've seen my question? You a mind reader?
[1:30:00] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Solidus_113 At least you cleared up what Woolie's doing. :) Here I thought he might be doing RPG Mode. And he's actually playing it in Japanese too. XD WOW.
[1:30:01] <arkv01> so thats the power of euro fiber huh...
[1:30:04] <%yeknomlive> used her d got in there
[1:30:08] <OkamiDude15> pogo is D, armor is tatsu
[1:30:09] <KalmVibrations> Finland has good internet
[1:30:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Look at these men trying to fool us into believing they can read Kanji Kappa
[1:30:27] <KalmVibrations> Though yeah, there'll still be quite a lot due to the distance
[1:30:30] <itsgutsnotgatsu> i live in florida for clarification
[1:30:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> I wont fall for it woolie
[1:30:36] <KalmVibrations> Speed of light and all that
[1:30:36] <@Solidus_113> @IndoorSitup It's been said before in previous streams, they can see all of the chat, it's not going so fast they can't read
[1:30:45] <%FenixSeraph> so Zetta slow
[1:30:54] <%Wool> Kalm's Internet sucks
[1:30:55] <arkv01> @IndoorSitup sure no one likes to think they're being a bother but dude you clearly need to reevaluate your behaviour
[1:31:00] <%Wool> He's unplayable
[1:31:02] <Nekros4442> From what i've played, Zeta is definitley the weakest on the roster
[1:31:07] <itsgutsnotgatsu> wool why you put kalm on your blocklist
[1:31:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Bring back child decapitationz in Gundam
[1:31:13] <itsgutsnotgatsu> Thats kinda racist tbh
[1:31:18] <KalmVibrations> Because Wool's afraid
[1:31:20] <IndoorSitup> @solidus_113 Doesn t mean theyre always looking at it
[1:31:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shitty kids need to learn the hard way
[1:31:34] <masque_de> Factoring hectopascals!
[1:31:34] <Triplicat> @WoolieVersus not that it matters against zeta so much if you guys keep fighting zetas but EX rekka in the corner gets you a safejump if you superjump
[1:31:36] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Nekros4442 Who would you say is what you would go with most of all?
[1:31:37] <arkv01> wool can't deal with a connection two oceans away LUL
[1:31:37] <@Solidus_113> Just stop dude, it's not hard
[1:31:38] <dinosiurry> I laugh every time I hear one fighter use english voice and the other use japanese
[1:31:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh fuck off mirror match
[1:31:41] <%Wool> @IndoorSitup If you want them to see your message, try subscribing or donating!
[1:31:43] <%FenixSeraph> Teh Rin is not the best VA
[1:31:47] <IndoorSitup> @solidus_113 I did.
[1:31:49] <itsgutsnotgatsu> wool called his ISP and specifically told them to block Kalm's connection
[1:31:56] <Nekros4442> @Bryon_Youngblood Who I play? I play Zeta.
[1:32:03] <@Solidus_113> And anyways, where's the point in unlocking things for the JP release when they'll have to do it again for english
[1:32:05] <kuitlapiltsontli> You can clearly see the superiority of JP Zeta to the Eng one
[1:32:07] <Nekros4442> @Bryon_Youngblood But that's the waifu factor in play
[1:32:24] <CountMeowingtonn> i so desperately want to play this game, fucking shit ass publisher delaying the game for no reason in the west FeelsBadMan
[1:32:25] <IndoorSitup> @wool Living in a shit part of the US isn't easy
[1:32:27] <arkv01> yeah I don't think they want to spoil the RPG mode experience with the language barrier
[1:32:37] <+Koover> how many overheads you go
[1:32:38] <%Irridium> got that shovel knight tech
[1:32:42] <+Koover> "yes"
[1:32:48] <Bryon_Youngblood> XD Hey, I think for people who know GBF may go for the waifu factor for some characters, @Nekros4442
[1:32:55] <%Exiliator> Excellent! :)
[1:33:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> I see nerd has brouggt the gyaru
[1:33:05] <Nekros4442> did they actually localize the "push harder" moment of Zeta as fucking "Furious Roar"?
[1:33:09] <kuitlapiltsontli> @CountMeowingtonn You could have bought the asian verision, sell the codes to get atleast 50 dollars back and the buy the eng version
[1:33:10] <Nekros4442> That's terrible
[1:33:13] <Bryon_Youngblood> Here comes Zeta's SSBA!
[1:33:14] <Thunderhog> You can double pogo into jb
[1:33:18] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> just chun li mix em
[1:33:20] <IndoorSitup> Well, Woolie did say earlier that he's been trying to unlock new colors for Lancelot.
[1:33:29] <arkv01> patrician taste, nerdshawny
[1:33:30] <@Solidus_113> Next player better be a Vasaraga
[1:33:31] <Zerotoad5> just use the sharingan reggie
[1:33:39] <CountMeowingtonn> @kuitlapiltsontli giving them over a hundred dollars is real cringe
[1:33:49] <velozity> sirius roar is the name of her attack
[1:33:50] <OkamiDude15> @Nekros4442 naw she just says the name listed on the movelist sirious roar
[1:33:51] <shitthedd> DLC rackam is mandatory . i want to see duration dance as his ssba

[1:34:32] <itsgutsnotgatsu> yea
[1:34:32] <+hoenhime344> capt jack rackem
[1:34:33] <raveous> I think YOU'RE the fake hedgehog around here!
[1:34:34] <nothuzad> some ar good some are "eh"
[1:34:41] <itsgutsnotgatsu> dash dodge is real
[1:34:42] <masque_de> Englsih VA are straight 4 kids tier
[1:34:43] <OkamiDude15> zeta and percivals eng va arent too hot imo
[1:34:44] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @ALazo yes, it's instant as well
[1:34:46] <+Jaysky> You're comparing yourself to me? HA.
[1:34:50] <OkamiDude15> the rest are alright
[1:34:51] <gordieda20> All that matters is Eng Lowain
[1:34:53] <%Irridium> Katalina's are fine, which works for me.
[1:34:55] <arkv01> GIT EM
[1:34:59] <CountMeowingtonn> ROASTED
[1:35:01] <@Solidus_113> Ladiva and Lowain are good in English
[1:35:05] <+Jaysky> Dabbed on
[1:35:06] <masque_de> Eng lowain is the exception, he's perfect
[1:35:07] <+paladinstarbuster> niceu
[1:35:10] <itsgutsnotgatsu> see but english katalina replaces Miyuki Sawashiro so she sucks
[1:35:15] <+neuwaive> reggie why you using the projectile at close range, doesn't seem plus on hit
[1:35:19] <%Irridium> true
[1:35:19] <ZeterZero > These matches fast.
[1:35:23] <CountMeowingtonn> Zettas english VA is pretty..... hmmmmm......
[1:35:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Evo this year is gonna be good
[1:35:29] <Bryon_Youngblood> I think the English voices aren't that bad really. I honestly was surprised to hear Zeta is voiced by Mela Lee, since I'm more used to her as Rachel from BlazBlue than some of her other roles. XD
[1:35:29] <%Wool> the only good English voices are ProZD and Lowain, don't @ me
[1:35:41] <@Solidus_113> ProZD is Vasaraga
[1:35:43] <+Jaysky> @Wool
[1:35:51] <masque_de> Yo what, it's the same as Rachel?
[1:35:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[1:35:51] <gordieda20> @wool
[1:35:55] <itsgutsnotgatsu> english gran and lyria are aight. cause theyre literally 9S and 2B
[1:35:58] <Bryon_Youngblood> Patrick Seitz is also good as Ladiva, even if I imagine some of his other characters would be like "What the fuck?!" if they saw Ladvia XD
[1:36:02] <shitthedd> ProZD Vas is pretty good. I feel like he sounds more like an old man tho
[1:36:06] <KalmVibrations> @Wool
[1:36:09] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> I think 9S is fine as Gran
[1:36:13] <+ALazo> no, don't do them, be stronk
[1:36:23] <kurdlez> doesnt the cooldown affect the oki as well
[1:36:26] <kurdlez> i know it affects the super
[1:36:32] <IndoorSitup> Honestly this really is the type of game where you play with JP voices only 'cause theyve got some fucking LEGENDS to voice these characters in Japan
[1:36:33] <+RichardMF_> @woolieversus shortcuts do affect damage scaling and oki
[1:36:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Reminder that canonically. 9S got into that ass.
[1:36:45] <itsgutsnotgatsu> yea the jpn cast is mad stacked
[1:36:46] <shitthedd> Eng Gran and Kat are is also Alm and Celica
[1:36:47] <CountMeowingtonn> yare yare daze
[1:36:48] <+DarkNerdShawny> gg reggie!
[1:36:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> 9S did it!
[1:36:54] <Nekros4442> Yeah, Granblue has the full A-list of voice actors
[1:36:59] <Nekros4442> In Japan ;p
[1:37:06] <Bryon_Youngblood> Well, some of them in English are up there too.
[1:37:08] <masque_de> Thing is, you change the voice and it affects the person on the other end too LUL
[1:37:11] <+Koover> I wanna say your positioning is slightly different if you use the shortcuts
[1:37:14] <kuitlapiltsontli> Sad that Korwa VA retired tho
[1:37:15] <itsgutsnotgatsu> jpn lyria is Nao Toyama. whose in a bunch of shit and shes fantastic
[1:37:29] <Bryon_Youngblood> @masque_de Kinda reminds me of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and UMVC3 with the voice settings for the Capcom cast.
[1:37:43] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> on some moves, damage is nerfed
[1:37:53] <CountMeowingtonn> which SF did they say they were inspired by? i forget
[1:37:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> Somebody is getting fucked
[1:37:58] <masque_de> 2
[1:37:58] <%Irridium> we should all just do Tekken and have people speak their native language. Monster Hunter should have talked in monster hunter language in MvC Infinite
[1:37:59] <OkamiDude15> i think 2
[1:38:00] <+Jaysky> enD oF ThE lINe
[1:38:03] <arkv01> eyyy
[1:38:04] <Thunderhog> For the record, auto combo actually scales your damage in the long run
[1:38:09] <IndoorSitup> Yeah I really wish there was an option to keep the Japanese voices despite what the other person has it set as
[1:38:09] <+DarkNerdShawny> gg Reggie!!!!!!! =D
[1:38:11] <+Sunthiel> that eat this line doesnt sound very good lol
[1:38:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Gyaru eliminate
[1:38:19] <itsgutsnotgatsu> 3rd hit of autocombo scales
[1:38:28] <itsgutsnotgatsu> proration starts on 3rd hit

[1:39:11] <@Solidus_113> reading is hard

[1:42:00] <Bryon_Youngblood> @sonofthedeepsouth Hate to break it to you, but Charlotta's in her 20's. :) Her race is just typically very short, even if she wants to be taller.
[1:42:01] <OkamiDude15> metera's got bison slide but thats about it
[1:42:11] <Solidnick18> shit
[1:42:11] <+DarkNerdShawny> @arkv01 dont question it or itll start to make sense, i want it this way
[1:42:15] <KalmVibrations> It hits up and down, but it only has invuls going upwards
[1:42:18] <gordieda20> chopped
[1:42:19] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Irridium I'd like to see Cabba as a possibility if we got Kefla, maybe some others from the Tournament of Power.
[1:42:30] <Solidnick18> you just gotta believe woolz
[1:42:33] <shitthedd> as a doppo shitter, i think DBFZ is lacking in fat bastards

[1:42:43] <%yeknomlive> charlotta ending you get to see her fantasy height
[1:42:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> @bryon_youngblood I meantvthe player actually. But its good to know
[1:42:56] <Thunderhog> Despite her size, her CROWN is part of her hurt box
[1:42:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:42:58] <arkv01> @yeknomlive 50 feet giantress

[1:56:01] <itsgutsnotgatsu> plus after SPD, headbut is plus, has a projectile invul move
[1:56:08] <rad_dude123465> Also I just got the game a couple days ago so I’m sorta trash but ladiva is my best
[1:56:13] <@Solidus_113> 6 frame
[1:56:14] <+fizzguy47> bring Lord JimmyBones in for Glory
[1:56:18] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> Vas gang
[1:56:21] <shitthedd> the fact that ladiva's forward throw leaves her at +12 is so funny, like. good luck
[1:56:30] <+ALazo> everyone forgets the third hit
[1:56:38] <arkv01> the third swallow
[1:56:43] <%Exiliator> woolieREMEMBERS Reggie...
[1:56:51] <Bryon_Youngblood> I saw a video on YouTube someone did for Lowain on how to deal with Yggdrasil when she's called out.
[1:56:53] <+neuwaive> reggie stopped the dash
[1:57:14] <Thunderhog> @Wool Guess im going vas, but expect me to get stuffed by woolie
[1:57:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[1:57:16] <rad_dude123465> @bryon_youngblood even then it still super difficult if the lowain knows what they’re doing
[1:57:18] <IndoorSitup> WHAT?
[1:57:22] <TigerClaws12> scaling is so fucked LUL
[1:57:26] <%Exiliator> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[1:57:31] <%Exiliator> awww
[1:57:33] <%Irridium> ggs LUL
[1:57:34] <marcelmonke> reggie comeback
[1:57:36] <%yeknomlive> well
[1:57:44] <marcelmonke> oh
[1:57:45] <Hentailovr> what was that random EX that came nowhere close?
[1:57:45] <CountMeowingtonn> Kat just fucked em hard BibleThump
[1:57:53] <+ALazo> Do not EX zeta's beam
[1:57:58] <+solzan2000> ex works like mk11 here
[1:57:58] <+Koover> yeah the cooldowns aren't nearly that bad
[1:58:04] <IndoorSitup> "I will fucking laser you." -- Kanye West
[1:58:05] <%yeknomlive> Zetas beam is for corner combos
[1:58:07] <rad_dude123465> Wish me luck y’all
[1:58:08] <+solzan2000> it recharges
[1:58:14] <+Koover> I had to get over fear of the cooldown
[1:58:14] <IndoorSitup> LAND THAT PIN
[1:58:16] <@Solidus_113> Save us Ladiva
[1:58:17] <%yeknomlive> ex*
[1:58:21] <shitthedd> most of the time if you use an EX in combos you'll have it nearly back by the time the combos over
[1:58:22] <%Irridium> also how about that delay-based netcode huh
[1:58:26] <CountMeowingtonn> Indeed this is a good game :)
[1:58:27] <+ALazo> spam small beams, save ex beams for corner combos
[1:58:27] <+neuwaive> ex is just a heavy in this game
[1:58:36] <shitthedd> also moves cooldown during cutscene supers too
[1:58:42] <TigerClaws12> lol that box emote
[1:58:47] <%Exiliator> I like the box
[1:58:54] <+Dr_DangerPhD> ex moves are where all your combo extensions/wall bounces are
[1:58:58] <stormydaysz> as a moba player , cooldowns are not a free resource , but do use them in good opportunities
[1:59:03] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> ex beam is best in combos. it has a close hit box on start up and it wall bounces in corner
[1:59:13] <OkamiDude15> "why is charlotta on the box?" "she likes being tall."
[1:59:20] <arkv01> in this episode of GIFG, do button setups kill friendships PunOko

[2:02:25] <Thunderhog> You got good ass buttons man

[2:03:04] <Thunderhog> @Ghostfaceninja53534 General conesnsus is gran, kat, ferry, and carlotta
[2:03:06] <%yeknomlive> gran char ferry
[2:03:06] <OkamiDude15> top tiers are charlotta, metera and lowain i think
[2:03:08] <+wjones0415> damn! throw invulnerability is the truth!
[2:03:09] <IndoorSitup> AWAKENED
[2:03:09] <%jiggy_snipe> there we go
[2:03:11] <EndgameContent> Ladiva woke the FUCK up
[2:03:16] <+Dr_DangerPhD> [download complete]
[2:03:31] <Thunderhog> @OkamiDude15 Lowain is dropping a lot cause people are realizing all his stuff is super fake
[2:03:41] <Thunderhog> Even i know my shits fake
[2:03:43] <OkamiDude15> yeah i assumed as much
[2:03:46] <+ghostfaceninja_> the number of names is encouraging
[2:03:58] <duffydirty> Ladiva 1st set: I sleep 2nd set: REAL SHIT?
[2:04:09] <OkamiDude15> ooh

[2:04:43] <Thunderhog> @Nekros4442 Oh, he still blows up scrubs. Once you get to like A rank on ranked in this game, everyone knows to never respect lowain
[2:04:51] <zekana> tier list as far as tournaments go are Gran, Katalina, metera, and ferry it seems
[2:04:54] <Thunderhog> You challenge anything lowain does and he crumbles
[2:04:59] <KalmVibrations> Metera's dropping off
[2:05:02] <IndoorSitup> Man, seeing people react to these characters for the first time has been great
[2:05:08] <Bryon_Youngblood> From what I've heard, Ferry can do some crazy stuff with her range and whip
[2:05:13] <KalmVibrations> And people are starting to realize that Lancelot can be stupid unga
[2:05:13] <rad_dude123465> Damn I didn’t do the cool thing :(

[2:16:39] <nothuzad> well in thi case its more CyGamesfault for not picking up teh slack
[2:16:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> i bought and have been playing uniclr
[2:16:42] <Thunderhog> Xseed constantly delays english localisations
[2:16:44] <Sol_Install> they always do this
[2:16:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> i still suck at this
[2:16:46] <IndoorSitup> @yeknomlive God I hope not

[2:17:20] <nothuzad> CyGames easily could have handled internal translations - they have infinite money but they didnt :)
[2:17:21] <kuitlapiltsontli> I think its more about licensing issues, Granblue is a licensing nightmare due to all the collabs

[2:40:17] <dinosiurry> I just remembered some /v/ story about a guy who was trying to emulate a DS internet browser game to use the internet
[2:40:18] <itsgutsnotgatsu> or is he on ranked
[2:40:20] <@Solidus_113> No code, just room name
[2:40:21] <shitthedd> londrekia wife posters out here already
[2:40:28] <itsgutsnotgatsu> whats room
[2:40:29] <%TheBesteban> If you dig this game and want to learn more about it, I did a documentary on UNI. You can find it by searching "Long Live the Night" on Youtube
[2:40:32] <@Solidus_113> WoolieVersus
[2:40:54] <%Irridium> if you're looking now it won't show up because he's in a game. gotta get lucky when searching when it's over
[2:41:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> i think LTG is online
[2:41:02] <+RealPT1> you can back airdash now and press buttons on the way down
[2:41:05] <Nekros4442> I wouldnt worry about explaining the grid ;p
[2:41:08] <Nekros4442> lol
[2:41:25] <dinosiurry> If I had any faith in my skill, I'd try out my Hilda
[2:41:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus why don't you go play LowtierFraud, who i think is ltg
[2:41:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> if not it's hilarious
[2:42:01] <+ALazo> You get a roman cancel once in a while, essentially
[2:42:06] <killaholic89> just start with Gordeau of you're not sure who to try
[2:42:13] <Solidnick18> Skreeeeeeeeeeeaw
[2:42:15] <$Noponiz> basically he gets a roman cancel with some meter gain to it
[2:42:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> i am
[2:42:34] <itsgutsnotgatsu> its me
[2:42:40] <Nekros4442> Good offense and very good defense is how you generate the grd meter btw
[2:42:41] <$Noponiz> plus a character specific buff and some damage buff while he doesnt use it
[2:42:44] <+RealPT1> vorpal gives a character specific buff and turns grid to meter when canceled
[2:42:44] <dinosiurry> I mean, I know I'm a Hilda main
[2:42:48] <itsgutsnotgatsu> im banging on the foot
[2:42:49] <JustABaconStrip> that banner KappaPride
[2:42:50] <dinosiurry> I just also know I'm not good at it
[2:43:01] <dinosiurry> Not on a real competitive level
[2:43:04] <Triplicat> UNIEL was ok
[2:43:13] <Triplicat> UNIB was b a d
[2:43:16] <itsgutsnotgatsu> uniel more like A Assimilation
[2:43:18] <knight_of_the_edge> hey whats the story of this game???
[2:43:38] <Nekros4442> @knight_of_the_edge anime bullshit
[2:43:43] <%Broand> that's a very long answer
[2:43:44] <Nekros4442> pretty much lol
[2:43:55] <niishucks> Gangwars and anime vampires
[2:43:55] <JustABaconStrip> not just any anime bullshit
[2:43:58] <JustABaconStrip> hype anime bullshit
[2:44:00] <$Noponiz> basically kiiiinda similar world to p3
[2:44:04] <+Koover> not seeing the room
[2:44:06] <ikantreeed> what's the netcode on this game?
[2:44:13] <JustABaconStrip> delay pretty sure
[2:44:14] <+ALazo> delayed
[2:44:14] <$Noponiz> specifically the midnight hour
[2:44:18] <itsgutsnotgatsu> delay based
[2:44:23] <killaholic89> young people get super powers from being bit by monsters, but the more they use powers more monsters come
[2:44:30] <JustABaconStrip> its a japanese dev, they're allergic to ggpo
[2:44:32] <ikantreeed> ok thanks
[2:44:33] <dinosiurry> There's a bunch of weird magic zones popping up all over Japan, and they're filled with monsters and magic bullshit that gives people magic powers
[2:44:35] <+RichardMF_> hey it's kula colors on lodreika rn
[2:44:38] <$Noponiz> it's averagely decent anime fighter netcode
[2:44:43] <+LiteSphere9> Not playing the switch version >:(
[2:44:43] <sagat_n33ds_mad_buffs> I just started playing this game and the tutorial is convoluted with information too much useless shit on it.
[2:44:47] <$Noponiz> it's not offensive but not as good as we wish it was
[2:44:48] <+SolidGoldDog> Does this have cross play?
[2:44:54] <NeddTheNerd> REGGIE LET ME HAVE YOUR BABIES AngelThump
[2:44:59] <killaholic89> I didn't notice the Kula colors
[2:45:03] <%Irridium> ...there's a switch version?
[2:45:06] <JustABaconStrip> not as bad as GGXRD but not as good as even SFV
[2:45:09] <%SilverInferno3> Switch mains rise up
[2:45:11] <nothuzad> pro controller exists
[2:45:14] <+LiteSphere9> I got my fightstick modded for switch
[2:45:15] <4skore> play on joy con you coward
[2:45:16] <$Noponiz> the switch has controllers, wtf
[2:45:16] <Solidnick18> their's a switch version?
[2:45:19] <$Noponiz> what kind of take is that
[2:45:25] <dinosiurry> I believe it came out today
[2:45:29] <JustABaconStrip> the pro controller has a scuffed ass dpad
[2:45:35] <itsgutsnotgatsu> all the info in the tutorial is good
[2:45:44] <fgiting> Merk got 22[b]
[2:45:45] <JustABaconStrip> yeah tutorial is amazing
[2:45:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> i missed my window to get in
[2:45:53] <JustABaconStrip> probably best anime fighter tutorial
[2:45:55] <TaylorTot> gentleman my match is what it looks like when you haventy played this in 4 months
[2:45:57] <+NotHereToStream> b tatsu PogChamp
[2:45:59] <ikantreeed> I'm trying to draw something, but i have no ideas...what should i draw guys?
[2:45:59] <$Noponiz> also I am sure you can make sticks work on switch as well as hitboxes
[2:46:02] <fgiting> It makes a single worm go faster and hit more times
[2:46:05] <JustABaconStrip> did someone say CHESTO
[2:46:10] <+LiteSphere9> CHESTO
[2:46:15] <+Moolord> CHESTO
[2:46:16] <%tearfuldevil> SIDE CHESTO?
[2:46:17] <Solidnick18> akatsuki PogChamp
[2:46:21] <Solidnick18> CHESTO
[2:46:24] <itsgutsnotgatsu> b tastu
[2:46:26] <nobody287> CHESTO
[2:46:27] <Fuukataba> CHESTO
[2:46:30] <$Noponiz> akatsuki is a shoto..ofc he plays him woolie
[2:46:33] <JustABaconStrip> B TATSU PogChamp
[2:46:38] <%SilverInferno3> Anyone knows if Woolie said any plans to play DBFZ Season 3?
[2:46:40] <%tearfuldevil> yeah didn't reggie say he dropped phonon at some point?
[2:47:08] <JustABaconStrip> yuzuriha and phonon are my favorite
[2:47:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:47:10] <JustABaconStrip> BIG NORMALS
[2:47:31] <sagat_n33ds_mad_buffs> The tutorial is just full of redundant information, what you need to know about the actual mechanics are about 30 flash cards in
[2:47:39] <JustABaconStrip> ^
[2:47:43] <%SilverInferno3> Woolie with the good takes
[2:47:44] <@Solidus_113> I wanted Filia...
[2:47:48] <JustABaconStrip> after the basics its all character specific
[2:47:57] <+Moolord> they really should get blitz in here
[2:47:58] <%Irridium> so now it's for real right
[2:48:05] <$Noponiz> I mean killing there was ez pz
[2:48:06] <JustABaconStrip> CH-CH-CH-CHESTO
[2:48:31] <antoniojlopezm> Dunno, I really liked that "redundant" information in the tutorial
[2:48:39] <killaholic89> b tatsu is footsies
[2:48:45] <antoniojlopezm> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:48:48] <JustABaconStrip> the redundant stuff is good for fundamentals
[2:48:53] <+paladinstarbuster> Kreygasm
[2:49:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> divide
[2:50:42] <sagat_n33ds_mad_buffs> The mechanics of the game shouldn’t be at the bottom, it’s like I’m taking remedial classes again just because I transferred schools
[2:50:47] <JustABaconStrip> was anyone else surprised when UNICLR got announced for EVO again?
[2:50:55] <sagat_n33ds_mad_buffs> Shits kinda dumb
[2:51:06] <antoniojlopezm> Just... skip to the advanced or veteran brackets then
[2:51:11] <itsgutsnotgatsu> the mechanics are after the fundamental stuff
[2:51:13] <antoniojlopezm> No one forces you to go through the beginner stuff
[2:51:15] <$Noponiz> whenever I put time into Akatsuki I get sidetracked by trying to make super specific, suboptimal combos with as much CHESTO as possible
[2:51:16] <dinosiurry> I mean, I'm happy for them @JustABaconStrip
[2:51:21] <itsgutsnotgatsu> the bottom is all option selects and shit
[2:51:31] <JustABaconStrip> yeah im not complaining, just surprised, game is actually super tight
[2:51:44] <dinosiurry> They made a better game than Mortal Kombat 11 and Smash Bros Melee combined
[2:51:50] <$Noponiz> ok, but some people donmt know what you consider redundant
[2:51:52] <JustABaconStrip> MK11 atpRtsd
[2:52:01] <$Noponiz> should the game scan your brain to know what you know and skip those tutorials?
[2:52:03] <%SilverInferno3> But whens SNK Heroines tho
[2:52:06] <antoniojlopezm> That too, not everyone knows the stuff that's basic for you
[2:52:07] <tacostarvedbeast> anyone knows if woolie has revisited that french bread game gleam of force? would love to see him and reggie dig into that one
[2:52:14] <antoniojlopezm> There's a reason a lot of people praise this game's tutorial
[2:52:19] <@Solidus_113> @tacostarvedbeast they have not
[2:52:25] <BoneBagMel> Reggie "buried it with me"
[2:52:27] <dinosiurry> That's Google's plan for Stadia Negative Latency @Noponiz
[2:52:32] <TigerClaws12> nice parry
[2:52:33] <OkamiDude15> snk heroines is in the bathroom for girls™ like melty blood
[2:52:34] <JustABaconStrip> CHESTO
[2:52:40] <tacostarvedbeast> @Solidus_113 hopefully one day, boxing girl was dope
[2:52:40] <+Koover> ggs
[2:52:49] <JustABaconStrip> SNK heroines is just jerk-off bait
[2:52:55] <JustABaconStrip> change my mind
[2:52:59] <$Noponiz> plus there are a lot of things that could easily go different ways. Reverse beat isn't a given. Many anime fighters only go up for example
[2:53:03] <%Wool> I'M FROM TEXAS
[2:53:04] <sagat_n33ds_mad_buffs> Delay based netcode it’s automatically not better than mk11
[2:53:12] <itsgutsnotgatsu> there are new moves
[2:53:13] <%SilverInferno3> @JustABaconStrip The actual in-game models ain't great
[2:53:15] <JustABaconStrip> netcode doesn't matter in locals
[2:53:22] <itsgutsnotgatsu> linnr has a helm splitter now
[2:53:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, damn wool
[2:53:23] <+Koover> I got too greedy, tried to punish with 6C :(
[2:53:23] <sagat_n33ds_mad_buffs> I don’t even play MK11 though but that’s just facts
[2:53:28] <TigerClaws12> just walk to your locals 4Head
[2:53:30] <%SilverInferno3> Character portraits nice af tho
[2:53:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm trying to get in damnit
[2:53:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's a 1-bar so have fun
[2:53:42] <$Noponiz> Byakuya DansGame
[2:53:45] <itsgutsnotgatsu> im trying so hard to get in
[2:53:46] <JustABaconStrip> MK11 is just too bland, everyone plays their character the same with no variety because it's balanced that way
[2:54:01] <$Noponiz> this song is so sick
[2:54:05] <@Solidus_113> MK11 is a game of heavy zoning
[2:54:07] <OkamiDude15> this song slaps
[2:54:22] <+JohnMarkley> hello everyone :) /
[2:54:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:54:23] <tacostarvedbeast> bakuya cant doesnt have good reversal options if i remember correctly, great at everything else though
[2:54:36] <itsgutsnotgatsu> ex rekka is his reversal
[2:54:37] <Nekros4442> I was sold on Merkava as soon as he kidnapped someone when he won
[2:54:39] <JustABaconStrip> also it has the longtime issue of being really stiff to play and look at
[2:54:40] <killaholic89> wonder if merkava 236C is still +on block
[2:54:45] <zenith0111> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:54:52] <Yomigami> @WoolieVersus from what i've played Undernight just feels like a less Bathroom version of melty blood
[2:54:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @JustABaconStrip i like to play 1 character, and that's shao khan, and boy, it sure is nice having only 1 variation that's playable
[2:55:09] <BackwardCap> LUL
[2:55:10] <%SilverInferno3> CAUGHT
[2:55:11] <zenith0111> MIX UPS
[2:55:13] <Solidnick18> WHAT
[2:55:14] <killaholic89> Scooped
[2:55:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> CAUGHT
[2:55:15] <TigerClaws12> SHOOK
[2:55:20] <SuperFightinRobot> I don't know about that one fam
[2:55:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> GET FUCKED
[2:55:31] <JustABaconStrip> atpRtsd FUCKED
[2:55:34] <$Noponiz> that's like triple fully invincible
[2:55:36] <%Exiliator> woolieSHOOK
[2:55:36] <@Solidus_113> he loves his sister
[2:55:40] <$Noponiz> AND HE DIPS AFTER ONE
[2:55:43] <JustABaconStrip> we know what that means in japan
[2:55:45] <%Wool> ONE AND DONE
[2:55:50] <$Noponiz> LUL
[2:55:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> god damnit
[2:55:53] <$Noponiz> you bastard
[2:56:02] <tacostarvedbeast> he took the points and RAN!
[2:56:06] <%Wool> (i actually didn't know it was sets)
[2:56:09] <+NotHereToStream> Japalabama at it again
[2:56:12] <JustABaconStrip> winquitters smh atpCap
[2:56:15] <itsgutsnotgatsu> @yomigami nah UNI is way more grounded. melty has insane air options and so neutral in that game is almost entirely airborne. whereas uni doesnt even have air blocking
[2:56:16] <zenith0111> Merkava Mirror bl00dyTooLate
[2:56:22] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:56:37] <Dhurkst> Is it just me, or would Merkava fit right in as a DMC enemy?
[2:56:45] <$Noponiz> he would
[2:56:46] <@Solidus_113> Merk is basically berserk Eva 01
[2:56:46] <JustABaconStrip> merkava in eva 3.0+1.0
[2:56:49] <$Noponiz> I am so sad
[2:56:58] <dinosiurry> This is just the Merkava Power Hour
[2:57:00] <tacostarvedbeast> merkava as one of Vs summons sure
[2:57:11] <$Noponiz> I wish I could play, but I am committed to pc on this game
[2:57:15] <JustABaconStrip> REEEEEEEE
[2:57:28] <$Noponiz> Guess I'll keep playing unist until they deem us second rate citizen worthy
[2:57:29] <killaholic89> PC FGC life is sad sometimes
[2:57:32] <officialsammyla> Is Under night a good fighting game to start at if I want to get into fighting games ?
[2:57:36] <itsgutsnotgatsu> no pc for uniclr is sad tbh
[2:57:36] <zenith0111> Gotta get those multi hits
[2:57:38] <JustABaconStrip> on just this game? i only play PC
[2:57:43] <@Solidus_113> @officialsammyla yes
[2:57:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> man there's so many people online tonight for this game
[2:57:52] <JustABaconStrip> but for pc players its atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:57:53] <itsgutsnotgatsu> @officialsammyla sure if it looks cool to you. it's a lot of fun
[2:57:53] <Nekros4442> uhhhh
[2:58:03] <Nekros4442> I wouldnt say it is. Usually you want to start a game when it's new
[2:58:05] <niishucks> 2cc j.Cab j.2c
[2:58:07] <Thunderhog> VORE
[2:58:08] <Solidnick18> OOOOOOOOOO
[2:58:09] <Zerotoad5> Vore
[2:58:09] <zenith0111> DED
[2:58:09] <Dhurkst> DAMN SON
[2:58:11] <Nekros4442> With UNICLR there's a whole lot of killers online already
[2:58:13] <JustABaconStrip> DETH monkaS
[2:58:13] <Solidnick18> Yummy
[2:58:18] <+paladinstarbuster> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[2:58:22] <$Noponiz> dont say the v word
[2:58:24] <gordieda20> DEATH
[2:58:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> let me IIIN
[2:58:33] <zentav> he hungry
[2:58:48] <Dhurkst> hongry boi
[2:58:49] <BackwardCap> SLAP BASE
[2:58:52] <JustABaconStrip> why do japanese devs hate PC so much
[2:58:57] <itsgutsnotgatsu> ive been knocking and knocking and knocking, pounding and knocking, let me iiin
[2:59:02] <JustABaconStrip> no samsho still, it came to fuckin stadia first atpRtsd
[2:59:22] <Dhurkst> @JustABaconStrip indie Japanese don't
[2:59:24] <itsgutsnotgatsu> kaiserwave did say it was getting a proper PC port
[2:59:26] <Nekros4442> @JustABaconStrip PC isnt a big thing in Japan.....mostly a porn game thing there lol
[2:59:27] <$Noponiz> I figured it would be a given that uniclr comes to pc, considering we got unist
[2:59:29] <$Noponiz> but here we are
[2:59:30] <itsgutsnotgatsu> for samsho i mean
[2:59:31] <+Koover> @CaptainPileDriver I think they have the room set to be only 2 people in at a time
[2:59:38] <@Solidus_113> Sam Sho is going to make millions on PC through steam, that's why they didn't take the Epic deal
[2:59:43] <JustABaconStrip> oh trust me i know about hentai games
[2:59:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Koover i know
[3:00:05] <zenith0111> bl00dyTooLate
[3:00:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm just mashing that search again button trying to get in
[3:00:17] <TigerClaws12> "Why sell hundreds of thousands when you can sell MILLIONS?" LUL
[3:00:18] <+Moolord> is there any new characters in this game
[3:00:18] <killaholic89> Unist took six months, I hope Uniclr comes sooner
[3:00:19] <$Noponiz> honestly at this point i call 10000% bullshit on the samsho story
[3:00:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> when they get to the lobby anyways
[3:00:28] <JustABaconStrip> epic atpCap
[3:00:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> what samsho story?
[3:00:42] <$Noponiz> it wasnt that they are confident they would make more money on steam over epic. Google stadia offered even more money than epic probably
[3:00:56] <Nekros4442> That Samsho denied the Epic deal so they c ould sell millions of copies
[3:01:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> i believe them
[3:01:06] <$Noponiz> I'd rather it be on epic exclusively than this shit
[3:01:08] <Nekros4442> Which could still be true....if Google payed them thatm uch
[3:01:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause it's fucking snk, what do they care
[3:01:19] <$Noponiz> then why is it on stadia with not even a confirmation of anything else tho
[3:01:27] <JustABaconStrip> it would be nice if they actually released the fuckin game before it loses too much hype
[3:01:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19

[3:04:21] <zenith0111> Eltnum player... where? Jebaited
[3:04:27] <+ForestEX> BIG
[3:04:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK YOU YOU DO IT
[3:04:29] <%SilverInferno3> JUST
[3:04:29] <+ForestEX> MEATY
[3:04:31] <+ForestEX> CLAWS
[3:04:32] <%SilverInferno3> DO IT
[3:04:34] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:04:41] <@Solidus_113> Give me a PSN trial code and I will
[3:04:44] <JustABaconStrip> getting slammed by those big meaty claws
[3:04:47] <JustABaconStrip> god i wish that were me
[3:04:48] <zenith0111> Phonon is so gooood
[3:04:51] <Nekros4442> WHENS WAGNER
[3:04:59] <$Noponiz> isnt phonon pretty shit to learn the game tho
[3:05:00] <%yeknomlive> here comes XD
[3:05:03] <%tearfuldevil> yeah, i'm like reggie pretty much
[3:05:08] <+cheezy_snackz> same
[3:05:09] <JustABaconStrip> phonon is really good online but not as much offline
[3:05:12] <itsgutsnotgatsu> mika bonks in chat
[3:05:17] <GeltonZ> Man that's my whole problem with this game ;_; It's fun but all the characters are too bland for me. I need MORE anime.
[3:05:18] <tacostarvedbeast> reggie strikes me as a yuzu player
[3:05:19] <%yeknomlive> best theme
[3:05:22] <gordieda20> XD
[3:05:23] <@Solidus_113> XDDDDDD
[3:05:27] <zenith0111> I'm with Reggie
[3:05:28] <Man_in_the_Red> thats crazy woolie
[3:05:28] <Nekros4442> Yeah one of the best themes
[3:05:33] <$Noponiz> XDDD
[3:05:34] <@Menitta> I'm with Woolie
[3:05:35] <+CaptainPyron> That's... SUPER weird.
[3:05:35] <JustABaconStrip> i would main the shit outta yuzuriha, but i prefer to not have carpal tunnel
[3:05:39] <Man_in_the_Red> you dont spend 60 dollars on 1 character
[3:05:43] <+Nathillon> A roster has to be good to play against AND fight imo. One character would have to be absolutely BITCHING to make me play the game.
[3:05:46] <WakeUpThrow> 100% Woolie
[3:05:47] <GeltonZ> @Man_in_the_Red Says you!
[3:05:47] <+CaptainPyron> One or two characters, please.
[3:05:56] <Thunderhog> This is not XD fkoWow
[3:05:56] <+CaptainPyron> Whole cast? Wh-why though?
[3:05:59] <$Noponiz> I am the most brain damaged person because in smash ULTIMATE i only have 1 character I like
[3:06:01] <@Menitta> I actually do spend $60 for Steve Fox
[3:06:05] <Rhinoprotoss> Seems like a waste
[3:06:07] <Man_in_the_Red> @geltonz you also dont spend 60 on 11 characters LUL
[3:06:09] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Sagit is free like this
[3:06:11] <+Moolord> maybe if we're lucky they'll add akihiko
[3:06:15] <tacostarvedbeast> so does that mean u would like DM5 more is it was all nero and just expanding on his skills to the Nth degree?
[3:06:17] <@Solidus_113> Reggie isn't even paying attention
[3:06:21] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie would play a game of Akihiko vs. Akihiko forever Kappa
[3:06:24] <zenith0111> Sagit just bought the game LUL
[3:06:39] <GeltonZ> I'm thinking I might give Mika a chance. She's like...almost anime enough for me.
[3:06:51] <JustABaconStrip> do it
[3:06:51] <@Solidus_113> FREE
[3:06:53] <JustABaconStrip> become xD
[3:06:53] <$Noponiz> that dirty laugh came from the heart

[3:07:12] <+eanscrale> You kinda have to do taht for guilty gear
[3:07:12] <%SilverInferno3> I like Blazblue purely for Susanoo and Mai
[3:07:13] <@Solidus_113> I don't have online bro

[3:07:56] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Nekros4442
[3:08:01] <JustABaconStrip> i want wagner to step on me
[3:08:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> i got something in
[3:08:03] <Solidnick18> Wagner Kreygasm
[3:08:17] <dj_jellocups> 6k throw baby
[3:08:18] <$Noponiz> reggie probably loves wagner
[3:08:21] <$Noponiz> since she steps on you
[3:08:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> i bought this game after the stream started and will practice to not enter evo
[3:08:22] <JustABaconStrip> wagner in UNIST is legit unga
[3:08:24] <itsgutsnotgatsu> wagner gets 6K off of throw in uniclr
[3:08:24] <Nekros4442> YEAYHHHHH
[3:08:28] <Dhurkst> totally not Tsubaki Yayoi
[3:08:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:08:29] <Solidnick18> hope she is stronk
[3:08:32] <+johnny_volcano> Wagner can get 6k off a throw now
[3:08:39] <gordieda20> She got better LUL
[3:08:40] <zenith0111> No dash Bs?
[3:08:40] <%yeknomlive> teddie vs mitsuru?
[3:08:44] <Man_in_the_Red> so did Wagner get buffed Kappa
[3:08:46] <+Nathillon> turbo unga wagner
[3:08:49] <JustABaconStrip> unga unga me wagner
[3:08:51] <killaholic89> not the only one that gets that off throw
[3:08:54] <JustABaconStrip> 6k off throw unga
[3:08:58] <itsgutsnotgatsu> wagner got buffed and also nerfed
[3:09:00] <$Noponiz> yo merkava's backdash is fucking wacky
[3:09:03] <$Noponiz> also seems really good
[3:09:06] <zenith0111> Risky Wagner
[3:09:08] <Man_in_the_Red> probably because only the US is vunerable to Redblade
[3:09:09] <itsgutsnotgatsu> she's still really strong
[3:09:56] <+johnny_volcano> I mained Seth in UNIST and adding the new air move into his routes is like relearning him all over again.
[3:09:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> i never really played any of these games. they look crazy though
[3:09:57] <zenith0111> YE YE YE
[3:10:07] <+johnny_volcano> Londrekia is super fun, too
[3:10:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> is this one of ther newer ones?
[3:10:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, i've felt like shit all day, think i'm sick as fuck, today kinda sucks
[3:10:22] <Man_in_the_Red> @theonecalledrock new release, yes
[3:10:32] <itsgutsnotgatsu> netplay londreika is gonna be wack
[3:10:47] <JustABaconStrip> netplay against half the roster is wack

[3:10:52] <zenith0111> Divide bl00dyTooLate
[3:10:53] <itsgutsnotgatsu> reacting to his rekka in the delay is gonna be a fucking thing
[3:10:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> might*
[3:11:22] <JustABaconStrip> i honestly think playing against phonons is the worst online

[3:11:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 23 minutes
[3:11:51] <+johnny_volcano> 70% of the reason I picked up Londrekia is the win animation
[3:12:16] <zenith0111> This Wagner is afraid to go in PogChamp
[3:12:36] <Man_in_the_Red> you know whats a shame, that fanatical bundle has Late, not even Unist LUL
[3:12:46] <+moonxbearx> So much mechanics doodTerror
[3:12:51] <itsgutsnotgatsu> wagner needs to reverse beat more. tho i think rb to 5a got nerfed in clr
[3:12:58] <JustABaconStrip> fanatical bundles only have dead games lmao

[3:13:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> i own 6 copies i think
[3:14:10] <$Noponiz> it barely warrants mention when it is on sale
[3:14:14] <JustABaconStrip> the best thing about skullgirls is the porn
[3:14:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> get out
[3:14:26] <skewerstar> Hey, is the netcode still delay based or did they switch to rollback?

[3:18:20] <Nekros4442> It has to be a counterhit right?
[3:18:21] <zenith0111> Only when he's attacking
[3:18:22] <JustABaconStrip> it works like eddie in GGXRD right?
[3:18:22] <%yeknomlive> apologize to him
[3:18:23] <$Noponiz> you can only hit his pupper as a punish

[3:23:44] <Laveyrin> for glory
[3:23:46] <zenith0111> WOOLIE WITH THE FAT BACK DOWN
[3:23:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> COMING FROM THE BLANKA MAIN
[3:23:47] <@Menitta> Mirrors are pure
[3:23:49] <%yeknomlive> lowain mirrors
[3:23:54] <Man_in_the_Red> but dont you like playing a game for 1 character Kappa
[3:23:56] <nothuzad> filthy blanka players V:
[3:23:58] <OkamiDude15> that mirror boss in dmc3 has woolie shook Kappa
[3:24:06] <Dhurkst> Ryu vs Ryu: Literally the most vanilla matchup possible in fighting games
[3:24:06] <+Hinasil> Typical blanka player
[3:24:12] <%Irridium> Love fighting a mirror who's better than me. Legit learn so much.
[3:24:18] <JustABaconStrip> real shit
[3:24:18] <%Hammerknife> wow i'm late to the party. sion is in this game.
[3:24:19] <+RichardMF_> I actually agree woolie, i fucking hate mirrors also
[3:24:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> blanka players always running after they shit on the floor
[3:24:28] <Man_in_the_Red> @dhurkst so much so it was the meta in Karate Champ Kappa
[3:24:29] <OkamiDude15> learning tech from a mirror is great
[3:24:30] <%yeknomlive> watching mirrors i hate but playing them i dont mind
[3:24:43] <@Solidus_113> Big Band mirrors are the best in fighting games
[3:24:46] <JustABaconStrip> watching mirrors is actually the worst
[3:25:01] <JustABaconStrip> evo japan tekken was awful
[3:25:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> for once, i agree with @Solidus_113
[3:25:05] <killaholic89> I prefer Potemkin mirrors mostly
[3:25:09] <+RealPT1> mirrors are the most honest games you can play
[3:25:12] <Dhurkst> @Solidus_113 especially when they play a duet
[3:25:17] <+paladinstarbuster> PogChamp DAMMN REGGIE
[3:25:20] <stormhawk9891> They were always there
[3:25:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> i like how this game handles combos
[3:25:36] <TigerClaws12> ok reggie
[3:25:41] <@Solidus_113> I point you all to this legendary video https://youtu.be/kPKwLdDbWMY
[3:25:44] <%yeknomlive> let's get those chesutos
[3:25:55] <%Exiliator> Reggie will win over Woolie and take the channel over for himself!
[3:26:08] <%yeknomlive> ambitious
[3:26:08] <JustABaconStrip> i like the big band mains that do musical shitposts while beating your ass
[3:26:20] <%Exiliator> Fight for the crown!
[3:26:25] <zenith0111> CALL OUT
[3:26:29] <+eanscrale> Reggie VS
[3:26:30] <+ThePiratePanda> he has NO honor
[3:26:36] <%yeknomlive> sick tho
[3:26:47] <+TheOneCalledRock> it looks like it has that sorta "combo into anything" that MvC has
[3:26:58] <%yeknomlive> it's reverse beat
[3:27:00] <Bryon_Youngblood> You know, in some cases, Merkava feels like he'd be a character you would see in Mortal Kombat, like he'd be a demon from the Netherrealm or something...
[3:27:01] <zenith0111> The tension D:
[3:27:04] <%SilverInferno3> Reggie Will Figure It Out
[3:27:09] <%yeknomlive> so yeah kinda but it's limited
[3:27:11] <zenith0111> YO
[3:27:15] <%FOGSHIE> @TheOneCalledRock That's called anime
[3:27:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> 1
[3:27:17] <@Solidus_113> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[3:27:21] <%SilverInferno3> SAW IT COMING
[3:27:22] <JustABaconStrip> imagine merkava's animations if he was in a moron kombat game atpRtsd
[3:27:24] <%Exiliator> woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:27:29] <stormhawk9891> @TheOneCalledRock In some aspects even more than MVC due to reverse beat
[3:27:33] <@Solidus_113> It didn't happen
[3:27:35] <ChinMusicTwo> woolieSMUG woolieVS PJSalt
[3:27:41] <dinosiurry> Merkava's entire body stays perfectly still while his arm stretches out
[3:27:45] <%yeknomlive> similar up until you would call in the assist
[3:27:48] <Man_in_the_Red> @justabaconstrip imagine any character playing like shit if they were put into MK LUL
[3:28:05] <%Exiliator> swag
[3:28:07] <Man_in_the_Red> its a garantee
[3:28:14] <+paladinstarbuster> PogChamp sbfpRage
[3:28:22] <dinosiurry> His hair has regular hair physics on it and just ends up obscuring his silhouette
[3:28:23] <Solidnick18> Swagtsuki
[3:28:26] <JustABaconStrip> why can't NRS just make a good fighting game
[3:28:27] <Bryon_Youngblood> Considering how tall Merkava is, that may be WHY his body stands still while his arms stretch
[3:28:28] <+Akizea> akatsuki is so fucking cool man
[3:28:30] <skewerstar> What would fatalities even look like on Merkava?
[3:28:39] <stormhawk9891> NGL I hate how Merkava's QCF doesn't have a hitbox on the arm
[3:28:43] <%SilverInferno3> Woah Woolz
[3:28:44] <JustABaconStrip> MK9 was the shit but after that it's just gotten worse
[3:28:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> nice
[3:28:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @justabaconstrip because what they do make sells better than good fighting games
[3:28:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> mk10 was great
[3:28:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> or mkX rather
[3:28:59] <+Akizea> MKX was great tho wat
[3:29:10] <%yeknomlive> mkx was mixed for a lot of people
[3:29:11] <dinosiurry> I at least appreciated the guest roster behind 9 and 10
[3:29:12] <@Solidus_113> AYYYY
[3:29:12] <JustABaconStrip> i fuckin hated MKX maybe im in the minority tho
[3:29:13] <dinosiurry> For the most part
[3:29:21] <+paladinstarbuster> sbfpScared
[3:29:23] <mrlastchance1> goin iiiiin
[3:29:23] <Suwaiya> bathwater loop on stream?
[3:29:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie's stylin
[3:29:31] <dinosiurry> Having Freddy in 9 and Jason in X, along with Alien and Predator
[3:29:31] <+Akizea> and MKX deff feels better than 11
[3:29:37] <%Irridium> I wanted to like MKX but the busted-ass PC port at launch and region-locked online play on consoles sure made it hard
[3:29:39] <skewerstar> like... does Merkava even have a skeleton for X-rays/Krushing Blows
[3:29:39] <%SilverInferno3> GGs
[3:29:39] <+Akizea> 11 just feels disgusting all in all
[3:29:50] <%Exiliator> Welcome back to REGGIE woolieVS !
[3:29:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:29:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> 11 is slow and fishing for krushing blows sucks
[3:30:03] <dinosiurry> I will say this every opportunity I get, but Jacket from Hotline Miami shoulda been in MK
[3:30:05] <Bryon_Youngblood> Well, Combo is Key, Woolie :D
[3:30:09] <JustABaconStrip> MK9 was just a fluke i guess
[3:30:24] <mrlastchance1> awwww they're wrapping up already?
[3:30:26] <JustABaconStrip> and then there's injustass atpRtsd
[3:30:30] <Man_in_the_Red> X was the closest i came to liking MK, and that was because it was AVP made into a fighter Kappa

[3:36:53] <dinosiurry> Excited to see what you think of Indie Pogo, Woolie. I can guarantee you've played at least five of the games repped here.
[3:36:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:37:34] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Lowain Bros Studios
[3:37:37] <%Exiliator> @CaptainPileDriver woolieSHOOK
[3:37:43] <+CryoExile> is this there first time playing?
[3:37:44] <mrlastchance1> Now that's how you start a fame
[3:37:47] <mrlastchance1> *game
[3:37:50] <%Superbro64> "dawg"
[3:37:50] <@Solidus_113> Is flux on your PC?
[3:37:55] <mrlastchance1> butter me up real good
[3:37:58] <Thunderhog> Bro please
[3:38:14] <%jiggy_snipe> this is too much
[3:38:29] <zenith0111> I'M DOWN
[3:38:30] <%jiggy_snipe> i like the music tho
[3:38:32] <%FenixSeraph> is the referee Meat from Vinesauce
[3:38:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> is this a fighting game
[3:38:46] <EndgameContent> Some nice squash and hold on those landing frames.
[3:38:50] <%Irridium> I'm glad they finally released actual past notes but... why two days after?
[3:38:50] <EndgameContent> Reminds me of Celeste.
[3:38:52] <@Solidus_113> Auto Divekick
[3:38:53] <OkamiDude15> woolie do you have flux on?
[3:39:05] <%Exiliator> yeah I think he has f.lux on
[3:39:08] <Man_in_the_Red> that face reminds me of something
[3:39:11] <micbro12> Kick comes out in a week yesss
[3:39:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Irridium because it's capcom
[3:39:25] <%Irridium> oh capcpom
[3:39:44] <amychibi> woolie do you plan to play children of morta? or try the free demo on steam to the game called backbone. is a noir type game
[3:39:57] <OkamiDude15> guess the star pop is a hit box
[3:40:06] <%Hammerknife> children of morta is....okay
[3:40:32] <+Jaysky> I like the concept of Morta
[3:40:49] <%Hammerknife> its a pretty short action rpg pretending to be a roguelike
[3:41:02] <EndgameContent> This game's got some juice
[3:41:12] <%Exiliator> Woolie do you have flux on?
[3:41:38] <micbro12> huh side specials were added to the tutorial
[3:41:49] <%SilverInferno3> It could also be Windows native Night mode
[3:41:52] <OkamiDude15> looks like you only eat it if you whiff side special
[3:42:19] <dinosiurry> Fun fact that the game does not explain properly: you can hold that down special to place a star in the air, and then you use neutral special to launch the star towards you.
[3:42:47] <%yeknomlive> wat's flux
[3:42:51] <Man_in_the_Red> that reminds me, when' s the Get into Fighting games for either Touhou fighter
[3:43:08] <%SilverInferno3> @yeknomlive Night mode pretty much, tones down the blues in your monitor for less eye strain
[3:43:09] <@Solidus_113> It changes a monitor's lighting for night time

[3:49:45] <+Chasmic> Kick's not in until next Saturday
[3:49:45] <EndgameContent> You mean Earl and Toe Jam?
[3:50:09] <dinosiurry> Turn off hazards. Trus me.
[3:50:11] <%SilverInferno3> OH MY GOD
[3:50:19] <%Exiliator> LUL
[3:50:22] <Thunderhog> YO AND SHE COMES IN WITH THE CREW
[3:50:37] <@Menitta> Oh wow the fight intro changes
[3:50:39] <@Menitta> Thats cool
[3:51:23] <%Superbro64> didn't the creator of flappy bird get a bucketload of death threats and hateful emails?
[3:51:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:51:24] <dinosiurry> Melee attacks you can throw out, but special moves you recharge by landing on the ground.
[3:51:48] <%Hammerknife> the guy who made flappy bird basically went off the grid iirc
[3:52:03] <%SilverInferno3> poor guy
[3:52:17] <%Hammerknife> eh he made a ridiculous amount of money. probably worked out
[3:52:36] <Thunderhog> Double boost?
[3:52:42] <+TheOneCalledRock> jesus
[3:52:45] <dinosiurry> The star increases the power of some of your moves.
[3:53:07] <%SilverInferno3> Still, online hate can get to you. Hopefully some of that money went to therapy.
[3:53:34] <+POINTEEEE> game looks slow
[3:53:38] <Thunderhog> She seems stright forward if you remembered how to play freedom planet from what it seems
[3:53:47] <dinosiurry> To be fair, neither of these guys know how to play
[3:53:53] <%Superbro64> Nipping this in the bud now. I highly, HIGHLY doubt that money is a good trade off for mental health in any capacity
[3:53:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, i can't take it anymore, i feel like i'm about to black out, good night chat, see ya'll late
[3:54:13] <+NotHereToStream> night cpd
[3:54:18] <%SilverInferno3> Bye Cap, get that battery recharged
[3:54:27] <%Hammerknife> this feels like a game i would have seen on newgrounds in 2007
[3:54:28] <%SilverInferno3> @Superbro64 Agreed
[3:54:35] <+thebeargoesHONK> Woolie, you should play the new Toejam and Earl game
[3:54:42] <@Solidus_113> Looks like they're tied to items, and not the person themselves
[3:54:53] <+CryoExile> yes
[3:54:53] <JDebss> Duk
[3:54:58] <Potatoidea> Nice
[3:55:04] <%SilverInferno3> Coool
[3:55:05] <DedlokPM> mogsQuack
[3:55:34] <dinosiurry> The fastest way to make lodsamoney is to play infinite pogo
[3:55:47] <MayorRev> is shovel knight in this
[3:55:48] <@Solidus_113> The Orca from Rivals of Aether and a Bullet from Gungeon are in here too
[3:55:48] <%Irridium> yo that's the dude from that mountain climbing game
[3:56:02] <%Irridium> and also history I guess
[3:56:11] <%SilverInferno3> WutFace
[3:56:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> ngl this game's character picks feel like a fever dream
[3:56:12] <dinosiurry> And this stage is from Two Brothers, the first game from the studio that made YIIK
[3:56:14] <dinosiurry> The More You Know
[3:56:16] <+RealPT1> did wooley completely miss out on getting over it?
[3:56:28] <%Exiliator> Be careful not to fall Reggie Kappa
[3:56:30] <DedlokPM> YO! Silent Hill Axe Throw attack! rooPog
[3:56:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> oh shit stage hazards

[3:56:54] <MayorRev> ah there he is
[3:56:59] <%SilverInferno3> WHAT
[3:57:04] <%SilverInferno3> IN THE POT
[3:57:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> this game is wild
[3:57:25] <dinosiurry> Diogenes has weird recovery - you gotta use his hammer melees to climb up walls
[3:57:25] <%SilverInferno3> When's Thief from Thief Simulator
[3:58:06] <%Hammerknife> the character selection here reminds me a bit of PS all stars. just random shit tossed together
[3:58:24] <pingas7073> press down to be invincible with pot
[3:58:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:58:42] <dinosiurry> Also, turn off the stage hazards in the stage select
[3:59:56] <%SilverInferno3> This game really doesn't seem built for 1v1 lol
[4:00:15] <@Solidus_113> hazards off
[4:00:15] <dinosiurry> Turn off hazards
[4:00:19] <@Solidus_113> L2/R2
[4:00:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Hammerknife at least this game still has consistency with all it's characters being indie games unlike allstars LUL
[4:00:28] <JDebss> That lady is just Baiken
[4:00:37] <%SilverInferno3> Woaaahhh Canabalt holy shit
[4:00:47] <%Hammerknife> is canabalt old enough to vote yet
[4:00:48] <dinosiurry> @WoolieVersus press L2/R2 in the stage select to turn off hazards
[4:01:06] <%Hammerknife> 11 years old. holy shit.
[4:01:17] <NeroInfinite> That was dad's chainsaw
[4:01:21] <%SilverInferno3> Canabalt was like 2d mirrors edge to me
[4:01:37] <%SilverInferno3> WOAH
[4:01:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> canabalt was that endless runner mobile game right?
[4:02:03] <%SilverInferno3> I think it had proper levels?
[4:02:12] <%SilverInferno3> Was it endless?
[4:02:20] <NeroInfinite> It had proper levels
[4:02:21] <%Exiliator> Mirrors edge was like a 3d Canabalt Kappa
[4:02:25] <%Hammerknife> it started as a flash game, went to phones
[4:02:28] <dinosiurry> The original version was endless, I think they made a paid version later with proper levels
[4:02:38] <%SilverInferno3> Ah I see
[4:02:42] <%Hammerknife> was it the first endless runner?
[4:02:49] <NeroInfinite> Yeah the free flash one was endless, the paid version had proper levels
[4:03:41] <%SilverInferno3> Damn I miss that era
[4:04:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> is it bad that i only know like, 3 characters in this game? LUL
[4:04:23] <NeroInfinite> I was less fat and much younger in that era

[4:05:32] <NeroInfinite> Pink Guy LUL
[4:05:33] <JDebss> He looked like he was from MXC
[4:05:50] <MayorRev> "THIS- This is-is NOT okay. This needs to top, NOW"
[4:06:45] <%Exiliator> This game reminds me a bit of those newgrounds flashes were random retro characters fought eachother
[4:06:55] <dinosiurry> So most of the unlockable characters are pretty niche, but the most notable ones are the kid from Teslagrad, Viridian from VVVVVV, Orcane from Rivals of Aether, the main character of Downwell, and the bullet from Enter the Gungeon
[4:07:09] <%Hammerknife> it actually does one of the old flash tricks
[4:07:10] <NeroInfinite> The NG rumbles were like this
[4:07:41] <%Hammerknife> if you watch as the characters hit the ground and prepare to jump again, they dont actually animate the frames, they just shrink the sprite in vertical
[4:07:41] <%SilverInferno3> Oh I see the problem with my message lol
[4:08:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah this game totally has an aura of "newgrounds flash game"
[4:08:17] <%SilverInferno3> Be careful how you abbreviate, kids
[4:08:17] <dinosiurry> Whatever word just got censored, it's weird that "fuckin" was not
[4:08:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> not that its a bad thing
[4:08:31] <%SilverInferno3> Was it censored lol
[4:09:08] <%Hammerknife> the only thing it needs to finish it out is having independently moving layers animated at a different fps than the main layer
[4:09:38] <%SilverInferno3> Saved
[4:09:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> uh
[4:09:54] <dinosiurry> It's from a game called INK
[4:09:59] <+TheOneCalledRock> WOAH
[4:10:07] <%SilverInferno3> Banned
[4:10:11] <%SilverInferno3> Banned already
[4:10:14] <JDebss> yooo
[4:10:36] <zamzoph> There's something on Woolie's face
[4:11:06] <NeroInfinite> Thats the mic
[4:11:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok but what if the stage layout changes every time you play on it
[4:12:46] <JDebss> Lets see some Supers!
[4:12:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:13:04] <JDebss> lol
[4:13:12] <@Solidus_113> you need to get 5 gems
[4:13:19] <dinosiurry> It doesn't - it originally was going to, but they decided against it
[4:13:46] <dinosiurry> However, in the update next week they're gonna add stage variants to certain stages
[4:13:54] <@Solidus_113> laaaaaame
[4:14:15] <JDebss> Reggie's got some moves!
[4:14:43] <dinosiurry> At that particular time, they had no clue how to code random elements for online, because y'know, that can lead to some real desync if it's done wrong
[4:15:27] <dinosiurry> They figured it out in time for Bullet from Enter the Gungeon to appear
[4:15:43] <pingas7073> teslagrad
[4:15:43] <SixthSun2> Teslagrad
[4:15:45] <spardanwarrior> Teslagrad
[4:15:51] <nothuzad> Teslagrad ye
[4:16:01] <pingas7073> it's a puzzle game
[4:16:09] <SixthSun2> There's bound to be a few indies in this you've not heard of
[4:16:21] <%Hammerknife> i got 40 minutes into teslagrad before i threw in the towel. i didnt find it compelling
[4:16:58] <DedlokPM> millisecond
[4:17:12] <%Hammerknife> that being said world to the west is quite good
[4:17:40] <@Solidus_113> VVVVVVV
[4:17:45] <TigerClaws12> is this delay based?
[4:17:45] <DedlokPM> VVV guy?

[4:22:10] <%Hammerknife> isnt the entire point of downwell that there's no bottom
[4:22:18] <TigerClaws12> what's the netcode?
[4:22:20] <%Hammerknife> how do you get a stage out
[4:22:23] <+Chasmic> Also there is debugging codes to unlock all characters, you could ask the dev about it
[4:22:27] <dinosiurry> It's Game Maker Studeio netcode
[4:22:30] <+Mecha_G> is that a bullet from Enter the Gungeon?
[4:22:31] <TigerClaws12> ah
