[0:23:34] <cerazor01> Ew Yatagarasu. Don't @ me
[0:23:42] <beefomkers> Yun still rocks the fucking magnetosphere when you play him I see
[0:23:43] <Datwiseguy> wait its mainly a tournament fighters night?
[0:23:48] <CerberusDriver> Akuma, les go
[0:23:50] <+thunderhog> It was either that or "When's Melty?"
[0:23:51] <%fatal_penguin_> Oh it is beer
[0:23:54] <KeiPrime> whens sailor moon you cowards
[0:23:56] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> CHEERS
[0:23:57] <beefomkers> Very cool
[0:24:00] <%NumberTooBig> you know, always wondered why they went for a universal win screen rather than just letting the game do it
[0:24:04] <%UrsulaCat> Donat
[0:24:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, for the evo announcement tonight what games do you think are gonna make it
[0:24:08] <aura_0> WOOLIE HAS OBTAINED HIS TRUE FORM
[0:24:12] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> drunk fighters baby

[0:24:15] <%fatal_penguin_> Should of gotten some 40s instead, true thug
[0:24:19] <odd_slater> SourPls

[0:24:22] <cerazor01> NotLikeThis
[0:24:25] <prime_name> THE NUT MAN PogChamp
[0:24:26] <+jzfpouch> kof 13
[0:24:26] <Datwiseguy> TMNT parsec?
[0:24:28] <%UrsulaCat> Cheers
[0:24:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus what about KOF13 SPRITES
[0:24:30] <+ssulcer> play ken or chun lee, pick the right supers
[0:24:31] <CerberusDriver> i really wish street fighter 6 would be sprite based
[0:24:32] <%DylanDec> Just beat a dude online in Hugo mirrors and I am so hyped
[0:24:51] <@Menitta> KOFXIII has good sprites but I dig 3rd Strike's animation more
[0:24:56] <thwak> reminder you can see oro's balls in a couple of frames
[0:25:00] <%Twoiis> 3s for evo2019 woolieSMUG
[0:25:01] <%NumberTooBig> Under night has sprites good enough to close up on, Kof 13 didnt go bankrupt for nothing
[0:25:02] <Datwiseguy> Blazblueeeeeeee?
[0:25:03] <%fatal_penguin_> They should let you fight the horses in the background
[0:25:07] <odd_slater> KOF XIII is godtier
[0:25:21] <%NumberTooBig> but 3S assuredly has the best in animations
[0:25:25] <+jzfpouch> i give you 99
[0:25:28] <%Machomanohyeeaa> @fatal_penguin_ yea they should be like a bonus round or something
[0:25:33] <odd_slater> Can we get a KOF XIII UM? pls?
[0:25:40] <ARBITERWARPIG> KOF XIII is actually insane
[0:25:44] <mistersups> 3rd strike ain't in the top 5. But It's an honorable mention in FightingGame Beauty
[0:25:45] <%zenkiro_> If only snk ported kofXIII to current gen
[0:25:57] <didgereedoodah> Orie's dress tho
[0:26:04] <%UrsulaCat> Read donat before I zzzzzz

[0:26:48] <Marmotato> Long live 3rd Strike
[0:26:51] <%NumberTooBig> actually, i remember 13's netcode was nonexistant, did they fix it till then
[0:26:52] <jubejube56> 3d models on a 2d plane

[0:30:43] <+Tbnero> MutantXp and Vencabot are the 3s scenes on Twitch @woolieversus
[0:30:45] <fawleerunlan> @tbnero Reminder that game is the one where Zero can spawn Cyber Elves out of nowhere

[0:31:08] <+Tbnero> oh yes I am very aware @fawleerunlan
[0:31:10] <rkblitz> @WoolieVersus can you put it to arcade mode so that we can see the victory screens? i love seeing those what rank ppl get
[0:31:14] <+kingoftuesdaynight> And it's THIRD STRIKE!
[0:31:31] <SchlongKongEduardo> red parry huh LUL
[0:31:42] <%Sulliman34> we all had a moment of hope when we heard ryu was getting his donkey kick back in sf5...then we saw it
[0:31:49] <ROYSKRULL> nice ryu
[0:31:53] <fawleerunlan> @tbnero But at the same time, SVC wasn't too bad. Goenitz can still die in fire though
[0:32:01] <ARBITERWARPIG> That thing fucking whiffs at max range in SFV
[0:32:02] <+Destructive_Forces> That's a nasty Ryu
[0:32:05] <+RoboBro1212> @fawleerunlan KOKO DESU KA

[0:32:35] <ROYSKRULL> uff urien
[0:32:43] <fawleerunlan> @robobro1212 "YOU WISH TO CONTINUE? MY, THAT'S A BAD IDEA..."
[0:32:45] <+kingoftuesdaynight> @exploitativity2 Sounds good to me. I'm still a total scrub at this game, only picked it up a few weeks ago cause my local arcade has a cab.
[0:32:45] <mistersups> Dr. Manhatten!
[0:32:49] <%Sulliman34> Urien really out here with the best back throw in SF history
[0:33:06] <ARBITERWARPIG> WHO'S GOT URIEN UNBLOCKABLES THO
[0:33:07] <+kingoftuesdaynight> It's definitely the game that's made me series about fighting games tho, it's so fucking good.
[0:33:19] <Emomancer> @kingoftuesdaynight Lucky you. My country doesn't even have arcades
[0:33:24] <tacostarvedbeast> I love uriens blocking’s sound
[0:33:28] <Marmotato> Urien's throw has the sauce of command grab
[0:33:30] <blizzardinertia> @emomancer same here
[0:33:38] <ARBITERWARPIG> GIVE US THE CHEAP SHIT
[0:33:41] <ConeCorvid> lol
[0:33:44] <%Sulliman34> i gotta say urien translated PRETTY well to sf5
[0:33:48] <%Sulliman34> unlike a certain grappler
[0:33:56] <Novillion> LUL
[0:33:56] <CerberusDriver> shame about SF5 in general
[0:34:01] <+noajenkk> yoooo
[0:34:11] <fawleerunlan> Alex got fucked over in that game real hard.
[0:34:12] <ROYSKRULL> urien the best
[0:34:13] <BananaBread101> Is that why he's not in sf5?
[0:34:18] <rufus2k2> 3rd strike baybee
[0:34:19] <CerberusDriver> I really dont like the art style for 5, I liked 4s art style cuz it was new
[0:34:26] <+kingoftuesdaynight> How long has the stream been going?
[0:34:32] <%Sulliman34> yeah despite the beefyness of everyone i loved the painted inky style of 4
[0:34:33] <Datwiseguy> YEYEYE
[0:34:35] <CerberusDriver> also akuma in 5 looks dumb and Ken looks busted
[0:34:35] <%Sulliman34> 5 just looks so bland
[0:34:35] <rufus2k2> !uptime

[0:34:56] <+Renegaderade99> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye 3rd strike lets go
[0:35:01] <blizzardinertia> @bananabread101 Capcom hasn't decided who to bring back yet for future dlc
[0:35:10] <%Billyuppercut0> woolieYE
[0:35:16] <%NumberTooBig> speaking of ink, anyone else gonna try topump Samurai Spirits full of cash
[0:35:19] <ARBITERWARPIG> I thought everyone knew about taunts in this game?
[0:35:31] <CerberusDriver> Taunting in games is amazing
[0:35:37] <CerberusDriver> DMC, street fighter, whatever
[0:35:38] <%ChoculaUltra> I kind of dig the new Akuma design from SFV. V comfy and cuddly.
[0:35:41] <Finchit> is Q G's dad?
[0:35:43] <%zenkiro_> Dudleys theme woolieGASM
[0:35:46] <Finchit> imma say yes
[0:35:50] <Datwiseguy> the clawwwww
[0:35:51] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Dudley's theme is hella
[0:35:52] <Emomancer> @ARBITERWARPIG People who haven't played the game certainly don't
[0:35:55] <Emomancer> like me
[0:35:55] <CerberusDriver> @ChoculaUltra bruh
[0:36:02] <+RoboBro1212> stopping a super with your fingernails tho
[0:36:05] <ARBITERWARPIG> Learn the lore
[0:36:12] <Marmotato> it's always fun when people get salty over taunts in this game when you are increasing stats LUL
[0:36:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:36:13] <rad_dude123465> Q is the fucking coolest
[0:36:28] <+RoboBro1212> Q IS the fucking coolest
[0:36:32] <%fatal_penguin_> Delivery Q man wins
[0:36:34] <Finchit> Q more like Queue
[0:36:34] <SchlongKongEduardo> i like the theory where G is urien/gill's third brother/father thats in the midst of mentally degenerating into Q
[0:36:41] <%Solidnick18> sean?
[0:36:44] <blizzardinertia> @robobro1212 what about sean matsuda?
[0:36:47] <%NumberTooBig> G is also the coolest, coincidence???? probably
[0:36:51] <aura_0> @woolieversus yo, EVO reveal is gonna go in 10 minutes!
[0:37:01] <Baconrath> Twelve secretly best character Kappa
[0:37:04] <+RoboBro1212> @blizzardinertia I dunno Twelve's my favorite design other than Q

[0:37:21] <+thunderhog> DQ
[0:37:22] <+RoboBro1212> he may be dumpster tier
[0:37:23] <jubejube56> This is the peak of street fighter character design
[0:37:24] <mistersups> DQ
[0:37:25] <SirPurple > hell yeah 3rd strike
[0:37:25] <+RoboBro1212> but he's fucking awesome
[0:37:29] <fawleerunlan> Q is Robot Detective K with Deadly Double Stab, Critical Combo Finishes and Total Destruction.
[0:37:29] <Nehson> yuunBUTT yuunBLUSH grmTHICC
[0:37:32] <%Billyuppercut0> I wish I could win with Twelve
[0:37:34] <+Destructive_Forces> 12 with them meaty ass buttons
[0:37:44] <rufus2k2> tattooed russian blanka with little girl in tow
[0:37:45] <Novillion> Necro is one of my favorites, I hope he's never in SFV
[0:37:48] <+GreatestGuess> Dairy Queen NotLikeThis
[0:37:52] <+kingoftuesdaynight> seabatHITBOX seabatHITBOX
[0:37:52] <ARBITERWARPIG> Necro is a failed experiment and was a normal kid before Gill got to him
[0:37:53] <mistersups> Twelve is the lowest Tier
[0:37:57] <+VoidHaunter> Man, I miss Necro so much
[0:38:07] <ARBITERWARPIG> Now he's on the run with his gf
[0:38:09] <Nehson> whats necros quirk
[0:38:20] <rufus2k2> I dare Capcom to put Remy in SF5
[0:38:22] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Necro is this game's dhalsim
[0:38:23] <%NumberTooBig> @Nehson he's blanka but sings
[0:38:31] <odd_slater> Evo line up happening soon
[0:38:54] <CerberusDriver> Twelve freaks me out
[0:38:54] <ARBITERWARPIG> Did they already do Guilty Gear for this show?
[0:39:00] <+VoidHaunter> Necro is a mix of Dhalsim and Blanka and is the best version of either of those characters
[0:39:05] <jeybull13> this game is crack
[0:39:07] <blizzardinertia> @arbiterwarpig maybe
[0:39:10] <%Solidnick18> Yes @ARBITERWARPIG
[0:39:11] <fawleerunlan> @rufus2k2 They'll just ruin him like they did Alex.
[0:39:19] <ARBITERWARPIG> Xrd?
[0:39:23] <rufus2k2> @fawleerunlan y'aint wrong
[0:39:23] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Does not shaking blanka hands extend to necro players too?

[0:42:30] <+JustGrim> fuck
[0:42:35] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Yo, elena top tier waifu every day
[0:42:36] <+GreatestGuess> Million Arthur isn’t going to be a main game in a million years, but it will def have a side tourney. Nobody is gonna play Jump Force
[0:42:39] <+JustGrim> online edition music is so good
[0:42:40] <+kingoftuesdaynight> EVERY day.
[0:42:41] <CerberusDriver> did he justparry the ball
[0:42:48] <%NumberTooBig> @McAngrimStein assuming there isnt videos on Jump force 13 Kappa
[0:42:51] <fmc009> No Makoto no views SwiftRage
[0:42:52] <rufus2k2> like Woolie and Pat been saying, Capcom needs to do an in-house franchise fighter crossover
[0:42:57] <+VoidHaunter> 2nd Impact was sick. I HATED 3rd Strike when it came out.
[0:43:03] <McAngrimStein> @NumberTooBig That's too grim a future even for me
[0:43:09] <+kingoftuesdaynight> VS Capcom when?
[0:43:10] <blizzardinertia> @voidhaunter really?
[0:43:11] <+Plankman> @CerberusDriver i mean, one of the bonus games is parrying basketballs, so it's not a surprise
[0:43:11] <CerberusDriver> seans so busted in impact
[0:43:13] <+JustGrim> YOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:43:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:43:14] <Kenny_Riot> Rooting for Elena
[0:43:14] <+2woping> BALL IS LITERALLY LIFE
[0:43:17] <SirPurple > lol
[0:43:19] <Kenny_Riot> gotta root for your main
[0:43:23] <rufus2k2> no annoying third party, lemme see Maximo and Asura and Gene from God hand fighting against each other
[0:43:24] <%Solidnick18> Elena is hearing
[0:43:25] <CerberusDriver> @Plankman i know but mid match
[0:43:30] <fawleerunlan> @rufus2k2 But dear lord, DO NOT make it like Capcom Fighting Jam.
[0:43:43] <KeiPrime> just waiting for all the gacha games to have fighting games, we already got fate, granblue coming , million arthur coming, whats next, pad?
[0:43:47] <SomersaultJustice> Cartoon Network Punch Time Explosion for EVO
[0:43:49] <rufus2k2> yeah for sure, take your time
[0:43:58] <+Plankman> Them's fightin herds for evo
[0:43:59] <+RocketBarrel> @rufus2k2 Woolie, Pat and Max have been saying that for years. Capcom is just sitting on a gold mine. Just make it lime UMVC3 but tone down the comeback factor
[0:43:59] <rufus2k2> no more Morrigan sprites
[0:43:59] <Archmortal> The obvious problem with the roll is that it doesn't maintain your style meter like a taunt does
[0:44:02] <%Solidnick18> i feel that
[0:44:05] <Marmotato> whens rival schools man
[0:44:09] <odd_slater> Kreygasm

[0:44:21] <%Solidnick18> i think it is
[0:44:31] <rufus2k2> @RocketBarrel heck yes
[0:44:34] <fawleerunlan> Remember that CFJ was one of Ono's first game at Capcom.
[0:44:36] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Elena deserves all that animation

[0:46:35] <+kingoftuesdaynight> A punching bag that bleeds is no opponent for me.
[0:46:40] <mr_miyagichu> Dudley is so fun
[0:46:41] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Dudley is worth it
[0:46:41] <ManOfReason> yeah, how come you never got around to maining dudley?
[0:46:44] <rufus2k2> Steve Fox probably has a Dudley poster in his room, how dare you Woolie
[0:46:46] <+kingoftuesdaynight> He's so fuckin fun.
[0:46:49] <%Feifong_wong> Woolie plays Balrog? or is he not stylish enough?
[0:46:52] <MattriX77> Dudley wants you back in the garbage: GUTTER TRASH!
[0:47:02] <TheGypsyClaw> Im about to hadou burst my pants KappaPride
[0:47:02] <fawleerunlan> Just make it an all Capcom fighter with SF, Darkstalkers, Red Earth, Star Gladiator, Megaman, Asura's Wrath, God Hand etc. No more MVC games.
[0:47:03] <+kingoftuesdaynight> I'm going to get good at him someday
[0:47:07] <tacostarvedbeast> Blanka players have no dignity
[0:47:08] <KillJayKill> Are you gonna watch the evo reveal?
[0:47:10] <mr_miyagichu> The character specific corner routes are so satisfying
[0:47:14] <Jakev91489> Awe shit, 3rd Strike tonight!
[0:47:16] <KillJayKill> If not, what do you predict
[0:47:38] <+Plankman> my all time fave has got to be SF4 Dan
[0:47:38] <tacostarvedbeast> Yea that makes sense
[0:47:39] <%yuribo26> Competing with the EVO announcement, BOLD MOVES WOOLIE
[0:47:40] <@Menitta> Woolie mains Makoto, yeah?
[0:47:45] <+kingoftuesdaynight> what color dudley tho? There IS a right choice
[0:47:53] <%yuribo26> @Menitta Woolie waifus Makoto
[0:48:01] <Jakev91489> Red dudley all day
[0:48:04] <Marmotato> Mako <3
[0:48:10] <%NumberTooBig> anyone thinking if SFV would look better cel shaded
[0:48:12] <@Menitta> Color 2 or Color 6 Dudders
[0:48:12] <tacostarvedbeast> Pink and white dudders?
[0:48:25] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Pink and white is the correct answer
[0:48:26] <+Plankman> i miss sf4
[0:48:27] <%yeknomlive> dempsey thunder
[0:48:27] <+kingoftuesdaynight> So good
[0:48:40] <KeiPrime> just use rolling thunder, coward
[0:48:45] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Pink is the color of class.
[0:49:17] <KeiPrime> this fucking drum n bass soundtrack
[0:49:30] <+Aztec50> evo STARTED
[0:49:32] <%yeknomlive> remember pat tactics of having them block the first crockscrew and then throw a second one
[0:49:37] <+Plankman> i just remembered how the soul calibur 2 arcade cabinets, you could select all kinds of game modes, from the typical classic mode, survival, etc.
[0:49:38] <marvel877> evo now
[0:49:39] <jubejube56> evo is live
[0:49:40] <+Plankman> but you could also
[0:49:43] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Did y'all know the Third Strike soundtrack is on spotify
[0:49:47] <+Plankman> use your credit for like 5 minutes of practice mode
[0:50:00] <+kingoftuesdaynight> @Plankman That's sick.
[0:50:04] <%NumberTooBig> a lot of Capcom stuff is on spotify, now theres a reason to use spotify
[0:50:08] <+JustGrim> i'm familiar with negative edge, not pianoing tho
[0:50:34] <%NumberTooBig> that said Under Night's also there, also a sick soundtrack

[0:58:31] <+PeaceCentennial> well they said Skullgirls was too new at 3 months before EVO, right?
[0:58:35] <+Plankman> i want panzerfaust to be real...
[0:58:51] <+Plankman> they said it was too new when skullgirls had been out for more than a year
[0:58:53] <kurotodangenm> panzerfaust is prety👌
[0:59:16] <%NumberTooBig> @Plankman remember, Crosstag wasnt too new for evo Kappa
[0:59:34] <mr_miyagichu> @plankman there probably won’t be another skullgirls for the foreseeable future it sounds like autum games still owes lab zero money
[0:59:35] <+GenesisKnight> Skullgirls was too indie for main stage Evo
[0:59:44] <SomersaultJustice> come onnnnnnn sc6
[0:59:51] <theotrainwreck> skullgirls was too sexy for evo
[0:59:53] <+Plankman> TOO HOT 4 EVO
[0:59:59] <mistersups> SC6
[0:59:59] <marvel877> SC6

[1:01:17] <KeiPrime> clown 2b tho
[1:01:17] <%yeknomlive> but they're breakable
[1:01:18] <+2woping> They only confirmed SC6 so that they could deconfirm Ivy later
[1:01:22] <fawleerunlan> @robobro1212 VO might be too niche for the real EVO, I can see it on Anime Evo.
[1:01:24] <mistersups> The chat for EVO is just CORE VALUES over and over
[1:01:36] <fawleerunlan> *though
[1:01:36] <%wolfofsound> @mistersups you had to know it would be
[1:01:37] <Plague_Nurse> Perfectly balanced

[1:09:28] <SomersaultJustice> they're talking about melee on stream
[1:09:28] <@Menitta> Understatement of the century. It had an amazing run.
[1:09:29] <Bloogoose> No Guilty Gear FeelsBadMan
[1:09:30] <Midnight_Crest> Melee had its time in the sun happy UNIST is in

[1:10:21] <+Reaper102388> Melee gets Sand Coffin'd
[1:10:21] <fawleerunlan> SonicFox can place first in Brutal: Paws of Fury Kappa
[1:10:34] <KaironFortressKnight> EVO is taking a shower live on stream
[1:10:47] <@Menitta> What exactly is a red parry?
[1:10:51] <LibriJamm> @NumberTooBig Thats the hope! (and 2nd worry...)
[1:10:58] <Bazookya> red parry is a parry out of block stun
[1:11:03] <@Menitta> Guard into parry? Ah
[1:11:08] <Bloogoose> I can't believe Guilty Gear sacrificed itself to kill Melee
[1:11:10] <Bazookya> you have very few frames to pull it off
[1:11:23] <Bazookya> the timing is much MUCH tighter
[1:11:29] <%PunishedRaccoon> MELEE DEAD
[1:11:30] <%PunishedRaccoon> WOOOOO
[1:11:30] <Dral54> MELEE IS FUCKING DEAD
[1:11:38] <Plague_Nurse> finally
[1:11:39] <Shiranui24> UNIST is here!
[1:11:40] <SomersaultJustice> no doa
[1:11:48] <@Menitta> A normal parry is 10 frames?
[1:11:48] <metrying> NO SOUND
[1:11:50] <revzero25> Melelle needed to die but im really supriesed about UNIST and Sammurai Showdown
[1:11:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:12:05] <%PunishedRaccoon> 2 GAMES HAVENT EVEN COME OUT BUT MELEE DEAD SO IDGAF
[1:12:16] <Plague_Nurse> Fisticuffs is not alive
[1:12:25] <husbando_speedwagon> UNIEL is win
[1:12:26] <Bazookya> i think red is like 3
[1:12:28] <tomahank18> Man that still hurts
[1:12:30] <Bazookya> but dont take that to the bank
[1:12:30] <KaironFortressKnight> SamSho makes me so damn happu
[1:12:33] <@Menitta> Jeeez thats a window
[1:12:34] <KaironFortressKnight> happy*
[1:12:35] <KeiPrime> also no xrd
[1:12:35] <+LordJimmyBones> SAMSHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:12:36] <KeiPrime> so fk
[1:12:38] <Bloogoose> God I'm so happy UNIST is in
[1:12:56] <husbando_speedwagon> they deserve it
[1:13:00] <ManOfReason> im glad for unist and samsho but sad for melee
[1:13:01] <revzero25> I wanted DOA but Ill take Unist and Showdown way over melee
[1:13:05] <LeonSteel> MElEE IS DEA LUL
[1:13:05] <%yeknomlive> at least mk11 has like 4 months. samsho's going be real close
[1:13:07] <husbando_speedwagon> f*ckin finally
[1:13:12] <+Exyoh> Big hype for SamSho being there. SNK is back, fellas
[1:13:23] <SomersaultJustice> I hope samsho is good
[1:13:24] <Plague_Nurse> Jump Force at EVO when apatSmug
[1:13:28] <Bazookya> mk11 needs to change or it isnt going to have a very good competitive scene for long
[1:13:31] <revzero25> @Exyoh now give us garou or cvs 3
[1:13:43] <CalderGaming> @Plague_Nurse you joke but they had pokken once
[1:13:53] <KeiPrime> pokken was a mistake
[1:14:12] <husbando_speedwagon> I like SamSho, but it should have been KOF14 instead.
[1:14:14] <+JustGrim> oh my god that's where revolving hook came from
[1:14:18] <+JustGrim> it was just a dudley move the whole time
[1:14:22] <@Menitta> No Pokken is great tho...
[1:14:24] <+Exyoh> Does Obari still want to do another Fatal Fury movie? Now's a good time
[1:14:27] <%Solidnick18> Unist getting in is great
[1:14:29] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:14:37] <KeiPrime> yeah, they should have given kof another year, the new characters are all good
[1:14:42] <CalderGaming> after Core Values I'm not surprised they skipped on DOA6
[1:14:56] <@Menitta> I'd bet money on KOFXV being announced at EVO
[1:15:00] <Kristoffers> My eyes were looking over the twitch page and my head snapped back as I noticed some 3rd strike in the corner
[1:15:10] <Bazookya> i think that has a bit before its announced
[1:15:12] <SomersaultJustice> team ninja will just build their own evo, with blackjack etc etc
[1:15:13] <Bazookya> but that would be rad
[1:15:21] <KeiPrime> and "gravure" idols
[1:15:24] <%NumberTooBig> KOF XV exists, thats for sure, doubt theres anything to show now
[1:15:26] <@Menitta> It was confirmed a while back
[1:15:30] <KeiPrime> yuka kuramoti tho...
[1:15:41] <Bazookya> yeah, they said it has a ton of time before its out
[1:15:49] <+RoboBro1212> hopin KoF15 looks good visually
[1:15:52] <husbando_speedwagon> we know KOFXV is real
[1:15:54] <+JustGrim> i have a question, what the fuck is a red parry
[1:15:54] <jubejube56> when does samsho release?
[1:15:59] <KeiPrime> doa6 for next week??
[1:16:03] <Lotharman> Which is the best version of this game?
[1:16:04] <%Solidnick18> they said the summer
[1:16:04] <Bazookya> okay @WoolieVersus what is the fighter you think you are the best at?
[1:16:05] <+RoboBro1212> I mean I know it's a bit shallow to judge games based on looks but KoF14 is fugly
[1:16:14] <jubejube56> @JustGrim I believe it is parrying from a blocking state
[1:16:14] <Kristoffers> where's the online most alive for this game?
[1:16:20] <%Solidnick18> doa6 is march 1st
[1:16:24] <%oweniguess> @lotharman online edition but unfort not many people play it over 30th
[1:16:28] <mistersups> Charcoal?
[1:16:30] <KeiPrime> i mean for stream next week
[1:16:34] <husbando_speedwagon> fightcade
[1:16:35] <Floofiie> @Kristoffers Either the newest version which is 30th or fightcade
[1:16:38] <revzero25> well they did have a very limited budget but i have more fun with that game than sfv
[1:16:39] <CozyGUNNA> what do you think makes a excellent fighting game character design
[1:16:43] <mistersups> Charcoal!
[1:16:45] <kurotodangenm> tfw you also have bronchitis
[1:16:48] <CalderGaming> @Bazookya I'm going to guess SFIV but let's see if I'm right
[1:16:52] <%yuribo26> I heard this charcoal thing on the podcast
[1:16:53] <%Solidnick18> huh
[1:16:55] <SomersaultJustice> maybe you should go to the hospital
[1:16:56] <+RoboBro1212> really activates my almonds vargThink
[1:17:05] <Floofiie> *ALMONDS ACTIVATED*
[1:17:06] <Bazookya> i'd say you have a good shot playing any game on weekend nights
[1:17:10] <DeathGripsSan> this set is hot
[1:17:12] <@Menitta> its not like...barbecue rocks
[1:17:14] <mistersups> I've heard it elsewhere. Woolie isn't *as* weird
[1:17:15] <+AntithesisEK> charcoal is a natural toxin absorptive material
[1:17:19] <dj_jellocups> UNIST is in boys
[1:17:20] <%NumberTooBig> Kof 14 was really fun to play, if any thing 15 only getting a revamp in graphics and new graphics would be enough LUL
[1:17:29] <th3madness> melee got buried boys
[1:17:29] <%NumberTooBig> new characters*
[1:17:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RVMSpeedWagon
[1:17:39] <+Cebardo> Unist next week in celebration???
[1:17:39] <KeiPrime> when someone says the word toxin, im immediately like, this is some quack bs
[1:17:41] <SomersaultJustice> I missed the announcement, is max getting a panel?
[1:17:47] <%DedlokPM> YOY BREATHE OUT CARBON DIOXIDE! Not pure carbon
[1:17:54] <Bazookya> i just wonder of the new kof will stick to this more simple style of 14 or go back to something like 13
[1:17:55] <husbando_speedwagon> I hope Kof15 roster is good. Team America please
[1:17:58] <kurotodangenm> yall ever just breath carbon
[1:18:00] <+PeaceCentennial> What version of Yatagarasu are they going to play? Because the steam version keeps crashing on startup
[1:18:01] <mistersups> It's very POWERFUL
[1:18:03] <+Noponiz> uniest lets gooo
[1:18:04] <@Menitta> I had bronchitis during a chem exam. I failed. Fun times
[1:18:06] <SomersaultJustice> they should just show riki oh at a panel
[1:18:15] <Floofiie> Skullgirls got #corevalued in hindsight
[1:18:22] <Vizus34> BREATHE CARBON! WHAT?
[1:18:23] <GhostLanterns> you have to be careful w carbon cleanses it can can out an vital medications
[1:18:26] <Bazookya> i just want geese
[1:18:27] <mistersups> No Yatagarasu. Issues. Game did not want to be played
[1:18:27] <rolothakid> For real doe?
[1:18:28] <revzero25> i want rock in the base game since he's canon now
[1:18:34] <DeadMaannn> yooooo third strike
[1:18:35] <GhostLanterns> *can cancel out
[1:18:41] <KeiPrime> yeah doa took the hit to expose the truth behind skullgirls
[1:18:42] <+Reaper102388> Because pills cost more
[1:18:42] <Bazookya> what about yata @mistersups ?
[1:18:46] <Bazookya> i love that shit
[1:18:47] <MTLxSpider> 3rd strike avec HENRI

[1:18:51] <MTLxSpider> :O
[1:18:51] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:19:19] <%NumberTooBig> @WoolieVersus think your second game tonight would be Alpha 2 or Skullgirls
[1:19:21] <SomersaultJustice> go to combo round
[1:19:23] <+kingoftuesdaynight> So fun fact
[1:19:27] <mistersups> Damn! Come to Atlanta Woolie!
[1:19:39] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Mister CEO himself was at my local arcade last weekend
[1:19:39] <+drdocphd> WOOLIE MELEE IS DEAD
[1:19:53] <%wolfofsound> EVO just smells better already
[1:19:57] <DeadMaannn> best game lol
[1:20:08] <+JustGrim> @WoolieVersus hey i have a question, what in god's name is a red parry
[1:20:14] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Jebailey was there jamming SFII Turbo with the owner
[1:20:21] <+pkmamsters> WATER CONFIRMED
[1:20:21] <Bazookya> red parry is a parry off block stun
[1:20:25] <alchefire> So that Evo list is real? I missed the stream
[1:20:28] <+JustGrim> weird, okay noted
[1:20:28] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Took a set off the owner, got a lifetime pass for his troubles
[1:20:31] <husbando_speedwagon> @woolieversus Yo check out the Evo lineup my dude. UNIEST confirmed
[1:20:32] <Bazookya> very very tight timing
[1:20:35] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus Could you guys show off Makoto later on? I'd like to learn her.
[1:20:41] <+JustGrim> he's been seeing the evo lineup
[1:20:41] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @mistersups
[1:21:02] <+PenmanLupine> @husbando_speedwagon woolie knows
[1:21:11] <Floofiie> @husbando_speedwagon woolie knows
[1:21:22] <tungstenviper> @mistersups dude, ask the mods about posting links
[1:21:22] <%NumberTooBig> @husbando_speedwagon woolieREMEMBERS
[1:21:35] <chaozagents> @WoolieVersus so I want to get better at playing defensively and blocking, do you guys have any advice? GGRev2 player mostly.
[1:21:37] <husbando_speedwagon> ah okay gents
[1:22:09] <SomersaultJustice> INFINITE - Third Strike
[1:22:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> #EVO2019 WHAT HAPPENED TO DOA6?
[1:22:25] <Kenny_Riot> @chaozagents follow PatTheFlip for that
[1:22:56] <basedjabroni> yo whats up woolie
[1:23:07] <Bazookya> my question Kreygasm
[1:23:15] <Bazookya> melee? SwiftRage
[1:23:19] <Senipo> LUL
[1:23:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Melee Kappa
[1:23:21] <Bazookya> i said fighting game
[1:23:24] <husbando_speedwagon> what happened to GGREV2? BBTAG replacing it is nuts.
[1:23:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> core values
[1:23:41] <dking0000> Im more upset at GG getting cut than Melee
[1:23:46] <+RoboBro1212> yeah I don't get the BBTag over Xrd choice, kinda jank
[1:23:49] <Shiranui24> Ultimax
[1:23:55] <CalderGaming> ayyy i was right
[1:24:37] <@Menitta> Pokken for me PokPikachu
[1:24:44] <+masta7> I guess they just picked bbtag cause it’s new
[1:24:47] <dking0000> I hope with Samurai Showdown getting in we hear some shit from SNK
[1:24:52] <$konekoryugamine> YEYEYEYE
[1:24:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> online edition
[1:24:55] <Bazookya> this game is very flawed, but its fine. like all fighting games
[1:24:55] <+RoboBro1212> Virtual On Oratorio Tangram bois where you at
[1:25:00] <dking0000> Isn’t KOF 15 in development?
[1:25:02] <Naxip420> UNIST JUST GOT ANNOUNCED FOR EVO!
[1:25:08] <husbando_speedwagon> yeah people complain about the parry system killing neutral in 3rd Strike
[1:25:09] <SomersaultJustice> xrd is kind of dead, in that there isn't a new gg coming out
[1:25:11] <@Menitta> @dking0000 yes
[1:25:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> ps2
[1:25:24] <+kingoftuesdaynight> OE needs a steam release
[1:25:24] <SomersaultJustice> but bbtag is still getting stuff
[1:25:51] <+kingoftuesdaynight> But I'll agree, my favorite way to play Third Strike is to hit the arcade
[1:25:55] <LeaIsChill> CORE VALUES NEXT WEEK Pog
[1:25:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:25:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S DEAD
[1:25:59] <+jman0625> Woolie what do you think of the lack of Melee at EVO?
[1:26:02] <+JustGrim> no woolie your core values tho
[1:26:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus you know pat, he's creepy enough to play DOA
[1:26:10] <Bazookya> @WoolieVersus you should try those mame 3s trials at some point
[1:26:13] <husbando_speedwagon> and building meter by just tapping normals is cheap in 3rd Strike
[1:26:14] <sodapopSquid> Rip Melee atpRtsd
[1:26:15] <dking0000> Man I hope kof gets some kinda announcement at Evo, kof 14 is so good but gets no play
[1:26:17] <Floofiie> Fight of Gods expert 🤔
[1:26:18] <Bazookya> they are stupid hard
[1:26:30] <SomersaultJustice> Woolie: DOA6 does not fit this channel's core values *cuts to Bible Black ending*
[1:26:40] <ArtThouBored> Yeah but thaat's sonic fox
[1:26:40] <mistersups> !MOTIVATED
[1:26:41] <@Moobot> 170 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:27:09] <Sk8t3> As good as GGXR2 is, the online lobby in the west is deserted.
[1:27:11] <mistersups> Woolie was the Fight of Gods expert. Bible school!
[1:27:12] <+Personified134> has everyone in here already talked about the evo lineup
[1:27:20] <CalderGaming> yup
[1:27:24] <mistersups> Yes we talked evo lineup
[1:27:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'm so happy UNIST is getting it's due now
[1:27:29] <%NumberTooBig> @SomersaultJustice there is a guilty gear in the late concept art phase, thats for sure
[1:27:30] <+Personified134> melee moon2PH
[1:27:33] <+Neoepochx> core values
[1:27:35] <%yeknomlive> chat yelled out the line up as it happened
[1:27:36] <VictorySauce23> MELEE IS DEAD
[1:27:37] <wolf_hurricane> GOD FUCKIGN BLESS
[1:27:38] <ArtThouBored> I'm happy to have Soul Calibur 6 in the lineup
[1:27:38] <wolf_hurricane> MELEE DEAD
[1:27:39] <VictorySauce23> THANK GOD
[1:27:49] <ArtThouBored> Poor game+community is getting overlooked
[1:27:50] <wolf_hurricane> MR. WIZ REDEEMED
[1:27:53] <+Personified134> how yall gonna be mad at melee
[1:27:58] <Bloogoose> Guilty Gear sacrificed itself to kill Melee
[1:28:02] <shadowgilgamesh> RIP in stink Melee StinkyCheese
[1:28:04] <dking0000> Hope Samurai Showdown ain’t jank
[1:28:08] <wolf_hurricane> press S to spit on grave
[1:28:10] <wolf_hurricane> S
[1:28:11] <Bloogoose> S
[1:28:15] <+Neoepochx> S
[1:28:17] <CerberusDriver> the pros whining about Melee give me life
[1:28:21] <shadowgilgamesh> S
[1:28:21] <grayjammer> S
[1:28:23] <%Solidnick18> S?
[1:28:24] <Sk8t3> CAPITAL S
[1:28:28] <tungstenviper> S
[1:28:31] <%NumberTooBig> @Bloogoose correction, it was sacrificed for samsho being shown off and under night getting stream time
[1:28:31] <@Menitta> We do know about the EVO line up btw
[1:28:40] <ArtThouBored> I guesS but I never cared about Smash
[1:28:41] <ShreddingPixels> S
[1:28:48] <Vizus34> are you guys gonna play online?
[1:28:49] <+Personified134> yall some ice cold haters
[1:28:52] <%NumberTooBig> its a big big lamb to put in the ritual circle
[1:28:59] <+reiju_22> melee is trending on twitter LUL
[1:29:08] <CorruptDropbear> EVO vs Woolie?
[1:29:37] <Sk8t3> Woolie vs EVO when?
[1:29:45] <+Neoepochx> Does SamSho even have a release date?
[1:29:52] <%NumberTooBig> @Neoepochx this summer
[1:29:54] <tungstenviper> @Personified134 I never see 3rd Strike main tournaments like Melee did. if that isn't bs i don't know what is...
[1:29:59] <+RoboBro1212> SamSho's art style reminds me of SF4 but animated way better
[1:30:00] <ArtThouBored> I hope the schedules for MK11 and Soul Calibur 6 don't conflict but they probably will. I can always catch Tekken 7 and Fighter Z later on
[1:30:08] <+Neoepochx> DoA is out next month right?
[1:30:14] <%NumberTooBig> they said early so i assume late june-early july
[1:30:26] <CerberusDriver> >evo viewership is gonna drop without melee - delusional melee players
[1:30:27] <%yeknomlive> 3rd strike has that coop tourney every january
[1:30:34] <husbando_speedwagon> call me its Woolie vs Anarchy Reigns.
[1:30:46] <Bazookya> denjin is so scummy
[1:30:52] <%shmupdogjoe> return of the curbstomp symphony?
[1:30:53] <+Personified134> melee breaks evos concurrent viewer records all the time
[1:31:03] <SomersaultJustice> 4 games on sunday this year
[1:31:13] <CerberusDriver> who cares, lets get some new shit in evo
[1:31:16] <+Personified134> i'm with you on 3rd strike tho, i'd rather see this than 5 any day
[1:31:18] <+DarkNerdShawny> Did they talk about the Samurai Showdown news that just got announced yet?
[1:31:19] <CerberusDriver> melee is boring as hell
[1:31:21] <husbando_speedwagon> denjin is honest
[1:31:27] <Bazookya> yeah
[1:31:30] <Bazookya> so honest
[1:31:31] <+AmanDotZip> finally, the man's game is played
[1:31:38] <%NumberTooBig> @DarkNerdShawny trailer, and it comes out early summer
[1:31:40] <+RoboBro1212> melee montages are fun to watch but man just watching the game straight is pretty fuckin repetitive
[1:31:46] <+Reaper102388> Dong Dong Never Die when?
[1:32:02] <ArtThouBored> Stinky Day is over
[1:32:06] <heyitsdenzel_> Truth is PSP
[1:32:08] <CorruptDropbear> I think the decision is basically a 50/50 on "does Melee stay forever or will Ultimate take over" - and the other side is that the 9000 CRTs don't have to be set up
[1:32:09] <CerberusDriver> @RoboBro1212 and its the same 5 people passing around the trophy
[1:32:19] <+RoboBro1212> @CerberusDriver that doesn't help
[1:32:19] <+DarkNerdShawny> @NumberTooBig did they watch the trailer on stream?
[1:32:23] <shoutouttoglogang> Is streetfighter 30th Anniversary worth getting or should i get Usf4 instead(im playing ps4).
[1:32:27] <Core_Value> I never thought I would stand with the smelee players but, EVO HAS FAILED US ALL REEE
[1:32:28] <CorruptDropbear> nothing else uses CRTs, so they can all go to LCD monitors for the games?
[1:32:29] <tomahank18> Budokai Tenkaiichi 3 when?
[1:32:29] <%yeknomlive> they werent watching stream
[1:32:41] <dking0000> Pretty sure USF4 is dead on PS4
[1:32:43] <Bazookya> there may be more players on usf4 on ps4
[1:32:44] <%NumberTooBig> @DarkNerdShawny oh thats what you meant, no, 3S too hype
[1:32:51] <SomersaultJustice> my only wish for 30th anniversary is that you can have a 3P or 3K button
[1:32:51] <Bazookya> but if you are a sf fan, 30th is pretty great
[1:32:53] <+DarkNerdShawny> hahaha
[1:32:56] <%shmupdogjoe> The CRTs and need to actually maintain and repair 10 year old controllers makes Melee appeal to me on a primal level... Shame about the game and much of the playerbase (at least in reputation)
[1:32:56] <+PeaceCentennial> I'm so happy that UNIEST got in. It makes me sad that it is replacing GGXRD because that's the game I was training in, but UNIEST deserves that spot
[1:32:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:02] <%Belutima> WOW DBFZ isnt on Sunday Evo evoMindBlown
[1:33:07] <CorruptDropbear> It might end up being a pure logistics issue?
[1:33:10] <+RoboBro1212> I kinda wanna get into Uniest now tbh
[1:33:16] <+PeaceCentennial> UNIEST IS SUPER LEGIT
[1:33:22] <TheactualDiepod> What’s the ego lineup?
[1:33:24] <+AmanDotZip> waddup chat
[1:33:30] <SomersaultJustice> evo stream done
[1:33:32] <+RoboBro1212> I love super aggressive non-marvel-style games
[1:33:35] <TheactualDiepod> Evo I meant
[1:33:38] <+RoboBro1212> like jojo and ds3
[1:33:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @fmc009
[1:33:41] <+PeaceCentennial> Like there is nothing I would have accepted to replace GGXRD than UNIEST
[1:33:44] <CorruptDropbear> Also Under Night replaces Guilty Gear? That's odd for a casual viewer but the community seems to be hype
[1:33:48] <%shmupdogjoe> I get so much shit for calling it UNIEST.
[1:33:49] <dking0000> I’m more excited about SNK having some sorta spot again
[1:33:51] <AnimatedTako> @TheactualDiepod samurai showdown
[1:34:03] <fmc009> Meele is fucking dead praise Daisuke Kreygasm
[1:34:05] <%NumberTooBig> @TheactualDiepod the usual suspects, SC6, Under night, SamSho, and mk11
[1:34:09] <CorruptDropbear> The only confusing game is Samurai Showdown aka SKULLGIRLS DIED FOR THIS
[1:34:11] <+PeaceCentennial> @CorruptDropbear UNIEST is one of the best fighting games ever released so the anime community is happy
[1:34:11] <husbando_speedwagon> remember kids, always hit the lab
[1:34:12] <ArtThouBored> I'm especially glad Soul Calibur 6 isn't IvySiegmare the Game the experience after those patches
[1:34:14] <+AmanDotZip> I G O T T H E P I C T U R E
[1:34:15] <@Menitta> Unfortunately the lobby function in this is very bad
[1:34:15] <%yeknomlive> tekken 7, sfv, smash ult, sc6, bbtag,uniest,samsho,mk11,dbfz
[1:34:19] <zackmuffin> I’m here from the eco stream how’s everyone doing
[1:34:23] <MTLxSpider> hey does thay mean Akatsuki blitzkampf finally on the main lineup of evo
[1:34:24] <ManOfReason> unist is awesome. but people need to chill with "x game is dead". communties like guilty gear and melee are still going strong, let them decide when it is actually dead.
[1:34:27] <ikasukiz> hi woolie
[1:34:29] <zackmuffin> *evo
[1:34:29] <CalderGaming> "UNIELST"
[1:34:43] <+RoboBro1212> games aren't dead until you literally can't find a match online at all
[1:34:51] <dking0000> “Anime was a mistake” - Melee players
[1:34:51] <+RoboBro1212> or go the Dawngate route and cease to exist
[1:34:52] <Finaldragoon> no Melee at EVO, we're all free now
[1:34:52] <+projectrad> That EVO 2019 lineup reveal tho...
[1:34:52] <ArtThouBored> @zackmuffin recording movesets so I get some knowledge in SC6
[1:34:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> dragonball isn't a sunday game
[1:34:53] <CorruptDropbear> Melee will never die, and Guilty Gear is going to be at Japan Evo most likely
[1:34:54] <CerberusDriver> Melee isn't dead but it's 'solved'
[1:34:54] <CalderGaming> like radical heights
[1:34:55] <%UserGold23> evooooooo
[1:34:56] <shoutouttoglogang> Which game has the content as a whole 30th anniversary or Usf4
[1:34:59] <+AmanDotZip> does woolie even read chat :/
[1:35:03] <fmc009> destroy all CRTs. Time for freedom
[1:35:04] <ArtThouBored> I'm sick of getting mixed by Sophitia
[1:35:06] <shoutouttoglogang> Has the most*
[1:35:06] <zackmuffin> @artthoubored nice
[1:35:09] <%NumberTooBig> and Discord make sure theres always a match so nothing's dead
[1:35:14] <+PeaceCentennial> nah the next one will be Under Night In-Birth Exe: Late[ST]: Eternal Remembrance AKA UNIESTER
[1:35:21] <%NumberTooBig> until servers go down of course
[1:35:21] <+AmanDotZip> ofc not mid match but i mean
[1:35:27] <+AmanDotZip> never seems to
[1:35:37] <CorruptDropbear> If you wanted to make a move from Melee to Ultimate this isn't the way to do it
[1:35:41] <supersanic94> Woolie no Boolie
[1:35:43] <+Reaper102388> Charged
[1:35:46] <%yuribo26> Speed?
[1:35:57] <+President_Miyazaki> Melee is dead. The evil defeated. We're free.
[1:36:04] <CorruptDropbear> Melee will never die
[1:36:19] <+blazinbooty69> melee needs a shower
[1:36:22] <CalderGaming> melee got hit by gold experience requiem
[1:36:35] <CerberusDriver> EVO just needs new shit is all, and Melee definitely isn't 'new shit'
[1:36:38] <leroypi> Good Guy Guilty Gear died to defeat Melee!!!!
[1:36:40] <speximillian> Hungrybox is now the Forever King of Melee, for Melee is no more.
[1:37:02] <+projectrad> Guilty Gear was Goku sacrificing himself to save EVO from Melee Cell
[1:37:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> wow, i cannot believe dbfz isn't a sunday finals game
[1:37:04] <+Personified134> nah, Leffen won the last EVO
[1:37:08] <+Reaper102388> Combo Dropped
[1:37:09] <CalderGaming> given that there are smash-exclusive tourneys that's definitely not true
[1:37:09] <SomersaultJustice> HBox: Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair!
[1:37:10] <+RoboBro1212> Melee is to fighting games what dota is to RTS's tbh
[1:37:10] <+Personified134> and he's gonna be talking shit about that
[1:37:11] <ArtThouBored> Speaking of ForeverKing you see that lineup for MK11 at Summit?
[1:37:13] <+Personified134> for the next decade
[1:37:17] <zackmuffin> @leroypi one day it will be resurrected for it’s bravery
[1:37:17] <tomahank18> Melee needs a good crop dusting with aerosol deodorant.
[1:37:30] <CorruptDropbear> In fact I'm expecting that with the numbers that other tournaments that are Melee + Ultimate events will show, EVO will decide to go to a Melee + Ultimate timetable next year. It's probably a "Ultimate is the newest one and lots of people are moving to it so lets test the waters"
[1:37:31] <ArtThouBored> Holy shit I've never seen a more stacked lineup of MK players
[1:37:39] <%UserGold23> can we axe BBxTag for a wildcard game or something?
[1:37:41] <CerberusDriver> also, Melee fans crying MVC2 playing a violin for you
[1:37:42] <%NumberTooBig> @zackmuffin or the son steps up to the palte
[1:37:47] <Novillion> Yeah, Evo's dropped better games in favor of the newer title before, so this is really a big thing
[1:37:50] <ArtThouBored> And all that fgc drama for nothing
[1:38:01] <%UserGold23> if we revolt enough, will they change games
[1:38:02] <zackmuffin> @numbertoobig to avenge its father
[1:38:04] <leroypi> @zackmuffin One day
[1:38:04] <Novillion> *isn't
[1:38:11] <CerberusDriver> Just saying, Melee fans cant be crying about much; when better games haven't been at EVO in ages
[1:38:16] <CorruptDropbear> BBxTag is the BlazBlue game - I don't think you can kill BlazBlue unless they don't make a new version in the next two years
[1:38:29] <speximillian> Someday we’ll get our Skullgirls at EVO
[1:38:35] <%NumberTooBig> @zackmuffin Guilty Gear 3: With[OUT] a Vengence Kappa
[1:38:50] <CorruptDropbear> Samurai Showdown is the Skullgirls was Robbed pick of this year
[1:39:04] <Asiveni> KOF is dead BibleThump
[1:39:05] <+RoboBro1212> if they didn't make virtual on 5 with such a shitty crossover maybe we'd have a chance of an English port and evo spot
[1:39:09] <+ChrisAlgoo> doesn't melee still pull the big numbers tho?
[1:39:19] <CorruptDropbear> Also there will be a Melee side event, just won't be on big stage?
[1:39:22] <%NumberTooBig> @CorruptDropbear i'd say MK11 is but sure
[1:39:50] <CorruptDropbear> MK11 is the replacement for Injustice 2 (ie the NetherRealm Fighter series)
[1:39:52] <ArtThouBored> No way MK11 wasn't going to be at EVO
[1:39:54] <+RoboBro1212> rose of steeeeel
[1:39:58] <Storm_Samurai> I wonder when Samurai Shodown will release, EVO is Aug 2-4, only 5 months left? Not much time to learn
[1:39:58] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:40:13] <%NumberTooBig> @Storm_Samurai early summer
[1:40:16] <CorruptDropbear> That being said MK11 in DOA6 out is going to be just reinforcing the CORE VALUES meme
[1:40:16] <%yeknomlive> samsho releases in summer so way less than 5
[1:40:20] <CerberusDriver> im excited for EVO very much now
[1:40:23] <ManOfReason> tbh, the biggest surprise for me was bbtag, but it was definitely a welcome one.
[1:40:28] <BurdRightsActivist> 🦀MELEE IS DEAD! 🦀
[1:40:29] <+RoboBro1212> core values vargNut
[1:40:40] <CorruptDropbear> BBTag might have been removed for Under Night?
[1:40:43] <CorruptDropbear> but even then
[1:40:51] <ArtThouBored> Nobody should take the Core Values seriously enough to say "This game shouldn't be in over this this game"
[1:40:59] <SomersaultJustice> well, at least this is sorta confirmation that samurai shodown is coming out before June
[1:41:01] <+fragdar> woolie is player 1 or 2?
[1:41:13] <SomersaultJustice> I mean before august
[1:41:18] <+RoboBro1212> I don't give a fuck about doa I just like weemen
[1:41:19] <zackmuffin> I was surprised by under night the most but no one else seems to be so I guess it’s more popular than I thought
[1:41:27] <ArtThouBored> In all that Core Values silliness, nobody made a peep about Soul Calibur 6
[1:41:36] <ArtThouBored> And Markman was even commentating the thing
[1:41:37] <+RoboBro1212> Soul Calibur 6 is jank af ngl
[1:41:40] <Datwiseguy> hey oro is a cool old guy
[1:41:44] <%Twoiis> I actually really wanted to see what DOA had to show.
[1:41:45] <+Davojam> 3rd Strike PogChamp
[1:41:47] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CorruptDropbear
[1:41:49] <+RoboBro1212> I fucking hate that red counter mechanic shit
[1:41:57] <+RoboBro1212> reversal edge I think?
[1:42:01] <ManOfReason> also, hyped to see two 3d fighters in evo now
[1:42:03] <CorruptDropbear> Do note: I am an esports industry asshole, not a FGC person
[1:42:12] <ArtThouBored> But the difference between SC6 and DOA is SC6 didn't have models bouncing their boobs around
[1:42:18] <CorruptDropbear> so I'm just speculating on the sponsor/idea side
[1:42:22] <SomersaultJustice> watch SC6 patchs out clothes exploding
[1:42:35] <Datwiseguy> SC6 Has tiddie jiggie, wacha talkin about
[1:42:48] <ArtThouBored> That's vidya titty jiggle
[1:42:51] <husbando_speedwagon> Ryu the honest man
[1:42:51] <%mister_rogers> Yang is my jam in this game
[1:42:53] <ManOfReason> @ArtThouBored i mean ivy is pretty close lol
[1:42:55] <%NumberTooBig> SC6 isnt against core values because it's fantasy i guess
[1:43:12] <%NumberTooBig> or what ever it is now that 2B is in
[1:43:22] <Bazookya> throw them
[1:43:24] <%yeknomlive> ivy has always been way worse
[1:43:24] <Bazookya> a lot
[1:43:30] <%mister_rogers> i do not remember getting gifted a sub lol
[1:43:32] <CorruptDropbear> MK11 isn't against Core Values sbfpRichard
[1:43:33] <%yeknomlive> except for sc 2
[1:43:34] <ArtThouBored> Guests aren't canon in SC
[1:43:34] <%mister_rogers> but i'll take it
[1:43:46] <ArtThouBored> Well....Kratos.
[1:43:49] <SomersaultJustice> bring back angol fear!
[1:43:52] <coreybom> With SC6, fan service isn't the draw. With DOA 6, it is the draw.
[1:43:53] <ArtThouBored> MOST Guests aren't canon in SC
[1:44:02] <CerberusDriver> Leffen is so mad rn, i love it
[1:44:04] <ArtThouBored> @coreybom pretty much
[1:44:08] <husbando_speedwagon> why is Woolie learning Dudley now?
[1:44:09] <+RoboBro1212> also 2B's super long marvel block string bullshit is the worst
[1:44:13] <+RoboBro1212> fuck that character
[1:44:19] <ManOfReason> But for real tho, whens foozies getting in evo?
[1:44:20] <OroOreo> sans under night in-birth EX:LATE
[1:44:44] <husbando_speedwagon> When's Million Arthur for Evo
[1:44:57] <%shmupdogjoe> I was going to say it was weird that Soul Calibur never had DOA's reputation despite being just as free with the panty shots...
[1:44:57] <CerberusDriver> whens capcom vs snk 2 for evo
[1:45:04] <+projectrad> Leffen has to actually work for his EVO Chamipnship this year XD
[1:45:09] <Bazookya> the parry window in that game shifts. its weird
[1:45:09] <%shmupdogjoe> then I remembered that there's no Soul Calibur Extreme Beach Volleyball
[1:45:09] <zackmuffin> @manofreason can you imagine that on the main stage
[1:45:10] <neroame> Yooo Third Strike
[1:45:10] <+FrostedZaibatsu> woops2B @RoboBro1212
[1:45:19] <%shmupdogjoe> that pretty much did it for DOA as a serious fighter no matter what.
[1:45:32] <+RoboBro1212> @FrostedZaibatsu also I'd fuck that character vargNut
[1:45:37] <zackmuffin> @shmupdogjoe fair enough
[1:45:37] <YeezusPieces1> Glad UNIST will be on the main stage this year. Best 2d fighter roght now imo
[1:45:49] <coreybom> @shmupdogjoe Well with soul, you gotta work for the panty shot. With DOA, they give you it upfront for free.
[1:45:49] <+FrostedZaibatsu> TMI
[1:45:51] <%shmupdogjoe> Also no VR experience where you just, like, give Talim a massage or whatever
[1:45:53] <CalderGaming> @CerberusDriver 2003-2008 Kappa
[1:45:55] <+RoboBro1212> no U
[1:46:08] <%shmupdogjoe> Nah, the wind actually whipped those skirts and loincloths around pretty liberally in SC 1
[1:46:13] <tungstenviper> Woolie with the hard whiffs LUL
[1:46:15] <%shmupdogjoe> 2 seemed to tone it down slightly
[1:46:16] <zackmuffin> @shmupdogjoe real hard to back petal after that
[1:46:18] <Nekros4442> So who else is hyped about UNIST at EVO mainstage?
[1:46:26] <basedjabroni> isn't makoto woolie's main?
[1:46:28] <zackmuffin> *pedal
[1:46:30] <+lazylazejv5> me I love UNIEST
[1:46:33] <ArtThouBored> The most worried I am is that SC6 gets screwed over in terms of airtime
[1:46:38] <Datwiseguy> unist main stage is a thing of beauty
[1:46:43] <%yeknomlive> they always learn new character during these sessions
[1:46:44] <%GunterDriger6> I'm really suprised to SamSho on the main stage
[1:46:50] <@Menitta> PS, the lobby system sucks
[1:46:51] <the_Deadpan_Man> yall see the EVO lineup?
[1:46:59] <Datwiseguy> i dont even care that its prob a sat finals
[1:46:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:07] <Datwiseguy> !MOTIVATED
[1:47:08] <@Moobot> 171 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:47:08] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @basedjabroni [insert short haired girl] woolie's main
[1:47:11] <%GunterDriger6> But excited as well
[1:47:13] <coreybom> @shmupdogjoe Well yeah, that happened in 1 but they since toned it down. With DOA, they only just turned it down. and even then, not by much.
[1:47:15] <ArtThouBored> Japan Evo was hype but the choice to not air the second half of pools annoyed me
[1:47:15] <husbando_speedwagon> Woolie using low fierce but not using CB
[1:47:16] <@Menitta> Imma comin
[1:47:24] <Datwiseguy> dats not 3s
[1:47:25] <+cjellex> Melee is dead
[1:47:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'M BACK
[1:47:35] <YeezusPieces1> I got in boys
[1:47:35] <ArtThouBored> Because nothing else was on, They cut SC6 Pools for Dead Air
[1:47:37] <IKilledADeadGuy> Make sure to set input lag on 0 for the online options
[1:47:37] <SomersaultJustice> there's a picture of melee as fat cell and ggxrd as goku and unist as gohan
[1:47:38] <the_Deadpan_Man> MELEE IS DEAD
[1:47:41] <tungstenviper> @WoolieVersus yes EX machine gun blow starting frames are airborne cause Dudley does a hop.
[1:47:45] <CirclesForever> !commands
[1:47:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:45] <+projectrad> ALPHA 3 YO!!
[1:47:47] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> ALPHA 3 BABY
[1:47:47] <BwdYeti> LUL
[1:47:48] <%mintyrobo> Now no one is happy LUL
[1:47:48] <@Menitta> A little.
[1:47:52] <wolvenelf> lmao
[1:47:53] <+Reaper102388> WE ALPHA 3 NOW
[1:47:56] <@Menitta> Press triangle over all the other games
[1:47:56] <%yeknomlive> yeeee!
[1:48:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @projectrad
[1:48:00] <husbando_speedwagon> play super turbo
[1:48:01] <Silenos> Kappa
[1:48:06] <CerberusDriver> ALPHA 3 BOYS
[1:48:07] <mistersups> CHANGE THE CATEGORY WOOLIE
[1:48:07] <+RoboBro1212> this game might not have the best art, but it absolutely has the coolest aesthetic
[1:48:12] <ManOfReason> secret bonus game PogChamp
[1:48:14] <+projectrad> actual footage of Woolie playing Alpha 3
[1:48:14] <JetpackMcQuack> Intermission
[1:48:21] <Bazookya> this game is silly as hell
[1:48:23] <ArtThouBored> I'm also super curious how MK11 is going to handle Custom Variations in a Tournament Setting
[1:48:30] <+RoboBro1212> V-ism is a thing
[1:48:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> just don't rematch
[1:48:41] <Silenos> Secretly he wanted this MVGame
[1:48:44] <labanderox> weird thing about sam sho is that we haven't even seen anything abou tsamsho except the first few trailers at least BBTAG had gameplay already before the announcement at evo last year
[1:48:49] <husbando_speedwagon> V-ism is custom combo
[1:48:52] <fawleerunlan> "LET'S PARTY! FACE HIM STRAIGHT!
[1:48:53] <%shmupdogjoe> Woah, how'd they get Honda into 3rd Strike?
[1:48:57] <CorruptDropbear> I think MK11 has "Tournament Mode" Variations
[1:49:03] <CorruptDropbear> where it goes to the default three
[1:49:07] <CorruptDropbear> or whatever
[1:49:14] <ArtThouBored> Yeah but we havent seen them yet
[1:49:25] <+RoboBro1212> V-ism is almost entirely why this game is so jank lol
[1:49:26] <JetpackMcQuack> I see woolie picked pseudo blanka
[1:49:34] <ArtThouBored> Not that I'm impatient but just really interested how they handle it
[1:49:39] <+RoboBro1212> Mike "Woolie" Ross
[1:49:42] <+blackkanye> Guys please help me I can't stop laughing
[1:49:43] <Silenos> This is no spin blanka Kappa
[1:49:50] <+PeaceCentennial> oh did someone switch the thing to Alpha
[1:49:57] <+alolanslowpoke> I leave for 5 minutes and they're playing Alpha?
[1:49:58] <+PeaceCentennial> one of the weirdest parts of this collection
[1:50:01] <CalderGaming> keep in mind that melee was main stage at evo for the first time in 2007 and didn't get back up until 2013 so it could still come back... even though I don't care if it does
[1:50:01] <husbando_speedwagon> Mike Ross "The Guilty Gear player"
[1:50:01] <+alolanslowpoke> Wha happuh?
[1:50:04] <HanPaul> pick Oro
[1:50:06] <@Menitta> Alpha 3 just makes me think of Saltybet now
[1:50:09] <donkey_b1tchass> I miss Mike Ross
[1:50:14] <+ren173> so Melee isn't at EVO this year
[1:50:16] <%yeknomlive> mike ross doesnt play gg. waxel does
[1:50:16] <+PeaceCentennial> "oh do you want to do Third Strike? fuck you it's time for Street Fighter 1"
[1:50:17] <CerberusDriver> why do people hate alpha 3
[1:50:19] <JetpackMcQuack> gameat4F
[1:50:20] <ManOfReason> oh damn, will we see mike "waxl" ross without guilty gear this year?
[1:50:21] <jase__x> I miss Mike and gootecks
[1:50:24] <+blackkanye> UNIST has defeated the evil
[1:50:25] <%mintyrobo> woolieS
[1:50:30] <HanPaul> who's Mike Ross? i only know lord WAXL
[1:50:32] <ArtThouBored> I think announcing MK11 this late was a great idea, because it eliminates the worst thing about the Hype train of fightan reveals
[1:50:41] <ArtThouBored> Which is waiting for the damn train to get steam
[1:50:42] <@Menitta> I am great
[1:50:44] <$FuqBoiSlim> Melee walked so UNUST can run
[1:50:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> greay
[1:50:45] <+alolanslowpoke> Ah, I see
[1:50:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> welp
[1:50:52] <Silenos> Also i just found this channel in my sleepless state atm, how you boys doing tonight SeemsGood
[1:50:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> i guess i'll try to get a match in.
[1:50:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> that sucks
[1:50:57] <+RoboBro1212> SELECT AND PICK YOUR BEST ONE
[1:51:08] <CerberusDriver> EIGHT SEVEN SIX
[1:51:10] <HanPaul> is Woolie gutter trash?
[1:51:11] <+RoboBro1212> different cars PogChamp
[1:51:22] <+RoboBro1212> that's actually so much effort they didn't need to put in, I love it
[1:51:24] <%yeknomlive> ban this stage the horses are distracting me
[1:51:29] <@Menitta> yeah I suck at 3s
[1:51:29] <CalderGaming> @CerberusDriver AFAIK the 'isms kind of reduced the viable roster and playstyle?
[1:51:45] <CerberusDriver> i love alpha 3 ;_;
[1:51:45] <husbando_speedwagon> back fierce, back fierce, back fierce!
[1:51:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Alright, I've been waiting for this

[1:56:30] <%mintyrobo> Reggie Assuming Direct Control
[1:56:37] <mistersups> Just pass the stick
[1:56:40] <HanPaul> capcom lobbies LUL
[1:56:54] <husbando_speedwagon> Capcapom lobbies
[1:56:56] <@Menitta> That way they can still be in the lobby. Its not the best system but it works
[1:57:03] <%NumberTooBig> shame theres no windjammers for evo main stage... speaking of, when's windjammers
[1:57:10] <@Menitta> Yeah only one has to ready. Sorry
[1:57:26] <+RoboBro1212> windjammers 2020
[1:57:30] <+RoboBro1212> VOOT 2021
[1:57:30] <%yeknomlive> kittaaaaaa
[1:57:34] <husbando_speedwagon> Windjammers is poverty. it will never be main stage
[1:57:37] <Bazookya> you have to ready up spectator. its kinda trash
[1:57:41] <%NumberTooBig> correction actually, when's windjammers 2
[1:57:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Wack Alex WAH

[1:58:43] <CNightmare072> Curly Mustache & stuff lol
[1:58:45] <%yeknomlive> !
[1:58:48] <fireengine350> Street Fighter is one of my favorite videogames to play.
[1:58:57] <gordieda20> YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
[1:59:07] <Sk8t3> Woolie vs UNIELST 2nd gig when?
[1:59:11] <coreybom> @WoolieVersus except for Majin Obama. That brother goes in.
[1:59:13] <Silenos> Jumpy jabbu, highly technical term MVGame
[1:59:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's nothing like the feeling of not getting into the lobby to really make your night
[1:59:26] <SomersaultJustice> billy is trying to brute force the locker combo in re2
[1:59:32] <tungstenviper> TOURNEY
[1:59:36] <%NumberTooBig> @WoolieVersus PS4 i assume
[1:59:38] <@Menitta> But Pokken when tho
[2:00:00] <CalderGaming> if you can find a MTL pokken player to come on...
[2:00:01] <+RoboBro1212> also speaking of windjammers
[2:00:07] <$Punisher7771> is that some shade?
[2:00:11] <+RoboBro1212> Shot One, hopin that ends up good
[2:00:17] <+RoboBro1212> I think it might be a WJ clone
[2:00:18] <ArtThouBored> You have to search for Pokken players like actual Pokemon
[2:00:21] <@Menitta> Thats fair. Pokken is a unique game for sure
[2:00:23] <+thunderhog> the real question doh. MELTY WHEN
[2:00:25] <+senfood> Did I miss the inevitable discussion about Melee not being on the main stage at EVO?
[2:00:28] <Bazookya> again, @WoolieVersus i talked to you about Yatagarasu and PP at combocon last summer. ggs
[2:00:30] <heyitsdenzel_> "Let‘s go" - Adam West
[2:00:34] <+princessboots22> Melty blood is in the sewer water now?
[2:00:35] <%yeknomlive> pokemon direct tomorrow you never no
[2:00:41] <+Reaper102388> Arcana Heart though
[2:00:47] <%NumberTooBig> @senfood there's no discussion
[2:00:51] <ArtThouBored> It had a great run
[2:00:54] <wolvenelf> gg
[2:00:57] <%NumberTooBig> there's nothing to discuss
[2:01:00] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> It had a wonderful run. Even I can say that.
[2:01:00] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:01:00] <ArtThouBored> A better run than it deserved but hey
[2:01:00] <sodapopSquid> None of the best friends ever liked melee instead of liam so.
[2:01:03] <$Punisher7771> will ther still be a smash game?]\
[2:01:05] <zackmuffin> Look for the pokken players in the tall grass
[2:01:07] <@Menitta> yeyeye
[2:01:07] <%DedlokPM> It had a run that lasted longer than it should have, but it was indeed a good run
[2:01:08] <+msd121> Did woolie talked about the EVO lineup?
[2:01:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEEES
[2:01:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'M BACK IIIIN
[2:01:12] <CerberusDriver> smash ultimate is at EVO
[2:01:21] <%zenkiro_> YEAAAHH
[2:01:22] <Silenos> oh man, makoto is always a fun time to watch MVGame
[2:01:22] <CalderGaming> @zackmuffin lol
[2:01:22] <SenranKaguraWeeb> No guilty gear xrd is a crime
[2:01:23] <lordreginald> @Punisher7771 ultimate is gonna be on the main stage
[2:01:27] <husbando_speedwagon> Melee is the new UMVC3. Goodnight sweet prince
[2:01:34] <ArtThouBored> Jazzy NYC
[2:01:41] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> No Melee at EVO :O
[2:01:48] <+mochanekodraws> kadabuDdy
[2:01:50] <mr_miyagichu> Honestly melee is still big at smash majors so whatever
[2:01:56] <@Menitta> Oh her command grab links into Fierce
[2:01:58] <@Menitta> Neat
[2:02:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus when you're sitting in the lobby and watching the players life go down it goes pretty quick in this game jesus
[2:02:04] <tungstenviper> More space for something new...
[2:02:05] <%NumberTooBig> @husbando_speedwagon i dont think UMVC3 smells THAT bad
[2:02:08] <ManOfReason> god makoto is so sick
[2:02:25] <mr_miyagichu> NO GG XRD AT EVO @senrankaguraweeb
[2:02:29] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Am I the only one who's baffled that there's no Guilty Gear? That bbtag got sunday slot over dbfz?
[2:02:31] <shadowpunk101> oh snap its the fighting game
[2:02:31] <mr_miyagichu> ??
[2:02:38] <husbando_speedwagon> @numbertoobig Yeah, just saying that they both had good runs
[2:02:41] <mr_miyagichu> That’s ridiculous
[2:02:44] <@Menitta> woolieGASM
[2:02:52] <+cjellex> FUCK MELEE
[2:02:56] <%NumberTooBig> yeah, BBtag'
[2:02:58] <+msd121> I'm more surprised that Samurai Shodown and UNIST got in.
[2:02:58] <Silenos> @Cypher_Ranger_PhazON that is puzzling for sure, but i think it was always hard to get that be consistant
[2:03:03] <tungstenviper> GGXRD not being at EVO is straight bullshit
[2:03:07] <odd_slater> @Cypher_Ranger_PhazON You're not alone on that
[2:03:12] <mr_miyagichu> @cypher_ranger_phazon I didn’t know but now that I do I’m shocked
[2:03:15] <%NumberTooBig> does that even get htyat many entrants
[2:03:17] <%yeknomlive> "oh please dont wait for me darling"
[2:03:19] <$Punisher7771> @WoolieVersus was makoto the original wifu for you?
[2:03:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, the real question that's on everyone's mind, when's DONG DONG
[2:03:28] <$FuqBoiSlim> RIP GG BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:03:28] <CirclesForever> woaw this game looks cool, they should play this at evo
[2:03:31] <Silenos> lol for sure whens dong dong never die xD
[2:03:35] <mr_miyagichu> That sucks GG is always fun
[2:03:38] <ManfredA> Dong Dong hype
[2:03:41] <+Dovakhin573> ueien them kreygasm
[2:03:43] <Nyemmers> 3rd strike? LES FUCKIN GO
[2:03:45] <CerberusDriver> i imagine cosplaying Urien would be difficult
[2:03:47] <tacostarvedbeast> @woolieversus trance evolution ?
[2:03:51] <HanPaul> @WoolieVersus FIght of Gods when Kappa
[2:03:57] <+Reaper102388> Everyone loves the Dong Dong
[2:03:57] <$FuqBoiSlim> t
[2:03:57] <UnknownGerm> Power Metal? Power metal.
[2:04:06] <zackmuffin> @captainpiledriver the audience needs to be mentally prepared for dong dong
[2:04:08] <+cjellex> Unist and Samurai Showdown killed Melee we live in the blessed timeline
[2:04:10] <Datwiseguy> dong dong?
[2:04:10] <husbando_speedwagon> Yo this Dudley
[2:04:28] <lordreginald> i mean they said they'd be in contact with arcsys for BBCF and Xrd, so they're probably gonna do an arc revo shindig on the side at evo, and then bbtag is just on the main stage cuz it's still got content being pumped into it so they wanna generate some more hype for the $$$
[2:04:29] <Vulcan422> UNIST & SamSho baby!!
[2:04:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus @zackmuffin no, give DONG DONG raw
[2:04:32] <Silenos> well the red haired angel guy from dong dong gave me ptsd Kappa
[2:04:42] <%yeknomlive> maybe they'll announce new gg and evo BibleThump
[2:04:43] <HanPaul> there was some crazy Aegis shit at Coop this year Kreygasm
[2:04:45] <mr_miyagichu> Where can I look at the evo lineup?
[2:04:46] <%yeknomlive> at*
[2:04:48] <%oweniguess> god im so bad at wakeup dps in this game
[2:05:00] <mr_miyagichu> I missed the stream
[2:05:03] <ManOfReason> What we need is an "evo retro". Play all the early 00' stuff like mvc2 and 3s
[2:05:05] <+msd121> @WoolieVersus When's Skullgirls as a reminder it didn't get to be at the mainstage of EVO?
[2:05:10] <zackmuffin> @captainpiledriver that’s dangerous thinking. I like it
[2:05:15] <%NumberTooBig> again, there is a Guilty Gear in concept art phase because Granblue still needs to be kicked out the door
[2:05:17] <mr_miyagichu> Nvm the stream is up still
[2:05:19] <acuwa64398> SAGGOT
[2:05:21] <%Agami23> what about meltyblood?
[2:05:31] <CerberusDriver> this stage bumping around when you jump is great detail
[2:05:35] <tungstenviper> I think they switched for BlazBlue since it's made by ArcSys too...
[2:05:39] <Silenos> Skull girls is probably less likely or on same shelf as guilty gear hmm
[2:05:44] <%NumberTooBig> also DBFZ dlc but that should be too much trouble
[2:05:53] <heyitsdenzel_> Sawada is my main
[2:06:09] <%mintyrobo> henry is an unmerciful god
[2:06:11] <husbando_speedwagon> Sawada for SFV season r
[2:06:18] <husbando_speedwagon> *4
[2:06:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> GG
[2:06:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> DAMN
[2:06:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> I GET IN AS SOON AS THE KILLER IS ON THE STICK
[2:07:23] <tungstenviper> @husbando_speedwagon Police Cop Peter for SFV season 4 Kappa
[2:07:26] <HanPaul> Henry is Kreygasming super hard LUL
[2:07:41] <+SlowLikeThunder> As someone who loves UNIST today has basically been pure joy but now that I'm coming off the high I'm kinda sad that GG didn't make it
[2:07:47] <OroOreo> jjeongding has to be like the buffest tekken player i've ever seen
[2:07:50] <Bloogoose> Daigo plays Thracia, he's fucking nuts
[2:07:55] <HanPaul> those FE streams are hilarious
[2:08:01] <+kravdra> we third strike baby?
[2:08:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:08:04] <+kravdra> lets go
[2:08:06] <+msd121> UNIST has good tourney turnouts these days right? Guess that's why it's on the mainstage
[2:08:30] <+Dovakhin573> ggs
[2:08:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so with 5 games being played on saturday for there finals, how rushed is this EVO gonna be
[2:08:41] <odd_slater> UNIST has been picking up yeah
[2:08:44] <+Dovakhin573> I had to after that wakeup super
[2:08:44] <CertainlySyrix> The stuff that gets on main stage EVO is largely determined by the personal preference of the people who run it.
[2:09:01] <$Punisher7771> ok in all seriousness when i was in highschool i looked up to woolie i only wish i could be as cool as him
[2:09:09] <mr_miyagichu> Unist is main stage? What the hell is this timeline
[2:09:21] <Silenos> indeed
[2:09:23] <@Menitta> Man that color would be amazing if her hair wasnt green
[2:09:24] <ManOfReason> @Punisher7771 dont we all? Kappa
[2:09:30] <MTLxSpider> Nuki is daigos manga
[2:09:35] <MTLxSpider> he cool
[2:09:39] <HanPaul> It's Midoriya Green
[2:09:45] <+VVerewolfJones> No Pat ready to Body?
[2:09:59] <ArtThouBored> Is that Deku?
[2:10:12] <+dethdealer2> CHESTO
[2:10:13] <+msd121> @CertainlySyrix That kinda sucks because it means no matter if the community is passionate enough, it all depends on people running it if they wanna give it a chance or not.
[2:10:22] <YeezusPieces1> ggs wools
[2:10:32] <CertainlySyrix> Woolie said that on a podcast ages ago, I'm trying to remember which one.
[2:10:33] <$FuqBoiSlim> cant believe street fighter ripped off hero macadamia like that
[2:10:51] <zackmuffin> @msd121 I mean it’s also based a tourney and viewing numbers
[2:11:08] <indigoblooper> only four games on sunday this year
[2:11:10] <HanPaul> 4 games on sunday. SFV, Tekken, BBTAG, Smash
[2:11:18] <ArtThouBored> Ugh the 8am streams kill me
[2:11:25] <KeiPrime> as long as smash isnt on sunday,
[2:11:28] <+msd121> Yeah, that too, but Melee had good tourney and viewing numbers yet it got removed
[2:11:30] <KeiPrime> they can finsh on time
[2:11:31] <HanPaul> no more 8am streams LUL
[2:11:34] <$Punisher7771> @WoolieVersus i know this is not relating to the fgc but are you and pat going to do a e3 stream
[2:11:37] <CirclesForever> Is Akuma black?
[2:11:45] <+MechaBaphomet> Cant wait for SFV to drag on as long as possible
[2:11:56] <zackmuffin> @msd121 yet but it was there a long time
[2:11:59] <husbando_speedwagon> 8am vs fight game players is a 10-0 match up
[2:12:03] <CirclesForever> asking the hard questions
[2:12:12] <ArtThouBored> You know what super dragged on? Tekken 7 Arcade release
[2:12:14] <$Punisher7771> akuma the origantor of the playground gym
[2:12:19] <ArtThouBored> And the button checks took ages
[2:12:21] <+VVerewolfJones> SFV has been out for a year and a half?
[2:12:21] <Silenos> ah yes das e3, always fun to see the reactions on those
[2:12:40] <%NumberTooBig> somehow theres almost 1k viewers for unist... this is a weird day
[2:12:44] <%oweniguess> oml i missed the 2 buttons on the tele
[2:12:51] <KeiPrime> woolie wants the boss character, big surprise
[2:13:01] <SomersaultJustice> BREAKING: Woolie wants to choose the boss character
[2:13:04] <heyitsdenzel_> Snk bosses
[2:13:07] <thepiefoot> Guess i am only watching T7 top 8 and maybe check out BBTAG GF on yt later

[2:13:09] <DeadMaannn> noooo way
[2:13:19] <DeadMaannn> balancing 3s is hereseyyy
[2:13:36] <$Punisher7771> hey has any new fighting games been anounced?
[2:13:37] <ArtThouBored> Tekken has fun with those goofy nicknames
[2:13:41] <+Worsel5> The only thing I want is 2nd Impact stages in 3S
[2:13:58] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't nerf the strong, buff the weak
[2:14:08] <Datwiseguy> BUFFS ONLY BUFFS
[2:14:14] <ArtThouBored> Dark Resurrection, Bloodline Rebellion, Fated Retribution
[2:14:14] <thepiefoot> @Worsel5 Oro's cave and Alex stage Kreygasm
[2:14:17] <SomersaultJustice> I want NG and 2I win screens
[2:14:31] <CertainlySyrix> I thought Sean was nerfed because he was supposed to be a joke character in the first place.
[2:14:33] <ManOfReason> can we talk about how awesome it is that this "fighting game Renaissance" has lasted? its been like 3 years of non stop big fighting game releases
[2:14:42] <+Worsel5> @SomersaultJustice @thepiefoot *nods*

[2:15:12] <thepiefoot> Reggie got schooled
[2:15:15] <+PeaceCentennial> It's the 100 dollar Qanba stick
[2:15:20] <%yeknomlive> they have evo qanbas that have better parts
[2:15:24] <+PeaceCentennial> hey if it works for you then don't worry

[2:16:06] <+PeaceCentennial> favorite stick is still the Qanba Obsidian
[2:16:09] <+PeaceCentennial> well worth the 200
[2:16:16] <HanPaul> gotta download hella DLC too

[2:22:38] <+RoboBro1212> aren't there like 20 words pronounced "ken" in Japanese
[2:22:40] <Bazookya> @Punisher7771 i'd guess his diet is mostly being a fictional character
[2:22:43] <bazz_tv> know of the stream
[2:22:46] <+detbasil> what system is woolie playing on?
[2:22:56] <mr_miyagichu> I forget that typing emotes puts them in messages sometimes

[2:23:55] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:24:00] <bazz_tv> you already fought bot
[2:24:01] <thepiefoot> Dr. Dudders
[2:24:03] <odd_slater> SourPls
[2:24:13] <%mzrx7> PogChamp
[2:24:17] <CertainlySyrix> lab on stream
[2:24:20] <Bazookya> well shit
[2:24:22] <+MechaBaphomet> Why does the game sound so crusty?
[2:24:24] <CertainlySyrix> u know people will watch it
[2:24:31] <TaylorTot> so can we join again?
[2:24:43] <%mzrx7> @MechaBaphomet 30AC :\
[2:24:47] <%mzrx7> audio wack asf.
[2:24:52] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Sounds crusty from online delay?
[2:24:56] <thepiefoot> Akuma going ham
[2:25:02] <+MechaBaphomet> Is that just how this version sounds?
[2:25:03] <@Menitta> I do like how fast the lobby refresh in this collection is
[2:25:05] <%oweniguess> that was the best match of my life
[2:25:17] <Silenos> @Sphincter_Spelunker Well you know i only really played killer instinct on my nintendo way back in the day, so i never really got on the wagon of fighter games it wasnt untill later i really started looking again after tekken and some things.
[2:25:18] <%oweniguess> GGs woolie!
[2:25:28] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> where's my joycon street fighters at
[2:25:37] <%Billyuppercut0> Ayy
[2:25:37] <Pannkko> @WoolieVersus will you guys play karate foolish
[2:26:24] <%Billyuppercut0> Churning Butter with Joy Cons is tough
[2:26:29] <nerdblase> Needs more Q.
[2:26:39] <CerberusDriver> i got sf 30th on switch, im ok with joycons
[2:26:41] <+Dovakhin573> I got you
[2:26:42] <Silenos> takes a great deal of commitment to git gud at games like this
[2:26:59] <husbando_speedwagon> @woolieversus Yo man, still no UMVC3. Come on.
[2:27:00] <Bazookya> 3s on joycons sounds like a goddamn nightmare
[2:27:01] <%Billyuppercut0> Honestly I just go for the grapplers
[2:27:10] <%Billyuppercut0> That’s my jam
[2:27:15] <%oweniguess> the switch version has really bad netcode, i regret buying it
[2:27:20] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeah man, i only ever got exposed to 3d fighters as a kid, so now i'm hopeless when it comes to 3d fighters
[2:27:33] <gnarly_memes_bro> 2d i mean hopeless in 2d
[2:27:44] <thepiefoot> 3s on the joycon sounds as bad as pressing start button to get medium buttons
[2:27:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Silenos I was invested when the arcades were dying off, and no one but killers were left. So I got 1 game in IF I was lucky. 3s and a couple Marvel games have always held a special place to me.
[2:27:44] <cajjunb> I'm the opposite I played only 3d fighters
[2:27:45] <Kefkaisnotamused> YOOOOO
[2:27:52] <$FuqBoiSlim> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:28:03] <CirclesForever> has there been a fighting game that used motion controls? pvp wii sport boxing?
[2:28:11] <CertainlySyrix> ARMS?
[2:28:16] <$FuqBoiSlim> ARMS

[2:29:56] <Silenos> ooo neato a new charecter
[2:29:59] <gnarly_memes_bro> everyone start practicing phoenix wright so we he can losr all hope when he does do mvc
[2:30:00] <Kefkaisnotamused> Proto-G is the best character ever.

[2:30:21] <%Billyuppercut0> I really hope the new character is Noob

[2:30:36] <cajjunb> @WoolieVersus If you have some things written down it might be easier to get back in
[2:31:01] <SomersaultJustice> It's Super Tuesday!
[2:31:03] <Kefkaisnotamused> New character is probably someone obvious like Johnny Cage.
[2:31:05] <ArtThouBored> I expect Johnny but I hope I get Kotal instead. Really liked his Sun God/War God Gameplay
[2:31:08] <Wofoeh> Most people do, but they’ll probably reveal someone more obvious, like Kitana, maybe a new one, or even Kotal
[2:31:10] <gnarly_memes_bro> @thepiefoot ooo that would be tasty.
[2:31:16] <ArtThouBored> Blood God was gimmicky fun lol
[2:31:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i'm gonna be a drone here and i'm gonna say when's DONG DONG NEVER DIES
[2:31:31] <Silenos> yea, it helps with notes and recording performance etc to really up your game... but thats only for serious players MVGame

[2:53:21] <%NumberTooBig> @yeknomlive woolz told the storyy somewhere
[2:53:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus LOOK OUT people are leaving the stream cause chun li is on screen in Third Strike
[2:53:43] <@Menitta> I wish they'd port KOFXI
[2:53:48] <+berserkscarlett> JOJO...Arc Systems.... the dream...

[2:54:15] <%oweniguess> dont make me face this chunners oh lort
[2:54:16] <YeezusPieces1> I would love a HttF night
[2:54:18] <Slasher9485> Chun Li is the most powerful character in the game
[2:54:20] <thepiefoot> The worst part of 3s Chun is that sweep animation. YUCK
[2:54:21] <CertainlySyrix> arcsys made a Sailor Moon game once
[2:54:25] <tacostarvedbeast> I love that people just call her chunners
[2:54:26] <Datwiseguy> yo crack the neck chun?
[2:54:26] <Kefkaisnotamused> Yep. Chun Li. Unfollow, unsubscribe, report to the government.
[2:54:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i see chun and i literally just leave the house
[2:54:36] <%NumberTooBig> would the P4A team or french bread be better for a jojo game, because HftF really feels like an snk game... because it kinda is LUL
[2:54:37] <Silenos> xD
[2:54:37] <CirclesForever> In many ways, Chun Li is the main character of fighting streets
[2:54:38] <gnarly_memes_bro> honestly I'd be happy with ArcSys getting any other anime licenses
[2:54:39] <Datwiseguy> yo the table
[2:54:40] <Slasher9485> To the point her old tourny nick name was "The BEYOTCH"
[2:54:41] <cajjunb> at least is not blanka
[2:54:41] <%yeknomlive> @WoolieVersus are there any hnk pro's in the area that can show us some shit
[2:54:43] <Datwiseguy> use the table
[2:54:45] <cajjunb> it could be worse
[2:54:49] <CertainlySyrix> Chun Li is the main antagonist of Third Strike
[2:54:50] <Mythundare> this stream needs more borders

[3:15:27] <heyitsdenzel_> He does machines
[3:15:27] <%UrsulaCat> Or dudette
[3:15:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Raphael is the only right answer. Donnies aight, but We can all agree Leos a lame

[3:15:46] <mistersups> If only a beast like me could make people happy~
[3:15:49] <SomersaultJustice> they should play nes tournament fighter
[3:15:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we all just agree Leo is trash
[3:15:57] <gnarly_memes_bro> any choice besides leo is valid
[3:16:00] <tacostarvedbeast> Donny in the top 3 for sure
[3:16:01] <husbando_speedwagon> TMNT tournament fighters has the best move names! PERIOD
[3:16:02] <%shmupdogjoe> There wouldn't be so much War
[3:16:09] <Silenos> Id like to see some good old killer instinct 1 MVGame
[3:16:12] <ArtThouBored> Mikey = Raphael > Donnie > Leo > Venus deMilo
[3:16:12] <%UrsulaCat> I’ve only lived through the latter 90s but I know the lingo
[3:16:13] <TheLeoShmeo> r i s i n g t h u n d e r
[3:16:17] <moogleboy1984> the jiggle physics on Baxter Stockman
[3:16:32] <Pookiedaexzile> WOah woah woah We all know Venus comes after Spike
[3:16:35] <Vendigear> we know about the EVO lineup announcement in here, right?
[3:16:38] <heyitsdenzel_> Poppin mad bonners
[3:16:44] <CalderGaming> waitaminute this isn't yatagarasu
[3:16:47] <Quikanims> why does everyone hate Leo?
[3:16:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Spike actually beats Leo in love
[3:16:58] <ArtThouBored> It's not that I hate Leo I just like him the least
[3:17:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Because he's cyclops
[3:17:07] <Quikanims> all turtles deserve love
[3:17:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Nobody likes Cyclops
[3:17:17] <CirclesForever> I had a teenage mutant hero turtles vhs tape when I was a kid
[3:17:19] <moogleboy1984> the CPU can not deal with Aska's butt bounce
[3:17:23] <Cpt_phantom> Leo is so plain, it's not hate
[3:17:24] <NicLuvin> doodLewd
[3:17:33] <%UrsulaCat> Orange=Purple>blue>red for me personally
[3:17:35] <gnarly_memes_bro> leo is fine but not worth being anyones favorite turtle when the others have actual personality
[3:17:36] <Quikanims> @pookiedaexzile don't you ever insult Leo like that ever again
[3:17:39] <heyitsdenzel_> Chicago Bulls
[3:17:39] <%yeknomlive> oh yeah wasnt aska core valued in the na release of this?
[3:17:47] <ArtThouBored> Nobody hates Leo but the few who remember Venus hate her
[3:17:58] <%UrsulaCat> I’m not into fightman as a personality
[3:18:05] <Vendigear> @woolieversus What is your opinion on the EVO lineup announcement?
[3:18:13] <%UrsulaCat> Which is red again
[3:18:16] <ArtThouBored> She's the scrappy doo of the Turtles If I recall right
[3:18:16] <+Parrish_broadnax> The heck was that Contra
[3:18:37] <Floofiie> SKULLGIRLS GOT CORE VALUED
[3:18:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:18:48] <+blackkanye> At least we got UNIST
[3:18:51] <NicLuvin> Guilty Gear died so we could have UNIST
[3:18:53] <Laironx3> Did you just make a Chewbacca noise?
[3:18:54] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I feel worse for Rev 2 @WoolieVersus
[3:18:59] <Vendigear> skullgirls always gets CORE VALUED
[3:19:03] <+FrostNinjutsu> New Samurai Spirits teaser trailer out PogChamp
[3:19:04] <ArtThouBored> Tekken 7 did the same thing
[3:19:09] <SpookyBeef7> Games have been getting announced for EVO before release ever since Street Fighter x Tekken.
[3:19:11] <Josef_Stryker> Skullgirls got fucking robbed
[3:19:16] <gnarly_memes_bro> Skullgirls died on the cross for BBctb and Samurai Showdown
[3:19:17] <Pookiedaexzile> @Quikanims Obbsessed with the older leader, loves redheads, overly pushy with the cool loner member of the team, Blames everyone for his failures. Leo=Cyclops
[3:19:23] <SpookyBeef7> It's all about who is willing to give Mr. Wizard enough money.
[3:19:28] <Vendigear> skullgirls never had a chance
[3:19:36] <TheGershon> Woolie likes dome
[3:19:42] <SpookyBeef7> But Melee is also dead, so I'm okay with the lineup.
[3:19:43] <husbando_speedwagon> Mike Z is crying again
[3:19:53] <CirclesForever> raphy has fire powers because the real raphael burned himself trying to cook
[3:19:54] <%UrsulaCat> I’m the oldest sibling so I sympathize with blue mask
[3:19:54] <ArtThouBored> Sure you can say it's murky because Arcade Release but I think that sucks for the players who never had an arcade or a way to travel to one
[3:20:01] <heyitsdenzel_> Charge down the up?
[3:20:05] <+Ornightz> LETS KICK SHELL!!
[3:20:05] <+blackkanye> Guilty Gear took down Melee so UNIST may thrive
[3:20:05] <%UrsulaCat> Who is blue again
[3:20:10] <NicLuvin> Those salty melee fans on twitter LUL
[3:20:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Skullgirls shoulda did what the big companies do, and slipped evo dat check
[3:20:23] <+ChrisAlgoo> Leonardo is blue
[3:20:30] <mistersups> WingNut
[3:20:35] <CirclesForever> slipped evo that quick dick
[3:20:40] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeah i'm glad melee is gone. i don't hate it, but the logic that kept it there should ahve also got 3S on main stage so it was always bogus IMO
[3:20:42] <Vulcan422> This stage music tho
[3:20:50] <Pookiedaexzile> You slip them that check you getting in
[3:20:56] <%UrsulaCat> But I love orange and purple cause they have for real personality and flaws and joaks
[3:21:08] <%UrsulaCat> Joaks and croaks
[3:21:09] <CirclesForever> slip them that dick, you get whatever you want
[3:21:12] <+nakunattakage> Thanks for the great Tuesday night vibes everyone <3
[3:21:25] <+blackkanye> THey could play the community tournament stuff they are doing well if they take advantage. Depending on how it works
[3:21:26] <Laironx3> Yummie Yomi
[3:21:32] <husbando_speedwagon> Just Mr Wiz a McRib and you'll get your game in
[3:21:40] <Quikanims> @pookiedaexzile except unlike Cyclops Leo actually backs up his lecturing. Leo didn't get the top by just having plot glasses, he worked the hardest and dedicated himself the most
[3:21:52] <%UrsulaCat> @circlesforever stop spreading rumors about me lol
[3:22:06] <heyitsdenzel_> Wingnut has a demon
[3:22:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Um excuse me....but Leo is the best leader....not the best fighter
[3:22:12] <+ChrisAlgoo> speaking of yomi when's fantasy strike (jk)
[3:22:27] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Speaking of Fantasy Strike, when's Yomi?
[3:22:33] <CirclesForever> @UrsulaCat ok
[3:23:03] <Quikanims> all turtles are the best
[3:23:15] <Quikanims> but Mikey is just the bestest
[3:23:16] <%UrsulaCat> The joke being I too crave the di
[3:23:16] <+Parrish_broadnax> "how do I approach ?" Go home
[3:23:40] <CirclesForever> the girl turtle from the movie was the best, she had a pink bandana and breasts
[3:23:41] <ArtThouBored> Leo isn't as cunty as Cyclops
[3:23:43] <+Some_guy92> The colors in this game popped so good Kreygasm
[3:23:49] <Pookiedaexzile> I mean mikeys everyones favorite....when they're twelve
[3:23:50] <tacostarvedbeast> Stronger that omega Tom Hanks?
[3:23:53] <ArtThouBored> At least Leo can have fun with his brothers
[3:24:04] <%UrsulaCat> Leo is cooler than Raph
[3:24:08] <ArtThouBored> Cyclops doesn't know the concept of fun that doesn't involve JEAAAAAN
[3:24:21] <Pookiedaexzile> @ArtThouBored Imma need citation
[3:24:28] <Splatterfest> Raph is the only turtle worth mentioning
[3:24:29] <CirclesForever> mikey is the orangest, and the coolest
[3:24:32] <+ChrisAlgoo> cyclops is cool in the leather jacket and at no other times
[3:24:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Ursula
[3:24:37] <Quikanims> @pookiedaexzile if being 12 means being right, then so be it
[3:24:43] <ArtThouBored> Name one time Scott acted like a normal person and not a a robot
[3:24:52] <ArtThouBored> And no banging Emma doesn't count
[3:24:55] <Pookiedaexzile> @UrsulaCat Imma need citation
[3:25:00] <%UrsulaCat> I don’t like violentdude as a personality
[3:25:15] <%UrsulaCat> Just personelly
[3:25:15] <Pookiedaexzile> He's a senstive artist
[3:25:25] <Pookiedaexzile> of stabbing
[3:25:35] <+Ecchigun> LOL
[3:25:47] <+ChrisAlgoo> damn shredder thicc
[3:25:47] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:25:49] <+Some_guy92> GET SHREDDED
[3:25:58] <%UrsulaCat> Stabmam is not a substitute for personality
[3:26:24] <+preppyposs> did woolie talk about evo lineup?
[3:26:29] <%UrsulaCat> Yes
[3:26:32] <Pookiedaexzile> He's senstive, and he cares deeply for his boys. He also makes friends with more outsiders than any other turtle
[3:26:52] <Pookiedaexzile> He finds Slash
[3:26:58] <Laironx3> The Street Shark legacy goes on
[3:27:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Casey Jones
[3:27:11] <%UrsulaCat> HE WRITES SLASH??
[3:27:14] <ArtThouBored> lol
[3:27:17] <ArtThouBored> fucking lmao
[3:27:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Also I will fight anyone who says Streak any the best Street shark
[3:27:33] <APB_Harleqyn> @WoolieVersus would that make it a tiger-shark uppercut ??????
[3:27:39] <Pookiedaexzile> S....slash the fifth ninja turtle
[3:27:42] <moogleboy1984> the runback PogChamp
[3:27:46] <CirclesForever> isn't Michaelangelo canonically the strongest?
[3:27:51] <%UrsulaCat> Okay then I don’t care
[3:27:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats a lie from a forum
[3:27:58] <nobody12349> I'm hopelessly crossing my fingers for TMNT: Mutant Melee
[3:28:09] <ArtThouBored> Mikey is super good when he gets serious
[3:28:18] <moogleboy1984> When's Eternal Champions?
[3:28:21] <tacostarvedbeast> @woolieversus ready to take TMNT online ?
[3:28:23] <ArtThouBored> Spiderman?
[3:28:34] <+Ecchigun> ROBBERY
[3:28:39] <Laironx3> Justice will prevail... JK
[3:28:42] <%UrsulaCat> Michaelangelo is the shaggy so obviously he’s the strongest
[3:28:43] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Reggie's inner Australian coming out?
[3:28:48] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> "YOU WANKA"
[3:28:50] <%mister_rogers> is this really being played on a snes
[3:29:09] <+Some_guy92> I had it on snes
[3:29:17] <nobody12349> Why is Casey not in this but a discount street shark is?
[3:29:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Saving the best for last
[3:29:40] <HanPaul> pick April
[3:30:03] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Was Casey in the series at the time of this game coming out? @nobody12349
[3:30:14] <CirclesForever> what was the first fictional ninja brigade, the Foot or the Hand
[3:30:22] <+Link2448> doodBenny
[3:30:24] <+cahv123> Leo's super is so much better than raph's.
[3:30:30] <Pookiedaexzile> The Foot is a paraody of the Hand
[3:30:37] <nobody12349> @Kung_Fu_KaiTV They said he's in the shitty genesis version of this game
[3:30:49] <%shmupdogjoe> ^ Turtles basically started as a send-up of Frank Miller daredevil
[3:30:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Ninja Turtles was a paraody of grimdark 80s comics
[3:30:51] <nobody12349> Also Casey Jones transcends time
[3:31:02] <%shmupdogjoe> see the joke is that turtles are not known for their agility or stealth, so make them ninjas
[3:31:22] <%UrsulaCat> Nice my message wasn’t sent because I said the w word
[3:31:28] <CirclesForever> thats a funny joke
[3:31:28] <nobody12349> I thought the joke was that turtles look funny if you put masks on them
[3:31:42] <husbando_speedwagon> Rolento jab
[3:31:44] <Pookiedaexzile> No the joke is that green is a bad color for a ninja
[3:31:50] <CirclesForever> @UrsulaCat well you shouldnt call peopple rude names then
[3:31:55] <nobody12349> @UrsulaCat Mrs. Obama is saved once again
[3:32:07] <+Link2448> lol
[3:32:11] <%UrsulaCat> My parents (both deeply American) say the w word but only as a joke insult
[3:32:13] <Parapattern> "Mrs. Obama, it's been an honor"
[3:32:35] <+Link2448> Idek what the w word refers to

[3:33:49] <%shmupdogjoe> I think the way better joke was when Mirage did Toxic Crusaders. Between that and getting my dad to get me black and white Turtles comics, like my whole childhood is a joke at my parents' expense
[3:33:50] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> !MOTIVATED
[3:33:50] <@Moobot> 173 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[3:34:07] <%UrsulaCat> Noooo wank isn’t a verb it’s a joke insult my parents use. No other meaning lalala I can’t hear you
[3:34:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh shit boys we gotta meme on our hands
[3:34:32] <nobody12349> @Pookiedaexzile What have you brought upon this cursed land?
[3:34:40] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Pookiedaexzile thats a pretty good meme m80 not gonna lie
[3:34:53] <%shmupdogjoe> wanker test
[3:34:55] <%shmupdogjoe> hm
[3:35:01] <%shmupdogjoe> Was that the wrong w word
[3:35:09] <%UrsulaCat> I’ve never seen m80 that’s cute
[3:35:31] <%UrsulaCat> Maybe it was context? Shmupdogjoe
[3:35:39] <nobody12349> w. NUT
[3:36:20] <%UrsulaCat> Does the chat wanna assassinate me for saying wanker
[3:36:31] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> OBAMA
[3:36:35] <%UrsulaCat> So yeah just something weird
[3:36:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Styling Demon killing Mortals....Demons but just half breeds... Pizza powwer
[3:36:53] <gnarly_memes_bro> I think we're just attempting to learn the limits of the supposed anti-wankery
[3:36:59] <Josef_Stryker> LAMED OUT
[3:37:13] <gnarly_memes_bro> thats where i'm coming from at least
[3:37:18] <%UrsulaCat> No this is a stupid thing to learn @gnarly_memes_bro
[3:37:24] <Laironx3> Can you do combo?
[3:37:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Devil May cry is Ninja Turtle Fan fiction where Mikey goes off and becomes cool and Leo secrectly was Raphs dad
[3:37:31] <husbando_speedwagon> Nice
[3:37:32] <%UrsulaCat> Even stupider than going to art school
[3:37:34] <%shmupdogjoe> That's Leo's distance!
[3:37:48] <gnarly_memes_bro> good point, i'll deal with it when its becomes relevant
[3:37:50] <nobody12349> Did Leo just T-pose?
[3:37:52] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> PJSalt
[3:37:57] <CertainlySyrix> NotLikeThis
[3:37:57] <Pookiedaexzile> It even has gay overtones.....what have I done
[3:38:01] <CirclesForever> in real life, the turtle would stab the bat to death very early in the fight
[3:38:10] <gnarly_memes_bro> OOH THAT BAT SPLIT THO
[3:38:13] <CirclesForever> he would bleed out
[3:38:22] <%Sunditsu> NotLikeThis PJSalt NotLikeThis
[3:38:23] <nobody12349> @CirclesForever In real life, turtles can't hold weapons
[3:38:27] <%UrsulaCat> It ain’t good if there’s no homoerotic overtones
[3:38:44] <CirclesForever> @nobody12349 no
[3:39:04] <gnarly_memes_bro> in real life turtles ARE weapons, if you have the balls
[3:39:07] <nobody12349> Well, I'm convinced
[3:39:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Devil May Cry is Just Ninja Turtles Slash Fic. April is Trish and Karai is Lady
[3:39:34] <gnarly_memes_bro> pookie this may be getting out of hand
[3:39:51] <nobody12349> @Pookiedaexzile April looks like Mikey's mom?

[3:39:52] <gnarly_memes_bro> lets keep going
[3:39:52] <%UrsulaCat> Does raph write slash fic in your fic
[3:39:53] <%shmupdogjoe> I really hate the way that they made Raphael a guest character in Soul Calibur but then he's from some weird fanfiction version where Raph is a French fencer guy and sometimes a vampire
[3:39:59] <keiji_maede> lmfao!!
[3:40:03] <xeros720> QUIT MAKING THIS LOOK COOL
[3:40:04] <Laironx3> Good thing I have headphones
[3:40:14] <pillowwasp> Is this evo grand finals?
[3:40:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Karai wants to kill her father like Lady
[3:40:36] <Pookiedaexzile> And Mikey does have mommy problems in a couple versions
[3:40:38] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie PLEASE make more of those noises
[3:40:38] <nobody12349> Wait am I lady?
[3:40:40] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> WingNUT Kreygasm
[3:40:49] <%Sunditsu> Zoning NUT LUL
[3:40:53] <blackorchidKI2> @shmupdogjoe ...What?
[3:41:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Japan stole our Ninja comics for their Satanic vidya
[3:41:02] <LaloDeLaSoul> glad i got to see woolie's nut
[3:41:26] <Laironx3> Practice your Footsie nut tech
[3:41:38] <husbando_speedwagon> Yo that uppercut is sick
[3:41:47] <LaloDeLaSoul> woolie's nut flying from above
[3:41:48] <%shmupdogjoe> @blackorchidKI2 any joke you have to explain... Nevermind
[3:41:50] <nobody12349> @Pookiedaexzile I don't think it's 1 to 1 tho. Seeing as Leo actually acts responsible for Raphael.
[3:41:57] <+ProjectRonin> what it do @WoolieVersus !
[3:42:08] <$KnivesEve> is that a street shark!
[3:42:15] <%UrsulaCat> “Fighting games are all I know I blah blah all my life but... I’m ass dawg. I’m garbage”
[3:42:34] <CirclesForever> in real life, the shark would die as fish are allergic to oxygen
[3:42:41] <%shmupdogjoe> See what I did there is there's a character called Raphael in Soul Calibur and I just pretended the only relevant Raphael in pop culture is the ninja turtle
[3:43:01] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I can barely do motions on pad, it sucks. @WoolieVersus
[3:43:03] <blackorchidKI2> I got it.
[3:43:08] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I think I should buy a Qanba Drone.
[3:43:11] <%UrsulaCat> In reality humans would win because they have tools
[3:43:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Leo would never take care of his love child esspecially if it was Raph
[3:43:32] <pillowwasp> King crimson is having a lag switch on halo 2
[3:43:39] <%shmupdogjoe> But a shark with hand can also use tools, erasing the human advantage
[3:43:43] <%shmupdogjoe> *hands
[3:43:55] <Bloogoose> Reggie isn't allowed to come back if he loses this match
[3:43:56] <%yeknomlive> did he learn armgon's divekick
[3:43:59] <nobody12349> All pop culture instances of someone named "Raphael" are replaced by the painter. Which series does he die first in?
[3:44:00] <%UrsulaCat> Yeah but in real life
[3:44:14] <gnarly_memes_bro> @pillowwasp yeah wow calling CC a lag switch is a pretty easy way to sum it up without getting complex about it
[3:44:15] <Pookiedaexzile> He dies of Radiation
[3:44:16] <CirclesForever> a shark with hands would be unstoppable, he would punch you in the nose
[3:44:17] <%UrsulaCat> DO NOT KICK OUT REGGIE
[3:44:27] <%UrsulaCat> REGGIE IS A SWEET MAN
[3:44:27] <Bloogoose> Fraud Detection Warning
[3:44:38] <%shmupdogjoe> In real life a shark with hands and who can survive out of water would be the scariest thing ever
[3:44:45] <PlayWithTheJ> Reggie, it's not worth dying on this hill.
[3:44:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie over here looking like Roman Reigns cancer Cells.....beat
[3:45:00] <nobody12349> @shmupdogjoe There's something scarier
[3:45:02] <Laironx3> Now that's a real Wing Nut character at the background
[3:45:07] <nobody12349> That shark...
[3:45:08] <Bloogoose> FRAUD DETECTED

[3:46:10] <+kingoftuesdaynight> Reggie forgot the number one rule: If you lose in the game you lose in real life

[3:46:50] <nobody12349> Reggie, girls weren't watching. You're fine
[3:46:53] <%yeknomlive> this is insanity

[3:50:35] <%UrsulaCat> My feet are cold under blanket
[3:50:37] <CirclesForever> do furries like the ninja turtles?
[3:50:40] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Karai for smash
[3:50:49] <%UrsulaCat> Some do @circlesforever
[3:50:54] <+kingoftuesdaynight> @CirclesForever no, children do Kappa
[3:51:17] <CirclesForever> if i was a furry, my fursona could be a turtle
[3:51:20] <nobody12349> @CirclesForever The more important question is... do the ninja turtles like furries?
[3:51:25] <%Manofsalt> doodOne doodOne
[3:51:37] <%UrsulaCat> Turtles are furry allies
[3:51:39] <%PlumpPotatoRump> o.m.g
[3:51:42] <CirclesForever> @nobody12349 nobody likes furries
[3:51:44] <%yeknomlive> my god
[3:51:57] <%NumberTooBig> i believe the term is scalies, Peach would know
[3:51:58] <nzolozabal> @CirclesForever Not furry then. Scaley.
[3:51:58] <%yeknomlive> that dp did sf1 lvl damage
[3:51:59] <%PlumpPotatoRump> loool
[3:52:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Where would we be as a species without furryism?
[3:52:07] <gnarly_memes_bro> If I were a furry I'd be a salmon, so I could sell my own roe until I got arrested by the FBI for crimes against fish kind
[3:52:12] <Setnom> dood3S
[3:52:19] <GypsySquid> This game was a huge part of my childhood.
[3:52:28] <%UrsulaCat> Pre-ancient Egyptian that’s for sure
[3:52:32] <%NumberTooBig> anyone else see that movie about a guy who wants to be a Lobster Kappa
[3:52:35] <GypsySquid> Karai can suck a dick, though.
[3:52:39] <CirclesForever> wingnut i a furry icon
[3:52:48] <nobody12349> Wait what are furries called that are into things without fur/scales?
[3:52:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine becoming a furry for turtles.....its like becoming a street racer and choosing a pinto
[3:52:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Nelly is a furrylord
[3:53:13] <%UrsulaCat> Featheries
[3:53:18] <%yeknomlive> dat body splash
[3:53:32] <%UrsulaCat> And I think dolphin furries are just called furries
[3:53:34] <Lark991> @NumberTooBig You mean The Lobster? and yes Dry ass British Humor
[3:53:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Pookiedaexzile Turtles have massive junk and have sex for a LONG time
[3:53:46] <xeros720> Teenage Mutant Ninja Frauds
[3:53:47] <gnarly_memes_bro> and they squeak
[3:53:57] <CirclesForever> imagine is bebop and rocksteady were furries, but there fursonas were snow leopards
[3:53:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:53:58] <tacostarvedbeast> @WoolieVersus dats a good shirt
[3:54:01] <%NumberTooBig> hey, @WoolieVersus do you like turtles yet?
[3:54:06] <%UrsulaCat> Furry is an umbrella term
[3:54:07] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> FIRST TO 5AM LUL
[3:54:28] <+kingoftuesdaynight> It's first to 2 AM here, cause that's when the arcade starts kicking you out.
[3:54:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Then there is sitting in the corner and using Flashkick
[3:55:22] <%PlumpPotatoRump> games and characters too :o
[3:55:39] <%UrsulaCat> I’m dying now goodbye
[3:55:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Goodbye dying now
[3:55:55] <%UrsulaCat> See you in the lack of afterlife
[3:56:01] <%PlumpPotatoRump> byeee
[3:56:02] <Pookiedaexzile> First to 10 is the only way I like to play
[3:56:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Its Chess
[3:56:18] <gnarly_memes_bro> man I wish my RL friends would play fight games with me, they all just make excuses about not wanting to take the time to get decent when im not even good
[3:56:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> First to stabbed is the real shit though
[3:56:26] <Pookiedaexzile> it gives you the ability to hide tech
[3:56:42] <Pookiedaexzile> I got match 3 tech versus my match 7 tech
[3:56:55] <%yeknomlive> ggs
[3:57:24] <%UrsulaCat> Sorry I said I was going but @gnarly_memes_bro maybe they just don’t wanna play that game with you
[3:57:37] <nobody12349> Being mediocre at fight games is a curse. You can't play with people who don't really play the game and you get blown the fuck out by people who do.
[3:57:53] <gnarly_memes_bro> i mean they dont wanna play the game period
[3:57:59] <%yeknomlive> BibleThump
[3:58:09] <gnarly_memes_bro> i have other friends who play fgs and the same guys refuse them too
[3:58:25] <%SanguineQuest> "Give your Twitch Prime to this guy," DONE AND DONE
[3:58:35] <%PlumpPotatoRump> take my powaaahhh \o/
[3:58:38] <%UrsulaCat> So don’t force your friends to play a game they don’t like
[3:58:40] <%yeknomlive> anyone want a sub?
[3:58:48] <gnarly_memes_bro> we just have a bubble of bitch boys here is all LUL LUL i kid, they just wont even give it a chance is my issue
[3:59:04] <tacostarvedbeast> time to wear that head band again woolie
[3:59:04] <nobody12349> If they like other co-op games, invite them to play those and surprise them with third strike. Lock the door fast.
[3:59:13] <gnarly_memes_bro> @UrsulaCat how do you know you don't like a game you literally refuse to touch tho?
[3:59:15] <Joysta> <3 hrpgLoveyousortof <3 hrpgLoveyousortof <3
[3:59:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Give your Twitch prime to Woolie??!?! Nah.. thats like Engagement proposal
[3:59:20] <%PlumpPotatoRump> woolieMIRIN woolieF woolieU
[3:59:22] <%SanguineQuest> The Great Naruto Bridge of the FGC is a fantastic nom de gurre
[3:59:26] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> "It just works"
[3:59:28] <CirclesForever> @WoolieVersus dont thank me im just a shitposter
[3:59:38] <%UrsulaCat> I know I’m shit at fast paced versus video games
[3:59:38] <CalderGaming> it's like The Hand but for time, figure out the rest yourself
[3:59:54] <%NumberTooBig> @WoolieVersus so... the Skullgirls launch party is still going on, thinking of streaming it
[3:59:55] <%UrsulaCat> I don’t have to play every fighting game to know
[4:00:14] <Pookiedaexzile> I suck at 2d fighters
[4:00:20] <gnarly_memes_bro> what im saying is my friends flat refuse to even try fight games and it bugs me when i concede to them and play shit i dont care about like table tops
[4:00:21] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm only a 3d guy
[4:00:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> play something calm and soothing like Blackout Online
[4:00:35] <gnarly_memes_bro> its a situational issue
[4:00:43] <nobody12349> King Crimson makes new rules and breaks them at such frequency that you'd think that that's it's true ability.
[4:00:46] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> 10 DAYS LADS
[4:00:48] <%UrsulaCat> Play versus tabletops. Compromise you fucc
[4:00:55] <%shmupdogjoe> Holy shit, tabletop wargaming is *not* a thing you do just to concede to your friends. Way too expensive.
[4:01:00] <Pookiedaexzile> If they like Tablet Tops try Soul Calibur
[4:01:00] <Laironx3> King Crimson forces everyone into zoning out DarkMode

[4:07:54] <%UrsulaCat> Konami
[4:07:57] <%UrsulaCat> You know.
[4:07:57] <%SanguineQuest> They made a MGS3 Pachinko Machine
[4:07:58] <+Deutschlander_Jak> Boss is in the Pachinko machine
[4:08:01] <%UrsulaCat> Konami
[4:08:01] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games

[4:08:14] <Josef_Stryker> BACK TO THE TRASH
[4:08:15] <Pookiedaexzile> I know they fired the only thing that made them relevant
[4:08:15] <%SanguineQuest> It's the worst thing that ever happened to man
[4:08:16] <nobody12349> Didn't you know? The Boss was a huge fan of Pachinko.
[4:08:23] <nobody12349> REAL GARBAGE
[4:08:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Did they stoop so low
[4:08:37] <+PenGia> Yeah, like back in 2016
[4:08:42] <%SanguineQuest> Bunnyhop did a video where he tracked down the machine and played it, go check his channel
[4:08:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait wut
[4:08:49] <%SanguineQuest> It's even more horrifying than you think
[4:08:54] <%shmupdogjoe> This ending hurts me in a way I can't quite explain
[4:08:54] <spacecatstreams> just starting?
[4:08:57] <%UrsulaCat> Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
[4:08:59] <Josef_Stryker> G'Night Fuckers!

[4:09:03] <Pookiedaexzile> How did I miss this.....Oh yeah I don't give a fuck about pachinko
[4:09:04] <Laironx3> byu
[4:09:14] <%shmupdogjoe> Sleep tight, chucklefuck!
[4:09:20] <nobody12349> @spacecatstreams The opposite.
[4:09:22] <+Deutschlander_Jak> Pookie, why you throwin shade at pachinko?
[4:09:23] <%SanguineQuest> In fact, at the risk of being a shill, watch ALL of Bunnyhop's channel, it owns
[4:09:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Pachinko is throwing shade at Metal gear
[4:09:47] <+Deutschlander_Jak> SuperBunnyHop has all the hypest pachinko action
[4:09:49] <%UrsulaCat> Don’t you know the boss loves pachinko
[4:09:53] <nobody12349> @SanguineQuest and then unsubscribe from him
[4:09:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Now off to mustard town
[4:10:02] <%UrsulaCat> And wants you to play it
[4:10:12] <%shmupdogjoe> In fact, sleep tight *all* you chucklefucks. I am going to bed as well.
[4:10:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Ursula I'm trying to be cool here. but if you say that shit about boss 1 more time and I will go Pyscho Mantis
[4:10:35] <Pookiedaexzile> and I don't mean the kid version
[4:10:54] <Pookiedaexzile> That somehow is more powerful as a child
