[0:15:55] <+Gespens> Trigger ResidentSleeper
[0:15:56] <+Proxzo> animating 101 characters on screen?
[0:15:57] <+Weeewer> Bakana!!!!
[0:15:58] <BreakersAweigh> me niether

[0:16:08] <Jadorsonething> Has nintendo even licensed any anime recently anyway?
[0:16:08] <+Weeewer> I just want W101 on switch so I can fucking play it...
[0:16:08] <+Camail> 101 is an anime already
[0:16:09] <Man_in_the_Red> @proxzo it'll animate like water
[0:16:10] <%GohanEgret> 101 is already anime
[0:16:10] <cthulhu_senpai_> D:
[0:16:11] <NeroInfinite> We don't need an anime of W101
[0:16:15] <TechTurtle7> fuck the anime give me switch port
[0:16:18] <zedravan> give it to toei LUL
[0:16:19] <@Menitta> I remember someone saying Studio Trigger should do Ace Attorney. Like....no
[0:16:20] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Yes we do. I hate the gameplay.
[0:16:22] <+Javaa01> Oh, I guess I should mention this in case it hasn't been brought up, if you're having a hard time reading the rules of a level, you should be able to get a clear readout of them if you pause the game
[0:16:22] <+Proxzo> It succeeds as a game
[0:16:24] <TrashLeviathan> give us w102
[0:16:27] <+EndgameContent> Woolie gets it!
[0:16:28] <Laironx3> Use Unite Guts in the playthru goddamit
[0:16:28] <KingOfTheGeats> same reason why we don't need an anime of Asura's Wrath
[0:16:30] <+Gespens> Make it a live action Tokusatsu
[0:16:33] <Man_in_the_Red> put Mad House on it, thay already did Devil May Cry Kappa
[0:16:35] <$The_Cassowary> Woolie,, thoughts on Code Vein? The anime of Souls
[0:16:35] <+Proxzo> agreeeed
[0:16:41] <%ChoculaUltra> people still fuck with Trigger after Franxx?? crazy.
[0:16:46] <Laironx3> Use it more I mean
[0:16:51] <+Taglog7> maybe a new viewtiful joe
[0:16:54] <+sinistersally> Who liked the Viewtiful Joe cartoon?
[0:16:56] <@Menitta> If there's a W101 anime, it needs to have certain button prompts IN the frame
[0:16:59] <NeroInfinite> Franxx wasn't on trigger.
[0:17:08] <+Proxzo> Viewtiful joe shoe was trash
[0:17:10] <scoot_io> A Wonderful 101 anime would have to be called Wonderful 100.
[0:17:11] <TrashLeviathan> @ChoculaUltra the animation in that was great
[0:17:17] <%DatAsuna> Who was to blame for franxx then?
[0:17:19] <LegendGHT> viewtiful joe was fine but yeah just make Wonderful 102
[0:17:19] <$FuqBoiSlim> there was a viewtiful joe show?
[0:17:24] <%Wool> Franxx was Abe Shinzo's plan to convince the Japanese to makes babies
[0:17:26] <+Weeewer> Just gimme switch port
[0:17:35] <ELJOVENBATALI> @fuqboislim yeah an anime. it was garbo
[0:17:37] <Floofiie> Bayonetta didn't need an anime adaptaion, but it was ok
[0:17:39] <Man_in_the_Red> if i remember Trigger is seperated by The Gurren People and the NOT Gurren People
[0:17:45] <damienlunas> Persona starts at P4A
[0:17:55] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Not everything needs to be anime
[0:17:55] <+sinistersally> I think VJ cartoon was meh
[0:18:02] <GoldeNOVA> Trigger is all style and no substance
[0:18:10] <%ChoculaUltra> @leviathan666303 there's no denying it ain't pretty af, but I think the praise stops there
[0:18:16] <SheefEatsBeef> damn
[0:18:26] <+Weeewer> I havent watched the playthrough because Im really hoping to play it some day ):
[0:18:33] <TrashLeviathan> @ChoculaUltra A1 did the writing and the plot stuff
[0:18:35] <+Taglog7> What are we talkin about? Kappa
[0:18:38] <gustavozxd> don't remind of persona that goddamn musou game
[0:18:45] <%ChoculaUltra> crossing my fingers we get Viewtiful Joe remasters on the Switch
[0:18:52] <%GohanEgret> I think it's too visually dense for Nintendo to want to fund another shot at it
[0:18:59] <+sinistersally> I think W101 would have been like a VJ anime v2
[0:19:00] <vernardohunk93> nintendo products are too expensive in brazil for me to give a damn about W101
[0:19:07] <gustavozxd> look at dynasty warriors 9, that's the quality i'm expecting from p4s
[0:19:14] <Superbro64> things should be allowed to die
[0:19:20] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Berserk fans and their obsession with becoming popular
[0:19:21] <Jadorsonething> they seem to be pushing astral chain better at least
[0:19:21] <nobody12349> Name one that shouldn't be a Platinum Game
[0:19:22] <Superbro64> thats a fine enough take
[0:19:23] <RiceeFTW> arcsys + jojo PLEASE
[0:19:23] <+kinggum41> ok but arcsys jojo tho
[0:19:24] <%DatAsuna> However we DO need a code geass musou game
[0:19:26] <%ozzrabbit> @haveswordmuststing yes and no. Trigger was created out of people that came from Studio Gainax. So, the guys in Trigger were the guys that worked on TTGL while they were in Gainax
[0:19:26] <%ChoculaUltra> @leviathan666303 ah I see, that clears things up a bit
[0:19:27] <gustavozxd> i'm gonna be the asshole and say the main thing i don't like about nier automata is the combat
[0:19:29] <+Weeewer> Im expecting One Piece Pirate Warriors quality AKA god tier musou game
[0:19:32] <scoot_io> Yeah but make Arcsys Sailor Moon
[0:19:33] <ELJOVENBATALI> ok but hear me out, power rangers platinum game

[0:33:51] <gustavozxd> but if baba is win, then who are you?
[0:33:51] <FrootusClopootus> This game turns into a a whole mess of "REALLY that was the answer!?"
[0:33:52] <RossMirage> You can't win if you are not you.
[0:33:57] <SixthSun2> Remember, woolie, wall is not stop
[0:34:04] <%DatAsuna> Is it possible to connect 2 "is" to one block?
[0:34:05] <kylejefferies> think in three dimensions.
[0:34:08] <251am> 🤔
[0:34:11] <GuelermeDias> it's semantics the game
[0:34:12] <ValidVenasaur> grass is not stop

[0:34:23] <Shastafield> LUL
[0:34:24] <benjiFG> but at what cost...
[0:34:25] <Tisaric> Every solution is logical it just takes wrapping your head around why it's logical
[0:34:29] <+Gamefriendly> whats up chat and @WoolieVersus, just realized this was up. Does anyone know if woolie backed that DMC 5 board game?
[0:34:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WINNER IS YOU

[0:49:29] <FunTruker> no it doensn't
[0:49:30] <tattleworm> that "and" in the "is you" in the previous level really fucked his internal logic
[0:49:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> All Around Me Are Familiar Faces
[0:49:35] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie will figure it out
[0:49:36] <+crimsonharvest> i think i got it

[0:49:47] <Dio_TR> Galaxy Overthinking
[0:49:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie is Brain
[0:49:52] <chambatron> crab and baba is you literally das it man
[0:49:53] <+Despera__> He got confused by the and in the last one
[0:49:54] <251am> baba wana be craba
[0:49:55] <NeroInfinite> Woolie is looped
[0:49:58] <+Weeewer> BIG RIPs inc
[0:49:59] <CandideCamera> woolie is crash
[0:50:00] <Dio_TR> IN MY SKIIIIIIIIN

[0:50:06] <GuelermeDias> I'm legit dying over here.
[0:50:07] <MayorRev> AND
[0:50:09] <%UrsulaCat> woowie
[0:50:10] <purple_bagel> The previous level is he only level that i really dont like, the way it teaches you how the syntax works is super confusing
[0:50:10] <@Menitta> CRAB is RAVE
[0:50:11] <anovertmoose> gotta love chat trying to spoil puzzles
[0:50:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Willie
[0:50:14] <anovertmoose> shame on you people
[0:50:17] <+Javaa01> Read Is Left-Right/Up-Down
[0:50:19] <Diego_Umejuarez> manually worried about woolie right now
[0:50:21] <%DatAsuna> if only he had an and
[0:50:22] <HitchhikingThrough> ....
[0:50:24] <+Despera__> Crab and Baba is You is valid
[0:50:24] <kylejefferies> Proximity of Faces is Memorable
[0:50:25] <Mendin> Woolie Will Figure It Out
[0:50:25] <SixthSun2> Only top to bottom or left to right
[0:50:25] <FrootusClopootus> the learning increases
[0:50:27] <CandideCamera> verb is noun
[0:50:31] <Graxe_> Sink is a Verb, Woolie
[0:50:32] <Bakafied> I love watching this
[0:50:32] <Laironx3> just try everything. The Undo button is your friend.
[0:50:32] <HitchhikingThrough> The learning decreases
[0:50:35] <+crimsonharvest> probably have to use the AND to have the noun be two things
[0:50:36] <+klooswep> TEXT is not JAPANESE
[0:50:36] <+Mormispos> I assume woolie isnt looking at chat
[0:50:36] <kylejefferies> Despra hushy not cheat.
[0:50:37] <$cureneckbeard> [FIGURINg INTENSIFIES]
[0:50:38] <+Despera__> Baba Is You and Crab isn't valid
[0:50:38] <chambatron> crab and baba is you
[0:50:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It hurts to watch but let him solve it on his own
[0:50:39] <Dio_TR> Put more brain juice on the clock
[0:50:39] <gustavozxd> to think he has 2 pushes away from the solution
[0:50:40] <Graxe_> It's like saying Run is You
[0:50:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie Figures it Out : the Game.
[0:50:41] <+Weeewer> OHH

[0:51:46] <+DuurHuur> WOOLIE is OVERTHINK
[0:51:47] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus the rules don't change, the "and" operates differently on different sides of the "is"
[0:51:49] <@Menitta> Crabrave
[0:51:50] <+Weeewer> WOOLIE IS WOOLIE
[0:51:50] <GuelermeDias> crab and baba can be you, but you can't be baba is you AND crab
[0:51:52] <pluswplus> no thats not how it works
[0:51:52] <JumbleJams> crab is baba
[0:51:52] <+Ancopro> objects can, just the solids
[0:51:52] <+crimsonharvest> use AND to be two thing
[0:51:53] <SixthSun2> It's all about your Syntax,Woolie
[0:51:54] <+Gespens> YOU can be anything
[0:51:54] <FrootusClopootus> @WoolieVersus this game will do this to you a ton
[0:51:54] <nobody12349> He already tried Wall and Crab
[0:51:54] <whimsicallifestyle> woolie is headache
[0:51:55] <+nictron90> The issue was that baba became wall, but wall was not you
[0:51:56] <kylejefferies> You is Wall is not valid
[0:51:57] <MayorRev> it's okay
[0:51:59] <@CrankyVT> @WoolieVersus last level it didn't work because Wall was Stop, so you was stop
[0:52:00] <LokirasuSeryk> Baba can't be two things
[0:52:01] <ValidVenasaur> woolie is figured out
[0:52:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolies brain will be a melting ooze once we end the stream
[0:52:01] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus "Trish is mE!" - narancia
[0:52:02] <+Gespens> so long as YOU are Baba
[0:52:03] <kylejefferies> Wall is you is Valid
[0:52:03] <+Javaa01> You lept to assumptions
[0:52:04] <nobody12349> Not crab, but baba
[0:52:04] <+FadingEmber> You apply conditions to nouns
[0:52:05] <GoldeNOVA> Two YOU overlapped

[1:00:57] <+Javaa01> ANSWER IS WRONG
[1:00:58] <Mendin> Woolie contemplates on the meaning of death
[1:00:59] <reonome> why don't you push is somewhere else
[1:01:02] <gslayer14> or... not that
[1:01:04] <gustavozxd> that's an ok idea i guess
[1:01:08] <HitchhikingThrough> Go under 'you' push it up
[1:01:08] <b_ikki> he'll get there
[1:01:09] <nobody12349> Or there's a way easier way of doing it
[1:01:10] <viciousgrim> woolie is an over thinker yes?
[1:01:13] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> how can this be
[1:01:13] <bleugh> woolie is overthink

[1:02:17] <bearwagon> butterfly meme
[1:02:23] <%UrsulaCat> "this is the only way to do it" is the silliest thing woolie said
[1:02:24] <HitchhikingThrough> It's fun when woolie gets attached to an idea
[1:02:26] <SolClips> LUL
[1:02:27] <scoot_io> Dig up
[1:02:31] <chambatron> Can the pillars push off the flag?

[1:02:39] <FunTruker> Set brain to UNGA mode pls
[1:02:40] <+Weeewer> No becaue Flag is not Push
[1:02:42] <Mendin> FLAG is not PUSH so no

[1:02:58] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus key rule stat simple
[1:03:00] <%DatAsuna> Flag could be push too if he wanted
[1:03:03] <ChineseNininga> It's fun watching woolie beat his mind goblin of overthinking things
[1:03:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:04] <Mendin> The only t hing inherently PUSH is the words that define reality
[1:03:07] <gustavozxd> @chambatron no but your idea gets something
[1:03:10] <ChineseNininga> you can do it woolie
[1:03:20] <b_ikki> yeah push is hard coded for text
[1:03:23] <nobody12349> Woolie did an overhead instead of an uppercut
[1:03:24] <+gantz_zero> !schedule
[1:03:24] <%DatAsuna> or star could be win
[1:03:24] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games

[1:03:51] <Zhwoobatte> woolie...
[1:03:55] <%DatAsuna> i can't say ".etc"?
[1:03:56] <+Weeewer> I feel like theres something obvious that would work but I dont want to say it
[1:04:00] <Mendin> This just in Woolie's galactic brain is now larger than the CN Tower
[1:04:05] <SolClips> The pillars have started to move
[1:04:06] <%DatAsuna> say it weewer
[1:04:11] <ChineseNininga> how many pillars can you push in frozen time, star platinum
[1:04:12] <+CaptSaltyPants> people have already said it
[1:04:12] <+skm742> I think the 'baba is you' command being on row 2 was great design on the developer's part, because it forces people to eventually realize the approach woolie is trying doesn't work
[1:04:13] <%DatAsuna> or we bulli u
[1:04:16] <Floofiie> !motivated

[1:04:33] <+YabbaTroll> !motivated
[1:04:36] <hntronium> That's weird, I didn't know you were streaming Woolie, the thing on the side that tracks live followed channels wasn't showing you
[1:04:37] <HitchhikingThrough> Stop. GO UP INSTEAD

[1:05:01] <gustavozxd> woolie just beat the game it's easy
[1:05:03] <Darkpajamaz> don't push. PULL
[1:05:05] <+NoKingArthur> @WoolieVersus you just have to be you
[1:05:08] <Floofiie> PULL
[1:05:08] <HitchhikingThrough> Then don't GO DOWN
[1:05:09] <b_ikki> he cant pull
[1:05:10] <$EldritchBee> you can be 2 things
[1:05:16] <HitchhikingThrough> @Floofiie that's not a fucking thing
[1:05:19] <TrashLeviathan> @alexandrecau win is etc is an invalid statement

[1:05:32] <DomunDomunDomun> Pull is rewind.
[1:05:33] <BreakersAweigh> there is no pull. "pull" is him undoing a move
[1:05:34] <Yomigami> this is frustrating. i cant
[1:05:34] <Apolar_> Woolie is overthink
[1:05:35] <%DatAsuna> He's not reading chat unless you wants help anyway
[1:05:35] <Floofiie> @Youwereeatenbyalid is mean
[1:05:41] <$The_Cassowary> I've thought of 3 solutions and I want to shout them but no backseating lol
[1:05:41] <%DatAsuna> he knows not to look
[1:05:42] <nobody12349> Don't literally pull
[1:05:43] <reonome> @ohnoitspooba star is degeat

[1:06:04] <SebTheFuturist> Oh goodness gracious, I'm afraid to keep watching. I know first-hand how torturous this game is lytWORRY
[1:06:12] <HitchhikingThrough> @Floofiie is Right*
[1:06:17] <iamtheTwitchghost> this game is tight
[1:06:18] <GuelermeDias> this is basically how baba works
[1:06:18] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus can you say what you have tried to do so far?
[1:06:20] <oSLICEo> Just delete the game. You win automatically that way.
[1:06:21] <thespoforth> I now remember why I hate watching other people play puzzle games
[1:06:22] <GuelermeDias> you overthink shit

[1:07:01] <SolClips> Three is Freeze
[1:07:02] <alexandrecau> @leviathan666303 i mean if he is a pillar and touch the flag does it count or baba has to be the one touching
[1:07:06] <Mendin> If you can push Baba through the Death Star when you are not baba
[1:07:10] <251am> baba black sheep have u any wool
[1:07:15] <b_ikki> 🤔
[1:07:15] <Laironx3> You is You
[1:07:17] <251am> yes sir yes sir 3 bags full
[1:07:18] <gustavozxd> OVERT THINK
[1:07:20] <reonome> @alexandrecau it counts but the stars are there
[1:07:20] <TrashLeviathan> @alexandrecau yea but star is defeat
[1:07:22] <251am> one for the master\
[1:07:28] <nobody12349> Don't push it "down"
[1:07:29] <%UrsulaCat> one for my master one for my dame
[1:07:29] <RiceeFTW> @alexandrecau you don't have to be BaBa to win, but if you are Pillar and Star is Defeat, then you die when you touch star as Pillar
[1:07:32] <251am> and one for the dame
[1:07:36] <b_ikki> @alexandrecau "you" has to be the one thats touching
[1:07:43] <%UrsulaCat> one for the little boy who lives down the lane
[1:07:49] <251am> :)
[1:07:51] <b_ikki> whatever is you at the moment
[1:07:52] <+skm742> I think he needs to replay level 2, so he remembers that BABA doesn't need to hit win
[1:07:58] <TrashLeviathan> @alexandrecau if he can put a pillar in there
[1:08:05] <HitchhikingThrough> PILLAR is PUSH on top of BABA is YOU, then push YOU up
[1:08:08] <Apolar_> so close to the solution
[1:08:16] <gigacanuck> is this one of the puzzles with multiple solutions?
[1:08:17] <GuelermeDias> stop backseating
[1:08:20] <alexandrecau> but you can push twopillars in a row one cross the stars like baba
[1:08:20] <GuelermeDias> i will ban you
[1:08:25] <FunTruker> Woolie is playing like this is the last level of the last stage and not the first stage after the tutorial
[1:08:28] <+NarcissistCactus> ban me pussy you won't
[1:08:34] <+NarcissistCactus> 😡
[1:08:34] <GuelermeDias> watch me
[1:08:35] <%UrsulaCat> I will
[1:08:35] <nobody12349> You is movable
[1:08:39] <Mendin> Woolie WHY can you push Baba through the stars?
[1:08:42] <+6PoundsofShrimp> there's another way woolie
[1:08:42] <%DatAsuna> Woolie said he won't read chat so stop worrying about it
[1:08:43] <reonome> @alexandrecau the pillars will just die at the stars
[1:08:45] <HitchhikingThrough> move the YOU
[1:08:53] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> this is hard to watch

[1:09:03] <+6PoundsofShrimp> W O O L I E
[1:09:04] <HitchhikingThrough> Just move you UP
[1:09:05] <nobody12349> Woolie you just need to move better
[1:09:08] <InkyDraconian> YOU is not a static object
[1:09:09] <GuelermeDias> I think he's solved it five times already
[1:09:11] <+Camail> the only thing dumber than backseating is the inability to understand that he isn't looking at chat
[1:09:11] <RiceeFTW> @Mendin YOU have to be on the flag to win, if BaBa is not YOU then you won't win
[1:09:13] <gigacanuck> Woolie will figure it out
[1:09:14] <$The_Cassowary> @reonome No they won't just like baba doesn't as long as baba is not you
[1:09:14] <%DatAsuna> You literally can't backseat unless he does the thing he said he wouldn't so just let people talk. lol
[1:09:17] <%UrsulaCat> baba is up
[1:09:22] <alexandrecau> if one pillar die all die?
[1:09:22] <Darthkitten_Prime> He has the right idea, but reversed.
[1:09:24] <+Double_Tap_That> Chat is Wrong
[1:09:27] <%DatAsuna> It's like talking at the screen, he won't hear you.

[1:11:56] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> woolie is smarter
[1:11:56] <HitchhikingThrough> CORRECT
[1:11:57] <gustavozxd> david cage brings people together to laugh at him, isn't that nice
[1:11:57] <%arcturusblade> That's correct
[1:11:57] <+Weeewer> What if pillars were pushed
[1:12:00] <b_ikki> the rules are on screen NotLikeThis
[1:12:01] <InkyDraconian> You is not static
[1:12:01] <TrashLeviathan> correct
[1:12:01] <gustavozxd> there's a rule you forgot
[1:12:02] <nobody12349> It's like watching someone get a jigsaw to the final piece, can't place to final piece the right way the first time, and then they restart the entire jigsaw

[1:12:23] <viciousgrim> Woolie vs Paige speed run yes yes i need this now
[1:12:24] <Prevot> WOOL is NotLikeThis
[1:12:25] <GuelermeDias> woolie gets something but he doesn't get it applies to other things
[1:12:28] <gustavozxd> multiple rules woolie forgot
[1:12:29] <+CaptSaltyPants> You need to win, not baba
[1:12:32] <reonome> woolie is overthink
[1:12:42] <beatie_g> Can you push the pillars through the stars as baba or will they explode?
[1:12:44] <+Weeewer> Pillar is not you in the start
[1:12:44] <TrashLeviathan> defeat only applies to things that are you @WoolieVersus
[1:12:47] <+Flambage> Baba is just the vessel not "you"
[1:12:48] <+NarcissistCactus> tsos1
[1:12:49] <InkyDraconian> you can move YOU as long as it ends up in a in a sentence
[1:12:51] <HitchhikingThrough> BUT WHAT IF
[1:13:00] <gigacanuck> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
[1:13:01] <nobody12349> Woolie could of won but I don't want to just go ahead and spell it out
[1:13:01] <a_mad_dragon> @WoolieVersus best thing to do is look at every possible combination that can be made with the words you can move, you might spot something you didn't think of before
[1:13:04] <reonome> @leviathan666303 pretty sure he knows that since he pushed baba there
[1:13:07] <Cameony> Can you move the pillars inside of the stars and grab the flag as the pillars?
[1:13:20] <maskedmustelid> correct!
[1:13:22] <Cameony> well i guess that answered that lol
[1:13:23] <$cureneckbeard> WOOLIE is FIGURE

[1:14:00] <sighman55> you also assumed changing the should be your first move
[1:14:00] <+Weeewer> Tried*
[1:14:04] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Woolie moves us! ;A:
[1:14:05] <$FuqBoiSlim> Cant he just move 'star' in "Star is Defeat"???
[1:14:07] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> woolie is overthink
[1:14:11] <+NarcissistCactus> powerhouse of the cell is mitochondria
[1:14:15] <HitchhikingThrough> *keymashing intensifies
[1:14:16] <$cureneckbeard> He can't push something in a corner

[1:14:17] <GoldeNOVA> Think upside down, Woolie
[1:14:20] <b_ikki> no. you cant pull so star is stuck there
[1:14:22] <TrashLeviathan> woolie is over think
[1:14:23] <Darkpajamaz> could he just move "baba is you" up by one space before he really gets the puzzle going?

[1:14:51] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh my god
[1:14:53] <Kamayanna> I mean he might actually be decent at lategame puzzles because he's treating this one like one
[1:14:54] <InkyDraconian> I need a sprite holy fuck

[1:19:33] <+skm742> Chat is aneurism
[1:19:33] <gigacanuck> JAYSUS that took too long
[1:19:33] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:19:35] <Laironx3> Woolie is win
[1:19:36] <+Weeewer> @WoolieVersus could you not have PUSHED PILLAR into Flag, then made Pillar is You?
[1:19:37] <@Menitta> that was the hard way
[1:19:38] <HitchhikingThrough> !AntiWoolie!
[1:19:38] <Prevot> BRAIN is KILL
[1:19:38] <+NarcissistCactus> never doubted
[1:19:38] <+FadingEmber> You can do double definitions btw

[1:19:39] <ohnoitspooba> THERE IT IS
[1:19:39] <SolClips> SeemsGood
[1:19:39] <JonnyJug> I'm impressed that worked
[1:19:39] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie figured it uot
[1:19:39] <+CaptSaltyPants> that is a roundabout way to solve it that is gonna set him up for future failure
[1:19:40] <+RazeEmAll> CHAT is NUT
[1:19:40] <sighman55> road less travelled
[1:19:42] <FunTruker> How did he do it the hardest wat possible
[1:19:44] <Darthkitten_Prime> You did it completely backwards! You did it way harder than it needed to be
[1:19:44] <%arcturusblade> There's a way easier way to do that but hey if it works
[1:19:45] <+EndgameContent> ANTI WOOLIE PUZZLES
[1:19:45] <b_ikki> that was the HARDEST way
[1:19:45] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Now do it again!
[1:19:46] <+Kataguro> That was like a million times harder than it needed to be, but still
[1:19:51] <FunTruker> @WoolieVersus you are playing like this is the last stage and not the first stage after the tutorial
[1:19:53] <InkyDraconian> This game is gonna brain fuck you
[1:19:54] <ManOfReason> Anti anti anti woolie puzzle
[1:19:55] <$The_Cassowary> thank god, my blood pressure is returning to normal lol
[1:20:00] <%UrsulaCat> I am anti anti woolie
[1:20:01] <$cureneckbeard> The key is that Baba doesn't have to take the flag to win. "YOU" have to
[1:20:02] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @gustavozxd
[1:20:05] <b_ikki> yes they can
[1:20:06] <Kyphen15> That was when you were pillar
[1:20:07] <+Weeewer> No they dont
[1:20:07] <+skm742> <3 <3
[1:20:08] <+Javaa01> No
[1:20:09] <+YabbaTroll> ye they can if they aint you
[1:20:10] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> No
[1:20:10] <$Ralfclogs> No
[1:20:11] <b_ikki> "defeat" applies to "you" only
[1:20:11] <tattleworm> defeat isn't sink
[1:20:12] <maskedmustelid> Only when you're the pillar
[1:20:12] <FunTruker> No they don't
[1:20:12] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Not if they're not you
[1:20:13] <+Gespens> Only if X is You
[1:20:14] <chambatron> You could have made wall is you
[1:20:14] <reonome> its fine you did it
[1:20:14] <zedravan> no they dont
[1:20:14] <anarchistPastry> the pillars only blow up if pillar is you
[1:20:14] <gustavozxd> oh my
[1:20:15] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Stop making up rules Woolie
[1:20:16] <+Javaa01> That's explicitly not true
[1:20:16] <Apolar_> They only blow up if they are you
[1:20:16] <Mendin> The Pillars that are YOU
[1:20:16] <+DuurHuur> Just try it woolie
[1:20:17] <+CaptSaltyPants> but you pushed baba through
[1:20:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only if you're the pillars
[1:20:18] <%UrsulaCat> stack pillar
[1:20:18] <Bakafied> Win is pillar?
[1:20:20] <HitchhikingThrough> Only if it Pillar isn't you
[1:20:20] <+Kataguro> Only if Pillar Is You
[1:20:20] <+Weeewer> Pillar is NOT YOU so you can poush it through the star
[1:20:21] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus yes you could
[1:20:22] <%KetsuoTaberu> Defeat only kills things that are "you"
[1:20:22] <Darthkitten_Prime> They CAN get to the flag. They only blow up if they're YOU
[1:20:22] <rasamune> Things can't be DEFEATed if they are not YOU
[1:20:23] <+JustToWatch> not if pillar isn't you
[1:20:23] <WllmBrandt> defeat only works on things that are you
[1:20:23] <%UrsulaCat> STACK PILLAR
[1:20:25] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus if Pillar is not YOU then it won't die when it touches DEFEAT
[1:20:26] <+6PoundsofShrimp> hahaha WOolie you're doing a good job
[1:20:28] <Vigogs> they wouldn't blow up if Pillar isn't You
[1:20:28] <gustavozxd> FORGETTING RULES
[1:20:29] <b_ikki> @WoolieVersus "defeat" applies to "you" only
[1:20:29] <Zhwoobatte> @WoolieVersus defeat and sink are not the same thing
[1:20:30] <Mendin> DEATH kills YOU, not everything
[1:20:34] <%lemuhollow> The Pillar can get to the flag, they only get destroyed when they're you
[1:20:34] <TopLeftCenter> only you can be defeated, if pillar is not you then pillar is not defeated
[1:20:34] <$Ralfclogs> defeat only works if it's you
[1:20:35] <@Commando_Joe> GUYS
[1:20:36] <%wujak> if "baba is you" then you could have pushed a line of pillars in like you did with the rocks and the skull earlier. then make "pillar is you"
[1:20:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @DappercatEsquire
[1:20:37] <@Commando_Joe> limesGun

[1:20:40] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Don't be dishearten ;A:
[1:20:40] <+Weeewer> DEFEAT KILLS YOU, NOT OBJECT
[1:20:41] <+Kataguro> You're fine, Woolie
[1:20:41] <SolClips> Stack pillars and then push the then become them
[1:20:41] <anarchistPastry> @WoolieVersus The pillars only blow up if Pillar is You
[1:20:42] <InkyDraconian> Is there a brain pocket pussy >:?
[1:20:43] <+conqab> snippily at that
[1:20:44] <+Buka_Zero> BIG OOF
[1:20:44] <+Javaa01> Inanimate objects cannot die
[1:20:45] <AMajorTom> You had a whole screen and chose to use a small area and that made it harder
[1:20:45] <steelmorrigan> You. Did. it.
[1:20:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> DEFEAT only cancels out YOU
[1:20:46] <%DatAsuna> tl;dr the only rules are the ones literally on screen
[1:20:49] <+DappercatEsquire> believe in the you the solves the puzzles woolie
[1:20:54] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus if Pillar is not YOU then it won't die when it touches DEFEAT.
[1:20:56] <HitchhikingThrough> @woolieversus DEFEAT is not SINK
[1:20:57] <tattleworm> i like this one
[1:21:06] <b_ikki> smol
[1:21:09] <+Weeewer> Woolie not listening to chat on an important lesson...
[1:21:11] <NeroInfinite> Biig
[1:21:13] <+Weeewer> Sigh
[1:21:14] <%UrsulaCat> BABA IS BIG
[1:21:18] <%DatAsuna> Every level tells you plenty to beat it
[1:21:21] <NeroInfinite> nope
[1:21:21] <Darthkitten_Prime> Sigh.
[1:21:21] <chambatron> Baba is win right?
[1:21:22] <Graxe_> It's zoomed in because this is all you need
[1:21:26] <NeroInfinite> That's how it be
[1:21:28] <%arcturusblade> I feel like "DEFEAT" throws off so many people
[1:21:29] <251am> big baba
[1:21:30] <InkyDraconian> Baba is unit
[1:21:31] <%GohanEgret> BABA is THICC
[1:21:32] <+Kataguro> I love this one
[1:21:34] <gustavozxd> but if baba is win then who are you?
[1:21:35] <+6PoundsofShrimp> wait mod was my message bad?
[1:21:36] <@akuda_bar> baba is absolut eunit
[1:21:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Different levels just have different sizes, that's all
[1:21:46] <bearwagon> wait is assuming absolutes a way of thinking
[1:21:47] <+Weeewer> But if Baba Is You then whos driving the plane!?!
[1:21:50] <@akuda_bar> @6PoundsofShrimp capital letters
[1:21:55] <Mendin> Oh my god bear is driving?
[1:21:59] <@Commando_Joe> So apparently Death Stranding is gonna use the Horizon Zero Dawn engine
[1:22:00] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Ahhh I see
[1:22:02] <+Kataguro> How can that be?
[1:22:03] <Laironx3> Baba stopped thinking
[1:22:04] <GuelermeDias> this one is kinda weird
[1:22:05] <RiceeFTW> just a small level
[1:22:08] <b_ikki> it's just a small stage so it zooms in
[1:22:08] <gustavozxd> 5
[1:22:11] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Woolie needs to turn that L from Loss to Lesson
[1:22:12] <nobody12349> Size is Off putting
[1:22:12] <%DatAsuna> now he remembers he can pull words
[1:22:14] <%UrsulaCat> ah I understand how to play
[1:22:15] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus the level is just small and it zooms in to compensate, it's not a trick lol
[1:22:15] <NeroInfinite> It's meant to bebig
[1:22:23] <+unclekulikov> feel the Ikaruga
[1:22:25] <Graxe_> Small levels zoom in so that it focuses on what you need
[1:22:40] <GuelermeDias> the level is small and it tries to compensate by embiggening itself, it's just like pat!
[1:22:41] <$FuqBoiSlim> Flag is you??? FrankerZ
[1:22:43] <251am> Squid1 SeriousSloth Squid4
[1:22:49] <Mendin> @Commando_Joe The Horizon people apparently just handed Kojima the sourcecode for their engine really early on, so all KojiPro had to do is refine it a little bit and away we went
[1:22:55] <NeroInfinite> no then he'd just be in the wall
[1:22:57] <+DappercatEsquire> ya goofed it bud

[1:31:28] <gigacanuck> overthink
[1:31:29] <+YabbaTroll> you would think that works wouldnt you
[1:31:32] <Graxe_> But Door is Stop
[1:31:32] <+6PoundsofShrimp> he should just havdoor is still stop
[1:31:37] <fearhurst> door push
[1:31:37] <RiceeFTW> DOOR IS STOP
[1:31:38] <+klooswep> DOOR is SHUT. DOOR is MADE BY THOSE WHO ARE DEAD
[1:31:40] <251am> open sesame
[1:31:41] <hntronium> Door is push?
[1:31:42] <+Kataguro> Different kind of Open
[1:31:42] <+stagemage> open is a verb
[1:31:47] <%UrsulaCat> door is existential
[1:31:48] <ohnoitspooba> door is
[1:31:51] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice
[1:31:53] <@Menitta> DOOR IS STICK
[1:31:56] <+DuurHuur> BRAIN IS HURT
[1:31:58] <@Commando_Joe> door is key
[1:31:58] <b_ikki> maybe some
[1:31:58] <@Menitta> DOOR IS STUCK
[1:31:59] <+Kataguro> Probably
[1:32:04] <reonome> maybe
[1:32:05] <Kamayanna> The dev is currently working on how to deal with translations
[1:32:05] <NeroInfinite> Probably
[1:32:05] <EliahNebb> This would work in German.
[1:32:06] <DomunDomunDomun> The way open works is gonna fuck woolie up for a while.
[1:32:07] <+D00msDayDan> baba wa kimi
[1:32:08] <Apolar_> Works in portuguese, even better actually
[1:32:08] <tattleworm> baka is you
[1:32:08] <+YabbaTroll> i heard they are translated it for korean at least
[1:32:09] <+BurningCouches> ive seen lots of koreans play this in english
[1:32:09] <SixthSun2> Kanji is right to left, right?
[1:32:10] <+NiktenKing> YES
[1:32:11] <TrashLeviathan> go to dot
[1:32:15] <@Menitta> Kiwami IS Extreme
[1:32:20] <b_ikki> it would sound a lot less charming
[1:32:26] <Parapattern> I REALLY doubt it
[1:32:27] <GuelermeDias> so, there's a thing called universal grammar
[1:32:27] <scoot_io> LANGUAGE is FUCK
[1:32:30] <+DeaconBluesClues> you maybe can replace "is" with an arrow sign?
[1:32:35] <maskedmustelid> If it's in right to left, then you just flip the stage
[1:32:36] <%UrsulaCat> YOU IS genuine cocksucker
[1:32:37] <QaizerArt> Kiwami is Extreme is Kiryu
[1:32:38] <GuelermeDias> and syntax is universal too
[1:32:39] <+NiktenKing> You would use GA
[1:32:40] <GuelermeDias> so yeah
[1:32:40] <gustavozxd> WAluigi
[1:32:40] <hntronium> WAH
[1:32:41] <+Kataguro> Wa
[1:32:41] <+Double_Tap_That> Wario is Wah
[1:32:45] <sugewin> Waaaaaaah
[1:32:45] <+Polter_ge1st> It would be a lot less cute but yeah you can
[1:32:47] <GuelermeDias> you just change the order
[1:32:48] <%arcturusblade> The late-game keywords could be a real problem to translate
[1:32:48] <+NiktenKing> GA is the definitive NOMINATIVE
[1:32:50] <Kamayanna> Worth mentioning that Japanese people are familiar enough with english words to understand most likely?
[1:32:51] <fearhurst> desu ne warr des stoppu
[1:32:55] <Shwepie> @WoolieVersus There is a reason most programming is done in English regardless of the speaker's native tongue.
[1:32:55] <SixthSun2> I guess you'd just have to look at how Japanese speakers write code
[1:33:03] <Jaxnos> kanji reads left to right, it's just the paging that is right to left

[1:37:07] <AndrewsLovesPizza> baba is you
[1:37:09] <FacetiousAF> sorry, what's wrong with the tiles that flag is on that one does not simply walk on them
[1:37:11] <DomunDomunDomun> @jaxnos door isn't shut
[1:37:13] <RiceeFTW> no yoda rules here
[1:37:14] <GuelermeDias> subject, verb, subject complement
[1:37:15] <eanscrale> actually this would fit Japanese pretty well
[1:37:16] <+skm742> @dukenux nope, the text with backgrounds can't be the subject
[1:37:16] <+Camail> keykeke
[1:37:18] <hntronium> Can anyone in chat tell me what the rules for pushing and pulling is?
[1:37:24] <GuelermeDias> you can't have subject complement go first
[1:37:29] <%GohanEgret> @FrustratedAF flag is currently not win
[1:37:37] <+CaptSaltyPants> Can only push, the pulling is a rewind
[1:37:37] <FacetiousAF> oh shit :/
[1:37:38] <+skm742> @dukenux not the other way around though!
[1:37:41] <DomunDomunDomun> @hntronium There is no pulling, that's a rewind
[1:37:42] <%UrsulaCat> push key?
[1:37:45] <hntronium> Woolie if you move door to key will it opem tje door?
[1:37:48] <Jaxnos> door make shut then door open when push key?
[1:37:50] <+jdb53> you can only push (except for certain specific rules), when it looks like he's pulling, he's using a rewind button
[1:37:53] <anarchistPastry> @hntronium "pulling" is an illusion, theres an undo button
[1:37:59] <gustavozxd> @Jaxnos door needs to be "shut"
[1:38:01] <hntronium> Oh, I see
[1:38:09] <251am> lol
[1:38:17] <steelmorrigan> Key is you?
[1:38:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:39:14] <Cameony> keke is door is you run into key as door
[1:39:19] <251am> ram door into key
[1:39:20] <+BurningCouches> youd have to like it a lot frustrate

[1:40:07] <+BurningCouches> they are kirby headphones!
[1:40:10] <ghostravens> this game is melting my brain and i'm not even playing it

[1:40:28] <gustavozxd> all the characters look awesome
[1:40:29] <$cureneckbeard> Someone said the headphones are to cover up the smoke coming out of Woolie's ears
[1:40:30] <+JustToWatch> GIVE HIM MORE COOL MASKS
[1:40:32] <HitchhikingThrough> What happened?
[1:40:35] <%GohanEgret> die hard man
[1:40:39] <Mendin> It's simple: Door became you and key became keke so door-you could make flag win
[1:40:40] <ghostravens> COMBO is CON

[1:44:38] <ghostravens> @Youwereeatenbyalid yeah, check his twitter
[1:44:41] <gustavozxd> @GohanEgret yeah, but holy shit it has to be something very specific for woolie to say "fuck that show and everyone that likes it"
[1:45:11] <%GohanEgret> @gustavozxd true, I went and looked up the ending and I just kind of shrugged
[1:45:13] <+dudecool61> You can hit the pause button to see all your current rules
[1:45:14] <Cameony> I finally did the math, and I thought this whole time that I started watching the guys in middle school

[1:47:10] <RantingRavager> CHAT is SPOILER
[1:47:11] <Slimeking_Mike> Dope
[1:47:24] <Prevot> that ain't no sunflower
[1:47:30] <HitchhikingThrough> @RantingRavager are people spoiling puzzles, or does the game have a story?
[1:47:33] <%UrsulaCat> one daisy
[1:47:38] <Mendin> Woolie try the EX level (That [.] one in the waterland
[1:47:40] <Parapattern> Honestly, we could replace the entire English language with the diction of this game and still be okay 80% of the time
[1:47:43] <metrying> @Youwereeatenbyalid this game has extensive lore
[1:47:55] <lambishly> Chat is Spoiler is Push
[1:47:58] <ayskoh> this level is a nightmare

[1:48:16] <ManOfReason> In the end you learn that baba is dead
[1:48:16] <Zhwoobatte> WHORE WIFE is DEAD
[1:48:17] <hntronium> What happens when Baba is Wall?
[1:48:18] <HitchhikingThrough> @metrying oh boy oh boy. I feel like this game is building up to a sick ass Sentence you have to make to beat the game. "WORLD is SAVED" or something.
[1:48:20] <rasamune> This one is so fucking hard
[1:48:21] <%ChoculaUltra> pfff, can't believe none of you watched the Baba is You lore vids by BabaVidya Kappa
[1:48:35] <+pkmamsters> Dwayne the Baba Johnson
[1:48:37] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh god it's this one.
[1:48:42] <HitchhikingThrough> Strap in folks.
[1:48:56] <gigacanuck> @ChoculaUltra lore vids? are you serious my good man?
[1:48:57] <the_sprankton> "Oh god it's this one." describes like half the levels in this game.
[1:49:02] <%ChoculaUltra> holy crap - are those crabs wearing sunglasses

[1:49:47] <metrying> you have to change the crabs properties im not gonna spoil too much
[1:50:06] <%ChoculaUltra> although this game does strike me as the kind that would actually have surprisingly deep lore somehow
[1:50:13] <HitchhikingThrough> @DomunDomunDomun DOG is BIG. ROMAN is HEAT
[1:50:20] <%arcturusblade> oh boy this one took me a while
[1:50:21] <Mendin> WOOLIE is ASSUMING

[2:00:48] <+napargonaga> You can't be the first word.

[2:01:02] <hntronium> I see
[2:01:08] <zedravan> Defeat only kills You
[2:01:08] <taken_lul> @BenPooped you can't pull, there's only rewind
[2:01:16] <251am> crab is stinky feet
[2:01:22] <BenPooped> Pull the Stop off the Wall and walk through to get the Flag.
[2:01:22] <chambatron> Pusch the rock ONCE
[2:01:26] <chambatron> Yes
[2:01:34] <Mendin> oh no
[2:01:34] <chambatron> Noooooo
[2:01:35] <Holgast> @BenPooped can't pull in this game
[2:01:36] <+skm742> @taken_lul for now, that is correct. Later that changes
[2:01:40] <BenPooped> @taken_lul Oh I see.
[2:02:03] <Holgast> when he's 'pulling' it's just undoing the push
[2:02:04] <%HDmexiqtioner> Hey Woolie, what's up mang? Just sent you info.
[2:02:04] <patrickIy> Can't wait until Woolie complete's this puzzle and goes "OHHHHHHHH!!!" :P

[2:02:21] <Zhwoobatte> good job
[2:02:21] <EyeFarted> Can you pull apart WALL IS STOP?
[2:02:23] <BenPooped> So when it looks like he's pulling, he's actually rewinding previous actions?
[2:02:26] <Holgast> yes
[2:02:28] <Slimeking_Mike> Dope.
[2:02:31] <$Louie_Salmon> A big part of this game is moving things around to keep them in usable positions because you might need it later
[2:02:32] <b_ikki> you cant pull
[2:02:42] <+napargonaga> @Intolerable Nope, you can't pull.
[2:02:51] <%DedlokPM> @Intolerable you can only push. anything that looks like a pull is him rewinding
[2:02:54] <b_ikki> when it looks like hes pulling he's just undoing his actions
[2:02:55] <BenPooped> This game should be called You Can't Pull
[2:02:58] <violetvillein> You can pull, but only when Pull is involved
[2:03:02] <reonome> NO
[2:03:07] <chambatron> Noooooooo
[2:03:20] <reonome> woolie is assume LUL
[2:03:21] <+campasino> crab is you and push
[2:03:21] <chambatron> No :(
[2:03:24] <BestTeaMaker> Woolie you are so close
[2:03:24] <EyeFarted> OK never played this so don't know mechanics
[2:03:26] <$Louie_Salmon> I know some people came back to this after finishing several other worlds, it's pretty tricky
[2:03:30] <Mendin> Call Paige
[2:03:30] <BenPooped> Then it should be called You Can't Pull Until Later
[2:03:31] <FacetiousAF> wall is push????
[2:03:33] <ChineseNininga> Is it mandatory tho
[2:03:35] <ChineseNininga> is it tho
[2:03:39] <chambatron> Yes
[2:04:02] <Cameony> the dude that said this game is like a "1% of people can't" whatever ad is 1000% correct because watching people play this game is frustrating as shit lol
[2:04:03] <%gatorafan> Internet is Trash
[2:04:05] <taken_lul> he doesn't have to puch crab does he?
[2:04:07] <kuningaz45> Woolie is Win

[2:04:16] <Mendin> woolie plz
[2:04:18] <Shady_Squid> baba is crab?
[2:04:20] <hntronium> Hey Woolie can you make Baba is Push?
[2:04:22] <kuningaz45> puzzle is defeat
[2:04:22] <Holgast> honestly it's funny to just try everything like that
[2:04:35] <reonome> woolie stop making crab is defeat
[2:04:35] <+Double_Tap_That> He's assuming that just touching the crabs will kill him, when in reality it's going onto their space
[2:04:35] <$Louie_Salmon> @cameony If you beat this level you're legally a master
[2:04:37] <hntronium> Does pushing Baba into Crab then count as defeat?
[2:04:39] <251am> rock smash crab
[2:04:41] <zedravan> @ChineseNininga no this is a bonus level
[2:04:41] <XxZulaxX> Push the rock towards the 2 crabs. And once it touches the flag make rock is you
[2:04:45] <RoboXGP> IS IS
[2:04:50] <$cureneckbeard> Defeat only affects You, not necessarily Baba
[2:04:54] <metalwater8> Why can’t he pull the word crab?
[2:04:55] <$Louie_Salmon> I love how the world just ends when nothing is you
[2:04:56] <@Menitta> there is no spoon
[2:05:09] <Cameony> there is no pull
[2:05:18] <%UrsulaCat> there is no crab
[2:05:30] <+carp_> can you make wall is push
[2:05:31] <barucafe> only push and rewind
[2:05:35] <Rosy_Joan> when he pulls thats just a redo buttpn to rewind
[2:05:41] <maskedmustelid> HAIR is PULL
[2:05:44] <+senoue> Can you walk into crab with 2 baba?

[2:06:14] <Bakafied> But I'll feel bad!
[2:06:14] <Cameony> back seat all you want, someone said he isn't looking at chat so he doesn't get spoiled
[2:06:16] <+marumariball> HEAD is HURT
[2:06:18] <violetvillein> Chat Is Sad
[2:06:20] <+Buka_Zero> this is all because he never really figured out thew star is defeat map
[2:06:20] <Floofiie> touche

[2:06:23] <Holgast> good point @hntronium can you push the TEXT Baba over the crab
[2:06:24] <a_mad_dragon> pull is later
[2:06:24] <$Louie_Salmon> @bakafied You can also whisper me and I'll let you know
[2:06:26] <MrLittleSam> This is an interesting idae for a game.
[2:06:29] <@Solidus_113> this is an EX mission
[2:06:29] <metalwater8> Could he reset then put the push before the crab?
[2:06:30] <XxZulaxX> words and rock can go through the crabs
[2:06:31] <Prevot> PUZZLE is DIFFICULT
[2:06:32] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:06:34] <%UrsulaCat> eh
[2:06:35] <Laironx3> Woolie's public enemy #1 CRAB
[2:06:35] <FacetiousAF> its tricky to rock and rhyme :/
[2:06:35] <BenPooped> This game is an adaptation of that video Randy Pitchford posted.
[2:06:36] <%HDmexiqtioner> Is there anything stopping you from pulling the word Crab?
[2:06:38] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> MIND is FUKD
[2:06:38] <+skm742> @senoue That will delete both baba. Defeat destroys all 'you' objects that move into it

[2:07:15] <nobody12349> woolie is also assuming that he should push rock into crab immediately
[2:07:19] <scoot_io> The visual effects should have reversed too
[2:07:21] <+ktothec99> I struggled with this level... but that also describes every level in this game
[2:07:23] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> Thanks chat
[2:07:23] <+PenmanLupine> I see the answer now

[2:31:53] <+kinggum41> Woolie is cool
[2:31:53] <Shastafield> geodude
[2:31:55] <pibbleton> Line up all three rocks :)
[2:32:00] <someyounguy1> if you is rock and rock is float you flaot right?
[2:32:00] <reonome> ehhhhhh???

[2:32:16] <arkv01> BaBa is RISING
[2:32:17] <Mendin> ehhhhhh? Are we getting some 3rd Birthday Aya Woolie Moans?
[2:32:25] <lautalocos> glass is broken, gamers is rise
[2:32:32] <Prevot> WOOL is READ, CHAT is SPOIL
[2:32:39] <damienlunas> Woolie is Cheat
[2:32:45] <+FunStuffAvenue> Wool is Smart
[2:33:00] <worldbrand> Woolie is Figuring
[2:33:00] <+skm742> It's ok that woolie is cheat, because chat is dumb
[2:33:11] <NukeDaHippies> BABA IS ROCK?
[2:33:18] <+イベル> There's something funny about listening to someone play Baba. The thoughts of a Baba player sound like the ramblings of a madman without context.
[2:33:20] <%fatal_penguin_> Woolie used PUSH
[2:33:27] <Mendin> Understand the Concept of SINK
[2:33:29] <noodlerush> hey
[2:33:33] <GoldeNOVA> I just realized, this is Woolie Will Figure It Out LIVE Kappa
[2:33:41] <+Valison> CHAT is HERRING and RED
[2:33:44] <+FunStuffAvenue> Woolie is sink
[2:33:45] <someyounguy1> or if rock is you and you is push can you bring win over?
[2:33:48] <NukeDaHippies> If you do Baba is rock, won't you float??
[2:33:49] <%UrsulaCat> alright I'm bout to head out
[2:34:07] <MrLittleSam> Peace
[2:34:07] <someyounguy1> sames ursula cat
[2:34:10] <someyounguy1> ciao all.
[2:34:14] <ghostravens> @UrsulaCat take care!
[2:34:16] <+skm742> @NukeDaHippies Yeah, but then he can't touch the flag
[2:34:20] <reonome> push the win over
[2:34:29] <fearhurst> despite being only 13 percent of you
[2:34:35] <+MrLily> text is not float?
[2:34:46] <worldbrand> Woolie is Best
[2:34:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:34:52] <Malik1002> What if BaBa is rock
[2:34:53] <dee388> this is stange
[2:34:54] <%HDmexiqtioner> !uptime
[2:34:54] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 44 minutes
[2:35:01] <dee388> strange*
[2:35:12] <Malik1002> then Baba can float
[2:35:13] <arkv01> BaBa needs daiper change now
[2:35:20] <+PeaceCentennial> baba push
[2:35:20] <XxZulaxX> Or you know, push win away from flag
[2:35:36] <worldbrand> Do you?
[2:35:41] <OtterSlinger> @XxZulaxX Water is Sink though
[2:35:53] <+MrLily> ROCK is WIN?
[2:36:00] <%HDmexiqtioner> Winter Is Coming
[2:36:04] <%HDmexiqtioner> ohh wait
[2:36:19] <+skm742> @MrLily rock is float, can't touch baba
[2:36:31] <%fatal_penguin_> Winter is Cumming
[2:36:47] <Mendin> Woolie is missing/forgetting a fundamental aspect of reality
[2:36:48] <+skm742> @MrLily but your thought process would provide clues
[2:36:49] <numbus_26> rock can still touch text, right?
[2:36:53] <worldbrand> Gun is Jump
[2:37:01] <dee388> push rock first?
[2:37:10] <arkv01> BaBa is working in Montreal construction
[2:37:15] <+skm742> There's the clues!
[2:37:17] <+PeaceCentennial> WORDS THAT KILL
[2:37:20] <Mendin> And there we go
[2:37:24] <worldbrand> Woolie is Figuring!
[2:37:27] <+MrLily> FLAG IS in water?
[2:37:35] <Slimeking_Mike> WORDSTHAT KILL
[2:37:37] <fearhurst> kill push and is
[2:37:39] <gustavozxd> just watching this game made me super tired holy shit i'm going to sleep
[2:37:40] <XxZulaxX> Oh. Text to water and make a bridge
[2:37:48] <ChineseNininga> WORDS THAT KILL
[2:37:59] <FacetiousAF> can't get the WIN over water?
[2:38:08] <fearhurst> win sinks
[2:38:09] <+MrLily> push PUSH in water
[2:38:11] <patrickIy> Last level had Text is float and you had to move the rocks to destroy the water. Now it's Rock is Float. SeemsGood
[2:38:17] <HitchhikingThrough> Just push some words in, SMH
[2:38:33] <%DedlokPM> @FrustratedAF any word that is not floating will sink as soon as it hits the water
[2:38:36] <scoot_io> words can die
[2:38:36] <MiraiNoUsagi> I just want woolie to figure it out, but the way he thinks its his worst enemy
[2:38:41] <NukeDaHippies> Maybe if you make Baba a rock and the rock you then you push baba over
[2:38:41] <damienlunas> This is still just the beginning. This game goes to a level complexity and difficulty I never would have expected from a puzzle game being sold today.
[2:38:47] <nobody12349> Let the bunny die
[2:38:57] <the_sprankton> you can beat the game without seeing like half of it
[2:39:01] <+PenmanLupine> oh dang. I see it
[2:39:26] <arkv01> BaBa is live road showing
[2:39:27] <+PenmanLupine> rock is you, let baba die, go back to baba is you, make 2 babas, let another baba die win
[2:39:28] <deafmutelaughing> @coltdemont that seems to be the intention with this game
[2:39:43] <worldbrand> A bit messy
[2:39:50] <worldbrand> But it works
[2:39:56] <b_ikki> it doesnt
[2:40:01] <dee388> cant touch rocks
[2:40:03] <b_ikki> rock is float
[2:40:04] <worldbrand> oh right rock is float
[2:40:12] <+PeaceCentennial> Baba is Win should work?
[2:40:16] <+MrLily> push PUSH left one then win
[2:40:23] <+skm742> @PenmanLupine you can't end up making 2 babas with that plan, you can't make 'baba is rock'
[2:40:27] <NukeDaHippies> baba is win Kappa
[2:40:32] <b_ikki> baba isnt related to the win condition NotLikeThis
[2:40:32] <+PeaceCentennial> just move push somewhere
[2:40:37] <b_ikki> just you
[2:40:38] <vernardohunk93> why not just push ROCK and PUSH into water?
[2:40:42] <numbus_26> yeah
[2:40:44] <reonome> baba can only be one thing in this level
[2:40:46] <worldbrand> Baba can't be win and you here... however...
[2:40:48] <b_ikki> "you" has to win, baba is just another prop
[2:40:51] <arkv01> BaBa is just an insignificant mortal :(
[2:41:02] <reonome> @vernardohunk93 rock floats
[2:41:04] <patrickIy> @vernardohunk93 Ya that's the solution. Woolie just hasn't figured it out.
[2:41:07] <+PeaceCentennial> baba is win
[2:41:14] <maskedmustelid> ROCK beats SCISSORS
[2:41:14] <+PeaceCentennial> or you is win?
[2:41:17] <dee388> baba is you is win?
[2:41:25] <arkv01> raise your flag BaBa
[2:41:28] <OtterSlinger> Verbs can't be the start of sentences
[2:41:28] <GoldeNOVA> Does it? Kappa
[2:41:29] <vernardohunk93> @reonome the word rock, not the obejct
[2:41:40] <reonome> oooh ok
[2:41:44] <@Solidus_113> flag is trick
[2:41:48] <dee388> or push the rocks down before making you is rock?
[2:41:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:41:50] <JigsK> baba is you is win is not a legal rule
[2:41:51] <worldbrand> Woolie was Close
[2:41:54] <steelmorrigan> Rock is Win?
[2:41:56] <SpaceGuntank> this game will for sure fry your brain at one point
[2:41:57] <arkv01> flag is hole in one
[2:41:58] <nobody12349> Flag is a fake ass bitch
[2:41:59] <fearhurst> keyword is bridge
[2:42:04] <b_ikki> you had half of the right idea
[2:42:07] <NickHatesSnow> Baba is Win?
[2:42:08] <zedravan> words are not float
[2:42:08] <reonome> @NJigglypuff it is a legal rule, you just can't do it in this level
[2:42:09] <NukeDaHippies> Why can't you push your text into the river??
[2:42:12] <MrLittleSam> Brain is hurt
[2:42:14] <GoldeNOVA> You only need win from the other side
[2:42:17] <zargy> not a very good shot if I do say so myself
[2:42:31] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> ALL YOU NEED IS WIN
[2:42:32] <+PenmanLupine> oh wow yeah. I think its as easy as that
[2:42:33] <+napargonaga> Now what?
[2:42:36] <arkv01> woolie needs Monster Energy Drink™
[2:42:38] <dee388> or maybe destroy rock on river?
[2:42:39] <$RilsRislan> what about killing the words on the left
[2:42:42] <OtterSlinger> We all float down here
[2:42:44] <dee388> rock word i mean
[2:42:46] <b_ikki> cant destroy rock, rock floats
[2:42:50] <InkyDraconian> I see solution
[2:42:55] <damienlunas> Can he just do rock is you, rock is win?
[2:42:58] <NukeDaHippies> So if you push rock and is into the river, wouldn't that work? lol
[2:42:58] <fearhurst> Woolie needs the new Monster Protein Energy
[2:43:01] <arkv01> everyone has a number... even BaBa
[2:43:02] <JigsK> @reonome i mean as one straight rule. you can make 2 different rules that equate to the same
[2:43:02] <reonome> destroy rock text
[2:43:04] <communistjk> Rock and push in water?
[2:43:08] <b_ikki> does he have it
[2:43:11] <+PenmanLupine> push the words rock and push into the water
[2:43:11] <$RilsRislan> I think he could push Rock and In into the the water
[2:43:11] <worldbrand> PogChamp
[2:43:11] <+napargonaga> Rock is Pointless?
[2:43:13] <HitchhikingThrough> @communistjk you are correct
[2:43:16] <b_ikki> he has it
[2:43:16] <InkyDraconian> YEE
[2:43:17] <deafmutelaughing> HOW
[2:43:17] <$RilsRislan> oh hey
[2:43:19] <reonome> that works
[2:43:22] <dee388> oh dang
[2:43:27] <+napargonaga> Huh, that works.
[2:43:27] <patrickIy> Woolie does the hardest way possible LUL
[2:43:30] <zargy> AHHHHGGGGGG
[2:43:35] <+PenmanLupine> or that
[2:43:35] <nobody12349> finally
[2:43:38] <+PenmanLupine> lol
[2:43:40] <Mendin> @patrickIy Therein lies the genius of Baba is You
[2:43:40] <vernardohunk93> i dont think you could do it harder
[2:43:47] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> GAME is GOOD
[2:43:48] <XxZulaxX> Not intended but eh it works
[2:43:48] <ohnoitspooba> that works I guess
[2:43:50] <b_ikki> oh this one was annoying
[2:43:54] <SelfMaidMan> i feel like that shouldn't have worked
[2:43:55] <b_ikki> finnicky
[2:43:56] <arkv01> @patrickIy its the best way for streaming purposes BloodTrail
[2:43:56] <Mendin> Hey look there's the spinning cogs
[2:44:00] <gigacanuck> meanwhile Stef is lying in bed desperately trying to figure out what fiendish puzzles Woolie is tackling
[2:44:12] <coracor> OMEGALUL
[2:44:12] <benjiFG> what
[2:44:20] <b_ikki> waterwaterwater
[2:44:21] <%DedlokPM> Could have also: used words from left side to push into the water. Or pushed "Rock is you" up and then pushed "Win" over to "Baba is"
[2:44:23] <Mendin> Oh MY GOD
[2:44:24] <Chronomancer_Supreme> WIN is DED
[2:44:28] <dee388> oooo
[2:44:28] <+skm742> eye is open
[2:44:32] <NukeDaHippies> Winner is dead
[2:44:34] <zargy> I didn't know you could do that
[2:44:41] <OtterSlinger> Text Must Float, Spice Must Flow
[2:44:42] <damienlunas> I think I see it
[2:44:47] <nobody12349> Solution is Simple
[2:44:53] <%fatal_penguin_> MORTIS is YOU
[2:44:55] <%DedlokPM> I see it too
[2:44:59] <arkv01> GRRM is Push
[2:45:02] <worldbrand> There we go
[2:45:02] <NukeDaHippies> Ok...if you destroy one part of water
[2:45:12] <NukeDaHippies> and put text is win
[2:45:15] <fearhurst> I thee it
[2:45:16] <+PeaceCentennial> oh that's not what I was expecting
[2:45:18] <dee388> nice!
[2:45:18] <SilverJakler> BaBa Must Win
[2:45:33] <Chronomancer_Supreme> Nice PrettyGood
[2:45:38] <$RilsRislan> Do the extras-
[2:45:49] <+napargonaga> Pretty nice!
[2:45:49] <+PeaceCentennial> KEKE IS DEFEAT
[2:45:53] <worldbrand> You're not wrong, but some of them are the only hints this game can give
[2:45:55] <JigsK> @nukedahippies a good idea, but you cant walk onto text (it has a built in push rule)
[2:45:55] <the_sprankton> I remember this level being awful.
[2:45:57] <@Menitta> It should be like Seinfeld episode names
[2:45:58] <gigacanuck> nyahahahahaha get mindtricked Woolie
[2:46:00] <@Menitta> The Baba
[2:46:03] <NukeDaHippies> Killer Is Dead
[2:46:06] <deafmutelaughing> keke why
[2:46:09] <+PeaceCentennial> KILL KEKE
[2:46:10] <SilverJakler> KeKe is Vergil

[2:46:14] <lautalocos> mitochondria is HOT
[2:46:14] <MayorRev> Keke BibleThump
[2:46:15] <$RilsRislan> The Baba is Yaga

[2:47:40] <Mendin> Skull is Mitochondria, Bolt is getting... HOT?!?!
[2:48:16] <%ChoculaUltra> why can't I take off this sweater. I'M HOT
[2:48:29] <worldbrand> Thinking. and puzzles. and thinking. and pushing
[2:48:34] <JigsK> ahh, i remember the solution now
[2:48:38] <gigacanuck> Frustration is getting bigger
[2:48:40] <ghostravens> ARCANA HEART is DOWNLOADED
[2:49:11] <Mendin> Oh I think I see but that's a bit of finesse
[2:49:12] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:49:23] <coracor> fuck you keke
[2:49:24] <damienlunas> I don't see it at all
[2:49:26] <SelfMaidMan> DEVIL TRIGGER is PULL
[2:49:34] <gigacanuck> Woolie, my man
[2:49:36] <InsomniacPersona> I think I see the answer
[2:49:41] <gigacanuck> you are not even looking in the right place
[2:49:49] <maskedmustelid> URSAIN is BOLT
[2:49:52] <%fatal_penguin_> Projared is Defeat
[2:50:04] <worldbrand> i really dont think ive seen this level and i've cleared most of the game
[2:50:05] <dee388> granblue is cygames, cygames is money
[2:50:10] <seylumiue> Woolie is crash
[2:50:12] <+napargonaga> Cool, I think I see it.
[2:50:16] <damienlunas> Waaait I think I might see it
[2:50:51] <NukeDaHippies> John Travolta Is Bolt
[2:50:52] <MayorRev> brain is confused
[2:50:55] <maskedmustelid> skill is move?
[2:50:58] <maskedmustelid> *skull
[2:51:06] <coracor> Baba is Hot 🤔
[2:51:11] <gigacanuck> Woolie needs to try these earlier in the day when his brain is sharper
[2:51:15] <deafmutelaughing> bwaaaaa is you
[2:51:20] <dee388> skull is push?
[2:51:23] <patrickIy> Woolie almost has it.
[2:51:28] <$cureneckbeard> ! SUNDOWNING !
[2:51:33] <nobody12349> You could solve it without bolt
[2:51:46] <CheekyBirb> y'all, you can't skull is move or push with defeat in the way
[2:51:48] <NukeDaHippies> I think you need to make skull move
[2:51:48] <%fatal_penguin_> BIBLEBLACK is CLUB
[2:51:55] <JigsK> can you? i think you need bolt
[2:52:01] <InsomniacPersona> RACE is WAR
[2:52:01] <coracor> !WOOLIE AT RISK!
[2:52:12] <arkv01> woolie is DEVIL TRIGGERING
[2:52:13] <MayorRev> BRAIN IS STOP
[2:52:14] <deafmutelaughing> no wait if it's not push can't you push defeat there and ignore the bolt?
[2:52:15] <%Chichen> WOOLIE IS RISK
[2:52:17] <+the_saddest_man> Brain is Defeat
[2:52:20] <ghostravens> WOOLIE is RISK
[2:52:23] <+napargonaga> Sentence is move?
[2:52:26] <MrLittleSam> Woolie is Broken
[2:52:29] <scoot_io> Woolie is fry
[2:52:43] <seylumiue> Time is cube
[2:52:47] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> WATASHI GA KITA
[2:52:48] <nobody12349> 2 paths to win
[2:52:55] <SilverJakler> Earth is Flat
[2:53:02] <NukeDaHippies> Darlington Is Crush
[2:53:13] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie will figure it out
[2:53:18] <%fatal_penguin_> Danearys is Defeat
[2:53:18] <SelfMaidMan> can't you just pull the win block out?
[2:53:19] <JigsK> lol
[2:53:19] <Man_in_the_Red> @poweredscoot baked?
[2:53:21] <gigacanuck> Woolie is Crash
[2:53:37] <pibbleton> Time Cube is Race War
[2:53:39] <Parapattern> Maybe make it so the bolt doesn't push things?
[2:53:50] <Man_in_the_Red> @gigacanuck FBBlock [NOT]
[2:53:53] <JigsK> pulling is not a thing
[2:53:55] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> can another word go instead of defeat?
[2:54:03] <OtterSlinger> Pulling is him pressing undo
[2:54:03] <%DedlokPM> @Parapattern you need the bolt to push something to win
[2:54:05] <TopLeftCenter> @SelfMaidMan You can't pull blocks, only push them. When it looks like he's pulling stuff he's undoing previous moves
[2:54:06] <+MagicBeanBurrito> are hot and defeat the same thing?
[2:54:12] <dee388> god DAMNIT KEKE
[2:54:13] <InsomniacPersona> put move or push behind defeat?
[2:54:25] <gigacanuck> kekekekekeke
[2:54:26] <worldbrand> He'd have to get Defeat out first
[2:54:29] <ireliaismaiwaifu> 2 paths one choice
[2:54:35] <InsomniacPersona> @MagickBurritoh no hot melts bolt but not kill baba
[2:54:35] <%DedlokPM> It's just a manner of what and the timing of it/where you are when you push it
[2:54:36] <gigacanuck> all according to KEKEiaku
[2:54:37] <MayorRev> WOOLIE IS WALL
[2:54:39] <JigsK> nooooo
[2:54:45] <NukeDaHippies> What happens if you make defeat move?
[2:54:46] <%DedlokPM> Want a hint?
[2:54:47] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> keke has slain us
[2:54:47] <Chronomancer_Supreme> Maybe use puch in the defeat corridor?
[2:54:48] <@Solidus_113> Katana is Zero?
[2:54:49] <vernardohunk93> just do it at the same time
[2:54:49] <scoot_io> Woolie is wall is stop
[2:54:52] <$FuqBoiSlim> woolie is given up
[2:54:52] <%Chichen> LIMIT IS BREAK
[2:54:53] <NickHatesSnow> Oh I see it
[2:54:54] <Chronomancer_Supreme> Push*
[2:54:54] <coracor> Keke really is defeat
[2:54:54] <SilverJakler> Wall is in fact Stop
[2:54:55] <Parapattern> Woolie IS stumped
[2:55:01] <maskedmustelid> PARTY is HARD
[2:55:02] <FacetiousAF> what's up with A for Wait?
[2:55:05] <JigsK> have you played this dedlok?
[2:55:06] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> Killer is Dead?
[2:55:06] <+skm742> @WoolieVersus If you're stuck on a level, feel free to try another one!
[2:55:07] <MrLittleSam> Keke is Raid Boss
[2:55:07] <+napargonaga> What is the stage named?
[2:55:08] <dee388> do words go through keke?
[2:55:13] <vernardohunk93> you dont need to get in front of defeat
[2:55:13] <DomunDomunDomun> Race the bolt.
[2:55:20] <%DedlokPM> @NJigglypuff no but I can see the answer
[2:55:23] <nobody12349> Walk down to go to the win
[2:55:27] <TechTurtle7> doodStare
[2:55:28] <JigsK> ah, k
[2:55:35] <coracor> oooooooh
[2:55:36] <coracor> okay
[2:55:37] <NukeDaHippies> What if....Bolt is defeat and move??
[2:55:56] <$RilsRislan> no and
[2:56:07] <NukeDaHippies> Do you lose? Or does it destroy everything?
[2:56:16] <+PeaceCentennial> baba is fuck
[2:56:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:56:17] <vernardohunk93> teamwork is bolt
[2:56:21] <Niney_Who> Woolie Is Mindflood
[2:56:26] <Shastafield> BIG resets
[2:56:32] <worldbrand> Catch is 22
[2:56:35] <ireliaismaiwaifu> "there's nothing you can do to win"
[2:56:41] <nobody12349> Woolie please
[2:56:43] <SixthSun2> We can't see the top of the screen, btw @WoolieVersus
[2:56:44] <+kknutson4> what can the bolt melt?
[2:56:49] <dee388> can words go through keke?
[2:57:09] <nobody12349> There is another way towards win
[2:57:10] <InkyDraconian> time your movements
[2:57:11] <worldbrand> the bolt doesn't melt other things, the bolt gets melted if it touches something hot
[2:57:13] <vernardohunk93> what does the A do?
[2:57:15] <NickHatesSnow> Can you pull defeat out?
[2:57:15] <+napargonaga> @kknutson4 nothing, the bolt itself melts if it hits something hot.
[2:57:17] <steelmorrigan> What if bolt wasn't push?
[2:57:22] <NukeDaHippies> What will happen to Bolt if it's defeat? you die or does it destroy things?
[2:57:22] <steelmorrigan> and was move?
[2:57:25] <InsomniacPersona> @vernardohunk93 it undos a move
[2:57:27] <panic_rabbit> oh I get it
[2:57:33] <%DedlokPM> @kknutson4 nothing. The Bolt Melts when it touches something Hot
[2:57:44] <+napargonaga> Oh?
[2:57:50] <DomunDomunDomun> hot destroys melt, defeat destroys you
[2:58:01] <worldbrand> But you're out of words
[2:58:05] <ireliaismaiwaifu> fail
[2:58:07] <+napargonaga> Almost
[2:58:08] <+kknutson4> k
[2:58:10] <Chronomancer_Supreme> THAT'S a good idea
[2:58:12] <InsomniacPersona> Almost
[2:58:18] <+Aztec50> apatHoldon apatHoldon
[2:58:19] <Chronomancer_Supreme> You're almost there!!!!
[2:58:22] <%DedlokPM> He got there in a different fashion than I was thinking but he had the same idea. teenYEY
[2:58:22] <SilverJakler> Defeat is Win
[2:58:23] <patrickIy> ALMOST Woolie PogChamp
[2:58:24] <dee388> keke IS FUCK
[2:58:29] <coracor> sacrifice words to get more time on the clock
[2:58:30] <nobody12349> You could already walk through the skulls
[2:58:41] <+pkmamsters> baba is hot
[2:58:49] <nobody12349> You did what you could have earlier
[2:59:01] <InsomniacPersona> you need push next to move
[2:59:02] <dee388> thats progress though
[2:59:04] <DomunDomunDomun> bolt must win
[2:59:24] <$FuqBoiSlim> Elmo came with that ak47
[2:59:54] <+Bowiie> Oh I think I see it
[2:59:58] <worldbrand> Did you?
[3:00:05] <+Bowiie> He was super close earlier
[3:00:07] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> Woolie big thinks
[3:00:46] <worldbrand> Question is Good
[3:00:52] <NukeDaHippies> Can he push all the words to keep bolt alive?
[3:01:15] <vernardohunk93> bolt is race
[3:01:16] <Nyckelus> Getting closer!
[3:01:27] <%ChoculaUltra> he's tasting it
[3:01:35] <CheekyBirb> i can taste it too
[3:01:43] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> Woolie is Think
[3:02:24] <worldbrand> botl is vertical
[3:02:40] <%DedlokPM> it blows up because bolt is hot and bolt is melt. because the melt thing "touched" a hot thing
[3:02:49] <dee388> bolt is nalt son
[3:03:03] <worldbrand> He's so close hot damn
[3:03:19] <patrickIy> Yes Woolie YOUR SO CLOSE PogChamp
[3:03:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:03:28] <InsomniacPersona> BOLT is WIN Pog
[3:03:38] <SelfMaidMan> !uptime
[3:03:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 13 minutes
[3:03:45] <%Chichen> ya fucked it
[3:03:46] <+Bowiie> Does bolt keep moving even if Baba isn't you?
[3:03:50] <Nyckelus> Very close now! He’s almost there!
[3:03:50] <worldbrand> yes
[3:03:56] <patrickIy> You just gotta change one thing and that's it.
[3:04:19] <+waltzqueen> what level is this?
[3:04:33] <worldbrand> Brain is Bend
[3:04:42] <+PeaceCentennial> win
[3:04:59] <arkv01> sk c
[3:05:00] <worldbrand> for posterity: if an object is Defeat and Win, touching it will make you lose
[3:05:06] <coracor> HOLD ON HOLD ON
[3:05:07] <arkv01> wind is pushing you
[3:05:09] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> So, I actually got around to the kirby lore videos. Shit was dope.
[3:05:11] <+linSP> BIG hold on
[3:05:34] <%DedlokPM> apatBig apatHoldon
[3:05:39] <dee388> OH
[3:05:45] <worldbrand> hahaha
[3:05:46] <dee388> i think it clicked for me
[3:05:55] <dee388> puuuush
[3:05:58] <+Nekheny> triHmm
[3:06:13] <Hammatime8> I think I have an idea. I can hold it, though.
[3:06:17] <Nyckelus> Woolie’s making it a bit more complicated than need be.
[3:06:20] <%DedlokPM> He's got the fundementals. Just needs to work on the execution.
[3:06:24] <$RilsRislan> Push push
[3:06:32] <worldbrand> You have the right idea but made a bad assumption
[3:06:35] <CheekyBirb> LUL
[3:06:37] <+BurningCouches> does bolt is move have to be there
[3:06:46] <+PeaceCentennial> I don't think it does
[3:06:51] <patrickIy> No @BurningCouches it doesn't LUL
[3:06:52] <CheekyBirb> idk, i think you're missing a piece
[3:06:54] <+PeaceCentennial> it can just be the bolt
[3:06:58] <$RilsRislan> Move something else down the top hole
[3:07:13] <Klarrann3> win needs to connect to something
[3:07:15] <Hammatime8> I think he's trying to avoid reading chat to avoid spoilers.
[3:07:16] <vernardohunk93> he could just have push stacked on the bolt and race to the win
[3:07:18] <worldbrand> LUL
[3:07:21] <InkyDraconian> what else can the bolt push
[3:07:23] <vernardohunk93> its so simple
[3:07:29] <+waltzqueen> IKR baba is you is great but also pain
[3:07:37] <MayorRev> BRAIN is STOP
[3:07:49] <worldbrand> It's SUCH a leap
[3:07:50] <ck1755> move bolt down to push you and in into "bolt is"
[3:07:53] <+Bowiie> The turning gears is real good
[3:07:54] <+BurningCouches> i play this game ten minutes at a time lol
[3:07:55] <dee388> i dont wanna give it away now but woole need help
[3:08:02] <gigacanuck> aaaaahhhhhh
[3:08:02] <Niney_Who> Win is defeat
[3:08:03] <%DedlokPM> The bolt could also push nothing.
[3:08:04] <+PeaceCentennial> nah don't help him
[3:08:07] <CheekyBirb> LUL
[3:08:08] <dee388> ye
[3:08:13] <HitchhikingThrough> @ck1755 I don't think it would work.
[3:08:13] <Man_in_the_Red> if theres control prompts its a tutorial Kappa
[3:08:14] <gigacanuck> AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
[3:08:22] <scoot_io> all you have to do is make you win though
[3:08:22] <Nyckelus> You got this Woolie! Just keep thinking about it.
[3:08:25] <worldbrand> ahahahahahaha

[3:08:38] <patrickIy> Brain is Big
[3:08:43] <$RilsRislan> Do you need to move the sentence?
[3:08:46] <+PeaceCentennial> woolie is brain

[3:09:07] <Mallaes> MIND is BLOWN
[3:09:12] <%DedlokPM> there is 3 things out of place
[3:09:20] <worldbrand> he's so sure
[3:09:21] <Man_in_the_Red> Woolie is well known for overthinking things to the point he gets it completly wrong Kappa
[3:09:21] <HitchhikingThrough> Wait, what if the bolt just pushed "PUSH"
[3:09:23] <wwylele> LUL I have seen many people pushing BOLT IS MOVE into the tunnel
[3:09:24] <CheekyBirb> I'M LOSING MY SHIT
[3:09:30] <dee388> poosh
[3:09:42] <vernardohunk93> @Youwereeatenbyalid thats what he needs to do
[3:09:45] <$RilsRislan> I think the bolt is move thing is a common step to learning about the race
[3:09:53] <Hammatime8> He's gonna have to reset this one.
[3:09:55] <@Menitta> keke is bitch

[3:11:06] <worldbrand> Unfigure one out
[3:11:07] <$RilsRislan> You're so close, but you have an extra step you don't need
[3:11:08] <Chronomancer_Supreme> Wowee Wowee Wowee
[3:11:11] <Hammatime8> I think the answer is WAY different from what he's doing.

[3:56:41] <Thirtine> Cool that’s there’s a bit of branching paths, makes for interesting lore
[3:56:45] <gslayer14> i'll explain when he gets back to the therapist
[3:56:54] <+Aztec50> from woolie abridged
[3:56:57] <deafmutelaughing> it does not!
[3:56:57] <Captain_Stimpy> yooooo katana zero for sure sleeper hit of the year
[3:56:58] <RiceeFTW> there is most definitely a no-slomo option
[3:56:58] <spacecatstreams> theres a boss fight in this game i missed entirely apparently
[3:56:59] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus I tweeted you a clip of you sneaking and dancing
[3:57:04] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeah you can totally play this game without the slowdown
[3:57:11] <%DatLatinoGuy> just need better timing tho
[3:57:14] <RiceeFTW> @spacecatstreams yes, he is pretty cool
[3:57:26] <+charp35> hey @WoolieVersus do you know about the secret boss?
[3:57:27] <CirclesForever> the sprite art is nice in this game
[3:57:37] <LTKonnor> NO BULLY
[3:57:39] <+crimsonharvest> That's awesome
[3:57:42] <CirclesForever> the animations are also nice
[3:57:45] <%ChoculaUltra> Katana Zero's on sale on the Nintendo eShop rn btw.
[3:57:52] <deafmutelaughing> why are you so rude to her
[3:57:58] <Thunderhog> slo mo just basicly gives you better frame imput time. if your a speed runer you got your inputs on point
[3:58:13] <a_mad_dragon> ziz gets no love
[3:58:45] <spacecatstreams> how does the speedrun mode handle these scenes?
[3:58:47] <gslayer14> simurgh best endbringer fight me
[3:58:54] <RiceeFTW> it skips it
[3:59:01] <RiceeFTW> it skips dialogue and cinematics that aren't "action"
[3:59:06] <Thirtine> @spacecatstreams you can just turn them off completely
[3:59:13] <televisedrevolting> I hate how attached I became to this tiny being.
[3:59:15] <SixthSun2> That red was concerning
[3:59:23] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus do you know about the secret boss
[3:59:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> why do you have a loli sidekick?
[3:59:40] <CirclesForever> leviathan is a fish with a big mouth
[3:59:49] <QaizerArt> BE NICE-A TO DA CHIIILD
[3:59:52] <%jinking79> letting little girl in your house to bad it not 1960 anymore can't use that card to get out of jail
[3:59:57] <clapbeat> this kid has good taste in names
[3:59:57] <+crimsonharvest> i hope she has more toys named after Satan

[4:03:43] <@Menitta> the Druginator
[4:03:44] <%DatLatinoGuy> ohhh this is gon b gud
[4:03:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> look at this badass
[4:03:48] <QaizerArt> YEAAAAH, THIS LEVEL
[4:03:59] <spacecatstreams> i never bothered with the stealth
[4:04:00] <+griffball13> remember snake this is a stealth mission
[4:04:00] <FacetiousAF> kill everyone loud, got it
[4:04:09] <gslayer14> is this level actually possible to stealth?
[4:04:12] <RiceeFTW> yes
[4:04:17] <gslayer14> really
[4:04:19] <gslayer14> huh
[4:04:19] <QaizerArt> @gslayer14 Yeah. Just tough as fuck.
[4:04:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kill them all, Woolie
[4:04:20] <Thirtine> Oh yeah, let’s start going OFF THE RAILS
[4:04:22] <QaizerArt> I've done it.
[4:04:23] <%DatLatinoGuy> I actually managed to stealth it all the way, frustrating as fuck tho
[4:04:38] <RiceeFTW> 100% yes and it is even crucial to the story
[4:04:39] <QaizerArt> You get a sick reward for stealthing it 100%, no kills.
[4:04:43] <ghostravens> time to get silent hill as fuck boys!
[4:04:43] <spacecatstreams> apparently the new update "fixed" the stealth level
[4:04:44] <Ion_Laser> Well shit...
[4:04:48] <spacecatstreams> according to justins twitter
[4:04:55] <gslayer14> i was too weak then
[4:04:55] <+griffball13> game over man game over
[4:04:59] <Parapattern> The extra amount of effort to hang a dude after killing him
[4:05:01] <LTKonnor> This isn't going according to Keikaku at all
[4:05:04] <MayorRev> marioooo
[4:05:09] <+cyclonova> they're already dead? damn, you're good
[4:05:17] <Quikanims> are we about to fight Biker?
[4:05:17] <MayorRev> J A S O N
[4:05:18] <+JustToWatch> SEAN
[4:05:19] <Thirtine> MonkaS
[4:05:21] <Ion_Laser> JAY-SON
[4:05:23] <LTKonnor> JAYSON
[4:05:27] <usurper_sos> Aww that reminds me of Matt
[4:05:27] <FacetiousAF> monkaS
[4:05:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> TETSUO
[4:05:28] <spacecatstreams> this must be the work of some kind of dragon
[4:05:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh hes dead
[4:05:35] <Zineta> IT'S A TRAP
[4:05:43] <gslayer14> wow the dragon is really strong
[4:05:46] <%DatLatinoGuy> KILL THEM ALL
[4:05:50] <Thirtine> Oh shit
[4:05:51] <CirclesForever> is the plot twist that this is a drug induced hallucination
[4:05:54] <spacecatstreams> ope its murder time
[4:06:02] <deafmutelaughing> apparently you don't have to kill any of the cops here but I couldn't do it
[4:06:02] <+OverlordAshwader> SourPls
[4:06:05] <RiceeFTW> @CirclesForever no
[4:06:07] <+arancet> trying to stealth this level is what made me stop playing the game, it got so annoying
[4:06:09] <HawkGoggles2> The stealth run feels like something that was expected to do on the second playthrough.
[4:06:17] <Thirtine> @circlesforever nah that’s lame
[4:06:17] <usurper_sos> You really tried it
[4:06:27] <spacecatstreams> @Quikanims no but the biker fight is coming
[4:06:30] <LTKonnor> What kind of masochist would try to stealth this level
[4:06:40] <HawkGoggles2> Me.
[4:06:41] <RiceeFTW> you actually unlock something for doing so
[4:06:57] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeyye it's frustrating but possible
[4:07:02] <+spacehouse> Aww, no secret boss i guess
[4:07:13] <CirclesForever> gucci gang
[4:07:18] <sunny_side_up> it only took me like 20 attempts to stealth it 4Head
[4:07:20] <MayorRev> there's a secret boss?
[4:07:26] <correctedsun117> We are not pleased
[4:07:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:07:32] <%DatLatinoGuy> took me an hour to stealth it
[4:07:35] <+griffball13> wanna know how to unlock it
[4:07:37] <+spacehouse> aww
[4:07:44] <ghostravens> oh fuck this part
[4:07:51] <RiceeFTW> it's too convoluted to unlock it first playthrough on accident
[4:07:56] <Spagheddies> I can tell you that most other streamers I've watched play this game tried to stealth this level and gave up about 10 minutes in.
[4:08:18] <HawkGoggles2> But here's the deal, the secret item you get for this level is dependent on your actions before hand. You either get by stealthing it or killing everyone.
[4:08:18] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus be rude to your psychiatrist at every oppertunity and don't do what he says
[4:08:24] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus you already missed it, you had to have pissed off the receptionist at the hotel and talk to Electrohead
[4:08:33] <+haseoseerlane> I'm pretty sure you just have to say fuck you every chance you talk to the psych
[4:08:33] <%DatLatinoGuy> buy this game and it's on sale atm too!!!
[4:08:34] <%ChoculaUltra> its 12 bucks on the Nintendo eShop rn if ya'll got switches.
[4:08:34] <+MillerLowlife> this game is dope on all fronts
[4:08:35] <spacecatstreams> katana zero briefly filled the hotline miami shaped hole in my soul
[4:08:43] <deafmutelaughing> I lost interest in this game but I'm glad I bought it
[4:08:52] <+filthydrongo> is this on the switch?
[4:08:53] <+spacehouse> Antagonize the therapist in prologue, don't kill DJ, interrupt therapist
[4:08:56] <%Akanesasusora> you don't need to kill the receptionist. you just need to make your psychiatrist super pissed
[4:09:08] <%johnny_gogo> Yeah im playing through hard right now
[4:09:13] <clapbeat> you have to fuck up every mission
[4:09:18] <%johnny_gogo> its WAY harder
[4:09:22] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus basicly make a scene at every opertunity
[4:09:23] <correctedsun117> Everyone's been recommending this game to me. Looks dope.
[4:09:25] <+spacehouse> receptionist kill not required
[4:09:26] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, cromag is strong.
[4:09:28] <clapbeat> and never talk to the psych
[4:09:34] <Thirtine> Yeah it’s pretty complicated to get the secret boss
[4:09:35] <spacecatstreams> you can kill the receptionist?
[4:09:36] <spacecatstreams> wow
[4:09:38] <+MagicBeanBurrito> RACE WAR
[4:09:43] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you can do it through chapter select if you want so no big
[4:09:46] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Race war lore
[4:09:48] <CirclesForever> cro magnon
[4:10:05] <sunny_side_up> wait i've never seen that before
[4:10:08] <+MillerLowlife> yeah its pretty quick to do all of it through level select
[4:10:23] <%johnny_gogo> WAIT YOU CAN WALK AWAY
[4:10:27] <%johnny_gogo> what
[4:10:27] <+filthydrongo> @WoolieVersus what is this game on?
[4:10:28] <@Menitta> dumb hair
[4:10:37] <+haseoseerlane> Be a jerk and indulge in self interests against the pyschs orders then?
[4:10:39] <+MagicBeanBurrito> you have to shit on the therapist
[4:10:41] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Hang up and demand medicine, Pissed off receptionist, talk to Electrohead, refuse meds, kill all officers, tell psych FUCK YOU, if you get told "I’m almost disappointed that you’re still alive, after what you’ve put me through." by the psych, the final psych session will have the boss fight.
[4:10:48] <@Menitta> @filthydrongo Switch/PC.
[4:10:48] <tattleworm> yeah i've beat the game twice and i thought the hobo was a guaranteed kill
[4:10:50] <%DatLatinoGuy> Switch and PC
[4:10:57] <+filthydrongo> yoooooo heck yeah
[4:11:02] <HawkGoggles2> @johnny_gogo I'm pretty sure if you kill him one, you will always kill the hobo.
[4:11:07] <clapbeat> this scene is not ok
[4:11:15] <ghostravens> this scene fucked me up badly
[4:11:33] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeah this scene is rough
[4:11:33] <LTKonnor> chiki chiki~
[4:11:36] <sunny_side_up> at least the music is good LUL
[4:11:37] <%DatLatinoGuy> not good times
[4:11:42] <Thirtine> Yeah this part is fucked in a true-to-this kind of game way
[4:11:44] <SixthSun2> dude bro dude
[4:11:57] <clapbeat> i could do without this tbh
[4:12:00] <spacecatstreams> cyka guy
[4:12:03] <correctedsun117> CHEEKI BREEKI
[4:12:10] <%DatLatinoGuy> damn cyka blat
[4:12:18] <%johnny_gogo> @HawkGoggles2 Thats crazy
[4:12:19] <Thirtine> V is genuinely a fucked up dude
[4:12:20] <+MillerLowlife> the way they do the text in this game is so good
[4:12:20] <@Menitta> did the letters from thhe textbox just fall
[4:12:24] <%johnny_gogo> God i love this game
[4:12:33] <%DatLatinoGuy> this game is trippy as fuck
[4:12:45] <Thirtine> @menitta yep! Dynamic text!
[4:12:46] <Spagheddies> This whole snuff tape thing felt inapproriately appropriate for a cyberpunk game.
[4:12:50] <@Menitta> Dank
[4:12:54] <Shastafield> LUL
[4:13:02] <@Menitta> Wait is the plot of this game like Dredd 2013
[4:13:05] <%johnny_gogo> it appeals to my edgy side alot
[4:13:07] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[4:13:09] <correctedsun117> Those sound effects...
[4:13:13] <Spagheddies> And the sound design is so fucking good too.
[4:13:18] <%DatLatinoGuy> you're in for a trip, Menita
[4:13:19] <ghostravens> yeah this part made me stop playing for a while
[4:13:47] <%DatLatinoGuy> rip neighbors
[4:13:56] <Thirtine> Oof
[4:14:08] <ghostravens> absolutely fucking not
[4:14:10] <%Man_of_cupS> Man_of_cupS subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[4:14:11] <correctedsun117> When the world is gray, the bad guys have to be black as night
[4:14:12] <Spagheddies> "that's pretty fucked" If I couldn't guess you've played the game already I'd be laughing.
[4:14:15] <ghostravens> the bad guys are hyper evil
[4:14:15] <@Menitta> these cutscenes are really high quality for 2D sprites
[4:14:17] <+Xeno351> so everyone is basically a shit got it
[4:14:19] <+Adriangabs> Bad guys are Bad
[4:14:20] <wakeuplvl3> "are we the baddies"
[4:14:26] <+linSP> just because you are bad guy does not mean you are bad guy
[4:14:31] <Thirtine> And even mr katana zero himself thinks that’s fucked up
[4:14:31] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
