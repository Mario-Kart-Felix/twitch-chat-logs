[0:12:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:13:04] <leith_aziz> @seydaq PS2 has exclusive content
[0:13:05] <dds333a> @seydaq I think it is
[0:13:06] <+Jiggisnipe> 5 is fun co-op
[0:13:17] <$SulfurousAcid> FORCED to play 5 peepoSad
[0:13:19] <%Lion_kun> Same.
[0:13:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> GC version is, graphically, MUCH better than the PS2 version
[0:13:23] <dds333a> Wii RE4 is also surprisingly good
[0:13:30] <SlangPunk> @seydaq For every game that were in those Consoles, the answer us normally yes
[0:13:33] <Ashrox117> It blew my mind that I played it first in 2018 and it felt great to play
[0:13:39] <leith_aziz> RE1R was my first. Didnt even complete it sadly. Horror and puzzle games arent my thing
[0:13:40] <NeroInfinite> I started on 4 too but it was by my own choice.
[0:13:42] <%BisoromiBear> Dead Space > RE4
[0:13:46] <andre11dr> Wii RE4 is easy as shit tho
[0:13:46] <JetpackMcQuack> monkaS 2004
[0:13:46] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:13:48] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie and Arkham Asylum
[0:13:52] <%waltzqueen> that's a hard thing to do
[0:13:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Same here, RE4 was my first one, I saw the others and they didnt really seem my style
[0:13:58] <%seydaq> @leith_aziz didnt know, thanks. played the ps2v
[0:14:00] <dds333a> @jiggisnipe exactly SeemsGood
[0:14:02] <JetpackMcQuack> it's almost 20 :)

[2:06:18] <%waltzqueen> @mighty_max_t Nocturne
[2:06:22] <+Ultimate_Edge> Maybe there's calculated cash value on the held items?
[2:06:25] <%patriotrenegade> The greatest Dokapon Warrior is whoever is dead and poor.
[2:06:25] <%topendbuzza> game just needs a turn guys
[2:06:29] <RubeTheRogue> @mighty_max_t Bravely default
[2:06:32] <andre11dr> @mighty_max_t Nocturne
[2:06:33] <%SulfurousAcid> Nocturne9 @mighty_max_t
[2:06:38] <IFlaske> bravely default 2 is good but short
[2:06:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:06:41] <%RyTYoung> @mighty_max_t I'm playing SMT V rn you should get that Kappa

[2:06:57] <GingaNZ> there iis an assets tab
[2:06:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I dunno
[2:07:01] <average_size_ant> @WoolieVersus it was just the turn order at the time
[2:07:08] <%mighty_max_t> @RyTYoung Already beat it, my dude LUL
[2:07:16] <average_size_ant> just the turn order

[2:09:21] <%topendbuzza> see pockets is now 1st
[2:09:24] <pedro_jose461> you need some HP
[2:09:28] <%topendbuzza> game needs a turn
[2:09:38] <Hammatime8> He can't even use the contract because Reggie is in last LUL
[2:09:40] <GingaNZ> 1st baby
[2:09:40] <RubeTheRogue> @topendbuzza He just got a town, that made the difference.
[2:09:41] <DedlokPM> Now Pockets is in first.
[2:09:49] <%topendbuzza> lol no

[2:10:27] <DedlokPM> @topendbuzza that doesn't explain how kicks got booted to 3rd
[2:10:30] <%SulfurousAcid> →_←♪ finally in 2nd
[2:10:39] <%topendbuzza> he went to last not 2nd because the game needed a turn
[2:10:43] <+Jiggisnipe> the game caught up
[2:10:47] <+Jiggisnipe> so Reggie is last now
[2:10:54] <Hammatime8> The game just needed to catch up earler
[2:10:58] <Hammatime8> *earlier
[2:11:07] <%topendbuzza> yes minh
[2:11:21] <%debrv> You got more cash, Minh.
[2:11:31] <GingaNZ> kings value in kingdom is called local item value
[2:11:32] <%topendbuzza> wes reg is right
[2:11:35] <%mighty_max_t> @RyTYoung Same here. I did my first playthrough on easy and am now doing NG+ on hard, trying to finish the compendium. I kinda got bit by the SMT bug so I was leaning towards Nocturne anyway, chat just confirmed it, haha
[2:11:37] <pedro_jose461> it must be a glitch
[2:11:37] <%topendbuzza> yes*
[2:12:05] <DedlokPM> Minh was promoted to 2nd before he took his turn. So it just needed someone to take their turn to update
[2:12:31] <+Grayhammatter> not a single thing
[2:12:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Kappa
[2:13:23] <%Solidnick18> very rough
[2:13:40] <pedro_jose461> pockets trying to get to end game but RNG gods dont let him
[2:13:46] <+Jiggisnipe> he just needs stronger magic
[2:13:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:13:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Idiot Dokapon Spiral
[2:13:54] <+Jiggisnipe> Aurora > Heckfire for instance

[2:14:34] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, SP and HP, minh will be unstoppable
[2:14:58] <RubeTheRogue> Sigma Minh. Sigminh.
[2:15:03] <pedro_jose461> reggie can kill him with magic @grayhammatter
[2:15:09] <GingaNZ> its just stronger gust
[2:16:13] <%seydaq> chenSigma
[2:16:35] <RubeTheRogue> Reggie has to become more evil to abuse how broken field magic is.

[2:17:26] <OblivionSword1> it adds to the humor
[2:17:34] <%DashXero> "Please enjoy getting screwed."
[2:17:42] <RubeTheRogue> The hero'ing economy crashed, the bubble burst, all heros are now in the dumpster.

[2:19:17] <pedro_jose461> @majorcrasher Instakills opponents at the cost of leaving you at 1 HP

[2:53:05] <JetpackMcQuack> who finished AC1
[2:53:06] <@Solidus_113> they gave up at Origins
[2:53:07] <%mighty_max_t> In Odyssey, that only is a thing in Modern Day
[2:53:08] <OldManDeckardCain> even ubisoft doesn't know wtf AC is about anymore tbh

[2:53:37] <Insectorbass> Yes it's still about assassins and templars. No it's not going ANYWHERE because sequel sequel sequel.
[2:53:47] <%Solidnick18> desmond was in origin i think
[2:53:51] <%thesw1tch> assassin's creed: some of the worst long-term storytelling in any form of media
[2:53:54] <%Solidnick18> but i forget
[2:53:56] <%tyler274> desmond's corpse was mentioned in origin iirc
[2:54:11] <%tyler274> like they showed footage of his ass getting burned to a crisp somewhere
[2:54:27] <+Grayhammatter> more than enough, jeez
[2:54:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tyler274 you get top watch the autopsy in 4
[2:54:34] <Insectorbass> In AC black flag it's implied they pulled the memories of Kenway from Desmonds brain in a jar.
[2:54:37] <OblivionSword1> desmond's corpse has been referenced all the wway from black flag
[2:54:47] <%tyler274> yea that

[3:05:21] <%townzzzzz> be sol badguy
[3:05:36] <+SlappyMeats> @RyTYoung My feelings on GWAR; I haven't dug into their stuff after losing Oderous

[3:05:49] <Insectorbass> @miucsa51 Sick! I always wanted to see them live and get covered in foam nut.
[3:05:53] <DasFreekman> ill take my payment in monero
[3:06:00] <andre11dr> @insectorbass Rammstien where kinda of a mix of alt metal and Nu Metal
[3:06:04] <+Jiggisnipe> it's just buying immediately upon being paid
[3:06:06] <%Solidnick18> eh

[3:08:22] <AutolycusLive> Dokapon is the Dark Souls of board games
[3:08:25] <andre11dr> I will recognize, it took me a long time to learn to respect the Black Parade

[3:08:37] <%notsoy> YOU DIED
[3:08:44] <%RyTYoung> @miucsa51 oh god definitely not, exactly the same as Queen no one could replace Freddie
[3:08:44] <glass_marcus> Darksouls could never be as brutal as this
[3:08:56] <Insectorbass> @RyTYoung The anti-Breaking Benjamin, where the frontman found out that the band were baking back alley deals behind his back and fired the entire band.
[3:09:04] <%notsoy> if dark souls had native MP beyond just invasions, they would absolutely do shit like this lmao
[3:09:07] <legacy0117> Riggyt Wreckt.

[3:11:06] <@Moobot> @Shady_Zaku WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 20 minutes
[3:11:57] <Insectorbass> @RyTYoung I think it was that they made some deal with their record distributor without including him or something similar to that.
[3:12:54] <%RyTYoung> @miucsa51 that sucks dude there's nothing worse than knowing the band you like aren't going to put out new stuff

[3:15:30] <%RyTYoung> @humandoctor that's ancient for rockers LUL

[3:18:45] <miucsa51> @andre11dr snort the coke for extra time on the clock
[3:18:59] <Insectorbass> Lemmy was once pulled over because police found blood in his system.
[3:19:00] <%RyTYoung> @insectorbass  Yeah Lemmy was a badass

[3:20:49] <Insectorbass> @RyTYoung Anyone asks me "Why do you like lemmy" i send them the video of him reacting to a black kid sending him a letter about his dad hating him for liking metal because it was "white" music. Dude was progressive when it game to personal liberty.

[5:20:07] <Leonheart777> @paladinstarbuster it does not
[5:20:11] <Astrophizz> sajamSol
[5:20:17] <dds333a> his passive
[5:20:31] <dds333a> it reduced it by a not bad percentage
[5:20:32] <%fetrigon> bruh minh is tanky as fuck
[5:20:36] <legacy0117> PJSalt
[5:20:38] <Leonavius> unbreakable
[5:20:42] <dds333a> not as broken as the other two, but still LUL
[5:20:45] <%fetrigon> jesus fuck
[5:20:46] <+paladinstarbuster> it does in the booklet
[5:20:47] <%SulfurousAcid> it's probably in the instruction manual
[5:20:51] <Insectorbass> Minh playing to his class. Paladin as fuck
[5:20:57] <TheDoctorHobo> @dds333a thanks for the info
[5:20:58] <%Solidnick18> Dokapon up?
[5:20:59] <Astrophizz> they gotta translate the 2020 one

[5:21:05] <RubeTheRogue> Unbreakable and unstoppable.
[5:21:05] <dds333a> Like Mage has a stupid passive LUL
[5:21:08] <JeoDood> instructions
[5:21:15] <dds333a> @thedoctorhobo sure thing
[5:21:16] <+Jiggisnipe> you should get knowledge of the classes at least lol
[5:21:22] <+pingu_crimson> i wouldn't mind another kingdom run
[5:21:29] <nintega010> knowledge of classes
[5:21:30] <+terry_quest> maybe just look at the character traits
[5:21:32] <JetpackMcQuack> The other side of the coin
[5:21:33] <%fetrigon> nah this game has plenty of surprise
[5:21:37] <dds333a> healing LUL
[5:21:41] <Insectorbass> Someone in the community could put together a spoiler-free guide?
[5:21:47] <+Grayhammatter> gotta go for woolie now LUL
[5:21:52] <Duskendawn> Yeah just rerun kingdom
[5:21:54] <%fetrigon> just planning your build before hand
[5:21:55] <+pectusumbra> That's completely fair. That said it's not likely to happen again any time soon unless you go for a 2nd gig or some shit
[5:21:59] <+Adalore> where the "Content" comes from

[5:22:20] <nintega010> if dokapon up ever gets translated
[5:22:23] <miucsa51> blessed
[5:22:24] <%DashXero> It's also a really old one.

[5:22:33] <%SulfurousAcid> #2blessed2bestressed
[5:22:37] <%undersea_magic> too annointed to be disappointed
[5:22:41] <dds333a> @dashxero sure is LUL
[5:22:44] <RubeTheRogue> Dokapon The World would be the hypest localization
[5:22:51] <+Jiggisnipe> and Woolie got another mirror
[5:22:51] <TheDoctorHobo> do you think they'd play the fan translation of UP, or the fan balance patch if Kingdom?
[5:22:55] <+Grayhammatter> another mirror, wow
[5:23:03] <nintega010> @astrophizz not that i know of
[5:23:06] <+paladinstarbuster> Yeah blessing should have a % chance to work the number is too high to work every time
[5:23:13] <+Shady_Zaku> doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[5:23:27] <dds333a> Soothe, specifically
[5:23:40] <+Jiggisnipe> so Endure always happens?
[5:23:42] <nintega010> @thedoctorhobo what does kingdom fan patch do?
[5:23:43] <RubeTheRogue> @TheDoctorHobo The Fan Balance Patch addresses broken strategies that Woolie, Minh, and Reggie never even got close to touching.
[5:23:48] <%Solidnick18> blessing
[5:24:02] <dds333a> @rubetherogue like the alchemist shit?
[5:24:05] <%Solidnick18> it's not gonna work unless you fight him
[5:24:10] <hawmaro95> should just nuke woolie maybe, Minh aint dying lol
[5:24:15] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[5:24:29] <+pectusumbra> @hawmaro95 can he even hit woolie?
[5:24:34] <+2sappy> Vegeta is not cool
[5:24:41] <+Grayhammatter> he might be able to
[5:24:43] <dds333a> vegeta isn't cool though LUL
[5:24:49] <TheDoctorHobo> @rubetherogue  yeah, but you know Minh wouldn't next time if he had the prep
[5:24:49] <RubeTheRogue> @dds333a Exactly, or buying Come Heres from Lava Cave to toxically stall the game out.
[5:24:56] <andre11dr> Interesting that Reggie is attacking Minh when Woolie is in first and doesn't have the health to tank it
[5:24:59] <dds333a> @2sappy  yeah exactly LUL
[5:25:00] <%Solidnick18> Reggie is just stalling LUL
[5:25:03] <Arqartur0> Reggie, at least you’re not the Red Ribbon army
[5:25:06] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie got another mirror
[5:25:25] <+Grayhammatter> reggie didn't see the mirror get
[5:25:35] <andre11dr> He could break his mirror with another spell
[5:25:35] <TheDoctorHobo> * Minh would
[5:25:44] <Insectorbass> @2sappy I think Vegeta is a victim of the fact that "Goku must win" the killsteal in ressurection of F sucked.
[5:25:49] <dds333a> tricorn herds
[5:26:01] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[5:26:09] <jumpyhugs> I attack the darkness
[5:26:11] <dds333a> that's smart LUL
[5:26:11] <RubeTheRogue> Woolie needs to play more DnD
[5:26:12] <%Solidnick18> blind firing spells
[5:26:13] <%DashXero> Sounds like something that would happen in Goblin Slayer.
[5:26:16] <miucsa51> LUL
[5:26:18] <kulmoth> nuke the cave and then go loot
[5:26:21] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[5:26:22] <yeildingthought> LUL
[5:26:24] <+pectusumbra> That's how we smart cowards play yeah

[5:26:49] <+Shady_Zaku> @Insectorbass I caaaast....fiiirebaaaaaall
[5:26:59] <legacy0117> Sheesh are they level 80 something now?  X.x Or are still around 60 and 70?
[5:27:01] <+Jiggisnipe> it leaves him with under 10 hp
[5:27:02] <Insectorbass> @Shady_Zaku There's a house.
[5:27:30] <dds333a> drops him to 1 probably
[5:27:32] <%zephyboi> Oh shit, Minh has the gun now
[5:27:37] <Leonheart777> Does Glare say chance?
[5:27:40] <RubeTheRogue> @legacy0117 They're on the infini-grind.
[5:27:48] <+Jiggisnipe> it's magic right?
[5:27:51] <dds333a> glare is percentage basede yeah
[5:27:54] <legacy0117> Ahhhh….
[5:27:59] <OblivionSword1> reflect might work
[5:28:07] <dds333a> never
[5:28:15] <miucsa51> no
[5:28:16] <+pectusumbra> you'd have to use a defense magic in this game it seems
[5:28:18] <dds333a> magiv doesn't miss, it has to be defended
[5:28:26] <andre11dr> So let's recount, Minh has mega health, the best armour and an instant kill.....
[5:28:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:28:33] <dds333a> @pectusumbra exactly

[5:29:11] <Pookiedaexzile> NotLikeThis
[5:29:12] <+Grayhammatter> while reggie and woolie were playing chess, minh was playing tic-tac-toe
[5:29:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Minh over here doing patty-cake calculations
[5:29:24] <+pectusumbra> is it under weapon?
[5:29:29] <Duskendawn> Minh drawing O and X on the chessboard
[5:29:31] <+RJay80> While you was busy playing rock paper scissors i was studying tic tac toe
[5:29:32] <Insectorbass> I'm doing 1000 calculations per second and THEYRE ALL WRONG
[5:29:33] <dds333a> CHAMP
[5:29:54] <+Shady_Zaku> @Shady_Zaku I made a wizard, just to beat you. And the NPC for this  gamee...IS A WIZARD!
[5:30:07] <dds333a> Sunshine is probably stronger than the final boss, or the bottom of the list just has "special monsters"
[5:30:12] <Insectorbass> @Shady_Zaku COUNTERSPELL
[5:30:23] <+Shady_Zaku> @Insectorbass REFLECT
[5:30:25] <+pectusumbra> @dds333a sunshine is the best stats of all characters
[5:30:29] <+FistOcuffs9> counterspell the counterspell
[5:30:30] <dds333a> fights in fights
[5:30:58] <dds333a> @pectusumbra yeah, I'm aware, that's what I'm getting at. still I dont know if he actually is
[5:31:11] <Insectorbass> @Shady_Zaku *MEntal BreAKdwon*
[5:31:11] <dds333a> LUL
[5:31:13] <%DashXero> Could have joined the melee like a non-coward.
[5:31:43] <+Shady_Zaku> @Insectorbass doodScrub doodScrub doodScrub LMAO i love that fuckin channel
[5:31:47] <+pectusumbra> if woolie actually gets a good sword he can think about dealing with minh
[5:32:05] <dds333a> here we go LUL
[5:32:14] <+dollarstored> this backfired on reggie so hard
[5:32:16] <+dollarstored> i feel bad
[5:32:18] <dds333a> Wordsworth might win here
[5:32:26] <KyberNasse> where blood
[5:32:34] <dds333a> saved
[5:32:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Insectorbass
[5:32:55] <+pectusumbra> yoooo
[5:33:01] <Insectorbass> Dokapon smiles on reggarth this day.
[5:33:02] <%Solidnick18> ugh
[5:33:03] <+pectusumbra> damn it, so close
[5:33:07] <+Grayhammatter> god damn
[5:33:09] <+terry_quest> this is so busted
[5:33:11] <+Adalore> Never die master
[5:33:17] <dds333a> I have questions for dokapon god
[5:33:23] <+Adalore> been suffering in a fight for an ingame week
[5:33:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:33:59] <+paladinstarbuster> I dont think minh can die unless he gets one-shot
[5:34:05] <dds333a> pretty much, also, reg is really the only guy here with a mixup
[5:34:09] <%SirGO0SE> HP just a formality
[5:34:18] <dds333a> woolie and Minh are more one trick ponies
[5:34:20] <Insectorbass> Minh's playing tic tac toe. Reggie is playing Ro Sham Bo Woolies playing heads or tails.
[5:34:29] <+RJay80> Everything in life is a 50 50
[5:34:49] <+Grayhammatter> and minh is just there
[5:35:12] <+pectusumbra> this is why everyone's chomping for weapons
[5:35:24] <dds333a> @paladinstarbuster essentially they needs either the ohko, or to shutdown his options. the war of attrition is incredibly unlikely, if not impossible
[5:35:43] <glass_marcus> Reggie won't have a true mix up until he gets a better weapon
[5:35:57] <Insectorbass> "I only need to win once" said the big bad woolfie
[5:36:19] <Insectorbass> "You need to be lucky every night. I only need to be lucky once" *
[5:36:25] <Duskendawn> Bless is a luck LUL
[5:36:33] <dds333a> @insectorbass LUL
[5:36:49] <legacy0117> Lol.
[5:36:52] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh can put them in a blessing loop
[5:37:09] <dds333a> the worst thing about Minh to, is that none of them want to spend literal weeks locked in battle with him
[5:37:15] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:37:22] <%DashXero> Who said we thought you could win? We just want to see content.
[5:37:38] <Insectorbass> Doesn't one of the classes have an ability to silence one of your options in a fight?
[5:37:38] <dds333a> Minh could drag it out for as long as he wants to a degree LUL
[5:37:39] <+paladinstarbuster> @dds333a Yeah the solution i guess is to coma him
[5:37:41] <+RJay80> Come on do IIITT kill me come onnnn
[5:37:41] <Insectorbass> Silence bless
[5:38:00] <dds333a> @rjay80 I'M RIGHT HERE
[5:38:02] <+pectusumbra> one of you just get to the damn store already
