[0:02:42] <Iwashi94> anyone else who watched streams feel like the whole stealth vs honor seems to be laid on way too thick imo
[0:02:45] <axelkaspar> General Souboutei once won two battles at once without even being present at either battle

[0:26:00] <%StaceMcGate> Whoa, I'm gone for 40 minutes and Woolie has a new outfit. Is that DLC?

[0:59:11] <+C0baltCrusade> Remember, the entire reason for Musashi's super long hairstyle without the top being shaved is because he had a gross pimple there as a kid and it left a scar, im dead serious
[0:59:15] <Shishi1205> thye would break
[0:59:19] <NotHereToStream> there is a cool modern bow called the instant legolas
[0:59:23] <%dinnydanny777> This guy voices Hojo btw
[0:59:30] <laguerrilha> yeah they would break
[0:59:38] <Prevot> oh shit it is hojo
[0:59:42] <+GenesisKnight> Legolas is an elf. He cheats.
[0:59:43] <ScatterCatt> Crossbow bolts are sturdier, so it would work better with one of those, but yes. Arrows can be stabbing implements.
[0:59:47] <BritishTyrannosaur> do we get the semi auto bow later?
[0:59:58] <jorniev> i think the flower is for coloring clothes
[1:00:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Gozen?
[1:00:12] <derap41> @BritishTyrannosaur Those are Chinese and like 200 years later
[1:00:17] <Byr0nX> bakana
[1:00:18] <laguerrilha> Elf wood could be magic so sure his dont break, but unless its metal rodsm then it would break irl
[1:00:20] <%MacabreOpus> Saw a home gym product online that was essentially a massive bow but with a resistance band. Truly we have become apex predators
[1:00:33] <BritishTyrannosaur> apex legends ayyyyy
[1:00:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE TOMOE GOZEN
[1:00:51] <lennyrager> Wait. THAT Tomoe?
[1:00:56] <%dinnydanny777> I think Mongolian archers were famous for the amount of arrows they could fire in a minute, so you might not need a semi auto bow
[1:01:02] <%MacabreOpus> It's called a Gorilla Bow if anybody wants a chuckle
[1:01:08] <BritishTyrannosaur> Heavy machine bow
[1:01:12] <Byr0nX> my neck
[1:01:18] <+C0baltCrusade> ow
[1:01:20] <%dinnydanny777> my back
[1:01:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they are talking about a tomoe who's a prodigy and goood with a bow so that's the only one that comes to mind
[1:01:35] <%mechslayer71> Get big and porky off that cheat armor woolie
[1:01:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Turns out bows are real useful
[1:01:51] <enZymeth> Swipe right on the touchpad after battle for style
[1:01:51] <derap41> A Mongolian archer could have 5 arrows in the air at the same time while shooting continuously
[1:01:53] <+CptBritches> "Did you see my moves, sensei!"
[1:01:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:01:55] <+xerotwo> TOSHIIIIIIII doodCrazy
[1:02:00] <%dinnydanny777> Bows are kind of interesting because no one alive today is as good as a bow as anyone who was good with a bow back in the day
[1:02:13] <yuribo26> This game doesn't even look that good, I'm watching in 160p and it looks like a last gen game Jebaited
[1:02:27] <%Josef_Stryker> Well it helps that they're kinda rendered obsolete nowadays thanks to guns and the crossbow
[1:02:28] <culturedpagan1> a mongol archer could pin a birds wings mid-flight.
[1:02:32] <jorniev> GROSS
[1:02:40] <laguerrilha> He sprints if you sprint
[1:02:42] <derap41> @dinnydanny777 Well your life doesn't really depend on it anymore so
[1:02:50] <%dinnydanny777> Longbowmen could supposedly fire further than anyone alive today because they had muscle deformities in their shoulders due to constant practice, meaning their shoulder muscles were actually deformed and stronger or something
[1:02:50] <+JingKaisean> @dinnydanny777 don't know if that's true, there are still competitive archers who train for those same skills
[1:03:03] <usotaku013666> So how long until you fight the famous Mongol Horse Archers?
[1:03:15] <+luftraumm1> competitive archery today is very different than ancient archery
[1:03:19] <sileo_patronus> I think you lose standoff the moment combat starts for real
[1:03:23] <laguerrilha> Oh yeah the mongol archers
[1:03:37] <+CptBritches> Mongolian horse archers are why they were such an empire
[1:03:38] <derap41> There is trick archery but they use very light bows and wide arrows
[1:03:39] <culturedpagan1> i like how 1/10th of these guys actually have bows.
[1:03:40] <BritishTyrannosaur> to be fair the ten rings used jericho missles after Obadia stane lended a few of tony starks so. no wonder the bow and arrow took the backseat
[1:03:40] <%MacabreOpus> @dinnydanny777 Understandable. Today it's recreational, then it was for survival.
[1:03:41] <jorniev> MOBILE ALTILLERY
[1:03:43] <Shishi1205> yeah
[1:03:54] <Shishi1205> Horseback Archery is fucking powerful
[1:04:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LIGHTNING OF TOMOE? PogChamp
[1:04:02] <+Double_Tap_That> Mongolian horse archers are basically drone strikes, right?
[1:04:04] <Prevot> monkaS
[1:04:08] <+pedrothecruel> they could hit a sparrow in flight
[1:04:08] <%toastybites> Mount and Blade PTSD flashbacks

[1:04:37] <Shishi1205> monhun tech
[1:04:37] <derap41> A Mongol Horse archer had 3-5 spare horses that they would change so they could keep up a fast paced attack
[1:04:40] <coldfire0007> Not enough games do that
[1:04:43] <laguerrilha> Why is he using a Colonel Sanders mask?

[1:05:30] <%mechslayer71> @mattmanj17 Have you watched woolie play literally any game ever
[1:05:37] <+JingKaisean> Mongols got really good when they conquered other nations and took their tech.
[1:05:40] <derap41> They still mostly won
[1:05:42] <+jpipeman> They got really good at sieges
[1:05:49] <DatAsuna> The only thing that gave them real troube was big walled cities.
[1:05:50] <+JingKaisean> With siege weapons, they were pretty much unstoppable.
[1:05:52] <+spinalwizard> Forgotten the face of your father?
[1:05:55] <mattmanj17> snail of tsushima
[1:05:55] <DatAsuna> And then after china they solved that too

[1:06:08] <+pedrothecruel> if you fight them anywhere you lose
[1:06:09] <memes_are_cancer> Oh no
[1:06:15] <culturedpagan1> didnt matter if you had big walls if you could never ever leave them.
[1:06:15] <%astrofalcon1> only half
[1:06:28] <+LokimenD> If the Mongols are so great how come they're all dead?
[1:06:36] <%MacabreOpus> @LokimenD Was that the Dark Tower
[1:06:41] <coldfire0007> When do you unlock the other half of the bow?
[1:06:41] <+LokimenD> yes
[1:06:46] <yuribo26> You cAAn
[1:06:49] <DatAsuna> Because they settled down and became the Yuan dynasty mostly
[1:06:53] <%MacabreOpus> that movie wasn't abysmal just horrendously boring

[1:07:46] <jorniev> YEEAAAAH
[1:07:46] <DatAsuna> The thing people kinda forget about China is that China hasn't actually been unified for it's whole history and there's 5 major ethnic groups all mixed in there including the mongols
[1:07:55] <Flare3500> Call of Duty Chernobyl sniper , remember the Coriolis effect
[1:07:56] <%astrofalcon1> just give me a gun

[1:20:04] <%MacabreOpus> Is that one dude still crawling, raw
[1:20:08] <derap41> You never sheath a sword after a battle you clean it thoroughlyfirst
[1:20:12] <JetpackMcQuack> help him
[1:20:22] <Flare3500> He was pretending to be dead so close
[1:20:23] <cosmicgoatee> press button to End Suffering
[1:20:29] <%Tuna_Can_0> But is your sheath rocket powered?
[1:20:30] <Run44forrest> Why not carry as many swords as you can. whats the downside
[1:20:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> stick around and find out
[1:20:47] <%arkv01> getting DMCA'd by shounen jump

[1:22:38] <Shishi1205> Are you sure about that
[1:22:39] <+freeizone> mongols no skills
[1:22:52] <Flare3500> Everytime you kill someone you have to shout "HONOR" , it's like UNO
[1:22:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's literally impossible Woolie.
[1:22:57] <jorniev> LIKE IN DRAGONS DOGMA
[1:22:58] <+pedrothecruel> what
[1:23:06] <jorniev> TENFOLD ARROW
[1:23:07] <derap41> Mongols could fire two arrows at the same time and hold up to eight arrows in the hand while shooting
[1:23:11] <Run44forrest> these arrows have no honor
[1:23:13] <%dinnydanny777> If a character has a bow and they can't rain arrows then what is the point
[1:23:20] <+LokimenD> Like Robin Hood Man in Thighs?
[1:23:27] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> mongotocracy
[1:23:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, I don't think Sensei is going to kill about murdering someone from behind considering he told you to pepper them with arrows in an amubsh.
[1:23:32] <Meltgar> Mongols said that if you had skills they "adopt" you by force, unless you wanna end up killed
[1:23:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kill about murdering
[1:23:42] <Iwashi94> man, Ishikawa is kinda racist huh

[1:30:08] <Flare3500> So we got Masako and Ishikawa , we just need a tank paladin to frontline
[1:30:11] <Goraka91> The Dishonourable Samurai Who Commited Sepekku of Tsushima

[1:30:51] <%arkv01> recruit daddy
[1:30:56] <ZE_Count> So is the game good?
[1:30:58] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The optimal way to play this game is with some Nujabes beatws
[1:31:02] <%astrofalcon1> recruit that guy with the glasses
[1:31:06] <derap41> Just realized he has the Sakai Crest on his helmet
[1:31:07] <%astrofalcon1> he's pretty cool

[1:31:11] <%arkv01> @ANGRA_MAlNYU I feel it
[1:31:25] <Goraka91> @ZE_Count Seems to be a very good open world game, if you like those
[1:31:29] <+freeizone> supposedly combat and setting is the main draws
[1:31:35] <ZE_Count> cool armor
[1:31:36] <BritishTyrannosaur> this game is bad because it's not exactly the same as sekiro apparently
[1:31:38] <VidulaSaix> DIGITAL DELUXE HORSE

[1:36:14] <%dinnydanny777> This music though
[1:36:16] <DatAsuna> the subtitle background helps a lot
[1:36:27] <DatAsuna> I prefer a dark grey over sheer black but either way
[1:36:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> My internet is giving me 160p.
[1:36:32] <derap41> The constant grass coming is really messing with the stream compression
[1:36:51] <laguerrilha> Check the main villain voice in english, its so strong
[1:36:57] <Prevot> english speakers go through life thinking people in other countries get redone lip sync for their languages
[1:36:57] <Sol_Install> So it's Square Tech
[1:36:58] <%arkv01> but I mean those kingdom hearts character models are basically playdoh
[1:37:22] <+Exicuren> Judgement also had multilanguaje lip syncing
[1:37:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, I had it manually on 160p for a shitty stream. Auto kicks it up to 1080 just fine. I'm a dumbass.

[1:40:56] <laguerrilha> They werent blunt, but mostly they were more to stab and mace armor
[1:40:59] <+JingKaisean> also, spears
[1:41:05] <Shwepie> Swords were not 30 lbs of metal.
[1:41:06] <Hyphixsys> @Flare3500 Kappa
[1:41:07] <derap41> Late medieval swords were used more as crowbars than swords
[1:41:07] <+JingKaisean> spears are 1000x better than swords
[1:41:13] <%Javaa01> Well, european swords could take clashing, but not japanese katanas, since their metal is too soft and shitty
[1:41:17] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Swords are sidearms

[1:43:18] <dukenux> Arrival was great
[1:43:25] <derap41> Then they dumb it down for the general audience
[1:43:26] <DatAsuna> Ad Astra is just another shitty "I went to space to find god" movie
[1:43:27] <Pnutz409> my brother did that to me on Gravity... he's like there would never be a flammable was source on this craft in space
[1:43:32] <%memequisition> the sapir-worf hypothesis has been discredited a great deal
[1:43:35] <+JingKaisean> arrival was cool because they had weird octopus sea creatures as aliens
[1:43:35] <laguerrilha> Its fiction, as much as it tries to appear real its not real. so no need to be logical
[1:43:37] <%arkv01> yes I have arrived
[1:43:38] <+Exicuren> Master and Commander, amazing movie
[1:43:42] <%memequisition> i love it tho it's fun
[1:43:57] <VidulaSaix> DUNE
[1:43:58] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:43:58] <+froduck42> DUNE
[1:43:58] <+JingKaisean> Dune dog
[1:43:59] <Shishi1205> DUNE
[1:43:59] <DesertPenguin> What about Contact? Did they have language stuff?
[1:44:00] <dukenux> DOON
[1:44:03] <%jiggy_snipe> dune
[1:44:04] <derap41> Bobiverse does a pretty good job following physics except for FTL communication
[1:44:04] <%jepupu> Arrival had some wild China pandering
[1:44:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> ENUNCIATE
[1:44:05] <%arkv01> D O O G
[1:44:06] <+OmegaWeltall> yea they are making a new DUNE movie LUL
[1:44:07] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[1:44:11] <%doomerskeletor13> D U N E
[1:44:18] <Kei_Ar_> DOON
[1:44:23] <%Livelinne> woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT
[1:44:27] <Kei_Ar_> Dune:Eternal
[1:44:30] <sumo_cheesey_boi_san> F for jodorowsky's dune
[1:44:30] <MutedMimic> LUL
[1:44:33] <%MacabreOpus> The Wire has the same intense focus towards integrity and believability
[1:44:33] <derap41> D U N E is space Opera nonsense tho
[1:44:33] <%arkv01> dune 2016, good shit
[1:44:41] <%DomunDomunDomun> Another doom movie already came out. Apparently it's BAD.
[1:44:43] <%Livelinne> dweun??
[1:44:48] <allmightythunder> @dukenux this is the quote: “Neil deGrasse Tyson sent me quite a snarky e-mail saying that, at that time of year, in that position in the Atlantic in 1912, when Rose (Kate Winslet) is lying on the piece of driftwood and staring up at the stars, that is not the star field she would have seen,” Cameron told to Discovery.
[1:44:53] <DesertPenguin> lul
[1:45:00] <allmightythunder> so it was the starfield as a whole
[1:45:02] <AThing_> The mini series is also pretty old at this point
[1:45:04] <dukenux> Interstellar has a really accurate model of a black hole apparently
[1:45:05] <DesertPenguin> I heard Dune
[1:45:08] <bahble> it's going to be 2 movies
[1:45:12] <bahble> the villeneuve ones
[1:45:12] <Hyphixsys> kinda like how the messed up Dark Tower LUL
[1:45:12] <derap41> Dune is stupid big
[1:45:26] <AThing_> It's large and dense
[1:45:26] <%arkv01> @dukenux LUL yeah I'm in the dunk degrasse in a vat of pee camp now
[1:45:30] <%jepupu> Dune’s MC is a massive Gary Stu in the books already
[1:45:31] <+OmegaWeltall> yea Dune is huge, i love it though
[1:45:37] <DatAsuna> what
[1:45:43] <+JingKaisean> ZOE2 as a movie, would it work?
[1:45:48] <+OmegaWeltall> yea pause LUL
[1:45:48] <%MacabreOpus> Interstellar gets praised for its black hole procedural calculations yet the other 99% of the film is complete baloney
[1:45:58] <%Javaa01> It's the same mold
[1:46:08] <+freeizone> RE4's Legacy
[1:46:09] <%arkv01> @macabre the time travel and dimensional bullshit was pure anime
[1:46:11] <+JingKaisean> Interstellar is clearly bullshit, but it's fuckin weird
[1:46:14] <+JingKaisean> so cool
[1:46:18] <derap41> @MacabreOpus which were even really necessary
[1:46:24] <Shishi1205> Music is good too
[1:46:28] <+OmegaWeltall> yea that black hole render simulation took like 100's of hours
[1:46:35] <derap41> Deep Down Remember?
[1:46:47] <available_line> Did Woolie play Horizon Zero Dawn?
[1:46:48] <%MacabreOpus> To give the movie some credit, I've seen two movies since the release of Interstellar that have the exact same black hole design
[1:47:22] <Flare3500> To do list
[1:47:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:25] <%MacabreOpus> Hype Vote: Tenet or Dune?
[1:47:31] <+JingKaisean> Inception is almost entirely hypothetical, but I'll allow it
[1:47:37] <%MacabreOpus> I'm going with Dune, personally
[1:47:41] <dukenux> AC doesnt do AC towers anymore apparently
[1:47:49] <%Javaa01> They're not towers, but they have the same function of filling out the map with question marks
[1:47:50] <+freeizone> open world games and hidden loading
[1:47:52] <+JingKaisean> Tenet - he's got jojo part 4 powers
[1:48:01] <+Exicuren> I hate the fucking AC towers so much
[1:48:07] <derap41> Wither 3 in Japan
[1:48:10] <%allups> Ac does have AC towers atleasy since the last one
[1:48:11] <dukenux> For a movie about dreamscape Inception wasnt weird enough
[1:48:21] <%MacabreOpus> Assassin's Creed deserves another movie
[1:48:22] <+Exicuren> One of the main things I didn't like in the Spiderman OS4 game
[1:48:23] <Prevot> oh shit DSP got banned PogChamp
[1:48:29] <Hyphixsys> @Prevot OOF
[1:48:36] <AThing_> he wasn't banned?
[1:48:38] <laguerrilha> It was Witcher 3 for me
[1:48:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> witcher 3 kinda has that too
[1:48:51] <%MacabreOpus> Can't believe Ubisoft had the balls to put an AC tower in the AC film. The FILM.
[1:49:02] <Flare3500> I mean Skyrim ,Throat of the world was pretty cool
[1:49:16] <derap41> Oblivion was probably my first
[1:49:21] <Shardlab> The real world is often that
[1:49:22] <dukenux> @jingkaisean Nolan is as obsessed with weird time perception bullshit as Araki, tbf
[1:49:30] <laguerrilha> Yeah Skyrim was pretty for the time and every direction had something. even if after 20h it was mostly the same
[1:49:32] <%Tuna_Can_0> What you don't like Last of Uncharted, The Horizon Zero God of Days Gone?
[1:49:34] <+JingKaisean> I respect that
[1:49:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lol DSP banned from Twitch
[1:49:36] <DatAsuna> AssCreed is also often not accurate, especially AC Odyssey's greece
[1:49:39] <Prevot> problem with BotW was you fight the same 5 enemies over and over
[1:49:43] <+freeizone> souls is kinda built that way too since you get views from higher up
[1:49:46] <BlackermanZX> i miss AC2
[1:49:55] <%allups> in fact that's how they remade it IRL after the fire
[1:49:58] <%MacabreOpus> Parts of Paris have been meticulously built by Ubisoft to the point they've used the data to rebuilt the damages to the Notre Dame supposedly
[1:50:02] <%BisoromiBear> DSP will revive Mixer
[1:50:12] <%astrofalcon1> oh yeah dsp was banned again
