[1:10:12] <LeeOhX> This is making me sad, stop this

[1:10:18] <EyeFarted> FETUS GOT DELETED
[1:10:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we killed the frog, people
[1:10:22] <Rionxgarland> that is obscure
[1:10:23] <DLUCKIEST> Fetus deletus.

[1:10:31] <UnknownGerm> TBH loss has never been that funny to me.
[1:10:31] <voyagerwitch> this is the first stream ive ever seen of someone being taught about memes in real time
[1:10:31] <EASrake> "hilarious:
[1:10:31] <zepelinnn> YEETUS THE FETUS
[1:10:32] <gunsrlove> It must've been relevant 12 years ago
[1:10:38] <AggsMK7> Memesplaining
[1:10:43] <+boosh5> No one gets it. They just reference it.
[1:10:44] <gustavozxd> Woolie is not explaining this very well
[1:10:45] <sosuke5> The fetus was no longer funky
[1:10:45] <vriskybusiness8> "it's hilaarious, usually"
[1:10:46] <gruib> Ctrl Alt Del pregnancy
[1:10:55] <vriskybusiness8> are you sure about that?
[1:10:55] <DLUCKIEST> @AggsMK7 I wanna push the term "memesplaining" now.
[1:10:56] <%cervidaequus> today on behind the meme: woolie vs normie gf
[1:10:57] <$RilsRislan> It's not hilarious when you point it out and explain it
[1:11:00] <%GohanEgret> this needs a pat level explanation
[1:11:09] <Laironx3> "gotcha"
[1:11:09] <+WhyIDie> it's breaking down a heavy and complicated topic into the simplest of terms, comedically trivializing the topic
[1:11:13] <alastorkunn> let me explain it: the girl gets vergiled
[1:11:19] <AggsMK7> You probably shouldn't
[1:11:26] <BioStormX> Just send her to the "Know Your Meme" page
[1:11:27] <%Doodle_Taco> Darn, I need to go. See you later guys!!
[1:11:29] <worldbrand> people made fun of it because it was tone deaf
[1:11:30] <$RilsRislan> "This guy made a long running series of webcomic of shitty toilet humour in 4 panels, and suddenly decided that having a miscarriage was a good idea of his toilet humour webcomic"

[2:05:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> hung like a dwarf
[2:05:32] <+SpartanDumpster> I wanna see what's happening! Just end AD! BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:05:35] <worldbrand> But you didn't get far enough with Liam anyway
[2:05:36] <JordanDel95> nah he meant if you chose the other thing with tg, you could swap
[2:05:37] <MyNameIsRasus> And also choosing bad choices for dialogue
[2:05:38] <Laironx3> no i regret it
[2:05:43] <+CJett92> Not on that day. It was Liam only that day
[2:05:52] <DLUCKIEST> "Didn't you hang out with me?"
[2:05:59] <+StromkoPenguin> I think those two hangouts happened on different days as well. Liam was the most recent.
[2:06:01] <@akuda_bar> that was the saying you like somebody
[2:06:12] <@akuda_bar> you could've pulled it off in the end if you hadn't done that
[2:06:13] <CptBritches> Oh no Woolie can't remember who hung out with him. He's getting dementia

[2:06:38] <AggsMK7> Yeah but this is funnier
[2:06:49] <DLUCKIEST> This is the best fucking possible outcome.
[2:06:50] <alloftheworld_1> It's more fitting for the stream, yeah
[2:06:52] <UrsulaCat> it's a choose your own adventure
[2:07:08] <AggsMK7> She hung out with Liam tho
[2:07:10] <Jashter18> So when is the SBF fan fighting game that is Evo ready?
[2:07:10] <ekkieekk> no you hung out with woolie the day before
[2:07:11] <JordanDel95> the "somebody" was the person you did extra curriculars with specifically I assume
[2:07:11] <voyagerwitch> that was on a different day
[2:07:12] <AggsMK7> It was that day
[2:07:13] <%Eaglestrike117> no but you said you liked liam
[2:07:13] <@akuda_bar> no the line was "There was someone i hung out with TODAY"
[2:07:14] <GohanEgret> you hung out with liam at home ec
[2:07:17] <+StromkoPenguin> @WoolieVersus The hangouts happened on different days, Liam was that day
[2:07:18] <+CJett92> But she only hung out with Liam on that day!
[2:07:19] <+fr0zach> keyword is TODAY
[2:07:19] <ekkieekk> you hung out with liam the day in question
[2:07:19] <alrobot2014> this was immediately after the home ec room
[2:07:21] <roseshrimp> yeah someone i hung out with TODAY
[2:07:21] <NyxFang> Different days
[2:07:22] <%Eaglestrike117> cause you hung out WITH LIAM THAT DAY
[2:07:23] <gunstar73> You hung with Liam that day
[2:07:24] <%SeriousMrBlack> that's how it is on this bitch of an earth tbh
[2:07:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie, she hung out with Woolie, then Liam, them you confirmed Liam.
[2:07:29] <+WhyIDie> if only the engine could detect if you rotated your saves, make that a requirement for the pat route
[2:07:30] <+Mvrdok_> @woolieversus It was Liam that day
[2:07:31] <%HossMosh> She botched it though with Woolie right?
[2:07:34] <MelBrooksKA> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[2:07:47] <DLUCKIEST> I am ecstatic after that ending.
[2:07:58] <MyNameIsRasus> She also chose bad options during hangouts so that's why she didn't get Liam either
[2:08:08] <DLUCKIEST> That's true, she Warren'd Liam.
[2:08:12] <+bigb00gi3> this needs a detroit-style explosion of branching paths, clearly

[2:17:36] <AggsMK7> I straight up don't understand the Idaho one. Is it because potatoes?
[2:17:37] <WG101> why does kirito use the best weapon in the game as his offhand?
[2:17:38] <%CEGold> Where's my RECARDLESS shirt cmonBruh

[2:18:25] <@akuda_bar> @SeriousMrBlack LUL
[2:18:26] <WG101> @alrobot2014 i doubt the game is that sophisticated
[2:18:28] <alloftheworld_1> Just because someone is from Idaho, doesn't mean they'll show mercy in Idaho.
[2:18:28] <%HossMosh> @seriousmrblack hahahahahah!
[2:18:32] <+RevolverOcelot16> So can I buy these shirts or they just concepts?

[2:21:33] <%HossMosh> Holy shit it does say recardless!
[2:21:34] <alloftheworld_1> I know about Idaho, I just don't pay attention to them
[2:21:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> dumping the bucket
[2:21:47] <+StromkoPenguin> He's piggybacking her all the way to the store in -30 weather because energy drinks
[2:21:51] <dukenux> Those majin ones are the worst
[2:21:53] <DLUCKIEST> "I have two sides. Nicest guy you've ever seen and TWISTED FUCKING PSYCHOPATH"
[2:22:04] <%SeriousMrBlack> the coffee is being heated as we speak
[2:22:17] <DLUCKIEST> And there's a huge punch penis too.
[2:22:17] <%Psycosis> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:22:19] <voyagerwitch> he has to count each individual bean give him a break
[2:22:26] <+StromkoPenguin> All of these shirts need the subtitle (I'm Autistic)
[2:22:35] <+WhyIDie> cringing so hard at these shirts that my internal organs are getting wrinkles
[2:22:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> the coffee has to get erect first
[2:22:37] <DLUCKIEST> I want one of Infinite from Sonic Forces.
[2:22:41] <MyNameIsRasus> The Goku Blue one sounds like something out of an edgy manga
[2:22:42] <WG101> @DLUCKIEST elaborate on "punch penis"
[2:22:47] <voyagerwitch> hey, what? don't use autism as an insult
[2:22:51] <+lotsofsausage> @StromkoPenguin bonus points if they're weighted
[2:22:57] <DLUCKIEST> @WG101 It's not my place to elaborate on it.
[2:23:08] <alrobot2014> woolie is obviously picking the bean out of his front yard
[2:23:13] <+StromkoPenguin> It's only funny because the person in the t-shirt is self-diagnosed and just awkward.
[2:23:18] <%ChoculaUltra> the recardless one has a special place in my heart.
[2:23:31] <%SeriousMrBlack> ahhh now that's a shirt, they don't make em like they used to..
[2:23:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> smacking the python
[2:23:37] <+Shady_Zaku> When did he start streaming today, if at all yet?
[2:23:40] <DLUCKIEST> I might live in Idaho, but can I see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
[2:23:41] <%Psycosis> These are shirts Rick and Morty fans would wear
[2:23:45] <%HossMosh> I always like the weirdly specific ones that are like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mess with a Supernatural fan who is from South Dakota and born in May.‚Äù
[2:23:46] <+RevolverOcelot16> These shirts just need to be sent to me. I will wear them everyday , if possible
[2:23:47] <voyagerwitch> either way, it's not a good look. it makes actual autistic folk here feel like theyre not welcome.

[2:47:32] <SephirKath> Dump her corpse in a river, no one will miss her.
[2:47:32] <gustavozxd> "that was mean" - KillBoss
[2:47:33] <alrobot2014> something about shit eating grins just makes me happy
[2:47:34] <nobody12349> Kanoko? More like Kanogo fuck yourself
[2:47:39] <HeavyC4> ^
[2:47:41] <Parapattern> Woolie has assumes the "character hate" posture
[2:47:43] <+StromkoPenguin> "Heheh, you're stuck with me, the total useless load!" octoSmug
[2:47:43] <gorillahandz> he looks so dead
[2:47:43] <cumurasame> everyone except asaru is smugness embodied
[2:47:44] <$megamonmon123> maybe she is the final boss
[2:47:44] <didgereedoodah> I feel like she's gonna be a boss later
[2:47:47] <TungstenViper> This the kind of shit that makes me stop playing a game alltogether,,,
[2:47:48] <JigsK> this is making me feel feelings of uselessness ive fe;t before
[2:47:48] <DLUCKIEST> Just wait for the time skip to happen and Kotaru to be dead.
[2:47:49] <%thatonestraightman> MISSION SARTU
[2:47:51] <gorillahandz> POSES

[2:47:56] <kaine_west> yo Oribe is cool
[2:47:57] <+Alexplosion35> KOWASHITAI
[2:47:58] <GohanEgret> Oribe did nothing wrong
[2:47:58] <AggsMK7> Word
[2:47:58] <%ChoculaUltra> but the hand gestures!
[2:47:59] <Rezca> Sounds like an employee who will take all the credit if we succeed
[2:48:00] <+Someone_Kooky> he looks dead inside
[2:48:01] <buster7800> please let her be a boss
[2:48:01] <%ChoculaUltra> the smug!

[2:48:05] <%Doodle_Taco> WHY IA SHE SO SMUG DAMMIT
[2:48:06] <+PenmanLupine> she's throwing up gangsigns
[2:48:06] <alrobot2014> but oribe wasn't an asshole
[2:48:07] <+Arkfyre> KOWASHITAI
[2:48:08] <%SeriousMrBlack> that walk though
[2:48:12] <dukenux> Gangs Are No Good
[2:48:12] <Parapattern> I HATE her SO MUCH
[2:48:14] <%Adriangabs> She looks like one of those characters that will die first in a Jap horror game
[2:48:14] <gorillahandz> She'd be the best girl in a danganronpa
[2:48:16] <TungstenViper> SHE NEEDS TO DIE
[2:48:16] <krymzen5> or she would make it out
[2:48:17] <gustavozxd> she totally wouldn't actually
[2:48:19] <DLUCKIEST> PUT YOUR GUN AWAY
[2:48:19] <WG101> no, she'd live for a few chapters
[2:48:19] <gorillahandz> fuck that loser
[2:48:20] <AggsMK7> Devil May SPY
[2:48:22] <DLUCKIEST> NO FACE
[2:48:25] <Th3rd3> faceless NPC
[2:48:25] <SephirKath> Mutants!
[2:48:26] <GohanEgret> MrDestructoid
[2:48:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Faceless Waifus
[2:48:27] <%Doodle_Taco> NO SHE WOULD BE A SURVIVOR BECAUSE SHE SUCKS
[2:48:28] <dukenux> NO FACE WutFace
[2:48:29] <nobody12349> WHERE ARE THEIR EYES?
[2:48:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Oh god they have no faces
[2:48:30] <+StromkoPenguin> Yeah she's comic relief whatever's happening would kill her first.
[2:48:30] <%king_wragles> THEY DON'T HAVE EYES
[2:48:33] <valanway_slash> thats more advanced than Persona 5's faceless crowd!
[2:48:34] <Th3rd3> so Anime!!
[2:48:35] <JigsK> its fine
[2:48:35] <gunstar73> She would die late into the game
[2:48:36] <+toothpick2600> NPCs with no face is actually kinda creepy
[2:48:37] <WG101> @Doodle_Taco exactly
[2:48:39] <JigsK> lots of ppl dont have eyes
[2:48:40] <dukenux> What's wrong with her faaaaaaaace
[2:48:41] <DynamicMenace_> no face bois
[2:48:43] <gustavozxd> she would die maybe on the third or fourth chapter, think about it
[2:48:44] <JigsK> no need to brign it up
[2:48:44] <gunstar73> She‚Äôs to much of a shit
[2:48:47] <Parapattern> They're just going out onto the street shooting people at random
[2:48:47] <dukenux> God, i hope so
[2:48:49] <+VariantX7> which ones are the souless machines again..cant tell
[2:48:53] <odd_slater> It's definitely budget but still stylized
[2:48:56] <Prevot> office lady is the best look
[2:48:58] <OkamiDude15> @dukenux doodBro
[2:48:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Probably, if not Sailor Uniforms
[2:48:59] <fuji_92> nah, she'd be the "main" villain in a danganronpa
[2:49:00] <krymzen5> yes actually
[2:49:05] <CptBritches> They do in JAV
[2:49:06] <%Adriangabs> SHE'S TOO PINK I CANNOT HANDLE
[2:49:13] <DLUCKIEST> Gotta do some spy work on that vagina.
[2:49:13] <$megamonmon123> @prevot i prefer the soapland outfit
[2:49:13] <KillMyPast> This game is super budget
[2:49:13] <CptBritches> SO SMUG
[2:49:14] <voyagerwitch> oh shit what if kanoko is the main villain in this too
[2:49:15] <DynamicMenace_> SMUG
[2:49:15] <gorillahandz> you think?
[2:49:15] <dukenux> "Little"
[2:49:16] <nobody12349> She would
[2:49:17] <reonome> ya think
[2:49:18] <zepelinnn> a little?
[2:49:18] <HeavyC4> Asaru is a good guy. FUCK THE BOSS
[2:49:23] <kaine_west> she's an asshole love it
[2:49:24] <ayy_lma_o> this game doesn't seem too low budget actually
[2:49:24] <krymzen5> it looks like a passion project
[2:49:26] <gustavozxd> Dr villains don't go crazy until the very end though
[2:49:26] <GohanEgret> in fairness, that's a lot of VO
[2:49:28] <%Menitta> The faceless NPCs didnt show that already
[2:49:30] <gorillahandz> FUCKIN TRAFFIC CONES
[2:49:31] <+dopeboy_i> look like a hoodie to me
[2:49:33] <dukenux> Traffic Cones LUL
[2:49:37] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> no mouths on the models
[2:49:44] <gunstar73> I‚Äôm pretty sure this game is still early access technically
[2:49:47] <gorillahandz> It's got the style where it's most needed, and thats good
[2:49:49] <+Thorn14> Is this Nier Automata
[2:49:57] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Looks much better than Jump Force tho
[2:49:58] <+JackMillerTime> skynet went weirder than i thought
[2:49:59] <KillMyPast> Youd prob like playing Amelia more
[2:50:00] <+hypethefool> it was made by one guy
[2:50:00] <voyagerwitch> @gustavozxd dr1 would like to have a word with you
[2:50:01] <DLUCKIEST> NEW MOVE
[2:50:05] <+VariantX7> automatic points for suplexes
[2:50:05] <Parapattern> This outside area looks budget as Hell
[2:50:09] <gorillahandz> It DOES look better than jump force
[2:50:13] <HeavyC4> he Dante + NERO
[2:50:16] <%MONSTR_UwU> woolieS woolieT
[2:50:19] <DatAsuna> It expands significantly
[2:50:19] <HeavyC4> he got BLUE ROSE CHARGED ATTACKS
[2:50:20] <%MONSTR_UwU> woolieF woolieU
[2:50:21] <Th3rd3> this is impressive for a budget title
[2:50:22] <+Thorn14> PREMIUM
[2:50:23] <%Menitta> Nice try
[2:50:24] <Prevot> anything looks better than jump force
[2:50:24] <+Someone_Kooky> is she NOT a spy?
[2:50:25] <%ChoculaUltra> don't forget there's a whole other character too
[2:50:26] <gustavozxd> @voyagerwitch main villain isn't show until the very end of the game tho LUL
[2:50:30] <opethrockr55> Yeah, you'll get some new options shortly
[2:50:30] <krymzen5> i feel like i could put a few hours into it fs
[2:50:34] <voyagerwitch> no, she's "shown"
[2:50:34] <+StromkoPenguin> Is this what they do with old smart phones? Send them to die against corporate spies?
[2:50:36] <GohanEgret> m o b o r o b o
[2:50:40] <+SuichiTanaka> Visual clarity is at an all time low though
[2:50:45] <TimetodiveLTX> the punch girl is playable and supposed to be a lot more fun to play, but that's just hear say
[2:50:52] <SolD1ng0> this game is based off a visual novel
[2:50:52] <%MONSTR_UwU> woolieVERGIN woolieVS woolieTRASH
[2:50:54] <dukenux> Yeah, atleast it seems to put its scarce budget into right places
[2:50:56] <+Someone_Kooky> look at it‚Äôs face!
[2:50:58] <Parapattern> We need MORE shit on the screen
[2:51:03] <faegbeard> PREMIUM!
[2:51:04] <%thatonestraightman> "Intruder alert! A blue spy is in the base!"
[2:51:05] <voyagerwitch> @SkitzoGamer of course it is
[2:51:07] <Orenjevel> wow devil may cry sure is a lot more anime than i remember
[2:51:11] <gorillahandz> I love the big CLEAR and ENEMY APPROACHING splash screens
[2:51:16] <krymzen5> yeah i have to agree. the effects are nice, but they are kinda making it hard to see
[2:51:16] <+ameer000> hopefully the briefcase can work like pandora
[2:51:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> A??? Baby Mode Kappa
[2:51:18] <SolD1ng0> and actually the guy seemed like he went from making visual novels to this
[2:51:23] <$megamonmon123> @zafooru this is less anime than dmc and you know it
[2:51:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you'll get new moves in like 2 rooms from now
[2:51:28] <%ChoculaUltra> I kinda like that better.
[2:51:31] <dukenux> Niiiiice credit cards Asaru. Is that eggshell?
[2:51:34] <Polengoldur> assault spy? is this some danganronpa rip off?
[2:51:36] <alrobot2014> its good for blind people
[2:51:41] <Archmortal> I got here literally 2 minutes ago and I can instantly see the ways it's stiff
[2:51:44] <GohanEgret> it's like closed captioning
[2:51:45] <WG101> redacted text?
[2:51:45] <SolD1ng0> (also this is a one man job)
[2:51:54] <gorillahandz> This game is budget, but they know how to keep it stylish
[2:51:55] <cumurasame> dangan may cry
[2:51:56] <nobody12349> The ko in Kanoko stands for koward.
[2:51:57] <+Thorn14> I like the art
[2:51:58] <krymzen5> sugui
[2:51:59] <+LogothX> is this spy fiction
[2:52:01] <gorillahandz> LOOK at this ANIME
[2:52:02] <odd_slater> I wanna know who does the art
[2:52:03] <SolD1ng0> (best game ever)
[2:52:06] <%Doodle_Taco> Senpai=Coach
[2:52:09] <+toothpick2600> Blue protag kinda reminds me of Persona 3
[2:52:13] <alrobot2014> the art looks familiar
[2:52:18] <HeavyC4> THESE ARE ROOKIE NUMBERS. PUMP THOSE NUMBERS UP! SwittRage
[2:52:20] <gunstar73> Yeah whoever did the art is pretty good
[2:52:23] <%ChoculaUltra> the life of a spy isn't an easy one.
[2:52:26] <alloftheworld_1> So the protag is basically Gill from the Simpsons LUL
[2:52:26] <CuttleCrow> he's a working man
[2:52:28] <%Adriangabs> he's a salaryman alight
[2:52:29] <krymzen5> n-no
[2:52:30] <GohanEgret> is that montreal Kappa
[2:52:30] <dukenux> it absolutely is
[2:52:33] <DatAsuna> But not of a dog
[2:52:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> jpg Japan
[2:52:35] <Orenjevel> using jpgs is the new hotness
[2:52:35] <Parapattern> This is definitely bargain barrel Dang ol Grandpa
[2:52:35] <+egalitarian696969> japan.jpg
[2:52:36] <DatAsuna> MR SHOWTIME
[2:52:37] <gorillahandz> BabyRage
[2:52:38] <voyagerwitch> asaru is like 30something right
[2:52:41] <+Someone_Kooky> and she‚Äôs got a perfect unblemished face
[2:52:45] <AggsMK7> One of these things is not like the others
[2:52:45] <$megamonmon123> 2019 the year if the JPEG
[2:52:46] <0rond> wait was that a dog or montreal?
[2:52:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Japan PNG
[2:52:48] <JigsK> people are crying and shes dancing in place
[2:52:50] <alrobot2014> first jpg dog then jpg japan
[2:52:50] <+ryosuke91kc> is that makoto from persona 3?
[2:52:52] <JigsK> dancing
[2:52:55] <%thatonestraightman> I bet this game will have a punch girl
[2:52:56] <krymzen5> i don't mind. i like the chars so far

[3:09:20] <%Nobrev> you didnt get the ground one
[3:09:23] <+sodashaq> Can he use his tie like a whip?
[3:09:29] <KnivesEve> just came back and must ask: what is the game and why am i digging the suitcase action man

[3:09:42] <WG101> @KnivesEve Assault Spy
[3:09:43] <krymzen5> look at that shoryu
[3:09:45] <alloftheworld_1> Hoping other moves have names like "Hostile Takeover" and "M&A: MURDER and Acquisition"
[3:09:48] <nobody12349> When are the two businessmen going to fight shirtless in the rain?
[3:09:50] <+Thorn14> you got air version
[3:09:56] <the7thdraconian> I do love the idea of a character action game starring spies
[3:10:00] <%thatonestraightman> Hey Woolie, im thinking of getting into street fighter. Is street fighter V arcade edition worth buying?
[3:10:05] <+sodashaq> Reminds me of those videos in Japan where a dude would make a bunch of fighting moves while in a business suit
[3:10:08] <gorillahandz> I hope this dude gets other weapons. What would be a Beowulf equivalent?
[3:10:15] <gustavozxd> only problem that i see right now are the animations, they look very low budget sadly
[3:10:18] <%Adriangabs> I hope those pips in the meter below are called "Stocks"
[3:10:18] <krymzen5> plus you know there's more
[3:10:18] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus word of warning that divekick is more like a dashing drop kick
[3:10:22] <Jashter18> Those tits just destroy the sub boxes lol
[3:10:27] <+cvp5127> @gorillahandz the punch girl
[3:10:28] <+sodashaq> Is that the punchgirl?

[3:10:41] <AggsMK7> KILL CASSHERN

[3:24:11] <gorillahandz> again, all for DmC combat with way better aesthetics and characters
[3:24:12] <nobody12349> Can you level Kanoko out of being garbo?
[3:24:19] <kaine_west> LB
[3:24:22] <alloftheworld_1> I think those were just makunouchi bentos
[3:24:23] <bagheadlive> you say DmC but it's actually Bayo influence because that's where DmC got a lot of it's ideas
[3:24:24] <%Nobrev> ü¶Ä WOOLIE WILL NEVER LEVEL KANOKO ü¶Ä
[3:24:25] <gruib> @thatonestraightman I started (and really kind of stayed) with skull girls. Aesthetics might not be for you but it was simple to learn for me. Tutorials helped me unlike any other fighter I tried. Or Dragon Ball FighterZ. Just an opinion.
[3:24:27] <gorillahandz> SHE IS SUB WEAPON
[3:24:28] <Archmortal> her button is on-screen by your health

[3:40:00] <+phatmac16> Luvia is pretty good too
[3:40:11] <+sodashaq> Someone who's good at business tell me if this game is accurate to real life
[3:40:23] <%IMDRanged> Hit box
[3:40:26] <+Thorn14> 100%
[3:40:27] <kaine_west> Tekken degens know about Lili's thigh game
[3:40:34] <%ChoculaUltra> Divine Beast : Vah Roomba
[3:40:35] <+Someone_Kooky> has the persona segment fallout spread to this stream? or is it all gonna come out next castle superbeast?
[3:40:37] <opethrockr55> Upgrade stations are everywhere, anyway
[3:40:39] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> This seems like an accurate portrayal of a typical office work day
[3:40:42] <Vlesh> I have a friend that works in an office 9 to 5, he just told me that this is what his normal day is like
[3:40:45] <SolD1ng0> its not, but its a good way to chill out after a poopy day in a cube
[3:40:54] <alloftheworld_1> I dunno, you passed by the first one already Keepo
[3:40:59] <gorillahandz> yeah its the boobs
[3:41:00] <CptBritches> Just wait until the open world Woolie

[3:41:08] <+kewlmyc> Fucking called it, Woolie
[3:41:08] <AggsMK7> O P P A I
[3:41:14] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Another warning, the only two moves that really get in eahc others way are the prop shedder and JUST launcher. Don't have both on at once. Anything else, go nuts.
[3:41:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> She knows
[3:41:17] <gorillahandz> after images so clean
[3:41:19] <xeros720> that blur effect is pretty slick

[3:41:52] <SolD1ng0> titties are the only reaon I wake up for work
[3:41:54] <+sodashaq> Perfectly calibrated bosoms
[3:41:56] <DatAsuna> Basically just launcher is meant to be a hold while shredder is tap, but it's a REALLY short window for hold
[3:41:59] <gorillahandz> chest so big they got their own gravitational pull
[3:42:02] <dukenux> Oppai so big it occupy entire FOV
[3:42:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Best Girl telling you its okay to stare at yabbos, what better girl can compete?

[3:42:05] <%Adriangabs> Tiddies so big it generates a gravitational pull on your eyes
[3:42:08] <DatAsuna> So you'll accidentally launch while meaning to shred often

[4:17:29] <SubjectX07x> Another interesting game that has seemingly gone rather under the radar coming soon is The Hong Kong Massacre. @WoolieVersus Think Hotline Miami meets John Woo.
[4:17:30] <OkamiDude15> guess nobody uploaded it to the site
[4:17:33] <krymzen5> dudes upload on hltb on day 1
[4:17:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No one has Submitted the HLTP
[4:17:37] <xeros720> they might've just left off the ending until it got out of early access
[4:17:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie gonna be the World Record
[4:17:37] <Graywolf_the_45th> Must be a long ass game
[4:17:37] <+Toa697> this game has 100 steam revies total
[4:17:39] <Cthulos> Isn't it early access.
[4:17:44] <+Toa697> which isnt much
[4:17:46] <CptBritches> It has the hardest final boss in video game history. No one can beat it
[4:17:47] <fuji_92> "oh shit you can see me in the reflection"
[4:17:51] <+cvp5127> time to look up timestop javs
[4:17:53] <%DedlokPM> @Cthulos Not anymore.
