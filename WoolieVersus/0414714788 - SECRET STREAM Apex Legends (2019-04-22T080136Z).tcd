[1:10:07] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Spoilers on YouTube are disgusting
[1:10:12] <%HDmexiqtioner> II I_
[1:10:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> The worst spoilers are the ones posted by guys on youtube who got the game early
[1:10:22] <ArbyW> YouTube thumbnails are the worst.
[1:10:26] <%khalcipher> yeah
[1:10:38] <$Bruh_itsTC> thumbnails an game defining spoiler as the title
[1:10:42] <+fatal_penguin_> Chaustic and his fart gas
[1:10:42] <bobbydrill> i had the final boss in my youtube recommended 2 days before the game came out
[1:10:45] <ArbyW> i indulged myself in big spoils cause I'm desperate but those guys are scummy.
[1:10:48] <$Bruh_itsTC> eff those people
[1:10:54] <+krispen_wa> Boss Fight Database being the greatest bro and spoiling literally every boss fight in the title and thumbnail
[1:10:56] <%Toynota10> and they put the fucking name of spoiler boss I. the video title too...
[1:11:00] <%khalcipher> youtube would have spoiled the final fight if i did not beat the game in 1 day
[1:11:01] <%ShockzNDrawe> @bobbydrill same
[1:11:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Top 10 Holy SH!t moments in DMCV- Buzzfeed
[1:11:29] <+fatal_penguin_> I was on part 11 of woolz dmc5 video and a recommended video was a SUPER spoiler. like FUCK
[1:11:29] <$Bruh_itsTC> i wish there was a mute keyword from appearing feature
[1:11:35] <tubbybaker> Dude you suck
[1:11:38] <%Toynota10> Yeah glad I played DMC5 early. tho, watching that trailer did also spoil lol
[1:11:42] <Man_in_the_Red> @khalcipher in all honesty, would a Deboot have a suprise for the final battle
[1:11:45] <+krispen_wa> krispen_wa subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:11:57] <+fantom_flasch> Yep, the recommended videos for Woolie Vs. DMC5 had thumbnail spoilers
[1:12:09] <+fantom_flasch> Youtube is the worse
[1:12:11] <+fantom_flasch> worst
[1:12:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TC_Lagann But there is though, Woolie mentioned his spoiler filter tech on the Beastcast
[1:12:14] <%Toynota10> has he been spoiled?
[1:12:15] <ArbyW> anyone else think the announcer in this game sounds like the computer voice from ReBoot.
[1:12:18] <+blastazoid00> That last trailer had Huge spoils

[1:12:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 12 minutes
[1:12:48] <%khalcipher> yeah that i got a a little bit spoiled by the last trailer
[1:12:48] <metrying> @WoolieVersus weird question but is there a chance of a days gone LP?
[1:12:52] <petpurplepanda> Tech
[1:12:53] <ArbyW> "Warning: ring closing" sounds really close to "warning: incoming game"
[1:12:55] <$Bruh_itsTC> @Breakfast_Megapowers wait forreal?
[1:12:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Technically Woolie and Pat SUPER spoiled Devil May Cry 5 for me
[1:13:05] <Rosy_Joan> Youtube spoiled DMC5 for me within the day of release so put that filter on high
[1:13:06] <+blastazoid00> Girls are watching
[1:13:07] <Man_in_the_Red> @blastazoid26 " this person that's totally in the game is in the game"
[1:13:11] <%FistOfMonkey> TODD COWARD
[1:13:12] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Well I think Billy uploaded a bunch, not Woolie but Its next to impossible to completely avoid
[1:13:32] <ArbyW> big sneak
[1:13:34] <%Toynota10> woolieS woolieT
[1:13:36] <+krispen_wa> I spoiled myself because it lets me reject my humanity
[1:13:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TC_Lagann Yeah i think it was an engine filter where you could put keywords in and it would block anytjhing with that in it
[1:13:39] <%Toynota10> woolieF woolieU
[1:13:40] <+fantom_flasch> I'm going into DMC5 accepting all spoilers, I don't really care. I've never really cared much about them
[1:14:24] <%Toynota10> it's just that DMC5 is the most story driven/well acted entry in the series. it's special
[1:14:32] <ArbyW> DMC 5 did actually bring me to tears when I thought about it.
[1:14:36] <$Bruh_itsTC> @Breakfast_Megapowers when i get home that is absolutely the first thing im doing. we may not be in the darkest timeline afterall :')
[1:14:44] <+krispen_wa> Ehh, I liked DMC3's story a bit more
[1:14:53] <ArbyW> Understandable
[1:14:54] <desmondjin96> PORCO DIO
[1:15:02] <ArbyW> they're both very emotional
[1:15:07] <+fatal_penguin_> I guess it just reminds me of the old SBFP days. I like to be surpised as the boys are when I see the episode. Not when Youtube pre-spoils me cause of bullshit ads
[1:15:10] <%theluckyhero> tic
[1:15:15] <%HDmexiqtioner> I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with LIIIIIGHT!
[1:15:18] <ArbyW> but the things 5 puts into context and adds detail to makes me sad.
[1:15:20] <%FistOfMonkey> @krispen_wa i think im with you on that
[1:15:21] <Man_in_the_Red> DMC3 is a full self contained story, DMC is both the beginning and end of an arc
[1:15:23] <bobbydrill> the hype levels in dmc5 are higher than any game ever tho
[1:15:37] <desmondjin96> PORCO D.IO
[1:15:40] <%khalcipher> Im fucking loving DMC 5 and its my first one ty Pat and Woolie for getting me in to the games
[1:15:46] <desmondjin96> PORCO DIO
[1:16:04] <Man_in_the_Red> both stories work as well, i'd like the Dpad get more build up in 5 though
[1:16:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:07] <KazMkII> @WoolieVersus thoughts on the new Part 5 opening?
[1:16:15] <ArbyW> you know
[1:16:18] <%theluckyhero> you can live outside the ring for a while
[1:16:28] <ArbyW> I still think I prefer playing 4 Dante
[1:16:35] <ArbyW> Dante specifically
[1:16:39] <+fantom_flasch> I was pretty tepid on the Vento Aureo OP
[1:16:43] <%Toynota10> @evilkaz he said earlier he liked it and he loves the new ending more
[1:16:52] <+fantom_flasch> But I know the finale of the part is super hype
[1:16:59] <TigerClaws12> mid game white armor monkaS
[1:17:09] <+Trimoon333> not enjoying the fov
[1:17:13] <$Bruh_itsTC> havent watched the newest episode yet, but Fighting gold has been my jam since it started airing
[1:17:15] <%DedlokPM> Yeah. I do not like the new opening or closing song, but love the visuals of both
[1:17:15] <%HDmexiqtioner> Can't wait for someone to pick up that phone
[1:17:17] <KazMkII> I see. I thought it was ok. The music was better than the visuals tbh
[1:17:32] <+krispen_wa> The lack of feeling horny makes any ending inherently worse
[1:17:37] <$Bruh_itsTC> and freakin you as the outro? thats gonna be hard to top
[1:17:38] <%khalcipher> lets change subject so the chat does not spoil stuff to Woolie
[1:17:39] <+krispen_wa> unless its gangsta's paradise
[1:17:44] <KazMkII> watching part 5 really reminds me why I dont rate it that highly in the series
[1:17:53] <Dova573> I like the new opening it reminds me of a classic rock song
[1:18:21] <+krispen_wa> The gang beating the shit out of a random passerby is why I rate it highly
[1:18:27] <+LilNatFour> that was crazy
[1:18:46] <Dova573> Jeses the way that smg fully upgraded sounds
[1:18:51] <Dova573> jesus
[1:19:07] <+krispen_wa> Lawd Jeezus
[1:19:08] <Darthwaffler> You have to shoot them Woolie. You have to SHOOT them Woolie! sbfpPatschwitz
[1:19:11] <TigerClaws12> r-99 is scary af if you can handle the recoil
[1:19:26] <%FistOfMonkey> @dovakhin573 But what about jeses tho
[1:19:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wonder if the owners of Gangsters Paradise just said "No" when DP asked to license it

[1:24:33] <%FistOfMonkey> @tc_lagann Pat and Woolie but Woolie was playing
[1:24:43] <%HDmexiqtioner> When's TF2 PS4?
[1:24:43] <Triplicat> flatline
[1:24:45] <Triplicat> topical
[1:24:56] <Triplicat> what do you guys think of counterstrike tagging being in this game
[1:25:03] <Man_in_the_Red> when's Orange Box stream
[1:25:06] <+HyperCharge_Sam> every time I see TF2, all I think about is Team Fortress 2
[1:25:08] <$JohnnyMedia> i feel like a total idiot, I guess i just didnt realize Woolie was actively trying to teach cuz i watched all their LP's
[1:25:20] <$Bruh_itsTC> @FistOfMonkey i would give anything to watch pat try the trials in mirrors edge while Woolie cackle menacingly
[1:25:29] <$JohnnyMedia> The Titanfall 2 LP was the reason i bought it in the first place ffs
[1:25:33] <extradopeness> Yo
[1:25:51] <%IMDRanged> Great I can see Woolie's player sleeve colors
[1:25:54] <KazMkII> why keep the p2020 over the scout?
[1:25:58] <brianthe12th> Same Johnny
[1:26:14] <haitakaa> apparently cheating is a big issue in Apex
[1:26:20] <+Scrivener_exe> I hope that they fix the hitboxes soon
[1:26:25] <Dova573> You know Ihe scout is kinda good
[1:26:32] <+fatal_penguin_> g7 Scout is the worst
[1:26:37] <Man_in_the_Red> @haitakaa cheating in a popular online shotter, NOOOooo, really???
[1:26:38] <$JohnnyMedia> in fact I'm gonna rewatch those LP's to make up for the sin
[1:26:41] <%cervidaequus> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[1:26:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> When are they gonna mod Pokemon Red into this game?
[1:26:49] <scrumbotime> I just came from finally watching the Titanfall 2 lp on the old channel coincidentally
[1:26:49] <brianthe12th> beat the story a few weeks ago and got up to nearly level 40 in multiplayer, it's a good time
[1:26:52] <bobbydrill> cant believe he ditched the triple take for 2 flatlines
[1:26:56] <petpurplepanda> I love the G7
[1:27:09] <+Scrivener_exe> I really like the G7 too, with a scope
[1:27:12] <+fatal_penguin_> Mirror's Edge one is my fav. Hearing them fangasm over a game I played when it came out too is amazing. Plus, that elevator story
[1:27:16] <haitakaa> @NumberTooBig for some reason it's more of an issue in Apex than other bgs, maybe because fortnite striaght up sues people
[1:27:17] <extradopeness> G7 is great
[1:27:18] <%DedlokPM> When are they going to mod hats into this game?
[1:27:25] <Sir_Dolphinian> my god i was sitting here wondering why the hud keeps flipping between controller and keyboard icons until i remembered who were dealing with here.
[1:27:49] <cmdemorest> 🔴 LIVE NOW

[1:28:08] <%FistOfMonkey> @fatal_penguin_ that elevator shit fucked me up
[1:28:10] <leargo> its the ultimate control setting

[1:28:31] <+fatal_penguin_> Yess the elevator story was the worst. And internal decapitations
[1:28:33] <Sir_Dolphinian> why must he be like this?
[1:28:48] <$Bruh_itsTC> we ARE the Carry
[1:28:56] <haitakaa> wait so he's aiming with controller but moving with keyboard?
[1:29:00] <catwithsunglasses> Looks like it's time to adapt or perish, Woolz
[1:29:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @haitakaa Other way around
[1:29:17] <%DedlokPM> @haitakaa moving with controller, aiming with mouse
[1:29:22] <+KamikazeKeeg> Are we hearing audio from his TV or this actual capture?
[1:29:24] <WSintai> @haitakaa Dont think too hard about it. The human mind cannot comprehend his ways
[1:29:27] <$Bruh_itsTC> Hitbox Shaming in 2019
[1:29:33] <DeathByPoke7> woolie is the tank
[1:29:34] <brianthe12th> i think i saw around 4000 players on ps4 multiplayer recently
[1:29:39] <extradopeness> I don't get it either but it seems to work
[1:29:47] <$ofloofy> woolie would be the tank
[1:29:55] <brianthe12th> thats the peak though, usually around 2-3000
[1:30:09] <Sir_Dolphinian> @TC_Lagann but woolie plays with an even more confusing set up than a hitbox :o
[1:30:20] <%Skullgod> internet went out :(
[1:30:20] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:30:29] <haitakaa> he's actually using his feet to move with a DDR pad
[1:30:35] <$Bruh_itsTC> @Sir_Dolphinian i meant his teammate was shaming his characters Hitbox LUL
[1:30:37] <$JohnnyMedia> Hey Chat, he's using mouse for aim and Joystick for movement right?
[1:30:40] <haitakaa> and aiming with a rock band drum set
[1:30:44] <Rosy_Joan> joysticks are actually super efficient and precise for movement
[1:30:47] <WSintai> I only play Apex Legends with an original Street Fighter 1 arcade cabinet
[1:30:51] <%FistOfMonkey> @johnnymedia Yep
[1:31:00] <Sir_Dolphinian> :oh.. im dumb

[1:31:43] <bobbydrill> wait if hes using half the controller, what does he use instead of face buttons?
[1:31:43] <$Bruh_itsTC> @Sir_Dolphinian but as someone who cant WASD to save their life, i applaud Woolies compromise for controls LOL
