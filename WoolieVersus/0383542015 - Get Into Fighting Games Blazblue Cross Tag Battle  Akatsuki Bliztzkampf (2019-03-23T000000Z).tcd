[0:22:49] <+Hilleltaco> Hey look it's Woolie's team if Merkava didn't exist
[0:22:54] <+GunterDriger6> I'm not a fan of that color tho
[0:23:00] <Tampaoster> cant escape from crossing fucking fate!
[0:23:02] <CalderGaming> akihiko sponsored by Razer
[0:23:04] <%theman515> why is Woolie playing worse DBFZ?
[0:23:18] <didgereedoodah> *better DBFZ
[0:23:26] <%Wool> why is Woolie playing better Marvel
[0:23:28] <gordieda20> Better
[0:23:30] <+projectrad> *better MvCI
[0:23:31] <KogaNoidZX> I actually haven't heard Aki and Chie's intro in this game and I've been playing since day 1
[0:23:31] <+WhyIDie> which one is merkava and which one is chie? I can't tell them apart in this mirror match NotLikeThis
[0:23:32] <KgKid51> SourPls
[0:23:36] <CalderGaming> I can't believe woolie ended up playing his mains from their respective source games anyway
[0:23:36] <NarcissistCactus> the gameplay in this game is definitely better than dbfz
[0:23:38] <sunnythedrunk> Real talk DBFZ is carried by the Dragonball license
[0:23:46] <YeezusPieces1> I'd say BBtag is better than DBFZ I own DBFZ
[0:23:50] <+ultimatetotoro> that's fucked @wool
[0:23:58] <+filmxfilms2> Better Marvel is skullgirls
[0:24:00] <Tampaoster> MORTIS
[0:24:01] <%theman515> You can all have your incorrect opinions
[0:24:01] <leonsnixon> Yoooo
[0:24:04] <%theman515> that's fine
[0:24:05] <CalderGaming> only one of those titles was GOOD enough for Evo Japan Kappa
[0:24:15] <Charredasperity> filmsxfilms laying down the truth
[0:24:16] <+rosetherosiest> is chie's va different?
[0:24:20] <narshguy> Wait who' on which side
[0:24:26] <sunnythedrunk> @theman515 Nah we just don't like holding block for hours
[0:24:27] <+Floofiie> DBFZ would be better if the saiyans didn't have such a similar moveset and the non-saiyans had more viabllity since their movesets are much more varied
[0:24:29] <KogaNoidZX> Nah same one
[0:24:30] <rosen_fenrir> woolie left
[0:24:31] <stabbityrabbit> Hot take: DBFZ has worse gameplay than MvC:I. It's just that MvC:I looks like ass.
[0:24:32] <NarcissistCactus> woolie is on the woolie side
[0:24:32] <rosen_fenrir> p1
[0:24:39] <Tampaoster> DED
[0:24:41] <+rosetherosiest> ah okay, she just sounds off sometimes to me
[0:24:42] <+Floofiie> @stabbityrabbit you ain't wrong
[0:24:43] <+GunterDriger6> for the most part
[0:24:50] <blairINtheUSA> Oof
[0:24:52] <shadicnion500> i havent played cross tag in a bit so im in the lab now
[0:24:53] <Charredasperity> DBFZ would be amazing if there wasw neutral at all, it's still fun, but very samey
[0:24:54] <Triplicat> can't escape from skipping intros
[0:24:58] <Forester_Skippy> i always had the feeling her VA wastn feeling that well on recording day some liens are really bad
[0:24:59] <+Noponiz> razer sponsored akihiko is quite somethibng
[0:25:00] <+WhyIDie> the way super dash is still a huge part of dbfz's meta is still why I haven't gotten into it too much
[0:25:02] <+GunterDriger6> LUL
[0:25:03] <+VoidHaunter> DBFZ is actually a slow game that hides it behind speed lines
[0:25:04] <gatorafan> @stabbityrabbit, Maxmimillian's take is not THAT hot. doodBenny2
[0:25:07] <+ultimatetotoro> can't wait for aino heart to come into this anime fanfic.

[0:25:47] <CalderGaming> Merkava Prime Kreygasm
[0:25:49] <Charredasperity> Best girl right there. Of course I'm talking about Merkava
[0:25:54] <Tampaoster> Is Akihiko a stand Tsukai?
[0:25:58] <ProjectMirra> this is good Merkava color tho
[0:25:59] <stabbityrabbit> @gatorafan Oh yeah, I always forget he says the same thing. People usually lose their minds when I say that though.

[0:33:08] <rosen_fenrir> yes he is
[0:33:14] <ProjectMirra> Merkava would be a cool persona
[0:33:16] <+GuavaLava11> @konekoryugamine 10 bits
[0:33:20] <leonsnixon> Can’t escape from crossing Reggie
[0:33:22] <young_daisuke> its wooolllla

[0:33:34] <konekoryugamine> 100 is the min, so had to do that to
[0:33:36] <+cafefunk> I made the mistake of buying this for Switch
[0:33:39] <rufus2k2> Merkava got some good dang memes
[0:33:43] <konekoryugamine> Shows what I know XD
[0:33:45] <CalderGaming> shinryuken
[0:33:47] <ikasukiz> why does Izayoi say her own name like a Pokemon sometimes
[0:33:52] <ikasukiz> when she attacks
[0:33:57] <konekoryugamine> Oh shit I left off 6 -_-
[0:34:00] <konekoryugamine> FUCK
[0:34:10] <ProjectMirra> because she's only like
[0:34:13] <ProjectMirra> sort of a person?
[0:34:14] <+GuavaLava11> @cafefunk why is that a mistake? there's still a lot of players
[0:34:20] <shadowmaksim> Izayoi is the name of her weapon...sor something like that. Her real name is Tsubaki.
[0:34:25] <ProjectMirra> yeah
[0:34:32] <ikasukiz> i knew that
[0:34:34] <konekoryugamine> Ah well, I'm out of bits, so someone else can donate next .
[0:34:37] <%Zanethepure> To be fair, most UNI characters have a pretty slow clash button
[0:34:37] <Forester_Skippy> yeah basicly that
[0:34:41] <konekoryugamine> I'm just being pedantic.
[0:34:51] <konekoryugamine> OH MY GOD THAT'S CUTE
[0:34:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:54] <didgereedoodah> UNI clash is safe on block though
[0:34:59] <ProjectMirra> Tsubaki's book turns into armor and makes her slightly more evil or something?
[0:35:00] <konekoryugamine> !MOTIVATED
[0:35:00] <@Moobot> 134 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:35:01] <fatherkhopesh> uni clash is -4 on block
[0:35:04] <rosen_fenrir> akichibi!!
[0:35:08] <+goose_attack_almanac> Izayoi is a person being piloted by Equipment.
[0:35:08] <+HiroTSK5> !MOTIVATED
[0:35:12] <CalderGaming> merkava would be a good persona for necalli
[0:35:15] <didgereedoodah> No she turned evil for other reasons
[0:35:21] <+ultimatetotoro> !uptime
[0:35:21] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 35 minutes and 23 seconds
[0:35:21] <didgereedoodah> not the armour's fault
[0:35:26] <ProjectMirra> yeah ok fair enough
[0:35:31] <pyookoomookoo> this game gets crazy once you get into cross combos
[0:35:39] <theordinarypenguin> also uni reverse beat makes their clashes more flexible
[0:35:39] <ProjectMirra> Blazblue story complicated and weird
[0:35:51] <gordieda20> Tsubaki's Weapon makes her blind
[0:35:54] <CalderGaming> everyone is a puppet character in this game if you try hard enough
[0:36:13] <+GuavaLava11> I'm new to this stream but I'm digging it. what games does he usually play?
[0:36:14] <%Solidnick18> yeee
[0:36:14] <+VoidHaunter> @WoolieVersus Should try Akihiko/Yang
[0:36:15] <EnderGamma> this game has a more fun neutral than dbfz imo
[0:36:21] <didgereedoodah> This game is secretly raising a generation of Carl players
[0:36:23] <@Cranky_Construct> I know how they could save Rwby's roster in cross tag

[0:40:13] <%Zanethepure> The Weak points are timing specific in this game rather than setup based
[0:40:13] <+ultimatetotoro> that was appropriate
[0:40:17] <Forester_Skippy> like i hate a ton on platinum but the worst part is she is kinda fun to play tho
[0:40:20] <+ultimatetotoro> fuck platinum

[0:42:53] <ProjectMirra> yeah that's
[0:42:53] <+VoidHaunter> @tehmanicman We don't talk about him.

[0:43:17] <fearjunkie> tfw no pyrrha

[0:43:20] <%sjay449> I would have wanted Qrow... then the troubles happened
[0:43:23] <+ultimatetotoro> mostly because i remember reading the mango
[0:43:28] <%TheOneUpWarrior> woolieDATTEBAYO Nora is best girl
[0:43:35] <+Icy_Rice> 4 moves.
[0:43:36] <ProjectMirra> Nora's a good one
[0:43:43] <rosen_fenrir> mori would put in adam before any other rwby char, pretty sure, he likes his moves
[0:43:43] <+Hilleltaco> @slatersev Literally plays every time she hits low health
[0:43:45] <SuavisLies> @ultimatetotoro I like mangos
[0:43:46] <rosen_fenrir> and i agree
[0:43:51] <fearjunkie> tfw no Neo
[0:43:52] <pillowwasp> Where’s sub zero
[0:43:54] <slatersev> I joke
[0:43:56] <young_daisuke> this reminds me of king of fighter hella quarter circles
[0:43:57] <CalderGaming> @ultimatetotoro nasuverse (fate/tsukihime/etc.) would be nice to see, yeah
[0:44:00] <rosen_fenrir> we need vilains a he's movesets are fucking cool

[0:44:21] <ProjectMirra> everythings a qc unless it's a 22
[0:44:22] <%sjay449> Gunchuck animations would be nuts
[0:44:22] <@Solidus_113> Winter is lame
[0:44:23] <rosen_fenrir> winter would be interesting

[0:44:50] <rosen_fenrir> ohh WE NEED MARIA CALAVERA+

[0:44:59] <%sjay449> PUSH MARIA
[0:45:00] <fearjunkie> @rosen_fenrir YES
[0:45:02] <+HiroTSK5> How was Season 6?
[0:45:06] <ProjectMirra> better
[0:45:08] <NarcissistCactus> imagine naming winter before neo atpCap

[0:45:10] <%sjay449> Better
[0:45:11] <rosen_fenrir> YESSSSS MARIA THE GRIMM REAPER
[0:45:13] <pillowwasp> I hate 3d model anime so much. It just looks wrong
[0:45:14] <Forester_Skippy> huys remember mori only wants big titties or smal lgirls i nthis game so dont press your luck too much
[0:45:15] <fearjunkie> Fucking fantastic
[0:45:16] <%TheOneUpWarrior> YAAAS
[0:45:16] <KogaNoidZX> I heard Season 6 was actually good, but I haven't seen it
[0:45:16] <EnderGamma> I feel like a team jnpr would be a more likely set of additions
[0:45:17] <+stupidname37> is Adam just red Vergil
[0:45:22] <rosen_fenrir> so much better
[0:45:27] <fearjunkie> Best Volume since 2

[0:46:55] <Agami23> how do you feel about arcana heart getting in instead of melty blood?
[0:46:55] <+Noponiz> is today 100% bbtag?(no complaints, just asking)
[0:46:57] <+VoidHaunter> @WoolieVersus How do you get more damage out of clash again?
[0:46:59] <KogaNoidZX> I guess we'll get into Active Switch stuff later? Cause that's when I feel like the game really shines with that and Cross Combos
[0:47:00] <+ShadowArcangel> Cause I really want to play Yukiko
[0:47:01] <%ZaibatsuFan> @cool_culainn oooooooh
[0:47:03] <+blackkanye> Dammit I thought this stream was the date I forgot. I remembered the date and it is the 26th but I can't remember what it was. FFFF

[0:47:47] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus If I remember correctly, you also get meter for timing it correctly.
[0:47:53] <+blackkanye> You use the crash indicator thing to time it
[0:47:53] <ProjectMirra> I just pick someone I think looks fun

[0:49:36] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Whens the second DOA6 beta?
[0:49:36] <ElenaManetta> Does 2D vs. 3D affect how a fighting game "feels" when you land hits? Do 3D fighters "feel" better than sprite-based or limited animation for example
[0:49:38] <plushysceptile> They literally just announced a SE Switch version

[0:50:01] <+AmericanaRed> apatSmug apatWrong
[0:50:01] <+VektorTroika> *entirely based on the final boss aesthetic
[0:50:08] <Plague_Nurse> @ursulacat I'm starting too thanks to the super beasts

[0:50:09] <%yuribo26> Bottom or top Kreygasm
[0:50:11] <V1irtuousrabbit> Favorite FG commentator/player?
[0:50:12] <Shin_Tenrei> KAREN let @V1irtuousrabbit see his kids, for the love of God
[0:50:12] <tehmanicman> Wait, you guys don't pick teams with special interactions?
[0:50:13] <NarcissistCactus> boss type
[0:50:16] <twoface1240> I pick characters that i like
[0:50:16] <ZimmiZ> Gachi
[0:50:16] <rosen_fenrir> @WoolieVersus when was the first time you YEYEYEYE
[0:50:17] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie will play bottom OR top
[0:50:18] <+GunterDriger6> that is the same for me
[0:50:19] <zafooru> Woolie is switch confirmed
[0:50:19] <didgereedoodah> Pick the coolest character of the top 10
[0:50:20] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus I know you arent super religious "anymore" but would you still give your soul to the Church of Chie? 🤔
[0:50:24] <%UrsulaCat> good to know
[0:50:24] <bsmusic> LUL
[0:50:33] <%ZaibatsuFan> SAAAAAAAAAAAME
[0:50:34] <gordieda20> Meanwhile he picks Boss characters all the time LUL
[0:50:36] <+Disgrea> Yeah I love Es' aesthetics so much, I bought centralfiction just to play her in training mode
[0:50:37] <plushysceptile> Also, @WoolieVersus how are you digging 7th Stand User? Wound up picking it up after watching you play it after a while.
[0:50:38] <KogaNoidZX> Characters with special interactions is a bonus, like I play Ragna/Blake and I'm surprised those two have one lol
[0:50:38] <ElenaManetta> Hahaha, I do that with TV Shows. I watch entire shows just for a single character.
[0:50:39] <+Shotgundam009> bottom or top you say? TPFufun
[0:50:39] <CalderGaming> whatever keeps you invested in the game and having fun is a fine reason to pick the characters you do
[0:50:40] <+VoidHaunter> @WoolieVersus Forget Skullgirls, when's UNIST?
[0:50:46] <%ZaibatsuFan> Baiken > GG for me
[0:50:49] <leonsnixon> Woolie is a switch confirmed
[0:50:54] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus are u a seme or an uke
[0:50:55] <twoface1240> woolie exactly. I dont like street fighter but i like Cody
[0:50:58] <APB_Harleqyn> I like Ed more than I like Street FIghter... I just wish he didn't hurt me so much :P
[0:51:02] <+VektorTroika> Do you like Big Band more than Skullgirls tho?
[0:51:03] <JetpackMcQuack> Woolie <3s Blanka
[0:51:05] <V1irtuousrabbit> Favorite tournament set of any game? @WoolieVersus
[0:51:07] <theordinarypenguin> @WoolieVersus to celebrate arcana heart getting into BBTAG, when's arcana heart?
[0:51:09] <Forester_Skippy> try out characters that you think are cool and if you really cant click with it for a while pick another that you like and try that one out
[0:51:10] <+WhyIDie> you stick with games you like the feel of playing, more news at 11
[0:51:17] <EnderGamma> I like R.Mika more than sfv
[0:51:17] <Plague_Nurse> Baiken is Top 5 tier waifu
[0:51:20] <+HiroTSK5> I wish we got Story mode Ed and not Huge Quest Ed
[0:51:22] <+Hilleltaco> I'm glad 2B got added to Soul Calibur because now that Voldo's been murdered, what would even be the point anymore
[0:51:25] <+GunterDriger6> And that's the reason I'm still playing Gordeau after the patch.
[0:51:28] <+HunterOfGentlemen> @WoolieVersus is it even worth thinking about getting this on the Switch?
[0:51:30] <twoface1240> Woolie looks like blanka
[0:51:34] <ProjectMirra> I wish SFV wasn't a scam because there's so much there I like
[0:51:36] <+Hilleltaco> I don't want to live in a world without Voldo, but 2B's a close second
[0:51:40] <%UrsulaCat> @twoface1240 don't be mean
[0:51:42] <rosen_fenrir> i stan king, i don't care how low tier he might be
[0:51:45] <Thalchampz> LUL
[0:51:45] <+WhyIDie> if you're a blanka main, you sure as hell know they don't like street fighter LUL
[0:51:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus fair enough
[0:51:49] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:51:50] <+MajiOMNI> But Yoshi was in every Tekken
[0:51:53] <fearjunkie> YUS
[0:51:55] <+GunterDriger6> love the character that much!
[0:51:58] <Plague_Nurse> @projectmirra same. I feel scammed

[0:53:01] <spardanwarrior> @V1irtuousrabbit They're doing an LP instead of a stream
[0:53:10] <+xGreenflame> If they add P5 Makoto you can have Makoto/Makoto VS Naoto/Naoto
[0:53:10] <V1irtuousrabbit> Ohhhhh thats sick
[0:53:26] <%ZaibatsuFan> @xGreenflame GALAXY BRAIN
[0:53:28] <twoface1240> I thought more people will be haten because i hate Street fighter
[0:53:30] <ProjectMirra> does naoto still have his dash nonsense here?
[0:53:35] <Forester_Skippy> they also have 2 noels in the game
[0:53:35] <rosen_fenrir> yang getting hit so much, her semblance must be raging inside
[0:53:39] <Forester_Skippy> we getting there
[0:53:44] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus if they add makoto, are you gonna run a Makoto Chie team called Kick Punch Girls
[0:53:48] <ProjectMirra> like do we know this?
[0:53:53] <didgereedoodah> Naoto K isn't in the game yet
[0:53:56] <%Nomad_Scholar> ugh
[0:53:58] <EnderGamma> not frame but combo number
[0:54:00] <KogaNoidZX> Naoto probably does, I saw the blue afterimage in the trailer but we don't know if you can still do it exactly
[0:54:04] <NinjaTB> Play street fighter 4
[0:54:05] <ProjectMirra> ergh
[0:54:11] <+peri_d0t> why not use yang? she a punch girl
[0:54:22] <rosen_fenrir> wooli is willing to learn yang
[0:54:23] <+peri_d0t> is she bad?
[0:54:23] <%Nomad_Scholar> I was just reminded of that unwashed ass of an episode of death battle
[0:54:27] <+WhyIDie> biggest advice is pushing yourself to learn something means a whole lot more than someone telling you what works
[0:54:36] <%Nomad_Scholar> Yang vs "Tifa"
[0:55:01] <ProjectMirra> I tried to learn naoto in CF but oh man I do NOT love trying to dash into stuff from a standstill
[0:55:04] <silvcrest> Death Battle is bad at research, news at 11
[0:55:08] <rosen_fenrir> i mean, it was more a promotional thing than anything
[0:55:11] <JetpackMcQuack> @woolieversus tips to learn defense?
[0:55:12] <NinjaTB> yoo, real talk, canadian skill level in general is underrated. I fought waaaay more solid canadians on average than americans.
[0:55:13] <young_daisuke> jet set radio

[0:55:21] <Plague_Nurse> Death Battle is a scam
[0:55:40] <ProjectMirra> everything is a scam
[0:55:40] <KogaNoidZX> Oh FluxWaveZ is from Montreal? I played him in one of the BB games and he's really good
[0:55:48] <V1irtuousrabbit> @WoolieVersus JAY Z or Nas?
[0:55:48] <Plague_Nurse> memes aren't
[0:55:59] <+Disgrea> I haven't seen Ally in ultimate tourneys that much
[0:55:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:02] <ProjectMirra> when you sell memes they become a scam
[0:56:02] <%Nomad_Scholar> As much as i love RWBY, I know for a fact none of the girls at the time can beat anyone of Tifa's caliber
[0:56:03] <theordinarypenguin> yang is solid mid-tier, though she's getting buffs in the next patch so who knows how she'll be then
[0:56:08] <%NumberTooBig> @woolieversus think you'll do a Chie/Ruby vs Merkava/Markava matchup Kappa
[0:56:09] <+PetsPlay> i never noticed the character portraits shaking when you get ht
[0:56:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, what is the character you look at in a fighting game that is poison for you?
[0:56:14] <+pantherpiss2> flux plays dragonball? LUL
[0:56:15] <+PetsPlay> thats awesome
[0:56:16] <shadowmaksim> Death Battle is fine if you don't take it seriously. Just learning about the characters, minor nitpicks aside, is fun.
[0:56:28] <V1irtuousrabbit> Flux is a BBTag player he doesn't play DBFZ much

[0:56:38] <jubejube56> Death battle is fine but one minute melee is godlike

[1:01:19] <KogaNoidZX> Cross Combos is what makes Ruby and Gord so good lol

[1:02:12] <ProjectMirra> hurts my brain
[1:02:27] <$shadowblaze94> cheer100 Hey Woolie, recently got more into fighitng games that aren't just Smash in the past year. Having a lot of fun learning BBTag and DBFZ (even if I'm not good at all) And am considering entering local London tourneys. Keep up the good work
[1:02:33] <+Hilleltaco> Imagine if we got Shadow Labrys. Puppets upon puppets
[1:02:35] <EnderGamma> some say whacky. others say nasty.
[1:02:40] <shadowmaksim> I'm fine with people not liking "Arcana Heart" for its cutesy aesthetic as it's not for everyone but it sucks the game gets so misrepresented by people. Like, it's rather tame people.
[1:02:44] <%mgs3ladderscene> Core Values folks
[1:02:50] <%UrsulaCat> mmmmmmadmadness
[1:02:52] <Mucmaster> Did Team Scythe end up getting nerfed yet?
[1:02:52] <+peri_d0t> man I wish I could play fighting games that aren't smash
[1:02:52] <%Solidnick18> it's real fast
[1:02:53] <+blackkanye> Yeah I've been explaining to people that the arcana stuff isn't needed for the arcana characters because the second character takes the spot of them
[1:02:53] <Forester_Skippy> shadow labrys and that dude with the dog from uniest
[1:02:56] <Baconrath> I didnt know you played Izayoi
[1:03:01] <gordieda20> You die Fast AF
[1:03:01] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:03:13] <%GunterDriger6> I think it won't be as wacky after the patch.
[1:03:17] <KogaNoidZX> I actually know nothing about AR, I played 3 for like 20 minutes but I liked Kamui
[1:03:24] <+Shotgundam009> @shadowmaksim thats just how NA is FeelsBadMan
[1:03:25] <didgereedoodah> Gorby is hella nerfed after the patch
[1:03:30] <namelez1> how does defense work in this?
[1:03:30] <Plague_Nurse> poyo
[1:03:39] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah, i love Smash, but i havent played it in a while
[1:03:42] <%ZaibatsuFan> That's Max's approach.
[1:03:42] <%mgs3ladderscene> thats me and ffxiv I put so much time into it I get sick launching it
[1:03:46] <didgereedoodah> block, pushblock
[1:03:47] <+Mawari_> play Garou: mark of the wolves
[1:03:47] <EnderGamma> hold back to block @namelez1
[1:03:48] <+WhyIDie> play against people around your skill level. playing against someone a whole lot worse or a whole lot better to the point you aren't learning anything is boring
[1:03:49] <pyookoomookoo> there's pushblock and burst
[1:03:57] <+VoidHaunter> Gorby will have to actually think about their approach with the patch
[1:04:04] <ProjectMirra> I mean I'm generally just trash at everything so
[1:04:07] <YeezusPieces1> @WoolieVersus Will you be playing any older fgs on Fightcade?
[1:04:10] <%Wool> What's the best way to send information in a large tournament regarding delays, bracket, etc. I was at a 400+ Smash/FGC tourney where pools were late by 4 hours and TOs had no clue what was going on, and organizers were bad with info
[1:04:18] <+VoidHaunter> But Weiss is getting BEEG BUFFS
[1:04:26] <%yuribo26> Or even play a real fighting game Jebaited /jk
[1:04:28] <Triplicat> but if they stagger or delay you get hit obviously
[1:04:29] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus longtime fan, been getting into some stuff yall have hyped. just got into DMC (played hours of the 5 demo and been playing DMC3), and now i gotta get into fighters. i like DBFZ, but am trash. hopefully ill get better tho!

[1:06:49] <@Solidus_113> Yang DOES have Baiken colours, you buy the extra set
[1:06:52] <rosen_fenrir> it is BAIKEN it makes sense because reasons
[1:06:55] <EnderGamma> def baiken
[1:06:57] <OkNow_64> Color 8 is baiken
[1:06:59] <%Solidnick18> air grab is real good
[1:07:00] <+TruSpindash> She does, you have to buy it in the in game store
[1:07:04] <ProjectMirra> I should really get the rest of the colors for everyone
[1:07:08] <+VoidHaunter> @WoolieVersus Kanji has a reverse beat
[1:07:10] <pdogfromccc> wow woolie playing bbtag
[1:07:12] <+MajiOMNI> I just wish I had friends to play fighters with, I don't like driving foir 2 hours to play for 15 minutes with a bunch of strangers
[1:07:21] <%yeknomlive> i thought hers came with it since she was a dlc char
[1:07:23] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus Apologies. I mostly just meant that "Arcana Heart" is no where near as bad as people think it is. Between "anime" and a cutesy aesthetic, people seem to project a lot into the game that isn't there.
[1:07:26] <EnderGamma> Kanji is in the realm of arguably having the worst air dash in the game
[1:07:37] <thunderhog> His falling grab is some cheeky shit
[1:07:52] <Mucmaster> @EnderGamma Worst than Tagger?!
[1:08:00] <EnderGamma> tager doesn't have one
[1:08:04] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:08:07] <rosen_fenrir> yoo oolie, yang and akihiko have an interaction
[1:08:12] <KogaNoidZX> Tager doesn't have an airdash so yeah, I guess Tager's is worse lol
[1:08:13] <+timbob> You.....advance towards me? apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[1:08:21] <gordieda20> The flying EX Shitlord
[1:08:27] <ProjectMirra> is Tager still just
[1:08:27] <EnderGamma> Tager's is none existent
[1:08:32] <EnderGamma> doesn't qualify
[1:08:32] <ProjectMirra> super busted?
[1:08:34] <thunderhog> Falling grab makes for some stupid Oki
[1:08:36] <Forester_Skippy> tagger has an almost uninteruptable close in attack tho
[1:08:37] <GenericSoda> @yo woolie, in P4A Kanji had a great tech trap with the flying tackle and sweep. If it's the same here, delay the chair follow-up aftrerwards and then then command grab. It'll catch people if they tech
[1:08:39] <rosen_fenrir> plase guys, whenever woolie gets ready to try yang for real, remind him of baiken colors
[1:08:45] <Smileyhat> @shadowmaksim I feel the same way about DOA as a franchise and how so many seem to view it as a softcore porn masquerading as a fighting game.
[1:08:46] <+WhyIDie> @Solidus_113 guessing you didn't know, looked it up myself, seems can buy the physical copy on its own. I still regret passing up on the bayonetta 1 physical limited edition
[1:08:46] <+blackkanye> Excuse me why the FUNK isn't woolie playing Akihiko?
[1:08:48] <GenericSoda> oh no how embarassing
[1:08:53] <+VoidHaunter> Yo, is this D-grab December?
[1:08:55] <Nekros4442> huh, so Izayoi doesnt have pips in this game eh?
[1:09:07] <EnderGamma> shout out to moopoke
[1:09:08] <%yeknomlive> i came in late. what's woolie team looking like
[1:09:11] <+blackkanye> @VoidHaunter I didn't know we were allowed to legally talk about that
[1:09:15] <c_ranked> In the corner after kanji 214A you can do the 4A autocombo
[1:09:16] <KogaNoidZX> I just checked, Baiken color is 08 actually
[1:09:19] <ProjectMirra> none of the blafbluhs have their gimmicks entirely intact
[1:09:26] <ProjectMirra> I don't think
[1:09:27] <+VoidHaunter> @Nekros4442 No one has their character bars
[1:09:29] <rosen_fenrir> woolie rocking akihiko merkava, but willing to learn kanji and yang
[1:09:35] <Triplicat> nine has hers, sort of
[1:09:39] <Smileyhat> @yeknomlive Usually Akihiko/Merkava, but learning Kanji and Yang now.
[1:09:40] <ProjectMirra> maybe some of the ones that are more straightforward like Ragna
[1:09:40] <theordinarypenguin> 236C is + on block, and 236B/C can be converted into a combo with 4A
[1:09:42] <+blackkanye> @VoidHaunter what about yukikos flame metter?
[1:09:49] <shadowmaksim> @Smileyhat Oh yeah, "DoA" is another one. It's one of the reason why "6" is taking a more toned down approach in hopes to be taken more seriously.
[1:09:54] <theordinarypenguin> 4A is your fastest normal
[1:09:58] <ProjectMirra> ...
[1:10:07] <GenericSoda> @WoolieVersus in P4A Kanji had a great tech trap with the flying tackle and sweep. If it's the same in this game, delay the chair follow-up after either of those and then then command grab. It'll catch people if they tech
[1:10:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:10:16] <theordinarypenguin> lots of kanji tech involves tech throws and resets
[1:10:18] <CalderGaming> @shadowmaksim too bad they're still falling short of Core Values
[1:10:19] <theordinarypenguin> *tick throws
[1:10:23] <televisedrevolt> Pat's yelling about planes so I'm here now
[1:10:31] <theordinarypenguin> kanji's BnB is just 5AAA 2C
[1:10:35] <+theluckyhero> What's his good low I don't remember
[1:10:37] <theordinarypenguin> or 5BB 2B 214B
[1:10:40] <+peri_d0t> @televisedrevolt classic pat
[1:10:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus A-A-B-B-D.B QUARTER CIRCLE BACK
[1:10:44] <+VoidHaunter> @blackkanye I think it's just Yukiko, Nine, Rachel, Akihiko, and Aigis that have unique bars
[1:10:54] <EnderGamma> they're adding that to combo in next patch @woolieversus
[1:11:07] <KogaNoidZX> I think Kanji's is his autocombo then 4A, whatever the kick is
[1:11:09] <theordinarypenguin> also 4AAA 214A
[1:11:10] <generalve> im still here im still here im still here im stasdnajkdnsdfbhjafrsadf
[1:11:10] <+CaptainJax> @woolieversus Do you think you'll ever stream SMT: Nocturne aka the REAL DMC2?
[1:11:19] <GenericSoda> I really enjoyed Kanji in Ultimax but wow he seems not great here
[1:11:23] <gordieda20> Kanji also has 4AAA
[1:11:30] <generalve> they runied him
[1:11:46] <uberhox> is that billy?
[1:11:48] <c_ranked> Usually you wanna assist after 2CC
[1:11:51] <theordinarypenguin> kanji has alot of tech that no one knows about because no one plays him, and he's also getting pretty massive buffs next patch
[1:11:51] <GenericSoda> He was never great or anything but he was at least like mid tier in Ultimax 1.0
[1:11:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus A/A/B/B/D.B/QUARTER CIRCLE BACK B
[1:11:57] <jubejube56> This just reminds me how much the persona cards in ultimax help make the moves more satisfying
[1:12:02] <+VoidHaunter> Kanji is actually alright after the last patch
[1:12:33] <rosen_fenrir> i love you woolie but that color paltette for yang is hurting my eyes
[1:12:41] <rosen_fenrir> the blue is too much
[1:12:41] <+peri_d0t> ^
[1:12:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> DOWN B
[1:12:44] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus Kanji has a reverse beat from 2B to one of the As. I don't remember which exactly though.
[1:12:44] <ProjectMirra> yeah
[1:12:51] <ProjectMirra> the blue is
[1:12:53] <gordieda20> 2B
[1:13:05] <rosen_fenrir> is too jarring
[1:13:08] <pyookoomookoo> i think this works after the patch
[1:13:14] <+VoidHaunter> @WoolieVersus He meant 2B
[1:13:15] <Triplicat> 5AA 2B is the actual combo.
[1:13:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> if not try A A Down B
[1:13:17] <ManOfReason> yeah kanji is very limited in this
[1:13:34] <EnderGamma> AABB I don't think gatlings until the arcade patch
[1:13:35] <GenericSoda> I always loved how Kanji's shout has that ringing noise to it like he's breaking a mic or something
[1:13:41] <+nameless_majin> oh I'm so glad I made it to the stream!
[1:13:42] <KogaNoidZX> @WoolieVersus try 4AAA, I think he can do something off the autocombo command grab
[1:13:49] <+peri_d0t> wasnt weiss top tier before?
[1:13:56] <rosen_fenrir> no, she never was
[1:13:58] <KogaNoidZX> Nah Weiss was terrible lmao
[1:14:01] <theordinarypenguin> @WoolieVersus 5AAA 2C, 5BB 5AAA 2C, 4AAA 214A are the basic BnBs, kanji has really limited combos without assists
[1:14:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> wow
[1:14:05] <+WhyIDie> ayyyy, 2b?
[1:14:10] <rosen_fenrir> mid tier i thnk? lower mid?
[1:14:17] <+peri_d0t> oh. I don't know much about this game lol
[1:14:20] <Brimner> tier list in this game is like
[1:14:20] <+Hilleltaco> @GenericSoda Doesn't it kill projectiles too?
[1:14:21] <shadowmaksim> No, Weiss has been rather low tier. That's why she's been getting big buffs almost every patch. She's actually decent now.
[1:14:25] <Brimner> 2/3 the acst is mid
[1:14:28] <+VoidHaunter> Weiss is lower mid, but the patch is looking promising
[1:14:30] <rosen_fenrir> it's ok, she's getting buff
[1:14:33] <Nekros4442> I think early early on Flux was rocking Weiss with Nu and was doing well but nobody else was
[1:14:46] <+VoidHaunter> She's getting BIG BUFFED
[1:14:46] <rosen_fenrir> yes, weiss and nu tech was good!
[1:14:51] <GenericSoda> @Hilleltaco Not sure? I only really know him from Ultimax. It could be charged in that for a bigger hitbox and it was -1 on block for tick throws
[1:14:54] <generalve> YOU WANT SOME
[1:14:55] <rosen_fenrir> weis with MASSIVE MUSCLES
[1:15:04] <gordieda20> Woolie Try doing the full 4AAA
[1:15:07] <GenericSoda> great standing B
[1:15:13] <+Story_Ark> is his YOU WANT SOME not as cool here as it was in Arena?
[1:15:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus kanji is just grabs and pokes with his jumping B
[1:15:22] <+VoidHaunter> I play Weiss/Mitsuru so I'm hoping Weiss' buffs even out Mitsuru's nerfs
[1:15:23] <Triplicat> did I drop a letter
[1:15:25] <+Hilleltaco> @GenericSoda I only know Ultimax as well, but it's been a while so I could be remembering wrong
[1:15:27] <rosen_fenrir> you want some is jab i think
[1:15:39] <+Raefer> you can cancel chair into air grab too
[1:15:44] <+Hilleltaco> I was never a Kanji player or anything
[1:15:49] <Triplicat> I did, I fucked up
[1:15:50] <+WhyIDie> anyone here have any 1st hand experience on a good lagless usb adapter for switch to hook up a pc fightstick?
[1:15:53] <+A_mere_shrubb> @WoolieVersus Assist can extend that combo
[1:15:56] <GenericSoda> @Story_Ark I dunno data but it looks great to me.
[1:16:14] <thunderhog> Also note, her B has super armor
[1:16:17] <c_ranked> 2CC is a combo ender, you can’t confirm into super but can still call an assist to follow up
[1:16:25] <EnderGamma> 5B to gorilla your way in
[1:16:33] <generalve> Who is guy with glasses
[1:16:39] <Forester_Skippy> yeag has some decent armor moves
[1:16:41] <GenericSoda> Man Yang's design is so good, she's what Bullet wants to be when she grows up
[1:16:55] <KogaNoidZX> Yang's 214A has armor too
[1:17:21] <theordinarypenguin> god yang's optimal combos are so fucking difficult
[1:17:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:17:34] <@Moobot> 135 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[1:17:48] <EnderGamma> 5AAA 5BB jA jB 236C 5BB jA jB jC @
[1:18:01] <GenericSoda> lol, she has Abigail Punch
[1:18:04] <ProjectMirra> oh man
[1:18:06] <KogaNoidZX> Yang has the late air DP into 5A pickups too
[1:18:06] <+chrishnaw> !uptime
[1:18:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 18 minutes
[1:18:10] <+reiju_22> !MOTIVATED
[1:18:10] <@Moobot> 136 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:18:13] <ProjectMirra> that's a combo that I will NEVER be able to do
[1:18:19] <plushysceptile> Can we see an Astral Finish showcase or show some off? Yang's is pretty good
[1:18:20] <+peri_d0t> yang is so fucking cool
[1:18:29] <ProjectMirra> I can probably steal like, half of it?
[1:18:33] <+VoidHaunter> Burning Gold has super armor
[1:18:34] <%yeknomlive> bionic arm
[1:18:36] <ProjectMirra> before my fingers give up
[1:18:41] <ShreddingPixels> !MOTIVATED
[1:18:41] <@Moobot> 137 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:18:43] <GenericSoda> Can you cancel the startup for that throw into anything? I'm rubbish at avoiding throw mixup but that looks waay too slow to be useful
[1:18:46] <Triplicat> that combo is more or less what every character's combo looks like
[1:18:48] <+Divaofdespair> she also has bionic arm
[1:18:53] <Triplicat> so if you can get that down you are golden
[1:18:54] <didgereedoodah> A lot of her moves have armor
[1:19:03] <ProjectMirra> fair enough
[1:19:03] <+peri_d0t> @divaofdespair not in this game tho
[1:19:03] <+chrishnaw> !motivated
[1:19:06] <Triplicat> try practicing it in parts instead of all at once if you need to
[1:19:13] <ProjectMirra> yeah that helps a lot
[1:19:16] <KogaNoidZX> Nah, really you call assist before you do Yang's throw then active switch for themixup
[1:19:22] <+VoidHaunter> When can we just get a RWBY fighting game
[1:19:30] <GenericSoda> When is Persona 5 Arena
[1:19:36] <rosen_fenrir> i mean, there's some talk about possibilitites
[1:19:37] <%yeknomlive> @VoidHaunter think arc said they'd be happy to if they get the chance
[1:19:39] <ProjectMirra> I'm pretty bad at labbing in general but that's more a lack of diligence than anything else
[1:19:42] <+peri_d0t> @voidhaunter when rooster teeth gets money
[1:19:44] <rosen_fenrir> yes, mori wants to i think
[1:19:44] <fearjunkie> @VoidHaunter ArcSys has been hining at it
[1:19:49] <rosen_fenrir> but need to now people want it
[1:19:50] <EnderGamma> need to do 2C before the 214A B
[1:19:51] <Nekros4442> Rooster Teeth has the money for it lol
[1:19:58] <fearjunkie> *hinting
[1:20:08] <ProjectMirra> Rooster Teeth has the money to make the worlds ugliest car, so
[1:20:12] <+critfumble_> RT would try to make it in house and it probably wouldnt be great
[1:20:18] <+peri_d0t> ^
[1:20:19] <GenericSoda> they have the money to can vic lol
[1:20:21] <Nekros4442> RT would not try to make it in house
[1:20:23] <theordinarypenguin> if you wanna spend hours practicing optimal combos for yang, do: 5AAA 5BB jc. j.BAA~j.A+D 5AA 2C 214AA
[1:20:31] <Nekros4442> They have no fighting game specialists there
[1:20:32] <rosen_fenrir> arcsys wants to tho
[1:20:32] <thunderhog> 5p is a wallbounce as well, so you stuff off of it
[1:20:34] <+critfumble_> they made the other game in house
[1:20:36] <+peri_d0t> like that Grimm eclipse game
[1:20:38] <%yeknomlive> yang has some good corner combos
[1:20:43] <rosen_fenrir> that was waaaay before
[1:20:43] <Nekros4442> They have connections with ArcSys already
[1:20:47] <+peri_d0t> wasnt very.good
[1:20:49] <rosen_fenrir> rt has more moola now
[1:20:50] <ProjectMirra> I remember that game being ok?
[1:20:54] <ProjectMirra> not great?
[1:21:02] <rosen_fenrir> it was pretty ok
[1:21:04] <ProjectMirra> like it felt decent iirc
[1:21:04] <GenericSoda> yeah, Mori loves RWBY so I wouldn't be surprised if he'd produce more RWBY games
[1:21:11] <Forester_Skippy> that game wasso bad before it got fixed too lol
[1:21:15] <ProjectMirra> oh man yeah
[1:21:15] <+Hilleltaco> I liked the RWBY characters in this better than most of the others, because they're original and I'm not fighting muscle memory constantly
[1:21:20] <rosen_fenrir> please BAIKEN COLORS WOOLIE
[1:21:21] <+peri_d0t> @projectmirra it was fun for the first hour then it gets VERY tedious
[1:21:24] <fearjunkie> The new deckbuilding game's fun
[1:21:28] <ProjectMirra> yeah that sounds about right
[1:21:33] <NarcissistCactus> don't tell him about baiken atpCap
[1:21:35] <ProjectMirra> for that gameplay
[1:21:49] <thunderhog> Thats if woolie reads
[1:21:56] <SabreX> yeah but chances of getting more rwby characters are going down the drain way way fast
[1:21:56] <GenericSoda> get Kanji's Kakyoin color
[1:22:01] <ProjectMirra> he commented on it ages ago, I think
[1:22:16] <+peri_d0t> 8 is baiken
[1:22:19] <SabreX> if next pack of characters don't reveal them, they're done
[1:22:30] <+peri_d0t> WOLLIE WHY

[1:26:00] <+VoidHaunter> I looked up that Triple Q remix. I should have listened.
[1:26:04] <thunderhog> it was admirable at least around season 2. once the creator died they just milked the hell out of it

[1:27:02] <Forester_Skippy> @fearjunkie oh yeah woops
[1:27:04] <GenericSoda> Does Kanji's super grab have the same frame data from P4A/Ultimax?
[1:27:05] <+Story_Ark> yikes, oof
[1:27:10] <%NumberTooBig> think looking up a supercut of all the fights in order would give any semblance of a story LUL
[1:27:11] <%KingLlama1> Thats why I want Bang in this game, I want his Install to over-ride the BGM ... so the dream is Yang/Bang and just mess with the music the whole time
[1:27:14] <+VoidHaunter> Taiyang is a Chad
[1:27:33] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> @GenericSoda no it comes out much faster
[1:27:42] <pdogfromccc> overhead shoulder charge is not safe

[1:28:07] <GenericSoda> @Danndy_Guy_in_Space in Ultimax if the superflash came out and you were right next to the other guy it's a 0 frame throw, so it's not like it can get any faster, lol

[1:40:12] <+VektorTroika> *ruby vocalizes* "Oof yikes"
[1:40:14] <KogaNoidZX> Ragna gets better in every new BB game, like Gauntlet Hades in this game is so damn good
[1:40:15] <scorchedbacon> BEST BOIS
[1:40:17] <+Hilleltaco> When's Nu/Vatista

[1:40:41] <%Solidnick18> yeee
[1:40:45] <thunderhog> Yeah and his persona gets Phyra colors
[1:40:54] <rosen_fenrir> that's jaune's palette
[1:41:00] <fearjunkie> @thunderhog aaand i'm crying now
[1:41:00] <NarcissistCactus> play red like roses to kill the stream
[1:41:01] <+Tonku_the_Red> doodYelp I BUURRNN!!!
[1:41:04] <scorchedbacon> Ragna is legit the best DeviantArt OC
[1:41:18] <fearjunkie> Does Yang always hijack the OST?
[1:41:20] <ProjectMirra> I'd like Ragna more if I liked playing him
[1:41:26] <ProjectMirra> @fearjunkie yes
[1:41:28] <thunderhog> Yep, EVERY TIME she goes burning
[1:41:32] <Forester_Skippy> yeah yang always ruins the good songs
[1:41:38] <+TheIntellectional> guilty gear needs to be in this game so sol can have a theme music battle with yang
[1:41:38] <+Tonku_the_Red> @fearjunkie Every time her HP is low.
[1:41:48] <scorchedbacon> I've been playing him since CT so I'm a bit biased lol
[1:41:48] <KogaNoidZX> Ragna is fun as hell in Tag though, he got Belial Edge combos back from CS2
[1:41:53] <ProjectMirra> man I genuinely hate sol's design
[1:41:54] <NarcissistCactus> ruins the good songs with an even better song
[1:41:56] <ChaoxShadow> LUL
[1:41:58] <+Hilleltaco> Is that how EXS is pronounced?
[1:41:59] <rosen_fenrir> WELL

[1:42:19] <ProjectMirra> I just
[1:42:20] <rosen_fenrir> CHECK HER ASTRAl wooli come on!!
[1:42:28] <ProjectMirra> something about it does NOT work for me
[1:42:31] <thunderhog> yeah, but probably instincts just kick in before he remembers
[1:42:31] <ProjectMirra> *shrugs*
[1:42:41] <NarcissistCactus> go watch max react to bb tag astrals atpShh
[1:43:13] <rosen_fenrir> he could try it, just saying :v
[1:43:14] <pdogfromccc> if he is just going to mash buttons on you yang can pushblock super
[1:43:25] <ProjectMirra> I dunno my tastes in character designs are just weird in general tho so
[1:43:29] <didgereedoodah> @WoolieVersus when Yang powers up you can take advantage of the screen freeze and DP or super if they are hitting a button
[1:43:37] <+theluckyhero> RAAAAAAAAAAAAW
[1:43:43] <%yuribo26> SugarPunch has the videos on ArcSys supers
[1:43:47] <%yuribo26> best videos*

[1:44:05] <+theluckyhero> Ohhhh that was a low
[1:44:11] <NarcissistCactus> harder than dbfz
[1:44:15] <Nekros4442> i'd say it's harder than both games
[1:44:21] <+Tonku_the_Red> PokBlaziken I BURN!!!!! PokCharizard
[1:44:26] <Nekros4442> Tag mechanics makes this game nutty

[1:44:29] <+theluckyhero> Ooooooooooohhhhh noooooooo

[1:44:34] <+Hilleltaco> apatHoldon
[1:44:35] <%NumberTooBig> @ultimatetotoro easy to start, takes a bit to wrap your head around the tag mechanics
[1:44:41] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus If you 360 the command grabs, they actually do a bit more damage.
[1:44:42] <%ZaibatsuFan> BAHNING!
[1:44:51] <Triplicat> whens yosuke
[1:44:53] <+Devilbringer133> game's easy executionally, but is extremely unforgiving to mistakes

[1:45:28] <fearjunkie> Prepare for pain
[1:45:30] <theordinarypenguin> 360 command grabs do more damage for tager and wald at least, dunno about kanji
[1:45:32] <thunderhog> i mean the game has auto combos and easy bursts, so at first it feels easy, but mastering mechanics and doing stuff like those cross up set ups are what takes up your life

[2:08:54] <ProjectMirra> Carmine's a good
[2:08:55] <+Tennochief> or Jade
[2:08:56] <mistersups> Probably Liscence reasons in DBfZ
[2:08:58] <%Uulyaoth> 5 lets you set them individually
[2:08:59] <itsgutsnotgatsu> this game has character by character voices as well
[2:09:01] <xiccy> 5 deffo has it

[2:09:28] <fearjunkie> It's gotta be something relating to Green or Purple
[2:09:29] <Forester_Skippy> yeah most people have all english voices except ruby

[2:10:20] <+Runato> "Kick my ass, I'm world class, and super saiyan now!"
[2:10:22] <ElenaManetta> Is playing a game "competitively" something that, by it's nature, can't be a "hobby"?

[2:23:32] <+Tonku_the_Red> Punch team vs. full screen teram
[2:23:32] <KogaNoidZX> Blake is great, she just has execution requirements
[2:23:34] <+Runato> Did Woolie see the new chars for later?
[2:23:36] <EnderGamma> yes
[2:23:43] <thunderhog> Oh yeah theres notes. Some characters are getting replaced assists @WoolieVersus
[2:23:43] <HonestHero> When the team doesn’t match Colors DendiFace DendiFace
[2:23:51] <EnderGamma> but bunch of characters are getting buffed
[2:23:55] <Derq> @WoolieVersus Akihiko got MAD buffs
[2:23:55] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus My boy Lado got kicked, he was in the front of the line, you mind if he takes his spot back? he's at the back currently cause he doesnt wanna look like he cut
[2:23:57] <+NoxAlchemist> japan already plays it a lot i think
[2:24:03] <nitro4life2> The're 17 pages of Patch Notes
[2:24:06] <HonestHero> @thunderhog Yep, Naoto has a new assist
[2:24:06] <+blackkanye> Freakin Gordeau got murked
[2:24:11] <+Tennochief> I hope they get more character interactions
[2:24:15] <+WhyIDie> they should replace some of those assists in dbfz FeelsBadMan
[2:24:16] <+Runato> @WoolieVersus Have you seen the new characters coming up?
[2:24:18] <+Tennochief> we need A LOT more of them
[2:24:19] <+NoxAlchemist> nah gord is dead
[2:24:19] <+cowkid222> does Japan care about RWBY? genuinely curious
[2:24:21] <+HiroTSK5> feels like that change is explicitly for Gordeau
[2:24:21] <CrimsonBrave> merkava is one of them lol
[2:24:24] <%GunterDriger6> LUL
[2:24:28] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that was a cool combo
[2:24:28] <@Solidus_113> I want to live in a world where every assist fighter has custom assists like Skullgirls FeelsBadMan
[2:24:28] <+Hilleltaco> Put Voldo in
[2:24:29] <didgereedoodah> @WoolieVersus Akihiko got hella buffs
[2:24:32] <%yuribo26> LUL
[2:24:32] <itsgutsnotgatsu> new Linne 6P is good shit
[2:24:34] <ProjectMirra> Japan LOVES RWBY
[2:24:38] <+Tennochief> @cowkid222 Japan still cares
[2:24:39] <ProjectMirra> it's really weird
[2:24:40] <itsgutsnotgatsu> yu got a new 6P also
[2:24:42] <CrimsonBrave> his forward assist is now ex fireball
[2:24:44] <HonestHero> @cowkid222 High school girls and battle shounen? Yep they do
[2:24:45] <NarcissistCactus> what is linne's new 6P
[2:24:46] <+Runato> RWBY is HUGE in JP, it's the RT property that let them crack into the JP market
[2:24:46] <g15835> @honesthero I think they contrast each other in the right way.
[2:24:50] <SixthSun2> Japan loves RWBY more than anyone should
[2:24:53] <EnderGamma> @woolieversus aki is getting armor on hook and invulnerability on sonic punch
[2:24:59] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus My boy Lado got kicked, he was in the front of the line, you mind if he takes his spot back? he's at the back currently cause he doesnt wanna look like he cut
[2:25:00] <itsgutsnotgatsu> linne new 6P is ex Kuuga
[2:25:01] <+Hilleltaco> Everyone's team quotes with Voldo would just be like "I don't know if I'm okay with this"

[2:27:54] <+TransporterX7> oh hey YUZU HYPE
[2:27:56] <%NumberTooBig> Waldstein is worthy of a ballad
[2:27:59] <Shindeil> @Alex_Eight It definitely got better, but I STILL don't like the 3D animation. But it's fine. I watch anime, instead.
[2:28:03] <@Cranky_Construct> The setting's perfect for some really fun fight characters
[2:28:04] <NarcissistCactus> yuzuriha bathwater atpChar
[2:28:07] <+VoidHaunter> Wald is half-man, half-void. He's a weird monsterman.
[2:28:13] <%yuribo26> Why are UNIST designs so fucking godlike Kreygasm
[2:28:22] <fearjunkie> there's a podcast title

[2:29:36] <%NumberTooBig> @woolieversus think you can run my team, Samurai and Pizza Cat (Yuzu/Jubei)
[2:29:39] <Datwiseguy> Platinum tager cowards
[2:29:44] <CirclesForever> ill feel chie
[2:29:50] <%sjay449> imo, the coolest thing about this game is Monty Oum's dream came true. He was telling Gootecks and Mike Ross on their show in 2014 his dream was a RWBY fighting game at EVO
[2:29:58] <%sjay449> it's sad he couldn't see it
[2:29:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i will hunt you in all games woolie on ps4
[2:29:59] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus My boy Lado got kicked, he was in the front of the line, you mind if he takes his spot back? he's at the back currently cause he doesnt wanna look like he cut

[2:30:43] <%Eaglestrike117> YEah i can
[2:30:45] <KogaNoidZX> yeah he did
[2:30:46] <+Tennochief> @Eaglestrike117 was he the Jubei?
[2:30:50] <%Eaglestrike117> He's a discord boy
[2:30:50] <+ZippyPsycho> You can get kicked if you're inactive so it happens
[2:30:54] <fearjunkie> WoolieHunting....Plague?!
[2:30:55] <mightyramuh> I can indeed verify
[2:30:55] <%Eaglestrike117> No he's the Gord
[2:30:59] <+cafefunk> That cute pink hair girl and Teddie look exciting, any release date?
[2:31:06] <+Runato> Spring 2019
[2:31:07] <NarcissistCactus> atpCap we got him
[2:31:07] <EnderGamma> eventually
[2:31:10] <itsgutsnotgatsu> i can verify lado
[2:31:19] <fearjunkie> Keep Plague away from RWBY, he can't learn of the Faunus
[2:31:25] <%yeknomlive> nice
[2:31:26] <thunderhog> Kanji yang is weirldly a good team. played it myself
[2:31:28] <+EastwindGuru> tksClapped
[2:31:37] <ProjectMirra> Teddie keeping the bat scares me a bit, honestly
[2:31:40] <+VFXMario> Yo. Sup everybody!
[2:31:42] <Datwiseguy> GAME ALREADY END QUICKLY
[2:31:43] <+Tennochief> Plague would have a lot of problems with RWBY's writing
[2:31:49] <+Tennochief> especially with Miles and Kerry
[2:31:54] <pyookoomookoo> the faunus are tame compared to what plague's used to
[2:31:55] <gordieda20> @vfxmario Hello
[2:32:01] <+Runato> I wanna see some Seth and of course Heart stuff soon
[2:32:01] <fearjunkie> Teddie better get a Junior color
[2:32:04] <+WhyIDie> if they put snapbacks in, then they'd have to have some counter snapback mechanic, and then we have another system put over on top of it all NotLikeThis
[2:32:07] <%GunterDriger6> THAT WOULD BE SOOO CRUEL!!!
[2:32:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Datwiseguy
[2:32:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> GG
[2:32:10] <Smart_ZaK1> YOOO
[2:32:11] <HonestHero> @tennochief Plague would have a FIELD DAY with RWBY
[2:32:17] <Datwiseguy> sorry moobot
[2:32:23] <+Shin0bus_> Did I miss my sick ass Skull Tank gameplay?
[2:32:31] <+EastwindGuru> I know damage is high in this game but is Chie a glass cannon or does Yang hit like a truck?
[2:32:32] <+Tennochief> @HonestHero VOL. 5 would be annihalted
[2:32:36] <%Eaglestrike117> Thats his name
[2:32:39] <+cafefunk> Fingers crossed Persona 5 R means Rumble
[2:32:39] <HonestHero> RWBY writing makes Dragon Ball super look like Hunter X Hunter
[2:32:40] <+VFXMario> @gordieda20 CoolCat
[2:32:40] <EnderGamma> the games already finish in a fraction of the time of dbfz. snapbacks would guarantee this game is 3 out of 5
[2:32:44] <%Eaglestrike117> I can verify
[2:32:45] <+Floofiie> ye
[2:32:50] <NarcissistCactus> gg I was lado :)

[2:33:11] <K_ross> I wish Chie wasn’t ass in this game :(
[2:33:11] <%Eaglestrike117> That kid owes me money for getting him a match
[2:33:12] <+Floofiie> UNGA
[2:33:15] <+Hilleltaco> I wish "I Burn" would cut off when Yang died so you could have it start and just immediately stop
[2:33:16] <Forester_Skippy> time for unga
[2:33:20] <+VFXMario> snapbacks would be too much honestly.
[2:33:20] <+Tennochief> GALS VS UNGA BUNGA
[2:33:23] <@Menitta> I remember being booted from DBFZ a few times so its possible

[2:33:47] <+Tennochief> Now they just need to fight shirtless in the rain

[2:35:17] <ProjectMirra> she's also my second favorite girl in P5 so
[2:35:27] <%theraden> I know this is a total side note but did Woolie mention Darkest Dungeon 2?
[2:35:33] <+CoRascal> DIS MY BOY
[2:35:35] <@Menitta> Makoto is the name of many great characters.
[2:35:36] <HonestHero> Is “Core Values” going to exist forever as a meme
[2:35:37] <EnderGamma> the fact pushblock and DP are the same make for great pushblock baits
[2:35:39] <+CoRascal> lets go Celcifen
[2:35:40] <+Tennochief> that works

[2:36:57] <BGN_Spiral> this game is arguably the most popular game outside of the big 3 (SFV, DBFZ, T7)

[2:37:45] <+cafefunk> Is this game really more popular than Guilty Gear?
[2:37:46] <fearjunkie> Because FUCK ME that was the best song from ol 5
[2:37:54] <EnderGamma> yuzu is difficult to block online
[2:37:57] <slatersev> Nevermore for Yang and Blake teams
[2:37:59] <+NoxAlchemist> idk those games have weirdly low numbers for how many people play them
[2:38:04] <+Tennochief> OH
[2:38:06] <+Grayhammatter> PogChamp

[2:38:11] <fearjunkie> brutal
[2:38:11] <Charredasperity> EVO will put in any fighting game once...unless its Skullgirls
[2:38:11] <BGN_Spiral> I hate that I Burn plays during almost every single Yang matcg

[2:38:43] <+VFXMario> I find myself going back to Cross Tag more than most other fighting games atm. but I was sold thanks to unist cast being included LUL
[2:38:44] <+tz_toast_rider> @bgn_spiral I hate that I Burn doesn’t play in matches without Yang
[2:38:53] <K_ross> We can’t end this stream without a Naoto insta-kill
[2:38:57] <HonestHero> I forgot Bullet isn’t in this game
[2:39:00] <+Hilleltaco> Akihikeau
[2:39:07] <+NoxAlchemist> it's a crime
[2:39:09] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:39:17] <TheTacoduke> Yang is just discount Bullet
[2:39:20] <Charredasperity> I wish this game wasn't dead on PC, I know PS4 is the platform for fighters, but my stick isn't compatable with it
[2:39:23] <scorchedbacon> She's likely, I think
[2:39:23] <Vashido22> @TheTacoduke facts
[2:39:28] <Vashido22> I do like Yang tho
[2:39:33] <Vashido22> But Bullet is better
[2:39:34] <TheTacoduke> Yang is fun
[2:39:36] <fearjunkie> Anyone else got audio desync?
[2:39:37] <Datwiseguy> did someone play a match where the sone picked was shadow world?

[2:46:38] <Vashido22> @EnderGamma also true
[2:46:39] <StarMechV> I can't believe they are adding two more franchises, yet RWBY still only gets 4 characters
[2:46:41] <scorchedbacon> And his brother
[2:46:41] <+Tennochief> Penny
[2:46:44] <NarcissistCactus> it's because there are 7 characters per slide and only 4 rwby characters
[2:46:44] <rosen_fenrir> kinda, you mean penny
[2:46:45] <Vashido22> Penny
[2:46:47] <ProjectMirra> and his sister, but a robot

[2:52:33] <ProjectMirra> either King or Leona, definitely
[2:52:35] <%UrsulaCat> king is good but like I just like her becaue she reminds me of myself
[2:52:36] <+McSoliace> Vanessa is the only choice

[3:01:04] <gunzerkingdunce> @tennochief its gotten back to those with the latest
[3:01:05] <fearjunkie> vol 6 ruled
[3:01:07] <aiyobro> rwby sprites came from the creators, so they were in 1080p the rest are anti-aliased
[3:01:09] <@Menitta> @gunzerkingdunce I only saw the first season. Its got too many issues for me to look past it and enjoy the designs
[3:01:12] <Vashido22> VOL 6 was good
[3:01:13] <%GunterDriger6> yeyeye!
[3:01:19] <+TruSpindash> Volume 6 was actually good

[3:01:30] <gunzerkingdunce> @menitta to each their own my friend
[3:01:30] <ProjectMirra> the first season is a huge mess and it's such a problem
[3:01:30] <+Tennochief> @rosen_fenrir the first half was good, and the second to last episode was great, the finale was just a let down
[3:01:40] <rosen_fenrir> is over and free in the rt site

[3:02:23] <+VoidHaunter> I just like Weiss

[3:02:26] <KogaNoidZX> @WoolieVersus GG's man, been a fan for a while dood
[3:02:28] <rosen_fenrir> @Tennochief i respectfuly disagree, i think the last few chapters got some issues pacing wise but i enjoyed it

[3:36:52] <%UrsulaCat> you dumbass math loser
[3:36:53] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus Is this game from the same people who made Underknight? Because Akatsuki is a character in there as well.
[3:36:54] <%yuribo26> 2/3 Nazi ratio
[3:36:55] <$Punisher7771> for the fatherland
[3:36:55] <K_ross> @woolieversus Just do you Akatsuki isn’t a Nazi Kappa
[3:36:58] <mistersups> 66.6%
[3:37:01] <arkv01> I'm SURE we can convert them into good canadian citizens and not nazis
[3:37:01] <+Willdog1993> Quick Maths
[3:37:03] <%yeknomlive> 3/5's a nazi
[3:37:05] <%Nmiser> nazis created math confirmed
[3:37:07] <@Menitta> Do Gun Nun! She's great in SB
[3:37:08] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> @WoolieVersus That is an impure NAZI Roster.
[3:37:09] <gryffinp> I don't know, niumber 4 seems more Wehrmacht than nazi
[3:37:10] <Bloogoose> "66% to select a Nazi" is a podcast title
[3:37:12] <stormhawk9891> Fuck yeah Fritz!!
[3:37:12] <%alrobot2014> look to the character to the left and right of you, they're probably nazis
[3:37:14] <EnderGamma> 8/12 chances to main an antisemitic character

[3:37:46] <lbrownthedestroyer> did he show the tank yet?
[3:37:47] <DrDomVonDoom> Nazis were far ahead at the time in their jiggle physics
[3:37:50] <@Solidus_113> so Woolie, you said this game was about the ultimate runbacks? I don't think that worked out well in WW2 @WoolieVersus
[3:37:59] <%yeknomlive> she has jams hs
[3:37:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:38:02] <%yuribo26> @lbrownthedestroyer he scrolled through all the characters

[3:39:10] <Vashido22> So, ACTUAL Nazis? For real?
[3:39:14] <RJroy0> @vashido22 Yes. Though I think the main character turned traitor? I swear his nickname was Nazipuncher or something
[3:39:15] <+Coastalmixx> Nazi wan Kenobi
[3:39:30] <arisekicked> this isn't even the most nazi fighting game woolie has played either remember
[3:39:30] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:39:31] <Vashido22> So, Akatzuki used to be a nazi
[3:39:34] <@Menitta> ppg
[3:39:35] <%yeknomlive> that was a samsho like finish
[3:39:37] <+cafefunk> Her sexy mistress gloves give me Anna Williams vibes
[3:39:40] <gryffinp> Woolie is having way more fun than his friends with the nazism
[3:39:41] <@Menitta> oof

[3:40:40] <+Tennochief> @WoolieVersus Have you ever watched Thunderbolt Fantasy, it's legendary puppetry by the Urobutcher
[3:40:48] <RJroy0> @vashido22 I think? Don't quote me on that. I think because one of the Nazis is his rival & turned on him so he has no choice. If I remember my lore right
[3:40:48] <DrDomVonDoom> @tiger
[3:41:02] <Vashido22> Ohh got it

[3:51:26] <N1netbattler> When did Wakka get here???
[3:51:30] <+VoidHaunter> Shout outs to Squish
[3:51:30] <%mistspade> Isn't akatsuki a Japanese spy or something?
[3:51:40] <+WizardofAahz> he fights for bathwater
[3:51:45] <arkv01> wait hold on
[3:51:45] <aiyobro> he's an imperial super soldier who fights with literacy
[3:51:46] <RJroy0> @mistspade imperial officer
[3:51:49] <arkv01> akatsuki is a japanese german spy?
[3:51:49] <%yeknomlive> sick combos
[3:51:51] <SleepyMaribo> YO THATS COOL
[3:51:53] <BwdYeti> LUL
[3:51:54] <arkv01> so is he pretending to be a nazi?
[3:51:59] <HefestoForges> so are his hadoukens Reichukens?
[3:51:59] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:52:00] <mistersups> Still Imperial Japan. Not that much better
[3:52:03] <+VoidHaunter> There are no Nazis in this game
[3:52:11] <+VoidHaunter> Fake news
[3:52:11] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:52:18] <Datwiseguy> isnt akatsuki top tier in thisgame
[3:52:26] <xiccy> He fights for the right to drink bathwater
[3:52:27] <+blackkanye> But I thought this was jew puncher
[3:52:28] <tacostarvedbeast> I mean spying on ur allies is not uncommon
[3:52:33] <Sebthemachinist> SOMEONE BETTER PLAY THAT TANK
[3:52:36] <+Netorares> You guys heard about the new DMC5 Hyde Collab Trailer released today?
[3:52:39] <SleepyMaribo> pick the nun!
[3:52:41] <aiyobro> he oppresses communist with western technology
[3:52:41] <arkv01> hey man I'll drink marilyns bathwater
[3:52:58] <HefestoForges> Sai with Takahata colors
[3:52:58] <+blackkanye> Gun nun is third best nun
[3:53:15] <+TopTieramisu> this guy looks like the love child of andy bogard and oswald
[3:53:23] <tacostarvedbeast> @blackkanye so double and who else?
[3:53:31] <RJroy0> No wookz, there are Nazis, Akatsuki is an imperial officer thought to be dead
[3:53:35] <+RoboBro1212> whole new meaning to footsies 😏
[3:53:37] <%fatal_penguin_> Show us your FEET, boys
[3:53:39] <RJroy0> woolz*
[3:53:40] <+WhyIDie> I don't see the issue, just grab his hair and he's beat LUL
[3:53:45] <+blackkanye> I forgot about double. The only nuns I thought of when I wrote that were Clarice and the other one from Arcana Heart
[3:53:50] <%KingLlama1> He looks like one of the villians from Giant Robo
[3:53:54] <thesw1tch> who's the most evil regime in history? nazis are pretty fucking top tier in that category
[3:54:13] <HefestoForges> fucking mongols under genghis khan
[3:54:14] <+TopTieramisu> imperial japan isn't far behind them
[3:54:17] <aiyobro> the japs wore british helmets during the war, they got iron from germany and oil from the netherlands but just a small amount
[3:54:17] <+bfgcludi> Damn bbtag looks sick nowadays
[3:54:28] <%fatal_penguin_> Mongol were pretty rough. Mountains of skulls, com'on
[3:54:32] <arkv01> @thesw1tch probably stalin or mao?
[3:54:32] <Shindeil> I saw an arcade machine with this game at a mall I went to.
[3:54:33] <TigerClaws12> what's the parry input?
[3:54:36] <+RoboBro1212> imperial japan is arguably worse than the nazis war crimes-wise
[3:54:42] <HefestoForges> and the romans were basically successful nazis
[3:54:44] <Shindeil> Akatsuki Blitzkampf
[3:54:46] <+RoboBro1212> maybe not in sheer volume but the camps were even worse
[3:54:51] <tacostarvedbeast> I forget is Bridget a “nun”?
[3:54:51] <+Netorares> New DMC5 trailer today is a top-tier hype machine
[3:54:57] <+TopTieramisu> i'd only put nazis higher because imperial japan didn't seek to literally commit genocide
[3:55:02] <+Irridium> new whatnow
[3:55:18] <Datwiseguy> wei is a cool guy
[3:55:22] <N1netbattler> TFW everyone misses
[3:55:22] <%NumberTooBig> there seems to be a distinct lack of qcf A
[3:55:22] <+VoidHaunter> @TopTieramisu Tell that to China
[3:55:24] <finalfantasyfan900> @toptieramisu yeah they just almost did it
[3:55:26] <RJroy0> @netorares I really hope Lucia gets a redemption
[3:55:28] <arkv01> @TopTieramisu they were getting there, ran into logistics problem during the war
[3:55:31] <%yuribo26> This game is very brown, white, black and red
[3:55:33] <%UrsulaCat> UNIFORM FETISH TIME
[3:55:39] <thesw1tch> imperial Japan did hella rapping and killing. they also raped a lot
[3:55:40] <TigerClaws12> @RoboBro1212 they did nazi "experiments" on the continent, so no shit LUL
[3:55:45] <%yuribo26> Notzis
[3:55:47] <Sebthemachinist> I like katana-guy. He's very methodical and meticulous in his playstyle.
[3:55:50] <%fatal_penguin_> It's funny that Imperial Japan during WWII was doing evil shit, but all they had to do was contact the West and be like "hey, we need to know medical stuff"
[3:55:51] <Charredasperity> Imperial japan did in fact do genocide, just not racial genocide
[3:55:52] <Zelretch3000> at least germany doesn't deny what happened during the nazi regime, japan tho...
[3:55:53] <N1netbattler> Did they play the pink hair girl?
[3:56:03] <+Netorares> @RJroy0 I hope she actually gets a small role in the story later on
[3:56:06] <%yuribo26> Why did Nazis had to ruin the looks NotLikeThis
[3:56:09] <Vashido22> Found some lore, Akatsuki was part of the japanese imperial army during world war 2, but disappeared only to re appear 50 years later with powers
[3:56:18] <Vashido22> so yeah, "not nazis"
[3:56:20] <%UrsulaCat> still evil
[3:56:22] <%yuribo26> @Zelretch3000 Japan be like SHOW THE RECEIPTS
[3:56:33] <supersanic94> whats this stoming dash
[3:56:33] <+VoidHaunter> This game is just a love letter to Hugo Boss
[3:56:36] <Zelretch3000> THAT AIN'T ME
[3:56:36] <%NumberTooBig> snazzy dressers, no
[3:56:37] <%fatal_penguin_> The War Crime Receipts
[3:56:40] <aiyobro> lol the u.s. fire bombed tokyo and nuked them twice after the gov't stpeed down
[3:56:40] <TigerClaws12> @yuribo26 LUL
[3:56:40] <supersanic94> whats this stompy dash
[3:56:42] <thesw1tch> @arkv01 mao... this man banned religion. I forgot about him. that's like the definition of evil, plus all the police state murder of his own citizens
[3:56:47] <+EastwindGuru> @VoidHaunter LMaoo
[3:56:49] <%yeknomlive> just found the new intro cause i came in late. it's too great
[3:56:59] <+TopTieramisu> the denialism of modern japan is frustrating, but it's actually not that uncommon among nations unfortunately
[3:57:02] <RJroy0> @yuribo26 I like Adolf was a normal name til Hitler ruined it
[3:57:15] <+TopTieramisu> i think germany's completely rebuke of its past actions is the exception, not the rule
[3:57:17] <+RoboBro1212> Hitler was also a pretty normal last name
[3:57:22] <konekoryugamine> I feel the key to making a good fighting game at this point is to make sure the buttons work in any number of variables.
[3:57:27] <+ChrisAlgoo> British empire, and then USAare both up there
[3:57:28] <%fatal_penguin_> Hitler's Mustache is still atrocious, though
[3:57:30] <konekoryugamine> Just, making sure everything can be interchanged
[3:57:31] <%yuribo26> @RJroy0 I was actually colleague with an Adolf on school, he was a dick
[3:57:37] <konekoryugamine> Like, adlibbing a solo in a musical act
[3:57:42] <Charredasperity> Charlie chaplin did the moustache better
[3:57:44] <+Netorares> Terra Formars made me love the name Adolf again
[3:57:46] <+RoboBro1212> Charlie Chaplin pulled off the mustache well
[3:57:54] <%fatal_penguin_> True
[3:57:59] <+TopTieramisu> he did it first, didn't he
[3:58:02] <aiyobro> as racist as the nazi's were, germans never owned slaves and everyone at that time hated gays
[3:58:10] <aiyobro> i mean black slaves lol
[3:58:11] <+RoboBro1212> Hitler just kinda looked like a huge dork
[3:58:17] <%fatal_penguin_> Yeah, they just killed them. lol
[3:58:21] <konekoryugamine> Does that tank have a fucking SKULL AT THE TOP?!
[3:58:26] <konekoryugamine> THAT'S METAL!
[3:58:26] <Sebthemachinist> TANK TIME
[3:58:30] <%yuribo26> @TopTieramisu dude, I was reading once about how some SCIENTISTS were plant "relics" on some archelogical sites to "prove" japanese people were on the islands before immigration from the mainland, to prove japanese were "pure", fucking hell
[3:58:35] <+VoidHaunter> Now we got a real match!
[3:58:36] <%NumberTooBig> we must all remember the one Key and peele sketch, "im just a big fan of chaplin"
[3:58:37] <+WizardofAahz> chat stop defending nazis, please
[3:58:38] <%fatal_penguin_> It's SKELLMO Tank
[3:58:41] <+EastwindGuru> Chat getting just edgy enough.
[3:58:41] <supersanic94> so we straight up fight a tank huh
[3:58:54] <aiyobro> 40% of hawaii was japanese
[3:59:04] <konekoryugamine> I wanna know if there's a fighting game character that can utilize a guitar
[3:59:04] <Charredasperity> little witch akatsuki
[3:59:05] <konekoryugamine> as a weapon
[3:59:08] <Zelretch3000> owning slaves, I guess being send to work in a concentration camp isn't slavery Kappa
[3:59:09] <N1netbattler> I feel like this tank belongs in another game
[3:59:13] <thesw1tch> @robobro1212 Hitler WAS a huge dork, he just was also an egomaniacal drug addict
[3:59:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:59:16] <TigerClaws12> the virgin loli zoner vs the chad BLITZTANK
[3:59:22] <+TopTieramisu> @yuribo26 yeah. that sounds pretty shitty
[3:59:22] <%NumberTooBig> at least i rhink its KnP
[3:59:25] <%yuribo26> @konekoryugamine I-nO and the zombie from Darkstalkers from the top of my mind
[3:59:25] <+VoidHaunter> @konekoryugamine I-No from Guilty Gear
[3:59:27] <+Schiz_Turtles> @konekoryugamine I-No from Guilty Gear
[3:59:28] <+RoboBro1212> @thesw1tch so Alex Jones with actual power
[3:59:31] <+RoboBro1212> Kappa
[3:59:33] <Quikanims> 4chan leaking into the chat
[3:59:33] <%fatal_penguin_> Hitler did drugs? lol
[3:59:34] <Kenny_Riot> Oh lord, it's BLITZTANK! The most Phallic fighting game character ever
[3:59:35] <+EastwindGuru> @konekoryugamine I-NO is who your looking for
[3:59:38] <thesw1tch> KappaRoss
[3:59:41] <aiyobro> i guess prison isn't slavery?
[3:59:46] <+TopTieramisu> undermining archaeology to further jingoistic claims
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <mr_miyagichu> @konekoryugamine yes check Dante in mvc and I-no in Guilty gear
[3:59:55] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> DrinkPurple
[4:00:00] <extradopeness> WTF is happening in this chat
[4:00:08] <TigerClaws12> @aiyobro yea that's what private US prisons say Kappa
[4:00:21] <%yuribo26> @TopTieramisu the worst part is that people who got a degree in some sort of sciente would commit such an act
[4:00:26] <aiyobro> koreans could be generals in the japanese army
[4:00:26] <mr_miyagichu> Also what’s up chat and woolz
[4:00:34] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> God i love blitztank's dumb design
[4:00:42] <+VoidHaunter> Clutch apatJpeg
[4:00:44] <%fatal_penguin_> We're talking about petitioning Woolie to rock the Hitler stache
[4:00:47] <extradopeness> We live in
[4:00:50] <+EastwindGuru> @konekoryugamine also, not the same exact thing, but in Rival Schools 2, a character fights using a viola/violin..she's good too.
[4:00:54] <N1netbattler> @extradopeness chat anwsering the same question the same way3 times in a row lol
[4:00:56] <+RoboBro1212> Blitztank is literally just a skull away from being cool
[4:00:57] <%NumberTooBig> its less a dp and more blanka shockinf
[4:01:00] <%yuribo26> @fatal_penguin_ LUL
[4:01:06] <+RoboBro1212> by which I mean a negative skull
[4:01:15] <+WizardofAahz> yeah he needs more skulls, I agree
[4:01:18] <%yeknomlive> like kanji's dp
[4:01:19] <%fatal_penguin_> Get 'em, Skellmo Tank
[4:01:26] <+TopTieramisu> @yuribo26 undermining science is particularly awful considering our current problem with fake news and anti-science movements
[4:01:31] <%alrobot2014> this is how i imagine mara would be implemented in p5a
[4:01:32] <Charredasperity> a few years ago the chat would be mocking the themes of the game, but now the chat is like "nazis had some good ideas also, I drink my own piss"
[4:01:39] <mr_miyagichu> @konekoryugamine I think lord raptor in dark stalkers also might use a guitar but that might just be an outro
[4:01:41] <thesw1tch> I agree with yall, not enough skulls on the tank
[4:01:47] <Skibopadoo> just tuning in, what the hell am i witnessing?
[4:01:50] <+RoboBro1212> how the fuck is the chat saying "the nazis had good ideas"
[4:01:53] <arkv01> you know some of these nazis are pretty h-h-hot
[4:01:55] <%fatal_penguin_> Are you saying Bear Grylls is a Nazi?
[4:01:55] <%yuribo26> @TopTieramisu oh god don't even get me started, like "scientists" defending how global warming is fake
[4:02:00] <aiyobro> jus saying the u.k.. sterilized alan turing in the 50's
[4:02:04] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> WHY NOT?
[4:02:09] <%yuribo26> @Skibopadoo some good ol nazi on nazi fighting
[4:02:09] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> IT LOOKS COOL SHUT UP
[4:02:15] <gryffinp> Why? FOR THE EMPEROR!
[4:02:16] <tacostarvedbeast> No nun love
[4:02:22] <Laironx3> cuz cool stfu Woolz
[4:02:22] <nekodelic> @skibopadoo reenactment of the Nanjing Massacre, but in fighting game form
[4:02:25] <+Emperor_Bad> nazis put skulls on everything
[4:02:27] <supersanic94> CHECHECHECHECHESTO!!
[4:02:28] <+VoidHaunter> Woolie clearly does not understand 40K design aesthetics
[4:02:32] <Zelretch3000> nazi's uniform look cool af, thats the only thing I'll ever give them
[4:02:32] <+FOGSHIE> My fav nazi fighter finally getting the love it deserves
[4:02:33] <%yuribo26> Why does everyone has Urien projectile?
[4:02:34] <SleepyMaribo> @RoboBro1212 the nazi's may have been absolute scum, but their experimentaion in the medical field spear headed modern medicine 10 years.
[4:02:36] <+LogothX> Is this Mugen?
[4:02:39] <+TopTieramisu> @yuribo26 the american president argues against climate change because it's cold on some days. the world is in bad shape
[4:02:41] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Say what you will but nazi had that super villain style
[4:02:42] <%UrsulaCat> @Emperor_Bad do you think they're the baddies?
[4:02:45] <%yuribo26> @LogothX nope, legit fighting game
[4:02:55] <Skibopadoo> @yuribo26 @nekodelic well shit, sign me up for that
[4:03:00] <Charredasperity> Is a tank still a tank without a canon?
[4:03:01] <finalfantasyfan900> The skull was doing his best quan chi cosplay off him
[4:03:01] <%yuribo26> @TopTieramisu didn't you hear, it was snowing yesterday doe LUL
[4:03:04] <+RoboBro1212> @SleepyMaribo I guess that's my point, nobody's sympathizing with the nazis, it's just little matter-of-fact things
[4:03:09] <+RoboBro1212> morality ain't black and white
[4:03:12] <+cafefunk> Life is short, cherish the ones you love, we all go back in the ground one day ;p
[4:03:15] <nekodelic> @lordspooklekins that's because Hugo Boss made their uniforms
[4:03:32] <%fatal_penguin_> Hugo Weaving? Red Skull?
[4:03:33] <thesw1tch> @sleepymaribo let's not forget if the nazis didnt develop rockets to kill even more people quicker, space exploration would have been set back 20 years or more
[4:03:44] <nekodelic> @robobro1212 mass genocide based on racism and bigotry is
[4:03:50] <+WizardofAahz> I can't believe there have been not one but mutliple "the nazis may have been bad, but..." tonight
[4:03:52] <+VoidHaunter> Like I said, this game is just a love letter to Hugo Boss
[4:03:58] <+RoboBro1212> @nekodelic yeah no shit sherlock
[4:04:11] <aiyobro> post mortem examinations on concentration camp prisoners discovered Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome
[4:04:14] <arkv01> is this jsut fucking saltybet
[4:04:14] <%yuribo26> I wouldn't fuck a pokemon, BUT
[4:04:15] <+EastwindGuru> Guys, are we really going "aye man, them Nazis were wild but i mean.....space travel and NATO are cool right?" are we doing that?
[4:04:17] <thesw1tch> @nekodelic depends on who you're racist against. fuck celestials KappaRoss
[4:04:20] <Fluke_M> Are we really doing this, chat?
[4:04:31] <arkv01> this is the most saltybet ass character I've seen in a real game
[4:04:34] <%fatal_penguin_> This is the timeline, chat
[4:04:35] <+ChrisAlgoo> Probably not a good idea to seek nuance in a convo about literal nazis. People can be monsters
[4:04:37] <SleepyMaribo> @WizardofAahz its a weird topic, they were shit, but if it werent for the fact that they were shit and we had to go over there and tell them not to be shit anymore, theres no telling how far behind we would be in many things
[4:04:45] <Zelretch3000> the nazis may have been bad, but we got blitztank because of them
[4:04:46] <+TopTieramisu> i would easily trade a bit of advancement in space travel for the lives lost senselessly by the nazis
[4:04:47] <+EastwindGuru> @yuribo26 literally the chat lmao
[4:05:00] <+VoidHaunter> @arkv01 Where do you think salty bet gets them from?
[4:05:02] <%fatal_penguin_> This game literally exists because of Nazis. lol
[4:05:03] <+WizardofAahz> It keeps happening
[4:05:09] <+RoboBro1212> "quick someone's having a sensible conversation about WWII history, better let 'em know how evil the nazis obviously are"
[4:05:09] <SleepyMaribo> im just saying lol
[4:05:10] <aiyobro> lol their rockets were fueld by juden
[4:05:11] <Charredasperity> hugo boss continuuing into modern day is so weird, imagine if like Nike designed for fascists, thats pretty much how it be
[4:05:15] <extradopeness> Aw fuck i have a Hugo Boss tee guess its time to burn it lol
[4:05:16] <arkv01> B L I T Z T A N K
[4:05:27] <Suwaiya> b tatsu wouldn't have existed without nazis
[4:05:39] <Suwaiya> therefore the nazis are bad
[4:05:39] <+ChrisAlgoo> like, if you want to say something like "nazis were bad, but" you can just stop there! you don't have to finish that sentence
[4:05:46] <+WizardofAahz> ^
[4:05:48] <Zelretch3000> oh yeah, Stroheim existe because of nazi's...
[4:05:54] <SleepyMaribo> so facts dont matter? ok.
[4:06:05] <nekodelic> @chrisalgoo basically this
[4:06:06] <aiyobro> that's not the point every one was racist at that time to each other
[4:06:12] <thesw1tch> might as well add this random shit, Bush's grandfather and great grandfather, respectively, laundered money for the nazis
[4:06:15] <Charredasperity> well robobro, Idk if you've been on twitter lately, but there's some people who forgot the obvious fact of "nazis are bad" I know I've had to block like 40 of them
[4:06:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:06:24] <%UrsulaCat> are we the baddies?
[4:06:32] <Fluke_M> Reminder that you're having this conversation while a giant tank with a skull on top is on the screen.
[4:06:32] <+TopTieramisu> if you're using that claim to defend nazis, you should rethink your gameplan
[4:06:34] <thesw1tch> !MOTIVATED
[4:06:34] <@Moobot> 144 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:06:35] <Laironx3> Very Nazties
[4:06:37] <%QueequegTheater> GOt banned from Pat's chat again
[4:06:39] <%QueequegTheater> what up
[4:06:40] <Charredasperity> The Bush family isn't exactly liked
[4:06:42] <+cafefunk> This convo started off as a joke about this game and has gotten a little too in depth for a game with laser skull tank
[4:06:43] <%yuribo26> Can we just go back to memeing about the game BibleThump
[4:06:44] <+VoidHaunter> Blitztank is just a Warhammer guest character
[4:06:48] <stormhawk9891> I noticed this during the Rising Thunder stream and even more so now, but Reggie doesn't really use tatsus all that much does he
[4:06:51] <TigerClaws12> corners PogChamp
[4:06:51] <thesw1tch> @queequegtheater we talking about nazies
[4:06:54] <%UrsulaCat> @QueequegTheater stop breaking the rules
[4:06:55] <Sebthemachinist> That was freakin' cool looking.
[4:06:58] <Shindeil> @QueequegTheater I was just there. What happened?
[4:06:59] <N1netbattler> what does MOTIVATED do?
[4:07:00] <+ChrisAlgoo> I'm glad that some of y'all are all for telling nazis to fuck off tho, bless you
[4:07:02] <%QueequegTheater> @UrsulaCat NO
[4:07:03] <arkv01> do you guys think the devs for this game are hardcore saltybet addicts
[4:07:05] <+Cafe_Spider> 'oh hey woolie's streaming, what's he playing? Oh....oh'
[4:07:12] <%yuribo26> @N1netbattler makes Vergil get bigger
[4:07:12] <%QueequegTheater> I will not be cowed by Moobot
[4:07:21] <D3rrtyD4n> zekeOH zekeNO
[4:07:24] <Charredasperity> I think this predates saltybet
[4:07:24] <SleepyMaribo> @TopTieramisu whose defending them, im simply stating that their technoligy helped spearhead world foward, yes, they are complete scumbags. but your feelings dont stop facts from being facts im sorry. but we have a thing called history
[4:07:25] <+Implosivestar> lol I just came from mugen stream and thought I was still there because skull tank
[4:07:28] <$KnivesEve> oh YES
[4:07:29] <+VoidHaunter> This came out in 07, way before salty bet
[4:07:38] <+WizardofAahz> "This combo only works in the corner and also on giant tanks with skull heads"
[4:07:40] <%fatal_penguin_> Can we switch this conversation to a respectable topic, Chat, like how good Q-Tips feel in the ear?
[4:07:50] <+TopTieramisu> my feelings? wtf is your point in the first place?
[4:07:58] <%QueequegTheater> Nazis are basically just ripoffs of the Belkans
[4:07:58] <%yuribo26> @fatal_penguin_ literally my addiction FeelsBadMan
[4:08:00] <Charredasperity> You're not supposed to insert q tips all the way into your ear, it says so on the box
[4:08:04] <+VoidHaunter> Salty Bet wouldn't exist without out boy, Blitztank
[4:08:04] <N1netbattler> @yuribo26 Where is the Vergil in question?
[4:08:07] <Smart_ZaK1> Do you think Nazis had an effect on the development of the modern Q tip?
[4:08:09] <aiyobro> yeah all of the axis had twice the literacy rate than russia and china, they're werent dumb
[4:08:10] <thesw1tch> @fatal_penguin_ nazis had qtips probably
[4:08:11] <Shindeil> Marilyn Sue looking good.
[4:08:11] <+cafefunk> If we are gonna talk, lets talk about pie vs cake. I really cant decide between cherry pie and carrot cake
[4:08:12] <mutmc> BibleThump
[4:08:13] <%QueequegTheater> Yes
[4:08:14] <%fatal_penguin_> @yuribo26 It feels so good though!
[4:08:15] <arkv01> my god these nazi waifus
[4:08:15] <+TopTieramisu> that the nazis were necessary for human development or something? because the advancements would have happened with or without the nazis
[4:08:15] <Nehson> pepeD

[4:08:30] <%yuribo26> @N1netbattler "NOW IM MOTIVATED" is a famous voice line from Vergil
[4:08:32] <%yeknomlive> blitztank vs whale let's go
[4:08:38] <Shindeil> !MOTIVATED
[4:08:38] <@Moobot> 145 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:08:39] <SleepyMaribo> oh its my girl Anonym!
[4:08:44] <+Dovakhin573> Cant wait for Jojos Heritage for the future night
[4:08:45] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Only Dio can kill Killer Whale.
[4:08:46] <SleepyMaribo> get her lvl 3 super
[4:09:02] <%yuribo26> Why do guns and nuns go so well together?
[4:09:03] <%yeknomlive> god i was there for that dio vs whale fight. i got literally 1mil off that bet
[4:09:04] <arkv01> povery games never cease to amaze me
[4:09:05] <+VoidHaunter> Nuns are pretty cool, but give them a gun and they get cool as shit
[4:09:20] <SleepyMaribo> @yeknomlive how did dio beat killer whale?
[4:09:23] <%fatal_penguin_> I have Tinnitus from chronic ear aches as a kid, so I ain't hurting my ears any more than they already are. Plus, I don't go in that far.
[4:09:34] <Cypherblack> sion in unist is good
[4:09:34] <%yeknomlive> @SleepyMaribo he would glitch out of the world and timer scam
[4:09:42] <thesw1tch> let's not forget nazis did help save the world from Egyptian gods. yeah, they neutralized some children, but let's not forget
[4:09:44] <+cafefunk> I think theyre doing that gun system with Sharon in FEXL
[4:09:51] <castcode> The Church of Equilibrium

[4:10:06] <Rex_Prime> did woolie see the new dmc5 music vid
[4:10:09] <Shindeil> MAN THIS FIGHTING GAME SURE FIGHTS
[4:10:10] <%fatal_penguin_> Also, wtf is this game. Nazi's and Nuns?
[4:10:11] <aiyobro> all i said was eastern europe didn't have slave and colonies lol
[4:10:15] <Laironx3> There is even a nun with guns character in Wonderful 101: Wonder-Nun.
[4:10:23] <+TopTieramisu> @thesw1tch don't forget mayan vampires
[4:10:26] <Charredasperity> Bayonetta
[4:10:26] <+Dovakhin573> You know whats better than gun nuns? SEXY NUNS
[4:10:34] <%Skullgod> gun nuns are usually sexy nuns tho
[4:10:35] <Cypherblack> @fatal_penguin_ afraid of connecting to the SS NETWORK?!
[4:10:39] <nekodelic> @sleepymaribo dude, most of the technological and scientific advancements were not made because of the nazis, in fact, basically all of their experiments were made in unsanitary conditions based on eugenics pseudoscience, mostly for the sake of cruelty. but hey, keep believing the Shapiro/Peterson misinformed history, because actual facts say otherwise
[4:10:40] <+RelentlessEngima> Black Lagoon had a nun
[4:10:40] <%yeknomlive> she has high heels and guns
[4:10:41] <Brofarian> I feel like Ibuki has that problem in SFV, she has limited kunai but they aren't really good enough to justify having them be a limited resource, especially since they're not even as versatile as in 4 since you can't back jump and lame them out.
[4:10:52] <+VoidHaunter> Does she keep her bullets in her habit?
[4:10:54] <+TruSpindash> What anime
[4:10:54] <%UrsulaCat> peepee
[4:10:55] <mutmc> Kappa WutFace
[4:10:57] <Nillard> Grenadier!
[4:10:58] <%UrsulaCat> doodoo
[4:10:58] <+Willdog1993> But what about SEXY GUN NUNS?! @Dovakhin573
[4:10:59] <arkv01> hey man if a gun nun wants to be sexy stylish thats not a crime
[4:11:00] <+VektorTroika> GRENADIER
[4:11:02] <vextalyst> GRENADIER
[4:11:03] <Kenny_Riot> @Dovakhin573 You know what's worse? "Nude Nuns with Big Guns". Terrible movie.
[4:11:03] <gryffinp> Nothing will ever top the Grenadier reload
[4:11:06] <%fatal_penguin_> Is this The Nun movie game?
[4:11:10] <+Dovakhin573> EBEN BETTER
[4:11:13] <+WhyIDie> "she shakes her cleavage and X happens" describes a lot of anime
[4:11:18] <SleepyMaribo> @neko 1, done with the conversation, and 2 what does peterson and shaprio have to do with anything?
[4:11:21] <aiyobro> mengele had an entire town in argentina full of twins
[4:11:24] <thesw1tch> @toptieramisu the nazis weren't all bad. vampires are the real scum of the earth
[4:11:29] <+ChrisAlgoo> @nekodelic folks were even paraphrasing "facts don't care about your feelings" lollll
[4:11:36] <thesw1tch> KappaRoss
[4:11:47] <vextalyst> YOU DON"T GET a SMILE TODAY
[4:11:51] <Cypherblack> eltnum/sion in unist has a cool system for her gun
[4:11:58] <Sebthemachinist> I wonder if having projectiles in fighting games in general be a limited resource would fix the whole problem. If only Deathstroke needed to reload...
[4:12:01] <Charredasperity> I miss when twitch chats were all weed jokes
[4:12:11] <%UrsulaCat> @ChrisAlgoo I wasn't paying attention to chat, were they?
[4:12:17] <%yuribo26> RESSURECTION
[4:12:21] <TigerClaws12> LOL
[4:12:22] <gordieda20> LUL
[4:12:23] <+VoidHaunter> I think all gun characters should have an OTG shot like Adachi in P4A
[4:12:26] <%fatal_penguin_> You did it Nun, for Jesus
[4:12:26] <%NumberTooBig> @sebthemachinist then Ryu would be EVEN WORSE
[4:12:31] <+WhyIDie> @Sebthemachinist naoto in the persona FG had that
[4:12:34] <Djinnazz> Fuckin Gun cata Nun
[4:12:34] <Fluke_M> @Sebthemachinist That'd be counter productive, make better defensive options instead of gimping offensive options.
[4:12:36] <wolvenelf> lmao
[4:12:37] <Plague_Nurse> cheap
[4:12:37] <%UrsulaCat> you did it for nun, jesus
[4:12:38] <Cypherblack> she has like an active reload
[4:12:45] <nekodelic> God bless the nun
[4:12:46] <Djinnazz> AMEN Mother fuckers.
[4:12:46] <Cypherblack> reinforced bullets and shit
[4:12:51] <+TopTieramisu> the "i speak facts and you spew feels" definitely reeks of shapiroesque argumentation
[4:12:54] <%fatal_penguin_> Nun was the original Boondock Saint
[4:12:59] <%yuribo26> This dude doesn't fit in the game, lol
[4:13:00] <+cafefunk> Thats even more bullshit than Elena super
[4:13:04] <Charredasperity> the pope AND Ghandi believe it or not. Ghandhi actually did a fair share of fucked up stuff
[4:13:07] <SleepyMaribo> why give her a limited bullet supply if her guns are meh to begin with?
[4:13:09] <+VoidHaunter> That's just Shinsuke Nakamura. You can't fool me.
[4:13:09] <BananaBread101> Those jiggle physics
[4:13:14] <%yuribo26> Holy shit, this stage is AWFUL
[4:13:14] <thesw1tch> @charredasperity hey man, weed jokes are a joint effort. to be blunt, you need some jokes too
[4:13:14] <+ChrisAlgoo> @UrsulaCat a bit of a ways up! sentence rearranged but it had facts and feelings and juxtaposed them
[4:13:18] <%fatal_penguin_> Ghandi was a weirdo that slept with kids.
[4:13:18] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:13:23] <%UrsulaCat> HMMMM
[4:13:33] <Zelretch3000> Ghandi likes to nuke others
[4:13:33] <+ChrisAlgoo> smoke weed everyday. smoke weed smoke weed everyday
[4:13:36] <%yuribo26> Good ol' jpeg stage
[4:13:39] <+cafefunk> Ghandhi was also SUPER racist
[4:13:42] <aeon4249> Knowing Mussolini the Vatican barely had any choice though, hell he even kick out the mafia of Italy at the time.
[4:13:42] <D3rrtyD4n> atpSuspect
[4:13:43] <%UrsulaCat> SMONK
[4:13:46] <+WhyIDie> this looks like an early mugen stage
[4:13:46] <aiyobro> im seeing battle angel alita in a couple days thank god
[4:13:50] <%yuribo26> The colors are AWFUL, they blend in themselves
[4:13:54] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> I think it's supposed to look like No Man's Land.
[4:13:54] <%yeknomlive> move over pokefloats
[4:13:57] <Charredasperity> This fighting stage is just what Illinois looks like
[4:13:59] <%fatal_penguin_> @aiyobro I;m wondering is that movie is any good
[4:14:01] <gryffinp> I don't know, I've seen some REAL garbage stages on Saltybet
[4:14:08] <N1netbattler> show me a pretty war zone Woolie?
[4:14:09] <%BarryGibbz> its missing a jpeg dog
[4:14:10] <Sebthemachinist> Well, if a character's main playstyle is zoning, then maybe to make it fair, there should be at least some limit on it so that the likes of Deathstroke and Peacock don't happen. Men like Ryu who don't focus their style around projectile need not worry because it's not the mainstay of their style.
[4:14:16] <Tsantiago1> Are you going to play Darkest Dungeon 2 🤔
[4:14:18] <%NumberTooBig> Alita is a movie... thqts the highest praise i can give
[4:14:20] <aiyobro> @fatal_penguin_ it's ok, not as violent as the manga, probably not as dreamy either obv
[4:14:22] <%UrsulaCat> <3 <3 <3 WE LOVE WOOLIE <3 <3 <3
[4:14:24] <wolvenelf> hah
[4:14:26] <thesw1tch> @charredasperity this stage isnt flat enough to be Illinois, but it is boring enough
[4:14:33] <%yuribo26> Its brown and yellow training room
[4:14:34] <+VektorTroika> this is 2008
[4:14:35] <gordieda20> LUL
[4:14:35] <%yeknomlive> There was that amazing stage that has tetsuo popping in an out with a goofy face
[4:14:46] <vextalyst> @WoolieVersus Im angry you didn't include DOA stages in your best stages vid
[4:14:50] <Cypherblack> not true, the 3rd to the bottom grain of grass shows that this is not only a time of sorrow, but of war
[4:14:50] <+JacktheMan18> when is french bread going to remake Akatsuki Blitzkampf tho?
[4:14:59] <Zelretch3000> after melty blood
[4:15:06] <%fatal_penguin_> My social reactions thus far to Alita is that outside the theatre in my city, the Alita movie tickets cover the ground outsie
[4:15:07] <+TopTieramisu> hollywood is bound to get an anime adaptation right one day, right?
[4:15:07] <+VoidHaunter> After UNISTR
[4:15:10] <+TopTieramisu> right guys?
[4:15:11] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus I love baby woolie in the fighterpedia video
[4:15:23] <%NumberTooBig> when is french bread gonna do a new thing
[4:15:24] <%UrsulaCat> Top tier you're a funny guy
[4:15:28] <Charredasperity> @Sebthemachinist Peacock and deathstroke are fair in their respective games because of the tools given to the other characters and a general lack of melee
[4:15:34] <%yuribo26> Alita was great don't @ me
[4:15:40] <aiyobro> hollywood is Tokyo Godfathers basically
[4:15:41] <nekodelic> @sebthemachinist the fact that SF projectiles clash with each other and have a relatively slow speed compared to, for example, Injustice 2, makes a whole lot of difference
[4:15:43] <%NumberTooBig> @yuribo26 @
[4:15:48] <SleepyMaribo> excuse me with that combo?
[4:15:48] <%yuribo26> @NumberTooBig how dare you
[4:15:49] <Sebthemachinist> @TopTieramisu Well, I did hear that the Alita movie isn't horrid. In fact, it's quite decent. A 7 or 8 outta 10.
[4:15:55] <%fatal_penguin_> I'll stick to my Studio Gibli movies, I;m fine with that
[4:16:07] <+VoidHaunter> That throw rivals Merkava's
[4:16:10] <+TopTieramisu> i've definitely heard varying opinions on alita
[4:16:11] <+WhyIDie> love how wing chun has so many slaps
[4:16:13] <thesw1tch> @toptieramisu depends on if you consider scott pilgrim an anime
[4:16:14] <arkv01> oh my god this choco color
[4:16:21] <Brofarian> I'm surprised there are dark skinned alts in this game
[4:16:28] <gryffinp> The reception of alita seems pretty good, which is almost unfortunate if it means that more movies are going to do things like the face thing
[4:16:32] <+TopTieramisu> scott pilgrim is as anime as pepper ann
[4:16:36] <Fluke_M> You can make your own color palette
[4:16:38] <SleepyMaribo> @VoidHaunter can any throw really truly rival merkava?
[4:16:46] <%yeknomlive> is she lame is she cool?
[4:16:49] <%UrsulaCat> pepper ann is super anime fuck you
[4:16:50] <aiyobro> nah alita is a robot
[4:16:50] <+EastwindGuru> Alita is pretty good but its has its share of problems.
[4:16:56] <%fatal_penguin_> Hanz Landa
[4:16:57] <%NumberTooBig> how to draw manga, remastered in IMAX 3d
[4:17:01] <Plague_Nurse> Alitalia is great, but the MC's face felt so out of place and uncanny as hell
[4:17:02] <nekodelic> @gryffinp I REALLY hope Hollywood is not that dumb
[4:17:09] <Plague_Nurse> *alita
[4:17:12] <+VoidHaunter> @SleepyMaribo It's all about how much brain damage a throw can give a child, really
[4:17:20] <Brofarian> Chocolate Nazis are also a race that only exists in anime
[4:17:21] <TigerClaws12> excuse me?
[4:17:26] <%yuribo26> @Brofarian lul
[4:17:27] <arkv01> @gryffinp bit of a jump, camerons just a fucking weirdo methinks
[4:17:27] <SleepyMaribo> THAT DAMAGE!!!
[4:17:34] <TigerClaws12> that's OD
[4:17:38] <+TopTieramisu> @UrsulaCat ah, but the catch 22 is, if pepper ann is anime, then it wasn't an insult, was it?
[4:17:42] <+EastwindGuru> I didn't think the eye thing was all that bad as you don't really notice it after the first 5 mins but it sets up for a sequel that we may not ever get.
[4:18:03] <+VoidHaunter> Pepper Ann is an anime
[4:18:04] <%UrsulaCat> @TopTieramisu don't drag down pepper ann by comparing it to scott pilgrim
[4:18:04] <Sebthemachinist> Alita's face doesn't bother me, as it's actually played out as an element of her character. She's supposed to look creepy and weird because she's a Literal Android.
[4:18:13] <%yuribo26> @EastwindGuru we can always just read the manga
[4:18:18] <%NumberTooBig> we can all agree, keep hollywood the fuck away from anine
[4:18:21] <Brofarian> That's the kind of damage that makes you go: "wow, that's a lot of damage"
[4:18:22] <aiyobro> there's an anime too
[4:18:24] <+peri_d0t> i love the eyes
[4:18:27] <%NumberTooBig> anime, christ
[4:18:28] <+TopTieramisu> ah, the mixup
[4:18:30] <%fatal_penguin_> Can Alita also double as a creepy sex robot?
[4:18:34] <+EastwindGuru> @yuribo26 Yeah I've decided to do that soon.
[4:18:38] <+VoidHaunter> Keep Hollywood away from Pepper Ann!
[4:18:44] <aiyobro> No that's super illegal in america
[4:18:45] <gryffinp> Can we average out alita's eyes and will smith genie's eyes
[4:18:45] <thesw1tch> I would love to do a monster noir film
[4:18:49] <TigerClaws12> @Sebthemachinist cyborg, ree
[4:18:49] <+WhyIDie> woolie gonna start showing up in posts in the nazier sides of reddit LUL
[4:18:49] <nekodelic> @fatal_penguin_ everything can, if you're brave enough
[4:18:54] <SleepyMaribo> honestly, nothing tops the absurdity that the castlevania fighting game can get to, yall seen those infinites?
[4:19:12] <%fatal_penguin_> Ooohh Aladdin looks so baadddd. Whhhyyy
[4:19:13] <+TopTieramisu> i abhor the castlevania fighting game's redesigns
[4:19:13] <%yeknomlive> man i'd love a legit castlevania fighting game
[4:19:14] <%yuribo26> @EastwindGuru my face when I discover the manga is still going and has 3 different releases across 30 volumes of manga Jebaited
[4:19:16] <Sebthemachinist> @NumberTooBig Ain't nothing wrong with live-action anime movies being made. The problem comes from live-action anima movies being made In Hollywood. lytFILTH
[4:19:22] <nekodelic> @sleepymaribo hokuto no ken is also a gem in that aspect
[4:19:24] <%UrsulaCat> I like the skirt over pants look pepper ann had
[4:19:32] <+EastwindGuru> @yuribo26 WutFace WutFace WutFace
[4:19:52] <Fluke_M> Reminder that this game has an open and welcoming community that does not condone the few 'nicknames' this game received over the years.
[4:19:58] <aiyobro> i just got a box set of GitS and Nausicaa, already had Akira
[4:19:58] <%NumberTooBig> @sebthemachinist thats... whqt i said
[4:20:03] <%yuribo26> @Fluke_M nicknames?

[4:20:37] <Sebthemachinist> Ah, sorry. New here. lytWORRY
[4:20:45] <Brofarian> @Fluke_M I mean, I feel like if you're playing a Nazi based fighting game you may as well commit to the bit
[4:20:51] <Fuji_Apples> @UrsulaCat but this game is awesome
[4:20:51] <gryffinp> Are any of the playable characters Jewish?
[4:20:52] <%NumberTooBig> @ursulacat like fortnite Kappa
[4:20:53] <Fluke_M> No, don't do that.
[4:20:57] <+TopTieramisu> well. korea makes great movies
[4:20:59] <nekodelic> Darkester Dungeon
[4:21:08] <aiyobro> it's weird reading GitS when your older, you realize that person animating it maybe bullshiting quite a bit lol
[4:21:22] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Wooolie! Darkest Dungeon 2 was just announced!
[4:21:25] <%UrsulaCat> there are better fighting games than this

[4:22:11] <+MightyMaxT> I did not know that this was the same Akatsuki in UNIST. It is so obvious now that I know
[4:22:16] <+TruSpindash> 6th Fate is Akatsuki Blizkampf
[4:22:17] <Brofarian> Is it possible to rename him Sheer Heart-a-Tank?
[4:22:20] <+MightyMaxT> I feel big dumb
[4:22:27] <thesw1tch> Woolie 2019 - "subscribe to that nazi newsletter"

[4:23:07] <+TopTieramisu> negan vs tank. the ultimate dream match
[4:23:08] <Fluke_M> The game is fine and solid as it is, the players who like it don't need schmucks snickering about the subject matter.
