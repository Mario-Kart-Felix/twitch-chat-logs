[0:04:43] <@akuda_bar> disco elysium is amazeballs
[0:04:54] <%kinetikpaws> thats on my wishlist
[0:04:57] <Iwashi94> it's like 20 hours
[0:04:58] <%gatorafan> I'm super hyped for PSO2 2
[0:05:04] <%kyh9> It has some fantastic moments
[0:05:06] <+Creggamonsta> same woolie.
[0:05:08] <brian_peppers1> @chosenjuan42 Can't hear you take those burgers outta your filthy mouth!
[0:05:10] <penitentpentwitch> It's a good game, but GOD is it antithesis of a streaming game.
[0:05:10] <@akuda_bar> it's 20-30, yeah, but it begs for replay. it's also not fun to stream it though.
[0:05:15] <%kyh9> Not really streamable
[0:05:16] <%Irridium> Honestly it would be best to play it on your own
[0:05:19] <pory_z> just play it on your own
[0:05:19] <+thackattack00> just play it for yourself man
[0:05:20] <%Exiliator> Fuck yes it is
[0:05:20] <%kyh9> The Anti-Stream game
[0:05:22] <%relentingapunch> Not really a streamable game
[0:05:29] <Drusain> Kinda the same problem with Planescape Torment
[0:05:29] <@akuda_bar> it's definitely not a stream. but it's fun.
[0:05:30] <+Creggamonsta> Day9 is playing it
[0:05:34] <+Creggamonsta> its goina pretty good
[0:05:34] <Ashenik1> Woolie witcher 3 is a better game to lets play :>
[0:05:35] <%relentingapunch> It is anti-stream, moreso than Danganronpa
[0:05:36] <penitentpentwitch> Play it offscreen, along with watching Korra
[0:05:37] <%Exiliator> Your idea of lets plays is ancient old man!
[0:05:39] <cosmicgoatee> announcing the new fable was pretty neato
[0:05:43] <+gus_hornblende> It has partial voice acting, but yeah it is a lot of reading
[0:05:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Text to speech Jebaited
[0:05:47] <%saraizarai> Wasn't disco voiced?
[0:05:48] <%kyh9> Voice acting is expensive, and they're just 8 Estonian commies
[0:05:51] <+Zutrax> Game has voice acting during main story bits I think. But yeah mostly reading
[0:05:55] <%relentingapunch> DA aint voiced
[0:05:57] <+DukeBlack_> Ad lib
[0:05:58] <%kyh9> @saraizarai Only partially
[0:06:00] <Drusain> It has SOME voice activing
[0:06:00] <%ringabal> Maxed out Exposition build. Let's go.
[0:06:02] <@akuda_bar> @saraizarai only 10% of the lines
[0:06:06] <+linSP> Disco is kinda voiced
[0:06:11] <brian_peppers1> Woolie will love The Witcher 3 but he will NEVER play it.
[0:06:11] <penitentpentwitch> It'd cost WAY TOO MUCH if there was voice acting
[0:06:13] <%LastHazzerd> oh this is not on the devs at all.
[0:06:17] <%kyh9> Original Sin 2 got fully voiced as a stretch goal
[0:06:24] <+gus_hornblende> Reggie's reactions to some of those moments would be gold
[0:06:25] <JetpackMcQuack> AI voice actors are on the horizon btw
[0:06:28] <LBC921> I see woolie got into the saints
[0:06:35] <%LastHazzerd> It is not a video game dev's responsibility to make things easy for LPers
[0:06:35] <hassanico2> Hey chat, just came in, what game?
[0:06:36] <@akuda_bar> ancient reptile brain has the best fucking voice
[0:06:40] <derap41> man Reggie why you not color coding ?
[0:06:45] <hassanico2> oooh, Disco?
[0:06:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I like it but it uses too many big words for me
[0:07:00] <%saraizarai> Huh, gotcha
[0:07:01] <%chosenjuan42> woolieKICKDAD woolieVS woolieOMG
[0:07:01] <@akuda_bar> yeah. i just wouldn't recommend even trying it but that's just me
[0:07:09] <irregularly_irregular> Did Woolie watch the Xbox conference... thing?
[0:07:11] <+Creggamonsta> ill read it for you. fuck it
[0:07:11] <hassanico2> Disco is VN tier which is SUPER dangerous for LP videos LUL
[0:07:19] <pory_z> i think you can adjust the text size
[0:07:20] <brian_peppers1> Wait for the iPAD version
[0:07:20] <%Irridium> Could y'all imagine the backseating on a Disco LP LUL
[0:07:23] <@akuda_bar> it's very much not even a game you wanna play with someone else around, it's aggressively singleplayer
[0:07:28] <Ashenik1> Woolie witcher 3 maybe then ???
[0:07:33] <%Exiliator> People already do that, so
[0:07:42] <+Ryu_R> @hassanico2 a VN without anime is double dangerous for LPs
[0:07:43] <hassanico2> @Irridium entire chat is cop brain
[0:07:44] <+linSP> it’s a fun story game
[0:07:44] <+Miles_Hikari> nicobThink
[0:07:55] <penitentpentwitch> You'd need Minh and Reggie to help with voices, and even THAT is a stretch.
[0:08:09] <+DarkestVegemite> Text-to-speech!
[0:08:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Ashenik1 Thats an 80 hour+ game. It's take Woolie over a year
[0:08:11] <%BisoromiBear> hire 10 bums
[0:08:13] <%relentingapunch> Getting both Minh and Reggie to help would still be a LOT
[0:08:19] <+Creggamonsta> just play it and talk about it on the podcasts
[0:08:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Hire voice actors
[0:08:27] <Ashenik1> @BallerSwagBro9k and....? Kappa
[0:08:30] <%kyh9> BALAN WONDERLAND, HOW DID MICROSOFT NOT HIGHLIGHT THIS MORE?!

[0:08:49] <@akuda_bar> @kyh9 wait is it wonderworld or wonderland, i feel like i'm being gaslit
[0:08:51] <%exnuart> halo infinite looking like hot garbage
[0:08:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Fun fact most of Halo's plot is based on the book of Daniel
[0:08:56] <Drusain> The H in Halo stands for Halo
[0:08:59] <Esparsenior> Am I going crazy but I’m 99% sure Disco Elysium has voice acting
[0:09:01] <%ringabal> You dare besmirch the word of our lord Jimmy Halo!?
[0:09:02] <DeepSearch27> When will Woolie play "Bible: 3" or "Bible: ODST"
[0:09:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Look it up on the wiki
[0:09:03] <%relentingapunch> evo15MindBlown
[0:09:04] <%saraizarai> Disco isn't "that" long, steam says I beat it in 22hrs
[0:09:10] <@akuda_bar> @Esparsenior it only has 10% voice acting
[0:09:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Cant escape GOD
[0:09:13] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> The L in Halo stand s for Leviticus

[0:13:04] <skyheys> ruiner is a good game thi
[0:13:18] <%MacabreOpus> Joined late, has Woolie seen Halo Infinite yet
[0:13:25] <BlackermanZX> The Halo Infinite gameplay they showed today looked cool
[0:13:27] <DeepSearch27> Free to play 30% off
[0:13:36] <%MyBulletsLAG> Final boss of the Halo franchise will be the nutjob that wrote Book of Leviticus

[0:14:09] <HereComestheChief> Master Chief will punch Judas in the face
[0:14:16] <%MacabreOpus> Exomecha looks rad
[0:14:17] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Primarina tho
[0:14:22] <penitentpentwitch> I liked Blastoise the most of the initial three starter evolutions. Mostly because it was the most unique looking.
[0:14:24] <cosmicgoatee> Squirtle Squad
[0:14:29] <missingangle> Blastoise is fucking rad
[0:14:31] <%relentingapunch> Squirtle Squad ALL DAY
[0:14:39] <@Solidus_113> And nobody wanted the plant
[0:14:42] <%LastHazzerd> is that why Blue was the one in america?
[0:14:43] <Drusain> I like Wartortle because he reminds me a valkyrie from VP
[0:14:43] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Blastoise is so dumb
[0:14:46] <+RyTYoung> Squirtle is the best looking starter
[0:14:48] <pory_z> i wanted the plant ;_;
[0:14:48] <cosmicgoatee> I Stanstoised
[0:14:52] <skyheys> Charizard is for simple bitches
[0:14:54] <BlackermanZX> Blaziken and Infernape sold me
[0:14:54] <%jiggy_snipe> does Woolie like Digimon Kappa?
[0:14:56] <%DrDestro> sorry but inteleon snipes blastoides
[0:15:01] <cosmicgoatee> Wartortle was super cool too
[0:15:06] <+RyTYoung> Digimon are RAD
[0:15:10] <HereComestheChief> ItsHappening
[0:15:10] <Hyper_charger> vinesaur where its at
[0:15:17] <%kyh9> Singleplayer should double as tutorials
[0:15:17] <+inkthepeasant> come to the Milwaukee FGC scene
[0:15:26] <+inkthepeasant> weirdly somewhat active Tekken scene
[0:15:29] <%kyh9> The Single Player should teach the players the higher-level tactics
[0:15:29] <%DrDestro> digiwho?
[0:15:30] <%andrex2311> Granblue single player is fun
[0:15:32] <Hyper_charger> MK is the best example
[0:15:33] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> MK9 was fun
[0:15:34] <missingangle> A lot of people don't want JUST a fighting game
[0:15:38] <cosmicgoatee> @rytyoung the new 2020 digimon anime is pretty good
[0:15:39] <notsoy> i mean, mortal kombat and injustice do their single-player stuff very well and make TONS of money
[0:15:41] <@Solidus_113> Fighting Herds!
[0:15:42] <+UberWolfman> SFV LUL
[0:15:50] <Iam_Dead> God the p4A and p4AU challenge modes suck
[0:15:51] <%TheLemuroid> Imagine bad single player AND bad netcode
[0:15:53] <%HollowedIdjit> a single player mode should teach you something as well sa the story
[0:15:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MK 9-11 story is great dumb fun
[0:15:59] <+RyTYoung> @cosmicgoatee yeah I've been keeping up with it, it's a nice spin on the original anime
[0:16:02] <%SomersaultJustice> for a long time I've wanted a sequel to Red Earth for this reason, with customizable moves and leveling
[0:16:10] <irregularly_irregular> I don't have the time to "get gud" at fighting games but I enjoy them nonetheless... so the single-player mode they did in Granblue was dope
[0:16:11] <%andrex2311> Granblue being a beaten-up is the best to me
[0:16:13] <%Irridium> I'm honestly fine with just an arcade mode with a little ending for each character.
[0:16:14] <%jinking79> reason y SFV sucked
[0:16:46] <GenericSoda> tekken bowl
[0:16:48] <hassanico2> I like SWR's Story Mode :)
[0:16:59] <%relentingapunch> Golden Arena was a great mode that wasn't as fleshed out as it could be
[0:17:09] <%relentingapunch> Love the idea of leveling up and gaining skills
[0:17:11] <%HollowedIdjit> BlazBlue used to have a ton of Single Player content
[0:18:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It sound quiet for anyone else or just me?
[0:18:09] <%relentingapunch> Fine for me
[0:18:21] <cosmicgoatee> @canadiananimatorguy they're pretty good volume wise
[0:18:22] <%Javaa01> If RTS hadn't learned from eachother, it would have died before it even got started
[0:18:25] <%Exiliator> yeah, allll those kart-racing games Kappa
[0:18:27] <%Irridium> LUL
[0:18:29] <Prevot> they still havent even learned rollback from each other
[0:18:30] <derap41> Time To rewatch Chernobyl too
[0:18:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Aight, thanks bros.
[0:18:35] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> wow, I haven't heard that name in years

[0:18:54] <Apple_Tuna> stalker was already copyrighted so they did this
[0:18:59] <Kei_Ar_> E's Laf is kinda learning off of other fighting games with the various mechanics per character and custom palletes
[0:19:00] <%Irridium> oh I'm sure he tried his best
[0:19:00] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> vineNut
[0:19:00] <savetitania> testing stalker sounds like a fucking experience
[0:19:07] <hassanico2> Yuji Naka made NiGHTS, AGAIN LUL
[0:19:13] <BlackermanZX> fucking PSO2 New Genesis tho
[0:19:18] <GenericSoda> get out of here stalker

[0:19:24] <+OroOreo> Ek bok
[0:19:25] <+GreenCMD> I'm so mad the Tetris effect update is timed exclusive
[0:19:31] <irregularly_irregular> Nah I think it's pretty honest. You had a hard stance on that.
[0:19:33] <derap41> The Hardest doesn't ruin it but its not how its meant to be played
[0:19:38] <Drusain> Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix
[0:19:39] <savetitania> mgr revengeance
[0:19:39] <+bokutachi_san> Stalker's highest difficulty
[0:19:50] <pixel_river> Phantasy star was there, looked cool
[0:19:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[0:19:56] <irregularly_irregular> it ruins blind LPs is what you were saying.
[0:19:59] <%Javaa01> Stalker's hardest difficulty is the intended difficulty
[0:20:04] <+RyTYoung> yeyeyeye
[0:20:09] <penitentpentwitch> NO. Do NOT put Woolie through Legendary.
[0:20:11] <+Ryu_R> the game is built around heroic
[0:20:13] <+CptBritches> Woolie's done for
[0:20:14] <%relentingapunch> LASO is for people who lenjoy Halo
[0:20:14] <+Creggamonsta> super hard mode ant good for streams
[0:20:16] <BlackermanZX> doodWAT
[0:20:16] <%Javaa01> Everything under Master in Stalker actively makes the gameplay worse
[0:20:17] <+UberWolfman> Alatreon broke the MHW LUL
[0:20:18] <%Chatterbox1991> RONA
[0:20:21] <+Superbro64> rona monkaS
[0:20:21] <@Solidus_113> STALKER has fucked up difficulty settings, where easier makes both you and your enemies do less damage
[0:20:27] <skyheys> SHOOK at the thought of Legendary
[0:20:28] <%relentingapunch> Even just Legendary is rough in certain halo games
[0:20:31] <cosmicgoatee> you don't want pain and suffering understandable
[0:20:31] <DeepSearch27> Legendary is killing Woolie BEFORE touching him
[0:20:32] <%Exiliator> Sure it ruins LP's, but it makes for fun streaming
[0:20:37] <%NottaAlotta> ITS DA RONA
[0:20:38] <savetitania> @Solidus_113 so mgr but backwards??
[0:20:39] <penitentpentwitch> Heroic is a good balance of progress and difficulty
[0:20:41] <%relentingapunch> In Reach Legendary is ROUGH
[0:20:43] <cosmicgoatee> especially for an LP
[0:20:44] <%SomersaultJustice> unless you're max Kappa
[0:20:46] <FazzleRazzle> its not rona chat, hes not in America LUL
[0:20:47] <Apple_Tuna> In stalker hardest difficulty is easier in some aspects
[0:20:52] <pixel_river> true
[0:20:52] <%Irridium> Halo 2 legendary is fucked up man
[0:20:55] <shoryukenabotch> Thank you woolie
[0:20:58] <%Irridium> those fucking jackel snipers
[0:21:02] <irregularly_irregular> Yeah I don't think it's very fun to watch a streamer constantly eat shit in just a few shots <_<
[0:21:04] <%MacabreOpus> On an LP for sure start from Normal. Personally I always play on the hardest, because I'm a masochist
[0:21:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> Miss Rona paid woolie a visit 😢
[0:21:07] <%NottaAlotta> @fazzlerazzle LUL BibleThump
[0:21:17] <@Solidus_113> also in the case of SoC, make the RNG aim on your bullets absolute dogshit garbage
[0:21:22] <RichochetForce> Madame Rona
[0:21:22] <%relentingapunch> Woolie woolieVS COVID-19
[0:21:23] <%Javaa01> Halo's Legendary is not a well balanced difficulty
[0:21:27] <Bubba_Goldnine> Halo 2 legendary is pretty evil
[0:21:33] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Skyrim with all of those brutal difficulty mods is fun as hell. but a completely different experience lol
[0:21:43] <cosmicgoatee> on your own time later it's worth the challenge, exactly it's not wise for a first time ever
[0:21:56] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> World at War on veteran is the only way to play Kappa
[0:21:56] <DeepSearch27> Legendary is flat out designed to be brag rights. Heroic is the correct way.
[0:21:58] <%masterpiecejeremy> Hardest difficulty ruins the experience in Last of Us
[0:22:04] <irregularly_irregular> I mean that makes sense. I started MGR on normal and built myself up to revengeance.
[0:22:12] <%MacabreOpus> That's why Dark Souls was a no-no for many streamers/LPers once they milked an hour long video for first-impressions. It was one and done for many
[0:22:13] <%chosenjuan42> first time playing you should play on intended difficulty
[0:22:14] <RichochetForce> @masterpiecejeremy It ruins most games
[0:22:15] <Prevot> people who do nuzlocke runs on their first time playing a pokemon game are crazy weirdos
[0:22:22] <jsocks654> fire emblem super like that
[0:22:27] <%relentingapunch> DT enemies are rough
[0:22:28] <Ashenik1> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz I always try the hardest first and Skyrim has a terrible one. Its just jarring ;d
[0:22:31] <%relentingapunch> On DMD n shit
[0:22:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> God Hand on hard is just a different game man
[0:22:35] <+Ryu_R> give me DEUS EX RarePepe
[0:22:35] <sahykikserpent> by the time kh3 came out proud mode was the only way for me to play it
[0:22:36] <RichochetForce> DT enemies, IMO, don't feel good
[0:22:38] <%doomerskeletor13> lewdskeletor13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Yo Woolie and Reggie, y’all are some of my favorite streamers/content creators. You both rock, keep on keeping on
[0:22:46] <penitentpentwitch> Activating Sunbro Mode!
[0:22:48] <RichochetForce> Certain enemies turn into dull damage sponges
[0:22:51] <cosmicgoatee> yeah basically DTs all day LUL
[0:22:52] <%jiggy_snipe> well
[0:23:02] <%jiggy_snipe> its easier and harder
[0:23:07] <+RyTYoung> Besides Sekiro
[0:23:11] <%saraizarai> leveling up is also droping dificulty in souls
[0:23:26] <derap41> Well he ain't getting any from the Princess so he had to go with the commons
[0:23:55] <irregularly_irregular> hey ASL is dope.
[0:24:01] <%masterpiecejeremy> Deluxe Honor
[0:24:03] <%SomersaultJustice> is reggie going to sign everything to appeal to wider audiences?
[0:24:14] <%jinking79> Sekiro just has the Bell Demon
[0:24:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Nice, that’s a very cool thing to learn Reggie
[0:24:15] <derap41> Was she the girl next door Woolie?
[0:24:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ALL ROADS LEAD TO GRENADA
[0:24:26] <+BeyondTheGrave07> Hey Woolie love your playthrough of Paper Mario. I just caught up on the YT playlist not sure if its current with where you are at in the live stream
[0:24:26] <%Mr_Ease> they should definitely teach Sign in schools instead of cursive writing
[0:24:30] <+RyTYoung> Just gotta shrink Woolie into the corner of every let's play so he can sign language LUL
[0:24:30] <%chosenjuan42> X gonna give it to ya. woolieOMG
[0:24:33] <@akuda_bar> the only deaf-oriented college in the world is here in this city, so if you go near there it's basically the Deaf Neighborhood
[0:24:36] <+Creggamonsta> what?
[0:24:39] <+RyTYoung> Reggie* I mean goddamit
[0:24:44] <%chosenjuan42> CROSS gonna give it to ya woolieGASM
[0:24:48] <%doomerskeletor13> @beyondthegrave07 Nah it’s a few streamed behind iirc
[0:24:53] <stachystat> Reggie to become the sign translator in the bottom of the screen
[0:24:55] <%KyoryUtchy> Blind hardest difficulty is funny for a one-off stream, but for full LP's it gets old fast.
[0:24:58] <cosmicgoatee> @mr_ease but how would I be able to make my J's look like Q's?
[0:24:59] <%relentingapunch> Chi gon' give it to ya

[0:26:05] <+Juriasu> katanagatari in a nutshell
[0:26:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PUNCH HEROES ARE THE BEST
[0:26:21] <%SomersaultJustice> You can't always trust a sword. Only trust your fists.
[0:26:24] <%relentingapunch> Idea: character action game revolving around a punch hero
[0:26:25] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus yeah more or less the same here, that's what draws me to Unarmed Charaters in weapon fighters. Or just The Normal Guy when everyone else is using magic.
[0:26:26] <+desfore> heihachi in SC2
[0:26:27] <%chosenjuan42> Remember in resident evil when Mr CROSS chases you down? woolieSMUG

[0:28:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Ended like an hour ago I think
[0:28:28] <RichochetForce> They repeated HALO over 300 times
[0:28:31] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus thanks for the answer, I'm glad to hear that our reasons are more or less the same. Always take Normal Guy over a Magic Guy.
[0:28:31] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> no CAR
[0:28:32] <DragonArt07> it ended as you started
[0:28:32] <%Exiliator> There was no stage, it was just trailers LUL
[0:28:40] <TallPixels> More than 50% pre-rendered trailers
[0:28:43] <cosmicgoatee> Balan Wonderland is nice for not being Nights
[0:28:47] <%doomerskeletor13> It was just a bunch of trailers actually
[0:28:48] <%Javaa01> Tetris Effect multiplayer update by the end of the year
[0:28:49] <RichochetForce> Yeah, 70% was CG trailers
[0:28:52] <%relentingapunch> I heard everything I would've wanted to ehar abt on twitter
[0:28:54] <%relentingapunch> tbh
[0:28:54] <%mechslayer71> It was just trailers, and there was no TV. Wasn’t good though
[0:28:56] <%MacabreOpus> Halo is Sekiro with aliens now, v cool
[0:29:07] <+Stormzcales_Lair> You didn't miss much, i wouldn't stress
[0:29:08] <StarMechV> Balan Wonderworld is a spiritual successor in asthetic only. It's more of a platformer than a flight simulator

[0:56:59] <%Papa_Bearman> You just saved the game - buy Attack FX G to see what it is.
[0:57:00] <%M3djedx> umbraHmm
[0:57:00] <%tigerfang86> you cant jump AT ALL
[0:57:00] <+regis_j_rock> No takes 1 away, you lose the ability
[0:57:01] <frigglefroogle> no it means you cant jump at all
[0:57:03] <jettsetter> you lose the ability to jump
[0:57:03] <Iwashi94> can't jump at all
[0:57:03] <%Ancopro> items only
[0:57:05] <hassanico2> I feel Jump benefits more cause multihits
[0:57:06] <%relentingapunch> ATTACK FX G
[0:57:06] <+desfore> YOU CAN'T JUMP
[0:57:07] <Shroomtastic64> its not a +1 -1
[0:57:08] <%chosenjuan42> No you loose ability
[0:57:08] <Jonny_Uppercut> You guys remember the old cartoon Hammerman?
[0:57:10] <+cdrom321> Can't jump at all.
[0:57:10] <+Superbro64> you lose jumping entirely
[0:57:13] <%Proxzo> SFX are just for flare
[0:57:14] <pookam> its funny
[0:57:16] <+regis_j_rock> Yeah
[0:57:17] <shiny_prinny> sfx are just for fun
[0:57:19] <twieetcha> Not a minus you can’t use it at all
[0:57:19] <%ozmon> SFX woolieFUN
[0:57:19] <velgaduere> it says it right there

[0:57:24] <%Solidnick18> you just can't jump
[0:57:25] <Drunkengen> Is he gonna do the Rider Kick?
[0:57:27] <GenericSoda> @jonny_uppercut yes thats what i was referencing
[0:57:29] <%kinetikpaws> woolieFUN
[0:57:30] <%ringabal> Your soul is weighed down by gravity.
[0:57:30] <wintrysoma> fun? in a video game???
[0:57:33] <+Jp3g95> Hammer time vs Jumpman
[0:57:34] <%relentingapunch> woolieFUN
[0:57:38] <%Proxzo> fx is only for fun
[0:57:39] <%M3djedx> That’s ass
[0:57:41] <halfmasks> nah
[0:57:42] <cosmicgoatee> SFX are for fun but if you don't like collecting no effort badges....
[0:57:42] <%relentingapunch> For fun!
[0:57:42] <+Juriasu> it's just cosmetic
[0:57:43] <NiktenKing> Glitzpit rules
[0:57:43] <+desfore> FUN
[0:57:43] <%Solidnick18> no
[0:57:43] <%SomersaultJustice> YES

[0:57:44] <%Exiliator> woolieFUN
[0:57:44] <irregularly_irregular> nop
[0:57:45] <shiny_prinny> sure
[0:57:46] <%relentingapunch> FUN
[0:57:47] <+regis_j_rock> Jumpman is better, but there's still one thing you might want before comitting to it
[0:57:48] <velgaduere> Jump only is fine with Spike Shield tho. pretty good boost
[0:57:48] <+Euphbugg> why not try it
[0:57:48] <%LuckyLagomorph> I care :)
[0:57:48] <missingangle> it's a waste of money tbh
[0:57:49] <%Proxzo> cosmetic
[0:57:49] <Hyper_charger> ISS fun
[0:57:50] <Deadmanslegacy> losing the ability to jump in a Mario game is equal to castration in real life
[0:57:50] <%M3djedx> woolieFUN
[0:57:50] <%Ancopro> woolieFUN

[0:57:56] <%relentingapunch> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[0:57:56] <%AJiiij> I dont think so?
[0:57:59] <noe_juan_kanobe> collectible/cosmetic only
[0:58:00] <+Grayhammatter> you can still do first strikes with hammer, but your jump does infinitely more damage
[0:58:00] <%ozmon> You'll be rich in a few, right? Rat will come through any minute
[0:58:00] <+TuskAct4> Save and check?
[0:58:02] <%chosenjuan42> it's a cheaper power plus. but it has a sacrifice
[0:58:02] <Jonny_Uppercut> @GenericSoda I missed the message, but indeed my man got it before me ayaSHY
[0:58:04] <twieetcha> It’s just for fun
[0:58:06] <DeepSearch27> you missed 20 minutes of sidequest

[0:58:10] <+TheRisingPride> oh right, he wanted to blow the sail.
[0:58:12] <%Karkatstoaster> Ok
[0:58:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IM ON A BOAT
[0:58:14] <%Papa_Bearman> You should probably visit the Thousand-Year Door before you get on the Party Boat.
[0:58:14] <%chosenjuan42> GOLDEN WIND
[0:58:16] <%chosenjuan42> lol
[0:58:17] <%kinetikpaws> gotta talk to some salty dogs
[0:58:17] <@akuda_bar> Doesn't Do Shit
[0:58:18] <%exnuart> its the boat from the smash stage
[0:58:19] <pookam> DREAMIN'
[0:58:21] <Iwashi94> physics!
[0:58:21] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, if you have Spike Shield, what's the point of the hammer?
[0:58:23] <velgaduere> FIGHTING GOOOLD
[0:58:24] <%ozmon> How dare you assume you know how Flurrie works
[0:58:26] <+Juriasu> find the guy who owns the boat
[0:58:28] <%AJiiij> oh they haven't gone to the door yet??
[0:58:30] <missingangle> But didn't he already go to the door?
[0:58:32] <%i_heart_gaming> wait does he have to go to the door?
[0:58:32] <DeepSearch27> Does Mario get off the boat?
[0:58:33] <@akuda_bar> oy fprdm
[0:58:35] <+Wilabeen1997> Nothing
[0:58:36] <GenericSoda> @jonny_uppercut no worries my dude micspammed that song in tf2 back in the day
[0:58:36] <+regis_j_rock> @CappuccinoGuil although rail, there's still fire enemies
[0:58:40] <%sunnythedrunk> He went to the door
[0:58:41] <velgaduere> @CappuccinoGuil nothing. you can use partners to hit ceiling enemies
[0:58:42] <+regis_j_rock> *rare not rail
[0:58:43] <@akuda_bar> *blowing the boat does nothing.
[0:58:43] <+clapbeat> they went to the door
[0:58:45] <%Papa_Bearman> @CappuccinoGuil What if you fight an enemy that takes your Jump away?
[0:58:46] <theCoolChild> Here's how the story goes we find out
[0:58:47] <+xeros720> well, always ask goombella for main story progress
[0:58:47] <%chosenjuan42> talk to people at docks
[0:58:47] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> need ability
[0:58:47] <%ingman112> He has to talk to people at the port
[0:58:49] <%AJiiij> @sunnythedrunk okok
[0:58:50] <Jonny_Uppercut> @GenericSoda Respect
[0:58:50] <%relentingapunch> Goblinos
[0:58:56] <velgaduere> and there's a badge for dealing with fire enemies, too
[0:58:56] <CappuccinoGuil> @Papa_Bearman that can happen? Damn
[0:58:57] <%kinetikpaws> psaGoblin
[0:58:57] <%chosenjuan42> DOCK TALKS
[0:58:57] <+Juriasu> just talk
[0:58:58] <+IceyCone> hammer is more damage at once as opposed to jumping which is multiple hits
[0:59:01] <JetpackMcQuack> So this is the game now I see
[0:59:03] <BreakersAweigh> goblins activated
[0:59:03] <+TheRisingPride> I don't think woolie realizes that she faces the direction of the secret she's sniffing out
[0:59:06] <KaitlynnHere> The goblins are real
[0:59:13] <%Papa_Bearman> @CappuccinoGuil Ever play 'Super Mario RPG'? Bowyer.

[3:13:08] <%SuperKirby24> ah yes, the biggest enemy type: tiddy LUL
[3:13:09] <+Thunderhog> Paper mario 1 had a lakitu
[3:13:10] <%chosenjuan42> MOAR TOADS LATER
[3:13:12] <%elbigante> luigi has the others
[3:13:13] <glass_marcus> Flurries isn't a cloud guys
[3:13:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> @KilogramHours Where's the Buster Sword Kappa
[3:13:16] <Nyerp> we have bobbery and vivan so you can kick flurrie and ms. mowz out now
[3:13:17] <%ozmon> Both Flurrie and Vivian are like, pseudo-Boos. So put em together you got Boo
[3:13:18] <%Ancopro> the first game had a boo and a lakitu
[3:13:22] <+MagiKestral> 64 had a cool lakitu
[3:13:22] <hassanico2> Ok so FLurry is half Lakitu LUL
[3:13:23] <Louie_Salmon> Vivian is much closer to a boo, with the invisiblity
[3:13:27] <SixthSun2> 64 gets all the mainstays pretty much
[3:13:27] <%relentingapunch> Bow and Lakilester
[3:13:29] <+Taglog7> She look like yo boo
[3:13:30] <%chosenjuan42> sticker TOADS and paint TOADS
[3:13:31] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:13:31] <Taarin> There was a literal boo partner in Paper Mario 64
[3:13:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> What are you implying Woolie
[3:13:40] <Taarin> Lady Bow was top tier
[3:13:42] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:13:42] <%Ancopro> there are cloud enemies in the game that youve fought tho
[3:13:42] <hassanico2> The best Boo even
[3:13:49] <missingangle> And 64 also had a sun, that was near
[3:13:50] <missingangle> *neat
[3:13:52] <Hyper_charger> Paper Mario 64 had the traditional enemies as partners
[3:13:53] <%chosenjuan42> 10 hp
[3:13:54] <%relentingapunch> Watt
[3:13:54] <hassanico2> They made a Boo ojou-sama
[3:13:57] <%ozmon> Lady Bow is always the best
[3:14:00] <%relentingapunch> WATT WAS AWESOME
[3:14:00] <%astrofalcon1> btw don't worry chat if you know this game there's a cameo at the end Kappa
[3:14:01] <%ringabal> We didn't deserve a Boo ojou-sama
[3:14:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, you could also do a running start
[3:14:04] <GenericSoda> be patient play footsies
[3:14:05] <glass_marcus> Flurrie is a unique entity
[3:14:10] <%astrofalcon1> don't worry i won't say Kappa
[3:14:10] <hassanico2> Was Watt supposed to be a baby Angry Sun?
[3:14:14] <%RadicalWeegee> Johnathan lakitu
[3:14:15] <%kinetikpaws> I love watt
[3:14:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> Boojou-sama
[3:14:21] <+Jaysky> Hyper_charger Not entirely. They still had unique looks to them.
[3:14:24] <Nyerp> nice try
[3:14:24] <+regis_j_rock> Yeh, Watt is great
[3:14:25] <irregularly_irregular> Watt was supposed to be... electricity...
[3:14:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> And then you put the lime in the coconut
[3:14:26] <%ozmon> Flurrie is the Woods' Greater Wihd Spirit
[3:14:30] <pory_z> wasn't watt supposed to be a spark ?

[3:14:47] <hassanico2> Ok wait I think there's Sparks in SMW right?
[3:14:49] <penitentpentwitch> Throw Bobbery in the hole?
[3:14:49] <%ElbyBoxus> would you trade for luigis partners
[3:14:50] <+Jaysky> Lady Bow was best
[3:14:51] <wintrysoma> watt is a li'l sparky
[3:14:52] <%DensityD> this hole was made for me
[3:14:54] <+cdrom321> Do you remember the song that the merchant used to sing in the bar?
[3:14:54] <Taarin> Watt was from SMW
[3:14:54] <+Grayhammatter> the pickle stone
[3:14:56] <%StaceMcGate> whats that icon above the skull
[3:14:57] <%astrofalcon1> watt is a babby
[3:14:58] <%StaceMcGate> Kappa
[3:14:59] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> shes a bab sparky
[3:15:01] <twieetcha> Pickle shaped hole for a pickle shaped item?!
[3:15:01] <%ozmon> Watt was a Lil' Sparky, the kind what travels along all the surfaces
[3:15:02] <+regis_j_rock> Parakary is also fun
[3:15:02] <%Rekinsinn> Watt would be one of those sparks from world no
[3:15:02] <BlackermanZX> i see a bomb sign up there tho
[3:15:02] <lotharrio> I mean there's a drawing of a bomb above the skull.
[3:15:05] <%relentingapunch> Watt was a bab
[3:15:05] <%exnuart> back to almoFlavio almoFlavio
[3:15:06] <nxflre> Maybe let everyone know Bobbery is okay?
[3:15:07] <%Ancopro> 64 plays it pretty straight with enemies and npcs and was still rad
[3:15:09] <%ozzrabbit> Coconuts for drinks? Forget that, use them to make bras!
[3:15:09] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> goombella?

[3:28:10] <%Proxzo> are the ombs aoe?
[3:28:12] <Lunatyr_> 9 on one
[3:28:13] <%LoVezineTheAir> do it 2 turns in a row
[3:28:14] <%ozmon> Takes so long to actually happen though
[3:28:20] <+regis_j_rock> It's okay, but it does take a minute
[3:28:20] <+Zenryoku21> diminishing returns?
[3:28:20] <%elbigante> charge triple bomb must be good
[3:28:25] <ProtestSaviors> dont forget he doesnt have any upgrades
[3:28:25] <pogostick39> bomb squad + bomb squad is a thing
[3:28:26] <Louie_Salmon> I think they can hit multiple enemies as well, right?
[3:28:26] <%LoVezineTheAir> bomba explode other bombs
[3:28:27] <skyheys> its' less than koops' power shell
[3:28:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> you could get 6 to 9 on 3 enemies
[3:28:29] <BlackermanZX> seems like a boss melter
[3:28:29] <%astrofalcon1> nice
[3:28:29] <+Wilabeen1997> They’re also aoe

[3:28:33] <%DensityD> MORE STYLE
[3:28:34] <+Grayhammatter> can keep laying them down too
[3:28:40] <%chosenjuan42> it can activate other bombs too so you could do 18
[3:28:48] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Also he's unupgraded!
[3:28:56] <%chosenjuan42> if that's how it works
[3:29:06] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, so it will probably jump to 4 damage
[3:29:06] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> is he?
[3:29:11] <logoth_> SUCC
[3:29:20] <hassanico2> @fly2555_of_the_rebellion well we haven't used Shine Sprites on him

[3:30:10] <hassanico2> wow that DOES suck
[3:30:18] <hassanico2> Don't item holders mostly spawn in the back?
[3:30:21] <+TheRisingPride> She's probably the worst party memeber, but that's why she's optional I suppose
[3:30:24] <shiny_prinny> earthquake is the new pow block
[3:30:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> POW Block only useful against enemies you can make fall over
[3:30:31] <+TheRisingPride> Item holders can spawn in any spot
[3:30:34] <%CursedNobleman> you want it to steal badges moreso than items

[3:32:04] <%Proxzo> ohhh
[3:32:06] <ScandalousSam262> iirc Mowz can heal Mario but you can just have any other partner use an item that can heal him for more
[3:32:14] <%Proxzo> sweet treet might be good
[3:32:24] <+regis_j_rock> The heal is only like 10 I think anyway
[3:32:32] <%chosenjuan42> sweat tret
[3:32:37] <%chosenjuan42> lol
[3:32:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> that's perfect for woolie since he only has like 10 hp lmao
[3:32:50] <%DensityD> flavio doesn't want to get his outfit dirty
[3:32:52] <%ozmon> And it's mad expensive
[3:32:52] <hassanico2> You make more than enough money for it

[3:33:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> *15
[3:33:04] <%Proxzo> nice
[3:33:06] <TriadOrion> Yeah, Mowz's heal is basically when you're down to nothing and you have more FP than anything.
[3:33:07] <grimshuck> no need there's heal block
[3:33:08] <%chosenjuan42> woooo block
