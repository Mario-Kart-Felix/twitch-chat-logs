[0:04:49] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> its a valid tactic!
[0:04:50] <%Ancopro> yup correct
[0:04:50] <%eyezehuhh> Stay mad
[0:04:51] <Orenjevel> it's the obvious pick
[0:04:55] <Coystick> Sekiro is the Monument of all Woolie's Sins
[0:05:00] <subjectg> Remember that one Bollywood ad IGN put out for a Halo movie?
[0:05:00] <%ringabal> Power in the palm of your hand, and your lapels
[0:05:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:05:01] <Dean_Inbetween> @thfiddles isnt it soo good?

[0:05:12] <ScionOfTheEmperor> I hope you do ODST, Reach & 4 after this
[0:05:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> I BELIEVE THAT JOHN HALO ACTIVATED FLOOD-KILLING DEVICES THAT WERE SHAPED LIKE A POLE, NOT A RING
[0:05:18] <%Proxzo> @WoolieVersus With Pianta Parlor you have unlimited FP and HP Plus
[0:05:19] <Orenjevel> why would you ever hard-lock your points into things that you can get as items? when you can put points into item load
[0:05:19] <drewslo> the downside is the GRIND
[0:05:19] <%Ancopro> yup
[0:05:26] <brachydios777> @ihateyouo Sounds good so far
[0:05:26] <kingkaito1123> As well as everyone here have a great day

[0:08:35] <+linSP> the 360 ps3 era had hype

[0:08:38] <thegostofjon> is that true? didnt world of warcraft do the mtn dew before that?
[0:08:39] <$deadredeyez> ItsHappening
[0:08:40] <%Reaverund> iirc Halo 3 game fuel has never been produced again
[0:08:41] <DatAsuna> When's halo gamer goo?
[0:08:41] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Halo 3 still looks kino IMO
[0:08:41] <Dean_Inbetween> AND DORITOS
[0:08:41] <+wunp_fxs> agree
[0:08:42] <ralphfromdk> But what about mount' mist? :o

[0:08:46] <%GrumbleGrouse> It does need it, disagree
[0:08:47] <bubbli97> https://clips.twitch.tv/JazzyFineFinchPeteZarollTie also here's a reminder about spoilers for everyone
[0:08:47] <+GarboArbo> Ye
[0:08:47] <GoogleyGareth> Oh yeah the humans are quite oof
[0:08:48] <HereComestheChief> ItsHappening DoritosChip
[0:08:48] <Halospaz117> Halo 3 still has my favorite designs in the series
[0:08:48] <mean_bean1> HALO MADE US GAMERS
[0:08:51] <+wunp_fxs> But the cutscenes wopuld be amazing with blur
[0:08:54] <ColbyBryant> Rip game fuel it was the best flavor
[0:08:55] <VidulaSaix> 3 does still look good but yeah 2 kinda blew it outta the water
[0:08:55] <%kingdovachief> I some what agree
[0:08:57] <%LavenderLaser> pump me full of game fuel
[0:08:57] <Depthcharge2030> blur studios is just too good
[0:08:57] <pixel_river> Dorit pope
[0:08:58] <Louie_Salmon> Cartoony looks helps it age.
[0:08:59] <Dean_Inbetween> It has great lighting
[0:09:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Halo 3 looks great except BOY do those human models look fucking disgusting sometimes
[0:09:00] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Bungie's games always have A+ artstyle/atmosphere
[0:09:00] <%MacabreOpus> I won't say it looks worse, merely different
[0:09:00] <%ArbyW> Halo 3 is still the best looking game in the franchise
[0:09:02] <%allups> Yo woolie I've been playing Fantasy strike All night. i might finally be into fighting games!
[0:09:02] <%hattrick61> Hood look likes a monster

[0:09:05] <Halospaz117> you're sitting tho
[0:09:06] <TheAmazingClaytor> ItsHappening
[0:09:06] <subjectg> It does still look pretty good honestly
[0:09:07] <+Lolo27234> 2007 mind set is needed for this
[0:09:08] <LeBlanc233> We finishing the fight chat
[0:09:09] <vincerocmm> do the dew
[0:09:10] <brachydios777> 3 doesn’t need it right now, maybe in 5 years
[0:09:11] <ralphfromdk> It's 360 era. scalled up to 1080p it looks fine
[0:09:11] <f0rgeman> 13 years
[0:09:11] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> AND IN THE END IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY
[0:09:13] <DesertPenguin> You're sitting down
[0:09:14] <%a_goth_pancake> God I want a man dew now
[0:09:15] <jwhoff619> Halo 3’s lighting is phenomenal
[0:09:15] <ZeroCruz> 3 is great
[0:09:16] <$QueequegTheater> I like Reach's Elites the most but 3 is a close second
[0:09:18] <DigitalJoshie> oh yeah
[0:09:19] <+reconfoxy> old game fuel was like battery acid. i miss it...
[0:09:23] <ihateyouo> FIGHT HARD, DIE WELL
[0:09:25] <BritishTyrannosaur> but who's to judge the right from wrong
[0:09:27] <%kingdovachief> REVENGES MUSIC WITH HALO 3
[0:09:28] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 3 s artstyle still holds up
[0:09:29] <huskarl_zap> 3 is the mose balanced
[0:09:29] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:09:30] <%a_goth_pancake> this
[0:09:33] <%cowardman93> this is THE ONE
[0:09:34] <PleasantLeech> reach is still beautiful
[0:09:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IT HAS TO BE THIS WAAAAAAAY
[0:09:35] <DesertPenguin> COD was before Halo 3
[0:09:37] <DesertPenguin> COD was 2006
[0:09:38] <+Freeborg1997> Pretty sure COD was released before Halo
[0:09:40] <derap41> Hey Woolie otherwise you get Star Citizen
[0:09:41] <ashenjuan25> Fucking nerds
[0:09:43] <ChernoMuncho> i think the lip syncing is the only bad thing about halo 3
[0:09:43] <%RadicalWeegee> HMMM NOPE
[0:09:44] <brian_peppers1> like GTA
[0:09:44] <%RioGascar> Halo 3 was the craziest game
[0:09:45] <+DreyfussFrost> Microsoft isn't Rockstar.
[0:09:46] <%Goingchrisb3> halo 3 OST still kicks hard
[0:09:46] <+D00msDayDan> the problem with bungie is time, not money
[0:09:47] <+reconfoxy> cod4 released after halo 3
[0:09:50] <brachydios777> Light that fire in your heart my guys and gals!
[0:09:52] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Video Games weren't popular enough to have fuck you money yet
[0:09:55] <%RunningNGunning> They're talking about CoD 4 guys
[0:09:56] <%kingdovachief> There was no COD just HALO 3
[0:09:56] <%gunslinger_xxiv> COD4
[0:09:57] <%andrex2311> LUL V
[0:09:57] <+wunp_fxs> Because they want more money to go to them
[0:09:58] <%Ancopro> there was that era of destroying copies of halo 3 as well
[0:09:58] <+eiightbiitt> I bought all the exclusive holographic Halo 3 slurpee cups from 7/11 and i still have them
[0:09:59] <derap41> Gotta have the budget or you Get Star Citizen
[0:09:59] <iamtheTwitchghost> maximize profits man
[0:09:59] <DesertPenguin> B I L L G A T E S
[0:10:00] <%BisoromiBear> it all went to those rad ads
[0:10:04] <alrobot2014> cod4 was 2008 or 07
[0:10:04] <mean_bean1> halo 3 was the peak of AAA games
[0:10:04] <Dean_Inbetween> Its one of the greatest games of all timr
[0:10:05] <DatAsuna> You haven't played enough triple A games if that's what you thought lol
[0:10:05] <+wunp_fxs> omg it was.....
[0:10:07] <%andrex2311> oof
[0:10:07] <DesertPenguin> BILL FUCKING GATES
[0:10:07] <+DreyfussFrost> You think Microsoft got so rich by SPENDING money?
[0:10:07] <subjectg> @freeborg23 yes, but it’s gamer culture didn’t form until cod4
[0:10:07] <%GrumbleGrouse> it was
[0:10:08] <%RyTYoung> weird
[0:10:08] <SoaringLettuce> SET A FIRE IN YOUR HEART SPARTAN

[0:10:14] <brachydios777> Big Microsoft bucks
[0:10:16] <DatAsuna> Most of that money always goes to marketing, not development
[0:10:16] <%Solidnick18> i forgot
[0:10:17] <%mechslayer71> Woolie really is a niche boi
[0:10:19] <%a_goth_pancake> yup

[0:10:31] <%kd2jag> YEYEYEYEYYEYEYEYEY
[0:10:32] <+BigBlackBankai> John Cena and Gamecube
[0:10:35] <%RioGascar> Microsoft spent 40$ million on the advertising campaign for halo 3. AT THE TIME NO COMPANY WAS SPENDING THAT MUCH ADVERTISING GAMEA
[0:10:36] <letshavecakes> 'Infinite budget' just means your ideas get too big and Konami fires you two thirds of the way through
[0:10:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> CEO gotta get his 6 figure bonus Woolie
[0:10:39] <DatAsuna> Delays are way harder to get with this much money on the line
[0:10:40] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> HALO 3 WAS BEFORE ALL THOSE THO
[0:10:41] <$QueequegTheater> JUST THROW MONEY AT IT
[0:10:42] <+wunp_fxs> infinite money, but not time
[0:10:44] <Kato__v> Starry Night
[0:10:46] <DazedCookies> CoD 4 was 2007
[0:10:47] <Louie_Salmon> I really hope woolie plays CoD 4, and no other CoD game
[0:10:49] <jwhoff619> Cod campaigns when?
[0:10:50] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 3 still to this day has some of the best matchmaking convenience that most games today live in the shadow of @woolieversus
[0:10:54] <Orenjevel> I cant believe the Great Gonzales didn't reveal the gamecube
[0:10:55] <Joestar1890> The Xbox Series X is infinitely inferior because it wasn't announced by THE ROCK
[0:10:58] <drewslo> I think at the point of halo 3 Bungie instituted their reduced crunch policy
[0:10:59] <subjectg> Remember that Halo was originally a Mac title, just think about that AU
[0:11:00] <$QueequegTheater> @Louie_Salmon WaW tho
[0:11:01] <ihateyouo> THE WILL OF ATRIOX
[0:11:02] <pixel_river> halo 3 best game ad ive seen
[0:11:10] <Coystick> 320kbps is fine
[0:11:10] <brachydios777> Halo 3 seems to be the start of modern triple A games
[0:11:13] <+MinYoungYi> I don’t think Halo today is the mega juggernaut it used to be
[0:11:15] <The_Introspector> Believe
[0:11:19] <+wunp_fxs> uncompressed is fine
[0:11:21] <runewalker01> Woolie freaking out at the Bible stuff in Halo was amazing. Love the work and stuff I've seen you guys in hope to see more
[0:11:22] <+Bonerlord911> @WoolieVersus did you see any of the halo infinite stuff
[0:11:22] <DesertPenguin> FLAC dude
[0:11:23] <+wunp_fxs> but too damn big
[0:11:24] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> I'll never forget the Believe diorama trailer
[0:11:24] <DesertPenguin> FLAC files
[0:11:25] <Coystick> FLAC is a tax haven
[0:11:29] <%a_goth_pancake> woolz and vee, y'all got two buddies to play the rando no name elites as p3 and p4?
[0:11:30] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Hey I listen to Deezer! lol
[0:11:31] <BritishTyrannosaur> When I get back. We'll look....together
[0:11:31] <%GrumbleGrouse> Flac is Wac
[0:11:32] <%BisoromiBear> but my rotational velocidensity
[0:11:33] <+Stupid121v2> Just had to watch a Halo Infinite trailer to get in here and hoo boy I thought it the gameplay for 3 had already started
[0:11:33] <%kingdovachief> Halo 3 has the best multiplayer but halo 2 has a really good campaign
[0:11:33] <DesertPenguin> worth it
[0:11:33] <alrobot2014> i'm just sitting here with my 100gb flac files
[0:11:35] <MyNameIsRasus> they thicc
[0:11:36] <Dean_Inbetween> Also halo 3 is a better tribute to fallen soldiers than any newer cod game @woolieversus
[0:11:36] <%RadicalWeegee> FLAC is pretty Rad, i love em on my walkman
[0:11:38] <%Asuterisuku> I'd probably get an APU eventually, but man.
[0:11:39] <DesertPenguin> I have a 2TB hard drive. Bring it
[0:11:40] <+eiightbiitt> Halo Reach ad campaign was fuckin awesome aswell
[0:11:41] <$QueequegTheater> IT WON'T FIT SENPAI WutFace Kreygasm
[0:11:41] <DSD24> I don't know what FLAC is
[0:11:43] <+wunp_fxs> wow really?
[0:11:44] <GoogleyGareth> lol yeah
[0:11:44] <Coystick> Yoooo
[0:11:45] <%GrumbleGrouse> Truth
[0:11:46] <Louie_Salmon> @queequegtheater Did it ever get the remaster treatment though? And I remember it more for the zombies mode and multiplayer anyway.
[0:11:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg my dad never forgave Bungie for that. He's one of those guys who had a Apple 2 and never fully accepted the idea that they're not a cool countercultural brand anymore and havent been for like 25 years
[0:11:51] <derap41> Yeah it was awesome
[0:11:53] <Coystick> Based Sony
[0:11:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[0:11:53] <Dean_Inbetween> 3 MADE ME CRY
[0:11:54] <%Asuterisuku> @DSD24 "Free Lossless Audio Codec"
[0:11:55] <+wunp_fxs> huh....
[0:11:55] <DesertPenguin> But doesn't it matter what your speaker system is?
[0:11:57] <%Javaa01> FLAC still makes a difference, but they're a sometimes thing, for the albums you REALLY care about
[0:11:59] <TheAmazingClaytor> Then the PS4 can't play em
[0:11:59] <+Stupid121v2> Fuckin Sony man
[0:12:03] <ChernoMuncho> PS2 MONOLITH

[0:12:04] <DesertPenguin> But your speaker system matters too
[0:12:05] <derap41> Playstation always wanted to be a media device not a gamer device
[0:12:05] <drewslo> dvd on the ps2
[0:12:06] <Coystick> That's why Vib Ribbon was the SHIT
[0:12:07] <%Asuterisuku> Emphasis on Lossless.
[0:12:10] <letshavecakes> You gonna watch the Believe campaign? It's a lot more than that one TV spot, and it's also been over a decade
[0:12:16] <DSD24> @Asuterisuku I see it now thanks for clarifying
[0:12:16] <$QueequegTheater> @Louie_Salmon I remember charging up the steps of the Reichstag and planting the Soviet flag, but to each their own
[0:12:18] <DesertPenguin> I'm a bit of audiophile but I won't go crazy
[0:12:19] <TomFrancis_> im an audio file Kappa
[0:12:24] <Reilata> Haha playing Castlevania SotN music and getting that Alucard warning about it not being music.

[0:13:20] <Halospaz117> God I love Dead Space game overs
[0:13:25] <penitentpentwitch> Man, Dead Space keeps coming up. Woolie never played it, huh?
[0:13:25] <Klefth> Just get the headphones that sound good to you or have a sound signature that you like, and a dac amp combo that can drive them properly. That's it.
[0:13:26] <DSD24> Dead Space 1 is so brutal
[0:13:26] <%MaddyCaddy> 👀
[0:13:26] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Dead Space 1's death sequences are super good
[0:13:26] <DatAsuna> Death animations not quite what I meant, but sure xD
[0:13:26] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus My mom brought our bulldogs to meet a guy on Craigslist in a parking lot to buy a 360 to get me and my brother Halo 3 back in 2007
[0:13:26] <+twohitgood> most people can't differentiate a 192kbps mp3 from an uncompressed wave. and realistically, the difference isn't notable enough even if you can tell the difference. cymbals and highs sound better defined but that's about it.
[0:13:29] <+wunp_fxs> lol yep
[0:13:30] <ashenjuan25> In the name of the gravemind, the arbiter and the holy chief, you shall finish the fight

[0:27:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Bruh
[0:27:21] <+Bonerlord911> DID YOU JUST SAY YVWH
[0:27:22] <%13ry4n93> the spartan 3s were even more fucked than the spartan 2s (that the master chief is part of) because they were pre-teens and early teenagers hopped on spartan steroids sent to die on suicide missions. These children were orphans of the human-covenant war and had their planets glassed and were therefore hopped up on revenge.
[0:27:27] <ashenjuan25> Hindu religion seems really cool to adapt to a game
[0:27:32] <derap41> This is just 40k again
[0:27:33] <MyNameIsRasus> @Bonerlord911 Yes. Problem?
[0:27:35] <dundunsun> Messiah is the Jesus persona
[0:27:36] <%LavenderLaser> he said the word

[0:27:41] <turbofolk> @a_goth_pancake actually tho?
[0:27:43] <orangezeus759> after you finish this game you should do a watchthrough of the halo wars 1 and 2 cutscenes
[0:27:43] <duskrush> That's the plot of American Gods
[0:27:46] <Klefth> You mean YH--disc scratch?
[0:27:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> also the Spartan 3s were MEANT to die on their missions and the last batch have a neuro-degenerative Devil Trigger implant
[0:27:50] <+Bluemanzee> SMT is like Chalk Zone
[0:27:51] <%krispen_wa> Huh
[0:27:51] <%ArthurDayne88> ArthurDayne88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Can't believe they made a whole series based on a Beyonce song
[0:27:52] <R0dn3y> Really enjoyed the Halo streams so far! Actually started to play Halo 3 for the first time with a friend yesterday, he joked we should do it on Legendary, so we did. V is definitely right; that's stream poison but hella challenging and fun.
[0:27:52] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus As a practicing Catholic, the JRPG "let's kill god" trope makes me super uncomfortable, so I doubt I'll play the new one
[0:27:54] <%Superspider51> Stream SMT Nocturne featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series some day
[0:27:54] <wintrysoma> messiah is the generic savior figure, agony is actually jesus

[0:28:11] <%krispen_wa> except we've killed YHVH several times now and he always comes back
[0:28:13] <+Freeborg1997> I loved the plot of that game. Watched the cutscenes on Youtube.
[0:28:13] <ashenjuan25> Smt > persona tbh
[0:28:13] <Torivore> It's Yahveh or the highway
[0:28:14] <Reilata> I even know about a lot of creatures due to the variety of SMT( +various subtitle) games.
[0:28:19] <%a_goth_pancake> @turbofolk nah, it's that message at the beginning of each assins cree game
[0:28:19] <%mikessdd> Okay why are we getting highlights of reach spoilers. Woolie will know when he's meant to know
[0:28:22] <+MaskedBugman> Theres an edgey comic called God is dead, God dies and all the old pantheons decide to come back and fight to reclaim the earth
[0:28:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Delete Jordan, Lebron and Curry Ascend
[0:28:29] <%BisoromiBear> PS2 is the best DVD player

[0:28:34] <ralphfromdk> ps2 for dvd's :D
[0:28:36] <+TheotherKristian> Is it worth it to get Metroid Prime trilogy or do I keep trying to run it with my dolphin
[0:28:37] <derap41> The PS2 was a good DVD player
[0:28:40] <alrobot2014> so the ps3 isn't the best blu ray player?
[0:28:40] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @QueequegTheater if it's any consolation, the Abrahamic God is already canonically dead after SMT IV, so you'll probably be killing satan in V :)
[0:28:40] <drewslo> used to live in Portland, I'm not surprised at anything
[0:28:49] <+ghostfaceninja_> Preacher is great if you like the whole kill god type stuff

[0:28:54] <nakedsnake848> hey when it comes out will you be playing ODST

[0:29:44] <%jiggy_snipe> the military is active in getting involved in Hollywood and Gaming
[0:29:45] <BritishTyrannosaur> Halo 4 is peobably the first game to critique the military tbh
[0:29:46] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus That's not the second line in the constitution that's the second line in the Bill of Rights which is after the constitution
[0:29:46] <+Ultimate_Edge> But those guns tho
[0:29:48] <ralphfromdk> and we all get played like fiddles
[0:29:48] <%RioGascar> Halo 3 probably marked the whole AAA gaming landscape change

[0:30:02] <DSD24> Beyond Two Souls sucked
[0:30:02] <Clear_Truth> Hi Woolie and v
[0:30:03] <ofalconer> Starship Troopers is critiquing the military mindset
[0:30:03] <+linSP> I got a friend who loves guns, Merica flag, military, and HALO
[0:30:03] <$QueequegTheater> He's legit good at bad ends
[0:30:05] <The_Swedish_X> I like that I can tell V's got a hot take/tmi to respond to by how he moves to the mic.
[0:30:06] <%ArbyW> Based take
[0:30:06] <%RyTYoung> Failing that chase scene is the only way to play it LIL
[0:30:08] <drewslo> yeah we glorify the military, but we also know they are incompetent
[0:30:09] <%spacebowie749> starship troopers was a parody of that mindset
[0:30:09] <%a_goth_pancake> mark whalberg What? noooo
[0:30:09] <Pookiedaexzile> StarShip Troopers was made by the dude who made Robocop, It was Satire nobody got
[0:30:13] <+JustToWatch> Starship Troopers (the movie) is absolutely not pro military
[0:30:17] <%krispen_wa> The Second Ammendment doesn't even work anymore since what can guns do against a fucking Stealth Bomber?
[0:30:20] <gotaragingsofty> Fun fact: Halo 2 was literally written by the son of a preacher man
[0:30:23] <+yhom_tork> monkaS
[0:30:25] <Dean_Inbetween> Industrial Military Complex also dont forget the Prison Police Industrial Complex
[0:30:28] <PleasantLeech> just because we've been away war for almost our entire country's life doesn't mean we're obsessed with war what.
[0:30:33] <%MaddyCaddy> Yee haw
[0:30:36] <BritishTyrannosaur> the starhip troopers sequels i imagine have no satire at all
[0:30:38] <+Andrizzleton> is this before they start playing or after?
[0:30:40] <+Bluemanzee> @Pookiedaexzile The guy that made the movie especially couldn't get the irony. Still like the movie though
[0:30:52] <+number_1_ninja> Before

[0:31:11] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[0:31:11] <+Dragoneye77> Is Woolie going do ODST and Halo 4 when they get added to PC pogonaThink
[0:31:11] <%doomerskeletor13> The Starship Troopers book was pro-fascism essentially but the movie went the opposite direction and took the piss out of it
[0:31:14] <%Deadpal> Terminals do NOT WORK in co-op except for one level.
[0:31:15] <Sullry> What’s the point of a country if a stealth bomber blows up everything you need people for a country. Thats the whole point
[0:31:19] <bootiesauce2> Woolie this is unrelated but I have to ask why the fuck did you tell Pat to skip ZZ Gundam? It’s almost as good as Zeta coward

[0:34:04] <Redmannasah> 5's multi is great, but story is ehhhh
[0:34:04] <huskarl_zap> i got bored through 4
[0:34:05] <+treborant> I didnt care, For me the series ended in 3

[0:34:17] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> 4 has a good campaign. Multiplayer is eh. 5 is trash
[0:34:17] <%MacabreOpus> Does Chief see Cortana as attractive? Or more like a mother/sister-figure?
[0:34:18] <%stayinthepocket> I recently replayed it and after not feeling it so much I get it now. The multiplayer is really not good though.

[0:54:50] <$Sfaux97> Cheer500 Hey Woolie, glad to see you playing my favorite game series of all time. Just wanted to ask, what made you want to play it all of a sudden? Are you prepping to play Halo Infinite? Also I'm a little late to the party, but jokes on you V, there totally is a Spartan 1337 in Halo Legends
[0:54:50] <@Menitta> It still looks nice
[0:54:50] <DSD24> This on Heroic?

[0:54:56] <+GarboArbo> I'm glad

[0:54:57] <Joestar1890> This lighting is timeless
[0:54:57] <Goraka91> It looked great when it came out
[0:54:58] <+BigBlackBankai> Halo 3 AR is solid
[0:55:00] <prime_name> I'm getting hit with a huge wave of nostalgia
[0:55:01] <sniffy77> wait till u see some of theh faces
[0:55:02] <brachydios777> This is on heroic

[0:55:04] <%Totally_Not_Toby> Still looks better than Infinite Kappa
[0:55:05] <%cowardman93> this game aged real well
[0:55:06] <+jeasybakeoven> When I was a boy, i loved the AR, but when I became a man I accepted the BR
[0:55:06] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> It's super solid
[0:55:07] <Phort909> Mainly the faces that don't hold up
[0:55:08] <DinoBear_7> AR is actually pretty decent on this one because brutes have weak shields

[0:57:30] <$QueequegTheater> @davey0000 "Hideo gets motion sickness, so he wasn't able to look at the game much. I remember he asked me to shoot a plant near the start of the jungle level. When it reacted, he nodded in affirmation and walked off."
[0:57:32] <@Menitta> do not reload
[0:57:36] <@Menitta> never reload
[0:57:36] <%13ry4n93> some brutes don't have shields at all

[0:57:51] <alrobot2014> grenade throw range is HUGE in 3
[0:57:51] <%Asuterisuku> Brutes got so heavily nerfed in this one.
[0:57:52] <%MacabreOpus> Volume seems fine and no lag yet...
[0:58:00] <@Squdnate> Audio is fine
[0:58:00] <%Gruhunchously> Ladies and Gentlemen, we are at war
[0:58:02] <%krispen_wa> Brutes are just reskinned Elites in Halo 3

[0:58:18] <%johnny_gogo> @Asuterisuku i feel they where little to spongy in 2 tho
[0:58:18] <mamobelty> God the nostalgia is real
[0:58:20] <BritishTyrannosaur> man that carbine sound
[0:58:22] <%GrumbleGrouse> NO arc on the brute shot and way less on grenades in this compared to 2
[0:58:23] <DigitalJoshie> no reload run
[0:58:23] <+Andrizzleton> the carbine is so much better in 3 than 2
[0:58:24] <+Orenalos> monke
[0:58:24] <+GarboArbo> SHAVE HIM
[0:58:25] <%13ry4n93> it annoys me that we don't get friendly grunts and hunters
[0:58:26] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @krispen_wa basically, except IIRC their shields don't recharge and they still go ballistic
[0:58:28] <%Totally_Not_Toby> idk that they got nrerfed, you could kill them in like two shots from the carbine to the head in 2
[0:58:31] <%Solidnick18> nice nade

[0:58:55] <%kd2jag> Half the crew of Firefly as marine VO = BEST
[0:58:57] <DazedCookies> IS THAT THE CHIPS DUBBO?!
[0:59:01] <subjectg> they’re on heroic
[0:59:03] <armchairmaster_> You think any of these Brutes are craig's cousin Kappa
[0:59:04] <%krispen_wa> Man, this game still looks great for a 2007 game
[0:59:06] <Drarrk> nice
[0:59:09] <+BigBlackBankai> Heroic Heptameter
[0:59:09] <BinaryShuffle> Plasma pistol also disables vehicles iirc

[0:59:14] <+Andrizzleton> Alan two dicks is in this game yeah?
[0:59:14] <%Asuterisuku> @johnny_gogo Which is fine, I suppose, considering that you're no longer fighting Elites and need a better rank and file foe than Grunts.
[0:59:17] <%cowardman93> Halo 3 hud onwards is the best
[0:59:19] <%Solidnick18> saved
[0:59:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Great for parkouring
[0:59:24] <%MacabreOpus> This game looks incredible they were smart with their baked lighting back then
[0:59:26] <$QueequegTheater> Halo 3 looks better than most early current gen titles
[0:59:27] <BritishTyrannosaur> i remember when people thought halo 3 was cartoony
[0:59:32] <MyNameIsRasus> 2k people, sick
[0:59:34] <MetaChiefVoices> WARRIORS OF BRUTE CHIEFTAIN CRAIG

[0:59:55] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[0:59:55] <%13ry4n93> @MyNameIsRasus Halo 3 still draws people in
[0:59:55] <%Cozy90> which difficulty did they set it to? i didnt see
[0:59:58] <DazedCookies> the battle is ours! Chipps Dubbo is here to save us!

[1:00:09] <+GarboArbo> very
[1:00:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh god I forgot about Chips Dubbo
[1:00:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> it's big nerfed

[1:00:14] <mdkcde> They still look better than Halo Infinite
[1:00:14] <BritishTyrannosaur> ready for cortana seizure?
[1:00:14] <%Totally_Not_Toby> @nxflre they're on heroic, yeah
[1:00:17] <alrobot2014> tighter spread
[1:00:19] <nxflre> thanks
[1:00:20] <%MacabreOpus> @BritishTyrannosaur Halo is undeniably cartoony but it's a fine line between photoreal and stylistic art direction
[1:00:22] <Louie_Salmon> I think it's little more accurate
[1:00:23] <+GarboArbo> more accurate tho
[1:00:27] <thesoldierofjoy> more accurate but worse damage and ammo
[1:00:28] <+Msytic6> Skull?
[1:00:28] <@Menitta> Oh yeah 2 never had the assault rifle
[1:00:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is it OP to give all the marines Brute Shots?
[1:00:30] <armchairmaster_> WutFace less bullets
[1:00:37] <%Pigg1yJuffs> God. I hate mobile. To the guy I accidentally sent a friend request to, just ignore it.
[1:00:40] <%johnny_gogo> @Asuterisuku i do wish they where tougher in this game just not as crazy as halo 2 brutes
[1:00:42] <+MaskedBugman> 32 is weird number considering magazines in realife are 30-60
[1:00:43] <AceOne5> its good to finish off unarmored enemies anyway

[1:01:48] <Louie_Salmon> Jacker sniples
[1:01:48] <+eiightbiitt> mauler is stubby shotgun

[1:02:40] <Joestar1890> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Really? never seen them on normal, or the beam rifle. They're in Heroic and Legendary?
[1:02:41] <%kd2jag> ITS LITERALLY ON THE SCREEN
[1:02:45] <%UnknownZealot77> I think the spiker should been a slower firing, harder hitting weapon
[1:02:46] <Louie_Salmon> It's an SMG
[1:02:46] <%emperordread> Grunts go down quicker than my ex wife after a bottle of wine

[1:03:13] <%doomerskeletor13> @oldmandeckardcain Or he just sucks lmao
[1:03:18] <VidulaSaix> Yeah this room can be a bit rough
[1:03:19] <%Deadpal> wait
[1:03:20] <+yhom_tork> h3 on heroic is actually kinda tough
[1:03:20] <+BigBlackBankai> At every angle it penetrates
[1:03:21] <+Avossk_> Brutes are always high priority targets
[1:03:23] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Joestar1890 Yeah, I just played through on heroic and there's still a good handful of them with the beam rifle. Not as many as H2, but enough to be annoying. Also carbines are still OHKOs if you have your shield down
[1:03:23] <%Deadpal> is woolie on heroic again?
[1:03:23] <%Cozy90> haha halo 3 not pulling any early punches
[1:03:25] <%GrumbleGrouse> there's some good bubble and drop shield tech you can do
[1:03:34] <%MacabreOpus> They must be on Heroic
[1:03:44] <AceOne5> the best thing if you are close is to go inside a Bubble shield and throw a grenade since the AI prioritizes going inside over diving away
[1:03:46] <+Dragoneye77> woolie just casually walking up to a fusion coil
[1:03:47] <%krispen_wa> Is Halo 3 the one where you get Royal Guard?
[1:03:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Stay determined, you have to finish the fight
[1:03:48] <$QueequegTheater> Yes, take cover behind the red barrel
[1:03:51] <BritishTyrannosaur> found out you can shoot through the drop shield with unsc weapons
[1:03:51] <+jeasybakeoven> bubble shield+spike grenade absolutely key
[1:03:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE monkaS
[1:03:53] <+HoodieWheats> Jackals continue to suck shit
[1:03:55] <OldManDeckardCain> @lewdskeletor13 nah, I'm pretty sure I was right LUL
[1:03:56] <The_Introspector> There's one right next to woolie
[1:03:56] <+yhom_tork> right in front of him LUL
[1:03:57] <+ghostfaceninja_> anybody remember the mauler in Perfect Dark LUL
[1:03:58] <%Asuterisuku> I don't like the bug that's in the collection involving challenge progress resetting every time you boot up the game.
[1:03:58] <Kalixas> Yeeeeeee
[1:03:59] <akosinoogie> they're defonotely playing on heroic, i saw it on their lobby
[1:04:12] <%valiard> Covenant use gungan shield bubbles confirmed Kappa
[1:04:13] <$serpenttucker> The fact that you can pick up and throw exploding barrels in infiite is an unexpected addition
[1:04:13] <+GiantPapaDoug> yep playing on heroic
[1:04:24] <+GiantPapaDoug> halo 3 has less jackle snipers than 2
[1:04:29] <%Asuterisuku> @serpenttucker But not unwelcome.
[1:04:31] <ravencloak13> I;m experiencing childhood memories again...
[1:04:33] <$QueequegTheater> *Grifshot
[1:04:34] <RahuHordika> He has learned to reload!
[1:04:34] <+GiantPapaDoug> but they're still 2 shot on heroic 1 shot on legendary
[1:04:35] <SparkAfterDark> I love that woolie always wants shooters to have fast action and viable melee and yet in the series that has a really excellent melee option he slowly backs up at all times
[1:04:37] <Joestar1890> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug I never knew Carbines could even be OHKO's. Enemy AIs seemed to just absorb the hits
[1:04:40] <+Trenton28> Woolie is doing better than before imo
[1:04:49] <+TreeeFOX> whats up with the bit rate?
[1:04:50] <Floofiie> I thought jackal snipers just stripped shields on legendary
[1:04:59] <+GarboArbo> I think it's slower actually
[1:05:01] <VidulaSaix> Needler is so goddamn strong
[1:05:02] <%13ry4n93> @GiantPapaDoug also some of the jackal snipers have carbines
[1:05:03] <$QueequegTheater> F
[1:05:05] <PrideOfFiddles> That's t he same rate of fire as H2 no?
[1:05:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Fuck those aliens

[1:05:11] <%Williamld> The Arbiter and his laser eyes

[1:05:15] <DasFreekman> still no reloads. gonna be a long day for me
[1:05:17] <Torivore> Eye lasers
[1:05:18] <NewWillinium> You know? I don't think I ever really used the Mauler or the Spiker.
[1:05:19] <subjectg> H2 is faster I feel
[1:05:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Joestar1890 carbines are ohkos on headshots without shields like BRs, you just have to pop their shield first. it's a good way to take out brutes
[1:05:21] <Tucker0603> ITS A SPIKE THOUGH MAN
[1:05:22] <+novacrusader727> Bullets come from your face
[1:05:22] <%krispen_wa> It seems faster in general, but doesn't get as fast as when you slam the hammer in H2
[1:05:22] <armchairmaster_> Jebaited Rip dual wield needler
[1:05:22] <+GiantPapaDoug> ah well yeah i usuakly specify them as carbine jackles myself
[1:05:23] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> yea, i think it does have better melee

[1:05:23] <%Totally_Not_Toby> needler is real good in this game

[1:05:35] <%Superspider51> halo 3 needler is great
[1:05:35] <Joestar1890> IT'S THE BEST NEEDLER THO
[1:05:36] <thesoldierofjoy> It was way too op
[1:05:38] <+BigBlackBankai> It does a bit more melee damage
[1:05:39] <$serpenttucker> It even says spiker on the bottom of the screen
[1:05:39] <+GiantPapaDoug> and yes i believe the AI is very tuned down compared to 2
[1:05:40] <praisedasun_> pat was a liar
[1:05:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> it's so fucking strong
[1:05:43] <%Heavensguard92> Its still strong

[1:11:54] <akosinoogie> oh, this is the walk in the woods remix for 3?
[1:11:55] <The_Introspector> Plasma Master? But the Brute Shot isn't a plasma weapon.
[1:11:57] <Joestar1890> But it's perfect other than that
[1:11:58] <%Jbulleit97> Do we have V’s favorite Halo soundtrack on record yet?
[1:11:58] <+liquidzr0> SourPls
[1:11:59] <Goraka91> @akosinoogie There is a BTTV addon that adds animated emotes and more in general, such as SourPls or monkaS

[1:12:06] <+linSP> I cry when halos deserve to die
[1:12:08] <%HyperBomb21> @akosinoogie also if you better TV, sourPls is animated
[1:12:14] <Captain_sevatar> I shall now forever refer to the brute shot as GrUnTDeStR0YeR
[1:12:14] <%jorniev> imagine getting a granade shot into your skull

[1:12:26] <$serpenttucker> I hope woolie knows the reason why there are 2 more shots for the brute shot
[1:12:26] <%Slimshazbot> Favorite soundtrack is hard choice between 2 and ODST for me
[1:12:30] <ChernoMuncho> nice frag throw

[1:17:19] <KaitlynnHere> @dynamo_commando the idea is that you’re shooting it so much that everything turns to sand, and then the sand gets melted into glass
[1:17:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Reject modernity, return to monke
[1:17:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Started on MGS2....and was like "this franchise ain't for me"
[1:17:26] <+einherjarvalk> Chief you killed a child...AMAZING MISSION COMPLETE
[1:17:26] <+GarboArbo> It's bad
[1:17:27] <coracor> they, uh, choose to do the grenade thing though
[1:17:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> They PULL them out
[1:17:27] <SpaceGuntank> the way everyone talks about playing MGS it almost makes me seem insane that i started with the first one. LUL
[1:17:27] <Joestar1890> Halo 3, the true random chimp moment of 2020
[1:17:29] <DinoBear_7> Now we really need the birthday party skull
[1:17:29] <gade177> I always play on Legendary it just feels so rewarding after getting through a level.
[1:17:30] <BritishTyrannosaur> you want breakfast? you gotta catch it
[1:17:31] <%TheWharff> HORT HORT HORT
[1:17:34] <+yhom_tork> grunt birthday party LuL
[1:17:35] <thesoldierofjoy> BR in 3 actually shoots a hair slower in between bursts.
[1:17:38] <Goraka91> Shaved Brutes are just the worst
[1:17:40] <%jorniev> stop
[1:17:40] <marvel877> Carbine's kinda meh.
[1:17:42] <AMUSERNAME> So much of V's commentary is pure Kappa material.
[1:17:44] <+BigBlackBankai> FOR THE GREAT JOURNEY
[1:17:48] <@Solidus_113> click click
[1:17:49] <%Cozy90> wow woolie is abit more sensitive to self sacrifice than i thought
[1:17:49] <VidulaSaix> I find H3's Carbine far too weak
[1:17:50] <Captain_sevatar> I really do not like the carbine's sight
[1:17:55] <%Asuterisuku> Not as accurate, but a higher rate of fire.
[1:17:56] <Dynamo_Commando> Hence the term “glassing”, ok I understand thanks 👍.
[1:17:56] <+Andrizzleton> Halo2 legendary is much harder than halo 3 imo
[1:17:59] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Jackal snipers are much less accurate on heroic and legendary in this game than they were in H2 respectively
[1:18:00] <ZeroCruz> Carabine 4 life
[1:18:01] <%raven_frame> Has Woolie seen the grenade grunt being thrown by a brute yet?
[1:18:06] <Joestar1890> I like my brutes hairy and gorilla-like thank you
[1:18:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> man Halo 3 is almost as nostalgic as CE for me
[1:18:08] <+OneGorillionDollars> carbine is Pog
[1:18:08] <Sullry> Pretty sure that’s them doing it willingly
[1:18:09] <%doomerskeletor13> I want a Grunt companion :( I would protect him at all costs
[1:18:09] <brachydios777> Carbines in ODST Kreygasm
[1:18:11] <Tucker0603> again carbine is the best
[1:18:14] <+Bonerlord911> woolie is going to be asking "can you cloak" at the end of the level
[1:18:14] <AmericanaRed> potastDorime1 potastDorime2 potastDorime4 potastDorime3
[1:18:25] <Goraka91> @raven_frame I assume he's ignoring all later Halo stuff to avoid spoilers
[1:18:26] <%phatmac16> Did they nerf all the guns in 3?
[1:18:26] <Maids4lyfe> Arby's cloak is gone wtf
[1:18:27] <%Superspider51> elites share the same hitbox as spartans so yeah
[1:18:30] <Sullry> These are supposed to be the most fanatical forces
[1:18:30] <%Asuterisuku> Arby cloaking in the cutscene is such a tease.
[1:18:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:18:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Andrizzleton except this level with Jackal Snipers, and Cortana

[1:19:06] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Dynamo_Commando the covenant would straight up fire plasma on every square inch of a planet over the span of a couple of weeks, so the planet would straight up be glassed, where all the ground is melted
[1:19:06] <Phort909> Is it good for killing child soliders?

[1:19:07] <+Andrizzleton> I've been playing through along woolz and halo 2 is some bullshit
[1:19:07] <HereComestheChief> HALO IS DEAD NotLikeThis
[1:19:07] <gade177> Were they begging u not 2 kill them?
[1:19:07] <squidmax1> Well now you gotta play Warzone in Halo 5 to see grunts in power.
[1:19:09] <%BoondockJoker> the craig's shall rise
[1:19:10] <+Bonerlord911> this is the most powerful needler in the series easy
[1:19:11] <Dean_Inbetween> They were screaming and crying like kids like the first game
[1:19:12] <thebestestkevin> I always felt a little bad whenever i killed grunts in these games. I always thought they were cute
[1:19:12] <ZeroCruz> They gotta go man
[1:19:12] <%phatmac16> HALO CANCELLED
[1:19:13] <%blackomega0101> Needler in 3 is better than 2. lol
[1:19:16] <%Cozy90> the brutes sound like elites
[1:19:17] <Joestar1890> It's arguably the best needlers have ever been
[1:19:17] <Torivore> Kids shouldn't have shot first
[1:19:18] <idiotscampaign> H3 needler is frankly the best version
[1:19:19] <subjectg> @superspider51 not quite, for example it’s harder to headshot an elite from the back
[1:19:20] <PleasantLeech> needler got a hair cut
[1:19:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Our lord and savior Craig
[1:19:21] <%jorniev> OH GOD
[1:19:22] <torres_kun> Lmfao they’re all screaming and crying. Now I feel bad
[1:19:23] <+RicardoRuizr> Needler is even better in 3 than in 2
[1:19:24] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> It’s actually better
[1:19:25] <someweeb95> I feel bad killing grunts now
[1:19:27] <letshavecakes> Needler is still a war crime
[1:19:27] <%Asuterisuku> The bubble shield looks so weird with DoF.
[1:19:28] <%Slimshazbot> Not all the time though, for certain parts
[1:19:29] <+yhom_tork> craig monkaS'
[1:19:34] <DazedCookies> There is no need to be upset
[1:19:36] <%emperordread> the grunts dropped their guns and showed you their backs, hands up as they rout
[1:19:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Every time woolie cyrHands
[1:19:37] <akosinoogie> the needler's needles look kinda shitty here in 3 Tho
[1:19:37] <mamobelty> You need a little Grunt Birthday Party to relieve yourself of your sins
[1:19:38] <liphttam1> Wait he can die?
[1:19:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LET ME LIVE
[1:19:38] <+GarboArbo> LET ME LIVE
[1:19:39] <Goraka91> Let him live! PepeHands
[1:19:40] <%UnknownZealot77> Lol Halo 3 needler was the first GOOD needler
[1:19:40] <coracor> LET ME LIVE BibleThump
[1:19:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> LET ME LIVE
[1:19:40] <%cowardman93> he also will go off in certain parts of the game
[1:19:42] <+SteveTheSpoon> LET ME LIVE
[1:19:43] <+Krecart> He can totally get killed temporarily tho.
[1:19:44] <Dynamo_Commando> Honestly a halo game with a ragtag group of ex covenant aliens made up of a grunt, jackal, elite and brute would probably be interesting.
[1:19:44] <%Superspider51> @subjectg yeah there's some clipping errors. Like there's just a part of the elites neck that cannot be hit
[1:19:45] <+yhom_tork> LET ME LIVE
[1:19:45] <$serpenttucker> The ginger nature of woolie firing the brute shot is fucking me up.
[1:19:46] <+wah_ha_ha> Kill all the Craigs
[1:19:48] <Firststrike_OW> LET ME LIVE BibleThump
[1:19:49] <+Dragoneye77> woolie trying to sticky V

[1:19:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> idk if this is spoilers so whisper me if it is, but why are we fighting grunts still? I thought they sided with the elites?
[1:19:55] <theother1122> let me live BibleThump
[1:19:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> sometimes on single player arbiter will straight up die and then 30 seconds later hop back up and keep fighting like nothing happened it's hilarious

[1:20:06] <gade177> I killed a Grunt and the others started crying about their friend being killed. I felt so bad.
[1:20:07] <Jsutton1254> big green war criminal
[1:20:09] <KaitlynnHere> You guys should get the cheat going that whenever the grunts die there’s a cheer. It’ll make you feel less bad @woolieversus
[1:20:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DO YOU FEEL LIKE A HERO YEY?
[1:20:12] <MagiKestral> wait has woolie not used a mounted gun yet??

[1:45:07] <derap41> He's shooting the stand XD
[1:45:08] <The_Introspector> It's weird seeing someone actually fight the enemies in this room instead of just gunning them all down with the turret as they drop in.
[1:45:10] <JTEIO> turrets are so good in this game
[1:45:10] <slix3431> Why evac here? The capitial ship is right outside

[1:47:32] <%mccf> that was "what ship is that" not what kind of ship is that
[1:47:35] <$Slipknotlobster> Light cruisers are purple, heavy cruisers are white. Carriers are massive and white and super obvious.
[1:47:39] <mamobelty> Cue Wide Chief*
[1:47:40] <%Asuterisuku> You move faster by strafe walking with that thing.
[1:47:41] <Dean_Inbetween> Ugh

[1:47:46] <Tucker0603> it looks the best with hammer on your back
[1:47:47] <%raven_frame> Woolie you go faster if you walk at an angle.
[1:47:48] <unclekulikov> jumpp makes it go faster
[1:47:50] <BritishTyrannosaur> i try to keep the turret for the brutes

[1:47:53] <%doomerskeletor13> I want a ship named “Mutually Assured Destruction”
[1:47:54] <Dean_Inbetween> Woolie and his disabilities

[1:50:02] <Jashter18> Woolie drones cant fly if the sky is full of lead
[1:50:09] <f0rgeman> You can shoot through deployable cover
[1:50:10] <torres_kun> So I learned you can shoot through deplorable cover, that really helps with legendary
[1:50:12] <akosinoogie> i was hoping to see Woolie off himself by attempting to shoot the Brute Shot thru the cover
[1:50:13] <dinnydanny777> Look at all this waist high cover
[1:50:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I would love a game set in the Halo universe that had that third person perspective. Maybe a squad game or something

[2:00:31] <+PhantomMiG> @woolieversus Melee is very good as it can stunlock
[2:00:31] <+Avossk_> Yo Woolie, once the brutes' armor is down you can usually kill em in 1-2 melee hits
[2:00:34] <bleugh> nyannLion
[2:00:36] <Captain_sevatar> and woolie got free ammo
[2:00:39] <+zed11111111> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug sounds about right LUL

[2:01:11] <akosinoogie> The AR is pretty baller in modded Reach campaigns tho. Vengeful Vadam's mod comes to mind
[2:01:13] <bleugh> is this part 1 of the halo lp adventure
[2:01:14] <armchairmaster_> Reach DMR is the battle rifle, but more boring
[2:01:16] <Captain_sevatar> maximum pew engaged
[2:01:16] <huskarl_zap> nah children would be more proficient

[2:03:27] <+alpacasintophats> it's why it's a JUMP pack and not a JET pack. They do not stay in the air they move places in the air. Same way Assualt Marines in 40k work

[2:03:28] <+novacrusader727> They fly now!?

[2:03:40] <Louie_Salmon> I think all the Marines just died to their own grenade
[2:03:41] <SunjammerIV> they had been flying for 70 years up to that point

[2:04:45] <BritishTyrannosaur> i like the brutes in infiinte so far. you can take off armour like in 3 but it's to slow their charges down
[2:04:45] <+zed11111111> I like that the brutes actually get spooked by seeing you. The elites dun give a fuck

[2:31:58] <ashenjuan25> Love how it played like it was super inclusive yet had some cultural errors like Pharra’s Native American skin despite her being from the Middle East region
[2:32:09] <DSD24> @MyNameIsRasus Literally everyone at IGN at the time hated that game so that's on brand for them

[2:32:31] <RedSqurrl> Pharrah's Dad was native american tho
[2:32:33] <JonOButler> shes half supposedly
[2:32:34] <%raven_frame> The Storm is going to be hype.
[2:32:39] <%dekkitout> @ashenjuan25 Pretty sure they tried to roll that back and say her dad was half indigenous people or something too
[2:32:45] <superc37> @ashenjuan25 which then caused them to retcon her being half native
[2:32:47] <+QueequegTheater> it already blew up
[2:32:50] <%FallenAngelZelos> Somewhere in this level is a mine.
[2:32:52] <+penjaza> I'm so sad they didn't blow up the phantoms
[2:33:02] <%Estuko> NotLikeThis no we lost someone
[2:33:03] <ashenjuan25> Still it was damage control and the initial skin release proves my point
[2:33:06] <BritishTyrannosaur> Tbh the tracer lesbien reveal was the only decent bit of progressiveness. even then it was 'subtle' so might as well not have happened
[2:33:09] <+Bonerlord911> why doesnt he shoot their heads
[2:33:09] <%Solidnick18> that nolan?
[2:33:11] <+smikeye> an infinite ammo turret would be real useful

[2:33:42] <ChernoMuncho> i always fought in the tunnels at this segment
[2:33:43] <%Slimshazbot> Blizzard only makes characters gay if they can use it to take attention off of them supporting an opressive dictatorship or something
[2:33:44] <The_Swedish_X> This section sucks on Legendary.
[2:33:46] <+GarboArbo> Protec the bois
[2:33:48] <Pizza_Mezza> Marines die time to restart

[3:09:27] <DinoBear_7> There are people on it in 3
[3:09:29] <Tucker0603> this one is sentient though
[3:09:32] <mean_bean1> to be fair the other ones get mini rooms
[3:09:32] <Maids4lyfe> that was boring, I liked blowing it up better
[3:09:37] <wintrysoma> because in halo 2 there was a mining scarab on delta halo for some reason
[3:09:40] <+emeraldstreak> of course woolie prefers the mech version
[3:09:45] <wintrysoma> we in the industry call this a "retcon"
[3:09:47] <%CrossCottonwood> it normally is a big deal when every enemy inside isn't already dead
[3:09:48] <%raven_frame> I prefer actually fighting the scarab, instead of it just being a set piece.

[3:14:19] <ahbhajit> I assumed there were different worm factions

[3:14:22] <+Thunder_Poo> that grunt disappeared!
[3:14:23] <%Superspider51> it's almost like an entire species was subjugated and the ones that were more loyal to the elites stuck with them while the ones who were under the brutes stayed

[3:16:19] <+TawnyMonarch> chief its 4pm, time to destroy another AA battery
[3:16:22] <+yhom_tork> the dockworkers are still here LuL

[3:16:55] <+Ropcord> we stan pistol guy
[3:16:59] <HorribleHog> in fact they would try and brawl with the aliens
[3:17:01] <%BisoromiBear> You can out-DPS the regen, so probably
[3:17:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 regarding the Grunts and Hunters seemingly switching sides, it’s more of a gameplay convenience than anything. Bungie didn’t want to get rid of 2 prominent enemy types. Story wise it’s basically, some Grunts rebelled with the Elites, others stayed with the Covvies. That’s how I see it at least
[3:17:09] <prince_johnny_> He just blew up his own brute

[3:17:20] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Grenade
[3:17:20] <%Superspider51> @ghoulishcripple yeah a lot of the things hinted at in halo 2 were just dropped entirely. The Ark was supposed to either be Earth itself or on Earth. Chief and Arby would have had more interactions etc.
[3:17:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> What could it's weak spot be? I could never guess.

[3:32:08] <+Ropcord> ignoring the brute shot makes me sad

[3:50:57] <%dekkitout> So to summarize: Woolie fought against a Children's Crusade, discovered a love of hammers, cleanses the world with a reclaiming flame, and found out the Earth is actually-- concave?

[3:51:32] <privatesargent> when the other option is the EXTINCTION OF YOUR RACE, i think you can be forgiven

[3:54:00] <alrobot2014> the 90s were wild
[3:54:01] <ashenjuan25> Mgs is pretty juvenile in how it handles mature subject matter almost worse than David cage in some instances
[3:54:01] <drewslo> kill children mod mandatory
[3:54:01] <OldOnyx> fair enough
[3:54:01] <%Chatterbox1991> you can kill kids in Deus Ex Invisible War

[3:54:17] <subjectg> Not Pathologic 2 baby
[3:54:18] <lotharrio> Tricking the pickpocket kids in Fallout 2, to stealing live bombs from you, was satisfying.
[3:54:18] <tattleworm> oh yeah, there's a whole scool in deus ex 2
[3:54:18] <@Solidus_113> There's crying zombie children in Dying Light
[3:54:18] <Dean_Inbetween> People who keep saying thaaat character is the demiurge are completely wrong and dont know the lore LUL

[3:54:22] <%DomunDomunDomun> Dante's inferno.
[3:54:23] <+Ultimate_Edge> Pathologic 2 is a year old but more importantly RUSSIAN

[3:54:31] <+NoKingArthur> Has woolie played bioshock?
[3:54:32] <Raztron> Dead Space you punt dead babies
[3:54:37] <dinnydanny777> Fallout 3 from the mid 2000s has a dead child
[3:54:37] <+brave_sj> Doesn't Bioshock let you suck the life out of small children?
[3:54:39] <The_Swedish_X> yes he has
[3:54:39] <Raztron> and shoot dead babies in 2
[3:54:40] <Halospaz117> Like some kind of challenge finder?
[3:54:41] <+whiskeybuisness> V, plasma pistol on vehicles?
[3:54:42] <%samuraihavoc> Best child killing lol
[3:54:42] <%M3djedx> woolieSPICE
[3:54:43] <ripoffproductionsllc> no sound?
[3:54:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 360 Halo 3 never had that
[3:54:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> What was the on rail shooter. Horror of "something" you could shoot kids. Shocking to see
[3:54:45] <+hermeslaflare> wools im sorry you gotta practice your driving son
[3:54:46] <crossing_mao> Happy wheels?
[3:54:48] <Gamingc00l> aw man
[3:54:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Bioshock basically lets you kill kids
[3:54:49] <wibbwobbler> i missed it! nooooo
[3:54:50] <%a_goth_pancake> lawsuit
[3:54:55] <lotharrio> Oh yeah, you can kill a LOT of kids in Bioshock 1 and 2.
[3:54:55] <crossing_mao> Or whatever it was called
[3:54:56] <dinnydanny777> There's a dead kid in Fallout 3 dude
[3:54:56] <FreedomARX7> good god the babies from dead space
[3:54:56] <%DensityD> some choppiness and some BLOOM
[3:54:58] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @brave_sj yeah but it happens off screen and is generally frowned upon
[3:54:59] <+Chillstice> When my friend launches the game there's a 50/50 that their computer will just turn off
[3:54:59] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @GarboArbo
[3:55:00] <brachydios777> It’s actually been fine
[3:55:01] <SunjammerIV> this lp is good, but i already feel nostalgic for the kotor 2 lp
[3:55:04] <+cappyd33> that fallout 2 perk woof
[3:55:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @alrobot2014 https://i.redd.it/g0fe5fnqzvox.jpg
[3:55:09] <%DensityD> briittFine
[3:55:11] <%Gruhunchously> Also, Prey (the first one)
[3:55:12] <%jorniev> SPEC OPS THE LINE you totally killed a kid
[3:55:13] <NeroInfinite> They weren't evenbabies at that point
[3:55:22] <%doomerskeletor13> I would be very surprised if Woolie hasn’t been spoiled on Bioshock
[3:55:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ODST is great tho
[3:55:25] <%spacebowie749> so to heighten the grunts are children, they eat from "food nipples" and you deffinatily killed the one playing with a doll in halo 2 when you ODST drop
[3:55:27] <alrobot2014> @LiquidDinosaur perfect
[3:55:28] <prince_johnny_> Yup
[3:55:30] <Dean_Inbetween> Masterchief is basically a kid
[3:55:30] <Halospaz117> Agreed, 3 and 2 are the top tier
[3:55:30] <%GrumbleGrouse> Halo 2 is tops tho
[3:55:31] <+whiskeybuisness> ODST MUSIC IS GOOD? SPOILERS!!!
[3:55:32] <%a_goth_pancake> my roommate and I played through ten missions with no prob, then all of a sudden her PC blue screened.
[3:55:35] <brachydios777> Halo soundtrack Kreygasm
[3:55:36] <wibbwobbler> missed the stream, did woolie enjoy the game so far?
[3:55:39] <%Slimshazbot> 3's OST is good, but not enough orignal tracks in it
[3:55:40] <%mechslayer71> @jorniev Did they rag doll the body tho?
[3:55:41] <Cykron> ODST is definitely peak music
[3:55:42] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Woolie is the reason why I got the Halo Vinyls after he talked about the P5 one years ago
[3:55:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Halo Reach is still my fave
[3:55:43] <ahbhajit> Marty is a god
[3:55:44] <@Menitta> you can kill the children in Bioshock
[3:55:46] <%dekkitout> If you count Sniper Elite, you kill tons of kids sbfpRichard
[3:55:47] <Gamingc00l> halo 2 has steve vai though
[3:55:48] <lotharrio> Sounds like Marathon.
[3:55:51] <%LastHazzerd> called it
[3:55:53] <+GarboArbo> Dead Space has ragdoll for dead babies and kids
[3:55:56] <+D00msDayDan> halo ce might as well be called marathon solid
[3:55:57] <Lieutenant_America> time is a circle
[3:55:57] <+TheIntellectional> pretty sure thats destiny
[3:55:58] <Dean_Inbetween> @woolieversus hey little v favorite halo song?
[3:55:58] <%DensityD> OBJECTION
[3:56:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah Halo is basically Marathon 2.0
[3:56:01] <TheDugness> if I'm not mistaken you can kill children and participate in slave trading in fallout 2
[3:56:01] <Halospaz117> I gotta play Marathon at some point
[3:56:02] <+GarboArbo> You kill them
[3:56:05] <Raztron> Rampancy is a important thing in Bungie games
[3:56:05] <brachydios777> Bungie loves recycling
[3:56:05] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[3:56:06] <%GrumbleGrouse> they must
[3:56:08] <Halospaz117> COVENANT MCDONALDS
[3:56:08] <mamobelty> Not a spoiler, but fun fact thats easy to miss. In that scene in the hanger. You can see that the elites and marines are switching weaponry. The elites trade their carbine rifles because they are lighter in weight, And the marines trade their heavy weaponry like rockets and turrets to the Elites. However, this concept does not appear in the gameplay.

[3:56:31] <f0rgeman> Food nipple
[3:56:31] <BubbaGAN0USH> we could try LUL
[3:56:33] <%GrumbleGrouse> space communitarianism
[3:56:34] <%doomerskeletor13> I would assume any corporations are state owned
[3:56:35] <Lieutenant_America> tell that to Chik fil A
[3:56:36] <%fugatlas> it does when the religion owns the shops
[3:56:38] <+GarboArbo> Food Nipple
[3:56:38] <+maenos2> brutes got a dining hall at least and they eat a LOT of things
[3:56:40] <superc37> food nipples

[3:56:42] <Divryne> FOOD NIPPLE.
[3:56:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> the grunts have a whole industry around selling bootleg human soap operas
[3:56:45] <huskarl_zap> The vatican is a corporation and a state
[3:56:46] <Oscarthemowerman> you don't need food you have jesus :)
[3:56:48] <zashrin777> food nipple
[3:56:48] <+brave_sj> Grunts have food nipples
[3:56:49] <Speccu_> Jackals are the only real capitalistic covenant species the rest are very feudal @WoolieVersus
[3:56:49] <UvBenServed> You eat what you can find
[3:56:49] <+Bonerlord911> FOOD NIPPLE
[3:56:51] <%Tuna_Can_0> Whose to say they even have taste buds
[3:56:51] <%DensityD> good god, we all love the food nipple
[3:56:52] <f0rgeman> F O O D NI P P L E
[3:56:52] <Zohare> They are a religious military
[3:56:52] <+Aheg0d> too religious for capitalism
[3:56:53] <@Menitta> I'd assume they hunt
[3:56:54] <+Squibo> Food Nipple
[3:56:54] <ripoffproductionsllc> Grunts have their Food Nipples
[3:56:55] <%Solidnick18> i'd love it
[3:56:56] <%jorniev> EAT THE GRUNTS
[3:56:56] <%Gruhunchously> Food Nipples
[3:56:57] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> McDonalds actually introduced their first location on High Charity in 2543
[3:56:57] <dailylifewithry> FOOD NIPPLE
[3:56:58] <Captain_sevatar> Lekgolo Legumes
[3:57:00] <%BisoromiBear> eat next to the melty tourney
[3:57:00] <%Ozmodyas> Guessing it's good stuff for the Prophets and shit for everyone else
[3:57:00] <Goraka91> I mean Middle Eastern food is pretty good
[3:57:00] <Dean_Inbetween> Capitalism has no place in a theocracy
[3:57:01] <%tyler274> F O O D N I P P L E
[3:57:01] <scrumbotime> Food Nipple
[3:57:02] <%Harthhammer> Brutes just grab a random grunt when hungry Keepo
[3:57:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Well it’s probably a one market capitalist type thing where the religion controls all business
[3:57:04] <+Bonerlord911> but CAN chief go blankie mode?
[3:57:04] <%Solidnick18> need me one of those
[3:57:04] <+brave_sj> You had bad feeling about morning food nipple
[3:57:04] <+Squibo> big grunty thirst
[3:57:05] <Shardlab> Two words: Food Nipple
[3:57:05] <ghoulishcripple> food nipple
[3:57:06] <%fugatlas> the bird people are only in the covenant because theyre getting paid, so there has to be some level of capitalism
[3:57:08] <letshavecakes> Go to the bathroom and eat some nutrients bro
[3:57:09] <%DesDavis> Do the covenant have memes?
[3:57:11] <%GrumbleGrouse> Dem Tasty Nips
[3:57:13] <%JohnAtDawn> RIGHT
[3:57:14] <ThatGuyThere03> We talking about that BIG GRUNTY THIRST?
[3:57:17] <Torivore> The protein trough
[3:57:21] <ashenjuan25> You’d be surprised V
[3:57:24] <wibbwobbler> THE GREAT JOURNEY
[3:57:24] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Not hDMI compatible
[3:57:28] <@Menitta> Its probably messy with that elite mouth
[3:57:32] <letshavecakes> There were cameras in the throne room in high charity
[3:57:32] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> SPACE HDMI
[3:57:33] <%DensityD> the Kig' Yar have the dankest memes
[3:57:34] <Captain_sevatar> Hunters are definitely high in protein
[3:57:37] <+portlandsunshine> All Covenant industry is controlled by the various ministries.
[3:57:38] <$serpenttucker> Complex fart cloud tech
[3:57:38] <CalderGaming> like for a species that doesn't see in the same part of the EM spectrum
[3:57:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Don’t Grunts pirate human entertainment?
[3:57:42] <wibbwobbler> man of steel was silly
[3:57:45] <twoah> Pull up to the drive thru on your wraith like “lemme get uuuhhhhh”
[3:57:50] <BossFountain> In Stellaris, you discover a long lost race that communicated via smell
[3:57:52] <%DensityD> memes from the Kig yar are super dark and racist
[3:57:52] <Raztron> Prophets keep all the good shit
[3:57:52] <Oscarthemowerman> in halo 2 there was a camera in the throne scene where MC teleports in
[3:57:52] <brachydios777> I imagine Elites have to look up when they eat
[3:57:54] <Dean_Inbetween> The elite have food that are easier to consume based on the mouth shapes
[3:58:00] <letshavecakes> Those shitty holograms are probably the covenant equivalent of black & white tv
[3:58:09] <Raztron> Star Trek holodeck porn and entertainment
[3:58:12] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @DensityD Kig Yar youtube be like "STERILIZING ALL UNGGOY PRANK (GONE WRONG)"
[3:58:12] <+maenos2> grunt: "yeah can i get Two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda."
[3:58:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah Halo 2 has those cameras the Prophets we’re talking to
[3:58:18] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 little shocked Woolie somehow doesnt know this but Deus Ex: Invisible War (the og xbox version at least) totally lets you kill children; there's an entire school in Egypt filled with 10 year old arabic kids that you can murder with absolutely zero repercussions except from a single piece of scolding dialogue over the headset.
[3:58:30] <+Bonerlord911> https://clips.twitch.tv/ResilientExpensiveHawkOSsloth
[3:58:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's a neat idea
[3:58:42] <Afterman_> something with king arthur related im sure
[3:58:42] <+Vibe__Lord> Star wars?
[3:58:53] <AmericanaRed> HARRY POTTER
[3:58:54] <+portlandsunshine> OH fuck Woolz that's a super dope idea
[3:58:56] <$serpenttucker> Complex fart gasses shaped like an image
[3:58:58] <@Solidus_113> Invisible War came out in 2003
[3:58:58] <+Freeborg1997> @Chatterbox1991 O_o
[3:59:02] <%DensityD> it's all Bibble Games
[3:59:05] <%Chatterbox1991> YEAH I KNOW
[3:59:07] <BritishTyrannosaur> Elite's do poetry so i picture sanghelli JK rowling somewhere
[3:59:07] <Dean_Inbetween> Also covenant technology hasnt proggressed too much considering there technology was all adopted and reverse enginneered
[3:59:08] <%GrumbleGrouse> Vai is NOT butt rock
[3:59:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Halo 3 theme is class
[3:59:23] <%GrumbleGrouse> Incubus tho... but rock

[3:59:35] <letshavecakes> Oh right, MCC doesn't have credits, you guys missed John Mayer playing 2's end theme
[3:59:37] <Halospaz117> Halo is great with that stuff
[3:59:42] <Reisadan> Oy guvs and gavs
[3:59:47] <Raztron> actuall research and reverse engineering is Heresy

[4:00:07] <%threeheadedwalrus> Buttrock Benjamin?
[4:00:08] <+Bonerlord911> @WoolieVersus it was a spiker not a mauler
[4:00:09] <%Chatterbox1991> i started with 2
[4:00:09] <%jiggy_snipe> starting with Rising is fine
[4:00:12] <%GrumbleGrouse> INCUBUS TOO. BUTT ROCK
[4:00:12] <%RyTYoung> Is a spin off so it's cool
[4:00:13] <%Tuna_Can_0> same
[4:00:13] <%Solidnick18> Breaking buttrock
[4:00:15] <@Menitta> I started there
[4:00:17] <+emeraldstreak> Raiden Gaiden
[4:00:17] <Raztron> Spin offs are Fine
[4:00:18] <+Grayhammatter> gudin' raiden
[4:00:19] <+GarboArbo> Rising is the gateway drug
[4:00:20] <%a_goth_pancake> OOOOONLY THE STRONGEST WILL SURVIIIIVE
[4:00:20] <BubbaGAN0USH> there's nothing wrong with starting with mgr LUL
[4:00:21] <wibbwobbler> breaking Benjamin is unironically the best
[4:00:22] <Dean_Inbetween> Considering elites are a very conservative warrior culture i doubt an author like rowling could exist in there society
[4:00:23] <Raztron> thats always been the case
[4:00:26] <@Menitta> MGS2 is much better as a result
[4:00:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> kinda spoils aspects of 4 though
[4:00:28] <%Gruhunchously> Ninja Raiden
[4:00:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Raiden Gaiden?
[4:00:30] <+GarboArbo> I like BB
[4:00:32] <%DensityD> Jetstream Sam
[4:00:35] <%Javaa01> Rising is fine to get in on, it's out there enough that you can accept it without knowing the answers
[4:00:37] <ashenjuan25> Didn’t Nile Rodgers work on halo 2 ost?
[4:00:41] <+brave_sj> "THE PATRIOTS PLANTED THE SEEDS" "Who?"

[4:00:51] <+Bonerlord911> JUST PLAY IT IN RELEASE ORDER
[4:00:52] <%doomerskeletor13> I know people who played Red Dead 2 first and then went into RDR 1 and still enjoyed it
[4:00:55] <%shoutofthehobo> @woolieversus I think The Wheel of time did a portal over a battlefield as to help direct troops
[4:00:55] <%cowardman93> I started at MGS2
[4:00:55] <%krispen_wa> WHAT
[4:00:55] <subjectg> Revengeance is cool but i don’t see it as a proper sequel to mgs2
[4:00:58] <%GrumbleGrouse> MGS3 is a good start point
[4:00:58] <%jorniev> YES
[4:00:59] <ripoffproductionsllc> MGS3 is okay due to timeline placement
[4:01:01] <+Neoripo> Buttcrack Benjamin
[4:01:04] <%krispen_wa> Revengeance backtracks on MGS4

[4:01:47] <dinnydanny777> Suicide bombers
[4:01:47] <correctedsun117> SINGLE CHILD TEAR
[4:01:48] <huskarl_zap> In this game the grunts say "My kids cant get methane because of you demon."
[4:01:51] <Louie_Salmon> Isn't there a skull that causes a bunch of random dialogue to happen?
[4:01:54] <%jorniev> GOD
[4:01:55] <%kyh9> GIVE US A GRUNT PARTY MEMBER
[4:01:57] <%DensityD> COMMIT. TO. THE BIT.
[4:01:58] <%spacebowie749> so to heighten the grunts are children, they eat from "food nipples" and you deffinatily killed the one playing with a doll in halo 2 when you ODST drop woolieMIRIN
[4:02:00] <Raztron> just as bad as the covenant calling Grunts children
[4:02:00] <subjectg> You can even get that effect for Reach and it’s the best
[4:02:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Raztron yes, they look smaller because Master Cheif is like 7 foot tall
[4:02:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Grunts are so sad man
[4:02:01] <letshavecakes> Oh that explanation actually makes it sad
[4:02:01] <%BisoromiBear> good boy unggoys
[4:02:01] <Captain_sevatar> Yeah technically the spartans are child soldiers so it kinda cancels out

[4:02:53] <dailylifewithry> I don’t think all grunts joined the brutes, halo 5 has a bunch on the elite’s side

[4:02:54] <+Bonerlord911> the brutes get redesigned in EVERY GAME

[4:03:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh that stupid DBZ cartoon
[4:03:48] <ashenjuan25> This is something I do kinda like 5 covenant lore addresses

[4:03:50] <%Tearonex> Tearonex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey Woolz and V, glad to see you're finishing the fight, speaking of which just beat Hades in Hades for the first time today, any chance when you'll be taking a look when the full game drops? (AKA. the next update)
[4:03:53] <%Ancopro> legends is fanon tho
[4:03:54] <Halospaz117> 1337 is fucking great, I love him
[4:03:55] <idiotscampaign> 2008 ish?

[4:03:57] <+brave_sj> Post Halo 3
[4:03:58] <%jorniev> THAT GUY IS AWESOME
[4:04:00] <Captain_sevatar> leet speak was in full swing back then
[4:04:04] <@Solidus_113> 2010
[4:04:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> 1337 was slapstick AF
[4:04:07] <Oscarthemowerman> 2010
[4:04:09] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Doesn't Hood say they glassed the continent?
[4:04:10] <+Buzzkill983> 1337 is full anime
[4:04:11] <SpaceGuntank> that movie series was SO GOOD
[4:04:14] <%Tearonex> 1337 is the DBZ Spartan LUL
[4:04:14] <ashenjuan25> Blue blutes?
[4:04:15] <%Gruhunchously> Life is Strange: Before the Storm did a 1337 joke. In 2017.
[4:04:16] <%fugatlas> Has V talked about Mister Chief at all
[4:04:21] <DesertPenguin> He's staying topical
[4:04:21] <Dean_Inbetween> They glassed half of africa
[4:04:22] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie definitely won't play Halo infinite, he doesn't play new games
[4:04:32] <Raztron> Hood says they tried and wanted to glass the whole thing
[4:04:33] <black_pariah> @Reverend_Roscoe he was vastly exaggerating
[4:04:33] <ripoffproductionsllc> will he be cought up by then?
[4:04:33] <penitentpentwitch> ...so has V played Dead Space?
[4:04:34] <+Neoripo> E Shit on Pat
[4:04:35] <%GrumbleGrouse> So when do the white people steal all the glass in africa for their jewelry?
[4:04:35] <%DensityD> donut
[4:04:36] <Captain_sevatar> Well I am so glad you chose to play em
[4:04:37] <unclekulikov> the moment was right
[4:04:39] <prime_name> It's like smash bros criteria
[4:04:40] <+portlandsunshine> 1337 isn't canon
[4:04:42] <%jiggy_snipe> he might play Infinite just not on release
[4:04:42] <NeroInfinite> Clearly you ahven't seen play doom
[4:04:44] <Dean_Inbetween> AAND shit on pat
[4:04:44] <brachydios777> @dean_inbetween Gotta be sure
[4:04:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Louie_Salmon Ghosts of Tsushima tho
[4:04:47] <+CyanDeadEye> @Reverend_Roscoe "Half a continent" but he was exaggerating
[4:04:48] <+Reverend_Roscoe> says who?
[4:04:50] <+GarboArbo> Dead Space ye?
[4:04:52] <%DensityD> infinitely dunk on patrick boivin
[4:04:54] <Cykron> He said DROP guys!!
[4:04:54] <+GarboArbo> When?
[4:04:55] <Shibito117> I hope I didn't miss to much. This is my first time finally catching the Woolie show live.
[4:04:56] <%dekkitout> @McGwinnus Bravo Clap
[4:04:57] <%Tearonex> 1337 is canon to me dammit
[4:04:59] <%cowardman93> also considering ODST is out next month and Halo 4 will be out soon then Infinite coming out this year, it's kinda Halo year
[4:05:01] <undercoverbarber> I stopped at 4
[4:05:02] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> @louie_salmon He played Ghost of Tsushima

[4:05:32] <+GarboArbo> lol
[4:05:32] <Louie_Salmon> He had to be sent a box with weeb shit to play Ghost of Tsushima
[4:05:34] <wibbwobbler> he needs help
[4:05:35] <Djinnazz> THere is no old Kanye
[4:05:36] <prince_johnny_> Both
[4:05:36] <%DensityD> KANYE IS A TROLL, BUT HE HAS GONE LEGIT INSANE
[4:05:38] <brachydios777> Oh boy
[4:05:45] <Djinnazz> it's always just been Kayne
[4:05:45] <drugbustincat> Damn cant say the same to me Halo is so infeuential to me, every year I think about that shit. Building a PC litcherally just to play the collection
[4:05:47] <+facenorway> He's gonna release an album soon
[4:05:49] <DesertPenguin> He's Bipolar
[4:05:51] <brachydios777> We all miss old Kanye
[4:05:52] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Kanye has mental health issues and no one around him cares about him enough to help him
[4:05:53] <prime_name> Rosa Parks didn't doo nothin, says Kanye
[4:05:53] <%JohnAtDawn> The man has actual mental illness
[4:05:54] <Dean_Inbetween> I think kanye is actually bipolar
[4:05:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> He actually needs help. I hope he gets it
[4:06:02] <%jiggy_snipe> yea it's part of the rollout for an album or apparel
[4:06:03] <Raztron> is the car crash just catching up to Kanye?
[4:06:04] <AmericanaRed> POPPY DI SCOOP
[4:06:10] <+AcidHues> Kanye trying to bring attention
[4:06:12] <%DensityD> a gig
[4:06:14] <Raztron> didnt that almost kill him right before he got big?
[4:06:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> auteur
[4:06:17] <%Chatterbox1991> he's a legitimately talented artist too, which is tragic
[4:06:18] <phantalime> how far in did woolie get today?
[4:06:18] <brachydios777> He needs soft and tough love to bring him back to reality
[4:06:23] <rsg220> V is a dashing minstrel
[4:06:24] <%DensityD> THE SUITS RUN THE SHOW
[4:06:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> He's Bipolar and stops his meds to do the music, and then gets crazy.
[4:06:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 speaking of starting points for series, I know someone who started Red Dead Redemption 2 first and then did 1, and the story flows really nicely. I know Ray Narvaez did Yakuza 0 first and it flowed well into the first game for him. That’s the exception to the rule though, usually release order is better. Keep being awesome guys
[4:06:29] <%krispen_wa> Normally yeah, he makes controversy for cash, but it seems almost legit now
[4:06:35] <Djinnazz> Good managment????
[4:06:41] <ghoulishcripple> Kanye scammed the state to get a bill passed. that's baller
[4:06:41] <%mechslayer71> That Harriet Tubman comment sure gonna sell copies huh woolie? @woolieversus

[4:07:00] <%jorniev> HE IS BIPOLAR!?
[4:07:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Never stan rich people
[4:07:03] <%Solidnick18> they are pretty nuts
[4:07:03] <Raztron> yea but still
[4:07:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> And lots of money
[4:07:06] <prince_johnny_> Truth
[4:07:07] <%DensityD> N+ pass is a vibe, an experience, it's a movement

[4:07:31] <%jorniev> DEPRESSION IS FUCKED

[4:07:43] <%doomerskeletor13> The problem is that being an asshole is tolerated as long as they make money

[4:07:47] <%DensityD> britney spears' dad
[4:07:47] <%krispen_wa> Jesus
[4:07:52] <%Solidnick18> sometimes you can abuse them too
[4:07:52] <dinnydanny777> Alternatively, take drugs to be creative
[4:07:54] <black_pariah> plenty of creatives take their meds and are fine, this is a bullshit argument

[4:09:17] <Raztron> Woolie heard about the stuff with Terry Crews lol
[4:09:21] <dreadedcthulhu> pedos and predators galore in the indie scene
[4:09:32] <ahbhajit> Watch the Throne is also good
[4:09:37] <PettyFunk> Also everything about Joe Jackson's long history of child abuse and extortion
[4:09:37] <%NovaKnightmare> I fucked up my message lmao
[4:09:39] <%Chatterbox1991> Love Lockdown is great tho
[4:09:41] <+hermeslaflare> kanye has lived long enough to become the villain
[4:09:42] <+LCGOV> 808s influenced the 10's rap/hip hop
[4:09:46] <%KineKithZen> Top 40 has only become more repetitive
[4:09:46] <+armor_kuma> Theres a few
[4:09:49] <penitentpentwitch> Halo 2 had bosses
[4:09:49] <@Solidus_113> Will.i.am ruined auto tune
[4:09:52] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> halo has a bunch of bosses
[4:09:53] <Raztron> the scarab tank is pretty much a boss
[4:09:54] <%Solidnick18> the end of 2
[4:09:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> Its more of gauntlets then bosses
[4:09:56] <+Ropcord> scarabs kind of count
[4:09:56] <penitentpentwitch> Scarab has a boss
[4:09:57] <Halospaz117> Halo 2 did, but that's it really
[4:09:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dreadedcthulhu
[4:09:57] <prime_name> Tartarus was kinda a boss
[4:09:57] <subjectg> @estuko basically just means to support and fanboy people, but i could be misunderstanding it myself
[4:09:58] <undercoverbarber> F'ed Up Beyond All Repair
[4:09:59] <BritishTyrannosaur> halo wars 2 had good bosses
[4:09:59] <dinnydanny777> Jason Derulo ruined auto tune
[4:10:01] <%doomerskeletor13> 2 had some
[4:10:01] <%krispen_wa> Tartar Sauce
[4:10:01] <penitentpentwitch> *is a boss
[4:10:02] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 2 and thats it
[4:10:02] <Raztron> Tarturus monkey man is a boss in 2
[4:10:05] <%GrumbleGrouse> BIOSHOCK
[4:10:07] <%falyden> stream over?
[4:10:09] <%Javaa01> They have bosses in the 343 era of games, and they all suck ass
[4:10:11] <+DreyfussFrost> It's difficult to do a "boss" in the genre.
[4:10:11] <brachydios777> Not many, which is probably for the best
[4:10:12] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Dean_Inbetween halo 3 has a boss too
[4:10:12] <Halospaz117> Depends on the shooter, but yeah
[4:10:13] <%Chatterbox1991> @Solidus_113 nice url :O
[4:10:13] <@Menitta> Titanfall 2 has bosses
[4:10:14] <+BusinessGiraffe> halo 3 had the big ol spider thing you shoot with rockets
[4:10:15] <%NovaKnightmare> Doom brought em back recently
[4:10:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Halo Reach doesn’t really iirc
[4:10:16] <+greatgetter> All the ones in the 90's ones had loads
[4:10:17] <+Bonerlord911> halo 2 flirted with the concept, people didnt like it
[4:10:17] <DoubleKK64> Doom and Wolfenstein are the best examples of FPS bosses
[4:10:17] <Saltmeisterr> its hard to do good shooter bosses
[4:10:18] <subjectg> @estuko almost like hero worship really
[4:10:19] <dinnydanny777> Bosses tend to be massive amounts of enemies
[4:10:20] <CurrySauseBandit> Borderlands has a lot of bosses
[4:10:27] <+Aeoneth> `FPS's have very few Boss worthy mechanics in my experiecce
[4:10:31] <Decimated_body> Mbdtf is a 6/10 to me \:-?\)
[4:10:32] <DatAsuna> It's cause your mobiity and defensive options are rarely good for an extended 1 vs 1
[4:10:34] <brachydios777> I would say they do mini bosses better like the Scarabs
[4:10:39] <%Ancopro> b o o k
[4:10:40] <+GarboArbo> mmm
[4:10:40] <Halospaz117> OH JESUS
[4:10:41] <Wyldesquirrel> hope woolz loves the choppers
[4:10:41] <dinnydanny777> Just like John.
[4:10:46] <%Solidnick18> not long
[4:10:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:10:47] <AMaidIndeed> Titanfall 2 and Doom 2016 has the most bosses I've seen in an fps
[4:10:47] <%DensityD> dogs

[4:10:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Fuck
[4:10:50] <Dean_Inbetween> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug are you talking about scarabs? Or am I blanking because if were counting them reach has a scarab
[4:10:52] <PettyFunk> We don't know 'cause you won't let them die of old age :(
[4:10:52] <%BisoromiBear> nobody knows, they don't live to old age
[4:10:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> probably like 15 or 20

[4:23:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Doomguy and John Halo should hang out
[4:23:16] <+LCGOV> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Halo Wars is on PC and XBONE I believe
[4:23:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> THATS HOW HE GETS YA WOOLZ
[4:23:18] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind is an Eldritch being
[4:23:23] <Lieutenant_America> That's fair.
[4:23:26] <%doomerskeletor13> He was pretty spooky tho
[4:23:27] <%dekkitout> With Samus too @lewdskeletor13
[4:23:28] <%DensityD> the Bungie writers know how to properly introduce the baddie
[4:23:30] <prince_johnny_> Yea
[4:23:33] <powerprotoman> So when are we getting to DOA4?
[4:23:36] <+GarboArbo> He tells you the truth
[4:23:37] <brachydios777> Bungie was smart about the Gravemind
[4:23:42] <subjectg> That’s how he gets to you, he’s charismatic and cunning
[4:23:44] <%krispen_wa> Gravemind used his CHA 10 to brainwash Woolie
[4:23:44] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @LCGOV oh shit time for an impromptu replay of halo wars PogChamp
[4:23:46] <+GarboArbo> He a real one
[4:23:49] <+GarboArbo> sometimes
[4:23:50] <DatAsuna> didn't read like one
[4:23:55] <+Bonerlord911> events suck
[4:24:00] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind just wants peace
[4:24:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> The biggest evil opens up with diplomacy and making perfect sense, but OOPS ALL EVIL CHARISMA
[4:24:04] <dinnydanny777> Like he said
[4:24:04] <wibbwobbler> he chose to be manipulative instead of totally menacing
[4:24:05] <brachydios777> He technically has never lied to you
[4:24:08] <Torivore> Halo Wars 1 and 2 are on pc
[4:24:10] <Captain_sevatar> Become one with the gravemind
[4:24:12] <%DensityD> I want red lantern's on the silver screen
[4:24:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Secret Wars by Jonathan Hickman
[4:24:22] <$serpenttucker> Killing joke Kappa
[4:24:23] <%kyh9> I want one good, accurate Dark Phoenix adaptation.
[4:24:24] <DatAsuna> often the animated version sucks
[4:24:25] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind wants to end all wars
[4:24:26] <BritishTyrannosaur> Hickman is god
[4:24:28] <%DensityD> HATE AND REVENGE AND BLOOD RRRRAAAAAGGGHGHHGHR
[4:24:29] <emeraldskrull> for me I want civil war but actually good. Too bad that ship has sailed.
[4:24:31] <%jorniev> JONNA HEX BULLIES THE BAD GUY
[4:24:32] <%kyh9> I JUST WANT DARK PHOENIX TO GET ITS DUE GODDMANIT
[4:24:33] <+hermeslaflare> Whenever the flood shows up I hear the Ultra Instinct theme in my head
[4:24:35] <Lieutenant_America> He is a timeless chorus. Join your voice with his and sing victory, everlasting!
[4:24:40] <%krispen_wa> Look, gravemind is like entropy. It'll happen anyways, so why not become part of the hivemind so we can all become one
[4:24:40] <$jake5713> I still want Secret Invasion.
[4:24:41] <Raztron> it was so Bad
[4:24:48] <prime_name> wOW
[4:24:51] <DatAsuna> killing joke was bad even at the stuff it didn't change just because of how much less detail they drew
[4:24:51] <%Tuna_Can_0> for what its worth Nihilanth was a fugative
[4:24:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1287839400034996227?s=20
[4:24:51] <DesertPenguin> Comics are hard to keep up with
[4:24:57] <DesertPenguin> The movies are entertaining but they lack the details
[4:24:57] <Captain_sevatar> Hard Agree
[4:24:58] <%kyh9> True, it's good to leave comics as they are
[4:24:59] <%krispen_wa> God the Killing Joke adaptation sucked
[4:24:59] <+doctordunno> On the flipside, Civil War the movie was better than Civil War the comic line
[4:25:03] <prime_name> Big Agree
[4:25:06] <%DensityD> slippery agree
[4:25:08] <Shardlab> Good on ya, Woolie
[4:25:08] <Halospaz117> I think it's because movies are what get the most attention from the mainstream, other than TV
[4:25:10] <%BisoromiBear> all the shitty movies have killed any interest
[4:25:12] <%doomerskeletor13> House of X breebuPog very good
[4:25:15] <DatAsuna> When's the movie of jack at the end of the world?
[4:25:17] <GarbageNirvana> Alan Moore is right
[4:25:22] <DesertPenguin> "If you get a movie, you're good"
[4:25:25] <PettyFunk> Never ever ever
[4:25:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Immortal Hulk is pretty poggers too
[4:25:26] <Captain_sevatar> saga?
[4:25:26] <Shardlab> Saga is fine how it is
[4:25:28] <%dekkitout> Almost anything current X-men is cool
[4:25:36] <brachydios777> Heroes in Crisis kinda proves how messy continuity can be
[4:25:37] <%Solidnick18> something will eventually
[4:25:38] <wibbwobbler> berserk irl
[4:25:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Sah-ga
[4:25:39] <lotharrio> I could see an Invincible adaptation.
[4:25:40] <+wunp_fxs> fuck no with Vagabond
[4:25:41] <%DensityD> Bill Watterson FORBIDS the use of his characters to be shown in any other way
[4:25:43] <Cygnar527> Any news on Saga 55?
[4:25:44] <Shardlab> Saga is an indie science fantasy comic
[4:25:44] <+wunp_fxs> CAnt beat that art
[4:25:47] <+doctordunno> As with any sort of remake/adaptation, I think it's more interesting to remake/adapt something that had interesting concepts but bad execution than trying to recapture the magic of something that's already really good
[4:25:48] <@Solidus_113> I wanna see Scott Pilgrim done in different mediums
[4:25:49] <Baziiiinga> What's "Saga" saga of what?
[4:25:51] <ISkyHunterI> vagabong gacha game when ? Kappa

[4:25:55] <Shardlab> You may be able to animate it, but that's it
[4:25:55] <Reisadan> Musashi is an awesome book in itself
[4:25:58] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is saga?
[4:25:59] <f0rgeman> Vinland saga>
[4:26:03] <Shardlab> Saga does not need a movie
[4:26:05] <$serpenttucker> Gwenpool would FUCKING SUCK as a movie, but might be okay as a TV show
[4:26:08] <ISkyHunterI> @Baziiiinga just saga it is a sci fi comic book
[4:26:11] <%krispen_wa> PICKLE PROTOCOL

[4:31:11] <Halospaz117> 2 is a prequel
[4:31:11] <Phort909> I loved RDR2
[4:31:12] <+doctordunno> I honestly think Zero is a better starting place than Kiwami, despite kiwami ostensibly being a remake of the first game
[4:31:14] <%Solidnick18> yeah but play 2 first cause it's a pre qual
[4:31:15] <Shardlab> Red Dead 2 is a bit of a trip
[4:31:16] <brachydios777> It’s a prequel
[4:31:16] <+JeluxDaCasual> Two-Tapping those Toddlers
[4:31:19] <%RyTYoung> Revolver is the most stand-alone
[4:31:20] <wibbwobbler> rdr2 adds to it. brilliant
[4:31:22] <%dekkitout> Was the news about rdr2's enhanced edition being slower horses a parody?
[4:31:25] <Captain_sevatar> Sucker Punch put most of their dev dollars into their open world with Tsushima and it really showed
[4:31:26] <Shardlab> Red Dead 2 makes you take a while
[4:31:26] <emeraldskrull> Uncle is the protag in revolver!
[4:31:26] <+brave_sj> 2 is a prequel to 1
[4:31:27] <ShadowForceX75> one is after 2 same guy
[4:31:28] <lotharrio> Revolver is its own thing. Redemption 2 is a prequel to Redemption 1.
[4:31:30] <ashenjuan25> Rdr1 is better going in order for dramatic irony tho and if you know rdr1 the rdr2 epilogue is made better for knowing the first game tbh
[4:31:33] <+BigBlackBankai> Just do it
[4:31:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Tsushima is great, but my map scraping has almost maxed out everything, so the dopamine trickle is starting to slow.
[4:31:43] <@Menitta> Its arguably better to start at 0 than the PS2 games because Yakuza 1 on PS2 is not great all things considered and jumping from the remakes to 3 is not that jarring
[4:31:45] <+Kyma1020> 2’s a prequel
[4:31:47] <%koolaid_kevster> RDR2 is a continuation opf some sort but its actullyt a prequel
[4:31:48] <asd2897> how I got into comics tbh
[4:31:51] <ashenjuan25> Revolver is shit
[4:31:54] <+wunp_fxs> oh god
[4:31:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:31:55] <+brave_sj> RDR2 ends at the beginning of 1
[4:32:03] <%DappercatEsquire> that sounds fun
[4:32:04] <%koolaid_kevster> AYE
[4:32:05] <ChernoMuncho> i didnt like rd1 after playing rd2 first
[4:32:10] <hkgamingtv> rdr2 is a prequel
[4:32:11] <brachydios777> LUL LUL
[4:32:13] <AmericanaRed> Started GTA at Bully
[4:32:15] <asd2897> its not hard to figure it out and modern stuff will remind you whats important
[4:32:15] <DatAsuna> Alternate timelines be that way
[4:32:16] <ASleepySnek> prequel
[4:32:17] <blizzagan> @ashenjuan25 just like you \:-?\)
[4:32:17] <%dekkitout> Who's this Cooler Guy? Wait- Vegeta had a kid?
[4:32:18] <+FennecZephyr> Yeah they dont
[4:32:23] <Torivore> Yakuza 4 was the one that had the recap to catch people up, right?
[4:32:26] <+FennecZephyr> There's no time for it to take place
[4:32:30] <%doomerskeletor13> yeah RDR2 is 12 years before 1
[4:32:31] <ashenjuan25> Still think red dead in order is the best way to play the series imo
[4:32:32] <Djinnazz> ???
[4:32:32] <%koolaid_kevster> RD1 is good in its own right but rdr2 is better in everyway
[4:32:39] <%Ancopro> yup
[4:32:40] <floornine> What’s with dudes being named Eric being shits? There’s Eric Trump, Eric Sparrow, Eric Cartman, Prince Eric from Little Mermaid (married an underage girl)
[4:32:42] <%emperordread> Is it still called Kamehameha in french? Or do they put weird punctuation on it?
[4:32:42] <ashenjuan25> Debatable
[4:32:44] <%jorniev> ME TOOOD THAT IS TERRIBLE
[4:32:47] <%Tuna_Can_0> wait what?
[4:32:47] <ashenjuan25> Rdr1 is a better game
[4:32:48] <+wunp_fxs> LUL
[4:32:51] <DatAsuna> ooooh canadian dubs lol
[4:32:52] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:32:53] <%jorniev> VENEZUELA
[4:32:53] <ashenjuan25> Rdr2 has a better story
[4:32:55] <+BigBlackBankai> RDR then 2 then RDR again rinse repeat
[4:32:56] <%dekkitout> The Namek saga on Toonami was a constant GER
[4:32:57] <Dean_Inbetween> That happened on toonami too
[4:32:58] <hkgamingtv> woolie got me into yakuza
[4:33:02] <time_axis> it's like the endless 8
[4:33:02] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:33:03] <alrobot2014> that sounds like the worst kind of time loop
[4:33:03] <Ynkubus_> Then they migt just stop getting the rest of the series leaving you with half a story
[4:33:04] <BlackermanZX> LUL i hate that
[4:33:05] <%cowardman93> oh god fuck that
[4:33:05] <%Tearonex> One Piece Stampede is the most ridiculous version of "when would this have happened"
[4:33:06] <+wunp_fxs> omfg
[4:33:07] <FrostedZaibatsu> LUL Im back again bitch
[4:33:08] <%doomerskeletor13> RDR2 is one of my fave games so I’m very biased
[4:33:09] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @BubbaGAN0USH (warning)
[4:33:13] <%krispen_wa> LUL these Canadians
[4:33:13] <asd2897> frieza looped forever
[4:33:16] <+JeluxDaCasual> not even
[4:33:18] <Sol_Install> huh
[4:33:19] <alrobot2014> @time_axis at least camera angles and clothes changed in endless 8
[4:33:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> GOLD EXPERIENCE REQUIEM
[4:33:21] <lotharrio> Then it takes a month or two before you get a new episode.
[4:33:21] <AmericanaRed> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis FLASHBACKS
[4:33:23] <%Irridium> jesus LUL
[4:33:23] <emeraldskrull> for me it was goku arriving on namek, taking out Reccome and then they start over
[4:33:23] <+wjones0415> dear god frieza!
[4:33:27] <Dean_Inbetween> That happened in the states as well but it always restarted at namek with us @woolieversus
[4:33:28] <DatAsuna> Here that only really happened with simpsons, which wasn't a problem lol
[4:33:28] <undercoverbarber> TOONAMI PogChamp
[4:33:30] <wibbwobbler> wtf dude
[4:33:30] <Xanax44> bite za dusto
[4:33:32] <%jorniev> THAT HAPPENED TO ME WITH SAMURAI CHAMPLOO
[4:33:34] <+Exicuren> OR WORSE, Goku going SSJ and then Back to Raditz
[4:33:35] <Captain_sevatar> YTV got up to some bullshit
[4:33:37] <brachydios777> LUL
[4:33:38] <DoubleKK64> NEXT EPISODE: FRIEZA DEFEATED
[4:33:38] <floornine> Never forget how Bardock was a brilliant scientist
[4:33:39] <+JeluxDaCasual> Gohan getting his shit kicked my be Reccome, then back to Raditz
[4:33:41] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[4:33:44] <%paladinstarbuster> thats why those exist?
[4:33:45] <Shardlab> We got to Riccomb getting killed and then it restarted from Raditz.
[4:33:45] <PettyFunk> Somewhat related, but why did The Great Divide play so many times when A:TLA was airing
[4:33:47] <prime_name> That'
[4:33:49] <%LordSDB> Yeah we went thur the same thing in the USA too NotLikeThis Just not as bad
[4:33:49] <+chase959> freeza was when I started and I was young then I watched everything-ish back up to freeza
[4:33:52] <Dean_Inbetween> And then toonami bought the dub rights and then FINALLY we got it
[4:33:54] <hkgamingtv> Canadian Pride VoteYea
[4:33:55] <duskrush> Leave Jiren to me, RADITZ
[4:33:56] <BubbaGAN0USH> yovgKai
[4:33:56] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I started Yu Yu Hakusho at Hiei killing that Ice dude in the tower
[4:33:57] <Ultimatefool> Goku turns Super Saiyan "Time to fight Raditz"
[4:33:57] <+Zeromaru2> NotLikeThis
[4:33:58] <+chase959> bc of that system
[4:34:00] <%Ancopro> it sent us back in time
[4:34:03] <+JeluxDaCasual> 52 episodes, then reset EVERY FUCKING TIME
[4:34:04] <%dekkitout> Goku FINALLY hits super saiyan- and now back to Raditz
[4:34:06] <asd2897> digimon also looped forever
[4:34:08] <Zayasu> do people rather have filler arcs or really stretched out episodes? LUL
[4:34:12] <%emperordread> LUL
[4:34:13] <%krispen_wa> TEC?
[4:34:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> Jiren shows ups then.... Raditz LUL
[4:34:14] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:34:16] <%doomerskeletor13> My parents wouldn’t let me watch Dragonball as a kid lmao
[4:34:16] <huskarl_zap> Disgusting xenos
[4:34:19] <+maenos2> well THATS not getting taken out of context
[4:34:20] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog
[4:34:21] <BubbaGAN0USH> *confetti*
[4:34:21] <Halospaz117> DO IT
[4:34:22] <Shardlab> I had no cable. So anime on TV kinda went away until I got a damned job
[4:34:23] <%krispen_wa> CLIP THAT
[4:34:24] <%Tuna_Can_0> turn it on 😡
[4:34:26] <ashenjuan25> Still think rockstar game design is fucked with its selective “””””realism”””””” that breaks the flow of gameplay too often which wouldn’t be bad like in say an open world rpg but it isn’t consistent enough to make the player internalize the direct mechanics of the world
[4:34:29] <+GarboArbo> Old enough to blow up
[4:34:30] <%Solidnick18> it was that grunts birthday
[4:34:34] <+BigBlackBankai> Child soldier vs Child soldiers
[4:34:37] <wibbwobbler> DON'T KILL CHILDREN, NOT COOL
[4:34:38] <lotharrio> Maybe child murder is a VIRTUE in their culture.
[4:34:40] <duskrush> The average grunt lifespan is 58 years
[4:34:41] <%cowardman93> hey Woolie, humans can be fathers at 10. think about it
[4:34:45] <%jorniev> NOOOOO
[4:34:47] <DoubleKK64> that's the pinnacle of JUST TALK
[4:34:51] <%doomerskeletor13> @ashenjuan25 ok but I like it tho
[4:34:54] <%jorniev> ITS IMPREGNABLE
[4:34:56] <+wunp_fxs> LOK Is great VA not sure about LP wrothy tho....
[4:34:57] <hkgamingtv> Soul Reaver is bomb
[4:34:57] <iamtheTwitchghost> great series, not sure if it's a good stream game
[4:35:01] <Afterman_> @WoolieVersus it has the greatest voice acting of ANY game In my opinion. and the story is TOP notch.
[4:35:01] <lotharrio> Legacy of Kain is a series that goes strange places.
[4:35:12] <leroyslammin> Aw I missed it!
[4:35:12] <Dean_Inbetween> @duskrush i wonder if thats in a healthy environment or them under the heel of the covenant...
[4:35:16] <%doomerskeletor13> I only know Kane and Lynch because of Half Life VR AI
[4:35:20] <ashenjuan25> Also think gameplay incentives in rdr2 are totally fucked that makes the first playthrough of the game missable for a lot of some of the best content in the game
[4:35:23] <%jorniev> KAIN
[4:35:25] <+ScottishMadJacko> dunno howd it do as an lp but they're good games
[4:35:28] <hkgamingtv> Kain
[4:35:34] <%jorniev> KAINE IS AN ASHOLE
[4:35:45] <ashenjuan25> I still love rdr2 but it tests my patience more than rdr1 ever did
[4:35:52] <Afterman_> yea, just wanted to throw it out there, absolutely no pressure
[4:35:54] <prime_name> Halo 3 is GO
[4:35:57] <lotharrio> We did the Halo.
[4:35:57] <+GarboArbo> YEEEE
[4:35:58] <iamtheTwitchghost> ItsHappening
[4:35:59] <alrobot2014> halfway to finishing the fight i think
[4:36:00] <%Solidnick18> aye
[4:36:00] <+brave_sj> What if grunts used to have full 80-90 year lifespans but they've been used as cannon fodder for so long they've evolved to mature at 7 and die at 15
[4:36:00] <leroyslammin> I missed the whole thing!
[4:36:02] <AmericanaRed> Haha2020
[4:36:03] <%dekkitout> Complete the Conflict
[4:36:06] <DesertPenguin> Dude, play the Legacy of Kain games
[4:36:06] <%koolaid_kevster> fihgt finidshing is IMMINANT
[4:36:11] <@Menitta> CONCLUDE THE CLASH
[4:36:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Fight:paused
[4:36:12] <+QueequegTheater> LittleV fake fan
[4:36:12] <%Solidnick18> nearly finished that fight
[4:36:13] <DesertPenguin> People love the classics so you can't go wrong
[4:36:15] <emeraldskrull> halo 3 finish the fight halo 4 start a new fight for no reason
[4:36:16] <undercoverbarber> HSWP Jebaited
[4:36:17] <rsg220> Fight Finish Pending
[4:36:18] <@Solidus_113> the game just came out
[4:36:18] <+CyanDeadEye> On PC
[4:36:19] <AmericanaRed> LEGEND
[4:36:27] <hkgamingtv> Vs screen lies
[4:36:28] <DesertPenguin> Has commences
[4:36:29] <%RyTYoung> Probably because they're all playing multiplayer LUL
[4:36:34] <subjectg> they’re a bit busy playing multi
[4:36:35] <%a_goth_pancake> FIGHT.... FINISHED
[4:36:35] <Ynkubus_> half the players are only doing pvp
[4:36:39] <%doomerskeletor13> I think most people care about multiplayer more honestly
[4:36:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> it's the intended difficulty
[4:36:43] <+QueequegTheater> Heroic is the developer intended difficulty
[4:36:48] <ashenjuan25> Real talk tho rdr2 story is fucking phenomenal and pretty layered and one of the only western games that don’t stereotype indigenous Americans to justify them as enemy npcs that you have to kill like in say revolver
[4:36:49] <%a_goth_pancake> just came out fam
[4:36:50] <+Bail_seven> SLASO
[4:36:58] <hkgamingtv> the fight is INFINITE
[4:37:01] <wibbwobbler> watch those shields bruh
[4:37:05] <%a_goth_pancake> I'm playin no man's sky, get off my tits
[4:37:11] <DatAsuna> Revengance also, hard mode is the real mode unless it's your first EVER character action game
[4:37:13] <DesertPenguin> It forces you to think tactically instead of just shooting everything
[4:37:14] <+BigBlackBankai> cone death
[4:37:15] <BubbaGAN0USH> the rockets LUL
[4:37:20] <@Menitta> I really really love how the MCC lets you install what you want. Picking and choosing campaign/multiplayer for each game is amazing and every collection needs that
[4:37:20] <+TheIntellectional> or rocket launchering you, twice
[4:37:22] <%doomerskeletor13> @ashenjuan25 Yea I love the story. The gameplay isn’t for everyone but I love it too
[4:37:25] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Did Woolie get splattered by a cone yet
[4:37:30] <%krispen_wa> DON'T GET COCKY
[4:37:32] <$jake5713> GG
[4:37:33] <%Solidnick18> seeya next week for more halo
[4:37:34] <90k9> GAME OVER YEAH
[4:37:40] <prince_johnny_> GG
[4:37:41] <%doomerskeletor13> See y’all, good session
[4:37:42] <Torivore> Heroic encourages learning but legendary punishes you for not knowing
[4:37:43] <brachydios777> @ashenjuan25 I don’t think you ever fight them if I remember right
[4:37:45] <+hermeslaflare> @WoolieVersus i feel like playing on legendary is similar to how the action is explained in the books, the UNSC is always getting destroyed and other spartans
[4:37:48] <@Menitta> GANG TACKLED
[4:37:50] <%Solidnick18> yeee gang tackled
[4:37:51] <alrobot2014> @QueequegTheater nope but he's been rocketed by 2 marines in a row
[4:37:54] <subjectg> @queequegtheater tbf, that event was rare enough that the dude got recon for it, don’t get your hopes up

[4:38:36] <ashenjuan25> But most western games have some pretty damn shitty rep of indigenous Americans seeing that rdr2 handled with nuance was pretty great
[4:38:37] <alrobot2014> oooooh
