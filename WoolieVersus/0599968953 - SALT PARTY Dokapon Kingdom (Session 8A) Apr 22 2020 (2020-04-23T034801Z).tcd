[0:03:04] <+Kindan55> watching twitch vods suck to watch. so downloads make sense.
[0:03:07] <%insomniacCoder> Woolie don't forget to buy a weapon, and get spinners before caves
[0:03:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @Kriss1827 I can just message you here...I don't use twitch that often and hopefully you'll still be on this stream when he hops off the tower

[0:06:06] <C4m3r0n0409> EWW
[0:06:12] <%Wouldz> is a blood/peace pool overlay lossible

[0:06:28] <%fuji_92> you how much is the bloodpool now?
[0:06:31] <@akuda_bar> @Wouldz that is smart
[0:06:32] <%binkarus> I don't like information disappearing
[0:06:33] <%fuji_92> *yo
[0:06:34] <%doomerskeletor13> This game will end with someone mysteriously disappearing
[0:06:39] <DianaTheAscian> we will have peace when only 1 is left standing
[0:06:44] <%doomerskeletor13> wooliePOYO
[0:06:44] <%arkv01> @binkarus cool, good to know we've got guys keeping backups in case
[0:06:45] <%Kriss1827> Whats up Fujiwara!
[0:06:48] <%KineKithZen> There will be peace in our time
[0:06:58] <%binkarus> Always be prepared
[0:07:03] <+Dorf1> dark souls
[0:07:03] <%Wouldz> peace is war and war never ends
[0:07:06] <+Pookiedaexzile> Everyone calling me dumb doesn't realize that you can't walk into a TV studio and run a show on NBC, the lockdown on Big studios over small internet companiesl. So its gonna be ABC's Rooster Teeeth
[0:07:07] <%fuji_92> @kriss1827 KonCha
[0:07:08] <%azastyles> milathElaHams miltiaCool
[0:07:09] <theturtlesnatcher> @binkarus and i appreciate people like you that archive things
[0:07:12] <Varadox> You already have Woolie. You played Black Mesa before you played HL1.
[0:07:13] <%Flamefish345> Flamefish345 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Gonna prime sub with Woolz for now until Pat stops playing FF7 and/or P5 Royal. P. S.: go Reggie go
[0:07:15] <%jiggy_snipe> yea you did Dark Souls 2 1st
[0:07:23] <%djazo> play the first one LUL
[0:07:24] <%Lion_kun> What about RE2 woolie
[0:07:29] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 hope youre well
[0:07:36] <Varadox> Also, RE2 and DaS2.
[0:07:39] <%Lion_kun> WHAT ABOUT DARK SOULS
[0:07:41] <%fuji_92> imagine starting with ds2 Kappa
[0:07:55] <Malik1002> HOW DO I GET INTO KAMIN RIDER?
[0:08:04] <%doomerskeletor13> The Yakuza series is kind of the exception to that. Starting with 0 is the best option, and the Kiwami remakes supplant the need for the originals story wise. So chronological order works well instead of release order
[0:08:08] <%GenesisKnight> @Malik1002 Start with W or OOO
[0:08:08] <%Solracmoster2000> woolieS woolieT
[0:08:20] <%fuji_92> @kriss1827 surviving, like one does in these days... hope you're well too
[0:08:22] <+tearfuldevil> most people whose parents don't ccare, myself included saw star wars prequels first
[0:08:31] <Varadox> I still argue release order for Yakuza.
[0:08:34] <Varadox> So I hope you have a PS2.
[0:08:35] <+Aldesso> You also never played the first 100 Wonderful games. You started with 101
[0:08:38] <%Wouldz> woolieYE
[0:08:38] <%INDECISIVEjew> yeah but then you have to figure out what to skip, so it's still a valid question. everyone sleeps on Metal Gear 1 and 2
[0:08:39] <Varadox> If you don't, then buy a PS2.
[0:08:39] <%KineKithZen> Zero makes Kiwami 1 really feel flawed
[0:08:54] <+gutlesscoward> I started the MGS series with MGS4
[0:08:58] <+tearfuldevil> i've only played snake eatere and it was fine on its own
[0:08:59] <MattDemers> @Varadox PS2 Yakuza emulation isn't bad, and I really recommend playing it.
[0:09:00] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 Just at work like always, no quarantine for me :p
[0:09:04] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Typhaeon Kiwami 1 if anything, is a massive improvement over the ps2 version as least
[0:09:08] <DianaTheAscian> what about series like FF or persona? that are numbered but really not connected ?
[0:09:11] <%KineKithZen> Undoubtedly
[0:09:12] <theturtlesnatcher> @gutlesscoward i started mgs with revengence
[0:09:13] <+tearfuldevil> well, i did only play snake eater, now i've also played 5
[0:09:16] <Brandon__Brando> I played mgs chronology story wise I regret it but did it because had the Xbox hd remastered that didn't have mgs1
[0:09:17] <Dr00_PhD> The metal gear collection puts it in chronological order which is how i played it
[0:09:22] <%Javaa01> Kiwami 1 feels flawed because it's a very direct remake of Yakuza 1, and not really a re-imagining
[0:09:23] <Varadox> @MattDemers I still have my slim PS2 and beat Yakuza 1 and 2 on it.
[0:09:28] <+tearfuldevil> @Diana869 that doesn't count unless your interested in gameplay progression
[0:09:31] <MattDemers> @Varadox Yeah, it isn't bad
[0:09:38] <%KineKithZen> You're going from a very refined entry in the series to a rework of the original that was still finding its legs
[0:09:42] <%Wouldz> I started mgs with 2, because BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO
[0:09:44] <%fuji_92> @kriss1827 what work, if you don't mind?
[0:10:01] <%INDECISIVEjew> I listened to my friend in high school who had me start MGS with 3 and Resident Evil with 0.
[0:10:02] <%azastyles> azastyles subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:10:12] <%andrei11dr> Why does Woolie keep wearing stuff that looks like table cloth ?
[0:10:14] <%azastyles> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:10:15] <%INDECISIVEjew> we're not friends any more
[0:10:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> I perfer youtuve video on the badones
[0:10:32] <%djazo> yeah yakuza 0 is the start
[0:10:33] <%doomerskeletor13> I think chronological order for the Yakuza series works
[0:10:43] <%SchwaAkari> !uptime
[0:10:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 18 minutes and 44 seconds
[0:10:48] <%Javaa01> Zero is a better intro into the series then Yakuza 1/Kiwami 1
[0:10:50] <%SchwaAkari> Oh my god I finally caught one
[0:10:54] <%jiggy_snipe> what about Kiwami 1 then 0 then 2 3 so on?
[0:10:55] <%GenesisKnight> Yakuza 0 is built to be a starting point so I think that matters a lot
[0:10:59] <jbrowning134> I played crisis core before FF7 and it made FF7 so much better when I did play it
[0:10:59] <%Lion_kun> YESSSSSS
[0:11:06] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[0:11:09] <%Lion_kun> KIRYUS SUIT
[0:11:16] <%djazo> every yakuza game does that
[0:11:20] <%INDECISIVEjew> it does but it's just Easter eggs really
[0:11:27] <%fuji_92> it does but nothing too bad
[0:11:28] <%SchwaAkari> Thank you to whomever gifted me a sub recently ♥
[0:11:29] <+Dr_DangerPhD> there's a couple moments like that but the game manages to be very self contained
[0:11:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes it does do that but it works as a prequel more than it does that
[0:11:31] <%Rhinoprotoss> Daigo?
[0:11:40] <nepwar> a major character gets way more detail and backstory that you would def would have cared about
[0:11:44] <%Javaa01> There are nods, but even without knowing the nods, you can totally follow what's happening
[0:11:48] <%Plus_On_Black> What's really really good?
[0:12:03] <%SirGO0SE> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:12:05] <%SchwaAkari> SchwaAkari is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel!
[0:12:06] <%SchwaAkari> SchwaAkari is paying forward the Gift they got from Kazuhira_Boat to the community!
[0:12:07] <%SchwaAkari> SchwaAkari gifted a Tier 1 sub to RacistWakka!
[0:12:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yakuzo 0 "This Butler boy sure is calm"
[0:12:12] <DianaTheAscian> but what if its a mess?
[0:12:18] <%SchwaAkari> I will gladly pay that forward
[0:12:18] <%andrei11dr> Everything to do with Nishiki in 0 kinda doesn't feel the same if you never played 1
[0:12:20] <%KineKithZen> On-point gift sub
[0:12:39] <%optimasmaximas> not entirely accurate
[0:12:39] <alrobot2014> damn it Cartoon Network
[0:12:45] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 manager at a factory wont go into more detail thsn that :p
[0:12:50] <@akuda_bar> firefly was like that too
[0:12:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah that’s fair. Star Wars website actually released an official list to watch stuff chronologically
[0:12:53] <%jiggy_snipe> I say Kiwami 1 1st then 0 because talk about how Kiwami feels weak compared to 0
[0:13:02] <$JobbedBone> 32 inch LCD TV 299
[0:13:02] <%Zerotoad5> Gundam Victory aired in wrong order
[0:13:02] <masterfire23> CN is so bad with that stuff
[0:13:05] <%Chatterbox1991> is Cartoon Network garbagem
[0:13:11] <%GenesisKnight> Danny Phantom did that. Danny suddenly had new powers because they skipped the episode where he discovered them
[0:13:13] <DianaTheAscian> i am not suppressed CN messed that up
[0:13:14] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:13:19] <+Dr_DangerPhD> I remember the clerks cartoon got fucked by being aired out of order
[0:13:21] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s also episodes from later seasons that take place before the first season intentionally
[0:13:24] <%fuji_92> @kriss1827 that's fine, thanks for the answer tho, no worries... SeemsGood
[0:13:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Eat up piggies
[0:13:30] <+Qsmash_> US got Dragonball Z before Dragonball
[0:13:35] <%INDECISIVEjew> I'm literally animating on a TV show right now where the studio just changed the episode order and moved some season 1 episodes to season 2
[0:13:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> I know there was a Transformers cartoon that got fucked over with out of order airing..
[0:13:39] <%Lion_kun> Is a Yakuza 0 lp a possibility?
[0:13:40] <nepwar> should revist old CN shows now that we're stuck home
[0:13:45] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus not true, see what @lewdskeletor13 said
[0:13:48] <%andrei11dr> Y watched Gundam in chronological order and oh boy, going from 0083 to Zeta was weird
[0:13:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> Fuck those people
[0:13:52] <@akuda_bar> @INDECISIVEjew damn
[0:14:04] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 hope quarantine hasnt made you go mad tho
[0:14:09] <+linSP> just show the finale first woolieF woolieF_HF
[0:14:12] <+bluebreadtoons> Heeereee WE GOOOO
[0:14:13] <%jinking79> happen to Big O too
[0:14:23] <%derap41> TV was fucking awful
[0:14:31] <%Lion_kun> Im watching Gundam from the beginning
[0:14:31] <nepwar> did woolie finish judgement?
[0:14:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wait what happened to BigO
[0:14:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> @INDECISIVEjew Doesn't sound like there will be a S2 UL
[0:14:39] <DianaTheAscian> no
[0:14:56] <%jiggy_snipe> 1 and 2 happen later now Kappa
[0:14:57] <CappuccinoGuil> What's up, everyone?
[0:14:57] <+bluebreadtoons> waiting for TV was a period of time I'm super happy I dont have to return to
[0:15:10] <%fuji_92> @kriss1827 no more than I already was, but you know... Amazingly enough, my routine didn't change that much, be that good or bad...

[0:22:52] <%doomerskeletor13> PogChamp500 as a huge Yakuza nerd, I agree with Minh, chronological order works really well for the series. 0 works as a good intro to the universe, and actually adds more emotional weight to the first game. The remakes of 1 and 2 also retroactively reference 0, so it makes it more cohesive. My two cents, keep being cool y’all

[0:34:06] <Oxybe> tips should be to encourage better service, nit enure a livable wage.
[0:34:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Tipping is demeaning imo
