[0:01:22] <alrobot2014> i doom scrolled for 8 fucking hours yesterday
[0:01:29] <f2ai> Aegis Rim brings joy, except when I can't get merch for it
[0:01:32] <Solidnick18> i watched korone today. so i felt a little better.
[0:01:40] <darkkittycatlovery> Woolie, thoughts on PogChamp? Do you think they could have handled it better?
[0:01:42] <ColbyBryant> Starting 2021 with a bang. Yesterday was amazing content ngl
[0:01:46] <+jiggy_snipe> ?
[0:01:47] <%Amaideus> I've been trolling Redhats on a forum for like half a day, it's been great
[0:01:47] <alrobot2014> korone and miko playing a way out felt nice
[0:01:51] <%d1stantutopia> Taking a break from staring across the Atlantic at the US having a completely normal one to instead watch the lads play this amazing game.
[0:01:59] <%Amaideus> Like 8 lunatics got banned
[0:02:05] <Solidnick18> yeah that was fun @alrobot2014
[0:02:09] <+jiggy_snipe> no one expected them to rush the Capitol
[0:02:09] <$razielhex> @darkkittycatlovery "Hey, fuck that guy, we're not gonna promote his stupid face." is handling things alright.
[0:02:16] <CaptainBright> I was shocked only 4 died
[0:02:22] <AnneSQF> does Woolie have a Parler account? XD
[0:02:24] <KaitlynnHere> They were informed but didn’t care

[0:02:40] <JetpackMcQuack> Yup, shit’s crazy
[0:02:43] <+cvp5127> they blame the other side NotLikeThis
[0:02:46] <+b_aleph> I don't think WWE will be doing Capitol Punishment anymore...
[0:02:49] <+Cynicalto> I think most people thought is was bluster
[0:02:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:02:54] <+Aldesso> only 4 terrorists died?
[0:02:59] <CaptainBright> to think that people in Ferguson in 2015 had more oppression from authorities than what happened yesterday
[0:02:59] <+PkSilent01> !Motivated
[0:03:02] <@Moobot> 1973 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[0:03:05] <$razielhex> bakkooOn bakkooLl bakkooOn bakkooLl
[0:03:16] <+jiggy_snipe> people expected a protest, no one expected the Capitol to be taken over
[0:03:18] <X2Eliah> Well, based on yesterday, that building is 100% not one of the most secure places in the us
[0:03:24] <Clundy> People keep comparing it to the protests last year and I can’t help but throw up all over them
[0:03:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[0:03:32] <%Amaideus> It sounds stupid, but gamefaqs is how I get my news because they're SUPER fast and quick on the draw with this sort of shit
[0:03:33] <X2Eliah> There's more protection in a rock concert...
[0:03:36] <Solidnick18> isn't it
[0:03:40] <+jmcclellan18> Are you guys gonna talk about the PogChamp removal?

[0:03:42] <+MetroidPrimeRib> Japan's insanely right wing. not as much as brazil or Israel but not far off
[0:03:43] <%baronouroboros> Well, it's fascists doing fascism
[0:03:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Canada had a march in Vancouver, Japan was in Tokyo and it's... fuck
[0:03:49] <%d1stantutopia> @Clundy the only worthwhile comparison there is the damning difference in police response.
[0:03:51] <enZymeth> Bakamitai
[0:03:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Anti-globalism
[0:03:53] <AnneSQF> solidarity for the terrorists??
[0:03:57] <%Livelinne> Fuuuuuckin netouyos spaceyeenShock
[0:03:59] <TTouchdown> White conservatives can openly discuss crimes and get the kid treatment.
[0:04:00] <Clundy> @d1stantutopia EXACTLY!
[0:04:05] <+PatchworkSquid> That really put a damper on me trying to bury myself in anime
[0:04:08] <%Razputin217> DAME DA NE
[0:04:12] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm super scared we'll have a similar thing in Brazil. Every time shit goes down in the US, it's like a premonition of things to come here.
[0:04:15] <darkkittycatlovery> Does Woolie know about PogChamp?
[0:04:17] <ColbyBryant> Honestly what were they expecting to happen?
[0:04:21] <darkkittycatlovery> I’d assume he does.
[0:04:26] <enZymeth> He does
[0:04:30] <%d1stantutopia> Glad that here in London, despite having had an incompetent right-wing govt for 11 years now, we did not have any "solidarity with the fascist coup" marches.
[0:04:31] <+Aldesso> @darkkittycatlovery hes a twitch streamer. Of course he knows
[0:04:36] <+b_aleph> @CappuccinoGuil Importadores de idiotice desde 1500
[0:04:38] <%wibbwobbler> i work with people shouting the United states of china when biden won
[0:04:50] <%wibbwobbler> makes no sense
[0:04:53] <%p4ntless> when America shits its pants the whole world has to smell it, we practically fling it around like a big stupid gorilla
[0:04:54] <JetpackMcQuack> There’s plenty of crazy to go around
[0:04:56] <Clundy> @d1stantutopia 2021 just started don’t jinx it
[0:05:07] <%Livelinne> mom?
[0:05:08] <TTouchdown> They entered the capitol with guns and zip ties. They wanted to “arrest” and execute “traitors.”
[0:05:12] <Solidnick18> hmm
[0:05:13] <darkkittycatlovery> America can be summed up with “UH OH, STINKY”

[0:05:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I'm really hoping that while this shit got to this point and might happen for a little bit longer, once he's Biden is actually in office most people will cut this shit out
[0:05:36] <%richardlikespies> Wait before the emote mode hits, the release date for DMC6 is woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[0:05:36] <%Amaideus> Even Canadian ones
[0:05:38] <%d1stantutopia> @Clundy look man, we've got enough problems here already between the Tories fucking up EVERYTHING to do with covid at every turn and Brexit being exactly as awful as we all predicted 4 years ago.
[0:05:38] <%gatorafan> Thank you Door dash! :)
[0:05:47] <CaptainBright> I think of America now as when US soldiers lifting up the flag in Iwo Jima, people all around the world now can point at that picture of that dude with the confederate flag in the Capitol
[0:05:50] <%Amaideus> Our Left is most people's Right
[0:05:56] <+Aldesso> do you guys only order or sometimes make your own food?
[0:06:00] <%tallik44123> ilive in europe so we have to deal with the french , so this nothing to me
[0:06:02] <%Valask> oh god this reminds me of my essay months. If I consume coffee now then I can get back to work on the dissertation faster khezuWTF
[0:06:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it feels like right now this is people's attempt at a final attempt to stop biden, but it's pretty much done at this point
[0:06:13] <@akuda_bar> upside: i get 8 hours of overtime because of it

[0:08:18] <+Personified134> I am here to have my dick blown off by lore bombs
[0:08:20] <@Menitta> It is weird though because if you look at Vods, anytime Pogchamp is used, that message looks fuckin weird with a missing image icon

[0:12:58] <%d1stantutopia> If Woolie gets the chance to make a new channel emote it should be a Yakisoba pan
[0:13:03] <twoah> Peach bread is fire

[0:14:06] <Zeif00> It's not keto, but it good
[0:14:11] <inkthepeasant> Walking past the bakeries in Asakusa was like the greatest experience of my life
[0:14:11] <Clundy> @d1stantutopia jealous AF
[0:14:12] <%zanzibar_junker> In Yakuza they have steamed pizza buns
[0:14:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @masterfire23 it's ok, the spirit of pogchamp will live on

[0:14:45] <%zanzibar_junker> I love croquettes
[0:14:45] <KaitlynnHere> What about steam buns tho?
[0:14:45] <darkkittycatlovery> What about steamed clams?
[0:14:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> There's this bakery at the H-Mart I go to, and my god the curry bread they have there...
[0:14:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Regret_rookie nah this is pregame
[0:15:00] <+Dova573> The college student live saver
[0:15:03] <Clundy> Sweet potato buns SeemsGood
[0:15:03] <lovewin> now I just want coco bread
[0:15:09] <X2Eliah> Oh god I just googled it, and yakisoba pan is... a hotdog stuffed with noodles? ... like, whaaa?
[0:15:14] <wembleyttv> Kind of sad since we are in lock down in the UK one of our major bakery chains is in a lot of trouble and they sell the most epic sausage rolls
[0:15:16] <@Menitta> one might say it is encouraged to get this bread
[0:15:23] <%Valask> UK convenience store food ate away at my very soul
[0:15:25] <%Livelinne> konbini meals are solid woolieGASM
[0:15:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yakitori, Fried Chicken, Meat Buns
[0:15:38] <%zanzibar_junker> I love breakfast burritos

[0:15:52] <+matteasy31> Takoyaki Kreygasm
[0:15:59] <+clack14> mouth explosion Kreygasm
[0:15:59] <X2Eliah> So the thing is, UK and US really don't have much of a "convenience store food to go" culture; fast-food restaurants are kinda in that place
[0:16:02] <pixel_river> Hemborgor
[0:16:03] <%gatorafan> I never got takoyaki, I really wanna try it
[0:16:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The only comparable thing we kinda have in my neck of the woods is Cumberland Farms
[0:16:14] <darkkittycatlovery> I almost said a yakuza spoiler lol
[0:16:22] <+JustToWatch> a single sour patch kid would kill a 1940's child on the spot
[0:16:23] <%zanzibar_junker> I watch street food vids too often
[0:16:26] <%KoopaPrez> KoopaPrez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! I subbed during Paper Mario. Can't believe it's already been this long.
[0:16:27] <KaitlynnHere> What
[0:16:28] <+cvp5127> meme through the pain
[0:16:30] <+jiggy_snipe> yea lol
[0:16:35] <pixel_river> yes
[0:16:36] <inkthepeasant> playing melty blood
[0:16:42] <%Valask> they TOOK SELFIES WITH THE GUARDS
[0:16:43] <%zanzibar_junker> 4 bombs though
[0:16:44] <@Solidus_113> People actually showed up for the Area 51 raid
[0:16:46] <KaitlynnHere> They got their memes
[0:16:48] <f2ai> Woolie people stormed area 51
[0:16:50] <X2Eliah> I'm kinda upset that they did storm the congress, but didn't storm area 51
[0:16:56] <wembleyttv> That guy STOLE her stand
[0:16:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:16:58] <CaptainBright> truly genius kojumbo, with his memes
[0:17:00] <%ChoculaUltra> Kojima was right monkaS
[0:17:01] <+Personified134> I gotta say all the pelosi memes with melty blood and shit have been amazing
[0:17:03] <+clack14> area 51 had better memes
[0:17:05] <%zanzibar_junker> a cop tasered himself and got a heart attack
[0:17:14] <enZymeth> MGS2
[0:17:19] <%ChoculaUltra> @zanzibar_junker that is fucking hilarious
[0:17:22] <VGreenGoblinV> Oh, you mean all that evidence?
[0:17:25] <KaitlynnHere> Now they can show it to their kids
[0:17:27] <JetpackMcQuack> I’m nancy kinamaHype
[0:17:29] <+PkSilent01> We can Storm Arena 51 Again
[0:17:32] <@Menitta> "Something's brewing at the US Capitol..." [Al Pacino walks in]
[0:17:33] <%Valask> awwww
[0:17:35] <AnneSQF> I hate how the far-right uses viking/celtic/nordic images. Makes me ashamed to be Scandinavian
[0:17:42] <CappuccinoGuil> It's an old tactic. Do something goofy to make light of the situation. They brought zip ties and bombs, let's not forget.
[0:17:43] <@akuda_bar> big fluffy dog name
[0:17:43] <ColbyBryant> Imagine storming the capitol for the senile game show host LUL
[0:17:45] <+jiggy_snipe> I always assumed it was a nickname
[0:17:46] <KaiserMario> Woolie Mammoth?
[0:17:51] <@akuda_bar> my sisters cat is named wilow
[0:17:52] <+oAlec687> lol now everyone cares about the government when its the other side is starting shit
[0:17:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @AnneSQF nah man don't be ashamed fuck em
[0:18:02] <darkkittycatlovery> Rename the cat to Opey.
[0:18:12] <darkkittycatlovery> Best name for a cute cat
[0:18:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Yipes tho
[0:18:33] <osaka_daioh> Remember the other things they banned.
[0:18:39] <%zanzibar_junker> I basically spoiled myself on Aegis but I just bought it on sale
[0:18:41] <wembleyttv> It's like yesterday as well Jerma was streaming and someone show him an image of the "Jerma is sus" meme at the protest and he was freaking the hell out. Lucky enough it was a fake
[0:18:46] <%kyh9> Yeah but just drop it altogether
[0:18:49] <inkthepeasant> KomodoHype gang
[0:19:05] <%kyh9> Like, don't replace it. Just have some balls and drop Pogchamp altogether
[0:19:06] <JetpackMcQuack> KomodoHype more komodo
[0:19:15] <%gatorafan> KomodoHype our time has come
[0:19:16] <%d1stantutopia> @CappuccinoGuil I don't think enough people are highlighting the fact that these mfers brought zip ties into congress with the intent to take hostages.
[0:19:17] <thelonechris> KomodoHype
[0:19:17] <AnneSQF> @cobalt_phoenix_ luckily I'm not ashamed on a daily basis, but seeing the racoon man with a Thor's hammer on his chest made my stomach turn
[0:19:18] <%baronouroboros> The capitol police were complicit in this, considering their wilful carelesness to the fascist coup attempt
[0:19:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> KomodoHype
[0:19:23] <+JustToWatch> it's meant to be a UNIVERSAL symbol of hype, and it can't live up to that anymore
[0:19:24] <%Livelinne> tbh it's surprising how long PogChamp survived
[0:19:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> KomodoHype
[0:19:25] <setronitis> @wembleyttv holy shit really? thats fucked
[0:19:26] <%zanzibar_junker> Had no clue what pog was
[0:19:49] <%ChoculaUltra> gootecks going out super sad was not on my 2020-2021 bingo sheet
[0:19:54] <darkkittycatlovery> Didn’t PogChamp deny covid was real?
[0:19:56] <+jiggy_snipe> well calling the new one PogChamp wouldn't make sense. There is a reason its called PogChamp
[0:19:58] <twoto858> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:19:59] <%Puhff> One dude was fired cuz he wore his work lantard in the mob LUL
[0:20:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @AnneSQF yeah...
[0:20:07] <%Valask> alternative reality man
[0:20:09] <X2Eliah> @AnneSQF Agreed. I fear we might see a huge backlash against nordic symbols in the coming year because of that asshead
[0:20:12] <+Dova573> Man even in highschool, I never bothered with facebook
[0:20:13] <darkkittycatlovery> Can’t we just rebrand to WogChamp?
[0:20:15] <%Valask> god it's scary
[0:20:16] <osaka_daioh> Years change.
[0:20:16] <+cvp5127> none of them were wearing mask too
[0:20:25] <%kyh9> Yeah, but people on the Left never go out in big mobs because of their conspiracy theories. People on the Right do it all the time
[0:20:34] <%kyh9> Like, I'd like some middle ground
[0:20:35] <%zanzibar_junker> There's a real good twitter about Japan forgiving insurrectionists
[0:20:36] <+omnipotentcreature> gootecks has been losing it for 2 or 3 years now
[0:20:44] <%kyh9> Between no political action and THE MOST political action
[0:20:46] <%d1stantutopia> I watched the video of the woman getting maced and crying about it again and I can't stop laughing
[0:20:51] <KaitlynnHere> Being in a bubble just creates division
[0:20:57] <+omnipotentcreature> he has been on conspiracy stuff for awhile
[0:20:57] <darkkittycatlovery> Yo what happened with the weeknd?
[0:20:58] <%Amaideus> I have multiple people I'm only still friends with on FB so I can see stuff I dislike
[0:21:00] <%Valask> and then election night happens
[0:21:01] <%kyh9> I just want people to show up to more protests and demonstrations without shit getting out of hand
[0:21:07] <osaka_daioh> Remember when people go "If you do this I will remove you from my friends list!"
[0:21:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @d1stantutopia fuck, can you send me the link? I gotta watch that
[0:21:09] <+mechslayer71> Oh boy, those people are sheltered
[0:21:10] <VGreenGoblinV> @d1stantutopia Have you seen the animaniacs remake?
[0:21:14] <osaka_daioh> Which just makes it just only see their stuff.
[0:21:18] <VGreenGoblinV> Remix*
[0:21:20] <%Valask> they have THEIR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK
[0:21:24] <wembleyttv> It's all underground
[0:21:29] <X2Eliah> Let's be real, you only need to visit 4chan, 8 chan or whatever and you *will* find them
[0:21:36] <+Dova573> I do remember having a history teacher that was a conservative but he never came off as the crazy right wing cultists
[0:21:38] <+matteasy31> Kojima 200 IQ
[0:21:48] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit Kojimbo
[0:21:50] <%Valask> ou god /pol
[0:21:53] <%kyh9> KOJIMA
[0:21:57] <+Dova573> He would like actually a discussion of things with students
[0:22:00] <jorniev> @d1stantutopia the peak of white privilige is never actually knowing the price of a revolution, like not actually even thinking about how bad it is.
[0:22:04] <osaka_daioh> "If you do this, I will block you" then get blindsided by those people.
[0:22:05] <Zeif00> People just finding out about Parler smh
[0:22:05] <DXLelouch24> Kojimbo is too powerful
[0:22:05] <wembleyttv> MGS 2 is a game that will stand the test of time
[0:22:09] <darkkittycatlovery> @cobalt_phoenix_ look up Mariokart Mukbang meme on YouTube. You won’t be disappointed. Click on the bus one.
[0:22:11] <ColbyBryant> To be fair there’s a bubble for everyone
[0:22:19] <%zanzibar_junker> I knew a lot middle eastern kids who are super right wing
[0:22:24] <%d1stantutopia> @jorniev lol she even says "it's a revolution!" through the tears
[0:22:25] <+clack14> everyone has a diaper they love
[0:22:26] <+vairland> This is why I always browse their sites as much as I do others
[0:22:36] <%kyh9> @Valask I generally check pol for news. Even if it's all bullshit, it aggregates faster and lets me see what the other side thinks a lot of the time
[0:22:36] <%d1stantutopia> @VGreenGoblinV no not yet, but I'm still interested
[0:22:42] <%d1stantutopia> Why, is it bad?
[0:22:45] <X2Eliah> Or, hell, listen to a random joe rogan podcast and high chance there will be someone from the hard-ass right wing
[0:22:52] <X2Eliah> especially lately
[0:22:55] <%Valask> @kyh9 election night was fun
[0:22:57] <pjbuster> It's a cult
[0:23:00] <CappuccinoGuil> That's a dangerous slope into "we should hear both sides." so you need to be careful there.
[0:23:02] <%Valask> COPE
[0:23:03] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:23:04] <jorniev> @d1stantutopia cause she doesnt get it! she has never gotten it!
[0:23:18] <X2Eliah> Wait hold on
[0:23:22] <+Dova573> well it dint come out of nowhere
[0:23:22] <osaka_daioh> it's true.
[0:23:24] <X2Eliah> do people not know of FOX NEWS
[0:23:26] <%Amaideus> It's "Hear both sides" as in "so you know what the enemy is up to", not "so you can sympathize with them"
[0:23:26] <X2Eliah> ?
[0:23:28] <+Dachillin> true
[0:23:31] <%Valask> your feed wants you to keep scrolling
[0:23:31] <AnneSQF> remember before you go on trump(dot)win: Express VPN ;)
[0:23:35] <+Foxfire710> Social media is just making everything worse
[0:23:37] <%Amaideus> Didn't you hear, Fox is too far left now
[0:23:37] <%d1stantutopia> @Amaideus exactly
[0:23:40] <+cvp5127> those fox news comments oof
[0:23:41] <%Amaideus> The new shit is OAN
[0:23:42] <+clack14> stormfront has some "views"
[0:23:49] <VGreenGoblinV> @d1stantutopia Just sent your way
[0:23:58] <FrostedZaibatsu> I grew up in FL. Turned out all the white parents were terrorist supporters
[0:23:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:24:02] <%Valask> someone once actually asked me "you sound like a reasonable person, so why Biden?"
[0:24:06] <+clack14> FrostedZaibatsu monkaS
[0:24:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @darkkittycatlovery thank you, that was amazing
[0:24:13] <%Valask> really opened my eyes
[0:24:18] <darkkittycatlovery> Do you think they told trump a bunch of top secrets and he’ll threaten to release them if he’s not president.
[0:24:21] <%SkellyVee> yeppppppp
[0:24:22] <+matteasy31> alberta lol
[0:24:28] <VGreenGoblinV> DC locals were told to stay home
[0:24:36] <VGreenGoblinV> We’re woke as hell here
[0:24:37] <%Amaideus> I guarantee they've been freezing Trump out of important shit for years
[0:24:48] <%Amaideus> He won't read anything that doesn't have his name every paragraph, they confirmed it
[0:24:48] <%kyh9> @Valask Every big happening is fun. Love the music choices in 2015 and 2019 election morning
[0:24:49] <+MetroidPrimeRib> is this pagliacci
[0:24:50] <+PatchworkSquid> My neighbor, my parents, my grandparents
[0:24:51] <+mechslayer71> Arizona went blue this time tho thank god
[0:24:52] <darkkittycatlovery> @cobalt_phoenix_ no problem glad you liked it!
[0:24:58] <+PatchworkSquid> Neighbors
[0:24:59] <%Amaideus> He doesn't have the patience
[0:25:04] <KaiserMario> Is this the Pagliacci joke?
[0:25:06] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:25:08] <CaptainBright> Man, that video of that old DC man screaming "....THOSE GODDAMN CRACKERS ARE TAKING OVER THE CAPITOL" gives me L I F E
[0:25:10] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:25:14] <osaka_daioh> that's right
[0:25:16] <+Dova573> is funny leaving in Houston and then just a 2 hour drive to my friends house and I start seeing the trump signs and crazy trumpers
[0:25:17] <%d1stantutopia> I love the Pagliacci joke LUL
[0:25:22] <+Dova573> 'Living
[0:25:22] <Solidnick18> ah i see
[0:25:24] <VGreenGoblinV> We were told that the US Capitol police can handle it because...well...yeah. They’re hardasses
[0:25:29] <%Amaideus> If Trump had any secrets to threaten with he'd already be doing it
[0:25:29] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[0:25:35] <AnneSQF> but doctor, I *am* Canadian
[0:25:40] <pjbuster> not gonna lie, hearing canadians react to us events makes me realize it's not just a horrible nightmare
[0:25:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Essence of Pagliacci
[0:25:47] <+JustToWatch> yohosie had a great variation on that
[0:25:48] <+cvp5127> will we get to 2-10 today
[0:26:01] <%Puhff> Did Reggie say Pagliaci is Canadian?
[0:26:02] <ColbyBryant> It’s pagliaccis all the way down
[0:26:02] <wembleyttv> Simple answer. WE ARE FUCKED long term answer we can un fuck ourself's
[0:26:02] <%kyh9> Doctor, I AM PogChamp
[0:26:07] <%Valask> @kyh9 they played Komme Susser Todd when Zuckrberg bought Occulaceor whatever that VR thing was called
[0:26:09] <VGreenGoblinV> Instead, the police LITERALLY LET THEM IN.
[0:26:10] <iheartmota> you canadians are fine.
[0:26:15] <%kyh9> Pagliacchamp
[0:26:19] <%kyh9> Pogliacchamp
[0:26:28] <+xerotwo> doodWat
[0:26:30] <+PkSilent01> KomodoHype
[0:26:35] <+MetroidPrimeRib> we have more people in just cali then in all of canada
[0:26:36] <Prevot> "but doctor, I AM a vtuber"
[0:26:37] <pixel_river> same for here en europe
[0:26:38] <iheartmota> atleast they didnt burn down the capitol building
[0:26:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah
[0:26:47] <AnneSQF> winds blows North, as my Canadian friend says
[0:26:49] <+xerotwo> It's fucked up
[0:26:51] <%Amaideus> The moral here? Make sure to keep some "friends" to hate in your social circle
[0:26:51] <pjbuster> Bruh, I don't want to burn
[0:26:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @iheartmota unfortunately, they are not, Canada has TONS of issues themselves, especially with their native genocide
[0:27:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> I saw roits were happening in Canada too. why?
[0:27:07] <+Boner_Girl> Some conservatives went into a building and spun around in Nancy Pelosi's chair. Quit acting like its a human tragedy.
[0:27:08] <wembleyttv> Same, Like all UK news switched towards whats going on in america and stopped reporting on covid
[0:27:09] <%d1stantutopia> When shit goes down in the US, the stink rises here in the UK too
[0:27:10] <%Valask> Middle East gets affected by Trump tweets more than any European countries zekeKEK
[0:27:10] <CaptainBright> The problem for people around my part of the world, is that with the government looking like absolute dumbasses, China goes MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[0:27:20] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Apathy is indee death
[0:27:28] <%d1stantutopia> Our Tories are like the GOP, but less openly evil and more subtle
[0:27:40] <iheartmota> wasn't there rumors that chinesee soldiers were training in canadian soil?
[0:27:53] <%MajkirM> It also hit us here in México :S we are watching in tension.
[0:28:02] <%wibbwobbler> kinda nice to see concern from other countries
[0:28:08] <+mechslayer71> That’s really dumb. White people run out shit
[0:28:11] <JetpackMcQuack> White people will fuck it up
[0:28:12] <pjbuster> All the black people I know and are related too are freaking out about this
[0:28:13] <%d1stantutopia> Don't forget that our current PM once called Muslim women "letterboxes" and then when the press tried to interview him at his home about it he came out with a tray of tea and bribed them with the tea on camera.
[0:28:16] <X2Eliah> @iheartmota I mean, there are rumours that space is fake so...
[0:28:18] <+mechslayer71> Our*
[0:28:19] <+clack14> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.
[0:28:19] <+cvp5127> yet
[0:28:28] <%Puhff> @Boner_girl they also had guns and zipties to bind hostages
[0:28:35] <+bear_breaker20> white people arent real
[0:28:41] <+Boner_Girl> @Puhff And what did they do with them?
[0:28:42] <CaptainBright> America is the barometer for how much shit in their own backyard affects their foreign policy, WHICH IS A FUCKING LOT
[0:28:45] <KaitlynnHere> @bear_breaker20 oh thank god
[0:28:50] <@akuda_bar> imagine being american unironically
[0:28:50] <ColbyBryant> Gotta take the grillpill
[0:28:51] <+matteasy31> True
[0:28:52] <pjbuster> white people be on a different meter bar
[0:28:59] <Prevot> man they should've gone through those emails and leaked some shit
[0:29:01] <+jiggy_snipe> @Boner_Girl well all the Congress left before they got there
[0:29:08] <%d1stantutopia> The best take I saw was "the CIA heartbroken that there's a coup happening they weren't involved in."
[0:29:09] <CappuccinoGuil> @Puhff Even worse, zip cuffs. The thick, tough, extremely hard to break kind.
[0:29:23] <+jiggy_snipe> if you think that Congress should have to leave Congress, well then
[0:29:26] <Clundy> Unironic US Nationalism 🤮🤮🤮
[0:29:29] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> Isolated people tend to also be more easy to gain into far right groups, because far right group are accepting of all deviations of society, because they have no filter, so they accept hate in their ranks. As a result of that, people feel their isolation is caused not by external factors but by society.
[0:29:32] <+MetroidPrimeRib> in eastern Washington state its extremely red
[0:29:36] <+Boner_Girl> @jiggy_snipe You're too afraid to say "they didnt hurt anyone."
[0:29:36] <iheartmota> you be welcomed in texas woolie
[0:29:39] <+Cynicalto> Red
[0:29:43] <%Amaideus> I heard they had a pipe bomb too, but I haven't seen any actual sources on it
[0:29:46] <KaitlynnHere> Division is bad for everyone
[0:29:47] <pjbuster> Florida fucks me up every day
[0:29:49] <pixel_river> true
[0:29:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah in HS going to a friends house and seeing a massive confederate flag
[0:29:56] <@akuda_bar> @Amaideus there were pipe bombs outside the DNC and RNC headquarters
[0:29:57] <%baronouroboros> I mean, Qanon took hold of a significant fraction of the country It. The fact is that America's conservative leaders decided to play with the devil, while for years democrats remained wilfully blind to the growing horror.
[0:30:03] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> So love one another please. Love someone who is distant
[0:30:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember people: don't punch fascists. Low kick and grab them too for a more stylish combo
[0:30:07] <jorniev> nationlism with absolute denial of the bad stuff is bad for any nation.
[0:30:08] <osaka_daioh> pretty good
[0:30:08] <%d1stantutopia> @Boner_Girl 4 people are dead; they would still be alive today if it weren't for this fumbled coup.
