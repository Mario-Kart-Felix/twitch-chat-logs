[0:01:51] <skyheys> @woolieversus This chapter has a cool visual style, but the devs didnt account for the player to grind for the ability to become bright yellow. The W Emblem causes a HUGE visual glitch this chapter.

[0:08:49] <zamzoph> I like Snowpiercer. The movie, anyway.
[0:08:50] <%chosenjuan42> THE FOOT CLAN
[0:08:51] <%KoopaPrez> Reggie doesnt discriminate, all feet are beautiful
[0:08:52] <Zeif00> Master Foot
[0:08:57] <%Solidnick18> i've been watching god of highschool
[0:08:58] <the_saltiest> we're talking about the anime right
[0:08:59] <skyheys> @hitchhikingthrough nope. but it's unlikely to get his attention now
[0:09:01] <redrins> has reggie seen the korean oldboy?
[0:09:01] <RichochetForce> Reggie: Foot Clan leader
[0:09:02] <%Solidnick18> it's alright

[0:09:54] <%LastHazzerd> @Corporate_Redeemer just fyi, you can get the Kirby Lamp at Lampsity dot com aparently
[0:09:54] <%Corporate_Redeemer> SPEAK AMERICAN
[0:09:54] <%kinetikpaws> i wanted to buy it even thought they won
[0:09:59] <%Irridium> if you watch anime subbed you are more cultured than the vast majority of movie watchers. Including the Academy.
[0:10:01] <%Livelinne> Ooblets when woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:10:02] <%HitchhikingThrough> Hey Woolie, the Wario Emblem breaks an important effect in chapter 4. Might want to unequip it as some point.

[0:10:23] <%Zabrewulf_X> Zabrewulf_X subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:10:24] <+noajenkk> reading is for nerds
[0:10:24] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @lasthazzerd Yea I'm about to try picking it up
[0:10:32] <%LastHazzerd> best of luck
[0:10:37] <NeroInfinite> weebs sit back down.
[0:10:39] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> I JUST learned he made that, why did Spike Lee want to adapt that??? It's so outside his norm
[0:10:40] <%chosenjuan42> It shouldn't matter
[0:10:45] <Nekros4442> This is not a subs vs dubs argument in the case of Old Boy
[0:10:45] <%kinetikpaws> watch king of the hill in its original form
[0:10:46] <+StooEsq> Haven't seen Spike Lee's Oldboy? Don't worry about it, you're good.
[0:10:47] <+noajenkk> STILL CORRECT BTW
[0:10:51] <+TheRisingPride> dub quality has gotten so much better in recent years
[0:10:51] <RichochetForce> Dubs led to the Bible Black scene in the outro.
[0:10:52] <%jiggy_snipe> dub quality has improved
[0:10:53] <%ekodrop> it's still like that
[0:10:54] <+zooeymainbtw> Still is
[0:10:55] <Rhinoprotoss> What a weeb
[0:10:55] <+ClericOfSparda> The American Oldboy is not terrible. It's not as good as the original, but it's still good.
[0:10:55] <%HitchhikingThrough> welp; will try one more time when gameplay starts I guess
[0:10:57] <%SmoothEnigma> SmoothEnigma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[0:10:58] <Nekros4442> Spike Lee's old boy is just a terrible adaptation
[0:10:58] <%Exiliator> Still correct :)
[0:10:58] <%Totally_Not_Toby> that was the way of the world back then
[0:10:58] <RichochetForce> But Dubs are way better now.
[0:10:59] <brachydios777> I don‚Äôt even get why Spike Lee even remade that
[0:11:04] <BreakersAweigh> dubs have gotten really good recently
[0:11:05] <+Ancopro> dubs omnomnom
[0:11:06] <+zooeymainbtw> dubs have gotten WORSE
[0:11:06] <%Solidnick18> i just watch both but it depends on the series.
[0:11:06] <brachydios777> But DBZ
[0:11:09] <glass_marcus> Honestlu....I miss bad dubs. Dubs are too good now
[0:11:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Most dubs are still meh. But some are great
[0:11:14] <time_axis> the duality of man
[0:11:15] <+MeatBomb> Having your translation filtered twice used to be horrible, but it's getting much better.
[0:11:16] <RichochetForce> @zooeymainbtw Not in games
[0:11:16] <+LoVezineTheAir> DBZ only exception
[0:11:16] <%jiggy_snipe> but you have teletoon Kappa
[0:11:18] <%kinetikpaws> they have a few special cases of good dubs
[0:11:20] <%Irridium> dubs are solid these days
[0:11:24] <+linSP> I can‚Äôt into granny goku
[0:11:25] <%gatorafan> Latino dubs were cool tho, haven't seen them in a while
[0:11:28] <overlord_nico> Baccano was a great dub
[0:11:28] <%chosenjuan42> YEAH DBZ DUB
[0:11:29] <%TheOddJik> there are plenty of good dubs nowadays
[0:11:29] <Nekros4442> Nah, DBZ Abridged is still the best
[0:11:30] <%ChoculaUltra> Baccano's dub was dope too
[0:11:31] <atomicxdj> dont forget the french version Woolie
[0:11:33] <Jonny_Uppercut> Yu Yu Hakusho dub ayaLEWD
[0:11:34] <pixel_river> i grew up with subs so its no issue
[0:11:35] <NotHereToStream> my boy wbop
[0:11:36] <+IceyCone> I think dubs are fine. its really a matter of preference to me
[0:11:37] <brachydios777> Also Beebop
[0:11:37] <OldOnyx> still mostly correct at least. There are just more exceptions these days
[0:11:38] <%axe_lobo_galen> wolf's rain and cowboy bebop are the best dubs hands down
[0:11:38] <atomicxdj> for the Quebec peeps
[0:11:39] <+Keyblade97> yuyu hakusho
[0:11:41] <+Ancopro> yeaaa true
[0:11:41] <%Totally_Not_Toby> ocean dub....... I miss you.........
[0:11:43] <DatAsuna> durarara
[0:11:44] <%sunnythedrunk> Best dubs are DBZ, CowBoy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo
[0:11:49] <%andrex2311> PASWG dub is soooooooooo good
[0:11:53] <%Irridium> Cromartie High School dub is thankfully really great
[0:11:55] <JaseAdrift> Not even Questionable IT IS BETTER
[0:11:55] <glass_marcus> I've never watched Space Dandy subbed and I never will
[0:11:56] <%prime_name> I'd say the FMAB dub is better...but recent events...
[0:11:57] <+genowyn> Baccano dub is great
[0:11:57] <+Deano8817> ghost stories tho
[0:11:57] <RichochetForce> @andrex2311 Agreed
[0:11:59] <fault_417> Yu Yu Hakusho‚Äôs terrific dub
[0:12:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @DatAsuna An a fellow person of culture
[0:12:01] <scorpionoutcast> First anime I ever saw was FMA dubbed
[0:12:03] <BearSawed> Beck has an awsome dub
[0:12:06] <brachydios777> Dbz kai‚Äôs dub is pretty good specifically
[0:12:06] <%twoto858> Yo, there's an interview article with Origami King's development team
[0:12:06] <%chosenjuan42> MY HERO MACADAMIA is good too
[0:12:07] <+noajenkk> agreed reggie
[0:12:09] <+Stormzcales_Lair> thats RAW though so you know
[0:12:09] <vaderxyz1970> Golden Boy dub is a FACT
[0:12:13] <MattDemers> Subs make me pay attention instead of zoning out and watching on another monitor.
[0:12:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> I prefer subs but awesome that people love dubs!
[0:12:16] <grimshuck> Big O is pretty good. Dat steve blum
[0:12:16] <%Mr_Ease> Code Geass dub is actually superior to sub, only time I've seen it happen
[0:12:17] <%Chatterbox1991> Gundam Wing, Code Geass.
[0:12:17] <+noajenkk> OG version will always be better
[0:12:18] <+zooeymainbtw> subs are mostly still the best
[0:12:19] <%elbigante> "woolie's not anti-dub, that's just how he was brought up"
[0:12:24] <%jiggy_snipe> Ghost Stories Dub tho
[0:12:30] <+hi_imjams> People who watch Cowboy Bebop subbed are nerds
[0:12:32] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> TRUE
[0:12:35] <%chosenjuan42> GHOST STORIES BEST DUB
[0:12:39] <zamzoph> problem with subs is that it's difficult to pseudo-watch anime unless it's something you've already seen before
[0:12:42] <+ConLin_Arts_> DansGame
[0:12:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:12:43] <%Irridium> Ghost in the Shell dubbed is also real good
[0:12:51] <+Mettic> i watched the shin godzilla dub and it was so bad but was really funny
[0:12:52] <Nekros4442> Are we talking about Spike Lee's Old boy?
[0:12:53] <the_saltiest> DansGame
[0:12:54] <%kinetikpaws> EH HEH HEH URAMESHI
[0:12:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> eeee
[0:12:55] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Wait....they dubbed Old Boy??????
[0:12:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> eeeew
[0:12:57] <redrins> jesus why would they dub old boy
[0:12:58] <%DesDavis> I play Metro 2033 in Russian
[0:13:00] <%chosenjuan42> @jiggy_snipe Soo good
[0:13:02] <Prevot> that's a weird thing about north america, cause the rest of the world watches all your movies dubbed
[0:13:02] <%WG101> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz yeah
[0:13:03] <%Josef_Stryker> Baccano has a godlike dub imo
[0:13:04] <RichochetForce> @Irridium That was an amazing group
[0:13:12] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Some dubs also completely make the anime (Ghost Stories and My First Girlfriend's A Gal)
[0:13:17] <+Juriasu> give them the 20-page manual before you recommend the movie
[0:13:17] <+magiclottie> film dubbing is a nightmare
[0:13:20] <%Solidnick18> yeah i can't do that the mouth sync just bothers me
[0:13:21] <brachydios777> Jojo dubbed is still kinda weird but I really like Joseph‚Äôs English VA
[0:13:22] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> Subtitles literally taught me English because I was hearing it in the background
[0:13:29] <+Stormzcales_Lair> First girlfriend is GAL dub is indeed great
[0:13:30] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> I didn't think people were still dubbing love action movies, that's insane.
[0:13:32] <+magiclottie> i also have friends who because of various mental things CANT look at subtitles
[0:13:34] <%prime_name> I never watch anything live-action dubbed
[0:13:37] <overlord_nico> Ladd Russo sold the entirety of Baccano
[0:13:38] <%khalcipher> but thera are times when the subtitles solve voice acting problems like with the star wars prequels and the spanish dub.
[0:13:41] <Equirah> @Corporate_Redeemer those titles alone LUL
[0:13:42] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> live action*
[0:13:46] <+veget188> @WoolieVersus have you seen volcano high dub
[0:13:49] <+GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> that's how my dad is with subtitles
[0:13:54] <%prime_name> Maybe a Godzilla movie, but those are expectations to the rules
[0:13:56] <%gatorafan> But it's not from AMERICA
[0:14:00] <+LoVezineTheAir> Didn't the korean subtitles for Infinity War spoil the ending?
[0:14:02] <Nekros4442> But the Oscars say that only Western movies mean anything
[0:14:07] <%Lion_kun> Ghost of Tsushima japenese doesnt match the mouth flaps
[0:14:14] <%Irridium> if you play video games with subtitles you are more cultured than the majority of movie watchers and the Academy
[0:14:18] <%kyh9> Well Illiteracy rates are pretty high in the US
[0:14:20] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think live-action should be dubbed
[0:14:22] <@akuda_bar> akuda_bar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! live lps are a hoax, reggie wrote all of woolie's lines in advance, including this one, and the one after it.
[0:14:22] <%chosenjuan42> true not a big deal
[0:14:22] <Nekros4442> @Lion_kun developed by an American studio
[0:14:25] <+hi_imjams> @WoolieVersus I prefer dubs for anime/video games but dubbed live action is disgusting
[0:14:29] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @equirah Telling your VAs that the anime is gonna suck anyways and to do whatever they want can lead to some true greatness
[0:14:30] <benbag13> but I want to watch a film not read it
[0:14:34] <+noajenkk> LUL
[0:14:35] <%chosenjuan42> not a big deal but options are good
[0:14:35] <%kinetikpaws> but our american school system sucks people can't read
[0:14:41] <+zooeymainbtw> Gal dub is trash
[0:14:42] <brachydios777> @nekros4442 So glad Parasite won to change some things up
[0:14:43] <%Lion_kun> But its a japanese setting. Be authentic
[0:14:49] <+ConLin_Arts_> I speak Swedish so I spent a lot of my life watching american stuff with Swedish subs
[0:14:54] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Like I've seen it said online, I didn't even notice I was reading subtitles in Parasite, it's so immersive
[0:15:01] <pixel_river> when you get used to subs its nok hard
[0:15:04] <%chosenjuan42> KILL LA KILL is good dub too
[0:15:07] <revoltingimp> literally who, in this community, would argue against subs
[0:15:09] <the_saltiest> fooly cooly!
[0:15:10] <glass_marcus> Agreed
[0:15:17] <%SmoothEnigma> I mean STRONGLY prefer dubs, but even I know when it's time to switch to subbed for something
[0:15:19] <the_saltiest> that's my jam
[0:15:19] <%Irridium> FLCL dub is fucking kills it. It's fantastic
[0:15:22] <%emperordread> Excel Saga is definitely an anime watcher's anime
[0:15:26] <%ChoculaUltra> feeling a bit fooly, maybe a bit cooly idk might delete later

[0:15:36] <%ekodrop> but puni puni poemy though
[0:15:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Like Konosuba?
[0:15:45] <+Ancopro> if its a show i really like I'll watch both versions
[0:15:49] <iccehot1> been watching your kotor 2 play through and its very fun.
[0:15:59] <CybermanAnon> That Excel Saga ending tho!
[0:16:00] <%YakumoYomi> How is Konosuba's dub, by the way?
[0:16:00] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Let's not forget that a LOT of Western anime fans first got introduced to anime through DUBBED DBZ
[0:16:00] <%elbigante> elbigante subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! shoutout to baccano's dub invalidating the sub
[0:16:01] <%ozmon> Cromartie High School dub not only nails how stupidly surreal it is, but makes a brand of its own to paint a whole layer of humor over everything else it has going on
[0:16:02] <+hi_imjams> its all just preference at the end of the day
[0:16:02] <%chosenjuan42> BOBOBO is much more random in dub since he can't do the Japanese puns
[0:16:04] <+StooEsq> Jessica Cavello?
[0:16:08] <scorpionoutcast> Excel Saga felt like taking crack
[0:16:12] <brachydios777> I agree on that stories in foreign nations sound more natural in their native languages, at the least in their accents
[0:16:14] <%paladinstarbuster> Most dubs are fine
[0:16:17] <HereComestheChief> The Konosuba dub is very good

[1:14:10] <noe_juan_kanobe> Sword Pierce

[1:14:20] <twieetcha> Remove first attack
[1:14:22] <MyNameIsRasus> First attack?
[1:14:22] <%SchwaAkari> It can hit the back row, and more importantly it can hit the ceiling
[1:14:22] <hassanico2> Can it hit Clefts and Spiky enemies?
[1:14:23] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Use 2 FP to hit the back Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:14:24] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> first attack
[1:14:24] <Papa_Bearman> First Attack can go.

[1:14:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> first attack isn't useful now
[1:14:29] <SixthSun2> First Attack isn't useful right now
[1:14:30] <niozonbi> And flying enemies
[1:14:32] <+marumariball> yeah first attack
[1:14:33] <+magiclottie> first attack is doing literally nothing right now
[1:14:34] <+Grayhammatter> possibly first attack
[1:14:36] <benbag13> first attack
[1:14:36] <Hyper_charger> first attack sucks
[1:14:36] <%Hawk_Rush> good call!

[1:31:33] <GodlyLuigi> hammer throw is base level damage
[1:31:33] <%TheLemuroid> Doesn't hammer throw = normal hammer
[1:31:34] <damienlunas> Put it on just to try?
[1:31:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> but that was the only thing you tried LUL
[1:31:37] <+TheRisingPride> Hammer throw doesn't do any bonus damage.
[1:31:37] <bbblaketwitching> 1 is less than VIOLENCES base attack
[1:31:38] <%Hawk_Rush> just wait til you level up
[1:31:38] <+Grayhammatter> i think you're pretty good, you'll get a level soon
[1:31:38] <%SchwaAkari> I like how we're just calling them Spiky Joe from now on

[1:31:43] <JeoDood> hammer throw or FP
[1:31:44] <+AJiiij> what does power plus do
[1:31:47] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> any hammer throw is base damage
[1:31:48] <glass_marcus> Power smash is good but you don't use it
[1:31:49] <+Rosen_Thorne> i say ditch charge for mario as the power plus negates it
[1:31:49] <zoopbooploop> Hammer Throw is bad
[1:31:50] <+Wilabeen1997> Hammer throw = normal hammer
[1:31:50] <HiddenDM> Hammer throw is just a regular hammer attack.
[1:31:51] <JetpackMcQuack> I love badges
[1:31:52] <nxflre> but charge and power bounce tho
[1:31:52] <RandomAccess64> Hammer Throw does the same damage as your normal hammer
[1:31:52] <Nyerp> hammer throw is good for the bats
[1:31:55] <+BurningLlama777> Bless you
[1:31:56] <heartlesshealer> hammer throw works for flying enemies is the thing

[1:32:03] <Leddy_at_Home> @AJiiij +1 to damage
[1:32:04] <+AJiiij> good call
[1:32:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Hammer throw is just normal hammer dmg but ranged
[1:32:05] <bbblaketwitching> 1 damage
[1:32:09] <+Rosen_Thorne> it's not bad. it's the same damage.
[1:32:09] <lambishly> Hammer Throw is good
[1:32:10] <BreakersAweigh> hammer throw is great
[1:32:11] <+Grayhammatter> FP plus possibly?
[1:32:12] <heartlesshealer> Hammer throw = anti-air
[1:32:12] <%Totally_Not_Toby> it
[1:32:13] <missingangle> It's really not bad. It's good
[1:32:13] <noe_juan_kanobe> FP?
[1:32:14] <+marumariball> hammer through is good
[1:32:14] <%Hawk_Rush> i think get rid of fire drive, and put quake hammer too
[1:32:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's not bad but it's not better than regular hammer
[1:32:15] <fault_417> Remove the W emblem for this chapter :(
[1:32:15] <shiny_prinny> hammer throw is fine
[1:32:16] <nxflre> charge+power bounce is an OP combo tho
[1:32:18] <%kinetikpaws> i would take off fire drive and hammer throw and get quake hammer/tornado
[1:32:18] <+AJiiij> ah ok thanks leddy
[1:32:20] <HairyRavioliToad> Hammer thro may be good for flying Spiky Joes actually
[1:32:20] <%paladinstarbuster> woolieONEGUY
[1:32:20] <jetboots> what about quake hammer?
[1:32:23] <%Totally_Not_Toby> it's not bad but it's the same amount of damage
[1:32:23] <zoopbooploop> Hammer Throw does the same damage as the regular hammer
[1:32:23] <+magiclottie> hammer throw is good
[1:32:23] <StryfeDragon> You can keep it, just know it does the same damage as your regular hammer
[1:32:24] <+pectusumbra> maybe piercing hammer for right now?
[1:32:26] <%BisoromiBear> the best badges are the ones you enjoy using
[1:32:32] <%eriksdrums> If you hit Z you can sort by FP cost
[1:32:35] <Louie_Salmon> Power Smash isn't very useful when you already have a hammer move
[1:32:37] <Prevot> do you really need power smash
[1:32:39] <%KyoryUtchy> Hammer throw does same damage as regular hammer fyi
[1:32:40] <thetntm> You were using hammer throw incorrectly - it deals the same damage as base hammer
[1:32:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh yeah while we're doing badge stuff, W Emblem breaks stuff in this chapter. Might want to remove it

[1:55:18] <+TheRisingPride> eventually isn't today
[1:55:21] <+NopeBadguy> You can unlock the gate from the inside
[1:55:22] <GodlyLuigi> i do fear woolie is gonna get decked with that 15 hp of his some point later but eh
[1:55:22] <notsoy> is power smash even useful anymore now that we have super hammer?

[1:55:23] <scorpionoutcast> No holding back!
[1:55:25] <pookam> and it neeeever came back as a machanic.......
[1:55:26] <Papa_Bearman> You can unlock that gate from the inside, by the way.
[1:55:27] <Emptyskull> Never not BP
[1:55:32] <nxflre> open gate from other side
[1:55:43] <%cdrom321> Max BP is 30 in PM64, but it's 99 here.

[1:56:12] <Leddy_at_Home> You can change sorting method
[1:56:12] <SixthSun2> Sure, that's solid
[1:56:13] <+NopeBadguy> Remind me, does Quake hit ceiling in this game?
[1:56:16] <Prevot> drop power smash
[1:56:18] <%The_Timo> Tornado Jump is too situational, if the enemies aren't in mid air it hits nothing
[1:56:22] <Papa_Bearman> Tornado is too situational.
[1:56:22] <StryfeDragon> Tornado is very niche imo
[1:56:23] <+Grayhammatter> fair enough
[1:56:25] <+TheRisingPride> Quake does hit ceiling
[1:56:26] <Shwepie> @notsoy Can be, but I think there's more use out of piercing blow.
[1:56:28] <%ividboy> @nopebadguy it does
[1:56:34] <+zooeymainbtw> tornado not great
[1:56:38] <%kinetikpaws> can get rid of fire drive
[1:56:38] <%JD_Lars> Max BP is 99, right?
[1:56:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about piercing?
[1:56:40] <restingbones> what is "something good" woolie? maybe find out?
[1:56:42] <al0nem0nster> too bad they didn't allow build saving, then you could hot swap before fighting.
[1:56:44] <Emptyskull> Tornado only good for flyers
[1:56:45] <noe_juan_kanobe> Tornado stylish is dope, tho
[1:56:54] <pookam> tornado has an ankle bracelet
[1:56:54] <@akuda_bar> now people will stop saying that 30 BP is the cap
[1:56:56] <+NopeBadguy> Fire Drive is only useful against elemental weaknesses, which is too rare in this game
[1:57:01] <RandomAccess64> You can unlock the gate from the inside
[1:57:04] <%chosenjuan42> The gate can open from inside
[1:57:08] <+NopeBadguy> Isn't the cap 99
[1:57:09] <@Menitta> lol you can get 99 bp
[1:57:09] <the_saltiest> @akuda_bar That's PM 64 :p

[2:09:55] <+desfore> the Swirl is a Dizzy DIal item

[2:11:05] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus if you time the hammer when it hits the star immediately, you execute the freeze attack. There's basically a perfect timing and a good timing.
[2:11:07] <pookam> hmmmm
[2:11:07] <+BurningLlama777> Robert Stack is incredible and I hate him for giving me nightmares
[2:11:07] <%chosenjuan42> or koops
[2:11:09] <damienlunas> Koops would also have worked I think
[2:11:09] <%CursedNobleman> hmm, i dont remember that stained glass
[2:11:10] <%Doplghost> I love stained glass
[2:11:10] <%BisoromiBear> nice hops
[2:11:10] <Mako_Kreutzev> that stained glass is whack
[2:11:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh yeah the window is super cool and creepy
[2:11:16] <morat2255> koops is safer
[2:11:17] <+AJiiij> I dont remember this part lol

[2:11:18] <%tigerfang86> creepy glass
[2:11:19] <hassanico2> Is the middle door just a trap?
[2:11:24] <+desfore> Yup
[2:11:25] <%chosenjuan42> either or
[2:11:25] <Jalexster> I'm gonna be honest, I was expecting you to fuck that flutter jump up LUL
[2:11:28] <Papa_Bearman> Woolie has an affinity for VIOLENCE.
[2:11:28] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[2:11:29] <GodlyLuigi> flurrie aint no child lol
[2:11:29] <+CptBritches> :)
[2:11:30] <%kingkeldeo31> don't go through middle door
[2:11:31] <pookam> goombella for the sass
[2:11:32] <damienlunas> "I don't care for koops..."
[2:11:32] <twieetcha> That is a cool window
[2:11:33] <%Hawk_Rush> ... except you koops
[2:11:33] <the_saltiest> this chapter is so cool :D
[2:11:33] <bbblaketwitching> except flurrie
[2:11:35] <SixthSun2> Yes, Flurrie, your BBW child
[2:11:35] <%Asuterisuku> I love you all equally.
[2:11:38] <grimshuck> @hassanico2 yup
[2:11:39] <%BestTeaMaker> basically, the freeze hammer only works if you're really good at the action command and can time it perfectly
[2:11:39] <%Asuterisuku> But I love you the most.
[2:11:43] <morat2255> hit button twice
[2:11:46] <%kingkeldeo31> I tried

[2:11:55] <%Hawk_Rush> PauseChamp
[2:11:56] <+NopeBadguy> Violence and Goombella are the favorites
[2:11:56] <twieetcha> One@more
[2:11:56] <+Jaysky> Goombella got that lore buff
[2:11:57] <GamecubesGiganticAButton> correct
[2:11:58] <the_saltiest> woolie figured it out
[2:12:02] <+desfore> Correcy
[2:12:03] <+Euphbugg> good woolie
[2:12:03] <Nyerp> too smart to fall for it
[2:12:06] <morat2255> Woolie is the smrt
[2:12:06] <%Mr_Ease> But if anything happened to VIOLENCE you would kill everyone and then yourself
[2:12:09] <+zooeymainbtw> good job
[2:12:12] <Mrbaconator> flurrie is no kid
[2:12:22] <+NopeBadguy> Flurrie is the wife
[2:12:30] <+NopeBadguy> She's the stepmom
[2:12:32] <Leddy_at_Home> THE BOY
[2:12:33] <SixthSun2> That window tho

[2:12:49] <%chiluzza> florrie is the hot stepmom
[2:12:50] <CybermanAnon> NEVER AGAIN!
[2:12:53] <+NopeBadguy> Yes they are
[2:12:53] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yes?
[2:12:53] <%MontresorMeal> such a creepy place...
[2:12:55] <%Asuterisuku> Is it creepy, or does he just want a hug?
[2:12:55] <+desfore> I wonder who that creepy face could be....
[2:12:56] <bbblaketwitching> ANOTHER
[2:12:56] <pookam> TY
[2:12:57] <%kingkeldeo31> yes
[2:13:00] <%doomerskeletor13> A Grand Wizard you might say...
[2:13:01] <+TheRisingPride> Tornado Uppa!
[2:13:01] <+stellarseeker> I'm sure that will never be relevant again
[2:13:02] <%chosenjuan42> yes?
[2:13:03] <Emptyskull> Slow shroom

[2:13:09] <morat2255> Hey bro, you forgot to bring a sheet? I got an extra.
[2:13:09] <hoodedlefty> my boi ???, best boss personality
[2:13:10] <damienlunas> wow, only 2?
[2:13:11] <bbblaketwitching> @lewdskeletor13 ty
[2:13:12] <Nyerp> 2 dmg? oof
[2:13:13] <sleepy_pixels> So many people in the backseat, woolie is driving a bus
[2:13:13] <%SomersaultJustice> ...did that boo throw their panties at mario?
[2:13:14] <+Euphbugg> 2 dmg, nto that good
[2:13:16] <+NopeBadguy> If they're not in contact with the ground, they're airborne, even if they're ground level @WoolieVersus
[2:13:16] <atomicxdj> Violence
[2:13:17] <+thunka10> weak sauce
[2:13:17] <Nyerp> unequip that
[2:13:18] <2017y> is woolie at the 25% mark or the 75% mark of the chapter
[2:13:18] <Papa_Bearman> VIOLENCE
[2:13:18] <GamecubesGiganticAButton> ok so good for lots of flying enemies
[2:13:19] <2017y> did i miss it
[2:13:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damage is weak
[2:13:22] <+desfore> Eh
[2:13:22] <boti_balint> you have to see the stylish move for this
[2:13:25] <+zooeymainbtw> get that shiz off
[2:13:27] <twieetcha> That‚Äôs kinda weak
[2:13:27] <%MontresorMeal> it is a mystery
[2:13:30] <citerel> its too little damage for 2 bp
[2:13:31] <+Wilabeen1997> VIOLENCE
[2:13:31] <%kinetikpaws> the style is awesome
[2:13:32] <pory_z> 25%
[2:13:39] <GodlyLuigi> the initial hit also deals 5 tho
[2:13:41] <Papa_Bearman> Not worth it, yeah.
[2:13:44] <+desfore> I've never seen that attack before.....
[2:13:46] <+AJiiij> get the stylish first and then take it off
[2:13:48] <chromdad> Well dang
[2:13:49] <%ividboy> most of the time multibounce is better
[2:13:49] <%chosenjuan42> only good if you stack a lot
[2:13:56] <Papa_Bearman> Take off the W Emblem!!

[2:14:41] <%Solidnick18> flower saver?
[2:14:41] <JeoDood> for saver
[2:14:42] <morat2255> buffs are better than options imo, but I know that's not your playstyle.
[2:14:42] <roguemephilesclone> Assuming I wasn't tricked by One Guy, last call on W Emblem.
[2:14:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Charge?
[2:14:46] <bbblaketwitching> flower saver is life to be fair
[2:14:46] <Potatoidea> Tornado Jump always felt a little redundant with Multibounce also existing, imo
[2:14:47] <Mrbda241> So the Manga is this far in
[2:14:50] <%Asuterisuku> First Attack is like in Earthbound.

It is the only MMO where you can knock an enemy through a pillar then pick up a piece of that pillar and club him with it. Also it has summon swords the class and another class that plays like a better version of DMC4 Lady.

[3:19:19] <%CursedNobleman> Y is the right button LUL
[3:19:22] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> monkaS
[3:19:25] <%Asuterisuku> Y is the top button on the Gamecube controller.
[3:19:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dodge charge hits
[3:19:27] <+thunka10> Y becomes the left button @woolieversus
[3:19:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie probably using a madcats controller or something EleGiggle
[3:19:31] <pmmori> this uses two turns
[3:19:32] <+desfore> Use it second!
[3:19:36] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:19:36] <+linSP> take a closer look at your GameCube controller
[3:19:37] <%PKSomething> You should use Mario first
[3:19:38] <Millionton> wrong order
[3:19:38] <+AJiiij> super cheap too
[3:19:41] <%tigerfang86> it uses mario's turn so you gotta use it second
[3:19:42] <+Euphbugg> use mario first then use that
[3:19:45] <lambishly> Use it second
[3:19:45] <reonome> use it second
[3:19:45] <+Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Using veil also waste's mario's turn
[3:19:45] <%Omnicen> also yeah use it second
[3:19:46] <DeepSearch27> Attack and hide
[3:19:49] <pmmori> use mario first before doing it
[3:19:56] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Use it second. You can do Mario's attack first then Viel or else you waste a turn
[3:20:00] <%CursedNobleman> its like a free second turn!
[3:20:00] <+TheRisingPride> Always hide 2nd if possible so you don't lose your attack
[3:20:03] <%cdrom321> Better than shell shield
[3:20:04] <damienlunas> Veil is also super cheap so don't be afraid to use it
[3:20:14] <%Nomad94> üëç
[3:20:17] <christopherwpoindexter> üôåüèª
[3:20:21] <morat2255> Veil is kinda incredible

[3:20:31] <Papa_Bearman> And equipping Flower Saver P makes Veil free.
[3:20:31] <+AbnormalVoid> it doesn't matter, you either get one turn before using veil, or one turn afterwards, you don't get both @WoolieVersus
[3:20:32] <+agumon9000> Viel is super cheap, hard to fuck up. Its one of the strongest partner moves
[3:20:32] <%CursedNobleman> ü¶∂ü¶∂ü¶∂
[3:20:33] <%jiggy_snipe> punch him

[3:23:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> there's apparently an a press as you go back into the ground??
[3:23:50] <noe_juan_kanobe> Theh were Xnauts
[3:23:50] <+AJiiij> I forget if fire stacks
[3:23:58] <MayorRev> i believe its after she warps back to her original spot @WoolieVersus
[3:23:59] <morat2255> One of those will die on their own
[3:24:03] <%kingkeldeo31> after she goes back near mario
[3:24:04] <%sunnythedrunk> She's kinda the best
[3:24:05] <DatAsuna> he is already dead

[3:24:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:24:17] <DeepSearch27> Most of them are X-nauts anyway
[3:24:17] <+TheRisingPride> I think the stylish on that one was after she reappears next to mario
[3:24:19] <+Ancopro> you can't hammer backrow
[3:24:19] <+AsinPersuasion> oh yeah
[3:24:20] <%baronblank> woolie why didn;t you attack with vivian first
[3:24:22] <hassanico2> He means Punch into Hammer
[3:24:27] <thetntm> hammer throw
[3:24:28] <ElbyBoxus> lethal was swap viv to punch then hammer
[3:24:32] <sirmcslushers> I 'THINK' Vivian can attack anyone, not just front row?
[3:24:35] <shiny_prinny> chat wrong
[3:24:37] <hassanico2> BLAH
[3:24:38] <damienlunas> Could have done it by killing the first one with Viv and second with Mario but it's cool
[3:24:40] <@akuda_bar> she can attack anywhere yes
[3:24:41] <MayorRev> OH JEEZ
[3:24:41] <+AngelYoumou> @WoolieVersus FYI, Vivian can stretch to punch aerial enemies too.
[3:24:51] <+AJiiij> vivian can attack anyone, I think
[3:24:58] <roguemephilesclone> And here's the great part: Vivian can attack almost anything, anywhere. Only front spikes stop her.
[3:25:01] <%MontresorMeal> Mistakes are also a part of LPs.
[3:25:04] <+AsinPersuasion> shadow waifu
[3:25:16] <%MontresorMeal> I've come to accept that since getting my ass blown out.

[3:25:32] <mar_krow> curse powers
[3:25:37] <%kingkeldeo31> Then you level her up and get an AOE
[3:25:38] <+Huttersson> I think she can attack flying or hanging enemies too.
[3:25:39] <MayorRev> gotcha you flower fuck
[3:25:42] <DeepSearch27> Are the fights worth it right now?

[3:37:51] <@akuda_bar> take quick change off for the vine
[3:37:52] <HiddenDM> Fair point
[3:37:53] <al0nem0nster> may need it for the buff, due to not having your options.
[3:37:53] <%Chatterbox1991> yes
[3:37:54] <+zooeymainbtw> tru
[3:37:56] <%Proxzo> but then he'd have to do a bunch of stuff later

[3:38:04] <grimshuck> He would forget
[3:38:05] <%jiggy_snipe> either now or later
[3:38:06] <%kinetikpaws> but then he has to stop and do it later
[3:38:06] <%SchwaAkari> Woolie's got a point, but on the other hand you're getting more BP later

[3:38:10] <%marshalmorphino2> Take it for a test drive
[3:38:10] <SpaceLTN> but you might level soon tho
[3:38:11] <twieetcha> Lmao
[3:38:17] <%stormhawk9891> But then you'd forget
[3:38:20] <+agumon9000> You can get more BP later
[3:38:20] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> paper mario rewards temporary builds
[3:38:20] <HiddenDM> THinking ahead
[3:38:21] <Papa_Bearman> If I unequipped Quick Change, I'd forget to re-equip it anyway.
[3:38:21] <+AnthraxJohnson> SUBOPTIMAL
[3:38:22] <HairyRavioliToad> He's going to have to do this at some point anyway
[3:38:22] <%kingkeldeo31> Permant builds are dumb, just change things up every now and then
[3:38:26] <+zooeymainbtw> fire and happy can go
[3:38:26] <+Euphbugg> if you gonna do it might as well do it now then have to do it again later
[3:38:29] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie is Woolieing
[3:38:29] <MyNameIsRasus> That's fine too I gues

[3:38:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> We're going to have that discussion anyway
[3:38:38] <Shwepie> If you could save multiple badge loadouts I could see removing Quick Change, otherwise nah too lazy.
[3:38:40] <DeepSearch27> Woolie could take off quick change, and then he'll probably gain a level and build BP
[3:38:44] <%marshalmorphino2> Or at least one guy will
[3:38:45] <+AJiiij> yeah just figure it out, woolies right
[3:38:46] <MyNameIsRasus> ? You already have enough
[3:38:47] <%baronblank> you already have enough bp though
[3:38:47] <christopherwpoindexter> @jetpackmcquack LUL AMEN TO THAT
[3:38:47] <%Asuterisuku> It's only 6BP.

[3:39:14] <Papa_Bearman> Last Stand, I say.
[3:39:20] <+AJiiij> W emblem is why hes yellow

[3:43:50] <+desfore> The P was missing
[3:43:50] <%Exiliator> Did Woolie not notice?
[3:43:51] <+Ancopro> it wasnt there in the text box before
[3:43:51] <%SomersaultJustice> it's so you can't put in the name if you happened to know it earlier
[3:43:52] <+Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus If you tried to type his name, the P was missing in the letter selection
[3:43:52] <SixthSun2> It was missing from your keyboard @WoolieVersus
[3:43:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so you can't guess even if you knew
[3:43:53] <%kingkeldeo31> lowercase p was missing
[3:43:54] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus when you were on the name input screen you couldn't select lower case p
[3:43:55] <+VorpalSlash> It wasn't on the keyboard
[3:43:55] <BooitsDock> HE STOLE THE ACTUAL P LETTER WHEN YOU HAD TO TYPE HIS NAME IN @WoolieVersus
[3:43:56] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> The p is missing so that it's literally impossible for you to guess right on repeat playthroughs
[3:43:56] <twieetcha> Now that you have the pickle stone finish that guy off!
[3:43:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus the lowercase p is missing from your keyboard

[3:44:01] <pmmori> can
[3:44:02] <%FistTheWizard> it was litetally missing from the alphabet
[3:44:02] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> The P is missing to prevent you from guessing it early
[3:44:02] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie didn't notice.
[3:44:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @deepsearch27 this is straight up lying too, not even a whoopsie
[3:44:03] <+AbnormalVoid> There was no "p" in the "Enter Name" menu
[3:44:03] <+Thunderhog> So you cant even type his name even if you knew it before playing
[3:44:04] <+TheRisingPride> In the input screen before, lowercase p wasn't on the list
[3:44:05] <+harrisboe> @woolieversus it was missing from the name input screen
[3:44:05] <%baronblank> the p was missing from the name select screen when guessing his name
