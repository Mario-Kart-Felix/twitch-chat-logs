[0:03:23] <%Nested_Dreams> jphAngrysip
[0:03:25] <+Setsuna_seiei> @weiliheng we'll see.  but Kingdom is really well designed in retrospect. so fun. it's not journys fault that kingdom was so good
[0:03:27] <%saladin1911> Oh My God, Minh looks great for 92 years old
[0:03:28] <+Vigonept> You dont look younger than 105
[0:03:28] <Ipsenscastle> He's aging RAPIDLY
[0:03:31] <KeiganOfAstora> Minh was born the same year Dark Souls 1 came out. 1924
[0:03:33] <nabs96> OK so when did the old Minh bit originate lol
[0:03:37] <Goldteddy> He was there, at the dawn of all things
[0:03:37] <lbrownthedestroyer> Minh one year from retire killed by the Salt PJSalt PJSalt
[0:03:37] <Champstice> Min looking good for a fresh 420
[0:03:38] <SheefEatsBeef> i know i sound like a broken record, but 89 years?
[0:03:39] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Woolie's couch is the beach from Old

[0:03:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Hell and Hell
[0:03:58] <WeiLiHeng> @setsuna_seiei certainly. Journey also has the advantage of being the game *after* Kingdom, so we shall see.
[0:04:01] <BigFingerRo> Nowadays you wanna beat Fuudo
[0:04:06] <Arqartur0> funny enough, I've been asked "Are you THE Arturo Sanchez!?" Because that is my name :l
[0:04:07] <dds333a> Hell and Hell, too
[0:04:07] <%RyTYoung> I would've said BP
[0:04:10] <+Shishi1205> Hell and Hell
[0:04:14] <lbrownthedestroyer> DMC 2 Helitoper tower level
[0:04:15] <+megamanx74> They need to bring this game to the switch
[0:04:17] <MugenSandan> Completing UWU is more like getting top 32 at Evo
[0:04:18] <goroke> the most difficult thing in DMC, but you need 7 other people to NOT FUCK IT UP to clear the Ultimates in XIV
[0:04:20] <andre11dr> Vergil 3 DMD?
[0:04:25] <dds333a> Heaven and Hell is the othe
[0:04:28] <%Bluwizard21> Bluwizard21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! hell and hell fresh run
[0:04:31] <+IxDomxI> heaven and hell is everyone dies in one hit
[0:04:31] <BigFingerRo> or maybe Mago
[0:04:31] <nabs96> hell and hell for me personally is the most difficult
[0:04:32] <turboyabo> bloody palace, you mean dante must die
[0:04:32] <KyberNasse> More like 6 Daigos ganging up on you
[0:04:33] <%Gamefriendly> in 5 at least. ive found dmd to be harder than h&h
[0:04:38] <leith_aziz> Is it like really hard or just bullshit?
[0:04:38] <+IxDomxI> hell and hell is you die in one hit but they dont
[0:04:42] <leith_aziz> If hard, I'
[0:04:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, Ultimate is solo?
[0:04:50] <BigFingerRo> I'd love to beat Mago just to see the dumb faces he makes
[0:04:51] <jorniev> NERO beat up dante and vergil GO
[0:04:54] <%RyTYoung> Mihn did you have a set party or randoms?
[0:04:58] <+Setsuna_seiei> imagine bloody palace but it's hell or hell mode from floor 1
[0:04:59] <leith_aziz> *id say Vergil 3. If bullshit, I'd say Mundus last fight or Arkham boss
[0:05:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh no,I misheard him, my bad
[0:05:04] <dds333a> @gamefriendly same, that's why I default to it LUL
[0:05:08] <%Bluwizard21> you cant do randoms on this
[0:05:09] <+SilverDevilfish> At least it's not 24 other people
[0:05:15] <andre11dr> You need 8 people to play perfectly, i see....
[0:05:22] <WrongIM> what was that song from early that was like "fly awayyyy something wind blowww"
[0:05:23] <andre11dr> That seems like hell
[0:05:24] <Nekros4442> Its literally a 20 minute dance you need to get perfect
[0:05:26] <%Dapper_Cactuar> ultimates in FF14 are no joke
[0:05:35] <WrongIM> i can't find it anywhere :<
[0:05:36] <+Jiggisnipe> damn they were labbing for real
[0:05:40] <DigiDom> LUL
[0:05:42] <%Dapper_Cactuar> they are a GAUNTLET
[0:05:54] <dds333a> Jist like a dance performance
[0:05:56] <%jinking79> the real secret boss in Yakuza 7 in up there
[0:06:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> I don't think it's possible to beat Ultimate with randos
[0:06:13] <+thesickestzak> Defeated Amon lol
[0:06:16] <andre11dr> "You playing with the Black Gift" Woolie 2021

[0:06:42] <masterfire23> black gift comeback when?
[0:06:44] <+Setsuna_seiei> @cappuccinoguil it is. not complete randos blind though. BLIND randos you might as well just give up.
[0:07:01] <Asuterisuku> Overwatch? More like Overworkplaceharrassment
[0:07:12] <+Setsuna_seiei> but with PF randos? yes. UCoB and UWU are at the point of farmables
[0:07:20] <dds333a> that's the point of Gon Kappa

[0:11:12] <noelsbedroom> @leith_aziz PREACH
[0:11:17] <ZorenMaximus> Imagine if they port Demon's Soul before BloodBorne Kappa
[0:11:19] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe they are
[0:11:21] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz nicobFive1 nicobFive2
[0:11:24] <andre11dr> I always said that if DeS got a Remake it would be top 3 Souls for me
[0:11:29] <@Menitta> nah a port would suffice
[0:11:33] <yukichocomilk> no need to remake, just port in 60fps please
[0:11:37] <Ipsenscastle> The only port exclusives to PC to drum up excitement for a sequel. There's no Bloodborne sequel on the cards, so they're better off holding onto it for an updated exclusive version
[0:11:46] <dds333a> too early, yeah
[0:11:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Why not a sequel with Pc port confirm?
[0:11:50] <Arqartur0> ... Like Diablo 2 remastered?
[0:11:56] <+karldeck> The last of us got an remaster within a year
[0:11:58] <%SveriSageAdvice> The Last of Us 1 was the first one i said that it was way too damn soon for
[0:11:58] <%Dapper_Cactuar> if only we could get a remaster of Kuon
[0:12:03] <%RyTYoung> if they just update the ps5 to have variable refresh rate it might help bborne be playable on ps5
[0:12:13] <@Menitta> they are putting Uncharted 4 on pc though
[0:12:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> Bro, Bloodborne is nearly 7 years old. TIME IS PASSING, WE OLD
[0:12:19] <+polothegreatest> convinence>piracy TPFufun
[0:12:21] <@Menitta> and that has no sequel
[0:12:21] <kratostheboi> i would love to see shadow of colossus come to pc.
[0:12:23] <KyberNasse> Cant wait to play Bloodborne remake in my retirement LUL if the world exists anymore
[0:12:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm crumbling into dust
[0:12:32] <%mitchteck> Y no bloodborne cart
[0:12:34] <%jinking79> probably when bloodborne server shut down remake will come
[0:12:40] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is questionably the most iconic PS4 game
[0:12:43] <leith_aziz> Hardest or most bullshit?
[0:12:47] <+Shishi1205> The turn around and feel the wind blow is from Valkyrie Vanguard btw
[0:12:53] <WrongIM> @shishi1205 YES is that the name of the song? i legit can't find it anywhere. all im finding is Roll's Tvs.C theme
[0:13:00] <leith_aziz> If we talking most bullshit, there's final Mundus fight or Arkham boss

[0:20:27] <+Shishi1205> Its very low?

[0:20:59] <leith_aziz> seems good?
[0:20:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> People forget it's important to have good comeback mechanics in competitive games because if a player feels they have NO chance, the competition dies out.

[0:21:03] <ZorenMaximus> it's good
[0:21:09] <+Shishi1205> yeah good
[0:21:10] <+aishman> @woolieversus The come back mechanic is everyone banding together to fuck one player. Also some of the alien power is just legit "I don't lose. I win when I lose."

[2:30:17] <andre11dr> Minh, meteors did nothing because you have no magic
[2:30:25] <dds333a> @shishi1205 yep, and the mindgame worked
[2:30:27] <%probably_facetious> Magic is a deep weakness atm. Take reflect to nullify it
[2:30:45] <dds333a> They would NEVER throw magic for fear of reflection
[2:31:04] <randominternetsurfer> GET REFLECT WOOLIE

[2:33:16] <+Shishi1205> Reggie getting godlike items when he has the bat is hilarious
[2:33:19] <andre11dr> That turn felt like 4 years LUL
[2:33:52] <dds333a> He got bored and left LUL
[2:33:56] <andre11dr> Even the bat wants nothing to do with Reggie
[2:34:08] <glass_marcus> I miss the days when Reggie casted magic
[2:34:14] <drunken_lemur> It's a Baron Munchausen story.
[2:34:28] <+Shishi1205> Poison time
[2:34:30] <Asuterisuku> It's why it's weird when Conservatives bring it up as a reason to keep people poor.
[2:34:33] <%Irridium> That's what it was literally used for at first. To describe something as being impossible. But then jackasses started saying it for real.

[3:00:46] <+twenty112> Probably because human mouths are filthy
[3:00:52] <andre11dr> Yeah, sucking poison is not a good idea
[3:01:01] <X2Eliah> The right thing to do is to take a knife and cut the hole wide open to let it bleed out

[3:02:16] <+pectusumbra> Tank-a-minh is fine
[3:02:18] <$Spydurman> safest bet is using a belt to cut off circulation to the bite
[3:02:26] <grouchio> Three and a half men
[3:02:33] <+Shishi1205> @Spydurman what is the word for this in english
[3:02:35] <EaseTheSquirrel> had to leave a little bit through the stream, during the brb hopefully I'm not too far behind
[3:02:45] <user_naim> and keep the limb below the hart i guess
[3:02:46] <ChrisPlaysThing> tourniquet?
[3:02:48] <+Shishi1205> Tourniquet
[3:02:58] <andre11dr> I don't even get sucking does anything, the poison would already be spreading trew the bodies
[3:02:58] <%Lion_kun> But what if the snake bit you on the dick?

[3:31:36] <NoviceArtist4090> Magic man doesn’t wanna increase his magic
[3:31:38] <+pectusumbra> For the audience: Reggie's class gets 1 defense and 1 magic every level I believe, then his points
[3:31:40] <JetpackMcQuack> great answer

[3:32:40] <+pectusumbra> @emMmDeeKay 1 atk, 1 spd
[3:33:06] <+pectusumbra> and Minh's paladin gets 10 HP and 1 defense.
[3:33:12] <emMmDeeKay> That's a good stat, considering the previous game
[3:33:25] <emMmDeeKay> no wonder Pockets is sweeping
[3:33:34] <+Shishi1205> close
[3:33:38] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:33:42] <+Grayhammatter> that was close
[3:33:47] <rommlll> yo new dokage season?
[3:33:58] <+Shishi1205> having 59 attak is paying off
[3:34:15] <dds333a> big damage
[3:34:44] <+pectusumbra> passively: Amazon can regain HP before getting into fights,  Mage can 'catch field magic other players cast'  Paladin 'may take less damage from field magic'
[3:34:45] <MysticMismagius13> how did pockets get so rich btw
[3:35:01] <dds333a> Woolz finished the chapter quest

[3:37:17] <JeoDood> GOOD READ
[3:37:20] <%xcompleasedad> He smelled the game, and it chose reckless violence
[3:37:23] <Arqartur0> A spite-win!?
[3:37:25] <+pectusumbra> But yeah, reggie's character CAN do stuff if he gets actual attack and field magic
[3:37:54] <+pectusumbra> Minh's character can turbo tank, and Woolie's tank is aggressive phys sweeper

[3:38:33] <+pectusumbra> oh! I thought yellow chests were money. shows what I know

[3:38:57] <andre11dr> @pectusumbra Turbo tank with what? He has one point in defense

[3:39:22] <+pectusumbra> @andre11dr his class gets defense and HP every level, and he gets a permanent skill to recover 2/3rd of his HP
[3:39:37] <+Setsuna_seiei> if Minh started pumping health and defense/magic he'd be a juggernaut

[3:39:40] <+Grayhammatter> hoo boy, here we go
[3:39:43] <ColeDingo> is this game better than OG dokapon?
[3:39:56] <andre11dr> Minh put all his points in spd ,when he should've built defense and health
[3:39:57] <+Shishi1205> No way
[3:40:00] <ColeDingo> woah that dark elf tho
[3:40:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie needs to buy himself some magic ASAP after the fight

[3:40:19] <dds333a> Let's see if it works next LUL
[3:40:35] <+pectusumbra> @ColeDingo it's a bit older since it's apparently a port/remake of a snes game. I like the sprites and the classes are neat but Kingdom's got more going on

[4:23:21] <+pectusumbra> @andre11dr again, if reggie gathers right now he'd put them on the chest and they wouldn't fight
[4:23:29] <dds333a> @mynameisrasus it removes Curse
[4:23:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie can still gather
[4:23:51] <randominternetsurfer> @jiggisnipe So can Woolie
[4:23:53] <MyNameIsRasus> My god if Reggie gather on the chest Woolie deserves the W LUL
[4:23:57] <andre11dr> @pectusumbra But at least his close to him
[4:23:59] <Solidnick18> be smart
[4:24:11] <+pectusumbra> there's a LOT of time to gather honestly since penny has to go back to the castle

[4:25:09] <%RyTYoung> that D is starting to stand more for dunce now LUL
[4:25:17] <+pectusumbra> reggie just gotta be patient
[4:25:28] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie just be patient
[4:25:32] <+pectusumbra> gotta get as strong as he can and weaken pockets as much as possible
[4:25:33] <andre11dr> THAT WAS DEFINITELY A HIGHLIGHT
[4:25:39] <+Grayhammatter> gotta be patient my dude
[4:25:41] <+Jiggisnipe> just keep in mind how close he is to the castle
[4:25:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "The jerk store called, and they're running out of you!"
[4:25:53] <MyNameIsRasus> @pectusumbra but if he waits too long woolie can level up and heal to full
[4:25:55] <andre11dr> Ok ,didn't level up
[4:25:56] <+Jiggisnipe> hell maybe even level again to get more magic
[4:26:14] <+pectusumbra> @MyNameIsRasus yes but reggie can get stronger, buff up, pick up field magic, and things like that
[4:26:14] <andre11dr> I'd just gather now

[4:26:37] <yeildingthought> LUL
[4:27:07] <+Jiggisnipe> now Reggie is thinking
[4:27:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> that'd be... oof
[4:27:24] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL that would suck
[4:27:27] <+Grayhammatter> that'd be rough
[4:27:32] <andre11dr> Not if he levels up
[4:27:33] <+pectusumbra> I'd assume not, but this is old dokapon, so WHO KNOWS
[4:27:34] <dds333a> I doubt it, but then again LUL
[4:27:37] <MyNameIsRasus> That would be so funny
[4:27:40] <%saladin1911> That sounds like a Dokapon thing tho tbh lmao
[4:28:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> I don't think it would, but I want it to
[4:28:04] <+pectusumbra> pockets is also high enough level that random trash fights probably won't level up
[4:28:04] <dds333a> In kingdom, at least, escorts always traveled with the player
[4:28:20] <dds333a> but here, fuck, who knows LUL

[4:29:13] <Parapattern> ARE YOU KIDDING ME
[4:29:14] <%saladin1911> sorry what
[4:29:15] <+pectusumbra> one level up with 3 speed should cover the gap honestly
[4:29:16] <topendbuzza> woolie shut the fuck up
[4:29:17] <Visorak6> what
[4:29:20] <%TheBensonator_> WUT
[4:29:27] <Carlioo> I mean, is it good?
[4:29:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Is it fire?
[4:29:32] <dds333a> athletes do that shit from time to time LUL
[4:29:35] <ChrisPlaysThing> Is it as good/bad as Bam margera's?
[4:29:39] <andre11dr> Like he understands that if Woolie wins one more fight his fucked right?
[4:29:53] <+Grayhammatter> oh no LUL
[4:29:55] <topendbuzza> HECK YEAH

[4:30:10] <+pectusumbra> @andre11dr reggie does have a revive, don't forget
[4:30:11] <Solidnick18> i guess
[4:30:19] <+pectusumbra> It wouldn't be a sure thing
[4:30:26] <+Jiggisnipe> @andre11dr we don't know. 1. Reggie has a revive, 2 he has heckfire, 3. he has defense
[4:30:40] <+DACH33ZMAN> tune in tomorrow for more flubs!
[4:30:43] <%saladin1911> That's the spirit, Minh LUL
[4:30:48] <andre11dr> Like just gather, if you lose you losr
[4:30:52] <stormhawk9891> For now
[4:30:52] <+pectusumbra> and minh can just chase woolie as well
[4:30:55] <+smallboops> petition to rename the stream to FLUBLORDS
[4:30:59] <+cgkonnor> Minh doesn't have a strong grindset that'll help him win the game

[4:31:54] <MyNameIsRasus> ITSUMO CHASE YOU
[4:31:55] <+pectusumbra> because if minh catches woolie it's the same thing again. Mind games and the chance that Minh steals his HP again

[4:32:01] <dds333a> Cee lo mindgame again Kappa
[4:32:06] <+Jiggisnipe> just chase him
[4:32:07] <andre11dr> I really don't get why Reggie doesn't just gather, Woolie is low on life and he has a revival
[4:32:23] <dds333a> By Kohei Kadono
[4:32:29] <+Jiggisnipe> @andre11dr Reggie has only been on item spots, it would be a waste right now
[4:32:32] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean, if Reggie's gonna gather, then he doesn't need to chase
[4:32:35] <+Shishi1205> and hol horse baby

[4:35:56] <andre11dr> Reggie played really dumb here
[4:36:01] <dds333a> they're smelling salts, to my knowledge
[4:36:04] <MrATheGreat> I love how Beartrap is labeled as a "Prank"
[4:36:08] <sapphomet777> or is he being a heel
[4:36:15] <andre11dr> He let Woolie move around when he could've gathered
[4:36:19] <ChrisPlaysThing> It's just a prank, bro
[4:36:26] <stoatacious> prank your friends with a beartrap
[4:36:29] <+Shishi1205> Woolie the telewarp
[4:36:30] <dds333a> @mrathegreat haha, gotcha, now you have to amputate Kappa
[4:36:32] <sapphomet777> dare i ask what pranks do
[4:36:33] <+Jiggisnipe> alright Reggie needs to move to a blank spot if he wants to gather next turn
[4:36:39] <stoatacious> you'll e lauging all the way to the ER
[4:36:44] <randominternetsurfer> WOOLIE, the Telewarp
[4:36:47] <+pectusumbra> Again, if reggie gathers while on a chest or money space they won't fight
[4:36:53] <+silvery_cricket> Is there a pot of money I can donate to, so this gets saltier?

[4:37:43] <user_naim> @silvery_cricket i think we set up the blood pool, right guys?
[4:38:09] <andre11dr> @pectusumbra That doesn't matter, he should still get Woolie next to him instead of letting him run around possibly getting level up or portions
[4:38:22] <MrATheGreat> Oh hell yes please tell me there's a blood pool still
[4:38:24] <+DACH33ZMAN> Minhs in the FeelsBad zone
[4:38:33] <+Shishi1205> Oh if telewarp is like kingdom it was random yeah
[4:38:47] <user_naim> i wasn’t paying that close attention
[4:38:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @andre11dr it does matter cuz there is no guarantee he'll get a battle, he needs to get on a blank spot before he gathers
[4:39:03] <TreeLeafBoi> @DACH33ZMAN I'm there with him rn
[4:39:23] <andre11dr> YOU HAVE A REVIVE
[4:39:30] <+Shishi1205> @andre11dr Reveal
[4:39:32] <MrATheGreat> wait does woolie need a lockpick since he's a thief?
[4:39:32] <%saladin1911> And yea, are Reg said, Woolie's one-shot potential is insane so having him near is a risk anyway
[4:39:35] <+DACH33ZMAN> @DACH33ZMAN Same but I got some Wendys now we good
[4:39:46] <+pectusumbra> it's not like woolie is going to be at the castle RIGHT now either
[4:39:54] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Woolie may one shot Reggie but Reggie does have high defense
[4:39:57] <dds333a> LUL
[4:40:05] <MrATheGreat> Woolie's too much of a threat to confront head on imo
[4:40:07] <andre11dr> Dose reveal really work multiple times? That's bs
[4:40:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[4:40:20] <+Jiggisnipe> oh fuck
[4:40:21] <+DACH33ZMAN> Does that dude have halo swords???
[4:40:22] <+Shishi1205> Reggie doesnt remember woolie has a reveal

[4:40:51] <rosemon5001> thats legally destinct ninja blade LUL
[4:40:52] <+Shishi1205> heckfire is strong

[4:40:53] <dds333a> they flow in the wind LUL
[4:40:53] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie might 1 hit Woolie with heckfire btw
[4:40:53] <+pectusumbra> Okay, so reggie can 100% crush woolie
[4:40:59] <MyNameIsRasus> How much magic did that Prowler have
[4:41:01] <+Shishi1205> @pectusumbra Reflect tho
[4:41:03] <NoviceArtist4090> Halo ninja
[4:41:07] <+pectusumbra> ahhhh fuck, right
[4:41:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> HP for sure LUL
[4:41:11] <Solidnick18> killing woolie would be nice

[4:41:19] <%ekodrop> magic
[4:41:21] <+pectusumbra> but yeah SP
[4:41:21] <+Jiggisnipe> MORE MAGIC
[4:41:23] <MrATheGreat> Reggie's got only one option which makes him predictable
[4:41:24] <andre11dr> THAT DAMAGE
[4:41:24] <Solidnick18> okay
[4:41:28] <stoatacious> WOW
[4:41:29] <andre11dr> GET MAGIC
[4:41:33] <OldManDeckardCain> I mean, reggie can mixup woolie with having to choose between counter or reflect
[4:41:34] <+pectusumbra> he actually needs speed to use field magic
[4:41:38] <andre11dr> YOU DO SO MUCH DAMAGE
[4:41:43] <%saladin1911> bumping Speed at this point would be worthless ngl
[4:41:44] <dds333a> Kappa Kappa
[4:41:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> REGGIE NO
[4:41:56] <+Jiggisnipe> all magic
[4:42:00] <%saladin1911> especially since Woolie has over 20 speed
[4:42:08] <+Jiggisnipe> who has higher defense, Minh or Reggie?
[4:42:16] <+Jiggisnipe> counter
[4:42:19] <+Shishi1205> lmao
[4:42:21] <DigiDom> reggies ned to speedto hit nything
[4:42:23] <Timarkot> ...
[4:42:28] <+pectusumbra> yeah if woolie has reflect reggie has to have speed to threaten with strike

[4:42:29] <andre11dr> @jiggisnipe Reggie LUL
[4:42:40] <andre11dr> Minh has 9 DF
[4:42:47] <+pectusumbra> and it will help ALOT with field magic if that much gap can still have 49%
[4:42:48] <+Jiggisnipe> ok

[4:43:17] <+Shishi1205> 3 spin time
[4:43:23] <andre11dr> When he leveled up it's showed 9 DF
[4:43:30] <randominternetsurfer> Use Potion

[4:50:53] <sapphomet777> THERE WILL BE BLOOD....SHED
[4:50:58] <%krispen_wa> LADY MARIA, I'M A ROBIN
[4:51:07] <+pectusumbra> @Kaji04 Minh screwed up and played his and reggie's turns at random because tilt
[4:51:09] <dds333a> Minh secretly colluding with Woolie
[4:51:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MY GUIDING MOONLIGHT
[4:51:17] <Kaji04> ahhh that sucks
[4:51:18] <sapphomet777> THE MIHN IN THE MIRROR PLAYS AGAIN
[4:51:19] <dds333a> both situations were NOT accidents
[4:51:22] <+Vigonept> T I L T
[4:51:25] <andre11dr> @kaji04 But basically Minh went nuts and picked Reggies turns accidentally
[4:51:42] <andre11dr> And so he gave up
[4:51:42] <%livlinn> Btw bloodpool is still a thing right?
[4:51:57] <sapphomet777> yeah whats the bloodnews
[4:51:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Appropriate music
[4:52:06] <Qu1ckyyy> What is this OST?
[4:52:07] <+pectusumbra> I don't know why he didn't fight woolie again to recover from his mistake last fight
[4:52:09] <FrostedZaibatsu> Gherman's theme.
[4:52:13] <user_naim> The power of the first Dokage might have become too much to bear. It erodes Minh’s mind and body.
[4:52:20] <FrostedZaibatsu> from bloodborne
[4:52:21] <MrATheGreat> When a foul is made, the fouled gets to call whether or not the fouler gives up in a battle. It could be more advantageous for the fight to go on after all. Alternatively the fouler can be forced to select defend, which lets the attacker either strike or use magic
[4:52:30] <sapphomet777> its liie when raiden drank the God Juice
[4:52:30] <%krispen_wa> This is Maria's theme, not Gerhmans
[4:52:36] <dds333a> @user_naim too much power for a mortal body LUL
[4:52:43] <Kaji04> I'd say a coin toss between surrender and Death is the fairest
[4:52:50] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:52:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> my bad, they sound similar. and i never played the DLC
[4:52:58] <sapphomet777> alright you squid game MFs

[4:54:27] <+pectusumbra> is renew just better defend?
[4:54:29] <Solidnick18> give up
[4:54:40] <+Shishi1205> Renew is good to heal
[4:54:41] <+pectusumbra> reggie's got a revive though
[4:54:45] <+Vigonept> renew reggie
[4:54:46] <+Jiggisnipe> idk if an attack will kill
[4:54:47] <OldManDeckardCain> giving up is the play, didn't penny stay in that other place?
[4:54:48] <dds333a> @pectusumbra better tha. standard M guard at least
[4:54:48] <TheNeonCaster> @pectusumbra It has to be against a magic attack to fire
[4:54:50] <NoviceArtist4090> There’s really not much Reg can do
[4:54:55] <andre11dr> Renew ?
[4:54:59] <+pectusumbra> ah, gt ya

[4:55:13] <+Shishi1205> I think by % you counter
[4:55:14] <brunoberserk> oh boy im late , so hows going the journey ? whos winning ?
[4:55:14] <dds333a> Renew heals the opponent when they counter a magic attack
[4:55:14] <+Jiggisnipe> you might survive an attack
[4:55:15] <andre11dr> You have a lot of defense
[4:55:18] <+pectusumbra> This is a REAL fight though chat, don't get it tisted
[4:55:27] <+Grayhammatter> you might survive

[5:31:24] <+Jiggisnipe> Darkling is pretty ass
[5:31:32] <+pectusumbra> I bet vanish still dodges it though
[5:31:54] <dds333a> yep
[5:32:19] <+Jiggisnipe> it also assumes you can fight each other and this session showed that they can kill each other

[5:34:31] <+paladinstarbuster> weird that renew didnt heal
[5:34:38] <brunoberserk> so darkling is not worth it in this game ?
[5:34:57] <+pectusumbra> I want to say darkling is JUST a stat multiplier in this game
[5:35:02] <+Grayhammatter> it is if you are really behind, but not worth that much
[5:35:04] <dds333a> @brunoberserk so far, it's most significant contribution was destroying a weapon
[5:35:33] <dds333a> Also, Darkling XP is either nonexistent, or staggered
[5:35:37] <%saladin1911> @brunoberserk It makes the player Super strong. Like 200+ in some stats. So it's good for chasing and killing the other players
[5:35:37] <+pectusumbra> the closer in power level characters get the more darkling can blow people up
[5:35:57] <+Vigonept> it looks like darkling is staggered because ming leveled yo every fight after darkling

[5:43:31] <dds333a> @ballerswagbro9k this you? Kappa
[5:43:33] <+pectusumbra> Hey, Reggie working out those turns during your fight was EXACTLY what he needed to do
[5:43:33] <+paladinstarbuster> remember when this same thing happened before and them minh came back and won
[5:43:41] <InfiniteSwagbito> Reggie, your combat turn was like half an hour
[5:43:45] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie needed to work that turn
[5:43:45] <Shade075> LUL
[5:43:53] <+DACH33ZMAN> Dollar Tree Shikamaru
[5:43:56] <+Jiggisnipe> it was so important to think it out
[5:43:56] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:43:58] <%saladin1911> I unironically love the long turns with the open monologue LUL
[5:44:00] <Solidnick18> LUL
[5:44:06] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie is a wizard irl, he can cast sleep on his enemies LUL
[5:44:07] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:44:14] <glass_marcus> If it didn't work, it would be a problem. but he won, so it's hype
[5:44:19] <+Jiggisnipe> the long turn played Woolie tho, godlike reads
[5:44:21] <turboyabo> min has almost fell a sleep to woolie turn yes but thats for original dokkopon
[5:44:24] <MyNameIsRasus> the fight turns were long but it needed to be long, everything else though
[5:44:27] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[5:44:30] <andre11dr> Reggie was trying to play 50D chess but everyone was playing poker
[5:44:34] <dds333a> @mynameisrasus legit
[5:44:43] <user_naim> speed dokapon is heart attack territory
[5:44:59] <TreeLeafBoi> When reggie's thinking hit 5 minutes when promply to sleep
[5:44:59] <+pectusumbra> Those PvP battles are SO IMPORTANT
[5:45:00] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie was so right to think that out to avoid using magic and double striking
[5:45:01] <+samuraiknack> Reggie is a third rate duelist withe fourth rate deck
[5:45:17] <dds333a> SeemsGood
[5:45:18] <+terry_quest> does it matter how long they take?
[5:45:24] <+Jiggisnipe> and with that Penny is alone in some shop Kappa good session lol
[5:45:25] <MyNameIsRasus> PVP can take long, just don't take 5 minutes deciding between a green chest or an empty space
[5:45:25] <turboyabo> yea
[5:45:28] <dds333a> Great work everybody
[5:45:32] <Solidnick18> we battle again tomorrow

[5:47:02] <turboyabo> like for a episode where min was falling a sleep but then woked up , because started winning .
[5:47:08] <dds333a> I remember, Reg talking, at least to me
[5:47:09] <user_naim> nice
[5:47:20] <%thedankestmeeme> hope that cheers you up wools reggie can't steal those
[5:47:24] <+Jiggisnipe> in the pvp turn, Reggie talked the whole thing through
[5:47:26] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:47:31] <%ekodrop> down wit reggie
[5:47:32] <turboyabo> here min is losing baddly so his extra sleepy
[5:47:40] <%emperordread> #TeamReggie is always onboard
[5:47:45] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie the hero villain idiot protag
[5:47:51] <dds333a> LUL
[5:47:55] <turboyabo> yeah team reggie
[5:47:58] <plankk56> is minh the peoples champion? since they the dokage?
[5:47:58] <+Vigonept> AND HE STILL LOST
[5:47:59] <%ekodrop> BOOOOO
[5:47:59] <+terry_quest> LUL
[5:48:07] <Solidnick18> He was robbing and stealing
[5:48:18] <+Jiggisnipe> D:
[5:48:22] <andre11dr> There are mo champions this time around
[5:48:24] <+samuraiknack> Reggie is the protagonist, we are just the NPCs
[5:48:30] <glass_marcus> In coming sacrifice of team reggie to achieve ultimate power
[5:48:42] <dds333a> I'm not team anybody, but Team reggie is out here, I respect it
[5:48:43] <+terry_quest> he was talking
[5:49:06] <andre11dr> Reggie robbed 3 people today, so does he still get to be the champion LUL
[5:49:09] <user_naim> Dokapon Kingdom clearly scarred them all. Woolie became colder, more calculating. Reggie embraced crime and Minh turned to chaos.
[5:49:09] <KnivesEve> reggie is a anime tactician
[5:49:13] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie spoke out the pvp turn and he needed too
[5:49:15] <dds333a> well, yeah LUL
[5:50:03] <dds333a> LUL
[5:50:03] <+Jiggisnipe> GATHER
[5:50:07] <+samuraiknack> So when do we Salt Party Monopoly?
[5:50:12] <+Grayhammatter> gather!
[5:50:24] <glass_marcus> Reggie was probably MOST of the commentary this session
[5:50:27] <dds333a> oh boy LUL
[5:50:28] <Solidnick18> dat was good stuff
[5:50:43] <+pectusumbra> If this was a port of an older game he might not have been 'Mitch Digger' yet
[5:51:02] <+Vigonept> mitch THE digger is better?
[5:51:11] <+pectusumbra> @Jiggisnipe Agreed. That was anime level stuff
[5:51:46] <%smallboops> smallboops subscribed with Prime. 
[5:52:01] <Teras_ode> but you can't run DS games through steam, what would nintendosaurus say? Kappa
[5:52:09] <+Jiggisnipe> @pectusumbra so good and now Woolie know he can't just reflect cuz Reggie's strikes hurt
[5:52:11] <+samuraiknack> Mitch is the man, Mitch Digger is the fursona
[5:52:18] <Teras_ode> think of the dinos
[5:52:21] <Solidnick18> who
[5:52:22] <dds333a> LUL LUL

[5:52:43] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[5:52:52] <Solidnick18> yes
[5:52:52] <+pectusumbra> @Jiggisnipe that said Reggie DOES have to raise speed soon to be able to use field magic and keep up the strike threat
[5:52:59] <+Vigonept> fucking ardboard
[5:53:02] <bustahwuulf> It doesn't take much to convince me to play Fight Angel
