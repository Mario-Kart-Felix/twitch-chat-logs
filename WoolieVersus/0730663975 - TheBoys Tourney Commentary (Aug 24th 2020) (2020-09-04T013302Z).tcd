[0:04:51] <Justin_wongs_wang2> Dude you're a legend
[0:04:59] <@Solidus_113> I've maxed out my pc audio, and it usually sits at 30
[0:05:02] <SomersaultJustice> sonicfox needs to add more arms to his suit, cause he's basically goro
[0:05:08] <%AceOne5> Hi Woolie, Reggie and chat
[0:05:15] <simulationbard> Fight for the honor of getting your ass kicked by Sonicfox

[0:26:39] <AncelDeLambert> @prime_name I JUST rewatched that half an hour ago, it's Shitstorm 5 I think, but I don't remember the exact episode
[0:26:41] <%Malik1002> thanks @leaischill
[0:26:50] <%ChoculaUltra> where's Joker at on the tier list?
[0:26:52] <mellorolo> sub is solid
[0:26:58] <Franklin_Stine> @LeaIsChill I just got here was wondering what happening lol thanks
[0:27:02] <+CryptusMaximus> NRS are from Chicago, the IRL Zoning capital, so of course
[0:27:03] <%blaccbird914> @ChoculaUltra at the top
[0:27:05] <+LeaIsChill> dotodoMain @Malik1002
[0:27:08] <%ChoculaUltra> holy crap
[0:27:08] <andre11dr> He still got overheads ,at least he got that
[0:27:10] <+linSP> Sub zero IS cool
[0:27:10] <%BinaryFireball> scorpion keeps sending me pictures of him at the beach
[0:27:26] <%DensityD> that's good shit sanford
[0:27:29] <%ChoculaUltra> that's wild for a guest character
[0:27:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Terminator was good but he got hard nerfed i believe
[0:27:46] <fangovafang> wat about baraka?
[0:28:02] <%blaccbird914> Terminator is terrifying if he gets in your face
[0:28:14] <+LeaIsChill> Funny bois LUL
[0:28:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1295605483974295559
[0:28:16] <SomersaultJustice> is he leroy tier right now?
[0:28:17] <MurlinDurl> the yoker Kappa
[0:28:23] <+tacostarvedbeast> why dont woolie and reggie dress this fly?
[0:28:23] <andre11dr> How good is Fujin? I heard he's really good
[0:28:26] <+ElectricFoxLex> Don't forget Upgraded Jacqui
[0:28:28] <+CryptusMaximus> @BallerSwagBro9k Not really. They made his armor move breakable by giving everyone armor break moves, but he's pretty much the same other wise
[0:28:29] <+LeaIsChill> Oh that's the last schedule
[0:28:36] <Franklin_Stine> Haven't had internet access in about 6 months, is Ash still a possibility or did they cancel his appearance?
[0:28:38] <mellorolo> Noob is the Sub killer
[0:28:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cryptusmaximus Oh good then
[0:28:48] <RedHotBoss> oh, we not playin mk11? we watchin big updates?
[0:28:58] <+LeaIsChill> I bet Reggie would button up to the top button like the guy on the right tbh LUL
[0:29:05] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm always on the fence about guest characters being good/amazing. Especially if they're not a guaranteed return for the next game.
[0:29:23] <andre11dr> The Injustice curse
[0:29:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is Robocop the last dlc? Or are more coming?
[0:29:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Tekken 8 is going to be weird af without Akuma and Geese
[0:29:44] <%Malik1002> I feel it depends on what game for a guest character to be good or not i would say
[0:29:48] <%blaccbird914> Theres more coming
[0:29:52] <+LeaIsChill> @RedHotBoss We're watching a tournament. Just between rounds rn
[0:29:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cool
[0:29:57] <Terrarp> wait wut? I thought Woolie and Reggie would be the official commentators 😔
[0:29:58] <Ultra_Pancake> lol, I like their matching shirts
[0:30:35] <mellorolo> this IS the official commentary!
[0:30:55] <+cubbywolf> is this a single round knockout?
[0:30:56] <+CryptusMaximus> Terminator's my main, so Cetrion is the actual devil to me.
[0:30:59] <andre11dr> You're supposed to be Scorpion and teleport

[0:31:23] <zamzoph> Is Woolie practicing?
[0:31:23] <%SirGO0SE> Woolies AD game is on another level

[0:31:46] <MassConnect> why would you get people who aren't fanboys to do your commentary?
[0:31:47] <+LeaIsChill> "Now you too can shave your balls"
[0:31:52] <Terrarp> That's some money talk, smooth
[0:32:00] <raikagelord1> Just got a Boys ad LUL nice
[0:32:03] <+Titan_Six> Wooooooo
[0:32:17] <rufus2k2> Funny how the MC was originally based on Simon Pegg and they still got him to play someone else
[0:32:18] <%koolaid_kevster> woolieLORE
[0:32:21] <rufus2k2> jinx
[0:32:29] <raikagelord1> Got the first Volume and like the show better.
[0:32:33] <%ChoculaUltra> I made the mistake of going from The Boys to Crossed. Garth Ennis has some demons in him, but boy can he tell a story.
[0:32:40] <%koolaid_kevster> HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[0:32:40] <mellorolo> someone from theThe Boys looking like theyre going to appear as a guest character
[0:32:46] <rufus2k2> Ennis' Punisher MAX is godlike
[0:33:03] <rufus2k2> motherfucking Barracuda
[0:33:11] <%koolaid_kevster> spookyCody
[0:33:13] <+LeaIsChill> The Boys would be rad guest characters tbf
[0:33:23] <+CryptusMaximus> My adblock isn't working, what's going on with twitch?
[0:33:24] <%koolaid_kevster> ItsHappening
[0:33:26] <%ThisIsLloyd> ThisIsLloyd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[0:33:35] <%ChoculaUltra> Black Noir for MK11 S3
[0:33:43] <Terrarp> I read the Boys for a while and could not enjoy it, too edgy. Is the show better?
[0:33:47] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> WutFace
[0:34:03] <+LeaIsChill> @Terrarp It's easier to digest, I liked the show a ton more
[0:34:03] <@Solidus_113> @Terrarp it's still edgy
[0:34:09] <T_Sasquatch> Seriously there's no reason why that would ever happen , he has too much time to react (drugs tho)
[0:34:09] <bazz_tv> Oh are we talking about The Boys?
[0:34:11] <rufus2k2> show feels less like a commentary on the state of the comic industry
[0:34:16] <%ChoculaUltra> the show's definitely a lot more lax because of tv media needing to decently sanitized, but the edge and overall mood is still there
[0:34:24] <prime_name> Big Edge
[0:34:31] <raikagelord1> @terrarp 100% better in my opinion but I urge you to watch it and form your own opinion. It is still edgy but not too much.
[0:34:33] <Leafboi125> I liked the comics! I read them after seeing season 1
[0:34:39] <%ChoculaUltra> which is weird because its on Amazon Prime, I feel like they could get away with a lot more
[0:34:43] <%Solidnick18> oop
[0:34:51] <andre11dr> His take on the Punisher was the edgiest
[0:34:52] <%BisoromiBear> MIL
[0:34:54] <prime_name> Mom fight
[0:34:56] <scrublord009> wait what is this? Is woolie commentating?
[0:34:56] <juxtest> FLOAT FIGHT
[0:34:59] <Terrarp> is it as edgy tho? Comic felt like every story HAD to get either rape or child abuse
[0:35:01] <+cubbywolf> 80085
[0:35:02] <Franklin_Stine> The boys is the book where the sidekick has to shave his legs to look younger and has a bad relationship with the hero right? (Black and white book I think)
[0:35:03] <%Solidnick18> oh boy
[0:35:11] <bazz_tv> waifu fight
[0:35:14] <+LeaIsChill> Is that word really banned LUL ?
[0:35:23] <%Solidnick18> her zone is great
[0:35:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:35:33] <AncelDeLambert> this is gonna be a spitball fight, huh?
[0:35:33] <+CryptusMaximus> Woolie's channel banned the M word LUL
[0:35:33] <raikagelord1> I have never said this but the Boys comic is the only thing that is too edgy for me.
[0:35:35] <andre11dr> I think that was the one where he ties the dude to the tree and pulls his guts out LUL
[0:35:43] <%ChoculaUltra> @Franklin_Stine wrong series but what you're talking about sounds hella interesting
[0:35:45] <+CryptusMaximus> or Twitch did
[0:35:46] <scrublord009> wtf is the m word?
[0:35:49] <%Solidnick18> oooh
[0:35:50] <@Solidus_113> it's twitch in general, not this channel specifically
[0:35:56] <T_Sasquatch> Im confused. Is this a practice run of shout casting ?
[0:35:57] <Make_me_mad> New Sindel is way better than Old Sindel.
[0:35:57] <+LeaIsChill> That's so funny though
[0:36:08] <snakemuho> wait what why is an MK tourney suddenly has 50k viewers
[0:36:14] <@Solidus_113> allowed word permissions get reset every time the stream goes down
[0:36:19] <AncelDeLambert> "moobs"?
[0:36:20] <%Solidnick18> sure is
[0:36:28] <andre11dr> Mortal?
[0:36:29] <raikagelord1> @terrarp it is not as edgy. Has just enough edge to be different.
[0:36:29] <+LeaIsChill> Yep, moobs Kappa
[0:36:34] <+cubbywolf> what other fgc tournies are there, cpt?
[0:36:35] <andre11dr> That's not it
[0:36:40] <AncelDeLambert> psaSmug
[0:36:41] <%SirGO0SE> hehe moobies
[0:36:43] <BettyMwwaahh> okay i figured it out
[0:36:45] <+Taglog7> Nobodies Vs
[0:36:46] <Franklin_Stine> @ChoculaUltra Okay I think I'm thinking of something called "Rat Pack" or something like that. It kind of makes a relationship between heroes and sidekicks look like a terrible thing.
[0:36:55] <AncelDeLambert> ... don't want to clean out her shower drain
[0:36:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ouch
[0:37:01] <+Taglog7> WutFace core values
[0:37:09] <+cubbywolf> F
[0:37:10] <+LeaIsChill> Imagine approaching a Cetrion LUL

[0:37:12] <%Solidnick18> oh wow
[0:37:12] <andre11dr> Wake up buttons, the classic LUL

[0:37:21] <+UberWolfman> RIP
[0:37:23] <raikagelord1> @franklin_stine their is a Boys tie in with that storyline
[0:37:26] <%chll0ne> F
[0:37:44] <+cubbywolf> which way will the momentum break
[0:37:47] <+CryptusMaximus> Props for rocking goth SIndel though
[0:37:47] <+LeaIsChill> I'm rooting for Sindra tbh
[0:37:51] <bazz_tv> The Boys is not even that edgy compared to stuff like the Bratpack or Maximmortal
[0:37:52] <+LeaIsChill> SINDEL
[0:37:55] <+cubbywolf> blamo
[0:38:06] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:38:10] <+Taglog7> SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[0:38:10] <RedHotBoss> ggs damn
[0:38:10] <+LeaIsChill> Sindra is a very different "Champion" LUL
[0:38:16] <MurlinDurl> SwiftRage )))
[0:38:19] <andre11dr> I actually do like the supers this way more, you never saw them when it was all the meter
[0:38:20] <Franklin_Stine> @raikagelord1 Okay thank you. I hate it when I can't remember the name of something lol
[0:38:35] <Huntercd> Does Sindel have ass-less chaps?
[0:38:35] <RedHotBoss> dude, love the matching shirts lol
[0:38:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Boys isnt edgy its just shows a "realistic" view if heroes existed
[0:39:00] <+Taglog7> the top button is bothering me in this heat
[0:39:01] <%ChoculaUltra> if you guys like edge and gore, check out Crossed by Ennis. It's the Walking Dead but just more vile.
[0:39:02] <mellorolo> what are sindels go-to's?
[0:39:11] <RedHotBoss> reggie and woolz need matching hawaiian shirts or im out
[0:39:12] <bazz_tv> my only problem with the supers, is that they comeback if you whiff them

[0:39:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cetrion the Avatar
[0:40:00] <raikagelord1> @choculaultra I thought the Boys Comic was pretty Vile. I heard the “Wanted” comic got pretty vile as well.
[0:40:04] <andre11dr> Man ,i wish Shao Kan was actually good, he looks so cool
[0:40:08] <%Solidnick18> that was nice
[0:40:16] <Terrarp> never forget the Boys had an event called Herogasm
[0:40:17] <+Taglog7> yas
[0:40:32] <%chll0ne> @terrarp i read that lmao
[0:40:39] <%chll0ne> quite edgy indeed
[0:40:53] <%Solidnick18> oooh fancy
[0:41:06] <mellorolo> oh really!? good tip!
[0:41:09] <bazz_tv> Rick Veitch is the king of weird ass edgy comic books, have you guys read The One?
[0:41:12] <%ChoculaUltra> that was a sick fatal
[0:41:18] <compositefrylock> Cetrion: Mother of Avatars
[0:41:21] <+CryptusMaximus> wine mommy
[0:41:23] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:41:29] <raikagelord1> Nice Cetrion combo.
[0:41:30] <mellorolo> that's cool
[0:41:34] <+cubbywolf> grape juice
[0:41:38] <RedHotBoss> its welches grape juice
[0:41:39] <+cubbywolf> nono juice
[0:41:56] <%Double_Tap_That> Inexplicably bigger and bigger
[0:42:02] <zer0enixx> Neither is the boys
[0:42:09] <Terrarp> @chll0ne yep but also absurd. I get that Boys is not the edgier thing out there but it really went for weird dumb childish humor to fucked up edge things.
[0:42:15] <compositefrylock> Purple stuff or Jesus juice
[0:42:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's auntie Sindel's happy juice, don't drink it

[0:45:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> never mind
[0:45:21] <%ekodrop> are we supposed to be hearing game audio?
[0:45:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JADED
[0:45:52] <bazz_tv> not gonna lie not a fan of Night Wolf design, wish he was more like KI's Thunder
[0:45:56] <+LeaIsChill> @ekodrop In game audio also has the other commentators, they're speaking over it
[0:46:06] <+EdenOfLove> do they have to do friendships in the tournament
[0:46:07] <%Solidnick18> yay candy
[0:46:10] <+EdenOfLove> or are fatals allowed
[0:46:11] <%BisoromiBear> eating wrappers like a savage
[0:46:12] <RedHotBoss> all friendships all day
[0:46:14] <andre11dr> That was in MK9 to LUL
[0:46:16] <+armor_kuma> @bazz_tv I mean i think we all do cause thunder is a fuckin badass
[0:46:25] <andre11dr> When she was busted
[0:46:26] <+Taglog7> NomNom NomNom NomNom NomNom
[0:46:26] <+deviljhojho_> mortal kombaaaaaaaaaaat!
[0:46:34] <bazz_tv> Night Wolf just looks like combat John Redkorn to me
[0:46:43] <+CryptusMaximus> @EdenOfLove someone literally did a Brutality earlier, so it's just trollinh
[0:46:49] <Franklin_Stine> I noticed shedidn't take any of the wrappers off that candy lol
[0:47:10] <AncelDeLambert> get juggled, fool
[0:47:15] <+armor_kuma> Jade somehow looks really cool and simultaneously unfun to play lmao

[0:47:18] <AncelDeLambert> LOOK AT THE JUGGLE
[0:47:29] <andre11dr> I liked it more when it was a burst
[0:47:32] <TigerClaws12> bodied
[0:47:34] <JaseAdrift> near perfect
[0:47:36] <Terrarp> That piñata should've been of Kotal Kahn
[0:47:50] <%doomerskeletor13> God damn
[0:47:55] <bazz_tv> people liked the burst over the drop out
[0:48:00] <%Brutalyte616> "...I WOULD be willing to eat candy you sat on, if you weren't CRUSHING IT WITH YOUR ASS!"
[0:48:09] <%DarksideBluez> is this live?
[0:48:15] <AncelDeLambert> I think no
[0:48:16] <+armor_kuma> I was saying that literally yesterday, the breakaways are REALLY unsatisfying because you just kinda fall rather than burst
[0:48:23] <bazz_tv> drop out is risking more oki
[0:48:26] <AncelDeLambert> I believe they're watching either on delay or a vod
[0:48:30] <andre11dr> I still don't know how to feel about the two different meters,im kinda in to minds about it
[0:48:36] <mellorolo> noobs forward 3 def takes advantage of that breakaway drop
[0:48:37] <%DarksideBluez> but they are live right?
[0:48:54] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie is, yes
[0:48:55] <RedHotBoss> this screen is so green right now

[0:50:47] <+antthefool> JEEZE @mellorolo

[0:51:23] <bazz_tv> but Blanche can live if you use her as a brutality
[0:51:24] <%SirGO0SE> you wanna be "leave me be" reptile
[0:51:31] <dinnydanny777> Just make sure you're not too into the story, or you might be a character motivation
[0:51:37] <Franklin_Stine> At least Blanch gets to kick the crap out of somebody depending if you press the right button lol
[0:51:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Shiva Kreygasm

[1:45:34] <andre11dr> I don't even remember Sareena
[1:45:40] <+awesomeguy423> you not a true OG then
[1:45:44] <Father_Freedom> sareena is the chick with the face paint and colored hair
[1:45:49] <Father_Freedom> she was playable in armageddon
[1:45:49] <+awesomeguy423> these boys dont remember Mythologies smh
[1:45:55] <andre11dr> Was that the Mythologys girl
[1:45:57] <Father_Freedom> yea that too
[1:46:15] <+awesomeguy423> MK story isn't worth a damn without Tobias
[1:46:17] <Father_Freedom> the balls to grab there
[1:46:22] <raikagelord1> Does MK have a boxer or Muay Thai character?
[1:46:22] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:46:23] <%SilverRoddo> “We’re the nobodies, wanna be some bodies” SingsNote
[1:46:28] <Father_Freedom> yeah the story is shit but the games sick
[1:46:51] <%chidory000> Jax and jaqui
[1:46:51] <andre11dr> For a fighting game it's fine
[1:46:54] <+Ne0nF0xx> @raikagelord1 Jaqui is kind of a boxer. or Jax
[1:46:55] <+awesomeguy423> i still regard this game to be a big step down gameplay wise from X
[1:46:55] <%Malik1002> nah I like the stories cause there goofy
[1:47:05] <+awesomeguy423> I really dig MK9 story
[1:47:06] <+awesomeguy423> X is okay
[1:47:09] <+awesomeguy423> 11 is bad
[1:47:10] <Make_me_mad> MK X and 11 had not great stories, but Aftermath kinda brought it back to being good.
[1:47:11] <%nicversus> Damn, Tasty Steve does look pretty tasty
[1:47:18] <Make_me_mad> 9 had a fantastic story though.
[1:47:19] <Father_Freedom> right its a good launcher in variations where he doesnt have the uppercut
[1:47:21] <raikagelord1> Y’all right. Jaqui is definitely that.
[1:47:25] <%chll0ne> mk 11 storymode is okay
[1:47:32] <+awesomeguy423> I resent 9 for making cinematic storymodes the norm
[1:47:37] <+awesomeguy423> they're a huge waste of budget
[1:47:47] <%SnackinOnChimps> SnackinOnChimps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[1:47:54] <Father_Freedom> yeah i miss conquest mode
[1:47:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:58] <Afterman_> Thanks for the HyperMine @snackinonchimps
[1:47:58] <%chll0ne> >tfw after watch 4thsnake vids KappaRoss
[1:48:01] <TheFramedWarlock> What is this stream ?
[1:48:01] <raikagelord1> I think the MK11 story is pretty good in my opinion but that is just me.
[1:48:07] <Make_me_mad> "Waste" is pretty subjective since it's the only reason I buy these games.
[1:48:08] <+awesomeguy423> 4thsnake is a chad
[1:48:18] <+awesomeguy423> @Make_me_mad DansGame
[1:48:22] <andre11dr> Fighting games have a real problem with telling stories without just going "there's big tournament, have big fight"
[1:48:23] <+awesomeguy423> oh wait
[1:48:27] <+awesomeguy423> fighting games in general
[1:48:29] <+awesomeguy423> or just NRS games
[1:48:34] <MichaelOfCainhurst> 4thsnake LUL
[1:48:34] <%Solidnick18> the chop
[1:48:44] <%chll0ne> fighting game stories arent good NotLikeThis
[1:48:45] <Make_me_mad> I honestly don't care about MK competitively even a little. I just like the story because I played it when I was a kid and thought it was cool.
[1:48:49] <%chll0ne> fun to watch tho
[1:48:53] <+awesomeguy423> okay if you just mean MK you're alright
[1:48:57] <+awesomeguy423> for a sec I thought you meant all fighting games
[1:48:58] <KaiserMario> Fujin?
[1:49:05] <Father_Freedom> Fujin players?
[1:49:07] <Father_Freedom> check the bracket
[1:49:15] <raikagelord1> I think the story and gameplay can both be good and cool.
[1:49:24] <+awesomeguy423> the money that goes into fighting game cinematic stories could go into multiple new characters
[1:49:28] <Father_Freedom> damn dont see hayatei
[1:49:32] <+awesomeguy423> now NRS games are bleh so it doesn't matter
[1:49:40] <%chll0ne> mk does it best but thats not saying much
[1:49:45] <+awesomeguy423> but like MvCI could've had an additional 4-5 chars with the money that went into story budget
[1:49:58] <TheFramedWarlock> Idk some people are really into the lore of some games
[1:49:59] <raikagelord1> @awesomeguy423 maybe if I would like a decent story or at least Arcade.
[1:50:03] <Make_me_mad> I guess my stance is that if I don't care about the new characters then why bother having them included.
[1:50:04] <TheFramedWarlock> Like Guilty Gear
[1:50:04] <+awesomeguy423> arcade is fine
[1:50:11] <%chll0ne> ye
[1:50:11] <+awesomeguy423> arcade isn't a hueg time and money sink @raikagelord1
[1:50:14] <Make_me_mad> With something like MvC it's different because those characters are established.
[1:50:15] <%Solidnick18> ooooo
[1:50:16] <Father_Freedom> WHY WOULD U LET GO OF BLOCK atpRtsd
[1:50:17] <velvetroomalex> there were way more problems than a story mode for MVCI lol
[1:50:21] <Make_me_mad> So just more characters is good.
[1:50:21] <GarbageNirvana> Oof
[1:50:22] <%Solidnick18> ah ya hate to see it
[1:50:23] <%chll0ne> but just watch the pcp lecture for GH
[1:50:27] <%chll0ne> *GG
[1:50:30] <velvetroomalex> it's not fair to blame it all on story
[1:50:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Oof
[1:50:32] <Make_me_mad> Also because MvC I had a garbage tier story.
[1:50:40] <+awesomeguy423> thing is big cinematic stories are a huge portion of budget and dev time
[1:50:43] <+awesomeguy423> meaning
[1:50:43] <TheFramedWarlock> Yo another PCP fan in the chat PogChamp
[1:50:46] <+awesomeguy423> games that don't have them
[1:50:49] <+awesomeguy423> have more time to make characters
[1:50:49] <%Solidnick18> um
[1:50:53] <velvetroomalex> sure dude
[1:51:01] <Make_me_mad> You don't even need a big cinematic story. Go the P4A route and put in a visual novel and I'm good.
[1:51:02] <+awesomeguy423> lmao you really gonna tell me im wrong
[1:51:03] <+wolfofsound> what a take LUL
[1:51:08] <Make_me_mad> Or even just cheesy arcade mode endings.
[1:51:10] <+awesomeguy423> @Make_me_mad im same on this
[1:51:17] <%chll0ne> their lectures are great
[1:51:19] <+awesomeguy423> but like MK story mode is expensive
[1:51:24] <KaiserMario> He's a bit underwhelming compared to Goro though...
[1:51:34] <AncelDeLambert> ...
[1:51:35] <MichaelOfCainhurst> @awesomeguy423 should have*
[1:51:36] <ZeeJiggle> Yeeeeeah
[1:51:36] <AncelDeLambert> what new hell
[1:51:37] <+BubbaRands> The Boys PogChamp
[1:51:37] <raikagelord1> Then I would be cool with that if the arcade had good individual stories that may or may not tie in to an overarching story. @awesomeguy423
[1:51:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Da Boyz
[1:51:44] <TheFramedWarlock> GG and Animorphs are the best lectures
[1:51:47] <Make_me_mad> The MK story mode is way more elaborate than it needs to be. I'm okay with the way Mk9 did it because it blew through three whole games worth of plot.
[1:51:48] <+awesomeguy423> @raikagelord1 ever played street fighter alpha 3
[1:51:50] <nintega010> I just watched this trailer
[1:51:50] <%chll0ne> just the boys?
[1:51:54] <Leafboi125> Da bears
[1:51:56] <MichaelOfCainhurst> because we've seen that it's not like that
[1:51:58] <%chll0ne> wb the girls?
[1:51:59] <GarbageNirvana> I hear this show's good
[1:52:04] <raikagelord1> @awesomeguy423 a little and I thought t was great.
[1:52:09] <+awesomeguy423> aight
[1:52:09] <+wolfofsound> @GarbageNirvana it's pretty good, don't read the comic
[1:52:10] <Father_Freedom> yeah but by the time you're at MK11 some characters have lost every fight theyve ever had
[1:52:10] <+awesomeguy423> yeah
[1:52:14] <ZeeJiggle> I do!? O:
[1:52:15] <+awesomeguy423> SFA3 and SF4 do that really well
[1:52:17] <+j0hnnydonuts> nah :)
[1:52:17] <Father_Freedom> like your villains seem so lame when they cant do anything
[1:52:19] <+awesomeguy423> arcade modes have bits of stories
[1:52:19] <%heartlesshealer> the series is actually just called "The Boys"
[1:52:24] <ZeeJiggle> I'm learning so much
[1:52:26] <%nicversus> oh THAT The Boys
[1:52:34] <+CounterBeard> How close does it follow the comics? Cause the comics have some fucking OOF in them
[1:52:39] <therealtacopancakes> have you read the comics?
[1:52:40] <+awesomeguy423> @CounterBeard not at all
[1:52:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Huh cool
[1:52:47] <GarbageNirvana> @wolfofsound Unfortunate writing there?
[1:52:48] <%nicversus> I thought we were just hanging out with the boys
[1:52:48] <+awesomeguy423> for one Homelander actually raped Billy's wife
[1:52:49] <%SirGO0SE> yo 2.3k in here right now? lets go
[1:52:51] <+awesomeguy423> instead of being framed
[1:52:55] <%heartlesshealer> The movie is gonna be super watered down for anyone who's read the comics
[1:52:55] <+awesomeguy423> which was really weird
[1:52:58] <+Memitim> @CounterBeard same general concept, but not at all as edgy
[1:52:59] <+wolfofsound> @GarbageNirvana yeah it's pretty bad even for when it came out
[1:53:02] <TheFramedWarlock> Skullgirls BibleThump
[1:53:03] <%heartlesshealer> because movies
[1:53:06] <+awesomeguy423> also Billy's wife isn't dead
[1:53:07] <GarbageNirvana> Mm
[1:53:12] <%nicversus> RIP Skullgirls
[1:53:15] <+awesomeguy423> wonder if they'll do the thing
[1:53:15] <raikagelord1> And while I may be tired of “Evil Superman”(literally) love the concept.
[1:53:22] <+awesomeguy423> where Black Noire is a clone of Homelander

[1:53:28] <%doomerskeletor13> brownW
[1:53:29] <+awesomeguy423> made specifically to kill homelander if he goes rogue
[1:53:36] <+awesomeguy423> that was weird fam
[1:53:40] <andre11dr> I view fighting game story like Platinum games story's, or like one Carmack would say "It's like story in porn, it's cool when it's there, but you don't need it"
[1:53:41] <%chll0ne> ye
[1:53:46] <+wolfofsound> How about not spoiling what could be in the show guy
[1:53:47] <CrimsonFox777> Was an amazing twist though.

[1:54:37] <+awesomeguy423> no, you choked on a meatball @BubbaRands
[1:54:44] <%doomerskeletor13> I’ll be real I think the show is better than the comic, so far at least
[1:54:53] <%heartlesshealer> if it's a series and not a movie then they might some of the cruel stuff in, but still watered down impact on some stuff
[1:54:57] <%chll0ne> yeah the comic is mad edge n kinda tasteless imo

[2:30:04] <Franklin_Stine> It would be awesome if NRS could make a "Primal Rage" game. Maybe add King Kong and Godzilla for cross promotion. Add the "Rampage" trio from their Midway Library, plenty of new monsters.
[2:30:53] <+Memitim> @WoolieVersus He also did a D2 because he read the breakaway, which is the max single button damage you can get

[2:38:08] <+Kriptin> The Kung Lao who didn't protect his neck from Shao Khan.
[2:38:46] <%AceOne5> The Great Kung Lao who tried so hard and got so far...
[2:38:48] <CazadorDeWulf> KL got that anti plot armor on

[2:41:11] <CazadorDeWulf> Erron isnt cool he's just edgy
[2:41:24] <+TopTieramisu> edgy? he's downright looney tunes in 11
[2:41:37] <MichaelOfCainhurst> He's not edgy
[2:41:46] <Hammatime8> @cazadordewulf Yeah, but he's edgy in a cool way!
[2:41:50] <CazadorDeWulf> VrigilxCowboy
[2:42:03] <+Memitim> He was edgy in X, now he's just like "western cowboy"
[2:42:06] <+linSP> did orange monitor mode activate
[2:42:12] <+TheChapyGuy> MK just has baseline 90's edge. there's a 'K' instead of a 'C' in the name lol

[2:42:46] <%AceOne5> Erron Black: Professional Edgelord
[2:43:05] <+Memitim> The winner should be able to watch the season 2 premiere early

[2:43:59] <+TheChapyGuy> that was nice
[2:44:00] <+TopTieramisu> noob tries to be edge, but he just became dr claw
[2:44:09] <+mrboo001> I made the mistake of watching some Canadian PSA commercials... MK is now not nearly as violent.
[2:44:19] <+Memitim> it comes back as long as it doesn't hit
[2:44:37] <Hammatime8> I have now I idea what's going on, but woolieYE
[2:44:44] <andre11dr> I mean, let's not forget the PS2 era where edge was at a minimal 1000000
[2:44:50] <dinnydanny777> Wasn't there an Australian TV advert about not drink driving which had someone drive through a child's picnic
[2:44:54] <+TheChapyGuy> that's why Johnny and Joker being able to dash cancel out of theirs is so good
[2:45:45] <CazadorDeWulf> tall just think edge is cool and try to defend your emo haircut of 10 years ago
