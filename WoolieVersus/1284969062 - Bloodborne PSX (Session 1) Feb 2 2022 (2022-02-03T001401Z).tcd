[0:00:00] <+TungstenoViperante> @crybirb did you play the og?
[0:00:00] <%robosqueeb> woo lay
[0:00:00] <CommanderTilio> Rise, trashman!
[0:00:00] <leith_aziz> @dai_tonight Critical perception I guess? That's still kinda weird to claim a failure when it makes money
[0:00:07] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb yes
[0:00:08] <cartakus> Hello
[0:00:09] <+Captain_Spicy_> The bois PogChamp
[0:00:10] <%crybirb> @TungstenoViperante, yes I did, on PS3, I still have my copy
[0:00:10] <Solidnick18> Hello
[0:00:10] <%mr_sups> Welcome to Yarnahm
[0:00:12] <mudox1717> yo!
[0:00:13] <DextralMalin> Howdy
[0:00:13] <%elderpunch> @Eustacecervidae PrideCrown
[0:00:16] <+MustComplete> Sushi and a Woolie stream! Nothing better to make my day!
[0:00:17] <+nightmare6997> yooo
[0:00:18] <%mr_sups> Or however you spell that
[0:00:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> Great!
[0:00:21] <+Cecrios> bluhblorne
[0:00:22] <+Mr_Pylon> Woolie got his humanity back, no longer hollowed out.
[0:00:23] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:00:25] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:00:27] <+Axellogic> Who are you!? where am I!?
[0:00:27] <%LastHazzerd> heat of the moment
[0:00:28] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, my gripe is that no words about a good Mega Man back and no DLC for 11, and it was a really short, goot but really short game.
[0:00:31] <RyuuAoi> Y'all tired? Ha
[0:00:32] <%livlinn> shiaHypers woolieYE shiaHypers
[0:00:33] <Puhff> im good, how r u?
[0:00:33] <DSD24> Always be going back in
[0:00:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie was heated, I know the feeling
[0:00:34] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> LanceCorpralScottBukake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 2 month streak! What would be the ideal setting for the next Bloodborne game if one was made?
[0:00:37] <+DACH33ZMAN> has Reggie every played/seen BB before?
[0:00:38] <%jinking79> he recovered
[0:00:39] <leith_aziz> Hi
[0:00:42] <%CisealNine> It's weird that this will be Reggie's first experience with Bloodborne.
[0:00:43] <%mr_sups> I popped into Everhood yesterday and saw some SHIT
[0:00:43] <Arqartur0> woolieYE
[0:00:45] <Xaeveax> So wait, Reggie is gonna see the demake before the real deal?
[0:00:45] <dai_tonight> @leith_aziz Yeah it was that. It's another Fallout New Vegas situation. Ugh.
[0:00:47] <+3d_pbandj> Never stop going back in
[0:00:49] <%crybirb> @DACH33ZMAN, Nope, it's his first time.
[0:00:49] <Awesome_Leaf> is reggie on the sticks?
[0:00:49] <BlackermanZX> that frog gonna get it soon
[0:00:52] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's fair
[0:00:58] <+DACH33ZMAN> @crybirb what a weird way to introduce it lol
[0:00:59] <dai_tonight> reggie I love you
[0:01:03] <%LastHazzerd> Labbing
[0:01:07] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:01:13] <%hax_metatron> I can't wait for Woolie to find out how NOT SMALL this Demake is LUL... there's so much content.
[0:01:17] <andre11dr> Woolie really thinks he gonna finish this in one ,he forgot about Snailborne
[0:01:17] <dai_tonight> laugh through the pain
[0:01:19] <Arqartur0> Yesterday's stream was FUCKING AWESOME
[0:01:22] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb absolutely, I really enjoyed "most" megaman games, and it just gets less and less used as an ip. the fan game really brought the interest back
[0:01:23] <leith_aziz> Training mode is love
[0:01:26] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm gonna lab me some lunch, that's hwat
[0:01:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> Frog Download underway
[0:01:31] <%crybirb> @DACH33ZMAN, Woolie commented about it, but he wants Reggie to do the full canonical lap, with DS2 -> BB -> DS3 -> Sekiro
[0:01:40] <leith_aziz> Half of my playtime in Rev 2 was in training. It was fun pickyFocus
[0:01:48] <%dds333a> @slipdog it looks like garbage LUL
[0:01:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Labbing is just grinding XP
[0:01:52] <%Theycallmenerf> Is Labbing, Sunday school for fighting games?
[0:01:53] <leith_aziz> Just doing cool combos with music blasting off
[0:01:54] <+DACH33ZMAN> @crybirb I missed this comment. TY.
[0:02:01] <dai_tonight> @crybirb woolie is a hackfraud then cuz reggie's should've played ps3 demons souls
[0:02:06] <dabeaminator> No way in hell you're finishing this today unless you go long or sprint through it.
[0:02:09] <mudox1717> if you don't lab, you won't get no play.
[0:02:12] <slipdog> what did i even say
[0:02:12] <%LastHazzerd> it's hard to see everything when you gotta pay attention to what is immediately in front of you.
[0:02:13] <%dds333a> Woolie's admittedly low abilities Kappa
[0:02:18] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, Like, I played the Zero collection and god I miss them so much, Shovel Knight is really here to substitute it but there's just something about Mega Man that its missing. Also Legends 3 was supposed to be so good.
[0:02:24] <RyuuAoi> Woolie met his match?
[0:02:48] <dai_tonight> speaking of mega man I really hope sony doesn't buy capcom omg
[0:02:56] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @TungstenoViperante
[0:02:59] <leith_aziz> @crybirb Zero 4 wrapped things off nicely. I think its better off left as is. pickyEZ
[0:02:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[0:03:06] <%crybirb> @dai_tonight, the topic started because I said I wish that happened lol
[0:03:10] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah we're Undertale lolnope gotcha
[0:03:15] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb i am still salty over legends 3, i would love more zero games if nothing else, fills my speedy action platformer niche well
[0:03:33] <dai_tonight> @crybirb I feel like sony buying capcom would simply bury franchises like mega man even more.
[0:03:34] <%Exiliator> Exiliator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! 
[0:03:35] <%crybirb> @leith_aziz, it diiiid, but, just something liek that you know? I loved Zero 1 because it felt so bleak and different and it played SO GOOD
[0:03:35] <dai_tonight> Forever rip.
[0:03:44] <Treasure_Vault> Apparently the Gasters are a reference to Yume Nikki, not Undertale?
[0:03:45] <%lord_woodsy> lord_woodsy subscribed with Prime. 
[0:03:49] <Mr_Rakjo> Werent we doing Everhood again?
[0:03:51] <dai_tonight> I would unironically prefer microsoft to buy them. If they could, which they can't.
[0:03:56] <andre11dr> The Undertale iceberg is I N F I N I T E
[0:03:58] <Grim1952> Yeah, that's why Delta Rune doesn't appeal to me, i had enough with undertale
[0:03:59] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, I promised i would buy a 3DS when it launched, I skipped 3ds because I was and still am salty about it.
[0:04:00] <%LastHazzerd> they done a little trolling
[0:04:04] <BlackermanZX> Gunvolt series filled my caving for a fast platformer
[0:04:10] <%dds333a> @treasure_vault Gaster is already a partial reference to Uboa
[0:04:12] <%lord_woodsy> glad to finally be part of the crew
[0:04:14] <%X2Eliah> never happened
[0:04:18] <%X2Eliah> not once
[0:04:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Fume Knight
[0:04:19] <CyrusVGZ> Tell Woolie to buy Capcom. Kappa
[0:04:21] <%crybirb> @dai_tonight, yeah I know this is priobably what would happen, I just have blind faith that something like this big happening would change the situation
[0:04:24] <RyuuAoi> YET
[0:04:28] <%Lion_kun> I think the longest was Midir
[0:04:29] <RyuuAoi> It's comin
[0:04:36] <%X2Eliah> So Reggie, Dark Souls 2 Awaits
[0:04:37] <%Lion_kun> Pat versus Midir
[0:04:39] <leith_aziz> @BlackermanZX Isnt the actor for the MC of Gunvolt the same as Ky Kiske/Trunks?
[0:04:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Fume Knight was THE wall for Woolie back in the day
[0:04:48] <%dds333a> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:04:52] <andre11dr> Fume Knight took him a lot didn't it
[0:04:53] <Lunalios> it's between midir and Kos, for me
[0:04:58] <kes009900> what about OG dokapon weeks?
[0:04:58] <+Jiggisnipe> Fume Knight
[0:05:01] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:05:03] <+DACH33ZMAN> Nameless King was my wall big time
[0:05:04] <leith_aziz> Im considering buying Hollow Knight during this Steam Sale
[0:05:05] <slipdog> NK forever and always
[0:05:06] <@Solidus_113> rent free
[0:05:09] <dai_tonight> @crybirb I think Capcom is doing good, minor NFTs aside. No need to make them exclusive to one company. Activision and Bethesda both needed reestructuring. Bungie...was a weird purchase.
[0:05:09] <Treasure_Vault> @dds333a You ain't wrong. I couldn't tell the difference.
[0:05:10] <velgaduere> R A I M E
[0:05:11] <leith_aziz> It seems pretty beloved
[0:05:13] <dai_tonight> Especially for that much money.
[0:05:13] <andre11dr> Orphan to me was the one
[0:05:14] <Lunalios> Woolie's was fume knight, yeah
[0:05:16] <%elderpunch> @X2Eliah cant wait to see the frozen tundra section
[0:05:18] <%crybirb> Kos took a long time for me, but I played against him so much it's almost muscle memory at this point
[0:05:18] <%robosqueeb> demon of hatred...
[0:05:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @andre11dr I think in that episode he mentioned it was a 40 minute long session of attempts in pure silence.
[0:05:29] <$guiltyboya> Finally playing Bloodborne... oh, wait a second bawkRly
[0:05:37] <BlackermanZX> @leith_aziz i think the jp va is different
[0:05:40] <+robertoszek> just tuned in, what are we talking about?
[0:05:41] <%dds333a> @robosqueeb enough
[0:05:42] <andre11dr> Orphan took me like 2 days
[0:05:43] <DXLelouch24> Is Woolie aware of the extra content in the demake? Mod girl went above and beyond.
[0:05:45] <slipdog> @leith_aziz i belove it, good hard metroidvania with that feelsy lore and slapping ost
[0:05:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @guiltyboya bloodborne on PC babyyyy
[0:05:47] <+DACH33ZMAN> I felt a ray of hope with Kos. I never got morally defeated. NK morally defeated me on many fronts
[0:05:50] <%crybirb> @dai_tonight, right? Bungie felt so weird. I dunno I feel like Capcom home will always be Nintendo for some reason.
[0:05:54] <%X2Eliah> @robertoszek bosses that are walls
[0:06:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Bloodborne on PC? More like bloodboner Kreygasm
[0:06:06] <%Hapsam> oh noe, reggie gonna get bloodborne spoiled back in 1995
[0:06:08] <%lord_woodsy> only recently rewatched the ds2 compilation and I loved the fume knight battle!!
[0:06:10] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb if you wanted something else that's similar but different, go emulate/play shinobi 3 for sega genesis. I've been fuming for years that never got continued for a real long time. Game is sick, and has fantastic soundtrack.
[0:06:15] <CappuccinoGuil> I regret writing that
[0:06:15] <$guiltyboya> @CappuccinoGuil yeaaaaaaaaah - at least the closest thing to it that can be
[0:06:27] <%dds333a> Flamelurker is a straight bitch
[0:06:28] <+DACH33ZMAN> The real end boss in BB is the bloody crow
[0:06:36] <+Prism_Zet> man i hate that the reply doesn't go the the comment i clicked reply on LOL
[0:06:36] <leith_aziz> Im trying to remember a boss I faced when I was young that I was stuck on
[0:06:37] <%WutangchickeN> BB psx let's goooooo
[0:06:38] <dai_tonight> @crybirb Same, Konami as well. You can make an argument for either Nintendo or Sony but I feel like current Nintendo fits current Capcom better. Any japanese developer, really.
[0:06:39] <RyuuAoi> Chat gonna spoil tf outta Bloodborne for Reggie today.
[0:06:41] <+robertoszek> @robertoszek did they hit a wall recently? or just talking about past occurrences
[0:06:41] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, I'll try it, I played that only when I was a kid. I was a SNES boi in the neighborhood if you know what I mean
[0:06:45] <%Theycallmenerf> My hardest time with a Soulsborne boss, was probably Orphan of Kos, Reggie don’t look that up.
[0:06:49] <CommandantKobold> Shield = Dropped
[0:06:50] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Hi chat :) vineChatspin
[0:06:50] <leith_aziz> Im being reminded of Venom's final boss in Ultimate Spiderman
[0:06:50] <%X2Eliah> @robertoszek yesterday
[0:07:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CappuccinoGuil
[0:07:00] <%jinking79> best Great Sword he had too
[0:07:03] <dai_tonight> Sony is scared of japanese booba for some reason. But only the japanese one.
[0:07:04] <%ChillaxingJay> !uptime
[0:07:04] <@Moobot> @ChillaxingJay WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 26 minutes and 16 seconds
[0:07:05] <leith_aziz> I always needed my day to mash open the doors. Sorry dad pickyAYAYA
[0:07:08] <BlackermanZX> I always try to speedrun 100% on mega man games
[0:07:08] <%Lion_kun> Pat has to wait in silence as Woolie bashed his head on him
[0:07:09] <%MTLer> MTLer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Hi Woolie! Go eat some questionable chicken Reggie!
[0:07:10] <%X2Eliah> Score doesnt count
[0:07:14] <%elderpunch> @Theycallmenerf for me it was laurence
[0:07:16] <Saltmeisterr> i love score attack
[0:07:18] <%X2Eliah> like cheevos
[0:07:21] <velgaduere> score is boring
[0:07:22] <Saltmeisterr> number go up
[0:07:23] <%dds333a> I have "Pause, Reload" burned into my memory due to time attack LUL
[0:07:23] <andre11dr> Look i won't lie the first time i fought Fume Knight i hit him with Climax and it did more than half his life ,so that's why probably i don't have the same attachment to him LUL
[0:07:31] <%crybirb> @dai_tonight, Sony it just feels like, too full of themselves while Capcom still try to push the childhood wonder in some franchises, with humor and fun universe. That doesn't fit Sony anymore, they only have "serious" projects. Nintendo would fit better for sure. Now, Konami, be my guess I have no idea what would be good for them lol
[0:07:34] <$guiltyboya> @Theycallmenerf I did Orphan okay, honestly... but Horse face. Damn you, horse face
[0:07:36] <leith_aziz> You mean highscores? Yeah, they dont mean much to me
[0:07:39] <%X2Eliah> Just like time trial in racing games
[0:07:42] <Lunalios> score?
[0:07:45] <Grim1952> Dog in chalice was pain
[0:07:46] <%X2Eliah> some ppl love it, some feel its boring
[0:07:54] <velgaduere> time > score
[0:08:05] <Saltmeisterr> i treat score kinda like ranking
[0:08:05] <BlackermanZX> i like time attacks when it gives you stuff like in Shadow of the Colossus
[0:08:06] <Lunalios> time is always more interesting than scores
[0:08:09] <%dds333a> I have fond memories of all A-Rank in SA2
[0:08:11] <Lunalios> to me
[0:08:12] <+robertoszek> @robertoszek oh, in everhood? I wanna play it myself so I've been avoiding those streams
[0:08:13] <dai_tonight> @crybirb I think Konami would be better off pulling a FOX and splitting, selling their videogame division. The pachinko shit and stay away for all I care.
[0:08:17] <%mr_sups> Unless it's an Arcade game like Pac-Man and the like
[0:08:18] <%X2Eliah> That said, DMC is nonstop score attack
[0:08:20] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb yeah haha, genesis here, had to play megaman x on my neighbors snes. Shinobi 3 is about the equivalent for speed and stuff, dash run, triangle jumps, ceiling hangs, dive kicks, mele, projectile blocking, double jumps, fantastic style, fight literal mecha-godzilla
[0:08:21] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah Those are fun to master on your own if you already enjoy the game. It doesnt really need its own mode, allthough it is encouraging
[0:08:21] <Saltmeisterr> though it depends on the game for me
[0:08:22] <RyuuAoi> High score was arcade and they dead now.
[0:08:24] <%jinking79> that tournament of be hell n a cell match in the fastest time but guy said u cheated cause he wasn't looking LUL
[0:08:25] <Carlioo> it's also easier to grasp I think
[0:08:28] <velgaduere> yeahhh babyyyyyy
[0:08:29] <%Theycallmenerf> @elderpunch I was running the Ludwig Holy Blade, completely missed the giant hammer saw weapon, grabbed the best version from Chalice Dungeons, farmed gems and within 3 try’s I got Laurence down. But yeah he wasn’t a push over.
[0:08:33] <dabeaminator> Trying to S rank missions in DMC is the only score based challenge I've really enjoyed
[0:08:34] <%Bluwizard21> DS1 and Bloodborne all bosses is sub 1 hour. DS2 is about to be sub 2 hours all bosses
[0:08:37] <%dds333a> how about Osman Kappa
[0:08:39] <+DACH33ZMAN> high scores only really mattered in arcades IMO
[0:08:44] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, that sounds interesting I will try for sure! Thanks for the recommend.
[0:08:46] <leith_aziz> I find rankings fine. DMC is like the prime example
[0:08:51] <i47h26qv2ec7chjj> also, it's about completion time too, and get faster as you get better, while scoring runs get longer as you get better
[0:08:56] <%crybirb> @dai_tonight, yeah I agree with you there, maybe that would be the most positive outcome
[0:09:03] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb they have a history of unofficial cameo's, batman, spiderman, the terminator, mecha-godzilla all show up as bosses LOL
[0:09:13] <iacus_> Wow
[0:09:14] <%Theycallmenerf> @guiltyboya I had heard of horse face, so I called in one friend and within 12 try’s I got him.
[0:09:17] <dai_tonight> Arcade modes are fun. I love time attacks.
[0:09:20] <%RyTYoung> Damn
[0:09:21] <Saltmeisterr> chat would you say wave based endless hoard modes as score attack?
[0:09:23] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, wait wth? It's that kind of japanese game? Now you got my attention lol
[0:09:29] <+Tucker0603> ikaruga is the best
[0:09:30] <iacus_> I've never been able to chain beyond Chapter 1 in Ikaruga
[0:09:30] <mothdude> How about getting SSS combos in DMC?
[0:09:38] <+Chimeraelite> Bro that Ikaruga vid was amazing
[0:09:40] <%crybirb> @Saltmeisterr, I see as that yeah for sure.
[0:09:42] <DextralMalin> ZeroRanger has some difficult score challenges
[0:09:43] <dai_tonight> or pure platinums in bayonettas
[0:09:45] <%RyTYoung> Time attack yay, score attack nay
[0:09:49] <%dds333a> Like fucking hotline miami, GOD that shit is insane sometimes
[0:09:54] <leith_aziz> @mothdude It feels like SMOKIN SEXY STYLE!
[0:09:59] <puluxor> Max chai-! Max chai-! Max chai-!
[0:10:02] <velgaduere> rankings are better than score, because they represent a tangible threshold. there are only so many rankings, and numbers start to lose meaning fairly quickly
[0:10:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:10:06] <Saltmeisterr> @crybirb ye those are the score attack games i really like
[0:10:21] <BlackermanZX> im a sucker for ranking in games
[0:10:26] <Lunalios> ranks are a fun way to make me interested in scores. DMC and bayonetta ask you to have certain abilities to be considered exceptional in their game
[0:10:40] <BlackermanZX> Mega man zero fucked me up and now i always try to go for S rank
[0:10:47] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb yep, and when stuff got challenged batman turned into devilamn, if that is less infringing lmao
[0:10:48] <dai_tonight> Ranking systems are fun until I start sucking then they stop being as fun.
[0:10:52] <%adamisbarely3d> Bullet hell is THE genre I will always admire from a distance. Just can't track moving objects fast enough to keep up

[0:11:04] <djblue_shift> MMZ's system was turbo fucked lol
[0:11:08] <RyuuAoi> Taunt to keep that chain going
[0:11:09] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, yo Batman: Devilman spinoff would be a banger not gonna lie
[0:11:09] <%adamisbarely3d> killed my ability to enjoy gungeon, too.
[0:11:12] <Lunalios> ranking systems give some flash and precision behind an arbitrary number
[0:11:21] <Saltmeisterr> although, i like horde modes as an addition to a game, rather than the only gamemode
[0:11:22] <leith_aziz> I think what im getting from chat is that rankings give you an idea on what to do improve and show you where to go from here
[0:11:23] <CappuccinoGuil> I feel Woolie is describing an FFXIV EX Trial
[0:11:33] <+Chimeraelite> That dance is how some people describe FF14. It's DDR+a rhythm game
[0:11:35] <Lunalios> which makes monkey neurons go off in my head
[0:11:43] <dai_tonight> imagine if souls-like bosses all had a timer
[0:11:45] <Saltmeisterr> mr x nightmare is one of my favs
[0:11:46] <%X2Eliah> whens the new FF Chaos game coming out?
[0:11:47] <%MajorCrasher> it is indeed 2D FF14
[0:11:52] <%dds333a> A NEW RECORD
[0:11:53] <DSD24> Break the Targets!
[0:11:53] <+DACH33ZMAN> SUCCESS!
[0:11:55] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb pretty sure theres a "regular" godzilla in there somewhere too, but its been a while since I played some of them
[0:12:01] <dai_tonight> @X2Eliah Like two weeks, no?
[0:12:01] <Saltmeisterr> SUCCESS
[0:12:04] <AzureHawk_Streams> Pacifism on a shoot 'em up? I guess there's always something to everybody...
[0:12:06] <+Chimeraelite> Do your rotations right, but also watch the boss and patterns
[0:12:13] <velgaduere> @leith_aziz agreed. having a tangible, conceivable goal is better than swimming through an ocean of arbitrary, meaningless numbers

[0:24:28] <+LazyAss24Seven> I had a thing where there was "mayo" IN the chicken....it was a cyst doodBarf

[0:24:39] <%dds333a> I hope none of y'all eat mayonnaise Kappa
[0:24:41] <AzureHawk_Streams> That doesn't sound good even in normal conditions
[0:24:41] <RyuuAoi> Buttermilk, flour, oil, and seasoning. That's it!
[0:24:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> @LazyAss24Seven AHHHHH

[0:25:01] <andre11dr> Mayo shouldn't touch chicken unless you're making chikage sandwiches
[0:25:02] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Reggie has evolved into a PC
[0:25:03] <wallynon> man reggie's looking different
[0:25:03] <%X2Eliah> Reggie sent back to his home planet

[0:25:17] <AmazingBlanket> my pc was built on their stream yesterday. was pretty cool to watch
[0:25:20] <leith_aziz> I need to buy an external harddrive so I dont need to delete games anymore
[0:25:22] <%holydeviant1> Part of me wants them to find a smaller ad specifically just to cover reggie
[0:25:24] <%LastHazzerd> @Dakuu75 twitch has italics?
[0:25:26] <%arkv01> damn reggie you're worth two bills
[0:25:28] <exnuart> should just build a sign for reggie to hold one day lol
[0:25:32] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @holydeviant1 lmao
[0:25:37] <%RemedyofRevenge> It'll give you an error message if parts arent compatible, so no worry about that on that end! - Me, a customer of Artesian B @WoolieVersus
[0:25:39] <%dds333a> phew he's back
[0:25:41] <deviljhojho_> hold up poulet mayo?
[0:25:45] <+nochejunior> read an article where they called this game the "deyassifying" of bloodborne lol
[0:25:48] <Dakuu75> @LastHazzerd if you use the command "/me" before typing, yeah
[0:25:49] <%Lunalios> Artesian builds vs. dark souls 2

[0:26:34] <dai_tonight> @leith_aziz can't wait for them to announce umm nothing
[0:26:47] <petwisk> the discount IS $200 on your current currency só for me It was WAY LESS than 200 dollars
[0:26:49] <%dds333a> @dai_tonight as always LUL
[0:26:56] <Dakuu75> @LastHazzerd I think it shows italics for us in chat but, streamers see it as your name's color. (it use to be like that)
[0:27:12] <DSD24> "You will lose your souls"
[0:27:16] <+upsettie> Woolie has become Patt
[0:27:24] <%Lion_kun> Woolie doing the prep for Reggie vs DS2
[0:27:24] <MeImoth> I still enjoy DS2
[0:27:25] <petwisk> since BR R$ IS a Very low currency
[0:27:30] <Xaeveax> He's prepping for Reggarths return
[0:27:31] <%dds333a> @dsd24 over and over again Kappa Kappa
[0:27:32] <%X2Eliah> scholar of 1st sin, or OG?

[0:27:33] <%CisealNine> Not bad, just awkward.
[0:27:41] <%Lunalios> lmao, I went on the exactly same order as woolie back in 2014 onward
[0:27:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Started from the bottom
[0:27:49] <%Lion_kun> Woolie only liked DS for Sif
[0:27:50] <Solidnick18> just in time for elden ring
[0:27:53] <%mr_sups> @X2Eliah Scholar
[0:27:54] <exnuart> hes playing scholar
[0:27:57] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:28:00] <+Jiggisnipe> @X2Eliah he said on the pod that it was SOTFS
[0:28:00] <Al_VII> Ooooh ELDEN RING
[0:28:04] <andre11dr> DS2 is not a bad place to start cause it only goes up from there LUL
[0:28:04] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:28:05] <%X2Eliah> oki
[0:28:05] <Treasure_Vault> Speedrun GO
[0:28:06] <Solidnick18> scholar is soooooooo long
[0:28:09] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:28:09] <DSD24> Metal Gear Starts at MGS5
[0:28:10] <%lord_woodsy> I hope Woolie channels pat when we get to Reggie Vs Dark Souls 2
[0:28:12] <+DatAsuna> Good, I didn't miss the start
[0:28:13] <%X2Eliah> scholar is gonna be real hard
[0:28:16] <w_khan> LUL
[0:28:18] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus who's gonna be at the helm for Elden Ring?
[0:28:24] <andre11dr> Woolie you played Halo 20 years later LUL
[0:28:28] <%arkv01> go hard KINGS FIELD LETS GOOOOO
[0:28:30] <Xaeveax> I really hope you guys do Elden Ring on here.
[0:28:32] <%Deekman> sick
[0:28:35] <%Theycallmenerf> @dsd24 Actually it starts at MGS3
[0:28:38] <Dakuu75> he called dibs
[0:28:40] <Xaeveax> So excited
[0:28:42] <+DatAsuna> Did Woolie play scholar in his own time?
[0:28:44] <DSD24> @Theycallmenerf This is accurate
[0:28:46] <%CisealNine> Oh, Elden Ring LP?
[0:28:47] <RyuuAoi> I mean Reggie do DS3 and you do Elden Ring. First to beat wins the blood pool
[0:28:47] <+upsettie> Woolsworth IIII
[0:28:48] <Pookiedaexzile> No casterbuild I guess
[0:28:49] <%Lunalios> Iz bluuud
[0:28:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> GIVE IT TO REGGIE! LUL
[0:28:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> I think Reggie's seen enough Souls to appreciate Elden Ring
[0:28:51] <dai_tonight> remember when MGS5 was gonna be a game starring The Boss
[0:28:53] <Solidnick18> i'm at the helm cause i'm gonna play it.
[0:28:54] <%zwn582kw56tt5k> Captain Woolington
[0:28:57] <%Indigo_Automaton> It'll be like travelling to the future
[0:28:57] <%Lion_kun> We will get Reggie vs Elden Ring one day
[0:28:57] <%adamisbarely3d> the obvious solution is woolie plays elden ring on one screen, while shouting commentary at reggie while HE plays DS3
[0:28:59] <+DatAsuna> If not then despite the downsides, the new changes will be of value
[0:29:00] <dai_tonight> a prequel to a prequel
[0:29:01] <DSD24> Yoooo Freedom Unite!
[0:29:01] <%DashXero> THAT quest!
[0:29:02] <%Deekman> Or what if: Winner of the next Dokapon helms Elden Ring

[0:30:22] <@Solidus_113> yeah you never beat jevil
[0:30:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Sekiro is the only FromSoft game I didn’t play.
[0:30:29] <%dds333a> I beat my head against Sigma in MMX1 for so long that I almost lost my mind
[0:30:32] <leith_aziz> The dive attack usually killed everyone even when guarding
[0:30:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O multiple guys
[0:30:45] <Treasure_Vault> @DashXero Learning one makes the double approachable. But you gotta learn one.
[0:30:48] <RyuuAoi> He could be lying to doe, Woolie

[0:31:26] <%RemedyofRevenge> Never forget the fan game advice "If you are making a dope ass fan game, shut the fuck up until its released."
[0:31:31] <dabeaminator> @nintega010 Wouldn't it be Teppen?
[0:31:33] <%Javaa01> Worst case, they do what Microsoft did and use the community thing as free market research
[0:31:35] <%Lion_kun> If only they would let my favorite vtubers stream their games.

[0:42:52] <toulon_somberjade> Told ya
[0:42:56] <secret_npc> if we're playing a psx game, maybe an old-school style recording is appropriate........
[0:43:00] <mudox1717> hes got the old version
[0:43:00] <RyuuAoi> Point the camera at the screen, Woolie!
[0:43:01] <ianabstract> Such a demake it even demakes your capture setup
[0:43:03] <AstrodropGaming> Boot it in Windowed mode idk
[0:43:05] <+0neReeler> burn the psx disc
[0:43:08] <KeiganOfAstora> Why does everyone keep saying "let it die" and "it's over". I know that. I'm not asking to bring that era back. I just like seeing how LPs are made. Nothing personal about that
[0:43:12] <KeiganOfAstora> No worries thoug
[0:43:13] <Solidnick18> oh well
[0:43:18] <@Solidus_113> add it in post
[0:43:21] <%Lunalios> demake into a camera at the tv
[0:43:23] <dai_tonight> Just play the ps1 sound off youtube idk
[0:43:24] <spaceitaly> Shameful amount of technical problems from a Sony first party title, smh
[0:43:29] <jmepik> oh shit
[0:43:30] <velgaduere> it's chat's fault for asking that stupid-ass question
[0:43:32] <KeiganOfAstora> Big old on
[0:43:33] <%crybirb> @KeiganOfAstora, if you been around here for some time you know this annoys woolie and everyone involved everytime someone asks about that.
[0:43:35] <velgaduere> doodStare
[0:43:39] <stukamod> This is just how it is
[0:43:39] <jmepik> hell yeah point the camera at the TV, ancient LP style
[0:43:40] <Abok6> change the cover to PAL and it'll be fine Kappa
[0:43:40] <dai_tonight> Its ok man
[0:43:41] <%X2Eliah> @spaceitaly welllll its not exactly a sony thing
[0:43:41] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus make sure to use Remastered preset unless you want god aweful fps
[0:43:43] <%Kungfuski> it can only be recorded at 48p
[0:43:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Hey I know you're wrestling technical difficulties right now, but would you like to talk about this ugly topic as well?"
[0:43:45] <iacus_> yeah the "let it die" mentality is some anti-historical shit, man.
[0:43:45] <%spootynook> This is why I bought an N64 instead of the PS1
[0:43:46] <%dds333a> @kungfuski "back story" LUL
[0:43:47] <KeiganOfAstora> So just never bring up SBFP at all, ever, in any context?
[0:43:47] <+0neReeler> bloodborne 60fps finally?
[0:43:47] <Joco2222> pog trouble shooting content
[0:43:50] <leith_aziz> Why is it called PSX? Not PS1?
[0:43:50] <RyuuAoi> We know why we are here, Woolie. It's cool.
[0:43:54] <%crybirb> @KeiganOfAstora, yes. Never bring it up.
[0:43:54] <Xaeveax> You would thing for a full priced game this would have been ironed out. LUL
[0:43:58] <KeiganOfAstora> Alright, fair enough
[0:44:04] <%D4C_Trice> I hope the ps1 disc isn't scratched
[0:44:06] <rasamune> @spaceitaly tis a jest, a jape even
[0:44:07] <RyuuAoi> @leith_aziz That's what it is.
[0:44:11] <spaceitaly> @spaceitaly I know, I'm having a little giggle, a little jape
[0:44:11] <stukamod> The real MVP
[0:44:12] <pennykettle_> blow on the cart
[0:44:16] <gespenstkick> Muffled Pat in the distance: "Now hold on..."
[0:44:16] <AzureHawk_Streams> will you?
[0:44:16] <%spootynook> @leith_aziz It was the original name before it was released and it just stuck
[0:44:18] <Abok6> @0neReeler never! Bloodborne PSX should be played exclusively in 24fps
[0:44:20] <%Lunalios> woolie (plz) figure this out
[0:44:22] <taeko_ohnuki> what's reggie doing? pulling plugs?
[0:44:23] <dai_tonight> Woolie put some tooth paste on the disc
[0:44:25] <DXLelouch24> No autosave either so rotate those saves
[0:44:25] <%TigerCatGo> Blow on the PSX disc
[0:44:26] <%Deekman> Fear the re plug
[0:44:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> UNPLUG REPLUG
[0:44:28] <matchagremlin> lick the disc
[0:44:29] <%RyTYoung> @keiganofastora it’s probably fans being over sbfp that are telling you to let it die, I think it would be cool if they did a doc about their video production, but if it’s too personal for them to go into the details it won’t be worth it for them
[0:44:30] <+Kharinite> take all the time you need. we're just here chilling
[0:44:31] <+trackles_64> Sure it was
[0:44:31] <+0neReeler> psx probably coined during ps1 era
[0:44:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> lets fuckin go
[0:44:33] <stukamod> LUL
[0:44:35] <andre11dr> Damn Sony ,you really gonna put your first party titles out here in this state? Kappa
[0:44:36] <ospreyworks> flush the ps1 disc
[0:44:39] <gespenstkick> blow on it
[0:44:39] <Crownaux0> :(
[0:44:41] <AzureHawk_Streams> Put the PSX straight up
[0:44:42] <%X2Eliah> Bloodborne (in any platfofm) should be a fluid 12 - 24 fps
[0:44:45] <+tempestzephyr> woolie will figure it out, maybe LUL
[0:44:46] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus, restart everything unplugged and then plug? This works for my 3080.
[0:44:47] <%arkv01> spit on the disc and rub it
[0:44:48] <+Prism_Zet> @WoolieVersus what software you using? i fixed mine live ang got it startup and everything
[0:44:51] <%Hapsam> shake the elgato

[0:44:54] <%dds333a> @ryuuaoi yeah, here to see them play videogames Kappa

[0:45:05] <Reilata> Stream does not have enough insight to see the game.
[0:45:06] <KeiganOfAstora> Just do that, it's okay
[0:45:08] <%Bluwizard21> @WoolieVersus It helped pat last night
[0:45:10] <dai_tonight> Call max (un ironically)

[0:45:27] <zepelinnn1> "works for me :) "
[0:45:28] <andre11dr> Kick the PS1 3 times and say the magic words
[0:45:29] <Solidnick18> just give it an old smack Kappa
[0:45:30] <YuushAnthy> tech trouble shooting asmr
[0:45:31] <%crybirb> That's why Max has one machine just for the stream, so he can restart without killing the stream.
[0:45:32] <pennykettle_> Can anyone who already beat BB-PSX confirm that there isn't some late game spoilers for funsies?

[0:47:55] <Dr_Mooose> but it looked nice
[0:47:55] <%golforo> Purple disc >>
[0:47:58] <kes009900> i thought this disc had some kinda curse in it. from some guy that sold to a kid....
[0:47:58] <%Indigo_Automaton> The WORST
[0:48:01] <KeiganOfAstora> Who cares
[0:48:01] <pennykettle_> oh no they dont have the patched version lmao

[0:48:04] <%Lunalios> it came out the day I was born! back in '98
[0:48:05] <samuraijakanddaxter> let's gooo
[0:48:06] <+GilroyGoldBlood> The Night Unfurls is such a sick song
[0:48:06] <slipdog> this shit better have tank controls
[0:48:08] <andre11dr> I like how the music i a little muffled LUK
[0:48:08] <%Kungfuski> No fuck you the Mvc2 ps2 disc was the best is eva unit 1 purple
[0:48:11] <CanonHusbando> I liked the blue ps2 disks
[0:48:11] <%spootynook> It was supposed to stop piracy but didn't at all
[0:48:11] <leith_aziz> I tried the game once. It's a shame I kept getting lost and gave up
[0:48:11] <Crownaux0> glad they got the PS1 working
[0:48:12] <%arkv01> good hunter... insert disc 2
[0:48:13] <%TigerCatGo> I bought the original disc a Swapmeet
[0:48:14] <%D4C_Trice> Bloodborne was the spiritual sequel to nightmare creatures
[0:48:15] <$guiltyboya> Retroborne
[0:48:19] <+cdrom321> So this is going to played on a PS1, right.
[0:48:19] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus, There's a new version, this one has bugs in it, 1.02
[0:48:22] <+Tucker0603> those purple discs were awesome
[0:48:22] <ospreyworks> what's broken in 1.0??
[0:48:23] <otakon17> >20 FPS cap
[0:48:23] <Blank9> Wii U rounded edge discs are the best discs
[0:48:27] <Treasure_Vault> so far into the future you have to look backwards
[0:48:28] <Louie_Salmon> FPS capped at 20 by DEFAULT
[0:48:29] <+mace210> a sneak peak of things to come :)
[0:48:31] <ospreyworks> uh oh
[0:48:32] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus you need 1.01 not 1.00
[0:48:35] <+TungstenoViperante> Aliasing?
[0:48:36] <otakon17> this is insane
[0:48:37] <BlackermanZX> oh v1.02 was released recently LUL
[0:48:38] <CanonHusbando> Endgame drop rates are bugged
[0:48:39] <leith_aziz> nfl the amount of settings is insane. Puts some devs to shame
[0:48:39] <Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus if you wanna get rid of that reflection in the top left. it's "glossy" something
[0:48:39] <%arkv01> hollup what 720p? thats way too much HD
[0:48:40] <KeiganOfAstora> Remember when the first TV was turned on and it displayed Dark Souls 1 DLC? Those were the good ol' days
[0:48:40] <JowiJoestar> mad respect to them for going this hard
[0:48:42] <leith_aziz> *ngl
[0:48:42] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> not a fan of thet FPS
[0:48:43] <+mace210> or u could say dreams to come
[0:48:43] <dai_tonight> Damn
[0:48:44] <iacus_> lol, they exposed every parameter in the crt shader haha
[0:48:44] <@Menitta> "man I hate how modern games require multiple discs"
[0:48:45] <DSD24> Presets are nice
[0:48:46] <otakon17> make it run at least at 30 FPS please
[0:48:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> up that FPS cap tho
[0:48:47] <+saltpiggu> can you be girl tho
[0:48:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone play this on Tube tv
[0:48:50] <+0neReeler> warp: on
[0:48:51] <pennykettle_> There.s 1.02. But FUCK IT, PS1 games couldnt get patched, neither can this
[0:48:53] <DXLelouch24> @blackermanzx what it do?
[0:48:55] <Mr_Rakjo> Presets are Nice to check @WoolieVersus
[0:48:56] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus it might be wise to get the most recent updated version
[0:48:57] <%dds333a> @0nereeler I first heard it around PS2 to differentiate a bit more from PS1
[0:48:58] <spaceitaly> Look at all those options Sony didn't bother putting on the PS1 Mini
[0:48:59] <puluxor> Silky smooth 20fps sajamGuapo
[0:49:00] <%Namillus> Flip through those presets
[0:49:01] <@Solidus_113> I couldn't get my controller to work
[0:49:03] <VidulaSaix> There are some bugs you might run into
[0:49:03] <%Prevot> still doesn't look shitty enough

[1:01:36] <+Kharinite> @Order_of_Mystery im done lol
[1:01:37] <+parazoa42> Trbld

[1:01:41] <@Solidus_113> violent past or nothing
[1:01:41] <%golforo> WASTE OF SKIN
[1:01:41] <Solidnick18> YEP
[1:01:43] <+trackles_64> Years ahead
[1:01:43] <+0neReeler> WASTE
[1:01:49] <Solidnick18> waste of skin
[1:01:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> reggie's getting a peek
[1:01:51] <%Juriasu> Trblb.
[1:01:51] <CanonHusbando> Curves being angular is so funny what a killer joke
[1:01:53] <%X2Eliah> STATS ARE SO SIMPLE HERE
[1:01:53] <DSD24> Violent Past lets go
[1:01:55] <CappuccinoGuil> Hot Take: I don't like BB stats
[1:01:56] <Yomamma1337> in BB there are only 2 good origins
[1:01:57] <%X2Eliah> SO GOOD
[1:02:03] <%crybirb> Bloodtinger is useless with besides what, 2 weapons?
[1:02:08] <Yomamma1337> no clue how bbpsx stats are
[1:02:19] <%Prevot> BB is the most simplified stats, and its WAY better
[1:02:20] <+SilverDevilfish> "Pump endurance" - Pat
[1:02:23] <%arkv01> oh no riot's gonna sue this game
[1:02:24] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> I never figured out the werewolf stat, just ignored it
[1:02:24] <dai_tonight> what is bloodtinge
[1:02:24] <+Order_of_Mystery> years? reggies only got ds2 to chug thru till he hits BB
[1:02:30] <renyrells> my lifestyle determines my Milquetoast style
[1:02:32] <+za7az> @crybirb Pretty much, but it is GOD LIKE for those weapons
[1:02:32] <dai_tonight> ohhh
[1:02:34] <Yomamma1337> Bloodtinge is basically useless though
[1:02:34] <MeImoth> Bloodtinge best stat
[1:02:38] <+saltpiggu> bloodtinge effects all guns what you talkin about
[1:02:38] <otakon17> Arcane is also LUCK
[1:02:39] <%crybirb> @dai_tonight, I think it's riposte damage, but it's used for Chikage
[1:02:39] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Order_of_Mystery that's so long from now
[1:02:43] <pennykettle_> health/stamina + the 4 weapon types
[1:02:44] <%Juriasu> Chikage my Beloved
[1:02:45] <+Bailey__Gaming> Bloodtinge build baby
[1:02:46] <OblivionSword1> and magic damage
[1:02:48] <%Lunalios> blüdtinge is good shit
[1:02:50] <%X2Eliah> you dont use guns for dmg
[1:02:50] <CanonHusbando> Blood tinge is gun damage and it rules
[1:02:54] <%crybirb> @za7az, yeah for Chikage it's necessary, thank god Chikage is mixed with dex so you can go full dex until you get it.
[1:02:56] <otakon17> there is NO equip load YAY
[1:02:57] <+0neReeler> good ole STR
[1:02:58] <+trackles_64> Fuck equp load
[1:03:00] <%Lion_kun> I can't wait for Woolie to give this exact same explanation in a year or two
[1:03:01] <+inktoxicant> FASHIONBORNE
[1:03:03] <+mace210> yessir
[1:03:06] <pennykettle_> @Lion_kun same lmao
[1:03:07] <otakon17> but the clothes BARELY add defense :<
[1:03:09] <karawra> fashionborne
[1:03:10] <CanonHusbando> Arcane is also magic and arcane builds are big OP
[1:03:10] <dai_tonight> man I hope sony releases bloodborne on pc soon
[1:03:10] <andre11dr> Bloodtinge also affects certain spells
[1:03:12] <SQDizzy> YEAH FUCK SHIELDS
[1:03:13] <Solidnick18> love that fashion
[1:03:18] <dai_tonight> I really wanna play it
[1:03:20] <yukichocomilk> it's so cool that they eventually made a ps4 remake of this classic ps1 game
[1:03:21] <+za7az> @crybirb I ran a 40 dex 40 blood tinge to rock that shit. It was amazing
[1:03:21] <purplemoonhex> essence is misspelled
[1:03:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> forget everything you thought you knew
[1:03:25] <Treasure_Vault> Not true, equip load effects stamina regen, right? Like wearing the lamp increases it in bloodborne?
[1:03:26] <andre11dr> Sadly Arcane is kinda trash
[1:03:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @SQDizzy I will shield bash you, CHILD I SWEAR TO GOD
[1:03:28] <w_khan> Not on DS3 tho
[1:03:30] <+Order_of_Mystery> Fashionborne bby
[1:03:30] <pennykettle_> Oh yea, there are typos from the OG game that the dev left in
[1:03:33] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> there is a shield for a single purpose though, which isn't blocking most attacks lol
[1:03:40] <Yomamma1337> @Treasure_Vault nope.  the lamp thing was a bug that was immediately patched
[1:03:41] <dai_tonight> waste of skin tho
[1:03:42] <%jinking79> bloodtinge helps out with duel wielding too
[1:03:46] <w_khan> Arcane is only decent ng+
[1:03:47] <CanonHusbando> Except the hidden equip load stat that effects poise and stamina regen
[1:03:48] <%crybirb> @za7az, it is! Chikage is my fav weapon, but it's totally a useless attribute if you're not going exactly for Chikage and the Blood Spike hammer of the DLC
[1:03:55] <Raldavar> Shotgun does 650 damage per shot at 50 bloodtinge and cost no stamina
[1:03:56] <slipdog> i had a 1shot arcane build used to get so much hatemail i had to turn off messaging from non friends
[1:03:56] <Treasure_Vault> @Treasure_Vault Gotcha, didn't know.
[1:03:57] <otakon17> the Mage
[1:03:57] <peachy996> No spoilers past Central Yharnam, Yeah?

[1:04:25] <DSD24> Pockets has that Berserker style strength
[1:04:25] <pennykettle_> How does an Arcane build even work in a version of the game with only the first level lol
[1:04:27] <%Nested_Dreams> Pockets woke up to VIOLENCE

[1:06:52] <CanonHusbando> The ECHO on the footsteps
[1:06:52] <Dogking16> This game couldn't work on PSx because the camera is over thr shoulder and not static isometric

[1:07:04] <+solzan2000> oldschool
[1:07:06] <AngryAsian5> DEAR GOD

[1:07:07] <+TopTieramisu> the real iosefka is a sweetheart
[1:07:09] <%emptyantics> 10/10 design
[1:07:09] <+saltpiggu> triggers for camera
[1:07:10] <dai_tonight> this is an early ps1 game
[1:07:11] <+TopTieramisu> the imposter is a bitch
[1:07:11] <andre11dr> So will Woolie die to the first beast?
[1:07:12] <+0neReeler> ps1 had analogs
[1:07:12] <+inktoxicant> directional pad motherfucker

[1:07:31] <$hattrick61> souls with tank controls... giving me conniptions
[1:07:37] <%cache_22> So Jank controls not Tank controls?
[1:07:40] <TheMadDemoknight> @TopTieramisu I found some hidden gem of her dialogue, after using 4 vials she wants to meet you endgame
[1:07:40] <cheapdoc> GONNA GO BACK IN TIIIIME

[1:07:47] <@Menitta> It's like Mega Man Legends
[1:07:47] <BimboBagging> armored core!
[1:07:48] <YuushAnthy> oh my god
[1:07:48] <Ipsenscastle> it's not tank controls
[1:07:49] <%golforo> YEEEE
[1:07:49] <CappuccinoGuil> AS GOD FUCKING INTENDED
[1:07:49] <derap41> PS1 before Ape escape
[1:07:50] <BlackermanZX> as it should
[1:07:51] <+DrFacilier> The PS4 remake of this game ruined the aesthetic
[1:07:51] <AngryAsian5> Pimp hand STRONG
[1:07:51] <+LazyAss24Seven> YEAH BABY
[1:07:52] <CanonHusbando> Does it have armored core camera controls
[1:07:52] <cossuoldm> YEEEEEEEE
[1:07:52] <pennykettle_> but wait how do you parry
[1:07:52] <ShinyVagikarp> Ala spyro yeyeyeye
[1:07:53] <Renzaku69> So is this just a one to one recreation or did they change some stuff?
[1:07:53] <%Juriasu> but... what about heavy attack?
[1:07:54] <AzureHawk_Streams> AS YOU DO
[1:07:54] <+saltpiggu> PS1 didn't have analogs till late, and most games didn't support them
[1:07:55] <DancesWitBalrog> BACK IN THE DAY
[1:07:56] <Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:07:56] <%Lunalios> omg....
[1:07:56] <+Order_of_Mystery> oh yikes

[1:07:59] <+deltachief47> wait wait is this new mod?
[1:08:03] <+TopTieramisu> @TheMadDemoknight yeah. she was too pure for this world
[1:08:07] <%crybirb> I love PS1 demakes but I'm not up for the PS1 control schemes. Ape Escape already used analogs ffs.
[1:08:07] <%livlinn> Oh it’s woolz. Of course it’s Woolz
[1:08:07] <NickHatesSnow> THE BEST CONTROLS
[1:08:08] <captain_elsewhere> god i hated r1 l1 camera controlls
[1:08:08] <AstrodropGaming> Classic camera controls as God wills it
[1:08:08] <andre11dr> Wait so how do you shoot?
[1:08:08] <Treasure_Vault> They didn't know!
[1:08:09] <pennykettle_> ShinyVagikarp it was so hard to go back to that playing spyro
[1:08:09] <CanonHusbando> That’s MML 100%
[1:08:11] <Kit_XIV_> It's a standalone fan demake
[1:08:12] <Rancaliber_> Yo chat, I stepped away for a bit. What class did we pick?
[1:08:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> Mental
[1:08:15] <CanonHusbando> Bring it back

[1:08:38] <Rancaliber_> Sick, thanks.
[1:08:45] <ShinyVagikarp> @pennykettle_ ikr! I'll settle with the reignited trilogy
[1:08:47] <$guiltyboya> If I made a retro looking game, I would NOT make it with retro mechanics. But that's just me
[1:08:47] <+Prism_Zet> oh you still get trick, but its jank lmao
[1:08:49] <No3rdImpactPlz> Does anyone here know if this works in DuckStation (a ps1 emulator)?
[1:08:50] <%Major_Lee_> Thanks I hate it
[1:08:59] <pennykettle_> YEAAAA

[1:10:20] <+mace210> not berserk at all Kappa

[1:10:37] <No3rdImpactPlz> @otakon17 Thank you
[1:10:40] <+parazoa42> Some things are also Devilman references.
[1:10:46] <$guiltyboya> @Ipsenscastle sure. But as much as I like retro-looking games, I don't necessarily like their controls. Recently coming back to the og Tomb Raider games was a huge wiplash, for exemple
[1:10:47] <andre11dr> DS3 straight up has a Berserk best
[1:10:47] <%crybirb> Not everything is an Undertale reference woolieSMUG
[1:10:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> No pants huh?
[1:10:48] <Vyneci> Now everything being a JoJo reference on the other hand...
[1:10:53] <@Solidus_113> no pants no shoes
[1:10:55] <+DatAsuna> Not everything is 100% original and that's fine. Metal Gear 2 is explicitly rambo 3. lol
[1:10:55] <%brisk_dacat> It is when Woolie is involved
[1:10:56] <+Order_of_Mystery> fastforward to years from now to Reggarthin the hamlet

[1:11:54] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Woolie spoiling Reggie
[1:11:55] <@Menitta> Reggie is gonna go into real Bloodborne with his mind blown
[1:11:55] <gespenstkick> Everything is either a Berserk, Treasure Island, or Cthulhu mythos reference.
[1:11:56] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus Full playthrough when?
[1:11:56] <+cdrom321> Is this Anor Londo?
[1:11:57] <slipdog> then again we just confirmed it for him not really helping
[1:11:58] <DSD24> That is just Armored Core
[1:11:59] <pennykettle_> Saying its a spoiler might be more of a spoiler if you make him think about it
[1:12:02] <$guiltyboya> This whole demake is spoilers LUL
[1:12:03] <DSD24> Its the same font
[1:12:04] <DXLelouch24> Reggie will forget its fine Chat
[1:12:09] <slipdog> @pennykettle_ LUL
[1:12:11] <Reilata> When he revisits this later with the future version will certainly be a trip.
[1:12:11] <%Lunalios> no equipment is pretty bright

[1:12:20] <otakon17> god those SFX
[1:12:24] <CanonHusbando> What are you talking about woolie bloodborne is just universal monsters like werewolves and draculas
[1:12:24] <dai_tonight> when they play the real thing n 2025 it will be lit
[1:12:34] <otakon17> Seek the blood
[1:12:36] <@Menitta> I wish I had a PS1 growing up
[1:12:37] <slipdog> ITs a werewolf hunting game
[1:12:45] <AstrodropGaming> You require more Paleblood
[1:12:46] <Boegame> i think the blood is important
[1:12:49] <MadBaller123> uhm, its a fashion simulation game actually
[1:12:50] <+vaderxyz1970> beware the cinnamon toast crunch

[1:20:11] <bunnyscruff> LOOKS SO GOOD
[1:20:11] <Boegame> DS2 estus plus life gems was the best, made the healing more indepth, it just needed a carry limit like in ds3
[1:20:11] <Kit_XIV_> That music
[1:20:12] <Dogking16> Easy mode is now selectable

[1:20:17] <CanonHusbando> actual goosebumps
[1:20:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:20:17] <Yomamma1337> or you can just go to the lamp

[1:20:24] <+DatAsuna> @Bailey__Gaming not even wrong lmao
[1:20:25] <%Deekman> generic zombie sounds
[1:20:26] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:20:28] <CanonHusbando> The tomb raider sound font

[1:20:32] <SoaringTrumpet> all the ost is really good
[1:20:34] <%mr_sups> FOG
[1:20:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @pennykettle_ and being a consumible is why they suck. If they gave you a set amount every time, I'd like them more. Stopping to grind sounds like a pain.
[1:20:36] <RyuuAoi> Reggie diggin it
[1:20:39] <Aussie_Manny> Member da Hunter's Dream? I member!

[1:20:42] <Voidvas> Another Berzerk Reference in the background
[1:20:42] <gespenstkick> 100% Nightmare Creatures
[1:20:42] <+solracc25> easy mode now selectable
[1:20:43] <dai_tonight> the texture jitter though
[1:20:43] <VidulaSaix> It really does
[1:20:44] <ShinyVagikarp> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:20:45] <%LastHazzerd> oh totally
[1:20:47] <%TigerCatGo> Is this Free?? I want to throw actual MONEY at the developer
[1:20:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah
[1:20:48] <+saltpiggu> that's fine
[1:20:49] <@Menitta> The hunters dream should run worse than everywhere else in the game for some reason
[1:20:50] <%LastHazzerd> but i like that
[1:20:51] <ShinyVagikarp> ACtually fantastic
[1:20:54] <+Rafraud> crash was pretty close
[1:20:55] <Dogking16> This game could never run on an actual psx
[1:20:55] <+yuribo26> Yeah, its a bit more than the ps1 could handle
[1:20:56] <Johannen> Silent Hill 1?
[1:20:56] <iacus_> that fog
[1:20:57] <+saltpiggu> vagrant story had ligting
[1:20:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah but shut up tho
[1:20:58] <bunnyscruff> It's too good!
[1:20:59] <$hattrick61> Try finger, and let the good blood guide your way.
[1:20:59] <+Lolo27234> it would be a late ps1 game
[1:21:00] <velgaduere> I can live with that
[1:21:00] <+DatAsuna> too much draw distance
[1:21:00] <+Bitscreed> Seeing Reggie technically experience Bloodborne for the first time but like this is so surreal
[1:21:00] <%LastHazzerd> i want the style, not the limitation
[1:21:01] <MadBaller123> its the Shovel Knight treatment
[1:21:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @TigerCatGo has to be free, or FromSoft and Sony would come cracking down
[1:21:03] <%Deekman> Will this actually play on a real PS1?
[1:21:04] <Big_Sister_Neko> Agree
[1:21:05] <derap41> Ape escape level?
[1:21:06] <RyuuAoi> Low key looks better than BB
[1:21:06] <dai_tonight> ok
[1:21:06] <+3d_pbandj> nooo nooo remember Vagrant Story!
[1:21:07] <b_ikki> reminds me more of ds games
[1:21:08] <otakon17> The abandoned doll..
[1:21:08] <cj_art> gotta love baked textures
[1:21:08] <AstrodropGaming> This is like Vagrant Story-level quality
[1:21:08] <CanonHusbando> Medieval looked like this
[1:21:08] <OblivionSword1> look too good to be on the actual PS1
[1:21:09] <+DatAsuna> We need that tenchu 1 draw distance
[1:21:10] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Ok
[1:21:11] <VidulaSaix> Doll Kreygasm
[1:21:11] <Boegame> big MARIO door :V
[1:21:13] <pennykettle_> trick. weapon.
[1:21:13] <$guiltyboya> Try tongue but hole
[1:21:13] <Solidnick18> wife
[1:21:13] <+Lolo27234> like ff9
[1:21:14] <Dogking16> The draw distance is too good
[1:21:15] <+bytex678> the doll is not evil
[1:21:15] <DSD24> Threaded Cane lets goooo
[1:21:15] <BGArmitage> the fog would be crazy for psx
[1:21:16] <captain_elsewhere> yaya vagrant story
[1:21:17] <@Menitta> it's made in UE4 iirc so no
[1:21:18] <+mace210> this would def had been GOTY if it came out during the appropriate time
[1:21:19] <Kit_XIV_> I hope someone makes it into an iso and plays it on PS1
[1:21:19] <peachy996> "shit demake, game looks too good"
[1:21:19] <+RaveBV> Yeah, it's definitely higher quality than PS1 games would be.
[1:21:23] <%Deekman> This sound track sounds like Myst lol
[1:21:23] <+RigniGardenki> no axe????

[1:21:58] <Renzaku69> This is Axe gang, suck it
[1:21:59] <RyuuAoi> Axe or nothing
[1:21:59] <andre11dr> Saw Cleaver, the most OP one
[1:21:59] <peachy996> Never Lets you down
[1:22:01] <Solidnick18> alright then
[1:22:09] <$guiltyboya> CANE IS THE ONLY WAY I like to Belmond my bloodborne
[1:22:11] <%crybirb> TBH Cleaver is just as broken as the Axe
[1:22:11] <gespenstkick> Konlulu
[1:22:17] <jmepik> i love the cleaver
[1:22:20] <+saltpiggu> thats a cool model
[1:22:20] <jmepik> so good
[1:22:22] <Yomamma1337> all of the starting weapons are A tier
[1:22:24] <@Menitta> The threaded cane turns the game into Castlevania and it's great
[1:22:26] <samuraijakanddaxter> cane gang
[1:22:28] <+RigniGardenki> cleaBer
[1:22:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cleaver is very strong early game, you fight exclusively beasts
[1:22:40] <SQDizzy> centrifugal force is fake tho
[1:22:40] <otakon17> use the SAW vs. BEASTS
[1:22:42] <Kit_XIV_> Can you straight razor flick out the cleaver in this demake?
[1:22:44] <+saltpiggu> Cane is like way harder in the original tho
[1:22:46] <peachy996> It's the Ryu
[1:22:48] <Solidnick18> it's pretty cool
[1:22:51] <velgaduere> The Most Balanced Weapon Ever™️
[1:22:52] <pennykettle_> GUN.
[1:22:53] <Yomamma1337> literally the highest dps weapon in the game.  thats such an understatement
[1:22:58] <@Menitta> it's way harder but it's SO COOL
[1:22:59] <%Juriasu> off you?
[1:22:59] <andre11dr> The Saw Cleaver is broken because the transform attack does so much damage
[1:23:00] <+RigniGardenki> @Kit_XIV_ no, transformations are done through a pause menu
[1:23:00] <DSD24> Weilded
[1:23:01] <SaintBeau> weilded
[1:23:01] <gespenstkick> pew pew
[1:23:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GUN
[1:23:01] <+gwanzan> what frame rate does this run at?
[1:23:04] <MadBaller123> which weapon is charmander/bulbasaur/squirtle
[1:23:05] <Dogking16> pistol
[1:23:05] <otakon17> I hate that they made guns SHORT RANGE PARRY weapons
[1:23:08] <Awesome_Leaf> lmao
[1:23:10] <Solidnick18> Pistol
[1:23:10] <slipdog> Blunderbussy
[1:23:13] <pennykettle_> Yes, typos are left in from the original game
[1:23:14] <$hattrick61> @gwanzan locked to 20
[1:23:14] <%Gamefriendly> i've started, but couldnt finish Bloodborne, why was the axe OP?
[1:23:16] <@Menitta> Bullets are merely a suggestion
[1:23:17] <+GilroyGoldBlood> bussin
[1:23:18] <buerdo> pistol
[1:23:20] <jmepik> R1 R2 combo on the cleaver is craaazy DPS
[1:23:20] <VidulaSaix> Pistol
[1:23:20] <+robertoszek> I feel like the music and sfx are pretty loud but the in-game voices are very quiet
[1:23:21] <otakon17> Blunderbuss is better for scoring parries
[1:23:24] <CanonHusbando> Do not say blunderbussy
[1:23:25] <bunnyscruff> Blunderbussy babeeee
[1:23:25] <+inktoxicant> PARRY GUN
[1:23:26] <+gwanzan> @hattrick61 at least it is locked
[1:23:27] <Yomamma1337> yikes shotgun over pistol
[1:23:28] <Revan175757> Sound is a bit too loud now?
[1:23:28] <%Deasmeister> blussy
[1:23:31] <pennykettle_> @Gamefriendly the held down strong attack is a giant spin attack that hits a lot
[1:23:34] <peachy996> Pistol is bettter but Blunderbuss looked cooler
[1:23:35] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> there are definitely intentional typos. The creator posted about a change they made to match a typo in the original.
[1:23:35] <SaintBeau> 2shotty
[1:23:35] <scizor285> let's go blunderbussy!
[1:23:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GUN. PARRIES.
[1:23:38] <@Menitta> the pistol sucks in the original
[1:23:40] <+parazoa42> @Gamefriendly Stagger, high damage, spin attack
[1:23:42] <+Mrbaconator> blussy
[1:23:42] <buerdo> pistol is better at parries
[1:23:42] <andre11dr> Pistol is actually better cause it's faster LUL
[1:23:45] <otakon17> that model is CHONKY
[1:23:47] <slipdog> the best choice for anything but a tinge build
[1:23:48] <hellhound123123> @Gamefriendly Cuz strong R2 is a giant double spin that was nicknamed Spin to Win
[1:23:50] <%brisk_dacat> Parry Pistol
[1:23:51] <Kit_XIV_> Parry this you filthy casuals LUL
[1:23:52] <MrLastChanceLearns> until you get that gun only run where the gun absolutley chunks everything
[1:23:57] <peachy996> @Menitta Not against certain Chalice assholes
[1:24:00] <Yomamma1337> @Menitta its almost objectively better for everything but bsb and djura
[1:24:00] <@Menitta> god I wanna replay the original now
[1:24:01] <+pandapeeps> The music is just great

[1:24:16] <jmepik> sadly you need to spam a few consumables (other than bullets) to be a gun god
[1:24:17] <Yomamma1337> @DXLelouch24 yes
[1:24:19] <VidulaSaix> Shields are for COWARDS
[1:24:28] <MadBaller123> endargers pasivity
[1:24:28] <BigYanno> Everything is blood in bloodborne

[1:26:27] <otakon17> lock on would work better it seems with the gun
[1:26:29] <peachy996> Oh it's locked off, man these people were really smart with this demake
[1:26:30] <+3d_pbandj> don't worry, just keep playing
[1:26:32] <AstrodropGaming> Old-school aiming f**kers
[1:26:32] <+Prism_Zet> tapping still shoots if locked on
[1:26:32] <DXLelouch24> You dont have to aim to parry its just an option
[1:26:34] <$guiltyboya> oh thnak god
[1:26:37] <+saltpiggu> how PS1
[1:26:38] <BlackermanZX> don't skip messenger boys
[1:26:38] <%brisk_dacat> Transform locked for now
[1:26:39] <Solidnick18> lets look at the messages
[1:26:43] <gespenstkick> "new" more like old huehue
[1:26:44] <%Deekman> this is just like how it was back in the day
[1:26:48] <%bruuzer12> blood bullets are locked in Iosefka's, transform is in the workshop
[1:26:48] <otakon17> Rally system is still here
[1:26:48] <CappuccinoGuil> You can't shoot from the hip because you have no bullets
[1:26:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hell yeah rally
[1:26:54] <peachy996> Sure you can demake graphics, but to demake IDEAS from modern gaming to the ps1 days is very smart
[1:27:03] <Louie_Salmon> Go IN
[1:27:07] <otakon17> it's known at the Rally system
[1:27:09] <@Menitta> God I still think about that Miyazaki quote about the health bar and what it actually represents
[1:27:14] <+gwanzan> those Messengers are adorable
[1:27:15] <gespenstkick> Hell is full, blood is health
[1:27:21] <otakon17> @Menitta what is that? explain
[1:27:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[1:27:24] <CanonHusbando> Your will to push on
[1:27:29] <CanonHusbando> So cool
[1:27:29] <ShinyVagikarp> AngelThump
[1:27:34] <Solidnick18> you get in that ass
[1:27:37] <Realignment3> hell yeah I just downloaded this earlier, can't wait to try it out for myself
[1:27:49] <+0neReeler> gunslinger
[1:27:51] <@Menitta> It's not your health, it's your hope against the despair and as you get hit you lose that hope, but hitting back regains hope. No hope left, all you have is despair.
[1:28:02] <Saltmeisterr> GUN PARRY
[1:28:07] <%atlasdotwav> Bro, bro! Wake up it’s 2001!!
[1:28:11] <@Menitta> ITS THE COOLEST THING EVER
[1:28:11] <CanonHusbando> Garry
[1:28:13] <pennykettle_> @Menitta I thought that was a Pat quote
[1:28:19] <%Gamefriendly> is this demake connected to online at all?
[1:28:20] <pennykettle_> wow I cant belive woolie guessed ____
[1:28:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Miyazaki sounds like an anime villain apparently
[1:28:37] <@Menitta> Oh god was that not real????
[1:28:45] <Yomamma1337> @Menitta no lol
[1:28:48] <+eanscrale> Online? in 1999?
[1:28:49] <Solidnick18> ok
[1:28:51] <@Menitta> AW COME ON
[1:28:54] <+DreyfussFrost> @Menitta It's real, I found the article
[1:29:01] <pennykettle_> @Menitta I know exactly what you are talking about, I think that was Pat on the podcast speculating about the mechanics lol
[1:29:02] <Louie_Salmon> @menitta Dude I think that's Undertale
[1:29:02] <@Menitta> okokok cool
[1:29:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @Menitta you got Patted LUL
[1:29:11] <%Namillus> @Menitta It's also your bestial instincts, because you can't Rally off things that have no blood and Viscerals always fully heal your rallyable health - so the act of showering yourself in your foes' blood reinvigorates you
[1:29:12] <+vdalson> bloodtinge build support????
[1:29:13] <+cahv123> Is this a nightmare creatures rip?
[1:29:13] <+bytex678> This whole mod was made by one lady btw
[1:29:15] <+DinnerCalzone> (while running)
[1:29:18] <Boegame> while sprinting woolie
[1:29:22] <Estuko> I'm sorry you got PatPilled Menitta
[1:29:24] <pennykettle_> YO
[1:29:27] <%atlasdotwav> That’s one talented lady
[1:29:27] <%Gamefriendly> but what about the messages tho
[1:29:29] <+DinnerCalzone> OH THAT'S SOME PS1 JANK
[1:29:30] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye
[1:29:32] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:29:33] <+Tucker0603> YOOOO
[1:29:33] <VidulaSaix> @bytex678 It was a team effort but she majority of it afaik
[1:29:36] <Realignment3> this is so sick
[1:29:37] <Solidnick18> yo what
[1:29:38] <DarkestDom> lol
[1:29:39] <linSP> YOOO
[1:29:41] <+DreyfussFrost> Chat, it's literally an article on Kotaku titled "Getting Up Close with Bloodborne's Combat"
[1:29:47] <peachy996> Nice
[1:29:48] <didipackums1> We got systems!!!
[1:29:58] <Yomamma1337> bloodborne dodges are sick
[1:29:59] <CappuccinoGuil> SHMOVING
[1:30:01] <slipdog> yakuza rush style
[1:30:01] <@Menitta> ok yeah no I'm not insane
[1:30:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> schmovin
[1:30:08] <Yomamma1337> @Menitta no pat is
[1:30:13] <VidulaSaix> Bloodborne is such a sick fucking game man
[1:30:16] <VidulaSaix> Bluepoint get on it!
[1:30:17] <@Solidus_113> it do
[1:30:22] <iacus_> This is making me want to go and play Bloodborne
[1:30:32] <CanonHusbando> Da bois
[1:30:36] <jmepik> "Masaaki Yamagawa, Bloodborne’s producer at Sony, explained Miyazaki’s own typically unique way of looking at the regain mechanic: rather than representing constitution, the health bar rather represents your mental state, your will to go on; your bravery, almost."
[1:30:38] <Solidnick18> yup
[1:30:44] <DSD24> Blood Doping is bad yall
[1:30:44] <Louie_Salmon> Music going ham
[1:30:45] <+vaderxyz1970> bluud
[1:30:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Please never let Bluepoint touch Bloodborne after what they did to Demon's Souls
[1:30:45] <cossuoldm> This music is amazing btw, great impression of the dream theme
[1:30:47] <+DreyfussFrost> Literally just googled "Miyazaki health bar" and it was the first result LUL
[1:30:58] <+gwanzan> @VidulaSaix I would be happier just for a PC version that runs at 60 fps locked
[1:30:59] <pennykettle_> In that case, thats awesome
[1:31:02] <%mundanelotus> Game a little too loud
[1:31:04] <mrtanaka111> is the demake like the complete game?dlc and all
[1:31:12] <jmepik> @Menitta don't be gaslit you're right
[1:31:21] <%holydeviant1> ...So where is Molotov in BB?
[1:31:26] <+bytex678> Next up: Sony buys Microsoft for 2 bazillion dollars
[1:31:29] <+samuraicaveman> it goes up to gaskwang
[1:31:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @jmepik That's neat and all, but it's called Health in-game, sooooo LUL
[1:31:30] <pennykettle_> @mrtanaka111 ends at Gascoigne. There's some extra content added in to puff it out
[1:31:30] <$hattrick61> @mrtanaka111 no, up to vicar emilia i believe
[1:31:33] <+solzan2000> bluepoint is defo on bloodborne
[1:31:35] <otakon17> Firebombs are great
[1:31:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:31:36] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah game audio could go down 10%
[1:31:36] <+plsnolookatme> @mrtanaka111 It only goes up to Gas-Coin IIRC
[1:31:42] <+eanscrale> they scale too
[1:31:42] <mrtanaka111> got it,thanks
[1:31:45] <slipdog> and they scale with arcane and strength LUL
[1:31:45] <+solzan2000> they did a great job of demons souls
[1:31:45] <%brisk_dacat> Yeah Fire in the bottle
[1:31:47] <pennykettle_> This game has reverse molotovs too
[1:31:49] <+patriotrenegade> Are they tho.
[1:31:50] <+DreyfussFrost> @jmepik Mental health is health Kappa
[1:31:56] <velgaduere> so Reggie VS Bloodborne starts tomorrow right?
[1:31:59] <Awesome_Leaf> are they?
[1:32:03] <gespenstkick> inb4 Reg throws away Woolie's molotovs
[1:32:05] <Ecliptic_Origins> the molotovs are so good
[1:32:06] <lotharrio> They're... okay?
[1:32:10] <$hattrick61> *quite thrilling
[1:32:10] <andre11dr> I always thought that the heal happened because you're getting drenched in blood and the hunters are part best
[1:32:12] <Awesome_Leaf> lol
[1:32:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie has been 2 steps ahead of Woolie in the consumible game, these items are GREAT... if you know what you're doing LUL
[1:32:32] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @andre11dr that's how regain works, yeah
[1:32:38] <damnglad> died 20 times to my friends baiken today i have no idea how to play chipp but goddamn was I going fast
[1:32:40] <%Namillus> @andre11dr The Blood Ministration brings out the animal side of a human, and that interplays with willpower.
[1:32:43] <iacus_> you can do the same in dark souls with throwing knives
[1:32:45] <pennykettle_> You can use molotovs to stagger bosses, I dont think firebombs could ever do that
[1:32:48] <Drusain> You can start with that?!
[1:32:51] <TheMadDemoknight> Noo
[1:32:53] <rasamune> This is early!
[1:32:54] <GeneralSCPatton> Oh, this is BIG EARLY
[1:32:55] <+Tucker0603> YOOK ALREADY HERE?!?!?
[1:32:59] <Louie_Salmon> Costs a LOT
[1:32:59] <didipackums1> Yo what
[1:33:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ALREADY???
[1:33:05] <buerdo> magic
[1:33:10] <$hattrick61> ten thousand
[1:33:10] <TheMadDemoknight> Don't tell Reggie!
[1:33:11] <pennykettle_> IS it early? Would the Arcane classes get that?
[1:33:13] <rasamune> 10,000 echoes though
[1:33:15] <ShinyVagikarp> arcane build is possible
[1:33:16] <peachy996> Lol they wanted to put that in early huh?
[1:33:19] <+Cybercobra2> makes sense. normaly you can get magic by the time this ends storywise
[1:33:20] <+inktoxicant> the one good Arcane thing
[1:33:23] <+Cybercobra2> cant get*
[1:33:27] <Boegame> arcane spell, gotta get it in here cause its quite late in real game
[1:33:28] <cossuoldm> Gotta make Arcane viable
[1:33:30] <+patriotrenegade> Yeah the Eldritch part of the game is introduced really early. @woolieversus
[1:33:31] <slipdog> arcane is viable in the first half now?
[1:33:31] <+Tucker0603> CRUEL FATE BUILD LETS GO!!!!
[1:33:32] <+inktoxicant> unless you get that eyeball from the DLC
[1:33:32] <Yomamma1337> @jmepik that quote isnt sourced, though at least   it seems pat didnt just mind goblin it up
[1:33:34] <slipdog> i back it
[1:33:36] <andre11dr> @namillus Yeah, what you do a riposte, you see the Hunters hand turns into a claw
[1:33:39] <+parazoa42> @pennykettle_ Arcane doesn't get shit until late game in the original.
[1:33:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Cybercobra2 oh yeah makes sense
[1:33:45] <Awesome_Leaf> <1>
[1:33:50] <Louie_Salmon> No online garden
[1:34:02] <Yomamma1337> @pennykettle_ not late game, you get a good arcane weapon after bsb
[1:34:02] <mrtanaka111> is this a fanmade project made official?looks great
[1:34:03] <+inktoxicant> ONE INSIGHT REQUIRED
[1:34:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> Awwww
[1:34:05] <%Namillus> @andre11dr Yeah you put your weapon down to just JAM your hand all up in there
[1:34:09] <+Antyriku2> i never knew that
[1:34:09] <TheMadDemoknight> Let's wait until Reggie actually plays Bloodborne
[1:34:09] <%Deekman> Can you take the PS1 CD out and put in your Reel Big Fish disk to change the soundtrack?
[1:34:09] <+inktoxicant> A BIG FUCKOFF EYE
[1:34:13] <slipdog> arcane builds get a spicy watering can
[1:34:14] <CappuccinoGuil> @mrtanaka111 not official, just fanmade
[1:34:17] <Kit_XIV_> @mrtanaka111 Fanmade aye
[1:34:18] <andre11dr> Arcane was sadly really bad in the original
[1:34:18] <pennykettle_> Guys don't forget how easily it is to notice foreshadowing if you already know
[1:34:22] <mrtanaka111> straight up fanmade
[1:34:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:34:31] <Yomamma1337> @andre11dr its literally the strongest build if you know what youre doing
[1:34:35] <leith_aziz> This is a fantastic Demake. Even the music sounds proper quality
[1:34:37] <+plsnolookatme> Yall clearly never played Arcane builds. Molotovs and Firespitter are literally the early game items for Arcane
[1:34:42] <VidulaSaix> OH SURE BLAME US LUL
[1:34:44] <zard9> excuses
[1:34:44] <%TigerCatGo> Loading hehe
[1:34:45] <slipdog> @andre11dr this is propaganda though, unlocked spell tech and 70+ arc was nuts. i was oneshotting fools
[1:34:48] <CanonHusbando> Arcane is great with the right build but that requires <chalice dungeon> grinding
[1:34:49] <%elderpunch> @slipdog and stinky tentacle hand whips
[1:34:49] <+DatAsuna> loads faster than real bloodborne
[1:34:51] <$hattrick61> take the plunge, but, hole
[1:34:55] <Louie_Salmon> Massive johns
[1:34:59] <slipdog> you could play mind games with unlocked spell casting
[1:34:59] <+parazoa42> @plsnolookatme I mean, like, spells.
[1:35:00] <%Namillus> Yeah but you don't get any overt Magic Bullshit until like halfway through at the earliest
[1:35:01] <%SuspiciousWaffler> ooooh shit, this is going to be an amazing playthrough
[1:35:06] <andre11dr> @yomamma1337 Or you can get a Chikage and spam R1 and melt everything
[1:35:08] <+gwanzan> does this have voice acting?
[1:35:12] <BlackermanZX> max missed the blood bullet thing i hope they dont miss it too
[1:35:12] <CanonHusbando> Ain’t nobody wanna grind the challenge dungeons
[1:35:14] <leith_aziz> @gwanzan Yes
[1:35:14] <+Reverend_Roscoe> yes
[1:35:15] <+inktoxicant> Every stat in Souls games has one person saying it's awful immediately followed by someone else saying it's the best stat in the game
[1:35:18] <%oneimportantthing> I can't believe how cool it is to use this as Reggie's first Bloodborne primer
[1:35:24] <peachy996> Not yet you don't
[1:35:25] <Solidnick18> she ain't having it
[1:35:28] <+gwanzan> shouldn't she be talking to you through the door?
[1:35:32] <cossuoldm> Arcane was a strong ass build. but until late game you were scrapping with sub par equipment and shit, really not fun until Rom
[1:35:33] <Yomamma1337> @andre11dr as op as chikage is, its somehow still weaker than hunter tool spam in an arcane build
[1:35:35] <peachy996> You got business first
[1:35:35] <Solidnick18> uh
[1:35:42] <+inktoxicant> SNUFF THE PUP
[1:35:44] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus blood bullets is an item fyi, demake will never tell you this
[1:35:45] <%brisk_dacat> She’s to busy been.. werid
[1:35:50] <+plsnolookatme> @parazoa42 The spells start dropping during the mid game tho
[1:35:52] <+inktoxicant> BREAK THE BORK
[1:35:56] <mrtanaka111> GET GOT
[1:35:56] <%SuspiciousWaffler> where does one download this version? ima bit late to the stream
[1:36:00] <Awesome_Leaf> bruh
[1:36:01] <+gwanzan> wtf was the knockback?
[1:36:04] <%elderpunch> @andre11dr im going chikage n evelyn build too lool
[1:36:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @SuspiciousWaffler itchio
[1:36:18] <Yomamma1337> @andre11dr also bloodtinge sucks early-mid, whereas arcane is great from the start
[1:36:23] <ShinyVagikarp> at least it's a key ring
[1:36:24] <+plsnolookatme> @parazoa42 Tiny Tonitrus, EX Glove, Phantasm Shell, all mid game items
[1:36:41] <+plsnolookatme> you get the good good at the end, sure, but Arcane spells aren't locked til the end game
[1:36:43] <otakon17> hey ITEM over there!
[1:36:48] <%TigerCatGo> BLUUUUUUUUDD
[1:36:49] <pennykettle_> @SuspiciousWaffler I cant link in chat but if you search Lilith Walker on twitter she has a link to an itchio or something
[1:36:50] <urkleturtle> blood and eyes
[1:36:51] <GeneralSCPatton> Did I see a chest in there?
[1:36:55] <Solidnick18> lots of blood
[1:36:56] <Boegame> blood might be important in the game guys
[1:36:57] <FassieFons> wuz dat smell?
[1:37:00] <%jinking79> Blood and Cheese
[1:37:01] <mrtanaka111> ITS BLOOD
[1:37:01] <%elderpunch> fear the old blood
[1:37:02] <$hattrick61> its bluuud
[1:37:03] <Renzaku69> Beware the Old Blood dear hunter....
[1:37:04] <rasamune> Yeah Bloodtinge is rough at first, but at the end you're just standing back and shooting the Daughter to death
[1:37:06] <otakon17> Take a shoot every time blood is mentioned
[1:37:07] <leith_aziz> We are made men by the blood
[1:37:08] <velgaduere> THE SWEET BLOOD
[1:37:10] <peachy996> Blood and Beast
[1:37:13] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk
[1:37:14] <Louie_Salmon> Lots of blood, possibly some Borne
[1:37:17] <otakon17> We are made beasts by the blood
[1:37:18] <pennykettle_> The Paleblood Hunt will be mandatory reading
[1:37:19] <velgaduere> just replace every noun with blood
[1:37:20] <%TigerCatGo> BLUD sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:37:21] <%brisk_dacat> What that sound…. It’s Blood!!
[1:37:23] <$hattrick61> its enough to make a man sick
[1:37:24] <mrtanaka111> grant us eyes
[1:37:25] <+Krasmeyts> The battle between Dark, The Darkness, and The Blood rages on.
[1:37:26] <Renzaku69> lol i mean its in the title
[1:37:28] <+Felhad> Smells like... blood
[1:37:34] <FassieFons> Blood: the Game ft. Eyes
[1:37:40] <Renzaku69> Reeking of blood
[1:37:41] <schufighters> mmm whats that smell?
[1:37:43] <Louie_Salmon> (!)
[1:37:47] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[1:37:49] <otakon17> The Tranfuser!
[1:37:52] <schufighters> oh the sweet blood, how it sings to me
[1:37:58] <thomasvalentine31> @schufighters IT'S BLOOOOOOOD!
[1:37:59] <CanonHusbando> This is your surgery room
[1:37:59] <leith_aziz> Yikes, Max missed this untill the end of teh playtrhough
[1:37:59] <Dakuu75> wait... did Max not find this on his playthrough? lol
[1:38:00] <%elderpunch> we are born of the blood
[1:38:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh wow its an ITEM??
[1:38:05] <otakon17> The smell...it's enough to make a man SICK.
[1:38:06] <%elderpunch> made men by the blood
[1:38:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ yeah, because movement is on d-pad
[1:38:12] <BlackermanZX> max missed this item the entire playtrough
[1:38:13] <otakon17> one more over
[1:38:13] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:38:14] <andre11dr> @schufighters It's enough to make a man sick
[1:38:14] <%elderpunch> undone by the blood
[1:38:18] <otakon17> yeah it is
[1:38:23] <%elderpunch> our eyes are yet to openn
[1:38:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil ohh
[1:38:30] <+Felhad> Bloods on the inside
[1:38:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> Honestly how the Hunter's turn their blood into bullets is never properly answered in the og
[1:38:36] <+gwanzan> I guess that is better than accidentally hurting yourself to make blood bullets you don't need, like have done so many times
[1:38:38] <SSScholar> We have Bloodborne for PC, now where's Bloodborne Kart ?
[1:38:41] <otakon17> get'chu some boolets!
[1:38:45] <CanonHusbando> The more basic utilities you use the less slots you have
[1:38:47] <+saltpiggu> triangle
[1:38:50] <otakon17> five boolet
[1:38:53] <Dakuu75> I like, that we have a 3d model to see, and not just a low-res image XD
[1:38:54] <slipdog> donate plasma
[1:38:55] <otakon17> and it's RALLY health to boot
[1:38:58] <CanonHusbando> Making your quick item load out part of your build
[1:38:59] <mrtanaka111> Bluud bullets
[1:39:04] <velgaduere> HUGE plus 5
[1:39:08] <Solidnick18> now you can shoot gun
[1:39:13] <otakon17> it uses THOSE five bullets first before it uses your actual amount
[1:39:14] <velgaduere> like 10% of the screen
[1:39:17] <mrtanaka111> blood of the blood blood
[1:39:19] <+saltpiggu> cause they're lost on death unlike regular bullets
[1:39:26] <Solidnick18> oh
[1:39:27] <Yomamma1337> theyre temporary bullets
[1:39:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:39:30] <Boegame> oh no sound foibles!
[1:39:32] <velgaduere> oh god it's on fire monkaS
[1:39:32] <@Menitta> need more blood
[1:39:32] <%LastHazzerd> sabatoge!
[1:39:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @Indigo_Automaton There's magical slugs, I think we're good on the lore of how the bullets work LUL
[1:39:37] <+superkeaton> Sound's locked
[1:39:37] <+saltpiggu> also you can go over cap with those

[1:42:28] <+inktoxicant> A match against the load screen lmao
[1:42:30] <bunnyscruff> It's better and it still sucks
[1:42:32] <+Dives__> 45 second loads are common for the launch version. It was shortened in a patch
[1:42:32] <+DatAsuna> bloodborne fighting game confirmed
[1:42:33] <andre11dr> You can do a whole HNK match
[1:42:37] <SoaringTrumpet> bathroom break loading screens

[1:43:02] <pennykettle_> @Lunalios stare at your ugly reflection in the black of the screen, bastard LUL
[1:43:03] <CanonHusbando> I liked the loading screen without item descriptions those had spoilers
[1:43:04] <MeImoth> its much better now
[1:43:05] <captain_elsewhere> day 1 like minutes long
[1:43:06] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> BB 1.0 loading screen used to be long as hell and just be a blank screen
[1:43:07] <@Menitta> also there were no loading tips
[1:43:07] <karawra> that would've been funny
[1:43:08] <scizor285> doesn't strive have bad loading?
[1:43:11] <Narratorway> Like, they fixed it, but yeah, it was almost a minute long when the game first came out.
[1:43:16] <+RigniGardenki> if u install it on a ps5 it's lickety split
[1:43:23] <pennykettle_> grandpa hat
[1:43:24] <+saltpiggu> strive has a server communication thats bad
[1:43:27] <gespenstkick> Tip
[1:43:29] <+plsnolookatme> @CanonHusbando 100%. You'd get Micolash's Cage on the first loading screen and you'd be spoiled for the whole damn game
[1:43:29] <+Dives__> Fashion
[1:43:29] <Yomamma1337> i see now why woolie wants to do his research before his lps
[1:43:32] <andre11dr> Remember on launch when the loading screen didn't even have the descriptions?
[1:43:34] <vingadivo> that draw distance tho
[1:43:36] <@Menitta> yeah strive, you can Speedrun Mario 64 during communication with server

[1:44:38] <%hax_metatron> No illusory walls, no mimics are my biggest complaint about Bloodborne. and NO the 2 illusory walls in chalices don't count
[1:44:39] <elshadow7> @WoolieVersus at some point later on, make sure to cycle through the graphic presets, they're awesome

[1:51:09] <%Theycallmenerf> Man Ludwig in this would be a cool fight to see
[1:51:10] <elshadow7> @OverzealousEuthanasiast I heard that too...
[1:51:11] <pennykettle_> I just got a notification that my doordash driver is being burned on a stake
[1:51:13] <+3d_pbandj> he should be talking over his coughing. it be more true to a Fromsoft game
[1:51:43] <+nochejunior> does the whole game happen in 1 night? or is it always nighttime?
[1:51:47] <andre11dr> Paarl would either be amazing or terrible looking in this type of art style
[1:52:03] <%Theycallmenerf> @pennykettle_ You gotta call HR and report that, the Healing church should reimburse you your coins
[1:52:07] <%hax_metatron> Woolie doesn't remember much of Bloodborne does he LUL
[1:52:08] <Yomamma1337> normall its already open, though?
[1:52:12] <pennykettle_> I think thats progression, usually you open it yourself
[1:52:12] <VidulaSaix> Jebaited
[1:52:18] <derrickslays> I hear the Gawk Gawk 3000 in the background
[1:52:21] <SaintSalted> i think bloodeborn is one night
[1:52:22] <Boegame> yeah, this is how it is in OG
[1:52:26] <Yomamma1337> woolie really doesnt remember bloodborne
[1:52:27] <CappuccinoGuil> The level design is slightly differnet
[1:52:27] <bunnyscruff> I think you got it reversed
[1:52:31] <+3d_pbandj> @andre11dr I would love to see Paarl destroying the FPS
[1:52:35] <buerdo> gate to the right doesn't usually exist

[1:53:20] <MadBaller123> There's a "we have bloodborne at home" meme waiting to happen...
[1:53:21] <andre11dr> Paarl and Laurence would make the game run at 10 fps LUL
[1:53:21] <Narratorway> Huntsman?  I would've said 'villager'.
[1:53:26] <Calamity2007> I like the bitcrushed voices

[1:55:08] <Xaeveax> @enerkaizer Yes and no.
[1:55:25] <andre11dr> @enerkaizer Not really, there's one bit but it's really short
[1:55:30] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> the fog darkness adds a new layer of bullshit too

[1:55:31] <CanonHusbando> Enough people are gonna be replaying bloodborne because of this that the pvp is gonna be pretty active
[1:55:35] <pennykettle_> @enerkaizer not in the style of plywood hell, but theres a small poison swamp
[1:55:36] <Tisaric> Bloodborne does have a swamp but it's not nearly as bad as blighttown
[1:55:37] <Yomamma1337> @enerkaizer yes, kinda
[1:55:37] <enerkaizer> @Xaeveax then I'm looking forward to how the demake is gonna handle that area
[1:55:40] <Bradthegas> Feels weird to see this running. Fun to watch though

[1:57:42] <Yomamma1337> aiming basically made it useless lol
[1:57:46] <andre11dr> Shit ,how the fuck would the Celestial Embassies work in this, wouldn't the fps go to hell?
[1:57:47] <OneGamer2EnvyThemAll> If this game actually came first and BB 2015 was a remake, how many folks do you think would trash it for 'not being 1:1' and 'taking liberties'?

[1:58:48] <%Lunalios> I love the arms when she's falling

[1:59:20] <Boegame> the Big Blind
[1:59:20] <%oneimportantthing> It's blowing my mind how cool it is to introduce Bloodborne to someone with this version
[1:59:23] <+superkeaton> Shit's super locked
[1:59:27] <Boegame> Got that blood over the eyes
[1:59:36] <%HeroToxiko> back then you just died past a kill wall if you fell, even if the fall wasn't far

[2:00:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Of course they'd blame the immigrant for all of this
[2:00:10] <Xaeveax> Nani
[2:00:18] <Dopamien> D: its all my fault
[2:00:21] <+superkeaton> @CappuccinoGuil Well, they are Victorian...
[2:00:26] <cheapdoc> POV you're in a racist town in texas
[2:00:29] <dashwallkick> you can get hit and parry at the same time, it sucks
[2:00:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil they are bri'ish
[2:00:33] <%HeroToxiko> PS2 frame's

[2:00:35] <andre11dr> "This sick game is corruption our children"-1996 Soccer Moms

[2:00:51] <+DACH33ZMAN> what fps does this game run at?
[2:00:57] <%HeroToxiko> woolieMIRIN
[2:00:58] <CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ I mean, that's why I said "of course they would"?
[2:01:06] <%elderpunch> @DACH33ZMAN beyond 60
[2:01:07] <CanonHusbando> The actual best feature of bloodborne is how rally extends after death so you’re incentivized to burn your whole stamina just wailing on a corpse
[2:01:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil yeah ik
[2:01:11] <+Prism_Zet> @DACH33ZMAN whatever you want, but 20 by default
[2:01:19] <+Nekros4442> @dach33zman looks like 20-25
[2:01:20] <pennykettle_> @DACH33ZMAN its locked at 20 by default but theres tons of settings. you can turn off the scanlines and stuff
[2:01:26] <TheMadDemoknight> "He said the Hunta is near!"
[2:01:36] <%jamsbybetty> I like how the framerate is more consistent than the ps4 version

[2:02:01] <cheapdoc> z fightin
[2:02:03] <+DACH33ZMAN> oh thats cool. Id imagine keeping default 20 would make parrying easier but would be cool for the classic feeling
[2:02:48] <dinnydanny777> Is the big guy to the left of the gate still here LUL

[2:05:50] <%AceNugget> Give the enemies a whiff
[2:05:51] <Basic_Birch_> Do stats matter in the demake lol
[2:05:56] <hellhound123123> @pandapeeps Yea hunters are enemies
[2:05:59] <peachy996> It's actually better looking than the real Sweaty Clothes in BB
[2:05:59] <Al_VII> Oh just you wait Reggie just you wait

[2:06:26] <dinnydanny777> @phistymcnutz56 LUL
[2:06:31] <%Indigo_Automaton> If you could smell any video game environment, Bloodborne's probably up there as the worst
[2:06:43] <peachy996> You look like Blondie from Good The Bad and The Ugly
[2:06:58] <%HeroToxiko> LuL
[2:06:59] <Supwizy> can you show how the game looks like without the filter @WoolieVersus
[2:07:01] <+Prism_Zet> @Indigo_Automaton I think there is like, two spots maybe i'd be okay with in bloodborne smells.
[2:07:05] <+DACH33ZMAN> it totally loads them thats wild
[2:07:07] <elshadow7> Good for vial farming though
[2:07:08] <CanonHusbando> If it smells anything like England it’s def the worst smelling
[2:07:09] <%HeroToxiko> LUL
[2:07:12] <+DACH33ZMAN> will make vial farming a lot easier lol
[2:07:14] <CappuccinoGuil> @hellhound123123 counter offer: glamour set

[2:07:26] <peachy996> they smell the sweat
[2:07:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton Hunter's dream is probably the best. Floral and candle scents
[2:07:30] <%HeroToxiko> Dem Boys
[2:07:35] <enerkaizer> a mob => 4 people
[2:07:48] <Kit_XIV_> Big damage
[2:07:52] <KaiserMario> @Indigo_Automaton Damp dog smell with fresh and dried blood, with a hint of incense everywhere
[2:07:56] <%HeroToxiko> Stick
[2:08:02] <+DACH33ZMAN> that was wonky lmao
[2:08:16] <gespenstkick> it happens every time
[2:08:16] <+Prism_Zet> @Indigo_Automaton the doll seems like she takes care of herself, and maybe the ocean with no rotting junk would be okay
[2:08:17] <elshadow7> That's what I meant by their animations being "wonky" sometimes
[2:08:23] <dinnydanny777> So many of the enemies in bloodborne have weirdly long arms
[2:08:24] <%HeroToxiko> he is wonky in. the game too
[2:08:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, I found just swinging to be faster
[2:08:32] <imNoggin> Honestly it replicates PS1 jank really well.
[2:08:42] <pennykettle_> @dinnydanny777 the doll's arms so so insanely long
[2:08:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Hoonta
[2:08:46] <+BigBruthaThunda> the dev make a video of local co op...did they add that to the release?
[2:08:47] <elshadow7> I got attacked several times by a dead enemy at one point xD

[2:09:24] <haitakaa> this is cool and all but part of me wishes they just made their own original game in this style
[2:09:25] <+Prism_Zet> @panlakes basically, one person wonder team
[2:09:28] <hellhound123123> @panlakes It's the first area up to father gascoigne
[2:09:33] <SQDizzy> the dev also made bloodborne kart for april fools
[2:09:38] <hellhound123123> It's not the entire game of Bloodborne lol

[2:10:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> you ever seen a goose's mouth?
[2:10:43] <+panlakes> their movements are so unnatural and unforeseen
[2:10:44] <+wynnewake> that bark is so much more horrifying when crunchy
[2:10:49] <ospreyworks> geese have teeth
[2:10:50] <%jonblnt> god i'm going to play this right after the stream
[2:10:50] <+saltpiggu> geese have teeth on their tounges

[2:11:56] <%jonblnt> @WoolieVersus how would you rate this compared to other non-From souls likes
[2:11:59] <enerkaizer> what a crunchy pebble
[2:12:03] <pennykettle_> I just looked at my phone after watching this for a while. The jump in framerate makes me feel weird

[2:12:15] <elshadow7> Quick! Start panicking!
[2:12:19] <%HeroToxiko> WE DEM BOIZ

[2:12:35] <+DACH33ZMAN> The dev really nailed the side step-slide
[2:12:43] <@Menitta> well you can't really compare something like this to Nioh 2 lol
[2:12:44] <DXLelouch24> @dach33zman youll find out, dunno where tho just know there in this somewhere.
[2:12:46] <%sporeian94> The true eldrich horror of having to spend a night in England
[2:12:57] <%oneimportantthing> This would have been a top 10 game of all time if it actually came out in the 90s
[2:12:57] <%LastHazzerd> @LastHazzerd true the camera. i'm thinking too limited to just the combat itself
[2:12:57] <hermitdab> ahhh slow

[2:16:04] <+saltpiggu> are there no lanterns?
[2:16:19] <GeneralSCPatton> @cappuccinoguil ymfah is the best for putting every video's soundtrack in a playlist
[2:16:33] <Klefth> Man, a megaman legends LP would be sick
[2:16:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @GeneralSCPatton he sure is, but honestly, I like listening to the videos for the SFX and jokes LUL

[2:17:13] <CappuccinoGuil> R2 and L2 while locked on
[2:17:15] <+Prism_Zet> after locked on tap trigger to cycle eenemies
[2:17:17] <+PMAvers> You use the camera control triggers.

[2:17:29] <peachy996> @DXLelouch24 It's easier to swing at them but yeah the parry works for them
[2:17:33] <+Prism_Zet> I thought reggie was playing this? lol
[2:17:34] <%hax_metatron> L2 R2
[2:17:43] <%elderpunch> @DXLelouch24 beasts werent usually parryable
[2:17:44] <CappuccinoGuil> @Detrius25 and it's fucking delicious
[2:17:51] <Detrius25> LUL
[2:17:54] <EnlouZalou> a whole pebble
[2:17:56] <EnlouZalou> poggers
[2:17:58] <elshadow7> @DXLelouch24 Easiest time to parry is when they start  that telegraphed lunge they do
[2:17:58] <+Prism_Zet> @DXLelouch24 beasts were totally always parryable
[2:17:58] <peachy996> They get stunned weird
[2:17:59] <+panlakes> just installed the game and I can't leave the main menu, the menu theme demake is too good
[2:18:01] <slipdog> they each have one hand on controller reggies doing movement
[2:18:05] <pennykettle_> Oh yea there's cheatcodes
[2:18:10] <@Solidus_113> that's not PS1
[2:18:15] <%Javaa01> R3 didn't exist, so you have to use a button combination
[2:18:16] <+Prism_Zet> @DXLelouch24 yep once they start to move forwards blam
[2:18:18] <+3d_pbandj> yea thats not a PS1 thing
[2:18:22] <Awesome_Leaf> they didnt have that back in the day
[2:18:23] <+saltpiggu> Big head mode?
[2:18:28] <OblivionSword1> button rebind on a PS1 game
[2:18:32] <@Solidus_113> you wanted some QoL???
[2:18:36] <@Solidus_113> psssshh
[2:18:37] <+DinnerCalzone> BBPSX does have a big head mode
[2:18:37] <OblivionSword1> that's not a fighting game
[2:18:38] <@Menitta> there better be a big head mode
[2:18:41] <peachy996> I'm loving these camera changes for the exits
[2:18:41] <BlackermanZX> change the death text to "BODIED"
[2:18:42] <@Menitta> YES
[2:18:43] <+DACH33ZMAN> thats a big short cut i think
[2:18:49] <CappuccinoGuil> QoL? On MY PSX game? The NERVE
[2:18:56] <+Reverend_Roscoe> that loading screen reminds me of Omega Boost
[2:18:56] <%bruuzer12> @menitta there totally is
[2:19:01] <elshadow7> Never got that insight huh?
[2:19:04] <%Javaa01> QoL? In current year -23?

[2:20:11] <CappuccinoGuil> You saw one before, remember
[2:20:18] <+Prism_Zet> there is a madman you can pickup pre boss
[2:20:32] <+Promessa_EX> just one shot cleric
[2:20:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, you saw a madman knowledge before in the alley
[2:20:44] <toulon_somberjade> You just need to get a madman's insight
[2:20:46] <+Prism_Zet> @Promessa_EX that's what I did lol very lucky
[2:20:55] <Boegame> time to go all the way around :V

[2:21:27] <king_shub> These are some very racist enemies
[2:21:29] <elshadow7> I got super lost when I played this
[2:21:45] <peachy996> I was just thinking you must be able to get a bunch of Blood Echoes by getting lost and backtracking like this
[2:21:48] <%X2Eliah> So where is the map button?
[2:22:03] <hellhound123123> lol map button in a souls game
[2:22:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> What was that ps1 with the zombie lions and you played as a guy with an axe?
[2:22:09] <+KAz_of_Fighters_98> Is it not 1:1 with the actual Yarnham map?
[2:22:19] <pennykettle_> No its moderately different
[2:22:20] <hellhound123123> @KAz_of_Fighters_98 no there's changes
[2:22:22] <+LittleCinders> Did stream start recently?
[2:22:23] <CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, for this demake, a map would be great
[2:22:24] <peachy996> There are some differences

[2:23:10] <%jonblnt> nice
[2:23:12] <CappuccinoGuil> The demake has fewer assets, so areas tend to blend more easily. Plus, not being able to look all over messes with navigation.
[2:23:16] <bunnyscruff> YOOO

[2:24:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Time to hit that bonfire
[2:24:16] <%oneimportantthing> The concept of insight is so cool but so underutilised if we're being real

[2:30:05] <+Prism_Zet> coldblood dew get that next level!
[2:30:10] <hellhound123123> Check your scaling
[2:30:14] <taeko_ohnuki> when I go to level up my character attacks while I navigate the menu, is that a common bug?
[2:30:23] <CanonHusbando> Gaskwang gatekeep girlboss
[2:30:26] <pennykettle_> @taeko_ohnuki are you in 1.02?
[2:30:29] <taeko_ohnuki> yea
[2:30:36] <slipdog> even just laying eyes on them changes you
[2:30:38] <%oneimportantthing> Lmao I'm having flashbacks to Pat yelling at Woolie for wanting to level up strength
[2:30:41] <+Prism_Zet> @taeko_ohnuki that sounds funky, maybe bad keybinds?
[2:30:43] <+saltpiggu> how far does this game go?
[2:30:47] <Dakuu75> I turned into an alley while walking home, and the moment I gained one insight, I ran in the other direction
[2:30:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:30:55] <hellhound123123> @saltpiggu Up to father gascoigne

[2:31:12] <+Timmaahh97> what is this?
[2:31:19] <%wolfofsound> wolfofsound subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Of all the beserk games, this one's my favorite.
[2:31:24] <Boegame> its to let you check how much you missing
[2:31:27] <+cdrom321> @oneimportantthing What was the reason for that again?
[2:31:36] <%wolfofsound> berserk* anyways
[2:31:46] <+BignanasTheGawd> feels so nostalgic
[2:32:04] <%oneimportantthing> @cdrom321 Pat called it an "intangible benefit" to level up strength and said Woolie didn't know how stats work lol
[2:32:13] <BaslerJones> pooborne
[2:32:13] <taeko_ohnuki> joe biden, wake up

[2:32:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the doll will have to do
[2:32:34] <T_Sasquatch> man the pc port on bloodborne is pretty budget
[2:32:47] <CanonHusbando> The doll rules desu
[2:32:49] <+BignanasTheGawd> Die Hunter, you dont belong in this world!
[2:33:01] <+vaderxyz1970> I don't think Maria is in this demo so the doll wins by default
[2:33:03] <pennykettle_> Woolie played these games in the weirdest order, now Reggie has to be introduced to BB in the weirdest and most unique way
[2:33:06] <%oneimportantthing> @t_sasquatch wait what do you mean this didn't come out in 1998 SwiftRage
[2:33:09] <kes009900> oh shit, where that hat came from
[2:33:17] <rasamune> @cdrom321 generally it's better to level END early on; then again you don't need to dodge dead enemies
[2:33:17] <+Prism_Zet> "pale fuckers" is kinda the problem in bloodborne
[2:33:19] <peachy996> There's more pale fuckers as the game progresses
[2:33:22] <Cherokia666> Yup, mania
[2:33:25] <peachy996> BB rather

[2:36:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie lost HP today
[2:37:00] <Dakuu75> I feel like that would've made weapon transformations cooler, in the real game. If you had to progress just a bit to unlock the feature
[2:37:00] <+Prism_Zet> could be select i guess lmao
[2:37:00] <%jonblnt> respect lost
[2:37:01] <pennykettle_> Reggie is in for a treat. Transformation attacks are the coolest thing this series has ever done
[2:37:01] <LadyAmatsu> @CanonHusbando The artist who worked on it released some tracks on their Youtube. Look up The Noble Demon. idk if I can post links here
[2:37:02] <+DACH33ZMAN> that makes kirk hammer way less cool
[2:37:02] <+parazoa42> Woolie, this game was made in 1997.

[2:37:05] <+AngelYoumou> I mean, they DID make the triggers into the Camera
[2:37:07] <FluorescentLB> treat it like this game is first woolz
[2:37:08] <KeiganOfAstora> It was kind of one of the selling points of the old gameplay
[2:37:08] <yukichocomilk> this is the ORIGINAL VERSION
[2:37:09] <%Gamefriendly> what if you swing, pause and then transform mid swing?
[2:37:09] <BlackermanZX> Psx'd
[2:37:12] <+Rafraud> AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE
[2:37:13] <%jonblnt> had to make cuts somewhere
[2:37:14] <%townzzzzz> what is this SF2 on sega bullshit
[2:37:18] <andre11dr> Wait so no transform attacks?
[2:37:21] <velgaduere> you can't expect 2015 modernization to be in a 1997 video game, Woolie
[2:37:23] <%TigerCatGo> @CanonHusbando AWESOME, THANK YOU
[2:37:25] <+setobox> it's 97 dude. this is cutting edge gameplay
[2:37:26] <+0neReeler> the rotate camera buttons were a mistake
[2:37:27] <+DinnerCalzone> You can do inter-combo transformations
[2:37:28] <%hax_metatron> Just play the remake man
[2:37:35] <pennykettle_> ITS SO FUCKING GOOD
[2:37:36] <slipdog> Stylish AF
[2:37:36] <%jonblnt> so good
[2:37:38] <hellhound123123> reggie about to nut
[2:37:38] <%LastHazzerd> Yeah, the remake really did add some great new features
[2:37:39] <andre11dr> The Clever has the most broken one too
[2:37:41] <+3d_pbandj> Transformation attacks sounds like some kinda fancy PS2 tech
[2:37:42] <+DACH33ZMAN> Reggie this game is so hype you dont even KNOW
[2:37:48] <%holydeviant1> This is making me want to hook up my PS4 again
[2:37:50] <T_Sasquatch> i almost never do it on my weapons LUL
[2:37:51] <Hydrapissed> they do poise damage to u can stun lock with it
[2:37:51] <cj_art> ooh reggie felt that
[2:37:53] <+Dives__> Man, Bloodborne kicks ass
[2:37:53] <slipdog> the game is 97% drip
[2:37:54] <KaiserMario> This game came out with FF7 Woolie
[2:37:55] <pennykettle_> All weapons are 2 in 1
[2:37:55] <peachy996> Cleaver has good Transformation Combos
[2:37:57] <%oneimportantthing> The remake really went leaps and bounds
[2:37:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:37:58] <+inktoxicant> the kirkhammer transform is so good dude
[2:37:59] <Dakuu75> Gonna go from THIS game, to the real bloodborne and think it's the remaster lol
[2:38:00] <%G_Thunders> I’m really glad they mapped transform to L1 in the 2015 remake
[2:38:00] <Hydrapissed> if u transform attack u can poise lock monsters its dope
[2:38:04] <%Namillus> This game is the tightest shit and Reggie is getting the weirdest intro to it
[2:38:07] <+0neReeler> kirkhammer Kreygasm
[2:38:08] <Rancaliber_> @dakuu75 To answer your question late, Woolie is on controls.
[2:38:14] <%jonblnt> god Bloodborne is great woolieGASM

[2:38:32] <Dakuu75> @Rancaliber_ Ah ok, thanks. Appreciate it.
[2:38:33] <%Bluwizard21> they increased this room so much
[2:38:34] <+Byr0nX> muh lawrence greatsword combos
[2:38:37] <andre11dr> The SPOILERS sword has the best transform attacks ,it's so cool
[2:38:39] <CanonHusbando> Nothing will ever beat the realization that comes with that first kirkhammer transformation
[2:38:40] <slipdog> @yukichocomilk that shit was cutting edge
[2:38:43] <hellhound123123> @peachy996 chikage would like a word, going from normal to blood mode and triplíng your damage in a swing
[2:38:44] <+Dives__> Ludwig's Holy Blade Kreygasm
[2:38:47] <pennykettle_> I want to live in this room
[2:38:51] <%oneimportantthing> I really hope Reggie goes into the og game knowing nothing about the graphics now
[2:38:53] <+commoncurium> Can you pause mid-hit and transform to do transformation attacks?
[2:38:55] <Hydrapissed> stake driver transform hits Clap
[2:39:03] <+Based_Moose> Woolie the PS1 can't handle the in game transformations
[2:39:05] <T_Sasquatch> Any unga bunga beast claw mains in chat
[2:39:05] <hellhound123123> stake driver charge tho
[2:39:09] <+inktoxicant> @dives__ A sword that transforms into a greatsword is just a mint idea
[2:39:15] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus I think there are only 3 weapons in the game
[2:39:16] <peachy996> @hellhound123123 yeah that's why I paused before typing and downgraded from great to good

[2:40:24] <tacostarvedbeast> Wow reggie already moving to a full blood borne lp, pog
[2:40:35] <+DACH33ZMAN> I wonder how chikage works with this pause system (if its even in the game)
[2:40:39] <%jepupu> Pocket Blood, not soulds
[2:40:47] <pennykettle_> The demake loads faster than the original
[2:40:53] <T_Sasquatch> @andre11dr ive only played transformed, they put the real beast mode in the dlc behind a damn boss sadly

[2:46:47] <andre11dr> Man i love that we keep finding uses for woolieCRAB after Dokapon
[2:46:48] <+parazoa42> It's really impressive.
[2:46:49] <%jinking79> waiting for Reggie to tell Woolie to try courage
[2:46:51] <Dr_Mooose> they are pretty cool indeed
[2:46:51] <%mr_sups> Video games are cool
[2:46:52] <+Stormiercashew> do you like beyblades?
[2:46:54] <+theoldone001> Reggie why do you always wanna attack the waifus?
[2:46:56] <%lilgarbage_> ands
[2:46:56] <%ekodrop> reggie when is the solo stream?
[2:46:56] <derrickslays> I can hear the Gawk Gawk 3000 in the background
[2:46:58] <%Orcapugs> Reggie put on Strive. He’s not looking.
[2:46:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Video games were a mistake, I can't wait to make more video games
[2:47:01] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus, Reggie just wanted to say you are cool and I like your presence in the WoolieVersus team very much
[2:47:03] <Boegame> Reggie the Body Snatcher :V
[2:47:04] <%arkv01> his smooth, sweaty hands
[2:47:05] <+Prism_Zet> What fighting games you playing lately
[2:47:06] <+panlakes> I'm having a lot of fun with it, it feels like I'm playing a demo in blockbuster at 11 years old
[2:47:07] <+DatAsuna> Woolie did it out of order too
[2:47:09] <+BeingTheVictor> random but Reggie love you on stream bro! at first I was hesitant but y'all make good stuff!
[2:47:13] <elshadow7> Can't be more out of order than Woolie's run
[2:47:13] <pennykettle_> Low poly is a great aesthetic. It needs a revival like pixel art got
[2:47:14] <andre11dr> Reggie why you gotta be so free in Strive?
[2:47:14] <wobbllob> who have been your strive mains reggie
[2:47:15] <VidulaSaix> Or is it? We never know LUL
[2:47:19] <tacostarvedbeast> They should put a bowling mode in here ala tekken
[2:47:21] <%Shad0wTag> SECRET STRIVE SESH LETS GOOOOO
[2:47:23] <cj_art> out of order is interesting to see, its fine
[2:47:27] <Yomamma1337> like half of what woolie said is wrong anyways so youre good
[2:47:27] <TheFramedWarlock> Lewd
[2:47:29] <%jonblnt> you wont remember a thing
[2:47:33] <Carlioo> did you already finish bloodborne psx?
[2:47:34] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> out of order is the best way. I did the same
[2:47:35] <%IGgy_IGsen> This one is quite different anyway.
[2:47:39] <+Rafraud> Reggie do you still follow smash stuff from the background
[2:47:42] <%LastHazzerd> gambling
[2:47:44] <slipdog> dangPogU
[2:47:48] <+Feralspirit41> Draedle, let it spin
[2:47:52] <pennykettle_> @WoolieVersus You cant possibly play these games in a weirder order than Woolie
[2:47:54] <leith_aziz> Wasnt there a Beyblade copycat that starts with B?
[2:47:56] <+DatAsuna> The ladder thing is real funny though, I remember leaving the same bug in one of the first games I made. lol
[2:47:59] <Rancaliber_> @carlioo No, bathroom break for right now.
[2:48:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Or a ring to make you do backflips Kappa
[2:48:03] <pokp0k> waddup Reggie! Planning on playing Elden Ring off stream?
[2:48:03] <%WutangchickeN> Tell us Reggie, did you let Minh win Dokapon?
[2:48:05] <%jonblnt> what demake would you want to play?
[2:48:07] <slipdog> @leith_aziz Bockugon brawlers
[2:48:07] <%elderpunch> @leith_aziz baukgan??
[2:48:12] <Carlioo> @Rancaliber_ oh good, was worried I missed it all
[2:48:12] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz There
[2:48:14] <+DatAsuna> it has to be 4
[2:48:14] <%adamisbarely3d> It'll be fun to come at Elden Ring fresher than most, since you're still playing through them all with Woolie the Sherpa around to make sure you don't miss anything
[2:48:14] <+Prism_Zet> I just moved to MTL, looking forward to non covid locals for fighting games
[2:48:15] <leith_aziz> Gotcha
[2:48:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Bro, DS2 is gonna take A WHILE
[2:48:19] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> quick tell us a secret about woolie!
[2:48:21] <peachy996> 12 years
[2:48:21] <tacostarvedbeast> That’s not fair he left carin alone
[2:48:21] <+Tucker0603> sorry if you guys already know but tap the triggers while locked on for target swap
[2:48:25] <+Grayhammatter> DS2 is gonna take a bit
[2:48:26] <peachy996> 22 years
[2:48:30] <pennykettle_> @Tucker0603 yea he got that
[2:48:31] <+Feralspirit41> Right not 2 years. It'll be 7 years
[2:48:35] <+Rafraud> FORTY YEARS
[2:48:36] <andre11dr> DS2 is long AF
[2:48:36] <+parazoa42> Do all the remaining Souls games at the same time
[2:48:38] <velgaduere> more frequently you say 👀
[2:48:38] <Djinnazz> soo, 9 months then?
[2:48:39] <slipdog> bounce that ass,  bounce that ass
[2:48:44] <%X2Eliah> just ds2
[2:48:47] <velgaduere> just one
[2:48:52] <oda_flobunaga> How about a God of War Demake, to make it a Ps2 game again
[2:48:52] <+DatAsuna> then you gotta play code vein xD
[2:48:53] <tacostarvedbeast> Is Reggie a Vergil or a Dante ?
[2:48:53] <+heloshindol> Why don’t you both play Elden Ring? Switch controller when somebody dies.
[2:48:53] <T_Sasquatch> 2022 is looking pretty thicc
[2:48:53] <WanderingYoren> ds1 - ds2 - bb - ds3
[2:48:54] <Yomamma1337> bloodborne came out before 3
[2:48:55] <@Menitta> No Bloodborne before 3
[2:48:56] <%Gamefriendly> no Sekiro?
[2:48:59] <%Irridium> Bloodborne was before Dark Souls 3
[2:48:59] <%jonblnt> don't tease Woolz  love Reggie Vs souls
[2:48:59] <+BigBruthaThunda> no bb is before ds3
[2:49:00] <%elderpunch> do the butt dunk
[2:49:04] <CappuccinoGuil> You COULD do release order
[2:49:05] <+TrevSmith222> Bloodborne came out before 3.
[2:49:05] <andre11dr> 3 is after BB
[2:49:07] <leith_aziz> Bloodborne 3?
[2:49:08] <TigerClaws12> play in release order, demons dark dark blood dark sekiro Keepo
[2:49:09] <+Prism_Zet> then sekiro, and king's field 1/2/3/4/5
[2:49:12] <peachy996> just a long sucky dark followed by  a decent dark
[2:49:12] <+MrCircleStrafe> yo bb!
[2:49:12] <+Rafraud> DARK BLOOD
[2:49:14] <KeiganOfAstora> 1 Bloodborne 2
[2:49:14] <%X2Eliah> Gameplay mechanics evolve
[2:49:15] <+Prism_Zet> tench 1/2/3
[2:49:15] <leith_aziz> Where's 2? D:
[2:49:15] <@Menitta> It really doesn't matter yeah
[2:49:17] <pennykettle_> demons dark dark blood dark shadow ring
[2:49:21] <Dakuu75> It legit doesn't matter
[2:49:21] <+Feralspirit41> Dark Dark Blood Dark Demons Ring Sekiro Beyblade
[2:49:22] <%Irridium> it's release order that's about it
[2:49:23] <+DatAsuna> Designwise you do see a lot of influence from BB in 3 yeah
[2:49:25] <VincentBrouillons> DS3 has a very bloodborne feel to it
[2:49:26] <+Prism_Zet> armored core 1/2/3/4
[2:49:29] <KaiserMario> BB is before DS3 for sure mechanically
[2:49:29] <KeiganOfAstora> Bloodborne before 3 no matter what
[2:49:29] <%Namillus> Sekiro doesn't count imo
[2:49:33] <leith_aziz> Dark Blood
[2:49:34] <@Menitta> people just hyped for Bloodborne lol
[2:49:36] <BoneofMalkav> Dark Dark Dork Dakka
[2:49:39] <garsedj> ds3 is just bloodborne fucking ds2
[2:49:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> BB is a different monster
[2:49:41] <+DatAsuna> And yeah just don't play sekiro lol
[2:49:43] <+Prism_Zet> and soem metal wolf chaos
[2:49:43] <KeiganOfAstora> Dark Blood Dark Dark
[2:49:45] <%X2Eliah> Demons, D1, D2, BB, D3, Seki, ER
[2:49:46] <+Grayhammatter> dark dark blood dark
[2:49:47] <andre11dr> DS3 Kinda assumes that you play Bloodborne, gameplay wise
[2:49:48] <MeImoth> machanically going Dark -> Blood -> Sekiro makes a lot of sense
[2:49:48] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> demon souls is the easiest tho
[2:49:49] <peachy996> I feel the only chronological is 1 and 3
[2:49:51] <+RigniGardenki> dark dark dark goose
[2:49:55] <turtlespence> Armored Core, Metal Wolf, Demon, 1,2,3,Blood
[2:49:56] <velgaduere> could do Bloodborne next tbh doodLewd
[2:50:00] <leith_aziz> Order is: Demon Souls, DS, DS2, BB, DS3, Sekiro?
[2:50:02] <T_Sasquatch> ds3 is just bloodborne but bad
[2:50:03] <haitakaa> don't forget about EVERGRACE
[2:50:03] <+Feralspirit41> Untitled Blood Dark
[2:50:07] <+DatAsuna> and then otogi :P
[2:50:11] <%arkv01> chrome souls
[2:50:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Hot Take, but doing Bloodborne before DS3 lessens the blow of how much DS3 changed the formula for the worst
[2:50:21] <%hukurowl> YEEAAAA
[2:50:26] <slipdog> and i'd say Thank you, god bless you
[2:50:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> YEAHHH
[2:50:29] <+BigBruthaThunda> the power is yours
[2:50:30] <ericbritsman> skip 2
[2:50:31] <+scarman125> yeah let's do Bloodborne next
[2:50:31] <andre11dr> That one obscure From horror game, THAT'S THE REAL START
[2:50:33] <BoneofMalkav> Untitled Blood Sequel Which Should Not Be Named LUL
[2:50:33] <%hukurowl> straight into Bloodborne PLS
[2:50:39] <Boegame> PLay them in order of speed of combat, so ds2, demons, dark souls 1, dark soul 3, bloodborne and sekiro :V
[2:50:39] <+MrCircleStrafe> we burning?
[2:50:39] <Qu1ckyyy> Woolie just wants to play Bloodborne again on his own
[2:50:42] <+BignanasTheGawd> play DS2 Twice
[2:50:43] <pennykettle_> I think DS3 first steals a bit of the show from BB, but I dont care, they can do whatever
[2:50:46] <%brisk_dacat> So wheres Sekerio
[2:50:46] <%X2Eliah> DS2 would still be fun tho
[2:50:47] <+TheScorpionEater> @CappuccinoGuil that is indeed a take to have
[2:50:48] <DXLelouch24> Yea after ER straight to BB
[2:50:48] <Awesome_Leaf> done for the day?
[2:50:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Skip 2 twice
[2:50:50] <DXLelouch24> Fuck it
[2:50:54] <+theoldone001> Is woolie still feeding you anti breakfast propaganda?
[2:50:56] <slipdog> you guys should do a whole BB co-op shenanigan
[2:50:58] <%livlinn> !uptime
[2:50:58] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 10 minutes
[2:50:59] <Cherokia666> Up to you
[2:51:01] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> anything's cool, just go with the flowy
[2:51:03] <%X2Eliah> Also, we need to wait until a PC remake comes out for BB
[2:51:06] <+BignanasTheGawd> skip 3 play 2 and then play 2 again
[2:51:07] <leith_aziz> If we're doing a marathon, might as well do them all
[2:51:09] <%jinking79> gettin used to dark speed compared to blood  speed takes a sec
[2:51:12] <andre11dr> DS2 at least has power stance so that's nice
[2:51:14] <turtlespence> skip 2 once and then play it twice
[2:51:14] <@Menitta> big head mode lesgooooo
[2:51:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @TheScorpionEater I like shields and big poise, sooo yes
[2:51:24] <Warfey> fuck yeah
[2:51:27] <+Prism_Zet> kenigs field 1/2/3/4, tenchu 1/2, metal wolf, ac 1/2, demons, tehnchu 3,  ac 3/4, dark 1/2, bb, ds 3, sekiro, elden ring
[2:51:28] <+rafaelba93> cool
[2:51:29] <%Namillus> Woolie and Reggie co-op split-streaming Bloodborne would be WILDIN'

[2:59:46] <CappuccinoGuil> YEYEYEY THE Z FIGHTING
[2:59:51] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus So when full Reggie Bloodborne lore-through?
[2:59:53] <KaiserMario> Disco months are top tier
[2:59:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus the best of vids were a good idea
[3:00:14] <oda_flobunaga> Why does this look better than the new Pokemon?
[3:00:18] <+Rafraud> Bloodborne is the only one I haven't played, should I play it real quick before elden or just play elden at this point lol
[3:00:23] <CappuccinoGuil> I wonder if the dev did research to make this thing look this accurate, how she went about it
[3:00:28] <+Prism_Zet> @oda_flobunaga cause skill and talent
[3:00:29] <+RigniGardenki> @oda_flobunaga because the creator gave a damn
[3:00:31] <%X2Eliah> @Rafraud well, you have time
[3:00:31] <rasamune> @Rafraud You should def play Bloodborne
[3:00:33] <KaiserMario> @oda_flobunaga LUL it does
[3:00:33] <+za7az> @Rafraud PLAY IT
[3:00:37] <Boegame> @oda_flobunaga cause Pokemon doesn't have to try :V
[3:00:47] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @oda_flobunaga worked within and used limitations to their advantage
[3:00:48] <+Rafraud> Aiiiiight lol
[3:01:14] <+Byr0nX> "Away! away"
[3:01:16] <+Prism_Zet> @Boegame I love pokemon and it frustrates me to no end as a 3D artist to see their games look like trash
[3:01:32] <CappuccinoGuil> @oda_flobunaga Because this is way smaller in scope, she worked hard to avoid crunching herself and cut tons of features out to keep it slim and focused.
[3:01:38] <pennykettle_> @Rafraud Bloodborne is FANTASTIC. You could definitely finish before Elden Ring, but so much of the lore is great to let sit in your head. So if you care about lore maybe give it some space and wait after Elden?
[3:02:17] <BlackermanZX> after this show reggie some Sunhilegend bloodborne gifs
[3:02:18] <Boegame> @Prism_Zet I like the concept of pokemon, but they look so bad, esp in the new one, it sucks
[3:02:26] <+Grayhammatter> lost in the sauce
[3:03:06] <rasamune> I think they're dead
[3:03:07] <%Feralspirit41> Feralspirit41 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Its good to see you playing this amazing work, I remember when I told a friend about it when I first found out we had a hard fight over whether or not you should even create de-makes of games. I still say I'm right and that sometimes it's cool
[3:03:08] <@Menitta> aw man the swoosh effect on the extended cleaver is so good
[3:03:23] <%holydeviant1> what a thrill~
[3:03:37] <%livlinn> LUL woolieCRAB
[3:03:37] <KaiserMario> i'm searching...
[3:03:46] <+Mictlan93> gotta let that upper area load in
[3:04:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> that little lens flare sprite on the lantern looks so good
[3:04:07] <%oneimportantthing> I'd give my liiife
[3:04:11] <%Feralspirit41> Whats the vial cap anyway
[3:04:14] <%oneimportantthing> Not for honor
[3:04:20] <Ipsenscastle> @Feralspirit41 i mean, what's the argument that you shouldn't do it? at worst it's not very good, but then who cares
[3:04:22] <pennykettle_> I think it was 20 in the original game
[3:04:26] <%RyTYoung> Chat has Woolie A-posed to the sky yet? Kappa
[3:04:26] <+Reverend_Roscoe> beast foul beast
[3:04:38] <mudox1717> blonde
[3:04:42] <peachy996> 20 in original yes
[3:04:47] <%Feralspirit41> @ipsenscastle the argument was basically "the game is fine as is why would you play a worse looking version"
[3:04:51] <%Namillus> Cap was 20 on you and then overflow into your storage capped at 999
[3:05:00] <Ipsenscastle> @Feralspirit41 oh, one of those LUL
[3:05:12] <KaiserMario> If only you had tank controls
[3:05:20] <+Prism_Zet> @Namillus after the update lol, i remember it being capped at waaaaay less
[3:05:21] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Oyohoyohoyoh
[3:05:27] <@Menitta> I bet when you reach cap here, the viles just don't go to storage
[3:05:29] <peachy996> You have to space your swings now that you have more range
[3:05:32] <%Feralspirit41> @ipsenscastle nah hes a chill guy things just got heated
[3:05:36] <@Menitta> as old games just forgot to count
[3:05:42] <%RyTYoung> Is there no lock on at all? gigaboOtsBani2
[3:05:43] <TigerClaws12> but it's cool tho
[3:05:48] <enerkaizer> Exacto knives are easy to draw. that#s why I think they look like this
[3:05:49] <Yomamma1337> its supposed to be a cleaver while transformed
[3:05:54] <%Namillus> There is in fact no storage box in the workshop lol
[3:05:56] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @rytyoung x button
[3:05:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @RyTYoung there is

[3:06:17] <%RyTYoung> @reverend_roscoe @cappuccinoguil tyty
[3:06:22] <rasamune> It's real easy to get lost down this hallway and I'm not being sarcastic
[3:06:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @rytyoung r2 and l2 swap lockons
[3:06:46] <+chiazam> I don’t remember these guys having voice lines in Bloodborne?
[3:06:52] <peachy996> I usually charge my heavy as the mob approaches
[3:06:55] <+Grayhammatter> they did
[3:06:56] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @chiazam they do
[3:07:01] <%Feralspirit41> They always did
[3:07:01] <%Namillus> These are the voice lines from Bloodborne with extra crust
[3:07:09] <Ipsenscastle> this feels so authentic
[3:07:10] <peachy996> But you seem more comfortable with short swings
[3:07:15] <%elderpunch> "woke mob" Kappa
[3:07:20] <+Grayhammatter> it's got that extra crust
[3:07:23] <%Feralspirit41> Now sprint up every ladder
[3:07:34] <+chiazam> I guess I can actually understand what they’re saying now
[3:07:34] <pennykettle_> yea lol this is the result of an anti mask mandate protest
[3:07:35] <+robertoszek> I'm so lost
[3:07:55] <+cdrom321> @chiazam They were the same as here, but their voice volume wasn't as dominating.
[3:07:56] <rasamune> @pennykettle_ Yoooou plague-ridden rat!! I'll mess up your brains!!!!!
[3:07:57] <Carlioo> christ those crows
[3:08:01] <+Byr0nX> BARK
[3:08:07] <WanderingYoren> accurate BB crows
[3:08:09] <gespenstkick> BIRD UP
[3:08:14] <%Feralspirit41> The crow sounds now really sound like barks
[3:08:15] <+Prism_Zet> those crows are my bane
[3:08:27] <+ramasit> Isn't mic volume extremely low compared to the game? Or is it just Crows?
[3:08:30] <%robosqueeb> christ this game is loud
[3:08:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> Blarghflgrbph
[3:08:33] <Carlioo> they showhow managed to make the crows worse
[3:08:40] <%clintlickr> woolieSPICE woolieYE
[3:08:42] <rasamune> That's just how loud the game is. Esp the crows
[3:08:43] <%adamisbarely3d> god, the crows sound so CRUNCHY
[3:08:47] <rasamune> It's true to the source material
[3:08:52] <+Prism_Zet> @ramasit crows are like twice as loud, woolie still leans in and peaks the mic a bunch and deafens me
[3:08:58] <%Feralspirit41> PsX games were either insanely loud or insanely quiet there was no inbetween
[3:09:20] <pennykettle_> I am super lost, I didnt think it would be this different
[3:09:20] <%Namillus> It's a fresh experience in a familiar setting, which is SICK
[3:09:28] <%Feralspirit41> The inbetween was dependant on how your tv sound was
[3:09:45] <TheAmazingNick> @Feralspirit41 TV speakers suck
[3:10:02] <+Prism_Zet> woolie hasn't hit the "house" yet right?
[3:10:03] <%Feralspirit41> @theamazingnick especially the old tvs you played your old games on as a kid
[3:10:09] <jmepik> crunchy bell
[3:10:10] <@Menitta> what do you mean you didn't have a sound bar in 1998
[3:10:24] <Lefteron> is there online?
[3:10:26] <WanderingYoren> psx invasions lets go
[3:10:35] <%Feralspirit41> Man when I was a kid we dead ass still had a tv that had knobs to adjust the color and sound and stuff
[3:10:36] <drunken_lemur> This has servers?
[3:10:44] <pennykettle_> BB invasions sounded so cool prerelease
[3:10:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Would you like to expose yourself to Remote Code Execution?
[3:10:46] <gespenstkick> @Lefteron LUL
[3:10:47] <Ipsenscastle> honestly I still use tv speakers, I've never really felt like I needed speakers or a soundbar
[3:10:49] <velgaduere> abandon your remake knowledge
[3:11:01] <+Prism_Zet> @Feralspirit41 my first tv was like that, with sound inputs with wires and screws and stuff for cable
[3:11:27] <VidulaSaix> You can
[3:11:31] <+Grayhammatter> you can
[3:11:37] <VidulaSaix> You should try the Remastered setting just to see the differenc

[3:11:44] <%Feralspirit41> I love these textures on the walls
[3:11:44] <majindusto> But Why tho?
[3:11:45] <TheAmazingNick> if you want the real fake experience, you keep it on
[3:11:50] <%Feralspirit41> theyre all off center
[3:12:01] <majindusto> lol
[3:12:04] <+CAPSLOCKlive> This really feels like a decent split between PS1 and Fake-PS1 look
[3:12:11] <+robertoszek> yeah, you should try the Remastered setting at least once
[3:12:12] <+Prism_Zet> woolie forgor the positions
[3:12:13] <%oneimportantthing> I played the OG like 8 times and feel totally lost here
[3:12:32] <ken_kuma> This looks fucking astonishing
[3:12:40] <pennykettle_> @oneimportantthing ive only played once but I have the layout memorized anyways, but same here
[3:12:41] <WanderingYoren> this is the main street to the burning town center I think
[3:12:43] <%Feralspirit41> I will admit its super disorienting to see the game from this camera position though
[3:12:55] <+Prism_Zet> @oneimportantthing its like 60% accurate layouts roughly the same with some changes in the corners and stuff
[3:13:07] <+Grayhammatter> the town center monkaS
[3:13:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:13:17] <%Feralspirit41> Like how its directly behind the character and not slightly back and above
[3:13:48] <+CAPSLOCKlive> You have Horizontal camera control but not vertical, right?
[3:14:00] <+Laycas49> @CAPSLOCKlive L@ R@
[3:14:05] <+Laycas49> L2 R2*
[3:14:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> You don't wanna stop for the night in Yharnam
[3:14:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> just keep driving
[3:14:13] <+cdrom321> @capslocklive Correct. Shoulder buttons only.
[3:14:16] <VincentGraves> that framerate
[3:14:27] <kinkade_77> was texture wobble this bad in ps1 games or is this a bit extreme
[3:14:29] <%Feralspirit41> But gas prices in yharnam are super low
[3:14:30] <pennykettle_> Hypothetically the dev could have added a super high poly great one in here to amp up the surrealness
[3:14:38] <+Prism_Zet> "things to do in Yarnham LEAVE"
[3:14:38] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Is this the full game??
[3:14:41] <$lumporr> a single fruity pebble
[3:14:43] <AstrodropGaming> The framerate shitting itself accurately
[3:14:45] <%jamsbybetty> @kinkade_77 dude it was WORSE
[3:14:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Feralspirit41 it's not worth it
[3:14:49] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Nah as far as Texture warping this is very spot on for Ps1 style
[3:14:52] <%SlimmieP> Oh yeah those frames calebGasm
[3:14:53] <+kraajkase> @kinkade_77 it was even worse in some cases
[3:14:55] <+Laycas49> @counterfeitgimmicks Goes up to father gascione
[3:14:58] <%Feralspirit41> @reallybigrocks 50 cents a gallon tho
[3:15:01] <WanderingYoren> doesnt charge heavy beat the shield?
[3:15:02] <+Byr0nX> THIEF
[3:15:16] <+Grayhammatter> triple kill
[3:15:18] <+Prism_Zet> charge heavy beats a lot
[3:15:20] <squirtkitten> @pennykettle_ s a disjointed polygon amygdala hanging off a building WutFace
[3:15:25] <+CAPSLOCKlive> the lower camera angle does make it a bit harder to judge attack distances it seems
[3:15:28] <+robertoszek> is woolie gonna try to use heal with the molotov, bets are open
[3:15:28] <%Feralspirit41> Circle strafe in all the wrong ways

[3:16:30] <TheAmazingNick> I love how this is reggie's first Bloodborne experience.
[3:16:39] <pennykettle_> its funny when you think about how the real bloodborne only gets +10 fps
[3:16:40] <%jamsbybetty> yo do we got BRICK TROLL in this??
[3:16:40] <+Collieburr> Woolie uses Blunderbuss. It's not very effective.
[3:17:05] <+Prism_Zet> @jamsbybetty indeedy

[3:17:50] <mudox1717> yeah +10 lol. if only the original had 60fps.
[3:17:50] <pennykettle_> sigma males just pop all coldblood dew without concern for the amount it gives
[3:18:05] <xerotwo> So cold blood dew 3 is baja blast? LUL
[3:18:10] <%Feralspirit41> I like how locking on tells you the name of the enemy

[3:19:52] <RadioSpirit> I had a nightmare thought of this game with Jet Set Radio movement
[3:20:03] <+RingingTheBellsOfZetta> Is this training for Reggie vs. Bloodborne?

[3:20:52] <TigerClaws12> oh no the respawn LUL
[3:21:02] <%Feralspirit41> @pennykettle_ youd launch yourself off the map every 5 minutes lol
[3:21:11] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is gonna be so salty when he plays the og Bloodborne and sees that it runs worse than this
[3:21:11] <+thegonzo1> @counterfeitgimmicks no, its not a ps1 game
[3:21:25] <+CAPSLOCKlive> The extra echoes is not bad. That's already an extra level or two there
[3:21:26] <peeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee> @counterfeitgimmicks it only looks like a ps1 game

[3:22:42] <yukichocomilk> 4Head
[3:22:42] <+eanscrale> if this was an actual fromsoft game from the ps1 it would be in first person and a skeleton would pop up and kill you from the first chest you opened
[3:22:43] <dukenux> alone on the night of hunt? pathetic
[3:22:45] <%Irridium> all alone on a friday night
[3:22:45] <+Byr0nX> look at this fool outside
[3:22:45] <+Grayhammatter> she do be hysterical
[3:22:45] <xerotwo> OHOHOHOHOHOHOHO
[3:22:47] <Dr_Mooose> ohohoho
[3:22:50] <%Feralspirit41> *ba dum tss*
[3:22:59] <+Prism_Zet> woolie look around the door
[3:23:02] <andre11dr> They straight ballin
[3:23:28] <%Feralspirit41> They also love poison swamps
[3:23:39] <T_Sasquatch> Elden ring has real darkness
[3:23:39] <rasamune> @eanscrale If you didn't just die from the ground opening up beneath you in the first ten seconds of the game
[3:23:39] <+Grayhammatter> he LOVES poison swamps
[3:23:42] <TheMadDemoknight> I wonder if in orgies blood is involved in Yharnam. WutFace
[3:23:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe Elden Ring will do it well, but also useful
[3:23:46] <+Prism_Zet> @Feralspirit41 SO many poison swamps
[3:23:48] <+CAPSLOCKlive> The creators of Nightmare Creatures went Bankrupt on 2002, nobody bought the company. So... is that IP just open for grabs?
[3:23:51] <@Solidus_113> there are flame butterflies
[3:23:54] <pennykettle_> Cool idea but lighting system ruined
[3:23:55] <@Solidus_113> also the torch time stacks
[3:24:08] <DeathByPoke7> we need power stanced torches
[3:24:08] <yukichocomilk> ds2 is not a shit game Kappa
[3:24:12] <andre11dr> and the lightning didn't work properly so the torch was useless LUL
[3:24:13] <Enyoyable> You have like an hour and a half worth of torch by default it's fine.
[3:24:14] <+BigBruthaThunda> they give u plenty, thankfully
[3:24:16] <TigerClaws12> the torch time is the total time from your stack no? LUL
[3:24:18] <T_Sasquatch> eh ds2 has no lighting LUL
[3:24:26] <peachy996> In this game you can buy a lamp
[3:24:27] <WanderingYoren> didn't really need the torch in ds2, cause the lighting system was scrapped
[3:24:28] <%Feralspirit41> I bet the first elden ring dlc is gonna be a new map thats just a poison swamp
[3:24:29] <%MajorCrasher> I finished DS2 with like 5 hours worth of torch, it's not that bad
[3:24:37] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Nice light effect
[3:24:45] <peachy996> So you don't even need the torch eventually
[3:24:45] <Lefteron> you can also find braziers to light torches or use a flame buterfly.
[3:25:01] <%HeroToxiko> vanilla souls 2 WutFace
[3:25:09] <pennykettle_> SourPls
[3:25:11] <VidulaSaix> SourPls
[3:25:12] <T_Sasquatch> If i recall. someone actually added the lighting back to ds2 and it looks great
[3:25:14] <%Feralspirit41> Uh
[3:25:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> heh
[3:25:15] <swift_malachi> Oh are there not infinite torches in DS2? I always wondered about that system, but couldn't finish the game
[3:25:15] <peachy996> Ohhhh yeah

[3:25:42] <pennykettle_> torch maybe? IDK
[3:25:42] <%parazoa42> Insight gained
[3:25:45] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Insight go UP
[3:25:46] <AppleBerryKitty> lytJIVE
[3:25:47] <WoawDesu> Insight
[3:25:48] <+thegonzo1> @CAPSLOCKlive probably some law firm or holding company owns the IP, there's no legal mechanism for making IP public domain early
[3:25:48] <BlackermanZX> good ol' psx jitter
[3:25:54] <andre11dr> It goes into a trap remix LUL
[3:25:57] <+Fetrigon> INSIGHT 🧿
[3:26:00] <+Prism_Zet> later woolue
[3:26:02] <KasiCrafter> That's a PS1 fakery thing. It can be turned off if you dont like the warping
[3:26:06] <%Feralspirit41> Time to play "is this a bug"
[3:26:09] <+Grayhammatter> maybe you need more insight?
[3:26:14] <KaiserMario> PSX shake
[3:26:15] <+b0yr0br0y> that's just on purpose ps1 gittery textures
[3:26:15] <velgaduere> this tune normally plays here, just to jog some memories
[3:26:15] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:26:16] <+Adalore> yeah it stands out in terms of jitter.
[3:26:16] <%X2Eliah> this looks like a secret
[3:26:17] <@Solidus_113> no that's just ps1
[3:26:20] <+DinnerCalzone> YO SECRET?
[3:26:24] <Nogopharo> The box is in it's normal place
[3:26:25] <+sermittens> wrong spot
[3:26:30] <+Prism_Zet> check round the old hag door
[3:26:32] <rasamune> It's just tech shit Woolie
[3:26:36] <+CAPSLOCKlive> "The Wall is Jelly" is the bloodborner version of the Floor is Lava
[3:26:38] <%SlimmieP> Buggy texture with no collision
[3:26:44] <+sermittens> it's at a window
[3:26:51] <%SlimmieP> Jk iono
[3:26:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Eventually Woolie stopped thinking
[3:26:57] <peachy996> Just go out and hunt a few beasts Woolie
[3:27:14] <rasamune> Was that lever there in the original?
[3:27:17] <QueequegTheater> SourPls
[3:27:18] <rasamune> I forget
[3:27:22] <hellhound123123> @rasamune No
[3:27:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:27:25] <%Feralspirit41> it wasnt
[3:27:27] <rasamune> Yeah I didn't think so
[3:27:28] <CappuccinoGuil> the wall likes to undulate
[3:27:29] <+Grayhammatter> oh, i guess it's just textures LUL
[3:27:30] <Nogopharo> No that lever wasnt there
[3:27:31] <peachy996> I like this demake version of the tune
[3:27:38] <%Collieburr> Fear the old masonry, by the gods fear it...
[3:27:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> Spooky
[3:27:39] <@Solidus_113> you can turn off that jitter in the settings
[3:27:40] <megaman_sentinel> music box ?
[3:27:41] <VidulaSaix> @peachy996 Its the same as the OG
[3:27:42] <+Prism_Zet> woolie check around the old hag door
[3:27:43] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That is just the effect of emulating Ps1 texture warping on purpose
[3:27:48] <BlackermanZX> nah its literal psx jitter
[3:27:55] <+theoldone001> That's the PS1 texture jitter
[3:28:05] <QueequegTheater> Sadge

[3:28:54] <Nogopharo> I cannot wait until Reggie plays Bloodborne
[3:28:54] <+Grayhammatter> bjork
[3:29:04] <mudox1717> the dogs in this demake are more annoying than the original.
[3:29:05] <rasamune> Suffer not a pupper to live. Bust all borks
[3:29:23] <%X2Eliah> borkbusters 2016
[3:29:28] <hellhound123123> Can't wait to see Reggie's reaction when the horror starts shifting
[3:29:34] <%Feralspirit41> Bork Busted
[3:29:34] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Is there no Level up on this version? Woolie is swimming in Echoes for this early in the original
[3:29:40] <+Reverend_Roscoe> it's a little upsetting
[3:29:40] <+Adalore> the true blood, the furry blood.
[3:29:41] <andre11dr> Bloodborne has those fucked up dogs with the blades coming out of them too
[3:29:43] <jorniev> pig blood
[3:29:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> what's a blood type?
[3:29:44] <QueequegTheater> @hellhound123123 Demake is just up to Gaskwang
[3:29:49] <hellhound123123> Yeah there's level up, he just hasn't gone back to the dream
[3:29:53] <jorniev> cloned blood
[3:29:56] <%Feralspirit41> @capslocklive there is he just hasnt been back to the dream in a while
[3:29:56] <peachy996> Speaking of, How is the guy with the pig heart transplant? Is he still doing okay?
[3:29:57] <rasamune> @CAPSLOCKlive There's level up, he's just playing risky
[3:29:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's just blood
[3:30:03] <+Prism_Zet> @andre11dr somebody stuck those there though haha, they're like strapped in
[3:30:03] <@Solidus_113> old blood
[3:30:12] <+BigBruthaThunda> get this blood out of my bloodborne
[3:30:12] <gespenstkick> blood is blood is blood
[3:30:13] <DancesWitBalrog> I forgot about "Gaskwank"
[3:30:15] <jorniev> YOUNG BLOOD
[3:30:16] <%X2Eliah> Seems like there should be more insight to get
[3:30:30] <hellhound123123> @hellhound123123 Yeah I know, I meant when he gets to og bloodborne
[3:30:31] <+Prism_Zet> there's another path for later by the old lady door
[3:30:32] <oglogyy> Does Reggie know much about bloodborne?
[3:30:36] <+Fetrigon> oh I thought he was going for a racism joke LUL
[3:30:39] <+CAPSLOCKlive> that was a smart Zone split there
[3:30:47] <Nogopharo> Reggie knows nothing Im pretty sure
[3:30:54] <andre11dr> Also let's not forget the crow dogs
[3:30:58] <hellhound123123> @oglogyy Seems like he knows nothing really other than what woolie's told him
[3:31:13] <%Feralspirit41> I imagine the short cut porn isnt as intense in this game since the zones are split like this
[3:31:25] <%mr_sups> Get ready for SKREEEE
[3:31:26] <%X2Eliah> well

[3:32:21] <DancesWitBalrog> @Feralspirit41 there are lots of shortcut porn, then the dev uses that to do something awesome. wont spoil it
[3:32:21] <andre11dr> There was a shotgun button here, it's gone now
[3:32:23] <+Prism_Zet> @Feralspirit41 there are MORE shortcuts than in this area actually haha if you coune fences and stuff

[3:33:09] <%Feralspirit41> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:33:17] <+CAPSLOCKlive> at least getting Wolf'd at the Bridge makes sense early on
[3:33:51] <+Hydraiguess> its pretty much the same map as normal bloodborne or nah?
[3:34:06] <@Solidus_113> not quite
[3:34:16] <peachy996> Very similar Map but with some slight differences
[3:34:17] <Nogopharo> They changed a good amount of it
[3:34:32] <Nogopharo> by adding new areas
[3:34:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:34:34] <+Prism_Zet> i'd call it  like 60% the same
[3:34:36] <andre11dr> Damn that shield dude was wilding
[3:34:42] <peachy996> Backstabs no, Parries yes
[3:34:53] <+CAPSLOCKlive> this version of the map is more like "what you remember the map to be"
[3:34:59] <+S3xGAZEBO> enemy hunters can visceral attack you
[3:35:16] <%Feralspirit41> the dead silence is a really good touch
[3:35:27] <%Feralspirit41> original game you had ambient noise
[3:35:32] <Rolandknight> who's playing again?
[3:35:37] <+Prism_Zet> woolie
[3:35:50] <peeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee> i hear ambience lol
[3:35:57] <%Feralspirit41> I dont

[3:36:03] <+Reverend_Roscoe> awl mess up yoah bwains
[3:36:05] <Renzaku69> i dont know how i never caught that
[3:36:07] <%Feralspirit41> I hear footsteps and dead quiet
[3:36:16] <QueequegTheater> OWL MUSS UP YER BRAENS
[3:36:18] <DancesWitBalrog> @Rolandknight the guy who said gaskwank
[3:36:25] <+CAPSLOCKlive> the first second of the guy screaming at you in this version sounds a bit Homer Simpson
[3:36:30] <%Namillus> Staircase
[3:36:37] <peeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee> theres definitely ambience, wind sounds and small noises
[3:36:41] <+alekto989_m31> How much of the game did the devs recreate chat?
[3:36:47] <%Feralspirit41> alot
[3:36:55] <+alekto989_m31> That's honestly amazing
[3:36:56] <KasiCrafter> Not the whole game, obv
[3:37:00] <Ids560> up to gaskwang
[3:37:02] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:37:04] <%X2Eliah> good point

[3:37:17] <+Grayhammatter> they'll prolly be on a wolf
[3:37:19] <+alekto989_m31> I hope so. This is really neaty
[3:37:23] <AstrodropGaming> LUL LUL
[3:37:27] <+CAPSLOCKlive> on original Ps1 they would probably De-spawn, but on this it's probably tracked
[3:37:29] <galko_chan1> LUL never forget gaskwang
[3:37:30] <BlackermanZX> its on the wolf
[3:37:30] <+Prism_Zet> corpse run is a thing,
[3:37:31] <%HeroToxiko> and the "eyes" have it LUL
[3:37:31] <%Feralspirit41> Do souls actually drop like the original or have the devs gone "nah"
[3:37:33] <squirtkitten> @alekto989_m31 gascoigne, cleric beast and a new boss
[3:37:36] <Electrichobo> corpse run is a thing
[3:37:55] <%Feralspirit41> I honestly wouldnt mind if they removed corpse run
[3:37:55] <+Prism_Zet> @Feralspirit41 they do, but enemies can take em in
[3:37:56] <+Grayhammatter> wow, bugged that guy out
[3:37:57] <DancesWitBalrog> the shield huntman is tanky in this game
[3:37:58] <sirrice77> @alekto989_m31 up to gaskwang, though they added a new boss and areas that aren't in the original. Still mostly just the first area though
[3:38:00] <WanderingYoren> i have to imagine dying out of world was the exception
[3:38:04] <%elderpunch> LUL
[3:38:06] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Snuff the Pupper
[3:38:10] <Electrichobo> PS1 pathing
[3:38:11] <peanutdot007> Yo Bloodborne on PC?
[3:38:14] <rasamune> cool pathfinding doggo
[3:38:16] <+tomdwarf> I think its bugged, like you succeed on the riposte, and he just resets his position.
[3:38:17] <+GilroyGoldBlood> monkaS
[3:38:21] <graemecrackers2> wait can the weapon not transform ?
[3:38:29] <rasamune> It's in the menu
[3:38:29] <+Grayhammatter> don't get bork busted
[3:38:31] <%X2Eliah> @graemecrackers2 pause
[3:38:32] <+Prism_Zet> @graemecrackers2 pause menu transfrom lol
[3:38:44] <Gelphaze> That was almost bad!
[3:38:48] <mudox1717> you (must) abandon all past muscle memory.
[3:39:00] <%Feralspirit41> Now will he get the souls
[3:39:03] <Nogopharo> Werewolf has the souls Kappa
[3:39:07] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Soul is in the big bad wolf
[3:39:13] <%Feralspirit41> In b4
[3:39:14] <QueequegTheater> Having almost the same moves is honestly worse than no muscle memory at all
[3:39:14] <Electrichobo> got one for y
[3:39:19] <+S3xGAZEBO> or if enemies can still pick up your blood echos
[3:39:22] <DancesWitBalrog> there are still some bloodborne  frame data that exist in this game
[3:39:22] <Nogopharo> Sorry they're echoes
[3:39:28] <Electrichobo> Got one for you, jump and climb a ladder
[3:39:29] <QueequegTheater> I can't even count how many vials I lost trying to transform my weapon
[3:39:29] <+CAPSLOCKlive> 4k souls on the line, lets see how this plays out
[3:39:32] <%Feralspirit41> Blood souls
[3:39:36] <%crybirb> The big wolfes in the bridge gave me more trouble in the original game than Father Gascoigne
[3:39:48] <mudox1717> cool it corrects that.
[3:40:10] <+Grayhammatter> theyre just like fire bombs
[3:40:16] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb same here lol, the two at once just ALWAYS wombo combo'd me
[3:40:18] <peachy996> At least you're not getting both
[3:40:50] <%CodenameChaz> Nice amount of echos
[3:41:00] <Cobaltor_252> oh this is new
[3:41:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> heh
[3:41:03] <%crybirb> Is the clothe equipment still in that fall?
[3:41:04] <DancesWitBalrog> i didnt have trouble with them. just fish and parry the werewolves when they do the delayed lunge. very easy @crybirb
[3:41:10] <%Feralspirit41> New doors
[3:41:14] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus hole is new zone fyi
[3:41:14] <+CAPSLOCKlive> that hole is in the original
[3:41:25] <%Feralspirit41> Is it?
[3:41:28] <+CAPSLOCKlive> isn't that hole that leands to the dogs in cages?
[3:41:30] <VidulaSaix> Its not
[3:41:31] <%crybirb> @DancesWitBalrog, after a couple of playthroughs yeah, but on your first? It was way more hard than Gascoigne for me.
[3:41:37] <%Feralspirit41> I didnt think so
[3:41:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:41:44] <%Feralspirit41> Ive never seen that hole in my life

[3:41:57] <QueequegTheater> @Feralspirit41 That's what I told my wife
[3:42:00] <QueequegTheater> heyo
[3:42:01] <%crybirb> I think that hole is where you would fall to grab the hunters garb.
[3:42:10] <%Feralspirit41> Damn Queequeg
[3:42:16] <+Grayhammatter> oh that's dark
[3:42:21] <%crybirb> Because in this game it needs screen transitions, so they did a transition for that fall

[3:43:06] <T_Sasquatch> AWAY AWAY
[3:43:08] <+Prism_Zet> in the same place gun grampa always is
[3:43:16] <mudox1717> eating an orange.
[3:43:18] <+Prism_Zet> doing dumb gun grampa stuff
[3:43:26] <%Feralspirit41> Grandpa sitting there waiting to hear about mask mandates
[3:43:27] <%crybirb> goddamn everyone remembers this part, burned in the memory
[3:43:41] <T_Sasquatch> Man i farmed those dumb werewolves for bloovials when i was hard stuck on gaskwang
[3:43:45] <pennykettle_> LUL glowing
[3:43:49] <DancesWitBalrog> i love the rally system
[3:43:49] <KalmVibrations> Good ol' farming spot
[3:43:50] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Asshole Gun Grandpa thought a lot of lessons to newcomers to souls
[3:43:50] <VidulaSaix> GUN GRANDPA
[3:43:52] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:43:54] <BlackermanZX> there he is LUL
[3:43:56] <+Grayhammatter> that glowing man in the wheelchair
[3:43:58] <+Dives__> Wheelchair man is not to be underestimated
[3:43:59] <%Feralspirit41> They knew about gun grandpa
[3:44:02] <pennykettle_> didnt give him a chance to shine
[3:44:02] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> disrespect the corpse for more time on the clock
[3:44:07] <Nogopharo> Reggie's face is like how the fuck can you tell he's in a wheelchair
[3:44:13] <%crybirb> Does this old fellow has just a gun with bombs or he has the chaingun?
[3:44:22] <%Feralspirit41> Chaingun
[3:44:24] <Cobaltor_252> is it though
[3:44:30] <%crybirb> I don't remember his weapon, I remember the boom room where he kamikazes
[3:44:30] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Reggie vs Bloodborne is gonna be a good time
[3:44:34] <%Namillus> Chaingun is later I think?
[3:44:36] <rasamune> Who wrote this and why
[3:44:37] <DancesWitBalrog> yah, the healing church are a bunch of shitbags
[3:44:39] <+Grayhammatter> i thought he just had a gun
[3:44:42] <%crybirb> Chaingun is way later, I think he only has a pistol
[3:44:52] <peachy996> Wheelchair men have all sorts of weapons
[3:44:53] <%Feralspirit41> Im like 70% sure its a chaingun
[3:44:57] <squirtkitten> he has the really big cannon pistol unique to that enemy
[3:45:01] <VidulaSaix> New level!
[3:45:01] <QueequegTheater> @CAPSLOCKlive Given how much he liked facetanking in DeS and DS I'm pretty sure he's gonna kick BB's ass

[3:47:05] <+CAPSLOCKlive> 5k Echoes in the pocket, Woolie rolling deep down Yarhnam
[3:47:08] <rasamune> Now go spend your soooooouuuuuls
[3:47:12] <+3d_pbandj> turn in those souls!

[3:47:37] <gespenstkick> It's the same, just not the same
[3:47:43] <mudox1717> window guy is the homie.
[3:47:43] <+Prism_Zet> no woolie, its a ZONE
[3:47:44] <%parazoa42> *clock lol

[3:47:57] <VJdarkworld> @parazoa42 YEP COCK tower
[3:48:00] <Carlioo> wuuuuuugh
[3:48:10] <%Feralspirit41> Is it possible to kill the doll?
[3:48:20] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Damn dude if a PS1 game came out in the day with THIS soundtrack, it would be beyond nuts
[3:48:21] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> that scream is great cause it makes me want to scream
[3:48:24] <T_Sasquatch> is it weird that i think bloodborne should be scary but i dont find it scary at all
[3:48:26] <Cobaltor_252> @WoolieVersus don't save when the doll's inside, apparently there's a bug that puts you in a death loop on load
[3:48:29] <pennykettle_> afaik if you kill the doll she just comes back
[3:48:50] <T_Sasquatch> it has all the aesthetic to be terrifyinng but im like lol , beast claw go brr
[3:48:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[3:48:54] <+swesterly> are we fully confident we shouldn't be in emote only mode

[3:49:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[3:49:08] <@Solidus_113> shhhh
[3:49:15] <Cobaltor_252> @Cobaltor_252 I didn't see notes on it so I'd assume so
[3:49:20] <VJdarkworld> a glitch that drops you into the videogame Death Loop monkaS
[3:49:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, stop talking about the Hunter's ex, the Doll just looks like her Kappa
[3:49:31] <yukichocomilk> @VJdarkworld a fate worse than death
[3:49:35] <DancesWitBalrog> wait, did the doll ever enter the house in the orginal?
[3:49:35] <rasamune> they're just little guys havin a good time
[3:49:47] <pennykettle_> I dont think so @DancesWitBalrog
[3:49:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DancesWitBalrog she did
[3:49:49] <CappuccinoGuil> "Why can't you be like my old girlfriend, babe?"
[3:49:51] <AngryAsian5> Kappa Kappa
[3:49:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> She would roam around the dream
[3:50:00] <pennykettle_> LUL
[3:50:00] <BlackermanZX> not even the game, just the Death Loop trailers on repeat monkaS
[3:50:04] <+Prism_Zet> what weapon you wnat?
[3:50:17] <VJdarkworld> @blackermanzx monkaS
[3:50:17] <andre11dr> Probably the sword
[3:50:30] <DancesWitBalrog> i think he wants the spin to win axe
[3:50:32] <+theoldone001> Eh, Maria is alright. Now the Winter Lanterns now those are women!
[3:50:44] <DeathByPoke7> blades of mercy?
[3:50:45] <DSD24> @theoldone001 They have lovely singing voices
[3:50:51] <+Prism_Zet> i was thinking pilebunker, lol or the lead fist
[3:50:53] <@Solidus_113> bird
[3:50:59] <alroy909> @theoldone001 Truth
[3:51:03] <%emptyantics> Pilebunker Kreygasm
[3:51:06] <majindusto> I dont remember  the doll ever entering  the house  in the OG game
[3:51:07] <andre11dr> @thomasvalentine31 Those are women to bring back home to your parents
[3:51:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @theoldone001 one look puts you into a frenzy
[3:51:13] <+Grayhammatter> but you get a call beyond now? wtf?
[3:51:21] <%crybirb> Whats the name of the Spider girsl in Cainhurst? Those for me are the vilest design.
[3:51:22] <DancesWitBalrog> pilebunker is some anime shiit and i love it
[3:51:27] <+swivet0_o> hew whats up man how is everything going?
[3:51:35] <leith_aziz> Pilebunker? Did I stumble upon a convo about Slayer? cohhHmm
[3:51:44] <+swivet0_o> bloodborne is awesome
[3:51:44] <+Prism_Zet> @DancesWitBalrog it was so rough to use, but it was so friggin cool
[3:51:55] <leith_aziz> @swivet0_o Hello pickyWave
[3:52:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bearer, seek, seek, lest
[3:52:02] <heartlesshealer> Str build I see
[3:52:05] <charrchord> well what is it very now
[3:52:06] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Woolie Becomes Huge !!!!
[3:52:18] <andre11dr> @crybirb No ,the vilest design is the multi legged long haired woman form DS3
[3:52:20] <peachy996> Is the shock mace in this? Cuz if so the demake is its one chancce to be good
[3:52:30] <%emptyantics> @danceswitbalrog A rough weapon to beat the game with but fun as hell to use
[3:52:31] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Be Aggressive!
[3:52:34] <%crybirb> @andre11dr, what's their name? I don't remember what you are mentioning
[3:52:46] <+swivet0_o> @swivet0_o whats up!!!!!
[3:52:46] <+theoldone001> @crybirb They're called Bloodsucking Beasts. I think they're more ticks or fleas than spiders.
[3:52:47] <wandelmilch> @peachy996 The shock mace *is* in it but the game rocks regardless
[3:52:51] <SuperChumps> The new Bloodborne Hunter Figma got delayed several month. This one even has the whirligig saw included @WoolieVersus
[3:53:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @andre11dr do you mean those weird bony things in the river in irithyll?
[3:53:06] <+swesterly> @SuperChumps what's figma
[3:53:12] <%crybirb> @theoldone001, they give me the chills, it's the enemy I killed the least because I just fly past them. What cringes me is the belly full of blood.
[3:53:18] <peachy996> @wandelmilch Oh I'm not knocking the game, just knocking the mace
[3:53:23] <%crybirb> Any "pregnant"-ish design in monsters makes me cringe really hard.
[3:53:25] <andre11dr> @crybirb The ones that first see in Irathil in yhe water
[3:53:31] <+Prism_Zet> you can get a few like right noew
[3:53:32] <SuperChumps> @swesterly figma nuts in your mouth
[3:53:36] <+Prism_Zet> if you go get them
[3:53:44] <+swesterly> @SuperChumps hey goteem
[3:53:45] <peachy996> In my opinion it's the most basic weapon in the game
[3:53:49] <+Prism_Zet> equip it lol, then use
[3:53:50] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Being faithful to original design while simplifying what makes sense its really an impressive effort they done here.
[3:53:52] <+theoldone001> @crybirb I always skipped them, they're in the Old Hunters DLC too but the ones in Cainhurst are stronger for some reason.
[3:54:05] <%ChoculaUltra> coldblood dew would've been a great promotional flavor for mountain dew FeelsGoodMan
[3:54:08] <QueequegTheater> Did woolie pet the dog
[3:54:10] <majindusto> Is this gonna lead to Reggie just actually playing Legit Bloodborne?
[3:54:13] <peachy996> @theoldone001 they're hungrier probably
[3:54:19] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb ohhh the like mosquito vampire women, yeah they are gross as F
[3:54:23] <%crybirb> @andre11dr, oh sewer centipede? Yeah they are creepy but I think the Blooduscking beasts are worse
[3:54:27] <QueequegTheater> @majindusto They still have DS2
[3:54:28] <SuperChumps> @swesterly just a game status with swappable hunter weapons for display to answer your question
[3:54:29] <heartlesshealer> of course
[3:54:49] <+swesterly> @SuperChumps gotcha
[3:54:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @majindusto i think they'll eventually get to it regardless of this, though i do wonder if this will change the order they go through
[3:54:54] <+CAPSLOCKlive> HUGE
[3:54:57] <+swivet0_o> how is everybody doing tonight?
[3:54:59] <peachy996> Shout outs to the Chalice Spider Ladies who show up every time you visceral a big guy
[3:55:03] <+heyitsdenzel_> luck
[3:55:14] <majindusto> Just  skip DS2...No loss really lol
[3:55:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> He is lucky he is so strong
[3:55:18] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Chonky boy!
[3:55:20] <%crybirb> @Prism_Zet, yeah man, what gets me is the pregnant-ish design. I always hate that kind of design in anything. In Monster Hunter Rise one of the new monsters is pregnant-ish and I hated it.
[3:55:25] <%andrewofbob> All Ps
[3:55:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> DS2 sucks...but has the best magic
[3:55:27] <Jontman42> just play perfect
[3:55:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @majindusto but i wanna see reggie vs fume knight
[3:55:35] <QueequegTheater> @majindusto cringe
[3:55:38] <VidulaSaix> 4Head
[3:55:47] <peachy996> DS2 Sucks but Maula Theme still wonderful
[3:55:48] <+Prism_Zet> @crybirb the way it dragged, or when the pop, just ugh
[3:55:49] <%LastHazzerd> i would simply choose not to

[3:56:07] <QueequegTheater> @andre11dr nope

[3:59:02] <%emptyantics> Reggie just needs to beat DS2 and then BLOODBORNE TIME Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:59:07] <Nogopharo> He hasn't fought Cleric yet has he?
[3:59:09] <pennykettle_> like this looks to be the same location but designed to look like the house
[3:59:15] <+CAPSLOCKlive> This would be the Under Bridge near the Elevator in the original, right?
[3:59:20] <+Prism_Zet> lol you gonna open that door and ignore it?
[3:59:23] <pennykettle_> yooo
[3:59:25] <%emptyantics> @capslocklive Yes
[3:59:25] <Boegame> aint no way a psx is rendering this light :V
[3:59:28] <peachy996> This is a very good remixed Central Yharnam
[3:59:34] <kes009900> has he fought Cleric yet?
[3:59:39] <+jz_thepenmaster> The devs worked so hard to give us relic graphic
[3:59:40] <andre11dr> @emptyantics They said that they might do DS3 first
[3:59:40] <VidulaSaix> No
[3:59:44] <@Solidus_113> this lighting should be blocky like half life 1
[3:59:55] <+swesterly> opened a door?
[3:59:56] <VidulaSaix> Just ignored the door LUL
[3:59:57] <%emptyantics> @andre11dr Interesting, I wonder why 🤔
[3:59:59] <BlackermanZX> missed a door
[4:00:01] <+Prism_Zet> lol just ignored the door
[4:00:03] <thunderborn32> door\
[4:00:06] <pennykettle_> let the old man shoot you FeelsBadMan
[4:00:08] <+Grayhammatter> the door?
[4:00:21] <+theoldone001> I wonder if Demakes will catch on with publishers, there's been a few indie games that have done it but no like mainstream interest in it.
[4:00:26] <cossuoldm> open door, refuse to aknowledge it, leave area
[4:00:34] <Jontman42> the door the door gotta get the door
[4:00:45] <%emptyantics> DS1 would work perfectly for a Demake
[4:00:48] <QueequegTheater> Press square to yell DOOR
[4:00:51] <+Grayhammatter> oh, barrels?
[4:00:53] <+Prism_Zet> @cossuoldm baffling exploration choices lol
[4:00:55] <+3d_pbandj> remember, Square to walk
[4:01:08] <+swesterly> i think he is aware of the door but just doesn't want to reload the area guys
[4:01:13] <+Grayhammatter> yo... this place is huge
[4:01:16] <+S3xGAZEBO> oh no he is doing the snailbourn walk again!
[4:01:21] <@Solidus_113> what a mansion
[4:01:22] <VidulaSaix> If you open a door and its a zone switch it auto zones you
[4:01:27] <QueequegTheater> dat's a alllliiiieeeeennnn
[4:01:33] <peachy996> Yeah it is
[4:01:35] <+CAPSLOCKlive> i really hope this Demake sparks a series of game creators or Kickstarters trying to doa bit more of this... until they obviously overdo it
[4:01:36] <pennykettle_> yea you can fall in
[4:01:37] <heartlesshealer> under bridge
[4:01:39] <Jontman42> less street, more house
[4:01:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, maybe
[4:01:40] <heartlesshealer> or beside
[4:01:40] <+Prism_Zet> it is
[4:01:42] <andre11dr> Yo ,what if someone Demakes RE8 into a classic tank control style RE game

[4:10:36] <+McDumDum> who's playing the kazoo
[4:10:36] <%mr_sups> That's in BB too
[4:10:36] <+theoldone001> It's my favorie theme in BB, lots of other themes are banger themes too but the Cleric Beast theme sets the mood
[4:10:40] <pennykettle_> And Cleric Beast has Manus fur
[4:10:52] <+Prism_Zet> @andre11dr i've seen him die on dumber stuff lol
[4:10:55] <%mr_sups> @theoldone001 Gascoigne I think does that for me.

[4:11:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus The doll always wakes up at ONE insight
[4:11:37] <pennykettle_> do you have to spend the badge somewhere?
[4:11:38] <@Solidus_113> you have the saw
[4:11:42] <Nogopharo> Is he trying to buy the axe?
[4:11:46] <thunderborn32> no kirk or holy blade
[4:11:47] <heartlesshealer> you picked the saw, so the badge is whatever

[4:11:51] <+Grayhammatter> threaded cane though
[4:11:56] <DancesWitBalrog> i think he wants the axe
[4:11:57] <+Rafraud> You have the badge I think
[4:11:58] <+cdrom321> He could open the door inside the workshop.
[4:11:58] <VidulaSaix> Its cause you have it already
[4:12:02] <+Prism_Zet> no woolie, not yet
[4:12:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Look at the badge
[4:12:09] <+CAPSLOCKlive> check the badge
[4:12:14] <+Rafraud> Look at it
[4:12:14] <DancesWitBalrog> or does he want Ludwig's hammer?
[4:12:16] <OblivionSword1> you have the badge for the saw cleaver chat said
[4:12:21] <Boegame> You can buy the new gear, its just the starter gear in this
[4:12:22] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus a boss drops the axe fyi
[4:12:33] <+swesterly> you have the items otherwise unlocked by that particular badge
[4:12:33] <+TheDandyGuy> how much of the game is in the demake? no way it's the whole game, right
[4:12:34] <+Jack8274> Wow this still runs at a higher FPS than OG Bloodborne
[4:12:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheDandyGuy up to gaskawng
[4:12:48] <BreakfastSampler> @TheDandyGuy through father gascaglongonoca
[4:12:54] <+Prism_Zet> @Jack8274 nah its capped at 20, but you can unlock it to whatever you can run
[4:13:11] <CappuccinoGuil> you have 5 insight, can you open more doors?
[4:13:14] <thunderborn32> @Jack8274 it can run at 60 fps or even higher, but everyone sets the graphics to the minimum for some reason
[4:13:15] <pennykettle_> Do you give the badge to someone in the workshop? Since you can open new doors now? Just spitballing
[4:13:24] <+swesterly> @thunderborn32 DEmake
[4:13:27] <+GenesysCreed> Do you have to equip it like a key?
[4:13:28] <Boegame> You got the starter gear in shop, woolie, thats all
[4:13:29] <%itstreylar> is it on the key ring
[4:13:44] <Jontman42> 20 fps is authentic
[4:13:48] <KasiCrafter> Wait. If you have the Saw Badge but already picked the Saw, what would that unlock?
[4:13:54] <Nogopharo> You get the axe from somewhere else.
[4:13:57] <Foopoof> Has he got to gascweh yet?
[4:14:04] <Boegame> @KasiCrafter The cane and the other gun

[4:16:03] <+kewlmyc> @Juriasu If this was the full game, I'd actually content.
[4:16:07] <rasamune> I thought that'd just be an undo button
[4:16:10] <%Namillus> When you rate messages in the real game, the Messengers react with those corresponding animations, it's sick
[4:16:18] <andre11dr> Their your only friends
[4:16:22] <+Prism_Zet> lol there ARE weapons just go get them
[4:16:44] <thunderborn32> there are some custom weapons in this you may wanna hold off
[4:16:45] <slipdog> from peaked

[4:17:40] <+xXxPS9xXx> they better finish this game soon, only a matter of time before the maker has to face the cease and desist attack from the Orphan of Lawyer lol
[4:17:43] <andre11dr> Or at least one of the best ones
[4:17:44] <Arqartur0> for a moment I thought she was speaking French

[4:18:09] <+CAPSLOCKlive> SWOLBORNE
[4:18:11] <Paltheos> Huh. I didn't expect this. Playing Bloodborne PSX instead of vanilla.
[4:18:11] <thunderborn32> the creator is part of a dev team working on an actual game so i dont think theyll be making more than this first level
[4:18:29] <Awesome_Leaf> 27 fans D:
[4:18:31] <+Reverend_Roscoe> fuck 12
[4:18:32] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[4:18:34] <QueequegTheater> 26 is an awful number
[4:18:35] <+Rafraud> Woolie right
[4:18:35] <GeneralSCPatton> 3³
[4:18:39] <Iwashi94> 27 fans in shambles
[4:18:39] <yukichocomilk> 27 fans in SHAMBLES
[4:18:39] <+tomdwarf> Thats very true
[4:18:40] <+S3xGAZEBO> oh god he has become pat
[4:18:40] <+swesterly> 0 or 5 but yeah
[4:18:42] <Fabpsi_> 0 or 5 at the end
[4:18:43] <Paltheos> 27 *is* an attractive number. It's 3 raised to the power of itself.
[4:18:43] <+king_of_mystery2> 26 is not nice number woolie, you are wrong, nothing between 25 and 30 is nice
[4:18:47] <QueequegTheater> IT MUST END IN 2 OR 8, FUCK YOU ALL
[4:18:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> woolie's got the volume goblins
[4:18:50] <andre11dr> 19 is the worst
[4:19:00] <TigerClaws12> fucking 13 being the sweet spot kills me everytime
[4:19:02] <%Namillus> The only nice numbers are 59 and 420 c'mon
[4:19:02] <+S3xGAZEBO> pat infected him
[4:19:04] <peachy996> It has to be at a multiple of 10 or higher
[4:19:04] <andre11dr> Fuck 19
[4:19:05] <Fabpsi_> 19 does. not. exist.
[4:19:05] <Boegame> prime numbers ONLY
[4:19:06] <+RJay80> tell alot about a man by the volume of his tv
[4:19:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> he is right tho
[4:19:07] <%jamsbybetty> prime numbers ONLY
[4:19:09] <yukichocomilk> it must be a prime number
[4:19:09] <+king_of_mystery2> the existence of the acceptable 5's removes the acceptance of the even's between the 5 and the 0
[4:19:11] <+Rafraud> @andre11dr 19 actually just made me viscerally reel back in my chair
[4:19:11] <+swesterly> crazy talk requiem
[4:19:18] <Paltheos> Yeah, I'm with Reggie. 33's not as attractive a number. No special properties except that it's the product of 2 primes.
[4:19:21] <%andrewofbob> 25 is a square number, 27 is a cube number; a factor or 26 is 13
[4:19:24] <%Lunalios> who uses 19 in any context?
[4:19:27] <%jamsbybetty> out of all the numbers, fuck 12
[4:19:28] <thunderborn32> all stats 19 run
[4:19:28] <Carlioo> wow threaded cane is in this? dev knows what's up
[4:19:31] <BlackermanZX> i despise 54 for some reason
[4:19:31] <%jamsbybetty> 1312 can stay tho
[4:19:37] <Paltheos> @Lunalios 19 has some cool points as a prime.
[4:19:44] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @jamsbybetty that's what I'm talking about
[4:19:44] <+pectusumbra> EXCEPT resistances
[4:19:47] <heartlesshealer> unless poison resistance
[4:19:50] <@Solidus_113> all the stats that matter are the status effects like frenzy and poison
[4:19:53] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus Except the Frenzy Set, especially if you're playing a high insight build.
[4:19:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> idk, some armors got great resist for frenzy or poison
[4:19:55] <slipdog> element resistances are good
[4:19:59] <+Grayhammatter> go IN
[4:20:02] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Drip Souls
[4:20:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> prime numbers are for dorks

[4:20:37] <%Lunalios> @paltheos nerd.
[4:20:40] <Paltheos> @ReallyBigRocks They're not the coolest but they're not the lamest. Most composite numbers are boring.
[4:21:01] <+S3xGAZEBO> hunters set is in the sewers
[4:21:02] <+swesterly> wrong badge
[4:21:03] <pennykettle_> Can you equip the badge and use it like a key on the basth
[4:21:04] <pennykettle_> bath*
[4:21:05] <+S3xGAZEBO> originally
[4:21:11] <+RigniGardenki> @WoolieVersus it's not the badge that drops in cleric in the original
[4:21:23] <thunderborn32> door next to 2 trolls is new you ignored it
[4:21:25] <+RigniGardenki> you don't get saw hunter at cleric in ps4, you get sword
[4:21:31] <Paltheos> monkaW
[4:21:48] <@Solidus_113> you want the Sword Hunter Badge
[4:21:50] <Paltheos> Interact jphPog
[4:21:52] <BlackermanZX> so whats behind the ignored troll door

[4:22:22] <%Lunalios> oh, this is cute
[4:22:25] <Paltheos> ... the visual presentation reminds me allot of Vagrant Story. Well, aside from the lack of cool text bubbles.
[4:22:26] <Foopoof> He caught the omicron Sadge
[4:22:26] <slipdog> fuckin bert
[4:22:27] <andre11dr> Chester pose

[4:22:37] <SoaringTrumpet> dude has it rough
[4:22:39] <Boegame> ooooh these are scenes from a fan comic i think
[4:22:42] <mr_saturday93> like what they need with the npcs
[4:22:44] <%Bluwizard21> this is so much better than the ps4 version
[4:22:45] <%hax_metatron> THIS HAPPENS IN THE MAIN GAME BRO
[4:22:49] <peachy996> You are just Erron Black
[4:22:50] <DeathByPoke7> CurseLit
[4:22:51] <slipdog> @Boegame no
[4:22:53] <OblivionSword1> huh
[4:22:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> FLAMESPRAYER he does this in the main game
[4:22:54] <NickWearsGlasses> so is this like, all of bloodborne?
[4:22:56] <+Rafraud> simply get the weapons
[4:22:58] <+swesterly> @hax_metatron yeah but not until much later
[4:22:58] <BoneofMalkav> Ze Flammenwaffer
[4:22:58] <%hax_metatron> NOOO
[4:22:58] <Fabpsi_> nice
[4:23:01] <%Bluwizard21> @hax_metatron but not that cinematic
[4:23:02] <+BurgundyStrikerRaz> Huh?
[4:23:08] <QueequegTheater> @NickWearsGlasses Up to Gaskwang
[4:23:12] <+swesterly> @BoneofMalkav werfs ze flammen
[4:23:14] <%Namillus> No in the main game the Flamesprayer unlocks when you kill Cleric
[4:23:15] <%hax_metatron> Yeah not the cinematic, but he does give you Flamesprayer
[4:23:15] <cossuoldm> Why did he have a flamethrower?
[4:23:15] <moonmintparadise> after Gascoine you can get it
[4:23:17] <%robosqueeb> it werfens flammwn
[4:23:19] <%Lunalios> it's the first arcane weapon you get
[4:23:22] <Boegame> @Boegame I mean, the conversation happens in game, just how they framed it here in the cutscene looks like a fan comic rendition of it
[4:23:23] <TigerClaws12> the miyazaki swamps
[4:23:24] <Paltheos> Yeah, the sewers :)
[4:23:24] <AstrodropGaming> Ah, fire
[4:23:26] <thunderborn32> YEYEYEYEYEYE PIG FISTING
[4:23:28] <Fabpsi_> colourful he says....
[4:23:31] <slipdog> nope
[4:23:39] <+BurgundyStrikerRaz> Oh nah this is in the original. He gives you the flamespayer this early if you talk to him early like this
[4:23:43] <Paltheos> @TigerClaws12 All of life's a swamp~
[4:23:43] <kes009900> @cossuoldm laundry
[4:24:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> i wonder what the flame sprayer does
[4:24:06] <slipdog> spicy watering can
[4:24:07] <WonderSign> cleric beast slapped me off the edge of the bridge and came with me. ill take that since he glitched out and wasnt taking damage
[4:24:12] <cossuoldm> nothing cleans blood spots from white church clothing like a bit of purifying flames, I guess?
[4:24:16] <mudox1717> its so sick.
[4:24:16] <+MyHandsAreBlank> Are the cough sfx as bad in the original as they are here? This is a nightmare to a misphone
[4:24:23] <Fabpsi_> god this looks just tight and perfect
[4:24:25] <+Dives__> fmgFINE Spray those flames
[4:24:25] <slipdog> uses bullets
[4:24:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:24:27] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That fire effect is CRAZY for ps1
[4:24:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> It used quicksilver
[4:24:32] <$LightningLynx89> @MyHandsAreBlank The compression makes it more horrific
[4:24:32] <velgaduere> @MyHandsAreBlank yes, but of course more clear
[4:24:37] <NickWearsGlasses> @queequegtheater ah i see, a bummer but i can understand it wouldn't be easy to do all of that in this style
[4:24:39] <+MyHandsAreBlank> @velgaduere Nightmare Nightmare Nightmare
[4:24:41] <%ChoculaUltra> not bad
[4:24:41] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that fire would lag it to shit
[4:24:41] <peachy996> Slowly uses your quicksilver
[4:24:42] <%Lunalios> looks really good for ps1
[4:24:53] <BoneofMalkav> That fire effect would probably make the PS1 hardware explode LUL
[4:25:01] <%Namillus> @NickWearsGlasses It's Central Yharnam but spiced up a bit
[4:25:02] <+Rafraud> He's fiiiiiiiiine
[4:25:11] <%ChoculaUltra> that's a nasty cough
[4:25:12] <Paltheos> I don't know. I don't think it looks like that much more complicated than like an FF7 fire spell.
[4:25:15] <peachy996> Do you need a lozenge sir?
[4:25:16] <+3d_pbandj> heck yea that fire effect should take the FPS to 1
[4:25:46] <%Namillus> "I know exactly where it is" He's gonna walk right past it again isn't he lol
[4:25:53] <+Grayhammatter> finally bout to see what's in that door
[4:25:55] <Louie_Salmon> @paltheos Yeah but that's on a pre-rendered background, not fully 3D
[4:26:08] <+RJay80> Better do something about that cough...
[4:26:19] <Fabpsi_> sounds about right
[4:26:21] <Fabpsi_> maybe

[4:28:15] <andre11dr> @arqartur0 No ,where should place said eyes?

[4:28:17] <Paltheos> YOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:28:17] <Fabpsi_> tight
[4:28:19] <WerdIce> @S3xGAZEBO She is!
[4:28:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> poggies
[4:28:29] <+S3xGAZEBO> @thunderborn32 nice!
[4:28:29] <Paltheos> That parrying level up
[4:28:29] <turnbull_james> wow i can't believe they're playing the original bloodborne that was later remade on the ps4. that thing is a hidden treasure!
[4:28:31] <Fabpsi_> poor doogo
[4:28:33] <Arqartur0> @andre11dr wherever there is holes.
[4:28:39] <Nogopharo> Blood on the outside is cool but have you tried eyes on the inside?!
[4:28:41] <%hax_metatron> Wait until Sekiro where you can PARRY DOGS
[4:28:48] <%Maloane> ya love to see a  C O U N T E R
[4:29:07] <kes009900> daigo be like Kappa
[4:29:09] <%hax_metatron> S E W E R T I M E
[4:29:12] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's physically impossible for me to start a BB playthrough and not riposte the first werewolf.
[4:29:15] <Arqartur0> So, why this version of Bloodborne?
[4:29:18] <VidulaSaix> ratJam
[4:29:32] <thunderborn32> to be fair riposting werewolves feels so rewarding
[4:29:35] <Arqartur0> because of Silent Hill?
[4:29:41] <Nogopharo> Because it came out on Tuesday
[4:29:49] <Arqartur0> @Nogopharo oooh
[4:29:50] <rasamune> Because it came out two days ago and why not
[4:29:52] <Nogopharo> Or monday whatever
[4:29:53] <Fabpsi_> because it just came out and is an interesting take and sneakpeak. they gonna some of the other souls-like games before bloodborne for reggie too
[4:29:57] <VidulaSaix> OhMyDog
[4:30:02] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Arqartur0 Likely has something to do with FromSOft's refusal to port this to PC so people can mod it to death.
[4:30:04] <%SainEdge> @Arqartur0 just came out and is much shorter than OG Bloodborne
[4:30:22] <Fabpsi_> look at that wooden shield
[4:30:29] <Fabpsi_> look how useful it was
[4:30:38] <andre11dr> That was JANK
[4:30:46] <%Santamooo> woolieYE
[4:30:50] <%LastHazzerd> wtf happened with that visceral attack
[4:30:54] <Fabpsi_> always drop that shield and never pick it up
[4:30:55] <Paltheos> @Fabpsi_ I love that BB trolls you in the description for it.
[4:30:56] <andre11dr> Is this made in Europe ?
[4:30:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> PSX JANK EVERYONE
[4:31:16] <Fabpsi_> eheh yea
[4:31:25] <andre11dr> I need to know if it's Eurojank
[4:31:32] <velgaduere> people really asking "wtf was that" in a demake created by a single person LUL
[4:31:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:31:38] <+Grayhammatter> one of these yes
[4:31:38] <%okuriskyles> no it's just normal jank
[4:31:50] <Fabpsi_> this is just overall truly impressive, not gonna lie
[4:32:12] <%Juriasu> the enemy ai seems a bit iffy sometime lol
[4:32:14] <SoaringTrumpet> @velgaduere the creator really did an amazing job overall
[4:32:15] <thunderborn32> lantern!
[4:32:17] <+swesterly> au naturale
[4:32:21] <zhenthrim213> noone shaves in yharnam
[4:32:22] <Paltheos> A lantern jphPog
[4:32:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they need manscaped
[4:32:28] <+CAPSLOCKlive> they dont have Shave Club in Yarhnam
[4:32:37] <%RigmaroleHM> That sounded like the Switch sound
[4:32:39] <+theoldone001> Sounds like the Switch snap sound
[4:32:43] <velgaduere> @SoaringTrumpet my point exactly
[4:32:45] <+liquidzr0> so yharnam is a smash tournament?
[4:32:48] <+swesterly> you need more eyes Kappa
[4:32:56] <+Grayhammatter> need more eyes on the inside
[4:33:03] <Sonny_Firestorm> It was an unexpected latern placement but more and more I'm starting to like that latern there.
[4:33:03] <%okuriskyles> i just popped in, how far have they got on here?
[4:33:11] <%Feralspirit41> Cleric beast is dead
[4:33:13] <thunderborn32> @okuriskyles cleric down
[4:33:18] <%okuriskyles> nice
[4:33:34] <%Feralspirit41> And alot of stuff is different
[4:33:45] <+kewlmyc> The fucking jukes.
[4:33:48] <+CAPSLOCKlive> cant wait for someone to Mod this Demake into Elden Ring
[4:33:52] <+S3xGAZEBO> that is when transformation attacks would be handy
[4:33:57] <%okuriskyles> yeah, I know a lot of stuff is different. I played some of it on Tuesday though I didn't get far
[4:34:02] <thunderborn32> @okuriskyles and he hasn't found any of the extra added content, only dont base bloodborne stuff
[4:34:17] <%okuriskyles> got juked several times
[4:34:37] <+swesterly> bullet skirting is so real
[4:34:41] <pennykettle_> Im gonna be honest, I think the demake could use some music playing in normal areas too
[4:34:51] <%Feralspirit41> I like it the way it is
[4:35:00] <%Feralspirit41> the lack of ambiance is good ambiance
[4:35:02] <%Santamooo> Ugh this makes me want to hook up my PS4
[4:35:03] <+CAPSLOCKlive> some nice wind and night ambience wouldnt be bad
[4:35:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> @CAPSLOCKlive Oh don't worry, it's coming.
[4:35:20] <%Juriasu> there is wind
[4:35:26] <+kewlmyc> Wait, has Reggie played
[4:35:27] <+tomdwarf> @pennykettle_ I mean, that wouldnt be accurate to the base game.
[4:35:30] <%Feralspirit41> I think it captures the tech level of the psx well
[4:35:37] <+kewlmyc> Played Bloodborne, that is
[4:35:38] <Fabpsi_> y'all just want to hear the dev making weird animal sounds using their own voice, don't you?
[4:35:48] <pennykettle_> @tomdwarf a lot of this isnt accurate to the base game
[4:35:50] <velgaduere> @Feralspirit41 to be fair, most PS1 games are playing music at all times
[4:35:54] <%okuriskyles> sewer??
[4:35:56] <+S3xGAZEBO> that's the sewers
[4:35:57] <%Santamooo> @kewlmyc nope
[4:35:58] <%Bluwizard21> TAKE IT
[4:35:58] <%oneimportantthing> The npc screams in this version are actually horrifying
[4:36:00] <%Feralspirit41> @velgaduere true
[4:36:02] <Al_VII> Sewers yes
[4:36:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> possible sewer
[4:36:04] <+Grayhammatter> that's the sewers
[4:36:07] <%Bluwizard21> It leads places
[4:36:10] <Ipsenscastle> this was in the original
[4:36:11] <thunderborn32> its a drop in base game too
[4:36:29] <+tomdwarf> @pennykettle_ I guess, I would be surprised and confused if they added music in regular areas.
[4:36:31] <Sonny_Firestorm> In the original that's where you drop to find the signature hunter outfit.
[4:36:48] <BlackermanZX> rolling into stuff Link style
[4:36:57] <AllenDeadman> oh I remember this area
[4:37:00] <Fabpsi_> and now you die
[4:37:06] <velgaduere> @Feralspirit41 but I agree with you if not for the simple fact that introducing new, original compositions that you'd hear more than any of the "original" stuff would be a misstep
[4:37:09] <%Feralspirit41> Assassins creed leap of faith
[4:37:14] <+fangking1414> @Sonny_Firestorm yeah then you and your co-host sell it cause you think its a duplicate\
[4:37:42] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Sonny_Firestorm The trousers and gloves tecnically are.
[4:37:57] <AllenDeadman> yup
[4:38:03] <velgaduere> hell yeah let's go
[4:38:04] <%Feralspirit41> @velgaduere i just like that youre not really hearing anything outside of combat besides footsteps and some light wind
[4:38:05] <velgaduere> it's time
[4:38:06] <%Santamooo> damn, that water effect lmao
[4:38:06] <%Juriasu> this is was there in the original I think? haven't played in a few years tgough
[4:38:10] <+Rafraud> OOOOF
[4:38:13] <thunderborn32> @Sonny_Firestorm at least in this one the stat bonuses are different
[4:38:14] <BoneofMalkav> Civie11 Sewer Water Counter: 9999
[4:38:15] <+Grayhammatter> yes it was
[4:38:15] <@Solidus_113> rrat time
[4:38:18] <%Feralspirit41> God that water
[4:38:23] <FirelordHouse> You can literally just walk off
[4:38:24] <BlackermanZX> obligatory sewer level
[4:38:24] <majindusto> Ewwwww Poo Water
[4:38:29] <%andrewofbob> This is some Quake sounding water
[4:38:29] <+CAPSLOCKlive> The Royal Rat Authority has returned
[4:38:33] <+kewlmyc> Rat and/or Pig time
[4:38:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:38:35] <Fabpsi_> this looks very clean, no poop in sight
[4:38:36] <+fangking1414> @Sonny_Firestorm this is a reference to when pat and woolie sold the outfit in their lp of bloodborne on sbfp
[4:38:37] <%Juriasu> yo if you saw this water back in the day it would blow your mind
[4:38:37] <+S3xGAZEBO> that was always an entrance to the sewers
[4:38:39] <Arqartur0> Fetid Water
[4:38:40] <Ipsenscastle> this is so authentic, the water noises are giving me Psone flashbacks
[4:38:42] <%LastHazzerd> nice water 10/10
[4:38:44] <velgaduere> @Feralspirit41 yeah, it keeps the original spirit of it, but finding that balance between "PS1 game" and "straight demake" is tough, but that was the creator's vision, and they nailed it
[4:38:49] <Boegame> googly eye rats!!!
[4:38:55] <Boegame> they got that big insight
[4:38:56] <%oneimportantthing> British sewers are much worse than this
[4:38:56] <Fabpsi_> rat time!
[4:39:02] <+CAPSLOCKlive> These rats go in!
[4:39:10] <%Feralspirit41> Yharnam doesnt really strike me as a clean city
[4:39:16] <%Feralspirit41> even outside the hunt
[4:39:17] <Ipsenscastle> @oneimportantthing this is an absurdly spacious sewer
[4:39:26] <%oneimportantthing> @feralspirit41 Cleaner than London lol
[4:39:27] <%CodenameChaz> But which one is the giant rat that makes all the rules
[4:39:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> i think the creater did a damn good job with the amount of "old game wonkyness" they put in
[4:39:34] <Fabpsi_> having a lantern in your sewers is always a good sign of a clean city
[4:39:34] <thunderborn32> @Feralspirit41 it strikes me as a city with lots of cocaine
[4:39:43] <%Feralspirit41> @oneimportantthing nah they just dump everything in the river its all good
[4:39:50] <+swesterly> they prey at night they stalk at night
[4:39:54] <+S3xGAZEBO> the snailbourn two steps and stop... now THAT is giving me nostalgia!
[4:40:00] <+Grayhammatter> none of these rats make all of the rules
[4:40:01] <%Feralspirit41> @thunderborn32 cocaine wont make you hallucinate like these guys do
[4:40:03] <Lt_Campbell> jermaChomp Gimme dat ass
[4:40:06] <majindusto> R.O.U.S.es!!!!
[4:40:16] <Fabpsi_> that rat had a plan
[4:40:16] <%oneimportantthing> These water textures are better than Pokemon Legends LUL
[4:40:19] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[4:40:20] <Fabpsi_> it knew
[4:40:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:40:23] <%Feralspirit41> Bruh
[4:40:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[4:40:26] <VincentGraves> tried to cross him up
[4:40:27] <thunderborn32> @Feralspirit41 cut your blood beast pellets with cocaine for extra battle potency
[4:40:28] <%Feralspirit41> Why is that true
[4:40:29] <velgaduere> LUL
[4:40:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> just don't get ambushed 4Head
[4:40:41] <+mdogg500> so far how does this compare to the original?
[4:40:42] <%Feralspirit41> @thunderborn32 or pcp
[4:40:49] <+CAPSLOCKlive> @oneimportantthing damn that cuts. Its goddamn correct, but it cuts
[4:41:03] <+kewlmyc> @mdogg500 Stops at GasCoin
[4:41:04] <thunderborn32> @Feralspirit41 makes you a bit paranoid, but hell its yarnam who isn't
[4:41:14] <%Feralspirit41> Props to nintendo for taking that leap of faith and goung for the ps2 graphics all those kids are into these days
[4:41:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE BOXART SET
[4:41:23] <%Juriasu> finally some drip
[4:41:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> Drip started

[4:41:46] <%Feralspirit41> Duke nukem?
[4:41:49] <Boegame> makes sense to find the drip in the sewer

[4:42:35] <+kewlmyc> Honestly big props to Sony for not C&D this like a certain other gaming company would
[4:42:41] <+swesterly> bearer, seek, seek, drip
[4:42:58] <%Feralspirit41> Drip; Acquired
[4:43:04] <Dr_Mooose> the drip

[4:43:07] <BreakfastSampler> PogChamp
[4:43:08] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah the game was called Nightmare Creatures
[4:43:10] <BlackermanZX> yeyeyeye
[4:43:10] <Arqartur0> Yeyeyeyeye
[4:43:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEYEYEYE

[4:43:13] <%crybirb> finaly hunters garb
[4:43:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> PogChamp PogChamp
[4:43:13] <Fabpsi_> the true dark souls begins here
[4:43:13] <+Grayhammatter> dripborne
[4:43:14] <verscoll> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:43:15] <Boegame> John Bloodborne has arrived
[4:43:16] <%oneimportantthing> Fashionborne
[4:43:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> THE BUCKLES
[4:43:19] <%baka_sugoi> John Born Blood
[4:43:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> doesn't afraid of anything
[4:43:20] <+kewlmyc> BLOODBORNE MAN
[4:43:22] <leomuratore> John Bloodborne is here
[4:43:25] <asakura_ayase> John bloodsouls
[4:43:30] <Arqartur0> It has to Jean Bloodborne.
[4:43:33] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That texture was WAY too clean for PS1, but ilove it
[4:43:47] <%Feralspirit41> It deserves to be that clean
[4:43:50] <Fabpsi_> party bridge
[4:43:57] <%okuriskyles> Bobby Bloodborne!!
[4:43:57] <+Grayhammatter> party bridge
[4:43:59] <%Feralspirit41> Like the party cave but smaller
[4:44:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> imagine the psx party cave
[4:44:09] <VincentGraves> armor in this game does more than the source material
[4:44:11] <%Feralspirit41> @okuriskyles nice
[4:44:12] <+swesterly> @CAPSLOCKlive the game finds a delicate balance between authenticity and practicality
[4:44:16] <+kewlmyc> It's just a random quotable line
[4:44:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> party rockers in the house tonight
[4:44:20] <%oneimportantthing> Bloodborne armor is just insignificant enough that you can focus on fashion above utility
[4:44:22] <gespenstkick> Bodied
[4:44:25] <velgaduere> well then
[4:44:27] <T_Sasquatch> im glad atleast one souls game had the cover armor early in the game and not at the ass end of it
[4:44:31] <%Feralspirit41> The party cave is probably its own zone in this version
[4:44:35] <thunderborn32> a hoonter must hoont
[4:44:44] <ExpressNode> So does this game follow the map structure of bloodborne or is it its own thing?
[4:44:46] <%okuriskyles> huunter
[4:44:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> WUSS DAT SMELL
[4:44:54] <+Grayhammatter> a hoonter must hoont
[4:44:56] <+swesterly> @ExpressNode about 90% yeah
[4:44:57] <%Feralspirit41> ES BLUUUUUUUUD
[4:44:58] <%oneimportantthing> @thunderborn32 AAAAH i'm hoonting
[4:45:00] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Smell Like Bluuuuuuud
[4:45:01] <CappuccinoGuil> a hoonter must hoont
[4:45:02] <%okuriskyles> it MOSTLY follows the map structure but there are some differences
[4:45:03] <%holydeviant1> Oh, I'm HUUUUUNTING
[4:45:04] <gespenstkick> John Bloodborne
[4:45:10] <+kewlmyc> @ExpressNode Mostly the same, but extends some areas
[4:45:18] <%superc37> @expressnode bout 80% the same, 20% its own thing
[4:45:19] <VincentGraves> saw spear in this?
[4:45:23] <thunderborn32> watching these really makes me wanna do another BB run
[4:45:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> could you possibly drop on that beam from here
[4:45:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1488410252294901762?t=WZ0CvLCs_v4kK_ekNvjRDQ&s=19
[4:45:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> nice
[4:45:40] <Fabpsi_> that's not how you hug a dog!
[4:45:41] <+RowenCleric> love the floating r1
[4:45:48] <%Intersceptre> Intersceptre subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 24 month streak! yo what the hell, put the bitrate up
[4:46:06] <@Menitta> How far did they get
[4:46:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is there no storage box?
[4:46:11] <+kewlmyc> I swore not to replay Bloodborne until I could do it in 60fps. That was 5 years ago. FeelsBadMan
[4:46:11] <+S3xGAZEBO> do the extra vials store like in the regular game?
[4:46:11] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Bout half
[4:46:12] <%Feralspirit41> Clerics down
[4:46:16] <@Menitta> Sick
[4:46:21] <%Feralspirit41> in the sewer now with new drip
[4:46:22] <Fabpsi_> exploring sewers, maybe half
[4:46:25] <peachy996> @Menitta Cleric down, Sewers no
[4:46:26] <+LittleCinders> Has Reggie played Bloodborne?
[4:46:26] <$LightningLynx89> I don't think they've fought Cleric yet
[4:46:29] <%Namillus> @S3xGAZEBO Did you see a storage box in the workshop?
[4:46:29] <+swesterly> i don't believe there is a storage box in the demake
[4:46:34] <@Menitta> I'll never forget how I accidentally skipped Cleric my first run
[4:46:38] <VincentGraves> Cleric has been beaten
[4:46:39] <%Feralspirit41> How
[4:46:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they fought and one shot cleric
[4:46:41] <thunderborn32> yeppers, there is no storage in demake
[4:46:42] <+Grayhammatter> woolie beat cleric
[4:46:51] <@Menitta> You can just avoid Cleric beast
[4:46:58] <+kewlmyc> @LightningLynx89 Woolie beat it first try 30 minutes ago
[4:47:02] <Fabpsi_> drip drop drip drop
[4:47:10] <%oneimportantthing> Most people don't realize Cleric is optional
[4:47:17] <%oneimportantthing> Until after it's beat
[4:47:18] <+CAPSLOCKlive> The fun part is that when Reggie goes for Bloodborne later, There will be no handholding cause woolie can just go "you already saw this"
[4:47:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> ahh jeez
[4:47:22] <%Feralspirit41> Now i remember. This demake reminds me of the harry potter games for the ps1
[4:47:28] <+swesterly> E X T E R i O R  C O L L i S i O N S
[4:47:39] <+Prism_Zet> use the gun to aim down

[4:47:52] <BlackermanZX> try courage
[4:47:58] <peachy996> @Menitta There's tons of things you can miss in BB. I think the mandatory run to finish is 7 bosses
[4:47:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> try courage
[4:48:01] <%okuriskyles> I played this on keyboard, so every time I tried to look down I'd instead shoot my gun

[5:03:08] <Jolly_Adventurer> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ LUL
[5:03:12] <%MyNameIsRasus> but corner is "coin", no g right?
[5:03:16] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Like woolie's friend Pat Boy-Vin
[5:03:20] <BlackermanZX> too much French blood
[5:03:29] <Fabpsi_> or not enough
[5:03:32] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> French all over the shop
[5:03:33] <+swesterly> @CAPSLOCKlive Boyvwang
[5:03:39] <velgaduere> @CAPSLOCKlive actually it's pronounced "fuck-boy-vin"
[5:03:40] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[5:03:41] <Fabpsi_> rekt
[5:03:50] <%oneimportantthing> @swesterly jesus fucking christ lmao
[5:03:59] <DancesWitBalrog> hack in slash (2022)
[5:04:00] <Fabpsi_> suddenly the wolf is a friendly reminder for "wait, this is still a game with enemies"
[5:04:00] <BlackermanZX> Fear the french blood
[5:04:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> outfootsied less go
[5:04:05] <andre11dr> @nadershahdidnothingwrong You'll be one of them, sooner or later
[5:04:20] <DancesWitBalrog> fear is the mind killer
[5:04:22] <%Santamooo> always just hit him
[5:04:22] <+swesterly> you have to *hit* him
[5:04:28] <Fabpsi_> best tip "If you want to deplete the enemy hp bar, try to hit him"
[5:04:28] <T_Sasquatch> These wolves arent a joke in the actual game
[5:04:29] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Never stop going in7
[5:04:34] <thunderborn32> i think my hypest bloodborne moment was finding out you can ripost amygdala with throwing knives
[5:04:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie you have to hit him
[5:04:35] <slackerunchained> It was the Silent hill dogs all over again for a sec, there. :P
[5:04:37] <Fabpsi_> shoot the enemy to deal damage woolie
[5:04:37] <Renzaku69> Stop trying to hit him and just hit em
[5:04:40] <%Feralspirit41> Who would win; a hunter trained to deafeat the worst beasts imaginable or one furry boy with some claws
[5:04:45] <BlackermanZX> is he going to the ignored door
[5:04:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> @BlackermanZX by god lawrence,le crains
[5:04:49] <T_Sasquatch> you have to HIT them woolie - Paat
[5:04:51] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Play it like DBZ. Always Dragon Rush Auto Combo
[5:04:54] <%oneimportantthing> This isn't Dark Souls, you gotta be faster than them
[5:05:03] <%Santamooo> still on it lmao
[5:05:05] <T_Sasquatch> ayyylieenss
[5:05:06] <+swesterly> true try to keep that door by the two trolls in mind
[5:05:10] <%G_Thunders> That jump is way too far right?
[5:05:12] <Fabpsi_> it is
[5:05:16] <%Juriasu> try courage
[5:05:16] <danknugglit> GasQOINGNE
[5:05:16] <+CAPSLOCKlive> not doable
[5:05:17] <%oneimportantthing> @t_sasquatch "........ speed"
[5:05:17] <+dreaith1> even some french name change between accent like Gaetan is pronounce different from french and quebec
[5:05:17] <StarlitStunner> sputThink
[5:05:18] <Awesome_Leaf> DO IT ANYWAY
[5:05:18] <%superc37> im p sure you cant make it
[5:05:19] <slackerunchained> A door for Ants!
[5:05:22] <+Grayhammatter> try courage
[5:05:26] <Fabpsi_> the back down is real
[5:05:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, wait wait wait... Woolie, are you saying people from different places, cultures and languages can pronounce things differently? MY GOD
[5:05:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I left for 5 mins, are we still on this topic? LUL
[5:05:46] <%oneimportantthing> Now how will people say Gascoine in Creole languages?
[5:05:50] <peachy996> At the end of the day it was a harmless mistake
[5:05:52] <+swesterly> nobody thinks that, literally everyone just loves the meme of it
[5:05:54] <%superc37> that happens in the dlc
[5:06:00] <slackerunchained> @CanadianAnimatorGuy OH WE'RE STILL ON IT.
[5:06:03] <$LightningLynx89> Woolie people just like the dumb meme
[5:06:03] <+tomdwarf> If it was different areas, thats fine
[5:06:04] <peachy996> It's not like you were freaking out over stats or anything
[5:06:10] <HanDaimond> Nightmare Creatures looks different
[5:06:11] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> oh boy
[5:06:14] <danknugglit> Im here for the memes
[5:06:15] <peachy996> And you were wrong about said stats
[5:06:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> like a pool of 10 moves, and when an enemy spawns they get like 5 of them at random? could be interesting
[5:06:24] <Fabpsi_> freaking out over stats? oh who would do that?.....
[5:06:26] <%G_Thunders> There’s enemies that change movesets if you have the torch out in the real game
[5:06:40] <+swesterly> @peachy996 oh man you're right that was wayyyyyy worse, that was wrong and doubling down on being wrong
[5:06:48] <slackerunchained> @HanDaimond And yet... not *that* different. :P
[5:06:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:06:54] <%Feralspirit41> Hunter kills defenseless old man
[5:07:06] <%Feralspirit41> More news at 11
[5:07:10] <+ArtemisCroc> once you adjust to the controls, this game actually feels great to play
[5:07:28] <Fabpsi_> maybe a 1 in a 1000 chance that there is a ResidentEvil door open animation coming around
[5:07:32] <Fabpsi_> i would smile at that
[5:07:33] <%oneimportantthing> So when is Reggie VS Bloodborne gonna happen? After Elden Ring?
[5:07:33] <andre11dr> @feralspirit41 He had a gun ,he MUST be hostile

[5:13:21] <%superc37> ngl, im surprised by how many pply havent heard about this till just now give how its been buzzing p loudly for like a year
[5:13:26] <BoneofMalkav> Hope more areas continue to be added to this.
[5:13:37] <velgaduere> @joeyduderman yeah it was a real gem
[5:13:41] <slackerunchained> @RobertWayneLewis98 I'm so glad that Reggie is getting introduced to this game with the *ORIGINAL*, rather than jumping right into the 'remake'... ;)

[5:25:04] <%crybirb> Didn't even do Gascoigne
[5:25:05] <majindusto> Reggie  hit Woolie  for Critical  Damage...It was SUPER EFFECTIVE!!!
[5:25:08] <%jonblnt> I'm not even a PC player and I want it out on PC
[5:25:08] <%Namillus> Oh wow the graphics settings affect the title screen
[5:25:17] <%holydeviant1> A woolie denied his 60
[5:25:20] <mudox1717> That was sick.
[5:25:20] <+Prism_Zet> Did here ever go back for the door in the derelict house?
[5:25:22] <@Menitta> even on fucking PS5, the frame pacing is still fucked. IT FEELS VINDICTIVE
[5:25:23] <slackerunchained> @crybirb I think you mean GASCAN
[5:25:25] <andre11dr> Woolie really thought he would finish this in one LUL
[5:25:26] <Fabpsi_> critical feeling strike via graphic settings
[5:25:27] <thunderborn32> @WoolieVersus keep in mind its not 1 to 1 there are added levels
[5:25:29] <Fabpsi_> that sure is something
[5:25:32] <%LastHazzerd> it's been a week, hasn't it woolie
[5:25:35] <%crybirb> @slackerunchained, GASTON
[5:25:38] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Its not just the 60fps but how clean it looks too
[5:26:00] <+pupil31> ReggieVS when pog
[5:26:02] <VidulaSaix> It had no right being as awesome as it is
[5:26:04] <BlackermanZX> Bloodborne hits different
[5:26:08] <VidulaSaix> It REALLY made me wanna replay the OG
[5:26:12] <BoneofMalkav> So different... but SO GOOD!
[5:26:13] <+CAPSLOCKlive> And we haven't even got to the Ayyyyyyyyliens yet
[5:26:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Bloodborne got the drip
[5:26:17] <peachy996> Can you see why people like me are screaming for you to play this over DS2?
[5:26:22] <andre11dr> It's a change from the previous stuff but in the best way
[5:26:23] <linSP> Goat game
[5:26:26] <%G_Thunders> Artstyles don’t just hold up, they hold up retroactively through time
[5:26:29] <+kewlmyc> Even after Elden Ring, I wouldn't be shocked if Bloodborne remains my favorite FromSoft game still
[5:26:31] <majindusto> I love the Victorian  Gothic  setting
[5:26:33] <@Menitta> Did he tell Reggie about the Health bar analogy
[5:26:34] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus theres alot more new content to Demake to go for you
[5:26:44] <+mace210> bloodborne drip TOO HARD
[5:26:49] <slackerunchained> Reggie. Watch "Le Pacte des Loup".
[5:26:50] <danknugglit> Bloodborne is such an amazing experience
[5:26:52] <andre11dr> Also this game has the best atmosphere out of all the Souls games
[5:27:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> just a fantasy knight game
[5:27:10] <+Prism_Zet> cause woolie judged the book by its cover
[5:27:11] <andre11dr> And some of the best bosses
[5:27:25] <T_Sasquatch> first time i saw dark souls It was being played by pewdiepie and it looked like SHIT
[5:27:28] <andre11dr> Also it has a really cool twist
[5:27:58] <VJdarkworld> DARK fantasy GlitchCat
[5:27:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:28:00] <velgaduere> he had not yet attained medieval insight
[5:28:01] <%ChoculaUltra> that just reminded WB totally patented the Nemesis System and literally only used it for 2 fucking games
[5:28:01] <+CAPSLOCKlive> @T_Sasquatch i was not into Dark Souls until i saw Woolie and Pat playing it, then i jumped on Bloodborne on Launch and was IN
[5:28:02] <%livlinn> Play Arceus shiaHypers I insist
[5:28:16] <VidulaSaix> The general gameplay loop is just very satisfying as well
[5:28:25] <@Solidus_113> say it with me everyone
[5:28:28] <@Solidus_113> b e r s e r k
[5:28:31] <+kewlmyc> Surprise, the game is about depression
[5:28:44] <%Juriasu> that mf is pretty cool yeah
[5:28:45] <Ipsenscastle> It's gothic fantasy. Very Gormenghast
[5:28:51] <Fabpsi_> wait, dark souls has something from berserk in it?
[5:28:51] <+sewermonk> also everybody is fucking dead
[5:28:55] <T_Sasquatch> @capslocklive only reason i bought ds2 after watching their playthrough

[5:29:14] <+Grayhammatter> BERSERK
[5:29:15] <+Reverend_Roscoe> what word?
[5:29:18] <+Bosni9> BerserK
[5:29:22] <+kewlmyc> Would you like to making fuck?
[5:29:23] <%ekodrop> kresreb
[5:29:23] <andre11dr> Kings Field are pretty bad
[5:29:25] <Boegame> Kings Fieeeeld
[5:29:33] <%Juriasu> you DARE claim that souls has berserk references?
[5:29:34] <Boegame> Its great
[5:29:46] <Sonny_Firestorm> Grasses Off, Everything is Wong (Miura died last year) FeelsBadMan
[5:30:21] <VidulaSaix> I LOVE that Bloodborne specifically calls out shield users as cowards
[5:30:24] <%Juriasu> it's more like occultism in bloodborne
[5:30:25] <+zepherl> FFXIV bored me to tears at the start because of the standard fantasy fare, i only picked up interest after i  learned about the crazy final fantasy stuff in it, especially some of the high tech stuff
[5:30:42] <+robertoszek> did that Pinocchio Bloodborne game release?
[5:30:42] <@Menitta> bullets are a suggestion
[5:30:42] <andre11dr> Elden Ring went back to Knights but in different more nordic way
[5:30:48] <iambqb> Bloodbornes magic is the funnest it's been in Soul's games
[5:30:48] <velgaduere> is it really a gun? only if you know what you're fuckin doing and build for it
[5:31:01] <+Reverend_Roscoe> buzzsaw bb
[5:31:04] <%Namillus> Did someone say GUN ONLY BLOODBORNE RUN
[5:31:06] <CappuccinoGuil> It's so weird, because everything Woolie says about BB is what I DON'T like about it
[5:31:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Ymfah begs to differ.
[5:31:27] <+Prism_Zet> gun/shotgun/flamethrower/cannon/minigun/brass knuckle lots of options
[5:31:28] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @cappuccinoguil ok, plague
[5:31:28] <+RobertWayneLewis98> All in 30 fps Keepo
[5:31:32] <danknugglit> The music
[5:31:37] <VidulaSaix> bloodborne feels like it should have release after Sekiro
[5:31:37] <VJdarkworld> fun trivia, shadow tower abyss also has GUN
[5:31:40] <VidulaSaix> Thats how good it feels
[5:31:41] <linSP> I love the game the most, but the 30 FPS makes me sad cry
[5:31:46] <+zepherl> @RobertWayneLewis98 hey now
[5:31:47] <+Grayhammatter> all in 30fps FeelsBadMan
[5:31:51] <andre11dr> Woolie pls
[5:31:52] <+kewlmyc> My only negatives about the game are the framerate and blood vial farming. That's it. It's a perfect game to me otherwise.
[5:31:54] <%Namillus> And also melancholy
[5:31:56] <%G_Thunders> I just like that Yharnam and it’s surrounding areas and lore feel cohesive, whereas Dark Souls also references places and people you’ll never see
[5:31:58] <+CAPSLOCKlive> 30fps on a good corridor
[5:31:58] <T_Sasquatch> Elden ring magic gets .... Silly. No spoilers but you guys aren't ready for the nonsense
[5:32:04] <andre11dr> That's supposed to be a twist
[5:32:07] <%ChoculaUltra> It's me, HP Lovecraft - back at it again with the fish people
[5:32:12] <blue_grave> tbh 30 fps is generous, that game runs at 28 avg for the most part
[5:32:12] <VidulaSaix> And it has probably one of the best pieces of DLC expansions to ever exist in my opinion
[5:32:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @Reverend_Roscoe I'm the weird guy who loves options and defensive, "unmovable object" play. BB, DS3 and Sekiro are too rigid, they want you to play their way or no way.
[5:32:13] <+joeyduderman> BLOODBORNE UBER ALLES!
[5:32:14] <@Solidus_113> Even max loves bloodborne. he's absolutely nuts for the game
[5:32:17] <DancesWitBalrog> dont forget: All Puppets Are Bastards LUL
[5:32:27] <+CAPSLOCKlive> When is this Demake getting Ported into Elden Ring ??
[5:32:27] <%Juriasu> I feel like elden ring i hiding some crazy shit
[5:32:44] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @cappuccinoguil fair enough
[5:32:45] <andre11dr> Elden Ring seems to be more like Norse style fantasy, maybe even Celtic
[5:32:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Discovering that genre switch was my favourite part, I wouldn't reveal that so early personally

[5:32:57] <Sonny_Firestorm> Not a fan of Lovecraftian. It's a subgenre born in outdated supersticions. Eldritch Sea monsters were just Whale dicks. (literally)

[5:32:59] <velgaduere> stream: unarchived
[5:33:02] <Fabpsi_> now getting drunk af so reggie doesn't remember at all playing bb
[5:33:04] <%ChoculaUltra> I hope Elden Ring has one of those bad endings where it zooms out and reveals it was all book Mensis was reading before he fights the Hunter from Bloodborne or some shit LUL
[5:33:10] <COStriumph> What souls game are they playing next Bloodborne?
[5:33:16] <ALT3R4T0R> I don't know why but this demake reminds me so much of LOK Soul Reaver
[5:33:17] <Ipsenscastle> The Bloodborne lore fascinated me so much, and DS lore just leaves me cold personally
[5:33:20] <VidulaSaix> Elden Ring @COStriumph
[5:33:23] <Awesome_Leaf> whale dicks are poggers
[5:33:26] <COStriumph> word
[5:33:26] <357Sneak> lytSHADES FBCatch zoneFlash
[5:33:33] <VidulaSaix> Its too close to start another one right now
[5:33:34] <+kewlmyc> Hardest part for Reggie will be unlearning some of the stuff he learned from DeS and DaS
[5:33:44] <%G_Thunders> @sonny_firestorm If it’s used well and fits in context of a story, does it matter what its origins were? Honestly asking
[5:33:46] <velgaduere> @Sonny_Firestorm I mean the superstitions are what base it in fiction and fantasy. obviously the dude's foundations are terrible, but better people have done better things with it
[5:33:51] <+mace210> yea that might fit reggie really well
[5:34:04] <Renzaku69> Bloodborne makes you fight like a beast, literally
[5:34:12] <%ChoculaUltra> despite how fucked up Bloodborne lore is, Dark Souls lore is objectively bleaker imo
[5:34:21] <Sonny_Firestorm> I mean, sure it's a good thing to have things to overcome. Problem is that in Lovecraftian settings they are seldom overcome.
[5:34:31] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's one-note.
[5:34:32] <%Namillus> @Renzaku69 You start fighting with instinct more than thought and it's sick, that's exactly how I took out the Bloody Crow
[5:34:34] <+kewlmyc> Bloodborne is such a better name. Glad they went with it
[5:34:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> fuck that guy!
[5:34:51] <VidulaSaix> There's literally no reason not to
[5:34:51] <+CAPSLOCKlive> always one guy
[5:34:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo that guy should meet with the no mods guy
[5:34:56] <BlackermanZX> wan guy
[5:34:57] <@Menitta> Nah these are dope
[5:34:58] <%waltzqueen> Literally Why Not
[5:34:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:35:00] <Sonny_Firestorm> Gameplay and memes is the only reason I like this game.
[5:35:04] <+kewlmyc> I DON'T LIKE THING!
[5:35:04] <+joeyduderman> Demakes are very fun.  2D portal was hella fun
[5:35:05] <+Grayhammatter> this is dope
[5:35:06] <velgaduere> @Sonny_Firestorm I think that bleakness fits in with Miyazaki's "Souls" take on settings. I take it you're not a fan of Souls in general?
[5:35:06] <Renzaku69> @Renzaku69 Bruh, im glad i got good dental cause i almost ground my teeth to the gums fighting the Bloody Crow. That bitch is hard
[5:35:10] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @cobalt_phoenix_ probably same guy
[5:35:13] <%ChoculaUltra> dude must be a HOOT at parties monkaS
[5:35:15] <@Menitta> 2D Portal is awesome
[5:35:17] <VidulaSaix> Isnt that just a Remaster LUL
[5:35:17] <%HeroToxiko> i bet he's a "no mods" guy
[5:35:19] <%Feralspirit41> The reason bouled down to "Why would you make a worse version of this game" Hes a chill guy things just got heated
[5:35:19] <%oneimportantthing> Was that friend a Nintendo employee
[5:35:20] <%LastHazzerd> a remaster?
[5:35:26] <Awesome_Leaf> people liking things NotLikeThis
[5:35:35] <grumblybunnys> a remake?
[5:35:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Reverend_Roscoe the true woolieONEGUY
[5:35:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> like super mario 64 in Unreal 5 with raytracing
[5:35:41] <agsiar2> aw shiet did i just miss the entire stream?!
[5:35:46] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[5:35:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @agsiar2 rip my dude
[5:35:52] <andre11dr> @choculaultra Bloodborne lore don't feel as bleak because people bring the problem on themselves, while in DS the world just sucks
[5:35:52] <agsiar2> goddammit...
[5:35:53] <@Menitta> someone is making a remake thing of Pokemon DP in Gen 5 style and it looks awesome
[5:35:53] <+kewlmyc> "friend"
[5:35:56] <+CAPSLOCKlive> The reason is that his friend is a Bitch
[5:35:57] <NickHatesSnow> Rayman Redepdition?
[5:36:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> @velgaduere To be perfectly Honest, Bloodborne was my first fromsoft game. Then I played Sekiro and next I play on buying DS1 remaster.
[5:36:06] <+MrCircleStrafe> completed bloodborne twice, would love a phone demake
[5:36:06] <@SoushinSen> No Fun Allowed
[5:36:16] <+Grayhammatter> not a single fun allowed
[5:36:20] <%ChoculaUltra> @andre11dr oh for sure. DS is just wow - everything is fucked and there is literally nothing anyone can do about it - ya wanna hollow out?
[5:36:21] <%Namillus> @Renzaku69 I was in a voice call with a friend at the time and at some point I just stopped thinking too hard about the fight and then suddenly Crow was on the floor.

[5:36:26] <Fabpsi_> just make a demakre of Pokemon Arceus with bad graphics...oh...wait
[5:36:28] <velgaduere> @Sonny_Firestorm I regret to inform you that the bleakness does not end, but I hope you enjoy yourself nonetheless
[5:36:43] <%Feralspirit41> Hes a chill guy we just got heated over it. But it boiled down to "why would you make a slower and worse looking version then a game thats already good"
[5:36:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> "I just can't help myself"
[5:36:48] <+RJay80> it just happens
[5:36:51] <VidulaSaix> Its the most asshole shit to say and I love and hate him for it LUL
[5:36:51] <Ipsenscastle> yeah DS lore is even more bleak somehow

[5:36:57] <blue_grave> man loves his swamps

[5:36:57] <+RJay80> and I can't control myself

[5:36:59] <@Menitta> he rediscovered his love of making poisonous swamps

[5:37:18] <%andrewofbob> Swamp fetish
[5:37:21] <%baka_sugoi> BLIGHT CON
[5:37:23] <%Namillus> The way Elden Ring is designed he can have MULTIPLE SMALL POISON SWAMPS WITH DIFFERENT DESIGN RULES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE MAP

[5:37:25] <+ALazo> it's so dank
[5:37:27] <%ChoculaUltra> Miyazaki confirmed for having a Shrek nendoroid at his desk

[5:38:22] <Fabpsi_> what a nice guy
[5:38:24] <andre11dr> Reggies reaction was priceless LUL
[5:38:27] <blue_grave> you fight a boss in ds2 in a poison swamp
[5:38:29] <+Bin_VV> Mans a huge masochist LUL
[5:38:35] <%ChoculaUltra> "and this one paralyzes you!" - Miyazaki, showing off his swamps like trophies
[5:38:40] <Sonny_Firestorm> Nightmare of Mensis is a Bleed Swamp BUT to make up for it you can deactivate the "swamp"
[5:38:45] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Freeze swamp
[5:38:48] <peachy996> The Nightmare Frontier where they stick a motherfucker or two in it with you
[5:38:54] <velgaduere> we applaud you for your efforts

[5:38:59] <peachy996> You know the one
[5:39:03] <%G_Thunders> @solidus_113 surely he had input in saying “don’t make it a direct sequel” though, right? ‘Cause otherwise why would DS3 be more of a direct sequel but DS2 isn’t
[5:39:05] <%oneimportantthing> @blue_grave and give you a completely out of nowhere secret way to unpoison it
[5:39:10] <+MrCircleStrafe> Miyazaki next souls game just a Shrek spin off
[5:39:13] <andre11dr> Honestly the most annoying zone in Bloodborne is Mensis because if the frenzy
[5:39:15] <+liquidzr0> shofuBlankie
[5:39:21] <@Menitta> I want the bitrate WORSE.
[5:39:28] <+Prism_Zet> i'm still kinda choked about that door in the derelict house
[5:39:31] <velgaduere> I think he was joking that "Bloodborne" was looking a little... crusty
[5:39:39] <%Namillus> Honestly I like Mensis because of the whole "move from cover to cover" angle of it
[5:39:40] <blue_grave> @oneimportantthing thankfully lol
[5:39:42] <andre11dr> Also i personally hate the forest
[5:39:47] <VidulaSaix> They MUST be doing something with it
[5:39:49] <VidulaSaix> They have to be
[5:39:49] <VincentGraves> remember that project beast trailer leak? the sickest
[5:39:51] <%waltzqueen> NotLikeThis
[5:39:53] <@Menitta> ITS STILL JUST AS BAD ON PS5
[5:39:55] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That's just because they are working that hard on Bloodborne 2
[5:40:05] <%Irridium> woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:40:06] <%Santamooo> It'll come when Microsoft buys Sony
[5:40:08] <Fabpsi_> that is cruel
[5:40:11] <Fabpsi_> don't remind me
[5:40:14] <+kewlmyc> At this point, a remake of Bloodborne is more likely than a port
[5:40:15] <@Menitta> Im still of the opinion it's When not If
[5:40:16] <Sonny_Firestorm> @velgaduere Also it's a case of story / gameplay segregation. You win in-game but "lose" in the cutscene.
[5:40:17] <agsiar2> well, it was nice being around while the stream was closing, so guess imma head out
[5:40:18] <+mace210> my brother was playing it on the PS5 and it runs the EXACT SAME :(
[5:40:22] <agsiar2> take care, everybody
[5:40:26] <%MajorCrasher> what about uncharted?
[5:40:32] <+MrCircleStrafe> or if the franchise is fead
[5:40:32] <%Irridium> And Fromsoft is doing Armored Core next so even if a Bloodborne 2 is on the cards it's gonna be a hot-ass minute
[5:40:33] <%MajorCrasher> or days gone?
[5:40:34] <T_Sasquatch> Didnt bloodborne sell like shit ?
[5:40:35] <Sonny_Firestorm> Just like with Lost Judgement
[5:40:35] <@Menitta> it's just waaaay too much money on the table.
[5:40:38] <+mace210> @agsiar2 seeya :)
[5:40:39] <VidulaSaix> I dont even want a 2. Just a good performing version
[5:40:40] <Hammatime8> Days gone came to PC, but Days Gone has NOT announced a sequel.
[5:40:43] <slipdog> Bluepoint
[5:40:43] <$MonsterEnvy> @T_Sasquatch no
[5:40:44] <%ekodrop> ask bluepoint when bloodborne 2 is
[5:40:44] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Did the guy that made it say no port because people kept asking too much? Lol
[5:40:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> or when 10 years pass...maybe. So 3 more years C O P I U M
[5:40:58] <velgaduere> @Sonny_Firestorm sure, and I'm letting you know that Dark Souls is no different. you're asked to do your best in a grave, unwinnable situation
[5:41:02] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Bluepoint WAS working on some big profile Remake wasn't it?
[5:41:02] <TigerClaws12> was it not Japan Studios?
[5:41:04] <@Menitta> it also could have to do with Japan Studio not existing.
[5:41:04] <%KetsuoTaberu> Cheer500 Been going through a really busy and stressful time, and y'alls content has really been a great place to fall back on to relax and have a great time. <3
[5:41:05] <lymund> we can just make dashy attack heal build in elden :(
[5:41:06] <+MrCircleStrafe> Sony will do it if the franchise is also dead, like Uncharted.
[5:41:06] <Artoo__The_Me> Wait they done?? I just got back tho. Hope it was fun!
[5:41:12] <%oneimportantthing> Bluepoint would make a BANGER character creator in a BB remake
[5:41:23] <velgaduere> @Sonny_Firestorm like no matter what end you achieve, no matter what your means, it sucks
