[0:26:11] <sodamin1> what a bad stat does to a mf
[0:26:24] <andre11dr> @stubborndeer I mean neither does anyone because the human body contains water
[0:26:24] <stubborndeer> no he needs water to watch the demonstrations because they are doing them in something that creates salt
[0:26:44] <dds333a> I know where to hit, but so does he
[0:26:47] <+Dakuu75> nope
[0:26:58] <@Solidus_113> Persona 4 says yes
[0:27:06] <stubborndeer> the shrine produces spirit wood and spirit clean so he needs pure water which should be called "ham-o" or "rad-o" somewhere
[0:27:16] <Ben_Lunaris> I can, because my mirror would only be a reflection, not me SeemsGood

[0:51:29] <Ben_Lunaris> That and tranformers
[0:52:01] <dds333a> as cool as Oumitsunu is, he gets unfortunately little play after his debut in Debisama
[0:52:59] <dds333a> He's great in DeSu2, however
[0:54:17] <andre11dr> His just in the Raidou games right, i don't remember seeing this guy in the other games
[0:54:40] <dds333a> He's in P3, and DeSu2, as well

[0:54:45] <%Am_Shigar00> Oumitsunu? I think he shows us in a couple games, I think he's in SMT IV at least.

[0:57:01] <%Am_Shigar00> considering how nonstop the attacks have been, I'm not surprised. Especially that mudo spam.

[0:58:11] <Jontman42> @dds333a sounds ominous
[0:59:46] <%Am_Shigar00> Man, I've missed watching this. It's making me want to continue my DS2 playthrough.
[1:00:19] <Ben_Lunaris> Where my heal bitch, I got rocked TPFufun
[1:00:22] <sodamin1> @Am_Shigar00 personally watching this makes me want to finish nocturne lol
[1:00:22] <andre11dr> One of the SMTs did that ,where you go threw a grueling boss fight beat it ,and the game throws you into more fighting without healing you
[1:00:36] <dds333a> Time for fusing, let's go
[1:00:50] <%Am_Shigar00> @Am_Shigar00 That would be a good game to finish to be sure. : D

[1:02:16] <dds333a> Here's your Ganesha reskin
[1:03:00] <andre11dr> Ganesh and the dragon gets a lot of reskin in this game
[1:04:03] <BrvldrHungryHeart> a Ganesha reskin helped a lot in SMT 1, dunno if It was shouten. bind cry was op back then
[1:04:16] <dds333a> @andre11dr Another reskin is coming up too
[1:05:08] <andre11dr> Also there's a Amaterasu reskin in this game that i just remembered
[1:05:09] <%RyuuAoi> Might be time to get back in the swing of it, Woolie, and do some off screen grindin'! Where I'm stuck at in P2: Eternal Punishment, that's exactly what's in store for me!
[1:05:51] <%Am_Shigar00> Offscreen grinding wouldn't be a bad idea. Endgame gets pretty effing brutal.
[1:06:24] <andre11dr> Get ride of the Hitori
[1:06:37] <andre11dr> That thing sucks
[1:06:40] <dds333a> if grinding were necessary for these games, especially Raidou LUL
[1:07:11] <dds333a> Naw, take your time, I find it fun
[1:07:29] <Ben_Lunaris> Required, take you're time SeemsGood
[1:07:35] <%RyuuAoi> @am_shigar00 Absolutely! Theme with most SMT and spin off games. I remember beating Devil Survivor by what felt like luck. Idk if winning like that was intended, but FUCK.

[1:08:59] <+Mekhet09> @RyuuAoi Devil Survivor has a ton of endings depending on what you do.
[1:08:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1442731253984370688?s=20
[1:09:08] <Ben_Lunaris> Did Undertale use part of the merchant music in the true lab? Sounds familiar when I played that gain earlier WutFace
[1:09:13] <+Mekhet09> I hated soul hackers though.
[1:09:16] <%Am_Shigar00> @ryuuAoi ooooh, that sounded like an experience! I've been playing through Devil survivor 2 and even with some of the free DLC advantages, some of these fights have gotten freaking brutal.
[1:09:27] <Ben_Lunaris> That'd be a pull but awesome
[1:09:58] <dds333a> The DeSu games are so excellent, it'd be neat if Woolz played those too
[1:10:03] <sodamin1> honestly, i tried to get into devil survivor but i found it way too slow for me lol
[1:10:21] <sodamin1> it'd be better if it had press turns Kappa Kreygasm
[1:10:44] <dds333a> @sodamin1 that. would be a trip
[1:10:45] <%Am_Shigar00> It honestly took me 4 tries for DeSu to finally click with me. I can totally get that.
[1:10:52] <sodamin1> plus i don't like mindless grinding either too much that it was kinda a turn off
[1:11:06] <andre11dr> I never played Devil Survivor, i just watched a friend play the first one i little
[1:11:35] <%Am_Shigar00> I've been using the "demon rescue" free DLC mission as a grinding tool. You can get a lot of levels and high rank skills way earlier than you're supposed to.
[1:11:54] <dds333a> @sodamin1 the game can get difficult, but as long as one can do the free battles in between, grinding isn't required
[1:12:12] <Qu1ckyyy> Thoth, almost FINAL
[1:12:22] <dds333a> Here we go
[1:12:30] <dds333a> SeemsGood
[1:12:35] <dds333a> LUL
[1:12:37] <Ben_Lunaris> LUL
[1:12:55] <dds333a> Look at this fire squad
[1:13:00] <%Am_Shigar00> It's always super weird to me that these earlier games often mixed together high and low level demons together in groups.
[1:13:00] <Ben_Lunaris> At least it did something this time
[1:13:12] <MadForHatters> I tried playing Soul Hackers but I got my feelings hurt when a monkey boss called me retarded and killed me. I lost a lot of progress when that happened.
[1:13:14] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh hey! Muspell! This guy's design is cool!
[1:13:22] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 it reflects the ease with which to do it in this game LUL
[1:13:35] <dds333a> There's the Surt reskin
[1:13:49] <BrvldrHungryHeart> muspel is just diet cola surt
[1:13:49] <Qu1ckyyy> Muspell has an amazing design
[1:14:03] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie so OP
[1:14:17] <Ben_Lunaris> Someone get that boi a pineapple!
[1:14:34] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi it's a sub-boss, it would be concerning if he had trouble with it LUL
[1:14:53] <MadForHatters> Woolie, please talk to Nue to start the street car pass quest ;_;
[1:15:05] <%Am_Shigar00> Surt's getting a major role in SMT V if I remember. Looking forward to that.
[1:15:25] <%RyuuAoi> @dds333a Yeah but that took like less than a minute. Our boi is BEEF ha
[1:15:51] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 long time coming, too, he had major roles in only really SMT I and III
[1:16:16] <%Am_Shigar00> oh yeah, he was a boss in SMT III, wasn't he. I remember having trouble because I had a terrible team for him.
[1:16:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:16:22] <dds333a> @madforhatters not here LUL
[1:16:52] <Ben_Lunaris> Know the moon loser TPFufun
[1:16:52] <MadForHatters> @dds333a He'll say he has something stuck in his teeth but won't give you anything. THen, in Raidou's real world, that Nue will give you the pass
[1:17:12] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh yeah, this guy is just a regular enemy now.
[1:17:17] <kingra> GASHADOKURO PogChamp
[1:17:32] <%Am_Shigar00> I actually completely forgot he was a boss early on until watching Woolie's playthrough
[1:17:38] <dds333a> @madforhatters oh. I wasn't aware that was the prerequisite, I just though you had to go back there
[1:17:57] <dds333a> I must've done so unconciously LUL

[1:27:51] <Ben_Lunaris> Trolley cars are heavy
[1:27:57] <cosmov06> Good podcast!
[1:28:00] <%Am_Shigar00> Fate has really caused me to look at some of these demon characters in a very different light.
[1:28:22] <andre11dr> Scathach ,definitely one of my favorite demons
[1:28:23] <%Am_Shigar00> I can't help but imagine Scathach with either two speaks or a little magic wand.
[1:28:24] <MadForHatters> I wish Wu Kong got used more

[1:31:38] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine coming back to society and having to catch up on decades of history that you're skeptical of monkaS
[1:31:57] <+Dakuu75> Dudes were padding their KDA AFTER the match ended
[1:32:02] <%Am_Shigar00> I can't imagine what sort of PTSD that would give to a person, fighting a war for decades of your life you never realized was already finished.
[1:32:07] <thelivingglitch307> kinda like bushido?
[1:32:14] <dds333a> yup
[1:32:24] <Qu1ckyyy> FIghting who tho?
[1:32:24] <%baka_sugoi> FOR HONOR
[1:32:28] <+vaderxyz1970> And then they took that dedication from the Army to Ceo's and companies like Toyota
[1:32:49] <+Dakuu75> no new orders or comunication for decades?
[1:33:00] <%RyuuAoi> Kamikaze pilot energy
[1:33:27] <andre11dr> They where trained in a way where they basically believed that the emperor was a holy and thought they where literally fighting for God
[1:33:43] <Ben_Lunaris> Your life for your Emperor.
[1:33:43] <dds333a> @andre11dr exactly
[1:33:44] <%Am_Shigar00> Adapting back into society must have been a horrible experience. If they even could.
[1:33:50] <+Dakuu75> So woolie just listens to WWII podcasts for fun? Ok. Mr. intellectual over here.
[1:34:17] <dds333a> that was just a part of the Hardcore History thing

[1:35:02] <andre11dr> But then they got hit with a bomb
[1:35:11] <andre11dr> A VERY BIG bomb
[1:35:20] <%baka_sugoi> twice
[1:35:20] <dds333a> TWO

[1:38:48] <DSD24> He's rad in Nioh 2 as well
[1:39:01] <MadForHatters> I always hated the encounter rate in this game. Even with Nocturne the repulse skills actually majorly reduce the encounter rate.
[1:39:08] <+Dakuu75> "catch you on the flip-side man"
[1:39:10] <%Am_Shigar00> I'm still miffed some of the cooler demons like Yoshitsune were locked to fusion accidents in SMT IV.
[1:39:29] <dds333a> @madforhatters as has been said before in chat several times LUL
[1:39:32] <DSD24> @Am_Shigar00 Yeah that was a bummer SMT4 had some weird shit
[1:39:43] <dds333a> the encounter rate for this game is its biggest failing
[1:39:51] <MadForHatters> @dds333a I've never been in chat before

[1:40:15] <dds333a> @madforhatters oh no, I wasn't saying that about you. I was saying in general

[1:43:09] <andre11dr> Nue is such a huggable demon
[1:43:15] <MadForHatters> He's so lucky the Muspell is weak. I got nervous when he picked Nue xD
[1:43:28] <%Am_Shigar00> I would love to hug a Nue, assuming I can guarntee it doesn't chew my head off.
[1:43:28] <Ben_Lunaris> Need a Nue plushy
[1:43:44] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:43:46] <%Am_Shigar00> Really, every demon needs a plushy. ESPECIALLY Mara.

[1:45:59] <Gmanblack> That summon gives me hella Onimusha vibes
[1:46:09] <Ben_Lunaris> Time for fun
[1:46:17] <%Am_Shigar00> I want a jack frost plushy. I had a chance to get the Raiho plush with a physical copy of DS2 at a game store once and I completely let it slip me by.
[1:46:21] <+Mekhet09> Into the car.
[1:46:34] <Ziegsy> @MadForHatters ziegsyHoo ziegsyHoo ziegsyHoo
[1:46:54] <MadForHatters> @Am_Shigar00 Oh nooo... That one's really rare now. You can still find some of the newer Jack Frost plushies on Yahoo Japan or Japanese Mercari
[1:46:57] <Ben_Lunaris> He'll figure it out..Eventually..
[1:47:06] <dds333a> yep, eventually LUL
[1:47:43] <%Am_Shigar00> oh shit, Susano-o! I forgot he was here!
[1:47:51] <MadForHatters> YESSSSSSSSSS SUSANO-O
[1:47:55] <dds333a> Susano'o, the QUINTESSENTIAL Japanese god
[1:48:00] <Ben_Lunaris> Kreygasm
[1:48:23] <kingra> Sissy is cowardly
[1:48:34] <+Mekhet09> But he's a moon god.
[1:48:51] <dds333a> And, more popularly, a storm god
[1:48:52] <Ziegsy> WILD AND PURE, AND FOREVER FREE!
[1:49:09] <Ben_Lunaris> Full moon during the game right now SeemsGood
[1:49:14] <%Am_Shigar00> nice!
[1:49:59] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:50:07] <%Am_Shigar00> man, Woolie just STOMPED that boss!
[1:50:28] <dds333a> I mean. Sasuke got bodied LUL
[1:50:47] <dds333a> Woolie had an easier time with him than Oumitsunu
[1:50:52] <Ben_Lunaris> Woolie feeling the true power of combos PogChamp
[1:50:59] <%Am_Shigar00> To be fair, Oumitsunu is genuinely kind of a bitch to fight.

[1:52:53] <%ozzrabbit> I Lothar fact that someone had the balls to fire a cannon a castle to get Japan to open trade negotiations.
[1:53:08] <%ozzrabbit> Love*
[1:53:50] <Gmanblack> Sounds like propaganda yea
[1:53:54] <dds333a> You can live that code, even today
[1:54:01] <dds333a> they would say
[1:54:43] <andre11dr> Don't tell them that Samurai where huge assholes
[1:55:12] <Gmanblack> Oh god no
[1:55:14] <dds333a> Exactly, that is reflected in this game, too
[1:55:40] <enerkaizer> wasn't that also the reason one of the russian royalty allmost got beheaded whil he stayed in Japan and nothing really happened because of it?
[1:55:42] <dds333a> So is the Army and Navy rivalry sometimes documented
[1:55:55] <%Am_Shigar00> I love the distinction between nearly 30000 yen and 1 for a twig.
[1:56:21] <dds333a> It's the definition of a wicked tapestry
[1:56:32] <Ben_Lunaris> Well anyone can get a twig
[1:56:43] <andre11dr> They don't like eachother
[1:57:20] <%RyuuAoi> For England, James?
[1:57:38] <Gmanblack> it would imply that they weren't capable of controlling their own men
[1:57:46] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi Perfect LUL
[1:58:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> Don't forget that the Japanese military was so power-hungry that they launched a coup attempt against the Emperor when he tried to surrender in WW2
[1:59:18] <Ben_Lunaris> Intelligent warriors are too dangerous in a war

[2:00:00] <enerkaizer> good ol classy fanatiscim, can never go wrong
[2:00:04] <skullnaught> it was basically a military junta
[2:00:09] <%RyuuAoi> @thomasoftroy That's not his history. Woolie is Irish! woolieSMUG
[2:00:13] <andre11dr> I like how Woolie knows this stuff but then he says shit like "Remember the muskets in WWI?"
[2:00:26] <+ThomasOfTroy> @RyuuAoi True LUL
[2:00:29] <+WeLucklessJacks> Which podcast did you say to listen to about this Woolie?
[2:00:31] <dds333a> Talking to many of the army personnel also reveals that many of them are psychos LUL
[2:00:32] <Crowroost> Indulgences
[2:00:34] <+Dakuu75> "Nothing is true... everything is permitted..."
[2:01:18] <dds333a> In this game, I should clarify
[2:01:21] <+pupil31> SPOOPY
[2:01:23] <Ben_Lunaris> I'm sure The Emperor will be okay with this..
[2:01:27] <%Am_Shigar00> walks?
[2:01:35] <Fxcknips> yoooo
[2:01:40] <%townzzzzz> hungry for battle
[2:01:41] <Crowroost> BATTLE HUNGER
[2:01:46] <dds333a> Yeah, it's a kaiju sized skeleton
[2:01:46] <Gmanblack> LUL
[2:01:57] <andre11dr> Btw ,the giant skeletons from Dark Souls are based on this dude
[2:02:21] <MadForHatters> Imagine being Raido coming down to the Gouma-Den and seeing his charts all messed up because Victor thought Raidou was him
[2:02:24] <dds333a> she also had a son, Shiva cut his headoff, and he had. to get an elephant to replace the head,
[2:02:35] <Ben_Lunaris> Died hungry, beefy in afterlife Kappa
[2:02:37] <%Am_Shigar00> God, that's true! This technically isn't our Victor!
[2:02:42] <+pupil31> Power PogChamp
[2:02:45] <dds333a> YEYEYE
[2:02:56] <dds333a> I carried power through the rest of the game
[2:03:05] <+pupil31> I love the angel designs in SMT
[2:03:08] <%RyuuAoi> BAYO SHIT
[2:03:15] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh man, it's weird seeing Power at such a high level. I'm so used to him being around 20s-30s.
[2:03:18] <andre11dr> Sadly Power is not as good as you think
[2:03:51] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 Throne comes before Power in this game too
[2:04:06] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a Good LORD, that is true. That is freaking weird.
[2:04:23] <andre11dr> Principality look cool as hell im SMT
[2:04:36] <andre11dr> Basically just the liberty statue
[2:04:47] <MadForHatters> He's held onto Car for way too long xD
[2:04:48] <dds333a> @andre11dr fact LUL
[2:05:15] <andre11dr> OH SHIT
[2:05:18] <dds333a> @madforhatters it's extremely easy to do in this game LUL
[2:05:26] <andre11dr> I just saw sword boy
[2:05:44] <thelivingglitch307> never let go of car, it's too hilarious
[2:06:17] <%Am_Shigar00> I remember having a Turdak and Moh Shuvuu in my endgame team in this game.
[2:06:19] <dds333a> get em drunk
[2:06:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1442731253984370688?s=20
[2:06:22] <Ben_Lunaris> Max car instakill finale boss Kappa
[2:07:09] <+l3sovikk> Hello, everyone!
[2:07:09] <andre11dr> I think i finished this with Lilith
[2:07:35] <+l3sovikk> mothComfy
[2:08:00] <+pupil31> monkaS
[2:08:01] <andre11dr> I had Lilith, Shiva, Vishnu ,and i think Beepzebub
[2:08:05] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[2:08:06] <+pupil31> Cow Bride monkaS
[2:08:12] <MadForHatters> I'm trying real hard to think who I had end game. Are Metatron or Sandalphon in this game? I swear I finished with an angel on my team
[2:08:13] <skullnaught> OH
[2:08:25] <MadForHatters> Shit, this is a rare encounter
[2:08:29] <dds333a> @madforhatters the latter
[2:08:29] <Ben_Lunaris> Another waifu appears Kreygasm
[2:08:31] <MadForHatters> I wish I could help ;_;
[2:08:34] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:08:38] <skullnaught> wow
[2:08:40] <rosemon5001> demon was about to be a fully cow style boss but last second saw a super model
[2:08:43] <%RyuuAoi> Kill the abomination!
[2:08:50] <MadForHatters> I think it's only weak to Force
[2:08:52] <+Mekhet09> Kudan is lie a special encounter.
[2:08:52] <andre11dr> Absorbs phis
[2:09:05] <dds333a> absorb guns
[2:09:20] <MadForHatters> Ooops, I remembered wrong.
[2:09:31] <MadForHatters> It's gonna run soon, though, I think
[2:09:33] <dds333a> see ya
[2:09:33] <MadForHatters> Yup
[2:09:35] <Ben_Lunaris> Lack of commitment is it's weakness LUL
[2:09:37] <Qu1ckyyy> Oh not that sfx
[2:09:42] <2deep5u> IIRC it killed itself and reset one of my personas to level 1 in P1, it does something really dumb according to my memory
[2:09:46] <+pupil31> Bride ran away BibleThump
[2:09:48] <andre11dr> It ram
[2:10:01] <andre11dr> You have to spec for it
[2:10:12] <andre11dr> Better lighting required
[2:10:13] <enerkaizer> every RPG needs its metal slime it seems LUL
[2:10:34] <dds333a> @2deep5u Kudan? nah
[2:10:55] <MadForHatters> Kudan is super easy to beat once you're a higher level and know its' weakness
[2:11:10] <Ben_Lunaris> High DPS for a bride SeemsGood
[2:11:15] <dds333a> @madforhatters all of its several weaknesses LUL
[2:11:44] <2deep5u> "Prophecy : Sacrifice self to reduce all enemy Personas to rank 1."
[2:11:58] <2deep5u> it's in innocent sin, apparently, and not P1
[2:12:00] <MadForHatters> @dds333a It's been a really long time. For Kudan does it change up where it's weak to one random thing every encounter? I really thought the one I remembered fighting didn't like Force.
[2:12:16] <enerkaizer> to be fair, SMT is propably the RPG that actually realies on the players using the stat buffs/debuffs to beat higher difficulty bosses
[2:12:21] <Ben_Lunaris> What else are you gonna use the bullets on Woolie?
[2:12:37] <dds333a> @madforhatters it's weak to all the elements and death, it's a war of attrition, but you know that
[2:12:38] <AlphaRayAllen> SMT naming conventions do be like that
[2:12:39] <2deep5u> makara has to do with magic
[2:13:03] <dds333a> It's a really shitty buff
[2:13:18] <andre11dr> @2deep5u Oh yeah that stupid fucking spell that d-ranks your Personas in P2
[2:13:28] <andre11dr> Forgot about that shit
[2:13:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:13:36] <dds333a> @2deep5u  remember now, thanks
[2:14:06] <dds333a> Yeah, Kudsn was significantly rare, I only found it in the factory
[2:14:25] <andre11dr> Some people say P2 is a great game
[2:14:35] <dds333a> It is LUL
[2:14:44] <MadForHatters> @dds333a I'd have to check my guide but I thought, in one particular chapter, you can find it a lot in town.
[2:14:46] <dds333a> they both are LUL LUL
[2:14:51] <+Mekhet09> Airplanes also had notorious death rates.
[2:14:54] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[2:14:55] <andre11dr> I beat it ,it definitely has great moments
[2:15:04] <%Am_Shigar00> I need to play P2 again at some point. It seemed really interesting, but I got bored at the school.
[2:15:07] <AlphaRayAllen> woah
[2:15:08] <dds333a> @madforhatters my bad, I was referring to P2 Kudan, my apologies
[2:15:23] <MadForHatters> Oh. Ooops.
[2:15:25] <%Am_Shigar00> Loved fighting the teacher with the giant wrench on the clock tower though. That was hilarious.
[2:15:29] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr I'm stuck! But I know I'm near the end. I can feel it!
[2:15:33] <AlphaRayAllen> Like a die now or die later situation? That's fucked
[2:15:36] <dds333a> P2 has a factory as a bonus dungeon, where you find Kei Nanjo
[2:15:50] <Ben_Lunaris> I mean alot of the planes back when we're pretty much car engines shoved into a winged car
[2:15:50] <andre11dr> But boy P2 gameplay has some shit in it ,that makes me ask, wtw where you guys smoking LUL
[2:16:10] <+Mekhet09> The biggest problem is the encounter rate.
[2:16:16] <dds333a> @andre11dr yeah, no doubt about that LUL
[2:16:20] <%Am_Shigar00> It's an interesting relic of a pre-SMT III era to be sure.
[2:16:21] <MadForHatters> I started playing SMT games on the PS2. I tried going backwards to play the older games but I suck too much
[2:16:32] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr You played both parts?
[2:16:49] <andre11dr> I tried 1 and was FUCKING NOPE
[2:16:55] <%Am_Shigar00> My first SMT was the PSP version of Persona 3 followed by SMT IV. Good times there.
[2:16:58] <andre11dr> Not doing that shit
[2:17:38] <vaderxyz1970> Kerberus!
[2:17:46] <+Dakuu75> home depot skeleton
[2:17:46] <andre11dr> I'd rather play Strange Journey with that dungeon design again
[2:18:21] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr Persona 1 on the PSP was amazing! I got the bad end at first and immediately started over from the beginning and beat it! That was a fucking journey and a half!
[2:18:41] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi did you do Snow Queen too?
[2:19:06] <dds333a> Like the Death Anchor LUL
[2:19:11] <%Am_Shigar00> I really want to play original Persona 1 at some point, just to see how TERRIBLE that localization is.
[2:19:12] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr You did P2: Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment?
[2:19:16] <+pupil31> RIDE THE BOMB-ING
[2:19:22] <MidnightPacif1c> yahoo
[2:19:43] <%RyuuAoi> @dds333a No I didn't! Was too hype to get into 2! Did I miss something good?
[2:19:58] <andre11dr> @ryuuaoi Innocent Sin was the first i beat
[2:20:00] <+Dakuu75> how dedicated to the guild are you? Will you delete your character for this raid?
[2:20:24] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi I think you're fine, but it is a neat addition, really focused about St.Hermelin and everything
[2:20:28] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr Hell yeah!
[2:20:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:20:30] <andre11dr> Then i looked up the differences in EP
[2:20:46] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:21:12] <andre11dr> I can't believe how they censor him in EP ,he looks so ridiculous LUL
[2:21:45] <dds333a> all this fusing reminds me that I have never seen the fusion accident in this one
[2:21:52] <MadForHatters> I wish someone would do a video pointing out differences between the original US Nocturne release and the Remaster. I feel like I'm the only one who remembers the original text in some areas
[2:21:59] <%RyuuAoi> @dds333a Nice! Might jump back in before I start 3 if I can beat Eternal Punishment! Really getting PUNISHED RN.
[2:22:04] <%Am_Shigar00> Do fusion accidents happen in this one? I know I've seen them once or twice in 2.
[2:22:11] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:22:13] <dds333a> @madforhatters DUDE, I get you
[2:22:17] <MadForHatters> @dds333a I saw it once. It nearly killed Victor and my demon was the same with higher stats
[2:22:20] <+pupil31> I played Battlefield 1 dude
[2:22:33] <%RyTYoung> Take me back to the "Get into Kiting Games" arc NotLikeThis
[2:22:35] <@Solidus_113> CoD and BF are not anything about historical moments lmao LUL
[2:22:39] <dds333a> @madforhatters oh. is that what happens LUL
[2:22:54] <cosmov06> World at war got me covered
[2:22:55] <%RyuuAoi> @dds333a That demon fusion shit in 1 was complex as shit! Idk how I made it work, but I did. Ha
[2:23:02] <@Solidus_113> Tell me what happened on D-Day again
[2:23:08] <Ben_Lunaris> History is interesting SeemsGood
[2:23:09] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi LUL LUL
[2:23:10] <andre11dr> Learning history trew Cod seems really fucked
[2:23:11] <MadForHatters> @dds333a It's the only way you can get a Legion in this game. I kept trying but never got it to happen. Your chances are higher in a Full Moon but I still didn't get one.
[2:23:22] <rosemon5001> i know how you joke about that but there is a suprising amount of people that learn about war shit from games
[2:23:42] <dds333a> @madforhatters I knew that. yeah, and all it's different types, but i never saw it with my own eyes
[2:23:51] <andre11dr> Like they literally ignore Vietnam in the Cod games, it's like "nope what are you talking about"
[2:24:22] <dds333a> That Nebiros was a sub-boss, but yeah, he got ventilated
[2:24:50] <andre11dr> Also that Highway of Death shit is disgusting
[2:24:59] <+Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus in all seriousness, thasnks for sharing this info woolie. Pretty interesting
[2:25:10] <andre11dr> They literally changed history because it made the US seem evil
[2:25:14] <%RyuuAoi> Hiroshima was a mistake, man.
[2:25:21] <%kyh9> what are we talking about?
[2:25:47] <+pupil31> SourPls
[2:25:48] <dds333a> Woolie is recounting a lot of interesting WWII knowledge he picked up
[2:26:11] <%Am_Shigar00> woops, we lost our healer.
[2:26:23] <+KaguraRaion> SourPls
[2:26:29] <dds333a> there goes the battery LUL
[2:26:34] <Ben_Lunaris> Castle Super Beast Podcast: Woolie vs WWII
[2:26:34] <%RyuuAoi> GAME OVER YEAH
[2:26:45] <%Am_Shigar00> stuff like that is why I appreciate being able to choose what to pass down in modern SMTs, even if it can homogenies the demons a bit.
[2:26:48] <andre11dr> Wait did Woolie really have only one healer?
[2:26:50] <cosmov06> Always hates the persona UI in these games
[2:26:53] <enerkaizer> I still think its wild that Jack Kirby actually needed police protection because a lot of people in the US  hated how Cap knocked adolf out on the cover of his debut issue.
[2:26:54] <andre11dr> OMG
[2:26:56] <Ben_Lunaris> RIP, F to pay respects NotLikeThis
[2:27:10] <%Am_Shigar00> it happens.
[2:27:28] <Carlioo> I blame WW2 for this
[2:27:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:27:29] <%RyuuAoi> You legit HAVE to have a healer. Two sometimes
[2:27:30] <Ben_Lunaris> Time to catch a healer
[2:27:34] <dds333a> @cosmov06 it's the Persona UI before Persona LUL
[2:27:35] <%Am_Shigar00> stuff like that is exactly why I kept Moh Shovuu in my party. She was always a consistant source of Dia.
[2:27:36] <+secretspud> wait, this isn't turned based?
[2:27:46] <+secretspud> I've never seen this game actually played
[2:27:49] <%Am_Shigar00> @secretspud Nope, it's an action RPG.
[2:27:56] <+secretspud> oh fuck
[2:27:57] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> WaitHowDidIGetHere subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[2:28:00] <andre11dr> I usually roll around with at least 3 healers
[2:28:21] <dds333a> also all of these games have so much visual style. extremely strong aesthetic on every menu
[2:28:47] <dds333a> cmonBruh
[2:29:07] <FordR> FordR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! These games always piqued my interest. Thanks for going through them!
[2:29:18] <Qu1ckyyy> Oukuninushi carrying this LP
[2:29:19] <Ben_Lunaris> Buy you're waifu Woolie!
[2:29:26] <andre11dr> This why you make a skill monkey demon
[2:29:32] <MadForHatters> All the SMT games released on the PS2 were worth buying
[2:30:06] <%Am_Shigar00> It's impressive how many they managed to pump out for the system. Even the 3DS library is like half originals, half ports.
[2:30:16] <andre11dr> Like in Nocturne i usually throw all the final cure and heals on a Pisaca that i never use in battle
[2:30:23] <+pupil31> Graphics looks amazing too for PS2 era
[2:30:42] <dds333a> @andre11dr not to mention the one for sale LUL
[2:30:42] <MadForHatters> @Am_Shigar00 It's crazy how good P4 was after how fast it was released after P3
[2:31:08] <+KaguraRaion> SourPls
[2:31:18] <dds333a> At least this game encourages the expenditure of items, if only because Raidou can only carry nine of em at a time
[2:31:45] <dds333a> I'm still prone to selling that Bead tho LUL
[2:32:02] <%Am_Shigar00> @MadForHatters I remember hearing it's practically a mod of 3 in how similar they are on a development level. That's kind of insane for how good and distinct it is.
[2:32:21] <Ben_Lunaris> Reggie get Woolie a spreadsheet LUL
[2:32:35] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 I've read that too

[2:42:51] <%Am_Shigar00> Multiplayer would actually be pretty cool in this game.
[2:43:10] <dds333a> One crazy thing tho, is that many if the demons in this game are legit voiced, by actual people
[2:43:11] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie, gonna spin "Alive 1997" after the stream today. Join me!
[2:43:12] <+fetrigon> ah
[2:43:30] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:43:31] <@Solidus_113> but it has to be the old fake multiplayer, where just plugging in a 2nd controller gives you control of the demon
[2:43:33] <+vaderxyz1970> My favorite elephant noise comes from the Zoids Elephander
[2:43:36] <andre11dr> Wait why Alive 97 tho?
[2:43:37] <+pupil31> WRAAAAARGHHH
[2:43:38] <Ben_Lunaris> A co-op option woud be cool, each player could control a summon

[2:50:05] <dds333a> @mekhet09 correct, albeit not in this game
[2:50:23] <andre11dr> @mekhet09 Not here tho
[2:50:24] <dds333a> P2, with something like seven categories for physical LULphysical
[2:50:26] <thelivingglitch307> that day on the 9th month?
[2:50:26] <%Am_Shigar00> They're pretty all over the place with how to treat physical in these games.
[2:50:36] <+fetrigon> wait was that Esperanto???
[2:50:41] <dds333a> Havoc is a great in P1 and P2
[2:51:04] <+fetrigon> did the monkey say? Saluton?

[2:52:11] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:52:17] <%Am_Shigar00> check standard inventory maybe?
[2:53:11] <+MrKerb> MrKerb subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! The sub baby is due
[2:53:45] <dds333a> the game WILL do that too LUL
[2:53:59] <%Am_Shigar00> such is the nature of reusing map layouts.

[2:55:55] <thelivingglitch307> was that a waekness?

[2:56:12] <Ben_Lunaris> I hate being weak to death WutFace
[2:56:13] <%Am_Shigar00> To be fair, this whole sequence of events is honestly kind of a pain.
[2:56:23] <andre11dr> I can just check, what is he called again?
[2:56:31] <%Am_Shigar00> @Ben_Lunaris It's a common weakness to be sure.
[2:56:58] <dds333a> @andre11dr what, Shouten? Woolie knows (I hope)
[2:57:25] <thelivingglitch307> being strong to life however is not as common
[2:57:35] <%Am_Shigar00> I keep on seeing "Shouten" and confusing it with "Shuten", which is a very different demon.
[2:57:37] <andre11dr> Ok got it ,it is infact death
[2:57:47] <dds333a> Orochi time

[3:11:23] <+pupil31> LUL oh my god
[3:11:23] <%RyuuAoi> WE DO IT
[3:11:24] <alroy900> wait, he still doesn't realize the jack frost was healing it?!
[3:11:27] <%Am_Shigar00> Jack frost were the healers
[3:11:27] <MadForHatters> It's killing me Woolie still didn't figure it out
[3:11:31] <dds333a> no, he still hasnt figured it out
[3:11:33] <dds333a> LUL
[3:11:34] <MadForHatters> YES
[3:11:39] <%Am_Shigar00> there we go.
[3:11:48] <Qu1ckyyy> What a traitor
[3:11:48] <andre11dr> Oh he never saw it
[3:11:48] <Ben_Lunaris> Nope, he killed it as an accident SeemsGood
[3:11:49] <+pupil31> I'm dying here bro LUL
[3:11:51] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:11:52] <dds333a> The same jack frost he spoke to LUL LUL
[3:12:09] <MadForHatters> You got hee-trolled
[3:12:11] <Ben_Lunaris> He got it now
[3:12:15] <%Am_Shigar00> That's actually some clever foreshadowing.
[3:12:17] <Carlioo> tbh I can see how he brainwormed himself into that
[3:12:28] <andre11dr> WOOLIE FIGURED IT OUT
[3:12:31] <dds333a> First try tho HSWP
[3:12:54] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:12:56] <%Seancicle> PokCroagunk woolieVS woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:13:19] <%Seancicle> So I pushed him
[3:13:21] <@Solidus_113> sounds like an assumption to me
[3:13:24] <Ben_Lunaris> Healers are important Woolie TPFufun
[3:13:52] <%Am_Shigar00> God, I'm getting flashbacks to the cleric adds from Tokyo Mirage Sessions superboss. Jesus christ that was horrifying.
[3:14:06] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:14:10] <dds333a> Damn. Oumitsunu and Orochi making Susan look like a bitch
[3:14:16] <Ben_Lunaris> Healers that come with any boss usually suck
[3:14:20] <andre11dr> If anything will lie to you ,it's SMT
[3:14:52] <Ben_Lunaris> The Mind Goblin stand LUL
[3:14:57] <dds333a> @andre11dr DDS1 Has an exceptionally vicious lie too LUL
[3:15:17] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a oooh boy, gonna look forward to that once I get around to that game.
[3:15:30] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:15:55] <andre11dr> @dds333a I really hope Woolie gets around to playing that obe day, i need to see that LUL
[3:16:15] <brisk_dacat> Wouldn’t fighting be different in another universe?
[3:16:16] <Ben_Lunaris> Reggie has the right idea SeemsGood
[3:17:05] <dds333a> @brisk_dacat really weird to think about too. the game actually does do somethin towards explaining it in ONE zone, that's it
[3:17:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:17:07] <Ben_Lunaris> Depends on if you're a main character I think
[3:18:23] <MadForHatters> I'd really like to see Woolie unlock the Beelzebub fight near end game.
[3:18:27] <dds333a> the second biggest dick in the franchise LUL
[3:18:53] <%Am_Shigar00> I've never actually done the Beelzebub fight in this game. I never got to high enough level.
[3:19:24] <MadForHatters> @Am_Shigar00 It's just kind of annoying because you have to go through this 100 demon gauntlet before he'll show up.
[3:19:28] <andre11dr> @am_shigar00 I did ,grinded like hell tho
[3:19:50] <%Am_Shigar00> @MadForHatters I did do the gauntlets to get the items to fight him. Oooh boy those were a pain.
[3:20:19] <%RyuuAoi> Play the game, Woolie!
[3:20:19] <+pupil31> BibleThump
[3:20:24] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 shoutouts to wave after wave of Nue, Neko, and Utai LUL
[3:21:19] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a GOD, do not remind me. Ended up dying to petrification at least once or twice before I beat it.
[3:21:20] <andre11dr> Well at least you get to summon him after you beat him
[3:21:45] <andre11dr> Which made the last zone really trivial
[3:22:14] <%Am_Shigar00> I can imagine. Isn't he like the highest level demon in the game?
[3:22:19] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 much easier with RB or AB, but I sure didn't have that first go LUL
[3:22:42] <+s_xylocalsingles> @WoolieVersus New streamer Meta dropped ; Screencap saying you can pay to boost Streams and show it recommended to people
[3:22:58] <andre11dr> @am_shigar00 Yeah he's pretty much one of the best demons in the game
[3:23:10] <%Am_Shigar00> fantastic, to be fair he usually is.
[3:23:20] <andre11dr> Resists like everything
[3:23:42] <MadForHatters> Yeah, in Nocturne I always rock Beelzebub and Metatron.
[3:24:10] <%Am_Shigar00> @MadForHatters That was my team + Dante when I did True Demon end in the HD version.
[3:24:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:24:13] <MadForHatters> Death Flies is such a cheap, but awesome move xD
[3:24:31] <andre11dr> Fusing Metraton is a pain tho
[3:24:40] <MadForHatters> @Am_Shigar00 Same except I tried out Raidou
[3:24:42] <dds333a> A big pain LUL

[3:25:32] <xeros720> *gasp* you mean we have to develop unique content?!
[3:25:33] <dds333a> especially just doing it solo dolo with fusing LUL
[3:25:36] <@Menitta> all of Assassins Creed
[3:25:40] <xeros720> but seriously, videogames would probably cost more
[3:25:56] <@Solidus_113> What is life if not a million fetch quests
[3:26:05] <Sapphire_Breeze> magic 2x4
[3:26:09] <dds333a> you'll see it some more LUL
[3:26:11] <%Am_Shigar00> I remember Beelzebub was a NIGHTMARE to beat because I didn't have any insta-kill prevention on my party, so I had to use all my Tetraja Rocks. Ended up using all of them right before I beat him.
[3:26:12] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:26:33] <+froduck42> go wave your de-sexing stick at them

[3:27:05] <xeros720> "the what russian guy? oh fuck."
[3:27:11] <MadForHatters> I can't remember if the funniest cut scene in the game with Rasputin is next chapter or not
[3:27:13] <dds333a> noc dialogue actually answers this question LUL
[3:27:20] <dds333a> *npc
[3:27:40] <%Am_Shigar00> Bye Raido, you were cool despite not really doing anything.

[3:28:43] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a "My job is done." "But you didn't do anything!"
[3:28:49] <MadForHatters> Baphomet shows up in Woolie's house
[3:29:00] <Ziegsy> 'my name is also...'
[3:29:00] <andre11dr> @am_shigar00 He does stuff in Devil Summoner, at least i hear
[3:29:07] <rosemon5001> Kris about to tap woolies shoulder whit the chanting
[3:29:09] <dds333a> @madforhatters LUL LUL
[3:29:15] <%LastHazzerd> well that was interestin'
[3:29:23] <%Am_Shigar00> @andre11dr He is a pretty sick boss in Soul Hackers, so that's something.
[3:29:28] <dds333a> @rosemon5001 GOD DAMNIT
[3:29:34] <Ziegsy> so was that chapter filler?
[3:29:45] <dds333a> @ziegsy somewhat
[3:29:45] <Qu1ckyyy> The STICK
[3:30:02] <dds333a> love this mix
[3:30:09] <%Am_Shigar00> "Be prepared for ANOTHER irrelevelnt chapter!"
[3:30:22] <%Am_Shigar00> If this was an anime, they'd totally do that for a filler arc.
[3:30:42] <xeros720> can't believe you screwed up the words woolie
[3:30:47] <dds333a> cowardice LUL
[3:30:50] <+vaderxyz1970> Why you make monkey sad
[3:30:55] <MadForHatters> It seems like Raido isn't as good of a summoner as Raidou considering how scarred up he is and he's got a penis demon after him in the sequel you have to help him with
[3:31:05] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:31:06] <rosemon5001> in these types of cases if you dont have a waypoint to go back to your exact world you possably could never know
[3:31:09] <%ChoculaUltra> sometimes filler can be good tho - like the baseball episode in Samurai Champloo
[3:31:11] <%RyuuAoi> WTF, WOOLIE.?
[3:31:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1442731253984370688?s=20

[3:31:53] <%RyuuAoi> Let monkey express himself. BibleThump
[3:32:16] <dds333a> LUL
[3:32:29] <andre11dr> Don't let the monkey express itself
[3:32:34] <dds333a> you know it
[3:32:43] <andre11dr> Unless you want to clean monkey jizz
[3:32:44] <Qu1ckyyy> You don't have telepathy with your friends?
[3:33:06] <%RyuuAoi> @andre11dr LUL
[3:33:29] <Ziegsy> the monkey hands you a finger painting of the two of you it made out of its own shit. it smiles, expecting praise
[3:33:47] <dds333a> That was the glass shop too :(
[3:33:52] <MadForHatters> You guys are mean, Thoth is actually one of my favorites xD
[3:34:14] <Qu1ckyyy> ah mou
[3:34:21] <+KaguraRaion> Ahmoooo
[3:34:36] <andre11dr> Thoth is probably the lamest of the Egyptian gods
[3:35:03] <MadForHatters> @andre11dr True, but he is pretty useful in this game. But I fused mine so he had better skills.
[3:35:30] <dds333a> Narumi :( :( :(
[3:35:33] <andre11dr> His not even supposed to be a monkey, but i guess they didn't want to make ANOTHER wierd burd
[3:35:40] <Uncle_Christian> Wouldn't Pharaoh be the weakest of Gods since Pharaoh was mortal?
[3:36:14] <Uncle_Christian> PAWS?
[3:36:17] <dds333a> six months to be precise
[3:36:20] <andre11dr> @uncle_christian We all know the Pharaoh was just a poser
[3:36:21] <%Am_Shigar00> wait.
[3:36:37] <dds333a> you find Kaya and Rin as NPCS
[3:36:38] <Uncle_Christian> Cleopatra can pose for me anytime.
[3:36:57] <topiodonk> this game really gives the itch to play some old ps2 jrpgs
[3:36:59] <dds333a> it WAS an alt universe, but also six months ago
[3:37:09] <drunken_lemur> WHAT
[3:37:15] <Uncle_Christian> PS2 is the golden age of Games
[3:37:30] <Ben_Lunaris> Time Paradox
[3:37:31] <%Am_Shigar00> Huh, I never noticed that "past" detail before.
[3:37:46] <Uncle_Christian> What is Woolie and Reggie going to be for Halloween?
[3:37:47] <MadForHatters> PS2 was my jam. I bought the most games for that system. These days I mostly buy ports and remasters of older games.
[3:37:49] <+vaderxyz1970> You could say Rasputin is a Knight
[3:37:53] <%Am_Shigar00> I guess that makes sense considering other plot details later on.
[3:38:10] <andre11dr> @uncle_christian White Face

[3:39:58] <%Am_Shigar00> @MadForHatters That's crazy. yeah, I was a Nintendo kid growing up. Didn't really get into other systems until a generation later and didn't get a PS system during it's current run until the PS4.
[3:40:08] <Uncle_Christian> Cat shrine?Catnip

[3:41:13] <MadForHatters> I'm so bummed I can't find my guide to look up titles because I can't find them listed online.   I had the Double Jump guide for Devil Summoner
[3:41:16] <Ben_Lunaris> You didn't know, how would they?
[3:41:18] <Qu1ckyyy> Now they are teared apart forever
[3:41:18] <%LastHazzerd> if you can't handle a little temporal/universal displacement, you don't deserve the title
[3:41:31] <rosemon5001> this what happens when you dont tag your MCs whit a tracking  chip

[3:46:04] <Carlioo> huh!
[3:46:05] <xeros720> you don't see it much until later, but that's always in the background of ff14
[3:46:10] <@Menitta> FFXIV? Isnt that the MMO with the free trial?
[3:46:19] <dds333a> XIV also has some ethnic cleansing thrown in
[3:46:29] <@Solidus_113> that goes up to lvl 60 and includes the hit Heavensward expansion, with no restrictions on playtime?
[3:46:30] <@Solidus_113> yes
[3:46:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait which one was the XIVth? gaius, or the guy from HW
[3:46:58] <%RyuuAoi> Acknowledge it so it never happens again.
[3:47:17] <@Solidus_113> and yes the XIVth Legion is Gaius's unit
[3:47:18] <Ben_Lunaris> Every country has it's fucked up shit that makes for good games
[3:47:23] <andre11dr> Yeah later on in XIV you learn that the empire are doing their shit because "fuck those other races" literally
[3:47:43] <dds333a> It's quite complicated
[3:47:56] <dds333a> understatement, I know
[3:48:05] <Uncle_Christian> America ordered so many purple heart medals for the Invasion of main land Japan the country is still taking from that order
[3:48:44] <Brandon__Brando> hardcore history has a whole series on ww2 japan haven't finished it but im sure it go's into it
[3:49:04] <dds333a> I've heard if this being called "shocked into surrender"
[3:49:10] <Uncle_Christian> ^^^
[3:49:25] <Uncle_Christian> the Japan culture would be lost
[3:49:35] <%RyuuAoi> "Illmerica"
[3:49:37] <emeraldskrull> tony soprano voice: It's a complicated situation
[3:49:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so somehow pulling the lever made the trolley do crazy shit, but less people died still so it's ok
[3:49:52] <dds333a> @emeraldskrull LUL
[3:50:14] <+vaderxyz1970> It was either that or use bats with napalm bombs attached to them
[3:50:16] <%LastHazzerd> so either way civilians would have been killed en masse
[3:50:17] <+Dakuu75> and we have bombs that are 100's of times stronger now.
[3:50:19] <andre11dr> They looked at it and decided that it was better to trow that bomb because if we keep fighting on foot this war might take 3 more years
[3:50:23] <Ben_Lunaris> No one wins in a war, not even the victor.
[3:50:27] <%Deft_Thought> Death by "conventional" warfare is something people are conditioned to expect
[3:50:30] <dds333a> Hardcore History: narrated by James Gandolfini
[3:50:54] <Uncle_Christian> Death before dishonor
[3:51:04] <Brandon__Brando> ww2 japan was insane its so interesting
[3:51:23] <%Deft_Thought> But it's weird to exclude the influence of Russia's pressure on Japan from the conversation
[3:51:24] <Brandon__Brando> the mentality
[3:51:36] <andre11dr> The Rath of Khans is still my favorite of the Hardcore History
[3:51:39] <dds333a> whatever it takes
[3:51:40] <Uncle_Christian> Germany surrendering to America was a blessing compared to the Russians
[3:51:41] <+Dakuu75> jesus fuck
[3:51:44] <+vaderxyz1970> They also put their belief structure on other cultures such as enemy combatants
[3:52:05] <%Deft_Thought> @Brandon__Brando That's fascism for you
[3:52:13] <Uncle_Christian> Imperialism
[3:52:26] <Ben_Lunaris> Slitting the throat instead of burning to death
[3:52:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:52:26] <andre11dr> Well Americans did burn a bunch of people to death in the east
[3:52:36] <dukenux> afaik Stalin was about to start the offensive on Manchuria, which at this point would certainly fall out of Japanese hands
[3:52:47] <Uncle_Christian> Woolie will you be a Dad soon?
[3:52:49] <thelivingglitch307> The only winners of war are the people who call the shots and recieve public support and praise, before and after.
[3:52:58] <dukenux> whether or not that would bring *unconditional* surrender, is up to discussion
