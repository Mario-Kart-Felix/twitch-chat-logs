[0:00:01] <leith_aziz> To be fair, some character arcs details can play INTO the gameplay, its called Ludonarrative synchronicty. For example, in Xrd Axl accepted his powers and became comftorable with using them. And now in Strive, he can use it in gameplay, showing that he's gotten used to his power

[0:01:29] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I actually agree. The gameplay should characterize your characters and make you intruiged. That should happen DURING gameplay first and foremost

[0:03:22] <Applecannon63> Melty Blood another game bringing back 2D fighters
[0:03:24] <leith_aziz> Apparently Melty Blood was PC exclusive ? And now the sequel has no PC port planned ? Doesnt this alienate the fanbase ?
[0:03:38] <tabletopsandpowerbottoms> @gatorafan lmao yeah the villains are WAREZ

[0:04:15] <leith_aziz> That game is not on PC. You should get it
[0:04:16] <OldManDeckardCain> melty blood was never a pc exclusive LUL
[0:04:22] <%gatorafan> Phantasy Star Portable is alright daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:04:23] <dds333a> Yeah
[0:04:24] <+Mordexai0> dot hack//versus is fun
[0:04:28] <DaKnightWarrior> There's SO MUCH on the PS3
[0:04:31] <leith_aziz> RC collection....
[0:04:33] <+krispen_wa> DISSIDIA
[0:04:34] <@Menitta> It hasnt been announced yet
[0:04:35] <leith_aziz> Im F-ed
[0:04:40] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Jim Ryan doesn't care
[0:04:42] <Applecannon63> rip Disgaea 3/4 PS3
[0:04:42] <+krispen_wa> CRISIS CORE
[0:04:45] <leith_aziz> *R&C
[0:04:48] <dds333a> It was going to go away sooner or later, but yeah, they're just gonna get rid of them
[0:04:57] <dds333a> sucks, man
[0:04:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Quoted from Jim Ryan HIMSELF: "Who would want to play/buy these old games?"
[0:05:11] <%ggbhtg> we're in the jungle, baby
[0:05:12] <+Mordexai0> ACTUALLY someone is making an English translation of Hack Versus so....
[0:05:12] <leith_aziz> Same goes for the GOW trillogy
[0:05:14] <odd_slater> There's a backpat rumor floating around for PS5 but I don't have hope
[0:05:15] <OldManDeckardCain> @Applecannon63 laughs in physical copies of both on vita
[0:05:19] <+krispen_wa> tbf psp is super easy to emulate, but ps3 is a fucking oof
[0:05:21] <@Menitta> Jim Ryan can't say that when Sony sells fucking GOW3 on PS4.
[0:05:40] <@Menitta> I hate it so much
[0:05:46] <Super_Voltekka> A B A N D O N W A R E
[0:05:47] <@Solidus_113> PSNow
[0:05:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh god, TTT2, Grab that as well
[0:06:01] <dds333a> @odd_slater man, I hope, but I doubt it
[0:06:01] <leith_aziz> @Menitta But about the first two ? the PSP ones ?
[0:06:04] <+Jiggisnipe> hopefully emulation gets there at some point and people have a reason to really try now
[0:06:08] <Applecannon63> BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
[0:06:19] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I have the discs for ultimax
[0:06:23] <Applecannon63> but Sony is like nope
[0:06:28] <leith_aziz> Hope that one gets a re-release with rollback
[0:06:28] <%Zero_Jacks> not gona lie. i emulate it for ease of access
[0:06:37] <+krispen_wa> I can run Dark Souls 3 and sekiro but my pc shits itself with ps3 demon souls
[0:06:39] <leith_aziz> Otherwise, they can make a P5A
[0:06:39] <@Solidus_113> Ultimax is on 360, so it has a higher chance of geting XseX back compat
[0:06:41] <OldManDeckardCain> "Damn, why are people pirating our games"
[0:06:49] <odd_slater> ^^***
[0:06:50] <@Menitta> P4AU for sure. Dengeki Bunko is there but there's a newer version that people are adding rollback to
[0:06:55] <phatmac16> dengeki
[0:07:03] <Estuko> Dissidia :( I have the psp physical copy still hhh
[0:07:03] <dds333a> All those ps2 SMT games
[0:07:11] <leith_aziz> Fes, Portable and.....
[0:07:12] <@Menitta> @Solidus_113 I'm pretty sure they stopped adding 360 games to backwards compat
[0:07:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> JUST SUB TO PS NOW STOOPID Kappa Kappa
[0:07:15] <Applecannon63> P3P…
[0:07:18] <+krispen_wa> P3P...

[0:07:44] <OldManDeckardCain> I'm so glad I didn't sell my phycial copies of vita and psp games lol
[0:07:56] <Super_Voltekka> Any Abandonware needs to be preserved on the Internet Archive ASAP
[0:08:01] <@Solidus_113> Gran Turismo PSP and Rock Band Unplugged are two very good PSP games
[0:08:02] <leith_aziz> Man, have you forgot about our issue with PS2 games too ?
[0:08:06] <Super_Voltekka> Like with the Ouya
[0:08:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:12] <+Superbro64> blame sony for being dumb and doing cell architecture with ps3
[0:08:14] <leith_aziz> We still dont have a lot of games from PS2
[0:08:23] <Applecannon63> Oh no even one of the nippon ichi games and vanillawares
[0:08:23] <dds333a> yeah, people were hopeful that newer consoles would hold on longer than the generations of 30 years ago, but shit keeps disappearing
[0:08:28] <Estuko> @OldManDeckardCain Same, I have some favorites on there still like peace walker, birth by sleep, FF, and dissidia lol and of course.. Third Birthday
[0:08:30] <leith_aziz> But yes, the PS3 is so hard to emulate I hear
[0:08:32] <+krispen_wa> if only pcsx2 wasnt such a shit emulator
[0:08:36] <+FuqBoiSlim> Does this mean I gotta go get a bigger vita memory card to re-download all my shit now gigaboOtsMJOW1

[0:11:51] <+TungstenViper> Melty Blood rollbacked into existence
[0:11:52] <NotHereToStream> Sion died for rollback

[0:11:54] <phatmac16> NO SION
[0:11:58] <leith_aziz> More games with rollback
[0:12:02] <+Jiggisnipe> @gatorafan they aint afraid of nothing
[0:12:04] <%Buttface_> @gatorafan those are all upcoming games, TFH is already out
[0:12:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Custom Color creator too!~
[0:12:06] <phatmac16> SION SACRIFICED FOR MY ROLLBACK
[0:12:07] <+krispen_wa> Sion isekai'd to UNIST for rollback
[0:12:07] <%andrewofbob> SG - “who are you”. MB - “I’m you but better”
[0:12:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Mordexai0
[0:12:15] <OldManDeckardCain> roa was in the tsukihime novel iirc so he ill be there?
[0:12:18] <TigerClaws12> No PC because of DFCI rollback salt?
[0:12:19] <leith_aziz> ASW are aware of GGPO to now
[0:12:20] <dds333a> good, all my homies hate Sion
[0:12:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Even better!
[0:12:30] <phatmac16> Roa will be in the game
[0:12:33] <wibbwobbler> rollback included thats so good
[0:12:36] <%ggbhtg> Inject Rollback right into the crust
[0:12:37] <+Mordexai0> Asuka 120% is also coming back with THREE GAMES
[0:12:39] <phatmac16> This game was done a long time ago
[0:12:39] <Applecannon63> Sion is living in Unist
[0:12:42] <leith_aziz> Didnt it start with Strive ?
[0:12:47] <%Buttface_> @tigerclaws12 the official reason is because nasu's "creator ego" wants it to be on a big screen
[0:12:50] <phatmac16> It jus took the VN forever to come out
[0:13:00] <dds333a> All my homies love Chaos
[0:13:00] <%gatorafan> it's a whole new world out there for fightans daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:13:01] <leith_aziz> Same with +R I presume ?
[0:13:13] <TigerClaws12> @Buttface_ so it's a yes LUL
[0:13:17] <leith_aziz> Though ASW did help the modders
[0:13:20] <%Buttface_> yes Kappa
[0:13:21] <leith_aziz> So thats nice
[0:13:23] <+krispen_wa> NRVNQSR
[0:13:28] <@Menitta> It was bootleg as hell
[0:13:41] <@Menitta> but it worked so eh
[0:13:41] <%Mathochism> Did someone say NRVNQSR?!?
[0:13:50] <dds333a> Specifically, C.Chaos
[0:13:53] <leith_aziz> You could at least do what Arcsys did and HIRE/HELP the modders
[0:13:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> NRVNQSR Gang
[0:13:58] <phatmac16> DID SOMEONE SAY NERO CHAOS
[0:14:01] <BlackermanZX> SFV doodStare
[0:14:01] <tacostarvedbeast> how much is that props to dedicated fans vs anti props to japanese game devs?
[0:14:02] <%alexisofthestars> Melty Rollback
[0:14:02] <leith_aziz> You just make it an official patch
[0:14:02] <+patrickng714> Capcom did an update to prevent rollback in SFV
[0:14:09] <phatmac16> HE MAY NOT EVEN BE IN THE GAME THO
[0:14:09] <OldManDeckardCain> the only reason I bought melty on steam was t support frenchbread
[0:14:21] <dds333a> @phatmac16 true, KEKW
[0:14:39] <fernanda_ps2> no

[0:47:42] <%Grimlockfly> We did it
[0:47:46] <+The_Death_Owl> Harada said don't ask him for legacy titles
[0:47:51] <%Grimlockfly> 10 out of 10 would recommend
[0:47:57] <+Prowtellen> If I were my 10 years old self with a GBA only I'd probably love that game
[0:48:01] <%X2Eliah> Big ups for BBBABBBBBBABB
[0:48:03] <%ggbhtg> Next time, Woolie is gonna dig up Tekken Revolution
[0:48:09] <Flare3500> I mean there are PSP Tekken 5 and 6
[0:48:10] <%ggbhtg> or Tekken 2 POV mode
[0:48:11] <Tracazoid> That was better than it deserved to be, like that one Power Ranger live action movie a few years back
[0:48:12] <OldManDeckardCain> I'd rather play tekken advance than tekken 4 and 6 LUL
[0:48:20] <%Grimlockfly> woolieONEGUY_BE
[0:48:22] <dds333a> Truth
[0:48:26] <$razielhex> I mean, I played Streets of Rage II on Game Gear and loved it because it was the only Streets of Rage I had
[0:48:26] <TheAlmostBlind> what's next? that card gameboy game?

[0:52:06] <@Menitta> I think Rival Schools should come back. That could succeed today
[0:52:12] <Applecannon63> I will never forgive what Sega did to Eternal Champion
[0:52:12] <+Superbro64> Why did the sony make the vita to release no sony games for it? Kappa @woolieversus

[0:52:35] <makeiks_rv> New rival schools would be sick
[0:52:36] <dds333a> Some people would VEHEMENTLY disagree
[0:52:37] <blackkanye> @gatorafan Ah thanks for letting me know. I dodn't keep up with twitter too much
[0:52:40] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Felicia wouldn't make it back the same

[0:52:49] <Applecannon63> make it a 2D drawn fighter like Skull Girls
[0:52:49] <dds333a> I would be okay, I guess
[0:52:52] <@Solidus_113> You'll get your single Rival Schools character in Street Fighter and you'll LIKE IT
[0:52:54] <+Zanzibar_Junker> She's practically naked
[0:52:54] <%birddotexe> BB Hood deserves to be in another game
[0:53:07] <+The_Death_Owl> no one is old enough to remember Darkstalkers in it's prime. outside of Morigan it's a new ip to most people
[0:53:08] <%ggbhtg> Let's NOT bring back doing advancing guard with UP TO 6 buttons

[0:56:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> shermie Kreygasm
[0:56:51] <JohnXuandou> this game is actually great
[0:56:52] <brunoberserk> the ps2 version ??? why not the xboxlive version ? @WoolieVersus
[0:56:53] <Super_Voltekka> The best version of Lee Pai Long
[0:56:55] <+Mordexai0> THAT'S JUST KOF THOUGH
[0:56:57] <Qsmash_> weird concept for a game considering KOF is already SNK vs SNK
[0:56:58] <%Alazull> Alazull subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Big grats to Reggie for getting through Demon's Souls. Looking forward to the journey going forward! Thanks for all the entertainment dudes.

[0:57:02] <%X2Eliah> What is this artstyle
[0:57:02] <+patrickng714> @geltonz there was room for improvement
[0:57:06] <dds333a> OG Athena
[0:57:07] <jetjagger222> aggressors of dark kombat
[0:57:09] <@Menitta> I like those two OCs
[0:57:09] <357Sneak> lytOMG
[0:57:12] <makeiks_rv> @GeltonZ I asked Itsuno for a port with the datesim translation is the minimum :v
[0:57:12] <JohnXuandou> KoF is a crossover game!
[0:57:14] <%trustycoyote> I think the Ikari Warriors are in here somewhere
[0:57:14] <@Menitta> they look cool
[0:57:15] <dds333a> MUDMAN
[0:57:16] <blackkanye> I like the OCs Kappa
[0:57:18] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:57:18] <auso912> wasn't KoF origianlly intead to be SNK vs SNK?
[0:57:20] <+mMayrro> NO ESCAPE
[0:57:20] <+TopTieramisu> way better than maximum impact's OCs
[0:57:21] <@Solidus_113> SNK School
[0:57:22] <+patrickng714> @meltgar Abe and Dart right?
[0:57:24] <GeltonZ> @makeiks_rv Yes.
[0:57:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:57:26] <tacostarvedbeast> why is the main dude just anime egoraptor?
[0:57:30] <dds333a> Well, yeah. kof is a crossover fighter
[0:57:31] <+VariantX7> it being better than Capcom Fighting Jam is a correct assessment...but most things including a punch to the jaw are better than CFJ
[0:57:34] <@Menitta> New Geography
[0:57:38] <%ggbhtg> costumes of the main characters, yesh
[0:57:44] <%X2Eliah> Ohhhh that is definitely a ..... design for th main menu.
[0:57:47] <jetjagger222> yeah true, kamen rider dude and sports gal are pretty good compared to the goobers from MI or ingrid
[0:57:47] <@Solidus_113> nice art
[0:57:49] <JohnXuandou> there are secret characters as well
[0:57:49] <$razielhex> tong fa rue

[0:57:54] <%jinking79> Fuck Goodman
[0:57:56] <@Menitta> the art is really nice yeah
[0:58:00] <Meltgar> @patrickng714 Yeah, those "apparently" were good to go, but then hell happened.
[0:58:06] <keogamer> glade xbox still has this available
[0:58:06] <brunoberserk> no secret characters unlocked ?
[0:58:07] <GeltonZ> I love this game. It's the closest we got to a console version of SNK vs Capcom: Match of the Millenium until that Switch port.
[0:58:10] <+TopTieramisu> KOF kind of got its own identity with its own storylines. it's hard to just call it an SNK mashup at this point
[0:58:16] <auso912> portraits looks good
[0:58:17] <+Suneater_Jerome> man I remember playing this on ps2, no idea wtf I was doing tho haha
[0:58:26] <@Menitta> Shocker this game looks good

[1:01:46] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Doesn't Kyo have a Max Mode install in this game?
[1:01:46] <+patrickng714> whos the chick between Jubei and SamSho ref in background here?
[1:01:48] <JohnXuandou> the short dash is important because you can't block immediately after running, but you CAN block immediately after the short dash

[1:02:28] <deafmelone> kyo does have max mode install yes
[1:02:33] <JohnXuandou> no hops
[1:02:36] <%ggbhtg> it ain't Kyo without some Otou
[1:02:37] <JohnXuandou> this is not KoF
[1:02:40] <blackkanye> I can only think of that MUGEN Kyo taking pictures with his phone
[1:02:42] <JohnXuandou> there are no rolls either
[1:02:54] <%ggbhtg> I wonder if the command list has universals listed
[1:02:55] <Applecannon63> Iori's clan name was originally Yasakani but because of swearing with Orochi they called themselves Yagami
[1:03:13] <%ggbhtg> hoo boy
[1:03:16] <%ggbhtg> that's a move list
[1:03:17] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Hi, Woolie, Hi Reggie~!
[1:03:24] <dds333a> @patrickng714 it might be Shiki
[1:03:31] <jetjagger222> wow terry looks weird
[1:03:33] <Applecannon63> 182 shiki baby~
[1:03:34] <%jinking79> team supers look cool but does booty damage
[1:03:40] <+Shmario> chat which console they re playing this game ?
[1:03:42] <leith_aziz> Im still baffled by SNK inputs. Like why arte they like that ?
[1:03:48] <leith_aziz> *are
[1:03:55] <%ggbhtg> @leith_aziz because they are
[1:03:58] <deafmelone> he got a super from rekka
[1:03:58] <dds333a> @shmario PS2, I believe
[1:04:02] <+the22cstomp> you mean quarter and half circles??
[1:04:03] <leith_aziz> ooh
[1:04:07] <+the22cstomp> oh no i have to roll it
[1:04:16] <TigerClaws12> that looks like SFEX
[1:04:20] <+mMayrro> @jinking79 the tag super thing is mostly for removing recoverable health
[1:04:20] <Super_Voltekka> Some characters have special D-Assaults depending on who you pair them up with
[1:04:24] <+Shmario> feels diferent than ps 2 version...i played the ps 2 version
[1:04:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:04:30] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Set life to Red too, probably
[1:04:31] <Super_Voltekka> Kyo has one with Iori
[1:04:31] <DomonTrigger> I would like to get hit by Kyo and Iori's D-Assault
[1:04:33] <DedlokPM> DA MAX
[1:04:38] <%jinking79> booty damage
[1:04:46] <dds333a> There are some really neat ones
[1:05:00] <+mMayrro> also some teams have special tag supers
[1:05:00] <Applecannon63> oh yeah isn't Kyo's move called Final Shiki?
[1:05:03] <QuietSandshrew> usercl143
[1:05:11] <+Shmario> oh! might be xbox 360
[1:05:16] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's move?
[1:05:23] <Super_Voltekka> Wicked Chew LUL
[1:05:27] <QuietSandshrew> jaboodyBruh
[1:05:29] <IceyCone> ah his wicked chew rekkas
[1:05:36] <jetjagger222> oh no the 90s jank translated moves
[1:05:39] <Applecannon63> that Rekka ender super?
[1:05:51] <+Shmario> this xbox version sound its way beter than the ps 2 version
[1:05:54] <JohnXuandou> that's talking about Anywhere Juggle, even if they reset and fall out of the juggle, Anywhere Juggles still combo
[1:05:55] <dds333a> @super_voltekka yup, translated. it's either that or Wicked Bite
[1:06:04] <oAznoUta> somebody calm down that light
[1:06:06] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's DM that creates the fire pillar and then a big aragami is Mushiki
[1:06:10] <TreeLeafBoi> is that an Akuma reference?
[1:06:18] <dds333a> Then Dokugami becomes Poison chew, or Poison bite
[1:06:31] <deafmelone> start with heavy rekka
[1:06:35] <mrpandabear437> does he have qcf k in this?
[1:06:44] <dds333a> Also can't forget about Ya Otome becoming MAIDEN MASHER
[1:06:49] <SNK_Dan> Ahoy there
[1:06:55] <JohnXuandou> can he do DP in the air?
[1:06:58] <brunoberserk> wrong one
[1:06:58] <BlackermanZX> is there kyo double kicks
[1:07:30] <JohnXuandou> this gives him KoF02 MAX mode
[1:07:33] <brunoberserk> this oone
[1:07:37] <deafmelone> its wicked chew ii
[1:07:38] <Super_Voltekka> I love canceling Wicked Chew into Poison Bite over and over
[1:07:56] <+0neReeler> bodega
[1:08:05] <brunoberserk> starts with the strong rekka
[1:08:19] <Applecannon63> Heavy Rekka input?
[1:08:20] <deafmelone> its with strong punch
[1:08:24] <+0neReeler> 234 hp
[1:08:37] <IceyCone> heavy punch, not light punch
[1:08:39] <%ggbhtg> this style of move list with THESE names, just ain't hitting right

[1:09:16] <+0neReeler> oh it's new
[1:09:18] <QuietSandshrew> jaboodyPray believe
[1:09:22] <deafmelone> do heavy rekka twice
[1:10:06] <BlackermanZX> is it poison bite
[1:10:14] <+0neReeler> this is the 02 rekka
[1:10:17] <QuietSandshrew> Recitation of Sins WTF jaboodyS

[1:11:37] <+TopTieramisu> that kick is a unique followup to NLBC, right?
[1:11:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1374386271892606990
[1:11:43] <+TopTieramisu> in*
[1:11:48] <brunoberserk> the last one is qcb
[1:11:59] <QuietSandshrew> KOF Spirtes are Spectacular
[1:12:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BODY GA-
[1:12:05] <JohnXuandou> NGBC shares an input interpreter with KoF03 and XI, also known as the worst input interpreter in KoF history
[1:12:28] <usurper_sos> Need to do more grinding offscreen
[1:12:29] <+OblivionSword1> we got it on camera that's what counts
[1:12:33] <leith_aziz> Rock's sprites are some of my faves. Gotta thank ABItorial for that
[1:12:34] <QuietSandshrew> We getting it
[1:12:39] <brunoberserk> @JohnXuandou worst than neowave ?
[1:12:42] <SomersaultJustice> have they used marco yet
[1:12:47] <Applecannon63> man I hope KoF15's Kyo have this hidden super
[1:12:49] <JohnXuandou> I think Neowave also uses this input interpreter
[1:13:00] <+Shmario> @Applecannon63 its not even a super
[1:13:01] <QuietSandshrew> Shermie is my fav, plz be in 15
[1:13:06] <QuietSandshrew> jaboodyPray
[1:13:29] <SNK_Dan> Shermie is def in XV
[1:13:29] <+0neReeler> practically confirmed unless they mess up the newface team
[1:13:31] <dds333a> @quietsandshrew she's all but confirmed
[1:13:36] <+TopTieramisu> monkey's paw: shermie's back but she has no hair bangs
[1:13:46] <Applecannon63> of course shermie is gonna be in there because of Yashiro
[1:13:50] <IceyCone> yashiro's in so it's almost certain shermie will be
[1:13:51] <BlackermanZX> thats a sick move
[1:13:58] <DomonTrigger> I wont be satisfied until we get more Heavy D
[1:13:58] <SNK_Dan> SNK posted a picture of Yashiro with a cropped Chris and Shermie lol
[1:14:01] <%jinking79> gonna hate Chris in it
[1:14:10] <dds333a> the only other team Shermie has been on is Orochi Ladies, and that's an edit team. CYS are always together
[1:14:11] <%Afterman_> that folding screen is going crazy
[1:14:20] <+TopTieramisu> heavy D is unironically cool af
[1:14:21] <QuietSandshrew> No Shit! Im Excited
[1:14:22] <$emptyantics> I just hope we get a grown up Chris that resembles orochi and is no longer a teenqger
[1:14:25] <+0neReeler> chris but without CD Kappa
[1:14:26] <BlackermanZX> they should add that move in XVI
[1:14:40] <+TopTieramisu> it helps that he's the only team USA fighter that doesn't have a joke fighting style
[1:14:54] <+Crunchy_the_clown> You can dp after it in the corner
[1:14:55] <leith_aziz> Can't wait to see Duck King revealed. The memes inbound
[1:14:56] <%ggbhtg> dopeness
[1:14:56] <+Crunchy_the_clown> twice
[1:15:03] <+0neReeler> coolest is his punch supers (which look meh in 15)
[1:15:04] <deafmelone> costs meter tho
[1:15:07] <SNK_Dan> I wish SNK would give Terry Quick Burning back ;-;
[1:15:13] <leith_aziz> Its pretty cool
[1:15:15] <Applecannon63> Man how less Shota are they going to make Chris cause if they don't make it I'm disappointed
[1:15:16] <+Crunchy_the_clown> Love this game
[1:15:23] <%ggbhtg> tag supers...
[1:15:28] <+TopTieramisu> mushiki is kyo's best move
[1:15:35] <+TopTieramisu> in terms of hype
[1:15:37] <+0neReeler> Shermie knee
[1:15:38] <%ggbhtg> UNIQUE tag supers, rather
[1:15:41] <DomonTrigger> Terry has Hidden Power in this game right
[1:15:55] <%ggbhtg> Kyo and Iori got a unique tag super
[1:16:04] <%ggbhtg> as you do
[1:16:06] <rusell4> Unique teams
[1:16:17] <%ggbhtg> Try this, Reg? https://strategywiki.org/wiki/NeoGeo_Battle_Coliseum/Walkthrough
[1:16:19] <+Shmario> @WoolieVersus is this XBOX360 Version ?
[1:16:21] <dds333a> Shermie with Irish Whip, my goodness
[1:16:22] <JohnXuandou> step does not cost a bar unless you cancel into it
[1:16:25] <Super_Voltekka> Ryo and Robert's D-Assault is great
[1:16:29] <deafmelone> they tell you who has them in the move list
[1:16:40] <DedlokPM> NO ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE
[1:16:41] <+0neReeler> forgot think the step mechanic breaks the game.. or was that svc
[1:16:56] <+TopTieramisu> i love her fighting stance
[1:16:57] <JohnXuandou> WAREZ
[1:16:58] <%ggbhtg> war dot ez
[1:16:59] <linSP> WAREZ
[1:17:00] <%ggbhtg> for sure
[1:17:05] <+RyTYoung> OH NO
[1:17:05] <dds333a> With Goodman, as it's CEO
[1:17:06] <leith_aziz> "Can't escape from crossing fate"
[1:17:06] <+678saintglock> i don’t care what anyone says that’s a cool ass character design
[1:17:07] <Applecannon63> Honestly Kyo's best moves are his Divine dust super/Iori's Maiden Mash-like super and his KoF13 Max cancel
[1:17:10] <+cubbywolf> HEROZ

[1:17:27] <cj_art> i love ai's idle animation
[1:17:27] <+0neReeler> zoomer "what's warez"?
[1:17:42] <auso912> this probably SNK's headcannon as to why they weren't beating Capcom too lol
[1:17:47] <deafmelone> this game takes place in 2017 lol
[1:17:47] <JohnXuandou> Warez is what us internet boomers used to call file hosting sites
[1:18:00] <Super_Voltekka> Ai and Yuki are walking talking nods to SNK's history
[1:18:00] <%ggbhtg> SNK with all these inputs, nobody ever told them to stop when they should've
[1:18:00] <JohnXuandou> people would come together to share pirated materials
[1:18:11] <+TopTieramisu> snk and capcom were never on even footing as companies
[1:18:11] <+0neReeler> shenwoo?
[1:18:23] <auso912> so this guys are just the piracy police lol
[1:18:26] <Super_Voltekka> Ai's crouching animation is great

[1:20:50] <+0neReeler> maybe slightly better than new kof lead
[1:21:03] <SNK_Dan> Yuki and AI would be neat in KOF XV
[1:21:12] <dds333a> And hell, we already had Neo and Geo as "kinda" console mascots

[1:22:57] <AndreDahMan> I actually like his black gi
[1:22:58] <SomersaultJustice> look at that pop in
[1:22:59] <LoreKeeper_Thal> 98 stance is the best one
[1:23:13] <leith_aziz> Why is there an older version of Ryo ?
[1:23:18] <JohnXuandou> Mr. Karate can chain cr.B into cr.C, no link required
[1:23:19] <+0cash> his portrait art looks great
[1:23:20] <Super_Voltekka> Getting Ocean Hunter vibes with this stage
[1:23:26] <leith_aziz> I feel like they should just have this version for XV
[1:23:31] <HelluvaNohbody> The Stages in this game are awesome
[1:23:37] <usurper_sos> BURNING
[1:23:40] <+0neReeler> art of fighting timeline
[1:23:44] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Ryo has appeared in layer games outside of AOF, so this is a nod to that
[1:23:53] <leith_aziz> Ah, Kim's pants.......
[1:23:56] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Art of Fighting takes place 10 years before Fatal Futy
[1:23:56] <auso912> the 3d stages aged like a fine milk :/

[1:25:51] <Applecannon63> Kaede is just Rock Howard with a Sword
[1:25:54] <leith_aziz> Is Gauro and KOF connected ? Or is that Gauro and Fatal Fury ?
[1:26:06] <dds333a> @leith_aziz the latter
[1:26:06] <JohnXuandou> Kaede can't be Rock with a sword he's actually good
[1:26:08] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:26:11] <auso912> GOOGLY EYES
[1:26:11] <GeltonZ> @leith_aziz Garou is Fatal Fury. KOF is an alternate canon.

[1:26:37] <jetjagger222> oh shit grant looks awesome too
[1:26:37] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus the 360 version they corrected some sprites
[1:26:38] <JohnXuandou> Hotaru is top 1 in this game also
[1:26:42] <cj_art> do that one special move hotaru has pls :]
[1:26:44] <auso912> typical SNK "we wasted all the budget on the stages, so ask your cousins to do the sprites again"
[1:26:58] <jetjagger222> kaede's sprite is new too
[1:27:05] <+ChadosOnTwitch> Have I missed King of the Monsters?!
[1:27:09] <+patrickng714> @auso912 still more effort than Capcom Fighting Jam
[1:27:10] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's orochinagi looking kinda smol
[1:27:21] <leith_aziz> @GeltonZ Thats a shame, since Gauro ends on a cliffhangher (Rock follows his uncle to find his mom)
[1:27:21] <+Shmario> use that girl from agressors of dark combat ..i guess her name was Kisarah ?
[1:27:23] <JohnXuandou> the 360 version is not bad but it has forced filtering
[1:27:24] <usurper_sos> a paltroon?
[1:27:30] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The 360 version has less/worse stages and the improved sprites are kinda weird.
[1:27:37] <Super_Voltekka> Kaede with the Bugs Bunny words LUL

[1:29:27] <SNK_Dan> I think Geese was the first LUL

[1:29:29] <+0neReeler> goenitz with the meterless supers
[1:29:30] <AndreDahMan> Kaiser wave
[1:29:31] <auso912> why the F would they grab a iconic boss and change his name to bob?
[1:29:36] <JohnXuandou> KoF bosses get real bad in NESTS where they start cheating
[1:29:39] <+TopTieramisu> goenitz and krizalid weren't as bad as the others

[2:11:59] <naomi_artlady> I like these sprites though, damn they look nice
[2:12:01] <+captain_history> i don't think that's Wakamoto, I think that's Nakata Jouji
[2:12:04] <%Mathochism> And Bullwinkle?
[2:12:07] <michaelpolandwatcher> getting strong now.. gonna fly now
[2:12:10] <@Menitta> I assume with this being PS2, there won't be any parsec online
[2:12:28] <+Shmario> @Menitta its on XBOX 360
[2:12:37] <andre11dr> Goodman for KOF XV DO IT COWARDS
[2:12:45] <@Menitta> they're playing the PS2 version
[2:12:54] <+OblivionSword1> aren't they playing the ps2 version ?
[2:12:56] <Super_Voltekka> REJECT BALANCE RETURN TO MONKE
[2:13:00] <+Shmario> @Menitta i dunno ...this look too diferent too ps2 version i played
[2:13:04] <BlackermanZX> peak gameplay

[2:13:07] <dds333a> these trades, man
[2:13:13] <%gatorafan> Maybe returning to monke isn't as good as people are making it out to be daedra1DerpyTibs

[2:13:40] <+Shmario> lets just asks EZ
[2:13:41] <@Menitta> that character was made for Saltybet yes
[2:13:42] <Arek_1> @Menitta What, there's nothing inherent about a PS2 emulator that makes it not work with Parsec.
[2:13:43] <DerpioParty> That's one good man
[2:13:47] <dds333a> Just normals, man
[2:13:48] <+Shmario> @WoolieVersus so this is PS2 or XBOX 360 ?
[2:13:51] <andre11dr> Dude his normals don't knock down in this matchup LUL
[2:14:08] <%jinking79> isn't it lvl 3
[2:14:10] <GeltonZ> @Shmario PS2
[2:14:13] <dds333a> Eh, not much
[2:14:16] <andre11dr> Also HIS STAND
[2:14:17] <+GalacticaPhanto> Nah it's Funny Valentine levels of absurd
[2:14:39] <+0neReeler> 1. shockwave, 2. monke leap
[2:14:42] <+GalacticaPhanto> The MONKE took the first napkin
[2:14:48] <dds333a> He needs more of a composite mix between actual fashion, and nonsense
[2:15:11] <JohnXuandou> this game has chains for some characters yes
[2:15:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:15:12] <357Sneak> lytUMMA
[2:15:13] <usurper_sos> you need lvl 3 super

[2:16:21] <tacostarvedbeast> @andre11dr idk what u mean, what about beni is jojoish? Kappa Kappa
[2:16:24] <+0neReeler> it's like mortal kombat where projectiles ignore each other
[2:16:32] <+0cash> Goodman mirror but cant use monkey when
[2:16:37] <dds333a> @tacostarvedbeast nothing about his face screams DIO, and lipstick is hardly unique, also yeah, Goodman isn't referencing Jojo, whereas beni is a direct ref

[2:23:19] <%ggbhtg> actually HOW
[2:23:21] <+Jiggisnipe> the switch to 3d got rid of special intors
[2:23:22] <%ggbhtg> and don't sday budget
[2:23:24] <+Jiggisnipe> intros*
[2:23:31] <%ggbhtg> and don't say budget, fuck that
[2:23:34] <Qsmash_> you get a 10 second cutscene that you'll skip anyway
[2:23:36] <tacostarvedbeast> to expensive?
[2:23:40] <JohnXuandou> in KoFXIV, Billy will bow to Geese for intro
[2:23:41] <andre11dr> MK 11 is the best you get
[2:23:45] <@Solidus_113> Animations wouldn't be that much different work
[2:23:57] <dds333a> that's what I was saying earlier. dialogue is good, but something better than that is appreciated
[2:24:05] <%ggbhtg> MK11 dialogue is the last hold-out
[2:24:12] <+balouie> marvel VS Capcom 3
[2:24:15] <dds333a> GG has almost full on fights in certain cases
[2:24:19] <@Solidus_113> BBTag had some custom animation intros
[2:24:20] <%jinking79> Sol vs Ky intro in Accent core still the best
[2:24:26] <+the22cstomp> bbtag aint a great game but it had custom intros
[2:24:31] <%ggbhtg> also, FighterZ Dramatic Finishes

[2:24:53] <OldManDeckardCain> sounds sus
[2:24:53] <andre11dr> Yeah Blazeblue has them
[2:24:55] <%ggbhtg> Youtube failing us? NotLikeThis
[2:25:05] <+the22cstomp> ragna/jin, azrael/kagura among others
[2:25:25] <tacostarvedbeast> the only games where i feel there is room for it right now is mvci, smash, and cross battle, everything else feels self contained
[2:25:30] <%jinking79> here a YouTube ad with a Uncensored Rap song
[2:25:32] <dds333a> @ggbhtg yeah, and stuff like that when it harken to canon is great. situation finishes in ASB where the same thing
[2:25:35] <%ggbhtg> options
[2:25:41] <SomersaultJustice> option
