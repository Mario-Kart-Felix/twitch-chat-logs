[0:08:47] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta they made a device for mag 2020 which just played the lick over and over
[0:09:06] <+Toptom924> This hurts my ears xD
[0:09:20] <@Menitta> thats amazing
[0:09:25] <%CrazyRainbows> CrazyRainbows subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:09:44] <+Toptom924> It’s cool though don’t get me wrong, I’m just not good with bass
[0:09:55] <@akuda_bar> it was supposed to be for tuning instruments but it just also had a megalovania setting
[0:10:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Let Injustice Reign
[0:10:31] <%CrazyRainbows> I'm with you on bass dude, I don't even like headphones that emphasize it. it irritates my ears or something
[0:10:56] <+Toptom924> Ahh I thought I was just a big crazy
[0:11:23] <%CrazyRainbows> if you are then I am too lol
[0:11:31] <Hoofty603> hate this game love this bois

[0:11:44] <TeepPhoenix> I was kind of hoping that DC FanDome was going to announcing Injustice 3.
[0:11:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Injustice feels right considering The Boys season 2 is coming soon
[0:11:56] <Artoo_The_Me> Atrocitus players!
[0:12:06] <%CrazyRainbows> GOD I'm so pumped for the 2nd season
[0:12:10] <TeepPhoenix> Atrocitus is the best, just because of his killer cat
[0:12:18] <Hoofty603> controls feel a bit clunky
[0:12:29] <+Toptom924> NeverRealm games I haven’t ever dived into so I’m here to see the hub bub is about

[0:13:01] <TeepPhoenix> Injustice 1 looks like cold dog doodoo compared to 2, MK10, and MK11
[0:13:01] <%doomerskeletor13> The story mode for this game was p cool
[0:13:12] <Hoofty603> oh for sure

[0:27:01] <ha2ken> Either way
[0:27:10] <TeepPhoenix> Oh shit yes. Bane is the best in that game.
[0:27:23] <TeepPhoenix> He's the Zangief of Injustice.
[0:27:36] <@Solidus_113> who doesn't have Injustice 2 here?
[0:27:36] <TeepPhoenix> And kind of Netherealm in general, really
[0:27:36] <@Menitta> I like Robin. He's cool
[0:27:42] <+CryptusMaximus> GGs with the MK tournament fellas. You made it hype to watch. \m/
[0:27:57] <prime_name> I wish it was a better Robin, character wise.
[0:28:05] <%Koover> Crossplay + rollback is the golden land
[0:28:09] <cgame_me811> @teepphoenix Agree
[0:28:12] <tearfuldevil> some people jsut dont have a pc, or dont have a console
[0:28:15] <+dream__center> hopefully IJ3 has a more interestin groster
[0:28:19] <@Menitta> He's really cool tho got a sword and cloak
[0:28:19] <+JayIRay> PC? PS4? psssshhhhh xbox is where it's at B)
[0:28:20] <+dream__center> and by roster I mean just Ninja Turtle chars
[0:28:29] <prime_name> Remember evil Nightwing from Injustice 1? With his swoosh hair
[0:28:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Damian is great, it’s just the Injustice universe makes people assholes permanently, like Wonder Woman
[0:28:53] <TeepPhoenix> That crazy psycho lady isn't Wonder Woman, she's some lunatic cosplaying as her.
[0:29:00] <%doomerskeletor13> @prime_name Yeah that was Damian too
[0:29:00] <+dream__center> i dunno. IJ1 roster seemed more nicer I guess. had a good blend of your do gooders and ass holes
[0:29:08] <hassanico2> I am here for Touhou Dong Dong
[0:29:10] <%Ecchigun> HAYATEI
[0:29:10] <cgame_me811> @prime_name I remember doodLUL
[0:29:13] <%Ecchigun> where u at
[0:29:23] <MBDiana1> my favorite part about injustice is that nobody is the good guy which by that everyone in the story is kind of horribly evil which makes it a true superheroe game
[0:29:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:29:24] <%penndra> penndra subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! hey this is great timing was thinking about picking up injustice 2 but wasn't sure. really looking forward to seeing how the fighting/gameplay is.
[0:29:25] <+dream__center> tho IJ2 did have cool wild cards like Gorilla Grodd
[0:29:29] <+Estuko> Thanks for the HyperReveal @penndra
[0:29:34] <+dream__center> and Black Canary
[0:29:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Swamp Thing
[0:29:46] <+ZacharyWile> Has he played Injustice 2, or just the first one?
[0:30:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah people are waiting for Injustice 3 at this point
[0:30:10] <+dream__center> Deadshot felt redundant
[0:30:13] <@Menitta> It is cool that you're taking into consideration the way to get the most people playing
[0:30:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Very cool
[0:30:24] <Broand> Did you know that the Umineko series is the successor of the Higurashi series, which is appearantly in the game after injustice?
[0:30:29] <cgame_me811> No Solomon Grundy doodSad
[0:30:32] <+Feralspirit41> So when does pat come in to tell us about how much he hates superman?
[0:30:35] <+dream__center> but then again I think people were looking for a Luthor like char from IJ1
[0:30:39] <TeepPhoenix> So what exactly is parsec? I'm pretty in the dark here
[0:30:42] <PanicSwytch> What are u wearing woolie?
[0:30:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> With warner Games on sale. good luck to all the NR studios fans
[0:30:48] <%Koover> @Broand put Ushiromiya Battler in Injustice
[0:30:59] <hassanico2> Do you have all the DLC characters, like Darkseid and Starfire?
[0:31:02] <%Ecchigun> parsec is legit
[0:31:02] <@Solidus_113> oh man, how do MK combos work on one-sided networking
[0:31:07] <%Ecchigun> it works very well
[0:31:07] <Broand> Battlers super atheist powers
[0:31:13] <+dream__center> parsec is cloud server like gaming?
[0:31:17] <@Menitta> oh no
[0:31:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh just now i noticed woolie is rocking his Vea unit 1 outfit
[0:31:18] <+ZacharyWile> @TeepPhoenix Think it's explained in the Han Solo movie (never watched it)

[0:40:54] <+dream__center> oh yeah Dr Professor Fate
[0:40:58] <Aussie_Manny> R A D I C A L
[0:40:58] <prime_name> Enchantress
[0:41:02] <tearfuldevil> dr fate
[0:41:03] <%doomerskeletor13> You merely adopted Injustice, I was born in it, molded by it
[0:41:04] <%BisoromiBear> turtles count it off
[0:41:06] <+dream__center> Black Adam is buff in this game too
[0:41:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> jesus

[0:41:15] <dinnydanny777> So uh, how do you balance that roster?
[0:41:18] <%Cal_ixo> No DLC?
[0:41:18] <TeepPhoenix> The Joker sucks in this game
[0:41:19] <+dream__center> oh yeah bane is in this game
[0:41:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Deathstroke is on Injustice 1. the one more similar to him in Injustice 2 is DeadShot
[0:41:26] <+dream__center> bane had the steroid stuff
[0:41:34] <TeepPhoenix> Bane and Scarecrow are in this
[0:41:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah and they added special skin characters that kept the same move sets but were different characters with new voice lines
[0:41:38] <Aussie_Manny> What came out first; Injustice 2 or MK 11?
[0:41:40] <Daxalog> Superman has LESS health than Atom. What!?
[0:41:41] <tearfuldevil> yay swamp thing
[0:41:43] <+dream__center> as shown by biohazard
[0:41:45] <@Menitta> Yeah this is why I hate the MK11/Injustice 2 custom moves
[0:41:46] <chll0ne> injustice 2
[0:41:50] <+dream__center> oh yeah the turtles are 4 chars in one or something
[0:41:57] <@Menitta> I'd rather have the MKX set movelists
[0:42:05] <+dream__center> NRS shoud just make a turtles FG
[0:42:08] <ha2ken> Y3ah
[0:42:14] <ha2ken> Yea Donny

[0:42:45] <cgame_me811> LUL
[0:42:49] <prime_name> Black Manta is super petty
[0:42:49] <+dream__center> and of course everyones favorite Deadshot
[0:42:52] <%TubeMan642> Firestorm the Nuclear man
[0:42:53] <brunoberserk> black manta is the best
[0:42:54] <%Cal_ixo> Firestorm is actually 2 ppl
[0:42:54] <%Irridium> dick move bro
[0:42:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Firestorm! He’s actually two people in one
[0:42:59] <%blaccbird914> black manta is hard to play
[0:42:59] <MackFighters> @WoolieVersus Firestorm is the fusion of a teenager and a professor
[0:43:02] <tearfuldevil> firestorm is a legacy hero possesed by his previous iteration, iirc?
[0:43:03] <Aussie_Manny> Is Flash's ultimate still in this one?
[0:43:06] <@Menitta> Does Deadshot have his Arkham Origins skin in this game
[0:43:11] <@Menitta> That design is incredible

[0:43:49] <Dante_Namikaze1> yes he is
[0:43:50] <Ion_Laser> It was hot garbage
[0:43:51] <@Menitta> Deathstroke is fucking cool
[0:43:52] <+dream__center> Slade Wilson was in IJ1 I think
[0:43:53] <Aussie_Manny> Slade.
[0:43:53] <TeepPhoenix> Deathstroke should have been in this game
[0:43:57] <%Koover> Deadspike Kappa
[0:43:57] <@Solidus_113> Slade is Deathstroke
[0:43:58] <Duke_of_HI> Who is Slade?
[0:43:58] <Mach5Mike> Slade is Deathstroke
[0:43:58] <Casinoroyale80> DEADPOOL
[0:44:00] <+OmegaOcelotOk> thats deathstroke
[0:44:01] <+dream__center> Deadpool
[0:44:01] <ha2ken> Will Smith vs Mutant Freakazoid
[0:44:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> deathstroke is cooler
[0:44:04] <%roxasoru> roxasoru subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! *pronounced Rocks-ah-soar-u I love Injustice 2 so much but I'm using my Prime Sub to support my favorite Fighting Game enthusiasts on my birthday today
[0:44:04] <+jiggy_snipe> Slade is Deathstroke
[0:44:05] <+dream__center> Red Spidey
[0:44:15] <prime_name> Man these animations.
[0:44:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> In this game? no he's not Will Smith
[0:44:18] <%Koover> Thanks for the HyperCooldown @roxasoru
[0:44:22] <%Mrthefro> Will Smith of Gemini Man fame PogChamp
[0:44:23] <+dream__center> deathstroke promotes you to 'spam' projectiles
[0:44:25] <dinnydanny777> who was the villain in the Daredevil movie
[0:44:29] <%DianaTheAscian> y was his name slade anyway?
[0:44:30] <%DemonOfSalt> Just watched Suicide Squad for the first time last night. Will Smith was 60% of the reason why I didn't just turn off the movie.
[0:44:31] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus health bars are cut off the stream screen
[0:44:31] <spardanwarrior> Bullseye
[0:44:33] <TeepPhoenix> The only reason Deadshot is in this is because he had a movie out when this game came out
[0:44:37] <+dream__center> since the projectile game in IJ2 is pretty brutal to some degree
[0:44:41] <Dante_Namikaze1> Deathstroke wins way different, and its Orange and Blue/black and his real name is Slade
[0:44:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @dinnydanny777 Kingpin
[0:44:52] <+LeaIsChill> Is the top of the screen cut off?
[0:44:58] <@Solidus_113> it is
[0:44:58] <Pappajimbo> slade is deathstroke the just didnt want "death" name in a kids cartoon
[0:44:59] <TeepPhoenix> He stole Deathstroke's spot
[0:45:00] <+jiggy_snipe> I think they didn't want Death in a kid show
[0:45:08] <tearfuldevil> @TeepPhoenix he gets some push as the suicides squad leader, but yeah, thats pretty much right, he's barely a b lister
[0:45:11] <dinnydanny777> @morcego_cinzento_arts Nah I meant the Colin Farrel guy
[0:45:11] <+Story_Ark> Man i wanted to like I2 so much. i love dc and the tmnt are my fave 80s franchise.
[0:45:12] <masterfire23> deathstroke AKA Slade Wilson
[0:45:14] <KiariMugi> @woolieversus have you seen Baki the grappler my mans
[0:45:18] <+dream__center> that said deadshot wasn't winning much even the first months and fell off in comparison to heavy hitters like Black Adam
[0:45:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @dinnydanny777 ah that. he is Bullseye
[0:45:40] <ha2ken> Barely seeing those HP bars
[0:45:46] <dinnydanny777> Ah
[0:45:46] <deafmelone> teen titans version of deathstroke is the best
[0:45:48] <cgame_me811> deathstroke doodTerror
[0:45:49] <TeepPhoenix> I also kind of prefer "Slade" in the cartoon since he's more of a supervillain mastermind instead of a mercenary assassin like "Deathstroke" in the comics
[0:45:52] <+dream__center> oh yeah the healoth bars may be adjusted
[0:45:54] <tearfuldevil> deathstroke aka slade wilson aka weeb pedo superhuman mercenary Punisher
[0:45:56] <chll0ne> deathstroke always sounded mad sexual tbh
[0:46:00] <+dream__center> you can adjust the health bar UI
[0:46:00] <FishTacosTonite> Woolie can you move health bars down.
[0:46:03] <FishTacosTonite> ??
[0:46:06] <TeepPhoenix> Also the bounce activates the stage transitions when at certain spots
[0:46:09] <+polchurgyst> thats not what that word means lmao
[0:46:11] <Aussie_Manny> You're so far apart!
[0:46:11] <%sporeian94> I can't wait for Injustice 3 when The Watchmen will be in it and I can play as Rorschach and taunt my opponents with slurs and bad hygiene
[0:46:18] <Aussie_Manny> LOOK HOW LOUD I HAVE TO YELL
[0:46:18] <KingDeathCradle> turtle power!
[0:46:23] <chll0ne> LUL
[0:46:25] <tearfuldevil> @chll0ne his first maor apperence, the famours Teen Titans story arc, he had sex with a 15 year old lol
[0:46:28] <+dream__center> maybe IJ3 will be about factions
[0:46:32] <tearfuldevil> @chll0ne it is super sexual
[0:46:41] <chll0ne> yeah judas contract
[0:46:43] <+dream__center> oh yeah the CLASH mechanic
[0:46:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Pappajimbo That would explain his lack of swords and guns as well
[0:46:50] <chll0ne> beating teras cheeks
[0:46:56] <MichaelOfCainhurst> @sporeian94 a true gamer
[0:47:00] <MichaelOfCainhurst> LUL
[0:47:00] <TeepPhoenix> The clash mechanic is less stupid in this game
[0:47:03] <BalloniWright> I actually like Terra
[0:47:03] <dinnydanny777> Does Deathstroke actually have any powers other than having a gun
[0:47:04] <+dream__center> I wouldn't mind IJ3 if it was just gotham the fighting game
[0:47:05] <TeepPhoenix> compared to 1
[0:47:14] <+ZacharyWile> Oh no, he's discovered the power of Deadshot spam
[0:47:18] <TeepPhoenix> Chevy Nova?
[0:47:18] <Aussie_Manny> Cyborg, Deathstroke and Green Arrow zoning, omg.
[0:47:20] <+dream__center> deathstroke don't miss and he spams :)
[0:47:30] <tearfuldevil> wait they got fucking atrocitus?
[0:47:31] <+dream__center> i mean deadshot
[0:47:32] <tearfuldevil> lol
[0:47:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Deathstroke has super soldier stuff going on, Deadshot is just good at shooting
[0:47:33] <+gingersnipsnap> I just learned something about Deathstroke that I didn’t want to dsaCRINGE
[0:47:36] <+dream__center> whooops
[0:47:39] <%WinstonFromUndertale> I love just seeing the image of combat man beating on a ninja turtle
[0:47:42] <Aussie_Manny> C O W A B U N G A
[0:47:43] <@Menitta> thats sick
[0:47:45] <BalloniWright> Kreygasm
[0:47:47] <stabbityrabbit> I guess Deadshot's alter-ego is Billie Eilish.
[0:47:48] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[0:47:49] <TeepPhoenix> All four of them have the same super
[0:47:53] <cgame_me811> doodmaxhype
[0:47:55] <spawnzie> Pizza time .mp4
[0:48:00] <Dante_Namikaze1> @dinnydanny777 yes, enhanced strength like Captain America, a healing factor, and enhanced agility and brain power
[0:48:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @dinnydanny777 he voluntered for an army medical experiemnt that overhall enhances his physical prowess and resiliance
[0:48:08] <Aussie_Manny> smokin' sick style
[0:48:08] <dinnydanny777> This is the guy in Arkham who doesn't miss?
[0:48:12] <+LeaIsChill> That's...all he's got really
[0:48:14] <@Menitta> Injustice 2 is still back to block right
[0:48:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes
[0:48:18] <BalloniWright> @dinnydanny777 yes
[0:48:21] <TeepPhoenix> I think it's one of the triggers
[0:48:22] <+dream__center> yeah IJ2 has no block buton
[0:48:23] <Aussie_Manny> @dinnydanny777 He never EVER misses!
[0:48:24] <@Menitta> good
[0:48:26] <+dream__center> MK series has a block button
[0:48:35] <+dream__center> BUUUT IJ2s projetile play is crazy
[0:48:47] <@Menitta> Ididnt remember if IJ also had block button or not
[0:48:49] <+dream__center> since projectiles at times come out pretty fast and don't clash with each other
[0:48:50] <+pectusumbra> Alright, I might come back to watch punch planet, but I'm just eh on injustice. Later!
[0:48:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Deadshot never misses Kappa except all those times he missed Batman in Arkham City
[0:48:57] <TeepPhoenix> I play it with a PS4 so I'm not sure about Xbox
[0:49:04] <cgame_me811> @dream__center Yeah
[0:49:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> for information. yeah in the arkham games, Deadshot is the assassin famed for never missing
[0:49:10] <+nechallenger> I think clashes are like breakers
[0:49:12] <deafmelone> Forward block when getting comboed, but you need meter
[0:49:12] <%WinstonFromUndertale> “Shell shocked!” Immediately gets stabbed 3 times
[0:49:12] <+ZacharyWile> I prefer how Injustice does Health to Mortal Kombat. Two health bars, rather than one health bar that reloads for the next round.
[0:49:19] <%koolaid_kevster> i think it happens while you fight like to atks hitting in sinc3e
[0:49:19] <+GalacticaPhanto> @doomerskeletor13 Next time, I wont miss
[0:49:22] <+Painkirax3> I think it’s forward block
[0:49:22] <%koolaid_kevster> sync
[0:49:29] <dinnydanny777> @doomerskeletor13 He didn't shoot him cause he loves him duh
[0:49:31] <+dream__center> IJ2 also starts you on the spot where you got KO'd
[0:49:38] <delthax007> forward r2 on the second lifebar
[0:49:42] <+dream__center> so if you got KO'd in the corner... good luck fighting from there when u get up round 2
[0:49:46] <%snakest3alth> To start a clash, you need to press the right trigger when you get your ass beat
[0:49:48] <HalloweenHangover> Clashes work like combo breakers right?
[0:49:54] <@Menitta> I'm curious what's more balanced. Two life bars or two rounds
[0:49:57] <TeepPhoenix> and you can only do it once you've lost a round
[0:50:00] <%koolaid_kevster> wait
[0:50:07] <%koolaid_kevster> i think its like a conbo breaker
[0:50:08] <@Menitta> there must be trade offs to both
[0:50:10] <raikagelord1> Question does Woolie like Superman? If not that is ok.
[0:50:13] <Dante_Namikaze1> @doomerskeletor13 well it is canon that Batman was the first person to make him miss and is the reason why he got sent to jail and eventually got forced on the Suicide Squad
[0:50:25] <+dream__center> @Menitta depends. But I don't like startting the round on the spot you got KO'd in
[0:50:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:34] <%WinstonFromUndertale> Woolie loves Superman
[0:50:36] <dinnydanny777> pee
[0:50:37] <AllTheZibas> Clash is only available on second bar
[0:50:40] <%WinstonFromUndertale> It’s one of his faves
[0:50:40] <dinnydanny777> pew*
[0:50:41] <+dream__center> I'll take 3 rounds if it means we start in a neutral spot aka the middle of the stage
[0:50:43] <Aussie_Manny> Donny!
[0:50:43] <AllTheZibas> of health
[0:50:44] <Dante_Namikaze1> wait is Troy Baker the voice of Deadshot in this game?
[0:50:44] <MackFighters> @WoolieVersus only available on red bar of health
[0:50:47] <spardanwarrior> Need to have lost one round @WoolieVersus
[0:50:47] <+dream__center> BabyRage STOP SPAMMMMING
[0:50:51] <dinnydanny777> I meant to say pew lmao
[0:50:55] <BalloniWright> @WoolieVersus Round 2
[0:50:56] <+Painkirax3> Clashes are for your second life bar
[0:50:58] <+dream__center> BabyRage PLS STOP spamming that shooty move
[0:51:04] <raikagelord1> I need to buy Superman:Red son Comic.
[0:51:05] <HalloweenHangover> Yes
[0:51:07] <TeepPhoenix> Clashes are kind of a comeback mechanic
[0:51:08] <Dante_Namikaze1> yes
[0:51:08] <spardanwarrior> Yes iirc
[0:51:14] <TeepPhoenix> Bingo
[0:51:16] <@Menitta> @dream__center I know I prefer two life bars because A. matches go faster and B. any work you did to put damage in isnt wasted after one round
[0:51:16] <+dream__center> oh yeah this game is def string based too
[0:51:16] <dinnydanny777> Is this animal abuse
[0:51:31] <%WinstonFromUndertale> Yes
[0:51:34] <%doomerskeletor13> This is child abuse and animal abuse
[0:51:35] <prime_name> The hitch was something
[0:51:45] <Dante_Namikaze1> that normally doesn't happen
[0:51:48] <%koolaid_kevster> ii think you only get 1 a match no?
[0:51:50] <+Estuko> turtle power dud
[0:51:51] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:51:51] <@Menitta> oh no
[0:51:52] <+dream__center> WORD?
[0:51:52] <Zayasu> LUL
[0:51:53] <@akuda_bar> LUL
[0:51:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i really like Deadshot's combos of knife stabs and point blank shooting with his utterly weird working brace guns
[0:51:55] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[0:51:57] <prime_name> Deadshot shot it!
[0:51:57] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[0:51:57] <cgame_me811> doodLUL
[0:51:58] <Aussie_Manny> L A G
[0:52:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL everything works tonight
[0:52:04] <%Irridium> DISQUALIFIED
[0:52:04] <%JustYudha> John's?
[0:52:08] <brunoberserk> CURSED
[0:52:12] <+dream__center> Woolie will figure it out
[0:52:14] <TeepPhoenix> He never misses
[0:52:14] <Aussie_Manny> gg
[0:52:16] <%JetpackMcQuack> FeelsBadMan
[0:52:21] <Donk2x> MORTIS
[0:52:22] <+dream__center> He's Deadshot. He never misses.
[0:52:31] <+Painkirax3> Why not just play on console??
[0:52:37] <Aussie_Manny> He shot your controller's batteries.
[0:52:41] <+dream__center> QLOC....
[0:52:45] <%Bearjewpiter> Deadshot shot the batteries D:
[0:52:52] <raikagelord1> How does everyone fee about the New Suicide Squad game?
[0:52:54] <TeepPhoenix> Hahaha, the TMNT KO animation from the arcade
[0:52:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> What is the curse placed on Woolie that all his controllers are fucked beyond reason?
[0:52:58] <stabbityrabbit> With how tonight is going Woolie will try to open Punch Planet and find out that the devs deleted it.
[0:53:04] <+dream__center> special moves, command normals and Strings
[0:53:07] <dinnydanny777> I like to think Deadshot never misses because he pretends everytime he misses he was intending to miss
[0:53:09] <+ZacharyWile> Every day millions of people are brutally traumatized by Deadshot spammers. Call this number to get the mental help and recovery you need.
[0:53:13] <%koolaid_kevster> i think they only have the 2 no?
[0:53:21] <+dream__center> CAPTAIN COLDDDDD
[0:53:22] <dinnydanny777> Like Deadshot shoots a wall and he pretends he intended to do it
[0:53:23] <BalloniWright> Snark is great
[0:53:24] <+dream__center> Flash villain
[0:53:25] <%doomerskeletor13> @raikagelord1 I’m interested. It was an intriguing trailer
[0:53:26] <+Estuko> Captain Cold is so cool I love him
[0:53:29] <+dream__center> sorta forgettable
[0:53:31] <Aussie_Manny> I aM gOtHaM's ReCkOnInG!
[0:53:33] <TeepPhoenix> Not in the least, every character has a different gameplay mechanic with the character powers
[0:53:35] <powerprotoman> captain cold is dope as fuck
[0:53:38] <+dream__center> Professor Freeze
[0:53:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Captain Cold is cool
[0:53:42] <Jeebus4> play munkey
[0:53:45] <Aussie_Manny> HE'S TOP TIER LUL
[0:53:46] <+dream__center> Doctor Fridge
[0:53:49] <Aussie_Manny> WTF
[0:53:56] <+DrFacilier> i love that they pulled out some lesser known characters so much.
[0:53:57] <+dream__center> Bane got the steroid buff stuff
[0:54:01] <raikagelord1> Captain cold is top tier and a great character.
[0:54:02] <TeepPhoenix> Cold still has to jerk off his little gun to do anything with it
[0:54:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 i cannot say cause i didn't watch the trailer. but i'm usually meh to anything Suicide Squad related except the Assault on ARkham animated movie all those years ago
[0:54:14] <+Painkirax3> Moves don’t change with equipment you do or take less damage with equipment but you can pick 3 additional abilities
[0:54:14] <TeepPhoenix> You can't, you can in MK!1
[0:54:21] <+dream__center> yeah Cold def is a good char in this games timeline
[0:54:22] <cgame_me811> Woolie playing a grappler WutFace
[0:54:24] <BalloniWright> Captain Cold doesn't kill
[0:54:31] <Daxalog> Is this on PC?
[0:54:35] <+dream__center> yes on PC
[0:54:36] <Zayasu> u can do a benchmark test
[0:54:47] <tearfuldevil> most of the flash villains are punch clock villains
[0:54:48] <TeepPhoenix> Captain Cold does kill, he just doesn't hurt innocents
[0:54:50] <AllTheZibas> Bane gets debuffed on venom cooldown
[0:54:50] <+dream__center> maybe on EX?
[0:54:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh the lag is not just on twitch's end, it's actually in the game? woof
[0:54:59] <@Solidus_113> remember that Woolie never shuts down his PC, so it's probably screaming in pain
[0:55:00] <%NeedlesD> Benchmark the PC, and Venom hits increase your strength but you get debuffed when it runs out
[0:55:01] <+dream__center> oh yeah venom gets debuff on venom cooldown
[0:55:08] <%WinstonFromUndertale> Shoulda been bane v. Hell boy 😔
[0:55:11] <Daxalog> Woolie turn your PC off when your are done
[0:55:16] <Daxalog> Sleep dont count
[0:55:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i really love Cold's personality. like he feels like the normal bluecollar attittude guy of super villains
[0:55:21] <%hamahiroyuki> was he the guy who put his wife in liquid nitrogen to save her?
[0:55:28] <chll0ne> no
[0:55:29] <%NeedlesD> No
[0:55:32] <@Solidus_113> no that was Mr Freeze
[0:55:34] <BalloniWright> Oh yeah he doesn't kill superheroes neither, cuz it's "bad for business"
[0:55:34] <%koolaid_kevster> the run is armored
[0:55:35] <raikagelord1> @doomerskeletor13 and @morcego_cinzento_arts kinda worried about the game being good. Don’t like the art and the presentation of how the gameplay might be plus the over all tone compared to the Arkham games.
[0:55:36] <TeepPhoenix> You can buff that move to chain it into an elbow drop with the pro moves
[0:55:36] <chll0ne> thats mr freeze
[0:55:41] <tearfuldevil> @hamahiroyuki that mr freeze, the batman ice villain lol
[0:55:52] <TeepPhoenix> Er, meter burn
[0:55:56] <deafmelone> mr freeze is a skin for cold in this game tho
[0:55:57] <%WinstonFromUndertale> U need to chill out
[0:55:58] <+dream__center> meter burn probably got follow up options
[0:56:01] <%JustYudha> What's the main difference between Mr Freeze and this dude?
[0:56:02] <%democrazyyy> this guy is a flash villain whose gun slows molecules to absolute zero, thus making ice
[0:56:04] <%hamahiroyuki> lol, thats an overlaping
[0:56:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @hamahiroyuki Nah, that is Victor Freeze(which is an skin for Captain cold in this game, with is own voiced intros)
[0:56:12] <%JustYudha> Ahh
[0:56:12] <raikagelord1> Can’t Bane be great in this game? I know he was good in the first one.
[0:56:15] <TeepPhoenix> Was that a Stone Cold stunner?
[0:56:16] <ha2ken> Arnie Freeze
[0:56:25] <anuchallengertwitch> Am I the only one who thinks Ben 10 would make a neat guest character?
[0:56:33] <+dream__center> Bane was mid tier I think
[0:56:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah you can put a Mr Freeze skin on Captain Cold and it will actually change his dialogue
[0:56:37] <%hamahiroyuki> ah thx guys
[0:56:42] <raikagelord1> @anuchallengertwitch that would be cool.
[0:56:47] <+dream__center> there are def stronger chars
[0:56:53] <+dream__center> like Black Adam
[0:57:01] <+dream__center> Aqua man was stupid too for a month due to his string
[0:57:05] <%democrazyyy> also captain cold is like genuinely super dangerous lmao he's the best
[0:57:08] <+dream__center> then they took the string out and nobody complained anymore
[0:57:12] <Dante_Namikaze1> @anuchallengertwitch he would the only problem is which version of him and what alien will he be
[0:57:31] <+dream__center> yeah cold is a setup character
[0:57:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:57:35] <spawnzie> wasn't Neo originally ment to be DLC?
[0:57:35] <Tunamanguy> Bane?
[0:57:37] <+dream__center> traple people in spots/space
[0:57:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 i'll check it out after teh stream
[0:58:13] <TeepPhoenix> And then a nuclear DDT
[0:58:14] <+dream__center> that super punishes long distance
[0:58:14] <%doomerskeletor13> @spawnzie He’s rumored as a guest character for 3 allegedly
[0:58:18] <anuchallengertwitch> @Dante_Namikaze1 I think Alien Force/ Ultimate Alien Ben would fit the best for Injustice. Though I wonder what an all ben 10 fighting game would be like
[0:58:19] <Dante_Namikaze1> check out Captain Clod's super
[0:58:21] <%BisoromiBear> BAH GAWD
[0:58:22] <+dream__center> which should help bane
[0:58:27] <%doomerskeletor13> BAH GAWD
[0:58:44] <+dream__center> i forgot if bane's super was full screen on the ground
[0:58:48] <dinnydanny777> Superhero violence is kind of cartoonish isn't it
[0:58:50] <TeepPhoenix> Some moves don't have meter burn
[0:59:04] <Dante_Namikaze1> @anuchallengertwitch so would you pick like Swamp Fire as the alien
[0:59:08] <BreakersAweigh> and the subtitles!
[0:59:08] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus health bars are cut off the stream screen too
[0:59:10] <%democrazyyy> subtitles for intros?
[0:59:15] <Aussie_Manny> omg that ending pose was weak
[0:59:16] <%DianaTheAscian> also subtitles
[0:59:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Ye subtitles!
[0:59:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @JustYudha the former suffered an lab accident with cryogenic chemicals that makes him only being able to survive below zero. the later is just an bank robber with freezing tech
[0:59:24] <TeepPhoenix> I think subtitles are only in the story mode
[0:59:26] <Dante_Namikaze1> @democrazyyy no for story
[0:59:34] <+dream__center> yeah u can fix the health bar stuff
[0:59:55] <@Solidus_113> oof
[1:00:03] <%doomerskeletor13> F
[1:00:04] <+dream__center> hmmm
[1:00:06] <@Solidus_113> switch the particles
[1:00:07] <anuchallengertwitch> @Dante_Namikaze1 I would have it so Ben transformed into different aliens for special moves. Humungosaur charge attack, heatblast uppercut, Feedback projectiles, etc.
[1:00:13] <%NeedlesD> particles?
[1:00:18] <@Solidus_113> particles mode should be GPU
[1:00:25] <%emperordread> "I swear this doesn't usually happen..." we've all been there guys
[1:00:27] <+dream__center> send particles mode to GPU?
[1:00:28] <Jeebus4> You shouldnt be having issues
[1:00:29] <%Cal_ixo> "this never happens" Thats what they all say!
[1:00:34] <TeepPhoenix> NRS games on the PC can be kinda janky
[1:00:36] <+wmeldrum> that's def gpu
[1:00:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> what did you expect you're playing a nertherream game on pc which always have issues
[1:00:45] <+dream__center> QLOC usually is good. usually...
[1:00:49] <%SirGO0SE> that matters for sure
[1:00:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> why you asking me, game? monkaS
[1:00:56] <+dream__center> better than MKX first PC port. LORD that was horrible
[1:01:03] <+dream__center> High Votlage STudios def shit the bed on that one
[1:01:08] <@Solidus_113> shadow technique?
[1:01:20] <%WinstonFromUndertale> U pressed autoconfig son
[1:01:26] <%WinstonFromUndertale> I’m p sure u did
[1:01:34] <Dante_Namikaze1> All WB superhero/NRS games are kinda fucked on PC
[1:01:37] <%Bail_seven> why is the earth spinning so fast?!?!
[1:01:45] <anuchallengertwitch> If a new TMNT fgihting game is made, I'd want the people who did the 2013 Killer Instinct to make it
[1:02:00] <deafmelone> @anuchallengertwitch YES
[1:02:05] <Aussie_Manny> PC brain strain. Kappa
[1:02:06] <@Solidus_113> Dynamic resolution could fix the stuttering, but the image would take a big hit
[1:02:11] <Zayasu> remember arkham knight pc launch WutFace
[1:02:18] <+dream__center> I'll take NRS making a TMNT fighting game. Less emphasis on IJ2 projectile play and more MKX like craziness.
[1:02:28] <raikagelord1> I want Bronze Tiger, El Diablo and Booster Gold to be a Character.
[1:02:29] <%WutangchickeN> hey boys
[1:02:38] <%JustYudha> Do you guys use VSync on fighting games?
[1:02:38] <raikagelord1> In Injustice 3
[1:02:44] <+ZacharyWile> Same place ResidentSleeper
[1:02:58] <+dream__center> As crazy as MKX was and people did complain, I think everyone had more fun with that game overall
[1:03:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> Who has better armor
[1:03:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hmm seems to be still happening
[1:03:08] <+dream__center> WOW that lag
[1:03:15] <Aussie_Manny> BAD PERFORMANCE OMG
[1:03:17] <TeepPhoenix> If Booster Gold isn't in IJ3 they're stupid
[1:03:20] <raikagelord1> @dream__center I agree
[1:03:26] <Dante_Namikaze1> @raikagelord1 I think Booster Gold is dead in this universe
[1:03:30] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @dream__center i would agree with that statement
[1:03:33] <@Solidus_113> I desperately want to see the Task Manager on Woolie's PC right now
[1:03:35] <BreakersAweigh> its almost worst lmao
[1:03:37] <+lethallylactic> 🍕
[1:03:39] <+dream__center> when Reggie figures out to work in long range
[1:03:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 Bronze tiger would had been such an obvious pic for an fighting game. I guess since he doesn't appear much outside of comics, he was not considerated.
[1:03:45] <anuchallengertwitch> @dream__center NRS would also make good into interactions. However, I'd like the KI developers because I don't really like NRS animation. I'd also like for a TMNT fighting game to be faster paced like KI
[1:03:46] <Bamcc2> LUL
[1:03:48] <Zayasu> try fullscreen and do benchmark maybe?
[1:03:50] <Aussie_Manny> thebkSip
[1:03:52] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:04:03] <%Takreth> woolieMIRIN
[1:04:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> win game, sippy juice
[1:04:12] <deafmelone> @anuchallengertwitch I agree
[1:04:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> A turtles gotta eat
[1:04:21] <+dream__center> oh yeah IJ2 got some DOT stuff
[1:04:33] <TeepPhoenix> Donnie's character power debuffs his opponent to keep them from jumping
[1:04:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:04:37] <BreakersAweigh> that one's pretty rad lmao
[1:04:43] <PunchPlanetGame> punchpByb
[1:04:44] <Aussie_Manny> S H E L L S H O C K E D MorphinTime
[1:04:52] <+dream__center> keep him out
[1:05:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:05:02] <anuchallengertwitch> @deafmelone I would also like if a new TMNT fighter took bits and pieces from all Turtles incarnations, not just one. So some stuff from 1987, some stuff from 2003, IDW, maybe even Rise Stuff or characters.
[1:05:03] <PunchPlanetGame> @WoolieVersus did i miss the Punch Planet?
[1:05:07] <Aussie_Manny> blanka ballllll
[1:05:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> to be honest. i could see Rafael doing the most disrespectful thing during an fight
[1:05:11] <raikagelord1> @dante_namikaze1 I think El Diablo( though has resurrection in prime universe) is dead but Booster was just in Time jail I think cause he tried to save Ted Kord.
[1:05:11] <Dante_Namikaze1> if you were Superman you can put ch through armor
[1:05:13] <@Solidus_113> Dynamic resolution could fix the stuttering, but the image would take a big hit @WoolieVersus
[1:05:13] <+dream__center> Kreygasm
[1:05:15] <BalloniWright> Oh that's why Woolie plays him LUL
[1:05:15] <+lethallylactic> Mmmm Kreygasm
[1:05:18] <Hoofty603> i gotta a wet my beak
[1:05:18] <%emperordread> ewww, mushrooms on pizza
[1:05:19] <%democrazyyy> look at him! he loves it!
[1:05:24] <powerprotoman> the onyl fix is to drop pc woolie
[1:05:24] <Aussie_Manny> yummm, mushrooms
[1:05:27] <+DarthTaco> you can press buttons in time with the super's hit to do more damage iirc
[1:05:28] <$Aitch971> fuck now i want pizza
[1:05:29] <TeepPhoenix> I dig the OG TMNT cartoon reference
[1:05:35] <0rond> super succs Kreygasm
[1:05:39] <deafmelone> @anuchallengertwitch that would be sick!
[1:05:39] <anuchallengertwitch> Fun fact: in the 2003 TMNT show, Donatello is the one who beat the Shredder the most.
[1:05:42] <%NeedlesD> turn vsync off?
[1:05:45] <+jiggy_snipe> should vsync be off?
[1:05:51] <rbakervv> turn dynamic on
[1:06:00] <+ZacharyWile> @TeepPhoenix What's the reference?
[1:06:04] <Dante_Namikaze1> the only way to fix it completely is to play On Xbone or PS4 @woolieversus
[1:06:07] <masterfire23> framerate > visuals
[1:06:17] <%SirGO0SE> maybe theres a controller issue going on in the background? just a hunch since graphics are clearly low and you were getting controller issues earlier
[1:06:17] <%JustYudha> I googled it and the stuttering may come from Denuvo as the anti cheat-tamper software for the game
[1:06:18] <TeepPhoenix> He throws the pizza at the screen like Raph in the 1987 cartoon intro
[1:06:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> Who knows
[1:06:34] <+jiggy_snipe> ugh
[1:06:39] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus do benchmark before going into a match
[1:06:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> you know an character of the DC comics that would had been awesome in this game? Wildcat. an straight up old boxxer
[1:06:41] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts I agree and he was pretty cool in Suicide Squad: Hell to pay( which was an ok movie and Continuation of the flash point movie)
[1:06:42] <%SirGO0SE> wow if true @JustYudha
[1:06:42] <+jiggy_snipe> I hope its not Denuvo
[1:06:51] <Aussie_Manny> it's fiiiiiine
[1:06:54] <%NeedlesD> its fine, Woolie
[1:06:56] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts I agree
[1:07:07] <TeepPhoenix> Do some Atrocitus
[1:07:09] <PunchPlanetGame> punchpByb swifti10Ameno
[1:07:10] <%Koover> its all good, I know how that is
[1:07:14] <%koolaid_kevster> is this cross platform?
[1:07:26] <Dante_Namikaze1> @morcego_cinzento_arts he may already be dead but we don't know yet since they just made a year zero to this
[1:07:29] <tearfuldevil> @koolaid_kevster no crossplay
[1:07:46] <Aussie_Manny> 60's. But yeah.
[1:07:46] <TeepPhoenix> Ya didn't see Black Manta in the new Aquaman movie?
[1:07:48] <anuchallengertwitch> Black Manta is petty as fuck and I love it.
[1:07:53] <brunoberserk> Black Manta : Aquaman , how is your wife and kid ?
[1:07:54] <+evbites> Black "how's your dead son" Manta
[1:08:00] <powerprotoman> black manta killed aquamans kid and loves to bring it up every chance he gets
[1:08:05] <+Posh_Cat> ellaHEY hi there
[1:08:08] <raikagelord1> @dante_namikaze1 he was in a Coma but Batman Pulled the Plug to revive him.
[1:08:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah he murdered Aquamans kid
[1:08:20] <TeepPhoenix> Raph probably has the best character power if you know how to use it of the 4 turtles
[1:08:24] <Aussie_Manny> Sai!
[1:08:24] <tearfuldevil> black manta is so petty and evil its great
[1:08:29] <+Posh_Cat> Man i used to main red hood way back when
[1:08:33] <PushBaiken4SummerSlam> psaJpeg
[1:08:38] <%democrazyyy> God black manta is so COOL. FUCK.
[1:08:40] <Aussie_Manny> oohhhh, it's bad
[1:08:42] <raikagelord1> Oh yeah Black Manta Loves Killing Aquamans Kids.
[1:08:48] <Pyrrhus90> hey aquaman, how's the wife and kid? LUL
[1:08:50] <%democrazyyy> I can't get over how cool he is. like holy shit
[1:08:56] <+Posh_Cat> the gun kata combos so much fun especially the bouncing
[1:08:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Dante_Namikaze1 if it is regarding the continuity of the Injustice comic ark. the video games pretty much make their own cannon and the Injustice comics are retconned to fit those changes, giving how popular the two games are.
[1:08:58] <Aussie_Manny> THEY FLY NOW
[1:09:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh boy here I go killing Aquamans kids again
[1:09:31] <raikagelord1> Aqua-lad would be a cool character.
[1:09:36] <+dream__center> WAGER TIME
[1:09:41] <RedHotBoss> that dance stacks woolie
[1:09:44] <brunoberserk> Black Manta : you gonna be more dead than aquaman dead son
[1:09:49] <+dream__center> isn't there an aqua-lad skin?
[1:10:14] <BreakersAweigh> that dance is so silly lmao
[1:10:15] <+evbites> Blackmanta: My whole deal is i like to kill and that's it
[1:10:23] <BreakersAweigh> imagine doing that in the middle of a fight
[1:10:35] <Aussie_Manny> you lamed it out, reggieeee
[1:10:36] <%democrazyyy> YOOOOOOO
[1:10:37] <%JustYudha> "Gorilla or Robin can cause small freezes/stuters. When robin does one of his special attacks, Denuvo starts writing a private key to the memory. Then Fills the buffer and when everything is filled and they key is obtained by Denuvo itself, it starts executing anti-tamper checks"
[1:10:37] <+jiggy_snipe> oooo
[1:10:40] <+jiggy_snipe> that was cool
[1:10:41] <TeepPhoenix> Manta has the best victory stance
[1:10:41] <+sweetpotatokingwow> the shell thing is mildly cursed
[1:10:43] <Aussie_Manny> that's a cool win screend
[1:10:46] <+Estuko> That's COOL
[1:10:51] <%CEGold> CEGold subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[1:10:52] <rbakervv> the more your dance, they more powerful the trait is
[1:10:53] <@Solidus_113> I'm seeing on the Steam Forums that the game has performance issues, even with recent high-end parts
[1:10:54] <+dream__center> so is black manta a B Villain from Aquaman?
[1:11:02] <Zayasu> time to go 720p BibleThump
[1:11:06] <TeepPhoenix> Manta is Aquaman's archnemesis, actually
[1:11:08] <BalloniWright> @dream__center Main Villain
[1:11:09] <%democrazyyy> I'm gonna have to watch Aquaman tonight. I need more manta
[1:11:11] <Dante_Namikaze1> it won't fix it
[1:11:11] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s Aquamans main villain really
[1:11:14] <+ZacharyWile> It's not worth it
[1:11:14] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe its just poorly optimized
[1:11:16] <+dream__center> ah ok
[1:11:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Besides Orm maybe
[1:11:21] <+evbites> Black manta: I will use the race card to escape
[1:11:27] <%Bail_seven> maybe fullscrren?
[1:11:31] <wibbwobbler> full potato mode
[1:11:34] <Dante_Namikaze1> @woolieversus it won't fix it
[1:11:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1297990589783441409?s=20
[1:11:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @evbites i like that in an dialogue with the golden age flash, he states that he loves that about Manta. it's old fashioned transparent
[1:11:36] <Hoofty603> how about stop while your ahead
[1:11:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah Black Manta is also literally black too
[1:11:45] <StarkMaximum> Black Manta is Aquaman's main villain it's just that most attention on DC stops at Superman, Batman, and then halfway through Wonder Woman
[1:11:46] <PushBaiken4SummerSlam> I never want to see a ninja turtle go in themselves again...
[1:11:47] <TeepPhoenix> Maybe close any other programs running als?
[1:11:57] <+dream__center> yeah NRS def programs their shit easier for console
[1:12:03] <+dream__center> its StarFire
[1:12:04] <Aussie_Manny> Because devs don't wanna handle the PC optimization?
[1:12:04] <+sweetpotatokingwow> how did i sleep on this game this roster is STACKED
[1:12:05] <BalloniWright> Starfire Kreygasm
[1:12:09] <TeepPhoenix> Yes
[1:12:09] <%democrazyyy> he just fucks with Aquaman. using race cars to get away, faking having autism to paint himself as the victim. murdering Aquaman kid and bragging about it every time they meet
[1:12:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Raiden PogChamp consult those elder gods
[1:12:13] <+dream__center> she's an alien
[1:12:14] <TopTierHarley> make sure to put it in tourney mode @WoolieVersus
[1:12:16] <nmaten> boooo

[1:12:25] <Aussie_Manny> Wow, Reggie.
[1:12:28] <@Solidus_113> She's an alien
[1:12:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Aww hell naw Reggie
[1:12:31] <+evbites> look it's space paige
[1:12:31] <Ookamiden02> wow
[1:12:32] <0rond> jesus leo you didn't have to decapitate her
[1:12:34] <StarkMaximum> @democrazyyy So basically he's someone who argues on Twitter
[1:12:35] <raikagelord1> Wow Reggie
[1:12:35] <Dante_Namikaze1> Her hair is fiery
[1:12:38] <%reknownblackcat> Reggie with the sick Iron Maiden shirt
[1:12:39] <%reknownblackcat> nice
[1:12:41] <dinnydanny777> What is a teen titan
[1:12:43] <+ZacharyWile> The subtitles are for the story mode
[1:12:44] <Aussie_Manny> She's an... aaaaaaalien.
[1:12:44] <anuchallengertwitch> I love that intro for the turtles where they try to calm down, point their finger, then attack
[1:12:45] <%JustYudha> But Reggie, Raven shows feet
[1:12:46] <+Estuko> WOOLIEWATCHES TEEN TITANS
[1:12:47] <maxpasta> What about live action star fire
[1:12:48] <RedHotBoss> I dont read comics, but I never saw fire hair before this game
[1:12:58] <0rond> starfire has that johnny fireball
[1:13:00] <wibbwobbler> oof
[1:13:01] <+dream__center> imagine chat tryign to tell zoomers 20 years later what Teen Titans are when they ask about iut
[1:13:01] <Aussie_Manny> IT'S STILL TERRIBAD D:
[1:13:02] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[1:13:04] <Dante_Namikaze1> Starfire is another good character
[1:13:06] <anuchallengertwitch> 2003 Leonardo is my favorite btw
[1:13:07] <Aussie_Manny> NotLikeThis
[1:13:16] <StarkMaximum> OKAY THAT WAS CUTE
[1:13:24] <TeepPhoenix> Starfire's power laser is pretty powerful
[1:13:27] <SomersaultJustice> oh no he's neat
[1:13:31] <raikagelord1> @anuchallengertwitch 2003 TMNT is the best.
[1:13:32] <Aussie_Manny> fuckin donny LUL
[1:13:38] <+dream__center> so the turtles play marvel with strikers/assists?
[1:13:47] <%reknownblackcat> Leo is Captain Commando for sure
[1:13:47] <TeepPhoenix> Just Leo
[1:13:48] <townzzzzz> high fives all around
[1:13:55] <+dream__center> Captain Commando indeed
[1:13:57] <%doomerskeletor13> These are both DLC characters
[1:14:00] <maxpasta> Lol he just swallowed an entire slice of pizza without chewing
[1:14:02] <deafmelone> Just blame nrs for that stuff i guess
[1:14:03] <RedHotBoss> TOASTY reference
[1:14:04] <+CryptusMaximus> Leo's the best character solely because he uses all the turtles.
[1:14:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> starfire is an rad character. just ignore her new 52 run with Speedy and Red Hood
[1:14:19] <+evbites> TMNT animated movie raph is my favorite since he dresses up in black biker armor
[1:14:21] <@Solidus_113> just think of the freezes as extended hitstop
[1:14:22] <Aussie_Manny> omg this is better than the Ginyu Force in DBFZ.
[1:14:29] <+dream__center> PUNISH
[1:14:31] <TeepPhoenix> You can see the cooldown on the bottom with the strikers
[1:14:33] <Aussie_Manny> OH NOOOOO
[1:14:35] <StarkMaximum> STARFIRE HE CAN'T BREATHE UP THERE
[1:14:36] <Dante_Namikaze1> @morcego_cinzento_arts the same could be said for Red Hood and Arsenal
[1:14:37] <StarkMaximum> STARFIRE HE'S ALREADY DEAD
[1:14:40] <+dream__center> She's an Alien
[1:14:42] <+jiggy_snipe> geez Starfire
[1:14:44] <Aussie_Manny> f
[1:14:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Look at brainiac just vibing in the back
[1:14:46] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts I agree
[1:14:49] <TeepPhoenix> Also, this is a reference to the TT cartoon intro
[1:14:58] <0rond> is the 2003 cartoon the one where they were in the future for a while?
[1:14:59] <fantom_flasch> Teen Titans show saved Starfire from just being SpaceTHOT
[1:15:04] <TeepPhoenix> With the throwing of the lasers
[1:15:04] <cgame_me811> doodThirst
[1:15:06] <tearfuldevil> @TeepPhoenix YEYEYE I SEE IT
[1:15:08] <+dream__center> Brainiac is sorta... interseting in this game
[1:15:13] <deafmelone> that explosion just barely moved those rocks
[1:15:17] <+Doc1790> Starfire is pretty broken in this game
[1:15:19] <+dream__center> red hood is kinda cool in this game sorta
[1:15:21] <tearfuldevil> yeah starfires character outside of the teen titans show was
[1:15:22] <StarkMaximum> Hey chat experts, this game got any grapplers?
[1:15:26] <tearfuldevil> uh, not great
[1:15:27] <+Posh_Cat> We Played red hood yet?
[1:15:30] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Dante_Namikaze1 That entire ark was an miss fire.
[1:15:30] <+dream__center> Bane, Gorilla Grodd
[1:15:31] <TeepPhoenix> Red Hood is not nonlethal
[1:15:33] <anuchallengertwitch> @raikagelord1 2003 tmnt also had the hypest intro
[1:15:34] <powerprotoman> HES HYPER LETHAL
[1:15:34] <+Posh_Cat> Niiice
[1:15:35] <+evbites> cowards
[1:15:38] <MasterCosmic> Never killed anyone :)

[1:16:57] <Dante_Namikaze1> @spardanwarrior no he beat him savagely with the crowbar the explosion killed him
[1:16:59] <+ZacharyWile> @jiggy_snipe He died. Superboy punched a mirror that represented the universe, and it altered events so that Jason was still alive.
[1:16:59] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:17:02] <TopTierHarley> it's also his wakeup
[1:17:02] <%NeedlesD> meterburn
[1:17:04] <Mach5Mike> doodLUL
[1:17:06] <raikagelord1> Red Hood is just not cool in games.
[1:17:08] <+Doc1790> @Jason Todd is corpsing
[1:17:14] <+AngriestAngryArtist> NRS game design!!
[1:17:16] <BalloniWright> @morcego_cinzento_arts He was working with Batman again
[1:17:17] <cgame_me811> doodLUL
[1:17:18] <+jiggy_snipe> tactical back dive
[1:17:21] <+dream__center> yeah Red Hood has the movement stuff along with his short range gun play
[1:17:22] <+Posh_Cat> The better move sets were the ones with the traps and air shots
[1:17:25] <Aussie_Manny> DDT!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:17:26] <raikagelord1> Meter burn let’s you shoot
[1:17:29] <ShakeTheW> You gotta mash during the supers bruh
[1:17:32] <deafmelone> Nrs animations man lol
[1:17:45] <TopTierHarley> nope he's a top tier
[1:17:49] <+dream__center> usually teh low attacks are where NRS animations shine ;)
[1:17:56] <+dream__center> the classic d3 :D
[1:17:59] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Pre NRS animation fix? They still jank as hell in MK11
[1:18:01] <TeepPhoenix> Red lantern!
[1:18:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> speaking of robins and crwobars. my fave line in this game against Batman that he doesn't even have an comeback to "you don't kill but you're fine with permanent brain damage?"
[1:18:06] <%democrazyyy> Joker looks wack in this one cause he's a hallucination iirx
[1:18:09] <%democrazyyy> iirc*
[1:18:12] <prime_name> Edge boi Robin
[1:18:12] <raikagelord1> @democrazyyy oh yeah people did vote to kill Jason.
[1:18:13] <+dream__center> NRS and janky animations are forever a duo
[1:18:13] <%JustYudha> Uh oh here comes the stutters during the smoke bombs
[1:18:16] <Aussie_Manny> Is that Damian?
[1:18:17] <Mach5Mike> "Fence Punching"
[1:18:19] <anuchallengertwitch> I liked the version of Red Hood from Batman the Brave and the Bold, that one was an alternate universe Joker who fights back his insanity and is a good guy
[1:18:20] <%BisoromiBear> 11 almost looks decent
[1:18:20] <TeepPhoenix> Yes, that
[1:18:21] <+dream__center> I think its Damian
[1:18:22] <BreakersAweigh> damian's a garbo robin tho
[1:18:22] <dinnydanny777> Is the sword non lethal too?
[1:18:23] <%NeedlesD> Yes it's Damian
[1:18:23] <Dante_Namikaze1> that because its Damian
[1:18:25] <brunoberserk> IT WAS ME BARRY
[1:18:26] <BalloniWright> I'm sorry chat I think Damian is super cool
[1:18:27] <raikagelord1> I hate this Damian.
[1:18:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Damian PogChamp
[1:18:28] <+Story_Ark> Fuck damian. Damians a PoS robin
[1:18:40] <TopTierHarley> Don't have to charge, just a back heavy
[1:18:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:18:43] <+balouie> I like damian just not injustice damian
[1:18:45] <@Solidus_113> Dab with the Speedforce
[1:18:46] <Pyrrhus90> best super in the game
[1:18:49] <+dream__center> Damian is the assassin prodigy whose 'just a kid'
[1:18:51] <Parapattern> Man, Batman: Under the Red Hood was so good
[1:18:55] <+Story_Ark> Damian can be cool, but hes awful in Injustice
[1:18:56] <TeepPhoenix> Thing about Barry in this game he keeps narcing on Blue Beetle and Firestorm and Harley to Batman when they goof off
[1:18:57] <+evbites> oh never mind heres the edgiest member of the batfamily
[1:18:58] <dinnydanny777> Is this the angry Robin from the movie?
[1:18:59] <%democrazyyy> I thought Damian was evil Nightwing in the first game???
[1:19:01] <raikagelord1> I like regular Damian but whiny Damian sucks.
[1:19:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @BalloniWright and i guess he just had to bow to the bat and accept the no kill rule? that is lame right away
[1:19:04] <%democrazyyy> why's he Robin here
[1:19:05] <Mach5Mike> DCAU Damian I'm okay with, not Injustice Damian
[1:19:18] <wqorst> why does flash keep glitching
[1:19:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Nah Damian is cool, just Injustice necessitates characters being evil
[1:19:20] <BreakersAweigh> Flash has the best super in the game. CLEAN
[1:19:20] <+evbites> @democrazyyy he played it back
[1:19:22] <deafmelone> This stage doesnt have transitions.
[1:19:26] <tearfuldevil> @Mach5Mike even DCAU Damian is kind of wanked to shit
[1:19:31] <Dante_Namikaze1> @anuchallengertwitch that's because it's in earth 3 where everyone's morality is flipped
[1:19:37] <BreakersAweigh> CLEAN
[1:19:42] <+dream__center> I think Tim drake went a different direction around this time too int he comics?
[1:19:45] <FutaSnek> Probably the best super this gen
[1:19:46] <FutaSnek> ngl
[1:19:47] <+dream__center> I could be wrong tho
[1:19:48] <raikagelord1> I hope we get Static Shock for the next game.
[1:19:55] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Robin has some good animation tho.
[1:19:59] <+dream__center> pay PHil Lamar his monis
[1:20:03] <tearfuldevil> @Mach5Mike in his first appearance he
[1:20:04] <anuchallengertwitch> @Dante_Namikaze1 he's still a cool character. He fights with spades and playing cards
[1:20:05] <powerprotoman> static is a costume for raiden
[1:20:05] <Mach5Mike> @tearfuldevil To be fair, I said "okay", not "great"
[1:20:06] <+Story_Ark> i feel tim doesnt get respect
[1:20:12] <tearfuldevil> @Mach5Mike tru
[1:20:15] <TeepPhoenix> Back-heavy also activates the stage transition
[1:20:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i feel like the one of the most puzzling things in the Injustice games is teh reworking of Diana's character
[1:20:22] <+dream__center> ask HOneybee for Flash stuff
[1:20:22] <+Story_Ark> Tim Drake i genuinely like as Robin but he gets overshadowed hard
[1:20:22] <+evbites> his cape and hood looks so dumb
[1:20:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Now that the rights to Static are cleared up I’d bet on him being in 3 tbh
[1:20:28] <+dmtjinni> no cap
[1:20:29] <Dante_Namikaze1> @tearfuldevil it's more than kind of he beat Deathstroke solo with a broken arm
[1:20:30] <prime_name> @powerprotoman isn't that Black Thunder or whatever?
[1:20:30] <%democrazyyy> I wish he was using that reverse flash skin
[1:20:36] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> is this the Bible Black channel?
[1:20:39] <anuchallengertwitch> @morcego_cinzento_arts yeah Injustice Diana is just a bitch
[1:20:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes
[1:20:41] <+Story_Ark> Oh Diana SUUUCKS in Injustice. probably the worst
[1:20:42] <TeepPhoenix> Black Lightning is in this one as a Raiden Alt
[1:20:47] <powerprotoman> could be i genuinely forgot liek 90% of whats in this game
[1:20:50] <+dream__center> IJ wonder woman? LEL
[1:20:52] <%Josef_Stryker> Best Super
[1:20:53] <%democrazyyy> and that John Stewart's skin was just green lantern in this game instead of being Hal Jordan again
[1:21:01] <FutaSnek> I like Diana in Injustice shes just a warrior who wants to fight and really dosnt give a fuck about much else LUL
[1:21:05] <+jiggy_snipe> that T-Rex got owned lol
[1:21:07] <+evbites> tim should have stayed the last robin gt outta here rape baby Damien
[1:21:09] <tearfuldevil> @Dante_Namikaze1 tbf fuck deathstroke, he SHOULD be a joke, he's an edgy pedo
[1:21:09] <StarkMaximum> Flash be like "I'll hit a motherfucker WITH ANOTHER MOTHERFUCKER"
[1:21:10] <deafmelone> as flash slides his feet across the ground
[1:21:16] <+dmtjinni> got got
[1:21:22] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts she basically like her flashpoint version but only less tyrannical
[1:21:23] <+dream__center> yeah IJ verse characters are not their best I'd say
[1:21:24] <%democrazyyy> I'll hit a motherfucker with himself
[1:21:31] <anuchallengertwitch> Flash should be cooler than he is considering his powers
[1:21:33] <+Story_Ark> Diana made Clark her simp
[1:21:35] <TeepPhoenix> Flash in this game is kind of like Geras in MK11
[1:21:37] <%NeedlesD> Do it
[1:21:40] <+dream__center> ICE KLONE
[1:21:47] <stabbityrabbit> Yeah, Hellboy time.
[1:21:50] <+dream__center> SELENA KYLE
[1:21:50] <cgame_me811> Best super

[1:21:59] <%democrazyyy> WOW that slap LUL
[1:22:00] <dinnydanny777> Fuck that basketball scene
[1:22:00] <Mach5Mike> That smile XD
[1:22:00] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @anuchallengertwitch Basically poisoned Super's grieving mind into ripping off Red Son
[1:22:01] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[1:22:03] <StarkMaximum> OH NOOOO
[1:22:07] <powerprotoman> OH RIGHT Static is in the mobile game
[1:22:09] <cipher758> lol fuckin hell
[1:22:10] <%hamahiroyuki> the t-rex didnt even bite. flash did that just to annoy him? LUL
[1:22:11] <+evbites> Cringe
[1:22:11] <prime_name> WHAT
[1:22:12] <FutaSnek> oooooooh noooooo
[1:22:14] <dinnydanny777> That Basketball scene makes me feel sick
[1:22:14] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, but Anne Hathaway tho. Kappa
[1:22:21] <+dream__center> oh yeah Catwoman was kinda silly for a bit too
[1:22:21] <wibbwobbler> thank you woolie brb
[1:22:22] <anuchallengertwitch> No love for Eartha Kitt Catwoman
[1:22:23] <Dante_Namikaze1> @tearfuldevil he may be a pedometer sometimes but he should always outclass Damian since he's Nightwing's rival and he at the same level of skill as Batamn
[1:22:25] <therealtacopancakes> hellboy looks mignola crisp, love it
[1:22:25] <TeepPhoenix> What about Eartha Kitt, guys?
[1:22:26] <+dream__center> Semiij had the catwoman in tourneys
[1:22:34] <+Story_Ark> I think Halle would actually be super hot as Catwoman. but man that movie didnt do any favors
[1:22:36] <anuchallengertwitch> @TeepPhoenix There we go.
[1:22:36] <cgame_me811> @futasnek Pretty much
[1:22:38] <+evbites> i love hellboy's stupid big gun
[1:22:43] <+dream__center> yeah Hellboy is pretty cool, outside of some mirroring weirdness
[1:22:44] <Aussie_Manny> ONE PUUUUUUUUNCH
[1:22:45] <TopTierHarley> you don't have to charge them up
[1:22:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m excited for Zoe Kravitz to be Catwoman
[1:22:48] <dinnydanny777> Eartha Kitt was actually super hot back in the day right?
[1:22:50] <cgame_me811> Woolie please doodLUL
[1:22:50] <ShakeTheW> Catwoman was the best character in the game at some point
[1:22:54] <Aussie_Manny> Horns and crown.
[1:22:54] <dinnydanny777> She was a singer too I think
[1:22:57] <TeepPhoenix> I hate hellboy in this game because he has Wonder Woman's random buff
[1:22:57] <+dmtjinni> Whats Hell Boy deal?
[1:22:58] <+dream__center> oh zoe kravitz :P
[1:23:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 Pretty much. between those two. Attack of teh Amazon's and how the New 52 explain how the amazons reproduce. i guess they really want to make all amazonians bloodthristy bitches
[1:23:07] <+dream__center> Ron Perlman as Hellboy :D
[1:23:08] <cgame_me811> Catwoman doodThirst
[1:23:12] <@akuda_bar> @dmtjinni son of a witch and a demon, basically
[1:23:14] <tearfuldevil> @Dante_Namikaze1 nah, he's jsut an edgy weeb suepr soldier, and if they don't want to treat his criems seriously he should be treated as a joke
[1:23:15] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts sadly
[1:23:18] <anuchallengertwitch> Man RIP Eartha Kitt. One of my favorite voice actors
[1:23:21] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhhh, is it Ron Pearlman voicing him?? PogChamp
[1:23:23] <%huskarl_zap> >comics Kappa
[1:23:26] <%democrazyyy> that thing out there just ate a sharks head off
[1:23:27] <TeepPhoenix> It's not Ron.
[1:23:29] <%doomerskeletor13> @morcego_cinzento_arts They walked all that back after Rebirth
[1:23:29] <%democrazyyy> rad
[1:23:31] <@akuda_bar> yeah that aint ron
[1:23:32] <TopTierHarley> you do not have to charge the b3 or f3
[1:23:33] <townzzzzz> the big hand switching is so dumb
[1:23:33] <%emperordread> Can we all take a second to acknowledge that being into Catwoman that way makes you a furry?
[1:23:40] <Aussie_Manny> Not Pearlman? Awwww... BibleThump
[1:23:43] <+sababu1> @morcego_cinzento_arts could you enlighten me on HOW they reproduce. I'm wildly curious now
[1:23:44] <+Story_Ark> Hey chat idk if they mentioned why but why is Woolie's mic so bad?
[1:23:46] <@akuda_bar> wait why tf does his hand switch sides
[1:23:57] <TeepPhoenix> Keep in mind that in one episode of Batman TAS she actually turned into a furry
[1:23:58] <@Solidus_113> cat woman is not furry
[1:23:58] <anuchallengertwitch> @emperordread no that's Cheetah
[1:24:00] <+dream__center> @akuda_bar yeah theats thew eirdness i'm talking about
[1:24:01] <stabbityrabbit> I forgot that they didn't make Hellboy's huge fuck-off gun his trait. That thing always seemed too good to just be a normal special to me.
[1:24:05] <+evbites> @emperordread no thats what cheetah is for
[1:24:05] <%NeedlesD> @akuda_bar because of the model flip
[1:24:06] <+dream__center> weith hellboys stance switch animations or shit
[1:24:11] <@akuda_bar> that's fucked up lol
[1:24:12] <Aussie_Manny> Ooooooof
[1:24:13] <%NeedlesD> yeah
[1:24:16] <FutaSnek> Cat woman is like 5% furry
[1:24:20] <ShakeTheW> Matrix super
[1:24:21] <Dante_Namikaze1> @emperordread no it just means you wanna get whipped
[1:24:24] <raikagelord1> I wanna see Etrigan for Injustice 3
[1:24:27] <%NeedlesD> its the reason Freddy had 2 gloves in MK9
[1:24:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:24:32] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @doomerskeletor13 after the new 52 i didn't accompanied much of teh rebirth stuff. so i guess they fixed an ton of mistakes
[1:24:33] <dinnydanny777> That's pretty funny
[1:24:33] <anuchallengertwitch> Catwoman is as much of a furry as Batman is
[1:24:33] <%doomerskeletor13> ETRIGAN HELL YEAH
[1:24:34] <%emperordread> @Solidus_113 she has a literal fursona, and an expensive suit to dress up in!
[1:24:37] <+dream__center> I didn't knwo if Etrigan was that popular
[1:24:38] <TeepPhoenix> She totally did the Trinity from the Matrix moves
[1:24:39] <+evbites> Cheetah 100% furry
[1:24:39] <BalloniWright> LUL
[1:24:41] <Aussie_Manny> Since when was Catwoman's thin a motorbike?
[1:24:44] <therealtacopancakes> was that a matrix reference?
[1:24:48] <TopTierHarley> yes
[1:24:49] <anuchallengertwitch> @emperordread so does bruce
[1:24:51] <FutaSnek> Cheetah is 200% furry
[1:24:54] <@Solidus_113> Catwoman is hard BDSM
[1:24:54] <TopTierHarley> it was a matrix ref
[1:24:58] <+dream__center> at least Hellboy seemed to have potential due to trying to release him as DLC
[1:24:58] <+Story_Ark> never forget bruce straight up kissed cheetah in JL
[1:25:01] <ha2ken> I want to believe that she nabbed Batman's motorcycle and uses it
[1:25:02] <TeepPhoenix> The second one was GDT also
[1:25:06] <@akuda_bar> first two were amazing, new one was butt
[1:25:06] <%democrazyyy> I wanna see some Dr fate in here
[1:25:07] <%emperordread> @anuchallengertwitch oh no..... oh no ..... cursed knowledge
[1:25:09] <%NeedlesD> second was also Del Toro
[1:25:10] <%BisoromiBear> you missed nothing
[1:25:11] <+Story_Ark> GDT did the first two
[1:25:13] <ShakeTheW> Hellboy 2 is better than the first
[1:25:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @sababu1 In the new 52? once in the while when they need babies they will hijack an passing ship, rape all the men and kill them
[1:25:14] <%Proxzo> Golden Army had some cool parts
[1:25:15] <@Solidus_113> Golden Army was fun
[1:25:15] <+dream__center> oh eyah Ivy is another zoner type char I think
[1:25:16] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus second was GDT as well
[1:25:16] <%democrazyyy> poke
[1:25:18] <Dante_Namikaze1> it was the first 2 and yes both of those were good
[1:25:22] <BalloniWright> OH THEY FUCKING
[1:25:22] <+Story_Ark> Hellboy 2 is great yall
[1:25:25] <+dream__center> Swamp Thing is... interesting in thisg ame
[1:25:26] <StarkMaximum> Poison Ivy dead-ass almost did the Three Stooges eye poke
[1:25:27] <wibbwobbler> im in love with poison ivy
[1:25:30] <joegoblins> Second was great too!
[1:25:31] <tearfuldevil> man this fight would be SUCH A REMATCH
[1:25:31] <+BottledLineArt> The Del Toro Hellboy movies were both pretty good.
[1:25:32] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhh, these two should have some dialogue!
[1:25:36] <tearfuldevil> such a mismatch, i mean
[1:25:39] <+dream__center> Swamp Ass
[1:25:40] <+DrJamesWoods> Bane
[1:25:41] <+Posh_Cat> Plant fight! kiwoIron
[1:25:41] <spardanwarrior> Bane

[1:25:44] <ShakeTheW> Green furries
[1:25:46] <anuchallengertwitch> Batman vs TMNT is a great movie
[1:25:46] <prime_name> Time for piss-fights over the Green
[1:25:47] <dinnydanny777> Why did they go super violent and edgy on the new Hellbot but the fucking Guillermo Del Toro movie somehow both isn't super violent or edgy at all
[1:25:48] <Dante_Namikaze1> *Bane
[1:25:49] <%doomerskeletor13> They both love the Green
[1:25:52] <+maenos2> doesn't swamp thing fuck? like a LOT?

[1:26:00] <morcego_cinzento_arts> One awesome detail is that in the arcade story ending for Hellboy, they got Mignola to do teh artwork
[1:26:06] <tearfuldevil> @maenos2 some, he has a kid
[1:26:06] <+Story_Ark> plant titties
[1:26:07] <Exillion_44> swamp thing has my favorite throw animation in the game purely due to how funny i find the impact
[1:26:08] <+dream__center> Harley is okay in this game last I thought
[1:26:11] <@Solidus_113> look at shitty superman being lame in the background
[1:26:14] <TeepPhoenix> Swamp Thing doesn't have a dick so he had to get John Constatine to do it for him
[1:26:15] <DontChuckle98> Wow. You just realized the plant thing? Lol
[1:26:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @StarkMaximum
[1:26:20] <tearfuldevil> @maenos2 he had to borrow a human body to do it
[1:26:20] <Dante_Namikaze1> @evbites even Cheeta and Catwoman
[1:26:22] <StarkMaximum> oops lol my bad
[1:26:24] <+dream__center> yeah Swamp has mad utility for his game
[1:26:25] <FutaSnek> More like Jobberman
[1:26:27] <TopTierHarley> you don't have to charge the forward or back heavy @WoolieVersus
[1:26:28] <+dream__center> but its odd to use at first
[1:26:29] <StarkMaximum> His crouch just has him sink into the ground!
[1:26:37] <+maenos2> @tearfuldevil ah ok. I just remember hearing something about him getting around.
[1:26:37] <+Story_Ark> Swamp Thing's crouch is hilarious looking
[1:26:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i love that Ivy just has those Shop of Little Horros plants on her back
[1:26:54] <TeepPhoenix> Yeah? Wait until you see her super
[1:26:55] <ha2ken> If Groot got mutated
[1:26:57] <wqorst> the big dumb hand lol

[1:27:17] <+Story_Ark> I cant remember, is swamp thing a villain or hero?
[1:27:17] <DontChuckle98> I love how that play with Swamp Thing’s morphing
[1:27:20] <ley38> lytFIRSTTRY yoooo injustice 2!!!!
[1:27:26] <TeepPhoenix> Hero, technically
[1:27:26] <%democrazyyy> fucking DEAD
[1:27:28] <tearfuldevil> @ZacharyWile its fine, swamp thing borrows a human body when its sexy times
[1:27:30] <anuchallengertwitch> Lethal
[1:27:30] <@Solidus_113> ouch

[1:27:39] <+evbites> nature reggie
[1:27:43] <dinnydanny777> Is Swamp Thing a scaly?
[1:27:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> You make my heart sing
[1:27:46] <+dream__center> Force of NATURE
[1:27:46] <cipher758> the green
[1:27:46] <TeepPhoenix> And that body was John Constatine
[1:27:46] <Aussie_Manny> Guardian of the Green!
[1:27:51] <tearfuldevil> @dinnydanny777 no hes a plant
[1:27:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> @evbites in the show it was left to interpretation until Batman Beyond
[1:27:55] <+dream__center> VapeNation
[1:27:58] <cgame_me811> Swamything doodmaxhype
[1:27:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Guardian of the Green baby
[1:28:00] <dinnydanny777> Is Killer Croc a scaly?
[1:28:01] <RedHotBoss> i knew you would like him, hes who most grundy mains swapped to
[1:28:03] <Parapattern> Swamp thing is so OP
[1:28:05] <+xerotwo> doodLewd
[1:28:07] <+RaveBV> SWAMPED
[1:28:09] <tearfuldevil> thats SO WRONG lol
[1:28:10] <anuchallengertwitch> I kind of want to see a Joker fighting game character based off The Batman 2003
[1:28:12] <anuchallengertwitch> 2004
[1:28:13] <therealtacopancakes> he is the green, he is every plant
[1:28:14] <TeepPhoenix> Swamp thing is OP in universe
[1:28:14] <%hamahiroyuki> the leaves are the feathers
[1:28:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the leaf wings are awesome
[1:28:24] <tearfuldevil> swamp thing is SOOOOOO much more powerful than Ivy its sad
[1:28:27] <DontChuckle98> I just noticed and forgot Superman was in the cage. Lol
[1:28:28] <+dream__center> mother nature incarnate
[1:28:29] <cipher758> lol he's great
[1:28:29] <raikagelord1> Swamp thing is super cool but I don’t think he is Top Tier in this game.
[1:28:38] <Dante_Namikaze1> Swamp Thing is cool it's a shame his show got canceled after its first episode
[1:28:42] <+dream__center> yeah so Ivy is another char that prefers to fight and setup long range
[1:28:47] <cgame_me811> Poison ivy gameplay WutFace
[1:28:52] <+dream__center> oh yeah she can summon a spitter thing too
[1:28:55] <TeepPhoenix> Swamp thing is like a hive mind with all the plants in the area
[1:29:17] <TeepPhoenix> If you see his body like this, it's only because he wants you to
[1:29:19] <+RaveBV> Swamp thing is "the green" in DC. The Green is basically like a force of nature, meaning it's every kind of plant around. You can't really kill Swamp thing if other plants exist, because he'll continue existing through them.
[1:29:20] <BreakersAweigh> RESPECT THE EARTH
[1:29:21] <RedHotBoss> im gonna plant me a dumbass tree!!!
[1:29:23] <Aussie_Manny> A saibamen!
[1:29:25] <tearfuldevil> he can control all the plants on a continental+ scale, can teleport from planet to planet, and he doesn't have a physical body, while ivy is jsut ahuman
[1:29:25] <+dream__center> yes it does
[1:29:25] <@Solidus_113> who's the Batgirl in this game?
[1:29:29] <dinnydanny777> Swamp Thing telling Poison Ivy to respect the Earth huh
[1:29:31] <ArkhamBenji> Eco Warriors!
[1:29:36] <+Story_Ark> Barbara?
[1:29:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Swamp Thing used to be an human but now he is more like an unique sapient that is also an avatar for earth's plant life
[1:29:40] <BalloniWright> "Respect the Earth or leave" PogChamp
[1:29:41] <+dream__center> i don't remember a batgirl comaprison in this game
[1:29:42] <%doomerskeletor13> There is no Batgirl in this game iirc
[1:29:45] <TeepPhoenix> Also, you have to block Swampie's super low
[1:29:45] <raikagelord1> “Respect the earth or leave.”? LUL
[1:29:50] <wqorst> LUL
[1:29:50] <@Solidus_113> I mean in terms of gameplay
[1:29:55] <+dream__center> NRS made sure SonicFox breaks another character in the game
[1:29:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Ohhh
[1:29:57] <%democrazyyy> knee slap!
[1:29:58] <%Josef_Stryker> DENIED

[1:30:08] <cipher758> don't litter!
[1:30:09] <+dream__center> nah Black Adam is black adam
[1:30:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Poison Ivy while mutated is still an human being that happens to have an obcession with plant life
[1:30:13] <%doomerskeletor13> WOW
[1:30:18] <+dream__center> Black Adam was strong in IJ1 as he was in IJ2
[1:30:24] <TeepPhoenix> RED LANTERN
[1:30:26] <+dream__center> atrocitus is kinda funny tho
[1:30:27] <+Story_Ark> Black Adam is Dwayne Johnson
[1:30:30] <+dream__center> he got that psycho cat
[1:30:31] <TeepPhoenix> DOCTOR FATE IS A JABRONI
[1:30:31] <dinnydanny777> Is Swamp Thing a villain?
[1:30:38] <%doomerskeletor13> in some stories Ivy becomes connected to the Green
[1:30:38] <HelghastTroop> is that a ninja turtle to the right?
[1:30:39] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[1:30:40] <TeepPhoenix> Swamp Thing is a hero
[1:30:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> @solidus_113 no one has that kind of playstyle in this game
[1:30:41] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie isn't much of a DC guy?
[1:30:42] <BreakersAweigh> REGGIE
[1:30:43] <+dream__center> LMAOOOO
[1:30:45] <prime_name> @dinnydanny777 Good guy
[1:30:45] <TopTierHarley> no @dinnydanny777
[1:30:45] <Ookamiden02> LUL
[1:30:46] <+Story_Ark> Do they have the costumes?
[1:30:46] <Pyrrhus90> LUL
[1:30:46] <+RaveBV> Poison Ivy is too obsessed with plants and forces the natural balance of things. I guess she isn't really respecting nature doing it's thing normally?
[1:30:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Doctor Fate is rad
[1:30:50] <tearfuldevil> hal is so lame i hate him
[1:30:51] <+xerotwo> doodLUL
[1:30:53] <StarkMaximum> I deadass thought he was dabbing
[1:30:55] <%democrazyyy> @woolieversus there's a alternate skin for green lantern that's John Stewart
[1:30:55] <dinnydanny777> Even Ryan Reynolds thinks that movie is bad
[1:30:56] <DontChuckle98> Shut up, Reggie! Lol
[1:30:57] <HelghastTroop> i had no idea ninja turtles was a character in this
[1:31:01] <+dream__center> i forgot if Green latern was good in IJ2
[1:31:02] <prime_name> Steve Blum Lantern!
[1:31:07] <HelghastTroop> thats cool
[1:31:09] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus Green Lantern has an alt with Stewart in this game
[1:31:09] <cgame_me811> But in terms of her gameplay I don’t know
[1:31:10] <+evbites> is john not an alternate in this one
[1:31:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Supergirl PogChamp
[1:31:13] <TeepPhoenix> GL sucks in this game
[1:31:14] <+dream__center> SuperGirl is actually good in this game
[1:31:17] <wibbwobbler> I'm in love with supergirl
[1:31:20] <Aussie_Manny> Laura Bailey?
[1:31:25] <%Josef_Stryker> Laura Bailey
[1:31:26] <+dream__center> has superman like traits but more mobility
[1:31:30] <anuchallengertwitch> Anyone remeber the 2004 The Batman ?
[1:31:34] <+evbites> power girl is where it's at
[1:31:34] <+dream__center> and good armor on some stuff

[1:31:34] <cgame_me811> Yeah
[1:31:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I righly suggest the CG series of Hal Jordan
[1:31:39] <+Story_Ark> And Supergirl has a Power Girl alt
[1:31:39] <TeepPhoenix> Supergirl has cool eye laser powers
[1:31:40] <dinnydanny777> Did Supergirl just vomit?
[1:31:43] <Dante_Namikaze1> Sojourn is the second weeb Green Lantern
[1:31:46] <+dream__center> oh yeah there is a power girl skin in this game I think
[1:31:50] <+Story_Ark> id be ok if she vomit on me tbh
[1:31:51] <tearfuldevil> @dinnydanny777 freeze breath lol
[1:31:54] <+dream__center> She is very good in this game
[1:32:01] <raikagelord1> Not Guy Gardner the true Minority?
[1:32:02] <%DensityD> FORM VOLTRON
[1:32:05] <brunoberserk> hey woolie , supergirl have a powergirl costume
[1:32:08] <Aussie_Manny> FORM UP
[1:32:09] <ha2ken> Hulk Buster
[1:32:12] <Aussie_Manny> LANTERN ZORD
[1:32:12] <+dream__center> that seems more like a Kyle thing to do
[1:32:13] <+jiggy_snipe> isn't Hal stupid?
[1:32:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Jessica Cruz is one of my faves
[1:32:16] <cgame_me811> Woolie please doodLUL
[1:32:17] <SomersaultJustice> And I'll form the head!
[1:32:19] <+dream__center> than a Hal thing but I dunno
[1:32:25] <DontChuckle98> Wow. That’s the most imaginative thing I’ve seen Hal make. Lol
[1:32:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @dream__center yep, there is. including an different voice and an much bigger pair
[1:32:32] <chll0ne> isnt simon baz a certified weeb
[1:32:33] <Bennett_Fracture> that robot was actually kid jhon stewart idea...
[1:32:34] <%NeedlesD> that is more of a Kyle construct for sure
[1:32:35] <Ookamiden02> that's why Kyle is the coolest
[1:32:36] <+dream__center> boobie window POwer Gal
[1:32:36] <+jiggy_snipe> I thought he lacked imagination so BIG FIST
[1:32:39] <StarkMaximum> I mean to be fair that super is a much more fun one to watch than "I'll just make a BIGGER FIST"
[1:32:40] <TeepPhoenix> You also have to have willpower to supplement your creativity as a GL
[1:32:47] <+Story_Ark> Power Girl alt is the best alt
[1:32:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:56] <Ookamiden02> That's tottally more Kyle
[1:32:56] <BreakersAweigh> KARA PLEASE
[1:32:58] <Bennett_Fracture> justice league when the league turned into kids...
[1:32:58] <+Story_Ark> also John Stewart
[1:32:58] <+Doc1790> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH
[1:33:02] <%doomerskeletor13> brownS
[1:33:05] <DontChuckle98> Yep. Dead.
[1:33:07] <+dream__center> John Stewart's constructs are more detailed
[1:33:08] <Aussie_Manny> Power Girl.
[1:33:12] <TeepPhoenix> Some GLs can create complex constructs, some can create more solid and powerful constructs
[1:33:13] <wibbwobbler> lol
[1:33:13] <%NeedlesD> you're right about that
[1:33:15] <+dream__center> from his engineer background
[1:33:19] <+Story_Ark> Power Girl is an alt in the game
[1:33:21] <%democrazyyy> power girl and John stewart are both skins in game
[1:33:26] <%democrazyyy> and reverse flash
[1:33:28] <Bennett_Fracture> thank you story_ark...
[1:33:30] <Dante_Namikaze1> Power Girl is an older alternate universe version of Supergirl
[1:33:32] <tearfuldevil> @DontChuckle98 tbf he uses like, jet engines and stuff, soemtimes? which are more complex than anything guy gardner does
[1:33:33] <+dream__center> super girl def strong in this game
[1:33:33] <+Story_Ark> np
[1:33:34] <+RaveBV> Isn't that space thing a pre-rendered background video wit the char models just doing their thing over it?
[1:33:35] <%NeedlesD> and Mr. Freeze
[1:33:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Power Girl is just an alt universe Supergirl
[1:33:43] <+dream__center> try BLAQ ADAM
[1:33:45] <dinnydanny777> Is the Supergirl tv show any good?
[1:33:48] <TeepPhoenix> Yeah, John Steward is the archetypal "powerful but simple" construct GL
[1:33:49] <+UnwoundCaesar70> not black Adam
[1:33:50] <+dream__center> Blaq adam still has the lightning projectile
[1:33:51] <%koolaid_kevster> scarecrffow good
[1:33:53] <+UnwoundCaesar70> NOOOOO
[1:34:00] <prime_name> Crazy Eddie
[1:34:01] <%DensityD> "We modeled all of space, we're not gonna waste it"
[1:34:02] <raikagelord1> Power girl, John Stewart, Reverse Flash etc. are skins.
[1:34:05] <KnivesEve> blue beetle is cool
[1:34:06] <+dream__center> firestorm is also solid in this game. Good projectile char too
[1:34:07] <anuchallengertwitch> man Firestorm was NOTHING in the story mode
[1:34:07] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Crazy Gideon
[1:34:12] <ha2ken> I would like Firestorm's design if not for that big dumb torch head
[1:34:15] <RedHotBoss> what do you mean "black" adam?
[1:34:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:34:17] <+Story_Ark> oh yeah, reverse flash is pretty good too
[1:34:17] <%koolaid_kevster> HOME FIELD
[1:34:18] <+xerotwo> doodLUL
[1:34:19] <%koolaid_kevster> 'ADV
[1:34:20] <Ookamiden02> LUL
[1:34:21] <TeepPhoenix> Black Adam looks like Richard Nixon in this game
[1:34:22] <DontChuckle98> Reggie already won. XD
[1:34:32] <morcego_cinzento_arts> an common theme is that a lot of Hal's green energy construct are more based on either aircraft weapons r sillier stuff. Since john is an marine scout and more sober, hem akes more like hand held automatics or jsut basic beans
[1:34:39] <+dream__center> that lightning atk is so good
[1:34:41] <BreakersAweigh> Firestorm is 2 people fused together iirc
[1:34:50] <%DensityD> "but boss there's no room..." SwiftRage "I DON'T CARE. we modeled space! put it in!"
[1:34:55] <AllTheZibas> That was charging trait it looks like
[1:35:00] <BalloniWright> @anuchallengertwitch At least He makes the Golden Kryptonite that Batman uses to beat Superman
[1:35:01] <prime_name> The body of a freshman and a brain of a professor
[1:35:01] <wibbwobbler> dialogue isn't bad compared to others, more fluid
[1:35:06] <StarkMaximum> "Make Leonardo send them to space, I don't care!"
[1:35:08] <+Story_Ark> yeah, firestorm is a fusion which is why he mentions "the professor"
[1:35:11] <TopTierHarley> the more levels of trait he has the better he is
[1:35:29] <+evbites> @BreakersAweigh an old white guy and his young black student
[1:35:39] <RedHotBoss> see? reggie just calls him Adam
[1:35:41] <+dream__center> so firestorm is a snowballing like char? Builds on his trait to take over a match I guess
[1:35:43] <TeepPhoenix> "it takes two to Firestorm!"
[1:35:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I love Max and Steve's description of Black Adam in this game "He looks like an normal guy. like he owns an store"
[1:36:12] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[1:36:12] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @morcego_cinzento_arts byes his name is Crazy Gideon and he sales electronics
[1:36:13] <TeepPhoenix> "I will not resign"?
[1:36:14] <+dream__center> there is no winning against an opponent with more bar
[1:36:16] <Aussie_Manny> NOT WORTH
[1:36:18] <Aussie_Manny> NOT WORTHH
[1:36:19] <+Story_Ark> jesus this mic
[1:36:20] <RedHotBoss> Dude, I hate the top of his stupid head
[1:36:23] <TopTierHarley> @dream__center once he reaches level 3 he becomes the best in the game
[1:36:25] <+dream__center> yeah Wager is stupid taht way
[1:36:25] <Bennett_Fracture> in the first injustice adam after winning a round would say: ''you are not my equal...''
[1:36:31] <Dante_Namikaze1> L
[1:36:34] <Bennett_Fracture> harsh... really...
[1:36:36] <TeepPhoenix> Harley calls Firestorm an overgrown birthday candle
[1:36:36] <Lordkeyblade> L
[1:36:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @UnwoundCaesar70 "there are no good and evil. Only taxes!"
[1:36:45] <raikagelord1> I would love to See an “Invincible” Character in Injustice 3 despite them more than likely being Supermany.
[1:36:45] <+evbites> i wish lobo was in this game
[1:36:47] <+Nomidname_Davis> L
[1:36:52] <+shivvey> BLUE BEETLE
[1:36:54] <%DensityD> woolieGLORY
[1:36:55] <+dream__center> YESSS BIG GORILLA
[1:36:58] <%DensityD> hmm, monke
[1:37:02] <+dream__center> Grodd is one of funkier chars in this game :)
[1:37:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reject modernity, accept monke
[1:37:05] <StarkMaximum> Who came first, Dr. Fate or Dr. Strange?
[1:37:06] <+shivvey> mmmmmmm monke
[1:37:06] <TeepPhoenix> Blue Beetle is essentially Baraka
[1:37:09] <+iamwood99> MONKEY
[1:37:11] <+evbites> no one does he's just some dick
[1:37:12] <AllTheZibas> Return to monke 🐒
[1:37:15] <+Westlemania26> He's got a sweet helmet
[1:37:15] <+dream__center> big body and big hurtbox but he's got sum stuff
[1:37:18] <TopTierHarley> Beetle is not Baraka
[1:37:19] <Dante_Namikaze1> @starkmaximum Fate did
[1:37:20] <anuchallengertwitch> Dr. Fate was nothing in story mode too
[1:37:22] <Aussie_Manny> Dr Fate loves his ankh.
[1:37:24] <@Solidus_113> galaxy brain monke
[1:37:25] <+dream__center> Dr Prof Fate
[1:37:26] <StarkMaximum> @Dante_Namikaze1 Thank you
[1:37:27] <therealtacopancakes> Fate is an asshole
[1:37:29] <BalloniWright> LUL
[1:37:32] <+dream__center> Fate's also a setup/zoner type char
[1:37:34] <godzookylives> And Professor X
[1:37:37] <prime_name> Dr. Fate simps for the order gods
[1:37:38] <Aussie_Manny> mmm monkey
[1:37:38] <+Doc1790> Dr. Fate is OP as fuck in DC Canon. He can beat Superman if he wanted to.
[1:37:40] <+BAC0N_JESUS> Dr. Fate is a chad
[1:37:45] <+Story_Ark> I mostly know Fate through Young Justice
[1:37:46] <TeepPhoenix> Blue Beetle has Baraka's arm blades, is what I meant
[1:37:46] <afronooch> M O N K E
[1:37:47] <StarkMaximum> That tends to happen for magic-based heroes
[1:37:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Dr Fate is basically possessed by the helmet
[1:37:54] <+dream__center> i mean Dr Fate is a magic based char so he def one ups Superman
[1:37:54] <Aussie_Manny> @Doc1790 so can Martian Manhunter.
[1:37:59] <MichaelOfCainhurst> monke
[1:38:04] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Remember when doctor Fate was an dumbass in Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay? cause i sure do
[1:38:06] <+evbites> dr.fate shows up to say i don't like the script
[1:38:07] <@Solidus_113> Harambe combos?
[1:38:07] <cgame_me811> Killer frost doodSad
[1:38:10] <+lovedartss> add more gorillas in fighting games
[1:38:15] <+dream__center> LETS GO GORILLA
[1:38:15] <+dmtjinni> WANSTON
[1:38:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Bout to be Planet of the Apes up in this bitch
[1:38:22] <Dante_Namikaze1> @doomerskeletor13 Dr. Fate is the Helmet
[1:38:26] <+dream__center> BIG GORI MIXUPS
[1:38:27] <+shivvey> RAISE YOUR DONGER
[1:38:30] <wibbwobbler> must be so hard to come up with villains for flash, love gorrilla grodd tho
[1:38:30] <tearfuldevil> @StarkMaximum Fate, by a HUGE margin. Fate was 1940, Strange was 1963
[1:38:35] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts I though that was kinda funny.
[1:38:40] <zk_nails> shoulda picked Deadshot
[1:38:46] <StarkMaximum> @tearfuldevil Oh shit, that's a much bigger gap than I expected, thank you
[1:38:46] <+dream__center> Flash's rogue gallery isn't the best
[1:38:47] <ha2ken> That was both dumb and cool at the same time
[1:38:48] <MichaelOfCainhurst> more monke
[1:38:53] <+BlackMegaMan> Wow.......Neatherrealm really pumped out three whole fighting games this generation
[1:38:57] <+dream__center> outside of maybe prof zoom
[1:38:57] <DontChuckle98> *sees gorilla in game... HARAMBE!
[1:38:59] <gitdweezzy> reggie back down y
[1:39:02] <+dream__center> or captain culo
[1:39:02] <therealtacopancakes> Dr Fate possesses you and gives you one day a year of freedom to see your loved ones
[1:39:04] <+iamwood99> remember when gorilla grod went back in time and tried to kill a young obama
[1:39:10] <+evbites> hmmm monkey
[1:39:11] <anuchallengertwitch> Martian Manhunter is so strange in that he is potentially more Op than Superman, and yet in almost all media he's a jobber
[1:39:12] <%DensityD> I like the gif of Dr Fate with "I. DON'T. KNOW. ABOUT. THAT. ONE. CHIEF."
[1:39:15] <Dante_Namikaze1> Grod has the worst looking super in the game
[1:39:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 don't get me wrong it was. But one does question Nabu or whatever higher power looked at that guy and said "yep give him the mask"
[1:39:25] <+ZacharyWile> I feel like I've teleported years in the past with these Harambe jokes.
[1:39:27] <auso912> random chimp attack

[1:40:02] <raikagelord1> @anuchallengertwitch as much as I love Superman I don’t like how characters that can obviously up him are never allowed to.

[1:40:31] <anuchallengertwitch> @raikagelord1 something something marketing.
[1:40:37] <+dream__center> damn when woolie tries out heritage the ASB community probably gon get intimdated :p
[1:40:50] <%doomerskeletor13> I just realized when the next Planet of the Apes comes out there are gonna be a lot of “return to monke” memes about it

[1:41:36] <FrostedZaibatsu> Who is Woolie dressed as?
[1:41:36] <+evbites> @anuchallengertwitch i know but still it's a shame he's like the justice leagues manager
[1:41:40] <TreesDontTalk> Used to play this game all the time. Mained Swamp Thing. Wish they would have balanced him just a bit better. He has problems dealing with a lot of the cast once you start going up against killers. His stuff is very slow and unsafe.
[1:41:41] <%BisoromiBear> Blame every loss on the stutter.
[1:41:47] <ha2ken> We in here For Fun. But if someone gets blown up it's For Glory.
[1:41:48] <tearfuldevil> @FrostedZaibatsu eva unit 01???
[1:41:52] <TopTierHarley> are you using parsec? why?
[1:41:53] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 the most bizarre thing with Superman is taht characters that are obviously more powerful then him are not allowed to beat him. however Btaman can do it no problem cause something something he's batman something. It's always dumb
[1:42:18] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts I 100% agree and think that is stupid.
[1:42:18] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @treesdonttalk A lot of characters have problems dealing with the cast

[1:42:42] <anuchallengertwitch> @morcego_cinzento_arts not to mention wheever they fight Batman is most if not ALWAYS in the right. Give me an evil Batman for once that Superman beats
[1:42:45] <+evbites> Honestly superman is too busted they need to send him to a planet hulk scenario
[1:42:54] <StarkMaximum> @morcego_cinzento_arts I feel like Batman beating Superman is a power fantasy for most comic fans. A lot of people treat Batman as "the regular guy" superhero so if he can beat Superman, "anyone can". Even tho he's not, and they can't, but that's a different conversation.
[1:43:11] <+Story_Ark> Superman isnt really that busted if you actually use his villains
[1:43:14] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @evbites couldn't he just fly back
[1:43:19] <Aussie_Manny> not great
[1:43:23] <Aussie_Manny> not good for stream
[1:43:25] <TreesDontTalk> @unwoundcaesar70 True but he was especially bad. Some of his stuff was just not useable without eating damage. Although I would catch alot of people off guard who weren't used to the matchup
[1:43:25] <+gitgouda> yo that outfit is FIERCE
[1:43:36] <FrostedZaibatsu> I remember playing Cheetah in this game. Close range melee character... it didnt last long
[1:43:48] <+evbites> @UnwoundCaesar70 this is why pat hates superman
[1:43:56] <anuchallengertwitch> @StarkMaximum Injustice would've been marginally more interesting if Batman was the villain, not Superman
[1:43:57] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @treesdonttalk I get you I played a lot of cheetah so I understand the struggle
[1:44:09] <Aussie_Manny> SHOW HIM YOUR STRENGTH, CHAT
[1:44:14] <+Story_Ark> Pat hates superman cause other people like him and he loves to spite
[1:44:22] <StarkMaximum> @anuchallengertwitch I agree but I wouldn't be surprised if DC had some sort of contract that says Batman can't be evil or depicted in the wrong because he's too damn popular
[1:44:27] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @StarkMaximum i always thought it starned from Batman becoming much more popular and so people got an inferiority complex and he always hs to beat everybody
[1:44:30] <+evbites> just take away the yellow son and he's just a guy
[1:44:37] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @evbites the power of flight
[1:44:41] <StarkMaximum> @morcego_cinzento_arts Also valid
[1:44:42] <Aussie_Manny> Oh yeah, Cheetah's in the new movie.

[1:44:51] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus btw Cheetah has a Vixen alt, a short haired dark skin girl.
[1:44:54] <+dream__center> WW rogue galleries... ech
[1:45:03] <Lordkeyblade> the part of the trailer she's in I couldn't even see her
[1:45:06] <anuchallengertwitch> @StarkMaximum Batman can't be evil, but Superman, the most popular superhero EVER can?
[1:45:12] <%DensityD> woolieACCIDENT
[1:45:12] <BalloniWright> Muhammad Ali > Superman never forget
[1:45:12] <Aussie_Manny> Yep. Woolie gets it. Wonder Woman movie was great until that final fight.
[1:45:14] <%BudaBryan> yeah
[1:45:15] <powerprotoman> parsec is great woolie
[1:45:16] <%DensityD> oh no
[1:45:18] <TreesDontTalk> @unwoundcaesar70 I always hated how his vine grip would almost always get beat out by faster zone moves, making useless for full or mid screen and good for mid combo only.
[1:45:19] <MichaelOfCainhurst> I just remembered Robert Englund is Scarecrow in this...

[1:45:50] <%emperordread> "Works on my machine" Kappa
[1:45:51] <+dream__center> parsec ain't perfect
[1:45:54] <%DensityD> the show is called Get Into Fighting Games
[1:46:00] <+dream__center> but when it goes well it goes VERY well
[1:46:01] <StarkMaximum> @anuchallengertwitch Yes, because "what if Superman evil" is a story everyone is obsesesed with for some reason, because people see a character with god-like powers who can do whatever they want, and they find it unfathomable that anyone with thatl evel of power would do anything nice or positive
[1:46:11] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @treesdonttalk yeah IJ2 could have had a lot more life breathed into it if they gave it one more patch
[1:46:12] <tnamelessking> @woolieversus inj2 has a great netcode why use parsec???
[1:46:15] <TopTierHarley> ^
[1:46:20] <@Solidus_113> for people who don't own the game
[1:46:31] <+dream__center> well the problem is that IJ games are always to tide over NRS players until MK rolls in
[1:46:32] <%Koover> so people can drop in and play without having to get the game
[1:46:33] <TopTierHarley> just waste of time tbh
[1:46:34] <+Story_Ark> Evil Superman is so obnoxious. im done with it, i just want good Superman
[1:46:37] <+Tonku_the_Red> Wollie kinda looks like he has a lightsaber stabbed into his head.
[1:46:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> funny how in Injustice they went with the loin cloth and wraps for Cheetah for this ancient vibe. while most of the time she's either naked or with black sport clothing gear
[1:46:39] <StarkMaximum> OH YEAH I FORGOT YOU COULD DO THAT
[1:46:41] <+evbites> @StarkMaximum yes but it's so scary
[1:46:43] <+dream__center> which sorta leaves the IJ players stranded because some of them aren't MK players
[1:46:49] <Aussie_Manny> Without the game??!! Wow.
[1:46:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:46:52] <Jetsfantasy> At least those who don't have the PC ver
[1:47:03] <anuchallengertwitch> @thewoolieholeofdavidcage yes, I know about dark knights metal. but in those cases he still comes out on top over Superman, and Btaman has to beat him. I
[1:47:15] <tnamelessking> @woolieversus i had n idea u could do that
[1:47:19] <+dream__center> atrocitus eh

[1:48:03] <+evbites> look napalm bloodman
[1:48:03] <Afterman_> you cant
[1:48:03] <+dream__center> Red lanterns being the principal bad guys is a neat idea

[1:48:11] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan Good kitty
[1:48:15] <+Story_Ark> i think thats his backstory tho. or it might be his owner died.
[1:48:17] <ha2ken> Two big boys going at it yeyeye
[1:48:22] <+dream__center> but the rainbow spectrum deal... got pretty silly
[1:48:27] <Namillus> Yo DEX-STARR
[1:48:44] <Klownkommander> neat little note, atrocitus's voice also did Shao Kahn in MK11. also Javik in ME3
[1:48:49] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @StarkMaximum And cause the Batman fandom is the og definition of gatekeeping. it is inconceivable to them that an guy that has an screw loose due to tragedy at an earlier age. will ever become evil
[1:48:49] <StarkMaximum> Dex-Starr is a cat who got a red ring because of these punks that I think killed his owner and stuffed him in a sack and tried to throw him in the river
[1:48:50] <anuchallengertwitch> normalise more goofy shit like vengeful rage cats in comics
[1:48:53] <%DensityD> if the doom slayer was a feline
[1:48:53] <nopgnikatnight> Ouchies!
[1:48:54] <+evbites> @Story_Ark owner was a sweet old lady that got horribly murdered
[1:48:56] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @story_ark person killed his owner red lantern ring found him let him kill his owners killer
[1:49:11] <+Story_Ark> aah ok. wasnt sure if it was abandonment or owner dying
[1:49:20] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> @anuchallengertwitch doomsday batman had too bc its the dark earth. all worst outcomes happens. least super Lois lane killed batman before he could do anything lol
[1:49:23] <+dream__center> the blood puking of red lantern bearers is pretty metal
[1:49:25] <%DensityD> wiff wiff

[1:49:27] <Namillus> And then some punks threw him off a bridge

[1:50:18] <raikagelord1> @dream__center Boiling blood to be precise
[1:50:25] <TeepPhoenix> Thanks for the fight
[1:50:29] <+evbites> napalm blood

[1:50:44] <tearfuldevil> cant get ds4 to widnows to work
[1:50:47] <tearfuldevil> so i can't play
[1:50:48] <+evbites> that you vomit for days or hours
[1:50:50] <tearfuldevil> huzzah
[1:50:54] <StarkMaximum> @morcego_cinzento_arts The key with the red ring is that it comes to people at their lowest point desperate for some sort of vengeance or closure and it gives them the power to act on it, but the rage it fills them with is also pretty fucking painful to deal with, so it's a bit of a trade-off
[1:50:59] <Klownkommander> big f
[1:51:18] <raikagelord1> Being a red Lantern would be cool but also not.
[1:51:24] <StarkMaximum> If at any point you've been so mad that you genuinely wanted to kill someone, that's when a red ring would show up and offer itself to you
[1:51:27] <Aussie_Manny> POCKET SAND

[1:51:38] <+dream__center> aquamanssss

[1:52:21] <ha2ken> Hands behind the back tells you a lot about him
[1:52:21] <StarkMaximum> The problem with DC is that right now, comics are based ENTIRELY on the movies, adn the DC movies aren't great, so now everyone thinks DC sucks
[1:52:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so that's where the crazy superman people come from

[1:52:54] <Klownkommander> @starkmaximum would be great if WB could make a movie for shit
[1:52:55] <TeepPhoenix> Thanos was a striaight up rip off of Darkseid that grew into his own thing
[1:52:57] <raikagelord1> @doomerskeletor13 exactly
[1:52:58] <%DensityD> I like how dark sied beat thanos in the screw attack death battle
[1:53:02] <Parapattern> The comic where that guy kills Swamp Thing's father and Swamp Thing goes to Batman for help.
[1:53:03] <+dream__center> yeah DCAU is pretty buff

[1:53:53] <eldragon_1> The Blackest Night saga is my favorite DC thing. Wish they would adapt it into something.

[1:55:19] <TeepPhoenix> I'm playing with a PS4 controller tho
[1:55:21] <%Josef_Stryker> @Estuko Afaik everything on Apokolips is astronomically large so they sue Boom Tubes to scale their size down
[1:55:23] <+Rada150> what they should do to soft reset the movieverse is bring in Mr Myxsptlk
[1:55:25] <%Josef_Stryker> *use
[1:55:32] <+Rada150> and he can just fix it
[1:55:32] <%koolaid_kevster> aww i wanna play sad face
[1:55:33] <raikagelord1> Wish Red Hood was cooler in this Game.
[1:55:34] <+RenoDeGeneric> A LOT of people played Atrocitus
[1:55:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Darkseid and the New Gods are all super rad but very few people besides Jack Kirby have ever done them well
[1:55:38] <SerRule1> Remember when Darkseid was reborn as a a businesssman gangster?
[1:55:41] <+Estuko> @Josef_Stryker right I was trying to remember how specifically but the boom tubes
[1:55:45] <+meowarco> Dex Starr brucegYell
[1:55:46] <+Story_Ark> i genuinely think the Flash movie will reset the movie universe
[1:55:47] <wendigo172> @tonku_the_red that’s just how Jack Kirby wrote comics lol
[1:55:53] <tnamelessking> @woolieversus im not sure im play red hood and robin
[1:56:02] <%doomerskeletor13> @story_ark That’s what all the leaks and stuff are saying
[1:56:04] <raikagelord1> @serrule1 didn’t Batman shoot him in that Form?
[1:56:04] <Aussie_Manny> Terrible lines. omg
[1:56:06] <%Josef_Stryker> Atrocitus shouldn't have lips.
[1:56:07] <%DensityD> MEOW
[1:56:08] <DerpioParty> Cat advantage
[1:56:10] <Aussie_Manny> EVIL CAT D:
[1:56:12] <%DensityD> lmao
[1:56:15] <%democrazyyy> my favorite darkseid thing is the greentext where he breaks into a dudes apartment and steals the last slice of cake while the dude is pissing himself in fear
[1:56:21] <Aussie_Manny> Is Atrocitus Paige????
[1:56:23] <%emperordread> I swear I heard them saw "cum" instead of "karma" and that drastically changed the context
[1:56:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Dex-Starr is a good cat
[1:56:23] <+Estuko> Isn't he supposed to be smooth and have some angry ass teeth
[1:56:25] <+evbites> @Rada150 and have batmite whine about not getting his fix of batman
[1:56:25] <+Story_Ark> @doomerskeletor13 ooh i didnt know there were leaks. all i heard was bringing back affleck and keaton.
[1:56:31] <StarkMaximum> You know Frame Advantage? Atrocitus has Cat Advantage
[1:56:32] <%Josef_Stryker> He should have like a Barraka-esque mouth
[1:56:36] <%democrazyyy> drinks the milk straight from the bottle, because hes evil
[1:56:38] <+RenoDeGeneric> @WoolieVersus You can apparently hold up during the vine grab for an air version
[1:56:39] <SerRule1> @raikagelord1 He did! It was awesome! Shot him with a god-killing bullet that sent Batman through time.
[1:56:44] <%DensityD> what happens to your blood when you put on the red lantern ring?
[1:56:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Robert Pattinson will have his own little Batman universe
[1:56:49] <+Estuko> @democrazyyy doesn't wash his hands, because he's eeevill
[1:56:51] <TalisKanju> Atrccitus is Paige and Dex-Starr is Pat
[1:56:55] <TeepPhoenix> My favorite Darkseid thing is that he will just going into anyone's house that he doesn't like, and will go in and sit on their couch
[1:56:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 he needed an Under The Red Hood animation directing. At least is not Arkham Knight shit
[1:57:11] <+Rada150> so supposedly the meme blue lantern corgi is cannon according to a writer
[1:57:12] <StarkMaximum> @DensityD I'm pretty sure it becomes basically lava, and it's constantly burning you from the inside. That's why they spit it out to use it as a weapon
[1:57:15] <+Tonku_the_Red> @wendigo172 Yeah. It's just tonally distorting when these big bad all powerful godlike characters are written like that.
[1:57:18] <+evbites> @DensityD it becomes napalm and explodes out of you
[1:57:19] <AllTheZibas> Puked on
[1:57:19] <@Solidus_113> spicy
[1:57:20] <+Story_Ark> @serrule1 then we got Battle for the Cowl as well as Bruce becoming caveman Batman, cowboy Batman, and pirate Batman
[1:57:22] <%democrazyyy> its like thanos fucking with that one dude on his birthday every year for his entire life, just for kicks
[1:57:22] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts fair and I agree
[1:57:24] <Aussie_Manny> toasty~!
[1:57:25] <eldragon_1> @DensityD it gets replaced by the red lantern energy
[1:57:34] <%democrazyyy> something about people being evil just because they love it is so fun
[1:57:42] <AllTheZibas> Angry kitty
[1:57:42] <%doomerskeletor13> @teepphoenix Yep. He’s not a smashy fighting guy, he’s diabolical evil
[1:57:46] <%Josef_Stryker> Dex-Starr has the saddest fucking backstory
[1:57:50] <SerRule1> @Story_Ark Don't forget Witch Hunter pilgrim Batman where he got blessed AND cursed at the same time.
[1:58:06] <cgame_me811> @democrazyyy Yeah
[1:58:07] <+Estuko> @democrazyyy it's also a line used in JLU LUL "Aren't you gonna wash your hands..?" "Noo... Cuz I'm evil.."
[1:58:09] <%SirGO0SE> woolieKICKDAD
[1:58:11] <%DensityD> Dex-Starr of Earth. You have great anger in your heart.
[1:58:13] <Aussie_Manny> yeah the boyyys
[1:58:13] <+evbites> @democrazyyy not even for kicks just because he can
[1:58:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also it now hits me. i think that the VA for Atrocidus is the same for Shao Kahn in MK11
[1:58:20] <+Rada150> has anyone seen the Gold Lantern corps pick Bendis tried to put into dc
[1:58:22] <+Story_Ark> man that story was great. one of my go to stories to show people who dont read comics
[1:58:22] <%DensityD> psaGib
[1:58:22] <%Bail_seven> GG
[1:58:24] <TeepPhoenix> Yes, he has the sam eVA
[1:58:28] <Klownkommander> @morcego_cinzento_arts it is
[1:58:31] <cgame_me811> Silverhand Silverhand
[1:58:31] <@Menitta> They doing parsec
[1:58:32] <@Menitta> ?
[1:58:36] <TeepPhoenix> It was really distracting when I started MK11
[1:58:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes
[1:58:41] <%DensityD> correct, they are doing parsec
[1:58:43] <raikagelord1> @menitta yes
[1:58:45] <Dante_Namikaze1> @morcego_cinzento_arts oh wow I didn't notice that
[1:58:47] <cgame_me811> Yeah
[1:58:52] <@Menitta> Sick I gotta figure out how this works
[1:58:53] <eldragon_1> My favorite was: "Lex Luthor of Earth, YOU WANT IT ALL."
[1:58:53] <TeepPhoenix> I preferred his MK9 voice
[1:58:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Klownkommander now i know i'm not crazy. thanks
[1:58:59] <Aussie_Manny> Stephen Amell.
[1:59:01] <%DensityD> TURTLE POWER
[1:59:06] <SerRule1> Did you know: In the main DC universe, Poison Ivy has never murdered anyone, (except for pervert assholes later on).
[1:59:07] <+meowarco> Green arrow was my favorite
[1:59:25] <raikagelord1> Remember the Royal Flush gang in Batman beyond?
[1:59:26] <TeepPhoenix> Green Arrow is a dork in this game, he's funny
[1:59:27] <%Josef_Stryker> I wonder who they could add in Injustice 3
[1:59:29] <cgame_me811> @morcego_cinzento_arts Is it?
[1:59:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Green Arrow is cool
[1:59:45] <StarkMaximum> @eldragon_1 Lex was a special case because there's usuallly only ever one Orange Lantern in existence at one time - because orange is avarice/greed, and none of them would ever want to share the power.
[1:59:45] <+Story_Ark> yeah Oliver is better as a dork
[1:59:58] <@Menitta> this fucking match
[2:00:00] <+Estuko> I love Green Arrow lol, he was also a favorite in Justice League Unlimited
[2:00:06] <raikagelord1> @josef_stryker they have options but a lot of people are dead so idk.
[2:00:12] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 i do. Terry got the hots for the daughter(and there is an slight implication they might had slept together)
[2:00:14] <+dream__center> its witty Oliver
[2:00:15] <%democrazyyy> he's a skin in the first game
[2:00:22] <wibbwobbler> lucky bastard is with black canary
[2:00:23] <+dream__center> oh CW and DC shows
[2:00:25] <Aussie_Manny> CW shows are weird.
[2:00:27] <+Story_Ark> Fuck CW Arrow. Oliver is supposed to be witty fun and dorky
[2:00:28] <BreakersAweigh> i love the witty goofball oliver much more
[2:00:29] <eldragon_1> @StarkMaximum yeah I know. He only had it for a little bit. But it was the raddest thing ever.
[2:00:29] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts exactly
[2:00:33] <+Tonku_the_Red> This Arrow doesn't spend copious amounts of screentime doing the salmon ladder shirtless.
[2:00:34] <Aussie_Manny> Doom Patrol's very good though.
[2:00:35] <stranger59> Everytime Woolie mentions Green Arrow, it's about his abs.
[2:00:36] <%Josef_Stryker> @raikagelord1 They could always clean slate it or use alternate universe versions.
[2:00:36] <%doomerskeletor13> Bleeding heart liberal Green Arrow
[2:00:37] <SerRule1> In the War of Jokes and Riddles, Deadshot and Deathstroke are real dicks.
[2:00:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @cgame_me811 about the VA? yeah somebody in chat confirmed to me
[2:00:38] <dinnydanny777> Smallville was alright
[2:00:39] <+dream__center> true it appeals
[2:00:40] <+meowarco> No, but there was a CW Skin in the first game I think
[2:00:43] <anuchallengertwitch> And NOW, they're trying to do it to the Powerpuff girls
[2:00:47] <+dream__center> like that supergirl on CBS
[2:00:51] <TeepPhoenix> Green Lantern calls Ollie an SJW in this.
[2:00:53] <wendigo172> CW turned Ollie into Batman and ruined everything good about him
[2:00:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:55] <@Menitta> I watched a bunch of Supergirl on netflix. that show sucks
[2:00:55] <+Story_Ark> CW Arrow is just Batman
[2:00:59] <Dante_Namikaze1> Smallville was good
[2:01:01] <+dream__center> whose that SuperGIRL on CBS awhile back apparently did well enough
[2:01:03] <%DensityD> abs is my fetish
[2:01:03] <%doomerskeletor13> @teepphoenix That tracks
[2:01:10] <+evbites> CW MAKE THEM HOT AND ANGSTY
[2:01:11] <fernandapsdois> cw flash is fine
[2:01:12] <Aussie_Manny> Batwoman?
[2:01:13] <dinnydanny777> I thought Supergirl was okay
[2:01:13] <stranger59> @anuchallengertwitch Are you saying the Powerpuff Girls will have abs?
[2:01:16] <cgame_me811> @morcego_cinzento_arts Oh nice doodGood
[2:01:16] <+Rada150> why can't we get Guy Gardner, Kyle Raynor, Simon Baz and Jessica cruz green lantern skins why just hal and john
[2:01:17] <TeepPhoenix> I figured it out, Green Arrow is Johnny Cage for Injustice
[2:01:18] <the38bandit> Steven Amell wrestled that one time on All Out, that was cool
[2:01:19] <+dream__center> haha hbirds of prey back then
[2:01:20] <+Story_Ark> Gotham wasnt CW
[2:01:21] <StarkMaximum> Hit 'em with the bow, Ollie
[2:01:22] <PushBaiken4SummerSlam> TITANS
[2:01:25] <raikagelord1> @josef_stryker you right and I would wanna See Bronze Tiger or like Wild Cat. Actual fighters.
[2:01:26] <%democrazyyy> they're making a fucking Powerpuff girls show
[2:01:26] <BreakersAweigh> i think they have a black lightning show?
[2:01:27] <+dream__center> batman and catwoman had a child :p
[2:01:27] <@Menitta> the first season was fine. The 2nd was soooo bad
[2:01:31] <+Story_Ark> ???
[2:01:39] <%democrazyyy> when they're old and jaded from a childhood of fighting crime
[2:01:40] <stranger59> CW rescued Supergirl from ABC's absurdity.
[2:01:40] <%NeedlesD> Batwoman
[2:01:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Batwoman finally got a show and it sucked :( she deserves better
[2:01:43] <+Tonku_the_Red> Batwoman
[2:01:45] <BreakersAweigh> batwoman
[2:01:45] <Aussie_Manny> RWBY.
[2:01:47] <wibbwobbler> supergirl got transferred to cw lol
[2:01:50] <KingOfAces> GG
[2:01:50] <+evbites> @dream__center huntress?
[2:01:51] <+dream__center> oh yeah Batwoman
[2:01:52] <%Josef_Stryker> Batwoman
[2:01:52] <raikagelord1> The first season of Arrow and Flash where good in my opinion.
[2:01:52] <%SirGO0SE> shes so fucking hot
[2:01:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Dante_Namikaze1
[2:01:53] <SerRule1> Batwoman the show does not do the comics justice.
[2:01:54] <%Tearonex> Batwoman
[2:01:54] <%Josef_Stryker> Ruby Rose
[2:01:55] <%DensityD> needs more stage transitions
[2:01:57] <TeepPhoenix> She's the deaf girl in John Wick
[2:01:57] <cgame_me811> @teepphoenix Don’t remember that
[2:01:59] <+Story_Ark> Supergirl moved to CW
[2:02:01] <anuchallengertwitch> @stranger59 I don't even know anymore. CW plans on making an adult oriented powerpuff girls that tackles how they feel they wasted their childhood fighting crime
[2:02:03] <%DensityD> break the walls
[2:02:04] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:02:09] <+dream__center> @evbites yeah CW BoP version
[2:02:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Hot abs with hot abs? that is basic comic hero romance 101. with luck tehy don't end up breaking up in them ost dumb way possible or become an abusive couple
[2:02:13] <stranger59> Batwoman came to find why Bruce Wayne is missing... now new Batwoman is here to find why Batwoman is missing.
[2:02:16] <Dante_Namikaze1> Supergirl was on CBS and then the CW took it
[2:02:18] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[2:02:23] <raikagelord1> LUL
[2:02:24] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL

[2:02:29] <Dante_Namikaze1> LUL
[2:02:30] <cgame_me811> Woolie please LUL
[2:02:33] <SerRule1> There's a sense of detective noir in the Batwoman comics. The show doesn't have that.
[2:02:33] <%emperordread> This will be the bait that we waited for
[2:02:36] <@Menitta> How do I join on parsec
[2:02:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Love you Reggie
[2:02:39] <+Story_Ark> Supergirl wasnt on ABC iirc
[2:02:40] <dinnydanny777> Doesn't Ruby Rose have abs too?
[2:02:45] <MyFavoritePants> LUL
[2:02:48] <stranger59> @anuchallengertwitch It'll probably be more Riverdale than anything else.
[2:02:55] <Utzma> Utzma subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:03:19] <%doomerskeletor13> As a big comic nerd this is hitting all the right buttons
[2:03:20] <dinnydanny777> @stranger59 I hope it's like Riverdale, Riverdale is so bad it's hilarious, it's like the Room
[2:03:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Jaime!
[2:03:25] <SerRule1> Lost me job today so talkin DC is helping me forget that a little.
[2:03:27] <+Story_Ark> I thought CW Flash wasnt too bad for a while
[2:03:34] <cgame_me811> Of course LUL LUL LUL
[2:03:35] <raikagelord1> Can we all Agree Batman: The brave and the bold was great and Muisc Meister is a great character
[2:03:41] <velvetroomalex> yo reppin my boi Blue Beetle
[2:03:43] <%doomerskeletor13> @serrule1 Sorry man
[2:03:47] <anuchallengertwitch> @raikage yup
[2:03:49] <+evbites> Batwoman show was made to hit the box and nothing else hell they fucked over their leading lady
[2:03:52] <raikagelord1> @story_ark I agree
[2:03:52] <wibbwobbler> THE FUTURE IS SO COOL
[2:03:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Blue Beetle 3
[2:03:58] <stranger59> @dinnydanny777 Yeah, if a show is just completely insane, people will have to watch it.
[2:03:59] <+Story_Ark> Yeah, this is why I wish i liked IJ2 more. i love the characters
[2:03:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> eh not gonna give Reggie much shit over not knowing comics. for all the questionable reggie things, not being up with comics is not one of them...speically since most stuff had been trash for years
[2:04:06] <+Story_Ark> MAAAN THAT EXCHANGE IS GREAT
[2:04:15] <%NeedlesD> Blue and Gold are great
[2:04:15] <cgame_me811> @serrule1 Sorry to hear doodSad
[2:04:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Brave and the Bold is super underrated
[2:04:18] <Aussie_Manny> Young Justice was great.
[2:04:19] <SerRule1> @doomerskeletor13 It's okay. Sad but I got a pretty good severance from it and 5 years of experience now to help move on.
[2:04:21] <+Story_Ark> DC has looots of great B listers
[2:04:31] <raikagelord1> Blue Beetle is basically Iron man with a little bit of Venom.
[2:04:34] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah that was Ted Kord Blue Beetle
[2:04:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @SerRule1 sorry to hear about it. hope you get an new one soon
[2:04:37] <+evbites> booster gold is future scumbag who deals with all the time travel shit
[2:04:45] <Aussie_Manny> @WoolieVersus Reggie should watch Young Justice.

[2:05:22] <+Estuko> I'm shocked so many people were mad about the Ninja Turtles were here instead, they're so fun lol
[2:05:23] <+Story_Ark> MAN, I hate that I cant get the feel of IJ2. TMNT look amazing
[2:05:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @anuchallengertwitch that PPg thing sounds like an fanfic idea that was never ever meant to be made official

[2:05:41] <%doomerskeletor13> The first Blue Beetle was Dan Garret, then Ted Kord, then Jaime Reyes
[2:05:42] <%democrazyyy> nooooo
[2:05:43] <SerRule1> @raikagelord1 the fat Blue Beetle?

[2:06:00] <DerpioParty> All that wasted pizza
[2:06:00] <%BisoromiBear> atpIzza
[2:06:00] <@Menitta> that is such a waste lmao
[2:06:07] <@Solidus_113> https://parsec.gg/g/1fF6Rc9CAwlFtOLFTtMsAAx5qli/ab174168/
[2:06:10] <raikagelord1> Young Justice is great but am Worried it’s future.
[2:06:14] <+evbites> that ending is wrong
[2:06:15] <+Tonku_the_Red> Eats one piece then throws the pizza away. Even if it has mushrooms on it, it's still a waste.
[2:06:17] <%huskarl_zap> that was a fatality
[2:06:21] <anuchallengertwitch> Tmnt is violent when it wants to be
[2:06:23] <+Story_Ark> how was the recent YJ season?
[2:06:30] <%doomerskeletor13> It was fine
[2:06:34] <DerpioParty> Since there's no fatalities, is there a point for characters getting up after they get beat?
[2:06:39] <+Story_Ark> Also the Batman vs tmnt crossover had some blood and violence
[2:06:39] <morcego_cinzento_arts> here an shitty opinion of mine: Terry McGinnis is an better batman then Bruce Wayne. there i said it
[2:06:43] <cgame_me811> Hawaiian pizza <3
[2:06:43] <wendigo172> @story_ark bloated but still good
[2:06:47] <BreakersAweigh> the young justice cartoon was rad and i haven't watched the 3rd season. i heard it was ok?
[2:07:02] <+evbites> @morcego_cinzento_arts is that not correct
[2:07:02] <%Juckold_Cones> have you DONE any cool things TODAY?
[2:07:15] <%Malik1002> @WoolieVersus ggs this is rapping paper swear to god just got done playing fighters and have been holding back to block
[2:07:17] <%democrazyyy> this is a cool scarecrow but the arkham knight version is the best
[2:07:18] <%doomerskeletor13> It was fine. They didn’t have as much budget and they were getting back into the swing of it, Season 4 sounds better
[2:07:19] <%Juckold_Cones> love the FIGHTS MAN its so cooool
[2:07:19] <anuchallengertwitch> 1987 goofy turtles was a big departure from the original source material
[2:07:19] <%Solidnick18> i used to play bane abit

[2:07:31] <+Story_Ark> *wrestler
[2:07:34] <TeepPhoenix> Yeah, this is Freddy Krueger as scarecrow!
[2:07:35] <raikagelord1> @story_ark it was pretty good just feel like they could pander to much and they used a character who could revive as a Bloody Punching bag
[2:07:35] <%Josef_Stryker> Fun Fact: Scarecrow is voiced by Robert Englund aka Freddy Krueger
[2:07:39] <TopTierHarley> Robert Englund btw
[2:07:44] <wibbwobbler> bane is a tactical genius raised in a prison
[2:07:44] <dinnydanny777> Well that's not the Scarecrow from the movie lol
[2:07:44] <%Solidnick18> the fear toxin
[2:07:45] <SerRule1> Fun Fact: Bane once beat up all of Gotham's villains by himself.
[2:07:48] <+CryptusMaximus> Freddy Kreuger hyper
[2:07:49] <@Menitta> that looks like a goddamn El Fuerte tackle
[2:07:51] <+dream__center> yeah thats how scarecrows gimmick works in this game
[2:07:52] <+CryptusMaximus> *hype
[2:08:00] <%Solidnick18> bane yeeeee

[2:08:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 Young Justice is like filled with thousand small neat things but one messy main plot. specially with each season is the same "keeping your firends in the dark to protect them will make things worst" but on an much bigger scale each time.....even if seeing Black Lighting chew everybody's asses is fun
[2:08:17] <Shardlab> Suplex City
[2:08:23] <raikagelord1> Bane is sick and probably my favorite Batman Villan.
[2:08:35] <TeepPhoenix> Bane once let all the villains loose in Gotham to get Batman tired before he snuck into the Batcave and broke Batman's back
[2:08:36] <SerRule1> For real, the only reason Bane loses to Batman is because of the venom. Sober Bane is the deadliest Bane.
[2:08:37] <tearfuldevil> @morcego_cinzento_arts oh no that sounds guaranteed to piss me off

[2:08:56] <+Story_Ark> Bane in the comics is SO different than the movie and its disappointing. in the comics hes a hispanic luchador who basically is reverse bruce, being raised in a prison and training to take vengeance and using his genius
[2:08:57] <raikagelord1> @morcego_cinzento_arts I agree
[2:08:57] <alephalpha> raistlin majere?
[2:08:58] <+Jazzcrasher> The CHUNK
[2:08:59] <%doomerskeletor13> I was so disappointed when TDKR made Bane into some weird sounding white dude

[2:11:39] <%doomerskeletor13> They had a stupid mandate after Crisis that Superman could be the only Kryptonian, so they had to make Supergirl into a weird shapeshifter
[2:11:39] <stranger59> GET WET
[2:11:39] <cipher758> her origin was all over the place
[2:11:39] <SerRule1> I've been reading Aquaman since new 52 started. Aquaman was one of the best things coming out of that.
[2:11:40] <+dream__center> that STRING tho
[2:11:42] <TeepPhoenix> So Aquaman is Cardi B?
[2:11:43] <CazadorDeWulf> Why is she even called Supergirl if we're trying to empower the image of women? Why not Superwoman?
[2:11:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @raikagelord1 oh okay
[2:11:47] <+dream__center> that stab string used to be mad stupid

[2:24:08] <+Story_Ark> Batman vs TMNT was so good
[2:24:17] <+Story_Ark> "this is where my parents were killed, raphael"
[2:24:17] <@Menitta> "This is where my parents died"
[2:24:21] <CazadorDeWulf> LUL

[2:24:50] <%doomerskeletor13> He has actually met the Ninja turtles, a couple times actually
[2:24:54] <CazadorDeWulf> I was just joking tbh I had no idea there was a TMNT Batman crossover LUL
[2:25:00] <chll0ne> yeah the movie was good actually
[2:25:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Batman vs TMNT added Batman lore. Apparently he folds his pizza slice like an New Yorker
[2:25:08] <heartlesshealer> REGGIE HOW
[2:25:11] <+Story_Ark> yeah the comic and movie were both super good
[2:25:13] <CazadorDeWulf> What, did you even watch TMNT
[2:25:15] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie plz
[2:25:17] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s been like 4 Batman TMNT crossovers
[2:25:18] <+Rada150> gotham is cannonically in new jersey

[2:25:22] <cipher758> Reggie knows stuff

[2:25:30] <Dante_Namikaze1> Reggie have missed literally everything
[2:25:30] <CazadorDeWulf> Dropping a turtle on its back, like that would do shit
[2:25:32] <dinnydanny777> I thought turtles had 4 fingers
[2:25:32] <+jiggy_snipe> 2 would be a puppet hand Kappa

[2:49:17] <cipher758> low bar
[2:49:20] <Tryhardblackguy> @Estuko lol I didnt know that was a tweet, I think I did post something like that when Slasher posted the trailer
[2:49:29] <CazadorDeWulf> Roy can't handle the recoil
[2:49:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is Roy the Striker of Punch Planet?

[2:51:45] <PP_Willpower> hk is the right trigger
[2:51:54] <CazadorDeWulf> Buying Marvel skins in Fortnite is the ultimate advertisement and YOU have to pay for it LUL
[2:51:55] <Strtfghtr88> they just patched the game
[2:51:57] <deafmelone> @tryhardblackguy gotta STEAL them and mod them into MAHVEL
[2:52:08] <Tryhardblackguy> I just hope with Fortnite it gives me hope they can make a fighter with mutants and Fantastic 4 characters now
[2:52:13] <FacetiousAF> dang it bobby, 1.0 is official launch you had me confused
[2:52:48] <Tryhardblackguy> @deafmelone they will probably looks like doodoo in the MvC:i engine, the lack of post-processing makes the game look even worst.

[3:14:48] <krakendeals> hi
[3:14:52] <%Koover> gotcha, thanks ye
[3:15:03] <Strtfghtr88> you dont even need to own the game to play on parsec
[3:15:06] <MonsieurHonHon> I mean it looks fun to play with woolie but ive barely played this game, if I get in ill get absolutely bodied
[3:15:14] <heartlesshealer> !
[3:15:25] <%ChoculaUltra> getting bodied is the first step to bodying others!
[3:15:36] <%Koover> ye just play and enjoy yourself
[3:15:37] <Strtfghtr88> MonsieurHonHon win or lose, its fun cause of instant replay
[3:15:41] <%ChoculaUltra> but yeah, I wouldn't wanna step in the ring with Woolie and Reg who've been labbing all night LUL
[3:15:46] <MonsieurHonHon> Alright then, lets get bodied

[3:16:30] <@Menitta> GG
[3:16:34] <+xerotwo> GG
[3:16:40] <@Menitta> That game is really fun
[3:16:40] <MonsieurHonHon> Also why is woolie in Eva(?) costume?
[3:16:42] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm under the assumption there has to be SOME eldritch magic involved in Parsec somehow.
[3:16:59] <@Menitta> It was honestly really responsive and looked good
[3:17:03] <Strtfghtr88> swifti10Ameno
[3:17:08] <kasios> omg different outfits?

[3:21:02] <PP_Willpower> that was always one of the big reason for the double tap
[3:21:04] <Strtfghtr88> that black and grey looks sick
[3:21:11] <PP_Willpower> cuz people who don't know will still get it
[3:21:16] <Strtfghtr88> double tap lets you cover up your mistakes too
[3:21:20] <+cocoapupstudios> thick thighs taking lives
[3:21:34] <BackwardCap> Everyone been playing this today.
[3:21:39] <PP_Willpower> cr.hk is good for agent

[3:23:04] <PunchPlanetGame> swifti10Ameno swifti10Ameno swifti10Ameno
[3:23:14] <MonsieurHonHon> Honestly it didnt feel like I had NAY lag
[3:23:19] <+RowenCleric> yooo Cid looks sick too
[3:23:20] <%ChoculaUltra> can we buy Reggie an Sachiel or other Angel onesie so he can match with Woolie
[3:23:21] <Strtfghtr88> wont see any teleporting
[3:23:23] <@Menitta> w h a t k i n d o f c r i m i n a l r u
[3:23:24] <+Estuko> @SLVRBAKSLPZ As I said before, 2 whole paychecks to have her perform that fatal move on me.
[3:23:26] <MonsieurHonHon> this is wild. It helps probab;y that im in Montreal too
[3:23:28] <kasios> parsec is a treasure
[3:23:32] <%Koover> yeah felt fine to me
[3:23:51] <+RowenCleric> the Marvel 3 parsec resurgence is so beautiful
[3:23:52] <Strtfghtr88> dont be mistaken, this game has amazing netcode
[3:23:59] <@Menitta> Its also a fantastic way to introduce someone into a game without having to buy a copy
[3:24:02] <Strtfghtr88> GGPO
[3:24:19] <MonsieurHonHon> I had a blast playing, I will defo requeu later
[3:24:21] <PP_Willpower> yeah seeing parsec used like this is pretty cool
[3:24:26] <PP_Willpower> really easy to get viewers in matches with you
[3:24:36] <Strtfghtr88> parsec is definitely viable
[3:24:44] <cipher758> great idea all around
[3:24:47] <+dewottm8> Ayyyyy woolie!!!!!
[3:24:53] <MonsieurHonHon> had a scare at the start becuase it took a while for my controller to register
[3:25:02] <%ChoculaUltra> its breathing new life into older games that have awful netcode
[3:25:40] <@Menitta> I'm imagining using Parsec with something like Mario Party
[3:25:45] <Strtfghtr88> the taunt PogChamp
[3:25:46] <PP_Willpower> yooooo
[3:25:48] <kasios> YOOO
[3:25:50] <Strtfghtr88> CID!!!!!!!!!
[3:25:53] <%Koover> I'd really like to lean how people pick apart games and put their own netcode into them
[3:25:54] <+RowenCleric> he got in Reggies head!
[3:25:55] <%ChoculaUltra> get knifed
[3:25:57] <Picosunloaded> nice

[3:26:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> mentally
[3:26:54] <Strtfghtr88> ^
[3:27:02] <%ChoculaUltra> taunts are the mental raw level 3
[3:27:04] <MonsieurHonHon> Core-A told us taunts and bm matter
[3:27:09] <+dewottm8> @woolieversus can you do a wakka voice
[3:27:10] <MonsieurHonHon> and so they do
[3:27:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> taunts midscreen after you've bodied them to all but 1 pixel does so much
[3:27:39] <~WoolieVersus> https://parsec.gg/g/1fF6Rc9CAwlFtOLFTtMsAAx5qli/ab174168/

[3:28:47] <+dewottm8> I don’t have sthis game
[3:28:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause i still feel that robbery of whiffing my super
[3:28:57] <LoneFonte> @dewottm8
[3:29:07] <Strtfghtr88> dewottm8 are parsec you just play a stream of the game
[3:29:08] <LoneFonte> just download parsec
[3:29:11] <%Koover> I didn't wanna go twice if someone who hadn't played wanted to go
[3:29:13] <%Rosewater_444> I DONt HAVE a CONTROLLER
[3:29:16] <%SirGO0SE> i keep getting timed out message
[3:29:20] <%SirGO0SE> idk how to fix it
[3:29:22] <Strtfghtr88> @Rosewater_444 keyboard boi
[3:29:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus some if not most might use wifi/laptop, i do which is why i can't do parsec sadly
[3:29:36] <MonsieurHonHon> theres no queue, you just ogtta try when the game end and the other player quits
[3:29:42] <%Struggleful> I don't play fighting games I just pretend that i do
[3:29:46] <MonsieurHonHon> ^
[3:29:56] <Strtfghtr88> ^
[3:29:58] <+dewottm8> I’m gonna be honest here I have no idea what this game is
[3:30:10] <%Rosewater_444> @Strtfghtr88 only KB, no mouse. best setup
[3:30:12] <PP_Willpower> punchu planeto
[3:30:13] <MonsieurHonHon> Ive recently started fantasy strike and stuff but I dont play too much.
[3:30:22] <%SirGO0SE> i just wanna get my ass kicked :(
[3:30:22] <+Sleepyboi86> who is the grappler on this?
[3:30:27] <%DensityD> fighting games addre back
[3:30:31] <PP_Willpower> tyara here is the grappler
[3:30:31] <MonsieurHonHon> Tyara is supposed to be the grappler
[3:30:40] <BoneBagMel> BALLSY
[3:30:47] <Strtfghtr88> Its Sci-fi and punching
[3:30:48] <+Sleepyboi86> never seen this but like the aesthetic
[3:30:54] <%Rosewater_444> the rushdown
[3:30:56] <BoneBagMel> This game looks pretty legit
[3:31:05] <BoneBagMel> really like the western cartoon aesthetic
[3:31:13] <Strtfghtr88> The most Cyberpunk fighting game you'll ever see
[3:31:14] <%DensityD> tyara it's the giant woman
[3:31:21] <MonsieurHonHon> The animation cancel mechanic is way too high level for me,
[3:31:34] <BoneBagMel> is this game 3 4 or 6 button?
[3:31:38] <+dewottm8> Ok brb
[3:31:38] <Strtfghtr88> 6
[3:31:45] <%DensityD> all I wanna do is see you turn into
[3:31:47] <MonsieurHonHon> Like I understand on paper that it allows for deeper and better combos but like once the controller is in my hand all that flys out the window
[3:31:53] <BoneBagMel> yoooo L.-M-H ?
[3:31:59] <Strtfghtr88> two lights, two mediums, two heavies
[3:32:00] <%ha2ken> She's a tough woman with a nice strut
[3:32:05] <BoneBagMel> oh shit niiice
[3:32:07] <BoneBagMel> I think I might get it
[3:32:09] <Strtfghtr88> @BoneBagMel yeah its a throwback
[3:32:15] <Strtfghtr88> Feels good on a stick
[3:32:33] <BoneBagMel> I play on keyboard, WASD to move YUI for punches HJK for kicks
[3:32:40] <BoneBagMel> works pretty well on KI
[3:32:47] <Strtfghtr88> two lights for throw, two mediums for parry/overhead, two heavies for taunt
[3:32:59] <Strtfghtr88> it will work on here too
[3:33:01] <BoneBagMel> perfect, I can translate KI to that pretty well
[3:33:14] <BoneBagMel> how flexible are combos?
[3:33:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1297990589783441409?s=20
[3:33:17] <Strtfghtr88> i think you need joy 2 key to reprogram keys tho
[3:33:20] <MonsieurHonHon> I played a lot of MVC when I was in elementary school on a MAME emu, the controls were wasd and l;',./
[3:33:21] <%DensityD> @strtfghtr88 can I quote you on that?
[3:33:21] <+goose_attack_almanac> GIANT WOMAN
[3:33:26] <%Koover> are supers double motions or single motion and two buttons
[3:33:33] <Strtfghtr88> BoneBagMel about as flexible as SF4
[3:33:34] <MonsieurHonHon> I didnt know how to change them lmao
[3:33:45] <Strtfghtr88> Koover double motion, 2 buttons
[3:33:49] <BoneBagMel> :/ I wasn't too good on SF4... still might try it tho
[3:33:49] <+dewottm8> K I’m back
[3:33:53] <MonsieurHonHon> oof
[3:33:56] <Strtfghtr88> one button koover my bad
