[0:06:37] <brachydios777> That game looks hard as shit
[0:06:46] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:06:55] <+Jiggisnipe> oh the ps4 version is ass
[0:06:58] <BlackermanZX> so the ps version is botched
[0:06:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:05] <+Ryaotz> that is a shame
[0:07:06] <T_Sasquatch> hmmmm
[0:07:07] <+styptysat> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:07:08] <brachydios777> What?
[0:07:11] <aiutare47> Damn
[0:07:13] <@Menitta> That's odd
[0:07:13] <leith_aziz> Ps4 version is bad ? Thats the opposite
[0:07:13] <@Solidus_113> what a twist
[0:07:13] <Blank9> woolie cursed to glitches forever
[0:07:15] <andre11dr> So it's only on ps?
[0:07:18] <dds333a> Guess so
[0:07:19] <@Menitta> I beat it on PS4 no problem
[0:07:23] <DatAsuna> PS5 bad?
[0:07:23] <leith_aziz> PC MASTER RACE
[0:07:26] <T_Sasquatch> gas lighted by a video game LUL
[0:07:26] <+Hasmeister96> what is Woolie talking about?
[0:07:27] <%dirkfunk1> which game? i missed it
[0:07:27] <leith_aziz> RISE UP
[0:07:30] <DatAsuna> or ps4
[0:07:35] <brachydios777> Is this game on Xbox?
[0:07:36] <dds333a> Ghostrunner
[0:07:42] <aiutare47> Dumb question but was it the same controller?
[0:07:52] <MonsieurHonHon> Ghost runner on pc is a port?
[0:07:55] <DatAsuna> wait which playstation did he play on yesterday?
[0:07:57] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe because its the ps4 version on the ps5
[0:07:58] <andre11dr> You'd think it would be the other way around, but i guess the developer prioritized the PC
[0:08:04] <%livlinn> weeeeee fixing relationship time shiaHypers
[0:08:05] <leith_aziz> Actually, was PC the OG port
[0:08:06] <@Menitta> It does look significantly better on PC yeah
[0:08:06] <@Solidus_113> you can get that RTX ray tracing on PC too
[0:08:07] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:08:10] <+Hasmeister96> @dds333a thanks
[0:08:16] <%Daskolin> Oh yeah that suck =\
[0:08:24] <@Menitta> yeah but that was the mouse wasnt it?
[0:08:25] <Equirah> @leith_aziz yeah, it was developed with pc in mind
[0:08:30] <brachydios777> How did that happen?
[0:08:30] <dds333a> @hasmeister96 NP
[0:08:36] <BlackermanZX> weird. maybe playing the ps4 version on ps5 is really botched
[0:08:40] <quipquest1> Just another reason for the "PC Master Race" to gloat
[0:08:49] <masterfire23> so will you give the abomination another try?
[0:08:59] <Blank9> second gig
[0:08:59] <@Solidus_113> yeah that's pixel skipping, high sensitivity and low DPI does that, probably a weird engine thing on the consoles
[0:08:59] <+Hasmeister96> Hasmeister96 subscribed with Prime.
[0:09:04] <%KiwamiKiryu> what are we talking about?
[0:09:05] <andre11dr> Long live the mustard race
[0:09:08] <Equirah> @masterfire23 abomination is nt needed
[0:09:13] <dds333a> Well, of course, he barely dipped his toes
[0:09:16] <Lancaster_H> COWARD
[0:09:18] <brachydios777> How’s the port on Xbox chat?
[0:09:24] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus upload it all as an april's fools episode LUL
[0:09:29] <+IronChefWookie> what game?
[0:09:30] <BlackermanZX> thank god for pc mustard race
[0:09:36] <masterfire23> @equirah but it's funny though
[0:09:48] <dds333a> @equirah absolutely amazing idea
[0:09:54] <@Menitta> That's odd because I did not have any issues with the PS4 version. It worked flawless for me. Not to be that guy of "Works for me" but still
[0:10:03] <TysonSirius> What game?
[0:10:11] <+Jiggisnipe> Ghostrunner
[0:10:13] <leith_aziz> Ghostrunner on PS4
[0:10:13] <brachydios777> Ghost runner
[0:10:15] <andre11dr> Because funny
[0:10:19] <TysonSirius> Thanks!
[0:10:19] <%ekodrop> was it cause of the jank controller?
[0:10:23] <%dirkfunk1> i see some metacritic reviews agreeing on the port
[0:10:28] <%sillyschlub> yup makes sense
[0:10:28] <andre11dr> But funny tho
[0:10:29] <%Daskolin> @quipquest1 Pc dont even need to gloat. Ps3 and vita store is closed. They didnt even warn VITA devs, indie devs(actually good ones) almost got rekt by it.
[0:10:31] <Lancaster_H> all jokes aside you could add some snippets before the start of the actual lp @WoolieVersus
[0:10:32] <DatAsuna> that's a shame
[0:10:37] <+TensecondTarvis> it seemed jank cause of your sensitivity
[0:10:40] <%ekodrop> that's balls
[0:10:42] <dds333a> @menitta don't worry, I get you. I played it on a friend's PS4
[0:10:47] <+TensecondTarvis> seemed a bit high
[0:10:48] <brachydios777> Is the Xbox port borked?
[0:10:53] <%dirkfunk1> im not really sure what the point of consoles are anymore
[0:10:56] <DatAsuna> but glad to hear it has good gamepad controls, on the right platform
[0:10:56] <+invalid_robin> ahhh that's lame
[0:11:00] <+aishman> That sucks dude. Glad the PC version works for you though
[0:11:08] <BlackermanZX> you played it on a ps5 right?
[0:11:08] <leith_aziz> Seems like its just not well made for consoles
[0:11:15] <%X2Eliah> Sounds like acceleration
[0:11:33] <+RyTYoung> Hey doods
[0:11:36] <Lancaster_H> thats low dpi / high sens pixel skipping, usually
[0:11:40] <rusell4> I watched that this morning. There was a part where Woolie had a long dying streak that had me cracking up until my stomach hurt. I love this channel.
[0:11:48] <brachydios777> Ah, that sucks
[0:11:48] <@Menitta> I'm downloading this now. I'm so confused
[0:11:51] <+RyTYoung> What game?
[0:11:54] <+aishman> At least you had a better time than Pat with Kenshin
[0:11:57] <leith_aziz> Ghostrunner

[0:15:05] <%jonblnt> Is this the first coop game you and Woolie have Played?
[0:15:09] <ZComiX> Since Woolie usually teaches you about games, What is a game you would like to introduce Woolie to?
[0:15:11] <andre11dr> Reggie are you a sigma male?
[0:15:14] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie confirmed Testament player
[0:15:21] <+iLike_femboys> this is your time reggie finish the game on your own
[0:15:21] <+Sillypeacock> Elphelt
[0:15:22] <OldManDeckardCain> reggie, be careful. do you actually want to play against testament and zappa LUL
[0:15:23] <dds333a> Absolutely
[0:15:23] <DatAsuna> It gets better
[0:15:25] <leith_aziz> I would love a new GG character
[0:15:46] <+Jiggisnipe> Mario Galaxy I guess
[0:15:53] <%KiwamiKiryu> Galaxy
[0:15:55] <%ekodrop> spec ops?
[0:15:56] <+b_aleph> @oldmandeckardcain yeah, he wants the most busted characters from XX LUL
[0:15:58] <Louie_Salmon> Jujutsu kaisen seemed painfully generic based on the first episode, does it get less generic?
[0:16:00] <derap41> Tiny Woolie is judging you from behind
[0:16:02] <+NickHatesSnow> Vanquish
[0:16:03] <%X2Eliah> So just between us all, how addicted is Woolie to gacha card games actually?
[0:16:04] <AMDBR9S> ninjala?
[0:16:05] <Shadowjojo77> @woolieversus favorite place you have ever traveled to?

[0:16:20] <brachydios777> Something I noticed is that Arcsys doesn’t do guest characters except for Blazblue tag
[0:16:24] <leith_aziz> I donnt know. I dont want Testament back
[0:16:25] <SunsetJack> Cause that is worst.
[0:16:30] <rusell4> Order Sol is fun
[0:16:41] <+Mrbaconator> TOTSUGEKI
[0:16:48] <+b_aleph> I'd be down for Zappa. Testament frightens me
[0:16:51] <Louie_Salmon> I've heard good things, certainly
[0:16:57] <nailwind> i really dislike jujutsu, might be the most soulless shounen but the production value is Kreygasm
[0:16:58] <T_Sasquatch> Its very anime, I'll say that
[0:16:59] <rusell4> 1st episode is just the set up.
[0:17:01] <%livlinn> psaWrong

[0:17:19] <andre11dr> I want Testament back, like fuck it you'll get someone whose bullshit anyway
[0:17:20] <%X2Eliah> It's really not hard to be a better Naruto than Naruto
[0:17:22] <leith_aziz> @brachydios777: They are considering having guest character after they're finished with the narrative
[0:17:24] <+TheLastStar> Bedman tho LUL
[0:17:28] <@Solidus_113> ABA would actually be great
[0:17:32] <nailwind> Naruto legit had one of the best first episodes

[0:18:30] <%hax_metatron> https://gachax.com/game_db/teppen/
[0:18:31] <@Commando_Joe> https://gachax.com/game_db/teppen/
[0:18:32] <NeonBleu> can you just buy the card you want?
[0:18:33] <%KiwamiKiryu> Is slight gacha like Dissidia OO
[0:18:34] <SomersaultJustice> how do you get new cards in teppen?
[0:18:34] <%kewlmyc> You gamble for cards right?
[0:18:34] <leith_aziz> It kinda is?
[0:18:37] <%livlinn> Overwatch?
[0:18:37] <Louie_Salmon> LUL
[0:18:37] <dds333a> People have discussed this
[0:18:37] <Equirah> it's a different form of gacha
[0:18:40] <+Superbro64> I guess no one in chat actually plays gatcha games Kappa
[0:18:41] <%X2Eliah> Idk man, booster packs to me seem like gacha
[0:18:41] <+invalid_robin> Magic is a Gatch tbh
[0:18:42] <+aishman> Naw Teppen is just a CCG
[0:18:42] <+Jiggisnipe> if the cards you receive are random then yes it's a gacha
[0:18:44] <Tooniearcade> It sounds like gacha
[0:18:44] <AMDBR9S> cards cost monmey and do u buy packs that you dont know whats in there?
[0:18:46] <brachydios777> Card games are gacha
[0:18:46] <Louie_Salmon> Hit 'em with the official link
[0:18:49] <prime_name> Card Games was the OG gatcha
[0:18:51] <EternalJedi> Gachas are literally all about buying booster packs
[0:18:52] <AMDBR9S> if so gacha
[0:18:56] <@Solidus_113> buying PNGs that do things for your game
[0:18:59] <@Commando_Joe> Yup
[0:18:59] <%hax_metatron> YES
[0:19:00] <+TenKaiHunter> Gatcha isn't a game, its a feature.
[0:19:00] <redrins> just because someone put it on a gacha database doesn't mean its a gacha, its a tcg that's all there is
[0:19:00] <%KiwamiKiryu> Ye
[0:19:00] <%ekodrop> sure
[0:19:01] <%hax_metatron> YESSSS

[0:19:04] <@Solidus_113> YES
[0:19:05] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> YES
[0:19:05] <Louie_Salmon> Absolutely
[0:19:05] <DatAsuna> Gacha is derived from card game packs but not every card game is gacha
[0:19:06] <andre11dr> It not the most aggressive gatcha but you still spend money on cards
[0:19:06] <sendart> Yes
[0:19:06] <%X2Eliah> I mean it's a huge money pit
[0:19:07] <notorious_rng> card games are the original gacha
[0:19:09] <leith_aziz> probably
[0:19:09] <+ja07sj> yeah booster packs
[0:19:09] <+sketchpickles> YES WOOLIE
[0:19:11] <@Menitta> That's dumb
[0:19:11] <balthazar758> gotcha woolie
[0:19:13] <+Hasmeister96> no, Legends of Runeterra isn't gacha
[0:19:14] <%ShogunNoonto> yes
[0:19:14] <passserby> same philosophy yes
[0:19:15] <%DiscoMatador> Boosters
[0:19:15] <%justcallmebobplease> Are you paying for RNG chance for stuff? It's Gacha.
[0:19:15] <Tooniearcade> Yes
[0:19:16] <vidgmes> card packs are surprise mechanics
[0:19:18] <%hax_metatron> EVERY EA GAME IS GACHA
[0:19:19] <DatAsuna> yes
[0:19:20] <EternalJedi> by the criteria of what a gacha is, then TCGs count
[0:19:21] <%jinking79> yes
[0:19:24] <leith_aziz> yes
[0:19:25] <dds333a> one could say
[0:19:26] <JetpackMcQuack> semantic wars
[0:19:26] <+DenpaDev> you got gatchyad
[0:19:27] <$arcielardor> Woolie is pure, shut up
[0:19:27] <%KiwamiKiryu> If you don't know what your getting is gacha
[0:19:27] <+Jiggisnipe> card packs are the same as gacha
[0:19:27] <brachydios777> If you get random cards you can pay for then yes
[0:19:28] <%livlinn> YE
[0:19:30] <andre11dr> YES
[0:19:32] <+walt_chocolate> SEX is GATCHA SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:19:32] <leith_aziz> 100%
[0:19:35] <%X2Eliah> OK Gacha is maybe not the right word, but like, games that are huge money sinks
[0:19:37] <Louie_Salmon> Buying for random chance is the thing
[0:19:37] <@Menitta> Apparently Xenoblade Chronicles 2 counts as gacha.
[0:19:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's the og lootbox
[0:19:40] <%justcallmebobplease> You have to buy RNG stuff, not just buy a bonus.
[0:19:40] <Dakuu75> loot boxes
[0:19:41] <DatAsuna> Lootboxes = gacha
[0:19:42] <%Kalixas> Woolie, Magic the Gathering makes even the worst gatcha game look fair
[0:19:43] <T_Sasquatch> everything is gacha
[0:19:43] <@Solidus_113> you know gachapon machines?
[0:19:44] <$arcielardor> now REGGIE however
[0:19:45] <dds333a> KEKW
[0:19:46] <%livlinn> LIFE IS GACHA
[0:19:46] <+Jiggisnipe> loot boxes are gacha too
[0:19:47] <@Menitta> Which is bullshit because you can't pay for it
[0:19:47] <maskedmook> booster packs are just 10 rolls
[0:19:52] <derap41> Its Japanese for Skinner box
[0:19:53] <leith_aziz> Games that tempt you to buy something
[0:19:54] <EternalJedi> yes
[0:19:56] <+Jiggisnipe> gacha cosmetics
[0:19:57] <Equirah> YES WOOLIE
[0:19:59] <+sketchpickles> YES
[0:20:00] <DatAsuna> Gacha is just the japanese name for lootbox
[0:20:00] <+DenpaDev> But you can buy what you want with gold?
[0:20:01] <Louie_Salmon> Just cosmetics, so not gacha
[0:20:01] <%Kalixas> They have horrible predatory business practices
[0:20:01] <EternalJedi> Overwatch has a gacha element
[0:20:02] <sendart> yes
[0:20:03] <Darren716> Woolie OW is gatcha
[0:20:03] <brachydios777> If you get random characters/ cards you pay for then yes
[0:20:03] <Equirah> it's literally gacha LUL
[0:20:05] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[0:20:05] <andre11dr> Just because it's not the worst version of it ,it doesn't mean it's not gatcha
[0:20:05] <Prevot> that's a gacha system
[0:20:06] <heart_ablaze> is fortnite gacha then ?
[0:20:07] <%TubeMan642> Is Destiny a Gacha game
[0:20:08] <dds333a> If monetary exchange is all it takes, then I guedd
[0:20:09] <@Solidus_113> gachapon machines that you pay for a random item
[0:20:14] <+walt_chocolate> intercourse is gatcha HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:20:16] <+DoomRedMage> Fifa is Gacha
[0:20:18] <OldManDeckardCain> little did woolie know, he is surrounded by gacha LUL
[0:20:18] <derap41> Skin that box
[0:20:21] <dds333a> *guess
[0:20:22] <%X2Eliah> .... sounds like booster packs
[0:20:25] <masterfire23> OW lootboxes are insanely generous
[0:20:28] <+Jiggisnipe> any random item is a gacha essentially
[0:20:28] <+Superbro64> spending money for a random chance at a gameplay effecting character, item, card, etc. @WoolieVersus
[0:20:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> FIFA is BIG gacha
[0:20:29] <brachydios777> If the lootbox is part of the gameplay
[0:20:37] <andre11dr> Teppen fits that description fully
[0:20:41] <+Jiggisnipe> yep Fifa is gacha too
[0:20:44] <@Menitta> I see this as projection. This is an attempt to normalize their virtual drug addiction
[0:20:44] <%hax_metatron> BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE: See also Microtransaction Loot box
[0:20:48] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you get overwatch lootboxes so often I wouldn't count it
[0:20:49] <T_Sasquatch> gambling woooooooo
[0:20:50] <%Daskolin> Lootbox integrated into gameplay
[0:20:52] <JetpackMcQuack> japanese for loot box
[0:20:53] <%KiwamiKiryu> Are NFT gacha?
[0:20:53] <brachydios777> Yes
[0:20:54] <leith_aziz> no
[0:20:56] <%justcallmebobplease> Gacha is a BEHEMOTH
[0:20:56] <%ekodrop> yes
[0:20:56] <leith_aziz> Yes
[0:20:57] <DatAsuna> Gacha is just a mechanic yes
[0:20:57] <Equirah> Nope
[0:20:58] <+NiktenKing> yes
[0:20:58] <%X2Eliah> true
[0:20:58] <+Jiggisnipe> it's both
[0:20:59] <Dakuu75> yes
[0:21:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gacha is a mechanic
[0:21:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> correct
[0:21:00] <Equirah> Yup
[0:21:04] <%X2Eliah> Sounds like it
[0:21:04] <@Solidus_113> most of the time
[0:21:05] <andre11dr> Yes
[0:21:05] <%justcallmebobplease> Gacha is a mechanic, yes.
[0:21:06] <+NiktenKing> there is a gacha Pinball gamr
[0:21:08] <DatAsuna> Gacha RPGs, Gacha Shooters, Gacha character action
[0:21:10] <EternalJedi> Gacha is an element that is either more or less prevalent
[0:21:10] <Equirah> Gacha is a delivery mechanic
[0:21:11] <%justcallmebobplease> YES
[0:21:13] <%X2Eliah> ... yes
[0:21:13] <dds333a> Well, yeah, it was always a mechanic
[0:21:13] <brachydios777> Yee
[0:21:14] <prime_name> Yes
[0:21:14] <+ja07sj> It's a mechanic in a game
[0:21:16] <%kewlmyc> Yes.
[0:21:16] <maskedmook> yeah
[0:21:16] <leith_aziz> Whats a gacha game ?
[0:21:17] <+Superbro64> the genre is kinda built around the main gacha mechanic, if you think of it like that @WoolieVersus
[0:21:17] <lonosis47> Do the camers really need to be this zoomed in??? ffs..
[0:21:21] <%X2Eliah> Yeah that is a good way to put it
[0:21:21] <@Menitta> so Teppen isnt a Gacha game.
[0:21:22] <+sketchpickles> FF7 is a gach- oh.. wait nicobD nicobD
[0:21:22] <+X1asdfghjkl1x> YEEEA BOI
[0:21:23] <andre11dr> Gatcha is a feature
[0:21:23] <+kewlmyc> Gacha was never a genre
[0:21:24] <+Stormzcales_Lair> The Logic is sound
[0:21:24] <+walt_chocolate> its surprise mechanics!
[0:21:27] <%X2Eliah> it "contains" gacha
[0:21:29] <%ekodrop> yup
[0:21:31] <Louie_Salmon> There is a certain genre that uses it the most, but yes
[0:21:31] <dds333a> I thought we were referring to the genre of games where that is all there is
[0:21:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> a gacha game has the gacha at its core, but non gacha games can have gacha
[0:21:36] <EternalJedi> Gacha as a genre is a game specifically built around the gacha mechanic as part of the core gameplay loop
[0:21:38] <+Jiggisnipe> most of those gacha mobile games are gacha rpgs
[0:21:40] <Dakuu75> trash
[0:21:41] <masterfire23> cash grabs
[0:21:41] <DatAsuna> Most of them are just very barren RPGs

[0:21:46] <leith_aziz> Forced ?
[0:21:47] <+RyTYoung> TRASH
[0:21:48] <sendart> Not games
[0:21:48] <DSD24> Slot Machines?
[0:21:48] <%Daskolin> Gambling
[0:21:48] <brachydios777> You don’t get your characters from the lootbox in Overwatch
[0:21:50] <+DenpaDev> degenerate
[0:21:51] <%KiwamiKiryu> Trash
[0:21:51] <Equirah> Gacha traps LUL
[0:21:51] <%X2Eliah> hypergacha?
[0:21:52] <%ekodrop> raising games?
[0:21:52] <DatAsuna> Or barebones strategy games
[0:21:53] <+Hasmeister96> pachinko
[0:21:53] <leith_aziz> Slot machine
[0:21:53] <%Daskolin> Pachinko
[0:21:53] <redrins> do those even exist? LUL
[0:21:53] <JetpackMcQuack> a shitty gacha game
[0:21:55] <Prevot> pretty sure there's always something to do
[0:21:56] <%sillyschlub> pachinko
[0:21:56] <$arcielardor> EA sports games are gatcha
[0:21:57] <leith_aziz> Pachinko
[0:21:58] <%kewlmyc> They ususally have RPG mechanics attached like Granblue and FGO
[0:22:00] <Louie_Salmon> What games?
[0:22:02] <prime_name> Pachinko
[0:22:04] <@Menitta> no pachinko is different
[0:22:05] <dds333a> @qsmash_ at that point those are just clickers
[0:22:07] <DSD24> FGO has a story too
[0:22:12] <Qsmash_> is there any game that is nothing but gacha and no gameplay?
[0:22:14] <DSD24> Same with Granblue
[0:22:14] <+HanhTai> pokemon cards
[0:22:15] <Equirah> predatory shit LUL
[0:22:15] <@Menitta> Pachinko isnt collection
[0:22:15] <andre11dr> MAHJONG MACHINES
[0:22:17] <DatAsuna> those are usually called like Social games, like facebook stuff
[0:22:17] <%KiwamiKiryu> which one? because even fate games have gameplay
[0:22:17] <+Jiggisnipe> they are usually some genre usually a basic rpg or tactics thing
[0:22:18] <+NiktenKing> collection
[0:22:20] <DatAsuna> or clickers lol
[0:22:20] <+RyTYoung> Collectathon?
[0:22:21] <JetpackMcQuack> collectathons
[0:22:21] <+walt_chocolate> suprise mechanics
[0:22:22] <redrins> granblue is a gacha rpg
[0:22:22] <dds333a> Like shinrabansho or whatever
[0:22:24] <SomersaultJustice> there is normally a game aside from the gacha in mobile games
[0:22:26] <+FuriousCabinBoy> Yo, who remembers DragonVale?
[0:22:28] <dds333a> but even that is food
[0:22:29] <+Superbro64> mobile game that are literally just the pull the lever gambling machines do exist
[0:22:30] <+NiktenKing> visual novels
[0:22:32] <leith_aziz> Doesnt DMC also have Pachinko ?
[0:22:34] <brachydios777> If you pay for a random chance to get a character or card it’s gatcha
[0:22:34] <leith_aziz> Dammit
[0:22:48] <%kewlmyc> Most of the mobile games you are thinking of are basic RPGs with gacha mechanics
[0:22:55] <andre11dr> That's just a casino Woolie
[0:22:55] <%Daskolin> Woolie remember that words can change meaning!!!
[0:22:59] <%X2Eliah> Maybe distinguishing between Gacha-Only vs Gacha+GameType
[0:23:04] <JetpackMcQuack> You can slap RNG on anything
[0:23:05] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie, how many fighting games are fighting games, that other people don't recognize as fighting games because they don't know the genre?
[0:23:07] <andre11dr> A virtual casino
[0:23:07] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah they always had gameplay, no one would care otherwise
[0:23:11] <EternalJedi> there's usually some form of gameplay outside of the gacha, but the Gacha genre has the Gacha as part of the core gameplay loop
[0:23:16] <+Jiggisnipe> I guess if the only point is to collect and nothing else then sure it's pure gacha
[0:23:18] <Prevot> they're in denial
[0:23:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they can be mad but it's still gacha
[0:23:21] <+walt_chocolate> nah we know its gatcha
[0:23:23] <%livlinn> Horse girls are the trend in the moment.
[0:23:27] <%X2Eliah> All addicts / gamblers get mad if you point out they are addicted or gamble tho
[0:23:27] <Prevot> card games are pure gacha
[0:23:31] <lonosis47> Woolie does wrong information part 3
[0:23:36] <DatAsuna> Me either, I need a fun game to convince me to roll
[0:23:36] <BlackermanZX> pull the lever snake doodBait
[0:23:39] <leith_aziz> @justcallmebobplease: DBFZ and Tekken I guess
[0:23:41] <dds333a> absolutely
[0:23:43] <%MajorCrasher> there's very few games that are just pulls Woolie
[0:23:55] <andre11dr> Woolie waa wrong, what brave new horizons
[0:23:57] <%X2Eliah> Oh yeah these lootbox / gacha stuffs have become hugely important
[0:24:01] <+Hasmeister96> @livelinne Uma-musume?
[0:24:01] <%X2Eliah> in so many games
[0:24:02] <redrins> been playing gacha games for years, never seen one where the entire game is just pulling
[0:24:03] <%kewlmyc> I can't think of a popular gacha game that is JUST pulling for units. The units have to do some sort of gameplay function.
[0:24:05] <JetpackMcQuack> Randomized rewards kinamaPog
[0:24:06] <+TheotherKristian> Hey, is Horizon Zero Dawn worth it for $35 CAD on GOG, if I already have it on PS4?
[0:24:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but that's usually a cosmetic, gacha games are you rolling for a character or an item with stats
[0:24:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> If you play a game that literally is only getting lootbox items then you're actually insane
[0:24:11] <Louie_Salmon> FGO is a game with gacha, FeH is a game with gacha, they were always real games with gacha
[0:24:13] <DSD24> Nah its never just pulling
[0:24:13] <Dakuu75> good talk
[0:24:14] <brachydios777> Card games are the original gatcha
[0:24:16] <%SuckerPunchSyd> The gatcha is following you
[0:24:17] <EternalJedi> the Gacha genre is when the gacha gives items that are part of the core gameplay, not necessarily cosmetic
[0:24:20] <+walt_chocolate> woolie sex is a gatcha Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:24:23] <%MajorCrasher> there's almost always some game, whether simple or complex
[0:24:23] <DatAsuna> Fire Emblem Gacha for example is still a strategy game
[0:24:25] <+Jiggisnipe> it's ok Woolie, people always refer to gacha games only which is vague as to the gameplay loop
[0:24:26] <%bread_assassin> Pure gatcha just doesn't make sense for me. The reason why the rarer pulls are worthwhile is because of their value in the gameplay side.
[0:24:30] <dds333a> A game with just pulls is a gallery viewer
[0:24:33] <Dakuu75> @walt_chocolate NOOOOOOOO~! lmao
[0:24:34] <+RyTYoung> "The More You Know" *rainbow effect*
[0:24:34] <leith_aziz> How does FE Heroes work ?
[0:24:35] <dds333a> for cool shit

[0:42:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @robosqueeb i do agree
[0:42:30] <DatAsuna> "I dislike this art style, therefore if anyone likes it that threatens it to become the only art style"
[0:42:34] <%hologram_sam> what a great level
[0:42:34] <leith_aziz> @robosqueeb You get talks like that a LOT when it comes to anime games, but thats another topic
[0:42:43] <+Superbro64> are you just going to continue with that, or are you gonna do something else
[0:42:44] <+sketchpickles> thats not very poggers xenofl2Angry

[0:46:46] <+Superbro64> right next to lava lamps
[0:46:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> I just found out the other day that they make these in different colors
[0:46:50] <%X2Eliah> How often do you have to change the batteries on these?
[0:46:50] <+Superbro64> and cool looking flowers
[0:46:54] <Solidnick18> oh sick

[0:47:24] <leith_aziz> Y'know, I feel like this sorta shit talk tends to come up a lot in Anime games for example (im not talking about this game in that case. Just a thought im having right now) Its all about artstyles seeming childish instead of being percieved as different.
[0:47:30] <%X2Eliah> .... Honest question, why doesn't Big Reggie just lift Woolie up on those platforms
[0:47:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> @X2Eliah I feel like most of the ones I've seen just plug into the wall like a normal lamp
[0:47:43] <T_Sasquatch> @X2Eliah shhhhh
[0:47:48] <%ThisIsLloyd> why doesn't the big one simply eat the smaller one
[0:48:04] <dds333a> @thisislloyd Damn you

[0:51:03] <dds333a> I guess he wanted to
[0:51:05] <MrPandastic> @garody Because it's a fun game?
[0:51:08] <dds333a> idk, it's fun
[0:51:09] <leith_aziz> I wish the Book had more interesting stuff to say. He's kinda being repetetive
[0:51:10] <%MajorCrasher> @garody because it's a fun game?
[0:51:11] <Equirah> @garody dude, we just had a one guy, don't be second guy

[0:51:56] <%TopTierHarley> No IT2 slander
[0:51:57] <%X2Eliah> Let's be real not every game needs to be a HALO-COD gunsexual fantasy. So chill.
[0:52:00] <%Daskolin> @garody Because this is not Fortnite?
[0:52:05] <dds333a> Whoa, this is sweet
[0:52:21] <DatAsuna> ah didn't know that
[0:52:22] <%X2Eliah> Only local coop or remote works too?
[0:52:24] <leith_aziz> In this day and age, no matter what you play you will be judged for liking a game, and it makes you feel bad. Nice work people
[0:52:31] <DatAsuna> @X2Eliah it has remote
[0:52:34] <aiutare47> @brachydios777 I thought the same. It kinda sounds like Price, but it could also just be the default gruff British voice.
[0:52:36] <%jonblnt> YOU HAVE TO SCREEN CHEAT
[0:52:37] <%TopTierHarley> remote as well
[0:52:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> @X2Eliah I think it's got online and it's still splitscreen
[0:52:51] <sullivansbizarreadventure> @x2eliah I’ve never heard the term “gunsexual.” Thank you for this information.
[0:52:53] <%X2Eliah> @DatAsuna Ok that's good... if it was local only, whoo boy that's DoA
[0:52:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Does it have a thing like a way out where you could have an online dude with you?
[0:52:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> SCREEN PEAKING DansGame
[0:53:05] <PMda2nd> does it count as screen cheating?
[0:53:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Or is it like full next to couch co op?
[0:53:11] <dds333a> Gunsexuality is very real
[0:53:19] <%X2Eliah> @sullivansbizarreadventure use it well :)
[0:53:22] <T_Sasquatch> c o l l a b o r a t i o n
[0:53:37] <DedlokPM> @garody Because it is fun and has an interesting premise? Also because it is co-op and has potential for hilarious shenanigans and comedy?

[0:53:57] <%TopTierHarley> wait is someone hating on this game?
[0:53:57] <%X2Eliah> Yeeah it would be so toxic
[0:54:02] <leith_aziz> So....among us?
[0:54:06] <%X2Eliah> without splitscreen
[0:54:07] <DedlokPM> @garody also because it is his channel and he can do what ever the fuck he wants
[0:54:10] <dds333a> It would be like that bomb defusing game
[0:54:11] <%jonblnt> split screen for a reason
[0:54:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's what Portal 2 is for

[0:59:03] <%TopTierHarley> I mean they'll be confused by the A Way Out dolls saying "Fuck you"
[0:59:04] <Equirah> this is a game that shoudln't be played by kids
[0:59:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> There was an uncensored shit earlier
[0:59:09] <MrPandastic> Teaching kids that the Oscars suck at an early age is a good lesson.
[0:59:13] <+iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus im so happy you found that easter egg
[0:59:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> "Who's Oscar and why is he so mad at him? BibleThump "
[0:59:30] <%gatorafan> Who the hell buys their kids a game about divorce? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:59:31] <dds333a> @equirah nah, it's totally a children's game, just not entirely
[0:59:34] <leith_aziz> Since Oscar is name, it would just be confusing
[0:59:49] <%X2Eliah> Imagine finding that and being named Oscar xD
[0:59:51] <dds333a> A kid could play it, but a lot might go over their head

[1:00:16] <%livlinn> 2020Pajamas 2020Party
[1:00:17] <T_Sasquatch> honestly chat , what defines a kids game.
[1:00:23] <+Jiggisnipe> real question
[1:00:24] <+Kitrane> this game will definitely give a kid a colorful vocabulary if they havent gotten one from their parents.
[1:00:27] <Equirah> @dds333a the way it's handling the theme isn't really how you introduce "divorce" to your kids LUL
[1:00:29] <UncleOliver> fuck all oscars

[1:00:48] <%X2Eliah> ... Idk man, afaik a ton of 12-14 year olds play GTA games so everything goes
[1:00:50] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[1:00:59] <%TopTierHarley> LUL

[1:01:07] <%jonblnt> WHOA WHOA WHOA
[1:01:09] <dds333a> @equirah a child may not even catch it, but they totally could too. I can only assume the game has a positive bent to it
[1:01:11] <+iLike_femboys> i love this game
[1:01:14] <Dakuu75> YEET
[1:01:16] <brachydios777> LUL
[1:01:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @deceitfulgemini
[1:01:19] <%Daskolin> @gatorafan Same karens who buy their 6 y.o. kid game about warcrimes and harcore torture. Aslo hentai. Cuz they dont read the box
[1:01:25] <%gatorafan> One of the good things Fortnite did
[1:01:30] <leith_aziz> I wonder if the OG Ratchet and Clank Trilogy would be considered a Kids game. Not really I feel
[1:01:32] <%livlinn> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[1:01:43] <T_Sasquatch> @DSD24 obviously a game can exist to be played anyone. thats like saying fifa is a kids game
[1:01:57] <leith_aziz> There's a lot of themes that would just go over your head. Though I did play them as a kid
[1:01:59] <%gatorafan> being popular with them kids without being so graphic
[1:02:06] <dds333a> I'd definitely say Ratchet and Clank is a kids game too
[1:02:08] <+Kitrane> I played the crap out of ratchet and clank of when I was a kid.
[1:02:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't get over just HOW small you get when you shrink it's wild
[1:02:22] <MrPandastic> I was a Sly Cooper Boy myself.
[1:02:23] <dds333a> It's just simulated violence
[1:02:31] <%X2Eliah> Tbh GTA 3 was hella fun to play as a 13y.o.
[1:02:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> ericba2Little so little ericba2Little
[1:02:35] <Dakuu75> OOOH, I didn't even notice that
[1:02:36] <aiutare47> Ok that’s kinda cool
[1:02:43] <+ja07sj> bodied
[1:02:47] <+Kitrane> I was the quadfecta. Sly, Ratchet, Jak, and Rayman
[1:02:52] <leith_aziz> Sly Cooper gets even better as you grow up. Really good series
[1:03:15] <%gatorafan> I played Sonic 1 daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:03:18] <Equirah> @dds333a so far it's only had a very unhealthy messaging of "love conquers all, just work harder and ignore incompatibilities"
[1:03:18] <T_Sasquatch> personally i think a kids game is defined by its mechanics not by its artsytle
[1:03:18] <leith_aziz> I played Jak Trilogy and RC3 as a kid. Not Sly though sadly.
[1:03:31] <glass_marcus> did they just stealth release mario galaxy 3 with this game?
[1:03:34] <T_Sasquatch> i think its really reductive to say an artstyle is simple for kids
[1:03:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:37] <leith_aziz> @T_Sasquatch: ^
[1:03:54] <dds333a> @equirah "Love conquers all" is all. a kid needs to hear
[1:03:58] <T_Sasquatch> simply*
[1:04:04] <%X2Eliah> Pure?
[1:04:04] <leith_aziz> The whole "Cartoons are for kids" argument is stupid. Its an artstyle
[1:04:07] <%X2Eliah> call it Pure
[1:04:08] <dds333a> @gatorafan same
[1:04:08] <+FuqBoiSlim> Happy Tree Friends is a kids show Kappa
[1:04:17] <%Kalixas> Damn straight it is
[1:04:19] <%ekodrop> inlay
[1:04:27] <+Kitrane> Except taxes. Taxes dont give a fuck about love. kids need to learn that early
[1:04:30] <%X2Eliah> @FuqBoiSlim mmm that's a deep pull
[1:04:32] <MrPandastic> @leith_aziz The same argument that arose when Wind Waker came out.
[1:04:34] <coreybom> @fuqboislim Kids need to learn about anatomy after all.
[1:04:59] <Equirah> @dds333a that's an unhealthy expectation of how relationships work
[1:05:01] <dds333a> @x2eliah could be deeper, even
[1:05:04] <aiutare47> @equirah I’m hoping there’s a “reveal” of sorts at the end where we find this is the simplified way Rose sees the world, and her parents have the “1 love, 2 houses” talk.
[1:05:13] <glass_marcus> Mario galaxy died and was reborn into this game
[1:05:26] <DedlokPM> Clapped
[1:05:35] <%gatorafan> Oh yeah, Mario got fucked it murdered right? daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:05:39] <aiutare47> Wait a sec this is literally a Mario galaxy level
[1:05:44] <%gatorafan> dammit phone
[1:05:46] <leith_aziz> @MrPandastic: im actually curious, is that the same argument people use for games with Anime artstyles ? Wether its anime or games that use that Aesthetic. I disagree personally
[1:05:51] <dds333a> @equirah The first part is a good message, the rest is something a kid won't understand, and literally few parents teach their kids about "reality" from the outset
[1:05:57] <T_Sasquatch> s.t.a.rs
[1:06:03] <+Kitrane> I get a 50/50 vibe on whether this ends in reconcile or 'fuck that book, burn it, then oets get the divorce rolling'
[1:06:17] <dds333a> Children's media is full of stuff that just isn't the reality for most people
[1:06:26] <%X2Eliah> It probably should end with the kid dying tbh
[1:06:33] <%X2Eliah> If ya want a twitst
[1:06:33] <aiutare47> @kitrane If it ain’t the latter I’m going to think it’s a copout
[1:06:42] <leith_aziz> It'll probably be the expected nice ending, which is fine as its still an arc that gets finished
[1:06:46] <%MajorCrasher> @kitrane I mean I feel like they should burn the book even if they do reconcile
[1:07:00] <leith_aziz> A twist for the sake of a twist is not good
[1:07:09] <+Kitrane> oh yea. no matter what fuck the abusive stereotype book
[1:07:30] <dds333a> This one might take some doing
[1:07:35] <$genocidal_cupcake> Just got here’s, what’s up?
[1:07:43] <lonosis47> A lot

[1:08:04] <%KineticZen> El Reginaldo wins again
[1:08:12] <%gatorafan> right now I am feeling a bit disconnect between the beginning of the game and the rest of it. But maybe there's still time for things to get addressed properly.
[1:08:14] <SCIENCE_25> The Champ is here?
[1:08:21] <T_Sasquatch> @duskrush console port is fucked, they will replay on pc
[1:08:23] <%X2Eliah> omg

[1:27:37] <Darren716> I mean you can buy her another one
[1:27:38] <+Kitrane> I'm pretty sure it was Dick Book that took her random mutterings and did all this
[1:27:40] <dds333a> Instead of the logical train of thought of the opposite of sadness being happiness
[1:27:40] <balthazar758> The Monke Was Right
[1:27:40] <dukenux> yea
[1:27:40] <%Samura1_Queen19> No
[1:27:40] <%TopTierHarley> Remember, they are assuming her tears will make them change back
[1:27:47] <Wild_Samurai> this game was just made from a long lost Jim Carrey comedy script
[1:27:49] <%CptnCampy61> YES
[1:27:51] <dukenux> id buy them a new one afterwards

[1:28:27] <dds333a> Lmao, hypocrite chat. although I'd do it too, my kid needs me
[1:28:31] <+Kitrane> I love how the parents just get more and more ignorant
[1:28:32] <shadowcrisis> Well to be honest, yes. The child would not be able to take care of herself without her parents if you think about it. So if it means destroying their favorite toy so 'I' As their parent can return, then yes
[1:28:52] <+sketchpickles> Objective: MAKE CHILD CRY nicobTears nicobTears nicobTears

[1:29:34] <%ekodrop> what is reggie doing
[1:29:34] <he1lhydra> it's not about the act of making the child cry to save yourself, its about them getting really giddy over doing it and thinking its a great idea
[1:29:55] <%doomerskeletor13> A Way Out also had minigames you could play with your partner. I think it’s a staple of their games at this point
[1:29:56] <%jonblnt> @he1lhydra agree
[1:29:59] <+Kitrane> yea the enthusiasm they show is what is fucked
[1:30:00] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Pictured: rose in the background

[1:30:22] <dds333a> They didn't even ask this time, best of three
[1:30:22] <%X2Eliah> Because that's what matters

[1:30:34] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieSMUG

[1:33:44] <Wild_Samurai> the jokes on them. I only hate MY parents =(
[1:33:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> nah, they aren't explicitly bad people, they're just sort of flawed

[3:07:54] <+glgzephyr> you know what this makes me think of? Multiplayer Magicka.
[3:08:12] <dds333a> Oh, this segment better have an amazing dungeon master
[3:08:19] <Orenjevel> oh man i havent thought about magicka in a while, now i want to play it again
[3:08:19] <naoi0> I'm glad there hasn'tbeen any ice or fire puns yet
[3:08:22] <%gatorafan> Now I want a Magicka LP
[3:08:36] <+glgzephyr> mission accomplished
[3:08:54] <Solidnick18> i only played magicka abit
[3:09:11] <+RealThiele> PoE labyrinth
[3:09:11] <+glgzephyr> me too, but the games seemed amazing from what I played
[3:09:11] <DedlokPM> @gatorafan with how much woolie dislikes keyboard I highly doubt we would get one. doodSad
[3:09:20] <+QueequegTheater> Wait when the fuck did this become Diablo
[3:09:21] <naoi0> take a chill pill, fuck
[3:09:28] <+ja07sj> magicka is something you have to play with friends, and its really designed for keyboards
[3:09:41] <DedlokPM> @QueequegTheater when we escaped toy joail
[3:10:03] <+ja07sj> so it was kinda hard to get a good game of Magicka going
[3:10:06] <dds333a> Of course, and then run around the arena destroying
[3:10:13] <Orenjevel> ahead of his time
[3:10:20] <+glgzephyr> isn't it just FPS games that Woolie won't use a keyboard for? Is he actually incapable of using the device?
[3:10:59] <Robot_Nixon_> that kid seeds his torrents, what a hero
[3:10:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:11:01] <+RealThiele> the arcade gauntlet legends was worse with more ppl because of shitty health drops solo you could actually play for awhile
[3:11:01] <naoi0> woolie keeps on dashing to his death
[3:11:11] <DedlokPM> @glgzephyr he can use them, but he hates trying to use them for games
[3:11:16] <Awarets> you only use the keyboard for picking spells in magicka, movement and aiming is done with mouse
[3:11:27] <dds333a> oh, is this it?
[3:11:29] <+glgzephyr> yeah I remember mostly using the mouse to play the game
[3:11:37] <naoi0> Thaat's spooky
[3:11:37] <dds333a> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:11:39] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie would use the keyboard cuz movement isn't attached to it
[3:11:41] <+glgzephyr> HA

[3:14:16] <DedlokPM> @QueequegTheater Yeah but that is solely because Squenix took the time to make the control scheme because they wanted it to be playable on consoles. Magicka devs did not take that time and resources

[3:28:21] <+ja07sj> Will you PULL THE LEVER to save your spouse, and let the innocent die?
[3:28:23] <BlackermanZX> no fuck you LUL
[3:28:24] <scrumbotime> Not when that book is involved
[3:28:26] <+RealThiele> letter just says "get a divorce"
[3:28:26] <Louie_Salmon> Well, he's a genie and the kid made a wish.
[3:28:27] <+SuperKirby24> NO FUCK YOU LUL
[3:28:28] <Draco_Renegade> This is some weird ass couples therapy
[3:28:29] <travelingwolfapples> THE BOOK DOESN'T CARE
[3:28:29] <%lostcolors> you will make it work or you will DIE
[3:28:32] <+NickHatesSnow> This is straight up Rachet and Clank: Crack in Time Clank levels now
[3:28:32] <Picosunloaded> Stay together for ever
[3:28:34] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Breaking up is not in the Bibble
[3:28:36] <dds333a> It's for Rose's sake
[3:28:36] <+DoomRedMage> Only death
[3:28:39] <Tracazoid> No, you must ride or die through toxic relationships apparently
[3:28:39] <+iLike_femboys> is not really cloning then
[3:28:41] <+allups> no that's against god and this is the good book don't ya know
[3:28:42] <Picosunloaded> forever
[3:28:46] <Louie_Salmon> The book is bound by your child's witch contract
[3:28:48] <dukenux> Book really means "Til DEATH tell us apart"
[3:28:48] <naoi0> This is a christian game
[3:28:49] <heart_ablaze> like, it wouldn't be nearly as bad if the parents showed some sort of remorse for trying to make their daughter cry. But they seem so eager and happy to do it is what makes it so fucked up
[3:28:49] <Pelodance> damn they actually skipped that
[3:28:50] <naoi0> No divorce
[3:28:51] <T_Sasquatch> i genuinely hope the morale is that they understand each other and still brak up
[3:28:52] <%gatorafan> I think we went past the point of questioning how right or wrong things are.
[3:28:53] <+glgzephyr> your marriage can NEVER END
[3:28:54] <+Jiggisnipe> divorce is wrong Woolie
[3:28:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> USE TIME
[3:28:56] <+Kitrane> YOH ARE CONNECTED FOR LIFE!! SO SAYS I DEMON BOOK
[3:28:58] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> the hidden subtitle is It Takes Two to be horrible monsters
[3:28:58] <+allups> Kids dont make it better
[3:28:59] <+glgzephyr> TILL DEATH DO YOU PART
[3:29:01] <+OblivionSword1> Not after you're married and had a kid apparently
[3:29:02] <dukenux> *tear
[3:29:03] <alroy900> fuck that, the kid is better with other parents
[3:29:03] <zanzibarian_hamster> Presumably their relationship isn't beyond repair, it's not like he's an alcoholic prostituting gambler or something, they just aren't connecting
[3:29:04] <+RealThiele> ZA
[3:29:05] <%HeroToxiko> gotta make sure the kid knows it's not their fault first
[3:29:12] <townzzzzz> woolie....
[3:29:15] <+Mrbaconator> 451
[3:29:15] <penitentpendant> Farenheit 451?
[3:29:16] <naoi0> I thought it was 451?
[3:29:18] <+ja07sj> 551?
[3:29:21] <dds333a> 451
[3:29:27] <dds333a> Ray Bradbury
[3:29:35] <naoi0> The temperature at which paper catches alight if memory serves correct
[3:29:35] <Darren716> It's 551 in celcius Kappa
[3:29:35] <+ja07sj> i mean I guess the book will burn at 451 or 551
[3:29:36] <%MajorCrasher> reverse time?
[3:29:39] <+Kitrane> Indigo Prophecy?
[3:29:45] <$Holycow8498> Why are we talking about book burning?
[3:29:49] <dukenux> it's okay Reggie, i only know Celsius anyway
[3:30:04] <naoi0> Because the 'antagonist' in this game is a relationship book
[3:30:04] <dds333a> Great book, by the way, although it took me a reread to really get it, especially the ending
[3:30:07] <%HeroToxiko> this area feels like Vexx
[3:30:15] <Sonny_Firestorm> It doesn't really matter if they break up or not, their daughter is already born and old enough to care.
[3:30:16] <+NickHatesSnow> it's more open
[3:30:32] <naoi0> How old is Rose?
[3:30:39] <NeroInfinite> eight
[3:30:47] <+Kitrane> Old enough for some serious trauma
[3:31:03] <Sonny_Firestorm> The moment you're not a baby anymore it's enough for them to miss either (or both) parents)
[3:31:04] <naoi0> Like your parents dragging your imaginary best friend to death as it struggles?
[3:31:12] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:31:19] <Saltmeisterr> ok are we just gonna ignore what we did to the elephant?
[3:31:23] <dds333a> Right, Cody
[3:31:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> Well Mr. Elephant ain't dead yet.
[3:31:41] <dds333a> No, that can't be right
[3:31:42] <+Kitrane> fuck. Life is Strange flashbqcks
[3:31:45] <Pelodance> it's just a toy don't worry
[3:31:47] <dukenux> i REALLY hope Cutie gets fixed by the time this game ends
[3:31:50] <%HeroToxiko> wait is this literally vexx and blinx at the same time
[3:31:56] <%X2Eliah> @Saltmeisterr Elephant dead don't worry about it
[3:31:56] <%lostcolors> divorce is strange
[3:32:09] <+Kitrane> Vexx was so fucking weird
[3:32:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1376753284791296000
[3:32:10] <+ja07sj> killing a baby elephant is a victimless crime, if you think about it
[3:32:14] <+FrostedZaibatsu> hggGalaxy hggGalaxy hggGalaxy
[3:32:17] <dds333a> I fear Cutie won't be featured again until maybe the very end
[3:32:19] <naoi0> The baby
[3:32:31] <dds333a> When we go over the entire cast
[3:32:35] <BlackermanZX> justice for cutie doodSad
[3:32:40] <alroy900> the dismembered baby elephant who beg for mercy as it was dragged and ripped apart
[3:32:42] <jorniev> it takes two to DIVORCE
[3:32:43] <naoi0> Cutie did noting wrong
[3:32:49] <%X2Eliah> Look AS LONG AS WE KILLED IT TOGETHER we are doing the God's work
[3:32:52] <+QueequegTheater> #CutieDidntKilHerself
[3:32:59] <@Menitta> this is like "in order to save your marriage, you must commit several crimes"
[3:33:02] <+glgzephyr> that's cursed, Quee
[3:33:08] <Sonny_Firestorm> #CutieWasAnInsideJob
[3:33:11] <naoi0> @Menitta Bonnie and Clyde-esque
[3:33:11] <+Jiggisnipe> the couple that kills together stays together
[3:33:12] <dds333a> @queequegtheater LUL
[3:33:35] <+ja07sj> remember when Poot and Bodie murdered Wallace together? these events bring people closer
[3:33:36] <jorniev> they broke the toy?
[3:33:40] <+Kitrane> Commiserated guilt and trauma is GREAT for struggling relationships
[3:33:45] <+glgzephyr> just kill the child so that the parents can divorce, guilt-free!
[3:34:01] <dds333a> Good People was about a struggling relationship that somewhat improved after some people died, although their issue was money
[3:34:04] <naoi0> @jorniev Througha series of events they shoved it off a ledge after having ripped off its leg and ear
[3:34:17] <KaiserMario> ...
[3:34:18] <jorniev> DARK
[3:34:26] <Sonny_Firestorm> @glgzephyr but then you get the guilt of filicide.
[3:34:31] <naoi0> All while it begged no and actively struggled
[3:34:32] <+glgzephyr> @jorniev They slowly murdered it. Glory kills in DOOM don't come close
[3:34:37] <Pelodance> LUL
[3:34:53] <alroy900> they then bathed and rejoiced in the tears of their child
[3:34:59] <naoi0> Literally
[3:35:02] <alroy900> and nothing happened
[3:35:05] <+glgzephyr> it was closer to a Punisher fatality
[3:35:07] <+Jiggisnipe> @jorniev it was. she was struggling and fighting as they dragged her to the edge to throw her off a cliff
[3:35:18] <+glgzephyr> and the voice acting, god
[3:35:18] <%jonblnt> zelda puzzle
[3:35:19] <dds333a> Literally Cutie and the majority of her kingdom were just massacred
[3:35:20] <+glgzephyr> poor Cutie
[3:35:35] <naoi0> She even offered cookies and a hug when they met
[3:35:40] <naoi0> And said they didn't have to bow
[3:35:48] <NeroInfinite> bird land
[3:35:50] <%Jaxnos> i'm amazed with how much is in this game
[3:35:51] <+RealThiele> old yharnnum

[3:36:06] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> cutie didn't deserve her fate
[3:36:08] <@Menitta> I think it all lies on the book.
[3:36:10] <+Aeoneth> Beetle, the Wasp colong, Squirrel Commander, that Clown Balloon, Cutie
[3:36:13] <+Jiggisnipe> wasps deserved it
[3:36:15] <BlackermanZX> fuck wasps anyways
[3:36:15] <@Menitta> This is all because of the book
[3:36:18] <dds333a> Hakim better bite it too
[3:36:24] <naoi0> Would you eat food if it was always screaming while you ate?

[4:41:33] <+glgzephyr> *looking at butterfly* Is this Cainhurst?
[4:41:33] <DSD24> Get that makeup on
[4:41:43] <@Menitta> AND I DONT WANNA TALK TO A SCIENTIST
[4:41:47] <DedlokPM> octoClown Magnets: How do they work
[4:41:48] <%WutangchickeN> oh my god this game's puzzle mechanics are brilliant
[4:41:51] <Solidnick18> !uptime
[4:41:52] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 51 minutes
[4:41:54] <+RyTYoung> SO DOPE
[4:41:55] <T_Sasquatch> electromagnetic waves baby
[4:41:56] <%jonblnt> just learned that recently
[4:41:57] <dds333a> CAUSE ALL THEIR ANSWERS KEEP
[4:42:01] <StebTheVee> Except in math
[4:42:06] <alexsumac> I wonder can the game beat clockwork setpiece?
[4:42:23] <dds333a> Thay clock was strong, might be the high point
[4:42:33] <+glgzephyr> space time is a little complex for kids.....
[4:42:34] <dinnydanny777> Opposites Attract
[4:42:35] <dds333a> I thought Rodent Warfare was, but nah
[4:42:37] <dukenux> What are the 4 main forces that hold this universe together again?
[4:42:40] <Equirah> they do if you give them enough access to science
[4:42:44] <alexsumac> @dds333a Yeah, aesthetically it was amazing.
[4:42:44] <sendart> Oh my god how many times are they going to say that same voice line
[4:42:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:42:54] <dukenux> gravity, electromagnetism, atom bonds...
[4:42:59] <%jonblnt> gg
[4:42:59] <NeroInfinite> Space time isn't somethign you can just teach kids woolie.
[4:43:00] <%Samura1_Queen19> Protons and electrons attract
[4:43:09] <Tracazoid> The game look stellar so far
[4:43:15] <dinnydanny777> A saw monkaS
[4:43:16] <Tracazoid> looks*
[4:43:16] <+glgzephyr> I'm going to guess that Woolie has never taught a child anything
[4:43:18] <Louie_Salmon> Oh hey they did this in brothers too
[4:43:22] <+Jiggisnipe> legitimate GOTY contender
[4:43:34] <T_Sasquatch> there is SO much in this game im amazed
[4:43:37] <Deko_> this is already like double the lenght of a way out too right?
[4:43:38] <%gatorafan> Yeah but this game is a few steps above.
[4:43:43] <Robot_Nixon_> fuck the oscars guy was right, the oscars suck
[4:43:47] <%BestTeaMaker> i wonder what speedruns of this game is like
[4:43:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Josef Fares knows how to make good videogame
[4:43:54] <Darren716> They know how to a specific genre extremely well
[4:43:55] <+QueequegTheater> DIVE KICKU
[4:43:59] <%BestTeaMaker> MAGNET JUMP
[4:44:01] <+Rekinsinn> Was it the Two Brothers team?
[4:44:02] <+NickHatesSnow> The master od 2p co-op
[4:44:06] <T_Sasquatch> speed runs of this game would ruin friendships LUL
[4:44:06] <TheEmperorsEyebrows> magnet jumping
[4:44:09] <+QueequegTheater> @Rekinsinn same devs
[4:44:11] <dukenux> Josef Fares got on my based devs list with this one for sure
[4:44:13] <dukenux> 3 outta 3
[4:44:22] <dds333a> Time to enter the Overlook
[4:44:40] <%Samura1_Queen19> Imagine if things get hot and heavy between May and Cody LUL The book is just watching on the sidelines LUL
[4:44:41] <T_Sasquatch> Brothers is worth playing, its better to play as one person
[4:44:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh boy i wanna see reggie and woolz do a way out
[4:44:49] <Deko_> itd be cool if you played the others on stream with reggie
[4:45:01] <+glgzephyr> yeah they'd be quick stream filler
[4:45:02] <Equirah> LUL
[4:45:06] <Darren716> I'd like to see Woolie try the ending of A Way Out with his new training
[4:45:08] <Louie_Salmon> Shitting is a good power
[4:45:09] <%gatorafan> @T_Sasquatch I don't think it'd quite work since Woolie already did it with Pat.
[4:45:11] <+Jiggisnipe> I forgot some of them
[4:45:14] <%Euphbugg> the answer is now shit
[4:45:22] <Equirah> i dodn't remember that power reggie LUL
[4:45:26] <%gatorafan> answered the wrong person, sorry
[4:45:38] <dds333a> Nail shooting pretty alright, but the Diablo like was my fav, probably
[4:45:39] <brachydios777> This game has a good amount of variety
[4:45:53] <dukenux> Yes
[4:46:00] <FatherGreyBeard> The Clock Tower was sick
[4:46:08] <+allups> nah i think its valid
[4:46:08] <dds333a> Yeah, that's true
[4:46:09] <%Samura1_Queen19> May repels, Cody attracts
[4:46:11] <dukenux> this game is a chocolate box of mechanics
[4:46:12] <Deko_> yeah timestop was really cool
[4:46:18] <+Jiggisnipe> The wasp battle was third person shooter
[4:46:24] <Equirah> @Samura1_Queen19 that's.... not how magnets work
[4:46:28] <dds333a> Oh, more clocks, THO
[4:46:29] <$arcielardor> what about the power of making children cry?
[4:46:37] <+QueequegTheater> @Samura1_Queen19 no
[4:46:41] <%livlinn> Noose OhMyDog
[4:46:42] <+glgzephyr> @Samura1_Queen19 You sure about that one?
[4:46:43] <+Jiggisnipe> nail and hammer and the clock were puzzle games
[4:46:54] <%kyh9> Josef Fares has come a long way. He's genuinely an auteur in my book now
[4:47:15] <Equirah> fucking "auteur"
[4:47:29] <%BestTeaMaker> hazelight honestly has been making some of the best setpiece games
[4:47:29] <+glgzephyr> note that auteur does not imply high quality products
[4:47:34] <+glgzephyr> it's just a directorial style
[4:47:54] <dukenux> the timestop moment was the coolest set piece so far
[4:47:56] <+glgzephyr> for example, David Cage is an auteur
[4:48:01] <+glgzephyr> but he makes za bad game
[4:48:08] <Equirah> david cage is an hack LUL
[4:48:32] <%jonblnt> auteur theory is bullshit
[4:48:38] <dukenux> And there's Kojima who's somehow BOTH
[4:48:46] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Kojima lol
[4:48:55] <+Jiggisnipe> hackuer
[4:48:57] <%gatorafan> God I just had this horrid image of this game having a Heavy Rain kind of ending...
[4:49:04] <brachydios777> Kojima is unique
[4:49:06] <%gatorafan> "Well our kid hates us... but we can make another one"
[4:49:17] <alexsumac> Kojima is good when he has people who filter his ideas
[4:49:54] <+glgzephyr> the term "auteur" has nothing to do with the quality of a product
[4:49:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:50:08] <+glgzephyr> it just means that the guy in charge basically wrote the thing, that's it
[4:50:20] <brachydios777> What genre would you guys like to see Kojima do next?
[4:50:30] <dukenux> dating sim
[4:50:30] <%gatorafan> RTS
