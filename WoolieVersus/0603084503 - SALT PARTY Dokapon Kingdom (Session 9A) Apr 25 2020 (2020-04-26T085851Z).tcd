[0:20:17] <C4m3r0n0409> OOOF
[0:20:18] <DaBigVitus> i tried watching the runawayguys play dokapon but it wasn't my thing at all. HAS to be these guys
[0:20:20] <InXplotch> How y'all holding up with the lockdown
[0:20:21] <+gutlesscoward> what would the crew's limit breaks be
[0:20:24] <%Hawkbone_> It might just be a screen that says "Reggie wins" and then the game ends
[0:20:27] <%MisterArcanine> Dokapon CBT
[0:20:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Or the kettle might stop whistling because all the water boiled out and then it will just slowly melt silently to the stove
[0:20:32] <%Amaideus> The runawayguys was fine, but it wasn't grimy enough
[0:20:36] <zenith0111> LUL Shiiiit
[0:20:41] <%Amaideus> This is the level of grime this genre deserves
[0:20:41] <%nothuzad> great stuff
[0:20:46] <%emperordread> We've seen Minh's Limit Break (Deafening roar) and Woolie's Limit Break (Breakdown) - what will Reggie's be?
[0:20:46] <+robobeau> the Dokapon version of you and the Daganronpa version of you are the same person
[0:20:47] <tokenreefer> Tease my nuts dokapon!
[0:20:48] <%Solidnick18> then someone might turn that car around
[0:20:50] <%GenesisKnight> So it's STeel Ball Run?
[0:20:55] <GMKGoat> tbh I wish this LP was grimier
[0:21:04] <%Solidnick18> omg

[0:25:48] <zenith0111> You binge that shit
[0:25:50] <Aydarkzero> i stopped at 3 b/c i couldn't get into it
[0:25:51] <%fuji_92> LUL
[0:25:51] <%GenesisKnight> That's cowardice
[0:25:52] <phatmac16> that defeats the whole purpose of the show
[0:25:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's actually insane
[0:26:04] <%fuji_92> KAMINA DIED? I'M OUT LUL
[0:26:04] <InXplotch> didnt people DO that though? With that one gurren laggan episode that had the weird artstyle
[0:26:07] <+Cn_alpha_02> I did that.
[0:26:09] <%rubbishbinge> I stopped when L died u_u
[0:26:15] <barucafe> I knew someone who dropped Code Geass at episode 48
[0:26:21] <+Grayhammatter> werk

[0:26:30] <EpitaphTransmits> @woolieversus I honestly wished Lucky Star kept going
[0:26:30] <%MisterArcanine> Honestly you’re good to stop there Rubbishbinge
[0:26:30] <%nintega010> @rubbishbinge that's understandable
[0:26:32] <%Amaideus> Doesn't Code Geass only have like 50 something episodes though?
[0:26:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> imagine stopping promare after they capture Lio
[0:26:36] <zenith0111> @barucafe What episode is that?
[0:26:41] <bipdipper> makes sense cause the 2nd season of code geass sucks
[0:26:42] <Jetsfantasy> This is the power of the Tandem Engine
[0:26:43] <+Grayhammatter> oh shit, the art of war AND dokapon
[0:26:51] <%MisterArcanine> Because Death Note has a terrible ending
[0:26:58] <%andrei11dr> All thought things with enormous length are very intimidating for me ,Gundam and One Piece were two big ones
[0:27:07] <+evbites> wtf
[0:27:07] <+robobeau> While you were fuckboi-inh, Minh was practicing THE ART OF WAR
[0:27:08] <%Jetzord> I never understood that
[0:27:11] <%Rhinoprotoss> Use it for fight games?
[0:27:16] <Daba_mk2> I'm gonna use this for fighting games
[0:27:24] <barucafe> @zenith0111 2 episodes before the end. IMO the part that made the show worth watching at all
[0:27:36] <%fuji_92> I'm gonna use to play dynasty warriors Kappa
[0:27:48] <%gunsrlove> He's sending a message
[0:27:48] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:27:57] <%emperordread> A lot of the art of war is common sense nowadays, it's been internalised into strategy so much that it's ubiquitous
[0:28:02] <%MisterArcanine> Minh is using the art of war in Dokapon right now
[0:28:06] <%Jetzord> I feel like a lot of the Art of War just feels like common sense
[0:28:08] <%EyeFarted> Reggie come in with the Kama Sutra
[0:28:12] <phatmac16> The anarchist cook book
[0:28:15] <+b_aleph> Bringing the Vade Mecum to the session
[0:28:16] <bipdipper> minh finna pull up with a behelit

[0:32:49] <%Irridium> Tekken is anime as fuck but the art-style is still more realistic compared to Guilty Gears' hard anime aesthetic
[0:32:50] <+tearfuldevil> @andrei11dr yes, but it doesn't look like it
[0:32:52] <mdkcde> Normies don't see Tekken as anime
[0:33:05] <mdkcde> because they're normies
[0:33:10] <lessthanhuman_tv> I wouldn't see guilty gear as the type of anime that would turn me off
