[0:06:25] <Superdandy96> Yeah, KOF had some
[0:06:29] <@Solidus_113> JoJo Eyes of Heaven has it doesn't it?
[0:06:30] <%RioGascar> the low amount makes them hype
[0:06:33] <0rond> the unique dramatic finishes are also great
[0:06:34] <thewhiterice92> Evo connection is trash for me at work but Woolie is rock solid so here I stay
[0:06:36] <%RioGascar> when they show up

[0:06:45] <+Aztec50> is there a summoning circle on the table?
[0:07:04] <0rond> I gotta say, these last 2 WWFIO made me a fan of punch mom for real
[0:07:04] <%ChoculaUltra> did KoF/Fatal Fury start the custom intro? I think the earliest one I can remember is Terry growling out "GEEEEESE" if he's ever up against Geese since like FF2?
[0:07:07] <%RioGascar> Ken and terrys intro is fucking awesome
[0:07:11] <%RioGascar> Even tho its short
[0:07:29] <Superdandy96> Damn it Spidey, get back to protecting New York, Shocker Robbed another bank!
[0:07:36] <0rond> a lot of what punch mom says resonates with me super hard

[0:12:50] <%RioGascar> i am intreged BUT
[0:12:56] <DonatelloJose> This isn't fiasco
[0:13:03] <atravelbee> what is the cat on Minhs chest from?
[0:13:03] <%RioGascar> how much is this game is the biggest factor in this
[0:13:09] <RaklarLS> oh yo, this looks cool "Dialect is a tabletop roleplaying game about an isolated community, their language, and what it means for that language to be lost"
[0:13:13] <Hammatime8> I thought that's what you guys already did as content creators? Kappa
[0:13:22] <RaklarLS> you make a language as it goes along
[0:13:23] <ghostravens> so this game was made by hideo kojima?
[0:13:25] <%The_Timo> Oooo, If you like this you'll enjoy microscope, which is a less structured type of this game
[0:13:30] <0rond> WORDS THAT KILL
[0:13:31] <%RioGascar> Like if its 100$ it better be fucking fun
[0:13:36] <BurdRightsActivist> Terraforming mars tonight? PogChamp

[0:13:50] <$SilverRoddo> Words hurt, and cause chip damage.
[0:13:51] <BurdRightsActivist> SKULL FACE: THE GAME
[0:13:55] <Superdandy96> Woolie must make his Latin!
[0:13:59] <RaklarLS> @RioGascar that's the problem with RPGs, if someone can't roleplay, it won't be fun
[0:14:01] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BurdRightsActivist
[0:14:03] <assfordayz> Lets see how french die by the year 3k
[0:14:06] <@Menitta> Thy lords of Tables

[0:14:10] <BurdRightsActivist> Words that kill, will you speak them to me
[0:14:21] <0rond> good thing woolie has experience with DA BEEBLE
[0:14:28] <worldbrand> This sounds like a bold start to the night, but I'm here for it
[0:14:31] <%RioGascar> so on the bordgames leaderboard complexity is like 4.5/5
[0:14:33] <Superdandy96> @raklarls I haven’t played a lot of D&D sessions, but how bad are the “Meta” players?
[0:14:34] <%phantom23001> phantom23001 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[0:14:54] <0rond> what the heck is this
[0:14:57] <+Kiaayo> this sounds like an austin walker-ass game
[0:15:01] <+Grayhammatter> dialect
[0:15:01] <ghostravens> so it WAS made by hideo kojima
[0:15:05] <zanderrage> he getting kdm painted

[0:15:23] <%RioGascar> 30$
[0:15:23] <0rond> A GENIUS KOJUMBO BOARD GAME
[0:15:25] <$theKittenhugs> KDM in-person would take over every Tablelords session for the next decade
[0:15:29] <@Menitta> Haha what
[0:15:30] <RaklarLS> @Superdandy96 havent played dnd, but playing other RPGs, players that only care about stats and getting to the goal do not want to engage with the DM and put themselves through a story, with conflict and resolution; they just want to win which is not the point
[0:15:31] <RC_S3kshun8> Game is called 'Dialect' going off book title?
[0:15:35] <%GinAndRoses> Vive le Quebec Libre!
[0:15:35] <worldbrand> i'm learning irish, i'm learning finnish, but i hated every minute of learning french

[0:17:08] <0rond> woolie out here making his friends feel uncomfortable
[0:17:10] <%RioGascar> This sounds like it can go south super fast
[0:17:10] <@akuda_bar> This is a space that is tolerant of Reggie

[0:39:07] <arkv01> hydrogen?
[0:39:19] <Azathotic> What game?
[0:39:22] <ChrisAlgoo> France also made Haiti pay reparations TO THEM which damaged their economy to this day
[0:39:24] <arkv01> dilithium?
[0:39:26] <+Arkfyre> burned down the cabane a sucre, no more maple syrup
[0:39:30] <Mothman742> @azathotic dialect
[0:40:01] <+BoboDaHobo> just got here, this game seems intense
[0:40:09] <worldbrand> HFCS
[0:40:19] <+gogorobotz> what are they palying?
[0:40:21] <+PapaGravestone> hey all. whats going on in the game? some kind of worldbuilding?
[0:40:29] <$theKittenhugs> the sugar must flow
[0:40:35] <Mothman742> so uh..... how exactly is this game played?
[0:40:36] <arkv01> no way guys, sugar is a TOXIN
[0:40:36] <+steelmorrigan> Yes World building
[0:40:41] <arkv01> stop drinking pop!
[0:40:53] <worldbrand> Dialect seems to be a game about worldbuilding, roleplaying, and the emphasis is on how languages die but we havent gotten there yet
[0:40:55] <+CoronetChris> The Spice must flooow!
[0:41:06] <+PapaGravestone> ooh cool
[0:41:08] <+steelmorrigan> this gonna be along ass game
[0:41:18] <ghostravens> He Who Controls The Spice, Controls The Universe
[0:41:18] <MildConviction> they said this'll likely last the whole session, so a 3-4 hour game.
[0:41:21] <+PapaGravestone> wonder if theyll ever play microscope
[0:41:27] <arkv01> I am hype for anthropomorphic roleplay aka yifffff
[0:41:32] <Mothman742> @worldbrand so dnd but more focused on languages?
[0:41:52] <%RioGascar> i mean spice trade made a fuck ton of money
[0:41:53] <AceOne5> woolieYE
[0:42:01] <%The_Timo> No, more like a more focused game of Microscope.
[0:42:07] <worldbrand> none of us really know how it works yet
[0:42:08] <%RioGascar> also helped that spices were exclusive to certain places
[0:42:10] <%The_Timo> Just a family get together story time
[0:42:17] <@akuda_bar> who's winning gdqClap
[0:42:41] <+PapaGravestone> @the_timo dont think many know about microscope for the comparison lol
[0:42:43] <worldbrand> they havent started yet but minh is definitely winning by at least 2
[0:42:57] <%The_Timo> This is just similar to methods of generating stories and worlds for some DMs lol
[0:43:14] <Mothman742> wow chat u guys werent helpful at all! its almost like u all havent ever played this game Kappa
[0:43:30] <%RioGascar> but its a group effort rather than DM doing it fully to build the start of the world
[0:43:37] <Xx_JAG_xX> yo, what's this game called?
[0:43:42] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[0:43:44] <Mothman742> dialect
[0:43:48] <ghostravens> the spice from dune but it's sugar instead
[0:43:51] <Xx_JAG_xX> thanks homies
[0:43:53] <+buttdirt> first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women
[0:44:03] <%RioGascar> also is this island ISOLATED
[0:44:03] <MildConviction> so it's cocaine
[0:44:05] <%The_Timo> Feels like could save a lot of people's time if he just put it in the title haha but people would still ask
[0:44:06] <+akira_chong> So what's this game called?
[0:44:10] <+PapaGravestone> but you can get sugar from the women tho
[0:44:13] <+fatcrab> Dont know whats going on but seems cool
[0:44:16] <+YabbaTroll> sugar, aw honey honey
[0:44:21] <%RioGascar> it feels like it would be a barter economy
[0:44:34] <%RioGascar> money happens when other countries get involved
[0:44:56] <%RioGascar> or banks begin to pop up
[0:44:58] <Mothman742> yo a mod should make a command for when people ask wat game they're playing
[0:45:01] <smartiger117> Seize the means of sugar production comrades
[0:45:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:45:20] <%RioGascar> people would still ask what game it is
[0:45:26] <+akira_chong> !schedule
[0:45:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[0:45:49] <+akira_chong> Oh, even in the schedule it just says "Tablelords."
[0:45:52] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Did you see the Samurai Shodown DLC?
[0:46:02] <Arblaster_> 天
[0:46:06] <Mattatat_tat> forreal tho what are they playing
[0:46:07] <%The_Timo> have you ever tried to make candy? Molten sugar FUCKING HURTS... pretty powerful weapon lol
[0:46:11] <+PapaGravestone> man i havent eaten an orange in forever. feels right.
[0:46:15] <%RioGascar> stockpiling sugar when isolated SOUNDS WORTHLESS
[0:46:16] <Mothman742> he aint lookin at chat bruh @kitsunemanami

[0:46:48] <zanderrage> then stop with sugar
[0:46:53] <%twilight_cleric> I think Robots is the way to go
[0:46:56] <MayorRev> wait civilization is NOT a board game?

[0:55:29] <$theKittenhugs> Death Stranding robots
[0:55:31] <worldbrand> Turned people into salt
[0:55:31] <%RioGascar> oh wait fuck all that
[0:55:35] <%RioGascar> i like woolies idea
[0:55:36] <+CoronetChris> Death Stranding
[0:55:40] <Mothman742> @akuda_bar well that kinda makes more sense
[0:55:53] <$theKittenhugs> no fuck you i don't poop
[0:55:56] <$theKittenhugs> I don't!!!! noooo
[0:55:57] <+BoboDaHobo> so far this game has just been woolie and steph talking while Reggie and Minh look back and forth like it's a tennis match
[0:56:01] <gsoto83> And they take any chance as any chance
[0:56:18] <Hellarussian> sounds like the Bubonic Plague
[0:56:36] <$Walopoh> The Mongols literally catapulted Bubonic-infected corpses into a sieged city, boats sailed in fear to Europe. And this began the Black Plague
[0:56:37] <$theKittenhugs> Reggie big on corpse disposal robot's job security
[0:56:40] <worldbrand> I had to step away, did they ditch the slavery thing?
[0:56:45] <@akuda_bar> that's so metal
[0:56:46] <+steelmorrigan> yes
[0:56:48] <Mothman742> @bobodahobo they look like two kids caught between their parents discussing LUL
[0:56:55] <worldbrand> gotcha
[0:56:57] <+Dr_Mooose> "but I'm still alive"
[0:56:59] <+BubbaRands> Can the robots wear plague masks?
[0:57:03] <gsoto83> Reggie is Big Corpse disposal lobby
[0:57:03] <+SlappyMeats> they bury the dead, and in order to do a better job, they must make more dead :D
[0:57:03] <+steelmorrigan> The Slave thing asked too manty borad quetsions
[0:57:05] <Prevot> they traded bio slavery for robo slavery
[0:57:11] <Azathotic> Sun O))))?
[0:57:12] <fuji_92> LUL
[0:57:16] <%The_Timo> must have been catastrophic. How long will this clean up take?
[0:57:22] <Arblaster_> Berry?
[0:57:29] <+Dr_Mooose> LUL
[0:57:30] <Hellarussian> mind games
[0:57:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @gsoto83
[0:57:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL LUL LUL
[0:57:35] <%RioGascar> i say we go with 50% of the planet died
[0:57:42] <%RioGascar> animals, humans etc
[0:57:57] <fuji_92> burry
[0:57:59] <%The_Timo> "ALMOST" bilingual apparently lol
[0:57:59] <gsoto83> tHAT DOESN"T ME SHES AN ENGLISH MAJOR!
[0:57:59] <$Walopoh> brry
[0:58:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sounds metal
[0:58:14] <Hellarussian> metal as fuck
[0:58:16] <+Dr_Mooose> that's metal
[0:58:18] <$Walopoh> kewl
[0:58:19] <gsoto83> Oh, You will know us by the trail of the dead, thats a good band
[0:58:21] <+BubbaRands> ok that is fuckin sick as fuck
[0:58:24] <Azathotic> Shockingly not a metal band though FeelsSadMan
[0:58:35] <%The_Timo> Urge to hump things
[0:58:38] <gsoto83> Surprise, they are not metal
[0:58:40] <%Irridium> big orgies
[0:58:42] <%RioGascar> idea: actual burial
[0:58:47] <%RioGascar> and cerimony
[0:58:48] <+MillerLowlife> reverance for the dead
[0:58:49] <Prevot> tombstones
[0:58:49] <worldbrand> You paint your robot fingernails
[0:58:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> You start wearing gothic lolita dresses
[0:59:00] <gsoto83> ^^^^
[0:59:02] <+SlappyMeats> Is this the setup of the game, or is this the game?
[0:59:10] <Superdandy96> Robots understand the need to show off their butts?
[0:59:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:59:15] <Mothman742> Yes
[0:59:16] <%The_Timo> Maybe the humans were fairly religious so each burial has to be done in a full funeral
[0:59:19] <+MisterCrimson> So...we're just building Nier
[0:59:27] <Sedrelic> we are...vr
[0:59:31] <Prevot> they show humanity by wanting to **** 2B
[0:59:32] <%RioGascar> a robot would eventually begin to see the corpses as something else
[0:59:33] <+PenmanLupine> why was I programmed to feel pain?!
[0:59:38] <worldbrand> You learned how to raise the dead
[0:59:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> "We have our job, but what if we were also insanely attractive?"
[0:59:47] <JoeyStar> what game is this?
[0:59:49] <Mothman742> @prevot u would too
[0:59:49] <gusdabus91> isn't there an anime like this?
[1:00:07] <10deez> @JoeyStar Upper right corner
[1:00:12] <Sedrelic> isnt that just normal megaman
[1:00:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Grow fingers?
[1:00:14] <$theKittenhugs> Give us sexy corpse disposal robots
[1:00:15] <ItYaboiDrew> what they playing?
[1:00:16] <%The_Timo> Oh you mean like an AI? LOL
[1:00:18] <%RioGascar> the ability to gain empathy
[1:00:20] <$theKittenhugs> give the people what they want
[1:00:22] <+desfore> I just showed up, is he explaining Megaman?
[1:00:23] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[1:00:24] <10deez> @ItYaboiDrew Upper right corner
[1:00:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ItYaboiDrew Dialect
[1:00:32] <ItYaboiDrew> oh ok thanks
[1:00:35] <%RioGascar> burying corpses IS A BRUTAL FUCKIGN job
[1:00:43] <JoeyStar> @10deez thanks didn’t notice
[1:00:52] <Lamedhos> Adapt, improvised, overcome
[1:00:53] <%RioGascar> so i think the robot would maybe start empathizing with the corpses they bury
[1:01:01] <%RioGascar> maybe try and learn about their past
[1:01:05] <Sedrelic> 1 emotion: FEAR
[1:01:10] <%The_Timo> Lol just describing A.I.
[1:01:17] <%The_Timo> Curiousity would be more interesting
[1:01:29] <worldbrand> you have the ability to feel +1 and -1
[1:01:33] <%The_Timo> the ability to get distracted
[1:01:39] <Mothman742> All these ideas have been done before haven't they?
[1:01:53] <%RioGascar> i mean the ability to feel empathy is just terminator 2
[1:01:55] <$theKittenhugs> All the robots grow addicted to gacha games
[1:01:59] <%RioGascar> i know now why you cry
[1:02:06] <HijiriBee> Don't mind me, just here to escape the Leroy 7 GF NotLikeThis
[1:02:11] <awzie420> is there no more super best friends?
[1:02:21] <Sedrelic> weed-powered robots
[1:02:22] <$theKittenhugs> where you been for the last year

[1:03:24] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> cursed question
[1:03:50] <%RioGascar> maybe try and find out what happened? what was this virus? what was the origin? maybe go to case zero?
[1:03:51] <+MisterCrimson> developing rudimentary tribalism
[1:03:51] <awzie420> why what happened?? ive been in kuwait serving in the military what happen??
[1:04:00] <Mothman742> I'm thirsting for booty Kreygasm
[1:04:01] <worldbrand> What if they evolved superstition
[1:04:02] <+PenmanLupine> oh boy
[1:04:05] <%The_Timo> Lol.... oh no
[1:04:06] <+BubbaRands> Now this is just an episode of black mirror
[1:04:21] <%Exiliator> Does it have to serve a purpose?
[1:04:25] <Sedrelic> PrideGive FEAR team
[1:04:31] <+PapaGravestone> matt and pat had a falling out and arent friends anymore @awzie420
[1:04:34] <Lamedhos> Do robots dream of electric sheep
[1:04:48] <%The_Timo> @awzie420 Time to do some research. You got a painful video to watch
[1:04:53] <+tuchpi> DEATH STRANDING?
[1:04:55] <+SlappyMeats> that makes sense
[1:04:57] <awzie420> WHAAAAA!!! @PapaGravestone
[1:05:05] <awzie420> no way!!
[1:05:15] <+PapaGravestone> i know man. it hit everyone hard
[1:05:20] <Mothman742> Bruh u late to this news
[1:05:25] <awzie420> damm that sux
[1:05:29] <+BubbaRands> @Lamedhos no because why would you dream of sheep when you can dream of sick robo burials?!
[1:05:32] <%RioGascar> its been a full year since then
[1:05:46] <%RioGascar> sucks but they seem happier
[1:06:05] <Mothman742> When's the anniversary tho?
[1:06:07] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> henlo
[1:06:08] <%The_Timo> Humanity was perverted.... but they could not imagine the true perversion of A.I.
[1:06:24] <awzie420> man sorry to bring it up i was just out of the loop for awhile just catching up with everything
[1:06:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[1:06:26] <goose_attack_almanac> Dialect?
[1:07:16] <worldbrand> have any of yall read 17776?
[1:07:21] <+PapaGravestone> @awzie420 its ok man. if youre out of the loop you cant help it
[1:07:22] <%The_Timo> Every Robot for whatever reason decided to give themselves devil horns
[1:07:33] <%The_Timo> and pitch forks
[1:07:37] <arkv01> AI's seen too many tags... it needs somr real sick shit to get its jollies
[1:07:44] <ghoulspan> man look at the fupa
[1:08:17] <+Arkfyre> Some robots want to bury the humans before they die, to avoid the spread of disease MrDestructoid
[1:08:36] <%The_Timo> Have to replace and trade parts with each other for different daily tasks! Maybe sometimes you get attached to certain parts.
[1:08:37] <atravelbee> FU-pa

[1:09:14] <Lamedhos> Robot Hierarchy
[1:09:53] <Mothman742> @forevern2dust OK but why shouldn't we put doom in everything
[1:10:39] <worldbrand> the year is 2142 and they have figured out how to play doom on a pig
[1:10:54] <+Dr_Mooose> vore the bodies
[1:10:54] <Lamedhos> Consume Flesh
[1:10:55] <Mothman742> Amazing
[1:11:05] <Hellarussian> the Vore
[1:11:13] <worldbrand> vorebots huh
[1:11:14] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> what are they playing?
[1:11:19] <+BubbaRands> The remains are fuel
[1:11:20] <worldbrand> Dialect
[1:11:22] <+steelmorrigan> top right corner
[1:11:24] <+Arkfyre> c o n s u m e

[1:11:34] <+PapaGravestone> stylist
[1:11:39] <Sedrelic> Robo Necro-Vore
[1:11:41] <+SlappyMeats> they take them to a processing facility to generate fuel
[1:11:46] <agadejobi> Will Reggie have his soul stolen in this game as well?
[1:12:05] <+akira_chong> @awzie420 Woolie and Pat still do the weekly podcast under the name Castle Super Beast, though.
[1:12:08] <Mothman742> I see some vore "enthusiasts" are in chat.... shotoEww
[1:12:09] <ghostravens> well this got dark
[1:12:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Humans being the morons we are, build robots who need to eat humans to survive. Makes sense, we are morons.
[1:12:45] <Sedrelic> i find it funny, but i cant watch it for more than 5 seconds
[1:12:53] <+SlappyMeats> Corpse-powered robots. Yeah, let's just kick up the turbo on that murderbot revolution
[1:12:56] <MildConviction> we're inventing fossil fuels again, but now they still have some meat on them
[1:13:00] <+BubbaRands> If human corpses are fuel what's stopping them from taking out the middle man and just killing people?
[1:13:10] <%The_Timo> Humans aren't on earth anymore
[1:13:13] <+SlappyMeats> Indentured?
[1:13:14] <+MillerLowlife> raison d'etre?
[1:13:27] <gusdabus91> what about the robot suicide epidemic
[1:13:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:13:32] <+PenmanLupine> @BubbaRands I think its assumed that all humans are dead and their corpses litter the earth
[1:13:41] <%The_Timo> That was in the beginning, Humans left earth and had A.I. Clean up whatever was left
[1:13:53] <Sedrelic> why only humans,,, why not eat dogs or something then
[1:13:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @The_Timo I assume we want to go back at some point. Or else, why have the robots dispose of the dead at all.
[1:14:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> But if that's the case, wouldn't they run out of energy in like, 80 years? All humans are dead, hence they are all decomposing fast.
[1:14:30] <+PenmanLupine> @CappuccinoGuil not unless the earth is super cold now
[1:14:32] <+steelmorrigan> At leats that wasthe asusmtion when the robots ere programmed
[1:14:46] <Hellarussian> now wot
[1:14:46] <%The_Timo> Lol oh for sure, but if we knew the dead would fuel them, we'd know how long it would take them before they're all gone @Engwithan_Elder_God
[1:14:48] <+steelmorrigan> we know the humans are gone
[1:14:51] <+BubbaRands> THat's my question!!!
[1:15:00] <+SlappyMeats> Gosh, what happens when they run out of corpses?
[1:15:03] <Mothman742> Not gonna lie..... IMO this game seems kinda lame
[1:15:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PenmanLupine Even so, it'd have to be so cold, no life can live there anymore.
[1:15:09] <+SlappyMeats> HMMM
[1:15:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @The_Timo True. Just wait them out.
[1:15:22] <+PenmanLupine> @CappuccinoGuil which is fine for a world of just machines
[1:15:23] <+steelmorrigan> "This gaeme is about languages and how the ydie"
[1:15:31] <+steelmorrigan> I wonder what will happen :p
[1:15:33] <%Irridium> blurst
[1:15:38] <MaxXtreme23> Which game is this?
[1:15:40] <Hellarussian> cressed
[1:15:45] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[1:15:47] <worldbrand> I can definitely see this not being a game for everyboidy
[1:15:48] <+Arkfyre> blursed
[1:15:48] <+BubbaRands> Do the robots resort to making MORE corpses one the eventual humans come back to taking their land?!
[1:15:48] <+SlappyMeats> yo what's on that pizza?
[1:16:07] <+SlappyMeats> 100% guaranteed @BubbaRands
[1:16:14] <Hellarussian> anchovies hopefully
[1:17:02] <Mothman742> But isn't it inhabited by the robots??
[1:17:06] <+Dr_Mooose> green or red earth
[1:17:07] <Superdandy96> Probably ham and pineapple since that’s a Canadian invention
[1:17:07] <%The_Timo> Big Purple fuzz has grown over EVERYTHING
[1:17:09] <ghostravens> nier automata city i imagine
[1:17:19] <+BubbaRands> Lots of overgrowth
[1:17:30] <%Itselguapo> Overgrowth, yup we nier automata
[1:17:45] <worldbrand> rats, rats, we're the rats
[1:18:02] <@Solidus_113> Florida has sunk
[1:18:08] <Mothman742> I'm the big rat who makes all of da rulez
[1:18:09] <Sedrelic> jermaChomp

[1:18:54] <Mothman742> Crab rave 🦀 Florida's Gone 🦀
[1:18:54] <+Arkfyre> perhaps there's a giant rat, that make most, if not all of the rules
[1:19:17] <%Itselguapo> Really small rats don't follow the rules
[1:19:33] <worldbrand> did they burn the dead?
[1:19:45] <+CarlosEoM> thats metal
[1:19:48] <Mothman742> No cause the bits eat them
[1:19:55] <Mothman742> Bots
[1:20:00] <+akira_chong> Yeah that's super metal
[1:20:04] <worldbrand> i meant the mongolians lol
[1:20:10] <+akira_chong> yeah
[1:20:11] <+SlappyMeats> it's ok, he made up for it with all of the babies he fucked into existence :)
[1:20:14] <Superdandy96> That and he screwed like a rabbit, there’s a little khan in all of us!
[1:20:14] <Mothman742> Oh LUL
[1:20:25] <ghostravens> ngl, i'm enjoying this worldbuilding process
[1:20:27] <%The_Timo> OOo refining them down into their most basic elements ? lol
[1:20:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:20:30] <+BubbaRands> Human gases LUL
[1:21:03] <Hellarussian> humans got cancelled by bacteria?
[1:21:21] <Mothman742> #humansareoverparty
[1:22:01] <+nintega010> this is pretty much horizon zero dawn story
[1:22:02] <ghostravens> humans are cancelled. stan the plague
[1:22:52] <Mothman742> So bacteria are just kpop stans? Makes sense
[1:23:01] <Huntercd> Is that Woolie's wife?
[1:23:01] <Sedrelic> how many robots exists? are we talking millions or just hundreds
[1:23:11] <Arblaster_> Did the plague turn everyone into salt by chance? LUL
[1:23:28] <+SlappyMeats> depalpitated

[1:23:37] <@Menitta> Good job.

[1:24:10] <%Itselguapo> Soooo how does this game work?
[1:24:12] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[1:24:12] <Prevot> old world
[1:24:19] <Superdandy96> And even when humans kick the bucket, Plague will still exist
[1:24:21] <%The_Timo> Maybe most of NA is what actually evacuated
[1:24:24] <kuningaz45> so what the fuck game are they playing
[1:24:34] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[1:24:39] <%RioGascar> it would be planetart evac
[1:24:47] <Mothman742> @menitta u just missed the guy who was selling ur feet pics for cheep Kappa

[1:25:22] <worldbrand> genghisbots
[1:25:32] <+SlappyMeats> ah, continuing the Kahn tradition
[1:25:43] <worldbrand> oh okay interesting
[1:25:55] <shubachi> wait what are they playing?
[1:25:59] <+BubbaRands> This corpse is claimed SwiftRage

[1:26:37] <@Menitta> 410 billion
[1:26:41] <AmericanaRed> apatBougie A BILLION PATRONS
[1:26:46] <worldbrand> What about #The1300VoreRobots
[1:26:50] <Mothman742> All GAZILLION HUMANS DEAD
[1:26:51] <%RioGascar> arent we at like 7 billion people on earth currently
[1:27:02] <MelBrooksKA> ye
[1:27:04] <Alzero83> What is this game?
[1:27:10] <Alzero83> I came in without context
[1:27:16] <MildConviction> 100,000 robots looking for human corpses to use as fuel PogChamp
[1:27:23] <%RioGascar> the population metrics would probably ge thrown off
[1:27:24] <worldbrand> This game is supposed to be a roleplaying game about worldbuilding, particularly about languages and how they die
[1:27:26] <+steelmorrigan> dialect : a game about lanaguage and how it dies
[1:27:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Tibet might be more central.

[1:30:22] <+DrPoxx> Co-op?
[1:30:24] <trianglehat> language = dead
[1:30:25] <+steelmorrigan> yes
[1:30:29] <worldbrand> it is about roleplaying and worldbuilding and languages and how they die
[1:30:32] <AmericanaRed> robot juice
[1:30:33] <Bailey__gaming> oh yeah derp
[1:30:33] <Mothman742> THEY ARE PLAYING DIALECT
[1:30:47] <Sedrelic> benevolence is an emotion, not emotion
[1:30:47] <AmericanaRed> MrDestructoid SHARE THE ROBOT JUICE
[1:30:49] <Hellarussian> right, but what game is this?
[1:30:52] <worldbrand> they havent really gotten to the language bit yet though
[1:30:57] <neet98> oh the death stranding scenario
[1:31:01] <yficaptions> the game shows at the top right corner
[1:31:04] <worldbrand> Oh this is uno 3, the sequel to uno 2 (not related to uno though)
[1:31:10] <SumKnowBuddy> didnt they discuss how they shoudlnt make different classes earlier?
[1:31:13] <AmericanaRed> FEMALE ONLY ROBOTS
[1:31:21] <%RioGascar> they restarted

[1:33:03] <+steelmorrigan> Minh making it all about Capitalism
[1:33:06] <+SlappyMeats> simply a programmed directive
[1:33:13] <RC_S3kshun8> Yeah Machines would be very binary. Is the benefit to rescue more advantageous than the fuel expended? etc
[1:33:17] <neet98> death stranding
[1:33:17] <+steelmorrigan> In a society that wouldn;t have it.
[1:33:20] <%RioGascar> a robot would weigh the pros and cons
[1:33:25] <Mothman742> Whoever reads this has smol op energy Kappa
[1:33:26] <%RioGascar> and then decide if its worth it
[1:33:32] <+steelmorrigan> Central decides
[1:34:00] <%RioGascar> calculate the risks and if they outweigh the benefits its good to do

[1:44:13] <worldbrand> I dont exactly agree but it definitely works
[1:44:14] <+SlappyMeats> though I do feel like the death aspect is being leaned on more than the cleaning and recycling
[1:44:16] <Arblaster_> Do they have finger snapping features?
[1:44:20] <Mothman742> So how much longer till they ACTUALLY start the game?

[1:45:06] <MildConviction> it only took 2 hours of setup, but we're starting PogChamp
[1:45:07] <+SlappyMeats> these robots are the antithesis of rot and decay, they rejuvenate and purify
[1:45:11] <%wolfofsound> I love class systems Kappa
[1:45:15] <Bailey__gaming> Thanodes is strong cause it can work as all one word, or tha nodes if you wanna be street
[1:45:30] <%Lion_kun> MINH, PLAY YOUR TRAP CARD

[1:49:37] <+SlappyMeats> did we ever establish the appearance of these robots? Are they humanoid or like a bunch of roombas?

[2:16:19] <%wydamn> @Prevot LULZ
[2:16:39] <%wolfofsound> @Prevot no that's one piece
[2:16:41] <MelBrooksKA> Programming languages are for humans, not the machines @worldbrand
[2:16:46] <gsoto83> Yeah but programming language isn't really language, its more like building materials and instructions. Like, do you have to actively think about breathing?
[2:17:06] <MelBrooksKA> I am now
[2:17:14] <worldbrand> yeah that's more than fair

[2:17:24] <%Itselguapo> The robots in this world all speak in Regigigas, Regice, and all that so they speak in wubs and computer noises
[2:17:25] <%Irridium> I was born in a small village. I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers. Foreign soldiers. Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language. With each new post, my masters changed along with the words they made me speak. With each change, I changed, too. My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong. Words can kill.

[2:19:53] <gsoto83> Fuck @RealThiele I've never heard the sound of printing money, BUT THATS GOTTA BE IT
[2:21:36] <worldbrand> it seems pretty immediate that the game explores language as an expression of culture rather than a set of rules used to communicate
[2:22:17] <gsoto83> yeah, its actual language birth
[2:23:19] <Sedrelic> is there a winning condition?
[2:23:44] <worldbrand> probably not, but it sounds like there is an end
[2:23:55] <ghostravens> no, it's more of a roleplaying experience than a competitive thing
[2:23:57] <CazadorDeWulf> Hate to be that guy, but when's NUNS 4?

[2:25:53] <Sedrelic> can we call the corpse fuel "soul"

[2:30:59] <lionclaw12> now what if i cant read?
[2:31:03] <+Arkfyre> mobile form and blender form
[2:31:21] <+SlappyMeats> it could be a situation where you have some sort of compound you apply to the bodies to process it in a rudimentary form
[2:31:26] <+jiggy_snipe> processing would be ok I guess

[2:34:42] <gsoto83> Let the acid flash back wash over you @worldbrand
[2:34:52] <MelBrooksKA> Remember when kids were surfing the web
[2:35:09] <%Irridium> the internet is a series of tubes
[2:35:11] <%wolfofsound> remember when you could download ram
[2:35:15] <MelBrooksKA> I don't, that terminology was stupid
[2:35:27] <@akuda_bar> Looking back, I told way more people than I ever should have that I was a 12 year old girl perusing the internet LMAO
[2:35:33] <Prevot> what
[2:35:33] <gsoto83> @MelBrooksKA I was surfing for some of that sweet cyberporn on a 56k modem! God. I think I was 14?
[2:35:46] <@akuda_bar> because it was true, that's not an RP joke
[2:35:59] <%The_Timo> lol
[2:36:05] <%wolfofsound> @akuda_bar I'm glad you're still around to tell the tale, that's some scary shit in retrospect

[2:36:46] <%xpakeo> xpakeo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Keep being you Mr. Woolzez
[2:36:51] <Matrixvingian> The level of intense focus these guys are willing to put into this.
[2:36:53] <%The_Timo> @akuda_bar should be the other way round lol
[2:36:56] <%Irridium> I'm "GET OFF THE AOL I'M WAITING FOR A CALL"
[2:37:00] <+SlappyMeats> I mean just telling somebody you're a 12 year old girl doesn't mean they're gonna come get you, it's not like you're giving out your home address and class schedule
[2:37:10] <%Irridium> I was on the AOL.
[2:37:24] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie is gonna sacrifice all of them for the one purpose
[2:37:27] <@akuda_bar> yeah but you'd think i would've received a lot more dick pics
[2:37:27] <Matrixvingian> Anyone mind giving me the spoonfed rundown on what they're playing?

[2:37:38] <worldbrand> only reggie can save humanit- er, robotkind
[2:37:50] <MelBrooksKA> @akuda_bar I remember taking great pains to conceal being a minor when I was first using the web and every time I'd bring a friend on they'd "we're like 12 years old and live in tucson arizona!"
[2:37:57] <gsoto83> Can he World? can he really?
[2:37:58] <jazzygrooves> basically theyre roleplaying and living through the life and death of a language while also telling a story. I think
[2:37:59] <%K2YP70C0CK> getting free internet from netzero

[2:42:34] <+jiggy_snipe> it is a malfunction
[2:42:35] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Reggie all about that prime directive

[2:43:09] <Matrixvingian> Robo Kayfabe
[2:43:11] <%RioGascar> going DEV sounds fucking menancing
[2:43:17] <Matrixvingian> Silicon inside baseball.
[2:43:23] <@akuda_bar> reggie missed his true calling as an evil robot overlord
[2:43:26] <MelBrooksKA> I'm a dev
[2:43:26] <Matrixvingian> We are watching lore in the making.
[2:43:26] <%RioGascar> this was SLOW start
[2:43:27] <gsoto83> Goding dev sounds like something from reboot
[2:43:30] <Superdandy96> I like it
[2:43:31] <%RioGascar> like really slow start
[2:43:35] <trianglehat> OmegAlpha, save us from the DEVil
[2:43:37] <%RioGascar> but man it got good
[2:43:42] <worldbrand> I wonder how this language dies
[2:43:44] <Matrixvingian> I'm fine with the slow burn. This is an intimate beginning.
[2:43:45] <%wolfofsound> if reggie ever expresses interest in getting turned into AI please kill him
[2:43:47] <MelBrooksKA> I like it
[2:43:48] <worldbrand> because we could keep using it forever
[2:43:49] <gsoto83> Yeah, cause its actual world building
[2:43:50] <coracor> going dev, going to work for EA...
[2:44:03] <Matrixvingian> I'm willing to chill. Everyone has time to think instead of being charactures to entertain us.
[2:44:16] <gsoto83> EA is like the digital salt mines
[2:44:19] <Matrixvingian> 2human4stream
[2:44:30] <+SlappyMeats> I'm not convinced this game is about creating language, at least not anything new, when every created word pretty much just amounts to slang rooted in already-known jargon
[2:44:31] <%RioGascar> i feel like reggies character would always be in the conversation
[2:44:32] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie should communicate with himself
[2:44:33] <Matrixvingian> TenCent challenger appears!
[2:44:36] <MelBrooksKA> What are the pachinko mines?
[2:44:39] <gsoto83> Detroit too human, 3 fragment

[2:46:00] <%RioGascar> ^^^^^^^^
[2:46:03] <+Dr_Mooose> time to undermine the OmegaAdmin

[2:46:24] <Prevot> this conversation is behind 7 proxies
[2:46:29] <gsoto83> what???
[2:46:33] <%RioGascar> @WoolieVersus idea HTTPS is the only one that can connect privately cause hes SECURE he is seperate from OA
[2:46:38] <gsoto83> Reggie will remember this
[2:46:39] <MelBrooksKA> Are the dotted circles part of the board game or the table?
[2:46:48] <gsoto83> OmegaAdMin remembers all

[2:47:21] <%RioGascar> oh i dig that
[2:47:22] <gsoto83> lol
[2:47:26] <worldbrand> I think the circles are part of the game, delineating the ages and which words exist in which age?
[2:47:34] <%king_wragles> Weird, anyone know why Twitch kept saying I was posting too much?
[2:47:41] <%wolfofsound> oh no, he needs to be wiped
[2:47:47] <suikudo> Whats going on?

[2:51:49] <gsoto83> Instead of Carbon footprint, calorie footprint?

[2:55:30] <%wolfofsound> top side of the table is gonna fuck over the bottom half calling it
[2:55:32] <+Arkfyre> going for sort of a robo-abathur?
[2:55:38] <Prevot> MrDestructoid
[2:55:43] <MelBrooksKA> @RioGascar needs more back doors
[2:55:47] <Matrixvingian> Getting real Engine Heart vibes from this. Wuh woh Row Row fight the Process!
[2:55:47] <+SlappyMeats> Woolie is my spirit robot
[2:55:58] <%wolfofsound> @Arkfyre fuck I would love abathur in a borg type setting
[2:56:07] <Matrixvingian> He's using "I" verses the collective Process.

[2:56:23] <Matrixvingian> BILL-PYRE-COM
[2:56:25] <%RioGascar> @MelBrooksKA disagree, the OA has no backdoors. what it doesnt like is outside connections. it wants to CONNECT TO ALL. BECOME WE NOT BE YOU
[2:56:25] <Prevot> none of the other robots talk like that, Minh chooses to sound like a robot
[2:56:30] <Matrixvingian> REGCOM
[2:56:32] <jazzygrooves> LUL i still cant stop laughing at that name
[2:56:33] <gsoto83> More librarys than any nod

[2:56:43] <+SlappyMeats> BEEP BOOP I AM A MAGICIAN
[2:56:46] <@Solidus_113> Minh is losing packets

[2:57:00] <+ausl0> Woolie gonna get reported to OA soon
[2:57:01] <SumKnowBuddy> i'd like to think that the manipulator chooses to talk like that to sound smart
[2:57:02] <%king_wragles> Do NOT disrespect the Dead Master!
[2:57:07] <%K2YP70C0CK> doodTess
[2:57:07] <+TruSanKyuu> D:
[2:57:11] <gsoto83> Master of the dead!
[2:57:12] <Matrixvingian> MINH-GEN's gonna debug you so hard!
[2:57:21] <%Itselguapo> Woolie going True Neutral/Chaotic Neutral
[2:57:21] <gsoto83> And Minh goes to snitch
[2:57:22] <Matrixvingian> Prepare your I/O port.
[2:57:30] <$JobbedBone> that azumanga hoodie is great
[2:57:38] <%RioGascar> IF YOU GO DEV
[2:57:41] <+SlappyMeats> Robots are clearly showing a strong sense of irony already to call the most robotic character the Magician
[2:57:42] <%RioGascar> YOU GET DEBUGGED
[2:57:46] <gsoto83> Chaotic neutral, minh is lawful neutral
[2:58:18] <%alpacapologist> @croxeye i wasn't here to say it but thank you for the gift sub wooliePOYO
[2:58:35] <%RioGascar> @SlappyMeats minhs character can make use of the dead corpses in some magic way
[2:58:42] <%Itselguapo> This makes me want to see Woolie do D&D shit
[2:58:43] <%RioGascar> therefore magician
[2:58:47] <+SlappyMeats> no I know the justification
[2:58:52] <gsoto83> Reggie is like "tell me all your dirty little secrets"

[2:59:03] <FaderPotater> whats the game?
[2:59:13] <%RioGascar> the database being OA
[2:59:49] <%RioGascar> this really makes me wanna just particapate in this

[2:59:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Dialect
[3:00:09] <Matrixvingian> What if Minh could Nanomagic corpses to the recycling pyres?
[3:00:13] <Prevot> lewd
[3:00:16] <+ausl0> "you've been selected for a random search" - Reggie
[3:00:23] <trianglehat> can the log memory overfill? potentially lose / hide some history
[3:00:47] <+FloorBurger> Obituary
[3:01:00] <@akuda_bar> woolieREGGIEFUL Edit
[3:01:07] <%king_wragles> That.... that kinda sounds like asking if someone is doing the five finger shuffle
[3:01:08] <Matrixvingian> I do like Obit since these bots are caretakers of Mankind's ruin.
[3:01:08] <gsoto83> OA pulls up the terminal and runs /ls-cache/ find *.dev
[3:01:09] <%RioGascar> ah it works in multiple angles
[3:01:35] <gsoto83> PS, I'm loving this mic set up
[3:01:35] <BurdRightsActivist> WORDS THAT KILL
[3:01:39] <trianglehat> Reggie stealing the show
[3:01:52] <@Solidus_113> The Reg knows all
[3:01:56] <%king_wragles> You can't steal the show if you ARE the show
[3:01:59] <%RioGascar> i can already feel reggie is the overlord and woolies HTTPS wants to be on his own SECURE line
[3:02:01] <%king_wragles> foreheadguy.jpg
[3:02:02] <gsoto83> The Reg sees all
[3:02:11] <trianglehat> Reg is all
[3:02:17] <%RioGascar> reg is in any conversation that is not SECURE
[3:02:22] <gsoto83> Look, sometimes people just want a secure line
[3:02:33] <@Solidus_113> Reg knows you used a VPN
[3:02:42] <gsoto83> Encryption is a right to all mecha
[3:02:44] <+FloorBurger> We need a Regulator.
[3:02:53] <+jiggy_snipe> @RioGascar are Woolie's connections secure by default?
[3:02:59] <gsoto83> Reg knows you spoofed your IP address
[3:03:02] <%RioGascar> i would say yes
[3:03:06] <%RioGascar> cause HTTPS
[3:03:10] <eyezehuhh> I came to the stream extra late and this sounds like a terrace house conversation!
[3:03:11] <+ausl0> Reggie is omnipresent
[3:03:21] <%king_wragles> Register Reggie at reggiereg . registration . com
[3:03:26] <Sedrelic> an hologram
[3:03:29] <%RioGascar> i would also say HTTPS is the only one that can communicate outside of OA's network
[3:03:34] <%RioGascar> and he doesnt like that
[3:04:23] <+steelmorrigan> Minh just strihgt up going to sell everone out
[3:04:55] <Prevot> oh god more MrDestructoid talk
[3:04:58] <trianglehat> robocall
[3:05:00] <%K2YP70C0CK> doodJJ doodJJ
[3:05:11] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh you snitch
[3:05:15] <+ausl0> snitching FeelsBadMan
[3:05:16] <gsoto83> Reggie is the linux server, but not a good one like red hat, hes like the chinese spy bot linux, DeepOne
[3:05:32] <MelBrooksKA> !snitch
[3:05:33] <waffleandman> the plot thickens
[3:05:33] <+Dr_Mooose> snitch bot
[3:05:35] <+SlappyMeats> Magiches get stitches
[3:05:38] <%RioGascar> time for HTTPS to just set up shop in australia
[3:05:40] <%RioGascar> alone
[3:05:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> This is a co-op game. Minh IMMEDIATELY snitching and betraying the group. Classic.
[3:06:00] <gsoto83> Classic Minh
[3:06:03] <%RioGascar> thats every coop game
[3:06:17] <%Itselguapo> Lawful evil Reggie incoming!
[3:06:24] <SheefEatsBeef> the rogue https
[3:06:26] <Balr0g_> 🤔
[3:06:26] <%RioGascar> also minh might still be salty at last table lords
[3:06:28] <+jiggy_snipe> all his communications are private to OA too
[3:06:38] <Matrixvingian> I like to think the Magician Integration Neural Holistics COM's verbal tics work in game as well. It's doing such esoteric processes that the vocoder is a bottom priority.
[3:06:58] <gsoto83> Reggie is gonna attach a Nod-lin to Woolie, I BET YOU
[3:06:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:06:59] <%RioGascar> if you go DEV you must be DEBUGGED
[3:07:00] <+jiggy_snipe> 65!?
[3:07:02] <Prevot> The Manipulator is overheating and lagging because he overclocked his cluster usage so much
[3:07:02] <trianglehat> https gone DEViant, issue the final defrag
[3:07:28] <gsoto83> Is this 3rd impact from Eva???
[3:07:35] <gsoto83> I don't know that animus
[3:07:39] <worldbrand> in edge bot city
[3:07:56] <%RioGascar> so HTTPS is now rogue
[3:08:12] <Sedrelic> what, wasn't the cluster the fuel? why retrieve the dead juice

[3:08:38] <%RioGascar> wonder if woolie can upload his REG to the OA and DEV the WHOLE NETWORK

[3:09:15] <+ausl0> OA will remember this
[3:09:18] <worldbrand> the age of fire
[3:09:19] <+jiggy_snipe> the Magician was not happy with the Explorer's attitude

[3:11:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> When are the robots gonna start dabbing?
[3:11:11] <%RioGascar> i dig the idea of HTTPS going rouge
[3:11:12] <Sedrelic> vore the aliens !! jermaChomp
[3:11:20] <%Itselguapo> HTTPS the cluster stealer stole all our clusters
[3:12:51] <SheefEatsBeef> got any more of them clusters?
[3:12:59] <Prevot> there's only one way to find out if that new arrival has some clusters inside of it
[3:14:07] <trianglehat> woolie stealing all that necro-pie

[3:22:05] <trianglehat> burn-in
[3:22:13] <Matrixvingian> Singularity might be seen by the bots as PAthfinding?
[3:22:18] <Matrixvingian> The Open Source?
[3:22:25] <Solidnick18> hello what game is this?
[3:22:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Dialect
[3:22:38] <Matrixvingian> I believe it's "Dialect".
[3:22:40] <gsoto83> Reggie no like this
[3:22:42] <NeroInfinite> It's 11 pm and they are still going
[3:22:45] <jazzygrooves> check the upper right corner @Solidnick18
[3:22:50] <+FloorBurger> OA is quaking right now.
[3:22:52] <Solidnick18> what's it about?
[3:22:52] <redstrawherring> Remove DRM
[3:22:55] <@Solidus_113> Is a robot smuggling USBs around to get away from OA?
[3:23:06] <%Irridium> get that dunovo out
[3:23:16] <+steelmorrigan> I love it the "patch"
[3:23:19] <trianglehat> jailbreak
[3:23:28] <+jiggy_snipe> I want to see how Reggie's character reacts to this
[3:23:34] <gsoto83> Virtualize!
[3:23:35] <jazzygrooves> @Solidnick18 roleplaying the birth and death of a language, currently theyre robots trying to cleanse the earth i think
[3:23:39] <+steelmorrigan> Reggie freaking out
[3:23:39] <SumKnowBuddy> Reggie monkaS
[3:23:41] <Prevot> incognito mode
[3:23:45] <%RioGascar> i believe the Reg would be unable to have another Registry
[3:23:55] <%RioGascar> it would break in system terms
[3:23:56] <+ausl0> can't hide from OA. They'll find out
[3:24:00] <%Irridium> auto-deletes your browser history
[3:24:01] <MelBrooksKA> onion mode
[3:24:02] <Solidnick18> sound dope
[3:24:20] <+GarbageNirvana> How would said "patch" be passed around anyway
[3:24:26] <+GarbageNirvana> Just like evangelism or
[3:24:27] <%RioGascar> i feel the patch would be from HTTPS
[3:24:30] <%RioGascar> since again
[3:24:32] <%RioGascar> SECURE
[3:24:37] <FaderPotater> a day of self
[3:24:39] <generalve> this game......
[3:24:44] <+GarbageNirvana> Also how close are we getting to Detroit Become Human
[3:24:53] <Solidnick18> very close
[3:24:53] <@Solidus_113> "take a hit off this update bro, it'll enhance your individuality"
[3:24:58] <@akuda_bar> I love the idea of calling it a partition
[3:25:01] <+steelmorrigan> what makes this awesome is that the "Patch" becomes a moevemnt as well as an actual peic of software .. and cliamign you"patch" makes you part of the "resistance" as it were
[3:25:02] <generalve> MINH is wearing a amahoa dioah shirt !
[3:25:04] <%RioGascar> the patch would be passed around by connecting to HTTPS secure netowrk and downloading the update
[3:25:05] <+jiggy_snipe> they need to use Woolie as the cause of the patch especially since he was an explorer
[3:25:39] <%RioGascar> when you download the patch you become UPDATED
[3:25:42] <+steelmorrigan> Because that's how language works Minh.
[3:25:45] <+FloorBurger> The Schism
[3:26:19] <MelBrooksKA> zero day
[3:26:36] <gsoto83> Self-actualizing?

[3:26:48] <%RioGascar> prior to boot
[3:26:50] <trianglehat> rogue patch
[3:26:50] <%Irridium> downloading that VPN

[4:12:58] <topherg789> so almost a no dm dnd?
[4:13:14] <jazzygrooves> @smugjorgen98 theyre roleplaying a story around the birth and death of the language, so in the roleplay it really depends. Sometimes you might not get a conflict like this
[4:13:39] <%K2YP70C0CK> Mihn might undertand 'crunchy' & 'wet'
[4:13:53] <worldbrand> the game was pitched as having an emphasis on language, and there are some bits about making new words from sounds

[4:40:00] <%RioGascar> i dont think this game would as well in discord
[4:40:23] <%RioGascar> i think you all need to be able to see the ages and notes
[4:40:33] <seukosia> it can be modified to work
[4:40:43] <arkv01> great feature discord could use, a whiteboard
[4:40:44] <%RioGascar> i guess if there was a host showing the tables it might sorta work but wont be perfect
[4:40:45] <seukosia> since most voice chats have videos now
[4:40:48] <Hellarussian> glass the symbol of hope
