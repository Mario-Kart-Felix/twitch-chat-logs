[0:00:32] <fairore> nice
[0:00:34] <leith_aziz> My only point (about the gore with MK) is why go for the effort of going SO in detail about intestines and shit if its pointless ? People suffer PTSD for this shit.
[0:00:34] <%SouLucha> woolieYE
[0:00:38] <+Veraverse> Damn
[0:00:39] <twoto858> wOW

[0:00:49] <%Irridium> Strive's so good I'm so sad the servers are down :(
[0:00:50] <twoto858> The power of rollback netcode
[0:00:52] <DSD24> @leith_aziz Its why I like the earlier MK
[0:00:55] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh this is V-tuber Johns huh
[0:00:55] <%Lion_kun> You're gonna hurt yourself.
[0:00:57] <fairore> @a0n33 oh really
[0:00:58] <+BusterRepukken> GG's servers are down?
[0:01:05] <fairore> @a0n33 who was it
[0:01:07] <+BusterRepukken> i thought it was open beta
[0:01:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> It shouldn't even be Johns, it was a close match
[0:01:10] <DSD24> @leith_aziz Just heads and arms and shit not intestines and stuff
[0:01:16] <leith_aziz> GG servers are down
[0:01:21] <%X2Eliah> It's wild to see a game that actually WORKS on day 1
[0:01:28] <+A0N33> It was one of the holostars, I forgot exactly who but it's part of their stream archive, I think there's a post about it on the subreddit.
[0:01:35] <ElPlasa> @fairore It was Shien from holostars
[0:01:36] <%Irridium> open beta for everyone doesn't start until 10PM Eastern Tonight, before this anyone who pre-ordered got early access
[0:01:40] <BlackermanZX> so hows the nago training
[0:01:40] <leith_aziz> @DSD24: I get you
[0:01:43] <%SouLucha> Woolie got one on Octopimp's stream, so it wasn't for nothing!
[0:01:59] <%gatorafan> Woolie keeps moving forward
[0:01:59] <%unforgivable_duragon> unforgivable_duragon subscribed with Prime.
[0:02:01] <%SouLucha> One of his few losses too!

[0:02:19] <%Irridium> good luck getting in on a good Axyl
[0:02:19] <andre11dr> I don't know why they were so scared about him.,he's basically just like ABA
[0:02:20] <%SouLucha> Octo was destroying it for most of last night!
[0:02:26] <DSD24> Shien! that's it
[0:02:29] <%SouLucha> Pot is still great!

[0:03:43] <BlackermanZX> give fear doodNuts
[0:03:44] <+Grayhammatter> nice woolie
[0:03:44] <DSD24> I didn't see much of him
[0:03:49] <leith_aziz> I dont think Chipp is good
[0:03:53] <%X2Eliah> It's really hard to internalize
[0:03:56] <GeoffGeofreed> Take those Ls Woolz, they will prepare you for getting dem Ws.
[0:03:59] <%krispen_wa> "It's so early that winning and losing means nothing" - SURE WOOLIE
[0:04:00] <leith_aziz> He has TOD's that kill him
[0:04:01] <DSD24> He's got low health right?
[0:04:10] <@Menitta> what floor. I wanna fight.
[0:04:16] <jellssssss20> Is that GG or?
[0:04:16] <LinxGG> it mattered to obama LUL
[0:04:18] <abusywizard> MajinObama had a field day and it was too good to look away from
[0:04:24] <leith_aziz> If your good at mixing, hes fine maybe even good
[0:04:26] <%Lion_kun> Woolie lost
[0:04:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> Why does Wollie play low-tier characters like Darli and Nago? IS HE THE TRUE LOW TIER GOD!?
[0:04:35] <%Lion_kun> Woolie got wrecked by a vtuber.
[0:04:37] <+hoenhime344> "pick a top tier"
[0:04:39] <%X2Eliah> @LinxGG let's be real it seemed to matter a whole lot more for trump not long ago :P
[0:04:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> Just say you want to rematch the V-tuber Woolie no one will judge you
[0:04:40] <dark_dmt_samurai> mk the movie looks so cool
[0:04:43] <%gatorafan> WIN! Woolie!
[0:04:48] <%gatorafan> SoBayed
[0:04:50] <DSD24> I want the money to work for me
[0:04:51] <+bigdrifter> Can a noob have fun playing strive or should i avoid it?
[0:04:56] <leith_aziz> Experience from loss
[0:05:03] <leith_aziz> Play the beta
[0:05:04] <%krispen_wa> Look at Woolie trying to rationalize him getting rekt
[0:05:06] <+hoenhime344> i think we got to see Noob Saibot in the trailer. hard to tell though
[0:05:07] <+yeknomlive> yes the game's mechanics are very new player friendly
[0:05:09] <+KillMyPast> Obamas is still waiting for a challenge
[0:05:13] <watchdv> Has reggie tried strive
[0:05:14] <JayEarly> @leith_aziz yeah but the clip going around of Chipp getting one shot by Nago has the Chipp making a dumb mistake
[0:05:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Really digging the new camera setup.
[0:05:22] <%X2Eliah> You can also get more consistent at getting rekt
[0:05:25] <%HitchhikingThrough> Losing is far more likely to up your experience
[0:05:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> That's why fighting games suck
[0:05:35] <%krispen_wa> losing just makes me quit
[0:05:39] <+yeknomlive> you learn way more off of losing than winning
[0:05:46] <%krispen_wa> winning makes me feel good enough to play more
[0:05:46] <BlackermanZX> mfs feelin good winnin' against a new character with old legacy characters huh
[0:05:53] <andre11dr> Everyone was so confused when Conor got smoked, when Dustin is just amazing and he was a huge treat
[0:06:02] <LinxGG> @X2Eliah wait wat? I was talking about majinobama
[0:06:06] <%X2Eliah> Hypothetical question from a FGC: DO you like having skin on your thumb?
[0:06:08] <+hoenhime344> na you gotta loose. take it from me. i beat my friends ass all the time in the neighborhood. but the sec i stepped into a tourny...
[0:06:17] <%SouLucha> Learning how to lose and keeping up your motivation to keep playing is just as important as learning how to win.
[0:06:18] <%Lion_kun> Only people who say losing is fine are people who never win.
[0:06:19] <leith_aziz> The issues with fighting games is that people MUST take losses and learn from that. You cant blame teammates
[0:06:22] <Ultra_Pancake> How shounen lol
[0:06:24] <DSD24> Getting stronger all the time
[0:06:29] <fairore> I'm just happy to see everyone having fun
[0:06:32] <%X2Eliah> No, if you win you win
[0:06:34] <GeoffGeofreed> If winning is the only thing that you will find enjoyment of something then being a noob in fighting games would be hard
[0:06:40] <leith_aziz> And unlike singleplayer games, there is no pattern
[0:06:41] <+eanscrale> This like explaining why Goku gave cell the senzu bean.
[0:06:45] <%X2Eliah> "Do the work" only matters IF you win
[0:06:52] <+hoenhime344> @X2Eliah aint that the truth
[0:07:04] <DSD24> But losing feels bad
[0:07:04] <JayEarly> tbh losing in a fighting game is less stressful than losing a game of Overwatch
[0:07:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus but some people like winning though
[0:07:14] <%Lion_kun> Man look at these VTuber johns.
[0:07:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:19] <leith_aziz> The only sulotion is getting to play games fast
[0:07:21] <watchdv> There is a pattern. Punish with a bnb combo
[0:07:24] <tacostarvedbeast> @woolieversus show your work so you can ace the test
[0:07:29] <leith_aziz> So you dont get time to stress out
[0:07:31] <%krispen_wa> the joy of winning is why I twink in Dark Souls
[0:07:32] <+hoenhime344> Overwatch is baby bitch boy game. kids should grow up with DOTA
[0:07:33] <+Veraverse> !MOTIVATED
[0:07:33] <@Moobot> 2056 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:07:59] <andre11dr> It's that Jordan shit where's like " Im only happy if i win" It stops being a game and it because an ego obsession
[0:08:02] <Ultra_Pancake> Wins and Losses though are fun and games for the audience lol.
[0:08:04] <fairore> ooo
[0:08:08] <%X2Eliah> Is this a long way of saying "yoyu didn't win though"
[0:08:14] <+hoenhime344> lolololol
[0:08:17] <GeoffGeofreed> I hate team based competitive games cause random team mates is just something to infuriating. fighting games is 1 on 1 so that's something I can get behind.
[0:08:19] <DSD24> Sounds like Woolie wants a Xanatos Gambit
[0:08:31] <tacostarvedbeast> Imagine getting perfected by a nago
[0:08:51] <leith_aziz> THIS IS IMPORTANT
[0:08:55] <+yeknomlive> this applies to all skills btw. if you're learning art dont beat yourself up just go on to the next drawing
[0:09:01] <Ultra_Pancake> I appreciate these motivational words.
[0:09:02] <%krispen_wa> @andre11dr it feels good to have an ego obsession tho
[0:09:03] <bacon_209> "Do your work, check your boxes make sure..." - woolie
[0:09:07] <+hoenhime344> welll thats not true... sometime you are not good enough to understand WHY you lost
[0:09:14] <leith_aziz> ^
[0:09:16] <fairore> when the next gg stream woolie
[0:09:17] <leith_aziz> I get that
[0:09:25] <%jaggstar2020> It's awesome beeing able to play smooth matches with people overseas.
[0:09:26] <%X2Eliah> So this is where good training modes could help, e.g. a training mode to practice and check your counter abilities, or reactions to certain inputs
[0:09:33] <leith_aziz> But Strive right now has 13 characters only
[0:09:40] <leith_aziz> So you can learn the strings
[0:09:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> Find a way to make learning in fighting games fun. That's what's necessary for them to succeed.
[0:09:55] <leith_aziz> This is good for learning
[0:10:02] <leith_aziz> You have 3 - 4 days
[0:10:05] <+hoenhime344> @X2Eliah yeaaaa but the majority of fighting game players do NOT enter paractice or tutorial
[0:10:05] <Syteal> virtual coach would be a nice bonus though
[0:10:16] <ElPlasa> RENT FREE
[0:10:17] <magiclottie> Wins in the match are also important, going 1-2 is really good to learn from
[0:10:20] <Equirah> GG's on everyone's mind LUL
[0:10:20] <+yeknomlive> for learning split it off on playing and watching and seeing what they're doing right and wrong. get a different perspective
[0:10:22] <%X2Eliah> @hoenhime344 And that's why there are so few FG players
[0:10:26] <+Grayhammatter> are you feeling gear though?
[0:10:26] <+hoenhime344> truth
[0:10:27] <BlackermanZX> what a good ass game
[0:10:27] <leith_aziz> My only sulotion is make learning itself FUN
[0:10:34] <%JuliusGemstone> JuliusGemstone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! hey woolie. hey reggie. hope you two are able to keep warm up there. its getting crazy down in the states, especially Texas. power companies are going full "pay us or parish in the cold." and government officials going full darwinist. shits crazy boys.
[0:10:37] <andre11dr> Art has been putting work in with Axl
[0:10:39] <bacon_209> that's free dad wisdom
[0:10:46] <leith_aziz> But make the game GUIDE you towards that sulotion
[0:10:54] <+yeknomlive> check out hi fight's nago. he goes in hard it's sick
[0:10:56] <GeoffGeofreed> An ideal fighting game would have a system where it would give pointers on what the player lacks and what they should improve
[0:11:01] <%krispen_wa> just make fighting games into 1v1 shooters. instant popularity
[0:11:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> Y'all stop backseating for a different game
[0:11:23] <Equirah> that's not exclusive to atlas bear, a lot of guardian spirits have knockdowns on humans @WoolieVersus
[0:11:24] <%X2Eliah> @GeoffGeofreed Yeah. Plus a reward mechanism for getting things right (so it's not just negging)
[0:11:25] <+hoenhime344> the IDEAL fighting game has been made already....its called Killer Instinct

[0:15:36] <+hoenhime344> well there is also the argument , would you take a winter ski jacket in the tropics?
[0:15:42] <+Grayhammatter> imagine investing in infrastructure LUL

[0:15:48] <Necnill> Ted's not doing nothing - he's going to Cancun
[0:15:49] <bacon_209> blaming wind
[0:15:53] <+MisleadingEchoes> "ThE WiNd EnEErGY CanT suStAiN IcE!" meanwhile bases in the poles use wind energy.
[0:15:56] <leith_aziz> I wonder how much needs to be improved till we can say USA in a positive way
[0:16:00] <Equirah> it wasn't even unexpected, they decided not to spend the money for maintnance for the weather @WoolieVersus
[0:16:03] <+BusterRepukken> @JustYudha he literally said "The strong will prevail, the weak will perish"
[0:16:04] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus They are not "doing nothing", the politicians are very busy and good at owning the libs right now

[0:19:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hey MinMin is good too, she has short hair
[0:19:14] <OldManDeckardCain> @alroy900 yes, because terrible infrastructure is limited to texas LUL also free market doesn't exist in America nd hasn't for over 100 years
[0:19:14] <%BestTeaMaker> a reminder that minmin beats up twintelle in her reveal trailer
[0:19:20] <leith_aziz> The ramen hat is cool
[0:19:24] <$arcielardor> Phoenix Wright for Smash
[0:19:24] <YakumoYomi> Famicom Detective Club?
[0:19:26] <quamdunk> MinMin is fun thoooo
[0:19:27] <tacostarvedbeast> Min min would be my second pic but yea the thicc is reddic
[0:19:28] <DSD24> They would want someone boring like Ribbon Girl
[0:19:34] <andre11dr> Why not Ryu Hayabusa
[0:19:36] <leith_aziz> 2 characters left ?
[0:19:38] <fairore> @quamdunk for who
[0:19:44] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:19:44] <velgaduere> not with that attitude
[0:19:45] <IncredibleMeh> yall are on horny autopilot
[0:19:45] <%X2Eliah> It's more fun to smashguess than to play smash
[0:19:47] <quamdunk> FOR ME DAMMIT
[0:19:50] <+TopTieramisu> put Gon Freecs in smash
[0:19:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Thank you for saving Yakuza 0, Reggie
[0:19:58] <%psidefx> ^

[0:20:16] <%Seancicle> KPOPfan KPOPfan KPOPfan
[0:20:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Get the blinds!
[0:20:25] <fairore> @dsd24 yeah they looked really good gameplay wise
[0:20:32] <%X2Eliah> I hope Reggie finds that one NPC in a cage hanging from a chain
[0:20:35] <ozmanic> Does woolie play/care mortal kombat? (since the movie trailer just dropped)
[0:20:35] <+BusterRepukken> Kiryu in Smash tho, cause Smash isn't a fighting game.
[0:20:38] <%kullumanati> Reggie vs Peanut Butter?
[0:20:41] <%kullumanati> When
[0:20:42] <alroy900> @OldManDeckardCain of course not, when you have monopolies you won't have a free market in the first place. and its pretty clear that infrastructures are shit across america XD
[0:20:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> When Reggie stands nothing is stopping The Baz staring into my soul.
[0:20:50] <twoto858> AngelThump
[0:20:50] <DSD24> @fairore Plus I think them hotswapping movesets is really cool looking
[0:20:52] <velgaduere> loud until loudn't
[0:20:52] <%X2Eliah> sounds OK so far
[0:20:53] <leith_aziz> Majima in Smaash maybe ?
[0:20:53] <fairore> that form change mid combo was sick
[0:20:55] <leith_aziz> Smash
[0:20:57] <andre11dr> But honestly i can't be mad about it ,we have a game in which Bayo can fight Terry ,im good
[0:21:19] <DSD24> Welcome back to the stage of history
[0:21:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:22] <leith_aziz> Terry was hype
[0:21:24] <Aydarkzero> still waiting on Crash tripleW
[0:21:25] <fairore> @dsd24 yeah I totally agree
[0:21:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> Banjo was a bad pick
[0:21:33] <leith_aziz> As a FE3H fan i was never mad
[0:21:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> Fight me
[0:21:36] <DatAsuna> put terry in souls
[0:21:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Counterpoint: all the picks are good, actually
[0:21:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I want like 5 Chrono Trigger characters
[0:21:40] <Mr_Zero5232> Love that intro cause I’ll never be that good at this genre
[0:21:41] <%Invlux> Yeah but who's a BAD pick Kappa
[0:21:45] <%X2Eliah> Man this comes out of nowhere for the youtube audience xD
[0:21:45] <leith_aziz> I just wish it was a house-lord
[0:21:46] <heartlesshealer> well, with minmin now we can feed yoshi some food
[0:21:49] <heartlesshealer> I guess
[0:21:51] <leith_aziz> Like Dimitri
[0:21:51] <quamdunk> Byleth by far worst one
[0:21:53] <DSD24> There is never bad picks just picks you don't care about
[0:21:54] <Blank9> pyra and mythra are cool
[0:21:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm still geeking over the Ryu and Cloud reveals from Smash 4
[0:21:55] <leith_aziz> or Claude
[0:22:01] <GeoffGeofreed> I wish it was my boi Dimitri
[0:22:02] <+BusterRepukken> I dont hate FE but Byl;eth is definetly the worst.
[0:22:06] <%krispen_wa> I guess you are my little PogChamp, come here
[0:22:07] <quamdunk> Good character but felt unwanted
[0:22:07] <%NoWayRyanTatum> dude love this new camera set up
[0:22:08] <DatAsuna> i have a hard time seeing the value in fighter pass 2
[0:22:09] <%X2Eliah> WAGYU BEEEEEF
[0:22:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Welcome back to the stage of history!
[0:22:12] <+Grayhammatter> to the stage of history
[0:22:12] <andre11dr> Also Banjo represents Rare
[0:22:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> BIG SWORD CLUB
[0:22:17] <DatAsuna> at least so far
[0:22:20] <IncredibleMeh> We got fuckin Banjo, King K Rool, and Ridley. Who's gonna complain?
[0:22:22] <DSD24> Sephiroth was cool
[0:22:24] <Darthkitten_Prime> I personally want Reimu, but Porky Minch would be a really interesting pick, imo.
[0:22:24] <DatAsuna> later chars could save it
[0:22:30] <%dreadedcthulhu> I'm just getting more and more into trad fighters and smash ultimate will only be exciting again if they add dante, melee is cooler but GUILTY GEAR THO
[0:22:30] <quamdunk> EGGMAN
[0:22:36] <+cvp5127> at least it wasn't a pokemon
[0:22:41] <DSD24> Put in Saber you nerds
[0:22:44] <+BusterRepukken> gigabrain take: add Dante to Guilty Gear
[0:22:45] <%NoWayRyanTatum> NoWayRyanTatum subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! dude love this new camera set up!
[0:22:45] <leith_aziz> How many characters are left to be revealed ?
[0:22:52] <leith_aziz> 2 ?
[0:22:53] <DatAsuna> I need to be properly into more than just 1 or 2 t
[0:22:55] <andre11dr> I wish we would've got another FF representative but Sef is fine
[0:22:56] <%X2Eliah> NOW IT GETS HARD
[0:22:57] <fairore> @darthkitten_prime who are these characters
[0:22:58] <%kewlmyc> XB2 got skipped over the in the default roster only due to not having enough time. I'm fine with Tiddy Sword making it in.
[0:23:01] <quamdunk> I think 1 atp
[0:23:02] <DatAsuna> of tbem to buy it
[0:23:03] <+Grayhammatter> now it gets hard
[0:23:04] <+yeknomlive> oh yeah i thought it was going to be that dlc kung fu bear that was gonna be the next char
[0:23:04] <+TopTieramisu> saber isn't even the best saber
[0:23:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> @busterrepukken galaxy brain plays
[0:23:08] <JayEarly> @busterrepukken i like the way u think

[0:23:14] <Aussie_Manny> BUTT
[0:23:22] <Aydarkzero> i'm glad for the picks cause someone's happy but i haven't gotten one of my favorites in tripleCOZY
[0:23:25] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu That's the trick when I say Saber I can mean anyone called Saber
[0:23:26] <%krispen_wa> NIOH WILLIAM FOR SMASH
[0:23:28] <%X2Eliah> Thumbs up for BUTT
[0:23:29] <+BusterRepukken> i feel like Dante would fit into GG like a glove.
[0:23:29] <Aussie_Manny> that shield is sick
[0:23:32] <Darthkitten_Prime> @fairore Touhou protag and Earthbound antagonist.
[0:23:34] <+smoshow21> majinoBHM
[0:23:41] <leith_aziz> Dantes is PERFECt for GG
[0:23:48] <Aussie_Manny> The Educator Sheild. doodGood
[0:24:05] <%X2Eliah> Dante in GG would work well, maybe a bit too "regular"
[0:24:08] <+Grayhammatter> DRAGON
[0:24:15] <DSD24> Hurricane!
[0:24:17] <heartlesshealer> Does GG have enough inputs for Dante?
[0:24:22] <leith_aziz> Yes
[0:24:22] <+TopTieramisu> guest character in GG?

[0:27:05] <heartlesshealer> love how much of a rat this armor set looks
[0:27:05] <%X2Eliah> Qual
[0:27:07] <NewWillinium> So I've never played Demon Souls, before I got my PS4 my last playstation thing was a PSP and PS One, so I'm wondering how is the grinding for levels in this game compared to some of the other games? Always were great for just buying one of every item in the game in the process, weapons armor and all.
[0:27:14] <heartlesshealer> smooth looks
[0:27:41] <NewWillinium> *Looks at screen* Wow that is a Giant Cleaver of a sword.
[0:27:51] <%X2Eliah> Does reggie want big and slow, or small and fast?
[0:27:56] <+KillMyPast> Estoc is for cowards
[0:28:25] <NewWillinium> Did we ever go back and pick up that Halberd from the Poison Rat Lady?
[0:28:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[0:28:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Grinding for levels is both difficult and pointless, you cap out pretty hard and souls get harder to farm
[0:29:07] <Johannen> I always took quality build to mean the option of using majority of str and dex weapons without going into deep greatswords or katanas and what not
[0:29:17] <%X2Eliah> HIGHLANDER REGGIE
[0:29:19] <NewWillinium> @fruit_pie_the_magician So the Opposite of how the later games did it then. . . .Well for the most part.

[0:30:08] <+hoenhime344> what is bigger? a claymore or a bastard sword?
[0:30:12] <%ozzrabbit> I think Reggie’s referring to the Claymore Mine
[0:30:17] <BeautifulDuwang4> Looked like a slab of Iron
[0:30:23] <+hoenhime344> im pretty sure the Odachi is the biggest sword ever made.... but idk
[0:30:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> this was my first souls game and on ps3 I was abusing dupe glitches, even duping big souls almost infinitely levelling the shit out of yourself really didnt help much
[0:30:25] <quamdunk> DSD is as big as Dante himself
[0:30:27] <linSP> claymore is way longer than bastard sword
[0:30:30] <%jonblnt> @hoenhime344 claymore
[0:30:33] <%X2Eliah> bastard sword is a hand and a half sword, claymores are two handed swords, usually larger
[0:30:35] <NewWillinium> @hoenhime344 Claymore typically. Bastard Swords were Hand and a Half. So longer Longswords
[0:30:42] <+hoenhime344> ty
[0:30:45] <ronin19xx> Demons Souls wasn't on the twitter schedule, was it?
[0:31:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> nothing was on the schedule
[0:31:04] <quamdunk> Griffith build
[0:31:07] <%X2Eliah> naw, this weeks twitter schedule was fubar
[0:31:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean besides guilty gear
[0:31:29] <ronin19xx> Did Woolz acknowledge that?
[0:31:33] <%X2Eliah> Reggie jus ttry them all out
[0:31:54] <NewWillinium> It's worth noting that the "Bastard" sword is rather modern terminology where in the same period a "longsword" typically was used in reference to a Rapier.
[0:31:56] <andre11dr> Yea real life Claymore basically looked more like what the Bastard Sword look like in this
[0:31:57] <%X2Eliah> I thin you're holding a lot of... um... a lot of... Expectations
[0:32:07] <brunoberserk> they ust started ?
[0:32:20] <%X2Eliah> @brunoberserk yeah like 10 minutes ago
[0:32:40] <NewWillinium> There were also One handed Basket Hilted Scottish Claymores.
[0:32:42] <andre11dr> You will need at least a couple
[0:32:51] <andre11dr> To do the thing
[0:33:01] <andre11dr> Against that one boss
[0:33:06] <+BusterRepukken> can you do BODEGAS
[0:33:18] <ronin19xx> Ok good I didn't miss much from this "Secret Stream" I guess
[0:33:20] <BlackermanZX> Man Kyo in XV looks sick af
[0:33:22] <velgaduere> BODEGA
[0:33:26] <+Grayhammatter> BODEGA
[0:33:26] <BlackermanZX> the hits are so chunky
[0:33:36] <+TopTieramisu> he's had a different voice since 14 i believe
[0:33:42] <%X2Eliah> @ronin19xx Yeah, secret stream was Pat's thing, Woolie just listed it as TBD
[0:33:46] <DSD24> Man Kyo doesn't get in anything
[0:33:52] <%Seancicle> woolieSHOOK Kipper should be a speed bump.
[0:33:56] <+BusterRepukken> Kyo in Smash is what Ive been saying
[0:33:58] <%X2Eliah> man that'sa long windup for a dex weapon
[0:33:59] <+Grayhammatter> super fast
[0:34:00] <ronin19xx> Ohhhhh
[0:34:01] <+TopTieramisu> outsiders don't know how sick kyo is
[0:34:09] <andre11dr> Kyo totally gets a lot of shit
[0:34:10] <BlackermanZX> if only we had some capcom x snk crossover... doodBait
[0:34:14] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's kenpo fighting style is the shit
[0:34:17] <+BusterRepukken> Terry is a Fatal Fury rep, it didnt say Smash x KOF
[0:34:19] <+TopTieramisu> way cooler than iori's imo
[0:34:22] <NewWillinium> . .Man I've been loving the moveset animations in this game. Like just watching them on youtube, because no PS5, but man that Halberd looks amazing. As does the Rapier
[0:34:22] <DSD24> Sandrock was cool
[0:34:26] <%thesw1tch> made a stream. God bless all yall in the chat
[0:34:27] <%Lightwolfe> Reggarth "Front Towards Enemy" Demonslayer
[0:34:35] <+Grayhammatter> Curved. Swords.
[0:34:38] <andre11dr> Like look at what Ryu gets and then look at what Kyo gets
[0:34:39] <+hoenhime344> kyo or kenpachi zaraki kenpo is better?
[0:34:42] <DSD24> I am more of a Epyon man myself though
[0:34:47] <%Seancicle> Pilot Quattro
[0:34:50] <brunoberserk> that looks like a warrior within weapon
[0:34:55] <+Graxe_> But that means that you will hit walls alot
[0:34:55] <%X2Eliah> How big/small is the "sweet spot" on these?
[0:34:56] <%Seancicle> contexte manquant
[0:35:00] <%thesw1tch> thesw1tch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! ayy God bless
[0:35:07] <%X2Eliah> Also yeah Reggie will wall-bounce a lot
[0:35:21] <+Graxe_> Don't halberds also have high recovery frames if you miss?
[0:35:23] <DSD24> Seeyah
[0:35:25] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's fighting style also evolved over time
[0:35:35] <+TopTieramisu> he was pretty shotoesque at first

[0:35:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Estoc?
[0:35:48] <+Grayhammatter> estoc?
[0:36:03] <Johannen> Long Sword is Bae
[0:36:05] <DSD24> Estoc was awesome in Dark Souls
[0:36:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They started changing the story to be about Kyo clones just so they could have multiple kyo styles in one game
[0:36:36] <foxname96> !uptime
[0:36:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 52 minutes and 27 seconds

[0:38:06] <+Grayhammatter> zorro is real
[0:38:06] <Aydarkzero> aren't Samurais assholes?
[0:38:12] <%nakunattakage> Yeah they were real rude rbeeLUL
[0:38:14] <%ozzrabbit> Zorro
[0:38:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> Real life always disappoints
[0:38:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie, everything you like about Samurai is fucking propaganda LUL
[0:38:19] <DatAsuna> Samuraid IRL will murder peasants for looking at them wrong
[0:38:20] <%thedankestmeeme> douchebaggins
[0:38:21] <brunoberserk> what is '' game of thrones '' ? never heard ...
[0:38:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> Someone send reggie that evo 37 fencing clip
[0:38:27] <%thedankestmeeme> ninjas are cool
[0:38:28] <Jashter18> Fencing bro on the sub is gonna have words with Reggie
[0:38:32] <+hoenhime344> if a samurai strolled into town you HAD to let him eat your food and fuck your wife
[0:38:38] <+TopTieramisu> a class of soldiers aren't decent? color me surprised
[0:38:46] <DSD24> Didn't Samurai just kill random people to test out their blades?
[0:38:47] <+MajorCrasher> yes chat, samurai we're assholes just like knights were
[0:39:00] <+MajorCrasher> we're*
[0:39:00] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dsd24 that and royals, yes
[0:39:01] <+hoenhime344> knights were dicks too. lotta rape
[0:39:02] <+cvp5127> asab
[0:39:03] <andre11dr> @hoenhime344 You say that like they even asked for permission
[0:39:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> 4-2 beaten?
[0:39:23] <+TopTieramisu> asab
[0:39:27] <Prevot> knights, samurai and cowboys were all assholes, what else? I'd say pirates but that's kinda obivous
[0:39:30] <%X2Eliah> Might aswell go all the way and choose to idolize the mongol horse archers
[0:39:34] <DatAsuna> remember if tou were the wife of a knight who died you inherited all his duties but were entitled to none of his benefits
[0:39:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Is the kilij just a better falchion?
[0:39:44] <+hoenhime344> pirates were actually NOT as big of assholes as you think
[0:39:47] <+Snazzy_Tomato> Yo this quality's great
[0:39:49] <DatAsuna> so lady knights existed but they were screwed
[0:40:09] <+hoenhime344> alot of the dickatry we know about pirates comes from the crown and the spanish
[0:40:15] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus is there another weapon like the Kilij that has the same moveset, but better stats?
[0:40:19] <Prevot> @hoenhime344 I think raping and pillaging might be kinda of a dick move, personally
[0:40:19] <+hoenhime344> pirates really just wanted to be free
[0:40:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @cappuccinoguil nah, it's heavier, has higher stat requirements, and the falchion scales better with dex
[0:40:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean to be fair they were thieves
[0:40:32] <NewWillinium> Are there basically unlimited Materials for upgrades in Demon Souls? Or was that not a thing until later games?
[0:40:38] <%X2Eliah> @hoenhime344 yeah, but its not unique to pirates
[0:40:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> very much not unlimited
[0:40:50] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[0:40:51] <DatAsuna> remember when dan ryckert discovered live on streamthat pirates stole things?
[0:40:56] <NewWillinium> Oof. I think I may actually hate that.
[0:41:00] <+TopTieramisu> it's unlimited if you go to the next NG+ :)

[0:41:16] <DatAsuna> "I thought they just dressed funny and drank a lot of rum"

[0:41:31] <+TopTieramisu> regardless of the bells and whistles
[0:41:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yo what'd I miss since he started the gameplay?
[0:41:36] <andre11dr> Vikings were huge assholes as well
[0:41:37] <DSD24> You want sharp or sharper
[0:41:44] <DatAsuna> the virgin pirate vs the chad privateer
[0:41:44] <%X2Eliah> @KeiganOfAstora some weapon tests
[0:41:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> nothing'
[0:41:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cool thanks
[0:41:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @NewWillinium the remaster made farming easier. When a lizard escaped, they were GONE until you beat a boss. Now, if they escape, they respawn. Every boss gives all lizards in the zone another "life". So you can get all materials 4 timesish
[0:41:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Checktrap

[0:42:16] <+BusterRepukken> plus hes more fun to play as well.
[0:42:19] <+Grim1952> No sharp katana?
[0:42:21] <+TopTieramisu> gotta give ryu some slack. he's like the superman of fighting game MCs

[0:42:44] <CappuccinoGuil> @Grim1952 he's too evened out for sharp. And he didn't seem to like the uchi's moveset

[0:43:15] <DSD24> There is the Black Katana Skeleton variant too
[0:43:18] <%X2Eliah> Smoochie-gatana is the best sword tho
[0:43:25] <+Grim1952> I meant tearing
[0:43:29] <andre11dr> Well, they all have the same moveset
[0:43:45] <+hoenhime344> its a tree
[0:43:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @NewWillinium some do. In this zone, some enemies carry bags and will drop TONS of materials, but they are limited. Basic stones can be bought from characters in respective zones (cloudstones in 4-1 and 4-2, for example)
[0:43:53] <DatAsuna> know and commit
[0:43:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> Or just go to the wikidot page
[0:44:00] <+hoenhime344> the UI isnt the greatest visual for representing a tree
[0:44:07] <andre11dr> At least i think, i never really used hiltless
[0:44:15] <+TopTieramisu> each zone has certain upgrade materials
[0:44:22] <NewWillinium> Eesh. So you *have* to make sure that you love a weapon's moveset before Committing then
[0:44:24] <%X2Eliah> For real they should just show the upgrade paths as a tree
[0:44:52] <+hoenhime344> @NewWillinium well... i mean yea. in any game or decision. if you commit, make sure you love it
[0:45:06] <user_naim> just pop them all and lose the rest. it’s the only way

[0:45:20] <%X2Eliah> stones
[0:45:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Can't you straight upgrade wapons until they turn into uniques?
[0:45:33] <+hoenhime344> nope
[0:45:46] <NewWillinium> @hoenhime344 In this genre I'm very used to the "you can upgrade EVERY weapon to plus 9 easily but only 3 at most to Plus 10" manner of weapon upgrades
[0:45:46] <+Grim1952> Top quality
[0:45:51] <%X2Eliah> QUAL
[0:45:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is that actually max?
[0:45:56] <CappuccinoGuil> @NewWillinium yeah, but you don't have to upgrade right away, you only REALLY commit after +6 or something, because the mats are rarer/more expensive
[0:45:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> I thought max was 10
[0:46:01] <+Grim1952> And you can add magic to it
[0:46:09] <%X2Eliah> well that is disappointing
[0:46:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @KeiganOfAstora yes
[0:46:26] <foxname96> @woolieversus He can enchant it
[0:46:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> But bows can go higher cuz I know about +6 or +7
[0:46:30] <%X2Eliah> ohhh
[0:46:34] <andre11dr> He shouldn't add magic to it if he wants to use buffs
[0:46:36] <jv5_guy> max is woolies son
[0:46:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Right, that's what I was thinking of, regular path
[0:46:47] <%Lion_kun> Meat Cleaver and Bone Smasher are way better damage wise.
[0:46:53] <+hoenhime344> but dont upgrade past 7 i think it is? it locks you out of the boss soul transofrms
[0:46:53] <+Grim1952> Yes Reggie, get that resin
[0:47:01] <%jonblnt> OMEDITO GOZAIMASU REGGIE
[0:47:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @KeiganOfAstora not if you do special upgrades, like quality
[0:47:11] <+cvp5127> back in
[0:47:14] <Prevot> love is just consumables
[0:47:25] <%kullumanati> You can not add Fire bomb to the sword
[0:47:27] <%kullumanati> Lol
[0:47:32] <user_naim> Big Resin for with Woolie messin
[0:47:33] <NewWillinium> I mean Soul Magic is kind of just Blue fire right?
[0:47:34] <+hoenhime344> lol

[0:48:49] <+hoenhime344> ima say it... i REALLY miss minh
[0:48:49] <NewWillinium> So does Demon Souls operate purely like Fashion Souls or do the Full Sets give bonuses?
[0:48:54] <%X2Eliah> BOU
[0:49:00] <%X2Eliah> USE BOU
[0:49:09] <+TopTieramisu> no full set bonuses
[0:49:12] <CappuccinoGuil> You know what shoots good? Soul ARROWS
[0:49:14] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think souls ever had that
[0:49:27] <andre11dr> Sets do totally matter
[0:49:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> Bow is more long-range than magic
[0:49:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> You uahven't needed to use it yet, so you're doing fine
[0:49:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:04] <%X2Eliah> It seems like Reg should invest more in magic if he wants to use it

[0:50:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[0:50:16] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:50:19] <NewWillinium> Mainly asking because I just realized that I've been missing Reggarth's flowing locks. . and that apparently you can get a Top Hat in this game
[0:50:25] <Blank9> got curves
[0:50:26] <%RaziWraith> It's never been "purely" fashion souls. armor has defensive value, but it's kinda different on how well it actually protects you from game to game
[0:50:37] <%Zero_Jacks> S T A N C E
[0:50:44] <+TopTieramisu> god this remake is so beautiful
[0:50:58] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:51:01] <+TopTieramisu> the environments that is
[0:51:02] <+Grim1952> If you buff it's good against anything
[0:51:06] <%RaziWraith> for example, Dark Souls armor can be upgraded to plus 10 and makes a HUGE difference.

[0:51:24] <NewWillinium> @RaziWraith This is true, especially in DS 2 and in regards to things like Poison and Bleed Resistance, but usually it's still just a major how you want your dude to look that you're dealing with.
[0:51:24] <+TopTieramisu> ds1 was armor at its strongest
[0:51:26] <+TopTieramisu> since poise
[0:51:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> whitewash
[0:51:48] <%Invlux> monkaS say again?
[0:51:52] <brunoberserk> ooooooff
[0:51:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Did Reggie say "I need to do more white things in that world"???
[0:51:53] <+cvp5127> woolieMIRIN
[0:51:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> The racial undertones are heavy
[0:51:57] <+Grim1952> A white world is what Reggie wants, huh?
[0:52:10] <+PishaMashi> hasPause
[0:52:17] <+TopTieramisu> a pure black world is the most difficult but reaps the biggest rewards
[0:52:20] <NewWillinium> Poise was basically just being able to tank a hit and keep swinging through it in DS 1 wasn't it?
[0:52:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[0:52:30] <user_naim> Battle Supremacy, I mean White Tendency
[0:52:30] <DedlokPM> @Grim1952 woolieMIRIN
[0:52:33] <$thomassolorio> white world black planet
[0:52:34] <andre11dr> Reggie always thinking about how to make the world whiter
[0:52:39] <+LordGeneric> Yeah, poise lets you swing through getting hit
[0:52:39] <+TopTieramisu> @NewWillinium which is HUGE in pvp especially
[0:52:45] <brunoberserk> uuuuuuuuuumbasa
[0:52:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Umbaaaasa
[0:52:53] <andre11dr> umbasa
[0:53:03] <+TopTieramisu> @NewWillinium in ds1, you could literally walk through a swing with enough poise and get the backstab
[0:53:05] <%patriotrenegade> @WoolieVersus try talking to Patches, he might have some useful info
[0:53:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man this Koolaid is delicious
[0:53:24] <NewWillinium> "I plan to bequeath my possessions to the likely already rich and powerful Saint"
[0:53:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ahhhh memories of DS1 LP
[0:53:44] <Raldavar> DS1 poise lets you chug estus through most attacks. It was horribly imbalanced
[0:53:46] <LordOfThePoultry> Umbasa
[0:53:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Umbasa
[0:54:05] <Raldavar> don't get me get started on poise mages spamming dark anus beads
[0:54:09] <+cvp5127> step harder
[0:54:10] <+TopTieramisu> ds1 was hella jank, but there was counter-jank as well
[0:54:11] <linSP> He got the umbasa drip
[0:54:14] <+Grim1952> Second chance wink wink
[0:54:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dayum son
[0:54:20] <brunoberserk> NEED MORE JESUS
[0:54:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Need more jeebus in yo' life
[0:54:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Begone heathen scum
[0:54:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Saint Urbain is the Freke of Faith
[0:54:30] <%X2Eliah> Reggie does need Jesus
[0:54:36] <ShortAssRibs> You're such a heathen!!!
[0:54:37] <andre11dr> That's good, you can keep it that way
[0:54:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Umbasa
[0:54:45] <NewWillinium> I appreciate how *broken* Pure mages could be in DS1. To the point of making both Artorius and Manus walks in the park with your 4 Soul Arrows.
[0:54:46] <%X2Eliah> MUMBASA
[0:54:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Umbasa emote?
[0:54:49] <LordOfThePoultry> Umbasa
[0:54:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:54:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Tim Curry?!
[0:54:56] <+TopTieramisu> weapon toggling, dead angling, forward backstepping
[0:55:07] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:55:15] <brunoberserk> blackest magic
[0:55:23] <%ChoculaUltra> wow, that's no way to talk about the local grass dealer
[0:55:25] <andre11dr> "God"
[0:55:26] <DSD24> Feeling like a Hero
[0:55:27] <%X2Eliah> Reggie do you WANT to go to hell for ever?
[0:55:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> World is overrun with Demons. Better pray to God who is not showing up.
[0:55:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhhh I love my lvl 27 invaded build with wrath of the gods and dark bead
[0:55:43] <NewWillinium> That Saint is WACK! But my Saint? My Saint is cool.
[0:55:45] <DSD24> Dearest Astraea
[0:55:48] <ShortAssRibs> Saint Derp
[0:55:51] <%X2Eliah> All faith people talk a lot
[0:55:59] <%patriotrenegade> Patches has good intel on other assholes in Boletaria
[0:56:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> degenerate miscreants
[0:56:12] <%SouLucha> Patches is the only "friend" you need Kappa
[0:56:13] <+TopTieramisu> this game's lore is dope
[0:56:20] <+cvp5127> @X2Eliah just like real life
[0:56:25] <CappuccinoGuil> That Lady Astrea? A HUSSY!
[0:56:37] <%cache_22> These Umbasa-thumpers
[0:56:37] <linSP> these faith fools need to be vaati-pilled
[0:56:55] <+cvp5127> LUL
[0:56:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[0:56:59] <%X2Eliah> That was the REAL reason people went to church on sundays
[0:57:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh I know way too many people like this.
[0:57:04] <+hoenhime344> Demons souls is my fav game out of this genre... mainly because its nostalgia.
[0:57:04] <DSD24> High on Moon Grass
[0:57:10] <+hoenhime344> but the lore is baller
[0:57:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Saint Urbain is chill, though, right? I don't remember his lines
[0:57:14] <%Invlux> "I HATE drama. Listen to all this drama I'm involved in voluntarily"
[0:57:14] <andre11dr> So these guys are stupid but so is Frake a little because Miracles and Magic are the same thing in this universe and they both come from The Old One
[0:57:15] <%dreadedcthulhu> I am very smart
[0:57:17] <$Boreos_GLHF> ShowLove1000
[0:57:20] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:57:23] <%HitchhikingThrough> seems like a real turning point in reggie's opinion
[0:57:24] <%baka_sugoi> I NEED MY FOOD
[0:57:28] <brunoberserk> you let him lives
[0:57:29] <%cache_22> Woolie Shapiro woolieSPICE
[0:57:29] <NewWillinium> That kind of Busy Body keeping a tight community thing can be cool. . . until the judgement and trying to tell you how to live schiesse comes out.
[0:57:33] <ShortAssRibs> CHECK YO ETHICS
[0:57:33] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[0:57:34] <Prevot> maybe if they legalized grass Reggie wouldn't need to give Patches any money
[0:57:37] <%SouLucha> YOU FELL
[0:57:41] <tacostarvedbeast> If I was dough” hits me on a spiritual level
[0:57:43] <+Grim1952> He did you a favor
[0:57:45] <DSD24> You fund his business curious
[0:57:47] <ashuckel> reggie is giving Patches bullets for him to kill others for more grass
[0:57:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Thats when it's time to kick some back
[0:57:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> "Sometimes you have to go to Wal-Mart." Reggie 2021
[0:58:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Game recognizes Game
[0:58:14] <andre11dr> He's not even that old
[0:58:22] <%X2Eliah> "How can you hate this guy?" HE AINT WITH GOD
[0:58:23] <andre11dr> He looks like 40
[0:58:30] <knight_of_the_edge> so what worlds has he finished so far this stream???

[0:58:52] <Syteal> you can always buy from good guy Blige!!
[0:58:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie versus Umbasa
[0:58:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> Patches is the true hero
[0:58:56] <ashuckel> It shows Patches boy count in search for your grass
[0:58:59] <%X2Eliah> 100% faith
[0:59:06] <dundore77> He can't make money/souls off you why would he talk to you
[0:59:06] <%krispen_wa> Woolie... Versus.... God?
[0:59:08] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus at the same time, Freke doesn't need int, he looks for Magic in you.
[0:59:13] <+Grayhammatter> good guy blige

[0:59:17] <%patriotrenegade> WoolieVSGod
[0:59:21] <andre11dr> @commandersqueaks Actually i don't think it is in this game, im pretty sure that's just a Dark Souls thing
[0:59:39] <+ProfAnger> what stats is reggie short on to use the cleaver? Cause it has the ability shortage indicator on it
[0:59:46] <%X2Eliah> str
[0:59:47] <+TopTieramisu> time being convoluted is a dark souls thing
[0:59:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @ProfAnger strength
[0:59:49] <+hoenhime344> sit DOWN
[0:59:51] <+Grim1952> Just fall on him
[0:59:54] <andre11dr> At least i think time works normally in DeS i might be wrong
[0:59:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SIT THE FUCK DOWN
[1:00:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Get in his ass and kilij him
[1:00:03] <BlackermanZX> POP POP
[1:00:05] <Tooniearcade> evoMindBlown evoMindBlown evoMindBlown
[1:00:08] <ashuckel> what is a sword
[1:00:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @Grim1952 if he falls, he'll stagger for a moment and get killed. There's no fall attack
[1:00:11] <%ChoculaUltra> he said the thing!
[1:00:12] <+TopTieramisu> pretty sure andre11dr 's right
[1:00:15] <+ProfAnger> even ability shorted its still beast
[1:00:16] <user_naim> That’s a damn near crush counter
[1:00:21] <KaiserMario> Too thick, too blunt
[1:00:24] <CappuccinoGuil> PANCAKED
[1:00:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> BIG NUBER

[1:00:50] <Equirah> @TopTieramisu @andre11dr they absolutely mention time heroes being trapped through time inside of the fog in the intro
[1:00:59] <DSD24> Caught you sleeping
[1:00:59] <+hoenhime344> ^
[1:01:02] <BlackermanZX> doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[1:01:05] <RyanGelatin> run away like a coward, my favorite strategy
[1:01:05] <+Grim1952> Try fire
[1:01:06] <%X2Eliah> It seems like reggie likes the big chunky weapons
[1:01:06] <+robertoszek> everytime? everytime
[1:01:09] <+ProfAnger> yeah the prince talks about heroes from ages past or whatever
[1:01:11] <Klefth> Everytime
[1:01:18] <+ProfAnger> thats probably why doran is around
[1:01:29] <BlackermanZX> you need your pills
[1:01:31] <CappuccinoGuil> That shield is the good stuff
[1:01:33] <+TopTieramisu> maybe doran has that good healthcare
[1:01:34] <nthquery_> My pills
[1:01:36] <ronin19xx> Every time
[1:01:37] <%Noonoox12> Yo @WoolieVersus ! Just tweeted you a 2m Nago video that went up this morning of REALLY handy tech
[1:01:41] <Klefth> Adjudicator's Shield, not even once
[1:01:44] <velgaduere> PILLS HERE
[1:02:00] <%Pillagius> I wonder if I'm the only one who has "Skeleton Warriors" cartoon intro theme playing in the head whenever I hear "Skeleton Warrior"
[1:02:01] <Syteal> I hate these 3 skeletons specifically except you can make em fall off the edge
[1:02:04] <+TopTieramisu> ah, demon's souls. when archers never stop archering, regardless of distance
[1:02:11] <andre11dr> I always assumed that Doran was just immortal because he's basically a demigod or something
[1:02:13] <%X2Eliah> @Pillagius me too, man. me too
[1:02:29] <%Pillagius> @Pillagius it's a cool theme tho :D
[1:02:30] <%X2Eliah> Ah god Fury Road was such a great movie
[1:02:33] <%Amaideus> Almost missed the stream, whoo
[1:02:36] <$thomassolorio> do not become addicted to water
[1:02:41] <DSD24> Oo just barely
[1:02:50] <CappuccinoGuil> The greatest weapon of the Demon Slayer: A foot high wall LUL
[1:02:52] <DSD24> Too much water will kill you
[1:03:00] <KaiserMario> Has Reggie reached pillar man yet?
[1:03:02] <+hoenhime344> i kinda miss how in the OG the mantis spears were GIANT and stuck into the wall
[1:03:05] <%patriotrenegade> Do not, my friends, become ADDICTED to regen! It will take hold of you, and you will RESENT its absence!
[1:03:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus Reggie can Soul Ray the Manta Rays
[1:03:15] <whirly25> I thought the line was "...you will resent its absence"
[1:03:15] <+hoenhime344> the glass braking is cool...buutttt
[1:03:15] <+ProfAnger> I think he was probably a normal person who became a legend and the fog makes him show up in the way people came to think of him
[1:03:23] <dundore77> i like how the cleaver is classified as a giant club
[1:03:33] <$Boreos_GLHF> RIPCheer1000 dying much
[1:03:36] <ShortAssRibs> "The" Pancake
[1:03:39] <+TopTieramisu> hyper armor
[1:03:40] <+Grayhammatter> a gamestop trade
[1:03:41] <DSD24> Gold Standard Skeleton
[1:03:44] <+ProfAnger> like how the demons take the form of what people in the area regarded as powerful
[1:03:48] <Blank9> I always thief ringed because I hate the stingrays
[1:03:52] <%Lion_kun> Was idle.
[1:04:19] <andre11dr> I think it does both blunt and slashing damage technically
[1:04:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:04:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> backdoor

[1:04:21] <%Invlux> woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD
[1:04:21] <Raldavar> Turns out knee high ruble is indeed better than a magic gate. DS2 best souls confirmed
[1:04:26] <+b_aleph> that's what she said
[1:04:26] <velgaduere> lobosLewd
[1:04:28] <%Pillagius> yeah, the "backdoor"
[1:04:42] <BlackermanZX> scuffed but it works
[1:04:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Ah yes the backdoor woolieMIRIN
[1:05:06] <NewWillinium> Man. . .it would be nice if having a Shield on your back *ever* made it so that attacks to your back did less damage
[1:05:17] <+TopTieramisu> demon's souls protagonist has the best mobility of all souls protagonists
[1:05:18] <%X2Eliah> whiff
[1:05:34] <+hoenhime344> lol its so fun to see reggie happy
[1:05:39] <+TopTieramisu> that was some hitbox porn
[1:05:43] <+Grim1952> Whoosh
[1:05:43] <+ProfAnger> the advantage of having it on your back is just that you can switch to it fast
[1:05:47] <+hoenhime344> playing with his new toys
[1:05:52] <%Pillagius> Reggie SMAAASH! rooG rooG
[1:06:07] <andre11dr> @raldavar Except for the part where you could totally glitch thew it and skip half the game
[1:06:07] <+ProfAnger> if you got to use it from behind without actually equipping it it would be busted
[1:06:28] <user_naim> How does he keep dodging projectiles by gathering shit off the floor?
[1:06:39] <user_naim> It’s like his signature move

[1:10:42] <CappuccinoGuil> just wait a minute
[1:10:46] <$JobbedBone> I love when games have both the normal hitbox, and a surrounding "grazing" hitbox that applies less damage but doesn't hitstun. Especially for effects like magic
[1:10:48] <SilverFaustX> oyeaaa he was glitched out at dg
[1:11:05] <+fetrigon> monkaS
[1:11:05] <%Pillagius> don't die!

[1:29:05] <CappuccinoGuil> @CommanderSqueaks and I need to know how tall the Old Hero is Kreygasm
[1:29:06] <+hoenhime344> the theif ring makes this fight so trivial

[1:31:58] <DSD24> This is the first attempt
[1:32:00] <DedlokPM> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ literally 1st attempt on this boss
[1:32:07] <Equirah> thief ring didn't use to break him this much, he'd still tell where you were swinging from
[1:32:09] <Reveresao> if the MK movie does not make me want to do running flying bicycle kicks to my bed, it's trash.
[1:32:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh ok, so I didn't miss much
[1:32:15] <+Grayhammatter> he's mad
[1:32:18] <+Graxe_> Reggie's also in soul form
[1:32:23] <%Lion_kun> This is so pathetic.
[1:32:24] <+Graxe_> So much more quieter footsteps

[1:32:32] <+hoenhime344> woolie is so mad at himself lolololol
[1:32:33] <%Lion_kun> I feel sorry for the boss.
[1:32:35] <%Amaideus> Go ham until roar, run away
[1:32:36] <+BurncoatRapscallion> If I remember right, I think he only gets super aggro when you attack him while he yells
[1:32:40] <DedlokPM> @Lion_kun yet it is working so who cares really
[1:32:42] <%Seancicle> VoteYea
[1:32:42] <+cvp5127> bully him

[1:33:28] <andre11dr> He waa lulucky he remembered about thief ring
[1:33:29] <%krispen_wa> FIRST TRY
[1:33:29] <dundore77> reggie realized he's blind right away and used the correct stuff to make it easy
[1:33:30] <CoffeeSlice> GG EZ
[1:33:31] <%jonblnt> GG LUL LUL

[1:33:38] <+hoenhime344> Reggie can beat up Stinkmeiner
[1:33:40] <Johannen> Flawless Victory
[1:33:43] <DSD24> Wow Reggie you killed a blind man
[1:33:43] <linSP> The first time I got to this guy he was impossible to kill with loud strats
[1:33:45] <+fetrigon> YEEEEAAAAHH you beat up a blind guy
[1:33:45] <+Graxe_> If Reggie was in body form, Old Hero would've found Reggie several times
[1:33:46] <%patriotrenegade> Better than Woolie
[1:33:49] <%Sparkseid> Perfect
[1:33:50] <%jonblnt> i love when the level is harder than the boss
[1:33:51] <ShortAssRibs> RESPECT
[1:33:52] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's infuriating when the messages ruin your fun isn't it? LUL
[1:33:53] <Pyrrhus90> reggie beating old blind people
[1:33:53] <%Amaideus> Well earned
[1:33:53] <+Deosier> bullying the blind man
[1:33:54] <+TopTieramisu> alexa, play the roy jones jr song
[1:33:55] <+Grim1952> Storm King!
[1:33:58] <user_naim> Shanking a blind man, GGs
[1:34:03] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Messages are part of the game, guy
[1:34:04] <+liquidzr0> so proud about beating a blind man LUL
[1:34:04] <%vVAstrAVv> i never saw a more pathetic boss. not even pinwheel
[1:34:08] <%Lion_kun> That was flawless execution.
[1:34:11] <Mr_Zero5232> Careful Reg, this how ya fall
[1:34:11] <andre11dr> That fight is way different without thief ring
[1:34:14] <%LastHazzerd> He's cool tho
[1:34:14] <brunoberserk> he is a gimmick boss
[1:34:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> Reggie getting hype over beating a blind man like grandad freeman
[1:34:28] <%Amaideus> @WoolieVersus Don't help him at all with stormruler :^)
[1:34:28] <CoffeeSlice> but reggie noticed it
[1:34:30] <DSD24> Plus the Old Hero got that cool design
[1:34:35] <andre11dr> It becomes a DS3 fight without thief ring
[1:34:35] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus doesn't he have the ring on also
[1:34:37] <peachy996> Lot of Gimmick Bosses in DeS
[1:34:48] <+Graxe_> Blind enemy + Thief Ring + Soul Form
[1:34:51] <+fetrigon> @brunoberserk most bosses in demon souls are gimmick puzzle bosses
[1:34:53] <treasonodb> lol i have beat him multiple times and had no idea he was blind til now
[1:34:57] <+hoenhime344> yea but they are good designed bosses...cept DG
[1:35:08] <+ProfAnger> I didnt know soul form meant less noise
[1:35:09] <%cache_22> I think Reggie also remembered that the Dragon God yelled out as an audio clue for attacks.
[1:35:21] <andre11dr> Spiking of gimmick bosses were about to see the best one
[1:35:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fear is the appropriate response.
[1:35:25] <%Amaideus> THAT'S CORRECT
[1:35:30] <andre11dr> Im so hype
[1:35:31] <%Amaideus> That's why the first few attempts tend to be the best
[1:35:32] <+b_aleph> Pat died to this guy a dozen times
[1:35:32] <+TopTieramisu> demon's souls bosses are more puzzles and interesting mechanics than just tough encounters
[1:35:37] <+b_aleph> Pat SUX!
[1:35:39] <+hoenhime344> Fear is NOT the mind killer
[1:35:40] <DSD24> Clapping for killing a blind man
[1:35:42] <CappuccinoGuil> Feel yourself, you've earned it
[1:35:43] <dundore77> Reggie feels big and strong beating a blind old man
[1:35:43] <Rafraud> ezclap
[1:35:46] <+b_aleph> Reggie bois unite!
[1:35:48] <+robertoszek> good job Reggie
[1:35:48] <%jonblnt> thief ring putting in work
[1:35:51] <SeniorTop> Reggie perfectly executed the advice, he put the shield on his back went 2 handed, watched him learned his moves. He read the message and immediately put on the thief ring. Perfect execution for a first try.
[1:35:55] <+hoenhime344> Reggie vs Stinkmeiner
[1:36:07] <+TopTieramisu> reggie's lucky he didn't use his domain expansion
[1:36:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love how Dark Souls/Demon Souls/Bloodborne does an amazing job of making massive, intimidating bosses that are also kind of sad when you think about them.
[1:36:23] <andre11dr> I actually like fighting him without thief ring, it because a super aggressive fight
[1:36:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damage is good. Go for some Vitality or Endurance
[1:37:05] <user_naim> Old Hero is also doing a blind playthrough.
[1:37:14] <+TopTieramisu> it's interesting that his eyes being covered is a clue to his blindness when that's not the case at all in bloodborne
[1:37:22] <%Frazzyfraznor> Also one of the most difficult levels to get through so nice work
[1:37:24] <%vVAstrAVv> come ooooon magic
[1:37:41] <andre11dr> I really hope Woolie just tells him to go to 4-3
[1:37:43] <knight_of_the_edge> @WoolieVersus this would be a good time to raise your magic
[1:37:46] <%justcallmebobplease> He COULD hit faith for Meat Cleaver, right?
[1:37:47] <%Amaideus> Maybe BB bosses with their eyes covered ARE blind but they can just smell you out
[1:37:50] <DSD24> Well people have Eyes on the Inside in Bloodborne
[1:37:54] <+Grim1952> Faith is no joke either
[1:38:02] <resloxxx> well, blooborne theme is diferent as the sight and insight thingy
[1:38:02] <$Boreos_GLHF> SeemsGood
[1:38:03] <%Amaideus> Even the "human" Yharnamites have sick senses of smell
[1:38:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> NEVER spread it out that much
[1:38:13] <+TopTieramisu> pretty sure the choir members don't have a heightened sense of smell
[1:38:17] <%vVAstrAVv> sprrad even thinerer
[1:38:18] <Rafraud> shhhhh
[1:38:22] <Rafraud> let him spread
[1:38:33] <Blank9> pump ALL magic do it do it
[1:38:34] <dundore77> ultimately if you "waste" a level you can grind off screen if you aren't pvp your soul level isn't relevant and you get more options to play with
[1:38:43] <+Grim1952> You can use the cleaver and moonlight sword with faith, they're busted
[1:38:52] <andre11dr> Bloodbornes world is wierd because it's unclear is any of it is even real
[1:38:59] <+TopTieramisu> moonlight sword looks so good in desr
[1:39:05] <Rafraud> I mean he's going to get soul sucked at least once its fine
[1:39:19] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne's world is real. the dreams and nightmares are the weird spaces
[1:39:29] <+TopTieramisu> and the dungeons too
[1:39:36] <%Javaa01> Though if you wanna keep using the Cleaver, consider pumping up to 26str
[1:39:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:39:46] <%vVAstrAVv> woolies done it again
[1:39:51] <+Grim1952> It's kinda implied that the whole game is also a dream. It's up to personal interpretation
[1:39:59] <diggentein> everythings real its lovecraft stuff all dreams are physical plains @TopTieramisu
[1:40:11] <diggentein> planes*
[1:40:14] <+TopTieramisu> i said they're weird spaces
[1:40:17] <+TopTieramisu> didn't say they weren't real
[1:40:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> His sword
[1:40:23] <+TopTieramisu> but they are influenced by the host
[1:40:31] <diggentein> yeah its dope i love it
[1:41:12] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is not faithing
[1:41:14] <BurdRightsActivist> SECOND CHANCE
[1:41:16] <andre11dr> It looks really cool but it's not op or anything
[1:41:25] <%Javaa01> Second Chance is fuckbusted, and can save you from all but one enemy attack in the game
[1:41:45] <andre11dr> The sword that is ,Second Chance is fucking broken as shit
[1:41:48] <+TopTieramisu> second chance is the most powerful tool of a coward
[1:41:49] <%Javaa01> It can't save you from jobber flailing, cause that's a stunlock

[1:41:53] <%X2Eliah> eeeh that's lame
[1:41:58] <%Javaa01> But everything else you can live through with Second Chance

[2:06:20] <%Lion_kun> He thinks there's a forest lol
[2:06:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:06:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> They'll often have their animators do the key frames and then they'll outsource the inbetweens.

[2:21:22] <Syteal> magic weaponnnn
[2:21:24] <Blank9> bumps strength for all your attacks too
[2:21:28] <baron_of_salt> Mages hate it. Here's one cool trick on how to make a fuckin' anti-magic field
[2:21:52] <%RaziWraith> I mean how good even is anti-magic field?
[2:21:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[2:21:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HYPA MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODE
[2:22:01] <%Amaideus> It's that DBZ shit
[2:22:01] <%X2Eliah> LIMITERS OFF
[2:22:04] <DatAsuna> That's the name
[2:22:12] <%RaziWraith> set radius around you doesn't stop magic bolts flying at your face
[2:22:17] <+RealPT1> desperation mode
[2:22:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> super sicko mode: unlocked
[2:22:42] <Blank9> but no regen allowed
[2:22:44] <DatAsuna> the swing first meta
[2:22:49] <+RealPT1> EX Carmine
[2:22:50] <SilverFaustX> with 56magic u can 4 hit kill maneater
[2:22:54] <DSD24> The closer I am to the sweet release of death the stronger I am
[2:22:59] <%Javaa01> Or become a parry god
[2:22:59] <+Grayhammatter> swing first, no other swing
[2:23:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> no hit strats
[2:23:17] <+hoenhime344> @SilverFaustX isnt 40 the soft cap for 1st playthrough?
[2:23:23] <%Dapper_Cactuar> it's like the fighter class in PSO2: melt shit just don't get hit or you're kissing the floor
[2:23:28] <andre11dr> It's like playing Akuma
[2:23:28] <%Amaideus> 40 is the softcap period
[2:23:30] <Chimeraelite> Welcome to why these games are cult level loved
[2:23:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's the fun of these games. Trying different things
[2:23:46] <%X2Eliah> fair
[2:24:09] <%Amaideus> It's really annoying honestly, when I was designing my own soulslike I had the scaling actually go up to 99 properly
[2:24:27] <SilverFaustX> hardcap is 99
[2:24:39] <SilverFaustX> so it still helps
[2:24:40] <%Frazzyfraznor> Reggie seems to like the high risk high reward play style
[2:24:45] <Chimeraelite> Play The Cinders Mod @Amaideus then. It's for DS3. No cap on scaling I believe
[2:24:46] <%Amaideus> Double the points you gain per level, make 41-99 actually worth doing, lower the max powerlevel slightly to compensate, easy
[2:24:59] <%X2Eliah> MAP COMPLETE
[2:24:59] <BlackermanZX> the mantas though
[2:25:01] <%Amaideus> It's on the list eventually
[2:25:02] <andre11dr> Some stats do scale up to 99
[2:25:12] <%Javaa01> Do a flip!
[2:25:16] <+liquidzr0> go get the magical sword Makoto
[2:25:18] <%Amaideus> I've been saving it

[2:34:04] <Rafraud> TIME TO STEAL
[2:34:05] <Ahk_90> Patches is love, Patches is life, Patches is UNBREAKABLE
[2:34:10] <Blank9> he definitely got caught with a mask on breaking into your home to steal stuff, but he didn't ever screw you on a deal
[2:34:13] <%cache_22> Patches would call the police on you as you walk away from the deal.
[2:34:14] <+chiazam> DOESNT IT LOOK SO COOOOL
[2:34:17] <LunarRemix> Zero scalling
[2:34:23] <%Javaa01> But ZERO scaling

[2:35:37] <linSP> makoto is a good early weapon but falls off late game

[2:43:36] <andre11dr> I just can't wait for Reggie to experience Bloodborne
[2:43:37] <alroy900> @BallerSwagBro9k it was unfinished content in the original game, and the remake didn't want to create new things without fromsoft, so they didn't make it.
[2:43:38] <Blank9> and then you ultimately do all whips Belmont run in 2/3 until you can do it
[2:43:39] <+liquidzr0> DS has claimed another one
[2:43:44] <DatAsuna> well not a life time xD
[2:43:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dark Souls 1 when?
[2:43:55] <%jonblnt> ELDIN RING COMING UP
[2:43:56] <rysku> ''a couple years''

[2:44:11] <DatAsuna> I would not make a souls game my desert island game

[2:44:25] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will do a Pat and be like "I'm doing Elden Ring it's MINE"
[2:44:26] <supergoblinpunch> Even then there's self imposed challenge runs
[2:44:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Illusory Wall

[2:45:09] <OokamiDen02> Make Reggie VS DS1 happen please
[2:45:11] <%Frazzyfraznor> DS3 still looks good
[2:45:13] <%Javaa01> You could upgrade the sword too
[2:45:18] <alroy900> @BallerSwagBro9k yeah I know, they wanted to make it as faithful to the original,i would have liked if they made it personaly tho

[2:46:26] <%Frazzyfraznor> BB still looks good, but that 30fps sucks
[2:46:33] <%Deekman> did he buy it?
[2:46:40] <Rafraud> Jump off the nearest cliff
[2:46:43] <Johannen> @Rafraud Its the ugliest version of DS1, Switch version or Original DS1 with DSfix looks 10x times better, that "remaster" killed the visuals
[2:46:45] <LunarRemix> Kill drops are still kill drops
[2:46:45] <Darren716> DS1 is the greatest of all time for 75% of it
[2:46:49] <DatAsuna> plinko like it's shenmue 3
[2:46:53] <Prevot> 30fps AND bad frame pacing, also the game looks jaggy as fuck
[2:47:14] <mrblack499> is nioh on the table i dont remember
[2:47:27] <Darren716> Is DS1 original still available on Steam?
[2:47:28] <DatAsuna> @mrblack499 *makes eh shaky hand gesture*
[2:47:33] <Darren716> Or is it just remastered?
[2:47:34] <+Colby_DJ> if a game doesn't look good in motion, does it look good?

[2:52:12] <VoraciousKain> just say the name, woolie won't get spoiled
[2:52:14] <%RaziWraith> the dragons in Demon Souls are super cheesy though. Not like you can lure them onto a bridge for melee.

[2:54:39] <PrideOfFiddles> Reggie the Rad
[2:54:41] <BlackermanZX> oh no
[2:54:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> for some reason I always sucked at the mid parry two-hand
[2:54:50] <hazeprojekt> the best is barehanded backstab and parry animation
[2:54:59] <DatAsuna> I prefer a good short sword or spear but yeah the weeb aesthetic is popular
[2:55:18] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Can't kill where they are resting, but I'm not sure you want to tell Reggie?
[2:55:32] <andre11dr> @datasuna What about the Penetrating Sword
[2:55:40] <%jonblnt> how much Reggie has grown
[2:55:44] <andre11dr> That's like anti short

[3:00:34] <ShortAssRibs> Nice try tho
[3:00:36] <OokamiDen02> yes, by pewpewing them
[3:00:39] <VoraciousKain> not enough magic
[3:00:47] <whiteblacklight74> throw magic at it
[3:00:56] <brunoberserk> yes
[3:00:59] <%RaziWraith> Yeah you can't kill the dragons without range
[3:00:59] <%ZweihanderSteve> mahou reggie
[3:01:00] <BlackermanZX> you can kill it with range or melee on the bridge iirc
[3:01:02] <%Javaa01> Reggie has a fair amount of Spice
[3:01:09] <andre11dr> I haven't ever seen a horse with wings and scales but hey i could be wrong
[3:01:10] <ronin19xx> 200 arrow method
[3:01:19] <+CAPSLOCKlive> 35 mins and a ton of arrows
[3:01:21] <KaiserMario> or both?
[3:01:22] <brunoberserk> crescent falchion can regen your mp
[3:01:28] <%Parapattern> Infinite Arrow Works
[3:01:42] <DatAsuna> like 200+ arrows
[3:01:50] <mrblack499> thank you
[3:01:51] <velgaduere> why did he eat the grass lavrenHmm
[3:02:00] <velgaduere> ain't that the expensive stuff?
[3:02:29] <+CAPSLOCKlive> it's more of a "i did it" than a "the rewards tho!" thing
[3:02:54] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, he'll prolly get pWT if he kills it
[3:03:04] <BurdRightsActivist> Fragrant Ring and Ring of Magical Sharpness
[3:03:09] <bigungabungas> are you also waiting for gg
[3:03:10] <BlackermanZX> you can melee the red dragon. Don't know about the blue one
[3:03:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Woolie explain it better, cause Reggie thinks he needs to force him to fly away here and only htne move down
[3:03:20] <%RaziWraith> doesn't he have crescent falchion for the mp regen?
[3:03:26] <ShortAssRibs> OR use hyper-mode
[3:03:31] <%RaziWraith> it would be less costly than arrow spam
[3:04:00] <eldragon_1> @woolieversus you can hit it with a great sword in the second zone,as it swoops down the bridge
[3:04:05] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Did reggie equiped the fire ring?
[3:04:13] <DelightfulDead> Stupid and unrelated to anything question; Woolie, are you fluent in French?
[3:04:17] <DatAsuna> when's demon's souls master quest?
[3:04:19] <%jonblnt> isn't there a red phantom in this area too

[3:04:46] <%RaziWraith> moves that head around too much LUL
[3:04:49] <DatAsuna> this is why the bow is superior

[3:06:28] <%cache_22> Reggarth likes his room messy.
[3:06:29] <DatAsuna> If you don't edge the limit you won't hit it so often
[3:06:35] <andre11dr> but what if he needs it tho
[3:06:40] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus summon some chat help for that
[3:06:43] <linSP> you can magic spam red dragon on 1-2
[3:06:48] <BlackermanZX> no theres a safe spot
[3:06:54] <dundore77> i went big boy with my first playthough. purple shield that big armor you can get from the 1-1 white tendency and cleaver. i did not roll and tanked everything
[3:06:54] <DatAsuna> that's the rhythm game strategy
[3:07:01] <mrblack499> just dont
[3:07:35] <Blank9> hundreds of minute
[3:07:52] <BlackermanZX> it doesn't take that much with the sword strategy
[3:07:58] <+robertoszek> LUL
[3:07:59] <KINGRAY898> whats good everyone
[3:08:07] <LunarRemix> It's really heavy though
[3:08:09] <DatAsuna> Imagine bringing 1 arrow less than you need lol
[3:08:36] <andre11dr> Storm Ruler can come pretty handy in 3-2
[3:08:42] <%Deekman> killing that dragon takes about 130 arrows
[3:08:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> end of an ERA
[3:08:54] <twoto858> Thanks for the carry
[3:09:00] <pmda2126> wow 😣
[3:09:29] <BlackermanZX> stormruler is more useful for manta farming
[3:09:31] <Blank9> it's not good for bones
[3:09:41] <Johannen> Meat Cleaver is NOT good for bones
[3:10:24] <dundore77> it does enough damage that it doesn't matter
[3:10:43] <LunarRemix> Change shields back Reggie
[3:10:56] <DatAsuna> I got most of my arrows from that 4-2 vendor
[3:10:56] <BurdRightsActivist> Blessed +5 Weapon, Adjudicator Shield, and Regen Ring absolutely slap
[3:11:04] <%patriotrenegade> I can't believe they're making a new Mortal Kombat movie without the guy who played Shang Tsung
[3:11:16] <andre11dr> Also after he does 1-3 he will get access to the best buffs in the game, so there's even more damage coming his way
[3:11:21] <BurdRightsActivist> wait what, really? That sucks
[3:11:31] <%patriotrenegade> I hope Kano is Australian

[3:11:53] <%jonblnt> i forgot we have poison mist
[3:11:56] <LunarRemix> But Poison Cloud has one really good gimmick though
[3:11:57] <DatAsuna> poison is for danger bois
[3:12:05] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Can Reggie use the White Bow? it does 100 dmg, and the Red Dragon has 1340 HP, so you can kill him with 14 arrows, less with stronger arrows
[3:12:12] <Johannen> Most Status Ailments are for PvP mostly
[3:12:13] <%patriotrenegade> Poison is for Old King Doran

[3:14:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Eat those beans
[3:14:18] <PrideOfFiddles> You got the good stuff
[3:14:21] <VoraciousKain> havel ring
[3:14:21] <andre11dr> I think it's just some souls
[3:14:22] <%jonblnt> 5k is nothing reggie
[3:14:24] <BlackermanZX> 5k souls is nothing at this point
[3:14:29] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus it's "ring of great strength"
[3:14:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> isn't there another ring???
[3:14:42] <DatAsuna> 2 rings
[3:14:47] <pmda2126> get it
[3:14:55] <PrideOfFiddles> OH 2?! :O now i remember
[3:14:58] <linSP> Havel ring is essential if you want some armor or heavy weapon
[3:15:04] <hazeprojekt> ring is under dragon tail correct?
[3:15:09] <VoraciousKain> yes
[3:15:18] <VoraciousKain> the last item there

[3:16:02] <DatAsuna> Honestly I don't think ring of great strenght is worth the slot normally, but for Reggie specifically yeah maybe
[3:16:44] <andre11dr> Yea sadly Reggie probably won't see the assassination quests because his caracter tendency will most likely stay white

[3:29:22] <DazzlingFuhrer> Tremendous downgrade
[3:29:26] <peachy996> It's the one redesign I don't like
[3:29:28] <pennykettle_> wait wtf why do I remember them having painted white faces, not black?
[3:29:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> me @ this entire game's visual design changes
[3:29:45] <%kewlmyc> Real talk. Easily the worst redesign in the game.
[3:29:53] <andre11dr> They used to look like some weird Alice in Wonderland shit
[3:30:06] <%krispen_wa> second worst redesign being the witch set
[3:30:19] <BurdRightsActivist> @pennykettle_ Lighting is funky in OG release, so I don't blame you
[3:30:21] <chaos4ever181> If they cleaned up the suit and kept the crazy grin I would be fine with it
[3:30:22] <%HeroToxiko> @andre11dr that explains the legal distinctification
[3:30:29] <Rafraud> I have only played the remake but I just looked it up and yeah I'd agree
[3:30:41] <chaos4ever181> It's not bad, but better than Satsuki
[3:30:51] <%krispen_wa> oh god satsuki
[3:30:59] <%Parapattern> "Inconceivably cruel"
[3:31:24] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:31:25] <%Amaideus> It's to maximize the chances of landing a blade
[3:31:34] <Chimeraelite> I mean that's a legitimate African weapon isn't it?
[3:31:35] <peachy996> Throw a mess of sharp iron, it's a dagger somehow
[3:31:35] <chaos4ever181> New Satsuki also has this weird shine on his face. Like he washed himself in oil before arriving

[3:32:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:32:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that almost sounded like Reggie is playing on a fightstick
[3:33:00] <$thomassolorio> the thoughing knifes are based of african thoughing knife used for war and hunting
[3:33:12] <+Undenizen> did you know sephiroth's sword is a real ass weapon?
[3:33:16] <%Frazzyfraznor> Maybe I'm strange, but i played the original and none of the redesigns bother me. They feel like two different games
[3:33:17] <%Noonoox12> @thomassolorio throwing?
[3:33:21] <ainda_> @woolieversus that throwing daggers is a legit designed based on throwing knives used by the Mangbetu people from the northeastermn Congo. look up "Mambele"
[3:33:33] <ainda_> looks weird but it works
[3:33:33] <$thomassolorio> throwing thank you
[3:33:34] <%krispen_wa> sephiroths sword is just Kojiro's Washing Pole
[3:33:36] <peachy996> The only one that bugs me if Fat Official
[3:33:43] <peachy996> I like the new Mindflayers

[3:34:31] <%isBumblebear> Howdy Woolie! Been a fan for a long-ass time and honestly should've dropped some gift subs sooner. Can only do two for now, but will definitely try and drop some more in the future! Keep kicking ass dude!

[3:35:01] <linSP> reggie vs reggie
[3:35:04] <andre11dr> Wasn't Washing Pole kinda bad ,like it would break easier or something
[3:35:18] <%Amaideus> Washing pole is good, but all katanas have low durability
[3:35:21] <RamenRiderZ> Kevin McAllister over here pushing down boulders
[3:35:22] <brunoberserk> @KeiganOfAstora wait REALLY ?
[3:35:28] <andre11dr> I meant irl
[3:35:32] <brianthe12th> has he beaten the penetrator yet
[3:35:32] <%Amaideus> Oh
[3:35:34] <%Amaideus> Probably
[3:35:41] <%krispen_wa> it got beat by a fucking rowing oar so yeah washing pole kinda sucked
[3:36:17] <andre11dr> Washing Pole was annoying as fuck to fight against in DS2 and DS3
[3:36:27] <RamenRiderZ> Washing Pole looks like it could be snapped by a gentle breeze
[3:36:34] <linSP> the 1-3 penetrator sword is so hard to find, at least you get one in 1-4 but that’s literally the last level
[3:36:51] <Rafraud> Welcome to the fuck pit
[3:36:55] <KaiserMario> Oh... Mickey Blue eyes huh? I didn't know Woolie was into romcoms
[3:36:56] <CoffeeSlice> YEYYEYEYYEYYEYEYEYEYEYE

[3:37:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea
[3:37:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah 1-3 is fantastic
[3:37:32] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @KeiganOfAstora

[4:01:36] <%Amaideus> I mean now the reggie lorebook is "Yeah remember that time Reggie just stood there while his friend screamed for help"
[4:01:37] <%Deekman> Reggie would've been the guy that killed the prince
[4:01:38] <linSP> but how open door??
[4:01:57] <DatAsuna> why would that be the thing? xD
[4:01:58] <ManlyMcBeefington> Ostava said open the gate
[4:02:09] <Rafraud> You have a hard 30 seconds to solve that puzzle
[4:02:16] <CoffeeSlice> DOOR STUCK
[4:02:20] <%ekodrop> KEY
[4:02:22] <Rafraud> DOOR STUCK
[4:02:27] <dundore77> you sent everything to inventory
[4:02:27] <%emperordread> If Reggie kills the prince, do we give him the nickname "Reggicide"?
[4:02:30] <+Grayhammatter> a key
[4:02:34] <Blank9> you have a LOT of arrows taking up space
[4:02:47] <CoffeeSlice> @emperordread LUL
[4:02:53] <hazeprojekt> arrows are heavy since youre not using them
[4:03:00] <%Amaideus> I tried to get Reggiecide a thing during Dokapon
[4:03:03] <%notsoy> dump the new moon grass, too heavy and the others heal you enough
[4:03:07] <MidnightSnack69> hehehehe reggicide sofieSmooshier
[4:03:20] <DatAsuna> yeah that's a lot of junk not in the trunk
[4:03:45] <DSD24> I love this Purple Shield
[4:03:51] <DSD24> Its so cool
[4:03:51] <andre11dr> !uptime
[4:03:51] <%ekodrop> woolie gonna have to help reggie with these two, they're kinda not intuitive
[4:03:51] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 19 minutes
[4:03:54] <dundore77> is there a good reason why reggies keeping storm ruler? i get the knockback but is there something he should try to knockback?
[4:03:55] <velgaduere> beautiful
[4:04:10] <andre11dr> That's enough time to do the fight
[4:04:21] <DatAsuna> 90% wasn't enoughfor that guy
[4:04:34] <linSP> purple shield is how you walk through lava, just hold the shield up
[4:04:36] <%Javaa01> But it weighs a shitload
[4:04:44] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[4:04:46] <velgaduere> that 10% is ALL a dragon needs
[4:05:05] <Neoripo> He was saving it for later
[4:05:05] <PrideOfFiddles> The only thing that counters dragons in this game are 200 arrows
[4:05:06] <hazeprojekt> tell reggie puple shield is no parry shield
[4:05:31] <LunarRemix> Magic is always an option

[4:07:26] <%Amaideus> Nah you can do 1-4 after you get any archdemon soul IIRC
[4:07:29] <%krispen_wa> @rafraud you still need all the great demon souls
[4:07:33] <BurdRightsActivist> Disguise
[4:07:37] <pennykettle_> That's one of the most interesting lore bits. These guys just suddenly showed up one day and started scmoozing the king and brought the demons back
[4:07:37] <%Amaideus> But narratively speaking I'd say it's best left for last
[4:07:43] <andre11dr> @asuterisuku Wat gave yoy problems?
[4:07:55] <%krispen_wa> @rafraud to end the game. 1-4 is available after 1-3 at any time

[4:29:37] <%RaziWraith> Yes, chat he put ALL the pieces away.
[4:30:13] <%Deekman> i totally missed that on my first play through
[4:30:14] <pennykettle_> That's something most players aren't even meant to know to do. It's a secret
[4:30:24] <velgaduere> I really, truly don't think photo mode did anything more for him than seeing him at some obscure angle would have
[4:30:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:30:44] <andre11dr> I do love how Woolie watched him putting ALL of it away and didn't say shit ,what a dick LUL

[4:31:14] <andre11dr> That too
[4:31:21] <%Asuterisuku> He did it exactly correctly.
[4:31:30] <%ChoculaUltra> it is a p sweet hat
[4:31:32] <Rafraud> I'll give him the solve cause even seeing the official without bed crumbs its still super hard to know what to do
[4:31:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is a large zone
[4:31:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Were there any shortcuts to the boss?
[4:31:44] <user_naim> So Pat just ”beat” Bionic Commando on Capcom’s Stream

[4:43:08] <%A_German_spy> @Rafraud Higher stat requirements, generally. Not a serious cost
[4:43:14] <Rafraud> Ah okay lol

[4:45:26] <+Strigiform> firestorm so good they had to nerf it every game after
[4:45:41] <linSP> firestorm is good after a backstab
