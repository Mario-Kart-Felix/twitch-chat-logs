[0:23:20] <+ALazo> warm. Can't stand the cold. Also shoveling snow in the winter or just wiping it off my windshield before driving to work is the worst
[0:23:21] <%yusefHD> You can layer clothes on, but you can't fuckin de-heat.
[0:23:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SAME WOOLZ
[0:23:23] <%j0hnnydonuts> humidity is absolute trash
[0:23:25] <@Menitta> @MrPedrovsky Its completely its own thing. 0 overlap with Yakuza other than Kamurocho.
[0:23:25] <+McSoliace> i'm the exact opposite
[0:23:25] <TreesDontTalk> I have lived in both. If warm, it depends on how damn humid it is. For cold, you can definitely have better summers and falls.
[0:23:28] <%Terrarp> Rather cozy than be naked and sweaty
[0:23:30] <OldOnyx> warm > cold but Freezing > Cooking

[0:35:10] <+MoistHeinous> @atomicgodz suicide rates in alaska is mostly contributed to lack of sunlight not necessarily the cold weather
[0:35:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @lazysaiyajin in my hometown in France theres a rounabout and intersection that was under construction for nearly 10 year because the funds were used by Town Hall for "something else"

[1:01:09] <Project205> ok so you just weong
[1:01:10] <Daxalog> Ascending or Descending?
[1:01:14] <@Menitta> Interesting
[1:01:14] <DatAsuna> That's gonna upset some folks
[1:01:17] <Project205> *wrong
[1:01:23] <black_pariah> halo 1 that far down?
[1:01:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> does V mean up or down?
[1:01:30] <Bushin_ryu_cat> At least you added Reach
[1:01:32] <Cykron> Yeah that's extremely spicy, almost inetible take
[1:01:33] <+D00msDayDan> Halo 4 definitely plays like an upgrade of reach but wow it botched everything else
[1:01:39] <+yhom_tork> man I wish they gave halo 1 the blur treatment
[1:01:39] <DigitalJoshie> Halo 4 is a good game
[1:01:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> when halo 2 no1 i guess descending
[1:01:47] <DelgotHansto> I havent even watched the Halo LPs yet or played the games and I'm fuming
[1:01:48] <+lazysaiyajin> GUN GOOD
[1:01:48] <DatAsuna> 4 is a game with a lot of cool elements I wish it delivered on,
[1:01:50] <+BoBoGaijin> the multiplayer for reach was the big thing for me, the campaign was kinda ok
[1:01:53] <Bushin_ryu_cat> He forgot the RTS games for Halo
[1:01:54] <%ekodrop> can we just say that killzone is the best halo game and all be friends
[1:01:58] <@Menitta> Does it make it better or worse if irs ascending
[1:02:05] <DatAsuna> 4 has a bomb ass soundtrack, but it uses said songs so awfully it squanders them
[1:02:06] <@Menitta> @ekodrop no
[1:02:10] <Bushin_ryu_cat> Halo Wars
[1:02:11] <$HaunchPaunch> Halo 2 is #1, everything else is subjective.
[1:02:22] <DelgotHansto> Here we go
[1:02:23] <Wheelskelet10> If only you could just retire wheneber you wanted from the military
[1:02:41] <+Aldesso> Woolie and situational Awareness. Name greater enemies
[1:02:52] <%Irridium> not wrong
[1:02:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> ascending is worst first right?
[1:03:04] <+yhom_tork> oh shit I should play that
[1:03:07] <@Menitta> Ascending would mean worst first
[1:03:16] <jorniev> is this a castle?
[1:03:19] <+D00msDayDan> Halo wars 2 also ends on a tie-in to halo 5

[1:25:52] <DelgotHansto> Metal 1 is the best
[1:25:57] <DatAsuna> the best is yet to come
[1:25:59] <shadowcrisis> Zero
[1:26:12] <%wibbwobbler> pretty cool 4 a cod
[1:26:17] <Darren716> Wasn't Metal 1 the US group in MW3?
[1:26:17] <+Aldesso> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[1:26:23] <+yhom_tork> thats strong
[1:26:36] <SpaceGuntank> there isnt even any combat yet, put the shield down man
[1:26:40] <DelgotHansto> People were still on the ship lol
[1:26:44] <%mundanelotus> Woolie just aim man lol
[1:26:55] <shadowcrisis> It's time to drop massive Cleveland steamers on everyone chest
[1:26:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:27:12] <+yhom_tork> woolie can only hipfire
[1:27:49] <Darren716> I feel the shield taught Woolie some bad lessons about playing cod
[1:27:50] <skeletonknifefight> that robot had a family
[1:27:50] <%jiggy_snipe> more war crimes
[1:27:51] <+EdenOfLove> HE HAD A NAME WOOLIE
[1:28:02] <DelgotHansto> Dark Souls 2 could have been 20 parts shorter is the shield recharged like it does here
[1:28:08] <+EdenOfLove> HE HAD HOPES, DREAMS, AND... what am I kidding it's a fucking bot.
[1:28:10] <%AngryAsian5> TACTICAL COLLISION
[1:28:14] <andre11dr> That robot had a family
[1:28:30] <skeletonknifefight> family-amily-amily
[1:28:35] <Daxalog> Olympus Mons huh?
[1:28:38] <shadowcrisis> @DelgotHansto then it would not be a souls game
[1:28:40] <Graxe_> Ramming speed
[1:28:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS THE WAY
[1:28:55] <+D00msDayDan> I’ve got the mass
[1:29:04] <DelgotHansto> Why are they just out here
[1:29:07] <+yhom_tork> no shield lmao
[1:29:12] <+Aldesso> this is what happens when you only rely on shield for target aquisition
[1:29:18] <skeletonknifefight> in space no one can hear you drop shield
[1:29:19] <%mundanelotus> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[1:29:25] <@Solidus_113> hard whiffs
[1:29:27] <SpaceGuntank> the Anti-Woolie Area LUL
[1:29:32] <Atomicgodz> tfw you use the shield so much he forgets he can use the left trigger
[1:29:35] <shadowcrisis> in space, you dont have to fear taking a deuce
[1:29:36] <jorniev> calm down
[1:29:39] <+Firemane1279> Woolie confirmed can't aim or learn to FPS. Keepo LUL
[1:29:44] <+yhom_tork> antiwoolie tech
[1:29:47] <Darren716> Turns out Woolie's soul is held down by gravity
[1:30:13] <+MoxaHaunt> @aldesso I've been here for a while and you've done nothing but bitch
[1:30:14] <X2Eliah> Let's be fair, Woolie's TV is very far away and its very hard to see small targets like that.
[1:30:14] <+Aldesso> he probabaly could have learned it over the course of this game but he had to use the shield

[1:44:32] <FreedomARX7> Gundam IBO
[1:44:33] <DelgotHansto> Red Green Blue Mars
[1:44:35] <Nekros4442> Mars in Warhammer 40k is the factory for the rest of the Empire
[1:44:37] <+D00msDayDan> Warhammer 40k
[1:44:41] <jorniev> MARS REPLACED EARTGH IN THAT
[1:44:43] <heartlesshealer> oh great
[1:44:45] <+Doc1790> Futurama Mars is fun
[1:44:46] <X2Eliah> The Mars trilogy by K.S. Robinson?
[1:44:51] <DelgotHansto> Yeah
[1:44:59] <DelgotHansto> Big good Mars is the best
[1:44:59] <Psyramics> How is Griff out here without a helmet? How cold is out there?
[1:45:01] <Cykron> Griff must be cold, he's only wearing an oxygen mask
[1:45:08] <+OmegaWeltall> i would say Warhammer 40K but EVERYTHING's shit in 40k
[1:45:10] <jorniev> THE EXPANSE, those martians are op
[1:45:15] <Atomicgodz> Red Faction has the people in control as bad but the rebels are good
[1:45:30] <%Frostycone00> Weren't the aliens in Mission To Mars good guys?
[1:45:32] <heartlesshealer> does mars have enough atmosphere to retain heat at this point or what?
[1:45:32] <+D00msDayDan> 3 for 3 shot burst
[1:45:41] <shadowcrisis> chairGross
[1:45:51] <DelgotHansto> Mars is completely terraformed in this universe
[1:45:58] <%LavenderLaser> LavenderLaser subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Call of Duty: Tekketsu no Orphans
[1:45:59] <DelgotHansto> Well atmosphere wise
[1:45:59] <heartlesshealer> cool
[1:46:15] <DelgotHansto> But its like Killzone where the air is super siht
[1:46:28] <heartlesshealer> then livable temperature is plausible at least
[1:46:48] <Siebersboy> atleast its... red?
[1:47:01] <X2Eliah> Scenic.
[1:47:05] <%LavenderLaser> Mars is livable because we can just put a red filter on our desert environment textures from modern warfare
[1:47:07] <jorniev> why is it only dessert if its terraformed
[1:47:18] <Siebersboy> its bad terraforming
[1:47:19] <+MrProw> mars wasn't that terrible in iron blooded orphans
[1:47:19] <skeletonknifefight> griff aint give a shit
[1:47:22] <+MrProw> it was just bad
[1:47:23] <andre11dr> Well Mars at least has the most important human resource, waters
[1:47:25] <ToneBacas> at least he's wearing a mask
[1:47:25] <akman14> In summer it gets up to 20C
[1:47:29] <X2Eliah> -136?
[1:47:32] <DelgotHansto> Its terraformed guys
[1:47:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[1:47:37] <jorniev> LOOK at the uv lamps
[1:47:38] <heartlesshealer> okay t-shirt no, fuck that
[1:47:40] <Atomicgodz> rolled up sleeves lmao
[1:47:40] <+lazysaiyajin> all drugs
[1:47:43] <@Menitta> -81 C
[1:47:43] <%Frubblord> The mars in this universe is terraformed
[1:47:52] <%PkSilent01> -69 F in Imperials
[1:47:52] <heartlesshealer> dust tear his arm up
[1:47:53] <Cykron> But how terriformed is it if you can't even breath the air?
[1:47:53] <andre11dr> Like -100 som
[1:47:58] <DelgotHansto> Martians don't even need the face mask
[1:47:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:59] <X2Eliah> -60 C oh that's just like Montreal then
[1:48:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @menitta just a slight chill then
[1:48:03] <+MrProw> griff is just like those guys who go out in -20C in shorts
[1:48:06] <%AngryAsian5> I'm assuming Mars is livable in this context, there's probably some form of atmosphere here.
[1:48:08] <@Menitta> Oh I read that as C. -81 F
[1:48:09] <jorniev> MAYBE THE BLUE LAMPS HELP?
[1:48:11] <TigerClaws12> it's fine Kappa
[1:48:14] <Psyramics> Griff the true Canadian after all
[1:48:16] <@Menitta> yeah light t shirt
[1:48:19] <Siebersboy> its a slow process
[1:48:21] <DelgotHansto> You don't need the mask
[1:48:25] <DelgotHansto> Air just sucks
[1:48:33] <+burntbagels13> ice is water V
[1:48:36] <therealtacopancakes> it gets to 20c during the daylight I think
[1:48:47] <DelgotHansto> Martians live with it and is makees them stronger or something supposedly
[1:48:48] <@Menitta> Tbh, you JUST KNOW that if people lived on mars, they would be like "PFFFF THIS AINT COLD" trying to act tough
[1:48:49] <XeroSigmaPrime> Yea Im betting its livable for those that adapted over their lives, but it sucks normally
[1:48:54] <heartlesshealer> Dummies are in the dummy ship
[1:49:06] <Atomicgodz> solid line
[1:49:10] <Cykron> LIQUIIIIIIIIID

[1:49:25] <Daxalog> I dont know about you. But I think Water is kinda...based?
[1:49:26] <+Firemane1279> BIG H 2 O
[1:49:27] <%wibbwobbler> mars could actually use some global warming
[1:49:29] <Jashter18> Mars is wet and so is the Moon
[1:49:32] <+MrProw> it isn't water, it's vodka.
[1:49:33] <prime_name> NAAAKKEEED
[1:49:33] <+OmegaWeltall> thres organic compounds found in Venus' atmosphere

[2:09:12] <DelgotHansto> I means its basic good storytelling its alright
[2:09:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:09:16] <Cykron> It's not really pro war, it's just sorta "man war sucks but you know it's kinda cool sometimes"
[2:09:22] <Siebersboy> o7
[2:09:24] <jorniev> they kinda are

[2:10:00] <skeletonknifefight> war sucks but lasers are definitely very cool
[2:10:00] <Siebersboy> I mean think realistically about their situation, there is NO WAY they win this scott free
[2:10:04] <jorniev> THAT IS HOW space war is gonna be
[2:10:06] <Darren716> Why don't they just turn off the elevator?
[2:10:06] <andrewofbob> Is this the thing they’re building in Montreal?
[2:10:09] <%AngryAsian5> Always love a good suicide mission segment
[2:10:23] <%wibbwobbler> a literal elevator lol
[2:10:26] <+vaderxyz1970> You know a space elevator would take at least 2 days to clime up to that station
[2:10:38] <Siebersboy> no shut up future
[2:10:39] <heartlesshealer> Why does Ethan need to be strapped in? Does he get fucked up by rumble?
[2:10:50] <+IwishIwasTaylorSwift> just make is a space elevator hotel
[2:10:56] <DelgotHansto> If only you built up your S Ranks then everyone survives and peace is had
[2:11:01] <Daxalog> "you didnt win"
[2:11:17] <andrewofbob> Revolving space elevator restaurant
[2:11:27] <Hammatime8> Did he really just declare the area secure while you were standing right there?

[2:11:36] <Siebersboy> if they're gonna win make it pyrrhic
[2:11:38] <heartlesshealer> Surprise!

[2:13:48] <skeletonknifefight> somebody give that robot a medal
[2:13:56] <+wunp_fxs> a little
[2:14:00] <PrinceOfEden> Did no one just think, "Wait I have a gun, I could just SHOOT IT IN THE FRIGGIN' HEAD."
[2:14:02] <$jake5713> Rogue. One.
[2:14:03] <DelgotHansto> She completed her character arc if anyone realised though
[2:14:03] <+vaderxyz1970> They need to one up Reach
[2:14:03] <%ekodrop> a little a lot
[2:14:03] <+OmegaWeltall> you shut up with tour logic V DansGame
[2:14:04] <andrewofbob> That’s pretty much the opening of Cod: AW
[2:14:04] <%mundanelotus> didnt it just open on its own
[2:14:07] <jorniev> cant you destroy the robots before they blow up?
[2:14:08] <Cykron> Stupid things happen in war
[2:14:08] <DelgotHansto> or cares
[2:14:11] <Siebersboy> do you really think they're thinking straight right now though
[2:14:13] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[2:14:16] <andrewofbob> AKA cod Spacey but not space
[2:14:33] <TigerClaws12> way to sell that the army is filled with idiots, gang
[2:14:38] <DSD24> @Siebersboy They still had a gun to shoot the robot
[2:14:38] <jorniev> SPACE RUSSIANS
[2:14:39] <X2Eliah> Eventually, the only survivor will the the gun
[2:14:42] <andre11dr> Just be smart 4Head
[2:14:55] <ToneBacas> don't eat the crayons
[2:14:57] <Siebersboy> DSD24 they had to hold the thing open
[2:15:07] <Hammatime8> Did you see that dude's rad AF Isaac Clarke helmet?
[2:15:21] <jorniev> HE LOOKED COOL
[2:15:27] <+MoxaHaunt> A lot of these deaths are almost comical
[2:15:29] <%SirGO0SE> PULL THE LEVER
[2:15:30] <Hammatime8> Why can the "good guys" never get rad helmets?
[2:15:38] <DelgotHansto> Massive pull but its actually like a straight rip off of the rachet gladiator helmet
[2:15:44] <andrewofbob> She fucked up
[2:15:54] <DSD24> @Hammatime8 Cause they gotta have their dumb human face
[2:16:20] <skeletonknifefight> because nazis had spooky skull hats and all military fiction pulls from ww2 in one way or another
[2:16:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:16:31] <Siebersboy> yeah you are NOT getting out of this
[2:16:32] <Hammatime8> @DSD24 Man, humans ruin everything :/
[2:16:43] <X2Eliah> Damn he's straight up ordering them to suicide.
[2:16:46] <DSD24> @Hammatime8 The epitome of this is Killzone
[2:16:56] <%mundanelotus> I never noticed Reyes starts growing stubble
[2:16:56] <+yhom_tork> no kill yourselves tho
[2:17:00] <+vaderxyz1970> I need you to one up Carter
[2:17:15] <ToneBacas> watch this cutscene plays again
[2:17:16] <X2Eliah> Is this a secret Spec Ops The Line sequel?
[2:17:30] <+kewlmyc> How long is this campaign?
[2:17:34] <Hammatime8> @DSD24 Those OG Helghast helmets were so GOOD
[2:17:35] <andrewofbob> This is a Shepherd without the loyalty missions done
[2:17:38] <%Josef_Stryker> Most war games would go the route of "The Men First" but this one is like "Stop caring so much, sacrifice your men for the mission"
[2:17:40] <%mundanelotus> peace to the fallen
[2:17:40] <$jake5713> It's almost like war forces you to make tough, irrational decisions...
[2:17:45] <Slothjoe> fair winds in space?
[2:17:49] <jorniev> GAIA ETERNUM
[2:17:53] <DeathByPoke7> they put you on the half life train
[2:18:00] <+BrainOneOhOne> solar winds
[2:18:02] <+wunp_fxs> such a 180
[2:18:07] <Siebersboy> war does that
[2:18:07] <X2Eliah> Last words of Cap'n Reyes: "Earf Aeternum!"
[2:18:08] <DSD24> @Hammatime8 The best was the Scout Look in Killzone 3 with the hood and Tri Light Helmet
[2:18:08] <DelgotHansto> This is like planetary genocide we are dealing with though
[2:18:10] <Daxalog> Its been rough
[2:18:12] <shadowcrisis> Space is one big Giant Toilet
[2:18:17] <skeletonknifefight> i mean its different when you're in the middle of enemy territory with no ships
[2:18:23] <%wibbwobbler> weeiirrd
[2:18:39] <Cykron> Desperate times, desperate measures and all that
[2:18:45] <jorniev> YUMMY AMO
[2:18:54] <jorniev> delicious ammo
[2:18:57] <DelgotHansto> If they don't Earth literally gets turned into a worldwide concentration camp I shit you not
[2:18:58] <DSD24> Wow that's bad
[2:19:01] <@Solidus_113> every time
[2:19:01] <%PkSilent01> Yay Warcrimes
[2:19:05] <Siebersboy> definitely that
[2:19:05] <%jiggy_snipe> that
[2:19:06] <Darren716> Seeker
[2:19:09] <andre11dr> Well, when you lose really hard ,you kinda start doubting yourself
[2:19:11] <brachydios777> Bomb is worse
[2:19:11] <nimu290> thats worse
[2:19:12] <%jiggy_snipe> seeker creates fear
[2:19:14] <shadowcrisis> Ya know, if we sent all of our Bio waste and garbage in space.....earth would be clean and healthier
[2:19:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Spec ops had the decency to have the fall progress slowly over days of conflict this guy falls less than half an hour
[2:19:16] <Vashido22> that one is fucking evil
[2:19:20] <andrewofbob> Donthelpjustfilm
[2:19:27] <+BrainOneOhOne> seekers would be terrifying
[2:19:31] <DSD24> Eraser is bad because there is nothing left afterwards
[2:19:33] <Hammatime8> Warcrimes and suicide missions! Go marines! Kappa
[2:19:40] <jorniev> yeah that one REALLLY lets you know you are dead
[2:19:52] <%ekodrop> killing all the halo mans
[2:20:06] <DSD24> What's worse the realization that you are about to die, or the other where no one could possibly know that you died
[2:20:11] <+MrProw> Eraser is more environment friendly
[2:20:31] <andrewofbob> Seekers are sadistic; they could have the explosive primed as they jump, but no; they gloat as they hug your neck
[2:21:14] <X2Eliah> Seekers feel like they are about 5,6 years from being reality.
[2:21:22] <%jepupu> Doesn't this game have lean-on-wall?
[2:21:23] <X2Eliah> I'm sure Boston Robotics is already on that

[2:22:34] <Hammatime8> Ethan is the fucking BEST
[2:22:37] <jorniev> JUST LET ROBBOTS WIN
[2:22:38] <%AngryAsian5> Maybe Ethan should have been in charge the whole time LUL
[2:22:51] <andrewofbob> It is ME3 suicide mission, but Ethan is Shepherd
[2:22:54] <Darren716> Know what Ethan should do? Just open up all the airlocks where enemies are right now
[2:22:58] <X2Eliah> Ethan is real proof that you want the homicidal omnipotent AI on your side
[2:23:00] <+clonexsniper> that fate is so much worst, getting vented and falling planetside
[2:23:07] <%Irridium> Ethan recorded that
[2:23:08] <skeletonknifefight> robots are watching!
[2:23:12] <%jiggy_snipe> "what an iditot lol" - Ethan probably
[2:23:34] <+vaderxyz1970> He also clipped it and uploaded it to spacebook for everyone
[2:23:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:23:43] <Hammatime8> Just a fucking CLOUD of blood

[2:24:38] <Hammatime8> Look ath that photograph?
[2:24:43] <jorniev> should woolie play metro 2033?
[2:24:57] <@Solidus_113> it'd be a neat LP
[2:24:58] <jorniev> naaah
[2:25:07] <jorniev> maybe too slow for him
[2:25:14] <@Solidus_113> it's stealth heavy
[2:25:18] <andrewofbob> Metro is very stealth
[2:25:19] <brachydios777> Now I’m thinking of Tommy’s Matchbook in Destiny 2 which is basically a Tommy gun that incinerates dudes when fires long enough
[2:25:20] <Daxalog> Quick scope that ak
[2:25:49] <skeletonknifefight> dauntless valor, generic enemy grunt
[2:25:57] <$jake5713> Why does Woolie hate the melee button?
[2:26:06] <andrewofbob> If you don’t stealth, you have firefights where you are outnumbered badly with similar power levels per man
[2:26:12] <Zebroneath> oh no
[2:26:15] <heartlesshealer> there's no time
[2:26:16] <X2Eliah> Literally kill Ethan

[2:34:11] <Darren716> We beat up Jon a bit then didn't kill him
[2:34:19] <Darren716> Also the fuck happened to Connor McGreggor?
[2:34:23] <@Menitta> So like that movie Her?
[2:34:23] <andre11dr> We either get Ethan, or we'll get AM
[2:34:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Joj died from his wounds

[2:37:20] <%mundanelotus> I'll be interested to see Woolie's reaction to Halo 4 Cortana
[2:37:25] <jorniev> AND NOW HALO 4
[2:37:26] <+McSoliace> tbf an ai is smarter than you
[2:37:26] <+D00msDayDan> Oh boy halo 4 is gonna be a time if that’s how he feels about Cortana
[2:37:27] <DelgotHansto> what if Cortana had Beowulf??
[2:37:36] <%AngryAsian5> Need to program every AI with humor.exe
[2:37:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:37:43] <%AngryAsian5> dammit
[2:37:44] <aluddss> better than human
[2:37:44] <X2Eliah> We will get to that snarkiness, IF apple/google find out that it leads to more advert sales or something

[2:38:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @jorniev I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS
[2:38:46] <$SilverRoddo> T800 is pretty cool
[2:38:47] <+Firemane1279> @jorniev I'unno. Quarians have some H I P S.
[2:38:48] <jorniev> GETH FUCKING RULE
[2:38:56] <jorniev> ONLY THE ONE
[2:38:58] <%SilverDevilfish> So all of Earth got fucked by ONE part of Mars.
[2:39:00] <Darren716> Fuck Quarians, rule the Geth? Sounds good to me
[2:39:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @firemane1279 ah a fellow person of culture
[2:39:10] <+D00msDayDan> A red faction, perhaps? Guerillas among them?
[2:39:19] <+Firemane1279> @ballerswagbro9k SeemsGood
[2:39:24] <X2Eliah> Tbh when it comes to planet vs. planet, all you need is one guy, one rocket, and an asteroid from out of the dark.
[2:39:31] <jorniev> @BallerSwagBro9k i can agree to this
[2:39:46] <+McSoliace> you would love ace combat then
[2:39:50] <DelgotHansto> More pop up after you do Griff
[2:40:15] <heartlesshealer> 'kay griff
[2:40:21] <Nekros4442> It's a final message in case they died
[2:40:33] <brachydios777> How do you guys feel about Ghost (Nolan boy) in Destiny 2?
[2:40:44] <X2Eliah> Would be nicer to have a full brain backup in the dogtag.
[2:40:54] <jorniev> wooow

[2:41:38] <%Josef_Stryker> Basically the same thing they did with that guy in NBA 2K16
[2:41:43] <DelgotHansto> I could have sworn more popped up huuh
[2:41:44] <jorniev> MORE POP UP HUH
[2:41:48] <@akuda_bar> hey look... the warfare stopped
[2:41:54] <DSD24> Vic van Vier
[2:42:06] <Zebroneath> I wanted shirtless fight in the rain with Jon.
[2:42:08] <%Josef_Stryker> There's a trophy for stabbing Jon Snow too
[2:42:11] <jorniev> john wick thouh
[2:42:14] <DelgotHansto> What about all the other iconic characters
[2:42:18] <DSD24> But its a knife
[2:42:34] <X2Eliah> Stabbing jon snow would do nothing though, he'd just come back to life
[2:42:40] <Pomer> Kevin Spacey gets FUCKED at the end of his game
[2:42:43] <%mundanelotus> angela bassett
[2:42:47] <%mundanelotus> ?
[2:42:55] <DelgotHansto> ROBERT ENGLAND IN ZOMBIES
[2:42:57] <@Menitta> They used to be just voice actors. Like whats his name from Walking Dead played a guy in BLOPs 2
[2:42:59] <DelgotHansto> Hes the fucking best
[2:43:04] <@Menitta> Oh yeah and Zombies
[2:43:05] <resloxxx> This feels will not make me forget how they did ethan dirty and didnt add him to the memorial
[2:43:06] <brachydios777> Modern warfare and Black ops have more memorable characters
[2:43:09] <Darren716> Most of them are QTE's
[2:43:09] <jorniev> ALL ARE SLOW MO SHOOT
[2:43:11] <DelgotHansto> Playing himself as well
[2:43:15] <+D00msDayDan> You kill Kevin spacey yourself at the end of AW
[2:43:21] <%AngryAsian5> Tbh, I kinda liked the way they killed the main villain here. In every other COD game, there's always a protracted fight scene with the main villain.
[2:43:21] <%mundanelotus> the ending kinda ruined this story for me
[2:43:26] <+MrProw> oh yeah there was david tennant in some cod zombies
[2:43:29] <X2Eliah> haha. Such a heartfelt "No"
[2:43:30] <+MrProw> in WW II i think
[2:43:32] <Darren716> MW3 you have a punch out then hanging a guy
[2:43:34] <MAX116030> boss LUL
[2:43:53] <Darren716> MW1 a slow-mow shootout against 3 guys
[2:43:54] <DelgotHansto> Robert DeNiro and Floyd Campell in Shadows of Evil
[2:43:57] <@Menitta> FUCK that
[2:43:59] <+wunp_fxs> oh fuuuck that
[2:44:01] <%ekodrop> re punch volcano rock
[2:44:04] <FreedomARX7> wa...
[2:44:05] <Hammatime8> Fuck that!
[2:44:06] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> MW3 ending mission using the juggernaut suit is so sick
[2:44:09] <+aishman> YEYE I SAW THAT SHIT TOO
[2:44:12] <Nekros4442> there's always some idiot
[2:44:13] <nmaten> just watch a movie
[2:44:15] <jorniev> smells likekotaku
[2:44:16] <@Menitta> I think I remember that
[2:44:21] <DSD24> Game overs are the failure of the game creator
[2:44:22] <Darren716> I wish the juggernaut section in MW3 lasted longer
[2:44:23] <MAX116030> most likely kotaku
[2:44:29] <SpaceGuntank> it was Kotaku that wrote that article, i remember it.
[2:44:32] <SomersaultJustice> i think it was kotaku
[2:44:35] <Darren716> Should've been the whole mission not just the first part
[2:44:38] <@Menitta> Yakuza has killer boss fights

[2:44:52] <Daxalog> Like Myst and adventure games
[2:44:54] <TigerClaws12> hey look, ERF
[2:44:55] <%dreadedcthulhu> monster hunter says "well I guess ill just die huh"
[2:44:55] <jorniev> SOME TIMES BOSS FIGHTS are just a really good CONVERSATIONs
[2:45:15] <%mundanelotus> a jet fight would've been better
[2:45:20] <jorniev> YUP
[2:45:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sometimes boss fights are the best part of the game, like No More Heroes
[2:45:26] <X2Eliah> Boss fights can be good, but we gotta realize that you don't need the boss fight to lawyas be just one huge big dude
[2:45:28] <+MrProw> First Rage had bossfights in the game, but in the last stage there was a buildup and then fucking nothing
[2:45:29] <Sapphire_Breeze> finale of Witcher 2 was pretty cool
[2:45:40] <%Irridium> imagine the final fight of Devil May Cry 5 was just a fucking QTE or cutscene
[2:45:43] <jorniev> WITCHER 2 WAS GREAT
[2:45:46] <+Lolo27234> alot of FPs boss fights are more a big set pieces and bog down some shooters
[2:45:54] <jorniev> YEAAAAH
[2:45:58] <%wibbwobbler> bosses are the center pieces for Japanese games
[2:46:02] <+D00msDayDan> Shooter bosses are hard, they’re either bullet sponges or have really annoying damage mechanics
[2:46:05] <andre11dr> Half Life 1 anyone final boss as well
[2:46:06] <Pomer> @Sapphire_Breeze despite the fact that actually fighting Letho as Geralt with his memory back makes no sense
[2:46:08] <brachydios777> Monster Hunter has hard ass final bosses
[2:46:13] <andrewofbob> BlazBlue does boss fights in an interesting way without going full SNK boss
[2:46:15] <resloxxx> LUL
[2:46:16] <Darren716> I wonder how you'd even do a boss fight in your average CoD game
[2:46:17] <%Irridium> Boss Fights don't need to be combat based either. Remember the KOTOR 2 dialog boss fights? That shit was FIRE
[2:46:24] <Darren716> That isn't just a vehicle or something
[2:46:28] <MAX116030> If boss fight sucks its bad boss fight implementation not its existence bad
[2:46:29] <jorniev> OG DEUS EX had TERRIBLE boss fights TOO so it fits i guess
[2:46:29] <DelgotHansto> Vergil takes a shot of Venom and turns into a mega ripped Vergil against nERO
[2:46:39] <+FuqBoiSlim> @brachydios777 ceadeus in tri monkaS
[2:46:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Pomer true. I was more making a joke that a conversation with him is a satisfying "boss fight"
[2:46:44] <heartlesshealer> don't outsource boss fights unless you also outsource gameplay, holy shit
[2:46:50] <jorniev> REMEMBER NEW VEGAS
[2:46:56] <%Frostycone00> Boss fights a dependent on if the games are designed for it.
[2:47:01] <brachydios777> @fuqboislim FATALIS is no joke
[2:47:01] <Pomer> @Sapphire_Breeze oh yeah, you right. i guess i got a little caught up in the fact that fight even exists.
[2:47:05] <%kyh9> But TITANFALL 2 BOSS FIGHTS THO
[2:47:08] <%kyh9> GOOD SHIT
[2:47:11] <rockethed1> ^
[2:47:11] <+someyounguy1> levels are lessons bosses are tests. they culminate the skills and themes of the game.
[2:47:13] <andrewofbob> A final boss is a final test of your skills
[2:47:17] <+Lolo27234> and alot of shooter boss fights are just runing into a bullet spong thats it
[2:47:19] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Titan fall 2 yeyeye
[2:47:26] <jorniev> GOOOD GOOD SHIT that TITANFALL 2
[2:47:28] <andrewofbob> So CoD having final boss QTEs is quite fitting
[2:47:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> @brachydios777 which one bro there's like 3 versions
[2:47:33] <jorniev> SHADOW OF MORDOR
[2:47:37] <jorniev> LIKE WTF
[2:47:39] <Adam_Frostburn> Halo 4 FUCKING LOL
[2:47:41] <%JustYudha> Halo 4
[2:47:42] <+RyanTheRecluse> Halo 1 and the Maw is a great example of the last level being the boss fight
[2:47:42] <brachydios777> @fuqboislim World
[2:47:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> Imagine if No More Heroes had a qte final boss LUL
[2:47:54] <MAX116030> was that halo 4 ?
[2:48:07] <Apolonm> Like Kreia?
[2:48:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> @brachydios777 i haven't played iceborne yet but he does look hella tough there
[2:48:17] <%wibbwobbler> plenty of western games stumble towards final boss (batman, bioshock)
[2:48:24] <Pomer> @FuqBoiSlim frankly i'm shocked suda DIDN'T do that still, to this day.
[2:48:26] <DelgotHansto> hold the fuck on where were you going with Stanley Parable
[2:48:33] <+Lolo27234> god halo 4 is sutch a pain to go throw
[2:48:39] <ToneBacas> Dying Light end boss QTE
[2:48:51] <brachydios777> VERGIL
[2:48:52] <%ekodrop> resistance had boss fights
[2:48:57] <jorniev> @ToneBacas dlc has a boss fight
[2:48:59] <%mundanelotus> where did these songs even play lol
[2:49:02] <Darren716> The fuck Relax was in this game?
[2:49:03] <andre11dr> Dialogue bosses as well
[2:49:04] <Darren716> Where?
[2:49:05] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Now fight your rival
[2:49:06] <Chorkly> Godhand best of both worlds, last fight is you and last fight is also bowser.
[2:49:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> @pomer i think he likes video games too much to pass up a hype ass final boss tbh
[2:49:21] <Darren716> LUL
[2:49:21] <andre11dr> I love the Soul Cinder
[2:49:25] <brachydios777> LUL
[2:49:25] <%AngryAsian5> If there was ever a COD game that needed a sequel LUL
[2:49:27] <%zeejaymac> Infinite Warfare campaign was legit
[2:49:29] <+OmegaWeltall> fuck paying $60 for this game though
[2:49:31] <DelgotHansto> You bear the mark of the bear...
[2:49:31] <resloxxx> fuck the ending tho, they did my ethan dirty
[2:49:32] <Zebroneath> BUT ETHAN
[2:49:38] <Pomer> @FuqBoiSlim thankfully there are lines even our craziest cannot cross
[2:49:45] <Darren716> IW saying thanks to the people who didn't quit
[2:49:47] <+wunp_fxs> bad descision
[2:49:49] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:49:50] <DelgotHansto> So will you join the unity, or do you die here? JOIN DIE JOIN DIE
[2:49:54] <andre11dr> DS 2 final boss tho ,no thanks
[2:49:58] <heartlesshealer> no robots harmed? =T
[2:50:00] <+Lolo27234> alot of cod fans where not happy with this for there own pretty good resons
[2:50:00] <%Josef_Stryker> Both games suffered
[2:50:02] <Darren716> Is specialist the fucked hard one?
[2:50:07] <DelgotHansto> Yep
[2:50:08] <%mundanelotus> should he try zombies mode
[2:50:09] <MAX116030> I mean its to EA no activision
[2:50:11] <Darren716> Where you die in 1 hit?
[2:50:25] <brachydios777> I love Dark Souls 3’s final boss
[2:50:30] <X2Eliah> So next week, Woolie on modern warfare multiplayer?
[2:50:41] <andre11dr> EA and Activision don't think like that Woolie
[2:50:41] <DelgotHansto> Zombies in Spaceland now?
[2:50:52] <jorniev> YAKUZA 0
[2:50:54] <+D00msDayDan> It was respawn’s decision to go against cod, EA didn’t make them put it out in that window
[2:51:34] <Hammatime8> I haven't heard good things about Cold War, but hey, Whatcha gonna do?
[2:51:35] <Pomer> wait, they're still putting out stuff for infinite warfare?
[2:51:37] <jorniev> THE HAT
[2:51:48] <heartlesshealer> you CAN get swamp ass in the cold
[2:51:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:51:50] <Hammatime8> H A T
[2:51:55] <jorniev> CANADA HAT
[2:52:01] <+wunp_fxs> I can live with that
[2:52:03] <brachydios777> That and Frozen Nips
[2:52:06] <%mundanelotus> ass cheek stuck to seat
[2:52:10] <+KiboSenshi> i love the cold toilet seat
[2:52:11] <Dusty_Catz> If you always burn hot like me, winter swamp ass is very possible
[2:52:24] <agianttornado> whats going on with V?
[2:52:27] <heartlesshealer> metal toilet seat is the worst
[2:52:30] <%wibbwobbler> luvelyCringe
[2:52:35] <TigerClaws12> weeeeeb
[2:52:36] <+McSoliace> hell no
[2:52:47] <brachydios777> That snicker LUL
[2:52:49] <+McSoliace> that shit would destroy the channel
[2:53:05] <Darren716> Woolie you already played all the real Halos so you're done
[2:53:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> HAL OMEGALUL 4
[2:53:07] <Nekros4442> Yak 0 next?
[2:53:12] <+D00msDayDan> Wait until they fix halo 4
[2:53:17] <%Irridium> yeah you're good.
[2:53:18] <prime_name> Next Week: Halo 4 LP announced

[2:53:38] <agianttornado> YAKUZA
[2:53:38] <brachydios777> YAKUZIES YAY!
[2:53:40] <andre11dr> You did the good ones, your fine
[2:53:48] <Darren716> So Yak next Wed?
[2:53:49] <%SilverDevilfish> Reggie's going to love the Maiden Kappa
[2:53:52] <Nekros4442> Everyone else will be playing Cyberpunk anyway
[2:53:54] <%kyh9> I'd like a one-shot
[2:53:59] <@Solidus_113> One-off of just character customization
[2:54:01] <heartlesshealer> yeah probably better to go with the plan
[2:54:02] <Frostilk> let them patch cyberpunk a bit
[2:54:08] <andrewofbob> Maybe after 13 Sentinels is done
[2:54:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> but woolie the FOMO
[2:54:10] <%Irridium> just do the character customization LUL
[2:54:12] <%kyh9> @Solidus_113 Absolutely. Just the intro chapter with the life-path
[2:54:20] <+Lolo27234> try to play dusk at anytime i think its a really good indie fps and you would dig it
[2:54:27] <agianttornado> Release for cyberpunk still Dec. 10
[2:54:34] <%dreadedcthulhu> fuck the crunch and the transphobic developers tbh
[2:54:35] <andre11dr> @silverdevilfish Oh god ,i didn't consider this LUL
[2:54:36] <Nekros4442> Yakuza 0 is huge
[2:54:37] <%ekodrop> just a one off character creator
[2:54:39] <@Solidus_113> Reggie Souls
[2:54:40] <%wibbwobbler> DeS
[2:54:42] <X2Eliah> Wait for cyberpunk definitive edition
[2:54:45] <heartlesshealer> yakuza 0 with woolie will be great
[2:54:49] <%DappercatEsquire> cyberpunk isn't real
[2:54:57] <%dreadedcthulhu> reggie souls most hype
[2:54:58] <black_pariah> i am a halo 4 apologist and i love it to death so i'm loathe to hear chat shit all over it
[2:55:01] <MAX116030> oh yeah its going to be really buggy LUL
[2:55:02] <%Irridium> I want the kinks.
[2:55:08] <OldManDeckardCain> v thinks cyberpunk will be fixed in a week LUL
[2:55:20] <+flexin_apex> I’m so thrill u playing yakuza 0 soon <3
[2:55:29] <+wunp_fxs> it will matter. Just cant see it 24/7
[2:55:33] <heartlesshealer> they cut so many features from the time of the first trailer
[2:55:34] <Daxalog> The last big purchase I made was Necromunda on Steam. I think ill just wait.
[2:55:40] <OldManDeckardCain> if it's gonna be like witcher 3 it's gonna take a while
[2:55:43] <heartlesshealer> it's gonna be a while for it to be good
[2:55:50] <%Josef_Stryker> I have a bad feeling Cyberpunk is gonna go the way of Bioshock Infinite
[2:55:56] <%Josef_Stryker> I hope I'm wrong tho
[2:56:20] <Zayasu> they might even patch in some scrapped features later
[2:56:31] <heartlesshealer> exactly
[2:56:31] <andre11dr> I hope its good, that world seems so interesting
[2:56:32] <+MrProw> Eh, everyone will be playing Cyberpunk. I'd rather watch someone play something else.
[2:56:37] <%dreadedcthulhu> I actively hope for most AAA games bomb so the AAA studios finally get a kick in the ass
[2:56:43] <Hammatime8> I'm in that camp of "I'm worried it won't be too hot, but I hope people like it" too

[2:58:53] <heartlesshealer> the BloodFather
[3:00:09] <ToneBacas> sci fi not safe enough
[3:00:16] <brachydios777> Titan Fall 3 maybe after Fallen Order 2
[3:00:27] <DelgotHansto> Sorry what
[3:00:27] <@Moobot> Shoutouts to new sponsor @ArtesianBuilds! They'll build you a new PC live on http://twitch.tv/artesianbuilds & ship it to you within a week!

[3:00:28] <heartlesshealer> sci fi always in danger
[3:00:38] <Daxalog> Do people actually play Valorant
[3:00:46] <%Irridium> I BOUGHT IT :(
[3:00:47] <Nekros4442> Titanfall 2 ran up against Battlefield as well didnt it?
[3:00:57] <Darren716> I think the issue was TF2 and IW both came out when there were a shit ton of sci-fi shooters coming out
[3:00:58] <heartlesshealer> it killed both of them
[3:00:59] <+D00msDayDan> I wish infinite warfare wasn’t shackled to the call of duty money factory
[3:01:00] <%Irridium> @Nekros4442 yep sandwiched right between Battlefield 1 and Infinite Warfare
[3:01:01] <masterfire23> valorant is just magic cs
[3:01:02] <%wibbwobbler> titanfall 2 woolieVS battlefield lol
[3:01:04] <Daxalog> Also Valorant sucks as the sci fi shooter. All the characters are very boring.
[3:01:08] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT OVERWATCH
[3:01:10] <%dreadedcthulhu> shooters are not my jam in general
[3:01:14] <heartlesshealer> stupid competing release times destroys all media
[3:01:25] <%dreadedcthulhu> so AAA games are so rarely for me
[3:01:26] <%Irridium> I thought Valorant was fantasy with guns
[3:01:28] <%wibbwobbler> thnx ea
[3:01:29] <brachydios777> This would have done better if it wasn’t call of duty
[3:01:34] <Hammatime8> Most people buy COD for muliplayer, and everyone was saying Infinite Warfare had lousy MP, soooo
[3:01:36] <prime_name> Evolve your tastes, sheeple
[3:01:36] <@Solidus_113> Everyone buy Superliminal
[3:01:37] <Darren716> No it wouldn't have
[3:01:37] <jorniev> BUY DISCO ELYSIUM PLEASE
[3:01:38] <Clear_Truth> @woolieversus Have you heard of Einhander?
[3:01:43] <andrewofbob> Ultrakill
[3:01:50] <%Irridium> BUY 13 SENTINLES YOU FUCKS
[3:01:51] <Darren716> This game still sold gang busters just because it was a CoD game
[3:02:07] <Hammatime8> Everyone should own a copy of Heat Signature.
[3:02:10] <Dusty_Catz> Devs and publishers care about profit, and same old same old usually delivers
[3:02:11] <Darren716> People act like this game totally bombed but it still was one of the top selling games of 2016
[3:02:13] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> 13 sentinels is 30$
[3:02:18] <masterfire23> we need more movement shooters
[3:02:28] <heartlesshealer> 13 Sentinels is a good tactical visual novel
[3:03:05] <Daxalog> Yeah. Then only 1 survives
[3:03:17] <Daxalog> And no one ever goes back to old stuff
[3:03:23] <jorniev> hard space: ship breaker played by NO ONE
[3:03:29] <jorniev> awesome game
[3:03:50] <%dreadedcthulhu> week 1 sales are all that matters
[3:03:59] <jorniev> striping space ships for cash

[3:05:50] <Darren716> And with all that busted ass gear
