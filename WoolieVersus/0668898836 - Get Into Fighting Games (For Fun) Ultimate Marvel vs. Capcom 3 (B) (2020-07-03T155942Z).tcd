[0:21:13] <SilverFaustX> joey got fired !
[0:21:13] <WingedBalmung> @TheFramedWarlock Or to avoid a bigger backlash if you say nothing or otherwise. Like the backlash a mob is likely to bring
[0:21:13] <+hoebag699> wolverine has the power ranger theme
[0:21:14] <KeiPrime> MODOK's is the top theme
[0:21:14] <%infinite_rotation> @viewtiful_rose I love alot of things purely because they are stupid
[0:21:14] <%Doplghost> I hate how comics get restarted constantly so there are no stakes
[0:21:18] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> crabrave
[0:21:19] <%FreyRune> MvC3 has one of the best soundtracks in history

[0:21:34] <usurper_sos> AYAYA
[0:21:34] <WakeUpThrow> Haggar's theme is really good too
[0:21:36] <velvetroomalex> Comics can be the best kind of dumb sometimes
[0:21:36] <TheFramedWarlock> You don't get bigger backlash by saying you didn't do it you absolutd moron
[0:21:40] <Viewtiful_Rose> Modok is such a fun character and his theme is god tier
[0:21:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> this game looks crazy fun
[0:21:46] <Bloogoose> OH Taskmaster's is fucking fire as well
[0:21:47] <Mach5Mike> Chun-Li's theme in this game is really good, wish she could have more hype renditions of her themes in the SF games

[0:22:22] <Arc_Ray> hmm i think Joe might have the worst theme in the game as it sounds the least like the source material. like i know what song it SHOULD sound like, but it sounds like a BAD version of it.

[0:35:20] <DaKnightWarrior> lytSHADES
[0:35:20] <%ChoculaUltra> I CAN SEE THROUGH YOU
[0:35:28] <%Anonymasque> So what's left to look forward to. I got nothing.
[0:35:32] <Viewtiful_Rose> Jwong put tron in bottom tier in his tier lost for this game
[0:35:32] <%SomersaultJustice> the Taskmaster Kevin Sullivan
[0:35:39] <+Maldoree> did woolie talk aboit evo yet >_>
[0:35:41] <%lotharrio> Man, it's so stupid that Taskmaster has low-level super speed because he watches martial arts recordings at double speed.
[0:35:41] <+theaceclaw> MvC3 looks better looking than Infinite FeelsBadMan
[0:35:45] <KSDM> Taskmaster is ltierally what he is though
[0:35:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> modok is kinda a joke cause he looks stupid but he's super smart and capable
[0:35:47] <%Irridium> Taskmaster got the Timeshift guy's visor on his shield
[0:35:47] <%Jack8274> NOOOO REGGIE
[0:35:48] <TheFramedWarlock> Woolie did talk about evo
[0:35:50] <BlackermanZX> Man i love X 23
[0:35:51] <%DSD24> @Anonymasque Cyberpunk 2077 still looks fun?
[0:35:53] <Shingetterguyver> Should have had Moon Knight in this game.
[0:35:55] <+mighty_max_t> Dude, Laura's air mobility is so much fun
[0:35:55] <%FreyRune> Reggie, you dun gufed
[0:35:58] <theteaLordSamurai> god modok is jank
[0:35:59] <joylent_blue> Maldoree to the point of exhaustion, yes
[0:36:01] <WakeUpThrow> To be fair, MvC3 looks REALLY good
[0:36:01] <Arc_Ray> wait, why is Onlone EVO cnacelled from them replacing a CEO? did every game comapny leave too for no reason???
[0:36:02] <+AlphaRayAllen> Tron isn't the worst character, but she got done the dirtiest that's for sure
[0:36:04] <Graxe_> Achievement
[0:36:07] <T_Doobie> cheevos???

[0:36:12] <usurper_sos> CHEEVOS
[0:36:13] <dabeaminator> I hate tagteam systems. It's hard enough for me to learn one character in fighting games, like damn.
[0:36:16] <gordieda20> SPEED
[0:36:21] <+TheOneCalledRock> @theaceclaw to be fair it's not that hard to make a game that looks better than infinite OpieOP
[0:36:31] <BreakersAweigh> god i forgot about wolverine's theme
[0:36:32] <nicversus> Have you tried THIS?
[0:36:39] <%Anonymasque> @DSD24 I'm keeping my eye on Cyberpunk but I'm keeping my expectations a bit low.
[0:36:44] <TheFramedWarlock> @arc_ray CEO was a pedo, all the companies pulled out then EVO put out an official statement saying he was gone and EVO is cancelled
[0:36:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:36:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oh, is one of Wolverine's supers a Geneijin?
[0:36:58] <Zannablu_ke> hold on, are x-23 and sfv laura voiced by the same gal?
[0:36:59] <NeonBleu> respect the pipe
[0:36:59] <Shingetterguyver> Come on MVC4 lol
[0:37:01] <theteaLordSamurai> !motivated
[0:37:01] <@Moobot> 1364 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:37:01] <MattOtterPop> So Evo is officially cancelled, good.
[0:37:09] <aiutare47> We all meme about Woolie turning down a threesome for mahval, but that‚Äôs where the timeline forks. If Woolie had taken that offer we‚Äôd be down an even worse timeline.
[0:37:11] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @dabeaminator the upside is, your opponent can not lern all the matchups
[0:37:13] <+Bidoofshock> !motivated
[0:37:13] <@Moobot> 1365 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:37:14] <gordieda20> !MOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED
[0:37:17] <%DSD24> @Anonymasque Fair enough I still would like to see more gameplay but I am remaining optimistic
[0:37:23] <Viewtiful_Rose> @alpharayallen I don‚Äôt think tron sucks that bad either but Jwong often over exaggerates how good or bad certain characters are cuz he‚Äôs super opinionated especially against characters he used to main
[0:37:24] <Ultimatefool> Reggie only playing Doom for the FOOT-FOOT-DIE
[0:37:25] <%dieselssb> motivation
[0:37:25] <%Jack8274> OH DAMNG THAT CROSSUP
[0:37:30] <zerotk0> finally something good to look forward to
[0:37:35] <BlackMage66652> @aiutare47 What if that threesome led to the Best Timeline?
[0:37:43] <Man_in_the_Red> @aiutare47 i mean, it sounds too good to be true, it would probably lead to a missing kidney
[0:38:00] <MattOtterPop> any timeline has to be better than this current 2020 one?!? Surely?
[0:38:00] <aiutare47> @blackmage66652 I doubt it. I trust in his wisdom.
[0:38:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> NOW COMES THE DAMAGE
[0:38:03] <Man_in_the_Red> and thats the best outcome possible
[0:38:04] <%dieselssb> what a grab
[0:38:04] <joylent_blue> turning down the threesome was the proof that Woolie is the one we can trust
[0:38:05] <%SomersaultJustice> LUL
[0:38:05] <WakeUpThrow> SCOOP
[0:38:08] <BlackermanZX> OH
[0:38:10] <KeiPrime> you gotta level up modok's cube shit to get the real damage
[0:38:11] <%FreyRune> LOL
[0:38:11] <+VariantX7> this game still looks pretty damn good for how old it is

[0:39:20] <%ChoculaUltra> Taskmaster's lore is legit kinda sad at this point. He's memorized so many different fighting techniques via his power that it's starting to take up "disk space" for actual meaningful memories.

[0:43:48] <Man_in_the_Red> @crimsonphoenix69 because Darkstalkers resurection was sent to die with no advertisements so VSAV is dead
[0:43:49] <gordieda20> MH was cool
[0:43:51] <%ChoculaUltra> Monster Hunter was cool! Sort of.
[0:43:52] <dabeaminator> Wasn't Thanos okay in Infinite?
[0:43:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> who's cool in infinite? Like Black Panter and Monster Hunter?
[0:44:00] <Bloogoose> Sigma was fucking sick in Infinite
[0:44:05] <cipher758> zerooo
[0:44:10] <roada_rolla_da> Sigma and Jedah were cool in MvC I too
[0:44:12] <%ChoculaUltra> I really dug Ultron and Sigma too

[0:44:15] <%MarkTarkus> Down heavy and then rock woolie
[0:44:15] <KeiPrime> Sigma is fuckin nuts in infinite
[0:44:15] <+UberWolfman> I just want to play MVCi for MH
[0:44:18] <WakeUpThrow> Jedah deserved a spot in a Marvel game, shame it was in that one
[0:44:24] <stormhawk9891> @FuqBoiSlim Sigma's cool
[0:44:24] <+mighty_max_t> Spidey and Strider are my favorite verions of them in MVCI
[0:44:37] <zombie_doctor> infinite had its own issues that we are not going to geti nto
[0:44:37] <Viewtiful_Rose> I love watching Infinite never played it tho
[0:44:49] <DaKnightWarrior> so close woolie!
[0:44:52] <+mighty_max_t> Cap having new gimmick Shield Throws also was cool
[0:45:02] <%sexdrugsvideogames> darkstalkers resurrection for current gen would be nice
[0:45:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Infinite was the first time Jedah's been playable in an official game for almost 2 decades. It's wild how Capcom doesn't care about Darkstalkers.
[0:45:02] <Viewtiful_Rose> I‚Äôm like that with most fighting games I‚Äôll watch any game I just might not particularly play them myself
[0:45:03] <%Doplghost> Spencer in mvci had a grenade you could throw, and if you zip line into it, it makes a wallbounce
[0:45:11] <roada_rolla_da> Cap and Winter Soldier's combo Level 3 was sick too
[0:45:21] <+vinnysuperg123> Whens Mahvel
[0:45:22] <joylent_blue> there's something about the cutesy sparkle sfx going off while vergil's attacking that is very special

[0:46:08] <%prime_name> Man, V would be the best if they added him to the next crossover fighter.

[1:04:57] <BlackermanZX> Yeah the cheater gqlactus kill was hype LUL
[1:04:57] <CaptainPileDriver> IT WAS FUCKING SICK
[1:04:59] <ThatGuyThere03> what EVO?
[1:04:59] <joylent_blue> eyyyyy dante represent
[1:05:00] <%Superbro64> I think the galactus rage quits so the match loss doesnt count too LUL
[1:05:03] <+Rabbitmage> "FGC" isnt an organization. Its just people who play fighting games.
[1:05:03] <%PlumpPotatoRump> X-23 <3 <3 <3
[1:05:05] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:05:07] <joshua_42> EVO what‚Äôs that?
[1:05:12] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:05:17] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean to be fair, if there's any take away from all this - there's abusers e v e r y w h e r e - not just the fgc.
[1:05:18] <%Irridium> do the smash thing and replace the person with a bot LUL
[1:05:20] <ThatGuyThere03> I ain't never heard of no "EE-VOH"
[1:05:22] <%dinnydanny777> The only reason Resetera exists anyway is because the site it originally was ended up being ran by massively creepy and criminal weirdos so they should be cancelling themselves
[1:05:22] <%SirGO0SE> Galactus showing up in bracket LUL
[1:05:23] <%RadicalWeegee> THE BABE
[1:05:26] <+mighty_max_t> Captain Universe X-23 color!
[1:05:26] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:05:33] <Zannablu_ke> lovin' that classic spencer skin
[1:05:34] <+dkzk21> COMBOFIEND
[1:05:36] <%FreyRune> That reminds me of Gundam Versus where players hacked the game so they could play as boss units, imagine fighting the BIG ZAM out of nowhere
[1:05:37] <Agami23> man, i just want a she hulk tv show that is just marvel law and order
[1:05:48] <garionmilk> tfw shehulk will never SNU SNU you to death FeelsBadMan

[1:05:58] <+ikasukiz> Combofunction OpieOP
[1:05:59] <+phillybfgc> Is this PS4 or PC or something else?
[1:06:02] <+Rabbitmage> I'm not a big fan of cancel culture. If you don't like someone, unfollow and unsub. No need to try to destroy people.
[1:06:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> PC
[1:06:04] <theteaLordSamurai> 3 grab combo
[1:06:06] <alephalpha> yo x-23 theme

[1:06:10] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm still not over the cancellation of the Marvel Netflix shows ngl FeelsBadMan
[1:06:14] <%dinnydanny777> Well resetera is basically creeps calling other people creeps yeah
[1:06:14] <%Superbro64> you are surviving pretty well for marvel 3 online
[1:06:15] <+GenesisKnight> X-23's theme is so good
[1:06:17] <maple26> what if resetera cancels itself. where would those users even go?
[1:06:21] <garionmilk> x-23? more like xxx+18 Kreygasm
[1:06:27] <roada_rolla_da> Man, I just remembered how Phoenix Wright's ending in this game is him prosecuting Galactus, shit's too good

[1:06:45] <Solidnick18> he said the thing
[1:06:45] <+Soliloquy123> Easy mode is now selectable.
[1:06:45] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @maple26 giantbomb probably lmao
[1:06:46] <XxZulaxX> lytMOTIVATED
[1:06:47] <+ikasukiz> it already cancelled itself, when it was called NeoGAF Kappa
[1:06:57] <alephalpha> @Rabbitmage here's the thing that fair wehen it's just someone being weird or you just don't wnna deall with them when it's someone using their position to groom children that's a different story right
[1:06:59] <+Rabbitmage> how does EVO "dying" help anyone?

[1:07:26] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:07:28] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> How do you beat your own arm?
[1:07:35] <dabeaminator> Does Virgil just use Yamato in MVC, or does he have Force Edge too?
[1:07:38] <+mighty_max_t> Fun Fact: That red Hawkeye is a reference to the Evil Hawkeye from War of the Gems!

[1:09:06] <theteaLordSamurai> w a s h e d
[1:09:15] <%Superbro64> @rabbitmage evo decided to cancel the event for this year. If you cant agree with the decision they themselves chose to make, I cant help you there buddy
[1:09:19] <%TheBensonator_> jeebus
[1:09:32] <%DokAwesome> Marvel traced a picture of a leader in Spain for the house of m comkc and capcom used as it was a cool costume.
[1:09:35] <gordieda20> DETH
[1:09:51] <+Rabbitmage> Youre trying to imply that because one guy did a thing one time that EVO is some kind of breeding ground for molestation and should be canceled. That's pretty silly.
[1:09:52] <thelonechris> A little less of a family man
[1:09:57] <+PR0swagonist> damn couldnt get in
[1:09:59] <%dinnydanny777> The bow is always the best weapon
[1:10:09] <roada_rolla_da> Man, they removed Ant Man from Hawkeye's Level 3 in MvCI because they were SO going to include him as a playable character
[1:10:09] <%FreyRune> Hawkeye becomes a weeb

[1:11:02] <+Rabbitmage> @alephalpha That's a bunch of BS and rumor mongering.
[1:11:08] <+mighty_max_t> Classic Thor > Armored Thor
[1:11:13] <alephalpha> why ban kids when you can ban assholes?
[1:11:18] <Mordexai0> Ronans story was different online. legit it's just Hawkeye came back from hell & was super pissed.

[1:11:22] <KingHyperbole> Is this the MVC with the infamous iron man infinite?

[1:53:39] <bazz_tv> that run is great @maskedbugman

[1:54:06] <@Menitta> I still wish...Silk was as cool as she looks so she could be in MVC
[1:54:06] <roada_rolla_da> I wonder if they'd use the RE Engine if they were to make a MvC4, seems like they use that for everything nowadays
[1:54:09] <0rond> just put the new characters in ultimate back into umvc3 and rerelease it
