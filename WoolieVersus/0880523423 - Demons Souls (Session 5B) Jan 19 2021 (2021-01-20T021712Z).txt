[0:08:36] <BerryliciousDefinition> Nice
[0:08:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggies exposure is higher than Woolies. What does it mean?
[0:08:43] <jonblnt> crown of light
[0:08:53] <%ekodrop> cut lines over woolie's forehead
[0:08:55] <+jiggy_snipe> Fume Knight
[0:08:57] <%kewlmyc> O and S forces you to get good at the game
[0:08:57] <%waltzqueen> reggie the hero
[0:08:59] <%Amaideus> IVory King
[0:09:00] <+jiggy_snipe> or whatever
[0:09:02] <+RowenCleric> Reggie flashing his puppy eyes at chat
[0:09:05] <%kewlmyc> And yeah Fume Knight is a fuck
[0:09:09] <%Juriasu> fume knight NotLikeThis
[0:09:15] <%ChoculaUltra> the mystic death lines over woolie's head rn monkaS
[0:09:27] <%Amaideus> I thought Ivory took you even longer though?
[0:09:34] <au_d3n> Legit Fuming
[0:09:38] <%Javaa01> Fume Knight and Knight Alonne are fucking hard, but they are something else
[0:09:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> fume knight scarred woolie, even today he dreams of the attack patterns, he dodges in restless sleep
[0:09:43] <+Cozy90> RAIME IS PRETTY COOL
[0:09:46] <user_naim> Fume is the only one where I learned EVERY MOVE. I grinded the shit out of that dude.
[0:09:52] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:09:55] <KaiserMario> Father Gascoigne is also excellent
[0:09:59] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[0:10:00] <%Amaideus> Mine is Friede personally
[0:10:02] <%Javaa01> Also, Knight Alonne has the extra challenge of doing it without getting touched for that alternate death animation
[0:10:09] <%Amaideus> Doing that fight underleveled was an experience
[0:10:11] <+strakillias> So When's Reggie fighting Fume Knight?
[0:10:13] <$Invlux> Probably Knight Artorias
[0:10:15] <+RowenCleric> god the corpse run to Alonne is the worst
[0:10:33] <au_d3n> Nameless King?
[0:10:43] <@akuda_bar> why's woolie got a green on his face

[0:10:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah, but I want to! Besides, Reggie needs some good food after a night like this.
[0:11:10] <%Chatterbox1991> Deacons of the Deep i love
[0:11:14] <user_naim> Oh Maria is styling
[0:11:17] <RyuuAoi> PAY YOUR RENT, SPY
[0:11:18] <%waltzqueen> Maria's a ton of fun to fight! Feels good all the way through
[0:11:18] <+yukichocomilk> lady maria Kreygasm
[0:11:19] <%hax_metatron> Eh, I'd say Artorias and Maria
[0:11:20] <OblivionSword1> Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower
[0:11:20] <%kewlmyc> Compared to Orphan of Kos which is just annoying
[0:11:24] <bobxmaker> Sif is my all-time most loved boss in souls game, just because the idea behind the fight.
[0:11:24] <%Amaideus> My tops is still Pontif
[0:11:33] <%Amaideus> Holy shit Pontif is such a sick boss
[0:11:38] <velgaduere> lmao
[0:11:43] <%Amaideus> You can TELL he was gonna be the final boss originally
[0:11:43] <user_naim> Shout out to Living Failures OST!
[0:11:47] <+RowenCleric> Maria is such a balanced difficult of learning and tough
[0:11:53] <Tuna_Can_0> I wish maria was harder FeelsBadMan. fire phase was too short
[0:11:59] <glass_marcus> Man, Lady Maria is so goddamn cool
[0:12:00] <%waltzqueen> @RyuuAoi he can't pay his rent, he's too busy spying and eating artesian foods
[0:12:05] <DrZomboo> I would put Ludwig in that category too! Not the hardest but just epic!
[0:12:17] <siamzero94> nobody mentioning gael *feels bad*
[0:12:19] <RaidenRising> lady maria was great
[0:12:29] <Tuna_Can_0> @siamzero94 gael is my favorite :)
[0:12:36] <%Amaideus> Gael is top 10 somewhere
[0:12:37] <tetrabrick1lt> PogChamp
[0:12:42] <siamzero94> @Tuna_Can_0 ayy my man
[0:12:55] <%Amaideus> Only because these games have too many goddamn good bosses
[0:13:07] <%ChoculaUltra> I know its not on the same level, but damn, the first few times doing Abyss Watchers is an experience I'd kill to feel again
