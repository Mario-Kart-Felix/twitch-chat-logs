[0:39:02] <+Lazy_Vagabond> if you want some heat moves for breaker you pretty much need to do the training for it

[0:39:28] <thetrashman_sc> its the combat dimension no one actually dies Kappa
[0:39:31] <%Juriasu> yes it is
[0:39:32] <Darmanimon> it's so weird to tune in to a game you guys play that I have actually played before, it means that I can actually tune in whenever with no continuity and it's fine
[0:39:32] <privatespidey> Definitely not dead simulator
[0:39:34] <velgaduere> "do you have what it takes to never kill anyone?"
[0:39:37] <OblivionSword1> it is a bit low
[0:39:40] <PsychoPearl> yes

[0:41:32] <%ggbhtg> Do Combo Da

[0:44:34] <+zanzibar_junker> the later darts game is much better
[0:44:38] <@Menitta> P5R has an amazing dart minigame
[0:44:40] <TheHylianGuard> the karts in kiwami 2 are similar to ff7 remake's
[0:44:44] <TheHylianGuard> darts*
[0:44:51] <Solidnick18> break shins
[0:44:59] <Darmanimon> Darts in GTA4 was pretty good on PC at least. Although the rest of the game on PC isn't as good

[0:45:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DEAD
[0:45:29] <%ggbhtg> Dragunov has that move in Tekken

[0:49:36] <exnuart> your life meter is your hunger meater

[0:50:44] <@Squdnate> @MrPedrovsky Can you whisper me a link?
[0:50:48] <OblivionSword1> kiwami 2 and 6 has hunger gauge
[0:50:53] <%Javaa01> Yeah Dragon Engine games have a fullness gauge
[0:50:59] <Zebroneath> Kiwami 2 and 6 has a seperate hunger meter
[0:51:03] <%Lion_kun> This is how you get the trouble finder Right?

[0:51:45] <%MrPedrovsky> @squdnate I’ll try. But it is now burried in our dank Russian forum. I hope you have VPN. On mobile so I can’t guarantee the fastness of response

[0:51:57] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Play Nioh.
[0:51:58] <digitalslime> hunger bad
[0:51:58] <servicesuspension> yep, weapon durability is the shit one
[0:52:04] <RyuuAoi> Ugh San Andreas
[0:52:05] <thetrashman_sc> literally nothing wrong with hunger gauges
[0:52:13] <%dukenux> stamina gauge is worse IF it's really short
[0:52:37] <%dukenux> yeah, weapon durability does nothing for me
[0:52:37] <user_naim> Snake Eater is interesting.
[0:52:39] <%MrPedrovsky> Gameplay is on 2ch(dot)hk/v
[0:52:40] <Blank9> nioh's so good
[0:52:40] <Darmanimon> my least favorite hunger gauge was in We Happy Few
[0:52:41] <%dukenux> i could do without it
[0:52:50] <%Livelinne> hannari chrisp10Nice
[0:52:55] <%MrPedrovsky> Should be top thread
[0:52:59] <+Grim1952> Nioh would be better without stamina
[0:53:00] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Nioh 2's a blast, especially now that you can PUNCH THINGS
[0:53:03] <ZeeJiggle> "Honey, why are you making so much steak?" "Mountain Climbin'"
[0:53:04] <TheHylianGuard> yeah but it then makes food worth cooking and finding
[0:53:10] <@Solidus_113> There was a short point in time where Warframe had a stamina system. It sucked so bad
[0:53:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> @mrpedrovsky gameplay for what?
[0:53:12] <doomerskeletor13> Fallen Order has enemies with stamina iirc
[0:53:13] <%dukenux> SA was annoying, but atleast you could get HUGE by overeating

[1:25:01] <+runegod20> i knew it could have plates, I didn't know it could straight up have money
[1:25:05] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> Do you need to do ocean fishing for turtles?
[1:25:05] <brachydios777> Snapping turtles would
[1:25:12] <Wofoeh> Now it’s time to fish for Mitch McConnell, I mean... a turtle
[1:25:14] <Pt_Kamen> Other fishing spot!
[1:25:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1351446630420148224
[1:25:17] <flame_of_udun_> Stop stealing the turtles wallet
[1:25:18] <+FreddyLeeSavage> Ok so first time seeing the new camera angle and it really threw me off cuz i thought Woolie was sitting on V's lap
[1:25:22] <Darmanimon> fishing up a snapping turtle just seems like a bad mistake
[1:25:22] <andritt> Can you move to the other side of the river?
[1:25:24] <+Zebylth> turtle isnt here
[1:25:24] <hazeprojekt> other fishing spot
[1:25:30] <%cache_22> I did not really do the fishing mini game in 0. So some fish only spawn in specific fishing spots?
[1:25:34] <atteroproxy> Just go for the salmon
[1:25:34] <digitalslime> more then one fishing spot, swap to spawn more shapes
[1:25:35] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Other fishing spot for turtle IIRC
[1:25:56] <Mothman742> @freddyleesavage who's to say he isn't?
[1:26:01] <Kuubyy> kyoudai...
[1:26:08] <%emperordread> Crane games are 100% skill yo
[1:26:16] <hkgamingtv> I think they're right about other spot
[1:26:24] <waffleandman> i must've been really lucky doing this LUL
[1:26:36] <atteroproxy> @cache_22 Yes but it literally only matters for this sidequest
[1:26:44] <PsychoPearl> Fishiki KomodoHype
[1:26:46] <%Lion_kun> RNG pools vary from different spots. Also some fish exclusively show up with the bait.
[1:26:50] <doomerskeletor13> When Ray played this game it took him forever to get a salmon

[1:31:11] <+ASovietSharkPro> Grim, I'd say WORSE because this is something that actually impacts other people outside of just a picture
[1:31:12] <atteroproxy> This is the actual most annoying side mission
[1:31:17] <DaBigVitus> that one restauraunt side quest with all the fishing. shivers.

[1:32:02] <+ASovietSharkPro> How come every JRPG of any kind has to have a fishing game in it?
[1:32:05] <+Grim1952> Fishing in FF15 was better though, i enjoyed it a lot
[1:32:07] <doomerskeletor13> It’s absolutely worth it, I think people are just anxious because of the story beat we left off on
[1:32:09] <PiGreat> this one'll be interesting to see on youtube
[1:32:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> neat
[1:32:15] <%cache_22> After looking it up, it seems like the Special and Top-Grade Bait are only found in Dream Machines. The Quality Bait is in the M Store.

[1:37:33] <+noajenkk> the most metal of all fish!
[1:37:36] <%Lion_kun> Salmon would be a bulky fish.
[1:37:36] <chainsaw105> no salmon only bass!
[1:37:44] <notsoy> according to the cyricz guide, salmon do not need bait to appear
[1:37:47] <OldManDeckardCain> love that black tendency bass

[1:41:38] <+mundanelotus> what happened to the couch camera?
[1:41:49] <%justmildlilac> @Javaa01 That makes sense, since the Kiwamis are more sequels to 0 instead of just remakes

[1:43:49] <%cache_22> According to the guide the Salmon is a medium shadow. The shadow is the same size as the koi and carp.
[1:44:08] <+condemned_15> Thicc fish
[1:44:15] <morningmoondude> i got some salmon in my freezer i could mail you, probably faster.
[1:44:21] <@Solidus_113> guild says salmon isn't effected by bait
[1:44:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> I think the salmon has to be moving, but I could be wrong

[1:58:36] <hkgamingtv> IT'S FIIINE......
[1:58:43] <CharlieDJohnson> thats the one exception, but in that case the question is not one of "straight response or funny response" but just choose your color, so the main rule applies "always pick the funny response if available"
[1:58:45] <%vinylxg> @justmildlilac pushing my depression back as much as possible. i feel weird because i not sure how i should talk to people
[1:58:46] <Blank9> MY HEAD... IT HURTS....

[2:14:44] <%Juriasu> you know it's one of the good ones when they are in the bath
[2:14:45] <%dukenux> Steamin Hams?
[2:14:45] <%Terrarp> Yakuza 6 is the weirdest because of the 'its growing' thing
[2:14:46] <%nintega010> Is Hitomi Tanaka one of them
[2:14:47] <RyuuAoi> I like dat ass shot
[2:14:48] <X2Eliah> Is Woolie about to find snakes in the pipes?

[2:15:10] <OokamiDen02> it would be censored anyway
[2:15:11] <Bluewolf544> OR ARE YOU??
[2:15:15] <Vyneci> I wonder if someone has modded hardcore into those videos
[2:15:15] <R3c0n31> Kiryu doesnt even know what sex is, its what gives him strength
[2:15:17] <Halospaz117> @Klefth This one actually

[2:53:19] <twoto858> *breakdances furiously* I WILL PROTECT YOU
[2:53:23] <atteroproxy> HEAT MOVE WHEN THEY GRAB HER
[2:53:29] <+QueequegTheater> Man, that move in particular is fucking devastating to Shakedowns once you max out the skill tree
[2:53:30] <Krisaeron> The best of Mamoru
[2:53:31] <+Ancopro> girls are here but can't watch
[2:53:31] <KaitlynnHere> Noice
[2:53:32] <%psidefx> Time for Sneak-KING™
[2:53:33] <Prevot> she's... not actually watching tho

[2:53:57] <+runegod20> isn't it possible to brute force this part and skip stealth?
[2:53:59] <%AMUSERNAME> >TFW the QT you're protecting can't see your cool breakdancing moves.
[2:53:59] <alvaroeltz> majima learned from moe
[2:54:00] <DedlokPM> @LVL1_Scumbag Not lied. Just was vague on the details. Not to mention that in the Japanese version he used gender neutral terms in addition to the fact that Makoto is a gender neutral name
[2:54:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RageCasanova
[2:54:03] <jorniev> GIRLS ARE NOT WATCHING
[2:54:11] <hkgamingtv> ruh oh
[2:54:13] <+QueequegTheater> "I'm not out of breath because you kicked my ass, I'm just morbidly obese"
[2:54:14] <+RageCasanova> *Eddie
[2:54:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ESCORT MISSION TIME
[2:54:17] <Doctadaking> I foresee some frustration in the next section
[2:54:18] <mortificent> someone dissing your fly girl??
[2:54:20] <servicesuspension> makoto is the most unisex name you can have
[2:54:21] <chainsaw105> girls are incapable of watching
[2:54:21] <Afroperonista> ANIKI
[2:54:25] <X2Eliah> BRO!
[2:54:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO YOU LIKE ESCORT MISSIONS WOOLIE?
[2:54:28] <+LynbellDaYo> This part is so unnecessary and annoying
[2:54:28] <%NovaKnightmare> JUST EM ONE OF THESE
[2:54:32] <MyNameIsRasus> GIRLS ARE HEARING
[2:54:33] <+runegod20> he might have lied about makoto being a piece of scum, but he might not have known trhat makoto was a girl
[2:54:36] <%gatorafan> Kyoudai!
[2:54:37] <KaitlynnHere> Let’s hide here so I can kill you
[2:54:39] <Jp_DrZaius> Bro got dance to death
[2:54:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Man, between Majima and the girl we got 2 Woolies worth of vision.
[2:54:41] <+QueequegTheater> GIRLS ARE WATCHING...WITH EARS
[2:54:45] <%AMUSERNAME> I hope my breakdancing yells and whoops sound really cool and stylish to this girl.
[2:54:47] <@Solidus_113> Now we Stealth Escort mission
[2:54:48] <laguerrilha> i like that suit color
[2:54:57] <KaitlynnHere> Girls are listening
[2:54:57] <%Asuterisuku> @runegod20 He never once gave Majima a gender description.
[2:54:57] <hkgamingtv> ESCORT BATTLEROO
[2:55:00] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Don't you guys dare compare her to P5 Makoto just cause they have the same name.
[2:55:01] <MyNameIsRasus> LEWD
[2:55:04] <+RyTYoung> Guide a blind lady with one eye Kappa
[2:55:04] <+QueequegTheater> Why is he saying her name like that
[2:55:10] <X2Eliah> JUSR LIKE ASSCREED
[2:55:16] <+QueequegTheater> Mack-oto?
[2:55:20] <siamzero94> yeah i like this makoto more
[2:55:21] <Prevot> Majima Auditore da Firenze
[2:55:24] <%psidefx> "There's a pair of eyes between us both"
[2:55:27] <KaitlynnHere> @rytyoung at least he’s not completely blind
[2:55:32] <thetrashman_sc> honestly its not even that bad
[2:55:32] <Halospaz117> It's not that bad honestly
[2:55:33] <alvaroeltz> encounter finder is really useful for this
[2:55:34] <%Asuterisuku> There is another major character in Yakuza named Makoto; we'll meet them next game.
[2:55:34] <Ner234> Stealth-cort
[2:55:35] <%ThisIsLloyd> Who's favourite part i just wanna talk
[2:55:35] <+QueequegTheater> @psidefx not even
[2:55:36] <OldManDeckardCain> better stealth than modern assassin's creed LUL
[2:55:39] <T_Sasquatch> Oh boy escort missions !
[2:55:41] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> This Makoto is a godess, P5's Makoto sucks.
[2:55:47] <missingangle> "Keep an eye on her... cause that's all you have between you two."
[2:55:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gladly its short
[2:55:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> stealth 100
[2:55:52] <+RyTYoung> @kaitlynnhere True, it's not too taboo
[2:55:52] <+Euphbugg> Stealth Escort, truely the best combination....
[2:55:55] <DedlokPM> @psidefx actually just 1 eye between the 2 of them.
[2:55:56] <+runegod20> it's honestly isn't too hard and you can say screw it and just fight everyone instead of stealthing
[2:56:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> why
[2:56:11] <%Asuterisuku> Busted.
[2:56:13] <+RageCasanova> Hmm this flavor what is this. I'm sensing notes of... Assassin's Creed? Tekken? AND DEAD RISING?
[2:56:14] <%gatorafan> The music tho SourPls
[2:56:15] <thetrashman_sc> woolie pls
[2:56:17] <KaitlynnHere> Is there an explanation as to why Majima has one eye?
[2:56:19] <+QueequegTheater> Ann and Haru are cooler than P5 Makoto because Ann and Haru are actual people while Makoto is an anime trope
[2:56:19] <X2Eliah> omg
[2:56:20] <Equirah> ......
[2:56:20] <Timarkot> SourPls
[2:56:23] <jotabranded> SourPls
[2:56:23] <Prevot> just walk right into them LUL
[2:56:24] <alvaroeltz> woolie, they a literal vision cone
[2:56:24] <+QueequegTheater> change my mind
[2:56:28] <%Asuterisuku> This track, though.
[2:56:29] <BitOSalt> Stealth mission *runs at enemies*
[2:56:30] <+RyTYoung> @kaitlynnhere yeah
[2:56:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:56:31] <hkgamingtv> @KaitlynnHere yes
[2:56:31] <Doctadaking> The minimap Woolie
[2:56:32] <Bluewolf544> p5 makoto > yakuza
[2:56:34] <%Juriasu> I love the music switching from calm to go mode in this sequence SourPls
[2:56:35] <%dukenux> thats not too baf
[2:56:36] <%Asuterisuku> gdqTunes
[2:56:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kaitlynnhere he got fired of having two
[2:56:36] <+Deko_> @KaitlynnHere a bit earlier in the story
[2:56:38] <%dukenux> *bad
[2:56:39] <therat_giant> SourPls
[2:56:42] <thetrashman_sc> @KaitlynnHere yes he lost a fight and some dude stabbed it out
[2:56:44] <+runegod20> i think it is totally possible to have hid there and not get caught, just pretty tight
[2:56:46] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @KaitlynnHere yes, explained in a flashback from 4, that they also included earlier in this game
[2:56:50] <R3c0n31> Luckily she cant see you literally not killing people
[2:56:51] <%ThisIsLloyd> it's not that bad compared to similar mechanics coming to play in a future game for like 3 chapters
[2:56:52] <alephalpha> @QueequegTheater you right but persona cats have generally been weak after 2
[2:56:52] <OblivionSword1> thankfully the enemies are chumps
[2:56:57] <+Ancopro> oh nooo i got caught *listens to bop*
[2:56:59] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater No, you're correct. Haru and Ann are top tier, Makoto is a walking anime trope.
[2:57:00] <%HollowedIdjit> Has Woolie done Slugger's Guardbreak Heat move?
[2:57:04] <KaitlynnHere> Oof, stabbed in the eye sounds painful
[2:57:04] <strudel_h> @kaitlynnhere he was tortured
[2:57:09] <+QueequegTheater> @alephalpha Persona started at 3
[2:57:11] <+runegod20> thankfully you're a demi god so they kind of just die easily
[2:57:20] <Doctadaking> Treat the minimap like MGS1. Just stare at it the whole time
[2:57:27] <+NotHereToStream> time to not kill
[2:57:28] <Mattais88> SNAP
[2:57:30] <alephalpha> @QueequegTheater oof
[2:57:30] <MyNameIsRasus> @QueequegTheater can't change a mind that's correct
[2:57:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Time for non violence
[2:57:32] <+RyTYoung> @kaitlynnhere not as bad as being shot in the eye Big Boss style ohnS
[2:57:33] <hkgamingtv> 8 more days until I can play the rest of the series
[2:57:34] <%Asuterisuku> Persona is a JoJo ripoff.
[2:57:39] <@Solidus_113> KILLED

[2:58:13] <pricklypissant> Kiryu, I'm already a mad dog.
[2:58:19] <servicesuspension> the courage to never kill anyone
[2:58:20] <%Javaa01> It's a vision cone
[2:58:25] <%Javaa01> They do not have ears
[2:58:29] <KaitlynnHere> If not dead then why did his neck make a cracking noise?
[2:58:31] <Mattais88> he used the flat of his arm
[2:58:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Soliton Radar System...
[2:58:41] <%dukenux> Greatest Cabaret Host in the world
[2:58:43] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> I'm so glad to be finding Persona fans with good taste.
[2:58:53] <+runegod20> as long as the screen went black from you entering the hiding spot, they could be watching you hide and ignore you
[2:58:55] <ghoststalker> CULB
[2:59:00] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Woolie's fandom really is heaven.
[2:59:00] <For_Temeria> Bugged
[2:59:01] <laguerrilha> LUL
[2:59:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> you can perfect stealth it
[2:59:03] <+QueequegTheater> @Sonny_FIRESTORM Ironically, I think Ann is good on accident, since a big part of her deal is the whole quarter-American ancestry (which isn't at all how ethnicity works but whatever), but Westerners don't give a shit about that, so she's just a normal girl, which is fairly rare in anime
[2:59:04] <PsychoPearl> uuh
[2:59:10] <@akuda_bar> CULB
[2:59:11] <siamzero94> they shoudl've moved
[2:59:12] <atteroproxy> I never had to fight unless it was canned
[2:59:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> "IS THERE SOMEONE BEHIND ME?"
[2:59:18] <Timarkot> Let him figure it out
[2:59:19] <%Asuterisuku> Hitch in the stream there.
[2:59:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> You can totally go the short way by fighting
[2:59:23] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> we're now doing the guns blazing route
[2:59:24] <iswearimjustdandy> @kaitlynnhere because
[2:59:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You can stealth the entire section
[2:59:31] <PsychoPearl> wut
[2:59:34] <Mattais88> This feels bugged
[2:59:38] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[2:59:38] <siamzero94> they're bugged
[2:59:39] <PsychoPearl> oh
[2:59:40] <Exodusprime1256> wherever you go, dont cheat futaba
[2:59:41] <@akuda_bar> this section is a bit jank
[2:59:46] <+gustavozxd> I see him! I lost him
[2:59:47] <%NovaKnightmare> time to breakdance
[2:59:49] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[2:59:49] <thetrashman_sc> yeah i did this section with no fights
[2:59:54] <KaitlynnHere> @iswearimjustdandy I see
[2:59:54] <alvaroeltz> could have hid
[2:59:56] <+MajorCrasher> it takes a few seconds for them to aggro you
[2:59:59] <@akuda_bar> claire, get back here little lady!! you return those books to the- where'd she go
[3:00:07] <caninedog1998> are you playing on pc woolie?
[3:00:15] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[3:00:15] <+QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[3:00:18] <thetrashman_sc> bruh
[3:00:22] <PsychoPearl> welp
[3:00:23] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie is on PC, yes.
[3:00:23] <+Ancopro> bring on the fights
[3:00:25] <siamzero94> FUCK IT KILL EVERYONE
[3:00:26] <therat_giant> where'd she go
[3:00:27] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus remember you have a Stun attack on B, with a relevant Heat Action
[3:00:27] <+LynbellDaYo> big brain stealth
[3:00:29] <%gatorafan> BRING ON THE FIGHTS!
[3:00:29] <hkgamingtv> damn npcs
[3:00:34] <+Euphbugg> brute force is a skill
[3:00:34] <+Tucker0603> this is acting jank
[3:00:37] <@akuda_bar> claire, there you are- ...where'd she go
[3:00:37] <Doctadaking> Press circle with 3 heat with slugger for best heat move
[3:00:37] <notsoy> no penalties for getting caught unless makoto gets hit
[3:00:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @akuda_bar you cannot escap- where'd she go?!
[3:00:40] <servicesuspension> you can't get caught if you murder everyone
[3:00:40] <hkgamingtv> not ded
[3:00:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> y'know, beating them all up in retrospect feels more, MAJIMA style
[3:00:44] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater I get where you're coming from, but what I like about Ann is how her confidant ends. The whole quarter-american thing is just a small detail.
[3:00:46] <+QueequegTheater> BRUTE SMARTS
[3:00:47] <chainsaw105> game: Stealth is optional for this mission me:
[3:00:51] <+runegod20> thankfully brute force are two skills that majima is skilled at
[3:00:53] <%Asuterisuku> 60fps looks so choppy after playing at 160.
[3:01:03] <Ultimatefool> They can't stop you if you kill them all
[3:01:09] <Halospaz117> Fuckin launched him AT Makoto
[3:01:13] <+QueequegTheater> @Asuterisuku ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:01:19] <%gatorafan> They shouldn't have looked
[3:01:25] <KaitlynnHere> Good thing she can’t see, that was brutal
[3:01:27] <%marrs_bars> Just got here, loving the new camera set up SeemsGood
[3:01:28] <+QueequegTheater> @Sonny_FIRESTORM True
[3:01:32] <hkgamingtv> go leafs go
[3:01:32] <+Euphbugg> if brute force doesn't work, your just not using enough of it
[3:01:40] <+Ancopro> yeyey
[3:01:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> YE
[3:01:43] <alephalpha> but can we all talk about Jun though
[3:01:45] <DedlokPM> mogsPOG
[3:01:52] <%Double_Tap_That> frame perfect
[3:01:52] <R3c0n31> I smell breaking of dance
[3:01:57] <brachydios777> Cheese
[3:01:57] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[3:01:57] <chainsaw105> brute stealth
[3:02:01] <atteroproxy> Speed run tactics
[3:02:05] <+gustavozxd> @Asuterisuku FPS above 60 sounds like cursed knowledge
[3:02:09] <+QueequegTheater> There are very few problems in life that are not solved via the proper application of brute force
[3:02:12] <RyuShinden> Cool heat move PogChamp
[3:02:15] <Halospaz117> OH THAT WAS CUTE
[3:02:16] <+runegod20> ooo, I didn't know there was a special heat move for this
[3:02:17] <+condemned_15> Mamoru HEATO
[3:02:17] <+Grim1952> Essence of Mamoru
[3:02:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Automatically getting caught at the end: the hallmark of great stealth missions.
[3:02:19] <%Asuterisuku> Unique Heat Action that can only be done in this segment.
[3:02:22] <Halospaz117> CUTE AND COOL
[3:02:23] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater It's just like with Kanji in P4, western audiences just focused entirely on LGBT and entirely neglected the fact that he was never gay to begin with.
[3:02:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Looking cool, Majima!
[3:02:25] <RyuShinden> ESSENCE OF MUH QUEEN
[3:02:26] <%gatorafan> Heat Mamoru
[3:02:29] <SherlockianHero> I have a soft spot for the heat move for saving Makoto.
[3:02:30] <%Asuterisuku> If you miss that, you cannot finish the Completion List. So good job.
[3:02:31] <+Euphbugg> yahoo indeed
[3:02:37] <SherlockianHero> YEAH!!
[3:02:38] <caninedog1998> @Asuterisuku damn 160?? I only got around 100fps, but I used max graphics setting with some visual mods tbf
[3:02:39] <+gustavozxd> if brute force doesn't work, it means you didn't brute force it hard enough
[3:02:41] <%dukenux> Wacky Yahoo Eyepatch Man
[3:02:43] <Prevot> sir, why are you telling yahoo?
[3:02:43] <+QueequegTheater> @Sonny_FIRESTORM Except it actually works with Ann
[3:02:44] <+nekomancerer> yahooo, mam your life is in danger
[3:02:45] <hkgamingtv> Majima Makoto simp confirmed
[3:03:01] <hkgamingtv> shiny
[3:03:02] <+Euphbugg> Part two, Brute force harder
[3:03:06] <digitalslime> listening to majima fight and not seeing it must be crazy
[3:03:07] <KaitlynnHere> I never knew ya-hoo was a universal phrase
[3:03:20] <servicesuspension> escort missions are fun and always well received
[3:03:29] <%gatorafan> This is where the statue dude comes to life to help you and the dude with the Stajun diverts aggro
[3:03:30] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[3:03:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> @KaitlynnHere I mean,he's probably yelling the English phrase
[3:03:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:03:39] <servicesuspension> oh no the assasin is sitting on a bench what do we do
[3:03:41] <hkgamingtv> Mission Impossible 1 tec
[3:03:41] <linSP> fellas when are we gonna kill the mark
[3:03:42] <Prevot> good thing she's not wearing a stajun
[3:03:49] <%Asuterisuku> @caninedog1998 It's the best when you have a monitor that can display it though.
[3:03:52] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater It's cause P4 was more party-centric than P5. Palaces are usually centered around the villains
[3:03:55] <+gustavozxd> this guy wearing a black suit and an eyepatch is hard to find when he's standing next to 3 people
[3:03:56] <siamzero94> @KaitlynnHere wasn't that the reason Yahoo actually has a foothold in japan instead of google?
[3:04:02] <RyuShinden> That bridge always has something happening LUL
[3:04:05] <ghoststalker> Throw them off the bridge!
[3:04:06] <%dukenux> @digitalslime she just hears "YAHOO" and sound of the bones breaking
[3:04:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Prevot "Are you blind? I'LL KI-" you get the idea.
[3:04:18] <+QueequegTheater> BRING ON THE FIGHTS
[3:04:21] <Josef_Stryker> BRING ON THE FIGHTS
[3:04:21] <%Asuterisuku> Iwao Bridge!
[3:04:23] <Indigo_Automaton> The Beating Bridge
[3:04:24] <alephalpha> @Sonny_FIRESTORM considering the writing as is Kanji is deifntely questioning and msot liekly bi but you know people need room to figure themselves out, also the whole naoto thing screams trnas but while that explicitly isn't it in the tetx what is is very poorly written
[3:04:24] <Halospaz117> MAKOTO TAKE OFF THE JACKET
[3:04:26] <servicesuspension> Makoto can hear the crack of bones better than anyone
[3:04:28] <R3c0n31> Why did i hear someone head explode Majima-san
[3:04:29] <+Euphbugg> This bridge is repaired using the bones of the fallen
[3:04:35] <%Asuterisuku> Remove the Stajun, Makoto!
[3:04:35] <@Solidus_113> what's a vision range
[3:04:39] <+QueequegTheater> Doesn't Kiryu fight a huge group of dudes on this bridge in like 2 or 5?
[3:04:40] <caninedog1998> @Asuterisuku hell yeah dude! mine is 144hz atpGasm
[3:04:43] <Ultimatefool> They are multiplying
[3:04:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good thing the Yakuza are all nearsighted
[3:04:54] <Indigo_Automaton> Mr Shakedown rises out of the river
[3:04:54] <%HollowedIdjit> "THIS LOOKS LIKE A PARTY"
[3:04:54] <Halospaz117> Shakedown is Chaotic Neutral
[3:04:58] <RyuShinden> Mr. Shakedown: HEY, GIVE ME MONEY BLIND GIRL
[3:04:59] <%Asuterisuku> @caninedog1998 165 here. Everything's so smooooooth
[3:05:04] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus SHAKEDOWN TEAMUP
[3:05:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[3:05:15] <%RaziWraith> that run animation LUL
[3:05:17] <%justmildlilac> Team heat move with shakdown
[3:05:21] <%Feralspirit41> All the grunts running in unison is hilarious
[3:05:22] <Mattais88> Gut=y in blue is like the accountant
[3:05:23] <+QueequegTheater> "Yo, Egashira, these dudes have tons of money, fight alongside me"
[3:05:25] <%justmildlilac> *Shakedown
[3:05:33] <thetrashman_sc> dude i want some bad dude to call me slim Kreygasm
[3:05:39] <%Asuterisuku> My brother has a 240hz monitor though I've never actually played anything at that frame rate.
[3:05:44] <X2Eliah> gotta slim down first
[3:05:45] <@Menitta> I like the idea of Shakedown currently swimming in the river fighting the fish for money
[3:05:54] <masterfire23> 240hz is nice it feels so smooth
[3:05:55] <KaitlynnHere> Are they calling you slim because they’d met you while you were fighting that big guy?
[3:06:05] <KaitlynnHere> Because they’re the same size
[3:06:16] <Wan6Saber> bam
[3:06:20] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Majima is strong, but he's always been kinda slim looking, face structurally even
[3:06:24] <Halospaz117> @Menitta The rivers of sotenbori used to be laden with sharks. Then shakedown arrived
[3:06:24] <@Solidus_113> Who names their kid "tasty"
[3:06:26] <+runegod20> the lack of friendly fire and them having to go into a grab animation does make it not too bad at least
[3:06:29] <resloxxx> bop
[3:06:30] <Liquid_Dio> BONK
[3:06:31] <resloxxx> BOP
[3:06:35] <user_naim> louiseyBonk
[3:06:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @KaitlynnHere I get the impression Majima is supposed to have a slender build? Problem is that he's huge compared to everyone else so
[3:06:41] <thetrashman_sc> majima is wiry
[3:06:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Oishii is tasty, Oishi is something else probably
[3:06:50] <ghoststalker> @solidus_113 I think it’s a surname
[3:07:00] <oldwest1234> god imagine if you could accidentally club makoto in the head with a bat
[3:07:04] <KaitlynnHere> No deaths
[3:07:05] <+QueequegTheater> @Th3SmartAlec WHen the comparison point is Kiryu, everyone is slim
[3:07:05] <caninedog1998> @Asuterisuku yeah it's truly an incredible experience, especially for me since I always played on console before LUL
[3:07:09] <%Asuterisuku> If possible, I think there's a mod that replaces all the main game models with their higher-resolution cutscene equivalents.
[3:07:11] <alephalpha> suits also tend to have the fefct of avergaing out your build like if you're huge you look smaller and vice versa
[3:07:15] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> It's more obvious from his fighting styles in later entires that Majima is the fast and slim agile type to Kiryu's BEEF style
[3:07:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> "...we were holding them BACK'"

[3:07:53] <+runegod20> with how long it's been I'm surprised he remembered that part for kiryu, what was he doing again?

[3:07:55] <thetrashman_sc> SHE WAS HOLDING IT BACK
[3:07:56] <+Ancopro> running with toast in mouth
[3:07:57] <%Feralspirit41> Theres a magic seal that protects the empty lot and only she can unseal it
[3:07:57] <%LastHazzerd> she's a Lot Maiden
[3:08:00] <KaitlynnHere> The lot is her magic transformation zone
[3:08:00] <PiGreat> LUL
[3:08:03] <%dukenux> so its confirmed Majima killed that guy no?
[3:08:03] <MyNameIsRasus> :)
[3:08:05] <%gatorafan> The lot is in HER EYES! Kappa
[3:08:07] <+QueequegTheater> Reminder that human eyes literally don't process faster than 75 fps and any increases past that don't actually improve visuals, they only make it smoother
[3:08:08] <%BisoromiBear> Sword of Dios, grant me this lot.
[3:08:14] <glaciusinfinite> thats dumb that would never happen
[3:08:16] <X2Eliah> You SHOULD have

[3:08:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> She exchanged her sight in a contract to protect the Lot
[3:08:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MONEY
[3:08:20] <+gustavozxd> Yakuza is like MGS where it looks realistic so most people miss the fact that they're anime as fuck LUL

[3:12:17] <servicesuspension> He had to practice that one

[3:12:24] <Mahbonk> The dude who were hired to shutdown the whole street must have gotten a nice raise for the perfect timing
[3:12:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> "I can manage only 8 seconds..."
[3:12:28] <Mattais88> It's almost real estate time isn't it?
[3:12:32] <PsychoPearl> No Kiryu slander allowed
[3:12:33] <SomersaultJustice> TIME FOR REAL ESTATE
[3:12:37] <Spagheddies> @thetrashman_sc You are not seeing Kiryu hate FROM ME.
[3:12:38] <+Deko_> go baaack LUL
[3:12:38] <R3c0n31> How close is Kiryus minigame?
[3:12:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> This is absolutely Majima's game
[3:12:39] <+Undenizen> Seeking refuge from Pat. He's gone from angry to final form angry and it scares me
[3:12:41] <+gustavozxd> yaeh
[3:12:41] <strudel_h> I love kiryu, I love majima, I CAN'T PICK
[3:12:43] <@Menitta> Judgment is honestly a close second for best games from RGG Studios
[3:12:43] <RyuShinden> honestly, I agree
[3:12:43] <%Deft_Thought> Majima's story is so much better in Yakuza 0
[3:12:44] <$dudedude55555> dissing my boy kiryu?
[3:12:45] <Halospaz117> This game really does belong to Majima more
[3:12:46] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie is so IN.
[3:12:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MAJIMA IS THE BEST
[3:12:47] <Emotional_Sledgehammer> Stand "Rich Man's World"
[3:12:47] <@Menitta> For me at least
[3:12:48] <KaitlynnHere> I heard that actual Yakuza don’t show off their tattoos because it’s like a shameful flex. Like you’re relying on your tattoos to scare people instead of your grit
[3:12:49] <+QueequegTheater> @R3c0n31 soon
[3:12:49] <servicesuspension> KIRYU SHAMING MUST STOP
[3:12:51] <yukichocomilk> KIRYU WHO??
[3:12:51] <%Asuterisuku> Hi there Nishiki!
[3:12:53] <%Juriasu> Kiryu has to become interesting over 7 games so yeah
[3:12:53] <joshua_42> @strudel_h Pick both
[3:12:55] <%dukenux> Kiryu is a straight man
[3:12:56] <brian_peppers1> Kiryu will grow on you
[3:12:56] <RaidenRising> majima best boi
[3:12:56] <X2Eliah> Oh right Nishki is a thing
[3:12:57] <%Deft_Thought> Kiryu is just kinda here until he gets some motivation
[3:12:58] <+gustavozxd> Kiryu is slightly more interesting in the main series
[3:12:58] <diontmack> majima is absolutely the main character here
[3:12:58] <%marrs_bars> Is that slugger style? PogChamp
[3:12:59] <OblivionSword1> like hot take Zero to me is a Majima game
[3:13:00] <siamzero94> So Kiryu is still cool
[3:13:01] <MyNameIsRasus> KIRYU SLANDER WILL NOT STAND
[3:13:01] <+NotHereToStream> you would love Ichiban
[3:13:01] <strudel_h> I love majima but NO kiryu slander
[3:13:02] <hkgamingtv> STOP THE KIRYU SHAMING
[3:13:02] <+BusterRepukken> Kiryu has 6 other games
[3:13:04] <PiGreat> kiryu's story is more of a slow burn
[3:13:06] <RyuShinden> I love Kiryu, but Majima is way more interesting
[3:13:06] <joshua_42> YEAH BUT NISHIKI THO
[3:13:07] <assfordayz> Nishiki is such a bro
[3:13:08] <%dukenux> i will not stand for badmouthing him
[3:13:09] <exnuart> its cause shit goes down hard with majima
[3:13:10] <%gatorafan> Oh is that dude we fished an hour ago
[3:13:13] <%RaziWraith> Kiryu is just a stoic man okay??? BibleThump
[3:13:14] <Mahbonk> Ever since Yakuza 7 im seeing a lot more people disliking Kiryu in favor of the other protagonists
[3:13:15] <PsychoPearl> Majima is awesome, but I will not accept Kiryu slander bishidLewdMaji
[3:13:16] <X2Eliah> Man, Nishki looks like a weak-ass Majima clone
[3:13:20] <+QueequegTheater> I'd argue Kiryu's missions are more Nishiki's story than Kiryu
[3:13:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Nishiki's such a cool dude
[3:13:28] <%Lion_kun> too bad this is the only game where you play as Majima. I mean other than the three extra chapters in Kiwami 2. And Dead Souls
[3:13:28] <+gustavozxd> I LOOOOVE Kiryu in 2 cause his relationship with haruka in that is great
[3:13:29] <%nintega010> Kiryu and Majima make each other better imo
[3:13:30] <strudel_h> @joshua_42 you're right aeroPog
[3:13:32] <Mahbonk> Bless Nishiki
[3:13:33] <hkgamingtv> Nishiki is a bitch
[3:13:42] <assfordayz> Imagine if Nishiki had a WHITE shirt with that suit
[3:13:42] <%gatorafan> The duality of chat
[3:13:45] <%Asuterisuku> This whole game is someone's story OTHER than Kiryu's.
[3:13:47] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> My favorite Kiryu moments are mostly from 3, running the orphanage is wholesome af when you do it as man who could punch a whole country into submission
[3:13:49] <@Menitta> I like Kiryu's story more than Majima's but Majima himself is more interesting than Kiryu
[3:13:49] <KillMyPast> Kiryu had a hard life BibleThump
[3:13:50] <thetrashman_sc> kiryu is great yall are just nerds
[3:13:56] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:13:58] <PsychoPearl> Koi boi Fishiki
[3:14:00] <joshua_42> Nishiki is such a good boy
[3:14:00] <OblivionSword1> LUL
[3:14:00] <X2Eliah> ....
[3:14:02] <X2Eliah> what?
[3:14:05] <+fluffyderdelphin> .....
[3:14:05] <President_valentine> He's a koi boi
[3:14:06] <%LastHazzerd> yes.......
[3:14:06] <LVL1_Scumbag> Maybe he's named after the fish?
[3:14:07] <%RaziWraith> Fishiki-san LUL
[3:14:08] <brachydios777> Poor Nishki
[3:14:09] <Prevot> 🤔
[3:14:10] <Spagheddies> Majima is at his best in Zero. Kiryu is at his best in Kiwami 1, and Ichiban is at his best in Yaku7a
[3:14:10] <MyNameIsRasus> KOI BOIZZZZ
[3:14:11] <@Menitta> FISHIKI
[3:14:11] <%dukenux> koi boi
[3:14:12] <+QueequegTheater> @X2Eliah The nishiki koi
[3:14:13] <hkgamingtv> Fishiki I'm dieing
[3:14:13] <R3c0n31> V is felt that
[3:14:14] <Mattais88> Akiyama is legit the best though.
[3:14:16] <+gustavozxd> Kiryu's story in this game feels like it's more of a "who's who" for the rest of the games
[3:14:17] <%Asuterisuku> Nishikiyama Akira
[3:14:17] <%AMUSERNAME> I've got some Nishiki brand rice here, too.
[3:14:17] <Timarkot> FISHIKI
[3:14:22] <%LastHazzerd> Koi Boi!?!?
[3:14:22] <jaygee303> Nishiki did no wrong...
[3:14:26] <DedlokPM> @X2Eliah Woolie fished up Nishiki Carp earlier
[3:14:29] <KaitlynnHere> Fishyu
[3:14:32] <X2Eliah> Ohhh
[3:14:37] <%dukenux> do you like fish sticks, Nishiki?
[3:14:42] <%gatorafan> Once he reaches lvl30 he's going to be SO COOL... And get wrecked by electric attacks.
[3:14:43] <user_naim> Like a Fishiki
[3:14:44] <KonekoSilvertail> bc a carp is a baby dragon, like magikarp
[3:14:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's completely legit real estate
[3:14:48] <+QueequegTheater> Ichiban > Saejima > Majima > Akiyama > Kiryu > all those other losers
[3:14:50] <%Asuterisuku> His name means two mountains, though.
[3:14:57] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> *Whisper* It's free real estate.
[3:15:04] <X2Eliah> True, Ichiban is absolute best
[3:15:05] <@Menitta> I think Yagami is the best tbh
[3:15:08] <akman14> Who is breathing so heavily?
[3:15:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> man poor Pat, his KOTOR2 save is fucked
[3:15:12] <KaitlynnHere> @asuterisuku two mountains and a fish?
[3:15:13] <thetrashman_sc> ichiban is overrated
[3:15:14] <PsychoPearl> I love Ichiban <3
[3:15:17] <Spagheddies> @QueequegTheater That is a very respectable ranking. Especially the part with the loosers.
[3:15:19] <heartlesshealer> Greetings to umbrella stab boys
[3:15:19] <hkgamingtv> Mogul
[3:15:19] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Yagami? He's a chump.
[3:15:20] <%Deft_Thought> @Mahbonk I love Kiryu but he's always had a really inconsistent set of motivations when it comes to preserving the Tojo.
[3:15:25] <+UberWolfman> All husbandos are good boys.
[3:15:26] <X2Eliah> Wait what did Pat do now?
[3:15:29] <+kullumanati> Pat got super mad in koror. Buggy f$ck game
[3:15:29] <siamzero94> @abelincoln_catpuncher LUL
[3:15:29] <candidateplays> Majima > Majima > Majima > Majima > Everyone Else
[3:15:31] <Prevot> oh yeah I remember what's about to happen now LUL
[3:15:31] <+runegod20> @akman14 think that's someone hitting a ball, it's a bating cage and all
[3:15:32] <%Deft_Thought> It's a lot more visible when you frame him up with Majima in this game
[3:15:35] <@Solidus_113> SUIT UP
[3:15:39] <heartlesshealer> The game ate Pat's save. So KotoR cancelled
[3:15:44] <Nekros4442> fuck you ichiban is amazeballs
[3:15:45] <RyuShinden> Uhhh, just add a tie Kiryu
[3:15:45] <buffaloaff> hey woolz
[3:15:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> I wish
[3:15:46] <OkamiDude15> Oof
[3:15:48] <heartlesshealer> but it's Woolie and Little V time now
[3:15:50] <Darren716> Damnn
[3:15:50] <X2Eliah> big off
[3:15:51] <%nintega010> Dang it. I want the white suit
[3:15:51] <%Asuterisuku> Just you wait, Woolie.
[3:15:52] <Mahbonk> @Deft_Thought yeah pretty much sadly. 3 has to be my favorite version of him. he's kinda like seeing Majima in 0
[3:15:52] <+gustavozxd> oh my god he still doesn't have the suit I just noticed
[3:15:53] <Paperware> The pope deleted Pat's Kotor 2 purgatory baby
[3:15:53] <Spagheddies> Oh yikes. Poor pat.
[3:15:54] <R3c0n31> Kiryu has excellent taste in clothing...
[3:15:54] <hkgamingtv> I don't want to hear about Pat
[3:15:55] <KaitlynnHere> @heartlesshealer yikes

[3:16:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHAT CHAT! Has the sewer part happened?
[3:16:02] <+QueequegTheater> Oh man, Pat ended his stream, shit
[3:16:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> please say no
[3:16:05] <strudel_h> but kiryu looks good
[3:16:06] <Darren716> No
[3:16:07] <zhenthrim213> no
[3:16:10] <+NotHereToStream> no
[3:16:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @sonofthedeepsouth SOON
[3:16:10] <RaidenRising> no
[3:16:11] <siamzero94> Mister "Rotate your saves" has save problems?
[3:16:11] <%dukenux> not yet i think
[3:16:12] <%Asuterisuku> Seriously, Woolie, just wait.
[3:16:13] <hkgamingtv> no
[3:16:14] <owazowski> poor pat
[3:16:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can I punch fashion?
[3:16:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> oh thank god
[3:16:19] <+QueequegTheater> @sonofthedeepsouth not even close, we're only on chapter 5
[3:16:26] <%nintega010> @LVL1_Scumbag lol
[3:16:31] <hkgamingtv> I don't want to hear about Pat
[3:16:34] <KillMyPast> Dont disrespect Kiryu like that
[3:16:44] <X2Eliah> Kiryu is a super blank slate
[3:16:44] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu's a SLATE of some kind alright.
[3:16:45] <+gustavozxd> I feel like Woolie would prefer Kiryu if he had played the other games
[3:16:46] <Ipsenscastle> Pat's KOTOR problems were insane, the entire game just fucking died for real
[3:16:49] <thetrashman_sc> KIRYU HATE UP IN HERE
[3:16:49] <heartlesshealer> @siamzero94 Kotor has a bug that can just randomly happen to people. The fix ended up eating ALL of the saves
[3:16:51] <%Deft_Thought> @Mahbonk I dig Kiryu in Yak 1 being kind of a dick. And he does well playing against strong antagonists when they don't show up in the last 20 min.
[3:16:53] <RyuShinden> Majima just reacts differently
[3:16:54] <+mundanelotus> coolguy
[3:16:58] <assfordayz> Majima has 2 voices and is great
[3:16:58] <%LastHazzerd> Majima has been through more shit than Kiryu right now
[3:16:58] <brachydios777> @ipsenscastle Oh no
[3:17:00] <Mahbonk> The whole point of Majima's story in 0 is that he's a Caged animal
[3:17:03] <zanzibarian_hamster> Kiryu is basically the same person in every game
[3:17:04] <%BisoromiBear> Pat flew too close to the sun with all the mods
[3:17:05] <thetrashman_sc> HES NOT BORING
[3:17:06] <OldManDeckardCain> just in, woolie thinks kiryu is qui gon jin Kappa
[3:17:07] <+Deko_> ryu and ken? LUL
[3:17:07] <servicesuspension> They're Majima and Kiryu, Majima and Kiryu. One is stoic, the other is also stoic~
[3:17:09] <exnuart> as stoic as a guy from osaka can be
[3:17:10] <Darren716> Did someone clip Kotor dying on pat?
[3:17:11] <RaidenRising> joseph and jotaro
[3:17:11] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu has passionate and emotional moments, he's not completely a blank slate
[3:17:16] <Mahbonk> hence the name of his first chapter "The Gilded Cage"
[3:17:17] <+NotHereToStream> thats the difference between kansai and kanto
[3:17:18] <X2Eliah> Kiryu Gon Jin
[3:17:19] <strudel_h> I expect Majima to be like he is in other games lol
[3:17:19] <Mattais88> Jotaro vs Josuke
[3:17:21] <brachydios777> Btw literally Ryu and Ken right now
[3:17:25] <%nintega010> But when you have them together they create awesomeness.
[3:17:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> totally
[3:17:30] <+gustavozxd> in 0 for sure
[3:17:33] <Halospaz117> That's fair
[3:17:34] <+gustavozxd> I never noticed that tbh
[3:17:36] <hkgamingtv> L O L
[3:17:36] <heartlesshealer> Majima's great
[3:17:36] <RyuShinden> Kiryu is cool, but Majima is cool in his own way
[3:17:40] <Mahbonk> Rude Nishiki
[3:17:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1351446630420148224
[3:17:41] <+BusterRepukken> Kiryu gets 6 other games to flesh himself out, 0 is Majima's game
[3:17:44] <+RageCasanova> RIP Kotor 2
[3:17:45] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Kiryu gets more interesting from the tragedies in later games
[3:17:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> Stand still and get a cigarette out
[3:17:46] <+QueequegTheater> Kiryu becomes interesting once he realizes in later games that everyone except him, Majima, and like two other people is completely fucking incompetent
[3:17:48] <R3c0n31> Hare dare you you give an opinion that we dont like
[3:17:55] <strudel_h> Kiryu's a himbo
[3:17:57] <LycheeMusings> That's why Kiryu gets Haruka it makes his character way more interesting when he has a kid to take care of
[3:17:59] <Halospaz117> Kiryu calls Nishiki while talking to Nishiki
[3:17:59] <Ipsenscastle> @Darren716 it's more or less an entire hour of troubleshooting, it was painful
[3:17:59] <hkgamingtv> Kiryu is a god damned legend tho
[3:18:01] <%gatorafan> You just wait until Kiryu awakens the Dark Crime Energy.
[3:18:01] <assfordayz> Go battle!
[3:18:01] <@Menitta> Majima has Dead Souls too tho
[3:18:06] <Darren716> rad
[3:18:06] <@Menitta> LUL
[3:18:08] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu has no idea how to dress himself.
[3:18:10] <hkgamingtv> no share
[3:18:12] <servicesuspension> Sometimes you gotta mamoru
[3:18:13] <RyuShinden> @strudel_h No, Ichiban IS THE Himbo
[3:18:14] <amritadyne> who do they call to save the game anyway?

[3:21:03] <%Asuterisuku> That's one of two possible as a pair.
[3:21:03] <yeeyeyee> @WoolieVersus it also works if you grab him and do a heat move
[3:21:06] <MyNameIsRasus> There's a cooler one
[3:21:06] <alvaroeltz> not the best one
[3:21:07] <%gatorafan> Sasuga, Kyoudai!

[3:21:11] <brachydios777> Yeah
[3:21:26] <notsoy> there's three total team heat moves with nishiki

[3:21:32] <%Asuterisuku> It's the yellow there, Woolie.
[3:21:38] <@Menitta> there's one in 5 that ONLY HAPPENS if you have a carrot in your pocket
[3:21:44] <+runegod20> grabbing from behind, grabbing from the front, your back against a wall, the enemy's front against the wall, so many different ways to do it
[3:21:48] <assfordayz> I'm at 35/40 unique Heat moves on my game. Dunno whats the max number for compo
[3:22:02] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @Mattais88 It's cause back then RGG Studios didn't know how to make NPC allies fight worth shit.
[3:22:06] <TopLeftCenter> There's a list of heat moves and their conditions in the upgrade screen if you hit Y
[3:22:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> Trade CP with the gods

[3:22:49] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Majima's side game doesn't need the CP rewards at all, just FYI
[3:22:56] <OblivionSword1> defense 1
[3:23:05] <MyNameIsRasus> glass cannon
[3:23:05] <%Asuterisuku> You get skills later that overrule the need for that jacket.
[3:23:08] <%justmildlilac> STYLE SWITCHING
[3:23:09] <X2Eliah> Does defense matter?
[3:23:15] <assfordayz> Who needs defense anyway?
[3:23:16] <Spagheddies> Marginally.
[3:23:17] <notsoy> you can cancel attacks into style switch, which is cool
[3:23:19] <+runegod20> i think it's just flavor text
[3:23:24] <laguerrilha> Its sad there are only two chances of heat move combos with them
[3:23:27] <+QueequegTheater> @X2Eliah Only against the final boss and the Amon fights
[3:23:31] <assfordayz> We have dinners to complete, scre defense!
[3:23:46] <Prevot> gonna go catch mewtwo?
[3:23:46] <+nekomancerer> you can capture mewtwo now!
[3:23:47] <notsoy> master ball is a great heat move lol
[3:24:01] <@Menitta> Its not as fun as I want it to be. Yakuza Ishin has dedicated moves to switch styles. Here it still has the flash of switching
[3:24:03] <%justmildlilac> Anytime
[3:24:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> Bring on the fights!
[3:24:12] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @QueequegTheater And even then it's argueable. If you master all yer styles even Amon doesn't require Armor, just weapons.

[3:28:14] <+Chronobot> DID HE THO
[3:28:15] <servicesuspension> I love how he kept it out of spite
[3:28:21] <lovesosa236> and it has chains because he's not at full power LUL
[3:28:25] <%BisoromiBear> GTO didn't fit in at all

[3:28:37] <twoto858> Those are CHAINS?!

[3:28:43] <siamzero94> but not chains
[3:28:46] <KaitlynnHere> It’s the 80s, everyone is too high to notice
[3:28:51] <Mahbonk> which actually became a small running gag in the yakuza series

[3:28:55] <%dukenux> he stands out so much
[3:28:56] <%LastHazzerd> they're eithe rchains, or a pattern sewn to look like chains

[3:29:31] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Kiryu could have easily just gotten a basic black-jacket-white-shirt look with a solid color tie, but his brain saw this fucking abomination and thought "this is what non-crime people wear, right?"
[3:29:34] <assfordayz> Side quest time?

[3:30:45] <+runegod20> unfortately it requires another quest before it shows up

[3:30:49] <thetrashman_sc> the cyricz gamefaq guide
[3:30:51] <%BlueJoneleth> advance until real estate
[3:30:53] <siamzero94> You guys didn't do the producer sidestory yet?
[3:30:54] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus V, the trouble finder quest is available in Chapter 5
[3:30:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> V gotta trade CP with the gods for forbidden knowledge
[3:30:56] <@Menitta> you gotta do I think 3 quests in order to get the trouble finder
[3:30:58] <thetrashman_sc> Kreygasm
[3:31:05] <@Solidus_113> Bottom right shop
[3:31:05] <@Menitta> They're all great though
[3:31:13] <Hammatime8> What about *The stadium?*
[3:31:14] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Once you find the "gear shop" for Kiryu, any regular gear (non-DLC/CP) you obtain can be purchased over and over.
[3:31:16] <thetrashman_sc> kamurocho is great
[3:31:24] <hkgamingtv> go leafs go
[3:31:27] <@Menitta> At some point you memorize Kamurocho

[3:31:50] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Yeah, I practically know Kamuro's layout by memory at this point.
[3:31:54] <%ClericOfSparda> I love this game but I hate this combat
[3:32:03] <thetrashman_sc> the combat's fun tho
[3:32:04] <+QueequegTheater> @ClericOfSparda Play Yakuza 7 then
[3:32:09] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @ClericOfSparda Why???
[3:32:14] <ghoststalker> Apparently people who speedrun these games dislike that the order of the taxi destination lists change every game, so they lose time when they have to confirm taxi destinations
[3:32:21] <hkgamingtv> Yakuza is life
[3:32:26] <servicesuspension> did they do cars yet
[3:32:28] <Darren716> OHHH THAT'S A BASEBALL
[3:32:28] <zhenthrim213> The dragon engine combat is my favorite combat
[3:32:30] <+bPlusPlus> go to ero shop
[3:32:30] <atteroproxy> Should probably get the business first
[3:32:33] <+OroOreo> kickball?

[3:32:33] <Mattais88> Young Master?

[3:32:40] <+RJay80> Kickball?
[3:32:41] <heartlesshealer> kickball?
[3:32:41] <KeiPrime> kickball?
[3:32:42] <MrBodyGuardSir> The trouble finder is post business startup
[3:32:45] <+memequisition> we called it kickball in the states
[3:32:45] <Doctadaking> "I love the game but I h
[3:32:46] <cumurasame> there is an endgame item that can totally make Kiryu's combat so much smootherrr
[3:32:46] <exnuart> kickball
[3:32:50] <%ClericOfSparda> I felt like the combat was annoying because everything got interrupted or blocked past a basic 2-3 hit combo
[3:32:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Go Soccer tho, that's the real shit
[3:32:51] <%SirGO0SE> the high difficulties on this are fucking RAD
[3:32:54] <Pookiedaexzile> BRUH
[3:32:54] <%LastHazzerd> didn't think to call it something else
[3:32:56] <%tank7013> Can you press block during a grab to turn them around or was that only dragon engine?
[3:32:57] <servicesuspension> soccer baseball
[3:32:57] <+OroOreo> what the fuck is baseball soccer
[3:32:57] <hkgamingtv> not Kickball, SoccerBaseball
[3:32:58] <@Menitta> Baseball with a dodgeball
[3:32:59] <+memequisition> soccer baseball
[3:33:01] <Darren716> It's what youre describing
[3:33:02] <thetrashman_sc> dragon engine combat was shit in 6 but pretty good in kiwami 2
[3:33:03] <%The_Timo> That soccer baseball you just said
[3:33:04] <+QueequegTheater> @zhenthrim213 Ugh no way, 0 and Kiwami are way better than sluggish drunk Kiryu in dragon engine
[3:33:04] <PanicSwytch> My school called it Richter ball
[3:33:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> Baseball, but you kick a dodgeball
[3:33:06] <%ClericOfSparda> so there's no reason to do bigger than a 3 hit combo
[3:33:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:33:08] <Prevot> the fuck is soccer baseball or kickball?
[3:33:08] <TheHeroAppears> baseball with a kickball
[3:33:10] <Darren716> It's baseball with a rubber kickball
[3:33:11] <%AMUSERNAME> Baseball with a rubber ball you roll and kick.
[3:33:11] <+hukurowl> wtf
[3:33:11] <R3c0n31> Baseball but you kick a ball
[3:33:11] <exnuart> soccer baseball

[3:33:32] <Indigo_Automaton> sportsball
[3:33:32] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:33:32] <KaitlynnHere> No
[3:33:33] <%ClericOfSparda> I loved Majima's combat tho
[3:33:33] <hkgamingtv> wtf is Kickball?
[3:33:33] <+bPlusPlus> SOCC BALL
[3:33:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CANADIANS ARE WIERD
[3:33:33] <PanicSwytch> Why montreal
[3:33:36] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> Kickball is baseball but kicking
[3:33:37] <@Menitta> Montreal said "What would France call it?"
[3:33:39] <AngryAsian5> Yup, Soccer-Baseball
[3:33:39] <KaitlynnHere> Canada is wrong
[3:33:39] <lovesosa236> ball
[3:33:41] <%emperordread> We're talking softball, From Maine to San Diego
[3:33:41] <HollowMan190> terrible
[3:33:42] <+jhat12345> MONTREAL IS WRONG
[3:33:42] <RaidenRising> why
[3:33:43] <KeiPrime> soccer baseball is rc cola
[3:33:45] <zhenthrim213> @QueequegTheater i just love swinging guys around in crowds and the ragdoll
[3:33:46] <%emperordread> We're talking softball
[3:33:48] <exnuart> why does montreal need to name things differently
[3:33:48] <Ultimatefool> American Football-Baseball
[3:33:49] <%Asuterisuku> The Training Gear is super good.
[3:33:50] <%ThisIsLloyd> should be extra xp??? maybe
[3:33:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Maybe more money?
[3:33:56] <R3c0n31> i think its Money gain
[3:33:57] <chainsaw105> the trick to this is to look at Kiryu's bat
[3:33:59] <+Arkbat11> Canadian flag literally is just soccer baseball written across a sheet
[3:34:00] <+runegod20> how would it have worked in this game?
[3:34:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Soccer Baseball just sounds weird because Soccer is Football, so you're saying FootballBaseball
[3:34:01] <%Javaa01> In the other games, it ruins your defense stats, but doubles your XP gain
[3:34:05] <KaitlynnHere> Footbase ball
[3:34:16] <%dukenux> basefootball
[3:34:21] <thetrashman_sc> those are virtua fighter machines later in the timeline
[3:34:22] <%ThisIsLloyd> O H that's right i'm dumb no xp this game only sweet sweet moolah
[3:34:22] <KeiPrime> ball foot base
[3:34:26] <hkgamingtv> you'll see
[3:34:33] <%Asuterisuku> I think it's all timing and aim in 0.
[3:34:37] <%dukenux> foot base torture
[3:34:41] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> Coming from the country that calls everything sportsball
[3:34:42] <assfordayz> What about Handball?
[3:34:50] <%Asuterisuku> I was always awful at this.
[3:34:50] <thetrashman_sc> they always change the fuckin batting minigame in every game
[3:34:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> sportsball
[3:34:58] <hkgamingtv> DO BASEBALL
[3:35:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh! That's a Baseball!
[3:35:05] <KeiPrime> the one in six is kinda bunk cause you have to use the touchpad
[3:35:07] <ghoststalker> OH IT’S A BASEBALL
[3:35:11] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> Hand ball that’s when they slap your dick
[3:35:11] <%dukenux> JAGWARS
[3:35:14] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu will always git it if you get the timing right.
[3:35:23] <@Menitta> Oh yeah this is how the baseball game worked in the older ones
[3:35:26] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:35:28] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:35:28] <Lion_kun> there's a tell
[3:35:29] <atteroproxy> Kiwami 2 is way better
[3:35:30] <hkgamingtv> this one soooo hard
[3:35:32] <astrophizz> this is way harder than in later games
[3:35:33] <PsychoPearl> LUL
[3:35:35] <@Menitta> I prefer it in Dragon Engine
[3:35:35] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah it's fucking nightmarish
[3:35:35] <%Lion_kun> the moment he clinches up, hit the ball
[3:35:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> Baseball is rough in this game
[3:35:38] <%LastHazzerd> it's not the best
[3:35:39] <radar410> This is way easier on keyboard and mouse LUL
[3:35:39] <Nekros4442> theres always a tell
[3:35:40] <exnuart> kiwami 2 is much better
[3:35:40] <Ultimatefool> THREE OUTO
[3:35:42] <TheHeroAppears> I hate all the baseball minigames LUL
[3:35:43] <%emperordread> "Put the taget in the centre, pull the switch" - Shinji
[3:35:46] <alvaroeltz> really easy with a mouse, if its the same as kiwami 1
[3:35:46] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yakuza... what 4 onward? has the good one
[3:35:47] <ferbeholds> no balls
[3:35:47] <+runegod20> it looks hard, but at least there's a consistant strat
[3:35:48] <KeiPrime> this one is pretty cool, but very different from the one in 6 and 7
[3:35:48] <Darren716> Yeah the Judgment one is hard, luckily you can cheat super hard
[3:35:50] <hkgamingtv> yeah fuck this version
[3:35:50] <MyNameIsRasus> 7 is better
[3:35:51] <KaitlynnHere> Stick foot ball base
[3:35:52] <@Menitta> Its way more interesting in the Dragon Engine
[3:35:52] <R3c0n31> i forgot they changed this
[3:35:53] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> He stops moving at the right timing. This one is so hard
[3:35:54] <Mahbonk> oh nvm its the gold minigame that suck ass in Dragon Engine
[3:35:55] <blackriderkick> Yakuza kiwami 2 and 7 is way better
[3:35:55] <majindusto> GIT GUD WOOLIE
[3:35:56] <notsoy> baseball is pretty hard in this one and K1, K2/6/7 is much better
[3:35:56] <DedlokPM> @Menitta This IS dragon engine tho mogsHmm
[3:35:57] <%Javaa01> @atteroproxy Except for needing to grind it 30 times to get your heavy attack and heat move
[3:35:57] <chainsaw105> @WoolieVersus basically just line up your shot then watch Kiryu's bat for the flinch
[3:35:57] <%rhodou> not great
[3:35:58] <astrophizz> it's fine in Kiwami 2
[3:35:58] <%Asuterisuku> They never throw balls.
[3:35:59] <thetrashman_sc> no like this is different from 5 which is different from 4 which is different from 3
[3:36:03] <servicesuspension> I never understood how anyone could ever hit a baseball
[3:36:04] <Ultimatefool> Baseball minigame in 5 is the best, since you get an ACTUAL baseball player to do it
[3:36:05] <+nekomancerer> I loved the baseball league in 6 tho
[3:36:06] <thetrashman_sc> its bizarre
[3:36:06] <Mahbonk> *golf
[3:36:08] <heartlesshealer> aiming as opposed to pure timing feels weird now
[3:36:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> At least the golf ball is stationary
[3:36:15] <akman14> Is there anything more posh than gold class?
[3:36:19] <hkgamingtv> HOMEOOO RUNOO
[3:36:20] <KeiPrime> remember the batting game in link between worlds? That one was pretty cool as far as home run derby games go
[3:36:23] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Watch for when Kiryu tenses up the bat
[3:36:25] <%BinaryFireball> I always suck so much at the batting cage games
[3:36:25] <%ChoculaUltra> nice
[3:36:28] <jaygee303> L
[3:36:29] <astrophizz> the golf mingame is really more of a puzzle game imo
[3:36:33] <%ClericOfSparda> this mini game is easy as hell with a mouse and keyboard
[3:36:35] <Mahbonk> damnit, V
[3:36:37] <assfordayz> I dunno how this points works
[3:36:45] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Woolie's famous depth perception comming into play
[3:36:46] <MyNameIsRasus> it's curving
[3:36:48] <Mattais88> Golf carts arn't real cars anyways. They're less dangerous riding mowers
[3:36:49] <deafmelone> I play Junpei in P4AU does that count?
[3:36:55] <ferbeholds> PogChamp
[3:36:55] <R3c0n31> Curve ball
[3:36:57] <zedravan> less depth perception than majima Kappa
[3:36:58] <KeiPrime> keep your eye on the ball
[3:37:06] <hkgamingtv> it's rough
[3:37:08] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus DOn't watch the ball, watch Kiryu's bat
[3:37:09] <blackriderkick> The golf minigame in Yakuza 3 is fucking legit
[3:37:11] <KaitlynnHere> He’s doing pretty good
[3:37:14] <Halospaz117> Actually, keep your eye on Kiryu, he stiffens up when you should swing
[3:37:14] <%Lion_kun> Woolz, there's a trick, the moment he tenses the bat, swing.
[3:37:15] <jaygee303> “I have 20/20 vison”
[3:37:21] <+Zebylth> focus on kiryu, he stops moving when you have to swing
[3:37:22] <Daxalog> Thats golf
[3:37:23] <%Javaa01> Yeah the later courses have evil throws
[3:37:24] <%dukenux> a
[3:37:25] <majindusto> DISAPPOINTED KIRYU
[3:37:29] <@Menitta> He should look at the right Home Run sign to see the ball more
[3:37:31] <KeiPrime> you know i never did this looking at the bat, but i guess that IS a better tell
[3:37:34] <exnuart> later games get golf and its the best
[3:37:34] <+condemned_15> The Baseball mini games always change every game
[3:37:36] <Darren716> LUL
[3:37:37] <KaiserMario> Bowling is better in these games
[3:37:39] <thetrashman_sc> you actually have to be decent at the golf minigame if you wanna get to the secret boss in 3
[3:37:43] <TheHeroAppears> tape your stick LUL
[3:37:44] <%justmildlilac> LOOK AT THE BAT, NOT THE BALL TRUST ME
[3:37:47] <KaitlynnHere> I think the next Yakuza game is like that when it comes to the batting cages
[3:37:51] <%Lion_kun> too late
[3:37:52] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:37:53] <assfordayz> LMAO
[3:37:57] <%Lion_kun> look at the bat
[3:38:00] <+bPlusPlus> balls
[3:38:02] <thetrashman_sc> the tense is actually a good tell ngl
[3:38:06] <%Asuterisuku> Balls out.
[3:38:08] <SherlockianHero> The best disappointed Kiryu is Pocket Circut.
[3:38:08] <%Lion_kun> he stops rotating it
[3:38:11] <+runegod20> from what I hear, it's something to do with looking at the bat and hitting at a certain point of the animation
[3:38:11] <hkgamingtv> SoR = DO BASEBALL
[3:38:13] <plughead_> the Dragon Engine's baseball minigame is so much better
[3:38:13] <KaitlynnHere> I love looking at balls
[3:38:14] <thetrashman_sc> but theres more than one way to do it
[3:38:16] <TheHeroAppears> look at kiryu's asshole and when it tenses swing
[3:38:17] <ferbeholds> ohh thats a baseball
[3:38:18] <Fleshlight_Guzzler> Fleshlight_Guzzler is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel!
[3:38:19] <Fleshlight_Guzzler> Fleshlight_Guzzler gifted a Tier 1 sub to derrickslays!
[3:38:19] <assfordayz> Hey batta batta
[3:38:22] <R3c0n31> Look at the bat, not Kiryus sexy
[3:38:28] <@Menitta> you had it down at first
[3:38:30] <%justmildlilac> When he stops twirling the bat, swing
[3:38:37] <Darren716> Ball timing is better
[3:38:38] <Afroperonista> KappaPride
[3:38:39] <servicesuspension> you're close to an achievement
[3:38:40] <+Idziman> I hate this minigame
[3:38:46] <%Lion_kun> the instant the bat stops, swing, you don't have to think
[3:38:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:38:48] <Darren716> Just gotta notice curves
[3:39:08] <+runegod20> it's only 300 yen, we can play this mini games for a literally week and be good on money
[3:39:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:39:09] <KaitlynnHere> Look at dem balls
[3:39:09] <+QueequegTheater> Oh look Woolie stopped listening to chat and instantly hit a home run
[3:39:11] <jaygee303> For advertising ball hygiene he should really be better at this
[3:39:11] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[3:39:15] <servicesuspension> this shit's cursed
[3:39:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie this won't give Kiryu Slugger Style no matter how hard you try.
[3:39:30] <$CrowbarFacelift> I look at Kiryu more than the ball, the timing is when he tenses up to swing
[3:39:34] <thetrashman_sc> @QueequegTheater whats with the cheek Kappa
[3:39:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[3:39:49] <+Sebenoth> if this is the beginner one, then how bad are the others?!
[3:39:51] <KeiPrime> man i like the batting cage mini games, even when they change it up
[3:39:54] <+runegod20> woolie would be doing much better if kiryu was holding a manscape razor
[3:39:55] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:40:00] <Doctadaking> Once Kiryu stops moving the bat, swing
[3:40:01] <majindusto> YOUUUU'RE OUTTA HERE!!!
[3:40:04] <Afroperonista> like 1 minute earlier LUL
[3:40:05] <OblivionSword1> good try good try
[3:40:09] <%ClericOfSparda> just use a mouse. the cursor automatically stays in one place
[3:40:15] <jaygee303> He would have lost that stand battle so easily
[3:40:16] <hkgamingtv> better in Dragon Engine
[3:40:16] <%FrostedZaibatsu> The angle of the camera sucks too

[3:40:33] <redrins> so we're doing mahjong right?
[3:40:33] <$CrowbarFacelift> Yeah it sucks that Kiryu's body can obscure the ball sometimes
[3:40:35] <atteroproxy> But busniess

[3:41:23] <SherlockianHero> Oda: *checks watch in front of Cafe Alps*

[3:42:56] <pricklypissant> Is his hat his power limiter?

[3:43:04] <KeiPrime> I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD

[3:43:30] <%baka_sugoi> R U S H
[3:43:31] <+Deko_> how many times did he fight this shakedown?
[3:43:35] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Use the style switch to start in brawler then switch to rush to dodge
[3:43:36] <OblivionSword1> with speed
[3:43:36] <assfordayz> Just use weapon heat moves
[3:43:38] <%Asuterisuku> XY though.
[3:43:46] <MyNameIsRasus> i wonder hou much of this lp has been mr shakedown fights
[3:43:49] <Hammatime8> @velgaduere Well, then his power is stupid too
[3:43:49] <Doctadaking> My fighting style for shakedowns is locking on to him, getting real close to him, and dashing around him once he attacks
[3:43:51] <+runegod20> rush got those dodges, plus heat on a successful quick step which is good
[3:43:53] <servicesuspension> lame it out
[3:43:56] <@Solidus_113> remember weapon heat moves
[3:43:59] <MyNameIsRasus> i'd wager like a good 5% at this point

[3:46:28] <notsoy> the hammer heat move is only in beast
[3:46:32] <+runegod20> isn't the fan suppose to have a heat move?
[3:46:32] <%Asuterisuku> Two and a half.
[3:46:32] <assfordayz> So fan doesnt have heat move
[3:46:37] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Beast-style can bearhug this SoB.
[3:46:44] <%Asuterisuku> He didn't have enough heat in idle to use it.
[3:47:04] <Estwilde> Losing money makes Mr. Shakedown angry 😠
[3:47:14] <Mattais88> Remember when you were low enough level that a Royale was a full heal, and not needing 3 to top off?
[3:47:20] <atteroproxy> If he gets that grab, he's whoopin that ass
[3:47:21] <%gatorafan> @estwilde, losing money makes me angry too
[3:47:25] <%Asuterisuku> X Y would probably work in Thug too for more damage.
[3:47:29] <Estwilde> @gatorafan yep im there with him

[3:49:58] <servicesuspension> close
[3:50:05] <+runegod20> rush is also kind of weak in general without the Y finishers, which do 99% of it's damage

[3:55:59] <OblivionSword1> it's basically Royal Release
[3:56:04] <deafmelone> Alpha Counter
[3:56:06] <+runegod20> the low health stuff doesn't always come up but there's usually nice stuff that require you to get it first
[3:56:07] <hkgamingtv> of course
[3:56:12] <+NopeBadguy> HOW DO YOU PARRY SOUND
[3:56:13] <KillMyPast> @WoolieVersus Just a heads up. You need to press the guard button at a certain time rather than holding it.
[3:56:14] <%Asuterisuku> Parrie Sound.
[3:56:15] <hkgamingtv> it's near Owen Sound
[3:56:15] <Mattais88> Perry not Parry
[3:56:21] <zhenthrim213> is next countereal
[3:56:25] <zhenthrim213> it
[3:56:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sound is a Nautical term
[3:56:32] <thetrashman_sc> tiger drop is the greatest move in action games
[3:56:35] <hkgamingtv> Muskoka
[3:56:39] <whirly25> A sound? Perry the sound!
[3:56:40] <+runegod20> wall crushing is rad

[3:57:28] <El_GhostV1> That one works on shakedown
[3:57:35] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus As Kiryu, the only type of wep you need to get is brass knuckles.
[3:57:36] <+runegod20> being between a wall and an enemy honestly isn't that hard
[3:57:48] <Doctadaking> Doesnt each style have a back-to-wall heat move for Kiryu?
[3:57:49] <thetrashman_sc> tiger drop is my favorite fuckin move
[3:57:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[3:57:55] <%HollowedIdjit> @woolieversus Counter Heat Moves work on Shakedowns

[3:58:55] <$hattrick61> not banned, just nerfed
[3:58:56] <@akuda_bar> it was, and they had to reduce the alcohol content
[3:58:58] <Estwilde> Redline the small bottle with the meter on it that tells you to stop drinking at the halfway mark
[3:58:59] <+Wiithan6> they had to change the recipe
[3:59:04] <%ThisIsLloyd> 4loko should still be banned for tasting so bad
[3:59:06] <Indigo_Automaton> They are still around but they're just alcohol, not caffeine
[3:59:07] <heartlesshealer> it was until they changed recipe
[3:59:07] <atteroproxy> OG Four Loko was super drugs

[3:59:45] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You generally should be locking on anyway

[4:01:01] <$CrowbarFacelift> These cameras are intense
[4:01:04] <TheHeroAppears> when majima's not on screen everyone should be asking where's Majima
[4:01:08] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> This is the only game in which Majima is playable anyways, let him have it.
[4:01:09] <+Idziman> Majima's great, but I still prefer Kiryu
[4:01:10] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Majima is the only thing that can save Dead Souls
[4:01:12] <Hammatime8> But BOTH of them!
[4:01:17] <astrophizz> for a little bit in Kiwami 2
[4:01:23] <%r0chelimit> You can play him in dead souls

[4:01:32] <Estwilde> Yakuza is so cool
[4:01:35] <+KymeraKirsty> Kiwami 2 stuff is cool
[4:01:38] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Kiryu kinda steps aside in 4 and 5
[4:01:39] <TheHeroAppears> @Javaa01 it's so bad lol.
[4:01:45] <SherlockianHero> Oda: *has aged 5 years waiting*
[4:01:46] <jorniev> he has his most underrated song in yakuza dead souls

[4:02:40] <@Menitta> IT REALLY DID
[4:02:43] <ghoststalker> Dead Souls is only good for Get to the Top Majima version
[4:02:43] <+MordoPrime> @redrins only worth it for the majima cutscenes and GET TO THE TOP
[4:02:44] <OokamiDen02> literall
[4:02:46] <Halospaz117> FUCKING TIMING
[4:02:46] <jorniev> dead souls should have been more like dead rising instead of call of duty zombies
[4:02:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Revolver is better than either Redemption
[4:02:50] <OokamiDen02> Literally
[4:02:51] <majindusto> IT'S NOT SHITTY THO
[4:02:57] <+Trickyvic13> speak of the zombie

[4:03:32] <+Deko_> giorno also changed
[4:03:34] <Halospaz117> I mean, Daisuke Ono was Jotaro in the games before the anime, right?
[4:03:38] <OokamiDen02> her voice is so good for Jolyne
[4:03:40] <@Menitta> They recast Josuke
[4:03:42] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Is this the end of the stream?
[4:03:44] <%Lion_kun> Okuyasu was
[4:03:44] <mortificent> anime Josuke is better than game Josuke
[4:03:47] <TheGershon> Most likely yes
