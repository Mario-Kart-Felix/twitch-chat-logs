[1:14:23] <%wolfofsound> nah it just eats your ass Kappa
[1:14:24] <+Bt_Robot> It's also a neutral creature, so if you trick another enemy into attacking it, the mimic will fight that enemy instead of you.

[1:31:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus just load the first save and don't fight the spider
[1:31:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> maybe punch it while your light is on it
[1:31:30] <hntronium> Maybe you should restart or reload a save where you have more health
[1:31:31] <dukenux> its a Stand with a MININAL range.
[1:31:31] <%sileo_patronus> walking backwards is also an option
[1:31:34] <Shishi1205> do not punch
[1:31:37] <+profanityincluded> juke it around the room like you were doin
[1:31:38] <TheArrow_> just shun goku satsu the spider

[1:32:19] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it's out of your reach
[1:32:22] <%sileo_patronus> no
[1:32:22] <speximillian> Maybe trap it by the door?
[1:32:25] <trashcansan> oh god i hope not

[1:32:33] <floralkami> @maskofmichael wouldn't be the weirdest out of context quote
[1:32:33] <Jack_of_No_Trades> You need to scare him into the opposite corner, near the door
[1:32:33] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> There are more Health Potions
[1:32:34] <+QueequegTheater> Reload the first save and don't fight the spider
[1:32:36] <Agami23> you barely did anything
[1:32:39] <+amurter19> Speedrun it
[1:32:40] <Finakala> Yeah you can push it around to nearer the entrance
[1:32:41] <PlumpPotatoRump> it wouldnt take too long because u know what to do
[1:32:42] <Cozy90> get a wlife woolie!
[1:32:43] <Mendin> Speedrun!
[1:32:44] <hntronium> You are in fact doing it the hard way
[1:32:45] <floralkami> You need a tonic...
[1:32:46] <fuji_92> you can do it Woolz, just juke it to the other side of the room
[1:32:53] <+fr0zach> it is possible to zone the spider, but it's a bit tricky.
[1:32:55] <dukenux> jermaPluto je
[1:32:58] <+winds_0f_change> use th light to move the spider to the other side if the room
[1:33:00] <galabuddy> @WoolieVersus kite the spider towards the door?
[1:33:00] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Kite the spider away, point the light at it while you're interacting, doable

[1:35:24] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus You can totally do it, but keep tha light on her, even while reading
[1:35:28] <SomersaultJustice> is there a way to get more health?
[1:35:29] <usurper_sos> The spider is OP
[1:35:31] <hntronium> If only you had more health more like
[1:35:32] <dukenux> that would be a TERRYFYING mechanic
[1:35:34] <$cureneckbeard> try big jump
[1:35:34] <Zehdre> Woolie doesn't know how to walk sideways.
[1:35:36] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus if you load the first save you can get back to this point in like 5 minutes max
[1:35:46] <MisterVantes> You can kill it you just need more health and a weapon
[1:35:49] <Jack_of_No_Trades> if only the controls werent the worst possible for this maneuver
[1:35:58] <@Squdnate> @mayorrev You can post the clip again if you want, updated so now Moobot shouldn't be up your ass about it :P

[1:37:20] <floralkami> Now
[1:37:24] <hntronium> By trying to save time, you wasted time
[1:37:26] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus this isn't a fighting game tho
[1:37:26] <MyNameIsRasus> 10 minutes ago
[1:37:27] <tangoragahn> NEVER SHOULD HAVE TRIED
[1:37:28] <NegaScottsuper> punch all the things
[1:37:28] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Need to do all of forest
[1:37:28] <KasiCrafter> How can you hope to win footsies with a spider if it has 6 more fet than you?

[1:37:58] <%jinking79> shitdamn
[1:38:09] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @mayorrev
[1:38:13] <+profanityincluded> woolie straight bustlin
[1:38:16] <VJdarkworld> woolie going QA mode
[1:38:21] <EliahNebb> narrator: we would take damage
[1:38:25] <Jack_of_No_Trades> it was rad
[1:38:28] <CAPSLOCKlive> Woolie needs a QA Emote
[1:38:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> It was pretty cool
[1:38:32] <MyNameIsRasus> guys I don't think Woolie is quite enjoying this
[1:38:38] <Doppelganger4827> SPIDERS! PUNCH EM!
[1:38:40] <%jinking79> hard backdown
[1:38:42] <+primax104> woolie wants to play DMC when he is actually playing RE
[1:38:45] <%wolfofsound> nothing wastes time more than having fun
[1:38:47] <OldOnyx> fun is a waste of time
[1:38:48] <+profanityincluded> its a survival horror game woolie
[1:38:51] <hntronium> Woolie hates this just like how he'll hate Death Stranding
[1:38:52] <ChrisM341> Spider Banned at Evo
[1:39:02] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie you need to get into RE2 mode
[1:39:03] <SquigglyLizard> yeyeye
[1:39:06] <vierleger> Yeyeye
[1:39:13] <nichos7> He says he liked what he's played of Death Stranding
[1:39:14] <iswearimjustdandy> @hntronium he already played ds, said he liked it
[1:39:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> STOP EnJoying yourself
[1:39:26] <+profanityincluded> Spiders rise up
[1:39:35] <Jontman42> do you think games are silly little things?
[1:39:37] <Sasha_conyst> Nothing wastes time like trying tosave time.
[1:39:37] <dukenux> theres something perverse as making Woolie the protagonist of a game from the genre Pat specifically likes
[1:39:39] <floralkami> Woolie tried to fuck around and life said "No"
[1:39:41] <+QueequegTheater> arthropods live in a society
[1:39:47] <dukenux> *in
[1:39:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> run into that red thing for lp funsies
[1:39:58] <+NarcissistCactus> tank controls in a nutshell
[1:39:58] <%jinking79> If it a Ghost Spider fuck everything
[1:40:01] <%GraceTBM> the controls are a stylistic choice
[1:40:02] <vierleger> Well, Pat can't be the hero. He's the monster.
[1:40:07] <Bigyanno> I love this Woolie Shuffle the model is doing when it walks
[1:40:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:12] <+Darren716> Congrats woolie you figured out survival horror
[1:40:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Remerei should make a character action game next and make Pat the protagonist
[1:40:16] <+OwlLightningMage> Destroy your society. Buster to the heavens.
[1:40:19] <Cozy90> Tank controls are great woolie. I wish real life had tank controls
[1:40:24] <$cureneckbeard> Pat would be unable to jump as high due to his short legs
[1:40:28] <%jinking79> oh shit i feel bad for Minh now
[1:40:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> @MyNameIsRasus The irony alone would be great
[1:40:39] <dukenux> so a SH rust dimension
[1:40:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Punchmom scared me with the mucus cloud
[1:40:48] <Doppelganger4827> there's a movie called Big A$$ Spiders
[1:40:51] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus How accurate is that run animation?
[1:40:53] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I am a dead man then
[1:41:04] <dukenux> yeah but what if your foot get stuck!
[1:41:04] <+profanityincluded> now dont fuck up getting the firepoker, and we are good
[1:41:09] <floralkami> Can you not strafe with tank controls? I could've sworn that was the whole point
[1:41:18] <scoot_io> I mean, tripping happens at the worst times
[1:41:24] <tangoragahn> If only it were a world where monsters rule
[1:41:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you gonna crush it
[1:41:28] <%GraceTBM> floralking that's a hundred percent the opposit
[1:41:34] <dukenux> it always happens in the horror
[1:41:37] <ChrisM341> With tank controls you can only turn and move forward and backwards
[1:41:37] <+profanityincluded> save that health drink
[1:41:44] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami the point of tank controls is that you can continue your direction easily with fixed camera angle changes
[1:42:02] <dukenux> and in nightmares yoyr legs feel like made if lead instead
[1:42:04] <Bazmiku> obviously someone needs to make an Invisible clone with Pat as the protag to balance it out.
[1:42:12] <dukenux> *of
[1:42:35] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater but are the left and right on the left stick just dead? I thought the character turned with the right stick still
[1:42:38] <Broand> Punchmom with death stranding commentary
[1:42:43] <%wolfofsound> I'm burping my stomach with farts :)
[1:42:49] <%GraceTBM> honestly it's weird to watch this streamed by two composed people
[1:42:54] <vierleger> Make a character action game, but Pat is the Vergil and Woolie is the Nero.
[1:43:05] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami no, that's normal controls
[1:43:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you've got it
[1:43:24] <+QueequegTheater> Tank controls have left/right to rotate
[1:43:29] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE he's playing it! sorry I'm late
[1:43:38] <%GraceTBM> this mentality is how people get lost and check rooms multiple times
[1:43:47] <PlumpPotatoRump> @tucker0603 welcoooome
[1:43:49] <%wolfofsound> or a.........tank
[1:43:51] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige is Nero, Pat is Vergil, and Woolie is V
[1:43:52] <+primax104> a tank woolie
[1:43:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Tucker0603 You missed Woolie punching a spider and then dying. It was awesome
[1:43:56] <Finakala> 18 wheel woolie
[1:43:57] <%GraceTBM> what, is that NOT how you walk around rooms?
[1:43:58] <+primax104> thats the point
[1:44:08] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater oh..... Oh barf apatFist
[1:44:11] <+DigbyMayor> That one you can probably punch
[1:44:19] <dukenux> ack
[1:44:19] <%GraceTBM> it should really just pause the game at descriptions
[1:44:26] <hntronium> spiderlings slaughtered
[1:44:27] <dukenux> it should
[1:44:31] <Cozy90> just ask pat
[1:44:31] <Broand> the shield
[1:44:35] <CherrieVelvet> enemies not pausing during text seems like an oversight
[1:44:39] <+profanityincluded> youll have to juke them for flavor text
[1:44:39] <Doppelganger4827> get me pictures of Spider-Woolie!
[1:44:41] <+profanityincluded> work for that lore
[1:44:47] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami it's specifically to get around old design problems. If up is always forward then fixed camera angle changes don't screw up your movement direction

[1:46:32] <hntronium> Punchmom smart
[1:46:34] <DedlokPM> Tank controls were both because of "camera change consistent movement" but also (and mostly) because the original dualshock only had the d-pad for movement
[1:46:37] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie figured it out
[1:46:39] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus SHOW PAT
[1:46:44] <hntronium> Ye
[1:46:47] <hntronium> Show Pat
[1:46:52] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami yes, because tank controls are only applicable with fixed camera angles

[1:54:04] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> If I absorbed myself into my own anus and it turned out it held a fantasy land is that an isekai?

[1:54:28] <vierleger> Mark Twain wrote isekai
[1:54:28] <simulationbard> That pick up girl's in a dungeon's not an Isekai just a fantsy thing
[1:54:31] <+kekkerscrew> SAO isn't really an Isekai because the characters don't actually go anywhere. They're just playing computer games it's just that they can't turn it off.
[1:54:32] <dukenux> Is LOST an isekai?
[1:54:36] <%UrsulaCat> minesweeper isekai
[1:54:37] <Sasha_conyst> So I'm a spider so what
[1:54:37] <Doppelganger4827> Outbreak Company was a funny one
[1:54:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wizard of Oz? Also an isekai
[1:54:39] <+gustavozxd> im stuck in a world where everyone is a girl and they want my dick!
[1:54:43] <Finakala> Fuck, LOST might actually be a legit isekai
[1:54:45] <DedlokPM> "Is It Okay to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon" is'n an Isekai tho. rooSmug
[1:54:45] <xeros720> I suplexed the princess and opened up a pet shop in another world
[1:54:46] <usurper_sos> Hey, it's that painting
[1:54:48] <Sokumotanaka> Oh I'm surprised woolie got this far, pat was super wrong...not that THAT'S hard
[1:54:49] <Bigyanno> in SAO they get trapped so it's an isekai
[1:54:51] <Wado_3000> @PsychoFlash1 if by goo you mean instrumentality than sure
[1:54:51] <ECRead> @dukenux .... FUCK
[1:54:53] <EyeFarted> Minecraft is the ultimate isekai
[1:54:54] <shamuzu> its THE painting
[1:54:54] <%GraceTBM> the objective reality is all chemical
[1:54:55] <+knackirontarkus> that one KOF novel about Iori Yagami getting isekai-ed
[1:54:55] <+Lord0Mugen> @gustavozxd yep. every isekai
[1:54:59] <rytisone> Jumanji is isekai
[1:54:59] <pseudo888> @Wado_3000 yeah
[1:55:04] <zenith0111> Is Bible Black a isekai

[1:55:08] <CAPSLOCKlive> THAT Painting
[1:55:08] <%UrsulaCat> minecraft a good game
[1:55:08] <+Lord0Mugen> Final Fantasy Advance is an Isekai
[1:55:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pat's isekai would be "Reincarnated as a Toilet: Mission Accomplished"
[1:55:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Lost is actually hentai. it's porn for bad plot

[1:55:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> YEAH KEEP DOING IT
[1:55:20] <EliahNebb> Futurama is an isekai

[1:55:27] <MayorRev> CRONUS!
[1:55:29] <dukenux> Narnia series is ABSOLUTELY an isekai
[1:55:31] <+ennui_on_me> @doc_ock_rokc I mean I'd say it counts myself, but it definitely has different narrative elements to that of say, KonoSuba, where the character is entirely separated from his own culture. It's maybe a subgenre more than a totally different thing
[1:55:33] <tigerfang86> YEYEYE
[1:55:33] <%GraceTBM> futurama is absolutely an isekai
[1:55:34] <Laironx3> The worst Boomer!

[1:55:36] <%UrsulaCat> kronos
[1:55:39] <$cureneckbeard> abipopSNACK
[1:55:43] <+kekkerscrew> But they're not actually In another world in SAO That would be like saying watching a Livestream is an Isekai if you can't leave your desk
[1:55:46] <%lancerous007> The Matrix is an isekai deconstructed?
[1:55:48] <worldbrand> that painting was actually untitled and the subject matter is unclear

[1:55:54] <Bigyanno> SAO is still an isekai
[1:56:06] <%wolfofsound> he's a titan
[1:56:11] <zenith0111> I just learned about it in Art History
[1:56:11] <floralkami> @wolfofsound that doesn't cover the general definition, and leaves out other shows that for the definitely while also taking others out, like Gate
[1:56:12] <VJdarkworld> army of darkness is an isekai
[1:56:15] <%maskofmichael> The Matrix is a reverse isekai
[1:56:15] <dukenux> @gracetbm "That time i fell into a frezer and woke in Y3K"
[1:56:19] <@Squdnate> is twitch chat an isekai hmmm sbfpRichard
[1:56:23] <WSintai> remember everyone, eat your babies to add time to the clock

[1:57:07] <floralkami> @maskofmichael the Matrix isnt an Isekai, it's Earth in the distant future
[1:57:13] <Bigyanno> Are you questioning why GREEK GODS do things?
[1:57:13] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus No, he does it because a prophecy says his kids will kill him so he ate them to stop it from happening
[1:57:21] <+QueequegTheater> Instead of just wrapping up

[1:57:36] <pseudo888> @floralkami the matrix is the isekai, not the movie, the matrix inside the movie

[2:20:49] <%KineKithZen> Woolie's expression says "this is also my life"
[2:20:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Horniness is a state of mind
[2:20:54] <worldbrand> its about hierarchy, not fucking
[2:20:58] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus the dog is trying to show dominance

[2:21:12] <rytisone> Woolie will remember that
[2:21:13] <+stagemage> thats why they didnt get a hamster
[2:21:17] <Milo_Oda> Boxers are amazing but I doubt they got the space for it in their apartment

[2:21:50] <%Archphronimos> so you'd have to have a well trained dog, like professionally trained
[2:21:50] <prime_name> Woolie hates animals, this is a fact.

[2:24:55] <shotgang86> WutFace
[2:24:56] <dukenux> Elmo had a bath emergency
[2:24:57] <TheArrow_> what if you got a pet human
[2:24:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> I also can't have pets in my appartment
[2:24:59] <Yukai_Yami> Elmo got poop stuck on his butt. And Elmo hates baths
[2:24:59] <%GraceTBM> just tape a knife to a roomba
[2:25:01] <TheArrow_> like from an orphanage

[2:25:17] <+MillerLowlife> what if it wasn't a pet it was just a wild animal kept inside
[2:25:18] <%madmikemonkey> @WoolieVersus Hey woolz I checked out the vertabreakers Kickstarter after listening to the podcast yesterday its been canceled and the dev posted a super sad video about their financial issues
[2:25:22] <speximillian> Agree, get a Bladewolf
[2:25:28] <TheZearGuy> The littlest hobo
[2:25:46] <$cureneckbeard> peepoops
[2:25:46] <Ion_Laser> Keaton works
[2:25:51] <hntronium> HERESY
[2:25:53] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Doesn't look the part, I agree
[2:25:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> the faaaaace
[2:25:57] <+necrocannibal2> like a bitch
[2:25:58] <dukenux> but Michael Keatons a good Batman
[2:26:00] <+sabertoothzombie> Jeremy Irons
[2:26:01] <+necrocannibal2> he looks like an old lesbian
[2:26:04] <%wolfofsound> true
[2:26:07] <+DukeBlack_> he looks nothing like Batman beyond Bruce
[2:26:16] <yuribo26> WOOLIE OLD MAN CONOSSEUR
[2:26:17] <worldbrand> get makeup to do it
[2:26:19] <%Archphronimos> Keaton is the obvious choice to me
[2:26:21] <%wolfofsound> Schwarbage
[2:26:21] <+whyskeywolfe> WE NEED %45 MORE CROTCH
[2:26:23] <shotgang86> Michael Keaton would be PERFECT
[2:26:26] <Yukai_Yami> That’s what make up is for!
[2:26:27] <+MurlinDurl> do voice overs the actors like death stranding
[2:26:29] <hussdogrob> you can pretend to be more crotchety it's ACTING
[2:26:32] <+BoboDaHobo> unpopular opinion, Batman should always be animated, live action Batman has always felt silly
[2:26:40] <dukenux> dont be, your right
[2:26:43] <Jack_of_No_Trades> What if they dub Keaton?
[2:26:46] <Sklauda1> my computer froze and had to refresh, what happened to the game?
[2:26:46] <+sabertoothzombie> @BoboDaHobo 100%
[2:26:47] <+hotleaf_juice> I’m just worried how the face on the Batman beyond suit would look in live action
[2:26:47] <Ion_Laser> We need to wait for Kevin Conroy in Crisis on Infinite Earths next month to see how Conroy would work as Live Action Bruce Wayne
[2:26:51] <UnfilteredComic> Just CGI Keatons face onto him
[2:26:54] <Doppelganger4827> have Micheal but dub Rob's voice in
[2:27:02] <@Menitta> "I always hated that Robin"
[2:27:13] <dukenux> Uh
[2:27:17] <Broand> pFPPT
[2:27:20] <Qualitybeats> Whatuo
[2:27:20] <Broand> I GOT IT
[2:27:21] <Akett> HA!
[2:27:24] <%Archphronimos> DEMIURGE
[2:27:24] <simulationbard> Ha "shocked"
[2:27:24] <Explodincatz> weak god
[2:27:26] <+MurlinDurl> Kappa
[2:27:31] <+DukeBlack_> Yaldabaoth
[2:27:33] <%Dr00_PhD> They sandbagged the hell out of that joke
[2:27:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Demiurge indeed
[2:27:44] <+necrocannibal2> god actually loses to another god in the old testament, can't remember the part though
[2:27:46] <cumurasame> we getting into gnsotic PERSONA territory
[2:27:47] <dukenux> Hes just a really strong dude
[2:27:49] <coke_monster> Converted.
[2:27:49] <KSDM> i like Old dickbag God because humans deserve an Angry God.
[2:27:51] <+BoboDaHobo> God's fucking stupid, we just have to convince him of the fact
[2:28:00] <+MurlinDurl> LUL
[2:28:01] <floralkami> Wait, WHAT?
[2:28:05] <dukenux> LUL
[2:28:18] <%Archphronimos> Yaldabaoth = Demiurge = creator god /= The real omnipotent perfect GOD
[2:28:35] <Akett> Incompetent god is the closest thing to feasable to my mind.
[2:28:41] <cumurasame> also Demiurge and GOD WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PHYSICAL BODY
[2:28:44] <Jack_of_No_Trades> God is Yogi Bear?
[2:28:44] <+whyskeywolfe> "Our God is a slow God."
[2:28:51] <%Archphronimos> The Demiurge is inherently flawed in Gnostic teachings, so that's why our physical universe is so fucking flawed and Evil exists
[2:28:57] <NaturalGear> can we Truman Show God?
[2:28:59] <+necrocannibal2> don't Jews actually dislike when you point out they weren't always monotheistic?
[2:29:01] <$cureneckbeard> It's like D&D players
[2:29:08] <%onlystrykerfan> Why is Yogi Bear
[2:29:16] <hussdogrob> if God is omnipotent he either doesn't care or is moraly bankrupt like endgame old captain america
[2:29:16] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:29:16] <+BoboDaHobo> damn, religion sure is dumb
[2:29:19] <carrotc> What the heckfrick did I just stumble into
[2:29:21] <dukenux> this is much more believable tho than the perfect benevolent god that made... this
[2:29:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yogi Bear is true divinity
[2:29:26] <Doppelganger4827> Truman Show is a Isekai
[2:29:31] <%Archphronimos> Check out Gnosticism @WoolieVersus it's fucking fascinating
[2:29:32] <$cureneckbeard> to be fair the jews did make monotheism their first commandment
[2:29:35] <+BubbaRands> So Boo Boo is Jesus?
[2:29:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> Does this mean justin temberlake is jesus for voicing Boo Boo?
[2:29:46] <ChrisM341> Seinfeld is Isekai
[2:29:48] <DonatelloJose> I love fiction
[2:30:02] <+necrocannibal2> what is this
[2:30:09] <%GraceTBM> i haven't seen it, but is the truman show some sort of isekai?
[2:30:10] <+TheotherKristian> No overwitez?
[2:30:11] <Doppelganger4827> can't stand this new world, Jerry!
[2:30:16] <bevyrage> @necrocannibal2 mystery of castle superbeast
[2:30:17] <floralkami> Hypothesis: Satan isnt real, and the adversary is God projecting his bullshit on things he doesnt like.
[2:30:21] <%Archphronimos> monotheism IS NOT the first commandment, it means have YHWH FIRST IN YOUR BELIEFS, not exclusive
[2:30:25] <TrashLeviathan> their is like a hundred different sects of judaism, ranging from practically atheism all the way to old testament god @WoolieVersus
[2:30:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @GraceTBM More of a reverse isekai, really
[2:30:33] <+necrocannibal2> @ChrisM341 she had cat ears, Jerry, CAT EARS!
[2:30:34] <ChrisM341> @doppelganger4827 XD
[2:30:38] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus That is wise. It's good to *actually* talk to multiple Jewish people on the subject.
[2:30:40] <+BubbaRands> @GraceTBM Holy shit it kinda is...
[2:30:42] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus So you walk faster in real life?

[2:31:11] <Shishi1205> @woolieversus check the camera button
[2:31:14] <dukenux> Truman Show is about a man discovering hes been put into an isrkai.
[2:31:20] <SheefEatsBeef> oh he WALKIN
[2:31:25] <Shishi1205> should be useful
[2:31:28] <ChrisM341> Should've worded that joke better

[2:34:10] <speximillian> Navigate the 3D space
[2:34:41] <+necrocannibal2> @dukenux that would require effort and creativity
[2:34:51] <Jack_of_No_Trades> that cam doesn't do a bad job
[2:34:58] <+QueequegTheater> Wow Twitter permabanned me for insulting boomers
[2:35:12] <dukenux> Rick and Morty is an isekai since that cronenberg ep

[2:35:46] <+profanityincluded> you killed that guy
[2:35:47] <$JobbedBone> Aren't most of the isekai adaptations of light novels? I think that trend is restricting the show variety at the moment
[2:35:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is a saint
[2:35:51] <%Vyneci> Played college ball you know
[2:35:52] <Ultimatefool> Twitter: Boomer Theater

[2:39:40] <+VariantX7> looks like hes powerwalking
[2:39:41] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater there is an article on this boomer who was yelling on his podcast about young people destroying generational conversation, saying "boomer" was ageism and akin to using the n-word for old people
[2:39:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> Munchmom wanted to eat you woolie
[2:39:42] <Tucker0603> woolie is scared of woods?

[2:41:53] <dukenux> Paige realised that her life is a comedy
[2:41:54] <+Skeletor725> doesn't the term boom imply weapons of mass destruction, like a bomb from ww2 perhaps? well the term boomer might of been derived from "Baby Boomer": "a person born in the years following World War II, when there was a temporary marked increase in the birth rate." - google
[2:41:58] <LandOfTheWay> ''Damn, foiled by a wooden door!"
[2:42:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> survival horror problems

[2:43:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @floralkami It's because the afterlife has squatters rights

[2:44:05] <floralkami> Everyone, come together so we can curse Woolie for another 3-4 months. He hasn't learn his lesson
[2:44:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I wonder what that WEAPON is
[2:44:05] <buckwheat70> Major increase of birthrate following the return of soldiers after WWII, a “baby boom”.
[2:44:12] <Broand> Ghosts work like that because they're associated with the area they inhabit.
[2:44:12] <+necrocannibal2> ghosts can throw shit at you

[3:06:48] <Akett> Blenderbus.
[3:06:48] <+profanityincluded> its just an old shotty
[3:06:50] <+QueequegTheater> DO NOT OVERWRITE 12
[3:06:52] <SomersaultJustice> it's the gun King K Rool uses in DKC2
[3:06:53] <Tucker0603> blunderbuss is an old ass shotgun
[3:07:02] <+stagemage> show pat new key too
[3:07:02] <+NarcissistCactus> muskets in world war 1
[3:07:09] <+ladomania> you load it with whatever the fuck you want
[3:07:11] <DedlokPM> woolieLORE
[3:07:13] <Bigyanno> A blunderbus was a gun from the era of musketballs which fired a fuckton of musket balls all at once in a person's face. It's a proto shotty
[3:07:13] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Guns back in the day that you could stuff with rocks and nails
[3:07:15] <CAPSLOCKlive> PJSalt LORE PJSalt
[3:07:18] <+Kindan55> can feel that salt musket boi
[3:07:24] <+QueequegTheater> Since save 12 you encountered one of the ending conditions
[3:07:34] <Shishi1205> we need save 12 for the progamer ending
[3:07:40] <%UrsulaCat> I'll feel ur salt musket if uh
[3:07:42] <MayorRev> K Rool is dummy thicc
[3:07:45] <+QueequegTheater> So keep it to get back to the other endings
[3:07:46] <ChrisM341> "Don't save over save 12" sounds like a horror movie title

[3:22:04] <Laironx3> 🔈 NotLikeThis
[3:22:06] <RAH001> that was years of suppressed negative feelings towards pat in that shot

[3:22:13] <%UrsulaCat> a microphone sucking its own dick
[3:22:16] <Akett> I love how there was zero reaction IRL or in-game to Woolie shooting Pat.
[3:22:27] <Jack_of_No_Trades> We all tried
[3:22:29] <+Kindan55> Shad may not be a pedo or a nazi, but he sure does cater to them.
[3:22:34] <a_mad_dragon> Woolie Vs. Woolie
[3:22:40] <hntronium> IMMORTAL
[3:22:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Pat is IMMORTAL
[3:22:47] <xeros720> woolie just underestimated his shortness
[3:22:48] <Cozy90> put dog poop on a stick and chase pat with it.
[3:22:51] <%king_wragles> Pat is incredibly stoppable
[3:22:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie: You say that
[3:22:54] <ChrisM341> Just kick him in the Colostomy Bag
[3:22:55] <GingaNZ> Pat HATESSSSS being shot
[3:22:58] <Agami23> just put your hand on his head and he cant reach you
[3:23:02] <Ultimatefool> Just throw some dirt on him, he will DIE instantly
[3:23:04] <Doppelganger4827> red bull makes him immortal
[3:23:06] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There's a tiny bug, in the lighthouse, the infinite bullets respawn
[3:23:06] <+whyskeywolfe> "A gun fired bullet"
[3:23:07] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus just get a jar of mayo, that's enough.
[3:23:08] <Arweynn> Pat has aquired immortality/invulnerability from Elmo
[3:23:08] <themagic_conch> idk gout did a number on him
[3:23:29] <%UrsulaCat> god you nerd
[3:23:34] <@Menitta> I instinctively do that

[3:27:36] <spacecatstreams> woolie smells.... good
[3:27:41] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Flip the switch
[3:27:42] <CursedNobleman> right hand rule, just use the collision on the right side of the map LUL
[3:27:45] <%KineKithZen> Perhaps you should stick to the rivers and the lakes that you used to, Woolie
[3:27:55] <MasterDecoder> Save before leaving cabim
[3:28:01] <Yukai_Yami> Maybe you shouldn’t chase those waterfalls
[3:28:02] <MasterDecoder> *cabin

[3:29:02] <wayfaringheir> If it helps, there are a LOT of monsters near it
[3:29:30] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's that centre-right forest area, there should be a couple of spiders close to it

[3:44:01] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Go to bridge, move northeast, if you pass the forest, you're too far
[3:44:03] <+QueequegTheater> @Tacthetyrant no, Panzers had good manuevering
[3:44:10] <CherrieVelvet> the camera is the true enemy
[3:44:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> Follow to the bridge

[3:44:58] <+QueequegTheater> no
[3:45:19] <wayfaringheir> Big Tree has Big Spiders guarding it
[3:45:20] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus i think the biggest tree is guarded
[3:45:23] <mrlastchance1> So is this game good?
[3:45:31] <Shishi1205> you need to spam the shovel when you get near it. also 2 spiders guard the tree you seek
[3:45:37] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus the tree will have enemies around it
[3:45:39] <+QueequegTheater> The biggest tree is like 3 times wider than other trees and has spooders
[3:45:47] <himbearbedtime> Good is subjective, but it's impressive for a 3-month fan project
[3:45:58] <mrlastchance1> That's more what I emant
[3:46:06] <himbearbedtime> then yeah it's awesome
[3:46:07] <mrlastchance1> *meant
[3:46:09] <worldbrand> convenient!
[3:46:13] <dukenux> for a fangame? yeah really is
[3:46:14] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's northeast of the bridge, it has spider guards, you need to dig
[3:46:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good buy janky. Fitting, considering the series it's inspired by

[3:46:41] <Shishi1205> look for Spoodrts

[3:48:20] <+griffball13> @iswearimjustdandy ah i thought he had it
[3:48:24] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus the falling point will be lit
[3:48:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> there it is
[3:48:26] <himbearbedtime> Waterfall is not sighted
[3:48:33] <MasterDecoder> That's the falls, it falls down
[3:48:34] <+QueequegTheater> go back to the river
[3:48:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> Well is right next to waterfall
[3:48:36] <RAH001> Born down the river in a little tent
[3:48:43] <Shishi1205> it's there
[3:48:43] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus now go northeast from here
[3:48:44] <Broand> That is a truth
[3:48:49] <Shishi1205> you hear it
[3:48:53] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Northeast of the well is a good direction to go
[3:48:53] <%TheSniperJoe> I want to see the Woolie, go into the waah-tah
[3:48:54] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus If you jump in the *river,* you wade. And you walk down the river to the waterfall.
[3:48:54] <+QueequegTheater> you are next to waterfall NOW
[3:49:02] <MasterDecoder> At waterfall
[3:49:05] <+QueequegTheater> It is right here
[3:49:18] <+QueequegTheater> yes
[3:49:27] <+QueequegTheater> big tree with spiders
[3:49:28] <Shishi1205> correctly
[3:49:30] <Broand> That well is adjacent to waterfall
[3:49:30] <+QueequegTheater> much bigger tree
[3:49:32] <Shishi1205> kolGlaiveS1 kolGlaiveS2 kolGlaiveS3
[3:49:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> Big tree with enemies
[3:49:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> Think Pixies
[3:49:47] <KaiserMario> God, Queequeg and I are trying super hard, but it's so frustrating LUL
[3:49:47] <MasterDecoder> Wrong tree
[3:49:54] <Bazmiku> the big tree is REALLY fucking big
[3:50:00] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus tree is a fullscreen sized tree
[3:50:02] <Shishi1205> bigger one
[3:50:08] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There's spiders close to it
[3:50:18] <Broand> Why don't you walk down INSIDE the river until you find the waterfall next time :V
[3:50:19] <+QueequegTheater> It is absolutely massive
[3:50:22] <wayfaringheir> The Tree has shallow hills around it
[3:50:28] <Shishi1205> you need to use the shovel not hit with it
[3:50:42] <DracaenaLeaf> The three is fat but I don't remember it filling up the screen
[3:50:48] <DracaenaLeaf> tree*
[3:50:51] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus If you cross any roads, you're too far
[3:50:59] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you have not seen it at all yet
[3:51:01] <MasterDecoder> No, you haven't seen it yet
[3:51:05] <+QueequegTheater> it will have spiders
[3:51:11] <Shishi1205> look for spiders
[3:51:24] <hntronium> I think woolie is using the shovel wrong?
[3:51:28] <Shishi1205> go further into the forest
[3:51:30] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus also, you'll need to use the shovel, not equip it
[3:51:35] <hntronium> use it from the menu
[3:51:38] <+QueequegTheater> there it is

[4:06:52] <rytisone> aiming takes forever
[4:06:52] <CherrieVelvet> shovel might be a better melee weapon than the bat
[4:06:53] <Flyrant> it's jammed
[4:06:54] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it has a huge windup animation
[4:06:55] <nichos7> Taking damage interrupts the shooting animation
[4:06:57] <laserbeaming> But God Hand had tank controls!
[4:07:08] <ShoggothLord> @cureneckbeard Superbeast, Superbeast, it's time for Castle Superbeast. Woolz likes this type of game the least, Superbeast, Superbeast.
[4:07:20] <+QueequegTheater> east from the well
[4:07:24] <NotLysander> if you follow that ledge the camera should snap to something

[4:08:21] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus the lighthouse light direction

[4:12:11] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's the dark spot on the south-east of the map
[4:12:15] <Agami23> grave is optional i think
[4:12:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> IF you hit the river follow it
[4:12:26] <Agami23> though what really is optional to a streamer?
[4:12:28] <$Louie_Salmon> If you can get to the waterfall, you're basically right there.
[4:12:46] <iswearimjustdandy> @agami23 its cool and gives the ending hes going for context
[4:12:47] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you keep turning every time there's a major camera angle shift, try to just keep going forward
[4:12:47] <rytisone> follow that amazing light that lighthouse makes Kappa
[4:12:57] <+QueequegTheater> use the tank controls to your advantage
[4:13:15] <trashcansan> hit the river, hug the ledge, and you'll be there in no time
[4:13:24] <DedlokPM> Use the boost to get through
[4:13:37] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Follow the cliff edge to the east of the waterfall and you'll hit it no problem, just stay in the grey
[4:13:37] <buckwheat70> Heat the key.
[4:13:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Try a somersault
[4:13:54] <rytisone> this game needs zapping system to play as Pat
[4:14:00] <SixthSun2> Hiver Rugging

[4:14:20] <+QueequegTheater> not yet
[4:14:23] <+QueequegTheater> but later
[4:14:23] <Man_in_the_Red> @rytisone but that would require adding a stupid zapping system

[4:16:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ah, so the shovel was the timestop we needed all along
[4:16:12] <rytisone> check behind the grave
[4:16:25] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus and look at the back of the grave stone

[4:17:21] <Starotter70> Eh, it's fine
[4:17:24] <DedlokPM> @QueequegTheater Think those are triggers for stuff tho

[4:18:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> apatBig apatHoldon
[4:18:24] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus there is but it's narrow. You have to drop from directly above it
[4:18:25] <+MinoMiushi> no just drop down from right above the cave
[4:18:27] <Starotter70> Don't worry, happened to me too
[4:18:27] <iswearimjustdandy> Directly above
[4:18:29] <Agami23> @WoolieVersus so why did you fall right beside the footing??
[4:18:32] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus When you stand in the right spot the camera changes to show the cave with you right over it.
[4:18:33] <MasterDecoder> Directly above
[4:18:35] <Masamune195> is the smol game fun
[4:18:47] <hntronium> I am enjoying Woolie's suffering
[4:18:48] <KaiserMario> LUL
[4:18:48] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus no there is
[4:18:52] <laserbeaming> you have the no fall damage plume

[4:18:53] <Broand> he mindgoblins toded
[4:18:58] <trashcansan> poor woolie lol
[4:18:59] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's ok, it was very funny
[4:19:00] <Agami23> logical is a strong word
[4:19:00] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie it's not your fault, this is very much a game for Pat
[4:19:04] <%GraceTBM> thats an empirical guess
[4:19:06] <Breakfast_Megapowers> !motivated
[4:19:06] <@Moobot> 480 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:19:08] <countgaculatv> Woolie just use your dreads to glide down
[4:19:12] <rytisone> never assume, know
[4:19:14] <Bazmiku> !uptime
[4:19:15] <hntronium> less logical and more instinctual
[4:19:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 28 minutes
[4:19:21] <NotLysander> It's a lore thing
[4:19:26] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus this is also the longest ending for sure
[4:19:43] <Dr_Mooose> calculated
[4:19:44] <+QueequegTheater> Does anyone know if the grave is a trigger?
[4:19:49] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's important that you trash your baby's grave
[4:19:50] <Doppelganger4827> and Woie cast himself from the highest...
[4:19:50] <trashcansan> idk what will kill woolie more: this game or death stranding
[4:19:53] <+QueequegTheater> bc I'm not sure
[4:19:55] <%ChansonNoire> damn I got a sub
[4:19:57] <%ChansonNoire> what the
[4:19:59] <laserbeaming> I don't think so
[4:20:01] <+MinoMiushi> the grave doesnt affectr the 3 known endings as far as I know
[4:20:03] <buckwheat70> !fence
[4:20:10] <Broand> The most amount of time in this game is taken up by wandering around blindly
[4:20:17] <trashcansan> ahhhhh noooo
[4:20:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> upi dod
[4:20:23] <hntronium> LOST

[4:20:37] <+QueequegTheater> Yes, the camera and not you veering left
[4:20:38] <wayfaringheir> Wrong way
[4:20:47] <Broand> once you know what to do then it's easy
[4:20:50] <countgaculatv> @Masamune195 He's definitely not
[4:20:50] <+cvp5127> oh no
[4:20:52] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater I might be wrong, but digging the grave disappears the statue, right? Or is that another trigger?
[4:21:01] <wayfaringheir> BACK
[4:21:05] <iswearimjustdandy> @kaisermario it does
[4:21:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> use visual landmakrs
[4:21:09] <+QueequegTheater> @KaiserMario I think so, but I doubt he wants to get the other endings
[4:21:14] <+QueequegTheater> He seems tapped out
[4:21:19] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL

[4:30:50] <Shishi1205> B is super easy
[4:30:52] <floralkami> B is real easy

[4:30:54] <trashcansan> oh god, woolie just sleep
[4:30:54] <$TyroneRugen> It was Bloodborne all along!
[4:30:56] <Masamune195> i want to play the game but i might be spooked too hard lol
[4:30:57] <Jack_of_No_Trades> You got the one Pat didnt get
[4:31:00] <hntronium> Ending C hard though
[4:31:00] <wayfaringheir> Use Root baby on Roots
[4:31:01] <rad_dude123465> get b get b get b get b get b
[4:31:01] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus give the baby to the root instead of fighting
[4:31:03] <Shishi1205> what you did but not fight
[4:31:03] <+profanityincluded> plop the fossil root on the root
[4:31:04] <Flyrant> the real castle super beast, were the friends we made along the way
[4:31:05] <Broand> You have to get to the root of the problem
[4:31:06] <Agami23> you go back to that spot and use the petrified roots
[4:31:06] <speximillian> The Baby
[4:31:06] <floralkami> go to the roots
[4:31:06] <Starotter70> Same but put Corpse on Roots
[4:31:07] <hntronium> Don't bother trying for C
[4:31:07] <Dr_Mooose> the baby
[4:31:12] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you put the root on the roots hanging from the celing in the boss arena
[4:31:16] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Go to cave with boss, ang give baby to root
[4:31:18] <+QueequegTheater> The hanging brown roots
[4:31:18] <Bazmiku> use the root baby thing on the roots in the bossroom
[4:31:21] <+MinoMiushi> C is doable if he uses save 12 its fine
[4:31:23] <+MurlinDurl> The Baby MiniK
[4:31:27] <+profanityincluded> fossil root, on ceiling root
[4:31:27] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus Ending [B] is done by putting the baby in the roots in the boss arena
[4:31:33] <hntronium> Pat had problems doing C
[4:31:34] <Starotter70> Getting there?
[4:31:41] <trashcansan> oh god, he's going to have to get back there
[4:31:43] <hntronium> Woolie ain't gonna like trying for C
[4:31:45] <+MinoMiushi> Sav e 12 is for ending C
[4:31:46] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus 12 is for C
[4:31:46] <$cureneckbeard> Ending C is tricky, Pat had to restart his run from scratch to get C
[4:31:48] <wayfaringheir> Ending C
[4:31:50] <Dr_Mooose> C is pretty crazy
[4:31:50] <+profanityincluded> ending C is a bitch, but its cool
[4:31:59] <Jack_of_No_Trades> C requires 12 I think
[4:32:03] <trashcansan> don't even try going for c lol
[4:32:04] <rad_dude123465> For C
[4:32:05] <Agami23> you need to start over and speed run to get items out of sequence
[4:32:06] <Shishi1205> C for save 12 should be good?
[4:32:07] <KaiserMario> C is really good, but kinda tricky
[4:32:10] <+QueequegTheater> You have to not pick up the stuff in the lake for C
[4:32:11] <DracaenaLeaf> we are all 12
[4:32:12] <Bazmiku> B kinda tells you.
[4:32:15] <+Matto424> B will give you a hint
[4:32:16] <laserbeaming> EndingC requires B
[4:32:18] <Broand> You'll know
[4:32:19] <worldbrand> crawl into the dark machine
[4:32:20] <+drabberfaun535> c is the cool ending
[4:32:20] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Do B first
[4:32:21] <Shion963> don't you have to Do B first?
[4:32:23] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus When you get the silver feather, jump off the castle bridgre IMMEDIATLY
[4:32:25] <%ChoculaUltra> was half expecting Matt or Pat to show up to hand Woolie a Rocket Launcher towards the end of the fight ngl
[4:32:29] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Requires the codec code from back of box
[4:32:30] <floralkami> do B first
[4:32:41] <shinichizio> catonNom
[4:32:46] <MayorRev> Wait is Ending C a speedrun?
[4:32:49] <Starotter70> Yeah, it may require a new run
[4:32:51] <Jaxnos> hot
[4:32:54] <trashcansan> he wants to be tall
[4:32:55] <+MurlinDurl> LUL
[4:32:57] <TheArrow_> Ending C is really cool though
[4:32:59] <Starotter70> Height
[4:33:00] <Shion963> C is triggered by B
[4:33:01] <juxtest> Who doesn't?
[4:33:01] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's REALITY
[4:33:02] <Kemmybelle> Watch Pats (Paiges actually) stream for ending C.
[4:33:02] <%DashXero> 'Cause you're tall.
[4:33:03] <worldbrand> It's a "nightmare"
[4:33:03] <%FenixSeraph> Pat is Wooliekin
[4:33:03] <+MinoMiushi> ENding C is a speedrun yes
[4:33:04] <Flyrant> Pat wants to be tall like woolie
[4:33:05] <Shishi1205> the thing is when you get one item you get locked out of ending C
[4:33:05] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat YEARNS
[4:33:08] <Man_in_the_Red> its a nightmare
[4:33:08] <laserbeaming> not exactly?
[4:33:09] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you're gonna want to see ending C
[4:33:09] <+FrostedZaibatsu> GET OUT ending
[4:33:09] <$cureneckbeard> Pat wishes he was as tall and cool as Woolie
[4:33:10] <+Matto424> You don't dream about being Woolie?
[4:33:10] <rad_dude123465> He wants to be tall
[4:33:12] <+MurlinDurl> or pat is dreaming he is the fixed camera watching you bumble about
[4:33:12] <Tucker0603> C requires new run after B I think?
[4:33:14] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat wants the DARKNESS
[4:33:15] <+QueequegTheater> trust me
[4:33:16] <Shishi1205> save 12 is before that
[4:33:16] <+MinoMiushi> You don't even need the gun for ending C
[4:33:17] <Shion963> finish B and then start New Game
[4:33:17] <$cureneckbeard> Better WOolie
[4:33:18] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus If you progress beyond the feather and get the ruined dagger, you hard lock into ending A/B
[4:33:23] <Kemmybelle> Pat dreams of being tall.
[4:33:23] <@Menitta> Why are you me? i'm me!
[4:33:26] <Jaxnos> woolie's dreamt of being brennan?
[4:33:28] <Ethel9727> Did dream Woolie have a higher power level than real Woolie?
[4:33:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat just wants to be tall with hair
[4:33:31] <Jack_of_No_Trades> What was dream woolie like?
[4:33:32] <trashcansan> I thought we all dreamed about being woolie
[4:33:32] <Starotter70> It's really weird
[4:33:33] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus You can get to the cool part in C but you don't have to finish it all the way if that makes sense
[4:33:35] <+QueequegTheater> You made this? I made me
[4:33:38] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus It's because you're TALL
[4:33:40] <%UrsulaCat> I have dreamt of being someone ele
[4:33:40] <Sedrelic> so.. . brennan
[4:33:42] <laserbeaming> Pat is bringing people into his Nightmare
[4:33:52] <floralkami> i have, but of Raven from Teen Titans
[4:33:58] <%FenixSeraph> I dream of Meaty White Leg Woolie
[4:34:08] <buckwheat70> Lol @sedrelic
[4:34:09] <trashcansan> remember to hug the ledge
[4:34:20] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus You need to play a new save up until you get the feather, jump off the castle bridge and get a new item from that location that this current save has been locked out of and play from there
[4:34:30] <MayorRev> okay so for real how cool is ending C
[4:34:38] <MayorRev> does a cool guy show up
[4:34:40] <Shishi1205> very cool
[4:34:40] <Agami23> ending C is super cool
[4:34:40] <+MinoMiushi> Not neccesarily
[4:34:40] <hntronium> did it
[4:34:43] <Bazmiku> How far is his save 12?
[4:34:44] <laserbeaming> kinda cool?
[4:34:45] <+MinoMiushi> Save 12 is before the golden dagger
[4:34:48] <+MinoMiushi> Is it not?
[4:34:54] <Shishi1205> save 12 should be good for C?
[4:34:55] <+QueequegTheater> it is
[4:34:57] <Dr_Mooose> he did a lot for 3 months of work
[4:34:57] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @mayorrev Cis FUCKING COOL
[4:35:00] <+profanityincluded> C is pretty short if you know what do
[4:35:02] <+QueequegTheater> Save 12 is good for C
[4:35:02] <MayorRev> hmmmmmm!
[4:35:06] <Starotter70> Yeah, it's pretty damn impressive
[4:35:07] <Agami23> @Kuro_Koshka yeah but you need to have completed B first i believe
[4:35:13] <Flyrant> chop suey
[4:35:15] <+whyskeywolfe> Perhaps you were under the impression they fucked around in Sweden?
[4:35:20] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus It MIGHT work as long as the save is immediately after getting the feather
[4:35:22] <shinichizio> I like the alarm clock version
[4:35:24] <+QueequegTheater> DEVIL JIN

[4:39:52] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus right as you're coming out of the castle
[4:40:05] <+QueequegTheater> and also to the right
[4:40:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just do it perfect with no deaths
[4:40:15] <DracaenaLeaf> there is no right, only left and wrong
[4:40:16] <Ultimatefool> Don't mess with gravity Woolie
[4:40:21] <MasterDecoder> To Castle
[4:40:21] <+MinoMiushi> Just go to the castle and save
[4:40:21] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I think you also need to jump down the waterfall for C
[4:40:24] <Starotter70> Just go back
[4:40:25] <+profanityincluded> is 12 good enough tho?
[4:40:26] <+MinoMiushi> And then jump off the bridge
[4:40:30] <Starotter70> I think
[4:40:30] <floralkami> just go back
[4:40:32] <Shion963> start a new game and speedrun the torch
[4:40:33] <MasterDecoder> Check inventory
[4:40:33] <Bazmiku> Go to the castle. save there.
[4:40:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> If you have feather, jump off bridge
[4:40:37] <Shishi1205> jump off
[4:40:37] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Starboard right after you leave the castle
[4:40:40] <laserbeaming> now go and jump off that bridge
[4:40:40] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Do NOT pick up the stuff in the lake
[4:40:42] <TheArrow_> make sure you have feather
[4:40:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> he has the feather
[4:40:51] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Make new save before jumping just in case
[4:40:53] <Zalthia> !uptime
[4:40:54] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 50 minutes
[4:41:08] <+MinoMiushi> Save before jumping off
[4:41:14] <Shion963> Start a new game, the. speedrun to torch and feather
[4:41:25] <Agami23> not speed running. sequence breaking
[4:41:27] <floralkami> save just before
[4:41:31] <+QueequegTheater> It's only 12:21 on a saturday night
[4:41:32] <+gustavozxd> late PM
[4:41:42] <+griffball13> just in case
[4:41:47] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus also jump down waterfall
[4:41:48] <+profanityincluded> its fine
[4:41:52] <floralkami> just in case
[4:41:53] <Broand> oh you'll need the gun
[4:41:56] <+Matto424> you'll be fine
[4:41:57] <Broand> for ending c
[4:42:01] <MasterDecoder> @WoolieVersus You guys are safe from the Jumpscare btw
[4:42:02] <Kemmybelle> If it doesn't work & you don't want to play anymore, you could always watch Paige's stream later.
[4:42:03] <+MinoMiushi> It gives you the gun its fine
[4:42:04] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus ya don't need to pick up the gun
[4:42:07] <Broand> oh
[4:42:07] <worldbrand> you dont need the gun
[4:42:10] <laserbeaming> you don't need the gun
[4:42:14] <Broand> Right my bad
[4:42:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> ITs...not wrong
[4:42:23] <+TopTieramisu> how did they capture woolie so well?
[4:42:34] <Flyrant> they mocapped woolie
[4:42:45] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's a really cool ending, so it's worth it, but it's not that long that'll want to do it later... so...
[4:42:52] <+MinoMiushi> theres only so many bridges to jump off of though
[4:43:04] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Meant to stretch your dollar back in the day, make you explore every inch
[4:43:07] <hntronium> What?
[4:43:12] <Star_Duck> if you are falling too fast, you can always try to shoot and kill the ground before it hits you
[4:43:13] <hntronium> Braid?
[4:43:15] <wirblewomble> you can see where you're supposed to jump off from a camera angle on top of the castle, so it's not totALLY random
[4:43:23] <+griffball13> DIVORCE
[4:43:39] <rytisone> Woolie is raising another flag
[4:43:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:43:42] <+QueequegTheater> Alright so 21 is safe
[4:43:51] <ZComiX> joe far is he?
[4:43:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> its about 4 hours
[4:43:53] <hntronium> 12 and 21 are safe
[4:43:55] <+QueequegTheater> now right

[4:44:03] <+MinoMiushi> Woolie bridge entracne right side
[4:44:05] <ZComiX> ok
[4:44:07] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it's right next to the wall
[4:44:09] <Shishi1205> entrance
[4:44:18] <cumurasame> so in case woolie reads this - I'd like to share one of my teaching moments from here in Japan. I was teaching the kids directions so the game was "turn right, go straight, turn left etc etc stop." So for one particular class, the first time I said STOP. One of the kids decides to be a genius and yelled "ZA WARUDO!" Everyone was about to fall over laughing.
[4:44:18] <+QueequegTheater> jump forward
[4:44:26] <+QueequegTheater> yeyeyeye
[4:44:31] <valriot> "Patience" isn't it like 4 hours?
[4:44:36] <rytisone> no fall damage here
[4:44:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @rytisone Of course because we have a magic feather
[4:45:00] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater Oh yeah, going into the waterfall, tells you about this, I think
[4:45:11] <+QueequegTheater> no gun LUL
[4:45:12] <ManOfReason> That’s a good one too
[4:45:16] <+griffball13> just run past
[4:45:16] <hntronium> DUST IN THE MACHINE
[4:45:17] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[4:45:21] <+QueequegTheater> Equip the shovel
[4:45:22] <DSD24> @cumurasame Did you then say "Time has become to move again?"
[4:45:22] <+profanityincluded> run bro
[4:45:23] <Shion963> no gun is fine
[4:45:31] <@Menitta> Didn't people get really mad when Sonic Mania didn;t have achievements
[4:45:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No gun run
[4:45:37] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:45:37] <+Dhamilt> Did the jumpscare happen yet?
[4:45:40] <cumurasame> @DSD24 was way too focused on not falling over
[4:45:46] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Get key and save
[4:45:48] <MasterDecoder> @Dhamilt Yes and no
[4:45:49] <wayfaringheir> Dagger?
[4:45:51] <Tucker0603> items

[4:46:12] <Shion963> closet
[4:46:12] <+profanityincluded> youd need to start over
[4:46:14] <Personified134> @WoolieVersus you need to go to save 12, the point of the checkpoint is that it lets you come to this room before you normally could
[4:46:15] <+QueequegTheater> Wait what?
[4:46:19] <Shion963> told ya new game
[4:46:23] <laserbeaming> oh the dagger is not here

[4:46:39] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus There is supposed to be a unbroken dagger on the desk
[4:46:40] <Broand> Daggers on the chair tho?
[4:46:40] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Sorry Woolz we forgot
[4:46:43] <+griffball13> it's fine
[4:46:45] <Starotter70> Ah well
[4:46:46] <TheArrow_> boooo
[4:46:54] <rytisone> but ending C is the coolest
[4:46:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alas, it happens
[4:46:59] <hntronium> Feel free to watch pat's playthrough of ending C
[4:47:00] <floralkami> booo
[4:47:02] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus before the podcast you need to make sure to watch ending C on Pat's VOD
[4:47:05] <+paladinstarbuster> pat did it pretty fast
[4:47:06] <Shishi1205> you need to get an item b4 an action happens
[4:47:06] <$cureneckbeard> C is hard
[4:47:07] <%notcbo> it was a hell of a run still
[4:47:08] <MayorRev> too extra
[4:47:12] <Jack_of_No_Trades> That is fine man, the thing at the end is awesome but a pain
[4:47:14] <hntronium> Watch Woolie for A and B, Pat for B and C
[4:47:15] <Bazmiku> C has a NG+ thingy involving the monster. She doesn't show up if I remember correctly?
[4:47:16] <+paladinstarbuster> its not that long
[4:47:21] <hntronium> Perfect
[4:47:24] <Shishi1205> pat needed like 7 minutes to get it
[4:47:27] <+MinoMiushi> Paiges VoD
[4:47:31] <Broand> The monster won't show up in future runs
[4:47:31] <+QueequegTheater> It's fucking WILD
[4:47:32] <+MinoMiushi> Remember it was on her stream
[4:47:33] <worldbrand> halloween
[4:47:34] <Personified134> @WoolieVersus they played it on halloween
[4:47:34] <%notcbo> last weekend i think
[4:47:34] <Exiliator> C is crazy
[4:47:36] <Shion963> it's a short run to start C
[4:47:36] <Starotter70> Last Thursday?
[4:47:36] <hntronium> Halloween stream
[4:47:37] <MasterDecoder> @WoolieVersus Paige's VOD
[4:47:38] <CherrieVelvet> i don't think save 12 was bad, you probably have to start a new save to do it
[4:47:41] <Kemmybelle> It'll be on Paiges VoD though.
[4:47:43] <Shishi1205> they played Halloween night
[4:47:44] <Agami23> they played it day of release
[4:47:47] <worldbrand> oh gorsh
[4:47:48] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's on PeachSaliva's channel
[4:47:49] <Shiranui24> c is the true ending i think
[4:47:50] <wayfaringheir> Halloween, five minutes from midnight
[4:47:50] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus it was on Paige's stream
[4:47:52] <rytisone> Lets go
[4:47:52] <laserbeaming> They played the 31 when it was released
[4:47:54] <hntronium> It was in the room with the light key
[4:47:55] <floralkami> its on Paiges stream
[4:48:00] <hntronium> I think
[4:48:02] <+Bane_Kaikyo> NOT PAT'S vod it was PAIGES HALLOWEEN VOD
[4:48:02] <+Steamed_Hagao> waterfall
[4:48:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you go out get key from forest, get key for 2nd floor, then feather
[4:48:06] <Malikwest11> it was in the blue fire room
[4:48:11] <%Wool> can't they just watch Pat's vod right now on stream
[4:48:11] <Bazmiku> Oh shit. is Woolz a madman?
[4:48:14] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat had to contact dev for walkthrough to get it done
[4:48:15] <Shishi1205> it's worth just so you see the end result
[4:48:16] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus room with the blue flame and the lighthouse key I think
[4:48:17] <Dr_Mooose> it can be done quickly, but that is with knowing where to go
[4:48:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus you go out get key from forest, get key for 2nd floor, then feather
[4:48:26] <JetpackMcQuack> Woolies second wind
[4:48:30] <alapazam> has woolie played this before? just got in
[4:48:36] <+profanityincluded> forest key, 1st floor key, 2nd floor key, feather
[4:48:39] <cumurasame> Woolie 2ND GIG
[4:48:42] <+gustavozxd> "I mean look"
[4:48:46] <Broand> WORLDS FIRST
[4:48:48] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus @PeachSaliva Halloween VOD
[4:48:50] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus If you look for the VOD, it was Paige's Halloween stream
[4:48:50] <Starotter70> Eyepatch Wolf has some experience
[4:48:51] <Bazmiku> Victory lap lets go
[4:48:52] <FstSergeant8595> Woolie make sure you level strength because it scales in this game. There is no soft cap.
[4:48:54] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie used Mean Look!
[4:48:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> WR pace, baby
[4:48:58] <Breakfast_Megapowers> You barely get to play a video game with a black protagonist at all
[4:48:59] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @rad_dude123465
[4:48:59] <Shion963> the Dev help was that the game didn't make you start a new game, and allowed you to continue with a "finished" he state. Ending C required a new world state
[4:49:01] <Shishi1205> forest key then fire poke then second floor
[4:49:02] <+QueequegTheater> Steph can no longer switch out!
[4:49:13] <CherrieVelvet> @woolieversus you get the key from the forest, then the key from the toilet, then the feather to jump off the bridge
[4:49:23] <ZComiX> `did he get b?
[4:49:24] <hntronium> DANCE PUPPETS
[4:49:31] <shinichizio> [B]lanishment was got
[4:49:34] <+paladinstarbuster> YES
[4:49:34] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you will be given the gun eventually
[4:49:35] <Shishi1205> get some bullets
[4:49:35] <ZComiX> ok
[4:49:37] <+profanityincluded> please do pick up some bullets tho
[4:49:37] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus no weapons is no problem for ending c
[4:49:38] <Personified134> I think you do need the gun yeah
[4:49:40] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus wou will need bullets
[4:49:40] <$SilverRoddo> Hallowoolieen is still alive.
[4:49:41] <MasterDecoder> @ZComiX Yea, A and B, going for C
[4:49:42] <+QueequegTheater> You need some bullets
[4:49:44] <+profanityincluded> like 20ish
[4:49:44] <Broand> you need bullets
[4:49:45] <+MinoMiushi> You don't need the gun
[4:49:46] <+whyskeywolfe> Mock The Deadly Enemy
[4:49:47] <+paladinstarbuster> GET THOSE
[4:49:48] <+Matto424> You just need bullets
[4:49:48] <Broand> and thats it
[4:49:53] <nichos7> You do not need the gun, but you do need bullets
[4:49:55] <shinichizio> Poor Dark Souls enemy, can't jump :<
[4:49:56] <Bazmiku> Gun and Bullets very need
[4:49:56] <+MinoMiushi> It give you 20 bullets too
[4:50:03] <+drabberfaun535> you get the gun in the final part of c
[4:50:03] <+MinoMiushi> it gives you gun and 20 bullets
[4:50:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chat appears to be split upon the matter of gun
[4:50:11] <+profanityincluded> its fine its fine
[4:50:14] <+QueequegTheater> GUN is divisive
[4:50:15] <hntronium> More bullets is nice
[4:50:15] <laserbeaming> I think you only need the Bat, The Camera and the feather
[4:50:16] <Flyrant> has woolie talked on stream at all about GG2020?
[4:50:21] <Shion963> gun is fine with or without
[4:50:25] <+MinoMiushi> Its like you didnt even watch the VoD
[4:50:25] <Broand> if it gives bullets then it's whatever
[4:50:31] <+MinoMiushi> You don't need the gun
[4:50:32] <Shishi1205> gun is good
[4:50:33] <+griffball13> you get all you need in the final part of c
[4:50:37] <+paladinstarbuster> Nah
[4:50:37] <hntronium> Just one fight
[4:50:37] <Bazmiku> I'm not sure what game does about GUN
[4:50:38] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it's not that long
[4:50:38] <ZComiX> C is super short
[4:50:42] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Very long to beat
[4:50:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:50:45] <ZComiX> No you dont need the gun
[4:50:45] <Shishi1205> to get to it yeah
[4:50:48] <%Wool> Can't they just watch Pat's vod or a video of Ending C
[4:50:50] <NemokillerV> oh yeah, I forgot that it gives you gun.
[4:50:51] <+profanityincluded> more like an actual bossfight, A was pathetic
[4:50:52] <floralkami> !MOTIVATED
[4:50:52] <+MinoMiushi> Chats drinking dumb bitch juice
[4:50:52] <@Moobot> 482 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:50:54] <Exiliator> You get all you need
[4:50:56] <Shishi1205> to beat it it's another thing
[4:50:59] <Bazmiku> Does C just give you the GUN?
[4:51:01] <Kemmybelle> Getting to C can be short, beating C could take a bit.
[4:51:01] <laserbeaming> The bossfight will take you a while
[4:51:03] <+RichardMF_> 7 mins to get to, the boss will take a little more @woolieversus
[4:51:04] <Shion963> yep
[4:51:05] <+Tonku_the_Red> Just got here. Who is that with Woolie?
[4:51:05] <prime_name> Don't forget Mindjack @WoolieVersus
[4:51:06] <ZComiX> gives gun
[4:51:08] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus you don't need to pick up the gun but grabbing a few extra bullets could help
[4:51:10] <+MinoMiushi> Pat did it on Paiges stream you absolutely do not need the gun
[4:51:11] <+QueequegTheater> @Kuro_Koshka how dare you say such completely justified things
[4:51:11] <Agami23> you dont need to get the gun. it will be given to you
[4:51:11] <DracaenaLeaf> Didn't it take pat awahile for ending C?
[4:51:11] <hntronium> If they watch the vod it'll be like a 4 person lp all over again
[4:51:20] <+Bane_Kaikyo> I thought C gave an infinite gun?
[4:51:22] <Shion963> get to C or complete C
[4:51:23] <@Menitta> Mario Sunshine speedrun
[4:51:28] <+griffball13> MINDJACK was a great stream
[4:51:29] <@Menitta> Those are rad
[4:51:32] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Considering that chat knew how to do it, it took much less time than Pat & Paige
[4:51:32] <+QueequegTheater> @DracaenaLeaf we just need to get Woolie to the boss, he'll mark out
[4:51:38] <+gustavozxd> what about that guy that was gonna speedrun omikron or something

[4:53:37] <Jack_of_No_Trades> OR HAVE YOU? u havent
[4:53:38] <Agami23> either you missed it or you haven't gotten to it

[4:53:41] <Starotter70> Ziplining
[4:53:42] <@Menitta> Maybe the 1 jump scare was just a trick into making you think there was one
[4:53:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL too personal?

[4:58:22] <%Kiiper> It helps a lot
[4:58:22] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I dont know if it gives it to you, but Pat used it
[4:58:26] <Graxe_> Doesn't all the camera do is let you reset the camera angle?
[4:58:26] <ZComiX> everything will be given to you in time
[4:58:29] <hntronium> TWO GUYS
[4:58:30] <Broand> So how do you do the final boss then? you need to change perspectives all the time
[4:58:30] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus listen to KaiserMario

[4:58:31] <laserbeaming> is the boss beatable without the camera?
[4:58:32] <TheArrow_> how else will you take creepy ghost selfies?
[4:58:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus Camera is just to readjust the camera in the forest world
[4:58:58] <CherrieVelvet> doesn't the camera work in the boss fight tho?
[4:58:59] <%Kiiper> Yeah, not sure how you do the boss without the camera

[5:06:16] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus Heres what you do. You run around a column to break eye-contact. You sneak around and use GUN while it can't see you. Once it falls, run up and stab it twice before running.
[5:06:20] <ZComiX> Remember Camera
[5:06:22] <+Urgotfantasy> Immersive voice acting, its like woolie's really there
[5:06:22] <+profanityincluded> oh boy

[5:06:36] <kunaiiiz> LUL LUL
[5:06:37] <Flyrant> bodied
[5:06:38] <SaltyAzteca> What is this Killer 7 boss LUL
[5:06:38] <%GraceTBM> check chat for good strategy
[5:06:39] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus This boss is hard, sneak, shoot when when it cant see you, then stab
[5:06:41] <+QueequegTheater> Also go get the fucking camera
[5:06:42] <GoYaK> LUL
[5:06:45] <Shishi1205> okay when it spins don't shoot
[5:06:47] <%Kiiper> I was half wrong
[5:06:48] <CAPSLOCKlive> so THAT's what he was messin with
[5:06:49] <hntronium> @WoolieVersus Get out of his line of sight
[5:06:51] <rytisone> Pat was a silent hill boss all along
[5:06:52] <+paladinstarbuster> Hide in shadow
[5:06:53] <+RichardMF_> @woolieversus hide in shadows then shoot when it's not spinning
[5:06:54] <$SilverRoddo> M O R T I S
[5:06:54] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Camera would help ALOT
[5:06:55] <+MinoMiushi> @WoolieVersus use the lifep otion
[5:06:55] <Obake_Radio> o.o oddly reminds me of Petscop.
[5:06:58] <+MinoMiushi> TOp off
[5:07:00] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus Spinning means shield. When he can't see you spin stops.
[5:07:00] <GoYaK> Dave was right
[5:07:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dont say that Steph
[5:07:01] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus Heres what you do. You run around a column to break eye-contact. You sneak around and use GUN while it can't see you. Once it falls, run up and stab it twice before running.
[5:07:01] <+profanityincluded> except we were totally wrong and you should go get the camera LUL
[5:07:03] <Bazmiku> Ok. Camera might be required.
[5:07:04] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Go. Get. The. Camera
[5:07:05] <%Kiiper> It gives you camera chat
[5:07:09] <Shion963> gotta juke the eye and then shoot it when I can't see you
[5:07:12] <hntronium> SE[C]RET BOSS
[5:07:16] <Shion963> this is a GAME
[5:07:20] <cumurasame> it adds camera to inventory guys
[5:07:22] <+paladinstarbuster> GET THE CAMERA
[5:07:24] <Shion963> yeah
[5:07:24] <GoYaK> this is a JAME

[5:07:25] <+Tonku_the_Red> Who is this with Woolie?
[5:07:25] <%Chichen> IN THREE MONTHS
[5:07:29] <+Guardsman_Neckbeard> Look at chat. Do these look like faces that would lie to you? No, not that face, look at that other face.

[5:07:33] <+paladinstarbuster> EQUIP IT
[5:07:37] <laserbeaming> chat is never wrong, except when it is
[5:07:38] <+QueequegTheater> mash time
[5:07:40] <+profanityincluded> this cinematography tho
[5:07:40] <Shishi1205> you might want to top off your full health
[5:07:41] <ZComiX> Remerai said if you guys didn't allow him to use your liekness he would have just swap the character models
[5:07:51] <Broand> Look at the camera in his inventory when he equips the gun
[5:07:58] <%Chichen> "HOW DARE YOU"
[5:07:58] <CherrieVelvet> camera came with the gun
[5:08:05] <+QueequegTheater> use camera
[5:08:07] <Jack_of_No_Trades> It is really impressive
[5:08:09] <Shion963> juke it
[5:08:20] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you have the camera now
[5:08:21] <ZComiX> Good Luck
[5:08:21] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Nah, you need to get the Camera, its IMPORTANT
[5:08:26] <+MurlinDurl> gotta be a way to shoot it safely
[5:08:27] <floralkami> camera came with gun
[5:08:29] <Broand> He has the camera
[5:08:32] <Broand> it was a freebie
[5:08:37] <+Tonku_the_Red> Hey chat, who is the lady on the couch?
[5:08:39] <+profanityincluded> wait does woolie not have shadows rendering?
[5:08:39] <%Kiiper> @Breakfast_Megapowers He has camera, it gives it to you
[5:08:41] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus Stay out of sight!
[5:08:50] <laserbeaming> so... are the shadows on low or something?
[5:08:51] <Bazmiku> Use your camera
[5:08:53] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus shot when it ain't spinning, then shank that bitch
[5:08:53] <Shishi1205> shoot him then knife him
[5:08:54] <Shion963> k now ambush it and shoot
[5:08:56] <+profanityincluded> oh no
[5:08:58] <Jack_of_No_Trades> gotta be close, shoot in the back, then stab
[5:08:58] <$SilverRoddo> Mi boosu.
[5:08:58] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus shoot him from behind when he's not spinning
[5:08:59] <+paladinstarbuster> gotta be close
[5:09:00] <bevyrage> spam that camera button
[5:09:00] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus the GUN has a really short range
[5:09:04] <Shishi1205> you have the camera button btw
[5:09:04] <+MinoMiushi> @WoolieVersus THe gun range is very small
[5:09:05] <Breakfast_Megapowers> @Kiiper But he needs to EARN it
[5:09:05] <ZComiX> is the lighting bugged?
[5:09:08] <floralkami> @woolieversus the red bars tell you where it is looking
[5:09:09] <+QueequegTheater> USE CAMERA
[5:09:10] <hntronium> Why does it look like the shadows are fucked up
[5:09:11] <%Kiiper> :/
[5:09:12] <+QueequegTheater> YOU HAVE IT
[5:09:16] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus You have the camera as a freebie
[5:09:18] <%GraceTBM> you can use a single pillar to hide from it by running around it
[5:09:24] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Shoot it when it loses you, Stab with knife 2-3 times, run away, repeat
[5:09:24] <Dr_Mooose> yeah, there should be shadows
[5:09:29] <SaltyAzteca> yyuuuuse it
[5:09:35] <worldbrand> hup
[5:09:36] <Shishi1205> crazy talk

[5:09:50] <Broand> STAB
[5:09:52] <+MinoMiushi> You gotta stab it npw
[5:09:54] <hntronium> STAB WITH DAGGER
[5:09:54] <wayfaringheir> KNIFE
[5:09:54] <+profanityincluded> @WoolieVersus Your shadow settings are low, making this fight harder
[5:10:00] <Bazmiku> STAB
[5:10:01] <bevyrage> rinse and repeat
[5:10:01] <Shishi1205> shank that bitch when it's on the ground
[5:10:04] <arkv01> call it by its true name to weaken it... "Eli"
[5:10:05] <floralkami> @woolieversus the red shading shows where it is looking
[5:10:05] <+QueequegTheater> You hit him a bit
[5:10:08] <KaiserMario> WHIFF
[5:10:11] <$SilverRoddo> Gravity Falls?
[5:10:13] <laserbeaming> is the lighting bugged or is it on low?
[5:10:14] <Jack_of_No_Trades> he has a hit react
[5:10:14] <wayfaringheir> You have time for two stabs
[5:10:21] <Shishi1205> camera woolie
[5:10:22] <hntronium> Lighting is super fucked I think
[5:10:35] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Use the moves to win
[5:10:38] <Bazmiku> Lighting is beyond fucked
[5:10:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Quit it eye demon
[5:10:42] <+Tonku_the_Red> @woolieversus Who is the lady with you tonight?
[5:10:46] <blue2red> blood ocean
[5:10:46] <+Stratiotai2> what is this game?
[5:10:49] <ZComiX> FUCK HIM UUP
[5:10:50] <+MurlinDurl> PogChamp
[5:10:52] <Shishi1205> shank that Bi
[5:10:57] <+QueequegTheater> heal
[5:11:00] <+MurlinDurl> oh fuck run
[5:11:02] <DedlokPM> 3 stab rooPog
[5:11:04] <wayfaringheir> TWO stabs
[5:11:08] <Starotter70> Yeah, he attacks on wake up
[5:11:10] <shinichizio> Merh!
[5:11:12] <+profanityincluded> 2 stabs is safe
[5:11:17] <+QueequegTheater> I think it has like 10ish health right?
[5:11:19] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus Given that you stuggle with the controls still, I think nobody really expects you to be able to beat this boss.... like, pat had trouble and he LOVES tank controls and survival horror...... I can't really speak for chat, but I think maybe it was enough to simply make it here and see the secret boss pop off
[5:11:21] <arkv01> oh no!
[5:11:27] <SaltyAzteca> Thats it for your health bro, now it is time to succeed!
[5:11:27] <floralkami> the thing DPs on wakeup
[5:11:33] <hntronium> Is Woolie gonna beat the boss in less tries than pat?
[5:11:37] <Jack_of_No_Trades> bad lighting bug is making eyes vision cone not clear
[5:11:42] <ZComiX> Hey Woolie, What does the Boss Remind you of?
[5:11:43] <nichos7> @WoolieVersus The level's lighting fucked
[5:11:49] <+whyskeywolfe> *beh*
[5:11:57] <Shion963> the lighting is important to the puzzle
[5:11:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:11:59] <KaliasTV> I assume this is a unity game and it defaulted to the low graphics preset?
[5:12:00] <arkv01> yeah its the colors are freaky but this makes it really hard to see the eye
[5:12:04] <Shion963> shank him
[5:12:07] <Shishi1205> knife 2 times
[5:12:09] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Stabby Mc Stabb
[5:12:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> survival horror tech
[5:12:14] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Good luck man, took Pat about 4-5 tries
[5:12:15] <+QueequegTheater> two more I think
[5:12:17] <+MurlinDurl> ur close
[5:12:19] <ZComiX> You got about 12 more hits to do
[5:12:21] <+QueequegTheater> use camera way more often
[5:12:25] <Shishi1205> or knife him from the furthest distance
[5:12:26] <Dr_Mooose> this is really good for a second attempt
[5:12:26] <laserbeaming> it might have defaulted to low shadows
[5:12:27] <Bazmiku> Woolie is doing a lot better than he reasonably should be. Lighting and Camera are both kinda fucky.
[5:12:37] <%Kiiper> two more and I don't think he grab healing in the kitchen
[5:12:42] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus so it's doable but tough
[5:12:44] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Boss health is the number of pillars
[5:12:46] <%Theplahunter> Theplahunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Lets go! 2 months and hopefully many more. I've been following you and the guys for years... And now i can start giving back with money.
[5:12:46] <+MurlinDurl> NotLikeThis almost had him
[5:12:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dunno what u messin wit
[5:12:49] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you should heal and get the spare bottle on the counter
[5:12:53] <+QueequegTheater> Also the lighting is completely bugged out
[5:12:53] <Jack_of_No_Trades> if he beats this with bugged lighting, it is more impressive then when Pat beat that invisible bloodborne boss
[5:12:56] <%Kiiper> @WoolieVersus There's healing in the kitchen
[5:12:57] <+ladomania> woolie your shadows are fucked
[5:12:59] <Shishi1205> top off before the encounter
[5:13:00] <hntronium> You should also go into the match with full health
[5:13:02] <+ladomania> its making it harder lmao
[5:13:05] <+DigbyMayor> @woolieversus You did better than pat did
[5:13:05] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus heal now
[5:13:07] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Use your EVO "Going Pro" training
[5:13:09] <Kemmybelle> It's okay Woolie, it took Pat a few tries too.
[5:13:09] <+RichardMF_> @woolieversus the lightning is very messed up than what its supposed to look like
[5:13:10] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus in addition to the controlls, the camera and the lighting seem broken
[5:13:11] <arkv01> Mista, shoot us better!
[5:13:13] <Shishi1205> get that bitch to full life
[5:13:16] <ZComiX> 12 hits
[5:13:23] <+griffball13> 12 dagger hits
[5:13:23] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus heal now and grab the bottle in the kitchen
[5:13:25] <ZComiX> i THINK
[5:13:27] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Pillars are boss health
[5:13:33] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you can NOT get 4 in each time
[5:13:39] <%Wonderbot3000> Wonderbot3000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[5:13:43] <Tisaric> oh that's nice
[5:13:44] <+QueequegTheater> get two
[5:13:47] <Bazmiku> Woolie might actually beat the boss in less attempts.
[5:13:48] <Breakfast_Megapowers> 4 is not doable
[5:13:51] <+profanityincluded> 2 each time is safe
[5:13:52] <Breakfast_Megapowers> do 2 or 3
[5:13:54] <wayfaringheir> @WoolieVersus I highly sugguest you go with two stabs each round. You can do three if you are close at the start. Any more and you get hit
[5:13:56] <+QueequegTheater> We watched Pat bumble this
[5:13:57] <Dr_Mooose> 4 is a super risking move
[5:14:01] <ZComiX> Pat's Stream was 8 hours long. 2 were on the boss
[5:14:01] <+griffball13> 3 is opptimal but 2 is safe
[5:14:03] <Shishi1205> 3 is with risk
[5:14:04] <Dr_Mooose> *risky
[5:14:05] <+ladomania> pat took a long time to do it
[5:14:06] <+QueequegTheater> use camera more
[5:14:07] <+ladomania> that's why
[5:14:12] <SparkAfterDark> Woolie learning in real time how survival horror bosses are solved games
[5:14:14] <laserbeaming> try quitting the game and check if the lighting quality is on low? @woolieversus
[5:14:15] <+RichardMF_> 2 is safe 3 if you shoot him up close
[5:14:25] <Breakfast_Megapowers> do 1 swing each just to be a baller
[5:14:30] <Jack_of_No_Trades> fast spinning is projectile incoming
[5:14:44] <$TyroneRugen> Lightning seems busted
[5:14:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Looks like a samurai jack episode
[5:14:50] <+QueequegTheater> it is
[5:15:06] <SparkAfterDark> actually yeah the light is so fucked up you're at a massive disadvantage right now. And it doesn't look as cool.
[5:15:06] <NeroInfinite> It was made in like 3months so yeah
[5:15:12] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Gotta get back to the past Woolie Madden!
[5:15:15] <+oknani> not in a game section?
[5:15:18] <ZComiX> Woolie the boss is easier if you can fix the lighting bc it shoes where he is looking and what State he is in
[5:15:28] <Dr_Mooose> Samurai Woolie
[5:15:35] <Bazmiku> Lighting was fine on Peach's vod.
[5:15:38] <+QueequegTheater> 3 stabs
[5:15:41] <%UrsulaCat> ow my tongue is burnt
[5:15:47] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie is a Ninja though, BELIEVE IT
[5:15:48] <Dr_Mooose> nice

[5:16:07] <Broand> Capitalized
[5:16:08] <+QueequegTheater> why always me
[5:16:12] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater You had it coming
[5:16:13] <wayfaringheir> Pat never got four in one go
[5:16:13] <cumurasame> woolie showing the animation cancel into super

[5:16:22] <+QueequegTheater> :(
[5:16:22] <worldbrand> watch out for shredder
[5:16:25] <BestTeaMaker> whiff'd
[5:16:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You know what you did Queequeg
[5:16:31] <ZComiX> I mso happy you chose to give this game a shot. I spent all halloween watching ti with Pat and Peach
[5:16:33] <hntronium> thrown under the bus by both pat and woolie
[5:16:34] <neraren> Is this the CSB game mentioned in the podcast?
[5:16:38] <Broand> Oh yeah it's also the eyeball from pat's channel
[5:16:44] <+QueequegTheater> @neraren yes
[5:16:52] <Bazmiku> They thought this was a Survival Horror, but it was actually a Fighting Game.
[5:16:57] <+MurlinDurl> when you keep wiffing your gun parry in bloodborne :(
[5:16:58] <+QueequegTheater> use the camera button often
[5:17:10] <arkv01> pat is the final eivl
[5:17:16] <worldbrand> royal guard
[5:17:21] <+QueequegTheater> 3 this time
[5:17:24] <Dr_Mooose> ^
[5:17:25] <Broand> do a YRC gunshot into C.S
[5:17:30] <SparkAfterDark> If he loses this time he's GOTTA reset to fix the lighting. missing out on the shadows is both a handicap and a bummer because visually this part is rad as shit
[5:17:32] <+QueequegTheater> 6 HP
[5:17:41] <juicysal> Try turning off the flashlight before giving Pat the dagger next time, it might be fucking with the lighting?
[5:17:43] <+ladomania> how is woolie doing better than pat with this bugged lighting and tank controls handicap
[5:17:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> survival horror item switching LUL
[5:17:49] <TigerClaws12> gunshot YRC knife

[5:28:22] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus Congrats on beating the game! So for reference, the real jumpscare was at the bottom of the waterfall on Ending C specifically
[5:28:22] <xeros720> the arms flailing about being "combat" is so Alone in the Dark it hurts

[5:29:08] <floralkami> DeadlyP stream coming soon
[5:29:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus Now that youre here, if you have any free time to spare read/watch Golden Kamuy. Its a super cool manga about a hunt for gold with criminals and military dudes.
[5:29:16] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There's a theory, that Pat was the King and you were the Alchemist... get it? Because Chemicals
[5:29:17] <+scizor285> why does Woolie look like a football player?
[5:29:18] <Flarepulse> Sound and Fury*
[5:29:26] <Agami23> from what i heard the anime is shit but the manga is good
[5:29:29] <Dr_Mooose> watch Vinland Saga
[5:29:33] <hntronium> anime is fine
[5:29:33] <NeroInfinite> niceu
[5:29:38] <%notcbo> THORFINNNN
[5:29:42] <Breakfast_Megapowers> What? I never got a gifted sub? RIGGED
[5:29:43] <Superblooms> awww i was too late for gifts
[5:29:46] <+DigbyMayor> How nice
[5:29:49] <+Kage_96> Dude the anime is legit imo
[5:30:01] <+Kage_96> but never read the manga
[5:30:05] <+QueequegTheater> YOU DEFEATED
[5:30:06] <xeros720> you killed the pat
[5:30:25] <+QueequegTheater> they also don't exist
[5:30:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they can touch you!
[5:30:31] <Agami23> i saw some comparisons and i think people were upset with the anime because it went more realistic at times. where as the manga has alot more focus on style
[5:30:32] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah, my first message was like half an hour after the start
[5:30:34] <xeros720> ghosts are just the Death Stranding
[5:30:40] <Jack_of_No_Trades> poultrygeist
[5:30:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE REMEMBER OMIKRON
[5:30:52] <Agami23> what about a ghost shark? @WoolieVersus
[5:30:54] <xeros720> so they can't interact with the world, but they can interact with you real good
[5:30:56] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Ghost can rape you 24/7 and you'll never know
[5:30:56] <Laironx3> Only fear the super boss ghost
[5:30:59] <Breakfast_Megapowers> What if the water becomes haunted?
[5:31:00] <Starotter70> They could knock that glass onto your head
[5:31:04] <KaliasTV> Every liquid you try to drink is knocked over, forever
[5:31:04] <+Nomicro4u> what if they give you a ghost blowjob like in ghost busters?
[5:31:04] <dots4eyes> Reminds me of the ghost, werewolves, vampires podcast...
[5:31:06] <+whyskeywolfe> wAIT WHAT
[5:31:10] <wayfaringheir> Isn't the fear of ghosts is that when a ghost strangles you, it strangles your SOUL?
[5:31:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If ghosts can interact with the the world, then they can be punched in the face. Ain't no reason to be scared of ghosts
[5:31:11] <%GraceTBM> what about if it just knocked over every single glass you ever fill in your apartment
[5:31:17] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus what if a ghost is up your urethra RIGHT NOW
[5:31:17] <TheArrow_> woolie's already survived one curse
[5:31:20] <%UrsulaCat> water knocked over onto my laptop
[5:31:22] <xeros720> peeing the pool of blood might be all the monster energy though
[5:31:23] <Agami23> @WoolieVersus what about a ghost that makes you feel like you are constantly playing omicron the nomad soul?
[5:31:24] <rytisone> what if they show your nudes online

[5:32:39] <Tacthetyrant > True stand power!
[5:32:42] <arkv01> glub glub glub thanks for the mosnter!
[5:32:42] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Part of the fear of ghosts, is that you could end up becoming one, trapped forever in a limbo of pain

[5:32:52] <%UrsulaCat> jjba except your stand hates you
[5:32:57] <+DigbyMayor> Woolie enslaves his ghost fiancé
[5:32:58] <%GraceTBM> wouldn't it be the sickest deal if you got a stand but then you had to be someone else's stand after you die
[5:33:07] <floralkami> @ursulacat so Cheap Trick
[5:33:11] <%Vyneci> She'd become Crazy Talk, she would do anything in her power to make sure everything you say doesn't happen or the reverse happens LUL
[5:33:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:33:12] <arkv01> bind your stand with the ring!
[5:33:21] <wayfaringheir> Gouf Custom for life

[5:33:54] <MaxwellKraft> isn't it the f71 g cannon?
[5:33:55] <xeros720> after playing battle operation 2 for a while, i got a lot more respect for Cannon type units
[5:33:57] <Broand> I like grimoires :V
[5:33:57] <+DarkLinkBJ> "Nice"
[5:33:59] <speximillian> Huh, he likes a grunt.

[5:34:17] <NeroInfinite> F71 G Cannon is ooo
[5:34:18] <maguado87> Wait GM suits is your favorite?
[5:34:18] <MaxwellKraft> mobile suits with cannons are bad ass
[5:34:19] <arkv01> its okay I guess but I think you're gonna want an armored core
[5:34:27] <Jack_of_No_Trades> it is cool
[5:34:31] <rytisone> Punch mom: "Men and their toys"
[5:34:32] <maguado87> Wasn't he a Zeke lover?
[5:34:40] <CopperTucker> Nice
[5:34:44] <%Wool> Punch mom is now Munch mom because of this stream
[5:34:45] <NeroInfinite> I want an armored Core
[5:34:50] <Breakfast_Megapowers> If it doesn't have the Gundam Mark it's EXTINCT
[5:34:55] <%chronoxgp> too bad gundam games are terrible
[5:34:57] <speximillian> I super would have imagined him liking a punchbot like the AGE Titus or Shining

[5:35:38] <speximillian> Wait Brock is a Smackdown and Dio's on Raw, which show do I need to watch to see that
[5:35:48] <Bazmiku> it's so surreal that this is live. Streaming is weird.
[5:35:52] <+talfurt> cant believe brennan got brock smashed on tv
[5:35:53] <+griffball13> he kept dying like a bitch
[5:35:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pats not good at the videogames

[5:35:59] <wayfaringheir> He was at it for over an hour
[5:35:59] <rad_dude123465> @maguado87 is that not what he’s wearing?
[5:36:00] <+whyskeywolfe> Literally took him 10 tries.
[5:36:06] <Jack_of_No_Trades> you just did better in every way in harder circumstances
[5:36:11] <Agami23> pat had to ask the creator for help @WoolieVersus
[5:36:11] <speximillian> @chronoxgp You want Titanfall 2
[5:36:22] <xeros720> pat got hit with a progress blocker too, it lengthened the stream time quite a bit
[5:36:24] <+Nobara> Took more then one stab per shot
[5:36:26] <floralkami> true...
[5:36:26] <%chronoxgp> kinda but more destruction lasers, space
[5:36:33] <CherrieVelvet> @WoolieVersus that was pretty much it
[5:36:40] <+MinoMiushi> Only because you need NG+ for ending C
[5:36:44] <+MinoMiushi> It doesnt convey that well
