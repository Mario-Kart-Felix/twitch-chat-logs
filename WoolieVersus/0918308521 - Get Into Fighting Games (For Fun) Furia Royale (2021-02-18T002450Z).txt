[0:03:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this week in fighting games
[0:03:56] <DaKnightWarrior> I like that.
[0:04:01] <BlackermanZX> leo may have lost his rekka but got a dirty command grab
[0:04:03] <+Dova573> VSHIFT THAT META
[0:04:09] <@Menitta> SFV looks fucking amazing
[0:04:11] <big_booty_animemilf> SF5 LUL
[0:04:12] <@Menitta> That update
[0:04:13] <Solidnick18> sf5 is getting good i think
[0:04:15] <+Dova573> Fuck yo blockstrings
[0:04:17] <Xeno351> ono getting kicked saved SF
[0:04:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> REGGIE we gotta play again
[0:04:22] <%ChoculaUltra> that v-shift animation alone sold me back on SFV LUL
[0:04:24] <KaiGoesMoo> V-shift's animation alone looks sooo goooooood
[0:04:25] <Zeppelee> Ram has been retooled, too.
[0:04:26] <JOJOHNNY135> SFV is finally looking fun
[0:04:28] <+Dova573> FUCK YO TAKE DA TRHOW
[0:04:36] <Applecannon63> V shift should have a shadow counter
[0:04:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> BUFF ABIGAIL
[0:04:43] <@Solidus_113> Juri got a huge buff with this patch, so I'm happy
[0:04:44] <theugliestguitar> gonna finally pull the trigger on buying SFV
[0:05:02] <fxcknips> woolieONEGUY
[0:05:02] <@Menitta> I feel stuff like Ryu's parry V Trigger 2 is not gonna be as useful
[0:05:04] <Zeppelee> My girl Rose is back!
[0:05:12] <Applecannon63> V shift>CA2
[0:05:21] <+Dova573> bait it or counter vshift
[0:05:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigail gonna have some problems and some new gross ass setups
[0:05:30] <%ChoculaUltra> word, they're definitely going to have to retune some of the v-trigs, namely the parry/focus attack esque ones
[0:05:32] <RichochetForce> V Shift > V from the Devil May Cry series
[0:05:59] <TigerClaws12> better parry
[0:06:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19

[0:06:15] <DingusMcBaseball> oh shit, Mugen PogChamp
[0:06:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigail 2 hit back heavy now even more unsafe
[0:06:25] <Applecannon63> I'm scared if when they bring Akira Kazama and she adds another mechanic to the v-shift
[0:06:28] <TanyaSaberFace> has woolie said anything about his hope for baiken in strive?
[0:06:46] <Applecannon63> MIND GAMES
[0:06:51] <RichochetForce> Baiken will be in Strive... as DLC
[0:06:54] <theugliestguitar> Bayonetta Everywhere System
[0:07:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's gonna be some gross ass shit with this so i'm super happy and excited
[0:07:04] <RichochetForce> ArcSys made a ton of money from her DLC sales
[0:07:04] <TanyaSaberFace> isnt there still 1 slot?
[0:07:12] <BlackermanZX> you can counter with your own v shift too
[0:07:15] <Applecannon63> WITCH TIME + VISION = UI
[0:07:28] <AllenDeadman> depth
[0:07:30] <@Solidus_113> Grapplers in absolute shambles

[0:07:50] <%WeSkrong0329> WeSkrong0329 subscribed with Prime.
[0:07:57] <+Checktrap> Capcom doesnt want OSs in SFV
[0:08:04] <Applecannon63> Grapplers will take advantage of the v-shift bait
[0:08:08] <%patriotrenegade> @woolieversus So next week is Demon’s Souls on Tuesday and Thursday?
[0:08:10] <+Checktrap> so if thats the case theyll remove it
[0:08:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> i hope it's not an annoying input
[0:08:19] <TanyaSaberFace> has woolie done a room tour? i wanna see his merch
[0:08:30] <RichochetForce> Diagonal on controller? Oof
[0:08:33] <@Solidus_113> He has, unofficially
[0:08:47] <%ChoculaUltra> he kinda did one for Mario Kart LUL
[0:08:47] <TanyaSaberFace> where?
[0:08:53] <Zeppelee> You need a stick for diagonal.
[0:08:58] <RichochetForce> Yeah
[0:08:59] <Applecannon63> cause you can whiff V-shift breaks right?
[0:09:05] <@Menitta> It could be whatever the character
[0:09:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @TanyaSaberFace kinda, you can watch his rc mario kart video from a couple months back
[0:09:13] <RichochetForce> In almost every game I've tried controllers simply do not handle diagonals well or reliably
[0:09:13] <stabbityrabbit> Did I miss Woolie talking about Strive craziness?
[0:09:16] <@Menitta> Whatever the character's opposite V Reversal is
[0:09:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:09:22] <TigerClaws12> maybe three kicks
[0:09:24] <%dedeec> dedeec subscribed with Prime.
[0:09:33] <+Checktrap> cant 3 kicks because of Ed
[0:09:41] <DaCheekyOne> Roman cancel
[0:09:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigial literally has run on 3 kicks
[0:09:55] <Applecannon63> would it be RC input?
[0:09:56] <Zeppelee> That sounds like a RC.
[0:10:01] <+Dova573> maybe backdash with vtrigger button?
[0:10:02] <@Solidus_113> Maybe it could be back and 2 buttons
[0:10:05] <@Menitta> They already do have V Reversal on 3 punches or kicks
[0:10:17] <+TheCityBeast> G's charge up is a down down
[0:10:17] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, Dan is looking kinda nuts because of how many options he has
[0:10:25] <%ChoculaUltra> but again - its Dan
[0:10:27] <+Sajallday> I think zeku has down down for his transformation
[0:10:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> v reversal sucks
[0:10:37] <JOJOHNNY135> Zeku’s transformation is a down down
[0:10:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> check it, it's gonna be R3 and L3
[0:10:39] <@Menitta> True only on blockstun
[0:10:39] <TigerClaws12> Dan's just a SNK character
[0:10:45] <+BarbosaEdit> i think it would be a reversed v reversal
[0:10:47] <Applecannon63> Dan the true Akuma
[0:10:57] <RichochetForce> Yeah, they're leaning into him being a goofy Ryo + the Mr. Karate mask
[0:11:09] <%ChoculaUltra> that Mr. Karate Tengu Mask has made the meme come full circle
[0:11:09] <%ggbhtg> @TigerClaws12 Always Has Been sajamShoot
[0:11:11] <@Menitta> But wouldnt V Shift and V Reversal be the same cost
[0:11:31] <@Menitta> And you still can use V Shift on blockstun
[0:11:33] <TigerClaws12> @ggbhtg even more real now with garou feints LUL
[0:11:38] <Applecannon63> Wait I forgot Rose is straight up Akuma+Yun
[0:11:58] <Applecannon63> she has a air fire ball and Gen 'eijin
[0:12:10] <+Dova573> Urien doing Aegis sets ups, VSHIFT AWAY
[0:12:57] <@Menitta> It could just replace V Reversal
[0:13:00] <DingusMcBaseball> another thing for Alex to be shit at
[0:13:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:13:06] <Applecannon63> Rose buff and debuff moves is gonna be great
[0:13:06] <@Menitta> Oh no wait nvm
[0:13:41] <%jinking79> necalli has a Normal V Trigger now
[0:13:42] <RichochetForce> Rose Rose Rose!
[0:13:47] <%ggbhtg> Liser Liser herself
[0:13:48] <DaKnightWarrior> Rose looks fun!
[0:13:50] <+Checktrap> MTL dudes and Rose
[0:13:52] <%ChoculaUltra> here I was thinking they'd just be adding the new characters and calling it a day but hot damn this is a lot of work on SFV
[0:14:16] <%ChoculaUltra> makes ya wonder how far/long an SFVI will be
[0:14:17] <Applecannon63> Rose Air Fireball and Gen'eijin
[0:14:22] <DingusMcBaseball> LUL
[0:14:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> her overall model looks really nice, it feels like sfv has stepped up the model quality from vanilla
[0:14:24] <TigerClaws12> ESports says no
[0:14:25] <%ggbhtg> Yes.....how.....unfortunate.... Kappa
[0:14:29] <RichochetForce> @ChoculaUltra I wouldn't be surprised of SFVI is 2023
[0:14:29] <Naleb> in the past 7month ive took a break from fg to play gran turismo, but in 2 week, ill V Shift back to the source
[0:14:29] <generalve> the subreddit have become massive amounts of "BACK TO HORNY JAIL *BONK* these past 3 months
[0:14:32] <@Menitta> This update is the "The life of this game is over. Time to make it fun."
[0:14:37] <DeathByPoke7> she has the teleport v trigger now for that
[0:14:55] <RichochetForce> They're making sure SF as a brand does peter out waiting for VI
[0:15:00] <@Menitta> Diepod said that and it looks like it lol
[0:15:00] <RichochetForce> doesn't*
[0:15:07] <SouthPawPad> if yo u can space the teleport to be ambiguous it will work the same way
[0:15:15] <%ggbhtg> DORAW
[0:15:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> buffs and debuffs
[0:15:16] <Applecannon63> Rose's gen'eijin is gonna trounce Chun-li's
[0:15:17] <%ggbhtg> MONSTAA CARDO
[0:15:21] <stabbityrabbit> I choose to believe that after Ono left Capcom the Street Fighter team put fun in the game just to spite him.
[0:15:22] <@Menitta> BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON
[0:15:23] <%SableS139a> DORAH
[0:15:23] <+TheCityBeast> I love FF14 Astrologian
[0:15:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> and then fucking genai jin.
[0:15:27] <%SableS139a> MONSTAH CARDO
[0:15:30] <DingusMcBaseball> DORO
[0:15:41] <+Dova573> Inb4 she has ZA WARUDO Card and stops time
[0:15:45] <@Solidus_113> They just said buff and debuff
[0:15:53] <RichochetForce> @stabbityrabbit The news that came out from Capcom was that Ono was chucked after trying to do dumb shit with 6. So that likely pushed back SF6 as they fixed it.
[0:15:58] <Naleb> Rose is more «install based » than what they promised Hawkeye was in marvel...
[0:16:02] <+ghostfaceninja_> jacket coming off
[0:16:07] <Applecannon63> Inb4 Rose gets Za Warudo Critical Art
[0:16:07] <RichochetForce> Ono seems to have been a source of bad ideas in gneral
[0:16:41] <Applecannon63> Oh god what if Rose gets Axl Time Stop
[0:16:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> it is
[0:16:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> nope
[0:16:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's a v-skill
[0:16:49] <DingusMcBaseball> its v-skill
[0:16:55] <DatAsuna> good i'm not too late
[0:16:56] <stabbityrabbit> @RichochetForce I know that the actual reason it's being worked, but I prefer my way of looking at the changes.
[0:17:00] <RichochetForce> @Applecannon63 Rose will get Nagoriyuki's full screen scarf
[0:17:08] <%ChoculaUltra> oh yeah - they confirmed Eleven isn't the last character after Akira. Any guesses?
[0:17:18] <DingusMcBaseball> get both balls out
[0:17:32] <TanyaSaberFace> @choculaultra yeah isnt he just a bonus
[0:17:41] <Applecannon63> honestly glad Eleven not a true character
[0:17:43] <RichochetForce> He's a Mokujin/Sword Master
[0:17:52] <RichochetForce> Far lower cost to implement than a unique character
[0:17:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> she has fucking genei jin and is gonna be top tier guaranteed.
[0:18:02] <%paladinstarbuster> Sean
[0:18:03] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, p sure he's a mirror character (and also there to round out the character select screen)
[0:18:07] <Applecannon63> cause Twelve his predecessor sucks ass
[0:18:17] <DaKnightWarrior> lytJACKPOT
[0:18:18] <%ChoculaUltra> Sean would be wild.
[0:18:19] <%ggbhtg> Shamwow Helm Breaker LUL
[0:18:27] <@Menitta> Also Eleven
[0:18:32] <RichochetForce> The final character of the season sure as hell won't be Sean lol
[0:18:36] <@Solidus_113> Eleven is now Mokujin
[0:18:48] <RichochetForce> It needs to be someone with value for people looking to buy the pass or individual character
[0:18:53] <+loukemia83> Bring back Dudley
[0:18:55] <@Menitta> I'm so salty that of all the fucking 3rd Strike characters to pick from, they pick Twelve
[0:18:58] <MidnightDeacon> v shift is gonna make everything so much more fun now. It really changes like everything
[0:19:03] <Applecannon63> KOF CHARACTER FOR SFV
[0:19:07] <@Solidus_113> Dan's so REAL
[0:19:09] <DingusMcBaseball> they wouldnt be making the last char such a big deal if it wasnt a big guest character like Rugal or something
[0:19:14] <TanyaSaberFace> goku for sfv
[0:19:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm very interested on what they're gonna do with oro since he did have an easy unblockable setup
[0:19:24] <Applecannon63> Dan is a real boy
[0:19:26] <stabbityrabbit> Dan's real if you believe in him.
[0:19:27] <gunstars20> Dan is REAL Let's go
[0:19:27] <%ChoculaUltra> maybe Gouken as the last character? FeelsOkayMan
[0:19:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> and those fucking rocks are back
[0:19:40] <DaKnightWarrior> I just want Makoto but i don't see it happening.
[0:19:42] <Darkmega97> Dan believes in you if you believe in him
[0:19:44] <RichochetForce> @DingusMcBaseball Exactly. This is, potentially the final character added to SFV. It has to be a big sendoff. It won't be junk like Sean or Dudley. They need people talking and buying.
[0:19:48] <%SableS139a> Dan's legit like he was in the first to Alpha games and I'm fucking stoked.
[0:19:56] <%SableS139a> Dude just looks straight fun.
[0:20:01] <Applecannon63> Dan gets cool buff special moves
[0:20:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> dan has a fucking akuma v-trigger install for his fireballs and dp
[0:20:18] <KeiganOfAstora> Are we taking bets?
[0:20:22] <BlackermanZX> give us Makoto dammit doodRage
[0:20:37] <TigerClaws12> 1 combo and he gets it
[0:20:37] <%paladinstarbuster> Ok damage
[0:20:45] <Toottootpants> I think it's more of a garou mark of the wolves reference
[0:20:54] <KeiganOfAstora> hey chat, do I still earn channel points if I don't have chat open?
[0:20:55] <willmari02> did the stream just start?
[0:21:02] <stabbityrabbit> @RichochetForce Honestly as crazy as Max's specific predictions can be, I wouldn't be surprised if the final character was a crossover character. It seems like a good send-off to a game.
[0:21:18] <Applecannon63> Kyo for SFV
[0:21:36] <Applecannon63> cause he'd fit
[0:21:40] <TopTierHarley> online random select
[0:21:41] <RichochetForce> @stabbityrabbit Exactly. It's a major thing that SF, which traditionally doesn't do 3rd part crossovers, to have one.
[0:21:42] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:21:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:21:45] <SomersaultJustice> you'll get athena and like it
[0:21:46] <TopTierHarley> he's not Mokujin really
[0:21:47] <RichochetForce> The real question is WHO
[0:21:53] <TopTierHarley> he doesn't change per round
[0:21:57] <%ggbhtg> Mokujin, except he doesn't change between rounds
[0:21:59] <Visored34> nah Kyo is boring, Terry will fit better
[0:22:02] <TanyaSaberFace> eleven sounds nutty
[0:22:06] <+b_aleph> Hello Woolie from WoolieVS
[0:22:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> anybody member Charade?
[0:22:13] <+b_aleph> Hello Reggie from WoolieVS
[0:22:16] <DingusMcBaseball> maybe it does, we dont know
[0:22:20] <%SableS139a> I was hoping that Eleven was going to be a unique character or a composite fighter, but I guess this works too.
[0:22:21] <+b_aleph> Hello Universe from WoolieVS
[0:22:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> imagine the flex that would be choosing eleven in finals
[0:22:23] <%ZweihanderSteve> or charade from soulcalibur 2
[0:22:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> thank GOD he's not the final character
[0:22:28] <Applecannon63> why Terry the pervert?
[0:22:30] <%paladinstarbuster> terry got smash give my boy lui son repect
[0:22:30] <%ggbhtg> It's still more random because raw random would let you choose V Skill / Trigger
[0:22:31] <@Menitta> Oh thats not just a new character
[0:22:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> ORO ROCKS confirmed
[0:22:33] <@Menitta> Ah ok
[0:22:33] <+b_aleph> Is WoolieVS trademarked?
[0:22:38] <TopTierHarley> yes
[0:22:40] <TanyaSaberFace> wouldnt eleven be an element of rng?
[0:22:40] <+loukemia83> SF4 and SFV are both before 3
[0:22:44] <TopTierHarley> 11 can only xcopy
[0:22:50] <Applecannon63> Rip Oro's dick
[0:22:50] <TigerClaws12> twelve just looks cursed
[0:22:51] <%CalderGaming> ludonarrative dissonance Kappa
[0:22:52] <TopTierHarley> 12 has his own moveset
[0:22:57] <+TenguGemini> I really hope SF6 takes place after 3
[0:22:59] <DDDorsett> Guesss that Deconfirms Sean based on lore?
[0:23:00] <%SableS139a> Eleven looks cooler tbh
[0:23:02] <Applecannon63> Oro lost his dick
[0:23:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but 12 can turn into third strike chun-li so fuck it
[0:23:03] <BlackermanZX> Twelve is Eleven but more miserable
[0:23:08] <stabbityrabbit> @RichochetForce The only other think they could do as a big send-off is a cross over to a dead franchise that Capcom owns. Like Asura's Wrath or Darkstalkers. But those somehow seem less likely than 3rd party.
[0:23:23] <@Menitta> please....makoto or dudley
[0:23:26] <Applecannon63> Twelve's tools sucks
[0:23:26] <Rojahh> Negan

[0:23:38] <+BarbosaEdit> @BlackermanZX holy fuck, that is MOTHERFUCKING miserable
[0:23:39] <+b_aleph> So was Necro created after or before Eleven?
[0:23:39] <Applecannon63> Kyo Kusanagi~
[0:23:45] <%SableS139a> @dundunsun kek
[0:23:48] <randominternetsurfer> ROCK HOWARD
[0:23:48] <OzdotTV> I sure hope it's a guest character
[0:23:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> oro has turtle, he best shoto
[0:23:49] <%ggbhtg> Even the leaks didn't seem to have the 5th fighter, thank gawd
[0:23:49] <pixel_river> i want to see oro the most
[0:23:55] <badjab326> Eleven should change characters every round
[0:24:01] <+BarbosaEdit> NAH, ASH CRIMSON FOR SFV
[0:24:04] <Applecannon63> seriously rip Oro's balls
[0:24:08] <joshua_42> @b_aleph well Necro has SFV art so I’d assume so
[0:24:10] <TanyaSaberFace> nago is tall af
[0:24:19] <+b_aleph> DUCK KING FOR SFV
[0:24:20] <TigerClaws12> install into losing 80% hp LUL
[0:24:20] <%ggbhtg> @Applecannon63 no manscaped ads for you
[0:24:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is woolie touhou player?
[0:24:23] <BlackermanZX> Kazuya from SfxT comeback for SFV doodNuts
[0:24:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NAgoriyuki seems to fight two opponents - the opponent and the bar
[0:24:27] <%CalderGaming> Nagoriyuki: sacrifice your life for less time on the clock Kappa
[0:24:27] <AllenDeadman> I still haven't figured out how his blood meter works
[0:24:31] <DDDorsett> As if Ash Crimson is ever coming back chat LUL
[0:24:33] <+b_aleph> Birdie vs Duck King, make it happen
[0:24:35] <+ghostfaceninja_> but his sword is BIG
[0:24:35] <repththemant> Inb4 SonicFox mains Eleven
[0:24:42] <BlackermanZX> also Nago is looking goddamn beastly
[0:24:43] <DDDorsett> Ash wrote himself out if existence
[0:24:45] <ainda_> like what if ABA got good normals outside transformation AND got her transformation
[0:24:48] <dizimous> That health drain is INSANE
[0:24:50] <randominternetsurfer> What about Giovanni, Woolie? @woolieversus
[0:24:50] <Garrett1405> !uptime
[0:24:51] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 36 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:24:53] <AllenDeadman> you DON'T want it to fill up
[0:24:56] <blue6sub6remnant6> Woolie wants to play Fritz, as expected.
[0:24:59] <AllenDeadman> completelly
[0:25:03] <crimsonsaens> You mean the second character ArcSys has made for you?
[0:25:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> beef
[0:25:05] <Applecannon63> Nago is THE RISK REWARD
[0:25:07] <+BarbosaEdit> @DDDorsett thats the joke
[0:25:08] <RichochetForce> Nago's drain is terrifying
[0:25:10] <+loukemia83> Bigs Bois Makin Noize
[0:25:12] <%LionheartedRebel> @blue6sub6remnant6 heyo friendo
[0:25:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> he was described by the game as the ONE SHOT character
[0:25:14] <stabbityrabbit> Nago is a peaks-and-valleys character. When he's doing good he's got suffocating pressure, but he has huge weaknesses.
[0:25:15] <+ghostfaceninja_> so a Samsho character
[0:25:18] <TigerClaws12> command dash
[0:25:21] <DaKnightWarrior> My kind of character.
[0:25:23] <%ggbhtg> Let Nago do cool stuff in promo footage, fuckers!
[0:25:34] <%SableS139a> @ggbhtg Eh, nah
[0:25:44] <KaiGoesMoo> Nago reminds me of Hakumen
[0:25:49] <Applecannon63> The STRIDER SWEEP
[0:25:55] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:26:07] <Applecannon63> Nago is both Hakumen/ Susanoo
[0:26:22] <@Solidus_113> Nago is reverse Sin
[0:26:28] <+Dova573> Fuck it mask off
[0:26:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> r/Kappa told me to not listen to Baiken Players
[0:26:46] <AllenDeadman> Blood Rage
[0:26:57] <Solidnick18> that step kick is sick
[0:27:00] <%AnotherF_ckFace> So is this like Vergil's Concentration Meter a la DMC4SE?????
[0:27:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "he needs it" but unironically
[0:27:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:27:05] <+Dova573> The way he puts the mask on reminds me of bleach is dope
[0:27:08] <blue6sub6remnant6> @LionheartedRebel I didn't notice right away. Ahoy-hoy. Practicing +R on my switch right now.
[0:27:11] <Applecannon63> that Wearing Mask then continues combo
[0:27:15] <DDDorsett> A.B.A moment
[0:27:19] <AllenDeadman> his HP starts to go down
[0:27:19] <TanyaSaberFace> thats some anime shit
[0:27:25] <Solidnick18> screw it
[0:27:25] <%ggbhtg> PRE SHOW
[0:27:25] <TigerClaws12> in the clip he starts with 90% and ends at 20%
[0:27:30] <%ggbhtg> PRE-SHOW
[0:27:30] <Applecannon63> SADIRA
[0:27:33] <+loukemia83> PULL IT UP COWARD
[0:27:36] <BlackermanZX> hell check the video LUL
[0:27:40] <stanlychicken> HP equivalent exchange
[0:27:44] <%LionheartedRebel> @LionheartedRebel Noice. I'm working on a couple writing things before probably getting back into more Hades runs.
[0:27:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Succan
[0:27:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:27:49] <Solidnick18> okay lol
[0:27:50] <Applecannon63> Nago is Sadira
[0:27:50] <%ggbhtg> PRE SHOW woolieGLORY
[0:28:04] <%X2Eliah> It would literally take less time to pull up the video, that to do this long-ass explanation
[0:28:10] <TigerClaws12> anxiety meter goes up
[0:28:11] <KaiGoesMoo> Full pre-show stream let's go
[0:28:26] <RichochetForce> Nago would give Pat a fucking heart attack
[0:28:26] <crimsonsaens> He means only during the blood rage
[0:28:27] <%Mrbaconator> he puts the mask on MID COMBO
[0:28:29] <%Mrbaconator> it's SO COOL
[0:28:30] <TigerClaws12> mask on mid combo is the coolest shit
[0:28:31] <MutedMimic> Mid combo Kreygasm
[0:28:32] <stabbityrabbit> It also looks like Nago can't block during rage. So he becomes the most glass of cannons.
[0:28:37] <Dr_Servbot> all I'm hearing is aba from gg
[0:28:38] <Applecannon63> Mask on mid combo
[0:29:03] <pixel_river> so you protect him till the pop
[0:29:26] <Solidnick18> i'mma watch it again
[0:29:33] <%ggbhtg> Go1 didn't get to do cool stuff during those sets, and that "high level" footage from last week didn't show much either.....LET HIM DO COOL SHIT DANG IT
[0:29:33] <TigerClaws12> he's TOO sick
[0:29:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> A good player doesn't need to think to play like an idiot.
[0:29:38] <AllenDeadman> will souls tuck to the wall
[0:29:42] <AllenDeadman> with*
[0:29:44] <%SableS139a> Fucking nutty
[0:29:44] <BlackermanZX> thats sick af
[0:29:54] <@Solidus_113> That Sol vs Nago match is a perfect encapsulation of what Strive is going to be to play
[0:29:54] <DaKnightWarrior> Strive is so crazy.
[0:29:55] <%AnotherF_ckFace> CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:29:59] <+ghostfaceninja_> @sonofthedeepsouth, unga bunga baby
[0:30:06] <cybercitizen381> so fucking hype for strive
[0:30:14] <%Mrbaconator> ye but then axl just stops time Kappa
[0:30:21] <Applecannon63> Leo is going to be nuts
[0:30:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NAgoriyuki is A.B.A.
[0:30:28] <TanyaSaberFace> aaaaaaanime
[0:30:28] <+Sajallday> he's playing samsho in guilty gear
[0:30:35] <TigerClaws12> half screen 5K LUL
[0:30:49] <pixel_river> he may be a cool comeback characater to watch
[0:30:51] <Applecannon63> and apparently Ramethal got it rough
[0:31:17] <gunstars20> and got 6H'd
[0:31:27] <%ggbhtg> Vertigo monkaS Kappa
[0:31:28] <RichochetForce> Ram is super simple now
[0:31:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> What is this Patience you talking about
[0:31:48] <DingusMcBaseball> speaking of half life woolie, whens 2
[0:31:53] <Zeppelee> Do WHAT off of Sol?
[0:32:16] <Applecannon63> I just hope Ram at least get some unique ability later in the final game
[0:32:20] <%ggbhtg> Count Zero
[0:32:31] <Applecannon63> *final build
[0:32:36] <%LionheartedRebel> I'd be VERY surprised if he's not on magic pixel after all that
[0:32:37] <DaCheekyOne> Bro, that name tho
[0:32:39] <RichochetForce> @Applecannon63 Don't get your hopes up
[0:32:40] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:32:43] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:32:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:32:48] <stabbityrabbit> I believe Go1 said you don't die from it, but your health still evaporates and you can't block.
[0:32:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> This is the Woolie curse
[0:32:53] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:32:57] <pixel_river> its defibately weird sto see how many moves got removed from ram
[0:32:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Aesthetics Players Lul
[0:33:00] <%Mrbaconator> YET
[0:33:01] <+ghostfaceninja_> Woolie, you got Darlie...
[0:33:04] <%nintega010> You got big buttons
[0:33:06] <%ggbhtg> Now let's talk about the entire Leo guide that came out 3 hours ago Kappa
[0:33:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Baiken Players LUL
[0:33:08] <+TenguGemini> where does he rank compared to setsuna in terms of cool?
[0:33:13] <Zeppelee> Nago is just Gear!Woolie.
[0:33:18] <randominternetsurfer> @woolieversus Giovanni though?
[0:33:20] <gunstars20> ALL IN
[0:33:21] <nekomajins> damn i miss my girl
[0:33:25] <aka_Jigawatt> its literately you
[0:33:27] <Applecannon63> I mean we got to see Axl's guidline that didn't have his timestop
[0:33:33] <%jinking79> this is the Vergil debuff u asked for
[0:33:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> Do not shake their hands kids
[0:34:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Do nottalk to them
[0:34:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[0:34:11] <Applecannon63> so maybe Ramethal gets some wild moves they're hiding
[0:34:22] <+ghostfaceninja_> doodBait
[0:34:22] <gunstars20> Crank that Risc
[0:34:23] <TigerClaws12> S H O C K S T A T E
[0:34:29] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Applecannon63 I hope so.
[0:34:30] <DeathByPoke7> combo of DP Kreygasm
[0:34:30] <Zeppelee> Vergil is to Woolie as Gordon Freeman is to me.
[0:35:08] <AllenDeadman> it also doesn't appear to go away
[0:35:20] <Applecannon63> I'm still thinking Ky coul've got some of his son's moves
[0:35:35] <DaCheekyOne> I figured woolie would be interested in Giovanna
[0:35:43] <crimsonsaens> Does it look like Ky's DI guts his tension gain?
[0:35:58] <+Chili_Daddy> doesn't he charge stun edge a lot faster
[0:36:12] <+Bailey__gaming> PJSalt PJSalt betting?
[0:36:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and launcher can stage switch which is neat
[0:36:17] <Applecannon63> Stun edge is indeed chargable
[0:36:19] <RichochetForce> Giovanna is a straight up SF character
[0:36:21] <+Chili_Daddy> yeah I'm pretty sure it does @crimsonsaens
[0:36:21] <Zeppelee> Yeah, Ky becomes more Tense with DI.
[0:36:26] <princegeo> akatsuki combos
[0:36:28] <TanyaSaberFace> the wolf needs to come out more
[0:36:30] <+TopTieramisu> giovanna is a kof character
[0:36:34] <RichochetForce> She's a more reserved Jam
[0:36:35] <@Solidus_113> She's got Shrek mode
[0:36:36] <+TopTieramisu> design-wise
[0:36:38] <+Deko_> not enough doggo
[0:36:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Scaef Dog
[0:36:42] <TigerClaws12> dog is part of the drip
[0:36:44] <Applecannon63> Giovanna doggo set up
[0:36:53] <gunstars20> it's a scarf
[0:36:54] <%SableS139a> I'm still hoping that Sol has Dragon Install confirmed on his end, even if it's input is remapped since that's been his thing since the start.
[0:37:00] <AllenDeadman> Dog is a scarf
[0:37:04] <%ggbhtg> What should I practice to prepare for Strive's beta, +R or XRD? @WoolieVersus
[0:37:06] <anarchistPastry> Dogplay HahaSweat
[0:37:06] <+Chili_Daddy> The Dog only is rly involved in her 2nd super
[0:37:08] <stabbityrabbit> Everybody wanted EZ-Mode-Zato but we got Discount-Jam.
[0:37:11] <Zeppelee> She fuses with the dog in her Special.
[0:37:13] <+BuckizcoBeet> Woolie doing MUGEN? Let's friggin' go! KomodoHype
[0:37:13] <+loukemia83> Dog should be more like Poppy or Eddie, it's disappointing
[0:37:22] <+TopTieramisu> giovanna unleashed
[0:37:26] <%SableS139a> As for Giovanna. She could use more doggo implementation. It kinda hurts how little Rei is utilized.
[0:37:37] <gunstars20> YOINK
[0:37:40] <Applecannon63> she has her Doggo in her super doing some set ups
[0:37:46] <TigerClaws12> "i'm a jet now" - Sol
[0:37:47] <AllenDeadman> They did tell us she was gonna be just a punch girl, they never said anything about the dog doing anything
[0:37:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie playing Mugen. First pick is gonna be a fate character.
[0:37:53] <+TopTieramisu> giovanna is the character for new players
[0:37:54] <+loukemia83> Heavy Mob Cemetary reminds me of OG Breathless
[0:37:54] <+ghostfaceninja_> everybody wants any pet to act like a stando
[0:37:57] <Ner234> Heavy Mob Cemetery. What a name.
[0:37:58] <+TopTieramisu> can't make her too complex
[0:38:01] <@Solidus_113> When Sajam broke it down I think he said the startup was 13 frames
[0:38:02] <BlackermanZX> i hope they eventually add dragon install for sol again
[0:38:06] <%ggbhtg> Feels like a bit of callback to his GG1 IK
[0:38:09] <stabbityrabbit> They said it was grab I thought.
[0:38:12] <%ggbhtg> with the fire river
[0:38:15] <crimsonsaens> @SableS139a Originally, DI was on S, not HS. So it is still possible for him to have it.
[0:38:15] <pixel_river> it looks brutal
[0:38:19] <%nintega010> I like that the Gio wolf is used more in normal than like Poppy or Eddy.
[0:38:19] <Dablackone> !uptime
[0:38:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 49 minutes and 48 seconds
[0:38:30] <@Solidus_113> The run across the screen looks to be about 5 frames
[0:38:35] <TigerClaws12> don't whiff
[0:38:43] <%SableS139a> @crimsonsaens If that's the case, there's no reason for Sol NOT to have it. Here's hoping it happens.
[0:38:43] <%Mrbaconator> YE AXLE
[0:38:46] <Applecannon63> Heavy Mob Cemetery should follow up to his Dragon install like Super Broly's Level 3 super giving him a buff
[0:38:47] <TigerClaws12> One Vision
[0:38:49] <BlackermanZX> one vision actually
[0:38:50] <%Irridium> YEYE MY BOY
[0:38:51] <gunstars20> HOLD THAT
[0:38:51] <+TheNeutralGame> One Vision
[0:38:51] <%Mrbaconator> ONE VISION SCUM LORD
[0:38:53] <Solidnick18> that looks pretty busted
[0:38:54] <NeroIscariot12> Its One Vision @WoolieVersus
[0:38:54] <+b_aleph> ICHI WARUDO
[0:38:56] <BlackermanZX> Za warudo
[0:38:56] <%nintega010> Have more health
[0:38:58] <+ghostfaceninja_> ZA ONE WARUDO
[0:38:58] <AllenDeadman> you kill him Kappa
[0:38:59] <DaCheekyOne> Everyone's an axl player now
[0:39:01] <pixel_river> you need star platinaum
[0:39:02] <aka_Jigawatt> ZA VISION
[0:39:05] <Zeppelee> Axl is just Heritage!Jotaro.
[0:39:07] <+Chili_Daddy> Maybe he loses it if you knock him down? @WoolieVersus
[0:39:08] <%ggbhtg> One Vision, that song from Digimon Tamers?? PogChamp
[0:39:10] <+BarbosaEdit> JOJO CHARACTER ALERT
[0:39:11] <RayCSmooth> You just take it Kappa
[0:39:12] <%Irridium> just don't let him 4Head
[0:39:12] <gulthrax> What arc of the Woolie saga is this?
[0:39:13] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I have a theory that it's a hit super still. but we'll see
[0:39:18] <+b_aleph> One vision? The song from Laibach?
[0:39:18] <BlackermanZX> he literally does the jotaro pose from heritage
[0:39:23] <+seydaq> Axl's warudo!
[0:39:28] <stabbityrabbit> Already One Vision is looking stupid. I think it'd have more counterplay if he lost the time stop after being hit.
[0:39:29] <Zeppelee> @ggbhtg It's a Queen song.
[0:39:29] <@Solidus_113> you can activate it in reaction to any button
[0:39:38] <+loukemia83> He whiff punishes with it
[0:39:45] <%SableS139a> Axl just pulls out The World like Jotaro, Dio, and fucking Sakuya. Only his start-up is hella fast after prepping it. It's fucking stupid and I'm scared shitless.
[0:39:49] <+seydaq> season 1 tekken rage problems
[0:39:50] <Jashter18> Okay but important question what happens in an Axl mirror match
[0:39:51] <TheArrow_> if you're holding down back can he jump on you?
[0:39:54] <TigerClaws12> just don't whiff 4Head
[0:39:57] <DeathByPoke7> no jumping allowed
[0:40:03] <gunstars20> Ah gottem ggs
[0:40:12] <%Mrbaconator> skedaddle skadoodle i control neutral
[0:40:14] <+ghostfaceninja_> there's gotta be some counter play to it, like burst or something
[0:40:14] <@Solidus_113> skidaddle skidoodle, I control neutral
[0:40:14] <Solidnick18> everyone is broken it's great
[0:40:16] <BlackermanZX> "I AM the neutral now" doodNuts

[0:40:18] <%ggbhtg> "Guess you'll die *shrug* "
[0:40:22] <+Chili_Daddy> I bet its blockable
[0:40:23] <+Dova573> stands
[0:40:27] <pixel_river> he used it on ramlethal , just ran up to her and ended it lol
[0:40:38] <AllenDeadman> skidadle skidoodle I don't wanna play neutral
[0:40:42] <TigerClaws12> her rose is just a move now LUL
[0:40:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah
[0:40:50] <+Chili_Daddy> No pin but her mobility and left right seems even better
[0:40:53] <Solidnick18> nah
[0:40:54] <@Solidus_113> Milia still out here playing Xrd
[0:40:57] <+SvenHolgersson> Yo what if they kissed haha
[0:41:00] <+SvenHolgersson> Thats would be weird
[0:41:01] <%SableS139a> "Bitch, did you whiff? That's a free punish for me. Free real estate."
[0:41:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> she's gonna make refunds skyrocket for new players

[0:41:24] <TigerClaws12> hips definitely lying
[0:41:28] <+SvenHolgersson> GG doesn't need balance
[0:41:29] <Zeppelee> At least Millia can still Hair Car.
[0:41:30] <%wibbwobbler> maaan
[0:41:30] <+ghostfaceninja_> people already theorizing flow charts LUL
[0:41:32] <pixel_river> big hips indeed
[0:41:36] <+SvenHolgersson> It needs crazy horsehit for everyone
[0:41:44] <Applecannon63> Leo is an "ALL ROUNDER"
[0:41:45] <+SvenHolgersson> Everybody broken
[0:41:51] <%ggbhtg> What should I practice to prepare for Strive's beta, +R or XRD? @WoolieVersus
[0:41:52] <%SableS139a> I'm kinda hoping that I can run Millia though. I've always liked her, but I could never play her for shit. Same goes for Dizzy.
[0:42:00] <Solidnick18> very good
[0:42:03] <pixel_river> wanna try ram and giovanna
[0:42:03] <stabbityrabbit> Leo has the stupidest looking command grab I've seen.
[0:42:05] <MutedMimic> LUL
[0:42:07] <+TopTieramisu> no bridget, no fidget
[0:42:11] <Zeppelee> @ggbhtg XRD.
[0:42:13] <gulthrax> has he commented about the quality of the butt rock yet?
[0:42:14] <RichochetForce> My guess is Ariels
[0:42:15] <@Solidus_113> we have training mode this time
[0:42:17] <+SvenHolgersson> Touch....My....Choices
[0:42:18] <+loukemia83> I wanna tough Mai - Woolie 2021
[0:42:24] <RichochetForce> Ariels already has a canon weapon
[0:42:28] <Applecannon63> Leo has Alex'a HYPER BOMB
[0:42:33] <+Chili_Daddy> Asuka, Aria or Elphelt
[0:42:37] <%SableS139a> We finally have a lab. >FeelsGoodMan
[0:42:48] <@Solidus_113> you can spend all friday in training mode
[0:42:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just don't sleep for the duration of the demo, ez
[0:42:49] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:42:49] <+TopTieramisu> they totally are gonna lock baiken behind DLC aren't they
[0:42:50] <RichochetForce> Elphelt no longer exists though
[0:42:53] <Zeppelee> Aria for sure.
[0:42:55] <Solidnick18> kinda wanna check may out
[0:42:55] <DaCheekyOne> You gonna stream the beta @WoolieVersus ?
[0:42:55] <pixel_river> Zato looks hella dope
[0:42:55] <DatAsuna> Well you still gotta do some lab for the matchup if nothing else
[0:42:58] <stabbityrabbit> @RichochetForce Same. My long shot call is Asuka as final DLC character for wave one.
[0:43:06] <RichochetForce> @TopTieramisu Absolutely. She makes them WAY too much money
[0:43:06] <+SvenHolgersson> Giovanna is day one
[0:43:06] <+Chili_Daddy> why would she not exist LUL
[0:43:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> @toptieramisu, everytime? EVERYTIME
[0:43:10] <Applecannon63> Elphet is gonna be dlc
[0:43:10] <crimsonsaens> I've got to try them all
[0:43:11] <gulthrax> is this a disciple of lord woolie?
[0:43:14] <%SableS139a> Yeah. Elphelt, Baiken, Dizzy, Venom. Probably all DLC at this point.
[0:43:23] <%LastHazzerd> Drill kick
[0:43:28] <RichochetForce> @stabbityrabbit That's another good one. Eventually the original trio WILL be playable.
[0:43:34] <TigerClaws12> Akatsuki tatsu
[0:43:38] <%Struggleful> In b4 I commit to a character and they announce one my old mains afterwards
[0:43:38] <%nintega010> Giovanna reminds me of KOF.
[0:43:46] <pixel_river> her attacks looks very cool
[0:43:47] <@Solidus_113> She gets stronger the more tension she has
[0:43:53] <+b_aleph> @nintega010 she's tanned Vanessa
[0:43:53] <laserbeaming> God Mode? Nah, DOG MODE
[0:43:57] <Applecannon63> Maybe they'll change that in her guidline video
[0:43:59] <+Chili_Daddy> Nah actually I'm thinking it has the be a new charcter so its Asuka, Aria or Delilah
[0:43:59] <+TopTieramisu> giovanna is basically thicc vannessa
[0:44:02] <+Liquirill> "dry"?
[0:44:06] <%LastHazzerd> did woolie see the unoficial gio combo vid?
[0:44:14] <BackwardCap> Personally, despite the changes, im still hyped for Ramlethal.
[0:44:14] <aka_Jigawatt> nago's wet af
[0:44:15] <+SvenHolgersson> Nago has so much Slayer stuff I can't not love him
[0:44:16] <Zeppelee> Please tell me that you've seen the Tifa mod for Tekken.
[0:44:22] <%nintega010> I'm pretty much Playing Sol or Giovanna
[0:44:31] <+Chili_Daddy> Hakumen + ABA seems tight LUL
[0:44:43] <+b_aleph> Leo is still the sickest
[0:44:46] <BlackermanZX> i hope they actually add ABA at some point
[0:44:48] <+TenguGemini> no anji fans?
[0:44:57] <Applecannon63> Anji is meh
[0:44:58] <+BarbosaEdit> slayer+baiken
[0:44:59] <+Chili_Daddy> Nah screw Fuujin
[0:44:59] <gulthrax> has woolie pontificated about strive's lore yet?
[0:45:02] <Zeppelee> @tengugemini I LOVE Anji!
[0:45:08] <+SvenHolgersson> ABA should be the last dlc character
[0:45:13] <+b_aleph> @TenguGemini you in the wrong channel man, we hate anji mito here
[0:45:19] <Applecannon63> I mean his butterfly is the only thing good about Anji
[0:45:20] <SpookyMooks> what're they talking about?
[0:45:21] <laserbeaming> I'll probably main May
[0:45:25] <pixel_river> @BackwardCap for me its hard to tell if changes to characters where bad or not, it depends on how the whole feels to me first
[0:45:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> don't hold your breath on ABA guys
[0:45:26] <+b_aleph> Ask Woolie
[0:45:28] <+Chili_Daddy> Plz no Zappa or Testament LUL
[0:45:29] <+Liquirill> what happens when he "goes over"?
[0:45:36] <%LionheartedRebel> I'm a dirty Sol main so.
[0:45:36] <gunstars20> Nago blood meter
[0:45:44] <Applecannon63> Testament invisible traps
[0:45:46] <%nintega010> @Chili_Daddy My man.
[0:45:49] <gulthrax> @LionheartedRebel same here, guv
[0:45:53] <%Struggleful> I'm likely maining a DLC character
[0:45:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> @b_aleph Didn't Woolie roll back his dislike of Anji a bit?
[0:45:56] <%ggbhtg> P R E S H O W
[0:45:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NAgoriyuki's Odachi isn't for bonking the opponent, but bonking the blood meter

[1:02:36] <TigerClaws12> i swear to god if there's KBD
[1:02:37] <%yusefHD> Better than fantasy strike for sure LUL
[1:02:37] <enerkaizer> Plus the knees of yuri are way to low. That's why her walk cycle is off
[1:02:38] <RichochetForce> Yeah, font sucks
[1:02:42] <Mirakei> I was excited for the Muay Thai girl after woolie was hyping her up but she's just genderbent Sagat ResidentSleeper
[1:02:43] <+SvenHolgersson> Dam Dad is hot
[1:02:44] <RichochetForce> Bad fonts make it easy to confuse letters
[1:02:51] <jetjagger222> @enerkaizer fuck can't unsee

[1:03:11] <jetjagger222> her knees are in her shins

[1:03:39] <+b_aleph> holy shit those are some low knees indeed
[1:03:40] <%LastHazzerd> it does seem pretty tekken
[1:03:43] <Applecannon63> I'm like the combos design
[1:03:52] <+MugenSandan> gotta admit... I'm not about the pigtails on the Muay Thai girl

[1:03:58] <stormhawk9891> HER NECK BROKE
[1:03:58] <BurdRightsActivist> Wait what gaem is this, because this doesn't look like mugen at all
[1:04:06] <MahoganyWoods> This track slaps.
[1:04:09] <jetjagger222> wow that didn't look right at all
[1:04:09] <xUrbanCarnage> This music isn’t great ngl
[1:04:09] <stabbityrabbit> Dao is the old character, but she's the better looking one.
[1:04:09] <RichochetForce> I've never been a fan of pigtails in general
[1:04:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Joezombiefoe
[1:04:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mugen Engine
[1:04:16] <jetjagger222> music's too overwrought lol

[1:04:23] <%xemnahort> Yeah I couldn’t see the problem til you mentioned the low knees those are very strange
[1:04:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> has there ever been a shaved head female character in a fighting game?
[1:04:30] <+TopTieramisu> tkd girl's design is also basic af
[1:04:53] <DedlokPM> @BurdRightsActivist Furia Royale, but it is indeed mugen but HEAVILY modifided
[1:05:02] <Apolonm> same face

[1:05:30] <+TopTieramisu> i'm into big lady
[1:05:38] <jetjagger222> lol the dummy's design is actually pretty good
[1:05:39] <Prevot> @ghostfaceninja_ villain of the last MK

[1:05:49] <TigerClaws12> is this the Cross Tekken sequel? kappa
[1:05:50] <RichochetForce> Dummy looks like it could be a real character
[1:05:50] <CrimsonDragoon23> Wait, THIS is MUGEN??? With 3D Models?!?!

[1:06:37] <%LastHazzerd> DoA?
[1:06:48] <%blaccbird914> OH its Ybot!
[1:06:51] <RichochetForce> Yeah, this reminds me of DOA's tag
[1:06:55] <enerkaizer> yeah, that dummy sadly looks more like a character then the others because it has a distinct body shape and feels more designed in turn
[1:06:58] <HoodedCape> wow this si really impressive
[1:06:59] <%yusefHD> OH
[1:06:59] <TigerClaws12> mist step? PogChamp

[1:07:23] <jetjagger222> @enerkaizer even the dummy's stance is pretty good
[1:07:31] <fernanda_ps2> so is this sprites
[1:07:32] <rameiramaster> Does this mean I can insert ssj 5 Broly made by a 12 year old in Brazil from like, 2007?
[1:07:42] <fernanda_ps2> like donkey kong sprites
[1:07:43] <%yusefHD> Yugo Bloody roar shit loool i love it

[1:08:00] <+Shmario> wait this is mugen? WutFace
[1:08:02] <RichochetForce> This is a heavily modified MUGEN
[1:08:14] <TigerClaws12> oops, all tekken
[1:08:32] <kevamadi> So, this is basically M.U.K.K.E.N?
[1:08:39] <fernanda_ps2> otg's found?
[1:08:39] <+TopTieramisu> does dad have an alt look?
[1:08:56] <+Liquirill> might sprites converted from 3d model snapshots
[1:09:00] <+Liquirill> might be*
[1:09:07] <DaKnightWarrior> I can't believe this was made in mugen. wow.
[1:09:12] <Applecannon63> this stage look so good looking
[1:09:13] <TigerClaws12> oh god the move list PTSD is back NotLikeThis
[1:09:20] <+Artemis_Scowl> Im loving Sagirl

[1:10:04] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Woolie, thanks for getting me into games by Super Giant. Way back when you were praising Transistor so I gave it a shot. Now I'm a huge fan of all their games!
[1:10:06] <%xemnahort> Woolie totally picked character change
[1:10:06] <SPidERMan8576> This turtle stole all my info
[1:10:15] <TanyaSaberFace> lunar new year stage would be fitting
[1:10:17] <jetjagger222> turtle house
[1:10:25] <rameiramaster> The hair on Dao looks like a wig ngl
[1:10:28] <TigerClaws12> F keys?
[1:10:30] <RichochetForce> Whoa, sounds like GiantRat had a blast
[1:10:46] <RichochetForce> Supergiant are fantastic
[1:10:51] <+waltzqueen> @rameiramaster perfect for cosplay then if her canon hair looks like a wig
[1:11:12] <RaidenRising> is that rule 63 sagat?
[1:11:14] <rameiramaster> @waltzqueen That's a 300 IQ move righ there
[1:11:32] <datdemo> yo clinch mechanincs!? PogChamp
[1:11:33] <%TheLastStar> now I see the Mugen LUL
[1:11:33] <+waltzqueen> Super giant is wonderufl @GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz enjoy their catalog
[1:11:36] <SPidERMan8576> Is that astolfo
[1:11:39] <%paladinstarbuster> her hair reeks of wanting to cover her a ponytail but thinking it would be too unoriginal
[1:11:50] <enerkaizer> quarter circle motions NotLikeThis I hope that fighting games devs one day realize that this control pattern is part of the reason fighters have fallen off mainstream
[1:11:58] <jetjagger222> @paladinstarbuster god forbid she'd have a monkhon
[1:12:03] <Polar_Bair_8> LUL
[1:12:04] <RichochetForce> I don't think fighting game devs care anymore
[1:12:06] <TigerClaws12> i saw parry
[1:12:08] <+Seiryu99> Oh damn WS moves
[1:12:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> people forgetting this a passion project by a handful of people, its gonna have its aesthetic issues
[1:12:20] <RichochetForce> None of them has really tried to go for mainstream appeal outside of Smash or MK
[1:12:30] <TigerClaws12> snu snu
[1:12:33] <+TopTieramisu> cmon, you can't be complaining about qcf
[1:12:40] <VirkaLlon> BOSS UNIT picued my interest
[1:12:44] <Polar_Bair_8> idk, where are the interesting games without motions
[1:12:56] <Polar_Bair_8> Fantasy Strike LUL
[1:13:00] <+jiggy_snipe> keep going
[1:13:01] <+TopTieramisu> even tekken has qcf and even a more strict dp motion
[1:13:07] <Applecannon63> qcf inputs are okay just no Pretzel motions
[1:13:11] <Jp_DrZaius> LUL
[1:13:13] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:13:16] <blue6sub6remnant6> Granblue has quick buttons IIRC.
[1:13:21] <RichochetForce> I desire x2 720 motions
[1:13:22] <%yusefHD> Betting time is now over LUL
[1:13:26] <jetjagger222> pretzel's p much a SNK thing
[1:13:28] <RaidenRising> kof motions boi

[1:13:35] <kevamadi> @enerkaizer This. So many credible fgc heads are in complete denial about this...
[1:13:35] <BlackermanZX> doodInjury doodInjury oodInjury
[1:13:37] <pmda2126> 5 min war
[1:13:39] <+waltzqueen> time: Yes
[1:13:45] <%xemnahort> Quarter circle is the easiest motion 360s and charge motions are the real killers of mainstream
[1:13:55] <BlackermanZX> doodInjury doodInjury doodTerror
[1:13:58] <jetjagger222> power rangers does directional specials well
[1:14:07] <RichochetForce> @xemnahort Most casuals can't do a QCF, but can fire The Fornite Gun
[1:14:15] <Applecannon63> QCF motions/Charge motions>Pretzel motions
[1:14:24] <+DeeJayOkay> can we talk about the fucking surprising banger soundtrack?
[1:14:26] <TanyaSaberFace> lunar new years
[1:14:28] <+DeeJayOkay> 'cause like... the fuck
[1:14:28] <TanyaSaberFace> aw
[1:14:31] <RichochetForce> Yes, the music is strong
[1:14:34] <Solidnick18> ripper chan PogChamp
[1:14:40] <enerkaizer> @xemnahort not really, the entire qcm system is completly outdated in my mind and needs to go. Heck, even the devs slowly but surely see this which is why for example chargers are going away
[1:14:43] <+waltzqueen> The Referee voice sounds like the Judge from Paradise Killer
[1:14:44] <+Liquirill> ripperchan AYAYAYA
[1:14:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Ripper-chan" Wait a minute, this isn't the old channel.
[1:14:55] <%xemnahort> Music is very sbfpYeyeye
[1:14:56] <+TopTieramisu> the music, presentation, and levels are better than the character designs imo
[1:15:04] <enerkaizer> Okay, Chainsaw girl is a winner design
[1:15:11] <jorniev> THIS IS MUGEN!?
[1:15:18] <Applecannon63> man people are cowards when they motion inputs
[1:15:22] <Santos_404> yo what is this game LMAO
[1:15:30] <Applecannon63> *see motion inputs
[1:15:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> qcm motions are fine
[1:15:42] <RichochetForce> It's because there's no real place for motion inputs anymore
[1:15:42] <stabbityrabbit> Y'all really out here shit-talking charge characters huh?
[1:15:49] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:15:50] <RaidenRising> jesus
[1:15:57] <RAH001> ... i feel like afro samurai is about to show up
[1:15:57] <%xemnahort> @enerkaizer can you give examples of that because I have seen no evidence of this
[1:15:58] <DaKnightWarrior> SingsNote CoolCat SingsNote
[1:15:59] <+TopTieramisu> no real place?
[1:15:59] <jorniev> YEAH SLEEPING DOGS
[1:16:00] <Estuko> Oohoo
[1:16:02] <RichochetForce> You can't complain games aren't mainstream and then love things that prevent them from being mainstream.
[1:16:02] <Solidnick18> wei shen type beat
[1:16:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't like charge characters cause i'm just not good at charge moves
[1:16:15] <+TopTieramisu> no real place, smh
[1:16:20] <+b_aleph> ask anyone, jackie ma still looks dead
[1:16:24] <%wibbwobbler> woolieMIRIN
[1:16:32] <+TopTieramisu> good luck making tekken with fantasy strike inputs
[1:16:34] <datdemo> EVen If they get rid of motions you'll still suck
[1:16:35] <RichochetForce> @TopTieramisu Sorry, but a lot of this genre is locked into hidebound traditions with no place in the modern market
[1:16:46] <RichochetForce> And I say that as someone who's been playing FG since SF2 vanilla
[1:16:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> trust me, if i could actually get good with charge i'd be playing F.A.N.G. every day
[1:16:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:16:56] <RichochetForce> You want mainstream, you give the mainstream what they want.
[1:16:59] <rameiramaster> Or maybe, Fighting Games just haven't been the hot shit with the kids since forever. It's not rocket science. Popularity comes in waves
[1:17:03] <jetjagger222> yes and end up like star wars
[1:17:06] <+TopTieramisu> fighting games will never break the mainstream like fortnite or lol because they're individual games without teams to protect your ego
[1:17:07] <Arek_1> @enerkaizer What people forget or don't realize is that special moves are balanced by the difficulty or the amount of time required by their inputs. Geese's Raging Storm? Invincible and great anti-air? How fair would that be if it was done with just one button?
[1:17:10] <RichochetForce> If you want to do you, accept tiny markets and living in the shadow of MK and Smash.
[1:17:12] <+ghostfaceninja_> more than a little
[1:17:16] <enerkaizer> @xemnahort There are less and less chargers created from what I've seen, and most roster nowadays are made out of either qcm or grappler rotation characters (with maybe weird gimmick characters inbetween)
[1:17:19] <stabbityrabbit> @CaptainPileDriver This level of honesty I can respect. I find charge moves easier than a lot of motions, so I like the option for them.
[1:17:21] <Applecannon63> yikes so kich bad takes are in this chat
[1:17:21] <Solidnick18> giant woman
[1:17:26] <RichochetForce> Business and Pleasure are to completely different things
[1:17:30] <BlackermanZX> giant woman doodLewd
[1:17:33] <RaidenRising> is that dio ?
[1:17:35] <Polar_Bair_8> MK isn't successful because it doesn't have QCFs lol it's successful because it's got gore
[1:17:35] <RAH001> brian?
[1:17:40] <+MugenSandan> I just don't get the timing of charging moves
[1:17:47] <Solidnick18> oooh
[1:17:47] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:17:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> LUL yea its Brianne of Tarth
[1:17:52] <Solidnick18> hmm?
[1:17:53] <%xemnahort> @enerkaizer again examples please because I have seen no drop in chargers at all
[1:17:55] <RichochetForce> AYYYY
[1:17:55] <RAH001> oh wait
[1:17:57] <VirkaLlon> Dimitrescu vibes
[1:17:58] <verscoll> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:18:00] <enerkaizer> Now I know why the giant woman looks familiar. She resembles the female superman standin from Ladybug
[1:18:00] <+TopTieramisu> business strategy talk in twitch chat LUL
[1:18:01] <%yusefHD> Ryu autodouble punch too
[1:18:17] <+jiggy_snipe> @FuqBoiSlim stop this man, his ideas are too strong
[1:18:18] <%ChoculaUltra> telepathic controls would be p sick ngl
[1:18:26] <Polar_Bair_8> uh oh the blindspots
[1:18:28] <Hideow> what in tarnation is this
[1:18:30] <Polar_Bair_8> character sucks pls buff
[1:18:34] <Potatoidea> giant MMA amazon woman vs. kimono lady w/ chainsaw and... just someone doing taekwondo
[1:18:39] <stabbityrabbit> @MugenSandan That's 90% of learning charge characters. B.B. Hood actually makes this really easy with specifically B.B. Hood.
[1:18:40] <jetjagger222> yup she got marduk moves
[1:18:41] <+Liquirill> sorry, but what i'm getting from some people here: "ruin something to make it mainstream - it will be totally worth it."
[1:18:45] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, tkd character is so basic
[1:18:50] <gulthrax> snake mountain > splash mountain PogChamp
[1:18:59] <%paladinstarbuster> I taught children over the holidays how to play Dbfz the motions weren't the issue
[1:19:10] <Solidnick18> steve fox
[1:19:16] <RichochetForce> @Liquirill This is why most people make for horrible businesspeople. You don't make what you want to play, you make people want to buy.
[1:19:23] <Applecannon63> man the mindset of casuals is indeed disgusting
[1:19:27] <RichochetForce> what people want to buy*
[1:19:27] <Jail_House_Lock> if someone told me 10 years ago people will be complaining about a quarter circle forward...jesus
[1:19:31] <+jiggy_snipe> fighting games are lowering the execution barrier via shortcuts but they still aren't super popular
[1:19:31] <badjab326> Bryan Fury
[1:19:34] <enerkaizer> @Liquirill can't ruin something that is already broken to beginn with. Just compare how many people would rather play smash compared to any qcm fighter. you'd be shocked to see the result
[1:19:42] <kevamadi> @arek_1 You're missing the point entirely. The argument is for games DESIGNED around simplified inputs...
[1:19:44] <Polar_Bair_8> IT HAS NINTENDO CHARACTERS
[1:19:52] <datdemo> People play Smash because of the characters
[1:19:55] <Polar_Bair_8> you cannot be real right now lol
[1:19:58] <RichochetForce> @jiggy_snipe Because that's not their only problem for lowering the threshold and bringing in new players.
[1:20:00] <Estuko> I like to hit the buttons
[1:20:09] <+ghostfaceninja_> my question is, why does every fighting game have to appeal to casuals and hardcores? like, isn't there room for both types of fighting games?
[1:20:11] <%xemnahort> @enerkaizer even granblue has charge characters so where are you getting that chargers are getting rarer?
[1:20:17] <Shardlab> @datdemo YUP
[1:20:19] <+TopTieramisu> this guy's really advocating for designing game by committee over actual vision
[1:20:22] <Potatoidea> Is that Sagat?
[1:20:31] <+Liquirill> @RichochetForce @enerkaizer i care about what i enjoy. the world is big enough for niches. money isnt the only means to measure value.
[1:20:33] <Polar_Bair_8> mf saw Vega wasn't charge anymore and decided charge characters were dead
[1:20:34] <jetjagger222> its also a community thing; you'll tend to play what your friends play. MOBAs are more complex than modern FGs for the most part but they dont have a problem getting a community
[1:20:38] <RichochetForce> @ghostfaceninja_ Sure. But the people making the niche fighting games should expect dead lobbies and low sales.
[1:20:39] <Applecannon63> casual would get scared about complicated shit
[1:20:39] <Solidnick18> ohh woah
[1:20:40] <%ChoculaUltra> we need more stance characters dammit
[1:20:40] <BlackermanZX> why the burds tho doodWat
[1:20:45] <DDDorsett> Room? LUL
[1:20:51] <%paladinstarbuster> smash is way harder to play at higher levels than a normal fighter

[1:20:55] <DDDorsett> What Room? LUL

[1:21:17] <Polar_Bair_8> yeah I agree everyone should only make boring mass marketable things
[1:21:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> tbh they're are other platform fighters that play better than ultimate but no one is flocking to those for a reason I feel
[1:21:22] <RichochetForce> @Liquirill Dude, I say this as someone that enjoys French Bread and GG fighting games. I know what you mean. But every fucking year we heard fighting games devs struggle to attract new customers.
[1:21:24] <RaidenRising> dude my 10 yo sister play mobas, casuals learn to play something they like
[1:21:27] <Polar_Bair_8> this is also why it's good that Disney has a big monopoly
[1:21:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> *there are. lmaoo
[1:21:35] <BlackermanZX> oh yuri is just kung fu man with boobs
[1:21:40] <badjab326> THIS IS MUGEN!?!?
[1:21:42] <badjab326> WTF
[1:21:42] <Polar_Bair_8> wouldn't want anything too creative and interesting to be made b/c it wouldn't have mass appeal 4Head
[1:21:52] <chll0ne> whatre we arguing about? lol
[1:21:58] <jetjagger222> motion inputs
[1:22:05] <Applecannon63> casual afraid of motion inputs
[1:22:07] <+jiggy_snipe> @FuqBoiSlim probably the lack of Nintendo and now other company characters
[1:22:08] <enerkaizer> @Polar_Bair_8 explain what makes qcm creative please. You do know why this system was invented, right?
[1:22:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mugen strikes again
[1:22:12] <PhantomMaskJr> Keep it 💯
[1:22:12] <+ghostfaceninja_> I def think FG devs can learn a thing or two from MOBAs
[1:22:13] <%faeron93> Early BETA
[1:22:18] <Jail_House_Lock> idk why anyone would have hope about fighting games being mainstream, thats never gonna happen lol. Its like wanting ace combat games to be mainstream
[1:22:19] <RichochetForce> Anti-Mugen
[1:22:22] <BlackermanZX> and now everything is fucked doodDrool
[1:22:25] <%ChoculaUltra> mugen bones
[1:22:32] <+BarbosaEdit> can you flip reggies camera pls
[1:22:33] <RAH001> " keep tekken in mind an i guess you will find, an asian man that does not like to be asked for shit"
[1:22:33] <Polar_Bair_8> I'm just arguing that it's dumb to say "you should only make things that will sell well"
[1:22:34] <+Liquirill> @RichochetForce if things have to change like you say, then im sure it will happen eventually. time will tell.
[1:22:46] <Arek_1> @Polar_Bair_8 Changing Vega to a motion character was a good change. Vega has fast walk speeds and is mobile. Being a charge character held him back. And his special moves weren't even that good enough to necessitate being charge input.
[1:22:50] <%DaRoosta89> the fuck
[1:22:51] <DedlokPM> @chll0ne people on both sides of the mainstream argument taking it to extremese on both sides
[1:23:00] <RichochetForce> @Jail_House_Lock Hearing AC7 sold 2.5 MILLION made me so goddamn happy. By Kono's admission they barely got the game funded and completed.
[1:23:29] <TanyaSaberFace> BibleThump
[1:23:29] <chll0ne> @dedlokpm i see lool LUL
[1:23:29] <Applecannon63> I' m casual and even think this argument is stupid
[1:23:31] <jetjagger222> @RichochetForce and for good reason because its a damn excellent game
[1:23:39] <Jail_House_Lock> yeah AC7 its awesome
[1:23:44] <PhantomMaskJr> I’ve be following the guy that’s making this game on Twitter good to see how much progress he’s made
[1:23:50] <%Struggleful> I love me some empty lobbies...
[1:23:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:24:04] <Applecannon63> oh cute
[1:24:05] <Hideow> Hold up,is this mugen?
[1:24:09] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:24:09] <RichochetForce> @jetjagger222 Yeah, seeing it come back strong like that made me happy as fuck. Same goes for SCVI after the LONG silence after SFV
[1:24:10] <%TheBensonator_> This aesthetic tho
[1:24:20] <jetjagger222> OK this stage is legit
[1:24:25] <+TopTieramisu> easy inputs isn't gonna stop a noob from getting stomped. proper tutorials is far more important for accessibility
[1:24:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jiggy_snipe yeah? recognizable characters are a big reason. I also feel like it's because it's a Smash game. Like, the mentality is "Smash will always have players so I'll stick to that so I'll always have someone to play with. Instead of investing in a game that's stuck in the discord dimension."
[1:24:27] <RichochetForce> This... music

[1:25:59] <+SvenHolgersson> THESE LADIES HOT AS FUCK
[1:26:01] <SpookyMooks> i would never guess this was a mugen game if i hadn't known before
[1:26:01] <+TopTieramisu> that's definitely not geisha makeup
[1:26:07] <datdemo> There's another big woman in this game
[1:26:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> LUL her thigh is as big as the other girls' torsos
[1:26:16] <RichochetForce> @TopTieramisu Chainsaw Kabuki?
[1:26:21] <jetjagger222> @ghostfaceninja_ just like miwako eyoooo
[1:26:21] <PhantomMaskJr> You can’t tell she pee’s standing up HahaDoge
[1:26:23] <Hideow> What a weird stance,even for MMA LUL
[1:26:25] <Heefnoff> Isn't this stage where Snake and Liquid fought in MGS4?
[1:26:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ayy we got Lady Chainsawman now?
[1:26:39] <+SvenHolgersson> Yo this already looks better than SFV
[1:26:41] <Afrosamasenpai> Nope. Just naps and undead chainsaw geishas were unexpected.
[1:27:00] <%Struggleful> Biscuit's true for too strong
[1:27:01] <+TopTieramisu> @RichochetForce yeah, look at kabuki makeup

[1:27:11] <%LastHazzerd> who'da thought the gladiator woman would have amazing pressure
[1:27:14] <Arek_1> How did this conversation complaining about quarter-circle forward motions even get started? No one that's a fan of Woolie and a fan of what he's into, fighting games, should be complaining about quarter-circle motions.
[1:27:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> PogChamp
[1:27:38] <+Coltbanana> Just joined, this aint mugen, what we watching gang?
[1:27:39] <Polar_Bair_8> it happens with any popular streamer tbh

[1:27:51] <PhantomMaskJr> bronzeEVIL
[1:27:52] <+TopTieramisu> kusoge is a pillar of the FGC
[1:27:54] <jetjagger222> its a bit too high effort and execution to be kusoge
[1:27:55] <RichochetForce> Cool
[1:27:56] <+ghostfaceninja_> I NEED to see what the crows do
[1:27:58] <Afrosamasenpai> yo dao tho
[1:28:00] <+skylerpilot> @Heefnoff nah, its where Raiden had to use his sniper rifle to save Otakon's step sister from being discovered by terrorists

[1:28:50] <+Coltbanana> whooaaa
[1:28:52] <+Coltbanana> this is mugen
[1:28:55] <+TopTieramisu> she's a pretty big lady herself
[1:28:56] <RichochetForce> Furiosa Royale is the name of the game
[1:28:57] <Garrett1405> @binaryfireball Heavily Modified Mugen
[1:28:57] <$marshallventure> mugen shenananananigans
[1:29:01] <%BinaryFireball> ahhhh
[1:29:05] <Applecannon63> cool mugen game
[1:29:05] <Polar_Bair_8> wait this IS mugen?
[1:29:08] <RichochetForce> Yes
[1:29:13] <+Liquirill> its a passion project guys, talented people are pouring years of blood sweat and tears into making this in their freetime.
[1:29:13] <%wibbwobbler> insane
[1:29:14] <%ChoculaUltra> mugen be this, yes
[1:29:15] <Heefnoff> Mugen is a fighting game engine, not one defined game
[1:29:17] <Polar_Bair_8> I thought there's no fuckin way something 3D is in mugen
[1:29:22] <+BarbosaEdit> leona vibes
[1:29:26] <+Coltbanana> I'm surprised yet I play DBZ mugen so I shouldn't be surprised
[1:29:28] <Applecannon63> Oh god Azumi is Mei
[1:29:31] <Polar_Bair_8> I've seen some shitpost USFIV characters in mugen but this is real
[1:29:31] <chll0ne> sourpls
[1:29:37] <RichochetForce> @Liquirill Yeah, this is much like Hollow Knight or Stardew Valley
[1:29:37] <Heefnoff> Yeah this is crazy shit
[1:29:41] <%BinaryFireball> you can make sprites from 3d easy
[1:29:41] <blue6sub6remnant6> Mugen is presumably like the unity engine, you can do a lot with it, but everybody really only expects it to do one thing and is surprised when it does more than than.
[1:29:43] <Doodicus110> Yoooo, what's good everyone! doodmaxhype
[1:29:47] <PhantomMaskJr> Chainsaw and bat girl would make a great team
[1:29:49] <%Struggleful> Gonna have to change the title to "Yes this is mugen" LUL
[1:29:52] <+MugenSandan> people have been able to get 3D characters into Mugen
[1:29:53] <+TopTieramisu> rashido
[1:29:56] <DDDorsett> People Uploaded SFV characters to MUGEN. Why are y'all suprised?
[1:29:57] <$marshallventure> damn, lifeline is on fire
[1:30:04] <%BinaryFireball> if you look at the legs you can see they still sprites
[1:30:06] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda reminds me of Leona
[1:30:11] <+ghostfaceninja_> Harley Quinn vibes
[1:30:13] <RichochetForce> @Doodicus110 Sup

[1:30:23] <+TopTieramisu> donkey kick
[1:30:23] <datdemo> @DDDorsett Alot of us checked out a LONG tiem go
[1:30:35] <+kevlarkoala> @DDDorsett because the average person stopped paying attention to MUGEN shortly after Salty Bet
[1:30:42] <TigerClaws12> look at this weeb
[1:30:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember a long time ago. I played this mugen character pack that was all jojo characters and I remember Diavolo's sprite being like a digitized version of his ASB model. I thought that was a fucking future and now here we are
[1:30:54] <Solidnick18> wait what
[1:30:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19

[1:31:07] <+TopTieramisu> that's a small ass spear she has
[1:31:08] <traceurfrenzy> Yeah, I'm familiar with MUGEN, I really should have asked what game/download :P
[1:31:12] <Chorkly> ps2 MK vibes
[1:31:17] <+Liquirill> i'm feeling this game for sure
[1:31:18] <$marshallventure> hi! save!
[1:31:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> SaltyBet is still very much alive
[1:31:27] <DatAsuna> @blue6sub6remnant6 having worked with both you're half right, but the two specificially aren't very similar, mostly because mugen doesn't make source code available so what devs can modify is much more limited.
[1:31:29] <Applecannon63> thats a Seiyari
[1:31:38] <%BinaryFireball> @ghostfaceninja_ ah thanks!

[1:33:48] <DatAsuna> @BinaryFireball salty bet still running yeah
[1:33:48] <enerkaizer> @TopTieramisu I think the character is based on the art-style of the ghost in the shell artist. Her cloths and generall design vibes atleast suggest that

[1:34:53] <+MugenSandan> out of curiosity is the voice acting just placeholder or is this all actual VA work done for this game?

[1:47:29] <GengarUsedCut> "MUGEN"
[1:47:30] <RichochetForce> Why you bully me?
[1:47:32] <+TopTieramisu> ROFL
[1:47:32] <%xemnahort> One complaint I can say is that when you get cornered you should still be able to see the character they should add closer borders so the characters don’t get cut in half
[1:47:34] <+black_pariah> DAMN
[1:47:35] <datdemo> rip
[1:47:36] <Afrosamasenpai> Tyra got a Galactica Phantom, A Flash Chop, and a Mika Headbutt. It's like she was made for me.

[1:48:27] <%xemnahort> @justtowatch it’s amazing how one phrase can describe my preferred fighting style so perfectly
[1:48:31] <Solidnick18> @PhantomMaskJr 👍🏻
[1:48:35] <%Struggleful> That right corner is getting JACKED UP from Reggie's character's hitting it
[1:48:43] <+TopTieramisu> the bryan fury
[1:48:45] <+ghostfaceninja_> Tyra Banks best character
[1:48:49] <MutedMimic> crumpetHappy

[1:48:55] <RichochetForce> Team Independent Women
[1:48:59] <PhantomMaskJr> castleheadLOL
[1:49:02] <+Coltbanana> Tyra is just kickboxing rhea ripley
[1:49:04] <%JustToWatch> @xemnahort there is a purity to that style
[1:49:07] <+Coltbanana> won't have anyone disagree
[1:49:16] <GengarUsedCut> why does woolie still have SBFP link in his twitch desc
[1:49:38] <TigerClaws12> is there wave dashing?
[1:49:38] <enerkaizer> A good chunk of the cast is barefoot. I honestly would like a character who has a move were she just stomps on the other characters feet for a stun or something. would atleast make sense
[1:49:49] <datdemo> Ripper has a rekka btw
[1:49:49] <Saltmeisterr> what game is this?
[1:49:53] <Saltmeisterr> just got here
[1:49:56] <+TopTieramisu> but the chainsaw-kabuki randomly wears sneakers
[1:49:58] <datdemo> Furia Royale
[1:50:01] <%Struggleful> @enerkaizer That Kamaru Usman special
[1:50:04] <+TopTieramisu> she should be wearing clogs
[1:50:15] <+black_pariah> @GengarUsedCut its an archive of his past content, why not
[1:50:27] <BluBox> Whiffin in punching range smh
[1:50:29] <GengarUsedCut> @black_pariah yeah thats true. just curioius really
[1:50:50] <chll0ne> bitch got a chainsaw
[1:50:54] <%xemnahort> @enerkaizer I agree with you but the main takeaway I got from your comment is that another of my disgusting fetishes is filled by most of the cast
[1:51:09] <jetjagger222> the shading of the models reminds me of fight of gods a bit

[1:51:18] <TigerClaws12> team "big chest only"
[1:51:23] <SpookyMooks> of course he picks the giantess duo LUL
[1:51:41] <Chorkly> well yes, Woolie makes nothing but the bravest choices.
[1:51:47] <%xemnahort> Is the roster finished because those uneven rows are messing with my ocd
[1:51:51] <+TopTieramisu> @floralkami sneakers aren't any better protection against self-chainsawfication
[1:52:04] <%JustToWatch> Woolie is nothing if not committed
[1:52:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:52:23] <+black_pariah> if thats not a placeholder grid, then the final roster will be huge
[1:52:24] <Applecannon63> Oh god 4v4
[1:52:26] <%yusefHD> SNK
[1:52:26] <%Struggleful> Woolie really enjoys his Kane and Undertaker team in this all female fighting game
[1:52:26] <floralkami> @toptieramisu something tells me she isn't that worried about self-care
[1:52:38] <RichochetForce> 17 YEARS LAYER
[1:52:40] <RichochetForce> LATER*
[1:52:43] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> Fuck yeah time for a sip
[1:52:50] <Chorkly> "fun" "interesting"
[1:52:56] <+TopTieramisu> holy crap
[1:52:59] <RichochetForce> Wow
[1:53:01] <Solidnick18> um
[1:53:02] <Chorkly> that's sick
[1:53:02] <+SvenHolgersson> "fun" YOU MEAN HOT
[1:53:04] <anarchistPastry> the amount of polys in her THIGHS ALONE
[1:53:04] <floralkami> .... I'm sorry??
[1:53:05] <%Struggleful> Crash incoming LUL
[1:53:07] <RichochetForce> Look at this fucking training stage
[1:53:10] <RichochetForce> LOOK AT IT
[1:53:11] <Afrosamasenpai> He has the same character on his team!
[1:53:11] <+TopTieramisu> the two girls with nice legs
[1:53:13] <Applecannon63> Holy fucking shit
[1:53:21] <%Juriasu> this stage is awesome
[1:53:38] <+TopTieramisu> this is like that tekken 7 stage
[1:53:39] <jetjagger222> this is like lili's stage in T5DR
[1:53:49] <enerkaizer> Some design have the Virtua fighter issue of beeing just "realistic" with noe real design spice added to it. Other however are real winners like the chainsaw girl or female Jack-6 because they stand out
[1:53:53] <jetjagger222> and yeah kinder gym in T7
[1:53:54] <+SiegmundCG> ngl the models look pretty 3d porn but the animation and designs are great
[1:53:55] <Super_Voltekka> This game would probably crash in 5 seconds if the 4v4 Dramatic Battle mod was installed
[1:53:57] <%Juriasu> the xxxx and the yyyy
[1:54:04] <%xemnahort> I’d hit her from the back
[1:54:11] <Chorkly> what's the horror fighting game they've played before
[1:54:14] <+jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[1:54:16] <Chorkly> getting real *that* vibes
[1:54:17] <+TopTieramisu> i love the kung fu shoulder tackle
[1:54:22] <RichochetForce> @emeraldskrull Yeah, you nailed it. Taekwondo girl is a good example of this. Just.. super dull.
[1:54:28] <jetjagger222> @Chorkly terrordrome?
[1:54:31] <+jiggy_snipe> the tag is very interesting
[1:54:33] <GengarUsedCut> @Chorkly death cargo?
[1:54:38] <+Chili_Daddy> This game makes FighterZ raw tag look ass LUL
[1:54:39] <Chorkly> @jetjagger222 Yes!
[1:54:48] <Chorkly> although Death Cargo is a fucking pull
[1:54:54] <GengarUsedCut> xD
[1:55:04] <+TopTieramisu> baek vs hwoarang feminized
[1:55:07] <+itsgundamu> oh shit MUGEN
[1:55:08] <jetjagger222> and there was that other one with the disgusting wound effects where the blood looked like burgers
[1:55:23] <floralkami> oh, that robot def has some tech to it
[1:55:33] <RichochetForce> @jetjagger222 Oh my god, that one was fucking hilarious
[1:55:51] <RichochetForce> @jetjagger222 The penguin character was incredible. Pillow Fight was the name, right?
[1:56:10] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:56:10] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:56:11] <+black_pariah> @WoolieVersus i'm noticing some slowdown in the animations, are you feeling that on the gameplay side?
[1:56:21] <+TopTieramisu> the music does bang tho
[1:56:22] <%xemnahort> When’s the return of thems fightin herds
[1:56:31] <datdemo> There's also a Karate chick and Ballerina in this game, are they not in this build?
[1:56:32] <+TopTieramisu> all the tracks have been pretty good
[1:56:40] <PhantomMaskJr> I wonder who’s stage this is HahaDoge
[1:57:07] <VirkaLlon> i don't think there has been a fighting gaem you can play 4 char in the same match?
[1:57:13] <%xemnahort> @datdemo they’ve gone through the entire visible roster so I’m guessing this is an earlier build
[1:57:18] <PhantomMaskJr> She got some nice leg muscle also
[1:57:34] <+TopTieramisu> earlier build? that's too bad
[1:57:38] <+TopTieramisu> i'd love to see more characters
[1:57:42] <enerkaizer> @VirkaLlon technically the Guilty Gear DS game has that. technically beeing important to note
[1:57:57] <%xemnahort> Maybe it’s just me but dao checks all the boxes for me
[1:58:06] <+jiggy_snipe> I like Dao too
[1:58:07] <floralkami> stance character?
[1:58:08] <%Struggleful> Fight Forever
[1:58:20] <+TopTieramisu> fem tam tam is my #1
[1:58:22] <Chorkly> I'm note seeing an ode to grapplers going on.
[1:58:26] <jetjagger222> @RichochetForce i took a look, its "the risers", the one right after pillow fight
[1:58:28] <+TopTieramisu> though 88 girl is pretty nice
[1:58:44] <RichochetForce> @jetjagger222 Oh, you're right
[1:58:57] <RichochetForce> Fear the Chainsaw
[1:59:15] <%drefizz> was that the Johnny Cage nut punch ?
[1:59:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[1:59:36] <VirkaLlon> @VirkaLlon damn, didn't know GG had a ds game, but yeah it should be more imo
[1:59:44] <chll0ne> dat butt Kreygasm
[1:59:59] <Skeletonmanners> just a hunch but devs of this game might be into thighs
[2:00:08] <jetjagger222> @Skeletonmanners and asians
[2:00:08] <Mibeador> yo what is this? Just joined
[2:00:18] <KineticZen> That giant muscular woman though
[2:00:23] <RichochetForce> @Skeletonmanners Yeah, the thigh game is STRONG in this
[2:00:26] <Chorkly> @jetjagger222 fallout frontier devs?
[2:00:29] <+TopTieramisu> game made in mugen
[2:00:35] <RichochetForce> Almost all of them have exposed thighs, and most of them are lovingly rendered
[2:00:35] <T_Sasquatch> since when was mugen 3d ?
[2:00:43] <RichochetForce> It's like a game made by Chun Li fans
[2:00:44] <TheactualDiepod> I mean this is neat and all but where is the transforming robot girl? When's Megatron?
[2:00:54] <chll0ne> @skeletonmanners only the most cultured of humanity are
[2:01:00] <+TopTieramisu> who is the one 2nd to bottom right?
[2:01:01] <%xemnahort> I just noticed the timer is not changing every second it’s much longer
[2:01:22] <enerkaizer> The Guilty Gear game on DS is kinda sorta a smash bros. style fighter using the old GG 2d sprites. It's hella jank and the characters also only have a very reduced number of their moves
[2:01:25] <+TopTieramisu> fighting game timers are deceptive
[2:01:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> AYAYA
[2:01:28] <RichochetForce> Wait, does Dollface have a goddamn Tamagotchi on her waist?
[2:01:48] <VirkaLlon> @VirkaLlon *more common
[2:02:20] <RichochetForce> Hatoful Boyfriend background? Sick
[2:02:22] <%yusefHD> 4v4 one hit contest?

[2:02:39] <+doc_savage> SNU SNU?
[2:02:40] <Applecannon63> Big woman~
[2:02:44] <+TopTieramisu> that's a very small school building
[2:02:57] <RichochetForce> @TopTieramisu That building isn't small, Tyra's just that big
[2:03:00] <enerkaizer> That character with the red mowhawk in the backround really tryieng to become a character in this game
[2:03:03] <floralkami> Dollface has an unironically really good, kinda scary design
[2:03:06] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @datdemo
[2:03:10] <Afrosamasenpai> oh no the menat slide
[2:03:12] <PhantomMaskJr> Bat gun

[2:03:59] <+TopTieramisu> so what's this girl's background? space cop?
[2:04:01] <%yusefHD> Twinkle riot headass
[2:04:04] <+HollowfiedOwl> pog
[2:04:09] <%xemnahort> Mr Mohawk is clearly the first boy to apply to this formerly all girls school
[2:04:10] <+TopTieramisu> judge dredd?
[2:04:10] <%LastHazzerd> i like this NOT-GoodBadUgly music
[2:04:19] <floralkami> don't be swayed by her boxing, she's still a cop #acab
[2:04:26] <jetjagger222> there's a single Y chromosome in the game and in this stage
[2:04:27] <RichochetForce> @yusefHD Damn, same person I had in mind too
[2:05:01] <+TopTieramisu> now that's an anti-air punish

[2:07:39] <floralkami> OOOOH, WE GOT COMBOS, BOIS
[2:07:39] <%xemnahort> I like how one girl in the back is like ‘Imma get so many views from this’
[2:07:47] <striderzer0> thank
[2:08:03] <PhantomMaskJr> This games ost is a must download for me larxaHappy
[2:08:14] <+TopTieramisu> all of these school girls are really airing out their legs
[2:08:31] <lycandruid> where can i place my votes / bets
[2:08:34] <%xemnahort> Oh nvm they’ve all got phones out but only one is smart enough to relax
[2:08:44] <RichochetForce> Still weirded out that actual Japanese girls hike up their skirts like that
[2:09:06] <Applecannon63> Ryu Ken team
[2:09:07] <+TopTieramisu> i'm more weirded out by why all of their legs are that open while standing casually
[2:09:14] <%BinaryFireball> ELGS
[2:09:15] <RichochetForce> lol
[2:09:17] <%BinaryFireball> LEGS
[2:09:28] <floralkami> @richochetforce I mean, having gone to a Catholic school for a time, it's not just a JP thing
[2:09:35] <+loukemia83> You can tell this game will have hype tournaments in the bathrooms of events
[2:09:38] <Super_Voltekka> Thousand-armed Guanyin in the background KomodoHype
[2:09:38] <Solidnick18> This is a sick stage
[2:09:42] <T_Sasquatch> Dad ? LUL
[2:09:46] <RichochetForce> Oh, really? Never went to a school where the uniform involved skirts for girls
[2:09:49] <+TopTieramisu> looks like a boss stage
[2:09:51] <%xemnahort> @loukemia83 I know I’ll be there
[2:09:53] <RichochetForce> So this shit is just the norm?
[2:10:04] <PhantomMaskJr> @lycandruid we only bet with souls here bronzeEVIL
[2:10:14] <T_Sasquatch> Skirts for girls uniorm is the norm
[2:10:24] <T_Sasquatch> uniform*
[2:10:39] <Applecannon63> sailor fuku uniform is like that
[2:10:43] <%xemnahort> Is that stance a dodge or counter because the blur makes me think that
[2:10:44] <+TopTieramisu> wait, how much life can the untagged character recover?
[2:10:57] <RichochetForce> It looks like some fort of setup or counter
[2:11:10] <RichochetForce> This sounds like a final boss stage
[2:11:11] <+TopTieramisu> the fact that the current character isn't named on the lifebar is weird
[2:11:15] <floralkami> @richochetforce well yeah, people will always find a way to make their basic, forced uniform look more appealing
[2:11:34] <%xemnahort> @toptieramisu agreed but I’m sure that’s in the works
[2:11:35] <+black_pariah> @TopTieramisu that was bothering me too
[2:12:00] <floralkami> @richochetforce and yes, the Catholic schoolgirl uniform is famous specifically because of the skirt
[2:12:35] <+loukemia83> @TopTieramisu The life bar in general should be larger, Maybe active character is the size of both lifebars combined now, and inactive character is the current size underneath
[2:12:36] <%xemnahort> @floralkami created to be modest, destined to be sinful
[2:13:08] <Applecannon63> fashion has always been fetish fuel
[2:13:09] <+jiggy_snipe> what was that?
[2:13:10] <RAH001> what was that
[2:13:11] <+black_pariah> new tech!?
[2:13:12] <enerkaizer> sudden command grap
[2:13:13] <Solidnick18> 👀
[2:13:14] <+SvenHolgersson> THE FUCK
[2:13:15] <RichochetForce> Yeah, the UI doe need a bunch of readability tweaks
[2:13:16] <+SvenHolgersson> DO IT AGAIN
[2:13:36] <Applecannon63> a grab counter?
[2:13:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:13:37] <%xemnahort> Fuck everytime I look away for even a second something sick happens
[2:13:42] <floralkami> @xemnahort tbf, skirts are kinda top tier for me regardless of the length, lol.
[2:13:42] <datdemo> that was a Kasui throw
[2:13:46] <RAH001> who foot prints are these?
[2:13:46] <T_Sasquatch> everyone : hands and feet , her : a pike!
[2:13:47] <datdemo> *Kasumi
[2:13:47] <goldenjogador> !MOTIVATED
[2:13:48] <@Moobot> 2032 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:13:58] <jetjagger222> oof that winpose is not great
[2:14:10] <%xemnahort> @floralkami for me it’s stockings that get me going
[2:14:37] <Applecannon63> absolute territory
[2:14:44] <floralkami> @applecannon63 I just wish more men would be open to more varied designs, instead of *box*
[2:14:48] <datdemo> pffft
[2:14:48] <meady32> vince mcmahon likes big sweaty women so I'm down
[2:15:05] <RichochetForce> @floralkami That'll happen as soon as society accepts it.
[2:15:07] <floralkami> @xemnahort close third after heels.
[2:15:55] <%yusefHD> YES IT IS
[2:15:56] <Pt_Kamen> is the ground pound a charge down - up
[2:15:59] <%xemnahort> Dao manages to hit 3 spots with makeshift stockings, partially bare feet and absolute territory
[2:16:04] <%fakeburg> Wait is this game running on Mugen?
[2:16:04] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! big ol legs

[2:16:31] <RichochetForce> Pyre hit me especially hard
[2:16:35] <nailwind> pizza feet
[2:16:36] <daddydagath> Bro she can crush my head between her thighs any time
[2:16:37] <RichochetForce> Out of nowhere
[2:17:10] <floralkami> @richochetforce bruh, society needs to realize the infinite potential for fanservice on ALL sides if we just gave dudes more girl curves in our clothes
[2:17:27] <%xemnahort> xemnahort subscribed at Tier 1.
[2:17:34] <RichochetForce> You can do it with properly fitted clothes and a tailor
[2:17:37] <RichochetForce> But that is precy
[2:17:38] <jetjagger222> @floralkami NOOOOO all dorito all the time
[2:17:42] <RichochetForce> pricey*
[2:17:57] <RichochetForce> Yeah, the perspective on this is weird
[2:18:07] <%LastHazzerd> looks like a stage play
[2:18:13] <%CalderGaming> ACAB
[2:18:15] <floralkami> @richochetforce my next paycheck is going to my first sewing machine for that reason >:)
[2:18:18] <+black_pariah> ui just got a whole lot better
[2:18:20] <%LastHazzerd> the floor should probs be tilted down further?
[2:18:26] <+loukemia83> oh we got dempsey rolls
[2:18:35] <daddydagath> Coming at her like "stop resisting"
[2:18:37] <RAH001> shes a cop?
[2:18:39] <jetjagger222> i really like the green sole on the blue/white uniform
[2:18:41] <T_Sasquatch> cammy looking ass
[2:18:46] <RichochetForce> @LastHazzerd Yes. We should not be seeing the background's floor from this angle
[2:18:57] <RichochetForce> It's some M.C. Escher weirdness going on
[2:19:11] <floralkami> @jetjagger222 you can have Dorito and make it sexy, lol. fat appreciation happens on both sides if we fight for it.
[2:19:19] <%xemnahort> @richochetforce yeah I think that would all that’s needed to fix this
[2:19:53] <floralkami> @richochetforce eh? most fighting game stages have that perspective, tho.
[2:20:02] <RAH001> i feel like aya use to have a helmet
[2:20:06] <RichochetForce> Eh, not like this
[2:20:18] <RichochetForce> This is very obviously wrong. Look at SF5 or KOF XIV
[2:20:34] <RichochetForce> It's a flatter, more natural look at the background
[2:20:34] <jetjagger222> it looks like engine limitations making the perspective wonky
[2:20:39] <RichochetForce> ^
[2:20:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:20:41] <jetjagger222> it needs to be cheated somehow
[2:20:49] <daddydagath> Yeah this looks way too long for how they're standing
[2:20:51] <TigerClaws12> wait is that hitman stance? LUL
[2:20:54] <Iwashi94> god that hissing sounds like it's one of the guys doing it lol
[2:21:01] <+TopTieramisu> looked like wind god hook fist
[2:21:31] <floralkami> @richochetforce I think I see what you mean, more with the bottom of the windows barely leaving the ground

[2:21:56] <RichochetForce> @jetjagger222 And with that comment sadness returns to my heart
[2:22:06] <+TopTieramisu> THAWK
[2:22:11] <bevyrage> T-HAWK
[2:22:14] <RichochetForce> At least we got characters
[2:22:22] <enerkaizer> so she is part jack 6 and part T-Hawk
[2:22:26] <Skeletonmanners> god this girl is so big and oiled up and mamma mia
[2:22:26] <datdemo> Whoa never seen that move
[2:22:28] <Solidnick18> CONDOR DIVE
[2:22:29] <jetjagger222> @RichochetForce by far that was the most disappointing part of SC6 for me, considering how awesome SC2/3 stages were
[2:22:38] <bevyrage> she also has the galactica phantom windup punch
[2:22:51] <Kristoffers> lol
[2:22:51] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:22:56] <daddydagath> Large amazon mommy always wins
[2:22:57] <+TopTieramisu> imagine if that did big chip damage
[2:22:59] <jetjagger222> SC4 too with the ostreinsburg stage with the knights
[2:22:59] <+waltzqueen> Stop That
[2:23:02] <MichaelOfCainhurst> LUL
[2:23:04] <BlackermanZX> the fear LUL
[2:23:04] <RichochetForce> @jetjagger222 Yeah, the wide variety of stage sizes, shapes, themes, and alternate modes really made those games great to play
[2:23:06] <datdemo> WHAT
[2:23:07] <+TopTieramisu> RESTAND
[2:23:10] <Afrosamasenpai> SIR

[2:23:20] <Kristoffers> woolie's ideal woman right here
[2:23:29] <$arcielardor> I do like these character designs
[2:23:31] <daddydagath> Literally yells out DIE when she swings
[2:23:32] <datdemo> If she wasn't goign to be my main already
[2:23:34] <bevyrage> doesn't punch mom have hair sorta like this too?
[2:23:37] <+black_pariah> no stance, just menacing
[2:23:46] <Kristoffers> *menacing*
[2:23:52] <RichochetForce> @bevyrage Punchmom's true form
[2:23:58] <+loukemia83> ohhhh no not that animation
[2:24:10] <%RazingPhoenix> These dashes are pretty cool. Charactesr are just shmooving across the screen.
[2:24:16] <+TopTieramisu> is that boxer's anti-air?
[2:24:16] <+SvenHolgersson> GOD I WISH THAT WERE ME
[2:24:28] <+TopTieramisu> or i guess like mika's
[2:24:33] <$arcielardor> hey Woolie, any timeline on the new ep release of your Guilty Gear series?
[2:24:37] <Afrosamasenpai> Definitely Mika's
[2:24:40] <jetjagger222> fucking t hawk
[2:24:40] <RichochetForce> Yeah, that was Mika's headbutt
[2:24:45] <+black_pariah> oh bad perspective on this one
[2:24:47] <OzdotTV> God this soundtrack Kreygasm
[2:24:53] <+TopTieramisu> the scale is awful LUL
[2:24:55] <+TopTieramisu> look at the shadows
[2:24:56] <daddydagath> Jesus christ how horrifying
[2:24:59] <bevyrage> yeah the paralax on this one is not good
[2:25:03] <Afrosamasenpai> She even has Mika's slide!
[2:25:03] <VirkaLlon> Dat pressure
[2:25:05] <Afrosamasenpai> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:25:08] <%zacyzacy> are these sprites?
[2:25:11] <jetjagger222> UWOH
[2:25:16] <RichochetForce> The lines on this stage are really exacerbating the perspective issue
[2:25:22] <floralkami> okay, yeah that perspective is hella fucked. the ceiling is what gets me.
[2:25:33] <+TopTieramisu> where the hell is the light source
[2:25:38] <RichochetForce> The door in the background is actually murdering me
[2:25:38] <+TopTieramisu> it's like there's no roof in this room
[2:25:42] <floralkami> the room feels cramped
[2:25:47] <bevyrage> the light source is above the left wall
[2:25:48] <$arcielardor> reminds of that one room in the old Willy Wonka movie
[2:25:51] <bevyrage> but also behind the back wall
[2:25:56] <Afrosamasenpai> never stop headbutting
[2:25:58] <%CalderGaming> what was that whiff?
[2:26:04] <VirkaLlon> Ms. Shakedown
[2:26:05] <TheactualDiepod> So she's every big character
[2:26:05] <daddydagath> The ceilings just void
[2:26:06] <+loukemia83> Whats a hitbox though?
[2:26:09] <T_Sasquatch> that is a 2dass room LUL
[2:26:18] <MichaelOfCainhurst> BIG VS BIG

[2:28:17] <+TopTieramisu> this stage could use some work
[2:28:22] <bevyrage> oh hey defensive posture is a proper MMA name
[2:28:25] <RichochetForce> Blatantly unfinished
[2:28:29] <Estuko> reminds me, I need to see if Kengan Omega is updated.
[2:28:32] <RichochetForce> It's got that pure black SMB1 look
[2:28:40] <RichochetForce> Mario Bros*
[2:28:41] <jetjagger222> @Estuko yes last wed/thu
[2:28:46] <Estuko> Thank you!!!
[2:28:47] <floralkami> damn, these a lotta moves
[2:29:03] <+waltzqueen> AlleyYoop
[2:29:11] <+TopTieramisu> i'm impressed by its movelist, even if a lot of them are borrowed
[2:29:24] <+TopTieramisu> don't really see a lot of indie fgs with such a wide list
[2:29:32] <Applecannon63> its Tekken movelist
[2:29:35] <jetjagger222> the keyframes are really good too, which is a problem with a lot of indie fighters
[2:29:38] <+TopTieramisu> and some sf ones
[2:29:56] <jetjagger222> and not-so-indie like NRS titles LUL
[2:29:58] <bevyrage> i legit do not like any fighting game that allows you to block grabs
[2:30:07] <bevyrage> but this one is making a good case for it
[2:30:08] <jetjagger222> @bevyrage weaponlord
[2:30:20] <+TopTieramisu> a grab that can be blocked isn't a real grab
[2:30:27] <yaboirayden> hit grba
[2:30:29] <jetjagger222> yup weaponlord grabs are more attack throws
[2:30:31] <yaboirayden> grab*
[2:30:37] <%CalderGaming> @bevyrage I just think of it as flavoring for a regular hit
[2:31:03] <+TopTieramisu> alex's headbutt pseudograb
[2:31:03] <+SvenHolgersson> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:31:03] <%LordSDB> NICE FUCKING NICE MATCH!
[2:31:07] <yaboirayden> wtf, is she just alex?
[2:31:08] <bevyrage> i blame MK for having command grabs that you can just block in X and onward
[2:31:09] <Applecannon63> oh fod a chokeslam
[2:31:14] <+SvenHolgersson> Alex wishes he was this good
[2:31:20] <+TopTieramisu> @yaboirayden sadly she doesn't seem to have TWO BOOTS
[2:31:24] <%JustToWatch> 1 more fr fr
[2:31:25] <yaboirayden> but do she have stomps tho
[2:31:25] <%xemnahort> Soul caliber attack throws are also blockagle
[2:31:27] <+TopTieramisu> alex's best move
[2:31:29] <jetjagger222> @SvenHolgersson ouch, i felt that because i mained alex in season 3 lol
[2:31:30] <RichochetForce> Tyra is better than any iteration of Alex, easily
[2:31:32] <%xemnahort> *blockable
[2:31:53] <Afrosamasenpai> Was not expecting a TJPW shoutout.
[2:31:56] <bevyrage> soul caliber's are techable
[2:32:00] <RAH001> more big girls in fighting games goddammit
[2:32:01] <+TopTieramisu> she has vice's tackle
[2:32:04] <%LastHazzerd> this clash of titans
[2:32:07] <+breakersnap> this music has no right being so good
[2:32:25] <+TopTieramisu> wtf
[2:32:28] <Estuko> you can imagine that the arena would be constantly quaking
[2:32:29] <@Menitta> WHAT
[2:32:31] <floralkami> @richochetforce not me suddenly crying in the club, no sir :)
[2:32:31] <alphaprotoshow> WOW! She used Thawks move!
[2:32:44] <+TopTieramisu> her crouch animation is great too
[2:32:46] <RichochetForce> Another THawk move
[2:32:57] <floralkami> @rah001 *SLAMMING BUTTON*
[2:33:03] <jetjagger222> well, she's better than both hawk and alex
[2:33:19] <RichochetForce> Capcom or SNK should just shamelessly rip this off
[2:33:20] <+TopTieramisu> can't say she's better than vice though
[2:33:29] <RichochetForce> This is a strong combination of Alex and THawk
[2:33:45] <Paftdunk2> what is this
[2:33:46] <%xemnahort> For years we believed the t in t hawk stood for thunder but now we know it’s actually for tyra
[2:33:51] <jetjagger222> this is kinda like girl fight except the people knew how to make a fighting game
