[0:03:28] <%Wool> @rupy100 what an opinion
[0:03:38] <%scrumbotime> God Nioh and Nioh 2's crafting was BS and I couldn't stand it
[0:03:41] <%Asuterisuku> Especially when the Slayer's mobility was so good in Eternal.
[0:03:44] <Spydurman> @Asuterisuku the platforming made me so mad I couldn't enjoy the game. Really wanted to though
[0:03:54] <Spydurman> I'm also trash at platforming
[0:03:57] <Viewtiful_Rose> Minecraft has the best crafting cuz it’s mad simple

[0:06:34] <BlackermanZX> theres a lot of low lvl bgs in wow
[0:06:45] <%Asuterisuku> Grinding for grinding's sake is always a major turnoff. It's why I can't get into Monster Hunter.
[0:06:47] <nothuzad> guild wars is still one of the best pvp mmos
[0:06:50] <2017y> low level struggle brackets are the most woolieFUN
[0:07:00] <TheA1ternative> Rip Reggie missed out on being addicted to crack
[0:07:03] <%Bluwizard21> Guild wars 1 was so good
[0:07:18] <2017y> bizarre shit where rogues are better then druids before the level range when druids get everyone else's tools
[0:07:22] <jimmytwofeet> you got dat WMD? 20 bucks a pop
[0:07:26] <%YakumoYomi> DCUO was alright, in that regard: the "story" stuff from level 1 to 30 was fun. But after that, you had to start diving into the multiple currencies nonsense.
