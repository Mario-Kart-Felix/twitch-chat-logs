[0:09:27] <%Dakuu75> So how many planets has Samus blown up? (Is it MORE than Vegeta?)
[0:09:33] <+TestAnon> that's just swamp gas
[0:09:33] <+LazyAss24Seven> UNIVERSE-STAR
[0:09:36] <+add0607> Thank God someone posted the X on TikTok
[0:09:36] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus They way they had to surgically remove some of the parts of her suit...she's gotta be a WRECK under that suit, no?
[0:09:39] <+PA_august> That‚Äôs a photoshop you can tell from the pixels

[0:09:42] <+JustToWatch> they saw X in the background of a TikTok vid
[0:09:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> Oh
[0:09:46] <LBC921> the last x is not in captivity. The galaxy is freaking out
[0:09:51] <Asuterisuku> @dakuu75 Three.
[0:09:51] <%ToomaKH7> my siblings always asked why horror movies didn't scare me. I'd look them in the eyes and say "A horror movie can't track me down through SR388..."
[0:09:53] <Calek> X: I lived bitch
[0:09:55] <ediblemold> You'd think there would be galactic laws against casually blowing habitable planets up.
[0:10:01] <Dat_Abaddon> Yeah...no
[0:10:02] <pepinillomaton> What can go wrong right?
[0:10:06] <tsunderecactus0> Just 2 planets, I think? Zebes and SR-388?
[0:10:11] <redwidow1358> The last X is not in captivity. The galaxy is at the exact opposite of peace.
[0:10:15] <tsunderecactus0> Is there a third planet I'm forgetting about
[0:10:16] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! here's to the return of Metroid (and the wait for more prime 4 news), keep on keeping on, Woolie!
[0:10:18] <+megaman_sentinel> hea she known for her planet count
[0:10:18] <+add0607> the strongest stuff in the universe. you know, like metal
[0:10:20] <$brave_sj> Leaving delicate operations to drones has NEVER gone wrong
[0:10:22] <hollumdusk> @Dakuu75 Zebes, SR388, Dark Aether and Phazon
[0:10:23] <Dat_Abaddon> welp
[0:10:24] <+itsgundamu> They ain't scared of nothin
[0:10:24] <$NitronStreams> Never send a robot to do a Bounty Hunter's job
[0:10:25] <Asuterisuku> @tsunderecactus0 Also Phaase
[0:10:26] <+IvadHod> LUL
[0:10:26] <+LazyAss24Seven> dun Dun DUN, call Samus!
[0:10:30] <drunken_lemur> But something went horribly wrong
[0:10:31] <%MegadBlitz> these robots extract DNA by murking you IMMEDIATELY
[0:10:34] <+alphonseisbest> YOU HAD OE JOB ROBOTS
[0:10:36] <tsunderecactus0> Ah, if you count Prime then there's more
[0:10:37] <pepinillomaton> Sick new costume tho
[0:10:38] <+alphonseisbest> ONE JOB
[0:10:39] <Wahrow> Samus is Sakurai confirmed
[0:10:39] <redwidow1358> Can't have shit on ZDR
[0:10:41] <Ethel9727> "Okay Samus you can rest."  Five minutes later. "Okay Samus we need you."
[0:10:43] <DXLelouch24> @ediblemold nah the X ARE A PROBLEM, BY any MEANS NECESSARY
[0:10:44] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[0:10:45] <%Akizea> this new suit is fuckin fire tho
[0:10:48] <%LastHazzerd> wonder how long the time gap between fusion and this is
[0:10:49] <DXLelouch24> BLOW IT UP
[0:10:53] <%RyuuAoi> Remember Fusion? Yeah. YOU FUCKED UP. Mission (NOT) complete.
[0:10:53] <OldManDeckardCain> Samus: "I'm getting too old for this..."
[0:10:54] <%Dakuu75> "we shoulda saved some time and just sent Samus right away."
[0:10:55] <+LazyAss24Seven> 1 job dammit nliAhhh
[0:10:55] <tsunderecactus0> In the 2D series it's just been 2 planets
[0:10:56] <+alphonseisbest> YUP YUP
[0:10:59] <emper0rner0> BECAUSE SHE'S COOL
[0:11:00] <+IvadHod> "Samus, we fucked up again! Help pls!"
[0:11:03] <slidshockingkrow> these robots are manufactured by "exilion star corporation", why is the galactic federation fobbing off these missions on private firms and bounty hunters? plausible deniability?
[0:11:05] <pepinillomaton> Just nuke it at this point
[0:11:06] <+s0ki_> been love this game so far
[0:11:09] <ediblemold> Samus and team Star Fox share that problem.
[0:11:10] <+CalderGaming> but the federation force tho :)
[0:11:11] <+StrawberryPantsu> "Hey,Samus... We know we kinda want you dead and all cause of the whole BSL thing,but like we kinda need you on this one..."
[0:11:16] <%MegadBlitz> what happened to the other bounty hunters? where are they??
[0:11:17] <+thelovingfool> samus is just a one woman army
[0:11:19] <+LazyAss24Seven> that zoom
[0:11:21] <@Solidus_113> 30fps locked cutscenes, pain
[0:11:22] <+cermo55> The ultimate tactical Nuke: the protagonist
[0:11:25] <%brisk_dacat> samus rates must be outstanding
[0:11:26] <+DatAsuna> what galaxy? The world only exists within samus' vicinity
[0:11:26] <redwidow1358> "Nah we can do it, we're big strong military men, nothing will go wrong."
[0:11:34] <drunken_lemur> ADAM?

[0:11:45] <glaciusinfinite> why did they think sending robots will work after BOX from fusion?
[0:11:46] <%MegadBlitz> yeeeaaahh ADAM
[0:11:46] <+Slattsquatch> @tsunderecactus0 Mind you, those two planets were either directly or indirectly the setting of the first 4 games so she basically has a 100% success rate
[0:11:48] <Jrocy247> Woolie flying solo today
[0:11:48] <Asuterisuku> Adam senses it's SUS

[0:12:10] <slidshockingkrow> what does samus even spend her bounties on? Does she have hobbies?
[0:12:11] <+JustToWatch> Imagine being the guy who was all like "Guys we don't need Samus this time we got these fucking beast ass robots"
[0:12:12] <+TheFrancix> sassy AI?
[0:12:13] <tsunderecactus0> @slattsquatch Samus is nothing if not efficient
[0:12:13] <%Prevot> it's just the same from Fusion
[0:12:15] <+DatAsuna> I like the screw attack symbols on her shoulder
[0:12:15] <+Superspider51> it's the same ship from fusion
[0:12:16] <pepinillomaton> Yamcha pose!
[0:12:17] <%TheLemuroid> YAMCHA NOOOOO

[0:12:19] <%NovaKnightmare> Adam AI > actual Adam
[0:12:19] <SunsetJack> Remember, the old ship crashed in Fusion.
[0:12:20] <Darren716> Fusion has a good ship design, second to the Prime 3 design
[0:12:22] <drunken_lemur> What happened!?
[0:12:22] <redwidow1358> Yamaha
[0:12:22] <%ToomaKH7> what a Tool
[0:12:23] <+cermo55> frame 1
[0:12:24] <%blastyoboots> blastyoboots subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Yamcha'd
[0:12:25] <ediblemold> Poor Adam is way more based as an AI than a meatbag

[0:12:31] <UrsaDoom> the old ship looked like her helmet
[0:12:31] <+alphonseisbest> BUG
[0:12:36] <+BedHome> the "yamcha pose" is just how people lay down

[0:12:43] <%Pachi3000> wha happun

[0:12:54] <$NitronStreams> Its been 5 minute and Samus already got her shit rocked
[0:12:59] <kapitankolin> AI Adam calling her lady sounds a lot more like familial and playful as opposed to Fleshbag Adam doing a super misogyny tbh
[0:12:59] <Darren716> The gold red and white is so clean
[0:13:00] <pepinillomaton> Oh man this 5g sucks!

[0:15:06] <%brisk_dacat> did he change her
[0:15:06] <%kyh9> The animation work on Samus is incredible in this game
[0:15:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Beat this yesterday. Its liquid fire. Hope u enjoy
[0:15:10] <Estuko> Can you feel the Metroid Dread‚Ñ¢ ?
[0:15:10] <%LastHazzerd> this game is beautiful
[0:15:10] <Darren716> You need the stcik for aiming
[0:15:13] <LBC921> that reminds me of doom eternal heaven
[0:15:15] <tsunderecactus0> The Dread version of the Fusion suit is so drippy though
[0:15:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> Kinda got a Warframe feel
[0:15:20] <+LazyAss24Seven> its so smooth, its great!
[0:15:20] <emMmDeeKay> HypeSquawk PowerUpL
[0:15:22] <SunsetJack> Analog is required yee
[0:15:26] <%sleepy_coffee> Dang bird stole your veria suit
[0:15:29] <StarMechV> sO ANYWAYS i STARTED BLASTING
[0:15:30] <$brave_sj> So now I guess the Chozo are just showing up saying "You know the rules Samus, earn your gear back bit by bit"
[0:15:33] <sirthomas2step> good fire rate
[0:15:36] <ediblemold> I've really liked how smooth the movement in Dread is.
[0:15:37] <Saltmeisterr> u can REALLYmash that
[0:15:38] <SunsetJack> She fast.
[0:15:41] <GenkoForrest> wish the game had remappable controls for some of the button tho.
[0:15:45] <fluffyesttail> Ladies and gentlemen! It's the WOOLIE VERSUS SHOOOW!
[0:15:46] <Riettler> Can't have jack on RDX
[0:15:48] <+thelovingfool> the slide feels so good
[0:15:49] <%RyuuAoi> She's light
[0:15:50] <double_zr_tap> slide and melee
[0:15:52] <Jrocy247> She moves fast compared to the other games
[0:15:56] <Rostichenburg> They make Samus run so fast in this one
[0:15:59] <GenkoForrest> that was the one problem I had with Samus Returns that they didn't rectify.
[0:16:07] <+Slattsquatch> The schmovement in this game is so good
[0:16:08] <%ToomaKH7> BUT WOOLIE WE DID THAT WITH A D PAD IN SUPER METROID, ZERO MISSON, FUSION-
[0:16:15] <+BedHome> i wish metroid would more often just let you keep your tech but make it less usefull in the new setting so you needed new tech
[0:16:15] <hollumdusk> Oh, the controls in this game are great. And Samus is a joy to control now!
[0:16:21] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Encountered "the coolest guy you've ever seen"
[0:16:22] <Qsmash_> the map is so comprehensive. It's a life saver.
[0:16:22] <+JustToWatch> Events: I got my shit WRECKED
[0:16:23] <Shade075> I like that Samus got some good hits in on Birdgil and wasnt just a total stomp
[0:16:23] <Estuko> is Metroid Fusion on switch too?
[0:16:23] <GenkoForrest> but we at least have the system level switch remappings to use.
[0:16:27] <guiltyboya> Chozo be looking like a Goa'uld from Stargate
[0:16:34] <%ToomaKH7> @Estuko GBA
[0:16:35] <AppleBerryKitty> Is woolie cold or something?
[0:16:36] <Asuterisuku> This is the single most mobile Samus has EVER been and it feels great.
[0:16:36] <pepinillomaton> Lemon shooter!
[0:16:42] <emper0rner0> Should I go back and finish Samus Returns before I get this game?
[0:16:42] <%ToomaKH7> NEver ported sadly
[0:16:45] <UrsaDoom> But birds aren't real
[0:16:49] <Estuko> @Estuko whew
[0:16:50] <pet_purple_panda> I get the lament of loss of DPAD but the game styill feels god
[0:16:57] <redwidow1358> @emper0rner0 I would recommend it
[0:16:58] <Qsmash_> Fusion is on the Wii U but not Switch
[0:17:05] <%RyuuAoi> @emper0rner0 Honestly just play Fusion
[0:17:11] <%ToomaKH7> oh i guess its on the wii u
[0:17:11] <redwidow1358> Not required but it helps to get used to some of MercurySteam's tendencies
[0:17:12] <Rostichenburg> @emper0rner0 It's not super required but this game builds on the mechanics of that one
[0:17:14] <%ToomaKH7> i never owned a wii u lol
[0:17:15] <lonosis47> Did woolie stop the smt playthrough??
[0:17:17] <hollumdusk> Almost the entire franchise is available on Wii U, weirdly enough
[0:17:22] <%TheLemuroid> Missiles are practically free btw
[0:17:24] <+CalderGaming> you don't need a run-up for slide either
[0:17:28] <Rostichenburg> It's much more important to play Metroid Fusion
[0:17:34] <+pupil31> SUNDAY STREAM Poggers
[0:17:39] <Estuko> LUL I still have my Wiiu I better go dust em off
[0:17:46] <lonosis47> Also how come no reggie
[0:17:54] <SunsetJack> The game doesn't explain the wall jump but it is easy to figure out.
[0:17:59] <Saltmeisterr> theres also wall jumping
[0:18:00] <%ToomaKH7> Well hey, anything to get the Wii U sales
[0:18:02] <%RyuuAoi> This seems like this takes place like immediately right after Fusion.
[0:18:06] <pet_purple_panda> @lonosis47 metroid is a lonely game by its nature
[0:18:09] <DXLelouch24> best map ever imo
[0:18:11] <fluffyesttail> I'm so glad power grip isn't an upgrade in this
[0:18:14] <Jrocy247> Toggle would've been helpful
[0:18:19] <pet_purple_panda> also surprise stream
[0:18:19] <%ToomaKH7> its like when people pointed out Skyward sword was 20 bucks on the wii u, yeah bc the console sold terribly
[0:18:21] <+alphonseisbest> same
[0:18:24] <+thelovingfool> i beat the game and im still not used to anything on the shoulders
[0:18:27] <+DatAsuna> Nintendo gave up their high ground by not being consistent with themselves
[0:18:27] <+cavefishes> RB / RT always fucks me up
[0:18:28] <hollumdusk> Wii U has Metroid 1, Zero Mission, Super Metroid, Fusion, the Prime Trilogy, Hunters and Other M.
[0:18:29] <Rostichenburg> I'll never remember which one is L and which is ZL
[0:18:32] <pepinillomaton> What even is a wall
[0:18:33] <+alphonseisbest> ZL  ZR is lame

[0:18:57] <BurdRightsActivist> AUTHORIZATION.
[0:18:57] <%kyh9> I always liked Trigger and Bumper more
[0:19:00] <pet_purple_panda> controls should be universal period
[0:19:03] <kapitankolin> SMT nocturne disco ball
[0:19:03] <%Prevot> ZL and ZR still better than LT and RT
[0:19:06] <%LastHazzerd> has Dual Shock trademarked the terms?
[0:19:08] <Rostichenburg> Trigger is fine Bumper is stupid
[0:19:10] <dukenux> MrDestructoid
[0:19:11] <Asuterisuku> I like the Xbox terminology.
[0:19:12] <Darren716> You got wrecked
[0:19:12] <+DatAsuna> PS and Xbox have had consistent button layouts whereas nintendo didn't use the same layout once from the NES till the 3DS
[0:19:18] <%RyuuAoi> What a fucking asshole Adam is.
[0:19:18] <guiltyboya> "You are a mess, lady"

[0:19:22] <+DatAsuna> *SNES
[0:19:26] <redwidow1358> I don't like calling them bumpers, but I call them "the left and right buttons" which distinguishes them from left and right "on the D-pad"

[0:19:36] <dukenux> Adam STILL dead PeepoHappy
[0:19:36] <%ToomaKH7> I thought they literally put adam in the computer?
[0:19:38] <$Lunaar> I always heard Adam in my head was something like VEGA from Doom 2016
[0:19:40] <$Lunaar> but I still like it
[0:19:41] <Chichen> BIRDGIL
[0:19:44] <StarMechV> BIRDGIL
[0:19:46] <%LastHazzerd> wake up samus, you fucked up big time!
[0:19:46] <pepinillomaton> BIRD UP
[0:19:47] <+s0ki_> you can  set custom binds for controller but its a global override in the switches system settings.
[0:19:51] <+DatAsuna> shut up about vergil
[0:19:52] <Yakobro> not agaiiiin
[0:19:53] <zanzibarian_hamster> Did other M retroactively ruin the "lady" thing or was it always bad?
[0:19:54] <%ToomaKH7> didnt they say in fusion he was the actual mind of Adam? Am I wrong?

[0:19:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Adam was always a brain upload in Fusion
[0:20:00] <%kyh9> BERDLY HAS ENTERED THE GAME
[0:20:01] <$NitronStreams> Reading indicate you got your SHIT KICKED IN
[0:20:02] <%mr_sups> "NOOOO My Powerups!"
[0:20:04] <+cermo55> yup
[0:20:07] <dukenux> Samus' brain is full of holes
[0:20:07] <Jrocy247> YOU GOT YOUR ASS BEAT
[0:20:08] <%LastHazzerd> it's like a medical condition at this point
[0:20:08] <ediblemold> When I get beat up I also lose consciousness and wake up with less clothes on.
[0:20:08] <+pupil31> Physical amnesia
[0:20:10] <Rostichenburg> The concept art for these rooms had a giant digital face instead
[0:20:13] <%Sparkseid> Samus you got bodied into physical amnesia
[0:20:14] <+JohnMcClane6194> Fusion's reason was good to
[0:20:14] <%kyh9> Berdly has stolen your powers, Kris
[0:20:16] <SunsetJack> Did she lose them in Prime 3?
[0:20:17] <%Prevot> bird magic
[0:20:18] <%RyuuAoi> A bird like FUCKED YOU UP
[0:20:19] <drunken_lemur> I think that Fusion still did it better.
[0:20:20] <Yerochan> down the drain
[0:20:22] <BurdRightsActivist> Fusion too!
[0:20:22] <+thelovingfool> prime was the worst offender
[0:20:28] <ashenchevalierthesecond> The one in Prime 1 where she just gets knocked into a wall was hilarious
[0:20:28] <dukenux> Chorizo
[0:20:30] <marumariball> a cholo
[0:20:32] <+s0ki_> Birdgil
[0:20:32] <Asuterisuku> @sunsetjack She did not.
[0:20:33] <AzureSynesthesia> chozo lets go
[0:20:33] <UrsaDoom> before Super Metroid she sold her upgrades to buy Funk Pops
[0:20:34] <Calek> @SunsetJack she did, Phazon poisoning I believe
[0:20:39] <theblackbreath> prime 2's reason was fine
[0:20:41] <Yakobro> chodo
[0:20:45] <%RyuuAoi> @burdrightsactivist Fusion reasoning was good too!
[0:20:45] <pet_purple_panda> yo that bird took my shit
[0:20:51] <%probably_facetious> GOW 2 and 3 had good reasoning for power reset, too
[0:20:53] <SunsetJack> I got conflicted answers.
[0:20:55] <%Juriasu> that's racist
[0:20:58] <dukenux> "Bird up"
[0:20:59] <%Pachi3000> "Your top priority should be to get the fuck out"
[0:21:00] <%Dakuu75> omg, the mission is "Dig up, stupid."
[0:21:00] <BurdRightsActivist> that's racist
[0:21:01] <$Lunaar> doodHokey
[0:21:04] <Darren716> I always liked Prime 3 where they just let you keep half your shit at the start of the game
[0:21:05] <guiltyboya> "Local Chozo litterally too angry to die"
[0:21:05] <glaciusinfinite> well fusion you had all you power surgically removed so you could survive the goop
[0:21:07] <%MechArch> cacaw lookin ass
[0:21:08] <+CammerTime21> "Kaw" "Dude thats racist"
[0:21:09] <%HollowedIdjit> aw man I missed the Big Bird
[0:21:11] <Blank9> prime's "oops explosion"  one was  the worst
[0:21:13] <i_love_thicc_chicks> Prime 2 made the most sense. Samus literally got ganged on and got her shit taken.
[0:21:13] <Rostichenburg> Metroid 2 Dig Down. Metroid 5 Dig Up
[0:21:14] <+CalderGaming> TUUUUUUUUBES
[0:21:15] <dukenux> Chocobo
[0:21:15] <drunken_lemur> Tubes!
[0:21:17] <StarMechV> TUUUUUUBES
[0:21:18] <$NitronStreams> LUL
[0:21:27] <hollumdusk> She should know, she was raised by  them!
[0:21:30] <%BackwardCap> Weird for a robot AI telling someone to "trust your instincts" gildedDerp
[0:21:31] <+D00msDayDan> TUUUBES
[0:21:32] <Shade075> Tubes are a universal constant in the metroidverse just look at the space pirates
[0:21:32] <Hyphen_Sum> It's Tubesday innit?
[0:21:33] <Jrocy247> She can finally ask "Why can't Metroid Crawl?"
[0:21:33] <+cermo55> The tubes are for morph ball travel
[0:21:35] <+WubGhost> tubes and balls Kappa
[0:21:36] <StarMechV> @WoolieVersus I thought it was the Space Pirates who were obsessed with Tubes tho
[0:21:38] <slidshockingkrow> if you could roll into a ball at will, you'd get everywhere by tube too
[0:21:42] <sirthomas2step> "Kaw kaw!" "That was beautiful. what was that, Tennyson?"
[0:21:47] <dadeaner> So now you can call her "Metroid" and be correct
[0:21:51] <guiltyboya> Ask your mom, ask DNA
[0:21:52] <Rostichenburg> @StarMechV Zebes was a Chozo colony first
[0:21:56] <Jrocy247> YES
[0:21:59] <+faeron93> Game reminding you about your shit.
[0:22:02] <dukenux> good
[0:22:07] <%RyuuAoi> Isn't the Metroid DNA literally the only reason why she is alive?
[0:22:07] <Asuterisuku> Always.
[0:22:07] <hollumdusk> @dadeaner Metroid means Ultimate Warrior, it was always correct!
[0:22:08] <%LastHazzerd> almost like planets are bio-diverse, eh?
[0:22:09] <+alphonseisbest> yup LUL
[0:22:10] <dukenux> SW planets dont make sense
[0:22:13] <Rostichenburg> Prime 3 had Star Wars planets
[0:22:14] <+SilverDevilfish> Samus has secure the Kolto supply Kappa
[0:22:19] <+megaman_sentinel> that power Stance tho
[0:22:20] <%Afterman_> oh shit!
[0:22:20] <+SilverDevilfish> ^has to
[0:22:23] <fluffyesttail> Ameebo:)
[0:22:24] <+theDesender> LUL
[0:22:26] <ediblemold> oh shit I forgot this even had amiibo support
[0:22:27] <+DatAsuna> @dukenux THere's actually a ton of single biome planets IRL tho
[0:22:27] <%RyuuAoi> SHOW THEM
[0:22:28] <@Solidus_113> easy modes
[0:22:30] <TigerClaws12> this some mobage shit LUL
[0:22:32] <%MegadBlitz> biodiversity is key to some sick level design

[0:22:42] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:22:45] <slidshockingkrow> that's her full name, Samus Metroid
[0:22:46] <%Dakuu75> amiibo privileges lol
[0:22:46] <Hyphen_Sum> Scan Amiibo to unlock the Vampire Killer
[0:22:46] <%kyh9> It's like if Sony was still trying to push Playstation Home
[0:22:58] <SunsetJack> Amiibo, the physical DLC.
[0:23:03] <+CalderGaming> @Hyphen_Sum okay but what if tho
[0:23:05] <Rostichenburg> Disappointed you can't use the Samus Returns Amiibo to get the fusion suit in this one too
[0:23:11] <%kyh9> Imagine of Sony was still trying to push Playstation Home

[0:23:29] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus PARRY STRONG
[0:23:31] <UrsaDoom> awww, I hate melee counters
[0:23:39] <maxpasta> That was sick
[0:23:42] <%Afterman_> melee counters are godly in thi sgame
[0:23:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SO GOOD
[0:23:43] <%Akizea> it's so good in this game tho
[0:23:45] <+NickHatesSnow> The one good thing from other m
[0:23:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie likes parries? Who knew
[0:23:49] <%ToomaKH7> wait where did the game say we were? Is it possible we'll get a brinstar theme? im justa nerd i love the brinstar theme lmao
[0:23:49] <hollumdusk> @UrsaDoom They are far better implemented on this one
[0:23:49] <%probably_facetious> I LOVE melee counters
[0:23:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Woolie likes a parry? Who would've guessed?
[0:23:55] <+TheFrancix> GUN PARRY
[0:23:56] <Rostichenburg> AM2R has way too much dumb fan game stuff
[0:24:06] <+NickHatesSnow> Other M added some cool stuff
[0:24:08] <valkuma> isnt this just Sci-Fi Blasphemous
[0:24:10] <UrsaDoom> @UrsaDoom I just don't like them in general
[0:24:15] <+NickHatesSnow> It was the DmC of Metroid
[0:24:15] <%BackwardCap> Why'd Chozo Space Bird have a Pirate hat on? gildedThink
[0:24:16] <%LastHazzerd> plus it's like the same animation she has in smash
[0:24:27] <+DatAsuna> I like parries but that bug animation on hit was pretty lame
[0:24:28] <%Dr00_PhD> @valkuma Blasphemous is catholic metroid
[0:24:34] <jetstreamrey> Can't wait for him to get to the part where [REDACTED] reveals {SPOILERS}
[0:24:34] <FrostedZaibatsu> nice reactions
[0:24:37] <F_Wily> @NickHatesSnow It did, it just came with a bad package.
[0:24:37] <AzureSynesthesia> the parry for normal enemies is pretty forgiving
[0:24:38] <Darren716> Btw you dont have to run and slide, as long as you're pushing to the side and press it you'll slide
[0:24:43] <+Bearborg> sadly nope, no bestiary
[0:24:43] <%HollowedIdjit> Sadly no
[0:24:47] <%Dakuu75> oh yeah, is there a beastary?
[0:24:47] <+DatAsuna> this ain't prime
[0:24:50] <linSP> the first smash had her punching and kicking, every Metroid game after should‚Äôve  had SOME melee
[0:24:51] <Saltmeisterr> Thats only prime
[0:24:53] <%Prevot> scanning in 2D would be fucking awful
[0:24:55] <%RyuuAoi> Yeah there should honestly be scanning ngl woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:24:56] <%Dakuu75> -oh
[0:24:58] <Dave_VD> I‚Äôve never been big into Metroid but this game looks awesome, I‚Äôll have to check it out
[0:25:11] <Rostichenburg> @Prevot It would basically be the Xray scope from Super
[0:25:15] <emMmDeeKay> don't be afraid to spend missiles
[0:25:17] <%ToomaKH7> now we gotta wait for charge beam to woolie can be a Big Shot
[0:25:24] <@Commando_Joe> look at these slugmas just sluggin everywhere
[0:25:27] <+CalderGaming> anti-goblin tech
[0:25:27] <%Prevot> @rostichenburg always hated using that thing
[0:25:27] <+BedHome> samus should have a melee weapon change my mind
[0:25:30] <+N0rthW1ndDr1fter> Jeez she moves so smoooooothly
[0:25:32] <%kyh9> QOL
[0:25:34] <$MonsterEnvy> It's teaching you a new thing woolie
[0:25:35] <hollumdusk> You can still dash melee small enemies if you are on a hurry.
[0:25:37] <%kyh9> Yeah, PAt was Ecstatic
[0:25:38] <Rostichenburg> @Prevot It's terrible

[0:25:46] <%RyuuAoi> @prevot There be shit on the screen I want lore for!
[0:25:47] <KnivesEve> goblins defeated
[0:25:47] <%probably_facetious> @bedhome Give Samus an axe
[0:25:49] <%HollowedIdjit> I feel like Samus would appreciatea a good spear
[0:25:49] <Saltmeisterr> pats brain is saved
[0:25:50] <Blank9> like the o on old maps
[0:25:52] <guiltyboya> [Big Shot]
[0:25:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> This game is a Goblin Slayer
[0:26:02] <Qsmash_> I don't really think Smash should be the reference point of what Samus should do in her own games.
[0:26:05] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus The game just taught you a new mechanic that you just missed
[0:26:08] <$MonsterEnvy> the Dash melee
[0:26:12] <%Juriasu> monkaS
[0:26:16] <Rostichenburg> There are areas too hidden for the map blinking to work though

[0:26:22] <Estuko> monkaS
[0:26:22] <hollumdusk> @Qsmash_ I mean, it worked for Pit!

[0:26:53] <Ethel9727> Reminding me of Nero first talking to the Angelo

[0:26:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> Thats a KI entrance

[0:27:13] <@Solidus_113> how the fuck
[0:27:15] <hollumdusk> He really skip the tutorial, didn't he? it wasn't a glitch!
[0:27:19] <kapitankolin> @DatAsuna ok

[0:27:21] <%RyuuAoi> Oh just you wait, Woolie.
[0:27:24] <pepinillomaton> Sequence breaking the tutorial boys
[0:27:25] <StarMechV> @WoolieVersus Woolie you skipped a tutorial. it was suppose to teach you you have a frame perfect chance to counter the EMMI
[0:27:26] <Emotional_Sledgehammer> I mean he only skipped it because his counter was on point
[0:27:28] <%HollowedIdjit> No it's fine, Woolie will just successfully parry every single EMMI
[0:27:28] <Ethel9727> Refreshing healing goop
[0:27:30] <Dave_VD> God damn this game looks sweet
[0:27:31] <+CalderGaming> the timing window on that first one is infinite
[0:27:33] <nabs96> yo pls tell me this is the new LP!
[0:27:33] <lambishly> Now I have your power
[0:27:38] <+SilverDevilfish> Omega Brain
[0:27:45] <%BackwardCap> Megaman'd it
[0:27:48] <%MegadBlitz> never trust big brains
[0:27:49] <BurdRightsActivist> EMMI parry is absolute ass
[0:27:50] <nabs96> yo Where's reggie?
[0:27:50] <%Prevot> a brain huh not sus at all
[0:27:54] <%Dakuu75> I don't think it's ever explained why there's just a brain here?
[0:27:56] <%RyuuAoi> @nabs96 Every Sunday would be HYPE
[0:27:59] <%sleepy_coffee> Looks like a ‚Ä¶brain
[0:28:00] <Rostichenburg> You need the reflexes of Kirby Quick Draw for the Emmis
[0:28:02] <+DatAsuna> @DatAsuna quickly, allcaps a dumb surface media reference
[0:28:03] <@Solidus_113> they're the brain computes from Prime 3
[0:28:07] <iacus_> yo
[0:28:08] <%ToomaKH7> Now Woolie, use a [BIG SHOT]
[0:28:09] <Saltmeisterr> @Dakuu75 Brains are ai
[0:28:10] <hollumdusk> @nabs96 Surprise, solo stream, for the Dread hype.
[0:28:10] <pepinillomaton> Metroid V: The Phantom Reggie
[0:28:14] <nabs96> @ryuuaoi would love that!!
[0:28:16] <%SlangPunk> SAMUS GETS A VECTOR CANNON
[0:28:16] <%TheLemuroid> Cinematic blaster btw
[0:28:20] <%HollowedIdjit> @Dakuu75 there are some pretty strong implications about what happened
[0:28:22] <guiltyboya> Big Brain, [BIG SHOT]
[0:28:26] <%Dakuu75> that seems like some cursed Soma kinda stuff
[0:28:29] <nabs96> @hollumdusk Ah OK. so no word on whether it's an LP yet I guess
[0:28:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> [[ BIG SHOT ]]
[0:28:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> VECTOR CANNON
[0:28:38] <$MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus You also missed the Tutorial for the Dash Melee. If you are running while moving and use the melee you will do a melee attack that kills weaker enemies.
[0:28:40] <iacus_> I hear this game is good
[0:28:40] <%ToomaKH7> [BIG SHOT]
[0:28:49] <BurdRightsActivist> [ BIG SHOT ]

[0:29:28] <Maxiheeho> it takes a bit to get used to the controls
[0:29:30] <+DatAsuna> The X button gets me way worse than the shoulder buttons for nintendo
[0:29:32] <+shadowsvrse> been hjanging around pat too much lul
[0:29:34] <Shad0wTag> DAMN YOU DECADE
[0:29:34] <StarMechV> YOUR OTHER RIGHT

[0:29:44] <+alphonseisbest> NICE
[0:29:45] <+shoryukenabotch> JACKPOT?
[0:29:50] <brachydios777> Starbord
[0:29:52] <Rostichenburg> Nintendo has had the X button in the same place for 30 years
[0:29:53] <taquito_blade> timing is a bitch for emmis
[0:30:10] <%Afterman_> i also blame decade
[0:30:14] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg Really? Where's X on the wii?
[0:30:17] <AzureSynesthesia> the emmi parry time actually varies slightly so its hard to do
[0:30:18] <+alphonseisbest> yup yup
[0:30:23] <$MonsterEnvy> Woolie you missed a tutorial the text changed while you were climbing up.
[0:30:25] <+alphonseisbest> feels weird
[0:30:26] <%LastHazzerd> X is top face button
[0:30:27] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg And the gamecube?
[0:30:30] <Rostichenburg> @DatAsuna Same place on the classic controller
[0:30:30] <%RyuuAoi> It's a new game after 10+ years, Woolie. You are forgiven.
[0:30:31] <%LastHazzerd> B is bottom
[0:30:31] <F_Wily> Oh that mixup....
[0:30:36] <+shadowsvrse> edid nintendo release the n64  on the switch?
[0:30:39] <emMmDeeKay> You can PERFECT GUARD the attacks from the robbuts, but you need to be FRAME PERFECT
[0:30:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> Remember Nintendo came first
[0:30:52] <%TheLemuroid> Sealed doors like that open from one side only
[0:30:54] <hassanico2> oh shit surprise solo stream?
[0:30:54] <+D00msDayDan> the parry window is too small to humanly react to, you have to anticipate it
[0:30:57] <Saltmeisterr> SQUATTIN
[0:30:58] <taquito_blade> I really hope nintendo releases the trilogy
[0:30:58] <%LastHazzerd> is there a list of tutorials in the menu?
[0:31:03] <%HollowedIdjit> the coolest save room
[0:31:05] <pet_purple_panda> @LastHazzerd Wii is AB + - 1 2
[0:31:06] <Darren716> Yeah if an EMMI grabs you you'll half a frame to do an X counter to them to break free
[0:31:08] <hollumdusk> @LastHazzerd Yes
[0:31:08] <%Prevot> BIRD SQUAT
[0:31:09] <+CalderGaming> @LastHazzerd yes
[0:31:10] <Rostichenburg> Yeah the tutorials get saved
[0:31:21] <Shad0wTag> @taquito_blade they will and watch it emulate worse than the wii version
[0:31:23] <%BackwardCap> woolieS woolieT
[0:31:24] <+DatAsuna> @FrostedZaibatsu And they didn't use it for a decade so meh
[0:31:28] <%Prevot> ZDR must be Chozo Russia

[0:32:14] <hassanico2> huh
[0:32:14] <Shad0wTag> @taquito_blade Nintendo will make it joycon only with no controller support

[0:34:13] <TigerClaws12> royal guard
[0:34:13] <Estuko> ROYAL GUARD GOD
[0:34:13] <redwidow1358> FIRST TRY
[0:34:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> The shmoovement
[0:34:14] <+DigiDom> EZ Clap
[0:34:14] <KnivesEve> GDI Why am I not surprised

[0:34:17] <Shad0wTag> CLIP IT LADS!!
[0:34:20] <$Lunaar> those are not ez bro
[0:34:20] <kapitankolin> when you get that emmi parry, it's always sick as hell
[0:34:23] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus They are PERSISTENT
[0:34:23] <dukenux> GAMER
[0:34:26] <%Afterman_> i want that shit in print!
[0:34:26] <Hammatime8> Metroid is a horror game now. Neat!
[0:34:27] <StarMechV> HIS FIGHTING GAME SKILLS ARE COMIGN HANDY
[0:34:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @StarMechV
[0:34:28] <+toastybites> fighting game skills put to good use
[0:34:32] <Yakobro> @Solidus_113 need to unlock easy mode Kappa
[0:34:34] <%kyh9> The Woolsworth enjoys parry mechanics
[0:34:35] <fairore> i thought were a gonner for sure
[0:34:38] <StarMechV> tHE FIGHTING GAME SKILLS ARE PAYING OFF
[0:34:45] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg Y is top center and X is mid right.
[0:35:02] <dukenux> i love the portal ass music
[0:35:03] <+TheFrancix> metroid souls
[0:35:06] <emMmDeeKay> Woolie parrying the EMMIs only works if you do it FRAME PERFECT, Good Job
[0:35:07] <Hyphen_Sum> Shine Spark?
[0:35:12] <%Afterman_> that green in the dark is so good
[0:35:13] <%Javaa01> Can't get through the metal detector
[0:35:17] <dukenux> Event Horizon?
[0:35:19] <taquito_blade> hey look it's Adam
[0:35:19] <omnishadeee> was expecting u to play it offline and force reggie to play through it, this is a welcome surprise
[0:35:23] <Asuterisuku> The GCN layout is the SNES layout rotated clockwise.
[0:35:26] <Rostichenburg> @DatAsuna Relative to each other though one is left the other is right
[0:35:29] <%RyuuAoi> Just you wait, Woolie
[0:35:31] <%TrafficCohen> Oh hey, Adam
[0:35:32] <%kyh9> @emMmDeeKay The Metroid Dread FEARS the fighting game player
[0:35:35] <Estuko> Clipped it just in case.
[0:35:36] <Yakobro> LUL
[0:35:38] <%RyuuAoi> You're gonna get your dark
[0:35:39] <$Lunaar> YEAH DUDE
[0:35:39] <%HollowedIdjit> against the EMMI they are
[0:35:40] <%kyh9> The Emmi Ones
[0:35:40] <$Lunaar> GG
[0:35:41] <taquito_blade> yes they are.
[0:35:44] <+chiazam> Oh hey its our commander
[0:35:45] <%LastHazzerd> EMMI parries
[0:35:46] <brachydios777> GAMER
[0:35:47] <Jrocy247> You DID skip the tutorial afterall
[0:35:48] <AzureSynesthesia> the parry window for emmis vary
[0:35:49] <dukenux> Emmi :)
[0:35:52] <%TrafficCohen> Samus is plus on block?
[0:35:57] <Estuko> Will people find it or should I post it for folk who missed it
[0:36:00] <%Prevot> I've played for like 6 hours and only gotten like 7 parries on EMMI
[0:36:07] <+HakureiIllusion> Surprising they don't just have audio receptors to begin with
[0:36:09] <emMmDeeKay> FIRST TRY
[0:36:13] <Asuterisuku> There are two seperate parry windows. They are both single frame.
[0:36:48] <Shade075> I got unreasonably hyped when Adam told me my chances of survival, dat glorious fusion nostalgia.
[0:36:50] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg The vertical positioning and layout matters, the entire point of consistency is the muscle memory. Changing layouts entirely fucks with that. X being above and to the right then below and to the right/Y being the leftmost to centered top is inconsistent
[0:36:51] <taquito_blade> emmi zones are nerve wracking lol
[0:36:56] <%MegadBlitz> I've gotten only a few clutch parries
[0:36:56] <%Dakuu75> Adam, I'm trying to sneak around. But, i'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass-cheeks keeps alerting the EMMI~!
[0:36:59] <+DatAsuna> tl;dr It's not the same layout
[0:37:00] <kikoeru_san> lol
[0:37:06] <dukenux> feel the [insert subtitle here]
[0:37:06] <hollumdusk> Unless you play Third Strike!
[0:37:08] <%TrafficCohen> "Virtually Impossible"
[0:37:09] <AngryAsian5> VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE LUL
[0:37:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BRUH
[0:37:14] <lloyddboy> VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
[0:37:15] <brachydios777> lol
[0:37:17] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie is the 1%
[0:37:19] <@Solidus_113> "get fucked lmao"
[0:37:22] <%MegadBlitz> gotta kill those brains
[0:37:22] <+Parrish_broadnax> Adam: Ayo Samus you weak as F@$#% Gurl"
[0:37:23] <%TrafficCohen> 1%
[0:37:25] <Estuko> gonna keep this clip immortalized
[0:37:26] <BurdRightsActivist> "get shidded on"
[0:37:26] <%RyuuAoi> Don't FIGHT
[0:37:27] <emMmDeeKay> "Virtually imppssible" does it on FIRST TRY
[0:37:29] <locbont> simply survive
[0:37:29] <Calek> and they made it good
[0:37:29] <dukenux> Objective: SURVIVE
[0:37:30] <%kyh9> ANDIT CAME OUT THE YEAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED
[0:37:31] <+scwry> and they made it GOOD
[0:37:31] <hassanico2> To be fair, for any other streamers it IS virtually impossible LUL
[0:37:33] <Rostichenburg> @DatAsuna No but the gamecube controller is a weirdo outlier anyway
[0:37:33] <$Lunaar> You're living in the good timeline, Woolie
[0:37:34] <hassanico2> Cause they suck at that QTE
[0:37:35] <kikoeru_san> Woolie IS the 1% Adam
[0:37:37] <Shad0wTag> I hope someone here clipped that shit
[0:37:41] <+cavefishes> dang dude nintendo made a METROID GAME IN 2021?
[0:37:41] <%TrafficCohen> Samus Return'ed on the 3ds LUL
[0:37:41] <+Pixel_Matt> CURRENT OBJECTIVE: SURVIVE
[0:37:48] <Rostichenburg> She already Returned there was a whole game about it
[0:37:49] <%RyuuAoi> Man what a time to be alive
[0:37:49] <pet_purple_panda> @Dakuu75 To be fair, Samus is stupid thicc
[0:37:51] <redwidow1358> SURVIVE
[0:37:53] <Estuko> @Shad0wTag 'm sure a few people and myself snagged it lol
[0:37:58] <+LandOfTheWay> Samus: "I spend an entire game with the SA-X and now I gotta deal with this shit again."
[0:38:00] <Hammatime8> Woolie really just flexed on everyone the first chance he got and didn't know
[0:38:03] <AzureSynesthesia> yeah, its cool that they clearly revived the same original project
[0:38:07] <guiltyboya> "let's develop a drone that can't be disabled with conventional weaponry if it goes awol, hat could go wrong?"
[0:38:10] <+cavefishes> I feel like i'm gonna end up picking this one up
[0:38:22] <emper0rner0> Well with the issues that Prime 4 has been having, 2D Metroid might be the future of the series LUL
[0:38:23] <dukenux> no more SA-X, only cold machinery now
[0:38:23] <Louie_Salmon> Can't crawl
[0:38:25] <+D00msDayDan> half this game is "boy i bet you wish you had morph ball right now"
[0:38:25] <dukenux> :(
[0:38:27] <Saltmeisterr> WHY CAN'T METROID CRAWL
[0:38:31] <@Solidus_113> they really make you work for morph ball in this game
[0:38:34] <@Menitta> y cant Metroid crawl
[0:38:36] <%Javaa01> It's gonna be a *while* until you get to become an orb
[0:38:39] <%Prevot> metroid can slide but not crawl
[0:38:40] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg So was the wiimote, so was the N64 6 button layout. They have not been as consistent as xbox/ps was the reason this came up
[0:38:42] <+TheFrancix> DREAD ZONE
[0:38:42] <DXLelouch24> look at the map woolie, game tells you if theres powerups or not you didnt get
[0:38:43] <Asuterisuku> Samus Returns was a proof of concept for THIS game.
[0:38:52] <%RyuuAoi> @saltmeisterr Because she's in the suit. Duh
[0:38:54] <DXLelouch24> ITS SUCH A GOOD MAP
[0:38:54] <mield916> metroid need to learn ball
[0:39:04] <hassanico2> why can't Metroid ball
[0:39:06] <+scwry> ive been devouring this game and at the moment, im thinking it could be better than super metroid
[0:39:07] <maxpasta> Why would Metroid ever bother crawling if she knows how amazing morph balling is
[0:39:25] <DXLelouch24> @scwry 100% it is
[0:39:28] <Saltmeisterr> for real tho "y can't metroid crawl" is a very apt meme for this game
[0:39:32] <Rostichenburg> @DatAsuna My point was any time they do a classic layout it's the same the only ones that didn't were weido controllers like N64 and Gamecube
[0:39:33] <dukenux> üîµ <--- metroid
[0:39:34] <glimzemal> I really like you can see Samus put her hand on a  wall when she presses up to it with an opening.
[0:39:36] <Shad0wTag> @scwry is it better than fusion tho
[0:39:45] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:39:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[0:39:45] <+scwry> @DXLelouch24 and super metroid is my favourite game ever made...
[0:39:53] <Estuko> monkaS
[0:39:54] <Rostichenburg> Who knows how much this concept survived I imagine just the stalker gameplay was what they wanted to do but couldn't due to hardware
[0:39:54] <double_zr_tap> do it!
[0:39:57] <double_zr_tap> go go go!
[0:39:58] <pet_purple_panda> @Rostichenburg Wait technically the wiimote does have X and Y, its a motion controller. Holly shit
[0:39:58] <%RyuuAoi> He comin
[0:39:59] <Saltmeisterr> it takes a while before u get ball
[0:39:59] <Darren716> F
[0:39:59] <%sjay662> OH LAWD SHE COMIN
[0:40:00] <double_zr_tap> oh no!!
[0:40:02] <+samuraicaveman> white EMMIs can't craw

[0:40:16] <$ArCielArDor> you have been sampled
[0:40:20] <+thelovingfool> its a quick and brutal animation too
[0:40:20] <Shad0wTag> @scwry bold statement
[0:40:23] <+CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus you don't need a run-up for the slide to work
[0:40:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HE GON LEARN TODAY
[0:40:25] <Louie_Salmon> Chance of survival now sits at 50%
[0:40:25] <redwidow1358> He caught you lackin
[0:40:26] <%Dakuu75> Woolie is mortal, after all~ lol
[0:40:27] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg Except weirdo controllers are 16 years of their consoles
[0:40:27] <hollumdusk> Back to humble
[0:40:28] <dukenux> just *schlink* DEAD
[0:40:29] <mf_gouki> That was sick!
[0:40:32] <pet_purple_panda> Fuckin' Wiimote had X Axis and Y Axis
[0:40:32] <%LastHazzerd> i love how they have an animation for wiffed inputs
[0:40:32] <%HollowedIdjit> you did not tech that.
[0:40:35] <AzureSynesthesia> checkpoints are very forgiving for emmi zones and bosses
[0:40:37] <Asuterisuku> GENEROUS checkpoints.
[0:40:37] <taquito_blade> watch woolie die 5 times a row
[0:40:37] <+faeron93> Man, this feels scarier than the SA-X
[0:40:38] <Alzero83> Youve been Identified!
[0:40:38] <+chiazam> Pick your Exit
[0:40:46] <Hyphen_Sum> That's a big mosquito
[0:41:10] <dukenux> is it EMMI making those sounds?
[0:41:13] <taquito_blade> lol
[0:41:17] <Chichen> @dukenux yep
[0:41:18] <+CalderGaming> @dukenux yup
[0:41:18] <Saltmeisterr> @dukenux yep
[0:41:18] <redwidow1358> Remember to tech the grab folks
[0:41:19] <taquito_blade> stressful
[0:41:20] <brachydios777> yes
[0:41:22] <%RyuuAoi> They want dat ASS
[0:41:24] <dukenux> cute :)
[0:41:32] <Malchiah_Tenabre> the baby ?
[0:41:40] <%Prevot> SA-X footsteps were replaced by beep boops
[0:41:41] <dukenux> da baby
[0:41:43] <BurdRightsActivist> Da baby
[0:41:46] <Shad0wTag> @malchiah_tenabre da baby
[0:41:48] <%TrafficCohen> Damn Samus
[0:41:52] <BurdRightsActivist> the baby
[0:41:52] <OneSassyMoogle> Yakkity SA-X
[0:41:54] <+thelovingfool> i really appreciate the heckpoints in this game
[0:41:57] <SHAKETHEW> Bruh, yes, that's how the SA-X should have been
[0:41:57] <Saltmeisterr> they are way more prevalent than the SA-X tho
[0:42:01] <+chiazam> Samus Aran - X
[0:42:04] <emMmDeeKay> samus looks sassy AF when saving progress
[0:42:07] <Saltmeisterr> also E
[0:42:20] <Bananassassin> Ah yes the struggle jump
[0:42:33] <+thelovingfool> i tried really hard for that one
[0:42:38] <%Dakuu75> yeah, anytime Samus stands up straight, it's the most powerful looking pose i've ever seen.\
[0:42:45] <Rostichenburg> @DatAsuna The classic controller was released alongside the Wii so it was just N64 and gamecube and in that time the GBA and DS used the classic orientation
[0:42:58] <dukenux> too  slippery
[0:43:13] <Darren716> It cant
[0:43:14] <%HollowedIdjit> It can't actually
[0:43:17] <%Afterman_> i dont think it does
[0:43:17] <+thelovingfool> it wont
[0:43:21] <+CalderGaming> wall uncover explosions cannot hurt you
[0:43:34] <drunken_lemur> Dynamic water physics!
[0:43:35] <emper0rner0> This water mechanic seems pretty neat, oddly reminds me of a kirby mechanic
[0:43:40] <%TrafficCohen> Lorll
[0:43:43] <+TheFrancix> morph ball time?
[0:43:44] <+DatAsuna> @Rostichenburg The fact you're talking about a secondary controller alone that had only partial support for games speaks to the inconsistency.
[0:43:45] <%Dakuu75> every streamer I've seen so far, avoids it, out of reflex
[0:43:49] <+TheFrancix> map?
[0:43:50] <%ennui_on_me> @TheFrancix nope
[0:43:55] <%TheLemuroid> @TheFrancix You wish
[0:43:58] <Saltmeisterr> also
[0:43:59] <Timarkot> Why doesn't her colors match? Its bothering me
[0:44:00] <nabs96> hey guys so u think it's worth getting one of those switch vouchers that let me redeem 2 games? I was thinking of using them for metroid and SMT5
[0:44:04] <Saltmeisterr> this game is BIG
[0:44:10] <Asuterisuku> Very vague map.
[0:44:13] <%TrafficCohen> @Timarkot It's her Fusion outfit
[0:44:20] <Calek> @nabs96 that sounds like a rad choice
[0:44:21] <Saltmeisterr> this is a MEATY game
[0:44:21] <+scwry> @nabs96 wise choice, they last a year too
[0:44:21] <+DatAsuna> The fact remains that for 16 years they did not use a standardised layout, having a secondary layout only makes it LESS consistent.
[0:44:23] <Chichen> @Timarkot she gets different suits. Also the under armor got turned into the fusion suit in fusion
[0:44:24] <+faeron93> Man, no E-tank upgrades
[0:44:32] <Timarkot> Ok thx
[0:44:34] <%RyuuAoi> @timarkot Blue and whit match
[0:44:39] <%Prevot> this suit looks good in blue and purple, but the orange version looks terrible IMO
[0:44:45] <+thelovingfool> i love her colors, the white makes me like some of the suites i dont care for
[0:45:02] <%Afterman_> i think this blue and white suit is best after her OG fusion suit. thats the goat
[0:45:03] <+thelovingfool> i usually dislike normal grav suite
[0:45:04] <Rostichenburg> I got used to the orange but not my favourite of these suits
[0:45:09] <Carlioo> imagine having a morph ball
[0:45:14] <AzureSynesthesia> the game will actually close off a lot of rooms behind you o you cant explore that much
[0:45:14] <nabs96> @calek @scwry Right? it's basically a 15 pound discount too if u put them together. Only thing that was stopping me I guess is that they might go on sale for cheaper before that happens.
[0:45:20] <Rostichenburg> Much better than the Fusion Varia suit
[0:45:22] <%Prevot> the white goes well with cool colors
[0:45:25] <pet_purple_panda> @DatAsuna tbf the Wii was like a mutant in general, but yeah nintendo really needed to settle on a single layout
[0:45:29] <hollumdusk> Oh, it may take Woolie a while to realize, but this game tease you with a lot of dead ends, with the rate you unlock power ups.
[0:45:40] <%RyuuAoi> This suit is legit imo
[0:45:43] <+scwry> @nabs96 Nintendo games dont often go on sale, especially for lower than the voucher discount
[0:45:43] <%HollowedIdjit> the Light Suit just looks super slick
[0:45:43] <Saltmeisterr> light suit is great
[0:45:45] <+DatAsuna> Cause the light suit was cash
[0:45:51] <Darren716> The light suit is almost unfair, it's so damn clean
[0:45:55] <ashenchevalierthesecond> The light suit looks alien as all hell, that's what makes it cool
[0:46:00] <+DatAsuna> It was slim and sleek too
[0:46:11] <+DatAsuna> Though I also quite liked the dark suit
[0:46:16] <+HellHunter120> I like that she has a different running animation when she's underwater
[0:46:20] <DevilHands_> Still kinda bummed that we never got an annihilator suit like they wanted...
[0:46:22] <nabs96> @scwry True. Even if SMT does go on sale it won't happen before some time next year. And Metroid most likely won't go on sale either.
[0:46:33] <Shad0wTag> i just wanted the Fusion suit to make a come bacm
[0:46:37] <Shad0wTag> *back
[0:46:37] <%HollowedIdjit> @HellHunter120 it is different ye
[0:46:38] <hollumdusk> The most I see Nintendo games go on sale (official Nintendo sales), is like 33% at most
[0:46:41] <%TrafficCohen> Nice
[0:46:52] <%Afterman_> you can actually parry fairly late i found
[0:46:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:46:53] <KeiganOfAstora> yo did he start at 1 or 3?
[0:46:56] <glimzemal> Fun house is right. :)
[0:46:57] <Darren716> 3
[0:46:58] <%Afterman_> as long as your canon actually conencts
[0:47:00] <%Afterman_> you good
[0:47:04] <+Bailey__Gaming> Game is Super generous on missle pick ups so feel free to spend em
[0:47:05] <%Akizea> reminder that if there's another smash, Samus will DEFFINATELY have the Melee parry
[0:47:09] <hassanico2> @KeiganOfAstora Stream's been up for an hour
[0:47:12] <hassanico2> Gameplay for a bit less
[0:47:13] <%Prevot> normal enemies parry is really forgiving
[0:47:13] <+HellHunter120> Yeah, only EMMI are frame perfect
[0:47:18] <+chiazam> Fun House Time
[0:47:19] <KeiganOfAstora> where's Reggie?

[0:47:34] <%RyuuAoi> @keiganofastora He's a ghost
[0:47:34] <Shade075> I like how certain enemies dont immediatly respawn when you move one room over
[0:47:34] <hollumdusk> @KeiganOfAstora Solo, surprise stream, for the Dread hype
[0:47:42] <KeiganOfAstora> I'm just on my break at work, checking in

[0:47:49] <KeiganOfAstora> thanks
[0:47:53] <Iwashi94> oh nooo
[0:47:53] <Carlioo> @WoolieVersus btw you don't actually need to be running to get the slide, you just need to press forward and it'll do it
[0:48:00] <Rostichenburg> Enemy respawning is annoyingly inconsistent if you're trying to get a power up
[0:48:03] <SunsetJack> Oh no
[0:48:06] <pilotkun> woolie you have to stand on that
[0:48:10] <Darren716> Oh no big blind
[0:48:11] <pilotkun> oh no..

[0:52:43] <%sjay662> Did that guy from your work get mad when he heard it?
[0:52:49] <KeiganOfAstora> I washed to make that my alert tone but it's too long
[0:52:53] <KeiganOfAstora> wanted
[0:53:04] <nabs96> @sjay662 he probably would've thought it was final Fantasy lol
[0:53:09] <SunsetJack> Pseudo Screw Attack
[0:53:12] <KeiganOfAstora> currently I use MoriohCho Radio for my ringtone
[0:53:15] <+superchronicc> its like a screw attack
[0:53:25] <LBC921> OMG they brougth that back?1
[0:53:30] <+HellHunter120> makeshift screw attack
[0:53:32] <Rostichenburg> The Baby Screw Attack
[0:53:32] <+JustToWatch> Morioh Chozo Radio
[0:53:32] <+alphonseisbest> This game is PURE joy
[0:53:35] <brachydios777> RIP Screwattack
[0:53:41] <pet_purple_panda> I've had the pkemon evoloution noise forever
[0:53:47] <+superchronicc> this is my low-budget screw attack build
[0:53:49] <KeiganOfAstora> the walls are lies
[0:53:55] <%RyuuAoi> One of the best aspects of the Metroid series. Figuring shit/tech out that they refuse to tell you.
[0:53:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:53:56] <KeiganOfAstora> more illusory walls than a dark souls
[0:54:00] <pet_purple_panda> dunns dunna
[0:54:03] <+CalderGaming> charge beam in actual metroid games compared to smash is always kind of a letdown because it's mostly "you can open new doors and you have a *backup* in case you run out of missiles"
[0:54:05] <%HollowedIdjit> can't afford real screw attack, charge somersault will do
[0:54:27] <Rostichenburg> Charge beam is great it does a lot of damage
[0:54:33] <hollumdusk> Strong enough for bug and "bats" and little more
[0:54:38] <+HakureiIllusion> I believe it's as strong as a charge shot
[0:54:40] <heartlesshealer> do like the bonk noise in this game
[0:54:41] <Saltmeisterr> E
[0:54:44] <%xeros720> i think the charge spin is just the same power as your charged beam
[0:54:44] <pet_purple_panda> the actual music is set as my family ringtone
[0:54:49] <+superchronicc> e-tank for free
[0:54:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey chat if i've never played a metroid game is this one good to start on or will i be completely lost plotwise
[0:55:06] <%HollowedIdjit> you'd probably be fine
[0:55:09] <Saltmeisterr> @cobalt_phoenix_ It catches you up
[0:55:11] <%HollowedIdjit> they fill you in on the important details
[0:55:12] <%xeros720> nah, they go over all the main bits in the intro, it's not a big deal
[0:55:12] <KeiganOfAstora> read the plot summary on wiki
[0:55:13] <$oflooofy> @cobalt_phoenix_ this game summerizes alot of the older games plot
[0:55:13] <%RyuuAoi> Awe Woolie running around with charge beam ready to go. CLASSIC
[0:55:14] <Shad0wTag> @cobalt_phoenix_ you will be fine
[0:55:15] <+alphonseisbest> @cobalt_phoenix_ this one does a good job catching up
[0:55:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw sweet thanks
[0:55:19] <+superchronicc> @cobalt_phoenix_ you will be lost plotwise since it takes place after fusion
[0:55:19] <Rostichenburg> @cobalt_phoenix_ There's a recap at the start so you'd be fine you might miss some finer details
[0:55:20] <brachydios777> You'll be lost a bit on plot
[0:55:22] <heartlesshealer> you will be the most lost out of all of them only at the start
[0:55:26] <+CalderGaming> @cobalt_phoenix_ this one and Samus Returns are the most user-friendly 2D games, but this one relies on Fusion a lot for story
[0:55:43] <%Javaa01> Parries basically amplify your regular shot damage to charge shot levels
[0:55:50] <heartlesshealer> if only because you won't know what certain names/terms mean
[0:55:55] <brachydios777> The game starts with a summary though
[0:55:55] <+D00msDayDan> the parry is an instant charge shot anyway
[0:56:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> assuming i want to play what comes before, which ones should i start with
[0:56:08] <+V_bob> V_bob subscribed with Prime. 
[0:56:12] <%xeros720> in practice i think the parry gives a lot of bonus damage
[0:56:20] <pet_purple_panda> oh jeez woolie walks with the charge shot active
[0:56:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @HarbingerWolf92
[0:56:23] <KeiganOfAstora> is he placing markers?
[0:56:23] <heartlesshealer> if you play things from before, zero mission is a good place
[0:56:27] <hollumdusk> @cobalt_phoenix_ Zero mission is the most friendly starting point, both in gameplay and story
[0:56:29] <Rostichenburg> @cobalt_phoenix_ Super or Zero Mission
[0:56:36] <Estuko> @Moobot NotLikeThis ow my ears
[0:56:36] <+CalderGaming> the parry shot is one-hit kill on most non-boss enemies even when a missile or charge shot wouldn't do the trick
[0:56:39] <BurdRightsActivist> game said "nice morph ball idiot"
[0:56:46] <%ennui_on_me> Fusion and Samus Returns are the ones that this is really building off of
[0:56:47] <%Javaa01> @cobalt_phoenix_ Samus Returns on the 3DS is the most obvious one, since it's the same devs and same mechanics, but obviously it's still held hostage by the corpse of the 3DS
[0:56:49] <+HellHunter120> There are a ton of little animation details in this game that feel so good, like her putting her hand on the wall when you press against it
[0:56:50] <HarbingerWolf92> WoolieVS Metroid Prime Trilogy when?
[0:56:52] <Rostichenburg> Playing Zero Mission before Super can make Super feel dated
[0:57:01] <Chichen> how do metroid crawl???
[0:57:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thanks again chat
[0:57:04] <+alphonseisbest> @hollumdusk is ZERO mission the the remake of M1?
[0:57:11] <Saltmeisterr> y can't metroid crawl man
[0:57:19] <%KetsuoTaberu> Physical amnesia, Metroid can't crawl
[0:57:20] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg A little at first, but just in controls, then the maps and difficulty makes up for that.
[0:57:22] <%ennui_on_me> @Rostichenburg can confirm, Zero Mission was my first and it made Super... not really good to go back to
[0:57:23] <Rostichenburg> @alphonseisbest Yes
[0:57:26] <Shad0wTag> @alphonseisbest yes
[0:57:27] <+Bailey__Gaming> Walls are suggestions
[0:57:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Maybe she has Short Term Memory loss Kappa
[0:57:30] <hollumdusk> @alphonseisbest Yes, with a little of extra lore
[0:57:33] <BurdRightsActivist> awaken.
[0:57:37] <pet_purple_panda> @alphonseisbest also slightly a prequel?
[0:57:37] <KeiganOfAstora> she's part goldfish
[0:57:46] <IntenseNerdRage> @alphonseisbest a remake and retelling
[0:58:00] <+alphonseisbest> cool, thx chat
[0:58:03] <Rostichenburg> The bird DNA makes Samus a little bird brained
[0:58:07] <pet_purple_panda> ^better way of putting it
[0:58:41] <brachydios777> Quick reminder that Samus was adopted by Chozo after Ridley killed her colony and family
[0:58:52] <Shad0wTag> The bird DNA makes her like shiny objects
[0:58:57] <IntenseNerdRage> quick reminder Ridley is still a bitch
[0:59:01] <+scwry> monkaS
[0:59:09] <Shad0wTag> @intensenerdrage he never stopped
[0:59:14] <+chiazam> Looking at the map while you're in the EMMI Zone would help
[0:59:15] <IntenseNerdRage> Lol
[0:59:18] <AzureSynesthesia> best theme in the game imo
[0:59:18] <Saltmeisterr> samus is like a horrible petri dish at this point
[0:59:20] <hollumdusk> @IntenseNerdRage Maybe? I think he is dead for good now... or at least for another couple of games
[0:59:44] <kirbykyodai> @hollumdusk idk how you'd come back from being an x parasite
[0:59:50] <Shad0wTag> @hollumdusk Considering we have Bird Vergil I think your right
[0:59:56] <Saltmeisterr> walls are a liw woolie
[0:59:57] <+thelovingfool> ceiling?
[0:59:57] <+chiazam> You've killed Ridley like twice he should be dead
[0:59:58] <Darren716> Missles are good for checking
[1:00:01] <$oflooofy> This games music is top
[1:00:03] <Rostichenburg> They could clone him again or finish that robot they were working on
[1:00:06] <emeraldskrull> my fantasy football team is ded i guess now my sunday is for woolie stream
[1:00:07] <hollumdusk> @kirbykyodai Well, according to Other M, you can clone him, and he will keeps his memory
[1:00:17] <Rostichenburg> Or Digital Consciousness
[1:00:21] <kirbykyodai> is other M even canon still?
[1:00:22] <IntenseNerdRage> is Ridley just the Vergil of Metroid
[1:00:24] <%HollowedIdjit> HE'S PRETTY SICK
[1:00:27] <%xeros720> Bird Up
[1:00:28] <kirbykyodai> i genuinely don't know
[1:00:28] <+HakureiIllusion> BIRD UP
[1:00:30] <brachydios777> BIRD UP
[1:00:30] <LBC921> was that a remix of the vents area song from fusion?
[1:00:31] <heartlesshealer> Birdgil
[1:00:31] <Qsmash_> birdman is pretty cool
[1:00:33] <Rostichenburg> As long as Adam exists Other M is canon
[1:00:37] <+Bailey__Gaming> good ol Birdgil
[1:00:38] <Shad0wTag> I NEED MORE BIRD SEED
[1:00:39] <%tempestzephyr> he's cool
[1:00:42] <Darren716> Dig up stupid
[1:00:43] <pet_purple_panda> Yeah I always wanted full on Robo Ridley
[1:00:50] <+chiazam> Woolie that Chozo is too cool for you
[1:00:52] <hollumdusk> @kirbykyodai Yes, they still reference it in marketing timelines, and in some extra spoilers
[1:00:52] <%ennui_on_me> You can *never* beat Raven Beak at your current power! Never ever ever! You're so weak Samus!
[1:00:53] <+superchronicc> robots aint got shit on air supeiority
[1:00:58] <+alphonseisbest> Other M being Canon is fine cuz we have DREAD now
[1:00:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:02] <Shad0wTag> @rostichenburg they are not the same Adam
[1:01:07] <spawnzie> yeah Birdgil takes the attention from everything else
[1:01:07] <%jinking79> Woolie gonna love burd boy fight
[1:01:08] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Bird boy has one of the sickest villain designs in the series, he's so good
[1:01:12] <Qsmash_> Well, there was Mecha Ridley in Zero Mission
[1:01:13] <AzureSynesthesia> @LBC921 def sounds like its a remix of sector 1
[1:01:25] <%ennui_on_me> god the final boss in this game is the most hype shit
[1:01:26] <Rostichenburg> @Shad0wTag I mean one's an AI version of the other so
[1:01:31] <brachydios777> Zero mission has robot Ridley
[1:01:36] <pet_purple_panda> @Qsmash_ yeah but thats techno organic. I want full robot
[1:01:45] <Darren716> Btw missiles will reveal what blocks are destroyable
[1:01:57] <+scwry> oh cool im glad it does that
[1:01:59] <Rostichenburg> @pet_purple_panda You got half a robot
[1:02:01] <Shad0wTag> @rostichenburg Considering how they didn't mention it in the prologue I doubt it
[1:02:06] <heartlesshealer> I'm pretty sure the only full robot in the series so far is maybe the EMMIs
[1:02:08] <BurdRightsActivist> game said water you doin
[1:02:12] <kirbykyodai> final boss in this is some anime shit
[1:02:17] <AzureSynesthesia> yeah the game is actually constantly locking you into a forward path lol
[1:02:36] <Darren716> Big brain hours
[1:02:36] <%Afterman_> @AzureSynesthesia  apparently there are a good number of sequence breaks though
[1:02:49] <Saltmeisterr> @Afterman_ oh there is
[1:02:50] <+thelovingfool> woolie we'll figure itout
[1:02:54] <+scwry> theres even special boss cutscenes if you sequence break
[1:03:01] <BurdRightsActivist> NotLikeThis
[1:03:01] <%Afterman_> yeah i heard about that one scwry
[1:03:04] <hollumdusk> @Afterman_ I read about them, you can even skip a boss, and get the gravity suit early, but I haven't look into it yet
[1:03:08] <%xeros720> ah, naruhodo
[1:03:11] <%xeros720> shoot the walls
[1:03:19] <hollumdusk> Also, not sure if the devs will be cool about the sequence breaking, or patch it later
[1:03:20] <%Afterman_> im still on my first playthrough lol, maybe like 70 percent in. game is so good
[1:03:26] <Rostichenburg> Early Gravity Suit would be nice
[1:03:28] <%Afterman_> im sure they will leave it
[1:03:30] <heartlesshealer> samus just wants to eat the bug
[1:03:32] <%Afterman_> metroids all about breaking the game
[1:03:33] <+Bailey__Gaming> Missle the walls, teach them to fear you
[1:03:33] <+scwry> @hollumdusk the devs purposefully put them in
[1:03:43] <+thelovingfool> remember it will tell you theres a hidden ITEM, not a hidden wall
[1:03:44] <hollumdusk> Oh, cool!
[1:03:46] <drunken_lemur> Has Woolie said if this was a One off?
[1:03:52] <%tempestzephyr> the Succ
[1:03:55] <Shad0wTag> @rostichenburg instead its anti burd suit
[1:03:59] <Saltmeisterr> @hollumdusk no like the devs said sequence breaking is intentional
[1:04:01] <%Deft_Thought> The counter-strike mechanic is from the Samus Returns remake, yeah?
[1:04:03] <Shad0wTag> @drunken_lemur its a full lp
[1:04:07] <%Afterman_> yeah its from the remake
[1:04:08] <Darren716> I like how obvious they make it that doors are hoot.cold
[1:04:08] <Shad0wTag> @deft_thought yeah
[1:04:08] <+Bailey__Gaming> Hot Zone
[1:04:12] <+scwry> @hollumdusk theres even special boss kill cutscenes if youve managed to sequence break
[1:04:13] <Darren716> *hoot/cold
[1:04:16] <hollumdusk> @Deft_Thought Yes, but highly improved now
[1:04:19] <%RyuuAoi> @drunken_lemur We are praying for every Sunday
[1:04:21] <%Deft_Thought> Word, I never played it
[1:04:23] <%Afterman_> the doors show you the temp of the room when you shoot them open
[1:04:25] <Qsmash_> get mixed
[1:04:28] <%Deft_Thought> It looks neat. Thanks y'all
[1:04:28] <Blank9> I always  dip in just to get it on the map
[1:04:28] <Estuko> LUL
[1:04:31] <brachydios777> That's Arizona
[1:04:32] <+TheFrancix> 1HP
[1:04:34] <%Afterman_> bird up
[1:04:35] <+pupil31> LOL
[1:04:37] <GeoGio3> them phallic birds have moves
[1:04:38] <%xeros720> delayed wakeup is a powerful tool
[1:04:42] <eriksdrums> Cheer1000 Happy early Thanksgiving, my dude!  Just beat my first Metroid game yesterday (Zero Mission) and wanted to spread the love.  Love your stuff!
[1:04:43] <Rostichenburg> Getting them on the map is the most important
[1:04:48] <$brave_sj> I wouldn't call lava zone Grenada or Jamaica. It's a nice, dry heat.
[1:04:49] <%Afterman_> he squawkin over here
[1:04:54] <+Bailey__Gaming> Chozo Architecture is my Jam
[1:04:58] <spawnzie> Worm's corner pressure is crazy
[1:05:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> The two death zones: Canada and Grenada
[1:05:08] <%RyuuAoi> Texas humid AF
[1:05:11] <+xerotwo> doodWat
[1:05:12] <%Afterman_> @Bailey__Gaming best alien architect imo.
[1:05:18] <%Deft_Thought> Yo, which side is Bird on?? 50/50 every time
[1:05:21] <+megaman_sentinel> Mississippi
[1:05:32] <%HollowedIdjit> bird can only do overhead tho
[1:05:33] <Daxalog> Does Grenada and Jamaica have the same barred up windows as everywhere else?
[1:05:33] <pet_purple_panda> @RyuuAoi San Antonio summers on the river are like Norfair
[1:05:37] <%Afterman_> nah he will get to missisippi later, its got all the kudzu
[1:05:39] <goroke> That humid heat that makes you sweat while it's raining
[1:05:39] <brachydios777> New Mexico
[1:05:46] <$ArCielArDor> like Florida
[1:05:49] <%Deft_Thought> J-j-jam it in
[1:05:53] <Rostichenburg> Why is her gun a USB?
[1:06:01] <Daxalog> TUBES
[1:06:01] <+cleese> tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuubes
[1:06:05] <DevilHands_> :)
[1:06:12] <Darren716> Because chozos designed everything to be gun powered
[1:06:17] <dukenux> tubular B)
[1:06:19] <%Afterman_> chozos are americans, obviously
[1:06:20] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg Chozo tech. Never leave home without an arm canon
[1:06:21] <bevyrage> what if this gives context for all the morph ball tunnels then?
[1:06:23] <%Deft_Thought> Because Chozo'
[1:06:29] <%MelBrooksKA> @Rostichenburg Universal Serial Gun
[1:06:30] <TheSaltminer> sounds like one of those 45 degree Australian summers, heat coming up off the concrete cooks your eyeballs
[1:06:37] <%RyuuAoi> @pet_purple_panda You ain't lying! Even at midnight. Awe let me go out and catch a cool night breeze. Step outside and can't fucking breath from the humidity ha
[1:06:51] <%Prevot> chozo created Morph Ball so of course they love tubes, what's the space pirates excuse for loving tubes?
[1:07:03] <pet_purple_panda> @RyuuAoi loved it, but fuck that weather
[1:07:06] <heartlesshealer> they love crawl
[1:07:08] <Rostichenburg> @Prevot They stole Chozo homes
[1:07:11] <%Deft_Thought> And Chozo tech is FREEDOM tech.
[1:07:12] <hollumdusk> @Prevot Mother Brain teaching her little cute Zebezians how to appreciate them
[1:07:20] <+Bailey__Gaming> @Rostichenburg USB stands for Ultimate Samus Blaster
[1:07:22] <+thelovingfool> its nice you can just follow the pipe
[1:07:31] <%RyuuAoi> @pet_purple_panda Everything is bigger in Texas! woolieGLORY
[1:07:34] <Shad0wTag> @prevot @bailey__gaming i hate cool that sounds
[1:07:47] <+thelovingfool> heat is the key
[1:07:48] <%Prevot> @rostichenburg damn space pirates took our jerbs
[1:07:50] <+Bailey__Gaming> The Klingons know tho
[1:07:54] <solracc25> the slide is so good
[1:07:54] <%Deft_Thought> Do you think Samus names her suits weapons and abilities?
[1:08:03] <brachydios777> Namekians
[1:08:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[1:08:20] <Rostichenburg> Samus' weapons appear to be a galactic standard it's weird
[1:08:21] <%Deft_Thought> Is Tucker Carlson in the BIRD SUIT??
[1:08:31] <$brave_sj> But the government said it was real! It couldn't be bullshit!
[1:08:38] <%Afterman_> @Deft_Thought no way is tucker cool enough, or all enough, to be that birdgil
[1:08:45] <%Afterman_> or tall*
[1:08:48] <%Deft_Thought> @Afterman_ You right
[1:08:51] <DXLelouch24> @Rostichenburg The Chozo made her suit
[1:08:52] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg The Feds have been trying to replicate Chozo tech for years, according to the lore.
[1:08:53] <+Parrish_broadnax> Adam: Stay humble
[1:08:58] <%RyuuAoi> Berdly finally got his nipples. He is the one in the bird suit. Spoilers!
[1:09:02] <Darren716> Woolie they did that in Prime 3
[1:09:04] <dukenux> Goverment also said they were gonna use metroids for peaceful purposes
[1:09:04] <hollumdusk> ... That's half of Other's M plot!
[1:09:06] <+thelovingfool> @WoolieVersus that was other m wasnt it
[1:09:07] <%LastHazzerd> power
[1:09:10] <Rain_Mage> They did that in Prime 3
[1:09:11] <%Afterman_> @Deft_Thought if he bird constantly looked confused, then ye its carlson
[1:09:12] <%Prevot> that never goes well
[1:09:14] <%Afterman_> if the*
[1:09:18] <+alphonseisbest> ...so Other m?
[1:09:22] <Monkeyweed21> A mother brain the size of a football that you can carry around
[1:09:28] <Rostichenburg> They were like uploading weapon data to her suit in Fusion and the Feds had versions of her equipment in other M
[1:09:30] <locbont> 100% safe idea. might even be the safest idea
[1:09:31] <solracc25> Just like the metroids
[1:09:31] <%Afterman_> tucker carlson is just the evolved form of baby ridley from other m
[1:09:33] <+megaman_sentinel> but your ship is on the surface lol
[1:09:41] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Should I play Other M?
[1:09:45] <+eldrinos> woolie the game marked the thermal doors youve already seen on your map
[1:09:46] <+thelovingfool> no
[1:09:47] <Calek> @RyuuAoi no
[1:09:49] <pet_purple_panda> @RyuuAoi no
[1:09:53] <%ennui_on_me> if you want to
[1:09:53] <%Afterman_> do not play other m
[1:09:56] <Shad0wTag> @ryuuaoi no
[1:09:57] <%RyuuAoi> Lol
[1:10:02] <eriksdrums> I'm going to call THIS Mother Brain "AM"
[1:10:03] <+Superspider51> do it then suffer with us
[1:10:03] <%Deft_Thought> Someone needs to add the Alex Jones "Come on over here you coward!" line to the E.M.M.I.s when they chase you
[1:10:04] <%RyuuAoi> But I have two copies
[1:10:07] <+alphonseisbest> @RyuuAoi yes LUL
[1:10:15] <pet_purple_panda> @RyuuAoi burn them
[1:10:17] <%Afterman_> bury them like they did the ET game
[1:10:19] <hollumdusk> It's  fine as a game, but you need to be able to endure the Cringe
[1:10:23] <pet_purple_panda> with fire
[1:10:24] <Rostichenburg> Trying to look at doors on the map is a pain same with individual blocks
[1:10:24] <+eldrinos> do not play other m. it's okay. you don't need that negativity in your life.
[1:10:25] <Shad0wTag> Zero Mission, Fusion, Samus Returns and The Prime Trilogy and your good
[1:10:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @deft_thought that would be god tier
[1:10:41] <DevilHands_> Just the right amount of trolling
[1:10:45] <%jonblnt> jonblnt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Glad I could catch the surprise stream. Dread looks good can‚Äôt wait to play it
[1:10:53] <%Afterman_> the x parasites are turnin the friggin frogs gay
[1:11:31] <%ladomania> ladomania subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! game good
[1:11:37] <Rostichenburg> Skipping Super is a shame it's the most exploration filled Metroid that's not a mess like the original
[1:11:37] <brachydios777> I feel a missed opprotunity for the federation game was to make it survival horror
[1:11:46] <%RyuuAoi> BOSS
[1:11:52] <drunken_lemur> Energy Doughnuts!
[1:11:53] <%Afterman_> its a baby mother brain
[1:11:58] <+thelovingfool> missles wools lol
[1:12:02] <Jrocy247> These patterns....They seem....Familiar
[1:12:05] <%Afterman_> you cant break the turrets
[1:12:05] <+CalderGaming> spend missiles~
[1:12:06] <Qsmash_> the mother brain cheerios...
[1:12:06] <Rostichenburg> Did Woolie get the tutorial about missiles being for robots?
[1:12:07] <double_zr_tap> missiles
[1:12:09] <Calek> "a little"
[1:12:14] <+StarPhoenix108> Missiles!!!
[1:12:14] <Rain_Mage> it's pulsating
[1:12:16] <brachydios777> Daughter Brain
[1:12:16] <%illtima> Oh wow, those rings look like you'd want to pick them up
[1:12:33] <%Afterman_> the fire rings you can destroy for hp/missile if you need
[1:12:34] <%Deft_Thought> Man, the Federation is on some bullshit
[1:12:35] <pet_purple_panda> Other Brain
[1:12:42] <+alphonseisbest> mmmmuhter brain
[1:12:45] <Jrocy247> Child Brain
[1:12:47] <%MegadBlitz> Other B
[1:12:49] <+xerotwo> Bebe brain Kappa
[1:12:49] <eriksdrums> Uh oh spaghettios
[1:12:50] <mield916> why no use missle
[1:12:54] <Qsmash_> flaming hot cheerios
[1:12:56] <%RyuuAoi> THERE WE GO
[1:12:58] <+samuraicaveman> @Deft_Thought this is Chozo tech, not the fed
[1:13:04] <Rostichenburg> I don't think the Feds built these just the Emmis
[1:13:07] <%NovaKnightmare> EYEEE
[1:13:10] <+CalderGaming> is it ever mentioned in the games that Mother Brain originated from the Chozo, or is that just the manga?
[1:13:14] <+scwry> now you are the hunter
[1:13:22] <Estuko> monkaS
[1:13:22] <%Afterman_> the motherbrains were all made by chozos with the exception of the other m one i thought?
[1:13:24] <linSP> I always wondered what even were those spaghettios mother brain throws at you
[1:13:26] <Rostichenburg> Manga and maybe Other M

[1:13:31] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought I thought this thing was a part of the E.M.M.I. design?
[1:13:33] <%RyuuAoi> Slowly but SURLY
[1:13:38] <Carlioo> @Deft_Thought nah the fed made the EMMI and these zones
[1:13:39] <brachydios777> Mother Brain is Chozo tech
[1:13:44] <%Deft_Thought> Like a control unit for it that gets sent to the planet
[1:13:45] <ShoggothLord> The Central Units are Federation tech from Prime 3
[1:13:50] <$Lunaar> @Afterman_ the GF adapted their own versions called "Aurora Units"
[1:13:53] <hollumdusk> @Afterman_ The Aurora Units in Corruption were kind of a Federation attempt at Mother Brain still
[1:13:56] <el_biribon> did woolie said this was gonna be a full playtru or not?
[1:13:56] <$Lunaar> but they are ultimately Chozo
[1:13:57] <%Afterman_> nah these control units handle the planet i think
[1:13:58] <$Lunaar> LOL welp
[1:14:01] <%Prevot> the fact that there's mother brains here shows that it was chozo tech
[1:14:04] <%Afterman_> they just happen to have the energy to kill an emmi

[1:15:30] <+alphonseisbest> welp
[1:15:30] <pi_in_the_sci> The face needs to shatter
[1:15:30] <+thelovingfool> do it like the door
[1:15:30] <Rostichenburg> It takes a lot of shots to overheat
[1:15:31] <pet_purple_panda> hot dog
[1:15:31] <brachydios777> Also it makes sense they give the omega canon since they are brains like MB
[1:15:31] <Shardlab> Gotta keep shootin, tex
[1:15:32] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[1:15:33] <Estuko> Wait for actual shatter
[1:15:33] <hollumdusk> You have to tries to the parry, remember that.
[1:15:35] <+Evendrag> you have to do it more
[1:15:36] <%RyuuAoi> Game NOT for babies, Woolie

[1:15:42] <+megaman_sentinel> hold?
[1:15:43] <%Revan175757> HOLD fire, don't tap it!
[1:15:48] <halfmasks> you didnt break it
[1:15:53] <%ennui_on_me> the emmi takes longer to break
[1:15:56] <%Deft_Thought> I like that Samus braces herself
[1:15:59] <TheSaltminer> it'll tell you when to stop firing and charge
[1:16:01] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you gotta hit it's face for a while before it breaks
[1:16:04] <+CalderGaming> the door breaks way faster than its face
[1:16:07] <Shardlab> Just hose em
[1:16:13] <%Prevot> killing some of these Emilys is real tough
[1:16:27] <Darren716> NotLikeThis

[1:17:05] <ShoggothLord> This is embarassing
[1:17:08] <kentrix11> It wasn't stunned.
[1:17:11] <eriksdrums> That's fine, no one defeats Samus THREE times in a row!
[1:17:18] <ShoggothLord> I though you liked Metroid, Woolie
[1:17:19] <+coward_man> it shows you the effect to watch for though
[1:17:19] <brachydios777> We learning
[1:17:22] <+alphonseisbest> now ya know LUL
[1:17:22] <DevilHands_> Love the learning process
[1:17:23] <+superchronicc> its just a place holder that you have to melt its face off first
[1:17:24] <redwidow1358> Yeah you can only touch it after a counter, that stuns them. Any other time you touch them is basically death.
[1:17:37] <Rostichenburg> It did look like it was stunned though they should have been clearer
[1:17:38] <+HollowMan190> wait wat
[1:17:41] <%dylheim93> embarrising my ass we all learnt it the hard way XD
[1:17:45] <hollumdusk> @eriksdrums Except Phatoon in Super... the first Dark Souls run of shame of my life!

[1:28:01] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Hard boss or bad fight deign

[1:28:58] <+Weeewer> you get a lot of missiles back from bosses so you're good
[1:29:03] <%Afterman_> i will say the more you play the easier the aiming gets. i had trouble for a while
[1:29:04] <pi_in_the_sci> the tail doesn't need charge shots
[1:29:08] <hollumdusk> Remeber back in super when she had JUST underwear under her armor? Different times back then
[1:29:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:29:09] <ashenchevalierthesecond> I haven't played Dread but those green projectiles look like they'd drop ammo
[1:29:11] <pet_purple_panda> @RyuuAoi she a pretty lady that can kick my ass... and I'd be okay with that
[1:29:11] <+CalderGaming> i dunno there's a certain boss further on that you can tell was not based on a MercurySteam design doc like the rest. not objectively bad combat design but feels out of place
[1:29:17] <%Akizea> rmemeber it's totally cool to spam missiles
[1:29:24] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda baffled the game doesn't let you rebind controls in anyway
[1:29:26] <+scwry> @CalderGaming is it a bug
[1:29:29] <+Weeewer> @CalderGaming aquatic?

[1:31:38] <Rahvith> Samus been watching too much anime
[1:31:39] <ashenchevalierthesecond> Birdwife!
[1:31:39] <+thelovingfool> instant nut
[1:31:43] <+gyabs> LOOKING is an aggressive action
[1:31:43] <%Prevot> this poor alien never saw it coming
[1:31:43] <solracc25> This is mine now
[1:31:43] <DSD24> Samus was always cool
[1:31:45] <+NickHatesSnow> SHE'S STILL GOT IT
[1:31:45] <+KaosMachina> STEALTH MODE ACTIVE
[1:31:46] <+megaman_sentinel> style meter just went up
[1:31:47] <hollumdusk> That was just a dumb animal, not eve a Pirate! Chill Samus!
[1:31:47] <Estuko> Gaslight gatekeep girlboss
[1:31:52] <+HollowMan190> GET ON
[1:31:53] <DXLelouch24> the Queen Has Returned to put to rest the pretenders
[1:31:54] <majindusto> OTHER M...THIS IS NOT
[1:31:55] <+PA_august> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna end your whole generation.‚Äù - Samus
[1:31:56] <%ZweihanderSteve> YARE YARE DAZE
[1:31:56] <%Afterman_> samus is true girlboss
[1:31:58] <heartlesshealer> casually walk to the side while charging
[1:32:04] <freefa> the slow walk with the charged shot...
[1:32:07] <%dylheim93> goddamn superhero
[1:32:08] <%RyuuAoi> F A S I O N
[1:32:11] <Cpt_phantom> That was sick
[1:32:11] <Shad0wTag> GASLIGHT, GIRLKEEP AN GIRLBOSS
[1:32:11] <Blank9> charging without lifting her arm is so good
[1:32:14] <Jrocy247> THANK GOD Other M is deleted from this Universe
[1:32:17] <%RyuuAoi> F A S H I O N
[1:32:17] <WarKamex> woolies hot and bothered by samus
[1:32:26] <+scwry> nintendo decided they needed a cool character
[1:32:26] <%Afterman_> woolie changing pants brb stream
[1:32:28] <%MegadBlitz> who wouldn't be
[1:32:31] <%Afterman_> too much judgment nut
[1:32:31] <BurdRightsActivist> @Jrocy247 Are you sure about that? 4Head
[1:32:32] <Rostichenburg> It tries so hard to make you forget Other M
[1:32:32] <pet_purple_panda> @WarKamex aint we all
[1:32:35] <hollumdusk> It gets better later on the second boss, where she proves that SHE is the actual boss
[1:32:38] <majindusto> Other M is still canon tho lol
[1:32:38] <heartlesshealer> gotta free those guns
[1:32:42] <DevilHands_> I love the approach to making Samus for this game was "Not Other M in any way lol"
[1:32:42] <+thelovingfool> samus is always in control
[1:32:45] <%RyuuAoi> Looking good and feeling fine! Looking good and fine! Looking good and feeling fine! SLAY,
[1:32:53] <+Weeewer> Great first boss right Woolie?
[1:32:55] <%ChoculaUltra> gamer juice acquired
[1:32:56] <DSD24> The look
[1:32:57] <Shad0wTag> @majindusto this game doesn't seem to be acknowledging it
[1:33:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MOTIVATED
[1:33:01] <Jrocy247> @BurdRightsActivist No, But we can move
[1:33:02] <+extradopeness> nice shirt
[1:33:07] <%Afterman_> we should all try to be as cool as samus
[1:33:21] <Onatamana> So Samus' moveset in the next smash is going to be way different, right?
[1:33:25] <Rostichenburg> There
[1:33:26] <%MegadBlitz> didn't Adam die in other M? ADAM is a result of that
[1:33:34] <%ChoculaUltra> that would be so fucking cool
[1:33:35] <hollumdusk> @DevilHands_ To be fair, if you cut the cut scenes in Other M, and leave just Samus battle animation, it was the start of this. It's just it all got buried on  the cut scenes
[1:33:35] <solracc25> New meter
[1:33:35] <DSD24> She's standing ther
[1:33:38] <%xeros720> she should charge her beam too
[1:33:46] <pet_purple_panda> AND IT CHARGES THE BEAM
[1:33:49] <%ChoculaUltra> or just the one handed beam charge animation
[1:33:56] <heartlesshealer> optic camo hell yeah
[1:33:58] <Rostichenburg> There's nothing to really mention from Other M it had no real lasting impact except to show how Adam died
[1:33:59] <majindusto> This game  acknowledges  Other M with Adam...Even if he is now an AI
[1:34:02] <Estuko> It's the same feeling of Vergil charging judgement cut while slowly walking forward
[1:34:05] <ShoggothLord> Samus is now a Predator
[1:34:08] <+DatAsuna> @DevilHands_ It was also nice to have scanning and some non side scrolling rooms
[1:34:11] <%Deft_Thought> So what's Aeion? That been introduced in the lore before?
[1:34:11] <+Superspider51> @majindusto Adam was from Fusion first
[1:34:25] <Rostichenburg> Aeion is from Samus Returns
[1:34:25] <Calek> @Deft_Thought it was in Samus Returns on 3ds
[1:34:27] <@Solidus_113> remember to turn that shit OFF
[1:34:33] <%Deft_Thought> @Calek Ah word
[1:34:35] <+CalderGaming> @Deft_Thought retconned into Metroid 2 in Samus Returns
[1:34:42] <majindusto> Fusion  references  the Adam  from  Other M  tho
[1:34:42] <+Superspider51> @Deft_Thought It was a substance found on SR388 seemingly a byproduct of the Metroids and X in Samus Returns
[1:34:43] <Blank9> it recharges so fast
[1:34:46] <hollumdusk> Also, slight spoilers, but the in game gallery, also acknowledge Other M.
[1:34:54] <+Superspider51> @majindusto Fusion came out nearly a decade before Other M
[1:34:56] <+extradopeness> So is that blood all on the floor of this room?
[1:35:01] <%TheLemuroid> It also set up a meter
[1:35:02] <%Deft_Thought> @ShoggothLord The Dread in the title is for Dreadlocks because PREDATOR
[1:35:06] <+Weeewer> maybe maybe
[1:35:06] <ediblemold> Yes, it has happened to me...
[1:35:10] <Rostichenburg> Aieon existed before the Metroids it's one of the reasons the Chozo colonised SR388
[1:35:14] <Darren716> Yeah have fun with the EMMIs
[1:35:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> yup me to
[1:35:18] <%Prevot> boy I've had that...
[1:35:28] <majindusto> Yes it came before...But still
[1:35:28] <%ennui_on_me> the final emmi did that for me
[1:35:31] <%tank7013> Yea I've been there. Some of the EMMI are shitheads
[1:35:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> And no recharge until you take a step
[1:35:36] <Onatamana> So many times I found myself huddled in the corner watching my energy dwindle.
[1:35:40] <%Prevot> some of these EMMIs don't fucking play
[1:35:42] <+Weeewer> Especially because you CAN do all actions except run while Aoen'd so you can fight while in it if you don't care about your health draining
[1:35:54] <+extradopeness> or just some LCL fluid
[1:35:58] <Rostichenburg> It recharges with a kinetic battery like Snake Eater
[1:36:05] <%ChoculaUltra> the EMMIs have been pushing my shit in FeelsBadMan
[1:36:08] <majindusto> Fusion references  the Adam  we would  eventually  see in Other M
[1:36:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[1:36:12] <solracc25> You can stand still
[1:36:15] <Rain_Mage> It decreases at a slower rate if your not moving
[1:36:26] <hollumdusk> The EMMIs will heard you as soon as you run out of it, though
[1:36:37] <+Weeewer> yeah its balanced around risk
[1:36:50] <Onatamana> Your stealth meter literally charges by being a noisy asshole
[1:36:52] <majindusto> DO IT COWARD
[1:36:53] <DSD24> Pulling a parry off against the EMMI feels so good
[1:36:56] <+cavefishes> does this run at stable 60 docked?
[1:36:58] <solracc25> Loud sweating
[1:36:59] <DSD24> Super hard though
[1:37:15] <Calek> @cavefishes it dips when the effects get gnarly but otherwise pretty darn good
[1:37:17] <@Solidus_113> it's pretty stable. I think I've only seen a couple frame drops in the lava zone
[1:37:22] <+Weeewer> i did somewhere between 10-20 Emmi parries, an many more deaths
[1:37:26] <%Prevot> ige had some frame drops at a few spots
[1:37:26] <hollumdusk> @cavefishes Both docked and unlocked, just a slight drop on very specific and rare moments.
[1:37:27] <@Solidus_113> and cutscenes are locked at 30
[1:37:31] <+cavefishes> good to know, thanks!
[1:37:33] <%RyTYoung> Oh snap! didn't get any notification about the stream NotLikeThis
[1:37:38] <hollumdusk> Cut Scenes are just 30 frames though
[1:37:42] <majindusto> You'll get iteventually...It's  Tricky  tho
[1:37:50] <+extradopeness> shortcuts
[1:37:59] <%RyuuAoi> @rytyoung Twitch be a bitch sometimes. I'm glad you came!
[1:38:01] <DevilHands_> yeup
[1:38:05] <%RyTYoung> I'm loving this game so far, I think I'm close to the end and it feels so good to play!
[1:38:11] <+scwry> I find free aim fixes that
[1:38:17] <%Prevot> honestly better to free aim than crouch shoot
[1:38:17] <@Solidus_113> you wanna know some real pain? try jumping and going to a crouch shot
[1:38:18] <Blank9> ZL crouches I think?
[1:38:21] <+Weeewer> this game might be my goty
[1:38:22] <@Solidus_113> you just shoot at your feet
[1:38:23] <Saltmeisterr> why don't control sticks use notches anymore
[1:38:28] <majindusto> Woolie...Did you ever play Samus  Returns?
[1:38:31] <Uselesswhitenoise> Dread is such a good metroid
[1:38:31] <Darren716> Morph ball is super late in this game, it's nuts
[1:38:33] <%RyTYoung> @ryuuaoi thanks dude gigaboOtsMEOW
[1:38:34] <%ennui_on_me> yeah this game makes you *wait* for that ball
[1:38:37] <hollumdusk> This game will make you go THIRSTY for that Morph Ball!
[1:38:37] <pet_purple_panda> @Saltmeisterr this is a switch game
[1:38:38] <+Weeewer> its up there with Returnal and Great Ace Attorney for me
[1:38:42] <Rostichenburg> I've been dying for a second Hard mode playthrough ever since I got 100% a couple hours ago
[1:38:45] <Monkeyweed21> morph is delayed gratification in this game
[1:38:46] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Gonna make you sweat! Babby!
[1:38:48] <solracc25> that elusive ball
[1:38:51] <Saltmeisterr> @Saltmeisterr what
[1:38:54] <+thelovingfool> its euphoria when you get morph
[1:38:55] <Saltmeisterr> lol
[1:38:57] <+extradopeness> zl is slide but it does crouch when standing still
[1:39:03] <+Bearborg> @Blank9 ZL is slide/morph, it actually skips past crouching straight into morph if you press it neutral
[1:39:04] <Uselesswhitenoise> What if they made a Metroid where you never got morphball. that would be FUcked Up
[1:39:04] <%jinking79> the tease for morphball
[1:39:05] <+Superspider51> Adam only talks when he authorizes it @WoolieVersus
[1:39:12] <%tank7013> They did a great job making you ultra thirsty for such a basic and expected upgrade
[1:39:13] <majindusto> NO TIME TO BALL
[1:39:17] <hollumdusk> @Uselesswhitenoise Federation Force?
[1:39:19] <+Weeewer> @thelovingfool the deeper euphoria was the gravity suit they freaking make you beg for it
[1:39:27] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Oooh it's Metread , Nice!
[1:39:27] <+Weeewer> They did a great job teasing the player for certain items
[1:39:28] <%RyuuAoi> Birdman?
[1:39:29] <+thelovingfool> DUD IKR
[1:39:29] <%Deft_Thought> "Whatchu want, Lady. I'm busy" -Adam, probably
[1:39:32] <solracc25> It's good that there are a LOT os save points
[1:39:35] <+extradopeness> need ice beam/missile
[1:39:37] <saiyanblitz> Hello
[1:39:41] <+vaderxyz1970> Gonna need TIMESTOP
[1:39:43] <+Superspider51> I feel my joke went unappreciated
[1:39:44] <+legitimatejohnathan> The anti-backtrack
[1:39:49] <majindusto> What's  a Federation  Force? enigmaKEK
[1:39:59] <%Prevot> Adam's busy playing with the animals or something
[1:40:04] <Rostichenburg> No explanation
[1:40:20] <%RyuuAoi> @prevot Naw. SA-X ate the,
[1:40:27] <%RyuuAoi> them. All
[1:40:30] <pet_purple_panda> @Superspider51 naw we just weren't authorized to respond
[1:40:36] <Rostichenburg> Adam is hanging out trying to deauthorise things
[1:40:42] <+Superspider51> @Superspider51 fair
[1:40:48] <%CAPSLOCKlive> can't wait for Samus to have to learn Blast Ball to progress
[1:40:52] <+scwry> this first area is pretty linear, but they ease up
[1:40:55] <%ennui_on_me> metroid can NOT crawl
[1:40:57] <solracc25> ball
[1:40:58] <spawnzie> if only metroid could ball
[1:40:59] <%tank7013> I love the way Samus braces on the wall and leans into the hole
[1:41:01] <Onatamana> Google tells me that Dread has sold 89 million units and I'm having trouble believing it.
[1:41:05] <+Weeewer> i definitely got lost a few times as the game opens up
[1:41:10] <+CammerTime21> Spy cloak rules
[1:41:12] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie will NEVER ball
[1:41:12] <%tank7013> This game is full of neat animation touches like that
[1:41:14] <Rostichenburg> Samus' chest is too big to crawl head first
[1:41:15] <majindusto> Metroid  can't  Crawl enigmaKEK
[1:41:16] <%Deft_Thought> You can (NOT) crawl
[1:41:22] <Calek> @Onatamana yeah that's a lie, think that's switch console sales, if you read further
[1:41:24] <+alphonseisbest> @Onatamana Its sold six, as of pre order numbers
[1:41:38] <solracc25> Samus is hard on that "physical amnesia"
[1:41:42] <+extradopeness> freeze ice huh
[1:41:44] <%MegadBlitz> too many crawl spaces
[1:41:51] <%Prevot> damn only 6 units sold huh
[1:41:51] <+Beetlewins> Google says 89 million about the switch
[1:41:57] <Calek> six whole copies hot damn
[1:42:02] <+Beetlewins> Metroid Dread's platform, the Nintendo Switch, also happens to be one of the most successful video game consoles of all time, having sold 89 million units
[1:42:04] <%Prevot> that's metroid for ya
[1:42:08] <+Take_2_shots> Will Woolie figure it out?
[1:42:08] <hollumdusk> @Onatamana Six would be crazy, that would be more than double the best selling Metroid game in just a couple of days!
[1:42:08] <+CalderGaming> No, You Cannot
[1:42:11] <Darren716> Nah you had it, it's a bit later
[1:42:11] <+alphonseisbest> LUL yes chat 6 whole copies
[1:42:12] <+Weeewer> if something has "???" on it you cannot clear it yet
[1:42:14] <%ennui_on_me> this game really loves to lock backtracking for a bit
[1:42:20] <Rostichenburg> I hope the adoption rate for Dread is 1:1
[1:42:25] <+vaderxyz1970> you need timestop
[1:42:28] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Basic videogame progression : Red thing = Hit it with blue thing
[1:42:30] <Riettler> Covid sales really beefed this cycle's consoles
[1:42:30] <+CalderGaming> it is sneakily linear for a good while
[1:42:31] <+scwry> I think its good they lock backtracking here, its only the first area
[1:42:40] <Darren716> Honestly most the back tracking I just saved until I had absolutely everything
[1:42:51] <%ChoculaUltra> I love the "oh, I get it" moments of the game
[1:42:52] <pi_in_the_sci> remember the whole goal is up
[1:42:56] <%ennui_on_me> @Darren716 same
[1:42:59] <CryHavoc_12> I guess we need a morphbal l
[1:43:00] <Rostichenburg> Getting everything first really ruins a lot of the puzzles though
[1:43:04] <Darren716> Blind
[1:43:05] <+extradopeness> yeah once you have timestop you MAYBE have a chance with birdperson
[1:43:07] <+Weeewer> oof
[1:43:08] <hollumdusk> Honestly, by the time optional backtracking was open for me, I was to invested on the game to ignore the main path
[1:43:09] <+thelovingfool> it was right there wools
[1:43:11] <%RyuuAoi> Maps are way bigger in this one. Overwhelming if you've got the goblins.
[1:43:11] <+Bearborg> blind
[1:43:17] <Darren716> The blue lines are cloak doors
[1:43:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:43:19] <$brave_sj> There's a sensor door by the lava zone there
[1:43:20] <+StarPhoenix108> sensor door
[1:43:20] <%ennui_on_me> Like what's the point of scraping through the first area over and over when I'll have to go back every time I get an upgrade again
[1:43:26] <Jrocy247> The backtracking in this game is insane
[1:43:29] <Rostichenburg> Maps are way bigger but Samus sprints through everything
[1:43:32] <%ennui_on_me> idk metroidvanias aren't really for my brain
[1:43:34] <hollumdusk> I really want to fight Bidgil, and I think I am getting close
[1:43:38] <%MegadBlitz> guys he's not blind, the progression is just cloaked
[1:43:42] <@Menitta> I felt this game has a bunch of shootable walls
[1:43:43] <AzureSynesthesia> the artaria 3rd theme is so good
[1:43:45] <Chichen> Hey woolie, try the "highlight icons" button
[1:43:47] <%tank7013> Oh these things. I hate these things
[1:43:50] <+Weeewer> yatta
[1:43:50] <+scwry> got it :)
[1:43:51] <%BisoromiBear> woolieSMUG_SG
[1:43:57] <%CAPSLOCKlive> seeing woolie actually learning the game is waaaaay more fun than seeing most content creators driving with chat and guides
[1:44:03] <Rostichenburg> So close
[1:44:05] <+thelovingfool> yeah your speed in this game makes speed boos unnecessary
[1:44:08] <solracc25> lava
[1:44:10] <+Weeewer> not yatta
[1:44:13] <%Prevot> woolie...
[1:44:15] <majindusto> I love that they brought  back the parry from Samus Returns
[1:44:18] <Asuterisuku> this game's environmental design is top notch.
[1:44:23] <DevilHands_> Dont worry chat he'll get it
[1:44:28] <+Weeewer> yatta
[1:44:28] <+scwry> there we go
[1:44:29] <Monkeyweed21> samus can indeed confirm, fire hot
[1:44:31] <+CalderGaming> @majindusto same devs!
[1:44:45] <+KaosMachina> Still gotta play Samus Returns
[1:44:51] <Rostichenburg> There's so many rooms I missed cause they expect you to back track at arbitrary points
[1:45:01] <%tank7013> If only the Metroid dna from fusion had made her heat resistant
[1:45:02] <drunken_lemur> I'm noticing these aren't X Parasites
[1:45:08] <+Weeewer> hmmm...
[1:45:08] <solracc25> yes impulse save
[1:45:12] <%RyTYoung> That would be really cool
[1:45:14] <$Lunaar> AM2R did it right
[1:45:18] <hollumdusk> Something funny about playing Dread, I keep going "Won't it be great if this devs made a Castlevania game next... oh wait!"
[1:45:20] <BlackermanZX> that would be useful
[1:45:23] <Jrocy247> Yeaaaa, Shooting walls/Floors is VERY unnoticeable
[1:45:25] <Darren716> I'd say play Samus Returns before this, theres quite a few QoL changes in Dread that are absent in Returns
[1:45:27] <+CalderGaming> @hollumdusk LOL yeah
[1:45:29] <$Lunaar> entering a new area, get some lore added to your lore menu
[1:45:30] <+Beetlewins> Didn't the Metroid that can't be named have scanning?
[1:45:33] <%Prevot> it just doesn't fit the flow and controls of 2D
[1:45:36] <Estuko> Yall have fun, movie date
[1:45:39] <+DatAsuna> It would help though since the 2D games are so short
[1:45:42] <%jinking79> gotta leave that to prime sadly
[1:45:45] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Nintendo will only expend the minimun amount of money in their franchises...
[1:45:58] <%RyuuAoi> @rostichenburg Facing the same issue with Super rn. I do t wanna progress until I get everything. AND FUCK YHOSE SECRET WALLS OF PROGRESSION
[1:46:01] <%RyTYoung> Even having enemy logs would be cool
[1:46:01] <%RyuuAoi> don't
[1:46:02] <pet_purple_panda> incorparate scanning via parry
[1:46:09] <+alphonseisbest> @hollumdusk LUL yea we don't talk about MS's castilvania games
[1:46:16] <+KaosMachina> Woolie, do you want a Scanner, or do you just want a bestiary and some collectible lore like in a Castlevania
[1:46:19] <+extradopeness> yeah the intro said X were here on ZDR but so far these are normal monsters
[1:46:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Like DOOM 2016
[1:46:28] <+DatAsuna> Like you're already a bit under a third of the way through
[1:46:29] <demiiluna> Speaking of lazy BOY HOW ABOUT THAT 10FPS FIRE
[1:46:29] <%RyuuAoi> I'd love a scanner tbh
[1:46:31] <DevilHands_> Kill a certain number then you get an entry
[1:46:35] <+KaosMachina> or like in God of War
[1:46:36] <AzureSynesthesia> i guess the way hollow knight's hunting log works
[1:46:37] <DevilHands_> something like that
[1:46:40] <+DatAsuna> The closest thing you get is talking to adam at the network stations
[1:46:45] <+FrostySoftServe> AM2R did somethiing like that with the scans
[1:46:51] <Darren716> Woolie the doors warn you lol
[1:46:53] <%RyuuAoi> Just some lore after 10+ years would be nice.
[1:46:53] <majindusto> TOO HOT
[1:46:54] <+thelovingfool> IT WAS PAIN
[1:46:55] <%ChoculaUltra> hot room is hot monkaS
[1:46:58] <+CalderGaming> woolie you can see the heat glow coming through the door
[1:47:00] <%Sparkseid> fire indeed hot
[1:47:02] <Monkeyweed21> behind door #3 is DEATH
[1:47:05] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Parry kill = Lore reward would be cool. Incentive to get good while not holding you back for it
[1:47:07] <@Menitta> One thing I dont like about Prime scanning is how the logs of some stuff and enemies are like "This creature exists to be a platforming obstacle"
[1:47:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> If only heat had a glow
[1:47:08] <BlackermanZX> yeee cataris time
[1:47:09] <+Weeewer> this game is so genius at showing you all the things you CANT do and teasing you constantly
[1:47:10] <%Prevot> love this animation
[1:47:13] <Rostichenburg> That elevator went low
[1:47:14] <+DatAsuna> nice loading screen
[1:47:15] <%Sparkseid> nevet
[1:47:16] <solracc25> doors have heat outside
[1:47:16] <%MegadBlitz> it was a ruse birdman lured samus here so she could heal her wounds and get strong
[1:47:16] <pet_purple_panda> aww yeah that load
[1:47:18] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus BEST LOAD SCREEN
[1:47:18] <+pupil31> Kreygasm
[1:47:19] <+Mkingston> been playing this all day. so good.
[1:47:19] <+Take_2_shots> Deep in the Samus Cave
[1:47:21] <+CalderGaming> you CAN'T skip it it's a loading screen
[1:47:22] <KeiPrime> you wish you could skip it
[1:47:25] <Rostichenburg> This loads are so long
[1:47:25] <%RyTYoung> The fire jets are the only thing I can say doesn't look great, but I can look by it is such a nitpick
[1:47:26] <+KaosMachina> do you think catarsis will be catartic
[1:47:27] <KeiPrime> its loading screen
[1:47:28] <KeiPrime> and its long
[1:47:29] <+StarPhoenix108> After you get off the elevator shoot left
[1:47:29] <spawnzie> Good ass load screens in this game
[1:47:30] <majindusto> BEAUTIFUL
[1:47:40] <+StarPhoenix108> shoot left
[1:47:40] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Make that load screen your screen saver!
[1:47:40] <+thelovingfool> this game is loadscrean animation porn
[1:47:41] <Rostichenburg> The PS5 killed my desire to see these long loads
[1:47:43] <%CAPSLOCKlive> just remember that under those heavy boots we have Samus in Jet Heels
[1:47:44] <roughday25> this part tripped me up for a sec
[1:47:46] <solracc25> best loading
[1:47:51] <+pupil31> SourPls
[1:47:56] <+Mkingston> SSDs will be the downfall of Metroid
[1:47:57] <roughday25> because I didn't shoot left first off like woolz did
[1:48:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Katar
[1:48:04] <Calek> @StarPhoenix108 he's a big boy metroid vet, just let him play
[1:48:06] <OfficerMods> woolie is playing this game 5 years ahead of schedule? On god?
[1:48:09] <KeiPrime> kyle katarn
[1:48:10] <%MegadBlitz> man i love the elevator screen but i kinda wish there was a small chance samus did something while waiting
[1:48:13] <Inqy833> Samus can punch now? Hehe
[1:48:27] <+secondkoan> @Mkingston Metroid: Soild State Drive sounds like a legit spinoff title.
[1:48:31] <+BlackMegaMan> If there is anything that this game does exceptionally well is that it makes Samus look like the biggest baddest coolest Badass in the galaxy
[1:48:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @officermods Wools likes to keep God guessing LUL
[1:48:39] <Uselesswhitenoise> you can parry that guy
[1:48:41] <Darren716> LUL
[1:48:42] <roughday25> or one counter~?
[1:48:50] <+CalderGaming> the glow tho
[1:48:51] <%ennui_on_me> red glow means hot woolie
[1:48:52] <+Mkingston> @inqy833 Since Samus Returns which was made by the same team as this.
[1:48:54] <Rostichenburg> Need to get the attack counter down
[1:48:55] <+thelovingfool> bitch you thought
[1:48:56] <Darren716> Look for the glow
[1:48:58] <majindusto> BURNING!!!
[1:48:58] <solracc25> van counter
[1:49:05] <%aogman> aogman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! sick
[1:49:06] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Parry has a nice window to it

[1:49:17] <slix3431> Woolie how Cool is Samus?

[1:49:37] <pi_in_the_sci> parry
[1:49:45] <+thelovingfool> missle drops are generous so never not use them tbh
[1:49:45] <%RyuuAoi> Missles
[1:49:50] <+megaman_sentinel> the flash
[1:49:52] <+rbakervv> @WoolieVersus that was a parry flash woolie
[1:49:54] <slix3431> Samus has the greatest weapon in the galaxy
[1:49:59] <+Beetlewins> spam them missiles
[1:50:00] <Rostichenburg> The Baby gigaboOtsbbrahab
[1:50:04] <BlackermanZX> robot has a parry flash
[1:50:05] <+Mkingston> I played through Samus Returns recently. the parry timing has changed and it completely fucked me for the first 2 hours.
[1:50:15] <Uselesswhitenoise> hey adam
[1:50:19] <+Rican20v> How many bosses have we beat chat?
[1:50:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:50:19] <+KaosMachina> time to talk to boyfriend siri
[1:50:21] <%RyuuAoi> But to be fair, you never use missles on bitch tier enemies.
[1:50:29] <+pupil31> It's the disco ball from SMT Poggers
[1:50:34] <%ennui_on_me> @Rican20v 1
[1:50:42] <+CalderGaming> @RyuuAoi you can though, with the rate you get ammo back
[1:50:47] <%RyuuAoi> @rican20v I wanna say 2-3
[1:50:50] <+scwry> Really appreciate how adam doesnt tell you where to go, like he does in fusion
[1:50:54] <slix3431> Parry the lava
[1:50:56] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Nintendo saved on VA and went with Text to Speech. Okay...
[1:51:02] <+KaosMachina> man, Adam is so lame now, he doesn't even send you into lava areas pre-varia suit
[1:51:03] <solracc25> baby suit
[1:51:04] <demiiluna> Remember woolie UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you enter high temperature areas.
[1:51:11] <AzureSynesthesia> @RyuuAoi indeed, this game seems to encourage using missiles all the time based on how much you get from parries
[1:51:11] <%RyuuAoi> @caldergaming THE GOBLINS THO
[1:51:12] <+extradopeness> no call her LADY
[1:51:13] <Chichen> :)
[1:51:13] <%ekodrop> adam sounds like he has a cold
[1:51:13] <majindusto> SHUT UP ROBO DAD.
[1:51:16] <Rostichenburg> Adam really changed when he became an AI
[1:51:19] <@Menitta> any objections lady
[1:51:28] <+scwry> Adams emotionless voice adds a lot to the isolation of the planet
[1:51:33] <+CalderGaming> @scwry yeah it makes sense. you had the station layout in fusion, but any map info you would have received for ZDR was lost when the EMMIs went dark
[1:51:42] <Inqy833> Computer Adam is way better than fleshy Adam ever was.
[1:51:45] <Iwashi94> I didn't understand why this gets tutorialized here when they already had a popup about how the invis works
[1:51:45] <%Prevot> I love the way they do his voice
[1:51:52] <+thelovingfool> same
[1:51:53] <majindusto> YOURE NOT THE BOSS OF ME
[1:51:59] <Rostichenburg> I hate this effect really hurts my ears
[1:52:01] <brunoberserk> so magic pixel ?
[1:52:03] <unrelenting0> @Iwashi94 Because sometimes people mash past the tutorial.
[1:52:04] <Parapattern> Thanks, Soundwave Adam
[1:52:06] <+rbakervv> @Iwashi94 for people who skipped right past it, without reading
[1:52:10] <%RyuuAoi> Ngl this Adam throws me off but it makes sense.
[1:52:13] <%Prevot> @iwashi94 if you've seen some of the reactions people have had to this game you'd know why
[1:52:14] <+extradopeness> He sounds exactly the way i always thought he would
[1:52:15] <BurdRightsActivist> no, thank god
[1:52:19] <BlackermanZX> @iwashi94 because people are dumb
[1:52:20] <roughday25> it really is a good voice direction
[1:52:20] <scaryboisupreme> Adam functions weirdly. He does the other M thing of explaining what we already know
[1:52:21] <$Lunaar> I always thought it was like VEGA from Doom 2016
[1:52:23] <%ChoculaUltra> He should've sounded like Bender
[1:52:25] <$Lunaar> but I dig it
[1:52:25] <Daxalog> If you like the EMMI play Rain World. The whole game is like EMMI with no safe zones.
[1:52:26] <%MegadBlitz> love its a new voice
[1:52:30] <+CalderGaming> @Iwashi94 you've seen some streamers right? you know how bad they are at absorbing tutorial info, right?
[1:52:31] <majindusto> Soundwave Adam enigmaKEK
[1:52:33] <%CAPSLOCKlive> i would imagine the Future where Samus leave they would have better AI voices
[1:52:38] <@Menitta> I'd prefer something like the pods in Nier
[1:52:44] <+scwry> him just being a computer makes you feel more alone
[1:52:47] <Rostichenburg> @Daxalog That kills any desire I had to play that
[1:52:48] <+Mkingston> Stephen Hawking Adam
[1:52:49] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus I envisioned ADAM sounding like AM
[1:52:57] <BurdRightsActivist> Virgin Fleshadam, Chad Hawking Adam
[1:53:03] <solracc25> they love that
[1:53:12] <kragor__> this game rules
[1:53:22] <+Mkingston> @ryuuaoi HAAATE
[1:53:31] <+KaosMachina> oh boy, hope you're excited to see your life bar drain as an EMMI stares at you
[1:53:37] <%Prevot> reminder that Adam dies for nothing cause the federation just started making metroid again right after
[1:53:40] <BurdRightsActivist> hearing that stock fire sfx
[1:53:46] <Rostichenburg> Seems weird that her suit also has a Siri in it
[1:53:54] <slix3431> Samus is basically a god now
[1:53:59] <+scwry> game over YEAAA
[1:54:01] <solracc25> oh no
[1:54:06] <Rostichenburg> Soft locked
[1:54:08] <slix3431> Blowing up planets is old for her
[1:54:08] <+extradopeness> this game really is 10/10
[1:54:11] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Imagine Samus going to a Planet where everything is USB C and her suit is Micro USB only. So lucky everything is compatible with her Cannon arm
[1:54:17] <+CammerTime21> there are no softlocks
[1:54:22] <Chichen> IF ONLY
[1:54:23] <+thelovingfool> missles woolie
[1:54:27] <+scwry> break free
[1:54:28] <Darren716> This is how Samus' story ends
[1:54:28] <BlackermanZX> if in doubt missile everything
[1:54:29] <Rostichenburg> I don't know this looks like a soft lock to me
[1:54:39] <+Superspider51> @Rostichenburg there are no soft locks
[1:54:40] <heartlesshealer> there are no softlocks
[1:54:43] <%Prevot> all thanks to the EU making chozo arm cannon plugs the default standard
[1:54:49] <slix3431> QA is never over
[1:55:01] <$brave_sj> @Superspider51 Woolie will find a way
[1:55:07] <+scwry> missiles are plentiful
[1:55:08] <%RyuuAoi> It's fine, Woolie
[1:55:10] <AzureSynesthesia> they give you a lot of missiles back when parrying
[1:55:17] <slix3431> Woolie will figure it out
[1:55:19] <+giant_impact> metriod boyz making noise
[1:55:20] <Rostichenburg> There's recharge stations everywhere and enemies drop tons
[1:55:21] <essence_of_lariatto> this game gives missiles like crazy, go nutz
[1:55:21] <+thelovingfool> missles are the most generous theyve ever been in this game @WoolieVersus
[1:55:22] <+HakureiIllusion> This game in particular wants you to use a ton of missiles and restocks you constantly
[1:55:24] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Missiles are Samus's Shotgun
[1:55:25] <Darren716> I mean that was a beam block so you could have just shot it
[1:55:27] <@Solidus_113> every parry is basically a full missle refill
[1:55:28] <Saltmeisterr> they give u alot of missiles in this game
[1:55:30] <%RyTYoung> I had a weird glitch earlier where I got hit in a save room from thin air, it was weird I saved a clip
[1:55:33] <slix3431> Oh parry is rad
[1:55:33] <DoctorMulholland> The game's very generous with missile ammo pickups, especially when you counter enemies.
[1:55:34] <BlackermanZX> dont worry about using missiles
[1:55:38] <solracc25> Some can be with just bullets
[1:55:44] <majindusto> Don't  be Stingy...Missles are piss easy to replenish
[1:55:45] <+DatAsuna> Think of it this way, if you aren't empty whenever you get a refill, that's also wasting missiles
[1:55:46] <slix3431> That was the first parry I saw and it was nice
[1:55:46] <BlackermanZX> dont let the goblins control you
[1:55:57] <+scwry> cool room
[1:56:01] <Rostichenburg> What if Woolie needs those missiles for later?!
[1:56:08] <+thelovingfool> oh this room ha
[1:56:10] <+extradopeness> @datasuna preach
[1:56:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> yall keep joking but he WILl need those missiles for later
[1:56:32] <+karldeck> Counter them
[1:56:32] <+KaosMachina> can you deflect it when it pulls the pistons back?
[1:56:34] <%RyuuAoi> Good thing about this game, you don't have to use the missiles! Makes bosses easier but the franchise is consistent.
[1:56:37] <+karldeck> Most effective
[1:56:41] <solracc25> counter the bot
[1:56:42] <Rostichenburg> @KaosMachina Yes
[1:56:45] <+rbakervv> @KaosMachina yep, that's what the flash means
[1:56:48] <+DatAsuna> @FuqBoiSlim except there's plenty of refills between then and now
[1:57:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> @datasuna yeah because you need them duhh
[1:57:19] <slix3431> Woolie is the parry as satisfying as it looks?
[1:57:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:57:44] <+DatAsuna> @slix3431 yes
[1:57:54] <%RyuuAoi> Parry replaces missiles.
[1:57:59] <%ennui_on_me> parry feels so damn good
[1:58:02] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Parry has a generous window of use which is nice
[1:58:15] <Darren716> He's gotta do it every time LUL
[1:58:15] <+scwry> @slix3431 theres also a dash parry thats even more satisfying
[1:58:21] <+extradopeness> spice e

[2:01:11] <%LastHazzerd> @StatesmanPrimal i love the designs in this game so much
[2:01:17] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:01:17] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:01:19] <Rostichenburg> That sounds radius is way too big
[2:01:20] <+KipTheSmuggler> KICK
[2:01:20] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:01:21] <+thelovingfool> yellow just means it hears you
[2:01:24] <%ennui_on_me> cloak does nothing once it's seen you
[2:01:24] <%CAPSLOCKlive> YO
[2:01:27] <majindusto> WELP
[2:01:27] <+KaosMachina> woolie they TOLD YOU THAT YOU CAN'T USE IT WHEN FOUND
[2:01:30] <heartlesshealer> explicitly what adam told you not to do LUL
[2:01:31] <%LastHazzerd> the wiffs are so funny
[2:01:31] <AzureSynesthesia> if its red, cloak doesnt work
[2:01:32] <BlackermanZX> almost parried it
[2:01:32] <@Menitta> The timing is REALLY hard
[2:01:34] <thackattack00> he already forgot the tooltip LUL
[2:01:35] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[2:01:39] <+Superspider51> when the screen is red they'll track you down, you gotta break line of sight
[2:01:40] <solracc25> not on red
[2:01:43] <Inqy833> Yellow means it hears you. Red means it sees you and clocking no longer works.
[2:01:45] <kikoeru_san> turbo poke
[2:01:48] <unrelenting0> And people were wondering why they told us twice.
[2:01:48] <+VictorVonLouche> Run into its face alert then cloak smooth move
[2:01:48] <Rostichenburg> You can use the cloak to cancel out the alert status
[2:01:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> U SURE DID
[2:01:54] <%ChoculaUltra> I heard the EMMI parry window is 4 frames, not sure if true but it feels like it LUL
[2:01:56] <+StatesmanPrimal> @StatesmanPrimal i know somehow they knocked this one out of the park
[2:01:56] <+scwry> LUL
[2:02:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine reading or remembering tutorials
[2:02:06] <+scwry> PogChamp
[2:02:10] <majindusto> FUCKING RUN

[2:02:17] <+VictorVonLouche> @GeneralSCPatton A novel concept for sure
[2:02:22] <+StatesmanPrimal> how would i remember tutorials that's hard
[2:02:30] <Onatamana> I love the mistimed hits during the qtes. Samus is like, 'eh'
[2:02:40] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Green Robot Dog is in the map as a Red Dot, right?
[2:02:46] <%HollowedIdjit> ye
[2:02:47] <Rostichenburg> Yeah
[2:02:51] <+scwry> Nice nice
[2:02:54] <+StatesmanPrimal> ye, they're this big threatening dot
[2:02:56] <heartlesshealer> good job
[2:03:08] <+thelovingfool> remember you can hide when its yellow
[2:03:22] <Rostichenburg> Pressing left on the control pad zooms out the map so you can see the Emmi better
[2:03:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> yeah, if it's red it'll find your ass
[2:04:01] <cranestorm922> Yellow caution and red alert.
[2:04:06] <+VictorVonLouche> trial by fire again
[2:04:15] <majindusto> STILL HOT

[2:05:38] <Louie_Salmon> Follow the pipis
[2:05:41] <brachydios777> Fun fact: Samus' height as of Super Metroid is 6'3 ft
[2:05:49] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus SHOW US YOUR AMIIBO

[2:06:07] <%CAPSLOCKlive> without the suit she is 6,3 ?
[2:06:08] <Rostichenburg> They either shrunk her in Other M or made everyone else super tall
[2:06:09] <+StatesmanPrimal> looking down on my regular sized ass

[2:06:28] <Rostichenburg> @majindusto Yeah but all they give you is health or missiles once a day
[2:06:28] <%RyuuAoi> Samus is a big bitch confirmed
[2:06:32] <+KaosMachina> is this just a mapping thing
[2:06:46] <+extradopeness> hot
[2:06:59] <Rostichenburg> Can't believe he didn't slide into that hot hole
[2:07:01] <+StatesmanPrimal> INDUSTRY
[2:07:05] <%RyuuAoi> @rostichenburg Perfect for boss battles
[2:07:15] <cranestorm922> Sticky elevators.

[2:07:44] <+Superspider51> the doors are like that too
[2:07:48] <majindusto> FINALLY enigmaKEK
[2:07:48] <+Beetlewins> Woolie just constantly burning his hand on the stovetop
[2:07:49] <DoctorMulholland> Look at them this way Woolie, you're marking them on the map for future reference.
[2:07:50] <Rostichenburg> I thought this was a bit
[2:07:53] <justcallmebobplease> BIG BLIND GO UP
[2:07:56] <cranestorm922> Red equals bad, Woolie. koefGecko1 koefGecko2
[2:07:57] <Louie_Salmon> He wants the spicy doors
[2:07:58] <solracc25> big red
[2:07:58] <+scwry> Like a moth to flame
[2:08:04] <+extradopeness> its fine its literally metroid
[2:08:04] <%CAPSLOCKlive> dont Pepsiman it, check yer doors
[2:08:06] <Asuterisuku> It does that for cold areas too
[2:08:11] <BlackermanZX> dont go into the hot salsa
[2:08:22] <+DatAsuna> Don't touch the hot stove, don't put soda cans in the freezer
[2:08:30] <DoctorMulholland> I actually intentionally went into every hot zone just so I'd know where they were on the map when I inevitably got the varia suit.
[2:08:33] <majindusto> ROOM TOO SPICY
[2:08:34] <AstrodropGaming> Looks like the lightbulb turned on LUL
[2:08:40] <Tempmael> How do the movement and controls feel?
[2:08:47] <+thelovingfool> this games got good shortcuts
[2:08:52] <+pupil31> Very light and responsive
[2:08:55] <Asuterisuku> Really, really good
[2:09:08] <Rostichenburg> Very fast
[2:09:08] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Music aint bad at all in this, nicely subdue and moody
[2:09:08] <AzureSynesthesia> @DoctorMulholland the map does indicate if a door is next to a temperature zone even if you dont enter
[2:09:20] <+extradopeness> theres definitely a cold room i ran thru to get an early E-pack(1/4)
[2:09:31] <%RyuuAoi> @capslocklive It gets better!
[2:09:33] <Tempmael> Looks like they learned a lot from the m2 remake, dope
[2:09:42] <+D00msDayDan> he almost figured it out
[2:09:45] <BlackermanZX> you can parry that bot
[2:09:52] <roughday25> so close to the robo parry
[2:09:57] <solracc25> yes that button
[2:09:58] <Rostichenburg> I didn't notice the robot parry until right near the end
[2:09:58] <DoctorMulholland> Yeah there's a little bit of a red aura on the map but I like going in so there's a big glaring red space I can see right at a glance
[2:10:04] <+Superspider51> like metal gear rising, that exact same yellow ring effect means you can parry shit
[2:10:07] <+DatAsuna> @Tempmael yeah they came a long way from the awfulness that was mirror of fate lol
[2:10:22] <@Solidus_113> mystery
[2:10:24] <Rostichenburg> I like bits of Mirror of Fate
[2:10:33] <Monkeyweed21> need triangle
[2:10:39] <+D00msDayDan> if it's ??? you don't have the tool for it yet
[2:11:02] <majindusto> Fire Indeed  Bad
[2:11:03] <cranestorm922> Microwave Hallways. nicobRekt
[2:11:24] <+scwry> the fact mercury steam encourage sequence breaking in this, shows me theyre perfect for metroid
[2:11:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:11:32] <KnivesEve> you... did it
[2:11:33] <roughday25> YES
[2:11:35] <+samuraicaveman> HE DID IT
[2:11:38] <CryHavoc_12> Pog
[2:11:45] <+cermo55> SeemsGood
[2:11:45] <AzureSynesthesia> the non-emmi parrys are super forgiving
[2:11:47] <%MelBrooksKA> !Motivated
[2:11:47] <@Moobot> @MelBrooksKA 2313 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:11:54] <Rostichenburg> It's not real sequence breaking if it's been built into the game
[2:12:03] <Rostichenburg> It's just a different sequence
[2:12:05] <%CAPSLOCKlive> That's the real lore. You parry and then you learn that shit gets parrie
[2:12:15] <Inqy833> Nice
[2:12:20] <roughday25> yessss it feels so chunky
[2:12:21] <Asuterisuku> Follow the pipes!
[2:12:29] <majindusto> PARRY THAT SHIT enigmaPOG
[2:12:34] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Next game Samus will do Roman Cancels
[2:12:36] <cranestorm922> Sequence tapping.
[2:12:37] <%fearlesscoward9> Parries are like one of the best mechanics in games in general lmao
[2:12:39] <%jinking79> he almost understand the spider climbing
[2:12:54] <Inqy833> Watching Samus just punch out a huge metal robot with a satisfying metal *chunk* sound on impact is just... yes!
[2:12:54] <+scwry> the 1 block omg
[2:12:56] <CryHavoc_12> Parry the rain!! PowerUpL CrreamAwk PowerUpR
[2:12:58] <+thelovingfool> so glad they mark items on the map
[2:13:01] <+VictorVonLouche> Wierd not getting morph ball as the first upgrade
[2:13:02] <solracc25> ballz
[2:13:05] <Tempmael> The party is so rewarding
[2:13:11] <Tempmael> *parry
[2:13:34] <Rostichenburg> This looks like a Shadow Complex room
[2:13:35] <%RyuuAoi> @victorvonlouche They gonna make you sweat! Baby!
[2:13:37] <+HakureiIllusion> This is the first point in the game where I got lost
[2:13:48] <Onatamana> Oh god they developed a ground version of the flash kick. Guile will be unstoppable.
[2:13:53] <emMmDeeKay> Robo Woolie?
[2:13:54] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Samus can flashkick from a slide, but cannot move over a 2ft wall
[2:14:02] <Rostichenburg> I only got lost after Screw Attack cause I went exploring
[2:14:03] <+thelovingfool> its the other themal door in the emmi area right?
[2:14:10] <emMmDeeKay> Did woolie turn into Adam?
[2:14:12] <cranestorm922> CatIRyS
[2:14:15] <+D00msDayDan> look guys squeezing through a gap that isn't on the floor is hard
[2:14:18] <CryHavoc_12> Welp, we need the varia suit & the morph ball :P
[2:14:23] <pkthepipes> Honest thoughts so far?
[2:14:40] <+scwry> the game wants layers to follow the pipes
[2:14:52] <DoctorMulholland> If you press Y on a certain map icon, for instance sensor doors, it will highlight ALL icons of that type on the map. Super handy for figuring where to go with a particular powerup.
[2:14:53] <%RyuuAoi> Varia suit always end game.
[2:15:01] <+scwry> @RyuuAoi no?
[2:15:08] <Rostichenburg> It's really not
[2:15:10] <+scwry> varia is always early
[2:15:18] <%RyuuAoi> @scwry Yup

[2:15:48] <Rostichenburg> He can hear you breathing
[2:15:48] <brachydios777> Another fun tidbit: it is speculated that Samus can run up to Mach 1 with the speed boost ability at max run
[2:15:54] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Oh boy
[2:16:04] <%RyuuAoi> I like gravy. But ONLY on Thanksgiving.
[2:16:15] <+DatAsuna> they do the visual ping on anything emmi can hear
[2:16:17] <+OniOniOniiii> yaaaaay you're not further than me, i can stick around

[2:20:13] <%ekodrop> fuck youuuu adam
[2:20:14] <%Prevot> wonder what the federation was thinking making DNA extraction machines samus can't destroy...
[2:20:14] <Rostichenburg> Love your robot Dad/boyfriend

[2:20:35] <solracc25> You can do it
[2:20:39] <redwidow1358> EMBRACE HELPLESSNESS
[2:20:40] <brachydios777> I also read that the Metroid 1 manual and other Nintendo publications lied that Samus was a guy in order to keep the reveal of Samus being a woman at the end of the game
[2:20:40] <%CAPSLOCKlive> "You'll never be Top Tier" -Adam

[2:20:53] <+DatAsuna> and the mangas
[2:20:59] <%RyuuAoi> You've done this a bit
[2:21:09] <+VictorVonLouche> Except EMMI's are super weapons to capture X parasites one of the most deadly things in the universe
[2:21:13] <solracc25> Get that Brain juice
[2:21:17] <%CAPSLOCKlive> The real Dread was the Friends we made along the way?
[2:21:20] <%HollowedIdjit> @Prevot "I am not programmed to lie."
[2:21:23] <+megaman_sentinel> u will always be shit tier
[2:21:30] <Rostichenburg> You need pure robots to fight the X
[2:21:43] <Chichen> their bodies disintegrated woolie you saw it
[2:21:44] <%CAPSLOCKlive> They gotta Voltron by the end
[2:21:45] <+scwry> Theyre going to combine to make a mega-emmi
[2:22:00] <Rostichenburg> Samus absorbed it like the Dragon Souls in Skyrim
[2:22:01] <+StatesmanPrimal> EMMEGA
[2:22:01] <$brave_sj> They disintegrated Woolie
[2:22:13] <%Prevot> they learned their lesson from the cyborg security bot from fusion
[2:22:24] <Onatamana> I don't think I ever defeated any of those things WITHOUT parrying them

[2:22:46] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:22:54] <cranestorm922> Will there be an Omega enemy, that makes the Emmis look like jobbers, tho? nagBrain
[2:23:01] <Rostichenburg> The Feds never learn just like Other M and Fusion
[2:23:20] <%ChoculaUltra> "lets make death robots - for science!" - the feds, probably
[2:23:20] <%Prevot> sometimes I kinda feel like EMMI have that Outlast kinda of AI, built to almost catch you on purpose
[2:23:49] <Rostichenburg> @cranestorm922 Omega Metroid already existed
[2:23:59] <Mundkipz> just joined, why did woolie put his camera there?
[2:24:11] <BlackermanZX> why not
[2:24:16] <%ChoculaUltra> to get kirby in the shot
[2:24:23] <DevinMayCry> Cause text window bottom and stats up top
[2:24:35] <%Afterman_> top mid would be decent i think
[2:24:35] <brachydios777> @mundkipz So not to cover the health bar probably
[2:24:36] <$brave_sj> Somewhere in the top Fed brass there's probably a guy going "Make robots that can beat Samus! She's too unpredictable, we need a contingency!" And then we get shit like this.
[2:24:37] <Darren716> LUL
[2:24:38] <Tempmael> Doesn‚Äôt block ui or text
[2:24:39] <+scwry> damn
[2:24:43] <heartlesshealer> bump
[2:24:47] <+froduck42> it is
[2:24:50] <+Superspider51> it's on the flash
[2:24:50] <+VictorVonLouche> Frame perfect flash
[2:24:50] <Alzero83> that flash is almost instant tho
[2:24:51] <%Afterman_> the cam kinda blocks the omega beam camera angle
[2:24:51] <+thelovingfool> yes
[2:24:51] <Darren716> It's very specific on the flash
[2:24:52] <BlackermanZX> it is
[2:24:52] <%Afterman_> but thats it
[2:24:53] <DevinMayCry> It is but its hard
[2:24:53] <%Namillus> If you see the flash you're too late
[2:24:53] <redwidow1358> It's just before the flash
[2:24:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> right b4
[2:24:54] <Jrocy247> VERY perfect
[2:24:56] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah, same as the other enemies
[2:24:56] <AzureSynesthesia> it is the flash, but the timing varies to make it hard
[2:24:56] <Monkeyweed21> frame perfect
[2:24:58] <+scwry> 8 frames ive heard
[2:24:58] <Rostichenburg> No one thought you could hack robots though
[2:24:58] <+vicepresidentrichardhawk> you have 1 frame
[2:25:00] <Onatamana> Yo check out that frame data
[2:25:01] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Makes sense that this one would be hard to parry
[2:25:01] <+froduck42> it says when you first meet one
[2:25:03] <%HollowedIdjit> it has to be on the flash and it's not consistent when they do it
[2:25:03] <redwidow1358> If you see the flash you already failed, it has to be before
[2:25:04] <+Left_Justified> evo18MindBlown
[2:25:04] <hollumdusk> Accept your helplessness!
[2:25:04] <tompaste1> its super strict
[2:25:06] <cranestorm922> So Woolie can become part of the Hud.
[2:25:08] <solracc25> frame perfect
[2:25:09] <Blank9> The feds are just real proud to make something that can give samus a run for her money
[2:25:09] <+HakureiIllusion> It's on the flash but you barely have any time to react, you have to preempt it slightly
[2:25:09] <Jaller101514> its a red parry
[2:25:11] <%Deft_Thought> Looks like you get two tries though
[2:25:12] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! i believe in the parry
[2:25:15] <+Superspider51> it moves to the exact last spot it hears you at, so if you make a noise, stand still and cloak it will run into you
[2:25:18] <%ChoculaUltra> I'd love to watch Daigo play Dread LUL
[2:25:18] <Asuterisuku> Two separate one-frame windows.
[2:25:19] <DoctorMulholland> It's VERY brief. I think I successfully parried an EMMI 3 times out of the several, SEVERAL times one caught me.
[2:25:25] <BlackermanZX> you get two tries ye
[2:25:27] <solracc25> This game is a nightmare to speedrun
[2:25:32] <Mundkipz> well.. it's in the middle, where there is a lot of activity... is bottom right not an option?
[2:25:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:25:43] <Rostichenburg> The Emmi parry is the final stage of Kirby Quick Draw to put it in terms Woolie can understand
[2:25:44] <+stoicman90> the timing of the 1 frame is also random
[2:25:45] <TehMud> This game is SO GOOOOOD
[2:25:47] <hollumdusk> @solracc25 Well, people already found sequences break, for what I heard
[2:25:51] <DevinMayCry> Its gonna be lit to speedrun. Theres bosses which reward you for sequence breaking
[2:26:04] <cranestorm922> Don't get caught. laynaSmug
[2:26:18] <%Afterman_> @DevinMayCry  apparently theres already a 2 hour speed run
[2:26:28] <CryHavoc_12> Is that purple thing a Power Bomb TakeNRG
[2:26:32] <+scwry> speedruns are going to be so good
[2:26:36] <Rostichenburg> The in game timer does lie a little bit
[2:26:37] <solracc25> @hollumdusk absolutely, but the EMMI are barely consistent.
[2:26:37] <%ChoculaUltra> wouldn't mind if Mercury Steam did a Metroid Fusion remake tbh
[2:26:37] <+stoicman90> 2 hr 17 mins
[2:26:41] <greatspaceadventure> is this the first stream? soz, just got here
[2:26:42] <DevinMayCry> There will be easily a 90 minute sometime I bet
[2:26:45] <+VictorVonLouche> @CryHavoc_12 E tanks
[2:26:50] <+alphonseisbest> @Rostichenburg more then a little
[2:26:57] <Rostichenburg> @ChoculaUltra That was their first idea and they were convinced to do 2 instead
[2:27:07] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I see
[2:27:13] <solracc25> But a 100% speedrun isn't an any% speedrun
[2:27:15] <DevinMayCry> The tease for what people thought was a fusion remake was this though. I dunno if we need a fusion remake anymore
[2:27:18] <CryHavoc_12> @victorvonlouche Oh, still cool.
[2:27:25] <+pupil31> Shoryu flash kick
[2:27:29] <DevinMayCry> Yes
[2:27:30] <%Afterman_> yes
[2:27:33] <Zebroneath> We can hear it
[2:27:34] <%Afterman_> oh the emmi
[2:27:35] <Blank9> it still parries too!
[2:27:36] <Darren716> Oh you mean the EMMI
[2:27:37] <%ChoculaUltra> is Metroid Fusion on the eshop in any form? I'd love to officially own it on the Switcherino
[2:27:37] <%Afterman_> the emmi cannot
[2:27:42] <hollumdusk> @solracc25 I dunno, I am shit at parry, at yet I almost figure out the timing for Purple. I think it's possible to lear them, even if each one is unique
[2:27:44] <Rostichenburg> If the 3DS still existed I could see them doing a lower stakes Fusion remake
[2:27:51] <+DatAsuna> they show sounds emmi can hear visually
[2:28:11] <AstrodropGaming> BAD IDEA
[2:28:18] <+Left_Justified> atpCap
[2:28:18] <+scwry> fusion doesnt need a remake tbh
[2:28:21] <Alzero83> alzeroTestLUL
[2:28:22] <%ChoculaUltra> or a raise-a-parasite-x game ala tamagotchi or digimon would be rad too LUL
[2:28:24] <+scwry> its aged perfectly well
[2:28:38] <%RyuuAoi> The Emmi's come to town around midnight! KappaPride
[2:28:39] <cranestorm922> Royal Guard. SirShield
[2:28:41] <Rostichenburg> There's a lot of talking in Fusion you could cut down
[2:28:56] <%Afterman_> @scwry id say in 5 years give it a remake with SA-X kind of like the emmis, more unscripted chases (alongside the scripted stuff) could be fun
[2:28:57] <+DaRyeBeachHood> you have to parry before the light appears. If you see the light it's too late...
[2:28:59] <%ChoculaUltra> clean!
[2:28:59] <AzureSynesthesia> fusion is only gba and wii u. it was breifly available for early 3ds adopters but isnt anymore
[2:29:01] <hollumdusk> @scwry I dunno, making Sa-X rooms with the EMMI tech would be sick
[2:29:06] <+OniOniOniiii> lol how did that drop look from the emMIs pov
[2:29:21] <@Menitta> I'd go for a Fusion remake with EMMI tech
[2:29:23] <solracc25> @hollumdusk yeah you can learn them, I can do it almost consistent to parry emmi. But that I leave to the frame gods of speedrunners
[2:29:35] <+scwry> LUL
[2:29:35] <%ChoculaUltra> welp
[2:29:37] <%RyuuAoi> @hollumdusk I mean SA-X does that...just slower.
[2:29:38] <+scwry> got it
[2:29:38] <%ChoculaUltra> NICE
[2:29:40] <+scwry> LETS GO
[2:29:41] <roughday25> nice!
[2:29:42] <%RyTYoung> YE
[2:29:43] <+Rekinsinn> Clap
[2:29:45] <AstrodropGaming> crystaPog
[2:29:45] <+Prowtellen> holy shit
[2:29:46] <Alzero83> He did the thing!
[2:29:47] <%ChoculaUltra> oh no!
[2:29:51] <BlackermanZX> nice
[2:29:53] <+Left_Justified> just frame evo18MindBlown
[2:29:56] <roughday25> anywhere but here!
[2:29:59] <%RyTYoung> RUUN
[2:30:02] <CryHavoc_12> SeemsGood
[2:30:02] <Rostichenburg> I didn't get used to the parry on any single Emmi to recognise it as being unique
[2:30:03] <cranestorm922> SaX Emmi. nagFiree
[2:30:04] <+VictorVonLouche> Maps are often useful tools in navigation
[2:30:09] <%Deft_Thought> Schmoovin
[2:30:09] <StarMechV> yeaaah boi
[2:30:16] <hollumdusk> @RyuuAoi Sa-X is a script event. If they would to remake Fusion, I would like them for remade the maps for SA-X to have more "natural" and even random events
[2:30:29] <Buttku> has he fought any of the bosses yet?
[2:30:35] <Darren716> Just the first
[2:30:36] <+OniOniOniiii> i... kinda wish time didnt stop for  you to check he map... thatd be hype
[2:30:39] <%Namillus> He has the Cloak so yes
[2:30:39] <+Prowtellen> probably the invisible lizard boi
[2:30:40] <hollumdusk> @Buttku The first one
[2:30:41] <Asuterisuku> Watching Woolie figure out the movement is amazing.
[2:30:47] <Buttku> cool
[2:30:48] <%RyuuAoi> @hollumdusk You're not wrong, but for the time, an
[2:30:51] <AzureSynesthesia> the way fusion works, it would be better for the sa-x to be scripted imo. just improve it's ai so it doesn't look like a moron lol
[2:30:54] <BlackermanZX> you drained the salsa in one room
[2:31:01] <%RyuuAoi> And on the GBA was HYPE
[2:31:08] <Tempmael> These emmi zones capture the feel of the SA-X from fusion
[2:31:15] <cranestorm922> Turn the SaX into RE2make Mr. X.
[2:31:20] <unrelenting0> Oh no, it looks like you got scared in the exact opposite direction you were supposed to go.
[2:31:21] <Blank9> The best thing about SA-X bar none is the footsteps
[2:31:26] <+scwry> Id rather they make metroid 6 and do something cooler than the SA-X
[2:31:34] <Rostichenburg> The SA X is way more disturbing than these multicolour robot boys
[2:31:39] <DevinMayCry> We need Metroid 6 tommorow not a fusion remake
[2:31:46] <%RyuuAoi> @blank9 They worked with what they had!
[2:31:51] <slix3431> Woolie must travel through... THE SCARY DOOR
[2:32:12] <Inqy833> SA-X is terrifying the first time you encounter it, and trivial the second time you play through the game. Just the way of things. Be interesting if they applied some of the stuff from the better alien/xenomorph games to make a really elaborate predator enemy for Metroid games.
[2:32:20] <Blank9> EMMI work because they‚Äôre melee, dread style SA-X would be super frustrating, or super gimped.
[2:32:20] <Asuterisuku> We REALLY need 6 after that ending.
[2:32:20] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg It concept yes, but just on a first blind playthrough. Once you know it's events, it lost appeal in future playthroughs.
[2:32:23] <kinggum41> does dread run at 60 or are my eyes just stupid
[2:32:25] <Tempmael> Yeah the sound design for the SA-X sold it
[2:32:30] <Rostichenburg> How were these Emmis going to fight the X if all they can do is patrol 1 small zone?
[2:32:43] <+Bearborg> @kinggum41 It does, 30 in cutscenes though
[2:32:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[2:32:44] <Blank9> Dread runs 60, 30 for cutscenes and some visual effects
[2:32:45] <%RyuuAoi> BUY 5 SO WE CAN GET 6
[2:32:48] <hollumdusk> @kinggum41 It does, it barely drops and it rare. Cut Scenes are just 30 tho
[2:32:50] <jett_eyes> why's it sound like DMC3 demon world?
[2:32:58] <UrsaDoom> the SA-X stops being spooky when you replay the game and already know all its scripted encounters.
[2:33:04] <kinggum41> ok thought so, thanks
[2:33:08] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:33:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just shoot up
[2:33:10] <Inqy833> @Rostichenburg Presumably they were just there to capture samples or something, given the thing they do with their head-syringe.
[2:33:12] <slix3431> Feint is devil
[2:33:12] <+scwry> too parry focused LUL
[2:33:13] <+thelovingfool> just shoot em
[2:33:14] <+Beetlewins> you can just shoot them you know
[2:33:17] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:33:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE L BUTTON EXISTS sbfpSetIn woolieSPICE
[2:33:31] <dadeaner> if only there were some sort of projectile weapon
[2:33:34] <Rostichenburg> You can't give Woolie a parry and expect him not to use it
[2:33:35] <+Beetlewins> like one of your entire arms is a gun
[2:33:36] <%RyuuAoi> @ursadoom It's in the GBA. Limitations, Man
[2:33:41] <+VictorVonLouche> SA-X still kicks your ass regardless on sight, which is better than just an instant kill like the emmi's
[2:33:44] <Inqy833> @Rostichenburg Or maybe they were going to be remote operated before they lost contact.
[2:33:48] <+KAz_of_Fighters> I hate those volcano boys
[2:33:48] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:33:55] <kinggum41> these volcano slugs are the devil
[2:33:56] <+Dragoneye77> woolie you shouldn't talk about Pat like that
[2:34:09] <+Dragoneye77> Kappa
[2:34:11] <hollumdusk> @VictorVonLouche I dunno, the Ice Beam was basically an instant kill in those events.
[2:34:31] <cranestorm922> 20% accuracy. koefCool
[2:34:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> You pull those down by grabbing the magnet surface. You've done it before.
[2:34:43] <Blank9> You really only mess with SA-X the once, after the spider boss
[2:34:46] <Rostichenburg> If there was a choice between Samus and a Megaman Zero type other playable character a lot of people would choose the melee
[2:34:54] <Asuterisuku> He'll figure out the magnet walls some day.
[2:34:58] <Blank9> Piece of E
[2:35:02] <AzureSynesthesia> we got pieces of heart now lol
[2:35:04] <+OniOniOniiii> smol e
[2:35:06] <slix3431> E tanks
[2:35:11] <Rostichenburg> They brought those back from Other M
[2:35:17] <Aliensigma> hearts pieces, in my Metroid
[2:35:25] <solracc25> but full e is teasing you
[2:35:28] <CryHavoc_12> Lower case e Tank
[2:35:40] <DaCheekyOne> Is woolie and reggie gonna try type lumina or have they already?
[2:35:44] <kinggum41> metroid fans. you guys satisfied with the new food? cause as a metroid noob id say i am
[2:35:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> 4e=E
[2:35:53] <%Prevot> very
[2:35:56] <Rostichenburg> One fourth of an E an I tank
[2:35:56] <Aliensigma> very
[2:35:58] <BlackermanZX> big E
[2:36:01] <+thelovingfool> @kinggum41 my new favorite in the series
[2:36:02] <AzureSynesthesia> yeah, metroid is my favorite game series and this one is fantastic
[2:36:14] <Inqy833> Love the heavy impact sound effects when Samus hits robots.
[2:36:22] <moonmintparadise> thats what i tought too
[2:36:23] <+scwry> @kinggum41 I may consider this better than super metroid, and thats one of my favourite games ever made
[2:36:25] <Aliensigma> best console metroid since Super
[2:36:27] <hollumdusk> This game  has surpassed my expectations so far, and they were already high enough!
[2:36:29] <CryHavoc_12> An actual E Tank CrreamAwk PowerUpR
[2:36:31] <pi_in_the_sci> use missiles for to search for secrets
[2:36:36] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus Imagine Daft Punk doing Metroid soundtrack. End Of Line.
[2:36:38] <+OniOniOniiii> whyy is there a noise in the room tho
[2:36:42] <+OniOniOniiii> super scary
[2:36:50] <Asuterisuku> This game has a very real chance to be my favourite video game. Period.
[2:36:51] <hollumdusk> That mid game twist has been intense so far for me
[2:36:57] <+scwry> @Asuterisuku same
[2:37:09] <kinggum41> guess metroid is finally back then. No let's pray they can figure out them F-zero controls
[2:37:13] <slix3431> Woolie needs redemption with them bats
[2:37:16] <Inqy833> They're learning
[2:37:18] <+scwry> give a man a parry and he will forget all his other tools
[2:37:19] <ExpressNode> Just got back from work.  It was an ass of a day because some assholes created more work for me
[2:37:19] <+thelovingfool> i dont like super as much as most people
[2:37:30] <Rostichenburg> It's certainly up there as far as Metroid games go I'm just not a huge fan of stalker gameplay like this and RE3
[2:37:37] <%Prevot> to think we could have been getting games like this on a regular basis, instead of once every 15 years...
[2:37:39] <AzureSynesthesia> I'm a diehard fusion fan, so i really loved all the fusion stuff in this
[2:37:48] <%kyh9> Animation work is immaculate
[2:37:51] <Asuterisuku> We'll see how it holds up down the line when the hype has worn off.
[2:37:52] <%Deft_Thought> Stop being so cool, Samus
[2:37:53] <+Beetlewins> Samus this weapon on your arm is both a high powered blaster and a missile launcher, so punch everything
[2:37:53] <Aliensigma> Super Takes getting used to, especially with so many metroid likes that have better controls
[2:37:53] <BlackermanZX> its so damn well animated
[2:38:00] <AngryAsian5> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:38:01] <greatspaceadventure> @AzureSynesthesia HARD same, and i didn't even like Fusion at first
[2:38:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Very hot nikkib12Lewd
[2:38:02] <%Afterman_> anyone who isnt a fusion fan cannot be trusted
[2:38:03] <hollumdusk> I prefer the GBA games over Super, yet I "get" Super is the better game, and I still love it, even if it's not my fave.
[2:38:05] <prime_name> I hope they keep the white suit going forward for Samus.
[2:38:05] <+OniOniOniiii> i did th for like 10 minutes at the start of thae game lol
[2:38:18] <@Menitta> Samus's body language in this is so badass
[2:38:18] <solracc25> hmm
[2:38:20] <+scwry> speed blocks monkaS
[2:38:21] <BlackermanZX> >
[2:38:24] <$BioStormX> @hollumdusk Fusion is my favorite, though super metroid is my second favorite
[2:38:29] <%RyuuAoi> @expressnode Don't let them leave until they complete their job! Don't make it hard on your shift because they can't do what they are paid for.
[2:38:36] <CryHavoc_12> Power Bomb?
[2:38:40] <Darren716> Just assume every secret you cant get yet
[2:38:48] <solracc25> This puzzle was very tasking to do
[2:38:58] <Darren716> And yeah this one was a pain
[2:38:59] <+thelovingfool> this game LOVES speed puzzles
[2:39:07] <Alzero83> I honestly dont know how to solve that one
[2:39:07] <+scwry> the speed puzzles are very satisfying
[2:39:09] <prime_name> Loves them a bit too much
[2:39:10] <Alzero83> I tried
[2:39:15] <%RyuuAoi> @biostormx Playing through Super currently and it get me sooo mad!
[2:39:16] <Rostichenburg> Gonna need timestop to get past that block
[2:39:16] <Blank9> Those item percentages will taunt you even 6 hours in
[2:39:18] <BlackermanZX> speed block puzzles are so good
[2:39:25] <+scwry> 3rd area, still no morph ball
[2:39:30] <+CalderGaming> pargon
[2:39:31] <%Prevot> so, can't you see the sky from here? how's this underground?
[2:39:31] <%ChoculaUltra> top 5 zones of all time LUL
[2:39:32] <Tempmael> LUL
[2:39:34] <AzureSynesthesia> its kinda annoying how you have to manually activate speedbooster before the running start, for no reason
[2:39:35] <ExpressNode> @RyuuAoi Thanks for that

[2:39:40] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd
[2:39:41] <Rostichenburg> Some of the Shine Spark puzzles in this are psychotic
[2:39:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:46] <+thelovingfool> cause they're a fuck

[2:39:51] <Tempmael> can we talk about how clean the new suit looks?
[2:39:52] <Darren716> The one with the ramps is fucked up
[2:39:53] <$brave_sj> What'd Ron do to deserve that?
[2:39:54] <kinggum41> god this game looks good

[2:40:00] <%Prevot> LUL
[2:40:01] <greatspaceadventure> i can see a Warriors type thing
[2:40:02] <BlackermanZX> that would be evil
[2:40:03] <+scwry> maybe this one is Kappa
[2:40:04] <%RyTYoung> That would be a sin
[2:40:05] <%RyuuAoi> @expressnode I am serious! I've been there! üíØ
[2:40:05] <GarettLefebvre> What is Woolies success rate for parrying EMMI's so far?
[2:40:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> Like the latter half of ZM?
[2:40:10] <UrsaDoom> but the pee is stored in the morph ball
[2:40:11] <+StatesmanPrimal> LUL sad crawl
[2:40:12] <%Sparkseid> blasphemy
[2:40:13] <brachydios777> Heresy
[2:40:13] <Darren716> 2 for 5 I think?
[2:40:14] <Onatamana> you learn horizontal corkscrew jump
[2:40:17] <hueley> Riot, Chaos in the streets
[2:40:17] <Zebroneath> Morph ball TOO iconic, but that be wild
[2:40:18] <Blank9> Nothing‚Äôs more nuts than fusion‚Äôs hidden conversation nav room shinespark puzzle
[2:40:21] <+cleese> samus hurt her back and cannot morph ball
[2:40:29] <@Menitta> Metroid learns to crawl
[2:40:33] <prime_name> Zero Suit crawl
[2:40:35] <Rostichenburg> Samus doing Cannon Spikes to get through holes instead
[2:40:35] <%townzzzzz> how about a metroid in were you can't jump
[2:40:36] <+CalderGaming> look up CanadianAniGuy's cartoon about this on twitter
[2:40:41] <+stoicman90> my first run took 13 hrs to get 100%
[2:40:42] <+scwry> spazer before morph ball is insane to think about
[2:40:52] <Blank9> I want slide to stay in for future Metroids so bad, it needs to be a staple like ledge grabbing
[2:40:52] <hollumdusk> The Theme on this stage makes me think of movies like Predator and Aliens for... "some reason"
[2:40:53] <+OniOniOniiii> you get a smol Cute furry friend to explore the vents :) it'll be samus's friend in the movie
[2:40:56] <+thelovingfool> sped, i am sped
[2:41:03] <kinggum41> ok let's see if he gets stuck here like I did
[2:41:08] <+Beetlewins> I got stuck here too
[2:41:14] <hollumdusk> @OniOniOniiii You mean her pet Rabbit in the manga?
[2:41:24] <+OniOniOniiii> oh no
[2:41:32] <+OniOniOniiii> i didnt know PepeLa
[2:41:39] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie, are you gonna steal a pumpkin pie for Canadian Thanksgiving? I could go for a pumpkin pie rn tbh.
[2:41:43] <Bananassassin> oof
[2:41:44] <%BinaryFireball> is this a new metroid game?
[2:41:44] <moonmintparadise> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:41:45] <+thelovingfool> right idea
[2:41:46] <roughday25> aaa
[2:41:51] <ElPlasa> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:41:55] <$brave_sj> The other one tho
[2:41:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> At least he's trying
[2:42:01] <kinggum41> he's as dumb as me thank god
[2:42:03] <slix3431> @RyuuAoi Pump pie is the only pie worth stealing
[2:42:07] <solracc25> cold
[2:42:07] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will figure it out woolieFABRICATION
[2:42:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> This room is kind of bs
[2:42:10] <%CAPSLOCKlive> i heard people crapping on the game's performance, but this seems totally fine to me so far
[2:42:10] <moonmintparadise> i legit got stuck here too and went back TWICE
[2:42:11] <%tank7013> @BinaryFireball Yea. Came out like 2 days ago
[2:42:13] <+scwry> i guess im just conditioned to notice suspicious floors
[2:42:17] <solracc25> warmer
[2:42:20] <%RyuuAoi> @slix3431 EXTRA whipped topping
[2:42:27] <+thelovingfool> ding ding ding
[2:42:27] <moonmintparadise> PHEW
[2:42:31] <roughday25> @scwry same
[2:42:32] <BlackermanZX> when in doubt missile everything
[2:42:33] <kinggum41> nevermind he's smarter than me
[2:42:33] <AzureSynesthesia> eyyyy
[2:42:35] <Rostichenburg> This is why you should always get bombs early so you can test every surface
[2:42:38] <roughday25> aaaayyy
[2:42:45] <Blank9> The map is so helpful in this
[2:42:45] <kinggum41> i got that on accident

[2:43:00] <Tempmael> celan
[2:43:00] <%Prevot> PogChamp
[2:43:01] <AzureSynesthesia> they made missiles work like bombs to let you test the surfaces though
[2:43:02] <+thelovingfool> getting those fuckers feels so good
[2:43:04] <Asuterisuku> Be wary when there's a one tile gap between visible rooms
[2:43:08] <solracc25> perfect
[2:43:10] <%RyTYoung> yeyeyeye
[2:43:10] <CryHavoc_12> woolieGASM
[2:43:13] <Bananassassin> Parry mechanics feel fantastic, in other news: Sky indeed blue.
[2:43:15] <+Rolandknight> you don't even get bombs till halfway through the game
[2:43:17] <Rostichenburg> Missiles are a limited resource
[2:43:26] <AzureSynesthesia> you get lots of missiles by parrying
[2:43:33] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie STRONG
[2:43:34] <Rostichenburg> Can't parry a wall
[2:43:37] <%tank7013> @CAPSLOCKlive It mostly runs pretty well but performance issues might be a bit inconsistent? I had drop in places where I saw them run smooth for other people
[2:43:38] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg Unless you embrace the parry
[2:43:42] <solracc25> missiles are almost free
[2:43:50] <+thelovingfool> 2 missles kill them
[2:43:50] <Blank9> Yeah, one parry kill you‚Äôll have most missiles back
[2:43:54] <Rostichenburg> They're not free to the brain though
[2:44:01] <AzureSynesthesia> thats on you then lol
[2:44:09] <Blank9> They‚Äôre so plentiful I wish missiles were toggle r, not hold r
[2:44:18] <+OniOniOniiii> stuffed
[2:44:20] <solracc25> They're free to hit the brain tho
[2:44:21] <+thelovingfool> i have never ran out of missles in this game
[2:44:35] <%RyTYoung> That's one thing I wish, was an option to change the controls NotLikeThis
[2:44:35] <roughday25> ...wait can you parry those projectiles to block them?
[2:44:39] <+scwry> boss fights i go crazy with missiles
[2:44:43] <hollumdusk> Only in boss fights for me, specially with the later upgrades
[2:44:47] <ExpressNode> Since he's streaming today I assume there will be no podcast because of the holiday?
[2:44:52] <%RyuuAoi> The fact they you can just run across the floor and they open up and you don't have to shoot them is a God send.
[2:44:57] <Carlioo> wait the laser turrets have a parry window
[2:45:02] <hollumdusk> yes
[2:45:02] <Rostichenburg> The running counter is an attack so it might destroy the spikes?
[2:45:09] <Carlioo> sick
[2:45:15] <Davybot> this game would be kino if it had remappable controls
[2:45:22] <UrsaDoom> Sonic
[2:45:22] <+scwry> monkaS
[2:45:38] <Carlioo> the switch has remappable controls! but I think it'd be confusing unless you learned all the controls by memory
[2:45:39] <%RyuuAoi> @expressnode FUCK THANKSGIVING. FUCK THE PILGRIMS.
[2:45:42] <Rostichenburg> Nintendo doesn't like remapping controls or giving the player camera controls they think they know better
[2:45:43] <%RyTYoung> very kino indeed
[2:45:47] <%RyTYoung> gigaboOtsBani
[2:45:48] <DevinMayCry> @Davybot Switch has universal remappable
[2:45:53] <solracc25> danger zone
[2:45:57] <$brave_sj> Spooky
[2:45:57] <ElPlasa> it needs MORE POWER
[2:45:59] <roughday25> I wish they did more dark zones like this
[2:46:00] <+thelovingfool> SO GOOD
[2:46:00] <AzureSynesthesia> i just wish you could set speed booster to activate automatically like the other games
[2:46:01] <+OniOniOniiii> i like how there are so many pathways in the background and Samus is complete uninterested in them LOL
[2:46:01] <DoctorMulholland> Love the look of the dark areas
[2:46:05] <Asuterisuku> No power? Curious.
[2:46:13] <%RyTYoung> good shit right there
[2:46:15] <solracc25> spooky

[2:46:22] <DevinMayCry> In switch setting you can remap every button and save presets to load as needed
[2:46:24] <+scwry> this is very fusion
[2:46:26] <DoctorMulholland> That is some Splinter Cell aesthetic right there.
[2:46:30] <Inqy833> Nightmare flashbacks from Fusion
[2:46:34] <Rostichenburg> Needed a Donkey Kong Country Returns silhouette area
[2:46:35] <solracc25> glow
[2:46:38] <%RyuuAoi> Dark Samus?
[2:46:38] <Tempmael> bringing the sense of dread

[2:46:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:46:47] <+thelovingfool> woolie
[2:46:52] <ElPlasa> the neon green highlights on the suit? Chefs kiss
[2:46:53] <+OniOniOniiii> music is so good too
[2:47:14] <prime_name> I love how much horror Fusion introduced into the franchise
[2:47:21] <Rostichenburg> Send the art in the phallic direction of the Alien series
[2:47:28] <bippityjones> Breakable Blocks can't be deactivated though
[2:47:38] <Tempmael> that jump sound is so iconic
[2:47:50] <CryHavoc_12> Reminds me of Crashed Ship in Super Metroid.
[2:47:53] <hollumdusk> @prime_name Fusion was Sakamoto looking at Super's title screen, and saying "what if we made a game out of this feeling?"
[2:48:20] <%RyTYoung> I was surprised to have been given a switch oled for my birthday which has been awesome! sadly none of my save data backed up from my old console, so I have to wait until I get my old switch fixed NotLikeThis
[2:48:20] <roughday25> ayyy
[2:48:29] <+scwry> unlock the metroid brain
[2:48:29] <bippityjones> 2020Celebrate
[2:48:32] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus is the suit growing in ya?
[2:48:42] <+alphonseisbest> @prime_name and then Other M was him saying what is we made a game outta the feeling of DA BABY
[2:48:52] <DaCheekyOne> Are there bosses in this game?
[2:48:54] <solracc25> more power
[2:48:55] <+CalderGaming> SO MUCH MONEY
[2:48:56] <+scwry> this suit fucks hard
[2:48:57] <%CAPSLOCKlive> if nothing else, Metroid knows how to feel more intense than most "creepy souls-borne-metroid-vania platformers"
[2:49:02] <CryHavoc_12> Power go onnnnn
[2:49:03] <%Prevot> Kreygasm
[2:49:04] <+DatAsuna> fo sho

[2:49:52] <%RyuuAoi> @beetlewins That Nike SB collab tho!
[2:49:53] <+alphonseisbest> @Beetlewins JPN doesn't like Metroid that much, just look at how well Other M sold
[2:49:55] <ElPlasa> @CAPSLOCKlive Mainly because it takes inspiration from an actuall horror franchise, instead of a franchise with some horror elements

[2:51:12] <DaCheekyOne> @Wafflesisdog Don't forget about their sidekick Vania
[2:51:26] <AzureSynesthesia> those types of blocks are kinda annoying cause they will often block paths in a way that never gets undone lol

[2:52:18] <%RyuuAoi> I'd definitely wear some Samus/Metroid Nike exclusives! Maybe we have a better chance with the Nintendo Universal Studios collab!
[2:52:32] <%Namillus> Konami said the response to the rerelease on Switch would judge whether they do more Castlevania but I'll believe it when I see it
[2:53:01] <%RyuuAoi> @namillus FUCK KONAMI
[2:53:05] <solracc25> must complete map with new tool
[2:53:07] <%Namillus> Yeah
[2:53:19] <Rostichenburg> Would love a Metroid part of Nintendo Land at Universal Studios if we can just get Metroid to sell 500 million more copies
[2:53:25] <+Beetlewins> Konami hoped all their money would be coming from their f2p football game but then they rushed it out and everyone hates it
[2:53:26] <bottomglasscinema> This game is like the Dark Souls of video games.

[2:54:57] <+scwry> shinespark is the best
[2:54:58] <AzureSynesthesia> speed booster is what makes metroid, metroid
[2:55:04] <UrsaDoom> Frankly, if you can build a robot that can get the better of Samus, whatever else you're hiding seems like an unnecessary project.
[2:55:06] <Chichen> I really dislike shinespark puzzles in this game
[2:55:07] <hollumdusk> Dead

[2:56:18] <%RyTYoung> VoteNay
[2:56:23] <+rbakervv> you going tothe wrong way wooie
[2:56:30] <+rbakervv> you are wasting your time
[2:56:31] <roughday25> maybe try and lure it out of that room, into the big one?
[2:56:34] <DaCheekyOne> Almost as fast as Pat reaching for the load button after a missed item
[2:56:51] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:56:55] <+scwry> not sure what youre trying to accomplish
[2:57:01] <+pupil31> nope
[2:57:01] <+thelovingfool> no
[2:57:02] <%HollowedIdjit> you cannot
[2:57:02] <+rbakervv> you can't do that
[2:57:03] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:57:06] <$brave_sj> no lol
[2:57:06] <+Beetlewins> Woolie you can't go that way
[2:57:08] <+OniOniOniiii> nah lolol
[2:57:08] <+VictorVonLouche> Why is woolie going the clearly wrong way?
[2:57:09] <GarettLefebvre> I'm surprised to see Woolie throwing out the parry early
[2:57:10] <Blank9> bopping your head
[2:57:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> NEW ITEM
[2:57:11] <Mvrdok_> Not yet
[2:57:12] <%brisk_dacat> Maybe if you slide??
[2:57:12] <solracc25> you can't
[2:57:12] <AstrodropGaming> Looks too tight
[2:57:14] <%RyuuAoi> Cloak?
[2:57:14] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Needs speed
[2:57:16] <+rbakervv> that's the wrong wayh
[2:57:17] <+thelovingfool> @DaCheekyOne oh no how maytimes did he do that
[2:57:20] <+OniOniOniiii> you need time stop i think
[2:57:26] <solracc25> game design means no
[2:57:34] <pi_in_the_sci> I think it just wants you to go back to the last map with your wide beam
[2:57:40] <NotHereToStream> wait for a speedrunner to sequence break and pass that shit
[2:57:43] <+rbakervv> you can't do it now
[2:57:48] <+rbakervv> you are done here
[2:57:56] <%CAPSLOCKlive> just do everything perfect and make no mistakes on your first time
[2:58:06] <+thelovingfool> use wide beam in other map?
[2:58:09] <Rostichenburg> Enemy spawner
[2:58:09] <+megaman_sentinel> small area
[2:58:12] <+rbakervv> no, you are done here
[2:58:15] <+OniOniOniiii> hi
[2:58:20] <+OniOniOniiii> hi samus
[2:58:23] <+scwry> this is a dead end area
[2:58:25] <+Buzzard42> rekt
[2:58:32] <+VictorVonLouche> why is woolie commiting sucide?
[2:58:36] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie STUCK
[2:58:37] <CommanderCOOL> you have two change to counter the emii
[2:58:37] <+Buzzard42> let woolie experiment
[2:58:41] <CommanderCOOL> *chances
[2:58:47] <+rbakervv> you are done here
[2:58:49] <%RyuuAoi> EASY GAME, RIGHT COWARDS?
[2:58:50] <+rbakervv> move on
[2:59:04] <DaCheekyOne> Woolie is just demonstrating the dangers of repeating their mistakes. Thank you for the educational material
[2:59:08] <+The_Devil_Breaker> This music reminds me of the Tron world in Kingdom Hearts 2
[2:59:11] <+rbakervv> there is nothing on this map for you
[2:59:12] <+VictorVonLouche> seems to be a DOOR above your head.
[2:59:22] <+scwry> to save some stress, you can explore more freely once you kill an emmi in the area
[2:59:25] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie (WILL) Figure It Out
[2:59:25] <Asuterisuku> This is NOT an easy game but that certainly lends to the atmosphere.
[2:59:27] <+Beetlewins> You have a train to catch
[2:59:31] <solracc25> people shh. that's part of the game
[2:59:32] <Monkeyweed21> @VictorVonLouche door is blocked
[2:59:38] <+Rekinsinn> the area's flashing because there's a hidden item, doesn't mean it's progress
[2:59:50] <+DatAsuna> Man, remember the Prime 2 trailer with dark luminoth?
[3:00:07] <vstpnv> he'll figure it out. he has a whole ass podcast about it. shush
[3:00:07] <Rostichenburg> No that was like 20 years ago
[3:00:25] <GarettLefebvre> Good practice on that parry timing
[3:00:27] <+DatAsuna> Don't make it set in
[3:00:45] <bippityjones> I feel like they nailed the breadcrumbing in this game to the point where it feels linear, like if you hit a dead end right as you unlock something they leave a trail of stuff you can newly activate on the way to the new thing
[3:00:49] <CryHavoc_12> Man, hope some dumb Phazon bs happens PowerUpL woolieGASM PowerUpR
[3:00:49] <%RyuuAoi> PEE YOUR PANTS AND KEEP PLAYONG
[3:00:49] <+CalderGaming> hi baz plushie
[3:00:54] <Inqy833> Does Samus ever have to go to the bathroom or does her suit take care of it?
[3:00:55] <%RyuuAoi> NOOOOOOO. DREAD
[3:01:00] <majindusto> THE DREAD

[3:01:24] <kinggum41> is there a fucking diaper streamer
[3:01:26] <+DatAsuna> just reuse those milk bags
[3:01:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> @inqy833 Her suit jacks her off
[3:01:33] <+Buzzard42> coward woolie can't handle pissbottle tech
[3:01:40] <+Rekinsinn> does woolie know about how you can hit Y on the map to highlight every one of some type of map element i.e. every triple shot door?
[3:01:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> happy diapersgiving chat

[3:02:26] <%RyuuAoi> WELCOME back to the Woolie woolieVS Sunday Service!
[3:02:30] <+ScatFace> samus holds her piss in during the mission, if it's post Metroid/x DNA, her Metroid DNA absorbs the piss obviously
[3:02:30] <hollumdusk> Welp, in other news, Experiment No. Z-57 is kicking my ass.
[3:02:50] <%RyuuAoi> Praise and worship time! Bring in the Praise Dancers !
[3:02:52] <vstpnv> barbHYPERPLS
[3:03:05] <kinggum41> what gaming character goes the longest without a bathroom break
[3:03:12] <drunken_lemur> Gon in 60 seconds 12 is up
[3:03:15] <DaCheekyOne> Now I feel relieved!
[3:03:20] <+DatAsuna> @ScatFace nah the suit recycles the piss into drinking water just like master chief
[3:03:21] <+Rekinsinn> yeyeyeyeye
[3:03:24] <CryHavoc_12> @kinggum41 Snake
[3:03:27] <+DatAsuna> it doesn't jack her off tho
[3:03:28] <hollumdusk> @kinggum41 I just know Travis has the worst record at that
[3:03:51] <UrsaDoom> Samus pee is stored in the morph ball.
[3:04:08] <+OniOniOniiii> the piss is recycled into boost for shine sparking
[3:04:09] <kinggum41> wait. Does strive jacko need to piss? does original jacko? how do these weird synthetics work
[3:04:13] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Contrary to popular internet belief people who play games sometimes need to play the game to learn the game
[3:04:20] <+OniOniOniiii> boost while you piss
[3:04:43] <Rostichenburg> That's a hell of a music transition
[3:04:53] <CryHavoc_12> Ayy we Traversing in here woolieGASM
[3:04:55] <ohno778> I wanna play Kingdom Hearts now

[3:05:09] <DaCheekyOne> Liquid soap or hard soap to wash hands?
[3:05:11] <%RyTYoung> Traversing Metroid Dread with Traverse Town is kinda weird but okay LUL
[3:05:14] <DontChuckle98> Just finished Dread. Dude, the final battle with Waluigi is INSANE!
[3:05:37] <+ScatFace> one winged waluigi's great
[3:05:37] <+CalderGaming> wwwwaaaaaaaah
[3:05:42] <+IHATREID> this sounds like every song in xenoblade chronicles
[3:05:42] <hollumdusk> To think we live in a timeline where KH music and Metroid together, actually make sense!
[3:05:48] <kinggum41> @DaCheekyOne liquid takes priority
[3:06:03] <Rostichenburg> Samus basically wears Keyblade Armour
[3:06:20] <%RyuuAoi> I hope you all have been taking your communion throughout this sermon as I have. There will be an Alter Call following today Sunday Stream for all the lost souls. amen!
[3:06:30] <Wafflesisdog> what is happening when samus goes morphball mode
[3:06:39] <%jinking79> Ed u got one month left to live before Luke comes out

[3:08:46] <+Beetlewins> Samus liqufies and turns into goop that sloshes around the morph ball
[3:08:51] <+IHATREID> since dread seemed way more marketed towards the west should we be getting even more if this game does well
[3:09:05] <%isa_sensei96> isa_sensei96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hey, no idea whether you're in the head space to attend cons again, but the deadline to pre-register for MagFest and be eligible for the hotel room lottery is this Tuesday by 11:59 PM in case you were interested.
[3:09:15] <+IHATREID> excluding the likelihood of a prime 4 and remastered trilogy
[3:09:26] <Rostichenburg> The only aggressively Japanese Metroid is Other M
[3:09:35] <Wafflesisdog> metroid kart racing
[3:09:49] <+AttleboroTaco> Never played Metroid, but woolie streaming on a sunday is awesome. I have an infected tooth and a swollen face so its nice to try and get some distraction watching one of my favorite internet personalities
[3:10:18] <NotHereToStream> dammit woolie

[3:10:26] <+OniOniOniiii> suuuuure, its waaaater
[3:10:27] <Jrocy247> GG Woollie
[3:10:29] <NotHereToStream> well be glad it was water
[3:10:29] <BlackermanZX> f
[3:10:30] <%RyuuAoi> I feel we may get another 3D Metroid in this generation honestly.
[3:10:32] <CryHavoc_12> Such Hydration
[3:10:32] <AstrodropGaming> Good job
[3:10:37] <%RyTYoung> did it get on anything?
[3:10:42] <KnivesEve> oh no what happened??
[3:10:43] <ExpressNode> That's sucks but at least it ain't juice
[3:10:50] <nastybagl> <3
[3:10:51] <%jinking79> so the diaper was a good idea
[3:10:52] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie fucked the stream up?
[3:10:54] <Darren716> The return of underwear mics
[3:10:55] <prime_name> atleast it's wates
[3:10:55] <%RyuuAoi> CLASSIC
[3:10:56] <+MisterAvry> I just tuned in, what did you dooooooo?!
[3:11:00] <Rostichenburg> Probably just get Prime 4 and another one of these 2d ones
[3:11:01] <NotHereToStream> this was the real dread all along
[3:11:03] <%CAPSLOCKlive> And that's why we need DIaper tech
[3:11:04] <TehMud> Shit someone call Plague
[3:11:05] <Blank9> Everyone‚Äôs cursed to spill something streaming dread
[3:11:16] <%BisoromiBear> always be diaped
[3:11:17] <+DatAsuna> nothing exploded... yet so all good then
[3:11:18] <+alphonseisbest> its ok
[3:11:19] <Jrocy247> Woolie pissed himself on stream, before Pat...Let it be known Kappa
[3:11:28] <AstrodropGaming> Diaper up son!
[3:11:29] <+megaman_sentinel> lol
[3:11:31] <+alphonseisbest> it happends to the best of us Kappa
[3:11:32] <%Sparkseid> is it fine?
[3:11:38] <+OniOniOniiii> Commit to diaper Sundays, Accept you helplessness
[3:11:38] <nastybagl> well and u
[3:11:39] <locbont> skill issue
[3:11:42] <%komradedog> im dry
[3:11:45] <+MisterAvry> I'm having a great Sunday, thank you
[3:11:45] <Tempmael> how are you liking the game?
[3:11:46] <roughday25> make sure you wear a gravity diaper so your movement isn't slowed while wet
[3:11:48] <%jinking79> well better than Pat shitting chocolate on his ass
[3:11:49] <+alphonseisbest> @Jrocy247 but Pat did shit himself before Wools LUL
[3:11:52] <ExpressNode> Tired and weary from work
[3:11:54] <%RyuuAoi> We will accept it and live with it, Woolie, because this is what you have promised us from day one!
[3:11:58] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Just cover the whole couch in plastic
[3:12:01] <%RyTYoung> I'm good I'm playing some Dread atm woolieYE
[3:12:04] <+ScatFace> is this the first stream for dread?
[3:12:09] <Jrocy247> @alphonseisbest Damn it, you know what. THAT'S TRUE
[3:12:20] <churropoppa> Woolie peed himself before Baby Dick Pat LUL
[3:12:22] <+alphonseisbest> yea it is LUL
[3:12:26] <nastybagl> are you enjoying metroid dread
[3:12:26] <theanora1> Gotta stream for the toilet, like a pro
[3:12:53] <Rostichenburg> I feel like I'm betraying Metroid by playing it on a TV instead of hand held
[3:12:59] <Wafflesisdog> i legit might buy a switch finally for this game (and all the other classics as well i guess )
[3:13:06] <@Solidus_113> Switch has IR pointer
[3:13:09] <%RyuuAoi> @theanora1 WOOLIE WUD
[3:13:12] <OfficerMods> what do you mean no wiimote
[3:13:13] <Darren716> Like 1 and 2 were?
[3:13:14] <NotHereToStream> don't let mp4 be the new bayo3
[3:13:17] <Qsmash_> embrace gyro aiming
[3:13:17] <Blank9> could joycon gyro
[3:13:18] <%Prevot> it better have gyro controls
[3:13:19] <theanora1> the joycons can work like the Wii-mote
[3:13:23] <+IHATREID> but skyward sword hd does the joycon wiimote thing
[3:13:23] <%jinking79> like the gamecube
[3:13:27] <doggieo> Switch Motion controls are pretty good
[3:13:28] <kikoeru_san> yes Halo
[3:13:29] <%RyuuAoi> We have joy cons, Woolie! But they are shit!
[3:13:32] <nastybagl> to be fair the switch gyro is far superior to the wii's
[3:13:34] <+DatAsuna> leave that in splatoon
[3:13:35] <@Solidus_113> splatoon uses it great
[3:13:38] <Jrocy247> There's no way they would do that
[3:13:39] <AzureSynesthesia> you are good, no gyros
[3:13:39] <kikoeru_san> I want Halo
[3:13:40] <%Prevot> I wanna play it like I played Galaxy on switch
[3:13:41] <Qsmash_> gyro aiming is great
[3:13:42] <@Menitta> It worked great with Prime Trilogy
[3:13:44] <+megaman_sentinel> GameCube best cube
[3:13:45] <toulon_somberjade> Or just back to the GameCube control scheme
[3:13:50] <+DatAsuna> Star fox will never be allowed to not push gimmicks
[3:13:52] <GeltonZ> @nastybagl Gyro is superior but no pointer.
[3:13:55] <Darren716> I imagine it'll be optional, like I don't think many switch games required gyro
[3:13:57] <+ScatFace> isn't the IR blaster on the back of the joycon?
[3:14:02] <+VictorVonLouche> They ruined all ports with that stupid motion control feature
[3:14:03] <Rostichenburg> Might have both considering Skyward Sword does
[3:14:05] <nastybagl> i honestly wish more games used the motion joycons because it's really accurate and advanced
[3:14:07] <+ScatFace> I don't see how it would work
[3:14:14] <%RyuuAoi> @megaman_sentinel MY MAN
[3:14:23] <+CalderGaming> boooooo
[3:14:26] <+DatAsuna> boo
[3:14:33] <Jrocy247> I am absolutely fine with regular controller support. Do not force Gyros
[3:14:42] <GeltonZ> @nastybagl REALLY?! What games did you play?! The gyro always gets really de-calibrated for me.
[3:14:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can't stop the Pungeon Master
[3:15:00] <Darren716> Kappa
[3:15:32] <+DatAsuna> that's a good one too
[3:15:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:15:35] <+IHATREID> with those dolls in the back i thought woolie had a damn claw machine
[3:15:40] <AzureSynesthesia> zero mission is the gold standard of video game remakes
[3:15:49] <thunderborn32> the real question is: IS dread a massive skam to give Samus a counter in smash
[3:15:56] <@Menitta> pffff
[3:16:03] <ElPlasa> coom blaster
[3:16:06] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:16:12] <+Beetlewins> spooge cannon
[3:16:17] <%KetsuoTaberu> lmao
[3:16:23] <+ScatFace> smash gave samus melee attacks
[3:16:28] <CryHavoc_12> The Coom
[3:16:33] <+ScatFace> it's not the other way around
[3:16:46] <thunderborn32> smash didn't give her a counter
[3:16:50] <AzureSynesthesia> samus returns had a counter and that released before ultimate iirc
[3:16:59] <thunderborn32> :O did it?
[3:17:21] <+ScatFace> yes, returns had the parry but it wasn't as satisfying as it is here
[3:17:26] <+ScatFace> it was rather slow
[3:17:31] <+Beetlewins> Yeah, Samus Returns was basically a prototype for this game
[3:17:53] <GeltonZ> XD WHAT?! Brazillian scumbag kite tech?!
[3:17:54] <+DatAsuna> not everything has to be a bloddsport?????

[3:17:57] <BlackermanZX> extreme kite pvp
[3:17:57] <+ScatFace> dread is better than returns in every way imo
[3:17:58] <+DatAsuna> say it ain't so
[3:17:59] <+Beetlewins> Just dont tie swords to your kite
[3:18:03] <nintega010> kkte decapatation
[3:18:05] <+MisterAvry> sometimes making a colorful thing dance is enough
[3:18:13] <oneimportantthing> Dread is absolutely a masterpiece. You
[3:18:26] <oneimportantthing> You're gonna love it
[3:18:32] <Rostichenburg> Why you gotta make Kites fight
[3:18:34] <jett_eyes> dunno man, Kite gangs could be real
[3:18:34] <SlimCognitoEntertainment> Kite tier list when
[3:18:37] <kinggum41> oh yeah, gave blood for the first time today. Encourage anyone who's interested to give it a go. Especially minority communities
[3:18:39] <+ScatFace> too early to call it a masterpiece but I loved the game
[3:18:45] <TigerClaws12> gyro aiming is supposed to aid stick aiming, not an exclusive thing @WoolieVersus (think last second fine adjustment before firing)
[3:18:53] <+ScatFace> enjoy dread woolie
[3:18:55] <%illicitdonut> We kite meming?
[3:18:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Have you ever read The Kite Runner Woolz?
[3:19:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Back into the dread
[3:19:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> despite the name it does not have much to do with kites
[3:19:15] <%ennui_on_me> has woolie fought the second boss yet?
[3:19:17] <SlimCognitoEntertainment> Is he liking it so far?
[3:19:19] <+DatAsuna> no

[3:19:31] <+IHATREID> woolie fucking hates metroid guys
[3:19:32] <+DatAsuna> to ennui that is

[3:20:05] <pi_in_the_sci> it won't show beam door covers
[3:20:07] <SlimCognitoEntertainment> @DatAsuna slimco1Obj sweet
[3:20:07] <Darren716> No sound?
[3:20:08] <%CAPSLOCKlive> that's a good button
[3:20:13] <+CalderGaming> no game sound
[3:20:16] <+thelovingfool> @WoolieVersus no sound
[3:20:25] <+CalderGaming> there we go
[3:20:51] <+ScatFace> Emmi rape
[3:20:54] <@Menitta> NICE
[3:20:57] <roughday25> nice!
[3:20:59] <AzureSynesthesia> good stuff
[3:21:04] <%CAPSLOCKlive> ROYAL GUARD
[3:21:04] <AngryAsian5> NOICE
[3:21:05] <DontChuckle98> HE'S GODLIKE
[3:21:12] <+MisterAvry> good parry
[3:21:13] <%jolene_orenji> chat everyone I've seen says those emmi parries are frame perfect does anyone actually have the data on it
[3:21:16] <%HollowedIdjit> Parry QUEEN Samus
[3:21:22] <+scwry> @jolene_orenji ive heard 8 frames
[3:21:42] <Tempmael> eyyyy
[3:21:47] <AngryAsian5> Nice
[3:21:47] <OfficerMods> the screwed up thing about it is that there are varaitons to the timing
[3:22:00] <%CAPSLOCKlive> it's freaky eyeball time
[3:22:04] <OfficerMods> so react within 10th of a second or guess
[3:22:04] <+MisterAvry> brane
[3:22:07] <+ScatFace> I like how these fights are like mini mother brain sections
[3:22:09] <+Beetlewins> These rooms are the only lame part of the game imo
[3:22:10] <AzureSynesthesia> yeah, the emmi parrying isnt a set window
[3:22:14] <OfficerMods> its just like fighting games!
[3:22:22] <Rostichenburg> No Zeebetite in these rooms
[3:22:24] <DoctorMulholland> I love how these things are just total jobber scrub versions of Mother Brain. Daughter Brains if you will.
[3:22:24] <%jolene_orenji> @scwry that sounds a lot more reasonable for a 60 fps game
[3:22:31] <+OniOniOniiii> why doesnt the EMMi just stand outside this room hocHaHa
[3:22:35] <Qsmash_> you do not have parries
[3:22:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:22:38] <TigerClaws12> it's 3 frames after the flash right?
[3:22:39] <roughday25> embrace large weapons
[3:22:41] <+Beetlewins> Does Dread have rollback tho?
[3:22:47] <+MisterAvry> so what's the plot so far?
[3:22:52] <Calek> @Beetlewins it does but not yet
[3:22:58] <%jolene_orenji> @Beetlewins yeah when samus gets the morph ball she can roll back
[3:23:10] <%ennui_on_me> @MisterAvry go to planet. bird vergil beats you up. try to get out
[3:23:10] <Rostichenburg> @MisterAvry Samus got beat up by a mean Bird
[3:23:15] <Jrocy247> Gotta aim first Kappa
[3:23:18] <+D00msDayDan> speed.
[3:23:20] <Dat_Abaddon> LUL
[3:23:26] <@Menitta> aw yeah you got i
[3:23:33] <%HollowedIdjit> @MisterAvry come to ZDR to investigate sightings of the X, get ass beat by a Bird in Power Armor, now we're here
[3:23:34] <@Menitta> ok nvm
[3:23:36] <Jrocy247> Gottem

[3:23:41] <%Prevot> oh shit
[3:23:46] <+ScatFace> @misteravry bird man beat her ass, she recovering her arsenal to beat bird brains
[3:23:48] <%Dr00_PhD> it snatched him out of the air
[3:23:50] <DontChuckle98> Pro tip: Stop dying.
[3:23:51] <+Beetlewins> Woolie knows gamers who use aiming and thinks they're all cowards
[3:23:51] <ElPlasa> THE ANTIAIR
[3:23:52] <%Theycallmenerf> CHRIST
[3:23:53] <AstrodropGaming> Got hit with the airgrab
[3:23:53] <brachydios777> Cocky
[3:23:57] <+ScatFace> oh and the x parasites are walking around somewhere
[3:23:57] <Wafflesisdog> imagine  the sequal metroid dread-locks
[3:23:59] <%Theycallmenerf> IT HAS A FACE SPIKE
[3:24:03] <+OniOniOniiii> @thackattack00 lmao
[3:24:09] <+scwry> no way
[3:24:11] <+VictorVonLouche> Whjy
[3:24:21] <NeroInfinite> If only you had rockets
[3:24:24] <Rostichenburg> Adam did say the X parasite footage might've been staged
[3:24:28] <+CalderGaming> massive greed
[3:24:28] <%ennui_on_me> rockets do nothing here
[3:24:30] <%HollowedIdjit> @NeroInfinite Rockets do nothing to it
[3:24:33] <+IHATREID> just charge the big shot after breaking the face
[3:24:45] <+scwry> yooooo
[3:24:45] <%jolene_orenji> I wonder if they had to cut the death animations so short to keep a T rating cuz it's still pretty graphic for a nintendo game
[3:24:47] <%RyTYoung> woolieS woolieACCIDENT woolieS woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT
[3:24:49] <AzureSynesthesia> clean
[3:24:50] <NotHereToStream> good use of the slide

[3:25:14] <+CalderGaming> CRAWL
[3:25:14] <@Solidus_113> now the game starts
[3:25:14] <@Menitta> nut
[3:25:15] <ElPlasa> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:25:15] <%Sparkseid> banzai
[3:25:16] <kinggum41> fucking finally
[3:25:17] <%Deft_Thought> Ball is LIFE
[3:25:17] <BlackermanZX> YEYEYE
[3:25:18] <%HollowedIdjit> BALL IS LIFE
[3:25:19] <Hammatime8> Yeyeyeye
[3:25:20] <%RyTYoung> BALL
[3:25:22] <Calek> Morph Ball 3 and a half hours in
[3:25:23] <+legitimatejohnathan> No body
[3:25:23] <$brave_sj> Clap!
[3:25:23] <AngryAsian5> BALLIN
[3:25:25] <AstrodropGaming> B A L L
[3:25:28] <+scwry> i kinda love how late it is
[3:25:28] <brachydios777> There it is
[3:25:32] <Monkeyweed21> 3 hours in lol
[3:25:34] <%ennui_on_me> gotta make you reeeeeally want it
[3:25:36] <sizetransmission> let ya nuts hang woolz
[3:25:37] <%Theycallmenerf> SPHERICAL
[3:25:44] <Rostichenburg> This just shows how little Mercury Steam understands Metroid
[3:25:45] <AzureSynesthesia> it integrates into the slide, which is great
[3:25:50] <+ScatFace> item progression in dread is cool changes the formula
[3:25:51] <TerrifyingRei_05> ORB
[3:25:59] <%tank7013> And then they start you with spring ball but make you wait for bombs
[3:26:05] <+ScatFace> no jump, no bomb
[3:26:05] <%OtakuSnake1> There's nothing to sphere but sphere itself woolieLORE
[3:26:06] <+Das_Prints> I guess the slide was enough utility for getting into small places they felt they could delay the morph ball unlock a bit.
[3:26:07] <+MisterAvry> kick ass tho
[3:26:10] <AzureSynesthesia> and you get jump ball for free
[3:26:16] <ExpressNode> Morph hoels
[3:26:18] <Jrocy247> BACKTRACKING
[3:26:24] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Need to find a hole for the ball
[3:26:31] <@Menitta> now you're exactly where I am lmao
[3:26:35] <@Menitta> and i'm lost so yay
[3:26:39] <spawnzie> quic morph ball button ,what a time to be alive
[3:26:39] <ElPlasa> @AzureSynesthesia I actually never really understood why jump ball had to be an upgrade
[3:26:42] <+CalderGaming> you would think that now is the time to canvas everywhere you've been before, but no
[3:27:03] <+scwry> into the belly
[3:27:04] <Rostichenburg> It stopped being a separate upgrade at around Fusion
[3:27:16] <Rudeboy14> Super cozy comfy stream, thanks Woolz majinoSeshun
[3:27:16] <AzureSynesthesia> @AzureSynesthesia it was built into high jump in fusion
[3:27:18] <+scwry> monkaS
[3:27:28] <redwidow1358> ZM made ball jump a high jump combo. Weird.
[3:27:31] <%Prevot> PogChamp
[3:27:32] <+CalderGaming> @AzureSynesthesia it wasn't in the oldest metroid games at all iirc. QOL has come a long way
[3:27:34] <+extradopeness> its probably nothing
[3:27:41] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Not even BALL can endure HEAT
[3:27:43] <Calek> @CalderGaming Super had it
[3:27:45] <+MisterAvry> lol
[3:27:48] <drunken_lemur> Man, imagine a Castlvania game like this
[3:27:49] <%Sparkseid> monkaS
[3:27:49] <%Deft_Thought> monkaS
[3:27:49] <Rostichenburg> @CalderGaming Spring ball has existed since Metroid 2
[3:27:52] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[3:27:54] <+ScatFace> you know who's waiting in there
[3:27:54] <+alphonseisbest> DREAD
[3:27:54] <spawnzie> doesn't like it when you shoot the door
[3:27:55] <+MisterAvry> I'm sure it's a safe room
[3:27:55] <%Prevot> he mad
[3:27:55] <+HakureiIllusion> That roar is iconic
[3:27:56] <AstrodropGaming> leighxOhno
[3:28:01] <NeroInfinite> yes jsut go into the furnace wollie it's fiine.
[3:28:06] <+Das_Prints> Something real mad out there.
[3:28:12] <+scwry> spring ball was super late into super
[3:28:30] <Rostichenburg> It's really hard to get in Super as well
[3:28:48] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Color to Color
[3:28:53] <%ennui_on_me> purple is for routes to new areas
[3:28:55] <AzureSynesthesia> they are color coded to show which ones connect
[3:28:56] <BlackermanZX> color to color teleports
[3:28:56] <pi_in_the_sci> they are a bunch of paired colors
[3:28:57] <+HakureiIllusion> Just the purple rooms on the map
[3:28:59] <+CalderGaming> super had it, NES and Return of Samus (gameboy, not to be confused with Samus Returns) didn't
[3:29:00] <Rostichenburg> Purple rooms are area transitions
[3:29:03] <+ScatFace> go in there you coward
[3:29:10] <+extradopeness> yes yet
[3:29:32] <Rostichenburg> @CalderGaming Return of Samus absolutely has it
[3:29:48] <redwidow1358> The Spring Ball is basically useless in Super tbh, it takes nearly the entire game to get and it isn't really used. It's just bomb jumping but a little faster. The time it takes to obtain is so much more than if you just waited for the bombs to explode.
[3:29:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[3:29:53] <+ScatFace> springball?
[3:30:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:30:08] <%Sparkseid> yes
[3:30:10] <OfficerMods> the second one
[3:30:10] <jett_eyes> woolie no
[3:30:12] <Jrocy247> What?
[3:30:12] <BlackermanZX> teleporting nightmares
[3:30:13] <%RyTYoung> DONT NotLikeThis
[3:30:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE NO
[3:30:16] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[3:30:19] <+scwry> soma
[3:30:19] <%Prevot> its bird magic sshhhhh
[3:30:20] <+D00msDayDan> this process looks like teleportation
[3:30:21] <+MisterAvry> that's why you need wormholes
[3:30:21] <+CalderGaming> ...never mind it WAS in the gameboy version
[3:30:22] <+Beetlewins> same thing
[3:30:22] <AstrodropGaming> no no no... yes
[3:30:23] <SirDogBear> Evil Twin Samus has been done already LUL
[3:30:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Shower thoughts, does it matter?
[3:30:27] <%jolene_orenji> @WoolieVersus she's a video game character, anytime she goes into a new room she's dying and being reborn when she deloads and loads
[3:30:29] <pi_in_the_sci> It's not a meaningful distinction to either potential being
[3:30:29] <AzureSynesthesia> well ghosts exist in metroid so it might be soul transportation
[3:30:30] <Jrocy247> I don't get it
[3:30:30] <Nosphomet> its more like the fly
[3:30:30] <+shinigami40297> imagine believing some shitty teleporter could harm Samus Fucking Aran
[3:30:30] <roughday25> point to point makes me think it's actually her
[3:30:32] <+megaman_sentinel> that so fucked
[3:30:34] <Nocturnment> I wish I was deleted and recreated sigh....
[3:30:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @keiji_maede
[3:30:35] <%RyTYoung> woolieFABRICATION
[3:30:38] <DXLelouch24> Woolie this isnt Star Trek, Galactic Federation tech kicks Star Treks techs ass
[3:30:44] <DXLelouch24> easily
[3:30:48] <roughday25> if it were free range teleportation then it might shred the original
[3:30:52] <OfficerMods> @WoolieVersus chozo tech is more magic than science so its a magical teleport meaning samus is probably safe
[3:30:56] <kinggum41> i keep expecting those statues to come to life and throw hands
[3:31:04] <%Deft_Thought> Maybe a malfunction happens and the teleporter created a second Samus that's still back in that other area!
[3:31:04] <+JonathLP> I just got here. What did Woolie think of Bird Vergil a.k.a Birdgil?
[3:31:05] <DXLelouch24> also yea Chozo tech beats Star Trek Tech
[3:31:07] <+MisterAvry> aw lookit them
[3:31:07] <DXLelouch24> EASY
[3:31:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stop asserting that teleportation thing like there is no possible viewpoint that sidesteps the problem
[3:31:11] <+MisterAvry> nooooo
[3:31:16] <s0nata_ii> is this notorious Other M sympathizer Woolie Madden?
[3:31:17] <%Akizea> oh shit morph ball
[3:31:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How's he doing so far?
[3:31:33] <AzureSynesthesia> chozo ghosts literally exist in prime, so souls are a thing presumably
[3:31:34] <+alphonseisbest> She Ball now
[3:31:36] <Rostichenburg> Getting lost
[3:31:40] <%Deft_Thought> Is it Samus in there? The SA-X. THE BABY? Who knows.
[3:31:52] <DXLelouch24> also shes part chozo,metroid,and human. You cant copy that
[3:31:54] <+ScatFace> chozo ghosts existed in zero mission too
[3:32:06] <+MisterAvry> chosts
[3:32:12] <Rostichenburg> Phantoon might be a ghost who knows
[3:32:12] <%ennui_on_me> if that's the secret then why is it outside the flashing
[3:32:13] <%Prevot> 50% human 50% chozo 50% metroid
[3:32:18] <DXLelouch24> Samus has too much bullshit in her to be copied
[3:32:19] <%komradedog> there is a ttrpg where an alien race has something that humans thought was teleport tech, until they try it and realize it shreds the original and just builds a company with a memory backup, which the humans did not have
[3:32:21] <+scwry> oof
[3:32:25] <DXLelouch24> ergo shes not being killed
[3:32:26] <Darren716> Honestly it's best to ignore secrets til the very end
[3:32:30] <+rbakervv> use your missiles woolie
[3:32:35] <+ScatFace> she had an x parasite eaten by the Metroid DNA too
[3:32:37] <%ennui_on_me> so close...
[3:32:43] <DXLelouch24> maybe if you water bomb jump
[3:32:50] <Rostichenburg> No bombs
[3:32:53] <OfficerMods> forget teleports every time she goes into morph ball for she's converted into energy
[3:32:54] <DXLelouch24> oh yea
[3:32:58] <OfficerMods> think about that
[3:32:58] <DXLelouch24> fucked then
[3:33:01] <%tank7013> @Deft_Thought Depending on what metroid the dna she was infused with came from The Baby might literally be in there
[3:33:02] <+scwry> water bomb jumpin doesnt work either
[3:33:09] <BlackermanZX> morph balls opens a whole lot
[3:33:27] <AzureSynesthesia> @tank7013 fusion directly states that they got the metroid vaccine from the baby metroid
[3:33:34] <+ScatFace> I wish woolie would've gone back to the yelling room
[3:33:43] <%Deft_Thought> @tank7013 psaLiz
[3:33:49] <%RealThiele> i wish i liked this game more
[3:33:52] <Azmodem> Orb
[3:33:55] <+Beetlewins> EMMIs being based off (as in almost entirely ripped off) from AMEE robots in that awful Red Planet movie is hilarious
[3:33:59] <%Deft_Thought> Samus is a secret lizardperson
[3:34:06] <%tank7013> @AzureSynesthesia I thought as much but couldn't remember well enough to be sure
[3:34:22] <+CalderGaming> @Beetlewins TIL
[3:34:30] <+ScatFace> samus is a bird person, not lizard
[3:34:36] <vstpnv> they do not really look similar
[3:34:38] <vstpnv> like
[3:34:39] <+Beetlewins> Samus is a dinosaur
[3:34:40] <pi_in_the_sci> there are a few wide beam door covers as well
[3:34:48] <vstpnv> if you strip half of their details maybe
[3:34:55] <+ScatFace> and birds are the closest relatives to dinosaurs
[3:34:55] <vstpnv> but that won't be an emmi at all
[3:34:59] <+scwry> millRUN
[3:35:00] <Rostichenburg> Turn the lava on
[3:35:03] <vstpnv> jsut like half assed robot
[3:35:16] <%RyTYoung> yeyeye
[3:35:23] <AzureSynesthesia> this is a cool little sequence
[3:35:31] <%Deft_Thought> I was wondering if this was timed
[3:35:33] <theblackbreath> this segment was sooo good
[3:35:33] <%townzzzzz> getting HOT
[3:35:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> too hot
[3:35:37] <AstrodropGaming> leighxChaos leighxChaos
[3:35:53] <Darren716> F

[3:36:17] <+OniOniOniiii> im cookd
[3:36:21] <+Beetlewins> That room is basically to teach you that sliding is still optimal on occasions
[3:36:38] <+scwry> ez
[3:36:56] <Rostichenburg> I feel like this game runs out of cool physics things to do

[3:37:51] <%jinking79> stick to that mistranslation to the end LUL
[3:37:51] <iamnotaparrot> drip aquired
[3:37:53] <%BisoromiBear> fire less hot
[3:37:53] <roughday25> I didn't like the orange and white at first, but it really grew on me
[3:38:03] <gaminglink25> and the gravity suit looks even better
[3:38:03] <UrsaDoom> a sweat suit
[3:38:04] <+OniOniOniiii> god i wish i was her hasO
[3:38:06] <thackattack00> i prefer the blue but the next suit is the real heat tbh
[3:38:16] <+megaman_sentinel> that confidence stance
[3:38:20] <iamnotaparrot> it's just like ps4 Spiderman. add some white and it looks mad schnazzy
[3:38:20] <%ennui_on_me> the final suit is pretty sick too
[3:38:28] <+scwry> You can patty from morph ball too
[3:38:32] <+scwry> parry
[3:38:33] <+witchdoctorpinkish_> the white and gold is sick
[3:38:44] <fairore> @ennui_on_me it's so cool
[3:38:48] <spawnzie> you COULD dip in there
[3:38:48] <CrimsonGargoyle> !motivated
[3:38:48] <@Moobot> @CrimsonGargoyle 2315 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:38:54] <Rostichenburg> Ten missiles for a little lava damage

[3:38:57] <AzureSynesthesia> be quick lol
[3:39:05] <+MisterAvry> rush it?
[3:39:06] <spawnzie> it's fiiiiiiine
[3:39:08] <%Dr00_PhD> do it coward
[3:39:09] <SunsetJack> Not gonna be greedy?
[3:39:10] <BlackermanZX> that item is so bait
[3:39:10] <%RyTYoung> yeah that still hurts
[3:39:14] <+ScatFace> you have enough energy tanks
[3:39:14] <Calek> ayyy
[3:39:15] <+Slattsquatch> Worth
[3:39:16] <+MisterAvry> nice
[3:39:17] <BlackermanZX> nice
[3:39:17] <+Take_2_shots> it's worth
[3:39:18] <UrsaDoom> spicy honey bath
[3:39:20] <Blank9> ballsy
[3:39:21] <%RyTYoung> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[3:39:24] <SunsetJack> Worth itt
[3:39:25] <+polothegreatest> yeyeyeye
[3:39:36] <+scwry> SourPls
[3:39:48] <hassanico2> yo is he on one E tank?
[3:39:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh boy, this game fucking goes places
[3:40:06] <+ScatFace> he has two
[3:40:07] <hassanico2> Ah I just saw the 2nd one
[3:40:17] <+Beetlewins> @hassanico2 No he has more he just went for a lava bath
[3:40:26] <Rostichenburg> 2 and 1/4
[3:40:27] <%Prevot> this game looks really good, but the lava looks terrible
[3:40:29] <+scwry> can go back to roar room too
[3:40:30] <+RadioSpirit> You think this means they'll give Samus a counter in the next smash?
[3:40:47] <+ScatFace> no, Samus returns had a parry too
[3:40:58] <fairore> s@radiospirit maybe in the next game
[3:40:58] <+ScatFace> her moveset didn't change since melee
[3:41:00] <%Prevot> next smash? like what, 8 years from now
[3:41:01] <%ennui_on_me> the future of smash will just be samurai shodown
[3:41:13] <fairore> @radiospirit if they decide on it
[3:41:13] <KyberNasse> the Counter punch would be neat in smash
[3:41:19] <+ScatFace> Samus returns was released prior to ultimate
[3:41:25] <+Beetlewins> I genuinely think the next Smash will only have like 15 fighters
[3:41:30] <%RealThiele> counter punch being the best way to kill stuff is :(
[3:41:43] <%Theycallmenerf> Smash hasn‚Äôt made any original smash game only characters, has it?
[3:41:57] <+ScatFace> yes, he's called captain falcon
[3:42:06] <%RealThiele> oof
[3:42:07] <%fetrigon> @realthiele why? melee cool
[3:42:10] <%BisoromiBear> @ScatFace that hurts
[3:42:11] <+MisterAvry> lil dip there
[3:42:21] <+ScatFace> f zero is dead and he didn't have a character model
[3:42:28] <+Das_Prints> @theycallmenerf not any playable ones. Just things like the bosses for the story modes.
[3:42:30] <%fetrigon> see cool
[3:42:31] <+scwry> big roar
[3:42:32] <AzureSynesthesia> this part is so good
[3:42:33] <redwidow1358> ROAR
[3:42:36] <%RealThiele> melee isnt cool when its waaaaay stronger than just using beams and missiles which are supposed to be samus' thing
[3:42:45] <+MisterAvry> spicy oolaid
[3:42:51] <+MisterAvry> *koolaid
[3:42:54] <Blank9> freeaim
[3:42:57] <NeroInfinite> the forbidden orange drink
[3:43:01] <+thelovingfool> anyone know if ingame timer stops in pause menue?
[3:43:02] <+polothegreatest> map lies
[3:43:04] <+rbakervv> you missed
[3:43:09] <+megaman_sentinel> lol
[3:43:09] <+rbakervv> aim
[3:43:10] <%Theycallmenerf> @das_prints Would be cool if they had their own Smash fighter in Smash Bros whatever the next game is called.
[3:43:11] <%Dr00_PhD> timer stops
[3:43:15] <+ScatFace> I like how melee works in dread compared to Samus returns where it slowed down the game's pace gard
[3:43:18] <+thelovingfool> thanks
[3:43:44] <+scwry> Boss door monkaS
[3:43:51] <AzureSynesthesia> @ScatFace absolutely agreed. its very snappy and aggressive now
[3:43:53] <+Das_Prints> @theycallmenerf it could be. Although considering the identity of that game is so tied up in being a crossover fighter I‚Äôd be surprised if they ever went in that direction.
[3:43:55] <+MisterAvry> but how
[3:43:57] <+vaderxyz1970> That missle sounded so sad
[3:43:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:43:58] <+CherteuseKapibara> wall wart
[3:44:01] <+thelovingfool> if only you could shoot through walls
[3:44:21] <%Deft_Thought> Punch the dick door
[3:44:29] <DoctorMulholland> LET'S GOOOOOO

[3:44:43] <+Das_Prints> Big and mad
[3:44:43] <%Deft_Thought> Wait
[3:44:43] <+ScatFace> no really, captain falcon's standing stance is really similar to the prototype character in the smash concept game before they added the Nintendo characters
[3:44:44] <%Deft_Thought> WHAT
[3:44:49] <DirtyMerlin> Whuddup Woolie. Dread is incredible, i just broke down and bought it. No regrets so far.
[3:44:51] <%Deft_Thought> NO FUCKING WAY

[3:45:09] <DoctorMulholland> It's been a while old friend
[3:45:10] <%fetrigon> so much sas
[3:45:10] <+LazyAss24Seven> good shit
[3:45:10] <+vaderxyz1970> @thelovingfool Dude The Auger Gun from Resistance was my favorite gun that gen
[3:45:10] <@Menitta> Her body language is so good
[3:45:11] <Jrocy247> SAMUS'S SO COOL
[3:45:12] <%Deft_Thought> Why is this asshole down here?
[3:45:15] <AncelDeLambert> I love her, I love how she reacts to EVERY boss
[3:45:15] <%Theycallmenerf> @das_prints Besides adding the next runner up from that poll with Sora, I think it would be cool that Smash have an original character.
[3:45:18] <NotHereToStream> get fucked kraid
[3:45:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @redwidow1358
[3:45:20] <+MisterAvry> bully Kraid, the boss
[3:45:23] <AncelDeLambert> this game is like the ultimate apology for Other M
[3:45:25] <Rostichenburg> I hate that he's just here for no reason
[3:45:34] <Onatamana> Samus hasn't been in the room more than 2 seconds and she's already done with Kraid's bullshit.
[3:45:35] <%RyTYoung> Samus is 100% the most badass female protag;
[3:45:37] <Ethel9727> This is hilarious
[3:45:37] <bipdipper> kraid got that george lucas chin
[3:45:42] <%Prevot> they finally did it
[3:45:47] <+scwry> This boss is a filter
[3:45:49] <KyberNasse> Samus' sass is badass
[3:45:50] <Saltmeisterr> just a random kraid
[3:45:51] <%RealThiele> well i mean zebes being his homeworld i could see chozo bringing monster DNA around the galaxy with them
[3:45:52] <+MisterAvry> ew, toenails
[3:45:54] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg If you look the extras, the reason is because Birdgil is a badass
[3:45:56] <Saltmeisterr> no biggy
[3:46:01] <Savatewolf> Kraid is trapped in the cuck shed
[3:46:15] <+Beetlewins> Remember your abcs: Always Be Chucking missiles
[3:46:17] <fairore> @rostichenburg weirdchamp
[3:46:19] <%Prevot> so does kraid being here imply he's chozo made like mother brain?
[3:46:27] <Rostichenburg> @hollumdusk Doesn't really explain how he dug him out of the ruins of that planet
[3:46:28] <%RealThiele> seems so
[3:46:29] <AzureSynesthesia> if you look at the backgrounds in the D sector, they are cloning monsters
[3:46:33] <+scwry> @Prevot that was always true
[3:46:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Man is still reflexively jumping for his shots instead of aiming up slightly
[3:46:34] <+vaderxyz1970> Kraid using Tusk as a stand
[3:46:40] <+MisterAvry> oooh he hurting
[3:46:51] <+alphonseisbest> Hey chat, whose the Director for DREAD?
[3:46:57] <+scwry> mother brain is a chozo computer
[3:46:58] <hollumdusk> @Rostichenburg I mean, we didn't questioned how he and Ridley, or Mother Brain survived the first game, why do it now?
[3:47:01] <hassanico2> Sakamoto IIRC?
[3:47:03] <BlackermanZX> no damage
[3:47:04] <+ScatFace> some Spaniard
[3:47:19] <+ScatFace> remember this is a mercury steam game
[3:47:23] <Rostichenburg> @hollumdusk Cause they kept adding stories
[3:47:24] <+ihateyouo> SHOOT HIS face
[3:47:25] <+scwry> never use pellets on bosses
[3:47:28] <+extradopeness> charge beam, woolie
[3:47:30] <gaminglink25> sakamoto was is producer but not director
[3:47:37] <%RealThiele> tink tink
[3:47:40] <Rostichenburg> @ScatFace It's actually a Japanese guy
[3:47:43] <+thelovingfool> nails is the best time to attack i feel
[3:47:45] <roughday25> now he's getting it
[3:47:50] <BlackermanZX> only charge shot and missile
[3:47:50] <+alphonseisbest> so NO-ONE knows who directed this? shame
[3:47:55] <OfficerMods> japanese producer is a little different from a western one
[3:47:55] <spawnzie> he aint free
[3:47:55] <+MisterAvry> that shit looked hard
[3:48:03] <Monkeyweed21> Kraid aint free
[3:48:04] <+ihateyouo> like in super and zero mission
[3:48:04] <%Prevot> woolie not doing great with the aiming huh
[3:48:06] <Jaller101514> This boss is one of the tougher ones in this game
[3:48:06] <+legitimatejohnathan> charge beam to his closed face forces him to open up
[3:48:09] <+RadioSpirit> free kraid
[3:48:12] <jett_eyes> how is Kraid even here
[3:48:14] <AstrodropGaming> leighxRIP
[3:48:14] <hollumdusk> @alphonseisbest Isn't the same director from SR?
[3:48:18] <Qsmash_> pretty sure Sakamoto directed this
[3:48:23] <hollumdusk> The one from the Three House
[3:48:23] <OfficerMods> japanese producers can look at a product go "nah this sucks either rebuild from the ground up or can it" on a whim
[3:48:27] <NeroInfinite> He falld own into lava is how he here
[3:48:27] <gaminglink25> the director is with mercury steam iirc
[3:48:30] <+scwry> this is a hard one, its a filter
[3:48:33] <Rostichenburg> Fumi Hayashi is the Director
[3:48:35] <+alphonseisbest> @hollumdusk is it, idk thats why im asking tbj
[3:48:38] <+alphonseisbest> *tbh
[3:48:38] <DoctorMulholland> This one got me a couple times. Been a good while since I played a Nintendo game where bosses felt like bosses.
[3:48:46] <+ScatFace> Metroid Dread: Directed by Takehiko Hosokawa, Jos√© Luis M√°rquez
[3:48:46] <+CalderGaming> wikipedia sez: Jose Luis M√°rquez and Fumi Hayashi co-directed
[3:48:48] <nintega010> @jett_eyes. i think its another kraid imo
[3:48:51] <+alphonseisbest> @Rostichenburg cheers
[3:48:54] <+MisterAvry> ayyy
[3:48:57] <redwidow1358> This one definitely took a minute, but if you manage to sequence break and get bombs early, a cool thing opens up
[3:48:57] <Rostichenburg> Sakamoto is the Producer, Jose Alveres is the Creative Director
[3:48:58] <+keiji_maede> THAT WAS FAST
[3:48:58] <Jrocy247> So weird he's making that noise
[3:48:59] <%RealThiele> directors are        Jose Luis M√°rquez     Fumi Hayashi
[3:49:01] <+MisterAvry> phase 2
[3:49:03] <+ScatFace> Sakamoto wasn't involved as a director
[3:49:07] <kikoeru_san> Woolie going in hard
[3:49:09] <bipdipper> samus is just gonna let this happen
[3:49:13] <hassanico2> nasty tummy...
[3:49:14] <AzureSynesthesia> it's straight up a kraid clone based on the environmental clues and what adam implies
[3:49:17] <%RealThiele> the Krussy
[3:49:17] <UrsaDoom> HUGE GUTS
[3:49:20] <+FuqBoiSlim> Sakamoto was only producer. GOOD
[3:49:21] <%Dr00_PhD> Krussy
[3:49:21] <Bazal68k> DansGame
[3:49:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> get im in the tummy hole
[3:49:23] <NeroInfinite> shoot hsi purple gut
[3:49:26] <thackattack00> so gross
[3:49:28] <+Beetlewins> gross
[3:49:28] <+stoicman90> this was developed by a spanish team
[3:49:34] <prime_name> You can break those cuffs
[3:49:34] <jett_eyes> huh, weird
[3:49:34] <UrsaDoom> shoot his gutssy
[3:49:39] <spawnzie> don't talk about his hole he's self conicous

[3:49:46] <+OniOniOniiii> monkaS Kraid should get that checked out
[3:49:49] <p3niletrauma> What a hemorrhoid
[3:49:53] <Rostichenburg> I don't remember Adam mentioning this at all and I checked cause I wanted an explanation
[3:49:55] <Savatewolf> Samus 360
[3:49:56] <Treasure_Vault> The bomb kill on kraid is SICC
[3:49:59] <+MisterAvry> he's nasty
[3:50:05] <+JonathLP> Are we suppose to backseat or not?
[3:50:13] <%RealThiele> minimal backseating
[3:50:14] <+MisterAvry> generally no
[3:50:15] <Buttku> not
[3:50:17] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> no
[3:50:17] <+scwry> still very similar to old kraid techniques too
[3:50:18] <%Dr00_PhD> Never unless he asks
[3:50:18] <DaCheekyOne> This reminds me of the "fuck you" lady monster from DmC
[3:50:21] <SunsetJack> Let him figure out the boss.
[3:50:21] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie will figure it out
[3:50:22] <gaminglink25> woolie will figure it out
[3:50:23] <+thelovingfool> hope he gets the counter for this fight
[3:50:24] <roughday25> there's a cool counter chance if you can climb those nails
[3:50:25] <AstrodropGaming> @JonathLP Woolie will figure it out
[3:50:25] <+CherteuseKapibara> "woolie will find a way"
[3:50:26] <+JonathLP> that's kewl, won't say anythinga bout the boss then
[3:50:29] <hollumdusk> @FuqBoiSlim Hey, have some respect, Other M or not, he still directed Super, Fusion and ZM. He is a good director, just not a specially good Writer.
[3:50:35] <AzureSynesthesia> @Rostichenburg Adam says that the D area is for bioresearch and if you look in the background of one of the rooms they are literally making another kraid
[3:50:36] <+ScatFace> this fight is a recreation of the old kraid fight
[3:50:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> @hollumdusk no
[3:50:40] <UrsaDoom> only backseat if he ask for it seems to be the general custom
[3:51:05] <AthenaAegis> Woolie VS....KRAID WutFace
[3:51:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:51:06] <%asakura_ayase> Some of these bosses don‚Äôt mess around. So it‚Äôs not unheard of to take multiple attempts at one
[3:51:15] <+extradopeness> there are never any circumstances where people are "supposed to backseat" thanks
[3:51:25] <Rostichenburg> Should've been a mini Kraid like Metroid 1
[3:51:38] <+MisterAvry> feed him missiles yum yum
[3:51:44] <%RealThiele> i still like how super had the mini karid to fool you
[3:51:52] <%RealThiele> Kraid*
[3:51:56] <spawnzie> bouncy balls of death
[3:51:56] <+OniOniOniiii> man they sure do have a lot of eagles on ZDR
[3:52:01] <roughday25> that infected spot on his gut is so nasty
[3:52:08] <UrsaDoom> getting closer
[3:52:09] <+dreamcastiszombie> BibleThump
[3:52:10] <+ihateyouo> kraid got hands
[3:52:10] <+Beetlewins> Yeah no wonder he's angry
[3:52:12] <DoctorMulholland> smh
[3:52:12] <Rostichenburg> No one played Metroid 1 far enough to get fooled by mini Kraid in Super
[3:52:12] <+ScatFace> let the dude have fun with the game, he'll very likely die multiple times against some of the bosses
[3:52:14] <+JoeyGrizzle> @extradopeness unless specifically asked for ?
[3:52:16] <kikoeru_san> the purple stomach anus
[3:52:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> I guess he never tests what boss parts you can use uncharged beams on
[3:52:18] <Darren716> Just gotta remember the old fight
[3:52:19] <+MisterAvry> Kraid is fkn gross for sure
[3:52:21] <jett_eyes> yo could you use those three things that shoot out of him as platforms?
[3:52:35] <+rbakervv> @jett_eyes no
[3:52:36] <+extradopeness> @joeygrizzle Thats not what backseating is tho
[3:52:40] <%jinking79> he almost found the sweet spot to aim at
[3:52:45] <KyberNasse> Figuring it out by yourself is part of the experience
[3:52:49] <%fetrigon> aaayyy he got it
[3:52:57] <+legitimatejohnathan> @jett_eyes yes
[3:52:57] <+s0ki_> i died a lot to this fight
[3:53:06] <+extradopeness> if someone asks for help that's one thing
[3:53:07] <+OniOniOniiii> so are Kraids like bioweapons or sumn, why they keep making them
[3:53:19] <AncelDeLambert> just keep spamming missiles, the projectiles always drop plenty
[3:53:22] <prime_name> Kraid is a space pirate
[3:53:23] <Rostichenburg> There's no explanation to Kraid he just is
[3:53:41] <%RealThiele> Chozo were like i want a spikey lizard guy ima make one, poof Kraid
[3:53:42] <%Prevot> the chozo and making bioweapons, when did that ever work out
[3:53:42] <+dreamcastiszombie> NICE
[3:53:48] <AzureSynesthesia> nice!
[3:53:48] <jett_eyes> ha ha, nice
[3:53:49] <+scwry> the nails get everyone
[3:53:50] <+OniOniOniiii> i've never seen it bounce back in thats so gross
[3:53:54] <roughday25> nice!
[3:54:01] <roughday25> the mixup!
[3:54:04] <%notsoy> schmixxxed
[3:54:06] <+CalderGaming> this is what I was referring to earlier when I mentioned a boss fight that seems un-MercurySteam-y. Not a lot of modern mechanics, a lot of just shootshootshoot
[3:54:06] <jett_eyes> oh shit
[3:54:07] <+MisterAvry> he tried to edge his spikes
[3:54:13] <OfficerMods> Get caught with the ex belly tumor
[3:54:14] <UrsaDoom> this is very much an upgrade over the Super Metroid fight
[3:54:14] <+ScatFace> Samus aran @prevot
[3:54:15] <+extradopeness> whoa he did it the cool way
[3:54:17] <+ihateyouo> kraid got belly parasites
[3:54:19] <+rbakervv> you CAN duck you know
[3:54:19] <+scwry> if you have bombs, theres a special way to kill this boss
[3:54:20] <OfficerMods> good use of meter from kraid
[3:54:20] <spawnzie> mixed by the damage threshold
[3:54:23] <Treasure_Vault> Canon Samus is a 100% TAS
[3:54:28] <DoctorMulholland> Good fight, really fun take on the Kraid formula
[3:54:29] <+vaderxyz1970> Its nice quality of life that they start you outside the boss door
[3:54:32] <Treasure_Vault> Glitchless*
[3:54:33] <ScreamLord> I dunno how Craid is here, but it's cool
[3:54:37] <Rostichenburg> This visual design feels very un Mercury Steam like
[3:54:39] <+OniOniOniiii> omg lit his ass up
[3:54:49] <fairore> @treasure_vault what's tas ?
[3:54:52] <+dreamcastiszombie> be careful BibleThump
[3:54:57] <%Prevot> this game has tough bosses but it's very forgiving
[3:54:57] <kikoeru_san> can't wait for speedruners make this fight look easy
[3:55:00] <+ScatFace> alot of people skipped on return of samus huh
[3:55:02] <Treasure_Vault> @fairore Tool Assisted Speedrun
[3:55:06] <OfficerMods> they already have
[3:55:22] <Treasure_Vault> @fairore Basically, programmed perfect speedruns
[3:55:22] <OfficerMods> there is a speed run specfic kill for this fight
[3:55:24] <+MisterAvry> oh I bet that parry looks dope
[3:55:27] <Rostichenburg> @ScatFace It was on 3DS late in it's life
[3:55:27] <redwidow1358> Would love to see a QoL feature where game over in a boss has "Restart from fight" "Restart from checkpoint" and "Quit"
[3:55:28] <fairore> @treasure_vault oh lol thanks you
[3:55:32] <Savatewolf> Kraid has a cool parry
[3:55:32] <+scwry> awh
[3:55:35] <roughday25> close!
[3:55:39] <AzureSynesthesia> the kraid parry is real neat
[3:55:42] <kikoeru_san> Woolie you have to dodge
[3:55:44] <%RyTYoung> PARRY DAT SHIT
[3:55:45] <taquito_blade> how you liking it so far?
[3:55:47] <pi_in_the_sci> You want that parry
[3:55:50] <Darren716> Nah stomach takes normal damage
[3:55:55] <DoctorMulholland> Just laser the belly
[3:55:56] <Monkeyweed21> the stomach is weak to normal shots
[3:55:57] <spawnzie> you REALLY want those boss parries
[3:55:58] <Nosphomet> this fights some good shit honestly
[3:56:02] <%RealThiele> yea samus is WAY squishy compared to other metroids, even squishier than fusion
[3:56:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Beam spam on stomach can kill the projectiles if you aim well
[3:56:13] <ScreamLord> Just mash Y like Pat would
[3:56:14] <fairore> God this theme rocks
[3:56:17] <prime_name> The boss parries in this game go hard, especially the last boss
[3:56:22] <MAX116030> Chat does he know what to do on success parry sequence?
[3:56:30] <+CalderGaming> nope
[3:56:44] <+D00msDayDan> @MAX116030 he beat the other boss so i think he'll figure it out
[3:56:44] <+scwry> hopefully he doesnt fire pellets on a parry
[3:56:46] <fairore> I thinks so
[3:56:46] <spawnzie> he got it during the first boss
[3:56:50] <Rostichenburg> Some how throwing his big nails is grosser in 3d
[3:56:58] <fairore> he was doing  on the first  boss
[3:56:59] <%fetrigon> cool boss parry animations give good dopamine hit ye üòã
[3:57:15] <+scwry> NOOO
[3:57:16] <ScreamLord> I never even thought to use the belly spikes to go up to the head like that
[3:57:18] <thackattack00> NOOOO
[3:57:19] <+dreamcastiszombie> YEAH
[3:57:19] <DoctorMulholland> YAAAASSSSSS
[3:57:19] <roughday25> nooooo!
[3:57:22] <prime_name> rip animation
[3:57:23] <+ihateyouo> ounch
[3:57:23] <BlackermanZX> noo missed the animation
[3:57:25] <%RyTYoung> I didn't know you could do that :O :O :O
[3:57:27] <MAX116030> ?
[3:57:28] <+MisterAvry> that was sick
[3:57:30] <%jinking79> just trail and error on getting used to it
[3:57:31] <+scwry> he didnt fire after the parry
[3:57:34] <thackattack00> he fucked it up
[3:57:35] <roughday25> rip nero grab...
[3:57:39] <%RyTYoung> climb up that way I mesn
[3:57:56] <%RyTYoung> pray for the parry
[3:57:59] <+MisterAvry> damn those toenails
[3:58:00] <AthenaAegis> Damn. Big Boy Kraid upped his game this installment
[3:58:04] <%RyTYoung> unluck
[3:58:05] <MAX116030> How he did right yet screwed it up?
[3:58:08] <+JoeyGrizzle> you got this
[3:58:08] <%RyTYoung> unlucky*
[3:58:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[3:58:09] <BlackermanZX> missed the animation dang
[3:58:09] <+rbakervv> you have to laser to nails
[3:58:12] <kikoeru_san> betting the whole ass farm on that one
[3:58:12] <Treasure_Vault> Man it sure is neat that Metroid.
[3:58:15] <+ScatFace> fire after the parry for cool fun times
[3:58:15] <+dreamcastiszombie> you're getting betterüëçüëç
[3:58:16] <@Menitta> not an easy fight
[3:58:19] <+scwry> @MAX116030 He didnt fire after the parry
[3:58:22] <+Das_Prints> He has to fire after the party for cool stuff.
[3:58:30] <%JoeyGrizzle> JoeyGrizzle subscribed with Prime. 
[3:58:32] <+Das_Prints> He‚Äôs getting there though.
[3:58:32] <+Rekinsinn> can you actually melee the claws? I feel like I tried that and it didn't work
[3:58:38] <+extradopeness> VoteYea
[3:58:38] <fairore> you  got this woolie
[3:58:42] <%fetrigon> Lots of love and passion went into this game
[3:58:51] <MAX116030> @scwry @Das_Prints thx
[3:58:51] <%Prevot> kraid might be big and strong and all, but I fought a tiny bug later that's way harder LUL
[3:58:52] <%RyTYoung> these bosses don't mess around
[3:59:09] <+scwry> he's got it
[3:59:12] <roughday25> nice cleanup that phase
[3:59:20] <+ihateyouo> fuck
[3:59:24] <redwidow1358> They don't mess-troid around-read
[3:59:32] <%RyTYoung> it's cool you can get another shot
[3:59:40] <scrumbotime> I don't like Kraid's Projectile Holes at all
[3:59:41] <%Artoo__The_Me> No spoilers, just saying that I literally just 100% dread and I loved it
[3:59:43] <+ihateyouo> fuck again
[3:59:46] <fairore> @redwidow1358 fucking  booo
[3:59:55] <spawnzie> the overhead is rough
[4:00:02] <+dreamcastiszombie> this boss music is tripping me up LUL LUL
[4:00:03] <%xiccy> this fight was a bitch and a half
[4:00:03] <+scwry> that top nail gets everyone LUL
[4:00:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @redwidow1358 I want your gamer card on my desk by the end of the day
[4:00:17] <+MisterAvry> I would struggle all day with those toenails
[4:00:19] <roughday25> I had trouble with the same one man
[4:00:34] <fairore> @dreamcastiszombie is this new lingo
[4:00:35] <%RyTYoung> yeah I try to switch to normal shots to get rid of the nails
[4:00:47] <+scwry> fuck

[4:00:57] <%RealThiele> GG
[4:00:58] <%fetrigon> YEEEEAAAAH KomodoHype
[4:00:58] <DoctorMulholland> Looks like you got hi,
[4:01:02] <+Rasheedt> KomodoHype
[4:01:04] <BlackermanZX> you didnt do the correct parry aww
[4:01:05] <AstrodropGaming> OWLgg
[4:01:07] <Monkeyweed21> aww that sucks for woolie
[4:01:08] <+MisterAvry> ice cold
[4:01:08] <+JupiterDjin> casual side step
[4:01:08] <DoctorMulholland> I didn't get the cool parry either tbh
[4:01:11] <%RyTYoung> unlucky you didn't get the parry , I didn't either NotLikeThis
[4:01:13] <+OniOniOniiii> that side step
[4:01:15] <+scwry> forgot to shoot again
[4:01:16] <+dreamcastiszombie> LOOK AT THE HEELS
[4:01:18] <Deadpool2450> samus dont flinch
[4:01:18] <Darren716> Wait how does he die from the lava now?
[4:01:21] <+dreamcastiszombie> LUL LUL
[4:01:21] <%RealThiele> RIP Crocomire
[4:01:23] <drunken_lemur> Crocomire
[4:01:24] <Darren716> Wasnt he living in it?
[4:01:25] <+vaderxyz1970> How deep is that pit?
[4:01:25] <+StatesmanPrimal> samus is so cool fuck
[4:01:26] <+Beetlewins> that side step was rad
[4:01:26] <kikoeru_san> the sidestep she didn't give a FUCK
[4:01:29] <+MisterAvry> was that not it?
[4:01:31] <Qsmash_> he can't swim
[4:01:32] <AzureSynesthesia> i guess kraid cant swim and was being held up by the cables lol
[4:01:33] <roughday25> yeah, atleast you got the kill though!
[4:01:38] <+scwry> he got the timing, he didnt shoot after
[4:01:39] <Treasure_Vault> There's also a secret quick kill on kraid
[4:01:39] <spawnzie> yeah you gotta just do a regular shot right away
[4:01:40] <+OUTheTeam> there's a unique animation if you sequence break this boss
[4:01:44] <+D00msDayDan> üëç
[4:01:45] <%RyTYoung> He did parry it but it didn't go into the animatoon
[4:01:46] <prime_name> You just gotta shoot after the parry
[4:01:47] <thackattack00> you have to shoot after it
[4:01:49] <BlackermanZX> you have to shot after
[4:01:49] <+Slattsquatch> You just need to shoot after parrying
[4:01:50] <+ScatFace> you have to fire after parrying
[4:01:51] <LinguiniAlfredo> gotta shoot after
[4:01:52] <+StatesmanPrimal> i think it was just wonky
[4:01:53] <+MisterAvry> ahhh
[4:01:56] <OfficerMods> and don't use the aim button
[4:01:57] <roughday25> you've gotta be tight with the followup attack after parries
[4:01:58] <%tank7013> You have to shoot normally when it gives you the lined up shot. can't go straight into missile
[4:01:59] <AthenaAegis> Lol, Crocomire is "We have Kraid at home" Kappa
[4:02:01] <MAX116030> you have to shoot right after
[4:02:01] <ScreamLord> Imagine if Nintendo had a Metroid character action game made that wasn't dogshit like Other M
[4:02:02] <+MisterAvry> it's a 2 step process
[4:02:02] <jett_eyes> well he was able to kill it regardless
[4:02:03] <+Beetlewins> A lot of the way Samus is reacting to bosses in this seems like a reaction to how she was perceived in Other M
[4:02:05] <OfficerMods> if you use the aim button after parry it won't do it
[4:02:06] <+OniOniOniiii> i like how they were just tutoring Kraid in lava for reasons
[4:02:12] <%sporeian94> I wish Samus was my GF
[4:02:13] <+StatesmanPrimal> @AthenaAegis LUL
[4:02:21] <drunken_lemur> Metroid: Diffusion
[4:02:22] <Monkeyweed21> samus does a Nero boss buster
[4:02:23] <Treasure_Vault> If you do a sequence break for morph bombs, there's a secret quick kill scenee for Kraid
[4:02:26] <%RealThiele> Muda Muda beamu
[4:02:32] <+OniOniOniiii> wait the lava is probably a failsafe nvm
[4:02:33] <Rostichenburg> @Beetlewins 100% that's what I think
[4:02:37] <%RyTYoung> reload the fight? Kappa
[4:02:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Man Woolie u are blasting thru this
[4:02:48] <+MisterAvry> I'm sure there are more enemies that require that later huh?
[4:02:50] <%rottingpastry> always shoot after parry
[4:02:58] <KnivesEve> did i miss the boss fight?
[4:03:03] <BlackermanZX> nah

[4:03:42] <%tank7013> There was a Kappa chat it's not that one guys fault LUL
[4:03:43] <Mvrdok_> Edit it in post Kappa
[4:03:46] <jett_eyes> one guy needs to calm down
[4:03:49] <%xiccy> the moment's gone
[4:03:51] <Jrocy247> Dude about to ruin a WHOLE playthrough to see one little thing
[4:03:53] <MAX116030> It is interesting though. Seems like Devs give option to skip full parry animation for the player. I wonder ig its for speedrunners
[4:03:54] <%Akizea> diffusion beam hits enemies underground btw
[4:03:58] <KyberNasse> Begone goblins
[4:04:03] <%jinking79> now he knows for the other bosses
[4:04:11] <Calek> @MAX116030 parry animations do a lot of damage
[4:04:12] <@Menitta> man he really got hype at that thing
[4:04:14] <%RyTYoung> chill dudes it's a suggestion not a demand
[4:04:14] <AstrodropGaming> Mind goblins leave
[4:04:23] <%RealThiele> yea Parry animations are THE way to kill
[4:04:31] <%Dr00_PhD> nah you shot there too

[4:05:56] <+D00msDayDan> thank you woolie i have now inserted it into my brain
[4:06:03] <%RyTYoung> I haven't even watched it myself, I wasn't trying to make Woolie reload his game, I didn't even know if he made a save or not
[4:06:07] <MAX116030> bets on him screw up on other bosses parry?
[4:06:14] <prime_name> I love how she axe kicks his mouth open
[4:06:16] <Treasure_Vault> There's another secret kill for kraid that is siqq
[4:06:17] <+extradopeness> i dont blame you woolie i did the same thing
[4:06:17] <roughday25> complete with spamming shots the whole time
[4:06:21] <fairore> be careful  with the spoiler  on YouTube woolie
[4:06:22] <+ScatFace> no worries kid, don't try to justify jt
[4:06:24] <OfficerMods> DARE YOU ENTER THIS REALM
[4:06:25] <+ScatFace> it*
[4:06:27] <spawnzie> you can BUT
[4:06:33] <%RealThiele> its very tricky
[4:06:37] <%Dr00_PhD> doable but dangerous
[4:06:38] <Savatewolf> Don't be a coward, even I got that
[4:06:40] <%RyTYoung> @scatface bruh I'm 27

[4:06:51] <+MisterAvry> yeahhh
[4:06:57] <roughday25> that's such a good pose
[4:07:05] <%RealThiele> Hi adam
[4:07:07] <+Slattsquatch> The character animations in this game are really good
[4:07:08] <+scwry> If you sequenced break to bombs, you can fire yourself into kraids stomach and lay bombs inside him, mercury steam even made a special cutscene for sequence breaking
[4:07:08] <Rostichenburg> I wish the amiibo was in that pose
[4:07:08] <KnivesEve> yeah youtube algorithm might give woolie a spoiler
[4:07:11] <%Deft_Thought> She cool as hell
[4:07:11] <spawnzie> SHE'S SO COOL
[4:07:17] <%Prevot> MrDestructoid
[4:07:20] <MAX116030> to quote Maximilian "Give huge raise to whoever animated Samus"
[4:07:21] <+ScatFace> no worries kid, you'll still be a kid T 40
[4:07:27] <Monkeyweed21> its a good ass suit
[4:07:28] <+OniOniOniiii> playing this game, i say "shes so cool" every 30 odd minutes
[4:07:38] <+polothegreatest> "hey cool metroid trailer", Ending ruined by the tubes TableHere FlipThis
[4:07:40] <+RadioSpirit> Reactivating generators ; dead by daylight
[4:07:50] <+StatesmanPrimal> biological research, that's what i do PogChamp
[4:07:55] <Jrocy247> The lightning and atmosphere in this game is so dead on. Mercury Steam did a good job.
[4:07:57] <%RyTYoung> okay dude whatever
[4:07:59] <kinggum41> I kinda wish Adam  wasn't a text to speech voice
[4:08:01] <jett_eyes> yo wait, when did she become orange agin
[4:08:04] <AzureSynesthesia> its the BSL station all over again lol
[4:08:08] <jett_eyes> i missed that
[4:08:15] <+cvp5127> how far is he?
[4:08:18] <+megaman_sentinel> I wonder what there researching
[4:08:25] <+scwry> @kinggum41 if he had human emotion, the game would lose its sense of isolation
[4:08:25] <%RealThiele> spooks time
[4:08:26] <spawnzie> @cvp5127 just beat Kraid
[4:08:28] <+Slattsquatch> @cvp5127 Just beat Kraid
[4:08:30] <KnivesEve> oh you can destroy those!?
[4:08:33] <+ScatFace> he got the varia suit before the kraid fight
[4:08:40] <+StatesmanPrimal> @megaman_sentinel probably some evil bullshit
[4:08:43] <%RealThiele> Walls lie in metroid ALL the time
[4:08:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> big whiffs
[4:09:01] <AstrodropGaming> F
[4:09:02] <ScreamLord> They change up the timing every time
[4:09:07] <%jinking79> i forget Samus human before Fusion right ?
[4:09:12] <%Deft_Thought> Awww shit, new Gon In 60 Seconds went up
[4:09:19] <AzureSynesthesia> samus was human with chozo dna prior to fusion
[4:09:20] <Rostichenburg> Human with a little Chozo DNA
[4:09:21] <+PA_august> there's two chances to parry, the hand flash and the eye flash
[4:09:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> every emmi is different, it's like furbys @WoolieVersus
[4:09:33] <+scwry> a little chozo dna, a little metroid dna
[4:09:36] <mothdude> F
[4:09:42] <%Deft_Thought> I must learn more about the Madden/WOLF saga
[4:09:42] <%jinking79> ok thank chat
[4:09:44] <%RealThiele> the eye flash parry timing is harder than the hand parry tho
[4:09:50] <+ScatFace> @jinking79 she had Metroid and chozo DNA before fusion but is still a human
[4:09:53] <+dreamcastiszombie> WutFace
[4:10:03] <AthenaAegis> Samus can have a little Chozo dna.....as a treat
[4:10:12] <+dreamcastiszombie> RUN
[4:10:14] <+StatesmanPrimal> @ScatFace if i remember right she got metroid dna in fusion to save her from X
[4:10:24] <Asuterisuku> The Metroid DNA was new to Fusion though.
[4:10:26] <redwidow1358> RIP
[4:10:28] <redwidow1358> lol
[4:10:29] <Jaller101514> use your Camo!
[4:10:30] <%Deft_Thought> That boy fast, damn
[4:10:37] <Rostichenburg> She got a Metroid Vaccine to save her life in Fusion
[4:10:40] <+ScatFace> she got Metroid DNA in super but that was revealed in fusion
[4:10:45] <CaptainBright> .......remember the Cloak, woolie
[4:10:52] <%Prevot> that girl is faaaaaast
[4:10:53] <$BioStormX> BioStormX subscribed with Prime. 
[4:10:57] <+ScatFace> or was it during the operation room in fusion?
[4:10:59] <AzureSynesthesia> i always find it funny that metroid copied the plot point of alien ressurection by making samus part metroid lol
[4:11:01] <+polothegreatest> samus is hylian-rito hybrid
[4:11:03] <%RyTYoung> just gotta keep movin'
[4:11:16] <+StatesmanPrimal> @ScatFace i think it was the operating room in fusion
[4:11:19] <%RealThiele> she got her baby DNA from after super in the beginning of fusion when she was dying to goop
[4:11:23] <Jrocy247> Remember to Cloak sometimes
[4:11:23] <%tank7013> @ScatFace The metroid dna was to save her from the x parasite
[4:11:25] <KnivesEve> woolie forgot about cloak?
[4:11:30] <+thelovingfool> WELCOME TO THE GAME!
[4:11:36] <+ScatFace> the baby saved her ass
[4:11:44] <+StatesmanPrimal> the baby is truly our savior
[4:11:45] <fairore> it was the vaccine
[4:12:07] <+scwry> METAL AS FUCK
[4:12:08] <%Deft_Thought> Nani
[4:12:10] <AzureSynesthesia> theres the kraid clone
[4:12:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:12:16] <Rostichenburg> The Baby save her life twice over and also that time Samus Returns
[4:12:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> I WANNA RESEARCH THAT
[4:12:18] <spawnzie> nothing to worry about I'm sure
[4:12:22] <%Deft_Thought> There's some wild shit goin on in this place
[4:12:23] <%DashXero> Is that crispy Kraid?
[4:12:23] <Asuterisuku> Metal album cover right there.
[4:12:29] <%RealThiele> spawn camper robot
[4:12:30] <Jrocy247> Twitchin
[4:12:36] <%DashXero> Nah. Couldn't be.
[4:12:37] <+dreamcastiszombie> Ridely?!
[4:12:43] <Rostichenburg> That's just a Lords of Shadow demon
[4:12:44] <%Deft_Thought> Looks like the invisible monster that you fought before but bigger
[4:12:48] <%DashXero> Kraid didn't have that many limbs.
[4:12:59] <UrsaDoom> it's a Metroid Queen
[4:13:01] <%Prevot> look at all these tubes, perfect to raise some metroids
[4:13:02] <+StatesmanPrimal> kraid is too fat to fit in there
[4:13:36] <Rostichenburg> Metroid Queens have longer snouts
[4:13:57] <Rostichenburg> And crocodile like mouths
[4:13:58] <%RealThiele> yea not a metroid queen under the scalpel
[4:14:02] <+polothegreatest> parasite queen?
[4:14:07] <+StatesmanPrimal> parasite eve?
[4:14:15] <KyberNasse> Maybe they brought Kraid's corpse into a similar room
[4:14:21] <%RyTYoung> Where all dem metroids hidin' wooliePOYO
[4:14:22] <Rostichenburg> Samus is basically Aya Brea
[4:14:24] <ScreamLord> Obviously it's Ridley
[4:14:36] <+StatesmanPrimal> they're working to make him into kraid shadow legends
[4:14:49] <NeroInfinite> The spicy robit
[4:14:56] <+StatesmanPrimal> that fast boi
[4:15:13] <+OniOniOniiii> twice the escape, makes sense o me
[4:15:18] <AstrodropGaming> NEVER combine your escape plans
[4:15:35] <%DashXero> @Rostichenburg Kinda.
[4:16:02] <+MisterAvry> missile thing there
[4:16:15] <%RyTYoung> @rostichenburg But before 3rd birthday Aya Brea gigaboOtsYES

[4:17:24] <%rindy0> YO
[4:17:28] <%rindy0> THE SCHMOVEMENT
[4:17:31] <Asuterisuku> Samus can't get into morph tunnels until the EMMI is gone.
[4:17:31] <%Prevot> always tough finding the hole when under pressure
[4:17:37] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you can grab those while camod ya know

[4:18:51] <Kaji04> Heart status: BEATING
[4:18:53] <redwidow1358> I thought for sure it was gonna crawl up the wall behind you man
[4:18:54] <Tempmael> dread one migth say
[4:19:03] <%RyTYoung> but it's a stealth mechanic, you drain less meter when you stop moving
[4:19:13] <%RyTYoung> and regain it quick when you move fast

[4:24:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> If castlevania starts in symphony of the night. Does Metroid starts at Hollow Knight? Kappa

[4:26:01] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bomb Em
[4:26:04] <hassanico2> Not that I'm complaining
[4:26:26] <jett_eyes> Bombs? You want them? They're yours my friend

[4:26:39] <vstpnv> that's also a slide melee
[4:26:43] <%rindy0> you can flash kick out of slide

[4:28:27] <%HollowedIdjit> ah fuck turn it back off
[4:28:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Science Bullshit
[4:28:35] <NeroInfinite> he's not dead just in agonizing pain
[4:28:44] <Asuterisuku> In fact it makes it worse because they're zapping it now.
[4:28:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolz might actually beat this in one go
[4:28:51] <KyberNasse> Frankensteining that monster
[4:29:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RealThiele we're just zapping this corpse to see what happens. so far, nothing, but who knows
[4:29:11] <%RealThiele> thanks science!
[4:29:12] <OBS_VinnieK> Gotta keep the rhythm up or Samus will drop
[4:29:16] <+scwry> @BallerSwagBro9k theres a lot lot more to this game

[4:29:43] <thunderborn32> you see so many clones of old enemies; what if youre also a samus clone
[4:29:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @scwry IK but hes powering thru it, hes almost halfway
[4:29:46] <Darren716> Woolie's about what, a third through?
[4:29:52] <Asuterisuku> This is two session pace though
[4:29:56] <+scwry> @BallerSwagBro9k he is not halfway
[4:30:03] <%RealThiele> hes maybe 30% in
[4:30:05] <+scwry> not even a quarter tbh
[4:30:09] <essence_of_lariatto> those guys are such little assholes

[4:32:49] <Darren716> All this is Chozo I believe, Fed just sent the emmis in
[4:32:52] <spawnzie> if only I could fast
[4:32:52] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Jrocy247 We got Chozo statues.

[4:33:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:33:38] <Qsmash_> I loved this area
[4:33:39] <kazadaz> Man that's a great minimap
[4:33:48] <+scwry> somehow a water area might be my favourite
[4:33:53] <+MisterAvry> the music in this game is really good
[4:34:07] <notgarza> !motivated
[4:34:07] <@Moobot> @notgarza 2316 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:34:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> She walks underwater like a hippo thats cool
[4:34:15] <Asuterisuku> Has Woolie noticed the naming scheme yet?
[4:34:16] <DoctorMulholland> For as much hate as water levels generally tend to get the underwater areas in Metroid have always been among my favorites in their respective games.
[4:34:24] <+RadioSpirit> !motivated
[4:34:25] <KyberNasse> Those sucking things also suck up bombs LUL
[4:34:26] <CryHavoc_12> The music is very Metroid Prime
[4:34:35] <%RealThiele> the only problem i have with the map is just make the whole room colored in when im there, dont have 3 different colors for explored, physically touched and unexplored
[4:34:52] <vstpnv> i'd say ambiance is good, especially in this area, but as a music it's kinda just there
[4:34:53] <+scwry> the backgronds are just gorgeous here
[4:35:02] <$SilverRoddo> Doureedo
[4:35:05] <%Afterman_> it is

[4:36:32] <hassanico2> oh this enemy is rude as hell, the baby spewer
[4:36:35] <tangowulf> Adam never calls you "Lady" anymore. It's suspicious
[4:36:40] <%HollowedIdjit> nature do be kinda fucked like that
[4:36:47] <+alphonseisbest> @HollowedIdjit he did at the start of the game
[4:37:11] <+D00msDayDan> @tangowulf oh my god, birdgil gave samus a dick
[4:37:12] <KingSpunf> This game is like Dark Souls: you can cheese enemies through walls
[4:37:33] <+DatAsuna> the dark souls of metroid
[4:37:34] <Asuterisuku> You can't open that yet.
[4:37:36] <%RealThiele> shits locked
[4:37:44] <tangowulf> @alphonseisbest That's what I mean. He's been calling her 'Samus' since she was knocked out
[4:37:53] <spawnzie> those had me real confused first time through
[4:38:02] <$SilverRoddo> Future Randomizer tech
[4:38:03] <Darren716> Come back later when you have the coolest power in this game
[4:38:09] <BlackermanZX> ya need a new item for that
[4:38:18] <+QuestJefferson> You need to be able to hit all 5 buttons before the lights reset
[4:38:21] <+scwry> they vanish too fast to do that
[4:38:23] <+MisterAvry> seems too quick
[4:38:25] <kikoeru_san> Woolie you need a thing
[4:38:33] <Louie_Salmon> You'd need to stop time to shoot that many missiles
[4:38:43] <%Prevot> I think Prime 3 had a powerup like that
[4:38:45] <Qsmash_> you need link's boomerang
[4:38:51] <+D00msDayDan> better come back when you get time stop
[4:39:02] <+a_goth_pancake> oh dang, he's already in bainura?
[4:39:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats one a them there thing doors
[4:39:03] <Asuterisuku> Prime 2 had it as well
[4:39:19] <$SilverRoddo> You need the Contra S power-up mikeliveLiono
[4:39:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> You need abyssal shriek to open that Kappa
[4:39:35] <%HollowedIdjit> Time Stop could do it. Or hear me out. a Really Big Missile.
[4:39:43] <spawnzie> you  need time stop
[4:39:44] <tangowulf> Why did Sakurai release the last Smash DLC *BEFORE* this game dropped. I want THIS Samus in Smash
[4:40:12] <CryHavoc_12> PogChamp
[4:40:29] <+TheIndigoLlama> man the subtle filter on the music when you go underwater is goated
[4:40:31] <Darren716> I mean smash Samus has always been grossly underpowered compared to what she can be
[4:40:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[4:40:39] <%RealThiele> fuckoff blocks
[4:40:53] <spawnzie> i could see it
[4:41:04] <hollumdusk> Link, Samus and Mario (And Ganondorf) are dire need of Moveset updates for future Smash games.
[4:41:09] <spawnzie> bomb jumps are easier in this one
[4:41:11] <+MisterAvry> can't you just ride the zipline from back there?
[4:41:33] <kinkade_77> samus should have shine spark as up b
[4:41:43] <DXLelouch24> fav new ability comin up
[4:41:53] <%HollowedIdjit> i think Mario's moveset is fine tbh
[4:41:55] <fairore> @kinkade_77 what no
[4:42:01] <%Prevot> fucking Mario still using the fluid is ridiculous
[4:42:05] <spawnzie> they do some cool shot with speed boost in this one
[4:42:08] <Asuterisuku> The game is extremely pretty for 900p though.
[4:42:13] <%Prevot> *fludd
[4:42:15] <thackattack00> Young Link should have a Majora's Mask themed moveset
[4:42:17] <+scwry> deeeeeep
[4:42:20] <%RealThiele> we fallll
[4:42:20] <+DatAsuna> @hollumdusk Remember how ganondorf got a sick twilight sword move in smash 4 then immediately lost it? And when customs let echo fighters actually have different moves?
[4:42:23] <+scwry> space whales

[4:43:39] <redwidow1358> Okay but imagine running from an EMMI underwater and it has the speed of the yellow one
[4:43:41] <%Prevot> I know right, seems like it would be very difficult
[4:43:44] <redwidow1358> That would be ridiculous
[4:43:51] <oneimportantthing> Yeah that would be bad huh

[4:46:56] <%HeroToxiko> it's not trick it's the teleport from zoe
[4:46:57] <%Artoo__The_Me> You mean Dark Samus?
[4:47:00] <spawnzie> samus with an air dash is all I've ever needed in my life and didn't know it until this game
[4:47:01] <fairore> she be would be so annoying bro
[4:47:04] <MmmokayByron> She's going to put Fox and Falco to shame
[4:47:04] <+DatAsuna> Functionally it's not something she doesn't have in smash, just a cooler animation on it
[4:47:07] <+Slattsquatch> Canon accurate Samus would be busted as fuck in Smash
[4:47:08] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Imagine "Deny Damage" as a skill
[4:47:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> i don't know, i play dark samus
[4:47:13] <%Dr00_PhD> Nah make it the counter and then have do a dash melee
[4:47:13] <%RealThiele> flash window
[4:47:16] <Blank9> it comes back sooooo fast

[4:47:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:47:32] <+DatAsuna> @Dr00_PhD yeah a down b counter
[4:47:33] <+StatesmanPrimal> canon accurate samus would just freeze beam everyone off the stage
[4:47:51] <Blank9> you can also just move and tap A
[4:47:51] <thackattack00> idk why it leads with the holding A thing you can just tap that shit way easier
[4:47:52] <%RealThiele> canon samus could also just power bobm and nuke pikachu
[4:47:57] <+scwry> triple dash on command
[4:47:58] <+MisterAvry> feels good?
[4:47:58] <BlackermanZX> you can do it instantly too right?

[4:48:37] <@Menitta> that effect is so good
[4:48:40] <spawnzie> PLEASE be implemented in prime
[4:48:42] <%RyuuAoi> SAMUS FOR TEKKEN?
[4:48:43] <redwidow1358> This makes evasion so much snappier
[4:48:44] <+scwry> this flows into combat realllly well
[4:48:45] <OfficerMods> no i frames though
[4:48:45] <+QuestJefferson> Can it come back in the air or do you have to hit the ground to recover Aeion?
[4:48:47] <notgarza> The mixup potential
[4:48:47] <OfficerMods> just real fast
[4:48:48] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Now Parry then Roman Cancel into Flash step
[4:48:49] <%RealThiele> Tied with pats progress now at least
[4:48:49] <%Deft_Thought> Sign my petition to give Samus a Genei-Jin
[4:48:53] <%a_goth_pancake> a_goth_pancake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Glad to see you enjoying Dread, Woolie! It's nice to see Samus finally getting some dope new moves like cloak and Flash Shift. Still, wish they would give her the Super wall jump back. Oh well.
[4:48:56] <+MisterAvry> that's a good powerup
[4:48:59] <+StatesmanPrimal> this is the new kbd
[4:49:00] <+thelovingfool> its NOT invincivle
[4:49:01] <spawnzie> nah
[4:49:02] <Aydarkzero> check it
[4:49:03] <AncelDeLambert> no
[4:49:03] <%Sparkseid> no
[4:49:04] <+scwry> no sadly
[4:49:04] <DXLelouch24> no
[4:49:04] <+StatesmanPrimal> no
[4:49:04] <Saltmeisterr> NO
[4:49:04] <+Slattsquatch> No iframes
[4:49:05] <+vaderxyz1970> It only gets better from hear
[4:49:05] <+Spiritofpower> No i-frames as far as I can tell
[4:49:06] <%RealThiele> nein
[4:49:06] <Qsmash_> no i-frames
[4:49:06] <OfficerMods> no i frames
[4:49:06] <%RyTYoung> No
[4:49:07] <Treasure_Vault> ADAM with the fakout "lol i dunno grav suit or something next gl"
[4:49:08] <FrostedZaibatsu> in-game buffs as you play
[4:49:08] <AncelDeLambert> you'll eat shit if you try
[4:49:10] <grimwire1> if that move was in smash things would be broken
[4:49:10] <+teddybomber> nah you cant go through enemies
[4:49:12] <+Alvarado94> No I frames
[4:49:12] <Qsmash_> that would be too buff
[4:49:12] <Jrocy247> No Woolie, that would make it TOO Op
[4:49:12] <hollumdusk> Don't worry, the game will humble you out very quickly!
[4:49:12] <+crudequip> no iframes
[4:49:13] <Blank9> just move fast
[4:49:14] <Asuterisuku> Unfortunately, it does NOT have i-frames.
[4:49:14] <+rbakervv> no i-frames
[4:49:15] <BKNPham> ngl i like this color scheme way more than the default
[4:49:16] <redwidow1358> It is not invincible
[4:49:17] <spawnzie> It's not free
[4:49:21] <%mitchteck> No
[4:49:23] <BlackermanZX> its pretty much a MMX dash
[4:49:28] <redwidow1358> You need a clear path forward or back
[4:49:28] <%HollowedIdjit> @questjefferson you can recover it in the air. This is important later.
[4:49:28] <VictorBelmontVT> yeah it's a dodge, not a teleport
[4:49:31] <spawnzie> but you CAN short hop dash over em
[4:49:33] <DXLelouch24> you jump and dash away. remember this youll need it
[4:49:39] <DXLelouch24> youll be using this ALOT
[4:49:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> the cost of schmovin
[4:49:42] <+jack_arbor> Is this worth pulling my switch out of the closet?
[4:49:43] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Speedrunners seething

[4:49:59] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:50:01] <Asuterisuku> Oh that's what you think.
[4:50:01] <Qsmash_> Shinespark and Woolie are no longer friends?
[4:50:04] <Blank9> flash shift is the mistress
[4:50:04] <DXLelouch24> @jack_arbor ABSOLUTELY
[4:50:05] <%Deft_Thought> The betrayal NotLikeThis
[4:50:07] <thunderborn32> @RealThiele well you can progress much faster when you dont have a panic attack everytime you cant pick up a missile upgrade
[4:50:10] <Treasure_Vault> Shinespark is also seeing flash shift, it's cool
[4:50:10] <spawnzie> I'm not leaving you, I just need to try some new things
[4:50:11] <Saltmeisterr> wait till u see woolie
[4:50:11] <+scwry> Shinespark will be back with a new haircut too dw
[4:50:12] <%Sparkseid> ntr
[4:50:13] <CryHavoc_12> Flash shift-chan
[4:50:14] <+vaderxyz1970> What flashstep reached for the check!?
[4:50:15] <kinkade_77> just wait.
[4:50:16] <+StatesmanPrimal> the new shinespark is pretty hype
[4:50:18] <Blank9> shinespark's only on the weekends
[4:50:23] <BlackermanZX> Speedbost got ntr'd damn
[4:50:23] <DXLelouch24> oh woolie you havent begun to see whats to come
[4:50:26] <DoctorMulholland> They've come a long way haven't they
[4:50:26] <%RyTYoung> woolieYE
[4:50:29] <%CAPSLOCKlive> I'm not ditching you Shine Spark, i'm just into some new kinky shit
[4:50:35] <+shootbang_exe> yes
[4:50:36] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[4:50:36] <DXLelouch24> Shinespark got a glowup
[4:50:37] <+DatAsuna> It was trash
[4:50:38] <Jrocy247> Yes
[4:50:38] <%Sparkseid> yes
[4:50:39] <DXLelouch24> yes
[4:50:39] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[4:50:40] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> they have come a long way from mirror of fate
[4:50:40] <+StatesmanPrimal> yeah
[4:50:40] <%DashXero> LOS1 was pretty cool.
[4:50:41] <NeroInfinite> yes
[4:50:41] <%RealThiele> yes
[4:50:41] <StarMechV> Nintendo really knows how to bring the best in these companies
[4:50:42] <+shootbang_exe> it killed castlevania
[4:50:42] <Qsmash_> ehhhh
[4:50:42] <+Dudealy> It doesn't have to be like that Woolie, you got two hands. you can love flash shift and shinespark
[4:50:43] <DXLelouch24> they learned
[4:50:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> Which Castlevania game?
[4:50:44] <@Menitta> It was VERY bad
[4:50:45] <%RyTYoung> I mean ...
[4:50:47] <Asuterisuku> It was aight
[4:50:47] <+DatAsuna> Nintendo is probably stricter than Konami
[4:50:48] <%RyTYoung> it was ok
[4:50:49] <%RealThiele> they have had  ALOT of time to iterate
[4:50:51] <BlackermanZX> they learned
[4:50:52] <+PA_august> there's was a few
[4:50:52] <+alphonseisbest> IDK
[4:50:52] <UrsaDoom> Lords of Shadow was alright
[4:50:52] <@Menitta> Nintendo reigned them in
[4:50:55] <hollumdusk> It wasn't that bad.
[4:50:55] <vstpnv> mediocre
[4:50:56] <%RealThiele> thankfully they are learning
[4:50:56] <OfficerMods> japanese producers cracking the whip
[4:50:56] <+Spiritofpower> MS just got way better
[4:50:57] <+MegaQuint> They were just in the wrong half of the Metroidvania formula
[4:50:57] <Blank9> LoS1 is good, I stand by that compared to any 3D castlevania
[4:50:58] <+scwry> theres some LOVE in this game
[4:50:58] <%Prevot> they need the Nintendo whip crackin at their back
[4:50:59] <Savatewolf> Nintendo coming in with the "I can fix them"
[4:51:00] <DXLelouch24> they realized their full potential via Nintendo
[4:51:00] <%a_goth_pancake> it was mercury steam, no?
[4:51:01] <alroy900> this is good
[4:51:03] <+DatAsuna> What happened was Konami had low standards for them
[4:51:03] <+QuestJefferson> @Sonny_Firestorm I think this is the same studio that did the Lords of Shadow games
[4:51:05] <kentrix11> Maybe Konami fucked them over.
[4:51:05] <+MegaQuint> They needed the Metroid and not the Vania
[4:51:06] <+polothegreatest> shiggy fury
[4:51:06] <Darren716> Konami didn't give a fuck, Nintendo does
[4:51:08] <KyberNasse> Sorry Shinespark, but Flash Shift is ready anytime
[4:51:08] <double_zr_tap> maybe hey learned a lot
[4:51:09] <+Jayleedurr> What happened?
[4:51:10] <%RyuuAoi> Castlevania 64 alright BabyRage
[4:51:10] <+alphonseisbest> LOS1 is still TRASH
[4:51:11] <@Menitta> Wouldnt be the first time. Next Level Games wasnt too great before Strikers
[4:51:13] <%DashXero> The only problem I had with Lords of Shadow was that it was too long.
[4:51:15] <%RyTYoung> they've improved the formula that they had with castlevania
[4:51:16] <DoctorMulholland> I mean Retro was evidently a shitshow too before Nintendo got them on track with Prime.
[4:51:16] <+StatesmanPrimal> nintendo is an actual game company sometimes unlike konami
[4:51:18] <+Slattsquatch> Retro Studios was also kinda in shambles before they were given Metroid Prime
[4:51:22] <%RealThiele> Miyamoto will kill your children
[4:51:23] <kinkade_77> samus returns wasnt that bad imo
[4:51:23] <OfficerMods> either make the best metroid game ever or we don't ship it
[4:51:25] <MmmokayByron> "Don't fuck this up" - Nintendo, probably
[4:51:34] <%Prevot> konami gives no fucks, Nintendo gives ALL the fucks
[4:51:37] <Kaji04> Oh, I 100%ed this game without realizing you can link the flash dash 3 times amazing
[4:51:37] <%HollowedIdjit> "If this isn't perfect, there will be blood."
[4:51:38] <+Shoosler> Nintendo does what Konami can't
[4:51:40] <Deadpool2450> nah konami is just that bad of a company they ruiin devs too. Double Helix, MercurySteam, etc..
[4:51:40] <hollumdusk> Remember Silicon Knights with Nintendo, compared to them without Nintendo?
[4:51:41] <spawnzie> same thing that happened with prime I guess
[4:51:42] <Jaller101514> its a turn around like Ninja theory
[4:51:44] <+scwry> Retro studios was crunching pretty bad before nintendo sorted it out
[4:51:51] <DXLelouch24> "This better be the best 2D Metroid since Super or your fired"-Nintendo Probably
[4:51:52] <UrsaDoom> Mercury Steam wanted to make a more traditional Castlevania game, but Konami wanted something different for the future of the franchise.
[4:51:54] <DXLelouch24> and it is
[4:51:58] <DXLelouch24> hell its better than Super
[4:51:59] <+DatAsuna> @Jaller101514 Yeah capcom on their backs made a big improvement
[4:51:59] <DedlokPM> Also the "nintendo giving a shit factor"
[4:52:00] <DXLelouch24> FIGHT ME
[4:52:06] <%RyuuAoi> Good thing they started over!
[4:52:06] <+scwry> this may be the best metroid game
[4:52:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> water physics in MY metroid??
[4:52:20] <%Artoo__The_Me> I already know what‚Äôs gonna be woolie‚Äôs favorite next ability
[4:52:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> i might like this one even more than fusion
[4:52:24] <%a_goth_pancake> Hope this game does well enough for more. I don't mind MS behind the wheel, this and Samus Returns are awesome.
[4:52:24] <kinkade_77> didnt mercury want to make a fusion remake?
[4:52:25] <%RealThiele> Fusion is still better but ima  beam purist
[4:52:37] <KyberNasse> Man, imagine a good 2D Castlevania. Modernized childhood renaissance
[4:52:39] <@Menitta> I like this more than Fusion so far
[4:52:42] <+scwry> this has so much fusion dna though
[4:52:43] <BurdRightsActivist> d12 missles pog
[4:52:56] <+StatesmanPrimal> i mean this is kind of fusion 2.0
[4:52:57] <Asuterisuku> "Ice."
[4:52:58] <Blank9> @kinkade_77 that was their pitch to nintendo, and then they told them to remake metroid 2 instead
[4:52:58] <%RyuuAoi> I want Fusion Prime Remake.
[4:52:59] <%Prevot> this game is totally Fusion 2
[4:53:00] <OfficerMods> fusion is just so linear it doesn't get real good until like the last hour
[4:53:02] <BurdRightsActivist> "ice"
[4:53:02] <+Slattsquatch> They pitched a Fusion remake to Nintendo but instead they were given a brand new game to work on
[4:53:06] <OfficerMods> linear and formulaic
[4:53:08] <+Spiritofpower> Infinite bomb jump would probably also work if you can do that underwater
[4:53:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> ZM is still my favorite but this will probably top it once I get my hands on it
[4:53:16] <+DaRyeBeachHood> I'd love to see them remake Fusion in this engine, but make the zones more connected and less linear
[4:53:22] <hollumdusk> @Slattsquatch Well, technically they were given a Remake of 2 instead
[4:53:23] <%RealThiele> infinite bombjump doesnt work under water from what i tried
[4:53:27] <+scwry> fusion doesnt have nice sequence breaking like INJ
[4:53:28] <OfficerMods> go hear talk to adam fix that absorb an x repeat over and over
[4:53:32] <%RyuuAoi> @prevot Absolutely
[4:53:38] <%Prevot> I'd say this is the Super Metroid to Fusion's Metroid 1
[4:53:39] <Saltmeisterr> woolie blind
[4:53:43] <Darren716> I mean that was the right way
[4:53:47] <+Slattsquatch> @Slattsquatch I thought the Fusion pitch was after they made Samus Returns, maybe I'm getting my wires crossed
[4:53:52] <+extradopeness> i mean fusion was 4 and this is 5 so it kinda literally is Fusion 2
[4:53:53] <HibiscusMist> I feel like I've seen those enemies in mario before
[4:53:59] <HibiscusMist> Only they shot water bullets
[4:54:05] <+MisterAvry> is it for blue blocks?
[4:54:07] <%RyTYoung> nope
[4:54:29] <+crudequip> :tf:
[4:54:51] <%KetsuoTaberu> wind too stronk
[4:54:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[4:54:55] <@Menitta> this area reminds me of the metroid section in subspace
[4:54:55] <Darren716> Seems your side ho cant do everything
[4:54:57] <DXLelouch24> Airman levels of blowing
[4:54:58] <+StatesmanPrimal> nah you need MORE speed
[4:54:58] <hollumdusk> @Slattsquatch They pitched a Fusion Remake first, but Sakamoto thought a Remake of 2 was a better idea. And together included the teases for Dread in it
[4:55:04] <@Menitta> all the tech metal
[4:55:05] <NeroInfinite> you ain't getting that E tank with that wind
[4:55:07] <essence_of_lariatto> real dickish of the archtech to put that fan there
[4:55:08] <AngryAsian5> GALEFORCE
[4:55:13] <BlackermanZX> the wind is pushing meee
[4:55:24] <%RealThiele> Gods breath turbine
[4:55:29] <kinkade_77> wind would rip your skin off
[4:55:30] <+StatesmanPrimal> POG
[4:55:31] <+PA_august> that's Chozo fan it's very powerfull becuase they are very wise alien
[4:55:31] <%KetsuoTaberu> looks like you could crawl and get it, but Metroid can't crawl NotLikeThis
[4:55:37] <CryHavoc_12> Flash Shift-chan is not a replacement of Shinespark-san :^]
[4:55:38] <%RyuuAoi> He's gotta test it Kreygasm
[4:55:44] <pi_in_the_sci> red thing to choot
[4:55:46] <redwidow1358> Unfortunately Metroid cannot crawl
[4:55:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> look the summer here is awful you need industrial fans
[4:55:58] <Darren716> Is he just ignoring the wall blast?
[4:55:59] <AlphaRayAllen> Love the music in this zone
[4:56:04] <Saltmeisterr> woolie blind
[4:56:10] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus its a Chozo fan, thats why its so powerful
[4:56:10] <thunderborn32> oh so samus is on florida?
[4:56:11] <Darren716> Big blind
[4:56:12] <VictorBelmontVT> yeah he didn't see it
[4:56:23] <DXLelouch24> they made their fans built to last
[4:56:24] <%RealThiele> woolie will figure it out
[4:56:42] <+StatesmanPrimal> nah ZDR is Neo New Mexico
[4:56:51] <kinkade_77> metroid life bar is best life bar
[4:56:59] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will indeed figure it out
[4:57:06] <%RyTYoung> if you say so...
[4:57:07] <Darren716> I mean you literally had it LUL
[4:57:12] <VictorBelmontVT> Eventually‚Ñ¢
[4:57:17] <+scwry> may be a while if were going down here
[4:57:26] <AlphaRayAllen> I was super lost at some point
[4:57:44] <+scwry> worth coming back just for that
[4:57:49] <@Menitta> I got lost between Dairon and Cataris
[4:57:50] <+StatesmanPrimal> i got lost alot
[4:57:57] <fairore> me to
[4:57:57] <Calek> I thought I got stuck twice
[4:58:00] <@Menitta> because I thought I shot the floor
[4:58:00] <roughday25> 10 missiles is always good
[4:58:02] <%RyTYoung> I got lost alot also
[4:58:29] <thunderborn32> fish actually minding their own business, but they unfortunately got in her way
[4:58:30] <+scwry> this game does a very good job funneling you to the next area without it feeling restricting
[4:58:40] <AlphaRayAllen> Actually this is the exact part i got lost on
[4:58:40] <VictorBelmontVT> I got stuck once, only because a power said part of it didn't work underwater, so I thought it didn't work at all, but it like half worked
[4:58:55] <Darren716> VictorBelmontVT Spin?
[4:58:57] <+StatesmanPrimal> you mean space jump right?
[4:59:02] <VictorBelmontVT> yeah space jump/spin
[4:59:06] <redwidow1358> I got stuck on that section because the timing was confusing underwater
[4:59:06] <%RealThiele> ABFS
[4:59:11] <Darren716> Because yeah that text is super confusing
[4:59:14] <+StatesmanPrimal> it is
[4:59:23] <+scwry> I havent got stuck yet oddly, i just got gravity suit
[4:59:32] <+StatesmanPrimal> i just tried it underwater and i noticed i kept the height so i figured it out
[4:59:35] <redwidow1358> The text made sense, I was just doing it too early because I thought the timing had to be tighter
[4:59:45] <redwidow1358> It was very odd lol
[4:59:51] <+StatesmanPrimal> man i remember this one missile tank that was real ass to get
[4:59:56] <Asuterisuku> Weren't there doors in the last area you couldn't get through before?
[4:59:58] <Darren716> Woolie you literally were there when you moved the water
[5:00:02] <+scwry> but when you get space jump, it teaches you about using it underwater?
[5:00:12] <Darren716> You just missed a wall bit
[5:00:23] <+StatesmanPrimal> you had to speed boost through like four different wall jumps and across two rooms
[5:00:24] <+scwry> otherwise you cant get out, you have to cross a water pit with space jump
[5:00:34] <VictorBelmontVT> @Darren716 I definitely think old Metroids are making him think he has to back track more than he needs to in this game lol
[5:00:44] <Darren716> @StatesmanPrimal The ramp one?
[5:00:56] <+StatesmanPrimal> @StatesmanPrimal i think
[5:01:12] <Darren716> I think I spent half an hour doing the ramp last night
[5:01:17] <+scwry> remember the last thing you did before you got lost was drain the water in the west side
[5:01:27] <+StatesmanPrimal> it was like, through an emmi zone then you walljump, and then slide into the next room and do three more wall jumps
[5:01:28] <%RealThiele> wave of babies
[5:01:30] <%RyTYoung> after about 10 hours in I have finally got a very iconic ability NotLikeThis
[5:01:33] <+scwry> east side*
[5:01:37] <+MisterAvry> you ever make someone so mad they reproduce at you?
[5:01:44] <AlphaRayAllen> These things are so obnoxious
[5:01:44] <VictorBelmontVT> lolol
[5:01:45] <Asuterisuku> Tip for dealing with swarms: Missiles actually do some splash damage this ti9me.
[5:02:11] <DaCheekyOne> Yo damn. Woolie looks mad with that red behind him
[5:02:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:02:19] <%RealThiele> bye adam
[5:02:24] <Asuterisuku> If ADAM has something to say, he'll lock the doors.
[5:02:33] <%KiwamiKiryu> !uptime
[5:02:33] <@Moobot> @KiwamiKiryu WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 13 minutes
[5:02:40] <Blank9> I still don't get what people are talking about with this game being 6 hours long
[5:02:58] <%invisi_bliss> invisi_bliss subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! The baby
[5:02:58] <+scwry> you drained the water on the west side
[5:02:59] <Darren716> I'll just say, it's in this zone
[5:03:01] <Darren716> Nah
[5:03:01] <%RealThiele> it "can" be 6 hours long, but if you take your time 12-16 seems casual
[5:03:05] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's about 9-12 on average at the high and low end
[5:03:10] <Darren716> Hmmmmmmmmmmm
[5:03:11] <Saltmeisterr> he did a big blind
[5:03:11] <pi_in_the_sci> You missed something in the room you drained the water from
[5:03:14] <Savatewolf> they're talking about the time they get at the end of the game
[5:03:14] <%ennui_on_me> It's 6 hours if you're really good at it and don't look for anything
[5:03:16] <KyberNasse> People blaze through and dont collect upgrades
[5:03:16] <VictorBelmontVT> I beat it in 8 hours, so I could see 6
[5:03:18] <mothdude> The in-game time isn't the same as actual time I think.
[5:03:18] <redwidow1358> The in-game timer doesn't account for things like menus, and retries, so the end result is off compared to your real play time
[5:03:18] <+StatesmanPrimal> 10 usually
[5:03:27] <kinkade_77> metroid games are always on the shorter end
[5:03:41] <Darren716> My time said 10 and that was with me backtracking through everything at the very end
[5:03:46] <+StatesmanPrimal> unlike super which is like a bajillion years long
[5:03:47] <DaCheekyOne> People said RE:8 was 7 hours long. It wasn't
[5:04:30] <%Afterman_> you might be able to if you chain them together
[5:04:36] <AlphaRayAllen> LUL
[5:04:38] <%Afterman_> Or that
[5:04:49] <+DatAsuna> @DaCheekyOne People said MGR was 3 hours long because they only counted the battle timers on your save
[5:05:04] <Darren716> I mean MGR is super short
[5:05:12] <+DatAsuna> but it's not fucking 3 hours short
[5:05:23] <DoctorMulholland> My play counter for Dread said about 9 hours but that doesn't count all the deaths and reloads, which for certain bosses and EMMIs were numerous. Probably closer to 11 or 12 hours realtime.
[5:05:45] <+DatAsuna> Your switch playytime will be more accurate than your save in that way, yes
[5:05:47] <+scwry> its a good length, and theres lots of replayability
[5:05:56] <VictorBelmontVT> Last boss definitely took me like an entire hour of practice that didn't count against my play time
[5:06:04] <fairore> @DoctorMulholland mines was 10hrs
[5:06:06] <+extradopeness> yeah that end game timer doesnt account for pause menu time and time spent on reloads.
[5:06:17] <Darren716> Hes so close
[5:06:40] <+DatAsuna> Using your save file to actually judge your playtime now is silly, unless you did a perfect run with no reloads, and it's not a game that only counts certain sequences in the timer
[5:06:42] <+extradopeness> well idk about the pause menu for certain but thays how it was for fusion
[5:06:43] <pi_in_the_sci> by where you can see a bit of room on the map
[5:06:59] <%RyTYoung> I'm enjoying just back tracking and collecting items that I couldn't get before
[5:07:02] <+scwry> youre in the right area
[5:07:04] <+DatAsuna> just check your console/steam profile .etc for the real hour count
[5:07:25] <kinkade_77> hollow knight is way too long imo
[5:07:30] <VictorBelmontVT> HE FOUND IT
[5:07:32] <+scwry> got it
[5:07:34] <Darren716> YAY
[5:07:36] <+Xeogred> I overlooked this crap for like an hour lol
[5:07:41] <%RyuuAoi> Best underwater theme
[5:07:54] <+extradopeness> come on ride the train
[5:08:23] <%a_goth_pancake> I love these tram rooms, the environmental detail in bainura especially is just so gorgeous.
[5:08:26] <%RyuuAoi> woolieMIRIN
[5:08:32] <@Menitta> It feels weird playing a game while watching a stream of same game and the stream is slightly ahead
[5:08:43] <%Deft_Thought> Man, fully powered Samus is fucking terrifying. She's running with enough speed and force to destroy solid objects, can shoot laser cannons through walls, and set off massive explosions in a ball-form. She fuckin crazy.
[5:08:45] <BlackermanZX> Zero shift from ZOE
[5:08:50] <pi_in_the_sci> that sounds right
[5:09:04] <OfficerMods> i think it has more to do with castlevania
[5:09:11] <+shieldanvil> wow i can't believe they included samus's bomb dash from super smash bros
[5:09:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:09:12] <jorniev> oh shit the dread
[5:09:14] <%RyuuAoi> Just wait...
[5:09:15] <+extradopeness> that flash shift is the m9ve that really makes the pro gameplay happen
[5:09:19] <fairore> that sounds like a reach to me
[5:09:20] <prime_name> hmmmm
[5:09:32] <%Deft_Thought> Couldn't Dark Samus shift like that?
[5:09:47] <+Xeogred> there's something so mysterious about those tram rooms to me. Maybe the lonely vibes on such a huge foreign world
[5:09:52] <DXLelouch24> @Deft_Thought as long as your not a planet, a dragon,a space pirate, or an alien shes prob chill
[5:09:57] <+extradopeness> SA-X > Dark Samus
[5:09:59] <VictorBelmontVT> Was anyone else mildly disappointed how fast you get the Varia suit in this game? I would of liked more time with the blue trim suit
[5:10:05] <bear_breaker20> *tune in to see how woolie's liking new gaem, immediately notice the smile and optimism has been restored*
[5:10:15] <@Menitta> god if you could flash shift in any direction
[5:10:16] <redwidow1358> I was just happy to actually get the Varia to make things easier tbh
[5:10:18] <%RyuuAoi> DREAD
[5:10:21] <%Deft_Thought> @DXLelouch24 Yo but we live on a planet monkaS
[5:10:26] <+monfo_the_great> Those two timings are tight
[5:10:31] <DXLelouch24> so about dealing with it in the water huh woolie
[5:10:32] <dreamfillah> yeah it throws you off
[5:10:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> You'll never have them on lock
[5:10:41] <mattymcfilth> hey guys is he trying to pary on the second flash too?
[5:10:51] <+shootbang_exe> I'm not sure if I'm crazy but I feel like the window for consecutive parries gets smaller after you succeed
[5:10:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fear the killbots
[5:10:54] <%a_goth_pancake> you know, I don't really *dread* these things... they're mostly just annoying.
[5:10:56] <SethYuikora> It's good that they're hard too.  rather than press button to not die, okay, now you're good for a few minutes
[5:10:58] <TigerClaws12> can't really practice when startups are random for a 3f window LUL
[5:11:15] <OfficerMods> i hate to say it but i think the actual inspiration for flash shift was hollow knight
[5:11:29] <+StatesmanPrimal> i mean air dashes aren
[5:11:31] <@Menitta> I do kinda wish it was more consistent
[5:11:33] <+StatesmanPrimal> aren't new
[5:11:35] <SethYuikora> BRAINBOSS
[5:11:36] <dreamfillah> very well might be, or Symphony of the Night @officermods
[5:11:37] <fairore> you just gotta know in your heart
[5:11:42] <+StatesmanPrimal> the BRAIN
[5:11:43] <%Deft_Thought> This zone feels built so you can move around all slick
[5:11:45] <%Deft_Thought> It's great
[5:11:50] <+MisterAvry> "I'm a gigantic brain!"
[5:11:51] <+Clyderso> new dodge is sick
[5:11:53] <kinkade_77> dmc dash strong
[5:11:56] <+extradopeness> its designed to be actually super lucky to parry the EMMIs
[5:11:57] <%rindy0> the momentum on the missiles is so weird
[5:12:00] <KyberNasse> Yeyeyeye
[5:12:02] <+StatesmanPrimal> my brain is huuuuge
[5:12:09] <Parapattern> Shooting you with spaghetti-o's
[5:12:14] <OfficerMods> wait you can drift the missles
[5:12:17] <OfficerMods> thats wild
[5:12:22] <%ennui_on_me> yeah I had no idea
[5:12:22] <+StatesmanPrimal> LUL
[5:12:22] <ElPlasa> does the dodge has iframes?
[5:12:23] <SethYuikora> Omegabuster online
[5:12:24] <dreamfillah> @0rond it's got the same feel as the Side B she has in Smash
[5:12:25] <kinkade_77> revenge time
[5:12:27] <Nosphomet> she just ornsteined that brain
[5:12:29] <+PA_august> Sorry I murdered you brain
[5:12:31] <AncelDeLambert> REAL SHIT
[5:12:31] <%RyuuAoi> SICK
[5:12:32] <Asuterisuku> Auntie Brain Down.
[5:12:41] <thackattack00> no iframes @ElPlasa
[5:12:42] <AncelDeLambert> kaBOOM
[5:12:49] <chloenuva> @ElPlasa Nope, if you doge into something you get hit
[5:12:50] <%Deft_Thought> @Asuterisuku Auntie Brain LUL
[5:12:50] <%Prevot> now good luck killing this fast girl
[5:12:53] <%RyuuAoi> NO fucks given
[5:12:56] <AncelDeLambert> gawd, Woolie, don't waste it
[5:13:09] <+scwry> missed LUL
[5:13:10] <valriot> LUL

[5:13:12] <AncelDeLambert> uh oh, become error
[5:13:12] <ElPlasa> @ElPlasa ohhh so it's not as horribly overpowered as I thought it was
[5:13:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> he FAST
[5:13:13] <dreamfillah> SPEED
[5:13:13] <TigerClaws12> he schmoovin
[5:13:14] <%BisoromiBear> you thought
[5:13:14] <spawnzie> FAST
[5:13:15] <redwidow1358> YUP YUP YUP
[5:13:15] <AngryAsian5> HE'S A FAST BOI
[5:13:15] <Parapattern> SHe was COMING
[5:13:18] <+MisterAvry> oh LAWD
[5:13:18] <VictorBelmontVT> man I hated this one lolol
[5:13:19] <Asuterisuku> @Asuterisuku Because it's not mother Brain, but it's clearly related~
[5:13:19] <jorniev> death comes FAST
[5:13:21] <pi_in_the_sci> might want to get in the water
[5:13:21] <AngryAsian5> SPEEDY BOI
[5:13:22] <+nanaki_ff14> Just made it wow he is far
[5:13:23] <redwidow1358> FAST
[5:13:24] <mothdude> I like how even after you get the Omega Blaster the EMMI aren't free
[5:13:29] <+StatesmanPrimal> you gotta ready the stream real fast on him
[5:13:30] <kinkade_77> emmi deaths are gruesome
[5:13:30] <dreamfillah> gotta aim down
[5:13:34] <%RyuuAoi> I don't see nothing wrong...
[5:14:00] <@Menitta> this looks hard
[5:14:10] <Asuterisuku> This IS hard.
[5:14:14] <Jrocy247> This is a bit difficult
[5:14:16] <redwidow1358> This is very fucking hard lol
[5:14:24] <%Deft_Thought> FUCK
[5:14:28] <Blank9> I did it around here too
[5:14:28] <essence_of_lariatto> this was easily the hardest one to kill for me
[5:14:29] <+scwry> he just needs to aim it before
[5:14:29] <%Deft_Thought> This tricky little shit
[5:14:33] <redwidow1358> You basically get one shot before you have to give up and loop around
[5:14:38] <VictorBelmontVT> This game is so much fun if you're looking for a challenge
[5:14:49] <+StatesmanPrimal> yeah this one is pretty hard
[5:14:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> This one really requires the micro aim adjustments
[5:14:58] <redwidow1358> I cannot wait to replay this game on hard mode
[5:15:00] <+D00msDayDan> i came back at just the right time
[5:15:05] <ElPlasa> you miss 3-4 shots and that loop is GONE
[5:15:10] <%RyuuAoi> Put your shield die
[5:15:13] <%RyuuAoi> Down
[5:15:16] <VictorBelmontVT> o o f
[5:15:20] <+Rolandknight> he know he could have use that step down so he didn't need to aim right?
[5:15:21] <+MisterAvry> almost
[5:15:23] <Jrocy247> You essentially have to hit it perfectly to not let it speed up
[5:15:25] <naph_runs> daaamn
[5:15:27] <%a_goth_pancake> this one gave me way too much trouble. I found the most success from luring it to one side of the first drop and then flash stepping to the other side to focus him down.
[5:15:29] <+scwry> could use dash to get ahead ofit
[5:15:30] <essence_of_lariatto> miss one shot you dead
[5:15:33] <dreamfillah> can you crouch?
[5:15:43] <redwidow1358> Can't crouch while doing the pose
[5:15:49] <AncelDeLambert> you need WAY more space than this, Woolie
[5:15:52] <ElPlasa> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:15:52] <+nanaki_ff14> FRAME PERFECT
[5:15:54] <+MisterAvry> ayy
[5:15:55] <AngryAsian5> NICE
[5:15:57] <dreamfillah> gotta aim lower when it gets close
[5:16:02] <%a_goth_pancake> yeyeyeyyee right here.
[5:16:07] <%RyuuAoi> You wanna parry?
[5:16:08] <+MisterAvry> that's it
[5:16:10] <+FuqBoiSlim> he got it now

[5:17:16] <+StatesmanPrimal> i wish samus had the shinespark as her final smash
[5:17:16] <kinkade_77> i just noticed the ankle guards move when crouched so cool
[5:17:18] <powerprotoman> this speed booster is even more cool
[5:17:19] <scoot_io> getter robo is pretty cool huh
[5:17:20] <%ennui_on_me> @nanaki_ff14 his first parry was first try
[5:17:24] <OfficerMods> more than judgement cut?
[5:17:28] <Darren716> QTEs that are based on normal moves are rad
[5:17:29] <Sonny_Firestorm> Vergil in general.
[5:17:34] <HelluvaNohbody> Shine... SAAaarKk!!!
[5:17:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Guys hes played other Metroid games

[5:17:47] <BlackermanZX> ANY direction
[5:17:51] <Darren716> Is this the first time shinespark is mentioned in canon?
[5:17:54] <Darren716> Like in game?

[5:18:13] <+scwry> that flash shift though...
[5:18:14] <+Slattsquatch> @Darren716 It was mentioned by name in Fusion
[5:18:15] <+twohitgood> i really dislike using L3 for anything.
[5:18:16] <HelluvaNohbody> We Getter Robo now
[5:18:18] <%jinking79> game doesn't tell u can Shinespark in morphball form
[5:18:18] <Blank9> there's so many ways to use this, it rules
[5:18:20] <spawnzie> how many puppies would you kill for it?
[5:18:21] <fairore> woooo
[5:18:23] <$Holycow8498> The speed dash?
[5:18:24] <%Sparkseid> EZ
[5:18:24] <@Menitta> I like the grapple tho
[5:18:26] <+shootbang_exe> hey woolie wanna know some speed booster tech the game never tells you?
[5:18:27] <+alphonseisbest> the Zero shift?
[5:18:33] <powerprotoman> so if you slide or wall jump the booster will remain active its dope as shit
[5:18:36] <ElPlasa> HHHHNGGGG
[5:18:37] <+ninebreaker6> VECTOR CANNON
[5:18:37] <$Holycow8498> So what if they gave Vergil a speed dash like this?
[5:18:39] <SethYuikora> got little rocket boosters on her back n everything :D
[5:18:40] <DXLelouch24> so what your saying is Vergil should have a shinespark in DMC6?
[5:18:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYYE
[5:18:40] <+scwry> also, you can jump and slide and keep the speed boost
[5:18:42] <BlackermanZX> Damn flash shift got bitched
[5:18:43] <+thelovingfool> doesnt drain health anymore
[5:18:44] <+HakureiIllusion> Someone change Woolie's pants
[5:18:45] <Asuterisuku> Just jumping doesn't kill Speed Booster anymore!
[5:18:45] <+DatAsuna> It's almost like all those moves in DMC are ripped off from anime and toku shows anyway
[5:18:45] <%KetsuoTaberu> woolieGASM
[5:18:46] <Blank9> there's a million small adjustments and ways to manipulate it
[5:18:47] <DoctorMulholland> You just ran right past an E-tank part Woolie
[5:18:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> the shinespark charge last REAL long in this game
[5:18:50] <%RyuuAoi> ITS SO STRONG NOW
[5:18:55] <KyberNasse> FLASH WHO NOW?
[5:18:56] <+JGardner03> I really liked how this game added little Speedboost puzzles for some items lol
[5:18:57] <+scwry> you can even wall jump with speed boost
[5:19:00] <Parapattern> How many times would Woolie betray humanity for a Shine Spark?
[5:19:03] <prime_name> Was there a game where speed boost and shine spark were separate upgrades?
[5:19:04] <+Funky_Honkey> you can wall jump in speed booster and keep your momentum, it's the coolest
[5:19:05] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus What's up with people saying this game's controls are terrible?
[5:19:05] <%Deft_Thought> How much of Humanity would Woolie Sacrifice for such power? wooliePOYO
[5:19:11] <ElPlasa> @Parapattern ALL OF THEM
[5:19:14] <MisterSaintly> GOD THAT'S SEXY
[5:19:16] <Asuterisuku> @prime_name Nope. They were always together.
[5:19:21] <+DatAsuna> samus has also had shinespark for a hot minute and it was cool then too
[5:19:23] <Darren716> I think some people just hate using stick for 2D games
[5:19:25] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus Ballsparking is a thing
[5:19:27] <spawnzie> oh yeah try sliding during speed boost

[5:20:07] <DXLelouch24> you dont need hallways anymore WOOLIE
[5:20:08] <+HakureiIllusion> This one is insane
[5:20:09] <+Slattsquatch> Ready for bullshit shinespark puzzle #1
[5:20:14] <spawnzie> that one felt so good to actually pull off
[5:20:14] <Blank9> figure this missile out, it's great
[5:20:16] <DXLelouch24> Shinesparks limmiter has been REMOVED
[5:20:18] <Asuterisuku> You shinesparked from the nice long hallway needed for that.
[5:20:18] <+JGardner03> You can totally get this one now
[5:20:20] <+HakureiIllusion> Two ways to do it too, either from above or below
[5:20:22] <Darren716> Hey Woolie, how good at sparking are ya?
[5:20:24] <+scwry> Valuable info the game doesnt tell you : while speedboosting, you can jump, slide and wall jump, and still keep your momentum
[5:20:28] <+Funky_Honkey> @Slattsquatch it's really easy when you know the trick
[5:20:31] <essence_of_lariatto> it begins
[5:20:38] <ElPlasa> huh
[5:20:41] <+StatesmanPrimal> frick this missile
[5:20:52] <Asuterisuku> This one is fun~
[5:20:54] <AncelDeLambert> this one is ROUGH
[5:20:55] <valriot> Welcome to the Shinespark game
[5:20:56] <BlackermanZX> this speedbost puzzle is crazy
[5:20:56] <%rindy0> can he do this right now? I got here and thought i'm missing some gimmick with the green parts to get it
[5:20:59] <Blank9> you can do it
[5:20:59] <+D00msDayDan> took me a while to get this one
[5:21:00] <AncelDeLambert> this one is MEGA rough
[5:21:01] <+polothegreatest> diagonal speedbost LUL
[5:21:03] <kinkade_77> max had alot of fun with this one
[5:21:05] <essence_of_lariatto> this is the first test
[5:21:06] <%RyuuAoi> Indivisible shit?
[5:21:13] <spawnzie> you CAN do it with your current equipment
[5:21:16] <+Funky_Honkey> you can also press Y + B to cancel any action into a shinespark
[5:21:18] <Qsmash_> silly me tried to do it from the top
[5:21:27] <kragor__> this one took me like, an hour because I tried doing it the wrong way with later upgrades
[5:21:29] <+shootbang_exe> YEAH
[5:21:32] <+shootbang_exe> HE SAW IT
[5:21:34] <DXLelouch24> SHINE SPARK
[5:21:34] <%rindy0> any action? including jump?
[5:21:35] <ElPlasa> yeah?
[5:21:35] <spawnzie> YEAH
[5:21:37] <%RyTYoung> oooo
[5:21:44] <DXLelouch24> BALL SPARK
[5:21:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> the dots are connecting
[5:21:46] <+scwry> ballspark
[5:21:47] <spawnzie> SHINESPARL FROM BALL
[5:21:48] <valriot> :)
[5:21:48] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, that was in Zero Mission
[5:21:50] <KyberNasse> woolieGLORY
[5:21:51] <+Jonesman64> balll sparrrrk
[5:21:52] <+thelovingfool> you can ballspark yes
[5:21:54] <+Clyderso> BALL SPARK
[5:21:54] <+Funky_Honkey> @0rond yes
[5:21:54] <+StatesmanPrimal> you can tho
[5:21:56] <Asuterisuku> You could do that in Zero Mission too.
[5:21:56] <BlackermanZX> you can totally ball spark
[5:21:58] <dan_g_v> hey guys, how is the dread going so far?
[5:22:04] <+D00msDayDan> optimus, the ballspark is mine
[5:22:10] <+shootbang_exe> woolie is opening his third eye for sshinespark
[5:22:15] <essence_of_lariatto> I did it from below, no idea how you do it from above
[5:22:16] <DXLelouch24> The limiters are removed from shinesarpk in this game woolie, you can sequence break like a mofo
[5:22:21] <Darren716> ngl I did this one a different way much later when I opened that other door
[5:22:21] <+thelovingfool> @WoolieVersus hitting slopes rests the spark
[5:22:22] <DXLelouch24> shinespark*
[5:22:28] <+StatesmanPrimal> nah this one is way harder than you think
[5:22:28] <powerprotoman> you dont even know how fancy you need to be
[5:22:32] <+thelovingfool> the game doesnt tell you
[5:22:39] <+StatesmanPrimal> it took me a while to get that one
[5:22:39] <Saltmeisterr> theres one ingredient woolie is missing
[5:22:42] <%KetsuoTaberu> I don't see it tbh, no clue how it's done
[5:22:47] <spawnzie> They LOVE the fancy speed boost strats
[5:22:53] <NextTime000> oh it's this one
[5:22:55] <+Funky_Honkey> this is the hard way to do it, it's possible so go ahead
[5:22:57] <+sphiraki> you have to do it from below, this is the hard one
[5:22:58] <+shootbang_exe> you can also maintain speed boost through slides, jumps, AND wall jumps. It's wild this time around
[5:23:10] <essence_of_lariatto> Woolie missed one thing that helps point you in the right direction
[5:23:12] <Asuterisuku> The charge lasts a while, but not that long.
[5:23:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[5:23:19] <spawnzie> the shinespark lasts for about 5 seconds
[5:23:19] <+Slattsquatch> @sphiraki I did it the way Woolie's doing it, the timing is VERY tight though
[5:23:20] <Calek> speed boost puzzles are not stupid complex in this game, they're just rad
[5:23:25] <+HakureiIllusion> It's possible
[5:23:31] <SethYuikora> can you diagonal spark reliably?
[5:23:31] <Calek> @Slattsquatch really, congrats
[5:23:34] <NextTime000> I was watching somebody else going after this one and I fell asleep and missed how they did it
[5:23:36] <+sphiraki> @Slattsquatch i think both are pretty tight tbh, it's almost not worth the missles
[5:23:37] <Saltmeisterr> its the hard version woolie
[5:23:38] <DoctorMulholland> Maybe you have to come from below and speed-walljump up to it?
[5:23:41] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's easier from below in my opion
[5:23:42] <+Funky_Honkey> @sphiraki it's easier if you bomb, go up and reset your shinespark with the stairs and then do it.
[5:23:42] <redwidow1358> Diagonal shinesparks are easy
[5:23:42] <+scwry> theyre proper puzzles, and theyre great
[5:23:45] <+StatesmanPrimal> opinion
[5:23:52] <%RyuuAoi> Super Metroid goblins woolieOMG
[5:23:58] <+thelovingfool> you have to spark into the stairs to reset the spark timer
[5:24:03] <DXLelouch24> @KetsuoTaberu speed boost from the bottom and slide after wall jumping cause you keep your speed then  wall jump into shine spark into getting the powerup
[5:24:08] <%Prevot> wait you can reset in this?
[5:24:12] <kinkade_77> its too hard
[5:24:13] <+HakureiIllusion> Don't let yourself bomb-jump
[5:24:13] <+Funky_Honkey> yes
[5:24:15] <+thelovingfool> yeah
[5:24:18] <+thelovingfool> the lil slope
[5:24:22] <+scwry> yeah teres spark rest
[5:24:24] <%jonblnt> Slide
[5:24:26] <Asuterisuku> I got this one from below rather than above.
[5:24:29] <glass_marcus> oooohhh this onw
[5:24:40] <VictorBelmontVT> no you can boost into wall jump
[5:24:41] <+shootbang_exe> I got this one from below too
[5:24:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Might need a power bomb and slope reset
[5:24:41] <%KetsuoTaberu> @DXLelouch24 oh man that sounds tough
[5:24:44] <+polothegreatest> GDQ gonna be wild
[5:24:45] <BlackermanZX> UNLESS...
[5:24:47] <kinkade_77> UNLESS
[5:24:48] <mothdude> It IS doable. It's hard as hell though.
[5:24:50] <+StatesmanPrimal> tbf it's really cool if you do it from below
[5:24:50] <AncelDeLambert> I think this needs space jump...
[5:24:53] <%RyuuAoi> He CAN do it!
[5:24:56] <+TheMofologist> This one is got from sparking below.
[5:24:57] <%RyTYoung> It'll be way easier later on to get
[5:24:59] <Saltmeisterr> there are multiple solutions to this
[5:25:11] <essence_of_lariatto> It'll be just as hard later as now
[5:25:12] <spawnzie> yeah you can do it two wys
[5:25:20] <Asuterisuku> I found I had trouble initiating the spark in midair.
[5:25:21] <BlackermanZX> theres another solution to this
[5:25:24] <kentrix11> You can keep the speed boost through wall jumps and slides.
[5:25:25] <Blank9> I like the other way more
[5:25:26] <+shootbang_exe> has he figured out you can speed boost and wall jump or slide?
[5:25:29] <+scwry> its a well designed puzzle since theres multiple ways
[5:25:32] <powerprotoman> would you like a tip?
[5:25:32] <+thelovingfool> i had no idea wall jumping keps momentum from speed boost
[5:25:35] <spawnzie> the other way does look cooler
[5:25:39] <%mitchteck> You can diagonal spark
[5:25:42] <%RyTYoung> Don't bomb jump
[5:25:42] <+Funky_Honkey> Y + B to easily cancel into shinespark
[5:25:44] <kikoeru_san> it's the bomb jump that's fucking him
[5:25:54] <essence_of_lariatto> these shine spark puzzles are like a game unto themselves
[5:25:56] <Blank9> keep trying!
[5:25:56] <%jonblnt> You got this
[5:25:58] <spawnzie> DO IT AGAIN
[5:25:58] <Saltmeisterr> you are able to do this
[5:26:06] <+HakureiIllusion> ZL to morph ball, pressing down twice takes too much time
[5:26:07] <+thelovingfool> @WoolieVersus sparking into slopes resets the spark timer
[5:26:08] <Saltmeisterr> right now
[5:26:10] <ElPlasa> do you HAVE to bomb that tile? can it be missiled?
[5:26:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> kick, punch it's all in the mind
[5:26:12] <+scwry> oh chat are you meant to bomb the floor, jump back up and reset using the stairs?
[5:26:13] <+Jonesman64> You can also do something with speed booster I dont think you could do in previous metroid games...
[5:26:18] <kikoeru_san> he's learning
[5:26:20] <%ennui_on_me> @ElPlasa it has to be bombed
[5:26:31] <ElPlasa> damn
[5:26:33] <Saltmeisterr> @scwry to this solution im not sure
[5:26:33] <%RyTYoung> the enemy NotLikeThis
[5:26:38] <vstpnv> oh yeah speed boster is kinda shadow complex in this one
[5:26:38] <+Funky_Honkey> @scwry I reset on the stairs but you can do it the way Woolie is, it's just way harder for no reason
[5:26:41] <kikoeru_san> he has it though
[5:26:43] <+Fefe41> wow is Woolie pulling an all dayer for this
[5:26:44] <Saltmeisterr> i did the easier route
[5:26:54] <%RyTYoung> @scwry no just get off the bomb so you can get through quicker
[5:26:54] <ElPlasa> AAAAAAAA
[5:26:56] <+shootbang_exe> you can spark diagonal
[5:26:56] <+Dudealy> SO CLOSE
[5:26:58] <Saltmeisterr> but woolie doesn't know about shinespark wall jumps
[5:27:00] <%Sparkseid> close
[5:27:00] <AngryAsian5> DAMN
[5:27:00] <kikoeru_san> OOOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:27:03] <kinkade_77> wait you can actually do it this way?
[5:27:04] <%jonblnt> Close
[5:27:05] <dan_g_v> oof
[5:27:06] <+HakureiIllusion> Woolie is going to die inside when he finally reaches the walljump and doesn't know what to do
[5:27:09] <Qsmash_> and this is the easy one
[5:27:13] <+thelovingfool> you CAN do it wishout the reset but its frame perfect
[5:27:14] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie WILL figure it out
[5:27:15] <DeeVee_TV> this way is possible tho
[5:27:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> LUL
[5:27:19] <%RyTYoung> oof
[5:27:21] <kentrix11> You can shinespark in a diagonal Woolie.
[5:27:24] <BlackermanZX> if you spark diagonal you could do it
[5:27:25] <+scwry> air shinesparks feel harder in this than super
[5:27:26] <powerprotoman> oh so theirs three ways to do this tehn
[5:27:27] <spawnzie> Shinespark is 8 way now
[5:27:29] <+thelovingfool> is harder with spacejump i feel
[5:27:32] <pi_in_the_sci> it's 8 way, you don't need the wall jump
[5:27:36] <%jonblnt> Ganbatte
[5:27:38] <DoctorMulholland> Can you come from BELOW? There's another long hallway BELOW you that you might be able to walljump off of
[5:27:40] <dan_g_v> can you impact wall and launch away?
[5:27:42] <Darren716> There are 2 other ways to do it
[5:27:42] <+shieldanvil> oof
[5:27:44] <+Slattsquatch> @kinkade_77 This way works but it's probably harder than the other way
[5:27:49] <+shootbang_exe> @DoctorMulholland you absolutely can
[5:27:50] <Asuterisuku> B, not A
[5:27:51] <+StatesmanPrimal> @DoctorMulholland yeah you can, that's how i did it
[5:27:59] <jetstreamrey> you got this
[5:28:00] <SethYuikora> yeah, try a diagonal spark  from lower down maybe?
[5:28:02] <%jinking79> i hate how close he is by one move stopping him
[5:28:04] <Blank9> air shinespark is  easy if you shoot fire to go neutral, then spark
[5:28:04] <SunsetJack> You can't spinshark if you are spin jumping no?
[5:28:15] <+HakureiIllusion> Hint for Woolie: You can't shinespark out of a spin jump animation. Fire to cancel the animation before shinesparking.
[5:28:18] <%RealThiele> ZR gets you into ball faster
[5:28:21] <+Funky_Honkey> @SunsetJack you can, Y + B cancels into shinespark from anything
[5:28:36] <KyberNasse> Yeah you gotta shoot to get to neutral air stance
[5:28:37] <kragor__> yeah you can't spin jump into shinespark in this game unfortunately
[5:28:41] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh i didn't know you could cancel into shinespark
[5:28:41] <Zebroneath> You can also retain shinespark when wall jumping
[5:28:49] <BlackermanZX> also shinespark is 8 way
[5:28:55] <Saltmeisterr> woolie try wall jumping while boosting
[5:28:57] <kragor__> oh nvm??
[5:28:57] <+D00msDayDan> yo i didn't know you can shine spark midair with Y+B that's a game changer
[5:29:03] <DoctorMulholland> Try DOWN Woolie
[5:29:04] <%RyuuAoi> No wall bounce at end?
[5:29:07] <VictorBelmontVT> shinespark can be done in all 8 directions
[5:29:07] <+Funky_Honkey> he figured it out
[5:29:10] <+scwry> yessir
[5:29:17] <kragor__> yessir
[5:29:18] <+TaurusOxford> it does.
[5:29:18] <+itslapdog> diagonal shinespark, woolie. no walljumping required
[5:29:19] <%RyTYoung> Do a diagonal Shine Spark
[5:29:19] <+Funky_Honkey> you aimed down
[5:29:22] <+Funky_Honkey> god
[5:29:22] <+scwry> it will
[5:29:22] <thackattack00> yes it does
[5:29:26] <Asuterisuku> It DOES create a reset, but there's not much point in doing it there.
[5:29:30] <+Slattsquatch> I did a single jump into shinespark, I'm not sure if you have enough time to walljump and THEN shinespark
[5:29:32] <Blank9> def try the down one too, it's fun
[5:29:33] <+thelovingfool> shinesparking into a slope restets the timer
[5:29:38] <+shootbang_exe> silly wooljie still thinking in 4 directions
[5:29:39] <SunsetJack> It does, you shinespark down when you were suppose to do it forward.
[5:29:41] <+Funky_Honkey> @Asuterisuku he can bomb and reset
[5:30:00] <+TaurusOxford> you have to shinespark into a slope, and then press down again to hold the charge
[5:30:02] <+scwry> you pressed down when you tried the reset
[5:30:03] <Asuterisuku> The blocks will reform by the time he gets back down though.
[5:30:06] <Explodincatz> is this Woolies first Metroid as well?
[5:30:18] <Asuterisuku> @Explodincatz It is not.
[5:30:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:30:20] <+StatesmanPrimal> yo wait you can reset shinespark PogChamp
[5:30:23] <+Take_2_shots> Neutral jump
[5:30:25] <+thelovingfool> ye
[5:30:26] <dan_g_v> this is woolz first Metroid, yes
[5:30:34] <+TheMofologist> What youre supposed to do looks a lot cooler than what you‚Äôre doing now you‚Äôre
[5:30:37] <+FrostySoftServe> its not
[5:30:39] <Saltmeisterr> theres alot more room to this puzzle than you think wools
[5:30:41] <%Dr00_PhD> this is def not his first
[5:30:43] <brachydios777> @dan_g_v On the channel
[5:30:45] <SethYuikora> does it not eat energy in this game?
[5:30:48] <+CloudsBringRain> he's played others before
[5:30:50] <ct_2> needs to be a bigger slope to wrok in this
[5:30:55] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs 8 way
[5:30:56] <Asuterisuku> Only in Super it eats energy.
[5:30:58] <dan_g_v> this is woolz first met4oid, yep
[5:31:00] <%jonblnt> Ganbatte
[5:31:07] <+scwry> try from below
[5:31:09] <%RyuuAoi> WOOLIE FIGURED IT OUT
[5:31:09] <VictorBelmontVT> you can also do it diagonally
[5:31:10] <+HakureiIllusion> No need to reset, it's doable without reset
[5:31:13] <BlackermanZX> theres one thing woolie hasnt tried with shinespark
[5:31:15] <Daleksek53> brownBACKSEAT
[5:31:24] <powerprotoman> so wall jumping while speed boosting preserves momentum you need to come inform the bottom sliding into the room via a speed boost entrance and wall jump up into it
[5:31:27] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus try wall jumping during boost
[5:31:31] <+thelovingfool> you sparksharge?bomb>shinespark slope to reset> then do it
[5:31:44] <+Funky_Honkey> @powerprotoman don't just tell him
[5:31:45] <%brandt_connors> someone didn't do the metroid fusion shinespark skip
[5:31:46] <fairore> you can slide and jump while speed boosting
[5:31:47] <kikoeru_san> Will Woolie see chat tell him he can walljump the shine spark
[5:31:48] <+HakureiIllusion> You more or less had it, just gotta be a little quicker
[5:32:01] <+polothegreatest> can you air dash and mantain speed boost?
[5:32:02] <+rahunin> shinespark can continue through multiple wall jumps
[5:32:26] <%brandt_connors> stock it after the bomb again with the ramp
[5:32:33] <+Alvarado94> !uptime
[5:32:33] <@Moobot> @Alvarado94 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 43 minutes
[5:32:34] <Asuterisuku> Letting yourself fall is the error. Air dash before hitting the ground ?
[5:32:38] <powerprotoman> @powerprotoman they way hes doing it works too
[5:32:40] <+polothegreatest> SirPrise
[5:32:40] <%RyTYoung> nearly!
[5:32:42] <Blank9> so close
[5:32:43] <jorniev> how did woolie feel about BIRDGIL
[5:32:44] <SethYuikora> i believe
[5:32:47] <DoctorMulholland> @WoolieVersus you keep coming in from above, try coming in from below
[5:32:50] <+scwry> that could work
[5:32:51] <BlackermanZX> so close to victory
[5:32:54] <Elfangor01> no wall jump?
[5:32:55] <brachydios777> He found it
[5:32:56] <spawnzie> no this is good
[5:32:57] <Darren716> jorniev Exactly how you'd expect
[5:32:59] <+thelovingfool> wait can you shinespark while falling down the slope?
[5:33:00] <dan_g_v> straight up and then left?
[5:33:00] <reginault> nakkiCB we in the lab
[5:33:01] <+D00msDayDan> don't worry woolie this is content
[5:33:02] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's fine
[5:33:02] <%RyTYoung> @elfangor01 ye wall jump
[5:33:03] <+HakureiIllusion> Everyone wants to see you do it, ignore the game until you get it
[5:33:03] <%RealThiele> like 90% of the way there
[5:33:04] <DXLelouch24> there a much easier way tho
[5:33:04] <redwidow1358> It's cool man, you do you
[5:33:06] <%RyuuAoi> I believe you can fly. Woooo
[5:33:09] <DXLelouch24> from the bottom
[5:33:10] <+Slattsquatch> Almost there, just have to be a little faster
[5:33:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> you can wallspark
[5:33:14] <+scwry> fire and youll enter neurtal
[5:33:16] <Zebroneath> You're fine.  I like seeing your thought process.
[5:33:17] <BlackermanZX> now theres another way to do this
[5:33:17] <VictorBelmontVT> wall jump
[5:33:19] <Asuterisuku> @thelovingfool You can, and some of the pickups require it.
[5:33:20] <powerprotoman> 8 way
[5:33:21] <%RealThiele> You do the thing
[5:33:22] <%jonblnt> Woolie gotta Wolz
[5:33:24] <jett_eyes> can you not do it off a wall jump?
[5:33:26] <+Funky_Honkey> spin jump and cancel into shinespark with Y+B
[5:33:30] <kikoeru_san> wall jump the shine spark
[5:33:31] <%brandt_connors> you can jump left right withput triggering can't you?
[5:33:34] <%RyTYoung> do a tiny jump, then diagonal Shine spark
[5:33:35] <kragor__> I'm enjoying seeing someone else struggle through this pretty much the exact same way i did lol
[5:33:37] <Darren716> You can come back to this since you have to come to this exact area later anyways
[5:33:37] <spawnzie> fire to cancel a spin jump then shinespark?
[5:33:38] <+Jonesman64> you can speed boost and wall jump.. i dont think you can shine wall jump
[5:33:42] <+Funky_Honkey> @kikoeru_san doesn't work
[5:33:42] <+MrUnKnownAlien> dont store it just wall jump
[5:33:46] <brachydios777> Diagnol?
[5:33:55] <spawnzie> THERE IT IS
[5:33:55] <%Artoo__The_Me> Maybe put the bomb when you leave?
[5:33:56] <+Funky_Honkey> there
[5:33:56] <SethYuikora> almost bois
[5:33:57] <Blank9> whoa
[5:33:57] <+scwry> GOT IT
[5:33:57] <+Slattsquatch> SO CLOSE
[5:33:58] <BlackermanZX> THERE
[5:33:59] <+Funky_Honkey> he figured it out
[5:34:01] <+sphiraki> SO CLOSE
[5:34:01] <jorniev> HOLY SHIT
[5:34:02] <Louie_Salmon> YEYEYE
[5:34:02] <+HakureiIllusion> THAT WAS IT

[5:34:05] <%Prevot> damn
[5:34:06] <jett_eyes> alright, there it is
[5:34:07] <valriot> You can shine diagonally too
[5:34:07] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> man it's really cool that you can get it this way too
[5:34:08] <kentrix11> Almost there
[5:34:08] <TheCamsan> It's ok Woolz, we all gotta bit of OCD lol
[5:34:10] <KyberNasse> The spark puzzles are some fighting game trial shit, its fun
[5:34:10] <+polothegreatest> holysht thats cool
[5:34:14] <brachydios777> Almost
[5:34:15] <dan_g_v> ok that scared me a little

[5:34:58] <ElPlasa> YOU GOT THIS MY DUDE
[5:34:59] <+Slattsquatch> IS THIS THE RUN

[5:35:10] <brachydios777> We Believe
[5:35:10] <+theDesender> WINNABLE
[5:35:11] <redwidow1358> You really should just dash into the stairs and reset your charge after bombing the blocks
[5:35:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> DO IT
[5:35:14] <spawnzie> DONT GIVE UP
[5:35:15] <VictorBelmontVT> dont give up

[5:35:42] <kikoeru_san> MIND GOBLINS SLAYED
[5:35:43] <%jonblnt> Ganbatte!
[5:35:44] <Asuterisuku> I did it by wall-jumping from below without a Shinespark.
[5:35:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> CLIP IT AND POST IT ON TWITTER NOW
[5:35:46] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> now do it the other way!
[5:35:46] <%a_goth_pancake> all that for 2 missiles.
[5:35:46] <AngryAsian5> HE DID THE THING!!!
[5:35:48] <+Jonesman64> You can also come from the opposite way which is what I did xD
[5:35:51] <+rahunin> nice, I got that one a comepletly different way
[5:35:52] <Louie_Salmon> Low% World Record when?
[5:35:52] <dan_g_v> breath deep in and then out
[5:35:52] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus btw the easier way its doing it from bellow
[5:35:54] <%RyTYoung> Reload your save Kappa
[5:35:54] <Jaller101514> was that a mr snip snip episode?
[5:36:00] <kinkade_77> btw the easy way was to do it from the bottom
[5:36:00] <jett_eyes> GOBLIN SLAUGHTERED
[5:36:00] <nintega010> yeah
[5:36:03] <OfficerMods> does woolie know?
[5:36:03] <SethYuikora> BALLSPARK
[5:36:04] <Vynith> yeah I wall jumped from below
[5:36:06] <Asuterisuku> Oh yeah, time to Ball Spark
[5:36:07] <DoctorMulholland> @WoolieVersus there's a totally easier way to get it than how you did it SeemsGood
[5:36:09] <Pylohn> nice i didnt think it was actually possable now ill have to go back and try it again
[5:36:11] <%jonblnt> Yatte!
[5:36:11] <KyberNasse> Some game huh :)
[5:36:12] <+scwry> Ah i see the below path now
[5:36:13] <+extradopeness> did you just say "based" right then
[5:36:16] <Saltmeisterr> other side
[5:36:16] <+Slattsquatch> It's a missile tank+ so honestly worth it
[5:36:16] <Darren716> Now to spark your balls
[5:36:18] <Zebroneath> This is the other way of getting to the missle
[5:36:21] <+Dudealy> oh boy you're seeing it now
[5:36:22] <essence_of_lariatto> that's the other way of doing it
[5:36:23] <BlackermanZX> you did it the hard way lmao
[5:36:25] <Blank9> more tech to learn!
[5:36:27] <+scwry> you can wall jump from a speedboost
[5:36:28] <powerprotoman> so wall umping preserves speed boost
[5:36:30] <+Jonesman64> Speed boost wall juuuump
[5:36:32] <+StatesmanPrimal> from the bottom emmi door
[5:36:33] <DXLelouch24> @go outside you did it the hard way
[5:36:34] <jett_eyes> nah, theres gotta be another way
[5:36:37] <VictorBelmontVT> wall jump speed boost
[5:36:38] <spawnzie> you gotta start in the emmi room
[5:36:39] <+thelovingfool> like the stretch directly to your right
[5:36:40] <Darren716> Ohhh yeah this way is fun
[5:36:41] <Saltmeisterr> wall jumping perserves boost
[5:36:41] <+rahunin> other side
[5:36:44] <Asuterisuku> You can use the Emmi door.
[5:36:44] <Zebroneath> You can walljump while speed boosting
[5:36:47] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> this speedboost is better
[5:36:47] <%RealThiele> that ramp
[5:36:47] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus go outside you did it the hard way
[5:36:48] <+scwry> this starts all the way from the mmi room
[5:36:50] <+Funky_Honkey> you can maintain speed booster with wall jumps
[5:36:58] <Darren716> From all the way back
[5:36:58] <GenmaKido> https://clips.twitch.tv/BloodyShakingOtterPRChase-5Gnz-LBoNP3WmKMt
[5:37:03] <DXLelouch24> slide maintains speed boost
[5:37:12] <SethYuikora> show us your power woolie
[5:37:14] <Darren716> Legit go back to the emmi room
[5:37:16] <spawnzie> slides and walljumps maintain the speed
[5:37:24] <Blank9> nope
[5:37:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:37:24] <Asuterisuku> That's actually supposed to be the solution to the missile tank above, the way to maintain the speed boost through the corridor.
[5:37:27] <+Jonesman64> NOpe
[5:37:27] <kikoeru_san> WOOLIE NO
[5:37:28] <Saltmeisterr> nope
[5:37:29] <BlackermanZX> wall jump and slide maintains speedboost
[5:37:32] <powerprotoman> wrong
[5:37:32] <+StatesmanPrimal> nope
[5:37:33] <Darren716> No
[5:37:33] <+rahunin> green room
[5:37:33] <thackattack00> nooooo
[5:37:34] <Saltmeisterr> NO woolie
[5:37:34] <kikoeru_san> NO NO NO NO
[5:37:34] <+SurphNTurph> no
[5:37:38] <+thelovingfool> you can also do the slope reset
[5:37:39] <kikoeru_san> IMPOSSIBLE
[5:37:41] <Darren716> Woolie go to the emmi room
[5:37:41] <%Prevot> that's impossible
[5:37:44] <+Jonesman64> OTHER WAY
[5:37:45] <%RealThiele> nein
[5:37:47] <+HakureiIllusion> Thinking of it backwards.
[5:37:48] <Jaller101514> bottom up
[5:37:50] <spawnzie> backwards
[5:37:51] <powerprotoman> you come from the other way
[5:37:52] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus yea it is right
[5:37:52] <+scwry> Woolie you can now jump, slide and wall jump through a speedboost
[5:37:54] <DXLelouch24> try it
[5:37:58] <+Take_2_shots> You could do it from the last checkpoint
[5:37:59] <SethYuikora> do it for the speedrun strats
[5:38:16] <Sonny_Firestorm> ROCKET
[5:38:17] <jett_eyes> OH
[5:38:20] <Asuterisuku> The camera shift too.
[5:38:20] <+MisterAvry> coooool
[5:38:24] <Asuterisuku> They know you're doing something COOL.
[5:38:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> Kappa
[5:38:28] <pi_in_the_sci> tank
[5:38:29] <Darren716> Easy e-tank
[5:38:33] <spawnzie> they KNOW
[5:38:35] <DXLelouch24> someone make sure to expose Woolies balls about the easier way after this is over
[5:38:35] <%RealThiele> E
[5:38:36] <+extradopeness> that scripted moment is the shitttt
[5:38:37] <Asuterisuku> E
[5:38:37] <DXLelouch24> on twitter
[5:38:44] <Gelphaze> super cool!
[5:38:45] <SethYuikora> game's animated really well
[5:38:48] <%RyuuAoi> This game might be good
[5:39:01] <Darren716> Go down
[5:39:06] <Asuterisuku> I don't think Woolie played Samus Returns; he'd know what those are if he did.
[5:39:07] <VictorBelmontVT> Local man doesn't pay attention to map
[5:39:08] <Darren716> No
[5:39:09] <pi_in_the_sci> big e-tank in that last room
[5:39:14] <+extradopeness> this game might be 10/10
[5:39:16] <Darren716> E TANK
[5:39:20] <VictorBelmontVT> E TANK
[5:39:23] <%RealThiele> RIP E
[5:39:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> If we could mod Nintendo games, I'd put the Sonic Colors voice saying ROCKET over that ability. LUL
[5:39:29] <Saltmeisterr> i wish the game told you that you can wall jump during speed boost
[5:39:32] <ataxia72> how is woolie liking the game so far?
[5:39:37] <NeroInfinite> RIP Etank
[5:39:41] <Asuterisuku> It's not Prime timing.
[5:39:42] <Darren716> Woolie plz
[5:39:45] <%RyuuAoi> Can he?
[5:39:52] <glass_marcus> feel the rhythm
[5:39:52] <DXLelouch24> yes
[5:39:55] <TigerClaws12> KEEP THE  RHYTHM UP
[5:39:56] <DXLelouch24> cause i idd
[5:39:56] <+shootbang_exe> I can't wait for woolie to figure out speed boosts can have wall jumps and slides
[5:39:58] <DXLelouch24> did*
[5:40:03] <Darren716> Go back 1 room
[5:40:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> The rhythm isn't hard
[5:40:04] <+doe3879> spam it?
[5:40:06] <+rahunin> you can stand in there
[5:40:07] <brunoberserk> bomb jumping looks easier in this game
[5:40:07] <%Prevot> LUL
[5:40:14] <TigerClaws12> LIGHT PUNCH
[5:40:15] <%RyuuAoi> COWARD
[5:40:17] <+extradopeness> its an easy rhythm
[5:40:17] <Darren716> yay
[5:40:57] <Asuterisuku> He's messing it by going for the Prime timing.
[5:40:59] <VictorBelmontVT> you can jump as the ball, don't need to double bomb the bottom
[5:41:02] <powerprotoman> its lower noirfairs beat
[5:41:09] <Asuterisuku> You need the SM timing.
[5:41:19] <TigerClaws12> HEAVY PUNCH ULTRA
[5:41:20] <%RealThiele> bop bop, bop bop
[5:41:28] <AngryAsian5> YEAAH
[5:41:31] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie, you did it in smash!
[5:41:33] <+extradopeness> easy rhythm
[5:41:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Huzzah
[5:41:43] <%RyuuAoi> I SEENT IT
[5:41:57] <+shootbang_exe> you can ballspark
[5:41:59] <Blank9> neutral spark
[5:42:00] <+thelovingfool> press b
[5:42:00] <Asuterisuku> Press B while stationary.
[5:42:05] <Darren716> Nah press b
[5:42:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> NEUTRAL B
[5:42:08] <Asuterisuku> Then pick a direction.
[5:42:14] <+TaurusOxford> you can ballspark - just neutral jump and then hold a direction
[5:42:22] <SethYuikora> YEET
[5:42:24] <+MisterAvry> neat
[5:42:25] <+thelovingfool> BALLSPARK
[5:42:25] <%RyuuAoi> PROGRESS
[5:42:30] <Sonny_Firestorm> hegehodge
[5:42:30] <NeroInfinite> He figured it out
[5:42:33] <+extradopeness> sheeesh
[5:42:35] <Monkeyweed21> MORPH SHINE
[5:42:36] <Asuterisuku> Zero Mission introduced that.
[5:42:38] <BlackermanZX> BALL SPARK
[5:42:43] <+MisterAvry> spin dash
[5:42:46] <+TaurusOxford> Zero Mission
[5:42:46] <OfficerMods> that was in fusion
[5:42:47] <Zebroneath> That was in Zero Mission
[5:42:47] <AncelDeLambert> that was in Zero Mission
[5:42:48] <OfficerMods> oh boy was it
[5:42:52] <+HakureiIllusion> Zero Mission, not Fusion
[5:42:52] <Asuterisuku> It was NOT in Fusion.
[5:42:52] <Blank9> there's more to do without holding spark too
[5:42:53] <+extradopeness> ZM not fusion
[5:42:56] <Saltmeisterr> theres another tech u can do woolie
[5:43:01] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus can you do charge shot into morph ball?
[5:43:01] <Saltmeisterr> with speed booster
[5:43:03] <OfficerMods> what wasn't there a e tank puzzle that used the ball spark
[5:43:08] <OfficerMods> or was that the ramp trick
[5:43:10] <%RealThiele> nah fusion shinespark was a bit limited
[5:43:11] <+Take_2_shots> was required to 100% complete Zero
[5:43:12] <Shwepie> Woolie playing Dread, my day is made.
[5:43:28] <kinkade_77> i hope they get to make that fusion remake now
[5:43:33] <Asuterisuku> You could use it to get early Super Missiles in ZM and skip a miniboss.
[5:43:35] <%jinking79> Samus returns u had to use smart bomb to do that
[5:43:42] <Aydarkzero> wollie lost in the tech
[5:43:46] <BlackermanZX> Spark puzzles are so fun
[5:43:49] <%Prevot> fusion doesn't need a remake
[5:43:58] <Parapattern> The Shine Spark Euphoria
[5:44:05] <Darren716> Power bomb jumps were the raddest shit in returns
[5:44:10] <KyberNasse> Woolie Vs Shinespark
[5:44:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can jump or walljump and then uncurl for a neutral B in air
[5:44:13] <Asuterisuku> That's doable.
[5:44:15] <essence_of_lariatto> don't worry, there are plenty of those to fo around
[5:44:20] <dan_g_v> diagonal?
[5:44:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:44:27] <Saltmeisterr> some day woolie with find out he can wall jump during speed boost
[5:44:33] <Asuterisuku> Shinespark straight across from the upper platform maybe?
[5:44:49] <Cal_ixo> Grapple points maybe?
[5:44:52] <+extradopeness> i got to such a good spot i am happy to say this game has exceeded all i expected from it and im not even done yet
[5:44:54] <Cal_ixo> nvm lol
[5:44:54] <DevilHands_> yo
[5:44:59] <Blank9> nice
[5:44:59] <+MisterAvry> nice
[5:45:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nice
[5:45:02] <Asuterisuku> Yo.
[5:45:02] <fairore> nice
[5:45:11] <SethYuikora> now we're cookin' with nuclear waste
[5:45:14] <Asuterisuku> That's an easy one lol
[5:45:14] <Bananassassin> This game's fantastic. 100%'d it in 2 days and some change and am learning sequence breaks rn.
[5:45:16] <pi_in_the_sci> that wasn't even a shinespark puzzle, nice
[5:45:17] <jett_eyes> very niceo
[5:45:21] <Shwepie> @extradopeness Just finished it, it gets better as it goes.
[5:45:23] <essence_of_lariatto> this part took me a while to figure out where to go
[5:45:57] <SethYuikora> parries heal you so much
[5:46:07] <essence_of_lariatto> I didn't know it could do that
[5:46:09] <Asuterisuku> It followed you through the door lol
[5:46:16] <Shwepie> They brought back enemies going through doors from Metroid 1!
[5:46:26] <SethYuikora> the juggles
[5:46:35] <Asuterisuku> I remember having to do that for secrets in M1
[5:46:51] <Asuterisuku> You'd bring a flying enemy through so you could freeze it with the ice beam.
[5:46:56] <%RyuuAoi> Dread gonna make you get good!
[5:46:57] <+extradopeness> samus is so cool guys
[5:47:00] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus theres more things u can do with the speed booster
[5:47:01] <Darren716> I think there were some speed blocks a room back
[5:47:15] <Asuterisuku> Easy spark in the center of this room.
[5:47:19] <greatspaceadventure> @extradopeness way too cool for schrubs like us
[5:47:53] <Shwepie> Hesitation is defeat.
[5:47:54] <jett_eyes> man, he's just drowning in missles
[5:48:03] <Asuterisuku> Flash Shift already forgotten, Return of Shinespark.
[5:48:11] <BlackermanZX> Flash who
[5:48:32] <Saltmeisterr> wall jump speed booster tho
[5:48:42] <Blank9> less spark, more speed boost
[5:48:46] <jett_eyes> as a ball
[5:48:49] <Daxalog> Drunk sparking
[5:48:55] <+shieldanvil> isn't that basically the sonic series?
[5:48:56] <%RyuuAoi> Scared
[5:49:02] <Shwepie> Hope there's no boats in the way.
[5:49:04] <%jinking79> like A Train LUL
[5:49:07] <Asuterisuku> That door is forever open now.
[5:49:16] <%Deft_Thought> If there's no ramp then you're in for a Man of Steel moment
[5:49:19] <+extradopeness> or a whale breaking
[5:49:22] <+DatAsuna> I could also go for a death stranding zipline across the ocean. lol
[5:49:55] <jett_eyes> ziplines were really good in DS, wish i used them more

[5:50:06] <Asuterisuku> Woolie stumbles onto the critical path.
[5:50:18] <Saltmeisterr> woolie'
[5:50:19] <%Deft_Thought> Now I dunno how well that works without a super powered alien suit
[5:50:20] <fairore> yes
[5:50:24] <Saltmeisterr> you can do that
[5:50:28] <Saltmeisterr> well
[5:50:33] <Monkeyweed21> @Asuterisuku the Shinespark guided woolie to the critical path
[5:50:37] <+A_Mighty_Walrus> shoutout to dragoon powers
[5:50:39] <pi_in_the_sci> not yet
[5:50:41] <Saltmeisterr> u can change directions with speedbooster
[5:50:43] <DeadManProp> Yo, hello everyone
[5:50:45] <essence_of_lariatto> this is a nice glow up for an old power
[5:51:08] <TheCamsan> this new Metroid looking slick
[5:51:12] <+MisterAvry> awww yeah
[5:51:14] <reginault> grapple nakkiUwU
[5:51:16] <Asuterisuku> The game is super sick.
[5:51:20] <+MisterAvry> getting all sorts of good stuff
[5:51:25] <+DatAsuna> "still not at full power"
[5:51:26] <DXLelouch24> it doesnt suck like Super either
[5:51:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Grapple deez Nuts Kappa
[5:51:37] <Asuterisuku> @DXLelouch24 Them's fightin' words.
[5:51:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[5:51:40] <+MisterAvry> oooh, and blue blocks!
[5:51:45] <%Prevot> don't usually like 2d grapple but this one is ok
[5:51:51] <DXLelouch24> @Asuterisuku take it up with Max
[5:52:01] <jett_eyes> god damn, from one powerup to the next
[5:52:02] <Shwepie> Dread uses all the buttons except up and down on D-pad. Some of them do multiple things even.
[5:52:15] <essence_of_lariatto> @Asuterisuku I think he meant the grapple sucked IN super
[5:52:17] <essence_of_lariatto> which it does
[5:52:22] <DXLelouch24> correct
[5:52:28] <%jinking79> now how many enemies can be grappled
[5:52:43] <DXLelouch24> one
[5:52:44] <essence_of_lariatto> you can grapple the laser dudes off the ceiling
[5:52:45] <Darren716> The important ones can
[5:52:46] <Asuterisuku> I thought he was saying SUPER sucked and I was like "huh?"
[5:52:47] <+legitimatejohnathan> Shine spark AND Grapple? happy birthday woolie
[5:53:04] <DXLelouch24> no Super doesnt suck, this is better than it tho
[5:53:08] <Asuterisuku> Flash Shift, Shinespark, and Grapple Beam.
[5:53:22] <Asuterisuku> Woolie finding all the cool powers.
[5:53:33] <essence_of_lariatto> You just start snowballing abilities in this game
[5:53:40] <DXLelouch24> oh your nowhere near endgame
[5:53:41] <%Prevot> this game has a lot of powerups
[5:53:44] <+extradopeness> it dont stop
[5:53:47] <%RyTYoung> You're going at a good pace
[5:53:48] <kinkade_77> this game just keeps on going and never slows down
[5:53:48] <DXLelouch24> your not even 50%
[5:53:50] <%RyuuAoi> Suit strong
[5:53:58] <Jaller101514> try shooting the left wall
[5:54:03] <essence_of_lariatto> I'd say this is the halfway point
[5:54:04] <OfficerMods> christ woolie is tearing through this game
[5:54:06] <+extradopeness> tubes
[5:54:14] <OfficerMods> he's actually somewhat close to the end
[5:54:21] <Darren716> Eh
[5:54:23] <Asuterisuku> Not that close.
[5:54:24] <DXLelouch24> no hes not
[5:54:25] <BlackermanZX> but not really
[5:54:28] <Shwepie> @Jaller101514 But then he'll get big boy bombs early and break the game!
[5:54:32] <Darren716> When he hits the cutscene he'll be halfway I feel
[5:54:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Not even halfway
[5:54:36] <bippityjones> This is like 1/3rd I think
[5:54:36] <DXLelouch24> ive beaten it, hes not close at all
[5:54:46] <OfficerMods> oh right i forgot about a section
[5:54:48] <greatspaceadventure> this game has very crisp gameplay and the whole game world is just designed around manipulating that crispness to move how you need
[5:54:51] <OfficerMods> yeah he's like 1/3
[5:54:55] <nintega010> I'm waiting for woolie to react to one cutscen
[5:54:58] <Saltmeisterr> theres a cool sequence break u can do in the ice area
[5:55:02] <BlackermanZX> the map in this game is massive
[5:55:03] <jorniev> yeah but he is going for the secrets too
[5:55:04] <essence_of_lariatto> going for 100% changes your idea of what an average playthrough is
[5:55:04] <Saltmeisterr> its fancy ass hell
[5:55:10] <Jaller101514> it just says you cant use em yet. its a fun sequence break kind of thing
[5:55:26] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie will NEVER beat Dread
[5:55:27] <DXLelouch24> i didnt go for 100% on my first run so no hes not close
[5:55:38] <Asuterisuku> A way back is never nothing.
[5:55:51] <Darren716> It's weird I got to basically the end on day 1, then yesterday and early this morning was all clean up and actually beating it
[5:56:02] <kinkade_77> anyone have the rough time for a 100% of this game?
[5:56:04] <Blank9> there's grapple beam doors too
[5:56:10] <jorniev> is there a wierd sequence break thing like in fusion?
[5:56:12] <Darren716> I got 100% in 10 hours
[5:56:12] <pi_in_the_sci> there's also grapple doors
[5:56:16] <+Jonesman64> wow.. i didn't know you could do that on the map...
[5:56:17] <greatspaceadventure> @kinkade_77 i'd say like 7-10 hours based on what i'm hearing recently
[5:56:19] <redwidow1358> 100% is 8 to 20 hours depending
[5:56:23] <Darren716> Granted that's the in-game timer
[5:56:24] <DXLelouch24> @jorniev multiple
[5:56:28] <jorniev> damn
[5:56:38] <OfficerMods> I put it down for a while to practice melty but i wanna get back in to try out the various sequence breaks
[5:56:40] <Asuterisuku> My 100% playthrough was 10 hours. Admittedly most of which was cleanup.
[5:57:00] <Darren716> Clean up is best saved for doing it all at the end
[5:57:02] <Saltmeisterr> theres one u can do in this area @jorniev
[5:57:10] <Darren716> When you can just bum rush through zones
[5:57:20] <dukenux> whoa still goin? that good, huh
[5:57:45] <pi_in_the_sci> up to the green zone
[5:58:16] <+extradopeness> yah its pretty. good
[5:58:29] <+Nekolaius> nice bomb jumps
[5:58:38] <+disgruntledgruntle> @WoolieVersus Are u enjoying it so far?
[5:58:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:59:02] <Asuterisuku> You can do it from this side.
[5:59:42] <Asuterisuku> Speed Boost blocks stay destroyed permanently in this game so you can do your secret hunting at your liesure.
[6:00:04] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh damn
[6:00:16] <+extradopeness> god-like
[6:00:45] <%Akizea> super bombs maybe?
[6:01:07] <Saltmeisterr> this puzzle he can't do yet
[6:01:09] <Blank9> oh this fucking one
[6:01:12] <AncelDeLambert> need time skip
[6:01:12] <Blank9> he can
[6:01:13] <Asuterisuku> You cannot do this yet.
[6:01:26] <@Menitta> I cant wrap my head around this one
[6:01:29] <Blank9> you can with ball sparking
[6:01:46] <Shwepie> @Saltmeisterr I did it without the item that makes it easy. Shinespark baby!
[6:01:59] <Saltmeisterr> oh right
[6:02:01] <%RyTYoung> it can't be done
[6:02:07] <Jaller101514> "timestop"
[6:02:21] <+extradopeness> but you gotta get the bomb there
[6:02:22] <Asuterisuku> Does ball spark break missile blocks?
[6:02:22] <%mitchteck> Timestop required
[6:02:31] <Qsmash_> shinespark doesn't remove bomb blocks or missile blocks
[6:02:31] <%KetsuoTaberu> samus can have a little ballspark, as a treat
[6:02:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Man, the late game makes you fucking learn to parry.
[6:02:40] <kinkade_77> samus is stronger than kirby.
[6:02:43] <Blank9> you can do it without anything but bombs, missiles, and spark
[6:02:50] <Calek> @kinkade_77 ha no
[6:02:53] <iamnotaparrot> is this gonna be a YouTube VOD?
[6:03:18] <%FenixSeraph> FenixSeraph subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Heyo, hope you're having a good time with this game. Metroid is back baby!
[6:03:24] <%RyTYoung> @iamnotaparrot it'll most likely go up as episodes on the channel
[6:03:44] <+extradopeness> if kirby could copy shinespark, he could have a chance
[6:03:51] <Asuterisuku> I actually forget where to go from here too.
[6:03:53] <@Menitta> yeah thats how it should be played
[6:03:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Are u gonna do this in 1 go?
[6:04:00] <Calek> 100% is not bad to get in this game, rather easy
[6:04:05] <jett_eyes> bro thats the one mind goblin I have: missing out on content
[6:04:13] <dukenux> how many times do you get to use shunespark in this
[6:04:24] <essence_of_lariatto> A lot
[6:04:30] <+JonathLP> 30 to 50
[6:04:31] <%RyTYoung> ofc take your time, take all the extraterrestrials wooliePOYO
[6:04:31] <Gelphaze> Oh yea take your time with this one, this one is a treasure!
[6:04:32] <DaCheekyOne> Has woolie played Hollowknight?
[6:04:34] <TigerClaws12> AVENGE SHAKIRA
[6:04:38] <dukenux> cool
[6:04:39] <Blank9> kirby can barely handle wheel and crashes every warp star, he would kill himself with shinespark
[6:04:40] <valriot> Quick, get Shakira
[6:04:41] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus theres a sequence break here u can do if ur feeling ballsy enough
[6:04:53] <%FenixSeraph> how far is Woolie into the game?
[6:04:55] <iamnotaparrot> my ocd forced me to try and illuminate every map pixel every time I entered a new room and it made my first playthrough take forever
[6:04:56] <fairore> woolie has played hollowknight
[6:04:56] <dukenux> Get Shakira's tax returns
[6:04:59] <hollumdusk> @jett_eyes That's a mind goblin that almost destroyed my playthrough of Witcher 3.
[6:04:59] <+extradopeness> yeh he played HK but not the DLC stuff i dont think
[6:05:08] <%FenixSeraph> has he met Sebulba yet?
[6:05:27] <Qsmash_> metroid no like cold
[6:05:29] <Asuterisuku> Woolie not recognizing the different map colours.
[6:05:31] <Daxalog> I would think you would have enough health to just tank the damage over time
[6:05:33] <%KetsuoTaberu> it's too c-c-c-cold
[6:05:34] <Saltmeisterr> oh maybe :)
[6:05:39] <+extradopeness> lol sebulba
[6:05:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:05:39] <Saltmeisterr> or*
[6:05:54] <+extradopeness> no he hasnt met sebulba
[6:06:04] <jett_eyes> @jett_eyes man don't even get me started with open world type games
[6:06:19] <jett_eyes> shit I replied to myself
[6:06:39] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[6:06:42] <+vaderxyz1970> We all saw
[6:07:08] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[6:07:10] <iamnotaparrot> has Samus spoken yet? she spoke constantly in other M and a bit at the end of fusion.
[6:07:32] <Darren716> The opening text was from her perspective, that's it so far
[6:07:33] <+thelovingfool> only in the starting text
[6:07:38] <Blank9> not unless you count the unspoken narration at the start
[6:07:42] <+vaderxyz1970> She has sofar just screamed in rage
[6:07:48] <Shwepie> @iamnotaparrot Not yet, but later...
[6:07:52] <Saltmeisterr> no thank god
[6:07:55] <tangowulf> Ooooh, Samus has levelled up since I checked in last
[6:08:00] <Saltmeisterr> @iamnotaparrot SHUSH
[6:08:09] <bippityjones> No spoilers in chat
[6:08:14] <RyTYoung> Samus is now going places
[6:08:20] <Blank9> gotta trust speed boost, no holding back
[6:08:26] <Darren716> How is asking if she spoke a spoiler?
[6:08:31] <Asuterisuku> Doing the cool thing is a good way of overcomplicating it.
[6:08:33] <Darren716> It's a legit question after Other M
[6:08:46] <Asuterisuku> Samus has been quiet to this point.
[6:08:50] <hassanico2> Pretty sure she hasn't said anything yet
[6:08:55] <hassanico2> ADAM has done the talking
[6:08:55] <Saltmeisterr> @Darren716 no not you some spoiled something
[6:08:55] <+extradopeness> the answer is no
[6:08:59] <bippityjones> Because it opens up to answers lile "not yet"
[6:09:00] <Prevot> new area
[6:09:02] <kinkade_77> grapple is the only meh upgrade in the game for me
[6:09:15] <+vaderxyz1970> I want someone to edit in elevator music in this

[6:10:00] <Saltmeisterr> ok but wheres phedrana drifts tho

[6:10:53] <Darren716> I wonder if that's on purpose
[6:10:58] <jinking79> this damn  saw
[6:10:59] <Asuterisuku> I got this item the first time around. Not this way though.
[6:11:00] <FuqBoiSlim> no bomb jumps for you
[6:11:01] <KetsuoTaberu> that's really good
[6:11:02] <+vaderxyz1970> that has to be on purpose
[6:11:05] <iamnotaparrot> anyone notice the areas have benefits named in alphabetical order so far? Altaria, Burenia, Cataris, etc.
[6:11:13] <+extradopeness> devs trolling
[6:11:20] <dukenux> this whole move has such an exploit feel
[6:11:22] <DXLelouch24> flash step Woolz
[6:11:27] <%Deft_Thought> You can't zero shift into a wall jump, right?
[6:11:28] <Saltmeisterr> @iamnotaparrot oh ur right
[6:11:29] <neraren> IT IS gettable without the bombjump
[6:11:30] <vstpnv> you just got aridash woolie
[6:11:31] <mothdude> Oh wow I didn't realize the alphabetical thing
[6:11:36] <thackattack00> the order is wrong tho
[6:11:42] <%FenixSeraph> just time it right, Vinny managed to do it
[6:11:44] <+SilverDevilfish> Cataris is the 2nd area
[6:11:45] <thackattack00> it goes a > c > b
[6:11:59] <Asuterisuku> Hah, the saw got popped up by the bomb.
[6:12:00] <greatspaceadventure> you can use phase shift there
[6:12:04] <%Prevot> woolie gonna die from this shit
[6:12:06] <spawnzie> and they put the healing statuion right there
[6:12:06] <Saltmeisterr> u have flash shift tho woolie
[6:12:07] <neraren> Its not trolling if its saying "Dont do it that way"
[6:12:12] <Asuterisuku> @thackattack00 It's not in order of visiting, it's in order of maximum depth.
[6:12:12] <Kaji04> oh? the morph bomb kicks the saw up
[6:12:13] <%FenixSeraph> you just need to time it and be in the right place
[6:12:13] <greatspaceadventure> there's a walljump + phase shift cheese that you can get height with
[6:12:20] <%FenixSeraph> Vinny did it with a tiny bit of luck earlier today
[6:12:20] <thackattack00> thats dumb
[6:12:29] <+kaisbizzare> kaisbizzare subscribed with Prime. 
[6:12:32] <%Dr00_PhD> they put the healing thing there knowing people would keep doing it

[6:15:37] <+ProNooblet> i got here a few hours ago. i damn near cried. 15 years for this continuation
[6:15:39] <AngryAsian5> SEBULBA
[6:15:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> Metroids are a big problem
[6:15:41] <Daxalog> Theyre has never been a lame/bad Bird Alien. Always good.
[6:15:47] <+extradopeness> SEBULBA
[6:15:47] <Asuterisuku> Samus DID destroy the planet later, by the way.
[6:15:49] <dan_g_v> that music sounds like such classic Metroid
[6:15:49] <+D00msDayDan> POWER
[6:15:51] <bippityjones> More Power
[6:15:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HE NEEDS MORE POWER
[6:15:53] <iamnotaparrot> @paranoid_jumbotron almost like the only other game mercury steam made was a remake of 2
[6:15:58] <Darren716> Literal Birgil
[6:15:59] <Inqy833> Ah the old "we'll use the evil weapon of evil to conquer the universe" gambit. Gets em every time.
[6:16:00] <%FenixSeraph> this cutscene is really great
[6:16:03] <Rain_Mage> HE NEEDS MORE POWER
[6:16:04] <+DatAsuna> Good thing caputirng metroids never went bad for anyone
[6:16:10] <brachydios777> MORE POWER
[6:16:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's BY LAW you have to have Red-Soil in every metroid game
[6:16:18] <%MelBrooksKA> Complete world saturation
[6:16:22] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @iamnotaparrot ehh fusion kinda sets it up too with the x
[6:16:31] <+vaderxyz1970> These birds are really throaty in there pronouceiation
[6:16:31] <dukenux> meanwhile Samus just looks at the bird alien, forgot to turn her translator on
[6:16:38] <reonome> man this lore dump
[6:16:40] <+BeatsWithKev> @Daxalog That and bird cyborgs; Storm Eagle is still dope af
[6:16:40] <AngryAsian5> HE NEEDS MORE POWER
[6:16:42] <+thelovingfool> you
[6:16:45] <%FenixSeraph> @BeatsWithKev wait for it
[6:16:45] <Asuterisuku> Raven Beak is VERY MUCH a Vergil.
[6:16:47] <+DatAsuna> The difficulties being that they couldn't EVEN GET ONE
[6:16:49] <%Namillus> @dukenux hold that thought
[6:16:49] <Maids4lyfe> she speaks the language @dukenux
[6:16:49] <jorniev> could really go for some power right now

[6:17:07] <+DatAsuna> Know what woulda helped with the X infiltration? Some metroids
[6:17:07] <@Menitta> Kinda reminds me of the plot in Prime 2
[6:17:13] <Asuterisuku> Yet we haven't seen a single parasite yet.
[6:17:19] <neraren> Im so glad the X are in this, I was worried Fusion would be glossed over
[6:17:27] <dan_g_v> fight more Chozo?
[6:17:28] <Savatewolf> He's so badass he contained them by himself
[6:17:33] <%jinking79> been stopping his plan since 1986 LUL
[6:17:35] <+OniOniOniiii> it was ME?
[6:17:36] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> you just knew retro wanted the luminoth to be chozo but sakamoto probably told them nah

[6:20:46] <redwidow1358> Flash Shift or die
[6:20:48] <Saltmeisterr> yeah thats a POWAH GEYSER
[6:20:49] <Darren716> Keep it simple, shift and doge
[6:20:52] <hollumdusk> @Asuterisuku Good thing we will never heard of this thing again... or anything harder than it!
[6:20:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> woolie look out LUL
[6:20:53] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Shad0wTag
[6:20:58] <%RealThiele> get red smashed
[6:21:00] <essence_of_lariatto> this is the phase shift tutorial
[6:21:24] <AncelDeLambert> blue??
[6:21:25] <Asuterisuku> @Asuterisuku No, nothing of the sort!
[6:21:42] <AncelDeLambert> am I the only one who sees the parry spark as yellow?
[6:21:44] <Asuterisuku> Replies to replies are weird on Twitch.
[6:21:51] <%Namillus> Yeah but the sword blade is blue lol
[6:21:51] <Darren716> Nah the perry is yellow for sure
[6:21:54] <neraren> So Chozo warriors are apparently legit
[6:21:55] <Asuterisuku> No, the parry spark is very yellow.
[6:22:00] <Quinnman89> @AncelDeLambert the blade STAYS BLUE is what he meant
[6:22:02] <vstpnv> @AncelDeLambert parry spark is, attack itself is blue
[6:22:08] <jett_eyes> @AncelDeLambert think he's talking about the blade color
[6:22:11] <Maids4lyfe> @AncelDeLambert nah, I see it as yellow too
[6:22:22] <%Prevot> if chozo warriors are so great why are they all dead
[6:22:25] <TenguOfWind> love the sounds in this game...reminds me of that one movie where they're like trying to reignite the sun
[6:22:26] <afronooch> i see both tbh
[6:22:26] <Asuterisuku> Woolie, look at the map real quick.
[6:22:26] <OfficerMods> the other one is a fake out ground wave projectile
[6:22:27] <+RadioSpirit> I like the implication that Samus is this badass but still only a C-tier chozo warrior.
[6:22:28] <%Namillus> Metroids
[6:22:28] <Shad0wTag> fight the bird person to avenge bird person
[6:22:28] <kinkade_77> so the metroids are dead forever after 2?
[6:22:30] <+extradopeness> yeah its the blue attack not the parry spark
[6:22:39] <Calek> @kinkade_77 Fusion
[6:22:45] <redwidow1358> Yeah, glow means don't touch
[6:22:49] <iamnotaparrot> Is the metroid zero mission Manga still Canon? are her bird dads part of the tribe white robe is from?
[6:22:50] <Shad0wTag> @kinkade_77 pretty much after da baby
[6:22:51] <essence_of_lariatto> fucking power geyser
[6:22:52] <+alphonseisbest> @Prevot metroids?
[6:22:52] <Asuterisuku> You can hover over a boss room to see the boss's name.
[6:22:53] <%RealThiele> yeah the red sword has a huge vertical hitbox
[6:22:54] <TenguGemini> God, the air dash is so good
[6:22:55] <ThatGuyThere03> good trade tho
[6:23:07] <TheCamsan> hits hard af
[6:23:10] <%RyuuAoi> NO LOVR
[6:23:11] <hollumdusk> @RadioSpirit Come on, if Raven Beak is S-Tier, Samus is A-Tier, and getting her buffs.
[6:23:15] <+extradopeness> this fight is hell
[6:23:16] <+vexion_smh> are you feeling the dread woolie
[6:23:19] <+AGood_Noodle> Just beat the game. This is a 10/10
[6:23:29] <@Menitta> playing this makes me wanna replay Prime 1
[6:23:35] <Louie_Salmon> The frame data on their red attack is nuts. Half-screen hitbox, unblockable, variable startup.
[6:23:41] <@Menitta> Might do that before 4
[6:23:48] <iamnotaparrot> day what you will about the boss difficulty, none of these are as poorly designed and slow as Diggernaught from MSR
[6:23:51] <Asuterisuku> You want to flash shift over that red attack.
[6:23:56] <+extradopeness> SHOT
[6:23:57] <thackattack00> He's doing night raid vortex
[6:24:00] <hollumdusk> @Menitta I love Prime, but maaaaan, is going to get some use to go back to it's speed after Dread!
[6:24:01] <Inqy833> Hehe
[6:24:05] <+RadioSpirit> LOL
[6:24:06] <BlackermanZX> nice
[6:24:08] <+vexion_smh> niceeeee
[6:24:08] <+RadioSpirit> also noice
[6:24:09] <Asuterisuku> RIP Bird Dude.

[6:24:22] <redwidow1358> Rest in peace Old Bird
[6:24:22] <%Prevot> RIP lore bird
[6:24:22] <BlackermanZX> rip birb homie
[6:24:24] <jett_eyes> F
[6:24:25] <+AGood_Noodle> Bird down??
[6:24:28] <%Namillus> I love how Samus goes back to Faceless Visor after that fight
[6:24:28] <@Menitta> True but Prime was always much slower paced than the 2D games
[6:24:30] <brachydios777> RIP
[6:24:31] <+extradopeness> He got bopped
[6:24:35] <%Prevot> now back to no chozo
[6:24:37] <Darren716> I mean most of them are dead right?
[6:24:40] <Asuterisuku> They were thought to be extinct.
[6:24:41] <+DatAsuna> They're basically single digits population
[6:24:43] <spawnzie> aside from birdgil that's the first one she's seen in forever
[6:24:47] <@Menitta> its me
[6:24:50] <OfficerMods> After making a galaxy destroying bioweapon they decided to fuck off
[6:24:51] <%FenixSeraph> not extinct, just disappeared
[6:24:53] <%RealThiele> science nerds
[6:24:53] <redwidow1358> Technically zero is a digit
[6:24:55] <Shad0wTag> bird people strong together
[6:25:00] <essence_of_lariatto> gonna make em extinct now
[6:25:04] <%RyTYoung> And he knew Samus without her saying her name
[6:25:04] <@Menitta> chozo are dicks
[6:25:09] <PERCYMaybach> yeah idk why they never thought to help samus or communicate to her
[6:25:10] <PERCYMaybach> ?
[6:25:10] <+RadioSpirit> Doesn't extinct just mean sequel bait in Sci Fi
[6:25:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @officermods "Aight bro imma head out" LUL
[6:25:23] <Blank9> some of them full on ascended past the physical realm
[6:25:25] <+kumaprime> Endangered nomadic chicken man species
[6:25:25] <Inqy833> Ravenbeak doesn't seem exactly bothered by the fact that he's extincting his entire species to take over the universe or whatever.
[6:25:27] <+extradopeness> raven beak selling out his species for a jetpack
[6:25:28] <+DatAsuna> because "everything was done to make you the ultimate bioweapon"
[6:25:29] <Asuterisuku> Yeeeeeah!
[6:25:33] <%RyTYoung> this took me so long to figure out NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[6:25:36] <BlackermanZX> well samus has birb dna so she counts right
[6:25:37] <Blank9> wall jump speed booster
[6:25:44] <FassieFons> critically endangered
[6:25:46] <Onatamana> He also died in one shot
[6:25:51] <NotHereToStream> goddamn birgil
[6:25:55] <+DatAsuna> #NotAllChozo
[6:25:57] <%RealThiele> yea that bird was a chump one shot
[6:25:58] <+kumaprime> He needs more power
[6:25:58] <Darren716> Oh fuck this one
[6:26:00] <+polothegreatest> MOAR POWA
[6:26:00] <+D00msDayDan> a tale as old as time
[6:26:01] <kinkade_77> it begins
[6:26:03] <+OUTheTeam> he's so cool tho
[6:26:04] <Maids4lyfe> Chozo are just like everyone else, some good some bad
[6:26:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> This one is fucking hard
[6:26:06] <+Dudealy> oh lord another one
[6:26:08] <neraren> The speed boost puzzles in this game are SO GOD DAMN HAR
[6:26:08] <Blank9> this is fun
[6:26:09] <BurdRightsActivist> The goblin
[6:26:09] <BlackermanZX> OH this one is a bitch
[6:26:09] <Darren716> yup
[6:26:12] <Asuterisuku> Technically you don't have to drop.
[6:26:13] <mythedge> a tale as old as Vergil
[6:26:13] <+OniOniOniiii> but he's strangely attractive as well, for a Birdman
[6:26:14] <Shad0wTag> I need more bird seed!
[6:26:14] <+DatAsuna> Old Bird was a G
[6:26:16] <+D00msDayDan> i just got this one it's super hard but not as hard as that other one
[6:26:18] <essence_of_lariatto> this one is a lot simpler then it looks
[6:26:19] <%Namillus> It's crazy but it's also sick as fuck
[6:26:21] <+tsamxxx> shinespark time
[6:26:22] <Jaller101514> ballspark practice
[6:26:26] <emMmDeeKay> there are two ways
[6:26:28] <%RyTYoung> go left
[6:26:28] <%RealThiele> time to get good
[6:26:28] <cthulu_fearlock> run from side room?
[6:26:32] <Darren716> Honestly come back wayyyyy later
[6:26:32] <+kumaprime> Some of these puzzles are mean lol
[6:26:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can wall jump while maintaining the speedboost
[6:26:34] <%Deft_Thought> Maybe there's space through the door to the left
[6:26:34] <brunoberserk> so you saying Garibaldo is the last chozo ? LUL Kappa
[6:26:36] <%Namillus> Don't try and ballspark this you have to be grounded for ballspark
[6:26:36] <Blank9> wall jump
[6:26:37] <BlackermanZX> run from the left
[6:26:37] <emMmDeeKay> shine sparking from above or below
[6:26:38] <+D00msDayDan> you can shinespark midair
[6:26:40] <neraren> Its doable nnow
[6:26:41] <Calek> @Darren716 he can do it now
[6:26:44] <Darren716> Because withouth a specific beam this sucks
[6:26:46] <Jaller101514> left room for the speed
[6:26:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:26:47] <+TechnoSyndrome> woolie other rooms exist
[6:26:53] <Savatewolf> I used the fan to speedboost off of
[6:26:58] <spawnzie> shinespark breaks whit blokcs
[6:27:02] <emMmDeeKay> that's too far away
[6:27:02] <BlackermanZX> you can maintain speedboost while wall jumping
[6:27:06] <valriot> You can boost wall jump
[6:27:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can wall jump while maintaining the speedboost
[6:27:14] <redwidow1358> You have to wall jump here
[6:27:15] <+shootbang_exe> hint for woolie: try walljumping during speedboost
[6:27:19] <Asuterisuku> There's another way into this room that makes it much easier.
[6:27:23] <pi_in_the_sci> check the next room for space
[6:27:24] <BlackermanZX> dont store spark right away
[6:27:28] <spawnzie> walljumps maintain speed boost
[6:27:32] <%paladinstarbuster> Samus is so fucking cool
[6:27:39] <Shwepie> @Darren716 You don't need to shoot the blocks at all. Boost kills beam blocks.
[6:27:39] <valriot> you can wall jump, slide and even ball while boosting
[6:27:53] <+shootbang_exe> YEAH
[6:27:55] <Blank9> it's easy
[6:27:58] <neraren> easier coming in from the other room tbh
[6:28:00] <%RyTYoung> yo
[6:28:07] <Darren716> When I did it I came from the other direction I think
[6:28:09] <+thelovingfool> just go into the the charge
[6:28:12] <%Prevot> bruh
[6:28:14] <emMmDeeKay> it's easier if you do it from above there woole
[6:28:20] <Blank9> this is super easy from above, spark can go diagonal
[6:28:25] <Inqy833> So close
[6:28:25] <Asuterisuku> No need to bomb through it.
[6:28:30] <Asuterisuku> Remember, the Spark is eight way.
[6:28:35] <emMmDeeKay> you missed it
[6:28:39] <BlackermanZX> so close
[6:28:39] <Bananassassin> Just did the Kraid quick kill, that's so friggin' dope
[6:28:42] <%jinking79> yes
[6:28:42] <+OUTheTeam> slide down wall is easiest
[6:28:43] <emMmDeeKay> you have to unfurl
[6:28:43] <%KetsuoTaberu> so close
[6:28:44] <pi_in_the_sci> yeah you can
[6:28:46] <Darren716> Just spark when youre a ball
[6:28:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gotta uncurl while falling
[6:28:51] <mothdude> I think hitting L2 in the air will bring you out of ball
[6:28:52] <%mitchteck> Ya y+b
[6:28:56] <Quinnman89> man, i hate this game cause the backseating is too strong. at the fault of nobody
[6:29:08] <neraren> Hes gg it
[6:29:10] <Asuterisuku> He's got it.
[6:29:10] <spawnzie> you got it
[6:29:12] <Blank9> ayyy
[6:29:17] <Inqy833> Yay!
[6:29:18] <+teddybomber> yeee
[6:29:20] <+TechnoSyndrome> sick
[6:29:20] <Magick_Man> Clean
[6:29:21] <@Menitta> boom
[6:29:23] <%RyTYoung> nice
[6:29:24] <iamnotaparrot> YOOOOO
[6:29:24] <Asuterisuku> That is MUCH easier coming in from the other room.
[6:29:25] <OfficerMods> its the exact same feeling of doing an anime fighter combo but in a single player adventure game
[6:29:27] <emMmDeeKay> there we go!
[6:29:27] <TenguGemini> Wait, you can carry speed booster off wall jumps?!?!???
[6:29:29] <redwidow1358> This shit is fucking crazy and I love it
[6:29:30] <+kumaprime> good shit Woolie
[6:29:30] <%athuramn> wp
[6:29:33] <%Akizea> that was SO fucking sick
[6:29:34] <%KetsuoTaberu> Ayyyy
[6:29:39] <+tsamxxx> metroid dread is so good I cant take it
[6:29:39] <kikoeru_san> never doubt Woolie, chat
[6:29:41] <%jinking79> faster than Max
[6:29:43] <+polothegreatest> PokPikachu
[6:29:45] <+ViewtifulYoshi> Awesome job!
[6:29:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> I did not know you could do diagonal downwards. I bombed, uncurled, and did it sideways
[6:29:47] <%Prevot> man they really went for it with the shinespark in this game
[6:29:50] <Inqy833> We;; they're not alive and well for very long
[6:29:51] <neraren> At least 2 of them
[6:29:56] <Darren716> Eh "well" is a bit of a stretch
[6:30:01] <%Dr00_PhD> I wouldn't consider it WELL but alive sure
[6:30:03] <Cal_ixo> God Wool spark
[6:30:04] <spawnzie> well we've seen two so "alive and well" light a lot
[6:30:09] <neraren> Well, 1 now
[6:30:13] <Maids4lyfe> had a crew, they're all x parasites now I guess
[6:30:14] <MmmokayByron> And now most are zombified
[6:30:15] <Asuterisuku> But Quiet Robe said all his soldiers were infected by X, so where are they?
[6:30:15] <AncelDeLambert> weren't the Chozo supposed to have all ascended to another plane of existence?
[6:30:15] <TenguGemini> No, they said his crew got taken out by the x didn't they?
[6:30:16] <Inqy833> I mean they all seem to die soon after Samus meets them
[6:30:21] <Darren716> Yo Adam check out this shit
[6:30:25] <spawnzie> they all X now
[6:30:35] <Asuterisuku> "Thoha?"
[6:30:35] <Maids4lyfe> X is just The Thing isn't it
[6:30:37] <%Prevot> yo Adam did you see that sick shit
[6:30:46] <neraren> Thoha is his tribe
[6:30:49] <+extradopeness> x IS just the thing yes
[6:30:51] <greatspaceadventure> you know? color me overly optimistic but i feel like Dread bodes well for the franchise as a whole and we can expect at least as much from Prime 4
[6:30:51] <+RadioSpirit> Doubt
[6:30:52] <+SilverDevilfish> Raven Beak translates to Birdgil in Chozo Kappa
[6:30:54] <+PA_august> Chozo on the dolo
[6:30:54] <reonome> thats convenient
[6:30:56] <AncelDeLambert> Quiet Robe a bro
[6:30:56] <spawnzie> the last metroid is NOT in captivity the galaxy is FUCKED
[6:31:00] <%RyTYoung> What a good guy
[6:31:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Game mechanic defeated
[6:31:11] <%KetsuoTaberu> Quiet Bro
[6:31:12] <BurdRightsActivist> :)
[6:31:15] <+OniOniOniiii> my shit remains rocked
[6:31:33] <DontChuckle98> Bird Marauder
[6:31:34] <Inqy833> Open route to the surface. I'm sure absolutely nothing will go wrong while we follow that route.
[6:31:34] <mothdude> Yeah if you went back in that EMMI room you can see the purple one frozen and jump on it
[6:32:00] <Asuterisuku> I wish they removed more of the fog in the Emmi zones when they were defeated.
[6:32:12] <Asuterisuku> The world design is so cool and that feels like a missed opportunity.
[6:32:13] <Hammatime8> Woolie, why is the latest Gon in 60 Seconds so good?
[6:33:44] <greatspaceadventure> @Asuterisuku duuude so true
[6:33:56] <Rudeboy14> 24 hour stream?! majinoDrip
[6:33:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:34:15] <@Menitta> I keep forgetting you can just jump with the morph ball
[6:34:21] <+extradopeness> nearly 100 missles ayy
[6:34:24] <%mitchteck> Man did twitch add auto censoring
[6:34:37] <mothdude> They got got
[6:34:41] <reonome> they ded
[6:34:42] <Darren716> I feel she knows sadly
[6:34:46] <neraren> It was pretty clear under all that suit too
[6:34:46] <+thelovingfool> shes all buisness
[6:34:48] <OfficerMods> Samus's number 1 defining character trait is being laser focused on getting the job done
[6:34:51] <+RadioSpirit> I want chozo sage samus
[6:34:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> and what? learn race lore? no sir
[6:34:53] <%Prevot> what happen to our cousin berdly
[6:34:55] <+extradopeness> im sure he doesnt know much more than she would
[6:34:56] <%Deft_Thought> Samus gotta have those Master Chief moments, except good
[6:34:56] <Saltmeisterr> why did she leave the chozo anyway?
[6:34:58] <OfficerMods> she wastes zero time
[6:35:11] <Asuterisuku> She didn't, they dropped her off with the Federation.
[6:35:12] <jorniev> IM still losing my shit at how she totally talked and it was cool
[6:35:17] <TenguOfWind> "I'm sorry Samus, but for the sake of the status quo I must die."
[6:35:17] <greatspaceadventure> @OfficerMods it's why they can never keep up with her, she is like stupidly hell bent on getting her mission over with
[6:35:27] <essence_of_lariatto> I thought the chozo were killed by ridley and the space pirates?
[6:35:34] <Darren716> The secrete to having Samus talk is to have her speak in a language that isn't real
[6:35:39] <BurdRightsActivist> @essence_of_lariatto Most of them, yes
[6:35:48] <BurdRightsActivist> Mother Brain sold em out
[6:35:50] <greatspaceadventure> @Darren716 who knew
[6:35:54] <Monkeyweed21> @Saltmeisterr she lived with the chozo on Zebes, then the space pirates attacked and made it their new homeworld
[6:36:09] <essence_of_lariatto> pretty impressive for a brain in a jar
[6:36:19] <greatspaceadventure> it's not too inconceivable many of them went into hiding, especially now that we know they're such different tribes
[6:36:20] <jorniev> was mother brain part metroid or just a freaky alien?
[6:36:26] <Darren716> Wait so Samus's families got fucked up by space pirates twice?
[6:36:29] <Asuterisuku> There are never secrets in the transporter rooms.
[6:36:30] <fairore> @BurdRightsActivist i dont why but this sentence is really funny
[6:36:31] <Calek> mother brain is a biological computer
[6:36:32] <iamnotaparrot> the enemies hit like trucks in this game. I hope you can get an absurd amount of e tanks like in fusion. you could get like 20
[6:36:40] <+T4silly> Fastball.
[6:36:45] <OfficerMods> three times if you count the steam bots on skytown
[6:36:59] <greatspaceadventure> this game goes hardest in its boss fights tbh
[6:37:04] <Asuterisuku> @iamnotaparrot Fifteen is the maximum if you include the one you get from amiibo.
[6:37:10] <Darren716> I mean she wasnt living on Elysium at least
[6:37:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @iamnotaparrot Tanks and missile were cut down to about 1/2
[6:37:14] <essence_of_lariatto> wait it's from an amiibo?
[6:37:15] <Shad0wTag> avenge bird people by killing bird person
[6:37:18] <NotHereToStream> they knocked it out of the park
[6:37:21] <essence_of_lariatto> no wonder I still have space for one
[6:37:33] <BurdRightsActivist> @BurdRightsActivist It is lol. She controls the metroids and sold em out because evil ai preservation
[6:37:33] <+Ricky_Rexx> God I wish I could afford this game till then I'll just watch the shit out of every stream of it
[6:37:37] <OfficerMods> the elysium people are as chozo as she is though
[6:37:38] <spawnzie> hell yeah
[6:37:42] <KnivesEve> 3d?
[6:37:43] <+ViewtifulYoshi> Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it!
[6:37:50] <+T4silly> still 2D...
[6:37:52] <%FenixSeraph> I like that though, I think it fleshes out some of the gameplay depth
[6:37:53] <greatspaceadventure> imma 'gree
[6:37:54] <emMmDeeKay> unironically  the best metroid game
[6:38:04] <+extradopeness> yeah i dislike not having use of the dpad
[6:38:05] <plainsongz> great sequel to fusion
[6:38:06] <Asuterisuku> Open axis 2D is still 2D.
[6:38:10] <Brand_M1_AK> 2.5D?
[6:38:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Is that really your only issue cause that's honestly pretty minor
[6:38:12] <+TrueWarriorJak> d-pad would only limit it
[6:38:14] <greatspaceadventure> @emMmDeeKay can definitely say this is true from a pure gameplay standpoint
[6:38:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> you guys know what he means by 3D
[6:38:20] <Gelphaze> Looks good, feels good, plays good story's good.
[6:38:21] <Darren716> Did Woolie get the part by the fan?
[6:38:25] <+alphonseisbest> yea MS really did just come out here and make the fuckin BEST Metroid game
[6:38:27] <DevilHands_> It would have been nice to have a Dpad option for this game
[6:38:30] <emMmDeeKay> And it was made by people that RUINED Castlevania
[6:38:30] <jorniev> like the only thing i would say yes to the critics is the remap of buttons
[6:38:37] <+extradopeness> but with the free aim being what it is i understand why it has to be this way
[6:38:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> so prime 4 is gonna go back to first person like the other 3 primes right?
[6:38:53] <%Prevot> the people who ruined castlevania were konami
[6:38:53] <Darren716> I'd have to imagine so
[6:38:53] <Asuterisuku> Konami ruined castlevania, Lords of Shadow was but a symptom.
[6:38:59] <jorniev> god i hope prime 4 is twin sticks
[6:39:03] <+FuqBoiSlim> yeah they really went from lords of ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢shadowsü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ to this
[6:39:08] <Asuterisuku> And also alright games.
[6:39:13] <Shwepie> @jorniev  You can remap at the system level.
[6:39:41] <+alphonseisbest> @Asuterisuku after SR on 3ds and this, u may be onto something there
[6:39:46] <+extradopeness> was that monkey ball
[6:39:46] <jorniev> tehn why are people butt mad? is it too complex to remap?
[6:39:50] <emMmDeeKay> Prime 4 only had Other M as a "bar" to overcome now they have to beat THIS
[6:39:51] <Shad0wTag> Konami wishes they could revive Castlevania like this
[6:39:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> saw some news article that konami was doing something new for each of their big ips and it just kinda seemed like wishful thinking unless it was true
[6:40:00] <emMmDeeKay> They're fucked
[6:40:17] <+vexion_smh> man I can't believe we are living in a time where metroid 5 and prime 4 both exist now
[6:40:19] <%Prevot> personally I don't have a lot of faith in Prime 4 so I'm glad this game is amazing
[6:40:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> damn imagine owning castlevania, silent hill, and metal gear and just wasting all of that
[6:40:27] <Shad0wTag> @ricky_rexx We'll believe when we see it, they seem as uninterested in developing games more than ever
[6:40:27] <Asuterisuku> Prime 4 doesn't exist.
[6:40:31] <Asuterisuku> Not until we see gameplay.
[6:40:31] <+T4silly> Use the Bombs.
[6:40:32] <OfficerMods> after playing prime 3 i have a good idea of what prime game can play like with better hardware
[6:40:37] <+extradopeness> the succ
[6:40:43] <thackattack00> treat every "konami is reviving x franchise" rumor as a lie until we see a trailer
[6:40:45] <OfficerMods> its really clear that gunship was meant to be used more than as a teleport and key
[6:41:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:41:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Shad0wTag thats exactly why I saw the title and thought "oh really? they're actually doing something? press x to doubt"
[6:41:01] <iamnotaparrot> God what if prime 4 forces you to use joycon motion controls tho???
[6:41:12] <Shad0wTag> who seriously believes konami still want make games
[6:41:17] <%Prevot> I WANT to use gyro aiming
[6:41:25] <%Irridium> sbfpDattebayo
[6:41:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Shad0wTag hopeful fans, sad and hopeful fans
[6:41:28] <+T4silly> Sussy Bakas?
[6:41:28] <%Prevot> wiimote was the superior Prime control method
[6:41:29] <fairore> honestly i dont need prime 4 after this
[6:41:29] <neraren> Who wants their sussy corners bombed
[6:41:29] <Asuterisuku> I worry about the gyro aiming though; the infrared pointer on the Wii was nice.
[6:41:29] <Shad0wTag> when their last attempt was MGS Survive
[6:41:30] <+RadioSpirit> If Nintendo wanted to come out with a new motion peripheral, Prime 4 would probably the the way they'd do it
[6:41:31] <freddiefreeloader_> LUL
[6:41:31] <+T4silly> oh... nvm
[6:41:32] <+extradopeness> i like gyro aiming too tbh
[6:41:36] <DedlokPM> teenSHAKE SUSSY BAKA
[6:41:36] <TheHardM> Sussy Aran
[6:41:38] <spawnzie> switch does have pretty good gyro aiming
[6:41:39] <MegaApple18> LUL LUL
[6:41:40] <dan_g_v> susy baka corner
[6:41:41] <bootysteve> Woolie's played Bullets Per Minute right
[6:41:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> I just wanna know when prime trilogy on switch
[6:41:53] <+RadioSpirit> @bootysteve god I hope so
[6:41:53] <Asuterisuku> @bootysteve He wasn't very good at it.
[6:42:01] <bootysteve> I tried it today that game fucks
[6:42:08] <jorniev> how come adam hast authorized you when to use your powers
[6:42:12] <jorniev> ?
[6:42:14] <+TrueWarriorJak> Samus Returns needs to ported
[6:42:16] <Shad0wTag> @radiospirit Nintendo Switch Arm Cannon on sale and scalped
[6:42:18] <roughday25> asset reuse is the best shit in the industry
[6:42:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> put samus returns on the switch 2 do it you won't nintendo
[6:42:23] <roughday25> just look at megaman
[6:42:26] <OfficerMods> scatch?
[6:42:26] <DoctorMulholland> WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
[6:42:26] <Cal_ixo> This is the last one
[6:42:30] <iamnotaparrot> gyro aim like splatoon is cool. using the detached joycons like a wiimote and nunchuk is the monkey paw scenario I'm imagining
[6:42:30] <Monkeyweed21> they can, but will they?
[6:42:31] <Blank9> it can be done, they--
[6:42:32] <Shad0wTag> @bootysteve yes
[6:42:32] <+RadioSpirit> I really want to see this engine used to remake Zelda 2
[6:42:32] <AncelDeLambert> I have no clue how anything in the future could top this, tho
[6:42:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SFM too Kappa
[6:42:34] <Explodincatz> lol same can be said for every previous system
[6:42:35] <+T4silly> Sell me a new piece of Map as DLC. I'll fucking buy it.
[6:42:36] <Darren716> I wonder if they ported prime trilogy they'd use the wii controls for all 3, or they'd give prime 3 standard controls
[6:42:36] <+Ricky_Rexx> imagine just getting metroid games?
[6:42:40] <Davybot> Returns on Switch would absolutely bang
[6:42:53] <+Bearborg> you CAN see the direction of grapple blocks on the map
[6:42:53] <Asuterisuku> They wouldn't give Prime 3 standard controls.
[6:42:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> hasn't this game already sold super well?
[6:42:58] <%Prevot> @ricky_rexx that's crazy
[6:42:59] <+DatAsuna> But hopefully prime 4 is also good
[6:43:01] <+shootbang_exe> I think it's already the best selling metroid
[6:43:01] <+DatAsuna> and we get both
[6:43:04] <+alphonseisbest> its selling well
[6:43:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[6:43:09] <Darren716> I can easily imagine this being the best selling metroid game
[6:43:11] <%Prevot> LUL
[6:43:12] <+T4silly> FUCKOTAKU
[6:43:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> we need that SR port. literally all my problems with it come from the fact it's a 3ds game
[6:43:13] <+alphonseisbest> SIX Million cpoies
[6:43:13] <redwidow1358> Man that Kotaku shit was so annoying today
[6:43:14] <@Menitta> oh god that kotaku article is dogshit
[6:43:15] <Shwepie> Kotaku is so dumb sometimes.
[6:43:17] <jorniev> it already sold super well
[6:43:17] <%Prevot> fucking kotaku
[6:43:18] <emMmDeeKay> No need to make it for PC and DOWNSCALE IT like Mirror of Fucking Fate
[6:43:21] <redwidow1358> I was hoping you saw that Woolie
[6:43:25] <Darren716> Since most of the other ones haven't sold much more than a mil
[6:43:26] <OfficerMods> i think return needs a switch port using this engine, as it stands right now the reccomend play order is a fan game
[6:43:29] <+polothegreatest> ihear this game cant save progress LUL
[6:43:30] <emMmDeeKay> But it emulates well tho...
[6:43:30] <Shad0wTag> Chat what did Kotaku do this time
[6:43:30] <OfficerMods> a really really good fan game
[6:43:32] <+extradopeness> kotaku dot com spewing garbage? imagine that!
[6:43:34] <OfficerMods> but still
[6:43:35] <%jinking79> god kotaku really tey to fuck Metroid sales LUL
[6:43:39] <redwidow1358> I had to debate some idiots on Twitter about how "well they didn't explicitly say to pirate the game"
[6:43:49] <+Ricky_Rexx> I just wish I could afford it, queue 2d games shouldn't cost $60 joke
[6:43:55] <Asuterisuku> That's sus.
[6:43:56] <%Prevot> imagine waiting 2 decades for a sequel and a major gaming outlet goes "yo you can pirate this shit super easy guys"
[6:44:00] <RubeTheRogue> BUT WOOLIE Nintendo really do that? No matter how successful they are, Nintendo insists on spurning success for 'innovation'.
[6:44:02] <jorniev> the biggest problem is the title of that article
[6:44:08] <@Menitta> They put an article that basically said "yo the game on emulators is dope thank god for that"
[6:44:08] <BurdRightsActivist> BABY??
[6:44:09] <jorniev> that shit is on porpuse
[6:44:14] <churropoppa> You need to dump your game to be able to emulate it so you still need to buy a copy of it regerdless
[6:44:24] <+vexion_smh> secret secrets
[6:44:27] <+DatAsuna> They didn't say that
[6:44:29] <redwidow1358> You need a copy of the game to emulate it *legally*
[6:44:30] <Asuterisuku> You should open that block below you before going up.
[6:44:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> Waiting for Kotaku to publish a step by step guide to emulating this game
[6:44:31] <emMmDeeKay> Kotaku deliberately went for a hateclick article and y'all fell for it
[6:44:34] <Shad0wTag> @menitta If Nintendo doesn't blacklist them for that holy shit
[6:44:36] <+DatAsuna> They said it can be emulated and that's a problem for nintendo
[6:44:38] <neraren> 2 missile upgrades feel so negligible but 10s feel so good
[6:44:46] <Blank9> I didn't read the article though
[6:44:50] <redwidow1358> But they had to edit in the part that says "at least buy it before you pirate"
[6:44:50] <Blank9> or click it
[6:44:53] <+polothegreatest> dont pirate BibleThump , this game takes decades if sold bad
[6:44:59] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> that is a thing
[6:45:00] <Shad0wTag> @datasuna kotaku can emulate these nuts
[6:45:08] <%Dr00_PhD> they don't get the hateclicks if i see the whole article through twitter screenshots
[6:45:09] <+polothegreatest> just look fzero BibleThump
[6:45:16] <Asuterisuku> It just splatted against the wall.
[6:45:19] <+DatAsuna> Maybe don't get mad at the imaginary version of the article
[6:45:23] <%Irridium> Game's #1 on the eShop and most online retailers, I think it'll be just fine.
[6:45:35] <jorniev> she really likes hitting enemies with that weapon doesnt she?
[6:45:37] <redwidow1358> What imaginary version?
[6:45:47] <+DatAsuna> I literally just read the article lol
[6:45:50] <%Prevot> hey guys Kotaku is already looking great when browsed with an adblock
[6:45:50] <fairore> god fzero needs a remake so bad
[6:45:51] <Asuterisuku> Friendship with Flash Shift ended, Shinespark is my new best friend
[6:45:57] <iamnotaparrot> seeing this game sell and be popular by just being a good normal game is making Starfox Zero hurt so much more. starfox and fzero fans stay depressed
[6:46:03] <neraren> You can grapple those guys to pull their lasers off
[6:46:05] <+DatAsuna> Their tone is concern rather than encouragement
[6:46:06] <redwidow1358> Yeah they had to edit several parts @datasuna
[6:46:17] <+FuqBoiSlim> honestly though Dread is #1 on damn near every list. People pirating isnt gonna put the franchise to sleep. This isn't an indie game. Article is still ass though
[6:46:30] <%Dr00_PhD> purple is energy red is ammo yellow is both
[6:46:33] <dan_g_v> acid octopus boss incoming?
[6:46:41] <Savatewolf> Oh no Samus and tentacles WutFace
[6:46:47] <@Menitta> Bringing attention to it at all is a problem from every angle.
[6:46:52] <@Menitta> Regardless of their tone.
[6:46:57] <spawnzie> just to be cool
[6:46:58] <%athuramn> LUL
[6:47:10] <Asuterisuku> Aren't missiles great for swarms?
[6:47:14] <+DatAsuna> Sure, but strawmanning is a problem in itself
[6:47:22] <%barkon345> So dose this game take place on a giant space station?
[6:47:28] <iamnotaparrot> those little black swarms look just like the little dudes from prime 1
[6:47:28] <OfficerMods> no on a planet
[6:47:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> Nintendo can't do anything to yuzu and ryuinx. Emulation itself isn't a crime or anything.
[6:47:38] <OfficerMods> with an underground ocean i think
[6:47:49] <redwidow1358> Before edits, there was a passage that said "It's a Switch exclusive, as you might expect. But all you need to play Dread is a decently powerful PC and the emulator."
[6:47:54] <neraren> the grapple beam is such a letdown that it doesnt preserve momentum the way you think it should
[6:48:06] <+TheIndigoLlama> with the movement tech in this game I feel like a style meter would sit pretty nicely as like a separate mode or something
[6:48:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[6:48:12] <redwidow1358> There is no strawman, they literally removed the part that encouraged piracy and then said oopsie we didn't mean it
[6:48:20] <%RealThiele> penor door
[6:48:22] <Asuterisuku> Oh yeah THIS boss!
[6:48:25] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[6:48:30] <reonome> monkaS
[6:48:31] <Monkeyweed21> oh no
[6:48:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> yeah that sentence is kinda sus (impostor)
[6:48:33] <+cubbywolf> thankfully woollie is here to save me from thanksgiving
[6:48:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> This boss is a bastard
[6:48:34] <%Deft_Thought> Ewwww
[6:48:35] <%RyTYoung> yup
[6:48:37] <roughday25> oh man this one took me a hot second
[6:48:38] <Darren716> This one can be a bitch
[6:48:38] <Maids4lyfe> this one is easy you got this
[6:48:40] <+T4silly> Why can't Metroid Swim.
[6:48:41] <%FenixSeraph> oh it's THIS one
[6:48:41] <+extradopeness> this boss OWNS
[6:48:42] <Saltmeisterr> thats a butthole
[6:48:42] <AncelDeLambert> this one took me forever just because I was too stupid to find the gimmick
[6:48:42] <thackattack00> it took me so many tries to figure out the gimmick here
[6:48:45] <%RealThiele> will he figure out the mechanic
[6:48:47] <DXLelouch24> this boss is a joke
[6:48:52] <DXLelouch24> i wrecked him on hard
[6:48:55] <dan_g_v> sphincter
[6:48:55] <%king_wragles> Is Woolie nailing every parry?
[6:48:57] <neraren> Puzzle boss check, huge damage output check, underwater so limited movement options check
[6:48:58] <Asuterisuku> This one's a puzzle boss. It's easy when you know what to do.
[6:49:04] <Asuterisuku> Figure out what to do, Woolie.
[6:49:16] <AncelDeLambert> dammit, he figured it out
[6:49:31] <mothdude> Wow he got it instantly
[6:49:33] <%RealThiele> 50% figured out
[6:49:37] <Darren716> So who else didnt see the button?
[6:49:37] <roughday25> you got it way quicker than I did, good job
[6:49:46] <AncelDeLambert> dude, it took me like five tries to notice the pump next to the starting position
[6:49:46] <%Dr00_PhD> It took me like 2 deaths to figure it out
[6:49:51] <Asuterisuku> It took me a ouple of attempts.
[6:49:56] <essence_of_lariatto> it took me way to long to figure this out

[6:50:13] <AncelDeLambert> He's as dumb as us!
[6:50:14] <+thelovingfool> theres 2 buddy
[6:50:15] <+T4silly> Missiles are actually slower on those switch things... I think.
[6:50:18] <%RealThiele> LUL
[6:50:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh no sbfpSetIn
[6:50:22] <+extradopeness> I saw it and actually ignored iy
[6:50:23] <GenmaKido> let mans figure it out lmao
[6:50:26] <Asuterisuku> One charge shot will activate it instantly.
[6:50:30] <fairore> @AncelDeLambert lmao

[6:50:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie you have to hit them
[6:50:51] <neraren> Good learning for a first attempt tho
[6:50:59] <%RealThiele> much data gained
[6:50:59] <neraren> Took me 3 times to learn the same stuff
[6:51:08] <NotHereToStream> woolie just downloading, no biggie
[6:51:11] <Jaller101514> !uptime
[6:51:12] <@Moobot> @Jaller101514 WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 7 hours and 2 minutes
[6:51:24] <+thelovingfool> a perfect run of this takes like 54 seconds
[6:51:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> Download Complete?! PogChamp
[6:51:32] <Asuterisuku> We're in there.
[6:51:33] <+Ricky_Rexx> I go for the bathroom for a sec and come back to this thing wtf
[6:51:37] <+liftedlegend7> how difficult is this game??
[6:51:41] <pi_in_the_sci> boss parry
[6:51:42] <Asuterisuku> Ooh, that was parryable.
[6:51:43] <redwidow1358> It's pretty hard ngl
[6:51:44] <+T4silly> Hit the dingle dangle for maximum damage!
[6:51:45] <thackattack00> fairly tough
[6:51:50] <spawnzie> dont miss that parry
[6:51:53] <OfficerMods> harder than most metroids eaiser than most castlevanias
[6:52:01] <+polothegreatest> zelda boss SirShield SirPrise SirSword
[6:52:02] <Asuterisuku> @liftedlegend7 Harder than fusion, but also more forgiving in that difficulty.
[6:52:04] <Jaller101514> 7 HOURS? damn woolie goes hard when solo
[6:52:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Huh I've seen this animation b4 Kappa
[6:52:10] <pi_in_the_sci> PARRY
[6:52:10] <+FuqBoiSlim> the bosses can beat your ass but exploration itself is pretty smoove
[6:52:12] <+thelovingfool> can counter
[6:52:14] <iamnotaparrot> hardest 2d metroid other than than the OG
[6:52:17] <greatspaceadventure> @OfficerMods lmao that is startlingly accurate
[6:52:19] <+HakureiIllusion> That's a parry flash
[6:52:20] <Maids4lyfe> parry tentacle
[6:52:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> geez wish I could stream for that long
[6:52:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> NOOO
[6:52:28] <+Ricky_Rexx> wait Samus is a girl?
[6:52:38] <+Ricky_Rexx> joke
[6:52:38] <%Dr00_PhD> are you meming?
[6:52:39] <fairore> dont backseat guys
[6:52:42] <+0dinpen> this game looks like its worth getting a switch for
[6:52:56] <neraren> I dont think he sees us
[6:52:59] <+PA_august> Metroid is a girl and she‚Äôs married to Halo
[6:53:11] <+extradopeness> the scream sounds like phantoon
[6:53:13] <iamnotaparrot> and doomguy is their son
[6:53:13] <+Ricky_Rexx> @PA_august Don't forget their son Doom
[6:53:21] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder who did the VA for samus
[6:53:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> wait why is doomguy the son he's older than halo
[6:53:32] <Savatewolf> Samus Metroid and John Halo
[6:53:34] <greatspaceadventure> @0dinpen it alone maybe not but the switch's general selection of exclusives yes
[6:53:43] <iamnotaparrot> because doomguy is smol
[6:53:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> pretty sure he's like 10 feet tall but ok
[6:54:00] <Maids4lyfe> NotLikeThis
[6:54:04] <%Dr00_PhD> He sees it
[6:54:06] <+Ricky_Rexx> probably not but he just feels that tall
[6:54:07] <+extradopeness> John (Demons) Doomguy
[6:54:11] <iamnotaparrot> nah he's a manlet.
[6:54:15] <Shwepie> @greatspaceadventure Not just the exclusives, a lot of the ports from the Wii U are really good too.
[6:54:24] <neraren> And game
[6:54:28] <+Ricky_Rexx> just put all the metroids on switch already
[6:54:29] <%Irridium> @greatspaceadventure wen's Devo;
[6:54:32] <reginault> hentai defeated!
[6:54:35] <Asuterisuku> Didn't see the parry animation, sadboys.
[6:54:35] <+FuqBoiSlim> ah gottem ggs
[6:54:37] <%AkumaXDemon> AkumaXDemon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! hey there
[6:54:37] <fairore> welp
[6:54:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> even that shitty ones I don't care
[6:54:46] <+thelovingfool> ah no counter animation, oh well its not super flashy
[6:54:48] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie REFUSES to actually parry a boss
[6:54:48] <%Dr00_PhD> Back to youtube for the parry cutscene
[6:54:56] <%Deft_Thought> And Samus said, "Huh. All right."
[6:55:00] <%Irridium> @greatspaceadventure Devil's Third* it would have been funnier if I didn't fuck up typing lol
[6:55:00] <AdrianBauer> hentai Calcified
[6:55:01] <+extradopeness> the christian minecraft server is saved
[6:55:01] <NotHereToStream> doesn't matter, artist will use this as perversion of canon
[6:55:03] <+cubbywolf> cool
[6:55:04] <+Ricky_Rexx> like that close up on samus's emotion
[6:55:04] <+alphonseisbest> but it is always time for henti
[6:55:05] <reonome> LUL
[6:55:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IT ALWAYS COMES BACK WOOLIE
[6:55:07] <Onatamana> congratulations you killed the giant barnacle
[6:55:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:55:07] <+DatAsuna> Probably the most weirdly understated boss death in the game
[6:55:07] <Savatewolf> Later but not today
[6:55:09] <%mitchteck> No parry :(
[6:55:09] <%Prevot> LUL
[6:55:10] <%FenixSeraph> woolieYE
[6:55:10] <iamnotaparrot> how the hell did they not manage to port fusion to the switch before this came out?
[6:55:11] <Davybot> lmfao
[6:55:12] <%RealThiele> tomorrow maybe
[6:55:12] <+Slattsquatch> This is the one boss I never actually saw a parry animation for
[6:55:13] <+Rasheedt> yovgBird
[6:55:17] <Monkeyweed21> this one isnt that fancy
[6:55:20] <+HakureiIllusion> You can check boss names in the Mission Log
[6:55:21] <Darren716> Woolie is gambling by looking up this game LUL
[6:55:21] <+T4silly> NO YOULL GET SPOILED
[6:55:22] <afronooch> risky google
[6:55:22] <Asuterisuku> You can get the boss's name by hovering over the icon on the map!
[6:55:27] <+Bearborg> boss name is drogyga
[6:55:29] <%jinking79> woolieMIRIN
[6:55:31] <neraren> Says the bosses name on the map room
[6:55:33] <MaesePC> no parry no party!
[6:55:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> do you think it's more instictual to dodge or parry?
[6:55:48] <%RealThiele> Drogyga is a word thats for sure
[6:55:50] <Jaller101514> the faded boss icon on the map tells you what the name is
[6:55:50] <DXLelouch24> its nothing fancy
[6:55:53] <redwidow1358> You can see the boss name by looking at the room on your map, move the cursor like a millimeter
[6:55:54] <DXLelouch24> i did it today
[6:55:57] <Shad0wTag> AVENGE BIRD PERSONS
[6:55:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's not that great
[6:55:59] <DXLelouch24> he just dies faster
[6:56:00] <Monkeyweed21> this one isnt as fancy as Kraid
[6:56:02] <+DatAsuna> meh, this boss is the least cool in the game
[6:56:05] <+cubbywolf> next time?
[6:56:06] <fairore> dont worry some bosses will actually force it out of you
[6:56:16] <+DatAsuna> you've got cooler stuff in every other fight
[6:56:19] <DXLelouch24> hard mode lp confirmed i guess
[6:56:20] <redwidow1358> That boss was neat, but also pretty weird ngl
[6:56:33] <neraren> Its a puzzle boss, eh
[6:56:43] <+Slattsquatch> The boss is just spore spawn 2.0
[6:56:55] <BurdRightsActivist> Gotta say,  I was iffy about the game's visuals but it looks fine on portable mode
[6:56:55] <Maids4lyfe> wet spawn
[6:56:55] <iamnotaparrot> better than Diggernaught
[6:57:03] <neraren> theres a path up where you are
[6:57:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Diggernaut's the best
[6:57:04] <Maids4lyfe> moist spawn
[6:57:08] <+Slattsquatch> I'm pretty sure people have also found a way to skip it completely just like that boss
[6:57:23] <Asuterisuku> You cannot yet.
[6:57:39] <+BerryValkyrie> too fat
[6:57:46] <Maids4lyfe> need gravity suit
[6:57:52] <cthulu_fearlock> boing
[6:57:54] <Asuterisuku> IBJ doesn't work in water.
[6:57:59] <roughday25> think you're gonna need a sexier suit for that jump
[6:58:05] <+extradopeness> gotta get that tine stop
[6:58:19] <+extradopeness> time*
[6:58:24] <Darren716> You got a save right up ahead
[6:58:56] <Darren716> LUL
[6:59:02] <sniffy77> Wow woolie is still streaming after seven hours. Must be a really good game
[6:59:04] <neraren> lm glad hes learned the secret tech of always go straight for the second grapple point
[6:59:10] <redwidow1358> Get noob bridged
[6:59:36] <+D00msDayDan> i'm playing along, just a few seconds behind woolie
[6:59:39] <%RealThiele> woolie can dab on pat tomorrow now for his baby progress
[6:59:40] <+DatAsuna> good first session
[6:59:43] <Asuterisuku> This is a big game.
[6:59:47] <+extradopeness> gavin?
[6:59:51] <Darren716> How far did Pat end up getting?
[6:59:51] <+DatAsuna> @RealThiele how far did pat go? lol
[6:59:58] <%RealThiele> pat stopped at flash step
[7:00:02] <+DatAsuna> rip
[7:00:05] <redwidow1358> I hope Woolie doesn't beat the entire game in one sitting because I still haven't started the final fight
[7:00:16] <Asuterisuku> Sunlight in the forest thooooough!
[7:00:16] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie is WAY ahead of Pat, now
[7:00:24] <Gelphaze> Killer plants!
[7:00:25] <neraren> Final fight is Rough, all Ill say
[7:00:33] <+HakureiIllusion> It's hard but it's fun as hell
[7:00:34] <spawnzie> petting a dog is just parrying really slowly
[7:00:35] <DXLelouch24> Crazy Talk cause Woolie to surpass Pat
[7:00:38] <TheHardM> Streaming video games ain't a race unless it is.
[7:00:39] <hollumdusk> Is he planning to finish in one sitting?!
[7:00:53] <AncelDeLambert> if he does, he'll be here another five hours
[7:00:53] <fairore> @redwidow1358 better get started then budy Kappa
[7:00:55] <Parapattern> Samus just goes around pulping the heads of animals with her arm canon
[7:00:56] <redwidow1358> Woolie are you going for the end tonight?
[7:01:04] <Asuterisuku> No going back now.
[7:01:08] <Darren716> He didnt say anything about one sitting, he's just going at his own pace
[7:01:12] <redwidow1358> @fairore I still have to do cleanup and get all the items because I want the special unlock
[7:01:16] <thackattack00> he just said he was only going a little further chat LUL
[7:01:25] <DXLelouch24> apparently his own pace is fast as fuck
[7:01:39] <redwidow1358> I honestly didn't hear that, I was being yelled at from across the house lol
[7:01:42] <AncelDeLambert> fuckin HAX
[7:01:42] <%RyTYoung> is Woolie gonna do his first death stream? gigaboOtsBaniShock
[7:01:47] <AncelDeLambert> shenanigans!
[7:01:48] <Asuterisuku> IBJ is so good.
[7:01:50] <Gelphaze> That tree just ate that deer!
[7:01:51] <neraren> I also dunno why if he learns a timing doesnt he learn the fast timing for bomb jumps
[7:01:55] <iamnotaparrot> CHEAT
[7:02:06] <DXLelouch24> @Gelphaze thats no tree hehe
[7:02:22] <Maids4lyfe> plant vore
[7:02:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[7:02:25] <spawnzie> nature poppin off
[7:02:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Damn nature you scary
[7:02:33] <Asuterisuku> Oh no another one.
[7:02:33] <%RealThiele> get stickbugged
[7:02:36] <DXLelouch24> HES BACK
[7:02:39] <Saltmeisterr> oh no a robit
[7:02:43] <Asuterisuku> This guy fucked me up for a while.
[7:02:46] <+PA_august> Discover these bugs then murder them
[7:02:50] <NotHereToStream> movement in this game is buttery smooth damn
[7:02:51] <%RealThiele> i died to this one way too much
[7:02:55] <+T4silly> These fights are like when you fight Julius in Aria. They're so awesome.
[7:03:00] <+turtlelord42> That dash attack is absurd
[7:03:27] <%Prevot> oh shit
[7:03:33] <Asuterisuku> Slow your missiles a little bit; taking more than one in a short amount of time cancels the damage.
[7:03:33] <thackattack00> cross-up parry
[7:03:34] <+gridib> The air dash makes this fight so much easier, but I completely forgot I had it
[7:03:35] <greatspaceadventure> @T4silly oh my god you are so right
[7:03:39] <Savatewolf> The Red Dash is absurd in a later fight
[7:03:47] <iamnotaparrot> flash step and parry are just trickster and royal guard
[7:04:04] <Dio_TR> YOOOO 8 hour stream lets gooo
[7:04:05] <reginault> Clap
[7:04:11] <neraren> EZClap
[7:04:15] <%thedankestmeeme> rest andf rip
[7:04:19] <+turtlelord42> this game fuckin rocks
[7:04:19] <spawnzie> though the power of trickster and royal guard
[7:04:19] <AncelDeLambert> amazing how many missiles the game gives you, because after a certain point you will NEVER need that many
[7:04:20] <ohno778> gg ez scrub get rekt
[7:04:23] <+OUTheTeam> clap
[7:04:37] <%thedankestmeeme> he shoulda goittem gud
[7:04:38] <+extradopeness> you crushed it man
[7:04:44] <+cubbywolf> animals!
[7:05:14] <Asuterisuku> Emmis have been deactivated, remember?
[7:05:19] <neraren> Its fine
[7:05:21] <reonome> Kappa
[7:05:27] <Asuterisuku> Oh look there it is.
[7:05:30] <+vaderxyz1970> Yah totally
[7:05:35] <DXLelouch24> forever right?
[7:05:36] <spawnzie> he sleep
[7:05:37] <roughday25> taking metroid just a click or two in the Character Action direction was a great idea
[7:05:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yup they're beaten forever Kappa
[7:05:49] <+extradopeness> no problem
[7:05:55] <WillofGame> Press X to doubt
[7:05:58] <Davybot> oh wtf how did i miss seeing bird friend
[7:06:01] <+extradopeness> DarkMode
[7:06:01] <Darren716> EMMI put in the forever box
[7:06:07] <iamnotaparrot> yo do the animals that pilot your ship at the end of fusion show up in the intro when you're on the ship? I missed the start
[7:06:12] <fairore> @Davybot yeah
[7:06:13] <GarbageNirvana> Just stopping in, I assume from the uptime that Woolie enjoys the game
[7:06:24] <+alphonseisbest> did ADAM call samus Lady in fusion?
[7:06:28] <saddlezilla1> Man, why do Chozo always gotta chose planets w/ fucked up natural wildlife to settle?
[7:06:30] <+vaderxyz1970> When have underground forrests ever been a good thing
[7:06:35] <+DatAsuna> @alphonseisbest yes
[7:06:36] <+extradopeness> yea @alphonseisbest
[7:06:37] <TheHardM> @alphonseisbest Yes. At the end.
[7:06:41] <Asuterisuku> ADAM talking mad shit.
[7:06:42] <+cubbywolf> cool adam
[7:06:42] <%Prevot> talk shit adam
[7:06:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIRDGIL
[7:06:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HES MOTIVATED
[7:06:48] <AngryAsian5> "You ain't shit." - Adam LUL
[7:06:49] <SirDogBear> Your power level not high enough BibleThump
[7:06:50] <DeeVee_TV> raven beaks' dick is huge ive seen it
[7:06:50] <DXLelouch24> ACCEPT YOUR HELPLESSNESS
[7:06:51] <Savatewolf> Raven Beak has a huge dick Samus
[7:06:53] <%RealThiele> worthy
[7:06:55] <Parapattern> Just hit him while your doing a shine spark and turn him into paste
[7:06:56] <$mattynezz> Adam is a bitch in this game
[7:06:58] <spawnzie> what MOTIVATED him
[7:06:59] <%Dr00_PhD> Motivated you say
[7:07:08] <OldManDeckardCain> how about going further beyond tho? Kappa
[7:07:09] <brachydios777> MOTIVATION you say?
[7:07:11] <$mattynezz> It's actually a nice touch
[7:07:13] <%jinking79> Raven Beak a 9-1 matchup Samus LUL
[7:07:13] <ohno778> Berdgil
[7:07:20] <%FenixSeraph> Adam: Birdgil is so much stronger and sexier than you Samus
[7:07:36] <+0dinpen> birdgil too strong a name
[7:07:39] <iamnotaparrot> Birdgil's got the biggest cloaca. You can't compare, samus
[7:07:42] <+Slattsquatch> Evillak?
[7:07:44] <%Prevot> Adam: I wish I was in Raven Beak's ship
[7:08:00] <+cubbywolf> raven beak would let me go to the party
[7:08:00] <Darren716> He has hp like a whale too
[7:08:06] <TheHardM> ADAM: You stand no chance against Birdgil, Samus. He is a man, after all.
[7:08:06] <Asuterisuku> Woolie has no chill.
[7:08:13] <%RealThiele> poison whale
[7:08:14] <spawnzie> filter feeding with radiation
[7:08:14] <Biggredd87> THE BABY
[7:08:16] <Explodincatz> the Baby
[7:08:17] <Gelphaze> Creepy
[7:08:17] <+vaderxyz1970> Congrats you killed a collosus
[7:08:19] <+T4silly> TA BABEE
[7:08:19] <iamnotaparrot> THE BABY
[7:08:20] <@Menitta> The Baby
[7:08:22] <+extradopeness> üê≥ BabyRage
[7:08:24] <spawnzie> baby's cry
[7:08:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> Baby??
[7:08:33] <saddlezilla1> Those are apparently not hostile if u don't attack them.
[7:08:38] <ohno778> da baby
[7:08:38] <+T4silly> *AND* the X.
[7:08:40] <%mitchteck> The baby
[7:08:41] <+Emperor_Machinus> Now she truly is MEtroid
[7:08:44] <emMmDeeKay> Adam always underestimates Samus. He only has HIMpathy
[7:08:46] <+DatAsuna> I hate that you're right
[7:08:48] <spawnzie> she's like some kind of METROID FUSION
[7:08:49] <Darren716> Should I even say THAT podcast title?
[7:08:55] <@Menitta> Is this reminiscent of Prometheus
[7:08:57] <+0dinpen> who wore it first
[7:08:58] <+T4silly> She's got 2 sets of DNA right in there.
[7:08:58] <SirDogBear> she got all the genes PogChamp
[7:08:59] <+cubbywolf> why would you remind me of that movie
[7:09:04] <jorniev> ARYAN?
[7:09:07] <Darren716> Yup
[7:09:07] <saddlezilla1> Well she just kinda "EATS" the X. They aren't part of her.
[7:09:07] <mothdude> It's true but you shouldn't say it
[7:09:08] <ohno778> stop being right woolie
[7:09:11] <+cubbywolf> damn you for being right
[7:09:12] <%jinking79> but she's not a clone
[7:09:12] <brachydios777> Samus is Metroid
[7:09:12] <+alphonseisbest> @emMmDeeKay ah, u too enjoy the Mrfeels take on things LUL
[7:09:16] <TheHardM> Here's a secret; Metroid has ALWAYS been Alien.
[7:09:23] <%RealThiele> samus can ace basketball now
[7:09:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[7:09:27] <Darren716> I forgot that was the source of that title until I re listened to that podcast
[7:09:36] <spawnzie> me metorid me no like cold
[7:09:37] <+vaderxyz1970> You think at this point samus would become a chimera or sumthing with all the DNA shes got
[7:09:37] <+DatAsuna> @TheHardM what? no ridley who??
[7:09:38] <neraren> you can go there a little
[7:09:45] <+T4silly> take a dip in the cold
[7:09:45] <@Menitta> It kinda is like Prometheus isnt it....
[7:09:54] <Saltmeisterr> wait did woolie get sups yet?
[7:09:56] <TheHardM> @TheHardM Sorry, his name is Kraid Scott.
[7:09:57] <emMmDeeKay> @alphonseisbest he truly is a man of culture
[7:10:03] <+alphonseisbest> indeed
[7:10:09] <hollumdusk> @Menitta Metroid came with Prometheus plot, before Ridley Scot!
[7:10:11] <Darren716> Much like Claire, Samus forgot her parka
[7:10:11] <spawnzie> she was give it to you right befor ridley showed up
[7:10:15] <Asuterisuku> That particular E Part is fun to get.
[7:10:21] <@Menitta> No this game
[7:10:23] <%Prevot> I bet Kraid Scott could make a new Alien movie that doesn't suck
[7:10:33] <+Bearborg> i literally never took this elevator and beat the entire game without ever going that way
[7:10:34] <+Parrish_broadnax> Adam said scarfs are against protocol
[7:10:42] <@Menitta> Because Fusion is like Resurrection
[7:10:49] <thackattack00> "thah-moose"
[7:10:49] <Monkeyweed21> SEBULBA
[7:10:56] <+SilverDevilfish> I heard him say "in the 80s"
[7:10:58] <iamnotaparrot> Adam hasn't authorized you to put on your sweater yet
[7:11:00] <hootletheowl> He also pronounced Samus like Samuth
[7:11:07] <BurdRightsActivist> KRAZOA PALACE
[7:11:11] <saddlezilla1> Raven Beak is "Ashkar Behek" in Chozo.
[7:11:13] <spawnzie> he also says Samus Aran like it's one word
[7:11:14] <Darren716> Some nerd is gonna use that dialogue and reverse translate Chozo
[7:11:16] <neraren> I am really curious what speedrunners do with the pathing, because it seemed really linear in my runthrough but I know theyll do some shit
[7:11:21] <%Prevot> don't make fun of his accent, he ain't got no lips
[7:11:35] <+0dinpen> za bebe
[7:11:38] <Asuterisuku> Quiet Robe deserved better.
[7:11:42] <brachydios777> @prevot How does he make m noises?
[7:11:52] <TheHardM> @brachydios777 Very carefully.
[7:11:54] <%RyTYoung> @neraren they spam flash drive as much as possible
[7:11:57] <Gelphaze> he did say SEbulba
[7:11:59] <@Menitta> Eyyy
[7:12:00] <%FenixSeraph> woolieYE
[7:12:01] <spawnzie> YAY
[7:12:04] <Asuterisuku> Fusion style Super Missiles; they stack on top of your old ones!
[7:12:05] <jorniev> SUPER
[7:12:07] <+extradopeness> supa
[7:12:07] <jorniev> HOT
[7:12:10] <Explodincatz> 7 hours in get super
[7:12:10] <brachydios777> Neat
[7:12:12] <+DatAsuna> remember, that's R
[7:12:13] <neraren> straight up upgrade
[7:12:15] <+DatAsuna> not the other R
[7:12:18] <spawnzie> straight upgrade, fusion style
[7:12:20] <DoctorMulholland> They just replace the regular missile here, like in Fusion.
[7:12:22] <iamnotaparrot> any% speedrun Wr Is roughly 2:00 right now. lot of skipping and sequence breaking
[7:12:23] <%Indigo_909> Indigo_909 subscribed with Prime. 
[7:12:27] <+HakureiIllusion> Fusion-style Super Missiles, just a clear upgrade, that's the way to go
[7:12:31] <+polothegreatest> Big girl missiles psaGoblin
[7:12:41] <fairore> @iamnotaparrot sick
[7:12:41] <%MrMoonGoose> So badass
[7:12:44] <essence_of_lariatto> super metroids super missiles were too broken
[7:13:05] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[7:13:14] <%Prevot> it was also really annoying having to switch between the two
[7:13:32] <Shwepie> I prefer that Super Missiles are something separate and do a billion damage, but what they end up doing with missiles in this game is an okay replacement.
[7:13:39] <+alphonseisbest> RE3:REMAKE tongue shit outta here
[7:13:44] <Kaji04> what's the latest upgrade he's got so far?
[7:13:50] <neraren> So does this game have the Crystal Flash?
[7:13:52] <WillofGame> Do you think Samus gets dizzy after going through one of those tubes?
[7:13:52] <iamnotaparrot> super missile
[7:13:53] <TheHardM> @Kaji04 Just got Super Missile.
[7:13:59] <essence_of_lariatto> I do like being able to hold r and just mash like hell
[7:14:01] <iamnotaparrot> like 1 minute ago
[7:14:06] <brachydios777> @willofgame Super missle
[7:14:07] <jorniev> DID anyone see the kraid morph ball kill?
[7:14:16] <%Dr00_PhD> yeah looks sick
[7:14:16] <thackattack00> yeah shit's sick
[7:14:20] <GarettLefebvre> burning tree?
[7:14:21] <codyppp1> dang still going? must be really good. I never tried a metroid game. I did play the 2014 stryder game .
[7:14:23] <Darren716> Yeah, it's rad
[7:14:23] <Kaji04> hell yeah
[7:14:26] <Asuterisuku> I missed that on my playthrough.
[7:14:36] <Asuterisuku> But I saw how it can be done coming back to the room.

[7:14:55] <%Pyretech> Pyretech subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[7:14:57] <+extradopeness> this game DOES feel like strider 2014 in some ways
[7:15:02] <iamnotaparrot> and xray
[7:15:03] <saddlezilla1> @Shwepie same, i like missiles being the dependable sppammy ones, & Super's being something to be more careful with.
[7:15:07] <Asuterisuku> Woolie, you may want to put chat to emote only for this.
[7:15:14] <%Dr00_PhD> I love me some strider 2014
[7:15:25] <Darren716> Nah chat's being behaved

[7:30:58] <%Prevot> both are almost unkillable
[7:30:59] <BlueSpartan119> that's fair
[7:31:02] <Gelphaze> Wait what happens if these thing get out Woolie
[7:31:02] <shillelaghrod> that is fair
[7:31:02] <DSD24> Get your rest Woolie
[7:31:03] <+thelovingfool> fair
[7:31:04] <XuriScratch> you can just put the switch in sleep mode
[7:31:05] <KnivesEve> no worries

[7:31:07] <dreamfillah> Fair
[7:31:07] <TongYueliang> Please sleep
[7:31:08] <Qsmash_> you could just stop it here if you want
[7:31:09] <%xeros720> oh yeah, i'm not sure there's a save here
[7:31:09] <%neraren> Suspend it hear?
[7:31:09] <Shwepie> Attempt the boss once?
[7:31:09] <+MisterAvry> let the man sleep
[7:31:09] <saddlezilla1> get some rest wools
[7:31:10] <$pixelkenj> not far if you just reload next time
[7:31:11] <AncelDeLambert> you've been at this for eight hours, it's fine to cease
[7:31:11] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> All you need to do is lose 5 mins of progress
[7:31:11] <Asuterisuku> Which is why we said before entering was a good stopping point.
[7:31:11] <+OUTheTeam> sadly trapped
[7:31:12] <iamnotaparrot> suspend mode. home button
[7:31:12] <SirDogBear> tired, yet the game is so good PogChamp

[7:31:14] <%RealThiele> suspend game
[7:31:14] <+Felhad> !uptime
[7:31:15] <@Moobot> @Felhad WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 7 hours and 42 minutes
[7:31:15] <roughday25> I remember this being an easy boss, but if you're beat then don't push it
[7:31:19] <+thelovingfool> could just throw it on sleep
[7:31:20] <+silvery_cricket> Go to sleep Woolie beat it later
[7:31:20] <+Extrallent> it's been almost 8 hours. makes sense
[7:31:22] <psidefx> sleep tho
[7:31:22] <+DatAsuna> I did say it would be fine to start on that next time. xD
[7:31:24] <saddlezilla1> you could just quit and restart
[7:31:24] <+alphonseisbest> BEAT BOSS TO SLEEP
[7:31:30] <BlackermanZX> almost 8 hours deep and this game still amazing
[7:31:30] <spawnzie> we have trapped you >:)
[7:31:32] <+DatAsuna> But yeah just sleep moding the switch is probably the play
[7:31:32] <redwidow1358> You could also just reload tomorrow, it's a very short part of the game honestly
[7:31:34] <AncelDeLambert> oh shit, he got to the X while I wasn't looking
[7:31:37] <+silvery_cricket> You have already done an already full 8 hour work day punch out

[7:32:59] <Asuterisuku> That's not a parry, Woolie.
[7:33:00] <+DatAsuna> This is maybe my favourite boss
[7:33:01] <pi_in_the_sci> no parry there
[7:33:03] <reonome> no flash woolie

[7:33:59] <Monkeyweed21> THAT NUMBER IS A LIE
[7:34:02] <+extradopeness> lmao thanks tho woolie that was awesome
[7:34:04] <Saltmeisterr> thx for the stream Wools

[7:34:13] <%FenixSeraph> thanks for the stream Woolie
[7:34:14] <SgtPepper5e> good shit woolie thanks for the long stream
[7:34:18] <hollumdusk> Great stream, glad I catch it!
[7:34:18] <Darren716> That number is just pure gameplay, doesnt count deaths or pause time
[7:34:19] <Gelphaze> Time to rest woolie big day tomorrow.
[7:34:20] <DXLelouch24> back to Maxs VoD
[7:34:22] <reginault> syncy baka
[7:34:23] <%Indigo_909> I'm glad I showed up before leaving, even got the time to finally sub to you. Big fan for a long time lol
[7:34:25] <Asuterisuku> The number doesn't include any time you don't have full control of Samus.
[7:34:29] <Shad0wTag> what a god damn stream
[7:34:35] <mothdude> SUPER HOT
[7:34:35] <Knight_Anastasia> Woolie Vs Sleep
[7:34:35] <@Menitta> Very good stream
[7:34:40] <KnivesEve> so... Samus is Back
[7:34:45] <pi_in_the_sci> You got way father then Pat
[7:34:48] <@Menitta> Its much better than SR
[7:34:48] <OldManDeckardCain> pat thought he'd be able to spoil you LUL
[7:34:49] <spawnzie> good ass Troid
[7:34:54] <+extradopeness> best game of 2021?
[7:34:57] <+gridib> It's a damn good metroid game
[7:34:59] <redwidow1358> Pat got like a baby step or three in by comparison
[7:35:04] <Asuterisuku> It has the potential to be my favourite video game period.
[7:35:09] <shillelaghrod> @DXLelouch24 Not really near the end but the IGT doesn't count pause time or repeat boss attempts. So when you reload after a death it only counts the success
[7:35:11] <cthulu_fearlock> got further then pay boi
[7:35:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> You've almost beat the tutorial
[7:35:16] <greatspaceadventure> this game overwrites all of Other M's big mistakes
[7:35:16] <kentrix11> It's by far the best metroid when you consider the rest of the game.
[7:35:17] <Obake_Radio> sup :3
[7:35:22] <+DatAsuna> For me, it does
[7:35:25] <+D00msDayDan> Can‚Äôt wait to see the speedruns
[7:35:26] <greatspaceadventure> yeah it's fucking great
[7:35:26] <+vaderxyz1970> I cant believe people be reviewing this game poorly
[7:35:28] <+silvery_cricket> You dont need to play off the stream go to bed you are tired
[7:35:32] <DXLelouch24> its my favorite 2D Metroid by far your in for a treat
[7:35:37] <SirDogBear> is it gunning for the Super throne? PogChamp
[7:35:39] <+OUTheTeam> real glad this got uncanceled
[7:35:41] <+DatAsuna> The extra bit at the end of zero mission kinda dragged it down for me lol
[7:35:48] <DXLelouch24> @SirDogBear it dethroned it imo
[7:35:49] <Asuterisuku> "And then it's gone" LUL
[7:35:52] <+DatAsuna> And then Other M did the same thing even worse
[7:36:07] <+silvery_cricket> Take a nap
[7:36:08] <roughday25> this game ended up Max-ACTing my expectations
[7:36:11] <hollumdusk> The ZM Flashbacks and Fusion's Japanese endings too.
[7:36:11] <redwidow1358> Dread handles Chozo super good
[7:36:11] <spawnzie> samus talked it made me happy WHICH IS CRAZY
[7:36:15] <+DatAsuna> The mangas are fun but weird
[7:36:15] <+extradopeness> X-Chozo > SA-X
[7:36:16] <%RealThiele> Chozo, maybe not good guys
[7:36:18] <AncelDeLambert> for some good reason, the Prime games make it clear the Chozo have like ascended
[7:36:27] <+DatAsuna> Samus threatens to shoot adam in the face at one point
[7:36:28] <slatersev> Some Chozo
[7:36:30] <+silvery_cricket> You gotta go to sleep man, you dont gotta play off the stream its okay to stop
[7:36:32] <SirDogBear> Woah @DXLelouch24  I guess Samus wants to attack and dethrone God PogChamp
[7:36:42] <AncelDeLambert> Samus moves good, she looks good, she SOUNDS good
[7:36:42] <%Prevot> super walljump sucked ass
[7:36:45] <slatersev> Diffirent Tribes did different things
[7:36:47] <Saltmeisterr> you can actual do single wall wall jumps
[7:36:51] <%FenixSeraph> üëã
[7:36:52] <Shad0wTag> @anceldelambert ascended?
[7:36:53] <Saltmeisterr> but its dummy hard
[7:36:57] <AncelDeLambert> this game makes up for Other M in every way
[7:37:04] <Govoni> How could we forget the baby
[7:37:13] <AncelDeLambert> @Shad0wTag as in became pure energy
[7:37:15] <+DatAsuna> she deserves it
[7:37:18] <%RealThiele> Sequels underway
[7:37:27] <Saltmeisterr> it broke the 3 mil curse
[7:37:31] <Govoni> ITS THE BABY
[7:37:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[7:37:36] <hollumdusk> It's also the highest rated Spanish game in History now. Good for Mercury.
[7:37:37] <@Menitta> It's really not hard for Dread to be the best selling Metroid Game
[7:37:49] <%RealThiele> beeg
[7:37:50] <%Prevot> considering the last release was Federation Force, good sales are NOT a given
[7:37:53] <Saltmeisterr> @hollumdusk oh damn thats sick
[7:37:58] <%jinking79> right next to Nick all stars LUL
[7:37:59] <%RealThiele> oh jesus fed force
[7:38:03] <AncelDeLambert> Dread is easily the best 2D Metroid game, hands down
[7:38:06] <%Irridium> Oh god I forgot about Federation Force
[7:38:07] <@Menitta> Samus Returns tho
[7:38:14] <Shad0wTag> @anceldelambert oh shit so they just left the universe?
[7:38:17] <tangowulf> No Metroid game has sold more than 3 million. I think Dread might break that limit, just because the switch is popular
[7:38:20] <zeekayart> happy sunday ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[7:38:22] <Saltmeisterr> cmon guys don't you like BLAST BALL
[7:38:25] <Kaji04> Will it blend
[7:38:30] <AncelDeLambert> @Shad0wTag something like, it's been a long time since I played the Primes
[7:38:31] <%Prevot> oh yeah forgot SR was after
[7:38:47] <Kaji04> It's Easy hard
[7:38:48] <@Menitta> its not hard
[7:38:50] <AncelDeLambert> this game has rough spots, without a doubt
[7:38:51] <+T4silly> Just today I got reminded that Federation Force is actually a Metroid PRIME game...
[7:38:51] <hollumdusk> @tangowulf Not to mentions streams like this one. Old Metroid games didn't had this level of coverage.
[7:38:53] <BlackermanZX> its not hard at all
[7:38:57] <%RealThiele> yea they did a lot of PR for this game so numbers gotta be more
[7:38:57] <@Menitta> Like even by Metroid's standards its not hard
[7:38:58] <%Prevot> the checkpoints are SUPER forgiving
[7:39:01] <+silvery_cricket> Its a horror game
[7:39:05] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's challenging and that means it's not for journos
[7:39:12] <mothdude> The checkpointing being generous makes it a lot better than you'd think
[7:39:16] <%jinking79> u gotta be real bad at video games to call this hard
[7:39:17] <%Prevot> in old games you actually lost progress
[7:39:18] <+DatAsuna> Fusion is much harder
[7:39:18] <TheSaltminer> Kotaku are so afraid of it they're advertising PIRATING it so Nintendo stop making hard games
[7:39:28] <AncelDeLambert> Nightmare is a nightmare
[7:39:30] <slatersev> Lmao, but Jurnos reviewed it super well
[7:39:36] <@Menitta> It should be an assumption that an EMMI getting to you, you're dead
[7:39:39] <BlackermanZX> kotaku is fucking wack
[7:39:39] <Asuterisuku> That goddamn SPIDER
[7:39:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> That Spider
[7:39:41] <mothdude> The spider? That one was nasty
[7:39:44] <+extradopeness> nightmare was so fucking good
[7:39:47] <%RealThiele> the spider after nightmare for me was obnoxious
[7:39:47] <glass_marcus> You'll die, but you won't suffer.
[7:39:48] <%Prevot> I was playing hard mode Fusion earlier this year and that was fucking bullshit
[7:39:49] <godzookylives> the spider boss in Fusion fucking sucks
[7:39:51] <hollumdusk> Yakuza!
[7:39:59] <+TrevSmith222> I saw people complaining about how you have to hold A to jump higher.
[7:40:00] <+DatAsuna> Y'all up to some dumb conspiracy theories
[7:40:03] <hollumdusk> (Yakuza the Spider Boss, not the game series)
[7:40:04] <DracaenaLeaf> Night!
[7:40:04] <theredfox930000> metroid fusion is the hardest of the series
[7:40:04] <redwidow1358> Fusion spider boss was easy when you learn that morph ball in the left corner leaves you unable to get hurt
[7:40:05] <KnivesEve> laters woolie woolz
[7:40:06] <+extradopeness> yakuza was evil
[7:40:09] <+Mecha_G> Cerris was pretty annoying
[7:40:11] <AncelDeLambert> see ya tomorrow
[7:40:17] <fairore> good stream
[7:40:19] <TheSaltminer> get ready to TURN AROOOOOOOUND
[7:40:21] <hollumdusk> @redwidow1358 Until the Second Phase, that is
[7:40:23] <%Indigo_909> G'nighty night Woolie! o/
[7:40:28] <+Mecha_G> but Nightmare was pretty cool
[7:40:32] <theredfox930000> lazy Sunday atpDance atpDance nzeroDon nzeroDon majinoNinjuh lijoeGod
[7:40:34] <redwidow1358> Second phase is tricky, but I got good at aiming diagonally
[7:40:49] <Shwepie> @TrevSmith222 Seriously? That's not even Video Games 101.
[7:41:00] <Knight_Anastasia> Isn't GN reviewing them?
[7:41:06] <Asuterisuku> Fusion wasn't as hard as far as individual moments though, but it didn't have the checkpoint system so it wasn't as forgiving.
[7:41:13] <hollumdusk> Take care Woolie, have some  rest!
[7:41:28] <%RealThiele> Fusion story when you find out theres fucking 13 SA-X tho was STRONG
[7:41:41] <Hammatime8> Good night, everyone!
[7:41:47] <+OroOreo> Big shot
