[0:06:26] <%ChoculaUltra> it really is tho ngl hahaha
[0:06:41] <$Futurecity10> Dont sweat over it
[0:06:49] <%ChoculaUltra> Jedi Knight (forgot the actual class name) was actually pretty awesome too
[0:07:03] <%Irridium> swtor is fine I just wish it was a proper single-player game. Or, several rather considering all the class stories

[0:07:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Konami literally changed our common vocabulary.
[0:07:58] <%correctedsun117> For real donations
[0:08:02] <+krispen_wa> Square Enix fucking donated
[0:08:08] <Aussie_Manny> By having already been doing good stuff?
[0:08:08] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> lol the realest
[0:08:10] <GarbageNirvana> B&J is the only good brand response

[0:09:50] <DatAsuna> opening the fanny pack
[0:09:51] <%redrins> and they will match employee donations
[0:09:55] <+aishman> Remember, according to a certain right-winger gamer, Sony is a DOUBLE TRAITOR
[0:09:56] <+oda_flobunaga> So, in the same way there was a Ms Monopoly, will there be a BLM Monopoly?
[0:09:58] <%shincadad> Those sets are really fucking expensive

[0:19:52] <+fifty_seven> holy shit its Wilrow Hood
[0:19:54] <%jillpilled> It sadly does, and who wants to look like Carth

[0:19:58] <%jillpilled> no oneeee
[0:19:59] <+Feralspirit41> you mean carths son murderer suit?
[0:20:06] <ThatGuyThere03> This becomes something of a theme in Obsidian games
[0:20:06] <%correctedsun117> Remember, this game was made in 15 hours in a shack
[0:20:14] <DatAsuna> Okay you can leave the cave now, that was it. :P
[0:20:25] <%Gruhunchously> According to Chris Avellone, they spent like half the dev time redesigning the UI and working on Pazaak and Swoop Racing.
[0:20:26] <%BearSawed> $ hours on an atari 3200
[0:20:32] <+Freeborg1997> Lot more Carth in light side route
[0:20:33] <+oda_flobunaga> STAR NIGGLE?
[0:20:43] <lotharrio> You get references to both, if Revan was Light Side and male
[0:20:48] <Pechugaman> Lot more Bastila if you are a male Revan
[0:21:01] <lotharrio> I believe to the point that they have conversations with each other.
[0:21:02] <KaitlynnHere> @oda_flobunaga excuse me?
[0:21:11] <cafeapathy> hold up does that person have 2 lightsabers?
[0:21:16] <abelincoln_catpuncher> just got here, what'd i miss?
[0:21:17] <chll0ne> whatd i miss
[0:21:18] <MarkUriah> 3 handed sith
[0:21:20] <%GrassCannon> Threedon Nadd's Blaster
[0:21:24] <+Freeborg1997> He's in it if Revan was MALE and dark-side. He's only killed if Revan is Female and dark-side.
[0:21:27] <available_line> nothing yet
[0:21:31] <%Gruhunchously> @oda_flobunaga N-Pass is on hold right now.
[0:21:31] <KaitlynnHere> !uptime
[0:21:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 32 minutes and 17 seconds
[0:21:35] <+oda_flobunaga> @KaitlynnHere cause slight but persistant annoyance
[0:21:39] <available_line> Missed (Nothing)
[0:21:45] <cafeapathy> I'm so behind, gotta catch up
[0:21:46] <Joostebrood> Freedon Nadd's Blaster™
[0:21:48] <%BisoromiBear> Vsauce will never choke you...
[0:21:50] <DatAsuna> Game audio seems louder than last stream
[0:21:52] <GHouseduivel> Running a crime syndicate is expensive, you need to make money on merch
[0:21:55] <+oda_flobunaga> a trifling complaint
[0:21:57] <jorniev> for a second i tought revan was standing behind you
[0:22:13] <%ChoculaUltra> the korriban cleaners eh
[0:22:14] <%Gruhunchously> Revan goes to Korriban regardless
[0:22:15] <GHouseduivel> Kreia
[0:22:29] <%BearSawed> I think its mainly because of sound bug dat asune
[0:22:45] <StarlitStunner> Dustil, Carth’s son was supposed to show up on Korriban but it was cut.
[0:22:46] <+SolidusRex> If you play lightside in KotOR 1, you basically slaughter the entire academy besides a few students you redeem to the lightside
[0:22:47] <+Freeborg1997> @GHouseduivel ???
[0:22:47] <subjectg> On the light side revan never goes to korriban after the war and they would’ve killed each other regardless
[0:22:53] <usurper_sos> CRUNCH
[0:22:55] <available_line> Force Storm is jut busted OP
[0:23:00] <$Invlux> World War B
[0:23:04] <GHouseduivel> @Zanco23 He was struggling with who told them who came to clean Korriban
[0:23:08] <lotharrio> I think you mean "Beast World Ies" Woolie.
[0:23:17] <Joostebrood> sound fx out the ass
[0:23:18] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Ow, my ears
[0:23:24] <Joostebrood> it was insanity
[0:23:25] <cafeapathy> im scared of vsauce and force lightning now
[0:23:27] <%Gruhunchously> You can tell that this cave was a repurposed asset from Bioware rather than Obsidian. Because the layout is actually intuitive and makes sense.
[0:23:29] <MarkUriah> Force Bass
[0:23:30] <Joostebrood> as in the force power
[0:23:32] <Space_Pagan> ouch
[0:23:32] <Firststrike_OW> monkaS
[0:23:34] <+Freeborg1997> @StarlitStunner Wouldn't make sense, he either dies or leaves, right?
[0:23:41] <jorniev> geeeeez
[0:23:53] <%Gruhunchously> YOU SHALL NOT PASS
[0:23:54] <jorniev> MASS DEATH
[0:24:05] <available_line> QE boys
[0:24:20] <%RioGascar> I believe that sound was the fear power
[0:24:26] <+Freeborg1997> @Gruhunchously Damn, sick burn LUL
[0:24:26] <%BearSawed> So is he just not going to punch people?
[0:24:38] <available_line> You can almost see the edge of the Event Script box.
[0:24:49] <lotharrio> Regenerate Health isn't terrible.
[0:24:55] <Joostebrood> yes it is
[0:25:00] <therakishsage> Dueling is just generally good.
[0:25:04] <%shincadad> Dueling
[0:25:04] <lotharrio> Aww
[0:25:12] <StarlitStunner> Yup, he wasn’t going to have a big role anyways, he was just going to be a corpse. Carth suffers in every timeline. @zanco23
[0:25:18] <%Gruhunchously> Dueling is useful for punch Jedi
[0:25:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:25:18] <GHouseduivel> Conditioning is never bad
[0:25:24] <+Feralspirit41> Doesnt unarmed count as dual wielding? Cause two fists
[0:25:25] <available_line> Corpse (Carth)?
[0:25:30] <DatAsuna> You're basically a quality build for 3 OP play-styles that conflict
[0:25:41] <GarbageNirvana> Carth (Nothing)
[0:25:43] <GHouseduivel> @AvailableThor Unfortunately no :(
[0:25:56] <%shonen413> shonen413 subscribed at Tier 1.
[0:25:59] <+Freeborg1997> @StarlitStunner :(
[0:26:22] <+Exicuren> wasn't thete a lens or proyectior that gave the lightsaber a small desintegrating damage bonus?
[0:26:22] <GHouseduivel> 14 months man
[0:26:55] <GHouseduivel> Crunch 24/7
[0:26:55] <%emperordread> Obsidian make the best jank
[0:27:01] <+Exicuren> Like small disruptor damage
[0:27:07] <lotharrio> If they... had like... 3 or 4 more planets, and spread some of the allies out among those planets? Might works out.
[0:27:10] <StarlitStunner> At least he has a cool coat, that balances out the suffering...right? stripFear @zanco23
[0:27:15] <prime_name> Andromeda
[0:27:17] <%BisoromiBear> DNF
[0:27:17] <available_line> It's got a pretty big dick.
[0:27:18] <%jillpilled> This and New Vegas deserves the succ
[0:27:19] <usurper_sos> There are way worse game dicks
[0:27:20] <+MidnightBurst12> It's dick deserves it
[0:27:21] <%ShadowArcangel> There are way worse dicks to suck
[0:27:24] <jorniev> and fuck ea again for cancelling that other single player game
[0:27:24] <KaitlynnHere> Suck it dry
[0:27:32] <%Gruhunchously> They had to re-write the script halfway through because LucasArts wouldn't let them play the first game for some reason.
[0:27:38] <tolloponik> anthem
[0:27:44] <%correctedsun117> Give Obsidian the Madden franchise
[0:27:46] <MarkUriah> Give Obsidian a popular franchise to deconstruct and time they can be unstoppable
[0:27:57] <GHouseduivel> Madden got renewed for Exclusivity for like another 6 years :\
[0:28:01] <usurper_sos> Sometimes the KOF dick is just flaccid
[0:28:01] <%correctedsun117> BUT!
[0:28:07] <+Exicuren> Says you, Woolie, kof was always hot here in mexico
[0:28:07] <andrei11dr> Wasn't Anthem like 7 years?
[0:28:08] <chll0ne> sports games are ass
[0:28:13] <KaitlynnHere> @gruhunchously couldn’t they have purchased it and played it on their own?
[0:28:18] <+Feralspirit41> Fallout 76 is the ultimate example of "this game sucks a ton of ass despite being worked on for x amount of time"
[0:28:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> @andrei11dr 10
[0:28:27] <+ktothec99> This game is incredible without the mod... it just has a garbage ending
[0:28:28] <andrei11dr> Shit
[0:28:32] <%Gruhunchously> @KaitlynnHere I'm not sure.
[0:28:33] <chll0ne> my friends are in abusive relationships with 2K
[0:28:37] <available_line> I wonder if some of the modders were actual Obsidian employees.
[0:28:42] <Drunkengen> Man Odsidians must be the fucking masters of getting great games out in a short time because the publishers are fucking awful
[0:28:44] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @andrei11dr they restarted development like 3 times
[0:28:50] <+Exicuren> Anthem was """"""7"""""" years
[0:28:50] <%BearSawed> Madden will never not be renewed because of the metric fuckbucket of money it pulls every year
[0:29:01] <lotharrio> Matukai band isn't bad, I think.
[0:29:05] <chll0ne> they hate playing 2K but continue to play😭
[0:29:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Drunkengen Obsidian often gets fucked by publishers
[0:29:17] <therakishsage> That was a thing with the 'Ascension' mod for Bioware's Baldur's Gate 2. Some of the devs were involved with a mod that was basically the 'Definitive Edition'
[0:29:20] <%alrobot2014> it sure does look like a z fighting texture
[0:29:27] <MarkUriah> We don't talk about Outer Worlds. Sadly forgettable.
[0:29:29] <chll0ne> i feel bad for them cuz its the only decent basketball game
[0:29:29] <%emperordread> Z Fighting? Is it Tien?
[0:29:39] <StarlitStunner> Alpha Protocol is still the best spy game despite being one of Obsidian’s buggiest projects
[0:29:41] <%BearSawed> Its just like all gamers, we bitch and wine but never not give bad devs money
[0:29:43] <%Gruhunchously> @KaitlynnHere All I remember is that they didn't have access to the anything but a plot synopsis of the first game for the first few months of development.
[0:29:46] <andrei11dr> @reverend_roscoe Well, if they were doing a good job/working for someone not evil, then that would've happened
[0:29:49] <available_line> It's just hear distortion.... in a cold cave.
[0:29:49] <+krispen_wa> The Frontloaded Worlds
[0:29:58] <%jillpilled> Outer Worlds was the case of ample dev time, but just what feels like a rushed/not cared for ending. Was unfortunate
[0:30:02] <+Feralspirit41> 1 DAMAGE
[0:30:03] <%wildcard_9000> Do non-gamedevs know what Z-fighting means?
[0:30:03] <%Gruhunchously> Damage 1
[0:30:04] <GHouseduivel> 25m
[0:30:06] <+Feralspirit41> GAME BREAKING GUN
[0:30:08] <%jillpilled> Not a bad game tho
[0:30:16] <+Exicuren> Eh, Outer Worlds is fine, it just came out without catching fire in a time frame when two games were constantly resetting the clock
[0:30:18] <$Invlux> DC22
[0:30:19] <%correctedsun117> Attribute damage?
[0:30:24] <lotharrio> The CON damage means it's WAY more likely to deal a stun.
[0:30:31] <%hzflank> 9 seconds, dc 22 is good
[0:30:39] <subjectg> DC 22 is pretty bad for endgame in kotor though
[0:30:39] <tolloponik> its to catch them when they run
[0:30:41] <+Feralspirit41> Do a playthrough only using that gun
[0:30:42] <%jillpilled> @exicuren that's a good way to look at it yeah
[0:30:48] <KaitlynnHere> @gruhunchously maybe they didn’t have the time to sink into playing it. Maybe they were looking for a full script instead?
[0:30:48] <+kekkerscrew> Attribute damage
[0:30:48] <subjectg> dc 14 is even worse
[0:30:51] <%ShadowArcangel> Feels like a gun made for theme not for gameplay balance if that makes sense
[0:30:52] <%emperordread> Dont give up skeleton
[0:30:58] <snakemuho> 25% with all the multishots is pretty good still
[0:31:05] <lotharrio> You're using that to shoot unarmored slaved in the back as they run, @WoolieVersus
[0:31:07] <+krispen_wa> A WEAKNESS IS REVEALED
[0:31:09] <MarkUriah> @Exicuren Outer worlds was okay when I expected fantastic imo
[0:31:09] <GHouseduivel> Sith Jobbers
[0:31:14] <Joostebrood> oh cool my ears
[0:31:16] <+kekkerscrew> Really good gun
[0:31:20] <therakishsage> It might as well be a 5% chance with how the resistance modifiers on the things you're going to be using it on get.
[0:31:26] <StarlitStunner> The Compliance Regulator and Boxing Tape in Fallout New Vegas, just knock everybody out.
[0:31:28] <therakishsage> The only way it'd work is on a Natural 1.
[0:31:29] <%hzflank> I guess a sneak attack character could do some damage with it
[0:31:33] <subjectg> honestly disregard all things with difficulty class because everything gets above 20 to saves in lategame
[0:31:42] <usurper_sos> Sith corpse (nothing)
[0:31:52] <+krispen_wa> Obsidian made SO MANY armors and weapons in this game that are functionally useless
[0:31:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Let Obsidian do the next Metal Gear
[0:31:59] <jorniev> loook at all these nothings i just made
[0:32:15] <subjectg> that’s an M9 to you woolz
[0:32:37] <%ShadowArcangel> Is it time for one of the best parts of this vide gam?

[0:40:34] <lotharrio> Kavar was planning on a war... but there's no promise he'd be able to push it through.

[0:40:48] <%emperordread> Activate lightsabre
[0:41:03] <therakishsage> Pretty sure Vandar died on Katarr.
[0:41:06] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Vandar went to Katar with everyone else
[0:41:20] <%Gruhunchously> @BallerSwagBro9k In this playthrough? He died in the battle of the Star Forge
[0:41:23] <ingman112> Dark side Revan means vandar died in the star forge battle

[0:47:18] <DatAsuna> yeah sinestro was a fuck
[0:47:21] <+jiggy_snipe> with a name like Sinestro
[0:47:21] <lotharrio> Sinestro is SO GREAT
[0:47:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HIS NAME IS LITERALLY MEAN SINITER2
[0:47:25] <Halospaz117> HIS NAME IS SINESTRO
[0:47:30] <XeroSigmaPrime> WAit Sinestro is always a friend of Hal tho, even when he's a yellow
[0:47:31] <dinnydanny777> Sephiroth still doesn't seem normal in Crisis Core tho
[0:47:32] <+griffball13> sinestro was never good
[0:47:34] <+kewlmyc> xehanort
[0:47:36] <%redrins> but even evil sinestro conciders green lantern a friend
[0:47:38] <%BearSawed> His name is SIN, the best of guys
[0:47:39] <+yoshkosh20> you can trust a man named sinestro
[0:47:42] <available_line> Sephiroth I accept becasue you can never tell who the good guy is in JRPGs.
[0:47:44] <+eanscrale> Vincent Price was perfectly virtuous in some films
[0:47:44] <%Gruhunchously> The thing is, now that we're super light side, lighting will cost more
[0:47:44] <hattrick61> WHAAAAT MR. SINISTER IS A BAD GUY?
[0:47:47] <StarlitStunner> Good ol Thall Sinestro, a name you can trust
[0:47:47] <lotharrio> "Sinestro... could we ever be friends again?" "That's the worst thing, Hal. We were ALWAYS friends."
[0:47:49] <%DSD24> Immortality Belt?
[0:47:57] <+krispen_wa> CC Sephiroth was cool, if not distant
[0:47:57] <%Irridium> imagine the balls naming your belt the immortality belt
[0:47:57] <+JustToWatch> atrocitus though, he seemed legit
[0:48:01] <dinnydanny777> Sephiroth literally has a scene in Crisis Core and in OG 7 where he starts maniacally laughing out of nowhere
[0:48:01] <+Feralspirit41> His name was sinestro ffs and he had that pencil porn stash how could he have ever gotten a green ring
[0:48:09] <%BearSawed> Only name less trustworthy is like Gogh Vandire
[0:48:17] <jorniev> sinestro gets elected president... really realistic portrayal right now.
[0:48:21] <+jiggy_snipe> I think he was always a little unstable
[0:48:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Whats your name
[0:48:36] <+yoshkosh20> ew flesh bug
[0:48:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Damn it
[0:48:39] <DatAsuna> is sinestro a better president than norman osborne?
[0:48:52] <zar011> laggy vid
[0:49:02] <lotharrio> Well... Sinestro brought violent peace to his entire planet...
[0:49:08] <StarlitStunner> @justtowatch Atrocitus was a good guy, he only went bad after green and yellow lanterns killed his family and race.
[0:49:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna Wait, isn't Sinestro an actual alien? How the fuck is he able to become President?
[0:49:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Whats your name? Grognar the Destroyer of Worlds? Eh im sure he's a good guy
[0:49:21] <available_line> violent peace sounds like an oxymoron
[0:49:28] <+yoshkosh20> he became president of the galaxy

[0:52:43] <%jillpilled> It's not worth remembering tho
[0:52:45] <usurper_sos> It doesn't exist
[0:52:46] <%Gruhunchously> Preserve the lie
[0:52:46] <+MillerLowlife> forgetting everything is the optimal state
[0:52:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Episode IX: The Last Command, is really good though
[0:52:49] <Interestedsc00t> the writers forgot everything, too
[0:52:49] <prime_name> Watch the old Best Friends review after that
[0:52:49] <%BearSawed> No, you cant avoid the corruption of the darkside abilities. HAHA Lightning go bRRRR
[0:52:50] <+miyoles> Ray was such a good character in force awakens
[0:52:54] <available_line> Palpatine was basically Madarame at that point.
[0:52:54] <+kekkerscrew> Just watch 7 and 8 and forget about the rest
[0:52:58] <jorniev> i like the memory
[0:52:58] <asylumkon> there is nothing to really remember in VII
[0:53:01] <snakemuho> it like rewatching GoT pretty much
[0:53:02] <available_line> Madara*
[0:53:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> The entire sequels was shit
[0:53:04] <usurper_sos> There is no war in Ba Sing Se
[0:53:10] <Joostebrood> hey Mon Mothma
[0:53:15] <%Gruhunchously> Mon Mothma again
[0:53:21] <boostergoldz> there are no sequels in ba sing se
[0:53:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DR CHAKWAS?
[0:53:24] <+yoshkosh20> I kinda miss that from some of the older crpgs. where it looked like the characters were actually clashing instead of smacking each other in the head all stoic like.
[0:53:27] <KaitlynnHere> I didn’t even care what happened in nine, I never finished it
[0:53:34] <dinnydanny777> Are the prequels better than the sequels?
[0:53:34] <lotharrio> @StarlitStunner Larfleeze hurts my heart. He was amazing at his introduction, and his consistent use as "the strongest lantern" was great as well. But most media is like, "haha look at this loser."
[0:53:37] <+evbites> palpatine pisses me off so much and the worse part is that i know he would love my hate for him
[0:53:49] <%Gruhunchously> PTSD time
[0:53:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1268068275423981569?s=20
[0:53:57] <+Freeborg1997> Not an issue for me, because the original trilogy ended concluded. If the original trilogy ended on a cliffhanger, and the sequels were the follow-up we had, then I'd have a problem.
[0:53:59] <+Feralspirit41> What kind of general were you
[0:54:03] <HorribleHog> 7 was already shit for me rehashing new hope -- the characters were allright though *shrug*
[0:54:12] <GHouseduivel> @Zanco23 Fair.
[0:54:13] <%BearSawed> The prequels are more coherent....which is and accomplishment
[0:54:14] <available_line> I like how Fanny's idle animation is like "what the f did I do again?"
[0:54:23] <socratetris> shiz! i must have missed hours!
[0:54:23] <dinnydanny777> My hot take is that Revenge of the Sith is actually really good
[0:54:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THAT'S TOTALLY DR. CHAKWAS

[0:56:04] <snakemuho> how did they not have a single demolitioner there
[0:56:05] <lotharrio> @StarlitStunner It's been a good bit since I read any lantern stuff. But his introduction, with the Guardians shitting themselves over Agent Orange, and him being this weird multi-galactic presence was great.
[0:56:09] <+kekkerscrew> Just following orders

[0:57:35] <prime_name> Recover the vision mines
[0:57:38] <StarlitStunner> @lotharrio Even if it’s a mixed bag, the Fanfiction “With this Ring” at least shows off how cool orange lanterns can be.
[0:57:41] <hattrick61> recover those memory mines
[0:57:42] <boostergoldz> pockets planted the mines
[0:57:45] <available_line> Mine (Credits)

[0:58:10] <%Irridium> this is assuming they get added to your inventory I honestly don't remmber if you keep them or not
[0:58:10] <ThatGuyThere03> don't armies usually have mine sweeping equipment

[0:59:42] <%DSD24> @ZeeJiggle That's why I feel having options for either options during character creation
[0:59:49] <jorniev> DISCO ELYSIUM
[0:59:54] <Halospaz117> Yeah the best parts of this game is where you're making the choices you already made long ago, if that makes sense
[0:59:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @legacy0117 No, and actually you're LOCKED OUT unless you're medium-high on either side of the alignment chart.
[0:59:58] <+parrotman01> What sucks is that this whole game is a tragedy. This was such a great game, and yet so unfinished
[1:00:05] <DatAsuna> And this is why the cave is great

[1:00:33] <%Gruhunchously> Fann Y'Pak studied demolitions out of regret
[1:00:33] <+jiggy_snipe> I guess you could have ran in alone too

[1:00:42] <StarvingPenguinGod> Kreygasm
[1:00:43] <ZeeJiggle> @DSD24 Oh well of course the best thing is just more options, always would welcome that.
[1:00:45] <+parrotman01> Woolie, you ALWAYS jerk off on the things you love
[1:00:47] <Halospaz117> NO JERK HARDER
[1:00:50] <%RioGascar> i think boardgames can allow this as well, but not sure

[1:01:11] <%Deft_Thought> "Video games are important," reports man who makes his living off of playing Video games
[1:01:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> Ebert was exposed to FUCKING STUPID ASS arthouse nonsense games
[1:01:26] <+Feralspirit41> According to Germany video games aremt art
[1:01:29] <GHouseduivel> @Deft_Thought Really important for him then
[1:01:30] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I would STRONGLY suggest that you save here
[1:01:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> What game did he even play?
[1:01:38] <+griffball13> art depends on the person
[1:01:46] <DatAsuna> It's like the people who automatically assume you're pretentious if you use the word auteur

[1:01:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Art Professors LIVE AND DIE on that though.
[1:01:50] <lotharrio> "What is art?" "Art is meaningless."
[1:01:51] <prime_name> Movies are the work of the DEVIL!
[1:02:00] <HorribleHog> there's art as a subject and art as tax write-offs
[1:02:04] <andrei11dr> Also some people are willing to just shit on new art forms because they're boomers

[1:02:14] <JanusII> Someone argued with me IF THIS STREAM was art. LUL
[1:02:17] <dinnydanny777> This slash I made in a white sheet of paper is art

[1:02:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Greeks literally had people complaining that the proliferation of writing would cause people to lose their ability to remember things.
[1:02:45] <%Deft_Thought> It's not up to them to decide whether or not the medium you work in/enjoy is qualified as art
[1:02:46] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Don't like Greg?
[1:02:53] <+ntfth> @WoolieVersus Fun fact, at this place without the mod, you can spawn infinite Hssiss in here in here to farm exp from.

[1:05:59] <Chatterbox1991> You examine the Jedi Corpse to keep spawning enemies

[1:20:09] <MarkUriah> No it's saying not taking a side is a problem
[1:20:12] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Apathy is death... you're on Korriban. It's the opposite stance of what the Jedi took on the Mandalorian wars
[1:20:14] <Joostebrood> sometimes a scene is just a scene and not the author soapboxing
[1:20:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> And he doesn't get it.
[1:20:15] <+krispen_wa> Video games aren't real, just like the visions

[1:21:45] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> @Wyrm_Swarm I won't spoil it, but there is a legit reason why the Council didn't want to go. But the fact they didn't explain it to their students is fucked

[1:23:05] <GHouseduivel> Forcing you to confront your pain.
[1:23:05] <Joostebrood> Sith Ghosts be mad
[1:23:09] <%DSD24> Revan is missing
[1:23:10] <snakemuho> the Kreia part has some good dialogue for all the options
[1:23:12] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood 😆 hurr durr
[1:23:19] <%GrassCannon> You learned that Apathy is Death
[1:23:20] <%Ashenik1> stoicism
[1:23:32] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> @Wyrm_Swarm I don't remember if it's really explained in the game, but you can whisper me if you want to know
[1:23:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> Fann looks EXHAUSTED
[1:23:38] <Joostebrood> @christopherwpoindexter i really, really like this game's narrative but it has some dumb ass lines sometimes
[1:23:45] <dinnydanny777> Kreia must be very strong to speak to you in this force cave...
[1:23:47] <+syn_draco> @gandalfsmagicgaydick kool
[1:23:49] <Xchunkylover73x> Danm fann is hot
[1:23:52] <%ChoculaUltra> Fann looks legit drained
[1:23:55] <+MillerLowlife> i knew i was the main character
[1:23:57] <%jillpilled> 1 is so self-fellating
[1:24:06] <+griffball13> how do you know that
[1:24:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood tru
[1:24:20] <Halospaz117> Got greivous levels of sabors
[1:24:20] <+Feralspirit41> So whose tomb is this anyway
[1:24:21] <heartlesshealer> Oh hey
[1:24:28] <+Feralspirit41> Oh right
[1:24:29] <+griffball13> sup ludo
[1:24:30] <+syn_draco> @Feralspirit41 Ludo Kresh it seems
[1:24:30] <lotharrio> My CABBAGES!
[1:24:37] <dinnydanny777> This is Ludo Kresh
[1:24:39] <heartlesshealer> force shake
[1:24:40] <Halospaz117> WOAH
[1:24:42] <%ChoculaUltra> they don't even get funeral clothes? just shoved in a ancient night stand?!
[1:24:48] <%Deft_Thought> Ludo's dark influence pulls on the camera!
[1:24:51] <+krispen_wa> Ludo's Quiche
[1:24:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> then again, if this game has been going in real time, the Exile has been more or less awake for like 80+ FUCKIN' HOURS
[1:24:57] <+bear_breaker20> jedi's are known for thier tomb raiding
[1:25:01] <dinnydanny777> Ludacris?
[1:25:03] <available_line> Just float them around with telekinesis at this point. Force Mordenkainen’s Sword.
[1:25:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> How much you gonna bet Woolie is gonna spend the next 30 minutes at the end of this stream trying to parse "Apathy is Death?"
[1:25:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> *HOURS UP TO now
[1:25:20] <%jillpilled> when the mysticism in the area isn't even focused on Ludo LUL
[1:25:21] <dinnydanny777> We got Ludacris's sword?
[1:25:22] <Zebroneath> If only T3 can wear Sith robes
[1:25:29] <%Gruhunchously> @christopherwpoindexter He must have slept during the hyperspace travel at least, right?
[1:25:30] <Joostebrood> that's an amazingly mediocre sword
[1:25:38] <+syn_draco> Canderous melee weapon?
[1:25:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> @gruhunchously very likely
[1:25:56] <lotharrio> It's an okay melee weapon. Slightly less than a Tremor Sword.
[1:25:59] <dinnydanny777> A fairly dark Jedi if he enjoyed stabbing peoppe
[1:26:04] <BurdRightsActivist> Dark Jedi are the same though 4Head
[1:26:17] <heartlesshealer> Was there a door before big fight room that Woolie left alone?
[1:26:20] <%GrassCannon> Anotha one
[1:26:21] <%christopherwpoindexter> And Kaiburr!!!!
[1:26:22] <+Feralspirit41> Kaiburr crystal
[1:26:22] <dinnydanny777> Enjoying stabbing people is just a bit dark
[1:26:29] <penitentpentwitch> Woolie continues to have the best random drop rates in games
[1:26:30] <lotharrio> Mando Disintegrator.
[1:26:30] <heartlesshealer> dual disintegrators!
[1:26:31] <dinnydanny777> Not quite Sith though
[1:26:31] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Slap that shit on HK
[1:26:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> How are these WICKER baskets surviving for thousands of years in a cave?
[1:26:36] <jorniev> give it to mando
[1:26:37] <+oda_flobunaga> Kaiburr Chrystal
[1:26:41] <+krispen_wa> ANUTHA ONE

[1:27:17] <wowowinsane> kaiba crystal
[1:27:17] <%ShadowArcangel> Will we have time for Dantooine today?

[1:27:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> ok got to dress and get dinner, brb, had to see the very end of the PLOT tomb
[1:27:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can't believe that is OPTIONAL.
[1:27:25] <lotharrio> Welp, will never know.
[1:27:33] <available_line> They didn't even wait for you outside the cave. They jut peaced out.
[1:27:34] <dinnydanny777> Stenchy cave
[1:27:35] <%roobanguy> time for the endgame
[1:27:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> apathy is death
[1:27:40] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Ask HK about how to kill crusty boy. Tell him, universe.
[1:27:42] <derap41> I hade some Peyote
[1:27:43] <dinnydanny777> Fann now smells like apathy
[1:27:44] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Now that we have met Sion, HK should have new dialogue
[1:27:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I do NOT want to talk about it."
[1:27:49] <%Irridium> remember, that was optional
[1:27:50] <%ShadowArcangel> Oh yeah. talk to HK!
[1:27:55] <Joostebrood> sabering your ghosts is the #1 PTSD treatment

[1:47:02] <penitentpentwitch> That is some breakup, to be so angry your divorce gives you immortality
[1:47:03] <deuxexgodzilla> Darth Scion is crusty because of all that salt he has.

[1:51:55] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Crusty boi, clutching his ribs, down on his knees as he coughs out blood. Fann approaches as he clenches his lightsaber in his hand. "It's time to finish this," says Fann. From his fannypack, he withdraws a singular Planter's peanut and inserts it between those crusty-ass, chapstick needing lips. "Light later, bitch." Fade to black.

[1:55:25] <DatAsuna> That's your force storm crystal

[1:56:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stats on stats on stats on stats
[1:56:52] <xBUBBA1995x> 32 acctually
[1:56:55] <+yoshkosh20> would a sniper be able to take out a jedi from like a mile away, or would the force warn them ahead of time?
[1:57:17] <+thegoodsamaritam> Qol changes
[1:57:18] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:57:20] <Paragon_of_Laziness> depends if the sniper is also a jedi
[1:57:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> +38?!
[1:57:37] <MarkUriah> @yoshkosh20 Force would probably warn them last second
[1:57:42] <+Reverend_Roscoe> FUCK
[1:57:51] <lotharrio> @yoshkosh20 The further away the Jedi, the more likely they can avoid the shot.
[1:58:14] <+krispen_wa> Did they do HK Pacifist package?
[1:58:18] <%alrobot2014> yep
[1:58:18] <lotharrio> Yea

[1:58:36] <%Gruhunchously> Already done that
[1:58:42] <+syn_draco> @yoshkosh20 John Wick's close enough
[1:58:58] <+yoshkosh20> I also like that distance nullifies the gunfire advantage instead of strenghtening it. genuinely neat
[1:59:08] <snakemuho> it stays like that
[1:59:15] <%GrassCannon> psaGoblins
[1:59:19] <lotharrio> If you talk to the other guy and tell him to fuck off, it might get rid of it.
[1:59:28] <%DemonOfSalt> You can tell him off.
[1:59:34] <DatAsuna> it's a top 5 but it ain't the best
[1:59:34] <+krispen_wa> Enclave is the best track in the game
[1:59:46] <%Gruhunchously> Um, no the BEST track in the game is coming up
[1:59:49] <%DSD24> Didn't Kylo just hold blaster shots
[1:59:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie needs to go
[1:59:51] <DatAsuna> The REAL best track is in the enclave scene we're heading to
[1:59:51] <%DemonOfSalt> You can definitely tell him off unless it is bugged for real.
[1:59:51] <+syn_draco> @legacy0117 At least his character had an actual arc throughout the new trilogy
[1:59:58] <+Feralspirit41> Did woolie turn in the fuel mission for telos?
[2:00:07] <%GrassCannon> Sion Uchiha
[2:00:08] <+Feralspirit41> good
[2:00:11] <+kekkerscrew> Pathedass
[2:00:18] <chll0ne> @wyrm_swarm it was basically just vader but lite to me
[2:00:19] <Halospaz117> I think a mix of pathetic and badass sums up the Sith as a whole
[2:00:22] <FoolproofDread> BRB gonna fly billions of miles across the galaxy to use a bench and immediately leave
[2:00:23] <chll0ne> redemption Kappa

[2:00:37] <+syn_draco> @CozyGUNNA yeaa....
[2:00:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'd love to see someone shotgun a jedi in a duel, and the attempt to deflect makes him eat a faceful of molten metal.
[2:00:48] <+krispen_wa> @ShadowArcangel It turns him into a simp
[2:00:57] <%CyanDeadEye> Gotta love that visual bug where T3 is full dark
[2:01:02] <%Gruhunchously> Sion's dialogue if you're a female PC is significantly different
[2:01:02] <%GrassCannon> iirc that was actually a thing in the EU
[2:01:03] <KnivesEve> wait t3 is evil!?
[2:01:05] <+syn_draco> Dafuq happened to T3??
[2:01:08] <%DSD24> @krispen_wa Is he really a Simp if he's crushing on the EXILE?
[2:01:08] <candidateplays> So I did this exact thing, and after 40 minutes of crafting, the game crashed
[2:01:12] <%CyanDeadEye> Its a visual bug
[2:01:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Evil t3
[2:01:16] <%ChoculaUltra> T3's seen some shit.
[2:01:18] <penitentpentwitch> "He's already dead! He just won't accept it!"
[2:01:20] <MarkUriah> T3 took all the dark side points
[2:01:21] <+Freeborg1997> @KnivesEve Yeah, it was pretty shocking
[2:01:24] <%Gruhunchously> @Wyrm_Swarm He revealed his true colors
[2:01:30] <+yoshkosh20> @candidateplays that's gotta be infuriating
[2:01:31] <%DSD24> Threat Injuries
[2:01:31] <%Irridium> Darth T3
[2:01:39] <Joostebrood> there is a visual bug with alignment occasionally but t3 actually is dark side
[2:01:43] <Joostebrood> thanks to console commands
[2:01:49] <lotharrio> @KnivesEve @Wyrm_Swarm T3 has a bug where if you are 100 influence and 100 lightside, he does an overflow and registers as impossibly dark.
[2:01:55] <+syn_draco> @Gruhunchously I knew I could never trust droids...
[2:01:58] <%CyanDeadEye> Ah
[2:02:10] <+htt0r1hnz0> For 5 years I read the RDR Undead Nightmare mission as "Birth of the CONVERSATION MOMENT"
[2:02:14] <+vaporousTippler> Wait, so T3 is Ghandi?
[2:02:15] <DatAsuna> Yeah I specifically made T3 0 inf and max dark tho
[2:02:21] <%ChoculaUltra> T3 is fueled by gallons of Mando blood from Malachor V.
[2:02:23] <lotharrio> Yeah basically.
[2:02:25] <%ChoculaUltra> So yes, Ghandi.
[2:02:26] <+krispen_wa> The CHAD pose
[2:02:29] <%GrassCannon> bruh
[2:02:31] <DatAsuna> So he can be ghandi but I didn't wanna roll the dice on the bug happening or not
[2:02:32] <Halospaz117> SO WISE
[2:02:36] <lotharrio> Oh did you, @DatAsuna ? that's neat.
[2:02:41] <+Feralspirit41> God hes smelling his farts so hard
[2:02:49] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SMU
[2:02:51] <DatAsuna> Also default influence is 50, so 0 inf can still pass every check as well anyways
[2:02:54] <Space_Pagan> THE WISEST BOI
[2:02:58] <DatAsuna> It's the dragon age rivalry system
[2:03:15] <%ChoculaUltra> don't forget flame throwers and gas
[2:03:16] <+krispen_wa> Except far less intuitive
[2:03:27] <DatAsuna> Going up to 100 or down to 0 passes every check
[2:03:28] <%BisoromiBear> tan lines
[2:03:28] <ZeeJiggle> Wait, can you pass influence checks by making them really hate you?
[2:03:37] <DatAsuna> And yeah dragon age improved it significantly
[2:03:49] <+kapcommunist> PB Captain Crunch is better than the OG
[2:03:49] <%GrassCannon> imo Rivalry system was one of the things DA2 did right
[2:04:00] <Joostebrood> i love the absurd amount of components/credits you get for items that are basically useless in everything but gimmick builds
[2:04:13] <%ChoculaUltra> is it weird that I'm cool with the word vibroblade but not vibrosword? because vibrosword sounds sus
[2:04:20] <lotharrio> Realizing that I should have bullied some of the DA2 characters made me regretful that I put up with their shit.
[2:04:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1268068275423981569?s=20
[2:04:23] <DatAsuna> You're welcome
[2:04:23] <heartlesshealer> !!!
[2:04:35] <+syn_draco> Can't T3 use two?
[2:04:41] <%Gruhunchously> HOLY SHIT it's all coming together
[2:04:44] <+syn_draco> O
[2:04:46] <DatAsuna> he can but he'd have an accuracy penalty
[2:04:49] <asylumkon> isnt it limited to sith prestige classes?
[2:04:50] <Jeemukun> wesssslleeeyy
[2:04:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> DatAsuna got the yomi
[2:05:05] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Wait, what happened??
[2:05:07] <@Solidus_113> totally intentional
[2:05:14] <Joostebrood> HK-47 could use an ion weapon
[2:05:14] <candidateplays> Yeah, literally the only person who can use Freedon nadd's blaster is dark side exile
[2:05:33] <+Feralspirit41> I find it hard to believe that the dashade would use sonic weapons given their history
[2:06:07] <+0gravitybadger0> sup chat actually managed to catch a stream since doom hows the lockdown going for you all
[2:06:08] <DatAsuna> The main ebenfit of sonic/force scream is it reduces their chance to make saving throws on your force powers, so they're very useful against dark jedi, e.g. vision kreia was saving against your force storm
[2:06:11] <%DSD24> Freedom Nads
[2:06:43] <lotharrio> Significantly less useful.
[2:06:48] <%Gruhunchously> Guess what, we're going to be fighting a lot of droids at some point
[2:06:52] <DatAsuna> Ion is only useful for like, the 3 aeas that are droid town
[2:07:14] <lotharrio> Having a handful of ion weapons is still useful going into the end game.
[2:07:27] <%CyanDeadEye> Its funny, G0-T0 has the ability to hack droids, but by the point you get him you're already past the majority of droid enemies in the game.
[2:08:18] <lotharrio> I'd prefer if G0-T0 could just spend money, each planet, to negate a fight with humanoids.
[2:08:24] <DatAsuna> Yeah g0t0's skill was definitely made with droid planet in mind
[2:08:55] <DatAsuna> HK also has a feat that is useless without droid planet installed that just lets you talk to certain kinds of droids
[2:09:29] <%CyanDeadEye> I don't remember where but there's at least one instance where G0-T0 can cancel the bounty on Jedi to a team of bounty hunters.
[2:09:44] <%CyanDeadEye> But its only that one intance
[2:10:12] <DatAsuna> I believe that's leaving the iziz cantina
[2:10:13] <%shincadad> !uptime
[2:10:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 20 minutes
[2:10:35] <chll0ne> cmonBruh
[2:11:12] <lotharrio> How do KotOR crits work, anyway?
[2:11:17] <%CyanDeadEye> There's also that one bartering conversation where he somehow convinces the vendor subtract his value on the slave market on his wares.
[2:11:21] <lotharrio> I always boosted raw damage.
[2:11:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:11:36] <%GrassCannon> x2, plus any massive crit bonuses
[2:11:38] <%Gruhunchously> @DatAsuna I could never figure out what that feat was about
[2:11:50] <RogueKnightXIII> Everytime a character talks during battle = crit
[2:11:58] <RogueKnightXIII> I think
[2:12:02] <lotharrio> So... massive base damage is way better than increased crit damage?
[2:12:10] <DatAsuna> You can improve crit chance yes
[2:12:57] <%GrassCannon> pretty much
[2:13:11] <%GrassCannon> massive critical tends to come with other bonuses, though
[2:13:41] <lotharrio> Hmmm... well figuring out the puzzle of min-max is part of the fun of Number Goes Up.
[2:14:40] <lotharrio> Pontite Lens, IIRC was amazing.
[2:15:00] <%shincadad> So that means no Jedi council today :(
[2:15:16] <%GrassCannon> x2
[2:15:30] <lotharrio> It doubles whatever your base was.
[2:15:35] <DatAsuna> keen is always good
[2:16:06] <%GrassCannon> d20 makes it look more confusing than it is, but it doubles the number of outcomes that result in a crit
[2:16:31] <lotharrio> Break down all those historical relics.
[2:16:46] <%GrassCannon> some people would
[2:16:58] <lotharrio> I've seen the websites.

[2:22:55] <+Feralspirit41> And i pulled out my gun!

[2:28:26] <+Creggamonsta> ok thanks
[2:28:30] <ThatGuyThere03> so is HK still a murder bot despite being max light side?
[2:28:31] <%roobanguy> put the other pistol in his hand and see what his attack modifier is
[2:28:35] <+shapeforn> They are like... 3/4 there i believe
[2:28:50] <available_line> I'm scared we won't get council meeting.
[2:28:52] <%roobanguy> if his modifier is high enough it doesnt matter if he has the feats or not
[2:29:06] <fuji_92> more like 2/3, there's some shit to happen yet

[2:31:14] <ingman112> I checked some shit and the other two lines disappear
[2:31:15] <%DemonOfSalt> It's definitely worth watching all endings to see your choice in context.
[2:31:16] <furcifer93> Don’t worry, you’ll get all you want, Woolie, in KOTOR III.
[2:31:39] <available_line> NotLikeThis ResidentSleeper
[2:31:44] <+shapeforn> Man, if any game deserves a good remake its Kotor II...
[2:31:50] <dirtyloser1997> I mean looking at how the conversations go, Woolie clearly favors a grey line of thinking (or at least prefers less conflict between party members. The Sith Avellone cave just doesn't like fence sitting
[2:31:52] <chll0ne> facts^^
[2:31:58] <+krispen_wa> If any game deserves a good sequel, it's KOTOR II
[2:32:07] <chll0ne> facts*
[2:32:14] <chll0ne> ^
[2:32:17] <%DesertPenguin> Big and strong?
[2:32:28] <jorniev> TRU FACTS
[2:32:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> @krispen_wa @shapeforn loudly agreeing with u 😆
[2:32:34] <%Gruhunchously> FRMANDLORE
[2:32:35] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:32:36] <+Kduff89> MAGLFABRAGH
[2:32:48] <available_line> It was a SITH cave, of course it paints conflict as an us-vs-them situation with no way to de-escalate.
[2:32:48] <%DemonOfSalt> @dirtyloser1997 All the more reason for him to compare the other sequences.
[2:33:16] <GHouseduivel> Just incase
[2:33:34] <+shapeforn> I do wonder if that kind of remake would make its money, I'd like to think it would.
[2:33:41] <dirtyloser1997> @DemonOfSalt Ye true. Just noting he probably won't like the results
[2:33:44] <Dangerzone979> @WoolieVersus Wait doesn't Mandalore already get regen? Does that stack with the armor mod?
[2:33:45] <GHouseduivel> Are you assembling these upgrades?
[2:33:45] <fuji_92> Justin case
[2:33:56] <lotharrio> You can double regen, @Dangerzone979
[2:34:03] <DatAsuna> except you have a crit upgrade on hr when she's not specced for crit
[2:34:13] <Dangerzone979> @lotharrio ok cool, wasn't sure
[2:34:15] <+krispen_wa> Wait
[2:34:36] <DatAsuna> He "can" dual wield but he shouldn't
[2:34:38] <+krispen_wa> isn't most of the party just straight up not available for endgame
[2:34:48] <%DemonOfSalt> @DatAsuna Facts.
[2:34:50] <DatAsuna> unless you have an extra 3 feats
[2:34:52] <+krispen_wa> all of this prepping only matters for 2 companions
[2:34:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> @fuji_92 Justin Time. a random pun from Justin Timberlake hosting on a Nick's Kids Choice Awards like 14 years ago. don_t know why my brain decided to remember that after all this years
[2:34:55] <dirtyloser1997> CAN =/= Good at it
[2:34:58] <Space_Pagan> restored content
[2:35:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dirtyloser1997 preach
[2:35:38] <+krispen_wa> wait nevermind, most companions have solo playable moments
[2:35:41] <GHouseduivel> OOF
[2:35:54] <%Gruhunchously> Revenge
[2:36:03] <dirtyloser1997> Betrayal!
[2:36:03] <%CyanDeadEye> Don't they have a spare Jal Shey armor set for Atton since he's a Jedi?
[2:36:08] <%DemonOfSalt> @dirtyloser1997 Granted, but that's okay.
[2:36:13] <DatAsuna> Visas is very outspoken about onderon politics if you bring her lol
[2:36:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> oh, wait wait, I think Mira needs pretty great stuff, based on a solo section of hers, I can't elaborate beyond that
[2:36:26] <MarkUriah> alright guys see you next week
[2:36:30] <+Feralspirit41> So is this when the stream ends and we get blue balled
[2:36:31] <fuji_92> PLOT TIME
[2:36:32] <%Gruhunchously> She's also all about murduring people in the cantina
[2:36:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> @markuriah NO
[2:36:37] <dereks0n> 1 2 3 time baby
[2:36:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> PLEASE ENCLACE
[2:36:47] <%Irridium> would be a good idea to give her a lightsaber as a second weapon at least
[2:36:50] <dirtyloser1997> NOOO
[2:36:50] <available_line> EN CLAVE
[2:36:50] <DatAsuna> oh prestige classes
[2:36:50] <lotharrio> Oh there we go. Finally back to the stream.
[2:36:50] <%christopherwpoindexter> PLEASE ENCLAVE
[2:36:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Booooooooo
[2:36:54] <+krispen_wa> SHIT
[2:36:59] <snakemuho> HOW IS HE NOT
[2:36:59] <dirtyloser1997> Go into save editor and give him a level in the class
[2:37:00] <Space_Pagan> boooooooo
[2:37:01] <%Gruhunchously> Droids can't be Sith
[2:37:01] <dirtyloser1997> DO IT
[2:37:01] <+syn_draco> ughhhhh
[2:37:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:37:07] <+Kduff89> MOD IT
[2:37:07] <dirtyloser1997> Save editor a level to him
[2:37:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> enclave and then you can stop
[2:37:12] <DatAsuna> I could probably edit that too, but being a droid it could give you the arren kae bug
[2:37:14] <%CyanDeadEye> Save editor T3 into a Sith Lord/Assassin/Marauder
[2:37:16] <snakemuho> YEYE Save edit him into sith lord
[2:37:18] <GHouseduivel> But he is a Sith Assassin in our hearts <3
[2:37:20] <dirtyloser1997> true lol
[2:37:21] <derap41> Got you played
[2:37:21] <+MidnightBurst12> laaaame
[2:37:26] <+Kduff89> YEYEY
[2:37:29] <%christopherwpoindexter> just enclave and then end the stream only after that
[2:37:30] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> force command prompt?
[2:37:32] <chll0ne> rip
[2:37:36] <dirtyloser1997> @DatAsuna Fair forgot about that
[2:37:40] <lotharrio> Next week. More editsa.
[2:37:40] <%DemonOfSalt> @DatAsuna O.o, The what now?
[2:37:50] <available_line> Force Save Edit his class.
[2:37:54] <+Feralspirit41> I like that woolie still has mining lasers in his ijventory
[2:37:58] <derap41> The Sharingan=?
[2:38:02] <%Gruhunchously> @DatAsuna The what now?
[2:38:22] <+Kduff89> man I love the way chat thinks
[2:38:25] <DatAsuna> @DemonOfSalt if your save gets corrupted your name changes t arren kae and you get a random payer appearance with no gear and no party members
[2:38:26] <+krispen_wa> Is Arren Kae the Gaster of KOTOR II?
[2:38:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> @demonofsalt @gruhunchously it's a developer command console version of the main character called Arren Kae, for debug testing. Speedrunners use it.
[2:38:34] <DatAsuna> It's a game ruining save corruption
[2:38:45] <dinnydanny777> Arren Kae sounds like a Karen
[2:38:51] <%redrins> solvem probed
[2:38:52] <%DemonOfSalt> ...I love this game, I had now idea. XD
[2:38:54] <%alrobot2014> @DatAsuna i had that happen and never understood why, thanks
[2:38:55] <%DemonOfSalt> *no
[2:38:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> *I assume for debug testing
[2:39:02] <+krispen_wa> HERE WE GOOOOO
[2:39:02] <DatAsuna> And despite Arren Kae being a cool lore name, it likely only uses that because as an A name it's likely the first value in the array
[2:39:04] <%DemonOfSalt> @DatAsuna Thank you.
[2:39:08] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 I want to talk to your Jedi Master. RIGHT NOW

[2:43:53] <Dangerzone979> @derap41 He needs the hat from Morrowind, the pointy one
[2:43:56] <MarkUriah> It's canon that the Exile force speeds his way to the Enclave
[2:43:58] <%Gruhunchously> I would say there are *several* conversations that matter, but...

[2:49:46] <%christopherwpoindexter> from the aTop
[2:49:48] <ManlyMcBeefington> we did miss the keira speech
[2:49:57] <%roobanguy> yes
[2:50:00] <%roobanguy> no you missed dialog
[2:50:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[2:50:03] <$StaceMcGate> My one regret of this LP is Woolie didn't use Force Affinity vision on Ed Asner
[2:50:06] <heartlesshealer> bye dialogue
[2:50:07] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> If you bring Kriea she has more dialouge
[2:50:08] <+krispen_wa> You missed Kreia's dialogue because you didn't bring her
[2:50:11] <heartlesshealer> Link woolie later
[2:50:15] <%roobanguy> bringing kreia with you she has more to say when she sits down
[2:50:16] <giga_bit> yeah but it's fine, just a couple of nice little lines with kreia
[2:50:17] <fuji_92> not skip, just some fluff miss
[2:50:25] <MarkUriah> its fine
[2:50:27] <ingman112> Ask that last
[2:50:27] <+xShenzi> Missed a few lines of Kreia when you entered the place
[2:50:30] <jorniev> fluff
[2:50:30] <lotharrio> Not a fuck up.
[2:50:32] <%ShadowArcangel> theres dialogue if you bring Kreia I believe
[2:50:32] <+jiggy_snipe> no it didn;t mess up
[2:50:33] <giga_bit> No it's not the glitch
[2:50:34] <%DemonOfSalt> It's not a bug.
[2:50:35] <derap41> Its fine just Kreia fluff
[2:50:37] <dereks0n> No it's not a fuck up
[2:50:37] <%alrobot2014> it wasn't the dialogue skip bug
[2:50:39] <prime_name> No fuck ups, just party lore
[2:50:39] <+SolidusRex> It's because you didn't bring Kreia, alternate scene
[2:50:40] <DatAsuna> if it does it again just turn the game off and on again
[2:50:40] <%shincadad> No
[2:50:40] <lotharrio> Not a glitch
[2:50:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> swap out Kreia?
[2:50:41] <Halospaz117> it's fine
[2:50:41] <PinkSocks> It's not a glitch, just cause you didn't bring Kreia.
[2:50:43] <giga_bit> It's because you didn't have her in the party
[2:50:43] <lotharrio> Not a fuck up.
[2:50:45] <TDAWS_MP132> it's not enough to reset on
[2:50:45] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> its not a fuck up. People are telling you to bring Kriea
[2:50:48] <privatesargent> not fucked up, you just missed some dialofgue with kreia
[2:50:48] <ZeeJiggle> Not the bug, just extra dialogue if you bring Kreia in the party.
[2:50:50] <heartlesshealer> IT'S NOT THE BUG. It's a different thing
[2:50:50] <+krispen_wa> It wasn't a skip, but alternate scene
[2:50:51] <+thackattack00> chat NotLikeThis
[2:50:51] <%DemonOfSalt> It's your choice.
[2:50:52] <%shincadad> It’s not
[2:50:53] <ZeeJiggle> apparently.
[2:50:54] <ingman112> No it’s not a dialogue skip
[2:50:55] <+SolidusRex> Not a glitch, just alternate party thing
[2:50:57] <%Superspider51> Universe says bring Kreia
[2:50:58] <+Feralspirit41> there wasnt a dialogue skip bug chat is talking about stuff you missed by not taking kreia with you off the ship
[2:51:01] <%Irridium> no nothing messed up you just didn't get the some kreia dialog since she wasn't in your party
[2:51:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> i think u did
[2:51:02] <fuji_92> not the glitch, just fluff miss cause he didn't bring Kreia
[2:51:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Missed dialogue for not having Kreiia in the Party.
[2:51:05] <DatAsuna> This bug usually happens after long sessions
[2:51:06] <BurdRightsActivist> BLACK SABBATH PARANOID
[2:51:07] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> It's not a glitch, they're saying you just missed Kreia dialogue b/c you didn't bring her
[2:51:10] <lotharrio> Kreia has extra dialogue. You didn't bring her so don't worry.
[2:51:15] <ManlyMcBeefington> RIP Keira speech
[2:51:16] <DatAsuna> just closing the game usually fixes it
[2:51:17] <+Kyma1020> You did not a fuck up
[2:51:23] <jorniev> keep going
[2:51:23] <privatesargent> @Feralspirit41 its not the dialogue skip everybody is talking about
[2:51:24] <ingman112> But definitely save the “why did you exile me” for last
[2:51:25] <%roobanguy> NO
[2:51:26] <available_line> Let it go chat.

[2:52:12] <+krispen_wa> BRING KREIA

[2:52:16] <+krispen_wa> BRING KREIA TOO
[2:52:17] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You need Kriea with you
[2:52:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> Bring Kreia
[2:52:18] <DatAsuna> not just reload, close the game
[2:52:19] <%DemonOfSalt> Bring Kreia.
[2:52:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> You need Kreia in your party.
[2:52:22] <Space_Pagan> oh noooooo

[2:52:23] <ingman112> Yeee yeee yeee
[2:52:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Need Kreia in party?
[2:52:26] <%Superspider51> Universe says bring Kreia
[2:52:29] <Monkeyweed21> bring Kreia to dab on the jedi
[2:52:32] <fuji_92> chat's being too paranoid
[2:52:32] <snakemuho> that's KOTOR2 for ya
[2:52:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> just stuff u might miss. also bring Kreia
[2:52:38] <%roobanguy> @WoolieVersus so you need to talk about the sith first in this convo or it goes to the end immediatly
[2:52:38] <$StaceMcGate> Gotta bring Granny there Woolie
[2:52:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Don't look at me, first time seeing this.
[2:52:41] <giga_bit> it's not even the memory leak glitch
[2:52:41] <%DemonOfSalt> Bring Kreia to get all dialogue.
[2:52:41] <DatAsuna> ya hate to see it
[2:52:42] <Space_Pagan> oh thank god
[2:52:42] <+krispen_wa> You can miss SO MUCH dialogue in this game
[2:52:43] <Goodvibes99508> 14 months
[2:52:43] <+thegoodsamaritam> Universe says bring Kreia
[2:52:48] <heartlesshealer> Sure, test however you need to
[2:52:53] <zeow31> being kreia with you and start the conversation with the first option
[2:52:59] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Ok but that music though, right guys?
[2:53:00] <%roobanguy> what zeow said
[2:53:01] <zeow31> being kreia*
[2:53:02] <snakemuho> if you alt+f4 it shows yes/no option
[2:53:02] <ingman112> The Kreia thing is part, but the main thing is making sure you ask why you were exiled LAST
[2:53:03] <penitentpentwitch> Bring Kreia and start from the top seems to be the universe's suggestion.
[2:53:06] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> the dialogue trees are a tad fucky in this game
[2:53:07] <KaitlynnHere> Well, I’ll see you all next week
[2:53:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> you got this Woolie, we'll get there
[2:53:10] <+xddddsorandom> The game just be like that I guess
[2:53:13] <%DemonOfSalt> Bring Kreia, go down the list, you'll be fine.
[2:53:25] <%Malik1002> fucking sounds of nature in the background
[2:53:25] <fuji_92> yeah, just ask why last
[2:53:30] <+krispen_wa> It's not the dialogue bug
[2:53:38] <+krispen_wa> it's just missing a bunch of dialogue paths
[2:53:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:53:43] <+thegoodsamaritam> !uptime
[2:53:44] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 4 minutes
[2:53:47] <%DemonOfSalt> You didn't bug, but you did accidentally miss content twice.
[2:53:48] <prime_name> So, bring Kriea and start from 1?
[2:53:49] <lotharrio> These games are built to be played at least twice... but you know. Things happen.
[2:53:49] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> I don't think it is the bug, but better safe than sorry I guess
[2:53:51] <jorniev> Sadness
[2:53:52] <%christopherwpoindexter> Force Alt F4
[2:53:55] <+krispen_wa> Woolie is broke
[2:53:56] <%roobanguy> yeah its not the dialog bug you just missed a whole bunch of dialog from the masters
[2:53:59] <+Freeborg1997> No, you just missed dialogue with Kreia by not bringing her.
[2:53:59] <%christopherwpoindexter> we got this bois
[2:53:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's not a bug, but by not picking 1 you lose the chance to go down the path for 1, apparently. Also need Kreia to get full extent of the conversation.
[2:54:00] <ingman112> Yeah it’s not a skip bug
[2:54:00] <BurdRightsActivist> get them with the TALK NO JUTSU
[2:54:01] <DatAsuna> I had a super buggy onderon run the other week
[2:54:03] <penitentpentwitch> Can you tank more Asner? Do you have the fortitude?
[2:54:04] <lotharrio> Keep that hologram up, Woolie.
[2:54:10] <KaitlynnHere> Is it just the lighting or is there a purple strip between the red and blue one?
[2:54:12] <fuji_92> yeah, it's not the bug just missable dialogue
[2:54:13] <%christopherwpoindexter> EVERYTHING IS FINE
[2:54:14] <+sphiraki> The universe says play pazaak with Vrook
[2:54:16] <+AnthraxJohnson> God bless PC ports
[2:54:16] <TDAWS_MP132> pick the dialogue in order from top to bottom
[2:54:17] <%DemonOfSalt> You got this.
[2:54:22] <%GrassCannon> it's the lighting
[2:54:22] <heartlesshealer> It will be worth it
[2:54:29] <dereks0n> Wasn't a bug, not a bug at all, just a dialogue order mix up and a need to bring a different party
[2:54:30] <%DemonOfSalt> Hail Fann Y'Pak!!
[2:54:31] <available_line> There was no dialog bug. Chat is rabid becasue of two things. By picking 2 instead on 1, you missed an entire dialogue tree.
[2:54:35] <fuji_92> Chat is exageranting this a little
[2:54:37] <KaitlynnHere> Woolie is gonna fix it
[2:54:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> This is why restored content mod, also....
[2:54:38] <snakemuho> bring Kreia in party and ask about exile last @WoolieVersus
[2:54:40] <Space_Pagan> you need to have the ultimate experience, Woolie
[2:54:41] <%GraceTBM> I second picking dialogue from top to bottom
[2:54:52] <$StaceMcGate> You're missing her best dialog in the game
[2:55:01] <%roobanguy> a little
[2:55:04] <MarkUriah> small tidbits
[2:55:04] <jorniev> its your choice woolie
[2:55:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Significant tidbits.
[2:55:18] <%roobanguy> but you need to talk about the SITH FIRST IN THE DIALOG OR YOU SKIP TOWARDS THE END
[2:55:19] <fuji_92> it's bring Kreia and ask why last
[2:55:26] <heartlesshealer> It's fine, tech stuff is necessary
[2:55:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @roobanguy ^
[2:55:29] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> I think they want you to bring Kreia in and start from 1 and work your way down on the dialogue tree
[2:55:30] <KaiserMario> I thought LittleV was the expert?
[2:55:30] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> She doesn't
[2:55:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> pick 1
[2:55:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @roobanguy
[2:55:32] <+AnthraxJohnson> Boner. Deflated.
[2:55:39] <+krispen_wa> Nah, the best dialogue was the one before you meet the masters
[2:55:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> 11111111
[2:55:45] <%roobanguy> dont ask about the exile to last
[2:55:48] <ingman112> Yeah I’ve been saying it, but the one caveat is asking why last. It’s two different options in the conversation that hardlock it
[2:55:53] <fuji_92> yeah chat is exageranting stuff
[2:55:56] <DatAsuna> Also, without restored content mod, you wouldn't be seeing her and handmaiden though
[2:55:58] <KaitlynnHere> Boner popped
[2:56:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> pick 1111111
[2:56:08] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus Heavy recomendation on asking about the sith first
[2:56:08] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus For Optimal Results, bring Kreia when you arrive, and pick the top option first.
[2:56:10] <+AnthraxJohnson> Boner inverted
[2:56:14] <available_line> Actually ,according to chat, you are missing dialogue because you didn't pick 1. By picknig 2 you skipped to the end of the whole convo.
[2:56:17] <%roobanguy> yes it will
[2:56:19] <KaitlynnHere> Boner withered
[2:56:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Top down is fine.
[2:56:22] <snakemuho> it skips the entire dialogue
[2:56:24] <jorniev> calm your boners universe
[2:56:25] <%roobanguy> once you ask about your exile its over
[2:56:28] <%DemonOfSalt> Everyone chill.
[2:56:31] <furcifer93> I’ve always brought Kreia.
[2:56:31] <fuji_92> top down is fine
[2:56:32] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus One Guyniverse is apparently saying that asking about the exile early will prevent stuff.
[2:56:36] <%Irridium> well, if you pick the bottom to kill them all... LUL
[2:56:37] <fuji_92> chill chat
[2:56:40] <+krispen_wa> I think we might have destroyed Woolie's hype
[2:56:40] <+AnthraxJohnson> Boner expired
[2:56:40] <Safarihat> exile question is hardlock
[2:56:41] <giga_bit> LUL

[2:56:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL
[2:56:53] <%therabbles> Do what you want
[2:56:53] <Space_Pagan> bit of backseat happening here
[2:56:56] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> But more importantly the MUSIC
[2:56:56] <$Invlux> OneGuy clown car
[2:56:57] <%CyanDeadEye> Is this how Moon Knight feels?
[2:56:59] <%Gruhunchously> We want what's best for you Woolie

[2:57:03] <%jillpilled> you do you Woolie
[2:57:06] <%DemonOfSalt> V, you are so right.
[2:57:06] <KaiserMario> Hey, chat may be wrong, but what's the harm in trying what they are suggesting?
[2:57:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> @gandalfsmagicgaydick yes
[2:57:12] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> do we get to drink
[2:57:18] <stardustcrusad3r> dreamt12Angry dreamt12Angry dreamt12Angry
[2:57:27] <%GraceTBM> @KaiserMario they just don't like to be backseated, which is fair
[2:57:28] <ingman112> That’s me, sorry to potentially kill the hype but I did a bunch of research and it’ll a hundred percent skip to the end if you ask that
[2:57:30] <KaitlynnHere> Boner squashed
[2:57:34] <+PlumpPotatoRump> majinoSeshun
[2:57:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wouldn't have stopped if you told me.
[2:57:37] <lotharrio> Oh I already emptied by 12 pack.
[2:57:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> AA is for quitters.
[2:57:44] <+krispen_wa> FROZEN?
[2:57:46] <KaiserMario> @GraceTBM Disable chat then... lUL
[2:57:49] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:57:49] <+Feralspirit41> Its not alcoholism if you dont admit you have a problem
[2:57:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh game is big thinking.
[2:57:54] <Space_Pagan> hungry boi
[2:57:56] <heartlesshealer> Sound exist, good work!
[2:58:00] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> the hype will come back, scene is too good
[2:58:02] <+AnthraxJohnson> Boner shriveled
[2:58:07] <prime_name> Sound is good
[2:58:11] <%christopherwpoindexter> sorry everybody, just trying to lean in, especially for a scene like this, but I'll take one of the One-guy.
[2:58:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, it's kind of bad that it's like that.
[2:58:18] <MarkUriah> @KaiserMario The problem is that it messes up the flow of the game. Not a super big problem but it can ruin enjoyment to a degree.
[2:58:21] <giga_bit> MANY GUYS
[2:58:22] <KaitlynnHere> It’s not alcoholism if you die from alcohol poisoning
[2:58:23] <+krispen_wa> Pls Woolie's computer don't die
[2:58:24] <%Gruhunchously> It does this
[2:58:26] <prime_name> We got crash?
[2:58:27] <Monkeyweed21> Bring Kreia
[2:58:28] <%christopherwpoindexter> and gals?
[2:58:28] <heartlesshealer> hungry boy gotta load
[2:58:29] <snakemuho> Dialogue boss battle lost, gotta hard restard the game

[2:58:35] <+bear_breaker20> AA is a scam tho
[2:58:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> COMPUTER BIG THINKING
[2:58:41] <penitentpentwitch> Even Ackbar couldn't see that trap coming!
[2:58:48] <+Feralspirit41> Thank god
[2:58:48] <GHouseduivel> Force spinning
[2:58:49] <%GraceTBM> "bring a party member" vs "pick these options in this order" seems to feel different to the guys
[2:58:53] <KaitlynnHere> @gruhunchously don’t! You’ll miss the best paaaaaart
[2:58:55] <%therabbles> the amount of saves is making the game chug

[2:59:27] <chll0ne> do it next week
[2:59:28] <+bear_breaker20> and woolies hard drive crashes through the Force-Nah
[2:59:28] <+AnthraxJohnson> “When are we gonna get to the fireworks factory?!”

[3:02:38] <+Kduff89> stars look like stars

[3:03:49] <%roobanguy> fucking love this scene
[3:03:50] <ingman112> As a heads up to the chat, there are two conversation options that trigger the end, both versions of “why did you exile me.” The ones to start with are “the sith” and “why hide”
[3:03:58] <CursedNobleman> haha, camera pan goes BRRRRRRRRR
[3:04:06] <BurdRightsActivist> Can someone give me the drinking game?
[3:04:07] <GHouseduivel> @bear_breaker20 Just absorb the life force of all living things near you
[3:04:08] <$StaceMcGate> He is brain-washed by Kreia to think he is saving Onderon
[3:04:16] <%DesertPenguin> Is this end game?

[3:22:54] <MarkUriah> back to lvl 1
[3:22:57] <KaitlynnHere> punishment?!
[3:23:00] <%DesertPenguin> That power is never talked about. Why didn't they take the force away from The Emperor?
[3:23:07] <dinnydanny777> These Jedi suck
[3:23:12] <heartlesshealer> They're saying hungry boy does not exist and it's all you
[3:23:12] <KaitlynnHere> We did what you asked mo fos!
[3:23:15] <Halospaz117> "Are the sith a problem? No, it is the Fann who is a threat"
[3:23:17] <BurdRightsActivist> @dinnydanny777 Jedi suck
[3:23:18] <GHouseduivel> More like, it was you Son, I learned it all from you
[3:23:27] <+ItsRatman> Hmmm we have three stacks of juicy EXP standing in front of us
[3:23:34] <Vicemond> they have no control
[3:23:37] <$Invlux> what alignment color is Bitch?
[3:23:38] <%DesertPenguin> Choos 3
[3:23:39] <candidateplays> @DesertPenguin They can['t just flip it off from a distance, they'd have to defeat him first.
[3:23:39] <+Freeborg1997> @heartlesshealer I thought they were saying hungry boy learned from us
[3:23:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Vrook already deserved to go, now these other twos need to for being stooges.
[3:23:42] <%Irridium> we also have a chance to see a pretty cool cutscene
[3:23:44] <+krispen_wa> Basically they're judging you because they're idiots who don't know that hungry boi exists
[3:23:45] <%roobanguy> where bao looks at you nod
[3:23:48] <deuxexgodzilla> but muh force!
[3:23:50] <+jiggy_snipe> you guys should probably try and use this proto hungry boy to defeat this new sith
[3:23:51] <+bear_breaker20> you are also the one teaching the sith by accident....
[3:23:54] <Paragon_of_Laziness> LUL
[3:23:54] <%Gruhunchously> Except you
[3:23:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @krispen_wa And refuses to listen to you when you try to tell them.
[3:23:58] <dinnydanny777> We sure these guys are light side?
[3:23:59] <heartlesshealer> @Zanco23 No, they're talking about hungry boy's workers
[3:24:01] <+syn_draco> So they're blaming you for creating the exp system & then creating these crazy ass new Sith that also use that system
[3:24:02] <DatAsuna> no, just everything dies
[3:24:06] <%mar_krow> Look at these fleshy exp bag
[3:24:08] <Halospaz117> You feel an entire planet die, after you caused it
[3:24:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Are they at this point? Would Force Sight actually paint them Blue?
[3:24:22] <308caliber> you're basically the cause of this huge new threat
[3:24:23] <Halospaz117> And guilt
[3:24:24] <%roobanguy> maybe all those combined!!!
[3:24:26] <lotharrio> Well even more. The reason you are important. They talked about that, right?
[3:24:27] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Vrook corrupted the other too. He truly is everything wrong with the Jedi Order
[3:24:31] <dead_harmony13> audio is fucked
[3:24:32] <+Kduff89> this reminds me of the beginning of Infamous.
[3:24:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Damashi_The_Kaotic Not even hyperbole.
[3:24:38] <available_line> Through your ability to make force bonds, you feel the whole planet die, multiplied by your force bonds, and you become a force black hole.
[3:24:49] <snakemuho> @Kduff89 yeah
[3:24:50] <terramagus> Vrook is such a shit he broke the audio for everyone, confirmed
[3:24:52] <+jake5713> Force coma more like.
[3:24:53] <BurdRightsActivist> Forcepekku
[3:24:53] <derap41> Force Sudoko
[3:24:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Force Mute
[3:24:57] <+bear_breaker20> or to protect the force itself ?
[3:25:00] <+bear_breaker20> idk
[3:25:03] <+jjjkopf> Force yeet
[3:25:05] <MarkUriah> You got all that Genocide EXP
[3:25:08] <jorniev> tag force break
[3:25:10] <%GrassCannon> Force Wild Card Arcana
[3:25:10] <lotharrio> So the Exile's real power, was the FRIENDS HE MADE ALONG THE WAY!
[3:25:15] <+krispen_wa> you don't have the force. You drain the force from everyone else and pool it into yuorself
[3:25:16] <+WutangchickeN> Force Twitter
[3:25:20] <Vicemond> force kill streak
[3:25:21] <%DSD24> Fann has frozen up
[3:25:22] <derap41> @lotharrio ah you fuck
[3:25:28] <%shincadad> THE EXILE IS A PERSONA PROTAGONIST
[3:25:28] <dinnydanny777> The exile's real power was friendship
[3:25:32] <+Kduff89> genocide exp. That is something I thought I would never hear or laugh at
[3:25:32] <lotharrio> ;3
[3:25:37] <dinnydanny777> The Exile's friends are his power
[3:25:40] <+Estuko> uwu
[3:25:41] <+Sebenoth> if only Fann was T-posing to assert dominance
[3:25:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Drunkengen
[3:25:44] <jorniev> the bond is just a force vacuum
[3:25:45] <CursedNobleman> your force powers are deserived from protagonist powers
[3:25:46] <Monkeyweed21> you cut yourself off from the force but are still leeching the force from people you form force bonds with
[3:25:46] <Jmann1892> You're good at Force Bonds the same way Bastila is good at Battle Meditation
[3:25:48] <%DSD24> Mira doesn't kill people either
[3:25:49] <derap41> You're Force Approachable
[3:25:50] <Parapattern> You're still pulling people in like a vacuum
[3:25:52] <Paragon_of_Laziness> you are dio brando
[3:25:53] <+xShenzi> You are subconsciously leeching force/life from anyone around you, the longer you are around someone the more you force your will on them
[3:25:54] <dinnydanny777> The Exile : My friends are my powee
[3:26:04] <derap41> Even Draoids
[3:26:04] <+bear_breaker20> woolie's a vampire with hypnotism too!
[3:26:06] <CursedNobleman> surprise! gameplay integration!
[3:26:12] <+MagicBeanBurrito> You have nakama
[3:26:12] <+krispen_wa> YES
[3:26:13] <penitentpentwitch> The Strongest Jedi Influence Vampire!
[3:26:15] <Dementedpenguin> psaMenace
[3:26:15] <+WutangchickeN> force Grindr, but you are the only person the Galaxy matches with.
[3:26:16] <+syn_draco> Yeeeep
[3:26:18] <+jjjkopf> It's also the reason you keep companions no matter dark vs light
[3:26:20] <+krispen_wa> And your enemies
[3:26:22] <Halospaz117> Them and those you kill
[3:26:22] <Monkeyweed21> basically yes
[3:26:23] <%Gruhunchously> That's pretty much it
[3:26:24] <jorniev> FORCE JRPG PROTAGONIST
[3:26:25] <KaitlynnHere> It’s a give and take
[3:26:25] <+MagicBeanBurrito> feeding on bonds
[3:26:26] <+AsinPersuasion> no
[3:26:27] <heartlesshealer> wiretapping the force
[3:26:28] <+Exicuren> KOTOR 2 was the Social Links we made along the way
[3:26:28] <dinnydanny777> My friends are my power
[3:26:29] <derap41> Its more that you're eatin the people youy killl
[3:26:30] <%Camail> I'd think of it as parasitic
[3:26:30] <BurdRightsActivist> NOW I'VE GOT YOUR POWER
[3:26:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> You are a living star forge woolie
[3:26:33] <dinnydanny777> I fight for my friends
[3:26:34] <%ShadowArcangel> and from the people you kill too
[3:26:34] <+AsinPersuasion> youre using it through them
[3:26:34] <deuxexgodzilla> it's like the crystals
[3:26:35] <available_line> It's like your event horizon.
[3:26:37] <asylumkon> dont forget you got the force back right after you met kreia
[3:26:37] <KaitlynnHere> It’s like sharing
[3:26:37] <+syn_draco> And the people that you kill
[3:26:38] <Monkeyweed21> light side is a give and take
[3:26:40] <dinnydanny777> You are literally an anime character
[3:26:40] <cosmicgoatee> force licchhh
[3:26:40] <+AsinPersuasion> theyre conduits
[3:26:41] <AnacondaVirtue> It's not draining, it's sharing
[3:26:41] <+charmquarke> no it's power of friendship
[3:26:42] <deuxexgodzilla> scraping it off of the top
[3:26:42] <lotharrio> Revan didn't have this power. But he definitely convinced you, and you convinced a LOT of other people to join him in his war.
[3:26:42] <+krispen_wa> Basically
[3:26:43] <MarkUriah> Sharing
[3:26:43] <fuji_92> IT'S PERSONA WOOLIE
[3:26:43] <%Irridium> less drain move like skimming from the top
[3:26:43] <%RioGascar> So...why is kreia able to resist it?
[3:26:44] <%redrins> getting your force back from having others around you
[3:26:44] <+WutangchickeN> carciClench carciClench carciClench carciClench carciClench
[3:26:44] <jorniev> and out everyone you kill
[3:26:45] <+MidnightBurst12> more like easier connecting to the force throught friends
[3:26:46] <candidateplays> That's definitely how Vrook sees it
[3:26:47] <dinnydanny777> You are every single anime character
[3:26:49] <%mar_krow> Force online hookups
[3:26:49] <DatAsuna> Hanharr has something specifically aboout this too
[3:26:49] <derap41> Also From the peoplle youkill
[3:26:52] <%CyanDeadEye> You're using the excess Force energy they're radiating as a Lightsider
[3:26:52] <Jmann1892> Not just your companions but the people you're fighting too @WoolieVersus
[3:26:52] <+jiggy_snipe> tbf you're kinda a messed up person
[3:26:52] <+xddddsorandom> You're using them as a conduit
[3:26:53] <KaitlynnHere> That’s why you level up when you talk to them
[3:26:54] <+Deano8817> you use their force, but they're not losing theirs when you use it
[3:26:55] <%Irridium> you could probably take more if you wanted but that's dark-side style
[3:26:57] <lotharrio> Then you were present at Revan's "big clean up battle."
[3:26:57] <%GrassCannon> FORSONA!
[3:26:58] <Halospaz117> Light Side is more mutually beneficial
[3:26:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU'RE USING ECHOES OF THEIR POWER
[3:26:59] <%Starlight_Gamer> sharing force?
[3:27:01] <snakemuho> and droids don't give a shit
[3:27:02] <fuji_92> POWER OF BONDS WOOLIE PERSONA
[3:27:02] <+MidnightBurst12> signal boosting
[3:27:03] <%Gruhunchously> Even Light Side, it's still what's going on
[3:27:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Light Side is Persona.
[3:27:05] <boostergoldz> part of the point of why you're so scary to the council is also that any other jedi could've gone through the shit you went through and come out the same
[3:27:10] <+Exicuren> Social Links
[3:27:10] <ainda_> you're a big drain that the force flows through
[3:27:10] <+Kduff89> yeah phan Y'pak is just an smt protag
[3:27:12] <heartlesshealer> The true Force was the friends we made along the way!
[3:27:13] <derap41> You're bending the Force Trough the people following you
[3:27:14] <+krispen_wa> You're Akachi from NWN2: Mask of the Betrayer
[3:27:14] <+bear_breaker20> somehow HK is giving you force power through fwendship
[3:27:14] <Kivros> you have the force ozjerwise they couldn't cut you off
[3:27:15] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> I always took it as you and Kreia are feeding off of each other, or at least you're feeding off of her. And then the more people you meet the more you're feeding off of them
[3:27:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @RioGascar She only does to an extent. It's why her force powers affect you and vice versa
[3:27:17] <terramagus> Light side "borrows", Dark Side "takes"
[3:27:17] <%RioGascar> Its also how you are probably REGENING force points
[3:27:18] <+AsinPersuasion> also the connections of hundreds of dead people
[3:27:18] <fuji_92> LIGHT SIDE IS PERSONA
[3:27:19] <Monkeyweed21> its symbiotic if you're Light Side, parasitic if you're Dark Side @WoolieVersus
[3:27:20] <+jiggy_snipe> torrent seeds Kappa
[3:27:20] <jorniev> and out of everyone you kill woolie
[3:27:20] <%mar_krow> Face urself
[3:27:21] <+Kitafin> one for all
[3:27:21] <Xanax44> like how firebenders can redirect lightning
[3:27:21] <+EmotionalFatGuy> its more than a feeling. It's high on believing
[3:27:22] <+kekkerscrew> You're using their force
[3:27:23] <Zaku_III> No batteries - the Force is infinite.
[3:27:23] <derap41> Fucking Blood Bender
[3:27:23] <%Camail> but they want you to
[3:27:25] <+MagicBeanBurrito> they are conduits for you not batteries
[3:27:25] <fuji_92> DARK SIDE IS HUNGER
[3:27:27] <CrimsonGargoyle> @heartlesshealer LUL fo real
[3:27:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> You are a living star forge. You connect to them in such a way they are casting FOR you
[3:27:31] <dinnydanny777> Yes you are still crawling in your crawl
[3:27:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> They're acting like a hose for you
[3:27:33] <Halospaz117> Dark Side is Parasitic, Light Side is Symbiotic
[3:27:33] <ingman112> And everyone you kill gives you more
[3:27:39] <%mar_krow> Force bond bender
[3:27:42] <+Freeborg1997> @Camail They think they do
[3:27:43] <Kivros> you are like the force crystal
[3:27:46] <+WutangchickeN> you are the machines in the matrix
[3:27:46] <+Kyma1020> You are a conduit
[3:27:46] <keiji_maede> He's a star forge~
[3:27:47] <+bear_breaker20> Vampires are always empty inside by default
[3:27:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> You are casting from their batteries, but you're acting a conduit for them.
[3:27:48] <jbrachob> Pak´s real name is actually Rou Ter
[3:27:54] <+syn_draco> With each living thing you kill, you siphon off the force they had within them i.e. gain exp
[3:27:57] <dinnydanny777> Also these Jedi suck
[3:28:00] <CrimsonGargoyle> @jbrachob holy shit LUL hahahaha
[3:28:02] <Monkeyweed21> Light Side bonds are symbiotic, Dark Side Bonds are parasitic @WoolieVersus
[3:28:02] <derap41> So this isn't Parasitic its mutualism
[3:28:03] <+AsinPersuasion> their connections to the force
[3:28:03] <available_line> And Kreia was cut off, right?
[3:28:04] <dinnydanny777> What if they're just wrong?
[3:28:11] <grimwire1> yooo highlander style
[3:28:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> @jbrachob OH SHIT THATS GOOD
[3:28:12] <KaitlynnHere> Also kill these Jedi first
[3:28:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> TWO-WAY POWER BOOSTING, LIKE AN ECHO CHAMBER
[3:28:13] <%tealplague> LUL Rou Ter
[3:28:13] <furcifer93> It’s symbiotic, not parasitic like Hungryboy.
[3:28:14] <%Gruhunchously> When we kill people we're sucking the residual Force out of them
[3:28:14] <derap41> Nah that something else
[3:28:15] <MarkUriah> It is
[3:28:15] <Drunkengen> are you the DARK SOUL?
[3:28:16] <JanusII> And the chests your hack/break.
[3:28:16] <%Irridium> vaccu-SUCC
[3:28:18] <Halospaz117> That's the Wound in the Force stuff
[3:28:18] <DatAsuna> yes nihilus blocked her
[3:28:19] <%DSD24> That's Exiles own ability
[3:28:20] <jorniev> you killed A LOT of people
[3:28:22] <lotharrio> Or are you bonding to people right before you kill them?
[3:28:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Force SUUCK
[3:28:24] <fuji_92> Yeah, Light side is 2 way, Dark side is 1 way
[3:28:29] <Xanax44> but droids dont feel force, how do you get xp for killing droids?
[3:28:31] <dead_harmony13> rau-ter

[3:28:34] <derap41> You are a Force Vacuum
[3:28:34] <+MagicBeanBurrito> ewww
[3:28:36] <%Gruhunchously> You are a less aggresive Hungry Boy
[3:28:37] <+xShenzi> People around you are fans blowing wind at your windmill, and the more fans around you the more effective your windmill is
[3:28:37] <+syn_draco> You kno it
[3:28:40] <%mar_krow> Your lv will increase
[3:28:41] <%DSD24> You have been killing so many people Woolie

[3:28:41] <BurdRightsActivist> FORCE KIRBY
[3:28:45] <dinnydanny777> You have a passive force drain
[3:28:46] <ZeeJiggle> Hehehe

[3:28:51] <%RioGascar> You are also just regaining force points from sucking out the force from others
[3:28:52] <+bear_breaker20> killing people is a great bonding method okay
[3:28:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> Fanny Rau-Tur Pakk
[3:28:53] <%DSD24> "You made this? I made this"

[3:28:56] <dinnydanny777> Passive force syphon
[3:28:56] <derap41> You're eating those midoclolrians
[3:28:56] <%TubeMan642> You are a force Vampire
[3:28:56] <lotharrio> Remember the flashback cave? The whole conversation Malak had was trying to convince the Exile.
[3:28:57] <MarkUriah> @dinnydanny777 Yupyup
[3:28:57] <snakemuho> you're a cordless Force Vacuum and your companions are your batteries
[3:29:00] <+Deano8817> force SUCC
[3:29:02] <jorniev> A WOUND ON THE FORCE
[3:29:03] <Vicemond> that's a lot of SUCC
[3:29:05] <Monkeyweed21> You are a symbiotic version of Hungry Boi
[3:29:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> YEAAAAA
[3:29:06] <+WutangchickeN> I'm sucking from you
[3:29:07] <+Exicuren> All those siths you killed
[3:29:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> HE GETS IT
[3:29:07] <%HostilePoundcakes> Fucking wow NotLikeThis
[3:29:09] <heartlesshealer> You're both holding onto the force connection, you kill them and they let go
[3:29:10] <Halospaz117> They are not wrong when they say you're a Wound in the Force
[3:29:10] <Pistachius> all for one vs one for all?
[3:29:11] <Dementedpenguin> Highlander WutFace
[3:29:11] <dinnydanny777> Permanent passive force drain buff
[3:29:12] <+WutangchickeN> BIG SUCC 🤣
[3:29:13] <ShiningAxis> Fann must fight the hungry boy, but little did he know he was the hungry boy all along
[3:29:13] <Xchunkylover73x> FORCE KRIBY
[3:29:14] <+charmquarke> I hate you I'm going to kill you give me $20 0

[3:29:17] <+bear_breaker20> you are the great force hole
[3:29:21] <%mar_krow> You feel the sins crawling on your back
[3:29:22] <%Gruhunchously> Hungry Boy was at Malachor as well
[3:29:27] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus The Exile's real power was the Friends he made ALONG THE WAY.
[3:29:29] <+syn_draco> Long story short, Malachor V fucked up A LOT of stuff
[3:29:30] <MarkUriah> You are more controlled than Nihilus
[3:29:33] <Halospaz117> Nihlus is what you'd be on the Dark Side pretty much
[3:29:35] <derap41> You aren't as crazy
[3:29:35] <Parapattern> The Force would curb the sucking normally, but now it's replaced by an endless void
[3:29:38] <Monkeyweed21> You are a symbiotic version of Hungry Boi
[3:29:39] <%GraceTBM> you're just doing it with personal connections instead of by force
[3:29:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Light side is Symbiotic, Dark side is Parasitic.
[3:29:42] <cosmicgoatee> hmmm I wonder whyyy
[3:29:42] <%Irridium> and not on a planet-killing scale
[3:29:48] <dereks0n> BUT WHAT IF
[3:29:54] <+MidnightBurst12> symbiote vs parasite
[3:29:57] <austinj24> Fann Y'pak is literally the Woolie Hole
[3:29:58] <+HollowMan190> spoilers?
[3:30:01] <308caliber> this power makes you the biggest threat to the galaxy
[3:30:02] <lotharrio> Also true, you're not wiping out trees and shit.
[3:30:03] <GHouseduivel> And giving back as well
[3:30:06] <fuji_92> commander squeaks is right
[3:30:08] <a_mad_dragon> B E C O M E H U N G R Y
[3:30:08] <Make_me_mad> You're a wound in the force, a hole that the force of other things is falling into.
[3:30:09] <+bear_breaker20> and murder
[3:30:16] <lotharrio> Exile is also a specific super-weirdo.
[3:30:16] <derap41> You allso need that force bonding
[3:30:27] <Halospaz117> There is also the fact that Malachor was directly your fault
[3:30:30] <MarkUriah> Bao Dur went through it
[3:30:34] <dinnydanny777> We have the force bondage
[3:30:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> OTHER Jedi didn't get this, only you
[3:30:34] <KaitlynnHere> You become crusty boy
[3:30:39] <+AsinPersuasion> nihlus is that without the bond ability
[3:30:42] <%RioGascar> Exile is a symbiotic and nihilus is a parasite
[3:30:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wombo Combo
[3:30:47] <asurite_warrior> Look at the Girl from the first KOTOR for an example
[3:30:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> Most jedi use the force from within themselves to do their force casting. You use the universe's force
[3:30:49] <+bear_breaker20> guilt trip the player into becoming jesus or something
[3:30:51] <Xchunkylover73x> Force KRIBY
[3:30:52] <%mitchteck> wont cutting you off not work
[3:30:55] <+Kduff89> maybe an astral chain?
[3:30:56] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus The Exile and Hungry Boy went through the same thing. The Exile cut themselves off from the Froce, and Hungry Boy leaned into the wound and became an all-consuming black hole
[3:30:59] <+Exicuren> Astral Chain? Social Link? Kappa
[3:31:00] <ZeeJiggle> OoooOOOHH
[3:31:02] <derap41> He cut off
[3:31:05] <ZeeJiggle> My brain just exploded at that.
[3:31:05] <+syn_draco> So wait a minute, is the bond with Kreia actually special then?
[3:31:06] <Halospaz117> OH SHIT
[3:31:06] <308caliber> oh shit evo19MindBlown
[3:31:07] <lotharrio> Also why Bao Dur is super broken from the last war.
[3:31:09] <+krispen_wa> OH SNAP, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
[3:31:12] <terramagus> Oh shit, he's right.
[3:31:12] <Halospaz117> I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
[3:31:13] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Like how Vader is complicit in killing Alderaan, but he doesn't have the bond ability so he's not a vacuum in the force like you
[3:31:14] <%Takreth> evoMindBlown
[3:31:14] <TDAWS_MP132> I NEVER REALIZED
[3:31:14] <%HostilePoundcakes> OH FUCK DUDE PogChamp
[3:31:16] <+WutangchickeN> hungry boy is forcing it, but you are doing it subconsciously
[3:31:17] <+MidnightBurst12> oh shit
[3:31:17] <%shincadad> OH
[3:31:18] <snakemuho> elaWut
[3:31:19] <heartlesshealer> Bao does not have your Force Bond ability
[3:31:22] <chll0ne> wait
[3:31:22] <%ShadowArcangel> Also Kreia said in one of her conversations that she saw the death of the Force in you
[3:31:22] <witchwoodstock> i finished my mario maker world
[3:31:23] <%Irridium> your BOY
[3:31:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> WAIT WHAT
[3:31:23] <chll0ne> HUH
[3:31:24] <dinnydanny777> Bao Dor literally commited a war crime didn't he
[3:31:25] <Monkeyweed21> HE BUILT IT
[3:31:25] <GHouseduivel> Mandalore did too
[3:31:25] <Parapattern> Basically everyone has anchors around them and they are sinking into your bottomless ocean
[3:31:26] <+Reverend_Roscoe> OH FUCK
[3:31:27] <+syn_draco> I mean, the only difference here seems to be that Kreia knows how to invade minds & project visions
[3:31:28] <+kawachipto> he made the weapon
[3:31:28] <lotharrio> He felt all the shit you did, including all the people he killed.
[3:31:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> He MADE THE THING
[3:31:31] <Halospaz117> OH FUCK THAT'S A GOOD POINT
[3:31:32] <%Camail> he's a little baby wound
[3:31:33] <%Gruhunchously> HOLY SHIT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THAT
[3:31:34] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @SolidusRex
[3:31:36] <KaitlynnHere> @lotharrio probably because he made the bomb that destroyed a world... or something
[3:31:36] <+Reverend_Roscoe> HE'S A YOU
[3:31:38] <+MidnightBurst12> Bao pressed the button
[3:31:40] <derap41> While he is just off
[3:31:43] <chll0ne> OHHHH SHIT
[3:31:44] <Xanax44> @dinnydanny777 big war crimes for everyone
[3:31:44] <Space_Pagan> HOLY SHIT
[3:31:47] <+MagicBeanBurrito> formin a chain
[3:31:50] <derap41> Bao is just off
[3:31:57] <%DesertPenguin> We're still one this one choice wow
[3:32:01] <+krispen_wa> Holy fuck, that's crazy
[3:32:05] <dinnydanny777> You're basically the main character from Spec Ops all over again
[3:32:07] <%DSD24> Press 3!
[3:32:09] <%mitchteck> wouldn't cutting you off not work then?
[3:32:13] <heartlesshealer> Writing <3
[3:32:13] <ZeeJiggle> God this is such a cool story.
[3:32:14] <jorniev> THAT IS NUTS
[3:32:16] <Monkeyweed21> by feeding yourself, you're also feeding Bao Dur
[3:32:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mitchteck Yes
[3:32:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> So all of Bao-Dur's power is third-hand leeched from someone else and passed through you.
[3:32:18] <+theaceclaw> fix the audio
[3:32:18] <%christopherwpoindexter> Bao is bonded on a companion/thought level, Kreia is bonded to you by game mechanics
[3:32:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> It would not
[3:32:20] <GHouseduivel> Feel like a hero now?
[3:32:23] <%DesertPenguin> Para Ingles, primera tres
[3:32:25] <KaitlynnHere> So the force power bao durt has is coming from phanny?
[3:32:26] <+MidnightBurst12> this is why Kotor 2 is so good
[3:32:30] <KaitlynnHere> Dur
[3:32:31] <penitentpentwitch> Minus robots
[3:32:33] <Xchunkylover73x> MASS MIND BREAK COMBO
[3:32:36] <Halospaz117> GOD I LOVE THIS GAME
[3:32:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> The Exile is potentially stronger then any starwars character in existance while not being able to abuse their power if they lean into it
[3:32:37] <%mar_krow> Must digest this info
[3:32:37] <ZeeJiggle> Literally in game lore explanations for EXP
[3:32:41] <%Gruhunchously> Including droids, for some reason...but
[3:32:43] <+syn_draco> @mitchteck pretty much. Your connection is gone, but you can just connect again through other people
[3:32:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @theaceclaw they know the audio is fucked, it'll be fixed in the youtube
[3:32:47] <+kekkerscrew> Then how do droids give XP
[3:32:48] <GHouseduivel> triGalaxy
[3:32:48] <Scrub_Seeker> so does this mean nihilus is a vergil?
[3:32:51] <%Irridium> god I fucking wish this game got the dev time it needed
[3:32:51] <%ShadowArcangel> Life is a feast and you are one of the only ones that can consume it
[3:32:52] <derap41> Also this might be learnable
[3:32:53] <+krispen_wa> @doc_ock_rokc of course, until the Revan novel writers forget about it
[3:32:55] <$Invlux> @theaceclaw they can't fix audio without completely restarting the game
[3:32:55] <+bear_breaker20> @Gruhunchously shshshshshshsshshhhhh
[3:32:57] <jorniev> ANTI LIFE
[3:32:58] <dinnydanny777> The Jedi seem to like feeling in control
[3:32:58] <%GraceTBM> GraceTBM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! I played Kotor 2 multiple times as a kid, and twice with the restored content mod. I have seen so much more of this game and lots of incredible details in this lp. Thank you for exercizing the thoroughness you did, as frustrating as it can be at times
[3:32:58] <available_line> Doe that mean droids are connected to the force becasue they give us XP?
[3:32:59] <snakemuho> Bao Dur is the main character
[3:32:59] <witchwoodstock> droids are created by the electricty of that dark jedi
[3:33:04] <+JustToWatch> Woolie's gonna lose it when Sans shows up and just wrecks his shit
[3:33:05] <derap41> Force SUCC might be learned

[3:41:04] <dinnydanny777> That's exactly what they were about to do to YOU by the way
[3:41:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> These Jedi were so ingrained in the Force that they literally could not survive being cut off from it.
[3:41:08] <prince_johnny_> OH DAMN
[3:41:09] <derap41> oh no
[3:41:09] <deuxexgodzilla> Darth Nilus got to go!

[3:41:16] <heartlesshealer> hmmmm
[3:41:16] <Monkeyweed21> WHY IS T3 RED
[3:41:16] <+MidnightBurst12> literal soul eating
[3:41:17] <%jillpilled> Kavar was the only thing of value lost, but even then fuck him too for being dumb enough to suck up to Vrook

[3:41:27] <Halospaz117> GOD I LOVE THIS GAME
[3:41:27] <lotharrio> One that... echoes, echoes-echoes-echoes...
[3:41:32] <Zebroneath> V, please LUL
[3:41:32] <fuji_92> AN ECHO
[3:41:33] <lilredmage> I felt something in the force, as if a million stream viewers cried out "you get what you deserve, vrook" and then were suddenly satisfied
[3:41:33] <TDAWS_MP132> and Kreia is GONE GONE
[3:41:33] <+krispen_wa> Dustin Echoes
[3:41:33] <%HostilePoundcakes> BibleThump
[3:41:36] <dinnydanny777> Is Visas okay?
[3:41:37] <%DemonOfSalt> T3 is edited by KSE, don't worry guys.
[3:41:37] <subjectg> @candidateplays also that they are an absence in the force, and that kreia said to see the world through the eyes of the exile
[3:41:38] <%jillpilled> DRINK
[3:41:39] <KaitlynnHere> It’s empty
[3:41:41] <%Starlight_Gamer> are we NOW at endgame?
[3:41:44] <308caliber> an echo in the force BibleThump
[3:41:45] <boostergoldz> oh that's why they made the party menu a circle
[3:41:45] <%DesertPenguin> We drinking?
[3:41:46] <$StaceMcGate> no
[3:41:50] <RushUnplugged> remember all the things she said, and how it was ALL CRAP
[3:41:51] <KaitlynnHere> Welp. GG
[3:41:52] <%roobanguy> @Starlight_Gamer yes
[3:41:54] <Halospaz117> @dinnydanny777 Yeah Kreia just KO'd her
[3:41:54] <+theaceclaw> the fact that obsidian never got to make kotor 3 is so fucking depressing
[3:41:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> @starlight_gamer YUP
[3:41:55] <boostergoldz> how did I not see that before
[3:41:56] <BurdRightsActivist> ALIGNMENT: RIGHT.
[3:41:56] <%jillpilled> WHY DO WE HAVE TO DISAGREE THO
[3:42:00] <%DSD24> Vrook was so bad
[3:42:01] <%DesertPenguin> I'm lighting up some weed so there's that. This one's for you lol
[3:42:02] <subjectg> Now you understand how people are disappointed in the last jedi
[3:42:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> NEVER BEEN MORE RIGHT
[3:42:02] <$StaceMcGate> @Starlight_Gamer Imma say at least 9 hours left
[3:42:03] <GHouseduivel> Kreia did nothing wrong
[3:42:06] <+Estuko> @christopherwpoindexter LUL I was super gay for Visas first, small thing for handmaiden 2nd butn ot as significant, but then hard for kreia lmao
[3:42:06] <%DemonOfSalt> V, I AM OUT OF ALCOHOL RIGHT NOW
[3:42:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DesertPenguin We don't want to commit mass alchohol poisioning
[3:42:09] <RamenRiderZ> GRANNY KNOWS BEST
[3:42:09] <+krispen_wa> He went from going "Granny's kinda a bitch" to "I LOVE MY GRANNY"
[3:42:10] <Vicemond> middle of the climax ye ye
[3:42:12] <%Camail> it gets better
[3:42:14] <+warlockwithapixie> oh no
[3:42:14] <lotharrio> Also the council was right about the real threat still being in hiding.
[3:42:14] <GHouseduivel> In fact she did everything right
[3:42:14] <dinnydanny777> Vrook was literally going to do exactly what she did to them
[3:42:15] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> tip them up, pore one out
[3:42:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> MISSUS GREY CENTRIST ISN'T SO BAD
[3:42:17] <fuji_92> KREIA DID NOTHING WRONG
[3:42:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Granny said "BITCH DO NOT TOUCH MY BOY."
[3:42:23] <%Camail> i LOVE her character
[3:42:25] <+MidnightBurst12> SO WRONG YET SO RIGHT
[3:42:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Now you see why we say Last Jedi is SHIT
[3:42:29] <+kekkerscrew> Kreia told you the truth every time
[3:42:30] <snakemuho> And she still makes sense if you're Dark Side
[3:42:32] <cosmicgoatee> turns out it wasn't the Granny who was HOES MAD
[3:42:33] <%Gruhunchously> You sent it away three times
[3:42:34] <+xddddsorandom> THEY DIDNT EVEN ASK
[3:42:34] <dinnydanny777> Vrook was going to separate YOU from the force Woolie, those bodies would have been you
[3:42:39] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus Turns out they were right. The real threat was still hiding, waiting for them to gather together.
[3:42:46] <%Camail> we are the SURVIVOR and they want to kill you as a threat
[3:42:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> @estuko 👌🏻
[3:42:50] <+MidnightBurst12> Cowardice
[3:42:53] <dinnydanny777> Vrook was 100% dark side
[3:42:53] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:42:53] <308caliber> Kreia was 100% right, the masters fucked up big time
[3:42:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Exactly, it would have been murder by another name.
[3:42:58] <terramagus> Hoes might be mad, but bitches be dead
[3:42:58] <heartlesshealer> Cowardice and betrayal
[3:42:59] <+AsinPersuasion> she loves the shit out of you man

[3:47:48] <GHouseduivel> The council was going to kill the only hope they have against the sith, how fucking stupid
[3:47:49] <snakemuho> you should still check other Kreia dialogues in the cave, they're pretty fun

[3:49:19] <heartlesshealer> poyo
[3:49:19] <furcifer93> She didn’t even necessarily kill them, they were just so attached to the Force that they chose death than to be severed from it.
[3:49:25] <%alrobot2014> Metaknight was totally at malachor
[3:49:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @furcifer93 Preach
[3:49:31] <dinnydanny777> Did Kreia imply that Vrook drove Nihilus to the Dark side?
[3:49:32] <%jillpilled> Noooooo
[3:49:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> I bet we still got two more weeks left
[3:49:38] <Halospaz117> This is gonna be a long fucking week
[3:49:44] <KaitlynnHere> ....
[3:49:45] <snakemuho> @WoolieVersus game audio crackling in the background
[3:49:47] <KaitlynnHere> I quit
[3:49:47] <%christopherwpoindexter> yup, what a good place to finish, so glad we got at least to this
[3:49:50] <+Exicuren> Yes, best cliffhanger
[3:49:51] <+krispen_wa> @dinnydanny777 she implies vrook drove EVERYONE to the Dark side
[3:49:52] <DatAsuna> Also please close the game so w can be spared the audio in the background
[3:49:52] <+syn_draco> @furcifer93 force suicide instead of feeling the death of an entire planet full of jedi/sith
[3:49:55] <+bear_breaker20> MetaKnight WISHES he was at malachor
[3:49:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1268068275423981569?s=20
[3:49:58] <%jillpilled> it'll be a super long wait but good cliffhanger
[3:49:58] <%Irridium> Star Lifting sounds fucking rad
[3:50:01] <FoolproofDread> I approve.
[3:50:05] <ingman112> Vrook and Jedi like him
[3:50:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> too bad, because the song is amazing tho
[3:50:13] <$StaceMcGate> Please close the game, the sputtering audio is interrupting you
[3:50:13] <Monkeyweed21> Dyson sphere is basically making a planetoid of solar panels
[3:50:14] <InvisibleMan101> and finally, Woolie has figured it out.
[3:50:15] <+MidnightBurst12> eat that sun for more tanks
[3:50:16] <%Camail> dyson sphere is about energy, this seems to be about minerals and metals?
[3:50:20] <%Camail> (sp)
[3:50:20] <StarlitStunner> Halo Rings
[3:50:20] <falineth> a star lifter is more about mining matter from a sun
[3:50:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 No Vrook made jedi more dogmatic which undid Kreias weird philosiphy
[3:50:22] <lotharrio> I'll stop saying it after this, but @WoolieVersus guess what? The Jedi were right. The real threat was hiding in the shadows, waiting for them to gather all along.
[3:50:26] <dinnydanny777> Yeah, still not getting how Kreia was the villain there when Vrook was literally being super evil
[3:50:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dyson Sphere is all solar panels. Starlifting pulls material out of a star.
[3:50:38] <%RioGascar> dyson sphere is so fucking cool BUT MAN WE ARE NOT GETTING THAT TECH EVER
[3:50:41] <Chatterbox1991> PLEASE DO A PODCAST SPOILERCAST
[3:50:47] <+syn_draco> Say, didn't Revan have an ability called Drain Force/Life in KOTOR 1...
[3:50:48] <+krispen_wa> @dinnydanny777 she's not the villain here at all.
[3:50:51] <DatAsuna> But also he bet is that pat thinks it's really her @WoolieVersus
[3:50:56] <fuji_92> LUL
[3:50:57] <+Kduff89> ooh boi I hear the crusty audio now. I dont even have headphones in
[3:51:04] <MarkUriah> That is the moral of Malachor
[3:51:06] <floornine> Woolie I saw a house hippo running by your figurines
[3:51:17] <$StaceMcGate> @Chatterbox1991 that'll be at least two weeks from now, he still has at least 8 hours of game left.
[3:51:19] <+Kduff89> Johns orchestra is having a stroke
[3:51:28] <%RioGascar> As a kid i choose neither side cause i didnt wanna fight either
[3:51:28] <Halospaz117> I don't think any of us thought of it
[3:51:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bao MADE the weapon
[3:51:35] <+krispen_wa> V had that revelation right here with that big-ass brain of his
[3:51:37] <+bear_breaker20> so Apathy is Death, works for both jedi and sith
[3:51:38] <DatAsuna> It's kind of his entire character though lol
[3:51:41] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Bao was just following orders
[3:51:45] <$StaceMcGate> Please close the game LUL
[3:51:46] <boostergoldz> bao just said he destroyed planets for you
[3:51:51] <+AsinPersuasion> you survived the bestest
[3:51:51] <+MidnightBurst12> Bao made the weapon and turned it on
[3:51:56] <+AsinPersuasion> No
[3:52:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @MidnightBurst12 Exactly
[3:52:01] <%jillpilled> last of like 12 jedi, now 9 LUL
[3:52:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> No
[3:52:02] <+AsinPersuasion> youre better for it
[3:52:03] <subjectg> Every single party member was, at some point, affected by malacho
[3:52:06] <%roobanguy> at Visas's planet
[3:52:08] <GHouseduivel> Bao's words were literal, not metaphorical
[3:52:12] <+thebadpope> The game's audio sounds distorted.
[3:52:12] <+krispen_wa> SUCC
[3:52:17] <+AsinPersuasion> the exile is not worse off but better off
[3:52:18] <%correctedsun117> CRUNCHY
[3:52:19] <DatAsuna> nope, katarr was different
[3:52:20] <%roobanguy> An Echo of Malachor
[3:52:22] <dinnydanny777> So at some point you and Nihilus were on the same side
[3:52:26] <+MidnightBurst12> BIG SUCC
[3:52:27] <+krispen_wa> DRINK
[3:52:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> No Nilahus was at malachador
[3:52:29] <TDAWS_MP132> SHOTS
[3:52:29] <lotharrio> Effectively similar. Or.. an intentionally similar event.
[3:52:32] <+theaceclaw> Nihlus is basically a manifestation of all the pain and suffering at Malachor
[3:52:33] <DatAsuna> but it was also planetary destruction
[3:52:33] <%therabbles> DRINK
[3:52:35] <i_am_therydon> stop the game please the stuttering is too much
[3:52:38] <Captainflipsy> my dude, that audio k w i s p y
[3:52:39] <%jillpilled> V stop making them drink D:
[3:52:40] <+syn_draco> Vacuum go Vroooooooom
[3:52:41] <KaitlynnHere> Not exaaactly the same
[3:52:43] <dinnydanny777> At some point you, Krusty Boy and Nihilus were all on the same side, fighting together
[3:52:45] <prince_johnny_> APATHY IS DEATH
[3:52:50] <%RioGascar> Are you even a jedi if you don’t actually have a connection to the force and instead drain and give it back???
[3:52:56] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Katarr and Malachor are different
[3:53:03] <KaitlynnHere> Apathy is dying on the toilet
[3:53:03] <+krispen_wa> KOTOR II is really fucking dumb with the missable content
[3:53:06] <KnivesEve> mute game
[3:53:06] <+MidnightBurst12> E C H O E S
[3:53:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> You miss one of the game's fucking THESIS STATEMENTS
[3:53:11] <terramagus> Give yourself the Ring of the Abyss and get into that Sith Cave, god dammit
[3:53:11] <snakemuho> 1.1 year
[3:53:20] <%CyanDeadEye> This is why KoTOR 2 is so replayable
[3:53:28] <+MidnightBurst12> This game is too good
[3:53:35] <prince_johnny_> @krispen_wa exactly no wonder ppl think kotor 1 is better
[3:53:40] <%roobanguy> im glad that he reloaded that shit with kreia
[3:53:40] <+syn_draco> @jiggy_snipe Well Malachor had a ton of people die there, and Katarr got the huge succ
[3:53:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> you wouldn't know about Atton's history, HK's deal...
[3:54:03] <+theaceclaw> imagine if t3 could use forces powers lol
[3:54:07] <snakemuho> MrDestructoid that music
[3:54:12] <DatAsuna> He was meant to be a sith assassin already but oh well
[3:54:12] <%jillpilled> my armor!
[3:54:13] <+theaceclaw> fann'y snacc
[3:54:15] <%therabbles> i remember trying to make HK a jedi with the save editor and it didn't work out
[3:54:25] <+jiggy_snipe> their personality quirks also affect it probably
[3:54:25] <+krispen_wa> Nah, she just likes your giant slapping ass cheeks
[3:54:33] <+MidnightBurst12> She already seems codependant from the start
[3:54:36] <dinnydanny777> I wonder if Vrook would even show up as being blue
[3:54:40] <%christopherwpoindexter> 🍻
[3:54:40] <terramagus> HK as a Jedi just uninstalls the game once manifesting
[3:54:50] <KaitlynnHere> @krispen_wa they even clap when fanny walks
[3:55:03] <prime_name> I would say we are there
[3:55:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little V, do you think that in that event, Vrook had fallen to the dark side?
[3:55:25] <Halospaz117> oh yeaaaaaah
[3:55:33] <+ntfth> You should look into the old EU's Yuuzhan Vong a bit, they're similar to what went on here.
[3:55:34] <+MidnightBurst12> yep
[3:55:36] <jorniev> COOO
[3:55:38] <DatAsuna> AND that's why she's level 6
[3:55:42] <Monkeyweed21> The basic deal is that Light Side Bonds are symbiotic, making characters stronger and better, while Dark Side Bonds are parasitic, draining and corrupting others
[3:55:45] <prince_johnny_> Oh damn
[3:55:45] <$StaceMcGate> @CommanderSqueaks Vrook is barely light side if you look at him with Force Alignment vision
[3:55:55] <+SinisterBroccoli> She's an exile of both
[3:56:00] <%Irridium> I always took it as Nihilus eating her force
[3:56:02] <+jiggy_snipe> mutualistic
[3:56:03] <+MidnightBurst12> from one exile to another
[3:56:07] <terramagus> Nah, Exile is an exile of the Sith too. What no I'm not Atris
[3:56:13] <KaitlynnHere> She had to endure... unspeakable things
[3:56:15] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> But now she strong AF
[3:56:22] <Monkeyweed21> You restored her powers by symbiotically feeding off each other
[3:56:33] <+MidnightBurst12> wierd
[3:56:33] <%ShadowArcangel> I've made the argument before that Kreia theoretically could be seen as the main character of this game
[3:56:35] <MarkUriah> Took
[3:56:36] <KaitlynnHere> What’s Atris then?
[3:56:37] <+krispen_wa> He ate it
[3:56:39] <hellkhat> BOTH A MASTER AND A STUDENT
[3:56:39] <%DesertPenguin> Fuck I just went to find my glasses and I think they fell out of my pocket when I was out protesting. Shit....
[3:56:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> you could turn on this music on YouTube instead so it isn't crunchy but still the same,song
[3:56:46] <lotharrio> You're alive, so you have the Force. It's just a weird, mutilated form of it.
[3:56:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> Nihlus took it from her
[3:56:58] <%DSD24> Wasn't Kreia a corpse? until you met her
[3:56:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:56:59] <dinnydanny777> That's why she had no force powers at the start
[3:57:01] <MarkUriah> Which is why she loves u
[3:57:04] <ingman112> I always took it as he cut her off and she had to work back up to it
[3:57:04] <%alrobot2014> and that's why your buffs effect each other
[3:57:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 Oh shit
[3:57:09] <HairyRavioliToad> That... sounds dumb and wrong NotLikeThis
[3:57:09] <+jiggy_snipe> remember the force is everywhere
[3:57:10] <dinnydanny777> It's why she was a low level
[3:57:16] <lotharrio> It's like losing a limb.
[3:57:16] <DatAsuna> Actually it's the opposite of why she loves you
[3:57:33] <+krispen_wa> wait what
[3:57:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> You are using the universe's force NOT YOURS
[3:57:37] <%Camail> hmmmmmm
[3:57:39] <Monkeyweed21> You and Kreia feed symbiotically from each other and the party to restore your powers
[3:57:40] <MarkUriah> @DatAsuna Et Tu
[3:57:43] <NirvashTypeMQ> tenchiTogether tenchiForever = tenchiSad
[3:57:45] <lilredmage> NotLikeThis
[3:57:47] <DatAsuna> You have force to give but you can't use it yourself
[3:57:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> The total is not the sum of its parts.
[3:57:48] <%Camail> i honestly think the bonds themselves have force
[3:57:53] <+MidnightBurst12> this choppy audio un the background is hilarious
[3:57:55] <+ggbhtg> Phantom Force Vibrations? @woolieversus
[3:57:55] <RushUnplugged> it can't be GONE if you're alive, the force is literally in everything. but the echo, reverbering through each other, amplifies it until both can use it again
[3:57:59] <Xanax44> kreia is a wifi hotspot
[3:57:59] <+AMaidIndeed> @NirvashTypeMQ D:
[3:58:03] <$Invlux> They can't use their own, but they can use each other's
[3:58:04] <privatesargent> the force is not a internal battery
[3:58:08] <+jiggy_snipe> the force is literally everyone
[3:58:10] <+krispen_wa> wut
[3:58:11] <+ntfth> IIRC Kreia isn't as stripped of the Force as the Exile because she didn't willingly turn away from it.
[3:58:13] <lotharrio> Being cut off doesn't mean you don't have a connection to it.
[3:58:13] <+SinisterBroccoli> I think they're both syphoning from others TOGETHER
[3:58:13] <%Camail> they both draw force from the bond, imo
[3:58:15] <jorniev> JERIA IS LIKE AN ANTENA FOR YOU
[3:58:17] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> The force is still technically in them as they live, but they aren't "force sensitive" until they meet each other and start feeding off one another's life foce
[3:58:18] <NirvashTypeMQ> tenchiEZ @AMaidIndeed
[3:58:20] <+jiggy_snipe> if its not there you are dead or super dead whatever
[3:58:21] <MarkUriah> The force is in your body still
[3:58:23] <DatAsuna> You're an infinite reflection off of each other basically
[3:58:23] <+syn_draco> Didn't they gain some exp first? A lot of dead/dying miners were still around on Peragus when they met
[3:58:23] <TDAWS_MP132> the force is not internal, it flows through everything and everyone
[3:58:24] <+jiggy_snipe> or a droid
[3:58:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> She feels it through you, you feel it through her.
[3:58:25] <lotharrio> It's like phantom limb syndrome.
[3:58:27] <+Ancopro> force still in you but you cant feel it in yourself
[3:58:27] <+RowenCleric> its like being blind, you can see everything... but its all still there
[3:58:27] <Monkeyweed21> you have it still, you just cant use it
[3:58:28] <terramagus> A points to B, X points to Y, but now they don't, so A points to Y, and X points to B
[3:58:29] <%tealplague> it's kinda like a two person key
[3:58:31] <+Kitafin> your chakras are sealed off
[3:58:33] <lotharrio> Or object permanence.
[3:58:39] <%DSD24> Candalore
[3:58:39] <%correctedsun117> Candalore!
[3:58:41] <asylumkon> i think of it like there is a faucet that connects the two and they get the force fron that
[3:58:42] <%GraceTBM> an airbender who loses airbending still breathes
[3:58:43] <GHouseduivel> Candalore
[3:58:43] <+JustToWatch> People don't actually have any amount of force in them, it's like saying you have gravity in you
[3:58:45] <DatAsuna> You see himw ith force sight
[3:58:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> You are using another's eyes to see but you can not see yourself
[3:58:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> They symbiotically borrow what the other isn't using
[3:58:52] <ZeeJiggle> Forgot your password. Darn.
[3:58:57] <%DSD24> Force Ad Break
[3:58:57] <%RioGascar> You cant feel pain, but it does not MEAN the pain is not happening
[3:58:58] <%DesertPenguin> Goku still has S Cells even when he's not super saiyan
[3:58:59] <dinnydanny777> Surely Mandalore is dark side though
[3:59:01] <lilredmage> and midichlorians fit in ...somewhere
[3:59:05] <DatAsuna> I'm glad I brought that up lol
[3:59:17] <+jiggy_snipe> @GraceTBM great analogy
[3:59:31] <MarkUriah> Its like Madarra power ups. Shit just got out of control with thee Exile
[3:59:33] <Monkeyweed21> its a symbiotic bond circlejerk
[3:59:35] <%RioGascar> Some people can not feel pain for example, BUT THERE IS STILL PAIN being experienced
[3:59:36] <DatAsuna> This conversation should probably be in the LP tbh
[3:59:37] <+jiggy_snipe> the force is just air pretty much and force sensitive peple can air bend
[3:59:38] <supergoblinpunch> someone stole you're wireless key to the force
[3:59:38] <+MidnightBurst12> the force is life. you're still connected but you are deaf to it on your own
[3:59:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> You "have" as much Force as the game lets you, but not all of it, or every possible use
[3:59:47] <%DemonOfSalt> Woolie, it's like both of you have disconnected ears but are simultaneously able to access each other's ears.
[3:59:52] <DatAsuna> All kill, no turn
[3:59:57] <DatAsuna> the turn came after
[4:00:02] <fuji_92> IT'S PERSONA WOOLIE BONDS = POWER LUL
[4:00:10] <DatAsuna> you get turned by sensing how fucked up it was
[4:00:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @fuji_92 Not actually wrong
[4:00:12] <GHouseduivel> A gap where there was once life
[4:00:14] <%DSD24> Don't forget that Fann has killed at least 500 people
[4:00:14] <lotharrio> Ground Zero was death. The people involved in the peripheral, got turned, or gave up.
[4:00:16] <+WutangchickeN> woolz, you and v have Netflix accounts. you can't remember your login, but you remember V's, and vice versa
[4:00:33] <frostiifae> ^ LUL
[4:00:36] <frostiifae> i'm loving all of these analogies
[4:00:38] <dinnydanny777> Was crusty boy a Jedi?
[4:00:38] <+bear_breaker20> I cant Belive George Lucas is responsible for Shin Megami Tensai
[4:00:39] <+krispen_wa> Forced Bonds
[4:00:39] <+MidnightBurst12> turning happened to those in orbit of the planing
[4:00:41] <Monkeyweed21> you are Spirit bombing their force powrs
[4:00:44] <KaitlynnHere> Can we turn off the game audio? It’s still crunchy
[4:00:46] <+ggbhtg> The Forced Broken Bond
[4:00:53] <%Irridium> @WutangchickeN fuck that's good
[4:00:54] <dinnydanny777> Wait was Crusty Boy a Jedi who only stayed alive through anger?
[4:00:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bao is cut off, too.
[4:00:55] <+Freeborg1997> @lotharrio No, that's apathy. LUL
[4:00:55] <+ggbhtg> @kaitlynnhere PUH LEASE
[4:00:56] <deuxexgodzilla> Fanny be a Kiburr crystal. scraping off the top
[4:00:56] <snakemuho> @KaitlynnHere it's adding to the mood
[4:01:01] <prime_name> Forever Audio crunch
[4:01:18] <KaitlynnHere> It’s broken, like fanny
[4:01:18] <%Camail> they can dock
[4:01:22] <MarkUriah> He might as well be a regular Jedi for mechanical purposes
[4:01:22] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:01:23] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> @dinnydanny777 All of the Sith in the games were at some point. That's not the full story, but all the Sith in KOTOR 1 & 2 are fallen Jedi. I won't spoil more
[4:01:24] <%alrobot2014> it sure is
[4:01:27] <+WutangchickeN> @irridium I try my dude carciGator
[4:01:28] <%correctedsun117> LUL
[4:01:28] <dinnydanny777> Was Crusty Boy actually a good guy who was turned by Malachor?
[4:01:32] <%GraceTBM> bao dur had a different experience: Like a deaf person who wasn't taught to hear went through a sonic boom
[4:01:33] <+SinisterBroccoli> AT LAST WE COULD HEAR
[4:01:34] <snakemuho> nooo the drama
[4:01:34] <Monkeyweed21> Its like the spirit bomb basically
[4:01:36] <DatAsuna> yeah and it's crunchier than sion
[4:01:36] <%DemonOfSalt> Thanks Woolie and V.
[4:01:37] <%Camail> that's cool
[4:01:38] <deuxexgodzilla> Thank you Woolie and V
[4:01:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's also how people who were only mildly Force Sensitive can become full fledged Jedi/Sith in the span of DAYS.
[4:01:39] <prince_johnny_> Thank god
[4:01:40] <ZeeJiggle> Super understandable
[4:01:40] <KaitlynnHere> Danks
[4:01:41] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> we figured
[4:01:42] <DatAsuna> yeah naturally
[4:01:42] <GHouseduivel> Thanks
[4:01:43] <+MidnightBurst12> it's fine
[4:01:43] <%Camail> s'all good
[4:01:43] <prime_name> You were trapped, no problem
[4:01:45] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> All good
[4:01:47] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus Exile got messed up by Malachor because he was Force bound to a bunch of people who got super murdered by Bao. Bao got messed up because he was bound to the Exile at the time he got messed up.
[4:01:47] <%christopherwpoindexter> @sinisterbroccoli AT LAST WE SAW
[4:01:48] <frostiifae> it'll be fine in the anime!!!
[4:01:49] <+ggbhtg> KONO BAN KIMI WA
[4:01:52] <DatAsuna> glad the anime is safe
[4:01:59] <YakumoYomi> No, I need the crunch in my anime
[4:01:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> TehePelo
[4:01:59] <snakemuho> We were deaf. We heard.
[4:02:02] <%yeildingthought> I liked the music though LUL
[4:02:08] <Xanax44> i hope this chat is in the anime
[4:02:08] <subjectg> just a question: is the audio only on our side?
[4:02:15] <MarkUriah> She sneaks up on people
[4:02:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> Also even droids are influenced by you!!!
[4:02:21] <KnivesEve> is the game audio off now? i unfortunately had to mute it cause it was giving me a headache
[4:02:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's also how people who were only mildly Force Sensitive can become full fledged Jedi/Sith in the span of DAYS. You can basically become a Jedi/Sith factory. You could have possibly replenished the entire Jedi population in no time of the Council weren't fucking MORONS>
[4:02:26] <DatAsuna> Well she is ALSO hiding herself from their eyeballs as well @WoolieVersus
[4:02:27] <%Irridium> @subjectg audio problem is on our side yes, for them it's fine
[4:02:28] <dinnydanny777> You mean the cutscene where she gets choke slammed into a wall?
[4:02:36] <KaitlynnHere> @kniveseve yeah they turn it off
[4:02:40] <terramagus> The defense is to bring a gun
[4:02:43] <+MidnightBurst12> yep
[4:02:47] <DatAsuna> She's literally invisible to their eyes not just force sense
[4:02:51] <subjectg> @irridium good, the experience wasn’t ruined for them at least
[4:02:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> The masters cutting you off would have done NOTHING
[4:02:55] <%Camail> cant double kill me
[4:02:55] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> No defense to a choke slam either, Granny
[4:02:55] <%ShadowArcangel> hmmm
[4:03:07] <GHouseduivel> @gandalfsmagicgaydick LUL
[4:03:11] <Monkeyweed21> Only counter is someone coming in for the assist
[4:03:16] <+MidnightBurst12> if you're already empty you can't be drained
[4:03:16] <MarkUriah> Gravity related shenanigans
[4:03:19] <deuxexgodzilla> and she just nommed three jedi masters. She getting a buff boost
[4:03:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fann'Y'Pak is Give and Take, Hungry Boy is Take and Take... and taketaketaketaketake
[4:03:21] <%Camail> revan wanted it to happen
[4:03:25] <+Freeborg1997> @DatAsuna Oh, is that what Zez-Kai Ell meant when he said, "she is difficult to see"?
[4:03:26] <supergoblinpunch> So glad I caught the reveal
[4:03:27] <+AsinPersuasion> nah shes only functionally invisible causs thr jedi are so used to force assisted sight
[4:03:31] <dinnydanny777> I fully understand why Revan ditched Vrook
[4:03:33] <lilredmage> the important thing, after all of this and all of these theories, is that vrook is dead
[4:03:34] <lotharrio> Revan let the disloyal, non-Sith elements of his army go to Malachor.
[4:03:34] <KnivesEve> oh nice. sucks i missed much of the convo but whatevs
[4:03:35] <snakemuho> and she also said "He can't kill what he can't see" about Sion back on Peragus before fighting him @WoolieVersus
[4:03:35] <+krispen_wa> Revan was nearby wasn't he? Killing Mandalore
[4:03:38] <%GraceTBM> @gandalfsmagicgaydick the strongest force technique is the piledriver
[4:03:40] <DatAsuna> Revan only planned the planet part, the rest was an accident
[4:03:53] <GHouseduivel> Revan was right place right time
[4:03:54] <dinnydanny777> I now completely understand Revan's decision to ditch this terrible, terrible Jedi council
[4:03:57] <+AsinPersuasion> its like they arent actually using their eyes
[4:04:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> No
[4:04:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:04:07] <DatAsuna> Revan had it like 30% planned but still got surprised @WoolieVersus
[4:04:09] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> Revan's foresight is better than anyone else's
[4:04:11] <+AsinPersuasion> or half assedly using their eyes
[4:04:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bao MADE THE BOMB.
[4:04:18] <jorniev> and revan then sends you to the council to fuck with them
[4:04:21] <fuji_92> Bao pushed a button
[4:04:29] <+MidnightBurst12> Bao built and dropped the nuke
[4:04:37] <%roobanguy> i personally dont think that reven intended for this to happen
[4:04:39] <MarkUriah> I don't remember but my headcanon is that Revan saw Nihilus and said fuck that
[4:04:46] <+krispen_wa> if revan was so smart, why did he keep Malak's dumbass as second in command?
[4:04:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> night owls represent
[4:04:50] <Halospaz117> NO, TALK FOREVER
[4:04:52] <DatAsuna> Nihilus is just an accident
[4:04:52] <dinnydanny777> If these are the types of people who were on the Jedi council I understand Revan's decision to leave them
[4:04:53] <subjectg> there are dark places in the galaxy, ancient centers of learning, of knowledge...
[4:04:57] <%DemonOfSalt> TALK FOREVER
[4:04:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Nihilus is a product of Malicore V
[4:05:01] <MarkUriah> Talk till next weeek
[4:05:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> talk as much as you want to
[4:05:03] <+jiggy_snipe> @MarkUriah I like that
[4:05:04] <%DSD24> Clap clap clap TALK FOREVER
[4:05:06] <lilredmage> @krispen_wa you want your number 2 to be kinda dumb
[4:05:09] <redambr> KEEP TALKING PLEASE
[4:05:12] <%roobanguy> he was trying to convert people to his side, this whole technique was an accident that fan ny'pak caused
[4:05:13] <+ggbhtg> TALK FOREVER! Clap x 5
[4:05:16] <Safarihat> @krispen_wa to let him power the starforge for her
[4:05:20] <Space_Pagan> TALK FOREVER
[4:05:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> He vores the Force.
[4:05:28] <%christopherwpoindexter> i live bish
[4:05:33] <+MidnightBurst12> Nihilus is 5lthe other path you could have gone down
[4:05:33] <%gatorafan> I feel like the guys also want to reserve some talk for the anime
[4:05:35] <dinnydanny777> Oh hey, remember Revan left the council because of their "cowardice"?
[4:05:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Jedi were so DEPENDENT on the Force that being cut off kills them
[4:05:49] <lotharrio> Well the Council has it as a threat to disloyal Jedi.
[4:05:49] <Halospaz117> I think a big part of it was that the council had become over-reliant on the force, so they just died outright from being cut off
[4:05:50] <dinnydanny777> Revan literally left the Jedi council because they were cowards
[4:05:50] <%christopherwpoindexter> I imagine....
[4:05:54] <+kralec> @WoolieVersus this is vastly more interesting than THOUSANDS of other streams.. evidence, i'm still here! rooAww
[4:05:57] <Monkeyweed21> its a hard counter to Jedi and Sith and does jack shit otherwise
[4:05:59] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kreia cut them off from the force. Jedi ether survive and become stronger or die....
[4:06:03] <KaitlynnHere> I thought you had to experience to learn it
[4:06:03] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus on the dark side if you kill the council emmebrs on first encounters kreia teaches you to learn attacks that are used on you
[4:06:07] <heartlesshealer> It kills those who deeply rely on it
[4:06:09] <%BisoromiBear> Force Slurp
[4:06:09] <boostergoldz> keep in mind that kreia was also once revan's teacher
[4:06:10] <+AsinPersuasion> keep in mind the difference between you and kreaia is that you did it to yourself
[4:06:18] <+AsinPersuasion> thats super important
[4:06:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> lights 👀
[4:06:20] <%DSD24> It won't kill them but it will give them plenty to think about
[4:06:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> It also does more damage to you the more reliant you are on the Force.
[4:06:25] <dinnydanny777> Revan leaving the Jedi council because they were massive cowards makes a lot more sense after talking to Vrook doesn't it
[4:06:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you use the Force as a crutch, it fucks you.
[4:06:34] <+MidnightBurst12> their lack of bonds to others made it so that losing the force was a death sentence
[4:06:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> And SO DO YOU
[4:06:42] <308caliber> death of the force monkaS
[4:06:42] <+syn_draco> Again. Vacuum go vroooooooom
[4:06:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> V SAID THE THING
[4:06:46] <GHouseduivel> ERASED
[4:06:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> V FINALLY SAID THE THING
[4:06:50] <jorniev> what is a jedi without the force... corpse nothing
[4:06:54] <MarkUriah> Photoshop your life away
[4:06:55] <snakemuho> and also all those Execution Points
[4:06:55] <Monkeyweed21> Its stronger the more force sensitive you are
[4:06:56] <dinnydanny777> Revan probably had the exact same conversation we just had with Vrook by the way
[4:06:56] <%DemonOfSalt> FORCE FUCK THE FORCE
[4:06:57] <+MidnightBurst12> something
[4:06:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> V IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY THAT YOU FINALLY SAID THE THING
[4:06:57] <Space_Pagan> YEYEYEYE
[4:07:00] <heartlesshealer> The ability works like Grass Knot from Pokemon
[4:07:10] <+WutangchickeN> but which character gets a devil trigger?
[4:07:12] <%DemonOfSalt> FORCE ANTIFORCE
[4:07:14] <+miyoles> Anti-force
[4:07:18] <Warfey> Force Delete
[4:07:18] <%alrobot2014> its a hell of a gamble
[4:07:23] <lotharrio> Mega Murdered you out from Force-heaven.
[4:07:31] <+krispen_wa> Force (Nothing)
[4:07:31] <dinnydanny777> Revan turned to the dark side because he had a conversation that went almost exactly like this with the Jedi council
[4:07:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> EVERYONE IS RIGHT
[4:07:32] <+JustToWatch> you don't get the ghost floating up to heaven
[4:07:34] <+MidnightBurst12> fucking terrifying
[4:07:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> But no one is right
[4:07:36] <GHouseduivel> You arn't killed, you are Erased
[4:07:38] <%DSD24> Yeah but Vrook was a dick
[4:07:44] <+AsinPersuasion> you cut yourself out of the chance of force heaven
[4:07:48] <+MidnightBurst12> they were justified
[4:07:48] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus Remember the excuse they had for not trying to solve things?
[4:07:49] <%alrobot2014> and revan sent you back to them fucking laughing the whole time probably
[4:07:50] <%DesertPenguin> Were those guys dead no matter what?
[4:07:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> Everyone is right, nobody is correct
[4:07:57] <+jiggy_snipe> they could have used you but they were dumb
[4:08:03] <GHouseduivel> @DesertPenguin Because they relied on the force so much, yes
[4:08:07] <%DSD24> @DesertPenguin I mean if you are Dark Side you kill them yourself
[4:08:07] <snakemuho> @DesertPenguin pretty much
[4:08:08] <DatAsuna> Vrook was only half wrong
[4:08:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna Right problem, wrong person.
[4:08:18] <%DesertPenguin> But I mean no options results in them living, right?
[4:08:20] <+krispen_wa> Wait holy fuck, they can actually KILL HEAVEN in this universe
[4:08:23] <asylumkon> i mean the council was totally right by saying you would attract the enemy to them
[4:08:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DesertPenguin They are literally too stupid to live.
[4:08:30] <%DesertPenguin> Ha
[4:08:30] <dinnydanny777> Revan literally started the war because the Jedi council were cowards who were refusing to act, which is exactly the same as the conversation we just had with Vrook
[4:08:36] <snakemuho> @DesertPenguin they chose apathy
[4:08:45] <%DesertPenguin> It was inevitevitevitable
[4:08:46] <lotharrio> The council were assholes, but they were... sort of right, unfortunately.
[4:08:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @krispen_wa And Hell.
[4:08:52] <%DemonOfSalt> Force Anti-Heaven
[4:08:59] <fuji_92> you're actually nothing, you die without it because you're so dependent on it
[4:09:01] <%HostilePoundcakes> as he deserves
[4:09:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lotharrio They understood the problem, they just pinned it on the wrong person.
[4:09:03] <+SinisterBroccoli> Vrook didn't.
[4:09:04] <Halospaz117> FORCE NOTHING
[4:09:04] <Space_Pagan> im gonna miss Kavar
[4:09:05] <dinnydanny777> Vrook gets to hang out with Exdeath
[4:09:06] <+jiggy_snipe> he went nowhere, he doesn't exist anymore
[4:09:07] <+ggbhtg> say hi to Ex Death
[4:09:08] <+AsinPersuasion> annihilation
[4:09:08] <DatAsuna> vrook didn't tell rey shit
[4:09:10] <%correctedsun117> Wow, that's actually horrifying
[4:09:10] <heartlesshealer> Vrook became an [object]
[4:09:11] <308caliber> banished to the shadow realm
[4:09:11] <+kralec> ERASED FROM EXISTENCE rooH
[4:09:12] <+MidnightBurst12> Emptiness
[4:09:12] <%bread_assassin> Vrook is gone for good? Sweet.
[4:09:15] <%therabbles> Vrook who?
[4:09:17] <MarkUriah> Not even the VOID. They got _____
[4:09:18] <KaitlynnHere> Nothing(nothing)
[4:09:19] <Halospaz117> oh yeah fuck that guy
[4:09:20] <jorniev> KREIA WANT TO KILL HEAVEN
[4:09:24] <penitentpentwitch> "I send you to Atheist Afterlife!" "You mean Hell!?" "I mean NOTHING!"
[4:09:26] <dinnydanny777> They were gonna kill you tho
[4:09:29] <%therabbles> the existence formerly known as Vrook
[4:09:29] <Space_Pagan> Good riddance to Vrook
[4:09:29] <%Irridium> other two probably didn't deserve it but Vrook, yeah that bitch deserved it
[4:09:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> They were complicit.
[4:09:30] <%correctedsun117> APATHY IS DEATH
[4:09:31] <snakemuho> at least they're not stuck in eternal cycle of death
[4:09:32] <%afronooch> topical
[4:09:33] <+krispen_wa> The other two deserved it because they let themselves get convinced
[4:09:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Vrook had the knee.
[4:09:39] <+SinisterBroccoli> They were WEAK
[4:09:40] <KaitlynnHere> They were apathetic
[4:09:42] <+miyoles> Apathy is death
[4:09:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> Apathy is Death
[4:09:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> Whatever...is after death....
[4:09:46] <GHouseduivel> Apathy is death
[4:09:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> APATHY IS DEATH
[4:09:47] <fuji_92> VROOK GOT WHAT HE FUCKING DESERVES that fucker
[4:09:48] <MarkUriah> I HATE THOSE PEOPLE
[4:09:48] <%DSD24> Reeks of Groupthink
[4:09:48] <%DesertPenguin> Hive Mentality
[4:09:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Vrook clearly controls the council
[4:09:51] <wowowinsane> old boys club all back on their old bullshit once the crew back together
[4:09:55] <Monkeyweed21> You can survive getting cut off from the force, but if you rely on it super hard you die
[4:09:56] <+MidnightBurst12> Kreia wants to kill god
[4:09:57] <TDAWS_MP132> GOD
[4:09:58] <dinnydanny777> Vrook probably had the exact same conversation he had with you with Revan and he learnt fucking nothing so who gives a shit
[4:10:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Group mindset makes people sheep that is why riots happen
[4:10:01] <Space_Pagan> Vrook (Nothing)
[4:10:06] <%DesertPenguin> I'm cool tho pay attention to meeeeee
[4:10:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Say it with me guys.
[4:10:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Apathy
[4:10:08] <subjectg> “All of us are dumber than one of us.”
[4:10:09] <heartlesshealer> Mob mentality is real
[4:10:10] <%roobanguy> Nobody is as stupid as all of us
[4:10:12] <+SinisterBroccoli> is
[4:10:13] <+ggbhtg> high school cliques NEVER END
[4:10:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> George Carlin talked about that, he believed in individuals, not a group
[4:10:17] <fuji_92> death
[4:10:18] <%DSD24> Apathy means death
[4:10:18] <%BisoromiBear> DESS
[4:10:23] <Space_Pagan> DEATH
[4:10:23] <+kralec> don't burn this book?
[4:10:25] <terramagus> Hey guess what, you still get Accessory to Murder
[4:10:29] <jorniev> like cops
[4:10:33] <MarkUriah> God my fucking bullies when I was a kid all acted mad cool when I spoke to them 1 on 1
[4:10:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> APATHY IS DEATH is RELEVANT AS FUCK RIGHT NOW
[4:10:34] <%correctedsun117> Or maybe like cops
[4:10:34] <penitentpentwitch> Sheep must stay with the Flock
[4:10:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> This is why I hate people. A person is smart. People are stupid
[4:10:38] <%DemonOfSalt> Apathy is Death
[4:10:40] <+krispen_wa> God this is Topical AS FUCK
[4:10:43] <+AsinPersuasion> another thing to remember is the dofference between the jedi technique and the sith version is that she makes them experience the death of billions
[4:10:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> This was the BEST TIME to reach this point in the game. It would never be more relevant.
[4:10:48] <Monkeyweed21> Vrook Chauvin

[4:11:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Vrook was about to put the knee, but they weren't going to stop him.
[4:11:11] <DatAsuna> Happy to be watching~
[4:11:14] <+bear_breaker20> maybe this is why bsocial isolation has been easy for everyone
[4:11:15] <heartlesshealer> the most tropical star wars media
[4:11:21] <Djinnazz> not entirely
[4:11:27] <redambr> PLAY NEW VEGAS NEXT
[4:11:29] <%christopherwpoindexter> George Carlin described how amazing people are one on one, and then lose it all when they join a group
[4:11:29] <DatAsuna> I love obsidian but they have made bad games
[4:11:32] <Djinnazz> yes!
[4:11:36] <%DesertPenguin> true
[4:11:36] <%BisoromiBear> truth
[4:11:37] <dinnydanny777> True
[4:11:40] <heartlesshealer> This is true.
[4:11:40] <%Irridium> True
[4:11:41] <+AsinPersuasion> true
[4:11:42] <fuji_92> yeah
[4:11:43] <DatAsuna> Obsidian has made more bad games than good, if I'm honest
[4:11:44] <GHouseduivel> Tru
[4:11:44] <dinnydanny777> Big facts
[4:11:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> SOMETIMES, IT CAN
[4:11:46] <+krispen_wa> Truth
[4:11:46] <Space_Pagan> true
[4:11:46] <%HostilePoundcakes> yeah
[4:11:47] <+MidnightBurst12> facts
[4:11:51] <snakemuho> look at VTMB
[4:11:51] <DatAsuna> But their best 2 are really good
[4:11:51] <frostiifae> the majora's mask effect!
[4:11:51] <MarkUriah> True
[4:11:52] <%DesertPenguin> Necessity is the mother of invention!!
[4:11:52] <KaitlynnHere> Big true true
[4:11:52] <%DemonOfSalt> Light Later
[4:11:58] <WanderingSwordsman> Look at DMC 3
[4:11:59] <+MidnightBurst12> beauty can come from the struggle
[4:12:01] <heartlesshealer> Look at the Sega Genesis sound chip. Then look at Sonic 3 OST
[4:12:04] <+krispen_wa> NWN2: MitB is great too
[4:12:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> NOT ALWAYS, but SOMETIMES IT DOES
[4:12:05] <dinnydanny777> Innovation comes from strife
[4:12:06] <subjectg> restriction begets creativity, as they say
[4:12:06] <jorniev> look at disco elysium
[4:12:07] <%Irridium> but also, how many faults would exist if they had time to fix them
[4:12:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DatAsuna Same with platnum The stinkers are okay but the good ones are grand slams
[4:12:12] <jorniev> yeaaaah
[4:12:18] <+krispen_wa> PLAY MASK OF THE BETRAYER
[4:12:24] <Monkeyweed21> The Avalone Mouthpiece is a tired thing but it CAN BE REAL GOOD
[4:12:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna I'm not even trying to be contrarian, I can't actually think of any Obsidian games that I'd consider total stinkers. What games come to mind?
[4:12:27] <%Irridium> Mask of the Betrayer is so fucking good
[4:12:28] <%christopherwpoindexter> A deadline kills apathy, you have to choose and do things NOW
[4:12:29] <MarkUriah> But at least with star wars, having more time to think on PHILOSPHY is always more interesting
[4:12:29] <+Ancopro> EPIV
[4:12:29] <%DesertPenguin> 70s
[4:12:30] <+miyoles> I say Pillars of eternity is a spiritual successor to KOTOR 2
[4:12:34] <%roobanguy> don't play mask of the betrayer because you have to slog though 40 hours to get there
[4:12:36] <%DesertPenguin> Oh, good old mixing console
[4:12:44] <Space_Pagan> Oh hell yeah, Mask of the Betrayer!
[4:12:44] <%RioGascar> Working with restrictions tho call for HIGHLY SKILLED people to pull it off
[4:12:45] <%roobanguy> just read a lp
[4:12:45] <ogfruitloops> Man, woolie should really play New Vegas
[4:12:51] <+AsinPersuasion> mask is so good
[4:12:51] <%DesertPenguin> I love this shit I went to school for this studio recording
[4:12:53] <+MidnightBurst12> The far off year of 1970
[4:12:57] <+AsinPersuasion> bald waifu is shit tho
[4:12:57] <%DesertPenguin> OVERHEADS
[4:12:59] <+krispen_wa> @roobanguy just skip the vanilla campaign. it sucks anyways
[4:13:07] <jorniev> CASTLEVANIA MUSIC
[4:13:09] <%DesertPenguin> You can use overheads for the drums
[4:13:10] <+krispen_wa> @roobanguy and is irrelevant for most of it
[4:13:11] <%DesertPenguin> save a ton of mics
[4:13:23] <+MidnightBurst12> deal or fail
[4:13:33] <fuji_92> DO OR DIE
[4:13:33] <%DesertPenguin> BEATLES USED 4 MOTHER FUCKERS
[4:13:36] <%DesertPenguin> 4 tracks!!!!
[4:13:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Beatles used 4 Tracks, oh my god I forgot that.
[4:13:46] <+krispen_wa> I keep forgetting V's music is played to thousands every Wednesday
[4:13:48] <+syn_draco> OG Metroid soundtrack
[4:13:51] <dinnydanny777> The Beatles were considered "innovative" for using 4 tracks
[4:13:56] <%DesertPenguin> Cool thanks for that
[4:14:00] <%roobanguy> for some games i think thats fine, but mask is a direct continuation starring your same character so its hard for me to tell people to skip to it
[4:14:09] <%DesertPenguin> I love music tech chat. I could do that for hours V
[4:14:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DesertPenguin Beatles are more known for compisitions not their own talents
[4:14:22] <%roobanguy> its like saying skip ME1 to ME2, you could but you're gonna miss a lot of context
[4:14:26] <%DesertPenguin> I know, it's just a fun fact about studio recording magic
[4:14:33] <%RioGascar> SNES and NES bit music requires mastery in musical composition and understanding to make shit sound amazing for the best composers
[4:14:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> "My soul is telling me to stop you!"
[4:14:43] <%Camail> narrative action
[4:14:45] <%DesertPenguin> 8 bit is basically 8 tracks, right?
[4:14:45] <boostergoldz> devil may cry 3 has one of the best stories in games tho
[4:14:48] <+krispen_wa> @roobanguy there's only two returning characters
[4:14:50] <%kosher_salt_0> the stories are like the shitty shonen aime
[4:14:58] <jorniev> SSS
[4:15:04] <%kosher_salt_0> the story sucks shit, but it still so much fun to watch/read
[4:15:05] <+ggbhtg> Characterization Action Game Kappa @woolieversus
[4:15:09] <ThatGuyThere03> This is why people love New Vegas
[4:15:12] <XeroSigmaPrime> But twhen story is great, you get DMC3
[4:15:13] <GHouseduivel> Increase your persuade skill
[4:15:14] <snakemuho> literally had to restart the game because you chose the wrong option and lost the dialogue boss battle
[4:15:17] <fuji_92> CMD
[4:15:17] <%roobanguy> but one of those characters is directly related to getting the good ending @krispen_wa
[4:15:19] <%Camail> thats what the best crpgs are
[4:15:20] <%BisoromiBear> Kreia Quadruple S'd the whole council
[4:15:22] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏👏
[4:15:24] <MarkUriah> Kreia SSS the council
[4:15:25] <frostiifae> god i would so love a new vegas LP
[4:15:26] <+crimsonharvest> what does an SSS run of Disco Elysium look like
[4:15:29] <%DesertPenguin> Oh man, I'd love to see Woolie try Outer Worlds. He'd have so much fun with that dialogue
[4:15:30] <jorniev> THAT IS LITERALLY DISCO ELYSIUM
[4:15:32] <%christopherwpoindexter> Also different alignment/paths to SSS
[4:15:32] <frostiifae> i want to experience that game but cant get into the setting
[4:15:40] <dinnydanny777> It worked the last time
[4:15:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kreia Smoking SIck Styled the entire fucking Council
[4:15:48] <%Camail> cant cut off a foreskin twice
[4:15:52] <prime_name> Would that cut the party off from the force as well?
[4:15:53] <dinnydanny777> Kreia did it to them and it killed them
[4:15:59] <+AsinPersuasion> they dont do the billion deaths version
[4:16:00] <%therabbles> do the jedi even have that power
[4:16:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> OH, nice catch V
[4:16:16] <subjectg> to use game terms, it would probably just punt out your jedi levels
[4:16:20] <+AsinPersuasion> @dinnydanny777 no kreia did thr malachor echo version
[4:16:28] <+MidnightBurst12> yep
[4:16:34] <+AsinPersuasion> they self suicided cause they couldnt take it
[4:16:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> @camail WOW that's a heck of an analogy
[4:16:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> Revan is POWER a force to be reckend with you....you are nothing.
[4:16:59] <+AsinPersuasion> whatever the jedi do still leaves people alive at the end of the day
[4:17:01] <+MidnightBurst12> kreia didn't cut them off. she ate their force energy
[4:17:04] <+yhento> I thought they would essentially kill you like kreia killed them
[4:17:07] <MarkUriah> Sion is cool but at the end he is a Sith through and Through. Introspection is not his strong suit
[4:17:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> "there were disagreements...ambition" sounds like a rap lyric
[4:17:10] <+SinisterBroccoli> maybe we'll find out
[4:17:16] <DatAsuna> also if you're a woman sion is in love with you
[4:17:23] <%roobanguy> Revan is like looking at the heart of the force, Fan Ny'Pak is like looking at the death of it
[4:17:28] <+jiggy_snipe> he needs to focus on being angry to stay alive
[4:17:34] <DatAsuna> If you play a woman he's a simp lord
[4:17:36] <dinnydanny777> Sion's skin is falling off he doesn't have the time for introspection lol
[4:17:37] <wowowinsane> maaybe
[4:17:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> SECOND PLAYTHROUGH?? 😆
[4:17:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Bad choice Kreia chews us out so hard
[4:17:55] <dinnydanny777> It's crazy to think of Sion as a Jedi tho
[4:18:05] <dinnydanny777> Think about what Sion would be like as a Jedi
[4:18:05] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[4:18:06] <%shincadad> “You have failed me... completely and utterly”
[4:18:14] <Space_Pagan> oof
[4:18:18] <Doodle_Taco> Had to leave for a while...what did they stop on chat?
[4:18:22] <MarkUriah> Sion would probably be dead as a Jedi tho
[4:18:32] <+krispen_wa> I never do dark side not because i don't like being evil, but because I know I let Kreia down
[4:18:34] <%roobanguy> @Doodle_Taco they talked with the jedi masters
[4:18:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> The end of the Enclave reunion
[4:18:42] <ULTRA__64> NANI!!? doodAnime
[4:18:45] <+MidnightBurst12> NANI!?!?!
[4:18:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @roobanguy Revan is looking at a star in the sky. Exile is like looking into the inky blackness that surrounds it
[4:18:52] <+ggbhtg> masaka masako
[4:19:05] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:19:09] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[4:19:14] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[4:19:14] <prime_name> THAT'S ME
[4:19:16] <Doodle_Taco> @roobanguy thanks!
[4:19:17] <+MidnightBurst12> LUL
[4:19:18] <%Irridium> THAT WAS ME TOO
[4:19:19] <+jiggy_snipe> well its not gospel
[4:19:21] <Xanax44> literally me
[4:19:24] <prince_johnny_> Right
[4:19:26] <Xanax44> like 7 years old
[4:19:26] <Halospaz117> same
[4:19:28] <+syn_draco> Saaame
[4:19:32] <MarkUriah> Same
[4:19:35] <DatAsuna> And that's why kotor 1 is still overall more popular
[4:19:37] <%arran_throttle> SAME! TRUE!! FUCKING TRUE!
[4:19:37] <+miyoles> same
[4:19:39] <+rebelinhell> So are we gonna tell Woolie about Kreia's response to the dark side exile after their interaction with the council? Or should we let V handle that?
[4:19:40] <+crimsonharvest> not having the context was terrible, i hated it at launch
[4:19:43] <+MidnightBurst12> Kotor 2 has too many layers
[4:19:53] <%RioGascar> I WAS SO CONFUSED AS A KID FROM THIS GAME
[4:19:58] <%christopherwpoindexter> I still feel like "dont wanna fight." I haven't even played 1 yet, only 2!!
[4:20:01] <dinnydanny777> I want to know what Sion was like as a Jedi
[4:20:02] <ogfruitloops> dark sides great you can make onderan build you a temple and send you all their force sensitive kids
[4:20:05] <Xanax44> this game taught me the world is cruel lol
[4:20:10] <308caliber> Kotor 2 is too good man
[4:20:12] <TairinSoulgem> She did do it by the jedi
[4:20:15] <+MidnightBurst12> Kid me was not ready for this game
[4:20:16] <dinnydanny777> My hot take is that Sion as a Jedi must have been pretty damn interesting
[4:20:16] <+krispen_wa> FUCK IT, I'M PLAYING KOTOR II AGAIN
[4:20:21] <Xanax44> bioware is the greatest
[4:20:22] <+miyoles> KOTOR is the main reason I love RPGs as a kid
[4:20:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Xanax44 Kreia would be proud
[4:20:24] <+krispen_wa> IT'S SO GOOD
[4:20:24] <+captain_history> I remember loving it as a teen and people saying me it was bad
[4:20:28] <+SolidusRex> But I am the "guys, stop fighting!" guy right now :(
[4:20:37] <+ggbhtg> Survivor Series ya
[4:20:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> @krispen_wa it's all I've been playing for the entirety of quarantine
[4:20:48] <Huntercd> Why is it so dark?
[4:20:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AsinPersuasion
[4:21:03] <+ggbhtg> Its almost midnight LUL
[4:21:05] <+AsinPersuasion> can we revisit the onderon choice
[4:21:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie's HOLD ON tech came back to bite him.
[4:21:12] <dinnydanny777> Is Sion even evil or did he just turn to save his own life?
[4:21:15] <MarkUriah> But that could've been worked out though. Just tell people to leave Granny in her shame room
[4:21:15] <jorniev> witcher is about that shit too
[4:21:16] <+krispen_wa> @christopherwpoindexter I played through the whole thing in like a few weeks when these guys started KOTOR II.
[4:21:20] <+jiggy_snipe> idk neither side really explained why they were right and expected you to take side
[4:21:26] <%DesertPenguin> hahahahaha
[4:21:28] <+AsinPersuasion> i still think that was some apathy is death shit
[4:21:30] <Huntercd> Has Woolie joined the dark side? Darth Woolie?
[4:21:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 What happens if you replace Sion with NIhilus in that sentence?
[4:21:35] <+AsinPersuasion> choosing not to intervene
[4:21:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> Doesn't she basically say "Thank you for making a choice." if you pick one the other two
[4:21:40] <%DesertPenguin> Sounds like my first time LUL
[4:21:41] <%BisoromiBear> dang weed head
[4:21:42] <%HostilePoundcakes> GASP
[4:21:43] <Halospaz117> WHA
[4:21:43] <+crimsonharvest> I had to invent a mantra to keep my sanity, "i know who I am and I know how I got here"
[4:21:44] <+krispen_wa> @christopherwpoindexter It says something about how good it is that I want to play it again only a few mo tbs later
[4:21:46] <%arran_throttle> WutFace BibleThump
[4:21:46] <%DesertPenguin> Bong hits when you're a newb is not good
[4:21:47] <BurdRightsActivist> WEED WEED WEED

[4:22:14] <snakemuho> WEED SENSITIVE
[4:22:16] <lotharrio> You began to manually breath.
[4:22:17] <XeroSigmaPrime> Weed sex is best sex
[4:22:23] <%DesertPenguin> Weed sex is worst sex
[4:22:25] <%Camail> just gas
[4:22:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Feel your blood flowing.
[4:22:33] <+krispen_wa> BIG WEEDS
[4:22:34] <dinnydanny777> Yeah it could apply to Nihilus too, is he actually even a Sith or is he just trying not to die?
[4:22:35] <Daxalog> Little V Mills has made the first steps to becoming a Jedi Gaurdian.
[4:22:36] <XeroSigmaPrime> @DesertPenguin You wanna fucking fight?
[4:22:37] <%DesertPenguin> Yea dude that was dumb
[4:22:37] <ZweihanderSteve> that was my first experience pot brownies
[4:22:38] <$Invlux> Y'all gotta take weed to feel indigestion?
[4:22:39] <+ggbhtg> Hol Weed
[4:22:40] <%DSD24> Yeah what the hell is weed sex that sounds terrible
[4:22:42] <%Malik1002> litte V felt the echo of his body I see
[4:22:43] <%afronooch> yeah, no
[4:22:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> You are now manually breathing
[4:22:46] <%correctedsun117> A bong rip was my first experience ever
[4:22:46] <+crimsonharvest> hello im dabbin btw thanks for being friendly
[4:22:47] <%DesertPenguin> Fight? What?
[4:22:48] <Xanax44> DEFINITELY dont do dabs
[4:22:49] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[4:22:50] <XeroSigmaPrime> @DesertPenguin I will fuck you until you love Weed sex
[4:22:51] <MarkUriah> Huh?
[4:22:51] <+MidnightBurst12> Visions mean it's just an view into yous brain's inside
[4:22:53] <%BisoromiBear> eat the stars cocksuckas
[4:22:53] <Warfey> Don't eat the brownies, holy shit!
[4:22:55] <Halospaz117> I will eat a platter of brownies out of spite now
[4:22:55] <+xddddsorandom> DO -NOT- EAT THE BROWNIES
[4:22:57] <GHouseduivel> Edible just the one
[4:22:58] <Daxalog> Brownies aint shit. BUUUHHHHHHHHH
[4:22:59] <+xddddsorandom> NEVER EVER
[4:22:59] <%DesertPenguin> Please do, I haven't had any in awhile LUL
[4:23:02] <+MidnightBurst12> don't tell me what to do
[4:23:04] <%Irridium> DON'T EAT MULTIPLE BROWNIES WHATEVER YOU DO
[4:23:07] <Texascourier> i started with a cookie by accident
[4:23:09] <%Irridium> you WILL have a bad time
[4:23:10] <+ggbhtg> What about edibles? @woolieversus
[4:23:11] <Xchunkylover73x> Brownies fuck me for a WEEK
[4:23:11] <%DesertPenguin> *pulls down pants*
[4:23:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> Entropy is life
[4:23:12] <%Lion_kun> Uptime!
[4:23:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, I ate two brownies after having four beers and 4 shots, I literally become cataonic on the couch for 8 hours.
[4:23:15] <%roobanguy> eh
[4:23:20] <%DesertPenguin> Take me, lover.
[4:23:20] <+MidnightBurst12> i'll eat all the brownies
[4:23:26] <%roobanguy> i liked the pillar of eternity games
[4:23:27] <lotharrio> Jade Empire, though.
[4:23:34] <sologarza> Just eat the lettuce Kappa
[4:23:34] <%roobanguy> no
[4:23:36] <DatAsuna> they made dungeon siege lol
[4:23:36] <+AsinPersuasion> pillars is great
[4:23:38] <+crimsonharvest> Constraints is why Chris Roberts' only good game is Privateer.
[4:23:41] <%DesertPenguin> I loved Jade Empire, that was before I knew about "the industry"
[4:23:41] <DatAsuna> jade empire was bioware
[4:23:43] <+AsinPersuasion> fuck the haters
[4:23:45] <+jiggy_snipe> pressure can create greatness and time can lead to garbage
[4:23:48] <fuji_92> LUL fucking bioware magic
[4:23:49] <+bear_breaker20> or kill yourself via bong rips its your body
[4:23:50] <%DSD24> The "implication"
[4:23:52] <+syn_draco> They had direction though
[4:23:52] <ULTRA__64> "Bioware Magic"
[4:23:53] <lotharrio> Yo @WoolieVersus Jade Empire was great.
[4:23:59] <%Irridium> I just wanted the companions to be fleshed out more, honestly
[4:24:00] <%therabbles> Pillars of Eternity needs commitment to get through
[4:24:00] <%DesertPenguin> Play Jade Empire!!!!
[4:24:02] <+miyoles> I loved Jade empire
[4:24:05] <+krispen_wa> Jade Empire is fine
[4:24:06] <ZweihanderSteve> it was half of one made specifically by a friend cuz i cant stand smoking. it was mild at best mostly because it hit while i was asleep :)
[4:24:06] <derap41> Crunch is good it makes good games look at Red Dead 2
[4:24:07] <DatAsuna> I love jade empire but that wasn't obsidian
[4:24:09] <+ggbhtg> Oops ALL CRUNCH BERRIES
[4:24:18] <+AsinPersuasion> the white march might be one of the greatest expansions ever
[4:24:19] <%DesertPenguin> That's totally fine
[4:24:24] <+krispen_wa> Fair
[4:24:25] <dinnydanny777> There's probably more bad games made with crunch than good games made with crunch
[4:24:26] <+MidnightBurst12> star wars is also just a grsat setting for these kind of stories
[4:24:27] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[4:24:27] <%DesertPenguin> If you do it to yourself you're only doing it to yourself so....
[4:24:31] <+MidnightBurst12> yep
[4:24:32] <tidalwafer> woolie should play tyranny, if he can get past the camera angle he'd adore it
[4:24:36] <Warfey> y e p
[4:24:36] <+syn_draco> All the time & resources in the world don't mean shit if you don't have a goal in sight. Look at Anthem & ME:Andromeda for evidence of that
[4:24:36] <%DesertPenguin> Who dat? lol
[4:24:38] <Huntercd> Cuts the roof of your mouth
[4:24:39] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but Sakurai is crunching himself isn't he?
[4:24:40] <%alrobot2014> that man takes it to an extreme
[4:24:41] <%RioGascar> now what does valve fall into? they are ones that have money and talent but also...work on things forever???
[4:24:41] <+crimsonharvest> if you're doing it because your email contains the phrase 'quarterly deliverables' then get fucked
[4:24:45] <+MidnightBurst12> not healthy' but managagbe
[4:24:45] <derap41> Crunch Works for 3 days then its not worth it
[4:24:48] <+jiggy_snipe> is he crunching or just refusing to stop?
[4:24:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I don't think I'll ever get a break."
[4:24:49] <%therabbles> Masahiro "Plugged in" Sakurai
[4:24:51] <+bear_breaker20> simply time + new blood
[4:24:53] <Daxalog> Sakurai is on an IV in the office
[4:24:56] <%DesertPenguin> But you gotta get that album out
[4:24:56] <jorniev> extra effort is not the same as working to the GRAVE
[4:24:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus While I don't think crunch is a good thing not having a deadline leads to all kinds of issues. My not having a crunch or end goal leads to no art being produced during quarenteen
[4:25:00] <fuji_92> poor Sakurai
[4:25:02] <derap41> After 3 days you are less effective than if you didn't crunch
[4:25:03] <%DesertPenguin> Did you do that V?
[4:25:05] <+krispen_wa> but what about japan where people impose crunch on themselves to look good?
[4:25:05] <Warfey> limesS
[4:25:23] <+ggbhtg> Crunch Based Netcode
[4:25:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1268068275423981569?s=20
[4:25:24] <+MidnightBurst12> Masahiro "IV DRIP" Sakurai
[4:25:26] <%alrobot2014> do not roll d20s on continuing your crunch
[4:25:29] <%DesertPenguin> That's a bad
[4:25:30] <DatAsuna> been there
[4:25:30] <derap41> Don't Sit on the toilet programmign
[4:25:32] <%DesertPenguin> One bad, sir.
[4:25:33] <MasterDecoder> MONTY OUM
[4:25:34] <%Camail> i hate JP napping culture
[4:25:35] <+crimsonharvest> Real talk bipolar people like myself frequently work on a 'natural' crunch cycle its bullshit lol
[4:25:35] <DatAsuna> uni was hell
[4:25:50] <+MidnightBurst12> University fucking sucks
[4:26:02] <frostiifae> "natural crunch" sounds like a huge ass adhd mood
[4:26:05] <DatAsuna> Kotor 2 is a well loved niche fanbase
[4:26:12] <%Camail> the revan reveal is more memorable as a singular moment than anything
[4:26:16] <DatAsuna> but kotor 1 is the mass market popularity
[4:26:16] <dinnydanny777> Idk, I can get that, if he feels KOTOR1 had more time put into it
[4:26:19] <frostiifae> "i literally cannot focus on something until my anxiety surrounding it makes it all i can think about"
[4:26:22] <+krispen_wa> KOTOR II's endgame kinda sucks even with restored content
[4:26:25] <DatAsuna> and also revan is much easier to get behind
[4:26:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> Revan is a power fantasy. Exile is a character study
[4:26:29] <+syn_draco> The Revan twist was probably the first videogame twist that a lot of people experienced, too
[4:26:34] <DatAsuna> It also helps that revan has a mask
[4:26:39] <BurdRightsActivist> From my perspective, the Jedi are evil
[4:26:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @krispen_wa Let's not potentially color Woolie's impression before he gets there.
[4:26:40] <+MidnightBurst12> Kotor 1 fits with the star wars brand better
[4:26:40] <dinnydanny777> If you feel like you put more time into something you'll be less surprised when people enjoy it
[4:26:44] <%CyanDeadEye> This is why people like Kyle Katarn too
[4:26:48] <+krispen_wa> I love that the Exile actually HAS a character compared to Revan
[4:26:49] <DatAsuna> you can make fanart of that mask, but the exile has nothing to spread just visually
[4:26:52] <%RioGascar> Kotor 1 i love cause it NAILS S T A R W A R S
[4:27:00] <+MidnightBurst12> Kotor 2 is just a good story
[4:27:02] <%RioGascar> but kotor 2...EVOLVES STAR WARS
[4:27:05] <+krispen_wa> compared to KOTOR I Revan*
[4:27:13] <%Gruhunchously> The final act of KOTOR 2 is probably the weakest
[4:27:15] <+MidnightBurst12> Kotor 2 is star wars 2.0
[4:27:17] <%RioGascar> like kotor 1 is a star wars movie
[4:27:31] <wowowinsane> that last scene is as powerful as it was because of the context kotor 1 provides
[4:27:32] <dinnydanny777> KOTOR 1 is better than Episode 7
[4:27:35] <KaitlynnHere> KOTOR 1 is a good Star Wars movie
[4:27:49] <GHouseduivel> I was the cat, all along
[4:27:49] <JanusII> "You are your father."
[4:27:53] <+krispen_wa> yup
[4:27:53] <Halospaz117> YES
[4:28:01] <BurdRightsActivist> DON'T SAY TLJ
[4:28:02] <DatAsuna> TLJ also tries to steal from the ulic comics too
[4:28:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> @RioGascar Kotor 2 breaks starwars on its knee then shows you every part. Points out its flaws. Then shows why those flaws exist. Then puts it back together again.
[4:28:02] <derap41> It does Thrice as much with an eight the budget
[4:28:06] <Warfey> I can see that
[4:28:06] <+MidnightBurst12> Peak star wars vs star wars actually becoming more
[4:28:07] <%kyh9> I mean, TLJ obviously copied a lot of ideas from KOTOR2
[4:28:08] <DatAsuna> well, play homage
[4:28:08] <prince_johnny_> Yup
[4:28:09] <BurdRightsActivist> DON'T COMPARE KOTOR2 TO TLJ
[4:28:13] <KaitlynnHere> Gawd last Jedi was such a mess
[4:28:17] <Xanax44> that is why my soul burns
[4:28:18] <BurdRightsActivist> monkaS
[4:28:25] <ThatGuyThere03> IT BEGINS
[4:28:27] <derap41> What Characters are in TLJ?
[4:28:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> god, the millions of people who saw TLJ, if they just saw KOTOR 2 as a movie.......
[4:28:29] <Halospaz117> That's a large part of why I don't like Last Jedi, cuz everything good about it was done light-years better in KOTOR 2
[4:28:30] <DatAsuna> THat was me
[4:28:32] <%Gruhunchously> BUT...KOTOR 2 deserved an Extended Cut far more than Mass Effect 3 ever did. KOTOR 2's ending has problems becasue they didn't have enough time. ME3's ending has problems becasue they had no idea what they were doing from the outset.
[4:28:37] <+ggbhtg> Ah yes, the Joss Whedon style @woolieversus
[4:28:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Witcher 3 has a good story, but it's CHARACTERS are A+++.
[4:28:42] <KaitlynnHere> No wait, the skywalker returns movie was way worse
[4:28:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Virgin Last Jedi vs Knights of the Chad Republic 2
[4:28:48] <DatAsuna> ME3 existed in the world of patches, kotor 2 didn't
[4:28:53] <privatesargent> i can see the comparison, KOTOR2 is MUCH better then the Last Jedi, but there are similarities in methodology
[4:28:54] <+ArthurDayne88> 3 of the great party members were from the first game though
[4:28:55] <KaitlynnHere> Or whatever the fuck it was
[4:29:00] <MarkUriah> Star Wars is strong world. Which is why most of the side stuff is higher quality
[4:29:00] <GHouseduivel> @BurdRightsActivist Chads of the old republic
[4:29:00] <+MidnightBurst12> Kotor 2 was an amazing thing that will probably never happen again and it kills me
[4:29:05] <KaitlynnHere> Ok
[4:29:08] <snakemuho> having KOTOR2 as one of my favorite games kinda made me not hate TLJ for at least trying something weird
[4:29:09] <%Irridium> That's why I do like Last Jedi, warts and all. At least it tried.
[4:29:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is APATHY IS DEATH the hard counter to HOLD ON?
[4:29:16] <%DSD24> Visas and Handmaiden are both great
[4:29:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @kyh9 GEE Rian Johnson who stole the plot from battlestar galacticga and the ending from escape from new york stole from kotor2? whats next water is wet?
[4:29:30] <%DSD24> @CommanderSqueaks The hardest of counters
[4:29:37] <MarkUriah> @CommanderSqueaks Absolutely
[4:29:44] <Warfey> limesLUL
[4:29:49] <+krispen_wa> RIGHT
[4:29:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> The HOOD COMING OFF was the biggest shit.
[4:29:52] <308caliber> YUP
[4:30:05] <KaitlynnHere> And pushes them over first
[4:30:08] <+Aheg0d> Darth Talon is my favourite Sith Kreygasm
[4:30:09] <dinnydanny777> Those Jedi are Sith
[4:30:15] <YakumoYomi> Can we get an APATHY IS DEAD emote to contrast with Pat's HOLD ON emote?
[4:30:15] <GHouseduivel> Let me tell you why we need to kill you
[4:30:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> @midnightburst12 partly why one of my big goal/high priority careers is a writer/game designer, slowly but surely, this shit is serious artistic inspiration
[4:30:22] <%Gruhunchously> The way the Jedi act isn't even out of character form the way they acted in the prequels
[4:30:26] <%kyh9> @doc_ock_rokc I wouldn't even mind him stealing it if he executed well. TLJ has some of its own ideas but he doesn't stick the landing and committing
[4:30:27] <KaitlynnHere> And then when Vrook stood up she was like “bitch”
[4:30:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am convinced Vrook had fallen to the dark side the moment he decided to cut you off from the Force.
[4:30:30] <%DSD24> The Arrogance
[4:30:35] <Halospaz117> SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN
[4:30:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> SHE LAUNCHES VROOK TWICE
[4:30:48] <%darthvaderwasasimp> Loving this series so far question for V if AEW ever wanted you to perform Kenny omegas entrance at a pay per view would you be down
[4:30:53] <KaitlynnHere> Vrook deserves it
[4:30:55] <+Freeborg1997> Kreia gets angry with you, if YOU kill them.
[4:30:58] <+MidnightBurst12> They're an example of everything that's wrong with the jedi
[4:30:58] <%christopherwpoindexter> Kreia saves the pure Lawful Good exile playthroughs
[4:31:14] <%christopherwpoindexter> by saying what you dont wanna say
[4:31:15] <+MidnightBurst12> it's perfect
[4:31:15] <%Camail> stay away. STAY.
[4:31:19] <%Camail> down, bitch
[4:31:22] <%DSD24> The audacity of this bitch
[4:31:24] <+MidnightBurst12> ARROGANCE
[4:31:28] <BurdRightsActivist> NOT EVEN CANON
[4:31:30] <Halospaz117> God Kreia's VA is fucking perfect
[4:31:31] <KaitlynnHere> Sit. The. Fuck. Down
[4:31:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> @kyh9 Unfortunately it stole almost everything people think it did on its own. the only unique thought was the Hyperspace kamikaze and that BREAKS starwars tactics
[4:31:33] <+krispen_wa> See it through the eyes of the exile
[4:31:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> FORCE YEET
[4:31:35] <DatAsuna> Also shout out to her voice actress,not a game VO person, just a theatre granny
[4:31:36] <terramagus> Now go watch the Dark Side version of the Conclave
[4:31:45] <fuji_92> MAN KREIA IS SO FUCKIN GOOD
[4:31:48] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus At some point you should look up the dark side version of that scene, 'cause it is BRUTAL.
[4:31:50] <lotharrio> It almost feels like she was on the fence about what she was gonna do.
[4:31:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna Oh shit, I didn't know that.
[4:31:54] <redambr> and each one of them is different side of the negative aspects of the jedi: stupid, arrogant, passive
[4:32:02] <+ggbhtg> @datasuna JUST?
[4:32:06] <+syn_draco> @DatAsuna Isn't she the same VA for Flemeth in the Dragon Age series?
[4:32:14] <heartlesshealer> okay, V will guide at the end
[4:32:16] <ingman112> Nah different VO
[4:32:19] <+krispen_wa> not flemeth
[4:32:19] <heartlesshealer> worries gone
[4:32:24] <+syn_draco> dang
[4:32:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:32:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> V will guide your hips
[4:32:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> apparently kreia's actress is classically trained in Shakespearean theatre? Hence her having that kind of 'villain-ish' presence
[4:32:33] <DatAsuna> I got you on the highlight reel
[4:32:49] <DatAsuna> @Wyrm_Swarm nah flemeth was someone else
[4:32:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> @christopherwpoindexter It does give her a far more dramatic air
[4:32:49] <KaitlynnHere> Nawh Detroit beyond Old Republic
[4:33:00] <%christopherwpoindexter> YES @doc_ock_rokc
[4:33:10] <%Starlight_Gamer> !uptime
[4:33:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kreaa is also a character archetype that Chris uses in Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment. They're essentially Chris's MouthPiece character. They tell you what Chris is thinking.
[4:33:10] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 43 minutes
[4:33:16] <KaitlynnHere> It fucking hurt
[4:33:18] <%DSD24> Thanks for streaming Woolie!
[4:33:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> But a good place to stop
[4:33:23] <KaitlynnHere> I did that, it was rough
[4:33:26] <+MidnightBurst12> LUL
[4:33:29] <terramagus> I hope you watch a video of what the ending is like without the Restored Content, because it's unreal
[4:33:29] <+krispen_wa> Kreia is less shitty Ulysses
[4:33:32] <frostiifae> o7
[4:33:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> @kaitlynnhere 😢
[4:33:34] <MarkUriah> good night
[4:33:34] <Djinnazz> GAME OVER
[4:33:35] <+ggbhtg> W O R T H
[4:33:35] <GHouseduivel> Peace
