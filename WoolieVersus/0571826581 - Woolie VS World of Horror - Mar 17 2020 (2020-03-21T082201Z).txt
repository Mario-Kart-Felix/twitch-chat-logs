[0:21:40] <+konekoryugamine> What blue gem? There's no blue gem in this game
[0:21:43] <+mczarklesby> There’s a great old test from the 50s where they show you surreal images with ambiguous context. Can’t remember the name, checking.

[0:29:17] <ssmotzer> 2 bit adds more colors
[0:29:18] <+konekoryugamine> It's minor but the details do help out
[0:29:21] <TDAWS_MP132> it changes the pallets way more
[0:29:22] <+Ryu_R> its not minor fuck you look around
[0:29:24] <+LunarDensetsu> Yeeeeaaaaaaaah

[0:45:30] <BakaAkaKeri> I like the sensation of the bat being equiped
[0:45:32] <+konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus As a contrast, I played through the tutorial investigation, and I looked at the cases. It came up as a failure, and I lost 1 reason due to one trophy being for a Cannibal Eating Contest from 1956.

[0:53:28] <boomstickery> its easy jsut go slow and read the buttons
[0:53:34] <simulationbard> You have no weapon
[0:53:34] <$Noponiz> sounds like transistor in BASE concept

[0:53:36] <lotharrio> Dial-a-DO-COMBO
[0:53:40] <hntronium> This is kinda like original xcom
[0:53:45] <boomstickery> also you should ahve equipped the bat

[0:56:08] <Hammatime8> "I have no bat and I must kick"
[0:56:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> ye
[0:56:19] <wydamn> @Hammatime8 LUL
[0:56:20] <+konekoryugamine> The hell does Boogie SourPls mean? I've seen that crap all over Twitch and I have next to no idea what that means.
[0:56:23] <NemokillerV> Kick the shit outta this jar
[0:56:24] <+DiabloDeAzul> you don't have enough time
[0:56:26] <DianaTheAscian> cant go over
[0:56:28] <tattleworm> kick takes 55 so there's no more room
[0:56:32] <+jiggy_snipe> hyakuretsukyaku

[0:56:36] <hntronium> Do your maths properly
[0:56:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kick requires 55 time, you cannot have more than 200 total
[0:56:38] <+projectmanatees> @konekoryugamine its an emote
[0:56:38] <OkamiDude15> punch that glass
[0:56:42] <+konekoryugamine> K
[0:56:49] <laguerrilha> "stop hitting your self"
[0:56:51] <+konekoryugamine> Oh hey, Peach is streaming Dark OSuls rn
[0:56:53] <+konekoryugamine> BRB
[0:57:05] <Nekros4442> Does Woolie know that the stats on the left are a bit cut off?
[0:57:08] <wydamn> @konekoryugamine probably related to some browser plugin that adds extra emotes. Feel free to ignore it if you're not a tryhard.
[0:57:10] <KatabolicRage> you gotta click it
[0:57:10] <%Run44forrest> @konekoryugamine bttv emote you can download an extension to see it just search up bttv
[0:57:17] <Dr_Mooose> is the left slightly off screen, or that the game size also?
[0:57:22] <+konekoryugamine> AND nevermind I am back. Got greeted to Pat's beastial yawn.
[0:57:23] <hntronium> gun
[0:57:30] <+EldritchBee> @Dr_Mooose thats the game, it just looks like that
[0:57:34] <+konekoryugamine> Yep
[0:57:40] <+konekoryugamine> Soon the combat becomes second nature.
[0:57:51] <+konekoryugamine> But there are tricks to the combat.
[0:58:07] <+konekoryugamine> Knowledge based.
[0:58:07] <wydamn> DO A DOUBLE JUMP HERE
[0:58:09] <Dhurkst> Just joined. How's woolz been doing at the game?
[0:58:16] <+konekoryugamine> Tit for tat.
[0:58:18] <+Ryu_R> bad
[0:58:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Still in tutorial
[0:58:22] <+konekoryugamine> That's the focus of some actions.
[0:58:22] <+Ryu_R> bat*
[0:58:23] <Nekros4442> @EldritchBee I dont know about that. Everything ive seen of the game doesnt have the text cut off like that
[0:58:37] <OkamiDude15> punch mom is at the helm for this session. woolie is the spectator
[0:58:38] <ManfredA> It's No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle
[0:58:39] <presque> He's not been doing, punchmom has
[0:58:40] <+konekoryugamine> That's because of the border right now and the fact the formatting of the game is a fical bitch.
[0:58:48] <+kapcommunist> Punchmom is on the sticks, its an intersiting twist
[0:58:49] <+Mendin> The combat is assuming you didn't find the bat and giving you that bonus option
[0:58:50] <OozieStream> SMASH THAT JAR
[0:58:55] <Thirtine> !CONCUSSED!
[0:58:56] <+konekoryugamine> AND now you're concussed.
[0:58:56] <BoneofMalkav> Concussion LUL
[0:58:59] <+EldritchBee> @Nekros4442 they may have a little bit more cut off than normal but its supposed to be somewhat cut off
[0:59:03] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah that's not good either.
[0:59:03] <wydamn> CONCUSSION has been added to your injury list
[0:59:04] <+jiggy_snipe> damn you're NFL now

[0:59:22] <tattleworm> real life has a way higher doom counter rn
[0:59:24] <ManfredA> btw make sure to check what injuries actually do cuz not all are equal
[0:59:29] <+DiabloDeAzul> doom comes later
[0:59:34] <BoneofMalkav> ^

[1:00:08] <ManfredA> @FrostedZaibatsu doom is a delayed instant kill, death is the instant instant
[1:00:10] <+konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus Backpack emote. Bottom left.

[1:00:20] <OkamiDude15> doom gives you 60 seconds before the party member dies
[1:00:26] <OkamiDude15> iirc
[1:00:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @hntronium it'll get better
[1:00:32] <+konekoryugamine> I am actively make the REEEEE face right now.
[1:00:34] <%FrostedZaibatsu> @ManfredA okay thanks

[1:00:49] <KatabolicRage> honestly this games tutorial could be better
[1:00:50] <ZeeJiggle> Fight this eldritch mofo with a STICK
[1:00:58] <cochramd1992> @Hammatime8 NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:01:00] <+konekoryugamine> It's the best it can do and remember, it's still in the beta stages.
[1:01:02] <+Mendin> This game is solidly in beta
[1:01:03] <hntronium> Math is hard
[1:01:06] <rubbishbinge> cant see enemy hp ;-;
[1:01:07] <+Ryu_R> just read the squares?
[1:01:11] <ManfredA> it's meant to be discovered on your own
[1:01:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> 8 HP?
[1:01:16] <+konekoryugamine> Don't judge a final product when it's in Beta.
[1:01:17] <lotharrio> Prepare then heavy attack I guess.
[1:01:18] <alephalpha> the mth is eays play aiko and slaughter everything
[1:01:18] <ManfredA> it's not a handholdy game
[1:01:22] <KatabolicRage> when in doubt, prep -> strong attack
[1:01:23] <Hammatime8> Or was the knife in the other room? My memory is REALLY bad today?
[1:01:25] <BakerBrute> nice
[1:01:25] <+Mendin> nice
[1:01:26] <MrLily> 69 ayyy
[1:01:28] <Dr_Mooose> nice
[1:01:31] <Thirtine> nice
[1:01:34] <+konekoryugamine> The knife is in the other room most of the time.
[1:01:35] <Crombells> try to use up all the time with the prep abilities
[1:01:39] <+Ryu_R> its not like a skill based game, just read a little
[1:01:56] <DrGhostJelly> double concussion

[1:02:02] <+jiggy_snipe> oh no CTE
[1:02:04] <blackkanye> Finally brain damage
[1:02:04] <wydamn> In the this part, you need to AIRDASH into the DIAGONAL WALL and then press down to QUICK DROP.
[1:02:04] <Dr_Mooose> yeesh
[1:02:06] <%Run44forrest> strong attacks arent worth it until you get higher damage weapons
[1:02:07] <+konekoryugamine> Vunderbaar.
[1:02:08] <ZeeJiggle> Stacking up all the concussions
[1:02:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Double concussion PogChamp
[1:02:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hurray, aneurysms~!
[1:02:15] <ZeeJiggle> People are JEALOUS of how many concussions we got
[1:02:17] <cochramd1992> REASON AT RISK

[1:02:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[1:02:32] <Thirtine> whiff
[1:02:34] <Crombells> you should really try to use up all your time with the preps
[1:02:35] <Alias_McDoe> you can guarantee your attacks
[1:02:40] <ManfredA> !!reason at risk!!
[1:02:43] <alephalpha> prep str.atk
[1:02:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:02:46] <+Mendin> The improvised weapon had a "Quick To Equip" tag on it
[1:02:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> You have a PREP action
[1:02:49] <%Infernal_Dalek> He looks pretty chill all things considered
[1:02:49] <lotharrio> @alephalpha She has two different health bars. One is Stamina (16) and the other is Reason (10)
[1:02:49] <Doodle_Taco> @woolieversus Try using the attack boosters
[1:02:52] <Alias_McDoe> prepare attack guarantees the attack
[1:02:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:02:54] <+konekoryugamine> NOPE>
[1:02:55] <%Run44forrest> concussion go up
[1:02:56] <+konekoryugamine> NOT NOW.
[1:02:58] <+konekoryugamine> NOT NOW
[1:02:59] <arkv01> time for THOTS AND PRAYERS
[1:02:59] <wydamn> @WoolieVersus it helps if you PREPARE your attacks.
[1:03:00] <cochramd1992> nooooooooo
[1:03:00] <glaciusinfinite> Use a prepare action
[1:03:00] <+konekoryugamine> NOT NOW.
[1:03:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> NOT NOW
[1:03:04] <DrGhostJelly> oh boy
[1:03:04] <RyanTheRecluse> @woolieversus Injuries have specific effects, to see what they are you can click on the injury in the injury tab.
[1:03:05] <Thirtine> NOPE
[1:03:05] <alephalpha> I mena how much doe sthe enemy has it's cut off
[1:03:07] <undeadarchitect> Is this YuYu Hakusho the game?
[1:03:08] <laguerrilha> the attack on the left can guarantee an attack
[1:03:11] <alephalpha> I've played this a bunch befor
[1:03:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Spiritual is for fighting ghosts
[1:03:13] <glaciusinfinite> No dont
[1:03:14] <+DiabloDeAzul> ghosts only
[1:03:14] <ManfredA> those are for ghosts
[1:03:20] <+TheRisingPride> Pray for mercy, you won't recieve it
[1:03:27] <+konekoryugamine> DON'T.
[1:03:29] <adamisfruit> Ghosts only
[1:03:31] <ManfredA> RUN AWAY IS SUPER STRONG THO
[1:03:32] <Dr_Mooose> become coward
[1:03:34] <ManfredA> not right now though
[1:03:37] <+konekoryugamine> You can't run from a tutorial fight.
[1:03:39] <adamisfruit> Ghosts only, this is t ghost
[1:03:48] <ZeeJiggle> Das a good button
[1:03:51] <alephalpha> run is strong unless you aiko or against ithachac
[1:03:51] <ManfredA> some enemies just aren't worth fighting
[1:03:53] <wydamn> Run away is the Jojo strategy
[1:03:56] <+konekoryugamine> No, ghosts in the game right now have a more fierce attack strength. Update.
[1:03:56] <Crombells> you are actively reducing your chance to hit by now using the preps to maximize the time spent
[1:03:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Running is a legitimate strategy
[1:03:59] <+schlager087> so what boss is this?
[1:04:02] <+DiabloDeAzul> Dodge scales with Dex, so it can be OP
[1:04:07] <+konekoryugamine> Mods will be ready to be implemented for the game in April.
[1:04:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @schlager087 Tutorial enemy
[1:04:14] <lotharrio> Two or three light attacks might be better than a light and heavy.
[1:04:22] <Dhurkst> @Ernasty1 Yuyu Hakusho if the author were influenced by night terrors, drugs, and severe mental health issues. Not really, it's a cross between Lovecraft & Junji Ito.

[1:09:12] <ManfredA> she's still nightmare fuel if you don't do the ritual
[1:09:13] <laguerrilha> Beauty is relative....
[1:09:15] <+Mendin> This game is Japanese Arkham Horror ft Junji Ito
[1:09:22] <BoneofMalkav> ^
[1:09:22] <Galacta_Pieta> Do not fuck a human centipede
[1:09:25] <glaciusinfinite> Use prepare
[1:09:26] <+konekoryugamine> Hey Woolie! You gave me an idea! Watch your Twitter feed!!
[1:09:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Next action
[1:09:32] <glaciusinfinite> yes
[1:09:36] <hattrick61> no DONT fuck a human centepexe
[1:09:38] <nerdblase> At least a whole tube of lipstick goes into that face.
[1:09:41] <xxterminatorviixx> So she’s a death scissor
[1:09:44] <+konekoryugamine> And got the screenshot.
[1:09:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[1:09:45] <+konekoryugamine> Boom
[1:09:47] <%TheGamerMaldito> Oh, I know this legend, you have to answer "you are average" BibleThump
[1:09:52] <alephalpha> she's kuchisaki onna
[1:09:54] <+konekoryugamine> I thought that didn't work
[1:09:58] <Alias_McDoe> guarantees attacks only
[1:10:00] <ManfredA> @TheGamerMaldito this game has the tp ghost too
[1:10:00] <+SuperKirby24> so if you fuck a human centipede is it just the one person or everyone Kappa
[1:10:02] <+konekoryugamine> YOu need to DOOOOOOOODGE
[1:10:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> not a good idea generally
[1:10:05] <blackkanye> They are two seperate healthbars
[1:10:07] <alephalpha> yeah if you call her ugly or beatiful get wrecked
[1:10:08] <+Fierbras> The damage type is on the top left
[1:10:09] <Dhurkst> @TheGamerMaldito or give her some hard candy, apparently
[1:10:12] <+konekoryugamine> YOU CAN DODGE
[1:10:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Reason is a health type
[1:10:15] <Thirtine> actually not a bad idae if you heal with the lump
[1:10:18] <+konekoryugamine> NO!
[1:10:19] <BoneofMalkav> She does 2 Damage to Both Stamina and Reason
[1:10:20] <Blastotron> Swing Away
[1:10:21] <+lethallunacyx> She'll really get a-head in life
[1:10:24] <+PhantasmaXD> @konekoryugamine shhhh
[1:10:24] <+konekoryugamine> You can't just keep hitting her!!
[1:10:25] <Doodle_Taco> Do combo
[1:10:30] <RyanTheRecluse> look at the enemy stats top left
[1:10:30] <lotharrio> Looks like you can just barely get in that bottom offensive action, too.
[1:10:31] <DrGhostJelly> I'm guessing it has 14 hp now?
[1:10:36] <Dr_Mooose> ye
[1:10:37] <alephalpha> they can win this
[1:10:37] <glaciusinfinite> Three forms of health
[1:10:37] <+PhantasmaXD> :D
[1:10:38] <ManfredA> 24
[1:10:39] <+konekoryugamine> She takes 2 Reason and 2 Stamina!
[1:10:40] <Sweetangy021> The top left shows her hp what damage she does and pwr determines your chance to hit them and vice versa
[1:10:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Keep doing that
[1:10:43] <+konekoryugamine> YOu have to defend!!
[1:10:44] <BakerBrute> Super winnable
[1:10:45] <NemokillerV> @DrGhostJelly ye
[1:10:47] <+konekoryugamine> YOU LOSE!
[1:10:52] <Renkage> Window seems to be cut off a bit. That on purpose?
[1:10:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It does
[1:10:53] <blackkanye> It is a game over bro
[1:10:53] <tattleworm> the top left says what kind of damage the enemy does, she does -2 to all
[1:10:53] <+konekoryugamine> When your stamina runs out, you lose!
[1:10:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> You go nuts (GAME OVER)
[1:10:55] <laguerrilha> She can give head x3. She would be popular in Japan
[1:10:57] <+jiggy_snipe> naw
[1:11:00] <+konekoryugamine> The god has won when your reason is gone!
[1:11:00] <+kapcommunist> chill
[1:11:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> ! FRENZY !
[1:11:02] <+jiggy_snipe> keep swinging
[1:11:03] <YakumoYomi> Both stamina and reason are life bars
[1:11:04] <+PhantasmaXD> @laguerrilha BIG FACTS
[1:11:04] <%Vegaburd> Vegaburd subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Woolz, your Doom LP was amazing. Keep that content flowing my mans
[1:11:05] <%ekodrop> what happened to the bat
[1:11:05] <ManfredA> yeah she's eldritch, not ghost
[1:11:07] <+DiabloDeAzul> you already did the ritual
[1:11:08] <BakerBrute> @konekoryugamine You can actually pretty easily justify just swinging out every turn
[1:11:08] <ssmotzer> Why do magic when you have a bat?
[1:11:19] <+konekoryugamine> That's why there's a dodge option!
[1:11:20] <+DiabloDeAzul> @ekodrop bat's equipped
[1:11:20] <ManfredA> magic is for fighting ghosts
[1:11:25] <Tucker0603> just murder
[1:11:26] <RyanTheRecluse> that works
[1:11:28] <%ekodrop> oh finally
[1:11:28] <+jiggy_snipe> only offense
[1:11:33] <+konekoryugamine> Oh dang it.
[1:11:37] <+konekoryugamine> NO
[1:11:40] <alephalpha> ayyyy
[1:11:42] <adamisfruit> Just keep attacking
[1:11:42] <mybigmeech> Rip
[1:11:42] <Dr_Mooose> oh boy
[1:11:42] <YakumoYomi> Two turns left
[1:11:43] <Crombells> use up all your time, prepping is key
[1:11:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Do prep
[1:11:48] <reonome> DODGE
[1:11:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:11:49] <Tucker0603> prep and murder
[1:11:49] <RyanTheRecluse> you can take 2 more hits
[1:11:50] <hntronium> No such thing as accuracy
[1:11:50] <+solzan2000> o_o
[1:11:50] <Alias_McDoe> bawkOmega
[1:11:51] <+konekoryugamine> DODGE - PREP - HIT
[1:11:53] <+PhantasmaXD> @konekoryugamine let them figure it out
[1:11:56] <+PatMorgana> shes almost dead!
[1:11:57] <alephalpha> 2 turn clock
[1:11:58] <+arknodem> Prep will gaurentee your next attack.
[1:12:00] <Dr_Mooose> not looking too good
[1:12:02] <glaciusinfinite> Ooh that image
[1:12:06] <rubbishbinge> 2 turns until dead
[1:12:09] <+konekoryugamine> Sorry, I'm getting that anxiety feeling again.
[1:12:10] <+kapcommunist> wheres the cry option?
[1:12:12] <+konekoryugamine> I gotta stop.
[1:12:16] <blackkanye> I mean if they do 1 damage brace lowers it to 0
[1:12:16] <alephalpha> this game is all dps races umnless you're using dogde with good dex
[1:12:17] <Galacta_Pieta> I dont think she is nearly dead, the hp is cut off
[1:12:19] <+konekoryugamine> And there's no cry aoption.
[1:12:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> High damage is the best form of mitigation Kappa
[1:12:20] <blackkanye> so not in that situation
[1:12:21] <+TheRisingPride> Oh man, I just noticed she uglier now
[1:12:24] <+konekoryugamine> AOPTION SURE
[1:12:26] <+Mendin> * b u t. n o b o d y. c a m e.
[1:12:26] <+DiabloDeAzul> woolie play like you're in dark souls
[1:12:27] <mybigmeech> Oh god, she looks worse now somehow
[1:12:27] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Woolie good explanation
[1:12:28] <reonome> she has 14 hp lol
[1:12:29] <lotharrio> Prep SAtk Aim Atk
[1:12:30] <+konekoryugamine> OH GOD
[1:12:30] <laguerrilha> but normally in games against bosses you want to defend
[1:12:34] <cochramd1992> she way uglier
[1:12:35] <+Ryu_R> :p :p :p
[1:12:40] <+jiggy_snipe> this Sekiro not Dark Souls
[1:12:41] <%Double_Tap_That> If you look below the enemy name, you can see the enemy's current health and damage they do per attack.
[1:12:41] <@Solidus_113> never stop going in
[1:12:43] <+konekoryugamine> I did NOT expect her to be ulgies!
[1:12:46] <GKannel> offense sometimes is the best defense
[1:12:47] <@Solidus_113> SUUUUUUUUUUUPER DAAAAAAASH
[1:12:48] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @wydamn
[1:12:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Prepping is also good

[1:13:25] <TDAWS_MP132> nope LUL
[1:13:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> More or less completed the tutorial at least
[1:13:26] <%allups> rip
[1:13:26] <+PapermanXD> AGAIN
[1:13:28] <+konekoryugamine> Yep.
[1:13:29] <alephalpha> should have dps raced from the start
[1:13:30] <+paladinstarbuster> I BLAME WOOLIE
[1:13:31] <Doodle_Taco> Nah
[1:13:32] <Tucker0603> no, just hard murder
[1:13:33] <+DiabloDeAzul> woolie pls
[1:13:33] <+konekoryugamine> Defense works well in this game.
[1:13:33] <RockLobster52> Dodge is worth using
[1:13:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> It absolutely would've, Woolie. Too much unga, too much bunga.
[1:13:37] <%allups> it wouldve
[1:13:41] <alephalpha> dodge is good especially with aiko
[1:13:43] <+schlager087> so are you supposed to defend when she raises her shit?
[1:13:48] <Manwad> defense in this game is great
[1:13:51] <Dhurkst> LUL LUL LUL
[1:13:51] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:13:52] <cochramd1992> LUL
[1:13:54] <blackkanye> Defense is super good in this game. Especially against 1 damage enemies
[1:13:54] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[1:13:55] <powerprotoman> shes right too
[1:13:55] <reonome> yeah its woolie's fault LUL
[1:13:57] <KatabolicRage> honestly this game tends towards DPS races
[1:13:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds good to me :)
[1:14:02] <%allups> the truths hurts
[1:14:02] <+paladinstarbuster> SUPER RIGHT
[1:14:04] <rubbishbinge> not wrong
[1:14:08] <OkamiDude15> she's actually right
[1:14:11] <+konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus The actions to defend are a good mix in between the offensive actions. Dodge, then prep the attack, then go in for a stricke
[1:14:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> YES YOU DO
[1:14:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Truuu
[1:14:13] <theKingRamses> you do know her hp
[1:14:13] <KatabolicRage> you know EXACTLY how much life she has, it's in the top left
[1:14:14] <reonome> you can see her HP right there though
[1:14:15] <+Pyroclase> she does have a healthbar
[1:14:16] <RyanTheRecluse> look at those log entries
[1:14:17] <blackkanye> But you do know her hp
[1:14:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> SHE HAS HEALTH
[1:14:20] <GKannel> you know her health
[1:14:21] <+konekoryugamine> If you nonsense attack, you die instantly.
[1:14:22] <Mr_Rakjo> THe life is at the corner top left of the screan
[1:14:25] <+jiggy_snipe> I think the life is cut off for them
[1:14:26] <weirdducks> you can see her hp on the left
[1:14:26] <Crombells> her HP was visible
[1:14:27] <rubbishbinge> Your setup is cropping out HP
[1:14:27] <+Ryu_R> its only listed on screen :)
[1:14:28] <Tucker0603> you can CLEARLY see her HP
[1:14:28] <lotharrio> Woolie you gotta learn to read more. The boss' HP was in the upper left corner.
[1:14:28] <+BKNPham> the hp is cut off
[1:14:28] <Manwad> did they not see the damage types
[1:14:28] <derap41> Losing is fun
[1:14:31] <laguerrilha> when a boss is doing something different in games you want to get back and def
[1:14:32] <+jiggy_snipe> but it's in the top left
[1:14:33] <ImasukyLomae> Her hp was on screen
[1:14:36] <glaciusinfinite> you can see health at the top left
[1:14:36] <+Pyroclase> it's misaligned
[1:14:38] <Iam_Dead> you can see life at top left and damage she does under
[1:14:39] <derap41> Dwarf Fortress mentality
[1:14:40] <+Ryu_R> YEAH SKULLGIRLS
[1:14:40] <Dhurkst> Look at it like Dark Souls: unga leads to death
[1:14:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> HP WAS ON SCREEN
[1:14:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @WoolieVersus HP is on the top left
[1:14:43] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah that's a thing that happens.
[1:14:48] <RyanTheRecluse> that's weird
[1:14:51] <+konekoryugamine> Skullgirls?

[1:15:00] <reonome> WOOLIE'S FAULT
[1:15:03] <BackwardCap> Fighting Herds PogChamp
[1:15:03] <+DiabloDeAzul> it centers itself after every screen transition
[1:15:04] <+SuperKirby24> botch LUL

[1:15:05] <+jiggy_snipe> Them Fighting Herds

[1:15:10] <laguerrilha> TFH
[1:15:16] <+jiggy_snipe> BIG RECYCLING BIN
[1:15:19] <+SuperKirby24> fighting herdsa nice
[1:15:19] <%TheGamerMaldito> Alt+Enter maybe?
[1:15:20] <derap41> All of Woolie's porn is there
[1:15:20] <+Mendin> World of Digital Horror
[1:15:21] <%Theycallmenerf> Balls exposed
[1:15:22] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah good call
[1:15:23] <laguerrilha> Look at all that tomboy porn!
[1:15:24] <ZeeJiggle> Yo was that a Wolf Among Us wallpaper I saw?
[1:15:25] <ManfredA> also this is an adventure game, look at everything on the screen
[1:15:25] <nerdblase> Skullgirls party never stopped.
[1:15:31] <ManfredA> don't hyperfocus on one part
[1:15:32] <bassoontyphoon> hi everyone in quarantine
[1:15:41] <masterfire23> fetish folders exposed ?
[1:15:42] <+konekoryugamine> So yeah, defense is important.
[1:15:53] <derap41> Has Kirby always been there?
[1:15:54] <ManfredA> THIS GAME LIKES BIG COWARDICE
[1:15:59] <powerprotoman> woolie its horror
[1:16:00] <+Fierbras> Your lose condition is Stamina = 0, Reason = 0, and/or doom is 100%.
[1:16:02] <ManfredA> cowards live
[1:16:02] <hntronium> Cowardice is for death
[1:16:06] <%allups> but most horror gams are all about tht shit
[1:16:08] <Renkage> Running away is SUPER powerful. As long as you can sacrifice the DOOM
[1:16:09] <Iam_Dead> game loves coward
[1:16:11] <+DiabloDeAzul> Woolie chill, there is no joysticc
[1:16:11] <arkv01> no worries, it's fun to cruise and bruise
[1:16:12] <RyanTheRecluse> yup
[1:16:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can win fast or die slow
[1:16:15] <tattleworm> using brace on a 1 damage attack results in no damage, you can lame it out pretty hard
[1:16:20] <Manwad> It is exactly that thing
[1:16:22] <wydamn> Joker mod incoming
[1:16:22] <blackkanye> It was, but I don't know if you can avoid the injury it causes
[1:16:24] <Dr_Mooose> cowards live, heroes die
[1:16:29] <reonome> you were gonna die either way
[1:16:33] <blackkanye> The scissor raise thing specifically cause an injury
[1:16:37] <hntronium> You can win fast and die fast or you can not win and die
[1:16:46] <de1ete_forever> my toilet paper fort has it's own sub basement panic room
[1:16:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:49] <HellsCherry> I love this game wrecking woolie's gaming philosophy
[1:16:51] <+jiggy_snipe> also Punch Mom should click on some of the conditions like Cursed and Concussion just to see what they do
[1:16:53] <Iam_Dead> @woolieversus when she readied the scissors that's a big attack callout.
[1:16:54] <laguerrilha> This layout is messy. Its not your fault
[1:16:54] <ManfredA> this game is about resource management
[1:16:59] <illTemperedSeaBass> Those games aren't horror games. In horror games cowardice being the winning strat is the running trope.
[1:17:03] <lotharrio> Learn to double-click!
[1:17:04] <ManfredA> wasting too much resource on a fight is bad
[1:17:11] <wydamn> @de1ete_forever My toilet paper armor will absorb any microbes.
[1:17:12] <ManfredA> cowards only waste doom
[1:17:12] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus Punchmom, look up a youtube series of a literal 71 year old grandma playing Skyrim
[1:17:12] <+jiggy_snipe> it's cool, we get it
[1:17:14] <+BKNPham> yea it's not your fault
[1:17:18] <derap41> This is well known phenoma
[1:17:19] <Prevot> punch grandma
[1:17:20] <+Mendin> She is a shining motivation
[1:17:20] <+Despera__> It's a rougelike! You're supposed to die
[1:17:20] <+TheRisingPride> It's a pretty information heavy UI
[1:17:27] <rubbishbinge> its ok you tried :)
[1:17:28] <+therabbles> BloodTrail BloodTrail
[1:17:29] <OozieStream> Her raising the scissors means she's going to slit your mouth.
[1:17:29] <bassoontyphoon> this type of game needs you to die to learn
[1:17:31] <simulationbard> Yeah this game's a little dense
[1:17:32] <MasterDecoder> You're learning, it's fine, text based games are weird anyway
[1:17:32] <laguerrilha> i play a lot of rpgs and this layout was VERY confusing
[1:17:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Are we not all dummies at one point?
[1:17:34] <blackkanye> It is a rougelike so it is fine
[1:17:37] <Tucker0603> so ya know enemy HP is on the left side of the screen. but it indeed a learning experience
[1:17:38] <%allups> i cannot imagine how hard it is to get into games as an adult
[1:17:39] <+BigBruthaThunda> It's a rougelite, so you're meant to die a bunch
[1:17:39] <YakumoYomi> The layout is visually noisy, so don't worry about it. You did alright.
[1:17:40] <+Fierbras> World of Horror Monsters have Health and Damage types. You can see that information on the top left of the combat screen.
[1:17:41] <Dr_Mooose> the UI is pretty busy
[1:17:43] <+jiggy_snipe> well it's a rougelike so dying is expected
[1:17:43] <OkamiDude15> the layout is kinda all over the place but once you learn its fine
[1:17:43] <wydamn> @Mendin Is that a real thing? I need to find that.
[1:17:44] <derap41> Now Do Dark Souls
[1:17:44] <+lethallunacyx> This is kind of a die more often than not kinda game
[1:17:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> <3
[1:17:45] <%Vegaburd> Your a boomer!
[1:17:47] <hntronium> Woolie
[1:17:47] <+thatskindaraven> Just joined, is it starting or did I miss itr
[1:17:48] <$Noponiz> it'S a roguelike so failure is literally intended
[1:17:48] <tattleworm> that would've been the end of the tutorial, better to play the game proper now
[1:18:03] <hntronium> Woolie's philosophy of getting in there is not wrong for this game
[1:18:03] <reonome> the game's UI is pretty overwhelming ngl
[1:18:11] <ManfredA> pro tip: when you're better, beat her without doing the ritual to get something really nice
[1:18:28] <RyanTheRecluse> you can do the 2nd run now, you don't have anything left to learn from that tutorial
[1:18:44] <%optimasmaximas> this was real cool seein punchmom play
[1:18:44] <OkamiDude15> @thatskindaraven punch mom died on tutorial boss fight and woolie is fixing the capture is what you missed
[1:19:18] <derap41> Dark Souls does it really interestingly
[1:19:40] <@Solidus_113> we on a CRT
[1:19:43] <TurtleButter> Stylish
[1:19:48] <RyanTheRecluse> @manfreda I got that ending by accident because I stopped the chalk design when the log said it should be correct and lied to me.
[1:19:51] <Dr_Mooose> I like this
[1:19:51] <+jiggy_snipe> looks nice
[1:19:54] <hntronium> You can change the color if you want
[1:19:55] <+Mendin> Switch to 2bit mode for crisper graphics
[1:20:00] <ManfredA> @Solidus_113 it's an old monitor, you can pull even further back
[1:20:12] <%allups> at least in DS u can always just get stronger
[1:20:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, you got this
[1:20:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just git gud 4Head
[1:20:22] <lotharrio> It's mostly just addition.
[1:20:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Couples playthrough lol
[1:20:29] <UncleDicky> awwww
[1:20:31] <wydamn> Woolie, Don't let her talk you into making this an Omnikron
[1:20:31] <%optimasmaximas> co-op PogChamp
[1:20:31] <Renkage> I mean...Implying Woolie has the brain for it Kappa
[1:20:32] <+paladinstarbuster> U CAN DO IT
[1:20:32] <@Solidus_113> @ManfredA yes... a CRT
[1:20:39] <Prevot> world of backdowns
[1:20:39] <%allups> so woolie plays the gameplay
[1:20:48] <theKingRamses> woolie do combo
[1:20:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie there is health in the top left
[1:20:50] <hntronium> Just backseat each other
[1:20:53] <+DiabloDeAzul> lifeline Woolie LUL
[1:20:55] <presque> It's not like he's gonna play faster, it's still rpg Woolie
[1:20:57] <Turning2Dust> I believe in Punch-Mom's ability to punch
[1:20:57] <+jiggy_snipe> I wanna see you mess up together :)
[1:20:59] <ZeeJiggle> No see Chat wants to be the backseat
[1:21:03] <OozieStream> A CRT so you can always play Melee!
[1:21:09] <%allups> i think she can handle the combat
[1:21:12] <ZeeJiggle> It's a rollercoaster here
[1:21:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> DO EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
[1:21:24] <KatabolicRage> just remmember you can take your time, mouse over and click things, etc
[1:21:25] <ManfredA> it's mostly just learning what works
[1:21:29] <ManfredA> patience is key
[1:21:30] <KatabolicRage> all very much turn based
[1:21:55] <ManfredA> like spiritual can be almost entirely ignored against non-ghosts
[1:21:58] <cochramd1992> chat always wants to backseat
[1:22:02] <+Valentttine> is that the toyota deja vu car??
[1:22:26] <lotharrio> Big coward runaway is a strong option in random encounters.
[1:22:29] <+Valentttine> y'all know what i mean
[1:22:42] <OkamiDude15> yeah looks and probably is an 86
[1:22:54] <Dr_Mooose> enemies hurt
[1:22:58] <Doodle_Taco> This game is hard
[1:22:59] <+Mendin> You were unlucky in that all events and the main enemy both did Reason damage
[1:23:07] <RyanTheRecluse> So defense/dodge is actually good.
[1:23:10] <ManfredA> this is a roguelike so sometimes
[1:23:13] <ManfredA> you just get screwed
[1:23:16] <weirdducks> enemies in this game do a ton of damage
[1:23:17] <Dr_Mooose> they do not hold back
[1:23:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, this game is intended to be tricky
[1:23:20] <lotharrio> The double-concussion ruined you.
[1:23:21] <djazo> @WoolieVersus you need to prep more
[1:23:25] <theKingRamses> you leave the encounter battle scarred
[1:23:26] <+lethallunacyx> Dodge/def can be good depends on the enemy
[1:23:28] <OkamiDude15> rougelikes are meant to be replayed alot so yeah
[1:23:37] <ManfredA> like yeah you can just get fucked in this game and nothing you can do
[1:23:44] <%allups> its a roguelike so u are ganna keep dying
[1:23:46] <Crombells> @lotharrio don't concussions only decrease knowledge?
[1:23:49] <+lethallunacyx> and rng is big here
[1:23:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:23:59] <wydamn> LUL
[1:24:04] <beatie_g> Did I miss the first run?
[1:24:09] <RyanTheRecluse> double concussion just drops knowledge, doesn't effect combat unless you're running a spell caster
[1:24:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
[1:24:15] <wydamn> DO THE NEXT ONE
[1:24:17] <OkamiDude15> you missed the tutorial run
[1:24:20] <+jiggy_snipe> when you're not a gamer it makes sense that it could be overwhelming
[1:24:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Already completed the first, really
[1:24:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[1:24:25] <Doodle_Taco> Do extracurriculae activity
[1:24:26] <de1ete_forever> in all fairness, the P3 party turn base is sketchy at times
[1:24:29] <+Mendin> Ambient
[1:24:29] <ZeeJiggle> Spooky mood
[1:24:33] <+jiggy_snipe> mood set
[1:24:33] <cochramd1992> imagine not being a gamer Kappa
[1:24:34] <Prevot> comfy stream
[1:24:36] <Dhurkst> Big spoops!
[1:24:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @de1ete_forever Marin fucking Karin
[1:24:36] <lotharrio> @Crombells You're right, it was the other one. She got a damage over time effect.
[1:24:38] <%allups> sexy
[1:24:40] <Dr_Mooose> VS after dark
[1:24:43] <ZeeJiggle> And hey that looks fine on the capture
[1:24:47] <RyanTheRecluse> extracurricular activity would be your best bet
[1:24:47] <UncleDicky> SpoOoOoKy
[1:24:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> 2ND ONE
[1:24:51] <ManfredA> she is tho
[1:24:52] <fabo_joyful> Vs dark-mood
[1:24:54] <RyanTheRecluse> awww
[1:24:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU WERE 99% DONE
[1:24:57] <Crombells> @lotharrio the curse also only affects spellcasting
[1:24:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> Heads up, HEALTH in top left
[1:24:58] <MassConnect> woolie vs electric bills
[1:25:00] <+lethallunacyx> also there is some min/maxing when it comes to damage output and again it depends on the chars strengths
[1:25:05] <Doodle_Taco> She totally is
[1:25:08] <%Ecchigun> 2nd optionn
[1:25:10] <Thirtine> nope, you did do this lul
[1:25:13] <Tucker0603> yes you did
[1:25:17] <Ner234> You did this LUL
[1:25:19] <Turning2Dust> Shit's fucked - The Game
[1:25:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:25:22] <cochramd1992> mmmmmm TITTIES
[1:25:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> This tutoral is mostly the same
[1:25:25] <lotharrio> @Crombells Well then I guess I'm wrong /
[1:25:26] <@akuda_bar> mmmmm GURL
[1:25:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> 👀
[1:25:32] <blackkanye> My first test mod might be making a few charisma weapons
[1:25:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> 2nd is for after tutorial
[1:25:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The tutorial is complete, you died literally at the end
[1:25:44] <RyanTheRecluse> the tutorial ended with that fight woolie
[1:25:44] <+Pyroclase> the second option is best for a first playthrough
[1:25:45] <blackkanye> Because that is the only stat that has none besides FND
[1:25:46] <reonome> you were like 99% done
[1:25:48] <ManfredA> it's a regular case
[1:25:49] <+jiggy_snipe> no one forgets that personality Kappa
[1:25:52] <hntronium> 2nd is basically bigger tutorial
[1:25:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah, do the tutorial again to get a grip
[1:25:52] <KatabolicRage> right arrow on text
[1:25:52] <%SpaghettiTime44> This game is strangely enthralling
[1:25:57] <KatabolicRage> aah they skipped it again
[1:25:58] <Turning2Dust> Get through the first mystery, it's a good microcosm to help with the classic mode
[1:26:05] <Doodle_Taco> You learned everything there was to learn
[1:26:18] <KatabolicRage> it aint lying about this being a small snippet of the main game
[1:26:19] <waffleandman> q
[1:26:20] <+Fierbras> Lets just do this as a refresh run
[1:26:23] <@Solidus_113> this one is just a tutorial
[1:26:25] <RyanTheRecluse> the tutorial is just one mystery
[1:26:29] <+Mendin> You died on the final boss of the tutorial, yes
[1:26:37] <cochramd1992> But can she apply it?
[1:26:47] <RyanTheRecluse> you can exit on the lower right settings button
[1:26:47] <ManfredA> Q

[1:46:16] <%DensityD> 1
[1:46:22] <Prevot> the curious case of the contagious corona
[1:46:24] <KatabolicRage> Patient Zero is like a sidequest thing
[1:46:31] <%Run44forrest> there should be more incentives for getting the good ending to mysteries
[1:46:32] <wydamn> There are systems, here.
[1:46:35] <somekindofgnome> This music always mindfloods me
[1:46:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paitent Zero = sidequest for more EXP
[1:46:43] <KatabolicRage> it can also have effects on the overall mysteyr
[1:46:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> NOPE
[1:46:45] <coracor> no
[1:46:46] <coracor> wrong
[1:46:47] <TDAWS_MP132> nope
[1:46:48] <NeroInfinite> NOPE
[1:46:48] <RyanTheRecluse> nope
[1:46:50] <Doodle_Taco> NO
[1:46:51] <wrydiculous> oh this menu needs some time to explain
[1:46:54] <+Mendin> 2
[1:46:54] <GarbageNirvana> apatCrazyhead
[1:46:55] <GarbageNirvana> er
[1:46:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Generally speaking, you'll want to complete the sidequest there
[1:46:57] <lotharrio> That does not say Village, Woolie.
[1:46:57] <%DensityD> psaWrong
[1:46:58] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> big NOPE
[1:46:59] <nothuzad> no its a "sidequest"
[1:47:00] <Ner234> NotLikeThis Woolie
[1:47:03] <%DensityD> psaCrazyhead
[1:47:05] <%TheGamerMaldito> The Spooky Mystery of: Terrifying Testicular Torsion BibleThump
[1:47:10] <TDAWS_MP132> the patient zero thing is a side objective
[1:47:10] <glaciusinfinite> no that wrong
[1:47:11] <GarbageNirvana> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:47:14] <powerprotoman> "investiage village" woolie "click the school option"
[1:47:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> PATIENT ZERO IS SIDEQUEST. DO IT
[1:47:17] <NeroInfinite> screaming in my skiiiin
[1:47:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Patient Zero = sidequest
[1:47:18] <Crombells> Patient Zero is an optional objective
[1:47:18] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus The circle is the main quest, the sticky note is a -side- quest
[1:47:32] <+lethallunacyx> To be fair it's not very clear
[1:47:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> THAT TAKES TIME
[1:47:41] <NeroInfinite> The side quest helps out tho
[1:47:44] <RyanTheRecluse> village is the ten gate down the bottom, is f9r a side quest to get more information
[1:47:54] <Nekros4442> Read the side quest
[1:48:06] <KatabolicRage> the circle is the main objective, you can go to other places for whatever reason
[1:48:08] <blackkanye> Some endings are triggered by the side quests
[1:48:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Circle = main quest, Patient Zero = side quest
[1:48:13] <%DensityD> no weapon
[1:48:13] <glaciusinfinite> Can you here it? Chat is screaming...
[1:48:17] <%DensityD> no knowledge
[1:48:20] <%DensityD> no nothing
[1:48:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Circle=main. Patient Zero is sidequest that helps.
[1:48:26] <BoneofMalkav> Also Side Quests on your right can help you with the mystery
[1:48:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Circle to complete main mission, but you can technically go anywhere
[1:48:33] <wrydiculous> circle is hard progression
[1:48:35] <RyanTheRecluse> Chat(nothing)
[1:48:47] <NeroInfinite> Chat bleeds words like you and I bleed red
[1:48:51] <Timesteel> check the locations as well some have shops
[1:48:52] <MooseoneLivedhere> please someone read the chat
[1:49:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie is adamant not to get help
[1:49:10] <+Mendin> Call Reggie
[1:49:26] <%DensityD> currently threat level: white. not yet threat level: black.
[1:49:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE
[1:49:34] <KatabolicRage> Patient Zero is the sidequest
[1:49:35] <+mczarklesby> You cry out to help... but nobody reads. bleedPurple
[1:49:35] <coracor> the sticky note is the side quest
[1:49:36] <wrydiculous> patient zero

[1:49:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> CIRCLE IS MAIN. PATIENT ZERO IS SIDEQUEST
[1:49:45] <wrydiculous> patient zero is the sidequest
[1:49:45] <Crombells> Patient Zero is the sidequest
[1:49:46] <meromaromiro> Patient Zero is the sidequest IE investigate village twice
[1:49:48] <Dr_Mooose> Woolie...
[1:49:48] <+lethallunacyx> Honestly on this one it's better not to do the side quest
[1:49:53] <Ozavic> Patient Zero = Side Quest
[1:49:54] <MooseoneLivedhere> oh that bepping really hurts me ears
[1:49:55] <RyanTheRecluse> we need Reggie to Coolaid man through the wall, phone in hand and channelling the chat.
[1:50:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> HOORAY
[1:50:03] <%DensityD> they have learned
[1:50:03] <reonome> woolie did you mean to post 5 podcast clips at once
[1:50:03] <+Pyroclase> the "sidequest" gives you a better ending most of the time
[1:50:07] <GarbageNirvana> Circle is main investigation
[1:50:18] <%DensityD> THAT'S A CUTE CHIBI
[1:50:31] <%DensityD> so much cool mangaka shit in this
[1:50:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ryantherecluse If Reggie shows up, the number of eyes in the room will be multiplied infinitely
[1:50:42] <Timesteel> downtown and seaside have shops as well
[1:50:55] <BoneofMalkav> ^
[1:50:56] <RyanTheRecluse> you can investigate anything else to explore/get more encounters
[1:51:02] <+lethallunacyx> 6 billion sets of eyes
[1:51:05] <@Solidus_113> Just know all information at all times
[1:51:09] <wrydiculous> To be fair, first timers will be stumped at this UI
[1:51:13] <wydamn> FUCK SAFETY

[1:52:08] <%Run44forrest> whats a moon nacho
[1:52:11] <lotharrio> You always blame them. They only make it worse and they NEVER get cool enough powers to justify it.
[1:52:13] <RyanTheRecluse> @generalscpatton Yeah, Reggie's eyes on the inside are our eyes.
[1:52:14] <meromaromiro> Hitler is real can you bla
[1:52:15] <ZeeR01> I just wanted a quite life in morioh
[1:52:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> You can still blame the cult if the real gods they follow literally bestow chaos and insanity.
[1:52:16] <Dova573> Human traitor woolie strikes again

[1:54:58] <Ozavic> Remember, Punchmom is out of their element, we gotta be nice
[1:55:00] <Ne0classical> Its actually sometimes better to not use the dust imo.
[1:55:02] <lotharrio> I'd want a weapon before I start investigating
[1:55:04] <%Run44forrest> chat she will die if she goes for ending A hasMods

[1:55:37] <Crombells> "easier"
[1:55:40] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus also you can click all these locations to see what's in them before actually deciding
[1:55:40] <Alias_McDoe> you can buy a weapon
[1:55:48] <Renkage> @WoolieVersus Every location has places of interest on the left side. Right next to ITEM STORAGE
[1:55:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Downtown and buy weapon?

[1:57:44] <illTemperedSeaBass> @WoolieVersus I think that's a reduction to the MODIFIER. Say you had a +5 to the roll, if you needed to roll a 19, a 14 or above would work, because you have a +5 modifier. -1 modifier is a bad thing. Means you have a +4 instead.

[1:58:05] <anar_bael> camera ain't bad
[1:58:06] <hntronium> BUY COMPASS
[1:58:07] <VJdarkworld> Acquire Currency
[1:58:07] <BoneofMalkav> Camera good for Knowledge Character

[1:58:17] <+lethallunacyx> compass will replace ring
[1:58:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yes
[1:58:19] <NeroInfinite> Ye
[1:58:20] <coracor> LUL
[1:58:22] <MaverickJoker> idk
[1:58:22] <+McSnazzyPants> skill checks in this game work by trying to roll lower than your stat number. threat level will add to your roll, making it harder to succeed
[1:58:22] <anar_bael> Boop dog on nose
[1:58:23] <ImasukyLomae> compass yes
[1:58:24] <%DensityD> exp boost, nice
[1:58:24] <Ne0classical> Cigarettes are trash

[1:58:27] <glaciusinfinite> DONT BUY ANYMORE
[1:58:27] <blackkanye> Compass is great early on
[1:58:38] <fayestra> PogChamp
[1:58:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> but cool
[1:58:42] <reonome> YIKES
[1:58:44] <hntronium> DOOMS
[1:58:44] <+Mendin> Since this is basically the start of the game, the compass will give big payoffs
[1:58:45] <glaciusinfinite> HAVING 0 FUNDS IS REAL BAD
[1:58:46] <plo135> Get compaa use ring
[1:58:49] <blackkanye> Only when you enter
[1:58:50] <RyanTheRecluse> doom st 100% is a bad thing
[1:58:52] <ManfredA> they can use the ring
[1:58:53] <ManfredA> it's fine

[1:59:22] <%Run44forrest> having 0 funds is fine its just -3 stamina or reason or +5 doom
[1:59:26] <RyanTheRecluse> remember to equip
[1:59:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Compass and flashlight are the BEST ITEMS
[1:59:35] <rubbishbinge> eat the ring
[1:59:37] <Ne0classical> Sell ring, go to seaside and buy a hammer to kill god
[1:59:50] <+LunarDensetsu> Discoun item

[1:59:55] <tattleworm> camera goes in slot b, you can equip that too
[1:59:55] <Dhurkst> naisu ringu

[1:59:57] <wrydiculous> gain back your 2 funds
[1:59:58] <sexdrugsvideogames> i wish this game was dopewars
[1:59:58] <Nekros4442> Make sure you "Use" the ring not "sell"

[2:03:13] <blackkanye> This package was made for me
[2:03:13] <alephalpha> too smart to look
[2:03:13] <%DensityD> that intoxicating aroma
[2:03:18] <MaverickJoker> too much strawberry jam
[2:03:18] <rubbishbinge> it was spaghetti
[2:03:21] <Crombells> It's just blood! There's blood in the box!
[2:03:22] <+Mendin> Woolie please put the camera on
[2:03:27] <+jiggy_snipe> remember DOOM
[2:03:32] <waffleandman> sometimes you win the game when you think you cant
[2:03:33] <ManfredA> it's just bonus events
[2:03:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's random events
[2:03:40] <sexdrugsvideogames> it was a package from the cult
[2:03:40] <ManfredA> it's not actually helping the investigation
[2:03:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Big random events
[2:03:45] <Alias_McDoe> it's alright, you pased the check, see every event as something bad that you need to go throught with the least damage taken
[2:03:50] <lotharrio> Equip that CAMERA
[2:04:16] <qwesta6> doom tho
[2:04:16] <+Matto424> well it's uh japan so good luck with that
[2:04:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good luck with that
[2:04:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> americans...
[2:04:19] <Dr_Mooose> yeah, you wish
[2:04:21] <NeroInfinite> Guns are actually not great
[2:04:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No gods, no masters, only GUN
[2:04:22] <MaverickJoker> does the camera go on slot b or c?
[2:04:22] <TDAWS_MP132> just go through the areas and learn for now
[2:04:24] <blackkanye> Dex means you would best use something dex related
[2:04:24] <Crombells> how you gonna get a gun in JAPAN?
[2:04:26] <ManfredA> I've only gotten a gun once
[2:04:26] <Alias_McDoe> there's a store on the seaside
[2:04:26] <+kapcommunist> this game needs more super shotguns
[2:04:28] <wrydiculous> Woolie remember this is japan
[2:04:32] <+jiggy_snipe> they're canadian tho Kappa
[2:04:33] <+ItsRatman> how's a gun gonna help you shoot a ghost
[2:04:36] <MaverickJoker> ah B
[2:04:37] <RyanTheRecluse> @woolieversus There is a very small chance of getting a gun
[2:04:38] <alephalpha> if you wanted a weapon should have gone to the docks while you had money
[2:04:39] <ManfredA> they can be good @NeroInfinite but you gotta hope you get bullets
[2:04:44] <MaxXtreme23> Wow, holy shit I went to sleep and i come back to see the stream's only 2 hours in damn
[2:04:44] <Laecerelius> Raise that Dex and get a katana to Virgil all over the unknowable horrors!
[2:04:48] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames they're canadian
[2:04:49] <MaverickJoker> wait, they do have cocaine?
[2:04:49] <blackkanye> guns are only realyl good when you have a per build. You can do way better than a gun with a weapon for your highest stat while boosting your highest stat
[2:04:51] <+SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:04:57] <+lethallunacyx> Oh thank the eldritch lords
[2:04:58] <+jiggy_snipe> lol

[2:05:05] <ManfredA> KANA
[2:05:09] <Alias_McDoe> there are, but they are hard to get
[2:05:11] <lotharrio> Remember Persona 1, one of the first quests is to just get guns for everyone.
[2:05:11] <sexdrugsvideogames> as a continent maybe?
[2:05:11] <BoneofMalkav> Not to mention, this is 198X Japan LUL

[2:05:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:05:22] <tattleworm> neighbor button currently doesn't do anything afaik

[2:05:57] <lotharrio> Oh that's an Elder Sign on her door. Kana's protected from uhh... Flying Polyps?
[2:05:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:05:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Huh, that took no time
[2:05:58] <hntronium> Plus 1 dooms
[2:05:58] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames no, they don't

[2:06:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> Someone must have picked up that ring your dropped LUL
[2:06:23] <ManfredA> @Run44forrest it's prolly for later, Kana is acquired from a quest
[2:06:24] <MaverickJoker> cultist?
[2:06:26] <+jiggy_snipe> creepy creepy
[2:06:29] <%RyuuAoi> Five confirmed cases of Covid-19 in my state. ARE WE WINNING YET?
[2:06:31] <lotharrio> You can always take a bath.
[2:06:31] <KatabolicRage> reason is more sanity than dumbness
[2:06:32] <+lethallunacyx> I mean Canadians do hunt, a LOT.
[2:06:35] <hntronium> Reason isn't smarts
[2:06:39] <+jiggy_snipe> not dumb, less sane
[2:06:46] <hntronium> Knowledge is smarts
[2:06:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> @RyuuAoi cangratulations!
[2:06:52] <MooseoneLivedhere> canadian here i love guns
[2:06:53] <GandhiTheTerrible> you're not more dumber, you're more insane
[2:06:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That is the best thing you could have gotten from running out of money
[2:07:07] <sexdrugsvideogames> guns are kinda cool tho
[2:07:10] <Alias_McDoe> you can buy melee weapons on the seaside
[2:07:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> not gonna lie
[2:07:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> learning is happening
[2:07:24] <Midnight188> yellow sign on the poster there
[2:07:24] <MaverickJoker> bad deviantart
[2:07:25] <+Mendin> There's just the yellow sign
[2:07:25] <%RyuuAoi> @sexdrugsvideogames ! Zombie Apocalypse At Risk !
[2:07:29] <Dhurkst> @lethallunacyx fair enough, but gun-loving isn't part of the culture
[2:07:30] <blackkanye> inflation Kappa
[2:07:35] <%Run44forrest> @manfreda no im wondering if you can get kana outside of the eel quest
[2:07:35] <+jiggy_snipe> oops all furry
[2:07:37] <hntronium> Not dumber
[2:07:38] <+Deosier> they hitted ya with the dickbutts

[2:07:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not dumbness, SANITY
[2:07:44] <ManfredA> yeah no
[2:07:44] <MooseoneLivedhere> hentia
[2:07:50] <TDAWS_MP132> good learning so far
[2:07:53] <ManfredA> it'd break the quest
[2:07:54] <lotharrio> For a first "real" playthrough, messing around and familiarizing yourself with the basic game, expecting to die, is a good idea.
[2:07:54] <GarbageNirvana> Basically zero reason = Maximilian Roivas from Eternal Darkness
[2:07:59] <Crombells> you'd be dumber if your knowledge decreased
[2:07:59] <hntronium> Ikki Tousen was fun though
[2:07:59] <%DensityD> ok boomer weeb
[2:07:59] <YakumoYomi> Ikkitousen was alright.
[2:08:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hardware store has weapons
[2:08:11] <lotharrio> Also, Woolie, you know about the comicbook DIESEL, right? The American JoJo-knockoff?
[2:08:11] <%SpaghettiTime44> Not dumb, crazy
[2:08:13] <sexdrugsvideogames> its a lovecraft game, so you go insane
[2:08:15] <MaverickJoker> weapon store?
[2:08:17] <alephalpha> carpenter hammer even while enrfed is the shit
[2:08:17] <Alias_McDoe> you can buy with that
[2:08:18] <MaverickJoker> GUNS?!
[2:08:18] <+lethallunacyx> @Dhurkst True, we love are guns to a ridiculous degree
[2:08:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hammer god to death
[2:08:25] <+lethallunacyx> our*
[2:08:27] <anar_bael> hardware store = melee weapons
[2:08:32] <Alias_McDoe> it's enough money
[2:08:34] <NeroInfinite> HArdware store is mostly strength weapons
[2:08:35] <MaxXtreme23> carpenter hammer SO GOOD
[2:08:37] <alephalpha> carpenter hamme ris the most reliable weapon
[2:08:39] <MaverickJoker> aw

[2:09:16] <@Solidus_113> What does the old god want
[2:09:16] <wrydiculous> roll that dice baby
[2:09:18] <ManfredA> it's a CHA check prolly
[2:09:19] <lotharrio> @Run44forrest A single issue was made that was just the Geb fight.
[2:09:20] <anar_bael> STEAL THE KNIFE TO USE DEX WEAPON
[2:09:21] <MaxXtreme23> i mean I got the game yesterday, so I don't have much perception of what it's like nerfed or not

[2:09:30] <MaverickJoker> GREAT SUCCESS
[2:09:33] <Dhurkst> whoopsie-doodle
[2:09:34] <reonome> welp
[2:09:36] <wrydiculous> Has knife but jumps
[2:09:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> At least the ocean has been fed :)
[2:09:36] <anar_bael> rip
[2:09:38] <spardanwarrior> DO A FLIP
[2:09:38] <hntronium> She gonna go crazy
[2:09:40] <+SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:09:42] <xeros720> farewell reason
[2:09:42] <+jiggy_snipe> wait why have a knife if you're gonna jump?
[2:09:43] <%DensityD> but my charisma ring
[2:09:43] <hntronium> At this rate
[2:09:47] <Dhurkst> LUL
[2:09:48] <+lethallunacyx> She said foh loser
[2:09:49] <GandhiTheTerrible> 10 Reason already monkaS
[2:09:52] <sexdrugsvideogames> schoolgirls with spears?
[2:09:55] <hntronium> Too coward to use knife
[2:09:56] <%DensityD> do a flip
[2:10:00] <MaverickJoker> better than getting stabbed on fail
[2:10:01] <Crombells> because they don't want people to stop them
[2:10:02] <NeroInfinite> Do a flip
[2:10:03] <anar_bael> We ain't allies with people we stabbing or bashing like the best
[2:10:05] <qwesta6> why not both
[2:10:06] <GarbageNirvana> Plan B?
[2:10:10] <MooseoneLivedhere> bakemonogatari vibes
[2:10:10] <RyanTheRecluse> maybe wanted to die instead of jumping to old god
[2:10:10] <MaxXtreme23> also, have y'all ever hit 0 stamina but managed to bounce back thanks to the absorb spell
[2:10:11] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus can't let anyone stop you Woolie
[2:10:12] <Renkage> The way I see it. Is you try to convince them. They say "GET BACK!" Or some shit. She panics, she falls off
[2:10:14] <karismaticprik> The knife is for air combo
[2:10:16] <osiris1260> Success means she gives you the knife
[2:10:16] <Dhurkst> STAB THE OCEAN
[2:10:17] <Prevot> always double tap
[2:10:17] <wrydiculous> she had step 1a but decided to go step 2a then 2b
[2:10:18] <+CSNG> Low charisma: “do a flip!”
[2:10:20] <+teg88> Stab the ocean
[2:10:21] <Dr_Mooose> making sure you don't fail
[2:10:23] <+jiggy_snipe> super suicide
[2:10:26] <lotharrio> Juggle self in air with chest knifing.
[2:10:32] <splatty1> redundancy is important Kappa
[2:10:34] <Renkage> While just letting her do it, will have her stab herself
[2:10:34] <hntronium> @MaxXtreme23 I was at -1 before I used a sewing kit to not die
[2:10:35] <+lethallunacyx> Use the floor to auto stab yourself maybe
[2:10:37] <+mczarklesby> Knife is just a cut so the sharks find you.
[2:10:38] <laguerrilha> @sexdrugsvideogames search Ikki Tousen Kanu instead, she is the onlyone that matters in that
[2:10:45] <ZeeJiggle> Just one more to add to the list of "Corpse (Nothing)"
[2:10:45] <RyanTheRecluse> that one cool death stranding moment in the trailer when the gun didn't work
[2:10:51] <TDAWS_MP132> best avoid that for now
[2:10:58] <MooseoneLivedhere> wow
[2:11:01] <MaverickJoker> nice bath
[2:11:04] <MaverickJoker> sounds good
[2:11:05] <TDAWS_MP132> in the mansion?

[2:11:25] <%optimasmaximas> VoteNay
[2:11:34] <MooseoneLivedhere> BibleThump
[2:11:37] <coracor> if only it were that easy
[2:11:40] <hntronium> What a waste
[2:11:42] <MaxXtreme23> Does it game over if Doom hits 100%?
[2:11:47] <MooseoneLivedhere> end
[2:11:48] <TDAWS_MP132> check the schoolyard or library?
[2:11:50] <nothuzad> yes MaxXtreme23
[2:11:51] <Doodle_Taco> @maxxtreme23 yes
[2:11:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[2:12:03] <rubbishbinge> Game over at 100%, gotta do all 5 mysteries in that 100
[2:12:06] <%DensityD> FeelsBadMan you will never have a nine tailed kitsune girl draw a bath for you FeelsBadMan
[2:12:07] <BoneofMalkav> Yes, Game Over once Doom hit 100%
[2:12:07] <Crombells> wasted stamina regen, unfortunately
[2:12:09] <Dhurkst> little Metal Gears <3
[2:12:10] <Dr_Mooose> metal gear
[2:12:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Is that a Metal Gear?!
[2:12:11] <MaxXtreme23> damn, i got mad lucky then, I beat my first run with 94% doom lol
[2:12:21] <MooseoneLivedhere> oh to a teen age japaness girl
[2:12:21] <xeros720> sick tapedeck
[2:12:22] <BoneofMalkav> That is indeed a Metal Gear
[2:12:23] <sexdrugsvideogames> @laguerrilha awesome design
[2:12:31] <%bread_assassin> That was 5, though.
[2:12:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's a good trade all things considered
[2:12:32] <lotharrio> She's not gonna beat the game the first time. Familiarizing herself with it makes the most sense.
[2:12:36] <anar_bael> There's free money in the robot at home infront of the mirror
[2:12:36] <laguerrilha> shame its on an awful anime
[2:12:36] <MassConnect> are they sure it's not a mirror? poster seems unlikely
[2:12:37] <+Mendin> So you turned down the hot bath and used that doom saving to take a nice shower and chill time
[2:12:59] <Teh_Un> This is gonna end with 100% Doom at this rate

[2:20:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> BIG WRONG
[2:20:30] <+Orenjevel> Keikaku Means Spirals
[2:20:34] <lotharrio> Now THAT'S a good one.
[2:20:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's bullshit, but I believe it
[2:20:35] <laguerrilha> "Its not called a 'sword', its a KATANA"-weeb
[2:20:36] <hntronium> WOAH
[2:20:38] <Alias_McDoe> AKCHUALY!!!
[2:20:40] <hntronium> That's a good one
[2:20:40] <wrydiculous> holy shit thats good
[2:20:42] <+jiggy_snipe> does Fujiko mean something?
[2:20:45] <damienlunas> Fujiko Chiharu
[2:20:45] <KatabolicRage> also pretty lucky, allies can be useless to the point of reducing your stats
[2:20:46] <+Mendin> You've gotten two +stat followers, good shit

[2:20:51] <%DensityD> woolieS woolieT
[2:20:51] <Dr_Mooose> they're all related

[2:20:52] <wrydiculous> bugged name
[2:20:52] <%DensityD> woolieF woolieU
[2:20:56] <GandhiTheTerrible> allies are items
[2:21:00] <MooseoneLivedhere> yep
[2:21:02] <Alias_McDoe> they just give buffs
[2:21:05] <+Orenjevel> STUDENT E is best girl
[2:21:05] <hntronium> They are in fact items
[2:21:09] <spardanwarrior> Everyone
[2:21:10] <lotharrio> They're just stat buffs. Even the properly named ones.
[2:21:14] <%Run44forrest> @woolieversus they are consumables
[2:21:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Some allies are unique, but the schoolyard ones aren't
[2:21:16] <Midnight188> Magic Time?
[2:21:16] <anar_bael> Yeah allies are just items really
[2:21:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> time to dilly sally elsewhere
[2:21:37] <Alias_McDoe> some of the unique allies can intervene in certain events though
[2:21:42] <MaverickJoker> spells? PogChamp
[2:21:44] <%DensityD> cram school
[2:21:44] <anar_bael> magic at this point is just as viable as melee cause equal stats
[2:21:45] <MooseoneLivedhere> games needs more gyaru girls
[2:21:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> That seems very not worth it
[2:21:52] <%Run44forrest> friends are just consumables
[2:21:59] <arkv01> dilly dally jelly belly
[2:21:59] <spardanwarrior> Everyone's favorite character from the Village Hidden in the Leaves, Fishcake Spiral.

[2:22:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You joke, but...
[2:22:19] <lotharrio> @MooseoneLivedhere I think the timeframe is before gyaru trend. But you could get cool street gang girls.

[2:22:50] <arkv01> berry cute neko
[2:22:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> That was the first spell
[2:22:56] <wrydiculous> god lets not katakana lovecraft's cat's name
[2:22:59] <MaverickJoker> expel evil
[2:22:59] <42nfl19> "RETURN THE SLAB"
[2:23:00] <NeroInfinite> expel is good
[2:23:01] <MaverickJoker> nice
[2:23:03] <hntronium> Absorb is pretty good
[2:23:09] <MooseoneLivedhere> it was his dead dads cat
[2:23:15] <Doodle_Taco> @wrydiculous Garufierdu
[2:23:16] <MaverickJoker> reason was mana
[2:23:18] <damienlunas> ◯ガーマン。。。
[2:23:20] <MaverickJoker> now i remember
[2:23:22] <%DensityD> anyone else looking forward to Nicholas Cage in the "Color from Outer Space" movie? KappaRoss
[2:23:22] <coracor> rabukurafuto
[2:23:24] <MaverickJoker> reason = mana
[2:23:27] <xeros720> ouch, high reason costs
[2:23:30] <anar_bael> Oh that doesn't sound great
[2:23:32] <+lethallunacyx> Spells are rough
[2:23:35] <+Mendin> That movie's already out and it's also Really Good apparently
[2:23:38] <hntronium> Thats good
[2:23:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Prevot i guess hp's reason was -100
[2:23:39] <tattleworm> use it imo
[2:23:40] <MooseoneLivedhere> DensityD: yes
[2:23:42] <+Mendin> you're at max stamina and it takes out a chunk of doom
[2:23:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's a desperate onwe
[2:23:43] <anar_bael> Oh thats nice
[2:23:44] <NeroInfinite> I'd use that
[2:23:44] <TDAWS_MP132> good for emergencies
[2:23:44] <Alias_McDoe> good one
[2:23:46] <+Mendin> That sounds like a windmill slam
[2:23:47] <xeros720> hmm, expel evil seems good
[2:23:49] <Doodle_Taco> Expel evil can be actually useful
[2:23:50] <42nfl19> Whats the FND stat?
[2:23:51] <+Orenjevel> Expel Evil is basically free!
[2:23:55] <+Mendin> Funds
[2:23:55] <hntronium> @DensityD Its out, and I hear its good
[2:23:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> that is very inefficent
[2:23:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @42nfl19 Funds
[2:24:00] <wrydiculous> expel evil is good now actually
[2:24:07] <+McSnazzyPants> expel evil and regen was the og infinite combo
[2:24:08] <Alias_McDoe> careful with that doom
[2:24:17] <+jiggy_snipe> 100%
[2:24:17] <GandhiTheTerrible> spells are eldrich, almost all of them have a heavy cost
[2:24:18] <MaverickJoker> you just gain exp
[2:24:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> 100%
[2:24:20] <MaxXtreme23> 30% doom at mystery 1 lol
[2:24:20] <MaverickJoker> also doom is 100
[2:24:21] <MooseoneLivedhere> more doom for the game
[2:24:22] <Dr_Mooose> 100%
[2:24:23] <TDAWS_MP132> you're learning!!! Do whatever!
[2:24:24] <wrydiculous> 100% is game over
[2:24:26] <coracor> yeah your doom is kind of balling out of control
[2:24:26] <KatabolicRage> 100%, and it rarely goes down
[2:24:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If Doom go up, Reality go down
[2:24:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Game over at 100%
[2:24:28] <+MisoPhat_> 100% is game over
[2:24:28] <@Solidus_113> Doom is basically a clock
[2:24:30] <GandhiTheTerrible> 100% = game over
[2:24:33] <MaverickJoker> but let me phrase this right: doom endings are AMAZING
[2:24:35] <hntronium> @WoolieVersus Around 15% per mystery is decent
[2:24:35] <Clyderso> If you get enough doom, SAM BRIDGES gets into smash
[2:24:38] <Alias_McDoe> think that you need to do 5 cases without reaching 100%
[2:24:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> funny how theres actually a meta for this 8bit style game
[2:24:41] <rubbishbinge> 100% is game over, need to finish all 5 mysteries before you hit 100
[2:24:45] <wrydiculous> yea doom endings are sick
[2:24:50] <+Mendin> Each mystery and some random events lower doom
[2:24:51] <MooseoneLivedhere> its call Hametsu not doom
[2:24:57] <anar_bael> when health and reason reach 0 its game over, if doom gets to 100 its game over
[2:25:04] <KatabolicRage> exp is far far better then fnd
[2:25:09] <@Solidus_113> you want levels though
[2:25:09] <TDAWS_MP132> it did!
[2:25:09] <Doodle_Taco> Honestly is not worth it
[2:25:10] <xeros720> this is essentially a boardgame/ card game
[2:25:11] <KatabolicRage> you lose that 30 I beleive
[2:25:11] <lotharrio> Yeah but level up though.
[2:25:14] <hntronium> 30 xp to money is a waste tbh
[2:25:18] <MaxXtreme23> you really want levels
[2:25:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You want to level up tho
[2:25:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE
[2:25:28] <+jiggy_snipe> exchange rates Kappa
[2:25:30] <+lethallunacyx> yeah that's not worth it
[2:25:31] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames Visual style & complexity are totally separate
[2:25:32] <NeroInfinite> 30% doom and they haven't done anything
[2:25:35] <Renkage> Because video games
[2:25:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sell your memories for cold hard cash
[2:25:40] <+Orenjevel> Only by suffering silently do we grow?
[2:25:44] <anar_bael> its trading exp for money

[2:28:47] <Alias_McDoe> no, it works for some events
[2:28:49] <ShiningAxis> flashlight is a lightsource that is used in many events
[2:28:50] <wrydiculous> but it is a very good item
[2:28:53] <ShiningAxis> really good item
[2:28:56] <BoneofMalkav> Bork Bork
[2:28:59] <warmnoid> flashlight has the most utility
[2:29:00] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames The visual style is just a reference to an older style of game. The updates aren't a design decision so much as simply being part of modern game development.
[2:29:00] <Dr_Mooose> hammer time

[3:03:55] <+paladinstarbuster> STUPID
[3:03:57] <MyNameIsRasus> GAME OVER
[3:03:58] <%Klonoa__> ended combat with 0 reason, rip
[3:03:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Reason too low, like we said
[3:03:58] <Teh_Un> F
[3:03:58] <powerprotoman> game over yeaaaah
[3:04:00] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[3:04:01] <%bread_assassin> Ya fucked up, Woolie.
[3:04:07] <MaxXtreme23> Should've meditated then hit im
[3:04:08] <+Freeborg1997> When's KOTOR 2?
[3:04:08] <+jiggy_snipe> you ended with 0 reason
[3:04:08] <coracor> you could have meditated and then smacked it and been fine
[3:04:09] <Sundaysmiles01> Sounds like a Greenday song
[3:04:12] <warmnoid> How fitting
[3:04:12] <sexdrugsvideogames> cool ending tho
[3:04:13] <KatabolicRage> it was a tough fight for being as low as she was
[3:04:14] <TopTierHarley> dekillASoul
[3:04:14] <%allups> u got cut up
[3:04:16] <Prevot> it's your fault again, Woolie
[3:04:16] <powerprotoman> woolie killing his wife Twice
[3:04:17] <@Solidus_113> And that's World of Horror
[3:04:17] <+RealThiele> BIG dooms
[3:04:21] <Sundaysmiles01> Ending Achieved!
[3:04:21] <MyNameIsRasus> GOT SOME GOOD HITS IN
[3:04:23] <+lethallunacyx> I think I went -30 once
[3:04:24] <C24U> @WoolieVersus You cant end combat with 0. You have to have at least 1 before it ends or you die
[3:04:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> At the cost of plot resolution
[3:04:31] <wrydiculous> woolie if the fight ENDS with 0 reason, it's a confirm game over
[3:04:34] <MaxXtreme23> If it's any consolation, your doom was at 50% at mystery 1, so the run was fucked anyway lol
[3:04:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....maybe if you meditated
[3:04:36] <RyanTheRecluse> so achievements unlock more items/events
[3:04:40] <Renkage> You had a lot of ways out of that. But your still new, so it's understandable
[3:04:41] <+BigBruthaThunda> meditation too risky
[3:04:44] <TopTierHarley> true Max
[3:04:44] <+paladinstarbuster> IF YOU HAD MEDITATED
[3:04:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Shoul've meditated prepped strong
[3:04:47] <weirdducks> was gonna lose anyways doom was too high
[3:04:49] <TDAWS_MP132> you can look at the full log in the menu
[3:04:50] <%Klonoa__> should have meditated and then killed it yeah
[3:04:51] <KatabolicRage> but hey you can try a custom run this time maybe? where you actually select your character n stuff
[3:04:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> too risky when you were going to win
[3:04:57] <+McSnazzyPants> meditate would've saved you
[3:05:00] <Prevot> that log thing is way too confusing
[3:05:02] <Sundaysmiles01> Instead of caps, we'll trade TP
[3:05:03] <BoneofMalkav> Achievements also unlock more items and even playable characters and allies too
[3:05:04] <Rhinoprotoss> [warning]
[3:05:04] <Renkage> Coulda meditated. Coulda also did the desperate struggle and did 20 damage
[3:05:08] <lotharrio> Mostly just accept that you're gonna lose a lot early on. Like most roguelikes.
[3:05:09] <MaxXtreme23> @BigBruthaThunda at the last turn, meditation wasn't risky because he could've still killed it with a prep and strong attack
[3:05:14] <Nekros4442> Death's Door Woolie

[3:05:24] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 21 minutes
[3:05:24] <C24U> It's a chance to recover
[3:05:24] <+McSnazzyPants> in the you menu there's a full log button
[3:05:25] <MyNameIsRasus> It was reason
[3:05:26] <+BigBruthaThunda> I was being sarcastic
[3:05:29] <Dr_Mooose> get one last shot
[3:05:29] <%Run44forrest> UNO MAS
[3:05:31] <KatabolicRage> if you can fenangle it or maybe use an item you can pull yourself out of it
[3:05:32] <Doodle_Taco> Death's Door
[3:05:33] <+Alicitzen> Its so you can recover, battle doesnt end even if you go to negatives
[3:05:34] <+BigBruthaThunda> obviously need to mediation ffs
[3:05:34] <+RealThiele> haha one more
[3:05:35] <+Orenjevel> Die Hardman

[3:05:46] <+RealThiele> *stares at Flagellant*
[3:05:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's a lot like that
[3:05:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> @BigBruthaThunda Too risky to heal before winning tho
[3:05:54] <mashuubosch> !uptime
[3:05:54] <MaxXtreme23> Death's door isn't one more hit, it's a random chance on if any future hit will kill you
[3:05:54] <+Alicitzen> You can live ages at negatives
[3:05:54] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 21 minutes
[3:05:55] <rubbishbinge> Meditation would've put you at 1 Stamina and 1 Reason
[3:05:55] <RyanTheRecluse> so sometimes you can heal and other times you might get enough xp to level up and heal straight away
[3:06:09] <+BigBruthaThunda> you didn't win
[3:06:13] <Rhinoprotoss> Confusing?
[3:06:15] <+HDmexiqtioner> Spooky
[3:06:15] <Nekros4442> Basically if you could heal to 1 and kill the boss in the same turn you would've lived
[3:06:22] <Renkage> Encounter meant event. I can see why that could be confusing
[3:06:23] <+Alicitzen> next encounter means fight/scene
[3:06:37] <powerprotoman> you didnt beat it
[3:06:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie going 'lalala'
[3:06:39] <+McSnazzyPants> next ENCOUNTER not next TURN
[3:06:45] <TopTierHarley> you didn't beat it
[3:06:45] <KatabolicRage> the important thing is to not be at zero when it ends, you can get super wrecked into negatives
[3:06:45] <keyworthe> you didn't beat shbit
[3:06:48] <%allups> u got an end u beat it
[3:06:49] <+jiggy_snipe> you lost your sanity
[3:06:49] <keyworthe> you just lost
[3:06:50] <lotharrio> Wasn't a proper ending but you did beat the boss.
[3:06:52] <laguerrilha> F
[3:06:55] <keyworthe> you lost my dude
[3:06:58] <@Solidus_113> Now quickly check out the customize options @WoolieVersus
[3:07:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> "You've perished" Woolie: "I did it!"
[3:07:04] <powerprotoman> you gameovered
[3:07:04] <@Solidus_113> custom run*
[3:07:08] <Sundaysmiles01> Junji does need more love after the whole PT debacle
[3:07:14] <weirdducks> there was more you lost the first case
[3:07:21] <sexdrugsvideogames> he doesnt get mad, so he actually lost twice!
[3:07:22] <+lethallunacyx> You got your charcter "beat" to death
[3:07:23] <%Run44forrest> @woolieversus check out 2bit and custom run
[3:07:24] <Sundaysmiles01> that was such a loss for all of us

[3:07:53] <+jiggy_snipe> @sexdrugsvideogames i just got that lol
[3:07:59] <powerprotoman> Woolie "sanity at risk" madden
[3:08:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Keep going
[3:08:15] <sexdrugsvideogames> that car!
[3:08:16] <DedlokPM> DEJA VU
[3:08:18] <KatabolicRage> the goal of the game is to do 5 mysteries without hitting 100 doom or eating shit
[3:08:20] <+SuperKirby24> DEJA VU
[3:08:33] <KatabolicRage> eh, broadly speaking
[3:08:34] <RyanTheRecluse> each run is 5 mysteries from a pool of 12
[3:08:36] <powerprotoman> woolie dying on the tutorial "i won right?"
[3:08:39] <nothuzad> would be cool if you looked at the start up of option 3
[3:08:43] <TopTierHarley> it doesn't count as solved since you game overed
[3:08:50] <Renkage> Hope he continues with this game. He didn't even get close to beating it
[3:09:05] <+HDmexiqtioner> Hello Woolie and Punch Mom
[3:09:05] <+Orenjevel> Darkness! Imprisoning me!
[3:09:15] <sexdrugsvideogames> but they do get an ending number, right?
[3:09:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[3:09:16] <+HDmexiqtioner> You'll enjoy the mystery game announcement
[3:09:22] <rubbishbinge> all 5 mysteries need to be solved in the 100 doom
[3:09:24] <%Run44forrest> @woolieversus custom run PogChamp
[3:09:39] <anar_bael> that was rough but first runs are always rough
[3:09:50] <Timesteel> if you have questions about the game I recommend talking to Pat next time you do the podcast
[3:09:51] <Laironx3> weeb cthulhu
[3:09:52] <Sundaysmiles01> Twas fun to watch, I love me some eldritch horror
[3:09:52] <TopTierHarley> nah my first run was fine lol
[3:09:53] <Prevot> Cthulhu-chan
[3:10:01] <Renkage> Once you understand the game. You can win multiple times in a row
[3:10:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Can't wait for custom campaigns soon
[3:10:15] <Sarl109> @WoolieVersus every new session is made of 5 random cases, you need to solve all 5 before Doom reaches 100
[3:10:18] <%optimasmaximas> does anyone know what "Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045" on netflix mean? new movie?
[3:10:21] <Renkage> Like. The game straight up has a meta.
[3:10:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> yeah, also on stream
[3:10:25] <+jiggy_snipe> it was a learning session
[3:10:30] <+lethallunacyx> It's certainly a learning experience
[3:10:32] <%BinaryFireball> Discover strategize smoke dannk
[3:10:34] <KatabolicRage> if you have time y ou should try doing a custom run
[3:10:37] <nothuzad> just the start of a "real" ru would be nice
[3:10:40] <Sundaysmiles01> I'm game for another run if you are
[3:10:41] <+Alicitzen> If you can understand an eldritch horror then its not really eldritch
[3:10:42] <Rhinoprotoss> With the rate you're going you can start and die just in time
[3:10:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> stand alone complex was a series, right?
[3:10:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @optimasmaximas New movie. And they insist on loli Major
[3:10:49] <keyworthe> why not
[3:10:53] <Prevot> maybe if you take the controls it can go faster
[3:10:55] <presque> I think you sound tired
[3:10:56] <keyworthe> you got stuff going on?
[3:11:03] <pi_in_the_sci> This is why blind playthroughs are good.
[3:11:05] <Timesteel> a full run can be a little long if it’s your first time doing the mysteries
[3:11:13] <arkv01> dw, up to how punchmom feels
[3:11:18] <keyworthe> coroner virus is about, just stay at home my dude and play the video gamus
[3:11:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Th3SmartAlec oh...guess its not a good time to get in to ghost in the shell? LUL
[3:11:26] <+jiggy_snipe> 11pm
[3:11:41] <Sundaysmiles01> hell yeah!
[3:11:42] <+projectmanatees> what if woolie did a run this time
[3:11:44] <Crombells> @WoolieVersus You can settle for one mystery, shouldn't take nearly as long as the first time
[3:11:45] <%optimasmaximas> yeyeye
[3:11:50] <Renkage> Woolie in the driver seat this time? Change things up?
[3:11:52] <Dr_Mooose> speedrun
[3:11:53] <%RioGascar> Could do bumbo
[3:11:56] <%allups> WIN or DIE
[3:11:57] <MaverickJoker> i'd like to see punch mom and woolie get somewhere past tutorial
[3:12:17] <0rond> life is cheap
[3:12:18] <Sundaysmiles01> I love that kirby lamp
[3:12:23] <powerprotoman> woolies got zero survival instinct
[3:12:26] <TopTierHarley> don't explore everything
[3:12:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just don't do World of Snail
[3:12:36] <Timesteel> Ya I didn’t beat it until like my 5th run
[3:12:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @optimasmaximas Just watch the first animated movie and SAC. And that's itm because Arise started the 'but what if she was a little girl tho'
[3:12:40] <+melanthia_> Running is your friend
[3:12:40] <TopTierHarley> no way your Doom was 50+ one mystery 1 lol
[3:12:42] <Dr_Mooose> each run is a learning opportunity
[3:12:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> You can also customize your colors
[3:13:03] <Ne0classical> They had a 50 doom mystery one
[3:13:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> huh
[3:13:11] <weirdducks> each run is 5 mysteries
[3:13:11] <%allups> life is fast and cheap is junji ito world
[3:13:14] <Crombells> running is for cowards that cannot wield a hammer good
[3:13:17] <TopTierHarley> I really can't believe it Neo

[3:30:33] <Ne0classical> Its really not worth it, just do the missions...
[3:30:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, not necessarily worth it. The Doom was really high
[3:30:38] <%bread_assassin> Ya don't want to raise DOOM too much. Wasting 50 doom on the first mystery is a recipe for disaster.
[3:30:58] <Ozavic> They're getting it!
[3:31:07] <%razielhex> Raise all DOOM and unlock DOOMGUY
[3:31:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> uh oh

[3:34:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> what about regular attack?
[3:34:14] <Teh_Un> Scream back at her
[3:34:26] <lotharrio> See what your accuracy on the bottle is. Maybe aim+regular will let you do more damage per turn

[3:35:30] <Prevot> jelly skelly
[3:35:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wait, to be clear, does the character always attack first?
[3:35:41] <+chiazam> There are very few ways to heal in this game
[3:35:43] <Shion963> elongated arms and jellified bones, huh 🤔
[3:35:43] <%Run44forrest> yes
[3:35:44] <lotharrio> The PC always seems to attack first.
[3:35:56] <sexdrugsvideogames> they are at 2hp now...
[3:36:04] <@Solidus_113> you do have higher str
[3:36:09] <%razielhex> It's thje Police Chief from Last Action Hero, or, probably, Japanese Carl WInslowe
[3:36:09] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[3:36:10] <Renkage> And yes. The character can heal by resting in home. Cost doom though. Doom=100% you lose

[3:36:58] <NeroInfinite> Sell the bottle
[3:37:02] <%Run44forrest> rest lets you heal at the cost of doom. theres some items and spells that heal you but they also have their downsides

[3:43:47] <sexdrugsvideogames> the police are part of the cult
[3:43:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Wamp wamp
[3:44:04] <%razielhex> "HEY MAN! I GOT'CHA MAIL!"
[3:44:09] <rubbishbinge> Police force have guns and eldritch horrors are weak to bullet

[3:44:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> [ 👁️ ]
[3:44:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @powerprotoman Woolz might be the essence of learn nothing. He was told "evolve or die" and he decided to die.
[3:44:18] <@Solidus_113> Open up bro i'm a fairy
[3:44:21] <hntronium> there goes your rest

[3:44:57] <%Andrez_> Andrez_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Survivor squad
[3:44:58] <KatabolicRage> resting is extra doomy with this god
[3:45:00] <Sundaysmiles01> its why they're there
[3:45:00] <+jiggy_snipe> remember REST = DOOM
[3:45:07] <yoshkosh20> stickin your head through doggy doors. a power move used by only the best salesmen.
[3:45:12] <NeroInfinite> rest means more doom
[3:45:15] <%Parapattern> I am small and flexible enough to get though the average doggy door
[3:45:17] <%razielhex> @PsychedelicSnake Hold on, let me get my copy of "Angels with Filthy Souls"
[3:45:21] <wrydiculous> ohhh so you say
[3:45:24] <KatabolicRage> you gotta do 5 entire mysteries with your ONE doom bar
[3:45:25] <+jiggy_snipe> 100% DOOM gameover
[3:45:25] <@Solidus_113> Doom is a clock
[3:45:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Goizo "Oh word?"
[3:45:26] <PsychedelicSnake> Eldritch horrors love pantsu
[3:45:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> 100% IS GAME OVER
[3:45:29] <powerprotoman> when it hits 100 you lose
[3:45:30] <+chiazam> Stop
[3:45:32] <cobalt_phoenix_> doom never resets
[3:45:32] <yoshkosh20> @Parapattern get outta here sadako

[3:45:41] <+chiazam> Then you run
[3:45:44] <Dr_Mooose> that's what they all say

[3:45:45] <+jiggy_snipe> you have 5 cases tho :)
[3:45:49] <+vaporousTippler> Have just a little doom, as a treat.
[3:45:51] <%razielhex> She's got GOUT
[3:45:52] <C24U> You are at 28% with no finished investigations
[3:45:54] <PsychedelicSnake> Pale yellow is hot
[3:45:55] <nothuzad> doom doesnt reset - the meter counts for ALL 5 cases + end
[3:45:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOUR BUDGET IS UNDER 20 PER MYSTERY
[3:45:59] <%bread_assassin> You gotta make 100 doom last 5 mysteries.
[3:46:00] <NeroInfinite> woolie there are five cases
[3:46:00] <+jiggy_snipe> pale yellow huh
[3:46:00] <%razielhex> GOUT.. GO UP
[3:46:07] <hntronium> last time you were hitting 40% before the first mystery was even over, you were going to fail that run
[3:46:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie: "5 x 50% < 100%"
[3:46:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> he doesnt hear you guys
[3:46:10] <PsychedelicSnake> Bitchass ghost painting
[3:46:11] <Sundaysmiles01> delicious XP
[3:46:22] <lotharrio> XP=100 seems to be a level.

[3:46:34] <damienlunas> how come I can't see their doom percentage
[3:46:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sexdrugsvideogames Like Paige, he rejects the concept of information.
[3:46:44] <sexdrugsvideogames> its like shouting at a character in a horror movie in the cinema

[3:48:18] <PsychedelicSnake> OPPAI

[3:49:31] <+PapaGravestone> tobiasWUT
[3:49:39] <damienlunas> Rainbow Mountain Blend is the best flavor of boss coffee full stop.
[3:49:42] <lotharrio> Pursue mystery.
[3:49:44] <hntronium> how long till they rest again
[3:49:46] <%Run44forrest> mm blood
[3:49:48] <hntronium> oh wait never mind
[3:49:50] <Blastotron> But was it refreshing blood at least?
[3:49:52] <$NoWayRyanTatum> what happened to your EYES??

[3:50:09] <KatabolicRage> 42% at mystery 1 out of 5, oof
[3:50:12] <+SuperKirby24> how much doom are they at Kappa
[3:50:13] <Ner234> LUL Oh boy
[3:50:13] <Turning2Dust> We out here, chillin' at home, lettin' the world end, like real heroes
[3:50:14] <Renkage> If they somehow win with 40+ doom...
[3:50:14] <+jiggy_snipe> I doubt the PC is sleeping cuz of low Reason
[3:50:15] <rubbishbinge> its not a little bit of doom ;-;
[3:50:15] <hntronium> what a waste of staina
[3:50:18] <+FrenchTact1cs> $2 allready, lort
[3:50:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> @damienlunas is that a reference to blue mountain coffee?
[3:50:21] <Ner234> YES
[3:50:25] <hntronium> Yes
[3:50:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YES
[3:50:27] <+paladinstarbuster> YES
[3:50:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[3:50:29] <+SuperKirby24> YES
[3:50:30] <BestTeaMaker> yes
[3:50:30] <+chiazam> Woolie dont lie to her like that
[3:50:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You become Rip and Tear
[3:50:32] <ComfyFox> there's a character later, that profits from DOOM
[3:50:34] <wrydiculous> I wanna see the reaction when they learn that doom lasts for the whole 5 cases
[3:50:34] <KatabolicRage> the problem is your doom does not go down between mysteries
[3:50:34] <C24U> The final event giveS TONS of Doom back to back
[3:50:37] <@Solidus_113> Almost everything you do makes doom go up
[3:50:41] <+paladinstarbuster> YOU HAVE 5 QUESTS
[3:50:43] <damienlunas> I think it's unrelated
[3:50:47] <BestTeaMaker> doom is your timer
[3:50:51] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Let's pick the god that gets super-powered when we rest... Now let's rest all the time."
[3:50:51] <Iam_Dead> you have to go through 5 mysteries
[3:50:52] <+jiggy_snipe> your DOOM increases as you go through the game
[3:50:52] <Turning2Dust> The Old god influences the town at different doom thresholds.
[3:50:54] <BestTeaMaker> to finish all 5
[3:50:54] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus It will increase the difficulty, and you can't complete the game with doom too high. Gotta do 5 mysteries.
[3:50:57] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[3:50:58] <powerprotoman> woolie you need to do 5 of these cases with the same doom meter
[3:50:59] <+SuperKirby24> DOOM CARRIES OVER BETWEEN CASES
[3:51:04] <+chiazam> Doom climbs every time you investigate Woolie
[3:51:07] <+FrenchTact1cs> dude is taking Ls left and right
[3:51:10] <cobalt_phoenix_> doom doesnt reset, it rarely goes down, everythung
[3:51:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Big brain strats
[3:51:20] <cobalt_phoenix_> everything makes it go up
[3:51:21] <%Run44forrest> @woolieversus every event is 1% doom on top of whatever happens
[3:51:31] <hntronium> 1/5
[3:51:33] <Sundaysmiles01> kek
[3:51:35] <NeroInfinite> Yep
[3:51:36] <damienlunas> INFORMATION GATHERING

[3:52:04] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:52:04] <C24U> Less than 20% per case because you need some to spare for final case
[3:52:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Here's how you avoid doom: don't explore all over
[3:52:07] <Renkage> Uhh
[3:52:08] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[3:52:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You get a little back when you complete a mystery, but ya gotta be prudent
[3:52:13] <+FrenchTact1cs> D.O.O.M.
[3:52:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> taste the doom
[3:52:15] <%Run44forrest> NotLikeThis
[3:52:17] <+SuperKirby24> Accept death and doom up then LUL
[3:52:24] <Renkage> Fair enough
[3:52:24] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie loves the DOOM

[4:03:39] <Sundaysmiles01> but thats fun
[4:03:40] <powerprotoman> Devoured by Goizo
[4:03:48] <$TIME_PUNCHER> bad end
[4:03:58] <lotharrio> The twist will always be: You earned time. But that's it.
[4:03:59] <Shion963> gotta cover all your eyes like the Sandra Bullock movie
[4:04:00] <cobalt_phoenix_> even drinking the water in a cup
[4:04:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Milk saves
[4:04:11] <Dr_Mooose> only dark color drinks
[4:04:14] <Blastotron> Goizo grabbed me through my piss
[4:04:17] <Teh_Un> Bird Box
[4:04:19] <sexdrugsvideogames> but if nobody can see the reflection, does it really exist?
[4:04:20] <Ner234> GOIZO defeated Milk saves all
[4:04:20] <wrydiculous> fun fact, one encounter involves a person who gouged her eyes out if you are playing goizo
[4:04:20] <reonome> BIRDBOX
[4:04:21] <+jiggy_snipe> i think you have see the reflection so be blind i guess
[4:04:21] <Sundaysmiles01> Blind Sage Cows

[4:04:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bird Box Over Heaven
[4:04:26] <damienlunas> Blind the cows
[4:04:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just blind the cowas
[4:04:32] <+BionoidLCR> you could just put liquid in a coverd cup lol
[4:04:32] <$TIME_PUNCHER> strongest bones EVER
[4:04:32] <MKII> we put activated charcoal in all of our water now
[4:04:37] <+BionoidLCR> thats less complicated lol
[4:04:48] <YakumoYomi> Punch Mom did great. Big proud.
[4:04:50] <Dhurkst> spoopy
[4:04:55] <ShinChris> dangit, did you guys just finish?
[4:04:58] <hntronium> I can see the reflection
[4:04:59] <lotharrio> Punch Mom got freaked out at the start.
[4:04:59] <Sundaysmiles01> Happy St. Pats Day btw
[4:04:59] <wrydiculous> no scary is when you see something truly evil
[4:05:03] <sexdrugsvideogames> great stream
[4:05:04] <+jiggy_snipe> there's more freaky stuff
[4:05:08] <ShinChris> i just came from paige's stream and they were fucking finishing
[4:05:11] <Shion963> it's just based on horror stories
[4:05:13] <@Solidus_113> What could be in that lighthouse
[4:05:20] <+LunarDensetsu> The game in the window
[4:05:30] <hntronium> GOIZO IS REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW
[4:05:35] <+Matto424> some runs are super close it's great
[4:05:41] <lotharrio> Junji Ito isn't really that scary. He's just weird and gross most of the time.
[4:05:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[4:05:41] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 21 minutes
[4:05:53] <%RyuuAoi> Holy Fuck! Is Punch Mom full time Zaibatsu now!?
[4:05:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:06:01] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:06:08] <Shion963> completing quests reduces doom like 30%
[4:06:09] <@Solidus_113> costumes, weapons, gear
[4:06:11] <Dhurkst> @lotharrio a lot of people would disagree
[4:06:13] <+LunarDensetsu> !motivated
[4:06:13] <@Moobot> 722 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:06:21] <+LunarDensetsu> Sad now
[4:06:24] <Sundaysmiles01> its an RP experience
[4:06:45] <Shion963> but sometimes you get lucky perfect runs
[4:06:46] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie PLAY TETRIS 99!
[4:07:00] <+paladinstarbuster> sbfpGou sbfpUno sbfpGi
[4:07:03] <YakumoYomi> Woolie and Punch Mom: After Hours
[4:07:08] <lotharrio> @Dhurkst I mean... I find that uhh... "Creepy Feeling" manga way scarier. Gimme a bit, I'll get the proper name.
[4:07:21] <+JohnMarkley> hello everyone :) /
[4:07:26] <hntronium> I can't believe how luck Pat and Paige were in their first few runs
[4:07:31] <hntronium> FUCK THEY WERE LUCKY
[4:07:58] <YakumoYomi> Yeah, they got the Yamato and wrecked shop
[4:08:01] <+SuperKirby24> So is rng normally fucked on world of horror
[4:08:05] <%razielhex> Pat got a Katana and attacked 4x per round
[4:08:08] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[4:08:26] <wrydiculous> They literally judgement cut their way to victory
[4:08:40] <hntronium> Dex God Swim Captain is great
[4:08:50] <Shion963> absolute luck can happen
[4:08:51] <TalisKanju> End of stream?
[4:08:59] <Sundaysmiles01> Will you get ambitious for a full 1 to 100 percent run?
[4:09:06] <ComfyFox> MOOD
[4:09:23] <%RyuuAoi> Whens Mahvel with Punch Mom? Now?!
[4:09:37] <%DensityD> woolieWHENS
[4:09:39] <lotharrio> @Dhurkst The series I'm thinking of is called Fuan no Tane. I find it much scarier than anything Ito has done.
[4:09:55] <%razielhex> dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r
[4:09:57] <@Solidus_113> But the scissor girl
[4:10:01] <%razielhex> arms get longer
[4:10:05] <YakumoYomi> Punch Mom vs Dreamland, let's go!
[4:10:06] <Shion963> there are ghosts that you can't hit with attacks
[4:10:09] <DedlokPM> #HaveAGhostHauntWoolieForNoMoreThanFourMonths
[4:10:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dammit Woolie again with no selling ghosts
[4:10:18] <wrydiculous> Fuan no tane creeps me out more than junji ito tbh
[4:10:18] <%razielhex> BNG
[4:10:19] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Dhurkst
[4:10:33] <YakumoYomi> @DedlokPM Nice throwback
[4:10:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Fuan no Tane and PTSD Radio is great
[4:10:38] <+EldritchBee> worst part abt no more shitstorms is the lack of woolies yearly haunting
[4:10:39] <Sundaysmiles01> MAXIMUM MAILBOX BULGE
[4:10:58] <Dhurkst> @lotharrio if you dont get Ito, check out 15:38 / 22:52 How Media Scares Us: The Work of Junji Ito by Super Eyepatch Wolf
[4:11:06] <Shion963> fuan no tane yo
[4:11:13] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie Vs. Punch Mo Vs. SMASH LEGGO
[4:11:26] <Dhurkst> @lotharrio ignore timestamp, just a copypaste error
[4:11:26] <lotharrio> Eh. I've read a lot of Ito. I think Fuan no Tane is like... a dozen times better.
[4:11:34] <lotharrio> Gotcha-gotcha.
[4:11:37] <%razielhex> @EldritchBee FOR THE SIN... of PREMARITAL SEX
[4:11:41] <powerprotoman> looking forward to punchmoms full lp of animal crossing new horizons

[4:12:47] <aidoru_jam> LUL
[4:12:53] <lotharrio> The Fuan no Tane guy is apparently always afraid. So it translates well, since like... 1/5 of his stories will trigger something in you.
[4:13:00] <+SuperKirby24> damn brian with these hard reads

[4:13:29] <Dhurkst> @lotharrio Okay, but you're really coming off as contrarian is all. Just because you like something else better, that doesn't mean ito isn't good.
[4:13:31] <%razielhex> Someone else plays, but ADP's and edits your voice to make commentary on it.
[4:13:32] <Shion963> and the game is ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR PC
