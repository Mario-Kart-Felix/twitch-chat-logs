[0:32:36] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Batman is actually responsible for many deaths by letting Joker live

[0:36:38] <bbomi1995> sounds fine to me
[0:36:39] <%Gogogolem> can't argue with results
[0:36:39] <akman14> Kind of counter intuitive
[0:36:39] <%Laecerelius> Can't get infected if they're all dead!

[0:36:39] <SkyPirateArcane> YES PAT

[0:36:40] <+XxBTExX> Seems like a good way to deal with the plague.

[0:36:45] <%Ynkubus18> Turbo evil
[0:36:45] <%TheKillerKalamari> the fact you have to question that
[0:36:45] <Seitine> Maybe.
[0:36:46] <%wsintai> eehehhhh
[0:36:46] <dukenux> Ah... well that's effective?
[0:36:46] <+XxBTExX> I dont know Pat, was Arthas evil?

[0:36:47] <EddieBrock> Evil Effective.
[0:36:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[0:36:49] <Shishi1205> yeah, i mean it doesn't get much more evil
[0:36:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yes, becuase it's based off of fear
[0:36:49] <%sirisvirus> most effeciant way
[0:36:49] <deviate_dv8> You have to ASK?!
[0:36:49] <InkyDraconian> penis
[0:36:50] <%deviljhojho94> i mean
[0:36:50] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Evil but effective
[0:36:50] <%wsintai> I mean
[0:36:50] <%ElenaManetta> You could have just exiled them
[0:36:50] <%sshen> cleansing fire
[0:36:50] <+YabbaTroll> if less people died?
[0:36:50] <+icekept> yes it is
[0:36:51] <OkamiDude15> Very
[0:36:51] <RupanSen> Lawful Evil
[0:36:51] <dukenux> Morally Grey
[0:36:51] <Vikken141> some of them could have survived the disease
[0:36:51] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat Greater good defense, so yes but not immoral
[0:36:52] <BappoSama> Depends on your definition of evil..
[0:36:52] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Depends are yuo a utalitarian?
[0:36:52] <fugnuggets01> probably
[0:36:52] <%connos_livereview> nah its fine
[0:36:53] <Tucker0603> it's evil but wise.
[0:36:53] <+ZoltanBMagnus> yes... UNLESS THE whole family was sick
[0:36:54] <+countgaculatv> Lawful Evil
[0:36:54] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s evil
[0:36:57] <%ElenaManetta> So banish them
[0:36:57] <+van_fair> lawfully evil
[0:36:58] <%Ynkubus18> Poland just washed themsleves
[0:36:58] <$caliginouscalico> Morally ambiguous
[0:36:58] <%Nope80808> LAWFUL EVIL
[0:36:59] <Daxalog> Lawful Evil
[0:37:00] <morthieus> kinda
[0:37:00] <flying_man_3> its the opnly way to be sure
[0:37:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If they're gonna die anyways? Then it's fine
[0:37:04] <cowardlord> BURNED ALIVE PAT
[0:37:04] <dukenux> Lawful Evil.
[0:37:05] <SpaceGuntank> "The ends dont justify the means."
[0:37:05] <+icekept> BURNED ALIVE THOUGH?
[0:37:06] <Caidezes> It's an evil solution.
[0:37:07] <+Nomicro4u> Just dont get plague 4head
[0:37:07] <Xelhesia> quarantine is better
[0:37:08] <%ElenaManetta> Put them on a boat and kick the boat
[0:37:09] <%AncelDeLambert> there's no reason to BURN them
[0:37:09] <BappoSama> Neutral Evil.
[0:37:10] <theobble> if it's not evil then arthas did nothing wrong
[0:37:11] <%TheKillerKalamari> going to go with the chat on Lawful Evil
[0:37:12] <thegrapist__> It's horrible but the intent is to save people so idk if it's evil
[0:37:12] <$cureneckbeard> Leon shoots zombies freely
[0:37:12] <Iwashi94> WITCHES
[0:37:13] <Shishi1205> Dude burning sucks so hard

[0:37:14] <%deviljhojho94> Just dont get sick 4Head
[0:37:14] <@lewdskeletor13> BURNING PEOPLE ALIVE?
[0:37:15] <InsomniacPersona> Very Lawful, Much Evil
[0:37:16] <DrivenDust> since when did it matter to you when something is evil LUL
[0:37:17] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LUL
[0:37:17] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat The plague wasn't a 100% fatal either
[0:37:18] <Unicyclemonkey> it's for the greater good
[0:37:18] <spiderously> it's a lesser evil
[0:37:19] <+XxBTExX> #ArthasdidNothingWRong
[0:37:20] <snake_zen> Yes
[0:37:20] <morthieus> quarantine
[0:37:20] <%VioletHeart> Pff.
[0:37:21] <%sshen> They were bathing in fire
[0:37:22] <%SleepyHero34> Morally grey
[0:37:24] <SparkAfterDark> I'd rather burn
[0:37:24] <%ElenaManetta> A BATH CUREs THE PLAGUE?
[0:37:27] <%connos_livereview> living sucked back then anyways they were probably better off
[0:37:27] <%ItsRatman> BUT THAT DOeSNT WORK
[0:37:29] <Glocktor44> yes it's evil cause the church helped create the conditions that led to the plagues spread
[0:37:30] <dukenux> It's evil cause you didn't have to BURN THEM ALIVE
[0:37:32] <InsomniacPersona> But its airborne
[0:37:33] <Seitine> Cleanse them in fire.
[0:37:33] <+Nomicro4u> but they must be CLEANSED BY FIRE
[0:37:33] <$caliginouscalico> @ynkubus18 part of that was Poland was far enough away from the trade routes that they had advance warning
[0:37:34] <bbomi1995> to starve?
[0:37:36] <fugnuggets01> but what if they were smash players
[0:37:37] <+ZoltanBMagnus> lock them in AND LET THEM STARVE?
[0:37:37] <%Ranryu692> they'd still die of starvation though
[0:37:38] <OkamiDude15> Well alright then
[0:37:38] <shoobieredgrave> @AngriestPat Where'd you get that Geese shirt?
[0:37:39] <TeaJayGee> as a norwegian im stil butthurt about the plague
[0:37:39] <%deviljhojho94> a bath of fire
[0:37:40] <%MightyMaxT> Thanos-level justification
[0:37:40] <malletman241> they did
[0:37:41] <Tampaoster> burn them at the stake
[0:37:41] <Dao_Puppy> Then they throw grandpas body out the window out of spite.
[0:37:42] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat depends if its like for the good of everyone else. unless its a front to kill ppl u dont like
[0:37:43] <%sirisvirus> but they could escape.
[0:37:44] <%crimsonharvest> its not airborne though, its through parasite contact
[0:37:45] <%sshen> Did that dog sitting in the fire saying it's fine have the plague then?
[0:37:45] <Jeemukun> I mean, the whole thing was caused by flea bites
[0:37:45] <rytisone> send them to a 'survivor' island
[0:37:46] <aeonicvector> Bath dosent cure plague, still burn em or accept the loss of life regardless
[0:37:47] <%Ranryu692> that's so much worse than burning them
[0:37:47] <DXLelouch24> so what your saying is to kill the plague we have to get rid of the Smash Community?
[0:37:49] <BappoSama> IF they break out.
[0:37:50] <+theunforgivingsquid> @angriestpat fire is a extra horrible way to die
[0:37:51] <Ion_Laser> gotta cure that with fire
[0:37:51] <BappoSama> Wow
[0:37:51] <OkamiDude15> Starve or burn to death
[0:37:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I mean, people still break quarantine, but punish THAT with death
[0:37:54] <+linSP> FeelsBadMan
[0:37:56] <dukenux> Yeah, just flamenwehr them when they try to get out Kappa
[0:37:57] <rosabellamelantha> wow I'm 33 minutes late and we haven't started yet, nice
[0:37:58] <%ECRead> locking them in... to starve?
[0:38:01] <worldbrand> Eh but the rats still get in and out
[0:38:01] <%whiskey_wolfe_> What if locking them in lets the plague fester and turns them into Tyrants?
[0:38:02] <%sirisvirus> the manpower to guard all sides of the house
[0:38:03] <%Edgy_Macaroon> let them die naturally
[0:38:04] <$Quigsies> boopity boop boop
[0:38:05] <morthieus> hugs for all I have the plague
[0:38:06] <Tucker0603> what?
[0:38:06] <%brickwall35> !uptime
[0:38:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 38m 8s.
[0:38:07] <Shishi1205> yeah what was that
[0:38:10] <Prevot> no wonder he's not writing those books
[0:38:12] <Seitine> I'd argue that fire cleans better than water. Kappa
[0:38:15] <aeonicvector> @DXLelouch24 smash bros confirmed plague carrier
[0:38:15] <Shishi1205> Nibelion said something
[0:38:16] <theobble> local canadian ginger drinks red bull found in couch. descibes flavor as "crispy"
[0:38:17] <InsomniacPersona> NotLikeThis
[0:38:19] <$caliginouscalico> @angriestpat Poland had advanced warning and was away from the trade routes so they had lower mortality rates
[0:38:20] <%Validuntil2077> WHAT
[0:38:23] <$happyface699> FAMOUS internet man
[0:38:24] <%Ynkubus18> @caliginouscalico I was about type that
[0:38:25] <OkamiDude15> Just now
[0:38:26] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Isn't that not confirmed?
[0:38:33] <jimmytwofeet> @AngriestPat Y U SO ANGRY
[0:38:37] <+Jordan_z123> PLEASE BE EXCITED
[0:38:40] <fallenangelzelos> Isn't it already an elmo stream?
[0:38:42] <marvel877> and liam robertson's mad people are only now hearing about the rumors he broke months ago.
[0:38:43] <DXLelouch24> Pat did you see that leak about FF7R?
[0:38:43] <TwinBat> no game, only elmo
[0:38:45] <%Black_Machete> apatLiz
[0:38:45] <Seitine> Elmo needs his own camera.
[0:38:47] <$caliginouscalico> We love Elmo
[0:38:47] <SparkAfterDark> dying in a house fire is actually not that bad a way to go, because it's really more likely that you'll die from lack of oxygen and smoke inhalation, which is scary and unpleasant, but will render you insensate before any of the really bad stuff happens
[0:38:50] <EddieBrock> It was always Elmo's stream.
[0:38:51] <wirblewomble> every stream is an elmo stream
[0:38:57] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fujiwara_92)
[0:38:58] <+JustToWatch> why are we talking about burning people alive
[0:39:00] <%TheStarbecue> WHY doesn't SKELMO ever get to play
[0:39:02] <%This_is_Marco> Its still been years
[0:39:17] <Ion_Laser> GRRM has a lot on his plate
[0:39:19] <+whoami777> @AngriestPat did you see GRRM is working with fromsoftware on a viking game?
[0:39:22] <DXLelouch24> fuck the trees
[0:39:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I think GRRM likes making crappy TV now more than writing good books
[0:39:26] <Ion_Laser> he likes to write a fuck ton
[0:39:29] <%Black_Machete> @justtowatch Paige is here that's why
[0:39:29] <$caliginouscalico> So put less on your plate

It was said in the run-up to Fo76 that it was the first time a AAA dev was making a survival game/basebuildy type thing. But I immediately thought of Metal Gear Survive. Is the difference between first and third great enough in that case to say that Fo76 is/was the first attempt at it?

[2:08:45] <+temporal_zenith> @OkamiDude15 There is a rat that controls a stand
[2:08:48] <+miguelrod777> yes its a rat itself
[2:08:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "Sorry, those roses were optional objectives that I wasn't paying attention to" > bad end
[2:08:50] <KingOfMidgard> As l walk through the valley of the shadow of rats, l take a look at the world and realize we need more cats.

[2:10:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Are we lezzies now?
[2:10:36] <cowardlord> This reminds me of that cage that was put on people's heads with a rat in it
[2:10:40] <axelcezar> a little scissoring for good luck?
[2:10:47] <$SGrim> @KingOfMidgard considering it's 1380, we'll probably find more orphans before we're done.
[2:10:48] <reonome> they're teenagers you sickos
[2:10:48] <Pookiedaexzile> @KingOfMidgard How long would a Barb orphan last....wait Thats how you make a Guts
[2:10:55] <TuxedoNash> probably a french "emily" that'd have sounded too similar to amicia
[2:10:58] <JumboMan214> @AngriestPat I think its short for Amélie
[2:11:00] <Pookiedaexzile> carry on
[2:11:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @reonome yes because that stopped this fandom before

[2:15:04] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat You just needed to stand up to light it
[2:15:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Armored torches! NEW TECH
[2:15:05] <dukenux> that worked
[2:15:06] <$Mendin> Wait you can just chuck an Ether at their face?

[2:15:12] <KingOfMidgard> can you melt the metal torch with acid?
[2:15:12] <Tucker0603> @hentaisenpai9k but instead of fucking everyone he kills em
[2:15:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats bullshit,
[2:15:18] <Dragovus> Stand UP!
[2:15:24] <devanmuse> he's not doing the prompts because COMSUMABLES
[2:15:31] <+miguelrod777> GOBLINS
[2:15:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> He didn't miss it, he just didn't press it cause it's a botched run and he'll miss the item more than his time
[2:15:39] <Pookiedaexzile> So he doesn't see the second fucking light source
[2:15:43] <+SuzakuRising> consumables he can easily make more of
[2:15:43] <Pookiedaexzile> that wasn't there before
[2:15:46] <切捨御免> "huh, who turned this lantern on?"
[2:15:51] <DracaenaLeaf> show that butt

[2:16:00] <Sheepeze> Pat you threw a rock not the extinguishing projectile
[2:16:09] <a_c_chirns> The inquisition and the rats are working together now?
[2:16:13] <DracaenaLeaf> it was the rats
[2:16:22] <Dragovus> Who's rat prints are these?
[2:16:27] <%tyler274> i want ffxiv to let us break bad
[2:16:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I forgot hee changed times, Imma assume I missed a buch of stuff
[2:16:39] <$valriot> This is really good "casual stealth"
[2:16:39] <RupanSen> "must've been a cat"
[2:16:40] <megakruemel> why would he ever think it's not rats
[2:16:59] <+tigerfang86> LOOTING
[2:16:59] <Dr_Mooose> just casually waling in tiny death monsters
[2:17:05] <cowardlord> These guys are brave for walking around with all these rats
[2:17:07] <%This_is_Marco> Theyre rather nonchalant about the MILLIONS of rats by their feet
[2:17:08] <%BestBrosPlay123> imagine a game with the rat tech... but SNAKES!
[2:17:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> don't perv on rat girl, chat. she's like 15.

[2:17:25] <dukenux> WHO'S SQUEAKING
[2:17:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> FRONCH RUCKUS
[2:17:40] <+Zaramoth> shes like 15 in a time period where that was fair game tho
[2:17:45] <+temporal_zenith> What is a corrupt official's favorite instrument? A Lute!
[2:17:49] <rytisone> living on the edge
[2:17:55] <+azure22900> To be fair, fire is stupidly effective at keeping the rats away
[2:17:56] <Tucker0603> the fact that the rats burst into flames shows how fucked up they are
[2:17:57] <frigglefroogle> wtf

[2:59:31] <%Remery_> Armor Plating
[2:59:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Is it full of rat pheromones or something? It can't be their waste as that would be like them wanting to eat their own poop.

[2:59:56] <dukenux> Plate armor
[2:59:56] <alexandrecau> rats do eat their own poop
[2:59:59] <Maldoree> I think the episanguis is made from the infected rats after shitting out whatever they ate, but like peatbog peter it takes awhile to accumulate
[3:00:01] <ElBuraindo> 5 damage

[3:00:09] <%TheKillerKalamari> shield is useless against rats
[3:00:10] <tank7013> The rats just seem to want to stick to their own little area sometimes. There's been a few times now where the characters should have been boned but the game was like "no it's fine"

[3:02:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> This whole city experimentation thing seems like a pre-historic racoon city with rats
[3:02:16] <PsychicKirby> @tank7013 It likely has something to do with Hugo's connection to the rats.

[3:04:10] <SpaceGuntank> now steal everything that isnt nailed down
[3:04:11] <$Tuskor13> They really should have just named this game "Ratsneak"
[3:04:14] <+CanonHusbando> now you can craft
[3:04:15] <shattywack> So this is what Plagues life is like
[3:04:22] <%TheKillerKalamari> you can craft it now pat
[3:04:23] <Paperware> Imagine if all these rats had a stand
[3:04:26] <CurrySauseBandit> Try upgrade again
[3:04:27] <+Thunder_Poo> epismemis is rare!
[3:04:39] <CriticKitten> Pat no, you can craft it now
[3:04:39] <Hellarussian> why are the rats being dickheads?
[3:04:41] <tank7013> So not only can making too much Luminosa lock you out of upgrades, but they also want you to use it to reach secret areas?
[3:04:41] <Delenay> werent you just missing the one yellow shit
[3:04:43] <+CanonHusbando> creft
[3:04:43] <$Tuskor13> @Paperware Watch the plot twist be the the rats ARE the stand

[3:05:17] <dukenux> very stumb
[3:05:19] <+tigerfang86> were those CRAFTING NOISES
[3:05:23] <%JackMillerTime> so california hobo trash is attracting rats which may brring typhus and bubonic plague, so this game got scarier.
[3:05:28] <Parapattern> Probably too rare to outfit an entire army with, though.
[3:05:31] <Maids4lyfe> nice
[3:05:31] <%skizzuto> maybe they're just really common in this area and they'll be rare later?
[3:05:32] <%Remery_> Rat crystals sounds gross
[3:05:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> Bet you will need them to craft more shit
[3:05:39] <$valriot> Rat Meth
[3:05:40] <$Tuskor13> You just got pockets full of pots, rat shit, rocks, and firebombs
[3:05:40] <%ElenaManetta> Maybe that one guy who was complaining about them being rare has his own mind goblins

[3:06:19] <%TG_Cid11> its a circle with a cone pat
[3:06:19] <%AncelDeLambert> tfw cloth is more rare than magic rat crystals
[3:06:20] <$Big_King_Coconut> just force the rats out of the alley
[3:06:21] <DracaenaLeaf> have him spot you again
[3:06:21] <$Mendin> Move light ito rats, throw pot into light, remove light?
[3:06:24] <tank7013> Maybe those rats are full?
[3:06:25] <Dragovus> You need to swing it away then back to force the rats into the alley for that guard to have a good time
[3:06:25] <Hellarussian> you can push the rats there
[3:06:27] <Unicyclemonkey> Scare the rats in his direction
[3:06:28] <rytisone> he stood there last time, cause he saw you a little bit

[3:09:24] <KingOfMidgard> nah l saw more poisoned water in that one vid of a guy swimming in a septic tank.
[3:09:25] <+Trtickster> Wouldn't the Inquisition try to get all the books out of the university though? Like, evacuate people and important items
[3:09:26] <$Tuskor13> Did he literally dip his hands right next to the human corpses and not care
[3:09:26] <energywarning> vita means life

[3:09:47] <a_shahid17> Have you replayed devil may cry since completing it?
[3:09:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If Fatalis is a name in this game, I'm gonna mark the hell out
[3:09:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> For honor man?#
[3:09:52] <Ion_Laser> my family...family...family
[3:09:54] <%athuramn> There's a temple in Asia where the dead are thrown in the water after ceremony as a passage to the afterlife. Also happens to poison their entire water supply
[3:09:55] <+Captain_Bear_Mode> Hi Pat, hope you're doing well :)
[3:09:56] <a_mad_dragon> time to assassinate
[3:10:01] <+tigerfang86> it's because her brother is the RAT KING
[3:10:03] <%joyoustechnoshrine> she has Magic Blood
[3:10:04] <Parapattern> It's in her blood though
[3:10:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Plaguee Gorl is S T R O N G
[3:10:05] <%Laecerelius> She's protected by the Rat King
[3:10:06] <$fatmanscreaming> immune
[3:10:06] <i_worship_his_shadow> does she even drink?
[3:10:06] <inderf> some people are resistant
[3:10:06] <Daxalog> Square Soap!!
[3:10:07] <%Remery_> Children are tough
[3:10:10] <切捨御免> RAT KING RAT KING
[3:10:10] <%HentaiSenpai9K> @saltyazteca I think you mean REVEEEEEEEEEEEEEENGE!!!
[3:10:13] <voyagerwitch> maybe shes the ellie
[3:10:15] <Dr_Mooose> yeah, should probably be covering her face
[3:10:16] <a_mad_dragon> she's a carrier Kappa
[3:10:17] <a_shahid17> I think devil may cry might be my game of the year. Don’t know any other game this year thag was that good
[3:10:18] <Delenay> well... if her brother has the big evil in his blood, what about her?
[3:10:19] <$KnivesEve> power of soap
[3:10:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's clearly the manifestation of her Rat Stand
[3:10:26] <dukenux> Hugo works like a disease sponge
[3:10:31] <megakruemel> I actually thought she was going to be sick from falling into a body pit when they escaped the camp with the thiefes
[3:10:32] <$Tuskor13> She's got the Protagonist Holy Blood running through her veins, protecting her from plot nonsense.
[3:10:33] <%JackMillerTime> filth builds the immune system
[3:10:34] <energywarning> perhaps stop thinking
[3:10:38] <%Remery_> Cmon the boy is just hitting puberty early
[3:10:39] <%DonatelloJose> We should have gotten a plague doctor mask by now.
[3:10:40] <%TheKillerKalamari> hit the cages with rocks
[3:10:40] <tank7013> @Delenay I think they mentioned Hugo being adopted
[3:10:42] <a_shahid17> Sekiro is not better than devil may cry
[3:10:42] <+tigerfang86> RAT CAGES?
[3:10:45] <+BoomerTiro> In cages and they havn't turned to green flame
[3:10:46] <KingOfMidgard> orphans are immune to plagues
[3:10:48] <Aoworth> She probably just bathes more than once a year
[3:10:51] <%TheKillerKalamari> release the rats
[3:10:51] <切捨御免> monkaHmm
[3:10:52] <%Laecerelius> ooooh
[3:10:53] <+TheRegalPeasant> Rich Privilege gives rat immunity
[3:10:55] <KingOfMidgard> they are natural allies
[3:10:56] <megakruemel> release the rats
[3:10:56] <Parapattern> Rat shower!
[3:11:00] <megakruemel> yesssss
[3:11:01] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Fun fact, thee plague was spread by the FLEAS on the rats, not thee rats theemselves
[3:11:05] <$valriot> Sekiro isnt even better than other FromSoft games LUL

[3:11:34] <Intolerable> TACTICAL RATS
[3:11:36] <$Tuskor13> @fatmanscreaming better question is how did they have a cage of rats suspended midair with no rats falling out
[3:11:38] <+EySoyCoco> i would play dumb tbh
[3:11:38] <SpaceGuntank> why did that dude even have a shield?
[3:11:39] <%HentaiSenpai9K> @vietcongsamurai Where's that emote from? LUL
[3:11:40] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Had his walkman on
[3:11:46] <切捨御免> shit like this probably happens all the time, considering this whole situation
[3:11:49] <Aoworth> @Bane_Kaikyo hence why bathing regularly lessened the chance of getting it
[3:11:50] <+EySoyCoco> rats what rats
[3:11:51] <$Tuskor13> @SpaceGuntank to block the rats obviously
[3:11:51] <tank7013> More importantly how do these guards just immediately know the sound of a sling?
[3:11:52] <Shastafield> how was that wooden cage keeping them

[3:13:01] <energywarning> see, that scope was super useful
[3:13:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Hey did you know there's an extra special, secret ending if you don't kill anyone? ;)
[3:13:13] <rytisone> cant wait for 360 no scope kills
[3:13:16] <%Bluwizard21> it's great how they give zero shits about their friends dying. like that guy could have just dragged his light over there and saved at least the one guy
[3:13:21] <aimlesshealer> @Valentinius_Anodyne Damn, well I hope some rattomancy happens soon LUL

[3:14:52] <Maids4lyfe> did pat throw acid on his head?
[3:14:55] <+Zaramoth> was that a war crime
[3:14:58] <%Remery_> Are Slingshots that effective and are they banned in countries?
[3:15:08] <$fatmanscreaming> but what about the pacifist ending
[3:15:11] <+tigerfang86> big time crime
[3:15:12] <KingOfMidgard> THAT WAS THE BlGGEST WAR CRlME!

[3:15:25] <Maids4lyfe> @ElenaManetta a rock thrown from a sling like that can kill a person every time
[3:15:26] <%ScottishMadJacko> Some slingshots are really powerful and banned
[3:15:28] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "hmm, this wall is inteeresting"
[3:15:28] <KingOfMidgard> Also Slingshots can be more powerful than slings
[3:15:30] <+Swaggamanca> So it's the last of us: dishonored edition
[3:15:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Very interesting, this wall here. Keeps me occupied

[3:21:37] <%DonatelloJose> I can hear that purr. What a sweet boy.
[3:21:38] <+Daidis> dad stahpppp not in front of your friends
[3:21:38] <flying_man_3> "he will get all cuddly" as he runs away
[3:21:56] <Maldoree> Hah, elmo's meow summoned a cat to my window
[3:22:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> when he screams at you it's because he wants your attention. cats don't meow in the feral.
[3:22:07] <aimlesshealer> BEHOLD
[3:22:10] <%Sabre_Basilisk> hey @AngriestPat how good is the epic stores shopping cart feature?
[3:22:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat wtf is a "lawnmower cat"???
[3:22:19] <%ElenaManetta> He cuts the grass?
[3:22:21] <narusao> he's just playing coy to lure in more cuddles
[3:22:32] <Shishi1205> are they using instruments in thre
[3:22:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> What is that sound?
[3:22:34] <%ElenaManetta> ur step son
[3:22:39] <%king_wragles> @FirearmsInstructor he's a lawnmower cat because he always comes back... like a lawnmower
[3:22:40] <FirearmsInstructor> lol ok ;)
[3:22:45] <%CJett92> That almost makes sense. Almost
[3:22:46] <Rigmarole111> His motor's running
[3:22:50] <$Big_King_Coconut> also he mows Pat's lawn
[3:22:51] <narusao> pat logic
[3:22:52] <%Bluwizard21> the VR section of Lawnmower cat was trippy
[3:22:53] <KawaiiJetty> That's elmo power
[3:22:55] <%ElenaManetta> It makes sense because Pat has never operated a lawnmower before
[3:22:57] <+Thunder_Poo> what is that?
[3:22:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Cats eat grass when they have an upset stomach.
[3:23:03] <Xelhesia> i think thats a vocal chord issue?
[3:23:04] <worldbrand> YEAH+
[3:23:06] <aimlesshealer> If you convinced Elmo that grass is a type of hair, he'd become a real lawnmower
[3:23:07] <aeonicvector> Lawnmower cat never passed consumer testing, thats an unliscenced product
[3:23:08] <Ion_Laser> ye ye ye

[3:27:33] <+Thrassey> rats
[3:27:34] <alrobot2014> to test your resolve
[3:27:35] <Hazlet95> why does the game talk like plague ?
[3:27:35] <%QuadraticGravity> THEY'RE TESTING YOU
[3:27:36] <+RC_S3kshun8> oh shit I'm in the GoT finale all over again
[3:27:36] <Vitoria90> I can't stand crafting systems in 9/10 games at this point, to be honest.
[3:27:38] <CurrySauseBandit> They throw tons of material though.
[3:27:39] <+Deano8817> because you are a weak willed mind goblin
[3:27:40] <+bear_breaker20> uh Monhun got on game pass... whats a gud first weapon
[3:27:42] <aimlesshealer> I know right? It's hard to tell what the game will want you to do sometimes...
[3:27:43] <%HentaiSenpai9K> apatGoblin slayer
