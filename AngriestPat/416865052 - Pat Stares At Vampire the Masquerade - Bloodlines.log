[0:14:14] <sindegra> and I read online that the really high up tzmische are unearthly beautiful because they're perfected the craft?

[0:14:20] <JayEarly> Tzimisce are famously gracious hosts though
[0:14:20] <%stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Not demons, flesh-shapers. He changed himself to look like that. Tzimisce could theoretically make themselves beautiful, the edgy fucks just choose not to.
[0:14:21] <%joylent_blue> Too_Much_Nukie why would he choose to look like a huge nerd though
[0:14:21] <%razorknight> Illegals monkaS

[0:16:17] <+sirbloodcake> Imagine fighting bosses and not playing Gangrel LUL
[0:16:17] <%spiritofmojave> Why is this Spell-Chad vampire not using spells
[0:16:18] <%brakkathoom> Dracula used to juice off Tzimisce blood in WoD cannon
[0:16:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> Actual representation of Pat fighting off mind goblins
[0:16:19] <+Anonymasque> @Slimshazbot Has anyone asked if he's SURE he mastered fleshcrafting? He looks like he didn't study for the exam at all

[0:16:36] <%spiritofmojave> GUNMANCER
[0:16:36] <%stabbityrabbit> Fun fact! @AngriestPat The Tzimisce ability to flesh-craft is actually a DISEASE. The eldest members of their clan don't have the ability, instead being able to shape the earth as they see fit. Very few people in setting know this though.
[0:16:37] <%Shikari21> these enemies are quite loud
[0:16:37] <%NWR_James> Be a badass vampire. Use an ax
[0:16:38] <+Afrobrawler> @AngriestPat you can hotkey the spells

[0:20:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat This level is called The Warrens. It's the most hated part of the game and considered by many to be the worst sewer level of its time. God bless, I won't help you find your way.
[0:20:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> is that gasp song
[0:20:42] <%Rngiddion> welcome to the sewers, hope you enjoy the most sewer level a sewer level has ever been

[0:21:20] <%deviljhojho94> basically
[0:21:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> They don't have enough Michael Jan Vincents for all these quadrants.

[0:21:46] <shotgang86> yeah its baaaaaaaaad, stealth here is mandatory
[0:21:46] <%Caitiri> If your lockpick is high enough you can skip most of it
[0:21:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Hell no you do not.
[0:21:47] <%manwithboxonhead> LUL
[0:21:48] <%deviljhojho94> not necesarily

[0:21:53] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat No sarcasm, but if you wanted to just say "Fuck it" and use noclip to progress at some point I don't think anyone would blame you
[0:21:55] <MrGremy> genocide the geodudes
[0:21:56] <jijipose> Should have installed the plus patch, it lets you skip 3/4 of it LUL
[0:21:56] <+dukenux> You'd expect some Zubats here as well
[0:21:57] <%deviljhojho94> easier said than done

[0:22:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> big cirlce

[0:26:55] <finalgrinder> just try them all :)
[0:26:56] <%VioletHeart> Is the intro for this game the same if you pick Nosferatu? Just in bed with a horrible gremlin monster?
[0:26:57] <%DirtyGaijin> do you see!
[0:26:59] <%TenderBabyBacon> @madhattergay that's a pretty good reason
[0:27:01] <%Caitiri> aand go in the seewr
[0:27:02] <%joylent_blue> you can do it :
[0:27:03] <+TheSaintJohn> worst zone in the game

[0:27:10] <Zooperton> oh boy the sewer level PogChamp
[0:27:14] <shotgang86> oh pat, its just the beggining

[0:27:19] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! On Tzimice; Montreal by Night says that one of these guys hangs out in La Ronde October through May, using homeless from Lachine Canal to fuel his experiments. Don’t worry for your family though, Laval is “An occasional distraction” to the Sabbat
[0:27:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @violetheart It's implied thatbthey used Obfuscate to look normal
[0:27:21] <%mh9s> you fist real good
[0:27:21] <heybenice> @starkandstag Everyone knows all monster noises are actually just big cats sped up or slowed down
[0:27:23] <TwinBat> 0
[0:27:24] <%VioletHeart> Neat.
[0:27:24] <%DirtyGaijin> fists seem to have a quicker attack animation
[0:27:27] <shotgang86> at least after this part those abominations will not appear again
[0:27:28] <LtSergei> remember to use your chalice when it's at 10, it can't hold more than that
[0:27:31] <RupanSen> fist those pokemans

[0:27:37] <MrGremy> i want to see art of pat punching geodudes LUL
[0:27:38] <waj9876> @VioletHeart The Nosferatu can make themselves look normal with a discipline. It costs blood though.
[0:27:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> Whimpy nerd vampire punches flesh monsters
[0:27:40] <12gagerager> Anyone know why sewer levels are on average the worst levels in a game?
[0:27:40] <CopperTucker> I need to kill fast and BULLETS TOO SLOW
[0:27:41] <shotgang86> because their growl get old fast

[0:27:53] <ScreamingMeat> TAB
[0:27:54] <TheRagingLeo> why the hell is tab block
[0:27:55] <PSI_Guy95> Tab is block with melee and alt mode for guns
[0:27:56] <+CaptainJax> you rebound it
[0:27:59] <KeystoneA1> switch it to B
[0:28:00] <%DirtyGaijin> I cast Greater Fist

[0:28:09] <ScreamingMeat> LUL
[0:28:10] <TwinBat> more than halfway in the game "is there a block"
[0:28:10] <a1u5> If only there was a tutorial
[0:28:11] <%astropupp> astropupp subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:28:11] <RupanSen> I usually map it on right mouse button
[0:28:13] <strongweeb> it stands for thin and beautiful
[0:28:14] <Badgerconda_> I think all blocking does mechanically though is add your dex to your dodge rating, Pat.
[0:28:14] <%joylent_blue> shut up, you're awful
[0:28:17] <+McSoliace> One Punch-Man season 2 looks real weird
[0:28:17] <depressedpepega> Its like sen's fortress but with traps replaced with awful level design.
[0:28:18] <jay521> You can duck under the geodudes when they attack
[0:28:19] <%Sulliman34> why not put it on q
[0:28:19] <%augusm> I've completed this game seven times and have never blocked once
[0:28:20] <+SmoochSpider> crawl through pipe
[0:28:21] <+Goliz> Blocking is for cowards anyways
[0:28:21] <BunnyEmperor> dead ends are a failure of game design
[0:28:21] <%laserbeaming> Old PC games DansGame
[0:28:21] <%MagickBurritoh> tab is fine
[0:28:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> This was before the standards were solidified pat
[0:28:26] <%augusm> today I learned

[0:28:30] <%deviljhojho94> you can turn full auto on your gun with tab too-!
[0:28:31] <%Caitiri> yessss
[0:28:34] <benhart18> its through the woolie hole, but which one?
[0:28:37] <%Sulliman34> also why the fuck is pat a blood golem
[0:28:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Blocking is for cowards anyways
[0:28:47] <TwinBat> tab keeps your pinky strong
[0:28:47] <+TheWallOfMeat> such a shame Pat will never use full auto
[0:28:47] <%deviljhojho94> indeed

[0:29:18] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah your shortcut would be here
[0:29:21] <%augusm> @AngriestPat go back into that little hidey hold and check the super dark black bit on the floor
[0:29:22] <@commanderclaw> @king_wragles The Sabbat is mostly Tzimice and Lasombra. The former you've met, the latter are darkness manipulators
[0:29:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat is now a Teenage Mutant Ninja Vampire

[0:30:53] <+dukenux> Vampires don't like running water, fool!
[0:30:54] <SparkAfterDark> Vampires are extremely weak to running water. you're lucky you can even do this at all
[0:30:54] <%DirtyGaijin> water = bad
[0:30:57] <Sterawlings> up until he sewers you could talk your way through the game instead of fighting. the sewers ruins that
[0:30:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Why is Pat made of Jell-O?

[0:31:51] <+sourceofall> go straight to the ladder
[0:31:53] <jessicaamado> PAT WAKE UP
[0:31:55] <KaliasTV> I forget, is there any good game left or are we now in Endless Trash?

[0:32:09] <+Chocolatevgz> Yeah there's plenty of good game left
[0:32:10] <+Anonymasque> @Shikari21 DAMMIT was it before the really awful fleshmaster guy?
[0:32:10] <%laserbeaming> I like how you are dripping blood underwater
[0:32:13] <kingra> @deviljhojho94 Nice to see you too my dude tomatoJoy
[0:32:14] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat plus patch is worth it alone just for the shortcut to skip this shit area
[0:32:14] <%Disname23> you can FEEL the crunch time
[0:32:14] <+CaptainJax> GEODUDE
[0:32:16] <%AncelDeLambert> splash
[0:32:17] <waj9876> @Ganerumo Blood shield. It's a spell.
[0:32:19] <a1u5> And now we begin to see where the game becomes unfinished
[0:32:22] <%deviljhojho94> @kingra tomatoHappy
[0:32:23] <Thepothero> @deviljhojho94 many are the rat kings men tomatoRat
[0:32:27] <+Mittensbro> can i just mention, this third person camera is doodo
[0:32:27] <%Ganerumo> @waj9876 looks like the Gmod material tool lmao
[0:32:27] <+Chocolatevgz> And yeah plus patch has an optional shortcut for this and the malkavian mansion too
[0:32:29] <切捨御免> a u s p e x
[0:32:33] <a1u5> Look for lights in tinnels
[0:32:33] <@Pandora_Prime> CLOGGED WITH POOP
[0:32:36] <%deviljhojho94> @Thepothero And mighty is his brood indeed tomatoRat
[0:32:37] <ChamoCamouflage> Pat, Auspex
[0:32:40] <%augusm> sanitation department has to pad funds
[0:32:43] <%Shikari21> @Anonymasque yep lmao. there might be some more later but most of the vampire tits are early
[0:32:44] <%manwithboxonhead> Get Prepare for Fake Tunnels
[0:32:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Rats are the real MVP
[0:32:47] <SparkAfterDark> Why don't more Kindred have big dogs or other pets to snack on in an emergency. I feel like if you're gonna eat rats, you might as well buy a few 100+lb dogs and keep them instead. Bonus perk is that you have dogs now
[0:32:49] <%AncelDeLambert> You can do iiiiiiit
[0:32:51] <TwinBat> big boi jump
[0:32:55] <%kiiiirsten> We didn't even edit the jaguar sound a lil bit? We just kept it pure jaguar? C'mon guys
[0:32:58] <PsychicKirby> @Thepothero We are never-ending brother tomatoRat
[0:33:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Be prepared for this fucking shit.
[0:33:04] <$konekoryugamine> Oh GOD this SUCS ASS
[0:33:05] <waj9876> Him quicksaving randomly makes me think the stream is freezing.
[0:33:06] <%AncelDeLambert> time for puzzles
[0:33:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I doubt Pat will figure this out.
[0:33:11] <%OldOnyx> well the plus patch stuff in the mansion is a new area (that doesn't make much sense) rather than a shortcut
[0:33:13] <%mr_macho_muchacho> @InugamiTheHound his auspex is too low to be useful
[0:33:13] <%DirtyGaijin> @SparkAfterDark i think thats what ghouls are for really
[0:33:17] <%augusm> @AngriestPat You must use physics to proceed
[0:33:20] <+Anonymasque> @Shikari21 Oh so the tiddies are just to get you a few hours into the game so the only way out is to finish it. Got it.
[0:33:20] <theshillman> dont dogs freak out around vampires?
[0:33:20] <Kain5707> are those just half life barrels?
[0:33:21] <Ion_Laser> this level is a goddamn mess
[0:33:24] <Daxalog> I like the jaguar noise
[0:33:25] <LtSergei> can he figure it out
[0:33:28] <%Laecerelius> they're coming outta the walls, man!
[0:33:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sparkafterdark I believe that you can ghoul animals
[0:33:32] <AllTheZibas> THERES ONE IN THE WATER LUL
[0:33:34] <starotter70> Those are half life barrels
[0:33:35] <%razorknight> Jeb is a big fat mess
[0:33:36] <tinypouf> this part in specific is especially bad
[0:33:37] <+CaptainJax> Pat has evolved to PUNCH BLOOD WIZARD
[0:33:38] <+ShadowArcangel> no way he`ll figure out
[0:33:38] <+TheBitingIrish> @SparkAfterDark Maybe dogs know they're vamps?
[0:33:38] <cacophanes> save
[0:33:41] <RupanSen> It's just a Half Life 2 physics puzzle
[0:33:42] <+ShadowArcangel> oh noooo
[0:33:42] <%Shikari21> @Anonymasque personally its come for tits then stay for the atmosphere and story

[0:33:58] <natebud> Physics was No part of that puzzle
[0:34:01] <SparkAfterDark> My dog knows I'm a weeaboo and he still loves me. Dogs are forgiving
[0:34:03] <+ProfessorDetective052996> @SparkAfterDark Some Kindred with Animalism can Blood Bond animals, but you need to drain a cow to get any decent blood.
[0:34:06] <waj9876> @DirtyGaijin That is what they're for. You can make animals ghouls too.

[0:38:18] <%DSD24> Go with the flow
[0:38:20] <natebud> This sewer water is so clean
[0:38:22] <%Solidnick18> what a sewer
[0:38:23] <DracaenaLeaf> how the fuck did you avoid the time limit
[0:38:25] <SparkAfterDark> @ProfessorDetective052996 Yes obviously it's inferior, but my point is that eating seer rats is somewhat common, especially among new or weak vampires and that HAS to be the WORST possible blood in existence. So why the fuck wouldn't it be more common to feed on better more common and more easily kept/explainable animals?
[0:38:29] <切捨御免> Clap
[0:38:30] <%augusm> thar we go
[0:38:30] <%Shikari21> @theneosloth oh guess i skipped this stuff somehow haha

[0:38:36] <%AncelDeLambert> it's all worth it
[0:38:37] <+Justlaxy> I started to use no clip cause I couldn't go into the graveyard and it toke me forever to figure that out.
[0:38:37] <jessicaamado> @starotter70 I bet he'll want to climb on top and will do a ladder piling up things around
[0:38:40] <+Goliz> I just keep trying until it works
[0:38:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> OH MY GOD HE DID

[0:39:38] <MyDarkStorm> too legit to quit?
[0:39:38] <fairore> oh I see why this level sucks

[0:39:41] <dsauce999> Too LEGIT, Too LEGIT to QUIT
[0:39:41] <SparkAfterDark> It's like, if it was common to eat literal rotting garbage whenever you get hungry, but nobody would ever eat fast food. If they eat rats why not dogs?
[0:39:41] <gustavozxd> i'd rather gain nothing and learn nothing over playing through this again

[0:52:04] <+TheSaintJohn> snipper riffle
[0:52:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> @outlawmap makes sense.
[0:52:06] <KeystoneA1> Canadians
[0:52:13] <MyDarkStorm> YOU GOt Blood
[0:52:15] <dsauce999> 30-08?
[0:52:18] <%DSD24> @devanmuse Its a item that increases heath regen
[0:52:19] <%LozsCat> its 308 not 30-08
[0:52:19] <rovilm> snipper
[0:52:27] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @AngriestPat Boi! THAT IS NOT THE SAME.
[0:52:30] <%TheKillerKalamari> He has to hold onto everything he might need it
[0:52:33] <$Brother_Coduss> gun enthusiasts every cringe
[0:52:34] <heybenice> Is there a repeatable source of income in this game?
[0:52:34] <theshillman> yes, 30-08. pat is a well note expert on GUN
[0:52:34] <LtSergei> it's actually .38
[0:52:41] <%augusm> I love my 500. SNiper
[0:52:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's .308
[0:52:46] <waj9876> "Against final boss" NO I MIGHT NEED IT
[0:52:47] <%TheKillerKalamari> The Goblins wont allow him to get rid of anything
[0:52:47] <Atheistpreacher> Could have just gone to the red spot
[0:52:48] <natebud> LUL animations
[0:52:48] <切捨御免> it's america so it's fine
[0:52:51] <+dukenux> it's 30.8 actually
[0:52:52] <BunnyEmperor> its like nobody who lives there cares that there is a huge blood trail leading to his room
[0:52:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Read chalice description
[0:52:53] <+ArmaIy> it's america, you're fine
[0:52:53] <CrabSlacks> nobody cares it's america
[0:52:53] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> this games hold up so well

[0:53:10] <CrabSlacks> and you're white
[0:53:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ArmaIy its a bit weird you are reloading without emptying the clip into the sky first
[0:53:27] <KeystoneA1> Put it on full auto
[0:53:27] <+CaptainJax> Back to geodudes
[0:53:27] <$Brother_Coduss> @ArmaIy yeah but it's california, they're too liberal for that
[0:53:28] <a1u5> This is America
[0:53:29] <RupanSen> buy the magnum in hollywood
[0:53:31] <natebud> I bet that crossbow does crazy lethal damage
[0:53:33] <Vohs_Bru> your AK shotgun
[0:53:35] <+EdenOfLove> magnum
[0:53:36] <alexandrecau> open carry for the win
[0:53:36] <%augusm> Its pronounced Three Thousand Zero Hundred and Noughty Eight
[0:53:42] <outlawmap> The game only takes places over like a few days, it's not hard to believe he hasn't cleaned it up
[0:53:44] <ZZCooldown> more guns for his melee build yeah boi!
[0:53:45] <%DirtyGaijin> i mean in america you get strange looks for not openly wielding guns in the street
[0:53:45] <%PaladinDupre> In real life, AR style shotguns are usually terrible
[0:53:49] <%Agami23> gun up. the worst show on twitchivision
[0:53:51] <%MagickBurritoh> 0 melee
[0:53:51] <%LozsCat> was that a spas 15?
[0:53:51] <DracaenaLeaf> good
[0:53:51] <%SolidusRex> I think the plus patch improves the gun models unless I'm wrong.
[0:53:54] <%valkuma> Firearms over melee 100%
[0:53:56] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Don't forget defense skills (Dodge)
[0:53:56] <CrabSlacks> perception
[0:53:56] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> never trust in hollywood
[0:53:58] <+CaptainJax> Pump auspex
[0:53:58] <MyDarkStorm> Not Melee
[0:53:59] <RupanSen> perception yes
[0:53:59] <sindegra> perceptionnnn
[0:54:00] <Sterawlings> firearms
[0:54:00] <%Shikari21> go brawl big fists
[0:54:00] <televisedrevolting> GUN
[0:54:03] <%DirtyGaijin> ranged
[0:54:04] <Sterawlings> firear. a
[0:54:07] <%spiritofmojave> Brawl? You're using fists quite a bit
[0:54:07] <LtSergei> you can auspex for temporary perception
[0:54:07] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> def
[0:54:08] <KeystoneA1> Ranged, brawl, or dodge will help
[0:54:09] <gustavozxd> guns become insanely op from now on
[0:54:10] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @PaladinDupre You're so right it hurts.
[0:54:10] <%MagickBurritoh> what is subterfuge
[0:54:10] <%PaladinDupre> especially AR style pump shotguns
[0:54:11] <%Mekhet09> Perception.
[0:54:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat You'll want 8 persuasion once you get to Chinatown.
[0:54:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Gun gun gun gun
[0:54:13] <rosemon5001> GUN MAGI INCREASED
[0:54:14] <%TheKillerKalamari> Yeah, don't be a glass cannon
[0:54:14] <waj9876> Perception is better until you catch up.
[0:54:15] <Sterawlings> brawl is good too
[0:54:16] <$madhattergay> @DirtyGaijin i dont think thats true inLA tho
[0:54:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ranged is what you want to raise
[0:54:20] <@Pandora_Prime> Wo wo wo wo
[0:54:21] <%Mekhet09> You want attributes.
[0:54:25] <outlawmap> Range is only crazy good if you are Toreador
[0:54:25] <%TheKillerKalamari> Number go up
[0:54:25] <%OldOnyx> plus patch doesn't touch up most of the gun models once
[0:54:26] <%augusm> Blood Shield can account for your shit defense to some degree
[0:54:26] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat perception, firearms and auspex makes guns op
[0:54:26] <BunnyEmperor> BOWOWOWOWOW
[0:54:27] <PhantaniumOG> Auspex gives you perception
[0:54:27] <%Mekhet09> They work on more shit.
[0:54:28] <starotter70> WO WO WO WO
[0:54:30] <outlawmap> Otherwise it's okay
[0:54:32] <+ArcLifth> WOWOWO
[0:54:33] <%spiritofmojave> WAOWAOWAO
[0:54:34] <%OldOnyx> *much
[0:54:34] <PowerfulBlackGangs> WOWOWOW
[0:54:37] <%Agami23> to quote what a wise man once said, the best defence is a overwhelming offence
[0:54:37] <%Shikari21> WOWOWOWO
[0:54:38] <%PaladinDupre> @TheOnlyStrayCat the Saiga is like the one good magazine fed shotgun
[0:54:38] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> wowowow
[0:54:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Waowaowaowao
[0:54:39] <dsauce999> waowaowao
[0:54:40] <$Brother_Coduss> @PaladinDupre what, you mean like AA12?
[0:54:41] <gustavozxd> aw best part of the WOWOWOW
[0:54:46] <%joylent_blue> WAOWAO- awwww
[0:54:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ah yeah, Auspex is a useful buff to gunpires
[0:54:46] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> WOOOOO!
[0:54:49] <cacophanes> get the baller revolver from Redspot
[0:54:52] <gustavozxd> hi dad
[0:54:54] <ミュウレ4242> oh, am i in time for china town? noice.
[0:54:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Agami23 Rogal Dorn Disagrees
[0:55:00] <sindegra> access point C?
[0:55:01] <%PlumpPotatoRump> hi son
[0:55:03] <%PaladinDupre> @Brother_Coduss the AA12 is at least semi auto,
[0:55:08] <Sterawlings> I am fortifying this position
[0:55:10] <gustavozxd> @ミュウレ4242 he's almost done with the sewers
[0:55:12] <shotgang86> from here on its way more combat in this game, you will need to invest in those skills
[0:55:13] <CrabSlacks> It turns out replacing the music in this game is really easy
[0:55:20] <12gagerager> Red spot's got a magnum.
[0:55:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Read chalice description. I think it used to be a dude.
[0:55:21] <rovilm> Main big sewer save
[0:55:29] <%PaladinDupre> But in general a classic tube fed pump shotgun is the way to go
[0:55:34] <natebud> Red Spot big magnum
[0:55:37] <%SolidusRex> Fun fact: If you noclip, the sewers are ABOVE the city for some reason.
[0:55:37] <fearhurst> It's a source game all the sounds are easily replaceable
[0:55:37] <outlawmap> Read the ledger
[0:55:37] <linkinbird> Door on the Left = Alley on the Right
[0:55:41] <%LozsCat> pretty sure that shotgun was spas 15
[0:55:42] <$Brother_Coduss> @PaladinDupre the CIVILIAN model is semi, the regular model is Full
[0:55:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ledger
[0:55:49] <%Mekhet09> Damn.
[0:55:54] <benhart18> the solution is sesame
[0:55:57] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat you should buy the colt anaconda from the store in hollywood
[0:55:58] <MyDarkStorm> Question? Can your character change clothes and if so is there a red coat in the game?
[0:56:01] <waj9876> @GeneralSCPatton It was made by the Tsimize, of course it used to be a dude. That whole nightmare house used to be people.
[0:56:03] <rovilm> Ah we're up to the worst part in the game?
[0:56:08] <a1u5> Go down Pat
[0:56:09] <PsychicKirby> clap
[0:56:09] <%lilytastic> we're still in the sewers?
[0:56:09] <LtSergei> don't forget blood strike
[0:56:11] <grayjammer> The Midair
[0:56:13] <%PaladinDupre> @Brother_Coduss i mean as opposed to pump action. The AR shotgun pat has in the game is pump action
[0:56:15] <starotter70> @rovilm Yup
[0:56:17] <%Disname23> we're here forever
[0:56:23] <rovilm> @starotter70 Niceeeee
[0:56:23] <+dukenux> characters can dress, but every Clan gets specific clothes afaik
[0:56:24] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:56:26] <artistdavidharper> Basically.
[0:56:26] <fearhurst> Is this a rocky scenario
[0:56:27] <%DSD24> @MyDarkStorm Yes you can change clothes and I know for a fact that Toreadors get a red suit
[0:56:27] <+TheSaintJohn> pop
[0:56:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> We're about 3/5ths through the Warrens.
[0:56:31] <rovilm> Let us all suffer this together
[0:56:34] <waj9876> @rovilm Yeah, there are a few more spots of questionable quality, but it's nowhere as bad as this.
[0:56:36] <$konekoryugamine> Oh great, SEWER GOBLINS
[0:56:40] <%DirtyGaijin> @doc_ock_rokc also i think you mean Lord Adorable
[0:56:40] <starotter70> @rovilm He already did the pump puzzle
[0:56:44] <fearhurst> Were about 3/5ths of a person
[0:56:45] <MyDarkStorm> Awesoeme
[0:56:45] <%IckyGyki> We suffer together in the sewers
[0:56:47] <MyDarkStorm> awesome
[0:56:50] <rafamoreiramano7777777777> Yakuza 7 is looking great
[0:56:50] <%Laecerelius> BIG SUCC
[0:56:53] <shotgang86> amazing
[0:56:56] <%Agami23> @doc_ock_rokc rogal dorn died for being too much not offence
[0:57:01] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah, obfuscate is amazing
[0:57:02] <rovilm> I don't remember the pump puzzle, hm
[0:57:06] <+ProfessorDetective052996> That and you get two blood points per rat.
[0:57:06] <PsychicKirby> tomatoRat tomatoRat tomatoRat
[0:57:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DirtyGaijin Lord adornable
[0:57:09] <artoflec> imagine if you COULDNT succ the rats
[0:57:09] <CrabSlacks> doing this as a ventrue must be a huge pain in the ass
[0:57:09] <$konekoryugamine> Obfuscate nothing, live for everything
[0:57:15] <%SolidusRex> That, and Nosferatu get extra blood from rats.
[0:57:15] <DracaenaLeaf> you can stealth the thing fine as anyone. I did it as a Toreador
[0:57:16] <ミュウレ4242> couldn't a nossy just stealth past?
[0:57:17] <%valkuma> nosferatu ARENT getting bodied, thats why theyre in hiding
[0:57:21] <RupanSen> no
[0:57:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No
[0:57:24] <%Caitiri> Nosferatu get extra blood from rats
[0:57:24] <mr_slaide> wat?
[0:57:24] <shotgang86> imagine coming here as that clan that gets sick eating rats
[0:57:27] <%Laecerelius> so much succ
[0:57:29] <natebud> I don't want to imagine a world where I can't suck rats
[0:57:29] <starotter70> @rovilm oh, it sucks so bad
[0:57:34] <HeadsHeldHigh> Ventrues are tanks in this game
[0:57:38] <$madhattergay> so why didnt pat choose malcavian?
[0:57:38] <%DSD24> Also Nosferatu go invisible
[0:57:39] <waj9876> @CrabSlacks If blood boil works on the big dudes I'm pretty sure dominate's version of it works too.
[0:57:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @shotgang86 I don't have to, it sucks.
[0:57:41] <%DirtyGaijin> @doc_ock_rokc im not even mad at that
[0:57:42] <$saturnianocean> jermaChomp
[0:57:43] <NewWaveMasquerade> Ooohh he's going to have so much fun in that room!
[0:57:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @waj9876 I guess Tzimisce would adapt well to the ethical quandaries of being a Wraith. "Oh, we're crafting everything with souls instead of flesh now? Fucking rad!"
[0:57:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, Ventrue really don't enjoy this part of the game
[0:57:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ventrues are tanks in the tabletop game too.
[0:57:49] <%Disname23> Ventrue here are fucking awful
[0:57:53] <%spiritofmojave> Imagine not eating rats in 2004
[0:57:54] <%DSD24> @madhattergay That's a bad clan for a first playthough
[0:57:54] <mr_slaide> We love you, ELMO!!!!
[0:57:55] <+Majorpainful> Ventrues are gigaop in other parts of the game so it makes up for it
[0:58:00] <+BoomerTiro> So which clan did pat join? hot Topic, Spencers, Gap, Old Navy?
[0:58:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ventrue are tanks that brainwash DPS for them.
[0:58:07] <outlawmap> Vampires don't become wraiths
[0:58:12] <Sloavon> this city is fucking disgusting with all these rats everywhere
[0:58:12] <%DSD24> @BoomerTiro Tremere
[0:58:13] <+ShadowArcangel> big scares
[0:58:14] <misterbackdown> SUCC EMLO
[0:58:14] <%JollyHeracross> can you blood salvo rats? that animation takes so long for little yield
[0:58:18] <BaskerTheHound> it sounds like its saying JOOJOOO
[0:58:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DirtyGaijin Its not mine really. Its from the "If the Emporor had a podcast"
[0:58:23] <ミュウレ4242> i wonder if 2 will have dominated followers for situations like thios.
[0:58:26] <waj9876> @GeneralSCPatton They'd probably hate that though, they fucking LOVE being vampires.
[0:58:30] <MyDarkStorm> Just kill them
[0:58:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> SAVE
[0:58:31] <KeystoneA1> The Chad Ventrue
[0:58:32] <+BoomerTiro> Gap
[0:58:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> THIS PART BUGS OFTEN
[0:58:37] <gustavozxd> ventrue lets you play as wesker at the end of the game tho
[0:58:38] <%Laecerelius> oooh
[0:58:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> patty

[1:05:31] <+Mondeiya> Welcome to sewer dungeon PART TWO
[1:05:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> ok so I wasn't imagining things
[1:05:32] <+Majorpainful> SOurce engine
[1:05:32] <KeystoneA1> Well it is the source engine
[1:05:33] <%spiritofmojave> it basically is
[1:05:33] <%Das_Bass> ironic
[1:05:34] <Badgerconda_> it... literally is half life, pat.
[1:05:35] <+dukenux> It's Source
[1:05:35] <%DSD24> We most go deeper
[1:05:36] <Badgerconda_> it's the same engine.
[1:05:38] <takiyami> that last room was very similar to a room from hl1
[1:05:38] <Deekman> @Teintstein the cube is love, the cube is life
[1:05:38] <%laserbeaming> It's completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the game. 10/10
[1:05:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> I AM A POTATO
[1:05:41] <%MagickBurritoh> DID IT
[1:05:42] <+Chocolatevgz> weeeeeee
[1:05:42] <Sterawlings> there's a steel beam in there I tried to make a bridge with because I didn't see thst tiny ledge
[1:05:42] <rovilm> They used cut levels from HL2 in bloodlines
[1:05:43] <+thebonebard> but it does have half life shooting kind of
[1:05:44] <CptBritches> Weird it's almost like it's on the same engine whoooaaaaa

[1:06:41] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> my eyes!!!!
[1:06:41] <%AncelDeLambert> THIS is why the sewers are the worst
[1:06:41] <%TheKillerKalamari> boss becomes a regular enemy trope
[1:06:44] <+TheWallOfMeat> everybody's favorite: miniboss becomes regular enemy
[1:06:45] <rovilm> sewers need to be made this big for all the giant american poops
[1:06:46] <+TheSaintJohn> boss to normal enemy in less than 2 minutes
[1:06:46] <%Thalchampz> what IS that
[1:06:46] <mrgrimsmiles> use the alt fire
[1:06:47] <CrabSlacks> boss to enemy at record speed

[1:07:01] <Deekman> this music is very half lifey
[1:07:02] <sindegra> bust out those blood bags. please
[1:07:03] <yigs_kitchen_sink> @AngriestPat Pat, against those tri-body monsters, it's far more cost-effective to use the level 1 blood strike instead of blood boil, it's cheaper and still does great damage, better bang for your buck (blood)
[1:07:05] <%augusm> Pat you're gonna ahve to suck on them bloodbags for this one
[1:07:05] <%titans_ace_jerid> titans_ace_jerid subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months!

[1:07:26] <sindegra> @talisign noooooooooooooooooooo
[1:07:28] <rovilm> this is the true experience of being a VAMPIRE
[1:07:30] <T_Sasquatch> did this game just turn into doom ?
[1:07:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sindegra He's actually in Chinese sewers right now. The Earth's core is a lie, just sewers all the way down.
[1:07:31] <DracaenaLeaf> not even miniboss
[1:07:34] <Chester_goes_Berserk> @solidusrex I think he's here but can only be saved on plus patch
[1:07:35] <+TheWallOfMeat> Considering there's only so many rats down here, is blood a consumable item now?
[1:07:37] <+NPCMatro> chalice

[1:09:15] <%AncelDeLambert> has an infinite blood source, uses finite one
[1:09:16] <yigs_kitchen_sink> there's more rats running around too

[1:10:54] <MyDarkStorm> Im Loving the Blade 2 Dying Effect from the Enemies
[1:10:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It was a Nosferatu that was using Celerity so he could run super fast.
[1:10:55] <+Chocolatevgz> poik*
[1:10:55] <+IrishWeegee> those guys were shooting quan chi skulls at you

[1:10:59] <rovilm> nice Nickelodean sound effect there
[1:11:00] <%OldOnyx> nos running in and getting their ass dusted
[1:11:01] <mr_slaide> GUN
[1:11:04] <waj9876> @Deekman Absorbs some damage until you take a certain amount or turn it off manually.
[1:11:06] <Duelahan> Was that thing firing Quan Chi skulls?
[1:11:08] <$madhattergay> corpsebodyboy
[1:11:11] <%gespenst25> Nice of him to wait
[1:11:12] <MrNoobMcSalt> the power of GUN
[1:11:13] <%TheKillerKalamari> tiny ribcage
[1:11:13] <Sloavon> ???????
[1:11:16] <KeystoneA1> These things kind of look like the Fat Cenobite from Hellraiser
[1:11:24] <rovilm> Kirsty........
[1:11:24] <BunnyEmperor> Fat DOOM zombies
[1:11:24] <misterbackdown> fires one shell, changes magazine
[1:11:25] <Sterawlings> chalice doesn't work well against vamps
[1:11:26] <LtSergei> did he pick up the key?
[1:11:26] <Badgerconda_> it only fills up when you do melee or unarmed combat I believe. Not from discipline or ranged.
[1:11:27] <+TheWallOfMeat> last time you killed like a billion zombies for it
[1:11:27] <%maybefalco> no monster stands up to the power of GUN
[1:11:27] <%slimcinnamo> slimcinnamo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Love ya
[1:11:30] <%DSD24> I reload after every kill
[1:11:31] <Deekman> @waj9876 thanks!
[1:11:33] <+Rakenshin> Your petty supernatural shit is no match for my GUN
[1:11:33] <LtSergei> oh yeah, good
[1:11:34] <starotter70> @LtSergei Yes
[1:11:36] <mrgrimsmiles> more you kill the quicker it fills
[1:11:40] <$madhattergay> dat stock splat sound *chefs kiss*
[1:11:42] <waj9876> @LtSergei He did I think.
[1:11:42] <CrabSlacks> you need to kill lottsa dudes to fill up the chalice
[1:11:42] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh no, I'm late!
[1:11:47] <LtSergei> that will save a lot of time
[1:11:49] <@Pandora_Prime> half the stuff down here you can just stealth past
[1:11:49] <%Kavtech> That card never spawned for me.
[1:11:50] <Sterawlings> go down
[1:11:54] <rovilm> Hi @JenovasPuppet
[1:11:54] <%Bupkis7> Wrong way
[1:11:58] <%PaladinDupre> Pat would hate the reload mechanic in Rising Storm, you have a set number of mags and when you reload it keeps the partially used mag as a partially used mag.
[1:11:58] <waj9876> My first time playing this I never got the key.
[1:12:01] <%Caitiri> other way
[1:12:01] <+TheWallOfMeat> I just used celerity and ran past everything tbh
[1:12:03] <%korth367> doesnt help when everything looks the fucking same too
[1:12:03] <+nicktheray> WHAT'S THAT SMELL
[1:12:04] <rovilm> high octane gameplay
[1:12:04] <Sterawlings> whenever you can go down
[1:12:05] <RupanSen> you're pretty much done with this
[1:12:05] <count_bob> Honk
[1:12:09] <MyDarkStorm> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:12:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat do the big shooty
[1:12:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @nicktheray its the sewers
[1:12:19] <%DSD24> I like how Condemed did reloading
[1:12:19] <artistdavidharper> IS BLOOD!
[1:12:20] <waj9876> The worst is basically over.
[1:12:20] <+BoomerTiro> @PaladinDupre That sounds FANTASTIC
[1:12:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Use big cheats, there’s no shame
[1:12:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @paladindupre And I assume there's no ability to consolidate the rounds?
[1:12:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can probably do this section in 15 minutes with celerity
[1:12:37] <%PaladinDupre> @BoomerTiro Rising Storm 2 Vietnam is fantastic
[1:12:41] <%manwithboxonhead> @Sterawlings apatSmug
[1:12:44] <Conky89> Oh boy the sewers, The best thing ever.
[1:12:45] <LtSergei> good sound effects i guess
[1:12:45] <+TheWallOfMeat> wait you can shoot in third person?
[1:12:48] <dsauce999> PATYOT, why no play babbi gaem, why not schut gaem?
[1:12:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BIG DAMAGE
[1:12:48] <%MagickBurritoh> Boob physics were unnecessary for that enemy
[1:12:50] <%spiritofmojave> Look at that blood drain, jesus
[1:12:51] <%PaladinDupre> @GeneralSCPatton not without a resupply point
[1:12:52] <SomersaultJustice> more dong
[1:12:55] <CrabSlacks> need blood, must be fresh
[1:12:55] <%JenovasPuppet> JenovasPuppet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Aw yeah even grosserer eyeball
[1:12:56] <TheRagingLeo> this uhh...this segment is not good. ResidentSleeper
[1:12:58] <KeystoneA1> @PaladinDupre Seeing "The tank feels FULL" is the best feeling
[1:12:58] <%TheKillerKalamari> Escape from Tarkov has that mechanic, and if you drop a mag, the ammo is gone forever... mags are also actual items
[1:12:59] <%Deekman> Deekman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Getting closer to my 1 year badge. Thanks for keeping me sane through some really trying times
[1:13:00] <LtSergei> best thing you can say about the guns in this game i think
[1:13:00] <TReaperx1> @AngriestPat when is the yakuza ?
[1:13:00] <ミュウレ4242> he's a thamaturgy tremere. he doesn't need to cheat.
[1:13:01] <rovilm> That was unncessary.... but... thank you

[1:33:37] <%galaxyswirl> oh the jumping ZOMBIES!!!!
[1:33:37] <+InstiGaitan> ninja vampires!
[1:33:38] <%Niney_Who> Chinese Hopping Vampires ah
[1:33:38] <Atheistpreacher> Kuei-jin are such a cool plot line
[1:33:39] <takokasa> ancient chinese ghost army
[1:33:40] <%Mekhet09> It's actually Zimise
[1:33:40] <%Laecerelius> The hopping vampires?
[1:33:42] <alexandrecau> oh no the triad
[1:33:46] <%galaxyswirl> THEY ARE ZOMBIES
[1:33:46] <artistdavidharper> Nah.
[1:33:47] <+NPCMatro> yakuza vamps
[1:33:47] <BunnyEmperor> Pat gives himself the Final Death
[1:33:51] <%MightyMaxT> Okay, in this fiction, are there other monsters besides Vampires? Like fish-men or werewolves?
[1:33:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> No relation to Caine. Feed on chi.
[1:33:53] <televisedrevolting> Parappa the Rappa?
[1:33:54] <MyDarkStorm> He Dead
[1:33:59] <CrabSlacks> gotta go fight the red poles or some shit

[1:34:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mightymaxt You have no idea. World of Darkness has a lot of shit.
[1:34:17] <+MaddyCaddy> The Kuei Jin are pretty cool. They start off as zombies that have to eat rotting flesh for chi, then they can suck chi out of blood, and then eventually they can just suck it out of the air.
[1:34:17] <%Wrashis> triads for days
[1:34:17] <%DSD24> I liked the 3rd option

[1:35:10] <energywarning> blow the kuei-jin, got it
[1:35:11] <ミュウレ4242> chinatown is the best area.
[1:35:11] <Tsarwerewolf> Pat, what mods are you using to make this game playable?
[1:35:15] <+MaddyCaddy> Do the anime hunter girl side quest first

[1:35:43] <talisign> @outlawmap Sailor moons, in the fan game
[1:35:44] <+thebonebard> @Tsarwerewolf unofficial patch is the only one you need]
[1:35:47] <SparkAfterDark> My headcanon is that the world at large totally knows about vampires but they play along with the masquerade because literally every single vampire is such a fucking mellowdramatic edgelord that they'd rather just not have to deal with their bullshit
[1:35:48] <$konekoryugamine> Fuck all NOTHING
[1:35:49] <%Wrashis> @Tsarwerewolf aparently hes just using the GOG version which comes with the fan patch that makes it work good

[1:36:45] <%Chatterbox1991> Apparntly he also did Volgin in MGS3
[1:36:45] <DracaenaLeaf> it's not

[1:55:51] <+toilet_chan> this entire game is a bug
[1:55:52] <+Lyraniath> It's not a bug. They tell you you can use stuff only for lockpicking.
[1:55:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It is intentional.

[1:55:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's mentioned in the tutorial.
[1:56:01] <%Shikari21> it is very intentional
[1:56:04] <%Kavtech> It's specified in the tutorial.

[1:56:43] <outlawmap> It's the poster you get the password for the laptop that was in that
[1:56:45] <PhantaniumOG> was there at the start
[1:56:46] <KeystoneA1> Dodge
[1:56:46] <RupanSen> it was an Imalia poster
[1:56:46] <finalgrinder> early game there is an Imalia poster and Imalia is the password

[1:57:36] <xeros720> the answer is more gun
[1:57:37] <LtSergei> like google
[1:57:37] <KeystoneA1> you can, just look up the password
[1:57:42] <LtSergei> or twitch chat
[1:57:44] <SnaKemuho> doesn't Auspex buff hacking
[1:57:45] <aazv17> Guns are good
[1:57:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> We could just give him the password that's true.
[1:57:47] <%Mekhet09> Get some charisma.
[1:57:49] <%SolidusRex> You can, look at the twitch chat.
[1:57:50] <outlawmap> You also want persuasion at 9
[1:57:51] <rovilm> SOAK
[1:57:52] <%spiritofmojave> Whenever gun isn't on screen people should be asking WHERE GUN
[1:57:53] <aazv17> late game they are OP as hell

[2:05:13] <%Laecerelius> Why didn't he grow back?
[2:05:14] <%spiritofmojave> It's NOT GROWING
[2:05:14] <energywarning> you must nurture your humans orthey won't grow back
[2:05:14] <$TheKillerKalamari> The succ too stronk
[2:05:14] <+Lyraniath> Lots of cops/security don't seem to grow back. Happens with a guy in a haven on another pathline too.
[2:05:15] <waj9876> @valkuma But they do though.
[2:05:17] <Zombrocom> People don't just grow blood in a few hours man
[2:05:18] <TwinBat> he has a condition
[2:05:19] <overlordkog> fuck the police
[2:05:20] <RickyRelucent> Oh look, its the stop sign you can speak to as a malk
[2:05:22] <+Doppio1089> Mind goblins?
[2:05:24] <Badgerconda_> He's not a generic NPC.
[2:05:24] <%valkuma> waj9876 intended-to-suck ones do
[2:05:26] <+TypicalAnomaly> gachiBASS
[2:05:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Any "enemy" NPC doesn't regain health.
[2:05:27] <StromkoPenguin> Some NPCs do regen, Fitzpatrick at the bail bonds place for instance
[2:05:28] <linkinbird> “Why didn’t he grow back?”
[2:05:30] <LtSergei> you could have just drank heather
[2:05:31] <+CaptainJax> people have INFINITE blood

[2:05:34] <+asgard147> HE CARED PAT
[2:05:34] <PsychicKirby> SUCC go up
[2:05:34] <%JenovasPuppet> Growing back succ takes time
[2:05:35] <a1u5> Ghoul Paige is a ghoul, they grow back fast. He's a regular human
[2:05:36] <%manwithboxonhead> Its as though Humans have limitations Pat
[2:05:36] <+daisyyyy> Shouldnt lose humanity for killing a cop lol
[2:05:37] <rumuloh> Hemophiliac @AngriestPat
[2:05:38] <takiyami> He's not as strong as the bail bonds guy, I guess
[2:05:38] <televisedrevolting> He has hemophilia or whatever the hell.
[2:05:38] <Marpolo13> lol
[2:05:42] <+Lyraniath> Pat you're ruining the economy free sucking a hooker.

[2:05:47] <%snow_bush> Taking it like a champ
[2:05:47] <SnaKemuho> just imagine that every generic NPC is a different person and cops are the same
[2:05:48] <takokasa> no fucks given
[2:05:48] <Conky89> Maybe because they are technically combat NPCs they cannot regain their blood back.
[2:05:49] <%kitkat668> just stood there and took it
[2:05:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Pat guys can’t handle two succs in one day

[2:06:00] <%FoulNightingale> She's used to it
[2:06:00] <%king_wragles> @Badgerconda_ he sucked on the bounty hunter guy a bunch of times. I think it's because cops can engage /fight
[2:06:01] <starotter70> Not even paying
[2:06:01] <hntronium> the popo are coming for yo
[2:06:02] <KeystoneA1> She gives and takes the SUCC like a champ

[2:06:20] <depressedpepega> that's basically theft
[2:06:22] <waj9876> Is the Venus money every quest, or every major quest?
[2:06:22] <Sterawlings> you need to go into the sewers
[2:06:25] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hey pat why isn't this town overrun with vampire hookers if you keep biting them?
[2:06:26] <GalaxyCrusher> yes, leave her i like that, i find the unironic look is better than underwear and redhead wig. the latter is worthless but the former is funny
[2:06:27] <rovilm> was scared the door was going to fail there
[2:06:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to sneak into the theater through the sewers.
[2:06:29] <mr_slaide> Pat, as a guy who has done some biology class, erythropoiesis takes longer than that.
[2:06:30] <NeroInfinite> You almost did it again pat

[2:07:21] <+ShadowArcangel> LUL
[2:07:22] <mr_slaide> Yes. Yes you are.
[2:07:24] <$TheKillerKalamari> I like how the hotel security has cameras inside residents bathrooms
[2:07:25] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> you can send them into castlesuperbeastmail@***

[2:07:29] <Sterawlings> sewers
[2:07:31] <LtSergei> there's the theatre here
[2:07:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pats a trap
[2:07:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Do the theater quest now since it's here.
[2:07:34] <+Spec7re> That box tried to eat your leg you should destroy it
[2:07:41] <waj9876> @TheKillerKalamari They're specifically spying on them for sex stuff.
[2:07:45] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@emperri) (warning)
[2:07:52] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Ion_Laser ...nosferatu lady? ...ew.

[2:08:22] <%snow_bush> Being a vampire is much like the rest of life. Disappointing.
[2:08:25] <televisedrevolting> @starotter70 And it might sound a little something... like this.
[2:08:26] <%mr_macho_muchacho> Do you have the camera?
[2:08:28] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> was mine visible?
[2:08:29] <Ion_Laser> @Youwereeatenbyalid yeah. she looked like a mess :D
[2:08:33] <Tsarwerewolf> These are some Half Lifer 2 sewers
[2:08:37] <%mr_macho_muchacho> You loaded your game, and may not have picked up the camera from you mailbox

[2:08:50] <%Shikari21> @snow_bush and its like disappointing forever too which is even worse tbh
[2:08:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Because if so, moobot busted the people being sneaky, but let me just deadass post an email in chat
[2:08:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That map is for Nosferatu's to fast travel to other areas.

[2:18:41] <SparkAfterDark> This gives credence to my theory that regular humans know all about vampires and they just play along with the masquerade because they don't want to deal with you mellowdramtic edgelords if they don't have to
[2:18:41] <starotter70> Are those guards related to Paige?
[2:18:43] <%mr_macho_muchacho> "Oh there goes that retarded bot that thinks hes a vampire. I'll play along to be nice."
[2:18:44] <+Mottyrob> The Poopsquerade: Sewerlines
[2:18:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> jank is the strongest power
[2:18:46] <Madbearv> @AngriestPat You gotta remember that this game was rushed as fuck
[2:18:48] <Tsarwerewolf> Damn, Dracula ain't got shit on that? Motherfuckers turning into bats n shit?
[2:18:56] <a1u5> Der goes dat Pat~!
[2:19:07] <HorribleHog> would be hilarious if when intimidation was maxed you could be shit at sneaking but people would ignore you for their sanity
[2:19:11] <TwinBat> thanks to activision
[2:19:12] <buffmurffy> we'll tell you three times
[2:19:13] <a1u5> No Pat... you don't know... YOU DON'T KNOW!!!!!!
[2:19:13] <starotter70> And it's better for it
[2:19:13] <natebud> Stealth is proximity based LUL
[2:19:15] <%valkuma> Rushed as fuck and still amazing as fuck.
[2:19:19] <%Solidnick18> looks rushed
[2:19:19] <@lewdskeletor13> @elmoseevee You become a vampire. You choose what kind of clan you wanna be a part of and have to navigate the politics of the Vampire government. The Masquerade is the rules that keep Vampire hidden from humans. Breaking the Masquerade enough times results in failure
[2:19:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> are there any games that wern't rushed tho LUL
[2:19:24] <RickyRelucent> Lets hope the second one lives up to the hype
[2:19:25] <%Shikari21> hopefully 2 is not as rushed
[2:19:26] <%NWR_James> "Excuse me sir" "Go fuck yourself"
[2:19:26] <Madbearv> Yea, its a really really good game
[2:19:27] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[2:19:28] <LtSergei> it's not even rushed, they had plenty of time to fix it because HL2 got delayed. Activision just wouldn't let them do any more
[2:19:28] <Conky89> It wasn't so much rushed as fuck as it was more so a fucking bitch to program.
[2:19:33] <%Mornaka> grumblecat
[2:19:34] <%El_Desperad0> @DesuDesuDokiDoki dmc5
[2:19:37] <Tsarwerewolf> @DesuDesuDokiDoki our old friend Duke Nukem forever
[2:19:39] <Badgerconda_> The fact that they had to crunch it becomes more obvious the closer you get to the ending, unfortunately. Early on it's great, and then the cracks start showing... it's still got some awesome stuff late game, though.
[2:19:40] <Madbearv> I think 2 has been in dev for at least 2-3 years
[2:19:41] <a1u5> It came out on the same day as Half Life 2
[2:19:41] <Ner234> He growl
[2:19:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fair
[2:19:46] <+Disraged> the music is so fucked now

[2:20:29] <%Laecerelius> Isn't Elmo just a living pillow?

[2:25:02] <HorribleHog> the webcam also has very high stealth
[2:25:02] <%skizzuto> well if she didn't notice you she probably won't notice the camera
[2:25:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> B I G S N E E K
[2:25:03] <waj9876> She's not noticing you, and you're like at least five times it's size.
[2:25:05] <@lewdskeletor13> This is worse than Skyrim

[2:25:15] <ameraaaaaa> @angriestpat look at elmo he looks like a gargoyle
[2:25:16] <Badgerconda_> I feel like the patch made these missions -way- easier. I remember them being a lot harder.
[2:25:17] <theshillman> It. Just. Works.
[2:25:18] <SparkAfterDark> Pat how do you know there aren't cameras all over your house?
[2:25:19] <lemon_lore> magic?
[2:25:21] <LtSergei> computer
[2:25:22] <+Lyraniath> Your stealth is enough but auspex makes stealthin' easy.
[2:25:23] <energywarning> imma just walk around my home with a loaded handgun no biggie
[2:25:24] <Conky89> Should have put a few points into stealth if it made stealth this freaking easy.

[2:26:49] <SillyPhillyBilly> @SillyPhillyBilly is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[2:26:52] <overlordkog> mind goblin asmr
[2:26:58] <%TeraMercier> Soo... there's a menu option for the cameras on the people being snooped on? That they don't know the password to?

[2:27:11] <MoonObscure> elmo come back!
[2:27:11] <starotter70> BibleThump ELMO BibleThump
[2:27:12] <SkeletalApostle> NO!
[2:27:13] <Test_Subject_099> lol
[2:27:13] <InugamiTheHound> D:
[2:27:13] <$TheKillerKalamari> Don't mind me, I'm just putting these Logitech Webcams all over your house
[2:27:16] <grayjammer> BUT AT WHAT COST
[2:27:16] <+Disraged> what if Elmo was the Mind Goblins the entire time?
[2:27:17] <Khorneflakes_> We've been forsaken BibleThump
[2:27:17] <%Shikari21> NOOO :(
[2:27:18] <waj9876> @TeraMercier The Nos are hackers.
[2:27:18] <LtSergei> that dude walks around his house with a gun in his hand and takes a piss every 30 seconds
[2:27:18] <natebud> "Hey babe, did we buy three webcams?"
[2:27:22] <@lewdskeletor13> I never thought a game other than Skyrim would have such broken stealth
[2:27:23] <NewWaveMasquerade> Elmo Troll again!
[2:27:24] <icantstopthescreams> Pat could probably walk through the house with noise-makers taking a shit all through the house and no one would notice
[2:27:25] <%skizzuto> that's how cats be sometimes
[2:27:26] <+Epic_Skeptic> This is the weirdest game I have ever watched..
[2:27:27] <+Spec7re> Stream over elmo is gone
[2:27:28] <+BoomerTiro> No more elmo!? UNSUSBCRIBED
[2:27:29] <%Trtickster> They are entirely aware of the fact he's there, but I'm sure they figure it safer to just pretend the weird pale guy squatting through their home isn't there
[2:27:30] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Elmo can't believe that crazy shit either
[2:27:34] <cacophanes> get the Colt
[2:27:35] <Atheistpreacher> This was supposed to be a supper scripted walkthrrough but pat just broke it and walked right in
[2:27:35] <%Wrashis> pat just got elmowned
[2:27:37] <SparkAfterDark> If I saw this guy creeping around my house I'd probably just fucking ignore him until he left too
[2:27:37] <Tsarwerewolf> Elmo has to go save the universe!!
[2:27:39] <LtSergei> sneek
[2:27:39] <starotter70> Fuck this bit HARD
[2:27:40] <%MightyMaxT> The fickleness is the charm
[2:27:40] <CrabSlacks> Pat, when are you gonna buy a watch
[2:27:41] <RupanSen> you need hacking 8 for this one
[2:27:41] <Cardboard96> Oh shit LA
[2:27:44] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Wouldn't it suck if they chose to fuck on the table instead?
[2:27:49] <outlawmap> Stats please
[2:27:49] <waj9876> THIS mission was bullshit.
[2:27:50] <%MightyMaxT> You have to EARN their attention
[2:27:57] <waj9876> Watch Pat do it first try easy.
[2:27:59] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat, how long until either Elmo or Paige piss in the Gamer Cube?
[2:28:04] <symbiotknight> just got back from avengers what I miss
[2:28:05] <GalaxyCrusher> is the type of game where -10 stealth be like 10 stealth cuz maths and stuff
[2:28:09] <Marpolo13> oooo
[2:28:11] <+CrescentRubyRose> I think I need a hug after that last JoJo episode. cirPls
[2:28:11] <Cardboard96> Oh this...
[2:28:14] <%Wrashis> did you ever go back and delete half your saves or did you forget?
[2:28:15] <%TeraMercier> I'm really just curious about why they would put a camera interface option front facing the people being snooped on. Unless they removed that option via hacking immediately after you leave
[2:28:17] <%shabop> oh boy
[2:28:25] <%llamington> i smell it
[2:28:27] <LtSergei> up stairs
[2:28:36] <LtSergei> in the top office
[2:28:37] <outlawmap> That was literally the same camera room that is in the blood bank
[2:28:38] <starotter70> Paige?
[2:28:38] <+mrshazboto> Is that rock Anor Londo?
[2:28:40] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat It's in the control room, namely the locker
[2:28:40] <@commanderclaw> upstairs IIRC
[2:28:40] <natebud> kind of like a rock
[2:28:41] <+Afrobrawler> This sneaking actually has to be bugged
[2:28:42] <LtSergei> i think
[2:28:42] <Badgerconda_> i think it's in a safe in the office at the back.
[2:28:43] <%Kravedarknesss> @crescentrubyrose it's ok we're all proud of abbachio
[2:28:43] <%nofestu2> I get those mixed up all the time
[2:28:44] <$waltzqueen> its a rock
[2:28:45] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "Fuck you, gib porn"
[2:28:46] <%TeraMercier> Wow this stealth is atrocious god damn
[2:28:52] <@lewdskeletor13> Fe Fi Fo Fum, I smell some pornography
[2:28:53] <waj9876> There's no way this is legit sneaking what the fuck.
[2:28:55] <KeystoneA1> He forgot the key lol
[2:28:56] <Test_Subject_099> break window
[2:28:56] <CrabSlacks> just break the window
[2:28:56] <a1u5> Use computer downstairs
[2:28:57] <LtSergei> oh, you need tyo unlock it with the computert
[2:28:59] <RupanSen> pc from before
[2:29:00] <%mr_macho_muchacho> First PC unlocks the door
[2:29:00] <natebud> break the window quietly?
[2:29:04] <Atheistpreacher> Sneaking must be bugged, it was bad, but never this bad.
[2:29:06] <+Epic_Skeptic> woolieS woolieT woolieF woolieU
[2:29:19] <+emperri> shitfinity
[2:29:24] <+ShadowArcangel> Rock on!

[2:29:26] <+ArcLifth> rock on!
[2:29:27] <Tsarwerewolf> So seriously what the fuck is up with the vampire porn and voyeuristic shit, I'm so confused
[2:29:27] <%TeraMercier> I mean if the stealth was busted hard before, then this would be an improvement
[2:29:28] <inz0mbiac> rock on!
[2:29:29] <RupanSen> in the plus patch is much less forgiving
[2:29:31] <%nofestu2> Dick armor
[2:29:33] <%Shikari21> yeah my sneaking was the same level as yours and it never worked that well for me
[2:29:39] <+PenmanLupine> this is like the reverse of Dead Money
[2:29:39] <Cardboard96> I tried to no clip into the safe once but the item won't spawn if you do that
[2:29:41] <+cbb88dragonborn> Rock on!
[2:29:41] <$TheKillerKalamari> one extreme to the next

[2:30:11] <%nikoloas_> auspex

[2:31:39] <Sloavon> level 100 skyrim sneak
[2:31:41] <energywarning> ew physical media
[2:31:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pff
[2:31:43] <starotter70> Why does this always happen!?
[2:31:46] <CrabSlacks> anyone remember zip disks
[2:31:47] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> haha its like the cd is old I het it
[2:31:47] <overlordkog> beta max
[2:31:48] <ameraaaaaa> stealthy jump
[2:31:48] <starotter70> How!?
[2:31:49] <Tsarwerewolf> @crimsonharvest and a good one at that
[2:31:49] <$TheKillerKalamari> They had you steal an AOL installation disc
[2:31:49] <%snow_bush> Back in my day you had to rewind the CD in a machine
[2:31:51] <InugamiTheHound> yeah video games are on CD-ROMS a blu-ray is updated version of one that is better
[2:31:51] <%nmaten> cds arent even that old you goons
[2:31:53] <natebud> Gary was using the stealth patch this whole time.
[2:31:55] <%Edgy_Macaroon> what is this CD
[2:32:00] <%PlumpPotatoRump> i remember Flappt Roms
[2:32:01] <waj9876> ROMs like what emulators use? Aren't those like totes illegal?
[2:32:03] <a1u5> CD for porn
[2:32:04] <%nmaten> i just bought one a week ago
[2:32:04] <buffmurffy> cd-rom? is that what a phonograph plays?
[2:32:07] <overlordkog> just use the shortcut
[2:32:11] <RupanSen> it's nice of them to employ blind people
[2:32:15] <%Deekman> I would love to see Paige play boxboy on switch. The puzzles are so simple in the first few worlds it would be great funzies
[2:32:17] <rovilm> I dont want to get into trouble for flashing my computer with this CD-ROM
[2:32:23] <%spiritofmojave> It's in the crypt with the purple light
[2:32:27] <RickyRelucent> God, vinyl needs to make a comeback
[2:32:34] <%PaladinDupre> Ststtttttstsep
[2:32:38] <Tsarwerewolf> It has in my city
[2:32:39] <@lewdskeletor13> Is a CD some kind of disease?
[2:32:42] <starotter70> Same length as any other side quest
[2:32:45] <Frostydough> CD-ROM THE Vacous SPider
[2:32:45] <+RushUnplugged> just ship games on vynil-rom disks
[2:32:47] <Tsarwerewolf> We have quite a few record stores
[2:32:48] <natebud> beta max needs to make a comeback
[2:32:49] <outlawmap> Vinyl already did and went away again
[2:32:50] <TeefTwo> @RickyRelucent thought it did
[2:32:52] <%TeraMercier> Doesn't CD ROM refer to read only memory? Is an emulator's ROM different acronym?
[2:32:56] <%SolidusRex> It's especially annoying to use this shortcut if you need to do Imalia's porn mag sidequest.
[2:32:56] <waj9876> Why are all of the computers in this game so FAT?
[2:32:59] <12gagerager> @rickyrelucent as far as i know it has.
[2:33:00] <rovilm> Do I put the vinyl into the computer?
[2:33:17] <InugamiTheHound> bring back cassette tapes
[2:33:18] <DracaenaLeaf> stop making me feel old
[2:33:19] <+cvp5127> OLD
[2:33:19] <Badgerconda_> Jesus, at the chillins in here.

[2:40:25] <Ion_Laser> DAT AWP
[2:40:25] <Ner234> MURDER
[2:40:25] <KeystoneA1> It's rapid fire
[2:40:26] <%Shikari21> ITS HIIIIGH MIDNIGHT
[2:40:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Revolver Patulot strikes again!
[2:40:27] <artoflec> D:
[2:40:28] <DraxTD> kill them all Pat
[2:40:28] <%PaladinDupre> YOU DON't FAN A DOUBLE ACTION REVOLVER
[2:40:29] <%castcode> D:
[2:40:30] <Badgerconda_> hold it down pat.
[2:40:30] <%TeraMercier> It shoots waaay faster
[2:40:35] <starotter70> Fastest homicide in the west
[2:40:35] <$TheKillerKalamari> civilians die real good
[2:40:35] <@lewdskeletor13> That kills people Carl!
[2:40:37] <%Mekhet09> Use Auspex.
[2:40:37] <RupanSen> does more damage and fires faster
[2:40:38] <NeroInfinite> hold it down pat
[2:40:38] <Sloavon> HOLD ON
[2:40:39] <@Pandora_Prime> apatBig Mcree
[2:40:39] <%spiritofmojave> EXHILARATING RELOAD
[2:40:41] <$TheKillerKalamari> police not so much
[2:40:42] <Ion_Laser> HOLD ON
[2:40:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> hold it down
[2:40:49] <$TheKillerKalamari> it's faster but not as accurate
[2:40:50] <%starkandstag> BIG IRON
[2:40:52] <%MagickBurritoh> HOLD IT
[2:40:53] <%Chatterbox1991> TAB
[2:40:55] <%TeraMercier> It's not really necessary for small targets since you'll be taking your time to aim anyway
[2:40:55] <InugamiTheHound> fanning your revolver makes you shoot faster and you have the speed loader as well.
[2:40:56] <+RushUnplugged> fan kinda sucks iirc
[2:41:00] <%Roasted_Pheasant> I do believe this is breaking masquerade.
[2:41:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> REVOLVER SUXALOT
[2:41:06] <%MagickBurritoh> it's much faster
[2:41:10] <Cardboard96> Cowboy style
[2:41:10] <RupanSen> or maybe does more damage only in the plus patch
[2:41:11] <natebud> Good for a big target
[2:41:12] <+Tokanova> it's faster
[2:41:12] <Sterawlings> big iron
[2:41:13] <outlawmap> Use it as a shotgun
[2:41:13] <%Mekhet09> It's a lot faster.
[2:41:13] <Badgerconda_> it's not super practical but it's great if you get up close to a big nasty.
[2:41:14] <rovilm> I don't think so
[2:41:14] <a1u5> It' faster, believe me
[2:41:15] <LtSergei> whats wrong with pat
[2:41:16] <%Shikari21> what its way faster
[2:41:16] <%colouroftheiris77> GUN IS BAD
[2:41:16] <%Mekhet09> And it does mre damage.
[2:41:17] <%spiritofmojave> The speed is much faster
[2:41:18] <%PaladinDupre> YOU DO NOT FAN A DOUBLE ACTiON REVOLVER THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS
[2:41:18] <Dehlome> good for close combat
[2:41:19] <%shabop> lie=ke 2x as fast
[2:41:19] <%MagickBurritoh> You have a gun OUT
[2:41:19] <icantstopthescreams> Vampire the mass shooting
[2:41:19] <+ShadowArcangel> you can basically use it as a shotgun up close
[2:41:20] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it's measurably faster, but accuracy takes a huge drop
[2:41:20] <NeroInfinite> It's good for oneshotting weakshits
[2:41:21] <$TheKillerKalamari> you're holding a gun out
[2:41:21] <+RushUnplugged> single shots are where it's at, it gud gun
[2:41:24] <%Deekman> do a meow and wave your fingers
[2:41:25] <%Bupkis7> This isn't breaking the masqurade
[2:41:29] <Fien111> Why are you fanning a double-action?
[2:41:32] <count_bob> Sniper rifle as an alt fire as well. @AngriestPat
[2:41:33] <%TeraMercier> @PaladinDupre Isn't it an option, just not necessary?
[2:41:36] <12gagerager> Anaconda good for poke.
[2:41:44] <InugamiTheHound> six bullets enough to kill anything that moves-Ocelot
[2:41:45] <hntronium> BITEZ ZA DUSTO
[2:41:45] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Footsies
[2:41:47] <%Deekman> YA YA YA YA YA
[2:41:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its cool to do
[2:41:52] <rovilm> All I know is penis fanning
[2:41:52] <Dehlome> you can fan a DA/SA revolver
[2:41:55] <%PaladinDupre> @TeraMercier no it literally doesnt work like that
[2:41:55] <%crimsonharvest> @Bupkis7 in america a psycho going nuts and murdering his neighborhood is just a weekday
[2:41:58] <LtSergei> oh yeah, jamie sue has a scope
[2:42:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anyone else want to see him dance for humanity?
[2:42:01] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I'd rather shoot slower but accurately than fast and loose. Especially if the ammo is expensive
[2:42:07] <kirijotakeharu> Is it just me or is the crosshair weird? Like it looks rotated slightly clockwise
[2:42:07] <arcaderabbit48> @Bupkis7 He's killing people, but he isn't drinking anyone's blood or using magic to do it
[2:42:11] <Fien111> @Dehlome you can....but why?
[2:42:12] <%mh9s> it's awful!
[2:42:12] <RupanSen> it's shitty tho
[2:42:13] <%Wrashis> pat still getting elmowned
[2:42:14] <Sloavon> ??????????
[2:42:15] <%LozsCat> you can fan a double action, but why would you
[2:42:16] <%Shikari21> that is horrid
[2:42:17] <outlawmap> Yeah if you want it to jam
[2:42:17] <+RushUnplugged> you fan a double action for COOL POINTS like Revolver Ocelot does
[2:42:17] <$Valdorick> W-what is... but there's no scope!?
[2:42:18] <%PaladinDupre> @TeraMercier when you fan a single action revolver you're holding the trigger down
[2:42:18] <+daisyyyy> You can but you dont have to
[2:42:19] <+MaddyCaddy> Good for one boss fight
[2:42:19] <Badgerconda_> i think it's more stable if you crouch.
[2:42:19] <%Jetsfantasy> That's TOO good
[2:42:19] <icantstopthescreams> That person was floating
[2:42:20] <%spiritofmojave> It's 2004 'zoom in'
[2:42:21] <+thebonebard> that scope is real bad
[2:42:21] <simulationbard> Thar's bad
[2:42:22] <overlordkog> Tell Mercurio to get you a flamethrower. It's stupid overpowered.
[2:42:22] <+emperri> wouldn't fanning a double action be totally pointless after the first shot and only if you didn't cock it
[2:42:23] <energywarning> it's the HL2 zoom
[2:42:24] <rovilm> Vampire of Duty
[2:42:25] <starotter70> @AngriestPat You've talked about disgusting bathroom stuff before, do you know the horrors of boys dorm bathrooms?
[2:42:25] <Dehlome> @Fien111 why fan any revolver?
[2:42:27] <$TheKillerKalamari> shotgun with a 4x scope?
[2:42:28] <+MaddyCaddy> And only that one boss fight
[2:42:35] <InugamiTheHound> it doesn't have a rifle scope but yet it can scope in?
[2:42:37] <%crimsonharvest> THat's the same as the HL1 Crossbow zoom only shit
[2:42:41] <%king_wragles> @TheKillerKalamari that was the bolt action actually
[2:42:43] <waj9876> It's a sniper rifle without a scope, of course it's not gonna be good that long-range.
[2:42:44] <%snow_bush> Time for sleep. Night all
[2:42:44] <%PaladinDupre> @TeraMercier if you try fanning a double action you still have to work the trigger so it just makes it more complicated and less accurate
[2:42:45] <rovilm> can we look at the posters
[2:42:57] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Have they released any detail about the story of the sequel?
[2:42:59] <%JJCheeker> Elmo teasing apatWink
[2:43:02] <%Mornaka> What if you could fan a shotgun, that'd be neat
[2:43:02] <$Valdorick> Oh wait, I know... Vampire Vision - its because you're a vampire... but only with that gun, not with any other gun.
[2:43:05] <+daisyyyy> Nah cause when you fan you hold the trigger down
[2:43:18] <rovilm> Vampire powers make guns much stronger
[2:43:22] <jay521> @AngriestPat delete old emails 10 is the max
[2:43:30] <%Dungeon00X> The Pat Cube
[2:43:33] <+emperri> quan chi jinn
[2:43:41] <%TeraMercier> Doesn't manually pulling the hammer back allow for an easier trigger pull? Wouldn't you just be expending the energy to pull it back, essentially just wasting your time?
[2:43:47] <Fien111> @Dehlome with a single action it lets you fire quickly by holding the trigger down as it resets. With a double action you don't need to cock the hammer at all, pulling the trigger does that for you. It's literally pointless
[2:43:48] <DracaenaLeaf> it's the max the shows @jay521 but you can still see new ones
[2:43:50] <%SolidusRex> There is no max.
[2:43:50] <rovilm> 11
[2:43:58] <+ShadowArcangel> there is no max
[2:44:03] <starotter70> Aw yeeeeeah
[2:44:03] <count_bob> 3
[2:44:04] <DracaenaLeaf> that* not the
[2:44:08] <rovilm> When is he going to get the VV emails
[2:44:08] <%Bupkis7> There is no max
[2:44:10] <starotter70> Empty
[2:44:10] <%PaladinDupre> @TeraMercier yes you can manually cock the hammer but thats not the same as fanning it with your opposite hand
[2:44:10] <takiyami> What do you think this is, Deus Ex?
[2:44:11] <count_bob> Key pat.
[2:44:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There is no max emails
[2:44:14] <chop_chop_cefis> tape
[2:44:14] <count_bob> Key
[2:44:15] <Dehlome> @Fien111 I know, fanning a SA doesnt have any use in the real world anyways
[2:44:16] <+MaddyCaddy> Why does it say suckhead is his email name?
[2:44:17] <%SolidusRex> Do people actually believe there is a max?
[2:44:25] <+MaddyCaddy> My email always said my character name
[2:44:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @SolidusRex clearly
[2:44:31] <mankeyfigh> MIND GOBLINS defeated
[2:44:37] <%TeraMercier> Ah, it's really just an asinine amateur hour move
[2:44:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:44:48] <+Mittensbro> the goth change bug fucked up the porno quest line @AngriestPat
[2:44:49] <rovilm> We need the big porns
[2:44:50] <starotter70> Maybe cause the key was there?
[2:45:01] <flubber3d> did it reset when you reloaded?
[2:45:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Buy pornography at the pornography store
[2:45:09] <%PaladinDupre> @TeraMercier essentially yes. If you wanted to cock the hammer you'd just do it with your thumb like a normal person. if you want to fan, get a single action
[2:45:10] <Fien111> @Dehlome it's just a wierd double pointlessness. I mean this game is about vampires so it's the not the most unrealistic thing but it still irks me]
[2:45:13] <kingra> LUL
[2:45:13] <starotter70> What!?

[2:45:38] <flubber3d> @angriestpat You're missing a poster. put vhs tape in
[2:45:39] <%spiritofmojave> ????
[2:45:40] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> That's a podcast title and a half right there
[2:45:40] <rovilm> I am laughing
[2:45:42] <+Mittensbro> @AngriestPat When you changed your ghoul into a goth and you had to reload, it messed up the save so you hadn't finished the entire questline
[2:45:43] <+Zilla93> Run away porn
[2:45:44] <%Shikari21> that is a good podcast titale
[2:45:44] <Test_Subject_099> lol
[2:45:45] <+PenmanLupine> No, Pat, when you reloaded because you got stuck in the door, did it also roll back putting the tape in?
[2:45:45] <Badgerconda_> i don't think that CD is for the mailbox, pat.
[2:45:48] <waj9876> Might have to spawn an item?
[2:45:48] <gustavozxd> poster ran away
[2:45:51] <natebud> oh wait you still have the tape i think
[2:45:52] <starotter70> Did you not put one of the items in there after quickloading? @AngriestPat
[2:45:52] <%Wrashis> when you reloaded after the goth issue you never actually put the tape in @AngriestPat

[2:49:21] <rovilm> Ah neonate, I have noticed you plastering the walls of the pyramid with weird sex posters
[2:49:21] <Sterawlings> we're floppys before VHS?
[2:49:21] <natebud> 2004 was a different time
[2:49:22] <LtSergei> it's the LA that goths see
[2:49:22] <TheLordMaverick> sounds about right
[2:49:24] <+TheSaintJohn> this is the OTHER downtown LA

[2:49:45] <+Shaggnar> That's probably why the new one is getting set in seattle
[2:49:47] <natebud> LA is just one giant strip mall
[2:49:48] <GothicLoveBlood> LA has gotten bigger now they're more towers now
[2:49:48] <+mrshazboto> This looks EXACTLY like Boston
[2:49:51] <%SolidusRex> Everything is more evil in the World of Darkness
[2:49:56] <InugamiTheHound> VHS, cassette tapes, floppy disc, CD-rom, dvds, blu-rays
[2:49:56] <waj9876> Talk to Jack before you to go Chinatown.

[2:56:04] <InugamiTheHound> Chinese cop likes blades more than guns?
[2:56:04] <alexandrecau> like clearly a gun now
[2:56:05] <LtSergei> that was on

[2:56:07] <+dukenux> Forget it Pat, its Chinatown
[2:56:09] <%polyseif> he has a perfectly good gun why'd he pull out a knife
[2:56:11] <count_bob> Nope.
[2:56:11] <Conky89> Maybe the knife if roleplaying as a PC in a survival horror game and wants to save on ammo.
