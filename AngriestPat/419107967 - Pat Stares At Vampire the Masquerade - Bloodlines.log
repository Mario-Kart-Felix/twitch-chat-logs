There were some really powerful consumables that were rare (instant full limit break, heal whole party fully, buff stats by 70%). Some bosses or enemies could inflict the HUNGER status, which is like confusion, but instead of at least contributing by usin

[0:20:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> bleedpurple500 bonus50 Let me tell you about the Hearth Path of Thaumaturgy, which Strauss seems to have used. You can make small effects trigger when someone passes through an entryway in your haven. Know exactly where your belongings are, within your haven. Disorient anyone else that enters your haven, and make them forget what they find. Teleport between doorways in your haven. And speak to items in your haven about events that occurred there. Imagine getting busted because the rug snitched.

[0:23:52] <%Kirby_Sauce> bleedpurple500 bonus50 attacks, it makes one of your character eat a random item from your inventory. It made Natz (the mage) eat an item that gives full limit break and inflicts burns, WHEN SHE HAD A FULL LIMIT. So here's a case of "use powerful item or else risknit getting used POINTLESSLY" I did capture the boss that did it to me at least...

[0:41:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> bleedpurple500 bonus50 EBF (epic battle fantasy) is a series I cannot recommend enough. While the first 2 were essentially boss/enemy rushes, it grew into it's own at 3, where it became a full fledged RPG. As an indie game, it really shows it's love for the genre, and EBF1 just recently had it's 10 year anniversary. It's kinda a game I'd like to see Paige play. (I wonder how long it would take Paige to get the "Pervert" medal.)

[0:46:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> bleedpurple500 bonus50 due to the nature of it's gameplay and "story" you can pretty much start at 1, 3, or 5. But if it ever DOES get played on these channels, I'd recommend Paige start at 3, and if you absolutely NEED to see all the things, I'd say you'd be better suited to play 1 or 2 pat. (Also lets you fulfill that fantasy of killing the shit out of Goku over and over again, as a pseudo Virgil boss. (He comes back a few times, stronger each time, guess he's more of a "rival battle" in that

[1:28:58] <+CaptainJax> Congrats Pat you helped the one Hunter that's not a huge asshole
[1:28:58] <%OldOnyx> Nos are harder than Malks
[1:28:59] <+EdenOfLove> no?
[1:28:59] <mrgrimsmiles> no malkcivan were the easy ones
[1:29:00] <%thebetterbard> The previous episode isn't up
[1:29:00] <$Totally_not_toby> hard is nostferatu
[1:29:01] <DXLelouch24> Malkavian crazy chick
[1:29:01] <%ironshah> ew they are gross
[1:29:01] <simulationbard> Let Piage play what she wants
[1:29:02] <%snow_bush> No, that's Nosfuratue
[1:29:02] <+countgaculatv> It's not the hard one. It's the spoiler one.
[1:29:02] <%Typhaeon> There are so many Paiges in the game already though
[1:29:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Play it, Paige
[1:29:03] <%thebetterbard> guess I can'ty watch
[1:29:04] <NeroInfinite> oh no put it away pat
[1:29:04] <DracaenaLeaf> Nosfertu are the hard ones
[1:29:05] <flatty1000> hard mode is Nos
[1:29:07] <%Laecerelius> Paige needs the BIG AND STRONG vampires
[1:29:08] <%Faustgesicht> nah, let her be what she want
[1:29:09] <$Totally_not_toby> malks are pretty simple
[1:29:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Skaw_Lann) (warning)
[1:29:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> Retcon = Crazy Talk?
[1:29:11] <flubber3d> they're the spoiler race
[1:29:14] <adamisfruit> No it’s easy!
[1:29:15] <+Camail> they spoil the game for themselves
[1:29:15] <Polengoldur> MALKAVIANS MASTER RACE
[1:29:15] <starotter70> Malk have funny dialogue
[1:29:15] <count_bob> @AngriestPat Fun fact! That shark thing was a werewolf.
[1:29:16] <giogio346> this game is bad :(
[1:29:17] <%spiritofmojave> Malkavian just makes the story mode crazy and spoilery
[1:29:17] <timetraveller2000> Then I pull out my gun!
[1:29:17] <Navlock> Crazy idiots
[1:29:18] <Skaw_Lann> aw man
[1:29:19] <+dukenux> Don't start as malks, Paige
[1:29:20] <+ProfessorDetective052996> Naw, Nosforatu is are the hard one. Malk is the joke run.
[1:29:21] <%Sabre_Basilisk> Damn pat i want crazy talks true user to hold it down
[1:29:22] <%Ganerumo> they see the future
[1:29:22] <+dukenux> He's a NERD
[1:29:23] <Skaw_Lann> moobot just got me
[1:29:23] <%Cybermancer> Cybermancer subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:29:25] <DracaenaLeaf> Malkavians are second playthough clans
[1:29:25] <flatty1000> Malks are best played on your second playthrough
[1:29:28] <Mr_Strut> Pat is a canon Malkavian.
[1:29:28] <Animal_Farm4> They can see the future and shit too though
[1:29:29] <+JackMillerTime> for some reason i think paige will understand malkavians
[1:29:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> Inside their head. they talk to them they understand
[1:29:31] <$Tuskor13> I have the power of insanity
[1:29:31] <axelcezar> big power
[1:29:33] <%NWR_James> how is that a power?!
[1:29:33] <+countgaculatv> They constantly hear spoilers for Endgames.
[1:29:34] <takiyami> Voices that spoil everything
[1:29:35] <@commanderclaw> WHO'S TALKING!?
[1:29:35] <RupanSen> Paige should be Gangrel
[1:29:35] <+3InchMensch> Also, completely weird dialogue
[1:29:36] <TwinBat> pat hasn't played he doesn't know
[1:29:36] <DXLelouch24> Chat shut up or its gun time
[1:29:36] <Croetec> tjat
[1:29:36] <+crowciller> they're the goldbloods of vampires
[1:29:37] <evbites> do it
[1:29:37] <starotter70> You'll be fine
[1:29:38] <Thirtine> yep the Malkavian Madnes Network
[1:29:39] <+Strigiform> malkavians have unique reactions and text options for every single option in the game
[1:29:39] <%Laecerelius> Paige should chose the clan she wants
[1:29:39] <ShichiNoBushi> You can argue with a Stop sign.
[1:29:39] <InugamiTheHound> insanity shotgun
[1:29:39] <%stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Nosferatu is the hard one. Malkavian just changes the entire tone of the game.
[1:29:40] <Grandma_Amari> MIC WAS OFF
[1:29:40] <BoneofMalkav> The voices don't happen often
[1:29:40] <%Bupkis7> No, they're strongest power is to make other people crazy
[1:29:41] <simulationbard> Malkavians dialogue doesn't make much sense unless you've played through the game already
[1:29:42] <Mr_Rakjo> It Is
[1:29:43] <%templar010> WHOS ACTUALLY TALKING?
[1:29:43] <+dukenux> MIC ON
[1:29:43] <+Camail> it is
[1:29:44] <Ion_Laser> The mic is on
[1:29:44] <Soliloquy123> Malkavians fuck up your dialogue options so you don't know what you're saying
[1:29:44] <Skaw_Lann> the voices are also spoilers
[1:29:44] <natebud> Constant wind chimes
[1:29:45] <worldbrand> WHO'S TALKING: the masquerade
[1:29:46] <flatty1000> its not a constant voice - its just cryptic dialogue choices
[1:29:46] <RickyRelucent> They hear voices which may or may not help them, sounds like me IRL :c
[1:29:46] <+dukenux> now it is
[1:29:46] <%Sulliman34> its on the gain is fucked
[1:29:47] <+kraajkase> malkavians have the best dialogue options
[1:29:47] <%MagickBurritoh> EAT THE MIC
[1:29:47] <CalderGaming> it's on
[1:29:47] <axelcezar> ITS ENOUGH
[1:29:48] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat You only hear the voices every so often in game
[1:29:48] <%MidnightBurst12> malkavians is spoiler mode
[1:29:48] <Navlock> Now it's on
[1:29:48] <derekwst3> its on
[1:29:49] <Mr_Rakjo> @AngriestPat show paige damsel
[1:29:49] <SnaKemuho> that's not the deal, the crazy dialogue is
[1:29:50] <SparkAfterDark> WHO'S TALKING
[1:29:50] <morningmoondude> i thought she was in japan??
[1:29:51] <evbites> that would be the best
[1:29:51] <Grandma_Amari> Mic is definitely on
[1:29:51] <mrgrimsmiles> they have the best dialogue
[1:29:52] <Tucker0603> play a Gangrel and be a beast child
[1:29:53] <%Das_Bass> there's someone in my head but its not me
[1:29:53] <+Hokepoke> it is on
[1:29:53] <%spiritofmojave> EAT MIC
[1:29:54] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat tremere were just normal humans who stole the immortality out of a shit tier vampire, and then stole Elder blood from a real og. they are lying stealing dirtbags
[1:29:56] <%BayowolfTerra> Its on
[1:29:56] <%AuksMattin> its definitely on Paige
[1:29:57] <reiju_22> that sounded good
[1:29:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Not literal voices, in this game
[1:29:59] <+3InchMensch> it's on, but the gain is low
[1:29:59] <%GreasyDratini> we hear you
[1:30:00] <$OmegaWeltall> yep Page would DEFINATELY be a Malkavian LUL
[1:30:00] <Navlock> Succ the mic, Paige
[1:30:00] <takiyami> Like, they programmed endgame spoilers into the malkavian storyline. Way back in 2004
[1:30:01] <%valriot> its on
[1:30:02] <flatty1000> cryptic pseudo spoilery messages
[1:30:03] <aimlesshealer> Mic took Paige damage
[1:30:03] <+moondog_> PAIGE EAT MIC

[1:40:44] <%RiffRaff1138> Paige, if you can see this, Malk is super fun mode but it is NOT for first playthroughs, the game will NOT make sense.
[1:40:44] <%MonsieurHedge> fucking told you chat. eat itttttt
[1:40:46] <count_bob> @bread_assassin You pick your clan later.
[1:40:47] <Ion_Laser> @bread_assassin you will be able to pick your clan
[1:40:53] <flatty1000> you'd still be from a clan even if you're thinblood but probably not expressing the traits that much
[1:40:56] <deviljhojho94> This game had good character models for the day!
[1:40:58] <ithirstforfreddurst> eyes in VTMB are already detailed
[1:40:59] <+absolute_cagemony> The eyes are the window to the SUCC
[1:41:04] <%squidking96> @mr_rakjo which ones went extinct
[1:41:05] <DracaenaLeaf> Why would you download an eye mod?
[1:41:06] <flubber3d> technically a mod
[1:41:07] <tungstenviper> LIGHTING FX
[1:41:08] <%afronooch> it jank peach
[1:41:11] <flatty1000> if you're supposed to diablirise your way up the chain
[1:41:11] <King9k> This game had really good models and face animations for the time
[1:41:12] <%starkandstag> he has special eyes
[1:41:14] <%PharosOfLight> I'm wondering if you'll diablerize into your clan
[1:41:17] <captainthunderwolf> These faces are fuckin oddly detailed versus literally cubic, is what Paige is saying.
[1:41:18] <Ion_Laser> The Source Engine holds up really well
[1:41:23] <+CanonHusbando> this was pre half life 2

[2:30:42] <%OldOnyx> @AngriestPat you could do all that and more but all if will be gone once you sleep for the day and make the next night. Easier to start a burger chain with your infinite supply of only slightly decayed internal organs

[2:30:58] <RupanSen> the glock is kinda better than the uzi tho
[2:31:00] <TheScruffman> Does the Plus Patch add any new weapons?
[2:31:07] <%swordmanegill> Nope
[2:31:14] <natebud> Oh yeah, pat never used the glock either

[2:31:39] <ミュウレ4242> it has cool animations tho.
[2:31:42] <%mh9s> you don't have teh necessary melee skill for it
[2:31:43] <@commanderclaw> Katana is only good if you have high melee stat
[2:31:43] <ooblag> It's much better if you actually meet the melee requirement

[2:32:29] <%king_wragles> @RupanSen I think damage is more those the kilmaster, but it really doesn't matter if none of those shots actually hit anything

[2:59:14] <InugamiTheHound> Pat has become the next mass shooter inn america
[2:59:14] <+shadowace2400> humanity lost
[2:59:15] <%Promessa_EX> that's a fun gun
[2:59:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @TwitchingFrog WHAT? That's real?? That's absurd
[2:59:15] <%mr_whet_faartz> nope a steyr aug
[2:59:20] <StripesUltimateEdition> >humanity lost
[2:59:25] <mar_krow> Lol
[2:59:26] <%Das_Bass> give me a clip so i can do some damage
[2:59:27] <%king_wragles> @Mushball I am kinda sleepy, and I'm extra silly when I'm sleepy
[2:59:30] <ameraaaaaa> that brings a whole new meaning to fuck the police
[2:59:32] <+daisyyyy> The desert eagle is awful tho irl
[2:59:32] <natebud> Good thing he maxed out the quicksave skill
[2:59:34] <ooblag> It is
[2:59:37] <+MaddyCaddy> Take two for the extra ammo
[2:59:37] <%spiritofmojave> that's because it isn't as good
[2:59:39] <shlaggori> definitely better
[2:59:40] <+EdenOfLove> Deagle is good tho
[2:59:42] <mar_krow> Flamethrower
[2:59:43] <lilmac64> It fires more quickly and holds more rounds.
[2:59:43] <Mr_Rakjo> Muh anacunda
[2:59:44] <@commanderclaw> Bigger Magazine
[2:59:44] <+MaddyCaddy> I mean both the magnum and deagle
[2:59:45] <+Strigiform> Fire Rate
[2:59:45] <%Promessa_EX> deagle probably shoots and reloads faster
[2:59:46] <CurrySauseBandit> csgo though
[2:59:47] <SchroedingersFerret> It's not a Deagle brand Deagle
[2:59:47] <%Chatterbox1991> Faster Fire rate and better accuracy
[2:59:47] <ミュウレ4242> my anaconda gets. my anaconda gets.
[2:59:49] <+Insom62> If I cant see your hand i assume its on your dick
[2:59:49] <+EdenOfLove> Deagle has more rounds
[2:59:49] <%mh9s> more rounds
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:50] <Moon_Shank> Deagle is more accurate than the Annaconda
[2:59:50] <%El_Desperad0> Deagle sucks
[2:59:51] <+EdenOfLove> and fires faster
[2:59:53] <ooblag> Magazine and fire rate mean higher DPS
[2:59:53] <ameraaaaaa> KonCha hello everyone
[2:59:54] <DomunDomunDomun> deagle brand deagle
[2:59:54] <ZZCooldown> eagle is the best weapon in the game
[2:59:54] <%SolidusRex> Fire rate
[2:59:57] <Strider222> deagle is deagle tho
[2:59:57] <Mushball> @king_wragles I have Jagged Alliance 2 to thank for teaching me the nuances of 7.62 ammo types
[2:59:57] <Solidus_113> more bullet per gun
[3:00:00] <natebud> That don't make sense
[3:00:01] <starotter70> @ameraaaaaa Hey
[3:00:01] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat In the plus patch they actually clean the blood on the floor there LUL
[3:00:01] <+twohitgood> eagle has better capacity and fire rate
[3:00:04] <ooblag> Everyone. Everyone cares
[3:00:06] <InugamiTheHound> The Steyr Aug is from Austria and in America you can buy buy because it turned 40 years old
[3:00:08] <%ItsRatman> Pat wants big numbers.
[3:00:08] <buffmurffy> but the DPS pat
[3:00:08] <SparkAfterDark> it's less bullet per bullet
[3:00:10] <+MaddyCaddy> Need both for the stupid health pool of later bosses
[3:00:11] <NeroInfinite> The deagle just shoots and reloads faster but it's over all trash
[3:00:11] <RupanSen> I prefer revolvers myself
[3:00:13] <%Chatterbox1991> nooooooo paaaaaaaat
[3:00:14] <DracaenaLeaf> DPS mate
[3:00:15] <%Mornaka> means more damage per second
[3:00:15] <ameraaaaaa> hey @starotter70
[3:00:17] <+twohitgood> dps
[3:00:20] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@thackattack00) (warning)
[3:00:21] <+MaddyCaddy> I would strongly recommend going back for it
[3:00:22] <%Shadowtalon77> Firing faster means using more consumables
[3:00:23] <%Laecerelius> Pat's ability to number is bad
[3:00:23] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat fun fact anaconda is when sum ppl call their BIG shit
[3:00:24] <mar_krow> Flamethrower all vamps hate 10 things flames can do for you
[3:00:24] <InugamiTheHound> revolver ocelot would be proud of you pat
[3:00:26] <%spiritofmojave> Anaconda has more style points
[3:00:30] <%Reaped_Psyche> You said the same thing about the lasdt gun that you ended up loving.
[3:00:32] <TwitchingFrog> @Reizie_Etherealm Story goes that two boys, one French and the other German, had visions in which they were commanded by God to retake the holy land. They gained followers and marched off to Italy where merchants offered them passage to the Holy Land, but they were all sold into slavery instead.
[3:00:33] <Solidus_113> LUL
[3:00:33] <+Camail> the aug makes everything else irrelevant anyway
[3:00:34] <SomersaultJustice> what is dragon's dogma's framerate on switch?
[3:00:34] <Run44forrest> shut up gun nerds
[3:00:34] <ooblag> Ohhhhh, it was a goblin thing
[3:00:36] <waterstealer> INVENTOREY SPACE
[3:00:36] <+EdenOfLove> GET THE GOOD GUN
[3:00:38] <icantstopthescreams> Pat would take a cannon just for big damage
[3:00:39] <%Promessa_EX> looking cool masters more
[3:00:44] <%king_wragles> Is recoil a measurable stat in this game?
[3:00:48] <mankeyfigh> Ahahahahahah
[3:00:51] <mankeyfigh> F
[3:00:55] <SparkAfterDark> the deagle sucks. besides, 6 shots should be more than enough to kill anything that moves
[3:00:58] <%Laecerelius> You can get more money from bit titty goth bartender
[3:01:00] <%Kirijuo> I feel like the second someone said dps Pat changed his mind
[3:01:07] <lilmac64> w a t
[3:01:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Are there any big important purchases later?
[3:01:11] <starotter70> McLusty
[3:01:14] <ooblag> @AngriestPat You're coming to a point where caryying a bunch of redundant guns is going to be a good idea, because it means you hold more ammo
[3:01:15] <+EdenOfLove> BIG GUN
[3:01:16] <NeroInfinite> no money now
[3:01:16] <%swordmanegill> M C Lusty
[3:01:17] <+Camail> the aug scoped is OP
[3:01:17] <ameraaaaaa> fuck the rules I've got money!
[3:01:19] <%swordmanegill> Lusty
[3:01:22] <+EdenOfLove> BIG SHOOTS
[3:01:24] <ZZCooldown> not sure if getting the best gun in the game
[3:01:25] <%Promessa_EX> something about that mag and the cartriges is off
[3:01:25] <mar_krow> The gun at the store in Hollywood is good
[3:01:25] <%Sabre_Basilisk> McBroke
[3:01:27] <natebud> Does pat have the gun requirement for the deagle?
[3:01:28] <%NWR_James> bigttiygoth
[3:01:29] <Run44forrest> noooo the money
[3:01:29] <SparkAfterDark> dps go up but bullet value go down. It's literally less boolet per boolet
[3:01:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> bi gtiddy moth gf
[3:01:32] <%swordmanegill> Talk to Jack
[3:01:33] <+subdude_> @GeneralSCPatton Flamethrower is good.
[3:01:33] <%Remery_> Yay :)
[3:01:35] <+MaddyCaddy> Only the Flamethrower at endgame for gun
[3:01:39] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @TwitchingFrog At least they didn't get dismembered and mutilated in battle so that's not the worst that could happen I guess
[3:01:42] <lloyddboy> it looks like SHIT
[3:01:43] <%king_wragles> @natebud he's maxed on firearms, so yes?
[3:01:45] <starotter70> Now give your ghoul her fix
[3:01:46] <lilmac64> Go show Big Tiddy gof GF your McLusty.
[3:01:48] <Strider222> this thing looks bad
[3:01:52] <%king_wragles> JESUS
[3:01:52] <+MaddyCaddy> Pat won't be able to use the sword that does agg damage, unfortunately.
[3:01:54] <%spiritofmojave> D:

[3:02:09] <%gespenst25> big boom
[3:02:10] <natebud> @king_wragles firearms isn't the only thing that gives gun skill.
[3:02:10] <%Typhaeon> That accuracy though
[3:02:10] <ameraaaaaa> big titty goth bartender
[3:02:11] <Strider222> dat sound

[3:02:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> loud
[3:02:14] <%MagickBurritoh> Hand cannon
[3:02:14] <%Mornaka> apatDab
[3:02:15] <beatie_g> Nothing happened :)
[3:02:18] <+JenovasPuppet> That LAPD response time is totally unrealistic
[3:02:18] <SparkAfterDark> the police will NEVER help you
[3:02:18] <the_hexe> if god loves me why dont he give me a big tiddy goth gf NotLikeThis
[3:02:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> GUN IS MAGIC
[3:02:20] <%mh9s> gun is the most powerful magic
[3:02:20] <%NWR_James> G U N
[3:02:21] <energywarning> guns are a kind of magic
[3:02:21] <ooblag> GUNS are like magic
[3:02:22] <Lord_of_all_Edges> guns are cool
[3:02:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> GUN MAGE IS BESTO
[3:02:23] <%connos_livereview> GUN WIZARD
[3:02:23] <%spiritofmojave> >Mass murders, "This is okay" :)
[3:02:23] <starotter70> Guns fuck vampires up
[3:02:23] <aristomuse> ohshit PAIGE
[3:02:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> but Gun!
[3:02:24] <GalaxyCrusher> Does Jack have input at this point in the game?
[3:02:24] <+Noxybaru> who's talking
[3:02:25] <+shadowace2400> lost humanity
[3:02:27] <%Laecerelius> GUN iS BEST MAGIC PAIGE
[3:02:29] <+bubblebasspickles> drink some oj
[3:02:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Gun is stronger against other supernaturals
[3:02:31] <Rhinoprotoss> Who's talking?
[3:02:31] <%nofestu2> but GUN tho
[3:02:31] <yourliteraldog> guns are normal
[3:02:32] <%king_wragles> @natebud that's kinda why I had the question mark, I wasn't really sure
[3:02:33] <Nobosy287> Guns are his magic
[3:02:34] <SomersaultJustice> Press B for GUN
[3:02:35] <Patzzki217> and sometimes you have to abide by the masquerade
[3:02:36] <Mushball> gun is just as dangerous to supernaturals
[3:02:36] <%MagickBurritoh> G U N is just geomancy
[3:02:37] <+Squid5_> I cast Bullet
[3:02:37] <simulationbard> Gun mages are great
[3:02:37] <TheBlankAce> Guns are essentially magic
[3:02:40] <buffmurffy> just buy bloodbags if you want blood
[3:02:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> Gun-Mage
[3:02:41] <tungstenviper> WHO'S TALKING?!?!?!?
[3:02:41] <+Strigiform> I cast the spell bullet
[3:02:41] <@commanderclaw> Paige should play a Gangrel cause they get HUGE
[3:02:41] <Kiraklene> LUL
[3:02:41] <%Mornaka> It's true
[3:02:41] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Blood is extremely limited too
[3:02:42] <%RiffRaff1138> Vamp magic sometimes doesn't work on supernatural enemies
[3:02:42] <lloyddboy> I cast GUN
[3:02:43] <%ECRead> Paige, you scared the shit outta me
[3:02:43] <TwinBat> HIC
[3:02:43] <GothicLoveBlood> Can't blow the masquerade Paige
[3:02:43] <+daisyyyy> Guns dont violate tye masquerade
[3:02:44] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @AngriestPat Why does Blade carry....a blade? =|
[3:02:44] <+Camail> guns are good vs humans, melee is for vamps
[3:02:46] <beatie_g> think of it this way: imagine how strong you'd be with magic AND guns?
[3:02:46] <natebud> @king_wragles i know
[3:02:47] <yourliteraldog> magic is not distcreet
[3:02:49] <%Laecerelius> Pat needs to become a gun witch

[3:02:50] <RickyRelucent> The blood never goes all the way to the peen
[3:02:51] <xeros720> guns are an explosive middle finger to magic
[3:02:51] <%Slaardacity> tfw no bigtittygothgf
[3:02:51] <+MaddyCaddy> Technically, guns are magical devices made from the Techocracy in this universe @AngriestPat
[3:02:52] <mankeyfigh> Look at how quickly you merked all those innocent people
[3:02:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gun is the most basic part of any wizard's arsenal, just ask Dresden
[3:02:54] <Mushball> but there is some real bullshit magic out there
[3:02:55] <natebud> sometimes you can use magic to make the guns even better
[3:02:58] <%Divryne> Gunzaga.
[3:02:58] <symbiotknight> guns are just magic speed run
[3:02:59] <SparkAfterDark> pat just doesn't like "wasting" blood on magic because he has to stare at his blood gauge being less than full
[3:03:00] <ameraaaaaa> and then sometimes you don't have enough blood then you need a gun

[3:03:56] <lilmac64> It's also worth mentioning that the only reason that his magic is so good is because he's playing a Tremere, who are explicitly the "Mage Class" of the game. If he had been playing certain other clans, he would be gettting MUCH more mileage out of firearms and melee weapons.

[3:12:17] <mar_krow> Wanna doesn’t care
[3:12:24] <RickyRelucent> But how exactly does a younger vampire kill an older vampire? Isn't being stronger already and building your strenght more plausible?µ
[3:12:30] <@lewdskeletor13> Time to drink that sarcophagus juice
[3:12:31] <InugamiTheHound> so vampires made up religion to manipulate humans?

[3:13:10] <AlasterAngelo> Is this game racist against the Chinese?
[3:13:17] <Run44forrest> talk to hat girl
[3:13:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Slightly
[3:13:23] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah probably @AlasterAngelo
[3:13:29] <+Manjove> not really
[3:13:29] <mattdel92> The chinese are racist against this game
[3:13:33] <natebud> maybe. i don't remember
[3:13:34] <%JenovasPuppet> The Kui-jin are corrupting our youth with their aniemay
[3:13:36] <lilmac64> @simulationbard The man on the couch (Mercurio) And the Lone Wolf (Beckett). Yeah.
[3:13:37] <alexandrecau> chinese vampire are acceptable target
[3:13:38] <ooblag> @AngriestPat You never did actually go through Communist Paige's regular dialogue
[3:13:43] <rovilm> Let us tear some ass
[3:13:46] <InugamiTheHound> @AlasterAngelo maybe the Japanese have a hand in it?

[3:14:11] <+Zereaux> i wonder what like butt blood tastes like to vamps
[3:14:12] <rovilm> Time to eat some meatballs
[3:14:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @big_chugnus Perhaps, but I think I speak for most if not all of the fanbase when I say I'll take what I can get from them naturally and not ask for something they haven't given and probably won't give ever, if you know what I mean
[3:14:14] <icantstopthescreams> Big game for big racism
[3:14:20] <CptBritches> The game isn't saying Chinese people are bad, it's just saying that Vampires in that area have rocky relations with the Kuei-Jin
[3:14:21] <%kitkat668> butt blood eww
[3:14:23] <+Afrobrawler> guess it's more that the kuei jin are just a very tight group
[3:14:26] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Now for Italian racism

[3:43:19] <+Estuko> @yourliteraldog flash step
[3:43:19] <MakeshiftSurgeon> She fast traveled, like in GoT. Kappa
[3:43:20] <%Dementedpenguin> You know a way through the next part, but you cowered in fear in the last part? Sure....
[3:43:21] <lilmac64> OH! I actually didn't know that she had a role beyond that first room. I've never seen this.
[3:43:21] <%rdark_ksu> jaaank
[3:43:22] <+absolute_cagemony> yo this music is hype
[3:43:23] <%AncelDeLambert> look at those skulls, man
[3:43:23] <%Sycada> So who's ready for Subverse?
[3:43:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> She didn't know the inner circle was vampires huh
[3:43:24] <%Jetsfantasy> SourPls
[3:43:24] <%Kirijuo> Not danger music
[3:43:25] <DracaenaLeaf> there's a green exp booster other than the book
[3:43:25] <haisho> she broke
[3:43:26] <Atheistpreacher> Huh, i never got her down here, my game must have bugged
[3:43:26] <+MaddyCaddy> He got the book but missed Saulocept
[3:43:27] <rovilm> She wont tell you
[3:43:29] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Is the only reason people don't attach location next to their said info is to avoid spoiler?
[3:43:29] <%mh9s> shit's jank dog
[3:43:31] <takiyami> "We should be safe" she says over the combat music
[3:43:32] <RickyRelucent> Time for kung fu brothers!
[3:43:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> There is an XP Boosting artifact somewhere
[3:43:35] <+Mockisho> Is that a wall of skulls?
[3:43:36] <CptBritches> Don't worry about it
[3:43:37] <theshillman> ! AI AT RISK !
[3:43:37] <Lord_of_all_Edges> she doesn't want to spoil your experience
[3:43:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Does having HIV make you immune to the Embrace?
[3:43:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ...
[3:43:42] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL total accident
[3:43:43] <+MaddyCaddy> He already missed it, so whatever
[3:43:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yeah ok sure
[3:43:46] <@lewdskeletor13> “We should be safe here” as combat music plays
[3:43:50] <+BlockingDisabled> This looks like a DooM map.
[3:43:50] <GothicLoveBlood> 200iq PogChamp
[3:43:58] <%AncelDeLambert> this is super Doom
[3:44:00] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat, you look weirdly comfortable in the cube right now.
[3:44:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Go back for XP Booster artifact
[3:44:03] <lilmac64> @rumtumtugnutz It doesn't make you immune to the embrace. The Embrace will make you immune to the symptoms of HIV though.
[3:44:03] <%Tearonex> Can you believe this random dude is packing heat and A FUCKING KATANA!?
[3:44:07] <natebud> looks like Quake
[3:44:08] <mar_krow> I just jumped that when I did it
[3:44:10] <%Kirijuo> Man zombies are so much less threatening when you're already a vampire
[3:44:10] <%rdark_ksu> this is so unnecessary
[3:44:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh right
[3:44:12] <%logoth_> It looks like a Heretic map
[3:44:14] <rovilm> * camel noises *
[3:44:15] <+Andrizzleton> Painkiller AF
[3:44:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Source Engine
[3:44:15] <SparkAfterDark> The gun sway doesn't hurt either
[3:44:15] <$Slimshazbot> more like quake
[3:44:16] <ooblag> Quake*
[3:44:16] <Ion_Laser> where's the monster closet?
[3:44:20] <Youwereeatenbyalid> this is a videogame
[3:44:21] <%MagickBurritoh> Very quake
[3:44:23] <%PaladinDupre> Its not Brown enough to be Quake
[3:44:23] <rovilm> hit tab to get the automap
[3:44:29] <+Estuko> @Tearonex go to a animecon, pretty common
[3:44:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Heretic was just Fantasy Doom tho
[3:44:34] <KaliasTV> Are those upside down skull torches
[3:44:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Getting wolfenstein vibes actually
[3:44:39] <Radski5> This is the most videogame it's been in hours.
[3:44:42] <haisho> more Hexen/Heretic than Doom really
[3:44:42] <+MaddyCaddy> If the HIV lady gets embraced, she's going to be drained of all blood and die anyways, so she won't have HIV anymore
[3:44:45] <Chester_goes_Berserk> oh my god it is doom
[3:44:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Nice rhythm to this BGM tho
[3:44:51] <%Tearonex> @Estuko Lol, guess you're right

[3:44:55] <+Zerodyne90> babukuThink
[3:44:55] <%PaladinDupre> Return to Castle Wolfenstein
[3:45:05] <rovilm> Vampires can slurp HIV blood?
[3:45:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Dank corner mechancis
[3:45:12] <%Agami23> is THIS castle super beast?
[3:45:15] <lilmac64> I nearly forgot about the Alt Fire on the magnum. That shit is devastating at short range.
[3:45:16] <tungstenviper> @PaladinDupre exactly
[3:45:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's the secret robo hitler room!
[3:45:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> This IS castle super beast
[3:45:29] <Radski5> This IS castle super beast
[3:45:32] <+Th3SmartAlec> This game is changing as we play it
[3:45:32] <RickyRelucent> @rovilm did you miss the plaguebearer section of this game?
[3:45:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Also holy shit this quest is so buggy
[3:45:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Missed the artifact
[3:45:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> This is Podracing.
[3:45:38] <+absolute_cagemony> at this point Pat's character might as well be saying Duke Nukem quotes after exploding zombies
[3:45:40] <waterstealer> we truly are the castle super best
[3:45:44] <mar_krow> Wua
[3:45:45] <waterstealer> beast
[3:45:45] <+Estuko> @lilmac64 I feel like a whack on the head from that gun would also be devastating lmao

[3:53:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wow
[3:53:47] <CptBritches> Beckett so good
[3:53:49] <mattdel92> If i spill my coffee does that mean Ive been abducted???

[3:54:29] <+MaddyCaddy> The Society of Leopold are some for real hunters.
[3:54:32] <gustavozxd> Beckett is great
[3:54:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Are you actually Samuel Beckett?
[3:54:36] <%radda343> guess which of lacorix's minions gets to go get him
[3:54:43] <+Strigiform> I remember the next quest now o boy
[3:54:46] <lilmac64> It's like someone turned Smugness as a concept into a vampire.
[3:54:52] <Radski5> It's the vampire detective who's MADE of newspapers.
[3:54:56] <TwinBat> killing 4 jesus!
[3:55:01] <rovilm> Christians. Why did it have to be Christians
[3:55:01] <+MaddyCaddy> There's a cool trait they can get in the V20 hunter rulebook where they can get punches empowered by God or something and do agg damage.
[3:55:07] <%MagickBurritoh> OOZING WITH SASS
[3:55:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sick burn
[3:55:13] <$castcode> whew
[3:55:17] <%spiritofmojave> Beckett is both the coolest and sassiest
[3:55:17] <%MagickBurritoh> or sarcasm
[3:55:18] <@lewdskeletor13> Savage
[3:55:18] <@commanderclaw> Talk to Heather first
[3:55:18] <takiyami> M'yes
[3:55:20] <%Laecerelius> I don't like this vampire. His smug aura mocks me.
[3:55:27] <lilmac64> Look at this fedora tipping shmuck.
[3:55:27] <$saturnianocean> The smuggest anime girl
[3:55:29] <Mushball> 100% god is real in the world of darkness and I have reasons to suspect that Bach had some holy powers on him
[3:55:29] <Ominnous> This guy is more smarmy than LaCroix
[3:55:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @maddycaddy True Faith?
[3:55:34] <natebud> mmmmmyes
[3:55:45] <%spiritofmojave> NO EXPENSE
[3:55:54] <Kirbachev> That shit-eating grin LUL
[3:55:55] <mayorrev> hold up is this cam clarke?
[3:55:58] <%stabbityrabbit> Beckett is the best. How do I side with him? Fuck Nines and LaCroix.
[3:56:01] <ScreamingMeat> This guy is such a sarcastic asshole I love it
[3:56:02] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat sent a tweet for later.
[3:56:03] <$shurtal> i might hate this smug bastard more than the other smug bastard
[3:56:14] <%rdark_ksu> 2
[3:56:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> While he's a real smug person, Beckett's a pretty cool and trustworthy dude
[3:56:21] <@lewdskeletor13> I love this guy
[3:56:21] <Radski5> Vampire the Masquerade 2 begs to differ.
[3:56:22] <$serpenttucker> HMMM
[3:56:27] <Mushball> 3
[3:56:28] <takokasa> Beckett is an independent. He only cares about getting BIG knowledge
[3:56:30] <ミュウレ4242> becket is made of lore. you'll never run out.
[3:56:33] <ComancheNate> this guy is douchey in his poshness
[3:56:41] <12gagerager> Beckett amazing.
[3:56:42] <mar_krow> No one is more smarmy than la croix
[3:56:48] <CptBritches> I absolutely love everything Beckett says
[3:56:48] <+MaddyCaddy> @GeneralSCPatton Fist of God on p. 124 of the Hunters Hunted II
[3:56:49] <natebud> Beckett's only better because he's not blatantly lying to you at all times
[3:56:56] <joneworldbeater> @AngriestPat Think you'll finish the game tonight?
[3:57:01] <+MaddyCaddy> Doesn't even need points in true faith.
[3:57:02] <%SolidusRex> Did you ask him about himself?
[3:57:06] <ooblag> You met Becket when he was in wolf form. Remember, "You can trust the lone wolf and the man on the couch"
[3:57:06] <%FrustratedAF> i can't believe there's this whole ass vampire world and still people that don't know about it
[3:57:07] <TwinBat> not going to bed?
[3:57:11] <%connos_livereview> drink the sarchophagus juice
[3:57:12] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat It caps out at 10 Blood Points.
[3:57:14] <Ion_Laser> that sweet sweet Blud
[3:57:14] <Radski5> Well he's smarmy but he's also 100% correct.
[3:57:15] <+ShadowArcangel> Beckett knows he's being an ass and he loves it and that's what makes him cool
[3:57:17] <lilmac64> Also give Pisha her thing.
[3:57:19] <ミュウレ4242> y'all should snag a look at becket's journal before every copy in the world gets gobbled up.
[3:57:21] <whycantipostasguest> you get skillpoints if you ask him about himself
[3:57:22] <+Manjove> that is how a secret society works
[3:57:23] <+MaddyCaddy> You're really close to the end
[3:57:24] <%FrustratedAF> !uptime
[3:57:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 57m.
[3:57:25] <%Promessa_EX> can we stay up late?
[3:57:26] <+cafefunk> I love how blunt you are in these games
[3:57:26] <Nefarious_Niblet> you're pretty close
[3:57:27] <+EdenOfLove> Talk to your boys and girls
[3:57:28] <CalderGaming> that's the voice of deckard cain btw
[3:57:34] <%NWR_James> It's full of pancakes
[3:57:38] <%waj9876> I'm addicted to FFXIV thanks to you. Thanks.
[3:57:39] <haisho> @FrustratedAF To be fair, half of it is working really hard to stay hidden and the other half is killing or enslaving anyone who finds out
[3:57:40] <%SolidusRex> You could finish the game next time.
[3:57:42] <natebud> need research for that book
[3:57:43] <gustavozxd> you're quite far from the end, a couple of hours and one abysmal boss fight
[3:57:44] <Atheistpreacher> There's still a bit to go.
[3:57:48] <lloyddboy> no wao
[3:57:48] <$castcode> aw
[3:57:50] <CptBritches> WAO-
[3:57:59] <$castcode> rip wao
[3:58:01] <+subdude_> There's still at least another stream left maybe two.
[3:58:04] <ooblag> He's not that close to the end, there's still a BUNCH of combat dungeons
[3:58:05] <yourliteraldog> zambo lady
[3:58:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @whycantipostasguest Isn't it a free Scholarship? Or was that at the museum?
[3:58:09] <+ShadowArcangel> There's quite a bit to the end

[3:58:21] <%Laecerelius> Yeah
[3:58:25] <CptBritches> Yeah he fought the yokai
[3:58:25] <ミュウレ4242> fortune teller has a sidequesst in the plus pack i think.
[3:58:25] <Ion_Laser> @lilmac64 yeah
[3:58:25] <+MaddyCaddy> All that's left in the game is combat sections
[3:58:25] <%Laecerelius> He killed the street shark
[3:58:28] <Mushball> wereshork is kill
[3:58:32] <whycantipostasguest> i think it depends on what you pick next
[3:58:32] <yourliteraldog> you mean street shark
[3:58:42] <+Manjove> man, if only there was someone to do a Malkavian playthrough after their first one
[3:58:44] <rumuloh> @lilmac64 He did, but if he hadn't you would have spoiled it, so good job
[3:58:49] <Ion_Laser> Hi Major!

[3:58:56] <Mushball> coldly human
[3:58:58] <%Laecerelius> Bitch, you need to clean up
[3:59:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Of course she's broken, that's why you made her a ghoul in the first place
[3:59:02] <scoan> the boss....
[3:59:04] <ryderbootz> get this bitch a washcloth

[4:01:43] <dzdandcnfsd> she eats people
[4:01:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat she deserved it tho
[4:01:44] <SparkAfterDark> you didn't get xp but you did get an experience
[4:01:45] <Superblooms> Mortis
[4:01:46] <%MonsieurHedge> waste o' bullets
[4:01:47] <%DSD24> 6 Shots more than enough to kill anything that moves
[4:01:49] <mar_krow> Not worth
[4:01:50] <Mushball> you did get the benefit of knowing there is 1 less monster out there in the world
[4:01:51] <yourliteraldog> So dose pat tbh
[4:01:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aww kill tho ;-;
[4:01:53] <lilmac64> @ithirstforfreddurst Allow me to clarify, the flesh she eats doesn't need to be fresh, technically speaking. She doesn't have to KILL for it.
[4:01:54] <TwinBat> pat eats people
[4:01:56] <+MaddyCaddy> You get the satisfaction of removing the world of a cannibal
[4:01:57] <tinypouf> babby go to bed
[4:01:58] <flubber3d> he's a vampire who cares about people
[4:01:59] <+MaddyCaddy> That's something
[4:02:05] <ooblag> He drinks people, there's a difference
[4:02:05] <%Laecerelius> Pat doesn't care if she eats people. He's not people so he doesn't have to worry about it. Let the hunters deal with her.
[4:02:06] <%Rngiddion> If you are cursed to die unless you eat people then maybe you should just die
[4:02:08] <count_bob> Time for Chinatown sidequest.
[4:02:09] <nevertrustcheez> Pisha's too cool to murder
[4:02:10] <RupanSen> She kills to eat, she's no worse than humans
[4:02:15] <%JenovasPuppet> If you feed someone to a lion, then kill the lion, that doesn't make you a good person
[4:02:17] <CalderGaming> bye bye vampire motoko kusanagi
[4:02:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RupanSen except for the bit where she eats humans
[4:02:32] <lloyddboy> MASTER
[4:02:34] <CptBritches> Pat's character has a woman that is addicted to his blood that he keeps around to feed on. He's just as horrible as her
[4:02:36] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Bugged
[4:02:37] <%FrustratedAF> hoes PogChamp
[4:02:37] <+Estuko> did her breasts grow since we last see her
[4:02:37] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Just think of her as the overpopulation prevention girl
[4:02:38] <yourliteraldog> I mean pat owns a slave
[4:02:42] <mar_krow> She’s only worse cuz we humans don’t wanna be eaten
[4:02:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Broken?
[4:02:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Most likely
[4:02:45] <%Laecerelius> oh, well
[4:02:47] <DracaenaLeaf> Heather's good as dead
[4:02:50] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Ohhhh
[4:02:51] <ithirstforfreddurst> alright someone get Pat to do the boobie cheat
[4:02:53] <+SilasDrekken> theres probably a console command to fix her
[4:02:54] <yourliteraldog> There arre no heros here pat owns a slave
[4:02:56] <+subdude_> Wonder if you could fix it with the console.
[4:02:57] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh my god that did fix it last time didn't it
[4:02:57] <InugamiTheHound> mind fucked?
[4:02:59] <RupanSen> @Youwereeatenbyalid I miss the point
[4:03:04] <rovilm> Why won't you dump the body!
[4:03:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> What does he miss out on?
[4:03:06] <yourliteraldog> Look at her he broke jere
[4:03:07] <Atheistpreacher> @AngriestPat Heather did this in my run too, she fixes herself eventually
[4:03:08] <krymzen5> wha
[4:03:08] <%JenovasPuppet> The tits cheat is so bad
[4:03:15] <rovilm> There is a tits cheat?
[4:03:18] <+Estuko> ????

[4:03:20] <+MaddyCaddy> money
[4:03:22] <ithirstforfreddurst> @AngriestPat fix her by typing 'money 10' in console
[4:03:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RupanSen the point is don't kill innocent people because that's worse than killing animals
[4:03:27] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, there's a cheat to give all the women bigger tits
[4:03:27] <+MaddyCaddy> It make boob go up
[4:03:29] <mar_krow> Yes in console
[4:03:30] <krymzen5> i must see this cheat?
[4:03:33] <CptBritches> Lmao
[4:03:34] <%stabbityrabbit> Okay, why are people saying she had it coming? She literally has to eat to survive. It's just like Pat needing to drink blood.
[4:03:38] <takokasa> N E O N A T E

[4:05:04] <lilmac64> @TheScruffman Actually, yes. There's a lot of vampires who are not down with all this subterfuge and killing stuff. Sadly, they're few and far between, and don't often last long.

[4:07:37] <ooblag> This isn't even the bad shit yet
[4:07:38] <krymzen5> *switches chat to devil trigger*
[4:07:40] <Croetec> it has a strong ending
[4:07:40] <%stabbityrabbit> @MaddyCaddy Most of them don't know if Golconda is real. Not to mention just how difficult it actually is to attain. I'm not saying that vampires aren't dick, but it's more complicated than you make it sound.
[4:07:40] <mar_krow> It gets worse
[4:07:41] <KaliasTV> You're going to have a bad Friday
[4:07:42] <CptBritches> I think it goes down after Chinatown
[4:07:43] <RupanSen> I think it's fine
[4:07:44] <+Disraged> don't worry they'll have a 2nd try to ruin the game again ")
[4:07:44] <$Slimshazbot> Here's hoping for VTMB2 to not do that
[4:07:44] <Monkeyweed21> as is mandarin
[4:07:46] <mankeyfigh> He could choose the Camarilla, Anarchs, or himself
[4:07:46] <Ion_Laser> it sucks that the developers didn't get more time to work on this
[4:07:47] <lilmac64> @Youwereeatenbyalid Dealine go up.
[4:07:51] <+Afrobrawler> You aint seen nothing yet
[4:07:51] <+MrMcCrabby> can you tell this game was rushed out of development? Kappa
[4:07:51] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat got any examples of games with bad endings or quality going down?
[4:07:52] <Hal10k> You haven't hit Maximum Underbudget yet.
[4:07:55] <mar_krow> The headache
[4:07:55] <%Wrashis> but pat wouldnt you rather have the game end than have it trail off?
[4:07:57] <%ECRead> FFXV :)
[4:07:57] <%waj9876> The sewers were honestly the worst part.
[4:07:58] <SnaKemuho> the ending is good, everything else before it is blergh
[4:07:58] <%spiritofmojave> Strong ending, but yeah level design does kinda go down and it's depressing given how good everything else is
[4:08:01] <+Estuko> GO SEE JOHNNY CAGE PogChamp
[4:08:02] <CptBritches> Although I still like the game overall, there's still interesting writing near the end
[4:08:02] <+SilasDrekken> the final act aint great
[4:08:02] <YuongTiger> Almost like it's a "Chinese knockoff"

[4:08:41] <Croetec> Jericho had the worst ending I've ever experienced
[4:08:41] <%DSD24> Its also a shit game but it makes it worst
[4:08:41] <mar_krow> Mod saves the me3 ending kinda
[4:08:44] <%JenovasPuppet> At least Soul Reaver had a killer sequel. Defiance is the one that really hurts, because there's no followup.
[4:08:44] <%spiritofmojave> jermaOld
[4:08:45] <%Tearonex> Oh, wow
[4:08:46] <+ChrisAlgoo> but! we got soul reaver 2 because of it
[4:08:47] <LotS__> The ending is actually great if you pick the right one
[4:08:49] <%Jetsfantasy> The fuck is wrong with his head
[4:08:49] <Nefarious_Niblet> oh boy
[4:08:50] <$saturnianocean> jermaOld
[4:08:52] <$Slimshazbot> And the Prey reboot. The story beats of the ending are cool, but god daaaaaamn was it flaccid
[4:08:52] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The other two optional endings for GTA V
[4:08:52] <$WackyXmand> any game the has all the money pushed into the beginning than dies near the middle
[4:08:52] <Ion_Laser> cmonBruh
[4:08:52] <@commanderclaw> This guy *looks* like a Nosferatu
[4:08:54] <$castcode> THIS GUY
[4:08:54] <%nmaten> this guys entire head is fucked
[4:08:58] <+MaddyCaddy> I mean, as an elder, you must have heard of Golconda at least once. You're probably just not even remotely into it because you're too tied to the politics of Jyhad and being a super natural dick.
[4:08:59] <%Admiralpoosh> t101Oof
[4:09:01] <+arcticacrystallos> Hey @AngriestPat what kind of vampire are you? I have only just joined in the stream.

[4:09:12] <Ion_Laser> OH NO
[4:09:12] <rovilm> he looks like an alien
[4:09:12] <%Tearonex> this is embarassing
[4:09:17] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Did David Cage make this?
[4:09:17] <%joylent_blue> arcticacrystallos Tremere
[4:09:19] <CptBritches> This guy is voiced by an Asian voice actor
[4:09:21] <+Disraged> Pat would you ever go on The Dick Show with Paige?
[4:09:21] <$castcode> is this Tyler1
[4:09:25] <%DSD24> @Slimshazbot I really liked Prey's ending its just that last stretch was bad cause of all the loading
[4:09:27] <mar_krow> Asian nasfuratu
[4:09:28] <%ShaneWhite> Lu dang know
[4:09:37] <lloyddboy> HE LOOKS LIKE THE ANTS lN ANTZ
[4:09:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> IDK I like this guy

[4:09:41] <Run44forrest> LUL
[4:09:42] <krymzen5> @Disraged i would love this
[4:09:43] <%rdark_ksu> this dude is rad

[4:09:47] <takokasa> it's Chen stormstout's va
[4:09:50] <%joylent_blue> lloyddboy FUCK
[4:09:51] <%nofestu2> He looks like the hitman from Yakuza 0
[4:09:55] <MasterDecoder> @castcode No, this is Patrick!!
[4:10:00] <ithirstforfreddurst> @ooblag you're thinking of Ox
[4:10:06] <mar_krow> He’s an assassin right
[4:10:09] <natebud> YOu didn't have to spell partner that way devs.
[4:10:10] <RickyRelucent> jiren ja
[4:10:11] <ooblag> Right, shit
[4:10:13] <+Disraged> I want to see Dick tackle the Goblins
[4:10:15] <$Slimshazbot> @DSD24 Ooof yeah. Like I said the ending itself is cool, it just didn't have a lot of... gravitas? Like it's super abrupt. Especially before the after-credits scene
[4:10:22] <Ion_Laser> NotLikeThis
[4:10:27] <Frodiddly> This is so gd racist
[4:10:34] <Ion_Laser> cmonBruh
[4:10:37] <%stabbityrabbit> @MaddyCaddy Even if you've heard of it, there's no guarantee that it's real. If you're an elder you're bound to have heard a lot of lies. Most of them more believable than Golconda.
[4:10:41] <krymzen5> at least he can make L sounds
[4:10:43] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Okay. Brass tacks. In Mandarin and Cantonese grammar, is it actually common to refer to oneself in the third person?
[4:10:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Fuckin' shifty eyes!
[4:10:55] <rumuloh> How is it racist when there are chinese people who actually talk like this
[4:10:58] <CptBritches> I mean this is literally an Asian man voicing this
[4:10:59] <+d00msdaydan> @PlainSimpleTailor no not really, that's more of a japanese thing
[4:11:02] <Quigsies> BOOF
[4:11:04] <Run44forrest> LUL
[4:11:04] <+Krivvan> Chinese accents don't mix up Ls and Rs, that;s Japanaese
[4:11:07] <%Promessa_EX> at least he doesnt say messuh
[4:11:09] <natebud> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
[4:11:11] <haisho> Can confirm this is an accent present in Hong Kong
[4:11:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @d00msdaydan Thanks
[4:11:26] <+Krivvan> and this is a legit accent
[4:11:26] <RupanSen> @rumuloh Because in *current year* everything is racist
[4:11:28] <CalderGaming> "velly well" there you go chat
[4:11:28] <%DSD24> @Slimshazbot I agree that it was really abrupt for some reason I wish they just combined the end credits and after credits
[4:11:36] <krymzen5> LUL
[4:11:38] <haisho> but more people have that weird british-cantonese accent nowadays
[4:11:44] <GothicLoveBlood> Chat gets triggered too easily and have thin skin
[4:11:44] <lloyddboy> CHEATS
[4:11:45] <CptBritches> This voice actor is half Chinese, half Japanese
[4:11:45] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @d00msdaydan That annoyed me so much in Bioshock with Suchong
[4:11:49] <Run44forrest> PogChamo
[4:11:51] <%Dylveryn> Get ready for another $100

[4:12:03] <%El_Desperad0> @RupanSen sounds like a personal problem
[4:12:04] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Console command that old man huge honkers
[4:12:06] <+MaddyCaddy> @stabbityrabbit Of course, you are one hundred percent right. I'm just being broad on the subject of it. Lot more complex when you get to the brass tacks of all that's going on in WoD.
[4:12:08] <ミュウレ4242> this quest can go a few ways, w/ different rewardss.
[4:12:10] <rovilm> this quest is actually funny
[4:12:17] <Ion_Laser> $100? I might be able to buy one bullet with that
[4:12:18] <natebud> It's OK guys, the VA is actually chinese.
[4:12:19] <haisho> Now this guy has a bad accent
[4:12:19] <$castcode> oh my god lmao
[4:12:20] <lloyddboy> THIS FUCKER THOUGH

[4:12:24] <Quigsies> WutFace
[4:12:25] <Ion_Laser> cmonBruh
[4:12:25] <+Krivvan> and here's the contrast
[4:12:25] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is the code Dolly_Parton?
[4:12:26] <ForeverShogo> sad that a lot of the games that try to let you use social fu to solve problems degenerate to combat marathons at the end, completely fucking anyone who actually tries for a social build
[4:12:26] <+McSnazzyPants> i have several relatives that LITERALLY talk like that, i'd be incredibly impressed if that guy was affecting the accent
[4:12:27] <krymzen5> better
[4:12:28] <%FrustratedAF> this.... this feels racist....
[4:12:28] <$castcode> This game is the best holy shit
[4:12:30] <prime_name> Oh geezus
[4:12:35] <InugamiTheHound> but don't Chinese people have a accent when they speak english
[4:12:35] <@commanderclaw> The fuck is up with these guys skulls?
[4:12:35] <takiyami> Did he have sunglasses before?
[4:12:38] <ComancheNate> stan lee?

[4:16:43] <CalderGaming> [stage whisper] i think they were lying about the pedophilia and puppy murder
[4:16:44] <natebud> Lu Feng doesn't ask the girls if they're 18 when he meets them
[4:16:46] <%FrustratedAF> i'm kind of shocked at how functional the cube looks
[4:16:48] <lilmac64> At least it's not a Kid Killer and a Puppy Diddler.
[4:16:49] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat left you a tweet of a imdb I found, not sure if you've seen it already

[4:22:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> bleedpurple500 bonus50 There's something called Golconda, which is a state of enlightenment you can achieve with high Humanity, but it's real hard. Potential benefits are nebulously defined but the books suggest never frenzying, reduced blood requirements, ability to learn Disciplines without being limited by your Generation, losing your clan weakness, or becoming human again. Also, EBF5 is fucking rad. You can learn Giga Drill Breaker as a Limit Break.

[4:24:45] <%JenovasPuppet> Woo, get my name read twice because Twitch Prime is dumb!
[4:25:05] <Sloavon> @Promessa_EX that sounds fucking stupid and I think you are dumb.
[4:25:06] <vinceshamwowslap> yep
[4:25:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Kirby_Sauce just making sure
[4:25:15] <%anAngryHamster> Thank you Septawn!
[4:25:15] <+Estuko> the IMDb for Poor Little White Boy is making me lose my shit
[4:25:20] <+Mockisho> If I had a job, I'd give you my entire paycheck.
[4:25:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> Pat-tic-tic-tock
[4:25:38] <%actual_scum> I think Pat is my first twitch sub too
[4:25:42] <yourliteraldog> there is IMDB for porn movies
[4:25:42] <%Promessa_EX> @sloavon so I guess one the tater cooks down your body can't break down the starchy stuff
[4:26:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> bleedpurple500 bonus50 in addition to the above limit break, Lance has one where he drops his tank, (The Neon Valkyrie) onto the enemy, jumps on, shoots it a bunch, then jumps off before it explodes. There's a 50% or so chance he goes WRRRRRRYYYYY
[4:26:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Huh

[4:26:52] <%MonsieurHedge> coincidentally the tremere leader killed them all
[4:26:52] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The game could be the best shit eveer but still won't play it if it doesn't appeal the eyeballs
[4:26:54] <ForeverShogo> Giovanni are also real pervy. when they make someone a ghoul, they do shit like make them take the first dose of vampire blood through simulated felatio.

[4:27:48] <+MaddyCaddy> There's some gamey bullshit you can do with Golconda if you use the generation bypass to Max fortitude and just tank out the sun forever, so you really don't have to be mortal if you really don't want to
