[0:15:50] <$jaxondorfred> GivePLZ DrinkPurple TakeNRG
[0:15:52] <$Garthunox> how bad did it fuck em up?
[0:15:53] <+PaniniPanzer> big if true
[0:15:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> woof
[0:15:54] <%PalmtopNami> PalmtopNami subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Yay, the 3 most beautiful beings. Elmo, Skelmo and Steve Beshelmo. (is that howd you say that idfk) Also the 100 is frustrating trash, I cant stop watching it to scream at it.
[0:15:54] <The_500lb_Child> but that is why they are testing it out.
[0:15:54] <%Skrypto> yes
[0:15:54] <%Despera__> 2 hours is standard?
[0:15:55] <Doodle_Taco> But they signed tho....
[0:15:55] <C_S_N_G> 17 years
[0:15:56] <%Remery_> FOR SCIENCE
[0:15:56] <+Estuko> @daisymaisy02 tell crack heads that LUL
[0:15:59] <starotter70> Oh shit
[0:16:00] <FunkyStreams> its like going into a spaceship flipping some toggles and seeing what happens.
[0:16:01] <%TenderBabyBacon> That sounds like a way to mess some people up
[0:16:02] <%TheKillerKalamari> The Stanford Experiment was pretty horrible
[0:16:06] <%Nordguy> thats literally a form of torture
[0:16:09] <%PROUD2beGINGER> That's called un-sounding
[0:16:10] <+Nomicro4u> I'm not locked in here with you
[0:16:10] <ScreamingMeat> Russian Sleep Experiment
[0:16:14] <FunkyStreams> only difference is the spaceship is a human being'
[0:16:20] <%Despera__> Ohhh it's a room?
[0:16:22] <$Garthunox> stranger things
[0:16:26] <%Agami23> remember when brental floss did that for like 3 days?
[0:16:29] <%thewinged7> We do what we must, because we can sipsipHellmo
[0:16:30] <zal_silverfang> just got in, what are the specifics of this convo?
[0:16:31] <daisymaisy02> The room would probably fuck me up more than the tank tbh
[0:16:32] <%TheKillerKalamari> sorry, The Stanford Prison Experiment
[0:16:33] <+tigerfang86> the room makes you go INSANE
[0:16:34] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The fact that the guy behind the Stanford Experiment was not executed is horrifying
[0:16:35] <%Despera__> Sensory deprivation tanks are relaxing and an easy 2 hors
[0:16:37] <%laserbeaming> Are you going Punch build? There's some really good kill animations for that
[0:16:39] <VJdarkworld> Hyperbolic time chamber
[0:16:39] <alrobot2014> the thought of that shit makes me feel like im suffocating
[0:16:40] <kingra> That sounds like hell
[0:16:42] <%brave_sj> Bro but them not knowing is part of the experiment it's super sciencey
[0:16:45] <rytisone> the most clean room for Pat
[0:16:47] <+neuwaive> what about that sound room where they could hear their own organs
[0:16:47] <%thewinged7> Go watch a VSauce video on it
[0:16:48] <dekkitout> Cool~
[0:16:49] <mysterious_chicken> That sounds terrifying
[0:16:50] <+Estuko> @laserbeaming like that german suplex Kreygasm
[0:16:50] <%ElenaManetta> Sensory deprivation cube
[0:16:52] <%PROUD2beGINGER> He's dead now
[0:16:53] <reonome> Vsauce did it
[0:16:53] <%spiritofmojave> That sounds horrible man
[0:16:53] <%NWR_James> Hi Paige and Elmo! Oh and I guess Pat
[0:16:54] <daisymaisy02> I have focus problems and need noise in the background at all times to not get antsy so that'd do real bad things to my brain

[0:16:59] <Doodle_Taco> What a hero
[0:17:02] <Alchemystee> also 3 days i think
[0:17:03] <Applecannon63> oh what the fuck
[0:17:03] <+TehBeerBaron> 6 days I think
[0:17:03] <%Agami23> oh wait.
[0:17:04] <%TenderBabyBacon> it's the difference between feeling like you are nonexistant and feeling like you are always muted
[0:17:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> fuck
[0:17:05] <FunkyStreams> If left in a sensory dep tank for more than 24hrs the odds of you comitting suicide are extremely high
[0:17:06] <%skizzuto> VSauce did the room one for 3 days
[0:17:06] <%spiritofmojave> I can barely stay up 2 days
[0:17:06] <%TheOmegaKidSeven> minutes counts as torture.
[0:17:06] <strongweeb> whats the name of the room that plays safety dance at max volume forever
