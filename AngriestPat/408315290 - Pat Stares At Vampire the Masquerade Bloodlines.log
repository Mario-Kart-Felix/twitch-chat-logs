[0:17:44] <Cobaltor_252> the entirety of Toronto's king street lost power during rush hour, good times commuting home
[0:17:44] <$RubberFistFight> Pumps are an inductive load, so they usually get damaged if their flyback diode has died at some point and they stop - the voltage built up in the coils has nowhere to go and damages stuff as it dissipates rather quickly, meaning high current in a short time.

[0:19:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 oh yeah, first day of summer weather here in NY. Thanks global warming! Lot of the coast will be sunk in a generation or two. I went to my friend's birthday party the other day (the sandwich one). Over the course of the party she stole both of the party she stole both my hard and soft hairbands, unfurling my long luxurious hair from its ponytail. When she wanted to braid it, I flipped all my hair over my face, enough to cover the whole thing. She wouldn't relent, so I said settle it in

[0:26:23] <JoeyStar> I still like both
[0:26:24] <OwlLightningMage> The nanomachines somehow glitched and made me unkillable
[0:26:27] <arcaderabbit48> Gungeon is much better, but I have to say I don't like how shooting feels in that game. Which sucks, because it is genuinely fantastic
[0:26:34] <%rytyoung> you need to play ALL the rougelikes

[0:26:57] <%spiritofmojave> Absolutely
[0:27:01] <@SSaryn> Except for Rouge with laser pistol holy shit I hate that accuracy
[0:27:01] <BallinArbiter> It’s fun to play the game
[0:27:03] <emillionghost> fair
[0:27:04] <%crimsonharvest> so @AngriestPat have you played any of the modern descendants of the actual real turn-based RPG roguelikes, such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, or Tales of Maj'Eyal
[0:27:05] <%ElenaManetta> Isaac's hitbox feels really hard to grasp. Sometimes I get hit when I feel like I shouldn't have.
[0:27:05] <OwlLightningMage> Gungeon feels the best to play just on a control level
[0:27:05] <FlyguyJP> Polished Vs Depth
[0:27:07] <Kefkaisnotamused> Hades looks amazing.
[0:27:07] <nerdblase> Systems vs Mechanics.
[0:27:08] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Eh, fair enough
[0:27:08] <+Grayhammatter> isaac just feels super janky compared to gungeon
[0:27:11] <Nina96> Issac movement sucks i cant play it becasue of that
[0:27:13] <Cobaltor_252> how does Dead Cells rank up?
[0:27:16] <%IMDRanged> Twin stick shooters. Practice with Robotron
[0:27:17] <+dyedeme> I'm ready for Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup to get its claws in you
[0:27:18] <%El_Desperad0> Risk of Rain 1 is MUCH better
[0:27:19] <%ArcanumMBD> @Dio_TR you're trading analogue movement for ultra precise shooting with mouse. It depends on what you value more
[0:27:22] <+skylerpilot> Dead Cells is great
[0:27:23] <sir_nack> being limited to 4 directions in isaac is a turn off
[0:27:23] <+PenmanLupine> Isaac is a game where you have to discover and earn your fun, which means the game isn't fun to start
[0:27:24] <%rytyoung> Issac has a way different aiming and movement style that takes a lot to master
[0:27:24] <GhostLanterns> hello fellow vampires
[0:27:25] <derekwst3> we need a issac style game but with kamen rider
[0:27:26] <MajesticSundew> Risk of Rain 1 is amazing
[0:27:30] <%bread_assassin> I like roguelikes that have some level of progression between runs. Issac has new characters, but that's pretty much it,
[0:27:31] <@SSaryn> Once 12 months goes by, itll do a gud
[0:27:36] <%rytyoung> dead cells is amazing

[0:27:52] <Kefkaisnotamused> Screw vampires. Being a Kitsune is where it's at. :D <3
[0:27:53] <gustavozxd> they changed a lot, i played the game at launch, stopped a bit and played it yesterday and a lot has changed for the better
[0:27:55] <%Fenlig> I feel like I hit a part in Dead cells where I'm just grinding
[0:27:57] <Dio_TR> @ArcanumMBD thanks for the info gamepad got busted a month ago and don't have money to replace it right now
[0:28:03] <OwlLightningMage> I don't even wanna touch Hades until its fucking done
[0:28:07] <MarylandJutsu> put more shit in hadse
[0:28:09] <%velemi> Risk of Rain is the only one of these that is multiplayer
[0:28:11] <+SwiftTheFox_> Are you going to do the beta of RAD?
[0:28:13] <Asakiira> Can someone donating ask about Pathfinder? Is playable now and I love that oldschool CRPG. :o
[0:28:18] <%spiritofmojave> give it time for content, Gungeon is like 3 years old now and is CHOCKED full of shit now
[0:28:19] <twistedhands> I love risk of rai largely because of the music tbh
[0:28:19] <gustavozxd> i have 0 interest in hades because early access
[0:28:20] <%KaizenChaos> Yaaa Hades
[0:28:21] <FlyguyJP> Amount of shit VS Polish of the Shit
[0:28:23] <Daxalog> @AngriestPat ROR was one of the first. It gained a Cult following cause of it. And was kept alive due to its easy to setup multiplayer and difficulty modifiers.
[0:28:23] <%BoboDaHobo> risk of rain 2 is way better when you get the other characters but it definitely has a slow start to every run
[0:28:27] <Nina96> @AngriestPat Hades got that art though
[0:28:31] <%blastazoid26> Can't wait till hades comes to switch

[0:29:13] <KatabolicRage> I jumped into pathfinder kingmaker, my knowledge of pathfinder was rather helpful because oh boy can you screw up d20 systems
[0:29:14] <FlyguyJP> Ah the magical moment of being the wrong spec
[0:29:14] <pectusumbra> Call it a feature
[0:29:16] <RutilusMonachus> Like trying to make a Charisma based character in Baldurs Gate
[0:29:17] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> That's a big issue I have with that game, I never end up getting far because of it
[0:29:17] <jijipose> Just play Paladin, it half forces you to have good stats
[0:29:17] <Jflaskd13> depends on the edition. 5E is pretty forgiving
[0:29:19] <Novillion> Especially 2nd Edition
[0:29:28] <%Mornaka> 5e is pretty straight forward
[0:29:29] <%Remery_> Does Pat have good stats?

[0:29:51] <%crimsonharvest> FIST MAGIC
[0:29:54] <$RubberFistFight> Wow, Khadgar. You're a pretty shit wizard.
[0:29:56] <$ItsRatman> So a Star Platinum?
[0:29:56] <%king_wragles> There are alternative classes, but a lot of them suck
[0:29:56] <KatabolicRage> this is relevant because VtM is a tabletop game
[0:29:57] <%dukenux> A Copromancer WutFace
[0:30:00] <SilverFaustX> SMOrc i wizard
[0:30:01] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat I was actually referring to Etrian Odyssey. The series is fine now, but when it started out half the skills were bugged to being useless, overpowered, or irrelevant, and many of the descriptions lied to you.
[0:30:01] <Kefkaisnotamused> WIzard gets no good physical feats, so having 300 strength would be pointless.
[0:30:01] <%LeftOverPizza13> DUPRE ROCKS
[0:30:02] <Dio_TR> Doing the right thing in games that have morality systems give me anxiety because if i don't go full goody two shoes i just paralyze with decision
[0:30:04] <%thegostofjon> older versions of dnd are so fucking dense i cant get into them, but 5e is SO easy and open to character build in
[0:30:05] <%salty_syd913> Monks 4 eva
[0:30:05] <RutilusMonachus> >when you can't cast spells past first level because you made your character too stupid
[0:30:08] <%crimsonharvest> PUGILMANCER
[0:30:14] <derekwst3> quick people donate
[0:30:18] <KatabolicRage> VtM in tabletop does support full social builds, the game does need you to be able to fight but social skills can do some cool stuff
[0:30:18] <%TeraMercier> I feel like it's very important that you can be BAD at something as a character in a game so that when you have a good build it doesn't feel like the game is pandering to you
[0:30:22] <%topendbuzz> nice
[0:30:26] <%king_wragles> Like, Eldritch Knight could just be an actual wizard with some physical stats or feats
[0:30:28] <nerdblase> Cause Gainax.
[0:30:29] <MajesticSundew> Honestly D&D is kind of a shit P&P game, it's just that it's become the most entrenched

[0:30:46] <%king_wragles> and Tempest Melee could JUST BE A PALADIN
[0:30:46] <Kefkaisnotamused> Tabletop VtM is best... until you get to nWOD and 5th edition, ew.
[0:30:49] <DracaenaLeaf> all the player characters look dead as shit lol
[0:30:50] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Have no choice to be MOISTULATED
[0:30:51] <Vvvzzzlllvvvzzzlllvvv> Only plebs don't have 3 dots in Path of Conjuring
[0:30:52] <Asakiira> Pillars lets you fuck up a bit...but not much... Pathfinder is old school 'you pick the wrong stats, you suck and you fail hard'.
[0:30:57] <%laserbeaming> Pathfinder Kingmaker has this character that has the most suboptimal stat distribution for a tank fighter ever. She's awful and is permanently on my bench
[0:31:08] <%joylent_blue> kirby what the fuck
[0:31:11] <redsynod> D&D is a dungeon crawling game shaped peg that everyone wants to use for everything
[0:31:11] <%king_wragles> for real though, a bad cleric is just being poorly used by the player. Cleric OP
[0:31:13] <StaticSunrise> what the fuck
[0:31:14] <%spiritofmojave> sugoiLain

[0:31:16] <%TeraMercier> Vampires don't have to bodily excrete, making them a nice degree of clean
[0:31:16] <%dukenux> Always have Speedwagon on my mind... an in my heart
[0:31:17] <BigCoffee> the pathfinder kingmaker characters are all absolute shit
[0:31:17] <Meekest> what
[0:31:17] <Dio_TR> @Kefkaisnotamused heard the newest edition is really awful
[0:31:20] <%thegostofjon> I heard it was fucked at launch
[0:31:20] <%Verd_254> @RubberFistFight Considering it's going for 200$+ now I'd say so.
[0:31:22] <sappinmahbinyot> Why
[0:31:23] <+d00msdaydan> is that how king crimson works?
[0:31:23] <Mr_Strut> How does king crimson work?
[0:31:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh Kirby never stop

[0:31:33] <BallinArbiter> Jesus that’s complicated
[0:31:33] <+Grayhammatter> how does king crimson work?
[0:31:33] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I remember a story about a Half-Orc Rogue that had NO stealth but a SHITTON of Intimidation. When "sneaking" he'd just walk uot guards and scream "YOU NO SEE GROG!!!!" in their face and they'd go "We can't see you!" because his intimation was so high

Dnd update: one of my players (fighter) wants to follow a lovecraftian demon into a realm of all water. He's level 1. I'd do king crimson for the lulz.

[0:35:07] <gustavozxd> @Run44forrest it's a big spoiler, are you sure?
[0:35:07] <%SolidusRex> apatHoldon
[0:35:08] <%apostateCourier> it does

[0:35:47] <FlyguyJP> Pat is just saving all other men from suffering Paige's "diseased snatch"
[0:35:51] <rich518> did you get the fan mod that does a lot of quality of life stuff for the game? @AngriestPat
[0:35:56] <%gus_hornblende> yes.. yes..
[0:36:00] <Gorgen> yes.
[0:36:00] <%FrustratedAF> pat what the fuck why do you smell like liquids

[0:36:07] <%NoMoreHero51> NoMoreHero51 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 27 months holy crap just goes to show how entertaining you continue to be, keep up the good work man!
[0:36:07] <%hepabuttlicker> @RubberFistFight Its a cool and complex topic that cant be fully explained in this forum. Wikipedia is pretty good on info. Dont listen to random webpages. Lots of bad info out there. I totally understand if your interest in this extends only to this conversation though
[0:36:08] <%cTAKU> @angriestpat speaking of water surprises came home today to a crack in my toliets tank currently on dry duty while I watch the stream
[0:36:13] <Zer0beats> wheres the drugs pat?
[0:36:14] <+walnutcast> !uptime
[0:36:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 36m 16s.
[0:36:17] <zedravan> you can beat griffith
[0:36:17] <%crimsonharvest> the weight doesn't localize the same
[0:36:19] <Gorgen> my deadly queen will destroy you
[0:36:20] <arcaderabbit48> I started watching the dub purely because of D. C. Douglas
[0:36:20] <$cureneckbeard> josuke touhou
[0:36:23] <zedravan> can´t*
[0:36:29] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ??
[0:36:30] <+d00msdaydan> is there a single dub where they talk like people actually would and not like that really awkward and stilted way they normally talk in dubs?
[0:36:33] <PowerfulBlackGangs> He's a tremere. He is a cheat engine
[0:36:33] <KatabolicRage> also why would he need cheat engine to fuck with a source game
[0:36:34] <%dukenux> Yeah but eng Kars was great
[0:36:35] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat no you just need cheat engine in general
[0:36:35] <gustavozxd> @Run44forrest so the upper DS screen is junpei, the lower DS screen is june from the past the whole time, the "narrator" is her looking at him in the future, there's obviously none of that in the ps4 version, and the final puzzle is changed and it's lame
[0:36:36] <BunnyEmperor> lipsmack
[0:36:36] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> why do people do this?
[0:36:38] <+risenchudjr> you won't need noclip if you have the patch
[0:36:38] <PSI_Guy95> Pat IS using the unofficial patch right
[0:36:40] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You don't need cheat engine, just open the console
[0:36:41] <%DigitalJoshie> the dub is good, but I'm just used to Japanese
[0:36:41] <PhantaniumOG> can just use console
[0:36:42] <PSI_Guy95> Just enter noclip into the fucking console
[0:36:42] <Vvvzzzlllvvvzzzlllvvv> And you could just noclip with the console?
[0:36:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> You ARE a nosferatu
[0:36:44] <KatabolicRage> it's source engine, he probably still remmembers all the half life 2 commands
[0:36:45] <Sloavon> my dead;y queen will ensure complete global saturation
[0:36:45] <%dukenux> Okuyasu sounded good too
[0:36:46] <PowerfulBlackGangs> \0/
[0:36:47] <Kefkaisnotamused> Sooo... what clan would Dio even be... True Brujah..?
[0:36:48] <%PharosOfLight> A lot of people like to no-clip the sewers because... its the originator of the "Sewers are bad" thing
[0:36:49] <Mr_Strut> Pat plays a nosferatu in real life
[0:36:50] <%vectorless_peon> vectorless_peon converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:36:51] <VRNK> gottem
[0:36:51] <Dio_TR> You have console commands in the game just use `
[0:36:51] <%Verd_254> noclip can be useful in general for getting unstuck, but you don't need cheat engine for that just type noclip in console
[0:36:51] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He's already playing as the best clan B)
[0:36:52] <+TehBeerBaron> Fucking spoilers
[0:36:52] <%SolidusRex> You're playing a Nosferatu in real life.
[0:36:54] <%Casual_Matt> pat is the nosferatu

[0:37:01] <Matermind0> I’ve never needed chest engine

[0:37:45] <%lewdskeletor13> That was a quick answer

[0:58:31] <%supersugoisenpai1> "Yeah, that's f'ed up" I say as I organize my Oreimo mangas
[0:58:32] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, cause you ruined something she cared about without asking you to do anything of the sort

[0:59:06] <Peculiar_Pangolin> It's owned 40% by Tencent that's the issue
[0:59:07] <Ion_Laser> Steam needs REAL competition
[0:59:08] <%SaltyDongs> Skip it

[0:59:17] <%Prevot> CJ walking: aw shit here we go again
[0:59:17] <OwlLightningMage> The Epic game store is bad for consumers and good for devs. That's the long and short of it

[0:59:18] <+Grayhammatter> deaddead

[0:59:26] <%NovaKnightmare> Cringe but redpilled
[0:59:26] <MajesticSundew> Also THERE ARE ALREADY COMPETITORS TO STEAM GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY INSTEAD
[0:59:27] <%velemi> thats not what net neutrality is?!?!
[0:59:27] <+Noxybaru> Tencent doesn't even have a controlling stake in Epic
[0:59:27] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He's actually right tho about the data thing
[0:59:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> That's what I'm saying
[0:59:32] <%genowyn> Those things aren't related...
[0:59:33] <%Fenrirlives> Nah Let him!\
[0:59:33] <KaliasTV> Elmo are you ok
[0:59:34] <BeagleCypher> GOG MASTER RACE
[0:59:34] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> yes
[0:59:38] <SchroedingersFerret> The last Vampire on Earth > Twilight
[0:59:38] <+cvp5127> duh
[0:59:40] <yourliteraldog> But also most girls of certain age have read and liked twilight
[0:59:41] <Meekest> look at elmo
[0:59:44] <Graywolf_the_45th> It's not competing it's just trying to take over
[0:59:45] <+pentacade> GOG GANGGG
[0:59:45] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> but epic games is not actual competition
[0:59:47] <%DigitalJoshie> apatDab epic store apatDab
[0:59:47] <+HeadsHeldHigh> publisher level
[0:59:48] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Support GOG if you want good competition to Steam
[0:59:50] <+HeadsHeldHigh> not developer
[0:59:52] <+Zxtole> Only once place to buy a game vs 20, very nice competition
[0:59:54] <MajesticSundew> 20% I think
[0:59:54] <T_Sasquatch> its not competition if you just pay for exclusives
[0:59:58] <PSI_Guy95> timed exclusives are mad gay
[0:59:59] <Angry_Ev1L> Pat is on point. Consumer gets nooooooothing
[0:59:59] <InugamiTheHound> steam, origins, Play,GOG and now epic store.
[0:59:59] <conflict1914> "Okay he's competition, the competition is shit, so i'm not going there"
[1:00:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BIDDING WAR
[1:00:05] <KeystoneA1> Tiananmen Square
[1:00:06] <DocMadfox> Watching Pat play this has made me want to find a Vampire the Masquerade game...
[1:00:07] <%spiritofmojave> GOG should be the competitive titan to Steam, not Epic
[1:00:08] <+risenchudjr> THEFT
[1:00:09] <pimpinahz> Elmo looking for hair
[1:00:11] <sappinmahbinyot> GOG has no competition cause nobody supports it. Because it plays fair FeelsBadMan
[1:00:11] <+Noxybaru> Yeah I use GOG and *** primarily as alternatives
[1:00:12] <@SSaryn> It's the only thing they got going honestly
[1:00:13] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat It looks like StreamLabs ate my donation message last stream so I'll ask it here. Have you seen the fan-design weapons for MHW Iceborne and which one do you like the most? I have a special place in my heart for the Meowscular Chef #1 Hammer
[1:00:13] <MachigattaLT> NAILED IT
[1:00:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> Free market. Pay off who you can man
[1:00:17] <holyBrigand> pet the cat pls
[1:00:18] <$nitronLVIII> Its not competion its one monopoly replacing another
[1:00:19] <gloppie> This is capitalism baby
[1:00:19] <+cvp5127> strongarming?
[1:00:19] <SoaringLettuce> buying exclusives is not competing, its making the other service worse
[1:00:20] <$valriot> The consumer loses nothing, so everyones being a fucking baby over 10-20 year old 7/10 games
[1:00:21] <%CerberusDriver> A legit competition
[1:00:28] <DracaenaLeaf> steam doesn't want to be a monopoly though
[1:00:29] <MajesticSundew> BUY FROM GOG YOU FUCKS
[1:00:34] <%apostateCourier> capitalism is... bad
[1:00:37] <nekodelic> this is basically capitalism
[1:00:38] <OwlLightningMage> Give Elmo fake hair that only looks like his own hair
[1:00:39] <+Zxtole> Steam promotes developers to put their games on other stores, it doesn't want to be a monopoly
[1:00:39] <gustavozxd> the argument is mostly about how secure epic store is which has been questionable
[1:00:39] <a_mad_dragon> it's epic waving their arms going "LOOK WE CAN BE STEAM TOO'
[1:00:41] <pimpinahz> I already do lol
[1:00:42] <FunkyStreams> it could actually be because Epic is better geared to crossplatform support for this paticular titl, like randy said, but fuck me right?
[1:00:42] <%puhff> :o

[1:00:50] <sappinmahbinyot> Tencent owns fucking everything
[1:00:53] <Etherealizer> The temp exclusivity is the price we'll have to pay if we wanna kill Steam's monopoly. Also someone already debunked the spying stuff.
[1:00:53] <SoaringLettuce> the spyware stuff turned out to be wrong didnt it?
[1:00:55] <SchroedingersFerret> It's a bad thing

[1:01:08] <Gameslayer2> Riot
[1:01:09] <i_worship_his_shadow> I think epic just wants to be aggressive about cutting into the market. They can't give the same deal they've given to recent devs forever.

[1:01:53] <GundamF91> Tencent owns like the entirety of Riot Game's I think LOL
[1:01:55] <%Freelance7> NO SHOPPING CART
[1:01:55] <gustavozxd> eat the hair
[1:01:56] <+FilthyHereticHorus> Nixon already sold us all to China @AngriestPat
[1:01:56] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Elmo's hair is tasty
[1:01:56] <OwlLightningMage> The store fucking sucks
[1:01:57] <PSI_Guy95> "update: we have a search function"
[1:01:57] <%GarbageNirvana> It could use some work
[1:01:59] <FunkyStreams> so did steam when it came out
[1:01:59] <conflict1914> better then bethesda
[1:01:59] <%puhff> That it do!
[1:01:59] <%dukenux> ye
[1:02:00] <%FrustratedAF> its barely a store
[1:02:00] <+dirtyjuice_> What if I just block my information from china by spamming banned words in every thing I say?
[1:02:01] <Peculiar_Pangolin> it is proven. Tencent are known for spying on Chinese citizens for the government
[1:02:01] <%ORGANizerC> i'll use it when it actually has features
[1:02:02] <DagetStreams> King of crazy tells us people are crazy
[1:02:02] <%ElenaManetta> But NOT offline
[1:02:02] <$valriot> Yeah but big spooky chinaman with the slinty eyes is evil
[1:02:04] <Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[1:02:04] <SPKTR34> elmo is a chinese spy
[1:02:04] <zipfile777> LUL
[1:02:05] <Run44forrest> why do people care so much about their info like what do they thinks gonna happen
[1:02:06] <sappinmahbinyot> LUL
[1:02:06] <withguac> Everyone already buys your info already but plz NOT THE CHINKS
[1:02:06] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah, no search function till recently and a bunch of other bloat garbage
[1:02:06] <%lewdskeletor13> ROADMAP THO
[1:02:07] <dbgt5551> Better than origin and uplay
[1:02:07] <DatAsuna> Or uplay
[1:02:07] <+MrTurtleThief> LUL
[1:02:07] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:02:08] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[1:02:08] <%ItsRatman> LUL
[1:02:08] <gustavozxd> elmo eating hair
[1:02:09] <%ElenaManetta> Not offline is a huge dealbreaker.
[1:02:09] <+HeadsHeldHigh> lol
[1:02:10] <XeloGel> always online
[1:02:11] <PSI_Guy95> "udpate: we added advanced search"
[1:02:11] <%MelBrooksKA> @Flambage Tencent owns 10% of Elmo BibleThump
[1:02:11] <%Freelance7> DAMN
[1:02:12] <i_worship_his_shadow> and uplay
[1:02:12] <%puhff> It sucks, but at least it works
[1:02:13] <%averyoddjew> that's not hard
[1:02:14] <%ORGANizerC> so it should be around the time control comes out
[1:02:14] <Gameslayer2> The epic games store.. is a thing
[1:02:15] <thegreenbenis> PLAY MY SUMMER CAR
[1:02:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Wow. High standards here
[1:02:15] <DatAsuna> Uplay constantly doesn't launch siege for me
[1:02:15] <SpaceGuntank> lol
[1:02:16] <withguac> Lol
[1:02:18] <Ion_Laser> occasionally? WutFace
[1:02:18] <pimpinahz> lol that's not saying much
[1:02:19] <%topendbuzz> uplay?
[1:02:19] <BoneofMalkav> lol
[1:02:19] <%spiritofmojave> not a high bar man LUL
[1:02:20] <indig0bird> That's baaaad
[1:02:20] <DatAsuna> OR close it properly
[1:02:22] <%chaumiester> Ah, so like Epic Launcher
[1:02:22] <FunkyStreams> ...if youre shit at building PCs and admining
[1:02:22] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't use the Epic store for their mediocre security measures, not this dubious nonsense about your data being sold
[1:02:22] <PKHTjim> Oof. Hot take.
[1:02:22] <a_mad_dragon> i forgot origin existed
[1:02:22] <+HunterInABox> Epic launcher takes longer to launch than the games do LUL
[1:02:22] <theshillman> oh and tencent has a long history of IP and game asset theft in CN exclusive titles
[1:02:23] <%machshop> still a ways behind GOG
[1:02:23] <+Disname23> There is no shopping cart in the Epic store, how can people accept this
[1:02:26] <Etherealizer> Benefit of Epic is actually the devs getting paid more and the consumer paying less, so its a win-win
[1:02:30] <samsstand> remember when Steam launched? it fucking sucked ass.
[1:02:31] <indig0bird> @DatAsuna Straight to the neck
[1:02:31] <DatAsuna> I ALWAYS have to task amanger to close ym uplay games correctly
[1:02:31] <%GarbageNirvana> TBH if I get BL3 it'll probably be on the PS4 anyway
[1:02:32] <SoaringLettuce> again, buying exclusives isnt competing, its making the other service worse
[1:02:33] <FrenchTact1cs> I like origin more than uplay
[1:02:34] <+luketrapwalker> People forget how bad Steam used to be
[1:02:35] <%puhff> 6 months for Shopping Carts LUL
[1:02:35] <+SimplesRock> what about the gamestop online store experience?
[1:02:36] <jazzpunk> based GOG
[1:02:36] <+Grayhammatter> the baby
[1:02:36] <viviknight> Is good cat
[1:02:37] <%madhattergay> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon apatHoldon
[1:02:37] <@SSaryn> its even on the roadmap of improvements they put up
[1:02:39] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo is so loveable
[1:02:39] <+dirtyjuice_> cade'
[1:02:39] <%segonian> I miss CD keys
[1:02:40] <%ElenaManetta> I don't love Elmo. He takes attention away from US! THE FANS, WE MATTER MORE!!!!
[1:02:41] <+Blargimazombie> NO. Way.
[1:02:42] <gustavozxd> elmo is like half pat's size
[1:02:42] <%ORGANizerC> @samsstand yeah 15 years ago
[1:02:42] <Maldoree> BegWan BegWan
[1:02:44] <%crimsonharvest> epic store status downgraded from "menace" to "stage hazard"
[1:02:45] <+Noxybaru> Origin also sometimes makes it difficult to find my actual fucking game library. Like it just removes the fucking link for no reason sometimes
[1:02:45] <%nameless_majin> apatGib apatHoldon apatGib apatHoldon
[1:02:46] <%ORGANizerC> there's a standard now
[1:02:46] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Hence why you shouldn't buy that ridiculous Discord Pro thing - ESPECIALLY since they got caught silently adding a clause to their TOS saying that if they sold your info and it got used for something nefarious, you couldn't sue them.
[1:02:49] <RoboXGP> same
[1:02:50] <+ChestMimik> Pat imprintong on Elmo confirmed
[1:02:50] <%dukenux> apatBig
[1:02:51] <LtSergei> Pat you moron
[1:02:52] <Dovakhin573> here the whole epic dosent matter to me cause in getting BD3 on ps4 anyway
[1:02:52] <NumberTooBig> or console
[1:02:52] <coltonmjones1018> I got battlefield 1 on origin for super cheap a few months ago and have yet to launch it successfully, but I couldn't get a refund either
[1:02:53] <LtSergei> pat stop
[1:02:54] <Run44forrest> @AngriestPat would you clone elmo if you could
[1:02:55] <$saturnianocean> Same
[1:02:55] <FunkyStreams> ALL OF THAT that just to say i dont give af
[1:02:55] <%CerberusDriver> @GarbageNirvana gamestop exclusive ;)

[1:03:00] <indig0bird> I mean, Uplay is just a step above Microsoft Store
[1:03:02] <derekwst3> im getting it on xbone personally
[1:03:03] <+Emperor_Bad> everything is awful
[1:03:04] <aristomuse> he's stalling so he doesn't get haunted by Mel Gibson
[1:03:05] <%TheGreatBamBe> Guaranteed REVENUE
[1:03:05] <%MetalPanic> MetalPanic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Teach Elmo to answer your tweets for you
[1:03:05] <%Prevot> ew
[1:03:06] <%madhattergay> pet da peepee
[1:03:06] <%TeraMercier> How often do you get Elmo hair in your mouth from kissing him?
[1:03:07] <%ElenaManetta> Roadmap?
[1:03:07] <%PalmtopNami> yeet
[1:03:07] <+Emperor_Bad> big surprise
[1:03:08] <yourliteraldog> China only cares about what their citizens do. More over tencent isn't State Owned Enterpise so they aren't on the governments short list for favors
[1:03:09] <leargo> we just want game
[1:03:09] <+wwwwwww1> care about your data guys, google or china or tencent may know what you jerk off to now but that doesn't mean you need to let them know what you jerk off to 5-10 years from now
[1:03:09] <DatAsuna> Pat, jut start doing UE4 dev streams.
[1:03:09] <%afronooch> man, i couldn't give a single shit about BL3
[1:03:12] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Why not get it on console instead? IT gets you the game and boycots a poor service
[1:03:13] <+HunterInABox> I hear Metro crashes as much as this game does tho
[1:03:13] <%crimsonharvest> I bought Satisfactory off the Epic store and it rules
[1:03:13] <Razor4145> !uptime
[1:03:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 3m.
[1:03:16] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd rather just replay Borderlands 2
[1:03:19] <NanayaPeng> Games for Windows Live boys Kappa
[1:03:20] <MajesticSundew> God damn it please do not encourage this fucking anti-competitive exclusive buying horseshit
[1:03:21] <%ElenaManetta> Two step exists?
[1:03:21] <%ItsRatman> Pat what if Epic paid you big money to make your stream exclusive to their store?
[1:03:22] <pimpinahz> dont support Fortnite...tf is wrong with you
[1:03:27] <Dio_TR> Pat stares at FT Randy Pitchford coming SOOOON
[1:03:27] <Archmortal> After all the bullshit Gearbox has done since Borderlands 2 I legit can't justify giving a single cent to Gearbox
[1:03:28] <%Faustgesicht> Still not fucking doing it.
[1:03:33] <simulationbard> That's dumb
[1:03:38] <$valriot> NOBODY is gonna care in 4-5 months, people are being fucking children

[1:03:51] <%JayEarly> If the Fortnite war-chest runs out, EGS will either have to take a bigger cut or die.
[1:03:52] <FunkyStreams> all the clients are guilty of it
[1:03:52] <reiju_22> yep

[1:03:54] <ScreamingMeat> Wow
[1:03:55] <Jeemukun> i remember that
[1:03:55] <%Nope80808> I dont care if my data is stolen. Ive had an account stolen from those fucks.
[1:03:56] <%MetalPanic> but pat, if they did Email verification, then the little children with phones would need emails to play Fortnite
[1:03:56] <%ElenaManetta> NO?
[1:03:56] <%spiritofmojave> I remember that shit
[1:03:56] <Mr_Strut> How?
[1:03:57] <+Noxybaru> That was a fucking MESS
[1:03:57] <Run44forrest> hackerman
[1:03:57] <LtSergei> and throwing away your power as a consumer
[1:03:57] <OwlLightningMage> That happened to me too LUL
[1:03:59] <Ion_Laser> I remember

[1:04:06] <+Maids4lyfe> I REMEMBER THAT SHIT
[1:04:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:04:07] <$saturnianocean> That was a mess
[1:04:08] <valachi> The weirdest part is how it requires a fucking phone number when you try and deactivate an Epic Account
[1:04:08] <Dio_TR> @ElenaManetta it was a Steam Bug where Card Info got leaked to other people
[1:04:09] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> When was this???
[1:04:09] <%ORGANizerC> pat don't hack other people's steam accounts that's not nice
[1:04:10] <+KongolComet> but you couldn't do or see anything important
[1:04:10] <starotter70> Oh yeah
[1:04:10] <%PharosOfLight> I think the Fallout 76 giving out peoples credit cards and addresses was worse
[1:04:11] <%averyoddjew> i yeah i remember that nonsense
[1:04:13] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat ON CHRISTMAS
[1:04:15] <FunkyStreams> little bit different but okay
[1:04:15] <%brickwall35> wasn't it just a visual thing though?
[1:04:16] <yourliteraldog> Chinese Poltics is pretty interesting, but rest assured the business men are their to make money and the state is there to encourage them.
[1:04:17] <%ElenaManetta> sipsipGasm
[1:04:17] <%salty_syd913> oh
[1:04:18] <pimpinahz> cool

[1:04:24] <%segonian> WTF
[1:04:24] <OwlLightningMage> I was so confused when it happened to me LUL
[1:04:25] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> OOH YIKES. That's not great.
[1:04:26] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[1:04:28] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat when did this happen?
[1:04:30] <+ChestMimik> Steam ruined Christmas before Woolie could that year
[1:04:30] <$cureneckbeard> What about the Eve Online update that deleted C:\
[1:04:30] <+ArmaIy> Was the worst because it was always someone near you.
[1:04:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Pinesolbb)
[1:04:32] <Rhinoprotoss> Why would you leave your info on it?
[1:04:32] <%spiritofmojave> YEEEEP

[1:04:35] <%ElenaManetta> Hey wait a minute... I got scammed $500 3 months ago...
[1:04:35] <%dukenux> Did you rub your dick juice all over their acvounts?
[1:04:37] <$RubberFistFight> One of my followers has a friend who got the same 2FA verification key from Epic 3 TIMES IN A ROW. Even though after they expire they should be permanently cycled out by the seed algorithm.
[1:04:38] <Desertfishing> DONT save BANK INFO ON STUFF ON THE INTERNET

[1:04:48] <$LocDogX86X> damn thats bad
[1:04:49] <%Shadowthedigger> Steam having issues does not excuse Epic from having issues.
[1:04:49] <DatAsuna> The REAL reason he bought a house
[1:04:50] <$cureneckbeard> Is that why Pat had to move
[1:04:50] <%segonian> Jesus
[1:04:53] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Elena freaking the fuck out
[1:04:56] <leargo> it happens so much to so manny plataforms
[1:04:56] <+Noxybaru> When an "off-by-one error" leaks your consumer financials

[1:05:02] <Dio_TR> @ElenaManetta it was Christmas for someone i tell you what
[1:05:03] <DocMadfox> Or a prepaid card
[1:05:04] <MajesticSundew> Do not ever use paypal of anything
[1:05:05] <OwlLightningMage> Just never go online
[1:05:06] <Ir_ramble> Fucking Russian Hackers
[1:05:07] <%spiritofmojave> PSN is almost as susceptible as Steam
[1:05:07] <InugamiTheHound> geohot hacked the ps3 and leaked everyone account info.
[1:05:08] <%ElenaManetta> apatCanada
[1:05:09] <RoboXGP> paypal does that too
[1:05:10] <OwlLightningMage> Problem sovled
[1:05:11] <%Shadowthedigger> Especially since that's a weird ass glitch and everything with Epic has been this that should be basic security.
[1:05:13] <Gorgen> remember when PSN was down for 4 months
[1:05:13] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> playstation spent 3 months down once
[1:05:13] <dagrum> paypal LUL
[1:05:15] <+Dorf1> shadow the WHAT
[1:05:15] <+ArmaIy> shadow the what?
[1:05:17] <$PaleBloodInk> Or don't save your card info.
[1:05:18] <emillionghost> paypal sucks
[1:05:18] <MajesticSundew> PayPal is the fucking worst of them all
[1:05:19] <InfraRedRidingHood_> atpCarl
[1:05:20] <%Prevot> >paypal
[1:05:23] <+Noxybaru> Sony actually stored the passwords hashed but unsalted. Which is still pretty bad
[1:05:30] <FunkyStreams> they are all the exact fucking same
[1:05:33] <%PalmtopNami> @pimpinahz you are joking right?
[1:05:34] <%Cavumentum> Remember to always delete your payment information, once got hacked and lost $200 to someone who got into my Epic account and ever since I have almost exclusively used PayPal
[1:05:37] <%ItsRatman> Has there ever been any sort of online service that HASNT had a data breach?
[1:05:37] <%ElenaManetta> Isn't it just typical ____ wars
[1:05:41] <%dukenux> no id rather bank than paypal
[1:05:42] <$RubberFistFight> @Noxybaru at one point they saved them as plaintext.
[1:05:43] <%puhff> apatJpeg
[1:05:44] <stabbityrabbit> DIGGER. Oh jesus I thought Pat let his Wakka show.
[1:05:44] <thegreenbenis> Play My Summer Car.
[1:05:44] <%FrustratedAF> give pat your 16 digit credit card number, the expiration date, and those wacky security numbers on the back Kappa
[1:05:47] <$valriot> Theyre not, they are all fuckin stupid
[1:05:47] <pimpinahz> @palmtopnami yes I am lol
[1:05:48] <%Shadowthedigger> None of these other platforms are using buying exclusives to cover for that though.
[1:05:48] <+wwwwwww1> and while likey using stuff like discord, google, etc that absolutely do farm your data
[1:05:49] <gustavozxd> @ElenaManetta 100% yes
[1:05:51] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I just refuse to use epic cause what they did with metro exodus royally pissed me off.
[1:05:51] <+Noxybaru> @RubberFistFight oof
[1:05:53] <%FrustratedAF> jesus there's gonna be infinite more
[1:05:53] <%Bladeexe> PayPal almost made my brother lose a good chunk of his money.
[1:05:54] <yourliteraldog> YEET YEET
[1:05:54] <Rawpost> !uptime
[1:05:55] <KatabolicRage> Epic just needs to stop being shit, basic features should've been in place BEFORE they started throwing money to force people onto their platform
[1:05:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 5m.
[1:05:55] <DomunDomunDomun> Not even verifying email is a whole different level of incompetence.
[1:05:56] <alwayspronking> Consistency?
[1:05:57] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Imma be level by bias is steam supports linux gaming, and that's the only real reason.

[1:07:00] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat the problem is, hardly anybody argues in good faith these days, making your attempts to do so that much more difficult AND that much more likely to fail. You and Paige should be familiar with that, given the Twitter shit you're forced to deal with on a regular basis.

I love how pat makes me seem crazier by his inability to read or piece together my messages. He thought i was asking whether he preferred mario kart or smash, rather than think the back to back messages were one continuous message. you all also notice he sometimes does this quiet pause just before he reads my shit sometimes? Makes me think the stream breaks.

[1:20:41] <%deviljhojho94> kuei jin are fucking aliens
[1:20:41] <reiju_22> which mouse is that?
[1:20:45] <%TeraMercier> Worst part about playing Skyrim as a vampire was that it just turns off like half your regeneration and other magics during the day, the more convenient time to see things while playing

[1:20:51] <yourliteraldog> @Valentinius_Anodyne whats the distinction?
[1:20:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Jiang-shi are "hopping vampires" that feed off of chi like Hsien-ko.
[1:20:56] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Relentless revenant Jiangshi
[1:20:56] <%deviljhojho94> actually juei jin are GHOST aliens
[1:20:59] <gustavozxd> I use Q for holster
[1:21:01] <PKHTjim> Was there ever a Hunter: The Reckoning game back then?
[1:21:01] <%TeraMercier> @AngriestPat I think someone said Q isn't bound
[1:21:02] <PSI_Guy95> secondary attack is swapping modes on guns
[1:21:03] <%SolidusRex> H is for Holster
[1:21:10] <gustavozxd> @AngriestPat you can tap left and right when you run so you can run faster
[1:21:11] <+EdenOfLove> pat you get badass guns and even a sword later on, you should reconsider using the 8 damage per hit magic weapon
[1:21:16] <PSI_Guy95> like scoping or fanning a revolver (not the shitty default one)

[1:22:13] <%apostateCourier> Talky skills are useful
[1:22:13] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Firearms get good way later, go magic
[1:22:13] <KatabolicRage> skill books man
[1:22:14] <OwlLightningMage> Big beef time PogChamp
[1:22:15] <KatabolicRage> you used books
[1:22:15] <Dehlome> you want to be able to access everything you can as you come across it
[1:22:16] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You read a skill book
[1:22:16] <+nictron90> Guns get really good later, but the early ones are absolute trash
[1:22:18] <+Gohyakuen> BLoOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[1:22:18] <+nexus152> you got a book
[1:22:19] <Ner234> I've never played this game. Are all builds viable or are there some that are definitely shit?
[1:22:19] <%thegostofjon> you got those gun books
[1:22:19] <%Cavumentum> Okay but why when you could MAGIC
[1:22:19] <PowerfulBlackGangs> You read a book
[1:22:20] <i_worship_his_shadow> all into computa skills
[1:22:20] <RupanSen> Guns are bad until late game
[1:22:20] <+risenchudjr> persuasion is also good
[1:22:21] <LtSergei> buy perception instead of fire arms
[1:22:22] <FrenchTact1cs> RUSH IT
[1:22:22] <+ArmaIy> Books increase your stats
[1:22:22] <Patzzki217> you got it from the skill book
[1:22:22] <ShichiNoBushi> Read a book.
[1:22:23] <%Laecerelius> Pat, you read two books on how to gun
[1:22:23] <PKHTjim> Firearms was a skillbook.
[1:22:23] <SchlongKongEduardo> scholarship
[1:22:23] <%manwithboxonhead> Def Jam Fight for Los Angeles Kindred Edition
[1:22:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat don't rush Thaumaturgy or you will fail all the sidequests.
[1:22:26] <Graniteflight2014> Bllod boil is an "I win" button against everything but the last bosses
[1:22:26] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Scholarship for MORE BOOKS
[1:22:26] <chrissechrist> hey what race of vampire is Pat?
[1:22:27] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @yourliteraldog They're more like the Risen, if you're familiar with Wraith: the Oblivion. They run on Chi, which is a whole other thing in-universe
[1:22:27] <%apostateCourier> Scholarship's the big one iirc
[1:22:28] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Guns are great late game, shitty early game
[1:22:29] <%Kavtech> waOwaOwaOwaO
[1:22:29] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Thaumaturgy will get you through combat. Brawl is good for feeding. Other than those two you need a lot more social.
[1:22:30] <aazv17> @AngriestPat You read a book on guns that raised your gun skill
[1:22:30] <Rusflex> @AngriestPat raise charisma
[1:22:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> good idea
[1:22:33] <DracaenaLeaf> That's the right option
[1:22:33] <starotter70> Good choice
[1:22:34] <Demon_chann> blood purge + guns melt everything in seconds
[1:22:34] <RiffRaff1138> @AngriestPat Strength and Brawl allow you to feed on people more easily in combat
[1:22:36] <mr_slaide> Do it, nerd.
[1:22:37] <byobuer> that's future pat's problem
[1:22:37] <gustavozxd> early guns bad, later guns good, yep that's pretty much it
[1:22:38] <a_mad_dragon> SeemsGood
[1:22:39] <+drakthebest> Physical stats do not matter because blood buffs will ALWAYS raise your stats to 5
[1:22:40] <%SolidusRex> You won't need good stats for what's next.
[1:22:40] <nekodelic> ranged sucks in this game @angriestpat
[1:22:40] <%TeraMercier> Always good to have a backup like gun in case you run out of blood mp
[1:22:44] <+drakthebest> Physical stats are completely useless as a result
[1:22:46] <%PharosOfLight> @AngriestPat you can get free brawl points later if yours is low when you reach that point
[1:22:46] <+ChestMimik> Can't put points in bad skills if you don't use points
[1:22:47] <%ElenaManetta> What's a Di-er
[1:22:49] <%SpcOpsBear> DO THE GHOST ONE
[1:22:49] <%deviljhojho94> @AngriestPat Guns and persuasion are a great investment. Thaumaturgy is great too, but is a bad idea to rush it early game
[1:22:49] <+EdenOfLove> just saying if you get one more point in ranged you will be much happier with it
[1:22:50] <$nademonkey1100> Put a point into DICK SUCKING
[1:22:50] <%ElenaManetta> apatJpeg
[1:22:50] <%spiritofmojave> Saving for them is always valid
[1:22:52] <Desertfishing> he should put points into something he wont use
[1:22:53] <pimpinahz> put all your points in barter LUL
[1:22:55] <DracaenaLeaf> Ranged gun is only good for the final boss
[1:22:58] <+drakthebest> Guns also do nothing against vampires
[1:22:58] <LtSergei> no, ranged is the best
[1:22:59] <starotter70> Persuation
[1:23:02] <KatabolicRage> who the hell is saying ranged sucks, it doesn't suck
[1:23:04] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Ranged sucks until late game, then it's godlike
[1:23:04] <%dukenux> SUCC D
[1:23:05] <a1u5> Ranged is literally only good for the final battle
[1:23:06] <KeystoneA1> Ranged is fine
[1:23:07] <LtSergei> but not on a tremere
[1:23:07] <%SolidusRex> Have brawl no higher than 2
[1:23:07] <Dhurkst> depends on the gun
[1:23:08] <%TeraMercier> Persuasion seems the most verstile
[1:23:08] <%mh9s> ranged gets good late game
[1:23:09] <Demon_chann> ranged is pretty good for tremeres
[1:23:09] <RoboXGP> get on that dick, work the corner
[1:23:09] <candidateplays> Ranged is amazing nearer the end of the game, when you get a bunch of cool guns
[1:23:09] <+schelmpki> @AngriestPat brawl is useful for combat feeding .
[1:23:09] <MajesticSundew> Shotguns are good against vampires
[1:23:09] <Archmortal> Blood magic + guns is the true and correct path, but if you wanna do things besides murder
[1:23:11] <+nexus152> ranged literal worst skill in the game
[1:23:11] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Ranged + the AUG is handy
[1:23:12] <A_Red_Robot> Ranged is good on Celerity builds
[1:23:12] <mr_slaide> Pat, you're going to get idiots contradicting themselves every 5 minutes here...
[1:23:14] <%spiritofmojave> I thought ranged was decent for most endgame shit
[1:23:15] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Ranged is better later in the game
[1:23:15] <RutlerTheButler> the first gun is shit
[1:23:15] <AlasterAngelo> ranged is fine but as a tremere you don't care
[1:23:17] <aazv17> Ranged is good but in later half of game
[1:23:17] <Atheistpreacher> How far is Pat?
[1:23:17] <RutlerTheButler> later guns are fine
[1:23:18] <PSI_Guy95> Brawl lets you feed on people easier
[1:23:20] <%Freelance7> Ghost House
[1:23:21] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat Physical stats do not matter because blood buffs will ALWAYS raise your stats to 5
[1:23:26] <+asasqw> @AngriestPat The ability to mass blood vomit works on most bosses
[1:23:26] <+nexus152> 5
[1:23:26] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Fine as isd
[1:23:26] <Dhurkst> shotguns are very good
[1:23:26] <%thegostofjon> put all your points in finance and become a vampire tax adjuster
[1:23:26] <%deviljhojho94> brawl is gimick
[1:23:27] <%IDTheftVictim> Every play style is valid
[1:23:30] <AlasterAngelo> Tremere rush magic you'll kill everything
[1:23:32] <KeystoneA1> 3 and above
[1:23:33] <Ah_Ping> is this massive attack
[1:23:34] <LtSergei> if you incapacitate an enemy you can feed on them
[1:23:35] <%spiritofmojave> At 3+
[1:23:38] <LtSergei> use dominate to feed instead
[1:23:38] <MachigattaLT> @drakthebest depends on if hes using patch plus or not
[1:23:39] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Strong enemies are harder to eat
[1:23:40] <gustavozxd> idk man i went gun only my first run and it made the game eeeeeaaasssyyy
[1:23:41] <%TeraMercier> Combat feeding seems like perfect synergy with blood magic
[1:23:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Your unarmed is fine tbh.
[1:23:43] <%IDTheftVictim> It's an opposed roll I think
[1:23:44] <+nexus152> brawl is the best
[1:23:44] <RupanSen> you don't need both brawl and melee
[1:23:45] <+theneosloth> you dont need brawl, you can just use dominate
[1:23:45] <+valkuma> not that bad. its more about if you get hit while feeding on someone
[1:23:46] <Dhurkst> higher as the game goes on
[1:23:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Ranged is okay, Intimidation is actual worst stat
[1:23:46] <Peculiar_Pangolin> You really don't need brawl unless you're going unarmed
[1:23:48] <%ClutchRoadagain> Wow, Pat is actually way earlier into this game than I thought.

Hey pat, pick one: 3ds dies for good, right now, no more support, but melee gets support, and new gamecubes and crtvs till the end of time. That or the inverse. Melee dies instantly, and newer 3ds models continue to be produced alongside the switch and all Nintendo successor systems till the end of time. I'm slowly losing all respect I had for the fighter. I tell him demon can insta kill him. He still wants to fight it.

[1:46:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 That fire in the kitchen should have been a bigger deal. This game underplays it hard. In the tabletop, exposure to a mere candle for 1 turn deals 1 aggravated damage, which takes 5 vitae and 2 nights to heal.

[1:48:09] <gustavozxd> @ithirstforfreddurst why? i don't even know what it adds cause i didn't find any mod list, what does it do that is bad?
[1:48:10] <ShinTeach> blindfully skilled
[1:48:10] <TwinBat> pat is used to staring down
[1:48:12] <Matermind0> Anyone else play Antribu? Was that as much of a mess as I remember

[1:51:31] <InugamiTheHound> will pat play the final fantasy XV DLC?
[1:51:31] <Croetec> Because you didn't headphone in the dark
[1:51:32] <goddamndavid> these sewers are really illuminated
[1:51:32] <sappinmahbinyot> Is Pat using a graphics mod?
[1:51:33] <+Bupkis7> fuck you
[1:51:34] <+zeegaming> Can’t wait for pat to fuck this next part up
[1:51:35] <Badgerconda_> Pat, I think you're actually lacking a soul.
[1:51:36] <+yasahiro1011> This game is big scary when you're younger
[1:51:36] <a1u5> You did blow through it pretty quickly
[1:51:36] <worldbrand> I dunno why we did that, pat's been through 7 shitstorms
[1:51:36] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Is this game the good jank or the bad jank?
[1:51:37] <%Keyd00d> No it was cool fuck you
[1:51:37] <+Grayhammatter> a big hype
[1:51:38] <CandideCamera> Yeah because you already played through it dummy
[1:51:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I mean It was neat I guess?
[1:51:39] <ShinTeach> hey, it aged
[1:51:40] <valachi> Because you're fucking blind, Pat.
[1:51:41] <%JenovasPuppet> You've played it before!
[1:51:41] <%waifoong98> I didn't hype it, don't blame me LUL
[1:51:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it was pretty cool
[1:51:42] <DSD24> Its still pretty cool
[1:51:42] <yourliteraldog> I was expecting a gay bathhouse
[1:51:42] <%spiritofmojave> That mansion was the shit, but I have rose-colored glasses I confess
[1:51:42] <MakeshiftSurgeon> It was pretty awesome 15 years ago... :-\
[1:51:42] <zamzoph> wait, was there a resolution, or did he just leave?
[1:51:42] <MajesticSundew> There's a horror mission later on that's a lot better in my opinion
[1:51:44] <PhantaniumOG> The atmosphere is just great thats all
[1:51:47] <Twon_From_Wakanda> It was great for its time
[1:51:47] <DracaenaLeaf> ignote
[1:51:48] <%FrustratedAF> damn this is quite the audience
[1:51:48] <%Verd_254> You're goofy stream man, it ruined the mood
[1:51:48] <gustavozxd> look man i was 14 when i did this shit i was scared
[1:51:50] <%unclekulikov> unclekulikov subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:51:51] <Archmortal> You had to be there 10 years ago before atmospheric horror found its stride in games
[1:51:53] <%El_Desperad0> Chat always blue balling
[1:51:53] <%daisyyyy> Pat you ignored half the story
[1:51:54] <$nademonkey1100> we hype fucking everything up dont you know that '
[1:51:56] <%deviljhojho94> it was phenomenal back in the day
[1:51:58] <%ElenaManetta> How many 20+ year old horror games still hold up with their scares? Silent Hill is one of the few. Even original RE is not as scary.
[1:52:00] <+risenchudjr> this was great back in the day
[1:52:00] <xIgnitionCrowx> so when's thief deadly shadows?
[1:52:01] <Mr_Strut> Malk mansion is pretty good
[1:52:01] <+ShadowArcangel> I mean, you set yourself to dissapointment =P
[1:52:02] <+yasahiro1011> it's hype time
[1:52:03] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, that's a pretty expensive lighting cost for a sewer where people don't spend much time except for maintenance
[1:52:04] <%spiritofmojave> Us boomers love it
[1:52:04] <aazv17> Great atmosphere but there are scarier sections later
[1:52:04] <rytisone> 15
[1:52:04] <RupanSen> 15
[1:52:06] <%FrustratedAF> this is totally not a blind LP Kappa
[1:52:06] <Covil91> It's better than any horror game I ever played.
[1:52:06] <%AlastorSlain> @AngriestPat for a lot of people it was thier first taste of a set piece like that
[1:52:06] <%Cthulos> any spooky Japanese ghosts in this?
[1:52:08] <+absolute_cagemony> 20 years!
[1:52:08] <Mnightshyamallama> Pat you have to remember that this came out in 2004

[1:52:10] <starotter70> Crab Nipple
[1:52:10] <Erektionsite> The later horror mission is just super boring and far too long, atleast the one in hollywood
[1:52:11] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @PhantaniumOG well yeah, but when you said 'atmosphere' I thought you meant scary, not cheesey
[1:52:11] <%Piemen99> DAMN IT'S OLDER THEN ME a
[1:52:11] <+ChestMimik> But can you seduce the ghosts
[1:52:11] <%devo_mension> cheer100

[1:52:13] <%Keyd00d> crab nipple
[1:52:13] <%laazybulbasaur> Is it really?
[1:52:13] <+theneosloth> that mission is pretty cool in the context of you playing as an immortal vampire who can murder everything
[1:52:13] <Gorgen> crab nipple
[1:52:13] <+ProfessorDetective052996> Fifteen, but yeah.
[1:52:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Where's he going?
[1:52:14] <+yasahiro1011> Crab nipple
[1:52:16] <ithirstforfreddurst> 20 is just 15 rounded

[1:52:27] <$saturnianocean> I think the snuff stuff in Hollywood is scarier
[1:52:27] <%waifoong98> LUL
[1:52:27] <+yasahiro1011> Taste like nipple, walk like Crab

[1:52:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 And then there's Rötschreck, the Red Fear. The phobia of fire and sunlight is super real. You have to roll to avoid losing your shit from a lit cigarette. That kitchen fire should have had you inconsolably screaming in the corner trying to claw through the walls.
[1:52:35] <alrobot2014> 15 is not 20 years pat

[2:08:56] <Archmortal> it's not that he's giving you less, it's that he doesn't give much because he's not healthy
[2:08:56] <StromkoPenguin> You should drop off some healthy food for him, donuts and coffee aren't replenishing the blood

[2:31:04] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat You also need persuade 4

[2:31:20] <+ShadowArcangel> you called Jeanette a crazy bitch in an earlier quest, I think you can't save them both anymore
[2:31:20] <+countgaculatv> You need 4 points in persuasion
[2:31:21] <Chester_goes_Berserk> It's kinda a 2nd playthrough thing to save both
[2:31:22] <derekwst3> i would just walk away
[2:31:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Its not incest if their Vampires

[2:32:30] <Yeajow> 1
[2:32:32] <ooblag> It's a point system across all of your interactions. You don't need Seduction
[2:32:32] <jijipose> @AngriestPat If you could save them you would have gotten a persuasion prompt early on in the conversation, you probably weren't nice enough to one of them in an earlier conversation.
[2:32:33] <%Mekhet09> NO.
[2:32:33] <+risenchudjr> NO you DONT
[2:32:34] <%deviljhojho94> YOU DONT NEED SEDUCTION

[2:32:38] <MajesticSundew> You need to redo the whole quest line to get the good ending
[2:32:39] <+MrMcCrabby> its too late to do the seduction route
[2:32:39] <Archmortal> Seduction is NOT necessary
[2:32:39] <NickHatesSnow> You messed one up
[2:32:39] <%spiritofmojave> IT'S PERSUASION
[2:32:39] <DracaenaLeaf> yeah

[2:34:54] <starotter70> It's the best social skill
[2:34:54] <%apostateCourier> Persuasion at 4 is sufficient for this
[2:34:54] <KatabolicRage> scholarship helps you with book learnin
[2:34:54] <DarkOmen98> never stick your willie in crazy
[2:34:55] <%MagickBurritoh> Pump that seduction up
[2:34:57] <ooblag> Scholarship is great
[2:34:59] <%deviljhojho94> sScholarship is good

[2:35:10] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Increase your Dominance, it's a win condition against bosses, stun them and then stealth kill
[2:35:11] <DracaenaLeaf> How did you get 3 experience for Jeanette killing terese?

[2:35:14] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @manwithboxonhead like does the club actually go bust in story?
[2:35:18] <%mercado94> wat
[2:35:18] <+countgaculatv> You probably needed more Seduction for Jeanette to get her good side
[2:35:18] <%madhattergay> scholarship and chorizo
[2:35:19] <$Slimshazbot> persuade is by far the best followed by seduction then intimidate
[2:35:19] <%dukenux> S(ed)ucction
[2:35:20] <KatabolicRage> persuade is best, seduction has it's uses for getting free blood, intimidate is niche as hell

[2:37:12] <gustavozxd> the safety of LA at night
[2:37:12] <%TIME_PUNCHER> "Safety" where all those syringes are
[2:37:12] <NickHatesSnow> Skill point are consumable
[2:37:13] <+countgaculatv> Or use console commands
[2:37:14] <Acrimon> Finance is financially sound
[2:37:17] <%manwithboxonhead> Going to get my smokes
[2:37:19] <byobuer> scholarship is also persuasion?
[2:37:20] <rytisone> Max charisma is mask dancing with the police
[2:37:21] <derekwst3> skill points are a limited consumable
[2:37:23] <OwlLightningMage> Why does Pat always listening to that one wrong person LUL
[2:37:26] <KatabolicRage> blue is because it's getting a buff from something
[2:37:27] <$hatesdps> cuz buff?
[2:37:27] <KeystoneA1> Because of the buff item
[2:37:28] <MajesticSundew> You have a bonus to it
[2:37:29] <KatabolicRage> your stick
[2:37:29] <Erektionsite> You have the item
[2:37:29] <LtSergei> because you have the item with buff
[2:37:30] <%mh9s> you have an item modifying it
[2:37:30] <Tampaoster> Finance you'll Need it later
[2:37:30] <count_bob> You maxed it out.
[2:37:30] <Covil91> the item
[2:37:30] <PhantaniumOG> The item boosting it
[2:37:30] <Superblooms> pretty sure you never see jeanette again, do you.
[2:37:30] <DracaenaLeaf> the stic
[2:37:31] <randomp141> Because you have armor on.
[2:37:31] <%SolidusRex> Your occult item
[2:37:31] <BigCoffee> the buff itme
[2:37:31] <+DrPoxx> Specialization is king in this game
[2:37:31] <ooblag> It means there's a modifier affecting it
[2:37:31] <StromkoPenguin> It's buffed by the artifact from the hotel
[2:37:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Buffed by magic item
[2:37:32] <$Slimshazbot> because of that root
[2:37:32] <Them00n> You have an item that buffs it.
[2:37:33] <gustavozxd> blue is because of the item
[2:37:33] <+sourceofall> you have a bonus to it
[2:37:33] <ミュウレ4242> because you have the magic stick.
[2:37:33] <+Dives__> It's buffed
[2:37:34] <aazv17> It's buffed by the branch
[2:37:35] <+risenchudjr> Because you have an item that buffs it - remember the thistle?
[2:37:36] <AlasterAngelo> Therese and Jeanette put together is Tourette
[2:37:39] <+ShadowArcangel> the item that you got
[2:37:39] <BeagleCypher> From buffs.
[2:37:39] <Mnightshyamallama> you got the stick to increase defense
[2:37:40] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat If you were a vampire, would you no longer fear syringe-wielding maniacs?
[2:37:42] <DracaenaLeaf> Yes
[2:37:44] <%spiritofmojave> something modifying it to +1
[2:37:49] <KeystoneA1> no
[2:37:50] <ooblag> Naw
[2:37:51] <+MrMcCrabby> no
[2:37:52] <BigCoffee> no
[2:37:52] <Them00n> No
[2:37:52] <%Gogogolem> NO!
[2:37:53] <LtSergei> not right now
[2:37:53] <derekwst3> no
[2:37:54] <+neo_cosmos> just to let you know pat combat will not be avoidable late game for main story and most side story stuff so you will need to get some sort of combat skill
[2:37:54] <+zaworldo> bOOST UNARMED
[2:37:54] <gustavozxd> melee is awful
[2:37:54] <randomp141> YES
[2:37:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG MELEE
[2:37:55] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[2:37:55] <+risenchudjr> no, go brawl only
[2:37:55] <+theneosloth> no
[2:37:55] <KatabolicRage> you already have a point of brawl and two in firearms
[2:37:56] <+EdenOfLove> yessss
[2:37:56] <Demon_chann> guns
[2:37:57] <LtSergei> save your points for now
[2:37:58] <JackalKing> Your magic isn't maxed, therefor its not good
[2:37:59] <%AncelDeLambert> no, melee sucks
[2:37:59] <Megapikman132> Seems like a waste
[2:37:59] <Covil91> Guns OR melee, never both
[2:38:00] <NickHatesSnow> no
[2:38:00] <%JenovasPuppet> Not if you're gunning
[2:38:01] <+ShadowArcangel> brawl or melee
[2:38:01] <LtSergei> you can level up any time
[2:38:02] <Tampaoster> Finance will be very usefull
[2:38:03] <+EdenOfLove> guns or melee
[2:38:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh Noes its happening
[2:38:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> scholarship
[2:38:04] <$hatesdps> i would take a melee, guns are finite items pat
[2:38:07] <ooblag> For combat you want GUNS
[2:38:07] <BigCoffee> guns or melee, not both
[2:38:07] <mrgrimsmiles> invest in stealth powers
[2:38:08] <derekwst3> boost dominance
[2:38:08] <Archmortal> Brawl is better than Melee for Tremere, but GUN is better than both
[2:38:08] <AlasterAngelo> magic's all you need
[2:38:08] <KeystoneA1> Don't forget Brawl and Dodge
[2:38:09] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Melee is garbage
[2:38:10] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat melee because VASTLY underpowered late-game
[2:38:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Scholarship before charisma
[2:38:13] <Them00n> scholarship is good though
[2:38:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Its happening, the min max is beginning
[2:38:13] <mrgrimsmiles> always stealth powers
[2:38:14] <natebud> You already have points in gun, just need better guns
[2:38:16] <%spiritofmojave> Magic or guns if you ask me
[2:38:18] <nekodelic> guns suck in this game
[2:38:20] <gustavozxd> melee is probably good for other clans but definetly not tremere
[2:38:20] <ShichiNoBushi> That red jacket guy was freaking out.
[2:38:20] <aazv17> Use guns and magic imo
[2:38:23] <randomp141> Pat get the asian vamp yet?
[2:38:25] <KatabolicRage> guns only suck for the first zone man
[2:38:25] <ミュウレ4242> brawl works w/ your blood shield well, but some of the weapons are cool.
[2:38:27] <aazv17> guns are bad at first though
[2:38:29] <+MrMcCrabby> you could consider putting enough points to meet the requirment for the knife, if you want to use the knife
[2:38:32] <LtSergei> don't get scholarship
[2:38:32] <DracaenaLeaf> yeah @randomp141
[2:38:37] <aazv17> but they are really good later in the game
[2:38:38] <gustavozxd> guns are godlike later on
[2:38:39] <KatabolicRage> it boosts two things, just take it
[2:38:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea
[2:38:42] <heybenice> Side quest time?
[2:38:43] <LtSergei> you get a free scholarship 3 from dialogue
[2:38:46] <Therazgrizsnake> XP points are consumable items, save them Kappa
[2:38:46] <randomp141> Ah good, that thing's fun to fight.
[2:38:49] <LtSergei> but not 4
[2:38:50] <BigCoffee> guns are broken later on + cool factor
[2:38:53] <MajesticSundew> Scholarship is fine
[2:38:54] <+risenchudjr> You get free scholarship 3 later
[2:38:54] <derekwst3> school is for losers
[2:38:55] <SmellyIdol> You get scholarship 3 for free
[2:38:56] <DracaenaLeaf> it's fine imo
[2:38:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat If you leave scholarship at 2 you get it free.
[2:39:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh
[2:39:06] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Scholarship is for NEEEEERDS
[2:39:07] <count_bob> Are you guys sure?
[2:39:09] <%JenovasPuppet> How far away is the free point?
[2:39:10] <LtSergei> yes
[2:39:11] <+Afrobrawler> yes
[2:39:11] <starotter70> No
[2:39:11] <natebud> Save it for when you need it
[2:39:11] <Tampaoster> FInance pat you will need it for FAT LARRY
[2:39:12] <%tizz86> cha is a hard stat and scholar is situational
[2:39:12] <ShichiNoBushi> But cheaper to buy low.
[2:39:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No
[2:39:13] <Dr_Mooose> no
[2:39:13] <Triox45> wouldn't that be nice
[2:39:14] <gustavozxd> where do you get scholarship 3?
[2:39:15] <%spiritofmojave> Sometimes
[2:39:17] <alwayspronking> I don't know. Isn't it Pat?
[2:39:18] <Dao_Puppy> maybe
[2:39:19] <mayorrev> yes
[2:39:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat If you listen to me Pat I will teach you how to do the big scumbag free skill points.
[2:39:22] <KatabolicRage> bertrum is a coolguy

[2:40:53] <%TeraMercier> They're the lemmings of these nerds
[2:41:00] <mayorrev> crosses his arms and laughs

[2:41:03] <+ProfessorDetective052996> We're all Evil, but they're CHAOTIC Evil.
[2:41:04] <Erektionsite> Bertram is the strongest AND coolest Nos in the whole gamr
[2:41:04] <%manwithboxonhead> @maihusbando9s It is a cool name.
[2:41:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 Optimal XP routing in this game is insane. Timing the prereqs for everything alongside all the freebies. If you're gonna do a 2nd playthrough, for Malk or whatever, try the guide for big OCD and power.
[2:41:07] <yourliteraldog> He looks a melted action figure
[2:41:10] <%TIME_PUNCHER> You know, I'm less surprised that this guy fucks. Vergil though? That's weird.
[2:41:11] <derekwst3> summon exodia
[2:41:17] <yourliteraldog> Sabbat?
[2:41:23] <yourliteraldog> Are they evil
[2:41:25] <InugamiTheHound> super ugly
[2:41:27] <%DK_Rance> man whens the game where i can be werewolves instead BibleThump
[2:41:27] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You'll want to save it till after you plant the bomb
[2:41:30] <derekwst3> your evil
[2:41:34] <natebud> But where to buy ammo?
[2:41:35] <fairore> ah he said it
[2:41:38] <AlasterAngelo> @dk
[2:41:38] <$RubberFistFight> This guy's head looks like a forest mushroom that grows on trees
[2:41:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat If you plant the bomb without being seen once, you get bonus XP
[2:41:40] <Triox45> why would anyone tolerate the Sabbat like this, I never understood it
[2:41:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah, you said YOU can but what about me
[2:41:46] <AlasterAngelo> @DK_Rance i'm sure there's a furry game in the works
[2:41:52] <leroypi> Is that D Bradley Baker?
[2:41:58] <%manwithboxonhead> OH yeah I took bomb armament class in community college.
[2:41:59] <energywarning> i wonder if he has starcraft on that computer
[2:41:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Triox45 This game is a very inaccurate depiction of the Sabbat.
[2:41:59] <%Kavtech> @Triox45 They don't?
[2:42:04] <Erektionsite> I feel like the sabbat is kinda done dirty in this game
[2:42:06] <natebud> @Triox45 At this point it just seems like there's too many to exterminate
[2:42:07] <KatabolicRage> the sabbat are actually very discrete in their own cities
[2:42:13] <LtSergei> @Triox45 they're way too powerful to just eradicate
[2:42:14] <heybenice> Side quest time?
[2:42:16] <InugamiTheHound> @AlasterAngelo what furry game?
[2:42:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Don't believe the Camarilla's lies. Sabbat are your friends.
[2:42:20] <%DK_Rance> @AlastorSlain cause its like to most vapmires i prefer werewolves or if its the kinda vamp that turns into like a bestial bat thing ya know ?
[2:42:20] <$RubberFistFight> INVISIDICK
[2:42:21] <%brakkathoom> Sabbat are vampires that cast aside the trappings of "humanity". Sort of a survival of the fittest cult with some catholic flavoring.
[2:42:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Morality in VtMB: Everyone is varying shades of Evil on the Evil spectrum. Gray is considered Saintly.
[2:42:21] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Is this your first time through this game?

[2:43:24] <kingra> GUNS?
[2:43:27] <derekwst3> i miss chunk
[2:43:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In the setting, the Sabbat aren't too powerful to be snuffed out at all. It's just there's a lot of them and the Anarchs have no problem with them in general.
[2:43:32] <+neo_cosmos> did pat do the bounty hunting stuff yet?
[2:43:33] <+PenmanLupine> Mercurio is the best
[2:43:34] <+risenchudjr> He'll be back soon
[2:43:35] <rytisone> WHY'D HE BITE ME
[2:43:37] <randomp141> @AngriestPat He won't have decent guns till after you bomb the wherehouse.
[2:43:40] <$RubberFistFight> @TIME_PUNCHER wait, who is Jensen Ackles in this?
[2:43:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In fact, in the setting Sabbat are the underdogs.
[2:43:42] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat He'll be better after you finish the warehouse.
[2:43:43] <aazv17> The morphine takes time in the story to work
[2:43:45] <natebud> It's been like a day in reality
[2:43:46] <missingangle> No but give him more
[2:43:46] <a1u5> It's still the same night, it's TOTALLY reasonable he'd still be fucked up
[2:43:46] <DracaenaLeaf> soon isn't right lol
[2:43:53] <+countgaculatv> @derekwst3 Chunk misses that triple stack baconator
[2:43:56] <+Tr1pkT12> Are YOU high as fuck Pat?
[2:43:58] <%dukenux> lotsa guns
[2:43:58] <randomp141> @AngriestPat And even then you need to do at least one quest before he actually has it
[2:43:58] <ScreamingMeat> Bruh
[2:43:59] <%ElenaManetta> Your face can bypass the security mesh
[2:44:00] <+Nanocomputer> yo @RubberFistFight what?
[2:44:02] <%SolidusRex> Remember: the man on the couch is one of two people you can TRUST
[2:44:02] <%FrustratedAF> so vampire dicks, am i right?
[2:44:03] <mrgrimsmiles> im think your going to need to stock up on blood
[2:44:05] <Them00n> Buy those books
[2:44:05] <mojokingizakku> is that bam margira?
[2:44:09] <gustavozxd> the good guns start showing up around the level after this one
[2:44:14] <%ElenaManetta> Holy fuck Pat is rich as balls
[2:44:16] <Run44forrest> this dude reminds me of dante from clerks
[2:44:24] <eldritchmoeblob> all of these people look like they were in stone temple pilots
[2:44:26] <+sixcubit> why does ARM have 9 lethality
[2:44:27] <AlasterAngelo> not dante from devil may cry?
[2:44:28] <$RubberFistFight> @Nanocomputer no idea, people were screaming about Jensen Ackles for some reason
[2:44:28] <+Tr1pkT12> HAHA
[2:44:29] <+countgaculatv> Gotta wait till the OTHER fat guy for better guns Pat
[2:44:32] <energywarning> is your shotgun worth less than lockpicks? how does that work?
[2:44:32] <spire6> ask him if he needs a hand 4Head
[2:44:38] <%daisyyyy> If the Sabbat weren't underdogs there'd be no Masquerade
[2:44:39] <starotter70> EAT THE MORPHINE
[2:44:43] <%spiritofmojave> $7 Utica, what a potential sell
[2:44:47] <+neo_cosmos> was hospital girl saved?
[2:44:47] <PinkSocks> You only have 1 lockpick
[2:44:49] <Erektionsite> Has he done the email sidequest?
[2:44:49] <Kief_Gringo> Reminds me of Bam Margera lol
[2:44:50] <LtSergei> you can dump a lot of your items into a cabinet in your house
[2:44:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> YO
[2:44:55] <+Tr1pkT12> Weed is legal in Canada right?
[2:44:59] <starotter70> @neo_cosmos Yup

[2:55:20] <%manwithboxonhead> Are you ready to become a fundamental terrorist?
[2:55:23] <mojokingizakku> this main character has gross vampire hands
[2:55:25] <gustavozxd> stealth AI is amazing in this game

[2:55:30] <+shinpete> Man a remake of this would be so sweet
[2:55:31] <haisho> the question is how broken? Is it Skyrim broken?
[2:55:39] <+theneosloth> more broken
[2:55:41] <%lewdskeletor13> If you’re bombing the place why would it matter if you’re killing people right? @angriestpat
[2:55:41] <KatabolicRage> any AI problems boil down to valve not letting them have the good source engine AI at the time
[2:55:42] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Ah yes, the vampire clan Loki
[2:55:44] <alexandrecau> restart the whole game
[2:55:46] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Sneaking is cool and all, but what about bullet jumping

[2:56:19] <Mr_Strut> Should've gone Malk. You could be INVISIBLE.
[2:56:22] <%ElenaManetta> Everytime you reload, I get this tiny clench in my stomach that the game is gonna load in jank and break and you'll have to reload again. It's like with Fallout, I'm ALWAYS worried after a load screen something will break.

[3:02:09] <@PeachSaliva> Oh no! Pat had a Redbull! He will most assuredly somehow die!!!

[3:05:29] <Dhurkst> @Kavtech I just meant that the world building gives a pretty good sense of how powerful vampires are & what they're capable of. Plus, this is based on a pen-&-paper RPG system, so things have to be rigidly codified.

[3:18:41] <pectusumbra> GOTTA TELL WAKKA

[3:18:44] <+Promessa_EX> or a gross one
[3:18:44] <KatabolicRage> you should check your emails sometimes by the way
[3:18:46] <ooblag> Problem with the Tremere is that they became Vampires by slurping a super powerful ancient Vampire, who 's probably still chilling inside their blood, able to take control at any moment
[3:18:47] <Dr_Mooose> he was into it
[3:18:47] <Gorgen> i hear its like a horses dick
[3:18:48] <Run44forrest> hot
[3:18:50] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Didn't you hear? He doesn't put his penis in, he gets pegged
[3:18:51] <PSI_Guy95> there's like 4 vampires in this area and you told all of them
[3:18:51] <+ShadowArcangel> Beckett doesn't care about politics
[3:18:52] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat , bruja significa 'Witch', idiota.
[3:18:52] <%brakkathoom> It's cool. Think it was supposed to be part of a later quest that never got made due to time constraints.

[3:19:07] <NumberTooBig> masaka
[3:19:08] <%SolidusRex> Don't worry about him

[3:41:02] <TreskM> btggf Kreygasm
[3:41:03] <%madhattergay> its the goth club from saints row
[3:41:03] <+DingusMcFadden> Just sweaty
[3:41:04] <+Estuko> Big Tiddy Goth BU'NESS
[3:41:05] <+EdenOfLove> Pat forget to buy guns. Make sad
[3:41:09] <%JenovasPuppet> Hey it's the apartment you can't have because you're a filthy blood mage
[3:41:15] <Ultimatefool> This is not accurate, there aren't 10000 cars on every street
[3:41:19] <arkv01> did someone say GOTH
[3:41:26] <arkv01> RISE GAMERss
[3:41:30] <%JenovasPuppet> That's the Nos path
[3:41:31] <Erektionsite> Go to hospital tho
[3:41:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game invented the big tiddy goth.
[3:41:33] <+ShadowArcangel> a place to hide from the popo if you need to
[3:41:35] <DSD24> Hey man Full Moon's out that means BLOODBENDING
[3:41:35] <aazv17> We live in a society
[3:41:35] <Dao_Puppy> Damn you STOP SIGN
[3:41:37] <natebud> probably for nosferatu stealth
[3:41:40] <overlordkog> Apparently there's another World of Darkness game in the works besides Bloodlines 2; Werewolf: The Apocalypse.
[3:41:42] <RiffRaff1138> @AngriestPat Go to Venture Tower and figuratively suck LaCroix's dick and he'll give you a safehouse in this neighborhood
[3:41:46] <+Estuko> The goth girl who works at Gamestop will never notice you
[3:41:48] <%AlastorSlain> VENTURE TOWER
[3:41:50] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> We live in a bottom text
[3:41:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RiffRaff1138 No he won't, that's after the Dane.
[3:41:56] <HweeWikk> what if you literally suck lacroix's dick
[3:41:59] <AlasterAngelo> @Estuko SHUT UP
[3:41:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> If VtMB 2 doesn't have Suicide Girls in the strip clubs, I'm going to be upset
[3:42:00] <+DingusMcFadden> Mmm, I could go for a cheese Coney, chat
[3:42:00] <KeystoneA1> The Tremere Chantry is a better safehouse
[3:42:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Everybody's memory sucks.
[3:42:02] <%SolidusRex> More like Ventrue Tower
[3:42:04] <ooblag> @RiffRaff1138 He's Tremere, he needs to suck a different metaphorical dick
[3:42:14] <randomp141> Who let this orange blob on the controls??? He can't figure out where to go.
[3:42:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Estuko who the fuck are all these lucky people with Goth Girls working their gamestops?
[3:42:15] <%nikoloas_> nikoloas_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[3:42:36] <RiffRaff1138> @Too_Much_Nukie Really? Coulda sworn he'd give it in the first interaction. Been a while since I played this tho.
[3:42:37] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat This building can get buggy as all fuck. Be sure to save before you enter here.
[3:42:39] <Run44forrest> please dont hit on the gamestop cashiers chat
[3:42:39] <natebud> LA noire taught him that
[3:42:40] <%spiritofmojave> why is everyone talking about that mythical game 'store'
[3:42:40] <DracaenaLeaf> incoming creep
[3:42:44] <%spiritofmojave> that doesn't exist
[3:42:48] <starotter70> Oh this shit is creepy af
[3:42:48] <+logoth_> I go to gamestop to exploit deals and their policy.
[3:42:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @EdenOfLove He has no firearms skill and you get both those guns for free very soon.
[3:42:50] <DSD24> Put ya GUNS ON
[3:42:51] <+EdenOfLove> but the gun was better guns
[3:42:57] <ooblag> You could have BIGGER guns though
[3:42:58] <%manwithboxonhead> GUN
[3:42:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @aazv17 For their Minecraft coins and Funko Pops
[3:43:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Buying those guns is stupid.
[3:43:02] <KatabolicRage> the 38 is hands down the worst gun in the game, you should really replace it with a glock that can fire more than once a day
[3:43:02] <Kief_Gringo> Soon there will be no GameStops or goth clerks lol
[3:43:03] <gustavozxd> auspex
[3:43:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Hack low
[3:43:11] <+logoth_> I ended up replacing a dying PS4 for 17 cents through a trade in. It worked JUST WELL ENOUGH to pass their test
[3:43:11] <a1u5> Blood Buff
[3:43:11] <aazv17> @TIME_PUNCHER lmao
[3:43:12] <+ShadowArcangel> auspex
[3:43:16] <LtSergei> i don't think bloodbuff does that
[3:43:16] <KeystoneA1> bloodbuff doesn't help hacking
[3:43:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bloodbuff doesn't raise wits.
[3:43:17] <StromkoPenguin> Typing harder doesn't make you hack better
[3:43:18] <NumberTooBig> gamestops there for when you want a game but the creators are huge dicks
[3:43:20] <NeroInfinite> No goth clerks are eternal gamestops are not
[3:43:21] <ooblag> Nope
[3:43:23] <shlaggori> auspex
[3:43:23] <KatabolicRage> bloodbuff is for physical stuff
[3:43:23] <Erektionsite> auspex
[3:43:24] <+EdenOfLove> asupex
[3:43:24] <%AlastorSlain> auspex

[3:48:29] <ooblag> Are you going to write an article on Kotaku about it?
[3:48:29] <%MagickBurritoh> the game is unfair so Pat had to cheat
[3:48:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[3:48:31] <+Ryallen> It has just as much meaning and it's just as fulfilling and valid as not
[3:48:32] <OwlLightningMage> [Redacted] lives in the vents
[3:48:34] <energywarning> so what pat is saying is that V:tMB needs an easy mode
[3:48:34] <LtSergei> check the car stereo on the counter

[3:49:06] <%SolidusRex> That ain't Vanbdal
[3:49:08] <Tampaoster> Sequence Breakage the Stream
[3:49:12] <OwlLightningMage> It totally sounds like Dan LUL
[3:49:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> In fact, it felt even better than normal because knowing that's unethical turns me on or some shit
[3:49:13] <gustavozxd> you cheated not only on the game, but yourself. you didn't grow. you didn't improve.
[3:49:16] <natebud> locked from the inside LUL

[3:49:32] <%spiritofmojave> 15 sodding years
[3:49:33] <+Goat___Boy> Slapping the bass
[3:49:34] <LtSergei> VTMB should have an easy mode
[3:49:37] <PsychoTheLunatic> Hey wait, if the scummy landlord is taping the apartments, wouldn't entering them as a nosferatu count as a masquerade violation?
[3:49:37] <%ElenaManetta> nYEEH nyehh hheehh
[3:49:40] <aristomuse> stuff on counter
[3:49:42] <Yeajow> Man just like a speedrunner
[3:49:42] <$RubberFistFight> @Tampaoster remember that time he was bragging about sequence breaking when DS:Remastered came out, and he broke the fucking game within 10 minutes and had to start again?
[3:50:00] <Erektionsite> @PsychoTheLunatic Its fine, probably thinks you are some kinky roleplayer
[3:50:02] <%SolidusRex> @Estuko Dude, I unironically steal his guitar every playthrough and move it to my own apartment.
[3:50:02] <ooblag> VTMB is gatekeeping by requiring you to read the dialogue prompts

[3:50:37] <+Estuko> @SolidusRex LUL I'm new to this and that knowledge that you could do that fill me with joy

[4:13:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> kirby is a hero
[4:13:03] <%MonsieurHedge> is kirby just feeding pat more power?
[4:13:12] <PsychoTheLunatic> @MonsieurHedge Parking lot level, I'm dead
[4:13:17] <Run44forrest> @MonsieurHedge lol
[4:13:20] <%vectorless_peon> Kirby whoah
[4:13:27] <VirtuaRailith> The train of thought is more/less coherent when heard all at once.
[4:13:27] <+Estuko> @MonsieurHedge DUO WIELDD
[4:13:30] <majindusto> Much Sense is Appearently Made
[4:13:36] <$RubberFistFight> Kirby keeps trying to trap Pat in pronunciation traps to the point where he was threatened with a ban. Of course Pat is gonna parse the messages before he reads them, jesus.
[4:13:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Promessa_EX) (warning)
[4:13:46] <libraDoom> they sounds dyslexic cause that how people read my writing
[4:13:56] <%spiritofmojave> Red Bull seller, I need only your STRONGEST energy drinks
[4:13:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> If you have to donate to try and justify your ponytail, you should get rid of that ponytail
[4:13:59] <yodajr99> yoo doods
[4:14:02] <%ECRead> fire indeed hot
[4:14:04] <majindusto> FLAME BAD
[4:14:07] <SiegeJay> REMEMBER: Pat does not read donations the moment they go up. So don't expect him to be a Stream Expert like Max
[4:14:08] <%MonsieurHedge> fuckin uhhh i cant remember the dragons dogma quote
[4:14:11] <%manwithboxonhead> FIRE BAD
[4:14:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[4:14:17] <$RubberFistFight> @TIME_PUNCHER remember when he donated to explain how he totally didn't shit in his own pants, shoes AND socks?
[4:14:20] <%JenovasPuppet> What if you only bought one Red Bull at a time? Gotta walk to the store each time for exercise.
[4:14:26] <+Promessa_EX> PAT those redbulls are consumables what if you need them later
[4:14:30] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Oh, is Pat new to WoD lore?
[4:14:31] <%MonsieurHedge> @RubberFistFight what in the goddamn
[4:14:38] <yodajr99> is the stream over?
[4:14:40] <Rhinoprotoss> But that if you NEED it?
[4:14:45] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @RubberFistFight I didn't want to, but here we are
[4:14:49] <%JenovasPuppet> @yodajr99 Yep.
[4:14:49] <lilmac64> Didn't Tremere have to make constant Willpower saves in the tabletop to even use Thaumaturgy?
[4:15:02] <%GarbageNirvana> <3
[4:15:02] <Run44forrest> what
[4:15:06] <%JenovasPuppet> LUL
[4:15:07] <SiegeJay> News Flash: The Red Bulls don't make Pat fast enough to read donations when they go up. CoolStory
[4:15:07] <majindusto> Huh?
[4:15:09] <%spiritofmojave> eh
[4:15:11] <$RubberFistFight> @MonsieurHedge yeah, he then donated like 2 more times after that to try and explain it more. Like, he coulda stopped at any point but he just doubled the fuck down.
[4:15:14] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ????????
[4:15:14] <KangarooCyborg> nice callback
[4:15:20] <emillionghost> ripitty dee my dad...........

[4:15:29] <%MonsieurHedge> @RubberFistFight i can only respect this level of hustle
[4:15:34] <%velemi> Ooff, that really is dark
[4:15:36] <Run44forrest> i dont get it
[4:15:45] <majindusto> Pat wants to get Wings
[4:15:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @RubberFistFight I swear the whole thing is some post-modern art project
[4:16:02] <$RubberFistFight> @MonsieurHedge well it stopped being funny when he tried to trick Pat into saying something that could get him banned from Twitch, so there's that.
[4:16:09] <emillionghost> @RubberFistFight its a lyric in Bikie man (youtube vid)
[4:16:11] <majindusto> BOOOOOOOOOOO

[4:17:27] <+cvp5127> oh no
[4:17:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:17:28] <%JenovasPuppet> LATISHA
[4:17:33] <OwlLightningMage> Latisha LUL
[4:17:35] <%castcode> Latisha is the best
[4:17:36] <majindusto> Laticia
[4:17:36] <%Niney_Who> Latisha obviously
[4:17:37] <%spiritofmojave> Latisha is awful man
[4:17:37] <Gameslayer2> Latisha
[4:17:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Latisha is HILARIOUS
[4:17:38] <%manwithboxonhead> Latisha
[4:17:40] <$RubberFistFight> @emillionghost heh, it's all good. Hopefully your intended recipient saw it regardless LUL
[4:17:40] <OwlLightningMage> I love Latisha LUL
[4:17:40] <%Keyd00d> Larry's cool
[4:17:41] <PsychoTheLunatic> Never expected to cry on Pat's stream
[4:17:41] <%GarbageNirvana> The difference is I've met Fat Larry
[4:17:43] <%ECRead> Latisha is bad
[4:17:43] <%JenovasPuppet> Fat Larry is owning it
[4:17:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fat Larry is fucking cool
[4:17:50] <+Bupkis7> Fat Larry is great you shut up
[4:17:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the PACIFICS!
[4:17:55] <%MonsieurHedge> fat larry could easily be like a fat southerner. latisha CANNOT be anything but an awful racial stereotype
[4:17:55] <KangarooCyborg> eating the infinity hot dog
[4:17:56] <%Niney_Who> Fat Larry sells dinosaur eggs
[4:17:57] <%castcode> Latisha pulls immaculate hotdogs out of the trash
[4:17:58] <damienlunas> Wasn't Latisha's accent the idea of her black voice actress or something?
[4:17:58] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat how dare you say that about paige Kappa
[4:17:58] <%ECRead> Fat Larry's great
[4:17:59] <majindusto> "Latisha"
[4:18:02] <%JenovasPuppet> Fat Larry is a god damn role modal!
[4:18:03] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat i think that'd be unflattering regardless though, so...
[4:18:03] <Neo_Kaiser> Latisha was played by a black person who wanted to play it like that, wasn't she?
[4:18:04] <%ElenaManetta> But people say they've met many Latisha's in Detroit
[4:18:07] <%SolidusRex> Fat Larry is awesome
[4:18:09] <emillionghost> fat larry is at least cool...
[4:18:10] <%ElenaManetta> So Latisha exists more than Fat Larry
[4:18:10] <%spiritofmojave> Fat Larry is the best, he runs a successful business
[4:18:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I met people who are like Fat Larry in my life.
[4:18:16] <%VanaSkiller> well shiiiiiet cap'n
[4:18:25] <%Divryne> LUL
[4:18:26] <%ECRead> that man's got a Galapagos turtle though
[4:18:28] <SparkAfterDark> I live in Detroit
[4:18:28] <OwlLightningMage> Fat larry is totally a guy I have met
[4:18:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thats true
[4:18:35] <SparkAfterDark> It's... real
[4:18:36] <KangarooCyborg> well if it ain't da cap'im his self!
[4:18:36] <Run44forrest> oh... rippidity that is dark
[4:18:39] <%MonsieurHedge> thats ALMOST WORSE
[4:18:41] <KatabolicRage> sure, I'm sure that was it
[4:18:43] <%Kirby_Sauce> Big Bo
[4:18:44] <$RubberFistFight> @ECRead And dinosaur eggs, we don't know what kind!
[4:18:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> We got dinosaur eggs! I don't know what kind, buy 'em and hatch 'em!
[4:18:45] <%SaltyDongs> lies
[4:18:52] <SiegeJay> PAT is showing how sheltered life he has
[4:18:54] <Atheistpreacher> I bought a dwarf saddle from Fat larry and it was of only the highest quality
[4:18:55] <+Dives__> It was the actor's idea to do that accent
[4:19:01] <%Admiralpoosh> Admiralpoosh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[4:19:04] <SiegeJay> There are Latishas out there
[4:19:07] <MSN04_Sazabi> More like paper bag test dialog
[4:19:10] <%Niney_Who> She just tells you to suffocate everyone
[4:19:10] <SparkAfterDark> I live in Detroit and have met Latischas before. It's very sad and uncomfortable
[4:19:16] <%MonsieurHedge> chat convince paige to do the Riker Chair-Hop on stream
[4:19:16] <$RubberFistFight> Captain Picard saving the day with his good ideas once again
[4:19:19] <damienlunas> Still, even if the actress is black, I don't think it can excuse "SHIEEET CAPP'N I DON'T KNOW NUFFIN 'BOUT THE PACIFICS"
[4:19:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:19:29] <%Kirby_Sauce> I said they should apply the rule to melee players
[4:19:32] <%JenovasPuppet> Introducing a laser pointer to pat and paige streams can only lead to abuse...
[4:19:39] <%FrustratedAF> everyone deserves a swivel chair
[4:19:39] <%jiin6> SHOWER OR SHADOW REALM your choice
[4:19:44] <%KasGiD> Yugioh players have to learn how to read. Melee players don't.
[4:19:48] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Gespens) (warning)

[4:19:58] <SiegeJay> @damienlunas The excuse is that there are people who do act like that
