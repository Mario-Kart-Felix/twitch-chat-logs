[0:13:07] <leviathan666303> pat and honor in the same sentence LUL
[0:13:07] <gorillahandz> What about the tonal dissonance of Kiryu being all anti-killing and then slamming several people into the pavement
[0:13:07] <%spiritofmojave> Pat has NO HONOR
[0:13:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like Kiryu is absolutely the man with no name trope from Yojimbo.
[0:13:09] <gigacanuck> shut up pat, you are not honor-bound
[0:13:09] <%ElenaManetta> You HATE raiding him

[0:13:55] <$valriot> Assault is fine
[0:13:55] <gigacanuck> @deadguyisdead pretty sure it's french for some beef-based food product
[0:13:57] <person181> NEAR death
[0:13:58] <+Fynale> destruction of property?
[0:13:59] <%LuckyLagomorph> apatBig assault
[0:13:59] <%joylent_blue> he LOVES self defense murder
[0:13:59] <Ion_Laser> so it's self-defense?
[0:14:00] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Self Defence is fine Kappa
[0:14:01] <Dr_Mooose> self-defense
[0:14:01] <Mr_Strut> Assault is the most honorable of crimes
[0:14:01] <Finaldragoon> Kiryu doesn't kill people Kappa
[0:14:03] <Darren716> Its self defense
[0:14:04] <%shiplord13> And real estate if you consider what he does during that a crime
[0:14:04] <%TheNewJapanGuy> TheNewJapanGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Pat, hope you enjoy Yakuza 6! (Just try to not get burned out) Thanks for the stream!

[0:14:06] <alexandrecau> Agressive self defense
[0:14:07] <%DirtyGaijin> apart from those drunk guys in zero?
[0:14:07] <Lokuul> Kiryu actually self defences people with SWORDS!
[0:14:08] <+dramajoe> honorable death
[0:14:09] <falconx9k> They always deserve it
[0:14:10] <%nitronLVIII> Agrivated self defense
[0:14:13] <切捨御免> don't forget the car chase sequences
[0:14:13] <%dukenux> Kiryu never killed anyone Kappa
[0:14:13] <gorillahandz> Fashion crimes maybe

[0:14:14] <+Mr_Initials> Very strong self defense
[0:14:15] <person181> remember it's a hazing thing pat, THEY STARTED IT
[0:14:15] <vingadivo> assault is not a crime in the yakuza world otherwise every single man wouod be in jail
[0:14:15] <%joylent_blue> oh boy
[0:14:16] <Ion_Laser> HOLD ON
[0:14:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiryu hits people. If they die after he leaves, he didn't kill them.
[0:14:17] <@SSaryn> I JUST TUNED IN AND THATS THE RIGHT PHOTO FOR THIS LAYOUT
[0:14:20] <%Deft_Thought> @AngriestPat Don't be ridiculous. Kiryu's never killed ANYONE ever!

[0:14:28] <Dr_Mooose> it begins
[0:14:28] <$nademonkey1100> the sun is the enemy
[0:14:30] <Ner234> "The Song of Life" does this phrase become relevant later or is this lost in Japanese?
[0:14:31] <artoflec> red sun over paaraadiiiise
[0:14:32] <Finaldragoon> Sundowner, but he's not fucking invincible
[0:14:36] <%spiritofmojave> But it's always night in SPAAACE for Piage
[0:14:36] <%yalreadyknow> jersey miikes is better
[0:14:37] <%dukenux> Kiryu doesn't kill. He just beats up people so hard, they die of injuries.

[0:15:26] <televisedrevolting> yay
[0:15:27] <%kenpachi9211> MOIVE TIME WITH PAT
[0:15:28] <$nademonkey1100> is this a METAL GEAR GAME?!
[0:15:30] <Lamedhos> Someone got the popcorn?
[0:15:31] <Solidus_113> I got popcorn and hot chocolate
[0:15:31] <%RobotPancake> movie night with pat yeyeye
[0:15:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> for now
[0:15:33] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat so it's just like a Kojima game
[0:15:34] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> This is the first game, I think, where the entire game is voiced.
[0:15:34] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Damn Metal Gear Solid 6 sounds promising Kappa
[0:15:37] <%GohanEgret> @HeadsHeldHigh oh god don't remind me
[0:15:39] <%TheNewJapanGuy> "That's Correct"
[0:15:41] <%ElenaManetta> I can literally take a nap come back and you will have just then been starting
[0:15:41] <+valkuma> so basically come back in 2 hours once youre done with donations & the intro movie? Kappa
[0:15:46] <cheezbass> kojima guest director
[0:15:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Who? Kappa
[0:15:47] <tj_timbs> (and the characters that have 2 scenes in the game)
[0:15:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Mystery Science Pat 3000
[0:15:49] <Ner234> Well I guess that's fine
[0:15:50] <Basch71> despite Y6's weakpoints, I still had fun with it
[0:15:50] <+mcjimbo12> Majima basically just some guy blubblubluh to be fair
[0:15:52] <%Laecerelius> Majima, Kiryu's life partner
[0:15:59] <%joylent_blue> are Kiryu and Majima finally married in this game
[0:16:01] <%sshen> Majima (is everywhere)
[0:16:01] <%HiroTSK5> And you don't even meet half the important characters in that early game
[0:16:02] <%nitronLVIII> ...
[0:16:04] <WreckItRaz> finally just picked this up yesterday! glad you're playing it
[0:16:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Majima is Kiryus lover
[0:16:05] <%Solidnick18> majima is the guy who go kiryu chan and people love it
[0:16:06] <%spiritofmojave> Majima, Kiryu's fight boyfriend
[0:16:09] <TalisKanju> Are we going to get to see Pat use Joker in Smash?
[0:16:11] <%these_pockets> aw man that famous guy called you fat I'd be so embarassed
[0:16:12] <$Haughtymoss_> Majima = Vegeta
[0:16:13] <Graywolf_the_45th> I can't wait to see Saejima go to jail again
[0:16:18] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Combat is 6 is alright, Kiwami 2 is better
[0:16:19] <gorillahandz> Majima, AKA Challenger Pack 2
[0:16:23] <alexandrecau> Combat in 6 is great aside a few hiccups
[0:16:23] <+HellCopter> 6 is pretty loose but as long as you don't 100% the game you won't get too sick of it
[0:16:24] <artoflec> I liked instant style switching, the enemy design is annoying
[0:16:29] <%Prevot> yeah but there's like no heat moves
[0:16:30] <Darren716> Are you going to recap 5?
[0:16:32] <roflwaffleauthoritah> Kiryu's usual friends are in this for like 2 minutes total though
[0:16:32] <+OperatorPlease> is this the one with saejima going full "rouge of love"
[0:16:33] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> Yakuza 6 is really comfy and atmospheric imo, I spent a lot of time just taking pictures of places
[0:16:33] <alexandrecau> like you get some mobility
[0:16:37] <+FrostyAri> you picked the right picture of Kiryu, Pat
[0:16:38] <gorillahandz> Man I wish 0 was just every Yakuza now
[0:16:39] <+Story_Ark> Footnote: "Majima: dont worry about it"
[0:16:41] <%joylent_blue> Darren716 the game itself does that apparently
[0:16:43] <eyezehuhh> I honestly liked 0's combat over 6

[0:16:58] <%MagickBurritoh> Superhot and Hotline Miami in one
[0:17:01] <%Solidnick18> Once you get in the game it's like wow japan seems big
[0:17:02] <gorillahandz> Didn’t that just launch?
[0:17:07] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[0:17:09] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Yakuza 6 has the Microwave Heat move, which is great

[0:22:53] <%HiroTSK5> Luancher

[0:24:55] <gorillahandz> Is Kiryu still a virgin at this point? canonically i mean
[0:24:57] <%topendbuzz> just might be the menu
[0:24:59] <%manwithboxonhead> I have no idea about anything about Yakuza other than catching a few minutes every now and then.

[0:35:23] <+ahegotrigger> how did you swing him
[0:35:25] <+theAncopro> and the ragdoll throw will knock down other people too
[0:35:26] <rubbishbinge> t h e p h y s I c s
[0:35:26] <%Prevot> throwing is VERY useful in this game
[0:35:26] <Dante_the_spooks_man> @angriestpat kick the bicycle physics in this engine are great
[0:35:27] <%spiritofmojave> Those rag-doll physics are so silly and good
[0:35:27] <alexandrecau> oh yes get used to the hammer throw best move
[0:35:27] <gorillahandz> 6 after 0
[0:35:30] <T_Sasquatch> you'll love yakuza Kiwami 2
[0:35:34] <majima666> yakuzas combat has always been over the top so i think it suits perfectly

[0:41:00] <+mcjimbo12> Worth remember that he spent a BIG LONG time in prison by the time of yakuza 1
[0:41:01] <%GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Aren't most of the bad Yakuza dudes old as hell tho?

[0:47:24] <$cureneckbeard> pretty sure that idol outfit belongs to her agency. she stole that outfit
[0:47:25] <%DirtyGaijin> majima not committing crime? absurd
[0:47:26] <%dukenux> Just like Kiryu never kills
[0:47:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Majima is a good man
[0:47:29] <Fien111> Kiryu never killed anyone, he only beating thousands to implied crippling with bicycles over the course of like 30 years
[0:47:29] <FriendlyPatches> Assalting Kyriu is not a crime
[0:47:31] <%Jetsfantasy> Being murdered is the opposite of crime
[0:47:32] <Run44forrest> majima never crimed somebody
[0:47:32] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @thatguyfrommars Good point LUL
[0:47:34] <gorillahandz> name one thing The Mad Dog of Shimano has done wrong
[0:47:34] <%starkandstag> he’s an honest construction foreman
[0:47:35] <MayShip> Date is the coolest cause he's a real bro
[0:47:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> I guess what i was gonna say is a spoiler
[0:47:39] <FatherGreyBeard> Can't have them do whatever they want
[0:47:40] <rosencruez> politics
[0:47:45] <gorillahandz> fuck the police and fuck the politicians
[0:47:46] <xeros720> tv crimes are the only crimes that matter
[0:47:47] <+Spec7re> Kiryu literally keeps everyone else in japan in check though
[0:47:49] <worldbrand> there's only one person who ends up keeping the tojo clan in check and he's arrested again
[0:47:49] <%dukenux> Of course the heads will get away clean
[0:47:52] <+jorgamund> also would somebody PLEASE get that girl a pair of jeans already!
[0:47:52] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Wasn't Kiryu only chairman for like five minutes
[0:47:52] <falconx9k> System's fucked
[0:47:53] <alexandrecau> Oh yes because Daigo is gonna keep in check
[0:48:01] <Dante_the_spooks_man> Preforming heat actions on live TV is a huge crime
[0:48:02] <%lewdskeletor13> They need Kiryu to beat up the bad guys tho
[0:48:03] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Fuck The Bosses
[0:48:04] <%Solidnick18> yeah he was in a coma
[0:48:04] <Ner234> A living legend
[0:48:04] <stuffstuffwhatever> I mean, Kiryu fights for the tojo clan like every game Jebaited
[0:48:04] <+Toppunchpoopbob> 10 years in this game
[0:48:04] <Halospaz117> DOJIMA NO RYU
[0:48:08] <%zanzibar_junker> gotta save face
[0:48:09] <+theAncopro> Mad Dog of Shim-WHO
[0:48:11] <%shiplord13> Wow
[0:48:11] <%Gatzarlok> The bestworst yakuza
[0:48:12] <person181> remember, he WAS a chairmen
[0:48:13] <alexandrecau> like Kiryu is gone Tojo burns
[0:48:13] <SomersaultJustice> do you play as only kiryu in this game?
[0:48:14] <%zanzibar_junker> at all costs
[0:48:14] <+Deano8817> he's legendary BECAUSE of that
[0:48:14] <count_bob> Again.
[0:48:16] <+Flambage> Kiryu was chairman for 10 minutes
[0:48:19] <rosencruez> legends never die, they just get arrested
[0:48:19] <gorillahandz> and it was the best 12 hours of the Tojo clan
[0:48:20] <theangryguyofde> @cureneckbeard what, you think her Manager is gonna get it back LUL
[0:48:20] <%shiplord13> Most successful chairman
[0:48:21] <$NocturneNovember> Kiryu was chairman for like fiv minutes, let's be real
[0:48:24] <%AncelDeLambert> he was literally only Chairman long enough to fuck up a corrupt politician
[0:48:25] <%dukenux> Kiryu is the Jesus of Yakuzies. he takes all the punishemnt on himself
[0:48:25] <%Niney_Who> Not getting arrested in Japan LUL
[0:48:25] <%TheNewJapanGuy> No.
[0:48:26] <%spiritofmojave> What to do you think Haruka's thinking through this, CAN I SEE MY DAD FOR MORE THAN TEN MINUTES?
[0:48:27] <reonome> LUL
[0:48:27] <%shiplord13> Nah
[0:48:27] <+misterfistor> fun fact: Makoto Date also does the voice for Geralt in The Witcher @AngriestPat
[0:48:30] <+daisyyyy> Everyone still talks about it tho
[0:48:30] <VRNK> kiryu doesnt know what crime is
[0:48:32] <Dehlome> hell fight the judge
[0:48:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Kiryu would punch a lawyer
[0:48:32] <TheGershon> Kiryu doesn't even know what LAW is
[0:48:32] <%GohanEgret> his FISTS are his lawyer
[0:48:33] <gorillahandz> GET PHOENIX
[0:48:34] <falconx9k> He met Phoenix Wright
[0:48:34] <+Spec7re> A lawyer? What is that some kind of mini game?!
[0:48:34] <Fien111> Lawyer is an especially weak enemy type
[0:48:34] <BunnyEmperor> how do I law
[0:48:34] <starotter70> Probably not
[0:48:35] <%SaltyDongs> Lawyer?
[0:48:36] <reonome> 99% CONVICTION RATE
[0:48:36] <arcaderabbit48> Kiryu will punch the law and go free
[0:48:38] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat A lawyer you mean my fists
[0:48:39] <%ElenaManetta> why is that making me laugh
[0:48:39] <%Ilpala271> It's been six games. He has to have done a sidequest for at least one lawyer by now
[0:48:40] <%Rngiddion> neither does japan so dont worry
[0:48:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Kiryu is probably wondering if he can fight the judge for no time.
[0:48:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Kiryu does not seem to be a smart man
[0:48:42] <%lewdskeletor13> JUSGE EYES
[0:48:43] <majima666> "do lawyers beat up people?"
[0:48:43] <soraabora> what is the law you speak of
[0:48:44] <frogurtz> plz. the Japanese court system is fucked.
[0:48:44] <%ElenaManetta> it's the dumbest inoffensive thing to not know
[0:48:46] <%Solidnick18> Kiryu doesn't know alot
[0:48:46] <%Laecerelius> Only thing Kiryu knows about the law is that you should break it!
[0:48:46] <Run44forrest> ace attorney cross over PogChamp
[0:48:47] <roflwaffleauthoritah> there's no law only HONOUR
[0:48:48] <VanLynx> Kiryu's fists are his lawyers
[0:48:50] <%Jetsfantasy> A lawyer is a street fight with a police officer for freedom
[0:48:50] <gorillahandz> Majima knows Phoenix, he can introduce him to Kiryu!
[0:48:52] <$Brother_Coduss> "lawyer? is that some kind of fighting style?
[0:48:53] <LozsCat> 99% Conviction
[0:48:54] <pipboy344> How long has Pat been streaming?
[0:48:55] <+DeaconBluesClues> @AngriestPat is kiryu just ryu in a suit

[0:48:56] <JrSpore> like ryu?
[0:48:56] <%dukenux> "Is it the thing you use to mow grass"
[0:48:56] <%spiritofmojave> Lawyers hit people with bibles, right?
[0:48:58] <mandalor89> Didnt kiryu beat up a lawyer at the beginning of zero
[0:48:58] <%ElenaManetta> lawyers are like part of the BC era
[0:48:58] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:48:59] <tj_timbs> THIS PART
[0:48:59] <VRNK> kiryu is well known for being a bad criminal
[0:48:59] <Fien111> He's basically Yakuza Guts

[0:49:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> A lawyer walks up to kiryu, rips off his shirt and there's a tattoo of the scales of justice on his back
[0:49:04] <%dukenux> Feudal error
[0:49:04] <%Verd_254> I don't think the Japanese justice system cares what a lawyer is

[0:53:30] <leviathan666303> cocaine hell zone sounds like a bad sonic level
[0:53:30] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> BTW, apparantely Tanimura's actor didn't even do coke, it was supposedly just powered candy people thought was coke.
[0:53:30] <%shiplord13> He is going to fast foward through Diago
[0:53:31] <@SSaryn> Still like Akiyama more than Saejima honestly, but they're both high up there.
[0:53:32] <+DeaconBluesClues> note: the cocaine dimension is less fun than it initially sounds

[0:57:49] <+Irridium> because Japan
[0:57:50] <+ahegotrigger> it is stupid
[0:57:50] <%spiritofmojave> Just leave those orphans to their own devices, it's FINEEE
[0:57:51] <+Toblo1> Because Japanese Society is borked
[0:57:52] <$nademonkey1100> isnt that what he said last time too?
[0:57:52] <%dukenux> Because Kiryu is a Hool magnet
[0:57:52] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> That's fine

[0:57:57] <%Dead_Pal_VeeGeeZee> if it makes others do less evil
[0:57:57] <falconx9k> BUT HONOR
[0:57:58] <mastermidget23> He's the Hank Hill of Yakuza
[0:58:00] <roflwaffleauthoritah> why would a convicted criminal even be allowed an orphanage?
[0:58:01] <%Jetsfantasy> Opposite of Goku
[0:58:02] <+Spec7re> Yakuza is the story of a guy who should NOT be in the yakuza
[0:58:03] <Dante_the_spooks_man> Japan is stupid
[0:58:04] <gorillahandz> majima can take care of th orphans what could go wrong?
[0:58:07] <rosencruez> because the smear papers
[0:58:08] <thegreenbenis> MUH HONOR
[0:58:08] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat that seems to be typical of moral paragons
[0:58:09] <theangryguyofde> we literally don't lose 1000 clansmen when you aren't here Kiryu
[0:58:11] <Bouldus> wait its called morning glory? ahahah
[0:58:12] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat Isn't that what got him in hot water to begin with in Zero?
[0:58:12] <starotter70> Because Media bs I think
[0:58:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's because Yakuza is a SAMURAI game.
[0:58:15] <%Sycada> that god damn mainstream media! fake news!
[0:58:15] <+Deadbulky> Why is the ophanage called MORNING GLORY? like common man really
[0:58:17] <%El_Desperad0> Kiryu has the body of a Man, but the mentality of a child who watches too much Sentai
[0:58:18] <+theAncopro> he's so lawful it's actually choatic
[0:58:19] <%DirtyGaijin> Isn't Morning Glory another word for Morning Wood
[0:58:19] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Does Kiryu just think it is best for him to suffer for everyone like Jesus?
[0:58:20] <rosencruez> it IS media BS
[0:58:20] <%snow_bush> How does Kiryu make money?
[0:58:20] <Run44forrest> heaven is just pocket racing 24/7
[0:58:21] <+OperatorPlease> "i have to go to jail because I GOTTA GET CLEAN"
[0:58:22] <majima666> he's like hulk hogan without the cuntisness
[0:58:23] <%Gatzarlok> Kiryu has his honor stat cranked up to 99
[0:58:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiryu is a wandering hero.
[0:58:23] <$cureneckbeard> it's a type of flower
[0:58:23] <Bouldus> is that the orphanages name?
[0:58:24] <%Ahack13> It makes like no sense that he became a Yakuza member.
[0:58:24] <gorillahandz> Kiryu's a big fan of Oasis, okay?
[0:58:25] <@SSaryn> And he says the media will be on them 24/7 if hes there but Haruka was AN IDOL
[0:58:26] <SirDogBear> Kiryu should have stayed with real estate BibleThump
[0:58:26] <%ElenaManetta> You weren't kidding about this being a long intro
[0:58:28] <%spiritofmojave> @gorillahandz Majima watching the orphanage would be a great fucking sitcom LUL
[0:58:29] <+ahegotrigger> I mean I appreciate Kiryus sense of honor and duty but he also a gangster so its weird

[1:02:33] <worldbrand> there would also be a power vacuum

[1:02:38] <DefaultSettiings> this wholesome prison moment
[1:02:38] <+OperatorPlease> what happened in 2? nukes?
[1:02:39] <%stabbityrabbit> But how can they be FAMBLY if Kiryu doesn't know a sex?

[1:02:42] <President_valentine> a ton of people did die in 2
[1:02:42] <Nekros4442> @SirDogBear they point is that Kiryu "wants" to finish his time in jail so that he doesnt have that shit hounding him in the feuture

[1:04:07] <%Mekhet09> He's Anzu.

[1:04:09] <%Kilagn> just seems like a whole lotta talking
[1:04:10] <VritraReiRei> I'm REALLY surprised NONE of these kids got picked up by an ACTUAL Family
[1:04:10] <count_bob> Yup.

[1:04:12] <President_valentine> Shinada is gone like Tanimura
[1:04:12] <+Toppunchpoopbob> not yet
[1:04:12] <+spikebomb5> no hes okinawan
[1:04:13] <%spiritofmojave> Yes
[1:04:13] <starotter70> Basically
[1:04:14] <$SGrim> Haruka's legal? rooH
[1:04:14] <Fien111> That's how that works, sure
[1:04:15] <+ahegotrigger> yep

[1:04:17] <CSeriesJTYPE> SHE LOOKS LIKE SHES 9
[1:04:17] <%AbnormalVoid> man, she does NOT look 18
[1:04:18] <+Deano8817> @Shadowthedigger like 11 years i think?
[1:04:18] <%ElenaManetta> I don't think that's how foster care works but that's never how it works in fiction so whatever
[1:04:18] <Mnightshyamallama> yeah, she pretty much takes care of all the other kids by herself now
[1:04:18] <%El_Desperad0> 19?
[1:04:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sure. Japan is the wild west. Just do what you want.
[1:04:20] <%Solidnick18> Kiryu trusts her
[1:04:20] <%Mekhet09> Or okinawen.
[1:04:21] <%Shadowthedigger> Haruka runs it. Passed down through the family like Kazama would have wanted.
[1:04:21] <%stabbityrabbit> SHE'S 18! Bullshit.
[1:04:21] <gorillahandz> oh fuck thats an orphan? he looks 30
[1:04:21] <prime_name> She even has Kaz's colors.
[1:04:21] <Dehlome> that seems irresponsible
[1:04:22] <%shiplord13> Japan is weird with orphans
[1:04:25] <reonome> uh oh she's legal
[1:04:25] <AmericanaRed> 18 PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

[1:04:33] <@Squishy3> It's really not even an orphanage since they don't get new kids
[1:04:33] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat you legally become an adult at like 16 in japan you don't get forced to finish school in japan
[1:04:33] <mastermidget23> Does Kiryu know a SINGLE responsible adult?
[1:04:34] <Mnightshyamallama> cause it was so much better if Kiryu went to jail apparently
[1:04:35] <+Spec7re> People like orphans though

[1:06:46] <%skizzuto> didn't your mom say not to run away at the end of the first game?
[1:06:48] <VritraReiRei> I'm REALLY surprised no one that Kiryu helped in the past is helping DEFEND these two

[1:07:00] <VRNK> YEAH TABLOIDS
[1:07:00] <tank7013> Haruka inherited Kiryu's ability to make really poorly thought out decisions
[1:07:01] <%Solidnick18> BUSTED
[1:07:03] <%stabbityrabbit> All these people talking about Haruka learning dragon style. She should be learning from Majima instead.
[1:07:04] <VRNK> THEY'RE RELIABLE
[1:07:04] <gorillahandz> oof
[1:07:04] <%dukenux> Oh.
[1:07:05] <+OperatorPlease> TECHNICALLY TRUE
[1:07:07] <InvaderKAZ> Is Haruka playable
[1:07:07] <takiyami> Running away from her problems, just like Kiryu taught her.
[1:07:08] <%WackyXmand> Who takes over?
[1:07:08] <+cvp5127> who reads anyway
[1:07:11] <Fien111> She's 18, that's not an adult. You don't become an adult until you start ACTUALLY worrying about taxes ruining your life
[1:07:11] <BunnyEmperor> That wouldn't make it better though lol
[1:07:12] <%captain_history> TABLOIDS
[1:07:14] <%shiplord13> Someone call Mijima to raise these kids
[1:07:14] <stuffstuffwhatever> She's the oldest excluding haruka, FYI
[1:07:16] <@commanderclaw> Paparazzi are evil
[1:07:16] <%ElenaManetta> She just needs to lay low for a week and let the next big Twitter scandal unravel itself

[1:07:22] <BourneWarrior> NOBODY READS ANYMORE
[1:07:22] <StromkoPenguin> Leaving now won't solve anything, they'd just have less support and a terrible reputation
[1:07:25] <%manwithboxonhead> apatBig Yakuza Ties

[1:07:40] <alexandrecau> majima is in jail
[1:07:40] <%dukenux> Damn... Kiryu should've never taught these kids to read.
[1:07:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> YOU never realized how harsh life would be?
[1:07:42] <Nekros4442> Haruka...you saw ur mom get shot in front of you...and ur Dad tried to shoot you multiple times
[1:07:42] <%ElenaManetta> But fuck dead moms in stories

[1:07:55] <%AbnormalVoid> who doesn't do that by that age?
[1:07:56] <leole11> she didn't forget, the writers did
[1:07:56] <%Laecerelius> Look she's got a LOT of repressed memories
[1:07:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Just go get another idol pregnant, then nobody will care about you anymore.
[1:07:57] <%MakotoPB> Japan culturally not an adult until 20 (hatachi)
[1:07:58] <Run44forrest> no that was when she got slapped
[1:07:58] <%Tucker0603> WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB?!

[1:08:02] <alexandrecau> Haruka repressed a lot of her childhood

[1:08:04] <TheGershon> She should just get into jail herself
[1:08:04] <Run44forrest> SICK
[1:08:06] <person181> that tiger fight was super cool
[1:08:06] <%manwithboxonhead> PTSD does funny things with your mind.
[1:08:06] <DefaultSettiings> this could all be resolved if these lazy fucks just used demon magic
[1:08:07] <%shiplord13> There is a lot of trauma
[1:08:08] <AmericanaRed> JOJO6?
[1:08:09] <+ahegotrigger> Leaving only makes the Orphanage worse off
[1:08:10] <+Deadbulky> Protec her
[1:08:10] <+Rachet20> How are you gonna shame children because their parents were Yakuza??
[1:08:10] <Angry_Ev1L> that's a shitty decision
[1:08:10] <%GoldeNOVA> Harka just join the Yakuza
[1:08:11] <%Razputin217> CRYME TYME

[1:25:58] <%HiroTSK5> Haruka was taking care of these kids when she was 16

[1:27:30] <%Solidnick18> 3 years goddamn
[1:27:31] <%DirtyGaijin> the idea of kiryu outside of fights being this bumbling klutz walking into walks
[1:27:33] <%ElenaManetta> Why the hell didn't he phone them once
[1:27:35] <%dukenux> Is this the Dork chambers

[1:28:10] <+Rachet20> @ranger747 It’s wild especially since his groups puts so much effort into their streams
[1:28:13] <%Jetsfantasy> Haruka during her speech: "I wish I spent more time with him."Haruka afterwards: "Later bitches!"
[1:28:13] <alexandrecau> haruka can't get in something shady, just pregnant

[1:28:17] <CyricZ42> Brokiyama

[1:47:47] <The_Murray_Carp> You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.

[2:02:49] <%spiritofmojave> Yes
[2:02:50] <razorgem> sshhhh
[2:02:52] <majindusto> Yes
[2:02:54] <tj_timbs> It is
[2:02:54] <%Sulliman34> this is the best seizing firearm ever cause kiryu just UNLOADS in the dude
[2:02:55] <%psychocalibur> nice
[2:02:58] <Bailey__gaming> if only it was that easy
[2:03:04] <%Mekhet09> More stats.
[2:03:07] <%Solidnick18> all these spoilers
[2:03:09] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Don't neglect your base stats
[2:03:09] <ShichiNoBushi> Essence of Seizures
[2:03:15] <@SSaryn> @angriestpat Just to let you know, theres actually some good shit when it comes to the Clan Creator stuff, not counting NJPW being in it. You'll need the growth when you're doing it.
[2:03:16] <InugamiTheHound> No you don't! You're just saying that and 5 seconds you're gonna be confused!
[2:03:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Essence of repeating knee must be bought
[2:03:21] <majindusto> Kiwami 2 also has NJPW in it
[2:03:21] <+SaltySombrero> @Flambage it's too late
[2:03:28] <%Kduff89> goddamn he can do so much after that bun
[2:03:30] <zepelinnn> pat you OCD fuck
[2:03:31] <+Vikingdeath1> @AngriestPat Purple XP is the hardest to get, followed by Green.
[2:03:33] <%Kduff89> big cheater bun
[2:03:39] <%deviljhojho94> YE
[2:03:42] <President_valentine> it kind of is
[2:03:42] <+Shindeil> @angriestpat It is.
[2:03:43] <%deviljhojho94> i mean ye
[2:03:43] <%Rngiddion> normally you have a better xp curve
[2:03:45] <zepelinnn> just do one a lot then the rest
[2:03:47] <%spiritofmojave> it sorta can be, but still better than Kiwami
[2:03:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> yeah but number go up
[2:03:49] <+HellCopter> If you wanna max it out you'll go insane
[2:03:52] <tank7013> To be fair you wouldn't be doing so much at once without those rainbow buns
[2:03:52] <+ahegotrigger> yeah this looks annoying
[2:03:54] <person181> it become more of a check list later on
[2:03:54] <+ThatHomestar> nah, green is hardest to get by far
[2:03:55] <%nitronLVIII> next stream "So I did some griding of stream"
[2:03:55] <%Menitta> It is yeah. Unfortunately its harder in K2
[2:03:56] <%Valison> its less annoying if you mash out one stat at a time tbh
[2:04:00] <%dukenux> Five kinds of xp
[2:04:00] <%Sulliman34> you should grab the clan growth
[2:04:01] <ClutchPython> You can burst through everything if you upgrade attack
[2:04:01] <maverickdrifter> Hoping that PCO eventually becomes part of the yakuza series
[2:04:07] <%dukenux> that's already much
[2:04:08] <Boomcannon> green is the hardest to gain
[2:04:10] <+Toppunchpoopbob> But xp is consumable D:
[2:04:10] <NeroInfinite> Yeah green and puprle kept knee capping me later on.
[2:04:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> essence of repeating knee, the move where you hold somebodies head down and knee them in the face for 30 seconds
[2:04:16] <stuffstuffwhatever> You can farm purple xp at cafe alps with the blue mountain drink, but it's fairly costly and takes a lot of time
[2:04:20] <Capn_Bilge> electromagnetic TORTURE
[2:04:20] <%Das_Bass> you should Karaoke when you're done apatGib
[2:04:23] <+mecharocky> It's fairly easy to raise your base stats right until about the 150 mark and then its a pain
[2:04:24] <%Niney_Who> Those are sick
[2:04:24] <WHMBoar> spend all your EXP on gaining more EXP
[2:04:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> Be sure to grab Essence of Murder
[2:04:27] <%Solidnick18> chop sticks is sick
[2:04:27] <count_bob> Electromagnetic Torture.
[2:04:28] <%Menitta> Dash attack is good
[2:04:29] <count_bob> Please.
[2:04:30] <danpc5> you can get a an item that gives lots of EXP at the GYM
[2:04:32] <%Solidnick18> i like that
[2:04:32] <%Niney_Who> I hope Kiryu still does his backflip divekick
[2:04:32] <%Rngiddion> your gonna scroll past Essense of Electromagnectic Torture?
[2:04:35] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Check all the heat moves
[2:04:38] <Chester_goes_Berserk> You can break it in kiwami 2 off the bat with gambling cheat items and restaurants
[2:04:48] <dheng1> That dash drop kick is so good
[2:04:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what if you need your AP later? You can't just SPEND it! Kappa
[2:04:51] <+Vikingdeath1> now you got tonsa stuff. KARAOKE TIME!
[2:04:52] <stuffstuffwhatever> Evasion strike is really important in my opinion
[2:04:53] <MayShip> charging attacks are so much better in K2
[2:04:53] <%Solidnick18> yeah dash attack
[2:05:01] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yep
[2:05:01] <zepelinnn> CHECK THEM
[2:05:02] <%Kduff89> wait we can fight in the stores?

[2:16:53] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Digestion and stomach gauge are really good
[2:16:54] <$Brother_Coduss> KANPAI
[2:16:55] <kindashagg> man this game looks crisp
[2:16:58] <tank7013> Digestion just lets you farm exp more quickly
[2:17:00] <person181> that's the smart thing
[2:17:00] <stuffstuffwhatever> Digestion is good, but later, you get xp upgrades for each colour stat
[2:17:03] <+Tokanova> kanbai
[2:17:03] <$Valdorick> You gotta beat up people to learn how to digest your food.
[2:17:05] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Yeah that works well
[2:17:06] <tj_timbs> good plan
[2:17:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kanbai

[2:17:16] <majindusto> KANBAI!!!!
[2:17:18] <majima666> kanbai at kanrai
[2:17:19] <tj_timbs> it means it's unlocked but you don't have the EXP
[2:17:19] <%nmaten> its not locked
[2:17:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Can't buy any of that shit yet
[2:17:20] <%spiritofmojave> cannot bai
[2:17:21] <FatherGreyBeard> I think it means that it's available
[2:17:23] <Jflaskd13> just means they're unlocked
[2:17:23] <+Press_X_ToJASON> available, poor
[2:17:24] <%Mekhet09> It means it's not locked.
[2:17:25] <%thewinged7> it means that its not locked, not that you have enough to buy t
[2:17:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Can buy as in they are available rather than locked.
[2:17:26] <%Rngiddion> it means it can be bought if you had enough xp
[2:17:27] <+DesertOfSand> It's not ?????
[2:17:27] <$Brother_Coduss> KANBAI! *takes shot*
[2:17:28] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat "can buy" means it'
[2:17:29] <Graywolf_the_45th> You can't buy anything
[2:17:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> It means unlocked abilities @AngriestPat
[2:17:30] <fIashman92> Can buy probably means not bought
[2:17:31] <+Toppunchpoopbob> it means its purchasable and not locked
[2:17:32] <Jokobeast> I think it's Allowed to Buy, not Can Afford
[2:17:32] <roflwaffleauthoritah> can buy means not locked
[2:17:33] <+tymetak> NOKANBAI
[2:17:34] <takiyami> It means you meet the conditions to buy, not that you have the exp
[2:17:37] <+Caped_Eggy> KANPAI
[2:17:39] <%TheNewJapanGuy> You bought alot already
[2:17:46] <%thewinged7> kanbai means extreme
[2:17:47] <MayShip> the number does not equal the same number
[2:17:48] <%Laecerelius> Gotta unlock moves by upgrading your stats it seems

[2:39:41] <$Valdorick> @BeardedLuchador - every game would be better with a Style Meter
[2:39:52] <%iwishthiswasicq> @CappuccinoGuil Every game has a menu where you can watch all cutscenes from other games, so really you're losing whatever you feel like losing.
[2:40:00] <AzureDragoonGX1> This is definitely one of the most brutal Kiryus Yakuza has developed
[2:40:01] <%BeardedLuchador> @Valdorick apatDab that's the answer I was looking for

[2:40:37] <%shiplord13> Kiryu: So it begins again... Why can't I come to this city and not get involved in Yakzua wars
[2:40:38] <%Big_Dream> stats go to S rank
[2:40:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> @iwishthiswasicq oh okay, so I could just play 5 or 6, watch the cutscenes and be all caught up?
[2:40:44] <%Rngiddion> Kiryu cant even spend a week out of prison without being in some nefarious shit
[2:40:48] <AzureDragoonGX1> @McSnazzyPants Can't afford Aya Hirano's voice, even for one line. Kappa

[2:41:36] <tj_timbs> @AngriestPat run away like a big coward, you can do that now
[2:41:37] <tank7013> The one downside to instant fights
[2:41:39] <+Tokanova> no transitions!

[2:41:41] <SilverFaustX> u can run away, and the whole streat screams

[2:41:58] <%starkandstag> omae wa mou shinderu
[2:41:58] <SixthSun2> Remember during all of this, Kiryu never kills ANYONE
[2:41:59] <hoopray> a little excessive there Kiryu
[2:42:00] <+MrRabbles> this does not look very smooth to me in terms of gameplay
[2:42:00] <AzureDragoonGX1> You do get one during certain segments and bosses though
[2:42:01] <%iwishthiswasicq> @CappuccinoGuil Oh, I guess you said it was yours too. Basically you're not missing much other than gameplay and side stuff.
[2:42:02] <Dr_Mooose> I feel so bad for his face
[2:42:04] <dero45> Brain damage for life
[2:42:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @iwishthiswasicq same. There's something about these games, though, I love watching others playing them rather than play it myself. But for plot, I'll do it
[2:42:05] <AzureDragoonGX1> And you'll see what I mean soon
[2:42:08] <HeadsHeldHigh> SWEEP THE LEG
[2:42:09] <@SSaryn> @angriestpat Do you plan on going for Amon?

[2:42:16] <alexandrecau> that sweep is so good
[2:42:16] <%Das_Bass> the run kick is so good
[2:42:17] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Goons?
[2:42:25] <Capn_Bilge> you can also run alllll over town in fights now
[2:42:27] <stuffstuffwhatever> @AngriestPat You have backturn finishing blows if you do a finishing blow while having analog stick towards the backside of kiryu
[2:42:27] <AzureDragoonGX1> Whoa Amon?
[2:42:27] <%BeardedLuchador> I can't wait until he throws a guy through a window
[2:42:29] <@SSaryn> YEEEEEAH
[2:42:30] <Desertfishing> smooth gameplay
[2:42:30] <%spiritofmojave> Amon in this game is pretty rough
[2:42:31] <zepelinnn> YEYEYEYE
[2:42:33] <%BeardedLuchador> and the shop refuses to sell to him
[2:42:34] <Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:42:34] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat How'd you fair against Yakuza 5 Amon?
[2:42:35] <mr_slaide> I can fap to this.
[2:42:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> Is this the 1st Yakuza 6 stream?
[2:42:36] <FatherGreyBeard> Pizza
[2:42:39] <physicaldepression> amon is fucking dumb in this game
[2:42:39] <%Prevot> PIZZA-LA
[2:42:41] <dheng1> Drop kick is great for crowd control
[2:42:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> KITTY CAFE
[2:42:41] <+Deano8817> amon's a prick in this game
[2:42:42] <+Toppunchpoopbob> But you have like 1 million yen...
[2:42:42] <AzureDragoonGX1> Yeah this is probably the 2nd hardest Amon
[2:42:42] <Dementedpenguin> pizza-la/ jesus I haven't seen that in a good minute
[2:42:43] <%dukenux> Pizza-la
[2:42:44] <DagetStreams> Hired goons...?
[2:42:46] <PortableBoredom> So do you think Kiryu dyes his hair? Isn't he like... pushing 50 now?
[2:42:47] <tj_timbs> I think it's in one of the buildings right next to you
[2:42:48] <%PaladinDupre> first person?

[2:43:00] <%Laecerelius> @AngriestPat Use your SPECIAL EYES
[2:43:03] <physicaldepression> Plus I dont think you even need to do all the substories to get to amon
[2:43:11] <stuffstuffwhatever> And he's not noticed a cool part of the combat and now I'm gonna feel bad for pinging him again to say the same thing that he missed me saying
[2:43:11] <%Kduff89> I know i am going to miss many streams of this but you are fucking kidding yourself if I am not going to watch every goddamn vod for the next few months
[2:43:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> Woah

[2:43:17] <red_blaster> The locker keys are usually inside buildings or in rooftops on that area.
[2:43:19] <+DesertOfSand> He wasn't even using the cone. He just punched them with the cone in his hand
[2:43:20] <切捨御免> oh my god

[2:43:23] <AzureDragoonGX1> @PortableBoredom He's 48 in this If I recall. So yeah, pushing his 50s real soon

[2:44:02] <stuffstuffwhatever> Looking at the restaurant stuff in yakuza always makes me hungry
[2:44:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> holy fuck, how does he have 1 MIL?!
[2:44:04] <%MisterTylerrr> Tonkatsu is good, but Gyoza and Yakisoba are far superior

[3:42:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Whos Haruka again?
[3:42:46] <%Kataguro> Pat, you did all of these things. This is like hearing about helping Chie find her path to being a cop in P5. It's exactly equivalent

[3:42:49] <zepelinnn> finding BORT

[3:51:29] <goddamndavid> how old is Kiryu in 6? late 40s?
[3:51:29] <dheng1> It’s only really bad on base ps4
[3:51:30] <majindusto> Framerate is perfectly fine...SHUT UP
[3:51:35] <Commander_Spyke> Tons of people are really sensitive to frame rate
[3:51:36] <FatherGreyBeard> That guy isn't moving he's fucking dead LUL
[3:51:36] <%deviljhojho94> he is 48
[3:51:37] <+LeroyOctopus> framerate probably seems much worse for people who are used to zero and kawami at 60fps
[3:51:38] <%deviljhojho94> fucking boomer
[3:51:39] <SilverFaustX> it played fine on base ps4
[3:51:40] <Run44forrest> 50s
[3:51:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 But Kiryu, Hiji's advanced learning ai has allowed it to learn over 21 techniques of blowjob! But really though, this makes you like the badguys from ghost in the shell.
[3:51:42] <Saiyza> I'm guessing PS4 Pro, 'cause there's no way Pat would stand MHW on sub-optimal hardware.
[3:51:49] <mayorrev> It drops when there's dummy thicc asscheeks

[4:07:02] <Animorphimagi> xbox, sega genesis whatever...
[4:07:05] <%ssjklyco> no it's not. I see 2 analogs on the bottom
[4:07:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is that why the xbox got the good bayo port

[4:07:18] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it should just be a wiimote to fuck it all off

The use of the term "bromide" or "promide" occurs regardless of whether bromide paper was actually used for the photograph.

[4:09:07] <+C24U> Couldnt you just ASK Haruka for a signed photo?
[4:09:07] <Graywolf_the_45th> A bromide is a chemical compound containing a bromide ion or ligand. This is a bromine atom with an ionic charge of −1; for example, in caesium bromide, caesium cations are electrically attracted to bromide anions to form the electrically neutral ionic compound CsBr.

[4:29:11] <majindusto> COWARD
[4:29:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat you probably want to go to the cat cafe early, so you can start feeding random kitties
[4:29:18] <ミュウレ4242> level 9 wasted takes a bit of work.
[4:29:20] <broth_elemental> WE ARE EXCITED
[4:29:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You don't need to carrot us, we came for ELMO
[4:29:21] <%ssjklyco> show up to your daughter drunk
[4:29:25] <Habblewater> god the ragdoll is the best addition to this game
[4:29:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its the best move in the game
[4:29:26] <+harpsichord_uiy> i wish I had a group of 4-6 friends to be menacing with.. BibleThump
[4:29:29] <falconx9k> YEYEYE
[4:29:29] <$Valdorick> But will we ever see the return of the greatest hero of the entire serious? WALKING ERECTION!?
[4:29:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEEEEP

[4:29:32] <rubbishbinge> hwat

[4:29:36] <KruelDestiny> PogChamp
[4:29:38] <%Hammerknife> pat watch a movie
[4:29:39] <Animorphimagi> ....running kick is the OP move in the game...
[4:29:41] <alexandrecau> kiryu is a bully when you think about it
[4:29:45] <%TheNewJapanGuy> GLASS
[4:29:45] <SilverFaustX> banned
[4:29:46] <%Laecerelius> Into the glass!
[4:29:46] <%VanaSkiller> deaded
[4:29:47] <$Plutt_bug> Take a fight into a shop and wreck the place
[4:29:48] <mr_ESB> Soccer kick
[4:29:48] <Marpolo13> @Kazuhira4 lol you right
[4:29:48] <omen_setter> kicking people into windows never gets old
[4:29:49] <%MagickBurritoh> Dead
[4:29:50] <FatherGreyBeard> OH
[4:29:51] <+Maids4lyfe> PROPERTY DAMAGE
[4:29:52] <count_bob> Fight at the tower.
[4:29:53] <%Laecerelius> That man is Jigsaw now!
[4:29:53] <%MisterTylerrr> Banned!
[4:29:54] <+Spec7re> totally not dead guys
[4:29:56] <@Squishy3> yea, there's like a cafe attached to the millennium tower now too
[4:29:56] <Habblewater> Oh my that dude just waiting casually behind the glass
[4:29:59] <rubbishbinge> B-b-but, Yua is a QT
[4:30:00] <+dramajoe> kurt angle shane mcmahon
[4:30:02] <%spiritofmojave> You are now BANNED from Millennium Tower
[4:30:03] <%MightyMaxT> To people who have beaten this game, how far in until the NJPW gang shows up, roughly? And are they main story or side quest?
[4:30:04] <cajjunb> damn, look at those animations
[4:30:05] <%skizzuto> that dude just casually watching as he gets covered in shattered glass
[4:30:07] <%Kduff89> back to jail i guess
[4:30:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> At higher levels, running kick will instantly end random fights for you if you time it right and they all connect
[4:30:14] <%crimsonharvest> So Kamurocho's local industry and services have to be centered on constantly rebuilding after brawls right?
[4:30:15] <broth_elemental> Yeah,running kick is real strong
[4:30:16] <MacMog> what the hell? +22 to all elemental resistances?
[4:30:16] <Run44forrest> superman punches Work can confirm
[4:30:24] <majima666> you cant be banned from millenium tower , what about the last boss?
[4:30:34] <+Babaggo> do all yakuza games after 2 have no style switching
[4:30:38] <$cureneckbeard> allowing kiryu to smash everything is basically a massive insurance scam
[4:30:42] <%MagickBurritoh> people are cowering
[4:30:45] <ManfredA> style switching is only in 0 and Kiwami
[4:30:50] <+harpsichord_uiy> lol all these dudes just waiting impatiently
[4:30:52] <cajjunb> look at that stagger animation
[4:30:54] <$Plutt_bug> Take a fight into a shop and wreck the place!
[4:31:02] <DeltaD36> Seems a little jank
[4:31:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I bet Daigo and Majima let themselves go to jail so that they could round up forces on the inside to stop the Triad. Majima WOULDN'T go to jail unless there was a reason
[4:31:03] <+daisyyyy> hows the quote go? "If you dont think Kiryu kills people you need to grow up"
[4:31:06] <alexandrecau> nice elbow
[4:31:06] <+Spec7re> Dont forget to get kiryu insurance for your bike
[4:31:07] <ShichiNoBushi> That guy's just standing there casually while you were fighting feet from him.
[4:31:09] <%spiritofmojave> it's a cafe, not a bar LUL
[4:31:09] <physicaldepression> *clap*
[4:31:13] <falconx9k> WHERE'S THE BOOZE
[4:31:14] <SilverFaustX> not banned LUL
[4:31:14] <ManfredA> to be completely honest
[4:31:16] <%Laecerelius> You need food anyway
[4:31:17] <Animorphimagi> I just realized that hard mode in this game might make enemies block 300% more often. because I needed to do running kick to get around their constant blocking
[4:31:17] <Habblewater> i love how they just freeze in mid air and fall to the ground like a bag of shit, momentum deleted.
[4:31:18] <+harpsichord_uiy> its a cafe duderino

[5:06:05] <%Kataguro> He's still getting his ass beat. Doesn't matter if it was an accident
[5:06:06] <Halospaz117> YES SHE DID
[5:06:07] <%crimsonharvest> If it was me profiling, i would say its some junior shitlord bullied into doing the hit and run and he was losing it during
[5:06:07] <Habblewater> Kid was a toddler
[5:06:10] <falconx9k> She's only alive because she absorbed Kiryu's Yakuza cells

[5:08:14] <StromkoPenguin> Kiryu's going to pull a Liam Neeson, prowling around the streets with a bat :(
[5:08:17] <%Laecerelius> You can easily track him by the trail of piss and shit he's leaving behind
[5:08:17] <Soliloquy123> Friendly reminder that Kiryu never killed anyone

[5:19:45] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat According to the localization team for Yakuza, their headcanon for Walking Erection is that he’s actually a tulpa of Kiryu’s insecurity as a virgin and Majima’s depravity from being surrounded by girls all day

[5:42:36] <Snarksmith> mahjong is a scam and the rules are made up
[5:42:36] <a_mad_dragon> mahjong is just rummy with weird dominoes instead of cards

So why do people want money? Why would you want affluent wealth pat? The only reason I could see myself wanting money is to buy a fancy suit, cane, monocle, and top hat, so I could violently throw money at people while calling them filthy peasants or guttersnipes. I guess it's not too far off from what I do with pat though...

[5:58:17] <fmc009> is he trying to mid max even before getting the baby?
[5:58:26] <%Futurecity10> @bear_breaker20 He was a taxi driver in 5
[5:58:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hifumi better be a party member in P5R
[5:58:31] <ミュウレ4242> there's a lot to spend xp on. entire mechanics you haven't touched, even.
[5:58:34] <%waifoong98> @bear_breaker20 I mean, being in Jail for so long might as well not have one

[6:00:08] <SiegeJay> Is Brawler the only Move set you get?
[6:00:12] <+McSnazzyPants> i think that's a statue
[6:00:17] <alexandrecau> it's Kiryu's final story he should have all his moves
[6:00:18] <%spiritofmojave> @Youwereeatenbyalid He's just a n g e r e y

[6:00:28] <Zombrocom> @SiegeJay I think this Dragon style actually, but yes

[6:20:38] <physicaldepression> yes
[6:20:39] <%nitronLVIII> Majidown
[6:20:39] <Zombrocom> Yes
[6:20:39] <DarkOmen98> option 3
[6:20:40] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> less intimidating than either though
[6:20:40] <rubbishbinge> What a pure soul
[6:20:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Majidown, Shakejima
[6:20:43] <+Tokanova> both!
[6:20:43] <+C24U> Shakedown was a threat right from the start
[6:20:44] <%BeardedLuchador> neither
[6:20:45] <+Tokanova> :)
[6:20:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shakejima
[6:20:49] <physicaldepression> arent they the same?
[6:20:49] <%Cthulos> you're his Majima Pat

[6:20:58] <RadSuit> Mashake Jimadown
[6:21:01] <mr_ESB> Hell show up on the map as a purple arrow
[6:21:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @Cthulos that's the best way to put it
[6:21:02] <person181> street fights become easy fast
[6:21:02] <+bear_breaker20> Lmao this guy, so many characters motivation is just mone masked as something else LUL
[6:21:04] <%castcode> did he just
[6:21:07] <majindusto> MAJIDOWN
[6:21:08] <alcors_wisdom> @Spec7re its been 30 years since shake down appeared plenty of time to raise a kid
[6:21:09] <ミュウレ4242> the man who became too strong.
[6:21:24] <tj_timbs> well good luck
[6:21:24] <Travian_Valoris> thats gonna be hard
[6:21:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @physicaldepression no Shadedown roamed the map and would mug you if he saw you. Majima just pops out of no where
[6:21:29] <ミュウレ4242> alleys and rooftops.
[6:21:29] <DashXero> Can't help.
[6:21:31] <%spiritofmojave> That's not that easy
[6:21:31] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh jeez, I never got them all
[6:21:32] <hntronium> TOJO TIME next time
[6:21:36] <person181> are they random?
[6:21:36] <+C24U> Any clues on map?
[6:21:37] <+Hokepoke> MEW
[6:21:37] <gluemanofficial> Do catgirls count?

[6:21:41] <%ssjklyco> Pat Stares at Neko
[6:21:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thats gonna be hard
[6:21:42] <Desertfishing> look next to you
[6:21:45] <takiyami> they're mostly in back alleys
[6:21:46] <xeros720> pat is really staying up tonight
[6:21:46] <切捨御免> you just killed tachibana
[6:21:47] <+ahegotrigger> we have to help Pat find some Pussy boys
[6:21:50] <%nitronLVIII> neko wa doko desu ka
[6:21:54] <fluffypupperino> Theres a cat near Kiyushi #1 Star
[6:21:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @physicaldepression Think Reaper in Persona 3
[6:21:56] <Travian_Valoris> pink st is probably you best bet
[6:21:58] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think by where one of the old cabaret club locations...
[6:22:01] <%Remery_> punching him when's he down
[6:22:01] <tank7013> @AngriestPat Not 100% sure but I wanna say there's one around the pawn shop
[6:22:06] <alcors_wisdom> go check the internet cafe i heard you can get mad pussy there
[6:22:09] <dero45> Listen closely for pussy noises
[6:22:09] <Travian_Valoris> or near serena
[6:22:16] <%spiritofmojave> They have like timed spawn points I think
[6:22:17] <%MisterTylerrr> Whoever said something about Zack, fuck you. I combed through Matt's Twitter for fine minutes and all I saw was MK news.
[6:22:18] <fluffypupperino> They spawn randomly tho
[6:22:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think you can hear a cat meow, but honestly Elmo might sabotage you there
[6:22:28] <StromkoPenguin> Random thugs are like starbucks, two on every corner
[6:22:29] <Smaenus> You can look up a map, its semi random and a huge pain in the ass to complete
[6:22:31] <AzirothTheGreat> theyre a bit random
[6:22:32] <切捨御免> OOF
[6:22:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> Kiryu kills everyone
[6:22:37] <Dr_Mooose> fractured skull
[6:22:44] <+C24U> How are Kiryu's clothes not stained red?
[6:22:55] <%Prevot> @C24U shhhhh
[6:22:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Wouldn't be a bad idea if you looked up the locations tbh
[6:22:56] <%ALTRNico> !uptime
[6:22:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 22m.
[6:22:58] <majindusto> Zack Fair.._not Matt's Zack
[6:22:59] <%ssjklyco> his shirt is
[6:23:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:23:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> You beat their ass so hard they despawned
[6:23:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> y u no repeat knees
[6:23:09] <+bear_breaker20> @C24U Because hes the good duy Kappa
[6:23:10] <Travian_Valoris> will hear meowing if theres one close
[6:23:10] <%Cthulos> lots and lots of scotch guard
[6:23:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> get glasses, Pat
[6:23:12] <+bear_breaker20> Guy*
[6:23:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> I often confuse Cats with Soda machines
[6:23:14] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a drink-dispensing cat
[6:23:15] <%Prevot> it that a cat? no it's a plastic bag
[6:23:17] <Animorphimagi> ALLEYES
[6:23:19] <%ssjklyco> cat vending machine
[6:23:24] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I remember some in the south east by the cafe to kinda tutorialize me
[6:23:30] <切捨御免> uhh
[6:23:32] <xeros720> i always heard the cats before i saw em
[6:23:33] <切捨御免> is that lady okay?
[6:23:33] <mojokingizakku> that lady uh
[6:23:38] <%DedlokPM> Confusing a vending machine for a cat is even worse than thinking a bag is a dog. mogsShook
[6:23:39] <person181> sturdy doors they have there
[6:23:39] <DashXero> Look at that lady in the background!
[6:23:40] <Solidus_113> I'd say check around Pink Street
[6:23:40] <majindusto> PUSSYEYES
[6:23:41] <%skizzuto> that lady bugging out in the background LUL
[6:23:42] <Zombrocom> Hey lady
[6:23:44] <Zombrocom> Are you ok
[6:23:51] <+C24U> Sega is back!
[6:23:57] <alcors_wisdom> sega does what nintendont
[6:23:57] <%ssjklyco> that lady is broken
[6:23:59] <%MisterTylerrr> That's an achievement in every game
[6:24:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 here's som messages from other peeps in chat. OUTSOURCING HO! wsintai: "Kiryu, you smell like Daddy's drinks too!" InstiGaitan: im gonna suck ur bag pat majindusto: NOTICE ME tho Prevot: oh no pat is taking off his belt Run44forrest: wtf he got HOTTER
[6:24:03] <+Grayhammatter> SEGA
[6:24:03] <silvcrest> We are finally free from SEGA
[6:24:06] <a_mad_dragon> i want kiryo to fight segata sanshiro
[6:24:08] <%spiritofmojave> SEGA thuggery
[6:24:13] <SeruraRenge> This game's combat system follows the teachings of Cobra Kai: sweep the leg
[6:24:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DedlokPM Listen, it was in the middle of the road and it looked like a dog from behind
[6:24:16] <%Cthulos> @dedlokpm what if you confuse a bag for a cat
[6:24:27] <%ssjklyco> Sega does what Nintendont, appears on competitors console
[6:24:38] <majindusto> Kiryu would lose to Segata
[6:24:40] <xeros720> meal exp is best exp
[6:24:42] <%skizzuto> jesus there's a fight every block
[6:24:44] <+C24U> Do fights scare away cats?
[6:24:44] <Run44forrest> cool thanks?
[6:24:54] <+Spec7re> shiny
[6:24:58] <Travian_Valoris> @C24U yep
[6:25:04] <Monkeyweed21> look in the empty lot
[6:25:05] <Travian_Valoris> despawns them
[6:25:08] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I need to sleep for an appointment, good luck with cat hunting Pat!
[6:25:09] <+bear_breaker20> Kiryu would beat up shoko asahara
[6:25:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> Give me all of your food please
[6:25:11] <%Niney_Who> Sweet and sour Pork Kreygasm
[6:25:18] <%Cthulos> @majindusto oh my god segata sanshiro would be amazing in Yakuza
[6:25:27] <%Xooler67> give all bacon and eggs you have
[6:25:29] <42nfl19> Wait they don't have transitions when entering stores anymore??!!!??!?
[6:25:35] <ミュウレ4242> segata sanshiro in smash when?
[6:25:35] <alcors_wisdom> this is basically calorie counting the video game
[6:25:38] <%Niney_Who> That was a LOT OF XP
[6:25:43] <DarkOmen98> i kinda miss FF15 for the food porn
[6:25:44] <Monkeyweed21> go to empty lot
[6:25:51] <mr_ESB> I forget the meal combos for exp bonuses
[6:25:51] <Travian_Valoris> Only between maps
[6:25:53] <alcors_wisdom> except when you enter/leave an arcade game
[6:25:54] <Solidus_113> empty lot doesn't exist dude
[6:25:54] <$Plutt_bug> This game is the future
[6:25:55] <%Niney_Who> The empty lot is Millenium Tower
[6:25:55] <Travian_Valoris> or taxis
[6:25:57] <%nmaten> thats the best change imo
[6:25:58] <Desertfishing> smooth sailing
[6:26:00] <majindusto> Segata was in Project X Zone 2 with Kiryu and Majima
[6:26:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> empty lot is the tower
[6:26:02] <+Deano8817> one big loading screen to boot up the world, then youre good
[6:26:10] <+bear_breaker20> Food porn is a luxery in video games and that NOT RIGHT
[6:26:10] <RadSuit> Goons?
[6:26:12] <%DedlokPM> @Cthulos just as bad
[6:26:16] <%Ranger747> @DarkOmen98 Theirs some good stuff in Kingdom Hearts 3. Thanks Square Enix
[6:26:18] <%nmaten> coming from yakuza 1 the transitions into fights were unbearable
[6:26:25] <SeruraRenge> I'm half expecting a car to tip over when you bump into it
[6:26:30] <切捨御免> SHINOBI EXECUTION
[6:26:32] <%Cthulos> is segata a spirit or trophy in smash?
[6:26:35] <Travian_Valoris> triad goons
[6:26:40] <$Plutt_bug> green gang
[6:26:44] <%Niney_Who> I see a shiny thing
[6:26:46] <%ALTRNico> Chinese fuckers are tough
[6:26:51] <切捨御免> LUL
[6:26:54] <+C24U> Where's Kiryu's scissor kick?
[6:26:56] <Dr_Mooose> from the cut
[6:27:02] <Travian_Valoris> grab is good on them
[6:27:03] <+bear_breaker20> Suits*
[6:27:09] <%ssjklyco> are they just using Haki
[6:27:15] <majindusto> Kingdom Hearts 3 ending was Great...Just beat it yesterday
[6:27:15] <+bear_breaker20> The sharper the suit the stronger you become
[6:27:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> damn those evil chinese
[6:27:18] <%MisterTylerrr> The way he makes them slide for like 10 yards down the street makes him look like a god damn superhero
[6:27:32] <+Deano8817> roman reigns would be proud of all those superman punches
[6:27:33] <+C24U> He knows Kung Fu!
[6:27:43] <$Plutt_bug> Mo
[6:27:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> woop woop woop
[6:27:48] <+Spec7re> Stop moving asshole!
[6:27:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pull your Kiryu trigger
[6:27:49] <Desertfishing> his kung fu is stronk
[6:27:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rip Mo
[6:27:57] <%Remery_> into the pole
[6:27:58] <Smaenus> DEMPSEY ROLLU
[6:28:00] <DarkOmen98> kung fu your way outta that shit asshole
[6:28:02] <%Ranger747> @majindusto Straight up. The story was more straight forward than I could have imagined
[6:28:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> KNEES

[6:28:29] <切捨御免> holy fuck
[6:28:32] <DarkOmen98> what chapter are you on @AngriestPat ?
[6:28:34] <Dr_Mooose> bye sword
[6:28:37] <+C24U> That sword went flying
[6:28:37] <切捨御免> that sword went back to its home planet
[6:28:40] <Zombrocom> @DarkOmen98 2
[6:28:52] <mr_ESB> Maybe the alleyway around the cat cafe building?
[6:28:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> B E A S T
[6:28:55] <DarkOmen98> ahh i don't think cats are on the streets yet in that chapter
[6:29:03] <+bear_breaker20> Kiryu uses the ripple and doesnt even notice what it is LUL @doc_ock_rokc
[6:29:05] <+C24U> 2
[6:29:05] <+Grayhammatter> 2

[6:29:18] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I found most cats after you have to go somewhere else
[6:29:18] <%ssjklyco> 2
[6:29:20] <takiyami> give yourself some credit, you're on 2
[6:29:20] <Travian_Valoris> weird
[6:29:23] <DarkOmen98> they come a bit later when more things open up
[6:29:26] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @AngriestPat I just heard a dolphin noise; someone said earlier that that meant cats were nearby.
[6:29:27] <physicaldepression> crazy talk activated
[6:29:28] <DisGuyOvahEre> crazy talk strikes again
[6:29:28] <+Koover> does this game have a pc release?
[6:29:28] <knyttstories> 1 = 2
[6:29:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bear_breaker20 He hasn't seen anyone else use the ripple in any of the weird jojo ways
[6:29:31] <dero45> Still in tutorial
[6:29:31] <DRAGKUDO> was that a shujin student/
[6:29:31] <Jontman42> Literally not the same thing
[6:29:32] <Desertfishing> 1 = 2
[6:29:32] <%ssjklyco> nooo
[6:29:35] <%Cthulos> What if Nintendo were to build a Sega mini console like the NES or SNES?
[6:29:36] <+Spec7re> Where the kitty at
[6:29:41] <count_bob> There's a cat one street over to the east
[6:29:42] <majindusto> KH3s Epologue and Secret Ending reveals got huge reactions from both me and my friends
[6:29:46] <Dr_Mooose> Kiryu vision
[6:29:51] <count_bob> Sometimes.
[6:29:53] <%Cthulos> make it both saturn and dreamcast
[6:29:54] <takiyami> look for spots like the alley behind Serena
[6:29:56] <+ahegotrigger> eat the catfood assert Dominance
[6:29:56] <+C24U> First person achievement lol
[6:30:01] <SeruraRenge> aw no first person combat?
[6:30:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mallet space
[6:30:04] <Travian_Valoris> mallet space
[6:30:05] <%ALTRNico> @AngriestPat you'll here mews if you're near a cat
[6:30:05] <+RamblingRyno> I really need to play this series if they have a mission where you look for a lost kitty
[6:30:10] <%Cthulos> or do it separately
[6:30:11] <+bear_breaker20> @doc_ock_rokc He just assumes anyone can do that shit if they hit the gym lol
[6:30:35] <Animorphimagi> ALLEYS
[6:30:35] <spicelord42069> meow
[6:30:36] <%spiritofmojave> We're never finding a cat folks 🦀
[6:30:37] <Run44forrest> ask Hiji where cat
[6:30:41] <%Das_Bass> you can look up a cheat map where they hang out @AngriestPat
[6:30:44] <%Ultradoom333> Ultradoom333 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[6:30:45] <knyttstories> You'll hear Muse? Better tell Woolie
[6:30:45] <%supersugoisenpai1> Don't park your motorcycle in Kamurocho
[6:30:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Look at that Shakedown Jr
[6:31:14] <DashXero> That dark alley looks like a place that would have cats.
[6:31:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Knee their noses out the backs of their heads
[6:31:17] <Animorphimagi> oh right. weapons are OP in this game
[6:31:25] <切捨御免> KUSO
[6:31:34] <Run44forrest> did that guy just slap kiryus ass
[6:31:46] <%Cthulos> weapons would be op in Kiryu's hands
[6:31:58] <mojokingizakku> so far kiryu took two sword slashes and a sledge hit and he's walking around feeling fine
[6:32:00] <Solidus_113> might be worth putting on that avoid battles gear item
[6:32:09] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Pat. The stray Cat milk is located just above the Nyan Nyan Cafe according to the map I looked up
[6:32:12] <majindusto> Haruka's Hit and Run tourist Spot
[6:32:13] <%ocelotshotfirst> Check near the cat cafe
[6:32:20] <fluffypupperino> the stomp?
[6:32:31] <fluffypupperino> pretty sure there are no ground heat move
[6:32:32] <Run44forrest> akiyama help im trying to find haruka but im dummy thick and the clap of my asscheeks is alerting triads
[6:32:35] <%Prevot> this game is missing heat moves in general
[6:32:39] <Travian_Valoris> @AngriestPat there's a good map if you google it, but you'll probs need the silent shoes equivalent so you dont get harassed while looking
[6:32:41] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> a lot of heat moves are kinda gone
[6:32:46] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> moved into regular moves
[6:32:56] <alexandrecau> tiger crash
[6:32:57] <+bear_breaker20> Why? who knows...
[6:32:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Face Stomp?
[6:33:00] <%TheNewJapanGuy> You went by it
[6:33:02] <SilverInferno3> Was it not Essence of Face Stomp?
[6:33:05] <mr_ESB> Oh stomp moved to Kiwami 2
[6:33:06] <physicaldepression> it was there
[6:33:07] <%spiritofmojave> It's already in your kit I think
[6:33:09] <fluffypupperino> u do get tiger drop tho
[6:33:10] <Basch71> you already can otg enemies anyway
[6:33:10] <%Niney_Who> Essence of Face Stomp
[6:33:12] <broth_elemental> Essence of ace stomp
[6:33:14] <+bear_breaker20> No Skateboard wahoo for Kiryu...
[6:33:14] <Animorphimagi> ground stomp was WAAAY too OP
[6:33:16] <SiegeJay> Pat is BLIND!
[6:33:16] <DatAsuna> Essence of face stomp is a stomp
[6:33:18] <DisGuyOvahEre> @AngriestPat you may not have stop but you have that cool mario grab throw
[6:33:18] <xeros720> essence of face stomp?
[6:33:23] <broth_elemental> It was right there
[6:33:24] <DisGuyOvahEre> *stomp
[6:33:26] <SiegeJay> Pat is Blind! he did not see it
[6:33:34] <physicaldepression> crazy vision
[6:33:36] <Travian_Valoris> alot of heat moves got moved to extreme heat mode
[6:33:41] <Travian_Valoris> its kinda weird
[6:33:41] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Face Stomp, in here, is not the stomp he is thinking of, he was thinking of the one that was like a guaranteed heat move as long as you are near someone on the ground
[6:33:48] <%spiritofmojave> Not quite it, huh
[6:33:49] <takiyami> there should be a cat by ebisu actually
[6:33:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> huh
[6:33:51] <%Niney_Who> huh
[6:33:52] <%spiritofmojave> Weird
[6:33:53] <SiegeJay> WAH!!!!
[6:33:54] <+dtogo> its not in this game
[6:33:56] <Dr_Mooose> weird
[6:33:57] <+BaronEgo> There's a lot of heat moves in 6 you'll rarely/never see
[6:33:57] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Look
[6:34:01] <%Das_Bass> they got rid of my fav, essence of smoking
[6:34:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Essence of repeating knee is WAY better
[6:34:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Could of sworn I saw him stepping a guy's face in one those, did catch the name
[6:34:13] <Animorphimagi> it was OP
[6:34:14] <DatAsuna> essence of smoking is good, but the stove is best
[6:34:14] <AzirothTheGreat> it's tiger crash in this game
[6:34:14] <SiegeJay> @Das_Bass Me too....
[6:34:17] <xeros720> man, so many extreme heat moves
[6:34:20] <Travian_Valoris> free money
[6:34:22] <SilverInferno3> Huh weird, i thought I saw one where he stomps a dude on the ground
[6:34:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> didn't* I'm tired
[6:34:28] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Instead of getting a guaranteed heat move on a grounded guy, your new best option, I found, is to do a running kick into them launching them hopefully into another dude.
[6:34:30] <%supersugoisenpai1> Majima nowhere system
[6:34:33] <mr_ESB> from a regular grab heat kiryu does a stomp
[6:34:36] <majima666> essence of smoking was the shit
[6:34:36] <%Das_Bass> essence of smoking wasso dope
[6:34:40] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> there is a face stomp on the double takedown heatmove
[6:34:51] <SiegeJay> @Das_Bass favorite way to end all fights is with Essense of Smoking but Smoking Bad!
[6:34:54] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> kinda guranteed and strong on grab
[6:34:58] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Stray cat "Milk" is located at the Senyu Ave. on the Map Screen
[6:35:03] <DingusMcBaseball> SourPls
[6:35:04] <mr_ESB> Dragon crash i think its called
[6:35:07] <DashXero> That man is probably sick of that song.
[6:35:07] <+dtogo> its fine extreme heat in this game is OP anyway
[6:35:09] <%castcode> Fly High Like a Butterfly
[6:35:12] <xeros720> getting into more fights?
[6:35:14] <%Kingtut9009> That makes them more likely to fight you doesn't it?
[6:35:16] <SilverInferno3> Wait you want more random encounters?
[6:35:22] <SilverInferno3> Cause that's what the photo does
[6:35:23] <%Das_Bass> yeah they got rid of it since SMOKING BAD
[6:35:30] <Travian_Valoris> up slightly
[6:35:31] <takiyami> according to the map I'm looking at, the cat is just off that little circle, maybe a little closer to club sega
[6:35:44] <SilverInferno3> Lmao
[6:35:49] <Run44forrest> does kiryu not smoke while idle anymore?
[6:35:50] <Travian_Valoris> corner of senryo and pink
[6:35:50] <%Prevot> LUL
[6:35:51] <mr_ESB> They replaced smoking with a chopstick move
[6:35:51] <%skizzuto> the orphan photo is what you want I think
[6:35:54] <MacMog> make Kiryu eat the photo
[6:35:56] <%Kingtut9009> The first item you have reduces it
[6:36:16] <SilverInferno3> No one would fight a man interested in orphans!
[6:36:34] <%Kisabuza> play virtual fighter
[6:36:38] <%Kingtut9009> apatLiz
[6:36:39] <+dtogo> he had the charismatic photo on? no wonder he was getting attacked alot
[6:36:44] <%Kisabuza> virtua*
[6:36:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nyan ;3
[6:36:45] <Travian_Valoris> might have to area transition to get them to spawn
[6:36:45] <%Das_Bass> i think some only come out at night
[6:36:50] <SilverInferno3> @dtogo No, he just bought it
[6:36:51] <mojokingizakku> play the DoA machines
[6:37:04] <%Prevot> he already played DoA
[6:37:07] <gluemanofficial> I want a Yakuza item where it's just a sign that says "I'm Kiryu" and it makes people not want to fight you
[6:37:09] <%dorthafiq> they got rid of the smoking because in 2016 you can't smoke in public anymore
[6:37:14] <%spiritofmojave> mhmm try refresh
[6:37:15] <mojokingizakku> oh i didn't know there we a thing actually

[6:37:30] <Sielas> Does pat run into people on purpoise?
[6:37:30] <Travian_Valoris> like you've walked through 3 areas where they'r esupposed to be already
[6:37:34] <%Das_Bass> 2016
[6:37:39] <megakruemel> huh
[6:37:40] <alcors_wisdom> i wouldnt expect riding a taxi would count as a transition
[6:37:41] <+dtogo> @SilverInferno3 do you still get stunlocked in this game by grunts when its on?
[6:37:44] <+C24U> @AngriestPat Slightly North of the Nyan Nyan Cafe
[6:37:46] <SeruraRenge> @megakruemel The games always take place in the year they're released
[6:37:50] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @gluemanofficial and the only characters that can wear the sign are NOT Kiryu
[6:37:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> Time to sleep

[6:38:39] <SilverInferno3> god that hurts tow atch
[6:38:43] <+AccioSkullar> he super died
[6:38:43] <fIashman92> Cats are semi RNG
[6:38:46] <MacMog> don’t cheat on Elmo with digital cats
[6:38:51] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah do the kick while running full speed, it's a good kick usually

[6:39:03] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> like you can send dudes into other dudes
[6:39:04] <Travian_Valoris> 6 & 0 are equal favourites
[6:39:07] <fIashman92> Cats don't always show up, like real cats
[6:39:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> sing the Nishiki karaoke before you go
[6:39:19] <megakruemel> *whispers* anynoone even

[6:39:54] <%Niney_Who> You really may just have to transition
[6:39:55] <%castcode> Millions dead as man barrels his way through Kamurocho
[6:39:57] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> most satisfying start of a fight for me is to grab a guy, throw him into the mosh pit, then run up and sweep kick the front guy on the ground into everyone getting up
[6:39:58] <physicaldepression> yakuza 4 and kiwami 2 are honestly the best
[6:40:20] <physicaldepression> ded
[6:40:23] <%Niney_Who> POWERBOMB
[6:40:24] <%castcode> He's fine tho
[6:40:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> Maybe when you quit and reload, there will be cats
[6:40:28] <Dr_Mooose> powerbomb!
[6:40:29] <+dtogo> They finally changed that guys face in Judgemant. Haven't even played the game and already miss the old face.
[6:40:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> R Knee as Ono Michio is the absolute best ever
[6:40:37] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[6:40:40] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think that was Elmo tho
[6:40:42] <megakruemel> I can't believe Japan hasn't solved it's rampant thug problem in 2016
[6:40:43] <Travian_Valoris> just randos screaming
[6:40:47] <AzirothTheGreat> you have to progress story
[6:40:49] <%Prevot> it's elmo

[6:40:49] <physicaldepression> fat dude is going ham
[6:40:50] <+ArmoredRevenger> that guy is fucking you up
[6:40:53] <fIashman92> Cats don't always show up, it's semi RNG
[6:40:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatPorgmo
[6:40:54] <majima666> will it be a day one patch or will they ship the game with the updated model
[6:41:07] <metallic_snake> looking to get into the yakuza series, do i start at 0 and work from there?
[6:41:08] <Travian_Valoris> its a really blatent meow

[6:42:00] <Travian_Valoris> maybe
[6:42:13] <+Nighttimenoctis> is this new?
[6:42:13] <fIashman92> Cats don't always show up. It's semi rng
[6:42:13] <mr_ESB> That cat is rare i think
[6:42:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its easier to find cats in Hiroshima since its a small map
[6:42:20] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Its sort of random chance

[6:54:34] <mr_ESB> Does atlus still have that no stream rule thing?
[6:54:43] <SilverInferno3> It was barely enforced anyways
[6:54:47] <%nmaten> @Das_Bass from my understanding theres STILL a date limit on what you can stream
[6:54:53] <%Das_Bass> wow

[7:07:55] <%Kirby_Sauce> I meant AFFLUENT wealth. Like, why do people want too much money to be reasonable
[7:08:04] <SilverInferno3> Rip
[7:08:05] <laguerrilha> @Kirby_Sauce then give the money to who arent dead as well
[7:08:09] <%waifoong98> @Kirby_Sauce Greed basically...
[7:08:11] <mr_ESB> Did Pat get the drinking glasses that came with this game?
[7:08:23] <Run44forrest> dont say that stop
[7:08:35] <%madhattergay> @Kirby_Sauce violence and greed
[7:08:36] <%nmaten> its clearly not the same guy cause our pat knows nothing about music
[7:08:55] <+bear_breaker20> Having more money than someone could be a self turn on for someone...
[7:08:58] <Run44forrest> why
[7:09:00] <laguerrilha> @Kirby_Sauce i want a LOT of money to live and not just survive each month. be free of the fear of not being able to survive each month

[7:09:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> @kirby_sauce I don't want affluent wealth. if I had it, I'd use it to fuck with people. give hobos ten grand and all that. have a suit made out of Big Bird material.

[7:09:31] <artoflec> its worth doing because the proper Bravely Default ending is amazing
