[0:36:29] <%iraqi_food_cart> iraqi_food_cart subscribed with Prime.

[0:36:33] <TaurusGirl_Productions> The ghost is a cat confirmed
[0:36:36] <@GrandSalamancer> Interesting game.
[0:36:38] <%blasphazar> You have to flex your gay boi energy and then drink the dew of the universe to sprint
[0:36:41] <$happyface699> GHOST DOG
[0:36:42] <realzodiackiller> Bro I want to help you, I can't. I googled it, no one else said anything, and I don't fucking play video games.
[0:36:57] <TaurusGirl_Productions> Ghost Dad, is that you?
[0:37:14] <$happyface699> Not ghost dad
[0:37:17] <clyde_the_coyoat> Radio: put your left hand next to your head and touch the trigger
[0:37:25] <$happyface699> NO BILL
[0:37:28] <$happyface699> PLEASE
[0:37:40] <TaurusGirl_Productions> NO MORE PUDDIN' POPS PLSS
[0:37:48] <+storebrandcandy> piss wisp
[0:38:29] <+Scevda> Clyde confirmed
[0:38:31] <realzodiackiller> No, Sikkab tell Adum what Clyde just said, that's different from what you said.
[0:38:35] <accusedphoenix> i read that its using the trigger on your left shoulder but i can't confirm, i dont have one myself @AdumPlaze
[0:38:37] <benjiFG> just like in real life!
[0:38:49] <$happyface699> this summer starring bill cosby and kevin spacy directed by brian singer comes the most anticipated thriller of the yr “PLEASE NO”
[0:38:55] <%Rollergator> i google about radio: Should be left shoulder, then trigger.
[0:38:57] <@GrandSalamancer> Sanity pills?
[0:39:03] <TaurusGirl_Productions> I only know the keyboard control, not VR sadly
[0:39:15] <@GrandSalamancer> wtf are sanity pills?
[0:39:20] <TaurusGirl_Productions> @GrandSalamancer Restores sanity as it goes down
[0:39:41] <$happyface699> Wah wah
[0:39:50] <Bored610> GET THE SANITY PILLS ALREADY
[0:39:50] <mousetrapmouse> I am also touching all over my body
[0:39:51] <%blasphazar> Adam molests himself in real time
[0:39:55] <+Dingalow> Holy shit, VR controls sound garbage
[0:39:57] <TaurusGirl_Productions> Sanity's determined by the ghost appearing in front of the player, and I think you can die if sanity reaches 0%?
[0:40:01] <@GrandSalamancer> @TaurusGirl_Productions I get that. I just think the idea of getting sanity back through pill is really funny.
[0:40:10] <accusedphoenix> try your nipples adum ;o;
[0:40:15] <StaticSunrise> DEEP in the NECC
[0:40:17] <%magical_bara> scoot wasnt coming today right?

[0:41:10] <+Dingalow> This is really spooky
[0:41:33] <$happyface699> Guys my armpits smell like pancakes. Makes sense i had some earlier
[0:41:33] <anotherguycalledjohn> this is hilarious. the whole stream will be adam figuring how the radio works XD
[0:41:43] <Spagheddies> Adum's molesting himself.
[0:41:51] <theshillman> now fondle it

[0:41:56] <accusedphoenix> omfg LUL

[0:41:58] <$happyface699> Fondle that shit
[0:41:58] <SweetCheeksTVR> Reach right into your prostate
[0:42:00] <+Dingalow> VR is the future of gaming
[0:42:00] <vicehara> What a great game
[0:42:04] <mousetrapmouse> touch it from behind
[0:42:05] <TaurusGirl_Productions> @anotherguycalledjohn Plot twist: the radio IS the true horror in this game!
[0:42:07] <vicehara> GOTY
[0:42:09] <%sumario> adum figuring out this game is like old people figuring out technology
[0:42:11] <mousetrapmouse> that's what daddy likes
[0:42:11] <+FrankStalloned> Left ear
[0:42:18] <$happyface699> GAME OF THE DECADE
[0:42:21] <+FrankStalloned> Hold trigger
[0:42:29] <theshillman> HIS RADIO HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO EAT HIS HAND!
[0:42:30] <%willERROR343> this is adum's kink
[0:42:33] <Spagheddies> Damn, Gael's character really does look like Gael.
[0:42:34] <SweetCheeksTVR> To be fair, this game is SUPER FUCKING JANK IN VR
[0:42:34] <sycaphany> LUL LUL LUL
[0:42:36] <theshillman> it hungers... FOR MORE
[0:42:38] <+IceDragonCal> the sexual tension
[0:42:38] <anotherguycalledjohn> this game's pretty cool, but the vr controls seem bullsht
[0:42:39] <accusedphoenix> spooky game of twister LUL LUL LUL
[0:42:45] <Pinesolbb> maybe the real radio was the friends we made along the way
[0:43:02] <$happyface699> Get outa here joeseph gordon levitt
[0:43:05] <+c0nk3r_16> this is dumb, you should play on keyboard
[0:43:13] <bushyasta911> Well now it’s no longer chats turn to guide Adum
[0:43:19] <kouda_ha> Looking up VR controls and there's apparently controller bindings
[0:43:28] <kouda_ha> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wpwTfav1a8 This dude is going on about VR controls!
[0:43:29] <realzodiackiller> Adum should just not play VR, he's too tall.
[0:43:30] <Garthunox> discord kinda ruins the charm of the game
[0:43:35] <realzodiackiller> For this game I mean.
[0:43:51] <$happyface699> Im also too tall for vr
[0:44:11] <kouda_ha> Can he go to a menu? There's "Controller Bindings" which might help him figure out VR??
[0:44:16] <Daskolin> Ghost jam radio anyway, when it hunts.
[0:44:17] <anotherguycalledjohn> he just lost his whole sanity tryna find the damn radio
[0:44:23] <TaurusGirl_Productions> Lol I love how they lost sanity after trying to learn how to use the radio
[0:44:25] <bushyasta911> Gobble gobble gobble
[0:44:37] <Bored610> Can't wait to see Adam impale something with that crucifix LMAO
[0:44:37] <$happyface699> Freddys comin for you
[0:44:48] <vicehara> OMG the telly

[0:46:11] <%shahbothe> adum's having fun
[0:46:13] <+TheNewZealandStory> perhaps not worth trying to play this in vr
[0:46:22] <+OhHaiMarks> “What is that?!” “I think that’s just the television.” “Oh ok maybe.”
[0:46:38] <$happyface699> Its aiden
[0:46:40] <anotherguycalledjohn> @TheNewZealandStory probably not with its current control setup.
[0:46:52] <$happyface699> Hes mad at willam dafoe
[0:46:57] <bushyasta911> So chat what are your bets that these rascals will actually get stuff done

[0:47:25] <+Dingalow> That beep sounds like a far off alarm clock going off
[0:47:39] <vicehara> Betty White?
[0:47:40] <bushyasta911> I bet they run out in the first sign of something spooky
[0:47:47] <$happyface699> Betty
[0:47:50] <%ted_mackey> why elizabeth gotta be white
[0:47:51] <TaurusGirl_Productions> @bushyasta911 I feel like they'll get stuff done until they see a ghost and say FUCK IT WE DONE
[0:48:01] <%willERROR343> betty white died in miami
[0:48:06] <sycaphany> it couldn't be Elizabeth Black
[0:48:08] <$happyface699> Frenchy from the boys

[0:50:23] <Bored610> She walked right through him LMAO
[0:50:25] <$happyface699> Bar graph
[0:50:33] <TaurusGirl_Productions> He should probably switch to keyboard after this bc VR just ain't doin' shiz
[0:50:35] <Bored610> Maybe she's a ghost too
[0:50:51] <@GrandSalamancer> cuz u scared
[0:50:51] <Daskolin> Yeah. Vr on this game is not finished. Even devs don't recommend using it
[0:50:56] <0ddnova> is it his insanity?
[0:50:56] <bushyasta911> Well it looks like one of us has to change
[0:50:57] <$happyface699> Paige died drinking mustard and is a ghost
[0:51:00] <+storebrandcandy> yo lizzy what up
[0:51:02] <StarvingMillennia> He should not be that slow
[0:51:06] <vicehara> Oh no
[0:51:11] <realzodiackiller> @GrandSalamancer It's really well done, like it literally sounds good. I want to get that as like an audio plugin.
[0:51:18] <+MotterDotter> cant wait for Adum to die... in Phasmophobia
[0:51:33] <+emilythegherkin> thosee1PstlCoco thosee1PstlCoco
[0:51:45] <$happyface699> @motterdotter Remember to say in the game and its fine
[0:51:51] <Bored610> @GrandSalamancer What makes you say that?
[0:51:56] <$happyface699> I learned that from my favorite tiger
[0:51:57] <+emilythegherkin> Love this game
[0:52:02] <+OhHaiMarks> TableHere
[0:52:06] <benjiFG> tell that to paige
[0:52:34] <$happyface699> Elizabeth!!!
[0:52:43] <@GrandSalamancer> So the game is able to tell you're saying "Elizabeth White"?
[0:52:51] <+MotterDotter> Looks like Adum accidentlly flickering the flashlight himself
[0:52:54] <benjiFG> bloodborne moment
[0:53:00] <$happyface699> They learned from genius kojumbo

[0:53:51] <+MotterDotter> works usually surpsingly well
[0:53:53] <SweetCheeksTVR> @AdumPlaze VR has a glitch with the flashlight where it seems to flicker, but it's not actually because of an in-game event
[0:53:56] <%potofpedals> It's a granny
[0:53:58] <@GrandSalamancer> Wow I actually saw her.
[0:53:58] <realzodiackiller> @Bored610 Yeah that's how "real" ghost hunting works.
[0:54:15] <+OhHaiMarks> Show me them gam gams Elizabeth

[0:55:05] <Bored610> @reaGotcha. I don't watch ghost shows, so maybe that's why my knowledge in that area is clearly lacking LOL.
[0:55:08] <anotherguycalledjohn> THey really need to work on the vr for this...
[0:55:18] <Bored610> Whoops, I meant @realzodiackiller

[5:17:39] <rat_boy1996> Hoodwinked is the best animated movie
[5:17:46] <@imaginaryfanboy> hoodwinking - To be deceived. It actually derives from the practice of placing a hood over the head of a falcon in the Middle Ages when engaged in the sport of falconry. This was done in order to trick the falcon into believing it was nighttime, thus calming the bird down so that one could recover the prey from the bird's talons.
