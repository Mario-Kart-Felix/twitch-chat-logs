[4:06:18] <+pinkdolphin95> That’s exactly why I dropped her after a couple of months
[4:07:13] <+Sareez> you're forced to use EX psycho scheider to reach your 1 hit confirm, which is even more minus and baitable at that point, in those 4 frames of punish, will you get a perfect non confirmable EX psycho scheider?

[5:46:45] <+Shirdel> Josie controls the neutral better, it's hard for Marduk to step or counter
[5:46:58] <Mr_96atl> this matchup isn't bad for duk, he's just not blocking

[5:47:37] <+martialspirit1> can tmarduk just tackle for 50/50s
[5:47:38] <+pinkdolphin95> Controls the neutral by doing strings? I disagree. He can’t just parry and go into takedown
[5:47:46] <Mr_96atl> see
[5:47:50] <+pinkdolphin95> Perfect!!!!! UHHHHHHH
[5:48:02] <+sicoby> oh shit its phatens PogChamp
[5:48:11] <VirtuaPlastic> unsafe jump
[5:48:16] <nabwitch> go for rage!
[5:48:20] <+Shirdel> It's not that simple, if you mess up your parry timing you can get launched easily
[5:48:22] <+pinkdolphin95> Duck and ws3 otherwise he wouldn’t have went downstairs
[5:48:25] <+Shirdel> Josie has a lot of fakeout options
[5:48:48] <+309MJ> did JDCR play yet?
[5:48:49] <Dafidy> Phatens is too risky
[5:48:52] <+Fran357> josie's neutral is so good
[5:48:57] <+ChurroDelight> I wonder if marduk's 2nd head is as big as his first one Kreygasm
[5:49:03] <+Fran357> LUL
[5:49:03] <+ChokoBiscuits> @309MJ JDCR plays at 6
[5:49:07] <tk_TRASHMAN> i can't wait for season 3 marduk majinoBuss
[5:49:08] <+pinkdolphin95> Her options are bad though. You can see the mid from switch, low is slow and duck the high
[5:49:11] <+omar_comin_yo_> not OG unless you played Tekken 1
[5:49:12] <+sicoby> LUL
[5:49:16] <+309MJ> Thx thx @ChokoBiscuits
[5:49:20] <nabwitch> Forget JDCR, the players so far playing good ass Tekken!
[5:49:26] <+martialspirit1> i guess josie has better tools for keeping up offense
[5:49:35] <+sicoby> is that spoodler on the mic?
[5:49:37] <+Fran357> ^
[5:49:44] <+pinkdolphin95> Yeah she’s just good for offense IMO at least.

[5:49:45] <+clydephalinx> Marduk is kinda OP

[6:44:01] <n33t_1337> JDCR ditched AK. and I don't think his buffs saved him either
[6:44:02] <TaiKong> I feel like we'll be seeing this character matchup a lot in S3
[6:44:03] <trunksGurt> PERFECT emilyf1Pog
[6:44:05] <+JusticeSoulTuna> to be fair, Drag is a bit more fun to watch now

[7:36:30] <+big4lil> theyre both aggro with drag i think
[7:36:36] <+southofhades> can't wait for jdcr drag in s3
[7:36:42] <fourohonekay> its gonna be s1 part 2 with nothing but drag and bryan
[7:37:08] <terrywolf1> Now people like Dragunov?
[7:37:15] <JetSetRingoBH> is this brawlhallas Lil Capped?
[7:37:22] <noyd_bird> I don't know about that one @fourohonekay . I think they're gonna show up a bit more but it's not gonna be any worse than Geese, Steve, Kazumi, etc.
[7:37:26] <+big4lil> people will go back to liking geese in s3
[7:37:32] <+martialspirit1> can mavens moves be made safe by doing teleport?
[7:37:35] <thehighdrated1> Did you see the patch notes? @terrywolf1
[7:37:41] <+southofhades> good, precise and controlled play is great to watch.
[7:37:42] <+Silvaaasuitcase> season 1 everyone hated dragunov and jack. now they are nice to watch

[7:37:49] <@Moobot> https://smash.gg/dhmtl19/events
[7:37:52] <fourohonekay> i have no problem with seeing more bryan. dragunov can be exciting at times also
[7:38:01] <noyd_bird> Sick combo
[7:38:10] <+big4lil> so can jack, and geese
[7:38:18] <terrywolf1> I only know that they nerfed Geese @thehighdrated1
[7:38:25] <+big4lil> people dont dislike the character, they dislike anything they see too often
[7:38:28] <+southofhades> drag was always fun to watch, people just don't like matches that aren't flashy launch fests for whatever reason
[7:38:28] <fourohonekay> geese got axed lol
[7:38:29] <NG_Obscure> lil capped is a top brawlhalla player
[7:38:30] <mynameisflorida> I'm very new to this game. will there be any Lucky Chloe players? she's the one I've been practicing with.

[7:39:15] <+Godfist314> geese is fiyaa
[7:39:15] <srkmechanica> @martialspirit1 they’re not safe per se but the punish can different based on if she teleports or not so it creates a mixup
[7:39:16] <armanlex> @mynameisflorida maybe, but she's not popular in tournaments so don't hold your breath
[7:39:18] <+Aeryn0> Spoodler PogChamp
[7:39:18] <+Silvaaasuitcase> @mynameisflorida Probably not, shes rare to see in tournaments
[7:39:24] <+Fatty_At_Large> SPOODLER
[7:39:25] <mynameisflorida> @noyd_bird ah ok I take that as her not being considered high tier
[7:39:33] <+southofhades> @mynameisflorida don't worry too much about what character you play, you can win with anyone.
[7:39:33] <fourohonekay> excited for my man feng also
[7:39:39] <Cosmicspiral> not high-tier at all
[7:39:54] <matt_420> @mynameisflorida basically yea she's not high tier but she's good for beginners to learn with tho
[7:39:59] <Cosmicspiral> amazing damage though
[7:40:00] <+clydephalinx> Master Raven got BUFFED. Let's celebrate boys
[7:40:12] <mynameisflorida> @southofhades oh for sure I never worry about metal's or tiers when picking characters in game. I was just hoping to see some Chloe gameplay
[7:40:15] <EnochFs> Big spood
[7:40:20] <+martialspirit1> @srkmechanica i see. its weird i played maven a while ago and she whiffed like crazy. but when i wanted to punish she just did the teleport
[7:40:28] <+jbat2039> Ya’ll say not high tier; i hear “not represented much”
[7:40:33] <+Godfist314> yolo rage art?

[7:41:20] <Cosmicspiral> @jbat2039 difference in Tekken is tiers are very compressed, even low-tier characters like the bears can win against most matchups
