[1:48:59] <+Troispoint> it still would be in Capcom's best interest to promote the competitive scene even if they're not directly involved. They lack vision.
[1:49:23] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> capcom only cares about CPT
[1:49:27] <imFebruary> @Troispoint it's astounding - they published amazing titles this year, like DMC and Monster Hunter, but they keep on messing up Street Fighter...

[2:01:13] <randommbn> sajamBanana TriHard
[2:01:21] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> I heard there's french people in that city WutFace
[2:01:23] <apex43> who's who I don't watch sfv
[2:01:25] <MUTILUX> He just wants to jump fireball and ungamash
[2:01:39] <mynameisflorida> is Menat good for a begginer to learn?
[2:01:41] <FinnMcCoolio> is this grand final?
[2:01:43] <+jeremyonf1re> @Say_No_to_Weebs_ and?
[2:01:51] <MUTILUX> Menat is a Guilty Gear character
[2:01:52] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> French and Americans don't mix dawg
[2:01:55] <+jolezef> @FinnMcCoolio : yes
[2:01:58] <ExcellentYong> is this the legendary big booty flux ? PogChamp
[2:01:58] <Angelic_i> who's that on tthe right? PogChamp PogChamp Kreygasm
[2:02:04] <+GUN_Vanguard> Would have been sick if he would have caught her V-Reversal with Demon
[2:02:06] <The_ApolloGreed> @mynameisflorida No shes pretty difficult but shes worth learning if youre into zoning
[2:02:17] <randommbn> ANELE
[2:02:18] <+jolezef> @Say_No_to_Weebs_ confirmed trump voter
[2:02:20] <MUTILUX> When in doubt, pick a top tier
[2:02:29] <mynameisflorida> I've never played Gulty Gear but I do want to try it
[2:02:32] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> again in 2020 too
[2:02:33] <ItisMatthias> interesting a rashid/akuma main
[2:02:35] <MUTILUX> This Rashid is gonna win
[2:02:38] <+jeremyonf1re> @Say_No_to_Weebs_ yes, start to change your mind bro..
[2:02:47] <Krimhera> @say_no_to_weebs_ you a weeb get out of here
[2:02:50] <The_ApolloGreed> @MUTILUX he was already playing a top tier, Kappa
[2:02:56] <randommbn> Trump in 2019 LUL
[2:03:01] <MUTILUX> But now he's playing top 2
[2:03:06] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> french have bad attitudes
[2:03:22] <Da_Nostromo> wut
[2:03:32] <randommbn> Buying Greenland and nuking hurricanes LUL
[2:03:34] <Krimhera> youre an ignorant then
[2:03:36] <+jeremyonf1re> @Say_No_to_Weebs_ PEOPLE have bad attitude...
[2:03:37] <The_ApolloGreed> @MUTILUX I mean Akuma definitely Top 2 only really Rashid is better lol
[2:03:40] <MUTILUX> "Good awareness by FluxWaves" atpCap
[2:04:01] <MUTILUX> Akuma is #3 for sure, Karin is 2
[2:04:13] <A4Dubya> BIRDIE NUMBA ONE
[2:04:24] <randommbn> Ryu top tier
[2:04:28] <+michingmallecho> Rashid too fast. Ken too fast
[2:04:39] <The_ApolloGreed> @MUTILUX nah Karin is 3 not by much but shes definitely 3, Akuma got way to much speed and options
[2:04:41] <apex43> you must have dealt with someone with a bad attitude but regardless where you come from there's bound to be someone with a bad temper or someone just having day
[2:04:44] <MUTILUX> Ryu is P tier, they did him dirty
[2:04:58] <+GUN_Vanguard> I would actually put Akuma above Karin and Rashid, only because I think he's easier to use all around
[2:05:03] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> whens Honda
[2:05:09] <MUTILUX> You don't need options when no one can beat your normals
[2:05:23] <Mrfr1day> Seriously why play any other shoto? Akuma is so much better than ryu sak ken
[2:05:23] <@Moobot> Missed the games? https://youtube.com/dreamhackfg
[2:05:25] <The_ApolloGreed> @GUN_Vanguard idk if hes easier than Rashid
[2:05:36] <The_ApolloGreed> @MUTILUX I mean Akumas normals are OD too tho lol
[2:05:42] <YoungBootsyVK> flux is in that ass
[2:06:09] <+GUN_Vanguard> I think there's a bit more skill involved with playing Rashid than Akuma, but I'm a scrub who plays Balrog, so what do I know LUL
[2:06:22] <MUTILUX> You play Ken when you play on wifi and just want some free points
[2:06:26] <Leo465> when is tekken?
[2:06:36] <MUTILUX> Otherwise Ryu and Sakura are worthless
[2:06:37] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> akuma takes more effort than rashido and mika
[2:06:38] <Indexck> bffRog
[2:06:39] <A4Dubya> all the good players were at PPL it seems like LUL
[2:07:02] <MUTILUX> A CPT event? You don't say
[2:07:17] <+jolezef> ^
[2:07:26] <+GUN_Vanguard> A4Dubya From what I saw, PPL was almost exclusively people from Asia
[2:07:31] <thekarlouchh> Gg's
[2:07:36] <apex43> he kinda cheeks I'm ngl
[2:07:39] <+jolezef> this 1st money barely covers a japanese player's flight
[2:07:46] <+jolezef> +tourney
[2:07:47] <+GUN_Vanguard> And yeah, it's a CPT event, so naturally there would be more people there
[2:07:49] <RisingPheonix45> sometimes it's nice to hace an event that isn't all showstoppers
[2:07:55] <whitemambaeli> when this shitty game ends again?
[2:08:02] <MUTILUX> Everyone here is kinda butt
[2:08:13] <+blinded_justice037> Did PK Subban get traded to MTL then enter Dreamhack?
[2:08:13] <zeuspk7> Tekken next
[2:08:18] <The_ApolloGreed> @GUN_Vanguard tbh I think Akuma is easier online and his base kit is more simple, but I think Akuma being actually paper strength durability wise makes him hard, especially with Karin,Bison and Birdie being in top 5 characters lol
[2:08:18] <zeuspk7> Hopefully
[2:08:19] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> this a local
[2:08:21] <whitemambaeli> Tekken Kreygasm
[2:08:31] <thekarlouchh> MUTILUX: LUL
[2:08:53] <MUTILUX> Akuma got small girl health, it's like 900 or something rn
[2:08:59] <zeuspk7> Shit if it's a reset it's gonna take time
[2:09:00] <+jeremyonf1re> is tekken the FG where you hit people when is still on the ground?
[2:09:03] <Mrfr1day> LTG could have taken it
[2:09:04] <apex43> cheeks
[2:09:11] <ElChakotay > flux going in
[2:09:18] <YoungBootsyVK> rami is rusty he has 3 games to remember how to play sfv
[2:09:21] <apex43> this man a bonafide scrub
[2:09:23] <+Makopusher> yep
[2:09:32] <CLouDStriFev1> this is how u play too @ElChakotay
[2:09:38] <flashyplaya> Does the health really make a difference? Like whats the Health points for the heaviest characters
[2:09:40] <The_ApolloGreed> @Mrfr1day nah LTG is beyond Cheeks Flux is actually not bad
[2:09:49] <+DelzonFires> Rami not throwing FB's
[2:09:50] <A4Dubya> @ElChakotay take some notes on this Mika Kappa
[2:09:57] <thekarlouchh> Free mcd's
[2:09:58] <MUTILUX> Health/Stun hella makes a difference
[2:09:59] <The_ApolloGreed> @flashyplaya Akuma has 100 less health than Abigail and G
[2:10:01] <maoiii> flux going for the kill.
[2:10:06] <CLouDStriFev1> i dont think Akuma is the answer
[2:10:12] <ShadowAceSRK> !bracket
[2:10:12] <@Moobot> https://smash.gg/dhmtl19/events
[2:10:22] <The_ApolloGreed> @flashyplaya Basically depending on the character akuma has two combos before he dies
[2:10:26] <@Moobot> Follow all the action on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dreamhackfg
[2:10:31] <jomon487> Imstilldadaddy mate got this free Poooound Poooound Poooound
[2:10:39] <MUTILUX> ^ You get one less guess
[2:10:51] <apex43> this is sodomy
[2:11:26] <CLouDStriFev1> stop using Akuma bro
[2:11:36] <flashyplaya> @The_ApolloGreed So is that like two jabs worth of damage?
[2:11:39] <+blinded_justice037> Subban looks pissed
[2:11:41] <ShadowAceSRK> flux is going in
[2:11:49] <YoungBootsyVK> flux is in that ass. he's doing alot of matchup specific tech
[2:11:50] <apex43> it's not akuma he just getting outplayed
[2:11:51] <+Superpattz81> Still gonna have to guess regardless
[2:11:58] <A4Dubya> mauled
[2:12:00] <brandonquebec> rami needs to wsitch to his rashid
[2:12:01] <apex43> don't matter the character
[2:12:08] <wolfgangfinito> sup yall
[2:12:14] <The_ApolloGreed> @flashyplaya pretty much basically Akuma has such little health a Jab does like 10% more to him than anyone else
[2:12:18] <CLouDStriFev1> yea Rashid was better than this
[2:12:19] <ShadowAceSRK> stop the match
[2:12:20] <apex43> What's good
[2:12:25] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> akuma health really 900 this season?

[2:14:11] <zeuspk7> Wrecked
[2:14:13] <apex43> ain't no way
[2:14:13] <The_ApolloGreed> @flashyplaya I play Cody, it takes 3 Big combos to stun/kill abi it takes 1 and a half to kill akuma let tthat shit sink in
[2:14:20] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> @flashyplaya u stupid tho, tokido won because of a 25 hp buff
[2:14:21] <A4Dubya> that was not pretty
[2:14:30] <Say_No_to_Weebs_> won Evo
[2:14:34] <CLouDStriFev1> flux is always this aggressive tho
