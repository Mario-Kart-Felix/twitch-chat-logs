[0:00:06] <+r4ampage1> @albedo58 what are you talking about Betadood makes it top 8 all the time even with JP players, it's surprising he isn't top8
[0:00:16] <~ArcSystemWorksU> turn your TVs back on, stream should be back
[0:00:20] <ImmaAmpelus> Betadood won CEO

[0:00:30] <+Aoko_Aozaki> hell yeah
[0:00:30] <Sigas> Stream is back
[0:00:36] <boostingwarlord> can we get science fiction ost instead

[0:00:48] <TheOnlineArcade> yup its back
[0:00:50] <albedo58> The BBCF tournaments in US only have like one or two JP players usually, if at all.
[0:00:52] <schwis_orifice> @ArcSystemWorksU hey will you stream loser bracket matches this time? yesterday was garbage :)
[0:00:59] <+Kuribohdudalala> Were beta dood or elyon close to making top 8?? Missed the stream, was at a yugioh regionals yesterday
[0:01:02] <JustDylanK> this is a tournament with almost all the top japanese arcade players with plenty of names nobody has seen before, its not surprising at all betadood didnt get top 8
[0:01:10] <+gutcruncher> Sol is weirdly buff and manly next to those three Anime Ladies
[0:01:23] <Tacestultus> ragna best girl
[0:01:32] <boostingwarlord> Sol is a really thicc girl
[0:01:40] <+Kuribohdudalala> @tacestultus ragna best waifu
[0:01:45] <darkcuack> 3 legged girl ftw
[0:01:51] <ImmaAmpelus> Can't wait to watch my boi Souji make it to finals just to get murdered by Fen like he always does
[0:01:52] <Ninzard> Sol has biceps the size of Noel's waist
[0:01:53] <albedo58> It bothers me how some people think everything revolves around the US tournaments. If they don't see a player in US tourney, it's like they don't exist
[0:01:55] <NoirNephilim10> Noel and her 3 red bitches
[0:01:58] <Fadedsun> Which top 8 is coming up?
[0:02:07] <+ThatGuyGandhi> I hope someone throws a phone again

[0:02:46] <Fadedsun> GG after BB?
[0:02:53] <schwis_orifice> yutta wont make it

[0:02:59] <ImmaAmpelus> says you
[0:03:08] <+Kuribohdudalala> BB-GG-BBTAG for anyone wondering
[0:03:13] <+hoggo_chan> ah ok
[0:03:16] <albedo58> Maybe they are saving for a GG announcement
[0:03:25] <ImmaAmpelus> Yuta is EVO CF champ, baby, he astral'd the God of BB
[0:03:28] <+Kuribohdudalala> Really???
[0:03:35] <Tougou> GG is last
[0:03:35] <Altria_Pendrago> according to the schedule: CF > TAG > GG
[0:03:39] <aronruiz08> I though it was BB-Tag-GG
[0:03:41] <NoirNephilim10> maybe an announcement after CF?
[0:03:53] <+Cynacious> Is there a schedule anywherE?

[0:04:46] <MjrStrickland> @Herzenswarme inb4 they also ruin BB
[0:04:50] <mikotokurogane> Naoto is in top 8 right?
[0:04:58] <Baiken__> @Herzenswarme lol they will ruin BB too
[0:05:02] <aronruiz08> @JaegerEXP It was Condemnation wings II, Tsubaki theme
[0:05:04] <albedo58> Naoto in winners

[0:05:41] <Herzenswarme> @MjrStrickland All that matters to me are the character mechanics. The 15 second combos can disappear for all I know. So I have faith.
[0:05:56] <whoisant_> Don't get your hopes up, if there isn't an announcement. Let's still sink in that we got footage of the new game atm.
[0:05:56] <schwis_orifice> BBCF will forever remain incomplete because ryusei left like a bitch

[0:06:36] <schwis_orifice> @Herzenswarme thing is that just because you keep getting beat the fuck up, you shouldnt wish the game to cater to you
[0:06:51] <mikotokurogane> @ChapaMcCree i like having decent online
[0:06:52] <RyuGoomba> wow cf continues to be a bad game with no hakumen

[0:08:01] <Herzenswarme> @schwis_orifice My point is that if they were to be removed I would not care, so the chances that they ruin a new BB for me are lower. I'm not saying that they should.

[0:09:41] <+Wave_Kusanagi> This song IS Continuum Shift to me. I remember back when Kaqn and Zakiyama used to go at it like mad dogs. <3
[0:09:52] <Powa315> yah, just leave games in the good state they're eventually in, don't butcher them cause then no one wins, learning fighting games is how they work, just make tutorials or something

[0:10:05] <Jase135YT> Fuck Nightmare Fiction gets me off.
[0:10:08] <schwis_orifice> for instance i dont care for setplay because i dont use setplay characters but im concerned if they remove it, because there are players out there that lean towards that playstyle.
[0:10:27] <Powa315> Or even high execution characters
[0:10:28] <TehStigma> CS was peak arcsys story
[0:10:29] <schwis_orifice> everyone should be taken into account.

[0:11:40] <muctarr22> @Powa315 like hte art style
[0:11:43] <Herzenswarme> @schwis_orifice Yes they should, but in this scenario we were already assuming that would not be the case. And in that scenario I had higher chances to be safe for at least a single iteration.
[0:11:47] <TheHeraldOfMoe> KappaPride
[0:11:47] <MjrStrickland> i honestly dont care much about them making accessible games as long as they leave our existing franchises alone

[0:12:08] <Trarnarok> everyone does :(

[0:12:42] <G_Zus_> bb vs gg
[0:12:43] <Powa315> I don't really like the art style for it but it's mainly the simplification, I can't stand it, I mean +R has a good amount of a learning curve and things to learn, but xrd just feels like a pretty simple game to me in comparison, idk if it's just me

[0:13:18] <muctarr22> yall want that complex shit but at the end of the day high level players gonna make shit high level
[0:13:19] <Nund0> Xrd was definitely simplified from +R but it was still fairly complex
[0:13:20] <+Mr_NevNev> give bb GG 2020 graphics
[0:13:21] <DrDigglerPhD> they keep thinking that simplify fgs are the way...but the issue is and always been content, netcode, listening the community

[0:13:52] <Boldnbrash> I’m curious. Do you all prefer BB to maintain its sprite tradition or go 2.5D like xrd
[0:13:52] <+AmoebaUK> Imagine Mu turrets in a tag game monkaS
[0:13:54] <nycklex> it will

[0:14:27] <Trarnarok> this is mus theme so..

[0:15:09] <DrDigglerPhD> @MegaMeister that would be legit...didnt they already have interest in making a game like that?
[0:15:10] <datmouse> I'm more into sprites but I'd like some snk tier 2d animation Kreygasm

[0:15:22] <x3nop> GG went 3D because of BB so I'd rather BB stayed how it is now
[0:15:22] <pplcallmesinbad> all they need to do for BB is to redesign Makoto's outfit. Shit's ugly

[0:15:31] <Zyrox3> 2.5D is the way to go. The sprites are pretty dated nowadays bc they don't scale
[0:15:33] <火災の炎> @Trarnarok extensions like FFZ
[0:15:35] <+HydroSting> I never played +R but you also have to remember that game is old as fuck it practically doesn’t belong in this day and age
[0:15:39] <ImmaAmpelus> @pplcallmesinbad BRO SAME FUCK makoto's outfit
[0:15:45] <ragnanivank18> @datmouse That would be pretty expensive supposedly. apparently KOF13's sprites nearly made SNK go bankrupt
[0:15:49] <x3nop> There aren't enough 2D fighters on the market anymore
[0:15:50] <UnluckySpade7> Give Makoto her Jacket mori
[0:15:52] <+hoggo_chan> im sure they will fix the major problems, you can lower a games skill floor without lowering the skill ceiling, as long as we dont submit feedback like "put it back to normal" then they will listen to us
[0:15:53] <MegaMeister> forget these wack games. whens competitive
[0:15:54] <datmouse> yeah but I can dream FeelsBadMan
[0:15:59] <deevan> also what's this degen slow mode?
[0:16:01] <DownThyme> Put Izanami in tag so she can put ribcage on her partner Kappa
[0:16:02] <Powa315> I mean I think the way the game plays it fine, but maybe it could be slightly streamlined along the cast
[0:16:04] <johnyoly420> Top 8 hasn’t started yet?
[0:16:07] <Trarnarok> sprites are more expensive than 3d models when done properly
[0:16:08] <schwis_orifice> @x3nop and there wont be. making sprites is way more expensive than doing 3D games like gg
[0:16:12] <+Wave_Kusanagi> I like Makoto just the way she is. I wouldn't mind if she kept her cool jacket on, though
[0:16:14] <Snoxo> CF already retired 60% of the cast in some shape or form. Roster cuts are inevitable IMO
[0:16:15] <Nublei> TERUMI IN BBTAG WHEN

[0:16:23] <Bloo561> Top 8 for CF starts in 8 mins
[0:16:35] <+AmoebaUK> CF has the full cast? @Snoxo
[0:16:45] <+gutcruncher> BBTAG never dropped a character tho
[0:16:50] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @AmoebaUK I think he means the end of the story
[0:16:56] <Trarnarok> @AmoebaUK he meant story wise
[0:17:02] <DrDigglerPhD> i feel like BB is gonna be redone....its too hard to keep the balance in that game...and it has so many characters now
[0:17:10] <XBloom_> CF killed all the villains and the protagonist
[0:17:17] <johnyoly420> Carl will definitely be a villain
[0:17:22] <Tacestultus> @Nublei no.
[0:17:22] <kokujin_> cant wait for female ragna
[0:17:23] <+AmoebaUK> Ohh right. Yeah BB reached the end of it's life really. Wouldn't mind a new IP :)))))
[0:17:23] <Trarnarok> ragnas arc is done, ES' arc is next
[0:17:24] <kyo_kanon_ksg> 👀
[0:17:28] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @XBloom_ Well, not ALL of the villains. Relius and Hazama got away
[0:17:28] <DownThyme> I mean, Haz is technically alive
[0:17:30] <ragnanivank18> Ragna is not dead nor non-existent like people say he is
[0:17:31] <datmouse> vagna PogChamp
[0:17:34] <Snoxo> Yeah, i was talking story wise. Jin is a cripple as well.
[0:17:35] <schwis_orifice> rachel new protagonist. we P3 FES in this bitch
[0:17:38] <+HydroSting> Oh you’re right they did kill Ragna hggFeelspiccoloman
[0:17:47] <kyo_kanon_ksg> y el gg ?
[0:17:48] <icirubite> but it also set up Carl as a badguy they're not gonna do a complete reboot
[0:17:48] <didgereedoodah> Jin is fine at the end of CF
[0:17:50] <WKHyo> because of ctb we're gonna be stuck with cf as the last blazblue game.... feelsbadman
[0:17:55] <tusk_act4> Ranga got straight up deleted.
[0:17:58] <Trarnarok> i mean they didnt kill hiom, he just was undone LUL
[0:18:00] <DrDigglerPhD> ragna isnt dead..he took himself out of the timeline
[0:18:01] <+gutcruncher> I think if BB dropped any characters its fanbase would riot. That game gets so many sales not because of the fighting but because of the VN and Waifu-ism. ive literally spoken to people who LOVE blazblue but barely/never fight
[0:18:03] <x3nop> The ending was hinting Rags is alive tho
[0:18:05] <Tacestultus> our boi is dead NotLikeThis
[0:18:07] <johnyoly420> Ragna didn’t get deleted lmao
[0:18:09] <+r4ampage1> Azrael is just on Ice again you could easily Break him out :v
[0:18:09] <XBloom_> I don't want other IP i want my old characters but redesigned
[0:18:12] <SixWingedAngel> naoto's reason of existence is to be the new protagonist in the next bb
[0:18:13] <UnluckySpade7> They'll just make Carl Relius 2.0 no biggie and Hazama is still in bloodedge experience so he could come back
[0:18:16] <OldManDeckardCain> next bb is the crew somehow went into another dimension where combos are illegal Kappa
[0:18:22] <+HydroSting> Ragna died for a good cause tho. Rip the boy hggFeelspiccoloman
[0:18:23] <ragnanivank18> Ragna is just staying with the origin in some separate space. he's not dead or nonexistent
[0:18:24] <x3nop> Either that or Rachel will be running around with Blood Scythe in the next BB
[0:18:30] <+Wave_Kusanagi> There is "a" Ragna somewhere out there. Whether or not it's our Ragna is the question, but Rachel is looking for them.

[0:18:53] <anthraxexe> if a new bb gets made and characters are getting dropped, lamb would probably go too and id be sad ):
[0:18:54] <Onikage234> A new mainline blazblue would be cool but I don’t think it’s gonna happen any time soon sadly
[0:19:03] <+HydroSting> As long as they make bullet an actual character in the next game I don’t care.
[0:19:04] <+VolumedAF> what song is this?
[0:19:05] <Zyrox3> I'd be fine with a completely new protag tbh

[0:19:16] <tusk_act4> After cross tag they’ll make it

[0:19:26] <johnyoly420> This isn’t rebellion lmao
[0:19:26] <aronruiz08> Nah next arc is with Nu. She's the only one without a purpose in her life.
[0:19:27] <Trarnarok> can't wait for xtag to die then
[0:19:30] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @Zyrox3 Oh fuck that. If it ain't Ragna or some other version of him, I don't want it.
[0:19:31] <x3nop> Under Heaven Destruction
[0:19:31] <monochrome_shiro> @volumedaf Under Heaven’s Destruction
[0:19:33] <SixWingedAngel> mori posted an edgied up version of naoto a while ago on his twitter
[0:19:34] <ikidd> bbtag is the new bb
[0:19:35] <Powa315> A really cool new protag would be cool, but if it's another char we know, a cool new mechanic would be cool imo
[0:19:36] <XBloom_> I love ragna way too much smh, I wouldn't like another protag
[0:19:37] <Onikage234> Wait
[0:19:41] <icirubite> @snoxo in the end scene Jin is completely fine and standing
[0:19:42] <수난임> 언제시작함?
[0:19:43] <+VolumedAF> thanks for the response guys volumeBDJ
[0:19:46] <Nublei> Ragna PepeHands
[0:19:49] <johnyoly420> Nu is a vegetable lmao
[0:19:52] <Tacestultus> as long as lambda comes back im happy
[0:19:54] <Trarnarok> @ikidd please stop with the blasphemy :(
[0:19:55] <+HydroSting> Susan getting put in crosstag was the only reason I bought the game lol.
[0:19:58] <schwis_orifice> naoto K new protag
[0:20:00] <x3nop> Most likely Alpha will be the next protag
[0:20:05] <mikotokurogane> Arcsys play spirit of fire next cowards
[0:20:07] <+Mattocat> mattocReally
[0:20:10] <UsernameCrisis> naoto for new protag Kappa
[0:20:13] <aronruiz08> 5 minutes PogChamp
[0:20:16] <kyo_kanon_ksg> AsianGlow
[0:20:18] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Naoto has his own series to worry about. LUL
[0:20:19] <UnluckySpade7> Alike! it's all like a spiral!
[0:20:19] <Powa315> @HydroSting Same lmfao, but adachi made it even better
[0:20:21] <anthraxexe> I think a tsubakumen with a design centering around having both the Susanoo unit AND the izayoi would be cool af
[0:20:24] <x3nop> The game is downright stating it's her time to shine next
[0:20:28] <dinHeld> A new bb won't come for a while. Which means it's likely to have rollback though.
[0:20:29] <killacam0824> 5min AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH SwiftRage PogChamp SwiftRage PogChamp SwiftRage PogChamp SwiftRage PogChamp SwiftRage PogChamp
[0:20:30] <XBloom_> BTW Nu lambda and Noel are nuns now i dont think they be do anuy fighting anytime soon
[0:20:31] <+Mattocat> Jubei is the new protag mattocJubeited
[0:20:34] <+gutcruncher> Arcsys have LabZero do the visuals of the next BB you cowards!
[0:20:35] <lori_993> are people actually expecting mainline news
[0:20:36] <ikidd> @Trarnarok bbtag sold hotcakes vs normal bb. They aren't going back
[0:20:41] <Snoxo> Crippled as in "Never be able to fight again". I definitely remember either Trinity or someone else mentioning that in the story.
[0:20:46] <Jyuuken67> next main character will be adult carl
[0:20:48] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @lori_993 Nah
[0:20:53] <+HydroSting> MAKE TORAKAKA PLAYABLE AND BUFF BULLET THAGS ALL I WANT hggGuapo hggGuapo hggGuapo hggGuapo
[0:20:55] <Zyrox3> well I'd be fine with a new protag except for NaotoK. Dude's boring af
[0:20:58] <schwis_orifice> @XBloom_ watch someone mention ragna and her whole act crumbles down instantly LUL
[0:21:03] <lori_993> i would hope jubei is a lock for the next entry but he's probably gonna be written out as too old lmao
[0:21:04] <johnyoly420> Carl will be a villain, not MC
[0:21:05] <mikotokurogane> @Zyrox3 L
[0:21:06] <tusk_act4> Adult Carl is 100% a villain
[0:21:14] <Onikage234> Bruh I hope they announce CFEX or a new mainline blazblue
[0:21:19] <buggsnlola> Kagura next protag PogChamp
[0:21:21] <whoisant_> Taokaka is playable, she's already unlocked Kappa
[0:21:22] <anthraxexe> next iteration of carl will have both nirvana and minerva
[0:21:23] <vanico> it's crazy how civil and constructive this chat is compared to SF or Tekken streams :D
[0:21:25] <lori_993> adult carl is relius clover
[0:21:25] <ikidd> bbtag is the new mainline
[0:21:26] <Rychtor> BlazBlue kind of reminds me of Naruto in the sense that its an anime, but with a different story.
[0:21:26] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Carl is probably going to be a horrifying villain
[0:21:28] <MjrStrickland> @Zyrox3 **microdashes next to you** wot did ya say m8?
[0:21:29] <Jyuuken67> he'd be a hero lol he'd turn ppl into puppets
[0:21:29] <x3nop> Linhua next protag
[0:21:32] <UnluckySpade7> Trinity and Kajun for CF extend
[0:21:35] <XBloom_> @schwis_orifice That shouldn't happen cuz ragna erased himself from existence
[0:21:37] <Slaythe> ikidd that's because they released 50 iterations of BB. If they move BB to the Xrd engine and update it with DLC instead of full price version people would buy it.
[0:21:39] <ChemicalChocobo> which theme is this
[0:21:46] <Tacestultus> lambda was literally dead and they casually brought her back for the new games they can just bs a reason for nu to fight
[0:21:51] <crazyape6554__> @ikidd Mori said bbtag is not cannon so it’s not mainline
[0:21:53] <mikotokurogane> Only if we got cfex
[0:21:55] <x3nop> Under Heaven Destuction @ChemicalChocobo
[0:21:55] <Powa315> Idk the story rlly but if the susanoo unit's still around, someone new in it would be cool ig
[0:21:55] <tusk_act4> Under Heaven Destruction
[0:21:55] <Blackcobra14> I'd be down with Naoto as the protag tbh
[0:21:55] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @ChemicalChocobo Under Heaven Destruction. Ragna vs. Jin
[0:21:57] <+HydroSting> Carl is so boring. He’s just criminally insane
[0:22:03] <ikidd> new BB is going to get the new GG2020 treatment
[0:22:09] <schwis_orifice> @XBloom_ u dont think at least some fragment of his memory remains on that crazy bitch?
[0:22:10] <lori_993> would honestly kill for CF extend but i can't expect anything from this lmao
[0:22:14] <DownThyme> People really forgetting that Mori wanted bbtag to be a spinoff and keep it that way?
[0:22:18] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @Blackcobra14 Again, not happening. He's the protag of his own spinoff already. Do people not know this or something?
[0:22:22] <Krackatoa> IT'S HABBENING
[0:22:27] <Powa315> Yo queen of rose time
[0:22:28] <+RoyalSunset> yo see me in Blazblue CS Extend
[0:22:29] <tusk_act4> The Susanoo unit is deep in the boundary now
[0:22:32] <+gutcruncher> Arcsys should really just make a sequel to the superfamicom Sailor Moon S. Make it roughly as broken but with more stuff and make it look awesome. ill pay all the money
[0:22:32] <Chasem121> all i want is for CF to get the dub
[0:22:33] <+Aerodat> daily reminder if you want ragna to come back as a robot waifu you're a fucking cop
[0:22:37] <+MasamuneNinjo> love this theme
[0:22:40] <dinHeld> new bb will remove drive button. Too hard for new players Kappa
[0:22:40] <Tacestultus> cf extend with nine nerfs PogChamp
[0:22:42] <UnluckySpade7> I heard mori still wants to update CF but arcsys won't let him
[0:22:46] <anthraxexe> ragna should come back as a robot waifu
[0:22:47] <youbutfromthepast> who's theme is this?
[0:22:47] <sonic2cool> Wait BBTAG is canon?
[0:22:52] <whoisant_> Rachel's theme
[0:22:53] <tusk_act4> Rachel
[0:22:53] <+Juunee> put alpha - 01 in bbtag
[0:22:55] <Nublei> CBT VAMPIRE Kreygasm
[0:22:56] <+HydroSting> Cfex with nine taken out of the game poggers
[0:22:57] <cpuvioletheart> queen of roses 1 is better
[0:22:58] <+TheRealRedHavoc> CF extend with rollback netcode please
[0:22:58] <XBloom_> @schwis_orifice nah cuz taht means Nu would have it too, and the first thing she gonna try to do is trying to form the black beast
[0:22:59] <Zyrox3> BBTAG aint canon
[0:22:59] <schwis_orifice> queen of rose 2 sucks
[0:23:05] <Oqueo34> queen of rose 2
[0:23:07] <+XxGintoki_xX> cf extend but delete suzan and izanami 🤔
[0:23:08] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @Aerodat If I want Ragna to come back as Alpha-01, then I arrest people for a living to keep the peace? Huh? zoneThink
[0:23:09] <crazyape6554__> No bbtag is not cannon
[0:23:10] <Krackatoa> ARE YOU READY BLAZBUDS?
[0:23:11] <squidwardtennisballs__> anyone know who put fenritti in losers for bbtag?
[0:23:12] <Powa315> @Nublei I'm dying
[0:23:16] <DownThyme> BBTAG is a SPINOFF
[0:23:22] <anthraxexe> delete everyone but nami
[0:23:32] <CrimsonBrave> @squidwardtennisballs__ kyamei i believe
[0:23:36] <+DarkGravityFlames> 🛏️🚶♂️
[0:23:40] <crazyape6554__> @squidwardtennisballs__ Kyamei
[0:23:40] <schwis_orifice> bbtag is canon but its a different timeline so technically it doesnt even matter Kappa
[0:23:44] <+HydroSting> Delete everyone but bullet and buff her Pepega
[0:23:45] <ragnanivank18> Yo DGF
[0:23:48] <Gun_Flame> OG Queen of Rose is miles better than 2, fight me.
[0:23:48] <squidwardtennisballs__> ah gotcha thanks
[0:23:51] <lori_993> i'm honestly just expecting tag to be the future for BB until they do whatever they're doing with dark war
[0:23:52] <x3nop> Everything in BB is canon sooo
[0:23:57] <+Nintentrix> moon2SH
[0:23:58] <killacam0824> 10 secs left I'm gonna
[0:24:00] <tusk_act4> I am really glad that Izanami is dead, because that means she won’t be in the next BB game
[0:24:00] <DownThyme> Make ribcage cover the entire screen Kappa
[0:24:00] <Powa315> Maybe we outta talk about what new weapons we'd want in a new bb
[0:24:02] <cloudskyblue> a mainline bb sequel wont happen until bbtag has every single anime fg character
[0:24:02] <+Wave_Kusanagi> BBTAG is merely anothe rpossibility of the Continuum Shift. Kappa
[0:24:06] <mikotokurogane> 50 seconds
[0:24:08] <cpuvioletheart> no of course bbtag is canon thats why is has unist p4a rwby blitzkamf and heaet aino
[0:24:09] <Zyrox3> OG QoR is definitely better
[0:24:10] <+albertshawn5> 50
[0:24:10] <Onikage234> @aerodat bruh
[0:24:11] <UnluckySpade7> All persona spinoffs are canon so...…..
[0:24:15] <+HydroSting> Izanami was a mistake
[0:24:15] <anthraxexe> dying has never kept characters from coming back lol
[0:24:17] <LordGreenwoods> will never understand why there is no GG in BBTAG

[0:45:17] <+lolPfhor> the "downside" of ribcage isn't really much of a big deal when you consider this character normally can't block when she has the bits anyway
[0:45:23] <+lolPfhor> so she doesn't block
[0:45:24] <anthraxexe> nine isnt cancer unless you play someone like makoto or tager

[1:57:33] <Showbiz54> lmao ribcage again
[1:57:34] <Zyrox3> ngl Izanami's pretty sick. Truly feels like a boss character
[1:57:35] <MR_Rhymes> izanami is black KevinTurtle
[1:57:37] <%Bucksamazing> izanami is balance
[1:57:38] <schwis_orifice> izanami is honest, izanami is footsies
[1:57:40] <prismsombre> Says who?
[1:57:44] <torrenz420> i dont know whats going on
[1:57:50] <mikotokurogane> Ribcage makes me sad
[1:57:58] <datmouse> I need more flat AND fat bitches in my games
[1:57:59] <gordieda20> Izanami Pressure
[1:58:03] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> ya'll can shit on izanami balance, but you gotta admit, she is a cool as heck character
[1:58:04] <%Bucksamazing> izanami pays my bills
[1:58:11] <Not_Dragonspenc> What’s insane about rib cage?
[1:58:11] <Showbiz54> run away rachel!
[1:58:15] <prismsombre> Nah stan Izanami
[1:58:19] <notredblade35> whens fenrich
[1:58:24] <UnluckySpade7> kinda wish she was more stacked tbh
[1:58:25] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> @Not_Dragonspenc it's auto guard
[1:58:28] <5catz> tomorrow
[1:58:30] <datmouse> @Not_Dragonspenc just armor through shit
[1:58:32] <%Bucksamazing> rib cage is fair..stop pressing buttons
[1:58:33] <Not_Dragonspenc> Ah that’s good
[1:58:34] <DryGuy84> Izanami is cool, but frustrating to deal with
[1:58:35] <mikotokurogane> CF kinda getting poverty doe
[1:58:35] <Tacestultus> @Not_Dragonspenc it gives her invul and immune to flinch
[1:58:36] <makomako00> すごすぎやろこのイザナミｗｗｗｗ
[1:58:51] <mikotokurogane> makes me sad i didn't find out about this game earlier than i did
[1:58:51] <Dyson_Bladeless> shes not invul
[1:58:52] <MayorofMoronMountain> it's called hitstun
[1:58:53] <Zyrox3> when's ZA WARUDO super?
[1:58:53] <FelGrandTV> Izanami Want Ragna
[1:58:53] <+commiku1> just block the 16 way mixup and ribcage is balanced
[1:58:56] <Dyson_Bladeless> shes just got GPs on everything
[1:58:58] <Showbiz54> just backdash bro
[1:59:02] <JackOforGG2020> flat always win sajam200
[1:59:04] <prismsombre> just block bro
[1:59:06] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> it's auto guard but depletes barrier gauge really fast, so it can be risky if you dont know how to manage it
[1:59:08] <Doctorsixer> When has CF not been poverty?
[1:59:10] <mtlwolf_> just 4Head
[1:59:14] <mikotokurogane> The wind LMAO
[1:59:15] <%Bucksamazing> cf ain't poverty...arcsys just treating it like a ex girlfriend
[1:59:16] <schwis_orifice> flat ninjas wru at

[1:59:28] <Nublei> NotLikeThis
[1:59:30] <dumblibrary> izanami currently dispensing the mids
[1:59:39] <+gutcruncher> i want slow mo footage of all of rachels animations. i can never get enough of how its her minions taking all the hits while she just goes "meh"
[1:59:42] <beerserker_> ymst looks hella strong atpQuan
[1:59:45] <%Bucksamazing> imagine not blocking mids
[1:59:46] <notredblade35> izanami does not dispense mids
[1:59:50] <mikotokurogane> I really had unist shill mentality but cf without a doubt is top 1 in my fg list
[1:59:51] <notredblade35> she dispenses highs and lows
[1:59:54] <notredblade35> and command grabs
[1:59:56] <Tacestultus> izanami has mad mixups
[2:00:02] <shadyblackg> Izanami for bbtag man
[2:00:11] <mikotokurogane> @notredblade35 W
[2:00:11] <Appleman3310> did bbtag top 8 already happen?
[2:00:15] <novahyou> Izanami breaks the game apparently
[2:00:15] <Xzalldon> no

[2:00:21] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Go Naoto. All or nothing
[2:00:22] <%Bucksamazing> red blade should be a tsubaki main
[2:00:22] <MayorofMoronMountain> no one is doing the cool super BibleThump
[2:00:22] <shadowswordsman2471> yikes
[2:00:22] <notredblade35> jin is the honest mid dispenser which is why i hope fenrich wins
[2:00:22] <pow2009> ResidentSleeper The ribcage goes up and the hype goes down
[2:00:23] <aronruiz08> I see the pattern. Go away, put rib cage, and go ungainly bunga.
[2:00:24] <Numakie> izanami is a fiar character
[2:00:26] <+gutcruncher> bbtag has not happened yet, nor has guilty
[2:00:26] <phychosp42> play NAOTO
[2:00:27] <cpuvioletheart> bbtag is after cf
[2:00:29] <prismsombre> Izanami wins as best girl again

[2:40:54] <Raf1557> doubt
[2:41:03] <spinal329> Nah
[2:41:08] <Trarnarok> jin isnt top tier, you can tell since fenritti is the only jin here
[2:41:17] <jano_darkk> DansGame
[2:41:24] <Helel2o3> Fenrich inherited the legacy of pink Jin from Tetsuwo. Kreygasm
[2:41:24] <datmouse> no cf extend FeelsBadMan
[2:41:24] <novahyou> Jin is great but in comparison to many characters he actually seems fair and balanced
[2:41:24] <Brudergas> Jin is Top 5 wtf
[2:41:26] <%Bucksamazing> doubting fenrich is the worst thing u can do
[2:41:32] <laserdude17> didn't people used to think izanami wasn't that good
[2:41:33] <AcoSrbin> makoto is the only top tier
[2:41:36] <AscendedDonut> longest top 8 ever ResidentSleeper
[2:41:37] <notblob> jin is honest
[2:41:38] <TheSnake_> new gg2020 trailer after that. bs blazing baybee
[2:41:39] <gabp11> how about izanami? is she really top 1 just like the commentators say?
[2:41:47] <Lugoitis> They should announce a dub so I can get this game🙏
[2:41:47] <TheHeartsSweet> buff es
[2:41:49] <Xzalldon> the only one who appear twice technically is Izanami
[2:41:51] <DryGuy84> Izanami is honest Kappa

[2:41:53] <Skargust> lmao
[2:41:53] <sidexblaze> @gabp11 she's top 3
[2:41:53] <quang0d> Es is @gabp11
[2:41:53] <grimu_reeppah> beig the only representative of a character =/= the character not being good
[2:41:55] <novahyou> also, there are many ppl that use let's say, Es like an S tier, but I've only seen Fenrich use Jin like that
[2:41:59] <+Niwona> BB has some of the coolest character gameplay designs in all fighters but then they have some of the dumbest ever
[2:41:59] <Trarnarok> @jarron42 whats the discord?
[2:42:01] <quang0d> Izanami is top 3

[2:56:43] <UnluckySpade7> Ribcage takes up barrier and if barrier gets used up you take more damage

[2:56:46] <+Lennox517> i was like why she always in danger
[2:56:47] <Trarnarok> @MarquisDeS the usage of ribcage drains the barrier meter, which then takes you to danger state and makes you take more dmg
[2:56:50] <Sheraldford> @MarquisDeS ribcage drains barrier, once you run out you are in danger
[2:56:53] <xcryptlordx> its cause hes in danger

[4:19:11] <DryGuy84> @gutcruncher ok, boomer
[4:19:12] <+gutcruncher> while also giving more companies and excuse to sponsor events. like RAM makers or thermaltake or something
[4:19:13] <rrobrob> you gonna buy 4 PC’s for setups? @gutcruncher
[4:19:14] <ScrappySensei> dude got iced into a quick 3-0
[4:19:15] <BobTheSheriff> PC should absolutely be the standard but japan market controls anime games and japanese players only play ps4 and arcade

[4:19:23] <Ezeto> bo5 BBTAG are done in like 3 minutes monkaS
[4:19:28] <+gutcruncher> ill bring some PCs for setups, yes
[4:19:31] <thk573> @gutcruncher The problem is that often enough, PC ports are unoptimized compared to the PS4 version. PS4 is also cheaper to buy in bulk than it is for PCs

[4:19:44] <+commiku1> @gutcruncher i completely agree but good pcs that are portable and can run the game consistently are expensive
[4:19:46] <JackOforGG2020> im glad bbtag is easy America can finally win sajamSegue4
[4:19:47] <spinal329> Pcs are more expensive and will take more space in the venues

[6:51:11] <SolxBaiken> Not true... Dr. Baldhead won't be in new GG #kappa
[6:51:14] <Mimeblade> @MightyZek based on recent feedback, this game feels like GG mostly, just more emphasis on corner combos and Damage is too high with moves missing.

[6:57:08] <novahyou> @musashi8790 yeah I know, but your idea is an interesting way to expanding the roster in a way that feels natural
[6:57:22] <novahyou> though there's nothing natural about Ky's offspring coming out of EGGS
[6:57:25] <CorrodedS> this remix ruined my favorite part FeelsBadMan
[6:57:41] <+TIPME> play the korean OSTs

[7:00:33] <1shoryuken> they shouldn't of revealed his face
[7:00:36] <musashi8790> I hope the story moves foward, tired of reboots
[7:00:38] <RagnarokTahu> sol got his waifu back
[7:00:41] <SolxBaiken> My problem with GG lore is the fact that Overture is a soft reboot of the story and every game since is a contradictory mess
[7:00:44] <wavegen> after THAT MAN they're gonna have the real villain, THAT WOMAN
[7:00:46] <shikimagura> *shouldn't've
[7:00:58] <レヨメエ> @1shoryuken apparently the game still has oki
[7:01:09] <novahyou> @musashi8790 100% agreed. If not, it's just like an american comic, nothing would matter cause it gets rebooted in a couple of years
[7:01:09] <CorrodedS> The story of xrd will be continued in the new
[7:01:15] <CorrodedS> daisuke confirmed it
[7:01:27] <novahyou> which is also why if Blazblue 2 ever happens, I want the ending of CF to matter
[7:01:37] <+stealthblazer> Marvel's Guilty Gear
[7:01:39] <レヨメエ> @CorrodedS doesn't that mean HoS confirmed CAN'T be in?
[7:01:40] <musashi8790> Besides if it was a reboot, no Sin.
[7:01:42] <SolxBaiken> >>BB story
[7:01:44] <SolxBaiken> LOL

[7:02:13] <noorejji> @kupo_42 there's a summary of it at the beginning but it goes by really fast so better to watch it on youtube
[7:02:15] <lhayzeus> BlazRED: Blazblue 2
[7:02:17] <1shoryuken> hopefully BB gets a new engine
[7:02:18] <RagnarokTahu> @kupo_42 revelator gives you a recap of sign's story at the start
[7:02:26] <Fadedsun> They have to announce something worthwhile at the end of this
[7:02:31] <novahyou> @kupo_42 Honestly even if you play them all the story is all over the place. I prefer ACCENT CORE arcade endings over both SIGN & Revelator stories. Anyone else
[7:02:32] <kupo_42> I see I see atamThink
[7:02:38] <wavegen> will it still be sprites?

[7:02:56] <+duskyimperro> they're gonna announce an anji mito 3d platformer
[7:03:03] <kupo_42> Yeah I get the story right now is a mess but I just want to continue the story in gg2020 so I don't feel so lost
[7:03:07] <kupo_42> @pinecone_kun atamHug
[7:03:08] <1shoryuken> GG's lore can be summed up as "this is some really cool stuff, now how can i put this into what i have already done"

[7:04:08] <Fadedsun> @RagnarokTahu I changed my mind after many years. Both are great. This one goes harder as a full song to me.
[7:04:36] <SolxBaiken> It's not hard, it's just not a priority; the story isn't the main draw and is an afterthought and so quality checks are pretty fucking lax, especially since the Producers are the main ones at the helm and why fight them on it since they are why the game is happening at all? :V

[7:05:48] <noorejji> millia hat was cute, hope it stays
[7:05:49] <novahyou> @SolxBaiken I don't know if I entirely agree. A significant portion of the budget goes to the story mode so I think it either needs to be interesting or go back to just cool arcade endings with a nice picture

[7:06:43] <SolxBaiken> I'm not saying they don't work hard on the story mode stuff (I mean, they need to sell consumer copies somehow) but the actual thought process going into them is definitely more after thought than first priority
[7:06:45] <CorrodedS> @レヨメエ They had fun working with sprites I guess. Justice and kliff are not really changed from their X's appearance that much and they just added them in.
[7:06:47] <Maruseph> I hope Takehara can make it into the finals, but it would take a miracle.

[7:08:48] <axziel666> unless they keep it ride the fire
[7:08:49] <SolxBaiken> Honestly, it is clear Mori wants to be a light novel writer lulul

[7:09:33] <novahyou> @SolxBaiken Well yeah, they're always bashing BB's story but it makes a lot more sense than GG's. Daisuke mainly cares about chars being cool as hell in a heavy metal way

[7:10:31] <FaustCM> wish it was early
[7:10:31] <sals5> guilty hasn't started yet what
[7:10:37] <CorrodedS> GG has a pretty straight forward story, it just forces you to play a lot of story mode scenarios for different characters
[7:10:37] <musashi8790> Japanese exhibition incoming
[7:10:38] <noorejji> nah man if there are any big announcements left to be made regarding GG2020 before the end of the year, this is the time
[7:10:49] <レヨメエ> @novahyou you leave baiken alone, just because one dev can't properly properly space events doesn't mean her story is bad
[7:10:51] <sals5> didnt bbtag finish 2 hours ago
[7:10:52] <SolxBaiken> I actually prefer (old) GG (Missing Link~XX) because it was more character than narrative focused; BB turned me off with it's focus on plot, jargon, and extended universe material. Then Overture happened and GG tried to be like BB story structure wise :<
[7:11:05] <alexprice> stories of both bb and gg are really bad
[7:11:07] <Watson_dabox> GG story is on fanfic level of made up stupid shit LUL

[7:11:26] <FaustCM> yeah i hope
[7:11:27] <レヨメエ> @SolxBaiken to be fair i did like overture... but yeah the early guilty gears are where my heart lay story wise
[7:11:41] <Angel_Hinanawi> bb's lore is confusing for the sake of being confusing
[7:11:44] <novahyou> @レヨメエ I honestly did not understand what you were trying to say, but ok. Also, I like Baiken
[7:11:58] <CorrodedS> Daisuke is not a good writer, even though I really like GG lore and story
[7:12:02] <Angel_Hinanawi> i fast forwarded the story mode in cf just to unlock susanoo
[7:12:06] <artistofseer> "made up stupid shit"? more like "the word of Daisuke, our lord and savior" moopokThink
[7:12:06] <musashi8790> I just care about the Kiske family so... Don't mess with that lore.

[7:12:10] <Angel_Hinanawi> not a fan of visual novel
[7:12:16] <SolxBaiken> I liked Overture too, but then the issues that started out small only got worse by the time SIGN came, and if REVELATOR is any indicator, GG story ain't getting any better :<
[7:12:16] <RagnarokTahu> GG's lore is ridiculous but that's precisely why I love it
[7:12:25] <bit_crusherrr> whens anji bitcruThinking
[7:12:26] <novahyou> I like GG's lore up to Accent Core. I really don't care for Sign/Revelator except for a few gems such as Robo-Ky & Venom
[7:12:33] <CorrodedS> It's schlocky in a good way
[7:12:46] <Angel_Hinanawi> gg lore is straightforward, no multi dimensions stuffs
[7:12:49] <CorrodedS> While Unist is just schlocky anime TPFufun
[7:12:50] <artistofseer> @bit_crusherrr she didn't even make it in as a Yumi color in BBTAG
[7:12:51] <Watson_dabox> @artistofseer nah, youre thinking of the ost not the story Kappa
[7:12:55] <レヨメエ> @novahyou due to story posible errors, baiken's age is anywhere between 30 and over 100, depending on when the wars happened... look year doesn't matter all that matters is she wants revenge against that man
[7:12:57] <artistofseer> he
[7:12:59] <JackOforGG2020> in gg your son is your father Kappa
[7:13:09] <bit_crusherrr> @artistofseer Good, fuck Yumi, she's garbage

[7:14:04] <RagnarokTahu> @CT_Warrior yes :)
[7:14:05] <artistofseer> yeh moopokHeartbiki
[7:14:12] <SolxBaiken> the problem with Baiken's backstory is that Ishiwatari thought of a cool background before thinking out the actual A-to-Z of it all; which is kind of why all fighting games stories suck :V
[7:14:13] <Angel_Hinanawi> put susanoo and slayer in tekken
[7:14:14] <レヨメエ> @RagnarokTahu who let you in here Jebaited

[7:16:49] <RagnarokTahu> @レヨメエ he's been missing since GG1 :o
[7:16:59] <novahyou> @musashi8790 She already has more clothes in Rev 2. Or it seems that way
[7:17:01] <レヨメエ> i know right @RagnarokTahu maybe faust can help them look for him
[7:17:04] <MysticPyroFreak> @mitochondria_ph but still. to have him officially revealed two days before my birthday would just totally make it for me
[7:17:05] <RagnarokTahu> faust is not dr. baldhead what are you talking about Kappa
[7:17:05] <Sombreprism> No, Dr.Balhead is Faust
[7:17:07] <mitochondria_ph> @MysticPyroFreak not having faust in the game will be like not having luigi in smash
[7:17:08] <noorejji> nah man dr balhead is dead
[7:17:11] <+II_BoBo_II> i would honestly keep expectations low in terms of announcement. it would be cool to see a trailer but they didnt say anything at this point i dont think

[7:22:19] <MysticPyroFreak> @MayorofMoronMountain don't you dare
[7:22:25] <novahyou> What blows my mind about KOF is that they made the designs cheap YET APPEALING for the mobile game yet KOF 14 looked the way it looked...even after the patch
[7:22:26] <JackOforGG2020> no baiken no buyken
[7:22:26] <FestivalPeach66> SNK is memed to be popular with them tho

[7:22:52] <レヨメエ> @Sombreprism nah it's popular, kinda... but it also has a reputation for hard inputs (although the latest game fixed that, it still has that reputation to it)
[7:22:56] <SolxBaiken> everyone not in the base roster is going to be DLC #kappa

[8:48:55] <HolyKnightWilhelmTheIV> GG 2020 is not my GG! Give me Oki and combos, or give me death! The game is far too simplified and we can have a better game! Fight with me! Also the demo really does play like crap its really restrictive and changes are doable. So lets fight for it. Send feedback! Also Bridget is cool! Gear discord has some nice evidence showing a lack of depth if you want to discuss.
