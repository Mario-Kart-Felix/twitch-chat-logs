[0:04:07] <+shiranui8800> no need for negativity
[0:04:22] <+Wave_Kusanagi> How does chat feel about Chaos Code, if you've ever watched or played?
[0:04:23] <UnluckySpade7> Spread love to all arcsys games
[0:04:41] <rolanddegil> the page has two different names for the sub channel and twitch desktop app search finds neither
[0:04:57] <+Didusumthin> most of the cp remixes are disgustig
[0:05:02] <rolanddegil> @Wave_Kusanagi Rui for life!
[0:05:08] <+lfighterCN> Chaos code is like kof13 with anime gatlings
[0:05:18] <UnluckySpade7> CP remixes are great, dunno why all the complaints
[0:05:24] <dinHeld> Chat, let's try to keep the hydra dicks to a minimum today.
[0:05:27] <+FTZombies629> sol is out of place on that artwork
[0:05:34] <+Wave_Kusanagi> CP remixes were great. It just took folks awhile to get used to them.
[0:05:38] <johnyoly420> I think CP remixes are fine
[0:05:53] <ishidox1> sol is so detailed
[0:05:54] <+Wave_Kusanagi> He's out of place and inaccurate as heck. LUL
[0:05:57] <noorejji> I like some of the originals better
[0:06:01] <UnluckySpade7> Swol badguy
[0:06:06] <+shiranui8800> I think it looks good
[0:06:07] <SuavisLies> @FTZombies629 Youre right, they should remove the other losers and leave Sol
[0:06:16] <+marts12> by guilty gear gameplay do they mean gg2020????
[0:06:22] <noorejji> yes
[0:06:23] <ishidox1> ragna must stay
[0:06:24] <UnluckySpade7> yea
[0:06:26] <+shiranui8800> probably GG 2020 yes
[0:06:30] <johnyoly420> One of the remixes I’m not a fan of is Motor Head II. Motor Head > Motor Head II
[0:06:33] <+lfighterCN> widepeepoHappy
[0:06:35] <Coldhanded> RIP Oki
[0:06:38] <Tamashi_Splat> leave sol and ragna,
[0:06:46] <JChunter27> Where can I find the schedule?
[0:06:52] <noorejji> Rebellion > Rebellion II
[0:06:54] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Carl's II remix is unironically better than the first. Tager's II remix is inferior to the original, though
[0:07:03] <+FTZombies629> Awakening the Chaos 1 or Awakening the Chaos 2...which one is better?
[0:07:14] <johnyoly420> Awakening the Chaos 1 by a long shot imo
[0:07:17] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Rebllion II has great additions to the melody of the song, but the instrumentation of the original has it beat
[0:07:22] <MayorofMoronMountain> acekingoffsuit's twitter for schedule unless there's a command here
[0:07:23] <+ProtoT1> Motor Head II has its own charm
[0:07:38] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Awakening the Chaos II is INFINITELY better than the first one and I'll fight for that one.
[0:07:52] <noorejji> all of the new songs in CP are banger tho
[0:07:52] <strifeomo> can't wait for gg heads to whine
[0:08:04] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Both Gluttony Fangs are equally fantastic
[0:08:07] <NarcissistCactus> noel feet
[0:08:10] <GhostRiderPR> Endless Despair when?
[0:08:16] <+ProtoT1> Mai’s theme sounds like anime
[0:08:19] <UnluckySpade7> Wagner armpits
[0:08:21] <johnyoly420> Gluttony Fang II is a banger
[0:08:24] <Doctorsixer> VoteYea Noel is good VoteNay Noel is bad
[0:08:25] <+Didusumthin> the remixes weren't done by ishiwatari, that's why most of the are lackluster
[0:08:26] <+sakVIII> arakune bathwater
[0:08:32] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Nightmare Fiction II definitely isn't as good as the original, though.
[0:08:34] <noorejji> VoteYea
[0:08:34] <rolanddegil> arcsystemworkssub seems to be the sub channel

[0:34:55] <datmouse> @reddies what do you even mean
[0:34:55] <Trarnarok> @CharlestonJew yeah but pretty much every char in bb has their own play style, so its like fighting a different game with each

[0:38:25] <+CharlestonJew> GGPO recently put their stuff out open source, and it seems that implementing GGPO is fairly complicated and might not be the best option for every game

[0:40:19] <+StalwartSoul> Es ResidentSleeper
[0:40:29] <aftertokotone> ggpo can be applied to a game that is capable of doing replays iirc
[0:40:31] <zelst> ragna BibleThump
[0:40:33] <XBloom_> Skullgirls implemeted rollback and they dind't have warner brothers money dawg
[0:40:35] <reddies> T7 is the most popular online fighting game and it doesn't have rollback

[0:40:52] <Sapphire_829> Raggy <3 <3
[0:40:52] <phantomnull00> @powa315 it can but a lot of fundamental code in the game has to be changed from the ground up. Very expensive/resource intensive. Only MKX has done it.
[0:40:55] <+CharlestonJew> T7's netcode could be a lot better tho, popular != quality
[0:40:56] <reddies> makes you wonder how essential it is
[0:41:00] <Powa315> I see I see
[0:41:03] <HeroicSlime> @reddies online is mad jank compared to offline because of that
[0:41:03] <Grindelo> tekken netcode is trash

[0:41:51] <grandabx> Hi!!
[0:42:10] <zappasghost> me :)
[0:42:10] <phantomnull00> I don’t plan on buying GG2020 but them having GGPO would make it a day 1 buy.
[0:42:12] <Powa315> I just wish bbtag would get it somehow since it's arcsys' big title atm
[0:42:27] <Newbhope> damn such a good burst
[0:42:28] <DarkOniro> FeelsAmazingMan
[0:42:32] <bon3fgc> stop buying the games and see how they put GGPO the next day
[0:42:35] <Dagoth2hu> an yeah rollback is even more important for small games to have dedicated online communities and tournaments where people can play between any countries
[0:42:42] <muctarr22> is this tournement open or only ppl that qualified?
[0:42:43] <+nobleknight69> are Majin Obama and Jiyuna commentating there?
[0:42:45] <UnluckySpade7> Carnage scissor her ass
[0:42:52] <DarkOniro> Dayum !
[0:42:53] <+AzurePhoenix86> T7's netcode is very subpar. Popularity doesn't equal quality
[0:42:54] <ragnanivank18> raw gauntlet hit
[0:42:56] <Powa315> Yeah small games have people all over the place
[0:43:13] <+hoggo_chan> i come back and people are shitting on rollback
[0:43:17] <torrenz420> look at those puddings VoHiYo
[0:43:29] <notblob> imagine not wanting ggpo in every fg ever

[0:45:17] <quang0d> no I mean like
[0:45:20] <waranoi> never shutting up about ggpo and no one can stop me
[0:45:21] <bon3fgc> @XBloom_It's the only way these people understand by pocket
[0:45:23] <Vekysus_Arashi> You should ask for Rollback, because it's the best solution now, but a game not having it does not make said game bad on all points
[0:45:24] <heykoop> anyone who doesnt want ggpo is a cop
[0:45:26] <Picupw> Fuck yeah fuck Es :)
[0:45:27] <sinshenlong> sigh s tier es
[0:45:34] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Sounds like the people trying to shit on GGPO are just people who are tired of hearing about ti but don't actually know what it is or what they're talking about. lol
[0:45:38] <quang0d> no I mean like fuck off, Es
[0:45:39] <Kuroi_Kaze_> Esu kdubLove
[0:45:45] <+CharlestonJew> it
[0:45:47] <aftertokotone> delay supporters deny climate change
[0:45:49] <Powa315> u gotta talk about ggpo till it happens, it's not a big thing yet even tho it's been available
[0:45:53] <torrenz420> @quang0d lewd cantaBaka
[0:45:57] <+BossmanPOJO> bossma6Blush
[0:45:59] <quang0d> that confirm was illegal
[0:46:05] <+PathEnder> y'all never stop asking for ggpo. the moment you stop the moment they forget about it
[0:46:06] <+Lennox517> is Es top tier?
[0:46:08] <sinho737> NotLikeThis
[0:46:11] <+ThatGuyGandhi> why would anyone want rollback, SFV has rollback and its trash
[0:46:16] <Powa315> iirc she's high tier
[0:46:17] <deevan> embriyo storage
[0:46:20] <MC_Veks> not wanting ggpo is the same level of IQ as believing flat earth
[0:46:21] <torrenz420> es is honest
[0:46:23] <Newbhope> PogChamp
[0:46:23] <S0nFr0st> OD anti air

[0:46:28] <DarkOniro> monkaS !
[0:46:29] <johnyoly420> That was nasty
[0:46:30] <quang0d> Es is S tier lol
[0:46:30] <ragnanivank18> aren't both of Es' distortions safe though?
[0:46:33] <+hoggo_chan> the only arcgame that will be using ggpo in 2020 is guilty gear
[0:46:34] <+Wave_Kusanagi> SF5 is trash overall. Bad example
[0:46:37] <sinshenlong> lets go!
[0:46:37] <waranoi> sfv doesn't have ggpo, a well implemented ropllback that is free now too
[0:46:40] <+smashingTofu> Lessgo allen
[0:46:42] <aftertokotone> @ThatGuyGandhi because SFV implemented rollback in the worst way possible
[0:46:42] <+heedayo_cojimmer> If only we could talk about the match instead of netcode
[0:46:43] <bon3fgc> the Japanese have to understand that they should improve their games{
[0:46:45] <datmouse> @ThatGuyGandhi you really gonna take lil jimmy the intern's homebrew netcode as the example huh
[0:46:48] <zelst> sf5 is the global warming of climate change
[0:46:49] <+yusufestacado> Imagine BBTAG being the most hardcore anime FTG after year 2020
[0:46:51] <XBloom_> SFV was the first time Capcom implemented rollback, which was made in house btw
[0:46:55] <MeteorDMsyu> lol as if gg will have ggpo
[0:46:58] <+Lennox517> who are the top tiers? been out of the loop for this game for a good min
[0:47:03] <Powa315> Isn't sfv's netcode worse than normal delay based?
[0:47:03] <+CharlestonJew> SF5's netcode was done by 1 dude
[0:47:06] <oathoblivionx> Delay supporters are flat earthers
[0:47:07] <waranoi> izayoi and izanami
[0:47:08] <DarkOniro> RIP FeelsBadMan
[0:47:11] <+hoggo_chan> nah bruh theyre so annoyed they will add ggpo

[0:47:33] <+yusufestacado> @MC_Veks That would be better
[0:47:40] <IamJames4649> es is way better in cf than tag
[0:47:43] <K_ross> She’s worse here
[0:47:44] <Samosiv> @XBloom_ it wasn't inhouse, it was outsourced to 1 guy in korea who made netcode for a few mobile games
[0:47:45] <aftertokotone> Es in bbtag has no legs
[0:47:47] <waranoi> also after sfv capcom tried it again with mvci and mvci netcode is VERY good
[0:47:47] <deevan> KAGEmusha code Lmao
[0:47:49] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Ouch. That stung. Maybe there'll be a better Ragna later
[0:47:50] <+nobleknight69> SFV saved esports
[0:47:53] <PressionePlay> Es is S tier, big buttons, ioh, good projectiles, confirm from basically everything

[0:53:07] <Vekysus_Arashi> @bon3fgc the game is already made, if it does not have GGPO natively it will need to go through the same process, and that means basically remaking the game, so yeah, we don't know the Netcode they are using, if it's not GGPO it will be as hard as MKX

[1:40:13] <boostingwarlord> mudamudamuda
[1:40:17] <Seph4096> im rooting for Litchi so long as Izayoi is not in the other side lol

[2:26:47] <KosmicKato> LUL
[2:26:48] <universelion> Lmao, Elphelts has no right to complain about cheap kills. However, I do understand.
[2:26:51] <WTFTreeman> lucille monkaS

[2:27:11] <UnluckySpade7> Venom really needs a haircut lmao
[2:27:22] <Hasssun> Venom is perfect just the way he is
[2:27:23] <madhatterbest> @universelion true. But you know that is a great option here
[2:27:27] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @UnluckySpade7 Terrible taste. His long hair is beautiful
[2:27:27] <fatally_furious> @unluckyspade7 he got one in the story

[2:27:34] <Joshking_111> When is lostsoul?
[2:27:34] <+konnakol> @OrihalconAlloy I get that. I just think that, on a philosophical level, letting players lose off of a successful defense is.... not cool.

[2:27:40] <ifly4pocky> @Didusumthin thank you

[2:27:55] <nigawa123> nice read
[2:28:00] <OrionSpeedwagon> @konnakol it’s not successful defense if they died to chip
[2:28:03] <anthraxexe> venon is cool as fuck. if I ever get into GG im playing him
[2:28:03] <madhatterbest> wonder if supers chip kill in the new gg?
[2:28:07] <+PhantomExdeath> Tasty Steve at ArcRevo and not at the last TWT event? PogChamp
[2:28:09] <MasterIcarus7> i like chip kills in GG because it forces you to play aggressively and prevents turtling
[2:28:12] <+konnakol> @OrionSpeedwagon they blocked the move, what ore do you want?
[2:28:16] <Neonyze> @madhatterbest They do
[2:28:16] <fatally_furious> venom's hair is still long, just he literally cut ties with the guild by shedding the logo from his hair
[2:28:21] <OrionSpeedwagon> There’s resources to stop chip
[2:28:23] <schwis_orifice> Jebaited
[2:28:24] <+Soruxt> If I whip your ass in neutral then you deserve to be chipped out and its a strategy as well

[2:29:28] <Red_delta> hopefully the demo feedback is universally negative
[2:29:33] <st4rz___> @Lennox517 It is but also so much fun
[2:29:36] <universelion> Yeh, Elphelt lost. Progress to mankind.
[2:29:36] <bzeeb> trying to hard read bursts is not worth it
[2:29:37] <fatally_furious> i think supers should chip kill on normal defend, but only where meter carries over
[2:29:38] <+marionettesky> stalalaBork snow time
[2:29:42] <Monaka623> やるね
[2:29:44] <madhatterbest> @YourAverageAsian888 it's likely to me

[2:30:14] <Hasssun> degenerate Elphelts
[2:30:17] <+konnakol> @fatally_furious I'm less not okay with having supers kill with chip. I'm very not okay with normals or specials chip kill
[2:30:21] <sinshenlong> exactly
[2:30:23] <universelion> Mankind knew they cannot change society. So, instead of blaming on themselves, they blame Elphelts. But, they found beauty in the lives of Elphelts, and they cannot lie to themselves about it.
[2:30:23] <+HerFavoriteColor_> oh shit Red!
[2:30:23] <Rupture_EX> Puppey is that you?
[2:30:29] <ZakeSWE> BOBBIS GOOO
[2:30:31] <Red_delta> wait is this one of my guys
[2:30:33] <rolanddegil> I don't think GG incentivizes aggressive play well, I should be able to feint, but nope, we have that stupid Negative Penalty
[2:30:35] <Hasssun> @YourAverageAsian888 I think the king of all Johnnys and all of GG Xrd is here.

[2:30:56] <OrionSpeedwagon> in GG you avoid chip with meter, if you don’t use that meter to avoid chip death that’s bad defense on your part

[2:32:58] <rolanddegil> @OrihalconAlloy I'm saying there's not enough ways to mess with opponent's timing, they see you running, if they're familiar with the match up, they can intercept pretty well. yes I'm aware of IAD and using Faultless to halt your run

[2:43:21] <n00bs4brkfst> Tell me about Faust why does he wear the mask?
[2:43:27] <+NewtRecruit> @madhatterbest I'd rather have Sharon in gg2020 than Slayer without oki

[2:43:35] <+chicknpattie> thats a cool shirt
[2:43:37] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Ragna gets in Smash, but every he says gets bleeped out ingame LUL
[2:43:38] <Disnag> if I took off that bag would he die
[2:43:38] <universelion> I know who I am. The moonlight lake called me. This is who I am. My fangs are so long. My nails are sharper than ice. That is me. I wonder what that will prove?

[2:43:48] <SmashSK> Faust had no mask in GG1 I think
[2:43:54] <Phronesis59> GG2020 will play like Street Fighter, unfortunately. The ‘’give us your feedback’’ is just PR bullcrap

[4:14:15] <FestivalPeach66> yeah other way around
[4:14:35] <DryGuy84> Chat arguing about obvious shit. LUL
[4:14:37] <DragoDragon55> the final round lets go
[4:14:37] <+TempXa> Love Ky's simple and clean gameplay.
[4:14:38] <HeavenInHerArms> @Crushingon google it and don't emarass yourself anymore
[4:14:39] <TheFinalSentinel> @Crushingon Strike that. Reverse it.
[4:14:47] <muctarr22> @schmoofaka just recognized the name and char
[4:14:50] <Shiiinobu> crushingon prolly a smash player
[4:14:56] <boogeyman551> can a hitbox be a waifu as well? cirThink
[4:14:56] <fatally_furious> @shiiinobu ^
[4:14:59] <rolanddegil> @Crushingon 'hitbox' was coined before 'hurtbox' so hitbox got the most obvious thing, the rectangles representing the attack
[4:15:03] <kokujin_> when the diddlybox touches the wigglybox you take damage
[4:15:04] <dizzydizzylaugh> SeemsGood
[4:15:04] <PVL_93_RU> Characters are literally walking hurboxes, how does someone not know this in 2019 atpCap
[4:15:12] <SmashSK> The classic jab 5h frame trap
[4:15:19] <neuronova> o start up moves have 1 frame startup :)
[4:15:20] <HeavenInHerArms> @kokujin_ atpRtsd atpRtsd
[4:15:22] <muctarr22> !bracket
[4:15:32] <rolanddegil> 'hurtbox' is specifically the character area vulnerable during an attack
[4:15:37] <arrrirafita> Asking a question? What hell is wrong with you?
[4:15:50] <Rygzz> !bracket
[4:15:51] <schmoofaka> for example, Faust's hurtbox is dumb
[4:15:56] <fatally_furious> when the whosy-whatsit collides with the thinga-ma-bobber damage happens
[4:16:07] <amdogwoof> what about in fighterz when ur a tracking hitbox
[4:16:15] <+HydroSting> Who tf out here playing kum tho
[4:16:16] <DryGuy84> It's fine to not understand what a hurtbox is, it's not fine to act like you do when you don't.
[4:16:20] <fatally_furious> @amdogwoof ask a Blanka player
[4:16:21] <DekkuFina> Welcome to the FGC Boys
[4:16:27] <PVL_93_RU> @fatally_furious how am I supposed to play guessies with this knowledge
[4:16:28] <schmoofaka> Foo... probably best NA Kum
[4:16:29] <SmashSK> Yeah throws are 1f but have priority over strikes so are a reversal
[4:16:30] <neuronova> hitbox hits, hut box hurts. i don't see what the problem is here

[5:16:26] <blackkanye> Goodbye Yosuke BibleThump

[5:18:44] <FG_Ramza> Seth also feels bad which just makes me want to play UNI
[5:18:46] <K_ross> Odds of seeing Seth players?

[5:19:05] <FG_Ramza> @K_ross High, he's quite good
[5:19:08] <+ikasukiz> when the character select is so trash that you make your own *physical* CSS and bring it to an official tournament
[5:19:08] <+Frozen_Lights> Is that the Qanba Crown?
[5:19:15] <+OgGeek2016> The select screen is fine
[5:19:16] <spinal329> The character select we neer
[5:19:18] <gamedefier> Ragna / Yu is my team, I love Ragna's kit so much evo19Laugh

[5:19:41] <+Buksunny> yo
[5:19:44] <imcyder2> The character select needs more Blitztank, way more.
[5:19:45] <punk_ass_abe> current character select is hardly a character select
[5:19:50] <+PhantomExdeath> only fun thing about bbtag Linne is triple jump

[5:42:46] <FG_Ramza> i think

[5:42:59] <thiagohimself> is the tank playable yet?
[5:42:59] <NinaGoemod> It's funny how Hyde never really got debuffed but he's just fallen off of comp play
[5:43:00] <ProsecutorYayoi> Hyde got a wall bounce follow-up after ORBITA
[5:43:00] <gamedefier> @leon619dfa Ragna discord shared some footage of 2.0 showing why stronger health drain.
[5:43:03] <MegaMeister> Dora was looking like TheArm for 5 seconds to me
[5:43:35] <FG_Ramza> Hyde's not bad. But why play him when you can plat Yang, Mitsuru or Akihiko
[5:43:37] <leon619dfa> @gamedefier i need to check, i was o final terms of my university so i not have idea of that
[5:43:53] <K_ross> Jude got buffed yeah
[5:43:56] <FG_Ramza> I'm surprised Kubo plays him when Yuzu/Seth is a perfectly good team
[5:44:08] <+Frozen_Lights> how big are the Blake buffs? 👀
[5:44:09] <gamedefier> @Willothewisps He only got EX Bend Sinister as far as I'm aware. Really helps his bad solo damage but it won't make him high teir or anything.

[8:14:52] <+c1assybadger> Then dont play her
[8:14:53] <schwis_orifice> skd about to complain on twitter about unfair seeding
[8:15:11] <shadowswordsman2471> does he really do that?
[8:15:23] <STenSatsu> it's kind of what he's known for
[8:15:23] <Euchre_AFGC> SKD isn't a one trick, but he will pretty much only play Izayoi in bracket to my knowledge
[8:15:27] <sibladeKO> skd a fragile boy but i ain't hear a thing about seeding
[8:15:29] <shu_plays_kusoge> F
[8:15:33] <schwis_orifice> EZ

[8:16:34] <humbledojo> So do cf fans like cross tag? Or nah

[8:16:48] <ev2leggki9qd> 決勝なのにいまいち盛り上がってない
[8:16:51] <Euchre_AFGC> I certainly dont like cross tag. A lot of CF fans do. A lot of CF fans dont
[8:16:51] <+TheRealRedHavoc> That's stream chat for ya
[8:16:58] <spikycactus> tfw naoto doesn't play naoto
[8:16:59] <Rennovious> I like crosstag since its just whacky fun but I sink most of my time into BBCF since it's just such a solid game.
[8:17:03] <UsernameCrisis> Naoto not playing naoto
[8:17:04] <gryffinp> I'm not really a fan of cross tag.
[8:17:08] <ev2leggki9qd> カプコンの方に人取られたか？
[8:17:09] <WaviDeity> I love seeing good Litchi play
[8:17:20] <BlackGatoAcer> Stream sound?
[8:17:20] <boostingwarlord> bbtag has elizabeth and im sold on that
[8:17:24] <theeasiest1> I'm personally lukewarm towards cross tag
[8:17:24] <+CottonSC> Does anyone in this play Naoto?

[8:17:28] <mimorinislove> Rachel mirrors the best
[8:17:30] <schwis_orifice> most CF fans dont fuck with crosstag because they expected Blazblue 2 and didnt get it so they bitch and whine.
[8:17:37] <sibladeKO> this ev2 guy is really something
[8:17:38] <%Jotamide> It might sound revolutionary but one can like both Tag and CF, crazy I know
[8:17:40] <Seph4096> Lmao Flux
[8:17:41] <boostingwarlord> look at the man on the left he looks like a fish lmao
[8:17:41] <DivineJay> rwbycross tag battle
[8:17:45] <yaminegira13> i wonder if jiyuna will ever commentate a tour finals
[8:17:46] <Liransherman> this is pretty cursed
[8:17:48] <gryffinp> I'm pretty sure that the reason cross tag exists is that someone at arcsys really really wanted to make a RWBY game and that was the only way they could talk everyone else into doing it
[8:17:50] <micmic112> ?!?!
[8:17:51] <+Soniti> oh god rachel mirrors are weird
[8:17:51] <S0nFr0st> @schwis_orifice Ok buddy
[8:17:53] <nope2500> naoto not playing naoto.........
[8:17:54] <anthraxexe> lol siblade ive been google translating it as he went
[8:17:57] <neuronova> cf is just soo much better in almost every way
[8:17:57] <Rennovious> Oh wow Rachel Mirror
[8:17:58] <humbledojo> I wanted to start playing bb after watching gallileo and was waiting for the new one. Then i tried it (cross tag) and wasnt a fan. Im thinking of picking up cf
[8:18:17] <Graveblaze> I think Rachel might win this one
[8:18:17] <STenSatsu> Mori always talked about loving RWBY so you are probably right Gryffn
[8:18:18] <Silver_Evans1> rachel...mirror ?
[8:18:18] <Rennovious> The last character I ever expected to see a Mirror of was Rachel
[8:18:26] <DivineJay> @humbledojo cf is really fun it's worth it
[8:18:29] <anthraxexe> tag is a different game. I like CF so I play CF
[8:18:29] <+Sanicboomer> well
[8:18:31] <Mrn6t4> tag plays nothing like an actual blazblue game
[8:18:32] <%Jotamide> Also, Tag lives in the minds of CF players rent-free. No one ever mentions CF in Tag chat lmao
[8:18:33] <humbledojo> I want to play rwby characters tho
[8:18:34] <schwis_orifice> my blazblue centralfiction™ main since 2008 doesnt play in bbtag like it does in the last bbcf patch BabyRage trash game

[8:19:31] <traellium> Is Hibiki beginner friendly?
[8:19:35] <gryffinp> on the other hand cross tag lets you play a team of Naoto and Naoto so that's something in it's favor
[8:19:35] <STenSatsu> yes
[8:19:36] <UsernameCrisis> Fun Fact: Tag was originally just a RWBY fighting game, but the team didn't have the budget for it--so, crossover.
[8:19:38] <FluxedOver> yeah hibiki is fine
[8:19:38] <sii_4> yeah
[8:19:39] <shadowswordsman2471> yes
[8:19:39] <anthraxexe> hibiki is a great beginner character
[8:19:45] <boostingwarlord> this man has great fingers

[8:19:52] <schwis_orifice> @UsernameCrisis source?
[8:19:54] <BenjiCake> naoto eats his veggies thats why he does so much damage
[8:19:55] <humbledojo> @fluxedover i feel that. I play xrd and im bracing for gg2020 now. I figure it could be a similar occurence
[8:19:56] <neuronova> right, its not bb. the name doesn't represent series. small gripe but def valid
[8:19:56] <Seph4096> Aside from Tag being the focus idc either way, no opinion on it personally

[8:20:25] <Graveblaze> I believe it
[8:20:25] <FG_Ramza> Naoto plays Naoto huh
[8:20:38] <anthraxexe> isn't this an awful MU for naoto?
[8:20:38] <Seph4096> Naruto is def not Rachel Kappa
[8:20:39] <Bloo561> oofff
[8:20:46] <BenjiCake> @Zagorsek they both play rachel but i think naoto is playing just for the matchup
[8:20:50] <Liransherman> C H O P
[8:20:55] <neuronova> yo, rachel has an adventure time pallet in tag <3 <3
[8:20:56] <spikycactus> Rachel the next hokage

[8:21:08] <Seph4096> Lmfao

[8:21:20] <JackOforGG2020> you mean hoekage Kappa
[8:21:20] <%Jotamide> George got yeeted
[8:21:24] <schwis_orifice> cross tag is a fine fighting game by itself, blazblue fans just expected pure blazblue and didnt get it, therefore they hate it and blame bbcf 2.0 death / lack of updates on it.
[8:21:29] <FG_Ramza> Naoto is too big brain for me
[8:21:39] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> george nooo

[8:22:14] <Seph4096> ^
[8:22:15] <shadowswordsman2471> it's not so much cross tag being different, it's more like cross tag being something kinda bad
[8:22:21] <Mrn6t4> ^
[8:22:22] <gryffinp> Guilty Gear's new theme has "bullshit *blazing*", the match intro dialogue talks about "the Beasts", GG 2020 is actually GGXBB, Ragna and Jin reveal trailer sunday night, mark my words.
[8:22:22] <schwis_orifice> well true but it wont get more updates ever
[8:22:23] <+Wave_Kusanagi> MUH SLASH KAIDO
[8:22:27] <neuronova> @schwis_orifice nahh, man don't generalize it. bbtag is not for everyone.
[8:22:32] <JackOforGG2020> @schwis_orifice ok dude we get it

[8:22:35] <anthraxexe> Cf still has a sizeable and dedicated playerbase

[8:23:09] <Bloo561> we'll take it!
[8:23:10] <+KingKien> @schwis_orifice nah it's more than that. I'm new to playing BB. I tried cross tag demo and it felt completely different from BBCF. I like BBCF more
[8:23:13] <shadowswordsman2471> gotta love naoto
[8:23:15] <Seph4096> CF is p damn good as is
[8:23:16] <+erkicman> DAMN
[8:23:19] <Jamershinobioneobi02> Here we go again with "tag bad huur duur"
[8:23:28] <Powa315> u can make a ggpo mod for the game?
[8:23:33] <Euchre_AFGC> CF DOESNT need any updates. CF2.0 is an excellent balance patch. if they do a 3.0, they might screw it up
[8:23:34] <shadowswordsman2471> hey, not our fault it is
[8:23:39] <+PERFECTCOMBO> tag is bad Kappa
[8:23:39] <+c1assybadger> bbtag is more like marvel than CF
[8:23:44] <EXonestar> Every single tournament - someone has to say "X game is dead" + "No it's not" > While watching a Tourney with the game being played... Just watch the tournament ...jeez
[8:23:44] <%Jotamide> I love that Kaid's caption on Dustloop wiki is "S P A C I N G into death" LUL
[8:23:44] <anthraxexe> buff lambu
[8:23:45] <+gigaturok> @pow2009 it takes too long to make a caster for a recent game
[8:23:49] <CrescentEXE> JUST RUN AT HER
[8:23:49] <FG_Ramza> People are making GGPO mods for GGAC+R
[8:23:50] <WaviDeity> CF2.0 is very balanced as is
[8:23:50] <schwis_orifice> @Kuroi_Kaze_ well it has mostly blazblue characters, maybe if they called it arcsys allstars or something?
[8:23:53] <shu_plays_kusoge> oof messed up enDDP
[8:23:59] <TigerClaws12> CF needs GGPO, that's a needed update :^)
[8:24:00] <Rennovious> Just fix Noel in CF 2.0 and we're golden
[8:24:02] <ZEML> modding in rollback netcode is difficult if the game isn't designed for it or compatible by accident
[8:24:02] <gryffinp> Naoto is so weird in concept, arcsys made a weird psuedo-ripoff of their own main character for a spinoff and then put him into the main game
[8:24:03] <pow2009> @gigaturok that sounds like quitter talk
[8:24:04] <Liransherman> @EXonestar MK2 is dead Kappa
[8:24:08] <+burichan> Ronald McDonald is fucking that goth kid up.
[8:24:09] <Euchre_AFGC> BBtag isn't so much bad as it is wack, but it's wack because it's a tag game and that's just kind of the state of things

[8:24:18] <FG_Ramza> @schwis_orifice Only 2 of the games are by arc sys
[8:24:18] <PegAsi_Aviation> BBCF is the game im loving right now, but BBTAG is still really good, its a good mahvel replacement
[8:24:19] <CrescentEXE> WOW
[8:24:22] <+TeeJayVA> that DP
[8:24:22] <canvas7> PogChamp
[8:24:23] <+PathEnder> rachel you illusive bitch 😡
[8:24:24] <+Wintwin33> Can BBCF players go one day without shitting on BBTAG you dont see BBTAG players talking shit about this game lmao just live and let live
[8:24:24] <shadowswordsman2471> damn, the pick up
[8:24:26] <neuronova> each charecter is so shallow. sure you got tag mechanics. But if you dont, LOVE tag games, its a really shallow fighter
[8:24:27] <Vashido22> BBTAG is mad fun
[8:24:31] <WaviDeity> just make a small patch for Noel and terumi
[8:24:33] <shu_plays_kusoge> lets go naoto
[8:24:40] <TheHeartsSweet> as a bbtag and bbcf player fuck both of yall let's get it
[8:24:43] <JackOforGG2020> imagine having 2 button dp sajamSegue4
[8:24:45] <+PeridotLoL> imo CF is a lot more fun to watch than tag
[8:24:45] <$GF202020> Live and let Die is a good song though Kappa
[8:24:46] <Rennovious> Terumi doesn't need to be strong he needs to stay fun
[8:24:49] <Seph4096> Lmao
[8:24:50] <+Wintwin33> This man said shallow
[8:24:54] <+PathEnder> did someone say shit on bbtag 👀
[8:24:55] <BenjiCake> make terumi fun and strong
[8:24:55] <powerburial> i mean yeah if you dont liek tag games dont play bbtag??
[8:24:57] <schwis_orifice> saying bbcf is fine and needs no more updates is delusion at its finest.
[8:25:01] <Not_Dragonspenc> This Rachel colour looks good
[8:25:02] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> i don't think bbtag is bad, i jsut think it's too different from mainline bb, and that's probably why bb players don't like it
[8:25:05] <%Jotamide> @Wintwin33 imagine having almost 4k viewers for CF in 2019 and chat be "but BBTAG tho"
[8:25:06] <wirelupin> Bbtag got me into cf, no bully plz
[8:25:08] <CrescentEXE> THIS GUY
[8:25:14] <FG_Ramza> Also I don't like BBTAG as a marvel replacement
[8:25:16] <Vashido22> @pressingbuttonsonwakeup that's completely fair tbh
[8:25:17] <STenSatsu> Naoto needs a ham color
[8:25:22] <Kuroi_Kaze_> @schwis_orifice yeah, smthng like that could do.

[8:26:04] <KevAb> It's not after super flash, it's on the first frames of the animation
[8:26:06] <NonoV2> it's her only invincible move, so why not
[8:26:08] <+TheRealRedHavoc> I'll take BBCF Extend with rollback netcode please
[8:26:08] <Rennovious> Rachel Astral is faster than a Jab lmaoooooo
[8:26:09] <%Jotamide> All CF needs to be a perfect game is Kajun playable. Also, bring back the dub
[8:26:14] <schwis_orifice> @Seph4096 arent lots of characters actual garbage tier?
[8:26:22] <shadowswordsman2471> not really
[8:26:26] <STenSatsu> Kajun and Taro Kreygasm
[8:26:27] <mitochondria_ph> This naoto player prioritizes winning over his physical health of his hands
[8:26:29] <Skargust> L M A O
[8:26:30] <sibladeKO> this man is wilding out of control
[8:26:30] <+PeridotLoL> Just Noel pretty sure
[8:26:32] <BenjiCake> WHAT IS THE MAN
[8:26:32] <Rennovious> Just Noel is Garbage tier.
[8:26:32] <+Wave_Kusanagi> I wish that worked
[8:26:33] <tenshinokumo> lol
[8:26:33] <CrescentEXE> this guy is literally a madman
[8:26:35] <shu_plays_kusoge> bad execution lul
[8:26:35] <micmic112> that was too big brain for me
[8:26:36] <Mimeblade> BBCF needs Unlimited Susanooh
[8:26:36] <+Wintwin33> @euchre_afgc Shallow in that they dont have their full kit in other non-tag games then sure. But in the context of bbtag its fine
[8:26:38] <Euchre_AFGC> the characters in bbtag are literally stripped down versions of their original selves, how is that not shallow? the games systems allow for the game being deep. If you removed all of the assists and cross combo junk, it would be hella snore
[8:26:42] <+erkicman> Come on, Joaquin Phoenix Naoto!
[8:26:42] <Not_Dragonspenc> Send in the frogs
[8:26:43] <Bloo561> THAT WAS ALMOST GODLIKE
[8:26:45] <gryffinp> I want a "Blazblue 2" on the unreal engine with that GG tech
[8:26:50] <mitochondria_ph> My hand hurts just looking at this
[8:26:53] <+Kekezo> wait this person's tag is literally just naoto?
[8:26:55] <+BossmanPOJO> MakeNoelAnActualCharacter
[8:26:58] <anthraxexe> noel and celica are pretty terrible. everyone else is viable, though some characters are stronger or weaker than others
[8:27:01] <micmic112> makki can't IB, naoto has been IBing everything
[8:27:03] <lumai42> just put ragna in gg2020
[8:27:05] <Bloo561> Yes @Kekezo
[8:27:09] <+Wave_Kusanagi> WOOWAT
[8:27:11] <sibladeKO> ah to make a game shallow you just remove the mechanics I see I see
[8:27:12] <FG_Ramza> Bullet is bad
[8:27:13] <Euchre_AFGC> WHAT LMAO THAT WAS SICK
[8:27:14] <Mack_Toonight> Put Az in GG2020
[8:27:14] <+CharlestonJew> @Euchre_AFGC "remove all the tag mechanics from a tag game" well duh of course thats gonna be boring
[8:27:15] <spikycactus> @micmic112 cause naoto plays rachel
[8:27:15] <+Kekezo> that's advanced
[8:27:16] <Seph4096> Nr tbh, like 5 drew the short stick, everyone in the game is terrifying * In the right hands *
[8:27:17] <MayorofMoronMountain> @euchre_afgc "if the game was totally different it would be boring" what
[8:27:21] <micmic112> i think that's why naoto's been pretty brave at mashing because of all his IBs
[8:27:25] <ev2leggki9qd> ボイスは英語なのか？レイチェルの声なんか変だな。
[8:27:29] <Rennovious> People say Kagura is garbage but he's really not. Kagura gets so much average damage you just gotta make hard reads off of anything to do anything thats why people say he's not that good.
[8:27:32] <+Wave_Kusanagi> KICKBACK
[8:27:33] <+TMoGenius> "Just remove all the mechaics of the game and it will be really boring" 4Head
[8:27:36] <Vashido22> @euchre_afgc of course removing shit would make it shallow
[8:27:36] <+erkicman> GODLIKE
[8:27:38] <FluxedOver> euchre you really just can't stop hating on something for a whole minute huh
[8:27:38] <shu_plays_kusoge> LOL
[8:27:40] <schwis_orifice> bullet makoto lambda kagura are viable?
[8:27:41] <Euchre_AFGC> Yeah no shit

[8:27:59] <shadowswordsman2471> the hand sacrifice was worth it
[8:27:59] <shu_plays_kusoge> THE FORBIDDEN MOVE
[8:28:04] <%Jotamide> Wasted CMVs alone bump up Kagura a tier up
[8:28:07] <mitochondria_ph> @ev2leggki9qd no it's in japanese

[8:28:11] <+PeridotLoL> There are some good
[8:28:14] <Seph4096> Ppl heavily downplay the "bottom" 10-15 chars
[8:28:17] <Euchre_AFGC> Y'all act like I said something thinking it was some unknown shit. The point I was making is homie said the characters werent shallow.
[8:28:21] <+Wintwin33> Just let people enjoy what they like hating on bbtag ain't gonna get yall more players lmao
[8:28:30] <Rabbit_Fu_> When's Arakune?
[8:28:31] <+PathEnder> i miss kagura :( i wouldn't want him added to bbtag though
[8:28:32] <Mimeblade> Naoto mastery with Naoto

[8:28:38] <FG_Ramza> dora boutta hit top 8 pog
[8:28:39] <Euchre_AFGC> and they are, it's the systems that make things.. not shallow

[8:28:51] <+Toast9> jiyuSad jiyuSad jiyuSad
[8:28:59] <FluxedOver> they're playing through winners first
[8:29:03] <micmic112> @Mattocat it's winners
[8:29:03] <WaviDeity> can chat stop hating on bbtag and just focus on CF
[8:29:03] <ScrubPlayer> jin players rise up
[8:29:05] <ev2leggki9qd> 日本語なのか。ガードしてる時のレイチェルの声が変に聞こえてた。
[8:29:06] <+PathEnder> what's that? keep shitting on games because it won't stop people from playing their favorite games anyway Kappa
[8:29:11] <humbledojo> Yo im not even a bb player, my bad for asking about tag in here LOL. I should have known this would happen
[8:29:11] <Vashido22> the characters are toned down for sure, but I still wouldn't call them shallow. Some characters did make the transition better than others though
[8:29:12] <+KingKien> @wintwin33 ppl are just worried that there wont be a true sequel to BB
[8:29:13] <Graveblaze> he's the wolfman
[8:29:15] <ExviusEnvius> cmonBruh pronounce right, man.
[8:29:19] <Onikage234> Yerrr
[8:29:21] <+PeridotLoL> is nezu still in i wanna watch some hibiki
[8:29:23] <micmic112> also they already played the other matches off stream @Mattocat
[8:29:26] <UsernameCrisis> Looking at the bracket. Elyon's out, Azure's out, Betadood's out, SKD's out...
[8:29:29] <+kappacin0> smell;y lul
[8:29:31] <sonicsmashbro97> I love TAG, but I won't sugarcoat the problems it has.
[8:29:31] <+PathEnder> fenlitty PogChamp
[8:29:33] <MayorofMoronMountain> no one cares about their worries watch the damn game
[8:29:34] <WaviDeity> @humbledojo just ignore the hatred dude it's silly
[8:29:35] <+Wintwin33> @kingkien How is that bbtag's fault lol
[8:29:36] <+BossmanPOJO> sadly the BBCF community cant go one stream without the eventual shit on bbtag
[8:29:37] <FG_Ramza> I really want Yutta to win
[8:29:38] <+BadassCyborg3000> Just realized it's the Anime Illuminati B-Squad
[8:29:42] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Avenge your brother, Fenrich doodStare
[8:29:46] <anthraxexe> azure is out too? rip western players
[8:29:46] <schwis_orifice> there will obviously be a true sequel to BB with Xrd graphics tech, someday... maybe in ps5
[8:29:47] <K_ross> hggShaq
[8:29:48] <+Mattocat> I understand, just was hoping to see more players
[8:29:50] <Not_Dragonspenc> no not elyon... evo17Wut evo17Wut
[8:29:50] <Euchre_AFGC> I can't wait to see SKD's OS this time PogChamp
[8:29:50] <Graveblaze> it all goes back to Disgaea 4
[8:29:54] <WaviDeity> the game is not CF just leave it at that chat
[8:29:56] <%Jotamide> Past 3 am in EU, I can't stick around sadly
[8:29:59] <gryffinp> Considering that there's no guilty gear crossover but they're not getting a true sequel to guilty gear I'm not inclined to blame bbtag *ducks8
[8:30:00] <+BadassCyborg3000> Is commentary
[8:30:03] <JackOforGG2020> next bb gonna be a 2 button fighter sajamSegue4
[8:30:03] <Rennovious> All they really need to do is fix Noel and Terumi and we're golden. Bullet I don't really think so because Bullet at least functions as a character while Noel just doesn't.
[8:30:06] <MayorofMoronMountain> chat please tell me your fears about the future I'm on twitch TV cus that's what I want to know
[8:30:09] <humbledojo> @wavideity my main game is smash, i know all about in fighting loool
[8:30:11] <Jyuuken67> its amazing how there can be such amazing matches on screen and twitch chat still finds a way to not be talking about them

[8:30:51] <STenSatsu> lol @mimorinislove . The Dustloop civil war when BBCT came out
[8:30:55] <+PathEnder> it's amazing how people get upset over twitch chat Kappa
[8:31:01] <Powa315> If people are making ggpo for +r, would people be making ggpo for bbcf :thinking:
[8:31:07] <KungFooTitan> I'm team sleeping bag Kappa
[8:31:07] <sonicsmashbro97> TAG will still be my main game. And @Kuribohdudalala yes it did.
[8:31:12] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @PathEnder Oh hey, I know you. LUL doodBro
[8:31:15] <TheHeartsSweet> I'm just waiting for neo
[8:31:16] <definingpurposes> GO FENRICH
[8:31:18] <Jyuuken67> i don't see tochigan winning this easily. fenritti defense and neutral waaay too strong
[8:31:21] <+PathEnder> @Wave_Kusanagi i know you too
[8:31:25] <nope2500> skd osing his loss? @euchre_afgc can you do me a solid and link that to me when he does?
[8:31:30] <shadowswordsman2471> HMMMM, Lust SIN II
[8:31:33] <schwis_orifice> "characters are shallow" BabyRage thinks he will be able to control a full character from either of the franchises in a tag game without changes
[8:31:34] <+Wintwin33> @kingkien What? That's like saying if they kept making MvC we wouldn't get another SF
[8:31:36] <Vashido22> oh hey, the BETTER Lust Sin
[8:31:39] <definingpurposes> SkD lost?
[8:31:41] <Euchre_AFGC> if I remember, and if he does, I will
[8:31:48] <nope2500> sweet thanks
[8:31:51] <+Noctisonyx> Me neither @Jyuuken67 but I gotta side with my Azrael boyo.

[8:32:12] <gryffinp> Is there a bracket up anywhere?
[8:32:13] <UsernameCrisis> @definingpurposes Yeah, he's already out too.
[8:32:14] <+TheRealRedHavoc> Fenritti's opponents shouldn't let him pick Lust Sin II, it makes him to powerful
[8:32:22] <Euchre_AFGC> iirc his OS at Taku was "my controller wasn't broken in" LUL
[8:32:23] <FG_Ramza> +r with GGPO would be sick
[8:32:23] <+Frozen_Lights> my god, what just happened lol
[8:32:27] <tenshinokumo> おふとん ラヴァーズ
[8:32:28] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> fenrich avenging his brother lol
[8:32:30] <Jyuuken67> oof
[8:32:30] <shadowswordsman2471> the theme buff is too strong
[8:32:37] <+Wave_Kusanagi> It's funny, I don't like Jin as a story character at all but like literally everything else about him.
[8:32:41] <thk573> Fenrich's pressure never ceases to amaze me
[8:32:42] <JoshuaVv0> Dude I saw somone streaming CP last week. It blew my mind
[8:32:44] <Not_Dragonspenc> Fenritti is just murdering his opponents
[8:32:47] <CrescentEXE> that throw
[8:32:51] <Powa315> Jin sicc
[8:32:51] <gryffinp> Jin's a shithead but he's got those cuts
[8:32:52] <Graveblaze> give Fenrich an inch...
[8:32:53] <Rennovious> Jin is a great story character though. He's had amazing story development.
[8:32:54] <Vashido22> @fg_ramza someone is working on a caster for it, melty blood style
[8:32:58] <makomako00> あっちゅーま・・・・一人だけ異次元なんだが
[8:32:59] <flerp_fgc> let him play the game fenritti
[8:33:00] <theeasiest1> good lord that was quick
[8:33:01] <lumai42> i love that azrael throw route
[8:33:04] <shadowswordsman2471> i wouldn't say amazing
[8:33:06] <humbledojo> So cp isnt that common i see
[8:33:06] <Euchre_AFGC> @JoshuaVv0 should we do a throwback tournament to CPEX next Aniclash LUL
[8:33:08] <FG_Ramza> @Vashido22 I saw it just now
[8:33:09] <Jyuuken67> fenrich ran away completely that game
[8:33:11] <neuronova> will gg2020 also cause the bbtag affect/syndrome. the anime civil war is near :(
[8:33:16] <nope2500> hehaha so skd is a big time whiner i take it?
[8:33:16] <gryffinp> probably
[8:33:22] <schwis_orifice> jin "i hate my brother because he likes my sister more than me" kisaragi a good character? EleGiggle
[8:33:24] <NanayaFox> that would be godlike
[8:33:26] <humbledojo> It def will @neuronova
[8:33:27] <JoshuaVv0> I don't wanna play CPE thoooooooo
[8:33:29] <FG_Ramza> Its gonna be siiiick
[8:33:30] <Rennovious> I hated Jin when he was all about "Kill my brother hahahaha brother", now hes a better chara.
[8:33:39] <Seph4096> Dont do that Euchre lmao
[8:33:41] <definingpurposes> What about Azrael’s 5A? Wouldn’t that be good for j.2C
[8:33:43] <+dreamyrobot> Yall saw may eat 4 fafnir in gg2020
[8:33:46] <Euchre_AFGC> @nope2500 Not necessarily a "big time whiner" but he does have a history of OS'ing his losses in tournaments
[8:33:47] <+KingKien> @wintwin33 nah those are completely different name brands. with different audiences. I doubt they will simultaneously work on 2 BB games. they have a bunch of other things their doing as well
[8:33:48] <shadowswordsman2471> Jin had ok development in CS, then became kinda static
[8:33:53] <Liransherman> that confirm tho
[8:33:56] <mimorinislove> eventually arcsys games will be so casual they can be compared to smash
[8:33:57] <nope2500> @euchre_afgc i would watch some throwback tourneys
[8:33:58] <+Wave_Kusanagi> I don't agree with that at all and he just either did nothing for me or got on my nerves. I legit only liked him in the final part of CF's story mode and that's it. @schwis_orifice Actually...that's not Jin's whole deal. It seems like it at first, but Jin doesn't actually hate Ragna. It's more complicated than that.
[8:34:01] <Vashido22> Ragna grew one me. Jin is still boneless ky for me lmao
[8:34:13] <+PathEnder> jin is at his best when he wants to kill ragna or talking about justice
[8:34:19] <FG_Ramza> I've never played BB's story so idk what the heck yall are saying LOL
[8:34:22] <Euchre_AFGC> "if fenrich went in overdrive, it'll kill" it doesnt kill lmfao
[8:34:22] <spikycactus> Jin becomes a lot more like Hakumen at the end of CF
[8:34:22] <schwis_orifice> unga
[8:34:24] <gryffinp> That pixel is sorcerous
[8:34:25] <thk573> NICE COMEBACK

[8:43:39] <STenSatsu> DESTROYED by RIBS and BITS
[8:43:45] <sibladeKO> i bet if izanami looked like arakune a lot more people would whine
[8:43:48] <HyoyeonZero> @54muestrasderespeto es una estupidez de personaje es todo lo que te dire xd
[8:43:48] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Izanami is great. <3
[8:43:49] <sidexblaze> izanamiiiiii
[8:43:50] <54muestrasderespeto> @Euchre_AFGC @HyoyeonZero @micmic112 "Oh~"
[8:43:50] <+MatasoFGC> @Jyuuken67 Agreed Izanami is probably the best case of ArcSys balance
[8:43:54] <ChemicalChocobo> bang needs more nails
[8:43:59] <gryffinp> Someone asked if Jin was blazblue's bad guy, if you're still here: THAT is the bad guy
[8:43:59] <+PeridotLoL> Ppl talking about ribs and tits but its really about those legs
[8:44:04] <PegAsi_Aviation> why do people hate izanami ?
[8:44:06] <Euchre_AFGC> Mataso is trolling @Skargust
[8:44:06] <KevAb> We need more Izanami's so more people can complain how awful is her to the game
[8:44:09] <schwis_orifice> @S0nFr0st snitch LUL
[8:44:12] <noorejji> what are guys talking about izanami is trash
[8:44:14] <nope2500> soooooo who do you all hate more izanami or arakune?
[8:44:15] <shadowswordsman2471> cause of ribcage
[8:44:16] <Rennovious> If you think about who Izanami is and what she's supposed to do she's one of the best executed characters ever. She's the final boss, of course she's supposed to make you mad.
[8:44:17] <54muestrasderespeto> Seems like a fun character Keepo
[8:44:18] <STenSatsu> Dora's a man who played Bang in CT. I'm sure he doesn't mind fighting op shit lol
[8:44:18] <Not_Dragonspenc> Izanami is the bad guy?
[8:44:19] <iofleming2> izanami is hot
[8:44:23] <+KingKien> what's the most balanced Arksys game? I think it's CF tbh
[8:44:24] <thk573> @nope2500 Arakune
[8:44:26] <ValkyrieKoji> ^^^
[8:44:27] <Graveblaze> Bang needs more calcium to keep up
[8:44:27] <Jyuuken67> lmfaoo izanami did nothing wrong
[8:44:28] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @sibladeKO People would cry if anyone looked like Arakune, dude LUL
[8:44:31] <XBloom_> Blazblue CentralFiction is a game for bad boys and girls
[8:44:33] <+MatasoFGC> I'm not trolling I love Izanami
[8:44:33] <XtemmA> @peridotlol SeemsGood
[8:44:34] <NA_ohh> ST akuma
[8:44:39] <STenSatsu> CSEX is probably the most balanced
[8:44:40] <+aWastedNinja> welp
[8:44:41] <+bittahjuri> Izanami is a case study of bbplayers being unable to block
[8:44:42] <K_ross> Izanami is one input I AM THE NEUTRAL
[8:44:43] <kokujin_> speaking of arakune, is souji still in
[8:44:45] <Liransherman> Ribcage boys
[8:44:48] <TigerClaws12> this character
[8:44:48] <alexprice> izanami propagandists WutFace
[8:44:50] <ValkyrieKoji> izanami muh nubian queen
[8:44:50] <neuronova> arakune is the ryu of bb, duh
[8:44:51] <Jyuuken67> she's so stylish and i genuinely love the characters aesthetic and tools
[8:44:52] <boostingwarlord> ribcage is for scrubs
[8:44:53] <Vashido22> fucking ribcage
[8:44:55] <iofleming2> yomotsuhirasaka so good
[8:45:02] <AzmoFGC> mataso how many times are we gonna have to teach you this lesson old man
[8:45:02] <schwis_orifice> izanami is still a cool character. ribcage doesnt come without its drawbacks. people just love whining :)
[8:45:08] <Seph4096> I also <3 Izanami
[8:45:11] <Jyuuken67> fighting her and playing her is mad fun and her theme is OD
[8:45:13] <TagAnarchy> Yeah, were it not for how annoying ribcage is, Izanami would be perfectly fine.
[8:45:18] <shadowswordsman2471> yeah, Izanami is super cool, it's just that she is REALLY overwhelming at high level play
[8:45:18] <makomako00> あ、ていうかもう日本人しか残ってないのか
[8:45:29] <albedo58> Izanami is probably one of the hardest characters to play. You are oversimplifying how good ribcage is
[8:45:30] <ValkyrieKoji> get rid of cage, but be able to block in exodus
[8:45:30] <@Nightbot> @S0nFr0st -> Sometimes you scare me! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[8:45:32] <PVL_93_RU> Chat's full of degenerates atpCap
[8:45:33] <gryffinp> Best command throw
[8:45:38] <+Wave_Kusanagi> People who whine about Izanami in BB probably also whine about Elphelt in GG. lytSMUG
[8:45:40] <Rennovious> >Hardest characters to play No, no she really isn't
[8:45:44] <Lvl100_Charizard> Izanami isn't that good, just block 4Head
[8:45:45] <HyoyeonZero> like she's a pretty dificult character to play
[8:45:48] <shadowswordsman2471> she is though :v
[8:45:52] <ValkyrieKoji> and give her a DP
[8:45:54] <+bittahjuri> Ribcage is hard to optimize
[8:45:54] <PosingWhale> lets goo
[8:45:55] <Alex_Eight> when is BBTAG?
[8:45:55] <iofleming2> execution wise?

[8:45:58] <tenshinokumo> いつ外人いると錯覚した？
[8:45:59] <+PeridotLoL> Pretty sure Naoto supposed to be hardest char
[8:46:02] <pressingbuttonsonwakeup> she's not THE hardest but she is at least one of the harder ones
[8:46:07] <schwis_orifice> one of the hardest he said...
[8:46:09] <Euchre_AFGC> most of the top tier characters are hard to play in bbcf and no @PeridotLoL he's not
[8:46:09] <Jyuuken67> yea there are answers to ribcage. dora actually has been playing around it extremely well. he's been getting caught a lot in air to air situations
[8:46:10] <TagAnarchy> Naoto is a wrist breaker
[8:46:12] <Myoverworld> how yall know about this game do people play it in the USA Kappa
[8:46:13] <Rennovious> I wouldn't put Izanami anywhere close to people like Rachel, Carl or Naoto in terms of Execution
[8:46:17] <KevAb> It's not how strong her pressure is, it's how easy she corner carries from anything and how she can skip neutral with 1 input and a button.
[8:46:24] <neuronova> who has the highest skill ceiling? Rachel?
[8:46:27] <kuncles> Wow Bang is fun to watch
[8:46:29] <Euchre_AFGC> @schwis_orifice are you gonna sit here and say that Izanami isn't hard to play? lol
[8:46:30] <HyoyeonZero> Naoto is dificult because of microdashes
[8:46:33] <+Frozen_Lights> DORA?
[8:46:34] <Liransherman> that backdash
[8:46:36] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @neuronova Carl.
[8:46:36] <ValkyrieKoji> its only hard if you dont main them
[8:46:38] <NA_ohh> Dominican bang
[8:46:38] <nope2500> ive heard that rachel and carl are tied for hardest
[8:46:40] <+aWastedNinja> DORA PLEASE
[8:46:45] <S0nFr0st> @Euchre_AFGC Who would you saya is the hardest character to play?
[8:46:48] <+PeridotLoL> @Euchre_AFGC sry I'm not too sure about different char difficulties all I know is Naoto destroys your hands
[8:46:55] <schwis_orifice> @Euchre_AFGC i know shes hard, that was aimed at the guy who said "lol she isnt THE hardest"
[8:46:57] <Euchre_AFGC> most of the top tier characters have ridiculous execution gates
[8:46:59] <HyoyeonZero> Rachel's wind mecanic makes timing a very important thing
[8:46:59] <ValkyrieKoji> ASTRAL
[8:47:02] <+aWastedNinja> YES
[8:47:03] <theeasiest1> eyy
[8:47:05] <PosingWhale> yessss
[8:47:05] <Not_Dragonspenc> Did she just summon a dinosaur
[8:47:07] <Jyuuken67> dora's answers to ribcage neutral are soooo good

[8:47:12] <noorejji> is this… happening?
[8:47:14] <neuronova> @wave_kusanagi really carl dosen't feel that bad once you get used to the multitasking?
[8:47:17] <humbledojo> We have a match

[8:47:21] <pow2009> rooPog rooPog rooPog
[8:47:21] <UsernameCrisis> DORA! DORA!
[8:47:23] <TagAnarchy> Izanami is hard to play, but not so hard that it negates ribcage being annoying
[8:47:24] <Graveblaze> agumon makes an appearance
[8:47:24] <Rennovious> Yo Dora tho???????
[8:47:27] <micmic112> Dora is still one of the best players
[8:47:28] <PepyakoMan> waiting for another wakeup astral 4Head
[8:47:28] <ScorchingStocking> JUST BELIEVE JUSTICE
[8:47:29] <makomako00> バリア回復待ってたが、知ってたドラさん
[8:47:31] <+Aerodat> I love how there's 4.1k people watching this game but not even a tenth of that will play it
[8:47:32] <HyoyeonZero> He's harder than Relius that's for sure
[8:47:34] <nope2500> @peridotlol naotos difficulty is an over exagerated meme
[8:47:34] <gryffinp> God those fucking raw drives hits
[8:47:38] <NA_ohh> carl isnt hard if you ignore the hard part of him
[8:47:41] <+Ketsumi> ashuPog
[8:47:44] <Euchre_AFGC> @S0nFr0st probably Carl because you're playing 2 characters at once, but I can't really speak to anyone besides Hazama. I only know most characters by proxy
[8:47:44] <theeasiest1> bang that izanami dora the explora
[8:47:45] <%Bucksamazing> Bucksamazing subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[8:47:47] <tenshinokumo> おお
[8:47:51] <Jyuuken67> @Aerodat i was thinking that lol
[8:47:58] <micmic112> YMST is definitely the favorite in this match but dora can still win
[8:48:03] <shadowswordsman2471> come on dora, save us from the iza rampage
[8:48:05] <Euchre_AFGC> @Bucksamazing BLACK HANZO OUT HERE ABOUT TO MAKE WILD TWITTER POSTS
[8:48:07] <+aWastedNinja> I was on netplay earlier and saw like 14 people LMAO
[8:48:08] <%Bucksamazing> monster is my boy
[8:48:08] <NanayaFox> @aerodat exactly
[8:48:11] <Jyuuken67> carl isn't hard if you play him for 10 years
[8:48:11] <Myoverworld> agreed Im surprised the community is pretty lively in chat only if the online was good Kappa
[8:48:13] <+TeeJayVA> I played BB from CT to CP. Just too many games and too little time
[8:48:15] <humbledojo> I love me some set play
[8:48:28] <nope2500> hot take.... rachel combos are harder than naoto combos
[8:48:31] <%Bucksamazing> nigga who is black hanzo
[8:48:34] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @neuronova Not really. Getting used to the timing and being able to pull it off consistently whiel also being flexible and reading many moves ahead of other opponents are two different things. There's a reason why there's only like 2 or 3 Carls but they're all monsters.
[8:48:34] <Seph4096> I'd say Carl, but i have heard that for some ppl Litchi is harder, or Rachel
[8:48:36] <TagAnarchy> Did they ever finish that GGPO mod for CF? I want to give it a try.
[8:48:37] <micmic112> too bad monster is playing my boy Masa, definitely gonna root for best mai player

[8:49:22] <Rennovious> JP population is still healthy. They've had 2 Braver's Revel tournaments this month.
[8:49:27] <Myoverworld> bring back team battles
[8:49:28] <Jyuuken67> dora really losing because of neutral callouts. he hasn't had an izanami round yet
[8:49:28] <+bittahjuri> and i'm Chickzama
[8:49:28] <+tattersail> @Aerodat Its hard for people to care about a franchise that seems to be dead. BBTag is the new "BB" game. Who knows when another real BlazBlue game will come out

[8:49:41] <+TeeJayVA> BB has always been fairly popular in Japan iirc. At least in arcades
[8:49:42] <HyoyeonZero> Litchi is not that hard tbh, her staff can difficult sometimes but not carl or izanami levels

[8:57:32] <+TheBlackHylian> Mai's a girl. Y'all working too hard to be weird in chat lmao.
[8:57:33] <gryffinp> All of this is irrelevant because Mai is not Litchi
[8:57:33] <+Wave_Kusanagi> It's funny, I feel like Mai bein so pretty and appeal comes from the fact that she's basically Dizzy and Bridget fused into one character. LUL

[9:03:06] <jjbx22> Skd still in losers?/?
[9:03:07] <+Wave_Kusanagi> No, Kokonoe makes it clear that she's been around for a long time. Hence her "If I had it, they be at the floor" comment about her tits
[9:03:10] <&ANIMEILLUMINATI> Guymam moved back to SoCal to chase a professional commentary career
[9:03:12] <schwis_orifice> yes, both gg and crosstag are today as well. its going to run very late...

[9:03:30] <+aWastedNinja> after we play Tekken 3 Mataso
[9:03:34] <thk573> @boostingwarlord She's not. The grimoire changed her physically and mentally. She's 100% a girl now
[9:03:37] <Bloo561> Tochigin vs Nezu offstream
[9:03:42] <+MatasoFGC> Bruh my Bryan is nice is Tekken 3

[9:04:12] <+Wave_Kusanagi> If Naoto loses as Rachel, I hope he switches to Naoto
[9:04:12] <Not_Dragonspenc> Button check in 2019
[9:04:14] <+PeridotLoL> Fame lost in pools
[9:04:15] <NinaGoemod> The grimoire never affected her mentally. It only changed her body. Mai is a woman because she's a woman.
[9:04:17] <boostingwarlord> @thk573 Bro i played the story, and ur interpretation is cool. Ur entitled to ur opinion but my opinion is that mai is a really thicc man pls respect that.
[9:04:18] <K_ross> No usa
[9:04:20] <%Bucksamazing> fame got arrested
[9:04:21] <Myoverworld> whats the lore on this other boobie lady did she have a dong

[9:04:48] <FG_Ramza> Dora is out
[9:04:53] <iofleming2> litchi dumb
[9:04:53] <thk573> @boostingwarlord Uh... it's not my opinion. She stated in canon (in the Variable Heart manga) that she's become a girl mentally as well.
[9:04:59] <schwis_orifice> whats the lore on why rachel stopped growing up?
[9:04:59] <NightKillerX123> 👀

[9:05:15] <Showbiz54> this is why arcs making games easier :( (jk lol)
[9:05:17] <kentokiog> Accepting the dissonance of her physical body and gender identity. AKA the genderbend. Its her whole character. To not be forced, the genderbend would be secondary
[9:05:18] <boostingwarlord> @thk573 Thats cool. So that means he is a really thicc man who thinks hes a girl now?
[9:05:19] <schwis_orifice> so she wasnt born a vampire? i mean dad is a vampire.

[9:05:48] <micmic112> souji is in losers top 8
[9:05:49] <neuronova> arakune <3 <3
[9:05:50] <boostingwarlord> i dont see a difference between mai and amane
[9:05:52] <pink_is_fine> damn right
[9:05:56] <sibladeKO> you missed earlier
[9:05:58] <+bittahjuri> @Euchre_AFGC is that the #1 Hazama player in the US
[9:06:01] <$GF202020> I still find it fucked up though that the NoName changed Mai without consent.
[9:06:04] <lumai42> they were playing naoto last set
[9:06:05] <+PeridotLoL> naoto not playing naoto DansGame
[9:06:05] <nope2500> naoto was playing naoto earlier
[9:06:06] <Jyuuken67> fumi is checking naoto HARD
[9:06:06] <DiZ17> poor george lol
[9:06:06] <Bloo561> Souji beats Dora_Bang to get into Top 8
[9:06:07] <gryffinp> If you're surprised that the japanese are dominating a blazblue tourney then you are not paying attention
[9:06:14] <UsernameCrisis> @iofleming2 he does have a naoto, as seen earlier
[9:06:14] <Not_Dragonspenc> Send in the frogs KomodoHype KomodoHype
[9:06:18] <sibladeKO> he played naoto vs another rachel
[9:06:22] <+Wave_Kusanagi> Amane is just a really pretty guy that does kabuki theater. LUL
[9:06:27] <boostingwarlord> HOLD THE NEUTRAL FROG
[9:06:27] <%Bucksamazing> this ass bust
[9:06:27] <+StalwartSoul> @wave_kusanagi do you have links for it? On mobile rn, last one I read was Bloodedge Experience because Naoto fanboy
[9:06:30] <gryffinp> If I ignore the stage I can pretend I'm watching calamity trigger
[9:06:31] <iofleming2> @usernamecrisis why he switch
[9:06:32] <johnyoly420> Amane is cool
[9:06:34] <lumai42> of course the naoto player would pick raquel though
[9:06:35] <NinaGoemod> No Name changed Mai because Mai was always a woman. That's the point. Mai was always Mai.
[9:06:36] <thk573> Mai is a girl in both body and mind. Amane's just a very feminine looking man. (And yes, mai has the body of a woman. The grimoire changed her gender 'cause it can only be wielded by a female)
[9:06:43] <XtemmA> if at least one people liked it, the design is working as intended

[9:07:38] <nope2500> suprised no its a fighting game if it ismt domminated by japanese or korean players the tournament is barely worth watching at all..... just dissapointed that there arent non jp players left

[9:08:02] <yaminegira13> does pakistan have any BB players?

[9:08:24] <johnyoly420> LOL TAGER
[9:08:24] <+robobaghdaddy> anime is punishable by stoning in pakistan
[9:08:26] <nope2500> tekken isnt a game.... its art...... and thus the exception @euchre_afgc
[9:08:33] <TannoAlone> Tekken is dominant to Pakistan. Nothing else.
[9:08:37] <boostingwarlord> Tager is just like a really thicc girl
[9:08:49] <sangi53> ppsst TransgenderPride
[9:08:52] <GerardJS84> @robobaghdaddy Oh boy. I love to be stoned. Kappa
[9:08:54] <schwis_orifice> you get lynched if you watch anime in pakistan
[9:08:57] <sibladeKO> boosting still typing when he got tired of paragraphs
[9:08:58] <johnyoly420> Tager is more thicc than Nine and Mai
[9:08:59] <boostingwarlord> so thicc that she lost her genitals and now only has muscle. thx mori we really need it
[9:09:01] <rkblitz> you forgot KOF
[9:09:02] <火災の炎> rachel looks like one of those characters you just hate to play against
[9:09:11] <gryffinp> Accurate.
[9:09:12] <FG_Ramza> Arslan, Awais Honey and Atif Butt are sick players
[9:09:13] <lumai42> is there something that influences what tempest dhalila spawns or is it random?
[9:09:20] <+Gruff757> Izrael has the biggest tits
[9:09:22] <Euchre_AFGC> @火災の炎 you are correct sir
[9:09:32] <HyoyeonZero> i think its the amount of wind meter
[9:09:33] <TannoAlone> I agree. Arslan is the best Tekken player out there.
[9:09:34] <neuronova> tager aint a boi PunOko he a bot MrDestructoid
[9:09:34] <+6000j> saying that kr/jp is the best at all FGs implies that Terraria PvP isn't a FG which is blasphemy Kappa
[9:09:37] <OpposeArt> Virtua fighter best boomer game annytfCool
[9:09:37] <Skargust> Tempest Dhalia depends on Rachel's wind meter p. sure
[9:09:38] <johnyoly420> I hate fighting Rachel, but I do enjoy watching her
[9:09:39] <boostingwarlord> ok yall prob gonna hate me for pointing this out. But rachel is a boy. like actually search it up. He just dresses like that cuz her father wanted a girl
[9:09:39] <demisouls> what a scrambly fight
[9:09:40] <+Gruff757> Azrael*
[9:09:41] <lumai42> ah i see
[9:09:49] <+PeridotLoL> Nezu lost FeelsBadMan
[9:09:50] <Mimeblade> Rachel needs to be used in BBTAG more tho, she's fun to watch
[9:09:52] <schwis_orifice> @boostingwarlord d:
[9:09:53] <nope2500> people over here saying tager is a better waifu than the girls... acter seeing maid tager id have to agree
[9:09:53] <Powa315> I can't believe that
[9:09:54] <FG_Ramza> I think Awais Honey is better but Arslan is quite good
[9:09:54] <TannoAlone> He outplayed even the Tekken monsters, like Qudans, HolyKnee, etc.
[9:09:54] <Not_Dragonspenc> Big chair for small girl
[9:09:56] <+OgGeek2016> Do you guys not know that Japan plays BBCF just about every day??
[9:10:01] <+Wave_Kusanagi> @lumai42 Pretty sure it's random. @Gruff757 Susanoo's are bigger
[9:10:05] <NinaGoemod> y'all can just shut up now
[9:10:06] <+StalwartSoul> y'all jelly on Jubei because he had sex with a hot witch 4Head dont @ me
[9:10:06] <boostingwarlord> bro yall need to respect tager as a woman
[9:10:08] <albedo58> Arslan is not the best, even other players from Pakistan agree
[9:10:11] <XtemmA> Tager is a proud lesbian. much respect PrideWingR
[9:10:11] <火災の炎> instant overheads and the zoning + poison damage just seems awful

[9:10:26] <boostingwarlord> @XtemmA PREACH DAWG
[9:10:33] <albedo58> Players like Atif Butt and Awais Honey have better results, and probably even they aren't the best
[9:10:43] <Rupture_EX> Tager its a proud Attack Helicopter

[9:11:05] <FG_Ramza> @albedo58 I think Awais is the best easily
[9:11:14] <Not_Dragonspenc> Look at that frog going in
[9:11:18] <Sheraldford> @Rupture_EX FINALLY someone gets it right. There is a reason he can fly.
[9:11:34] <albedo58> I think Atif might be better, the problem is that all these guys are using Akuma. I want to see other characters
[9:11:38] <sibladeKO> that's still a somewhat small sample size i sort of want to see if people learn to counterplay them @albedo58
[9:11:41] <gryffinp> God I'd love to see some fucking iron tager today
[9:11:54] <FG_Ramza> True, which is why I like Arslan play Kazumi

[9:54:39] <schwis_orifice> @DrCheesesteak LOL SFV has declining tourney registrations over the years. that has remained consistent. SFV also hasn't sold nearly as much as SF4 because it's not as old.

[9:57:17] <+CottonSC> Damn Kedako making this look easy, there really aren't any US Mays
[9:57:17] <gryffinp> the only way for a fighting game to gain players is to bring in characters that the broadest possible audience knows
[9:57:19] <STenSatsu> the classic May approach
[9:57:20] <+PathEnder> there's about 5000 pedos in this chat right Kappa
[9:57:22] <schwis_orifice> @whinemale they will still leave after getting destroyed online and realizing there's no more content outside fighting.
[9:57:23] <jeejington_tv> @schwis_orifice I will say its one of the lesser known titles nowadays though its been around for a long time

[9:57:48] <STenSatsu> wtf that j.k hitbox
[9:57:48] <+DrCheesesteak> tbh, there are multiple layers as to why FGs either don't sell well or dont have high player retention, etc.

[9:58:09] <+stealthblazer> @schwis_orifice you have a point but take it like this. If they see how hard the game is, they won't stick cuz it's too difficult
[9:58:10] <+DrCheesesteak> maybe if it was a team game...imagine 3v3 in FGs where everyone is active at all times PogChamp but not like Smash... FUNgineer
[9:58:14] <JackOforGG2020> that corner combos would've reset to neutral after 4 hits in 2020 sajamSegue4

[10:05:03] <nepotato> cus its no nut november
[10:05:05] <powerburial> instead of simplifying systems, devs should focus on good training and tutorial options, and an interesting story mode to draw in people who think the characters are cool

[11:10:32] <schwis_orifice> @ProsecutorYayoi yes, ive seen old pictures of bace in NLBC
[11:10:34] <HanDaimond> @metalwolf_mx People offended in 2019? WHAT ARE THE ODDS

[11:11:01] <Overhaul180> @uber_cuck_master You’re right she’s probably an expert instead of just pretty good
[11:11:02] <Vashido22> @Lionhart16 that one needs meter, doesn't depend on the lvl
[11:11:04] <TheCruelReality> annytfPop
[11:11:12] <Andronious88> Much as i hate Yuzu Mitsu im still for Bace
[11:11:17] <uber_cuck_master> But I gotta give it to both these dudes they are pretty badass
[11:11:22] <metalwolf_mx> im not ofended at all, but some people are being really harsh, whit bace
[11:11:22] <+Cheepsuits> cmonBruh
[11:11:25] <+TNine227> bace setups are just too strong
[11:11:43] <+Lionhart16> @vashido22 Ah, okay. Wasn't sure if the element bar changes that or not.
[11:11:45] <Andronious88> Shes showing good awareness with the Seth balls too

[11:12:00] <Overhaul180> @uber_cuck_master I agree, and also good on you for using a non-gendered term like dudes, that’s very progressive of you :}

[11:12:44] <minicilp13> Personally I pair him with weiss and the two go somewhat well together
[11:12:55] <Andronious88> Mitsu is gettin nerfed next patch, so well see on the future of her play
[11:12:57] <+makoe_> !bracket
[11:12:57] <@Nightbot> Brackets here: https://smash.gg/tournament/arcrevo-america-2019/events
[11:13:12] <metalwolf_mx> lets go blades
[11:13:17] <K_ross> Mitsu has no confirmed nerfs
[11:13:22] <LaowPing> Mitsuru is a slap on the wrist lol. She'll still be top tier
[11:13:24] <Andronious88> Then again, the era of Susie is coming monkaS
[11:13:34] <+Lionhart16> Also, did Seth have something similar to that Command Grab super in UNIST? Because that seems pretty powerful considering the type if character he is.
[11:13:36] <+CharlestonJew> the era of Blitztank is coming
[11:13:43] <K_ross> @lionhart16 Nope
[11:13:48] <schwis_orifice> mitsuru is not allowed to be anything less than top tier in any of the games shes in. the Kirijo group wont allow it.
[11:13:50] <WTFTreeman> this confirm monkaS
[11:13:50] <LaowPing> Seth has that command grab in unist without spending meter if he wanted
[11:13:50] <solidoutlaw> he has a command grab special and super in unib
[11:13:51] <shu_plays_kusoge> F
[11:13:54] <nedokius03> misturu takes INASNe execution, shes allowed to be OP. atleast in UNIEL anyways
[11:13:55] <2YearOldEnglishGirl> nah. his command grabhas the shittiest range
[11:13:59] <minicilp13> the era of tank gang is coming
[11:13:59] <+Cheepsuits> seth in unist WutFace
[11:14:07] <LemmiSlams> @Lionhart16 That Command Grab super is a BBTAG original
[11:14:10] <solidoutlaw> and he can combo off the super version
[11:14:11] <Mystletaynn> f
[11:14:12] <WilliamIV> good set
[11:14:14] <NinaGoemod> Go Bace!

[11:14:15] <ProsecutorYayoi> f
[11:14:15] <schwis_orifice> @Lionhart16 seth is arguably the strongest character in unist

[11:14:34] <rolanddegil> gg2020 should be on other channel now
[11:14:34] <Zeno3656> that was a good set
[11:14:36] <+Critical_Hitta_> bace got long ass arms
[11:14:38] <Vashido22> @Lionhart16 he has a command grab special in unist, but he needs resources to combo from it. It doesn't have invul, but still really strong
[11:14:40] <metalwolf_mx> Man... I wanted blades to win...

[11:32:31] <2YearOldEnglishGirl> RWBY is good because it inadvertently exposed people to Undernight.
[11:32:37] <+CharlestonJew> is it really a dub if thats the original voice
[11:32:44] <+LordJebu5> Yang Gang

[11:49:40] <SciurusAlpha> I KNEW IT!
[11:49:43] <Your_ally> 9 frame dash
[11:49:46] <NinaGoemod> she's actually a shrine maiden

[11:49:52] <crazyape6554__> RPGAyaya
[11:49:53] <powerburial> can someone in chat explain the resonance system? i dont want to interrupt the great matches to google it Kappa
[11:50:02] <maron0168> フェン氏行け〰〰❗❗
[11:50:02] <lumai42> nice tech moopokNervoushab
[11:50:07] <+TNine227> gotta burn the meter on the last one to make the slashes safe
[11:50:09] <Silverfox094> they literally worship the sword she uses
[11:50:14] <MegaMeister> SONIC PUNCH
[11:50:18] <BobTheSheriff> basically you spend resonance to enter resonance mode which uses up your resonance
[11:50:21] <leon619dfa> @powerburial google it koefAyaya
[11:50:31] <powerburial> what does resonance mode entail?
[11:50:32] <+CharlestonJew> @powerburial doing assists and stuff fills up those 4 blue squares on the bottom, that powers up your resonance you can use when 1 character dies
[11:50:35] <CrimsonBrave> @powerburial the more you use your assists and system mechanics the stronger your not x factor becomes
[11:50:36] <MegaMeister> aka REBELLION SPEAR
[11:50:43] <Dragonmassag77> Damn let Fenrich play LUL
[11:50:51] <jiggitygee> kyamei is playing fucking absurdly well
[11:50:51] <+coreY_2293> monkaS
[11:50:52] <Drakogy> yabba dabba doo
[11:50:53] <NinaGoemod> @powerburial when you assist, the resonance level goes up. When your character dies you get 15 seconds of meter gain and health gain and can cancel moves into supers
[11:50:53] <gabp11> resonance level goes up from 1 to 4 the more you use partner mechanic
[11:51:03] <SciurusAlpha> Anyone ever saw him on his p h o n e
[11:51:09] <powerburial> ok thank you everyone :~)
[11:51:11] <MegaMeister> Kyamei should have played Marvel 3
[11:51:13] <CrimsonBrave> you also getad chip on everything
[11:51:22] <jayromulus> kyamei, fenrich spent a lot of money on his stick please let him use it
[11:51:25] <SciurusAlpha> HIS ON HIS PHONE!!! YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooo
[11:51:25] <maron0168> フェン氏負けるな〰〰❗❗
[11:51:25] <+CharlestonJew> goddamn
[11:51:27] <Dragonmassag77> That Fucking candy a Hype Drug LUL
[11:51:28] <+RoyalCerezav2> I wanna get good at bbtag.. but I dont even get how to start LOL
[11:51:37] <BobTheSheriff> you get good by playing
[11:51:44] <+concept_5> !BRACKET
[11:51:44] <@Nightbot> Brackets here: https://smash.gg/tournament/arcrevo-america-2019/events
[11:51:46] <LaowPing> Did Yuzu assist get hit or something?
[11:51:46] <micmic112> it's okay @RoyalCerezav2 hilda is coming
[11:51:48] <jiggitygee> uhhh do the tutorial and mission mode it goes fairly in depth
[11:51:50] <+Dabessbeast> bbtag is easy to get into
[11:51:53] <Mystletaynn> the game has a tutorial tactics mode
[11:52:00] <+TeaDubz> Whats on Kyamei's Phone lool
[11:52:03] <+kneesocks_fgc> new teddie item in 2.0 ltls phone
[11:52:09] <+CharlestonJew> the best way to start is to just play some matches
[11:52:12] <IAmKasaii> @powerburial something to add, there are some assist tech that will make your character glow blue, this will make resonance fill up faster when you assist
[11:52:15] <mimorinislove> play > watch match vids > training > repeat
[11:52:19] <jiggitygee> then just find a team you like and play em, dont worry about team composition if you just wanna have fun
[11:52:28] <Omalymaster> You get good by slobbering all over yuzu’s toes
[11:52:33] <plastic_mac09> ^^^^
[11:52:34] <Ph4ntom900> If this game had Cell, it would be a different story...
[11:52:35] <+RoyalCerezav2> I mean I wanna take this game competitively like I do uni
[11:52:35] <powerburial> interesting, appreciate the extra detail. this stage background is so good (i have to combine these comments cuz slow mode)
[11:52:39] <micmic112> Kyamei's phone says "Believe in the Protein and it will never fail you"
[11:52:41] <+CharlestonJew> if that were true I'd be the best BBTAG player on earth
[11:52:45] <Gwyn_1927> UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGHH english voices, bye
[11:52:46] <BobTheSheriff> yuzu dub is kinda eh tho
[11:52:51] <pplcallmesinbad> ^
[11:52:56] <sals5> why are they using eng voices eww
[11:53:03] <+RoyalCerezav2> like...I just suck at team games lmao
[11:53:11] <pplcallmesinbad> backdashes don't sound so good in eng dub
[11:53:13] <BobTheSheriff> play gg then Kappa
[11:53:14] <TagAnarchy> because there's nothing wrong with the eng voices?
[11:53:20] <K_ross> Yuzu’s ain’t too bad

[11:53:33] <+0Kog0> @MagnetsFGC Pog
[11:53:34] <CrimsonBrave> i mean everyone sucks at team games at first. they are uniquely chaotic lol
[11:53:34] <pplcallmesinbad> eng dub is very good
[11:53:39] <jiggitygee> erica lindbeck's nice idk what yall talkin bout
[11:53:40] <plastic_mac09> If it's a team game thing just watch people play and notice everytime they use assists in neutral and think of why it might be good/try it yourself
[11:53:44] <+CharlestonJew> people hate eng voices cuz they don't like listening to women talk, they just like the squeaky foreign sounds
[11:53:45] <+Jos1816> I like the dub for this game
[11:53:47] <micmic112> it's Deb PogChamp
[11:53:53] <Silverfox094> there is some really good Voice actors doing the dub in bbtag
[11:53:55] <pplcallmesinbad> but yuzu's kowai kowai only sounds good in jp
[11:54:00] <+Lucky_C> Yuzu's butchers her character IMO shes completely different in english
[11:54:00] <+hotshotqq> anime players dont have neuch

[11:54:15] <jiggitygee> a lot of stuff does get lost in translation but really what can you do thats just how dubs go
[11:54:19] <pplcallmesinbad> real men don't block
[11:54:20] <Silverfox094> Wait she is the same actually
