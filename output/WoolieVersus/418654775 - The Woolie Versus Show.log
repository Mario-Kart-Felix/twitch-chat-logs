[0:19:36] <%jinking79> Xbox one still waiting on the patch to drop
[0:19:42] <T_Sasquatch> fuck yea, add a lot of variations and never be able to use them in ranked PogChamp
[0:19:44] <hassanico> Injustice 2
[0:19:52] <%linkwolf4> cuz it wasn't balanced for SHIT
[0:19:54] <+chubbypencil> @fFailureatlife he is just the biggest jobber in the story
[0:20:00] <+RedMageRebel> as a casual I love the variations 🤷♂️
[0:20:10] <%jinking79> pc user slow dropping
[0:20:13] <T_Sasquatch> i know but why bother to even include all that work into it
[0:20:19] <Theworld732> Netherrealm said they’re looking into making custom tournament viable
[0:20:30] <ArbyDMC> There's at least a versus mode option that only uses tournament presets.
[0:20:34] <+NarcissistCactus> gotta get the kasuals
[0:20:36] <%fFailureatlife> aren't most tourney players pushing for custom variations
[0:20:38] <mankeyfigh> @woolieversus you could just touch a button and it turn it off in Smash tho
[0:20:51] <T_Sasquatch> realistically it will never be in a tournament because it is IMPOSSIBLE to train for
[0:20:52] <NumberTooBig> look man, Netherealm has a LOT of money they gotta spend, they gotta spend it somehow
[0:20:54] <ScreamingMeat> @chubbypencil Kotal? Yeah he gets it SUPER hard!
[0:20:58] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm still sitting here asking how Misery Blade is in neither of Scorpion's tournament variations.
[0:21:02] <Theworld732> There are no stats online
[0:21:03] <hassanico> Check the tutorial for a bit!
[0:21:04] <zk_nails> Having fun DansGame
[0:21:06] <%fFailureatlife> augments dont work for online battles
[0:21:09] <hassanico> You get Frame Data!
[0:21:13] <%fFailureatlife> only ai and single player
[0:21:37] <%wujak> you can go to fight, tournament and play with only those variations. you only have to do this to get it in training and other modes. online ranked is also tourney variations only
[0:21:57] <hassanico> Feels like Kotal has way less sun stuff in this game
[0:21:57] <@Menitta> It sucks because Cassie has a Urien tackle in neither default variation
[0:22:04] <+LastHazzerd> the tournament scene for this game is ginna be.... eh....
[0:22:04] <+chubbypencil> having the preset 2 not be tourny legal is weird
[0:22:05] <+dramajoe> this game has got the best frame data tutorial.
[0:22:13] <%Solidnick18> ehhh
[0:22:23] <+RedMageRebel> oh that's a cool loading screen I haven't seen that yet
[0:22:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:34] <ScreamingMeat> It's so weird to me that Sub-Zero makes ice axes in this game. I'm used tothe ice sword
[0:22:35] <ArbyDMC> NRS are the only devs I know that include the frame data.
[0:22:55] <+DeathGodSkeith> dead or alive also does
[0:23:05] <+NarcissistCactus> street fighter 5
[0:23:22] <+DeathGodSkeith> ya AE added it
[0:23:28] <alexandrecau> nerfed kotal to be more jobby
[0:23:33] <+LastHazzerd> cuz you either have fun with moves that aren't tourny legal or not and play ariund to avoid bad habbits
[0:23:37] <mankeyfigh> Huh?
[0:23:42] <ELJOVENBATALI> Kotal is just mexican woolie and I'm here for it
[0:23:58] <%Afterman_> Afterman_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:24:01] <JayEarly> @woolieversus You might want to go into controls and disable negative edge
[0:24:16] <mistersups> Killer Instict also includes FrameData
[0:24:17] <ScreamingMeat> Wait did the remove permanent bloodstaining and battle damage?
[0:24:23] <hassanico> Someone explain the defense offense bars?
[0:24:24] <deviljhojho94> Lets get into fighting games tomatoCool
[0:24:45] <+chubbypencil> @hassanico meter gain is now just a cooldown timer
[0:24:59] <hassanico> @chubbypencil but only once per move per round?
[0:25:06] <scarletdye> It’s a pretty good quality of life change
[0:25:15] <JayEarly> @screamingmeat the arena ends up covered in blood at the end of a match
[0:25:29] <+chubbypencil> @hassanico nah just neutral and wait for them to fill
[0:25:32] <JayEarly> the floor is like a river

[0:26:22] <hassanico> with your heart so coooooool
[0:26:25] <FairOnFire> tekken has that too
[0:26:28] <+Michaelblack18> so far from all i have seen including maxes streams kotal looks like he is alot more fun to play then he was in MKX but that's just me
[0:26:37] <JayEarly> The funny thing is that Sub-Zero keeps telling people he’s not a ninja
[0:26:39] <Theworld732> The tutorial for this game is actually pretty good
[0:26:48] <%zeroarturia> Oh poor Kotal
[0:27:15] <JayEarly> Do his specials woolie
[0:27:21] <LozsCat> Try the tutorial
[0:27:35] <SchlongKongEduardo> 2nd var
[0:27:35] <%Solidnick18> backfoward x is his projectile
[0:27:48] <+LastHazzerd> the fun things aren't all legal
[0:28:06] <ManOfReason> HE HAS A MOVE CALLED GOD RAY ?!?!?
[0:28:10] <hassanico> ultra indepth
[0:28:11] <%ChoculaUltra> I always thought Kotal actually had blue skin for the longest time
[0:28:11] <@Menitta> The tutorial is amazing
[0:28:18] <hassanico> You can choose where to start
[0:28:23] <%Solidnick18> it's got stuff
[0:28:25] <wegood456> Is Kotal Maya or Aztec inspired?
[0:28:30] <+jetjagger222> theres character tutorials, albeit basic
[0:28:37] <hassanico> @wegood456 his race is "Osh-tek" so
[0:28:38] <APB_Harleqyn> Better than Guilty Gear training in my opinion
[0:28:42] <mankeyfigh> IN-DEPTH TUTORIAL
[0:28:57] <dredgyboi> this games story did a disservice to our boy Koatl
[0:29:02] <%SkaiVibration> SkaiVibration subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:29:08] <hassanico> that heal pillar is familiar
[0:29:10] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:29:12] <JayEarly> The only complaint I have about the tutorials is some of them are stupid hard
[0:29:17] <wegood456> @hassanico but he has 'Coatl parry' and all manner of south american move names
[0:29:21] <%Solidnick18> you can meter burn that
[0:29:39] <%Solidnick18> oh

[0:29:46] <+shinobi_magi> ayyyyy woolie!
[0:29:48] <hassanico> DEMONETIZED
[0:29:52] <mistersups> I don't like how Radically MK kharacters change between games
[0:29:52] <deviljhojho94> Kotal is Mayancatec
[0:30:02] <wegood456> I'll take it
[0:30:18] <+Order_of_Mystery> congrats on the RT partnership, @woolieversus ! any chance for some Castle Superbeast merch?
[0:30:35] <JayEarly> Does this variation have Panther Within?
[0:30:40] <+jetjagger222> b22 is whiff punisher
[0:31:48] <wegood456> After that blood drinking I feel he's clearly Aztec
[0:32:03] <Rexwarrior1> kevin hart is comedy-hee
[0:32:17] <good305coolguy> sub? i'd rather dom
[0:32:18] <+Davaxe> Reggie get in there
[0:32:21] <$gunplagoat> apatDab
[0:32:25] <SchlongKongEduardo> nice
[0:32:26] <JayEarly> Do the tournament variations have the special where he transforms into a cat
[0:32:33] <+jetjagger222> only in other variation
[0:32:54] <whatgoat_> he doesnt have amp iceball in this variation
[0:33:12] <%blaccbird914> @JayEarly yes
[0:33:22] <+jetjagger222> f2 overhead cancels into slide
[0:33:34] <+Order_of_Mystery> im sad reptile isnt playable
[0:33:35] <Mucmaster> What?? Thats an overhead!
[0:33:49] <deviljhojho94> How friendly is this game for people that have only played the first mortal kombat
[0:34:07] <Nineball_Luce> He's talking about the axe move that swings from above Sub's head
[0:34:07] <deviljhojho94> Bear in mind I do know all the lore because I have fuck all to do at my job crikIQ
[0:34:09] <Kaneis> Reptiles just invisible
[0:34:10] <JayEarly> it’s as beginner friendly as an FG can be
[0:34:12] <coreybom> @deviljhojho94 extremely so.
[0:34:19] <deviljhojho94> That's good to hear!
[0:34:25] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus What is a vortex?
[0:34:25] <deviljhojho94> I'll give it a shot
[0:34:32] <whatgoat_> the tutorial is really really good and the game provides all the information you need, like frame data @deviljhojho94
[0:34:58] <jonlambert0001> Did anyone mention you only get your Fatal Blow once per match?
[0:35:00] <deviljhojho94> @whatgoat_ I'll probably buy it even if it does not have my main man goro
[0:35:07] <%wolfofsound> @jonlambert0001 yes
[0:35:17] <whatgoat_> @Menitta a "vortex" is a situation where you are forced to guess a 50/50
[0:35:18] <wegood456> I don't like these multidirectional inputs. But I don't like any FG with those.
[0:35:18] <+jetjagger222> no bnb combos
[0:35:21] <+jetjagger222> but it shows key strings
[0:35:34] <jonlambert0001> Alright, just tuning in so didn't know
[0:35:37] <+Eureka_seveN77> youknow
[0:35:39] <@Menitta> Ah ok t
[0:35:50] <+Alpha_Druid> b32 df2 b143 bf3
[0:35:53] <+Alpha_Druid> for sub
[0:36:08] <wegood456> Is that hex code
[0:36:12] <+jetjagger222> low starter
[0:36:13] <+Alpha_Druid> or df 1
[0:36:14] <+Alpha_Druid> mb
[0:36:15] <whatgoat_> thats fighting game notation @wegood456
[0:36:23] <wegood456> It's hex code
[0:36:42] <whatgoat_> the numbers correspond to buttns
[0:36:42] <+Milpool> its a mac address Kappa
[0:36:42] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:36:44] <Nineball_Luce> why not both?
[0:36:45] <+jetjagger222> if sub is playing footsies use b14 as starter into iceball
[0:36:57] <ManOfReason> its a cheat code Kappa
[0:37:07] <%wolfofsound> it's a bingo!
[0:37:11] <whatgoat_> tell jer to dab
[0:37:13] <Nineball_Luce> well, James Chen often compares combos to inputting a code. lol
[0:37:14] <whatgoat_> then ill give tips
[0:37:16] <wegood456> The cheat is do more damage
[0:37:17] <Finchit> b1 df2 grab
[0:37:27] <Sloavon> are these tournament legal variations?
[0:37:27] <%jinking79> Xbox X=1 Y=2 A=3 B=4
[0:37:34] <Finchit> im fucking with ya lol
[0:37:38] <JayEarly> Sub-Zero seems pretty easy
[0:37:42] <wegood456> What about Switch?
[0:37:43] <Nineball_Luce> these are the tourney vars
[0:37:46] <mainevxnt> Your using the wrong special moves
[0:37:54] <nerdblase> Pretty sure that takes up a Game Genie line.
[0:38:07] <+jetjagger222> b2 does a minor launch for sub
[0:38:10] <%jinking79> PS S=1 T=2 X=3 C=4
[0:38:11] <Sambin0> for sub you can do b14 bf1 ji1 b14 bf3 ex
[0:38:11] <+jetjagger222> can link into 124
[0:38:13] <TheDr0t> @WoolieVersus subzeros amp ice ball destroys projectiles on the way
[0:38:24] <whatgoat_> its down forward 2
[0:38:35] <mainevxnt> You need cold shoulder
[0:38:37] <wegood456> ... C?
[0:38:39] <+jetjagger222> f2 for overhead
[0:38:43] <whatgoat_> forward 2
[0:38:45] <+Checktrap> b2
[0:38:48] <mainevxnt> Please add cold shoulder
[0:39:00] <bendatron> f2
[0:39:04] <whatgoat_> forward 2 for the overhead @WoolieVersus
[0:39:14] <Sambin0> cold shoulder is eh
[0:39:15] <ZachrowHS> anyone on ps4 that can game share this?
[0:39:21] <+jetjagger222> in 1st variation f2 cancels into MB iceball
[0:39:26] <JayEarly> I don’t like Cold Shoulder as much as slide tbh
[0:39:33] <whatgoat_> cold shoulder is worse raw but way better in combos
[0:39:38] <Sambin0> Subs third EX slide has a crushing blow
[0:39:42] <%UrsulaCat> His best qualities: his squeaks
[0:40:02] <wegood456> I can't believe such a competent and well-made fighting game has such scum double-dipping monetization practices.
[0:40:10] <+jetjagger222> d1 is also godly like in VF
[0:40:11] <@Menitta> OOF
[0:40:14] <JayEarly> yea
[0:40:25] <wegood456> Holy CRAP that saw
[0:40:26] <ArbyDMC> Isn't there a way to display whether a move is an overhead, mid or low?
[0:40:26] <FackinCrazy> LMAO look at this fucking oreo
[0:40:30] <%Solidnick18> yea an you can enhance that move
[0:40:42] <+lilCreepySleepy> I heard Kotal is bottom tier in this game
[0:40:45] <+Alpha_Druid> it's not monetization it's just grindy
[0:40:45] <whatgoat_> thats a special move
[0:40:47] <JayEarly> Curse WB for being greedy sumbitches with talented developers
[0:40:53] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:40:53] <+LastHazzerd> not even pay to win, you just have to sink time into so theyvhave an inflated amount of hours played

[0:45:55] <ArbyDMC> You get a skin for every character tutorial.

[0:50:05] <smalls8497> does Kotal Kahn have a wheelchair style
[0:50:05] <ArbyDMC> Oh by the way, flip stance button has a purpose now.

[0:52:45] <ArbyDMC> PAUSE UP UP REMATCH

[0:53:20] <+TopTieramisu> play sanic to commemorate the game changing movie trailer
[0:53:23] <%ChoculaUltra> Kotal drinking that sweet yeeyee juice
[0:53:23] <sjcodan> Drinking that blood should heal, like, 5 points
[0:53:36] <%Solidnick18> it just gives you more damage
[0:53:38] <+velliy2> drinking blood increases dmg
[0:53:43] <sjcodan> Oh, that's ok then
[0:54:00] <ArbyDMC> Crouch jabs are good if you wanna stop their turn
[0:54:16] <ArbyDMC> They come out on frame 7 so they're really fast
[0:54:26] <%Solidnick18> here we go

[0:58:10] <ZippyPsycho> Should do Kano/Skarlet and Kung Lao/Skarlet for their dialogue
[0:58:12] <%ChoculaUltra> that Z hat throw Kung Lao has gets me every fuggin time.
[0:58:12] <%juxtest> Kung Lao is dead too and hes in
[0:58:14] <JayEarly> @arbydmc Scorpion killed him in the comic so Hsu Hao has died twice somehow
[0:58:24] <JayEarly> Ed Boon hates him that much
[0:58:33] <%Hammerknife> how am i going to watch woolie and pat both when they're streaming at the same time
[0:58:36] <ArbyDMC> @JayEarly Time travel

[0:59:17] <%Hammerknife> @reiju_22 i mean literally i can't listen to both of them at the same time, crosses channels
[0:59:18] <SchlongKongEduardo> kung lao is sick
[0:59:18] <zakor1138> @JayEarly That reminds me of that Dracula comic where someone hated Drac so much that he revived him just so he could kill him
[0:59:22] <Sloavon> IP MAN PogChamp
[0:59:27] <MTLxSpider> you can break with Defence meter
[0:59:34] <sjcodan> @zakor1138 You mean Castlevania 2?
[0:59:39] <JayEarly> Kung Lao is such a smartass in this game
[0:59:47] <JayEarly> it’s great
[0:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[1:01:18] <coreybom> well
[1:01:25] <smevvster> Man I remember when Kung Lao was lame
[1:01:34] <sjcodan> KUNG LAO WAS NEVER LAME
[1:01:45] <JayEarly> This game saved Liu Kang
[1:01:56] <wolvenelf> kung lao summon hat
[1:01:58] <ArbyDMC> Fuck you Liu Kang was always awesome
[1:01:59] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought Kung Lao was cool in MK2 :/
[1:01:59] <Sloavon> i forgot liu kang was the chosen one
[1:02:00] <+TopTieramisu> kung lao was a jobber in the movie
[1:02:05] <%juxtest> Hes just not as good as Liu Kang
[1:02:12] <%TheOneUpWarrior> how does kung lao teleport through his hat? was it ever explained in the lore?
[1:02:15] <sjcodan> Liu Kang was never cool until this game
[1:02:29] <ArbyDMC> Liu Kang was always cool.
[1:02:31] <%Solidnick18> what

[1:03:14] <turf_wind_and_fire> Like no joke they actually tested HIV positive from doing that procedure
[1:03:14] <%ChoculaUltra> which means Reggie saw "vampire facial" and double clicked hard af.

[1:06:41] <@akuda_bar> spine is stored in the balls
[1:06:47] <MTLxSpider> man
[1:06:48] <JayEarly> The skull is still screaming
[1:06:48] <NovaKnightmare> the banter in this game is great
[1:06:52] <MTLxSpider> these cheesy intros
[1:06:55] <sjcodan> ???
[1:07:18] <JayEarly> There is like a half hour of intro dialogue for every character
[1:07:27] <MTLxSpider> probably
[1:07:30] <MTLxSpider> check on yotube
[1:07:33] <@Menitta> So Cassie's B2 is a good normal to be using
[1:07:35] <zakor1138> Noob mirror match can have a Harry Potter reference
[1:08:17] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:08:24] <whatgoat_> you can get a guaranteed slide after a jumpin kick hits on sub
[1:08:48] <mistersups> No Boobs either

[1:09:12] <@Menitta> And voiced by Futaba in this
[1:09:13] <smevvster> testicles gettin crushed is a-okay but a little bit of skin is ding-dong bannu
[1:09:19] <Make_me_mad> Cassie's great. They should have just had her and no Sonya.
[1:09:21] <jonlambert0001> Johnnys pretty cool too
[1:09:23] <%UrsulaCat> Balls+no dick is an ok fetish
[1:09:34] <+TopTieramisu> got to conform to the core values
[1:09:39] <+Rada150> nice Hydro skin Sub zero
[1:09:50] <%Solidnick18> geras is some nonsense
[1:10:19] <+Alpha_Druid> you can do b143 into db2 for big chip as sub
[1:10:19] <Kalcom> sacrifice the clock for more time on the clock
[1:10:22] <sjcodan> BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
[1:10:24] <ArbyDMC> CHINESE NINJA WARRIOR
[1:10:38] <+Rada150> so anyone think the PC leak that there will be 19 dlc characters is valid or is that full of shit
[1:10:42] <businesscasualninja> WITH A HEART SO COLD
[1:10:47] <smevvster> While I like his aesthetic design, Geras is just conceptually boring as hell to me.
[1:10:48] <ArbyDMC> SUB ZEROOO
[1:10:50] <WolfDogF> Yo Johnny in the back, never notice that
[1:10:51] <frankcastle308> With your heart so cold!
[1:11:21] <frankcastle308> OooHHHH YOUR HEART IS A MYSTERY
[1:11:22] <JayEarly> I don’t know about 19 but they’re planning to support it longer than previous NRS titles
[1:11:36] <businesscasualninja> WARRIOR WITH A MASK
[1:11:58] <sappinmahbinyot> I hope they never nerf geras
[1:11:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:14] <Sloavon> WRYYYY
[1:12:19] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:12:34] <+Rada150> i mean seeing how the story mode literally ended the MK story as we know it and allows them to rewrite, they might as well bring in everyone history
[1:12:38] <%jinking79> better than sonic
[1:12:39] <CerberusDriver> sub zero is best ninja dont @ me
[1:12:53] <smevvster> @CerberusDriver that's not scorpion you liar dont @ me
[1:13:03] <gatesAndLogic> @CerberusDriver not picking scorpion DansGame
[1:13:20] <Make_me_mad> Reptile is the best ninja, goddamnit.
[1:13:22] <ArbyDMC> How can you say either of them are best when Smoke exists
[1:13:28] <@Menitta> Noob counts as a ninja right?
[1:13:31] <sappinmahbinyot> Yo wait is it just me or is Geras the only one who doesn't have slowdown on hits in his fatal blow? Does that mean you can't damage boost it or is it just aesthetic cause of his time control?
[1:13:33] <CerberusDriver> Smoke aint done shit
[1:13:33] <necrocannibal2> @Make_me_mad absolutely
[1:13:38] <smevvster> ZEKU is best ninja
[1:13:39] <%juxtest> When will we get Ermac erback
[1:13:45] <bendatron> @ArbyDMC what he said
[1:13:48] <@Menitta> Ermac is the actual best
[1:13:49] <CerberusDriver> ermac is in the krypt ;)
[1:13:50] <heyitsdenzel_> Strider
[1:13:53] <@Menitta> He existed from nothing
[1:13:57] <necrocannibal2> NANI
[1:13:59] <@Menitta> And became the coolest
[1:14:03] <+Rada150> Hydro is best and he died in the comics
[1:14:14] <zakor1138> But Rain tho
[1:14:23] <Kalcom> why the time guy has to do a donut
[1:14:23] <SnaKemuho> just tuned in, is Woolz disappointed with Kotal like everyone else?
[1:14:28] <+Rada150> also Tremor
[1:14:30] <sappinmahbinyot> Hydro is just lame Rain
[1:14:41] <CerberusDriver> Kotal is literally the slowest character in the game
[1:14:44] <sappinmahbinyot> Rain DLC please
[1:14:47] <+Rada150> hydro is all water, rain is storms
[1:14:51] <spardanwarrior> @WoolieVersus Geras Fatality 2 is D F B 1 (close)
[1:15:01] <+Rada150> cause rain also has lightning
[1:15:06] <+Rada150> which Raiden has
[1:15:09] <mankeyfigh> @snakemuho nah, he hasn’t played the story yet
[1:15:31] <+swan5260> wodo you think there will be another killer instinct Game?
[1:15:31] <zakor1138> No, Chameleon is the best ninja
[1:15:33] <sappinmahbinyot> @cerberusdriver Shao Kahn is actually slower where it counts (main combo starter is garbage startup and suuuuper punishable)
[1:15:42] <+Rada150> Khrome is superior
[1:15:52] <CerberusDriver> nah Pantherk is best
[1:15:55] <sappinmahbinyot> Shao Kahn is so trash and it's sad. Kotal is better in every way.
[1:16:00] <sappinmahbinyot> P A N T H E R K
[1:16:03] <mankeyfigh> They’re aren’t using any environmentals are they?
[1:16:09] <+Rada150> Pantherk is only superior cause his soundbyte would crash the game
[1:16:12] <@Menitta> MK12 should be everyone is here
[1:16:13] <+LastHazzerd> i love military base stages in fighting games
[1:16:37] <sappinmahbinyot> @menitta I don't exactly know if I want Kobra back.
[1:16:38] <iamtheTwitchghost> BRiNG BACK HSU HAO
[1:16:38] <necrocannibal2> @Menitta unfortunately I think MK will take a break for a while
[1:16:40] <WolfDogF> *que Guile theme*
[1:16:44] <necrocannibal2> Ed Boon at last is super tired of MK, lol
[1:16:45] <spardanwarrior> @WoolieVersus Geras Fatality 2 is D F B 1 (close)
[1:16:45] <heyitsdenzel_> Shao Kahn has charisma
[1:16:48] <@Solidus_113> Just MK11 tonight, no poverty?
[1:16:48] <necrocannibal2> at least*
[1:16:50] <@Menitta> You'll get Kobra and LIKE IT
[1:16:53] <+TopTieramisu> kotal gets trashed all story
[1:17:02] <CerberusDriver> I would take Kobra if they made him cool
[1:17:05] <Bloogoose> When's Mokap?
[1:17:06] <sappinmahbinyot> Erron black literally drops hsu hao's dismembered head in an intro LUL
[1:17:22] <+Rada150> Want to do Hsu Hao right make it so his reactor gives him radiation poisoning and his body is shriveled and decrepit and he has to walk around in a survival suit like Mr Freeze
[1:17:27] <kalinflip> @sappinmahbinyot the best intro
[1:17:28] <%QueequegTheater> It's switch to skarlet because she's ccoler
[1:17:28] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> D, F, B, 1
[1:17:28] <+Alpha_Druid> dfb1
[1:17:36] <+Alpha_Druid> close
[1:17:38] <SnaKemuho> dfb1 touching
[1:17:50] <Make_me_mad> Honestly this game's story disappointed me so much I don't even want them to make another Mortal Kombat.
[1:17:50] <necrocannibal2> Geras fatal blow is super good
[1:17:54] <MATTHUGHh> i heard mk11 sold so bad it is on sale 10 bucks off in some shops
[1:17:58] <Make_me_mad> Just straight up leave it in the grave.
[1:18:09] <+TopTieramisu> did it really?
[1:18:10] <CerberusDriver> the story was better than MKX but 11's story has a lot of problems
[1:18:19] <+TopTieramisu> it's hard to imagine an MK game not selling well
[1:18:21] <%Solidnick18> i think you can enhance the chop
[1:18:24] <AlanJoestar> Make_me_mad i mean if the do that it would be built from the ground up so who knows maybe the realize they fucked up lol
[1:18:27] <kalinflip> !uptime
[1:18:27] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 18 minutes
[1:18:33] <kalinflip> COOL
[1:18:37] <MATTHUGHh> like? @CerberusDriver
[1:18:38] <kalinflip> atpRtsd4
[1:18:40] <mankeyfigh> Are we really judging fighting games by PLOT
[1:18:40] <%Makototruth> Makototruth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:18:46] <CerberusDriver> plot points that go nowhere
[1:18:48] <reiju_22> meh
[1:18:52] <+Rada150> Listen SFV had a pretty shitty opening and got better over time hopefully MK can do that to
[1:18:54] <MATTHUGHh> teah, right? @TopTieramisu
[1:19:01] <SnaKemuho> 9's story was good because they had a lot of lore to expand upon, then it just became a fanfic
[1:19:02] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:19:02] <Kalcom> why not shatter the ice
[1:19:07] <%Gamefriendly> whats up guys, i just tuned in. who's the guest
[1:19:08] <Make_me_mad> @mankeyfigh The plot is actually the only reason I care about Mortal Kombat. I understand that makes me an idiot, but also I don't care.
[1:19:10] <coreybom> @mankeyfigh With MK, we kinda have to.
[1:19:13] <zakor1138> Fighting game plots should never be the reason to judge a fighting game
[1:19:30] <CerberusDriver> I dont like that argument., Just because its a fighting game doesnt mean its allowed to suck.
[1:19:33] <mankeyfigh> @coreybom wha?
[1:19:35] <volraths_bane> His 2nd fatality in this pays homage to the original
[1:19:37] <Bloogoose> Why does Geras have a femto helmet?
[1:19:38] <ArbyDMC> I'm convinced MK9's story being so good was a fluke.
[1:19:38] <CerberusDriver> If the story is bad, then its bad
[1:19:39] <iamthegreatest514> Ohhh wtf jer
[1:19:41] <MATTHUGHh> @mankeyfigh since sfv PROVED fgames NEED a story to sell, YEA.
[1:19:48] <+Irridium> eh, I had fun with the story
[1:19:59] <sappinmahbinyot> Geras does some prrtty good combo damage but i don't know the knputs
[1:20:16] <NovaKnightmare> kinda looks like a black panther cosplay
[1:20:25] <@Solidus_113> I think it's around 6 per character
[1:20:31] <+TopTieramisu> he looks like a cross between zasalamel and thanos
[1:20:33] <SnaKemuho> there's 3 or 4 intros for each side
[1:20:38] <mankeyfigh> @matthughh yeah, but mechanically SFV was kinda wonky mechanically
[1:20:41] <Sloavon> @NovaKnightmare cmonBruh why's that?
[1:20:42] <bamcc2> Do a EX Slide with R1
[1:20:42] <%Solidnick18> pickupdasoap
[1:20:48] <JayEarly> Best intro is Johnny Cage vs Johnny Cage
[1:20:50] <coreybom> @mankeyfigh They put alot of effort into their stories, and while gameplay always comes first, when you put that much effort into the story, it's make sense to judge it alongside compared to others.
[1:20:54] <NovaKnightmare> the mask, honestly
[1:20:55] <necrocannibal2> what actually makes this MK kind of eh to me is the roster
[1:20:55] <+Order_of_Mystery> Johnny's mirror intros are fantastic.
[1:20:56] <sappinmahbinyot> @matthughh SFV also proved fighting games don't need to be good to have a competitive scene as long as the company pours ass money into it Kappa
[1:20:58] <JayEarly> We.Are.Sexy
[1:21:13] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Chatroom which fatality is your favorite asking for a friend
[1:21:13] <necrocannibal2> the base MK2 roster should be obligatory in every MK installment IMO
[1:21:20] <+Rada150> the biggest problem with MK 11 story line is the ending Liu Kang can pretty much make the universe not need mortal kombat to maintain balance, unless there is some big bad hiding at the beginning of time they kind of made future mK games unecessary story wise
[1:21:21] <+Order_of_Mystery> We are sexy bitches
[1:21:22] <+LastHazzerd> heatin' up
[1:21:25] <+Rapidfastrider> naroSmug
[1:21:29] <+TopTieramisu> i do love cassie's nut split fatal
[1:21:38] <MATTHUGHh> @Make_me_mad you're not an idiot: MANY admitting it AND not have grown up with those characters and care about how they are written. that's plot-interest.
[1:21:42] <%Solidnick18> christ
[1:21:44] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> the nut split one is pretty great ngl
[1:21:48] <SnaKemuho> my favorite fatality is a normal punch because watching that shit became boring a while ago
[1:21:52] <+jetjagger222> pretty much
[1:22:06] <+Rapidfastrider> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug naroSmug naroStaryn
[1:22:09] <+LastHazzerd> gotta do it for the hearts yo
[1:22:11] <SnaKemuho> thank Boon for brutalities at least
[1:22:13] <+TopTieramisu> that's my new fav fatal
[1:22:14] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Rapidfastrider naroSmug
[1:22:19] <sappinmahbinyot> @rada150 Arcade endings are non canon but they do prove that NRS is open to things that are before elder dogs
[1:22:21] <@Solidus_113> you can do the fatal inputs slowly and it'll still work
[1:22:22] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> doodStare
[1:22:27] <necrocannibal2> they'll definitely nerf Geras' fatal blow, lol
[1:22:28] <fluke_LKZ> Do the fatal, bro
[1:22:29] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> my favorite fatal is Geras' second fatal because it's disgusting and I hate it
[1:22:32] <%jinking79> they need the range of the Fatal too
[1:22:32] <%linkwolf4> lytFILTH
[1:22:34] <WolfDogF> BUUUURRTAL!!!
[1:22:34] <fluke_LKZ> Also do kombo
[1:22:35] <necrocannibal2> shit is too good
[1:22:39] <+Alpha_Druid> you over head is f2,4
[1:22:41] <%Solidnick18> oooo scorpion
[1:22:43] <+jetjagger222> you need ex freeze
[1:22:45] <sappinmahbinyot> Geras' second fatality is super nasty
[1:22:46] <+jetjagger222> to combo from overhead
[1:22:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember woolie, NANOMACHINES
[1:22:54] <CerberusDriver> I dont like dressing up the ninjas in colors that aren't their colors.
[1:22:55] <%Solidnick18> apatDab
[1:22:58] <JayEarly> Kano has one of the best and one of the worst fatals
[1:22:59] <CerberusDriver> Scorpion looks wack in green
[1:22:59] <MATTHUGHh> @zakor1138 i disagree: plot make the characters evolve, and chracters are what thether noobs&casuals to franchises. lil reminder that sfv didnt have the casuals seal of approval at launch. capcom trusted the fgc & paid for it.
[1:22:59] <mankeyfigh> FIRE AND ICE
[1:22:59] <+jetjagger222> f2 MB iceball
[1:23:08] <+LastHazzerd> Scorpion's tourny moves don't include misery blade, right?
[1:23:15] <SnaKemuho> they don't
[1:23:18] <sappinmahbinyot> It's probably the most fucked up fatality in mk
[1:23:19] <+Rada150> Jax's ending proved they need better writers and people who don't have politcal agenda in teh company
[1:23:27] <Carl_Von_Lucoa> hey sup woolie
[1:23:30] <sappinmahbinyot> Uh oh, yikes moment
[1:23:32] <necrocannibal2> I fucking the fire tornado intro, lol
[1:23:37] <ArbyDMC> Oh fuck off it's a non canon arcade ending who cares.
[1:23:38] <necrocannibal2> fucking love*
[1:23:50] <@akuda_bar> dudes in the background having a nice barbeque
[1:23:51] <sappinmahbinyot> Scorpion's firenado is so beautiful
[1:23:51] <%linkwolf4> lytWIPED
[1:23:52] <CerberusDriver> Scorpion needs Misery Blade to be viable tbh
[1:23:54] <JayEarly> Yes ending slavery is very contentious issue
[1:23:55] <+Alpha_Druid> scorp doesnt really need missblade anymore because they made him a lot safer
[1:24:02] <+RedMageRebel> imagine getting mad at a black person ending slavery FailFish
[1:24:06] <+Alpha_Druid> also tele cancel is hella buff
[1:24:10] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:24:14] <+jetjagger222> scorp has very consistent pressure and decent footsies
[1:24:16] <+CrackPebbles> This is the fuck neutral variation
[1:24:18] <sappinmahbinyot> What did they buff on scorp?
[1:24:21] <Make_me_mad> I'd actually like a patch that just adds "Also we ended slavery" to every character's arcade ending.
[1:24:21] <mankeyfigh> goteem
[1:24:23] <+SvenHolgersson> Anyone using the term woke deserves nothing but scorn
[1:24:24] <Make_me_mad> Just double down on it.
[1:24:26] <Ripshot91> how do you even get that good? my god
[1:24:27] <antthefool> TALK THAT SHIT
[1:24:29] <%UrsulaCat> That take isn’t very woke @necrocannibal2
[1:24:36] <SnaKemuho> I wish that scorp always dabbed away like in that one cutscenes
[1:24:50] <Sloavon> @SvenHolgersson why's that? cmonbruh
[1:24:51] <ArbyDMC> The one game where I main Scorpion.
[1:24:59] <ArbyDMC> Cause Smoke isn't here.
[1:25:12] <Sloavon> @SvenHolgersson cmonBruh *
[1:25:18] <+LastHazzerd> woolie don't know what he talkin' about
[1:25:19] <%Makototruth> After an ice ball you can do j1 into b143 into slide for more damage .
[1:25:19] <+TxukasaVersus> awoo
[1:25:20] <@Menitta> woolieGASM
[1:25:21] <Storm_Samurai> 10/10
[1:25:22] <CerberusDriver> No its not?
[1:25:23] <ManOfReason> SYMMETRY
[1:25:25] <Gutsandlove> the sickest
[1:25:27] <+RedMageRebel> @svenholgersson only if the people talking about "cultural Marxism" get the same
[1:25:28] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> hot take: That fatal is boring
[1:25:28] <+jetjagger222> that's not noob saibot
[1:25:29] <mayorrev> yeryeyeyeye
[1:25:33] <CerberusDriver> Theres a few that are better
[1:25:34] <mankeyfigh> Woke is a word, just like LIT
[1:25:35] <+LastHazzerd> 10/10 correct, best? no
[1:25:36] <%linkwolf4> AS GOD AS MY WITNESS.
[1:25:37] <TheValiantBob> I would have a poster of that fatality not gonna lie
[1:25:39] <Make_me_mad> The best fatalities are like that one and Cassie's nut-shot split: Simple and fast.
[1:25:39] <%Solidnick18> noob has a good one
[1:25:41] <CptBritches> D'Vorah has the best
[1:25:41] <ArbyDMC> @WoolieVersus Johnny Cage's fatalities are so much better.
[1:25:43] <JayEarly> Kano dancing tho
[1:25:44] <+Rada150> no it's not ending slavery it's the huge paradox you create seeing how most african americans are descendants of slaves and by stopping slavery, jax ended teh existance of millions of black people and potentially his own wifer
[1:25:45] <adamisfruit> Woolie you haven’t seen all the others
[1:25:49] <%Fiend95> It's a strong one, but there are some REALLY good ones
[1:25:50] <CerberusDriver> Cage and Noobs
[1:25:54] <%Solidnick18> i like most of johnny
[1:25:56] <ArbyDMC> Nae
[1:25:59] <spardanwarrior> "Johnny Cage wants to know you're location"
[1:26:00] <@akuda_bar> all right we're moving on from this topic
[1:26:04] <ArbyDMC> Dvorah's are too good.
[1:26:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:08] <spardanwarrior> *your
[1:26:08] <%Fiend95> Jax has a really strong one
[1:26:09] <+Bearjewpiter> " apatHoldon " - SubZero
[1:26:10] <fluke_LKZ> "It wasn't me."
[1:26:11] <Make_me_mad> I actually really dislike how a lot of fatalities are super overdone these days.
[1:26:11] <+SvenHolgersson> Noob's got the best one imo
[1:26:13] <@akuda_bar> everyone get motivated
[1:26:16] <dimensaur> Kabal's are pretty dope
[1:26:16] <+RedMageRebel> @rada150 in the words of memes; "it's not that deep brah"
[1:26:19] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Rada150 you do realize that without slavery those people would still exist right
[1:26:21] <+LastHazzerd> it is really cool
[1:26:23] <@akuda_bar> !motivated
[1:26:23] <@Moobot> 333 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:26:25] <sappinmahbinyot> @rada150 The ending literally said jax found a timeline where ending slavery made the world better for literally everyone, stop lying lmao.
[1:26:28] <%linkwolf4> !motivated
[1:26:29] <SnaKemuho> Liu dropping an arcade machine is the best tality
[1:26:36] <coreybom> @rada150 oh snap, you're one those dudes. Please leave.
[1:26:36] <MickeyMoore13> !motivated
[1:26:39] <+LastHazzerd> MK11's Fatalities probably average out to be the best
[1:26:43] <volraths_bane> @rada150 The ending addresses that, he goes through countless variations til he settled on one
[1:26:43] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @MATTHUGHh
[1:26:43] <mankeyfigh> @rada150 Jax manipulation of time was precise enough to keep his wife and daughter
[1:26:57] <sappinmahbinyot> Guys theory fime
[1:26:57] <ArbyDMC> You should check out D'vorah's fatalities. They're so disgusting. @WoolieVersus
[1:27:05] <JayEarly> I agree
[1:27:08] <+jetjagger222> dvorah has great ones too
[1:27:15] <Make_me_mad> Jax has one of the best fatalities ever, with his clothesline.
[1:27:21] <Storm_Samurai> A lot of great ones in this game
[1:27:23] <+Haarute> Or Johnny's.
[1:27:25] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @mankeyfigh technically it wasn't precise, he just went through it a bunch of times until he finally got the right timeline
[1:27:33] <CerberusDriver> Ill be honest, I still dont like Jacqui
[1:27:34] <Sloavon> it doesn't
[1:27:35] <dimensaur> Jax's are pretty great too
[1:27:35] <TheValiantBob> they should check out Frost's fatalities, the cyborg one is cool as hell
[1:27:36] <+LastHazzerd> bone is much harder to burn than flesh
[1:27:41] <+ChrisAlgoo> No white nationalists in the woolie chat plz
[1:27:44] <+jetjagger222> oh yeah the brain one is sick
[1:27:48] <pixelman421> For the erasing of his family thing, even if he didn’t find a way to make things perfect.... that’s what Jax would do. He’s a hero
[1:27:50] <sappinmahbinyot> Spectre scorpion dabs cause he's younger than current scorp/hanzo
[1:27:54] <@akuda_bar> y'all we're moving on
[1:27:56] <mankeyfigh> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug true dat
[1:27:56] <Storm_Samurai> ?
[1:28:00] <+LastHazzerd> "Noob is a zoner" *watches Max's streams*
[1:28:04] <volraths_bane> @necrocannibal2 Because she can't retry if she's wipedfrom existence on the first try
[1:28:04] <CerberusDriver> Noob Saibot is top tier
[1:28:10] <+jetjagger222> noob is great
[1:28:18] <+RedMageRebel> the only new kombat kid I didn't like was kuhn Jin or however you say his name
[1:28:19] <+jetjagger222> footsie/punish
[1:28:24] <sappinmahbinyot> Noob has one of the worsr zoner loadouts, his combos are way better
[1:28:24] <Storm_Samurai> Kung Lao has some crazy stylish moves
[1:28:24] <SnaKemuho> Jacquie as a character is boring, but her gameplay in 11 is very satisfying
[1:28:26] <+jetjagger222> key string is f2212
[1:28:28] <+Alpha_Druid> seeing double is the mk9-like variation
[1:28:29] <ManOfReason> noob is my favorite edgy boi
[1:28:29] <+RedMageRebel> the whole bow thing felt weird in a fighting game
[1:28:30] <SnaKemuho> with cancels and shit
[1:28:33] <Make_me_mad> Cassie and Takeda were the coolest Kombat Kids, but Jacqui is alright too. I kinda wish she'd replaced Jax and Cassie replaced Sonya.
[1:28:35] <nightwing1936> Tobias left Midway 20 years ago. I think he does mobile games now
[1:28:41] <@Menitta> He got UE3 to run at 60 when Epic was like "Nah, impossible"
[1:28:45] <mistersups> DR. KLAW
[1:28:48] <%Solidnick18> the shockmaster
[1:28:49] <sappinmahbinyot> Noob's zoning is even worse than mk9 cause his defensive options aren't as good anymore
[1:28:53] <ArbyDMC> EXCUSE ME?
[1:28:54] <Storm_Samurai> I love that throw
[1:28:57] <CerberusDriver> Noobs voice acting is amazing
[1:29:00] <+LastHazzerd> again, woolie don't know what he's talkinga bout
[1:29:08] <sappinmahbinyot> I AM THE SHOCKMASTER
[1:29:16] <Storm_Samurai> Noobs voice acting is more whispery, less dr. claw than the trailer
[1:29:16] <Make_me_mad> Noob's voice is the worst.
[1:29:18] <+rorschachsjournal505> Oh come on it’s a great voice
[1:29:19] <C_game_me_811> Woolie please
[1:29:19] <ArbyDMC> Woolie once again is wrong
[1:29:20] <+universboy95> Yeah it's pretty lazy
[1:29:20] <+jetjagger222> he sounds like the melty face orc from return of the king
[1:29:23] <WolfDogF> Revali voice Noob
[1:29:28] <wolvenelf> its pretty bad
[1:29:29] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I personally love Noob's new voice. I'm always a big fan of "super deep to the point where its comically evil"
[1:29:29] <+LastHazzerd> i'm sorry, was noob supposed to NOT be edgelord claw?
[1:29:30] <Make_me_mad> But Ronda Rousey's acting is the worst.
[1:29:32] <Ks201> noob sounds like a precursor from jak
[1:29:44] <+LastHazzerd> was Noob supposed to be COOL?
[1:29:45] <CerberusDriver> How can you say Noob is worse than Ronda, lmao
[1:29:49] <Storm_Samurai> I think we can all agree Ronda Rousey is a big OOF
[1:29:54] <+LastHazzerd> @MATTHUGHh stop
[1:29:54] <Aphex_0> Noob sounds like the synthetic boss announcer thing from No More Heroes
[1:29:56] <NovaKnightmare> Imagine Noob busting through a wall and dropping his shadow clone like an asshole
[1:30:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @MATTHUGHh oh my god stop already
[1:30:03] <sappinmahbinyot> Whag the fuck was that essay
[1:30:03] <Mr_Taters > @Ks201 oh yeah he does haha
[1:30:04] <@akuda_bar> @matthughh stop.
[1:30:08] <%juxtest> I wonder if Scorpion could find a timeline where Sub Zero actually killed his family
[1:30:08] <JayEarly> I mean at least Noob sounds like a character
[1:30:11] <Ripshot91> What does that mean???
[1:30:13] <DarthTaco> noob's voice is sean chiplock who also voices rash in killer instinct
[1:30:13] <Ripshot91> I'm a noob
[1:30:13] <Fatman2124> I rather have Dr Claw than Rousey
[1:30:13] <T_Sasquatch> his clone is lifting him like a new born LUL
[1:30:15] <JayEarly> Unlike Sonya
[1:30:17] <+Irridium> what in the god damn hell are you even talking about
[1:30:20] <Sloavon> Noob's voice will grow on you. Sonya's won't.
[1:30:27] <+Alpha_Druid> wwoolie f2212 is a real good string
[1:30:27] <%Solidnick18> bam
[1:30:33] <%Solidnick18> OOOO
[1:30:35] <KingVantq> all of this over an arcade ending LUL
[1:30:38] <Smart_ZaK1> Why didn't they just get Noob's VA from MK9?
[1:30:39] <fluke_LKZ> Slap on the back of the head
[1:30:44] <+LastHazzerd> Noob's voice fits, Sonya is reading a script
[1:30:48] <+ChrisAlgoo> Please ban
[1:30:48] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @juxtest I thought sub zero did actually kill the shirai ryu, he was just being mind controlled or tricked or something by Qui Gon Chi
[1:30:48] <Storm_Samurai> can we ban this guy
[1:30:49] <JayEarly> Also Noob lays the SICKEST burn on Shao Khan
[1:30:56] <JoeyStar> noob sounds like other characters it’s such a bad choice
[1:31:01] <runningfleet> what does he say to shao khan
[1:31:03] <+SvenHolgersson> Noob is great voice and all
[1:31:04] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:31:04] <+Order_of_Mystery> rip schmuck
[1:31:06] <+jetjagger222> STUFFED
[1:31:06] <+RedMageRebel> @matthughh dude go whine somewhere else
[1:31:09] <@akuda_bar> he's timed out
[1:31:13] <NovaKnightmare> Oh hes got a fucking ghoul face, I didnt even notice
[1:31:14] <+LastHazzerd> Noob has great combos but the dev team wants him to be a zoner
[1:31:15] <%jinking79> yeah ppl shit talk Noob is good
[1:31:16] <sappinmahbinyot> Geras has insane crushing blows
[1:31:20] <heyitsdenzel_> Check Max's Noob
[1:31:22] <NumberTooBig> what shmuck, i dont see one Kappa
[1:31:27] <CerberusDriver> People are dumb, Noob is top tier for real
[1:31:28] <Make_me_mad> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Sub killed Scorpion, I think Quan Chi poisoned the rest if you go by Mythologies.
[1:31:28] <+jetjagger222> noob aint no zoner
[1:31:32] <T_Sasquatch> Geras is a lot cooler than he sems
[1:31:33] <Crankthulhu> @WoolieVersus Just came here to say Lythero just announced a Vergil emote, so you got some competition
[1:31:33] <Theworld732> The other noob variation is the better one
[1:31:34] <Storm_Samurai> @akuda_bar thx
[1:31:37] <+jetjagger222> great counter-zoner though
[1:31:39] <+Davaxe> Reggie Telling hard truths
[1:31:40] <+McSoliace> has noob ever not been edgy?
[1:31:42] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Make_me_mad cirISee the mortal kombat lore is complicated
[1:31:43] <sappinmahbinyot> Geras is very high tier
[1:31:59] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> noob wasn't edgy when he was just a recolor of scorpion with no lore naroSmug
[1:32:04] <+LastHazzerd> The dev team's "tournament legal" variations are kinda why i've no interest in seeing tourny play
[1:32:12] <CerberusDriver> Noob seems to have become some personfication of Death in MK 11, when before he was just black ninja swap
[1:32:19] <%linkwolf4> it's week 1, people need to take their fingers off the tier list triggers.
[1:32:24] <fluke_LKZ> Check the notes
[1:32:28] <+jetjagger222> yes
[1:32:30] <mankeyfigh> As a character, Geras seems to rely on his immortality rather than actual combat proficiency
[1:32:30] <fluke_LKZ> Just like back then
[1:32:34] <NumberTooBig> @CerberusDriver they somehow made Reaper even dumber
[1:32:34] <sappinmahbinyot> Geras is how they should do tourney variations lmao
[1:32:35] <+jetjagger222> do a quick punish string into FB
[1:32:36] <T_Sasquatch> i still cant believe its just been a week
[1:32:39] <+LastHazzerd> grotesque more like
[1:32:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> what characters are bad?
[1:32:41] <ArbyDMC> OH GOD THIS ONE
[1:32:41] <T_Sasquatch> AHHHH#
[1:32:43] <TheValiantBob> I love how they dial up Noob's cheese to 11 in his arcade ending where he literally says "I am become Death Destroyer of Worlds"
[1:32:43] <sappinmahbinyot> both of geras's variations are great
[1:32:44] <NumberTooBig> juicy
[1:32:46] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @LastHazzerd I hope that some TOs do it like smash 4 did and have side tourneys where all customizations are legal
[1:32:47] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:32:48] <heyitsdenzel_> Geras is a saiyan
[1:32:48] <Storm_Samurai> OH MY GOD
[1:32:49] <+LastHazzerd> Banned in Japan
[1:32:50] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[1:32:51] <+jetjagger222> shao kahn and dvorah
[1:32:51] <+Irridium> ooooooooooooof
[1:32:52] <reiju_22> :/
[1:32:53] <T_Sasquatch> Thats like the most hardcore fatality in the game
[1:32:53] <mayorrev> THATS NUTS
[1:32:54] <+JohnXuandou> KoF has a lot of safe supers too
[1:32:54] <+Xombor> sbfpScared
[1:32:55] <@Menitta> I find special cancels so difficult to pull off in this oddly enough
[1:32:55] <ArbyDMC> D'vorah has another one like that
[1:32:57] <bamcc2> xD
[1:32:59] <Make_me_mad> I feel like it was kinda lazy to give Noob normal human colored organs and blood in this one.
[1:32:59] <fluke_LKZ> PEELED LIKE AN ORANGE
[1:33:00] <%Solidnick18> banned in japan lol
[1:33:03] <%linkwolf4> but HOW THO
[1:33:05] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> when I first saw that fatality I was like *this close* to actually throwing up
[1:33:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:09] <CerberusDriver> @NumberTooBig hes great though?
[1:33:09] <+DarkOnyx7> WutFace
[1:33:13] <NumberTooBig> @linkwolf4 shut up is how
[1:33:16] <+Alpha_Druid> bf2 for mid bf 4 for low
[1:33:17] <CptBritches> D'Vorah has the only fatality I've ever seen that I would actually call disturbing
[1:33:17] <mayorrev> chairKillager chairKillager chairKillager
[1:33:20] <SydSavage> legit the ad that popped up was "have your pie and eat it too"- targeted ads are scary as fuck
[1:33:27] <ArbyDMC> D'vorah's fatalities almost made me puke.
[1:33:34] <%linkwolf4> @NumberTooBig as all things should be.
[1:33:42] <mankeyfigh> I’m still so confused on Japan’s censorship methods
[1:33:48] <Make_me_mad> I think Kano's dancing fatality is actually my favorite in this whole game.
[1:33:51] <sappinmahbinyot> You know geras is good when he can counter zoning with fucking 34% from full screen.
[1:33:57] <+Irridium> I still think noob's MK9 wishbone fatality is the one that gets me the most. can barely watch it
[1:33:59] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I hate d'vorah because bug shit is like the one thing I can't stand
[1:33:59] <+ChrisAlgoo> She make you gregnant with beeeeeees
[1:34:01] <sappinmahbinyot> I love his existence.
[1:34:03] <+LastHazzerd> some characters have quick start up, some dont
[1:34:12] <CerberusDriver> @Irridium because it starts at the crotch
[1:34:13] <+Rada150> japans's censorship is , sexuality is ok ultraviolence is bad it's the inverse of the west
[1:34:13] <+Order_of_Mystery> d'vorah has some excellent body horror in her moves. shes great
[1:34:22] <JayEarly> D’vorah’s fatal grosses me out but I love it because it’s totally a homage to The Thing
[1:34:33] <ArbyDMC> I never understood the hype with the Make A Wish fatality
[1:34:39] <ArbyDMC> It's good
[1:34:40] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Irridium for me it was Ermac's fatality in MKX where he'd twist you and pull out your guts. That one is still the worst one so far IMO
[1:34:42] <SnaKemuho> there's a video of some dude playing vs wavedashing Shao Kahn and he's pretty insane
[1:34:45] <ArbyDMC> but not that good.
[1:34:45] <yuribo26> Hello Punch Dad
[1:34:46] <+grandobsidian> give him Za Worldo!
[1:34:48] <%HDmexiqtioner> Hey Everyone.
[1:34:51] <+LastHazzerd> i'm sure a lot of people here have seen Max play Noob

[1:35:23] <yuribo26> @joestar4 sounds like a sidekick
[1:35:27] <Gutsandlove> oh ho
[1:35:30] <NumberTooBig> big hulk hands were a nice touch for geras
[1:35:31] <fluke_LKZ> PEEL HIM LIKE AN ORANGE

[1:35:59] <%Solidnick18> cool
[1:36:08] <JayEarly> Noob Saibot also has an amazing fatality
[1:36:09] <%Solidnick18> erron is very good
[1:36:10] <CerberusDriver> ugh, red sub zero is wack
[1:36:16] <%HDmexiqtioner> Ye Haw?
[1:36:16] <yuribo26> I miss old Erron Black... with the awful animations
[1:36:20] <%HDmexiqtioner> Nope not now.

[1:36:23] <+jetjagger222> yeah cool stage
[1:36:27] <SnaKemuho> erron is too good now
[1:36:28] <%linkwolf4> look at this RED ASS ICEMAN
[1:36:29] <+jetjagger222> we westworld now
[1:36:31] <CerberusDriver> seeing scorpion/sub zero not with yellow or blue is super wack
[1:36:33] <%juxtest> Lol Blood Zero
[1:36:41] <yuribo26> Kotal Jobber Pog
[1:36:47] <NumberTooBig> @JayEarly doesnt he have one where he forces you to do Ms Fortune's super

[1:37:02] <yuribo26> Does MK11 still use variations?
[1:37:03] <fluke_LKZ> Someone got fired for that blunder
[1:37:03] <CptBritches> Zero sub for subzero
[1:37:13] <+LastHazzerd> Reggie gettin good with SubZ
[1:37:25] <thebiggityboogity> kotal looks like a 90s mascot for fruit punch
[1:37:43] <Kalcom> Total Krahp
[1:37:51] <sappinmahbinyot> Kotal relies on his godpunch for combos i thinm.
[1:38:12] <jubejube56> @sappinmahbinyot if you had a godpunch wouldn't you?
[1:38:18] <sappinmahbinyot> @jubejube56 Hell yeah
[1:38:21] <JayEarly> @numbertoobig not too familiar with Skullgirls
[1:38:26] <JoeyStar> the stages in this game are so good
[1:38:32] <+LastHazzerd> his totems are part of his animations but not moves
[1:38:45] <sappinmahbinyot> Kotal legit has better everything than shao kahn jsut gonna point that out again
[1:38:56] <jubejube56> @LastHazzerd wasn't there a mechanic for stacking totem buffs?
[1:39:03] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> RIP "On your knees!"
[1:39:04] <%Solidnick18> huh
[1:39:08] <+TricycleWarlord> Yep, he has buff totems.
[1:39:21] <+LastHazzerd> oh wait, there's a totem
[1:39:34] <+TricycleWarlord> You have to choose them as your extra abilities.
[1:39:38] <fluke_LKZ> Do the fatal, bro
[1:39:40] <sappinmahbinyot> He has a buff that doesn't get him combo'd for free.
[1:39:42] <Storm_Samurai> @Soul_Bruce_Lee omg he doesn't say that anymore...at least he says praise the sun!
[1:39:45] <yuribo26> Kat food is the best fatality
[1:39:48] <necrocannibal2> do his second
[1:39:49] <+LastHazzerd> yeyeyeye
[1:39:50] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @solidnick18 Did Logic ease up on MK?
[1:39:58] <%jinking79> his best one
[1:39:59] <%Billyuppercut0> woolieGASM
[1:40:03] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> were you able to pause during the "finish him" sequence in MKX? I remember you couldn't in MK9 and I think that's a cool feature

[1:40:24] <@akuda_bar> nom nom
[1:40:32] <JayEarly> delicious
[1:40:43] <jubejube56> I think there is something special about the kick he does in his first fatality
[1:40:46] <+LastHazzerd> you can see them getting inserted
[1:41:01] <sappinmahbinyot> @jubejube56 it's sudden and brutal
[1:41:01] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @solidnick18 chairNinawifu
[1:41:20] <+RedMageRebel> you think kotal ever just goes cat mode and lazes in the sun

[1:42:20] <@akuda_bar> orz
[1:42:23] <+LastHazzerd> i've never actually seen that gif, just the first frame everyone uses
[1:42:26] <SnaKemuho> yeah I feel sorry about that one actually
[1:42:32] <mayorrev> @akuda_bar i can't believe you done this
[1:42:38] <NumberTooBig> wasnt this stage the factory your turned into a borg in quake
[1:42:40] <necrocannibal2> @akuda_bar jesus goddamn christ
[1:42:48] <fluke_LKZ> Yeyeye, do the fatal.
[1:42:49] <JayEarly> I’m glad that I have no clue what Akuda is talking about
[1:42:56] <+LastHazzerd> meaty
[1:42:57] <+Irridium> same
[1:42:57] <+RedMageRebel> oh god I didn't know the gif at first but it clicked
[1:43:00] <+RedMageRebel> why
[1:43:07] <sappinmahbinyot> What gif
[1:43:17] <mistersups> I feel like Fatal Blows should auto-Brutality
[1:43:19] <%coobubba> coobubba subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:43:21] <+RedMageRebel> don't, you don't want that evil

[1:43:28] <+LastHazzerd> Tournament?
[1:43:33] <+LastHazzerd> Kasual?
[1:43:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> chat someone should take a screenshot of that stage and put the first frame of that gif somewhere in the background
[1:43:47] <sappinmahbinyot> OH THAT GIF
[1:43:48] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> Create and then Forever King so y'all always get to play even when you lose
[1:43:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sappinmahbinyot LUL
[1:43:55] <sappinmahbinyot> AKUDA WHY
[1:44:01] <SnaKemuho> there are lobbies as usual @woolieversus
[1:44:03] <@akuda_bar> woolieMIRIN
[1:44:04] <reiju_22> nepSmug
[1:44:05] <Make_me_mad> I still don't know the gif and now I just feel left out.
[1:44:06] <+LastHazzerd> it's already lackluster, can't use so many cool moves
[1:44:09] <ShutenDragoon> Jax fatality 2
[1:44:10] <JayEarly> ignorance is truly bliss
[1:44:12] <ItsAGundamu> Jax
[1:44:13] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> You mean NONEXISTENT rank system?! woolieSMUG
[1:44:13] <mistersups> Make a wish
[1:44:15] <jubejube56> Dvorah spider
[1:44:18] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> jax's second fatality is strong
[1:44:19] <%coobubba> all of johnny's fatalities
[1:44:19] <@Menitta> That Scorpion one is up there...
[1:44:22] <tubeman642> Noob's inside
[1:44:22] <fluke_LKZ> What, not Kreate?
[1:44:23] <CerberusDriver> Noob's and Johnnys fatalities
[1:44:25] <fluke_LKZ> How dare they
[1:44:27] <SnaKemuho> @make_me_mad you're better off not knowing
[1:44:27] <mayorrev> the woolie hole
[1:44:30] <+RedMageRebel> Johnny's puppet one
[1:44:33] <DragonSpooker> Dvorah
[1:44:33] <kaiserred22> Kano’s Dance fatal
[1:44:33] <BigNerdSam> Heres Johnny
[1:44:36] <necrocannibal2> Kano's 2nd
[1:44:43] <+Order_of_Mystery> d'vorahs bug vomit one :)
[1:44:43] <NumberTooBig> Johnny, but only with the ninja mime outfit
[1:44:45] <%Solidnick18> join the woolie
[1:44:47] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> hot take: I like Johnny's uppercut one better than the puppet one
[1:44:48] <necrocannibal2> or D'Vorah's 2nd
[1:44:51] <+combomaniadeluxe> kano's 2nd one
[1:44:52] <+RedMageRebel> oh out of all the games? cassies Facebook one
[1:44:55] <+LastHazzerd> invasion!
[1:44:57] <@Menitta> Oh god my W/L is visible
[1:45:00] <mankeyfigh> Aight chat hop on and kick ass
[1:45:00] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[1:45:01] <Desaura> Frost 2nd fatal
[1:45:03] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> cassie's facebook one is really good
[1:45:03] <%Solidnick18> oh no
[1:45:06] <%robobeau> robobeau subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:45:24] <+rorschachsjournal505> Probably would have to go with....frost second fatal as well
[1:45:25] <J0RD4NPR1M3> Johnny's uppercut is the best in 11. Mileena's feast fatality from x is my favorite in general.
[1:45:30] <Theworld732> Do forever king
[1:45:31] <necrocannibal2> netcode in this game is great
[1:45:37] <Geassmaster5> Eww Wifi
[1:45:40] <heyitsdenzel_> Forever King?
[1:45:45] <jubejube56> I find it very strange that the characters seem to act entirely differently in fights than they do in the story mode
[1:45:47] <necrocannibal2> other fighting games should pay fucking attention
[1:45:52] <sappinmahbinyot> Johnny's puppet, johnny's takes, both of kotal's, jax's baseball and noob's body rippage one are best
[1:45:57] <NumberTooBig> @jubejube56 no shut up tho
[1:45:58] <+LastHazzerd> yeyeye, Menitta n Wool
[1:45:59] <JayEarly> WIFI WARRIORS
[1:46:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @heyitsdenzel_ it's a KotH match where the king is the same no matter who wins or loses. great for streams
[1:46:08] <jubejube56> like cassie and johnny feel like cartoon characters compared to the story
[1:46:12] <Theworld732> Forever king would be ideal for this
[1:46:14] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Oh hey! I'm in time for one of these!
[1:46:17] <Geassmaster5> ethernet master race
[1:46:18] <%Solidnick18> alright menitta
[1:46:21] <+combomaniadeluxe> I've never seen a fighting game give you the odds of you wining =. Thats weird
[1:46:28] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @J0RD4NPR1M3 I like any fatalities where the person gets cut in half and crawls away. That's just so gross and seems so painful
[1:46:35] <+LastHazzerd> Woolie shut up, it is the best Noob voice
[1:46:38] <wolvenelf> ok i guess you can just face whoever
[1:46:47] <+Schiz_Turtles> @WoolieVersus challenge someone to Forever King, then we'll queue to fight you next
[1:46:52] <fluke_LKZ> No shut up, Shockmaster Noob is cool
[1:46:58] <heyitsdenzel_> Cassie got the glow
[1:46:59] <Finchit> i like the last dragon reference
[1:47:03] <JayEarly> it’s hard to pick just one fatal
[1:47:04] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> @combomaniadeluxe It's stupid
[1:47:09] <NumberTooBig> its cute that Noob is trying to christian bale his voice to seem different
[1:47:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:09] <sappinmahbinyot> They better make noob say "I AM THE SHOCKMASTER" in a DLC intro i swear to god.
[1:47:23] <CerberusDriver> Woolie will come around on Noob's voice, Woolie thought Crimson Cloud was a bad song originally too
[1:47:34] <JayEarly> gun to my head: D’vorah’s The Thing fatality
[1:47:43] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Noob already says a lot of meme stuff
[1:47:45] <jubejube56> Nobody is going to come around on Noob's voice
[1:47:50] <+LastHazzerd> cuz Noob is a dork who thinks he is cool
[1:47:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> hot take: Crimson Cloud is a better song than Devil Trigger
[1:48:01] <jubejube56> we are going to do a rate the voice 4 years from now and it will age poorly
[1:48:08] <TheValiantBob> Noob literally says I am become Death, Destoryer of Worlds in his arcade ending, it's the greatest
[1:48:08] <%UrsulaCat> Near far
[1:48:12] <sappinmahbinyot> Crimson Cloud is top tier
[1:48:13] <necrocannibal2> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug I agree
[1:48:15] <+RedMageRebel> who is his shadow goo man supposed to be; kid me always thought it was a different character in like deception and shit
[1:48:16] <sappinmahbinyot> D:
[1:48:19] <%UrsulaCat> Whereeeeeever you are
[1:48:20] <NumberTooBig> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug hot take on a month's old game
[1:48:26] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> crimson cloud is just a great song
[1:48:32] <Theworld732> Noobs second variation is better for combos
[1:48:34] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> also geez DMCV is totally a month old isn't it
[1:48:34] <+LastHazzerd> i've loved noob's voice since i first heard it on inspector gadget
[1:48:35] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> time flies
[1:48:36] <+Alpha_Druid> @RedMageRebel the first subzero
[1:48:37] <%Solidnick18> dah
[1:48:37] <+Order_of_Mystery> nep, its not a hot take if its right
[1:48:41] <@Menitta> GG
[1:48:44] <JayEarly> Hotter take: The new version of Subhuman is actually good
[1:48:44] <sappinmahbinyot> @redmagerebel Just a clone. In deception he was Smoke under the lin kuei's cyberization program.
[1:48:45] <heyitsdenzel_> Deathly Hollows Nob
[1:48:47] <TigerFlavoredCereal> looks like we ain't getting demonitized yet
[1:48:48] <businesscasualninja> start a King of the Hill dood

[1:48:55] <mankeyfigh> F
[1:48:57] <+LastHazzerd> Koins~
[1:49:01] <SnaKemuho> @woolieversus you should switch to Forever King mode
[1:49:02] <+Alpha_Druid> @RedMageRebel oh wait you mean the actual klone
[1:49:02] <NumberTooBig> but yeah i still prefer DMC 4's music in battle instead of Devil trigger
[1:49:03] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @NumberTooBig I just thought "hot take" meant controversial take, not that it had to be for something recent
[1:49:11] <+combomaniadeluxe> So does everyone call Noob noob in game or do they just call him Bi-han?
[1:49:11] <fluke_LKZ> Ka$h Ka4h Ka$h
[1:49:20] <NumberTooBig> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug they went over it on the podcast
[1:49:22] <necrocannibal2> there are five different currencies in this game.
[1:49:24] <Theworld732> You should play forever king
[1:49:26] <CerberusDriver> sub zero calls him bihan
[1:49:30] <TheValiantBob> hot take, but I hate how one of Noob's customization items is on the clone. it clashes so much with the solid black aesthetic the clone has
[1:49:31] <%UrsulaCat> Menni ftw
[1:49:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm coming for ya woolie
[1:49:41] <+RedMageRebel> Ahh, gotcha. yeah I always thought it was a seperate character from bi-han
[1:49:49] <businesscasualninja> IM IN THERE
[1:49:54] <necrocannibal2> how's the netcode
[1:49:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @NumberTooBig I haven't listened to the most recent podcast yet I'm a fraud I'm sorry NotLikeThis
[1:49:58] <Geassmaster5> if they are ethernet
[1:49:59] <necrocannibal2> what do you think of it
[1:50:00] <+JohnXuandou> NRS has rollback netcode don't forget
[1:50:01] <%wujak> why is woolie on wifi
[1:50:03] <+LastHazzerd> see there it is "The not real"
[1:50:06] <%Solidnick18> i love that liu skin
[1:50:11] <+LastHazzerd> the best things in this game are "not real"
[1:50:12] <sappinmahbinyot> Hot take, i kinda want to stick my finger in noob's burnt nose hole
[1:50:19] <JayEarly> uh
[1:50:20] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> The netcode in this game is really good
[1:50:27] <JayEarly> takes all sorte
[1:50:27] <jubejube56> @sappinmahbinyot hey no kink shaming here
[1:50:28] <%linkwolf4> lytYIKES lytHALT

[1:51:01] <fluke_LKZ> He also rejected this match
[1:51:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus how to join your lobby
[1:51:02] <JayEarly> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug you know you’re gonna have her baby right
[1:51:03] <Madbearv> i'm here to watch woolie get boddied
[1:51:05] <NumberTooBig> man, its a shame the game's a full 100 bucks if its only good for netplay Kappa
[1:51:08] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> oh god, we're using the kompetitive variations? shotoEww
[1:51:10] <jonlambert0001> F for that konnection
[1:51:11] <JoeyStar> aw yeah

[1:51:17] <DragonSpooker> doodFps
[1:51:17] <T_Sasquatch> 238ms LUL
[1:51:21] <T_Sasquatch> you guys
[1:51:24] <+RedMageRebel> kung lao always gonna be my favorite shaolin monk
[1:51:26] <+RayDaug> Are they on PS4 or PC?
[1:51:27] <SnaKemuho> @jayearly as if that's a bad thing
[1:51:31] <%wolfofsound> Antarctic ping
[1:51:31] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> I mean, it wasn't the game's fault
[1:51:44] <Animal_Farm4> Why not just do Forever King?
[1:51:50] <sappinmahbinyot> kung lao is so cool in this game
[1:51:53] <mankeyfigh> If your ping is good, you get to play
[1:51:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> can someone tell me the room name
[1:52:02] <jubejube56> woolie
[1:52:02] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @JayEarly I'd be 100% fine with dying to some messed up cross between a chest burster and John Carpenter's "The Thing" because I'm pretty sure the sex would be amazing
[1:52:07] <+jishjoshjash> I'm openin' up MK. Does the room have a password?
[1:52:19] <+RedMageRebel> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug with dvora?
[1:52:21] <sappinmahbinyot> He was sooo fucking ugly in mk9 though. Looked like male sheeva. Not goro, just male sheeva.
[1:52:21] <JayEarly> yes what is the room?
[1:52:24] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @RedMageRebel yea
[1:52:30] <+chrishnaw> !uptime
[1:52:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 52 minutes
[1:52:31] <Madbearv> he's so fucking cool
[1:52:33] <+McSoliace> @WoolieVersus there is a streamer specific mode
[1:52:34] <+universboy95> He dies off screen I think
[1:52:35] <jubejube56> pretty sure the room was Woolie
[1:52:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> For a game called "Mortal Kombat", death is surprisingly temporary in the lore
[1:52:38] <+Irridium> no password just look for the room named "woolie"
[1:52:44] <+RedMageRebel> dude she'd spit maggots on ya dick, no thank you
[1:52:51] <NumberTooBig> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug no one truly dies Kappa
[1:53:00] <jubejube56> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug well no ones ever really gone
[1:53:05] <JetpackMcQuack> “Its Mortal Kombat” -quote of the night
[1:53:07] <sappinmahbinyot> "Don't fuck with me, I have the power of a thunder god AND anime on my side."
[1:53:07] <transporterthesequel> PRAISE the Sun!
[1:53:08] <wolvenelf> no reggie
[1:53:14] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Liu Kang has died what like 4 times now or something
[1:53:19] <Make_me_mad> Hardly anyone even dies in mortal kombat. They beat people up in this game and then just leave them sitting around and don't even take prisoners.
[1:53:20] <NumberTooBig> also timey wimey BS
[1:53:28] <jubejube56> not including timelines he probably died more
[1:53:30] <+RedMageRebel> yeah timelines man
[1:53:34] <justinol08> y
[1:53:40] <+RedMageRebel> it's better than I wanna say 4
[1:53:41] <+wardenofwinter> What system is Woolie playing on? I’m assuming ps4.
[1:53:49] <%wolfofsound> looks like a ps4 controller
[1:53:53] <mayorrev> GET OVER HERE
[1:53:53] <justinol08> im iron man
[1:54:06] <+RedMageRebel> johnny dies and its a big deal but he comes back in the same game cause of realms merging
[1:54:11] <+McSoliace> Jax is stupid good in this game
[1:54:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:11] <mistergrim07> *snap* @justinol08
[1:54:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm in the lobby, yay, more beating woolie on stream
[1:54:22] <mayorrev> Max tested out the Switch version and it ran not great\
[1:54:22] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> also Shao Kahn has died and come back like 5 times now
[1:54:28] <+LastHazzerd> Wake uppercut
[1:54:36] <%wolfofsound> @mayorrev not surprised
[1:54:39] <justinol08> did you watch endgame
[1:54:41] <+Order_of_Mystery> is reptile dead?
[1:54:47] <CerberusDriver> Kotal is bad in this game rn
[1:54:49] <mistergrim07> yesterday
[1:54:49] <@Menitta> Mashing for Target combos will never feel natural to me
[1:54:50] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Demonitized boys
[1:54:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainSagit is back
[1:54:54] <+RedMageRebel> I love my switch but it's a mobile indie game machine and not much else
[1:54:54] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @justinol08 pat and woolie did a spoiler cast of it which you can watch on the youtube right now
[1:54:55] <jubejube56> @Order_of_Mystery worse he is a jumpscare now
[1:54:57] <life404> o___o
[1:55:00] <SnaKemuho> reptile is in the krypt and you can smack him
[1:55:06] <bendatron> @justinol08 they just put up the spoiler cast on the channel today
[1:55:09] <+LastHazzerd> "oh it's the bad one"
[1:55:11] <sappinmahbinyot> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug six times if you count his competitive viability Kappa
[1:55:11] <heyitsdenzel_> Reptile is in krypt
[1:55:11] <JJenesis> gg Thanks you for the match, don't remember the good one
[1:55:15] <Rexwarrior1> no we just say *snap* whenever we feel like it here
[1:55:16] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus how does he still have a spine? LUL
[1:55:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sappinmahbinyot LUL
[1:55:19] <APB_Harleqyn> So who will be the first to MERCY???
[1:55:28] <NumberTooBig> @wolfofsound no shut up tho
[1:55:30] <+ssulcer> Wow Max, you get a tan?
[1:55:37] <%wolfofsound> @NumberTooBig Kappa
[1:55:38] <shadowpunk101> This fatality wqould be sick if he just sliced thru his exposed spine samurai style. Then slwoly seath the sword
[1:55:38] <+Order_of_Mystery> yay, i like reptile
[1:55:42] <+LastHazzerd> @wolfofsound Bone is harder to burn than flesh
[1:55:42] <%linkwolf4> @wolfofsound fuck you that's how
[1:55:44] <Rexwarrior1> bone burns less?
[1:55:44] <+Alpha_Druid> reggie make sure to ex slide at the end of your combos
[1:56:00] <+unclekulikov> Hey FGC its me, ya boi
[1:56:13] <%Wool> If you have accessibility active, you can press the PS button and square to zoom in
[1:56:15] <JetpackMcQuack> How many fatalities do you have to memorize to be considered professional?
[1:56:15] <SnaKemuho> just do the Forever King
[1:56:25] <mistergrim07> all
[1:56:35] <jubejube56> @JetpackMcQuack depends on whether or not you care about being exposed as a fraud
[1:56:37] <reiju_22> 4
[1:56:38] <+Alpha_Druid> all the brutals too
[1:56:40] <NumberTooBig> @JetpackMcQuack none, just mercy Kappa
[1:56:47] <alphajiggly> !followage
[1:56:47] <+Eureka_seveN77> I wasn't expecting woolie's ping to not be great
[1:56:48] <heyitsdenzel_> Forever King Woolie
[1:56:49] <+Eureka_seveN77> mine's lower
[1:57:03] <+McSoliace> time to be exposed
[1:57:16] <%Wool> Try pressing PS button and square to zoom in to see names, Woolie
[1:57:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @jubejube56 noobs do fatalities every round, "pros" just punch the person and pause/rematch, *real* pros do fatalities every round
[1:57:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> it's a bell curve
[1:57:33] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> or I guess a sine wave. I don't know, I'm bad at math
[1:57:37] <Dapper_Cactuar> Cetrion can also do some cool combo stuff, but she's mainly used for zoning
[1:57:38] <jubejube56> a parabola
[1:57:44] <@Menitta> Kneecappin is good
[1:57:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> sure lets go with parabola
[1:57:50] <life404> holy
[1:57:58] <TigerFlavoredCereal> F L A W L E S S
[1:58:02] <@akuda_bar> it's like poetry, it rhymes
[1:58:04] <sappinmahbinyot> Cetrion looks like she's gonna have a terrrible matchup against characters like noob and geras
[1:58:05] <mistergrim07> perfect
[1:58:06] <+LurkerGene> monkaS
[1:58:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i got here like, 5 minutes ago, who is your guest?
[1:58:11] <alphajiggly> No one likes someone that corners
[1:58:15] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Soul_Bruce_Lee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! !!!
[1:58:20] <jubejube56> real pros do often live long enough to see themselves become noobs again
[1:58:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> !!!

[1:58:53] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @jubejube56 the student knows he doesn't have to do a fatality every round, the master knows he totally can tho
[1:58:54] <+McSoliace> exposed on stream gg

[1:59:50] <heyitsdenzel_> Ex slide Reggie
[1:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:51] <+RedMageRebel> Is old man sub-zero dilf territory?
[1:59:51] <jubejube56> best girl?

[2:00:11] <SchlongKongEduardo> how do non clashing projectiles affect zoning
[2:00:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus does shao kahn have any good normals/buttons?
[2:00:18] <kakdela7> where is rain?
[2:00:18] <ZeeJiggle> Is Noob's shadow just his hype man stand?
[2:00:19] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Liu Kang and his friends are revenants at the start of the game
[2:00:21] <JoeyStar> is D’vorah any good in this game?
[2:00:22] <+Debuggingfool> @kbizzle_05 scorpion I'd say has some easy inputs and a teleport
[2:00:23] <xvstheworld> Don’t forget to stay hydrated, apparently
[2:00:23] <JetpackMcQuack> The game looks like it tries to be the same pace as the old games, is that the case? @woolieversus
[2:00:24] <bendatron> @holidayMD 52 kard
[2:00:29] <%Wool> @WoolieVersus If you press PS button+Square, you can zoom in
[2:00:30] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Liu Kang, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero are good starting characters
[2:00:37] <Gutsandlove> Anything a should now about Dvorah? gonna main her, dont have the game yet
[2:00:38] <%wujak> @WoolieVersus why are you on wifi and not lan
[2:00:42] <NumberTooBig> fuck those guys who preordered LUL
[2:00:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> noooo
[2:00:42] <J0RD4NPR1M3> What is your opinion on the custom moves? Max like prefers them so much he never plays ranked.
[2:00:42] <CerberusDriver> >shao kahn bottom
[2:00:44] <T_Sasquatch> LUL preorder character is bottom tier
[2:00:45] <CerberusDriver> what is happening
[2:00:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> my big boi.
[2:00:51] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus I've been playing Jacqui, but she seems to have no tools to get in in her ranked variations. Any tips for getting in on zoners without teleports to do the job for me? Also, is Jacqui good generally or should I try someone else?
[2:00:51] <%juxtest> Hows Kabal?
[2:00:53] <T_Sasquatch> Thats too hilarious
[2:00:55] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> I got thrashed by a Shao Kahn the other day
[2:00:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> that hurts
[2:00:57] <+LastHazzerd> you unlock him in story mode right?
[2:00:58] <+Gooniekorn> Whats my game plan with Jax besides just throw them
[2:01:00] <jubejube56> sup
[2:01:03] <@Menitta> Frost is so cool in this
[2:01:03] <T_Sasquatch> @LastHazzerd fuck no
[2:01:06] <Toastyrific> Kabal seems fun, how would you rank him?
[2:01:10] <Sn0hell> @WoolieVersus thoughts on character that doesn't require a lot of timing in his combos ?
[2:01:13] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Gutsandlove one of the intro dialogues between her and koatl implies they fucked. Don't know how that will help you main her, but you definitely needed to know that
[2:01:13] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:01:15] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Nope! Only preorder. Or else 6 bucks
[2:01:24] <sappinmahbinyot> Everything is slow, all of his damage is outdone by people who are safer, most of his damage is tied to extremely slow low duration buffs that you will literally get punished for using
[2:01:29] <@Menitta> Oh! This is @Solidus_113!

[2:01:54] <Gutsandlove> Good to know
[2:01:57] <sappinmahbinyot> In theory he can deal good damage but there is no way at all in whicb you'll get it practically.
[2:01:58] <+jetjagger222> miku frost

[2:02:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, other question, thoughts on "supposed" dlc leak if you want to talk about it
[2:02:14] <+Order_of_Mystery> the best thing about shao are his fatalities, lol
[2:02:15] <T_Sasquatch> look how they massacred my boy
[2:02:19] <CerberusDriver> woolie didnt give this guy anything lmao
[2:02:22] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[2:02:23] <+Eureka_seveN77> probably gonna drop out of the room after seeing this match
[2:02:24] <Dapper_Cactuar> @WoolieVersus who do you think are the characters most friendly to people new to fighting games outside of Scorp and Sub?
[2:02:26] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:02:30] <@Menitta> YOU BLEW IT @Solidus_113
[2:02:32] <CptBritches> Poor Solidus

[2:02:57] <%linkwolf4> shoutout to the intro where cassie calls frost Elsa and frost asks "why does every one keep calling me that?"
[2:03:01] <+Tsantiago1> I hope woolie has Noob's AI Bot ready for tower farming doodBait
[2:03:04] <Impulsive3> this xbox or ps4
[2:03:11] <%QueequegTheater> Skarlet tho Kreygasm
[2:03:13] <NumberTooBig> @JetpackMcQuack that its slow and everyone controls like a sack of bricks LUL
[2:03:17] <+The_monster_hunter> Kotal is what I've been liking the most
[2:03:18] <T_Sasquatch> wait how the fuck does frost have a skull and spinal cord when she is just a head 🤔
[2:03:23] <SnaKemuho> @t_sasquatch didn't block, roll or use fast normals
[2:03:24] <Gutsandlove> @WoolieVersus any Dvorah tips?
[2:03:28] <%juxtest> Surprisingly little robot in Frost
[2:03:35] <+SgtCrunch> Kotal is a blast to play
[2:03:39] <TigerFlavoredCereal> you see that video where sonicfox calls sonya a terf
[2:03:39] <%QueequegTheater> Also his balls
[2:03:40] <sappinmahbinyot> @t_sasquatch What the fuck?
[2:03:42] <ameraaaaaa> hey hows time guy
[2:03:42] <jubejube56> @T_Sasquatch because concistency
[2:03:43] <NumberTooBig> but seriously, hows the wavedashing work, tekken or melee
[2:03:45] <+BroLASco> geras is pretty strong right now
[2:03:49] <Javipuff> go Geras to win
[2:03:52] <+bobfriskit> does Kotal have good dmg output?
[2:03:53] <sappinmahbinyot> That's so fucking
[2:03:54] <DragonSpooker> @woolieversus Will you guys be playing the story or will that be on the channel later?
[2:04:00] <mistersups> What's the Trash Game tonight?
[2:04:01] <sappinmahbinyot> @bobfriskit yes
[2:04:02] <T_Sasquatch> @sappinmahbinyot what ?
[2:04:08] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus Can I get a runback on that Frost match with custom variations allowed. NotLikeThis
[2:04:16] <%QueequegTheater> But why would i siwtch off of skarlet
[2:04:17] <sappinmahbinyot> @t_sasquatch Just that it's bizarre.
[2:04:21] <T_Sasquatch> @SnaKemuho 🤔 you're probably right
[2:04:23] <ameraaaaaa> what's woolie's special moves
[2:04:24] <%SodiusChubz> SodiusChubz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:04:30] <+LastHazzerd> are you ever gonna look at the non-tourney move possibilities? or would that be a waste of time
[2:04:38] <%UrsulaCat> Stay noided
[2:04:39] <NumberTooBig> @ameraaaaaa consult the guacamelee mod
[2:04:40] <T_Sasquatch> @sappinmahbinyot you didn't know ? LUL frost is cyber lin kuei bby
[2:04:44] <%ChoculaUltra> knowing what your opponent's character can do is like 60% of competitive play
[2:04:50] <Jacksonx621> @woolieversus What do you think about Raiden? Is he strong?
[2:04:54] <Superblooms> @WoolieVersus how fast are you pressing the combo buttons? i have a hard time doing strings cause i feel like i'm going to quickly.
[2:04:57] <mayorrev> BACK TO THE LAB AGAIN
[2:04:59] <CerberusDriver> I thought Shao Kahn was trash tho
[2:05:09] <+SvenHolgersson> But what if I just don't learn and get angry
[2:05:16] <sappinmahbinyot> @t_sasquatch I know it's just eeird to see her head and artificial spine being jnserted and then the cassie fatality. Just made me wtf
[2:05:16] <Kalcom> "worst "
[2:05:17] <+SvenHolgersson> Cuz thats my goto plan
[2:05:29] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:05:30] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @SvenHolgersson then someone screencaps your chat logs and puts them on the scrubquotesX twitter naroSmug
[2:05:36] <NumberTooBig> @SvenHolgersson uninstall?
[2:05:38] <J0RD4NPR1M3> The ranked variations are so lame and having to pick them in tournament makes the others pretty pointless
[2:05:40] <SnaKemuho> it's much closer to 9
[2:05:42] <+asperger_mode> shao khum rules
[2:05:49] <jubejube56> wields a giant hammer...command grab character
[2:05:50] <+asperger_mode> uppercut all day
[2:05:57] <wolvenelf> lmao
[2:05:58] <%ChoculaUltra> @SvenHolgersson you focus your anger into blinding hot hatred and learn to play the game only to make people feel like you are.
[2:05:59] <@Menitta> WOOL
[2:06:02] <Sn0hell> @WoolieVersus thoughts on characters that don't require a lot of timing with their combos but the combos still looks stylish ?
[2:06:16] <mistersups> Whose another MK character from the 3D generation who you want to come back?
[2:06:17] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Shao Kahn is bad rite Kappa
[2:06:19] <%SodiusChubz> hows it goin
[2:06:20] <T_Sasquatch> Bottom tier chracter 🤔 Kappa
[2:06:22] <CerberusDriver> shao kahn is trash tho
[2:06:24] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> "shao kahn is the worst character in the game" *loses to the first Shao Kahn he plays*

[2:11:50] <CptBritches> That's why we come here
[2:11:51] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Woolie is figuring it out
[2:12:08] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus Also Woolie, you might like to give Jacqui a try. She's got some good punchgirl stuff going on.
[2:12:08] <jubejube56> the troubleshooting is basically my queue for a bathroom break
[2:12:12] <Tearlesskingpy> Is Johnny Cage any good? :)
[2:12:13] <NumberTooBig> i know you said it while the mic's cut off doodGlare1 doodGlare2
[2:12:16] <+HollywoodH3ro> I am downloading this game right now. It’s my first mortal kombat game ever. Who do you suggest as a starting character?
[2:12:19] <+LastHazzerd> Mirror matches with different variations is interesting
[2:12:26] <SnaKemuho> yeah Jacqui is basically DMC Balrog
[2:12:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Good thing we were here to shout for 2 minutes straight :)
[2:12:32] <@Solidus_113> what's the difference between Input Window Timing in the control options? @WoolieVersus

[2:13:08] <T_Sasquatch> @HollywoodH3ro you're better off trying out every character then picking who you like
[2:13:09] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus How is Scarlet? Is she any good?
[2:13:10] <TigerFlavoredCereal> g o t t e m
[2:13:10] <mayorrev> :doodbait:
[2:13:10] <Theworld732> What when how
[2:13:13] <Finchit> oh yeah i heard woolie talking shit
[2:13:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> AND KILLER INSTINCT
[2:13:18] <sappinmahbinyot> @hollywoodh3ro baraka is pretty good if you're ok with having a bit of trouble with zoners compared to teleporters. He got crazy pressure, easy combos, some of the highest damage in the game.
[2:13:20] <+JrSpore> they suck at challenge 300 tho :P
[2:13:21] <ManOfReason> HOLD THAT TO YOUR CHEST
[2:13:28] <mankeyfigh> @woolieversus thought I was deaf for a moment there bruv

[2:13:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i wish ferra/tor or goro was back
[2:13:41] <%robobeau> I tried out Jacqui but Jax is so much more fun
[2:13:42] <Smileyhat> Fair enough. She's got some cool skins.
[2:13:42] <TigerFlavoredCereal> T I M E C R Y S T A L S
[2:13:49] <+DeathGodSkeith> SHOW WOOLIE THE LONG HAIRED JACQUI OUTFIT @WoolieVersus
[2:13:50] <+universboy95> He alternate costumes are some of the best in the game.
[2:14:02] <sappinmahbinyot> Jacqui's skins are sooo much better than default
[2:14:06] <Theworld732> Her idle stance is a Muay Thai stance like sagat kinda
[2:14:07] <Kalcom> remember woolie is a race traitor
[2:14:09] <NumberTooBig> @CaptainPileDriver just for the little guy to run around for the whole match, no way Kappa
[2:14:13] <life404> bring stryker back :(

[2:14:57] <+jishjoshjash> @WoolieVersus You can scroll down in the room list, there's like 10 other people in here.
[2:14:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus when you get through the people i'm down for a free win from you

[2:15:09] <mankeyfigh> YOOOOOOO He’s IN
[2:15:10] <+HollywoodH3ro> Cool cool. I am excited. I will probably going to try out the basics characters first and get a feel for the controls
[2:15:14] <T_Sasquatch> i play on wifi and i've almost never had issues with ping in a fighting game

[2:15:52] <SnaKemuho> @woolieversus just switch the mode to Forever King

[2:16:19] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:16:22] <%ChoculaUltra> oh no, Reggie's Mangekyou Sharingan is growing too powerful.
[2:16:24] <ShutenDragoon> That feel when woolie scrolls past you 4 times lytCRYA
[2:16:25] <+jishjoshjash> If your ping is above 60, Woolie ain't got eyes for you.
[2:16:26] <NumberTooBig> i have fine wifi but i can never trust it wont cut out, gonna make up for lost netplay time after i hook a 60 ft ethernet doodWesker
[2:16:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Sneax7 wow spoilers dude
[2:16:36] <mankeyfigh> 250 matches? LUL
[2:16:36] <+Schiz_Turtles> how do you turn off other players audio in this? some dude was just blasting trap music lol
[2:16:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, if shao kahn is bottom of bottom tier, whose the seond worst?
[2:16:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Im in an apartment, wifi is hell
[2:16:56] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie eyesight lore
[2:16:59] <+Sneax7> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug the hell? pepole haven't finished this?
[2:17:04] <Kalcom> woolie's 20/20
[2:17:07] <@Menitta> Don't spoil the friggin story...
[2:17:11] <+LastHazzerd> @Schiz_Turtles i think you have to go through the console's system
[2:17:12] <+TricycleWarlord> man the lobby being alphabetical sucks, at the bottom lobosMindBlank
[2:17:23] <SnaKemuho> D'Vorah is probably bottom, unless they fixed her frame data
[2:17:24] <jubejube56> wasn't max playing raiden?
[2:17:24] <+Schiz_Turtles> @LastHazzerd gross, thanks
[2:17:26] <mankeyfigh> WEEEBS
[2:17:31] <T_Sasquatch> Its pronounced RAY DIN
[2:17:35] <NumberTooBig> can we talk about the actor's contracts tho Kappa
[2:17:36] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @TricycleWarlord time to change your name to !!!tricyclewarlord so that you can get to the top every time
[2:17:38] <Impulsive3> LMAO RYEDEN?
[2:17:42] <+RayDaug> Are they playing on PS4?
[2:17:45] <T_Sasquatch> not Ry-din REEE
[2:17:46] <life404> enemigo
[2:17:47] <%ChoculaUltra> Max has been labbin' Raiden if you're into combo craftin'.
[2:17:48] <+LastHazzerd> @Schiz_Turtles sorry, your welcome~
[2:17:48] <+Irridium> reggie why
[2:17:53] <mankeyfigh> I just don’t like Raiden
[2:17:54] <ameraaaaaa> s
[2:17:56] <T_Sasquatch> Rydin is in mgs
[2:17:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> YES
[2:17:58] <+LastHazzerd> get Reggied
[2:18:06] <+Irridium> sbfpDattebayo
[2:18:07] <WolfDogF> GO ARTHUR MORGIN!!
[2:18:18] <sappinmahbinyot> Erron is super good
[2:18:29] <%UrsulaCat> Reggie would do that to me
[2:18:31] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> @woolieversus How do you guys feel about the custom variations? Max doesn't play ranked at all because of them and even SonicFox seems to prefer them.
[2:18:32] <NumberTooBig> look, theres Raiden from MGS, and Rayden from MK Kappa
[2:18:32] <ameraaaaaa> do you have the rewind move
[2:18:42] <Smart_ZaK1> Reptile milking lore
[2:18:47] <%ChoculaUltra> I like to imagine Erron and Reptile are cool and Reptile just vomits into jars for him.
[2:18:47] <+LastHazzerd> cowboys in westerns have used snake venom as weapons so it fits, despite what folk say
[2:18:51] <RICE02> i wanna see the fanart of Erron milking Reptile Kappa
[2:18:51] <+Order_of_Mystery> erron milked reptile... thats kinky
[2:19:02] <%yeknomlive> max was playing a little bit of ranked last night
[2:19:02] <%robobeau> Yo @woolieversus and the gang, I have to know... what awful pun are y'all planning to use for your character variation? I got "Ice To Meet You" for my Sub-Zero Kappa
[2:19:05] <%UrsulaCat> Not kinky enough
[2:19:12] <jubejube56> @J0RD4NPR1M3 seems weird to make a game that gameplay-wise is seemingly designed for competative play, then make a bunch of moves that will never be seen competatively
[2:19:19] <%UrsulaCat> GIVE US THE OVIPOSITOR
[2:19:22] <NumberTooBig> i forget, does Erron still flail around like a wimp in this game LUL
[2:19:31] <Superblooms> geras is broken?
[2:19:32] <SnaKemuho> cuz they're both too good compared to other characters
[2:19:50] <ScreamingMeat> I don't like how battle damage no longer shows up on character models
[2:19:52] <+SpaceIndian> @jubejube56 supposedly theyll be tweaking current tournament presets and making more in the future
[2:19:56] <%ChoculaUltra> I got waxed by a Noob Saibot using the "Kage Bunshin" variation name. I turned off the PS4 for the night after that.
[2:19:57] <%Solidnick18> dropkick forever
[2:20:08] <mankeyfigh> Why am I rooting against Woolie rn
[2:20:10] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus How does Skarlet stack up? She was fun in MK9.
[2:20:14] <bendatron> @WoolieVersus ggs
[2:20:18] <ameraaaaaa> my dad says hin
[2:20:20] <life404> so sick
[2:20:21] <NumberTooBig> he's fine
[2:20:22] <+LastHazzerd> style
[2:20:24] <@Menitta> This is the best freaking fatal blow
[2:20:24] <life404> xD
[2:20:28] <@Menitta> Hands down
[2:20:28] <Smileyhat> Best variation pun I've got so far is "Leg Day" for Jacqui.
[2:20:30] <GreatestGuess> Dropkick is only barely unsafe for some reason, most people only get a punish in the corner
[2:20:36] <ameraaaaaa> i mean hi
[2:20:36] <ELJOVENBATALI> I GOT THE HORSES IN THE BACK
[2:20:36] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> why the meh fatal?
[2:20:40] <life404> holy
[2:20:42] <+LastHazzerd> the BOOT
[2:20:43] <%Gamefriendly> wait @WoolieVersus why is geras broken?
[2:20:45] <%yeknomlive> his other one is better
[2:20:47] <+Zenyatta> American History X :(
[2:20:49] <+Order_of_Mystery> aww yeah, reptile milk!
[2:20:49] <mayorrev> ACID BOTTLE
[2:20:52] <Smileyhat> I wanted to make a Cetrion variation called "For Those About to Rock" but it was too long.
[2:20:53] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> @jubejube56 Then why even make them? I think having them is more interesting because it invites more creativity and versatility.
[2:20:54] <+LastHazzerd> his other one IS better
[2:20:57] <NumberTooBig> HIS FOOT WutFace
[2:21:10] <%UrsulaCat> SHOW FOOT
[2:21:14] <@Menitta> Awww
[2:21:16] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Smileyhat I saw one where the guy's variation was named "Hot Dang, it's" and he was playing Liu Kang
[2:21:18] <%yeknomlive> who were they saying is worst?
[2:21:20] <FatDragonQuest> I'd argue Baraka
[2:21:29] <+CrackPebbles> dvorah is the only character sonic considers bad right now
[2:21:30] <Smileyhat> Nice
[2:21:35] <extradopeness> Yoooo
[2:21:39] <+JrSpore> i heard baraka is goo
[2:21:40] <NumberTooBig> @yeknomlive the preorder character formerly known as Shao Kahn
[2:21:58] <+LastHazzerd> good username for a bug queen
[2:22:15] <JoeyStar> ah that bums me out I hope they buff her
[2:22:16] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:22:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Irridium username on ps4 man
[2:22:28] <jubejube56> They were giving Dvorah the wrestlemania push for 2 whole story modes, only for her to fall so low
[2:22:31] <extradopeness> Hunnybee oh hunnybee there's no such thing
[2:22:34] <@Menitta> Yellow on pale eggshell
[2:22:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> holy shit i can't even read that
[2:22:41] <Theworld732> Play on forever king
[2:22:42] <%jinking79> does one Player really define a Character in a fighting game ?
[2:22:46] <jubejube56> @extradopeness the sweeter the sting?
[2:23:05] <Impulsive3> @jinking79 no
[2:23:07] <mistersups> CB is also in Chicago
[2:23:08] <ameraaaaaa> woolie that time guy has a good move that costs 3 super moves but it's worth it
[2:23:09] <extradopeness> @jubejube56 ayyyy
[2:23:12] <SnaKemuho> apparently they reverted D'Vorah and Kitana changes in the recent patch, though I haven't checked them today
[2:23:14] <NumberTooBig> @jinking79 when they accidentaly reenact an arcade ending
[2:23:15] <+CrackPebbles> midwest is all about the NRS games
[2:23:20] <life404> put_stryker_in_mk11
[2:23:22] <Kalcom> injustice is kinda hated tho
[2:23:22] <@Menitta> You'd have to make a variation for every possible combination of moves for every character, potentially
[2:23:42] <mankeyfigh> @woolieversus what about Johnny Cage
[2:23:43] <%jinking79> Thank chat
[2:23:48] <+LastHazzerd> maybe just... better varients for tourny then?
[2:23:48] <+McSoliace> yes
[2:23:52] <%mzrx7> didn't they patch that out?
[2:23:57] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> it was censored
[2:23:58] <%yeknomlive> they censored the "fuck you. in that victory taunt"
[2:23:58] <jubejube56> well doesn't he no longer swear?
[2:24:00] <+Kaito_Cam> they nerfed taht
[2:24:09] <+Kaito_Cam> he doesn't say fuck you anymore
[2:24:11] <ZeeJiggle> The actual solution is for the game to let you select your specials at the character select, but hey.
[2:24:13] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> They censored the Fuck
[2:24:21] <jubejube56> remember kids ripping people in half is okay just don't swear!
[2:24:25] <Sn0hell> johnny is sick, I just wish he was easier to combo with
[2:24:29] <NumberTooBig> we cant have kids hearing these vulger swears
[2:24:33] <DarkVinceX> can grind people to a pulp, but cant say fuck you
[2:24:34] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> kinda fucked up how they can have a bunch of blood and gore but Johnny can't say fuck
[2:24:43] <%yeknomlive> doesnt make sense cause they do say fuck in the game not cesnored
[2:24:44] <NumberTooBig> now let me do Geras's fatality real quick
[2:24:48] <+LastHazzerd> he also doesn't do the OK hand when changing his belt, but that's understandable
[2:24:48] <kakdela7> pretty sure they say fuck in story mode
[2:24:49] <thelonechris> "Fudge you, Kotal Kahn! Fudge you to heck!"
[2:24:49] <@Menitta> So Nero is not okay
[2:24:53] <Superblooms> oh wow, nobody does swear, do they...
[2:24:56] <%yeknomlive> johnny's good but he has a hard time getting in
[2:24:59] <%BaronVonWidget> BaronVonWidget subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolz. Keep on keepin' on.
[2:25:01] <DarthTaco> i think it might be to be funny cause they say it without censoring in the story
[2:25:03] <DarthTaco> iirc
[2:25:05] <T_Sasquatch> i've heard people suggest that every possible variation for every character should have a specific number and then you input it in character select 🤔
[2:25:28] <+LastHazzerd> oh it only goes on cooldown??
[2:25:28] <+Order_of_Mystery> they censor fuck, yet allow dvorrah to be that nasty? cowards
[2:25:38] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> even Kabal says "fuck that" in a Johnny intro and I think it's censored as well
[2:25:46] <T_Sasquatch> so like gera codes would be like G11 G12 G54 etc
[2:25:52] <NumberTooBig> man, those fakeout moves never seem to be useful
[2:25:55] <@Menitta> OH THIS ONE
[2:25:57] <ZeeJiggle> So y'all say it's censored, how did they censor it? Just remove it or bleeps?
[2:26:07] <life404> tha shit is too good
[2:26:07] <ZeeJiggle> 'cause if it's bleeps, bleeps can be funny.
[2:26:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus are people playing with music online through there shitty headsets the worst or is it when they also sing to it
[2:26:13] <+LastHazzerd> bless you Johnny
[2:26:15] <jubejube56> wow they bleeped that too?
[2:26:15] <thelonechris> I'm surprised they didn't blur the finger
[2:26:16] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> The actual best fatality
[2:26:20] <thegrandazzle> sooooooo goooooooood lol
[2:26:21] <ZeeJiggle> Johnny fatalities are S tier.
[2:26:30] <+Irridium> @woolieVersus ay yo gg!
[2:26:32] <sappinmahbinyot> @jubejube56 it was bleeped in beta. he's on a movie set
[2:26:36] <mankeyfigh> 10/10
[2:26:41] <+Schiz_Turtles> @CaptainPileDriver sounds like you played the same dude i did lol
[2:26:41] <@Menitta> Aww
[2:26:41] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Skarlet stacks up real good if you know what I'm saying cirGPantsu
[2:26:48] <%QueequegTheater> Skarlet is best girl tho
[2:26:55] <+CrackPebbles> they turned her from a rushdown ninja to a zoner with disjointed hitboxes
[2:26:57] <+Irridium> reggie tried to hold me back
[2:27:05] <+universboy95> Anyone know any good Skarlet players?
[2:27:12] <mankeyfigh> To be honest I’d smash all the MK11 girls
[2:27:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Schiz_Turtles yeah, some scorpion player who made me mute my tv
[2:27:17] <JoeyStar> Is there a good video series/website to learn fighting game terminology?
[2:27:22] <DarkVinceX> oh no
[2:27:24] <+Gooniekorn> LUL
[2:27:25] <NumberTooBig> @CrackPebbles someone must like Under Night Kappa
[2:27:25] <extradopeness> Go Rick Ross on em
[2:27:27] <jubejube56> @sappinmahbinyot hmm i must have imagined that not being bleeped
[2:27:28] <%Solidnick18> uhhh
[2:27:29] <SnaKemuho> LUL
[2:27:29] <mankeyfigh> Except Sonya and Frost

[2:31:43] <ManOfReason> yo actually send that to scrubquotes
[2:31:51] <@Menitta> I really want to fix Moobot to allow clips
[2:31:53] <extradopeness> Lmao
[2:31:58] <jubejube56> @mankeyfigh we have already passed that time in a fighting games lifetime
[2:32:01] <sappinmahbinyot> If sub zero can make spikes out of ice why doesn't he just make spike walls?
[2:32:02] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:32:07] <NumberTooBig> @mankeyfigh its only a rule to not skip intros in BB
[2:32:08] <mistersups> Waka Waka! Baraka
[2:32:08] <Aydarkzero> thats awesome LUL
[2:32:09] <Jdtheba> LUL
[2:32:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> chatroom if you want to talk about a move that geras uses would you say Geras' move or Geras's move
[2:32:20] <jubejube56> @sappinmahbinyot because Frost called dibs
[2:32:24] <mayorrev> @WoolieVersus Oh Wow, It's Kung Lao
[2:32:29] <+LastHazzerd> people who play the game for reals tend to skip the flare cuz they seen it
[2:32:33] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> doodSteve mine for Kitana is I Miss My Wife
[2:32:38] <+jishjoshjash> Geras's
[2:32:40] <+LastHazzerd> and they aren't trying to entertain folk
[2:32:43] <volraths_bane> Kaballin
[2:32:45] <sappinmahbinyot> @jubejube56 Wow rood. Smh frost
[2:32:53] <jubejube56> Geras' move is proper english I think
[2:32:55] <SnaKemuho> I know that Cerberus's theme from DMC3 is called that
[2:33:01] <+LastHazzerd> BM
[2:33:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus hope that clip get's on scrubquotes
[2:33:16] <NumberTooBig> can you mercy multiple times or just once
[2:33:25] <SnaKemuho> once
[2:33:27] <T_Sasquatch> tea bag em
[2:33:31] <Prism_Wing> Throwback to Animalities.
[2:33:37] <Superblooms> is there no babaility/friendship?
[2:33:50] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> Kiss of Death and Kabal's screamer are also brutalities
[2:33:52] <+Alpha_Druid> it's happend already
[2:33:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> what's the ruling for that then?
[2:33:58] <ZippyPsycho> SonicFox done it
[2:33:59] <+butch_deadlift> that happened at nlbc day 2
[2:34:00] <sappinmahbinyot> Didn't sonicfox do that already
[2:34:00] <NumberTooBig> i just hope theres a clip of someone trapping someone using mercy and they can only leave by winning or quitting
[2:34:01] <%yeknomlive> sonicfox mercied like 5 times in a tournament already
[2:34:02] <+shimarisukun> what's the point of mercy aside from flexing on them?
[2:34:04] <ZippyPsycho> Cause he's SonicFox
[2:34:09] <mankeyfigh> @woolieversus friendship?
[2:34:15] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus IIRC the person who does the mercy has a bit of time that they can act before the opponent can so sonic fox had a stream where he would mercy people with erron black and immediately fatal blow them
[2:34:21] <jubejube56> @shimarisukun um it technically unlocks stuff in the krypt
[2:34:22] <T_Sasquatch> mercy in finals , loses
[2:34:24] <%yeknomlive> evo grandinfals let's see it
[2:34:35] <T_Sasquatch> ICE COLLDDD

[2:35:29] <diGGerGO> 50 Cent
[2:35:38] <+RhymesWithWasabi> This is the old version
[2:35:42] <ItsAGundamu> this is old jax
[2:35:46] <extradopeness> It has the Stanley Cup on it
[2:35:48] <T_Sasquatch> sub zero and jax are actually homies if you watch alot of their fight intros
[2:35:49] <ItsAGundamu> he just has younger arms
[2:35:52] <+LastHazzerd> "young" jax

[2:36:32] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> can I try and challenge y'all?
[2:36:33] <@Menitta> They should be like Gamecube L/R
[2:36:39] <jubejube56> Jax could have the best fatal blow if the final hit wasn't so weak
[2:36:39] <ItsAGundamu> YES
[2:36:46] <+rorschachsjournal505> Man, in my opinion, this game has the potential being the best of the new trilogy gameplay wise as the meta grows.
[2:36:48] <+LastHazzerd> Baseball?

[2:44:30] <kakdela7> I think this noob variation is better
[2:44:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> PJSalt
[2:44:38] <mankeyfigh> @itsagundamu But she’s also hella weak
[2:44:48] <+rorschachsjournal505> Making frost into a cyber tron ninja is the smartest redesign I’ve seen for a 3D era character
[2:44:49] <+FloorBurger> apple pie on hit.
[2:44:49] <TheValiantBob> low key hope Frost wins so they can see the cyber initiative fatality
[2:44:57] <sappinmahbinyot> This noob variation is much b
[2:45:04] <Prism_Wing> So how come Frost gets to have a face? LUL
[2:45:10] <life404> still alive and kicking :)
[2:45:13] <SnaKemuho> and this Frost variation is worse than the other one
[2:45:15] <mankeyfigh> Do we have mask off Frost?
[2:45:33] <SnaKemuho> @mankeyfigh yeah but you gotta beat 3 sets of towers of time
[2:46:23] <SnaKemuho> this is not the one chief

[2:46:47] <+rorschachsjournal505> Fatality two is godlike
[2:47:31] <SnaKemuho> @mankeyfigh yeah and to access some of these towers you have to do shit like 75 fatalities AFTER unlocking that tower
[2:47:32] <+Schiz_Turtles> passed me over BibleThump
[2:47:33] <Prism_Wing> Low Clone sounds like a sick breakbeat artist.
[2:47:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> i think you could replay against some folks

[2:48:41] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> What is this Kotal skin
[2:48:59] <+Rada150> why does Kotal have omec from legends of the hidden temple on his sword
[2:49:00] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:49:04] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> this is Koatl before he became a Kahn I think
[2:49:06] <+butch_deadlift> thats how kotal looks without the body paint
[2:49:13] <+asperger_mode> BBC battle
[2:49:17] <+universboy95> Imhotep Kotal
[2:49:17] <mistersups> I wish he had Green Skin and not painted Green
[2:49:18] <T_Sasquatch> @WoolieVersus Kotal khans skin color isnt blue LUL , its war paint
[2:49:22] <Jdtheba> look at that buster sword
[2:49:23] <RICE02> thats vacation Kotal Kappa
[2:49:24] <Make_me_mad> It's just normal Kotal. The green skin is just body paint, which makes him super lame.
[2:49:28] <+Diabetic> I don't like what happens to Kotal in story mode but I love how he plays in this
[2:49:29] <+butch_deadlift> kotal is the same race as jade iirc
[2:49:37] <SnaKemuho> he jobbed even in his skin color
[2:49:54] <%QueequegTheater> KomodoHype

[2:50:46] <+rorschachsjournal505> Geras is so awesome
[2:50:58] <RICE02> the stance button is for sick dance moves
[2:51:05] <SnaKemuho> Frost's standing 1 misses punish in one stance and hits in another
[2:51:13] <sappinmahbinyot> Stance button is Bm
[2:51:21] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> Geras' fist reminds of Kratos' big dumb lion gloves

[2:52:58] <+Dirty_Double_Crosser> "Hey, uh... you into cat stuff?" - Kotal
[2:53:06] <+Sabre_Basilisk> @J0RD4NPR1M3 I'm white i can't tell black people apart cmon dude
[2:53:08] <kakdela7> MKX Kotal had concept art where he turned into a cat
[2:53:12] <kakdela7> its an old idea
[2:53:14] <+Vijuani> p sure it's a jaguar cause Aztec
[2:53:25] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S MISSING ONE SONG THO
[2:53:31] <+Rada150> it's a jaguar Osh tekk are Mayans so technically Kotal is a Latino
[2:53:32] <%SodiusChubz> why are kotal pecs so big
[2:53:40] <shlaggori> Kollector is a qt
[2:53:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mistersups
[2:53:58] <Prism_Wing> Inlike that Kung Lao actually looks like Donnie Yen now.
[2:54:03] <+Walshy796> Kollector has a cool design
[2:54:15] <%arcturusblade> Best Mortal Kombat music is the Sega Genesis version of MK2
[2:54:22] <TheTwerkinator> that says something when the movie had more memorable music lmao
[2:54:25] <SnaKemuho> Pog
[2:54:42] <%Solidnick18> wait mike ross is back?
[2:54:45] <%jinking79> good to see MikeRoss and Gootecks on twitch
[2:54:46] <@Menitta> It shouldve been Gangster's Paradise Kappa
[2:54:59] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> @rada150 He's the one that led the Mayans so he kinda made Latinos
[2:55:23] <T_Sasquatch> seriously why did they pick gangsta's paradise
[2:55:32] <%juxtest> Was that Kung Lao's Stand?
[2:55:44] <+Rada150> well it was before the spanish came to america so yes but he is outworld so they don't have the same races like earthrealm
[2:55:55] <SnaKemuho> those military guys are probably some OGs
[2:55:56] <sappinmahbinyot> @t_sasquatch Because the trailer makes you want to fucking walk in the valley of the shsadow of death.
[2:56:35] <+FloorBurger> SFV was gonna have that but they scrapped it.
[2:56:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus when's the Sonic guest character reveal since he looks like he belongs in an NRS game now
[2:56:59] <T_Sasquatch> out of every song, hell don't stop me now is an easy pick that i took a second to think of
[2:57:05] <@Menitta> Double life bars are fun but yeah
[2:57:17] <+butch_deadlift> that difference in dbfz doesnt really matter though
[2:57:28] <the1manmoshpit> thanks for the fight
[2:57:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:57:41] <tungstenviper> Guys, is it worth right now to get MK11 on pc?
[2:57:43] <+Rada150> @CaptainPileDriver after what he did at the VGA impretty sure they are going to avoid him
[2:57:45] <jubejube56> @butch_deadlift true you are always in Bardock range regardless
[2:57:57] <SnaKemuho> Gas gas gas could've been a good song, considering Sonic's Twitter page
[2:58:48] <APB_Harleqyn> Darkstalkers
[2:58:51] <TheHeroAppears> skullgirls 1v1
[2:58:51] <mistersups> KI and DarkStalkers
[2:58:55] <@Menitta> I like Killer Instinct's round transitions
[2:59:22] <SnaKemuho> @tungstenviper it's up to date now, so probably yes, if you don't have ps4
[2:59:34] <+Rada150> i wish someone would buy Darkstalkers ip im pretty sure Capcom will never touch that series again
[2:59:34] <GreatestGuess> Darkstalkers 3/Vampire Savior in particular
[2:59:43] <jubejube56> technically that is how smash works too
[2:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:56] <%arcturusblade> What do you all think about fighting games that let you move around before round start, i.e. Melty Blood
[3:00:03] <+Irridium> @tungstenviper if you don't have a PS4 sure. Just be warned the kustomize screen causes crashes. Or does for me at least.
[3:00:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus thoughts on the "leak" of the dlc characters? don't have to say the names but just thoughts on if they are real
[3:00:11] <tungstenviper> @SnaKemuho i heard there are some weird performance issues... :(
[3:00:20] <%jinking79> Free.99
[3:00:23] <sappinmahbinyot> If capcom made a nsw darkstalkers it could be worse than SFV so maybe it's a blessing they don't mess it up, too
[3:00:41] <jubejube56> @arcturusblade I say more power to ya
[3:00:49] <+FloorBurger> Kof keeps health between rounds but resets position,

[3:00:57] <tungstenviper> @Irridium yeah, i heard about that, bummer.
[3:01:05] <sappinmahbinyot> This one sucks
[3:01:06] <Jdtheba> Kung Lao is definitely inspired by donnie yen now

[3:01:43] <@Menitta> Thats....a good question

[3:01:46] <%Solidnick18> damn
[3:01:55] <RICE02> jesus never thought about that
[3:01:55] <@Menitta> I bet they do.....
[3:01:59] <+rorschachsjournal505> And Kano is really good actually. Damn fun with great animations
[3:02:01] <BrachyZoid> lunarHi Howdy
[3:02:12] <+Shastafield> 🤔
[3:02:13] <Prism_Wing> They become goo
[3:02:14] <T_Sasquatch> like animals know about hibernation
[3:02:28] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine being a caterpillar and seeing your caterbro just start cocooning himself out of nowhere out of context I'd be freaking the fuck out
[3:02:29] <+FloorBurger> They just go to sleep and wake up one day with wings.
[3:02:30] <+Order_of_Mystery> kano's headbutts are gnarly
[3:02:39] <tungstenviper> Does the Student know that he will eventually become a Master... unless he fucks up first. Same thing for caterpillars bawkThink
[3:02:39] <ManOfReason> lol wut freaky friday bro
[3:02:46] <+Milpool> experiments have shown butterflies can remember things from when they were caterpillars, even though they turn to goop in the chrysalis. Pretty neat.
[3:02:59] <T_Sasquatch> thats a really fucking good question
[3:03:00] <Laironx3> MercyWing1 PogChamp MercyWing2
[3:03:17] <+Order_of_Mystery> does the butterfly remember being a caterpillar?
[3:03:19] <ManOfReason> lol that really got woolie
[3:03:22] <+butch_deadlift> lmao
[3:03:23] <jubejube56> I mean I think they must know, certain bugs can infest caterpillars by laying eggs inside of a caterpillar until they hatch, then brainwash the caterpillar to waste it's silk protecting the hatchlings
[3:03:34] <%mh9s> i need sum FUK
[3:03:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember the footage of the deer kicking the shit out of the hunter
[3:03:38] <C_game_me_811> Woolie please
[3:03:38] <jubejube56> so they probably have a goal in mind but maybe not an exact outcome
[3:03:40] <%Tuba_Anon> A caterpillar only knows it is a caterpillar. A caterpillar knows not to be a butterfly becuse a caterpillar is not a butterfly. All caterpillars have potential to be a butterfly, and every butterfly you see has been a caterpillar. You are who you are in the now, but you cannot be a you for tomorrow. The you of today knows that it was the you of yesterday.

[3:07:15] <serpenttucker> @NovaKnightmare xfinity and comcast are the same thing, so yes
[3:07:20] <%Tuba_Anon> Is woolie the new boss of team rocket?
[3:07:21] <NovaKnightmare> yea figured
[3:07:25] <wolvenelf> lol
[3:07:28] <NovaKnightmare> but ty for confirming
[3:07:33] <%Wool> were we allowed rematches lol
[3:07:44] <Geassmaster5> That was me, the console froze. When i saw my connection to you was 60 ping
[3:07:47] <SnaKemuho> @juxtest there's one where she freezes them and breaks their head with her head, no replacements
[3:08:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> if new people come in i will gladly leave
[3:08:13] <serpenttucker> @NovaKnightmare Working for comcast, I get asked that a lot. They mostly did it to try and get away from the bat stigma that came with their name in the past.
[3:08:19] <%juxtest> :(
[3:08:20] <serpenttucker> *bad
[3:08:36] <serpenttucker> Rather, did work for comcast.
[3:08:42] <%Tuba_Anon> This new deep fried wombat 11 is pretty smooth and crunchy at the same time.
[3:08:45] <jubejube56> question is will Woolie remember that costume chat wanted him to check out?
[3:08:51] <SnaKemuho> but nexgen doesn't have sick cancels
[3:08:52] <Almondite> So Frost was basically made for Woolie, right?
[3:09:02] <%Solidnick18> when i played it just drops
[3:09:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> you have to kustomize
[3:09:19] <+CrackedPipe457> I just hopped in, any character preferences yet?
[3:09:24] <%QueequegTheater> DO IT
[3:09:33] <MrGreenToS> I prefer Jaqui long hair outfits more
[3:09:35] <SnaKemuho> DO IT
[3:09:42] <C_game_me_811> Do it
[3:09:44] <%QueequegTheater> yes we do
[3:09:46] <keiji_maede> Don't get fucked, good sir
[3:09:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> BIG WOOLIE HOLE SMELLS
[3:09:48] <SnaKemuho> And pick another variation, it's basically DMC Balrog
[3:09:49] <+universboy95> It's super worth it
[3:09:50] <Almondite> It's a good tutorial.
[3:09:50] <Someguy893> Long hair coward
[3:09:52] <TwinBat> woolie hole never dies
[3:09:55] <RICE02> that meme is still fresh
[3:09:56] <+Sdeje> Is this costume WoolieBait?
[3:09:59] <+rorschachsjournal505> That wakanda Jackie stuff or jacket?
[3:09:59] <+Irridium> stink lines all over
[3:10:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus you can't close the woolie hole
[3:10:10] <%QueequegTheater> Updating our meme references will destroy this channel
[3:10:12] <jubejube56> is wooliebait the new wooliehole?
[3:10:14] <volraths_bane> what is dead may never die
[3:10:18] <%Tuba_Anon> The dead horse was graverobbed far before reggie started digging for the dead horse.
[3:10:18] <TheTwerkinator> I really like her skin with the jacket
[3:10:43] <Prism_Wing> Noob Saibot only consults the dead memes.
[3:10:44] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus Maybe not exactly something you can do on stream, but Jacqui has a great costume from her first character-specific tower you can summon.
[3:10:59] <%ChoculaUltra> is there a skin that changes Sonya's voice actor
[3:11:14] <%Solidnick18> no
[3:11:19] <%Solidnick18> sadly
[3:11:22] <%ChoculaUltra> fuck this earthrealm.

[3:15:39] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus You can set a variation as your default so it becomes your default appearance for ranked mode.

[3:18:29] <Smileyhat> I probably have the outfit y'all are talking about.
[3:18:33] <Almondite> Their are only two types of effort for Woolie. The absolute minimum required, and the HYPE MAXIMUM!
[3:18:36] <%Tuba_Anon> Give Reggie Senpai your energy.
[3:18:54] <%Wool> hahahaha
[3:18:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:19:43] <%QueequegTheater> we're reaching edge levels that shouldn't even be possible
[3:19:44] <mayorrev> Does he have "YOU WEAK PATHETIC FOOL"?
[3:20:06] <%topendbuzz> topendbuzz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Kotal Khan is the biggest jobber ever woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:20:08] <%Tuba_Anon> So smooth. So crisp. This Deep Fried Wombat... Oof. IT's so good.
[3:20:58] <%ThatGuyThere03> So apparently Kotal jobbed to Shao in the story
[3:21:08] <%ThatGuyThere03> Why would they make such a cool character job like that
[3:21:23] <%topendbuzz> not just Shao
[3:21:26] <jubejube56> @ThatGuyThere03 I mean he did but Kotal also totally jobbed to Kung Jin last game
[3:21:30] <Make_me_mad> Kotal has never been anything but a jobber.
[3:21:39] <Make_me_mad> He was always lame and people pretended he was cool.
[3:21:42] <%ThatGuyThere03> But he's so fucking cool looking though
[3:21:44] <JayEarly> How many people can be in one room anyway
[3:21:45] <Stravoa> Kotal's design is great, but yea he is a jobber
[3:21:54] <+CrackedPipe457> I saw one combo with a taunt, but it was a kinda weak special build
[3:21:55] <+TricycleWarlord> Guess I'm a jobber lobosSmug
[3:21:59] <ponyboytickleme> boyoLURK
[3:22:03] <+Terrinater_> as a kotal main... yeah he is a bit of a jobber

[3:23:33] <+Terrinater_> did you see the tweet they put out? "All d'vorah mains: whats your favorite new skill?"

[3:52:54] <%Tuba_Anon> I for one love our new RT Redbull Shitlords at CastleSuperbeastTM, now available at your local CVS and Walgreens.
[3:53:01] <Almondite> Wooie is contractually obligated to like RWBy now that he works with RoosterTeeth.
[3:53:15] <JayEarly> i think that outfits cool personally
[3:53:22] <+supaXmugen> he works for them?
[3:53:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> but, like, the thing happens that makes him accept them
[3:53:36] <tungstenviper> Big Trouble in Little China
[3:53:37] <ManOfReason> REGGIE
[3:53:41] <$SilverRoddo> I heard Woolie is now writing for RWBY?

[3:57:07] <+Wrashis> hey woolz, speaking of the podcast and next gen talk, if the xbonex has a next gen equivalent, would it be called the xXBoneXx
[3:57:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> Kung Lao's arcade tower ending is the most up his own ass thing i've seen in awhile
[3:57:23] <BlacSoul> i recognized Kahn but not frost
[3:57:25] <%QueequegTheater> How is Shao Khan unlocked
[3:57:34] <+Irridium> pre-ordering the game
[3:57:35] <%juxtest> $$$
[3:57:39] <%Tuba_Anon> SAW-MBREROS AND FREEZIEPOPS LET'S GO
[3:57:40] <SnaKemuho> preorder for now
[3:57:41] <JayEarly> @queequegtheater money
[3:57:42] <mypalkevin> @QueequegTheater preorder bonus
[3:57:43] <GoDZooKii> Money
[3:57:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> @QueequegTheater he was pre-order dlc so either story or idk
[3:57:47] <+Cavumentum> So when's Chewie and Fuckface: Live From Castle Super Beast, the hit new Roosterteeth animated series?

[3:58:31] <alexandrecau> when's motaro
[3:58:31] <%Tuba_Anon> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieOMG
[3:58:32] <%Gamefriendly> Seriously whats up with the Woolie and Roosterteeth thing?
[3:58:36] <GoDZooKii> I call it unlockable because
[3:58:40] <keiji_maede> DAMN
[3:58:50] <$SilverRoddo> I think Fooltalities need to be introduced, to completely screw over the better player, in which the losing player will survive and a Kung Lao player would accidentally cut his own head off.
[3:58:53] <mankeyfigh> DAM
[3:59:00] <JayEarly> They mention Takeda in so many intro dialogues, he better be DLC
[3:59:01] <alexandrecau> Like Kronika is pretty much as cheap as motaro
[3:59:10] <EnderGamma> rooster teeth?
[3:59:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's MOTARO
[3:59:45] <JayEarly> The fact that you can’t grab Kronika is so dumb
[3:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <GreatestGuess> You can teleport after setting orbital hat
[4:00:10] <%Gamefriendly> @EnderGamma they briefly mentioned something about Woolie being with Roosterteeth or something. I dunno, trying to find out
[4:00:15] <alexandrecau> I mean you never could grab a boss
[4:00:28] <TheTwerkinator> I hate that she gets pushed back constantly I always find I'm out of range for my combo
[4:00:29] <+joestar4> @Gamefriendly It's on his twitter
[4:00:32] <+Okosisi89> check his twitter, he's a rooster teeth partner
[4:00:34] <JayEarly> and she’s immune to fatal blows
[4:00:42] <+Irridium> Test Your Luck should come back and be an evo event
[4:00:52] <SnaKemuho> so technically, could dead from Netherrealm swim over that sea back to the Earthrealm?
[4:01:14] <+Binary_Fireball> does woolz like sub zero or scorpion more?
[4:01:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> kronika is just as a bad a boss as you would expect seeing as how she's a nrs fighting game boss
[4:01:24] <alexandrecau> @SnaKemuho no too far they'll sink
[4:01:26] <%Wool> THE SALTY RUNBACK
[4:01:32] <+Binary_Fireball> I need to know as it will decide everything
[4:01:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> just crouching kick him
[4:01:49] <TheTwerkinator> fighting games tend to have cheap bosses in general
[4:01:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:01:51] <ghostravens> salty reggie is back
[4:01:52] <mistersups> Shake out the Slat
[4:01:55] <SnaKemuho> @alexandrecau but if they build a Netherboat or something
