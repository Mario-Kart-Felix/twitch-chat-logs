[0:36:34] <@Lardcat> Kamds_ - You have won! Please speak up in chat!
[0:36:35] <tetzel_que> Zone of the enders hell yeah!

[0:36:44] <VirtuaRailith> ZoE 2 is Kojima's best game
[0:36:44] <@Roz_Lynd> @Kamds_ speak up in chat please you're a winner
[0:36:45] <+Zero_Awakening> zoe1 story is blah but gameplay was good
[0:36:50] <bludemon1235> zone of the enders is the best series made by kojima
[0:36:53] <+bakukider123> I tried to colour my operator to look like a pilot from darling in the franxx
[0:36:53] <Solidus_113> ZoE 1's gameplay by today's standards is the worst thing
[0:36:57] <+xhy720> ZoE 2 is better than 1, but that's like saying you like ice cream more than cake. Both are still awesome.
[0:37:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think ZoE 1 is fairly decent, but ZoE 2 is considerably better

[0:46:22] <Tearbyne> poor Bioware
[0:46:23] <Forester_Skippy> if you enjoy games that progresion means you get weaker and drive you into the dirt thats good for you
[0:46:25] <Murrayshurn> Anthem: End them

[0:46:41] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Anthem is not a game, it's an interactive electronic mess
[0:46:48] <+VariantX7> Anthem is the gangrene infested limb of EA rn
[0:46:55] <%kaelstraza> When they make a dollar profit they'll kill it.
[0:46:56] <%epsilon712> candy corn is amazing
[0:46:57] <+GarbageNirvana> The arm didn't infect the brain, it was the other way around
[0:47:04] <+Original_Sin> Pat! Holy shit it's Pat!

[0:48:13] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I reject my humanity guys
[0:48:14] <Zedimonx5> I’d argue that it’s more so stockholm syndrome if you enjoy Anthem
[0:48:15] <+Manks> "You WILL have phones damn it"
[0:48:19] <weissguard> LUL
[0:48:20] <GoldWaveTV> Bioware should just shelve Anthem, remaster the OG Mass Effect trilogy to earn a tad bit of redemption, and just take a break for a while and quietly make a game that ISN'T a complete dumpster fire
[0:48:21] <%Mrbaconator> Bloodstained comes out on june 18th of this year!

[0:55:42] <HUNTER_HUN20> Hi :)
[0:55:44] <OracleRaven> he didn't make Megaman though, he's a businessman and he submitted artwork
[0:55:50] <TheSpartanThief> And then it came out and we cried like an anime fan on prom night.
[0:55:52] <+RushUnplugged> surely we can trust the man that ALMOST RUINED CAPCOM
[0:55:52] <+SuichiTanaka> Too bad it turned out the dude behind Mega Man wound up being the reason Capcom sucked for so many years
[0:55:56] <spectgore> Then Mega Man 11 came and it was great
[0:55:56] <Kutakai666> At least Shovel Knight was a success.

[0:56:54] <salty_syd913> ooh whatcha drinking?
[0:56:55] <Uhnrealistic> MUG
[0:56:57] <iusetheinternet> there was also that point in time Kojima productions went out of their way to hire people screwed over by Konami
[0:56:58] <Solidus_113> the real Death Stranding was the friends we made along the way

[0:57:46] <strange248> Kojima has great ideas, but he's a mediocre writter.
[0:57:46] <CandideCamera> People let their expectations get away from them
[0:57:47] <loosey_fur> metal... gear?!
[0:57:51] <OracleRaven> Kojima and his team wasn't able to finish the 3rd chapter of MGSV. It could have been great
[0:57:54] <JimJamr> Eating from the side!!! You monster, i love it!
[0:57:54] <%wild_car> 4 is a movie

[0:58:30] <strange248> @HentaiSenpai9K the story is great, but it's not much of a *game* if you know what i mean
[0:58:35] <OracleRaven> MGS3 and Peace Walker were amazing experiences for me
[0:58:36] <+beardedjho> REVENGANCe is the best metal gear
[0:58:36] <$HentaiSenpai9K> The only MG game I've played is Revengeance
[0:58:40] <%slave_one> MGSV is too open-world
[0:58:45] <Solidus_113> the whole Lord of the Flies cut chapter was really cool, and would've been a good finale

[0:59:09] <%NeithVII> MGS1 best Metal Gear

[1:07:52] <Cornholio676> thoughts on Destiny?
[1:07:55] <%Mrbaconator> wasn't force unleashed on the wii?
[1:07:55] <JimJamr> Didn't Force Unleashed on Wii have lightsaber multiplayer duels?
[1:07:58] <%silveranthony91> STAR DESTROYERS, I'M GONNA COME
[1:08:00] <MarshMan301> "Lightsaber, turn on!"
[1:08:00] <+OkieMurse> Star Wars Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels?
[1:08:02] <+gingernator3001> There was Force Unleashed on the Wii
[1:08:05] <+ParadoxicalPeace> Star Wars The Force Unleashed was a lightsaber game on the Wii
[1:08:05] <Tearbyne> lmao
[1:08:07] <@Roz_Lynd> @Cornholio676 it's pretty unfortunate
[1:08:07] <%irisillych> oh god shut up
[1:08:11] <%irisillych> it hurts
[1:08:15] <%Mezuka> why do you gotta yell at your lightsaber to turn it on
[1:08:16] <%Mrbaconator> im pretty sure force unleashed was a thing and even woolie worked on it
[1:08:22] <suikudo> Do you guys remember that nintendo band bullshit when the wii first came out?
[1:08:22] <%Mistheart101> @ParadoxicalPeace YES THANK YOU

[1:08:28] <thetruenicster> both Force Unleashed games were on the Wii
[1:08:31] <+ParadoxicalPeace> The Force Unleashed was great on the Wii
[1:08:32] <Tearbyne> not bioshock!
[1:08:41] <Nero9341> there was star wars: the clone wars lightsaber duels on the wii
[1:08:45] <%Casardis> Do I need to remind you that only a few years ago we got Anthem demo which is also fake?

[1:08:54] <transporterthesequel> Or people “playing” on stage
[1:08:54] <%silveranthony91> The story makes no physical sense
[1:09:04] <%Mistheart101> I got pissed when I saw the differences between Force Unleashed... I think 2? On PC and Wii.
[1:09:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Bioshock Infinite is kinda like Inception its either shit or amazing
[1:09:09] <%irisillych> pat's not wrong
[1:09:10] <%silveranthony91> Like the ending can't happen
[1:09:12] <%Mezuka> I really liked Bioshock Infinite, but it had so much more potential
[1:09:13] <@Roz_Lynd> here we go...
[1:09:22] <castcode> lmao
[1:09:25] <KaliasTV> Racial segregation was very common in SKY ISLAND times

[1:09:41] <Stol3nheart> I like infinite. Not gonna defend it though.
[1:09:42] <+beardedjho> Epic Sparows Underground 3: The Anti-Christ Air is still the best tony hawk game
[1:09:42] <bludemon1235> bioshock infinite demo is 10x better than the full relize

[1:11:52] <%KecakInogat> sounds like RedLetterMedia
[1:11:53] <bludemon1235> 999 was written in backwards by the way

[1:12:30] <TylRegorgeous> 999 easter egg: punch it into your phone if you live in the uk and you get to talk to a peace officer.
[1:12:41] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Is 999 that Japanese visual novel?
[1:12:44] <Inkogni> surprised no1 mentioned NMS or last Mass Effect

[1:45:52] <+terry_quest> the skills are so weak
[1:45:56] <Forester_Skippy> to be fair blu at level 50 is super broken
[1:45:57] <transporterthesequel> That’s because BLU is busted as shit
[1:46:04] <+HelloImTom08> it was fun to lvl up and run around the open world
[1:46:05] <crocodile_t34rz> Blue Mages put in the kiddy corner

[1:47:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> A lot of DPS you mean
[1:47:19] <aeonicvector> TA to Tactics is fine, but WotL to Tactics Advanced isnt a smooth transition
[1:47:20] <chell_cake> the one for the psp is great too
[1:47:20] <+terry_quest> ohh yea i remeber i locked my self out of getting every quest
[1:47:25] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Nah I like em too

[1:47:28] <+Reizie_Etherealm> There's too many DPS classes
[1:47:30] <Laecerelius> Advance 1 has that shitty judge system which was a pain to deal with but everything else was good

[1:48:36] <+terry_quest> regular tactics came with the psp
[1:48:39] <+croxeye> Tactics did get released with the War of the Lion edition @QuietteShy
[1:48:39] <+Reinbach_III> Final Fantasy 7 was the first in the series to get released in Europe
[1:48:51] <danpc5> XENOGEARS
[1:48:58] <transporterthesequel> Wao
[1:48:59] <%caperAntagonist> my cousin had to emulate chrono trigger

[1:49:04] <degsco> Nice latte
[1:49:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @crocodile_t34rz War of the Lions was a Tactics re-release for PsP and IOs
[1:49:09] <SnakeCL> Xenogears
[1:49:09] <+terry_quest> europe missed alot of rpgs
[1:49:15] <samikillerbee> the original ff7 was never released bc i think japan thought americans were too stupid to play it
[1:49:15] <SnakeCL> Xenogears is must play
[1:49:16] <MarshMan301> now australia gets no violent games
[1:49:18] <@Roz_Lynd> !mutes
[1:49:18] <@Lardcat> quiettThonk Mutes don't speak. They can't. Therefore, the one(s) you hear cannot possibly be Shy; because Shy is mute! The one(s) you hear would be our wonderful host(s)!
[1:49:25] <雪暴> @crocodile_t34rz remake of FFT for mobile and hand helds
[1:49:36] <danpc5> i played xenogears but i hate that i could not get it legaly
[1:49:45] <TheSpartanThief> That's nothing, our first "Final Fantasy" was Mystic Quest....the game that was dumbed down for westerners because they figured they wouldn't get a JRPG...
[1:49:53] <Ratmut> There's an anime as well
[1:49:54] <Forester_Skippy> wait WHAT?

[1:54:51] <Tennochief> toilet porn best porn
[1:55:02] <%Zombeef> Thundergod Cid is my favorite boss in the ivalice raids in 14
[1:55:02] <gorillahandz> I still need to play FFT...
[1:55:06] <Huntercd> Pat's not wrong
[1:55:11] <+Camshak> T.G. Cid is the reason why many parties have issues with the raid in FF XIV
[1:55:15] <transporterthesequel> I love that they did that
[1:55:21] <%Zedonus0> wtf is toilet porn igaUh
[1:55:23] <$HentaiSenpai9K> He cums with Excalibur?
[1:55:24] <@Lardcat> Give up some love for our super amazing special guests, the amazing and wonderful @angriestpat Patrick Boivin!! > https://twitter.com/angriestpat/ & https://twitch.tv/angriestpat/
[1:55:49] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @gorillahandz It's amazing in gameplay and plot. Best FF game
[1:55:52] <transporterthesequel> Poor Meliadoul get’s her shit blown out by TG Cid
[1:56:06] <+ChrisAlgoo> no garfgarog!
[1:56:14] <Laecerelius> Everyone gets their shit blown out by TG Cid
[1:56:17] <VirtuaRailith> Why don't you get on that Disgaea Pat. The game is "make the number get bigger" the game
[1:56:19] <+terry_quest> FFT/ff12 raid
[1:56:25] <+terry_quest> pretty damn good
[1:56:28] <transporterthesequel> TIME.....MAGE....CLOUD
[1:56:33] <OracleRaven> Ramza is great as a Squire / White Mage. His Squire class has pretty good abilities and stats, and the priest abilities gives him Holy and Raise
[1:56:33] <+Camshak> I love the worker 8 fight in FF XIV. So many people are bad at math LUL
[1:56:33] <Laecerelius> Being shit compared to TG Cid is like being worse than a literal god
[1:56:37] <Hazard_Kujacker> Dont forget you also get the exclusive War of the Lions paryt member Balthier aka THE STRONGEST DPS IN THE GAME
[1:56:47] <%Schtirk> Well this drawing.... sucks quiettcheer1000

[1:57:23] <Laecerelius> Then there's Luso, AKA Ramza #2 with inherent Poach
[1:57:24] <aeonicvector> Calcs are the best
[1:57:28] <suikudo> Mathmeticians are fucking busted
[1:57:32] <+masked_hero_lucky> Have fun with that BS Wiegraf fight, hope you build yourself up very specifically or you're dead
[1:57:36] <%Remery_> I liked Geomancers :)
[1:57:40] <transporterthesequel> YO dual-wield Ninja Ramza is CANON
[1:57:46] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @suikudo IKR?
[1:57:47] <OracleRaven> Black chocobo Kappa
[1:57:48] <Laecerelius> Calculator with Excalibur shooting out Holy everywhere
[1:57:56] <Hazard_Kujacker> 5th one is Balthier because barrage
[1:58:11] <@Roz_Lynd> i run the non-meta
[1:58:31] <aeonicvector> he is
[1:58:33] <Fujiwara_92> Balthier should've been the 12 protag
[1:58:33] <Laecerelius> Balthier is in the PSP version
[1:58:34] <Valdorick> He's added in War of the Lion
[1:58:36] <+terry_quest> War of the lions has quest characters
[1:58:40] <Laecerelius> He can attack twice in a turn
[1:58:40] <+terry_quest> guest*
[1:58:43] <OracleRaven> Mustafio? Mustardo? I forgot his name. He has abilities that disable actions and a gun
[1:58:49] <+terry_quest> yea cloud is in
[1:58:50] <+DeNaeDementia> Hey there everyone ashleyAww
[1:58:51] <$HentaiSenpai9K> No Balthier was in A2
[1:58:53] <worldbrand> i like gyromancy
[1:58:55] <Laecerelius> And has super versions of every steal ability
[1:58:59] <%Zombeef> Mustadio
[1:58:59] <chell_cake> mustadio
[1:59:02] <Valthios> Beowulf was the strongest character, don't @ me.
[1:59:04] <transporterthesequel> Time mage Cloud was the shit tho
[1:59:10] <%Zombeef> Time Mage is my shit
[1:59:12] <transporterthesequel> Instant limits!
[1:59:14] <+scurvydawgs> @roz_lynd is there a giveaway going
[1:59:18] <雪暴> @HentaiSenpai9K balthier wasn't in A2 that was Vaan
[1:59:19] <knaveofclubs> I found monks got broken when you boosted them enough with brave
[1:59:20] <@Roz_Lynd> it is not
[1:59:24] <%Remery_> I hated fighting Time MAges
[1:59:28] <Tearbyne> which one
[1:59:30] <+OkieMurse> As much as it pains me to say it, I have played Disgaea far more than FFT. I loved FFT's story but I always got tired of it before the end.
[1:59:31] <johngreatfield> u can draw, u can buy tons of domestic drones, it's still not enough to clear out all those mags
[1:59:32] <transporterthesequel> ASSASSIN!
[1:59:32] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Oh right
[1:59:36] <Laecerelius> Yeah, Vaan and Penelo are in A2
[1:59:37] <%Zombeef> Nier raid in 14 is hype
[1:59:40] <+terry_quest> play it
[1:59:46] <knaveofclubs> if you had a mediator, you could permenately boost their brave. And getting 99 brave on a monk was gross
[1:59:51] <transporterthesequel> Assassin is the saving grace of FFTA.
[1:59:51] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @quietteshy stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:54] <AmericanaRed> Bruh
[1:59:57] <gorillahandz> Just play it!!
[1:59:59] <@Roz_Lynd> i keep starting the game and i can't frickin finish it
[2:00:03] <Laecerelius> Farm the golden bunny with 9S
[2:00:06] <zamzoph> just fight the statue in front of the amusement park a couple times and you're max level
[2:00:17] <+griffinblade323> of course he doesnt, he plays warframe
[2:00:17] <Valdorick> Aw man, anytime I think about FFT, I always just think about how Ogre Battle got shafted...
[2:00:18] <Brofarian> You haven't watched DEATHNOTE!?
[2:00:19] <%Zedonus0> @sarahtsang Praise Cleaning Drone, huh? igaLol

[2:00:30] <alrobot2014> emil kept kicking my ass with his great store deals and discounts :(
[2:00:34] <+GarbageNirvana> Not to derail the convo but all of Telltale's games are getting delisted from Steam/GOG on the 27th
[2:00:35] <+VanaSkiller> being that guy LUL
[2:00:37] <Lenmutt> Why else would you play it? sexy robo asses are best
[2:00:39] <+GarbageNirvana> In case y'all have something you wanna pick up
[2:00:40] <+commanderclaw> Automata, Snubbed in favor of the Iconic PUBG theme
[2:00:56] <gorillahandz> 2017 was such a stacked fuckin year too. Persona 5, Hollow Knight, Breath of the Wild, holy fuck
[2:01:02] <transporterthesequel> 999 to Automata is gonna be a SWING.
[2:01:05] <Solidus_113> Ending K
[2:01:07] <iusetheinternet> ending K is great
[2:01:13] <Lenmutt> robots can't eat fish
[2:01:22] <VirtuaRailith> Mario Odyssey was my fav of 2017
[2:01:29] <transporterthesequel> No, they are literally are canon
[2:01:33] <transporterthesequel> Per Taro
[2:01:41] <transporterthesequel> Every single ending
[2:01:42] <Lenmutt> I like the ending where 2B leaves and just goes fishing
[2:01:47] <Dr00_PhD> aji wo [k]utte or something like that
[2:01:48] <Jermatoo> Speaking of character action games, have you guys heard of an indie game called Devil's Slave? It looks like Japanese indie DMC in a good way.
[2:01:49] <gorillahandz> My favorite is self destructing on the base and the Commander being really butt mad about it
[2:01:51] <Solidus_113> A to E are the real "Routes" and F to Z are Joke ends
[2:01:52] <crocodile_t34rz> What a specific design flaw
[2:01:52] <+OkieMurse> I've heard about Persona a bajillion times but I never know where to enter the series as someone totally oblivious to it and SMT.
[2:01:53] <transporterthesequel> For all of his games
[2:01:56] <Brofarian> split timelines
[2:01:57] <+gingernator3001> Nier has 26 endings for every letter of the alphabet, and 21 of them are joke endings that scroll credits in 5 seconds
[2:01:58] <worldbrand> they're all canon
[2:02:00] <%Zombeef> All. Canon.
[2:02:01] <zamzoph> have you SEEN the drakengard timeline?!
[2:02:01] <+terry_quest> Yoko taro is a god
[2:02:03] <Laecerelius> Yup, every ending in every Taro game is canon in alternate timelines
[2:02:03] <+JavaManJoJo> Because Yoko Taro is a madman
[2:02:08] <Valdorick> Ending E in Drakengard was cannon.
[2:02:10] <%Wynterchant> VN logic: All endings happens
[2:02:10] <+terry_quest> Clemps
[2:02:10] <+SuichiTanaka> Clempsy boi!
[2:02:14] <Solidus_113> Shoutouts to CLEMPS BOI
[2:02:15] <Fodderbot> mr clemps
[2:02:15] <Valdorick> So every ending is cannon.
[2:02:16] <alrobot2014> the rat boi himself
[2:02:18] <Dr00_PhD> Ah the precious Rat Boy
[2:02:20] <Laecerelius> Rat boy!
[2:02:21] <Tennochief> CLEMPA
[2:02:21] <%Drachnyn95> mister clem quiettSmug
[2:02:21] <gorillahandz> PLUG THAT BOY
[2:02:24] <Lenmutt> foot degenerate
[2:02:25] <veldinmusic> Rat boi Clemps
[2:02:27] <Fodderbot> limey rat boi
[2:02:27] <VioletHeart> Clemps is a good boy and also a horrible foot goblin.
[2:02:29] <gorillahandz> PLUG RAT BOY
[2:02:30] <VirtuaRailith> Clemps is the rat boy genius
[2:02:31] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Clemps and Teal
[2:02:32] <%Remery_> the guy that loves feet and buttholes
[2:02:36] <Brofarian> Nier itself is based on a joke ending from Drakengard
[2:02:38] <Laecerelius> He's the biggest rat who makes all of the rules!
[2:02:39] <$DigbyMayor> Sewer pervert clamps
[2:02:42] <zamzoph> I did play those tho (but not Drakengard 2)
[2:02:51] <$KevinsLunchbox> Clemps is my guy
[2:02:57] <%Zombeef> Man, I rented Drakenguard from blockbuster back in the day, that game left a hell of an impact on younger me
[2:02:59] <%Wynterchant> Blaze, All Yoko Taro games get depressing
[2:03:04] <雪暴> @Brofarian not a joke ending. A apocolyse ending
[2:03:06] <zamzoph> or, you know, play the games
[2:03:09] <+JavaManJoJo> Do you homework
[2:03:10] <Laecerelius> Foot rat boy Clemps
[2:03:13] <+Camshak> Yoko Taros storytelling is hella crazy
[2:03:14] <aeonicvector> Sewer Pervert Clemps is great
[2:03:16] <+VoidHaunter> I can't wait for the canon Nier raid in FFXIV
[2:03:22] <gorillahandz> Link the NieR LP

[2:06:38] <veldinmusic> Pat dies live on stream
[2:06:38] <n3ls1s> WHAT
[2:06:39] <$KevinsLunchbox> My Dad had his work email, not even a personal email and someone emailed him the Hamster Dance, this was mid 90s
[2:06:40] <alrobot2014> pat's falling apart due to age
[2:06:42] <+SuichiTanaka> Drink more Red Bull to fix it
[2:06:42] <Laecerelius> Is Pat being infected by Paige's blindness?!

[2:08:02] <veldinmusic> GET BIG GET HEALTH
[2:08:06] <love_you3000> I can't play blowing instruments because it makes me go blank
[2:08:11] <Valdorick> When the dark days come, that health will equate directly to HP. No bandits stealing your food, you already got it.
[2:08:11] <%Remery_> he dies on stream and Elmo chews on his corpse\
[2:08:13] <%Zedonus0> Pat, I know what you're talking about, but my head hurts first THEN eye sight loss after laughing too long in pain
[2:08:17] <gorillahandz> Someone make a “Edited with Organs” meme with Pat
[2:08:17] <NoirePanzer> The belly is his Red Bull reserves
[2:08:18] <+alphonseisbest> how long has the stream been on 4? trying to gauge how much i missed

[2:09:57] <Laecerelius> Pat loves his addictions!
[2:09:59] <MarshMan301> the Carl Wheezer types
[2:10:01] <Tampaoster> Canada the country of drugs
[2:10:03] <NoirePanzer> Pat the Drug Dealer
[2:10:04] <%KecakInogat> ventolin doesn't taste bad and it feels pretty good when you take it, but you shouldn't cause you can easily get addicted, for real though.
[2:10:08] <Firemane1279> Pat getting on them drugs. LUL
[2:10:10] <+OkieMurse> off the shelf doesn't mean safe - you can buy acetaminophen over the counter too
[2:10:13] <DotDusk> Hey kids, want some ventoni

[2:10:36] <Pale_Strider> Strength to the grineer!
[2:10:39] <+rdark_ksu> is it not just your association with the ability to breathe with the taste of ventalin?
[2:10:41] <AncelDeLambert> watch that thing, it's on Solidus' youtube channel
[2:10:43] <Laecerelius> People paid for his addiction!
[2:10:44] <Forester_Skippy> just watch the cut version on youtube

[2:11:12] <veldinmusic> It was a real success full stream
[2:11:13] <im_very_batty> All donations go towards rehab
[2:11:13] <MjrPackage> is that shame I hear Pat/
[2:11:14] <%Remery_> You will never look at Pat the same way again
[2:11:15] <alrobot2014> and that was edited
[2:11:15] <+nano_vg> and the time pat said 50% on plat is free money
[2:11:15] <MjrPackage> ?
[2:11:17] <transporterthesequel> Pat v Paige on Warframe is ART
[2:11:20] <gorillahandz> Paige caught wind and it got REAL awkward
[2:11:23] <Solidus_113> There's a second video where Pat is trying to rationalize using his 75% platinum coupon
[2:11:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> It's amazing
[2:11:27] <transporterthesequel> FREE MONEY
[2:11:28] <%silveranthony91> The better video is when Pat is yelling to Paige about the colour PURPLE
[2:11:32] <@Roz_Lynd> ........
[2:11:35] <Fujiwara_92> NAH THAT VIDEO IS GREAT PogChamp
[2:11:36] <+QivroStream> Kappa

[2:11:39] <+SuichiTanaka> It's FREE MONEY
[2:11:40] <Forester_Skippy> its basicly free
[2:11:41] <AncelDeLambert> definitley don't watch ALL of Solidus' stuff as he cuts videos from SBFP to make Pat look like Pat
[2:11:43] <Valdorick> Don't watch Pat talking himself into using a 50% off plat logon bonus
[2:11:44] <Fodderbot> That's Solidus113 that you have to avoid
[2:11:46] <VioletHeart> No do it though.
[2:11:47] <@Roz_Lynd> can't be bothered
[2:11:48] <$KevinsLunchbox> i find it hard to believe there are people here who dont know Pat
[2:11:48] <%FromThe70s> Because chat usually goes for the laziest option
[2:11:49] <n3ls1s> GG pat
[2:11:49] <worldbrand> Pat HATES getting shot!
