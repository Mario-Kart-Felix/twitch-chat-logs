[0:34:53] <dukenux> wait, it looks BLUE to you?
[0:34:54] <+griffball13> RED MAKES IT GO FASTA
[0:34:54] <+fowlfolk> It's a yellow to us and it's nice
[0:34:54] <eustine> Put on racing stripes, +25 horsepower.
[0:34:57] <KatabolicRage> looks like a zaku 2 colour to me
[0:34:58] <CityKani> thats tan tho
[0:35:01] <%LethargicRush> kinda like a mint green
[0:35:02] <danknugglit> Blue Kappa
[0:35:05] <Kalcom> orc tan
[0:35:06] <+deliciousmocha> Please tell me he's been in this menu since the stream started.
[0:35:07] <+fatal_penguin_> G Spot Cannon

[0:35:11] <%LowEnergyStarman> ...green eh?
[0:35:11] <+gespenst25> That's no Zaku boy, no Zaku
[0:35:16] <+MagickBurritoh> burgundy is cool
[0:35:20] <$Superdandy96> Well there’s my favorite color for the mech
[0:35:21] <SpaceGuntank> G-Cannon? dont you mean the Heavy Gun?
[0:35:26] <+Rada150> brown name it chocolate thunder
[0:35:32] <dukenux> Red or gray
[0:35:35] <Thirtine> darker version of the same color!
[0:35:38] <raven_frame> This stream is all about figuring out who’s colour blind.
[0:35:44] <@akuda_bar> prepare for disappointment about Color 3
[0:35:50] <AllenDeadman> da whitest
[0:35:51] <SpaceGuntank> bleach it
[0:35:56] <+fatal_penguin_> This is worse than a Bethesda game character creation
[0:35:59] <dukenux> nope
[0:35:59] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> YESSSSS I Wanted you to play this forever
[0:36:01] <KeroKamina> yo ucannot do the dark parts, they are hte endoskeleton
[0:36:02] <+ArtemisCroc> you can't colour the dark parts or the red lights
[0:36:03] <dukenux> those stay metal
[0:36:04] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @NecDW4
[0:36:04] <Nazgul240> white washed
[0:36:05] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Woolie you gotta play Sekiro too bruh
[0:36:06] <@Solidus_113> fully body is just each section combined
[0:36:08] <$Superdandy96> @rada150 call it Sexual Chocolate
[0:36:09] <+gespenst25> Patlabir?
[0:36:11] <%DashXero> Dark parts can't be edited.
[0:36:12] <CynicalKirby> Guess that must be inner frame then
[0:36:15] <+Grayhammatter> the exoskeleton i guess
[0:36:15] <+ApocalypticExpress> this is about when i expected it to start
[0:36:17] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus you cannot do the dark parts
[0:36:17] <danknugglit> Boo
[0:36:17] <+greenfall> looks like a kampfer
[0:36:22] <$eldritchhorrortwitchchat> For that universe it could be a zaku.
[0:36:23] <%Eaglestrike117> Its cause its the basic one woolie
[0:36:24] <@Menitta> Its like a bionicle joint
[0:36:25] <pillowwasp> Dark stays dark
[0:36:25] <+fatal_penguin_> All Pink, Woolz
[0:36:28] <%LowEnergyStarman> that's too real
[0:36:34] <+wunderkindest> Maybe it depends on the Pattern?
[0:36:35] <%LethargicRush> so just do your sig purple and green
[0:36:36] <Thirtine> ALL PINK
[0:36:37] <KeroKamina> woolie attemptign to whitewash live on stream
[0:36:37] <BigNerdSam> You cannot bleach the black
[0:36:38] <CityKani> other side green, other side purple
[0:36:39] <dukenux> Hot pink + lime green it is
[0:36:41] <+ArtemisCroc> armored core, this is not
[0:36:47] <+Intolerable> ALL BLACK
[0:36:49] <+TransporterX7> "Make WhITE GLInT!"
[0:36:52] <NeroInfinite> MAKE ALL PINK
[0:36:52] <+deliciousmocha> Can't whitewash the black mech woolie.
[0:36:53] <Strange_Journey31> thats deep
[0:36:53] <+Darthing23> uwaaa
[0:37:01] <leoneofthestars> these are so cool
[0:37:01] <Doodle_Taco> Red with black is always strong
[0:37:03] <%buildtofail> Blue, cyan, some orange, maybe a wrist sword... Vector cannon
[0:37:03] <$cureneckbeard> This is like Ikaruga again
[0:37:03] <KatabolicRage> yeah armored core would have full colouring for every body part, with 5 colors to change
[0:37:05] <danknugglit> Te white is nice too
[0:37:06] <%LethargicRush> i love that bulky shield
[0:37:06] <@Menitta> Whens the Gundam Breaker 3 stream
[0:37:08] <vVAstrAVv> aren't you used to being stuck with black
[0:37:09] <+griffball13> it's a demo so it could change
[0:37:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> I hope the full game makes the bodies more customizable both the pilot and mech
[0:37:17] <@Solidus_113> show us that EVA-01
[0:37:18] <+fatal_penguin_> Is that a real robot shield or just a trash can lid
[0:37:19] <raven_frame> A beautiful union of Ivory and Ebony.
[0:37:23] <GenoCL> Yeah the perfect game for Woolie
[0:37:27] <xtremegamer80> I named my X-Calibur
[0:37:30] <%guyalex> I bet once you get to swap pieces out each piece will color differently. it's probably only like this for the starting stuff
[0:37:34] <KatabolicRage> to be fair, it could just be the nubbie mech
[0:37:35] <GenoCL> limesHi limesHi Hello wools
[0:37:36] <PaulToon1990> Looks like a Steiger tractor.
[0:37:38] <GoldeNOVA> Woolie you should REALLY play Warframe
[0:37:43] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus this was also a survey demo, you can tweet the creators about this if you have a problem with anything
[0:37:47] <%TechTurtle7> creativity through limitation
[0:37:48] <dukenux> Ebony, Ivory, Blue Rose
[0:37:49] <CynicalKirby> Yeah in Armored core it had like what 5 or 6 options to paint
[0:37:50] <+GeneralHysterics> I don't know what this game is, but that's a sick robot
[0:37:51] <dukenux> there lets go
[0:37:57] <Varanoo> Awful, tan was better
[0:37:59] <Thirtine> make a Knightmare
[0:38:04] <CynicalKirby> 3 is a let down
[0:38:07] <+Noponiz> arent you on the full body option?
[0:38:07] <%DashXero> NO!
[0:38:11] <@mothmandraws> make it like anthem- they breakt he game
[0:38:13] <%QueequegTheater> But this game actually works
[0:38:13] <zamzoph> LIKE ANTHEM LUL
[0:38:14] <KatabolicRage> wander if they let you change any parts in the demo or if your stuck with these parts
[0:38:15] <+fatal_penguin_> Like ANthem, but better
[0:38:15] <simifu> but dont tho
[0:38:16] <MForan98> it might open up more with more parts? hopefully?
[0:38:16] <+ArtemisCroc> it should have been like armore core 4
[0:38:16] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[0:38:17] <%Skullgod> so this game should brick your console?
[0:38:19] <+griffball13> you mean like warframe
[0:38:20] <KTDelgado> NOOOO
[0:38:22] <+tweedler92> There's more parts latter that cover the exoskeleton
[0:38:22] <%DashXero> Don't! Please! Don't!
[0:38:23] <+ArtemisCroc> armored*
[0:38:27] <Xeno351> ok but this actually works
[0:38:28] <+GeneralHysterics> "make it like anthem" said one person ever
[0:38:29] <DatAsuna> Anthem allowing material ID customization was very nice
[0:38:29] <Smart_ZaK1> Make your game like Anthem
[0:38:31] <+Dovakhin573> Yeah Anthem had really good Color shaders
[0:38:32] <raven_frame> Look at camouflage options maybe? Or is there only one?
[0:38:38] <+landmammal> turn back the clock
[0:38:38] <KTDelgado> make it more like either verdict day of for answer
[0:38:40] <DatAsuna> Not just colour hsaders
[0:38:42] <DracaenaLeaf> Caboose!
[0:38:43] <Kalz0ne> I think this the only time I will ever hear make it like anthem
[0:38:44] <DatAsuna> Materials
[0:38:45] <$Superdandy96> ... maybe reword that comment. Don’t want it TOO much like Anthem Kappa
[0:38:50] <DatAsuna> Affecting how it reflects light
[0:38:50] <dukenux> now this purple's better
[0:38:52] <frigglefroogle> maybe you get more mech designs later?
[0:38:52] <xtremegamer80> Also maybe make swords like swords through an unlockable skill
[0:38:55] <dukenux> thoug bit garrish
[0:38:56] <MForan98> Armored Core had some good coloring iirc
[0:38:58] <+Dovakhin573> yeah Anthems best thing whats its paint for its mechs
[0:38:59] <thespoforth> I still think Gundam Breaker has the best customization
[0:39:00] <Strange_Journey31> Anthem works for me
[0:39:01] <$cureneckbeard> indigo
[0:39:03] <+Comrade_Vladof> "Make it like Anthem" is something I never thought I would hear another human say
[0:39:03] <@Menitta> that looks pretty cool
[0:39:03] <GoldeNOVA> Use the shiny pattern
[0:39:06] <dukenux> Thanks Doc
[0:39:09] <leoneofthestars> oooo i like those colors
[0:39:09] <Waypastfuture> EVA 01 then...
[0:39:10] <$FuqBoiSlim> @frigglefroogle yeah you can salvage parts from enemy mechs
[0:39:12] <Doodle_Taco> That looks good
[0:39:13] <vVAstrAVv> really fixed on indigo today jesus
[0:39:15] <%kahunaburger1> Looks bretty gud
[0:39:17] <MustBeColin> Yes!
[0:39:19] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:39:27] <GenoCL> Color it like the gramps Gundam
[0:39:31] <$FuqBoiSlim> your daily dose
[0:39:34] <%kahunaburger1> Thanks doc is just Woolies aesthetic
[0:39:47] <+ArtemisCroc> @WoolieVersus different parts show colours to different degrees too, so don't worry too much
[0:39:49] <%LethargicRush> gotta get some orange in some small places
[0:39:54] <eustine> What about a mode where you get a spray can and have to first personpaint the mech?
[0:39:57] <@Menitta> It really should be like Gundam Breaker 3
[0:39:58] <+liquidzr0> i made char's red zaku in my playthrough
[0:40:11] <Thirtine> its fine! not bad at all for what you have to work with
[0:40:18] <danknugglit> PogChamp

[0:41:03] <GenoCL> I hope the full game includes a Obari pose or something
[0:41:03] <KatabolicRage> try looking in the equipment
[0:41:05] <@Solidus_113> you can pick up new weapons in missions
[0:41:07] <+ArtemisCroc> the weapons are just what you have on
[0:41:08] <KatabolicRage> you can probably change it
[0:41:10] <+Qsmash_> you can get new ones from missions

[0:42:15] <%QueequegTheater> Shields are for the weak
[0:42:15] <KatabolicRage> armor? not parts?
[0:42:15] <+ArtemisCroc> patterns are for people who don't care about custom colours
[0:42:18] <@Menitta> That gold looks like one of those shitty special Bionicles they put out

[0:42:22] <%QueequegTheater> Real men take bullets to the organs
[0:42:27] <KatabolicRage> is the mecha a chassis you put armour on top of rather than swappable bits?

[0:43:28] <GraphicJon> You can grind missions for more gear, parts and try to complete sets
[0:43:28] <simifu> Duel shied is a weird but kind of cool concept for a weapon
[0:43:38] <arkv01> is your Order... a rabbit InuyoFace
[0:43:46] <@Menitta> oh yeah this has craaaazy hud customization
[0:43:50] <%kahunaburger1> I suggest you customize the HUD, the default is pretty wack
[0:43:51] <%LethargicRush> Char has a thing for knowing what a good mobile suit looks like
[0:44:00] <%DashXero> This is AC af.
[0:44:20] <@Solidus_113> AC as in Ace Combat or Armoured Core? LUL
[0:44:23] <%DashXero> There's like, one crucial difference I noticed that I really hope they change for the final game.

[0:47:33] <Am_Shigar00> It's still weird to me to see Nintendo publishing a game like this. It doesn't seem like their usual stuff at all.
[0:47:35] <$Superdandy96> Music is selling me already
[0:47:35] <simifu> Also look at thier logos
[0:47:35] <%LethargicRush> if you are REAPER in any mech game. you are a bad ass by default
[0:47:37] <@akuda_bar> you see why it was important to get the music working
[0:47:37] <+segatas> This game has the same director as AC 2& 3
[0:47:37] <KiraKamixephos> Whole lot of circular terms going on here
[0:47:40] <+ArtemisCroc> Movement isn't as loose as 4, but once you master it you can fly well
[0:47:40] <@Solidus_113> FEMTO METER
[0:47:43] <+Aullama> PogChamp
[0:47:50] <%Solidnick18> let's go
[0:47:52] <Megabyte114> ...did... did you make Unit 01?
[0:47:52] <SolSwagGuy56> How is FRAMERATE
[0:47:58] <simifu> no you're black Kappa
[0:47:58] <KTDelgado> look how tiny it is
[0:48:02] <+Grayhammatter> he tried to
[0:48:04] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[0:48:06] <mrpandabear437> so he finally admits it huh
[0:48:07] <+HaddyMail> I'm white ? cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[0:48:07] <OUTheTeam> Boost while on the ground IT LOOKS SICK
[0:48:11] <GenoCL> @WoolieVersus You're going to want to change the controls later and set the boost to another button to make it easier to move and attack
[0:48:12] <+midnightq2> clip that soundbite
[0:48:16] <KeroKamina> femto energy
[0:48:18] <+segatas> Framerate sucks in the demo esp on mission 2 but it's an E3 build
[0:48:21] <Finakala> The day Woolie doesn't try to make EVA Unit 01 is the day we die
[0:48:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:48:22] <KeroKamina> betray everyone form ore power woolie
[0:48:26] <speximillian> Still have no idea what FEMTO is in this game
[0:48:27] <%LethargicRush> BOOST
[0:48:27] <KeroKamina> your dream
[0:48:28] <Megabyte114> ROCK ON! (and this is potentially the game to sell me on a switch... SO need to see this)
[0:48:31] <prime_name> I look away for a minute and Woolie made an eva-1.
[0:48:32] <+dtogo> some one save that soundbite
[0:48:35] <%Solidnick18> yep
[0:48:36] <@akuda_bar> don't worry about why it's called femto energy
[0:48:38] <SolSwagGuy56> This isn
[0:48:47] <+segatas> Woolie does Eva and I always do Temjin from Virtual On
[0:48:50] <SolSwagGuy56> This isn;t the full game?
[0:48:53] <+NecDW4> Sacrifice your team to win
[0:48:53] <+segatas> no
[0:48:56] <%DashXero> Just like Armored Core.
[0:48:57] <DarkVinceX> no
[0:48:58] <GenoCL> @SolSwagGuy56 no
[0:49:00] <+segatas> Full game is far form out
[0:49:01] <@Solidus_113> Prototype demo
[0:49:05] <%LethargicRush> I always try and go for sinanju
[0:49:07] <%LethargicRush> red black gold
[0:49:10] <Megabyte114> Viper II for life, man... Viper II
[0:49:11] <+segatas> Full gameis months away
[0:49:11] <KTDelgado> but can you chain boosto tho
[0:49:29] <KatabolicRage> this artstyle actually kinda reminds me of breath of the wild for some reason
[0:49:45] <@Solidus_113> !FEMTO ZONE!
[0:49:46] <+wunderkindest> Femto zone
[0:49:47] <KatabolicRage> maybe it's the shading and shadows
[0:49:48] <KeroKamina> i wonder how long before he realizes he can get out of the mech
[0:49:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[0:49:53] <+ArtemisCroc> reaper is one of your friends lol
[0:49:54] <Flunkorg> Thats not an enemie woolie
[0:49:55] <Megabyte114> although to be fair, it wouldnt be out of the range of possibility to want to see Unit 00 in this
[0:49:56] <+segatas> You can change CPU to move faster
[0:49:57] <%DashXero> Umm... That's one of your guys.
[0:49:57] <Finaldragoon> shooting teammates, typical Woolie

[0:50:39] <Xeno351> nobody knows
[0:50:40] <%LethargicRush> more like the casca zone
[0:50:44] <+Dovakhin573> Never want to be in the femto zone for sure
[0:50:44] <morgantj> GRIFFITH
[0:50:45] <%QueequegTheater> It's where we send people who like DMC2
[0:50:46] <+ArtemisCroc> use your radar
[0:50:47] <$FuqBoiSlim> femto let's you revive allies I believe
[0:50:51] <ChortlesJ1> Don't worry about Femto in the demo, it looks like a co op thing
[0:50:53] <+liquidzr0> PowerUpR
[0:50:54] <%TeethMuncher> @KeroKamina they knew what they signed up for
[0:50:56] <+Sir_Louis_of_pillzshire> Stack the mecha to reach the white base in the sky!
[0:50:57] <+Dovakhin573> Youll get sacrafised for someones dream
[0:51:00] <laguerrilha> Is where you banish people?
[0:51:01] <+Eddy21forsaken> its where you sacrifice your friends for more time on the clock
[0:51:06] <+ApocalypticExpress> its the did nothing wrong zone, featuring NotWoolie Shogun
[0:51:37] <simifu> femto cheese?
[0:51:39] <NeroInfinite> Armored Core this is not.
[0:51:50] <+dtogo> You move alot faster when you get better parts.
[0:51:51] <FrustratedAF> still not sure what femto is in this
[0:51:58] <+Tonku_the_Red> NOT AGAIN!
[0:52:03] <+Aullama> danS
[0:52:03] <NeroInfinite> RIP stream
[0:52:03] <%LethargicRush> i like the target lock on look
[0:52:04] <$FuqBoiSlim> uh ohhhh
[0:52:05] <+kraajkase> F
[0:52:06] <+segatas> Same direcor as Armored Core 2 and 3 @NeroInfinite
[0:52:10] <waifoong98> @NeroInfinite doesn't seems to even have boost metre control
[0:52:13] <%DashXero> Unlike AC, you don't get penalized for flight.
[0:52:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, at least I know it isn't my internet that's the issue
[0:52:18] <%kahunaburger1> Missiles have no cool down, just ammo
[0:52:19] <+tweedler92> femto is like moon energy or something, revives teammates
[0:52:19] <+Wildwest_bum> yeah
[0:52:21] <Nazgul240> F, massive frame drops
[0:52:25] <+Grayhammatter> twitch is doing the bad
[0:52:25] <+Qsmash_> frames are dying
[0:52:27] <leoneofthestars> oh noo
[0:52:27] <Zooxf> ll...lag
[0:52:29] <+segatas> F
[0:52:33] <KatabolicRage> I like that, it was a pain in the ass to manage your energy meter in AC
[0:52:33] <@Solidus_113> missiles are very limited in mission if you try and use them for everything
[0:52:37] <+pl0xzz> The frames are entering the femto zone
[0:52:40] <+griffball13> health
[0:52:41] <%kahunaburger1> VP is health
[0:52:42] <KatabolicRage> and if you ran out you were left walking slow as all hell
[0:52:44] <FrustratedAF> healing field, yeah
[0:52:45] <laguerrilha> oof is the stream 1 frame per second for every one?
[0:52:46] <LocoLuco> health
[0:52:47] <waifoong98> @KatabolicRage then you are building your mech wrong heh
[0:52:48] <%linkwolf4> VP is health yeah
[0:52:57] <+segatas> There is no video at all just sound
[0:53:04] <@akuda_bar> it's working now
[0:53:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Try refreshing, folks
[0:53:09] <Rezroc> Jet Set Armoured Core looks cool
[0:53:20] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:53:21] <+griffball13> GRIFFITH
[0:53:22] <+fatal_penguin_> Boost in yo house
[0:53:22] <+cstigerwright> Femto is never explained
[0:53:27] <%kahunaburger1> I think Femto is for Co-op
[0:53:28] <GenoCL> @WoolieVersus No one knows
[0:53:28] <%TeethMuncher> Woolie's Femto meter is always full
[0:53:28] <Xeno351> femto isn't explained in the demo
[0:53:28] <Finaldragoon> Femto is for special weapons that aren't really in the demo
[0:53:29] <+ApocalypticExpress> infested tanks @WoolieVersus
[0:53:30] <Strange_Journey31> Femto is energy to revive a ally
[0:53:33] <@Solidus_113> you can check your HUD settings now, it's crazy in depth
[0:53:33] <GreatJumps> LUL
[0:53:37] <LocoLuco> Woolie STAY STILL ON THE GROUND AND HOLD X!!!!!!!
[0:53:38] <+tweedler92> femto revives teamates
[0:53:39] <KTDelgado> I would love to see this arsenal try to fight a gen 4 (AC4/for answer) AC
[0:53:40] <%Yellowcake1212> ?
[0:53:41] <+liquidzr0> PRChase
[0:53:43] <Nazgul240> I think it's temp HP or temp shield
[0:53:45] <%LethargicRush> the higher your femto meter, the more chances you gain to getting a empire
[0:53:57] <ValidVenasaur> safrice your allies to gain more demo meter
[0:54:00] <+fatal_penguin_> std alert
[0:54:01] <GreatJumps> The femto meter indicates noting wrong
[0:54:02] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus femto only has one use in the demo: to revive allied units
[0:54:03] <%kahunaburger1> Yo Woolie, stay on the ground and hold X
[0:54:05] <KatabolicRage> I can't wait to have a missile launcher in both hands and on both shoulders
[0:54:10] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus Femto in the demo can only revive downed partner mechs. in the full game it's a guess that it'll be used for lazer weapons
[0:54:15] <FrustratedAF> don't forget to loot the mecha corpses Jebaited
[0:54:19] <$PaulToon1990> cheer500 Yo Woolz! Doing good?
[0:54:20] <+segatas> You can scan pictures to decals as well
[0:54:29] <FrustratedAF> there's a sword somewhere
[0:54:32] <+cstigerwright> Also when you get past this and the next level. Enemies will drop random armor pieces and weapons. There's actually a quite a bit of weapons and armor in the demo
[0:54:45] <%LowEnergyStarman> Step into the Zone, FemtoZone
[0:54:49] <@akuda_bar> which is sort of the opposite of what you would expect femto to do
[0:54:52] <+Tonku_the_Red> @WoolieVersus Femto allows you to sacrifice your allies for a better robot!
[0:54:54] <KatabolicRage> all I can think of now is how every AC game has the moonlight blade in it
[0:54:57] <+segatas> yea Mission 2 I farmed a lot of parts by playing multiple times
[0:55:01] <ZeroCount> Griffith!?
[0:55:22] <DarkVinceX> look at your minimap for anything orange?
[0:55:23] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:55:25] <gyrobasel> No Casca's allowed
[0:55:25] <%kahunaburger1> Red map areas are Femto zones
[0:55:28] <+segatas> By the time I got to the demo boss I had 22000 health and he was no problem
[0:55:29] <Nazgul240> femto seems like the minovski particles of this game
[0:55:32] <Strange_Journey31> Femto Zone is better than the twilight Zone
[0:55:33] <Finaldragoon> arrow Woolie
[0:55:33] <%TeethMuncher> behind you
[0:55:35] <%LethargicRush> did this world get taken over by the Qlipoth too?
[0:55:35] <xtremegamer80> God this game needs like a red dot for upclose enemies
[0:55:36] <+Qsmash_> enemies are orange
[0:55:39] <AllenDeadman> behind you woolie
[0:55:41] <+griffball13> femto seems like metatron to me
[0:55:41] <KatabolicRage> there's an orange pip isn't there?
[0:55:43] <gustavozxd> is that a Kirby headphone!?
[0:55:44] <%Eeko390> Woolie nooooo
[0:55:45] <MacMog> femto also gives your guitarist the power to shred
[0:55:45] <GraphicJon> orange arrow
[0:55:45] <KatabolicRage> I think that means enemy
[0:55:51] <GreatJumps> Red is the femto zone
[0:55:53] <KTDelgado> fun fact this Mecha is about the size of the moon light blade
[0:55:53] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus the orange is enemy
[0:55:55] <OUTheTeam> Orange arrow woolz
[0:55:57] <%kahunaburger1> Red on the map just means Femto zone
[0:55:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Orange arrows on the map mean enemies
[0:56:01] <+scrivener_exe> Red is femto, orange dots are enemies
[0:56:06] <Flunkorg> The orange markers woolie
[0:56:07] <%TeethMuncher> Tested positive for mecha
[0:56:11] <%Eeko390> Press x!
[0:56:15] <waifoong98> @KTDelgado so tiny heh
[0:56:18] <+psydaku> femto is for reviving allies, i believe
[0:56:22] <%DashXero> The English VA for this demo isn't bad at all.
[0:56:24] <+Tonku_the_Red> Switch to English, won't need subtitles @WoolieVersus
[0:56:25] <Xeno351> if you made the voice english. it wouldn't be an issue. jsut saying
[0:56:37] <frenchpooper> yyyYYYOOO!!!
[0:56:39] <+dtogo> you can play missions over and over. after getting a bunch of upgrades the game gets a lot faster
[0:56:40] <zamzoph> just use english so you don't have to read subtitles while playing
[0:56:41] <%Eeko390> On the ground I think
[0:56:45] <+segatas> go scan things before the timer runs out
[0:56:45] <@mothmandraws> is there nothing in the HUD edit
[0:56:46] <KTDelgado> it's really small for a mech
[0:56:53] <$KnivesEve> you dweeb xD
[0:56:54] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus get on the groupnd and hold x
[0:56:58] <+psydaku> weeb
[0:57:01] <KatabolicRage> honestly subs is more than just language stuff
[0:57:03] <@Solidus_113> real weeb problems
[0:57:06] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus scan pictures for decals
[0:57:08] <%Eeko390> My b
[0:57:08] <FrustratedAF> yeah there's stuff about this HUD that screams "play on TV" and not tablet :/
[0:57:09] <%kahunaburger1> Sometimes X lets you hop out of the Mech
[0:57:09] <LocoLuco> Hold X while still on the ground
[0:57:10] <+Tonku_the_Red> The English VA is good. Don't be a sub elitist @WoolieVersus
[0:57:10] <SpaceGuntank> fuck subtitles we're in japanese robot land!
[0:57:12] <Finakala> I always have subs on anyway just in case I can't hear what's being said for whatever reason, no matter what language it's in
[0:57:15] <Xeno351> the VA's are real good for the demo surprisingly
[0:57:19] <TheAzureOracle> Weird
[0:57:28] <Strange_Journey31> Femto zones and the Guts ZOnes
[0:57:29] <BigNerdSam> Triangle
[0:57:30] <waifoong98> heh, at least it is not Armored Core 4s, when Ubisoft just stop updating the game so I had to import the JP version
[0:57:32] <@Solidus_113> Azure why are you lying
[0:57:33] <mypalkevin> Woolie's from Quebec, he hates English and will avoid it if possible. He only speaks it as a convenience for us
[0:57:33] <+gael_jebidibah> That's not x
[0:57:37] <Am_Shigar00> To chat: Let Woolie play the way he wants to. If he wants subs, let him enjoy subs.
[0:57:39] <%Chichen> that was a +
[0:57:40] <BigNerdSam> Youre pressing Y, not X
[0:57:45] <MForan98> the dub is good
[0:57:46] <KatabolicRage> oh hey they don't charge you for bullets now
[0:57:50] <%Chichen> or am i confused
[0:57:50] <KatabolicRage> or maybe they will later
[0:57:54] <%Eeko390> Huh, maybe it's not in the intro
[0:58:04] <+Dovakhin573> maybe it was plus
[0:58:05] <MForan98> But they don't have THE RED COMMIT
[0:58:07] <BlackTriStarXO> another L3 R3 situation
[0:58:11] <xtremegamer80> Nope
[0:58:12] <%DashXero> They don't seem to charge for taking damage in this demo version of the game... And they also don't seem to charge for ammo expenditure.
[0:58:13] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus you can scan graffiti on buildings for decals
[0:58:16] <@akuda_bar> press the x x x and the y y y
[0:58:17] <+Grayhammatter> more paint and guns PogChamp
[0:58:19] <+Noponiz> you gotta be grounded and standing still @WoolieVersus
[0:58:23] <KatabolicRage> well, a gun
[0:58:25] <+NemokillerV> they won't talk about it in the tutorial
[0:58:27] <LocoLuco> Its in, but its probably because the battle was over
[0:58:30] <SpaceGuntank> ah yes the old armored core expenses chart at the end of the mission, love those.
[0:58:30] <@Solidus_113> THE LAB
[0:58:33] <$FuqBoiSlim> I don't think u can do it when the mission is over
[0:58:37] <Gutsandlove> i like the lab
[0:58:39] <$FuqBoiSlim> only during it
[0:58:41] <Jakeofalco> Next mission try it
[0:58:43] <Flunkorg> No, they won't.
[0:58:48] <KatabolicRage> this strikes me as a cross between armored core and gundam breaker
[0:58:53] <KatabolicRage> like some kinda amalgamation
[0:58:53] <+SuzakuRising> holding X to exit the mech only happened for me when mech health was at 0
[0:58:54] <Flunkorg> If its what I think it is they'll never show you how to do it.
[0:58:59] <@mothmandraws> does HUD have any size adjustments
[0:59:02] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus Lab before next mission
[0:59:08] <Them00n> @woolieversus I just got here, what is this game?

[1:01:59] <%LethargicRush> yeah you do
[1:02:02] <Xeno351> He did nothing wrong though
[1:02:02] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus "Outer" is the term for you out of your mech
[1:02:04] <simifu> Pa-Femto cheese Kappa
[1:02:04] <+Aullama> Absorb more FEMTO danGachi
[1:02:06] <+XzileGaming> absorb all the femtos
[1:02:06] <$Tuskor13> That is some deviant art terminology
[1:02:07] <%kahunaburger1> Outer means only out of your mech
[1:02:07] <+Dovakhin573> ABSORB THE GODHAND
[1:02:08] <NobleHeart92> get in the robot Shinji, or else Rei will have to do it
[1:02:08] <AncelDeLambert> femto means small
[1:02:15] <+frobeards> outer is outside-mech gameplay
[1:02:16] <bittahjuri> An Armored Core game? At this time of day, at this times of year? Localized entirely within your home?
[1:02:16] <Laironx3> assimilate the Femto
[1:02:18] <+NemokillerV> You can study the blade
[1:02:19] <raizikudo> is this a good game everyone? just checking it out
[1:02:19] <+Comrade_Vladof> Take Femto into you Woolie, you know you want to
[1:02:21] <vexicbayn> absorb the fucking femto Shinji
[1:02:21] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:02:26] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> While you were partying I studied the blade Kappa
[1:02:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:02:28] <TransFearence> Just roll around in the femto, you'll enjoy it
[1:02:35] <MacMog> SURGICALLY enhance?
[1:02:36] <%DashXero> Get rid of your perfectly functioning human eyes for Robot Eyes.
[1:02:36] <Xeno351> ye
[1:02:36] <waifoong98> there is a water bot LUL
[1:02:38] <@Solidus_113> correct
[1:02:38] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus Mech stuff
[1:02:38] <AncelDeLambert> Outer is pilot, otherwise it's mech
[1:02:39] <DarkVinceX> yes, pilot only
[1:02:39] <%Eeko390> Outer is pilot, Arsenal is mech
[1:02:41] <startstoprepeat> blade cuts your arms off and replaces them with swords
[1:02:43] <Azelstahn> It also changes your appearance too
[1:02:43] <%wujak> outer for pilot arsenal is mech
[1:02:45] <ChortlesJ1> Now here comes one of the negatives: unwanted customization
[1:02:45] <+segatas> IT WORKS ON THE MECH
[1:02:45] <bonzosan> be mindful that you have to commit to your chosen skill until skill reset
[1:02:46] <Finaldragoon> @WoolieVersus Outer = Pilot, Arsenal = Mech
[1:02:46] <Finakala> Get eyes on the inside
[1:02:47] <LocoLuco> yes
[1:02:49] <%tank7013> It looks like some of it is for the mech
[1:02:49] <%RioGascar> is femto the r63 yamato???
[1:02:52] <Graywolf_the_45th> I think it affects both
[1:02:55] <+segatas> NO NO NO it does upgrade the mech
[1:02:56] <revenant4444> If you absorb femto, does that make you sacrifice your friends?? Lol
[1:02:57] <+griffball13> outer means pilot it hink
[1:02:57] <%kahunaburger1> The stuff listed Arsenal works on the mech
[1:02:58] <@Solidus_113> get the lockon
[1:03:00] <LocoLuco> Outer abilities are PILOT
[1:03:05] <BlackTriStarXO> If it says Arsenal its for the mech
[1:03:08] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus No, its improves mech
[1:03:10] <+segatas> You want to upgrade the pilot for the mech
[1:03:10] <AncelDeLambert> Arsenal is mech
[1:03:11] <%Eeko390> God damnit read more than the first response
[1:03:21] <+Grayhammatter> you can improve both mech and your pilot
[1:03:21] <Azelstahn> desync?
[1:03:22] <+Noponiz> the sword is SICK
[1:03:24] <KeroKamina> blitz is your automata pod but not as good @WoolieVersus
[1:03:27] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus it upgrades the mech
[1:03:33] <+tweedler92> you get so much money just spend that shit man
[1:03:43] <%DashXero> Yeah. That's pretty much it.
[1:03:47] <Am_Shigar00> you get a little funnel outside of the mech, yes
[1:03:50] <Finaldragoon> yes, your Outer gets fin funnels
[1:03:51] <BigNerdSam> Its the pilot weapon
[1:03:51] <$cureneckbeard> But what if I need it later!
[1:03:56] <+griffball13> it's your gun outside of mech
[1:04:04] <startstoprepeat> funnels!
[1:04:08] <Nazgul240> it's your only infantry weapon
[1:04:08] <LocoLuco> Hold on!
[1:04:10] <Xeno351> it's actually ridiculous how much money you get without a way to spend it
[1:04:12] <+segatas> Now watch what happens to your character
[1:04:13] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus if there was a vergil to your dante eva unit 01 colors what would it be?
[1:04:15] <+XzileGaming> improve your anals
[1:04:30] <QaizerArt> your character looks beefier now
[1:04:32] <Doc1790> BECOME MACHINE
[1:04:34] <+segatas> she is less human. Arms amputated
[1:04:44] <%LethargicRush> ice cream shop?
[1:04:44] <KatabolicRage> I think you picked up a gun for your mecha
[1:04:44] <NeroInfinite> MYstery ice cream shop
[1:04:46] <%LethargicRush> in my hangar?
[1:04:48] <@akuda_bar> That's actually pronounced analgesic, not anal-gesic. Sir, the pills go in your mouth
[1:04:53] <xtremegamer80> Probably another shop in another demo or full game
[1:04:58] <+psydaku> how is the frame rate?
[1:05:01] <%DashXero> Don't talk to the help.
[1:05:04] <waifoong98> flat texture LUL
[1:05:06] <NeroInfinite> We don't talk to outers here.
[1:05:07] <%DashXero> The help doesn't talk to you.
[1:05:11] <+segatas> Your character becomes less human the more more you upgrade your skills and mech @WoolieVersus
[1:05:15] <+Aullama> akuda_bar You're not my doctor danMAD
[1:05:18] <OUTheTeam> Mechanics aren’t people
[1:05:18] <@mothmandraws> nah akuda cool kids put them in the other way
[1:05:38] <%LethargicRush> Immortals is a PRETTY intimidating name
[1:05:38] <zamzoph> REMOVE IMMORTALS
[1:05:40] <%Eeko390> It is unclear
[1:05:41] <NeroInfinite> Immortals a name for the baddies
[1:05:45] <+segatas> well we shall see
[1:05:48] <%DashXero> Well, if we didn't shoot them, they'd be immortal.
[1:05:49] <%Sunditsu> Both
[1:05:53] <Azelstahn> It feels like they're the Obliterators from Last Raven.
[1:05:55] <KeroKamina> i often wonder if we'll ever meet our god and get a chance to kill him
[1:05:59] <LocoLuco> You are fighting the Sentials from the Matrix
[1:06:00] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus Immortals is the term for this universes version of Skynet.
[1:06:01] <+WilderWolfMan> No Gods, No Kings, Only Man
[1:06:03] <+fowlfolk> They're AI overlords so they're kind of immortal
[1:06:04] <KTDelgado> that logo looks super familiar
[1:06:04] <+dtogo> the game will explain
[1:06:05] <Xeno351> i just know this game's community is going to devolve into some federation zeon shit but with more since there are more factions
[1:06:05] <%DashXero> They feel like MTs
[1:06:09] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus They're the guys who made that Mortal Kombat theme song
[1:06:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think immortals are rogue AI
[1:06:14] <%kahunaburger1> woolieF woolieT
[1:06:15] <+segatas> Thing is you maybe becoming the immportals *wink*

[1:08:08] <+segatas> @jorgamund Moon is a major story thing
[1:08:09] <FrustratedAF> loot the dead mechs
[1:08:24] <raven_frame> I think Woolie would prefer Artist’s English voice, but eh that’s up to him.
[1:08:30] <%LethargicRush> yo
[1:08:31] <KatabolicRage> so the black parts of the mech I guess is like a naked chassis you equip armour to?
[1:08:31] <FrustratedAF> you can grab the healing fields
[1:08:33] <+Dovakhin573> Or are the mechs in this universe fueled by demon powah
[1:08:37] <bittahjuri> PogChamp I'M SORRY?
[1:08:39] <LocoLuco> Hold X!!!!!
[1:08:51] <Finakala> YEAHH stop sign slam
[1:08:55] <zamzoph> that sign is huge
[1:09:06] <AncelDeLambert> the melee was so floaty in the demo, I hope they fixed it
[1:09:09] <WackyModder84> Wait, these mechas are only the size of roadsigns?
[1:09:09] <+segatas> Moon blew up and gave the world red crystals which power everything I believe
[1:09:14] <waifoong98> "discount chief overweapon" Kappa
[1:09:17] <Finakala> They're small mechs
[1:09:17] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Fuck YEAHHHHH I always wanted a game like this. Mechs rip out things and use them as weapons Kreygasm
[1:09:26] <$cureneckbeard> smechs

[1:09:52] <Am_Shigar00> This is the mission that Woolie wants subs on anyway.
[1:09:55] <@Solidus_113> you might be able to change the location in HUD settings
[1:09:56] <KeroKamina> good thing this is the mission with char and amuro
[1:09:58] <%LethargicRush> I wish my call sign could be my real name
[1:10:01] <seylumiue> Phew
[1:10:02] <%LethargicRush> and that i had one
[1:10:03] <+dtogo> yea it was hard to pay attention to them while playing
[1:10:03] <%FadingEmber> This is the demo right?
[1:10:07] <KatabolicRage> boy, Johnny is a jobber waiting to happen isn't he?
[1:10:08] <@mothmandraws> if hud lets you put in middle might be good
[1:10:13] <KeroKamina> this is hte demo @FadingEmber
[1:10:13] <+ApocalypticExpress> you left a mech you can loot at the beginning area @WoolieVersus
[1:10:33] <%FadingEmber> @KeroKamina okay thanks

[1:10:43] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> LUL

[1:11:15] <mr_slaide> Woolie the coard.
[1:11:19] <@mothmandraws> again should have checked HUD options
[1:11:20] <mr_slaide> Coward even.
[1:11:24] <GreatJumps> Run it back
[1:11:24] <Rukabuk> Try to make the dialoug bigger in the HUD settings
[1:11:25] <Flunkorg> There is none
[1:11:31] <@mothmandraws> seems more in depth
[1:11:32] <seylumiue> Its in the main menu
[1:11:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:11:34] <+segatas> Don't worry about the FPS this demo is the E3 2018 build
[1:11:36] <+NemokillerV> Did he save?
[1:11:37] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> There's a dialog size option in the HUD
[1:11:39] <mr_slaide> A super coard.
[1:11:40] <@Solidus_113> he didn't save
[1:11:41] <+cstigerwright> It saves your progress as a heads up
[1:11:44] <KeroKamina> massive coard
[1:11:48] <Finaldragoon> the game has autosave
[1:11:50] <Arth__> what is the name of this game?
[1:11:50] <Finakala> One of my friend's surnames is literally Coard
[1:11:53] <+ApocalypticExpress> there's a character in that mission voiced byy Char @WoolieVersus
[1:11:53] <+Grayhammatter> a massive coard
[1:12:00] <KatabolicRage> he knows
[1:12:01] <@Menitta> I really like how this is called "Prototype Missions"
[1:12:04] <DarkVinceX> big coard
[1:12:07] <mr_slaide> You couldn't coar more even if you'd want to.
[1:12:10] <KatabolicRage> people are saying to check hud setting to make the subtitles bigger?
[1:12:21] <@Solidus_113> is coard a slur?

[1:14:03] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:14:06] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Holy shit
[1:14:07] <%TechTurtle7> I forget her name
[1:14:14] <Finakala> Eden of the East was a fun show
[1:14:15] <+Qsmash_> I didn't know this was there at all
[1:14:17] <LTKonnor> That dash is STRONG
[1:14:17] <+Grayhammatter> oh, that's a downed arsenal
[1:14:19] <Finakala> Although the movies were a mess
[1:14:19] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus It's actually kinda viable but you take a lot of damage
[1:14:30] <KeroKamina> your blitz is also powerful enough to kill tanks but it's still faster to use the mech @WoolieVersus
[1:14:31] <bonzosan> You're basically a walking mecha on foot
[1:14:36] <Am_Shigar00> I messed around on foot in the third mission in this demo, didn't seem that useful so far, but maybe I was just using it wrong
[1:14:38] <Xeno351> i really hope they have mech stealing in the final version
[1:14:44] <waifoong98> muh FPS
[1:14:45] <LocoLuco> Loot that bot on the ground
[1:15:09] <Finakala> I bet someone will do a roadsign only run
[1:15:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh neat, I didn't realize that you could toss the signs
[1:15:18] <+cstigerwright> If you get a sword, use it they're really good
[1:15:18] <+segatas> @waifoong98 demo
[1:15:21] <zamzoph> Woolie switched the language so he can hear, but he isn't listening LUL
[1:15:22] <+ApocalypticExpress> loot the robots @WoolieVersus
[1:15:23] <+frobeards> loot the mechs
[1:15:26] <KeroKamina> scavange the downed mech
[1:15:28] <+NemokillerV> @WoolieVersus Loot the robots for parts after you kill them
[1:15:29] <+jorgamund> Four sounds WAY too much like GLaDOS
[1:15:32] <+cstigerwright> And if you can try to find twin smgs, they melt everything
[1:15:33] <Finaldragoon> @WoolieVersus don't forget to loot downed arsenals for gear it's the main source of progression in the demo
[1:15:33] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus loot them mechs
[1:15:38] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus Always remember to loot downed arsenals. They're red with exclamation marks on the map.
[1:15:41] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus Loot the robots you killed.
[1:15:47] <AncelDeLambert> oh no it's VR tetris all over again
[1:15:49] <+Aullama> What ever you say Jamieson Price danGachi
[1:15:54] <%LethargicRush> WOO HOO
[1:15:54] <zamzoph> LETS PARTYYYYYY
[1:15:57] <%LethargicRush> classic dante
[1:16:01] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie can't hear us, he's got airbuds in!
[1:16:03] <+tymetak> WOOHOO this parties gettin CRAZAY
[1:16:04] <KatabolicRage> replace that shield you don't seem to use much?
[1:16:06] <suddenlyscorched> Figured I'd see Woolie in EVA01 colors
[1:16:08] <AllenDeadman> the english voice acting is on point
[1:16:10] <TheWashoutXY> what is this EVA bs?
[1:16:11] <LocoLuco> The humanoid mechs you down will have loot @WoolieVersus
[1:16:13] <+frobeards> then loot them mechs
[1:16:13] <bonzosan> devil may cry!
[1:16:16] <Gutsandlove> the exclamation signs are mecha parts @WoolieVersus
[1:16:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think you can get one from the enemy drops here
[1:16:26] <FrustratedAF> did woolie admit to using JP audio just for Char?
[1:16:27] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus loot the mechs they are the red !
[1:16:27] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:16:34] <lion_oh> This game good at all?
[1:16:37] <jubejube56> Y'know considering how many people make EVA colours for their mechs in games, devs really should just make that a preset
[1:16:40] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus any actual mech you kill you can scavange. red triangles on the mini map
[1:16:40] <+ApocalypticExpress> @WoolieVersus will never get a melee weapon if he doesnt start looting the mechs he's killed
[1:16:44] <BestTeaMaker> someone tell woolie to loot the mechs
[1:16:45] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus loot the mechs with the red !
[1:16:48] <+cstigerwright> @WoolieVersus In AC style, different armor types affect movement and boost
[1:16:50] <KatabolicRage> the ui looks like you only get one shoulder weapon
[1:16:50] <T_Sasquatch> woolie would totally date a mech
[1:16:51] <Jakeofalco> You wanna take parts off mechs the red on the map
[1:16:56] <AncelDeLambert> @lion_oh hard to say, the demo isn't much of a vertical slice
[1:17:00] <TechDragon_Z> TechDragon_Z is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel! 
[1:17:01] <TechDragon_Z> TechDragon_Z gifted a Tier 1 sub to MForan98!

[1:17:32] <phoenix_games87> yo woolz cant wait for the rest of the DMC5 lp on your youtube channel
[1:17:39] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus just so you know, you dont get everything, you only get the part you pick
[1:17:42] <kalinflip> I have never played a good mech game with an intuitive UI
[1:17:48] <@mothmandraws> tech dragon is a cooldude
[1:17:53] <Am_Shigar00> heads up: you now have two guns equiped.
[1:17:53] <kalinflip> HUD
[1:17:55] <AncelDeLambert> I hate the idea of choosing just ONE drop off a body
[1:18:04] <AncelDeLambert> I'd much rather get everything of a smaller pool
[1:18:13] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus the parts you pick up can are taken back to the base to you can equip them
[1:18:13] <+Grayhammatter> well, it is a starting mission, in the demo
[1:18:14] <%komradedog> soundtrack shreds. love it
[1:18:17] <$FuqBoiSlim> press left and right on the d pad to switch weapons
[1:18:19] <+Noponiz> remember, every piece of starting equipment has double minus in every stat
[1:18:20] <+segatas> It it smaller and more arena like
[1:18:21] <+cstigerwright> You can swap between weapons on your arm and weapons on your back for each side
[1:18:23] <neoversi> All we need now is the eva theme running in the background
[1:18:39] <+cstigerwright> You can also throw empty weapons at enemies
[1:18:42] <+Aullama> Don't shoot at Johnny! D:
[1:18:51] <%LethargicRush> what a hero
[1:18:55] <+segatas> Strange this is a Nintendo IP (yes it's listed as one)
[1:19:04] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus You can hold down boost for a longer boost
[1:19:08] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus hold the boost it's more effective
[1:19:27] <+cstigerwright> Sword is stronk

[1:21:35] <FrustratedAF> are you doing it? yes. is it winnable? no.
[1:21:38] <xtremegamer80> Wait until the badasses arrive
[1:21:41] <+blastazoid26> I dig this game but the fps drop is really bad

[1:21:59] <Xeno351> you can boost to dodge

[1:34:32] <+Grayhammatter> let's GO

[1:34:42] <+jorgamund> No one knows for sure, but Woolie intends to find out. RE--
[1:34:42] <%tank7013> It was called a blade in the loot menu but a shield in this menu? That sounds like a bug
[1:34:45] <Sozu_> ds2 all over again distLul
[1:34:46] <+Tearonex> @WoolieVersus you can put on 4 shields on your off hands
[1:34:46] <Fatman2124> U MAD MAN!!!
[1:34:49] <+cstigerwright> Gonna have to use a lot of rockets and grenades
[1:34:51] <%Eeko390> Better check the Pylons
[1:34:53] <+cvp5127> MORE SHIELDS
[1:34:53] <VritraReiRei> They can't hurt you, but you can't hurt them! :D
[1:34:58] <Ipsenscastle> this is going to turn out more boring than you think it is
[1:35:00] <+paladinstarbuster> I dont know about this idea

[1:36:12] <+fowlfolk> You can put the weapons on the back just in case
[1:36:13] <+shadowace2400> BTW if you need a weapon mid mission, pick up a lamp post
[1:36:23] <+MagickBurritoh> dual shield
[1:36:26] <%TechTurtle7> That revengemce boss I forget his name
[1:36:27] <+Qsmash_> What about the sword?
[1:36:28] <CuttleCrow> 400% shields
[1:36:28] <+segatas> or cars
[1:36:30] <+Exyoh> The default guns are so bad. The machine gun outdoes it by multitudes

[1:37:49] <SpiritsRiseR2> @WoolieVersus that white Grim Reaper rifle will fire automatically without you pressing anything as long as something is in your line of fire
[1:37:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> just use an emulator
[1:37:51] <+shadowace2400> Once again, super pointless in the face of mechs, but still neat

[1:42:56] <%neooneshin> WHAT?
[1:42:58] <%Solidnick18> Yep
[1:43:02] <%laserbeaming> Too bad Warframe is the Antithesis of why Woolie plays games LUL
[1:43:03] <%DashXero> Compared to the manga, how is Part 5?
[1:43:07] <+Tennochief> lol
[1:43:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That good? I really gotta catch up on the anime
[1:43:08] <masterfire23> the ed is PogChamp

[1:43:32] <PsychoFlash1> @DashXero really faithful, probably better since now they have voices
[1:43:37] <CuttleCrow> Part 5 animated is great, a lot more makes sense
[1:43:40] <aimlesshealer> I love that kind of thing, too
[1:43:42] <MiskatonicAlum> like the American Gods OP sorta

[1:44:15] <+Grayhammatter> welp
[1:44:17] <MiskatonicAlum> they gave us two explanations and i still dont understand King Crimson
[1:44:18] <dukenux> Did you know, that Jodeci released an album in Japan with JoJo cover art?

[1:44:36] <CuttleCrow> also the main cast has a lot more characterization that sticks in part 5 when animated
[1:44:40] <mayorrev> ! VOD AT RISK !
[1:44:42] <+fizzguy47> is this full game
[1:44:43] <$Louie_Salmon> The fact that animation moves from moment to moment is all King Crimson needed, it almost makes sense now

[1:50:26] <+Tennochief> JET SET RADIO
[1:50:26] <dsauce999> milord
[1:50:28] <%Solidnick18> savior
[1:50:31] <+cstigerwright> DAE love Artist?
[1:50:31] <%laserbeaming> Savior is a douche
[1:50:33] <pinxinguinha> @T_Sasquatch but did he scheduled the dmc5 stream?
[1:50:35] <Gutsandlove> yeah
[1:50:36] <+MagickBurritoh> savior is a MC
[1:50:37] <filialpails> are we the baddies?
[1:50:38] <%linkwolf4> look at this Lucio concept art over here
[1:50:40] <%TechTurtle7> faction emblems
[1:50:46] <+Papafleish> we got guns empress and savior walking around and this boy called himself artist really now
[1:50:53] <BakedPretzels> oh hey now I'll know what the fuck you guys have been talking about when you say daemon x machina
[1:50:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Artist is a cool dude
[1:50:56] <starotter70> Not even a one book
[1:51:00] <$Louie_Salmon> There's about to be like 10 cool people introduced in the next 20 minutes
[1:51:07] <+megaryanx> Hey Woolie have you seen Dragon Marked for Death? Its a rpg by the Megaman Zero people.
[1:51:12] <Giothegame> This is the demo right?
[1:51:20] <+cstigerwright> Yas
[1:51:21] <xtremegamer80> They might one day
[1:51:22] <Doc1790> Oh hey Lucio
[1:51:22] <VanLynx> because HE has that haor
[1:51:23] <GenoCL> You can have it IRL tho
[1:51:23] <+Grayhammatter> oh, they actually have different skulls for every person too
[1:51:27] <%FadingEmber> Not anime enough
[1:51:27] <+MagickBurritoh> They might add it in before the game is done
[1:51:29] <%commanderclaw> Cause the only black people friendly CaC are Sports games
[1:51:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:51:30] <+burritocheetos> maybe u should put that in feedback floe1 they'll add it maybe
[1:51:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AMaidIndeed
[1:51:35] <+Qsmash_> you'll get black hairstyles one day Woolie
[1:51:36] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus If you just change your hair, more video games will have your hair in it
[1:51:38] <+tweedler92> I'm sure there's going to be more hair options in that full game
[1:51:39] <%TechTurtle7> ITS ABOUT TO GO DOWN
[1:51:40] <%laserbeaming> They might add more hairstyles in the full game?
[1:51:40] <+Tennochief> the adeptus mechanicus skull would fit well here
[1:51:40] <SpaceGuntank> send a message to the twitter, "we need better mech colors and dread locks!"
[1:51:41] <+BlackSheepAries> LUL just take a photo of yourself and inject it into the code
[1:51:45] <GreatJumps> Only one dreads character per game
[1:51:47] <rainwater739> Can we expect more of DMC5 or RE2?
[1:51:49] <dsauce999> No Woolie, then it cannot relate to the average Japanese young adult.
[1:52:09] <+Tennochief> like porn
[1:52:10] <@Solidus_113> look at these losers talking about nothing
[1:52:11] <+MagickBurritoh> like porn
[1:52:16] <%DashXero> Savior is "that guy."
[1:52:18] <Deadpool2450> like video games Kappa
[1:52:20] <zamzoph> he looks too old to be a main character
[1:52:20] <reiju_22> girl looks like a monster hunter
[1:52:20] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @KeroKamina
[1:52:31] <GreatJumps> LUL

[1:52:49] <+Tyonidus> LUL
[1:52:49] <masterfire23> lucio is probably the only overwatch character that could probably benefit from a controller :)
[1:52:55] <Doc1790> Savior is a weirdo
[1:52:57] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:52:58] <%TheShal> I've related to almost every character I've played, despite none of them looking or acting like me.
[1:53:02] <+shadowace2400> I mean, I have difficulty connecting with women characters
[1:53:02] <%laserbeaming> LUL
[1:53:04] <+Tyonidus> To be fair neither have I, fat neckbeard weaboos aren't really protagonist material dude
[1:53:10] <+Tearonex> idk what you're talking about, I can totally relate to Dante in every way
[1:53:11] <$Louie_Salmon> Main characters always look like me, it's very nice :)

[1:53:22] <+shadowace2400> I have trouble reading books with women leads because I have trouble getting in their shoes
[1:53:23] <Doc1790> Also I can't believe his name is Savior. Pretentious prick.
[1:53:24] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus Aizen
[1:53:26] <+Grayhammatter> why not name him artist?
[1:53:26] <Sloavon> this boy is deep

[2:12:47] <KeroKamina> good thing you can redo this
[2:12:49] <$FuqBoiSlim> damn
[2:12:50] <guzm0n> but muh shields he said
[2:12:52] <rhus> THANKS SAVIOR
[2:12:54] <+Tennochief> it's ok Woolie
[2:13:03] <+fatal_penguin_> You beat the video game
[2:13:08] <+cstigerwright> Not enough shields, need two more
[2:13:09] <%Eaglestrike117> Woolie it took a shitload of damage cause of your shields
[2:13:09] <%DashXero> It can be done... In theory.
[2:13:11] <Sunditsu> I sure am glad Savior did so much work Kappa
[2:13:15] <zamzoph> WE DID IT PogChamp
[2:13:18] <+Grayhammatter> if only you could shield bash
[2:13:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You need to equip more shields, Woolie
[2:13:28] <guzm0n> get back in there with all shields all the time
[2:13:37] <%silvery_cricket> Get swords
[2:13:37] <+Tennochief> that's one fat ass
[2:13:39] <%DashXero> Oh wow. Robot arm.
[2:13:39] <+Grayhammatter> look at this dumb robot
[2:13:40] <+MagickBurritoh> the missiles can take out a whole swathe of tanks
[2:13:40] <mayorrev> you tried
[2:13:41] <waifoong98> Leg too skinny Kappa
[2:13:43] <$FuqBoiSlim> are we still doing apex tonite???
[2:13:44] <AncelDeLambert> it might be viable once you get your secondary weapon pod
[2:13:46] <+fatal_penguin_> Its a Mobile Garbage Compactor
[2:13:47] <@akuda_bar> needs more shields
[2:13:49] <zamzoph> IT LOOKED COOL THO LUL
[2:13:49] <+Exyoh> Mr. Gorbachev, unequip this wall
[2:13:57] <+RushUnplugged> shields are like the RE2 knife
[2:13:57] <0rond> @WoolieVersus HEY your robot can shovel snow like it's nobody's business!
[2:14:02] <AncelDeLambert> @Exyoh LUL
[2:14:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> man mk11 baraka is kinda neat
[2:14:03] <%silvery_cricket> screw apex giant robot slap fights forever
[2:14:08] <Sunditsu> what you gotta do is pit shields on your shields
[2:14:08] <+MagickBurritoh> best defense is overwhelming offense
[2:14:17] <+fatal_penguin_> This Orbital Garbage Compactor Mech build
[2:14:21] <%aishman> It looked like the coolest
[2:14:21] <+Tennochief> you should make an Imperial Knight mech next time
[2:14:25] <+VashyronM> don't need shields if everyone is dead
[2:14:30] <+Tennochief> it would be super cool
[2:14:37] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Shinji! Get in the fucking robot!
[2:14:38] <%silvery_cricket> now get 4 swords
[2:14:42] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus If only you could be Full Armor Gundam
[2:14:45] <%silvery_cricket> and swing them all at once
[2:14:48] <%TechTurtle7> All I hear is juiz when four is talkling I cant not hear it
[2:14:53] <KeroKamina> the enemy is here, look over the wall
[2:14:58] <waifoong98> who needs shield when you can dodge Kappa
[2:15:00] <%aishman> Also how are you liking the game so far Woolie? I just came in like..10 minutes ago
[2:15:28] <+ApocalypticExpress> so can you even kill reaper or only sif. I tried focusing on Reaper once cuz I wanted his beam sabre but he wouldn't die, and then Sif died quickly
[2:15:40] <gustavozxd> man this character could not be more black than he already is
[2:15:47] <KeroKamina> Savior is the guy who doesn't do shit in a group project
[2:15:56] <+cstigerwright> @ApocalypticExpress Pretty sure you can't.
[2:16:00] <Ion_LaserX> @KeroKamina and expects an A regardless
[2:16:13] <KeroKamina> whiel watchign his animes
[2:16:22] <%DashXero> Savior is Bless.
[2:16:25] <+Tennochief> @Ion_LaserX and give everybody else a 1/5 on group participation
[2:16:30] <+cstigerwright> GOtta get the sword then you can get up in those tanks
[2:16:31] <metaknight23> Is this a demo?
[2:16:33] <%aishman> So that red shit is your energy for when you wanna get out of the mech
[2:16:39] <%aishman> And yes, you can get out of the mech and fight
[2:16:50] <KeroKamina> @metaknight23 it's the demo yes
[2:16:51] <dukenux> Is getting late here, so gotta go. bye
[2:16:54] <+ApocalypticExpress> @cstigerwright ah ok thanks
[2:16:59] <+Tennochief> bye
[2:17:00] <%laserbeaming> This game has some cool UI customization options
[2:17:05] <metaknight23> I was looking on the eshop for it but can't find it :(
[2:17:06] <%laserbeaming> like UI scaling
[2:17:08] <%TechTurtle7> oh yeah titfall it for a bit but not as fun
[2:17:20] <%TechTurtle7> titanfall*
[2:17:21] <%laserbeaming> I think it's the first console game I've played with UI scaling
[2:17:22] <+OceanGovernor> I dont think you can download the demo any more
[2:17:27] <+Exyoh> They even have drops, & the mission ends earlier when you kill one, but it's difficult as all hell to do it until you grind some good equipment
[2:17:29] <+Grayhammatter> bummer
[2:17:48] <+Grayhammatter> YIKES
[2:17:51] <+burritocheetos> yeah, they pulled the demo from the eshop, so i think they got all the feedback they needed
[2:17:52] <DarkVinceX> oh shit
[2:17:53] <+Tennochief> fuck
[2:17:54] <KeroKamina> CONTINUE THE MISSION FUCKER
[2:17:56] <th3madness> UPGRADE YO SHIT
[2:17:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, that could've gone better
[2:18:03] <+Tennochief> punch the tanks
[2:18:03] <+cstigerwright> I believe
[2:18:04] <+MagickBurritoh> Shoot the health
[2:18:05] <+cstigerwright> You got this
[2:18:10] <+MagickBurritoh> HEALTH BY YOUR MECH
[2:18:12] <Xeno351> drop your shield, into a dumpster and just dodge while dual wielding
[2:18:13] <@akuda_bar> i don't remember this mission being difficult rofl
[2:18:16] <TheAzureOracle> Hold to charge
[2:18:17] <%VariantX7> i didn't know that was possible to get out of the mech...
[2:18:22] <+VashyronM> Hijack Savior's mech. He's not using it
[2:18:24] <+fatal_penguin_> Is this Titanfall 2
[2:18:27] <+burritocheetos> u need more femto to repair ur mech
[2:18:27] <PaulToon1990> Suddenly Earth Defense Force.
[2:18:29] <%TechTurtle7> it be cool to have wallrunning and
[2:18:32] <$FuqBoiSlim> it's harder either the default parts
[2:18:34] <%aishman> You need to get Femto
[2:18:35] <KeroKamina> the mission's real easy but only after liek the second or third try
[2:18:36] <+Exyoh> The most awkward thing about this game is how unclear the fact that you should replay for drops is
[2:18:39] <waifoong98> Pffttt, if this was AC Verdict Day, your customised AI would have finished the mission for you instead LUL
[2:18:42] <+MagickBurritoh> WOW you're durable
[2:18:57] <mr_miyagichu> Is this the full game?
[2:18:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just kill the mechs on foot, it's fiiiiiine B-)
[2:18:58] <startadevy> KAPOW
[2:18:59] <+ApocalypticExpress> its a monster hunter like game with mechs
[2:19:05] <%laserbeaming> I think you can drop mines, but I don't remember
[2:19:05] <+segatas> This mission is why I farmed mission 2 a bunch to the point my mech was stong with 22000 health then this and the boss became easy
[2:19:10] <+ApocalypticExpress> u need moar Femto energy @WoolieVersus
[2:19:16] <+cstigerwright> Its kinda cool seeing them fight like that while you're on the ground
[2:19:17] <+Spiralofvertigo> "Monster Hunter game with mechs" is all I need to hear
[2:19:18] <SGrim> So Woolie's chosen pilot is just tan Rei? I dig it. rooPog
[2:19:27] <Flunkorg> @segatas I passed this mission barely awake... how do you suck this bad?
[2:19:27] <%aishman> That red shit? GEEET IT
[2:19:27] <Gutsandlove> this is not the full game
[2:19:33] <waifoong98> Get more Rorbs Kappa
[2:19:34] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:19:49] <SGrim> Quick, find Casca... oh I made myself sad rooCry
[2:19:49] <+burritocheetos> the bar beneath your heealth bar indicated femto
[2:19:53] <+cstigerwright> You absord it by just being around the red rocks
[2:19:59] <mr_miyagichu> Ah ok thanks @gutsandlove
[2:20:07] <Flunkorg> Just restart
[2:20:08] <+Exyoh> If you get the sword and rush Sif or Reaper, you can trap them in knockdown and pile on the damage til they explode and drop something decent
[2:20:09] <Xeno351> it's better at this point just to die. they haven't implemented anything in the demo to justify to keep going as the pilot
[2:20:16] <+Tennochief> oh no
[2:20:17] <waifoong98> tanks get destroy by some drones, why even bother Kappa
[2:20:18] <%TechTurtle7> femto , femtoing, the study of femto.
[2:20:23] <%aishman> Oh they haven't implemented it in the demo? Dang
[2:20:25] <revenant4444> Sacrifice your friends for more femto energy
[2:20:28] <+thesw1tch> dunban is around here somewhere
[2:20:34] <%TechTurtle7> its first grade
[2:20:40] <%DashXero> They can be handled with the default equipment though.
[2:20:40] <+Tonku_the_Red> You gotta stay around that library like a fungus, @WoolieVersus
[2:20:41] <+segatas> This is the downside to some of this game is you want to farm parts like crazy
[2:20:50] <%DashXero> Quite easily handled with the default equipment.
[2:20:53] <%aishman> Don't forget to activate the shield
[2:20:56] <$FuqBoiSlim> it sucks cuz you can revive allies but the allies wont revive you
[2:21:03] <%laserbeaming> You can buy an upgrade that gives you a sword in pilot form! It's not great though
[2:21:19] <+wizardsloth1> Kappa
[2:21:24] <+Exyoh> Yeah, the difficulty spike in the last couple demo missions made new parts a requirement for me
[2:21:34] <%laserbeaming> You can switch to pilot anytime by holding X I think. You can set mines
[2:21:34] <+Exyoh> Took so long to get the good machine guns
[2:21:37] <+segatas> yeah I love melee in games but I abandoned melee in this game in favor of a machine gun and a hand cannon
[2:21:52] <+MagickBurritoh> Don't bother going far from the building
[2:22:05] <%TechTurtle7> yeah this needs better melee
[2:22:08] <Xeno351> so randomly having shields extra shields/ weapons weighs you down. also the shield is just bad in this game.
[2:22:19] <+cstigerwright> Don't forget you can throw weapons when the run out of ammo by using the Purge arrow
[2:22:20] <%laserbeaming> The sword in this game is not great. It's useful as a sidearm though
[2:22:32] <+MagickBurritoh> the sword is strong, but slow
[2:22:44] <+Exyoh> The sword is *amazing* for Sif & Reaper, but the other weapons outdo it for everything else
[2:22:46] <%laserbeaming> It is strong, but if feels bad to use
[2:22:49] <+earthboy2k> wasn't evangelion supposed to be on netflix by now
[2:23:01] <+cstigerwright> Its like a two hit kill with no ammo
[2:23:12] <$FuqBoiSlim> it's good for hitting weak points on the 4th mission boss but I cant justify using it regularly
[2:23:24] <%laserbeaming> I hope they improve melee fighting in the final game

[2:23:31] <Gutsandlove> GET THE PARTS

[2:24:11] <Gutsandlove> true
[2:24:20] <+Tennochief> see you guys later, bye
[2:24:21] <+MagickBurritoh> Put both guns on both arms
[2:24:35] <+Exyoh> Getting one or two parts without risking the mission will save you later
[2:24:38] <Xeno351> i doesn't really feel like the swords are too weak. i think the guns are just too strong. I mean why even give yourself a chance of getting hit.
[2:24:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Do a Giga Drill Breaker
[2:25:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Buy 40 microtransactions to improve your odds for FUN Kappa
[2:25:19] <waifoong98> needs more Armored Core 1 shot pile bunker Kappa
[2:25:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Real life needs more anime plotlines
[2:25:41] <+segatas> @Breakfast_Megapowers there has been no indication Microtransactions will be a thing in this at all
[2:25:42] <+alphonseisbest> man, this is making me wanna go watch so Gundam

[2:27:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gotta kill those enemy mechs and steal their faces
[2:27:45] <+segatas> Forget Reaper
[2:27:54] <+cstigerwright> @WoolieVersus Reaper can't be killed
[2:27:56] <+MagickBurritoh> KILL THAT GUY AND TAKE HIS SWORD
[2:27:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Fear the reaper
[2:28:03] <$FuqBoiSlim> Go for Sif, if you knock her down you're almost guaranteed to get her sword
[2:28:12] <+segatas> Reaper has Cowbell power
[2:28:24] <DarkKnightGrave> Thiccer Zarya
[2:28:31] <TheAzureOracle> You can make him run away but then you don't get any loot
[2:28:33] <GraphicJon> yeah but if you attack him, Jonny will get Sif in time
[2:28:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I love that IGPX drifting the mech is doing
[2:28:42] <+JavaManJoJo> wait, why does one of Woolie's bars say FEMTO?
[2:28:43] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus btw, the shield does nothing in the demo. You're basically wasting a slot.
[2:28:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Y I K E S
[2:29:00] <TheAzureOracle> FEMTO is a type of fuel for certain weapons
[2:29:06] <TheAzureOracle> That's the FEMTO bar
[2:29:06] <+MagickBurritoh> LOOT
[2:29:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @JavaManJoJo because Femto has nothing wrong with it
[2:29:07] <%DashXero> Grab her parts!
[2:29:07] <%aishman> Go for the body!
[2:29:10] <+segatas> Yup best to dump sheilds

[2:29:55] <%DashXero> Just Sif.
[2:29:55] <+MagickBurritoh> only Sif
[2:29:55] <KeroKamina> just sif
[2:29:56] <+burritocheetos> just Sif
[2:29:56] <+segatas> just the one
[2:29:56] <+Grayhammatter> just sif i think?
[2:29:59] <%aishman> Just siff
[2:30:01] <DarkVinceX> just sif
[2:30:02] <+segatas> just sif yeah
[2:30:03] <%aishman> But get that rare part though!
[2:30:06] <%VariantX7> i think Sif has a melee as a possible drop
[2:30:10] <%aishman> Man now I wanna play this demo again. I can't WAIT for the full thing

[2:38:33] <+Vetto> So.. Armored core?
[2:38:33] <+MagickBurritoh> sparkles
[2:38:34] <%DashXero> Oh yeah. The shield is a thing.
[2:38:49] <Morning_Asakura> guilty gear makes more sense
[2:38:51] <%QueequegTheater> Is there anywhere I can watch Devil May Cry anime? It's not on Crunchyroll

[2:38:59] <$FuqBoiSlim> those kill la kill stars
[2:39:07] <%TechTurtle7> Its a big ol' spider moose

[2:39:10] <WaterBoardKickflip> So is this better than ZoE or nah
[2:39:19] <Flunkorg> @QueequegTheater Have you tried sailing the seven seas?
[2:39:24] <+Grayhammatter> woof
[2:39:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @QueequegTheater find a friend to legally lend it to you through a lending link
[2:39:26] <+cstigerwright> @WaterBoardKickflip Two different things entirely
[2:39:27] <+Exyoh> Is the DMC anime on Netflix?
[2:39:27] <%TechTurtle7> it has four legs nvm
[2:39:30] <%DashXero> Legs damaged.
[2:39:30] <+segatas> @WaterBoardKickflip it's a demo and different type of game
[2:39:31] <Laironx3> Also reminded me of Botw guardians' laser
[2:39:36] <MacMog> take out those fwingers
[2:39:36] <@Commando_Joe> Two very different games @WaterBoardKickflip
[2:39:42] <+paladinstarbuster> dmc anime free on psn
[2:39:42] <%TechTurtle7> its a big ol' robo moose
[2:39:47] <+segatas> @Exyoh DMC anime is free with PS+
[2:39:51] <KeroKamina> @WaterBoardKickflip it's almost as good as armored core for answer but it's really rough
[2:40:12] <+Grayhammatter> y'know?
[2:40:12] <waifoong98> "believe" my arse
[2:40:16] <WaterBoardKickflip> So what IS it? Mech Monster Hunter?
[2:40:17] <KeroKamina> you gotta believe !
[2:40:18] <%QueequegTheater> Believe in your ability to get shot iin the fucking face
[2:40:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> DMC anime should cost -.99
[2:40:25] <+Exyoh> The knees have weakpoints if you don't want to sit underneath
[2:40:25] <revenant4444> You don't need Ps+ for the devil may cry anime, i got it without having + at all
[2:40:35] <+segatas> @WaterBoardKickflip Demo for the new Nintendo published IP Daemon X Machina
[2:40:36] <xtremegamer80> @WoolieVersus You have to shoot the weakpoints on the sides of the laser cannon, only exposed after it fires
[2:40:40] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus there's healign on some of the edges of the map
[2:40:53] <+cstigerwright> Also be very careful about the Out Of Bounds area. The boss can essentially stun lock you into it if you corner yourself
[2:40:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:40:57] <%QueequegTheater> hit it til it dies
[2:41:00] <@Menitta> Man, all these black and red mechs in the empty desert makes Woolie's mech look so out of place lol
[2:41:02] <+paladinstarbuster> weakpoints underneath too
[2:41:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> !motivated
[2:41:03] <@Moobot> 214 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:41:04] <%QueequegTheater> BIG COWARD
[2:41:14] <+Exyoh> @WoolieVersus shooting off the kneecaps gives you 4 extra weakpoints
[2:41:31] <+thegamekirby98> How has Daemon X Machina been? Been thinking of trying/buying the game
[2:41:35] <+cstigerwright> @WoolieVersus underbelly has big and easy weakpoints
[2:41:36] <Finaldragoon> it has a ton of weakpoints on the underside
[2:41:39] <SpaceGuntank> i love the fact that it has nobless oblige style wings
[2:41:41] <%DashXero> Careful. Once you've taken out the laser cannon, it kinda goes berserk.
[2:41:46] <WaterBoardKickflip> Getting God Eater vibes
[2:41:55] <%QueequegTheater> woolie try not getting hit while hitting it
[2:41:57] <+MagickBurritoh> DO THE LASER
[2:42:04] <+segatas> @thegamekirby98 demo is fun but the game isn't out for a while
[2:42:04] <%aishman> So for the laser, see those pods around the head? You want to fire at those.
[2:42:10] <+burritocheetos> it also has Underbelly Weakpoints
[2:42:15] <TheAzureOracle> He has a bunch of weak points in his underbelly
[2:42:17] <%DashXero> Getting rid of the laser makes it 50% less predictable.
[2:42:21] <+MagickBurritoh> too bad it's not firing much
[2:42:24] <%aishman> It's just one big ol' weakness maching
[2:42:24] <DeathGodSkeith> woolie how you likin this game. i think its sick as hell
[2:42:44] <%QueequegTheater> use Royal release
[2:42:58] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus you can also just go under it and shoot the tons of weakpoints under it. laser weakpoint only damagable after it uses it's lazer
[2:42:58] <%aishman> Also remember, if you are low on ammo kill the grunts
[2:42:59] <+segatas> Yeah just use Royal Gaurd :P
[2:43:29] <+jorgamund> "Captain, are you sure we need so many weak points on this machine?" "well, that's what the blueprints call for, I ain't asking questions."
[2:43:31] <+MagickBurritoh> Laser has a s e c r e t
[2:43:31] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie chat is dumb
[2:43:35] <%QueequegTheater> 3
[2:43:37] <+paladinstarbuster> no listen too him
[2:43:39] <Morning_Asakura> 3
[2:43:40] <+Grayhammatter> never listen to chat
[2:43:50] <xtremegamer80> @jorgamund That, but with the dial up noise
[2:43:53] <xeros720> given how i can't download this anymore, i'd like to see the cool thing
[2:43:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Do backflips over the Mech

[2:44:44] <+fatal_penguin_> If solid snake could do it, you can
[2:44:47] <+Exyoh> I didn't even know you could shoot the laser. I did the knees and underside
[2:44:48] <%TechTurtle7> yeyeye LETS GO
[2:44:49] <%yeknomlive> it looks like nier automata
[2:44:50] <+shadowace2400> get closer to hit it with your sword

[2:44:59] <+detbasil> Whoa, how'd he get out of the suit?
[2:45:03] <+shadowace2400> wait, do you have the sword arm?
[2:45:05] <Graxe_> Snake and Raiden could do it, so can you.
[2:45:07] <bonzosan> the pilot is actually really good
[2:45:08] <+Grayhammatter> the opened way plays LUL
[2:45:12] <%TechTurtle7> CHARACTER ACTION SOTC

[2:45:12] <%QueequegTheater> @detbasil SUit is kill
[2:45:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> AGRO, AGRO
[2:45:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> (Not Dead Yet)
[2:45:32] <+detbasil> Oh is that what happens? @QueequegTheater I've never had that happen
[2:45:33] <+NemokillerV> Use the blade skills that you studied
[2:45:35] <ItsJustReiter> Spirit of Motherwill???
[2:45:35] <+Noxybaru> MY LEGS AIN'T BROKE YET
[2:45:35] <KeroKamina> hold dash button to run faster, jump to let your pilot stamina last longer @WoolieVersus
[2:45:36] <+segatas> if SOTC had mechs it would be a better game. change my mind
[2:45:46] <Saltmeisterr> hope is mech game
[2:45:49] <presque> shooting at the laser when weak points aren't out is pointless
[2:45:51] <+Grayhammatter> welp
[2:45:53] <Saltmeisterr> how is mech game
[2:45:55] <Finakala> Any game with mechs would be better than the same game without mechs
[2:46:01] <@Menitta> The sound effects of your bones crunching
[2:46:05] <%tank7013> That was such a good knockback LUL
[2:46:07] <GenoCL> Yeah, get a mech game to play as the human alright Kappa
[2:46:10] <+cstigerwright> Ya allmost got it just a little more
[2:46:11] <%QueequegTheater> You clearly don't believe in yourself enough Woolie
[2:46:14] <Finaldragoon> @WoolieVersus most of the time you were shooting the platform below the laser doing almost no damage
[2:46:28] <Finakala> Get mech game to play as a human? Is this Titanfall?
[2:46:28] <Saltmeisterr> where is mech tho
[2:46:32] <+Exyoh> Getting the mech parts from the previous mission took the weight off with his mission, but it's a shame that you kinda need to grind
[2:46:40] <vVAstrAVv> does doing the lazer get him a weapon or something?
[2:46:40] <+MagickBurritoh> ded
[2:46:41] <+cstigerwright> You can also charge the little person laser
[2:46:42] <+burritocheetos> LUL
[2:46:42] <+Grayhammatter> oops, and dead
[2:46:43] <%QueequegTheater> Nah she's fine
[2:46:45] <@Menitta> You got some good hits in
[2:46:48] <+fatal_penguin_> You did it
[2:46:48] <GenoCL> @WoolieVersus Are you getting SRW T in a couple of days? Are you hype for Bebop and Harlock? PogChamp
[2:46:53] <waifoong98> just stand under it Kappa
[2:46:54] <SubjectX07x> This game fully out or demo?
[2:46:54] <Taiyz> Taiyz subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:47:02] <mr_miyagichu> Demo
[2:47:02] <%aishman> Demo
[2:47:05] <%TechTurtle7> its doable tho it feels
[2:47:07] <+segatas> retry gives less money I think
[2:47:07] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus how you enjoying the game?
[2:47:09] <%aishman> So how are you liking the game so far man?
[2:47:11] <SubjectX07x> Ahh, thank ya.
[2:47:12] <%QueequegTheater> Hey did I miss Woolie reading subs
[2:47:13] <Cata_2136> better than my first run
[2:47:15] <Josef_Stryker> We got some good hits in boys apatSmug
[2:47:15] <%UrsulaCat> woolie did good
[2:47:19] <+MagickBurritoh> now we got a plan
[2:47:26] <+segatas> best to go back to base and start over if you want full pay
[2:47:34] <xtremegamer80> @WoolieVersus Yeye, and you could totally access it and aim it wherever.
[2:47:52] <Sunditsu> Yeah, I didn't like the auto lock on weapon either
[2:47:57] <bonzosan> This song sounds like the Street Fighter X Tekken character select!
[2:47:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:48:04] <%DashXero> Baiting this thing into firing the laser is a pain in the ass.
[2:48:06] <+MagickBurritoh> @WoolieVersus the laser weakpoints only show up after firing
[2:48:07] <%TechTurtle7> it def needs hard lock on
[2:48:09] <+Grayhammatter> they only exist when it fires the laser
[2:48:10] <+cstigerwright> @WoolieVersus The face laser weakpoints only come out after it uses the laser
[2:48:16] <%aishman> They're out now!
[2:48:17] <Graxe_> They only pop out when the laser's gonna shoot, it looked like.
[2:48:22] <noobpsyboticus> @woolieversus maybe try going a bit longer range to proceed the laser
[2:48:23] <vVAstrAVv> get in front and bait thelazer fire
[2:48:24] <+segatas> They are out
[2:48:31] <noobpsyboticus> proc it I mean
[2:48:34] <+CptnCampy61> This game looks so dope
[2:48:34] <%aishman> They're out after the lasers fire
[2:48:39] <+segatas> When the laser fired the pink weakpoints appear
[2:49:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Use the Mech to your advantage!
[2:49:20] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus lazer points only pop out after the lazer is fired and only last about 5 seconds before they retract
[2:49:24] <%TheShal> Now that's what I call big damage
[2:49:27] <%QueequegTheater> so is that
[2:49:32] <%TechTurtle7> HIT ITS WEAK POINT FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE
[2:49:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Now thats what I call BIG Damage
[2:49:43] <revenant4444> +
[2:49:46] <gustavozxd> that's what we like to call BRAIN DAMAGE
[2:49:48] <+CptnCampy61> Already more interesting than anthem
[2:49:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Giant Enemy Crabs
[2:50:03] <revenant4444> Oops lol

[2:50:44] <KeroKamina> coulda been worse, i once got softlockedi n this fight because of stuff liek htat
[2:50:46] <+segatas> @TheValiantBob No

[2:54:05] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus Shields do work but you have to actually put them up which you haven't been doing
[2:54:12] <+fatal_penguin_> Double shields would of worked great here
[2:54:23] <+segatas> You get more ammo killing smaller enemies

[2:56:32] <xeros720> lol
[2:56:33] <TheAzureOracle> IT'S FIIIIIIIIIIIINE
[2:56:36] <Laironx3> Whiff of the ages
[2:56:38] <%QueequegTheater> start over
[2:56:39] <%TechTurtle7> DAT DODGE
[2:56:40] <vVAstrAVv> lol OOOOF COURSE
[2:56:40] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus after the lazer is shot off he's in a dazed state for about 10-15 seconds
[2:56:41] <waifoong98> oh not I shot on the floor tiles Kappa
[2:56:45] <Finaldragoon> @WoolieVersus you're supposed to grab the laser the instant you blow it off because it is stunned for an extended time
[2:56:46] <+Grayhammatter> woolie blew his load too quickly
[2:56:46] <%aishman> Go for under the belly to
[2:56:46] <%UrsulaCat> stop calling shots
[2:56:48] <%yeknomlive> that was some ultra instinct shit right there
[2:56:52] <+cstigerwright> Here comes the shield spam
[2:56:56] <BigNerdSam> +50 Whiff King
[2:57:05] <vVAstrAVv> i think this ai might be smart? lol
[2:57:11] <xeros720> i'm reminded of Arino whiffing the final hit in that jankass Ultraman fighting game
[2:57:16] <%TechTurtle7> DEM CORNER TRAPS WILL GITCHA
[2:57:16] <+segatas> Bazooka was so good for this fight
[2:57:19] <+paladinstarbuster> PAPA NIER
[2:57:20] <%aishman> Go for the stomach
[2:57:24] <KeroKamina> 90% we're almost there
[2:57:32] <KeroKamina> also this game needs boss healthbars
[2:57:51] <+cstigerwright> Under belly
[2:57:51] <Finaldragoon> the underbelly
[2:57:52] <+Exyoh> It's all belly once the knees are gone
[2:57:53] <%QueequegTheater> dro your shield
[2:57:56] <%aishman> Also Woolie, there's still a healing tank I think
[2:57:56] <meowmeow7t> Ammmo!
[2:58:01] <+paladinstarbuster> GET THE TUMMY
[2:58:02] <%DashXero> 90% home stretch!
[2:58:11] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus underbelly is hte easiest weakpoint you haven't shot yet
[2:58:13] <%QueequegTheater> MY KNEE
[2:58:13] <+cstigerwright> You can pretty much kill it off rip if you break all underbelly parts first
[2:58:16] <Xeno351> this game doesn't need health bars it's mech monster hunter
[2:58:24] <xtremegamer80> Healing tanks should replenish your ammo, don't ya think?
[2:58:28] <%QueequegTheater> mh ALSO NEEDS HEALTH BARS
[2:58:30] <+gessho> The framerate though
[2:58:32] <+MagickBurritoh> @WoolieVersus no ammo
[2:58:35] <%DashXero> SHut up, Johnny!
[2:58:39] <+Shotgundam009> am I?
[2:59:01] <xeros720> god damn, he keeps doing that shield
[2:59:01] <Xeno351> @QueequegTheater GIT GUD and learn when they're limping
[2:59:03] <%aishman> MISSILES
[2:59:16] <+Tonku_the_Red> Look at that goki uniform star glitter!
[2:59:16] <+MagickBurritoh> Also parts of the mech break and hurt your auto target ability
[2:59:18] <BigNerdSam> Purge the guns, @woolieversus press left or right on the D-pad and hold up
[2:59:23] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus shooting the other enemies drop ammo + all guns have a specific amount of range. also you pickedu p missles
[2:59:44] <%QueequegTheater> @Xeno351 there is literally no reason for such a spreadsheet-focused series to not display monster HP
[2:59:46] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, they are dead
[2:59:50] <%TechTurtle7> punch it with your shields, but dont cuz you cant but should be able to
[2:59:51] <+cstigerwright> Gotta get up in them guts
[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:53] <+Exyoh> You've got missiles
[2:59:58] <+segatas> yeah you never run out of ammo of you kill the grunts
[2:59:59] <%DashXero> You've got missiles!
[3:00:01] <%aishman> You just got missiles dude
[3:00:02] <derekwst3> at least you have shields
[3:00:08] <+MagickBurritoh> funny how that charge does nothing if you're on the ground
[3:00:10] <TheAzureOracle> No you're gun and missies still have ammo
[3:00:13] <thebattiebear> when will new dmc5 vids be up on the youtuber?
[3:00:13] <+fatal_penguin_> Throw some sand in his eyes
[3:00:14] <TheAzureOracle> *your
[3:00:19] <%aishman> Cause they don't have lockon
[3:00:21] <+NemokillerV> You got missiles and 24 rifle rounds
[3:00:26] <KeroKamina> WE WON ANYWAY
[3:00:28] <%aishman> You did iiit
[3:00:29] <+MagickBurritoh> SUCCESS
[3:00:30] <KeroKamina> Yay?
[3:00:30] <TheAzureOracle> YOU DID IT
[3:00:32] <%DashXero> Your head part is destroyed so your reticle area is reduced.
[3:00:32] <+NemokillerV> Aye its dead
[3:00:34] <Sunditsu> That last shot did it LUL
[3:00:36] <Flunkorg> It only took 1 bullet
[3:00:40] <Cata_2136> missles need a lock on
[3:00:42] <+burritocheetos> u have to lockon for missiles
[3:00:42] <%aishman> The missiles need a lock on
[3:00:44] <TheAzureOracle> They have to lock on first
[3:00:47] <Xeno351> @QueequegTheater it's exaclty because it's such a spreadsheet focused game that you need the excitement of never knowing just how close you are to the end.
[3:00:48] <%aishman> You were too far.
[3:00:49] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus You need a lock on to shoot missles.
[3:00:50] <vVAstrAVv> you..........did it
[3:00:50] <%MForan98> They need to lock on yeah
[3:00:51] <+NemokillerV> They need lockon
[3:00:53] <+paladinstarbuster> LOCK ON
[3:00:59] <meowmeow7t> Big lockon
[3:01:00] <Cata_2136> get a heal
[3:01:01] <+MagickBurritoh> @WoolieVersus head part got damaged which hurts autotarget
[3:01:01] <Xeno351> just approximations
[3:01:06] <+Grayhammatter> get on top?
[3:01:06] <+fatal_penguin_> Steal his shoes
[3:01:06] <%king_wragles> So, is this mecha Monster Hunter?
[3:01:06] <BigNerdSam> Youre not argeting anything with the missiles, @woolieversus
[3:01:08] <seylumiue> Need lockons for missiles
[3:01:11] <%QueequegTheater> @Xeno351 No you don't, you need more information
[3:01:14] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus things are only salvagabe in the 2nd and 3rd mission
[3:01:22] <%aishman> There is, look at the minimap
[3:01:24] <Cata_2136> there was one but ok\
[3:01:24] <%QueequegTheater> no but heal tho
[3:01:27] <%Eaglestrike117> Look at the mini map, theres one right behind you
[3:01:27] <%aishman> There's a heal to your left
[3:01:32] <+segatas> green on map is heal
[3:01:32] <%DashXero> You weren't firing missiles because you weren't getting a lock on. You weren't getting a lock on because your reticle area was significantly reduced due to your head part being damaged.
[3:01:38] <%QueequegTheater> oh no
[3:01:41] <+fatal_penguin_> nooo
[3:01:46] <%aishman> Uh oh-OH we're back
[3:01:50] <%QueequegTheater> STRIM IS KILL

[3:01:57] <suddenlyscorched> Oh no
[3:02:01] <s_snowball> MrDestructoid

[3:02:03] <vVAstrAVv> hold on
[3:02:05] <%Eaglestrike117> Seriously
[3:02:15] <+NemokillerV> Stream is ok now
[3:02:16] <Wisconsinite> That’s what happens when you get on top
[3:02:17] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus not sure if we'll ever see it in this stream but when you get a blade weapon, if you and an enemy cross blades you do a sword struggle
[3:02:20] <+cstigerwright> YA DID GUD THOUGH
[3:02:21] <%DashXero> Way to go! That took me several tries.
[3:02:22] <Cata_2136> you did fine
[3:02:25] <%TechTurtle7> stream troubles, its ok now
[3:02:26] <waifoong98> meh, at least you are not playing Last Raven for the first time Kappa
[3:02:29] <+segatas> Who isn't?
[3:02:41] <+Zerodyne90> thicc
[3:02:45] <%CrimsonCore90> you did awesome stop being so hard on yourself
[3:02:52] <%aishman> Naw man, no worries. IT happens
[3:02:52] <+cstigerwright> Pretty sure everyone ran out of ammo thier first time fighting it
[3:02:54] <%aishman> As long as you had fun
[3:02:56] <+segatas> Everyone has different play styles. You fight up close I fight form a distance. Everyone is different
[3:02:57] <%NKOrange> your doing fine
[3:02:57] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[3:02:59] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus Dude you did it without grinding for loot. You did so much better than most people.
[3:03:01] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Pat is too much of a coward to play Spec Ops: The Line. Are you a cool enough dude to play "Nolan North gets PTSD in Real Time: The Game"?
[3:03:02] <%FadingEmber> No one gets better by not failing
[3:03:06] <vVAstrAVv> youre not doing that bad its ok
[3:03:16] <dabirSA> does woolie understand any of the mechanics because I didn't
[3:03:17] <%yeknomlive> is the demo gone?
[3:03:19] <OUTheTeam> This is the woolie drewam
[3:03:29] <+MagickBurritoh> You did good for your first time with girls watching
[3:03:30] <%UrsulaCat> it's okay to not understand
[3:03:31] <+segatas> yeah I grinded for loot and wools didn't so hats off
[3:03:50] <reiju_22> how much content is there? Isn't this just a demo??
[3:03:51] <vVAstrAVv> demos gone for me at least
[3:03:56] <+MagickBurritoh> starfox time
[3:03:56] <+segatas> With a good loot mech the fight became easy
[3:03:59] <%DashXero> Baby-maker still works, though.
[3:04:01] <Doc1790> BCOME A MACHINE
[3:04:02] <+NekoNinja13> is this a new demo?
[3:04:02] <+Arkfyre> reject your humanity
[3:04:02] <%MForan98> Jesus
[3:04:03] <+Grayhammatter> Detroit: Become robot
[3:04:07] <waifoong98> @DashXero LUL
[3:04:08] <Doc1790> LOSE YOUR HUMANITY
[3:04:08] <%aishman> You look cool though
[3:04:08] <Vital_Ire> Yes woolie, limbs are what make people human
[3:04:09] <dabirSA> I would have liked to understand what femto does or what you're supposed to do when you lose your mech and pop out as a human
[3:04:09] <%UrsulaCat> amputee porn
[3:04:10] <%QueequegTheater> MAKE BABBY
[3:04:11] <+cstigerwright> Detriot Become Human but in reverse
[3:04:11] <+Zerodyne90> Woolie: Barely Human
[3:04:11] <SpaceGuntank> HUMAN +
[3:04:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Abandon the flesh
[3:04:16] <SirDogBear> you are already a daemon
[3:04:18] <+MagickBurritoh> doesn't make sense
[3:04:19] <@Solidus_113> organic bodies are for cowards
[3:04:24] <+NemokillerV> @NekoNinja13 No this is the original demo
[3:04:24] <+paladinstarbuster> laser tits incoming
[3:04:33] <vVAstrAVv> detroit become mecha
[3:04:33] <Vital_Ire> remember guys, limbs are what define you as a person
[3:04:36] <%TechTurtle7> this is a pat game reject your mortal coil for cool robo bits
[3:04:37] <%QueequegTheater> praise the Omnissiah
[3:04:40] <Laironx3> How long until you become a head in a robot body
[3:04:51] <%DashXero> "Aim your weapons here!"
[3:04:51] <+segatas> like an RPG you grind to get stronger with loot and skills
[3:04:56] <vVAstrAVv> no brain in a jar lol
[3:04:59] <SirDogBear> at end of game your pilot will be stronger outside of the mecha
[3:05:02] <%QueequegTheater> That's why quadraplegics have no real rights
[3:05:05] <bonzosan> has that armored core difficulty, but a tiny bit easier
[3:05:05] <+MagickBurritoh> how long until you're raiden taking on mechs with a sword
[3:05:11] <reiju_22> is this a pat game?
[3:05:11] <@Solidus_113> it's now midnight
[3:05:11] <+Tonku_the_Red> Yep, just 4 missions.
[3:05:14] <+cstigerwright> Wait if you're a human, but become a robot, does that mean your Ghost In The Shell
[3:05:15] <+Grayhammatter> all in all, pretty nice SeemsGood
[3:05:22] <Doc1790> You can still go back and get more loot
[3:05:23] <MustBeColin> !uptime
[3:05:24] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 5 minutes
[3:05:32] <+MagickBurritoh> you can retry the LASER
[3:05:33] <+segatas> I have 10 hours in the demo lol
[3:05:35] <+burritocheetos> maybe we can do sword next?
[3:05:45] <+Grayhammatter> half an hour my goddamn ass
[3:05:46] <SubjectX07x> @bonzosan That's good, some armored core missions got a lil... goofy.
[3:05:48] <@Solidus_113> No Apex then, Skullgod gets to sleep
[3:05:49] <vVAstrAVv> god if endgame is you trashing mechs out of yours like id thatll be sweet
[3:05:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "half an hour" LUL
[3:05:53] <Cata_2136> so how do you feel about the game woolie?
[3:05:55] <+Tonku_the_Red> Wollie and his "Not the Face" loadout. . .
[3:06:01] <+MagickBurritoh> !uptime
[3:06:01] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 6 minutes
[3:06:01] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus since we didn't see it in this stream, if you get a sword weapon and you and the enemy mech cross swords you have a sword struggle button mashing sequence
[3:06:03] <%QueequegTheater> cheer500 Pat is too much of a coward to play Spec Ops: The Line. Are you a cool enough dude to play "Nolan North gets PTSD in Real Time: The Game"?
[3:06:24] <Cata_2136> for me it didnt scratch my speedy mechs itch, felt really clunky to me
[3:06:26] <xtremegamer80> I hope that we get co-op
[3:06:33] <xtremegamer80> REALLY?
[3:06:41] <+dtogo> yup
[3:06:44] <+burritocheetos> there is Co-op and PVP planned at relaese
[3:06:45] <Xeno351> i think they already confirmed co op
[3:06:48] <+Johnny_Treehouse> Johnny_Treehouse subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:06:48] <KeroKamina> @xtremegamer80 yep
[3:06:55] <xtremegamer80> THAT'S SO COOL
[3:06:59] <+KingOfTheGeats> KingOfTheGeats subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:07:07] <xtremegamer80> I take back what I said about sword
[3:07:08] <%DashXero> Co-op is gonna be fun!
[3:07:18] <%RioGascar> Hows the performance on the switch?
[3:07:20] <%yeknomlive> man i cant wait
[3:07:25] <OUTheTeam> Noice
[3:07:29] <%QueequegTheater> "I'm not a fan" -Woolie
[3:07:29] <+segatas> I love to grind for loot
[3:07:34] <%yeknomlive> woolie get an mk11 invite?
[3:07:44] <%MForan98> @WoolieVersus some people also pretty intuitive with games, I managed to get consistent A ranks back with the OG DMC 3 release (with the goofy difficultly lies) and Armored Core
[3:07:49] <%MForan98> and yeah
[3:07:56] <%DashXero> They'll probably let you buy equipment.
[3:07:57] <+segatas> You will have up to 4 mechs
[3:07:58] <brows_> How does Duo Breaker Rev Impact sound as a signature move for Woolie's mech?
[3:08:11] <%DashXero> They'd better let you buy equipment.
[3:08:15] <%aishman> Yeah I think the full game will let you just let you buy parts
[3:08:17] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie that "thing inside you" you don't have is called a genetic predisposition for addictive personality
[3:08:17] <+segatas> and many weapons to decorate your hangar
[3:08:26] <%MForan98> This feels like it's a Mech Shlooter with an AC Skin
[3:08:27] <%QueequegTheater> Like Pat does
[3:08:29] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus isnt that also somewhat DMC? Replaying a mission over and over to get the one thing everyone wants to see? (Ex taunts)
[3:08:51] <%TechTurtle7> it needs a proper lock on, needs increased movement speed, and better character/Arsenal creation/customization
[3:08:52] <+CptnCampy61> Is this switch exclusive?
[3:08:54] <+segatas> Yeah DMC5 played a bunch to get those rorbs
[3:08:57] <@Menitta> You think you'll ever stream Gundam Breaker 3? That'd be a good stream like this one
[3:09:00] <xeros720> must dislike rng, money is is always guaranteed in these games
[3:09:08] <+segatas> @CptnCampy61 Nintendo owned IP now so yes
[3:09:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:09:10] <Cata_2136> @WoolieVersus i think some of the old armored cores had it so that you unlocked parts in the store after beating pilots in one on one mech fights
[3:09:19] <%MForan98> That said, the skin is pretty, and the game feels good, but looting might be important for actual good gear which might be hard for some to enjoy

[3:10:20] <MustBeColin> runs down the hall with my arms flailing
[3:10:32] <+khalcipher> what
[3:10:33] <Finakala> Spec Ops was a fine game
[3:10:39] <Morning_Asakura> yall mind if i get !motivated
[3:10:40] <@Solidus_113> it was alright
[3:10:44] <@Menitta> I wanna play that gamew
[3:10:45] <%QueequegTheater> Fair warning: It gets REAL
[3:10:48] <+C0L0NEL_CUDDLES> This game is pretty fun, but i really just want a new Armored Core
[3:10:48] <+blastazoid26> @woolieversus Is the green screen coming back to the channel anytime soon?
[3:10:51] <dragoon001914> NICE
[3:10:52] <Plague_Nurse> It's a game you only play once
[3:10:53] <Finakala> Well, the gameplay is super averaegh
[3:10:53] <%QueequegTheater> PogCham
[3:10:53] <DatAsuna> It's a fine B game that is ragged down by some very contrived moments
[3:10:56] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus thanks for playing PGs best game W101 and one day let's see Bayo! Thanks!
[3:10:57] <%QueequegTheater> PogChamp
[3:10:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> But is it as perfect as The Guy Game?
[3:10:58] <+khalcipher> Nice keep it up
[3:11:07] <DatAsuna> The worst thing you can do is go in with hype
[3:11:09] <Morning_Asakura> ye
[3:11:09] <SubjectX07x> Aww hell yeah that's the best part
[3:11:11] <SpaceGuntank> oh man it gets real, like real real. none of that proxy stuff.
[3:11:12] <%UrsulaCat> woofie is sick
[3:11:13] <NumberTooBig> good luck with the bad cover shooting and knowing the twist through osmosis
[3:11:16] <+Intolerable> KWEE-KWEGG
[3:11:23] <Morning_Asakura> go in as cold as possible
[3:11:25] <DatAsuna> You wanna play spec ops with no expectations for it to have impact.
[3:11:28] <MustBeColin> impactzoneSTEINER
[3:11:33] <DatAsuna> Otherwise you get undertale effect'd
[3:11:35] <ZeroCount> @WoolieVersus I know you like Punch girls, but what about kick girls?
[3:11:35] <%QueequegTheater> NO
[3:11:36] <Plague_Nurse> That's overselling it
[3:11:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I don't believe THAT
[3:11:39] <@Solidus_113> don't go in expecting feels though
[3:11:40] <%QueequegTheater> IT'S SO NOT
[3:11:47] <@Solidus_113> don't build anything up
[3:11:50] <%MForan98> @WoolieVersus yeah, it was marketed as one, but it's not
[3:11:51] <Finakala> It's a generic third person shooter gameplay wise
[3:11:52] <zamzoph> it's not even first person
[3:11:53] <Xeno351> the story is pretty average tbh
[3:11:53] <SpaceGuntank> "crazy shit" is putting it lightly
[3:11:55] <DatAsuna> Overhype will kill spec ops
[3:11:56] <noobpsyboticus> @woolieversus hey did you ever discover that void mode has full on fighting game style practice settings for enemy ai, damage, and meter recharge?
[3:11:58] <+MagickBurritoh> approach it as generic shooter
[3:12:04] <+paladinstarbuster> DONT SPOIL HIM
[3:12:08] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's Nolan North's single best performance IMO, it's worth it for that alone
[3:12:11] <%MForan98> So a lot of people got the Bait and Switch for what they thought was a basic FPS
[3:12:12] <%TechTurtle7> careful with overhype
[3:12:15] <Morning_Asakura> i love spec ops but dont let the hype kill iy
[3:12:20] <@Menitta> Its on Xbox Backwards Compatibility so hey
[3:12:23] <@Menitta> OH THATS THE BEST
[3:12:24] <SubjectX07x> I believe it was intentionally marketted as a generic shooter but it does go places.
[3:12:24] <+SuzakuRising> I wouldn't say Spec Ops The Line is THAT high in the feels. MGS3 is significantly higher than it.
[3:12:27] <CrmznOgre> WAIT WHAT!?!
[3:12:29] <@Menitta> YES
[3:12:29] <SpaceGuntank> ITS SO BAD
[3:12:31] <xtremegamer80> Oh nooooooooo
[3:12:32] <+cvp5127> ewww
[3:12:34] <Naho_Saenoki> YEAH
[3:12:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Do it

[3:13:29] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus Nothing will ever be worse than the german opening to Naruto
[3:13:29] <Superbro64> DREAMIN
[3:13:31] <@Solidus_113> YOU CAN MAKE AN UNBREAKABLE BOND
[3:13:38] <+MagickBurritoh> HOLY SHIT ITS BAD
[3:13:40] <CrmznOgre> hell the rave master op is pretty nice
[3:13:42] <SubjectX07x> Gotta gotta gooo YO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:13:43] <mr_miyagichu> Kirby right back at ya has a better English op than jp op
[3:13:45] <xeros720> i always liked the american intro to Fist of the North Star, it fits pretty well even though it isn't You Wa Shock
[3:13:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I like the Screemo Naruto song
[3:13:48] <NumberTooBig> luffy luffy, luffy luffy, luffy ball Z
[3:13:49] <zamzoph> shut up I like the original Escaflowne OP tho. It's a fucking romance anime anyway
[3:13:59] <SpaceGuntank> reel big fish did the opening to rave master and i'll love them forever for that
[3:14:01] <Superbro64> DONT GIVE IT UP NAMI
[3:14:03] <%aishman> Man, I wish we got a new Escaflowne
[3:14:04] <@Solidus_113> Shaman King is the absolute top of the list best 4kids OP
[3:14:04] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit... oh my god, it's so bad
[3:14:06] <CopperTucker> to be fair the Cardcaptor dub is bad, but that theme song is fantastic
[3:14:07] <%aishman> That shit was the best
[3:14:08] <+NekoNinja13> Escaflowne original op is SOOOO good!
[3:14:10] <CrmznOgre> AND A CARROT NOSE DOG!
[3:14:17] <+MagickBurritoh> DONT EAT A RICEBALL EAT A DONUT
[3:14:20] <OUTheTeam> Digimon best english opening
[3:14:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yugioh was dope
[3:14:26] <%QueequegTheater> Cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable feeling caused by holding two conflicting ideas simultaneously.
[3:14:29] <$KnivesEve> reminds me of the opening of xc1
[3:14:37] <+segatas> @WoolieVersus You ever play Xenoblade? Robots the size of Japan clang swords
[3:14:43] <Finakala> Escaflowne has mechs with invisibility capes, that's all you really need to say
[3:14:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yugioh GX was my literal young years
[3:14:46] <+khalcipher> like the ship in pacific rim
[3:14:55] <xtremegamer80> Woolie stop, my schlong can't handle it.
[3:14:56] <%TechTurtle7> Well that was a thing I spent my time on
[3:15:00] <+alphonseisbest> PLAY XENOBLADE 1!!!!
[3:15:06] <KeroKamina> pls watch the opening liveo n stream
[3:15:08] <xtremegamer80> I can only get so erect
[3:15:11] <+segatas> opening of Xenoblade is mecha the size of a country clanging swords
[3:15:11] <Deadpool2450> Real talk 4kids Yu-Gi-Oh card monsters intro beats the jp opening by a mile longshot
[3:15:14] <+NekoNinja13> Yu-GI-Oh 5ds had a great american op
[3:15:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Xenoblade's the shit
[3:15:17] <KeroKamina> also yes play xenoblade 1
[3:15:18] <vVAstrAVv> their country is responsible for the ho lo graphic map lol
[3:15:23] <%DashXero> I like how your mech in DxM is only two stories tall.
[3:15:29] <+MagickBurritoh> It would take insane power to start and stop really fast in a million ton thing
[3:15:30] <%UrsulaCat> slippery jehuty
[3:15:36] <+cstigerwright> If you like Jehuty style you'll like the Eureka Seven Openings
[3:15:37] <+blastazoid26> PLAY XENOBLADE 1
[3:15:37] <+NekoNinja13> Patlabor has great weight to its mechs too
[3:15:38] <$FuqBoiSlim> last train is so good thougu
[3:15:38] <+khalcipher> Like the mech in Pacific rim they are so heavy feeling @WoolieVersus
[3:15:40] <Graxe_> Kirby will make things okay.
[3:15:40] <MelBrooksKA> My audio and video are super out of sync and this conversation is really trippy

[3:50:06] <%neooneshin> I knew I wasn't crazy
[3:50:08] <Kaitepaints> For KOTOR 2
[3:50:10] <PaulToon1990> You should! Though need to do the PC version, Restored Content Mod.
[3:50:23] <+blademaster247> Yeah, Pat is clearly the only person you know who cares about KOTOR 2
[3:50:33] <DatAsuna> More Pazaak
[3:50:38] <hntronium> PART 100 THO
[3:50:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> what if i never played the game
[3:50:42] <Edtango> But why are you uploading this and not KOTOR 2 more often?
[3:50:42] <+Flambage> Bribe him with redbull
[3:50:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You put up the entire LP
[3:50:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, not more pazaak
[3:50:49] <hntronium> ONE HUNDRED PARTS
[3:50:51] <Kaitepaints> I watched it allllll
[3:50:58] <+MagickBurritoh> Say its true name, PAZAAK 2
[3:50:59] <DatAsuna> They also asked about third birthday. lol
[3:51:00] <%linkwolf4> (kowashitai echoes in the distance)
[3:51:01] <PaulToon1990> I loved the KOTOR playthrough with you and pat.
[3:51:02] <xeros720> you don't need to beat it, just play pazak for 10 episodes
[3:51:02] <%QueequegTheater> Put up the entire LP as a 50 hour video
[3:51:04] <hntronium> I loved all your bullshit talks
[3:51:06] <%Zombino924> WHAT IS THAT NOISE
[3:51:11] <%DonatelloJose> That Kotor playthrough was amazing
[3:51:12] <PaulToon1990> All 1 million episodes!
[3:51:23] <IminyourBase> make it episodic
[3:51:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:51:38] <randomness_yo> @WoolieVersus You tried out that MK11 beta yet?
[3:51:50] <%TechTurtle7> RPG without the filler
[3:51:54] <withguac> I would still recommend doing it with pat. The lore and background would help
[3:51:59] <%QueequegTheater> Stream it and upload highlights maybe?
[3:52:00] <%DashXero> Maybe those would be good targets for binge content?
[3:52:01] <xeros720> there's probably only a handful that have no filler
[3:52:03] <vVAstrAVv> cant you just new game plus an rpg?
[3:52:05] <+blademaster247> KOTOR is probably a stream game versus a 100 part lp
[3:52:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Just release an edited format and the uncut version at the same time
