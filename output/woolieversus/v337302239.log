[0:20:46] <MrBorisMakarov> It's fine
[0:20:47] <Flare3500> Woolie said you suck Billy
[0:20:48] <yuribo26> @SoushinSen he called you a fake naruto fan
[0:20:50] <TLPenn> Love this stream so far, Woolie; way better for background listening than Paige of Pat, especially live.
[0:20:50] <amiavamp> Imagine how impossible this would be to watch on Niconico
[0:20:51] <Oxnagadaba> @robertwlewis really??? thx for the info my guy
[0:20:53] <SteeScribbles> Billiam has entered the chat
[0:20:55] <+DatLatinoGuy> you can't beat Billy
[0:20:58] <prime_name> It's like Digimon World.
[0:21:01] <+DatLatinoGuy> Billy too stronk
[0:21:01] <gnarly_memes_bro> @SoushinSen woolie assumed you were ashamed of his play
[0:21:02] <FatDragonQuest> Oh hey woolie! tieZilla
[0:21:02] <kvnmck94> OH SHIT, billy! here to be "fucking good"
[0:21:03] <SuperSaiyanSora> Agreed Woolie

[0:21:05] <PeachSaliva> @tlpenn Wow, thanks a lot
[0:21:06] <+superorangerobin> The Miz had someone tell him he can't improve on a classic and he just pointed to the stands

[0:23:36] <+superorangerobin> Exactly
[0:23:42] <amiavamp> @CertainlySyrix Not weird at all, especially since Spore also had music synced to actions
[0:23:44] <Solidus0101> There's a setting to make the blocks their original colors if that helps
[0:23:48] <+Clik404> my eyes are exploding
[0:23:49] <+robertwlewis> but we can see it so it is fine :)

[1:18:39] <+Zubaz> Chie & Makoto are best girls.
[1:18:40] <Worldbrand> depends on where you live, which is why it;d be smarter to just google it
[1:18:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> P4 girls are trash. Change my mind
[1:18:41] <DickRhino> I feel all hot and bothered after that
[1:18:41] <grenadier42> What I've learned from this stream is that Woolie loves boiling frogs alive.
[1:18:43] <koidev> I heard it woolie! I heard the butthole pucker!
[1:18:43] <DeepFryedLogic> boiled to alive
[1:18:44] <Emdhad> BOI THATS A BUY FROM ME
[1:18:46] <prime_name> You want to kill Frogs?
[1:18:48] <Nikbottom> and frogs never leave cold pots

[1:18:50] <+khalcipher> No roast from me sorry
[1:18:50] <Fkain23> velveleen dream is the experience
[1:18:53] <+waterbuddy16> fun fact in that experiment they actually removed the brains of the frog
[1:18:54] <kvnmck94> "dont lightspeed drop an L-block up my ass"
[1:18:56] <mistermastergreg> woo
[1:18:57] <+Dhrall> The frog in that was lobotomized before the experiment

[1:19:05] <Triggerhappy938> Please support the official release
[1:19:08] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Universal appeal
[1:19:12] <+Menitta> I showed it to my mom. Her initial reaction was "It's distracting"
[1:19:12] <AlertDOTEXE> I would if it was on PC
[1:19:16] <Flare3500> I have a feeling it'll come to PC , they ported REZ to PC so theyll probably port this one too
[1:19:16] <T_Sasquatch> 40 bucks for tetris tho
[1:19:17] <Luvinsus> Really hoping for a PC port for this one
[1:19:17] <Nikbottom> sponcered stream?
[1:19:20] <Sedrelic> my mom prob cant handle this
[1:19:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> But is this on mobile? I have a phone, don't I
[1:19:21] <kvnmck94> is it PS4 only?
[1:19:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> SHOW>IT>TO>YOUR>MOM
[1:19:21] <+PeaceCentennial> This game visually is crazy
[1:19:29] <yuribo26> @T_Sasquatch you mean 40 bucks for digital drugs
[1:19:29] <laserbeaming> He wishes it was sponsored
[1:19:30] <dmysta3000> I'm seriously deciding between this, Spyro, and Pkmn: LGPE
[1:19:31] <+superorangerobin> I showed my dad the demo and he was like "Alright how much does this cost, we're getting it."
[1:19:31] <DickRhino> will do
[1:19:31] <grenadier42> Or just make TGM4
[1:19:31] <FatDragonQuest> when's the paul ws anderson tetris movie
[1:19:34] <N1netbattler> should i follow tetris effect one twitch?
[1:19:35] <+superorangerobin> Like immediately
[1:19:37] <Dean_Inbetween> I would if it came out on switch and had multiplayer
[1:19:40] <itsya_boi_gappy> ill try woolie
[1:19:40] <gustavozxd> I'm gonna show this to everyone, especially if uninterested
[1:19:42] <yuribo26> @Nikbottom tetris sponsored Woolies life
[1:19:44] <+konekoryugamine> I sent my dad a clip of this
[1:19:47] <the_hidden_yeti> ah yes, the tetris franchise
[1:19:51] <+mik255> i see hes taken a lot of ques from max
[1:19:53] <+khalcipher> not kids nowdays tho
[1:19:54] <Jaller101514> also vote for it being best VR game of the year
[1:19:56] <Nikbottom> What if Lumines was a tetris?
[1:19:58] <Dean_Inbetween> because tetris as an absolute package i feel should be portable
[1:20:00] <Sayie> I've never actually played tetris in my 24 years of life
[1:20:02] <Worldbrand> I mean as much as I love TGM, where the fuck am I going to find a cabinet?
[1:20:08] <+waterbuddy16> tetris effect actually does happen
[1:20:08] <+mik255> so blu mage
[1:20:09] <majestic_seven> My parents were shook when I showed them this game
[1:20:11] <kvnmck94> that soumds like some tetris fart sniffin shit
[1:20:16] <+PeaceCentennial> Woolie is going big

[1:21:44] <+superorangerobin> The craziest thing about the Tetris Effect is that people with anteirograde amnesia experience it.
[1:21:45] <grenadier42> I still think TGM3 has a better soundtrack tbh
[1:21:48] <umbypokochan> Tetris should only be between a man and a woman
[1:21:49] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You need to correct Koichi's inside out sock. You. Need. To.

[1:49:51] <Nikbottom> Tetris is not sexy enough for even Zone
[1:49:52] <Applecannon63> Zone tan is focusing on porn
[1:49:52] <HonestHero> Is white girl music another way of saying Country music? SeemsGood
[1:49:54] <captainthunderwolf> Honestly, I'm really glad that Woolie is streaming now. The feedback in viewer overlap between him, Pat, Plague, Peach, Matt's and Liam's streams should be good for all of them.
[1:49:55] <DarkSurplex> Why are these aesthetics so good

[3:31:48] <+lozscat> i was a baby 18 years ago tho
[3:31:49] <+AtomicVR> i tried Rez on the Vive on your recommendation and couldn't really get into it. Gameplay seemed really unengaging. I dunno what I missed.

[3:34:12] <OrochiSheewa> oh god my motion sickness
[3:34:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> If only Woolie had a greenscreen. The gif potential

[3:34:38] <mandragoraroot> makes sense @jobbedbone
[3:34:40] <DigbyMayor> What is even happening
[3:34:43] <odd_slater> @Dovahthing It's a cross between a shoot em up and rhythm game
[3:34:51] <+mechslayer71> What is this LUL
[3:34:52] <+demonsamura> oh didn't think it worked by lights
[3:34:58] <Skullgod> let woolie stream what he wants
[3:35:01] <dukenux> this would give me a seizure so hard
[3:35:03] <+Toynota10> To those unaware, the Best Friends had a PSVR live stream and Woolie's reaction to Rez in VR is fucking priceless
[3:35:10] <+punpunshogun> Nero seems into it
[3:35:10] <+roxikat> He switched to Rez Infinite VR
[3:35:13] <Flare3500> Those gifs really needs to be fixed like put it on the lower left and make it smaller
[3:35:16] <Ayru_> woolie being wholesome is perfect stream material
[3:35:18] <321Continue> @demonsamura almost rvery other vr headset doesnt, but the psvr does
[3:35:21] <yuribo26> @Toynota10 he killed half the stream with his head banging

[3:36:28] <+Toynota10> I'll always support them =D
[3:36:34] <+mechslayer71> @demonsamura ARE WE REALLY GONNA PRETEND THAT PEOPLE DONT KNOW ABOUT DMC?!?!
[3:36:36] <yuribo26> @blacksoap65 as the song suggests, fear is the mind killer
[3:36:39] <ultimatetotoro> weird question; anyone now if this is going on woolies channel later? i won't be able to watch this live
[3:36:39] <+demonsamura> im 26 and have never heard of this game xD
[3:36:45] <+roxikat> Fear Is The Mind Killer
[3:36:49] <blacksoap65> thanks!
[3:36:54] <IceySpy> I've heard people talk about it but never really looked into it
[3:36:55] <+Toynota10> @ultimatetotoro I'm sure he'll upload it there
[3:37:00] <odd_slater> LUL
[3:37:05] <Flare3500> Woolie breaks neck live on first stream
[3:37:08] <+NWR_James> @ultimatetotoro it will be in the twich archive regardless, at least for a bit
[3:37:16] <+Story_Ark> man Tetris effect sure is lacking Tetris
[3:37:16] <yuribo26> @ultimatetotoro I don't know, and if I recall non-partnered vods get deleted after couple weeks
[3:37:17] <juicedmeerkats> This game looks super cool, but I'm also about to vomit
[3:37:18] <+lozscat> I was 14 months when this came out and it still looks great today
[3:37:21] <+demonsamura> ive heard of dmc not the game hes playing though
[3:37:25] <+mechslayer71> @flare3500 It’s a good way to go out, compared to the others
[3:37:26] <kaine_west> I remember watching a review of this game on the local Video game review TV show. Always thought it was sick
[3:37:43] <T_Sasquatch> i still dont know what im looking at
[3:37:43] <King_Doorman> this reminds me of Amplitude on PS2 in a way.
[3:37:48] <mandragoraroot> the baby vineBab ?
[3:37:51] <RunningNGunning> Oh that sample is from California Soul, thats where I recognize it LUL
[3:37:55] <ultimatetotoro> i thought the woolies old stuff was sub locked like the podcast?
[3:37:57] <yuribo26> I love how everytime Woolie pops rez with vr people start to vomit
[3:37:59] <+Toynota10> Wish there were clubs that just played video game music
[3:38:16] <+Menitta> The sounds remind me of that virtual world in Shadow the Hedgehog.
[3:38:17] <modmanawesome69> oh i just realized what game this was and also just realized that i've never seen gameplay of it
[3:38:19] <Flare3500> Just break your neck woolie , what's the deal
[3:38:20] <yuribo26> @ultimatetotoro this is the first stream of this channel
[3:38:22] <+runethomas> hey woolz!
[3:38:28] <Skullgod> woolies stuff cant be sub locked if people cant sub
[3:38:30] <solarenverse> mind is the fear killer
[3:38:30] <+demonsamura> i hate that the podcast is sub locked >.<
[3:38:30] <+mechslayer71> @demonsamura The joke is that woolie constantly does this thing where he assumes people know about his niche obscure shit. The DMC play through is just one such example
[3:38:30] <kaine_west> clubs are mostly wack and play some dumbass dubstep where i'm from
[3:38:32] <+Keyd00d> t-t-the mind K I L L E R
[3:38:33] <Skullgod> :thinking:
[3:38:39] <IceySpy> I feel like I may have seen this on G4 TV when that was a thing
[3:38:41] <ultimatetotoro> ooooh.
[3:38:44] <Sr901> I would like to be sold on this game but I cant understand what I'm viewing
[3:38:48] <Dovahthing> when did this come out?
[3:38:51] <A_d3adly_zambo> so woolie do like kirby ? nod for answer
[3:38:57] <solarenverse> this was on dreamcast
[3:38:57] <+lozscat> nod
[3:38:58] <+demonsamura> oh, im behind on my woolie lore
[3:39:01] <yuribo26> @Dovahthing dreamcast
[3:39:15] <ultimatetotoro> ooooh...okay. thanks guys!
[3:39:18] <juicedmeerkats> The flying lotus position is rad
[3:39:21] <yuribo26> @Sr901 its like a shmup on rails mixed with rhytmn game
[3:39:27] <+Menitta> You mean like when Kevin Spacey says "Hey a PS Vita! I should get one for the car"
[3:39:27] <+PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Well if there was more like it wouldnt stand out as much
[3:39:33] <+captain_history> this is a known game, it's not super popular what it's known
[3:39:37] <+lozscat> Hey how long is rez anyways?
[3:39:41] <buffmurffy> wireframes are awesome and do not get nearly enough play nowadays
[3:39:48] <C_game_me_811> @dovahthing Originally on the PS 2
[3:39:53] <+Keyd00d> like 2 hours max
[3:39:54] <reonome> PUKE CITY
[3:39:56] <+bluetocho13> @demonsamura more lore will get added quicker now that woolie is streaming
[3:39:59] <+roxikat> If only TRON Legacy had performed.
[3:40:01] <solarenverse> @C_game_me_811 dreamcast, not ps2
[3:40:01] <jobbedbone> what does failure look like in this game?
[3:40:11] <jobbedbone> is he doing well?
[3:40:17] <+astropyrus> The Extended Best Friends Universe grows stronger and stronger with every stream
[3:40:19] <+mechslayer71> @jobbedbone It looks like a failure of game design Kappa
[3:40:30] <yuribo26> @jobbedbone aiming with the vr set makes the game super easy
[3:40:33] <+demonsamura> isn't this just asura's wrath?
[3:40:54] <Pnutz409> Is this Lawnmower Man 3?
[3:40:54] <+bluetocho13> but will lessen since Matt wont be streaming that often anymore
[3:40:58] <dukenux> THis is the most video game video game ive seen in a while
[3:40:58] <Mysf1t> What game is this? The stream still says Tetris.
[3:41:03] <reonome> rez

[3:41:05] <Skullgod> Rez
[3:41:07] <+jjgamez64> @jobbedbone Failure looks like not as much poppin' beats and the player becomes a simple sphere

[3:41:23] <Cosairen> rez: woolie makes his stream vomit edition

[3:41:31] <solarenverse> @C_game_me_811 actually my bad, dc and ps2 were same day
[3:41:35] <IceySpy> Yeah, this definitely gives the impression of an obscure Dreamcast game
[3:41:40] <+demonsamura> woolies neck is going to be destoryed after this
[3:41:41] <+JoeStillLife> LUL
[3:41:43] <Flare3500> I like how the number of people watching is going down/maybe dying thanks to woolie
[3:41:46] <Pnutz409> ugh sorry gotta go. this is too much.
[3:41:47] <+mechslayer71> I really don’t se show this makes people vomit. Is motion sickness that real? LUL
[3:41:52] <wolfofsound> I only know of it thanks to woolie constantly talking about it
[3:41:56] <frozenwaifu> how have i never seen this game before now
[3:41:57] <Skullgod> i think this is fine
[3:42:04] <+astropyrus> people get real motion sick real quick with vr, especially if youre not in it
[3:42:09] <dukenux> Eh, its getting late for me
[3:42:10] <yuribo26> @wolfofsound same
[3:42:15] <+lozscat> hey you just become a ball its maybe not that deep

[3:43:08] <+mechslayer71> @demonsamura Same. It def doesn’t look good, but it’s not that bad
[3:43:08] <+runethomas> i haven't touched my psvr since re7 honestly
[3:43:09] <Dovahthing> It's kinda surreal to see a game from 17 years ago look like an indie darling that could be dropped on steam tomorrow and blow people away... is this the dont let it set in pat warns about
[3:43:16] <+punpunshogun> @buffmurffy If Spacechannel 5 could get a VR Game, then NIGHTS better get one.
