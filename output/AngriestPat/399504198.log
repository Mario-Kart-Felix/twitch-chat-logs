Just so you know I've never played, or even been vaguely interested in, the DMC series until you/you and Woolie played 5 and I thought it looked dope and bought it, so thanks for getting me into it!

Its my fault ultimately but Im sad Im out of the military for the time being. Anyways, Its good to have internet access back , I hope I didnt miss much.
[0:13:42] <%Tarcanist_> or redbull like pat @elenamanetta
[0:13:50] <+Eclipse_knight_> theres no health risk in drinking spoiled milk

[0:14:13] <+TheoTTree> I feel that
[0:14:16] <+Ell1ot> Hi, Pat!
[0:14:17] <+TheoTTree> IT SO DOES
[0:14:20] <moobphysics> If you can eat cottage cheese you can drink day old warm milk
[0:14:20] <%GohanEgret> @Eclipse_knight_ in fact, it makes you twice as strong and invincible to damage

[0:14:25] <%Ascethetic> in a good way
[0:14:26] <AquilaHarukaze> I think the fact you have no way of getting your stuff back is REALLY gutting.
[0:14:26] <%Afterman_> this game feels more like an action tenchu than any souls game
[0:14:26] <eco419> Yup
[0:14:27] <%UncannyMatt> The Ninja Gaiden of Dark Souls
[0:14:27] <theotherguy617> Which makes sense
[0:14:30] <T_sarr> your name is false advertisement

[0:14:41] <%Rellim80> Just stop rushing
[0:14:42] <%Kduff89> Hey dudes apatDab
[0:14:42] <AquilaHarukaze> As opposed to at least having a chance of getting your souls back
[0:14:53] <JeremyThunderStrikes> a Ninja Gaiden by From Soft would be Sick though
[0:14:55] <abakkus> damn my phone only *just* pushed the twitch notif, how long has this been live?
[0:14:56] <%GohanEgret> apatDab
[0:14:59] <%discouragedoblong> Honestly I find it's both the hardest and easiest souls games, enemies are really hard but you have so many options on how to deal with them and escape
[0:15:03] <EnlightenedKramer> @angriestpat If you where do you stand on the Flats vs Drumsticks debate?

[0:16:46] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I feel like how fast you progress in this game depends on how long you can keep up your peak performance level before you burn yourself out focusing mentally every single battle

I am not annoyed, really I ain't. I kid though, you all made me want to play it on my channel, I really appreciate you introducing me to how not really hard the Souls series is, just a different, stricter ruleset!

[0:27:13] <$megamonmon123> @kefbar dont think so

[0:47:17] <Rhide1> @AngriestPat Did you buy the skill scroll from the carp guy? I heard it has decent move in it, 5 scales cost tho
[0:47:21] <Kaitepaints> I feel like those assassins from the umbrella academy
[0:47:22] <deviljhojho94> clever

[0:48:32] <%Deekman> Paige does the same thing
[0:48:33] <%connos_livereview> no steppy
[0:48:39] <Thalchampz> the mask seems like a crst of artorias thing
[0:48:44] <$Brother_Coduss> @stabbityrabbit wait theres a bloodborn 2?
[0:48:49] <%Remery_> "You're going to thrust me with that weaon? Let me lift my leg up"
[0:48:56] <%joylent_blue> if there does end up being a BB 2, i wouldn't mind it being pure action like this
[0:48:56] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> mash it
[0:48:57] <%Kisabuza> Hey Pat
[0:49:01] <$megamonmon123> is that an x cut?
[0:49:03] <%trnzero> COOL

[0:49:20] <+RC_S3kshun8> This is the new fromsoft game right?
[0:49:24] <Finakala> Yup
[0:49:25] <%joylent_blue> yea
[0:49:30] <Picia000123> Is it in glorious English? GachiGasm
[0:49:32] <stabbityrabbit> @Brother_Coduss Not yet, but Playstation and Fromsoft are both extremely fond of the series. So it seems like a shoe-in to come back.
[0:49:32] <Marpolo13> rad
[0:49:33] <FirewallStorm> that's like a boss moveset
[0:49:34] <gustavozxd> there's no bb2 official confirmation but considering how many people want that game I imagine it'll happen eventually
[0:49:35] <%Kisabuza> Is it worth comparing this game and Nioh?
[0:49:36] <$Micome> I hope this game has an equivalent to bloodborne secretly having aliens
[0:49:36] <$megamonmon123> so is the best equipment in this game a headband?
[0:49:41] <+RC_S3kshun8> Nice! How is it so far? @AngriestPat
[0:49:46] <%joylent_blue> her old soul is full of bitch
[0:49:57] <%discouragedoblong> Did he find the hidden room before the butterfly boss btw?
[0:50:00] <VRNK> shinobi vs shinobi
[0:50:01] <%trnzero> Will some of the big bosses be his MENTORS
[0:50:03] <alcors_wisdom> when i left you i was but the student now i return to you the master
[0:50:18] <Finakala> The Owls are not what they seem
[0:50:31] <%Jpdodds> its YOUR fault,m stop dying
[0:50:34] <+ChooseYourOwnLoLs> is this game any good?
[0:50:36] <%joylent_blue> yeah i do look forward to the Miyazaki twist
[0:50:41] <%Deekman> USE NEW TECHNIQUE
[0:50:41] <%Konquerer> that's not as cool as ALIENS
[0:50:42] <%discouragedoblong> Don't trust anything that can turn it's head 360 degrees
[0:50:48] <%trnzero> He says that to Paige quite often
[0:50:49] <MagknO> Where's Sekiro is actually just Japanese agent Cooper
[0:50:50] <StromkoPenguin> Don't trust owls. They'll swoop down and take the teeth straight out of your head. BibleThump
[0:50:52] <Marpolo13> wouldn't be surprised . the good guys are usually not who they seem in these types of stories
[0:50:58] <rosemon5001> we should kill all the kids they might be albhed ehh ehhh
[0:51:00] <%connos_livereview> becuase as we all know pat is very fast
[0:51:01] <defectivefire718> pat how mid maxed are you right now?
[0:51:03] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Palpatine was behind it all! apatSmug
[0:51:11] <%Jpdodds> @ChooseYourOwnLoLs No, its terrible and we hate it, thats why we are talking enthusiastically about it
[0:51:15] <%joylent_blue> how do you min-max when there are no stats
[0:51:16] <%Jpdodds> i kid
[0:51:17] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the item you get from butterfly is the result of someone denying the dragonblood oath, which means she refused resurrection ability
[0:51:23] <leviathan666303> what if dragon rot is the pale blood from bloodborne @AngriestPat
[0:51:24] <%Ion_LaserX> apatDab
[0:51:25] <defectivefire718> is there no stats?
[0:51:29] <%joylent_blue> nope, pure action
[0:51:30] <Prevot> obatarian
[0:51:31] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Don't trust anyone who can look at you even when you're behind them
[0:51:34] <%discouragedoblong> @AngriestPat did you find the hidden room before the butterfly boss already?
[0:51:36] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat is it easy to level up in this?
[0:51:38] <defectivefire718> interesting
[0:51:48] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I sucked at this and now everyone is sick should I restart?
[0:51:57] <%PlainSimpleTailor> And this area is perpetually burning
[0:52:11] <defectivefire718> i only knew this was a souls like so i figured it had stats
[0:52:14] <%Gogogolem> wait whats the phantom thing?
[0:52:15] <+pabloelenano2> or you are in a ilusion
[0:52:21] <garbageheaphound> now the one armed guy?
[0:52:22] <%discouragedoblong> Well I hope he found it
[0:52:24] <+Wintermute_VRC> told you she was easy
[0:52:24] <%joylent_blue> i'm glad they took out the RPG elements
[0:52:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @defectivefire718 It's not a souls like.
[0:52:25] <alcors_wisdom> @PlainSimpleTailor well thats because its like a memory or something
[0:52:26] <+Austinck> is that crazy talk at it again
[0:52:28] <Vikken141> Fight purple man
[0:52:35] <$Mozahar_the_corpse_maker> headless boss pat
[0:52:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This game is very very different from a Souls game.
[0:52:38] <BigHugs> You gotta die a huuuuuuge amount of times to have even one NPC die
[0:52:40] <alcors_wisdom> i mean he gets there from teleporting into a buddha statue
[0:52:52] <Tucker0603> what does the confetti do?
[0:52:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @discouragedoblong He did find it in the previous stream, I assume he also went there to recreate this save
[0:52:53] <defectivefire718> @Too_Much_Nukie it looks like it is man
[0:52:56] <+Wintermute_VRC> fight the guy riding on a horse if you haven't already, progression is beyond him
[0:52:59] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat How good are the shortcuts in this game compared to DS1?
[0:53:00] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat whats the best way to make sure people git gud? make it so that if they dont everyone dies
[0:53:01] <sileo_patronus> PogChamp
[0:53:03] <%discouragedoblong> Thanks :)
[0:53:06] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I think I went to the 2nd area too soon, I need to go back to outskirts, I'm at the estate memory but I've not beat any boss yet
[0:53:16] <alcors_wisdom> still on world record pace
[0:53:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @defectivefire718 There's no stamina, for starters. That alone makes a huge difference. There's only 1 weapon, there's no armor.
[0:53:27] <%willjar313> I got a buddy that picked this game up. Gonna go over to his house and check it out tomorrow.
[0:53:31] <Marpolo13> probably because you can jump around on rooftops and shit.
[0:53:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There are no stats.
[0:53:39] <deviljhojho94> not bad!
[0:53:43] <+Ace5335> floating body
[0:53:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can jump and generally move much faster.
[0:53:48] <%Ion_LaserX> apatBig Stealth now
[0:53:51] <leviathan666303> has he gotten the ax yet
[0:53:53] <%magicaki> ...Ironically, you apparently missed the shortcut to the spooky cave.
[0:53:55] <%antarcticwinter> yes i love stealth combat
[0:53:56] <%joylent_blue> sneaky bois
[0:53:56] <defectivefire718> @Too_Much_Nukie you can see the bones of a souls like in this man.
[0:54:01] <Nina96> well u move so fast now shorts are not as useful
[0:54:06] <$Brother_Coduss> purple headless asshole.....HMMM
[0:54:09] <BigHugs> Oh wow I missed that spot
[0:54:10] <JackalKing> Can you play this like Tenchu and just be stealthy the whole way?
[0:54:16] <alcors_wisdom> i wonder if the snap bead things work on him
[0:54:17] <%trnzero> it is guaranteed
[0:54:17] <%joylent_blue> thats fine
[0:54:19] <CaptainFrankincense> you might
[0:54:21] <deviljhojho94> you will, but that is the purpose of this stream, no?
[0:54:22] <stabbityrabbit> Is it fair to call it a straight line when you move vertically all over the place?
[0:54:25] <%magicaki> Pat: Unlock the shortcut before you start the fight!
[0:54:25] <%willjar313> Purple Headless Asshole sounds lie a euphemism for SOMETHING...
[0:54:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> No chance Pat that's what you've got
[0:54:30] <+Tadashi047> you need to watch your terror meter or you get instakilled
[0:54:32] <%magicaki> Turn right!
[0:54:32] <deviljhojho94> We are watching for that pat dont ya worry

[0:54:40] <BigHugs> Where did you get the confetti from?
[0:54:43] <deviljhojho94> We will watch literally anything
[0:54:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @JackalKing Not really, there are some areas you can stealth through but sometimes fighting is inevitable.
[0:54:45] <Rhide1> Can you stealth the ghost?
[0:54:46] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat ah whats the worst that can happen? everyone dying of TB?
[0:54:50] <+Wintermute_VRC> lol this will be interesting to watch
[0:54:59] <MassConnect> Maybe it's just me, but Pat not dying is actually disappointing to me
[0:55:00] <etalmeta> @JackalKing stealth is more of a way to modify combat encounters rather than a way to play
[0:55:04] <$nademonkey1100> and now we wait for crazy talk pat
[0:55:13] <Finakala> That sound is unnerving
[0:55:14] <%joylent_blue> jesus some of the enemies in this are creepy as fuck

[0:56:45] <+phtevenfry> whiskey
[0:56:46] <ranarath> Ah, thanks
[0:56:49] <KasiCrafter> You have something that resists terror, Pat, it's called Git Gud.
[0:56:53] <MassConnect> use Elmo to reduce terror
[0:56:53] <%joylent_blue> so is Terror like Frenzy and Curse
[0:56:54] <captainspauldin> LOL
[0:56:59] <FunkyStreams> you guys see this game got cracked day one
[0:57:06] <+Wintermute_VRC> Terror is instant death basically
[0:57:07] <Rhide1> I think ghosts are the kind of mini-bosses you need to dodge, because fuck terror
[0:57:11] <%joylent_blue> got it
[0:57:12] <Finakala> You need to do more missions and save civilians using your XCOM troops to reduce terror
[0:57:14] <%willjar313> @KasiCrafter It also increases damage resistance.
[0:57:14] <gigacanuck> need more upgrades I see
[0:57:16] <Tucker0603> kill ninja artorias
[0:57:28] <DANIdespalomao> @Tarcanist_ and also love

[0:58:00] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat he's headless, how can he even see where you are?
[0:58:11] <%Remery_> Yea this guy fucked me
[0:58:17] <%willjar313> Git Gud is the most overpowered buff that every FromSoft game has.
[0:58:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That's a cool move
[0:58:19] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> What a fucking badass

[1:09:01] <%joylent_blue> yeah the english voice work in souls and BB was great, this game it doesn't seem like it fits
[1:09:02] <darkbotle> @AngriestPat So, does this game also has some weird online feature like the other Soulsborne games?
[1:09:05] <%willjar313> @MushiIV That's a good question. The answer is Yes.
[1:09:13] <ranarath> No online features
[1:09:14] <gigacanuck> all just preparation for the real thing
[1:09:15] <%joylent_blue> no online in this
[1:09:22] <+HazeNyne> blasphemy
[1:09:24] <MushiIV> I see...
[1:09:25] <%magicaki> Good move, you can get a new skill tree up here.

[1:18:27] <%joylent_blue> PUPPER PARRIED
[1:18:28] <%willjar313> So since Pat is playing a game with ninjas, what is his Nindo?

[1:18:36] <%Zamorouskiwhich> apatJpeg
[1:18:39] <+Tennochief> tommorow is national pupper day
[1:18:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> :I just got here, is this parrying: the game?
[1:18:42] <Make_me_mad> @Enryuan Pat didn't even like Nioh that much.
[1:18:47] <thegreenbenis> N-nani!
[1:18:49] <+misterfistor> I hate the loot aspect of Nioh
[1:18:50] <sir_nack> this really looks like what i wanted out of nioh
[1:18:56] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat will you try out Ghost of Tsushima?
[1:18:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> I really hated Niohs loot system
[1:19:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I don't think we have any idea how fast Pat really am
[1:19:04] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat this is nioh but they made it right
[1:19:09] <%nobunagaesq> gun man is weak as shite lol
[1:19:10] <%magicaki> That's them.
[1:19:10] <Make_me_mad> Funny enough I'm on the other side of this. I loved Nioh and this looks like nothing I'm interested in at all.
[1:19:11] <gustavozxd> well Pat barely played NIOH
[1:19:12] <Finakala> NioH was good but the loot system made it worse
[1:19:12] <yomain> im the opposite i dont like this game anywhere near as much as DS or nioh
[1:19:16] <%joylent_blue> zanzibarian_hamster pretty much
[1:19:17] <pwnhills> RATS
[1:19:17] <Dragon_Batman> Are those huge bamboo hats?
[1:19:17] <+qrhysse> the hats!
[1:19:20] <darkbotle> So, when's the ninja world war story arc in this game?
[1:19:26] <%trnzero> animal name, must be a boss
[1:19:28] <%jiin6> Rats?
[1:19:31] <Saltmeisterr> Hopefully Nioh 2 is better
[1:19:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> When is the great tea race?
[1:19:34] <Schneeeeeebly> Just popped in, looks like a lot of fun, is this a definite purchase for people?
[1:19:34] <%laserbeaming> I want it to be a literal badger
[1:19:35] <+DrBunn> Black hat Logan?
[1:19:36] <%willjar313> Is that blackhat a BIG hat?
[1:19:36] <Tucker0603> another shinobi it sounds like
[1:19:38] <dezimaly> what is this team fortress
[1:19:38] <Finakala> With the right upgrades in NioH 2 it could be legit fantastic
[1:19:39] <Make_me_mad> Like when I found out this game doesn't even have alternate weapons it may as well have just written itself off completely.
[1:19:44] <Marpolo13> rats SwiftRage
[1:19:46] <TwinBat> these are pats
[1:19:46] <gustavozxd> this game is different than nioh though, I wouldn't say it's better or worse

[1:19:47] <+Tennochief> kill it

[1:22:53] <+Shadicara> Thank you tengu friend
[1:22:53] <Jeemukun> So as someone who wants to get both, but hasn't really played any souls or DMC games, should I get DMC5 or Sekiro?
[1:23:00] <+spiegelspike> wait, that dude is tall as shit
[1:23:04] <%Captainahab_37> I loved DMC5
[1:23:06] <%willjar313> How much goo does he have? TENGU!

[1:23:46] <mayorrev> what about crying
[1:23:48] <%Deekman> That's a Blade of the Immortal Reference!

[1:23:52] <$Brother_Coduss> pissed and shidded and farded
[1:23:52] <Hegataro> Gonna cry?
[1:23:53] <deviljhojho94> Oh, gonna cry? Piss your pants maybe? Maybe, shit and cum? tomatoDevious
[1:23:53] <%joylent_blue> Jeemukun Sekiro looks great, but if you're new to these games it also looks super hard, like, harder than other souls-like games
[1:23:55] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> I'm sorry what was that last one?
[1:23:55] <IminyourBase> if you knockout a guy in a fight but you shit your pants at the same time do you win?

[1:25:18] <complicatedclarity> It's pretty rough
[1:25:18] <leviathan666303> devil may cry, devill may piss your pants, maybe devil shit and devil cum @AngriestPat
[1:25:24] <Jeemukun> I probably would have more fun with DMC5, but I'm also a massive weeb so Sekiro is also tempting
[1:25:27] <Thalchampz> GUN PARRY
[1:25:34] <b9k9com> Did pat end up beating the old woman from 3 years ago?

[1:28:50] <gigacanuck> man, they scream like retards
[1:28:52] <gustavozxd> I just killed hell and hell Cerberus ONLY with the faust hat, it's so overpowered
[1:28:59] <%willjar313> So this game seems to reward DPS, am I right about that?
[1:29:14] <Manwad> Going DPS is the way to go.
[1:29:14] <%magicaki> Are you aware you can break contact and go back to stealth by hiding?
[1:29:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@deviljhojho94) (warning)

[1:29:34] <PRchris13> ooof
[1:29:36] <%ScreamingMeat> I started playing Sekiro last night and both the Shinobi Hunter and the Ogre are kicking my ass.

[1:29:42] <Saltmeisterr> overconfidence is a cruel and insidous killer
[1:29:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @willjar313 DPS is your only option, so you're kind of correct.
[1:29:43] <+Wintermute_VRC> It's like a reward for staying tuned
[1:29:44] <TheBeardyStream> was there no penalty for fallint out of bounds?
[1:29:48] <VRNK> 你的尻是死

[1:47:12] <CopperTucker> Fishiki

[1:47:17] <%Konquerer> nishiki style
[1:47:18] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat one is after the deflect, the other is deflection itself
[1:47:20] <darkbotle> As the knowing darf fortress player knows, the carp is the natural enemy to life in itself and they are made out of murder and hatred
[1:47:22] <+ashrv2> def ascending
[1:47:27] <+Tennochief> Aquaman style
[1:47:27] <%Deekman> one's slash up
[1:47:27] <$Kefbar> one is after one is with the deflection
[1:47:28] <Dragon_Batman> Also strikes it sounds like
[1:47:29] <%Deekman> one's slash down
[1:47:32] <Make_me_mad> Ascending means the deflection does more damage. Descending gives them a debuff to posture defense.
[1:47:38] <pshuuu> no, deflection is parry. one lowers posture just for deflecting, the other gives an atk bonus
[1:47:41] <%StewTheGreat> one make the deflection itself do more, one is like a buff to your attacks after the deflection

[2:00:31] <pshuuu> yes, buddha is a little girl
[2:00:31] <%MagickBurritoh> Don't lay a hand on that underaged tapestry
[2:00:33] <%Jpdodds> It might be Buddha
[2:00:34] <Dragon_Batman> That sounds like a problem if you keep going
[2:00:36] <gigacanuck> nah probably just some kid
[2:00:37] <reonome> buddha is a little girl
[2:00:40] <Clyderso> Wheres buddah's best friend, Jesus?
[2:00:41] <Finakala> Iosefka?
[2:00:41] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat have you seen "patches" yet?
[2:00:42] <%HRDSalami654> It is A Buddha.
[2:00:42] <%Deekman> there's gonna be someone on the other side
[2:00:42] <krabthecrab> Buddha can be a waifu
[2:00:44] <+Shadicara> Sounds like you should definitely keep going
[2:00:46] <Tucker0603> kid hiding in the pots?
[2:00:47] <$Brother_Coduss> I AM THE HEAVENLY BUDDHA
[2:00:49] <Bouldus> buddahs a hindu man
[2:00:49] <+misterfistor> there are many Buddha
[2:00:49] <Ezekieru> Maybe a capture-to-new-zone kind of thing?
[2:00:52] <%HRDSalami654> There are multiple Buddhas.
[2:00:53] <b9k9com> Buddha is still angry that you stole the axe
[2:00:54] <pshuuu> buddha is enlightened, of course he wants to be the little girl
[2:00:56] <WarchiefGoldva> Buddha is a thick-thighed loli confirmed.
[2:01:01] <Clyderso> monkaS
[2:01:01] <Manwad> On the roof?
[2:01:01] <%Jpdodds> I think it might be Buddha

[2:01:04] <Bouldus> the original one is hindu
[2:01:04] <%Reizie_Etherealm> My buddha can't possibly be this cute
[2:01:05] <Vohs_Bru> Buddha is a talking rug
[2:01:05] <rekinom> We?
[2:01:06] <%Niney_Who> Buddha being a little girl sounds like a bad Doujinshi
[2:01:06] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat have you seen "patches" yet? is he in the game?
[2:01:07] <gigacanuck> "We"?
[2:01:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Wait

[2:01:48] <+Wintermute_VRC> @AngriestPat That is one branch of four different branches you can go down starting from the castle
[2:01:49] <PRchris13> @AngriestPat wait... patches is here???
[2:01:51] <garbageheaphound> did pat cure the dragonrot yet?
[2:01:55] <%joylent_blue> it won't feel like a Fromsoft game until i see Patches
[2:01:56] <Manwad> That's where you fight the trailer boss yeah?
[2:01:57] <%TeraMercier> What if Patches pushes you down a well and takes your wife-grappling arm
[2:01:58] <Saltmeisterr> when's the moonlight greatsword
[2:02:05] <b9k9com> Have you beat the old woman that throws kunai? @angriestpat
[2:02:09] <%HRDSalami654> Patches is in every Fromsoft game.
[2:02:17] <gigacanuck> @TeraMercier his what?
[2:02:23] <%HRDSalami654> It's an easteregg.
[2:02:23] <%MagickBurritoh> No you gotta capture a guy
[2:02:24] <Tucker0603> isn't the guy in green with the red bandana patches?
[2:02:27] <+Shadicara> So is the moonlight greatsword
[2:02:30] <+Shadicara> Where is it
[2:02:31] <Bouldus> patches and the moonlight greatsword is in almost all fromsoft games

[2:02:54] <%Konquerer> he did her first
[2:02:54] <%Remery_> with lewd traps?
[2:02:56] <WarchiefGoldva> I suppose there's eventually a tool, or skill that lets you catch people alive.
[2:02:57] <Bouldus> where patches is some arsehole with a robot
[2:02:57] <%ScreamingMeat> What makes this guy's Immortality different from Wolf's?
[2:02:58] <Skaw_Lann> i swear that blight town man sounds like patches vo
[2:02:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> I should go kill the old lady, because you are doing more damage than me.
[2:03:01] <+Tennochief> fuck I fell asleep
[2:03:01] <+Promessa_EX> you hold on
[2:03:02] <Vex_Machina> No
[2:03:04] <+Shadicara> Stab them in the throat
[2:03:06] <Manwad> Patches pilots a mech in Armored Core
[2:03:06] <T_Sasquatch> beating old ladies, what are you ? paige LUL
[2:03:07] <Tucker0603> @bad1uck that's his original appearance
[2:03:10] <+Wintermute_VRC> @AngriestPat Go back to the well you began the game in at the tutorial area there's a really cool boss there you will like
[2:03:11] <+Shadicara> That's how you capture
[2:03:14] <+FrithnanthH> Did Paige fall down the well again?
[2:03:16] <Nina96> ???
[2:03:25] <%nobunagaesq> PICK UP Da Phone
[2:03:25] <Omnissam> What exactly is unseen aid?
[2:03:28] <Latch77> @AngriestPat the thing in the cave with the message is a pretty weird optional boss
[2:03:38] <%TeraMercier> Pat used his Brian
[2:03:48] <Vohs_Bru> order EMERGENCY MCDONALDS for Paige
[2:03:50] <+Promessa_EX> does nerd neck increase or decrease damage
[2:03:51] <+Shadicara> Didn't look at the other moves he unlocked though LUL
[2:04:12] <%StatistX> I don't really see Paige playing this game ever
[2:04:34] <+Shadicara> LUL
[2:04:37] <%TeraMercier> I love a game where you can accidentally dash into a sneak backstab instakill
[2:04:37] <Skaw_Lann> you say that but she beat bloodborne
[2:04:37] <Tucker0603> @statistx she'll dir
[2:04:37] <+Tennochief> This doesn't seem like his kind of game
[2:04:39] <T_Sasquatch> I find it funny how this may become the hardest fromsoft game and people were worried
[2:04:39] <garbageheaphound> fuck that
[2:04:41] <WarchiefGoldva> Paige beat Ebrietas first try, never forget.
[2:04:43] <Master_Moridin> Am always amused by *picks up item that tells him where upgrade is, goes opposite direction*
[2:04:43] <Skaw_Lann> and dark souls
[2:04:44] <+Shadicara> Time to exorcise the demo pat
[2:04:45] <CaptainFrankincense> hahahaha

[2:05:05] <Essixian> THE BACKDOWN
[2:05:10] <+Tennochief> are there any cute or hot girls for Plague to draw from this game?
[2:05:16] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat there's more in this area
[2:05:17] <%StatistX> @T_Sasquatch I'm worried, cause I bought it and barely got through all the other games, but I feel I'm going to pull a Nioh here and give up midway through
[2:05:27] <+Will_The_Soulless> Hey @AngriestPat hows the PC version?
[2:05:33] <+Shadicara> Where do you even get that confetti?
[2:05:34] <+Wintermute_VRC> Go back to the start of the tutorial zone there's a boss in the well you started the game in
[2:05:35] <$Brother_Coduss> divine confetti?
[2:05:43] <WarchiefGoldva> Almost no enemy in this game wear pants and that bothers me for some reason.
[2:05:44] <Tucker0603> @tennochief Emma? maybe? but she ain't got no fur...
[2:05:51] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat there's a divine gate that you can drop down to the REAL blight town
[2:05:53] <Essixian> @Tennochief Only one I've seen so far is the lady who upgrades your gourd. Also possibly the BOI, but that might be illegal.
[2:05:54] <+TetsuyaD> it's not great
[2:06:26] <%HRDSalami654> You're confetti ain't even heavy.
[2:06:29] <Tucker0603> @essixian that's Shadman's territory on the second one
[2:06:30] <T_Sasquatch> @StatistX literally why i didnt bother buying sekiro, i know from soft, i cant be bothered to pay full price for a game that will take me months. Idropped bloodborne for 2 years before i beat father gascoigne

[2:07:13] <rekinom> Big Hat Logan doesn't fuck around in this one
[2:07:17] <%StatistX> @T_Sasquatch yeah but I feel you have more possibilities to balance out your player deficits, like here it's strongly relying on parry, but I suck at parry and dodging seems wonky
[2:07:17] <Ezekieru> Use the axe?
[2:07:20] <%MagickBurritoh> strong hat
[2:07:21] <+mysterypork> Does that hat count as a shield?

[2:08:59] <+Shadicara> Who let melee gremlins into this game LUL
[2:08:59] <$rytyoung> So is this game Pat's answer for not beating Nioh?
[2:09:01] <%willjar313> Yeah, I know. I'm a total AXEhole.
[2:09:03] <%StewTheGreat> I think you have enough money for the gourd seed now
[2:09:05] <WarchiefGoldva> @Tennochief Holy shit, that explains everything.
[2:09:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TheOnlyStrayCat Is it a different one from the one last night?
[2:09:09] <%Tenebrae94> @angriestpat you can get the gourd seed now
[2:09:11] <%HRDSalami654> Jumping in a Fromsoft game? It's more likely than you'd think.
[2:09:12] <Zer0beats> Can you run on the walls?
[2:09:14] <Rhide1> @AngriestPat You got enough cash for the gourd thingy now. Probably
[2:09:25] <%TeraMercier> Does this game control as beautifly as it looks?
[2:09:31] <IminyourBase> it's the damn bridge again!
[2:09:32] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @Too_Much_Nukie Dunno, onlyy just was made aware of it.
[2:09:38] <%Reizie_Etherealm> The goblin looks like Axel F crazy frog
[2:09:40] <+Shadicara> You did tengu man good
[2:09:45] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat is Emma Kira Buckland
[2:10:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TheOnlyStrayCat Paradox streamed the reveal on Twitch. Had a bunch of nerds on-stage pretending to be vampires.
[2:10:05] <+storkeylope> How are the English voices in this?
[2:10:05] <%ScreamingMeat> This SHIELDED guy is so tough. If only I had an AXE or something to split it open!
[2:10:06] <jorgeniev> when are you getting punchline
[2:10:09] <$rytyoung> @angriestpat thoughts so far?
[2:10:21] <%JayEarly> @reizie_etherealm god damn it
[2:10:22] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @Too_Much_Nukie Oh, it was the one last night. Just checked it.
[2:10:24] <WarchiefGoldva> Kira's doing some work.
[2:10:26] <%Deekman> Better than DMCV?
[2:10:35] <%MarylandJutsu> wait is Kira in this game @WarchiefGoldva ?
[2:10:43] <WarchiefGoldva> I don't know.
[2:10:44] <+Tennochief> this game is definetly not better
[2:10:45] <%MarylandJutsu> I know Ray Chase is in this game
[2:10:50] <%MarylandJutsu> aka Noctis
[2:10:52] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Pffft, for real, @Too_Much_Nukie ? That is fucking dorky as shit I love it.
[2:10:54] <$rytyoung> it's gonna be hard to top DMC V
[2:11:03] <T_Sasquatch> yeyeyye
[2:11:06] <%JayEarly> DC Douglas is the narrator
[2:11:06] <%Deekman> Better than Resident Evil 2?
[2:11:11] <T_Sasquatch> DMCV GOTY
[2:11:18] <+Tennochief> I don't think this game can even be compared to DMC5
[2:11:25] <+Tennochief> they're way too different
[2:11:29] <%MarylandJutsu> god WHEN IS THE OST OF DMC5 gonna be on English Spotify
[2:11:32] <%ScreamingMeat> DMC5 and REmake2 are kind of untouchable at the moment
[2:11:33] <+wondermustard> is it better than watching jesus die on the cross?
[2:11:34] <+Tennochief> she's cute
[2:11:35] <%supersugoisenpai1> DMC 5 is fun, this game is super frustrating
[2:11:36] <AllenDeadman> give her your seed Kreygasm
[2:11:36] <Zer0beats> @Zer0beats is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:11:37] <%Fenrirlives> Give her THE SEEED
[2:11:40] <%Nobrev> GOORD
[2:11:41] <%StatistX> Now I just want Bloodborne 2, hell I'd even go for another Souls, even though I never thought I'd wish for a DS4
[2:11:42] <thegreenbenis> Gave her your seed.

[2:11:47] <WarchiefGoldva> VoHiYo VoHiYo
[2:11:50] <Tucker0603> seed
[2:11:56] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Hi @Zer0beats
[2:11:57] <%Deekman> I'm feeling Sekiro as my Goty so far. I just hope it sticks the landing.
[2:12:02] <T_Sasquatch> @MarylandJutsu but it is.....
[2:12:02] <%Rellim80> You're getting taller
[2:12:11] <+Shadicara> Nah you'll always get someone who comes out saying DMC 5 and Resi 2 remake are shit. Mainly because they can't play either game
[2:12:12] <darkbotle> I'm glad they From isn't the "souls company" anymore. That formular was getting tired
[2:12:21] <zoranbiocic> VoHiYo

[2:12:30] <Zer0beats> @TheOnlyStrayCat Hi!

[2:13:03] <+Tennochief> kill all the uggos
[2:13:03] <+Shadicara> Tenguman is pleased pat
[2:13:07] <CaptainFrankincense> seems bad
[2:13:09] <%HRDSalami654> Kira Buckland is not in this game as far as my quick research says.
[2:13:21] <TwinBat> didn't he not even beat the first game?
[2:13:35] <WarchiefGoldva> LUL
[2:13:43] <+Shadicara> Very soon
[2:13:47] <almostgotpitted> Is this dark souls?
[2:13:48] <NickWearsGlasses> these are some MGS level guards
[2:13:48] <+Shadicara> Like right now
[2:13:48] <%ScreamingMeat> These guys suck at their job
[2:13:48] <%Konquerer> don't worry about it
[2:13:50] <mrkerb> Has some who is bad at parrying, will this game be tough?
[2:13:52] <darkbotle> are these MGS guards?

[2:14:08] <+toadlyy> @mrkerb YES
[2:14:10] <VRNK> could you imagine how terrifying itd be to be the guy not killed first
[2:14:10] <%StatistX> @mrkerb as someone who IS bad at parrying, I'd say yes it is tough
[2:14:16] <+the_krypto_knight> wherever could this stealthy man be? Certainly not standing out in the open 1 flight of stairs up
[2:14:32] <Essixian> I always feel terrible killing doggos BibleThump

[2:20:35] <Rhide1> The hole in the wall
[2:20:43] <+ashrv2> there's an item outside the back on the 2nd floor
[2:20:43] <+mysterypork> Isn't there an item not far from where you begin the game?
[2:20:43] <Bouldus> i think thats all its really for
[2:20:46] <+Wintermute_VRC> @AngriestPat you missed a grapple point that leads back to the well you started the game in by the dude banging a pot
[2:20:48] <+mercilust> can you reach the roof?
[2:20:51] <gigacanuck> so let's be clear: when we all go ask Plague top make porn of this game, it has to be Sekiro giving Emma his seed
[2:20:52] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat anything in the well you started in?
[2:20:52] <%ScreamingMeat> Go back to the well
[2:20:58] <gigacanuck> we have to use that innuendo
[2:21:02] <VRNK> no
[2:21:03] <Rhide1> There is an item on the roof tho
[2:21:04] <%willjar313> That's why Seath was the only mortal dragon. His Dragon Souls was filled with bitch.
[2:21:11] <AllenDeadman> huh
[2:21:23] <%ScreamingMeat> Quick fall of the cliff again
[2:21:29] <%wsintai> @gigacanuck You know Plague is gonna have the Shota do it instead

[2:32:46] <Make_me_mad> I watched a guy trivialize this boss fight (and like five others) just sidestepping and doing the evade slash over and over.
[2:32:49] <+FrithnanthH> Pat would be confused if at some point he gets stabbed in the back by a comrade whilst standing on a mountain of the corpses of people he betrayed and ask, "What did I do to deserve this?"
[2:32:54] <Nina96> does he have 1 arm?
[2:32:55] <Bouldus> Pat ran into a guy liek this yesterday
[2:32:55] <IminyourBase> if artorias had a kick he'd be too perfect
[2:32:57] <%StatistX> This guy probably has both arms, but only NEEDS one

[2:42:06] <+misterfistor> bad run
[2:42:08] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is dodging ineffective in this game?
[2:42:08] <Zer0beats> maybe, you need to come back
[2:42:09] <+WorldsBestPanda> Why does Pat only do well when he doesn't get the free hit???
[2:42:17] <steph_the_doll> i wonder if you can do two drop attacks on this guy
[2:42:26] <%mesirel> mesirel subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! scrub
[2:42:27] <VRNK> CAMÈRA
[2:42:27] <abakkus> fuuuck this camera man jesus
[2:42:28] <T_Sasquatch> Is dragon rot for if you die or if you revive ?
[2:42:33] <Dao_Puppy> You know what this fight needs? This fights needs DOGS.
[2:42:34] <+misterfistor> i think the only reason you're losing is the goddamn camera
[2:42:34] <thegreenbenis> @plainsimpletailor No Pat is just dumb.
[2:42:35] <%joylent_blue> PlainSimpleTailor i've heard it has fewer i-frames than you'd expect
[2:42:36] <BinaryShuffle> 死
[2:42:38] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 78
[2:42:38] <%ScreamingMeat> Stay away from the fog wall, it only causes problems
[2:42:39] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Well, I looked into it; Kira Buckland is not Emma; Emma is voiced by KYRIEEEEE
[2:42:39] <$valriot> So why is Pat streaming so early? Plan to stream the FFXIV keynote later?
[2:42:39] <FatSquirrelsCry> LUL
[2:42:40] <+Qsmash_> @AngriestPat does hitting him with a shuriken while hes in the air do anything?
[2:42:40] <%connos_livereview> There is no need to be upset
[2:42:41] <TwinBat> I'm a big fan of this guy
[2:42:41] <+Wintermute_VRC> The real boss of this fight is the camera
[2:42:41] <fmc009> @T_Sasquatch revive
[2:42:41] <+Tennochief> 死
[2:42:44] <+zaworldo> Dragonrot only spreads if you die and come back at a shrine
[2:42:45] <dan_g_v> mash buttons Pat, mash harder! Hardest!
[2:42:46] <b9k9com> Pat, get the shotgun
[2:42:49] <IminyourBase> how much salt can one child sized man generate, lets find out?
[2:42:49] <TwinBat> he's very cool
[2:42:50] <b9k9com> cap him
[2:42:55] <+zaworldo> Reviving doesn't spread it
[2:42:57] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat why don't use some of those abilities you have?
[2:42:59] <%StatistX> I heard people say it's dieing in general
[2:42:59] <Jalexster> I've heard someone say that it happened to him and he never revived
[2:42:59] <%kenpachi9211> @zaworldo REVIVES COUNT
[2:43:01] <+Tennochief> is it 78 now?
[2:43:02] <%joylent_blue> oh is it Stephanie Sheh? cool
[2:43:04] <$SleepyMaribo> what is dragon rot?
[2:43:08] <+oOZtkOo> ive revived some in my game, but havent died much and no one has dragon rot yet
[2:43:12] <sylveonIRL> is this the dark souls of ninjas
[2:43:13] <VRNK> chat is the last person to trust on this
[2:43:15] <+zaworldo> @kenpachi9211 THEY LITERALLY DON'T THOUGH
[2:43:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> nah, people are getting dragonrot in my game without me reviving
[2:43:18] <Shyakuuu> Male Vierra inc? PogChamp LUL
[2:43:26] <dan_g_v> dragonrot is magic disease affecting people over firelink shrine
[2:43:28] <Finakala> Male Viera dream is over
[2:43:28] <%joylent_blue> SleepyMaribo basically if you die a lot the NPCs in the game get sick
[2:43:29] <thecasket> At least Pat has the stealth attack down
[2:43:31] <fmc009> @SleepyMaribo dragon rot is like a curse you give npcs for reviving it seems
[2:43:32] <Jalexster> So maybe it's both revives and deaths that do it?
[2:43:34] <+oOZtkOo> jury is out it seems
[2:43:35] <%Tarcanist_> you might half to go back to the hospital for impacted bowels cause he keeps pushing your shit in Kappa @angriestpat
[2:43:37] <dan_g_v> the more you revive, the hardest they eat it
[2:43:42] <+zaworldo> Revives don't count, it's only when you come back at a shrine.
[2:43:46] <Jalexster> Dragonrot is basically World Tendency 2.0
[2:43:49] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 79
[2:43:51] <%StatistX> @Jalexster I think it's just dropping in general

[2:50:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PlainSimpleTailor His name is Wolf. The Tengu named him Sekiro though.
[2:50:10] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 that's right pat, it's your shitty sugar daddy here once again, with a particularly sweet treat for all of you. I was talking to a friend, and she shared her recipe for a particularly succulent pie with me. While I won't share her exact recipe, I WILL tell you the method to making a supremely moist pie. The trick is fruit juice. You see, when you bake it, set it nice and low, and without the top when it goes in the oven, throw in some juice! The idea is to listen till you hear it
[2:50:10] <%ScreamingMeat> Geralt, Welsh Weeb Geralt, and Japanese Geralt
[2:50:12] <+Wintermute_VRC> Blight-motherfucking-town
[2:50:12] <%Tarcanist_> take the plunge and find out
[2:50:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> John Sekiro, Wolf Marine
[2:50:18] <darkbotle> Man, this game really screams FROM SOFTWARE in your face, from the NPC's to the level design
[2:50:21] <+Shadicara> YES
[2:50:21] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 start to sizzle, scream or pop, you pull it out, smother the pie in the blanket top, then finish its tenure in the oven. This makes the juice make the insides just a little sticky, acting as a bonding agent, keeping the pie together, and giving it a firm bottom. Tldr; for a moist as drool pie, when it's in the oven, add juice!
[2:50:22] <Saltmeisterr> LUL
[2:50:23] <JT137> oh no

[3:12:38] <Ragnorok64> does it have the same weird story and side quest structure as the Souls'likes? where if you do one obscure thing out of order you get locked out of story?
[3:12:39] <BourneRussian7> My god this game looks amazing
[3:12:49] <Jalexster> I hope this game has Mimics in the form of enemies hiding-inside-chests

[3:13:39] <CalderGaming> @Ragnorok64 i dunno about progression blocker pitfalls, but you do need to be this game's equivalent of Human to progress NPC stories
[3:13:41] <%willjar313> The game has now become Metal Gear.

[3:14:11] <+Promessa_EX> this kind of looks like mgr stealth
[3:14:17] <fmc009> is there an actual distinction between boss and mini boss?
[3:14:24] <CalderGaming> @Ragnorok64 where you "hollow" after choosing to Resurrect instead of just Die a certain number of times
[3:14:24] <brunoberserk> now the game is really looking like tenchu

[3:20:01] <SlimeBoogey> From what ive seen most areas allow you to stealth a few enemies but youre eventually forced into combat
[3:20:06] <+misterfistor> try and use the fireworks ninja arm for aoe stun
[3:20:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> According to Wikipedia, bushido is the Samurai code of ethics. nothing to do with ninjas

[3:40:00] <%ScreamingMeat> Pat have you ever tried Sake IRL?
[3:40:00] <%lewdskeletor13> The English VA is pretty solid so it’s not that big a deal
[3:40:12] <darkbotle> when do we get a sekiro skin for nero?
[3:40:12] <%king_wragles> Sake is kinda gross
[3:40:14] <+Shadicara> The last one is buster arm Kappa
[3:40:20] <$HentaiSenpai9K> It hurts my ears

[3:40:43] <+Wintermute_VRC> You're not even halfway through the game yet
[3:40:45] <+Shadicara> Sake is fine when it's warm
[3:40:47] <mrgrimsmiles> i think your missing the umbra shield
[3:40:48] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Or maybe the idea is that you do not get everything. Replayability.
[3:40:48] <%Kage_96> Might be multiple playthroughs
[3:40:49] <Vohs_Bru> the Longest
[3:40:50] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I fine all alcohol disgusting
[3:40:51] <+thesw1tch> all you saying sake is gross never had good sake
[3:40:51] <%superc37> tbh the english dub is better than the japanese dub
[3:40:51] <%Plague_Nurse> I'm told it's short
[3:40:51] <$HentaiSenpai9K> 50 hours Pat
[3:40:53] <%HRDSalami654> You are drinking the wrong shit if you think sake is bad.
[3:40:53] <%Zamorouskiwhich> The top of the castle is the final boss Kappa

[3:42:14] <gigacanuck> wait wealth orb first
[3:42:18] <$milhousego> cheer1000 hey Pat, just wanted to say thanks for the always taking the edge off , especially now. my little bro is currently recovering from a brain surgery needed after a sinus infection spread to his brain and he's been recovering in the hospital. He's temporarily lost use of his left leg and arm as his right brain was affected, and he is super cranky from being poked and prodded by doctors. he'll need months of physical therapy to recover. Still he's a hell of a trooper for a 10 year old!
[3:42:22] <+TheoTTree> give the drank
[3:42:25] <FstSergeant8595> so far I have put 6.5 hours into this game.... my god this game is hard
[3:42:28] <WarchiefGoldva> Do y'all also remember that big-ass longsword you can eventually get? What is up with that?
[3:42:30] <+BadxKiid> @AngriestPat how does this game rank against dark souls and bloodborne?
[3:42:32] <pigeontactician> let the man drink
[3:42:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder why the Japanese likes to name their katanas something that ends with maru, onimaru, juzumaru, sabimaru
[3:42:47] <Shyakuuu> Paige will protect us for the holy offering of macdonel PogChamp
[3:42:53] <+thesw1tch> @milhousego holy shit. best of luck my dude!

[3:43:24] <r_Foeburden87> ENG dub*
[3:43:27] <Dragon_Batman> Sorry to hear that @milhousego Hope he keeps at it
[3:43:27] <$cureneckbeard> That sucks but yesterday a guy shit his pants
[3:43:30] <arfsm95> this reminds me a LOT of dororo
[3:43:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Karakuri tsukai
[3:43:36] <%Ascethetic> youll NEVER compare to DOGEN
[3:43:38] <gigacanuck> @Reizie_Etherealm IIRC 'maru' is the thing you put at the end of boys names
[3:43:40] <$D4C_Trice> @angriestpat do you know how to blacklist someone in FFXIV? this anus keeps sending me a guild invite and I've tried to add him to the blacklist but their names not valid.
[3:43:41] <%lewdskeletor13> This English dub is quality

[3:44:09] <Reanimator83> SeemsGood
[3:44:11] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat have you seen an anime called dororo? this game reminds me a lot of it

[3:44:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> People were saying the English dub was bad the other day, but it sounds perfectly fine to me

[3:59:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> No Pat you're the final boss
[3:59:27] <$valriot> @mexrage Hell yes. Feel like Capcom can hit that sweet spot between this and Nioh in terms of gameplay and design
[3:59:30] <%GarbageNirvana> How is the English VA in this game anyway
[3:59:33] <+8framelag> whos the betrayer
[3:59:37] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Yeah I thought ringing the two bells would be the end too

[4:05:50] <%king_wragles> WUT
[4:05:53] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat some guy throws a shuriken at you, and he cuts your arm
[4:05:54] <hassanico> @AngriestPat Someone throws a shuriken at you
[4:05:55] <%joylent_blue> nothing, he cheap shots you anyway
[4:05:55] <+Shadicara> You're probably a cool gangster for beating him in the first fight
[4:06:01] <Jakeofalco> he cheats
[4:06:01] <b9k9com> he cuts your arm off if you win or lose @angriestpat
[4:06:02] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat and says "it's about winning, not honor"
[4:06:03] <%Konquerer> probably same as dragon god punch
[4:06:13] <silverglove2012> you would stream when I was about to watch a moive
[4:06:20] <daedri> This is very anime.

[4:06:51] <%joylent_blue> you have returned to the Vergil fight @lewdskeletor13
[4:06:53] <+Das_Prints> You knock him down and the tengu that kidnaps the kid throws a weapon at you and you deflect it which gives genichiro an opening to cut your arm off. I heard it changes his dialogue when you face him later too but haven’t confirmed it.

[4:08:46] <%MagickBurritoh> Virugiru

[4:10:23] <%ElenaManetta> JUMP
[4:10:24] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @hassanico A tomoe is the japanese comma-like symbols you see on flags and banners and such. It is related to the Japanese Shinto Buddhism and the god of war
[4:10:25] <TooOldForGaming> I'm absolutely loving this game destroying all the "Souls pros" who are not ready to admit Souls games require exploiting the game rather than mastering actual mechanics XD
[4:10:26] <%ElenaManetta> BLOCK IT
[4:10:26] <%joylent_blue> at least its a quick run back
[4:10:27] <aimlesshealer> Absorb his dick lightning

[4:11:31] <fmc009> what's the fastest way to recover posture?
[4:11:43] <pshuuu> doing nothing
[4:11:46] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 99
[4:11:46] <arfsm95> stop attacking and run fmc
[4:11:47] <Nina96> not gonna lie this games combat has got me more hyped than any souls game
[4:11:49] <braincraft> Is there a reason he keeps eating the huge telegraphed overheads instead of dodging? Does it track or something?
[4:11:50] <demegodz> The sword clang is such a satisfying sound
[4:11:55] <PRchris13> oooh.. that slash
[4:11:56] <aimlesshealer> @TooOldForGaming I love that the phrase "Souls cheese" actually means something. LUL
[4:11:56] <fmc009> thanks
[4:12:01] <%joylent_blue> TooOldForGaming "Dark Souls combat is so deep and complex guys" literally circle strafing and dodging on repeat. THIS requires actual execution and timing
[4:12:04] <pshuuu> or do the combat art that pat is using
[4:12:12] <pshuuu> it regens your posture too
[4:12:13] <+8framelag> running though resets both yours and his poise..
[4:12:14] <Thalchampz> damn
[4:12:18] <+pabloelenano2> @braincraft it tracks and has a follow up
[4:12:19] <GoldeNOVA> Pat you have to use the arms more
[4:12:29] <$Mozahar_the_corpse_maker> pat can do it
[4:12:34] <reonome> oh god people arguing over sekiro vs souls sbfpSetIn
[4:12:34] <Shyakuuu> Pat getting this a lot faster than most at least
[4:12:35] <TooOldForGaming> Yup, I love it, Fromsoft trolls their entire fanbase by making a game that requires actual mechanical skill

[4:13:23] <Shyakuuu> Yoooo
[4:13:24] <Zojobo> People forget Souls as a series is an Action RPG. The RPG part plays a big role. This is a purely action game, which means more mechanical skill and execution instead of big number.

[4:13:39] <+Das_Prints> I found fire not too bad on a lot of the duels since hitting them twice usually puts the burning effect on them if you don’t use oil. The stub from the burn and the dot are pretty strong. I don’t know if that works for this guy though.

[4:50:27] <$D4C_Trice> @doc_ock_rokc I had some awful nachos recently, it was just a wrap throw in the oven with no seasoning, not even a corn tortilla and they stopped using BBQ pulled pork
[4:50:40] <+FoulNightingale> Sup Pat? Is this Pat eats at?
[4:50:50] <%Konquerer> did you just rub that in your pants???
[4:50:52] <%lewdskeletor13> What even is Poutine? I genuinely don’t know
[4:50:56] <$renyrells> @AngriestPat if i own but havent played nioh is there any reason to get sekiro
[4:50:59] <dukenux> Saturn Eating His Poutine
[4:51:05] <%JJCheeker> It's French fries with gravy cheese and meat
[4:51:05] <b9k9com> You need to put some McDonalds on that Poutine @angriestpat
[4:51:08] <aimlesshealer> @lewdskeletor13 it has somethign to do with cheese curds, that's all I know
[4:51:11] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 beef gravy, thick chips, unpasteurised cheese curds
[4:51:11] <%Nobrev> I ordered out last night and got some really good beef tendon pho
[4:51:15] <complicatedclarity> @lewdskeletor13 it's like fries cheese and gravy
[4:51:17] <Spyderninja> can you please repeat that bit about the late game choice?
[4:51:19] <+TheoTTree> DS3 ends well
[4:51:20] <%dooberoo> penis
[4:51:20] <%ElenaManetta> But that's most modern games because of the whole, "We did a study and % of players don't beat the game, so why spend time on the ending" thing
[4:51:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Konquerer Those aren't pants, they're leg napkins
[4:51:21] <%dave323dave> what you don't like dragon butts?
[4:51:21] <KungFuStarfish> Its bitter sweet?
[4:51:21] <$valriot> DS3 ended alright
[4:51:24] <Silent_Fyraena> Lost Izalith is bad but I liked the other post-Anor-Londo areas...
[4:51:29] <%Sovspot> I thought Bloodborne ended pretty okay.
[4:51:31] <Dao_Puppy> Don't care what anyone says, Dragon Aerie is tight.
[4:51:34] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Moon presence isn't that hard at all
[4:51:34] <%Konquerer> @rumtumtugnutz i see
[4:51:39] <+HypestMoose> Moon presence looks cool at least
[4:51:55] <%Trabnaxes> Dark Souls 3: Souls Die Twice
[4:51:57] <$OranHexthief> XIV stream is up
[4:51:58] <$valriot> Bloodborne ends kinda poorly yeah. Nightmare and Mergo are fine but not that exciting
[4:52:08] <KungFuStarfish> Lets get niohs kelly
[4:52:14] <dukenux> man everyone's playing Sekiro
[4:52:19] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What kind of consumer doesn't fully consume their product?
[4:52:19] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat those arent people those be scrubs
[4:52:20] <Nina96> @AngriestPat u think were gonna see the moonlight great sword?
[4:52:26] <FatSquirrelsCry> LOVE FROM MONCTON
[4:52:28] <$valriot> Completion % are always low
[4:52:29] <Dragon_Batman> Nioh's Kelly was pretty neat
[4:52:31] <b9k9com> Yeah, like the fight when you lost your arm, fucking amazing
[4:52:35] <avatar_beifong_v2> I'm not even gonna buy it
[4:52:41] <JackalKing> Maybe more people would finish games if they didn't put all the cool shit right at the beginning
[4:52:43] <%Konquerer> my brother left his save sitting outside the gehrman fight for 2 years and i bugged him about it every week
[4:52:44] <garbageheaphound> a boss willl probably wield it
[4:52:46] <sir_nack> @Reizie_Etherealm the average one, it seems
[4:52:47] <%JJCheeker> That looks good I wish I ate that for dinner
[4:52:50] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Maybe a Moonlight Odachi
[4:52:52] <stabbityrabbit> I think you're gonna see the moonlight great-arm.
[4:52:52] <waifoong98> Meh, it is probably gonna be pros or ninjutsu or some shit
[4:52:55] <leviathan666303> a boss probably haas it
[4:52:55] <aimlesshealer> So do you fight any crazy Japanese mythological shit in this?

[4:52:58] <%dooberoo> @angriestpat donations? love you
[4:53:01] <TheBlankAce> You gonna check out the place the Buddha scroll warned you about?
[4:53:01] <%lovebass4stuff> moonlight is the best sowrd
[4:53:07] <FeedbacK7777> @AngriestPat Think yamato fits in that arm sheathe?
[4:53:08] <%RubberFistFight> i sincerely hope NO moonlight greatsword, because Fromsoft are doing something different from Souls
[4:53:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I don't wanna fight a Kapa
[4:53:09] <KungFuStarfish> I guess sekiros main characters asian guts
[4:53:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @aimlesshealer Not yet at least.
[4:53:10] <%RubberFistFight> and I like that
[4:53:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Has there been any overt Souls reference character?
[4:53:12] <zebult> moonlight small knife
[4:53:14] <JackalKing> Moonlight Nodachi
[4:53:14] <nativegypsy217> pat fanfest is starting in 1 hour you excited?
[4:53:14] <$valriot> Yeah Nioh ends really well then the DLC kinda throws bullshit at you, then ends alright
[4:53:19] <Thalchampz> moonlight zanbato
[4:53:20] <waifoong98> Moonlight is overrated, Dark Moonlight is better Kappa
[4:53:22] <%dooberoo> moon light axe
[4:53:24] <Silent_Fyraena> What's this game like for people who like exporing and shortcuts, but not so much combat?
[4:53:25] <PRchris13> @AngriestPat do you think there is going to be a moonlight greatsword?
[4:53:29] <complicatedclarity> moonlight stick
[4:53:32] <%dooberoo> dead air
[4:53:35] <%Ninestempest> @Silent_Fyraena lol no
[4:53:35] <waifoong98> @Silent_Fyraena poison basically
[4:53:35] <%Rayorin> woah is this a mukbang now?
[4:53:35] <%RubberFistFight> I mean they tried something different with DS2 and everyone whinged, they went back to formula with DS3 and everyone whinged.
[4:53:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I've seen pictures of Sekiro with another sword on his back, I wonder what and when that will be
[4:53:41] <AllenDeadman> moonlight shurikens
[4:53:44] <+Mukkeym1212> He’s gonna blast a poutine fart
[4:53:45] <Silent_Fyraena> Okay, skipping this one then :P

Oh, and was it just me, or was that merchant you rescued sound like he wanted into your pants?

[5:45:28] <%philoboy123> You can only keep a technique secret by not using it, why is the point to make a technique if you don't use it?

[5:46:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Imma stab that snek in its something it don't stop playing
[5:46:24] <Bouldus> oh this area
[5:46:26] <%RubberFistFight> the only thing wrong with it really is the two huge front fangs
[5:46:27] <garbageheaphound> i think Pat needs to be able to dive
[5:46:27] <SnaKemuho> you thought it was snek, but it is I, gunblade

[5:46:44] <%SaltyDongs> Sword weak to gun
[5:46:47] <garbageheaphound> or maybe not
[5:46:48] <%gespenst25> gespenst25 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Hi Pat. Watching this stream while I wait for Naoki Yoshida's Keynote Adderss [SIC] to begin.
[5:46:48] <KungFuStarfish> Its a final fantasy
[5:46:51] <dukenux> Fucking hell, you can block gun shot
[5:46:53] <garbageheaphound> i might be crazy
[5:47:06] <aimlesshealer> Why do Japanese trees always be growin out of cliffs like that?
[5:47:10] <Bouldus> for if you fall
[5:47:14] <%Konquerer> Rifle Spear dudes
[5:47:15] <pectusumbra> to climb out from the bottom I imagine
[5:47:18] <Thalchampz> because japanese trees are old
[5:47:21] <%alexandrecau> leap of faith
[5:47:21] <Deagle117> take the plunge you won't die lol
[5:47:22] <+bear_breaker20> Aesthetic
[5:47:24] <KungFuStarfish> Leap of faith?
[5:47:25] <SnaKemuho> @aimlesshealer so that ninjas could climb them
[5:47:49] <%MagickBurritoh> hall wuggin
[5:47:50] <+bear_breaker20> You can always just blame it on aesthetic...
[5:48:05] <%TheQButton> these sections remind me of uncharted.
[5:48:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No you can't.
[5:48:09] <KungFuStarfish> Ominous
[5:48:17] <+Tennochief> knew it
[5:48:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's pretty fucking rare for a game to put grapple points just for aesthetic.
[5:48:39] <dukenux> aka Blorb fragment
[5:48:42] <AllenDeadman> theese fucks importing riflespears from yharnam
[5:48:44] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I think ya need that metal fan
[5:48:44] <aimlesshealer> So many features of Japanese landscapes I thought were just cartoons and shit, only to discover it's actually like that there. Japan is pretty neat
[5:48:46] <+bear_breaker20> sure ok
[5:48:47] <ospreyworks> How is it, so far?
[5:48:52] <CatmanIX> how's the game so far? missed yesterdays stream
[5:48:54] <%ace_cfa44> pat did you ever beat headless?
[5:48:59] <Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat is there any benefit to deflecting bullets? it doesn't seem to decrease the shooter's posture
[5:48:59] <Cymen90> This FEELS way more like Dark Souls in the level design....maybe DS2.
[5:49:23] <dukenux> Those levels seem more open to me than DS
[5:49:24] <%RageKingDomo> How far along is he? As in what boss did he kill last
[5:49:24] <jimmychiken> Can you sheath when out of combat?
[5:49:29] <zebult> sometimes this game reminds me of a completely unreleated game, only relatio is activision
[5:49:30] <dukenux> maybe because of the grappling hook
[5:49:34] <KungFuStarfish> Thats it?
[5:49:37] <%MelBrooksKA> @CatmanIX Awful, Pat is having so much fun spyCappa
[5:49:43] <blackjackskellington> i really feel like there's going to be a gun arm
[5:49:46] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Cliff side shrines and gravestones reminds me of Afro Samurai
[5:49:47] <%RubberFistFight> @dukenux yeah the verticality in this game is great
[5:49:47] <complicatedclarity> my Wi-Fi has decided it would like to suck ass for a while.

I've been trying new stuff, 40k mods for xcom, p5, dead cells, and been researching this crazy tabletop called shadowrun. Lore is crazy. Quicknotes version on 1d40chan is funny. America unites with canada after the west splits off to do it's own thing, and we elect a literal dragon as president.

[6:02:52] <%PlainSimpleTailor> At some point people will be forced to come to the conclusion that Miyazaki's just ...well, a prick. Not now, but eventually he's going to prioritize difficulty to the point where the games just disappear into their own rectums.

[6:03:47] <%RubberFistFight> @PlainSimpleTailor did you see him basically explaining away Paige's Bloodborne success by saying it's because of Pat's support and she was "using a weapon that staggers everything and that's not playing right"?
[6:03:48] <a_mad_dragon> why doesn't dante have moves like that with the kalina ann?
[6:03:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PlainSimpleTailor The difficulty aspect of the games is really more of a marketing thing than anything in the actual games. Except for Dark Souls 2 maybe.

[6:05:00] <ChoculaUltra> this is one of the few games where I legit considered doing the whole pact with the Robot Devil for more competent hands deal
[6:05:03] <%lewdskeletor13> This game feels like it was designed to be speedrunned
[6:05:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The magnetic mechanism makes you defend from all directions.

[6:05:46] <%RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 to me it feels like Miyazaki was having a bad month and just made a super-hard game with a shittily spiteful death penalty.
[6:06:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The death penalty is meaningless tbh.
[6:06:13] <SnaKemuho> yeah it does, things cost a shitton and bosses don't give a lot
[6:06:14] <+Michael_Erazo> game just came out, how do you guys know?
[6:06:18] <%RubberFistFight> "oh, if you die too much, important npcs will get sick and die too, and then you can't upgrade, and you'll be stuck. Is that hard enough for you?"
[6:06:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can cure NPCs.
[6:06:27] <+Wintermute_VRC> lol wtf are you talking about, death in this game is super forgiving compared to dark souls
[6:06:30] <complicatedclarity> @rubberfistfight it does feel like that huh, (if you die everyone you know gets dragon cancer)

[6:06:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can cure NPCs, it's not a death sentence.
[6:06:52] <KaseKaizer> fight in the shade
[6:06:56] <%RubberFistFight> @Wintermute_VRC having played and beaten all 3 souls games AND bloodborne, I completely disagree.
[6:06:56] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 I feel that with our personal data and cookies being gathered, traded, and sold, we're (read: I) entitled to ads that are relevant to me. Like id rather watch a mandatory minute ad about something I like or would buy, that a 5 second skip one with terry crews saying I should buy razors that won't nick my sack. I don't want to hear this Terry, I don't shave, I pluck! Am I crazy or should we be entitled to better (if more predatory) ads?
[6:06:57] <etalmeta> I mean, you have to die hundreds of times to reach that far and you can get stuff to stop that...
[6:07:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Difficulty has always been part of his MO. I don’t think it’s a bad thing to make a difficult game
[6:07:04] <+Wintermute_VRC> none of the npcs die, try playing the game because you talk shit about something you don't know
[6:07:07] <%superc37> @rubberfistfight NPCs cannot die from dragonrot. that much is known for sure.
[6:07:15] <%RubberFistFight> the only game that comes close is DS2 because the "hollowing" mechanic is a bit mean, but you can get around that.
[6:07:19] <SnaKemuho> I don't think NPCs can die, they just get their quests temporarily disabled
[6:07:23] <+Wintermute_VRC> You sound like an idiot complaining about nothing
[6:07:29] <%superc37> yeah dude
[6:07:29] <SpaceGuntank> PARRYING BULLETS!?
[6:07:30] <+Tennochief> now this is a fight
[6:07:38] <%Rakenshin> PogChamp
[6:07:44] <KungFuStarfish> Bk, what i miss?
[6:07:47] <%lewdskeletor13> You can parry ANYTHING if you try hard enough
[6:07:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When an NPC gets dragonrot all that happens is they stay sick until you cure the rot. And you have to die a lot for that to become necessary.
[6:07:55] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYE
[6:07:56] <complicatedclarity> punch gran in the dick pat!

[6:08:08] <%king_wragles> Oh hey, Pat's fighting the Gun Clan again
[6:08:09] <complicatedclarity> zoneHype
[6:08:18] <+zetaplus> the only thing dragonrot does is disable their quests until you cure them with an item you can buy it's not even a big deal.
[6:08:23] <%king_wragles> THAT'S SO COOL
[6:08:25] <%Konquerer> what's with this game and beating on old ladies
[6:08:26] <tyrano_the_wise> wow
[6:08:32] <%RubberFistFight> @Wintermute_VRC and you sound like a narrowminded twat whose opinion I don't give a shit about. Funny how that works.

[6:10:53] <SnaKemuho> @vitamind__ world building and exploring is on par with DS, gameplay is a little different
[6:10:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @vitamind__ It’s got some similar ideas but combat and mobility are radically different. Also you have a voiced protagonist and linear-ish story
