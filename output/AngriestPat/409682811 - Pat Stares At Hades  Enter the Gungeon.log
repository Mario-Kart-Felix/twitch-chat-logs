[0:05:00] <%mastertwin2> I think they decided that Bayo was too good for them too LP

[0:16:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 It's a real shame that a video game will never be able to capture what makes Mage so great, the improvisational magic. You're doing stuff like "Oh no, I'm on camera. But I have Forces 2, Correspondence 2 and Mind 4. Can I trace back the electrical signal, fry the hard drives, and memory wipe anyone watching the video feed?" And the Storyteller is like "It'll be difficulty 9, but yeah, fucking go for it!"
[0:16:08] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars To be fair, what else is he supposed to do in Ohio?
[0:16:11] <+HelveticaScenario> Please give him a big hug and a smooch, Pat

[0:30:11] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[0:30:12] <AttentionPelican> How many times does Pat have to bring up da Goblins when it comes to why he's weird about shit
[0:30:12] <+FloorBurger> Peach, get him to show feet.
[0:30:12] <+HellfireComms> tbh if you're streaming from home/self employed pj's are just your work clothes
[0:30:13] <Ipsenscastle> That's a terrible song
[0:30:14] <Gutsandlove> THEY are
[0:30:15] <starotter70> Oh Yeah?
[0:30:15] <%Dr00_PhD> ???

[0:30:16] <DracaenaLeaf> Did Paige steal any pajamas on the way to Japan??
[0:30:16] <deity_majora> Wait if Peach isn't there anymore... That means pat has to laundry even less since he will have double the PJs
[0:30:16] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> THEY ARE THOUGH. I am wearing some right now!
[0:30:18] <roflwaffleauthoritah> whats on pats shirt?
[0:30:18] <Alseid> Let's all leave so Pat's nerves can calm down
[0:30:19] <Plague_bagel> stroke at risk
[0:30:19] <%spiritofmojave> HE LOST IT
[0:30:20] <+UrielCobalt> Pat,Tencent does not own stock in Warframe, you said that kneejerk claim on the podcast this week, to for some reason defend them Tencent. Also, along with Epic, EA and Ubi are not seen as very upstanding, non greedy companies these days, so them having any relationship with Tencent is not a very ringing endorsement for going along with them.
[0:30:21] <suikudo> If you dont wear pj's in your own home i dont fucking trust you
[0:30:22] <@PeachSaliva> I hate this song
[0:30:22] <+cafefunk> But Pat, we’re all just little bitches, this is your show, just gotta realize U DA MAN
[0:30:23] <+Anonymasque> I wish I had the stones to wear PJ pants. I keep crotch blasting my normie pants.

[1:08:28] <%these_pockets> @Jpdodds I like every run to be luck, skill and making the best of a worst situation. It's why I like Isaac and Gungeon. You unlock more items, but it just adds to the RNG and goals. Don't like stats. I am very picky. Rogue Legacy is an exception because that's the gimmick

[1:20:00] <krymzen5> oh weiiird
[1:20:00] <%AzureGale> Free distribution is always nice
[1:20:02] <+Grayhammatter> ok... i guess
[1:20:03] <%BlackMage66652> Truly the most optimal of builds
[1:20:04] <Aussie_Manny> NOTHING is great
[1:20:08] <%joylent_blue> thats neat
[1:20:11] <+drakthebest> Pat is literally never going to get his second dash
[1:20:11] <%nmaten> but why though
[1:20:12] <Run44forrest> suboptimal
[1:20:12] <%Hasmeister96> OK I'm on the Twitch App, and the stream is still a black screen. I've tried closing the app and opening it again, but situation doesn't improve. gonna try a forced stop now
[1:20:12] <%StEmlosWater> @these_pockets So it looks like you can play without upgrades
[1:20:17] <Pykeball> What if you need the money later tho.
[1:20:17] <+Personified134> pat thats not how that shit works
[1:20:21] <%Kataguro> Fill these Pocketssssssss

[1:20:28] <$Sayie> This hurts me
[1:20:30] <+HeadsHeldHigh> trading pockets for thicc
[1:20:32] <T_Sasquatch> that makes no sense LUL
[1:20:35] <%strugglepunk2> Triple dash is the best thing in the game

[1:20:38] <krymzen5> thats a big net loss

[1:23:49] <aeonicvector> Its good shit, its supergiant
[1:23:50] <+mercilust> is this out of early access?
[1:23:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> The wrold is revolving

[1:23:58] <Run44forrest> dumbas
[1:23:59] <$waltzqueen> Athena: stop destroying my shit!
[1:23:59] <%Toynota10> This like Diablo?
[1:24:07] <+WonderLandGhost> The game looks good, definitely will look to pick it up when it launches on Steam.
[1:24:11] <%BlackMage66652> @AngriestPat Is it worth the risk of getting your credit card stolen by the Chinese?
[1:24:12] <%TheKillerKalamari> looks like a diablo type game
[1:24:18] <%konekoryugamine> Kind of
[1:24:18] <krymzen5> i love the protags animations
[1:24:22] <Pykeball> That bow really looks like it feels like Bastion's Breaker's Bow
[1:24:24] <%templar010> Fair enough
[1:24:27] <%SrG00SE> yeah i like whats going on here
[1:24:33] <+코코꾸라> @AngriestPat Is the music as good as Bastion and Transistor were?
[1:24:34] <M4eta> !uptime
[1:24:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m.
[1:24:36] <%konekoryugamine> It has Persona S-Links, a Diablo style and setting, and yet it's a run and gun
[1:24:37] <+Deano8817> so does this got plot like transistor and bastion? or is it more rogue like with less plot?
[1:24:40] <%Trinity5> this some good supergiant right here
[1:24:50] <rufus2k2> I wonder if the MC will get different costumes or would that break the art director's hands?
[1:24:53] <%konekoryugamine> So . . . IT'S TOKYO MIRAGE
[1:24:54] <%Toynota10> Genres don't exist anymore
[1:24:58] <+Grayhammatter> uh.. whoa
[1:25:00] <%BlackMage66652> THICCNESS ATTACK

[1:25:15] <$nademonkey1100> yea id dick her down
[1:25:15] <%SrG00SE> i thott you could use this
[1:25:20] <LeaIsChill> TRIPLE SHOT
[1:25:25] <lloyddboy> PIERCE
[1:25:27] <jubejube56> triple shot
[1:25:27] <krymzen5> triple
[1:25:28] <jordantheinternsm> armor
[1:25:28] <%nmaten> triple shot we gauntlet now
[1:25:30] <$MajorCrasher> Man I can't wait for 10 years from now when someone else opens another pc game store and people are mad at it and are defending epic
[1:25:31] <LeaIsChill> Triple Shot is honestly the best
[1:25:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> I would have as well
[1:25:37] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 don't get eliminated. Sounds a bit like fate right? But it actually kinda ends up more like Zatch bell. Which I guess is a better Fate? Because the god's mortal forms are decided by an email quiz Zeus forces past people's spam filters, we get cool designs like hephaestus having bestial bear traits, hades being a smol purple boy with a tv hammer, and persephone having a "Día de Muertos" look. And eris gets this crazy eye motif going on. And the crazy part is quite literal.
[1:25:51] <$eisigerr> sbfpSetIn
[1:25:53] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit
[1:25:54] <%SrG00SE> welp. theres the kirby we know and love
[1:25:57] <Run44forrest> what the fuck
[1:26:00] <LeaIsChill> Bosses don't usually have armour though right?
[1:26:01] <%BlackMage66652> @MajorCrasher A little optimistic it'll last that long, eh?
[1:26:01] <%Hammerknife> wait this is from the same people as bastion/transistor
[1:26:02] <%Solidnick18> kirby why
[1:26:03] <%TheKillerKalamari> do you want to publish that book you just wrote?
[1:26:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[1:26:08] <%sleepwalk1221> apatDab
[1:26:08] <krymzen5> jeez
[1:26:09] <%spiritofmojave> I thought you said you were chill tonight sbfpSetIn

[1:26:25] <%Remery_> The best bow style
[1:26:26] <benjiFG> that song was hot
[1:26:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SHOTGUN STRATS
[1:26:28] <%Hammerknife> man they keep making the same-ish game
[1:26:29] <T_Sasquatch> yea pat, close range bow
[1:26:30] <AttentionPelican> This game looks sick
[1:26:34] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Hades finally released on steam?
[1:26:35] <%konekoryugamine> Wait, KIrby has a stand?
[1:26:39] <%Albadabar> Everyone knows bows are most effective at close range
[1:26:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> @spiritofmojave shitty impulse control
[1:26:44] <%Kataguro> This sounds like Tool
[1:26:45] <DracaenaLeaf> not on steam yet
[1:26:49] <$waltzqueen> Artemis is best girl
[1:26:49] <vybben> Turns out 300% damage is fucking great!
[1:26:49] <$MajorCrasher> @BlackMage66652 oh it will, and then people will forget all this nonsense and feel really stupid but have leanred nothin
[1:26:50] <$Sayie> Did they make this boss easier? I remember him being actually hard on release
[1:26:51] <T_Sasquatch> @eldritchhorrortwitchchat nope
[1:26:51] <krymzen5> i def see what u mean by like diablo now
[1:27:06] <%AzureGale> Will this be the run?
[1:27:06] <%spiritofmojave> @Kirby_Sauce Well I'd be lying if I said I didn't get that
[1:27:12] <Parapattern> I LOVE YOU ARTEMIS
[1:27:17] <Pykeball> Also that dash is really just Red's dash. Damn, this really is every Supergiant game's best part melted into one.
[1:27:17] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Ah thought I’d ask just in case
[1:27:18] <%Laecerelius> All the godly ladies!
[1:27:19] <%SaltyDongs> I like her
[1:27:19] <%Solidnick18> oooo artemis

[1:27:22] <televisedrevolting> THAT'S A SOLID ARTIE
[1:27:23] <%spiritofmojave> YOYOYO huntress aesthetic
[1:27:23] <SixthSun2> Did pat already play gungeon or is that after hades?
[1:27:24] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@waltzqueen) (warning)
[1:27:27] <$Sayie> Them Thighs <3
[1:27:28] <+Personified134> TRIPLE RARE PogChamp
[1:27:29] <$GoogleyGareth> These characters are pretty great.
[1:27:30] <%Gogogolem> artemis is bae
[1:27:30] <%Hammerknife> @BlackMage66652 if epic game store forces valve to reduce its take, it's a win for everyone
[1:27:31] <%AncelDeLambert> The Virgin Artemis vs the Chad Aphrodite
[1:27:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DEADLY
[1:27:32] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh neat, they talk shit about each other
[1:27:32] <%Remery_> All the ladies
[1:27:35] <Turtleomertle> Wow do they all have different dialogue based on who you get?
[1:27:38] <$nademonkey1100> step on me preeze
[1:27:41] <%Dr00_PhD> Is that persephone
[1:27:43] <%TheGreatBamBe> Artemis is a virign lmao
[1:27:44] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Stack that CRIT
[1:27:45] <%Hammerknife> valve can't afford to keep having pc exclusives sniped
[1:27:46] <%SrG00SE> kirby's stand [AWESOME SAUCE] allows for the wielder to completely remove meaning from words
[1:27:48] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the joke
[1:27:52] <$waltzqueen> River of Flame is the best track istg
[1:27:53] <krymzen5> can you get crazy broken?
[1:27:53] <LeaIsChill> @Turtleomertle Yep! And synergies with the abilities
[1:27:57] <%TheKillerKalamari> does choosing a new upgrade replace the previous one?
[1:27:58] <%spiritofmojave> These character designs are the fucking good
[1:27:58] <+WonderLandGhost> The effects look really nice.
[1:27:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> Artemis embraces the power of being PURE
[1:28:00] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @GarbageNirvana Just like they would if they were real.

[1:37:51] <nobody12349> Aura

[1:37:52] <@commanderclaw> Passive buffs
[1:37:53] <pyookoomookoo> AURA AURA AURA
[1:37:53] <%weissguard> Charging STAR
[1:37:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> passive ablity
[1:37:55] <%spiritofmojave> 20% is pretty substantial
[1:37:57] <President_valentine> big damage
[1:37:57] <%skizzuto> aura seems best given how much damage you take
[1:37:57] <%SrG00SE> apatBig america
[1:37:57] <RoboXGP> a lot of greek gods are named after emperors from like 600b.c
[1:37:58] <%SaltyDongs> Defensive aura sounds like dragon ball z shit
[1:37:59] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat ALWAYS LESS DAMAGE
[1:37:59] <+Grayhammatter> uh... aura or mino rush?

[1:38:06] <Dovakhin573> SHIELD SLASH
[1:38:12] <$valriot> Man this game looks great and not remotely hindered by some ultimately irrelavant software to load it
[1:38:14] <$waltzqueen> Aura is too good to pass up
[1:38:15] <%Remery_> Keep your knockbac
[1:38:16] <%AzureGale> A lot of people look up to me. Now I'll show you why!
[1:38:17] <%SrG00SE> charging star!
[1:38:19] <+drakthebest> The bull rush charge speed buff is INCREDIBLY powerful
[1:38:21] <%Jetsfantasy> This looks super cool
[1:38:24] <simulationbard> 20% less damage is basically 20% more life
[1:38:25] <$nademonkey1100> FOR CHAOS
[1:38:27] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> "No one beneath the heavens would possess his talent for a millennia beyond his time" THAT'S FUKKEN DOPE

[1:40:11] <xxshadowxx416> mars
[1:40:11] <%Hammerknife> i'll be honest i didn't really like either bastion or transistor. this game doesn't seem like it would change that
[1:40:12] <+drakthebest> The only problem with wall slam is that it's useless against bosses and really hard to use in the second zone
[1:40:12] <mayorrev> ARES, DESTROY BRUCE!

[1:41:10] <SixthSun2> Impervious Blade Rift sounds friggin cool SwiftRage
[1:41:12] <%joylent_blue> Ares could step on me and i'd thank him
[1:41:14] <%ennui_on_me> Why is Greek mythology just the coolest mythology? Egyptian, Japanese, they're cool and all, but there's just a pure cool factor to Greek stuff.

[1:42:31] <Triplicat> I like how much faster you move compared to Bastion/Transistor
[1:42:31] <Run44forrest> whats this doom music
[1:42:37] <fmc009> the recovery on a dash feels oof
[1:42:38] <%AzureGale> This sounds like some doom music
[1:42:40] <Triplicat> even though all three characters were technically running
[1:42:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @captain_history yeah like that gone guy that just turns into a trout to avoid a god
[1:42:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Seems like you just need to keep your distance
[1:42:51] <Glide67> Is this the full game?
[1:42:53] <GurrenPrime> the shield really sucks
[1:42:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> Ah, mobile characters, this play style's ONE WEAKNESS
[1:43:04] <%manwithboxonhead> Early Access

[1:43:22] <+TawnyMonarch> Zagreus just pummeling nerds
[1:43:23] <%Hammerknife> there's something about this game that makes me think it was developed for mobile
[1:43:24] <LeaIsChill> WOAH
[1:43:26] <Parapattern> She's so fucking cute
[1:43:33] <+HelveticaScenario> g'night, Pat. Enjoy the game

[1:43:53] <+Grayhammatter> what the actual fuck
[1:43:56] <Zer0beats> Sparda shield?
[1:43:56] <king_Stug> artemis Kreygasm
[1:43:59] <%Cthulos> Absolutely Disgusting
[1:44:00] <$nademonkey1100> so who is youre waifu of this game @AngriestPat
[1:44:01] <%KaizenChaos> Gross that's strong
[1:44:02] <TheBlankAce> Roundtrip litterally upgraded to roundtrips
[1:44:10] <SiegeJay> Thousand Stabs! Round Trip! Rain Dance!
[1:44:12] <rufus2k2> @Hammerknife I think the strong art direction that makes it feel that way, the gameplay seems anything but though
[1:44:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oops all roundTrips
[1:44:35] <GurrenPrime> oh god if only it stacked
[1:44:36] <+ninjapenguin1414> @AngriestPat Pat, try using the charge attack with the shield you can attack cancel in it!
[1:44:58] <%AncelDeLambert> get hit, eat shit
[1:44:59] <%Cthulos> these round trips are missing the main aspect of round trip in that they don't come back
[1:45:01] <%GarbageNirvana> So does the Epic store take Paypal I wonder
[1:45:06] <%SrG00SE> if your roundtrips could deflect
[1:45:09] <+Grayhammatter> crazy talk
[1:45:13] <RadSuit> @Cthulos One Way Trip
[1:45:16] <LeaIsChill> An OP build isn't worth much in this game without a bunch of dodging from what I've seen
[1:45:18] <krymzen5> that combination feels like if played well it could break the game
[1:45:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Not sure I'm 100% comfortable using a card
[1:45:25] <NumberTooBig> drop your shield Kappa
[1:45:28] <%Tucker0603> ITS A FUCKING SHEILD PAT
[1:45:29] <President_valentine> I mean it's a shield
[1:45:29] <%Cthulos> @radsuit yup
[1:45:30] <GurrenPrime> wouldnt it be best to just stand behind the shield and spam your cast?
[1:45:34] <TigerClaws12> r-royal guard?
[1:45:35] <%Docblargle> "wow, no deflect on this" he says while holding a shield
[1:45:43] <DracaenaLeaf> gonna die
[1:45:44] <%AzureGale> A shield BLOCKS? Say it ain't so!
[1:45:45] <%Kataguro> Already ded
[1:45:52] <+spooky_cyborg> why make a sheild that doesnt do it sole function pat
[1:45:52] <%AncelDeLambert> HEEEEERE we are, born to be kings!
[1:45:54] <%Hasmeister96> OK I had to check who voices Zagreus, cos I thought it was the dude who voices Lotor in Voltron Legendary Defender
[1:45:57] <%Remery_> The cutie
[1:45:58] <LeaIsChill> WIDER
[1:45:58] <$waltzqueen> moortis prepared for you
[1:46:00] <GurrenPrime> oh man those are all good
[1:46:00] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat artie is better
[1:46:06] <%KaizenChaos> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:46:09] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[1:46:09] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 so, when they kept saying "meg" my brain went to that girl from Hercules, but when pat was in the bossfight, i pulled out my phone to get a look, and when I saw "the fury" on the title, I had a minor freak out. The level of danger they represent in one's mind does not decrease after reading the sandman comics. So when Zag is dodging, does he "zig"?
[1:46:12] <+cvp5127> TSUN
[1:46:12] <%Kataguro> Tsun
[1:46:15] <Zer0beats> Oh she BEEG jealous

[1:49:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazy
[1:49:44] <Parapattern> Artemis in this game really reminds me of Huntress Wizard from Adventure Time. Probably because Huntress Wizard was based on Artemis.

[1:56:58] <SixthSun2> You can't tell me that ain't just Dante
[1:57:00] <+JollyHeracross> ocean sojiro
[1:57:01] <DancePad_on_VHS> Reminder that Poseidon directly caused Medusa to become what she became by fucking her in Athena's temple
[1:57:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Seems in this game all or most of the gods are kind of cool instead of all being jerks.
[1:57:04] <Spookbarakus> BROSEIDON
[1:57:07] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Because she is NEKKID.
[1:57:07] <+superkeaton> Aphrodite is the best
[1:57:11] <%Kareem405> why do some of the voice actors sound so hushed?
[1:57:13] <$waltzqueen> Posiden is 2nd most responible god
[1:57:14] <+drakthebest> Athena and Zeus are easily the best
[1:57:14] <%Kataguro> But she thick
[1:57:16] <%spiritofmojave> Core assets thoo
[1:57:18] <%skizzuto> Charm seems really strong
[1:57:18] <MasterDecoder> Thank you @DancePad_on_VHS
[1:57:19] <+skylerpilot> fully embrace Broseidon Lord of the Brocean
[1:57:23] <ScrapSentinel> But you get hit all the time
[1:57:26] <shadowstep1998> @AngriestPat does the god relating to a weapon have a high chance of spawning if you equip that weapon ie artimis for bow or posideon for spear?
[1:57:29] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ClutchRoadagain) (warning)
[1:57:32] <CygnusRoboticus> I want to imagine the the cyclops is stuck on his island and every time he fails to swim away he wakes up on the shore where poseidon says "tough luck"
[1:57:33] <Hydrapissed> saftey net I bet that combos well with maybe vamp builds or something
[1:57:35] <%Deft_Thought> Wow, they updated the effects on Poseidon boons too
[1:57:37] <pectusumbra> I could see aphrodite with the shield defense arua
[1:57:38] <Kratok> @AngriestPat but if you weren't getting hit you would have won
[1:57:38] <+AhmCha> Last I remember, Dionysys and Zeus were the best boons
[1:57:41] <+ABadIdea> i should pick this game up next time it's on sale. I loved Transistor and I love greek myth
[1:57:48] <$Sayie> Yet you take the item that gives you an extra life ebcause you get hit literally all the time
[1:57:48] <%SrG00SE> omg the range
[1:57:54] <LeaIsChill> @AngriestPat There was a Gift button on Poseidon. Might wanna take a sec on the next God
[1:57:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Moobot) (warning)
[1:57:57] <yourliteraldog> Hephaestus is basement dweller who is an ugo
[1:57:58] <$waltzqueen> Diyonisis is Orpheic ofc his shit is the best
[1:58:07] <ShichiNoBushi> Do centaurs have one or two hearts?
[1:58:12] <%StEmlosWater> Thank the gods! *but not you, dad*
[1:58:22] <MasterDecoder> Hades > Poseidon
[1:58:22] <%Deft_Thought> @shadowstep1998 They seem to have a higher initial chance of spawning the first time you unlock that weapon but not in following runs
[1:58:23] <LeaIsChill> @AngriestPat There was a Gift button on Poseidon. Might wanna take a sec on the next God sfhSALUTE
[1:58:24] <xxshadowxx416> hades has one kid macaria

[1:59:08] <%Deft_Thought> Achilles has manly anime tiddy
[1:59:20] <Parapattern> Chad Aphrodite vs. Virgin Artemis

[2:00:56] <%SrG00SE> t h u n d e r t i m e
[2:01:02] <mayorrev> pizza time
[2:01:07] <CygnusRoboticus> The way these upgrades work is really binding of isaac-esque
[2:01:11] <%superc37> why is everyone in this game so goddamn HAWT
[2:01:21] <NumberTooBig> i see you... zap? or are we there after a few more buffs
[2:01:22] <%GarbageNirvana> So casting works like arrows do in Dead Cells, does it
[2:01:24] <$nademonkey1100> zeus looks at horse- imma fuck that
[2:01:27] <xxshadowxx416> zues is your dad
[2:01:30] <dekkitout> Though, Zeus has nothing on Genghis Khan
[2:01:30] <yourliteraldog> Rember that time kratos killed Greece
[2:01:30] <Ion_Laser> @superc37 cause Greece
[2:01:33] <%SrG00SE> oh fuck
[2:01:34] <wodinson95> @angriestpat First time tuning in live, postponing sleep before I must to wake up to that retail world. Keep doing you!
[2:01:37] <%SrG00SE> thats good
[2:01:38] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[2:01:40] <Dovakhin573> Oh shit
[2:01:41] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> I read that a Furry Jab.
[2:01:44] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> @superc37 Because it's a SuperGiant game and their characters are legally required to ooze charisma
[2:01:46] <ShichiNoBushi> For a second, I read that as "furry jab".
[2:01:49] <Aussie_Manny> ZERO TO HERO, in no time flat! ZERO TO HERO, just like that! kkenLUL
[2:01:50] <+AhmCha> This is the first time I've seen this game get over 30 views on Twitch, let alone 1000+
[2:01:52] <Hydrapissed> CRAZY
[2:01:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sisy lol
[2:01:53] <CygnusRoboticus> ! your past runs matters !
[2:01:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Furry Sister
[2:01:58] <titanvolt> They still haven't made art for sisyphus
[2:02:02] <ShichiNoBushi> How's Bouldy doing?
[2:02:04] <Smaenus> Get back to WORK Sisyphus
[2:02:08] <%spiritofmojave> So someone asked earlier, but do you fight Meg again or some other boss
[2:02:10] <$Sayie> @AhmCha Which is a damn shame because this game is amazing
[2:02:12] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @ShichiNoBushi Great minds, eh?
[2:02:15] <Finakala> Sisyphus is a perfect analogy for roguelikes
[2:02:15] <yourliteraldog> sissyfist
[2:02:20] <%Solidnick18> yo mate
[2:02:20] <%superc37> @ion_laser @unlimited_coffee_works y'know what you're both comepletely right
[2:02:24] <Daxalog> @AngriestPat How are you enjoying Transistor/Bastion Bloody Palace?
[2:02:25] <+cvp5127> do bosses respawn?
[2:02:27] <$Sayie> @spiritofmojave first boss is always meg, but with different dialogue
[2:02:29] <+Grayhammatter> that's ridiculous
[2:02:31] <%Deft_Thought> @AngriestPat Gold urns give you money. It's worth smashing most of the urns in an area for some quick cash
[2:02:31] <%Remery_> And hot girls
[2:02:33] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Haha Greece
[2:02:35] <moore595> THIS GAME LOOKS FUN

[2:02:41] <calamarvelous> Captain America javelin!!!
[2:02:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Probably the only reason these gods aren't all being assholes is because you're pretty much one of them.
[2:02:42] <%Solidnick18> woah
[2:02:43] <Zer0beats> Damn you Epic store
[2:02:43] <%flagi64> is my audio low or is it hard to hear voices?

[2:02:57] <CygnusRoboticus> Halfway up the hill Sisyphus gets an upgrade "Your boulder is 20% heavier or Your boulder rolls down 20% faster"
[2:02:58] <+AhmCha> @Sayie couldn't agree more, can't wait for the third biome to get released
[2:03:01] <+Robo_Wizard1> It's good that they seem to have captured that rogue like magic of broken seeming builds
[2:03:03] <titanvolt> is the sword any good
[2:03:07] <Hydrapissed> hawt
[2:03:10] <%superc37> dusa would also be a cutey if she wasn't just a head

[2:03:29] <+superkeaton> @superc37 I'm gonna have to fight you, man
[2:03:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Still not as cool as Roundtrip mania
[2:03:36] <ScrapSentinel> dusa is still cute even if she's just a head
[2:03:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sword seems a bit basic
[2:03:38] <NumberTooBig> ok that destroys projectiles, thats the best weapon i take it
[2:03:39] <%SrG00SE> it attac
[2:03:39] <%ShaneWhite> You sound so excited

[2:05:20] <televisedrevolting> Your the best, Uncle Ocean-Man!
[2:05:22] <+drakthebest> The boon selection in this game is like if the items in Isaac weren't bullshit RNG

[2:06:33] <%Solidnick18> it did a good burst of damage
[2:06:39] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat Those projectiles megara shoots out at you can be destroyed with attacks, she's actually very vulnerable to projectiles during that phase

[2:11:41] <wodinson95> @doc_ock_rokc That's very true lol
[2:11:49] <%Eclipse_knight_> always remember, zues married his sister who he raped
[2:11:58] <%Deft_Thought> Pat actually has a good build for the boss but not knowing how to fight it is gonna be a problem
[2:12:03] <%KaizenChaos> you could use armor shred my dude
[2:12:03] <%Eclipse_knight_> zeus
[2:12:15] <TheViltsuZ> @Keeble24 Chaos Rings 3, WitchSpring 3, Implosion, Monster Hunter Stories, Oddmar
[2:12:34] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat Don't take boss doors in this area, they're actually just not worth it because one is a mega gorgon that constantly petrifies you and another is a tiny area that gets filled with blue enemies that make all the other enemies invincible

[2:14:13] <+WonderLandGhost> which honestly I'm fine with
[2:14:26] <TheViltsuZ> @Keeble24 Also things like Oceanhorn, the Dragon Quest games, Final Fantasys, etc.
[2:14:37] <+WonderLandGhost> I keep getting into early access games and burning my self out quickly, before the full game is out. Like I have 60+ hours on risk of rain 2 atm...
[2:14:39] <+superkeaton> Blue enemies give them shields
[2:14:43] <NumberTooBig> still 2 areas, portraits, and new items are on their check list right
[2:14:47] <+drakthebest> @AngriestPat The blue crystal enemies make other enemies invincible

[2:44:05] <%Kataguro> @akingofnoobs Yes
[2:44:11] <+sparkjavelin> how many hours you put into gungeon?
[2:44:13] <+BoomerTiro> I remember the day that Patthew insisted he was Mattrick's best friend.

[2:45:08] <%PaladinDupre> \[T]/
[2:45:13] <+linSP> yay solitaire
[2:45:15] <+Cityscape17> rainbow mode? :(
[2:45:19] <+ABadIdea> hey Pat, play a Cursed run doodSprinkle
[2:45:22] <%AzureGale> #therun
[2:45:23] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat does solaire marine say "praise the gun!"?
[2:45:24] <startadevy> imGlitch
[2:45:28] <LegendaryDorkKnight> oh yeah
[2:45:31] <corrosivePaladin> Beastmode unlocks Bait Launcher
[2:45:33] <%Kataguro> Bait Launcher
[2:45:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> what is beast mode?
[2:45:36] <Finakala> But beating the Dragun gives baitluncher
[2:45:36] <krymzen5> wait
[2:45:38] <DancePad_on_VHS> Marine does the shoot
[2:45:39] <+NoKingArthur> Have you unlocked bullet?
[2:45:43] <krymzen5> how you get dif skins?
[2:45:43] <%Keeble24> YEYEYE Marine
[2:45:47] <ghostravens> i like the hunter a lot
[2:45:48] <mechslayer71> He’s super good
[2:45:49] <+linSP> actually robot's gun is the best starting gun
[2:45:51] <+TheShisno> Rainbow mode is hella fun
[2:45:51] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Best starting person is honestly the huntress, the crossbow is a good weapon all the way up to like floor 3
[2:45:52] <pyookoomookoo> the analog sticks on joy-cons went to shit and now i can't play gungeon anymore :(
[2:45:52] <reonome> I'm so garbage at gungeon :(
[2:45:54] <Abecale> You dont like the hunters bowgun?
[2:45:54] <corrosivePaladin> Beast Mode is nothing. Its a troll difficulty option. but it does unlock a gun
[2:45:56] <Dovakhin573> I preffer Hunter
[2:45:58] <benjiFG> @krymzen5 kill the past
[2:45:59] <%AzureGale> But the dog finds stuff >_>
[2:46:00] <flubber3d> hunter carries on first boss too
[2:46:02] <%ArcanumMBD> "Beast Mode is a setting that is found in the gameplay options. Turning on this mode does not affect gameplay in any way, but beating the game with the option on unlocks the Beast Master achievement. Unlocking this achievement unlocks the Bait Launcher gun."
[2:46:03] <%spiritofmojave> Marine has one of the best past's besides Bullet imo too
[2:46:03] <Monkeyweed21> it does nothing
[2:46:04] <%Keeble24> didn't you play Pilot a lot??
[2:46:07] <StaticSunrise> beastmode does literally nothing
[2:46:08] <+ABadIdea> my brother plays Hunter, he got REALLY good with the crossbow
[2:46:12] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Turning it on unlocks a gun once and nothing else
[2:46:12] <rufus2k2> I miss this game
[2:46:14] <%Kataguro> Pilot best, Spoiler is best-er
[2:46:15] <Saltmeisterr> yeah i feel that hunter is better
[2:46:23] <$Pacohax> marine is definitely my favorite starter
[2:46:24] <flakari> get junk friend
[2:46:25] <efratzy> not the dragun that unlocks with beast mode
[2:46:25] <%daisyyyy> I like the convicts starter pistol a lot
[2:46:26] <sir_nack> hunter is very good
[2:46:26] <%Dr_DangerPhD> The passive with the dog is really good as well
[2:46:28] <%ennui_on_me> Marine is who I've played as in the dozens of times I've tried and I still can't beat any bosses... I need to practice more ;_;
[2:46:33] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I like Hunter
[2:46:36] <DavidSanChan> perfect playthrough ruined
[2:46:38] <Finakala> Hunter best girl
[2:46:41] <Pykeball> Apparently Beast Mode has zero effect on gameplay and is just a parody of games that use that naming convention for harder difficulties. LUL
[2:46:45] <+TheShisno> crossbow and a random item pupper that you can pet, pretty baller
[2:46:46] <eagerdigger> yeah i have to use a lot of aim assist on switch cause the joycons are fucked
[2:46:47] <%AzureGale> #worthit
[2:46:50] <%akingofnoobs> blue sucks
[2:46:54] <corrosivePaladin> Ohgod the screen movement. Pat what is this fresh hell
[2:46:54] <startadevy> triglav?
[2:46:54] <%ArcanumMBD> Hunter is great cause crossbow one shots everything on the first floor
[2:46:58] <%Kataguro> Oh wait, turbo is off. This looks like molasses
[2:47:04] <+TheShisno> Convict is actually the worst though
[2:47:11] <%Albadabar> Years of TF2 has taught me that
[2:47:20] <+Tetraporc> I feel like Ron Swanson in that scene where he goes to the Home Depot
[2:47:23] <Saltmeisterr> right now im at the hollow cuz i fucked up getting the gunpowder
[2:47:27] <Finakala> I died on the Lich on Turbo the other day
[2:47:30] <flubber3d> no crosshair>
[2:47:31] <%Kataguro> It does, but it makes you better
[2:47:35] <%spiritofmojave> ^
[2:47:40] <Finakala> Maybe it would've been a won run without it
[2:47:42] <talisign> I like convicts starting shotgun. Other than that, trash
[2:47:42] <Mr_Strut> So don't lose
[2:47:43] <corrosivePaladin> Turbo does in fact make the game harder and youll frequently get hit due to unfair moves
[2:47:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> My cpu is dying, so I'm out. Gonna build some lego pokemon while I purge the white castle i had a few days ago from my body.
[2:47:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> wwhat IS turbo?
[2:47:53] <%Keeble24> this reminds me so much of Nuclear Throne
[2:47:54] <flubber3d> ah
[2:48:00] <krymzen5> you can turn one on in options
[2:48:00] <OkamiDude15> you can turn it on if you want though
[2:48:03] <Finakala> Turbo made does what it says, makes everything FAST
[2:48:04] <%joylent_blue> turbo makes the game faster i assume
[2:48:08] <ketchuo13> Does the game a soft lock on for controller?
[2:48:11] <+TheShisno> Turbo is fast mode, easier to get hit by shit
[2:48:13] <KaldorDraig0> Turbos super hard, but you need to beat the dragon with it to unlock an item
[2:48:14] <mleebee> Are those walking bullets?
[2:48:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> Turbo makes snails race
[2:48:22] <+TheShisno> Yes
[2:48:23] <Pykeball> I'd say this is the marijuana to Nuclear Throne's cocaine.
[2:48:28] <+linSP> but not turbo is so boring
[2:48:29] <OkamiDude15> @mleebee yeah what about it
[2:48:31] <startadevy> GO PAT
[2:48:33] <Finakala> There's an NPC added in the last expansion which allows you to turn it off/on
[2:48:36] <+Grayhammatter> you fool
[2:48:36] <%Kataguro> Normal is a slam dunk
[2:48:38] <+TheShisno> Those are the Bullet Kin
[2:48:42] <mleebee> They’re so cute
[2:48:45] <Finakala> Gives an achievement and an item if I recall
[2:48:47] <%joylent_blue> It's like Turbo in DMC, once you go Turbo you can't go back
[2:48:48] <%SrG00SE> look over here in the chat, we have big tiddies
[2:48:51] <+TheShisno> part of the Gundead
[2:48:53] <foreverN2dust> Pat's not looking, start raffling.
[2:48:56] <startadevy> fuckin up
[2:49:02] <SubjectX07x> @joylent_blue I literally can not stand playing non-turbo anymore.
[2:49:03] <+combomaniadeluxe> WHAT
[2:49:04] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat is to parody games that add a new mode "as a term for a high difficulty experience." also parodies games that give you an unlock for beating a game with X setting on.
[2:49:04] <%AzureGale> Fucking rooms are the best kind of rooms
[2:49:05] <OkamiDude15> sfhPOINT woopsB we got butts in chat
[2:49:07] <sir_nack> i think gungeon has my favorite aesthetic among the popular roguelites
[2:49:12] <+ChestMimik> You can roll into the smallest slimes to kill them
[2:49:14] <benjiFG> It also gives you a little invincibility
[2:49:17] <+TheShisno> Table i-frames
[2:49:17] <%duneblythe> oh no, elmo. stop.
[2:49:17] <SunsetJack> You also have invul from bullets too
[2:49:19] <%Dr00_PhD> Cadence of Hyrule really makes me want Samus in this game
[2:49:20] <rufus2k2> you can also roll through the smallest slimes
[2:49:26] <+Retrash> Tables also make you invincible for like a second after flipping it. You can literally walk into bullets @AngriestPat
[2:49:26] <$spardanwarrior> IIRC flipping tables also gives you iframes
[2:49:27] <%ECRead> butts doodLewd
[2:49:31] <+Grayhammatter> i love it
[2:49:32] <foreverN2dust> @OkamiDude15 snowso1ElfWUT snowso1Back
[2:49:33] <%daisyyyy> I cant stop playing gungeon
[2:49:34] <DancePad_on_VHS> 2d6 - 3
[2:49:34] <%Kataguro> Flame Hand god
[2:49:39] <%Keeble24> gonn be lots of fisting tonight
[2:49:40] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Flame Hand + Fat Bullets can carry you through an entire run
[2:49:41] <+TheShisno> 2D6+ Int Mod, good reference
[2:49:41] <Monkeyweed21> damage good
[2:49:42] <+ChestMimik> Technically you can roll into anything to deal damage, actually
[2:49:42] <%Order_of_Mystery> and flipping a table gives you a frame of invunerability @angriestpat

[2:49:49] <%Kataguro> Buy Keys
[2:49:53] <@JustinianKnight> also hello
[2:49:55] <%MattDemers> CONSUMABLE
[2:49:56] <%spiritofmojave> Last one is pretty busted if you get a +1 bullet synergy
[2:49:56] <ketchuo13> Gun friendship is a use item that Boost firerate, damage, reload speed, and knockback
[2:49:57] <%skizzuto> gun friendship is good
[2:49:58] <+Grayhammatter> +1 to gun
[2:49:59] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat rapid fire i believe
[2:49:59] <%Kataguro> 2 Keys in shop
[2:50:01] <Run44forrest> isaac should have this
[2:50:01] <+djinnJuice> consumableeeeeeee
[2:50:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CONSUMABLE
[2:50:08] <%akingofnoobs> hell ye I love that dnd shit
[2:50:09] <DancePad_on_VHS> Pat once again loses to a consumable
[2:50:09] <reonome> its reusable you nitwits
[2:50:12] <+combomaniadeluxe> can't mega doser get you into the sewer floor?
[2:50:27] <@JustinianKnight> its an active
[2:50:27] <talisign> Mega doser can get you a lot
[2:50:29] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @AngriestPat if you get an extra key get the mega douser to go to secret floor through fireplace
[2:50:31] <+TheShisno> Also for all of you playing Gungeon, BOOKMARK THE GUNGEON WIKI. Seriously, it has everything you need and is official
[2:50:31] <$CarlosEoM> but it is temp buff which pat also hates
[2:50:32] <$spardanwarrior> It recharges
[2:50:33] <sirrice77> @combomaniadeluxe yes in case you break the water barrel for the fireplac
[2:50:34] <Finakala> A few are to be fair
[2:50:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> as much as I like this game, I suck at it rally bad and can't unlock shit
[2:50:38] <%Kataguro> Actives is the term
[2:50:39] <DancePad_on_VHS> Just makes it an infinite consumable then
[2:50:42] <DavidSanChan> to unlock the seeecret grate
[2:50:42] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat Gun Friendship is just a straight up DPS increase. and it charges REALLY fast
[2:50:50] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat While active, increases damage by 30%, doubles fire rate, decreases reload times by 70%, and multiplies knockback by 10.
[2:50:51] <corrosivePaladin> I guess pat doesnt do secret floors?
[2:50:53] <@JustinianKnight> gunknight
[2:50:56] <%skizzuto> you don't need mega douser to get to sewers, there's a water barrel in the room

[2:51:06] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat Think we'll ever see co-op gungeon on stream?

[2:52:42] <r_Foeburden87> what have i been doing....
[2:52:44] <reonome> he got hit
[2:52:45] <rufus2k2> @Bane_Kaikyo if you no hit the boss you get an extra heart
[2:52:45] <DraxTD> wait I lost the thread.. why is @AngriestPat mad at that boss?
[2:52:48] <startadevy> bitch on freeze
[2:52:49] <+Grayhammatter> fucking what....
[2:52:49] <%joylent_blue> fucking green shells
[2:52:49] <sirrice77> @Bane_Kaikyo you get a bonus heart for not getting hit
[2:52:51] <StaticSunrise> @Bane_Kaikyo you get a health upgrade if the boss doesn't hit you
[2:52:54] <%TheTakkster> @Bane_Kaikyo If you kill the boss without being hit, you get a heart container
[2:52:54] <mayorrev> mario gun
[2:52:55] <%Albadabar> Oh wow
[2:52:57] <+ChestMimik> @Bane_Kaikyo You get an item for perfecting the boss that gives you bonus health
[2:52:57] <%AzureGale> @Bane_Kaikyo Missed out on a heart container master round
[2:52:58] <%Verd_254> oh, it's a mario gun
[2:53:00] <%skizzuto> @DraxTD he got hit by it
[2:53:00] <+Qsmash_> fucking sonic the hedgehog gun
[2:53:00] <+Voidwyvern> @Bane_Kaikyo if you perfect a boss you get an item that gives an extra heart
[2:53:02] <%Docblargle> can you damage yourself with that?
[2:53:02] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit. LYL
[2:53:03] <VritraReiRei> @Bane_Kaikyo if you dont get hit during a boss fight, you get an item that gives you a heart container
[2:53:10] <OkamiDude15> @Docblargle doesnt look like it
[2:53:11] <DraxTD> @skizzuto ahh
[2:53:14] <%Kataguro> Gold casing made up for it
[2:53:16] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> wait did pat fail at pillar gatling gull?
[2:53:20] <%Bane_Kaikyo> oh is that how that works? deyum
[2:53:22] <%AzureGale> MARIO KART
[2:53:26] <%Kataguro> @owo_uwu_owo_my_dude King
[2:53:27] <%Hammerknife> no, it was king
[2:53:28] <+Voidwyvern> the lead throne boss
[2:53:29] <coreybom> @qsmash_ SONIC?
[2:53:29] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, that's a pretty cool gun
[2:53:33] <talisign> I don't think you can damage yourself with any guns
[2:53:35] <DavidSanChan> big table slide plz
[2:53:37] <SixthSun2> IF only they were red shells too
[2:53:37] <%AncelDeLambert> so many dead turtles....
[2:53:42] <Pykeball> I love how Gungeon gives zero shits and has blatant things like these.
[2:53:43] <Nina96> thats really strong
[2:53:46] <%Hammerknife> the only gun you can damage yourself with is a gun that lays fire and you jump on the fire
[2:53:47] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> @angriestpat Thoughts on Casey?
[2:53:49] <Zuthus> What if the bouncing shells did damage to you as well LUL
[2:53:53] <%AzureGale> Is there a synergy to make them blue shells
[2:53:54] <Run44forrest> pat doesnt play with the cursor on?
[2:53:55] <%Hammerknife> snowballer is awful
[2:53:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[2:53:59] <@JustinianKnight> garbage gun
[2:54:00] <%SrG00SE> lewd
[2:54:00] <%spiritofmojave> it's not worth buying
[2:54:03] <flubber3d> KEY
[2:54:05] <Finakala> It's alright but not worth cash
[2:54:06] <+ABadIdea> has pat not learned how to flip table yet =U
[2:54:07] <sir_nack> @Run44forrest cursor doesnt appear when using controller
[2:54:10] <televisedrevolting> FUCK THESE THINGS
[2:54:10] <%Kataguro> Snowballer is good with synergies
[2:54:11] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat have you fought the Rat yet?
[2:54:11] <$CarlosEoM> big key
[2:54:13] <talisign> Lead Maidens are such crap
[2:54:18] <benjiFG> thonk
[2:54:18] <Finakala> Lead Maidens a SHIT
[2:54:19] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> @angriestpat snowballer is gud 4 freeze but nothing else
[2:54:21] <DancePad_on_VHS> This gun + scatter shot + fat bullets + flak bullets
[2:54:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 What's the best combo you've gotten? I once had the Bullet and the Shell (which has dual wield synergy), remote-controlled bullets, shock rounds, and rubber bullets. Unstoppable swirling vortex of pistols and shotguns spraying bullets everywhere, all chained with lightning, going wherever I want.
[2:54:32] <eagerdigger> man i suck at this game too
[2:54:37] <startadevy> SeriousSloth
[2:54:37] <eagerdigger> nearly died to gull
[2:54:42] <Run44forrest> @sir_nack isnt there an option for it settings?
[2:54:45] <ameraaaaaa> gun
[2:54:48] <Finakala> Gull is honestly pretty tough for a first boss
[2:54:49] <%spiritofmojave> Anyone ever roll Gunther at the later levels in this, he's the fucking best
[2:54:49] <%Kataguro> Rip Helmt
[2:54:51] <%Hammerknife> tbh most of the gun combos in this game are overrated
[2:54:51] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:54:52] <%SrG00SE> this is warmpup
[2:54:54] <+combomaniadeluxe> you got it pat
[2:54:58] <%crimsonharvest> this is just stream tax
[2:54:58] <Finakala> Also fuck Ammoconda
[2:55:02] <lionmanguy> This is as good as an average run for me so
[2:55:03] <%Hammerknife> void marshal is the best not-S gun in the game
[2:55:08] <ameraaaaaa> what weapons do you have
[2:55:10] <eagerdigger> I just cant fucking into dodge roll
[2:55:12] <@JustinianKnight> Ammoconda sucks
[2:55:12] <+eagleclassgamer> @AngriestPat I didn't watch the newest podcast Did you and Woolie talk about cheating in Sekiro
[2:55:13] <CassidyAlacrity> wow never seen that room before
[2:55:16] <%Kataguro> I got Gunther on floor 1 as New Spoiler. It made unlocking him easy as fuck
[2:55:16] <Finakala> Also Mineflayer is harder than all the stage 4 bosses
[2:55:17] <%AzureGale> Think of it this way - if you had no armor, you wouldn't be at full health right now
[2:55:18] <%joylent_blue> its ok, i know i'd suck at this too
[2:55:21] <a_mad_dragon> fraaaaaaame droooooops
[2:55:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:55:22] <Monkeyweed21> no
[2:55:24] <+cawi> ammoconda is annoying, and I have all the characters unlocked.
[2:55:24] <+seoultrain> LMAO
[2:55:24] <%crimsonharvest> i love how they've added what are essentially Vaults and Pits from Angband and that family of roguelike
[2:55:26] <%skizzuto> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatMenace
[2:55:27] <sir_nack> @Run44forrest oh yeah, i guess there is. not on by default tho
[2:55:27] <%Kataguro> apatCrazyhead
[2:55:30] <lloyddboy> CRAZY TALK
[2:55:32] <flubber3d> w00t
[2:55:32] <Mr_Strut> Just give up
[2:55:36] <Mr_Strut> like a hero
[2:55:36] <$spardanwarrior> Can always heal up in the shop
[2:55:38] <mayorrev> BIG BRAVE
[2:55:39] <Monkeyweed21> i've had worse wins
[2:55:40] <+FloorBurger> dont coward out. do it
[2:55:43] <startadevy> cmonBruh
[2:55:44] <%joylent_blue> only heroes give up
[2:55:47] <talisign> We all believe in you Patty B!
[2:55:47] <%Hammerknife> actually the best combo isn't even a gun - get the blademail armor that increases roll damage with Bullet
[2:55:47] <Dral54> Just remember, quitters always win!
[2:55:50] <@JustinianKnight> just keep going
[2:55:50] <%AzureGale> Pat is NOT a quitter
[2:55:52] <energywarning> not gonna save up for the rat key?
[2:55:54] <%GarbageNirvana> @GeneralSCPatton I got remote control bullets with the crown of guns once
[2:55:55] <%spiritofmojave> this run's still salvageable, you got it
[2:56:00] <%Hammerknife> you never have to shoot your gun at any non-boss, you roll into everything and they all ide
[2:56:05] <%Tucker0603> i've literally never seen this game before, looks neet
[2:56:08] <DancePad_on_VHS> tfw 2nd floor boss Beholster is easier than every 1st floor boss in the game
[2:56:09] <%Tucker0603> neat*
[2:56:09] <+ABadIdea> i haven't ever seen pat flip a table on purpose. is there some kind of reason???
[2:56:10] <@JustinianKnight> not worth doing a rat run right now
[2:56:12] <%logoth_> are pits instant kill?
[2:56:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Imagine being able to throw a wall of lead at someone
[2:56:21] <@JustinianKnight> pits are 1 damage
[2:56:22] <+ChestMimik> @logoth_ Nah just damage
[2:56:22] <Ner234> @logoth_ No
[2:56:24] <%logoth_> Pat DOESNT want BLUE
[2:56:26] <sir_nack> @logoth_ one pip of damage
[2:56:29] <OkamiDude15> pits are half a heart
[2:56:30] <flakari> SHOOT IT FOR JUNK
[2:56:31] <+combomaniadeluxe> @logoth_ no just half a heart
[2:56:32] <%Kataguro> Blue can be really good
[2:56:33] <benjiFG> get cursed pat
[2:56:37] <Finakala> Vulcan Cannon + Admit One + COM4NDO is amazing
[2:56:37] <mar_krow> Shoot it
[2:56:38] <DavidSanChan> it's dark souls 2
[2:56:39] <%Kataguro> Scrambler comes from Blue
[2:56:40] <talisign> @DancePad_on_VHS What about the Gorgun?
[2:56:42] <%AzureGale> Pat's favorite color: NOT blue
[2:56:43] <%spiritofmojave> there's a 20% for a junk buddy who can be upgraded to something insanely good later on
[2:56:49] <%logoth_> Is there yellow? What about blue and yellow?
[2:56:51] <startadevy> super store for demons
[2:56:52] <%Hammerknife> blue chests are good if you have a spare key after killing the boss
[2:56:52] <%Jetsfantasy> Blue is better than green, iirc
[2:56:59] <+combomaniadeluxe> wait you can shoot the chests?
[2:56:59] <startadevy> DxCat
[2:57:02] <%Hammerknife> no, blue is the worst
[2:57:02] <+sparkjavelin> blue chests might have Sir Junkan
[2:57:04] <DancePad_on_VHS> Gorgun can at least stop you from shooting
[2:57:05] <flubber3d> could even be better than junk
[2:57:06] <televisedrevolting> @jetsfantasy No
[2:57:14] <%joylent_blue> like likes D:
[2:57:14] <Finakala> Gorgun is so easy
[2:57:15] <%SrG00SE> vore'd
[2:57:18] <%Kataguro> All that ammo, gone
[2:57:21] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat still worth shooting every chest you dont plan to open
[2:57:22] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> 5%, according to the wiki
[2:57:24] <lloyddboy> VORE
[2:57:24] <flakari> Still tho
[2:57:24] <DavidSanChan> just get teh golden one ez
[2:57:24] <%spiritofmojave> damn, wondered why I never found him again
[2:57:24] <startadevy> i did it
[2:57:28] <VritraReiRei> @Jetsfantasy green on average is better than blue, and is rarer
[2:57:29] <%El_Desperad0> Sir Junkton is great
[2:57:31] <SunsetJack> After you beat the game with him no...?
[2:57:32] <flakari> Junk friend for life
[2:57:34] <mayorrev> I miss Junkan BibleThump
[2:57:38] <%Kataguro> Junkan comes out of Blue Chests
[2:57:38] <%AzureGale> I thought it was 5%. Still low though
[2:57:41] <%Kataguro> Blue is good
[2:57:44] <mayorrev> I haven't seen Junkan in months
[2:57:53] <Finakala> Junkan is pretty rare yeah
[2:57:54] <+lokiluko> can you get sir junky from non ranbow chests during a rainbow run? get like 8+ junks during those
[2:57:56] <%Jetsfantasy> Ah, I apatCrazy myself
[2:57:59] <mar_krow> Malkavien junk

[2:58:26] <%El_Desperad0> DON'T MISS
[2:58:28] <ketchuo13> If you hit something you get ammo back
[2:58:29] <rufus2k2> it's super powerful
[2:58:29] <%AncelDeLambert> saving that for the boss
[2:58:29] <%Kataguro> Don't Miss
[2:58:29] <sirrice77> thats so strong
[2:58:31] <DavidSanChan> watch for those mimics
[2:58:31] <Zuzu_Pachulia> replenishes ammo as you hit stuff
[2:58:32] <%Solidnick18> that named after drifter
[2:58:33] <benjiFG> it refills on hits
[2:58:33] <SubjectX07x> It regens bullets as long as you don't miss.
[2:58:34] <%AzureGale> Wonder what that is a reference to :p
[2:58:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Those slimes don't seem very bullet themed
[2:58:35] <%SrG00SE> guess how it shoots lmao
[2:58:36] <SunsetJack> Hype Light Drifter gun?
[2:58:38] <ThDark> Refills only on hits
[2:58:39] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat don't miss and you won't lose ammo
[2:58:39] <a_mad_dragon> recharges IF YOU HIT
[2:58:39] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat hit honfirms recharge 1 ammo
[2:58:40] <%Kataguro> When you hit!
[2:58:40] <SubjectX07x> If you miss you lose the round @AngriestPat
[2:58:42] <%SrG00SE> jackpot
[2:58:44] <@JustinianKnight> Refills on hits
[2:58:44] <%Jetsfantasy> That's really good

[2:58:54] <%Hammerknife> doesn't that gun refill ammo if you hit multiple things with it
[2:58:59] <%Hammerknife> its really good with flak bullets
[2:59:01] <$spardanwarrior> Refills on hit. Infinite ammo as long as you NEVER miss
[2:59:02] <%orenfel> Not really
[2:59:02] <ThDark> It can be
[2:59:03] <@JustinianKnight> no
[2:59:03] <$SleepyMaribo> weirdest gun i ever got was the giant shotgun shell that shot shotguns...
[2:59:03] <eagerdigger> Cave story guns are in this game i know for sure
[2:59:04] <Finakala> Not worth buying
[2:59:05] <%Hammerknife> no snowballer sucks
[2:59:05] <%GarbageNirvana> how much you got in the gnawed key
[2:59:05] <+faithless_zealot> It's ok
[2:59:05] <talisign> I would fuse the brink and flame
[2:59:05] <SubjectX07x> No.
[2:59:06] <sir_nack> it's okay, you can freeze guys
[2:59:06] <ketchuo13> It's okay
[2:59:07] <lloyddboy> eh
[2:59:07] <+ChestMimik> Not really
[2:59:08] <$spardanwarrior> Snowballer is meh
[2:59:08] <%El_Desperad0> Yes
[2:59:10] <benjiFG> good against common enemies since it freezes
[2:59:11] <%skizzuto> not worth buying
[2:59:11] <+keigatide> It's actual bottom tier.
[2:59:11] <%Cthulos> it's alright
[2:59:11] <%AzureGale> No! No snowballer!
[2:59:12] <%Kataguro> It's fine with synergies
[2:59:13] <+combomaniadeluxe> its alright
[2:59:14] <%duneblythe> meow
[2:59:14] <%StEmlosWater> I like it
[2:59:15] <flubber3d> it's okay
[2:59:17] <%Jetsfantasy> If you need frost for some reason
[2:59:20] <@JustinianKnight> it's garbo
[2:59:23] <%spiritofmojave> I mean the freeze effect is something you could find on any average gun
[2:59:25] <VritraReiRei> it's okay if you have another item to finish off frozen enemies
[2:59:26] <SubjectX07x> The hyper light blaster is strong but requires you to aim carefully because missing results in you losing the ammo.
[2:59:29] <rufus2k2> replenish health !
[2:59:29] <Dral54> Chest MURDERED
[2:59:31] <DavidSanChan> if you feel like spamming shoot to freeze stuff and like rolling into dudes to shatter them
[2:59:31] <reonome> GET HEALTH

[2:59:33] <Saltmeisterr> Its just the gun grom hyper light
[2:59:34] <SubjectX07x> It's great for bosses.
[2:59:34] <%Hammerknife> always worth getting junk - can sell to sell creep, can feed the garbage gun
[2:59:34] <@JustinianKnight> easiest one
[2:59:35] <ketchuo13> At least is isnt the snake
[2:59:37] <rufus2k2> why you like this

[3:01:16] <Quikanims> VOLA VOLA VOLA VOLA VOLARE VIA
[3:01:16] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Quikanims) (warning)

[3:01:26] <$nademonkey1100> the fuck is that machine next to the elevator
[3:01:31] <benjiFG> Paige would love this gun
[3:01:34] <+lokiluko> i'm a little sad,almost filled out the ammonomicon again already. Just need to find that new turtle item in game, but it's unlocked. That new zone was really underwhelming
[3:01:34] <+Grayhammatter> it's fine
[3:01:37] <CrimsonFox777> Is that Paige's favorite gun?
[3:01:39] <%Hammerknife> @nademonkey1100 if you're full on hearts it saves them
[3:01:45] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat has paige seen the skull gun
[3:01:48] <%Hammerknife> instead of having to port back to rooms to grab them at the end
[3:01:52] <+TheShisno> Channelers are bitches
[3:01:53] <%SrG00SE> its not her favorite gun but its her favorite something else
[3:01:58] <$nademonkey1100> ohhhhhh
[3:02:03] <+TopTieramisu> the worst is the one that turns enemies into jammed enemies
[3:02:07] <%spiritofmojave> the later one's that make cursed enemies are AWFUL
[3:02:10] <%Kataguro> I'm glad there's not a fat channeler
[3:02:14] <mayorrev> show her the skeleton gun
[3:02:17] <%Kataguro> Like there is fat Jammer
[3:02:17] <@JustinianKnight> Does Paige now you can play as a Skeleton?
[3:02:20] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:02:21] <anAngryHamster> Stream is all frozen for me
[3:02:22] <%AzureGale> The skelmo gun
[3:02:23] <Finakala> Fat Jammer is an asshole
[3:02:32] <Finakala> Luckily they're pretty rare
[3:02:35] <SoulEatha> the worst one is the jelly that explodes into bullets

[3:03:05] <Finakala> lowercase r + 1+Bullets is actually really strong
[3:03:06] <%Kataguro> Lowercase R needs a bullet mod to be good
[3:03:09] <Mr_Strut> Where the spice at?
[3:03:09] <+TheShisno> also r gun has a ton of synergies
[3:03:10] <VritraReiRei> Coolness is great with Potion of Gun Friendship

[3:17:07] <VritraReiRei> @a_mad_dragon the red ammo crates give 50% ammo to equipped gun and 25% to rest
[3:17:12] <$FlubbedPig> cheer500 Long time no see. Finals are happening, so here's an oldie but a goodie to pass the time. In regards to Policenauts' plot-point about using dead celebrity DNA to clone space hookers, which do you think is more fucked up? A) The scenario where they're vat-grown as adults and have actually only been alive for like 3 years? Or B) The scenario where they were birthed as babies and have lived a natural life being groomed since childhood for their inevitable hooking futures?

[3:22:27] <mayorrev> killed by the pillar men
[3:22:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> That boss is rough, without an explosive weapon its a tough time
[3:22:27] <startadevy> cohhMoney
[3:22:28] <Finakala> Me too pat, me too
[3:22:28] <Monkeyweed21> HOW
[3:22:29] <%rytyoung> @AngriestPat Hey Pat have you heard of an anime calle Dororo? Its on amazon prime and shares many of the same concepts as Sekiro like prosthetthe pillars suck
[3:22:29] <%AzureGale> You'll get 'em next time!
[3:22:30] <%Hammerknife> wait pat has robot unlocked but not bullet?
[3:22:32] <dickbuttwoman> You didn't stop taking hits, so I won't stop photoshopping your face onto sonic characters
[3:22:32] <%galaxyswirl> they are consumable items
[3:22:32] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> VBlanks?
[3:22:36] <%Kataguro> Still, good try
[3:22:38] <%docpepperphd> you did good tho
[3:22:43] <fluffypupperino> what system is he playing on
[3:22:45] <%PaladinDupre> Unlock the Gunslinger nerd
[3:22:47] <%SrG00SE> the real run starts now
[3:22:48] <DXLelouch24> do a rainbow run coward
[3:22:48] <mayorrev> Vorpals are insane
[3:22:50] <%ElenaManetta> I had that, too
[3:22:50] <talisign> Nice practice run
[3:22:52] <Finakala> Bullet is fun
[3:22:55] <%spiritofmojave> Bullet's great
[3:22:56] <+lokiluko> god it's so wierd not to see thousands of credits in the corner
[3:22:56] <%JayEarly> wait since when was Oscar in this game?
[3:23:04] <%ElenaManetta> And sometimes I accidentally killed The Bullet in a crowded room
[3:23:05] <SixthSun2> Controller DansGame
[3:23:15] <%Kataguro> You need barely anything for Robot, just patience and not rolling into elevators
[3:23:18] <$spardanwarrior> Had the same problem. Took me AGES to find those caped fucks
[3:23:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Are you gonna beat Olmec tonight? (That's Spelunky)
[3:23:37] <%ElenaManetta> Gungeon is way better on a controller
[3:23:39] <%JayEarly> In twin stick shooters controller or mouse makes no differnce
[3:23:42] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Honestly gungeon kinda plays better on controller
[3:23:44] <%AzureGale> Pat should take a job in lyrics writing
[3:23:49] <%Jetsfantasy> Gungeon plays like a twinstick shooter on controller. It's just correct that way
[3:23:53] <SixthSun2> R
[3:23:55] <+NoKingArthur> I prefer gungeon on controller as well
[3:23:58] <%MegboyManuel> it's called a twin STICK shooter
[3:24:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Look at dem guns
[3:24:00] <+Ell1ot> Pat!
[3:24:01] <benjiFG> when's the casey-only run?
[3:24:02] <foreverN2dust> good start LUL
[3:24:06] <JanusII> Ginger ginxed.
[3:24:07] <VritraReiRei> CRAZY TALK Jebaited
[3:24:09] <natebud> T-Shirt Cannon DansGame
[3:24:18] <mayorrev> GET YA T SHIRTS HERE
[3:24:21] <silverira> kurazy talku
[3:24:23] <%Kataguro> Key means worth
[3:24:24] <%ElenaManetta> The nice thing about Gungeon is that playing your normal file for streams is A-OK since you ain't ruining shit
[3:24:26] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Nuclear Throne plays better with KB/M tho funnily enough
[3:24:27] <%TheTakkster> Is the t shirt cannon good/
[3:24:30] <%MyDarkStorm> Pat Stop taking damage
[3:24:37] <natebud> unless you're near a pit
[3:24:39] <+TheShisno> time to download Mod the Gungeon to get those Casey only runs
[3:24:41] <%Hammerknife> t shirt cannon is crap
[3:24:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> T-shirt cannon: +1 dmg vs Housewives
[3:24:50] <%JayEarly> Each shirt you buy will not stop Woolie from stealing pies
[3:24:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> But you get Tshirts
[3:24:57] <%JayEarly> only god and anime have such powser
[3:24:58] <%Hammerknife> for the marine his starting gun is better than almost every D rank gun and most C rank guns
[3:25:00] <%Kataguro> T-Shirt Cannon is fine for 1, O, and 2
[3:25:02] <Alseid> Oh so Pat doesn't like the BROWNS huh
[3:25:02] <+TheShisno> Hey one of those could be a Casey
[3:25:08] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Shoot the brown chests, you might find the Junkiest Boy
[3:25:09] <efratzy> always open browns
[3:25:14] <+faithless_zealot> cmonBruh
[3:25:20] <%joylent_blue> every T shirt you buy makes Pat grow in SIZE and ANGER
[3:25:21] <benjiFG> but that 100 damage
[3:25:21] <natebud> Other one should be an item at least
[3:25:26] <%El_Desperad0> Casey is top tier
[3:25:32] <+Retrash> But Sling though
[3:25:33] <%Kataguro> Casey is a run destroyer
[3:25:34] <%NobleJedi> @rumtumtugnutz with a "no footlongs" buff
[3:25:36] <CrimsonFox777> D:
[3:25:37] <+Classy_Bulb> *Not liking casey* LUL
[3:25:38] <%Kataguro> In the best way possible
[3:25:39] <+ChestMimik> Feed the Junk
[3:25:41] <%logoth_> sbfpSnip sbfpSnip sbfpSnip sbfpSnip
[3:25:42] <+TheShisno> D:
[3:25:43] <%joylent_blue> D:
[3:25:43] <%spiritofmojave> D:
[3:25:43] <+LoganWulfric> Ooooo you tell that box
[3:25:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow rude
[3:25:47] <%SrG00SE> Casey licks cheese off the floor?
[3:25:49] <Monkeyweed21> cuz you a bitch
[3:25:53] <%deviljhojho94> D:
[3:25:54] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@BoomerTiro) (warning)
[3:25:57] <%ElenaManetta> It takes a bit to get used to, but once you do, it's the most overpowered weapon in the game
[3:25:57] <+Retrash> The high tier Gungeon meta now is that brown chests are better than blue and greens
[3:25:59] <+faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat Are you gonna do the bonus levels?
[3:26:04] <mayorrev> Casey's for people with too much time on their hands
[3:26:06] <%AzureGale> PJSalt
[3:26:06] <%El_Desperad0> @Retrash with alpha and omega bullets Kreygasm
[3:26:06] <mayorrev> dont @ me
[3:26:08] <Zuzu_Pachulia> buy the key tho
[3:26:10] <natebud> Even if you don't hit the bullets, back it still does a LOT of damage as a melee attack.
[3:26:11] <%Laecerelius> Endless traaash!!
[3:26:17] <%logoth_> Why is the merchant a 1930s bartender and not also a gun
[3:26:18] <%deviljhojho94> "Hysterical streaemr goes ona 3 hour rant against audience, gun"
[3:26:26] <%Dr_DangerPhD> with the high rate of synergies now Ducktape can make some stupid powerful combos
[3:26:32] <%ElenaManetta> You just hold the fire button for a couple of seconds until your character readies the bat and you see a a twinkle, then get within a semi-close distance and let go and you'll melee them
[3:26:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You want to get the Paige approved Gold Gun?
[3:26:35] <theangryguyofde> Pat will never get the time bullet and prevent himself from getting pregnant NotLikeThis
[3:26:41] <natebud> Awesome
[3:26:41] <lloyddboy> BEES
[3:26:41] <Zuzu_Pachulia> BEEES
[3:26:44] <calamarvelous> Marine is his favorite character because he looks like Pat

[3:26:52] <%Kataguro> The new starting weapon is the best I think. The stun factor is fantastic
[3:26:53] <%ElenaManetta> That looks like a bullet with a turban, not a hive
[3:26:53] <%NobleJedi> not the BEEEEES
[3:26:53] <simulationbard> BEESSS

[3:27:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> at least its not the Snake Gun from the Stick Fight game
[3:27:05] <%lazysaiyajin> lazysaiyajin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! hey Pat, trackpad on macbook is the true way to play gungeon (jk it was awful)
[3:27:05] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> NOT THE BEEEES
[3:27:07] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Just do not let Paige see them.
[3:27:07] <%MisterRockett> I still haven't gotten a single finished run in this game. I got to the very last floor with none of the bullet parts once and was infuriated with myself.
[3:27:07] <+BonusSkeleton> pats greatest of fears guns that shoot living needles
[3:27:08] <ghostravens> the pat-bee nonsense is coming back
[3:27:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> what does vorpal do?
[3:27:09] <Calamity2007> A deadly bee weapon. Bees, my god
[3:27:10] <televisedrevolting> Casey is the best.
[3:27:10] <+lokiluko> little living syringes Pat, how does that make you feel?
[3:27:11] <mayorrev> How much do you like bees pat

[3:27:14] <+Grayhammatter> not the BEES
[3:27:16] <%strugglepunk2> would that make it a beeshirt cannon?
[3:27:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> So they prevent pregnorancy.
[3:27:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, focus fire, dude
[3:27:23] <%JayEarly> I'm pretty sure bee bullets are a warcrime under international law
[3:27:23] <%spiritofmojave> It's insane how great bees are in this

[3:30:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> who's the tool who said to destroy it? hed have been better opening it
[3:30:55] <%JayEarly> this is a valuable lesson
[3:30:58] <%AncelDeLambert> the most regularist
[3:31:15] <%SrG00SE> bless us bees
[3:31:15] <%Jetsfantasy> Marine passive makes the handgun feel even better
[3:31:16] <%Laecerelius> It's hip to fuck bees!
[3:31:17] <%logoth_> Bee turns the game into Anthem
[3:31:20] <alwayspronking> BEEEEEEES
[3:31:23] <+lokiluko> it's pretty great with the lil bomber, since they explode while charging and you can fire infiniately for no ammo
[3:31:24] <%Niney_Who> If only you had a key
[3:31:24] <talisign> If only he had a key....
[3:31:26] <%Niney_Who> Kappa
[3:31:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @order_of_mystery We thought it was locked, and not behind a gate.
[3:31:27] <%MegboyManuel> always preferred the convict pistol for rapid fire
[3:31:27] <natebud> I can't believe it

[3:32:22] <DracaenaLeaf> gotta protect the eyeballs
[3:32:23] <+Grayhammatter> paige please

[3:32:26] <%SrG00SE> quick! turn off my defenses!
[3:32:27] <+combomaniadeluxe> good taste
[3:32:30] <%MegboyManuel> Scrambler is death with red mages tho
[3:32:32] <ButtPlacenta> hell yea scambler
[3:32:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> scrambler is fantastic
[3:32:33] <Mr_Strut> Well yeah, what if the bee tries to sting her eyes?
[3:32:34] <%Jetsfantasy> It's just hilarious to think bees could come out of the Scrambler
[3:32:34] <Jolly_Adventurer> That doesn't make sense. But its Piage so that makes sense
[3:32:37] <%spiritofmojave> Scrambler is a won-run with bees too
[3:32:38] <%ElenaManetta> I noticed the HP bar went translucent when Pat got near the bottom screen for the boss. It doesn't do that for the Switch version. Is there a way to turn that option on?
[3:32:39] <%JayEarly> Damn you gangster ghosts
[3:32:39] <theangryguyofde> says the guy who is scared of barbers spitting in his hair LUL
[3:32:43] <+lokiluko> good for room clearing, terrible boss damage
[3:32:44] <%Kataguro> Scrambler + Backup Gun + Shadow Bullets = Won Run
[3:32:49] <%MegboyManuel> Paige would live through birdbox
[3:33:02] <%Laecerelius> The bees are Pat's onlly friends
[3:33:06] <%bevyrage> bevyrage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Yeah boi it's a romp in the Gungeon! Had a thought that may be rhetorical: Have you put thought into a wig or toupee even as a joke or costume but decided otherwise due to contact with strange hair being disgusting? Apologies for the wierd. Good stream!
[3:33:16] <%ElenaManetta> The prehistoric gun
[3:33:17] <StaticSunrise> hip holster

[3:33:23] <rsg220> @AngriestPat how is aiming on controller feel?
[3:33:23] <%Kataguro> Hip Holster
[3:33:24] <+combomaniadeluxe> @ElenaManetta It was added with the the new update to all versions Im pretty sure
[3:33:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> Pat has issues using consumables, but he has no problem wasting precious special gun ammo on generic mook enemies. what even.
[3:33:38] <%MegboyManuel> Bow is okay
[3:33:39] <%Niney_Who> Bow sucks ass
[3:33:42] <natebud> 54 for a bow!?
[3:33:43] <DavidSanChan> gunther floor 1 was cool
[3:33:48] <%Hammerknife> bow is not bad on early floors
[3:33:53] <%Kataguro> Bow is good if you're desperate
[3:33:54] <%Hammerknife> use all its ammo and munch it
[3:33:54] <%spiritofmojave> Cupid bow is better anyway
[3:34:00] <%MyDarkStorm> Feeling it now Mr Krabs
[3:34:02] <%El_Desperad0> same
[3:34:07] <Saltmeisterr> sticky grossbow is fun
[3:34:09] <natebud> cupid bow is useful, but it just feels bad to use
[3:34:10] <cowardlord> Hey guys how many runs do you fellas go for per a session of gungeon?
[3:34:11] <%MegboyManuel> its a shittier crossbow
[3:34:14] <%JayEarly> I've always imagined that shopkeeper to have a Russian accent

[3:34:59] <%Cavumentum> Shellbee.
[3:35:02] <televisedrevolting> @hammerknife Can confirm.

[3:38:20] <simulationbard> Pat's relationship advice is always so helpful
[3:38:20] <Finakala> Mineflayer is definitely a stage 4 boss though
[3:38:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't just put out the dumpster fire. Help start it.
[3:38:24] <%MegboyManuel> the bees almost betray
[3:38:25] <flubber3d> Can true love bloom in the dumpster
[3:38:26] <%SaltyDongs> Find a dumpster and hit on girls from it?
[3:38:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's real love.

[3:43:16] <Floofiie> "worst item" EXCUSE ME?
[3:43:18] <+Retrash> The chaos ammolet has a synergy with your relodestone @AngriestPat
[3:43:19] <+lokiluko> doing all the bonus zones gives you 10-20 extra items, makes the endgame absurdly easy every time. Second floor is the hardert floor, Bullet hell is a cake walk
[3:43:23] <%MyDarkStorm> F
[3:43:23] <%Kataguro> Pffft
[3:43:25] <%AzureGale> Get dat synergy chest

[3:43:26] <%SrG00SE> she lied
[3:43:29] <person181> that's something
[3:43:29] <%Hammerknife> just makes the stone bigger
[3:43:31] <+SolverCODO> perfect match!

[3:43:38] <SixthSun2> Makes stone BIG
[3:43:40] <Maleicus> gee i wonder
[3:43:44] <%AzureGale> Makes your stone bigger
[3:43:49] <%Hammerknife> relodestone combined with weapons that blank areas makes bosses *trivial*

[3:47:58] <+sparkjavelin> he already took it
[3:47:59] <natebud> The time it takes for the rat to come back becomes shorter each time
[3:48:00] <zipfile777> duh
[3:48:02] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat won't he come back later though?
[3:48:04] <%MegboyManuel> and it's gone

[3:48:19] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[3:48:22] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @energywarning LUL

[3:48:23] <+SolverCODO> Michael's Boom Room

[3:48:46] <natebud> Slide on the big table
[3:48:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> What did he lose?
[3:48:52] <%Niney_Who> YEYEYE

[3:48:58] <Ion_Laser> ye ye ye
[3:48:59] <%spiritofmojave> I'd love that
[3:48:59] <%AncelDeLambert> bye bye, yakoozis
[3:49:00] <+BoomerTiro> Mt fave roguelike is still NetHack
[3:49:02] <+SolverCODO> yeah @PeachSaliva drink some damn water
[3:49:03] <%MegboyManuel> havent played Hades yet, not sure about early access in general
[3:49:06] <+KSabot> gungeon has surpassed isaac for me
[3:49:07] <%El_Desperad0> Weekly Gungeon sounds great
[3:49:07] <VritraReiRei> Weekly Gungeon PogChamp
[3:49:11] <%SrG00SE> sure as long as it doesnt postpone New Vegas anymore than its been postpones indefinitely
[3:49:11] <DavidSanChan> wring out elmo for leftover red bull
[3:49:11] <talisign> I'd love weekly gungeon if he used more characters
[3:49:12] <%Cavumentum> Weekly Hades/Gungeon would be fun
[3:49:20] <%spiritofmojave> Gungeon until you get the ridiculous unlock conditions for Gunslinger LUL
[3:49:21] <%brickwall35> never played this, is the aiming automatic or is it stick based?
[3:49:28] <%StEmlosWater> 水を飲めばいいです
[3:49:30] <leviathan666303> you should definetly stream gungeon more often
[3:49:30] <+lokiluko> has he kind of dropped warframe at this point? i couldn't maintain much interest after finishing the story and starchart
[3:49:35] <%Kataguro> Key > Macho Brace
[3:49:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I like how evading over tables makes you do a little slide... and with a ton in a row it's a comically long slidee
[3:49:40] <SixthSun2> Neat Pokemon reference there
[3:49:41] <%MegboyManuel> Gungeon fun to watch
[3:49:41] <+SolverCODO> Pat still plays Warframe
[3:49:45] <Clyderso> "Aiming is dick based"
[3:49:46] <Mnightshyamallama> I am sad dead cells didn't work its way into the conversation
[3:49:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @brickwall35 Real men use a mouse
[3:50:10] <Arweynn> Just make it a generic weekly rogue like slot, and rotate what you do according to whim
[3:50:11] <gustavozxd> i just booted up dead cells rn
[3:50:11] <Mnightshyamallama> YAY

[3:50:33] <a_mad_dragon> real men use a trackball, take the ball out and manually rotate the rollers
[3:50:34] <CptBritches> Pat ate Elmo, Paige! It was horrible!
[3:50:36] <person181> are you alive paige?
[3:50:39] <%MegboyManuel> One Step from Eden is looking good a rogue like
[3:50:41] <natebud> We're long pat isaac
[3:50:43] <+SolverCODO> m o u t h f e e l

[3:50:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> gungeon is infinitely better than Isaac
[3:50:51] <thegreenbenis> M Y S U M M E R C A R
[3:50:53] <+SolverCODO> I was also going to say mouthfeel just before Pat did lol
[3:50:54] <%ClutchRoadagain> Too late
[3:50:54] <%spiritofmojave> Pat ate all of Elmo but his tail earlier
[3:50:54] <+ABadIdea> You can't get Giant Armored Red Soy Shots all the time doodSprinkle
[3:50:56] <%vectorless_peon> what joke?
[3:50:56] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Pat NO. Remember the pain of laywer fees!
[3:50:56] <mayorrev> delet
[3:50:57] <%Kataguro> Buy key, open blue
[3:50:58] <Reanimator83> Elmo has ascended to his next form
[3:50:58] <SixthSun2> Yes, the mouth feel of the YOUNG CHILD
[3:50:59] <+Zilla93> lionBumbo
[3:51:00] <ghostravens> joke has been deleted
[3:51:01] <+Arkfyre> m o u t h f e e l
[3:51:04] <@PeachSaliva> Why isn’t anyone talking about the mouthfeel?!??
[3:51:07] <+NekoNinja13> wizard of legend is also a great rougelite
[3:51:07] <dmac63> just got this on psn today, shits fun
[3:51:08] <%Cavumentum> Gotta get that CP, just like the Yakuzies!
[3:51:08] <lloyddboy> GET KEYS
[3:51:10] <%SrG00SE> @AngriestPat are you not a fan of FTL? wont hate you if thats the case just been curious why you've dodge it so hard
[3:51:17] <%Hammerknife> open every chest now pat, get full gunknight armor
[3:51:19] <%Kataguro> Open second blue
[3:51:20] <+SolverCODO> we should ALL be discussing the mouth feel
[3:51:20] <hussdogrob> what about ROGUE LEGACY MAN!?!
[3:51:22] <%ClutchRoadagain> Pat thought about the prospect of beating Isaac w/
[3:51:23] <%MegboyManuel> hard to say one gungeon is better than isaac, it's a matter of opinion and preference
[3:51:23] <%Hammerknife> each piece you get makes the others more likely
[3:51:28] <%ClutchRoadagain> without mods and it scared him
[3:51:30] <%Kataguro> Smart dwarf
[3:51:30] <%daisyyyy> pats too much of a coward to play my summer car
[3:51:32] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> "Look at how broken you are you delicious, delicious child." - Pat, 2015 maybe
[3:51:33] <%ClutchRoadagain> my keyboard loves me
[3:51:33] <+LoganWulfric> Better to wait on Isaac anyways, DLC on the way
[3:51:35] <indig0bird> m o u t h f e e l
[3:51:37] <%SrG00SE> got ya, was curious.
[3:51:38] <SixthSun2> 300 sleepers dead
[3:51:40] <lloyddboy> 300 CONFIRMED KILLS
[3:51:41] <+BoomerTiro> "I am not a fan of ftl, I love ftl"
[3:51:41] <Dr_Mooose> it's fun...until the final boss
[3:51:43] <%MegboyManuel> FTL too brutal for me
[3:51:43] <mayorrev> PILLOW!
[3:51:43] <DavidSanChan> no papyrus on it though
[3:51:45] <Smaenus> FTL is fucking hard
[3:51:49] <%ClutchRoadagain> dwarf fortress when Pat?
[3:51:50] <+lag2993> i wonder how that warframe ftl mode is gonna be
[3:51:51] <%Hammerknife> FTL has too much RNG against it and its pretty easy to exhaust the content
[3:51:51] <+d00msdaydan> that's why you play ftl with the mod that removes the enemy fleet mechanic
[3:51:52] <natebud> I hate the pillow, but its sooo good NotLikeThis
[3:51:55] <gustavozxd> definetly not an easy game yeah
[3:51:57] <Mnightshyamallama> FTL is the dark souls of dark souls
[3:51:59] <%Order_of_Mystery> FTL's final boss is unfair and poorly designed. you literally have to get lucky to beat it.
[3:51:59] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @hussdogrob I’ll do you one better: the original “Rogue”!
[3:52:01] <+ForteBlade> FTL isn't hard, its just pure RNG
[3:52:03] <hussdogrob> Rogue Legacy has Rogue from Rogue lite in the name man
[3:52:03] <%MegboyManuel> that pillow drawing by shockz was ADORABLE
[3:52:03] <%kknutson4> it's fine tho play it on easy
[3:52:09] <+sparkjavelin> you can manual the pillow
[3:52:13] <hussdogrob> @waithowdidigethere also good
[3:52:14] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I love FTL, but I've never defeated the final boss on what is at least a few hundred runs
[3:52:18] <%SrG00SE> yeah as a streaming game i can see it being a nightmare. for a night in? you can just keep restarting your run until you get the right first stage
[3:52:20] <Arweynn> FTL needed rng guardrails
[3:52:20] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat what's it shooting, zippers?
[3:52:22] <%Hammerknife> also FTL's final boss is worthless - invalidates boarding strategies
[3:52:23] <SixthSun2> FTL's biggest problem is it's end game
[3:52:27] <%Kataguro> Good job
[3:52:32] <Ion_Laser> Nice
[3:52:34] <%Laecerelius> I hated FTL's final boss
[3:52:34] <hussdogrob> @waithowdidigethere but you can't be a farting dwarf in that one
[3:52:35] <%Hammerknife> the only decent way to do the final boss is normal shooting
[3:52:36] <$CarlosEoM> Kappa //
[3:52:36] <zipfile777> NUKE
[3:52:36] <%Kataguro> Mmmm Gold Shell
[3:52:36] <+Datsensei> That odd moment of missing a live stream to watch the podcast
[3:52:37] <%spiritofmojave> eyy
[3:52:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sixthsun2 Dead Sleepers? That's how we can make magic work again! It was so obvious! Time for a muggle holocaust. sipsipHellmo

[3:52:43] <%skizzuto> but it's a fucking NUKE
[3:52:44] <%Hammerknife> big boy is amazing
[3:52:47] <%kknutson4> FTL's easy mode is basically normal anyways
[3:52:48] <+sparkjavelin> but the Big Boi is real good
[3:52:50] <Onamar> It's elder blank + BIG DAMAGE
[3:52:51] <mayorrev> TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING
[3:52:52] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I just realized that these bullet enemies would discharge if you shoved a metal pin up their asses...
[3:52:55] <%Kataguro> Go buy key, yeyeye
[3:53:02] <%MegboyManuel> dude the nuke does SO much damage
[3:53:04] <LiteralFraud> @AngriestPat You can tell if it's a pedestal mimic if you look right underneath the item, the little rectangles will look like eyes and they'll blink
[3:53:04] <ghostravens> what does a curse do in this game?
[3:53:06] <thegreenbenis> Pat play Escape From Tarkov.
[3:53:10] <%Kataguro> See? Blue good
[3:53:15] <talisign> That a good gun!
[3:53:16] <%Hammerknife> 1851 isnt any better than normal marine sidearm
[3:53:19] <%SrG00SE> @thegreenbenis can you gimme the low down and what that game is?
[3:53:22] <GundamF91> Man the music is fucking banging in this game holy shit
[3:53:24] <natebud> That's going to be great with marine skill
[3:53:26] <LiteralFraud> You aim it
[3:53:26] <%Hammerknife> you aim it
[3:53:27] <Onamar> You aim it
[3:53:27] <%Kataguro> Aim on PC, not sure on controller
[3:53:28] <+sparkjavelin> aim
[3:53:28] <%skizzuto> @ghostravens chance for cursed enemies to spawn
[3:53:28] <Monkeyweed21> you aim
[3:53:29] <p3nguin32> aim
[3:53:29] <%Hammerknife> makes a big red drop area
[3:53:30] <%El_Desperad0> Aim
[3:53:30] <%MegboyManuel> it's a summoner AOE
[3:53:32] <talisign> Aime
[3:53:32] <worldbrand> You eat it!
[3:53:35] <%MegboyManuel> aim the AOE
[3:53:36] <televisedrevolting> @kataguro Blue is alright, sometimes.
[3:53:37] <%RobotPancake> Jas pat played moonlighter?
[3:53:43] <ghostravens> @skizzuto ah i see. thank you

[3:54:12] <%Kataguro> All slain
[3:54:13] <Xhog1> Oh hey I came to see you playing this game
[3:54:13] <%StEmlosWater> @screamingmeat that’s not the colt SAA
[3:54:14] <SixthSun2> PogChamp
[3:54:15] <Warbot40> Moonlighters cool...wish it was better
[3:54:15] <Dr_Mooose> dead
[3:54:17] <SnowCrane> F

[3:54:20] <BinaryShuffle> EXPLOOOOSION
[3:54:23] <%Kataguro> That's The Button
[3:54:24] <Saltmeisterr> GET FUCKED
[3:54:25] <%lazysaiyajin> JEEBUS
[3:54:25] <%El_Desperad0> Very powerful

[3:54:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[3:54:27] <Smaenus> Ok then
[3:54:29] <worldbrand> It's the only way to be sure
[3:54:29] <%Cavumentum> Absolutely CLEANSED
[3:54:30] <thegreenbenis> @SrG00SE Absurdly detailed Stalker. You can customize every single part on your GUN. You go around and get into fight with other dudes and bots with guns.
[3:54:31] <ghostravens> nani the fuck
[3:54:31] <%Laecerelius> That's a godo button!
[3:54:32] <%TheTakkster> wow
[3:54:32] <LVDoomien> thanks Mr. Torque
[3:54:33] <%Order_of_Mystery> pat did a Fallout!
[3:54:35] <%Rafferty3231> So, Pat, what's it like having the mustard all to yourself?
[3:54:35] <%daisyyyy> I love the colt but it aint tye greatest
[3:54:36] <%MegboyManuel> You can make it bigger and stronger i believe
[3:54:36] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Have you played Recettear?
[3:54:37] <natebud> navy pistol does one more damage than marine pistol and its automatic.
[3:54:38] <+Chillwind700> What the hell was that
[3:54:41] <xeros720> good button
[3:54:42] <%StEmlosWater> B e g o n e
[3:54:42] <Xhog1> I finally came to appeciate this game after many many hours of getting fucked
[3:54:44] <%SrG00SE> fuck yeah POOR MANS ROSE
[3:54:48] <%Kataguro> Big Boy. Worth the curse
[3:54:50] <mayorrev> Is this a social commentary on nuclear war like MGS5 was?
[3:54:54] <+bellicoseweeb> Went into Moonlighter expecting Recettear. Was disappointed
[3:54:57] <%Kataguro> Capitalism, ho!
[3:55:05] <Xhog1> That first climb to getting enjoyment out of this game is fucking steep
[3:55:08] <Ner234> Reccetear is neat.
[3:55:10] <+starzo0> Its great
[3:55:10] <+ABadIdea> I love Recettear! Capitalism, ho! doodMaxhype
[3:55:12] <%SrG00SE> @thegreenbenis very very cool. sounds like some good gun pr0n
[3:55:15] <%MegboyManuel> Moonlighter is an incredibly well crafted game
[3:55:21] <%spiritofmojave> I'm not sure if I like the Colt or SAA terms of Revolvers, SAA's bounciness and reload time are exhilarating
[3:55:22] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Pat, grab four friends and play Siege on stream. Dare you, coward. :)
[3:55:22] <%Hammerknife> AMMO CREEP
[3:55:22] <Mr_Strut> I just wish endgame recettear was more than just grinding drops
[3:55:27] <%Hammerknife> pat get the ammo creep
[3:55:27] <%MegboyManuel> it's animations are outstanding
[3:55:29] <gustavozxd> it's pretty cool but man i'm not a fan of the time limits for stuff
[3:55:30] <Warbot40> @nothingistru it's an item shop management sim/dungeon crawler roguelite
[3:55:41] <Xramram1324x> @Xramram1324x is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[3:55:46] <%Hammerknife> the red box enemy that ran away
[3:55:46] <+HellfireComms> pulling an all night while I render footage for my kh3 lp, this is helping a lot Pat so thank you
[3:55:47] <%Hammerknife> you missed it
[3:55:47] <LVDoomien> yo @Xramram1324x !
[3:55:47] <Xhog1> Pat you have a favorite weapon in this game so far?
[3:55:48] <%Kataguro> There was an Ammo Goblin but don't worry about it
[3:55:56] <%MegboyManuel> you missed ammo goblin
[3:55:57] <natebud> one of the enemies that runs away and despawns
[3:55:58] <%Niney_Who> Ammo Goblin escaped
[3:55:59] <BaslerJones> have you played hammerwatch ?
[3:55:59] <+nothingistru> Oh ok thanks
[3:56:03] <%TheTakkster> there were both creeps
[3:56:04] <+burritocheetos> my b
[3:56:04] <%Kataguro> You killed the key one. It's all good
[3:56:10] <%SrG00SE> man i love poor mans rose (watched all of hxh last week lmao)
[3:56:34] <%RobotPancake> is there a chair gun in this game? where you just shoot folded steel chairs
[3:56:37] <%MegboyManuel> someone be my B, im so lonely sbfpSetIn
[3:56:41] <thegreenbenis> @SrG00SE It's great gun porn, I took an Ar-15 and put an optical sight on it as well as a compensator.
[3:56:44] <%Kataguro> GOddamn, this luck
[3:56:47] <Warbot40> I made a comparison video of Recettear and Moonlighter about a half year ago.
[3:56:47] <zipfile777> wow
[3:56:59] <+CrimPls> Pat I love you
[3:57:01] <SixthSun2> RED CHEST
[3:57:02] <zipfile777> long Link
[3:57:03] <%Kataguro> Fuck yeah, RC Rocket
[3:57:04] <%MegboyManuel> STINGER!!!!
[3:57:04] <Monkeyweed21> YO
[3:57:07] <ScreamingMeat> I still find it hilarious that anti-gun people think a Suppressor actually makes a gun totally silent
[3:57:07] <Saltmeisterr> LONK
[3:57:08] <DavidSanChan> metal geeear
[3:57:09] <%MegboyManuel> oh
[3:57:09] <LVDoomien> big boy rocket
[3:57:10] <%Hammerknife> wait how does rc rocket work with controller
[3:57:10] <+sparkjavelin> not stinger
[3:57:11] <%spiritofmojave> YEYEYEYE
[3:57:13] <%Cavumentum> Nothing is as satisfying as "you didn't win" embodied by a nuke detonated based on your heartbeat stopping
[3:57:13] <p3nguin32> thats some good stuff
[3:57:14] <%MegboyManuel> Dammit.
[3:57:14] <Xhog1> If you happen to find junkington and gold junk, that’s all but a run winner. I got that in a recent run and it destroyed everything
[3:57:15] <VritraReiRei> BOSS KILLER PogChamp
[3:57:22] <Finakala> It's pretty clunky with controller tbf
[3:57:22] <+Chillwind700> That’s why I like Hunter, Hunters starting pistol feels so good to use
[3:57:23] <natebud> the true stinger fires bees
[3:57:25] <energywarning> the goal should be beating floor 1, 2, and oubliette with the starting weapon. it saves a lot of ammo for later floors
[3:57:29] <%logoth_> lonk and petch
[3:57:35] <%spiritofmojave> is that just the fucking Nikea launcher
[3:57:38] <lloyddboy> BLESSED RUN

[4:01:37] <dalmek> @AngriestPat Gamma Ray branches twice to form a spread of 5 beams. Using Big Boy refills 100 Gamma Ray ammo.

[4:01:38] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat If the player also has Big Boy, Gamma Ray branches twice to form a spread of 5 beams and using Big Boy refills 100 ammo on the Gamma Ray. Ammo restoration only works if Gamma Ray is held when activating Big Boy.
[4:01:41] <LVDoomien> it does the same poison damage as the nuke @AngriestPat
[4:01:41] <LiteralFraud> Gamma Ray fires a spread
[4:01:42] <leviathan666303> nuke plus gamma
[4:01:44] <Floofiie> If the player also has Gamma Ray, Gamma Ray branches twice to form a spread of 5 beams, and using Big Boy refills 100 ammo on the Gamma Ray. Ammo restoration only works if Gamma Ray is held when activating Big Boy.

[4:07:43] <natebud> @AngriestPat the Colt 1851 fires three tight spreads of three bullets upon reloading.

[4:07:46] <lloyddboy> DUELING LASER
[4:07:48] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat the Colt 1851 fires three tight spreads of three bullets upon reloading. These projectiles do not use ammo, and they can reveal secret rooms without angering the shopkeeper Bello.
[4:07:50] <Floofiie> If the player has Colt 1851, it fires three tight spreads of three bullets upon reloading. These projectiles can ignore tables when fired from behind them, and they can reveal secret rooms without angering the shopkeeper Bello.
[4:07:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ALL BLANKS
[4:07:55] <Floofiie> how do i delete my msg

[4:08:02] <LVDoomien> can somebody explain real quick how the synergies work? is it just if you have a and b together?
[4:08:05] <+SolverCODO> Could Pat POSSIBLY fuck up this run?
[4:08:06] <%El_Desperad0> @AngriestPat the colt fires three free bullets that deal double damage upon reloading, they also ignore tables
[4:08:08] <%MegboyManuel> yeah the blanks mean free master round, almost
[4:08:13] <+PanicSwytch> PAT HAS BECOME THE GUN
[4:08:21] <%Order_of_Mystery> @angriestpat If the player has Table Tech Sight, Escape Rope, Hip Holster, or Heart Holster, the Colt 1851 fires three tight spreads of three bullets upon reloading. These projectiles do not use ammo, and they can reveal secret rooms without angering the shopkeeper Bello.

[4:09:43] <%MegboyManuel> no
[4:09:44] <tacostarvedbeast> any chance of getting fuggins or someone in here for some coop?
[4:09:44] <lloyddboy> nah
[4:09:46] <%ElenaManetta> Get rid of the Pillow gun
[4:09:46] <%spiritofmojave> Silencer for sure
[4:09:46] <%Dr_DangerPhD> nah not worth it pretty much ever
[4:09:47] <%ElenaManetta> it's kind of crap
[4:09:48] <%AncelDeLambert> it needs four guns, right?
[4:09:50] <natebud> it will give you a bad gun, if you give it bad guns
[4:09:52] <%Kataguro> It's a waste
[4:09:52] <lethallylactic> 2
[4:09:53] <+FennecZephyr> gamma has a synnergy
[4:09:53] <%El_Desperad0> DO IT
[4:09:54] <%MegboyManuel> fair enough
[4:09:54] <LiteralFraud> Gungeon Eagle can be charged pat @AngriestPat
[4:09:56] <Xhog1> Nah
[4:09:57] <benjiFG> do it
[4:09:57] <Floofiie> gamma ray has a synergy
[4:10:01] <%MegboyManuel> yeah gamma deagle, do it
[4:10:02] <LiteralFraud> shots do more damage that way
[4:10:02] <SixthSun2> Gamma has synergy
[4:10:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> GAMMA is that SYNERGY
[4:10:08] <%Kataguro> You'll get a C at best
[4:10:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Deagle is strong if charged
[4:10:11] <Xhog1> Don’t trash ones with synergy
[4:10:19] <Floofiie> @AngriestPat Come back after you get your boss drop
[4:10:21] <%ElenaManetta> You can open your book and see what has synergy by hovering over each item individually
[4:10:21] <natebud> between a C and a D if you use those two
[4:10:26] <VritraReiRei> 2 guns for the one. Red one can use like 10
[4:10:27] <xeros720> gammas synergy seems really good
[4:10:28] <%MegboyManuel> terrible gun
[4:10:29] <%AncelDeLambert> well, if you don't like it, reroll it
[4:10:39] <natebud> You can charge the deagle but it's not worth it @AngriestPat
[4:10:41] <tacostarvedbeast> synergy patch made the trading 2 guns for one almost never worth it
[4:10:44] <r_Foeburden87> I clipped that fire safety lava shit
[4:10:53] <+FennecZephyr> I say feed it the deagle and the silencer if anything
[4:10:56] <%Order_of_Mystery> ditch eagle
[4:10:58] <wal__rus> pat
[4:10:58] <calamarvelous> You killed Bubble Bobble!!!
[4:11:03] <%Laecerelius> yeah feed it the deagle and silenceer
[4:11:04] <%Niney_Who> Deagle and Silencer
[4:11:04] <conflict1914> When they say everything's a gun, they really mean it
[4:11:10] <%MegboyManuel> deagle + pillow
[4:11:23] <+BigBoy3535> Gungeon is so fucking good
[4:11:27] <tacostarvedbeast> @MegboyManuel peagle
[4:11:28] <SixthSun2> Doesn't he have a gun that's basically the TMP?
[4:11:29] <DavidSanChan> mionecart kills for phat acheevos
[4:11:37] <natebud> The pillow does really good damage, but i still hate it
[4:11:39] <%Kataguro> Open blue?
[4:11:42] <%MegboyManuel> Peagle.
[4:11:43] <lloyddboy> DUELING LASER
[4:11:51] <%AncelDeLambert> he certainly has enough ammo for everything, why NOT reroll?
[4:11:53] <%SrG00SE> bonb
[4:11:54] <%ElenaManetta> Does it break?
[4:11:55] <%ElenaManetta> I've never used it
[4:11:56] <%Kaz_zaK> Kaz_zaK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 7 months wow uh apatRaffle i guess
[4:11:58] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[4:11:59] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if you get hit it breaks
[4:11:59] <%cryobyjorn> ***
[4:12:01] <%Kataguro> Sure does. Get hit with it and break
[4:12:03] <%Luna_Ashford> Especially against living things!
[4:12:04] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat the brown one has a passive or active
[4:12:07] <ShichiNoBushi> It's VERY powerful. Especially against living things.
[4:12:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> its like the balloon gun
[4:12:10] <%Niney_Who> If you get hit while using it, it breaks
[4:12:11] <%MegboyManuel> wow it actually breaks
[4:12:12] <%AncelDeLambert> yay, junk for the junk friend!
[4:12:15] <tacostarvedbeast> if u get dusa boss itll be a cake walk, shes the easiest imo
[4:12:22] <%daisyyyy> It "breaks" but ammo restores it
[4:12:23] <%SrG00SE> not a bad idea
[4:12:26] <%El_Desperad0> That you never use
[4:12:27] <%Kataguro> Inb4 trash

[4:21:11] <natebud> star is timed invincibility, but you get curse.
[4:21:13] <%Hammerknife> ooo
[4:21:16] <%Kataguro> It sucks is what it is
[4:21:18] <Saltmeisterr> OOOH
[4:21:20] <lethallylactic> Invincibility
[4:21:22] <%Hammerknife> the star is not good and not worth the curse
[4:21:23] <%Niney_Who> It's invulnerability
[4:21:24] <%MegboyManuel> its an okay cross bow
[4:21:24] <StaticSunrise> nuke is better
[4:21:25] <%skizzuto> no
[4:21:25] <tacostarvedbeast> mario star
[4:21:26] <Floofiie> While active, makes the player rainbow-colored and invincible.
[4:21:27] <+Retrash> your nuke is better
[4:21:29] <%Hammerknife> you already have FMJ and nuke
[4:21:29] <Dral54> AMMOLETS
[4:21:29] <lloyddboy> RING
[4:21:29] <%MegboyManuel> Nuke better
[4:21:30] <%ElenaManetta> "While active, makes the player rainbow-colored and invincible."
[4:21:31] <+hrudzie_1> it sucks
[4:21:33] <%spiritofmojave> It's invincibility, but I wouldn't change it for the nuke
[4:21:33] <%Hammerknife> lament is very good
[4:21:37] <%El_Desperad0> ...Pat
[4:21:38] <%Kataguro> More knockback
[4:21:39] <+sparkjavelin> its an ITEM so it replaces your big boi
[4:21:40] <James_Quivers> AMMOLET IS MORE BLANKS
[4:21:42] <+This_is_Marco> Lament configurum!!
[4:21:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> buy Armour
[4:21:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only curse because of her shop
[4:21:45] <Dral54> +1 BLANK + effect
[4:21:46] <natebud> STAR is awesome and it replaces your bomb curse.
[4:21:47] <%Nope80808> The thinkl that lets you eat bullets to use is better
[4:21:50] <%ElenaManetta> The star would help against Dragon
[4:21:52] <%MegboyManuel> Nuke is just too good
[4:21:52] <SixthSun2> Lodestone is more blanks
[4:21:54] <lloyddboy> GET
[4:21:54] <$CarlosEoM> ye
[4:21:55] <+hrudzie_1> load is worth
[4:21:55] <laguerrilha> more blanks seem good
[4:21:56] <tacostarvedbeast> never liked any of the amulets tbh
[4:21:57] <Floofiie> You'll need blanks in bullet hell
[4:21:57] <Dral54> FOR 26
[4:21:58] <%El_Desperad0> But the star
[4:21:59] <VritraReiRei> SeemsGood
[4:21:59] <%Kataguro> Loadstone would be worth
[4:22:00] <%SrG00SE> also i think it makes your blanks stronger
[4:22:02] <$Ralfclogs> More armour
[4:22:04] <Dral54> ITS FREE BLANKS
[4:22:05] <%MegboyManuel> worth it for 26
[4:22:07] <p3nguin32> ammolets are good with the FMJ and all the armor you got
[4:22:07] <foreverN2dust> Pow!
[4:22:09] <+sparkjavelin> you want anything from the lock guy?
[4:22:12] <PerrinIsDead> Did I tune back in just in time for gobolins?
[4:22:26] <xeros720> extra blanks sounds very good
[4:22:27] <tacostarvedbeast> give him ur unwanted guns for money
[4:22:40] <+Retrash> sell some stuff and buy the 2nd ammolet maybe?
[4:22:43] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @AngriestPat if you drop items/gun on the grate he gives you money for them
[4:22:44] <natebud> This Sell creep gets you the new floor, have to give him two items and a master round @AngriestPat
[4:22:45] <%MegboyManuel> this + flak bullets is killer
[4:22:45] <%Kataguro> It's decent. Kind of a shit A rank
[4:22:49] <Floofiie> @AngriestPat You can access the new floor if you give the floor creep 1 Master Round, and 2 random items (can be junk)
[4:22:52] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat the sell creep unlocks a new area if you give him ANY Two Items + a Master Round
[4:22:58] <%Order_of_Mystery> drop your junk on the grate guy!
[4:23:11] <Dral54> @PerrinIsDead you tuned it time for Pat to crush it, his luck is insane right now

[4:23:20] <%MegboyManuel> automaticlly
[4:23:25] <+Chillwind700> Synergy is automatic
[4:23:30] <televisedrevolting> @laguerrilha Auto
[4:23:30] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Laecerelius auto, just depends on the items and guns you have
[4:23:36] <SixthSun2> That crossbow seems godlike for crowds
[4:23:52] <laguerrilha> thanks, i guess i didnt get any synergy with the guns i got. new to the game
[4:23:53] <tacostarvedbeast> at least sell the flame gun, synergies on it are ass
[4:24:07] <Dral54> if its a gun you lose the synergy when you drop it

[4:26:53] <$CarlosEoM> foolishness
[4:26:55] <Maleicus> didnt count LUL

[4:28:03] <%skizzuto> @FatherGreyBeard blanks normally have to be activated manually but Pat has an item that makes them activate automatically
[4:28:06] <Finakala> Blanks aren't armour, they're bombs, but Pat has a passive which makes you use up blanks before HP
[4:28:06] <%Hammerknife> wow is pat going to run out of armor in forge

[4:30:48] <%Dr_DangerPhD> gungeon feels a million times better to play
[4:30:48] <Pykeball> If you value JESUS, go Isaac.
[4:30:51] <%MegboyManuel> this game's fine tuning is incredible
[4:30:52] <a_mad_dragon> gungeon has a much tighter design than isaac
[4:30:54] <LVDoomien> that room got Deleted

[4:37:13] <OtterSlinger> Like a lot of the weapons are gimmicky and don't really have much punch to them since they aren't conventional enough
[4:37:18] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Better to play it safe and unlock paradox honestly
[4:37:18] <zipfile777> @AngriestPat take arm
[4:37:19] <Monkeyweed21> GAUNTLET
[4:37:23] <VritraReiRei> @Kirby_Sauce hitting any enemy has a chance to turn them into arrowkin, a VERY weak enemy
[4:37:24] <Monkeyweed21> grab arm
[4:37:25] <+Retrash> get the arm next to the smith @angriestpat
[4:37:25] <%joylent_blue> no its fine tho

[4:39:22] <MisterMister4> those knives have guns
[4:39:28] <FatherGreyBeard> I'm guessing the Past and Lich are like final bosses? They end your run when you kill them?

[4:40:30] <Finakala> It is @Hilleltaco
[4:40:31] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Final phase of dragun is basically a victory lap

[4:41:03] <A_Family_Man> @fathergreybeard Past is a short level that ends your run but basically nothing from your run carries on into it. Lich requires going through the longest/hardest level in the game and fighting the hardest boss in the game
[4:41:07] <person181> weird gun

[4:54:27] <%afronooch> mama paige!!
[4:54:27] <%SrG00SE> yeah it makes your bald worse because it exposes your fear of your own bald

[4:54:32] <%ShaneWhite> Yea

[4:54:42] <Monkeyweed21> what about the trump where you comb your side hair into a pseudo toupe
[4:54:43] <%AncelDeLambert> There's no wigs under your bed, Pat, go to sleep
[4:54:43] <ghostravens> just placebo the baldness away
[4:54:44] <%bevyrage> Thanks for the input, much more normal than expected honestly
[4:54:48] <+BoomerTiro> Better to just be who you are until you can get cyborg implants
[4:54:54] <%ShaneWhite> Unless the wig is that good it must be worn
