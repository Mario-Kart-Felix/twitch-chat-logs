[0:15:19] <%ShaneWhite> Cause we can hear your baby squeals
[0:15:20] <Grandune> Pat, your stream is quieter then everything else on the Internet
[0:15:21] <%BoboDaHobo> BoboDaHobo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Holy shit, a full years worth of support already? Thanks for being a constant source of laughs while I go through a pretty rough time in my life. Oh, and I'm early but happy mother-exiting day!

[0:22:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> @ScreamingMeat Honestly, I would start with 3 FES, it's kind of hard to go back when the later ones have controllable party members

[0:24:48] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Get that juice drained
[0:24:49] <SuperFightinRobot> The existence of sleep juice explains a lot about your dislike of human fluids.
[0:24:50] <BaronVonDickButt> Sometimes i thorwup in my sleep cause my stomach doesnt close all the way
[0:24:56] <+Deano8817> pat your only hope is to stay up so god damn late every day you somehow wake up at normal times again

[0:25:14] <DonatelloJose> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli I'm not familiar with DSP, so I will differ to your take.
[0:25:14] <MadMatt2099> Sounds like Noob's fatality in MK11.
[0:25:15] <+cafefunk> That sounds horribly painful
[0:25:16] <dekkitout> So boneitis?
[0:25:16] <%Fenlig> That would probably suck really hard
[0:25:20] <+vextalyst> that sounds horrifying and painful as hell
[0:25:20] <%SrG00SE> back2back redbull slamming champ
[0:25:20] <CptHarlok> That sounds way worse than a heartattack
[0:25:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> But steiner said not to drink red bull!
[0:25:21] <Ner234> Only two? Weakling
[0:25:23] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Drink more milk instead of red bull, then your skeleton will be much stronger than you
[0:25:24] <redial_nick> just 2?
[0:25:26] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Your arms would be left as flaps of skin
[0:25:26] <%0dokuro> !uptime
[0:25:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 25m 28s.
[0:25:34] <InugamiTheHound> according to Paige "Pat only drinks two red bulls" but we all know he drinks more
[0:25:37] <tearknack> @AngriestPat ay birthday boy/slowly rotting corpse, you here bout this kotor shit?
[0:25:41] <stolando_florida> The human skin is just a fursuit for your skeleton
[0:25:43] <+drakthebest> Pat: "I don't drink that many redbulls. only when I stream!" Also Pat: *Streams every day and guzzles 2-3 redbulls every stream

One guy wanted to be buried in a burnt up spacesuit at an angle with his feet sticking out of the ground like he fell from orbit and Plague said he wanted to be buried in a coffen with a porthole in it with his face in a maniacal Joker grin, all the flesh on his body removed except his face and a 2nd smaller skeleton inside his rib cage trying to escape

[0:37:54] <TReaperx1> in yakuza 6 they are pretty good
[0:37:59] <%bread_assassin> Yakuza 6 had some pretty good substories.
[0:38:00] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Yakuza 6 has FULLY Voice acted Sub-Stories which I think is the best
[0:38:03] <phatballlz54> yeah 2 was when the sub stories became batshit crazy
[0:38:04] <AMajorTom> How long until the adult baby sub stories start
[0:38:05] <Desertfishing> Idol life suuuuuucks

[0:38:34] <krymzen5> zero is the best non dragon engine easily
[0:38:35] <starotter70> They all suck
[0:38:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Zero is the best yakuza
[0:38:36] <%SrG00SE> h0nk
[0:38:37] <majima666> 0, kiwami 2, 4, kiwami, 5, 3
[0:38:39] <VritraReiRei> NONE OF THEM D:
[0:38:40] <$Mendin> Nugget is the most powerful

[0:38:43] <+Comrade_Vladof> Smash update is out
[0:38:45] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Yakuza Dead Souls is the best game Kappa
[0:38:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Zero is easily the best
[0:38:48] <TReaperx1> yakuza 6 and 2 are pretty good
[0:38:50] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> None of the games?
[0:38:51] <%connos_livereview> DRAGIN ENGINE

[0:38:54] <hottcoco> Zero before the first one for story?
[0:38:55] <%spiritofmojave> Zero is the best overall, Kiwami 2 is a close runner. 6 For me rivals 0 tho
[0:38:57] <%Tucker0603> I love the Micheal Jackson cover in 0
[0:39:00] <tj_timbs> of what i played: 0, kiwami 2, 6, kiwami 1
[0:39:01] <TheNewJapanGuy> Zero > Ishin > Kiwami 2 > Yakuza 4 > Yakuza 5 > Yakuza 6 > Kiwami
[0:39:05] <%0dokuro> Landlord Kiryu is best its ever been
[0:39:07] <+ATentacleMonster> Joker Kreygasm
[0:39:07] <DracaenaLeaf> dead souls
[0:39:08] <%SaltyDongs> zombie game?
[0:39:09] <Nekros4442> I'd still say 4 is my fav just cus Kiryu shows off his relative level against other protags
[0:39:11] <%troxcree> I look forward to seeing where FotNS falls in this.

[0:39:30] <BunnyEmperor> lulw
[0:39:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> So what you're saying is Dead Souls is pretty good.
[0:39:31] <%bread_assassin> 4 is higher than I thought.

[0:39:38] <RadSuit> How bad is it?
[0:39:38] <derekwst3> Pat is playing dead souls today?
[0:39:39] <TheNewJapanGuy> Dead Souls isn't a Yakuza game. Period.
[0:39:40] <Flarepulse> Pat I missed your voice
[0:39:42] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Stream it
[0:39:43] <%Omegaanimus> Would you play the samurai spin offs if they got localized?
[0:39:45] <$Desmond_Vakarian> dead souls was how i found out about the yakuza games
[0:39:46] <BunnyEmperor> Sounds like a good game for stream
[0:39:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Akiyama Da Best

[0:39:54] <InugamiTheHound> SSohPKC did a LP of dead souls back in the day
[0:39:56] <%lewdskeletor13> Dead Souls: Kiwami
[0:40:00] <a_mad_dragon> @AngriestPat is dead souls worse than DMC 2 ?
[0:40:05] <majima666> it was a dumb zombie game in a dumb yakuza world. as a sidegame it had potential but it ran like shit
[0:40:06] <%ShaneWhite> Pat Joker has just landed I’m gonna try him out and I’ll give you some feed back on how he handles and played
[0:40:07] <%unrolls> is yakuza 6 good?
[0:40:08] <vetrn7> its pretty bad
[0:40:09] <%joylent_blue> KIRBY WHY
[0:40:11] <%0dokuro> Its a card game
[0:40:11] <hottcoco> do you not need the story of yakuza 1 before zero?
[0:40:11] <phatballlz54> Kiwami 2 is really good too
[0:40:14] <%shiplord13> SSohPKC is a name I haven't heard in a long time

[0:40:46] <Ion_Laser> hold on. HOLD ON
[0:40:54] <+Promessa_EX> shadow run dwarves with shotguns yadayada
[0:40:58] <$bootysteve> Yo Kirby, Shadowrun Storytime has 21.5 parts and is suuuuuuper done

[0:41:07] <myman10407> Pat when are you going to stream NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: ULTIMATE NINJA STORM?
[0:41:08] <$bootysteve> If you're talking about 2D's threads
[0:41:08] <%ThatGuyfromMars> SSoH was great, I hope he's doing okay, whatever he's doing now
[0:41:15] <TheNewJapanGuy> The Engine oder is correct
[0:41:20] <TheNewJapanGuy> order
[0:41:21] <KeiPrime> kiwami 2 has so many QoL improvements over 6
[0:41:23] <KeiPrime> play 6 first
[0:41:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiwami 2 is better than Yakuza 6 from a technical standpoint.
[0:41:33] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Did you finish 5? 6 picks up AT THE SECOND 5 ENDS
[0:41:37] <Desertfishing> anyone hear white noise?
[0:41:38] <derekwst3> this is why you play pokemon
[0:41:39] <%0dokuro> Not the order Pat is playing it in lol
[0:41:40] <$bootysteve> @Kirby_Sauce You're talking about TwoDee's threads right
[0:41:50] <theangryguyofde> Yakuza 6 Engine is hilarious
[0:41:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 3 was not great
[0:41:53] <alexandrecau> kiwami 2 makes more sense if you play 6 becausee of the clan battle
[0:41:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Let’s rush through the rest of this game! Wooo!
[0:41:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Desertfishing I think it's from the game, I think it's raining ingame
[0:41:57] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Yeah going to Yakuza 6 after Kiwami 2 is going to be rough
[0:41:59] <phatballlz54> the best in gameplay
[0:42:02] <%GohanEgret> @NWR_James he's right at the end of 5
[0:42:03] <InugamiTheHound> @ThatGuyfromMars I use to watch him and other members of creatures and they died. I stop caring about james/cow chop. Chill Chaos is still around
[0:42:03] <%spiritofmojave> Dragon-engine is going be pretty solid once it moves to PC
[0:42:05] <+Ryutaryi> How to play Yakuza: Play 0. That's it.
[0:42:08] <derekwst3> so only play even games
[0:42:09] <Desertfishing> @ThatGuyfromMars oh ok ty
[0:42:09] <TheNewJapanGuy> For Now
[0:42:19] <reiju_22> just play 0 LUL
[0:42:21] <%NWR_James> @GohanEgret Cool. That last thing makes 6 make sense
[0:42:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just play Judgment and nothing else Kappa
[0:42:25] <r_Foeburden87> wait aorst game is base yakuza 2 ?
[0:42:33] <majima666> im glad i stuck with this series since day one then lol
[0:42:34] <FatherGreyBeard> Can't get the update due to so many people downloading the update
[0:42:35] <%0dokuro> Star Dust Crusaders
[0:42:36] <FatherGreyBeard> : (
[0:42:36] <Nekros4442> @r_Foeburden87 nah, that's 3
[0:42:39] <tj_timbs> let's solve the problem with our fists
[0:42:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InugamiTheHound I used to like the creatures until Kootra started being a massive douche. I still kinda follow nova, but I feel like he's always mean to ein
[0:42:42] <GundamF91> To be fair there putting out the 3 and 4 HD soon
[0:42:42] <Dral54> You gotta juggle combat systems like dante playing the yakuzies in that order
[0:42:45] <TReaperx1> hopefully we get a collection INCLUDING dead souls and the japanese released samurai games
[0:42:51] <majima666> remember seeing screenshots in a ps2 mag and thinking it looked so cool and realistic
[0:42:57] <%terminallyCapriciousz> yuya looks a lot like that one guy
[0:43:03] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Well they did say they were going to do HD updates for 3,4 and 5 for PS4 only though no PC port confirmed yet
[0:43:03] <derekwst3> still should play them in release order,
[0:43:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hi patty
[0:43:05] <$shurtal> Is Yuya's mouth too wide for his face? Is is that just me?
[0:43:06] <%lewdskeletor13> Let’s finish off this game!
[0:43:09] <%0dokuro> da final showdown
[0:43:11] <r_Foeburden87> Gotcha thx,
[0:43:18] <Ner234> That's nice that they tell you
[0:43:18] <%VioletHeart> So when's the Yakuza: Dead Souls stream, @AngriestPat ?
[0:43:20] <+Promessa_EX> do a big showdown
[0:43:21] <TheNewJapanGuy> Have you seen that Haruka mod that turns her into a boss fight? Its weird.
[0:43:21] <+Toppunchpoopbob> This is the end
[0:43:23] <%Ilpala271> this gon be a short ass stream
[0:43:25] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat How close are you actuallY?
[0:43:27] <derekwst3> so smash in 10 minutes
[0:43:29] <KeiPrime> yuya has fish lips
[0:43:30] <InugamiTheHound> @ThatGuyfromMars I stopped following all the creatures and the others. I didn't know derp crew is part of rooster teeth.
[0:43:30] <+Toppunchpoopbob> He's a Monkey man
[0:43:32] <theangryguyofde> last chance to shoot greasy steve PogChamp
[0:43:38] <Mr_Strut> I can't believe Pat is going to do a 7 hour pocket racing stream.
[0:43:41] <%afronooch> goron lookin ass
[0:43:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 pat, you always cum all over yourself when you talk about megaman zero or the original series, but what about the side games? What did you think of .exe or starforce? What about zx and zx advent? All good games, but i want to hear the stupid contrivance as to why you likely don't like them. And the previous comment was (clearly) about something called "shadowrun storytime" which is probably a bit of time, dedicated to telling stories, about shadowrunner games.
[0:43:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InugamiTheHound the what?
[0:43:41] <%Gatzarlok> How are there 6 games of people fucking with Kiryu... The dude literally fights people 1 on 100, he's arguably a god.
[0:43:42] <ScreamingMeat> LUL
[0:43:42] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Which yakuzi number is this?
[0:43:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> There are some weird looking people out there.

[0:43:58] <r_Foeburden87> One i believe
[0:43:58] <tj_timbs> this is yakuzi number 1
[0:44:02] <derekwst3> @lpkilledthetelltalestar Kiwami
[0:44:05] <Nekros4442> @Gatzarlok I'm pretty sure he actually does the whole 100 man kumite in one of the games
[0:44:08] <%snow_bush> Get Haruka to bust a heat move
[0:44:10] <KeiPrime> theres 8
[0:44:10] <%AncelDeLambert> they should all KNOW BY NOWWWWW
[0:44:11] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Thx
[0:44:12] <%shiplord13> More or less
[0:44:15] <KeiPrime> 10 if you count isshin and the other one
[0:44:15] <$bootysteve> @Kirby_Sauce PMing you the link to the finished series
[0:44:16] <TReaperx1> ask kratos

[0:44:26] <$bootysteve> @Kirby_Sauce Check your whispers
[0:44:29] <InugamiTheHound> @ThatGuyfromMars the derp crew is chilled chaos, ze, galm and tom. This was his group after he left the creatures in 2010
[0:44:35] <%AncelDeLambert> "Hey guys, let's go punch Godzilla"
[0:44:41] <emillionghost> LUL
[0:44:43] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat We can't kill him just just do whatever.
[0:44:45] <OhioNitsud> I would've loved it if Kiryu and Haruka 3D Nishiki through a table
[0:44:46] <robertoci3> i remember seeing somewhere that it was a initiation ritual for the gangs or something LUL
[0:44:47] <+Toppunchpoopbob> monkaS Kiryu
[0:44:47] <TheNewJapanGuy> A lot of the later games feature him less in place of new heros
[0:44:48] <MadMatt2099> Remember that time he dodged two rockets? Fucking love it
[0:44:49] <Dral54> Kiryu's here? WE OUT WE OUT WE OUT

[0:45:00] <kirijotakeharu> Kind of like Jotaro in Part 4
[0:45:01] <%GoldeNOVA> Just slow him down!
[0:45:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InugamiTheHound oh cool. I never was a huge fan of chilled, but I'm glad he's still doing well for himself
[0:45:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Hurricane Kiryu is coming
[0:45:02] <Basch71> Kiryu is the yakuza version of the boogey man
[0:45:04] <%shiplord13> Best decision would be giving Kiryu free tickets to go on vacation for two weeks
[0:45:05] <%GohanEgret> @OhioNitsud but those japanese tables are indestructable
[0:45:05] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> The dumb part is that Kiryu IS gone in 5, but dumbasses end up pulling him back in.
[0:45:11] <+Flambage> The day Kiryu dies World War 3 will start
[0:45:14] <%spiritofmojave> Just send Kiryu off on a goose-chase is the ultimate solution

[0:45:21] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 Now, I get what you're after, and I'm not saying you are wrong. I'll often use the doing paperwork excuse to sit on my ass in what passes for the fuel station office. But I'm a relatively new manager, I just wanted to have a shiny moment, because my vanity demands I be a big showboat-y cunt when and where I can be. And to be fair, the guy who wanted the manager position before I got it was whining I didn't do ENOUGH. Which he's right! I could have done more, but again, fuck that!
[0:45:21] <%NWR_James> Bad guys win in Y5 is they just left Kiryu alone!
[0:45:25] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I wasn't saying that ironcially.
[0:45:26] <Mnightshyamallama> Little late to the conversation but there is at least one of the Yakuza3-5 games available on psnow for ps4

[0:46:13] <ScreamingMeat> "You stole Kiryu's kid!? WHY!? Why would you steal Kiryu's kid!?"
[0:46:14] <%mastertwin2> Kiryu is just japanese John Wick
[0:46:16] <+zenraider> guys im stuck in an error loop with the new smash update !!!
[0:46:17] <r_Foeburden87> 4 ded already
[0:46:19] <%maskedriderhero> "are you messing with KIRYUS DAUGHTER!? are you INSANE!?"
[0:46:20] <%AncelDeLambert> she is big strong
[0:46:24] <majima666> "my dad would beat your dad up" literally
[0:46:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @0dokuro kiryu's done this time tho? I thought the new yakuza was gonna have someone else?
[0:46:30] <Ner234> @ScreamingMeat "Oh my shit"
[0:46:35] <circular7> ow
[0:46:35] <InugamiTheHound> @ThatGuyfromMars yup. Rooster teeth today had nice live stream of halo 3 MP today.
[0:46:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> In fact, Haruka contributes to beating that guy's ass
[0:46:39] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Kiryu is basically Japanese John wick And Haruka is the dog.
[0:46:40] <%Divryne> DEAD.
[0:46:42] <Reireizei> Dead
[0:46:43] <%Divryne> NECK SNAPPED.
[0:46:47] <robertoci3> kiryu is not a killer btw
[0:46:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I actually find it kind of odd that Justice is going to be in the same continuity
[0:46:50] <TheNewJapanGuy> Haruka has been kidnapped four (4) times or more...
[0:46:52] <+zenraider> guys im stuck in an error loop with new smash update
[0:46:52] <tj_timbs> dragon engine is p aight, but i miss the styles
[0:46:57] <%NWR_James> The best part of Y5 is Akiyama realizing the bad guys fucked up dragging Kiryu into it
[0:46:58] <phatballlz54> the dragon engine is fucking majestic
[0:46:59] <TReaperx1> dragon engine gives some FUNNY ASS ragdolls
[0:46:59] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Those hive mind arm movements really freak me out.
[0:46:59] <%ShaneWhite> @AngriestPat I’m watching some other people’s stream and they can’t successfully download Joker! I’m guessing there to many people trying to download at the same time. LOL
[0:47:02] <%spiritofmojave> It's okay, that guy has a reinforced neck he's not dead

[0:47:32] <%GoldeNOVA> Someone was making some tea
[0:47:32] <InugamiTheHound> why is there a random boiling kettle?
[0:47:33] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Ilpala271) (warning)
[0:47:33] <%shiplord13> We need a Kiryu kill count here

[0:47:35] <AMajorTom> #BOiLED
[0:47:36] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> For street tea
[0:47:36] <SailingSaturn> Worse than Murder cird
[0:47:36] <%snow_bush> Remember, Kiryu never kills
[0:47:37] <%vaporousTippler> That shit went in the lungs.
[0:47:38] <SailingSaturn> cirD
[0:47:39] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat It's actually into his solar plexus, he unloads. Then he just smaks em with the butt of the gun for good measure.
[0:47:39] <KasiCrafter> It boiled because he's just that Kiryu hot.
[0:47:39] <%PaladinDupre> Fred Fuchs?
[0:47:40] <Mr_Strut> Kiryu has never killed anyone and doesn't know what sex is.
[0:47:41] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> OH SHIT is this scene where in the english original he goes 'who's ready to get fucked up' and it's stupid as hell and messes with the mood?
[0:47:41] <+Dre_> WAIT isnt it winter how is it still boiling when its outside
[0:47:41] <Desertfishing> death stranding delayed forever
[0:47:42] <%0dokuro> @ThatGuyfromMars The new one is going to have a new protagonist, but let be honest they wont keep Kiryu out of the limelight for long.
[0:47:42] <OhioNitsud> the kettle was an abandoned orphaned given a purpose by you Pat
[0:47:42] <phatballlz54> Kiryu "Zero kills" Kazuma
[0:47:44] <rhus> This song in particular slaps SourPls
[0:47:44] <+Deano8817> kiwami's soundtrack is super underwhelming tbh
[0:47:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> 6 also has Beat Kitano and that's the coolest
[0:47:49] <circular7> CurseLit
[0:47:50] <Ner234> This theme is hype. Anyone know the song name?
[0:47:51] <Nekros4442> Yakuza 4 is just.....great
[0:47:52] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Boss rush PogChamp
[0:47:54] <TReaperx1> yakuza 6 got best soundtracks
[0:47:56] <alexandrecau> Like dragon engine heat move can be vicious as hell
[0:47:58] <r_Foeburden87> so only 2 and 6 on that engine?
[0:48:03] <tj_timbs> yes
[0:48:03] <%Omegaanimus> Beat Kitano designed the greatest video game ever
[0:48:04] <rosemon5001> we know we watched the old lp
[0:48:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @0dokuro you never know, it all depends on how the new yakuza sells
[0:48:04] <icantstopthescreams> @AngriestPat When does Kiryu eat god and ascend to hell
[0:48:05] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat There's a Heat Move in Y6 where he takes a katana and slams it through their body and then slashes it out through the side
[0:48:05] <majima666> i do hope we get the remasters
[0:48:06] <TReaperx1> yup
[0:48:08] <+jazzcrasher> Did Pat finish the Majima everywhere system yet?
[0:48:12] <televisedrevolting> Anyone know when Joker is available?
[0:48:12] <phatballlz54> akiyama's is the best
[0:48:13] <majima666> just release them as one package
[0:48:16] <%Ilpala271> they're using the same animations I can't
[0:48:20] <OhioNitsud> Saejima was fun to use in 4
[0:48:21] <%maskedriderhero> @r_Foeburden87 No, I think 5 is also dragon engine
[0:48:23] <reiju_22> akiyama Kreygasm
[0:48:25] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Ono D:
[0:48:28] <Panquake25> Zero's battle theme is one of the best fight songs I've ever heard
[0:48:29] <%TiE_Dawnbreaker> TiE_Dawnbreaker subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:48:31] <+Sulfur_Boride> The heat move with the gun is Kiryu actually into his solar plexus, he unloads. Then he just feels it necessary smacks em with the gun for good measure.
[0:48:32] <Nekros4442> The best part of Yakuza 4 is the part right before the actual final boss fights
[0:48:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> @televisedrevolt now
[0:48:36] <+Promessa_EX> why do these mobs have just enough honor for 5v1 and no more
[0:48:39] <majima666> 5 is the same engine as this. it was on ps3

[0:49:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Two things, at what point in the series does the crowd start taking bets every time Kiryu fights, and at what part do they stop betting on him to lose, and start betting on the other guys to LAST
[0:49:09] <+frontlinecaster> Kiryu hates crime

[0:53:34] <omen_setter> people are being mean to kiryu
[0:53:40] <leole11> pat is getting his shit kicked in
[0:53:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NOT KILL
[0:53:44] <%0dokuro> "Rubber Bullets"
[0:53:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> You just got gunned in the balls
[0:53:51] <OhioNitsud> Kiryu has never killed
[0:53:54] <Dral54> But what about the waiter?
[0:53:57] <BunnyEmperor> it is not the Yakuza way Kappa
[0:53:57] <AMajorTom> Crimes are not the Yakoozie way
[0:53:58] <+cvp5127> airsoft guns
[0:53:58] <+Promessa_EX> kill them just a little bit
[0:53:59] <%AncelDeLambert> commit crimes and kill?! that would be wrong.
[0:54:00] <alcors_wisdom> but even touching an unregistered gun is super illegal in japan
[0:54:06] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Suits are horrible for mobility
[0:54:08] <Flame_Water> NANI!!!!!!!
[0:54:08] <%spiritofmojave> True Yakuza NEVER KILL
[0:54:08] <icantstopthescreams> But firing a gun in public and fighting in public is a crime itself tho
[0:54:09] <ShichiNoBushi> That one Chinese guy was just keeping all his kechup packets in his shirt.
[0:54:10] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Kiryu never killed nobody :)
[0:54:15] <Dral54> That was the BEST
[0:54:20] <%shiplord13> Remember that car chases where Kiryu shot a those people and made their cars catch rubber fire
[0:54:24] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat Wait, it's not fun to slam people on their fucking craniums or break their necks?
[0:54:24] <%dave323dave> GOD that was so dumb I loved it
[0:54:25] <+Toppunchpoopbob> 26 Counts Saejima PogChamp
[0:54:28] <omen_setter> those were rubber explosions
[0:54:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> What about the rubber rocket launchers in the highway chases?
[0:54:30] <emillionghost> saejima never killed anyone. prison 40 yrs
[0:54:30] <%Toynota10> I hate this song
[0:54:33] <%Das_Bass> what about that time he beat up 2 tigers
[0:54:36] <Dral54> The fact that its used MULTIPLE times makes it work
[0:54:37] <%0dokuro> Remember when that Rubber Bullet went through someones shoulder? Crazy
[0:54:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 26 Rubber Bullets Saejima
[0:54:38] <%Gatzarlok> Dude majima has a skill where he just snaps your neck... Never kills anyone though.
[0:54:40] <%DK_Rance> i remember the rubber bullets LUL it still makes no sense how they acted like they were dead after a rubber bullet
[0:54:50] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> We should have the reverse of that where the bullets are real
[0:55:02] <majima666> the tiger punch is still the most badass thing ever
[0:55:03] <MoulesFritz> remember that time kiryuu blew up like 30 cars and a helicopter at.age 19
[0:55:04] <+MrRabbles> remember when majima had no qualms about killing a guy earlier in this game
[0:55:05] <+Promessa_EX> why go out of your way to put rubber bullets in your illegal gun
[0:55:08] <Zombrocom> That XP though
[0:55:09] <odiemikes> stando powah
[0:55:11] <phatballlz54> @AngriestPat i been meaning to ask... what did you think about haruka's "gameplay" in Yakuza 5?
[0:55:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Japan doesnt know how bullets work LUL
[0:55:16] <Desertfishing> rubber bullets fucking hurt
[0:55:16] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Rubber bullets still hurt like FUCK
[0:55:18] <icantstopthescreams> @AngriestPat Literally half the moves your doing would totally kill people
[0:55:20] <majima666> just punches it right in its fucking face
[0:55:22] <%Tearonex> SAEGEMA IS A HERO
[0:55:23] <zepelinnn> iirc it was part of the plant o act that way tho
[0:55:25] <%ilasper1> monkaS

[0:55:55] <%shiplord13> Date, why aren't you wearing pants?
[0:55:56] <AlasterAngelo> Dante?

[0:55:56] <%spiritofmojave> WHO'S POLICING
[0:55:56] <alexandrecau> you failed Dilf Date you

[0:56:23] <+zenraider> soo did anyone get joker yet?
[0:56:23] <$shurtal> cheer500 Hey Pat, you hear about the guy in Missassauga that dressed up like a delivery guy with a large package and talked to a woman on her porch then shot her with the CROSSBOW THAT WAS IN THE PACKAGE? Which begs the question - Would you rather have a package get delivered with free crossbow bolt to the chest, or Purolator, Ups, et al continuing to be lazy assholes and driving around the block twice before declaring you to be undeliverable?
[0:56:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The kid is your girlfriend? Kappa
[0:56:28] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> :(
[0:56:30] <%shiplord13> My former fiancees kid
[0:56:32] <OhioNitsud> man, i'd like to have a big bowl of this ramen
[0:56:33] <derekwst3> what pat has a kid?
[0:56:36] <%Futurecity10> Kiriyu's not allowed to reproduce. His kid would be a god
[0:56:38] <%shiplord13> Life is hard for Kiryu
[0:56:38] <%Shikari21> Kiryu got cucked
[0:56:40] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Well Yumi and Kiryu were never a thing
[0:56:40] <AlasterAngelo> Wife's boyfriend's daughter
[0:56:42] <dekkitout> She's practically Kiryu's X-23
[0:56:42] <%Gatzarlok> "I just killed 30 dudes in the street, better get some ramen."
[0:56:43] <+phatmac16> My wife's son

[0:56:57] <beltedham> What about thebaby
[0:56:57] <Desertfishing> poor elmo
[0:56:58] <alcors_wisdom> kiryu basically got cucked by a politician while he was in jail so he takes revenge by raising his daughter as his own
[0:56:59] <InugamiTheHound> that was a beef bowl not ramen
[0:57:00] <%ShovelJustice21> apatElmo

[0:57:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Graignant?
[0:57:52] <$SGrim> @emillionghost yes, but his lack of emotional strength and ability to get over Yumi fucks him up.
[0:57:53] <+Promessa_EX> feelings are important in japanertainment
[0:57:54] <majindusto> FUCK YOU...3 IS GREAT!
[0:57:54] <phatballlz54> one thing i like about Kiwami over 0 is the ability to save anywhere you want
[0:57:57] <+Toppunchpoopbob> The Billion yen Girl
[0:58:02] <%0dokuro> oh no, airsoft guns!
[0:58:03] <Nekros4442> people gonna be super upset at the future of the Yakuza series if they dont like Haruka
[0:58:06] <%Das_Bass> I like that mod with her in 5 that lets her fight @AngriestPat
[0:58:07] <AlasterAngelo> Haruka gets worse and dumber as the series goes on
[0:58:12] <dekkitout> "Get down- and take notes on how to deal with multiple armed assailants"
[0:58:17] <%Niney_Who> Oh no. Guns
[0:58:18] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> He’s always so angry lookin
[0:58:20] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat When will we get the true sequel where Haruka learns break dance fighting from Majima
[0:58:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Shes the centerpoint besides Kiryu
[0:58:28] <OhioNitsud> Haruka pissed me off at the end of 5
[0:58:28] <roflwaffleauthoritah> Haruka's so underutilised in 6 sadly
[0:58:29] <%maskedriderhero> thats a funny image
[0:58:33] <%0dokuro> Fighting the Matrix

[0:58:57] <%AncelDeLambert> secret agents that use knives
[0:58:58] <phatballlz54> you mean the best playable character in yakuza 5?
[0:59:03] <AlasterAngelo> 5 and 6 murdered Haruka's character
[0:59:06] <%Das_Bass> don't you fight the CIA in 3?
[0:59:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu has skin sewn out of flak jackets
[0:59:18] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat Haruka, Nanako, or Clementine?
[0:59:31] <%0dokuro> Yup
[0:59:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YES
[0:59:32] <%maskedriderhero> Dragon Style has an unlock that makes you immune to bullet stagger

[0:59:41] <redial_nick> it's this gauntlet, my favorite /s.
[0:59:42] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat What sucked about 3? Was it the low damage output against bosses, where you had no damage upgrades available?
[0:59:43] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> No
[0:59:46] <majima666> the schee-ai-aye!!!
[0:59:46] <%MagickBurritoh> NINJA AGENTS
[0:59:48] <BunnyEmperor> Complete... global... saturation...
[0:59:52] <starotter70> who speaks english
[0:59:52] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat He doesn't have the animation in later games cause he built up his immunity to bullet by getting shot so much in this one
[0:59:55] <%Ascethetic> wow, the smash download server is broke
[0:59:57] <%0dokuro> Kiryu punches a boulder on top of a mountain too
[0:59:57] <%AncelDeLambert> KIRYU, have sex with my sister, please, continue on our name!
[0:59:58] <derekwst3> 2spooky3me
[0:59:59] <%Das_Bass> I love these games
[1:00:05] <AlasterAngelo> 3 is better than Kiwami 1 tbh
[1:00:08] <VritraReiRei> Their knees should be DESTROYED
[1:00:10] <odiemikes> complete global saturation lines up with Wesker's core values
[1:00:10] <%Shribe> Shribe subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:00:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man the eshop is getting fucked right now
[1:00:12] <dekkitout> Ah geez, the Chris-posting is back
[1:00:13] <alcors_wisdom> im glad this guy with a gun jumped down to fist fight me
[1:00:16] <Ner234> Frames?
[1:00:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Chrisposting never stopped
[1:00:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Daigo fucked up again
[1:00:27] <+ChestMimik> Joker so OP Nintendo got destroyed
[1:00:28] <Nekros4442> We should play Isshin just for the "karaoke"
[1:00:30] <roflwaffleauthoritah> wasn't the western release gutted for 3?
[1:00:32] <omen_setter> I like the substory in Kiwami 2 that's basically an apology for 3
[1:00:33] <phatballlz54> the worst thing about 3 is the amount of damage you do to the enemies
[1:00:34] <majindusto> NO, PAT.._JUST NO
[1:00:35] <majima666> it would have been nice to go back to okinawa again. they brought back osaka a ton of times
[1:00:36] <SailingSaturn> cirREE (I have no idea what we're talking about)
[1:00:36] <reonome> WHAT
[1:00:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Real estate? Get Nugget in the office.
[1:00:42] <%shiplord13> Kiryu knows a lot about real estate
[1:00:43] <%ECRead> @ThatGuyfromMars ok thought it was just me
[1:00:43] <%El_Desperad0> That's a popular opinion, Pat
[1:00:45] <derekwst3> usa, usa, usa
[1:00:46] <%MelBrooksKA> USA! USA! USA!
[1:00:49] <rhus> HIS AMERICAN CIA BROTHER
[1:00:52] <+Deano8817> I adore the orphanage tbh
[1:00:56] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat WOOOOw they actually let u fire guns in this game o.o
[1:01:01] <+tigerfang86> most of 3's main plot is lmaooooo
[1:01:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ECRead nah, I was able to buy joker but not download him, I got the update tho
[1:01:06] <%zanzibar_junker> Agreed
[1:01:07] <%spiritofmojave> The orphanage is another critical thing to the series, you don't like it you're not gonna have a good feeling for it later in the series
[1:01:07] <rhus> fuck 3 is goofy
[1:01:09] <majindusto> NO FUN ALLOWED
[1:01:11] <+ChestMimik> Are these guys really Missing In Action Agents?
[1:01:13] <majima666> lmfao, oh god i forgot about the evil cia dad brother lmao
[1:01:19] <+tigerfang86> Lame Guy
[1:01:19] <%Das_Bass> that's why 2 and 4 are better
[1:01:19] <alexandrecau> the police girl from 2 get super shafted in 3 too
[1:01:24] <%gespenst25> @AngriestPat Does Haruka always call Kiryu-can Ojisan? Poor oldman.
[1:01:27] <majindusto> MINE IS GREAT
[1:01:27] <BunnyEmperor> so he is fighting in a wheelchair?
[1:01:28] <OhioNitsud> still want to play 3
[1:01:30] <%clausover> is it me or are frames dropping
[1:01:30] <Daxalog> Are the frames only dropping on my end?
[1:01:30] <%0dokuro> More reason why Zero is best
[1:01:31] <%Dr_DangerPhD> that dude getting wrecked by a sledgehammer to protect a doghouse is ridiculous in yakuza 3 lol
[1:01:32] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> I like to remember my evil gang members
[1:01:33] <Nekros4442> 3's main story is like if I made a mafia story in highschool
[1:01:33] <%DestroyerDJ8> i remember the guy you fight in the love hotel, but thats honestly it
[1:01:34] <%shiplord13> So he is a bad guy
[1:01:35] <californaya> Sol Badguy?
[1:01:36] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Best final boss is in 2
[1:01:38] <AlasterAngelo> sol badguy
[1:01:41] <CrypticMochi> Not funny stupid like 4, but just stupid?
[1:01:47] <%shiplord13> sobadguy?
[1:01:52] <%0dokuro> Majima development in Zero was good
[1:01:53] <mysterious_chicken> Actually, I agree with you. Seeing Kiryu interact with the kids was honestly kinda refreshing
[1:01:57] <%ECRead> @ThatGuyfromMars I bought the pass an hour or so ago but haven't even been able to update lol
[1:02:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kiryu had a hard life :(
[1:02:01] <+tigerfang86> sleepy kiryu
[1:02:04] <+tigerfang86> FeelsBadMan

[1:17:30] <切捨御免> He's a loyal soldier
[1:17:36] <%Gatzarlok> If kiryu doesn't who will?
[1:17:37] <%AncelDeLambert> "I'm the only one who fucks with the Tojo"
[1:17:37] <%dukenux> JUST when he thought he's out, they pull him RIGHT IN
[1:17:38] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> But the tojo
[1:17:39] <%MelBrooksKA> Is Nishki dead?
[1:17:41] <+Toppunchpoopbob> When the Tojo Clan gets into trouble. Kiryu: 'Aw shit, here we go again'
[1:17:42] <SilverFaustX> Japanese are loyal
[1:17:45] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Well that checks out, @ChestMimik
[1:17:45] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat it's because he dragged Daigo in and feels bad for it
[1:17:48] <%weissguard> Remember in Yakuza 0 when Kiryu gets shot and is downed for the rest of the scene? Only for him to get bandaged and pain killered up in the next scene? LUL
[1:17:50] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat wait...that wound shows the bullet obly graced him. so it went through so wouldnt had hit the girl??
[1:17:50] <%Kirijuo> 6 actually explains why
[1:17:53] <+ThatHomestar> don't be mean to diago
[1:17:53] <HeadsHeldHigh> angery haruka
[1:17:53] <+frontlinecaster> Yeah like in all honesty, The Omi Alliance treats him better
[1:17:53] <%spiritofmojave> Because there's no way the Tojo philosophy on BIG CRIMES could be inherently flawed
[1:17:54] <+tigerfang86> Daigo is REALLY BAD at this
[1:17:56] <TheNewJapanGuy> Kiryu is the only guy who can sort the mess that is the Tojo Clan.

[1:18:08] <+Dull_Fangs> Diago didn't seem that bad in 2
[1:18:09] <leole11> @Luesagna00 he shoulder checked the bullet out of the way, duh
[1:18:09] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I've always taken it as, "I have to save my daddy's legacy!" Same reason I think he even bothered with the orphanage. rooShrug
[1:18:10] <+Dreek93> he can't stop seeing Daigo as a little kid from zero he has to help raise

[1:20:48] <%connos_livereview> NAAAHNI
[1:20:48] <alcors_wisdom> i mean he could but then the bomb supposedly goes off
[1:20:50] <%Gatzarlok> Honestly? That's a pretty long shot for hand gun calibers.
[1:20:52] <+Deano8817> the bullet disappears after a certain range, they can't possibly hit
[1:20:52] <%Thechiefin> Where did the bomb come from I completely forgot about that
[1:20:53] <CybertronPrime> Is it just me, or does it seem like a lot of Yakuza big bads are either Chinese or Korean?

[1:21:58] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Oh yeah that guy
[1:21:59] <Dral54> It says 'bukkake' trust me, im Japan
[1:22:05] <OhioNitsud> replace the will with a red bull can

[1:22:27] <+tigerfang86> YEAH
[1:22:27] <Josef_Stryker> Still have to wonder why Kiryu thought Daigo was a good pick
[1:22:28] <Nekros4442> Well they have to be terrible or else Kiryu has to stay as a babysitter
[1:22:28] <%joylent_blue> Listen...

[1:22:34] <+Dreek93> isn't that a whole quest line in 0?
[1:22:34] <+Weeewer> I thought Sera was alright
[1:22:34] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat To be fair, one of those was because he dragged him into the Yakuza and then kinda left him to flounder
[1:22:34] <worldbrand> PogChamp
[1:22:34] <InugamiTheHound> daddy and sera the only good leaders?
[1:22:35] <%GoldeNOVA> Time to stop making decisions buddy, ok?

[1:22:39] <Desertfishing> mind blown
[1:22:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So, the Yakuza who doesn't do crime sucks at picking crime bosses? Who would have thought it.
[1:22:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> Dun dun DUUUUUUUN
[1:22:41] <%dukenux> Kiryu is pretty bad at everything that isn't beating people
[1:22:41] <rhus> Tbh, I’m surprised Sera didn’t just pick Kiryu himself, considering 0
[1:22:42] <+Dull_Fangs> fuck this part
[1:22:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> sbfpOmg
[1:22:43] <%spiritofmojave> Sera had some ethics, but then became a shit--Daigo is trash tho
[1:22:43] <Nekros4442> Kiryu is Naruto's dad?
[1:22:43] <+Deano8817> he's a YAKUZA KIWAMI
[1:22:45] <%SaltyDongs> Biggest Yakuza

[1:22:53] <+oni_santoryu> He is the best for real estate
[1:22:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Now it's time to BEAT ALL YOUR ASSES
[1:22:57] <+tigerfang86> He's the Kiwami-est yakuza now
[1:22:57] <+frontlinecaster> It's pretty bad here yeah
[1:22:59] <tj_timbs> Kiryu IS Yakuza
[1:23:00] <%dukenux> Truly we are Kiwami
[1:23:01] <flame_of_udun_> This part bloooooows
[1:23:02] <+Deano8817> oh it's fucking horrible alirght
[1:23:03] <+Dull_Fangs> its awful
[1:23:05] <burgersteel> no gun can defeat a chairman
[1:23:06] <godzookylives> Truly Kiryu is the Yakuza Kiwami
[1:23:06] <+frontlinecaster> This is so much worse than the final boss
[1:23:09] <%gespenst25> Haven't you ever heard? Right makes might.
[1:23:09] <%templar010> He has gained BURNING yakuza big power from his criminal promotion
[1:23:10] <circular7> Sera wasn't all that bad was he?
[1:23:11] <starotter70> It's not great
[1:23:12] <%Toynota10> How do those guys not all have guns?
[1:23:12] <+MrRabbles> i wish they gave kiryu a boss title card there
[1:23:13] <ShreddingPixels> I'd say Shimano fight 1 is the worst.
[1:23:14] <tj_timbs> yeah, wait till you actually PLAY this fight
[1:23:14] <prime_name> I barely remember this fight.
[1:23:15] <alexandrecau> IT's bad but you have rush mode
[1:23:17] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> He’s now leaking barny gas
[1:23:19] <%gespenst25> Kono Kiryu da!
[1:23:22] <+frontlinecaster> NEVER KILLED A MAN
[1:23:22] <%castcode> Not dead
[1:23:23] <%shiplord13> Kiryu achieves the power of the Chairman title
[1:23:23] <WillyFresh992> nerfed beast mode so hard after zero
[1:23:24] <tj_timbs> oh BOY
[1:23:24] <%snow_bush> @AngriestPat Nugget, fifth chairmen
[1:23:26] <omen_setter> Kiryu's picks for chairman always baffled the fuck out of me
[1:23:27] <phatballlz54> it is bullshitingly unfair
[1:23:28] <alexandrecau> compared to it's bad but you have nothing
[1:23:29] <%Gatzarlok> Chairman Upgrade comes with a +50% protection to bullets
[1:23:37] <+tigerfang86> that's not a good look sera!
[1:23:37] <alexandrecau> He was waiting
[1:23:37] <%Toynota10> it wasn't that tough
[1:23:40] <%joylent_blue> nah he was just faking it
[1:23:41] <+Deano8817> he did ALRIGHT
[1:23:43] <%spiritofmojave> He just wanted to watch
[1:23:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Nugget for life, I'll follow him forever!
[1:23:49] <outis94> you gotta do what you gotta do pat
[1:23:49] <Rhinoprotoss> Rubber bullets
[1:23:52] <Nekros4442> Sera did better than Daigo at least
[1:23:54] <bigbradish> Whats wrong with Daigo I like him
[1:23:54] <+Dull_Fangs> God when are the PS3 games going to come to the PS4
[1:23:54] <%bread_assassin> He didn't do it, though, so it's fine.
[1:23:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @AngriestPat This is the best part, everyone from here onwards and even in the sequel, acknowledges him as the 4th Chairman even though he was like that for a day. A DAY. And they act like his role as chairman was legendary.
[1:23:59] <%joylent_blue> he was faking it to himself
[1:23:59] <%MagickBurritoh> He was putting on a show for nobody
[1:24:00] <HeadsHeldHigh> Point blank rubber bullets
[1:24:12] <+Toppunchpoopbob> He was faking it to see if Kazuma was loyal Kappa
[1:24:12] <+tigerfang86> MORE COPTERS
[1:24:13] <+RayDaug> Rubber Gun
[1:24:16] <thebehatted> oh my god are you gonna beat up the helicopters
[1:24:17] <$Mendin> But can Kiryu fight... A HIND-D?
[1:24:17] <starotter70> You don't know that until you try
[1:24:17] <Triox45> punch the bullets
[1:24:18] <+frontlinecaster> I will punch all of the helicopters
[1:24:20] <alexandrecau> @bigbradish he is way over his head as chairman, Kiryu pretty much fucked him over
[1:24:20] <+chimaera24> Kiryu should've made Nugget the next chairmen
[1:24:21] <dekkitout> Is he about fight ATTACK HELICOPTERS!?
[1:24:22] <%AncelDeLambert> that is teh WORST laugh, man
[1:24:22] <lloyddboy> HAW AH AH AH AH
[1:24:24] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat That baby new how to sell an injury
[1:24:25] <alcors_wisdom> the entirety of yakuza is a secrete WWE plot line that no one told kiryu about
[1:24:26] <%Gatzarlok> He was faking it in front of Haruka to look like a tough guy, not a god.
[1:24:26] <%Ilpala271> METAL GEAR?!
[1:24:26] <+frontlinecaster> Yeah this fight sucks ass
[1:24:27] <a_mad_dragon> babies are basically rubber too though

[1:24:34] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Music is great here though
[1:24:35] <InugamiTheHound> only pistols!

[1:25:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> They wanna kung fu fight
[1:25:28] <%Niney_Who> Where did they JUMP FROM
[1:25:29] <BunnyEmperor> Out of range LUL
[1:25:29] <starotter70> GET Back Here You Son Of A BITCH!
[1:25:31] <+ChestMimik> "Griffith did nothing wrong" says Griffith while machine-gunning at the LAPD
[1:25:31] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu can dodge bullets though
[1:25:31] <flame_of_udun_> Fuck this fight so hard
[1:25:31] <%castcode> That poor plant
[1:25:32] <alexandrecau> too far and bad aim
[1:25:33] <%Laecerelius> Holy shit

[1:25:36] <%gespenst25> Knife. Gun. Knifegun
[1:25:37] <%shiplord13> Kiryu vs the Special Forces
[1:25:40] <+Shindeil> Kappa
[1:25:40] <dekkitout> Be real, Kiryu would tank those shots like a Kiryu
[1:25:40] <$RaikenTB> LUL
[1:25:42] <+MrRabbles> gun is a strong style
[1:25:42] <%Gatzarlok> I mean.. SURELY only those 2 cops know he's wanted, it's not like they have some sort of filing system or record oh wait.
[1:25:42] <majima666> they're japanese, they have honoue
[1:25:44] <VritraReiRei> Out of Ammo! :D
[1:25:46] <+HellCopter> no the guns cost $7 and it would do more damage if you threw the bullets
[1:25:46] <+miguelrod777> kiryus immune to bullets he sees coming
[1:25:47] <@Fuggins4U> all these dudes are missing in action
[1:25:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Those guys in uniform? Not part of my crew. Just random people off the street.
[1:25:48] <rhus> This fight is the WORST
[1:25:49] <OhioNitsud> that was good strategy pushing that plant into the fight
[1:25:52] <%spiritofmojave> Japanese FBI exist in another dimension
[1:25:52] <切捨御免> oh god this is like the yakuza 4 last fight but worse
[1:25:53] <ScreamingMeat> Kiryu is bullet resistant
[1:25:53] <flame_of_udun_> You can just taste the 2005 here
[1:25:56] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> They're using rubber bullets, their fists and knives are more effective
[1:25:57] <+tigerfang86> GIVE EM THE TREE
[1:25:59] <alcors_wisdom> also why do these elite beat badass government agents only carry pistols
[1:26:00] <+Weeewer> Its not as bad as the first fight with Shimano
[1:26:00] <%wvuboii> PLANT
[1:26:01] <%Edgy_Macaroon> they need to kill you fairly
[1:26:03] <+Weeewer> That fight is garbo
[1:26:03] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat They have to buy their own bullets and didn't want to waste them
[1:26:03] <HeadsHeldHigh> Ah yes, the best weapon, TREE
[1:26:04] <Viperwing999> GTA TREE
[1:26:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> in the original ps2 version this bossfight sucked ass, if you didn't come into it with a bunch of healing items you had zero chance
[1:26:07] <%AncelDeLambert> now pick up the lion
[1:26:10] <+frontlinecaster> Take the gun
[1:26:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Extremely trained special forces vs. One Yakuzee Boi
[1:26:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Git'em, Simba!
[1:26:13] <BunnyEmperor> Ooof
[1:26:14] <+Fynale> yeah i mean if i saw a guy just raw pick up a marble planter i'd not run toward them and shoot them
[1:26:20] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Marble pot will always defeat ~GUN
[1:26:24] <+frontlinecaster> I just used a katana and heat moves on this fight
[1:26:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Y'know I'm genuinely curious if intent is a chargeable offense in Japan
[1:26:25] <%Gatzarlok> Luckily energy drinks counter guns.
[1:26:28] <%AncelDeLambert> guns are fucking AWFUL
[1:26:28] <%castcode> Good Lord
[1:26:28] <$RaikenTB> This music is so out of place LUL
[1:26:28] <circular7> now put your guns away and take out your knifes Kappa
[1:26:33] <%dukenux> Tricksworroyalgun
[1:26:33] <%Niney_Who> This is the worst fight in the series via Devilleon
[1:26:34] <Rhinoprotoss> Get gudd
[1:26:36] <alexandrecau> kiwami 2 had one good fight with a gun
[1:26:37] <HeadsHeldHigh> Kiryu's spine is adamantium
[1:26:39] <flame_of_udun_> Man Japanese SWAT sucks
[1:26:42] <starotter70> It's almost as if they need to nerf guns
[1:26:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> A HIND D
[1:26:48] <BunnyEmperor> LEFT HAND RULE
[1:26:49] <%AncelDeLambert> haha, this Monster has made me bulletproof!
[1:26:53] <@Fuggins4U> get to the choppa. and punch it
[1:26:54] <TLPenn> I hope Pat experiences all the Persona fanservice in Smash before the next podcast.
[1:26:55] <+stupid_neko21> ok...am i crazy? cuz i thought you could just completely ignore everyone and run to jingu. but i'm probably remembering wrong. cuz i wanted to block this fight out of my mind
[1:26:56] <AmericanaRed> BIGBOI 1
[1:26:56] <%castcode> Jingu pls
[1:26:56] <+tigerfang86> LATER NERD
[1:26:57] <Bonbie> "Block bullets automatically" That's a hell of a powerup
[1:26:58] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> Pat.......attack the ranged people first......*please.*
[1:26:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Now, to drink a Redbull and become INVINCIBLE!!!
[1:26:59] <%snow_bush> No evidence.
[1:26:59] <+Dull_Fangs> man its so weird to think of this movement as part of a one shot game and not the catalyst of a massive series
[1:27:00] <OhioNitsud> helicoptah powah!
[1:27:00] <+cicatjb> its pretty true to scale tbh
[1:27:02] <majima666> colnel whats a japanese gunship doing here?
[1:27:05] <+Quigsies> Never before has the villain escaping on a helicopter looked so lame
[1:27:06] <%MagickBurritoh> He just got shot in the head
[1:27:06] <dekkitout> I want Kiryu to suplex that helicopter
[1:27:07] <%shiplord13> Still no evidence
[1:27:08] <Zebroneath> That's the size of practically a passenger plane.
[1:27:09] <flame_of_udun_> Goddamnit Jingu no one likes you
[1:27:10] <%Ilpala271> YOU DiDN'T WIN
[1:27:16] <+Dull_Fangs> it sure does feel like the former in retrospect
[1:27:17] <%spiritofmojave> Radiating with apatBig evil energy
[1:27:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Best Boss Fight
[1:27:19] <%Idziman> is Jingu a Call of Duty villain?
[1:27:20] <starotter70> 4Heads HAW HAW HAW 4Heads
[1:27:22] <%dukenux> I want Kiryu to beat people with that helicopter
[1:27:22] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Remember how this dude just sorta fucking ate it in the movie when his chopper got shot down with an RPG and he never actually confronted anyone
[1:27:23] <+ChestMimik> Imagine running into CQC while wielding a silenced pistol
[1:27:24] <ShreddingPixels> Knives and guns are the worst.
[1:27:24] <%AncelDeLambert> sir, sir. You appear to be on fire
[1:27:26] <%Laecerelius> SOLDERI! Protect those energy drinks!
[1:27:27] <切捨御免> yo those goons have real heat
[1:27:29] <ManlyMcBeefington> is MIA Ministry of Internal Affairs in Japan?
[1:27:31] <%castcode> Yeah this is pretty painful
[1:27:32] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Dude fight is EZ you just bayd Kappa
[1:27:32] <roflwaffleauthoritah> they kinda make this fight again in 6 but it's way better (and stupider)
[1:27:33] <%MelBrooksKA> Look at those fart gas men
[1:27:34] <phatballlz54> this is fair
[1:27:34] <%Laecerelius> Make sure Kiryu doesn't get them!
[1:27:35] <OhioNitsud> LUL
[1:27:36] <alcors_wisdom> i mean does it really matter if jingu leaves? he cant get the money now and hes apparently going to get ousted by the cops
[1:27:37] <%Toynota10> hey everyone maintenance will b done by 1000
[1:27:38] <%spiritofmojave> This is the worst in the series
[1:27:40] <circular7> let me fly 30 feet away...
[1:27:41] <+Fynale> Beast style should just tank the bullets
[1:27:43] <%spiritofmojave> Or atleast up there
[1:27:45] <Jrockoni> i would not be surprised if someone told the badguy in one of these games summons a god damn AC130

[1:28:23] <BunnyEmperor> The stagger tho
[1:28:23] <+frontlinecaster> @AngriestPat Do you have any swords/weapons?
[1:28:25] <Panquake25> zombie shooter spin-offs aside
[1:28:25] <Ion_Laser> hold on. Hold on. Hold On. HOLD ON
[1:28:28] <ManlyMcBeefington> @frontlinecaster that's 2 nouns, weird
[1:28:28] <InugamiTheHound> this looks like japan mixed with CS game
[1:28:31] <%Divryne> apatHoldon
[1:28:31] <AdmiralButtloaf> how can these yakuzi smell so bad
[1:28:31] <odiemikes> I belieb in big an stronk Pat!
[1:28:32] <%dukenux> Get rid of the GUN
[1:28:33] <starotter70> Right in the ass
[1:28:34] <%CJett92> "OW MY ASS"
[1:28:34] <+frontlinecaster> @ManlyMcBeefington Yeah it makes no sense
[1:28:36] <+Dull_Fangs> has there been any news about Shin Yakuza
[1:28:36] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I don't know why they remade this fight with all the guns
[1:28:37] <AmericanaRed> MY ONLY WEAKNESS
[1:28:37] <%gespenst25> Ow my sciatica.
[1:28:38] <Hazard_Kujacker> I dunno man Y6 Amon is the worst fight in the series in any difficulty above normal
[1:28:38] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Fight gun with gun
[1:28:38] <+frontlinecaster> It's Engrish
[1:28:40] <circular7> oh god...
[1:28:40] <%Laecerelius> Pat? Using items other thank heals?
[1:28:45] <+ChestMimik> They should have given Kiriyu a royal guard
[1:28:48] <%galaxyswirl> i found this fight super easy, then again i had maxed out dragon style
[1:28:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> The bullets are literally stacking in Kiryu's ass
[1:28:50] <%Mekhet09> If only you had tiger drop.
[1:28:50] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> I would kill for a redub mod of Kiwami using the english VA files, I don't care if it doesn't cover everything. Mark Hamil as Majima was inspired
[1:28:50] <%crimsonharvest> not dead
[1:28:53] <OhioNitsud> guy goes down to one knee and literally puts the muzzle up Kiryu's butt
[1:28:55] <切捨御免> EVERYTHING is a weapon
[1:28:58] <alexandrecau> Amon has always been bullshit
[1:28:58] <%dukenux> I wish you could kick them from the rooftop
[1:28:58] <@Fuggins4U> gun vs furniture. the ultimate deadlock
[1:28:59] <dekkitout> With beast style, everything's a weapon
[1:28:59] <flame_of_udun_> This is giving me PTSD
[1:29:00] <%Divryne> GUN
[1:29:01] <%Gatzarlok> @leole11 talk about gross incompetence am I right?

[1:29:20] <%vectorless_peon> Can you throw one or anyof them out a god damn window?
[1:29:21] <BunnyEmperor> Parry the bullet with your BARE HANDS
[1:29:21] <majima666> isnt judgement having an english dub?
[1:29:22] <@Fuggins4U> suplex the gun!
[1:29:22] <%AncelDeLambert> did the gun disappear?
[1:29:24] <+frontlinecaster> There's no good gun heat moves in this one sadly
[1:29:26] <+Fynale> what's the 4th style in this game still the dragon style?
[1:29:28] <phatballlz54> i actually cheesed this entire fight using the infinite durability bat that you get from Majima Everywhere LoL
[1:29:30] <%dukenux> Blocked with his TEETH?
[1:29:30] <+MrRabbles> majima can literally deflect a bullet with a bat
[1:29:31] <+Dull_Fangs> backdash cancel out of everything
[1:29:34] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Fuggins!
[1:29:35] <%Gatzarlok> Oh no, he has a suppressor, how will you ever know where he is?!?
[1:29:36] <Nekros4442> @majima666 that...seems like a waste of money
[1:29:37] <+Deano8817> did he get confused?? LUL
[1:29:41] <flame_of_udun_> @fynale yeah
[1:29:46] <Hazard_Kujacker> @ChestMimik Fully Upgraded Beast/Rush give you what's basically a Royal Guard
[1:29:49] <%dukenux> well Kiryu can take a bullet to the face as was demonstrated
[1:29:49] <worldbrand> this would be easier if you raced tiny cars
[1:29:53] <@Fuggins4U> @TheOnlyStrayCat Meeee!
[1:29:56] <%vectorless_peon> is this what is meant by gun katas?
[1:29:56] <AmericanaRed> PERSONA

[1:29:59] <$RaikenTB> That run LUL
[1:30:00] <circular7> did you actually try to block a gun shot Pat???
[1:30:09] <%Mekhet09> Get ready for the best fight in the game.
[1:30:12] <@Fuggins4U> he missed you too
[1:30:16] <BaronVonDickButt> This boss fight is literally making me sleepy

[1:30:20] <%Laecerelius> He was protecting that energy drink!
[1:30:23] <%joylent_blue> wow we just tricked over here i guess
[1:30:24] <%AncelDeLambert> lol teleprot
[1:30:24] <starotter70> @AngriestPat If only they replaced Jingu with Master Betty from Kung Pow, it would effectively be the same just more entertaining
[1:30:25] <+frontlinecaster> Phase 2!
[1:30:26] <alexandrecau> he was the key to the door
[1:30:27] <%Niney_Who> UH OH
[1:30:28] <%Niney_Who> WORST PART
[1:30:32] <Seraphile> sure do hope its more guys with guns
[1:30:33] <+Dull_Fangs> lets fucking go
[1:30:34] <flame_of_udun_> Just wait until the MIA colonels fucking resurrect NotLikeThis

[1:30:46] <BunnyEmperor> RED SUN OVER PARADISE
[1:30:47] <$RaikenTB> ?????
[1:30:47] <OhioNitsud> oh god, the flashbacks
[1:30:47] <NeoOneShin> why not just leave
[1:30:48] <MaxonMashville> WHY DID HE JUMP DOWN
[1:30:50] <majima666> kiryus love for energy drinks is only topped by pat
[1:30:50] <$Tamamo_No_Mae_77> What, do you fist fight the chopper too?
[1:30:51] <demegodz> Get off the helicopter
[1:30:51] <%MagickBurritoh> Why'd they pose when they could have just SHOT Kiryu
[1:30:53] <%Gatzarlok> Did he seriously take a chopper... up a whole story?
[1:30:53] <flame_of_udun_> THIS SHIT IS ASS
[1:30:53] <alcors_wisdom> rivers in a dry land
[1:30:54] <+tigerfang86> IM FUKKIN INVINCIBLE
[1:30:56] <+ChestMimik> Why did he leave the gullygully?
[1:30:56] <Jrockoni> wait why was he in the helicoptor?
[1:30:58] <Hazard_Kujacker> RUSH TRIGGER!
[1:30:59] <Rojanbo> Why isnt he picking up their guns?
[1:30:59] <%averyoddjew> wait why would he jump out of the helicopter?
[1:31:00] <+mik255> is jingu armstrong?
[1:31:01] <Nekros4442> oh god they're so slippery
[1:31:02] <Eggo1634> Welcome to hell Pat
[1:31:06] <%crimsonharvest> he gettin mad
[1:31:07] <%Spydurman> flies away in helicopter ONLY TO COME BACK AND FIGHT?????
[1:31:07] <%Divryne> OOF.
[1:31:07] <clonexsniperx> did he take a helicopter to fly 20 yards away?
[1:31:10] <applesonthemoon> dude if kiryu punched a helicopter itd be the best what are you talking about
[1:31:10] <%Niney_Who> It gets worse
[1:31:11] <+frontlinecaster> I almost rage quit this fight
[1:31:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and this isnt even Very Hard mode
[1:31:15] <TheNewJapanGuy> It would've been better had it just been Nishiki instead of Jingu
[1:31:18] <TReaperx1> this is nice
[1:31:18] <%amilie3> the best boss fight in all of yakuza apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:31:19] <starotter70> 4Head Haw Haw Haw 4Head
[1:31:19] <mayorrev> no way to dodge or block bullets?
[1:31:20] <circular7> gun-kata
[1:31:21] <AmericanaRed> use CQC
[1:31:21] <%Mekhet09> I did this on very hard.
[1:31:22] <NeoOneShin> are you sure it's the game
[1:31:24] <+mik255> to be fair this part sucked in the original too
[1:31:25] <%Mekhet09> Just to see if I could.
[1:31:25] <TheNewJapanGuy> Like in every way
[1:31:25] <OhioNitsud> my PTSD is acting up
[1:31:25] <BunnyEmperor> Jesus fuck whats with the guns
[1:31:26] <Nekros4442> Would tiger drop even help here?
[1:31:28] <%AncelDeLambert> the combat in this game could be fixed so fast by just allowing chip damage through blocks or the building of heat through blocks
[1:31:28] <%BonewheelVanguard> So it begins
[1:31:28] <VritraReiRei> can you Heat move these guys of the ledge?
[1:31:29] <+Promessa_EX> learn their gun cooldowns
[1:31:29] <%Niney_Who> LOOK AT THAT COWARD
[1:31:29] <%shiplord13> At this point they are wasting precious Helicopter fuel
[1:31:31] <flame_of_udun_> Wtf was RGG studio thinking
[1:31:33] <+Fynale> why doesn't that heat move remove his gun
[1:31:37] <%AncelDeLambert> because the feast or famine shit with heat needs to go
[1:31:39] <%galaxyswirl> i can see how this can be annoying without one ability
[1:31:44] <+MrRabbles> i just used dragon style and spammed the knife heat move cause this boss sucks
[1:31:46] <%Ilpala271> it's like fighting Miyata if Miyata brought a gun into the ring
[1:31:47] <+ThatHomestar> did pat not upgrade the dragon style?
[1:31:48] <circular7> ResidentSleeper
[1:31:50] <BunnyEmperor> Brute smarts
[1:31:50] <ScreamingMeat> If Kiryu didn't have a heart attack every time he got shot then this would be a billion times more tolerable
[1:31:52] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Should've just stocked some weapons to cheese through this part
[1:31:54] <%Mekhet09> This is whhy you get tiger drop.
[1:31:54] <+mik255> kamurocho is huge
[1:31:55] <%Divryne> WHOOF.
[1:31:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is PS2 era boss fight
[1:31:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> At least that does pretty good damage
[1:31:57] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> If you use the item that lets you grab easier and combine it with the throw damage charm with Beast this becomes trivial
[1:31:57] <%Gatzarlok> @AngriestPat Is there no equipment that blocks bullets for you?
[1:31:58] <TReaperx1> lol
[1:31:59] <worldbrand> you get disarm tech in yakuza 0, so damn
[1:32:00] <%Das_Bass> JPG city
[1:32:01] <%MagickBurritoh> You have to hit them Pat
[1:32:03] <%dukenux> Why do we fall, Kiryu-san?
[1:32:06] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Take one shot and then wait, men!
[1:32:07] <Chester_goes_Berserk> @fynale I don't think Pat did Komaki training
[1:32:07] <TReaperx1> Lol
[1:32:08] <starotter70> Sure is
[1:32:08] <alexandrecau> not in kiwami 1
[1:32:10] <WillyFresh992> just pounding energy drinks as the blood pours out of my hundreds of bullet wounds
[1:32:12] <Liquid_Dio> @thathomestar "majima everywhere bad =("
[1:32:17] <flame_of_udun_> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli thats because it IS a PS2 boss fight LUL
[1:32:19] <phatballlz54> this seems very balanced
[1:32:22] <%vectorless_peon> who trained these wackos?>
[1:32:22] <%Niney_Who> Stunlocking more like Unfunlocking
[1:32:23] <starotter70> LUL Just kick him
[1:32:23] <+frontlinecaster> There's nothing that negates bullets, there's stuff that reduces damage some.
[1:32:25] <+Dull_Fangs> don't these guards regen health
[1:32:26] <circular7> implying Pat would go near pod racing Kappa
[1:32:28] <+ThatHomestar> dragon style makes this not as frustrating, but still
[1:32:29] <%CJett92> Just fuck my shit up fam
[1:32:30] <prime_name> Did he just Naruto Run?
[1:32:31] <ovan20> It's Pat suppose to lose this fight?
[1:32:32] <OhioNitsud> make it stop...make it stop!
[1:32:34] <BunnyEmperor> This is so boring tbh
[1:32:35] <VritraReiRei> @thathomestar Pat REFUSES TO because it requires pocket racing
[1:32:38] <CrypticMochi> Popping the blue gives you extra poise right? Does that work on bullets
[1:32:39] <%Divryne> LUL
[1:32:39] <+tigerfang86> KEEP GETTING SHOT
[1:32:40] <flame_of_udun_> GUESS ILL DIE
[1:32:40] <a_mad_dragon> did i just see jingu do a ninja run
[1:32:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm just going to replace all my blood with energy drinks
[1:32:41] <starotter70> Final Boss Rush
[1:32:41] <NeoOneShin> git gud
[1:32:42] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, this is awful
[1:32:43] <%joylent_blue> i think i just used Max Staminans and heat moves them to death
[1:32:44] <+mik255> THE POWER OF GUN
[1:32:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @flame_of_udun_ i know, thats why if anyone asks why the boss fights in this are bad, theres your answer
[1:32:44] <+cvp5127> GUN is too strong
[1:32:44] <BunnyEmperor> This is really bad
[1:32:45] <%AncelDeLambert> and ALL of them have stagger moves
[1:32:47] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat yeah this seems like it's the first boss fight of a new series and they didn't know what to do to amp up the scale
[1:32:52] <majima666> the dark souls of yakuza games
[1:32:53] <+McSoliace> i think i just tiger dropped this entire boss fight when i played it
[1:32:54] <something_very_clever> Oh god this is literally the worst
[1:32:55] <starotter70> It just sucks
[1:32:56] <flame_of_udun_> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli yup lol
[1:32:57] <+ThatHomestar> i just used a guide for pocket racing lol
[1:32:59] <%Gatzarlok> Kiryu is gonna get lead poisoning before dying to a gunshot.
[1:32:59] <sukiyakiwestern> kiwami is a bad game
[1:33:01] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Reminder that fukken STAMINAN was a plot point in the movie, and it was glorious and stupid
[1:33:01] <%Niney_Who> No grabs allowed
[1:33:02] <Zilik1> The enemies always auto-dodging doesnt help either
[1:33:02] <TReaperx1> im enjoying this
[1:33:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu is already a god for tanking so many bullets
[1:33:04] <Desertfishing> this games knock down % fucking sucks asss
[1:33:05] <%dukenux> It's not a hard fight, just very annoying
[1:33:05] <%CJett92> @AngriestPat You were wrong before. THIS is the worst it'll ever be
[1:33:06] <OhioNitsud> LUL
[1:33:08] <Nekros4442> I could get it if this was just Yakuza 1..i'm more interested with how this boss fight stayed like this in the remake
[1:33:09] <+frontlinecaster> Oh right missiles
[1:33:10] <flame_of_udun_> Kiwami is severely flawed
[1:33:11] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAT
[1:33:12] <%averyoddjew> from where?
[1:33:12] <%amilie3> what are you talking about this is great
[1:33:14] <%joylent_blue> the FUCK
[1:33:18] <WillyFresh992> Jingu Fucking Naruto Runs the fuck outta the way?
[1:33:18] <majima666> hes fine though
[1:33:18] <+ChestMimik> Why do the MIA agents know how to Trickster?
[1:33:18] <%Ilpala271> I'm sorry WHAT
[1:33:18] <circular7> you did this to yourself Pat. dragon mode makes this easier
[1:33:18] <%joylent_blue> from the chopper?
[1:33:19] <%JayEarly> Is it me or is there a lot of luck involved in whether you actually hit a guy
[1:33:19] <%dukenux> That run LUL
[1:33:19] <Scyllas> Brawler sucks
[1:33:19] <tj_timbs> the good ol' missile gun
[1:33:21] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm sorry, you were shot with a WHAT?!
[1:33:23] <VritraReiRei> Took it like a CHAMP
[1:33:24] <alexandrecau> kiwami means gunshot
[1:33:25] <+frontlinecaster> Yeah this is all one fight
[1:33:25] <OhioNitsud> why!? LUL
[1:33:31] <Desertfishing> every other hit is a knock down and ruins the combat
[1:33:33] <%shiplord13> Kiryu can take it
[1:33:34] <+Fynale> that guy just tanked a punch to shoot kiryu wtf
[1:33:35] <Eggo1634> No Jingu has grenades
[1:33:35] <%AncelDeLambert> it was a ghost gun!
[1:33:35] <phatballlz54> it was jingu he throws grenades at you
[1:33:36] <flame_of_udun_> Kiwami means terrible boss fight
[1:33:39] <mayorrev> CAN YOU TAKE HIS GUN?
[1:33:40] <SomersaultJustice> HUUUUAHHH
[1:33:40] <+mik255> dont they come back?
[1:33:40] <%vectorless_peon> These guys should have all lost their guns better yet Kiryu should have a move to perminantly disarm them
[1:33:41] <TReaperx1> it WONT
[1:33:41] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Oh really? Kappa
[1:33:43] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Kiryu is bulletproof dont worry about it
[1:33:45] <dekkitout> At this point, Kiryu has been shot double the collective amount of times Archer has- and that's a fucking lot
[1:33:45] <%amilie3> easy LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:33:45] <%MagickBurritoh> HE JUST WATCHING
[1:33:48] <starotter70> Nut is it
[1:33:48] <circular7> a grenade
[1:33:50] <alexandrecau> the gun disappears
[1:33:50] <JunkyardCrow> Jingu Uzumaki LUL
[1:33:50] <%dukenux> Kiwami means [GUN]
[1:33:51] <%Toynota10> It's not so bad when you have every upgrade
[1:33:53] <critikal_bit> Kiryu's taken enough bullets to supply a small army
[1:33:53] <%AncelDeLambert> @Fynale a good plan, actually
[1:33:54] <%Tearonex> wow this literally looks like the end of yakuza 4
[1:33:54] <%dukenux> LUL
[1:33:56] <%spiritofmojave> Little easier until the next phase sugoiSmugsnake
[1:33:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He has grenades?!
[1:33:57] <%afronooch> huuuuuAAH
[1:33:58] <%meraud> LUL
[1:33:58] <+gruff_gridof> maximum fun
[1:34:00] <flame_of_udun_> Kiwami means HUUAAAH
[1:34:02] <something_very_clever> Go for Jingu like now
[1:34:04] <InugamiTheHound> take a shot every time Kiryu gets shot n this fight
[1:34:05] <$Mendin> The worst part of these endurance fights is that Heat Moves get weaker the more you use in a fight
[1:34:06] <outis94> kind wish theyd shoot then pistol whip you
[1:34:07] <%WackyXmand> I'm watching this on 160p cause my internet sucks at this looks like Yakuza 1
[1:34:07] <%MagickBurritoh> He naruto runs
[1:34:07] <Nekros4442> @Tearonex surprise, alot of games end on top of the same tower ;p
[1:34:08] <Ion_Laser> that run LUL
[1:34:08] <+Pieguy813> Can't wait for the boss fight to get worse when it gets easer
[1:34:09] <BunnyEmperor> Music not really fitting here
[1:34:09] <%Vinebi21> I gave up at this boss fight
[1:34:09] <theangryguyofde> I did this on hard. I just abused the counter punch
[1:34:11] <Luesagna00> cant u DODGE in anyway?
[1:34:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> STOP RUNNiNG JiNGU, you're just gonna get more wrath!
[1:34:13] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, look at that Naruto run
[1:34:13] <%CJett92> Did that motherfucker just Naruto-run away?
[1:34:13] <%JayEarly> At least the music is good
[1:34:13] <+mik255> is jingu naruto running?
[1:34:15] <ignisacer> did he just naruto run?
[1:34:15] <starotter70> I mean the track is pretty good at least
[1:34:15] <+ChestMimik> Jingu really just Naruto runs
[1:34:15] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Whoa Jingu uses the running animation from Lao Gui when he's got the gun in his hands
[1:34:17] <cerberuscarmine> naruto run away jingu!
[1:34:19] <TReaperx1> every yakuza game ends on roofs
[1:34:31] <flame_of_udun_> Jingu is a fucking narutard oh lord
[1:34:31] <+robcanvas> Wow, this Fighting Force playthrough looks great!
[1:34:32] <ancrest_tant> I forgot about his Naurto run
[1:34:34] <BaronVonDickButt> So glad the only time i caught this Kawami stream is uring the WORST part of the entire series.
[1:34:35] <CrypticMochi> At least in 4 you can get that armor to block it
[1:34:39] <LegendaryDorkKnight> gangsters always win against trained spec ops members
[1:34:40] <%HiroTSK5> So it's every boss in a Yakuza game
[1:34:40] <+Deano8817> oh god, was it really like this in the original? I don't even remember

[1:34:50] <%dukenux> Oh so it wasn't as bad in the original?

[1:35:23] <%Divryne> YOU DIDN'T WIN.
[1:35:23] <krymzen5> that was rad

[1:35:29] <BaronVonDickButt> atleast they dont have guns... I guess
[1:35:29] <Ner234> That was cool tho
[1:35:29] <zerocruz> BIG FUN
[1:35:29] <%Binary_Fireball> Binary_Fireball subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:35:30] <Monkeyweed21> this would be awesome if it wasn't terrible
[1:35:30] <%Gatzarlok> Do you think Kiryu goes in to the doctor for an annual check up and baffles doctors with his 300000 bullet wounds?
[1:35:31] <%gespenst25> Jet stream attack!
[1:35:31] <LegendaryDorkKnight> did he just uzamaki barrage!?
[1:35:32] <mayorrev> THIS IS NOT WHAT COPS DO
[1:35:33] <Scyllas> Ultra Instinct Colonels
[1:35:33] <+SPplayer> I sure hope you have tigerdrop
[1:35:33] <ScreamingMeat> At least they don't have fucking guns anymore
[1:35:34] <%Niney_Who> Asura's Wrath has better combat than this
[1:35:34] <%Divryne> SKULLS PARASITE UNIT.
[1:35:35] <a_mad_dragon> there's two colonels again?
[1:35:36] <%galaxyswirl> you almost got heat moved
[1:35:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Unlimited_Coffee_Works) (warning)
[1:35:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Are these guys Dante and Vergil?
[1:35:38] <%Niney_Who> Yeah it SUCKS
[1:35:38] <%vectorless_peon> this looks less fun than Wii Shovelware
[1:35:38] <+Grayhammatter> this is quite literally the worst
[1:35:38] <+Evitron1> kiwami is yakuza 0 but with all of the flavor taken out
[1:35:41] <GMN1> git gud nerd
[1:35:42] <%shiplord13> An endless nightmare
[1:35:43] <+McSoliace> ok that one is real bad
[1:35:44] <%AlvinTheLiar> A blazing aura fueled by the thoughts of a pay check
[1:35:44] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Lol they’re on fire
[1:35:44] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Is there a way to cheese this?
[1:35:46] <Ion_Laser> fUCK YOU GAME AND THE DISC YOU CAME IN ON
[1:35:46] <+ChestMimik> This is the worst fight in Naruto by far
[1:35:47] <starotter70> What do you mean?
[1:35:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Do you have knife counters?
[1:35:49] <%AncelDeLambert> I guess you're just supposed to beast style on them until they go down
[1:35:51] <%0dokuro> Try gun?
[1:35:52] <+tigerfang86> THE VULTURES WAIT
[1:35:54] <Basch71> now they dodge Jebaited
[1:35:54] <%terminallyCapriciousz> Isn't there a bomb timer ticking down during all of this?
[1:35:55] <+tigerfang86> TO SEE WHAT ROTS
[1:35:55] <tj_timbs> it's funny cus this boss fight is nothing with tiger drop, which is to say how busted tiger drop is
[1:35:55] <starotter70> It looks fine
[1:35:58] <%lemon_lore> anyway to cheat?
[1:35:59] <CastellanVon> Tiger Drop is the only way to cheese this
[1:36:00] <BunnyEmperor> Alright I guess I wont get Kiwami for Steam then LUL
[1:36:02] <+ThatHomestar> lol in the original, once you kill those guys they don't come back
[1:36:02] <%AncelDeLambert> cheat, look up cheats
[1:36:04] <%galaxyswirl> @Gogogolem there is but you have to have dragon style
[1:36:05] <%Ilpala271> omg did he die what happened?!
[1:36:06] <+gruff_gridof> synchronized dodging
[1:36:06] <+metalsiren31> This fight is utter garbage
[1:36:06] <flame_of_udun_> THIS IS FINE
[1:36:06] <%MagickBurritoh> COMBO
[1:36:07] <+popcorn143> i can FEEL the frustration emanating out of pat through the screen and i love it
[1:36:07] <nerdblase> It's like the game realizes the strategy of eliminating the smaller threats first and is now forcing you to juggle.
[1:36:09] <%spiritofmojave> UAAAAAH
[1:36:11] <%AncelDeLambert> none of us blame you, go get some cheats
[1:36:12] <Dr_Mooose> combo'd
[1:36:13] <ScreamingMeat> Use more supers
[1:36:13] <$RaikenTB> Maybe this fight needs an easy mode LUL
[1:36:15] <SirDogBear> its fights like this that didnt make me feel bad spamming tiger palm
[1:36:16] <TReaperx1> there are strats but enjoy the fight XD
[1:36:16] <VritraReiRei> anyone who's played this, how is this fight with Dragon of Dojima instead?
[1:36:17] <%Edgy_Macaroon> that's fair
[1:36:19] <Sitromxe> Git good tho.
[1:36:19] <LegendaryDorkKnight> theres gotta be a trick to it
[1:36:21] <%AncelDeLambert> go find an infinite Heat cheat, fuck this
[1:36:21] <+Dull_Fangs> have fun having no health for the final boss
[1:36:21] <circular7> knife > gun
[1:36:21] <切捨御免> no, badly made is fine
[1:36:23] <%Mekhet09> The only super that matters is tiger drop.
[1:36:24] <%0dokuro> That really should do more damage
[1:36:25] <%Dr_DangerPhD> I remember I cheesed the hell out of the original by coming in with super good weapons I bought
[1:36:29] <krymzen5> kiwamis fine for the most part. the bosses suck tho
[1:36:30] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Never make a faithful remake kids
[1:36:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Don't you have that one wakeup headbutt move for beast?
[1:36:33] <flame_of_udun_> All of those staminan royales are completely necessary
[1:36:34] <%troxcree> Heat move degredation was a mistake
[1:36:37] <majima666> are you supposed to just go after jingu?
[1:36:40] <%dukenux> This is why you should get it on PC. cause you can cheat the fuck out of this crap
[1:36:41] <+Deano8817> @VritraReiRei still terrible, their movesets make it hard to even tiger drop cheese them
[1:36:44] <mayorrev> This would be dramatically easier if you could throw them off the ledgetbh
[1:36:48] <zerocruz> Tiger drop is the only way out of this shitty boss fight
[1:36:48] <%0dokuro> This is garbo
[1:36:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GRENADE
[1:36:51] <TReaperx1> you need weapons to beat them fast
[1:36:52] <Ultimatefool> Is it me or does this look worse than 0 graphically?
[1:36:54] <theangryguyofde> @vritrareirei abuse the counter punch to kill the adds
[1:36:55] <Dr_Mooose> this is why Kiryu needs a gun
[1:36:55] <InugamiTheHound> why not beat up the main boss instead?
[1:36:56] <+SPplayer> @VritraReiRei you get tigerdrop, which trivializes bosses
[1:37:00] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> this looks absolutely miserable
[1:37:00] <%Mekhet09> You were supposed to max dragon TbH.
[1:37:02] <%vectorless_peon> why is theree no disarm move?
[1:37:02] <%amilie3> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:37:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> That did 0 damage
[1:37:07] <%Gatzarlok> Somehow they are faster after getting the shit kicked out of them.
[1:37:08] <ovan20> god, this makes the game looks terrible.
[1:37:09] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, look how little damage that did
[1:37:09] <alexandrecau> use consumables and weapon
[1:37:11] <flame_of_udun_> @ultimatefool its a low budget title
[1:37:21] <Hazard_Kujacker> @VritraReiRei About the same unless you have Tiger Drop, in which case every fight in the game get's trivialized including Amon
[1:37:24] <%Binary_Fireball> Just deflect
[1:37:27] <+MrRabbles> heat move degradation doesn't matter that much with weapons because they seem to have a minimum damage cap
[1:37:30] <+Deano8817> this almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter
[1:37:30] <AzirothTheGreat> lame em out
[1:37:31] <%joylent_blue> i do not remember this fight giving me this much trouble
[1:37:31] <ShreddingPixels> This really makes me appreciate Kiwami 2
[1:37:32] <%dukenux> @Ultimatefool probably cause stage and models weren't as detailed in the original
[1:37:34] <%Zamorouskiwhich> One of these days we shall be released from this helI sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:37:35] <%AncelDeLambert> god, at least Ornstein and Smaugh didn't have knockdown mechanics
[1:37:36] <%afronooch> @vectorless_peon there is, pat used it whe nthey had gubs
[1:37:36] <circular7> dragon or rush should make this easier
[1:37:37] <majima666> what if they just re-spawn infinitley though lol
[1:37:41] <%amilie3> LUL
[1:37:42] <%afronooch> they just dont lose guns
[1:37:45] <+popcorn143> knife boys with the JUKES
[1:37:45] <%Mekhet09> His dragon is garbage.
[1:37:46] <%JayEarly> look at these assholes Bloodborne dashing all over the place
[1:37:47] <flame_of_udun_> Man Kiwami 2 is so much better its laughable
[1:37:47] <reiju_22> LUL LUL LUL
[1:37:48] <phatballlz54> even if you take out jingu first you still have to fight his guards
[1:37:48] <LegendaryDorkKnight> cant block a KNIFE
[1:37:50] <TReaperx1> Pat
[1:37:50] <BunnyEmperor> INB4 Pat loses and has to redo all of this LUL
[1:37:51] <krymzen5> the series really has improved
[1:37:54] <%0dokuro> Sekiro: Yakuza's die Twice
[1:37:55] <tj_timbs> i find that if you jab once in Rush style, it usually provokes them into doing something which you can play around
[1:37:55] <%Niney_Who> This is like getting bullied as a 6th grader
[1:37:57] <%Niney_Who> By adults
[1:37:58] <+Toppunchpoopbob> at least the music is good
[1:38:02] <TReaperx1> pat BECOMES @AngriestPat
[1:38:03] <+SPplayer> @AngriestPat after playing this, would you agree that this game is obsessed with "fight 12 guys in a small box"?
[1:38:04] <worldbrand> YEAH!
[1:38:06] <%Divryne> CHEESE.
[1:38:08] <+Deano8817> BECOME BEAST

[1:39:10] <TReaperx1> LUL
[1:39:13] <%JayEarly> KUSOOOO
[1:39:14] <Basch71> Yakuza 1 Bullet Proof Vest was basically required for this fight
[1:39:14] <%0dokuro> one down
[1:39:16] <circular7> you don't FailFish
[1:39:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Look at these motherfuckers wave dash with their filthy melee stink lines
[1:39:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You are so going to get it, Jingu
[1:39:17] <%Deft_Thought> @AngriestPat Doesn't Dragon stance have an all purpose counter?
[1:39:18] <%Bupkis7> enbSwoleL apatCrazyhead enbSwoleR
[1:39:18] <Luesagna00> ........like u took those previous phases for no RAISIN
[1:39:19] <+McSoliace> Tiger drop this game
[1:39:19] <%mercado94> thats a big explosive bullet if you think about it
[1:39:19] <SirDogBear> bullet amulet. not explosion amulet, silly pat :)
[1:39:20] <%joylent_blue> do you have something that protects against knives?
[1:39:21] <phatballlz54> this fight is badass right guys?!

[1:39:23] <kingra> Damn

[1:39:25] <%AlvinTheLiar> Equip the knife proof one
[1:39:26] <+Toppunchpoopbob> They come back again Kappa

[1:39:27] <%KilroyGrin532> 3
[1:39:29] <%Toynota10> Kiryu should be dead
[1:39:29] <InfiniteSwagbito> Kiwami here was my first Yakuza game, I don't recall having this much trouble here
[1:39:29] <+metalsiren31> Tiger Drop is complete garbage completely because it reduces all combat to just do this one move over and over
[1:39:31] <Zuzu_Pachulia> prevents that stupid long stagger animation tho\
[1:39:32] <%dukenux> USELESS
[1:39:33] <LegendaryDorkKnight> he just got shot in the back of the head
[1:39:33] <%AncelDeLambert> preventing knockdown is the only thing you WANT it to do!!
[1:39:37] <flame_of_udun_> At least the Nishiki fight is better
[1:39:37] <%Binary_Fireball> mudamudamudamuda
[1:39:39] <Chester_goes_Berserk> it stops the long knockdown tho

[1:40:06] <Nekros4442> That dude is playing dark souls right now

[1:40:08] <%Niney_Who> Did you see it HOME IN ON YOU
[1:40:08] <BunnyEmperor> the satsui no hado is strong in this one
[1:40:09] <+ChestMimik> Trickswordtrickswordguntrick
[1:40:10] <critikal_bit> This guy is a dark souls character with all those dodges
[1:40:10] <+McSoliace> 3rd phase incoming
[1:40:10] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Now use your secret weapon.. EXPLODIING TOWER MATCH
[1:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> final battles should be tough, not ANNOYING
[1:40:12] <dekkitout> That guy must be a beast in Sekiro
[1:40:13] <%spiritofmojave> The trajectory of that LUL
[1:40:13] <%0dokuro> Colonels are this powerful in real life, can confirm
[1:40:14] <starotter70> SwordTrickGuardTrickSwordGunTrick
[1:40:15] <Desertfishing> this guy would be awesome on a dodgeball team
[1:40:17] <%Mekhet09> At least the music is good.
[1:40:18] <%joylent_blue> fuck you jingu
[1:40:20] <%dukenux> KUSO
[1:40:22] <eldragon_1> this is painful to watch
[1:40:23] <+tigerfang86> SWORDGUNTRICK
[1:40:23] <Dr_Mooose> music still epic though
[1:40:24] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, just have that chick blow up the tower

[1:40:28] <OhioNitsud> LUL
[1:40:28] <%mercado94> is this the final boss?
[1:40:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> See Pat, I told you Rush works
[1:40:30] <flame_of_udun_> This music is too good for this shit
[1:40:30] <Sitromxe> Knifeman is the true final boss.
[1:40:31] <%wvuboii> love how that rocket just appears to hit you
[1:40:32] <%JayEarly> @Nekros4442 nah this fucker is playing Bloodborne
[1:40:33] <%bread_assassin> At least the Nishiki fight is cool.
[1:40:33] <%Niney_Who> Now KILL COWARD
[1:40:33] <ScreamingMeat> And for some reason the shrapnel totally ignores they solider dude
[1:40:33] <%Toynota10> This MIA guy must be a beast at Tekken
[1:40:34] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> They're using the most powerful heat moves of all, Gun
[1:40:35] <%joylent_blue> mercado94 no LUL
[1:40:35] <+MrRabbles> the game forces you to use rush style on most occasions and its kinda annoying
[1:40:36] <BunnyEmperor> Cant touch me
[1:40:40] <%nobunagaesq> nobunagaesq subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat, no crazy introduction tonight. I'm currently finishing up my law school applications. Thanks for helping me stay up late and power through undergrad studies a year ahead of schedule. Looking forward to many more months and late nights!

[1:41:31] <kingra> FUCK YO HEAL
[1:41:31] <cerberuscarmine> EXTREME
[1:41:33] <%Gatzarlok> Naruto running with his gun in gangsta pose, that's something.
[1:41:33] <prime_name> His fucking run
[1:41:34] <%0dokuro> Means Extreme
[1:41:34] <starotter70> This is how Pat gets hyped
[1:41:34] <%Laecerelius> How the FUCK does this old man have heat?

[1:41:38] <ScreamingMeat> WHy run away like that if you're not gonna shoot the fucking gun!?
[1:41:38] <%BonewheelVanguard> If I saw a man take, like, 35 gunshots to the gut and still on hand toss a full grown man over his shoulder I would just submit myself to death.
[1:41:40] <MaxonMashville> kiwami means extreme

[1:41:54] <flame_of_udun_> Kiwami means KUSOOOO
[1:41:55] <%0dokuro> I honestly dont know
[1:41:55] <ShreddingPixels> It's kinda simple.
[1:41:57] <+Deano8817> 30 fps for console, pc saves the day again
[1:41:57] <+Dull_Fangs> combat does not feel nearly as good
[1:41:57] <%Niney_Who> Ragdolls are OP and People miss style switching
[1:41:57] <majima666> like i said fighting in the shops and smashing the place up is so satisfyinh
[1:41:59] <starotter70> I think its fine
[1:42:01] <+Toppunchpoopbob> That just makes it better lol
[1:42:01] <%afronooch> ragdoll is kinda busted
[1:42:01] <TReaperx1> its awesome ragdols
[1:42:02] <%spiritofmojave> People probably just miss the style-switching
[1:42:02] <Ultimatefool> 6 HAS bad frame issues
[1:42:04] <tj_timbs> @AngriestPat i just miss the styles really
[1:42:05] <Scorian> not as fleshed out
[1:42:06] <+McSoliace> it's fun but goofy
[1:42:06] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Combat moves are a lot more limited
[1:42:07] <Basch71> people are used to 0's style system
[1:42:07] <+PRAECESSOR> feels kinda lame only having the one style
[1:42:08] <+mik255> 6 is clearly a new game and isnt as satisfying as 5 or 0
[1:42:09] <+miguelrod777> this music is cool tho
[1:42:10] <+textandnumbers> 6 was very easy to cheese
[1:42:10] <OhioNitsud> ragdoll is hilarious though
[1:42:11] <flame_of_udun_> Not as many heat moves
[1:42:11] <%Divryne> LUL
[1:42:12] <+jkobe34> 6 is the first in the new engine so it has problems and less content
[1:42:12] <Hazard_Kujacker> @AngriestPat People got too attached to the Style System
[1:42:13] <majima666> ragdoll makes it more fun imo
[1:42:13] <roflwaffleauthoritah> the ragdolls are hilarious
[1:42:13] <%Niney_Who> that sucked
[1:42:13] <%clausover> @AngriestPat i think its because only one style instead of 4
[1:42:14] <%Divryne> GURGLE.
[1:42:15] <+Promessa_EX> Nintendo still rip
[1:42:16] <%troxcree> Less moves kinda sucks.
[1:42:18] <%MonsieurHedge> what a NOTHING finish
[1:42:18] <%amilie3> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:42:19] <+ChestMimik> Nintendo still made out of fire
[1:42:20] <InugamiTheHound> you did it!
[1:42:20] <HollowMan190> they changed to combat
[1:42:21] <%dukenux> LUL
[1:42:21] <krymzen5> it's not as fleshed out as zero
[1:42:21] <+ThatHomestar> 6's combat is boring
[1:42:21] <+Ell1ot> MercyWing1 sipsipHellmo MercyWing2
[1:42:22] <%AncelDeLambert> Lord.... Sadler.
[1:42:24] <%spiritofmojave> m o r t i s
[1:42:24] <%connos_livereview> Dragon engine is great folk are just pissy cos stricter moveset
[1:42:25] <circular7> yes
[1:42:25] <+textandnumbers> just turn kiryu into a human missile every fight
[1:42:26] <Desertfishing> eeeh bleh
[1:42:26] <BunnyEmperor> Very dramatic
[1:42:27] <%MagickBurritoh> ANTICLIMAX
[1:42:27] <CrypticMochi> Not refined enough yet I guess
[1:42:29] <LegendaryDorkKnight> dramatic finish!
[1:42:30] <flame_of_udun_> FUCK OFF JINGU
[1:42:31] <+tigerfang86> NOT DEAD THO
[1:42:31] <thebehatted> he's evil because he made you fight this boss fight
[1:42:31] <%Laecerelius> Pile drive him off the top of the building!
[1:42:31] <%joylent_blue> no style switching DansGame
[1:42:32] <Josef_Stryker> RIP
[1:42:34] <+Toppunchpoopbob> I prefer 1 style
[1:42:36] <leole11> can't believe you drank so many stamina x! only a hero could do that!
[1:42:37] <majima666> the battles in these games have always been over the top so the ragdoll stuff doesnt bother me in the slightest
[1:42:37] <%Niney_Who> Yeah but 6 is only Kiryu
[1:42:38] <lionmanguy> gy
[1:42:38] <$milhousego> @AngriestPat what are you playing after Yakuza?
[1:42:39] <entwizzler96> which one is pat playing next?
[1:42:40] <SirDogBear> after all that and kiryu doesnt even bother to double tap to make sure hes down
[1:42:40] <+frontlinecaster> Well! Glad that's all over
[1:42:42] <phatballlz54> but the combat is still fun as hell
[1:42:42] <flame_of_udun_> Worst villain in the series
[1:42:43] <%troxcree> They removed a bunch of heat moves also.
[1:42:44] <+Deano8817> kiryu is down to 1 fighting style in dragon engine, so yeah
[1:42:44] <lionmanguy> test
[1:42:46] <Chester_goes_Berserk> It'll improve tho, the cities are way better
[1:42:47] <tj_timbs> pat is playing 6 next
[1:42:47] <%JayEarly> @afronooch is it busted in your favor though? Because that'd be better than this nonsense
[1:42:48] <%spiritofmojave> I think that 6 does 1 style well anyways so I don't mind
[1:42:48] <+thehoboacrossts> Nishki pog
[1:42:48] <thebehatted> about goddamn time Nishiki
[1:42:48] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, how does this bitch die and leave Haruka with Kiryu?
[1:42:49] <%dukenux> yeah... i won. wait, shit, the BOMB is still here
[1:42:49] <$COLEZILLA> cheer100 Hey pat, here's some bits to congratulate you for beating possibly one of the worst boss fights in gaming
[1:42:50] <InugamiTheHound> what about the bomb?
[1:42:50] <dekkitout> The whole gang's here
[1:42:51] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Depends on how you like your games; 6 feels a lot like Kiwami in that enemies are constantly blocking your attacks, you have way less options compared to 0/Kiwami, it's impossible to hold onto weapons, etc.
[1:42:51] <prime_name> Oh yeah.
[1:42:51] <+frontlinecaster> Oh hey Nishiki you bitch
[1:42:52] <+mik255> also 6's vilain is lame
[1:42:52] <circular7> LUL
[1:42:53] <%0dokuro> Swagger
[1:42:53] <krymzen5> i miss styles, but still loved 6
[1:42:53] <%maskedriderhero> Here we go!
[1:42:55] <tj_timbs> Nishiki: "I'm here too"
[1:42:55] <roflwaffleauthoritah> 6 gets repetitive as FUCK because the movelist/heat moves are so barebones
[1:43:02] <ShreddingPixels> Finally, a good fight.
[1:43:04] <+frontlinecaster> Yes
[1:43:05] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> I think Kiwami 2 fixed a bunch of issues but I'm waiting to play it on the PC version
[1:43:06] <+Dull_Fangs> I gonna be real chef I like Nishi more then 2's villain
[1:43:08] <+tigerfang86> KINDA
[1:43:09] <omen_setter> haven't played 6 but it's pretty good in Kiwami 2
[1:43:10] <AzirothTheGreat> yes
[1:43:12] <%Ilpala271> YES
[1:43:12] <zerocruz> BRING THAT SHIT
[1:43:12] <%snow_bush> Yes
[1:43:13] <flame_of_udun_> FOR WHOSE SAKE Kreygasm
[1:43:15] <+frontlinecaster> We all hate you Nishiki
[1:43:17] <%joylent_blue> turn the sprinklers on SO ITS RAINING
[1:43:21] <+mik255> TIME FOR VERGIL
[1:43:24] <+frontlinecaster> Ummm about that buddy
[1:43:24] <alexandrecau> I protected you from a rapist
[1:43:25] <%rdark_ksu> Doubt
[1:43:27] <%weissguard> About that.... LUL
[1:43:28] <Josef_Stryker> I NEED MORE POWER
[1:43:29] <BunnyEmperor> Is this the real final boss?
[1:43:31] <+tigerfang86> MORE POWER
[1:43:32] <%Das_Bass> jackpot
[1:43:34] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Blow up the tower
[1:43:35] <hussdogrob> my patch for joker seems to be downloading I'm at 25%
[1:43:36] <%JayEarly> You were such a bro once
[1:43:36] <majima666> im bummed they didnt include kiryu in his jacket and jeans that they had for the demo of 6. i think he looked badass like that
[1:43:37] <dekkitout> I'll become Yakuzokage
[1:43:37] <+ChestMimik> Nishiki WILL be the Next Hokage
[1:43:38] <%JayEarly> whyyyyy
[1:43:42] <+frontlinecaster> Listen Nishiki this is awkward but I'm your boss now
[1:43:44] <majima666> well, the japanese original tech demo
[1:43:49] <flame_of_udun_> Goraa
[1:43:55] <leole11> but he didn't knew that i knew that he knew that i knew that he knew!
[1:43:55] <ValidVenasaur> what a twist
[1:43:55] <circular7> saying this is Virgil is an insult to Virgil
[1:43:58] <%puhff> !uptime
[1:43:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 44m.
[1:43:58] <%SaltyDongs> not even myself
[1:43:59] <%Rust_Wick> vergil and nishki are not even remotely alike
[1:44:00] <%MagickBurritoh> SODA
[1:44:00] <%TheBigO75> So depressed Vergil
[1:44:00] <%Gatzarlok> Poor niski, always the supporting character, never the protagonist.
[1:44:00] <+mik255> donmt trust anyone not even yourself
[1:44:03] <%dukenux> Keanu Reeves as Nishiki
[1:44:08] <@commanderclaw> Now *this* is a good fight
[1:44:10] <MelancholicMasochist> I cant trust anyone because I am the betrayer
[1:44:12] <%JayEarly> "I can't trust anyone because I betrayed you!" are you for real
[1:44:12] <tj_timbs> @Dull_Fangs i'd disagree with you if this game and 0 didn't give him the backstory it did
[1:44:16] <%joylent_blue> nishiki is barely a rival character, you never fight him except here
[1:44:18] <circular7> more like weak Virgil
[1:44:19] <%spiritofmojave> Nishki can't even qualify as shitty Vergil if you ask me
[1:44:20] <Triox45> what the fuck is this dialogue where they just repeated what he just fuckiing said
[1:44:21] <+Deano8817> paul rudd vs keannu reaves in American Yakuza

[1:49:53] <%0dokuro> We can only go up from here
[1:49:55] <%Gatzarlok> So.. Nishiki was like watching over Kiryu through out 0, and he still wants to fight him now?
[1:49:55] <omen_setter> get a tattoo of elmo on your back
[1:49:56] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Could be worse, could be Indigo Prophecy's final fight
[1:49:59] <%spiritofmojave> tfw download server is still down
[1:50:01] <%TDotGoat> Elmo want the controller
[1:50:02] <%PlainSimpleTailor> This is the opposite of the final fight in Kill Bill
[1:50:04] <CygnusRoboticus> what kind of Yakuza back tattoo would Elmo have?
[1:50:04] <tj_timbs> but that added intro to this fight where they clash is awesome
[1:50:09] <+SoarFlyer> yakuzer used full heal!
[1:50:10] <ScreamingMeat> So what's Nishiki's style? Fish?
[1:50:10] <%vectorless_peon> if this doesnt devolve into a slapfight im going to bed
[1:50:11] <%Binary_Fireball> i wish nishki was actually majima
[1:50:11] <+frontlinecaster> Let! Elmo! PLay!
[1:50:16] <CygnusRoboticus> I think it'd be a giant stylish Paige
[1:50:20] <+Tokanova> idk if you can win this fight without the heat move for dragon

[1:50:29] <%joylent_blue> oh man i LOVE watching Yakuza recaps, they're the best
[1:50:31] <%Gatzarlok> @CygnusRoboticus Omi-paige
[1:50:33] <circular7> it won't
[1:50:34] <alexandrecau> oh man you fucked up there
[1:50:35] <%mastertwin2> Elmo would get a full body tattoo if his bag
[1:50:40] <tj_timbs> @AngriestPat how soon until you play Yakuza 6 on stream do ya think?
[1:50:41] <Solidus_113> Yakuza 6 has a VERY long intro where they explain the backstories for every single character that matters
[1:50:44] <theangryguyofde> the energy drinker of Dojima
[1:50:45] <Josef_Stryker> I wish Nishiki would switch styles as the fight went on.
[1:50:48] <@JustinianKnight> this fight looks miserable
[1:50:49] <cerberuscarmine> inb4 majima shows up and stabs em both
[1:50:50] <hussdogrob> @spiritofmojave keep trying I just got through
[1:50:57] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat isn't this just dante and vergil all over again
[1:50:59] <+Deano8817> It did it's job when I used them
[1:51:00] <SomersaultJustice> are they also in a tiny resolution in yakuza 6?
[1:51:01] <CygnusRoboticus> @gatzarlok blessed Omi-Paige
[1:51:01] <SirDogBear> the weird thing this game did too was even though they did more for nishiki's story i felt more attached to majima at end of game after fighting him 200 times
[1:51:03] <%CrowFreemo> CrowFreemo subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:51:05] <InugamiTheHound> Nishkiyama has some cool dance moves while fighting you LOL
[1:51:06] <+Evitron1> stop dancing nishiki
[1:51:07] <@JustinianKnight> yo
[1:51:07] <omen_setter> do NIshiki and Kiryu go to the same tailor
[1:51:07] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Wow this game's combat seems tedious as hell
[1:51:10] <+Deano8817> I only needed to recap 2 though, not an entire series worth of games
[1:51:10] <Sitromxe> "Hold on, while I guzzle this energy drink."
[1:51:11] <%Binary_Fireball> is it hard miserable or just long as fuck miserable?
[1:51:14] <VritraReiRei> With or Without Dragon Style?
[1:51:15] <+mik255> jingu was the worst part
[1:51:15] <%El_Desperad0> it's fun with Dragon style
[1:51:17] <Josef_Stryker> This fight is way better with Dragon Style perfected
[1:51:17] <%spiritofmojave> @hussdogrob oh nice, grats! guess I will in that case, ty
[1:51:17] <@JustinianKnight> gotcha
[1:51:17] <+RushUnplugged> but the question is, where did Nishiki learn the legendary Magikarp stype
[1:51:18] <circular7> this fight could be badass but you needs dragon mode
[1:51:20] <cerberuscarmine> oh snap
[1:51:20] <%Themightymightyena> Yakuza 4 is the best only because of all the horrible shit Akiyama says to Hana
[1:51:22] <tj_timbs> The Yakuza 6 intro is very bizarre. They explain characters that barely show up throughout the game
[1:51:23] <%Shadowthedigger> So tomorrow?
[1:51:25] <%snow_bush> Yaaaaaaaaay
[1:51:25] <DocChutney> this is like the anti vergil fight
[1:51:25] <starotter70> But it's feel goddamn refreshing after Jingu
[1:51:27] <+Toppunchpoopbob> PogChamp
[1:51:30] <Triox45> is it that there's too much, or that there's not enough that was cut?
[1:51:30] <%Laecerelius> Wanna use your heat to do cool moves? NOPE! Gotta keep it in case the boss decides to heal an entire life bar!
[1:51:31] <blackbaron98> finally
[1:51:34] <VritraReiRei> So... in 2 hours?
[1:51:37] <ScreamingMeat> You mean tomorrow?
[1:51:39] <%Binary_Fireball> mmmkaayyyy gonna need that dps report
[1:51:41] <flame_of_udun_> LUL
[1:51:42] <%lemon_lore> over time slave not
[1:51:46] <%0dokuro> Gotta get that grind
[1:51:53] <+Deano8817> it's just all apart of the dumb boss regen thing, this fight is great besides it
[1:51:53] <%El_Desperad0> just Majima's
[1:51:54] <+Tokanova> but pat the games fun
[1:51:55] <+tigerfang86> pat HATES pocket racing, what a villain
[1:51:56] <Dr_Mooose> that's because your weak
[1:51:56] <rickaay15> @Tokanova You can bt itakes....awhile. majima glitched on my first playthrough so i couldn't unlock the kiwami dragon move, it took...20 minutes or so which was nnot fun
[1:51:56] <%troxcree> If you do that it's over in like 6 Tiger Drops.
[1:51:57] <+Tokanova> don't you like fun?
[1:51:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I agree with Pat, that sounds like garbage given the METRIC FUCKLOAD of side content
[1:51:59] <GustauveVIII> fighting this fight with dragon style still sucks cuz hes too fast for it
[1:52:00] <ShichiNoBushi> But how else would they get you to play Pocket Racer and Mesu King?
[1:52:01] <%castcode> monkaS
[1:52:01] <%TheBigO75> Grinding sucks
[1:52:04] <theangryguyofde> wait so pat didn't do some offscreen grinding WutFace
[1:52:06] <+Promessa_EX> is it 8:50 yet?
[1:52:11] <+MrRabbles> the way they treat the legend styles in 0 and kiwami sucks
[1:52:12] <+Tokanova> oh god thats awful rickaay15
[1:52:12] <%kewlmyc> So unlocking Dragon style is worse than in Zero?
[1:52:16] <%0dokuro> Hear those bones break
[1:52:17] <tj_timbs> it is
[1:52:18] <rickaay15> yep
[1:52:19] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Kiwami is a bit too kiwami tbh
[1:52:21] <eldragon_1> "Yeah... I'm gonna need that in 2 hours." *sips coffee
[1:52:23] <tj_timbs> uh
[1:52:24] <flame_of_udun_> @kewlmyc by far

[2:04:21] <+RushUnplugged> Yumi had sex so she passed on her bulletproof powers to Haruka
[2:04:24] <%shiplord13> She was untouched by the explosion

[2:05:27] <CastellanVon> Kiryu has every reason to completely lose it in this game.
[2:05:28] <%vectorless_peon> Kiryu should have severe emotional trauma
[2:05:28] <+Deano8817> Kiryu's life is fucking baka mitai

[2:05:43] <lpkilledthetelltalestar> Kiryu is totally okay
[2:05:44] <odiemikes> directed by David Cage
[2:05:44] <SirDogBear> haruka will become a superstar and pay him back in full though
[2:05:45] <+thehoboacrossts> Which is more depressing, this or Majima's whole deal with Makoto
[2:05:45] <derekwst3> sounds like real life
[2:05:45] <+Dull_Fangs> God people always talkn about how optomistic this series is
[2:05:45] <suikudo> The more i think about it the more i think i hate the story of these games
[2:05:45] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu exists to suffer
[2:05:45] <Basch71> his dad also died too
[2:05:46] <%castcode> It really just stacks up when you list it off like that
[2:05:46] <PkSilent01> @konekoryugamine You took the words out of my mouth. Feelsbad
[2:05:46] <%Laecerelius> Kiryu's life is super fucked
[2:05:46] <+AxeassinChris> Kiryu... Had a hard life.
[2:05:48] <%Binary_Fireball> Yea but kiryu is dumb as fuck. So as much as he's a "good" guy he is not smart or practical
[2:05:48] <+Evitron1> reina dies too
[2:05:48] <+tigerfang86> at least kiryu gets to be friends with majima
[2:05:49] <%flagi64> Wait wuttttt
[2:05:50] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu has 7 staminan on him
[2:05:51] <+tigerfang86> I guess
[2:05:51] <+Comrade_Vladof> The fact that Kiryu doesn't end up more fucked up is astonishing
[2:05:51] <%blaccbird914> Is kiryu just guts?
[2:05:52] <$RubberFistFight> jesus stop her fucking blabbing and get her to a fucking hospital
[2:05:52] <JamvaanPS4> Congrats on the orphan Kiryu

[2:05:58] <%snow_bush> Snake or Kiryu, who has it rougher?
[2:05:58] <krymzen5> but he's such a good person BibleThump

[2:06:00] <%Laecerelius> Yeah Nishki fucking kills Reina
[2:06:00] <%king_wragles> No matter what happens.... NEVER SHOW AN EMOTION YOU ROBOT CHILD
[2:06:01] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat He got a dog so it was all worth it
[2:06:01] <+DevinMayCry> Kiryu was spiritually Harukas dad. Not because he raised her but because Yumis soul was thinking about Kiryu when she did it
[2:06:03] <%lewdskeletor13> He wishes he could go back to being the Realty King of Kamarucho @angriestpat
[2:06:04] <eldragon_1> okaa-san BibleThump

[2:06:06] <%connos_livereview> But he still has majima
[2:06:06] <alwayspronking> Yakuza 1 is just "Kiryu has a really bad day"
[2:06:07] <%AncelDeLambert> All of his friends are dead
[2:06:07] <a_mad_dragon> and majima keeps popping up wanting to fuck him
[2:06:08] <bearwagon> at least that ugly bastard Shimano is dead
[2:06:08] <+Dull_Fangs> shinji was such a bro
[2:06:09] <SailingSaturn> "Become a idol in your future" cirDerp
[2:06:10] <%Gatzarlok> What kiryu suffers in emotional trauma from others, he gives back with his fists to random goons
[2:06:10] <+mik255> kiryu is now constantly dragged into bullshit
[2:06:12] <AzirothTheGreat> everyonedies
[2:06:12] <%mastertwin2> Yeah but at least he became a confirmed DILF
[2:06:13] <Panquake25> everything kiryu loves dies
[2:06:14] <+MrRabbles> he got to be friends with Date Kappa
[2:06:14] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Kiryu is a super tragic character. Pays his whole life for joining the yakuza

[2:06:21] <PkSilent01> BibleThump
[2:06:21] <NumberTooBig> lets chalk this up to this is a remake to an old ass game
[2:06:21] <%Das_Bass> Did he even stand a chance at a happy life?
[2:06:21] <Bonbie> Yeah honestly Yakuza 0 was nice since Kiryu was slightly less anime angst backstory

[2:06:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Look at that place. Where were they?

[2:10:43] <%king_wragles> Did we get a clean clip for that blat blat?
[2:10:45] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat Daigo's mom should have stayed chairman
[2:10:46] <+Talbz> Kiryu couldn't possibly know about the last 2 points though @AngriestPat
[2:10:47] <omen_setter> this is still not quite as weird as pretending that Sagawa was a cool dude at the end of 0
[2:10:48] <The_Butterfly_Man> cyka blyat
[2:10:48] <+tigerfang86> Majima's REALLY GOOD at it

[2:10:59] <BunnyEmperor> DOGE
[2:11:00] <%spiritofmojave> Majima handles it, arguably better than almost any other leader in the series

[2:11:07] <bearwagon> if he can run a cabaret he can run the Tojo clan

[2:16:38] <FatherGreyBeard> 8:38 for me. Said it'd be done around 8.
[2:16:40] <VritraReiRei> Wouldn't it be funny if Pat came back and realize he missed a cutscene
[2:16:42] <burgersteel> 02:38 huehue
[2:16:44] <%razorknight> man this tone shift is so weird. Why has twitch been doing this recently?
[2:16:45] <starotter70> @Kirby_Sauce Thanks
[2:16:46] <worldbrand> oh my switch is still on fire hahaha
[2:16:47] <%razorknight> it's just music
[2:16:51] <prime_name> So, anyone got Joker yet?
[2:16:58] <lovesosa236> no
[2:17:01] <%Das_Bass> no
[2:17:03] <starotter70> NaH
[2:17:04] <+ChestMimik> no
[2:17:04] <FatherGreyBeard> no
[2:17:05] <SirDogBear> nope
[2:17:06] <%rytyoung> No
[2:17:09] <%spiritofmojave> nada
[2:17:09] <+Comrade_Vladof> I'm playing him right now
[2:17:10] <%HiroTSK5> Yes
[2:17:12] <+HotBloodedHero> yes
[2:17:12] <%ShogunNoonto> yes
[2:17:14] <Viperwing999> my friend does
[2:17:14] <%averyoddjew> nope
[2:17:18] <%spiritofmojave> my uncle has him
[2:17:19] <%topendbuzz> wut
[2:17:23] <+icekept> bo server is still crashing
[2:17:24] <%Toynota10> Yo guys! Kirby can have a gun now!
[2:17:30] <majima666> my dad who works for nintendo does
[2:17:31] <%rytyoung> Damn you all lol jk have fun
[2:17:33] <%HiroTSK5> Bayo gave Kirby guns
[2:17:34] <+Dull_Fangs> my dad at nintendo does
[2:17:39] <TLPenn> I already listened to the music.
[2:17:47] <+tigerfang86> yeah but joker gave kirby THE gun
[2:17:47] <acexclover> nintendo is broken right now
[2:17:47] <%Toynota10> @HiroTSK5 Yeah true
[2:17:48] <EnlightenedKramer> oooops all joker!
[2:17:55] <+Promessa_EX> nintendo servers suck, I know persona 5 fans aren't crashing good servers
[2:17:55] <FatherGreyBeard> I wish it'd download. I need that Beneath the Mask remix in my life
[2:18:02] <+HotBloodedHero> Best I can describe is he moves fast but attacking is very deliberate
[2:18:02] <%averyoddjew> bayo's guns don't look like guns. joker's is literally a desert eagle
[2:18:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> The legend spirit battle is really easy
[2:18:04] <+Deano8817> Bowsers first move at nintendo was to give kirby a gun, praise the president.
[2:18:05] <lovesosa236> I dont get how they say releasing on 17 3 hours before the 18 and 8m in central lol
[2:18:05] <mastermidget23> Dumb question, how do I switch the chat window on mobile to the black background version? trying to not burn out my screen...
[2:18:07] <NumberTooBig> ok, if anyone is in the vicinity of anyone with the patch, just match with local users so the servers can sleep
[2:18:13] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 hey pat, got a message from my man starotter70: "My friend just suggested that Italian Slums should be called Spaghettos" thanks for the pun man.
[2:18:17] <%rytyoung> Reggie wouldnt have let this happen
[2:18:18] <+Comrade_Vladof> Kirby's got a fucking Glock
[2:18:21] <lovesosa236> im*
[2:18:24] <DraxTD> ... thanks nintnedo network for being clogged...
[2:18:33] <%mercado94> i cant to wait to play joker and get my ass kicked online
[2:18:34] <%Binary_Fireball> Because you all need your crap crack
[2:18:36] <%Kirby_Sauce> GUN KIRBY
[2:18:43] <SirDogBear> silver lining is this means joker was popular enough to crash servers, persona has come a long way
[2:18:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @DraxTD not clogged, under maintinence
[2:19:03] <DraxTD> @legendfather_of_giants ah, they say how long?
[2:19:07] <+Dull_Fangs> @SirDogBear you sure it not just Smash hype
[2:19:10] <%Das_Bass> How were they not ready for this?
[2:19:13] <ameraaaaaa> ok just made it
[2:19:15] <+icekept> "A server communication error has occurred. Please try again later."
[2:19:18] <%Kirby_Sauce> I can't even get to the eshop to get FFX
[2:19:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> @DraxTD Says estimated 11:30
[2:19:22] <%Binary_Fireball> because why would they spend money on it?
[2:19:24] <FatherGreyBeard> Are links allowed?
[2:19:27] <SirDogBear> good point @Dull_Fangs probably but at least it wasnt a dud
[2:19:28] <NumberTooBig> man, its a shame theres no SMT music thrown in there for giggles, SMT 4 has some killer songs to add
[2:19:29] <acexclover> all my fucking fighters dont even work now
[2:19:31] <%Binary_Fireball> you fucks aren't going to return shit
[2:19:31] <InugamiTheHound> don't snake,falco,fox and wolf also have guns in smash bros?
[2:19:32] <Viperwing999> what's the brb song?
[2:19:38] <lovesosa236> nah they just remembered yesterday they forgot he was even coming out
[2:19:38] <ameraaaaaa> what did i miss
[2:19:41] <Prism_Wing> If I told you 10 years ago, you'd be listening to funky tunes while waiting for Pat to leave the bathroom. what would you think?
[2:19:43] <starotter70> Might as well just wait until tomorrow
[2:19:43] <%mercado94> guess I'll play tetris
[2:19:44] <+Dull_Fangs> Bruh the SMT IV battle themes are flames
[2:19:54] <%Binary_Fireball> @Prism_Wing who the fuck is pat?
[2:19:56] <DraxTD> @legendfather_of_giants time zone? ... eh never mind I got bed in 30 for work =P
[2:20:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> EDT
[2:20:05] <%Das_Bass> I dont understand how they didnt set up for this
[2:20:10] <+Dull_Fangs> @Prism_Wing I'd ask you what the fuck is twitch and who's pat
[2:20:12] <Midnight188> cant seem to dl joker for smesh. store is down. :(
[2:20:15] <%spiritofmojave> @Prism_Wing What's a Pat
[2:20:18] <+Promessa_EX> nintendo power
[2:20:20] <FatherGreyBeard> Because the server maintanence goes on until 8 :30 PM Pacific Time.
[2:20:26] <+whiskey_wolfe_> The song is by a guy called F1ng3rz on iTunes iirc.
[2:20:27] <FatherGreyBeard> Apparently
[2:20:28] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @ameraaaaaa Kiryu is immune to building destroying explosions, apparently. Unless you were here for that
[2:20:31] <+Dull_Fangs> damn this must be Belka's fault
[2:20:34] <NumberTooBig> @Das_Bass they assumed Persona was as popular as SMT for some reason
[2:20:37] <majima666> technology is a wonderful thing
[2:20:40] <mastermidget23> Nintendo's online is usually so well made!
[2:20:44] <Prism_Wing> @dull_fangs I wouldn't mention Twitch Kappa
[2:20:46] <Huntercd> Is it just Joker in Smash or do the rest of the Phantom Thieves show up?
[2:20:52] <+HotBloodedHero> Gun has long active frames that let's you jump to rainstorm
[2:20:54] <ameraaaaaa> @prism_wing well if you told 10 year old me that I'd cry
[2:20:56] <lovesosa236> 9 in central its 942 rn probably already 12 in the east lol
[2:20:58] <NumberTooBig> @Huntercd in the stage
[2:21:00] <%Binary_Fireball> I want you all to imagine pat on his knees grunting as he tries to plugin in his switch into a giant mess of cables
[2:21:01] <%spiritofmojave> The squad shows up on the Mementos stage, which is pretty cool
[2:21:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Huntercd the others show up on his stage and as spirits
[2:21:07] <%Das_Bass> thanks nintendo, I'm unsubbing to super bunnyhop over not getting joker
[2:21:08] <+icekept> @majima666 no it ain't
[2:21:08] <+cvp5127> @Huntercd mona is a taunt
[2:21:09] <masso101> Did he finish yakuzi?
[2:21:13] <%Binary_Fireball> ya

[2:29:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and the message said, "Ehhh?"
[2:29:42] <$RubberFistFight> Nintendo can apologise as much as they fucking want, it means shit-all if they don't actually change the way their servers work thus causing this shit to happen every time there is a spike in traffic.

[2:30:34] <+NopeBadguy> OH RIGHT
[2:30:35] <+WorldsBestPanda> I sure hope Pat gets the illegal technology.
[2:30:35] <+DevinMayCry> @RubberFistFight This doesnt happen often though... Nintendo somehow has avoided these problems. Not even the smash launch had this

[2:31:00] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat hey pat you should stream the rest of yakuza 5

[2:31:09] <ItsKitKat_> GUGEON
[2:31:16] <Huntercd> Elmo
[2:31:18] <%A_Metagaming_Pigeon> Nintendo should have just said the update will release tomorrow.
[2:31:19] <Ner234> ELMO YES
[2:31:21] <%Idziman> then just upload the end to youtube you silly
[2:31:21] <foreverN2dust> gungun
[2:31:22] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat get a sweet car in Fantasy land
[2:31:23] <+phatmac16> Isn’t yakuza 6 only on ps3
[2:31:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @TalisKanju Joker once the servers are back
[2:31:30] <%Laecerelius> No Joker, Nintendo's servers are imploding
[2:31:32] <$RubberFistFight> @legendfather_of_giants yeah and my guess is the maintenance is to try and fix the fact that the servers started to fall over when people flocked to the eshop to get the Smash DLC. Nintendo are historically fucking SHITE at dealing with server load./
[2:31:32] <Huntercd> Do it Elmo
[2:31:34] <%spiritofmojave> They really should've just release this while everyone was at work/school
[2:31:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @A_Metagaming_Pigeon or, ya know, worked on the servers the night before the update dropped
[2:31:44] <+HellfireComms> wow Joker, Nintendo's servers sure are cool!

[2:32:11] <General_Terro> CANT HEAR YOU PAT
[2:32:11] <$RubberFistFight> @ThatGuyfromMars yeah that's logical thinking that requires forethought and learning from previous experiences. Something Nintendo has proven incapable of doing.
[2:32:11] <%Laecerelius> It's fine

[2:36:55] <$RubberFistFight> lol now Pat has a new fear - package deliverymen with crossbows
[2:36:58] <OkamiDude15> pat is now afraid of delivery men
[2:37:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> Just like P4
[2:37:05] <Dr_Mooose> I'd rather not get shot
[2:37:07] <nerdblase> That's some internet creepy right there.
[2:37:10] <%AbnormalVoid> what if a person delivered a box full of syringes and stabbed you with them? @AngriestPat
[2:37:13] <+DevinMayCry> What if the crossbow shoots syringes
[2:37:13] <person181> less things in me the better
[2:37:19] <starotter70> We're doing it
[2:37:21] <NeoOneShin> I love crossbows
[2:37:21] <Mr_Strut> With syringes
[2:37:21] <%Divryne> NEW FEAR ACQUIRED.
[2:37:23] <derekwst3> just don't do delivery
[2:37:24] <worldbrand> a bolt is kind of a syringe
[2:37:25] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat be careful, your next uber eats deliveryman might be hiding a TINY CROSSBOW inside the chicken poutine thing bowl.
[2:37:26] <Ion_Laser> do I have to worry about Ninjas when I get a package?
[2:37:27] <Huntercd> Holy shit did the woman survive?
[2:37:28] <%athuramn> lol he didn't take it with him btw
[2:37:30] <valentinostand> Amazon guy or Canada post delivery man you know purolator will be late
[2:37:31] <lloyddboy> Pat don't worry you're a small target
[2:37:32] <%dave323dave> one fear
[2:37:32] <Desertfishing> it was a hit job no need to worry unless you made someone mad
[2:37:33] <%crimsonharvest> pat got too much eyes on the inside
[2:37:33] <person181> i mean you haven't thought about that before now
[2:37:33] <OkamiDude15> ! new synergy unlocked !
[2:37:36] <Katalist_> Crossbow bolts can come from anywhere at anytime
[2:37:37] <%PlainSimpleTailor> DE TAILS
[2:37:38] <%mastertwin2> I'd be more impressed by the ingenuity than scared for my life
[2:37:39] <Smaenus> No fear - ONE FEAR
[2:37:39] <+Ell1ot> what if the pointy end of the bolt was a syringe?
[2:37:40] <ShichiNoBushi> How many fears is tallied on your shirt, now?
[2:37:40] <OkamiDude15> you dont
[2:37:41] <%athuramn> yeah, but she's paralyzed
[2:37:41] <Prism_Wing> It's not delivery it GIORNO
[2:37:42] <NeoOneShin> just wear a chest plate, pat
[2:37:43] <+mik255> chainmail
[2:37:44] <mor3gan> It's not delivery, it's crossbow bolt
[2:37:46] <+cvp5127> wear armor
[2:37:48] <+JackMillerTime> wear armor at all times
[2:37:51] <%radda343> train elmo to detect crossbows
[2:37:52] <mightyfat> Could’ve been a ballista
[2:37:53] <+DevinMayCry> Crossbows with syringes is how we will fix the vaccine problem
[2:37:54] <Ion_Laser> BIG Fire
[2:37:54] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Put a pillow or two in front of you when you open the door.
[2:37:55] <Desertfishing> armor doesnt work
[2:37:57] <$hatesdps> i feel like you would attack the guy trying to open the box with the crossbow in it
[2:37:57] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Pat is legitimately going to spend time tonight trying to "prepare" for surprise crossbow assassination.
[2:38:02] <%ArcanumMBD> I took a nap and woke up excited to play Joker in smash :(
[2:38:02] <worldbrand> pre-emptively shoot him with your own crossbow?
[2:38:03] <+Freakin_Osvaldo> Woo joker
[2:38:03] <%athuramn> she went to critical
[2:38:06] <starotter70> Like every other time a new character comes out
[2:38:10] <+Harthhammer> feels like raubahn savage again
[2:38:11] <OkamiDude15> cover your body in jojo manga like jotaro did against dio
[2:38:16] <NeoOneShin> Armor works pretty well, actually @Desertfishing
[2:38:18] <%MelBrooksKA> I mean, you're already afraid of being shot, so I'm not sure it's really a "new fear" @AngriestPat
[2:38:41] <starotter70> Piss Alley
[2:38:45] <+ahdurian> go to the Tokyo Robot Restaurant
[2:38:49] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Crap, that happened in Ontario. MOUNTIES ASSEMBLE

[2:40:27] <ghostravens> be like shy and use your umbral forma on a fucking sheev
[2:40:28] <+drakthebest> The first couple nightwave challenges were great. The last couple all sucked. They were all super repetitive
[2:40:29] <+ArcLifth> index is pretty much bring a max range limbo
[2:40:31] <MarylandJutsu> ENTER THE EMLOOO
[2:40:34] <+ahdurian> @MelBrooksKA that part of shinjuku is basically right in it
[2:40:35] <TotallyAHacker> excalibur umbra with a sniper is pretty good for the index
[2:40:36] <+Rada150> index is you just get a limbo and ult and time freeze the areas
[2:40:36] <worldbrand> Most are manageable, but those suck
[2:40:36] <%Laecerelius> Index is easy. Just bring a Limbo to Za Warudo your goal

[2:40:47] <worldbrand> The ayatan one got scaled back to 3
[2:40:47] <%MonsieurHedge> those eight-bounty ones SUCK for 3l standing
[2:40:49] <+AntithesisEK> khora trivializes the index one. the ayatan one is quite egregious.
[2:40:51] <%Eclipse_knight_> if you have gara you can do the index one in like 2 min @angriestpat
[2:41:05] <+drakthebest> I mean, it's fine that they can't do it, they have other stuff to do. Don't have to farm nightwave
[2:41:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> I now keep my statues unplugged until the animator event happens

[2:41:22] <+BlancoRico> I use khora for the index

[2:50:59] <%El_Desperad0> Very understandable
[2:50:59] <%nicos143> nice
[2:51:01] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat you can slice bullets with the main swing
[2:51:01] <lord_campbell96> @angriestpat the sword attack itself cuts bullets
[2:51:02] <+Grayhammatter> big busted
[2:51:08] <Smaenus> Bullet is a good boi
[2:51:11] <Lulu19> its a lttp
[2:51:13] <%El_Desperad0> He has the harddest past
[2:51:17] <VritraReiRei> Also difficult AS HELL
[2:51:17] <%El_Desperad0> *hardest
[2:51:26] <AvailDreams> The reload attack is pointless
[2:51:34] <mayorrev> yeah its pretty hard
[2:51:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> how to unlock Boolet?
[2:51:36] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat did you unlock Rainbow Mode?
[2:51:41] <%Salvation122> Doomguy
[2:51:44] <mechslayer71> Beat the Dragun for the first time yesterday, and got 3 of the bullet ingredients in the same run, FeelsGoodMan
[2:51:48] <BigCoffee> pilot is easy
[2:51:48] <mayorrev> reload is fine
[2:51:50] <+MusouMiko> I'd argue bullet's past is easy. You just have to be good at legend of zelda lol
[2:51:51] <mayorrev> it looks cool too
[2:51:51] <AvailDreams> His swing already does the job way better
[2:51:52] <%ElenaManetta> Hey! Pat got the bullet!!!
[2:52:00] <StaticSunrise> @Bane_Kaikyo pray that a rare bullet kin with a cape spawns five times without it dying
[2:52:02] <VritraReiRei> @Bane_Kaikyo after defeating a past you have to spare Red Cape Bulletkin 5 times
[2:52:02] <+whiskey_wolfe_> What a happy little bullet :)
[2:52:06] <mayorrev> it looks cool
[2:52:07] <%ElenaManetta> It does NOT move you forward
[2:52:08] <%ArcanumMBD> ITS FINE
[2:52:11] <+Grayhammatter> a guard
[2:52:13] <mayorrev> and blocks bulet
[2:52:15] <%ElenaManetta> It blocks bullets, same as firing, but it doesn't move you forward.
[2:52:19] <%El_Desperad0> @Bane_Kaikyo once you do the past of the main 4 gungeoneers, there's a enemy bullet with a red cape that doesn't attack. Let him leave a couple of times and you unlock him
[2:52:27] <+Estuko> reloads your sword
[2:52:28] <%ElenaManetta> Cooldown
[2:52:30] <mayorrev> probably a glitch
[2:52:32] <%AncelDeLambert> they finally did it, a gun that shoots swords!!!!!
[2:52:37] <madogod> gears of war reloading
[2:52:38] <StaticSunrise> it gives I frames I think? and can do a guard flash
[2:52:41] <%ElenaManetta> Cooldown for when you can block again, so you can't just block indefinitely
[2:52:42] <icantstopthescreams> Probably refreshes the block

[2:53:12] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> best weapon
[2:53:14] <+MusouMiko> unless you get a super good gun
[2:53:15] <%skizzuto> use it until you get hit, then use guns
[2:53:16] <GreyHeartedHero> If you can keep your health full

[3:00:32] <+Estuko> those blue bullets remind me of marge simpson
[3:00:36] <i_worship_his_shadow> like the reload bar?

[3:00:44] <%Sulliman34> yay cumgeon
[3:00:45] <%WackyXmand> is this the only weapon Bullet gets?
[3:00:51] <%ElenaManetta> What's the benefit of using the reload vs. just swinging all the time?
[3:00:54] <+Kilik_> just his starting weapon
[3:00:59] <+TopTieramisu> @hootdoot he doesn't want to lose the projectile for his sword
[3:01:01] <+Kilik_> the swing has a cooldown
[3:01:05] <+Estuko> @ElenaManetta all around shield for duration of reload bar
[3:01:09] <+ThePayphone> "you have been live for just over 3 hours. by this point in your broadcast you should have consumed atleast 3 cans of redbull"
[3:01:10] <+Kilik_> so you can get hit between swings
[3:01:13] <VritraReiRei> @ElenaManetta basically if you are full health double tapping gives you an extended window to destroy nearby bullets
[3:01:14] <Jathspuh> @AngriestPat When i updated my enter the gungeon, it wiped my save. Farewell To Arms? More like Goodbye My Guns.

[3:03:28] <+This_is_Marco> You do it in the map itself
[3:03:29] <StaticSunrise> dpad with the map open?
[3:03:32] <%StEmlosWater> @ElenaManetta He knows about the Oub, I just think he doesn't like it
[3:03:33] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat it's a button on your controller
[3:03:34] <benjiFG> click the left stick I think
[3:03:37] <%PaladinDupre> IN THE MAP
[3:03:41] <%PaladinDupre> ZOOM OUT
[3:03:42] <%FrustratedAF> oh cool you can just straight up be a bullet. kinda reminds me of castle crashers where you can unlock enemies
[3:03:43] <+TopTieramisu> @Nekros4442 no, but it has a gun that fires guns
[3:03:49] <+Estuko> @icantstopthescreams it's a starwars reference
[3:03:52] <krymzen5> right stick click
[3:03:53] <+This_is_Marco> yeyeye
[3:03:54] <%ElenaManetta> I didn't like it either because it was tough enemies early on, but the Bullet makes the oooOOOob so easy

[3:12:11] <$Piemono> The Bullet is great for trying to get certain win conditions, but it kinda fucks you when you go back to other characters

[3:13:04] <%Spydurman> git gud
[3:13:06] <fazoburquina> Remember that you have blanks, pat
[3:13:06] <+Austinck> can u use blanks
[3:13:14] <+linSP> BUT YOU CAN KILL BULLETS
[3:13:21] <OkamiDude15> should've blanked

[3:13:27] <%Spydurman> he'll never use those blanks
[3:13:34] <%AbnormalVoid> just be good and not bad
[3:13:37] <fearhurst> Pat you can beat the bullet king by skipping his cutscene, standing under him and swinging your sword over and over
[3:13:38] <%skizzuto> open the brown chest, you'll get a passive, and the brown chests have decent passives
[3:13:41] <+SolverCODO> PAT. They tell you this
[3:13:48] <%skizzuto> or never mind
[3:13:52] <Smaenus> The GOBLINS probably won't let him

[3:14:02] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat so you're never using your Umbral Forma in Warframe, right?

[3:14:05] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat They carry over if you hve more than 2
[3:14:05] <+HotBloodedHero> I can understand trying to go for a no hit run

[3:14:08] <mrxenobro> oooh I can see myself in chat for once. Hello pat!
[3:14:09] <+HellfireComms> it just be that way sometimes
[3:14:14] <+SolverCODO> It does make sense. They're tricky to time
[3:14:17] <that_guy_from_high_school> My rule is I save them for bosses only.
[3:14:17] <+TopTieramisu> brown chest can also give you sling
[3:14:17] <xiccy> yep
[3:14:20] <+HellfireComms> i swear there's an item that auto-uses blanks for you
[3:14:23] <that_guy_from_high_school> that way I don't forget.
[3:14:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> is the downloading working yet?
[3:14:36] <Schedrevka> Just use them when you're cornered or when a bad attack comes from the boss
[3:14:37] <prime_name> Nope
[3:14:38] <+SolverCODO> If you had time to know you'd be hit, you'd dodge out of the way in many cases
[3:14:38] <Solidus_113> have item, use item
[3:14:43] <+Austinck> He needs a full metal jacket
[3:14:51] <benjiFG> if you mess up a roll you use them
[3:14:52] <Onamar> Use it when there's too much shit on screen
[3:14:53] <%ElenaManetta> You use it when you feel overwhelmed
[3:14:55] <+SoarFlyer> just KNOW idiot
[3:14:56] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat think of them as parries
[3:14:57] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I had this eexact propblem @AngriestPat
[3:14:58] <StaticSunrise> when you aren't confident you can roll out of something
[3:15:02] <+HellfireComms> timing blanks is also just another level of meta to balance inbetween all the bullet hell stuff. It seems easy, can be tricky
[3:15:04] <televisedrevolting> Sometimes it's unavoidable.
[3:15:04] <Xeno351> there are undodgeable situations you can put yourself in
[3:15:05] <Solidus_113> use roll and a blank at the same time
[3:15:06] <%megabrogus> megabrogus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Pat you're a trash human, but your content is top tier, and your discord community is awesome, so I'm re-subbing.
[3:15:06] <AvailDreams> Normally, if you make a bad roll, or you don't like a particular move
[3:15:09] <fearhurst> I only use my blanks on boss phases I dont understand yet
[3:15:09] <%skizzuto> use a blank in a situation where you think you're likely to get hit, like if you're cornered, or if you mess up a roll
[3:15:10] <+TopTieramisu> you gotta decide mid roll if you need a blank
[3:15:11] <%lazysaiyajin> @AngriestPat when you se a hail mary of bullets, not when u going to get hit
[3:15:11] <that_guy_from_high_school> Has pat unlocked the gunslinger yet?
[3:15:13] <+cvp5127> @AngriestPat try downloading now
[3:15:14] <+StrikeTheErf> I use them if it would give me a chance to focus on damage for a couple seconds
[3:15:15] <lovesosa236> obviously when your overwhelmed with bullets

[3:15:29] <%El_Desperad0> It's fine, Pat
[3:15:31] <mastermidget23> Only boss damage matters.

[3:17:30] <ShinobiPhoenix> I tricked my Switch into downloading the update. but I deleted the data and forced it to go from the eShop download option
[3:17:31] <fearhurst> Remember that you can preserve the sword with armor, and that you can destroy bullets by swinging
[3:17:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is pat checking to see if his smash update is going through yet?
[3:17:51] <fearhurst> Nah fortune is ass
[3:17:51] <+hootdoot> no, it's good
[3:17:55] <that_guy_from_high_school> Its temp bullet immunity.
[3:17:57] <+Emperor_Bad> oh its mgs fortune
[3:18:01] <that_guy_from_high_school> its just really short.

[3:18:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> nah not really
[3:18:23] <fearhurst> Fortune doesnt stop boss bullets very well
[3:18:25] <televisedrevolting> Anything bladed is considered heresy. That's why your sword is named Blasphemy. @angriestpat
[3:18:31] <fearhurst> if they have special properties
[3:18:45] <ShinobiPhoenix> I may have to wait a bit, but it won't be any longer than have to wait for the servers to not be fucked anyway.
[3:18:46] <%ElenaManetta> god you feel so powerful with the bullet
[3:18:48] <Saltmeisterr> btw guys I beat all the pasts this weekend
[3:18:55] <+DrThwack> not even bladed

[3:20:06] <%ArcanumMBD> @Prism_Wing probably. I'm terrible with actor names
[3:20:08] <fearhurst> Think of bullats as something you can destroy when they transform

[3:22:13] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat It was, and you moved there
[3:22:14] <%Spydurman> not that fast
[3:22:14] <%Sulliman34> youre not perfectly invincible you dingleberry

[3:22:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat They warp around you, but since you're moving, you're moving INTO them. Gotta stand still
[3:22:42] <+Gundamguy64> it is a very weak effect
[3:22:49] <OkamiDude15> in the end it has to be this way
[3:22:52] <%StEmlosWater> TRY UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
[3:22:53] <%AbnormalVoid> like, the game wouldn't just make you invincible lmao
[3:22:54] <%Sulliman34> joker is out if you want him pat

[3:24:37] <%ElenaManetta> I love whenever you get angry, you pause the game in a split second
[3:24:42] <Solleggi> oh fuck i finally made a strem

[3:24:56] <%Sulliman34> some nights yorue just off your game dude, it happens
[3:24:57] <%Niney_Who> Losing HP is just the game forcing you to use a limited consumable
[3:25:01] <%Niney_Who> So pat hates it
[3:25:01] <+HellfireComms> i won't get mii costumes tbh. I've been spoiled by having the characters I actually wanted in the game properly
[3:25:02] <OkamiDude15> its ez just vineSchut
[3:25:07] <+NoGoodAtGames> @AngriestPat git gud?
[3:25:08] <mor3gan> this is why i dont play from soft games
[3:25:09] <starotter70> Apparently the server error is because of a scheduled maintenance check, not because of the downloading
[3:25:21] <%Fenlig> That sword seems really good
[3:25:21] <%ThePuddingDead> What up nerds!
[3:25:26] <+TopTieramisu> the difficulty of fromsoft games are overblown

[3:25:37] <starotter70> LUL
[3:25:40] <acexclover> well they shouldnt fucking take all my dlc characters away @starotter70
[3:25:44] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat if you wanna release that aggression every time you get hit, try playing Convict
[3:25:45] <%ElenaManetta> You have three guns though
[3:25:45] <benjiFG> poison
[3:25:48] <Ion_Laser> This is the Practice Run. It's still good!
[3:25:50] <Onamar> The sword isn't THAT good. You can play him like a normal character without it
[3:25:50] <%ElenaManetta> And you still are invincible to touch
[3:25:51] <$Piemono> poison
[3:25:52] <+TopTieramisu> poisoned LUL
[3:25:53] <%Sulliman34> pat you are flustered and overwhelmed, take a break dude
[3:25:55] <%0dokuro> Pat youre gonna make mistakes its fine
[3:25:56] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Persona were better than sonic ones though
[3:25:56] <%joylent_blue> why would they schedule server maintenance right when a new DLC gets released
[3:25:58] <fearhurst> There's shit all over the floor
[3:25:58] <$Mendin> The Bullet is a character that acutely rubs on Pat's Goblins
[3:26:00] <+bear_breaker20> Blasphemy
[3:26:00] <%AbnormalVoid> in your hitbox
[3:26:00] <%Niney_Who> Oh you'd hate Bullet's Past
[3:26:01] <%MonsieurHedge> just play him like azazel lmao
[3:26:05] <leviathan666303> you walkde in the poison
[3:26:06] <FatherGreyBeard> My download is starting to work :)
[3:26:09] <+TopTieramisu> pat is losing the light in his eyes
[3:26:10] <starotter70> @acexclover Don't know what to tell you man
[3:26:12] <+mariomarc> Nintendo finished it's server repairs, so you might be able to update Smash now, that was the issue
[3:26:20] <+linSP> yeah sometimes the level hazards just blend in to the background
[3:26:21] <acexclover> i dont know either
[3:26:25] <%ElenaManetta> @AngriestPat you have HP you forgot to pick up in the other room
[3:26:33] <$Piemono> Middle of the floor was a poison puddle
[3:26:33] <mayorrev> Convict's got a great kit for getting hit a lot
[3:26:37] <+bear_breaker20> love his little butt cape <3
[3:26:38] <acexclover> and no one can help me from nintendo eithee
[3:26:44] <fearhurst> If pat doesnt see hazards how did he beat marine
[3:26:51] <%spiritofmojave> I'd download the update if the Eshop would bloody well function
[3:26:51] <%ArcanumMBD> Careful not to break the halo while using the luxin canon KappaHD
[3:26:54] <fearhurst> did paige do it
[3:26:56] <acexclover> ive uninstalled and reinstalled the game 3 times now
[3:27:04] <%Sulliman34> use your guns pat
[3:27:10] <%ElenaManetta> WHY DO YOU dO THAT EVERY TIEM
[3:27:12] <%ThePuddingDead> just started playing this and I cannot take out Kill Pillars...
[3:27:19] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:27:22] <+TopTieramisu> i don't know
[3:27:25] <OkamiDude15> there are times when i honestly cant tell if the floor tile is a pit or just textured darker than usual
[3:27:25] <fearhurst> The sword projectile is for things that explode
[3:27:26] <+HellfireComms> lmao the WORST challenge for pat right now
[3:27:34] <+linSP> OOO
[3:27:38] <%ElenaManetta> NICE
[3:27:43] <%Sulliman34> @ThePuddingDead theyre really rough, best thing i can recommend is using and explosive weapon to open holes in their patterns
[3:27:44] <+TopTieramisu> welp
[3:27:46] <Ion_Laser> Nice
[3:27:47] <+HellfireComms> nevermind!
[3:27:51] <+TopTieramisu> ooooo
[3:27:53] <+TopTieramisu> this gun
[3:27:55] <mayorrev> dude for real play as the convict, you get a damage buff every time you get hit
[3:27:56] <$Piemono> While the benefit drops off at later levels, the sword is still a great Defense item for certain boss stages
[3:27:56] <fearhurst> ass cannon
[3:27:59] <$Mendin> That's what we like to call BIG damage
[3:28:04] <%Sulliman34> laser rifle is alright
[3:28:06] <$Mendin> Check if the shop has a -yessss
[3:28:08] <%Sulliman34> doesnt really carry past floor 3
[3:28:08] <Saltmeisterr> do it perfect
[3:28:14] <Monsterstalker74> this gun fucks, big power
[3:28:16] <+TopTieramisu> health upgrade tho
[3:28:17] <%ElenaManetta> Badge!!!!
[3:28:17] <benjiFG> get monster blood
[3:28:18] <%Sulliman34> monster blood is niiiice
[3:28:19] <mayorrev> buddy cop!
[3:28:20] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah, trying to play through with Pilot, I know, he's shit, but I figure if I can get through with the worst character, the others will be easier
[3:28:26] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat Monster Blood is really good!
[3:28:27] <%Sulliman34> pilot isnt shit
[3:28:28] <%PaladinDupre> Pats entire gameplay style is a glass cannon, no matter how strong he is if he gets hit he breaks
[3:28:28] <%El_Desperad0> Monster Blood tho
[3:28:28] <+TopTieramisu> monster blood will also make you immune to poison
[3:28:28] <+Fynale> can't you turn the glass into something
[3:28:29] <$Mendin> @AngriestPat Buy one Glass Guon Stone before the boss fight and it'll prevent the first hit from draining the Glass Cannon's ammo
[3:28:29] <Saltmeisterr> monster blood dude
[3:28:29] <fearhurst> monster blood is poison immune I think
[3:28:30] <+DrThwack> i love laser lily, her default weapon has a relatively high rate of fighter
[3:28:32] <+DrThwack> fire*
[3:28:35] <%ElenaManetta> YES!
[3:28:38] <%ElenaManetta> Two for the price of ONE
[3:28:39] <%ElenaManetta> aw
[3:28:42] <+DrThwack> so her dps vs first bosses is amazing
[3:28:52] <fearhurst> badge is cool but you get more curse when the effect takes place
[3:29:01] <%Bigfado287> Bigfado287 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Happy Before Your Day Birth you freakzilla. Keep on rockin you genetic freak!
[3:29:02] <%Sulliman34> @ThePuddingDead if youre playing pilot you have the best chance of all the characters in the oubliette. use youre 2 keys to open the trapdoor and lockpick any chests you come across
[3:29:11] <slix343> Those bullets sound so sad when they die : (
[3:29:18] <%Sulliman34> the extra floor will bring you a lot more power scaling
[3:29:35] <+DrThwack> but man
[3:29:37] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah, i found that tonight, so it's best to go through the obliette with pilot each time?
[3:29:59] <%ElenaManetta> Has Pat ever gotten the Golden Ticket item yet?
[3:30:04] <%ElenaManetta> To summon the Bird?
[3:30:09] <mayorrev> its a poison river yeah
[3:30:11] <fearhurst> Pilot is best for bonus levels in general
[3:30:15] <+Jaysky> That bullet has a nice buttlet
[3:30:16] <+TopTieramisu> pilot generally has the easiest path to getting the rat key
[3:30:16] <+DrThwack> reaching the old king is so painful
[3:30:17] <fearhurst> Rat espexially
[3:30:22] <%Sulliman34> @ThePuddingDead generally yes, unless you get like a rainbow chest on floor 1 or dark chest. oubliette is an extra floor thats not too difficult in comparison
[3:30:27] <leviathan666303> green chest
[3:30:27] <televisedrevolting> So apparently the Bullet Kin have organs.
[3:30:32] <fearhurst> Pilot and Bullet are best for rat runs
[3:30:41] <%ThePuddingDead> i found a friggin glitched out chest last night...it was bizarre
[3:30:49] <mayorrev> yo any fellow convict mains gimme a he;; yea in the chat
[3:30:53] <mayorrev> hell*
[3:30:55] <%ThePuddingDead> had to fight double beholster.. with my starter pistol
[3:31:09] <fearhurst> least popular character
[3:31:09] <+TopTieramisu> double beholster is mad bs
[3:31:23] <+DrThwack> hell yea @mayorrev
[3:31:25] <+TopTieramisu> i like convict, but not playing as her
[3:31:28] <%Sulliman34> i like pilot's starting pistol more than convict's shotgun tbh
[3:31:28] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah i basically got robbed
[3:31:31] <%Sulliman34> i dont like convict at all
[3:31:33] <+DrThwack> the convict is the coolest looking cahracter too
[3:31:33] <OkamiDude15> double beholster or double ammoconda
[3:31:43] <%Sulliman34> i despise ammoconda
[3:31:53] <+HellfireComms> convict is probably my second most used one just due to that buff you get on being hurt
[3:31:58] <mayorrev> convict's kit isnt the best but i appreciate it and i will rep her till i die
[3:32:02] <+HellfireComms> Pilot I don't think I've beaten more than two floors with
[3:32:02] <%ThePuddingDead> ammoconda is rough
[3:32:03] <fearhurst> Ammoconda is hated by every player, only boss with no pattern
[3:32:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 1 key 2 chests
[3:32:10] <+DrThwack> i barely use pilot
[3:32:10] <%Niney_Who> Ammoconda is the worst
[3:32:11] <%RNGbob> AYY made it before midnight. Merry birthday Pat
[3:32:13] <%ElenaManetta> What are youuuu uthinking
[3:32:13] <+DrThwack> but rn
[3:32:14] <%Xatekken> Xatekken subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Thanks for the all the great content bud.
[3:32:14] <%ThePuddingDead> i made it 4 floors with him, that's about it
[3:32:18] <ghostravens> any hunter mains here? i love going hunter
[3:32:23] <%Sulliman34> pilot has best scaling, marine has best starting, hunter is a close 2nd
[3:32:28] <%ElenaManetta> Fight the boss and see if you get a key
[3:32:30] <benjiFG> green
[3:32:31] <%AncelDeLambert> armor
[3:32:33] <fearhurst> Even speedrunners lose the no-hit to ammoconda
[3:32:35] <coreybom> go for the gate, it might have a key inside.
[3:32:37] <%Sulliman34> i love hunter's crossbow as a first floor room2room
[3:32:37] <+TopTieramisu> i'm generally a marine main
[3:32:38] <$Mendin> Armorbrown
[3:32:40] <televisedrevolting> @ghostravens Ye.
[3:32:40] <+DrThwack> i think hunter has been my most played class lately since the latest patch
[3:32:42] <%ThePuddingDead> hunter's fun, but pilot....i dunno, so far its Marine, Convict, Hunter, Pilot
[3:32:43] <%lazysaiyajin> youre not getting hit, so green
[3:32:43] <+TopTieramisu> even though the marine is pretty dull
[3:32:43] <%ElenaManetta> Unless you think one of those chests is gonna make or break the fight
[3:32:46] <+Fynale> BIG IRON
[3:32:47] <+DrThwack> actually i lied
[3:32:47] <+hootdoot> open one, break the other
[3:32:49] <%Niney_Who> BIG Iron on his hip
[3:32:50] <$Mendin> Big Irony
[3:32:54] <+DrThwack> its been the bulelt
[3:32:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Gasp!
[3:32:55] <%PaladinDupre> BIIIIG IRON
[3:32:57] <fearhurst> Shit iron
[3:32:57] <OkamiDude15> with the big iron on his hip vineSchut
[3:32:58] <mayorrev> big iron on his hiiiiiiip
[3:33:01] <+critfumble_> pats here to do some buisness!
[3:33:02] <leviathan666303> biig iron'
[3:33:03] <%ElenaManetta> Rainbow Run is what you do if you want a passive build
[3:33:05] <person181> no big gun time
[3:33:07] <%Sulliman34> pilot gets better as you get better at the game! its very interesting how his lockpick goes from "oh thats nice" to "oh thats amazing"
[3:33:12] <Swaron__> nanomachines
[3:33:13] <%ThePuddingDead> oh no....
[3:33:14] <janitor_tulkas> If you can unlock gunslinger, it blows all other classes out of the water as far as I'm concerned.
[3:33:14] <%ElenaManetta> oh fuck this boss
[3:33:15] <%Sulliman34> FUCK the mineflayer
[3:33:15] <%ThePuddingDead> this asshole
[3:33:19] <%ElenaManetta> With NO FUCKING COVER
[3:33:21] <%El_Desperad0> FUCK this guy
[3:33:22] <fearhurst> This boss fight wants you to stand still
[3:33:24] <%ElenaManetta> This is the worst fucking boss with no cover
[3:33:26] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:33:30] <+HellfireComms> you got fucked hard here
[3:33:38] <televisedrevolting> Piece o shiy
[3:33:39] <lionmanguy> You have an s tier gun
[3:33:39] <Solidus_113> if only you had blanks...
[3:33:42] <fearhurst> Its counter intuitive as hell but you're supposed to stand still
[3:33:42] <lionmanguy> Why are you not using it
[3:33:43] <Ion_Laser> wtf with this boss
[3:33:45] <%Sulliman34> use......the bees.......
[3:33:45] <+HellfireComms> I've never even seen this boss with no cover
[3:33:45] <televisedrevolting> *shit fuck
[3:33:45] <%ElenaManetta> Bees are good here
[3:33:48] <+TopTieramisu> yeah this boss is pretty tough
[3:33:49] <that_guy_from_high_school> BLANKS YOU FOOL
[3:33:50] <$Piemono> There's a version of this boss room that has 4 pillars in it, and it totally trivializes the fight
[3:33:53] <%ElenaManetta> But I don't think Pat is gonna look at chat in time to see that
[3:33:53] <kingdudeby> Man I could never get anywhere in Gungeon
[3:34:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh hey looks like I'm finally getting to download Joker
[3:34:04] <mayorrev> pat's tilting, i can see it
[3:34:07] <fearhurst> The bell that flashes red is the boss
[3:34:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@benjiFG) (warning)
[3:34:18] <+Jaysky> Not the bees
[3:34:24] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat I did look up some new tricks, turns out if you switch your active gun with another, you wont have to reload either, just shoot with one gun, switch, shoot with that one, switch, never have to reload
[3:34:24] <+HellfireComms> @kingdudeby just gotta keep at it. I could not get past floor 2 at first, but eventually I managed to get to the fifth and final one
[3:34:28] <+TopTieramisu> this is a tough boss to figure out for the first time
[3:34:29] <Xeno351> so has won runs before and just rusty or is he just kinda............
[3:34:35] <person181> more bees
[3:34:36] <+SolverCODO> They're in my ass! My aaaaaaaaaass!!
[3:34:37] <LaughingStockLS> go pat go!
[3:34:40] <%AncelDeLambert> bees rule, but only when you have synergy
[3:34:45] <+SolverCODO> OOF
[3:34:48] <+whiskey_wolfe_> crikey
[3:34:49] <fearhurst> TILT
[3:34:49] <+TopTieramisu> woof
[3:34:50] <%ElenaManetta> What???
[3:34:50] <LaughingStockLS> NOO
[3:34:52] <allanmiri> The more I watch this the more i remember i suck at bullet hells
[3:34:53] <Hellarussian> uuuuunlucky
[3:34:53] <%ElenaManetta> That's wroth two hits?
[3:34:54] <%athuramn> awww
[3:34:54] <%korth367> check dat smash?
[3:35:02] <+Jaysky> Shot through the heart!
[3:35:02] <JrSpore> unlucky dude
[3:35:04] <%ElenaManetta> Have you done Rainbow Run yet?
[3:35:04] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> vargSad
[3:35:04] <%athuramn> anyways, an update
[3:35:04] <+SolverCODO> Because of the tilt
[3:35:05] <%blastazoid26> Bess with electric bullets are the shit
[3:35:06] <%ThePuddingDead> has he beaten the game yet?
[3:35:08] <OkamiDude15> da goblins
[3:35:12] <person181> bullet is a nerd
[3:35:13] <%athuramn> nintendo: We are aware that players are experiencing errors accessing Nintendo eShop and are working to address the problem. Thank you for your understanding and we hope to share an update when available.
[3:35:14] <+HellfireComms> you got fucked hard with this boss in particular
[3:35:16] <$Mendin> It encourages you to sword too much and it ends badly
[3:35:19] <%Salvation122> Because you're trying to get cute
[3:35:20] <Prism_Wing> Different playstyle.
[3:35:20] <beltedham> blanks
[3:35:20] <%El_Desperad0> You don't utilize the sword a lot
[3:35:21] <allanmiri> good run
[3:35:22] <Hellarussian> its the nerves
[3:35:23] <$Mendin> Try Paradox and just embrace GUN
[3:35:23] <%skizzuto> just play him like you normally would and you'll play better
[3:35:24] <+HellfireComms> yeah don't rely on the sword
[3:35:24] <Solidus_113> tilt on perfection, too much sword
[3:35:24] <%Salvation122> Try to abuse the block
[3:35:28] <%AncelDeLambert> because you're focused on the no hit run and are getting frustrated, duh
[3:35:31] <%korth367> @AngriestPat i think servers are slowing funneling people at this point
[3:35:31] <%Salvation122> You are trying to abuse the block, I mean
[3:35:34] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Boy...roguelikes sure are a very fun, rewarding experience. Aren't they Pat?
[3:35:37] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat try PARADOX
[3:35:40] <+DrThwack> sword seems ass after the first boss
[3:35:41] <$Piemono> It happens, I've had near perfect runs that fall to shit over the course of two random rooms
[3:35:41] <%lazysaiyajin> @AngriestPat example, when mine falyers initiates 3 waves of bouncy projectiles, thats a good time to use blanks. "its gonna be a hard time". use blanks
[3:35:44] <janitor_tulkas> I've found that over-reliance on Blasphemy tends to make a player sloppy.
[3:35:44] <+hootdoot> i've gotten to bullet's past like 3 times and get fucked every single time because not having the projectile ruins me
[3:35:46] <+DrThwack> like its good against mobs
[3:35:50] <mayorrev> F
[3:35:51] <%amilie3> need more gun
[3:35:55] <frozenottsel> You're not bad at Bullet, Bullet is bad at you : D
[3:35:56] <%El_Desperad0> The sword is important for the bullet with and without laser
[3:35:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[3:35:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat it's off and on, just try until it works
[3:35:58] <Yeajow> Spam it
[3:36:00] <%connos_livereview> just jobbed to bloody palaces lvl 87 DMD furies
[3:36:05] <+DrThwack> but only time i use blasphey is versus bullet king or gatling gull
[3:36:06] <+BlancoRico> nintendos getting DDoSd
[3:36:12] <+Jaysky> Looking COOOOL Jok- An Error has occured.
[3:36:15] <+DrThwack> mad iffy vs bullet twins
[3:36:16] <%ThePuddingDead> so who's the tiny bullet?
[3:36:23] <Hellarussian> you just need to get gooder at the videogame
[3:36:29] <%SrG00SE> nintendo getting ddosd by their good god damn product
[3:36:29] <@commanderclaw> Don't listen to us
[3:36:29] <%logoth_> Advice will cost you 5 save rings
[3:36:30] <%hrudzie_1> hrudzie_1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:36:33] <%solomonpun> Nintendo's power of starting strong and falling off a cliff at the end is amazing.
[3:36:33] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat give PARADOX a try
[3:36:35] <DankDunk> use blanks pre-emptively
[3:36:36] <%El_Desperad0> Save them for bosses
[3:36:40] <+Zxtole> If you think you might be in danger, use it
[3:36:44] <$Mendin> You can use a blank mid-dodge
[3:36:44] <benjiFG> if you fuck up a roll then use a blank
[3:36:44] <a_mad_dragon> oh god this is necrodancer all over again
[3:36:44] <fearhurst> Use blanks when you dont think you can dodge it
[3:36:46] <%Niney_Who> Blanks are Armor to prevent taking damage
[3:36:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat 5 save rings first
[3:36:50] <Solidus_113> don't ever believe in yourself, roll and blank at the same time
[3:36:50] <%Sulliman34> its all about danger-assesment
[3:36:54] <+HellfireComms> it's an instinct thing
[3:36:54] <%brickwall35> no you're not
[3:36:58] <+DrThwack> I'd use blanks when I'm in the corner and I have little room to dodge roll
[3:36:58] <Onamar> use it if you fuck up a roll
[3:36:58] <%low_hell_key> its 4 am and i can't sleep help
[3:36:58] <%hrudzie_1> prioritize blanks for secret rooms, then bosses
[3:36:59] <%ElenaManetta> If you're just getting overwhelmed and you're like I NEED A BREAK, you use it
[3:36:59] <%brickwall35> but you can't
[3:37:00] <%Sulliman34> what you CAN do is roll and then blank if you fuck up the roll
[3:37:00] <%MagickBurritoh> don
[3:37:02] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat then a blank wont save you in that situation. You need to be aware of hard to dodge patterns
[3:37:03] <+ReidTheReader> Use it when a boss uses a big move
[3:37:03] <%PaladinDupre> Use blanks when you think you might be able to dodge it but dont feel like trying
[3:37:03] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat it happens my man
[3:37:03] <janitor_tulkas> Dodging should always be your last option, pattern memorization and blanks should be your go to.
[3:37:04] <+JustAnotherMuffin> @AngriestPat Just use king crimson to see if you need to use it
[3:37:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:37:05] <%Niney_Who> Well then you los
[3:37:06] <$i_am_therydon> but what if you need it for later?
[3:37:08] <+Zxtole> Or if you mess up a roll and see, you're not in danger unless a shot is coming and you can't evade or the chances are low
[3:37:09] <Foymic> oh then just dodge it :)
[3:37:11] <Prism_Wing> gamble
[3:37:11] <%blastazoid26> When you think it's too overwhelming
[3:37:13] <$Mendin> Mid-dodge if you realize "FUCK!", hit the blank
[3:37:15] <+ReidTheReader> Minimize risk
[3:37:15] <leviathan666303> learn to be a coward
[3:37:16] <ToastedAeolo> takes practice to recognize what you can and can't dodge through
[3:37:16] <%MagickBurritoh> use blanks when the screen is filled
[3:37:18] <%SrG00SE> accept you arent going to dodge it then use the situation to your advantage
[3:37:19] <+moondog_> have you tried turning it off and back on?
[3:37:19] <%skizzuto> blank in situations where it's harder than usual to dodge, like if you're in a corner
[3:37:19] <%Salvation122> If you would roll, use blanks
[3:37:23] <%logoth_> just use them as soonas you get them then
[3:37:24] <%Ascethetic> Premptive not reactive
[3:37:24] <%luckybudman> Use them to commit to fucking up
[3:37:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat hit the enemy and dont get hit ok?
[3:37:26] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat use the blank when you think "this might be tricky to dodge"
[3:37:27] <%SrG00SE> you use them to create opportunity
[3:37:30] <mechslayer71> Ah shit, here we go again.
[3:37:31] <$Piemono> If you have trouble with a boss phase, use a blank
[3:37:34] <+DrThwack> whaaaat
[3:37:34] <mayorrev> Everything can be dodged, but it doesn't mean you always will @AngriestPat
[3:37:36] <linklol321> Say you wont dodge and let crazy talk play the game
[3:37:38] <fearhurst> Some patterns are intended for you to not dodge roll, like the mine flayer.
[3:37:40] <+DrThwack> i didnt know you can use a blank mid dodge
[3:37:40] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat you have this bad habit of asking for help, using a situation, and when people tell you how to handle that situation, you give a defeatist statement as if you're only flaw is your playing ability...
[3:37:42] <+DrThwack> that rules
[3:37:43] <bruno_silv0> if the patern is way too risky pop the blanks
[3:37:46] <%blastazoid26> Blanks are just consumable items
[3:37:49] <%Niney_Who> Blank for Panic
[3:37:53] <%MagickBurritoh> Git Gud
[3:37:54] <%ElenaManetta> Also, do Rainbow Runs if you want to do passive runs. They allow you to stack passive items to high heaven.
[3:37:55] <+ReidTheReader> Use it when a boss uses a big move
[3:37:55] <CassidyAlacrity> I use them as a means of skipping bullet patterns i hate
[3:37:57] <televisedrevolting> If you recognize a pattern you always get hit on, use it.
[3:37:59] <ToastedAeolo> Some things are trickier than others haha
[3:38:11] <ToastedAeolo> You should be able to kinda tell that you're dodging into a bullet
[3:38:11] <%Niney_Who> Fear
[3:38:13] <hussdogrob> if you know there are some patterns you always get hit on use the on those
[3:38:13] <%SrG00SE> just based on oh fuck thats a lot of bullets
[3:38:14] <%ElenaManetta> You don't, you get hit twice and then go FUCK I NEED A BREAK and use it
[3:38:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ULTRA INSTINCT
[3:38:15] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you need to be aware of your own hubris
[3:38:15] <Solidus_113> fear
[3:38:16] <Onamar> If you can see you're going to LAND on a bullet
[3:38:17] <OkamiDude15> panick
[3:38:17] <+hootdoot> gut instinct, fear reaction
[3:38:17] <Foymic> sometimes dodge looks hard so i give up and blank it
[3:38:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat stuff that always/usually hits you
[3:38:20] <benjiFG> if you dodge and a bullet is coming your way after the dodge, blank
[3:38:21] <%velemi> know your own capabilities
[3:38:22] <fearhurst> Pattern you dont understand is blank, that's all
[3:38:23] <%Salvation122> You should blank in the same cases you would roll, generally
[3:38:24] <%Ascethetic> Literally fear
[3:38:25] <%Kenori> if you see some SHIT coming and you would rather have the breathing room, blank it
[3:38:26] <Twoiis> I would just prioritize it when I'm low on life.
[3:38:32] <Prism_Wing> i n s t i n c t
[3:38:32] <+megaotter> try to see a way through the bullets coming, if you cant see a clear path to dodge or weave through, you blank
[3:38:32] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat it's difficult, usually a form of calm panic
[3:38:34] <%skizzuto> spatial reasoning and experience
[3:38:34] <televisedrevolting> Whenever you feel your dick quiver
[3:38:34] <+Robo_Wizard1> you should be familiar enough with the patterns by now to know which ones hit you more often
[3:38:38] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat i suggest studying your hitbox, find out how close you can be from a bullet and see what doesnt hit you
[3:38:39] <+Emperor_Bad> if you die you should have blanked
[3:38:41] <milkforhoney> just blank for safety to get out of a corner or something lmao
[3:38:42] <grayjammer> I agree with pat. I cant blank on reflex
[3:38:44] <%SrG00SE> if you feel like you fucked it up blank
[3:38:46] <%blastazoid26> Ultra patstinct
[3:38:47] <%Niney_Who> Dodging ones doesn't mean never hits you
[3:38:50] <$Piemono> you just have to feel out how likely you think you are to avoid a spread with a dodge
[3:38:52] <12gagerager> If the dodge has a low probability of getting you out of harms way, ready to deploy a blank
[3:38:52] <alttab> ofcourse watching is different than playing
[3:38:54] <benjiFG> plan ahead
[3:38:56] <fearhurst> It's basically shoulda rolled, we can't really help you
[3:39:00] <%Kenori> if you see some SHIT coming and you would rather have the breathing room, blank it
[3:39:05] <OkamiDude15> camick woopsHmm
[3:39:07] <+SeanConnery94> just got here has he gotten to bullets past?
[3:39:09] <%brickwall35> Pat if you can't realize when you're about to get hit, you aren't good, it's just that simple
[3:39:12] <+HellfireComms> you may just have the kind of anxiety where improvising just isn't possible
[3:39:12] <%thecalvalierone> I just saw scott steiner tear pats ass apart. It made my week
[3:39:13] <hussdogrob> part of it is looking at your character the whole fight, you will hit less but dodge more
[3:39:14] <+SeanConnery94> thats a tough one
[3:39:15] <%AncelDeLambert> But Pat, it's super easy, all you have to do is git gud!
[3:39:21] <%Niney_Who> Why would you
[3:39:26] <%Salvation122> That's fine, though
[3:39:26] <%Niney_Who> Block when you're confident you'll be hit
[3:39:27] <copyritetm> well sometimes itll be trickier then normal to doge certain attacks, use it for things you arent 100% comfortable with
[3:39:27] <janitor_tulkas> Dodging should be used minimally in my opinion.
[3:39:29] <Solidus_113> bullet patterns that you'd rather not deal with should be blank'd
[3:39:29] <%lazysaiyajin> @AngriestPat certain attacks on a certain range are hard to evade. using mine flayer again, if youre near a wall, theres a high chance projectiles bounce back to you. but if youre nowhere near the walls. you can use your skills to dodge incoming projectiles
[3:39:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> crazy talk inbound
[3:39:34] <%ElenaManetta> When you DON'T feel like this, use a blank
[3:39:37] <$RubberFistFight> ITT - people who don't know about the stream tax and think everyone always plays perfect, just like them (narrator: they do not, in fact, play perfectly.)
[3:39:39] <janitor_tulkas> I prefer using blanks to dodging.
[3:39:56] <+Emperor_Bad> i started to just do it when i think 'oh this is going to be a pain to dodge' instead of 'oh im going to get hit' - channel your laziness
[3:39:59] <bruno_silv0> basicaly you have have to look at the patern and be able to tell "fuck too hard to dodge, pop blank"
[3:40:00] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat plan on which of the boss' moves you would get more damage by using a blank that to avoid.
[3:40:05] <+Entropy_Pants> I usually save my blanks for a botched dodge roll--when I can see mid roll that I will land on a bullet
[3:40:09] <%ElenaManetta> Map SUCKSSSS
[3:40:10] <fearhurst> Try to just don't dodge roll unless you literally can't walk around it
[3:40:12] <%ElenaManetta> you're a sucker if you buy a map
[3:40:12] <%brickwall35> @RubberFistFight shut up you white knight lmao
[3:40:13] <+Kuraikami3> If you react well enough, I think you can attempt dodging, then blank while rolling if you see your dodge won't make it to safety.
[3:40:20] <%Niney_Who> No not preemtively
[3:40:25] <%Niney_Who> You use it when it's most effective
[3:40:28] <+HellfireComms> or if you want the ultimate answer: stop thinking, start blanking. It's your get out of jail free card
[3:40:36] <Rhinoprotoss> The number go down
[3:40:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I personally find it hard to physically difficult to mash the sticks to use a blank with good timing
[3:40:42] <%ThePuddingDead> thats the point
[3:40:43] <$RubberFistFight> @brickwall35 white knight? lol, that's amusing.
[3:40:44] <Foymic> The game rewards you for no blanks i thought
[3:40:50] <%blastazoid26> The final boss
[3:40:52] <%Niney_Who> Inescapable disasters are when you mess up
[3:40:52] <Onamar> Master Rounds don't help you at all if you never actually need them by not being hit
[3:40:54] <fearhurst> The ammoconda is th only inescapable
[3:40:55] <OkamiDude15> i botched that dodge and see a bullet about to hit me imma blank
[3:40:59] <%Niney_Who> Or when you're in an unlucky spot
[3:41:00] <$Piemono> A no hit boss run also relies heavily on the bosses you get
[3:41:03] <%Salvation122> You can absolutely put yourself in a place where your only option is to blank
[3:41:04] <fearhurst> The final boss is easier than ammoconda
[3:41:06] <%Dr_DangerPhD> There are a couple bullet patterns that are honestly just easier to blank then try and dodgeroll through and take a hit on
[3:41:15] <%ElenaManetta> Ya'll are nuts, ammoconda is easy with Bullet
[3:41:15] <%athuramn> if you don't feel the threat of an inescapable disaster just consider it two lives
[3:41:15] <Saltmeisterr> omg I got the huntress stuck in the petting animation
[3:41:16] <milkforhoney> sometimes there is inescapable if you have bad positioning
[3:41:19] <Nolat885> @angriestpat think of them like a smart bomb
[3:41:20] <%ElenaManetta> Him bumping into you doesn't matter anymore!
[3:41:23] <%velemi> you can absolutely put yourself in an inescapable situation pat
[3:41:23] <%blastazoid26> Use all blanks on the wall. FUCK THE WALL
[3:41:27] <janitor_tulkas> Every boss has at least one attack (if not more) that I know I can't dodge 100% of the time that I specifically save blanks for.
[3:41:30] <fearhurst> Just dont get hit by the drago
[3:41:31] <$Piemono> You def need the hearts for the 6th floor
[3:41:34] <%El_Desperad0> Dragun doesn't need blanks
[3:41:34] <%Niney_Who> Know what makes you not get hit?
[3:41:36] <%Niney_Who> Blanks
[3:41:37] <+hootdoot> master rounds also synergize with certain strong items
[3:41:41] <benjiFG> just play more touhou and you'll get it
[3:41:44] <Onamar> You can still win easily with only a few master rounds, or none at all if you get busted guns
[3:41:45] <fearhurst> you need hearts for hell but not the bosses
[3:41:55] <%Niney_Who> Ammoconda is a given
[3:41:56] <krymzen5> i finally killed the past!!!
[3:42:01] <%Niney_Who> Because Ammoconda has no pattern
[3:42:11] <ketchuo13> Yeah, the snake is a pain
[3:42:13] <%Salvation122> So use them for the first two
[3:42:14] <%Niney_Who> Ammoconda is the only truly random boss with no set patterns of attacks given it moves randomly around the room
[3:42:14] <a_mad_dragon> Ammoconda means you're not getting a master round, period
[3:42:16] <%Dr_DangerPhD> ammoconda is a lazy chase boss
[3:42:22] <Xeno351> use it early because if you get hit once who cares anymore
[3:42:23] <ghostravens> ammoconda sucks so much
[3:42:24] <+daisyyyy> Thats why its hard Pat
[3:42:24] <+HellfireComms> you're playing a game with a lot of RNG, sometimes you just get a bad roll
[3:42:24] <OkamiDude15> ammoconda is just ass
[3:42:26] <%skizzuto> just gotta git gud and pray for good luck sometimes
[3:42:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> I only use blanks on my last heart
[3:42:45] <+HellfireComms> like I was here for the one you won with marine. That was AMAZING luck. Armour out the ass, tons of health and the best guns. Sometimes that just doesn't happen
[3:42:47] <xiccy> ammoconda is a shit
[3:42:49] <talfurt> what was that switch on the wall
[3:42:49] <mechslayer71> Ammoconda is the roughest second boss, no doubt
[3:42:52] <fearhurst> Remember to walk in semicircles to avoid all attacks
[3:42:56] <%Niney_Who> Just open it
[3:42:56] <+hootdoot> has pat unlocked the oubliette?
[3:42:58] <%Niney_Who> It could be casey
[3:43:00] <$Piemono> smash them
[3:43:01] <%Niney_Who> and Casey good
[3:43:03] <janitor_tulkas> Just break the chests and hope you get Junkan
[3:43:05] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Break the chests
[3:43:06] <%ElenaManetta> What happened
[3:43:07] <%ElenaManetta> I looekd away
[3:43:20] <twin_triggers> just try to break boxes go for junken
[3:43:20] <benjiFG> don't get hit to avoid attacks
[3:43:20] <fearhurst> 2nd one
[3:43:22] <ghostravens> is ammoconda also the most common second floor boss? i swear i get them all the time
[3:43:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its called a Full Serpentine
[3:43:32] <hussdogrob> Pat one of the biggest pieces of advice I got was to never look at the boss during the fight but look at your character instead, at first it will cause you to miss a little bit more but you will get hit less, that keeps you from accidentally running into errant bullets. once you look at yourself you will start to get a better sense of what you can and what you cannot dodge due to multiple patterns overlapping for example
[3:43:34] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@televisedrevolt) (warning)
[3:43:34] <sunny_side_up> "semicircle" *spins in full circles immediately*
[3:43:38] <+SolverCODO> walk in a chain link infinity sign pattern
[3:43:39] <%ElenaManetta> If you do that while attackin
[3:43:40] <milkforhoney> this is hard to explain since pat is bad at wanting to use consumables
[3:43:44] <%ElenaManetta> You erase surrounding bullets
[3:43:48] <$Piemono> Kill the chests
[3:43:49] <bruno_silv0> there are paterns where you look at them and you know you are gonna get hit, you need to learn to be able to tell when those are happening
[3:43:56] <%connos_livereview> my ammoconda dont want non unless you got bombs hon
[3:44:02] <OkamiDude15> @ghostravens ive gotten gorgun more often than ammoconda on second floor
[3:44:04] <%lazysaiyajin> @hussdogrob true that
[3:44:14] <lionmanguy> What if its casey
[3:44:15] <benjiFG> but the Casey
[3:44:16] <%Niney_Who> Except for CASEY
[3:44:18] <%Salvation122> If you're not going to open them you might as well break them
[3:44:18] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat yeah and if you have aim assist on you should be able to worry less about looking at the boss
[3:44:22] <%Sulliman34> go oubliette

[3:44:25] <OkamiDude15> but pat what if its casey woopsMB
[3:44:26] <%El_Desperad0> Doesn't Junkan drop chance increases with breaking blue chests?
[3:44:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> yeah gorgun seems to be 2nd floor boss more often

[3:44:35] <InfiniteSwagbito> BELIEVE IT
[3:44:35] <fearhurst> walk in semicircles and break away when the shots get close. Semicircles break enemy tracking and allow you to avoid the sharpshooter enemies
[3:44:36] <mayorrev> Casey is fun but impractical
[3:44:38] <%bulletzok> wowee
[3:44:38] <mayorrev> tbqh
[3:44:38] <%Niney_Who> He says, using the Sword
[3:44:41] <Guntharius> brown chests have some of the best actives though, like double vision and potion of gunfriendship
[3:44:42] <%lazysaiyajin> BELIEVE IT

[3:45:15] <%Niney_Who> Reflect when distanced, Hit with bat when vulnerable
[3:45:17] <sunny_side_up> the answer is yes
[3:45:19] <%El_Desperad0> Triple damage for both
[3:45:20] <%Dr_DangerPhD> casey is a good weapon to kill yourself with if you don't know how to use it
[3:45:22] <fearhurst> Mostly the enemies, they become baseballs
[3:45:22] <benjiFG> casey does 100 damage on the swing

[3:46:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani?
[3:46:56] <+dualviper25> good but weak
[3:46:56] <+hootdoot> is Casey referencing Earthbound or the story that Earthbound is also referencing or both?

[3:47:13] <frozenottsel> you, did it
[3:47:14] <%ElenaManetta> They reload tho, so it's good after the map complete
[3:47:21] <%Niney_Who> The Big M Shaped one
[3:47:34] <%skizzuto> @hootdoot both maybe?
[3:47:41] <benjiFG> nice
[3:47:42] <%El_Desperad0> F
[3:47:43] <%Niney_Who> There's usually another one
[3:47:44] <%ElenaManetta> You broke the water
[3:47:47] <%ElenaManetta> I saw it
[3:47:48] <%Niney_Who> In a different room
[3:47:53] <%ElenaManetta> WAIT
[3:47:55] <%ElenaManetta> There are TWO barrells
[3:47:56] <+kamikazeturtleX> There's always two barrels
[3:47:57] <%ElenaManetta> On every map
[3:47:57] <Onamar> There could be a barrel in another room
[3:47:57] <%Dr_DangerPhD> look around there's usually a second barrel you can kick there
[3:48:06] <OkamiDude15> water broke. paige confirmed pregnant
[3:48:09] <%ElenaManetta> UNLESS you broke that ttoo
[3:48:09] <Lazy_Vagabond> not worth moving it all the way over
[3:48:10] <benjiFG> because you have no hands
[3:48:12] <NeroInfinite> It's too far
[3:48:15] <%Taisuru> Hey pat, did you watch Kamen Rider Gaim or was that Matt and Woolie? I can't recall.
[3:48:15] <%Salvation122> Wait what does the fireplace do
[3:48:18] <Foymic> try jumping in that water :)
[3:48:26] <+kamikazeturtleX> Pour some Red Bull on it
[3:48:32] <+dualviper25> just look around theres usually 2-3 spawns of water
[3:48:39] <fearhurst> @angriestpat Casey does 100 damage. Hitting explosive enemies delays their explosion so you can back away. Killed enemies become projectiles about as strong as the swing. Reflected bullets do 10 damage, which means that Spiders get fucked. Use it to hit other enemies primarily.
[3:48:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat you can reveal secret rooms wwith guns that are NOT the starter gun instead of blanks
[3:48:44] <sunny_side_up> goddamn the gungeon OST bops
[3:48:45] <OkamiDude15> @Salvation122 theres a lever you can activate after putting out the fireplace and it will open up a secret room
[3:48:45] <%ElenaManetta> IT SURE WILL
[3:48:49] <+hootdoot> @Salvation122 if you douse the fireplace you unlock a secret bonus level
[3:48:49] <%Niney_Who> Missed a room
[3:49:12] <+dualviper25> check end room
[3:49:13] <%Niney_Who> To the right
[3:49:14] <$Piemono> Oh well, next run then
[3:49:15] <%ElenaManetta> Does the shopkeeper have any liquid gun?
[3:49:17] <%Niney_Who> The center teleport room
[3:49:21] <%Cavumentum> Oh boy are we watching Pat die super hard
[3:49:26] <%Niney_Who> That one in the 3 triangular ones
[3:49:27] <+daisyyyy> wait so what good is the oubliette for anyways?

[3:58:03] <benjiFG> @AngriestPat grappling hook is free invincibility
[3:58:03] <fearhurst> embarassing
[3:58:04] <%ElenaManetta> The skeleton key is for the resourceful rat
[3:58:04] <+bear_breaker20> but why would they lie? Kappa
[3:58:05] <+Emperor_Bad> new PR tech
[3:58:06] <Superblooms> did he already get the primer?
[3:58:07] <LokimenD> oh how the mighty have fallen
[3:58:07] <+Zxtole> The content is a refund
[3:58:07] <+XxBTExX> Pretty sure the goddamn game doesnt work so pretending the internet doesnt work is fine.
[3:58:09] <person181> thanks plauge, amazing as always
[3:58:09] <dabeaminator> They are sooo going under
[3:58:10] <$RubberFistFight> At this point Bioware is dead and EA is just wearing their face skin as a leather mask.
[3:58:13] <%SrG00SE> whats in it? content! duh! now CONSUME
[3:58:16] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat did you see Bioware is hiring for like every possible position for Anthem?
[3:58:19] <Prism_Wing> @zxtole LUL
[3:58:20] <fearhurst> During hook flight you are invulnersble
[3:58:21] <NeroInfinite> E l D e R blank
[3:58:21] <Ion_Laser> Kotaku mention that at Bioware someone "cut" their fiber conneciton
[3:58:21] <%Jetsfantasy> They're pretending to be in a tunnel... for a month
[3:58:25] <NeroInfinite> Super cursed
[3:58:25] <%ElenaManetta> He's not cursed, is he?
[3:58:26] <%topendbuzz> I think bioware might be dead guys
[3:58:26] <%skizzuto> @Superblooms really expensive key that gets you to a secret boss fight on the third floor
[3:58:26] <mayorrev> yooo elder blank is the shit
[3:58:27] <%ElenaManetta> Or the elder blank is
[3:58:31] <stropbopadopolis> thats... patheetic, like flat out sad
[3:58:33] <+Tonku_the_Red> Bioware died the minute EA bought them.
[3:58:36] <Djinnazz> you should give rainbow mode a try.
[3:58:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> they should just embrace the fact that Anthem is a trash fire.
[3:58:40] <krymzen5> You'd have to pay me toplay tht trainwreck
[3:58:43] <+dualviper25> use them rolls boi
[3:58:44] <$RubberFistFight> @Jetsfantasy "can you hear me now? What about now? No you're still breaking up I can't-"
[3:58:44] <Djinnazz> run F'd.
[3:58:47] <fearhurst> SEMICIRCLES
[3:58:54] <VritraReiRei> @Monsterstalker74 nope, one of them HAS to be a master round to get to the R&G Dept.
[3:58:54] <bruno_silv0> people be saying bioware is gonna die soon but lets be real, bioware has been dead for a long time
[3:58:56] <mayorrev> a ghost?
[3:59:06] <$RubberFistFight> @rumtumtugnutz it reflects the state of their company, really.
[3:59:11] <%deviljhojho94> REEEEEEEE
[3:59:14] <%ElenaManetta> Attack
[3:59:15] <fearhurst> crescent moon
[3:59:18] <%ElenaManetta> You do it while attacking I believe
[3:59:20] <%MagickBurritoh> Serpentine
[3:59:21] <lionmanguy> No...while moving
[3:59:22] <+HellfireComms> stop listening to advice and just play normally, you can't adapt to other people's play styles
[3:59:25] <lionmanguy> Like serpentine
[3:59:25] <%ElenaManetta> And it's a 360 block
[3:59:31] <+bear_breaker20> omg that gun LUL
[3:59:48] <+HellfireComms> ...i'm aware of the irony of what i just said
[3:59:48] <NeroInfinite> I hate the screecher
[3:59:50] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Ragnarok_Flames subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> the only reason anyone gives a shit about Bioware is because they want Kotor 3.
[3:59:55] <Prism_Wing> What's so bad about the rectangle gun?
[3:59:55] <mayorrev> hail hydrate
[3:59:55] <OkamiDude15> okay so that new arrangement for aria of the soul is godlike SourPls

[4:00:12] <%windsoc> spider is bastard
[4:00:12] <+Emperor_Bad> i love old fashioned laser hoops
[4:00:17] <alttab> isnt it semi circles with sword?
[4:00:24] <+dualviper25> spder and jaguars are the worst
[4:00:26] <$RubberFistFight> @rumtumtugnutz I don't, not after what EA did with the last Star Wars game.
[4:00:30] <%ElenaManetta> It's going in a circle WITH the Sword WHILE attacking
[4:00:31] <leviathan666303> with the sword
[4:00:42] <%skizzuto> @AngriestPat you can drop your master round to get back to full health for the sword if you want, just pick it back up before you leave the floor
[4:00:42] <+bear_breaker20> idk ME and DA were good to me when i was little (Even tho i heave no faith in thier futures)
[4:00:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> just like Bethesda and the future dumpster fire that will be Elder Scrolls 6
[4:00:44] <mayorrev> its the REEEEE gun
[4:01:05] <+SolverCODO> Just like, think about it
[4:01:12] <dabeaminator> I thought the plan was Kiwami then Smash? Did I miss something?
[4:01:13] <%ElenaManetta> It's for blocking bullets, not for attacking perse
[4:01:20] <fearhurst> semicircle strafe
[4:01:22] <Saltmeisterr> its cycling back
[4:01:22] <%ElenaManetta> It's a 360 degree block if you spin
[4:01:34] <NeroInfinite> Smash is downloading @dabeaminator

[4:02:31] <%deviljhojho94> FOODER
[4:02:32] <AFlyingTaco1> So could people not even download the update?
[4:02:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> @rubberfistfight after bungie parted ways with Activision, a friend at work heard from somewhere Bioware was planning to do the same with EA.... it's not true, cause that would for sure be the death of Bioware.
[4:02:34] <fearhurst> damn
[4:02:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> but I mean
[4:02:45] <fearhurst> he did it
[4:02:48] <fearhurst> the blank
[4:02:50] <benjiFG> I clapped
[4:02:51] <Prism_Wing> Birdie
[4:02:54] <%Jetsfantasy> You can turn away from Gorgun when she does the stone attack too
[4:02:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> sometimes you just gotta let go.
[4:03:09] <$RubberFistFight> @rumtumtugnutz they should still do it so they can die on their own terms, tbh.
[4:03:10] <extradopeness> Burdy
[4:03:12] <%MagickBurritoh> gorgun pees in the pool huh
[4:03:12] <ShadeNightz> so what was he talking about when he mentioned you needing to drop master rounds
[4:03:16] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah cuz no one else would tolerate bioware's current bullshit
[4:03:20] <dabeaminator> This is clearly a ripoff of Dark Souls 2, I mean come o
[4:03:22] <+HellfireComms> NICE
[4:03:23] <%ElenaManetta> If you get the grappling hook... You can steal from the shop. But only once and then he gets fucking pissed.
[4:03:24] <+cawi> you can turn your character to face away to not get petrified.

[4:04:25] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Your Phoenix Synergy is a Eric Andre reference
[4:04:30] <%ElenaManetta> You went up COOL
[4:04:31] <mayorrev> fuck curse
[4:04:32] <%ElenaManetta> So you're balanced
[4:04:33] <person181> not the curse
[4:04:34] <%Dr_DangerPhD> elder blank is worth it
[4:04:34] <Prism_Wing> We're all cursed.
[4:04:37] <VritraReiRei> Elder Blank is amazing
[4:04:38] <mayorrev> elder blank is useful'

[4:04:47] <NeroInfinite> sipsipHonk
[4:04:48] <%Cthulos> everyone dies
[4:04:49] <%Niney_Who> It said BIRD UP
[4:04:50] <bruno_silv0> yo so apparently neil druckman shot the ending to the last of 2 so id count on that game coming our this year
[4:04:50] <%El_Desperad0> no
[4:05:06] <Rhinoprotoss> Number go down
[4:05:10] <%TheShal> BIRD SQUAD
[4:05:10] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat the synergy is called Phoenix Up
[4:05:14] <%brickwall35> BIRD UP, the best show on television
[4:05:16] <extradopeness> BIRD UP
[4:05:23] <%Niney_Who> I mean a Phoenix is a Bird
[4:05:29] <%Cthulos> slug down
[4:05:36] <mayorrev> the WOORST show
[4:05:43] <%El_Desperad0> It's not an eric andre reference
[4:05:51] <fearhurst> I am the smrtedt
[4:05:59] <%Niney_Who> Shush let it be an Eric Andre reference
[4:06:09] <%MagickBurritoh> pheonix up or pheonix down?
[4:06:09] <%ElenaManetta> What does?
[4:06:10] <a_mad_dragon> BLANKS
[4:06:19] <%Dr_DangerPhD> without any synergies the phoenix is probably the worst gun in the game
[4:06:33] <+cawi> bullet doesnt take contact damage from running into enemies right?
[4:06:35] <fearhurst> Elder shotgunkin are the enemies I tell you to semicirclesteafe
[4:06:40] <dabeaminator> I assumed it was a reference to Final Fantasy. You know, Phoenix Downs and all.
[4:06:55] <mentalysedated> Whats good Pat and chat!!!
[4:06:56] <televisedrevolting> Is Smash working yet?
[4:07:05] <fearhurst> no
[4:07:10] <+HellfireComms> be honest chat, how many years did it take you to realize that phoenix down = phoenix feather
[4:07:14] <+HellfireComms> as in the down of a bird
[4:07:23] <%ElenaManetta> i just want 6 hours of pat ripping on smash
[4:07:25] <televisedrevolting> Well damn
[4:07:26] <%logoth_> Too smelly for the switch
[4:07:28] <fearhurst> like 2 days
[4:07:30] <%Tredecian> a trickster some might say
[4:07:31] <%Cthulos> what happened with smash
[4:07:31] <Prism_Wing> In other words, crazy talk
[4:07:33] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[4:07:34] <OkamiDude15> a joke...er
[4:07:40] <Paperware> we patched the game wrong on purpose, as a joke
[4:07:47] <%Jetsfantasy> Smash's servers are like the players, smelly and have to go to bed by 9
[4:07:47] <+bear_breaker20> wish i could fucking own the games i buy these days jeez
[4:07:48] <%logoth_> Dont worry, the netcode is a JOKE anyway
[4:07:55] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so apparently big youtubers were able to get on, download the update and play perfectly whilst everyone else was getting sandbagged by "server problems". Dunno how true that statement is, but the cynic in me believes it.
[4:08:00] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @Cthulos every person who owns the game is basically DDOS'ing the servers trying to update it
[4:08:07] <fearhurst> Use Casey
[4:08:12] <fearhurst> with flak bullets
[4:08:16] <Djinnazz> FLAK
[4:08:19] <+SPplayer> I was able to get the patch about 25 minutes ago
[4:08:20] <%windsoc> that sounds good
[4:08:20] <fearhurst> it shoots
[4:08:26] <%manwithboxonhead> I can get behind that, not a really big smash person anyways.
[4:08:26] <%ElenaManetta> The wood gun though... it's so fucking dumb
[4:08:26] <person181> like the cannon?
[4:08:30] <fearhurst> oh wait wrong run
[4:08:30] <+dualviper25> super good
[4:08:32] <mayorrev> thats super strong iirc
[4:08:32] <Onamar> those are really good
[4:08:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RubberFistFight Man, I got the update just fine right at 9:00, and it seems like most people did then
[4:08:38] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[4:08:41] <dabeaminator> Seems like the patch is working now Pat
[4:08:46] <%ElenaManetta> WHEW
[4:08:49] <+dualviper25> LIVIN ON THE EDGE
[4:08:50] <%ElenaManetta> you ALMOST fell in

[4:08:53] <%ElenaManetta> We ALL SAW IT
[4:08:54] <Paradocks23> Scott Falco is playing and he's not a super big streamer. Pat gets more consistent views.
[4:09:02] <Solidus_113> it's not
[4:09:04] <+XxBTExX> nice you can bounce around a corner
[4:09:09] <mayorrev> lmao
[4:09:09] <TwinBat> ASMR
[4:09:13] <%MagickBurritoh> Don't believe their lies Pat
[4:09:14] <%ElenaManetta> Don't whisper into your mic unless you're gonna do it seductively, coward
[4:09:14] <%Cthulos> how does running an update out possibly ddos the server.
[4:09:19] <Prism_Wing> Those reflecting rectangles are an unsettling visual for me.
[4:09:21] <Schaloffindustries> nintendo never saw it coming
[4:09:22] <+dualviper25> 9 ,ims till 4 20 SMOKE UP
[4:09:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> whisper harder.
[4:09:30] <alttab> patch tingles
[4:09:31] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat it's really iffy. some people were able to get it working, some haven't
[4:09:32] <+XxBTExX> pretty sure smash will be dead for the next day or tow
[4:09:35] <scorpion12590> I was able to get the patch
[4:09:36] <%Niney_Who> The Servers are fucked because they scheduled maintenance at the exact same time as Joker releasing
[4:09:37] <%nooshy1> nooshy1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:09:39] <hussdogrob> give up on giving up
[4:09:39] <%ElenaManetta> QUIT IT

[4:09:48] <+cvp5127> its working on east coast
[4:09:49] <$RubberFistFight> @legendfather_of_giants the whole situation stinks tbh. The server seems to be yoyo-ing like crazy which in a way is worse than it just being down til it's "fixed".
[4:09:51] <Paradocks23> Really? I'm looking at smaller streamers play it right now...
[4:09:51] <linklol321> Just act like you didnt stop to check
[4:09:55] <OkamiDude15> sassy ginger whispers condescendingly into your ear at 1 in the morning woopsGasm
[4:09:59] <scorpion12590> Though its spotty still
[4:09:59] <%ShaneWhite> Guess you can say it was a JOKE
[4:10:01] <benjiFG> ew bullets
[4:10:03] <%StEmlosWater> This better not interferen with the masquerade
[4:10:07] <Schaloffindustries> G U N
[4:10:14] <%Jetsfantasy> Yeah, just tested it and can confirm, Nindy fucked up bad
[4:10:16] <forestfire44> Just got back... howd the no hit run go...
[4:10:16] <%ElenaManetta> PaTriCK I'M THE ONLY VIEWER WHO USES SPEAKERS WHEN I WATCH STREAMS. GOING FROM whisper where i have to turn up the volume TO TALKING NORMALLY BLASTS MY EAR HOLES
[4:10:19] <dabeaminator> It was the biggest lie. Sorry, it's working elsewhere.
[4:10:22] <$COLEZILLA> just got joker downloaded, only took an hour and a half of retrying the download
[4:10:23] <+Saggitori> @angriestpat crazy talk doesn't work if you believe it's going to work
[4:10:25] <+dualviper25> sword gets phased out stage 4 anyways
[4:10:46] <%Jetsfantasy> It's working if your subscriber amount has at least 5 digits Kappa
[4:10:49] <mentalysedated> Wow i keep seeing the little bat friend as an enemy and i don't know how to shake that,,,
[4:10:51] <Djinnazz> BS it does.
[4:10:56] <masso101> They’re not lying pat it just doesn’t work for you my man
[4:10:57] <$RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta wait, what? people don't use speakers?
[4:10:58] <+dualviper25> i never use it
[4:11:04] <Onamar> It stops being very strong unless you have tons of passives
[4:11:07] <%ElenaManetta> most clever nerds use headphones
[4:11:11] <poyanyo> is pat using mods
[4:11:13] <Monkeyweed21> sword is amazing unless you get hit
[4:11:15] <masso101> I’m playing classic mode with him right now
[4:11:27] <%ElenaManetta> The sword is at it's best when you stack up companion damage, let THEM do all the work while you just focus on living
[4:11:37] <%Cthulos> nintendo eshop is down for me LUL
[4:11:41] <fearhurst> Screeeeeexh
[4:11:47] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat it's a B tier "Gun." Can't expect a B Tier item to carry you throughout the whole run without a bunch of passives
[4:11:49] <+dualviper25> if you dont have op guns be stage 4 your run aint lookin good
[4:11:50] <$RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta [looks at 5.1 setup] Guess I'm not a clever nerd then. That's alright, I got massive ears and most headphones crush them painfully against the side of my skull.
[4:11:52] <televisedrevolting> Goddamit
[4:11:53] <%SrG00SE> mine just started working but i think i got lucky

[4:12:32] <%ElenaManetta> Pat is a distracting streamer. I was supposed to be done drawing two hours ago but then he started the only game I still play
[4:12:36] <LVDoomien> Hey Pat when yah stun somebody with the screecher you can probably swap to sword to finish them and save ammo
[4:12:37] <$RubberFistFight> lol
[4:12:56] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Just needs to find a fightsabre and its a gg lol easy run win
[4:13:05] <%SrG00SE> @ElenaManetta Pat's body should just be the basis for all of your art duh
[4:13:08] <mayorrev> oh boy
[4:13:16] <%ElenaManetta> Pat's body IS the basis for all my art
[4:13:23] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> So difficult
[4:13:24] <Djinnazz> lol
[4:13:25] <%ElenaManetta> You can DROP IT
[4:13:26] <NeroInfinite> rip
[4:13:26] <fearhurst> nice tradh
[4:13:26] <Lulu19> LOL
[4:13:28] <Solidus_113> CURSE
[4:13:28] <%Laecerelius> drop it
[4:13:29] <anar_bael> noice
[4:13:30] <OkamiDude15> Jebaited
[4:13:31] <VritraReiRei> drop it
[4:13:35] <%El_Desperad0> It's a good gun
[4:13:35] <Onamar> Huntsman is good
[4:13:36] <anar_bael> LUL
[4:13:37] <%spiritofmojave> Huntsman is fine?
[4:13:45] <VritraReiRei> It's not good
[4:13:48] <%clausover> you can just drop it @AngriestPat
[4:13:52] <%Cthulos> curse
[4:14:01] <%ElenaManetta> But you're +1 cool, so aren't you only +1 curse?
[4:14:02] <%spiritofmojave> Ah, that makes sense then
[4:14:08] <fearhurst> I want to see el Paton fight the rat
[4:14:09] <Paradocks23> what do curse weapons do?
[4:14:11] <%ElenaManetta> Doesn't the cool and curse meter balance out?
[4:14:19] <%clausover> no
[4:14:21] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Huntsman is good to hold onto incase you have to fight the wall boss
[4:14:23] <Lulu19> KINDA ASS LOOT
[4:14:25] <VritraReiRei> 3 Curse is a lot Kappa
[4:14:26] <mayorrev> yo table blanks are good
[4:14:27] <%ElenaManetta> Oh, I always thought it did
[4:14:30] <+bear_breaker20> Been playing this game for hours already lmao wut even is cool/curse
[4:14:34] <mayorrev> the SLING
[4:14:38] <%ElenaManetta> WHAT
[4:14:41] <%spiritofmojave> Cooldown reduces item cooldown I think
[4:14:41] <$mrhappy6677> So what did I miss?
[4:14:42] <VritraReiRei> Sling PogChamp
[4:14:42] <%ElenaManetta> The Sling fucking sucks
[4:14:43] <anar_bael> Ah the sling, decent
[4:14:49] <%spiritofmojave> *coolness
[4:14:49] <lloyddboy> DO SLING
[4:14:51] <mayorrev> sling is baller
[4:14:54] <%Jetsfantasy> @bear_breaker20 Coolness is active item cooldown reduction
[4:14:54] <Onamar> @ElenaManetta Sling does massively increased damage to bosses
[4:14:55] <TigerFlavoredCereal> ? Sling is ok
[4:14:55] <+yayaoi> malfChuck
[4:14:58] <%Cthulos> sling is okay early
[4:15:04] <%ElenaManetta> Sling is so slow
[4:15:08] <+whiskey_wolfe_> That's just a dang tank
[4:15:14] <%El_Desperad0> Sling sucks without alpha and/or omega bullets
[4:15:18] <%Dr_DangerPhD> with fat bullets the sling is godlike
[4:15:20] <+cawi> @bear_breaker20 cool I think increases better drop rate. Curse has a rating from 1-10. When it hits 10 an enemy chases you through rooms. Also higher chance of stronger enemies.
[4:15:21] <TigerFlavoredCereal> I tuned into the stream because Joker wasn't downloading
[4:15:21] <%ArcanumMBD> @ElenaManetta some things like chests having fuses, and chest rewards from rooms use both cool and curse in the calculation, so in those they cancel out. but you still get all the curse-specific things
[4:15:23] <%manwithboxonhead> Shit
[4:15:23] <%Jetsfantasy> If only there was some kind of machine gun sling
[4:15:26] <fearhurst> Cool reduces a side effect of curse, changing your drops into ammo. Coolness also increases drop chance
[4:15:29] <TigerFlavoredCereal> But now he is
[4:15:33] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Ho ho ho
[4:15:36] <benjiFG> wow where did the bullets go
[4:15:48] <Djinnazz> Awww
[4:15:49] <kingra> FUCK
[4:15:49] <%ElenaManetta> IT'S OKAY PAL
[4:15:51] <Captain_Joe1911> :O
[4:15:51] <%NovaKnightmare> OOF
[4:15:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> F
[4:15:52] <anar_bael> F
[4:15:53] <fearhurst> He BLEW
[4:15:55] <+bear_breaker20> @cawi @Jetsfantasy Yo those are pre cool mechanics thnx gais
[4:15:56] <%AncelDeLambert> bTOOOOO
[4:15:56] <%spiritofmojave> JUST DON'T WORRY
[4:15:58] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh well

[4:16:02] <%athuramn> it's okay!
[4:16:04] <%spiritofmojave> You're fine
[4:16:05] <$RubberFistFight> Pat is the angriest
[4:16:08] <%AncelDeLambert> eyyyy, just kill his past, it's all aight
[4:16:10] <%clausover> its in the thing
[4:16:11] <LokimenD> missed by this thus much
[4:16:12] <%ElenaManetta> Just always remember, you're getting paid to make mistakes, CAN GUNGEON SAY THE SAME
[4:16:12] <televisedrevolting> Fuck yeah, homing bullets.
[4:16:13] <TigerFlavoredCereal> You have 5 hearts? You'll be okay
[4:16:14] <Djinnazz> you got homing bullets, not a bad trade off.
[4:16:15] <%AncelDeLambert> ...wut
[4:16:17] <%Lambda_man> Rubbing salt in the wound
[4:16:21] <%AncelDeLambert> money why you hate us
[4:16:22] <artsugi1> that was a really good rulex kaard impression
[4:16:22] <fearhurst> Homing bullets, for the shot mister in you
[4:16:22] <%Lambda_man> twisting the knife
[4:16:23] <%ElenaManetta> PAT
[4:16:24] <%El_Desperad0> just leave the room Pat
[4:16:25] <%ElenaManetta> THE MONEY
[4:16:25] <%spiritofmojave> Five heart containers is solid still
[4:16:27] <Mr_Strut> Not allowed
[4:16:28] <%ElenaManetta> YOU FORGOT THE MONEY PAT
[4:16:29] <+HellfireComms> Pat c'mon man, don't get mad :/
[4:16:30] <anar_bael> You can leave the room and you autopick up the credits
[4:16:32] <%ElenaManetta> WHAT!!!!
[4:16:33] <shackbox> THE MONEY PAT
[4:16:35] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat you get it when you leave the room anyway
[4:16:38] <OkamiDude15> the money gets picked up when you leave the room
[4:16:40] <shackbox> YOU FERGOT DA MONEY
[4:16:42] <%ElenaManetta> WHAT REALLY?
[4:16:45] <%Lambda_man> @ElenaManetta money got stuck
[4:16:46] <+ABadIdea> he got the money, chill out guys
[4:16:48] <%El_Desperad0> The money is automatically picked up after leaving the room
[4:16:49] <VritraReiRei> @ElenaManetta you can't forget money. Money Autocollects
[4:16:50] <ssks123> you automatically get it when you leave the room
[4:16:53] <%TheGreatBamBe> It came to you lol
[4:16:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Demon skull his bestest and only friend
[4:16:55] <%ElenaManetta> Damn, on the Switch version, when money gets stuck on objects, the object explodes
[4:17:05] <person181> laser?
[4:17:07] <VritraReiRei> There's no reason to EVER pick up money guys because they just autocollect when you leave the room
[4:17:12] <+SPplayer> wow, its like raiden
[4:17:13] <fearhurst> Pat dont need no money, he need to beat bosses
[4:17:15] <%ElenaManetta> We mean the weird green money
[4:17:19] <321Continue> WHY DIDNT YOU BLANK
[4:17:19] <%ElenaManetta> The boss money
[4:17:23] <Zebylth> @elenamanetta you pick it up automatically when you leave
[4:17:24] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat for the new secret room, you need to sell a master round and any two other items
[4:17:25] <Lulu19> BRO COME ON
[4:17:31] <televisedrevolting> Homing Bullets are busted as hell depending on your guns.
[4:17:34] <VritraReiRei> @ElenaManetta i do mean that. it autocollects
[4:17:37] <LVDoomien> yeah the boss money went to him when he left the room I think Elena
[4:17:38] <DocChutney> @AngriestPat the credits teleport to you when you leave the room, you got them
[4:17:48] <mentalysedated> i think i may need to get this game, Pat has convinced me! this looks cool!
[4:17:50] <%ElenaManetta> It does?
[4:17:59] <%ElenaManetta> Why even bother having to walk over to it
[4:17:59] <fearhurst> Homing bullets and scattershot together are piss easy
[4:18:02] <%ElenaManetta> Why doesn't it just FLY to you then
[4:18:02] <televisedrevolting> Once got Homing Bullets with the Blackhole Gun and felt disgusting.
[4:18:04] <+HellfireComms> it is a fun game, but be prepared for a huge skill ceiling
[4:18:15] <%athuramn> Lol, fun update, Nintendo's error code now just says "problem occurred" and says 9pm
[4:18:21] <%claudesavegely> claudesavegely subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! hullo patrick, how is you?
[4:18:23] <+darkdagon769> oh boy
[4:18:27] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if pat gets an explosive weapon he'll pretty much be set with flak+homing
[4:18:39] <+darkdagon769> the smash shared content is now miiverse 2.0
[4:18:42] <AgoldTURD> Huh sling + flak bullets might be brojen
[4:18:50] <$RubberFistFight> @athuramn meanwhile select youtubers and streamers are having no trouble at all. The whole situation is absurd.
[4:18:53] <+XxBTExX> super tilted
[4:18:56] <person181> use the force pat
[4:18:58] <fearhurst> I beat the Advanced dragun first try because I had the black hold gun and singularity with an ice cube and the rad gun
[4:19:00] <+bear_breaker20> funny thing is, if you go to play either Smash or Gungeon both will need an update and Gungeons will work fine LUL
[4:19:01] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Paat! picnicMon
[4:19:04] <+SolverCODO> Don't face hopeless encounters head on like that. Run if you need to
[4:19:07] <Prism_Wing> Melee players sabotaging Ultimate Kappa
[4:19:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> didn't even think about that, does flak proc on bfg shots?
[4:19:28] <%ElenaManetta> If you didn't, you'd be dead by now
[4:19:37] <VritraReiRei> BLANK THE SHOP @AngriestPat
[4:19:44] <%Jetsfantasy> Okay, so I managed to get the update download working. Nothing on Eshop though, so Joker download is a no go. I'm just going to farm MGP tonight instead so I can pick up bitches in my Regalia mount
[4:19:45] <LVDoomien> yeah danger it was on the treadnought
[4:19:48] <%athuramn> I know zero only got around it by finding some guy at a gas station, getting his gf to go pick up that dudes switch, and locally update it when she brought it back
[4:19:57] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat there's a secret room in the shop, 100%
[4:19:59] <benjiFG> please roll
[4:20:14] <%ElenaManetta> I don't trust a guy with NO EYEBALL, VIRTUALREIREI
[4:20:18] <$RubberFistFight> @athuramn they're also nearly 3 hours after the end of their "scheduled maintenance" with no twitter updates and shit is still wrecked. This is worse than Blizzard's unscheduled maintenance habits.
[4:20:23] <+SolverCODO> Pats givin up the ghost
[4:20:41] <+skylerpilot> my Smash finally got through and started updating, could have gotten lucky though
[4:20:45] <%ElenaManetta> more like the huntsman is stuck with you ya bitch
[4:20:48] <%athuramn> oh they did a twitter update, but all they said was that they know there's a problem
[4:21:28] <fearhurst> damn no meatbun
[4:21:33] <$RubberFistFight> @athuramn that was nearly 3 hours ago though, is my point. Also now people are reporting that they've bought joker but he's not added to their roster, and the store isn't acknowledging the purchase, just prompting them to purchase him again.
[4:21:49] <+Cheekynandos689> shit like this is why is rarely ever get into anything day one
[4:21:52] <%ElenaManetta> Real tilt? What kind of youth terminology is that
[4:21:52] <+aishman> Holy shit, I just did a run with The Hunter
[4:21:54] <person181> lean into the tilt
[4:21:57] <+aishman> The dog only progged ONCE
[4:21:57] <%athuramn> lol, oh nintendo
[4:21:58] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat rubber16Tilt rubber16Tilt rubber16Tilt
[4:21:59] <alwayspronking> SMOrc brain
[4:22:01] <+bear_breaker20> Roguelikes tend to do that
[4:22:09] <Prism_Wing> Just think about Steiner to refresh your mind!
[4:22:20] <+XxBTExX> seems normal.... not stupid at all Pat
[4:22:21] <%AncelDeLambert> Ninty is dumb at times, and tech is that time EVERY TIME
[4:22:25] <%ElenaManetta> How could Nintendo not anticipate miiilllions of players downloooaddingg
[4:22:30] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat remember pat, were paying for this service now
[4:22:30] <%Jetsfantasy> Still, it happens all the time. Remember D3?
[4:22:31] <+HellfireComms> it's not just a character though
[4:22:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Ninty DOES NOT understand technology, it's so dumb
[4:22:33] <+XxBTExX> its about the numbers Pat
[4:22:34] <%ElenaManetta> Nintendo is also the bitch who purposely underproduces their consoles
[4:22:36] <+XxBTExX> servers cant handle the load
[4:22:37] <SomersaultJustice> that's because no one plays fighting games
[4:22:40] <%TheShal> Yeah but Smash isn't a fighting game
[4:22:41] <person181> we never saw him coming since he's not leaving
[4:22:44] <LixFury> anyother fighting game dosnt have smash numbers tho
[4:22:47] <Solidus_113> there was scheduled maintenance the exact same time the update dropped, so things are extra fucked
[4:22:53] <+HellfireComms> I'm not defending it since it's stupid and I want to play the thing I bought but this is comparing apples to oranges
[4:22:56] <$RubberFistFight> @ElenaManetta the problem is they simply don't care, they view it as an acceptable level of service as-is.
[4:22:57] <majindusto> I was alble to finally brute force getting Smash to update...So i got Joker! :)
[4:23:00] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Apparently some dumb fuck started server maintenance half an hour after the update went live
[4:23:03] <Paradocks23> "But smash isn't a fighting game, it's a collective party game. "
[4:23:06] <Nyckelus> Wait, what’s going on with Joker? I just got here.
[4:23:12] <%AncelDeLambert> is THAT what's happening?!!
[4:23:14] <LokimenD> I mean, are we forgetting the shitshow of SFV launch?
[4:23:14] <+XxBTExX> its basically the same shit that happens to games getting released and being unplayable online for like 2 or 3 days
[4:23:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god Ninty no
[4:23:18] <%Eclipse_knight_> do other fighting games even have the numbers to bring down the servers?
[4:23:18] <Monkeyweed21> why so tilt pat?
[4:23:19] <fearhurst> he lives in a societt
[4:23:21] <person181> to laugh at us
[4:23:23] <s_snowball> what if they scheduled the update for the same time as maintenance
[4:23:26] <%ElenaManetta> Because they don't have to care because they're not losing any sales from it. That's why competition is healthy! But you can't compete with Smash
[4:23:27] <Prism_Wing> shit happens prolly
[4:23:30] <Senselessvirus> @AngriestPat this has been a issue with Nintendo eshop before. Same thing happened when the pokemon bank first came out.
[4:23:31] <%ArcanumMBD> I think they didnt, i think maintenance is an excuse for the servers being down
[4:23:33] <%Jetsfantasy> Maintenence and Content teams probably didn't even talk to each other on release times
[4:23:47] <%AncelDeLambert> ooooh, shotty scythe, me like
[4:23:50] <mayorrev> BEST GUN
[4:23:50] <majindusto> Futaba Spirit is Inkling lol
[4:23:50] <$RubberFistFight> @Senselessvirus yeah this has been happening since the very first day Nintendo started doing stuff online, it's a fucking joke.
[4:23:53] <fearhurst> DONT .ISS
[4:23:53] <%athuramn> it's poor wording on their part, the maintenance was to address the update itself
[4:23:58] <+bear_breaker20> Sakurai is enjoying some sort of sip as he imagines our frustration at trying to play his game Kappa
[4:24:00] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat for the new secret room, you need to sell a master round and any two other items
[4:24:04] <%ElenaManetta> Remember when Valve used to run fucking maintenance checks on their Steam servers during TF2 8PM hours
[4:24:04] <%AncelDeLambert> he'll pay you, just give SUCC
[4:24:05] <%athuramn> the eshop side of things anyway
[4:24:07] <+ForteBlade> The servers aren't down though... Plenty of people have already downloaded the update
[4:24:09] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat open map, use D-pad to cycle items, then hold your weapon switch button on the highlighted item to drop (On switch its X)
[4:24:09] <Djinnazz> we told ou..
[4:24:09] <%ElenaManetta> What do you watn to drop?
[4:24:10] <hussdogrob> think it was more reaction maintenance then it was preplanned
[4:24:11] <%Chichen> down on dpad
[4:24:12] <%AncelDeLambert> check your settings, dude
[4:24:12] <%Chichen> and map
[4:24:13] <%clausover> down on d pad
[4:24:14] <%Niney_Who> Hold down on Dpad
[4:24:15] <Peakokdude> Off topic about the nintendo shitshow, didnt you pick up a table tech ability?
[4:24:15] <+cawi> hold down on dpad
[4:24:15] <artsugi1> HOLD F Kappa
[4:24:17] <fearhurst> If you hit the flak bullets you never lose ammo
[4:24:17] <%ElenaManetta> A gun or passive?
[4:24:17] <%hrudzie_1> Dont sell pheonix
[4:24:18] <+aishman> Well look at it this way, no other Nintendo release has ever crashed the servers which tells me of how popular joker is
[4:24:18] <%ThePuddingDead> map, select item with right/left, press y
[4:24:20] <Djinnazz> DOwn on D pad
[4:24:20] <Nyckelus> Ah, maintenance and updates happening at the same time. Gotcha.
[4:24:21] <mayorrev> bruh
[4:24:23] <%hrudzie_1> pheonix synergy
[4:24:23] <+zandar12> the spirit fight against the whole team is fucking rad
[4:24:26] <+aishman> Okay so to drop things you have to open the map
[4:24:27] <%ElenaManetta> To DROP A GUN, you hold DOWN ON THE D-PAD
[4:24:28] <%AncelDeLambert> the options exist, I don't know what to tell you
[4:24:30] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat passives you have to open up the map
[4:24:31] <+aishman> Oh there you go
[4:24:32] <%ElenaManetta> To DROP PASSIVE, you GO TO MAP
[4:24:36] <+Zxtole> You can also drop trash from destroyed chests
[4:24:38] <benjiFG> :)
[4:24:41] <+aishman> Also remember you can also drop items like JUNK
[4:24:43] <Monkeyweed21> master round
[4:24:50] <Lulu19> :)
[4:24:51] <Prism_Wing> so cute
[4:24:54] <%AncelDeLambert> don't drop junk, your junk pet needs it!
[4:24:56] <Djinnazz> have fun.
[4:25:00] <%mostundesired> mostundesired subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Fuck me I'm late. How's the gungeon?

[4:25:10] <lloyddboy> OK
[4:25:12] <+HellfireComms> HUH
[4:25:12] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[4:25:12] <%ElenaManetta> i'VE NEVER EVEN TRIED THIS
[4:25:14] <VritraReiRei> Wait, you didn't do the boss on that floor yet?
[4:25:14] <Nyckelus> Nee floor time!
[4:25:16] <Paperware> was that the glitch gremlin?
[4:25:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, taht's a mop, I thought he had a leash LUL
[4:25:18] <fearhurst> RNG Department
[4:25:22] <person181> the heck is this
[4:25:26] <majindusto> Just keep trying...Eventually you should get smash to update...Thats what I did
[4:25:26] <%ElenaManetta> i'M ABOUT TO BOOT UP GUNGEON RIGHT NOW

[4:25:29] <Nyckelus> This place is real cool!
[4:25:29] <%athuramn> wtf
[4:25:30] <$RubberFistFight> @ForteBlade that's great, plenty more people CAN'T do those things. Just because a handful are having no problem, doesn't mean that things are working now. In fact, that kind of behaviour is textbook symptomatic of a SEVERE load-balancing issue.
[4:25:32] <hussdogrob> you can also drop one round and two trash
[4:25:34] <%AncelDeLambert> how did he blow the grate?
[4:25:35] <3xgilly> lucky
[4:25:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> HEY ITS WORKING....And it crashed...Fuck

[4:25:56] <krymzen5> what floor do u get here from?
[4:25:57] <%windsoc> i still cant believe they got cam clarke to voice the boss of the RNG Dept.
