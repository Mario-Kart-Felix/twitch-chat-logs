[0:03:26] <%AncelDeLambert> it's crypt of the beatbox

[0:17:36] <$Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid500 My understanding is that each of DMCs principal characters embodie a type of cool/chic; Dante being the rocker, Nero the Punk, V the Goth, Trish the Biker, Vergil the weeb, ect. Seeing as Nero is partly an amalgum of Vergil's pesonality, If Dante were to have a daughter (with Lucia for example) would it not be natural for an amalgam of Dante and Lucia's personality to be the DMC equivalent of an insufferable millenial Hipster? PS Capcom please make a DMC0 game about Sparda.

[0:53:22] <Heissstt> @t_sasquatch keeping in rhythm dictates your coin multiplier
[0:53:22] <helpmeimafruit> So what Zelda song are you looking forward to the most in this style of gameplay? Is it Groose's theme?
[0:53:30] <%Jetsfantasy> @Hammerknife You have to, or suffer a score penalty. There's a character called the Bard that allows you to move when you want
