[0:29:08] <OkamiDude15> meth?
[0:29:08] <Force_Zer0> I wish to discuss various forms of crack
[0:29:09] <dekkitout> You can shoot up an 8-ball
[0:29:11] <redorbmerchant> you can rub cocaine anywhere
[0:29:11] <ToneBacas> TOS
[0:29:11] <%GabeSweetMan> You sure can despite how much you shouldn't do that.
[0:29:12] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> paige should cosplay trish and pat should do dante
[0:29:12] <+HoloToast> shoot a crack in your crack
[0:29:14] <Amesa3420> herion
[0:29:15] <london_flexing> You're thinking of heroine
[0:29:16] <redorbmerchant> apparently it works on the clitoris
[0:29:17] <derap41> its just liquid cocaine
[0:29:17] <+azure22900> Herione right?
[0:29:18] <$shurtal> Sherlock would inject cocaine with a needle
[0:29:20] <xbb1024> why isn't Paige on camera?
[0:29:21] <aiyobro> they did that in pulp fiction it doesn't work like that
[0:29:22] <%Captainahab_37> if you're gonna shoot up just go for heroine
[0:29:22] <mechslayer71> What did I walk into?
[0:29:23] <+Rewrench> crack for crack pipes
[0:29:24] <dukenux> @AngriestPat Crack is so passe... Frozen themed meth is all the rage now!

[0:29:34] <konami2010> Canadian accents are weird
[0:29:37] <$daveronald> the liquid form of crack is marijuana

[0:41:49] <+Dovakhin573> Devil bringer in R1, gun r2, and lock in l1 is the shit
[0:41:52] <T_Sasquatch> i put attack on r1 LUL
[0:41:55] <%Solidnick18> i tried but the trigger felt weird
[0:41:57] <Valdorick> We need to start a go fund me or something for a character action game that is just live action, but any time you're like, style beasting on enemies, and do like, double jump or whatever, a guy's hand with a stick on it picks up your character.
[0:41:59] <%Captainahab_37> I just play this game with a HOTaS setup
[0:42:09] <Valdorick> Just, all those cutscenes, but in gameplay. Make it happen, universe.
[0:42:10] <%Minovski> Hey you got the same controls as me now.
[0:42:10] <%kiiiirsten> Dong Dong Never Die
[0:42:10] <+Dovakhin573> And Ora oras
[0:42:11] <mr_miyagichu> I just hold and use air taunt to let myself let go of the button but that is probably a better idea
[0:42:12] <VJdarkworld> I put jump on the triggers
[0:42:19] <ChoculaUltra> you think we'll ever get a rebindable taunt?
[0:42:21] <+HoloToast> same
[0:42:21] <tmix1600> gun L2 much arm R2
[0:42:22] <T_Sasquatch> bitch hands
[0:42:22] <VergilHilts> I just fought Urizen as Dante. Good shit!
[0:42:24] <Tha_Mik> baby hands
[0:42:25] <%BioApple> holding shoulder buttons is ass on the xbone
[0:42:25] <squirtkitten> i use defualt controls
[0:42:28] <CaptainFrankincense> bumper jumper or bust
[0:42:31] <%starotter70> I put attack on R3 and gun on the dpad
[0:42:33] <%CerberusDriver> @ChoculaUltra just use steam big picture and rebind the taunt yourself
[0:42:37] <@SSaryn> @angriestpat Yo Pat btw, next stream, nexusmods got PS4 Prompts.
[0:42:37] <FeedbacK7777> If you have a buster devil breaker you can hold an enemy while buster'ing another @AngriestPat
[0:42:40] <konami2010> just get bigger thumbs nerd
[0:42:42] <%Solidnick18> Y angle
[0:42:43] <%Captainahab_37> why is Urizen such a dumb name
[0:42:45] <+Maids4lyfe> triangle...
[0:42:46] <spawnzie> I tekken fingers with Helter Skelter to throw punches in
[0:42:47] <%Captainahab_37> it sounds like piss
[0:42:52] <ChoculaUltra> @CerberusDriver ah that's smart! thanks!
[0:42:52] <redorbmerchant> urizen = your reason
[0:42:55] <Tha_Mik> cuz is a madeup name
[0:43:00] <konami2010> this is madness
[0:43:03] <conflict1914> classic setup
[0:43:04] <OkamiDude15> because urizen is your reason
[0:43:04] <%oAlec687> oAlec687 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat, I accidentally used redbull instead of water in my coffee this morning. About half way to work I realized that I forgot my car at home.
[0:43:09] <+Cafe_Spider> the real solution is mouse and keyboard
[0:43:10] <+HoloToast> DMC4 style, ish
[0:43:12] <%Mornaka> urizen=a bitch
[0:43:15] <T_Sasquatch> the biggest problem is muscle memory
[0:43:16] <%CerberusDriver> Urizen is also a character from William Blake so
[0:43:16] <squirtkitten> glad we went from no gameplay, to cutscene, to menu gameplay
[0:43:18] <%AkronymCLT> Hey same as my control scheme
[0:43:22] <Halospaz117> Wire's are cool
[0:43:23] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat Put jump on LS
[0:43:23] <conflict1914> wire snatch goes further though
[0:43:26] <Wizardism> does anyone else use the y/triangle for jump?
[0:43:26] <IminyourBase> patch why don't you just love snatch?
[0:43:28] <konami2010> like DmC?
[0:43:29] <%CerberusDriver> Big Snatch
[0:43:29] <conflict1914> i mean regular snatch
[0:43:31] <%BioApple> I had to map forward movement to LT and turning to RT because I needed the left analog stick for devil bringer apatLiz
[0:43:31] <derap41> so a square wire snatch
[0:43:31] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> the defaults are wrong melee is wrong
[0:43:31] <%violetheart> See I had a similar mix-up where I put attack on X/square, which meant I couldn't charge my breaker while attacking since the buttons were too far away.
[0:43:31] <%Captainahab_37> Well because it's from somewhere else doesn't make it not dumb
[0:43:32] <%EaeItsJohnKylar> EaeItsJohnKylar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:43:33] <Smart_ZaK1> Sometimes you just need vanilla snatch
[0:43:34] <%RageKingDomo> yea the default setting on this game are kinda ass lmao
[0:43:35] <Shining_Armor> Urizen is a reference to William Blake, the name isn't made up.
[0:43:38] <%AkronymCLT> @starotter70 you can't
[0:43:38] <VJdarkworld> Urizen = Your Reason (for changing controls)
[0:43:39] <%Hilleltaco> And now circle is your DMC4 button just like the old days
[0:43:40] <$valriot> Snatch is only mainly useful when you hold down Breaker
[0:43:40] <+stelfury> Square?
[0:43:41] <redorbmerchant> technically urizen has no name
[0:43:42] <+meatxsteam> @AngriestPat Would you consider gun on left trigger and devil breaker on right trigger? Just cause right trigger isn't too weird to spam
[0:43:42] <+Personified134> i prefer meat snatches to metal snatches
[0:43:45] <+countgaculatv> @AngriestPat What about Dante's buttom layout?
[0:43:49] <+epitaph_> is this SoS?
[0:43:53] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> GP-01 is da bessss
[0:43:56] <+Personified134> this is SOS yes
[0:43:58] <IminyourBase> i have many uses for snatch @valriot
[0:43:58] <OkamiDude15> yes this is sos
[0:44:04] <sir_nack> baller!
[0:44:11] <T_Sasquatch> @AngriestPat you can on hit the legs with regular buster
[0:44:13] <+Rinkimah> I forgot that Pat is like actually really good at DMC
[0:44:17] <+Personified134> this guy does his "get off me" move a LOT in SoS
[0:44:20] <T_Sasquatch> one hit *
[0:44:22] <PrinceOfEden> I always just triple jump or do a roulette in the air to stay on him.

[0:44:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[0:44:32] <%finnlad00> now apatHoldon
[0:44:32] <Ultimatefool> After going through DMD, SoS seems like enemies have such low health lol
[0:44:33] <%RageKingDomo> yoo whats this cool arm he had
[0:44:34] <The_Swedish_X> @AngriestPat Any reason you aren't using Buster on the leg pieces to break them instantly? Keeping your combo going?
[0:44:34] <squirtkitten> The Pat Train surely has nothing but breaks
[0:44:37] <%GingaNZ> apatHoldon apatHoldon
[0:44:39] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat You could say its URIZEN why you changed the controls
[0:44:41] <Valdorick> And he's streeeeeeeeeeeam… Stream Stalling.

[0:45:10] <+keksisblyat> Dmd is hard as shit for me holy shit, enemies being immune to hit stun is throwing me off
[0:45:13] <+TheoTTree> If you Buster those they break in 1 hit
[0:45:14] <conflict1914> How're you loving the triple jump btw?
[0:45:15] <%starotter70> DMC 2 is the most disappointing thing since my son

[0:49:59] <The_Swedish_X> I see they workshopped the joke items in later.
[0:50:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no looking cool is more better
[0:50:00] <blackdragonz> there was no pickle joke
[0:50:02] <$megamonmon123> so no royal guard pat?
[0:50:02] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Volta can go Donguri mode
[0:50:04] <%FrustratedAF> >can't style; >gets S
[0:50:05] <%CerberusDriver> @iforgottousername basically, that monster was just built out of demon metal and given sentience.
[0:50:05] <Wizardism> @OkamiDude15 Nut of Sparda mode
[0:50:05] <%Cavumentum> Judgement Nut
[0:50:08] <+ZippyPsycho> He said the J word

[0:50:09] <sileo_patronus> Complete lack of flexibility
[0:50:09] <ChoculaUltra> Sentinel (toy company) is coming out with DMC5 Nero and Dante figures. 1/6th scale too.
[0:50:10] <+insertcleverusernameheree> I may have to buy this
[0:50:10] <%BioApple> My strat with Dante is trying royalguard until I realize I suck ass with it and then switching to trickster forever

[0:50:17] <thetruthofyourbeing> as long as you win. Thats what matters
[0:50:17] <redorbmerchant> there are people who bought the fucking nero jacket for thousands fo dollaridoos
[0:50:18] <IminyourBase> royal guard is the most efficient
[0:50:19] <+Personified134> S ranks aren't very hard to get for the missions guys
[0:50:20] <dukenux> We see you can use Crazy Talk pat
[0:50:21] <VJdarkworld> Donguri uses claw grip on Both sides of the controller iirc from his dmc4 tutorial
[0:50:22] <eco419> bewbs
[0:50:23] <The_Swedish_X> I FINALLY got S on this mission on SoS an hour ago.
[0:50:23] <+Personified134> the game is pretty generous with them
[0:50:26] <%badchoice5> That bra is non-canon
[0:50:27] <Frostydough> @AngriestPat I thought i was a decent Dante until i got to Dante and found out i was dogshit :/ King Cerberus boss fight kicked my ass while i tried to style
[0:50:28] <derekwst3> Paige is doing ASMR, while Pat is apologizing, what is the world coming to
[0:50:28] <$megamonmon123> royal guard royal guard!

[0:50:36] <PrinceOfEden> Yeah, S ranks are much easier in this game since time isn't a factor.
[0:50:38] <%ElenaManetta> she's naked under all those clothes O_O
[0:50:41] <%Solidnick18> Lady PogChamp
[0:50:42] <%Divryne> Shall NEVER Surrender.
[0:50:43] <%BioApple> called out
[0:50:45] <derekwst3> she should be naked, im still disapointed
[0:50:46] <$valriot> Style in this is mostly just based on doing shit cool, and doing big damage all at once
[0:50:48] <abakkus> they just dropped the subtitles completely for a few lines there huh
[0:50:50] <%crimsonharvest> "it's super easy" says local obsessive

[0:51:12] <%ScreamingMeat> I think you get the Super Costumes for beating DMD
[0:51:12] <redorbmerchant> they are armored

[0:51:13] <$megamonmon123> yeah
[0:51:14] <derekwst3> most

[0:51:15] <gogoszy> YEPPERS!
[0:51:17] <Valdorick> Oh my god, I never noticed his tats are just on a flesh colored t-shirt.
[0:51:17] <troxcree> They do DT, don't know if they have no hitstun
[0:51:17] <spawnzie> They DT but they are not Immune to hitstun
[0:51:18] <Bhdown> DMD is a fucking slog
[0:51:20] <Hydrapissed> OMEGA POISE
[0:51:21] <ChoculaUltra> DT'd enemies one shot all of V's familiars too, so have fun with that.
[0:51:23] <%orangerainbow> @angriestpat FUCK GODDAM YES THEY DUE FUCKING HATED IT PAT
[0:51:23] <$valriot> They DT at like 60% sometimes
[0:51:23] <$megamonmon123> They also have TONNES of health
[0:51:23] <b1gboss007> they DT and kinda, you can break the hitsun easy
[0:51:24] <The_Swedish_X> I mean Mission 8, I forgot which came after Gilgamesh, Whoops @AngriestPat
[0:51:25] <Tetsu_TIW> they're not immune but much harder to stun
[0:51:26] <Redbee2000> except for nero his arm still kicks their ass for most
[0:51:27] <gloppie> DT but Comboable
[0:51:28] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat just beat Urizen in DmD prologue. Skip straight to Heaven or Hell. rooKek
[0:51:28] <mardenombres> getting an s rank is easy GETTING A FUCKING D, NOW THATS A FUCKING CHALLENGE
[0:51:29] <%CerberusDriver> theyre not immune to hitstun, but they DT
[0:51:31] <%FrustratedAF> WAIT WHAT she knew him?
[0:51:31] <The_Swedish_X> I'm dumb
[0:51:33] <Hydrapissed> yo paige would ya bang those gurls?
[0:51:34] <+timblenaut> LOL styrofoam!
[0:51:34] <BigBrandon907> I could’ve sworn I juggled enemies while they are in DT
[0:51:35] <$megamonmon123> DmD is NOT EASY
[0:51:35] <%Hilleltaco> V is tough in DMD
[0:51:38] <%finnlad00> styrofoam LUL
[0:51:38] <PrinceOfEden> DMD mode is not as hard as I thought, but it's still tough. They just get tanky as fuck.
[0:51:38] <+LeoStrahl> Oh god I love live action Vs fucking lame ass tattoos!
[0:51:38] <BlackMagicMarvus> If you drop combos, you lose ability to launch them when they hit the ground when DT'd
[0:51:42] <spawnzie> They do however do quarter of your health and take forever to kill
[0:51:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[0:51:44] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat they arent immune to it but it is harder to cause it
[0:51:46] <$megamonmon123> V's shadows die FAST
[0:51:46] <%MagickBurritoh> is Pat doing live action cutscenes the whole game?
[0:51:46] <derekwst3> we are just saying yes
[0:51:47] <eco419> no we re not
[0:51:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[0:51:50] <b1gboss007> they get very little superarmor
[0:51:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> maybe
[0:51:57] <$valriot> No you can still juggle
[0:51:57] <Kaede_Viz> DMD is the first time i've had to plan Neros breakers and order and pets dying on V matters.
[0:51:58] <%Gogogolem> These cutscenes are terrible i love them.
[0:51:58] <OkamiDude15> you can still juggle them
[0:51:59] <spawnzie> You can juggle enemies
[0:52:00] <$megamonmon123> you can still juggle
[0:52:03] <+countgaculatv> @AngriestPat do you change Dante's button layout?
[0:52:03] <redorbmerchant> they have higher poise but are juggleable
[0:52:03] <BigBrandon907> I’m pretty sure you can juggle
[0:52:04] <ShreddingPixels> you can still juggke em
[0:52:06] <ChoculaUltra> you can also still interrupt via parrying too.
[0:52:07] <%ScreamingMeat> DMD DMC3 was basically "Fuck you" mode
[0:52:07] <pwnhills> You can wire snatch most enemies just fine when they DT
[0:52:08] <%orangerainbow> @angriestpat after a couple minutes yes they start to glow and FUCKING RUIN YOUR FIGHT
[0:52:11] <$megamonmon123> they can still be juggled dont worry
[0:52:12] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat It's just harder to stagger them a bit, you can still juggle.
[0:52:14] <%Divryne> You can still juggle.
[0:52:17] <T_Sasquatch> chat just arguing LUL
[0:52:20] <%Solidnick18> here we go
[0:52:21] <%Hilleltaco> Juggling can still happen I'm pretty sure, just more armor
[0:52:22] <konami2010> yeah cuz Dante's at his best in the air

[0:52:36] <redorbmerchant> fausts snatching ability is crazy good
[0:52:36] <gloppie> You have to stagger them before you can launch, but it's still doable

[0:52:57] <OkamiDude15> not a fan of his EX either
[0:52:58] <T_Sasquatch> YOU ARE WRONG
[0:52:58] <mardenombres> When are you gonna do a d rank only run @AngriestPat ?
[0:53:00] <+l3sovikk> I don't like any EX colors.
[0:53:02] <televisedrevolt> It's a reference to GILVER
[0:53:02] <dukenux> He looks like a fucking Goth Legolas
[0:53:03] <%crimsonharvest> but why is he kylo ren
[0:53:03] <buffmurffy> EX is very St. patrick's day
[0:53:04] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I hate V's ex color. His default is way better
[0:53:05] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat V's EX color is a Gilver reference
[0:53:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> all the excolors are bad
[0:53:05] <PrinceOfEden> Why not?
[0:53:05] <kryedge> ALL the EX color are ugly AF
[0:53:06] <Evil_Emu147> Core values! ;)
[0:53:07] <+heroneiden> gucci nero
[0:53:08] <mechslayer71> Same. It’s not great
[0:53:08] <%finnlad00> OOF
[0:53:08] <+LeoStrahl> ok, I really kept misreading the juggling given the nature of that scene, and I'm kind of disappointed
[0:53:08] <iamnotaparrot> his EX id a reference to the manga
[0:53:08] <OkamiDude15> that sucks
[0:53:09] <mayorrev> oh nooooooo
[0:53:10] <%ScreamingMeat> I would have laughed my ass off if they kept the lense flare for the Live-Action cutscenes
[0:53:11] <aiyobro> i use his EX, it looks like ichigo kurasacki
[0:53:13] <%TombstoneTTromboners> rip
[0:53:14] <tacostarvedbeast> it feels like a bretryal when emo kids dont wear black, so makes sense
[0:53:14] <The_Swedish_X> Nero's EX is only Pre-order? That sucks.
[0:53:15] <lemon_lore> failed
[0:53:15] <wolvenelf> yeah unfortunately

[0:53:21] <RobertSledington> imagine not preording dmc5 NotLikeThis
[0:53:21] <iforgottousername> Nero Blanco
[0:53:21] <%MagickBurritoh> that's not cool
[0:53:22] <Megapikman132> give it time.
[0:53:24] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I kinda like Nero's white outfit
[0:53:24] <mechslayer71> You didn’t pre order?
[0:53:24] <mercado94> fuck preorders

[0:53:29] <Kriss1827> Kriss1827 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:53:29] <$valriot> His EX is Credo colours BibleThump BibleThump
[0:53:30] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Preorder only is FeelsBadMan
[0:53:31] <%GarbageNirvana> They'll probably be DLC eventually
[0:53:32] <ChoculaUltra> Nero's DT with his EX color looks like Credo's DT from 4. P neat imo.
[0:53:33] <LegendaryDorkKnight> pizza time
[0:53:34] <eco419> white is better...oh wait
[0:53:34] <$MightyMaxT> Black Jacket Lady rules
[0:53:34] <HairballCT> Vexrilg
[0:53:35] <Redbee2000> Vergil and Lady are the best ex colours
[0:53:36] <dildozerfred> White Power Nero?! Exposed
[0:53:37] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat They'll maybe add it later.
[0:53:39] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat i might know of a friendly phantom that can get you Cracker Nero.
[0:53:39] <The_Swedish_X> I prefer almost all the normal colours to the EX colours when it comes to Player Characters.
[0:53:40] <troxcree> Oh I coulda sworn that white Nero was just a deluxe edition thing but I gess I did preorder it like a day beforehand.
[0:53:42] <Prism_Wing> Cooler? Like Freiza's brother?
[0:53:43] <%Cavumentum> Just use the Fallout New Vegas Character Overhaul, that'll give you white Nero
[0:53:44] <%Nope80808> That what you get for getting it 2 weeks early loser!
[0:53:45] <iforgottousername> How do you unlock npc ex colors? I preordered
[0:53:45] <+DeRedBaron> so how do you get EX V? cus i looked it up but it wasn't really working for me
[0:53:45] <b1gboss007> arent the extra colors unlocks for not preorders ?
[0:53:47] <OkamiDude15> maybe in the next patch they'll ad it as an unlockable? probably not tho
[0:53:49] <conflict1914> i didn't preorder it but i got it anyway, somebody didn't pick up their deluxe copy so i bought it instead
[0:53:49] <thetruthofyourbeing> and i didnt pre-order
[0:53:51] <TakesGuts> they'll sell the ex colors down the line for sure
[0:53:51] <%lloyddboy> FUCK YEAH
[0:53:56] <T_Sasquatch> Neros ex color is CREDO
[0:53:57] <iamnotaparrot> I think beating dmd gives you classic Vergil
[0:54:01] <$megamonmon123> so has anyone beat dnd yet? i jusy finished mission 11 and it was TOUGH. im actually using gold orbs now
[0:54:02] <PrinceOfEden> I recently learned that you can fully co op this mission. Like if you guys both make it to the stage within the same moment, it's full blown co op.
[0:54:03] <%MrBorisMakarov> FUCK YEAH
[0:54:04] <$valriot> FUCK THESE GUYS
[0:54:05] <%FrustratedAF> that's fuckin sick

[0:54:15] <sileo_patronus> Not preorder only, deluxe edition only. I bought deluxe edition off PSN AFTER the release date
[0:54:19] <%alexandrecau> riot cowarding out
[0:54:22] <Tetsu_TIW> BALLER BrokeBack
[0:54:24] <$MightyMaxT> They sold the bonus costumes for Lady & Trish in DMC4SE, right?
[0:54:26] <%ScreamingMeat> They are Basically the Lizard from Spider-Man but naked
[0:54:26] <troxcree> @megamonmon123 Does it count if you killed Urizen in the prologue?
[0:54:34] <%violetheart> The alternate announcer voices are great.
[0:54:35] <Shooterboy23> @megamonmon123 yeah i beat it. Its not as hard as it was in DMC3 and 4 I tell you hwat.
[0:54:37] <ChoculaUltra> Riot coolly withdraws?
[0:54:37] <PrinceOfEden> @sileo_patronus Nah, pre-order only. I don't have the deluxe edition, but I have the outfits.
[0:54:37] <%Solidnick18> super sexy sexy
[0:54:39] <Jane_Lo> who is the announcer here?
[0:54:39] <$MightyMaxT> They were pre-orders iirc
[0:54:40] <%violetheart> Kind of sad Nero and V share Nico though.
[0:54:41] <%finnlad00> STYLIN
[0:54:47] <%chocolatez3r0> @iamnotaparrot no thats heaven or hell
[0:54:47] <Redbee2000> Nico

[0:54:52] <conflict1914> i just learnt that earlier today too PrinceOfEden I was playing as Nero and just sort of stumbled across it near the escalators
[0:54:54] <spawnzie> Pat aren't you taunting all the tme with V?
[0:54:54] <$megamonmon123> @troxcree no but impressive
[0:54:55] <%violetheart> Dante has a unique one. Feel like they should have given V something unique.
[0:54:55] <+HoloToast> SourPls

[0:55:13] <ChoculaUltra> Call me fuckin' weird - but I thought the Stylish Announcer was going to be Donte's VA from DmC.
[0:55:13] <%violetheart> Griffon would have been a *great* announcer.
[0:55:15] <Halospaz117> SIMP
[0:55:15] <rararasputino> AKA easy
[0:55:16] <ivansonic08> How did you get the alternate Stype anouncer
[0:55:16] <tacostarvedbeast> super easy sexy
[0:55:19] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat In case you’re wondering, Buster Arm does 1.5x the regular Buster’s damage, and Break Age Buster does like 3x DT Buster’s damage
[0:55:20] <Hydrapissed> that bird is paige
[0:55:23] <$MightyMaxT> (Grand)Son of Sparda
[0:55:23] <ShreddingPixels> he's hard on dmd
[0:55:26] <%Solidnick18> jeez griffon
[0:55:28] <$megamonmon123> @shooterboy23 yeah i was never as motivated to do dmd in 3 and 4
[0:55:29] <%Hilleltaco> @T_Sasquatch He gets a lot less so when you start needing to keep your summons alive. They die in like 1 hit on DMD
[0:55:31] <blaine_themono> put son of sparda in the title of the stream lol
[0:55:31] <jyrecko> Gryphon is a potty mouth
[0:55:34] <todcomod> hey pat do you also wish there were more dante levels?
[0:55:35] <b1gboss007> DMD V us super crazy, one hit and one of your health bars is gone
[0:55:40] <PrinceOfEden> @conflict1914 Yeah, it never happened because I always paused. Pausing immediately drops the co op. But since we made it to the escalators at the same time, we even fought that first sequence together.
[0:55:40] <%JaydenSai> Bob Ross! CoolStoryBob
[0:55:41] <Jane_Lo> Bob Ross CoolStoryBob

[0:55:48] <VritraReiRei> CoolStoryBob
[0:55:50] <+LeoStrahl> Can we have Paige be Pats style announcer? While she's on stream and all
[0:55:51] <+DeRedBaron> seeing how i hear how much harder it gets for V on more difficulties cus some enemies one shot the demons makes me think there might be somethign lacking
[0:55:55] <Valdorick> Vergil is a nerd confirmed. Poems, Chess references, classical music, A FUCKING KATANA!? Fuck'n Weeb Nerd.

[0:56:37] <Jane_Lo> Nico as announcer sounds so good FeelsGoodMan
[0:56:37] <%brickwall35> How do you spell V?

[0:57:04] <Smart_ZaK1> Sick styles
[0:57:11] <silvcrest> No hype allowed guys
[0:57:14] <spawnzie> For some reason Nico's style announcements give me a Viewtiful Joe vibe
[0:57:15] <grayjammer> Stylish Little Accidents
[0:57:16] <%SrG00SE> @AngriestPat whos getting those 3 million orbs, eh?
[0:57:17] <%CerberusDriver> Griffon loves fighting
[0:57:18] <The_Swedish_X> Those mushrooms are such an odd inclusion.
[0:57:19] <$megamonmon123> so what are heaven and hell and hell and hell like?
[0:57:20] <Hydrapissed> so on pc V is totes gana get a strider skin
[0:57:22] <PrinceOfEden> Fun Fact: V's AOE Cane move kills everything in Heaven or Hell mode.
[0:57:23] <silvcrest> Patstreams are the anti-hype
[0:57:26] <T_Sasquatch> his song is literally split into two
[0:57:27] <dukenux> Metro: Exodus too a weird turn
[0:57:30] <ChoculaUltra> Total power move on Capcom to get Gilbert Godfrey to voice Griffon Kappa
[0:57:31] <+HoloToast> oh damn
[0:57:35] <%violetheart> Rad.
[0:57:36] <spawnzie> oh yeah
[0:57:37] <OkamiDude15> woopsMB your right
[0:57:37] <R3c0n31> Really?
[0:57:37] <joniroquai> How many V missions are there total?
[0:57:38] <PrinceOfEden> @megamonmon123 Heaven or Hell: Everyone including you dies in one hit.
[0:57:40] <%Solidnick18> Huh
[0:57:42] <Aydarkzero> symbolism PogChamp
[0:57:44] <conflict1914> oh fuck, thats super detailed
[0:57:45] <+HoloToast> sbfpSetIn
[0:57:45] <VJdarkworld> Ohhhh yeah
[0:57:45] <blaine_themono> it was the first thing i noticed :o
[0:57:46] <+Shadicara> Yeah it's his yamato pimp slap
[0:57:46] <$megamonmon123> thats true
[0:57:46] <+DeRedBaron> also he is legit just tricking to checkmate
[0:57:49] <Shooterboy23> he also says BLAST
[0:57:50] <PrinceOfEden> @megamonmon123 Hell and Hell: You still die in one hit, but enemies don't give a FUCK.
[0:57:51] <derekwst3> did woolie finish the game yet?
[0:57:51] <Hydrapissed> Strider v aww yeh
[0:57:52] <Jane_Lo> i think the most thign that baffles me about V, he wears a freaking corset under his coat
[0:57:53] <The_Swedish_X> There are 10 Nero, so V has less than that.
[0:57:53] <talisign> The symbolism of Gilbert Godfrey
[0:57:56] <eco419> wait v is vergil D:
[0:57:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> I just tuned in and got an ad for Metal Wol- Nope, just the division.
[0:58:01] <%Solidnick18> this game is great
[0:58:03] <SiraX666> 4
[0:58:04] <%FrustratedAF> are you SUGGESTING that V could be related to VIRGIL somehow? crazy talk. pure crazy talk apatCrazyhead
[0:58:08] <Bailey__gaming> is spooky ghost Paige there tonight?
[0:58:09] <%Solidnick18> so many things
[0:58:13] <ArthurDoyleRPG> So they reused animations, cheap Kappa
[0:58:14] <redorbmerchant> does pat have the 3 million orb taunts unlocked yet?
[0:58:14] <+Shadicara> No v is vergin
[0:58:20] <Hydrapissed> Starring bob ross
[0:58:23] <$megamonmon123> @princeofeden oh... well fuck me then, i may try it dmd. my hands need to recover from the pain of being stylish
[0:58:26] <%FrustratedAF> @Bailey__gaming paige is extra lupus'd but she's here
[0:58:27] <+verelme> Urizen fucks, V is a virgin
[0:58:27] <+HoloToast> god I hate Promotion LUL
[0:58:32] <OkamiDude15> @Bailey__gaming she is currently watching on the couch while being sick/dying
[0:58:35] <$megamonmon123> its somehow easier and harder to style in dmd
[0:58:36] <derekwst3> this is his second playthrough there are no spoilers
[0:58:41] <gogoszy> BEEAM
[0:58:41] <blaine_themono> i hate getting on top of nightmare, it feels way too slow
[0:58:47] <tri3dgE027> I always like how hyped Griffon always is
[0:58:48] <ChoculaUltra> Nightmare should've been able to pick up Shadow and use him as some weebass shadow weapon
[0:58:51] <spawnzie> I honestly don't like mounting Nightmare
[0:58:53] <Valdorick> V can't be a Virgin, he's half of one.
[0:58:56] <+LeoStrahl> Can Paige be Pats style rank announcer? I think she'd be good at keeping him humble
[0:58:57] <grayjammer> "Your death shall end your nightmare" BibleThump
[0:58:58] <+HoloToast> lemme finish that demo---- aaaaaand I'm on Nightmare
[0:59:09] <%Mornaka> I thought V was going to be like a Nelo Angelo chunk of somekind
[0:59:09] <derekwst3> I still use both griffon and shadow combos at the same time
[0:59:11] <PrinceOfEden> @megamonmon123 DMD mode wasn't as bad as I as I thought it would be. You'll be fine. (I had 35+ gold orbs when I started and still had 30+ when I beat it.)
[0:59:12] <%violetheart> @AngriestPat Did you know some enemies have extended kill animations if you mash the cane button? Earns you more style too.
[0:59:13] <OkamiDude15> THAT WOULD BE COOL
[0:59:15] <Bailey__gaming> @okamidude15 oh no! Big Bio affliction! sending her some energy
[0:59:18] <thetruthofyourbeing> I legitimately thought V was a reincarnated mundus.
[0:59:21] <%BioApple> fastball special gryphon
[0:59:21] <Captain_Aham> fastball special
[0:59:22] <%Solidnick18> bob ross very good
[0:59:23] <+HoloToast> join Bob PogChamp you're live
[0:59:23] <IminyourBase> nightmare should speedball special shadow
[0:59:24] <Hydrapissed> shadow kunai WIT chain
[0:59:26] <The_Swedish_X> Nightmare mounting is nice for the I frames, but I do prefer to just let him do him.
[0:59:26] <derekwst3> im proud bob ross
[0:59:29] <yukichocomilk> KappaRoss
[0:59:29] <PrinceOfEden> But yeah, I'm gonna take my time with Hell and Hell mode.

[0:59:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And the bird should totally become a lightning crown for Nightmare LUL
[0:59:44] <ChoculaUltra> imagine being a demon trying to kill some lanky jerk and some asshole throws a panther at you
[0:59:46] <%IDTheftVictim> Nah something big
[0:59:48] <%NopeBadguy> I wish v got an extended mechanic like Nero or Dante where he turns into Nelo Angelo @angriestpat
[0:59:51] <blue6sub6remnant6> @thetruthofyourbeing Me too. I feel very silly, having learned the actual story.
[0:59:55] <troxcree> God I hope Bloody Palace has co-op.
[0:59:57] <derekwst3> we don't
[0:59:57] <Shooterboy23> DO IT COWARD
[0:59:58] <%IDTheftVictim> Like a great axe or bardiche
[0:59:58] <konami2010> do it coward
[0:59:58] <$megamonmon123> did you see that video of someone parrying with V's cane?
[1:00:00] <shaneok64> Nightmare turns them into sword and shield PogChamp
[1:00:00] <%lloyddboy> DO IT COWARD
[1:00:01] <%Solidnick18> idk
[1:00:01] <Megapikman132> I'd like to see DmD
[1:00:01] <b1gboss007> DO DMD
[1:00:02] <%enkaisu> DO IT
[1:00:02] <spawnzie> I love V's line when killing nobodies "You like to dance? The floor is yours"
[1:00:04] <Rexenexus> D O I T
[1:00:04] <%madhattergay> @AngriestPat how do you feel about nero saying the fuck word?
[1:00:05] <konami2010> DO IT
[1:00:07] <+verelme> do it
[1:00:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You should at least try DMD
[1:00:07] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Id love to see you go through DMD
[1:00:10] <%Plague_Nurse> DMD is hardest it's every been since DMC1
[1:00:11] <pwnhills> DO IT
[1:00:12] <Bailey__gaming> is anyone else excited for PaX East?
[1:00:12] <sounata> you gotta
[1:00:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> on stream I mean
[1:00:12] <Artista_AF> swing Shadow like a pair of nunchucks
[1:00:13] <%primax104> any rumors on more characters?
[1:00:13] <PrinceOfEden> I would LOVE to see you struggle through hell and hell. @AngriestPat
[1:00:14] <%Solidnick18> i hope
[1:00:18] <blaine_themono> id rather see dmd then sos then
[1:00:18] <PrinceOfEden> I WOULD LOVE IT
[1:00:19] <person181> the real question is. 'more anime?'
[1:00:23] <derekwst3> bloody palace yes, but no on hell v hell
[1:00:23] <konami2010> people datamined the game and confirmed BP has co-op
[1:00:24] <%TombstoneTTromboners> i can't wait to style with my friends
[1:00:25] <reonome> LET NERO SAY FUCK
[1:00:25] <$NocturneNovember> Nero's earned it
[1:00:28] <thelonechris> Let Nero say fuck
[1:00:29] <baggysmells> Pat are you doing sekiro on stream?
[1:00:32] <eco419> D:
[1:00:36] <Valdorick> Nero saying fuck is bad? Dude has a sex toy arm!
[1:00:36] <PrinceOfEden> Nero said fuck several times in DMC4, not sure why it's a big deal
[1:00:36] <%CerberusDriver> Nero isnt Dante
[1:00:37] <spawnzie> Because it fits with his style
[1:00:37] <+critfumble_> I super hope we get ladies night
[1:00:37] <troxcree> It's not like he didn't flip Dante off in 4.
[1:00:38] <%Solidnick18> dante says shit so
[1:00:41] <%FrustratedAF> @baggysmells yes
[1:00:42] <derekwst3> They are old enough to say FUCK
[1:00:43] <%alexandrecau> nero is a mouthy child
[1:00:46] <rararasputino> It makes sense for Nero's personality. He also flipped people off in DMC 4
[1:00:47] <%Mornaka> indeed
[1:00:51] <%IDTheftVictim> Just as long as he hates smoking
[1:00:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Fuck is vital to punk
[1:00:52] <spawnzie> He's a rowdy boi
[1:00:53] <R3c0n31> V would be so good to go with Virgil. AOE team of EDGE
[1:00:56] <%CerberusDriver> also Nero isn't Dante
[1:00:56] <+DeRedBaron> most dante says is Douche bag and bitch slap
[1:00:57] <%ElenaManetta> what brand of cool are you?
[1:00:57] <mayorrev> FUCK YOU DAAAAAAAAAD
[1:00:57] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@thetruthofyourbeing) (warning)
[1:00:57] <$NocturneNovember> Nero got to develop a personality before he started saying fuck. That's what makes it okay.
[1:00:58] <%alexandrecau> that's hip hop
[1:00:58] <Smart_ZaK1> Let Vergil say fuck
[1:00:59] <%GarbageNirvana> And yet he doesn't smoke
[1:00:59] <CSeriesJTYPE> nero also said bullshit in dmc4 so
[1:00:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> not around his waifu tho
[1:01:00] <Shooterboy23> Dante doesn't say Fuck at all in this :)
[1:01:02] <rekinom> Would you say Punk Fucks?
[1:01:04] <T_Sasquatch> im so they are using this coop to test out for a new dragons dogma
[1:01:06] <baggysmells> @frustratedaf Thank you
[1:01:06] <+Donutjulio> I will literally double dip the game to play with friends if co op is in
[1:01:07] <rosemon5001> more like an punk ass bitch
[1:01:08] <PrinceOfEden> @rararasputino This. He literally screams "FUCK YOU" when bustering Mr. Monocle.
[1:01:08] <%lloyddboy> Griffon is VERY punk
[1:01:09] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> wtf was that
[1:01:10] <%BigNerdSam> @angriestpat What kind of cool is Vergil?
[1:01:13] <gsoto83> But the goths love to say fuck as well
[1:01:14] <%ScreamingMeat> What is Vergil then? Classy Cool?
[1:01:16] <Hydrapissed> Puck funks

[1:01:21] <The_Swedish_X> @BigNerdSam Prep
[1:01:23] <shaneok64> Vergil is a Prep
[1:01:24] <dukenux> Punk is just two letter away from "Fuck" Kappa
[1:01:24] <+HoloToast> sbfpYeyeye
[1:01:24] <derekwst3> get good
[1:01:28] <%madhattergay> theory: dante doesnt fuck
[1:01:28] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Vergil's cool is the same cool as V
[1:01:29] <spawnzie> Make sure you air taunt when you're on S or higher
[1:01:29] <%Minovski> No Pat that was a joke for me.
[1:01:29] <Artista_AF> KappaPride
[1:01:30] <$megamonmon123> vergil is preppy cool @screamingmeat
[1:01:30] <berserkbat99> also 1 fuck is allowed for the pg 13 rating
[1:01:30] <pectusumbra> Vergil is anime cool and everyone knows it
[1:01:31] <gsoto83> How can this be????
[1:01:31] <VJdarkworld> Nero says fuck and loves his GF
[1:01:32] <bingobangoboingobongo> vergil is "Prep"
[1:01:33] <CrypticMochi> Asshole cool?
[1:01:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[1:01:35] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat DON'T PAUSE. You can co op the entirety of the rest of the mission.

[1:01:48] <R3c0n31> OH SHIT
[1:01:48] <alrobot2014> holy shit that's cool
[1:01:49] <blue6sub6remnant6> Vergil was mastering the blade while you were busy eating pizza.
[1:01:49] <PrinceOfEden> @violetheart Run into the other player in this section
[1:01:49] <tri3dgE027> Wait what? This can happen?
[1:01:51] <Jane_Lo> yes, you can
[1:01:53] <reiju_22> :O
[1:01:53] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Nero has to get all his swears out while he's away from Kyrie
[1:01:53] <+wizard_of_diamonds> PogChamp

[1:01:58] <+HoloToast> time to judge his exceed taunts Kappa
[1:02:00] <Jane_Lo> and you can't even skip a cutscene, if that's a real player
[1:02:00] <redorbmerchant> all missions with select a character are coop
[1:02:00] <ChoculaUltra> weird, this happens to me all the time when I play as Nero but never run into Nero when I play as V.
[1:02:01] <%FrustratedAF> that's not nero that's bob ross Kappa
[1:02:02] <+Rinkimah> That's actually him playing by the way, the symbol above his name means this is happening live right now
[1:02:02] <derekwst3> as long as you time it right yes
[1:02:02] <Tha_Mik> If you go fast I guess
[1:02:04] <spawnzie> Yup if you sync up you can go all the way to the angelos
[1:02:04] <+Ondartyr> I love how Nero DTing for the first time that isn't in a cutscene is by him flipping his father the bird.
[1:02:05] <Lord_of_all_Edges> It's a stream sniper
[1:02:05] <%Solidnick18> holy shit
[1:02:07] <R3c0n31> Ive also never seen this
[1:02:08] <%Hilleltaco> Co-op bois
[1:02:09] <%primax104> you probably have to be quick
[1:02:09] <%Ganerumo> this can also happen on chapter 13, all three guys can hang out in the same room
[1:02:09] <dukenux> I can't believe Adam Driver and Bob Ross fight demons together
[1:02:11] <+Donutjulio> I think the co op is poorly implemented if you played this much and never noticed
[1:02:11] <mak0t0yukii> True Co op experience hashAww
[1:02:12] <Shooterboy23> FOLLOW HIM PAT
[1:02:13] <PrinceOfEden> This could always happen, but 2 different characters/players tend to move at different paces.
[1:02:13] <+Maids4lyfe> I've always played this mission as Nero
[1:02:13] <Tetsu_TIW> They always just fade away when I reach this room
[1:02:13] <SweetestEggplant> @AngriestPat did you pay $60 to constantly get called dismal?
[1:02:13] <VJdarkworld> @princeofeden WTF i didnt know that pausing drops the “coop” thing
[1:02:14] <mr_miyagichu> That’s wild
[1:02:16] <T_Sasquatch> why are you guys surprised LUL
[1:02:19] <OkamiDude15> nero's strentght comes from how much he loves kyrie also his 1/4 demon heritage
[1:02:21] <blaine_themono> hes bookin it
[1:02:21] <tri3dgE027> Also seems like that dude IS a live person due to the Symbol at top their name
[1:02:22] <rosemon5001> lol bob ross using his god powers
[1:02:23] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat I feel like Nero's big FUCK YOU was super earned, story wise
[1:02:23] <Valdorick> If this is what stream sniping gets us, THEN I WON'T COMPLAIN
[1:02:25] <+jorgamund> Nero's too cool to stick around
[1:02:25] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Happy Little Clouds
[1:02:28] <Valdorick> Stream Sniping done right!
[1:02:29] <$megamonmon123> i mean it makes sense, you go through the same part

[1:02:39] <PrinceOfEden> @VJdarkworld Yeah, it tries to re-matchmake you, but in certain sections, it just ends it.
[1:02:40] <%lloyddboy> NOW IT BEGINS
[1:02:41] <lozscat> Does Nero look like Cody Rhodes ?
[1:02:41] <pwnhills> @AngriestPat Pat, why don't you empower Shadow and Griffon with your DT meter
[1:02:42] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:02:43] <PrinceOfEden> Like here.
[1:02:43] <%alexandrecau> you paid 80
[1:02:43] <Shooterboy23> Father son bonding at its best
[1:02:47] <dukenux> AFAIK that was just a salty forum thread
[1:02:47] <spawnzie> Also I'm pretty sure it's not just ghost cuz i once had to wait for the other player to skip a cutscene
[1:02:49] <derekwst3> you are showing bob ross how to paint
[1:02:49] <+Personified134> this is actually dope as shit i haven't gotten this before

[1:03:51] <OkamiDude15> SO HERE I AM!
[1:03:51] <gsoto83> In bob ross we trust
[1:03:52] <Jane_Lo> @yukichocomilk simple, you just don't need to pause the game and you will stay with your partner till the end of level
[1:03:53] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ScatterCatt) (warning)
[1:03:54] <+HoloToast> and that's why Nero doesn't say anything there Kappa

[1:03:59] <+stelfury> TAUNT HIM
[1:03:59] <lionmanguy> !uptime
[1:03:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 4m.
[1:04:00] <Tracazoid> It's why Bloody Palace co-op would be cool, a multi-floor gauntlet of 2 or 3 player styling. Kreygasm
[1:04:01] <hotrax> taunt him
[1:04:03] <dukenux> PRETENDING IM A SUBHUMAN
[1:04:10] <R3c0n31> WAIT IS THIS COOP? he was radomaly doing jumping, so it isnt only data
[1:04:14] <mechslayer71> This game with proper queue up co-op would be stellar
[1:04:14] <ChoculaUltra> Nero's style does nothing to appease the red orb lords.
[1:04:15] <konami2010> people datamined DMC5 and co-cop bloody palace IS CONFIRMED
[1:04:17] <bingobangoboingobongo> can we turn co-op off? DansGame
[1:04:19] <%IDTheftVictim> ah he doesn't help with tree :(
[1:04:21] <$valriot> Ive grown to hate V doing DMD and HAH, especially when Griffon and Shadow ALSO die in one hit...
[1:04:21] <%primax104> any chance of more playable characters?
[1:04:21] <%FrustratedAF> bloody palace will be coop AND harder apatDab
[1:04:24] <%MagickBurritoh> so is it play data or what?
[1:04:25] <Megapikman132> This is live co-op, yeah
[1:04:25] <rararasputino> He fucked his up
[1:04:25] <dukenux> Those are dmg, not stle
[1:04:26] <+HoloToast> *cough* Nero fucked his one up
[1:04:27] <tri3dgE027> @VJdarkworld Ghost Data does not have that symbol at the top of their name, and typically has a Red Skull like icon beside the name. Live people have the Blue icon
[1:04:28] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> The little wifi icon above his name means it's real co-op
[1:04:28] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> This is real coop but it's super hard to set up properly
[1:04:28] <derekwst3> im just hopin the ladies get a shot, I felt they were here for nothing but to look good
[1:04:29] <eco419> LUL
[1:04:30] <PrinceOfEden> @R3c0n31 Next to the name if you see the wi-fi antenna symbol thing, it's a real time player.
[1:04:32] <OkamiDude15> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:04:33] <$megamonmon123> by the end of the game is nero the legendary dead weight?
[1:04:35] <+Rinkimah> @R3c0n31 The symbol above the name to the left means it's a live persoin
[1:04:35] <Jane_Lo> @R3c0n31 it is coop, i interacted with some people on mission 13
[1:04:35] <%CerberusDriver> Your co op parter has his own orbs, that way you dont steal other peoples Rorbs

[1:07:28] <%Solidnick18> jump
[1:07:29] <+verelme> gotta save that DT
[1:07:30] <Valdorick> 10/10
[1:07:31] <PrinceOfEden> SwiftRage
[1:07:35] <joniroquai> Holy shit, that's cool
[1:07:36] <%MagickBurritoh> GOTTA SAVE THAT DT
[1:07:39] <%CerberusDriver> Gotta save that DT
[1:07:39] <%Cavumentum> But what if I need it later
[1:07:42] <OkamiDude15> but guys what if he needed that DT for later
[1:07:47] <The_Swedish_X> Gotta save DT for... nothing?
[1:07:49] <sakuraa98> STOP
[1:07:50] <%weissguard> !uptime
[1:07:50] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 7m.
[1:07:51] <+mcjimbo12> @violetheart controlling griffin is so annoying, i want to backpedal while shooting but it always makes me do the shitty charge aoe circle
[1:07:53] <+HoloToast> we might need that DT for Mister X
[1:07:54] <rararasputino> Jesus christ Pat
[1:07:54] <%Hilleltaco> @mcjimbo12 On DMD, DT has been helping me if only for "I need my summons to stop being dead right now" considering they die so fast
[1:08:01] <+LeoStrahl> I really wonder how much they got paid for doing these cut scenes. Regardless, I know I'd probably do it for free
[1:08:02] <thetruthofyourbeing> what if tho??
[1:08:04] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> ...but you can build DT whenever you want with book
[1:08:07] <greaphy> !uptime
[1:08:07] <%ScreamingMeat> You have an Infinite D.T Book Pat
[1:08:08] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Pat you build DT SO FAST AS V
[1:08:09] <%Duke_of_HI> DT is a temporary buff tho
[1:08:10] <alrobot2014> i wish i could refute that, but that's what i did in dmc 4 dmd with dt
[1:08:10] <%MagickBurritoh> can't or won't?
[1:08:11] <$megamonmon123> oh pat will have a bad time in dmd
[1:08:12] <IminyourBase> what if you did stop tho?
[1:08:12] <+Shadicara> Seriously live action Japanese devil may cry
[1:08:14] <rararasputino> Cna't stop, won't stop, please stop
[1:08:14] <derekwst3> I used to play on a box too
[1:08:14] <%Mornaka> HAHAHA
[1:08:16] <SweetestEggplant> nice house
[1:08:16] <$Yakobro> YEYEYE
[1:08:16] <DaGodKira> if u need it later, then u better start hitting them now
[1:08:17] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[1:08:18] <dukenux> LUL
[1:08:27] <%BioApple> but it's good tho
[1:08:27] <blaine_themono> really?
[1:08:28] <dukenux> The Sparda residence
[1:08:29] <+mcjimbo12> oh shit really
[1:08:29] <The_Swedish_X> But options.
[1:08:31] <%violetheart> ...wait, really?
[1:08:31] <eco419> oh ty
[1:08:33] <Halospaz117> WHAT
[1:08:33] <televisedrevolt> Buh wuh
[1:08:34] <redorbmerchant> but the orb attack is strong
[1:08:34] <Valdorick> Why'd they need a guy under there!?
[1:08:35] <+kraajkase> WHAT
[1:08:35] <R3c0n31> But the orb attack is good lol
[1:08:36] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat Devil Breakers are consumables
[1:08:37] <kouhi12> Don't worry @AngriestPat I hoard just like you and it's amazing
[1:08:38] <derekwst3> that house looks like mine
[1:08:39] <Tetsu_TIW> it's so strong though
[1:08:39] <+verelme> that's some serious tech
[1:08:40] <thetruthofyourbeing> good to know
[1:08:41] <powerprotoman> gotta save my resources i might need them later he says in the post true ending credits
[1:08:41] <Oqzar> or fix your inputs
[1:08:42] <ChoculaUltra> yep, always remove moves that get in the way of your style. No shame in it.
[1:08:43] <+omegasis> but I wanna do the juggle tho
[1:08:44] <Caidezes> You can turn pretty much every move off.
[1:08:44] <%FrustratedAF> you can turn skills off??? expectation exceeded
[1:08:46] <+Jeikujeiku> Yeah most good action games let you disable abilties now adays
[1:08:46] <+HoloToast> god fuck I want to do that with Idling on Cavaliere
[1:08:46] <%weissguard> Goos to see that you're doing okay. @angriestpat apatWhat
[1:08:47] <+Rathalos2006> WHAT. I was just thinking that one move is my only problem with V.
[1:08:47] <%IDTheftVictim> You know props on these guys for actually acting in the middle of a bunch of cardboard. Like they are really trying to sell it.
[1:08:47] <+Donutjulio> The orb would actually be good if it wasnt on V
[1:08:48] <OkamiDude15> chat you can tuen off moves in shop
[1:08:53] <Mr_Loboto> @AngriestPat I'm overly utility focused it's a problem. I actively stop myself from using my most effective ability. It's a problem. Wait.....
[1:08:53] <%superc37> YOU CAN TURN MOVES OFF??
[1:08:54] <NeonBleu> wtf is that clock for?
[1:08:55] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> id do that, but I feel like i'll need o for DMD
[1:08:57] <PrinceOfEden> Yeah you can enable/disable any ability. How are you guys just learning this?!
[1:08:57] <derekwst3> turning them off is easy
[1:09:00] <joniroquai> Wait...is that a new feature in 5?
[1:09:00] <%ScreamingMeat> But then the Orb is useful for making enemies back off while taunting
[1:09:00] <PrinceOfEden> NotLikeThis
[1:09:02] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat if you turn off that attack in the skill list does it effect his boss fight
[1:09:03] <rararasputino> Live action cutscnes are a lot less interesting without the goofy bullshit
[1:09:03] <T_Sasquatch> 14:50 🤔
[1:09:04] <%BioApple> I keep accidentally using it too but I'd rather just learn to not move when I don't have to, because I keep doing stingers as the other characters for the same reason
[1:09:10] <%MagickBurritoh> walk into that wall
[1:09:10] <hotrax> But what if i like the orb attack but have problens using the other attacks?
[1:09:11] <+keksisblyat> But the skill is good I don’t wanna remove it aaaaaaaaagh
[1:09:14] <shaneok64> That is the closest to fatherly affection nero will ever get
[1:09:15] <+chexmixisbest> just start holding the button before you move backwards lol
[1:09:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nice cutscene :)
[1:09:22] <OkamiDude15> @joniroquai yup
[1:09:26] <+TheoTTree> 13k points PogChamp
[1:09:29] <ShopperKung> @AngriestPat Pat when you play as Dante when fight Urizen i see some people said that you can find another Kalina Ann in Urizen boss fight room
[1:09:30] <%FrustratedAF> delicious style points Kreygasm
[1:09:31] <+LeoStrahl> I didn't notice he was wearing a long sleeve shirt! That's even lamer! I love live action V!
[1:09:31] <The_Swedish_X> Now its time for the first of many difficult S ranks.
[1:09:32] <joniroquai> Nice
[1:09:38] <+mcjimbo12> @chexmixisbest no because holding the button makes him charge his aoe laser, i want to be able to tap it
[1:09:45] <dukenux> CoolStoryBob
[1:09:51] <%JaydenSai> I miss Bob Ross already
[1:09:53] <+Jeikujeiku> it was justa couple clicks for me

[1:10:08] <thetruthofyourbeing> holy fuck
[1:10:09] <hotrax> LUL
[1:10:09] <+Donutjulio> The chick who plays nico in these is cute af
[1:10:15] <The_Swedish_X> I bet they kicked the figure over a couple of times.
[1:10:19] <derekwst3> Im going to bob ross' stream
[1:10:22] <redorbmerchant> hmm that sucked
[1:10:24] <CSeriesJTYPE> it spents one bar of DT per press

[1:10:40] <LeiaSkynoober> Are the live action cutscenes the Japanese vas?
[1:10:41] <Halospaz117> Remove all of your moves
[1:10:44] <eco419> ...ok
[1:10:45] <Hydrapissed> all of em
[1:10:47] <%Solidnick18> yep i
[1:10:47] <%FrustratedAF> PogChamp expectation exceeded
[1:10:49] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Tech that we didn't need but am glad to have
[1:10:51] <redorbmerchant> these are just dev cutscenes
[1:10:55] <ChoculaUltra> where's Elmo? Fight Club?
[1:10:56] <$MightyMaxT> Seems like Nico wasn't really developed until later in development
[1:10:57] <thetruthofyourbeing> do a no move yun
[1:10:58] <+kraajkase> fuck I feel super stupid now..
[1:11:00] <redorbmerchant> they act out the cutscenes before developing
[1:11:05] <%FrustratedAF> elmo is away being famous
[1:11:06] <%maskedriderhero> I think the live action one implies Nico was grossed out, so confirms Nico probably isn't into Nero
[1:11:07] <thetruthofyourbeing> run
[1:11:08] <iamnotaparrot> Pat, do the mission 13 faust grind and get every single upgrade in about an hour.
[1:11:09] <dukenux> Real gamers beat DMC with ALL moves removed
[1:11:14] <+mcjimbo12> oh side note: how the fuck do you do dance macabre when you have DSD equipped? @AngriestPat
[1:11:17] <The_Swedish_X> First fight arena here in SoS sure is a surprise.
[1:11:20] <dukenux> Summon Shelmo
[1:11:23] <Jane_Lo> oh this level, my bayonetta 2 nightmare fuel
[1:11:23] <redorbmerchant> i cant wait for the live action dr faust scene
[1:11:25] <PrinceOfEden> @mcjimbo12 Back forward B
[1:11:27] <SomersaultJustice> Pat or Alive
[1:11:35] <troxcree> @mcjimbo12 It's back then forward and style.
[1:11:37] <JayPastaForce> The cutscenes make me think of Dong Dong Never Dies
[1:11:39] <$valriot> Okay yeah fuck V in HAH, thats shits cancer
[1:11:41] <+mcjimbo12> @PrinceOfEden but doesn't B just make you summon swords?
[1:11:46] <devanmuse> I know there's an acheivement for beating Urizen in the prologue, but what about beating Urizen phase two in this mission?
[1:11:47] <PrinceOfEden> No, back forward
[1:11:49] <TheWorstChance> you can hold them?
[1:11:51] <Kyonclone7> cloud kitty, floaty and fluffy and a cat DxCat
[1:11:54] <+Donutjulio> Oh my god I didnt know you could hold the enemies in 5
[1:11:59] <Smart_ZaK1> Lol they don't stand a chance
[1:12:00] <redorbmerchant> devanmuse its the same achievement
[1:12:08] <%primax104> SASSY
[1:12:08] <+countgaculatv> No jump canceling gun attacks?
[1:12:08] <Shooterboy23> Learn to jump cancel
[1:12:09] <thetruthofyourbeing> sassy!
[1:12:09] <OkamiDude15> @TheWorstChance yup. nero could to in 4 as well
[1:12:09] <derekwst3> how would you feel if they brought Credo back but as a bloody palace only character?
[1:12:09] <%Hilleltaco> @mcjimbo12 Not if you do the motion. It's like the input for Nero's shuffle
[1:12:09] <LazyLudens> @mcjimbo12 back forward and then spam circle
[1:12:10] <+DeRedBaron> i do like how Nero does still have the moves he gained in 4 when he got his devil trigger
[1:12:11] <$valriot> Pat about to get fucked up
[1:12:13] <raincoatponch> whoa ok how do you do that grab
[1:12:15] <+DrPoxx> Is there an all enemies are vergil mod yet?
[1:12:20] <raincoatponch> is that just for those guys?
[1:12:23] <+DeRedBaron> like they were legit in his soul this whole time
[1:12:26] <OkamiDude15> @raincoatponch when you buster someone you hold the button
[1:12:28] <SweetestEggplant> i hate the flaming piss bats
[1:12:28] <+Personified134> if you want grabs you need either a buster arm or to finish the game
[1:12:29] <The_Swedish_X> I think Urisen is actually impossible in this mission, because he regens his shield super fast.
[1:12:32] <+mcjimbo12> Alright thanks folks. I thought since Rave and Prop got different inputs that Dance would too
[1:12:32] <mechslayer71> Fury incoming PogChamp
[1:12:34] <+Personified134> or hold i guess?
[1:12:37] <+Personified134> i didn't know that was a thing
[1:12:40] <Mr_Strut> I'm tempted to get this game so that Trish can call me dismal constantly.
[1:12:40] <Barehair> Anyone remember when bloody palace drops
[1:12:44] <%BioApple> knock knock it's knuckle
[1:12:45] <ChoculaUltra> April 1st.
[1:12:51] <$megamonmon123> @the_swedish_x you can beat him
[1:12:52] <raincoatponch> oh i meant that 3 gunshots kill
[1:12:53] <%RoninRorinth> RoninRorinth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! how are you doing pat? also what was your favorite moment in the game?
[1:12:54] <+Personified134> idk what knuckle means
[1:12:59] <+mcjimbo12> showdown is so rad in this gfame
[1:13:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Funky_Honkey) (warning)
[1:13:02] <raincoatponch> not the hold specifically
[1:13:03] <$lolslowking> Knuckles best application is cancelling knockback for sure
[1:13:05] <sir_nack> damn nice parry
[1:13:07] <FeedbacK7777> @AngriestPat you can mash knuckle mid buster moves just like shots.
[1:13:07] <derekwst3> The Magaize he finds in this mission, do you think that its originally Dantes?

[1:13:25] <PrinceOfEden> @Personified134 After you unlock DT as Nero, you can press the buster button after a swing to "Knuckle" like you can exceed after a swing
[1:13:26] <conflict1914> I love that you can just punch them in the face mid combo
[1:13:27] <+countgaculatv> Fuck Fury dude
[1:13:27] <MetaSla> god I hate these speedy things
[1:13:28] <ChoculaUltra> I love how you can punch people with the Devil Arm during certain moves

[1:14:03] <Embraceshadow> that's rad
[1:14:04] <Kyonclone7> CLIP!?
[1:14:05] <The_Swedish_X> They knew how cool Fury was the moment they conceived him.
[1:14:06] <Sloavon> what are those pop ups?
[1:14:07] <Hellarussian> Neros edgy form is cool as shit
[1:14:08] <eco419> hot
[1:14:08] <+Sipulisoturi> I JUST LOOKED AWAY, and missed it
[1:14:08] <raincoatponch> good lord nero
[1:14:09] <conflict1914> We need to go into the void and see that clearer @AngriestPat
[1:14:09] <+Shadicara> Some Bleach bullshit right there
[1:14:10] <Shooterboy23> that was ok i guess
[1:14:10] <%Cavumentum> UNF
[1:14:11] <bingobangoboingobongo> dammit what I miss?
[1:14:13] <%Hilleltaco> Those enemies are a pain but the grabs on them are cool
[1:14:15] <The_Swedish_X> Fury is just better Blitz
[1:14:16] <jyrecko> BIG OOF
[1:14:17] <+kraajkase> that one is from a trailer
[1:14:20] <+Risingxiv> Does DT Nero look like Onimusha?
[1:14:20] <$megamonmon123> btw i really dont know how tp deal with those speed freaks
[1:14:21] <Lazyallaround> Do it again I wasnt Looking DX
[1:14:21] <gogoszy> Fury buster.
[1:14:21] <$thewisewolf> someone clip that?
[1:14:22] <+jorgamund> look at this HELLEVATOR
[1:14:24] <+Rathalos2006> Rathalos2006 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:14:25] <Manwad> I couldn't even comprehend what happened
[1:14:29] <%CerberusDriver> Fury is the Dreamrunner from DmC but done much better
[1:14:30] <ChoculaUltra> Fury is Blitz without the epilepsy warning which is great.
[1:14:39] <$megamonmon123> usually sin dt IMMEDIATELY when those things come out
[1:14:42] <PrinceOfEden> @Personified134 But yeah, the knuckle can have it's uses. Extra damage and helps with knockback. Like if you streak and knuckle, the enemy won't go flying, they'll stay nearby.
[1:14:46] <+mcjimbo12> @megamonmon123 you have to parry them then 1 shot them with a nero DT combo->grab or a real impact
[1:14:47] <%averyoddjew> he looks like his "stand" from 4
[1:14:47] <+Maids4lyfe> onimusha confirmed?
[1:14:49] <%ScreamingMeat> Little bit
[1:14:55] <redorbmerchant> why isnt pat using the air taunt charge ever?
[1:14:57] <Sloavon> DT Nero reminds me of Ichigo in his hollow form. His voice helps.
[1:14:57] <Tha_Mik> a big onimusha
[1:15:02] <Jeemukun> DT nero kinda reminds me of devilman
[1:15:02] <+Personified134> the streak and knuckle thing might be the hottest tip i've recieved yet holy fuck
[1:15:02] <LoudBog> is this SOS or DMD?
[1:15:03] <OkamiDude15> @PrinceOfEden wait really? woopsMB
[1:15:03] <TakesGuts> onimusha + devilman imo
[1:15:06] <+geary28> my first thought was that DT Nero looks like Devilman
[1:15:06] <The_Swedish_X> SoS
[1:15:08] <$megamonmon123> @mcjimbo12 i see i see...
[1:15:09] <OkamiDude15> @LoudBog SOS
[1:15:09] <blue6sub6remnant6> I mean, DT Nero looks like another character voiced by Johnny Bosch...
[1:15:10] <ChoculaUltra> I lowkey miss Frosts tho, the floaty ice dudes in this are cool but I like my ice demons chonky
[1:15:11] <%alexandrecau> dt nero looks like every shonene demon hero, from sasuke stupid hand wing to ichigo
[1:15:12] <PrinceOfEden> Fun Fact about the Sin Devil Trigger: It's kind of an homage to the scrapped "Perfect DT" from DMC4.
[1:15:14] <derekwst3> we need a onimusha/ devil may cry game
[1:15:14] <%MelancholicMasochist> you mean vaste lorde ichigo lol
[1:15:21] <+Personified134> i've just been working on my dante this whole time but damn guess i have to get back in the nero lab
[1:15:22] <%AllyBeeBoo> how are you doing exceed so well?
[1:15:24] <Hellarussian> hwip
[1:15:25] <+Personified134> rawhide is raw
[1:15:25] <+mcjimbo12> @megamonmon123 i know that's not very useful, i can't it either LUL
[1:15:27] <PrinceOfEden> @OkamiDude15 Yeah, try it. It's the main use of knuckle for me.
[1:15:31] <fairore> @melancholicmasochist lol totally
[1:15:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> DansGame
[1:15:35] <Valdorick> Okay, so, Dante is a gay cowboy, V is Sieg from Chaos Legion, and Nero is Onimushia.
[1:15:37] <%CerberusDriver> Fun fact about Sin Devil trigger, that might be another mis-translation
[1:15:38] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> V O R E D O O R
[1:15:40] <Artista_AF> can't wait to see DT Nero in Live Action LUL
[1:15:44] <DaGodKira> what if u got stuck in those vein thingys
[1:15:46] <$megamonmon123> @mcjimbo12 sigh, better get with the timing
[1:15:47] <+Personified134> @AllyBeeBoo degenerate amounts of practice
[1:15:48] <+jorgamund> spoiler: there isn't a shower
[1:15:49] <%CerberusDriver> apparently its Shin Devil Trigger, like Shin Akuma
[1:15:50] <todcomod> he's had plenty of practice
[1:15:53] <+HotBloodedHero> just expanded
[1:15:53] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> how do you feel about the lack of super annoying platforming challenges from past games?
[1:15:54] <+Doroco> is this the first level?
[1:15:55] <Nekros4442> So if u were going to do co-op bloody palace with Woolie which characters would u 2 be using?
[1:15:57] <+mcjimbo12> Rawhide reminds me of Overture, just a super solid DPS increase into your combos
[1:15:58] <mechslayer71> Is it? I found it much easier
[1:15:58] <jeecay> Ride'em in RAWHIDE!
[1:15:59] <+Risingxiv> isnt dawn of dreams a onimusha dmc? I played it like one
[1:16:02] <+Dovakhin573> Shin makes more sense
[1:16:02] <%zafooru> is Nico doing the style annoucements??
[1:16:03] <ChoculaUltra> @DaGodKira would it be considered a blood clot or a traffic jam?
[1:16:03] <OkamiDude15> @PrinceOfEden ive used knuckle a shit ton too but i guess i never noticed since im usually hardlining and pulling enemies toward me woopsKek
[1:16:05] <FenixSeraph> MY POWER!!!
[1:16:06] <hotrax> POWER
[1:16:10] <Sloavon> MY POWER
[1:16:10] <Hyperionyht> it's even easier this time
[1:16:10] <$megamonmon123> so its because pat was literally training offscreen for 10 years
[1:16:13] <person181> but what if you need it
[1:16:13] <LoudBog> Live action DT Nero is amazing I cannot wait for that on Stream LUL
[1:16:17] <redorbmerchant> finally

[1:16:22] <%Solidnick18> oh shit
[1:16:22] <%RoninRorinth> do you think nero got his devil tigger easier than his dad because of D cells?
[1:16:22] <+Personified134> TAKE THAT WOOLIE
[1:16:23] <%ScreamingMeat> Remember when you gave Woolie 20 bucks for Max Acting off the air taunt?
[1:16:23] <todcomod> is knuckle devil bringer?
[1:16:24] <redorbmerchant> air taunt is the shlt
[1:16:24] <Sloavon> Nero sounds depraved

[1:17:18] <GrandmasterBFunk> what difficulty is he playing?
[1:17:19] <%Solidnick18> yeah that happened to me too @AngriestPat
[1:17:20] <%Hilleltaco> Because it didn't break, you just fell off it. Happened to me too, no glitch
[1:17:23] <+Dovakhin573> you know whats nuts using the fuck out of knuckle while charging showdown
[1:17:23] <Dragovus> Them demons got them FAT ASSES!

[1:17:31] <$cureneckbeard> reparations
[1:17:31] <%FrostMass22> Vergil did nothing wrong
[1:17:32] <Tetsu_TIW> It didn't glitch, the charge shot knockback just pushed him off the side
[1:17:32] <+HoloToast> I bet you wish you had a motorcycle right now
[1:17:33] <derekwst3> I did it on my play through as well, on both
[1:17:36] <PrinceOfEden> You can also throw the enemies through the same gap
[1:17:39] <+mcjimbo12> Honestly the pop-off I'm waiting for most from Woolie is learning that post-game nero just has all his DMC4 shit
[1:17:40] <Sloavon> everyone saying "glitch" must be some casual gamer
[1:17:41] <PrinceOfEden> But ain't nobody got time for that
[1:17:45] <Smart_ZaK1> Vergil just wanted a quiet life
[1:17:54] <Smart_ZaK1> with MoTHer

[1:18:24] <The_Swedish_X> *ora ora
[1:18:25] <OkamiDude15> you can knuckle while bustering an enemy

[1:18:30] <+keksisblyat> I’m farming orbs so I appreciate having da stream in the background @angriestpat
[1:18:30] <+Maids4lyfe> you were beating up the goat with the lizard
[1:18:30] <+HoloToast> even as a gross Yu-Gi-Oh man Nero still revs his sword as a taunt LUL

[1:18:46] <dukenux> What kind of POWER is this?
[1:18:46] <+countgaculatv> SoS difficulty
[1:18:47] <Tetsu_TIW> and buster arm's breakage does stupid damage, while DT buster doesn't do nearly as much

[1:18:50] <%Solidnick18> apatBig stylin
[1:18:50] <+DeRedBaron> the fact that you can't aim with ragtime (cus hard lock makes it use wire snatch) legit makes it a lot less useful
[1:18:50] <jeecay> what difficulty?
[1:18:51] <+Maids4lyfe> sos mode
[1:18:52] <ChoculaUltra> he grabbed BOTH you fuckin asshole.

[1:18:55] <smellybingus> IT'S GETTING BIGGER
[1:18:55] <Sloavon> Vergil killed millions of people and Nero and Dante just responded with "cool, man :)"
[1:18:55] <grayjammer> You're not powerful enough for these potions, traveller
[1:18:56] <$megamonmon123> @advoccat son of sparda

[1:18:58] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Can you mash Summon Sword and Buster Knuckle at the same time?
[1:19:02] <mar_krow> I like with every bit of you buster it throws out a punch instead of a grab
[1:19:02] <Shooterboy23> SoS= Should have been Normal mode
[1:19:03] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat should people buy this game
[1:19:03] <Dragovus> Pat is becoming the Dark Phoenix

[1:19:46] <PrinceOfEden> @countgaculatv The same way you can exceed after and attack, you can press the buster button to punch with the buster. Hence "knuckle."
[1:19:47] <%ScreamingMeat> Bust Devilbringer has infinite ammo and can be used in tandem with other breakers

[1:21:06] <PrinceOfEden> DOUBLE OOF
[1:21:07] <redorbmerchant> showdown!
[1:21:10] <+HoloToast> WHY WON'T YOU DIE
[1:21:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat if you do it right you can jump cancel moves so quickly that no actual sword attack comes out, but if you knuckle at the same time they won't be cancelled and you can beat on enemies while looking hilariously like you're climbing an invisible ladder
[1:21:10] <sir_nack> guess who's gettin their ass kicked
[1:21:11] <+luketrapwalker> DODGE PLS
[1:21:13] <%VanaSkiller> NOT ALLOWED TO BE COOL

[1:21:14] <+verelme> what a showdown
[1:21:15] <conflict1914> wait the enemy shittalks you back?
[1:21:15] <$megamonmon123> that was a woolie moment right there
[1:21:19] <DynemaUmbra> @AngriestPat have you tried using knuckle and helter skelter together, yo basically get an ora ora with how many times it hits
[1:21:22] <jeecay> nice photo though. face in the dirt
[1:21:22] <+Shadicara> Showdown more like Shown up Kappa

[1:21:31] <+HotBloodedHero> I didn't realise the Angelos speak.
[1:21:33] <bonzosan> scudo should have super dt
[1:21:34] <The_Swedish_X> My favorite bit about the Angelos taunt is that Nero will kick them in the through at do a pump at the end if you don't cancel out of it.
[1:21:35] <ToneBacas> can you buy that super expensive taunt yet Pat?
[1:21:40] <The_Swedish_X> *throw
[1:21:41] <sosuke5> Woah, looking cool Pat

[1:21:50] <%FrustratedAF> pat has yet to purchase any EX Taunts.
[1:21:52] <%primax104> do the demons DT at this difficulty?
[1:21:56] <conflict1914> goop time
[1:21:57] <The_Swedish_X> Man that was a lot of bad autocorrect.
[1:21:59] <DynemaUmbra> @AngriestPat you basically just mash both and it just works
[1:22:00] <PrinceOfEden> I'm about 500K away from 3 million.
[1:22:04] <tadahito3> @tadahito3 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:22:04] <FeedbacK7777> You can just mash knuckle. both on helter skelter and during buster animations
[1:22:06] <%SrG00SE> @AngriestPat which are you planning on getting?
[1:22:09] <PrinceOfEden> Have every other ability
[1:22:10] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat what's with the photos?
[1:22:19] <%FrustratedAF> oh hey a godess statue.. that's... useless at this point....
[1:22:22] <%SrG00SE> yeah its easily th ebest
[1:22:22] <redorbmerchant> just use dr faust in gunslinger mode and you get about 50000 rorbs every fight
[1:22:27] <The_Swedish_X> I had to get Dante's first so I could S rank mission 10
[1:22:30] <jeecay> I think I just completed this level on sos
[1:22:30] <conflict1914> RIP
[1:22:31] <+VariantX7> do the demons get new attacks in higher difficulty levels?
[1:22:32] <sir_nack> V's is the best no one can convince me otherwise
[1:22:35] <The_Swedish_X> at least on DH
[1:22:35] <+Papafleish> is this son of sparda?
[1:22:38] <PrinceOfEden> @mayorrev After you beat the game, nico snaps a picture of each enemy for her reports.
[1:22:39] <%MagickBurritoh> is there a name for the 2 frame dance?
[1:22:43] <PrinceOfEden> You can also retake them
[1:22:45] <Hellarussian> YEYEYE
[1:22:46] <revenant4444> @angriestpat I love how awesome they made Nero in this one, like i was iffy on him way back when 4 came out, but he's actually my favorite in 5, which I never expected going into it lol
[1:22:47] <mayorrev> ohh ok
[1:22:47] <yakuzaspirit> pat will never see this message goddamnit
[1:22:47] <+mcjimbo12> I didn't realise exceeded high roller actually hit behind you as well that's so rad this game is so good @AngriestPat

[1:22:53] <mayorrev> neat*

[1:22:54] <Dragovus> Them demons got them FAT ASSES!
[1:22:54] <$D4C_Trice> I'd buy V's taunt first

[1:24:26] <OkamiDude15> @Hilleltaco pretty sure. saw donguri put up a vid on twitter of him styling on vergil and that was the first ive seen of it
[1:24:26] <+mcjimbo12> man my exceed timing is so bad on red queen combo C
[1:24:28] <kryedge> Pat, Favorite buster at the moment?
[1:24:29] <MonstarGrrrl> power
[1:24:30] <redorbmerchant> god i hate this keyboard
[1:24:31] <Nina96> POWAH!!!
[1:24:31] <conflict1914> @AngriestPat So who's your favourite to play as now that pretty much all the mechanics are on offer?
[1:24:39] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @cerberusdriver Because for 3 million their super underwhelming
[1:24:41] <%MoraMiarty> can't believe the lust for power is hereditary
[1:24:43] <%CerberusDriver> @lloyddboy the games been in dev since 2015, they were prolly busy with more important things
[1:24:44] <weontheultralightbeam> Am I wrong for thinking the rawhide devil breaker sucks?
[1:24:46] <PrinceOfEden> Fury
[1:24:46] <+Shadicara> Just give Nero a Sin DT now
[1:24:47] <+Austinck> In the library I saw a journal about how that sparda put his powers in three swords, so does that mean there are two orther sparadas weapons out their
[1:24:49] <PrinceOfEden> It's so fucking sick
[1:24:52] <sir_nack> the sound effect when nero slams an enemy into the ground is so fucking satisfying
[1:24:53] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat You should get V's taunt 1st.
[1:24:53] <redorbmerchant> 3 million can be gotten in like 2 hours using dr faust
[1:24:55] <Zombrocom> Hell Judeca's have a sick buster
[1:24:57] <gunzerkingdunce> I still say Vergil's
[1:24:58] <+DeRedBaron> I've always found the big taunts to be a Red Orb sink in teh way that after the other games, you have nothing else to buy after you buy the move list so your orbs just sit there
[1:25:01] <kryedge> Oh yeah, it´s fucking wild. Super hard to land also
[1:25:04] <T_Sasquatch> Nero
[1:25:05] <$megamonmon123> yeah that was pretty solid
[1:25:08] <T_Sasquatch> always
[1:25:15] <%Rayorin> Rayorin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 3 months in, got to the stream just in time to see you styled on by a gb of empusas. You're the best, i'm excited for the next 3 months.
[1:25:23] <+countgaculatv> I'd say Nero, he's the more technically sound while not being too much.
[1:25:25] <derekwst3> dante is top, v is middle, nero is low for me
[1:25:28] <%CJett92> I'd do Nero and Dante at the same time, too
[1:25:28] <%Remery_> lewd
[1:25:33] <%CJett92> I mean ya
[1:25:34] <%ElenaManetta> DT & Knuckles 3
[1:25:36] <PrinceOfEden> Nero > Dante > V for me
[1:25:37] <OkamiDude15> yeah
[1:25:39] <dukenux> "Nero and Dante at the same time, and V just a little bit below" Kappa
[1:25:40] <%FrustratedAF> QUAD S?!?!
[1:25:42] <kryedge> Will Vergil be playable? He has a shit ton of moves already,
[1:25:42] <Tucker0603> Nero is just the fucking coolest to me
[1:25:44] <+countgaculatv> Dante has too much going for him for me to style with consistently
[1:25:45] <mechslayer71> Exactly. V is pretty static
[1:25:46] <%hntronium> QUADRUPLE ASS
[1:25:46] <PrinceOfEden> But I'll probably run V in bloody palace first
[1:25:46] <+peri_d0t> @countgaculatv yeah I find dante way too oberwhelming
[1:25:46] <$valriot> Also V fuckin sucks in DMD and HAH, hes really infuriating to play as in those
[1:25:49] <conflict1914> Imagine if V replaced his cane with the Yamato and could do basic judgement cuts and teleportations
[1:25:50] <NeonBleu> V knows what he did
[1:25:52] <$lolslowking> Yeah V not changing at all is my only disappointment here
[1:25:52] <sir_nack> wait what is quadruple s?
[1:25:55] <Artista_AF> & Knuckles Kappa
[1:25:56] <%alexandrecau> v should get summon urizen as a bonus
[1:25:56] <+mcjimbo12> @kryedge Yes, if you do some mod fuckery he's playable
[1:25:57] <%cherubs_anonymous> Wait till we get Vergil tho
[1:25:58] <T_Sasquatch> if v had more depth id be happy
[1:25:59] <%FrustratedAF> @hntronium two buttholes Kreygasm
[1:26:03] <Divantae> The motorcycle weapon is so fun for me
[1:26:07] <KillerGibbs> should have turned him into Vergil
[1:26:07] <derekwst3> Virgil will be in bloody palace, unsure if he will get any story missions
[1:26:09] <redorbmerchant> V could use more summons
[1:26:09] <$lolslowking> @valriot V against any boss on DMD has been so annoying
[1:26:10] <$megamonmon123> makes sense since V is a nobody in this game Kappa
[1:26:11] <+countgaculatv> Also Devil Sword Dante's move set feels meh compared to bread and butter Rebellion/Sparda
[1:26:14] <%Divryne> V evolves into Vergil for the DLC. LUL
[1:26:15] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> @angriestpat DmC had a ‘Must Style’ mode where you only did damage on S style ranking or higher. Thoughts on implementation in here?
[1:26:15] <CSeriesJTYPE> V's missions on DMD are not fun
[1:26:16] <redorbmerchant> like he could be an anthology of previous bosses
[1:26:18] <%ScreamingMeat> V bonus should have been Nelo Angelo as a Sin D.T
[1:26:19] <%hntronium> @sir_nack Free DT at SSS rank
[1:26:21] <PrinceOfEden> @valriot I hadn't even considered V for HaH mode yet and now I'm scared. I just finished HoH mode.
[1:26:21] <kryedge> Great, so maybe he´ll free DLC later
[1:26:21] <OkamiDude15> @sir_nack its a move you can use in sin dt at SSS style rank
[1:26:23] <PrinceOfEden> NotLikeThis
[1:26:24] <redorbmerchant> you coudl equip them like the devil arms
[1:26:25] <%skizzuto> Quad S is an ability that makes Dante go into sin DT for free if you're at SSS
[1:26:25] <+Vivaciousx3> imagine if they gave v a transform mechanic
[1:26:27] <oponomo2> Savage Kappa
[1:26:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Five bucks says Vergil is Vs devil trigger in the dlc
[1:26:32] <weontheultralightbeam> D:
[1:26:33] <bonzosan> Don't worry, V's bonus will show up in a few months.
[1:26:35] <%Solidnick18> damn nobody
[1:26:35] <%Hilleltaco> Quadruple S is cool but I was a little disappointed it wasn't actually a 4th S rank
[1:26:36] <+DeRedBaron> i do wish V got something even after the end of the game to at least make him a lot of difficult on the highest difficulites like some movement
[1:26:39] <Jane_Lo> sick D:
[1:26:39] <%Plague_Nurse> @countgaculatv DSD is literally better than those two combined
[1:26:42] <+Jeikujeiku> @AngriestPat I was hoping when he Vergil'ed that he'd retain V's moveset to a degree, with the cane being his other weapon or something. I dont wanna see that moveset just dissapear after this game
[1:26:42] <sir_nack> holy shit i didnt know he got that
[1:26:45] <thekerobit> you can do it!
[1:26:47] <%hntronium> The Heartless hate you too Pat
[1:26:55] <%badchoice5> No use telling them Pat, Nobodys don't have hearts or feelings
[1:26:58] <dukenux> SKRRA
[1:26:58] <VJdarkworld> V should be given a mechanic that is unlocked after beating the game. Like ability to possess enemies
[1:26:59] <Hellarussian> is he using the Yamato?
[1:27:03] <leole11> you can DT tomboy???? fucking HELL
[1:27:03] <jeecay> tomboy with dt = beyond overkill
[1:27:05] <dekkitout> And dont get me started on the Unversed
[1:27:09] <Jew_Gold> Did you know that DT doesn't increase Tomboy damage?
[1:27:10] <%cherubs_anonymous> Can we officially say Nero's the strongest of the Sons of Sparda as of the end of this game?
[1:27:20] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:27:20] <Tucker0603> @hellarussian phantom Yamato
[1:27:20] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> The Tomboy charge shot is the most Bayonetta shit I've ever seen
[1:27:21] <sir_nack> lol
[1:27:22] <+trekkie11041> @Hellarussian a spectural one
[1:27:23] <$lolslowking> @VJdarkworld Or like charming them and then join your side for a time
[1:27:26] <+Austinck> @AngriestPat do you think they will make lady and Trish playable and how would you like them to play?
[1:27:28] <%NopeBadguy> @angriestpat I really wish v got an expanded mechanic where he could like turn into Nelo Angelo
[1:27:31] <+peri_d0t> @cherubs_anonymous probably yeah
[1:27:32] <oponomo2> wtf is this game? WutFace
[1:27:32] <R3c0n31> @AngriestPat When does Geralt appear in DMC?
[1:27:32] <%CerberusDriver> Nero doesnt have an SDT
[1:27:34] <conflict1914> I don't think i'm ever going to master all the mechanics Dante and Nero have to play with, its intimidating just thinking about it
[1:27:36] <bestwaifuritsu> Has Pat seen the 3m taunts yet?
[1:27:37] <saiyan24675> @cherubs_anonymous technically the grandson of Sparda
[1:27:39] <Zombrocom> Why does this level not have music
[1:27:42] <PrinceOfEden> I saw an entertaining mode that changes Nero's description to "The Dead Weight"
[1:27:46] <person181> maybe summon sword?
[1:27:46] <PrinceOfEden> mod*
[1:27:48] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> Does Pat have a fave DMC?
[1:27:48] <%alexandrecau> nero doesn't have his sin dt, he is likely weakr if vergil wasn't tired
[1:27:49] <$lolslowking> I hope Lady is like actually viable
[1:27:57] <Valdorick> You can't make those designs and not use them.
[1:27:58] <buffmurffy> aww, round trip shenanigans are super fun as trish
[1:27:58] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> We need Virgil
[1:28:00] <kryedge> bestwaifuritsu nope
[1:28:01] <Rexenexus> Trish is fucking overpowered
[1:28:02] <kingcroix> is wolllies DMC 5 run on the Ps4 or ps4 pro?
[1:28:04] <Pseudonymity> Trish should just melee more
[1:28:04] <x3as> Lady in DMC4 SE was fucking baller
[1:28:06] <Tucker0603> I fucking love Trish in 4SE
[1:28:07] <+TorshiroXD> @AngriestPat trish's nose so annoyinggg
[1:28:07] <%mitchteck> Do you think trish will get a new weapon?
[1:28:08] <%ScreamingMeat> Has Paige fully faded into the ether?
[1:28:09] <+countgaculatv> @Plague_Nurse Yeah it's better, but that sword is a bit overwhelming with how much it's got going for it and having to monitor. Like legit, I'm trying to style beast with Dante and his Swordmaster move for that sword just sucks for me because it doesn't give me any air time unless I use regular attack in air.
[1:28:10] <T_Sasquatch> @cherubs_anonymous not yet, he has the highest potential. the only reason why nero beat vergil is because he was tired
[1:28:12] <sir_nack> yeah trish's whole thing with round trip if kinda boring
[1:28:13] <ShopperKung> actually it's DMC2 call back @AngriestPat
[1:28:13] <CSeriesJTYPE> you're supposed to stunlock people with her lightning
[1:28:14] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Trish being better DMC1 Dante is why I love her in 4se
[1:28:20] <+QuadraticGravity> Don't give her melee moves, give her """Melee""" moves
[1:28:20] <derekwst3> I think they should of gave V a nelo angelo sin devil trigger, to transform him to a attacker
[1:28:21] <+Risingxiv> Trish felt so button mashy in 4
[1:28:26] <conflict1914> Lady should be able to do some gun stingers
[1:28:29] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> @angriestpat Do u have a fave DMC?
[1:28:29] <artoflec> u tellin me Round Trip aint the coolest shit ever
[1:28:35] <The_Swedish_X> I'm still surprised that run before the final vein isn't a combat zone.
[1:28:38] <sir_nack> lady has shotgun stinger if i remember right
[1:28:39] <%primax104> Really hoping for the ladies and secret char to be playable
[1:28:42] <+Jaromero435> Whats your favorite lvl 3 exceede move?
[1:28:43] <redorbmerchant> whole point of V is that he is a new style
[1:28:46] <+Jeikujeiku> I dont think she needs melee moves but she could use mroe defenisice options like her acrobatics in 3
[1:28:47] <anuchallengertwitch> would you like it if Trish had a more demonic looking devil trigger?
[1:28:47] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[1:28:47] <T_Sasquatch> tier list is still Dante > Vergil > Nero
[1:28:47] <Tucker0603> but only with her Gloria costume, normal Trish looks so boring to me
[1:28:48] <Valdorick> Lady should do Rocket Stingers - she's shoots a rocket, then rides it the enemy.
[1:28:48] <PrinceOfEden> BTW, if you beat Urizen in this mission you also get the secret ending.
[1:28:48] <dioheat180> if they add verigil what do you think his new force edge will be?
[1:28:49] <%Solidnick18> you right
[1:28:53] <+peri_d0t> @sir_nack yeah shotgun stinger was busted
[1:28:56] <CSeriesJTYPE> Trish also has a fucking lightning Eruption
[1:28:56] <%mitchteck> @angriestpat do you think trish will get a new weapon?
[1:29:00] <+countgaculatv> Like legit, how am I to combo if I'm A: falling down and B: having to monitor more because a sword is more powerful?
[1:29:02] <jojimboofthedeep> I like Trish...
[1:29:03] <CSeriesJTYPE> Volcano*
[1:29:03] <artoflec> also they cant just make Trish round trip because Sparda doesn't exist anymore
[1:29:06] <%TheMattman1313> EXCEEDS you EVERY EXPECTATION
[1:29:06] <HollowMan190> do u think Nico should give one of them special gloves to make one of them punch girls
[1:29:07] <%Solidnick18> dang rorb ants
[1:29:11] <derekwst3> With everything destroyed do you think that the magazine was actually dantes
[1:29:12] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Do you think they’d give Vergil his other weapons? I was thinking his Nelo Angelo Sword and gauntlets to replace Force Edge and Beowulf
[1:29:14] <sir_nack> god remember lady's level 3 shotgun charge? that shit did so much damage
[1:29:15] <kryedge> Gosh Nero your dad let´s you have 3 jumps?!
[1:29:16] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Give Trish Alastor
[1:29:20] <%Fidranth> man I know I'm gonns be waiting for a while, but I can't wait for Dragon's Dogma 2
[1:29:28] <%primax104> my reason?
[1:29:28] <VJdarkworld> @lolslowking yeyeye It could be instead of finishing them off. Would make the big enemy room fights less (repeatinng same combo until nightmare explode everything)
[1:29:30] <+Jeikujeiku> SERIOUSLY I miss Alistor so much
[1:29:32] <%primax104> our reason?
[1:29:34] <%Solidnick18> urizen for what?
[1:29:35] <rosemon5001> time to fight PAPA
[1:29:38] <+mcjimbo12> Do any of the other games do anything better than this game? Like that obviously makes me sound super negative about the other games but you know what i mean
[1:29:39] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Can Urizen be beaten in this mission?
[1:29:40] <+Risingxiv> yes, Give Trish Alastor!
[1:29:40] <CSeriesJTYPE> lmao do you really think they would change trish's moveset for story reasons? rebellion fucking BROKE and you can still use it
[1:29:41] <%violetheart> What would she use though?
[1:29:41] <+Austinck> 7.2 no meme dance
[1:29:42] <Tha_Mik> Don't kill him to much
[1:29:47] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> There's actually a mod for that for 4 and other than the hitboxes being bigger than the model it's rad af
[1:29:47] <%Ganerumo> built entirely around Balrog mechanics but lightning would be dope
[1:29:48] <+asgard147> it would make sense
[1:29:48] <%skizzuto> what would she use then?
[1:29:48] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Mission 8 Urizen win?
[1:29:49] <%ScreamingMeat> Either an entirely new moveset or Alastor
[1:29:49] <derekwst3> I want a updated Lucia
[1:29:49] <troxcree> Just give her Alistor.
[1:29:51] <Pseudonymity> just give her Blitz moves
[1:29:51] <+Afrobrawler> i'd love for that, full lighning mage trish
[1:29:51] <tri3dgE027> Is Alastor even still in Dante's office? From the DMC5 cutscene, it is no longer framed behind his wall
[1:29:55] <+DeRedBaron> im hoping she doesn't not just cus like her SE version but also cus it's been asorbed into Dante
[1:29:56] <%FrustratedAF> V?!?!?
[1:29:57] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL watch her use Cavaliere
[1:30:00] <mayorrev> Y E E T
[1:30:00] <+tyrant00000> tyrant00000 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:30:00] <closetgremlin12> Well if it takes place after DMC5 than she can't use Sparda
[1:30:00] <$lolslowking> @VJdarkworld I'm super down with that idea. I doubt they ever modify his kit, but I'd like more to do.
[1:30:02] <FenixSeraph> did Dante sell Alastor
[1:30:04] <buffmurffy> I guess the story may be better in 3 vs this game
[1:30:05] <+Zaramoth> Has pat ever figured out how to max act as good as woolie
[1:30:06] <+Jeikujeiku> We have an HD alistor model in Monster Hunter too
[1:30:07] <CSeriesJTYPE> rebellion fucking SHATTERED INTO PIECES
[1:30:09] <Valdorick> He sold Allister for hot water.
[1:30:12] <Artista_AF> that would be cool, give her new devil arms, Dante sells them im sure she kept at least one
[1:30:12] <$lolslowking> Tomboy fuckin rules
[1:30:12] <HollowMan190> punch gloves
[1:30:14] <%ScreamingMeat> Alastor makes so much sense as a weapon for Trish
[1:30:14] <%primax104> what happens when you do Tomboy + Devil Trigger
[1:30:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> Sassy
[1:30:17] <$megamonmon123> @fenixseraph yeah and he ended up om viewtiful joe
[1:30:20] <sir_nack> guys this is where woolie max acted
[1:30:23] <+Jeikujeiku> @FenixSeraph if he did he's dead to me
[1:30:23] <raincoatponch> maybe trish can use whatever she used when she was prtending to be gloria
[1:30:25] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat Will we get DLC of Dante going to Patty's bday party?
[1:30:27] <PrinceOfEden> Dante doesn't like to think about DMC2 so he got rid of all those Devil Arms. LUL
[1:30:29] <%RageKingDomo> its a little unrealistic to want lady to have melee attacks as shes only human and mainly uses a bazookkaaaa
[1:30:32] <The_Swedish_X> You might be just scrapping that S rank
[1:30:32] <derekwst3> I think Trish having any of dante's old weapons would work for her
[1:30:35] <$D4C_Trice> Trish might use Alastor or something from Cavalier Angelo
[1:30:35] <%Mornaka> WOO
[1:30:38] <+Zaramoth> well
[1:30:38] <eagerdigger> @mcjimbo12 That doesn't come off as negative, tbh, that just means they learned how to improve on their systems over time. Progress and refinement is good.
[1:30:38] <conflict1914> Honestly I still prefer Nero's DT stand over his regular DT if we're just going by aesthetics
[1:30:39] <%Solidnick18> damn it
[1:30:40] <%EdViper> yeyeye

[1:31:03] <blue6sub6remnant6> So, Trish is kind of coded to be lightning, yes? If she doesn't have Sparda/Force Edge, would you give her Alastor?
[1:31:03] <person181> time to beat the last boss
[1:31:04] <troxcree> I keep forgetting and then the scenes start.

[1:31:31] <%alexandrecau> @blaine_themono you can always kill urizen no matter the mission
[1:31:32] <lozscat> Dante jerky is pizza
[1:31:32] <+Dovakhin573> So can you beat urizen like in the prologue here?

[1:32:09] <$megamonmon123> just almost kill him pat
[1:32:10] <person181> i forgot he had a real voice
[1:32:11] <+mcjimbo12> @RageKingDomo No, when he doesn't have his arm or Yamato or his DT unlocked, he's only human
[1:32:15] <Tha_Mik> Don't kill him too hard pat
[1:32:17] <%NWR_James> Man dude is so not afraid of you he doesnt even bother to stand up
[1:32:24] <%KaironFortressKnight> Man, Dan's voice is so great.
[1:32:25] <%ScreamingMeat> I love hoe butthurt Nero is over being called Dead Weight
[1:32:32] <%terminallyCapriciousz> I want nero to randomly shout out with "MASTODON!"
[1:32:33] <%alexandrecau> make him accept your existence
[1:32:33] <conflict1914> Quick massage him till he doesn't want to kill humanity
[1:32:33] <%RageKingDomo> Thats literally not how this works sonny boy @mcjimbo12
[1:32:33] <Manwad> Can you deflect those fireballs?
[1:32:38] <$MightyMaxT> I don't understand why everyone calls Nero "kid" or "child" He's at least 27 here, right?
[1:32:40] <FenixSeraph> if you time it right you can hit the meteors back
[1:32:43] <aiyobro> He's Seath, the Scale less
[1:32:44] <gekizenbu> Nero was so pissed about dead weight for a solid month
[1:32:45] <%KaironFortressKnight> So what difficulty is Pat on? SoS or DMD?
[1:32:45] <Manwad> Radical
[1:32:45] <alrobot2014> @Manwad yes

[1:32:47] <conflict1914> Yes you can, either a well timed swing or gerbera can knock em back

[1:32:51] <%Ion_LaserX> @KaironFortressKnight SoS
[1:32:57] <+Delror> @MightyMaxT i'm pretty sure he's only like 22 or 23

[1:33:07] <person181> that thing has so much health
[1:33:10] <%joylent_blue> MightyMaxT i know people that are like 50 that call 30 somethings "kids"

[1:33:31] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @primax104 "I'm a frog, Urizen..."
[1:33:33] <LoudBog> Did someone make the Mod for PC were everyone Title is just Dead Weight?
[1:33:36] <+Austinck> unleash crazy talk on him
[1:33:37] <+mcjimbo12> @RageKingDomo One of the bosses (Malphas i think?) literally says "No demon power runs through your veins". Goliath refers to him as a "mere human". Dante calls him out for not having any power to which nero says his mechanical arm is "all the power he needs"
[1:33:40] <tri3dgE027> Pat flexing some of that $20.00 Woolie Tech
[1:33:42] <%FrustratedAF> like did virgil fuck because he thought nutting could make him more powerful?
[1:33:43] <aiyobro> did nero just say "no homo?"
[1:33:45] <PrinceOfEden> Try using Nero's launcher instead of running away from the laser
[1:33:47] <Sapphire_Breeze> @LoudBog there is one like that for Nero LUL
[1:33:53] <Nina96> @aiyobro that means u have a soul

[1:34:02] <%Trinity5> @aiyobro go home already is what he says
[1:34:03] <gekizenbu> @FrustratedAF Vergil can only think in terms of Power
[1:34:06] <Valdorick> Beat up your arm some more, Nero!
[1:34:06] <+mcjimbo12> @RageKingDomo He also can't charge his gun, which was a demon-powered move, until he regrows his arm and learns DT
[1:34:08] <The_Swedish_X> I wonder why the Yamato gets the crystal over it for these fights.
[1:34:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> "You're nothing but a maggot" right as he says that "Wow!"
[1:34:12] <%Solidnick18> oh shit
[1:34:14] <$megamonmon123> this was a zone fight foe me

[1:34:21] <sir_nack> @mcjimbo12 the bosses are just assuming from nero's appearance, bosses in 3 did the same to dante.
[1:34:22] <derekwst3> do you think trish will have a different moveset since she wont have the sword anymore canonly

[1:38:45] <+trekkie11041> it ends when you break his shield @AngriestPat
[1:38:54] <+Marsidicus> You can beat that version as Nero in mission 8.
[1:38:55] <Dips3095> what difficulty is it?
[1:38:56] <gekizenbu> i still love that someone posted that Dante could Faust Hat the first Dante vs Urizen fight and break everything
[1:38:58] <aizt> no it doesnt

[1:39:03] <%Ion_LaserX> @Dips3095 son of sparda
[1:39:03] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat You can totally beat that Urizen as nero
[1:39:04] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> no you can deplete his health
[1:39:04] <$megamonmon123> @trekkie11041 no it doesnt thats when he is seated
[1:39:10] <CSeriesJTYPE> I was hoping theres were going to be the motion capture sessions honestly
[1:39:14] <tri3dgE027> When live-action Morrison is more anime-accurate than game Morrison
[1:39:15] <Valdorick> They cast an Asian guy as a blackman!? WHITE WASHING! Kappa
[1:39:15] <+Fresh_Hot_Fresh> That's not even a real pizza box...
[1:39:16] <weontheultralightbeam> @countgaculatv sadly i dont but you get the same thing if you beat him in the prologue (but i think the credits shows a little more footage of the game)
[1:39:18] <Dips3095> thanks
[1:39:18] <RavenickSA> Hi Pat
[1:39:19] <+Demon_Ace_Cipher> it does the same thing as beating him at the beginning
[1:39:21] <kryedge> So now we have an asian, a white, and a black morrison. Nice.
[1:39:25] <%nameless_majin> Does anyone know why the live scenes still use DMC 4 ost?
[1:39:26] <%Solidnick18> patty is from the anime
[1:39:30] <+trekkie11041> @megamonmon123 my bad my mistake
[1:39:31] <%Plague_Nurse> That's a lie
[1:39:35] <+HoloToast> the pizza is the script
[1:39:40] <%lloyddboy> FAKE PIZZA BOX
[1:39:42] <person181> an empty pizza box, how sad
[1:39:42] <RavenickSA> Is this Dead Stranding?
[1:39:43] <The_Swedish_X> @nameless_majin because this was all before they final ost was made
[1:39:44] <+DeRedBaron> because by this point the OST for dmc5 wasn't made or complete
[1:39:46] <weontheultralightbeam> @countgaculatv i also did it on human difficulty to see if its possible
[1:39:46] <%Remery_> Dante put a baby in Patty, give Nero a cousin!

[1:44:09] <+countgaculatv> Dante, Son of Spada
[1:44:09] <Rexenexus> SPADA is correct.
[1:44:09] <%Rathalos2006> They did so much to avoid saying Vergil during the run up the reveal that I was actually convinced that it WAS ALL just a massive red herring meant to troll everyone.
[1:44:09] <Tha_Mik> DEVIL SWORD SPADA

[1:44:18] <redorbmerchant> its my turn now, its your turn
[1:44:21] <%joylent_blue> CerberusDriver he does though? how are we looking at the same thing and seeing different things
[1:44:21] <%CerberusDriver> @Spyderninja Nobodies are from DMC1
[1:44:22] <%cheeseblook> cheeseblook subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! This is literally my first DMC game -ever- and I am failing to get less than S ranks on each mission. git gud scrub crybaby game journos.
[1:44:22] <$megamonmon123> V is a great nobody
[1:44:24] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat Nobodies are weird RE2 holdovers.
[1:44:26] <%primax104> devil sword espatada

[1:44:52] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat My favorite part about the RE Engine is that they have the technology to make V bite his lip to make the ‘v’ sound with the greatest detail possible

[1:46:50] <%Trinity5> @joylent_blue ye
[1:46:54] <anuchallengertwitch> So pat, If Elmo is your Shadow, who would be your Griffon and Nightmare?
[1:46:55] <$megamonmon123> @wonkydong oops all s's
[1:46:59] <%cheeseblook> Not being able to get an SSS with him is an indication of brain damage
[1:47:04] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Elmo HATE camera
[1:47:05] <+Austinck> V is still so much like gundam from dangronpa 2, their both villanous goth edgelord anti-heores who fight using animals

[1:47:43] <%cheeseblook> We are BORN by the BAG, DIE by the BAG

[1:47:44] <alrobot2014> have y'all not seen the pic of paige as griffon and woolie as nightmare?
[1:47:46] <%Zaramoth> im split between paige and woolie for being pats nightmare. Both would be equally amazing for bodyslam entrances
[1:47:52] <Phoenon> I never really used the enhance summons with DT Bars in my playthrough, yeah whoops
[1:47:58] <mayorrev> what does reading do again? free DT?
[1:47:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paige can't be Pat's nobody. she doesn't have an X in her name.

[1:49:24] <+sleepymastiff> Elmo's gotta let it out gotta let it out

[1:49:31] <%CerberusDriver> Crystal Lizards can attack in SoS mode

[1:49:34] <%JJCheeker> Just one more hair and Elmo get clean he promises apatWink
[1:49:34] <+LeoStrahl> Paige is V as the Elmo mancer, Pat is Nero by dint of being short and loving to litter with his used romantic rubber fists, Woolie is Vergil (Naturally) not sure who takes Dante though
[1:49:35] <+atlasbot1> @AngriestPat did V tell dante the demon was vergil and only tell nere his name was urizen
[1:49:36] <%joylent_blue> someone hire JYB to voice the Dead Weight copypasta someone made
[1:49:41] <jeecay> @Shadicara he makes his gingers do his bidding. Like V
[1:49:43] <BlackMage66652> Who does V's alt style lines? Is it still Nico?

[1:50:15] <%nameless_majin> @blackmage66652 yea it’s still Nico
[1:50:19] <toxoglossan> every time I hear V say "take that" I think of Xavier warrior angel saying "Taste the pain"
[1:50:19] <+mcjimbo12> @cheeseblook Actually i think you'll find it's "hahahaAHAHAHAHHA FUCK YEAH"

[1:50:29] <anuchallengertwitch> @cheeseblook Yes, people curse alot in this game.
[1:50:30] <+Shadicara> Confirmed Pat and Paige are Elmo's Nightmare
[1:50:30] <jeecay> Butt Bug escaped

[1:50:38] <%primax104> oh, I hate the firebats
[1:50:39] <%violetheart> It's almost like Pat is using the alternate announcer that makes Nico do the style announcements.
[1:50:42] <BreakTheBarrier> I'm so bad at playing V lol
[1:50:43] <%cheeseblook> Griffon is easily a favorite
[1:50:44] <%primax104> they are super annoying
[1:50:46] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@arran_throttle) (warning)
[1:50:46] <conflict1914> I love Nightmare's entrances
[1:50:48] <HairballCT> Cursing? In MY M-rated game???
[1:50:52] <%Freelance7> For Dante, the style announcer is different
[1:50:53] <shotgang86> L1 drop
[1:50:53] <%CerberusDriver> Nightmare is just the FUCK THIS button

[1:51:10] <%cheeseblook> Remember kids: Cool people curse, but they do it in moderation and with good timing
[1:51:10] <CSeriesJTYPE> at first I didnt pick up on the fact that V's hair wasnt TURNING white when you summon Nightmare, its actually Nightmare making it black
[1:51:13] <%cheeseblook> YES WE DID
[1:51:13] <Jrockoni> Pat you gonna bother making a clan for Division 2?
[1:51:15] <BlackMage66652> So who has more MOTIVATION: V or Vergil?
[1:51:16] <mayorrev> YEYEYE
[1:51:17] <%wolfofsound> @TheOnlyStrayCat thought you were Jebaited
[1:51:17] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I love V so much

[1:51:28] <gunzerkingdunce> Singing in the rain?
[1:51:30] <%joylent_blue> V being Vergil makes all his high style taunts hilarious
[1:51:31] <+mcjimbo12> @CSeriesJTYPE oh fuck

[1:51:38] <%Klefth> Imagine Vergil doing that shit
[1:51:39] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @wolfofsound Fair point.
[1:51:39] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat theres a model swap with Vergils and V's of him doing the tapdance and its the dopest shit he has the biggest smile on his face
[1:51:42] <$valriot> Love how Vergils human side is a huge virgin loser
[1:51:43] <+sleepymastiff> tap dances in sandals
[1:51:43] <%Tearonex> Still like the Violin better
[1:51:47] <CSeriesJTYPE> hahaha its a pretty neat detail
[1:51:48] <ventus_fury> Wow, I'm way behind, pat has so many red orbs, I'm jealous
[1:51:48] <%primax104> was vergil a theater kid?
[1:51:48] <KenshinTheLostFlareon> hey everyone, what's up Pat?
[1:51:51] <anuchallengertwitch> The best thing about V is that he reveals how much of a dork Vergil actually is
[1:51:51] <Klarrann3> @AngriestPat Do you not like V's EX skin?
[1:51:52] <%joylent_blue> bestwaifuritsu i need this RIGHT NOW
[1:51:53] <jeecay> @primax104 Another one of his repressed phases. Like his sandal and goth phase
[1:51:55] <dukenux> D I E
[1:51:56] <LiquidMathew> So is V proof that being stylish is a human trait?
[1:51:58] <%JJCheeker> Every time I see V's cain I think of bloodborne
[1:52:03] <CSeriesJTYPE> but when I realized that his tattoos disappear when you summon the other two I was like oh shit
[1:52:03] <+mcjimbo12> @valriot every character in this series apart from like 2 is a huge virgin loser
[1:52:08] <$megamonmon123> @primax104 he was canonically a book worm
[1:52:18] <+LeoStrahl> I love that V blends into Vergil, because it means that Vergil=loves to read poetry, play the air violin/pretend to compose when no ones watching, and took tap dancing lessons at some point in time
[1:52:18] <DagetStreams> I think you're WRONG
[1:52:18] <dukenux> I think Flight of the Valkyries is betee
[1:52:20] <Animal_Farm4> Excuse me sir, conducting Flight of the Valkyries is the best taunt DansGame
[1:52:20] <Rexenexus> There's a mod that changes his EX skin to Vergil's blue outfit.
[1:52:20] <marvel877> I prefer his twirl in the air taunt.
[1:52:21] <$valriot> @mcjimbo12 Exactly
[1:52:21] <$GoogleyGareth> God I hate those dudes
[1:52:23] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat but you cant put memeable songs to the violin
[1:52:24] <conflict1914> I thought you meant his EX taunt i was about to kill you
[1:52:27] <Varanoo> I'M SINGING IN THE RAIN taunt is cool
[1:52:27] <%ScreamingMeat> I also like his conducting Rise of the Valkyries
[1:52:28] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> So V would absolutely do the Time Warp with Tim Curry and the gang, right?
[1:52:30] <Fiendmaw> Ride of the Valkyries is way better
[1:52:34] <lemon_lore> would it be wierd if v fight vergil again
[1:52:39] <%KaironFortressKnight> Fucking Juddecas are a nightmare as V.
[1:52:41] <%mitchteck> Why is the v ex a spoiler?
[1:52:42] <PrinceOfEden> Some of V's fights were hell on DMD mode. I can only imagine HAH mode. evoWutFace
[1:52:44] <%lloyddboy> ARE YOU FOR REAL
[1:52:44] <+doe3879> there's a vergil outfit for V mod
[1:52:45] <CSeriesJTYPE> @LeoStrahl yeah its actually really great characterization, especially when he hands nero the book
[1:52:47] <PrinceOfEden> WutFace **
[1:52:52] <%KaironFortressKnight> Especially on DMD
[1:52:53] <%JJCheeker> Actually this area kind of looks like nightmare Of mensis
[1:52:55] <$D4C_Trice> how do you get V's EX colour?
[1:52:55] <%joylent_blue> mitchteck it has the same design as Vergil's coat
[1:52:56] <BlackMage66652> V is proof that Vergil is tsundere for life itself.
[1:52:57] <+mcjimbo12> @lemon_lore Nah I think V could have fought Vergil in like, the mind-dimension
[1:52:59] <CapTaySparta> Oh Hi Nightmare
[1:53:00] <jeecay> nice
[1:53:02] <%cherubs_anonymous> yeeessh

[1:53:18] <mayorrev> rip SSS
[1:53:18] <LiquidMathew> @mitchteck the color scheme and pattern is Vergil's from 3
[1:53:20] <+Shadicara> JUDGEMENT NUT
[1:53:21] <T_Sasquatch> so i just started the god eater 3 demo and the default name is "protagonist" LUL

[1:53:23] <anuchallengertwitch> Judgement stab
[1:53:23] <PrinceOfEden> That's my favorite cane kill as V
[1:53:25] <+mcjimbo12> @mitchteck because it totally looks like vergil's dmc3 outfit but you only unlock it when that plot "twist" has happened so it's not really a spoil

[1:53:26] <person181> DMC that's how
[1:53:26] <sileo_patronus> good game

[1:53:33] <%Straylightgg> @AngriestPat what's yr hour count at this point?
[1:53:34] <PrinceOfEden> Takes its arm and kills him with it
[1:53:35] <+CampinSteve> Apparently there's a rumor that bloody palace will be COOP. Thoughts?
[1:53:37] <+Austinck> He did it
[1:53:38] <%Tearonex> excluding bosses of course

[1:55:31] <%cheeseblook> He started with DMC 3 so he was happy to see me get in, I'm actually the one who paid his way on 5 too :P
[1:55:34] <bonzosan> This scene is so interesting in context
[1:55:36] <BlackMage66652> Pat had a stroke

[1:55:59] <+sleepymastiff> he was straight chillin in the coffin?
[1:56:03] <%cheeseblook> 5 is doing a damn fine job getting people on board as it is rewarding longtime fans with a good game
[1:56:05] <%primax104> illegal move is amazing
[1:56:17] <%joylent_blue> Dark Souls has box rats, DMC has box demons
[1:56:18] <+wsmccall> you should check out photo mode - i'm sure you can actually read V's poetry book with it
[1:56:20] <+sleepymastiff> Not much of a fan of nightmare. I think he's too slow
[1:56:21] <+CampinSteve> my expectations were exceeded
[1:56:34] <CSeriesJTYPE> whats unclear is if the illusion of dante and vergils old house before the urizen boss means that when they were kids, Red Grave City wasnt there
[1:56:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> tfw you forget you're at work and RIP a massive fart
[1:56:47] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat If you only have Griffin out, V has a special taunt where he speaks to Shadow in his hand (Still unsummoned)
[1:56:48] <conflict1914> I love nightmare, just because he's such a good brick wall
[1:56:49] <+CampinSteve> @rumtumtugnutz thats just your s rank taunt
[1:56:54] <PrinceOfEden> I got it earlier and grabbed a screencap of it
[1:56:56] <CSeriesJTYPE> it makes me think the city was built up around their old house when they all left
[1:57:02] <dekkitout> That's a pretty bold taunt
[1:57:09] <+raisinbreadistasty> Nah, Red Grave was there, since apparently Dante now gets the name "Tony Redgrave" from the city
[1:57:11] <mayorrev> PogChamp

[1:57:22] <%ScreamingMeat> Ignore the DT orb
[1:57:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But Dantes fake name was Tony Redgrave
[1:57:25] <%ArcanumMBD> You know what else wouldve given DT? That orb you ran past
[1:57:27] <+sleepymastiff> shank shank shank
[1:57:28] <Megapikman132> @AngriestPat You're getting mo DT on those extending finishers
[1:57:28] <%CerberusDriver> ignores DT orb
[1:57:28] <CSeriesJTYPE> yeah I thought about that, but part of me wonders if he didnt just take that name after deciding to go back
[1:57:29] <alwayspronking> How do you do the cool executions lke that?
[1:57:30] <%cheeseblook> Ignore the DTORD
[1:57:30] <Jane_Lo> @raisinbreadistasty that's how it was anime
[1:57:30] <%RageKingDomo> you just passed a worb lmao
[1:57:31] <Valdorick> He got Dee Tea
[1:57:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> they didn't name the city after him
[1:57:34] <anuchallengertwitch> V tapped into his in Spy
[1:57:36] <bearalin> Is pat feeling better?
[1:57:36] <%cheeseblook> *DTORB
[1:57:37] <redorbmerchant> dont you dare pick up the dt orbs

[1:57:43] <%joylent_blue> i think their childhood house being in an empty field was more representative of a paradise dimension than anything else
[1:57:43] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> He already has all the orbs
[1:57:44] <MrMysteryMask> im gonna need some DT. Ignorst the WORBS
[1:57:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> it was a pretty brazen taunt.
[1:57:49] <+CampinSteve> I assume on SOS a lot of green orb trees and DT orbs are gone?
[1:57:50] <%bigboy3d> Norizen
[1:57:53] <%RageKingDomo> @cheeseblook Its a WORB SIR
[1:57:54] <Spyderninja> clipped Elmo accidentally scratching you xD
[1:57:57] <%primax104> oh wow, magic boys this early
[1:57:59] <CSeriesJTYPE> @joylent_blue I guess so
[1:57:59] <+mcjimbo12> Ok so sidenote in Dante's second mission. That whole set up with the blood pools is running through like residential areas/streets filled with cars. Was that just a feature of the city? The pool of blood?
[1:58:11] <CSeriesJTYPE> dont ask
[1:58:13] <PrinceOfEden> @CampinSteve Yep, and on DMD mode, they don't even spawn. No devil breakers either. Only get them through fights.
[1:58:14] <%cheeseblook> @RageKingDomo I'll call it a DTORB and you /can't stop me/
[1:58:14] <BlackMage66652> @mcjimbo12 Demon magic
[1:58:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> On DMD there are almost no devil breakers anywhere
[1:58:23] <Frolomeo> 2 health bars? What is this horse shit?
[1:58:29] <%Zaramoth> V gameplay feels weirdly like dragons dogma at times
[1:58:36] <%primax104> @mcjimbo12 probably one of spencer's many properties
[1:58:39] <%joylent_blue> this area also looks like Dragon's Dogma
[1:58:40] <%cheeseblook> Pat needs all the health he can get, he's a stubby lad after all
[1:58:40] <+mcjimbo12> @BlackMage66652 you right you right
[1:58:42] <+CampinSteve> i dont like playing nero anyways
[1:58:46] <%RageKingDomo> @cheeseblook Youre gonna ruin it for the rest of uS!
[1:58:47] <+CampinSteve> not that big of a deal for me
[1:58:48] <%CerberusDriver> SAVIOR BLOODSTAINED
[1:58:52] <%bigboy3d> Yeah the blood thing is quite bizarre
[1:58:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> @mcjimbo12 you mean your city doesn't run on blood?
[1:58:53] <%joylent_blue> not liking playing Nero DansGame
[1:58:56] <%Hilleltaco> HELLFIRE SHADOW
[1:58:57] <tri3dgE027> Who said that's blood, that's Kool Aid
[1:59:00] <%TheFilth> fucking hell the dynamic soundtracks makes this a 12/10 for me
[1:59:04] <conflict1914> why is griffon's divebomb move so damaging
[1:59:05] <+mcjimbo12> @TheOneCalledRock maybe that's why it's called Red Grave
[1:59:09] <%joylent_blue> Nero is the most fun for me
[1:59:09] <%Freelance7> Nero is my favorite to play
[1:59:10] <%cheeseblook> Nero's my fav :V
[1:59:12] <+CampinSteve> I play DMC for Dante and melee weapons
[1:59:12] <Jane_Lo> i think nero is the most balanced from boring to hard
[1:59:14] <shotgang86> BLOODSTAIN, SHADOW
[1:59:14] <+TheoTTree> BLAAAAAST
[1:59:17] <%violetheart> Exceed and the Devil Breakers are fantastic.
[1:59:19] <EnderGamma> I like calibur
[1:59:22] <Valdorick> @mcjimbo12 "Come to majestic Redgrave City. See our abandoned SPADA mansion, tour on our subway, visit the central hellish blood pools."
[1:59:24] <BlackMage66652> Dante is the best, you heathens!
[1:59:24] <BreakTheBarrier> D I E
[1:59:24] <+Austinck> why can't get devil arms like dante
[1:59:26] <%skizzuto> you make exceed look way easier than it is
[1:59:27] <faldin> I have a hard time getting exceeds
[1:59:28] <Smart_ZaK1> Can you clash with the cane?
[1:59:29] <%cheeseblook> Let's give 'em a little taste of tha GOOD SHIT
[1:59:30] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I'm not the biggest fan of playing Nero. I prefer playing V and Dante
[1:59:31] <rekinom> Pog
[1:59:31] <%Ion_LaserX> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[1:59:32] <The_Swedish_X> How would Nero with Sparda even play as?
[1:59:33] <%TheFilth> NICE
[1:59:33] <+CampinSteve> I fell in love with well timed DT pops on the fist weapons
[1:59:33] <The_Sorrow_> PogChamp
[1:59:33] <OfficiallyFlynn> NICER
[1:59:33] <%joylent_blue> holy fuck
[1:59:33] <%Piemen99> HOT
[1:59:34] <Megapikman132> INSTANT S
[1:59:34] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> quick do it again
[1:59:37] <+tigerfang86> SHIT SON
[1:59:39] <%primax104> V and Nero definitely have more coherent kits than Dante
[1:59:40] <conflict1914> oh fuck you can do the instant kill with V?
[1:59:40] <%KaironFortressKnight> FUCK
[1:59:40] <T_Sasquatch> no
[1:59:41] <+sleepymastiff> DOPE
[1:59:41] <grayjammer> IM CUMMING
[1:59:42] <CSeriesJTYPE> my favorte thing about nero is how every move you exceed makes it look like the sword is throwing him around and hes just holding on for dear life
[1:59:43] <shotgang86> oh yes, the worst enemy to V fight
[1:59:44] <%cheeseblook> Instant S made Nico SPLOOSH
[1:59:45] <mechslayer71> Look at this dude living in 2004 LUL
[1:59:46] <The_Swedish_X> Would his DT just hold it like the Yamato in 4?
[1:59:49] <%Rathalos2006> HACKS
[1:59:50] <troxcree> I feel like Nero is certainly more fun once you've hit the post game.
[1:59:52] <OldOnyx> God, I hope Lady's Night is a real thing
[1:59:53] <%cheeseblook> GROOVY
[1:59:54] <%primax104> Dante just does everything
[1:59:54] <+Sipulisoturi> nero is stylish and versatile, dante is just skilled badassery
[1:59:56] <NeetKiller> I like V, I just wish there was more he could do
[1:59:56] <dukenux> GROOVY BABY
[2:00:03] <%joylent_blue> TWO PROTOS?
[2:00:11] <MoroseLoki> Neros Motorcycle Swords great and this guy seems interesting as well
[2:00:13] <LiquidMathew> Post Game Nero is great, such a complete feeling character
[2:00:13] <%nameless_majin> What mode is this btw?
[2:00:17] <$valriot> This area is a nightmare on DMD
[2:00:18] <BlackMage66652> SUPER SASSY SEXY
[2:00:18] <+TheoTTree> SoS
[2:00:19] <+mcjimbo12> Nero is my favourite because he basically just plays as if someone took all of dante's best moves from the series, put them into the same character, then gave that character THREE radical extra mechanics (buster,breakers, exceed and colour up to a lesser extent)
[2:00:21] <+CampinSteve> I like Nero's combo where he smashes his sword on the ground a bunch, forget which one it is. B or C. I'll exceed while doing it and its fun
[2:00:21] <conflict1914> son of sparda
[2:00:21] <+raisinbreadistasty> I wonder if they'll let Vergil use V's style in DMC6 as a style change thing a la Dante
[2:00:22] <%cheeseblook> Nico, stop splooshin
[2:00:24] <+raisinbreadistasty> I think that would be crazy
[2:00:33] <anuchallengertwitch> @NeetKiller Well, he tried to get Phantom in the manga, but it didn't work out.
[2:00:36] <+CampinSteve> vegin might be playable
[2:00:38] <outrogabriel> damg sponges
[2:00:39] <jeecay> this isin't a fight. it's a gang assault
[2:00:39] <%badchoice5> Pat is too hard on himself, he is fucking great at this game
[2:00:39] <%MisterRockett> You haven't changed the music, Pat?
[2:00:41] <tri3dgE027> Oh noe...Nightmare's attack isn't hitting due to the floor
[2:00:43] <+CampinSteve> there's already a vergin mod
[2:00:53] <%Freelance7> I wish they bring V back. I like his and Griffon's dynamic.
[2:00:56] <+raisinbreadistasty> Because you could just have Vergil using the Yamato like he uses the cane here
[2:00:59] <%cheeseblook> git gud pat
[2:01:01] <%joylent_blue> I set V's battle music to Ultra Violet after 1st playthrough
[2:01:08] <BlackMage66652> I hope we get Vergil DLC or something. I need more MOTIVATION.
[2:01:12] <%TheFilth> skewer is such a good move for raw damage
[2:01:12] <%nameless_majin> “No escap-EEErrggh”
[2:01:20] <ArbysLiker1969> I hope V and griffon come back, I like them
[2:01:26] <CSeriesJTYPE> skewer does crazy damage

[2:01:53] <%primax104> the protos are talking
[2:02:02] <+raisinbreadistasty> Vergil doing the violin taunt with Yamato would be amazing
[2:02:02] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat can you parry with V's cane?
[2:02:05] <%primax104> that's really cool
[2:02:06] <+tigerfang86> S C R E M

[2:02:54] <CSeriesJTYPE> @cheeseblook his tattoos disappear when you summon griffon and shadow
[2:02:55] <eclipse36__> Bad way of describing it
[2:02:56] <%skizzuto> makes sense since vergil has naturally white hair
[2:02:56] <Andrade9T> didnt he came out of virgil black haired ?
[2:02:56] <MetelStar> So are we saying that dreams are made winding through V's hair?
[2:02:56] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Also his tatoos.
[2:02:57] <%cheeseblook> OH MY GOD
[2:02:57] <+HoloToast> and Griffon is the pubes
[2:02:57] <CapTaySparta> nightmare
[2:02:59] <+Donutjulio> Ya when V is born his hair is white, it turns black soon after
[2:02:59] <%nameless_majin> apatHoldon
[2:02:59] <dmysta3000> Nightmare Goo in his hair sounds gross
[2:02:59] <+tigerfang86> His hair IS Nightmare
[2:03:00] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat V's idle animation is him trying to slick his hair back constantly
[2:03:00] <+ahdurian> how did you not know this already?
[2:03:01] <%VanaSkiller> oohhhh
[2:03:01] <troxcree> Oh wow
[2:03:01] <%Hilleltaco> @AngriestPat Same thing with his tattoos, which disappear a bit when you summon Griffon and Shadow
[2:03:01] <weontheultralightbeam> best cutscene LUL
[2:03:02] <%primax104> yes, much better than Kala kola
[2:03:02] <+CampinSteve> LOL
[2:03:02] <%zafooru> is nightmare just a hair dye elemental???
[2:03:03] <NeetKiller> Nightmare hair gel LUL
[2:03:03] <anuchallengertwitch> Nightmare is his hair Dye
[2:03:04] <+mcjimbo12> Everything assumed it was like DmC where white=demon power @AngriestPat
[2:03:04] <Jane_Lo> god, that's such a nice detail
[2:03:04] <ArbysLiker1969> bayo?
[2:03:04] <%Nobrev> @zafooru they're in his arm tattoos. they're all made of ink
[2:03:04] <%Plague_Nurse> So Nightmare is now hair dye
[2:03:05] <SpiritsRiseR2> ...
[2:03:06] <%zafooru> oh OH MAN

[2:03:18] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Griffon and Shadow are the tattos
[2:03:18] <%ScreamingMeat> Nightmare Brand Hair gel, or Nightmare Hair Dye?
[2:03:19] <JanusII> What a segue.
[2:03:19] <%nameless_majin> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:03:20] <%Rathalos2006> His tattoos fade when he summons Shadow and Gryphon.

[2:03:24] <+HoloToast> oh yeah, you can see the tattoos real good during the Van cutscene in mission 4
[2:03:25] <weontheultralightbeam> i wonder how they got paid to do this LUL
[2:03:25] <+CampinSteve> this is everything I wanted it to be
[2:03:27] <+LeoStrahl> Interpretive dance... Fiendish... This ends now!
[2:03:27] <MeGrimlock69> or if not does anyone know how to unlock V's ex color
[2:03:27] <%primax104> Birdman is great
[2:03:28] <bestwaifuritsu> Nightmare is his hair, Shadow is his arms and Griffon is his body tats
[2:03:29] <viridianowl> Is this Filthy Frank?
[2:03:29] <%TheFilth> oh no it's Melee players
[2:03:30] <narusao> so edgy
[2:03:30] <person181> seems like there was a panic at the disco
[2:03:30] <Jew_Gold> his tats are shadow and griffon
[2:03:32] <dukenux> Oh right.
[2:03:32] <Andrade9T> Crazy Talk
[2:03:32] <SpiritsRiseR2> oh my god
[2:03:34] <Dragon_Batman> Sup Pat sup everybody
[2:03:37] <%TheShal> How ya feelin' Pat? Still down with the sickness?
[2:03:38] <arran_throttle> don't join the cult kids
[2:03:39] <dukenux> I remember about his Ink being magical
[2:03:39] <+Austinck> Is their a reason why they all look like the dmc one bosses
[2:03:42] <bearalin> What the hell did I walk into?
[2:03:43] <BlackMage66652> Live action Griffon is the best
[2:03:43] <%alexandrecau> my turn with the spada
[2:03:44] <+cahv123> This is so Japan's style too it's just cringy in a great way.
[2:03:47] <%Rathalos2006> In the sequence where you have to regain them one at a time he has no tattoos
[2:03:49] <+stelfury> well his tattoos were obvious since you're shown that shit but his hair gel is surprising
[2:03:50] <%maskedriderhero> Also his white hair is his demonic remnant, the black is his human self. To call upon Nightmare he has to shed his human power and return to demonic strength
[2:03:52] <sileo_patronus> man fuck nobodies
[2:03:58] <%zafooru> nightmare likes to watch
[2:03:59] <+CampinSteve> just get good
[2:04:00] <+mcjimbo12> @Austinck yeah they're made up of Vergil's negative memories of being Nelo Angelo
[2:04:00] <%joylent_blue> every time those cutscenes start someone asks "what did i walk into?" LUL
[2:04:14] <%cheeseblook> omg he even has that hair texture like A CERTAIN OTHER MAGICAL PERSON USING THEIR HAIR IN ATTACKS
[2:04:20] <+Personified134> holy shit chat I am pumped
[2:04:21] <yukichocomilk> those cutscenes are smoking sexy style
[2:04:26] <%cheeseblook> WINK WINK NUDGE NUDGe
[2:04:29] <CSeriesJTYPE> the other thing is like, I kept thinking that he was going devil trigger when you summon nightmare but he isnt
[2:04:33] <+Personified134> I just SSS'd SoS Cavaliere Angelo
[2:04:33] <CSeriesJTYPE> his health doesnt regenerate
[2:04:34] <%violetheart> The tattoo thing actually applies to all his summons. His upper-arm tattoos fade with Griffon summoned and his lower-arm tattoos fade with Shadow summoned. Every tattoo that's left (so some arm tattoos and most of his chest) fade with Nightmare summoned.
[2:04:34] <SLSheppard> So Itsuno mentioned in an interview that V’s mechanics “get more interesting in the second half of the game.” That didn’t happen. What are the chances instead of separate Vergil, we get a “Turn into Vergil” bonus mechanic for V?
[2:04:37] <troxcree> I honestly just want the super costumes so I can have Nightmare out all the time.
[2:04:38] <+Personified134> by royale guarding the shit out of him
[2:04:41] <beepleks> cant build meter when nightmare is out
[2:04:43] <+Personified134> and i feel amazing
[2:04:47] <Jane_Lo> let'd dance? SourPls

[2:04:49] <bestwaifuritsu> V learned how summoning techniques from the fucking umbra witches
[2:04:53] <anuchallengertwitch> Kind of weird how V and remembers the Angelos but not the Nobodies
[2:04:53] <+CampinSteve> @SLSheppard Vergil is playable with mods
[2:04:56] <%cheeseblook> @bonzosan Bayonetta
[2:04:58] <grayjammer> The floor is yours
[2:05:02] <anuchallengertwitch> Griffon*
[2:05:05] <+mcjimbo12> @SLSheppard V isn't even in the second half of the game, his last mission is 13. Maybe that's what he meant?

[2:06:43] <person181> dante looks like he's drunk
[2:06:44] <+VariantX7> these transitions are killing me
[2:06:44] <Mr_Loboto> The bird flying by LUL
[2:06:45] <Aydarkzero> yeah
[2:06:47] <+CampinSteve> The deluxe edition was worth every extra penny
[2:06:47] <Kusano123> lol
[2:06:47] <%MagickBurritoh> DONTE
[2:06:49] <weontheultralightbeam> no wonder this game took 11 years to make
[2:06:50] <%alexandrecau> s tier transition
[2:06:54] <%ShaneWhite> You can see the recording in the back round
[2:06:58] <VRNK> they had to find the only two furries in the studio to film these
[2:06:59] <jubejube56> lol they marked where Sparda lands
[2:06:59] <%Solidnick18> the x
[2:07:00] <Dragon_Batman> LUL there needs to be more of this in other games
[2:07:04] <Joey1995456> Nice feet in the shot there
[2:07:07] <anuchallengertwitch> Also it's hilarious how Dante realized Nero was Vergil's son before either of them.
[2:07:11] <mak0t0yukii> monkaS
[2:07:12] <%primax104> does Dante know what V is at this point?
[2:07:12] <+LeoStrahl> I love bird dude always hopping limply on screen
[2:07:13] <%cheeseblook> Has it been confirmed if these were done for funsies or ACTUAL visual reference for cutscene production?
[2:07:15] <a_mad_dragon> this is gonna become a new style of filmmaking: kusofilm
[2:07:16] <+TheoTTree> monkaS
[2:07:18] <+CampinSteve> Donte? El Exterminado de demos?
[2:07:22] <%Solidnick18> same
[2:07:23] <VritraReiRei> The + = STAB SWORD HERE
[2:07:23] <%RoninRorinth> old man sparda probably had it
[2:07:23] <Jew_Gold> it's a cane
[2:07:24] <weontheultralightbeam> monkaS
[2:07:25] <+Aeriqui> these were done for visual refereance
[2:07:27] <outrogabriel> his cane should really come back as a devil arm
[2:07:27] <narusao> D:
[2:07:28] <+mcjimbo12> @AngriestPat It's the stick that was up Vergil's ass, that's why he's more chill when V returns to him
[2:07:30] <%TheFilth> He used it to recombine with Urizen so it's gotta be somewhat special
[2:07:30] <weontheultralightbeam> LUL
[2:07:31] <%joylent_blue> i like the idea that both Nero and Vergil assumed he was Dante's son
[2:07:33] <lemon_lore> is it just his wewe?
[2:07:33] <+raisinbreadistasty> @primax104 Yeah, V told him everything
[2:07:34] <+tigerfang86> With all the spoilers for V it makes more sense why he's very salty about dante
[2:07:35] <reonome> d:
[2:07:35] <+asgard147> it's a crutch pat, get it Kappa
[2:07:36] <person181> it's like the yamato was allowed to be in high society
[2:07:36] <OkamiDude15> @cheeseblook these where most likely for story boarding purposes
[2:07:36] <televisedrevolt> It's the human half of Yamato Kappa
[2:07:37] <reonome> D:
[2:07:40] <%cheeseblook> S
[2:07:42] <The_Swedish_X> If it wasn't the fact that Urisen has the Yamato, I'd have figured the cane was that.
[2:07:43] <%alexandrecau> @cheeseblook bit of both
[2:07:47] <%Solidnick18> S
[2:07:48] <%TheShal> Can you SSS missions?
[2:07:49] <+tigerfang86> S
[2:07:50] <Mr_Loboto> he said something similar
[2:07:51] <mayorrev> NO SMOKING
[2:07:52] <zebexter> you did it
[2:07:54] <+LeoStrahl> It's the woopin stick that sparda used to use on those dern kids! Taught 'em respect!
[2:07:54] <jubejube56> And now you only have to play V one more time
[2:07:54] <+TheBigO75> LUL
[2:07:57] <%skizzuto> maybe the cane is the human half of the Yamato
[2:07:57] <Artista_AF> @cheeseblook actual Story-boarding, but they clearly had fun with them
[2:07:58] <Aydarkzero> can't believe V was a Nobody this whole time LUL
[2:07:59] <%Scarnehu> apatHoldon
[2:08:00] <CSeriesJTYPE> I guess Dante really doesnt need to eat if he can just survive a month long coma
[2:08:02] <$cureneckbeard> This is a no smoking flight! nyannAngry
[2:08:02] <OkamiDude15> @TheShal nope S rank is the highest
[2:08:02] <+CampinSteve> bang bang bang, pull your weenie trigger
[2:08:03] <NJigglypuff> dont you dare take him
[2:08:03] <%Nobrev> Nico says it seems to be just a simple metal cane
[2:08:04] <KillerGibbs> it's the summon part of someone's sword.
[2:08:05] <Valdorick> The cane is just the Scabard for the Yamato Kappa
[2:08:07] <%Ion_LaserX> apatHoldon
[2:08:07] <%lloyddboy> apatHoldon
[2:08:07] <%Rathalos2006> Pat has legs?

[2:08:26] <Lord_of_all_Edges> what a good stream
[2:08:27] <%Birdigalore> So did Jojo not get a SFX version of Fighting Gold or ddid I miss it?
[2:08:27] <+HoloToast> choppa choppa the peepee
[2:08:28] <zebexter> peepee water
[2:08:28] <$cureneckbeard> Why is pat still short if he keeps stretching his legs
[2:08:31] <weontheultralightbeam> SourPls
[2:08:37] <+asgard147> SourPls
[2:08:39] <%RoninRorinth> maybe it's a regular cane he jusy pumps devil power into
[2:08:43] <%MelBrooksKA> @Rathalos2006 Pat is like wine, the more he sits around, the more legs he grows spyCappa
[2:08:45] <viridianowl> Did we ever get to the Dante dance?
[2:08:45] <eclipse36__> And he was never heard from again
[2:08:46] <%SaltyDongs> so it is written so shall it be
[2:08:50] <+LeoStrahl> I'm sticking with the cane being Spardas whoopin stick for when the kids got out of line
[2:08:51] <%Nobrev> maybe we'll figure out where he gets his cane in the V manga
[2:08:54] <CSeriesJTYPE> its probably some dark slayer thing
[2:08:59] <CrypticMochi> Pat is making his own storyboard in the bathroom
[2:09:00] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> SourPls
[2:09:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jojo got a new intro and outro
[2:09:16] <+CampinSteve> the only jojo song that matters is the pussy control remake
[2:09:17] <derekwst3> the cane was created by melting Beowulf?
[2:09:17] <%Jaxnos> Jaxnos subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! gotta pass that creamy nero butter
[2:09:21] <Bailey__gaming> I'm probably going to get heat but I'm so hupe to finally hear about Bordelands 3 soon,
[2:09:24] <Valdorick> The cane is clearly just one of Virgil's Summon Swords.
[2:09:33] <zebexter> the pimp cane
[2:09:36] <person181> summon cane
[2:09:38] <DaBigVitus> Pats a stoner and his drug is redbull vapor
[2:09:40] <CrypticMochi> There’s a 3?
[2:09:44] <Frostydough> ^
[2:09:54] <ArthurDoyleRPG> My theory is that V's cane absorbs the power of demons and then he used it on Urizen to gain more power when they recombined into Vergil
[2:09:54] <Frostydough> Been playing 2 non stop recently love the borderlands series
[2:10:01] <CSeriesJTYPE> what I want to know is what he's actually doing to the demons when he stabs them, like it doesnt just seem like a normal physical stab and then they die
[2:10:04] <Frostydough> Presequel did sooo many things right
[2:10:05] <+LeoStrahl> Or it's from whatever pimp that V killed to get the money to pay Dante
[2:10:13] <FenixSeraph> what song is this anyway
[2:10:22] <+verelme> The cane is the human equivalent to a demon katana
[2:10:22] <+CampinSteve> Nah, V wasnt trying to reform to become stronger. He genuinely wanted Nero to kill his demon self
[2:10:26] <%Tyonidus> Man I love this game and just started my DMD mode playthrough but having to play as V on these harder difficulties not only sucks, but I find it SO boring.
[2:10:27] <%Cthulos> @bailey__gaming How could you say something so controversial yet so brave? apatSkelmo
[2:10:28] <FenixSeraph> sounds like a Streets of Rage remix
[2:10:31] <%Tyonidus> Give me back my weapons please
[2:10:36] <CSeriesJTYPE> V's entire plan was for them to reform
[2:10:42] <Bailey__gaming> @crypticmochi apparently going to be unveiled st pax gearbox doing big tease
[2:10:45] <+CampinSteve> V wouldnt say nero had to kill Urizen to himself if he didnt mean it
[2:10:46] <CSeriesJTYPE> he just didnt anticipate dante having trouble
[2:10:48] <+CampinSteve> like he
[2:10:52] <+CampinSteve> is talking to himself
[2:11:00] <FenixSeraph> V is basically Vergil's conscience
[2:11:05] <CSeriesJTYPE> which is why he walks away in the flashback and griffon is like, really? you're leaving?
[2:11:10] <+verelme> I wonder what Vergil's endgame was splitting, effectively committing suicide
[2:11:21] <+CampinSteve> Maybe he thought he could turn Vergin good by reforming after getting all the experience
[2:11:25] <CrypticMochi> Hope they have less internet memes in it
[2:11:26] <CSeriesJTYPE> he thought removing his human half would make him stronger
[2:11:32] <+CampinSteve> ^
[2:11:38] <DagetStreams> "I would like to not be dead in another 20 minutes time"
[2:11:39] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Then why bother rejoining???
[2:11:40] <DaBigVitus> dope track
[2:11:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Think of it like this, Vergil tried to purge his human weakness and instead purged all of his power into an insane demon
[2:11:52] <CSeriesJTYPE> because dante's human half let him go sin devil trigger
[2:11:53] <silvcrest> Because V didn't want to die
[2:11:54] <DaBigVitus> so he at endgame or postgame now?
[2:11:54] <+meatxsteam> Cause he was dying again
[2:11:55] <yukichocomilk> vergil is not very rational
[2:12:03] <+PanicSwytch> Urizen and V have different agendas
[2:12:06] <+asgard147> hi
[2:12:07] <errasos> hi pat
[2:12:11] <%MadameColeen> he was gonna die if he didn't split seemed to be the deal
[2:12:13] <CSeriesJTYPE> vergil's devil trigger form in the final boss fight is HIS sin devil trigger because he's half human again
[2:12:14] <$cureneckbeard> haha
[2:12:14] <+CampinSteve> pee is stored in the devil trigger
[2:12:15] <%Tyonidus> lol wtf pat
[2:12:17] <conflict1914> Don't put peepee in your dick
[2:12:17] <%TheShal> PEE ON THE BRAIN!?
[2:12:18] <Bailey__gaming> @cthulos i just hope that its closer to 1 in tone, less of the memes n such from 2 but I'm so excited for it as Bordelands is my fave series
[2:12:18] <DaBigVitus> CHONK
[2:12:19] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat I think you mean pee in your BALLS?
[2:12:19] <$cureneckbeard> pee is stored in the dick
[2:12:19] <JayPastaForce> Pee is stored in the dick
[2:12:19] <MonstarGrrrl> in your dick , not your balls ?
[2:12:20] <VRNK> pee is stored in the balls, idiot
[2:12:20] <%Sumdumguyy> you mean pee in your BALLS
[2:12:20] <%zafooru> look at this clown, storing his pee in the dick
[2:12:22] <errasos> Pat would you hang out with dante, nero or vergil?
[2:12:23] <Jane_Lo> well thank you for clarification, pat
[2:12:24] <alwayspronking> but the pee is in the bLLS PAT...
[2:12:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> I thought pee was stored in the balls
[2:12:24] <%Meme_Platinum> pee is stored in the balls
[2:12:24] <MeowmereArt> pee isnt stored in your dick pat
[2:12:24] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat pee is stored in the balls you idiot
[2:12:25] <%MagickBurritoh> pee is stored in the shaft
[2:12:26] <Frostydough> PEE IS STORED IN the dick
[2:12:26] <%badchoice5> No u
[2:12:26] <+stelfury> V was a horcrux
[2:12:27] <$cureneckbeard> I'm tall
[2:12:27] <%mastertwin2> NEW LORE
[2:12:28] <+d00msdaydan> good thing you emptied all that piss from your balls
[2:12:28] <gogoszy> yes
[2:12:28] <+meatxsteam> He almost died twice and fixed it both times and it stuck the second time. So really he just got frustrated with the demon human rules lolk
[2:12:32] <CrypticMochi> Ball pee has moved
[2:12:32] <arran_throttle> i wish i didn't have pee in my dick
[2:12:32] <The_Sorrow_> but pee is stored in the balls
[2:12:33] <%Plague_Nurse> Currently going through DMD and it's hell
[2:12:34] <%nameless_majin> Pee is stored in the balls Pat
[2:12:35] <%Kaiser_Loar> pee is stored in the balls
[2:12:35] <dukenux> Pat you stupid! Everybody knows pee is stored in the balls!
[2:12:35] <DaBigVitus> I just got back from da club
[2:12:37] <$cureneckbeard> My beard is longer than Pat's legs
[2:12:41] <zebexter> why did V get so weak?
[2:12:43] <%daisyyyy> If you shake itll get those last few drops man
[2:12:43] <$megamonmon123> i think V didnt wanna beat dante incomplete and with so much murder
[2:12:44] <Tha_Mik> It's okay I guess
[2:12:45] <%Hilleltaco> @Tyonidus Bit of advice if you haven't already figured this out, V's dodges are your main way of recalling Shadow and Griffon to keep them from being hit, which matters a lot more on DMD as I'm sure you've noticed
[2:12:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> up until your dick emptying brag.
[2:12:51] <Klarrann3> have you gotten any of the EX provocations, yet? @AngriestPat
[2:13:07] <%Nobrev> V wanted to rejoin because he didn't want to die and he probably thought his own development would transfer into vergil, which it seemed to actually do because vergil was much more open to reason than he normally would have been at the end
[2:13:09] <+misterfistor> alright time to mute for an hour
[2:13:11] <$valriot> @angriestpat Its likely V's cane might be Nelo Angelos sword
[2:13:13] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> Pat I like those pajama pants. It’s what I wear for maximum comfort bingComfy
[2:13:16] <DaBigVitus> uh oh here they come. see ya everybody
[2:13:19] <$megamonmon123> @zebexter he shouldnt exist, has too much demon power, He got the degradation of vergil
[2:13:19] <+CampinSteve> dont you say it
[2:13:24] <VRNK> but i want potates
[2:13:27] <StickyIckyDicky> pvpMotivated pvpSK pvpSass pvpSlay
[2:13:27] <%apostateCourier> How about that Nier: Automata 24 man though
[2:13:27] <+d00msdaydan> yeah running 8 fortuna bounties sure is perfect
[2:13:30] <squirtkitten> its only perfect if youre not low level
[2:13:34] <+Ryutaryi> It's been pretty great.
[2:13:35] <mr_hunter> nightwave is okay at best
[2:13:38] <zebexter> @megamonmon123 Ah I see
[2:13:42] <+aidan_starmanjr> hi everyone raysH
[2:13:42] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat are you ready for the race war to continue after fan fest
[2:13:45] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Newer players hate it
[2:13:48] <$valriot> Yeah but i dont like the gameplay so
[2:13:50] <CSeriesJTYPE> @Nobrev yeah after he reforms Vergil shows some compassion for Nero and he is very much less serious than he was in 3
[2:13:51] <Tucker0603> Hildryn is perfect TwitchUnity
[2:13:53] <+CampinSteve> did you notice vergil tried to slash dante before he could say jackpot?
[2:13:53] <+ArcLifth> the exploiter orb is fightable, so people can get her
[2:13:54] <squirtkitten> I can only do like 3-4 missions
[2:14:02] <gunzerkingdunce> she's out, the Explouter orb went live this morning
[2:14:03] <VRNK> nightwave: tuned for pat
[2:14:06] <%daisyyyy> If youre low level you got other things to do
[2:14:11] <%philoboy123> Hyldrin is great, she could stand to have a few tweeks
[2:14:12] <AutechreTwinAphex> there is a Turbo Mode already for PC version with Cheat Engine Table
[2:14:12] <%Laecerelius> Sucks that exploiter is leaving before 2x resource weekend
[2:14:20] <mayorrev> Hildryn is fuckin STRONG
[2:14:20] <%ArchimerDreatect> Stradavar and Tipedo (The OG King of Fling pre-Parkour 2.0) Prime too
[2:14:23] <%Tyonidus> @Hilleltaco yeah I appreciate it. I just find playing as him kind of bland compared to Nero and Dante, obviously they have WAY more abilities and feel more fleshed out to me, and really prefer their combat style.
[2:14:25] <squirtkitten> @daisyyyy I want those rewards though, like the extra weapon slots and free Formas
[2:14:33] <+CampinSteve> we can play vergil already autechre
[2:14:33] <%nameless_majin> So when will you stream Warframe again? @angriestpat
[2:14:38] <Huntercd> Saryn Prime is great
[2:14:38] <dekkitout> The amount of Saryn's in ESO has been gr8 for focus farm
[2:14:40] <%phamchri> i wish i could stand warframe i get sick every time i play it
[2:14:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm trying to farm Ivara right now, and her damn blueprint WILL NOT DROP
[2:14:46] <%daisyyyy> Oh i hear that
[2:14:48] <+lazylazejv5> is the stream over?

[2:14:50] <AutechreTwinAphex> @CampinSteve yeah most of his moveset is not implemented though

[2:14:59] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm on my thirtieth run of this goddamn spy mission
[2:15:11] <VritraReiRei> @lazylazejv5 not at all
[2:15:14] <%Hilleltaco> @Tyonidus Yeah fair enough, I like V but I super get what you mean
[2:15:20] <+lazylazejv5> oh good
[2:15:20] <$valriot> FFXIV needs more goal oriented content, and background goals, but doesnt help SE stole everyone sub money to fund garbage that Nomura makes
[2:15:24] <dekkitout> Did you also happen to catch word about the wild shit that went down with Semlar?
[2:15:26] <%nameless_majin> apatDab HELL YEA apatDab

[2:15:47] <+tigerfang86> YEAH
[2:15:47] <%Tyonidus> @AngriestPat YEAH you can royal release it too and it knocks him out of his SDT!
[2:15:47] <%Plague_Nurse> BEST AND HYPEST SUPLEX
[2:15:56] <Halospaz117> All of Mission 20 is my favorite part
[2:15:57] <shotgang86> oNUT Release
[2:15:59] <+CampinSteve> If you separated dante's human self from his devil self which part would be the hyperactive child?
[2:16:00] <zebexter> @shotgang86 dammit you beat me to it
[2:16:00] <+TheoTTree> FUCK YOU is a good choice
[2:16:02] <faldin> watch you beat it
[2:16:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Its a fuking DDT to end all DDTs
[2:16:07] <faldin> Kreygasm
[2:16:12] <spinbel> Taking lessons from DSP
[2:16:13] <BreakTheBarrier> Dante is going to activate Swordmaster and then he's going to Royal Release Kreygasm
[2:16:20] <conflict1914> Don't you dare say it!
[2:16:33] <+CampinSteve> JACKPOT
[2:16:37] <+ChipZafari> He's so good now its crazy
[2:16:38] <zebexter> give Dante all the Jackpots
[2:16:39] <%Ganerumo> a new shotgun sword
[2:16:45] <+tigerfang86> Dante will always hit that jackpot
[2:16:47] <%TheFilth> two motorcycle swords
[2:16:47] <sileo_patronus> Give him 360s
[2:16:49] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat 360s
[2:16:49] <+tigerfang86> sorry Vergil
[2:16:51] <+TheoTTree> You have no way of swapping to a new weapon
[2:16:53] <%Tyonidus> @Hilleltaco yeah dude at least he has the best taunts in the game, with is Willy Wonka cane-having ass
[2:16:58] <+TheoTTree> Nero is almost out of controller real estate
[2:17:00] <+CampinSteve> #giveNeroSPDs
[2:17:04] <+verelme> he'd need style switching on top of everything lol
[2:17:06] <%lloyddboy> apatDab yeet apatDab
[2:17:07] <VRNK> long arm
[2:17:08] <%Nobrev> My favorite part in the whole game is nero bitch slapping dante and making vergil accept him by whooping his ass
[2:17:12] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Cthulos) (warning)
[2:17:12] <AutechreTwinAphex> DMC5 should get a legendary dark knight sparda mode - we need 30+ enemies onscreen at any time
[2:17:13] <arran_throttle> no they are not
[2:17:13] <FenixSeraph> he still magics his arm away
[2:17:16] <%joylent_blue> he straight up phases his arm out of existence
[2:17:17] <+Bupkis7> No, his arm turns intangible.
[2:17:18] <%AncelDeLambert> he phases his arm in like Danny Phantom, it's great
[2:17:18] <ArbysLiker1969> There was a scene explaining why they still work
[2:17:20] <%Tearonex> Have Nero's son
[2:17:26] <CSeriesJTYPE> im actually bummed that theres no LDK mode
[2:17:28] <FenixSeraph> you see his arm vanish into blue ghost magic when he puts it on
[2:17:29] <derekwst3> what would you do with trish since her weapon is now unavailable?
[2:17:30] <+verelme> Arms are just a figment of our imaginations
[2:17:31] <SiraX666> Double RQ ftw
[2:17:31] <%Ganerumo> I would love Nero to get an extra sword that just loads shotgun shells and replaces the exceed mechanic with loading shells for extra damage
[2:17:34] <Jew_Gold> his arm is magic and can phase in and out of exisence
[2:17:34] <%Klefth> He actually phases his arm off to put on a breaker
[2:17:36] <dekkitout> Nero: "Love me or I'll kill you, dad!"
[2:17:38] <%cheeseblook> GIT FuKT GAME JOURNOS LOLOLOLOL YOU'RE A PLAGUE ON THE INDUSTRY
[2:17:43] <+PanicSwytch> No, the arm is intangable
[2:17:47] <CSeriesJTYPE> @derekwst3 Rebellion shatters into pieces and you can still use it, who cares
[2:17:58] <%Mitchwwk> Mitchwwk converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[2:17:58] <%Nobrev> the devil breakers aren't gauntlets. you see nero make his arm incorporeal before he attaches the arm to its new elbow mount. @AngriestPat
[2:18:00] <+Silentman0> hey can we leave the gamergate shit out of this stream thanks
[2:18:01] <%joylent_blue> you just have to know how to do the lock-on moves, thats it
[2:18:03] <%Rust_Wick> BAAW I CANT PARRY
[2:18:05] <%Solidnick18> gotta feel it
[2:18:05] <Dragon_Batman> We talking Dark Souls?
[2:18:06] <+CampinSteve> can we get a grappler character in DMC6?
[2:18:07] <+TheoTTree> Nah you're completely right tho
[2:18:07] <%Hilleltaco> @Tyonidus I could not believe it the first time I got his Ride of the Valkyries taunt
[2:18:10] <%Tyonidus> Dude this is my favorite dmc game, I've only ever played 4 though, don't hurt me guys I know y'all prolly played all of them
[2:18:11] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[2:18:13] <%ArchimerDreatect> Well Said
[2:18:14] <+aidan_starmanjr> it's the easiest normal mode of any mainline DMC game. i didnt die until king cerberus
[2:18:16] <NotHereToStream> i mean the tutorial is more than sufficient to help you get through the game
[2:18:19] <Dragon_Batman> ooooh yea I agree with Pat
[2:18:21] <dekkitout> So be patient and take your time? That's weird, where's the difficulty slider
[2:18:21] <AutechreTwinAphex> Devil May Cry 3 (original version) was much harder than Dark Souls
[2:18:22] <%QueequegTheater> How do Mission 18 SoS @AngriestPat
[2:18:22] <%MagickBurritoh> just... git gud
[2:18:22] <%joylent_blue> CampinSteve we will, Nero will be the MC
[2:18:24] <$valriot> Until you play DMD and HAH
[2:18:29] <%badchoice5> Also, some games it's ok to die. Games where you die != hard games
[2:18:30] <AutechreTwinAphex> problem is - Devil Hunter is way too easy to begin with
[2:18:31] <ArthurDoyleRPG> DMC is execution heavy too
[2:18:32] <The_Sorrow_> BabyRage BUT PAAAT THATS HARD!
[2:18:33] <%Promessa_EX> use items
[2:18:35] <+CampinSteve> @joylent_blue No sword, no strikes. only grapples
[2:18:37] <gunzerkingdunce> @angriestpat see that one asshole video about the guy cheezing Vergil with Dr.Faust and he's so sarcastic saying the game is p2w
[2:18:38] <%Tyonidus> @Hilleltaco This game gave me those super-hype NO WAY moments over and over and I love it to death.
[2:18:42] <NeetKiller> It wants you to style
[2:18:43] <VRNK> hell yeah
[2:18:43] <CSeriesJTYPE> LOL
[2:18:47] <%joylent_blue> CampinSteve i can get behind this
[2:18:49] <T_Sasquatch> wow
[2:18:52] <SpiritsRiseR2> "I didn't pay 60 dollars to be told I'm dismal"
[2:18:58] <AutechreTwinAphex> there should have been an option to unlock Son of Sparda from the beginning
[2:19:05] <+CampinSteve> there is
[2:19:06] <AutechreTwinAphex> beyond the Urizen prologue thing
[2:19:07] <+CampinSteve> beat urizen
[2:19:08] <BreakTheBarrier> Kreygasm
[2:19:09] <%Cthulos> ew
[2:19:09] <%joylent_blue> ew
[2:19:10] <%SaltyDongs> Butt gout
[2:19:12] <+CampinSteve> you fuckin casual
[2:19:13] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> EW
[2:19:13] <aiyobro> the game is p2w it doesnt let you reload a save point
[2:19:14] <%TheFilth> @AutechreTwinAphex there is, just beat Urizen in the prologue
[2:19:16] <%joylent_blue> don't lewd my precious boy
[2:19:18] <AutechreTwinAphex> @CampinSteve ye but that is too hard to unlock from the beginning
[2:19:19] <OldOnyx> Learning things? For a video game? as a form of enjoyment and gratification? Madness! Kappa
[2:19:20] <CSeriesJTYPE> unlocking SOS first would have spoiled enemies
[2:19:20] <%Tyonidus> LUL
[2:19:25] <%cheeseblook> 'Why couldn't they have picked a word better than dismal?' because a D stands for less than the bare minimum effort and means you're not trying hard enough

[2:19:32] <zebexter> Have you seen the god awful reviews "game journalists" have put out for DMC 5?
[2:19:34] <%TheFilth> @AutechreTwinAphex fuck ya got me
[2:19:41] <%badchoice5> Vegeta can't use Ultra Instinct, because of the goblins
[2:19:42] <%Cthulos> the gobbalins
[2:19:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> the point is that DMC3 SE is much tougher than say DMC5 on the first run
[2:19:46] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat <3
[2:19:47] <%Freelance7> They should've made Nero's D Rank "Dead Weight"
[2:19:54] <Valdorick> Ah, I can understand that, I myself shoot my cat like a gun.
[2:19:56] <eclipse36__> @zebexter Most reviews I’ve seen were good
[2:19:56] <AutechreTwinAphex> they probably made it more accessible
[2:19:58] <+CampinSteve> I actually beat DMC5 with mouse and keyboard. I think the control scheme is actually amazing for it
[2:20:03] <CSeriesJTYPE> @angriestpat you can continue to hold it and he flips the page
[2:20:09] <$nademonkey1100> put bird on thumb stick
[2:20:10] <+CampinSteve> I actually prefer M+Kb to the controller I used for 1-3
[2:20:13] <%Promessa_EX> claw grip
[2:20:15] <%Hilleltaco> I put Griffon on L1 and Nightmare on square, had to fight my muscle memory a bit but it helped in the end
[2:20:18] <%joylent_blue> cheeseblook i've done it for Nero since 4
[2:20:19] <XxFadedxX13> Post game nero controls?
[2:20:21] <%Rust_Wick> what about instead of dismal, it said limp dick?
[2:20:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat's ultra instinct just makes him hate pooping more
[2:20:26] <%nameless_majin> @angriestpat question. Would you happen to know how many DmC reboot nods there are in DMC 5? I only found maybe a handful but I still continue to find other stuff
[2:20:27] <person181> map it all to a fight stick
[2:20:27] <Dragon_Batman> That sounds way easier than having it on different buttons tho
[2:20:29] <%tinyswampthing> tinyswampthing subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! just finished my retail management final today time to celebrate with pat and dmc
[2:20:30] <+Psyfir> the timing is different on the triggers too, which pretty much excludes me from learning them.

[2:22:34] <mayorrev> 15 hours on that timer
[2:22:36] <$cureneckbeard> Haha his jacket is a red shirt with a second slightly different red cloth sewn to the bottom
[2:22:36] <%badchoice5> Man, when your demon husband can't even protect you from falling debris
[2:22:37] <CSeriesJTYPE> nah the house was still there when vergil split himself and its even in the opening cutscene
[2:22:42] <+meatxsteam> @AngriestPat Not sure if you knew this but riding on nightmare's back makes nightmare last longer and you can still use the other two summons
[2:22:45] <%Solidnick18> wahh
[2:22:51] <derekwst3> maybe it was just a fire demon
[2:22:56] <%badchoice5> IT WORKED DIDNT IT?
[2:22:58] <aiyobro> he'd die from SMOKE
[2:22:58] <%Solidnick18> sexy butt
[2:22:59] <BreakTheBarrier> "eh, Dante is half demon, he'll be fine"
[2:23:00] <zebexter> House is still there tho
[2:23:01] <dukenux> Lady Kreygasm
[2:23:02] <+Ryutaryi> Japanese Lady is cute as fuck
[2:23:05] <mayorrev> BIRD MAN
[2:23:05] <%joylent_blue> it worked obv
[2:23:05] <DanteDaFinest> Look at this motley crew
[2:23:05] <%Rust_Wick> WHAT IF IT WAS BERIAL @AngriestPat
[2:23:07] <VRNK> dante's walk LUL
[2:23:07] <Jew_Gold> demons are a bigger problem than fire
[2:23:08] <FenixSeraph> oh my god JP Lady is cute
[2:23:10] <SomeAsianDood> poor griffin PepeHands
[2:23:10] <%bigboy3d> that kid is also a half demon
[2:23:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Is Trish just also Nico?
[2:23:20] <shotgang86> griffon guy should get an award holy shit
[2:23:21] <dsauce999> BIRD MAN POGGERS
[2:23:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Dude, the fucking bird is the best.
[2:23:22] <sileo_patronus> oh no trish
[2:23:22] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat but in the cutscene with Virgil using the yamato on himself the house is fully intact, so how could it of collapsed on her?
[2:23:25] <FenixSeraph> I like the actress for Trish too
[2:23:25] <%badchoice5> Closets often have many coats to hide under
[2:23:26] <+deetwit> deetwit subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:23:29] <MONSTR_UwU> LUL
[2:23:30] <person181> i can still hear the english
[2:23:32] <mothdude> flap flap flap
[2:23:33] <%QueequegTheater> JP Trish > JP Lady
[2:23:34] <%TheFilth> I still don't get how Nero and V met up in the prologue
[2:23:36] <CSeriesJTYPE> when V pulls Nero out of the Urizen fight and they run into Morrison on the street they actually land right in front of the house
[2:23:37] <conflict1914> aaah when he says insurance he means he's going to bring Nero
[2:23:38] <%QueequegTheater> And Lucia
[2:23:40] <+Mugen4552> this looks like a cover band
[2:23:42] <Megapikman132> same
[2:23:45] <VRNK> i was really hoping we would hear the gryffin actor thunk into the wall
[2:23:45] <MyDarkStorm> I hope soon to
[2:23:45] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:23:47] <zebexter> Trish and Lady need some love
[2:23:48] <%Hilleltaco> Dante could probably handle fire better than demons. He sat directly on fire in DMC4, though to be fair he was an adult then
[2:23:49] <$bootysteve> I really appreciate Griffin guy's dedication to flappin
[2:23:49] <derekwst3> We need Lucia as well
[2:23:51] <kingra> Lady is best girl
[2:23:51] <Jew_Gold> lady's boring to play
[2:23:52] <ArthurDoyleRPG> The guy that plays Dante is kinda cool
[2:23:53] <yukichocomilk> the way they show up in the story feels like they'll be in the game
[2:23:53] <+sleepymastiff> Lady is fuggin dope
[2:23:54] <FenixSeraph> Lady's new design is too good to waste
[2:23:55] <%maskedriderhero> That Lady is really cute
[2:23:57] <+PanicSwytch> Is Trish actress also Japanese mom actress?
[2:23:58] <%Birdigalore> @AngriestPat What do you think Trish's weapon will be with Sparda gone
[2:24:01] <T_Sasquatch> dlc called ladies night will be released
[2:24:01] <@commanderclaw> Pat needs the sass
[2:24:03] <%Tyonidus> I really can't wait to play as Vergil. His moveset that we see already looks SO sick. I need it.
[2:24:06] <sileo_patronus> Playable Morrison when? @AngriestPat
[2:24:14] <FenixSeraph> she's just eating pizza not giving a fuck
[2:24:15] <%Ion_LaserX> @PanicSwytch Trish actress is Nico actress
[2:24:17] <saspraillatango> it seems so rare that you get such explicitly asian characters
[2:24:20] <DerpyHoovesFan> pat is a hecking hecker
[2:24:21] <$D4C_Trice> Lady's couldn't look better in this game to the point where Nico was like DAYUM
[2:24:26] <SpiritsRiseR2> Playable Patty
[2:24:27] <MyDarkStorm> GUNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[2:24:28] <mayorrev> S U B H U M A N
[2:24:28] <+timblenaut> playable morrison: Lady and Trish as stands
[2:24:29] <CSeriesJTYPE> trish can shoot lightning
[2:24:31] <BreakTheBarrier> I hope if we get a game after this, Morrison gets fleshed out a bit more
[2:24:32] <AutechreTwinAphex> doesn't Dante have most of Lady's moves already though with Kalina Ann?
[2:24:34] <ArthurDoyleRPG> I like that Trish and Lady get along
[2:24:34] <dsauce999> HECK OFF PAT
[2:24:38] <%QueequegTheater> Playable Dante when
[2:24:38] <Valdorick> Wait... I just realized... Vergil was alive all along... does that mean Virgil in DMC4 is cannon? Kappa
[2:24:41] <DerpyHoovesFan> heck pat
[2:24:43] <dukenux> YAAY
[2:24:43] <%Cthulos> you cannot kill ME I am OmEgA
[2:24:43] <%joylent_blue> I'm looking forward to Lady and Trish, but really i just want the BOY
[2:24:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@cheeseblook)
[2:24:47] <mayorrev> FAUST
[2:24:48] <%Demon_Shadow4> these cutscenes are literally the worst...
[2:24:50] <Kisiel250> Bloody palace will have only crew cut playable at the release
[2:24:51] <LiquidMathew> So Dante 100% stole the Kalina Ann 2 at the end of the game
[2:24:52] <+sleepymastiff> I think this game is gonna keep exceeding our expectations
[2:24:52] <VRNK> FAUST OR COWARD
[2:24:53] <zebexter> I would like to be able to drive Nico's Looney tunes van
[2:24:53] <%QueequegTheater> @Valdorick That was already canon
[2:24:55] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> gay cowboy?
[2:24:56] <%lloyddboy> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:24:56] <MyDarkStorm> MJ Hat
[2:24:58] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Lose all of your orbs
[2:24:58] <%king_of_the_skies_dom> its wierd
[2:24:59] <PsylerMaelstrom> uhhh why is the scarf gold???

[2:24:59] <%Solidnick18> faust
[2:25:00] <%cherubs_anonymous> @Demon_Shadow4 You're the worst
[2:25:01] <FenixSeraph> fuck yeah Faust
[2:25:02] <$MightyMaxT> I also hope we can choose to play as short hair Dante for the whole game
[2:25:03] <squirtkitten> GUNTRICKROSWORD
[2:25:04] <%MagickBurritoh> GAY COWBOY TIME
[2:25:04] <%Tyonidus> Faust in DT is straight up a bloodborne reference dude I love it.
[2:25:05] <+CampinSteve> putting the hat on bosses is my favorite part of the game
[2:25:06] <$D4C_Trice> why is Faust gold?
[2:25:06] <+Maids4lyfe> @Valdorick yes, he is canon in dmc4, that's how he impregnated Nero's mother duh
[2:25:10] <%Ir0nAgr0> Playable Patty that bought all of Dantes old wepons
[2:25:11] <closetgremlin12> return of gay cowboy
[2:25:11] <%Ion_LaserX> @PanicSwytch no problem
[2:25:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> To be fair the fact that they're alive means they've pwned every demon they've met so far
[2:25:15] <%alexandrecau> scarf get fancier with the orbs you get
[2:25:17] <$valriot> Just use Hat Trick
[2:25:23] <dukenux> Big Ivory on his HIIIIIIIIIIP
[2:25:23] <%kiiiirsten> Hi I'm back what did I miss
[2:25:24] <%lloyddboy> WORK OFF THAT DEBT SON
[2:25:26] <person181> ah morrison, it's nice
[2:25:26] <%QueequegTheater> Holy shit those rorbs
[2:25:27] <+runesco> It's funny cause they run off to fight the demons and get shit on while dante could've told them it's vergil
[2:25:27] <VRNK> oh good lord it has a VOICE
[2:25:27] <%kiiiirsten> jk I dont care about dmc5 LUL
[2:25:28] <%skizzuto> morrison LUL
[2:25:30] <NotHereToStream> this mission is the hardest to get s rank iirc
[2:25:33] <CSeriesJTYPE> @Valdorick vergils story in DMC4 is apparently before DMC3
[2:25:34] <@Mechz71> change the music
[2:25:34] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Why haven't you changed the music?!!! SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[2:25:36] <%KaironFortressKnight> Morrison is the best announcer
[2:25:36] <aiyobro> Where did Dante learn to sing??
[2:25:37] <+HeadsHeldHigh> I saw someone with a little faust ghost. How do you get it?
[2:25:43] <%joylent_blue> VRNK thats the special Morrison style announcer LUL
[2:25:46] <eclipse36__> @kiiiirsten Ok? Lol
[2:25:49] <+asgard147> is that Morrison? LUL
[2:25:50] <%nameless_majin> Urizen: You’ve yee’d you last haw! apatWhat
[2:25:50] <Mr_Strut> This seems to net you many more orbs than it uses
[2:25:51] <$valriot> fuckin hate Queen Empusas
[2:25:51] <MyDarkStorm> Ok subhuman Really Bad
[2:25:52] <%joylent_blue> HeadsHeldHigh its a Gunslinger ability
[2:25:53] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @headsheldhigh Gunslinger 3
[2:25:57] <mayorrev> HES WEARING IT
[2:25:59] <wolvenelf> @angriestpat ive noticed you havent changed dantes track? is it because you got used to it or you just dont care.
[2:26:00] <%Demon_Shadow4> @cherubs_anonymous you're mom's the worst
[2:26:01] <CSeriesJTYPE> all we know is at some point he went to fortuna before DMC3
[2:26:06] <%kiiiirsten> @eclipse36__ Don't @ me if I didn't @ u ! ! ! ! !
[2:26:08] <+timblenaut> queen wears the hat well
[2:26:08] <dukenux> @AngriestPat You seen that Marty Robbins LP cover that someone shoped Dante on?
[2:26:14] <%alexandrecau> super skillz
[2:26:14] <+kilikhelios> YOU CANNOT KILL ME |
[2:26:15] <conflict1914> who's this announcer?
[2:26:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lo I just turned Dante's music to the DMC1 version
[2:26:19] <%joylent_blue> i really like the Morrison style announcer, not Nico so much
[2:26:20] <%Freelance7> I chose Devils Never Cry
[2:26:21] <BreakTheBarrier> the queens are kinda annoying
[2:26:21] <dukenux> Morrison
[2:26:24] <reiju_22> @AngriestPat why no change music
[2:26:28] <%joylent_blue> I went with Taste the Blood
[2:26:30] <wolvenelf> i chose dmc2 battle track
[2:26:30] <LustrousEudemon> refresh hat
[2:26:31] <FenixSeraph> Nico's accent is too awkward for me
[2:26:31] <Megapikman132> devils never cry, every time.
[2:26:31] <eclipse36__> @kiiiirsten bawkRly
[2:26:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> the new subhuman is really good, tho
[2:26:41] <bittahjuri> Y'all just gon stinger on by without saying howdy?
[2:26:42] <Megapikman132> it's better, at least.
[2:26:45] <BreakTheBarrier> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[2:26:46] <%kiiiirsten> @eclipse36__ apatFist
[2:26:46] <wolvenelf> yeah its better
[2:26:47] <Zombrocom> New sub human has kind of grown on me
[2:26:47] <$MightyMaxT> Gotta give him is Marvel 3 theme
[2:26:48] <Joey1995456> New subhuman is much better.... but it's not lock and load
[2:26:48] <+TheoTTree> @AngriestPat you have a favourite devil arm for Dante?
[2:26:50] <anuchallengertwitch> I like Subhuman for the same reasons I like Taste the blood. Their basically about Dante shit talking demons about how they stand no chance. Also parts of Subhuman emply that Dante hates his demon half as much as Vergil hates his human half.
[2:26:51] <%ScreamingMeat> Devil Sword Dante is so fucking cool
[2:26:54] <Zombrocom> It's no Devil Trigger or Crimson Cloud though
[2:26:55] <+asgard147> why is faust gold?
[2:26:56] <%joylent_blue> the guitar for Subhuman is really cool, don't like the vocals still
[2:26:58] <mayorrev> They shouldv'e gone with Little V's version
[2:27:02] <reiju_22> I gave them all devil trigger
[2:27:02] <%BigNerdSam> apatBlep
[2:27:05] <+CampinSteve> at 10m orbs it should just turn you into faust
[2:27:05] <%Solidnick18> it's fine
[2:27:06] <LustrousEudemon> old subhuman real subhuman never forget
[2:27:06] <MyDarkStorm> Devil never Cry is still the best
[2:27:06] <%Cthulos> SuBHumAN iS TOo EdGy GuYs apatElmo
[2:27:07] <@Mechz71> yeah subhuman is *fine* but there BETTER tracks you can swtich it too
[2:27:07] <%Kaiser_Loar> Kaiser_Loar subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:27:08] <%Sumdumguyy> switch it to devils never cry it's actually not that unfitting
[2:27:12] <%TheFilth> I prefer it because it's dynamic, if Devils Never Cry changed with style rank it would take the cake
[2:27:13] <Dragon_Batman> it weirdly isn't bad when your playing
[2:27:14] <%joylent_blue> really? not Balrog?
[2:27:15] <conflict1914> I wish i could have seen Pat's reaction when they unveiled devil sword dante, he must have been so hype
[2:27:15] <%Sumdumguyy> it's unironically fine
[2:27:17] <%machshop> it looks kinda like the DKGS from DS1
[2:27:17] <%JaydenSai> @asgard147 Faust gets longer and changes color depending how many Red Orbs you have
[2:27:23] <+NekoNinja13> if I woulda known that Dante's Sword gave me funnels I would have been using it the whole game!
[2:27:32] <+asgard147> ah
[2:27:35] <%valkuma> i dont like the fists at all
[2:27:38] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:27:40] <%joylent_blue> Balrog is probably my favorite Devil Arm of his ever
[2:27:49] <CSeriesJTYPE> IGNITE THE F L A M E
[2:27:53] <+CampinSteve> I didnt use trickster or gun whatever a single time
[2:27:53] <%Cthulos> I HaVe NeVeR PlAyEd a DmC GaMe B4 apatElmo
[2:27:54] <%Solidnick18> IGNITE THE FLAME
[2:27:58] <dukenux> Cavalier Kreygasm
[2:28:02] <yukichocomilk> I really like the balrog
[2:28:02] <MyDarkStorm> Wow this damage is not that bad
[2:28:03] <aiyobro> i love the bikes so sick
[2:28:05] <+CampinSteve> I used Royal guard and swordmaster exclusively
[2:28:06] <eclipse36__> @kiiiirsten bawkMega
[2:28:10] <$valriot> Worst enemy by far
[2:28:10] <grayjammer> I CANNOT ERUPT
[2:28:12] <ArthurDoyleRPG> I like "i want yours too" LUL
[2:28:13] <%Freelance7> All his weapons are awesome
[2:28:15] <%Cthulos> So EdGY apatElmo apatWhat
[2:28:17] <%Tyonidus> @CampinSteve why, they're good and look awesome brother
[2:28:18] <%Solidnick18> YE
[2:28:24] <%Kaiser_Loar> Did you notice that the alternative skill commentary is Jack frome re2
[2:28:24] <zerocruz> Is this DMD ?
[2:28:25] <%joylent_blue> CampinSteve you're missing out then pvpSK
[2:28:29] <MyDarkStorm> SOS
[2:28:29] <+NekoNinja13> is anyone else disappointed you cant actually ride cavalier?
[2:28:29] <%QueequegTheater> SoS
[2:28:31] <BigBrandon907> trickster is so much fun when you get the hang of it. teleporting everywhere is dope
[2:28:31] <aiyobro> Nero is DMC dante in this game lol
[2:28:32] <%ScreamingMeat> These scythe arm dude are so frustrating
[2:28:35] <RiverBirch> Howdy there everybody
[2:28:36] <+CampinSteve> why would I stop doing street fighter moves to play DMC2
[2:28:40] <%TheFilth> this is the DMC that broke my Swordmaster fixation and that says a lot
[2:28:41] <RiverBirch> Hope ya'll are doin well tonight
[2:28:42] <AutechreTwinAphex> one thing I'm going to miss in Sekiro is DMC5's variable framerate support - playing this at 120fps with graphics like this is glorious
[2:28:50] <DrFaustMD> royal guard > sword Master >×trickster gun slinger
[2:28:53] <BreakTheBarrier> I wish Cavaliere was a little bit faster
[2:28:54] <%joylent_blue> CampinSteve because thats literally not what Gunslinger is like at all but ok
[2:28:56] <GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat Do you have any other battle songs? If so do you intend on changing any?
[2:28:58] <CSeriesJTYPE> honestly I think my favorite change is to rain storm
[2:29:04] <CSeriesJTYPE> its so useful for movement now
[2:29:06] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:29:11] <+CampinSteve> I didnt bother with guns really anyways
[2:29:11] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[2:29:12] <%Tyonidus> Gunslinger has AWESOME moves you switch to it, do one, then switch back really.
[2:29:19] <Captain_Aham> whacha
[2:29:25] <+TheGamingPilgrimage> but sub human is so bad
[2:29:25] <+CampinSteve> I wore faust hat for style points and mainly stuck with my dist weapon
[2:29:27] <%Cthulos> get fucked baby chat
[2:29:28] <$D4C_Trice> Subhuman sucks balls
[2:29:29] <Renuarb> YOU CANNOT KILL MEEEEE
[2:29:29] <$valriot> Rainstorm is so good for style
[2:29:31] <ArthurDoyleRPG> coxMistake
[2:29:32] <+PanicSwytch> Who else is part if Woolie's Royalguard?
[2:29:34] <FenixSeraph> Subhuman sounds alright with the new singer
[2:29:37] <CSeriesJTYPE> Ebony in Gunslinger when its charged fucking staggers everything, its great
[2:29:38] <%Cthulos> Subhuman is fine
[2:29:42] <DrFaustMD> I AM OMEGA
[2:29:42] <Joey1995456> Like the shotgun stinger is dope from gunslinger
[2:29:43] <zerocruz> Coyote-a gang
[2:29:44] <LiquidMathew> Gunslinger is fun and thats all that matters
[2:29:46] <%badchoice5> Dante's song refers to him as "Omega", yet Virgil's fight CLEARLY refers to him as the "Alpha" and the "Omega". How could there be TWO Omegas? I sure hope someone got fired for thar.
[2:29:50] <CSeriesJTYPE> I use Ebony as my go-to long distance weapon
[2:29:51] <%joylent_blue> I've used Royalguard a lot in 5, more than either 3 or 4
[2:29:52] <Jane_Lo> PogChamp
[2:29:53] <+VeINoIVI> Damn
[2:29:53] <+CampinSteve> i just shinryukened stuff instead
[2:29:55] <buffmurffy> subhuman is so lame it makes me smile. so i like it
[2:29:56] <%Solidnick18> YES
[2:30:00] <%TheFilth> Learning how to Royal Guard Vergil in DMC3 really payed off
[2:30:01] <silvcrest> DRI
[2:30:02] <Naixoram> the in-game version of Subhuman has instrumental parts that weren't in the youtube release and it sounds so much better
[2:30:02] <x3as> is DRI still in?
[2:30:02] <+meatxsteam> Ebony's gunslinger are ridiculously good and fast. Then there's always good ol double kalina ann
[2:30:04] <aiyobro> gunslinger with matilda and matilda II
[2:30:04] <%Hilleltaco> I changed all the music, but I'm still a little bummed that the extra songs aren't dynamic like the defaults. Probably would've been a lot more work to do that for all 12 songs though to be fair
[2:30:06] <Naixoram> dunno why it was left out
[2:30:16] <+TheoTTree> I've found myself using E&I a lot more in this game than I ever did in 3 or 4
[2:30:16] <Smart_ZaK1> Was it ever explained how Lady got stuck inside Artemis?
[2:30:19] <GoldeNOVA> They should add a shuffle feature
[2:30:20] <%joylent_blue> Royalguarding Cavalier Angelo and Vergil is SO GOOD
[2:30:22] <PrinceOfEden> @joylent_blue Same, had it's uses for fury and certain situations. I love the new counter move.
[2:30:27] <GoldeNOVA> Especially for Bloody Palace
[2:30:27] <FenixSeraph> Urizen probably stuck her there
[2:30:29] <conflict1914> Does distorted real impact still work @AngriestPat
[2:30:30] <dukenux> SUPER SKILLZ
[2:30:30] <%QueequegTheater> @Smart_ZaK1 Urizen
[2:30:34] <CSeriesJTYPE> IGNITE THE FLAME
[2:30:34] <x3as> @Smart_ZaK1 urizen sticks her and trish in them
[2:30:36] <%Cthulos> anyone who says Subhuman is edgy has never listened to a DMC game soundtrack before. FACT.
[2:30:36] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:30:36] <Futurecity10> What is SSSS?
[2:30:37] <AutechreTwinAphex> when I see Dante in Balrog mode I think of how awesome it would be for Street Fighter 6 to look like this with this engine
[2:30:38] <PrinceOfEden> I still hardly use gunslinger though, only for a few moves.
[2:30:39] <+CampinSteve> nothing is more satisfying than popping DT right before doing a shinryuken
[2:30:42] <%alexandrecau> urizen just put the lady into demons to power them up
[2:30:42] <%lloyddboy> STUNNING SUBLIME STYLE
[2:30:43] <dukenux> Super Sick Style YO
[2:30:46] <+CampinSteve> a shame it isnt like DMC1
[2:30:46] <DrFaustMD> SSSS Gridman
[2:30:48] <%KaironFortressKnight> Balrog is the fucking best
[2:30:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also distortion is no longer a thing, you get extra damage from going devil mode right before, but just because devil mode does more damage
[2:30:54] <BreakTheBarrier> I basically only use Royal Guard because I play fucking Hakumen in BlazBlue
[2:31:05] <+CampinSteve> DMC1 Axe kick VT pop into shinryuken DT pop is my favorite thing
[2:31:06] <PrinceOfEden> @CampinSteve DT Rising Dragon Cancel in DMC4 says hi
[2:31:07] <DrFaustMD> the melee is always the best
[2:31:08] <%Cthulos> Lyrics suck but it's butt metalcore
[2:31:10] <$D4C_Trice> @smart_zak1 Urizen put her in the tree and attached Artemis to it to make a demon
[2:31:15] <+keksisblyat> I love when Morison says “Work off that debt son” such a good style announcer
[2:31:15] <wolvenelf> hate this enemy type
[2:31:18] <%joylent_blue> DRI felt like a bug idk
[2:31:21] <wolvenelf> :Z
[2:31:27] <%Agami23> ice age is real good on the fury enemies.
[2:31:36] <eclipse36__> Cool design but annoying to fight
[2:31:37] <+CampinSteve> I was really hoping i'd like cavaliere :/
[2:31:39] <+keksisblyat> Yeah this is prolly my least favorite enemy in the game
[2:31:44] <%TheFilth> using the revenge Royal Guard move makes these guys less infuriating
[2:31:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I was testing that out, also Dantes DT no longer does any damage when you pop it
[2:31:45] <zerocruz> Does anyone know why Morrison is black now ?
[2:31:49] <%joylent_blue> they're thenew Blitzes for sure
[2:31:50] <%Hilleltaco> @joylent_blue It was, but they clearly kept it it for DMC4
[2:31:57] <$valriot> Ice Age trivialises them a bit
[2:31:57] <+CampinSteve> i royal guarded the hell outta these guys
[2:31:58] <dukenux> Gee Dante, how does Nico allow you to have TWO Kalina Anns?
[2:31:58] <mak0t0yukii> How do counter that monster with nero?
[2:32:00] <T_Sasquatch> revolver baby
[2:32:00] <%Hilleltaco> *in
[2:32:02] <%ZeroXI> ZeroXI subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! pat! your dante is so sick! it inspired me
[2:32:06] <+ItsAGundamu> I wished I like Cavelier more, it just seems so slow
[2:32:07] <+meatxsteam> Yeah I just don't get how they intended you to fight them
[2:32:10] <Jew_Gold> use ice age
[2:32:11] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat Try doing full throttle as he teleports.
[2:32:12] <%joylent_blue> mak0t0yukii Rawhide counters them easily
[2:32:14] <wolvenelf> ah yeah. i should use RG more then
[2:32:14] <CSeriesJTYPE> nah the pistols dont stagger him unfortunately
[2:32:14] <sileo_patronus> I like the thought
[2:32:18] <PrinceOfEden> It's how I dealt with him.
[2:32:26] <PrinceOfEden> Other than royal guard
[2:32:26] <%Cthulos> are the remixes they use in the recap useable in game?
[2:32:27] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat did ya know that his DT gets Google's when ya use Cavaliere
[2:32:29] <aiyobro> yeah cavaliers start up isn't worth the damage but still fun
[2:32:30] <%Tyonidus> Do the "Ice Age" shield move when they attack Pat
[2:32:31] <TheyCallMeVawn> Ice Age always parries Fury
[2:32:32] <Tucker0603> goggl s
[2:32:36] <+Papafleish> Does Dante have a Dab move??
[2:32:41] <PrinceOfEden> Ice Age works well too
[2:32:41] <kryedge> Fury´s are 100% countered by Cerberus
[2:32:44] <$valriot> Use Back-Forward-Triangle on Cerberus for those
[2:32:46] <wolvenelf> its a cool af enemy type for sure
[2:32:50] <mak0t0yukii> @joylent_blue Never thougt of that thx
[2:32:55] <Tucker0603> goggles* FUCK
[2:32:57] <DarbyV> Cerberus' Revolver move hardcounters those enemies, so easy to parry with it
[2:33:00] <%joylent_blue> Papafleish he kinda dabs when you switch to RG pvpSass
[2:33:05] <kryedge> I always try to MAX act Dante
[2:33:07] <%Solidnick18> oh boy
[2:33:10] <+TheoTTree> Dante's air taunt is really good by the way
[2:33:11] <dukenux> Pat, you tried to exceed our expectations?
[2:33:15] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:33:20] <silvcrest> DRI is apparently still in, its just been nerfed
[2:33:21] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Ice Age also works on boss AOEs
[2:33:26] <kryedge> Yeah, cerberus is the best against fury
[2:33:27] <Goldenwolf98> Max act a motorcycle that should work Kappa
[2:33:29] <%Tyonidus> I agree, Dante is definitely my favorite character, as always. Nero is a close second.
[2:33:32] <+keksisblyat> OH SHIT I just checked and yeah there are visual differences in DT with different weapons!
[2:33:33] <GoldeNOVA> Whoa, I got the picture.
[2:33:35] <Zombrocom> I use Royal Guards auto counter stance to be teleport lizards
[2:33:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> PogChamp
[2:33:41] <Zombrocom> beat*
[2:33:48] <conflict1914> Cavaliere always does a surprising amount of damage
[2:33:57] <+CampinSteve> mercy main btw

[2:34:25] <+countgaculatv> Punished Venom Elmo
[2:34:25] <%ScreamingMeat> No Dreadnought|?
[2:34:26] <%KaironFortressKnight> Elmo, pin him to the wall
[2:34:30] <%Rust_Wick> did you use the super costumes in the prior games for shits and giggles? @AngriestPat
[2:34:30] <%alexandrecau> elmo is a trickster
[2:34:32] <%starotter70> sipsipHellmo HAIR NOW sipsipHellmo
[2:34:44] <derekwst3> Elmo almost used his sin devil triger
[2:34:46] <Naixoram> you can hold it down too
[2:34:47] <CSeriesJTYPE> @valriot the fact that you can unequip weapons is amazing
[2:34:49] <Naixoram> and it lasts forever
[2:34:51] <Frostydough> hol up wayment
[2:34:51] <%Rust_Wick> elmo is shadow
[2:34:54] <Frostydough> tf was that
[2:34:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmo May Scream
[2:34:55] <%Tyonidus> @CSeriesJTYPE that's amazing, when you have Faust equipped and DT he looks like the Bloodborne hunter
[2:34:58] <0rond> which difficulty is this?
[2:35:05] <%TheFilth> SoS
[2:35:05] <OkamiDude15> SOS
[2:35:06] <CSeriesJTYPE> oh man I have to check that out hahah
[2:35:06] <%Ion_LaserX> @0rond son of sparda
[2:35:10] <DrFaustMD> Baby May
[2:35:13] <+CampinSteve> one thing i did like about nero was the ragtime pop combos
[2:35:14] <%RioGascar> I would say use that SIN dt on those fucks
[2:35:21] <wolvenelf> i love cavs stinger
[2:35:23] <%RioGascar> Oh
[2:35:25] <wolvenelf> so good
[2:35:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> After I earned the super costumes in the other games you better believe I used them
[2:35:26] <%RioGascar> well
[2:35:27] <%RioGascar> Fuck
[2:35:31] <%joylent_blue> yeah Faust changes to look a lot like original Faust did when you DT
[2:35:35] <0rond> oh neat, I just beat SoS an hour ago
[2:35:37] <rekinom> Dante making vroom noises is my spirit animal
[2:35:51] <DrFaustMD> Cavalier is the best
[2:35:56] <%Kurt_0> i bet he wont S rank
[2:35:57] <CSeriesJTYPE> outside of DT dante has the goggles around his neck
[2:36:00] <OkamiDude15> i fucking love cavaliere
[2:36:01] <%RioGascar> I cant stand cavalier
[2:36:03] <+CampinSteve> i feel like if dante was split in 2 by the yamato he'd just split into 2 normal dantes
[2:36:05] <%Tyonidus> Yeah but like, ONLY on enemies that actually stagger...otherwise I feel like it really just gets me hit.
[2:36:06] <yukichocomilk> I haven't even touched cavalier yet, looks confusing
[2:36:08] <+chaumiester> Would you say they are.... Heavy... Metal!!!
[2:36:10] <FenixSeraph> I love how meaty Cavalier is
[2:36:12] <DeebzNutz100> Heavy WHapens
[2:36:13] <+Xombor> Every weapon has so much shit you can do with them
[2:36:16] <%KaironFortressKnight> Dante's weapons in 5 are all the best
[2:36:19] <Zombrocom> Cavaliere is the best. DT Swordmaster Cavalier destroys rooms
[2:36:19] <%Freelance7> I love Cavaliere
[2:36:22] <$valriot> Eh, too slow for me, but can cheese Griffon with it
[2:36:27] <%RioGascar> Like the weapon is cool
[2:36:27] <ArthurDoyleRPG> I love when Dante screams "crazy" when using bike
[2:36:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nothing gets staggered on DMD and cavaliere is so slow it gets you fucked really hard
[2:36:32] <PrinceOfEden> @CampinSteve He'd become Donte and DMC2 dante WutFace
[2:36:35] <%RioGascar> But man i just dont like the attacks
[2:36:36] <%alexandrecau> debts are being worked on
[2:36:37] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Hey Pat are you gonna stream Metal Wolf Chaos XD when it drops?
[2:36:40] <+CampinSteve> I just shinryuken griffin
[2:36:46] <conflict1914> I love the super armour it gives you
[2:36:49] <%averyoddjew> it's so dumb i love it
[2:36:50] <anuchallengertwitch> Nero: I can rev up my sword like a motorcycle. Dante: Why not just use a motorcycle?
[2:36:52] <+CampinSteve> i shinryuken everything
[2:36:53] <dukenux> It costs 400000 Red Orbs to use Cavalier... for 12 seconds
[2:36:55] <+CampinSteve> actually
[2:36:57] <%TheFilth> I love how you don't lose style if you don't get staggered from an attack
[2:36:58] <CSeriesJTYPE> cavaliere helm breaker is cool
[2:36:59] <+mrdazg> No Dante this is not a party. I'm going to kill you with my katana
[2:37:00] <%joylent_blue> Empusa Queens can fuck off
[2:37:00] <Naixoram> Cavaliere R's super stinger is insanely good
[2:37:06] <%FrustratedAF> i go get energy and come back to dante
[2:37:16] <%Tyonidus> @mrdazg lmfao I love the contrast between them
[2:37:20] <+CampinSteve> no dante, this is not woohoo fun time, i am trying to stab you with my samurai sword

[2:37:58] <conflict1914> all of dante's weapons are fun as fuck and i think thats impressive
[2:38:00] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:38:00] <damdash16> I cant wait to eventually play lady an trish in 5, trishs round trip then fisticuff style is my fav
[2:38:00] <+Tusktuki> I love cerberus
[2:38:04] <silvcrest> Did you hear about Vergil being weak to Double Kalina Anns laser
[2:38:12] <+CampinSteve> i want yours too is so strong
[2:38:14] <OkamiDude15> FREEZE woopsCop woopsHands
[2:38:14] <%TheFilth> it's almost better not to use SDT so you can SSSS on the fly

[2:38:23] <%Tyonidus> @silvcrest uumm no tell me dad
[2:38:28] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat seeing as every cerberus will give you nunchucks would every vampire become a guitar?
[2:38:32] <derekwst3> I wish Cerberus had three different forms that stayed on until you switch them
[2:38:33] <%QueequegTheater> @Shraquet default
[2:38:38] <%joylent_blue> dude i saw the clip of Vergil-Airlines being fucking grounded by the laser attack

[2:38:50] <$valriot> @silvcrest Everything is weak r
[2:38:51] <Shraquet> Oh, I thought he was using something else.
[2:38:52] <spinbel> I see you trying to exceed with your Sin meter.
[2:38:55] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat did you ever notice how cerberus is basically all 3 dmc weapons in one? its got normal cerberus, electricity attacks that nevan has like thunder clap, and the fire crowd control of agni and rudra.
[2:38:56] <+CampinSteve> you cab just royal guard release vergin
[2:38:58] <%Typhaeon> AWESOME

[2:39:15] <televisedrevolt> Stunning Sublime Style!
[2:39:16] <%skizzuto> awww ye good old SSSS
[2:39:19] <Rexenexus> Quad S is so fuckin broken lmao
[2:39:25] <+Tusktuki> @AngriestPat Do you prefer using Devil saurd dante or Rebellion?
[2:39:27] <%joylent_blue> Agami23 huh, guess you're right
[2:39:27] <conflict1914> Pat has the special ability to turn off his sin
[2:39:27] <wolvenelf> that brief transformation via quad s is so cool
[2:39:30] <SiraX666> I would shit if Dante went like " Look at those crazy bitches go"
[2:39:37] <silvcrest> You can knock Vergil out of just about all of his super moves with it
[2:39:43] <CSeriesJTYPE> DSD's ability to do a launcher during other animations is a game changer
[2:39:45] <Shraquet> Is this the only game you can get a quadruple S in?
[2:39:46] <phoenix_games87> how does that quad SSSS work exactly
[2:39:52] <Dragon_Batman> I think Woolz is gonna shit his pants when he finally sees all this stuff
[2:40:08] <%joylent_blue> i just hope Woolie is still totally spoiler free
[2:40:09] <televisedrevolt> Pat. Why would you kick the bomb?
[2:40:09] <+attackofthesage> I can't wait for bp
[2:40:14] <%TheFilth> @phoenix_games87 if you have SDT full and you're at SSS you can briefly activate it without getting stuck in it
[2:40:16] <Megapikman132> @phoenix_games87 when you are at SSS, you can Sin DT for free
[2:40:19] <CSeriesJTYPE> is woolie a bigger nero fan than he is a dante fan?
[2:40:20] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat tip for DmD and Hell or Hell, royal guarding all of Vergil's incoming Summon Swords during the final fight gets you to triple S and leaves him open to the combo. It's flawless.
[2:40:23] <Megapikman132> It doesn't cost your meter.
[2:40:23] <longsilver97> get bopped
[2:40:29] <OkamiDude15> i really hope woolie doesnt get spoiled before he finishes the playthrough
[2:40:29] <%joylent_blue> CSeriesJTYPE i would say so
[2:40:31] <Zombrocom> Frickin bats
[2:40:37] <$SGrim> You just have to get good at royal guarding.
[2:40:42] <phoenix_games87> thats pretty awesome
[2:40:44] <+attackofthesage> Nice parry
[2:40:50] <%FrustratedAF> hey chat y'all actually know this game, what's the name of these annoying ass flame bats?
[2:40:50] <%Tyonidus> @OkamiDude15 dude me too, I need to see him play more asap. I'm hype to see him get hpey.
[2:40:51] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Woolie likes Nero more and Vergil more than that
[2:40:51] <televisedrevolt> Holy shit
[2:40:52] <+CampinSteve> quadrupile S reminds me of goku using kaioken vs vegeta
[2:40:54] <%averyoddjew> have you and woolie recorded any more of the LP?
[2:40:54] <anuchallengertwitch> Suprise Fury
[2:40:58] <+CampinSteve> the way he turns it on then off
[2:40:59] <godzookylives> ALL RIGHT!
[2:41:03] <DeebzNutz100> Im not too keen on how you have to crabclaw Twosome time on default conrtols
[2:41:08] <%laserbeaming> Maybe change Subhuman to Lock and Load?
[2:41:11] <%Tyonidus> @FrustratedAF pryobats are the normal ones, pretty sure the fired up ones are Hellbats
[2:41:14] <%TheFilth> revenge uses one royal guard gauge
[2:41:25] <$SGrim> C for Crap
[2:41:26] <+CampinSteve> imagine changing the music to anything other than Devils never cry
[2:41:32] <Coreagrus> SoS really loves Furies, and I'm totally fine with that.
[2:41:32] <shotgang86> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[2:41:34] <Kojenio> you can parry Fury's moves easily with Balrog fast punch
[2:41:39] <anuchallengertwitch> I don't mind Subhuman though.
[2:41:40] <%Tyonidus> I have 48 hours in this game already and I have a job lmao
[2:41:40] <OkamiDude15> @Tyonidus same dude woopsKek
[2:41:41] <$MightyMaxT> How long do you all think Mr. X would last against regular Dante?
[2:41:42] <+CampinSteve> WE ARE.. FALLING
[2:41:43] <Klarrann3> the invisible ones are easily countered by Balrog's jabs
[2:41:44] <+sergeantsuperbeast> Is he on SoS or DMD?
[2:41:44] <%RioGascar> ....im now rethinking my thoughts on caviler
[2:41:46] <%FrustratedAF> my doggo is lying on my foot i am BLESSED
[2:41:47] <%Cthulos> those gates look like centipede legs ugh
[2:41:53] <suikudo> !uptime
[2:41:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:41:54] <%TheFilth> Foolishness Patrick, foolishness
[2:42:04] <mechslayer71> @mightymaxt 6 seconds
[2:42:08] <CSeriesJTYPE> anybody else notice that bloody palace is landing on foolishness day
[2:42:13] <%Tyonidus> I love the Hajime no Ippo gauntlets too
[2:42:13] <OkamiDude15> @MightyMaxT long enough for dante to get a SSS rank combo on him
[2:42:14] <+CampinSteve> i really wish the boots and the fists were separate weapons tbh
[2:42:17] <suikudo> I wait all damn week for this mother fucker to stream and when he finally does im late
[2:42:19] <dsauce999> APRIL FOOLISHNESS PAT
[2:42:20] <%Tyonidus> bob and weave into that dempsey roll son
[2:42:22] <%FrustratedAF> @CSeriesJTYPE i like you apatDab
[2:42:23] <Zombrocom> Which one of Dante's weapons is NOT the best? Lets be real
[2:42:24] <%laserbeaming> So, how does Balrog stand among the DMC Punch Weapons? Best one yet?
[2:42:26] <%Plague_Nurse> Better than Beowulf
[2:42:27] <%ScreamingMeat> Only thing missing is a Meteor
[2:42:29] <+attackofthesage> Balrog is definitely my favorite gauntlet
[2:42:31] <%weissguard> Ippo would be proud. But Martinez would just practice his left. Kappa
[2:42:33] <leole11> you have praised EVERY SINGLE WEAPON pat lmao
[2:42:33] <mechslayer71> @cseriesjtype It’s confirmed April 1st?
[2:42:34] <%joylent_blue> CSeriesJTYPE when i realized that i was upset, because if thats not the joke they're going for i'll be DISAPPOINTED
[2:42:39] <%TheFilth> that's strong
[2:42:42] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat how much do you wanna bet like 5-10 years from now people will still find new tech in this game?
[2:42:44] <CSeriesJTYPE> @mechslayer71 yep
[2:42:47] <+Ryutaryi> That's so good
[2:42:47] <conflict1914> Is Balrog the best fist weapon? It's pretty good but i do like my charge stuff
[2:42:48] <%weissguard> YEYEYE
[2:42:49] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:42:50] <Artista_AF> LUL
[2:42:50] <%averyoddjew> Balrog is probably my favorite weapon in 5 tbh
[2:42:51] <Dragon_Batman> I'm good with that
[2:42:51] <OkamiDude15> what if you have to beat bloody palace to get virgil? woopsMB
[2:42:52] <+CampinSteve> I like the DMC1 fist weapons better
[2:42:52] <%Demon_Shadow4> too long..
[2:42:53] <damdash16> What day does BPdrop on?
[2:42:53] <%Divryne> Foolishness April. Foolishness.
[2:42:53] <CSeriesJTYPE> @joylent_blue same lmao
[2:42:53] <person181> deal
[2:42:53] <%ECRead> I approve of this
[2:42:54] <%Tyonidus> So does anybody know, are we actually getting Vergil as a playable for Bloody Palace?
[2:42:59] <dekkitout> Well earned
[2:42:59] <mechslayer71> @cseriesjtype Cool.
[2:43:01] <+emperri> so they left the song in that was sang by the guy who fucked a chick that was legal where he did it? did resetera shit and cum over it?
[2:43:02] <Mr_Strut> Foolishness, April! Foolishness.
[2:43:03] <$HentaiSenpai9K> GG
[2:43:06] <%valkuma> @QueequegTheater do you think maybe he saw your question the first 300 times you posted it?
[2:43:07] <%mastertwin2> Enough of this APRIL FOOLISHNESS, Dante!
[2:43:07] <anuchallengertwitch> I think Ifrit from Dmc1 is pretty cool.
[2:43:08] <DeebzNutz100> Damn, now i have to buy a new calender
[2:43:08] <dukenux> I need more PRANK
[2:43:13] <%Birdigalore> So April 1st we all stab ourselves in the chest and pray for Devil powers?
[2:43:18] <%joylent_blue> who is April and why is she so foolish?
[2:43:20] <%QueequegTheater> @valkuma no
[2:43:21] <%Tyonidus> YO
[2:43:23] <Artista_AF> Balrog is cool, still think Beowulf is the coolest looking of the punch weapons
[2:43:27] <mechslayer71> @emperri Different singer now, they edited out the guy
[2:43:28] <PrinceOfEden> You're all wrong. April 1st is known as BLOODY FUCKING PALACE

[2:43:43] <CSeriesJTYPE> IGNITE THE FLAME
[2:43:44] <dukenux> LUL
[2:43:45] <%TheFilth> now that's a good angle
[2:43:45] <mayorrev> Love the shield!
[2:43:51] <Zombrocom> I don't think Bloody Palace is exactly April 1st, just april right?
[2:43:51] <+CampinSteve> thong urien as a dmc character
[2:43:53] <%ScreamingMeat> Aww, that missed Real Impact would have been so cool
[2:43:53] <%Ion_LaserX> Good Photo!
[2:43:56] <$valriot> Yeah, no way is Vergil not coming on April 1st with Bloody Palace now, oh course its april foolishness
[2:43:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sleepy Demon Boye
[2:43:58] <dukenux> just fucking beaten on the ground
[2:44:00] <%joylent_blue> CampinSteve i thought you misspelled urizen and got confused
[2:44:01] <Zombrocom> Or did they say april 1st
[2:44:02] <CSeriesJTYPE> I think they said april 1st
[2:44:05] <+emperri> @mechslayer71 shows him for having sex I guess
[2:44:06] <wolvenelf> niicr
[2:44:09] <+CampinSteve> @joylent_blue lmfao
[2:44:10] <Zombrocom> Oh sweet
[2:44:11] <Asuxley> what was that?
[2:44:13] <+namillus> Can we talk about how Balrog has both Rising Dragon AND Real Impact? Previously I was under the impression that they were the same move with a different name
[2:44:14] <dukenux> ImpreSSSive
[2:44:15] <OkamiDude15> they said april 1st
[2:44:18] <DeebzNutz100> dood3S -- Nicely done!
[2:44:20] <+CampinSteve> do you not want aegis refleector combos?
[2:44:21] <%joylent_blue> YEAH
[2:44:21] <CSeriesJTYPE> yeah I just checked the twitter, april 1st

[2:44:33] <EBT93> I honestly like the change to Real Impact. Now you can’t just spam it to win.
[2:44:34] <+DeRedBaron> giligamesh had the same thing too
[2:44:42] <+countgaculatv> April Foolishness Dante, Foolishness
[2:44:44] <conflict1914> can see you fishing for that quad s
[2:44:48] <+CampinSteve> urien's magic meter could be his metallic aura to absorb hits
[2:44:49] <Goldenwolf98> @AngriestPat do you have an enemy in the game that you dont like at all? For me its the nameless
[2:44:52] <+namillus> @Asuxley After your first clear of the game, the game will take photos of each enemy the first time you kill them on successive runs and if you don't like the photo it produces you can ask for a retake in the Gallery.
[2:44:54] <%laserbeaming> I'm not a big fan of Cavaliere
[2:44:54] <FenixSeraph> wonder why Subhuman only plays in some fights
[2:44:54] <%joylent_blue> alright i'm putting Cavalier back on my bar
[2:44:55] <%Solidnick18> that was alright
[2:44:57] <%Divryne> He tried.
[2:44:58] <%ShaneWhite> Just got back what did I missed
[2:44:59] <mechslayer71> Sin DT wasted LUL

[2:45:20] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is "If I beat Nero then by default I beat you" your favorite Vergil characterization, or is "I want yours too" still better?
[2:45:21] <ArthurDoyleRPG> The nobodies
[2:45:21] <anuchallengertwitch> Behemoths
[2:45:22] <+CampinSteve> not wasted
[2:45:22] <silverback129> I just found out Urizen is just another name for YOUR REASON
[2:45:24] <%Divryne> Furies are easy when you know the pattern.

[2:45:26] <EBT93> Fury and Hell Judecca
[2:45:27] <phoenix_games87> the commanders for me they warp too much
[2:45:33] <PrinceOfEden> LUL
[2:45:33] <DeebzNutz100> depends on who i am playing as
[2:45:33] <+attackofthesage> If you can JC the fire bats are fun to screw with
[2:45:35] <%Divryne> Furies are also easy to parry.
[2:45:35] <%Solidnick18> fire bats also
[2:45:36] <PrinceOfEden> Doesn't even react

[2:45:48] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> What movie is dis?
[2:45:52] <reiju_22> he is old :(
[2:45:52] <rekinom> Vergil embraces his boomer status
[2:45:53] <%joylent_blue> i love Vergils characterization by the end
[2:45:53] <%QueequegTheater> @valkuma Kappa
[2:45:54] <person181> he's old
[2:45:55] <%Divryne> Vergil is sad cause he did a genocide/
[2:45:56] <mrpandabear437> vergil got SO many people killed
[2:45:56] <TheBlankAce> V's characterization carried ober
[2:45:57] <dukenux> DONT SAY IT
[2:45:58] <EBT93> Just Honeycomb the Hell Bats.

[2:46:04] <+Ryutaryi> Vergil in the van is the best when he's with Nero.
[2:46:05] <Morning_Asakura> JACK--
[2:46:05] <Jibbleheimer> Has Pat beaten it on stream? Am I too late?
[2:46:05] <%TheFilth> it only took murdering an entire city for him to learn his lesson
[2:46:05] <+trekkie11041> vergils time as V affected him in some way
[2:46:07] <OkamiDude15> fire bats you just gotta face fuck'em with air combos and not shoot them sfhMEH
[2:46:07] <%phamchri> thats mostly cause V i think
[2:46:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think it's because of his V experience
[2:46:08] <%treebeard24> he's laid back because all of his mundus PTSD is gone now
[2:46:08] <VanLynx> he does get fucked up by his son when he's the strongest he's ever been tbf
[2:46:08] <jorgeniev> he cracks a smile at dante at the end
[2:46:09] <AutechreTwinAphex> that sound effect of his sword swing was from DMC2 LUL
[2:46:09] <silvcrest> I think Vergil was just done with it by that point, he wasn't MOTIVATED
[2:46:09] <DarbyV> the only time any enemies suck is in DMD, but that's more of a flaw with that difficulty setting than the actual enemy design
[2:46:10] <person181> 'how do you know that phrase'
[2:46:12] <%FrustratedAF> yama toe
[2:46:12] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:46:15] <Sheepeze> Vergil is too old for this shit
[2:46:16] <StrangeCoincidence> Samir you are breaking the car!!!
[2:46:19] <KungFooMaen> Chilled when he found out about having a son
[2:46:20] <+countgaculatv> 2 Boomers at this birthday party
[2:46:26] <dsauce999> MARTHA?!?!?!
[2:46:26] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> Nice Buscemi poster yo
[2:46:27] <PrinceOfEden> Let's not forget, Vergil wipes out an entire fucking city just to get stronger than Dante. No amount of work can atone for that.
[2:46:28] <%Birdigalore> I love the bits of Vergiul and Dante just chillin' in the van at the end
[2:46:29] <damdash16> Hope vergil gets a beowulf moveset with the urizen boss moves
[2:46:30] <Zombrocom> Oh my god, Virgil sitting next to nero in the Van in the main menu is the best thing
[2:46:30] <%Divryne> Deep down he loves his brother.
[2:46:32] <%ShaneWhite> Vergil smoked that devil grass @angriestpat
[2:46:35] <%Birdigalore> *Vergil
[2:46:37] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat is there any enemies you think arent designed for certain characters? I noticed in sos they seem reluctant to make dante fight the DmC purple style enemies
[2:46:40] <$valriot> Cos Nero is stronger so now beating Dante is just for fun
[2:46:43] <phoenix_games87> its because of V
[2:46:45] <StrangeCoincidence> why did vergil turn into a tree?
[2:46:47] <%joylent_blue> they smile at each other for like the first GENUINE time, its so fucking heart warming
[2:46:48] <%ScreamingMeat> My theory is that all of V's character development is put into Vergil when he fuses with Urizen.
[2:46:53] <+Xombor> The ending would be okay but Vergil was responsible for the deaths of countless innocent people in the city and no one seems to mention it
[2:46:53] <%QueequegTheater> @PrinceOfEden Urizen did that, Vergil isn't responsible for that
[2:46:53] <%Solidnick18> cascade
[2:46:56] <ArthurDoyleRPG> That's V's influence most likely
[2:46:58] <%TheFilth> @PrinceOfEden to be fair that was his unfiltered demon half, when Vergil split that wasn't his plan
[2:47:01] <%Gogogolem> He's accepted dante has a bigger dick than him.
[2:47:02] <%lloyddboy> RIP
[2:47:06] <%zafooru> ok so what's dumber, Cavalier or dual wielding kalina anns
[2:47:06] <ThorW> I'm guessing Devil Hunter difficulty?

[2:48:05] <%QueequegTheater> MonkaA
[2:48:15] <Shining_Armor> @PrinceOfEden He ate an entire city. They were dead.
[2:48:15] <conflict1914> Vegeta's a way better dad then Vergil
[2:48:16] <dsauce999> cmonA
[2:48:17] <$MightyMaxT> Vergeta
[2:48:18] <%KaironFortressKnight> took me a bit to S rank it
[2:48:18] <gustavozxd> this mission took me a while to get S in SoS
[2:48:19] <forgetme000> these guys should make youtube videos
[2:48:19] <%hntronium> Vergetil
[2:48:19] <%FrustratedAF> MonkaS ?
[2:48:21] <+conradical> the plastic ones
[2:48:23] <%Plague_Nurse> That would imply Vegeta is a good character
[2:48:23] <DeebzNutz100> Dummies should be used unnecessarily at any given moment in every film
[2:48:24] <PrinceOfEden> @Shining_Armor Dragon Balls
[2:48:25] <Mr_Strut> When do we get Vergil in a pink shirt?
[2:48:25] <%Birdigalore> Nero is such a Trunks lol

[2:48:31] <%QueequegTheater> @Plague_Nurse He is
[2:48:32] <person181> such a cool sword
[2:48:32] <%joylent_blue> Vegeta actually loves his wife
[2:48:33] <%badchoice5> Except Vegeta didn't rip of Trunk's arm for MORE POWER
[2:48:35] <EBT93> Vergil’s Darth Vader.
[2:48:35] <%kiiiirsten> Nero is doing SERIOUS acting

[2:50:28] <R3c0n31> Ha there was a laugh lolol

[2:50:36] <%aishman> aishman subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 7 month streak! More money to my favorite dungeon goblin. Thank you for all the amaizing content that bightens up my day. So shine on you crazy diamond!
[2:50:37] <%KaironFortressKnight> oh nooooo
[2:50:38] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Dante's Devil Arm would be a Pizza Cutter Devil Arm
[2:50:39] <$HentaiSenpai9K> This is so JAV XD
[2:50:41] <+Risingxiv> whoa, I seen this anime
[2:50:43] <%ScreamingMeat> Oh yeah, what would a Devil Sword Vergil even look like and do?
[2:50:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is way creepier than the tentacles LUL
[2:50:46] <%JoshTheFace> this is the best LUL
[2:50:49] <%Piemen99> i seen enough hentai see where that was going
[2:50:49] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> Oh for sure lol
[2:50:54] <mikesapartment> isnt this a storyboard?
[2:50:57] <yuribo26> They don't save anything, all companies do this
[2:50:58] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Motion capture is super expensive
[2:50:59] <dukenux> It's for animators
[2:51:00] <%QueequegTheater> Visual storyboards
[2:51:04] <VanLynx> you want to get this right
[2:51:04] <Parapattern> I like how it's completely ducktape
[2:51:05] <phoenix_games87> he explained it in an interview
[2:51:05] <person181> blocking for sure
[2:51:05] <%joylent_blue> ScreamingMeat i like to think its just Yamato but like, Masamune length
[2:51:06] <+HeadsHeldHigh> so you have to do it right the first time
[2:51:07] <mayorrev> this is basically a storyboard
[2:51:08] <Artista_AF> & time is even more costly than money
[2:51:08] <Valdorick> This is just fancy story boarding
[2:51:12] <%Ion_LaserX> those mocap suits and cameras cost apatBig Money
[2:51:13] <FenixSeraph> this is the step after storyboarding
[2:51:14] <yuribo26> This is reference for animation
[2:51:17] <%TheFilth> I love how this game canonised Vergil as a huge William Blake nerd
[2:51:18] <VRNK> yeah
[2:51:20] <Dragon_Batman> be was the word
[2:51:22] <%Birdigalore> Good word make smart brain
[2:51:23] <+conradical> good job pat
[2:51:24] <TakesGuts> this is just reference
[2:51:24] <+SinisterShepard> Same use as storyboards but even more precise
[2:51:25] <+conradical> you are the do it
[2:51:26] <Dragon_Batman> you were looking for
[2:51:27] <%lloyddboy> NOW
[2:51:29] <thebehatted> is it possible to equip rebellion again?
[2:51:29] <NeetKiller> thanks Capcom
[2:51:30] <person181> this is just DMC5 the play before it became a movie
[2:51:30] <phoenix_games87> they do this first to make sure the scenes look correct before they start the animation to see what they need to make
[2:51:31] <%badchoice5> Cogent Pat
[2:51:35] <dsauce999> So the moral of the story is to just release these cutscenses to save money.
[2:51:36] <OkamiDude15> ignite the flame... NOW woopsHyper
[2:51:41] <aiyobro> no way, they motion capture that and rig it to the model
[2:51:42] <lionmanguy> !uptime
[2:51:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 51m.
[2:51:44] <+CampinSteve> SHINRAI JIPPUKYAKU
[2:51:44] <%Tyonidus> So was Dante absorbing power from the Qlipoth while he was comatose?
[2:51:45] <mechslayer71> Time for the best fight in the game soon guys PogChamp
[2:51:47] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> I get it now, that's pretty cool
[2:51:52] <Goldenwolf98> THERES THAT FUCKO ENEMY doodStare
[2:51:52] <+chaumiester> Are Dante's buttons customized as well for you?
[2:51:52] <OkamiDude15> @thebehatted after you beat the game yes
[2:51:59] <+Dovakhin573> doing the mocap
[2:52:03] <Quikanims> is this son of sparda?
[2:52:06] <+Austinck> so how did dante get the balrog
[2:52:08] <%edgeyberzerker> edgeyberzerker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Just stopping in to say hi. Hope you're feeling better!
[2:52:10] <%FrustratedAF> this is SoS
[2:52:10] <thebehatted> that's good to hear, I love DSD but rebellion's still cool
[2:52:10] <%laserbeaming> YOU CANNOT KILL Me
[2:52:12] <%Ion_LaserX> @Quikanims yeah
[2:52:16] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat how do you feel about new subhuman, after hearing it ingame?
[2:52:17] <%Birdigalore> Can we get a mod when G says "Light it up" when Balrog ignites lol
[2:52:23] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Dempshey Rolll
[2:52:25] <dsauce999> KINGDOM HEARTS BAYBEE
[2:52:25] <+Tusktuki> doodStare
[2:52:27] <R3c0n31> Man i know the OG song of Dantes was bad, but damn did it grow on me before the update to it
[2:52:28] <OkamiDude15> @Austinck apparently its in the light novel
[2:52:36] <%joylent_blue> Austinck he fought the demon Balrog in the prequel novel, Balrog was basically like "you're cool, i'm going with you" and Dante was like "eh, okay"
[2:52:37] <Dragon_Batman> Catchy as fuck though
[2:52:39] <@Mechz71> it fucking sucks ass
[2:52:41] <Quikanims> God this game is so sick
[2:52:44] <+Tusktuki> Replace it with Little V's Subhuman
[2:52:47] <%weissguard> weissguard is continuing the Gift Sub they got from MrBorisMakarov! 
[2:52:47] <Malziel> ^^^
[2:52:48] <+chaumiester> Any changes to Dantes Default buttons?
[2:52:50] <phoenix_games87> when did they do the new subhuman
[2:52:53] <Naixoram> I think that might actually be a bug @AngriestPat
[2:52:54] <+TransporterX7> Yeah there are ALOT of boss tracks
[2:52:55] <Naixoram> I've heard such
[2:52:57] <+meatxsteam> Hell yeah Tusktuki
[2:52:57] <jinking79> LittleV saved that song
[2:52:59] <Halospaz117> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:00] <%Birdigalore> Well I mean it's Devil Trigger
[2:53:01] <anuchallengertwitch> Yeah you only hear it for three missions
[2:53:02] <+Tusktuki> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:02] <pwnhills> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:02] <+TheoTTree> crimson cloud
[2:53:02] <%Gespens> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:03] <sir_nack> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:03] <Malziel> Crimson Cloud Kreygasm
[2:53:03] <Odinhasnobooty> Crimson Cloud is V's song
[2:53:04] <yuribo26> Savior! Bloodstained! Hellfire! Shadow!
[2:53:04] <+TransporterX7> That play during their fights
[2:53:10] <ArthurDoyleRPG> The less subhuman the better
[2:53:11] <%badchoice5> Is it because you suck with them?
[2:53:12] <%Freelance7> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:12] <mechslayer71> Crimson Cloud
[2:53:13] <Zombrocom> FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
[2:53:14] <%QueequegTheater> @phoenix_games87 after the singer turned out to be a sex criminal
[2:53:14] <asd2897> u sure its just you not getting the style points
[2:53:18] <%RioGascar> Is there any enemy you hate to fight as certain characters? i fear what DmD will be like for V and if they go “fight a fury”
[2:53:21] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat I hope Death Stranding has those cheap cutscenes
[2:53:22] <%laserbeaming> Crimson Cloud? Like that thing in New Vegas' DLC
[2:53:23] <dukenux> If you have to ask ITS TOO LATE
[2:53:23] <%ECRead> Crimson Cloud reeeeeally grew on me
[2:53:25] <$D4C_Trice> all versions of subhuman suck if you ask me
[2:53:28] <Dragon_Batman> V, I can get but Nero is the main man which is why they play it
[2:53:32] <%Freelance7> Crimson Cloud is really good
[2:53:36] <StrangeCoincidence> is dante like 9000 years old?
[2:53:37] <Naixoram> It seems like sometimes the ambient music will keep playing and the battle theme won't kick in
[2:53:38] <PrinceOfEden> @asd2897 Yeah, Balrog's voice is also the default style announcer.
[2:53:41] <+Tusktuki> And the BM
[2:53:42] <+Austinck> crimsions cloud sounds like a jojo thing
[2:53:42] <%FrustratedAF> damn i want morrison for dante's style announcer :/
[2:53:43] <gustavozxd> it's because there's a lot of fights with different themes that aren't their main themes
[2:53:44] <+namillus> Yeah it feels like V and Dante have a lot of atmospheric THEMING tracks in their fights
[2:53:44] <sir_nack> does distorted real impact still work the same?
[2:53:44] <sileo_patronus> yeah crimson cloud is great
[2:53:44] <Naixoram> but maybe that's just a stylistic choice?
[2:53:48] <+kravdra> how do we feel about no reversals ? you think capcoms gonna add it back in ?
[2:53:51] <%joylent_blue> StrangeCoincidence nah, he's canonically like 40 something now
[2:53:51] <+countgaculatv> @AngriestPat So Devil Trigger Vanilla, LittleVMills version, or Silver Bullet Remix (final boss version)?
[2:53:52] <phoenix_games87> i wonder if one of vergils styles will be what V's moves were
[2:53:54] <anuchallengertwitch> @AngriestPat Subhuman only plays for Dante's first three missions and his section in the credits.
[2:53:54] <%laserbeaming> Red Bois!
[2:53:58] <%Birdigalore> YOU STINK
[2:53:59] <thebehatted> you STINK

[2:54:31] <$valriot> @riogascar DMD enemy lay out is same as SOS, just fuck ton more health and damage and DT. V has his own issues in DMD like summons dying in 1-2 hits
[2:54:33] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> @Pyr0_Fr0st Death Stranding looks cray cray
[2:54:33] <%FrustratedAF> wait a minute that didn't sound like Little V Mills DansGame
[2:54:34] <PrinceOfEden> My only issue with the fury, is how he's immune to damage while he's about to phase. Otherwise, he's a cool enemy.
[2:54:35] <%blastazoid26> apatDab
[2:54:37] <+Andrizzleton> @angriestpat why not change it to lock and load ?

[2:55:04] <+namillus> @Andrizzleton That wouldn't solve the Specific Scenario Battle Tracks that happen a lot in this game
[2:55:07] <gustavozxd> I feel uncomfortable when I see people using 4 weapons at the same time
[2:55:07] <%lloyddboy> @AngriestPat you reckon SSSS rank is Distorted Real Impact turned into a more general gameplay mechanic?

[2:55:42] <Nina96> SPLOOSH
[2:55:42] <+Austinck> what does more damage that or the gerbra lazer beam
[2:55:44] <LiquidMathew> Gunslinger is great
[2:55:47] <%Ion_LaserX> apatBig Damage
[2:55:48] <Goldenwolf98> That is not how rocket launchers work doodHokey
[2:55:48] <mechslayer71> Hold it to make it go Longer @angriestpat

[2:55:52] <+Tusktuki> doodCrazy doodBeamR doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[2:55:54] <gogoszy> STRIKE FREEDOM, BOIS
[2:55:55] <+namillus> Stamen Ray is BAD
[2:55:55] <Naixoram> Dr Faust's meteor does EVEN MORE damage @AngriestPat
[2:55:57] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat has woolie still not beaten this game somehow and just has to grind early missions?
[2:56:00] <%Birdigalore> gERBERA LASER IS KINDA MEH HONESTLY =/
[2:56:01] <%joylent_blue> Austinck the Gerbera beam actually really sucks damage wise
[2:56:01] <degamk619> Really don’t try that at home kids
[2:56:02] <Zombrocom> Gerbera is a bitch compared to Kalina
[2:56:03] <dsauce999> FLEX TAPE
[2:56:03] <%ShaneWhite> Jontron refrence
[2:56:04] <%Birdigalore> sry for caps
[2:56:04] <+namillus> You use Gerbera for Petal Ray
[2:56:13] <$valriot> Breaks Scissors into shit
[2:56:14] <+namillus> Which does a HUGE amount of damage the more it bounces
[2:56:14] <+Einherjart> Fuck the Strike, that's the X!
[2:56:14] <%laserbeaming> You've seen how much style you get from Evony/Ivory's back forward circle? You go from D to A.
[2:56:23] <+CampinSteve> the fact he does stupid bruce lee movie sounds its my favorite
[2:56:26] <forgetme000> Nero and V's themes are hint to their roles in the story but Subhuman i dont see what it has to do with dante other than Hype
[2:56:33] <SsHomes> is this sos?
[2:56:33] <Dragon_Batman> They probably did that on purpose
[2:56:37] <anuchallengertwitch> "You Cannot Kill Me" during the S rank is the hypest shit
[2:56:40] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Would you like them to bring back any more DMC1 and 3 weapons as DLC?
[2:56:42] <+Vivaciousx3> can you imagine the shit they could pull with nevan in this game?
[2:56:48] <%QueequegTheater> @forgetme000 because Subhuman is from Urizern's PoV
[2:56:49] <Odinhasnobooty> How's Paige doing right now? Still high as a kite?
[2:56:50] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat cerberus has the ice of cerberus, the lighting attacks from nevan, and the fire attacks from agni and rudra
[2:56:52] <yuribo26> May brain can't handle ebony and ivory on two buttons
[2:56:56] <Goldenwolf98> I love how they finally made gunslinger useful
[2:57:00] <%averyoddjew> so he sells his old devil arms, right? Who the fuck would buy Agni and Rudra?
[2:57:01] <%laserbeaming> I can't remember the names of moves. Too many moves!
[2:57:04] <%joylent_blue> the only other weapon i'd want is Alastor tbh
[2:57:06] <derekwst3> you should see if there is another weapon where ladys was
[2:57:07] <%SaltyDongs> F
[2:57:08] <sileo_patronus> that was ambitious
[2:57:11] <%Tyonidus> @forgetme000 he's literally "subhuman" he hates his demon side and that's half of him so...
[2:57:11] <+CampinSteve> who wouldnt buy agni and rudra?
[2:57:14] <Zombrocom> Who WOULDN'T buy Agni and Rudra?
[2:57:14] <+CampinSteve> theyre total bros
[2:57:15] <PrinceOfEden> I know they responded to nero being more simple when compared to dante by giving him more devil breakers, but I kinda wish he got another weapon.
[2:57:15] <%joylent_blue> oh wait, Agni and Rudra
[2:57:18] <yuribo26> @laserbeaming this games only has around 400 moves bro
[2:57:18] <Sanyle> @forgetme000 they thought they were doing a song for DmC dante and went for that instead of our loveable gay cowboy
[2:57:21] <PrinceOfEden> Maybe a hammer or something.
[2:57:22] <%badchoice5> Pat, eating hits like this is why you don't hear Subhuman more
[2:57:22] <OkamiDude15> @forgetme000 wasnt it mentioned that subhuman was written for DmC dante instead of this dante? i remember hearing that somewhere woopsThink
[2:57:26] <gustavozxd> I would like to see some other weapons even if they're just "clone" weapons that look different, like alastor
[2:57:36] <Sanyle> Im not joking read the wiki
[2:57:37] <%SaltyDongs> Can't bust a nut
[2:57:37] <Zombrocom> @OkamiDude15 I think that was just a rumor
[2:57:40] <+Tusktuki> Probably can only get that in DT safely....well reletively safely
[2:57:48] <DaBigVitus> Icechucks AND double kolina ann? Niiiice
[2:57:49] <conflict1914> Purge the xeno
[2:57:52] <%Ion_LaserX> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[2:57:52] <%Birdigalore> EZ SSS
[2:57:53] <forgetme000> makes sense
[2:57:54] <+namillus> @gustavozxd So Alastor as a skin for Sparda, since they originated in the same game?
[2:57:57] <thebehatted> goddamn that style
[2:57:58] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Lotta style
[2:57:58] <yuribo26> Nobodies have so much health
[2:58:00] <%Nobrev> @forgetme000 I think it's because dante sees demons as less than human so by fusing with rebellion and sparda he sees that as gaining incredible power at the cost of his humanity
[2:58:03] <anuchallengertwitch> @forgetme000 Subhuman hints at Dante's inner feelings. Dante despises his demon side and would rather be without it, and has to remind himself to keep his humanity no matter what. by mission 13, he stabs himself with rebellion and accepts his demon side.
[2:58:03] <GrandmasterBFunk> King Cerberus is so much fun in this game
[2:58:06] <+CampinSteve> dance macabre?
[2:58:07] <%TheFilth> knocked his mask off
[2:58:10] <Joey1995456> Just do weapon skins, like seeing alastor skin with the lightning for DsD
[2:58:11] <+TransporterX7> POOOLE DANCIN
[2:58:12] <%joylent_blue> accidental parries FeelsGoodMan
[2:58:14] <+keksisblyat> I just got my first 3mil red orb taunt! I got the one for Nero first. Time to get the other 2!
[2:58:14] <Dragon_Batman> Parried his mask off I think
[2:58:15] <+Einherjart> My little Dante can't be this STYLISH.
[2:58:15] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Would you like to see more DMC1 and 3 weapons brought back as DLC free or otherwise?
[2:58:17] <%DK_Rance> LUL
[2:58:18] <conflict1914> it begins
[2:58:19] <sir_nack> @OkamiDude15 that literally just comes from the song description calling dante 'foul mouthed', which aint much to go on
[2:58:20] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL

[2:58:29] <GDandy_> sword-trick-sword-trick-sword
[2:58:31] <$SGrim> Quick, get a third Maria-Ann
[2:58:31] <conflict1914> You cant go a session playing dante without doing that
[2:58:31] <troxcree> King cerberus has the best air swordmaster move.
[2:58:33] <%Birdigalore> Dante are you ok? Are you ok? Are you ok, Dante?
[2:58:33] <+MrBotchamania> Same.
[2:58:37] <%laserbeaming> gunswordtrickswordtrickguard
[2:58:37] <weontheultralightbeam> Agni and Rudra tho

[2:58:39] <rosemon5001> THE GUITAR
[2:58:39] <%joylent_blue> A&R BibleThump
[2:58:39] <yuribo26> You gotta a FIST
[2:58:40] <+Xenoska> all you need is kick 13
[2:58:43] <+Vivaciousx3> nevan :(
[2:58:43] <Zombrocom> Agni and Rudra would be nice
[2:58:45] <%badchoice5> Man, how many more weapons do you really need
[2:58:46] <+meatxsteam> @AngriestPat That guitar tho
[2:58:47] <Naixoram> have you done this mission with zero weapons yet? it's an achievement @AngriestPat
[2:58:48] <yuribo26> Best sword by FAR
[2:58:49] <person181> nevin for the joke
[2:58:53] <NeetKiller> DMC1 Sword
[2:58:53] <Goldenwolf98> I feel like the guns could use something
[2:58:53] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat But Agni & Rudra tho
[2:58:56] <+Tusktuki> Agni and Rudra though
[2:58:57] <OkamiDude15> @Zombrocom ah gotcha sfhMEH i just want them to release that devils never cry mix from the history of dmc recap in the game cuz thats song is amazing
[2:58:58] <%ShaneWhite> What about the Master Sword
[2:59:01] <%Nobrev> I just want agni and rudra back
[2:59:01] <%treebeard24> DMC2 swords for DLC Kappa
[2:59:02] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat I wpuld like to see the charkrams from DmC back
[2:59:02] <+CampinSteve> We need a redo of spiral
[2:59:02] <GrandmasterBFunk> Cavalier isn't weird enough to be a Nevan/Lucifer replacement
[2:59:03] <%Sumdumguyy> but what if i told you lucifer
[2:59:03] <$nademonkey1100> nah you know you want nevin back
[2:59:04] <gustavozxd> I wanted to do a Japanese VA run but they're really generic in cutscenes
[2:59:04] <yuribo26> BRING NEVAN BACK - Said no one ever
[2:59:06] <%badchoice5> Nevan should come back but only as a SSS taunt
[2:59:07] <%blastazoid26> Agni and rudra
[2:59:10] <+countgaculatv> I feel like the weapon list shouldve been expanded to warant the need to limit my weapon list
[2:59:11] <darthbatman72> Agni and rudra
[2:59:12] <shotgang86> Dude, imagine if they briung back Lucifer.
[2:59:12] <Valdorick> Nevhin Is a good weapon that can't do damage or keep style, fight me.
[2:59:14] <person181> the harpoon gun from 1
[2:59:18] <Artista_AF> Agni & Rudra were dope
[2:59:23] <PrinceOfEden> I love that taunt
[2:59:23] <OldOnyx> Honestly, I only want Agni and Rudra back for the dialogue/characters
[2:59:23] <+Risingxiv> @angriestpat Will dmc ever get a Spear?
[2:59:23] <Nina96> @NeetKiller u mean force edge?
[2:59:29] <Dragon_Batman> Is there a taunt just for his Dante sword? neat.
[2:59:33] <+keksisblyat> They should bring back Nevan just to spite you Kappa
[2:59:33] <dmysta3000> Devil Sword Dante kinda replaces Lucifer imo
[2:59:37] <%TheFilth> the air GS move with the launchers is great
[2:59:40] <Artista_AF> i want Pandora to return
[2:59:42] <sir_nack> devil sword dante is SO GOOD
[2:59:43] <%joylent_blue> Lucifer would be cool, but Ecstasy already exists as a taunt
[2:59:44] <+HeadsHeldHigh> @person181 Keep it underwater only, but dont add any underwater segments Kappa
[2:59:45] <%thewildzubat> I didn't pay $60 to be told I'm Dismal over and over again
[2:59:49] <+Xombor> DMC is really missing underwater combat
[2:59:49] <NeetKiller> I mean Alastor
[2:59:50] <+CampinSteve> ok that was sick
[2:59:53] <+namillus> Dante doesn't need Lucifer, he has Ecstasy as TWO taunts
[2:59:54] <$rytyoung> What difficulty is @angriestpat playing at the moment?
[2:59:56] <DaBigVitus> Whats the red meter?
[2:59:56] <anuchallengertwitch> If they bring back nevan, they should give her to Trish
[3:00:00] <person181> @HeadsHeldHigh yes
[3:00:01] <%SaltyDongs> Rad
[3:00:02] <CalderGaming> Agni: "blah blah blah" Rudra: "blah blah blah" Dante: "No. Talking." Paige: "WHO'S TALKING?!?!"
[3:00:02] <sir_nack> son of sparda
[3:00:03] <$D4C_Trice> would you say that double kalina ann is better than pandora?
[3:00:04] <yuribo26> We need to give Vergil a gun in this too
[3:00:05] <$valriot> Kalinas air move with Gunslinger can launch enemies in the air to combo
[3:00:05] <+namillus> That said, Alastor would be PERFECT for Trish. Power synergy!
[3:00:06] <+DeRedBaron> honeslty unless they brought back nevan as a gun or that transfroms int a scythe like how balrog does, it's not gonna be that good
[3:00:07] <SsHomes> is this sons of sparda right?
[3:00:08] <Artista_AF> there's still over 500 forms we haven't seen of Pandora
[3:00:09] <PrinceOfEden> Sin DT @DaBigVitus
[3:00:09] <%Tyonidus> @Xombor lol shutup
[3:00:13] <shotgang86> wahoo
[3:00:17] <%TheFilth> the fun difficulty
[3:00:19] <%joylent_blue> DaBigVitus Sin DT, sorta god mode, doesn't last long
[3:00:21] <+Xenoska> bless ya
[3:00:22] <$rytyoung> big boy difficulty
[3:00:24] <%SaltyDongs> Bless
[3:00:24] <%Sumdumguyy> son of bugman
[3:00:25] <+Tusktuki> Son of Sparda should have been the default imo
[3:00:30] <Artista_AF> bless u
[3:00:30] <%kujofire990> do we get gay cowboy dance live action soon
[3:00:31] <kingcroix> Wollies play though on the ps4 or the ps4 pro?
[3:00:33] <CSeriesJTYPE> the fun difficulty is right
[3:00:37] <troxcree> Yeah, it's nice that it's the rockets all the time.
[3:00:37] <+Austinck> I would like to see pandroa back
[3:00:42] <DaBigVitus> @joylent_blue ok! haven't heard of that before
[3:00:45] <Ultimatefool> These guys on DMD might as well be bosses lol, they NEVER die
[3:00:47] <+countgaculatv> I feel like Dante's guns need a bit more oomf too
[3:00:54] <derekwst3> what would a pandora boss look like
[3:00:55] <DaBigVitus> Rage of the gods, kratos
[3:00:55] <%lloyddboy> EMBARRASING
[3:00:57] <+countgaculatv> Double Kalina Ann is legit though
[3:00:58] <%treebeard24> hard agree on bringing back pandora, i dont think the one with the summon spikes matters because that's basically just swordmaster now but would be cool to have the different punch variants from each game to make punch boy dante
[3:01:07] <%TheFilth> @Ultimatefool may I introduce you to DMC2?
[3:01:07] <OkamiDude15> @countgaculatv more than they get when you charge them in gunslinger?
[3:01:08] <+namillus> Coyote-A has some crazy Gunslinger stuff. Cut-In is new, right?
[3:01:10] <%ScreamingMeat> I have to qualms using Sin D.T on those fucks
[3:01:17] <CSeriesJTYPE> cut in is new yes
[3:01:22] <yuribo26> Nice parry Kappa
[3:01:22] <%TheFilth> @Ultimatefool wrong guy
[3:01:22] <CSeriesJTYPE> 4 only had gun stinger
[3:01:24] <%joylent_blue> the whiff LUL
[3:01:24] <%FrustratedAF> ah phukin luv et
[3:01:25] <Shraquet> It's a shame he had to miss.
[3:01:28] <forgetme000> I think the guitar would be funny to bring back. Not that its a must or anything but it would be fun
[3:01:32] <%Nobrev> I fucking love the "I'm bored" taunt
[3:01:35] <%MadameColeen> maybe Lady will have Pandora if there's dlc
[3:01:35] <%Trinity5> are dante's taunts kinda underwhelming compared to nero and V or am I just missing out
[3:01:40] <+CampinSteve> LMAO
[3:01:41] <+Vivaciousx3> is cut in any good? i find the input to be weird
[3:01:41] <%Trinity5> the I'm bored taunt is strong though
[3:01:43] <+verelme> S T Y L E
[3:01:45] <+Tusktuki> Taunt juggle!
[3:01:45] <yuribo26> That looked cool
[3:01:46] <+SuichiTanaka> siiiiick
[3:01:47] <Zombrocom> NICE
[3:01:48] <%Nobrev> YEYEYEYEYEY
[3:01:48] <CalderGaming> YOU ARE ALL FREE NOW
[3:01:50] <0rond> @AngriestPat did you know using ice age (cerberus back-forward) makes you an utterly and completely invincible wall? it's really cool against the spinny dudes
[3:01:51] <GrandmasterBFunk> I love the Lucifer callback in that taunt
[3:01:51] <+countgaculatv> @OkamiDude15 I find that have little combo applications save for Bullet Storm, Faust's red orb shield, and Kalina Ann finisher
[3:01:52] <+Xenoska> Not going to lie. I dislike the motorcycle weapon.
[3:01:52] <%joylent_blue> Trinity5 i sorta agree, but hes got some good ones
[3:01:53] <+HeadsHeldHigh> DARNTE
[3:01:53] <+namillus> THERE IT IS
[3:01:57] <%XzileGaming> Darn-te
[3:01:57] <person181> he can just make roses now, that's amazing
[3:01:58] <%cherubs_anonymous> You give yourself too little credit, Pat
[3:01:59] <%treebeard24> You are set FREE! apatDab
[3:02:03] <%FrustratedAF> isn't that the point?
[3:02:03] <damdash16> Trish should get a fleshed out pandora and sparda
[3:02:04] <shotgang86> Pat is getting good at this game. T O O G O O D
[3:02:07] <Zombrocom> Dante just has fewer great taunts
[3:02:07] <%Plague_Nurse> Dante has less taunts than in DMC4
[3:02:09] <CSeriesJTYPE> i mean thats kind of unfair because nero's taunts are next level
[3:02:12] <Jew_Gold> Dante's taunts are hella faster
[3:02:15] <yuribo26> What? I was in 3
[3:02:16] <%Trinity5> lmao
[3:02:17] <%Nobrev> I absolutely love dante's taunts
[3:02:17] <$rytyoung> ooh purty
[3:02:19] <D23Player> chaaaaa
[3:02:24] <%marsano168> Thats Rad
[3:02:24] <Redbzerkr> Riding High is TOO STRONG THO
[3:02:25] <nthdimensional> Hey Pat is it too late for you to do some Brainbusters on the hell knights?
[3:02:27] <$nademonkey1100> did you get that one taunt that costs a shit load
[3:02:28] <$valriot> Busted on Fury
[3:02:28] <%ScreamingMeat> Chew on THIS!
[3:02:29] <Shraquet> That's the beauty of Devil May Cry.
[3:02:29] <AnacondaVirtue> Pat why the fuck are you using Subhuman as the battle track?
[3:02:29] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Do we ever see angels in the DMC series?
[3:02:30] <troxcree> That move is great for parrying Furies.
[3:02:30] <Dragon_Batman> Gotta check those skill lists
[3:02:31] <mechslayer71> That thing fucks fury @angriestpat
[3:02:34] <%FrustratedAF> can't wait for mvc4 FeelsBadMan
[3:02:36] <%blastazoid26> how do you do that?
[3:02:36] <%joylent_blue> LETS GET AIRBORNE pvpRad
[3:02:38] <%laserbeaming> I think Nero and V got the better taunts. Dante's got the best Air Taunt though
[3:02:40] <+countgaculatv> Best tool against Fury
[3:02:40] <PrinceOfEden> Yeah, it did in DMC3
[3:02:41] <Nina96> that will help
[3:02:44] <%Plague_Nurse> @HentaiSenpai9K no thankfully
[3:02:44] <%treebeard24> isn't that just neji's spin move from naruto?
[3:02:46] <$D4C_Trice> that will be useful against fury
[3:02:47] <0rond> back>forward with cerberus
[3:02:48] <Zombrocom> V has the best taunts in the series by a mile
[3:02:50] <forgetme000> Really?
[3:02:50] <+countgaculatv> Knocks Fury's out of attack animation
[3:02:52] <Zombrocom> Change my mind
[3:02:52] <+namillus> So, uh, the rose from Dante's taunts is a projectile.
[3:02:54] <yuribo26> @treebeard24 no, and no
[3:02:55] <%RioGascar> Dantes taunts dont seem to actually have effects, neros has actual different effects
[3:02:56] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Cerberus is too good geez
[3:02:59] <+namillus> That means you can one-shot Death Scissors with it
[3:02:59] <forgetme000> thats bonkers
[3:02:59] <sir_nack> holy shit
[3:03:04] <%chocolatez3r0> @angriestpat today is my birthday :D
[3:03:05] <0rond> makes you invincible and immovable
[3:03:06] <%joylent_blue> treebeard24 you just made it cooler for me
[3:03:06] <+d00msdaydan> the best thing about cerberus is dante making all of those stupid kung fu noises
[3:03:06] <GrandmasterBFunk> seriously though i think King cerberus is my favourite weapon for dante ever, Balrog is only slightly behind it
[3:03:07] <+verelme> SINDT
[3:03:08] <%Trinity5> did he just "gotta go fast"
[3:03:14] <%thewildzubat> yea boi
[3:03:15] <%laserbeaming> yes
[3:03:19] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat dante's taunts feel unfinished
[3:03:19] <%Trinity5> oh my god that's great
[3:03:20] <%joylent_blue> chocolatez3r0 PogChamp happy bday FeelsBirthdayMan
[3:03:24] <gustavozxd> Dante sword is great but I actually prefer using sparda/rebellion
[3:03:24] <yuribo26> Dante's summoned swords are the strongest addition
[3:03:25] <person181> can't wait to see what more virgel will get
[3:03:26] <%TheGreatBamBe> How come Dante switches personalities with Cerberus
[3:03:29] <%laserbeaming> I love Long Revolver
[3:03:31] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @plague_nurse Do they ever say what happened to them?
[3:03:32] <forgetme000> Gotta move fast lol
[3:03:54] <GrandmasterBFunk> also i can't believe they had the balls to make normal DT even stronger with the summon swords
[3:03:56] <%chocolatez3r0> @joylent_blue thanks man apatBig apatDab
[3:03:59] <Quikanims> that was literally just acquilla from DmC
[3:04:04] <$rytyoung> @thegreatbambe Bruce Lee is channeling his spirit through Dante...
[3:04:05] <KnightAsteran> I didn't like balrog but when I got SM4 with Real Impact and that super Kick 13 it became my favourite
[3:04:05] <Goldenwolf98> hod I love Balrog
[3:04:06] <%Trinity5> chat, do you take more damage in ignite mode for both stances or is it only for kick mode
[3:04:06] <PrinceOfEden> NOBODY'D
[3:04:08] <+namillus> @AngriestPat have you tried killing Death Scissors with Dante's Air Taunt?
[3:04:11] <$D4C_Trice> i found a good way of dealing damage against vergil as dante in to go SDT and jump as high in the air as you can and shoot him with the r2 laser attack
[3:04:12] <+Andrizzleton> Yep
[3:04:17] <%TheGreatBamBe> true
[3:04:18] <%badchoice5> Just like KH3
[3:04:18] <VHLW> imagine a room with nobodies and furies
[3:04:18] <Goldenwolf98> god*
[3:04:19] <Nina96> they have so much health...
[3:04:23] <+HeadsHeldHigh> ??????
[3:04:26] <Ultimatefool> Amazing
[3:04:27] <yuribo26> Nice trigger LUL
[3:04:28] <%joylent_blue> HentaiSenpai9K its not a "what happened" as much as a "they were never there" i think
[3:04:29] <PrinceOfEden> LUL
[3:04:29] <Greywolf47> LUL
[3:04:36] <Halospaz117> At least it looked kinda cool
[3:04:38] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat dante's taunts feel unfinished
[3:04:43] <troxcree> I feel like Nobodies are just a little too durable.
[3:04:45] <person181> but it looked cool
[3:04:45] <%lloyddboy> you DT sploded him, no?
[3:04:49] <mechslayer71> Once you get ignited, just switch to kick mode and do pyromania, locks people the fuck down and builds style like crazy @angriestpat
[3:04:54] <Zombrocom> SSSS doesn't do the explosion
[3:04:58] <Ultimatefool> Pat how do you have so many orbs
[3:04:59] <$D4C_Trice> no DT explosion
[3:05:01] <Zombrocom> Quick change instead
[3:05:04] <%lloyddboy> ah
[3:05:05] <%Trinity5> dante you've been on a month long break Kappa
[3:05:10] <%joylent_blue> who's ready for the..... 2nd best boss
[3:05:12] <+CampinSteve> STARS!
[3:05:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Sup Shitlords
[3:05:13] <dsauce999> ROTAL GUARD
[3:05:14] <+CampinSteve> i mean SPARDA
[3:05:15] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Royal Guard: The Boss
[3:05:15] <%SaltyDongs> cocky
[3:05:15] <%TheFilth> using the square+triangle SDT move just as the runs out is so satisfying
[3:05:16] <%ScreamingMeat> That's kinda the point of Dante
[3:05:21] <%philoboy123> OP? this is a single player game
[3:05:21] <%Freelance7> SPADA
[3:05:22] <SunsetJack> God I love this boss theme.
[3:05:23] <person181> he kinda feels done with everything
[3:05:23] <Morning_Asakura> royal guard gang
[3:05:23] <Goldenwolf98> Only royal guard
[3:05:24] <+SpartanDumpster> At least we're in the age of, "whoops, we'll update it"
[3:05:25] <%RioGascar> @angriestpat how do you go out of the SIN DT with SSSS? I’ve gotten it before and i was unable to exit the state
[3:05:26] <gustavozxd> when can you even use quadruple S? I had SSS but it didn't work, idk I was pressing the wrong button or something
[3:05:26] <CSeriesJTYPE> this is honestly one of the best bosses in the whole series
[3:05:27] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[3:05:27] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I love how his motorcycles are like chainsaw axes. It's amazing.
[3:05:28] <Greywolf47> PogChamp
[3:05:28] <anuchallengertwitch> I love how Cavaliere Angelo throws a bike at Dante just like Trish did in Dmc1. Which makes sense since she's powering it. @AngriestPat
[3:05:31] <SsHomes> LUL
[3:05:32] <%Tearonex> So OP to the point where they sent him BACK to hell to get him out of the story
[3:05:32] <$rytyoung> OHH HYPE SHIT
[3:05:34] <Greywolf47> LUL
[3:05:35] <Zombrocom> SDT's Super is the best thing
[3:05:36] <0rond> HE DOESN'T KNOW
[3:05:36] <Lord_of_all_Edges> He's still in vacation mode. You can't expect him to go from a month off back into work.
[3:05:37] <Zombrocom> No?
[3:05:38] <person181> sorry what?
[3:05:39] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat It's the finisher.
[3:05:40] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat did you get the achievement for beating this boss only using royal guard?

[3:06:22] <Hellarussian> BIG oh
[3:06:22] <%joylent_blue> "ohh..."
[3:06:23] <%Plague_Nurse> It's an AOE
[3:06:23] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> The music for this fight is sooo good
[3:06:24] <+DeRedBaron> it removes the Sin DT guage so becareful
[3:06:24] <0rond> you can do it right before SDT ends
[3:06:24] <Nina96> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:06:25] <Tha_Mik> oh
[3:06:27] <+namillus> Oh my god they just use the DMC4 Angelo Fight music for that cutscene
[3:06:28] <CSeriesJTYPE> and I didnt realize that when V first sees Cavaliere he says 'I know what you are" because he ALSO knows its Trish lol
[3:06:31] <person181> all i need is that coat to become 'cutsceen' dante
[3:06:34] <Dragon_Batman> That's his Judgement cut end pretty much
[3:06:35] <OkamiDude15> so thats how people where doing that move woopsHmm
[3:06:36] <weontheultralightbeam> this boss has everything
[3:06:36] <+HeadsHeldHigh> If you switch styles, you lose
[3:06:39] <%SaltyDongs> apatBig Oppsie
[3:06:41] <%rubbishbinge> It's like showdown IIRC
[3:06:43] <%lewdskeletor13> This reminds me of a Undertale song
[3:06:44] <+TransporterX7> I REALLY need for Trish to have this weapon/moveset
[3:06:49] <0rond> this is the credo of dmc5
[3:06:51] <$rytyoung> oof
[3:06:56] <+Tusktuki> WE PLAY THIRD STRIKE
[3:07:00] <+Vivaciousx3> did you realize that for every partial block, you lose devil trigger?
[3:07:00] <Gorgodrn> @CSeriesJTYPE V in general doesn't like Angelos and knows what they are. Cause Nelo Angelo
[3:07:02] <anuchallengertwitch> Also this is technically a Mother boss fight
[3:07:02] <Zombrocom> Oh shit yeah,, if trish gets adds, give her THIS GUYS MOVESET

[3:07:13] <%joylent_blue> 0rond yeah i'll agree to that

[3:07:16] <+Risingxiv> Love this fight!
[3:07:20] <CSeriesJTYPE> @Gorgodrn yeah but then he says 'I'll be gentle"
[3:07:21] <PrinceOfEden> F
[3:07:21] <%Ion_LaserX> @Schiz_Turtles SoS
[3:07:21] <OkamiDude15> i feel the best way to get in when he teleports is to do ground trick alot
[3:07:23] <PrinceOfEden> LUL
[3:07:23] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 16 month streak!

[3:07:51] <%Nobrev> @lewdskeletor13 morrison
[3:07:54] <derekwst3> would you bring any dmc reboot weapon style back? personally like a rework Axe
[3:07:59] <$MightyMaxT> Trish with Alastor makes sense, given the lightnign aesthetic
[3:08:00] <PrinceOfEden> SIN DT
[3:08:02] <%lewdskeletor13> My favorite theme is still Urizens
[3:08:07] <%Trinity5> DAMN LET'S GO

[3:09:22] <%Solidnick18> yes it does
[3:09:26] <0rond> @AngriestPat the Square+Triangle actively consumes all your remaining SDT, but if was going to end, it's really good to use right before the gauge runs out
[3:09:26] <Zombrocom> Judgement works best as an ender, as SDTs is running out

[3:12:09] <$rytyoung> How they can block devil may cry cutscenes in real life is insane
[3:12:11] <Halospaz117> They all hang out together at the bar
[3:12:11] <Valdorick> That's a super racists statement
[3:12:12] <degamk619> Dante definitely has an Oedipus complex
[3:12:12] <+cahv123> Why do they always act like they have a journal of all d3emons.
[3:12:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Unless she's got like underworld sense?
[3:12:13] <Hellarussian> thats correct
[3:12:14] <derekwst3> Trish is a mimic
[3:12:15] <Naixoram> nah, Trish just does research on it all
[3:12:15] <LiquidMathew> Or that Urizen doesn't "feel" like a Demon
[3:12:16] <aiyobro> if that demon was that powerful it would be super old
[3:12:17] <+cahv123> I was just thinking that.
[3:12:19] <Valdorick> He could just be from another circle of hell!
[3:12:19] <%Birdigalore> Is she even from the Underworld? I thought Mundus just made her?
[3:12:19] <person181> they have a union
[3:12:19] <%alexandrecau> Could be that she just read books a lot
[3:12:21] <%TheFilth> How does Griffin know about other Demon's if he's just a memory?!
[3:12:21] <+toilet_chan> I dunno dude, do demons like get married and have babies or whatever?
[3:12:21] <%laserbeaming> Mundus had a child at some point
[3:12:22] <$MightyMaxT> Unless Trish still has demon contacts?
[3:12:22] <%Mornaka> iunno
[3:12:24] <alcors_wisdom> i mean mythogoly typically runs in circles
[3:12:24] <0rond> @AngriestPat i think it's more about why is this demon so similar to nelo angelo
[3:12:24] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s a weird thing to say Trish
[3:12:25] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Trish isn't an IMPORTANT demon
[3:12:25] <aiyobro> Demons are the old gods
[3:12:25] <artoflec> Do you think Pandora and Lucifer would be cool boss fights PogChamp
[3:12:25] <pwnhills> Trish has been around for decades now
[3:12:25] <dsauce999> hmmm
[3:12:25] <%mastertwin2> She's a weird clone demon android
[3:12:26] <$nademonkey1100> @joylent_blue my s key is fucked up
[3:12:27] <+CampinSteve> and isnt belial the child of another demon?
[3:12:28] <Amber_Crow> I thought it meant she would sense his demon-ness. Not that she knows them all.
[3:12:28] <TheBlankAce> Shes not a legendary figure thoug
[3:12:29] <$valriot> @angriestpat I just realised this is just like DongDongNeverDies
[3:12:31] <Nina96> LUL
[3:12:31] <%treebeard24> i'd assume she just knows if something's a demon or not? like weird aura shit
[3:12:32] <+Tusktuki> I think its more meaning the Greater demons that are on the level of Sparda and Mundus
[3:12:33] <%averyoddjew> demon babies are probably big deals?
[3:12:33] <CSeriesJTYPE> she can probably just tell when people are demons
[3:12:33] <Caidezes> Trish is like 12 years old.
[3:12:34] <Dragon_Batman> Griffon knows a bunch of them, it would also depend on how long ago Trish was made
[3:12:35] <jorgeniev> did you watch the new jojo op and ed?
[3:12:35] <+TransporterX7> MOTHERRR I WAS booorn...AGAIN!
[3:12:36] <+DeRedBaron> that Mundus also had a son @AngriestPat
[3:12:37] <%Divryne> I'm not your MUTHER V.
[3:12:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> trish was just an altered demon i thought
[3:12:39] <Naixoram> in the Audio CD she left the DMC business explicitly to go researching demons @AngriestPat
[3:12:43] <Halospaz117> Berial's a fucking scab
[3:12:44] <sir_nack> @AngriestPat i think its just she can tell he's different from the kinda aura he has or some shit
[3:12:45] <+TheParadoxPrototype> There's that whole thing Nico went on about relating to Demon Evolution based off their desires. If anything, I'm sure there's core demons but BOOM they become stronger.
[3:12:45] <gekizenbu> Demonic tax evasion
[3:12:45] <derekwst3> I consider Trish a mimic
[3:12:45] <Mr_Strut> Well Mundus is dead. Maybe he's the only one that can make demons?
[3:12:49] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Whaaaaaaat
[3:12:51] <%Trinity5> WOAH

[3:12:54] <%ScreamingMeat> Yeah is Bariel Mundus' son?
[3:12:54] <0rond> @AngriestPat I think it's more about why is this demon so similar to nelo angelo

[3:13:27] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat if there are no more demons left then its time to start stylin on ANGELS!!
[3:13:27] <+cahv123> I think that's the point.

[3:15:21] <MrMysteryMask> in human form they age as fast as other humans
[3:15:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> He's gonna be the final boss of Bayonetta 3
[3:15:22] <SchroedingersFerret> Food poisoning
[3:15:22] <+cahv123> He's most likely in his own dimension with their mother like "oops'
[3:15:22] <+namillus> Sparda sealed all his power into DSS, Rebellion and Yamato, and became a Normal Human.
[3:15:25] <SiraX666> Prolly touring vegas
[3:15:25] <%lloyddboy> @AngriestPat woke up to retirement
[3:15:25] <Valdorick> @AngriestPat Clearly, he stabbed himself with Yamato and became Dante and Vergil Kappa
[3:15:25] <C_S_N_G> He overdosed on JUSTICE
[3:15:25] <%FrustratedAF> foolishness, v
[3:15:25] <MahoganyWoods> He probably decided to quit while he was on top.
[3:15:26] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Sparda will be the final final boss of DMC
[3:15:27] <%laserbeaming> I think it was implied he sacrificed himself to seal the things?
[3:15:28] <$valriot> Crushin puss in Bayonetta land
[3:15:28] <%kiiiirsten> SICK tats
[3:15:28] <Rang0Steel> Sparda is gonna come back and slap both Dante and Vergil for being fools

[3:15:34] <forgetme000> He got old and went to florida
[3:15:34] <Nina96> the audio
[3:15:35] <JayPastaForce> He woke up to CBT
[3:15:35] <Amber_Crow> Maybe going part human made Sparda and he was cool with it
[3:15:36] <person181> he got out of the union and can't work in this realm anymore
[3:15:38] <Monkeyweed21> He divided his power into 3 swords leaving him mortal when he gave them away to his sons
[3:15:38] <Dehlome> why is his voice literally phoned in>
[3:15:39] <%Plague_Nurse> Pretty sure in dmc1 it said he died sealing the gates using ALL of his power
[3:15:42] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Maybe when demons sex up someone and get them preggers, they give their life force away
[3:15:44] <justafoxhere> Age because of sealing everything in his sword?
[3:15:44] <+PanicSwytch> Remember he sacrificed his demonic powers and used the swords to seal the dior to hell
[3:15:44] <EBT93> DMX1 says he died
[3:15:45] <%FrustratedAF> mmUTHER
[3:15:45] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Well apparently he devided his power into the Sparda Sword, the Rebellion, ANd the Yamato, so maybe it devided to much and just faded away?

[3:17:13] <indig0bird> Very accurate
[3:17:14] <sir_nack> unleash the daddy that's within meeeee~
[3:17:14] <%Zaramoth> Legendary Cowboy daddy demon slayer Dante
[3:17:15] <LiquidMathew> A prequel game about Sparda would be great because you'd have to refight all the dmc3 bosses to seal them as guardians in the tower
[3:17:16] <person181> ah yes the [DADDY TRIGGER]
[3:17:18] <%skizzuto> pull the daddy trigger for mmuther

[3:17:19] <%JJCheeker> Spank me daddy I've been bad
[3:17:21] <CalderGaming> @thefakeh the cutscenes are replaced with the mockup recordings they did to plan out the cutscenes
[3:17:23] <+namillus> I feel like Sparda wouldn't be a Style Changer.
[3:17:23] <%joylent_blue> man i was NOT in the mood for that scene right after the V scene my first playthrough LUL
[3:17:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> fucking daddy trigger goddamn LUL

[3:17:28] <+namillus> His Style is Legendary Dark Knight.
[3:17:29] <0rond> he fights dante because that's honestly the most natural interaction for them, and vergil wants to beat dante with his new power. he than fights nero because nero won't let him fight dante

[3:18:14] <%lloyddboy> FREE MONEY HAT
[3:18:15] <Valdorick> I just realized, are those little baby bitch Beowulfs?
[3:18:15] <The_Sorrow_> pat HATES FREE RORBS
[3:18:16] <Caidezes> Dr. Faust is literally free money. For real this time.
[3:18:18] <%TheFilth> I get way too anxious using Faust because I risk losing muh orbs
[3:18:21] <%lewdskeletor13> You can get so much free money from it
[3:18:21] <%joylent_blue> you can use Faust without using rorbs
[3:18:22] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat oh, pat you dont know? if you use faust just getting hit will make you lose red orbs as long as a faust hat is in play.
[3:18:23] <+BubbleyBloos> I had no idea fury ate shit to the punches
[3:18:24] <alcors_wisdom> pat, known for hating free money
[3:18:25] <+keksisblyat> Pat Faust hat, gunslinger, and spamming B is literally free money
[3:18:29] <OkamiDude15> i now understand how to kill those enemies as dante woopsMB
[3:18:29] <%joylent_blue> just don't get hit 4Head
[3:18:34] <LeonSteel> >Not royalguarding
[3:18:37] <OneGorillionDollars> Local man HATES free money
[3:18:38] <$rytyoung> if only there was a Micheal Jackson taunt when you used Faust ...
[3:18:39] <gustavozxd> this room is awful this mission is kinda trash
[3:18:41] <MeGrimlock69> pat stop getting fucked
[3:18:41] <%snow_bush> Crap, I missed most of this through maps and mini painting. Is Dante now a gay cowboy?
[3:18:43] <+BubbleyBloos> Machine gun blow is too mighty
[3:18:45] <Amber_Crow> Dante might be a little overpowered.
[3:18:45] <+namillus> [Forward+Gun] for Set Hat, then [Gun] when Dante catches the Hat and everything wearing a hat is pulled right in to your combo.
[3:18:47] <Redbzerkr> I CANT SEE SHIT
[3:18:55] <oHakumen> ^
[3:18:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I fucking love that he goes 'waaa-hoho' during the combo
[3:18:59] <anuchallengertwitch> @AngriestPat If a prequel game were made, would you also be ok with a weaker Mundus being playable along with Sparda, since they were war buddies before Mundus became the demon king.
[3:18:59] <%laserbeaming> @Agami23 you only lose red orbs if your enemy has the hat I think
[3:19:01] <%joylent_blue> snow_bush you know it
[3:19:01] <DeebzNutz100> Faust will make the 3,000,000 goal every easy
[3:19:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Dante was always a gay cowboy
[3:19:10] <%alexandrecau> hate those root thingies they just suck
[3:19:12] <Goldenwolf98> I hate the butcher enemies I dont like being punished for using knock back attacks when that is like 50% of every characters moves
[3:19:13] <dukenux> Only 500000 orbs to unlock that taunt, tho PogChamp
[3:19:20] <laazybulbasaur> YOU CAN NOT KILL ME
[3:19:27] <%TheFilth> the air juggling potential with Cavalier is judgement nut-worthy
[3:19:28] <alcors_wisdom> the real demon was the gay cowboy hats we made along the way
[3:19:32] <gustavozxd> these weird towers are so bad
[3:19:35] <sir_nack> @Goldenwolf98 do combo
[3:19:35] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat What if in the Sparda game, Mundus shows Sparda what happens to traitors and opens a portal to CBT Sparda getting tortured, and then Sparda goes ‘good thing I’m not him’
[3:19:37] <Coreagrus> Lusachias can be really scary. Those buggers have a lot of spells.
[3:19:39] <$rytyoung> Gay cowboy to emo kid to having both in one game
[3:19:42] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Why does the family garden have a BLOOD FOUNTAIN!?
[3:19:43] <%Zaramoth> The Legendary Devil Hunter, Cowboy Daddy Dante
[3:19:46] <%TheGreatBamBe> @AngriestPat So why did Morrison go from a white guy in the anime to a black guy in the game? Is he like Birdie from SF1?
[3:19:47] <%badchoice5> Just hit more goodly
[3:19:49] <%lewdskeletor13> The new Subhuman is mediocre but it’s grown on me
[3:19:49] <PowerWeightedCell> using only 2 styles might be a factor too
[3:19:53] <0rond> farming orbs in thie game is EZ, you go to mission 13 as dante, to the area where there are 4 demon spawners, than just spam hat gunslinger button
[3:20:00] <+PanicSwytch> Daddy chill
[3:20:00] <dsauce999> @angriestpat which ex taunt you gonna get firat?
[3:20:06] <+namillus> @ScreamingMeat Demon Magic for the secret entrance, don't worry about it
[3:20:07] <dsauce999> *first
[3:20:08] <forgetme000> Imagine Vergil in this mode
[3:20:16] <+Dovakhin573> The butcher guys are annoying at first till you realize that they will always do that so they are easy to punish/dodge/ parry
[3:20:19] <Valdorick> Just make the Sparda Game a 1 to 1 recreation of all things Bardok Kappa
[3:20:30] <+meatxsteam> @AngriestPat The song isn't super great but man is it fun to say "You cannot kill me"
[3:20:30] <Monkeyweed21> Dante's EX taunt is the best one
[3:20:31] <ivoryrosee> which difficulty is this?
[3:20:31] <$D4C_Trice> Dante throws a rose for his air taunt
[3:20:33] <%joylent_blue> TheGreatBamBe this is sorta deconfirmed in the documents, but i like the idea that "Morrison" is a code name for the person the government has watch over Dante / give him jobs
[3:20:33] <%skizzuto> I think you proounced V wrong
[3:20:35] <dsauce999> Barda?
[3:20:36] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat I'll I can hear now with Subhuman now is "I AM A MANGO!"
[3:20:37] <%TheFilth> When they include Vergil I pray to all the gods he gets a unique battle track
[3:20:38] <$MightyMaxT> EX Taunts: Nero=V>>>>Dante
[3:20:39] <PowerWeightedCell> main character but he could be removed from the story of DMC5 and nothing would happen Kappa
[3:20:41] <%Trinity5> "been a while since i used my brain this much" 4Head
[3:20:55] <+meatxsteam> I MUST EXPLODE
[3:20:57] <%Trinity5> @PowerWeightedCell are you calling my son dead weight?
[3:20:57] <oHakumen> air guitar with real guitar sounds
[3:21:05] <CSeriesJTYPE> does anyone else feel like this game is heavily implying that being part human makes you more powerful than being all demon
[3:21:07] <samiscoolbro> Dead weight can’t be main character Kappa
[3:21:14] <+Dovakhin573> Yeah
[3:21:16] <%lewdskeletor13> The events of the anime are canon, but with Black Morrison
[3:21:20] <gustavozxd> judeccas are big assholes
[3:21:20] <+Dovakhin573> Is the saiyan thing
[3:21:27] <%Trinity5> @CSeriesJTYPE might be some dbz shit where being human helps you unlock some latent potential faster
[3:21:28] <+namillus> @CSeriesJTYPE This has been canon since DMC4. Humanity's heart gives them the secret X-Factor.
[3:21:32] <%joylent_blue> CSeriesJTYPE yeah, 4 also implied that, japan likes the trope
[3:21:34] <dsauce999> pop your sin CBT
[3:21:37] <CSeriesJTYPE> ahhh I see
[3:21:41] <+hardwiredfire> What difficulty is this?
[3:21:44] <%Trinity5> SoS
[3:21:45] <+namillus> This is why Sparda Waking Up To Justice made him so powerful, because he learned how to Compassion.
[3:21:46] <sir_nack> @CSeriesJTYPE i think it has something to do with demons being fueled by human blood. demon/human hybrids have constant access to human blood because ya know...they have it in them
[3:21:47] <+Maids4lyfe> son of sparda
[3:21:50] <%TheFilth> the secret X-factor is MOTIVATION
[3:21:56] <ivoryrosee> thanks!
[3:21:57] <gunzerkingdunce> To those who got the deluxe, which do you prefer Calveliere normal or Calveliere R?
[3:21:58] <Quikanims> it's still so weird to me that they white washed Nico and gave Morrison black face
[3:21:59] <%Ion_LaserX> @hardwiredfire son of sparda
[3:22:02] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I want to know what Sparda told his kids before he vanished why they have a Blood Foutain and more importantly where the blood was supposed to come from.
[3:22:02] <0rond> the one thing this game is missing is for dante to be able to ride the motorcycle forever, like V's shadow skating, or atleast for a long ass time like nero's punchline
[3:22:03] <CSeriesJTYPE> oooh that makes sense considering thats what the Qliphoth is allabout
[3:22:04] <+hardwiredfire> Oh, okay. Thanks
[3:22:05] <+J_Papa> Does Pat know about the SDT finisher? I haven't seen him use it or show it off, maybe i missed it earlier in this stream\
[3:22:05] <%joylent_blue> sir_nack you know what, i like that theory
[3:22:12] <%Trinity5> just rollin up with a shotgun
[3:22:14] <+Maids4lyfe> it's the human power of love and compassion that gives them their strength
[3:22:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Demons gain power from human blood, so it makes sense that hybrids would be stronger
[3:22:15] <%Trinity5> BINCH
[3:22:15] <oHakumen> AH CHOO
[3:22:19] <Youwereeatenbyalid> One move I think?
[3:22:19] <conflict1914> It's like one move i think
[3:22:21] <OkamiDude15> isnt the only difference the coat of paint?
[3:22:22] <yuribo26> Cavalier R is red Kappa
[3:22:23] <%joylent_blue> J_Papa yeah he used it against Cavalier Angelo a while ago
[3:22:24] <Goldenwolf98> Cavalier R seems faster
[3:22:25] <+misterfistor> cavaliere r has an air stinger
[3:22:26] <+TheoTTree> Cavaliere R has an extra move but no superarmour @AngriestPat
[3:22:27] <phoenix_games87> its jusst a color
[3:22:27] <Caidezes> Cavaliere R has one extra move and less super armor.
[3:22:28] <$nademonkey1100> why does that double barrel have a mag
[3:22:28] <Monkeyweed21> Use Faust it gives Dante Snatch
[3:22:29] <troxcree> Cavallier R has an extra sword master move in the air, it's back forward.
[3:22:30] <Zombrocom> Cavaliere R is faster, has less armour, and has the Redline move, which is ok
[3:22:31] <dmysta3000> its just a recolor
[3:22:33] <SunsetJack> Cavalier R is faster, has an extra move and less hits?
[3:22:34] <TheBlankAce> Cavalier R has a different move, its in the skill list
[3:22:34] <+Vivaciousx3> R has an air stinger with swordmaster
[3:22:39] <%Nobrev> R is faster with less super armor and stagger
[3:22:41] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> One is red thats it @AngriestPat
[3:22:42] <phoenix_games87> oh wow didnt know that
[3:22:47] <+namillus> Fun fact: Demons get stronger by ingesting human blood. Our heroes get stronger by sacrificing crystallised demon blood.
[3:22:49] <LeonSteel> Cavalier R has a air Stinger @AngriestPat
[3:22:54] <0rond> @AngriestPat Cavaliere R has the swordmaster back-to-forward stinger that is also useable in the air
[3:22:56] <SomeAsianDood> So when is the part where Pat stops taking damage? Kappa
[3:23:01] <dmysta3000> Damn, seriously that's neat
[3:23:04] <%Trinity5> @SomeAsianDood never LUL
[3:23:04] <justafoxhere> Cavaliere R has less armor and a stinger that can be done ground or air
[3:23:05] <PowerWeightedCell> needs more RAINSTORM
[3:23:06] <+KSabot> cav R's air stinger is super unsafe on hit tho
[3:23:06] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @AngriestPat Cavaleire R has back forward circle in swordmaster which is a stinger that can be performed in the air or on the ground
[3:23:07] <MKII> the red paint job makes it go faster
[3:23:12] <derekwst3> is there any demon you would like to bring to bloody palace not in this game?
[3:23:15] <$rytyoung> can you change the announcers voice WHUT?!
[3:23:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Morrison sounds so different as an announcer
[3:23:20] <+Xombor> You cannot kill me I AM A MANGO
[3:23:21] <yuribo26> LUL
[3:23:22] <%lloyddboy> LUL
[3:23:25] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[3:23:29] <%aishman> Oh so what's the SSS taunt for Dante?
[3:23:29] <Redbzerkr> LUL
[3:23:29] <MonstarGrrrl> Jebaited
[3:23:32] <%badchoice5> What a stylish transformation
[3:23:33] <oHakumen> LUL
[3:23:34] <+J_Papa> So Cavalier R basically has calibur?
[3:23:34] <%joylent_blue> rytyoung its a deluxe edition thing
[3:23:34] <yuribo26> Zero
[3:23:36] <Greywolf47> Jebaited
[3:23:36] <gustavozxd> why would you use SDT against one enemy LUL
[3:23:38] <%laserbeaming> No Cuadruple S for you
[3:23:46] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I know your pain Pat :(
[3:23:48] <0rond> quadruple S is honestly a letdown
[3:23:50] <Valdorick> Because it was Quad S, so why not?
[3:23:50] <OkamiDude15> @rytyoung it comes with the deluxe edition dlc/version of the game
[3:23:51] <$rytyoung> @joylent_blue now I'm definitely upgrading
[3:23:51] <Zombrocom> @gustavozxd Because SSSS makes it free
[3:23:51] <%badchoice5> Pat is throwing away meter to prove he doesn't need it
[3:23:52] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @J_Papa yes
[3:23:54] <dukenux> You cannot KALE ME/ I am A MANGO
[3:23:56] <Gumbercules44> Nero needs DX crosschops
[3:23:58] <MeGrimlock69> is there a way to activate sin devil trigger without doing the stabbing yourself animation?
[3:24:08] <+BubbleyBloos> What's the glorb count at
[3:24:09] <CSeriesJTYPE> no
[3:24:11] <Morning_Asakura> F R E E
[3:24:14] <MeGrimlock69> dang
[3:24:16] <CSeriesJTYPE> you can do it in the air tho
[3:24:21] <PowerWeightedCell> not having prop shredder on one button really ruins DSD for me
[3:24:25] <Zombrocom> @MeGrimlock69 You dont do the stab in SSSS
[3:24:26] <+namillus> The SDT activation animation has mad iframes though.
[3:24:37] <+KSabot> jab auto parry is just a bit too easy
[3:24:45] <%joylent_blue> oh shit those jukes
[3:24:46] <shotgang86> Imagine being someone who misses Blitz
[3:24:48] <0rond> I think maybe activing SDT while in DT skips the stab
[3:24:48] <snootyhooty> use your ORA ORA against za wardo
[3:24:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Reminder that this chaos is teleporting
[3:24:49] <+KSabot> i feel cheap for using it against these bros
[3:24:55] <%TheFilth> this is a SDT room just to kill one of the fucks
[3:25:01] <Redbzerkr> why can't pat royal guard?
[3:25:02] <%ScreamingMeat> Boy, it sure is convenient the giant evil tree developed hearts in just the right places to activate the family Blood Fountain in the garden.
[3:25:04] <%lewdskeletor13> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[3:25:05] <almostkicking> blitz is so annoying on dante must die
[3:25:05] <+l3sovikk> Oh, thats the worst room in Son of Sparda
[3:25:06] <samiscoolbro> Fuck this enemy
[3:25:07] <%BrightOctarine> @AngriestPat You can break the red orbs with the swordmaster circle and keep running
[3:25:08] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[3:25:13] <+hardwiredfire> I love Furies just to Tricker fight them. Teleportation extravaganza!
[3:25:14] <+espresto> @espresto is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[3:25:14] <forgetme000> @AngriestPat what would you like added to Neros moveset if any in this or a future game
[3:25:14] <R3c0n31> S
[3:25:19] <Tucker0603> I AM A MANGO
[3:25:19] <brokenroberto> nice
[3:25:20] <$D4C_Trice> I respect your choice
[3:25:21] <%badchoice5> I AM OMEGA
[3:25:24] <%averyoddjew> i hate fury so much despite how much i like his design
[3:25:25] <Prism_Wing> Yo, that noctis tech lol
[3:25:25] <EBT93> Two Furies? Fuck that DansGame

[3:26:54] <%ScreamingMeat> @CSeriesJTYPE well the statue IS of Sparda holding the Rebellion, it opens a secrete entrance to the Sparda estate, AND it asks specifically for blood to open the way. Not sure why water wouldn't work
[3:26:56] <Zombrocom> Queens on SoS have RETARDED amounts of HP
[3:26:59] <SunsetJack> @AngriestPat In case you miss the info about Cavalier R, it is faster, has an extra move, has less hits and armor.
[3:26:59] <Dragon_Batman> It hits every thing on screen
[3:27:05] <%Plague_Nurse> Those queens are annoying as hell on dmd
[3:27:08] <+espresto> true, dante could canonically have DMC 1 weapons
[3:27:08] <InugamiTheHound> him doing that psycho crusher reminds of DT with alastor in DMC1
[3:27:12] <Hellarussian> just chillin
[3:27:16] <%TheFilth> he wanted to bang
[3:27:18] <mr_hunter> JUSTICE
[3:27:18] <%philoboy123> scratching his ass

[3:27:27] <Zombrocom> ?
[3:27:27] <Idon__> Sparda set everything up so that his sons would have sick ass fights later in life.
[3:27:27] <indig0bird> That's a story for DEVIL MAY CRY 6 BABY!
[3:27:28] <JayPastaForce> CBT justice
[3:27:28] <+espresto> oh wait no, I'm totally fucking wrong
[3:27:28] <televisedrevolt> He woke up to JUSTICE, man.
[3:27:29] <DaBigVitus> the night was starless and bible-black
[3:27:29] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hes probably depressed his wifes dead and is just sitting in a dark room somwhere.
[3:27:30] <conflict1914> what do you think about the old swordmaster moves being part of the core moveset now?
[3:27:30] <Goldenwolf98> He wanted to bang justice
[3:27:31] <Greywolf47> Sparda just wanted some piin
[3:27:31] <LixFury> @AngriestPat how do you do the old Swordmaster moves with DSD?
[3:27:32] <%Plague_Nurse> Jerking his bug peen on Mundus statues
[3:27:36] <%badchoice5> He's as sick of Dante vs Vergil as the rest of the squad, so he fucked off
[3:27:38] <%aishman> I do like that you can see and play why Dante is the LEGENDARY Devil Hunter
[3:27:38] <+Dovakhin573> Maybe Sparda is in heaven fighting angels and god like on some Spawn Shit Kappa
[3:27:44] <R3c0n31> Sparda was actually DINO the whole time
[3:27:46] <forgetme000> maybe he could see the future in some way
[3:27:47] <mr_ESB> DSD is really good so versatile
[3:27:55] <PowerWeightedCell> prop shredder on a combo DansGame
[3:27:57] <%ScreamingMeat> Like Nero
[3:27:59] <%Trinity5> prop shredder is on combo B
[3:28:13] <CSeriesJTYPE> well the entire premise of 3 is that Sparda used his demonic power to seal the door to the demon world through temen-ni-gru so
[3:28:13] <%TheFilth> I kinda wish it didn't make Sparda and Rebellion redundant
[3:28:15] <+espresto> does anyone else thing that the DSD design is kind of lame/bland?
[3:28:17] <+keksisblyat> I just real impact the orb crystals as Dante, makes it super easy
[3:28:17] <Idon__> a-ONE, a-TWO
[3:28:21] <+Papafleish> turbo tax is epic tax savings
[3:28:22] <Oqzar> no round trip tho
[3:28:23] <+espresto> I feel like rebellion is a cooler design
[3:28:24] <%Zaramoth> jesus
[3:28:27] <mr_ESB> Summon swords make combos sooo easy
[3:28:28] <+Dovakhin573> Oh i forgot this move, THATS DANTE in this game
[3:28:30] <%cappyd33> it is
[3:28:31] <+Tevvy> and holding triangle gets you summon swords outside of DT
[3:28:31] <grayjammer> HWOOOOW
[3:28:31] <%Plague_Nurse> Best sword in the game
[3:28:32] <SunsetJack> Roundtrip is still hold I guess?
[3:28:34] <conflict1914> caught
[3:28:35] <+Dovakhin573> in general
[3:28:36] <Zombrocom> Who needs round trip when you have Round Trips
[3:28:37] <%TheFilth> @Oqzar hold circle
[3:28:37] <%Trinity5> 4Head
[3:28:38] <Oqzar> new round trip is ok though
[3:28:47] <%aishman> So wonce you get Sparda, is Rebellion completely useless then?
[3:28:49] <$rytyoung> Too many...button combos...
[3:28:50] <DaBigVitus> THOSE STRIATIONS
[3:28:51] <beepleks> you can do quick drive as well if you swing once and quickly do the drive input
[3:28:51] <arcaderabbit48> How do you make him pole dance on his sword?
[3:28:52] <%ScreamingMeat> And now Round Trip is 4 summons swords that home in on targets after you hold O
[3:28:54] <conflict1914> roundtrip is actually back circle, and it uses your summoned swords
[3:28:54] <%lewdskeletor13> Dante getting his own sword is the coolest shit
[3:28:58] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Press any button to do cool thing
[3:28:58] <CSeriesJTYPE> @aishman they have the same moveset
[3:29:00] <+hardwiredfire> I've never like Nobodies but they i kind of like teh change they made in this from 1
[3:29:00] <OkamiDude15> @SunsetJack i think round trip gets replaced by the new summoned swords
[3:29:02] <%Trinity5> so are baphomets like the biggest jobbers
[3:29:06] <CalderGaming> @aishman the plot destroyed Rebellion
[3:29:08] <%Trinity5> because on SoS they're ezpz
[3:29:10] <Oqzar> also quick drive is gone
[3:29:12] <MeGrimlock69> absolutely
[3:29:13] <mr_ESB> Being able to store roundtrips Kreygasm
[3:29:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The freaking bouncing eyeball LUL
[3:29:16] <PowerWeightedCell> Rebellion is just a worse version of Sparda. Sparda has more reach on its melee than DSD and doesnt lock prop shredder behind a combo.
[3:29:16] <Gumbercules44> its almost like they made Dante WAY less antiquated
[3:29:17] <+namillus> @aishman Story-wise, Rebellion is broken when Dante gets Sparda. Once you beat the game you can use any of his swords though.
[3:29:19] <PowerWeightedCell> Otherwise DSD is best
[3:29:23] <SunsetJack> @OkamiDude15 I think it is still there since he has all the other moves.
[3:29:27] <EBT93> Bug whiff
[3:29:27] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[3:29:35] <EBT93> *big
[3:29:36] <%averyoddjew> does the rising dragon dt trick still work in 5?
[3:29:41] <gunzerkingdunce> Beat SoS and you can equip ALL the swords
[3:29:43] <+J_Papa> i tend to forget most of Dante's moves exist when i feel any amount of pressure
[3:29:52] <beepleks> @Oqzar nah, swing once then quickly do drive input = quick drive
[3:29:52] <%TheFilth> @averyoddjew distortion doesn't seem to be a thing
[3:29:56] <DaBigVitus> he's got aaaaaaaall this shit
[3:30:05] <mr_ESB> Back + SM style is prop for DSD
[3:30:06] <%aishman> Ah thanks guys.
[3:30:10] <+namillus> @gunzerkingdunce Or none of them
[3:30:12] <%FrustratedAF> if only we had elmig here
[3:30:16] <PowerWeightedCell> thats not prop thats high time @mr_ESB
[3:30:17] <Oqzar> you clearly didnt use it in 4 @beepleks
[3:30:23] <%averyoddjew> dam
[3:30:28] <%badchoice5> Well, he IS Omega
[3:30:31] <HazedNConfused> Pat, any tips for the stay in the air secret mission?
[3:30:36] <0rond> they had an entire style movest that they just slapped on DSD and gave him MORE MOVES to replace them!
[3:30:38] <CSeriesJTYPE> also I really like the implication that Sparda gave Vergil the Yamato as a fail-safe if he ever tried to use its power to split himself, and he gave Dante Rebellion in case Dante ever needed to stop Vergil
[3:30:39] <PowerWeightedCell> just spam cavalier air combo
[3:30:39] <DaBigVitus> he aint no tekken character
[3:30:40] <+namillus> @PowerWeightedCell It's High TimeS
[3:30:40] <MeGrimlock69> use cavaliere
[3:30:43] <%ScreamingMeat> Devil Sword Sparda feels kinda underpowered. It's just a slightly better version of Rebellion
[3:30:44] <dsauce999> NO RORBS
[3:30:44] <OkamiDude15> @badchoice5 but vergil is the alpha AND the omega woopsMB
[3:30:46] <gunzerkingdunce> @namillus exactly
[3:30:52] <talfurt> does the game ever say how vergil is alive after dmc1 but before he splits
[3:30:54] <Jane_Lo> @HazedNConfused i spammed cavalry there in the air, works perfectly
[3:30:55] <CalderGaming> @HazedNConfused use Cavaliere attacks and enemy step
[3:30:57] <Goldenwolf98> @HazedNConfused Use cavalier it keeps you in the air forever
[3:30:58] <silverback129> @hazednconfused I used Cavalier to stay a while
[3:31:00] <mr_ESB> You can use it after regular hightime which i love
[3:31:00] <Idon__> God, I hope doppel works better
[3:31:03] <Stardustphantom97> thoughts on 4 Dante compared to 5 Dante?
[3:31:04] <%joylent_blue> oh shit i forget about Doppelganger
[3:31:05] <Gumbercules44> its so crazy, you cannot kill him
[3:31:06] <+toilet_chan> will he get force edge
[3:31:07] <bleugh> vergil's got the bigger dick
[3:31:10] <Megapikman132> yee
[3:31:14] <%TheFilth> so glad they didn't give him a 5th style, made it so much more confusing
[3:31:15] <+Dovakhin573> I bet he will aslo have Sin DT
[3:31:16] <%aishman> But yeah, I like 'Wait why is Dante the Lgendar-Oh its cause he has the most moves, and weapons and is all around the most versatile"

[3:38:09] <ataxia72> the two BROTHAS
[3:38:09] <+TheoTTree> That mission is TOUGH to S-rank

[3:45:55] <MeowmereArt> @GarbageNirvana what works for me is to bind Gun into L1, and tap L2 with my left hand middle finger, you can try that set up. Also switch up your keybind, sometimes it's not the timing but its more about your comfort.

[3:49:48] <KohryuZX> Did Pat say anything about Judge Eyes being pulled from stores cause an actor in it was found doing COCAINE
[3:49:48] <NeonBleu> dante left?
[3:49:53] <%Hilleltaco> @HeadsHeldHigh Most people using spoiler moves are probably on Son of Sparda or higher as well, which I assume is different matchmaking alltogether
[3:49:56] <mak0t0yukii> Bjark is gone

[3:51:05] <%Keyd00d> EXPOSED
[3:51:05] <%machshop> @AngriestPat what is the difference between Crazy Talk and Talking Head?
[3:51:06] <troxcree> More charge shots
[3:51:07] <%joylent_blue> no way the whole game is getting scrapped
[3:51:08] <gunzerkingdunce> we need that Bloody Palace like now
[3:51:08] <%TheFilth> DMD teaches you to respect the enemy, or you're gonna have a bad time
[3:51:10] <Morning_Asakura> wait no judge eyes

[3:51:11] <Valdorick> So, does getting voted "Stylish" do? Bonus Orbs? Achievement? Sense of Accomplishment?
[3:51:13] <%MagickBurritoh> very Dismal
[3:51:14] <gustavozxd> good luck getting here with 3 players tough
[3:51:16] <Prism_Wing> This is why cocaine is bad.
[3:51:20] <ataxia72> yellow orbs @Valdorick
[3:51:22] <santystuffs> @Valdorick you get one golden orb
[3:51:24] <+chrishnaw> Just got here. Is this Bloody Palace?
[3:51:24] <%Trinity5> @Valdorick gold orbs for revives
[3:51:24] <MeGrimlock69> has anyone else noticed that Nero's dt heals WAY LESS than Dante's
[3:51:25] <+namillus> @Valdorick Anyone rated Stylish gets a Glorb.
[3:51:26] <OkamiDude15> @Valdorick yellow orb
[3:51:28] <shotgang86> aaaand thats why those guys are my first priority to kill
[3:51:31] <gunzerkingdunce> @valdorick gorbs
[3:51:34] <%Trinity5> @chrishnaw lol that's not out yet. this is a mission
[3:51:37] <%Big_Dream> Hey pat i dmd and that was hard but fun @\
[3:51:39] <%Hilleltaco> @gustavozxd Huh, yeah I guess that could happen with the ones that are just replay data. I thought it'd be different because the enemy arrangements are different
[3:51:40] <Valdorick> Baller! Thanks for the responses!
[3:51:44] <shotgang86> they always interrupt your combo with their super armor bullshit
[3:51:44] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat are ya winning, son?
[3:51:59] <Gumbercules44> charge that gun you bald FUCK
[3:52:05] <santystuffs> Be glad there isnt any Fury's on this mission

[3:52:17] <PranaPulse> nice ex-acting!
[3:52:18] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat what do think about nero getting a full devil trigger
[3:52:18] <%joylent_blue> not holding the gun button for charge shot 24/7 DansGame
[3:52:19] <gustavozxd> @hilleltaco yeah I thought that too, probably for a mission like this one, but in the end there's barely any multiplayer missions anyway
[3:52:20] <+fragdar> @AngriestPat yo pat.. gonna finish the game again today?
[3:52:22] <0rond> devil knuckle is crazy, to maximize damage with nero, you need to DT, combo with red queen, time your exceeds on each hit, time devil knuckles on every hit which has a different timing, AND SPAM THE GUN FOR SWORDS. can you say SKILL CEILING?
[3:52:22] <conflict1914> I wish Dante and V had a rainbow equivalent move
[3:52:31] <mak0t0yukii> Who needs arms anyways if you have the devil bringer hashOk
[3:52:35] <S2thec2theo2thet> Like those fucks from onimusa
[3:52:36] <%TheFilth> I don't think you fight a Fury as V
[3:52:37] <+0oki> how did he get so good with the exceed timing
[3:52:42] <%TheFilth> that'd be a nightmare
[3:52:43] <+BurkeBigsby> Son of Sparda?
[3:52:43] <%ScreamingMeat> "I like Wire Snatch better than Devil Snatch" Proceeds to use almost exclusively Devil Snatch
[3:52:45] <+TheoTTree> How much longer you reckon?
[3:52:48] <nobody12349> Where's your motivation?
[3:52:49] <%Trinity5> @0oki practice
[3:52:52] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @AngriestPat do you think you are better with nero or Dante?
[3:52:53] <%joylent_blue> 0oki lots of practice and time
[3:52:55] <%Trinity5> get motivated, kid
[3:52:55] <conflict1914> my guess is he just played the fuck out of 4
[3:53:03] <Idon__> SQUAD UP
[3:53:03] <mak0t0yukii> No co op pepeHands
[3:53:05] <%Trinity5> THE GANGS ALL HERE
[3:53:08] <+namillus> I don't think Wire Snatch and Devil Snatch are meaningfully different
[3:53:09] <+misterfistor> you can fight furies as v. counter with griffons sphere thing
[3:53:10] <%jiin6> The gangs all here
[3:53:11] <%Trinity5> THE GANG WEED CLAN
[3:53:12] <+0oki> guess I need to git good lol
[3:53:14] <%joylent_blue> exceed muscle memory is so nice to have
[3:53:14] <%J_Papa> I miss Nero's CRA-ZY when he did max act streak

[3:53:21] <+Dovakhin573> Im better with nero for sure
[3:53:22] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Yesss, birbman
[3:53:23] <shevan123> every cutscene is amazing
[3:53:23] <gustavozxd> the buster arm actually deals twice the damage from the bringer
[3:53:23] <fabnanman> LOL
[3:53:23] <SomeAsianDood> goddamn griffon gets me every time
[3:53:24] <%MrBorisMakarov> oh my god
[3:53:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yeyeyeye
[3:53:26] <troxcree> Everytime Griffon shows up is great.
[3:53:26] <Idon__> seamless transition
[3:53:28] <Idon__> didn't even notice it
[3:53:28] <%Trinity5> practice for exceed timing
[3:53:30] <conflict1914> this cutscene didn't make it in clearly
[3:53:31] <evbites> nero
[3:53:35] <Zombrocom> This scene got cut
[3:53:35] <DeebzNutz100> atpBird
[3:53:35] <%joylent_blue> Exceed timing takes practice
[3:53:37] <$GoogleyGareth> This scene wasn't in the main game
[3:53:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Great subtitles
[3:53:41] <%kiiiirsten> flap flap flap
[3:53:41] <+bdawg_3834> Pat lost 20 bucks on they max act taunt and then he had to go practice for a week lol
[3:53:42] <shotgang86> LUL
[3:53:42] <dazed_wanderer> like how subtitles just dissappeared there
[3:53:43] <person181> who even needs subs
[3:53:44] <santystuffs> Exceed is much more easier on 5
[3:53:44] <%hntronium> Remember guys, Pat doesn't lab
[3:53:45] <%Keyd00d> I wonder what they're going to do with V's playstyle going forward?
[3:53:46] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Whoa neat
[3:53:46] <+Odysseusftw> reverb act 3
[3:53:49] <%Hilleltaco> It just gets ingrained after a while
[3:53:51] <0rond> they also laxed the timing a lot more in 5
[3:53:52] <$GoogleyGareth> Wonder if anyone translated that
[3:53:56] <dsauce999> S
[3:53:57] <crystalrequiem> Wh---- what am I seeing here
[3:53:57] <+BurkeBigsby> So is Fury the new blitz?
[3:53:57] <%Trinity5> super sassy sexy!
[3:53:59] <+chrishnaw> DMCV for The Oscars
[3:53:59] <gunzerkingdunce> @keyd00d more stands
[3:54:02] <santystuffs> But can you Max Act the Air taunt? Kappa
[3:54:02] <CalderGaming> feels like there should be SS and SSS mission ranks
[3:54:04] <Gumbercules44> me and the boys during penis inspection day
[3:54:06] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> what in the world is this
[3:54:06] <+Tevvy> dont worry trying to get max acts and just try to get exceeds and you'll do fine
[3:54:08] <OkamiDude15> @BurkeBigsby yup
[3:54:08] <%Plague_Nurse> @AngriestPat if you do a mission with Dante without weapons and you lock-on, he does finger guns
[3:54:09] <0rond> if you are used to 4's exceed timing, 5 will be a lot easier
[3:54:10] <+dougrayman> what difficulty is on?
[3:54:11] <gooeychild> @AngriestPat So does the Devil cry at this game?
[3:54:15] <OkamiDude15> @dougrayman sos
[3:54:19] <Idon__> Also it doesn't have a giant fuck off laserbeam
[3:54:20] <evbites> nope
[3:54:21] <Stardustphantom97> Rawhide is great for parrying
[3:54:28] <%TheFilth> the only good boss rush in a dmc game
[3:54:28] <+TheoTTree> Blitz is also random as fuck so Fury is much better
[3:54:29] <KohryuZX> @AngriestPat Judge Eyes was completely pulles from stores cause of cocaine
[3:54:32] <$valriot> Blitz sucked
[3:54:37] <0rond> also fury has really low hp even higher difficulties, unlike blitz
[3:54:38] <%Trinity5> @gooeychild the devil makes it a point to explicitly not cry
[3:54:43] <gooeychild> i see
[3:54:45] <+ketchuo13> I find I'm good with getting max act on certain moves
[3:54:45] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @AngriestPat How do you deal with those teleporting red mother fuckers? they destroy me
[3:54:46] <%Trinity5> @gooeychild cause he ain't a binch
[3:54:47] <mayorrev> what's that timer in the background?
[3:54:47] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat have you done the Rawhide special animation against Malphas?
[3:54:51] <mayorrev> is that a clock?
[3:54:53] <+bdawg_3834> it has all the cool factor with non of the BS
[3:54:54] <gooeychild> @Trinity5 sounds good to me
[3:54:56] <bonzosan> blitz is cool to watch at a distance...
[3:54:56] <mayorrev> or is it recording time
[3:55:02] <b_ikki> yeah its lore time
[3:55:06] <%aishman> So, question. Why does V have tattooes?
[3:55:08] <%joylent_blue> crying doesn't make you crybaby, it does make you a little bitch though
[3:55:11] <%aishman> Does that mean VIRGIL has those tats?
[3:55:15] <shotgang86> SO HERE I AM
[3:55:16] <ataxia72> @santystuffs what do you mean? 👀
[3:55:18] <%Agami23> i love what woolie said about blitz and find that it fits really well with fury too. that if a battle is a sentence, a blitz and a fury is a period.
[3:55:19] <%TheFilth> @aishman they house his demons
[3:55:20] <DragonCelt> so...V is the missing AFI member?
[3:55:22] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @aishman They are the demons he summons
[3:55:23] <%Trinity5> @joylent_blue kittens cry MEOW puppies cry WOOF
[3:55:27] <%ElenaManetta> Go buy it on Etsy
[3:55:32] <T_Sasquatch> Dogs cry woof, cats cry meow
[3:55:33] <Idon__> Someone cap me in the knee so I can get a cane like V's
[3:55:33] <mayorrev> Pat just wants an excuse to have a cane
[3:55:34] <$GoogleyGareth> You're gonna need one soon old man.
[3:55:34] <%joylent_blue> aishman they're a representation of the pact he has with his familiars, thats all
[3:55:34] <+TheoTTree> V's tats have the ink he uses for his summons
[3:55:35] <+plzdodge> What's the next CapGod game/announcement, mines God Hand HD or Viewtiful Joe Trilogy for the Switch
[3:55:37] <Prevot> his cane is also a cane?
[3:55:38] <%J_Papa> I wonder what finishing Goliath looks like if you dont rescue nightmare for his fight
[3:55:39] <reonome> just split yourself into your human side and demon side
[3:55:39] <+chrishnaw> V's cane would come up to your chest, Pat
[3:55:41] <+advoccat> @AngriestPat will you play DMD after this run?
[3:55:41] <+HunterInABox> When I'm old I hope to have a cane that cool
[3:55:43] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> just become a Blue Mage
[3:55:44] <%TheFilth> @aishman I think they're meant to be his memories as Nelo Angelo
[3:55:45] <%Zaramoth> Canes are cool until you actually require them to walk
[3:55:45] <santystuffs> @ataxia72 you can use the snatch on her when she is going through portals and bring her to you, Nero yells out "LETS GO FOR A WALK LITTLE CHICKEE"
[3:55:46] <DarkSideCow> his tats are the demons
[3:55:46] <%ElenaManetta> I don't know, I just assume every cosplay thing is on Etsy
[3:55:48] <%thewildzubat> I want a spin off game that's just Tony Hawk Pro Skater, but it's just V
[3:55:50] <+dougrayman> in a few more years you gonna have to use one... so it balances out
[3:55:50] <@Mechz71> what do you plan on needing a cane in the near future?
[3:55:50] <dazed_wanderer> does V's cane have any lore?
[3:55:51] <mak0t0yukii> You're gonna need one anyways LUL
[3:55:52] <%lloyddboy> CORE VALUES
[3:55:53] <TakesGuts> this game ending is more like Devil May Smile
[3:55:53] <%MagickBurritoh> hot
[3:55:54] <Zombrocom> Nightmare is gone,, so white hair
[3:55:54] <copyritetm> Ok so the real question is what even is Malphas
[3:55:58] <ataxia72> oh my god that's the ebst thanks santy
[3:55:59] <MKII> goodbye tattoo demons
[3:56:00] <$valriot> Youd probably need to cut it in half though Kappa
[3:56:00] <%superc37> Wait, what happens if you fight Goliath first without nightmare?
[3:56:01] <Idon__> YES
[3:56:01] <Megapikman132> V can totally parry with his cane, btw
[3:56:02] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Let Paige watch as you stream beg for people to pay for your V cape
[3:56:04] <gustavozxd> @aishman it's the same reason his hair is black, I don't remember very well
[3:56:04] <ataxia72> oh my god that's the best thanks santy
[3:56:05] <+HunterInABox> Watching you suffer would be fun
[3:56:08] <%aishman> SEKIROOO
[3:56:09] <Idon__> I'd hella watch that
[3:56:11] <%Keyd00d> Sekiro in one week!
[3:56:13] <%superc37> the finisher, I mean
[3:56:13] <derekwst3> I accidently grabbed nightmare first with this not understanding what was happening
[3:56:16] <Zombrocom> @superc37 He just does a generic finisher it's super lame
[3:56:16] <%TheFilth> @superc37 you get a generic finisher
[3:56:17] <%hntronium> Maybe the first 30 minutes of your suffering would be fine
[3:56:19] <gunzerkingdunce> I think V can exist as his own given that his familiars fight has his cane floating in the back
[3:56:19] <%enkaisu> DMD would be really fun to watch, always down for more DMC streams in general
[3:56:20] <b_ikki> of course
[3:56:20] <+sergeantsuperbeast> @aishman the demons are stored in his tattoos. if you pay attention youll notice he's tatoo-less if he has all 3 out. Shadow and Nightmare are his body tattoos and Nightmare's stored in the tattoos on V's hair which is naturally white
[3:56:20] <LiquidMathew> Knowing about Nightmare being his hair makes this part make so much more sense
[3:56:21] <%Plague_Nurse> yup
[3:56:21] <+advoccat> i'd watch DMD run
[3:56:22] <%Trinity5> wait can he?
[3:56:24] <%Trinity5> oh shit
[3:56:25] <$GoogleyGareth> GOD I hate this room
[3:56:26] <%J_Papa> Fight Goliath without Nightmare!
[3:56:27] <chikensandwich> dmd is kind EZ
[3:56:27] <%joylent_blue> does it though
[3:56:27] <%NWR_James> Everything is now different
[3:56:28] <silvcrest> Small window, but it can
[3:56:29] <person181> new tech
[3:56:30] <+HeadsHeldHigh> when's tenchu
[3:56:30] <+TheoTTree> Maybe just try it out and drop it if it doesn't go good? I'd personally like to see it tried
[3:56:31] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> oh yeah
[3:56:31] <%aishman> Oooh huh, that's interesting.
[3:56:32] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat you can Jump cancel the cane too and farm DT
[3:56:32] <+namillus> @AngriestPat wild speculation follows: Someone noticed that the head of V's cane has a symbol on it that resembles the markings on Luce & Ombra, Sparda's old pistols, so I suspect it used to be Old Man Sparda's and V grabbed it after the split.
[3:56:36] <+HotBloodedHero> hard timing
[3:56:37] <Megapikman132> I saw footage of him doing it here, against each of these bosses.
[3:56:39] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> ALL in favor of DMD say I lmao
[3:56:39] <+keksisblyat> In the gallery l, Nico’s weapon report says that there’s nothing special about V’s cane other than it being a good conducted of demon energy
[3:56:39] <conflict1914> this is a weird level, no combat besides 3 bosses
[3:56:39] <+fragdar> @AngriestPat gonna early stream sekiro? ou just gonna play on day 1?
[3:56:39] <%ScreamingMeat> Etsy has a bunch of cool looking Canes. They have the Sly Cooper Cane too
[3:56:44] <%MagickBurritoh> KH
[3:56:44] <%aishman> Also @AngriestPat Hows Division 2?
[3:56:48] <+timblenaut> there's a video of V parrying vergil's devil trigger on the subreddit
[3:56:48] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> shit i forgot about sekiro
[3:56:48] <%ECRead> you give me enough time, I'll figure out how to make V's cane
[3:56:50] <mr_slaide> The virgin V.
[3:56:51] <+megaryanx> what platform are you getting for sekiro?
[3:56:53] <gogoszy> Ive watched a couple of dmd steams. Not interested g.
[3:56:54] <ataxia72> I fought Goliath without Nightmare my first time so when I got the Goliath animation on my second attempt it was hype as fuck
[3:56:55] <+namillus> @conflict1914 This is this game's "boss rush"
[3:56:55] <Valdorick> Demon lady, why would you have a dimension he HAS to walk through that also heals him?
[3:56:56] <+ketchuo13> @conflict1914 Well this is V's final level
[3:56:56] <gustavozxd> cavalier is probably not a good idea for the first fight
[3:57:00] <%Trinity5> just have Man At Arms make V's cane
[3:57:01] <%Keyd00d> nice
[3:57:01] <derekwst3> grab nightmare first and use the cane to attack
[3:57:07] <%Trinity5> if they could also make blue rose that would be cool

[3:57:14] <+advoccat> pepeHands
[3:57:14] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I honestly feel like freeing Nightmare first might actually be the best thing to do

[3:57:16] <%Trinity5> SourPls
[3:57:16] <%joylent_blue> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:57:23] <ataxia72> this boss rush with V is awesome
[3:57:23] <Goldenwolf98> I freed nightmare first my first time doing this so I had to beat the boss to death with my cane LUL
[3:57:29] <+misterfistor> what a good ass bost bgm

[3:57:31] <mak0t0yukii> THE GOOD KIND OF DUBSTEP hashAww

[3:57:38] <%Trinity5> SoS
[3:57:39] <%joylent_blue> yes Jjnajjohnson
[3:57:40] <T_Sasquatch> sos
[3:57:40] <%ScreamingMeat> This must be such a huge pain in the ass if you get Griffon or Nightmare first
[3:57:44] <dmysta3000> I fucking love this theme
[3:57:44] <Evilkaz> What song is this called in the OST chat?
[3:57:46] <televisedrevolt> Pat knows he can hit him with his cane and it'll do decent damage right?
[3:57:47] <Zombrocom> This theme is so strange but so good
[3:57:52] <abakkus> not over how hype this track is
[3:57:52] <+BurkeBigsby> Son of sparda damage is so cute after playing DmD.
[3:57:53] <Hellarussian> this is rough
[3:57:53] <Cranky_Construct> Faded Tone's the track name
[3:57:56] <Idon__> I'm so surprised Cavalier Angelo isn't Alastor
[3:57:56] <Zombrocom> @Evilkaz Faded Tone
[3:57:57] <foxhounder29> @angriestpat WHERE IS JAAAAAAAA
[3:57:57] <%Nobrev> @Trinity5 man at arms is dead because the company that owned their channel went under. the BKS guys have their own channel now called That Works
[3:57:58] <T_Sasquatch> i had to restart because i picked griffon first
[3:57:59] <%Trinity5> this is one of those "fight scenes in a club" track
[3:58:02] <%joylent_blue> ScreamingMeat as someone who picked Griffon first my first playthrough, yes, yes it is :)
[3:58:02] <Jjnajjohnson> thnx @joylentblue
[3:58:05] <Evilkaz> thanks
[3:58:07] <spinbel> What's the ghost data for this mission for?
[3:58:11] <%Trinity5> @Nobrev shit i was not aware. Thanks for the info!
[3:58:14] <OkamiDude15> i feel like we need a big block of text saying the difficulty on the top right on the screen sfhTHINK
[3:58:16] <%Hilleltaco> @derekwst3 Nah he's just colored like that
[3:58:18] <Goldenwolf98> Why did you start against Angelo?
[3:58:20] <santystuffs> @spinbel mission 15 and 16
[3:58:20] <+misterfistor> throw some dt into shadow
[3:58:21] <0rond> the spike deals a lot of damage
[3:58:21] <%Trinity5> @Nobrev are all those old videos still up though?
[3:58:27] <+Jerkweed> the cane can parry him
[3:58:27] <T_Sasquatch> or pat could change his title to sos
[3:58:28] <+namillus> You pretty much gotta pick Shadow first here, I think.
[3:58:32] <%Nobrev> @Trinity5 I believe they are
[3:58:33] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I freed Griffon first and I actually found fighting the Knight easier because Blockage pierces his guard
[3:58:36] <%joylent_blue> i feel like Goliath first with Shadow is ideal
[3:58:36] <+namillus> Otherwise V can't properly move around
[3:58:39] <%Trinity5> that's good, at least
[3:58:40] <GandhiTheTerrible> juice that kitty
[3:58:43] <gustavozxd> my order is always shadow/goliath Griffin/Artemis and nightmare/cavalier
[3:58:49] <foxhounder29> is ja rule going to show up on stream?
[3:58:51] <+misterfistor> read some poetry
[3:58:53] <Idon__> I think I heard someone told me the bosses take normal damage from V's cane in this part?
[3:58:53] <phoenix_games87> i find that fighting artemis first with grifon is the easier start
[3:58:57] <T_Sasquatch> WHERE IS JA ?
[3:58:57] <derekwst3> @Hilleltaco no you can do damage to him with the cane, I know because I accidently grabbed nightmare first
[3:58:57] <ataxia72> not looking forward to this fight on DMD, he beat my ass on SOS (though I also just played pretty poorly)
[3:58:57] <+jkobe34> cant you damage these bosses with the cane?
[3:58:57] <mak0t0yukii> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:58:59] <CSeriesJTYPE> WHERE'S JA

[3:59:10] <+misterfistor> reeeead
[3:59:10] <gustavozxd> Shadow's back forward move deals insane amounts of damage
[3:59:14] <Goldenwolf98> @jkobe34 yep
[3:59:21] <copyritetm> is this on SoS?
[3:59:22] <+TheoTTree> Shadow vs Goliath, Griffon vs Cavaliere then Nightmare vs Artemis was my pick. Artemis was rough
[3:59:26] <%TheFilth> that can be pretty jarring
[3:59:29] <%Hilleltaco> @derekwst3 Oh really? Sorry. That's cool though, I never noticed
[3:59:29] <%Ion_LaserX> @copyritetm yeah
[3:59:29] <%cappyd33> i love this theme
[3:59:30] <evbites> i'm really disappointed] by the announcer dlc i thought it would be classic scales as well
[3:59:31] <foxhounder29> NO NO IT AIN'T FRAUD -Ja Rule
[3:59:31] <chikensandwich> sould have got grifon first
[3:59:32] <Redbzerkr> can you not read the book right now?
[3:59:34] <%joylent_blue> why are they even here this level
[3:59:36] <artoflec> i used Skewer it does so much damage
[3:59:37] <%ElenaManetta> Sometimes Pat goes into a video game trance and I feel like he forgets we're here.

[3:59:44] <0rond> @AngriestPat do you think it's a missed opportunity that V's cane isn't the yamato, with urizen's shield being yamato's sheath? would have been great since vergil uses the sheath to block and the sword to hit

[4:00:33] <Valdorick> But those Rorbs are needed to buy EX Provocation! RIP those Rorbs
[4:00:34] <%claybore> claybore subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Love watching you and Miss Saliba gargle balls live on stream. Keep up the good work.
[4:00:34] <CSeriesJTYPE> I have my network settings off
[4:00:39] <+BurkeBigsby> Isn't there like no penalty difference to using a gorb to revive compared to rorbs?

[4:00:44] <%joylent_blue> of the following contraries, these are true
[4:00:45] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> it almost looked like you died
[4:00:45] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat you can hurt these guys with the cane
[4:00:48] <mayorrev> Paige would make a great V. Pale, fragile, and has an evil cat
[4:00:48] <+chrishnaw> You. Did it.
[4:00:51] <ataxia72> I love V's line when finishing off Geryon
[4:00:51] <Stardustphantom97> Scrub tax
[4:00:56] <+TheoTTree> Kill
[4:00:56] <Zombrocom> Checkmate is the finisher
[4:00:57] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat the last hit with the cane
[4:00:57] <OkamiDude15> the kill move
[4:00:57] <Megapikman132> just the cane
[4:00:58] <televisedrevolt> Pat you can hit them with your cane.
[4:00:58] <%joylent_blue> the kill
[4:00:58] <%cappyd33> the cane
[4:00:59] <%Nobrev> when you kill them
[4:00:59] <Evilkaz> Goliath vs Nighmare
[4:00:59] <AlexanderTheConquerer> V's finisher
[4:01:00] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Checkmate is cane
[4:01:01] <+namillus> @BurkeBigsby "Used A Gold Orb" is a x0.8 score modifier
[4:01:01] <conflict1914> the cane kill
[4:01:01] <pwnhills> You need nightmare for it
[4:01:08] <OkamiDude15> you need nightmare
[4:01:09] <SsHomes> i feel like v would've benefited from a melee counter attack
[4:01:10] <JamvaanPS4> I like how this scene in the game was completely hidden in the trailers but the animations were still shown off.
[4:01:10] <+d00msdaydan> the kaiju battle
[4:01:11] <artoflec> lmao i didnt know that was called checkmate either
[4:01:14] <%mitchteck> Hey does anyone know how you get the extra mission photos
[4:01:16] <Megapikman132> oh! Promotion
[4:01:17] <CSeriesJTYPE> like RTSS will say that im only at 33% GPU use and my framerate wont go above 50 in certain areas
[4:01:21] <Goldenwolf98> Why is he leaving the easiest boss for last?
[4:01:22] <ataxia72> hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom, no clock can measure. DIE.
[4:01:23] <televisedrevolt> Pat these bosses actually take damage from your cane.
[4:01:28] <phoenix_games87> i got it its pretty cool
[4:01:30] <+plzdodge> What do you think is the next CapGod announcement? Mine's Dark Void 2 or Operation Raccoon City 2
[4:01:33] <%alexandrecau> what is the finisher without nightmare? always had him against goliath
[4:01:33] <+chrishnaw> BIRD SQUAD UP
[4:01:35] <GandhiTheTerrible> @ataxia72 that's the best one
[4:01:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> and on the one mission in the train station it legit runs in slow motion at times
[4:01:37] <televisedrevolt> That's why they're white.
[4:01:40] <ataxia72> it's so good
[4:01:40] <OkamiDude15> @mitchteck its a post game thing but you get the second photo for S ranking the mission
[4:01:40] <person181> bird up

[4:01:53] <+namillus> I'm pretty disappointed V doesn't have unique lines for Artemis or Griffon but the animations are cool
[4:02:00] <+TheoTTree> Artemis is ROUGH
[4:02:03] <GandhiTheTerrible> <3 you,birb
[4:02:04] <%ScreamingMeat> What finisher do you use against Goliath if you get Griffon instead of Nightmare?
[4:02:04] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[4:02:05] <%alexandrecau> oh less cool
[4:02:05] <%J_Papa> @mitchteck beat the game first then they start unlocking when you beat bosses
[4:02:06] <gustavozxd> JC with the cane is crazy in these fights
[4:02:10] <Naixoram> @AngriestPat did you see V's finisher for Vergil?
[4:02:15] <+TheoTTree> WOW the damage
[4:02:17] <%TheFilth> @ScreamingMeat generic finisher
[4:02:18] <+TheoTTree> jesus fuck

[4:02:25] <Valdorick> Destroyed
[4:02:26] <%Trinity5> damn that was sick
[4:02:27] <+BurkeBigsby> Auto pilot minions= book time.
[4:02:28] <person181> quick
[4:02:30] <Idon__> ouch
[4:02:30] <%ElenaManetta> that should be s my man
[4:02:34] <+plzdodge> V's NUMBER IS SO BIG
[4:02:38] <%ScreamingMeat> V just trivializes Artemis
[4:02:39] <GandhiTheTerrible> griffon is awesome
[4:02:39] <shotgang86> V is easy mode
[4:02:42] <%joylent_blue> V's finisher for Vergil is fucking sick
[4:02:43] <+chrishnaw> V is very strong
[4:02:47] <+redascendant1> What is that thing on the side that says "starring" and has other player names?
[4:02:50] <SomersaultJustice> it's like the dog from wild guns reloaded
[4:02:50] <+TheoTTree> Well FUCK ME I guess lol Artemis was big trouble for me because I didn't abuse the autopilot LUL
[4:02:51] <DatGreyMind> V has a finisher for Vergil? PogChamp
[4:02:51] <mr_slaide> But is it stronger than Jiren?
[4:02:54] <%Trinity5> @joylent_blue you mean with the mod?
[4:02:55] <Idon__> If they ever retcon V back, I hope he can switch out demons like Dante can switch out arms.
[4:02:57] <santystuffs> I found out you can Jump Cancel his cane today, you get lots of DT back by doing it
[4:03:00] <%ElenaManetta> Is V supposed to play like that. Is he supposed to in-world be this powerful compared to the rest.
[4:03:00] <%akingofnoobs> how do u fight vergil as V?
[4:03:01] <LiquidMathew> Vergil was also OP in dmc3, V is just continuing the tradition
[4:03:02] <%alexandrecau> ganging 3 on 1 is really good guys
[4:03:02] <%TheFilth> there's gotta be some bosses that won't be in Bloody Palace, like Gilgamesh
[4:03:02] <+IntegratedPaper> Pat you better parry Cavaliere with V's cane, like a real chad
[4:03:03] <%MagickBurritoh> not having to fight yourself is very strong
[4:03:06] <%joylent_blue> Trinity5 he has animation for bloody palace vergil, look it up
[4:03:06] <CSeriesJTYPE> @redascendant1 other players doing the same mission
[4:03:08] <+namillus> I mean, when V doesn't have Nightmare, what else are you gonna do with your DT
[4:03:11] <Coreagrus> I honestly don't like the auto-pilot. Keep that shit in automatic mode.
[4:03:15] <mak0t0yukii> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[4:03:17] <%Trinity5> @joylent_blue alright sick. that's gonna be fun
[4:03:20] <+BurkeBigsby> On DmD i find V's enemies to be aslog to fight. Especially the Nelo angelo's. Their HP is absurd.
[4:03:22] <+SCnightblade> Damn, you're on Auto right?
[4:03:25] <ataxia72> this is the best V mission imo
[4:03:25] <Idon__> God, I love the bodysplash so much
[4:03:26] <InfiniteSwagbito> V has trouble in DMD
[4:03:27] <+redascendant1> @CSeriesJTYPE Are you supposed to be competing with them or something?
[4:03:29] <ataxia72> these fights are just super fun
[4:03:30] <%ElenaManetta> Kind of CLOSE THERE PATRICK
[4:03:31] <foxhounder29> billy where's the water?
[4:03:37] <GandhiTheTerrible> nightmare's body slam is so derpy LUL
[4:03:40] <%ScreamingMeat> I don't think the Book works when Nightmare is out Pat
[4:03:41] <+SCnightblade> @InfiniteSwagbito YES HE DOES
[4:03:43] <%Trinity5> @joylent_blue i meant to ask how people found that animation lmao
[4:03:47] <%Trinity5> but that's great
[4:03:48] <shotgang86> oof
[4:03:49] <%TheFilth> oof
[4:03:51] <InfiniteSwagbito> In terms of character capabilities, Dante's on top with Nero in 2nd, then V in third. DMD fucking shreds V
[4:03:53] <GandhiTheTerrible> o o f
[4:03:53] <+chrishnaw> F
[4:03:53] <LiquidMathew> Easy mode is now selectable
[4:03:54] <MeGrimlock69> BRUH
[4:03:54] <%MagickBurritoh> Gorb
[4:03:55] <CSeriesJTYPE> @redascendant1 nah the game just shows you what Dante and Nero are doing but instead of AI it actually connects you to real players
[4:03:55] <%ElenaManetta> EASY MODE
[4:03:56] <+jkobe34> @DatGreyMind yeah someonemodded the final boss and found it
[4:03:56] <%badchoice5> @ScreamingMeat it does
[4:03:56] <%lloyddboy> oof

[4:05:04] <%TheFilth> I wish Nightmare was always that size
[4:05:04] <horny_guts> PogChamp
[4:05:04] <%Trinity5> it looks p cool
[4:05:10] <%Zaramoth> its the Fade
[4:05:10] <abakkus> just run straight for that monster crotch
[4:05:11] <person181> and now V is dead
[4:05:13] <%Zaramoth> but for DMC
[4:05:13] <GandhiTheTerrible> it's kinda rough
[4:05:14] <%joylent_blue> its short at least
[4:05:15] <mr_slaide> The virgin V.
[4:05:15] <%ElenaManetta> I love it when the screen goes to white and gives Pat's room a god light for a second
[4:05:15] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat Why does V say "Return my UNDERwear" so much? I don't get it
[4:05:16] <%Trinity5> well it's a V boss rush, what can you do
[4:05:17] <%MrBorisMakarov> its fine
[4:05:17] <+namillus> @T_Sasquatch Bloody Palace footage
[4:05:23] <%luckevalentine> Its terrible on DMD
[4:05:24] <LiquidMathew> Pat you don't like this mission because your balls just got exposed on stream
[4:05:24] <shotgang86> its a taste of Bloody Palace with V
[4:05:25] <%iwishthiswasicq> I do wish V had a better final mission.
[4:05:26] <%ScreamingMeat> But Pat, what if you need those Gorbs later!?
[4:05:27] <Zombrocom> I like that he gets to fight the bosses he didn't fight
[4:05:29] <ataxia72> this mission owns imo but I bet it sucks on DMD
[4:05:29] <+BurkeBigsby> It's the laziest mission by far.
[4:05:29] <gustavozxd> it's pretty easy if you have a proper order you're comfortable with
[4:05:31] <gunzerkingdunce> so you have finish goliath with nightmare out for that animation?
[4:05:32] <+chrishnaw> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[4:05:32] <foxhounder29> is ja rule the final boss?
[4:05:33] <%nmaten> the game really starts running out of steam in the second half till vergil imo
[4:05:34] <AlexanderTheConquerer> is griffon also rocket raccoon
[4:05:37] <dmysta3000> Its a better Boss Rush than the other games at least
[4:05:37] <testament19> this game wishes it could be as cool as DMC3
[4:05:40] <%alexandrecau> malphas live action?
[4:05:40] <santystuffs> The fact you cant get to S easily while the Nero and Dante from mission 15 and 16 have it more fun
[4:05:45] <%TheFilth> yes, Cavalier was made for Nero
[4:05:49] <T_Sasquatch> i like it
[4:05:51] <%starotter70> Music's good at least
[4:05:53] <%Trinity5> wait so do you want to play MORE or LESS as V
[4:05:54] <Idon__> Bloody Palace is gonna be so good for V
[4:05:54] <%Rngiddion> on dmd that is more of a blessing
[4:05:55] <LiquidMathew> V doesn't really get that good of bosses
[4:05:56] <CptBritches> Sounds like you won't like Bloody Palace with V
[4:05:59] <ataxia72> my only problem with this mission is getting these orbs sucks
[4:06:00] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Malphas should have gone to V honestly.
[4:06:00] <PowerWeightedCell> honestly everything in this game would be made for nero too if they didnt add the parries to most threatening enemies
[4:06:01] <FenixSeraph> "We weren't sure you'd like the new kid, so just in case"
[4:06:01] <TheBlankAce> They were probably a little scared people wouldn't like him

[4:06:32] <+Anonylesssss> @joylent_blue thanks!
[4:06:32] <+SCnightblade> One is his, one is Nero's, one is Dante's
[4:06:32] <CSeriesJTYPE> im disappointed that most of the missions in this game are just A to B enemy gauntlets
[4:06:33] <VRNK> @AngriestPat you have to kill your time clone
[4:06:33] <gunzerkingdunce> Nidhogg was pretty cool
[4:06:36] <ataxia72> it took me like four runs to get the porb in here, it was the last collectible I needed
[4:06:37] <+chimaera24> @AngriestPat I wouldn't be surprised ifthe devs were worried about giving too many missions to V with his weird playstyle
[4:06:38] <%alexandrecau> because his bosses suck, nidhogg and geryon are lame compared to the other bosses
[4:06:40] <+TheoTTree> I wonder if we'll see people experimenting a lot with V as this game progresses
[4:06:40] <RyanGelatin> just started watching, is this the end of the game
[4:06:43] <novusboi> Like I would love to see capcom iterate on his play style
[4:06:45] <%Trinity5> As the air to a bird or the sea to a fish-
[4:06:47] <dmysta3000> Pat has come to help Pat
[4:06:49] <dsauce999> TERRIBLE DANTE DOOD

[4:06:50] <T_Sasquatch> @CSeriesJTYPE as opposed to ?
[4:06:51] <+TheoTTree> For example the fucker has ENEMY STEP. Why?
[4:06:52] <Skullamancer> I wish he got some cool Vergil stuff after you beat the game like Nero’s DT and Dante having Sparta and Rebellion
[4:06:59] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[4:06:59] <chikensandwich> i feel like he has way more than nero
[4:07:00] <fbi4ever> Red orbs farming exploits still on ?
[4:07:01] <InfiniteSwagbito> Pat stabbed himself with the Yamato to create Paige, the Pat we see before us is his pure demon form
[4:07:02] <%TheFilth> @ataxia72 same, I only noticed it doing Nero's mission

[4:07:08] <Dragon_Batman> It makes sense in the grand scheme of things.
[4:07:09] <gustavozxd> what would V be called if they used KH naming convention for nobodies?
[4:07:09] <%Hilleltaco> There's no V figure I guess
[4:07:11] <%joylent_blue> that was so weird
[4:07:11] <RyanGelatin> "my journey is coming to an end" just as i say that lmao
[4:07:14] <CSeriesJTYPE> @T_Sasquatch older DMC games had puzzles and platforming sections, sometimes a combination of the two, in between combat
[4:07:14] <Dragon_Batman> What would you use for V
[4:07:15] <fabnanman> loll
[4:07:16] <Prism_Wing> There is no V toy, I guess lol.

[4:11:38] <%Hilleltaco> The grabs on those floating enemies are some of my favorite ever
[4:11:39] <%madhattergay> @AngriestPat ive been listening to devil trigger on repeat for the last 4 days
[4:11:41] <gustavozxd> forgetting overture LUL
[4:11:41] <%yoshkosh20> so nero can still use the breakers by making his new arm incorporeal or something, right?
[4:11:44] <%Trinity5> SourPls

[4:11:52] <+neonNeptunian> aaaaw yeah!

[4:11:56] <rekinom> Can we get a clip of Nico saying Nico nico niiiiiii ?
[4:11:57] <CSeriesJTYPE> the level design is really good I just wish it was actually broken up with the puzzle elements that the old games had

[4:12:21] <%badchoice5> I wonder if they actually just knew Nero's song was the most popular and made it play more
[4:12:23] <+chrishnaw> Das a good one too

[4:12:27] <CSeriesJTYPE> pull MY POWER trigger

[4:12:36] <Swaron__> pull my devil ni-
[4:12:36] <0rond> yeah this level is basically, "let's shove all the platforming,puzzles, and timing challenges of a normal dmc game to one level
[4:12:39] <%iwishthiswasicq> Nico is basically Alphis if she was cool.
[4:12:45] <+neonNeptunian> DUNKED
[4:12:47] <santystuffs> I wonder if they went to the trouble of making it a normal slapping sound after giving Nero's arm back
[4:12:49] <%Trinity5> bah god
[4:12:50] <novusboi> I don’t like that his theme straight up doesn’t play in some missions
[4:12:54] <SolaireSunbro> all of Dante's music fits better imo
[4:13:06] <gustavozxd> this part of the level is weird because these angelos don't fight if you don't attack them
[4:13:07] <0rond> this section is really weird
[4:13:12] <0rond> you can just jump over them
[4:13:15] <Goldenwolf98> These Dark Souls door blocking knights LUL

[4:14:37] <mayorrev> SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT
[4:14:38] <+BurkeBigsby> DLC gerbera is so much fun
[4:14:39] <+zaworldo> o
[4:14:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> it was cancelled @zaworldo
[4:14:40] <abakkus> @zaworldo they didn't record this week bc sick
[4:14:41] <Leebrownie> naw fuck buster arm NG+
[4:14:43] <%alexandrecau> @zaworldo cancelled pat was sick all week

[4:14:53] <+zaworldo> today
[4:14:53] <%joylent_blue> i didnt even realize the DLC Gerbera had a different animation until i accidentally used it against vergil
[4:14:57] <PsychoFlash1> has pat max-acted the air taunt yet?
[4:15:02] <+SuichiTanaka> Snow Plow~
[4:15:03] <gustavozxd> buster arm deals more damage than the bringer
[4:15:04] <+NekoNinja13> we need a megaman action game...
[4:15:08] <%Trinity5> dlc gerbera makes for great gifs
[4:15:10] <+Cryghoul> where tf is this area
[4:15:12] <OkamiDude15> @PsychoFlash1 he did it earlier in the stream
[4:15:15] <Morning_Asakura> @PsychoFlash1 many times
[4:15:15] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, he MaxActed the air taunt earlier
[4:15:17] <+namillus> @Leebrownie Buster Arm actually has a use even though Nero can do it, and that's that its grabs are oneshots
[4:15:17] <gunzerkingdunce> @angriestpat DMC5 Spoilercast next week?
[4:15:19] <0rond> i think buster arm does like, triple the damage?
[4:15:23] <%Trinity5> up trick to down trick on dlc gerbera is slow mo gif bait
[4:15:25] <+neonNeptunian> SURPER SEKSI
[4:15:25] <PsychoFlash1> @OkamiDude15 @Morning_Asakura nice!
[4:15:26] <majindusto> Pat, stop getting sick...I need my podcast fix :(
[4:15:30] <+chrishnaw> Sick Skills!
[4:15:34] <%thewildzubat> is there any reason to use the Buster Arm on NG+?
[4:15:34] <Graxe_> @ChunLoArt It's all about movement. Neutral inputs aren't standing shockwaves, they either launch you up or down, along with nearby enemies.
[4:15:34] <%J_Papa> Hard Way absolutely rules, its like a true gap closer without knockback but puts you into position to juggle
[4:15:35] <%b00ls> super sexy Kreygasm
[4:15:39] <%Trinity5> YOU ARE ALL DUMB NOW
[4:15:39] <%badchoice5> Great timing on the song fadeout

[4:15:49] <+sherndon226> Pat it's ok to be sick
[4:15:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 15m.
[4:15:51] <%joylent_blue> its ok man GivePLZ
[4:15:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> PAT ITS FINE
[4:15:52] <Tetsu_TIW> buster arm does double damage on regular grabs, and like 10x damage on the breakage compared to DT buster
[4:15:55] <+TheoTTree> Don't be sorry for being sick <34
[4:15:55] <GandhiTheTerrible> s'cool dude. get better <3
[4:15:57] <abakkus> I'm usually an episode behind so now I can catch up, thanks Pat's immune system
[4:15:57] <Leebrownie> @namillus it's preference I know but i'd rather have the added utility and just rely on a weaker throw than lose a spot for the higher damage
[4:15:58] <gustavozxd> don't be sorry Pat come on lol it's fine
[4:15:59] <%badchoice5> @AngriestPat Your mortality is really inconvenient for me Pat
[4:16:01] <%TheFilth> he overdosed on style
[4:16:01] <+chrishnaw> Eat more vegetables
[4:16:02] <Raldavar> slot ragtime into all of your slots. Nothing else even comes close to 3 minutes of ZA WARULDO

[4:16:20] <+ChunLoArt> @Graxe_ oh cool just thought it was a skin. Thanks for clarifying

[4:16:22] <%Trinity5> @joylent_blue facts
[4:16:25] <%sshen> Twitch didn't even notify me you were live dangit
[4:16:25] <evbites> why does buster do more in it's description it says it's not as powerful
[4:16:27] <%aishman> I guess I can never have the Mega Buster?
[4:16:32] <novusboi> Bruh tbh DMC has caused tangible health issues in me too
[4:16:39] <%joylent_blue> god shut up Nero LUL i love you
[4:16:42] <fabnanman> @aishman you can buy the dx stuff as dlc
[4:16:44] <novusboi> why eat or sleep when you can style
[4:16:45] <%MrBorisMakarov> oof
[4:16:47] <+DFDEDSDCD> What difficulty?
[4:16:49] <+Cryghoul> 3 hits ri
[4:16:51] <+namillus> yoooo, Showdown as your DT fades is the hypest shit
[4:16:51] <%TheFilth> these guys two shot you in DMD

[4:16:53] <%Ion_LaserX> @DFDEDSDCD SoS
[4:16:55] <%MisterRockett> There's still a few cutscenes I haven't seen yet across the Woolie LP and your streams so there's gonna be a moment where I'm gonna be seeing new content through the live action stuff and I just can't wait for it.
[4:16:55] <+Clik404> @aishman deluxe upgrade $10
[4:16:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> SOoS
[4:17:00] <abakkus> "give em a taste of the good shit" is possibly one of my fav Nero lines hah
[4:17:03] <gustavozxd> dmc5 completely ultra fucked my sleep schedule
[4:17:05] <person181> style is all you need, much like power
[4:17:06] <GandhiTheTerrible> PSYCHO CRUSHA
[4:17:08] <Pillagius> B for the effort Kappa
[4:17:10] <+Cryghoul> megabuster sucks
[4:17:13] <mayorrev> awww
[4:17:14] <majindusto> DMC5 is bad for peoples health
[4:17:20] <+chrishnaw> It's too bad you don't like Mega Man
[4:17:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> THATS RIGHT JAY
[4:17:23] <%thewildzubat> pastabreaker is best arm
[4:17:24] <%TheFilth> jokes on you, I had none to begin with
[4:17:25] <mayorrev> megabuster is fiiine
[4:17:26] <%cappyd33> i love how you can see nero's new arm when the breakaway happens
[4:17:27] <%joylent_blue> it also fucked my schedule wtf
[4:17:28] <gustavozxd> mega buster is sadly really bad, just kind of a meme arm
[4:17:30] <+keksisblyat> Ye it’s not great
[4:17:33] <%Laecerelius> Mortals can't handle this kind of hype
[4:17:35] <%aishman> By the by, I can't tell what impresses me more
[4:17:37] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @AngriestPat How do you feel about nero's DT design?
[4:17:39] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> good for the dodge
[4:17:44] <+Cryghoul> ooo i hate those guys
[4:17:46] <%aishman> That Woolie just put out all of ya'lls recorded session

[4:17:52] <PsychoFlash1> i'm so happy to see it turned out a great game that everyone is having fun with
[4:17:54] <Force_Zer0> I was in this mission right now. Couldn't get S rank by a few points, feels bad meng.
[4:17:54] <stingray53_1> pat have you tried jumping through Malphas's portals?
[4:17:57] <conflict1914> quick pick up sweet surrender
[4:18:03] <+RadDude6969> Mega Buster is fun for a while at least
[4:18:06] <skittleram> got the game sunday of release and played it all night, went to school completely drained
[4:18:16] <novusboi> I think I liked the original concept art for Nero’s DT better
[4:18:17] <%TheFilth> who else switched their breaker and bringer buttons?
[4:18:19] <%joylent_blue> aishman yeah, i just wish there wasn't now a week+ of nothing LUL
[4:18:20] <+noajenkk> hey chat, what difficulty is this?

[4:19:30] <%joylent_blue> god when i saw that animation the first time i immediately used Break Away LUL "nope fuck that fuck that"
[4:19:30] <abakkus> give the enemies a little scratchy scratch behind the ear to make them calm down with sweet surrender
[4:19:34] <televisedrevolt> Pat you've seen V's execution on Vergil, right?
[4:19:34] <+Cryghoul> is this diverging point: nero?
[4:19:35] <%Gespens> @madhattergay it's Kyrie's sex toy devil breaker

[4:19:43] <%yoshkosh20> sweet surrender creeps me out
[4:19:44] <acp101123> for relieving kyrie's "stress"
[4:19:53] <gustavozxd> judecca are annoying yeah
[4:19:57] <Graxe_> If Sweet Surrender is also a regen for Nero while being a vibrating hand for Kyrie, does that mean that it makes Nero last longer?
[4:19:59] <OkamiDude15> @madhattergay its an extra devil breaker you get with the deluxe edition dlc
[4:20:01] <VRNK> its for sensual romantic massages
[4:20:15] <%TheFilth> half the time I just use Tomboy's breaker straight away since I'm just gonna be hit using it anyway
[4:20:22] <%yoshkosh20> hidden jackhammer function
[4:20:32] <arcaderabbit48> @Graxe_ Its a good time for both of them
[4:20:32] <+keksisblyat> The summoner enemies and the new blitzes are probably my least favorite enemies in the game
[4:20:38] <%madhattergay> so nero fucks as well as being allowed to sy fuck
[4:20:38] <Mrthepastyrider> isn't it a goofy how in some games health is used as a resource but in this game losing health just makes you sad
[4:20:40] <+namillus> Interestingly, Tomboy absolutely ruins Hell Antenora, because it has barely any knockdown
[4:20:44] <chikensandwich> have you got Nero gum chewing taunt?
[4:20:46] <abakkus> Nero Fucks
[4:20:53] <%joylent_blue> i never use Tomboy breakage because i'm overconfident :) i get hit every time :)
[4:20:56] <+TheoTTree> Judeccas are terrifying
[4:20:56] <gustavozxd> they just teleport away NotLikeThis
[4:20:57] <Zombrocom> Judecas are super annoying
[4:20:59] <+chrishnaw> I believe in you
[4:21:01] <OkamiDude15> i almost always use the air buster on the hells to mitigate the long animation
[4:21:03] <+TheoTTree> Idk how to consistently deal with the fuckers
[4:21:03] <samldh> to be fair, tomboy ruins every enemy
[4:21:07] <Zombrocom> Sick buster on them though
[4:21:08] <%J_Papa> Do you suppose Nero commissioned Sweet Surrender or did Nico come up with the idea?
[4:21:08] <PsychoFlash1> @Mrthepastyrider ahhaha yes
[4:21:08] <abakkus> v fucks, Nero fucks, dante eats pizza
[4:21:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Did he survive?
[4:21:10] <%madhattergay> do we think nero drinks?
[4:21:16] <+RadDude6969> they almost always have super armor
[4:21:17] <+namillus> @joylent_blue Tomboy's Break Age actually makes it unbreakable until the effect ends
[4:21:19] <Force_Zer0> Nice combo and style meter, would be a shame if I just teleport out of it and hide and then hit you off-screen :^)
[4:21:19] <SomeAsianDood> @madhattergay of course not
[4:21:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh shit pats still alive, How was the being ass sick
[4:21:29] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat have you done the Rawhide special animation against this upcoming boss?
[4:21:32] <arcaderabbit48> @madhattergay I don't think of them can get drunk, their bodies are too strong
[4:21:33] <%SlugNut> SlugNut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Finished DMCV a couple days ago and it's one of the very few games I immediately went back in. Can't wait to catch the video of the stream later!
[4:21:34] <gustavozxd> the lady/Trish ending in dmc4 shows how much of a virgin Dante is
[4:21:36] <%TheFilth> Nero is a wholesome boy who is straight EDGE
[4:21:36] <majindusto> This boss was a pain for me
[4:21:38] <curechan9> nice and easy with no health
[4:21:40] <%joylent_blue> namillus oh i know, i always think "nah i won't get hit" and then i get hit
[4:21:41] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @AngriestPat How do you like Nero's DT?
[4:21:45] <+TheoTTree> That's a very anime line
[4:21:45] <Idon__> POW
[4:21:52] <%madhattergay> nero says the fuck word
[4:21:54] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat tomboy interacts with devil trigger in some way?
[4:21:55] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> OMEGALUL
[4:22:00] <Pillagius> @keksisblyat can agree on summoners but, the new blitzes are pretty fun do deal with :D
[4:22:04] <%Ganerumo> SPARDA'S GRANDNUT
[4:22:05] <%TheFilth> The hair is the only strange thing
[4:22:06] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> oh. these segments are acctually in the game.
[4:22:11] <NumberTooBig> these cutscenes are the best
[4:22:14] <+fragdar> the long hair is shit
[4:22:17] <faldin> i dig the hair
[4:22:18] <VRNK> the fucking jpeg in the foreground
[4:22:19] <a_mad_dragon> demon mullet
[4:22:20] <Goldenwolf98> I like that his DT is so skinny it fits him well
[4:22:20] <+misterfistor> its onimusha its fine
[4:22:21] <Amber_Crow> prefer the stand, hair ba
[4:22:21] <artoflec> i love the onimusha hair
[4:22:23] <Prism_Wing> Dat Hollow Ichigo
[4:22:23] <indig0bird> I really like his short hair
[4:22:23] <%joylent_blue> the hairs fine to me
[4:22:24] <+TheoTTree> Hair is cool imo
[4:22:25] <+toilet_chan> he looks like a weird Zinogre
[4:22:25] <+Cryghoul> Nelo angelo horns
[4:22:27] <gunzerkingdunce> @santystuffs its not a rawhide thing I think, I think its just a normal chain Snatch thing if you parry the chicken head
[4:22:28] <FenixSeraph> I like the hoodie too but the bishie hair is fine
[4:22:28] <%ScreamingMeat> Yeah the hair is a bit TOO anime for my tastes
[4:22:30] <+ChunLoArt> oh god the cutscene
[4:22:33] <copyritetm> I think Nero is the best looking character in the game
[4:22:33] <soup_erb> ONIMUSHA HAIR
[4:22:34] <curechan9> someone got payed for being a bird
[4:22:38] <gustavozxd> how do you do that rawhide animation anyway, I did it but idk the conditions for it
[4:22:43] <dsauce999> I like that the colors are just classic devilman
[4:22:45] <%weissguard> I mean, Nero's DT makes him look like the Savior from DMCIV to me. @AngriestPat
[4:22:46] <%MagickBurritoh> it's a fucking chicken
[4:22:46] <abakkus> limp Dante hair
[4:22:50] <%joylent_blue> it satisfied the part of me that kinda wanted Vergil to have long hair after so long in hell
[4:22:51] <0rond> I love the way this fight starts on SoS
[4:22:52] <conflict1914> Nero's DT is very eastern demon influenced where as Dante's is more western demon
[4:22:54] <deadguyisdead> of course pat hates hair
[4:22:55] <Pookiedaexzile> This chicken lady seems like a diss to the Baby and Mom in DMC:Devil MAy cry
[4:22:56] <%thewildzubat> Bad Chocobo
[4:23:01] <VRNK> its one of those things from ashes of ariandel
[4:23:01] <OkamiDude15> @gustavozxd probably have to cause a stun and then do a wire grab
[4:23:02] <Goldenwolf98> such a weird boss
[4:23:05] <%TheFilth> @gustavozxd when she's staggered you can snatch the bird with rawhide
[4:23:06] <Idon__> I kinda wished he had some sort of clothes on in DT.
[4:23:06] <%aishman> Oh, funny enough, I watched Max stream DMC4 and I was like "Man, I know Pat and Woolie loved this game but I could have SWORN a lot of people did not enjoy it." Only to then see Max go from enjoying it to getting super fucking mad and say the game sucks.
[4:23:09] <GandhiTheTerrible> SUPER SEXY SEXY

[4:23:29] <%madhattergay> @AngriestPat whats yor fave breaker?
[4:23:33] <a_mad_dragon> it still has the mash mechanic for grabs?
[4:23:35] <mayorrev> what the hell was that
[4:23:36] <arcaderabbit48> There is so much going on, I literally could not see what was happening
[4:23:37] <+l3sovikk> I lamed out this fight in SoS with color up
[4:23:40] <+KSabot> Bosses become the easiest part of this game as you become better
[4:23:45] <+Cryghoul> buster move
[4:23:53] <Pookiedaexzile> I haven't seen somebody dunked on that hard since NBA JAM in the summer of 92
[4:23:54] <%joylent_blue> thanks Dad
[4:23:56] <%Hilleltaco> @a_mad_dragon On certain ones yeah
[4:24:01] <Force_Zer0> The charge attack of this boss reminds me of Ludwig's charge attack from Bloodborne. Meaning they both do a fuckzillion damage

[4:25:42] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> THIS IS THE BEST
[4:25:43] <Futurecity10> This is basically Kingdom hearts parking lot
[4:25:45] <%J_Papa> First time on this boss i was charging Buster Arm when the boss was down and V threw a Ragtime right on me, so it switched to that and i lost my grab chance

[4:27:12] <arcaderabbit48> I'd have preferred the mocap scenes personally, but these are good too
[4:27:12] <gunzerkingdunce> Was V's intention evil?
[4:27:13] <Pookiedaexzile> So is V the half of Vergil who can seducegirls
