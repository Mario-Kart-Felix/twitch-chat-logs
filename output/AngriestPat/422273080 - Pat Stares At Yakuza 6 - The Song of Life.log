[0:12:33] <WreckItRaz> Tell your friend to stream it big

[0:12:51] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer300 If you like story in your MMOs, ala XIV then I would shy away from Elder Scrolls Online. It's basically Skyrim Online.
[0:12:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> ESO is a solid game, but I don't think you'd like it very much. It's not like an Elder Scrolls game mechanically.
[0:12:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Play the best FF...FF3(6).
[0:12:53] <+yohsefa> Better than fallout 76 but that’s not saying much

[0:23:32] <lloyddboy> GAMER HYPERCUBE

[0:23:35] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh no not the Time Cube
[0:23:38] <HeadsHeldHigh> Does gamercube support race mixing?
[0:23:38] <+tigerfang86> NUMBERS ARE CONSUMED
[0:23:40] <$jobbedbone> RADIANS AREN'T
[0:23:41] <$nademonkey1100> what
[0:23:41] <+firelink_dweller> @AngriestPat Y the fuck did you put prior thought into "the best number for a cube"
[0:23:43] <%blastazoid26> You are an arbitrary number
[0:23:43] <$HentaiSenpai9K> But if @peachsaliva is in chat.........WHOS TALKING?!
[0:23:44] <%king_wragles> THINK ABOUT IT
[0:23:44] <%CJett92> Think about it
[0:23:46] <Madbearv> pat you LIED to me
[0:23:46] <%nmaten> checkmate athiests
[0:23:47] <%ElenaManetta> Numbers are just a gimmick invented by the mathing card company
[0:23:47] <$cureneckbeard> 1 isn't arbitrary
[0:23:49] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat BUT NUMBER GO UP
[0:23:49] <+tigerfang86> THINK ABOUT IT THO
[0:23:49] <@lewdskeletor13> HOW?
[0:23:49] <%valriot> COMSUME 69 Kappa Kappa
[0:23:49] <%laserbeaming> RADIANS ARE DOPE
[0:23:50] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Space triggers my anxiety
[0:23:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@VanLynx) (warning)
[0:23:51] <%theAncopro> consumables wouldn't exist without numbers
[0:23:51] <%onlystrykerfan> beuchiThink beuchiThink beuchiThink beuchiThink
[0:23:52] <切捨御免> calories are numbers Kappa
[0:23:55] <$jobbedbone> radians aren't arbitrary
[0:23:55] <%averyoddjew> paige, explain yourself
[0:23:55] <%TheDullaMAN> Numbers are a Temporary Buff
[0:23:57] <%MagickBurritoh> No Paige
[0:23:57] <flubber3d> numbers run this whole show, c'mon now
[0:23:58] <Madbearv> timecube
[0:23:59] <alexandrecau> numbers are cake
[0:24:00] <+MinovskyPhysics> Oh hey, Patrick is in his cube
[0:24:00] <primarch_lupercal> Makes you think doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[0:24:02] <@lewdskeletor13> THATS NOT EVEN A LITTLE TRUE
[0:24:04] <+frunkAF> your time is a consumable item, Pat
[0:24:07] <r_Foeburden87> cmonBruh cmonBruh
[0:24:08] <+MinovskyPhysics> actually looks comfy
[0:24:09] <%stabbityrabbit> But...infinity as a concept exists because numbers...
[0:24:12] <+dawsfloss> @angriestpat have you decided if you streaming ESO? teatheSneaky
[0:24:12] <@PeachSaliva> @frunkaf nice!
[0:24:13] <+Tokanova> pat rejects that with his entire being
[0:24:17] <+C0rdak> Numbers are just instances that have been accounted for
[0:24:17] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat the time cube must be defeated so that numbers become a permanent buff!
[0:24:17] <$cureneckbeard> Four consecutive earth days in one earth day rotation. You are educated stupid. 4 x 4 = 16
[0:24:17] <%MagickBurritoh> All your cells are consumable items
[0:24:18] <alexandrecau> that you eat for mathematic instead of dessert
[0:24:19] <VritraReiRei> You can't just say something so controversial without explaining it WOMAN! D:
[0:24:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> @C0rdak A 4 sided geometric figure with non-90-degree angles at the corners, but they still gotta add up to 360 degrees.
[0:24:24] <%AncelDeLambert> my vector calculus is sadly rusty

[0:24:35] <+HotBloodedHero> If time travel were real it'd be even less consumable
[0:24:37] <person181> crash it
[0:24:37] <$SGrim> Time is a consumable. No wonder Pat wants immortality woopsD

[0:25:21] <%stabbityrabbit> Oh, chat, has Pat acknowledged the existence of Code Vein?
[0:25:23] <%Jetsfantasy> They're changing my main WHM too
[0:25:24] <$QuesoFM> what happened to skyrim???
[0:25:25] <%skizzuto> If Pat and Paige fused into one person then they'd be the ultimate streamer
[0:25:26] <televisedrevolting> *mic shit

[0:25:48] <%CJett92> CALLED OUT
[0:25:49] <SilverFaustX> MHW pc now has the witcher 3 update
[0:25:50] <+dawsfloss> I wonder if Pat can write off the Cube as a business expense
[0:25:53] <@lewdskeletor13> BibleThump poor guinea pigs
[0:25:53] <VanLynx> recycled facts
[0:25:57] <Seitine> As someone who has guinea pigs, I love that fact. <3
[0:25:58] <%TheDullaMAN> Hey Valriot
[0:25:59] <bigbradish> Arent they also extremely territorial and cannibalistic?
[0:26:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Most pet stores won't just sell you one guniea pig.
[0:26:00] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat I only have so many.
[0:26:01] <%Zamorouskiwhich> He has run out of fun facts monkaS
[0:26:02] <%TheDullaMAN> ...Fuck you.
[0:26:27] <jonathandemel> Deja vu
[0:26:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Time to donate again apatDab
[0:26:34] <Seitine> Territorial a bit, they have social structure. Cannibalistic? No. They can only eat veg.
[0:26:34] <+tigerfang86> somehow it'll get worse
[0:26:44] <Bailey__gaming> That Chernobyl show was pretty good tbh
[0:26:44] <%Jetsfantasy> It'll be more realistic
[0:26:46] <+tigerfang86> WHO'S TALKING
[0:26:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Nooo I wanted my janky Sonic!
[0:26:50] <+cvp5127> we all lose anyway
[0:26:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Worse.
[0:26:58] <%SpamKingRathalos> worse
[0:26:58] <+C0rdak> MONO EYE THOUGH
[0:26:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sonic can only get worse
[0:27:00] <%CJett92> They NEED to fix the eyes
[0:27:02] <Madbearv> teeth teeth teeth
[0:27:03] <aizt> GoTtA gO fAsT
[0:27:04] <ChoculaUltra> I hope they give him shark teeth
[0:27:04] <DXLelouch24> did you guys see SHADMANS design change?
[0:27:06] <DXLelouch24> JESUS
[0:27:08] <televisedrevolting> They'll make the teeth bigger.
[0:27:16] <Archmortal> eyes for sure.
[0:27:16] <%king_wragles> I don't want to watch Sonic go on an adventure, I WANT TO SEE A TRAINWRECK OF FAILED HUMANITY
[0:27:17] <%averyoddjew> doesn't matter if they fix how he looks, the plot will still be absolutely awful
[0:27:18] <%valriot> I hope they use Shadbases design
[0:27:20] <%ElenaManetta> Pupils, but probably not eye shapes
[0:27:20] <Ion_Laser> they'll probably fix the teeth, the eyes, and make him a darker blue
[0:27:24] <alexandrecau> give hime tusks
[0:27:24] <%TheNewJapanGuy> FEM SONIC is already a thing right now
[0:27:25] <ChoculaUltra> bigger teeth, smaller eyes.
[0:27:25] <JamvaanPS4> Agreed, the teeth wouldn't be so bad if he had the eyes
[0:27:26] <%ElenaManetta> The eye shapes would take way too much work to change the entire model.
[0:27:27] <%SpamKingRathalos> Shadman has been doing gods work
[0:27:28] <Kief_Gringo> NOT Shadmans design pls x.x
[0:27:30] <General_Terro> HANDS
[0:27:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Eyes are fine. And I thought people hated Shadman cause he's a pervy pedo creep.
[0:27:38] <ChoculaUltra> give him an extra arm too why not
[0:27:42] <%kujofire990> oh god Shadman's design
[0:27:42] <sphereshots12> Hands
[0:27:43] <televisedrevolting> @dxlelouch24 I saw that and got worried about...things.
[0:27:44] <%jiin6> he looked like sonic mixed with a minion
[0:27:48] <%Fadedblank247> yeah Sonic should have the one unified eye
[0:27:48] <+C0rdak> What if they just make him just a real hedgehog
[0:27:49] <alcors_wisdom> @Kief_Gringo shadman's is the only acceptable one
[0:27:49] <JumbleJams> the eyes work it's just the teeth and lips that are bad
[0:27:51] <Jontman42> No don't do the mono-eye
[0:27:52] <aizt> the worst part of the trailer was the stretching right when gangsters paradise begins to play
[0:27:53] <%Remery_> Why did they lewd that thing >.<
[0:27:55] <%Jetsfantasy> Or white goggles
[0:27:56] <%jiin6> Sonic is an Isekai
[0:27:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> He needs gloves.
[0:27:59] <+tigerfang86> DICK ARM???
[0:28:00] <@lewdskeletor13> I want the awful sonic design
[0:28:02] <%ElenaManetta> Just make the Sonic Dreams design hyper realistic
[0:28:02] <arcaderabbit48> I feel like his actual proportions need to be fixed the most. His arms and legs are super small but then his head is massive??
[0:28:08] <+tigerfang86> BIG BEEFY TROGDOR ARM
[0:28:08] <Seitine> LUL
[0:28:09] <+Manjove> thats my fetish
[0:28:13] <alcors_wisdom> so long as his dick arm has a glove
[0:28:14] <%Ascethetic> @peachsaliva you excited for Detective Pikachu?
[0:28:14] <%segbas2004> but people can't be attached to ALIENS, they can only be attached to human things
[0:28:19] <%domokun124> shadman is such a strange person. I don't understand most the stuff he makes
[0:28:28] <%king_wragles> @segbas2004 counter point: ET
[0:28:32] <arcaderabbit48> PLAY SKYRIM INSTEAD
[0:28:33] <$Garthunox> are you playing and watching?
[0:28:35] <%jiin6> give sonic a tiny alien mouth in his mouth
[0:28:37] <aizt> slepy yakoozies
[0:28:38] <ChoculaUltra> give him a spider pincers - solves the whole weird teeth thing no problem
[0:28:40] <$nademonkey1100> fuck yes my favorite commentary

[0:38:25] <%Remery_> Believe in your own Justice!
[0:38:26] <$Mendin> He woke up FROM Justis
[0:38:26] <vergil_angelo> The best part is that when you fight the JUSTIS members, they all use their moves

[0:38:51] <%MightyMaxT> Its not JUST chaos. I mean, Tanahashi is in it. And he is true justice
[0:38:52] <%Sulliman34> kiryu's eyes kinda freak me out in this game
[0:38:54] <%shiplord13> He always does
[0:38:54] <%jiin6> rubbed rice into the wound, fixed it right up
[0:39:00] <%Omegaanimus> And Naito is LiJ
[0:39:04] <ChoculaUltra> dammit, not Sachiko!
[0:39:06] <aizt> when is kiryu not a lost pupper?
[0:39:07] <%MagickBurritoh> deal
[0:39:07] <%Kataguro> Sachiko? That bitch sounds like she needs punching in her smug face
[0:39:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Kiryu looks lost most of the time
[0:39:12] <%psychocalibur> where did mafia go?
[0:39:14] <%Niney_Who> "Sure I'll kill them"
[0:39:15] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu's READY

[0:39:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL LUL LUL Sure, let's kill them all.
[0:39:26] <%Omegaanimus> Kiryu or Naito, who is the more tranquillo???
[0:39:27] <HeadsHeldHigh> Lol Kiryu just like "Okay, I'll break their bones ands stuff"
[0:39:27] <alcors_wisdom> *kiryu saves some guy from getting his ass kicked in the street* "i would die for you kiryu"
[0:39:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Kill them all Kiryu
[0:39:29] <President_valentine> Only a 100
[0:39:32] <%SpamKingRathalos> only 100?
[0:39:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Naito could beat Kiryu
[0:39:40] <%Sulliman34> remember when kiryu fought A HUNDRED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
[0:39:42] <$Yakobro> kill them all
[0:39:43] <$Garthunox> Why doesn't Kiryu, the stronger of the bunch, just eat the rest?
[0:39:45] <st_jimmy456> not everyone's a literal tank like you
[0:39:45] <%shiplord13> Wow... So scary Kiryu says.
[0:39:48] <alcors_wisdom> quick did kiryu ever kidnap a girl
[0:39:51] <%SpamKingRathalos> Rip & Tear
[0:39:55] <Malziel> You just have to BELIEVE hard enough LUL
[0:39:58] <%Sulliman34> @alcors_wisdom technically yes
[0:40:00] <President_valentine> Evv
[0:40:00] <%jiin6> Kiryu is all that matters, this saddens kiryu
[0:40:03] <Kojo208> Majima was kinda a main character
[0:40:05] <alexandrecau> Justis is like bigger than Tojo at that point
[0:40:06] <VanLynx> tbf he did meet like 5 OTHER main characters
[0:40:06] <arkv01> he knows he's the MC and has to keep his dick virgin for Nagoshi
[0:40:07] <omen_setter> Kiryu is the main character of japan
[0:40:07] <%kujofire990> GANG WAR!!!!
[0:40:10] <ChoculaUltra> if Joe ends up fighting a dude named Mendoza I'm gon cri.
[0:40:12] <alcors_wisdom> phrasing right @Sulliman34 did he ever hold a girl hostage
[0:40:13] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat he figured it out at the end of 1, he just doesn't care.
[0:40:14] <%NWR_James> Imagine if you spent 20 years just ripping through impossible odds, you'd be some kind of dilusional lunatic
[0:40:14] <JumbleJams> adopting is a nicer word for kidnapping
[0:40:18] <%shiplord13> He knows he can fight off the entire population of Japan in hand to hand combat and will win
[0:40:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> If Kota Ibushi turns up in this game I'm out.
[0:40:23] <lloyddboy> OH
[0:40:26] <flying_man_3> I feel like killing 3 up start evil gangs before breakfast is just normal for Kiryu at this point
[0:40:30] <sosuke5> Kiryu is kinda like Yami from Black Clover
[0:40:30] <+CanonHusbando> kiryu 100% walks up to dudes and says "that's enough" 100% knowing they're gonna fight him and he's gonna win
[0:40:32] <aizt> kiryu is the only kick ass MC that isnt in jail
[0:40:34] <%mastertwin2> Kiryu must have caught on by like Yak5 and is super exploiting his MC powers
[0:40:37] <%zanzibar_junker> Forget this
[0:40:38] <%psychocalibur> talk to mafia
[0:40:38] <%Das_Bass> cat?
[0:40:41] <%Sulliman34> @alcors_wisdom in the eyes of the law he held haruka hostage in yakuza 1

[0:40:43] <%TheNewJapanGuy> apatWink
[0:40:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> @aizt That isn;t CURRENTLY in jail.
[0:40:50] <$Garthunox> meow wow
[0:40:50] <+CanonHusbando> kiryu is basically squirrel girl
[0:40:51] <+C0rdak> In reality, Kiryu's arms would have been broken since Kuze did them in in the sewer
[0:40:51] <%SpamKingRathalos> Kiryu is the ultimate life form
[0:40:52] <%Wrashis> i think nishkiyama's fatal error was that he THOUGHT he was the main character
[0:40:53] <President_valentine> Akiyama ain't in jail
[0:40:54] <ToneBacas> as Megaman's Zero one said, "what am i fighting fooooooooorghhhhhh?!"
[0:40:56] <%jiin6> Kiryu has killed japan twice
[0:40:56] <@lewdskeletor13> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[0:40:56] <%PlainSimpleTailor> He's Japanese Singham

[0:40:58] <alcors_wisdom> @Sulliman34 yeah but he never like used her as a human sheild
[0:40:58] <RupanSen> Kiryu has literally no ideals
[0:41:00] <%Kataguro> I hope it's like 10 guys
[0:41:00] <razorgem> LET's GO
[0:41:00] <%Cthulos> @aizt he's been to jail multiple times
[0:41:02] <%theAncopro> He fought that tiger's ideals
[0:41:03] <st_jimmy456> even when he steals a baby
[0:41:04] <%shiplord13> Kiryu just refuses to die that is it
[0:41:06] <primarch_lupercal> ahh this is the intro to the minigame
[0:41:06] <KeWeaHermano> Kiryu aka Super Japan Man
[0:41:07] <%Sulliman34> @alcors_wisdom oh god n o
[0:41:11] <aizt> i meant currently
[0:41:16] <%SpamKingRathalos> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[0:41:17] <$Garthunox> Kiryu keeps his ideals
[0:41:20] <%Cthulos> he got out of jail before this game started
[0:41:20] <%Kataguro> Wow, multiples
[0:41:20] <SilverFaustX> i didnt like the minigame
[0:41:23] <Tucker0603> oh God is this the RTS?
[0:41:25] <falconx9k> They're just standing there... MENACINGLY
[0:41:30] <%domokun124> so as someone who has never played a yakuza game. is kiryu the main protagonist for every game?
[0:41:31] <%TheNewJapanGuy> @Pat Stop using logic
[0:41:33] <%Kataguro> Is this a fucking RTS?
[0:41:34] <omen_setter> Kiryu is the ideal confucian gentleman, except for the fact that i don't think he reads
[0:41:35] <$nademonkey1100> PLOT ARMOR
[0:41:37] <+burritocheetos> YAKUZA CRAFT
[0:41:38] <%Omegaanimus> it's worth it for the post battle cut scenes
[0:41:41] <%jiin6> he rubbed with sushi, fixed the bones right up
[0:41:43] <NeroInfinite> Welcome to the RTS pat
[0:41:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Both Kiryu and Kuze should have been crippled by the sewer fight
[0:41:45] <person181> mob rush minigame, kinda fun
[0:41:45] <JumbleJams> these jobbers just waiting
[0:41:46] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat he ate shit with his bike kuze is the one that should be dead

[0:41:48] <%SpamKingRathalos> Sure looks like 100
[0:41:48] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat it wasn't a real pipe like how they don't use real guns
[0:41:50] <$MonsterEnvy> Well both Kiryu and Kuze are badasses
[0:41:50] <+C0rdak> 4 of those guys are the SAME
[0:41:51] <%kujofire990> YAKUZACRAFT
[0:41:51] <+trekkie11041> @domokun124 yes
[0:41:51] <%mastertwin2> The Laws of Physics don't apply to Yakuza
[0:41:52] <alcors_wisdom> @domokun124 for the most part there are times you play as other characters but you play as kiryu in every game
[0:41:52] <%shiplord13> Yakuza don't operate the same as normal humans
[0:41:53] <efratzy> its like when you hit a mailbox with a bat only the mailbox is a greek god
[0:41:54] <majindusto> JUSTIS SHALL FALL
[0:41:54] <%ElenaManetta> Look at this crowd of triplets
[0:41:54] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat Don't forget the baseball bat to the back of the head!
[0:41:58] <bearwagon> i hope this doesnt turn out like the pocket racing for Pat
[0:42:01] <$Garthunox> Kiryu has an Aura of Might
[0:42:06] <%bread_assassin> We need someone to calculate the force of the impact Kiryu takes from that pipe swing.

[0:46:25] <%averyoddjew> kiryu literally did nothing
[0:46:28] <%king_wragles> Why are they talking like they just got done with a pokemon battle?
[0:46:29] <NeroInfinite> There's no point to it at all.
[0:46:31] <vingadivo> Clap
[0:46:32] <%supersugoisenpai1> You're sure not gonna like grinding this mini game for completion
[0:46:32] <%Over_ninek> it's nice that Kiryu is finally getting away from gang life
[0:46:34] <SilverFaustX> i did this all really fast to get rid of it
[0:46:35] <%Kataguro> Is there really cool content locked behind this dumb minigame?
[0:46:35] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Did Kiryu just form his own gang?
[0:46:36] <+fgcmorad> But you get to fight wrestlers
[0:46:36] <xiidrifty> Thank god Clan Creator had absolutely nothing to do with the main story and just became a road bump and nothing more
[0:46:37] <mr_ESB> Good thing you only have to play this once
[0:46:38] <alcors_wisdom> how do they not know about kiryu

[0:46:55] <+smargh1015> couldn't Kiryu just beat up all these guys by himself?
[0:46:56] <$Brother_Coduss> because that man has A KNIFE

[0:49:05] <xiidrifty> There are certain things that are locked unless you do a certain amount of Clan Creator battles and that's whack. Like the Black Market
[0:49:09] <%Kataguro> Gangs Are No Good

[0:49:14] <$Garthunox> this shit is boring
[0:49:16] <%MoraMiarty> every pause just makes kiryu look so confused and disinterested
[0:49:17] <%NWR_James> It's almost like the plot of Yakuza 5
[0:49:19] <juxtest> Then some guy beat them up before we could
[0:49:20] <$Garthunox> not the stream

[0:57:08] <powerprotoman> par dont question grandpa hes very tired
[0:57:13] <alcors_wisdom> the start of the game is just the dojima family telling him to fuck off because theres no way kiryu could fight traid schmucks in the streets

[0:57:48] <%MagickBurritoh> Holy fuck Kiryu is addicted to cimre
[0:57:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Her Supreme shirt says Rabbit
[0:57:53] <+BKNPham> ~Supreme~
[0:57:53] <%SpamKingRathalos> RABBIT
[0:57:54] <$shurtal> or taxi driver
[0:57:55] <alcors_wisdom> kiryu turns everyone around him into criminals
[0:57:56] <frigglefroogle> what do you mean? kiryu never did crimes
[0:57:57] <%Kataguro> He was also a taxi driver
[0:57:57] <$Garthunox> this is definitely the low point of the game
[0:57:58] <arkv01> dude that guy and this girl are NOT RELATED
[0:57:58] <Ion_Laser> he radiates BIG CRIMES and NOT MURDER
[0:58:04] <%ECRead> Kiryu: not ok with being Chairman of a legitimate yakuza clan. Also Kiryu: I'll be chairman of this "Kiryu Clan" tho
[0:58:05] <vingadivo> SUPREMURU
[0:58:07] <%zanzibar_junker> real estate is super crime though
[0:58:07] <%jiin6> he hides his energy from his Stoic face
[0:58:08] <%SpamKingRathalos> Just flex
[0:58:11] <+dukenux> Floss on them Kiryu
[0:58:14] <majindusto> Rabbit
[0:58:14] <+Xeno351> it's not a yakuza clan it's just yakuza SHAPED LUL
[0:58:15] <%Over_ninek> the crime energy is masked by his aura of HONOR, only other criminals can recognize it
[0:58:16] <+Deepfriedhamster> "I volounteer to run this gang war to pass the time"
[0:58:20] <+Dre_> nice Supreme hoodie
[0:58:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Rabbit?
[0:58:23] <arkv01> master yakuzies
[0:58:24] <maverickdrifter> Running a real estate is basically just running a gang
[0:58:24] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu does big assaults which are crimes but he doesn't murder
[0:58:27] <%MightyMaxT> This sounds exactly like the Persona 5 talking music
[0:58:29] <%psychocalibur> MAFIA!
[0:58:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dab on the haters, Kiryu-san!
[0:58:29] <juxtest> Once Kiryu has a monopoly on crime he wont have to fight all this yakuza bullshit anymore

[1:26:31] <alexandrecau> @soupjunkie yes he would he was around in kiwami
[1:26:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 last one. Have 2 quests lined up for them. 1 is a cave rumored to contain tons of gold and is very well protected. The lead will be an incomplete ad for a dwarven bank. The second is a temple guarding a wish granting item. At the end the guardian lets them grab one from a pile, like the grail from Indiana Jones. The trick is ALL the objects grant wishes (in some capacity) but only 1 grants it no strings attached. A certain item will give off a sound on hearing wishes, "HAIL 2 U!"
[1:26:34] <natebud> Majima's asskicking actually reformed this guy.
[1:26:34] <+Punisher7771> wait majima didnt kill that fuckker

[1:29:58] <Malziel> the BEST response to a cult.
[1:29:59] <%king_wragles> K

[1:30:02] <Futurecity10> Cults should be illegal
[1:30:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @alexandrecau I meant the old man admit it. Not that it matters. Kiryu believes pretty much everything he's told.

[1:33:01] <alcors_wisdom> well yeah thats part of the problem but the fact that you clean things with 99.9% germ killing shit is essentially accelerating the evolution of antibacterial resistant Bactria and viruses @AngriestPat
[1:33:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He wrote the damn tenants.
[1:33:03] <%Kirby_Sauce> I realized that Japan really got it's cult problem after the Emperor stepped down as an idol of worship. Is this related?

[2:13:26] <%Promessa_EX> kombat&

[2:13:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound but the heat move was sick though
[2:13:49] <SilverFaustX> go back to fighter
[2:13:50] <%D33TR> 10 000 calories no big deal kiryu
[2:13:50] <GenericSoda> if theres one thing yakuza has taught me its that japan is filled with ghosts
[2:13:52] <+Manjove> B I G
[2:13:53] <%Kataguro> Can he join your gang?
[2:13:53] <%Omegaanimus> Pat, go to Snack New Gaudi
[2:13:56] <ミュウレ4242> 10,000 calories, for punching with.
[2:13:58] <%ECRead> just a little cut in his intestines... and galbladder... possibly a kidney...
[2:13:58] <%Ilpala271> hungry from BIG MURDER
[2:13:59] <%MafiaBTW> MafiaBTW subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:13:59] <kloudraws> so are the yakuza thugs illusions of kiryus mind, so hes just doing sick moves at nothing?
[2:14:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> neat change: in the older games they used to be there after you finished beating them up. now they just dissapear
[2:14:06] <PortableBoredom> @AngriestPat I think there's a trophy for getting hit by a car, if you can manage it.
[2:14:12] <%TheYellowcouch> Kiryu would be so op in an MGS game, he can shot and stab people NON LETHALLY
[2:14:14] <%snow_bush> Why does Kiryu seem like he'd be a fighting game boss?
[2:14:14] <InugamiTheHound> @doc_ock_rokc yeah it was super sick. But How is kid gonna race with out a pocket car
[2:14:17] <%Solidnick18> dropkick
[2:14:17] <+Raidou24> Did Pat beat Yakuza 5?
[2:14:21] <%NWR_James> @Youwereeatenbyalid kiryu punches them into the shadow realm
[2:14:21] <%shiplord13> We now find out he had sex with his wife immediately after this
[2:14:25] <+Birdigalore> Seeeegaaaaa
[2:14:26] <%Promessa_EX> kill sega
[2:14:27] <InugamiTheHound> @Raidou24 yes off screen
[2:14:28] <PortableBoredom> That man was named Sega
[2:14:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> the angle of that kick made no sense
[2:14:32] <%Ilpala271> kiryu did a runup to a dropkick in an entirely different direction
[2:14:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> this symbolizes that kiryu got fed up and actually started to kill people
[2:14:34] <@lewdskeletor13> @raidou24 Yes
[2:14:35] <$cureneckbeard> Like 30% of this town is yakuza
[2:14:40] <$Valdorick> He's gotta go fast - the hospital for the internal bleeding!
[2:14:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @InugamiTheHound Do you honestly think pocket circut racer has only one car?
[2:14:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like how Kiryu just runs up and dropkicks a bunch of guys for no reason
[2:14:45] <maria_luke> Promessa no.... well, maybe.
[2:14:47] <+Raidou24> Ah cool thanks
[2:14:50] <%Dementedpenguin> @snow_bush the fact that Kiryu hasn't cameod in a fighting game yet is kinda mindblowing
[2:14:53] <natebud> Man pat really loves that temporary buff.
[2:14:53] <%NWR_James> HES FINE
[2:14:58] <%MagickBurritoh> Those sparklies

[2:15:02] <Vakojin> Does Pat knows that if after a grab he press L1 or L2, can't remember wich one, he can change the grabbing stance ?

[2:18:22] <+Taglog7> Pepridge Farm
[2:18:22] <FenixSeraph> wouldn't she catch hypothermia
[2:18:23] <xeros720> TSET was staffed and ran by assholes, so who cares

[2:18:37] <+Manjove> Kiryu is the father
[2:18:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> @FenixSeraph Usually people end up that wy in surgery
[2:18:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @FenixSeraph for easy access in case sheneeds more surgery?

[2:18:44] <%Niney_Who> Where's the baby
[2:18:44] <%Laecerelius> TSET deserved to die and I hope they burn in Hell!
[2:18:45] <+dukenux> Kiss the bar lady, you fool
[2:18:46] <xiidrifty> Haruka didn't kill T-Set, Pewdiepie did
[2:18:48] <majindusto> THEY WERE AWFUL ANYWAYS SO FUCK EM
[2:18:49] <simulationbard> I am the father
[2:18:51] <%MagickBurritoh> She's the father
[2:18:52] <InugamiTheHound> hearing that crow reminds me of the furry dating game "morenatsu"
[2:18:52] <%shiplord13> Damn
[2:18:52] <@lewdskeletor13> BITCH YOU LUING
[2:18:54] <mar_krow> probably save tset from worse things
[2:18:55] <FenixSeraph> they probably had that 2 Haruka model in preparation for the Kiwami 2 make
[2:19:00] <%NWR_James> this ropeway that leads to...the ropeway station
[2:19:01] <GenericSoda> @xiidrifty WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
[2:19:11] <+moondog_> by the HABAH
[2:19:12] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Down by the HAAABAR?
[2:19:12] <%snow_bush> @xiidrifty Did she tell me to subscribe to him before she killed her career?
[2:19:12] <%shiplord13> I don't hit women... most of the time.
[2:19:14] <%drabberfaun535> !uptime
[2:19:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 19m.
[2:19:15] <sphereshots12> He's used to it by now
[2:19:24] <alexandrecau> suicidal haruka
[2:19:29] <xiidrifty> @GenericSoda t-series joke
[2:19:30] <Snarksmith> and then werewolves carry bar lady away
[2:19:38] <r_Foeburden87> so when did this shit happen? She left from living with Kiryu like a year ago ?
[2:19:38] <+moondog_> @shiplord13 yeah MOST of the time
[2:19:44] <GenericSoda> dont hit women, dont hit women with guns, also dont shoot women, this is what yakuza taught me
[2:19:46] <Zombrocom> Man that necklace is painted on
[2:19:46] <%MagickBurritoh> and then they FUCKED
[2:19:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Kiryu gets lied to so often
[2:19:48] <+Manjove> This is WEREWOLF Country
[2:19:49] <%shiplord13> If she killed herself Kiryu would kill a lot of pople
[2:19:50] <$MonsterEnvy> 3 years ago
[2:19:50] <+tigerfang86> SHE'S THE DAD
[2:19:50] <arkv01> alwaysa have a spare futon
[2:20:01] <jorgeniev> and then she got preggers by that guy
[2:20:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Snarksmith Man Kiryu would kill the werewolf with his bare hands
[2:20:05] <alexandrecau> @r_Foeburden87 kiryu was in jail for five years after yakuza 5
[2:20:18] <GenericSoda> nah 3 years
[2:20:18] <+Manjove> Kiryu is the father
[2:20:19] <%shiplord13> Gee you sure, her almost killing herself didn't imply something was wrong
[2:20:19] <Nina96> so when baby though?
[2:20:20] <%Promessa_EX> uh
[2:20:22] <Snarksmith> I didn't say Kiryu wouldn't survive, just that she'd get carried off
[2:20:23] <r_Foeburden87> I understand ok
[2:20:26] <person181> then she made a baby
[2:20:30] <ミュウレ4242> kiryu is the kind of guy to become a WoD werewolf.
[2:20:38] <%zoogzin> Of course, no way having a cute former idol at your bar would be good for business
[2:20:40] <ShichiNoBushi> Unlike real idols who are two-faced.
[2:20:43] <%Kataguro> You KNEW?
[2:20:43] <Tucker0603> My Problem is that this all starts cause Haruka is being a dumb dumb, but oh well.
[2:20:46] <+griffball13> then she fucked
[2:20:48] <alexandrecau> the whole town lied for her
[2:20:49] <count_bob> And then she got TEEN PREGNANT
[2:20:52] <%Zamorouskiwhich> THAT day
[2:20:59] <arkv01> wait what
[2:21:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> I thought it was established Kiryu is a Ripple user

[2:21:41] <%snow_bush> Kiryu's stand is simple, it turns off other stands so he can punch people
[2:21:42] <+moondog_> that day she grew a PENOR and got Haruka GREGNANT
[2:21:42] <ChungusQuest> When they say Majima Everywhere, they mean it

[2:34:53] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Pretty much
[2:34:54] <%shiplord13> That should work well
[2:34:55] <danknugglit> Do combo!
[2:34:56] <Cranky_Construct> Kiryu's version of stealth is a mean right hook
[2:34:59] <%stabbityrabbit> It's like a robbing, except they don't steal anything. Just murder.
[2:35:01] <juxtest> Kiryu, you'll go in the front and kill evetybody
[2:35:02] <%Zamorouskiwhich> He'll be on the roof. Calling it now.
[2:35:03] <$Brother_Coduss> Kiryu gets to cosplay as a Luchador
[2:35:04] <Johno_san> is this the granny or daughter?
[2:35:05] <mesamus> guys its super obvious she's at the top
[2:35:05] <+XxBTExX> GO in the women's bathroom and punch them.
[2:35:07] <%theAncopro> everyone gets a floor each oh boy
[2:35:07] <PortableBoredom> Here's the plan: Slap everyone in the eyes
[2:35:09] <natebud> Then we transmit our message to the androids.
[2:35:11] <aizt> did the yakuzies steal da baby too, and everyone is just focused on the lady?
[2:35:13] <+dukenux> Stealth is optional, fellas
[2:35:15] <%zoogzin> yup
[2:35:17] <Malziel> LUL
[2:35:18] <alexandrecau> a plan that takes five minute of screentime is doomed to fail later in the gasme
[2:35:19] <ミュウレ4242> they'll never see it coming.
[2:35:19] <+PenmanLupine> I think thats their plan too

[2:35:26] <%templar010> thats your hokage way
[2:35:27] <%Solidnick18> all good
[2:35:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> At this point even if Kyrio had like a body suit with a mask that hadeye glasses and a voice modulator, he probably has a blowing aura around him that every Yakuza can sense for a kilometer radios that screams "THE DRAGON OF DOJIMA!"
[2:35:28] <simulationbard> Is Beat Takeshi watching the baby

[2:51:11] <frozenottsel> I'm gonna get a YoRHa tattoo one day
[2:51:11] <alexandrecau> that's a real thing by the way, modern yakuza give up on tatoo because it gets them profiled
[2:51:12] <%shiplord13> You are about to get your ass kicked by Kiryu
[2:51:15] <+XxBTExX> he has a fair point
[2:51:15] <%MagickBurritoh> no bitch
[2:51:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh shut up Kiryu the yakuza are stupid criminals

[2:51:19] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh my god, are you seriously trying to convince KIRYU that he should be a cynic?
[2:51:20] <omen_setter> abandon the rites and everything goes to shit
[2:51:20] <count_bob> I hate this guy.
[2:51:23] <vergil_angelo> Reminder that Shibusawa and Ryuji fought Kiryu over a tattoo
[2:51:23] <%Remery_> smart bboi
[2:51:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> THE DREAM OF CRIME
[2:51:24] <%zanzibar_junker> fair point
[2:51:26] <+CanonHusbando> what is the dream kiryu

[2:51:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> FIGHT THE WAY Kami-san intended
[2:51:30] <+PenmanLupine> Someya is a piece of shit but he's right
[2:51:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu there is no ideals THEY'RE CRIMINALS
[2:51:32] <%Kataguro> Kiryu, only you think this. None of the others think this.
[2:51:32] <T_Sasquatch> he's basically awano
[2:51:33] <skeletonknifefight> THE DREAM OF CRIME
[2:51:33] <FenixSeraph> what ideals?
[2:51:33] <natebud> All these years and Kiryu still doesn't know what the yakuza do
[2:51:35] <@lewdskeletor13> THE DREAM?
[2:51:36] <切捨御免> when was kiryu ever smart
[2:51:36] <%Remery_> Old and Stubborn

[2:51:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> I don't like tattoos but fuck this guy
[2:51:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I find it hard to argue with him
[2:51:39] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat this is legit a part of yakuza culture tho, isnt it?
[2:51:40] <%AncelDeLambert> CRIME DO BIG CRIME, Kiryu!
[2:51:42] <Amasepyt> A gang is about FRIENDSHIP and RESPECT

[2:51:43] <+griffball13> livin da dream
[2:51:45] <AirlineFood74> THE DREAM OF CRIME

[2:51:57] <CastellanVon> Kiryu is such a fuckin dinosaur
[2:51:58] <juxtest> Why be a yakuza at all if you just want to be a businessman
[2:52:00] <%Remery_> New Generation
[2:52:00] <%krispen_wa> Remember wehn the Yakuza upheld the ideals of murder and rape
[2:52:01] <Pookiedaexzile> This game thinks yakuza means samurai and it will not be swayed

[3:02:14] <%Kataguro> This old man will fuck your shit up. He's got super powers and boat strength probably
[3:02:16] <%Laecerelius> This is a murder boat
[3:02:17] <%lovebass4stuff> kill the old man
[3:02:17] <alwayspronking> Drown the boat itself!
[3:02:17] <ミュウレ4242> you probably won't guess it. it's rather twisty.
[3:02:18] <%manwithboxonhead> The Implication?
[3:02:18] <InugamiTheHound> blow it up
[3:02:18] <%Edgy_Macaroon> probably
[3:02:18] <Deadbulky> Feels like the get dssapeared boat
[3:02:18] <Nina96> probably
[3:02:19] <%shiplord13> You could
[3:02:19] <$Valdorick> Fuck that, Drown the BOAT
[3:02:19] <TranquilTurnip> Kiryu could eat this boat
[3:02:20] <+reddpop_> the IMPLICATIONS

[3:02:22] <$Valdorick> its the perfect crime.
[3:02:22] <omen_setter> unleash your inner Robert Wagner
[3:02:23] <%Nobrev> THE IMPLICATION
[3:02:23] <kingra> He certainly could
[3:02:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> I bet you could drown the boat itsel god damn it
[3:02:23] <natebud> We just went to a different table, BUT ON A BOAT
[3:02:25] <simulationbard> Just break their legs and toss em off
[3:02:26] <BunnyEmperor> Technically you could but the plot makes them immortal right now so ... yeah
[3:02:26] <ZofoJackson> Now he can't refuse, because of the implication
[3:02:26] <joneworldbeater> I bet the old man is super ripped
[3:02:26] <devanmuse> What was the point of meeting in the penthouse if you were just going to move the whole table to this boat?
[3:02:28] <%Ilpala271> that old man is at most twenty years older than kiryu
[3:02:28] <arkv01> @Youwereeatenbyalid Kreygasm too many unspeakable tags
[3:02:28] <+Chronobot> Theres a women involved, this boat is gonna explode
[3:02:30] <a_mad_dragon> kiryu could just PUNCH THE BOAT UNDERWATER
[3:02:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> oh????
[3:02:31] <+miguelrod777> THIS MAN IS HEIHACHI
[3:02:31] <st_jimmy456> except for the bug in the cabin

[3:02:33] <vincent_von_helsing> DROWN EVERYBODY
[3:02:33] <$shurtal> i wanna see what the car ride to the marina was like
[3:02:33] <%Kataguro> Alright man
[3:02:33] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Kiryu literally just sails the boat back alone in like an hour
[3:02:35] <person181> what about the giant squid that lurks in these waters
[3:02:36] <mar_krow> while getting shot and living like a hero
[3:02:37] <+theoldgodcthulu> What a first thought from Pat on a boat
[3:02:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I feel like Kiryu is literally a twitch away from just nuking this entire boat.
[3:02:38] <RupanSen> He has the whole Berserk Boat arc drawn on his back
[3:02:38] <vincent_von_helsing> drown everyone
[3:02:40] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat kiryu could sink the fucking boat before they could stop him
[3:02:40] <%Dementedpenguin> ......
[3:02:40] <VickyEnd> ??!!
[3:02:41] <%BakedPretzels> hey has pat read donations yet
[3:02:42] <vincent_von_helsing> Do it
[3:02:43] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat watch out for the water ninjas spying damn albheds
[3:02:44] <Daxalog> Theres probably snipers watching this boat like a hawk. Along with men on speed boats ready to get speed over.
[3:02:45] <+dukenux> Yakuza merger?
[3:02:46] <danknugglit> Hes anime old hes the most swole
[3:02:49] <$cureneckbeard> he cut his nice dinner short for this
[3:02:51] <JumbleJams> you must confirm this wedding
[3:02:51] <natebud> ironic given our name
[3:02:59] <vincent_von_helsing> Drown everyone here
[3:02:59] <Tucker0603> Is this like a gay pact?
[3:02:59] <%Kataguro> @BakedPretzels He did pre-stream donations. No break yet
[3:03:01] <GenericSoda> koshimizu would probably fuck you up
[3:03:02] <TranquilTurnip> You're about to learn boat style
[3:03:07] <%Solidnick18> sbfpRichard
[3:03:08] <FenixSeraph> is he beefy like Sagawa?
[3:03:10] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Kiryu could take over Japan before anyone can stop him
[3:03:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> C O N V A L U T E D
[3:03:17] <%Niney_Who> But MAJIMA is in the OMI
[3:03:19] <%narusao> he's got the whole yakuza wooorld in his hands ~
[3:03:26] <%BakedPretzels> @kataguro thank you sir
[3:03:28] <+Manjove> they are the KeyStone of crime
[3:03:29] <President_valentine> Majima is tojo
[3:03:29] <+3InchMensch> Majima's Tojo
[3:03:31] <alexandrecau> majima is not in the omi
[3:03:33] <natebud> Tojo clan wants it's own navy
[3:03:33] <%Niney_Who> Nevermind
[3:03:35] <+3InchMensch> and in prison
[3:03:37] <%Niney_Who> My bad was thinking of 0
[3:03:38] <omen_setter> in anime years, Kiryu is 25, Kurusu is 26.
[3:03:41] <%shiplord13> @Niney_Who Majima isn't Omi he is TOjo
[3:03:45] <$Valdorick> I always think about what must happen between the line "Lets go somewhere else" and then the cut to them somewhere far away, and you just have to think... how awkward is that boat ride?... Like, is it Skullface staring at you for 5 minutes straight awkward?
[3:03:45] <juxtest> And then nobody would buy the boats
[3:03:46] <JumbleJams> but money tho
[3:03:54] <Deadbulky> Even kiryu asks
[3:03:54] <Mr_LupLup> Dude i JUST wanna know who fucked my daughter
[3:03:54] <%Jetsfantasy> But $$$
[3:03:55] <+miguelrod777> Majima and kiryu are the sole reasons tojo even still exists
[3:04:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Valdorick they all drink quietly
[3:04:01] <vincent_von_helsing> How about everyone just make an alliance with everyone?
[3:04:03] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Nah
[3:04:04] <ミュウレ4242> i can't wait to see kiryu fight a sailor w/ an anchor tatoo.
[3:04:04] <Run44forrest> thats stupid
[3:04:09] <%shiplord13> He is literally in prison with Daigo the actual Tojo Chairmen
[3:04:09] <alexandrecau> and majima is in jail
[3:04:10] <Prism_Wing> Just stop being criminals and save society :)
[3:04:10] <%ace_cfa44> but war already because triads and korean mafia?
[3:04:10] <Tucker0603> It's their gay wedding
[3:04:11] <%NWR_James> Just a reminder he's here cuz Haruka has a kid
[3:04:13] <natebud> The man who controls the boats controls the world!
[3:04:14] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat Why does kiryu even care about any of this? he came for the girl, he should just be killing these fools
[3:04:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah because he did some shit
[3:04:19] <%Kataguro> Huh, that's actually pretty smart, Kurusu
[3:04:20] <redial_nick> fanboys of course
[3:04:22] <%snow_bush> I think its less respect and more fear
[3:04:25] <person181> boat guy should have popeye on his back
[3:04:27] <kerotuyu> Has Kiryu become a fishing god and killed the shark, yet?
[3:04:28] <%MagickBurritoh> no it doesnt
[3:04:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> huh
[3:04:31] <%Zamorouskiwhich> It does?
[3:04:36] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @snow_bush truth
[3:04:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Greatest Yakuza in the world, Kazuma Kiryu
[3:04:41] <vincent_von_helsing> The shark is gonna come and kill everyone on the boat
[3:04:45] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYE
[3:04:46] <%Edgy_Macaroon> he refuse bitch
[3:04:50] <%Kataguro> Time to fight, fuck
[3:04:51] <takiyami> He could not care less
[3:04:51] <Run44forrest> angery
[3:04:51] <切捨御免> >:(
[3:04:52] <Mangoesarentcats> CRAZY TALK
[3:04:52] <AirlineFood74> HE PASSES
[3:04:53] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh My God
[3:04:54] <SilverFaustX> baby is like 4yrs old by now
[3:04:55] <+HeroesDieInVain> Kiryu cares way too much about everything
[3:04:56] <+JackMillerTime> if he stops caring it gets worse
[3:04:58] <vincent_von_helsing> FIGHT ON THE BOAT
[3:04:58] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> CRAZY TALKU
[3:04:58] <arkv01> its like when you quit drugs but the allure to get back in is always there
[3:04:59] <%shiplord13> Now Kiryu drown them all
[3:04:59] <fearhurst> Is kiryu about to put his hoodie up like jin
[3:05:00] <@commanderclaw> Yakuza are drawn to each other like Stand Users
[3:05:01] <%Piemen99> Did the tired 40 year old man find his daughter?
[3:05:06] <+Taglog7> PogChamp
[3:05:07] <omen_setter> he can't help but help
[3:05:15] <sphereshots12> He's always angry
[3:05:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu is playing politics
[3:05:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Again with the Tojo
[3:05:16] <%MagickBurritoh> YEAH
[3:05:20] <%Kataguro> "You right"
[3:05:23] <GoldeNOVA> It's treason, then
[3:05:23] <+Tarkara> I must consult the Elder Gods
[3:05:24] <%Over_ninek> Kiryu used his brain!
[3:05:24] <person181> yakuza tattos are their stands
[3:05:24] <Deadbulky> big smarts
[3:05:24] <%zoogzin> Damn, Kiryu knows basic politics
[3:05:25] <+HappiestFace> kiryu can do business aswell
[3:05:25] <+JackMillerTime> think of all the people left unstopped if kiryu didnt care
[3:05:25] <$Brother_Coduss> how is it treason if he ISNT A YAKUZA ANY MORE
[3:05:27] <natebud> Kiryu cares because he knows that everything in a yakuza story is important and some random coincidence will tie Haruka to the boats.
[3:05:29] <%MagickBurritoh> or wait to do it
[3:05:29] <skeletonknifefight> you commit treason all the time
[3:05:30] <jinking79> he left the yakuza life
[3:05:30] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Oh, what a shame
[3:05:34] <Run44forrest> yeah fuck him
[3:05:36] <+dukenux> See, Old Man is also all about the rules
[3:05:37] <%HiroTSK5> You've commited like ten Treasons against the Tojo
[3:05:37] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> "Oh No. I don't care."
[3:05:40] <%Kataguro> Kiryu will kick all of their asses too
[3:05:41] <Tucker0603> So fuck off
[3:05:44] <InugamiTheHound> tojo will be weaker
[3:05:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He was Fourth Chainrman for like 6 hours!
[3:05:52] <fearhurst> haruka has been living on a fishing trawler
[3:05:53] <+Xeno351> fuck these guys
[3:05:54] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Fucking THANK YOU Kiryu!
[3:05:58] <ToastedAeolo> I'm glad someone pointed it out lol
[3:05:59] <VaudevilleVillain93> He just doesn't want the next generation of Tojo to be weak bitches
[3:06:00] <%Over_ninek> hey Kazuma is breathing now
[3:06:03] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> OBJECTlON
[3:06:03] <%MagickBurritoh> OH NO LOGIC
[3:06:07] <TranquilTurnip> muh Honor
[3:06:11] <%Piemen99> GUN
[3:06:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Old man understands
[3:06:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> New young men don't understand
[3:06:21] <alexandrecau> Tsuneo calling out Kiryu's bullshit
[3:06:23] <%lovebass4stuff> someone is going to die
[3:06:25] <alrobot2014> if he isn't with the tojo how do his words have any weight here either way
[3:06:25] <+dukenux> Two Old Honorable Yakuza men
[3:06:28] <+Xeno351> OLD MAN at least seems to have some honor
[3:06:30] <takiyami> Evil old man, oddly enough, understands honor
[3:06:31] <%Kataguro> I kind of like Kurusu. He seems cool.
[3:06:32] <Pookiedaexzile> WElp looks like Kiryus swimming home
[3:06:37] <maverickdrifter> Nah fuck this glasses nerd
[3:06:40] <%MagickBurritoh> wtf

[3:06:42] <maverickdrifter> Stuff him in a locker kiryu
[3:06:44] <VanLynx> awkward meal
[3:06:45] <silvcrest> Everyone is tired
[3:06:45] <DXLelouch24> and if the Omi fucks with Kamurocho he'll just kill them too
[3:06:45] <+Manjove> BACK TO HOTEL
[3:06:46] <+HappiestFace> lmao FUCK THIS NERD
[3:06:51] <+ArcLifth> That old dude seems like the type of person to just shoot someone

[3:06:59] <natebud> it wasn't a car accident. It was a boat accident!
[3:07:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Two tired old men sick of everyones sick

[3:07:10] <Vakojin> Old "honorable" yakuzis" vs young yakuzis
[3:07:11] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> what a moron
