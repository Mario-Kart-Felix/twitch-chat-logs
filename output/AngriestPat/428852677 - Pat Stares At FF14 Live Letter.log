[0:14:30] <+RCresham> Reminder that if you're getting into 14, the Crystal Tower questline is marked as optional but it's SUPER IMPORTANT

[0:14:39] <BideoPear> @Valison I believe NIN remains the most in-demand job.

[0:15:30] <CassidyAlacrity> @AngriestPat Do you have to buy the expansions in order or can I skip to Shadow Bringers? I beat the base game and quit years ago but missed all the expansions.
[0:15:30] <veldinmusic> FUCK THAT I NEED MONEY
[0:15:32] <%stovetopism> Wait theyre adding a single player mode?
[0:15:32] <eanscrale> soul can't feed you
[0:15:35] <$Vilecrow> @spades3 yes, ff14 is a decent starter mmorpg. either 14 or wow
[0:15:36] <eanscrale> you can't level up
[0:15:37] <+ravenrooke> @angriestpat this is my second time trying to get into the game. the MSQ is very slow for ARR. would you recommend powering through or using skip potion? thank you!

[0:16:21] <Jermatoo> @ravenrooke Do the MSQ, ARR's is the shittiest story but HW really ramps up. Doing a level boost ruins the better portions of the story.

[0:17:27] <corepercentlives> @angriestpat where is le cube
[0:17:28] <CybertronPrime> POTD, Roulettes
[0:17:28] <$grotto_kein> Like 20 years old for kugga that is
[0:17:29] <BunnyEmperor> The same way you level up anything else
[0:17:30] <+Implosivestar> @AngriestPat would you consider using eye glass wipes to clean your controller? Why or why not? I'm poor or I'd donate to ask this :(
[0:17:33] <Jermatoo> @ravenrooke No problem friendo, I just beat ARR a month ago and I'm just telling you from firsthand experience. rooLove
[0:17:33] <BYAKURENLOVER763> kuuga still the best
[0:17:35] <RebelliousPawn> Squad missions are the fastest way to level DPS.

[0:18:14] <KatabolicRage> palace of the dead is efficient but it gets so boring
[0:18:16] <floatRand> Just do roulettes, especially if you are not a DPS

[0:18:19] <%manwithboxonhead> Ah shit
[0:18:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Be aware of this before you get into FFXIV everyone, I've heard that Shadowbringer will be the last expansion for the game
[0:18:20] <baesoora> I did it with Hunt logs and Palace :)
[0:18:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Also do the novice network tutorials! You need that ring.
[0:18:21] <%NotGran> first fate and hunting log til 15 dungeon spam til 50 then POD to 61 after is HOH
[0:18:24] <$valriot> 1-60 Exp is pretty fuckin good now, just do dungeons and hunt log/hunt marks
[0:18:26] <%Mev852_> does potd really give xp?
[0:18:28] <+einterblathnir> pat are you streaming the whole thing?
[0:18:28] <%Ascethetic> first was correct too
[0:18:29] <bestwaifuritsu> definitely finish up your hunt logs early on, they give tons of exp for just killing enemies
[0:18:31] <@SSaryn> Hunting Log gives absurd amounts thanks to the 300% EXP you get from 1-50
[0:18:32] <Jakeofalco> @RosELLo6 cheers bud
[0:18:33] <BootyFriend> @AngriestPat How is the game's economy? Rather, how grindy is it to get viable or meta gear?
[0:18:38] <RosELLo6> POTD 51-60 EXP is really good
[0:18:39] <KatabolicRage> I have all my combat classes at 70 and I couldn't be happier to never have to set foot in palace of the dead ever again

[0:18:45] <Zer0beats> yeyeye
[0:18:45] <zipfile777> LUL
[0:18:46] <silver__viii> Oh wait no Squadrons, do Command missions, especially as DPS, they give you a ton of exp since exp buffs apply there
[0:18:47] <+BioHunter> msq roulette gives good exp
[0:18:48] <+mercado94> the fuck was that
[0:18:49] <RosELLo6> like, 51-60 floors of POTD
[0:18:50] <marvel877> da fuq?
[0:18:51] <BunnyEmperor> Intermission
[0:18:52] <%Arnschen> If you can get dungeons as a DPS
[0:18:52] <SweetCuppingCake> Get a healer or tank to run stuff with you to minimize queue time
[0:18:53] <%ElenaManetta> You answer Fuggins right now
[0:18:54] <+Pendlez> also dungeons will give you the time to practice your role
[0:18:54] <%manwithboxonhead> WHAT
[0:18:54] <%averageliftsdonequick> For alt jobs Squadron Command missions are better exp than PotD
[0:18:54] <Bailey__gaming> Hey @AngriestPat if i want to play this mmo what is the cheapest way to buy all the content i need?
[0:18:55] <%templar010> I have to still get through SB story
[0:18:58] <+GladiaCelt> @AngriestPat I've been playing since january of last year because seeing you play stormblood on release got me excited. Lately though I find it more tiresome and troublesome to play again, but I don't want to believe that I'm no longer enjoying the game. Is there anything that can be done to help with this or is this something that can be fixed with shadowbringers being released?
[0:19:00] <$valriot> PotD is always exp honestly
[0:19:01] <+HobeBryant> As a DPS run dungeons with squadron, its WAY faster than trying to queue
[0:19:01] <alrobot2014> was that from memories of tokyo-to?
[0:19:02] <TunyNinja> How long does 60-70 take? I'm about to hit 60
[0:19:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What is a "roulette"??
[0:19:03] <BideoPear> @AngriestPat An alternative to the FC XP bonus is the Squadron Battle Manual, gained from sending your squad out on a specific mission. It's a 30% XP bonus for an hour, but it doesn't stack with the FC bonus.
[0:19:05] <+kawaiitatertot> Hey Pat, hope you doing good
[0:19:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> OH
[0:19:08] <Calamity2007> Is there a minimum level you have to be to run POTD?
[0:19:09] <RebelliousPawn> No one ever mentions leveling up your squad to run dungeons. It's so much faster and you get so much XP. =(
[0:19:11] <%MyDarkStorm> @AngriestPat Hey pat have you see some of the Leaks
[0:19:12] <+BioHunter> 60-70 is heaven on high
[0:19:12] <%actual_scum> @AngriestPat I can't tank for shit and Crystal's Free Companies are either too relaxed to raid/roulette or are RP-centered. How do I go about learning to tank properly without begging PUGs to teach me?
[0:19:13] <delicious_mystery> Hey pat how about gergorgarmartin working with fromsoft instead of FINISHING THE GOD DAMN BOOK
[0:19:17] <haveswordmuststing> also listen to a podcast or talk over discord, there will come a time where you need SOMETHING to pass the time when its almost auto piloy
[0:19:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> Squadron Missions if you're DPS
[0:19:20] <%thesoddenknight> My pal started DRK last knight the name of every knew ability hurt me there was actually so much edge
[0:19:21] <%HentaiSenpai9K> But what if someone is in danger Pat?
[0:19:23] <%nmaten> 15
[0:19:23] <+Kurogane_Dread> no
[0:19:24] <Broand> Should I wait until the new expansion before buying all the expansions?
[0:19:25] <hydragoon513> potd is 1
[0:19:25] <%Taisuru> Yes, 15
[0:19:26] <%apostateCourier> nope, 1
[0:19:26] <%MyDarkStorm> NO
[0:19:26] <@SSaryn> Oh also if you're leveling DPS, expect 15m queues no matter what
[0:19:28] <%Supertoaster02> also the xp boost earrings
[0:19:28] <+RCresham> There's a guide out there that you can find that tells you how to level from 1 to 70 in like a week with like five to six hours of play a day
[0:19:29] <%Arnschen> Nope
[0:19:29] <$valriot> Beast Tribes at 60 at AMAZINY for EXP
[0:19:29] <%Jacobblast> I’ve been trying to set my pc up to watch this on the big screen for 30 mins and the problem I’ve been having is BOTH power to my PC and monitor were not plugged in. I’m a computer science major so this is a massive disappointment
[0:19:29] <silver__viii> Squadrons for DPS are actually the best exp method outside of roulettes and dungeon spam
[0:19:29] <%Ascethetic> 15
[0:19:29] <Sydin18> nope, 1
[0:19:29] <%detsuahxe> Yes, it's 15
[0:19:30] <Tucker0603> no
[0:19:30] <bestwaifuritsu> it is 15 to unlock the quest
[0:19:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Angry_Ev1L Is it false? If so I'm glad cause I don't want FFXIV to stop getting new content
[0:19:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> hope you've been stocking up on those squadron battle manuals for shadowbringers
[0:19:31] <+RCresham> But that's hard
[0:19:31] <+cvp5127> What's the best class to solo with?
[0:19:32] <%BlancoRico> you have to get to floor 50
[0:19:32] <hydragoon513> 15 is to unlock it the first time
[0:19:33] <+lucaflow> 15
[0:19:35] <SweetCuppingCake> You gotta unlock it at 50 though
[0:19:35] <Lurantis_> Holy shit chat’s moving fast and each message is a PARAGRAPH
[0:19:37] <%Nanocomputer> U have to get there, so lv 15
[0:19:37] <jimmytwofeet> hey PAT
[0:19:38] <+Kurogane_Dread> You can unlock it at Lv. 15, but you can run it at Lv. 1
[0:19:39] <snowmanse> You have to at least be high enough to unlock it, but running it has no level requirement
[0:19:39] <%Nikopol1717> Once you've unlocked it you can start at 1
[0:19:39] <%blue_cloak552> 17 to unlock it but after that no
[0:19:40] <%Arnschen> After you unlock you're good
[0:19:40] <Tucker0603> can do it at lvl 1
[0:19:40] <@commanderclaw> Oh wow, I started last night and I'm already 15
[0:19:41] <+EvilSoully> MAKE DRAGOON GREAT AGAIN
[0:19:41] <%MoraMiarty> I ran PotD as a lvl 1 archer
[0:19:42] <+TheBroletariat> 15 to unlock but after that you can go in at 1
[0:19:46] <+BioHunter> 15 unlocks potd, after that theres no limit
[0:19:47] <%MoraMiarty> its can be run at 1
[0:19:48] <%MyDarkStorm> Yes PLD Does get one
[0:19:49] <BideoPear> You need level 15 to unlock it, but after unlock you can enter at level 1.
[0:19:50] <Calamity2007> Note I am not asking the level to unlock it for the first time but once you unlock it
[0:19:50] <+Pendlez> my precious whm rework better be good
[0:19:51] <+BlankMemory26> lvl 17 unlocks the quest, but you can start a class as low as lvl 1 to do potd
[0:19:51] <%thesoddenknight> Grammar go way down
[0:19:51] <prisefighter1188> ok cool I'm hoping to get to 60 with my rdm soon so I can get into hoh
[0:19:53] <$valriot> Dadadin
[0:19:56] <%terminallyCapriciousz> PotD gets unlocked at 15, if you have the thing unlocked and the warp point you can go at level 1
[0:19:57] <+blackjack45> 15 or so to unlock potd, then no requirement to run it
[0:19:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> Dragoon's already great >_>
[0:19:59] <@mothmandraws> how many lewd mods has pat loaded up
[0:20:00] <bestwaifuritsu> I hope they make DRK fun again
[0:20:00] <+torusendor> Try running pvp if you can stand it
[0:20:01] <FstSergeant8595> There really are not a whole lot of options for leveling after you have already leveled once
[0:20:02] <%Ragin_Asian06> @AngriestPat Do you recommend going through the original story first or run the latest dungeon Im at before progressing into more difficult areas?

[0:21:08] <tanarath> @AngriestPat I've tried to get into FFXIV several times but the disconnect between the MSQ and side questing always turns me off due to the massive difference in tone. Should I passively level via dungeons and the like (levees etc) or are there decent guides out there?

[0:22:09] <KatabolicRage> I hate pet classes so much, this would be the one thing to make me throw my spear in a trashcan
[0:22:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @Angry_Ev1L Upon closer inspection, it will be the last expansion that Yoshi-P will be working on cause he will be transferred esle where but it probably won't be the last for the game itself

[0:24:56] <+RCresham> Reminder that Heavensward is literally free right now
[0:24:59] <切捨御免> yay
[0:24:59] <Calamity2007> Jokes aside DRG is a pretty damn good class
[0:25:00] <bruno_silv0> man heavensward story is better than most final fantasy games

[0:25:02] <切捨御免> not ear rape
[0:25:04] <@SSaryn> @aeogard You're still never not gonna be called a Floor Tank.
[0:25:05] <bestwaifuritsu> Broand dont buy more than you can handle, itll take you quite a bit to reach the later expansions

[0:25:13] <tanarath> It's not ear-rape.
[0:25:13] <cizal11> there's some reverb but it's better
[0:25:14] <NoirePanzer> DRG is best floor inspector
[0:25:14] <%CitrusDrink> They did it!

[0:25:18] <prisefighter1188> @actual_scum how can they have a whole orchestra and have poor sound quality

[0:25:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Maybe?
[0:25:53] <KatabolicRage> looks like he's jus doin some audio and camera tests at the mo
[0:25:54] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat Who is that guy and why does he look like an SMT protagonist? he's rad!
[0:25:54] <bestwaifuritsu> The Garleans are totally not nazis. They just want the world to not explode
[0:25:55] <Tomschiii> being a tank makes me anxious
[0:25:59] <@SSaryn> @aeogard At least you're not a RDM going that.
[0:26:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> Ishgard reconstruction this xpac

[0:26:12] <%Jacobblast> gun breaker is probably gonna be the first tank i try and then ill go for dark knight
[0:26:12] <Calamity2007> BLU is such a waste

[0:26:26] <b0nd0fs0uls> I had my doubts about FF14 before I started playing it but tanking in it is more fun than tanking in almost any other MMO I've played and DRK satisfies my edgelord needs
[0:26:27] <%apostateCourier> I was asking what you thought of the job as it is :v
[0:26:34] <Forester_Skippy> blue mage is already broken to all hell

[0:27:15] <+SirRoyco> @elenamanetta Housing heavily impacts server load, with any MMO
[0:27:16] <plushysceptile> @angriestpat How come you didn't talk about DSP in the stream during talk of 'does the creator owe anything?'. Dude cheated Patreon supporters by quitting the games he promised or straight up saying no even though they won the poll

[0:27:37] <%Arnschen> They are indeed talking
[0:27:38] <%theunforgivingsquid> @calamity2007 I was just thinking the same thing
[0:27:39] <papaguff> that might be happening because your phone has the "dial when raised to your ear" setting on

[0:45:49] <Valask> this is amazing
[0:45:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 45m 50s.

[0:45:55] <+oOZtkOo> it looks nice
[0:45:56] <bestwaifuritsu> it must be all that crystal static from the fucking tower LUL
[0:45:56] <DevinMayCry> They are literally too busy making the game? Can we be that naive?

[0:45:59] <ELJOVENBATALI> crazy talk did this somehow
[0:45:59] <cizal11> @AngriestPat they're streaming from san francisco instead of japan, so it's probably not the normal sound team for live letters. meaning it's all FUCKED.
[0:46:00] <Valask> I feel so bad for them
[0:46:00] <%Ixiah> thats pale blue
[0:46:01] <aimlesshealer> That's blue, Pat Kappa

[0:46:11] <+8BitReaper> the room there in was probably used for something else. At that time
[0:46:12] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> This is a cool as area tho

[0:50:01] <Delenay> what
[0:50:03] <thelaxinator> Yoshi just ranked up his limit break
[0:50:04] <nukle0nik> audio issue like that is probably super hard coded into the game and impossible to fix
[0:50:04] <demiface> Pat tell them
[0:50:04] <KoyFoster> Wow and mincraft have this problem. At least with Wow you can forceably fix it in game.
[0:50:04] <haveswordmuststing> tech, fugg
[0:50:05] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> she is very cute
[0:50:05] <Edible_Enthusiasm> And they don't know that about their own game, right?
[0:50:05] <theobble> that's happened to me
[0:50:05] <%QuadraticGravity> He's right
[0:50:07] <thwak> how long untill they restart the game?

[0:50:09] <aimlesshealer> Well that's dumb
[0:50:12] <floatRand> Doesn't really sound like a bug, more like issue with audio device managing in the game.
[0:50:12] <%crimsonharvest> and its not a bug its just a device enumerator that's not designed to dynamically swap ID's during runtime
[0:50:12] <TigerClaws12> sounds like good game design
[0:50:13] <%AncelDeLambert> that sounds like something they should FIX

[0:50:22] <SweetCuppingCake> Yup yup, this is true
[0:50:22] <%AncelDeLambert> what they SHOULD be doing is debugging
[0:50:23] <Macmo696> That's really bad
[0:50:25] <Basch71> this is a hold over from 1.0
[0:50:28] <SweetCuppingCake> Had this happen to me a few times

[1:05:29] <%JGardner88> This is the LL where YoshiP finally loses it
[1:05:29] <dragonsdragoon> Stolen from Twitter: YOSHIDA'S ABOUT TO HIT ENRAGE.
[1:05:30] <DXLelouch24> FF7*
[1:05:30] <+Nomicro4u> YE
[1:05:31] <thenix> More. More failure
[1:05:32] <+mercado94> it was from their audio mic
[1:05:33] <DevinMayCry> Thats how this gets worse is they cut the stream and someone pulls a DSP
[1:05:33] <@mothmandraws> I feel like im learning alot about ff14
[1:05:34] <Edible_Enthusiasm> CLICK CLICK
[1:05:35] <ghoumon> ResidentSleeper
[1:05:35] <%Stonebeard> Maybe we can travel to a shard where audio works
[1:05:35] <tanarath> It's probably two or three things.
[1:05:35] <Kyrill_PSN> no pat it was the mic at the TV
[1:05:35] <TwinBat> their goblins require it to be perfect, you know how it is pat
[1:05:36] <%snow_bush> Now the real question, will a future patch fix this?
[1:05:36] <+Nomicro4u> YE YE YE more STATIC
[1:05:36] <Snarksmith> This is poetry in motion
[1:05:36] <%vaporousTippler> This isn't even how the sausage is made. This is how you set the pig on fire.
[1:05:36] <flubber3d> no shut up it wasn't up to final fantasy 14 standards
[1:05:36] <zamzoph> MEOW
[1:05:36] <agadejobi> Jesus Christ, it actually broke again?
[1:05:37] <Macfine> inb4 accidental cut to pornography
[1:05:40] <haveswordmuststing> the streams working better than Machinest at least Kappa
[1:05:40] <chaosbuckle> @RocketBarrel Oh yeah. We're gonna be here for awhile.
[1:05:40] <%Remery_> a lot of static
[1:05:40] <Saterion> !uptime
[1:05:40] <worldbrand> I am genuinely shocked that there are 2000 of us

[1:05:41] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> I clooooooose my eyes, tell us why must we suffer~
[1:05:42] <bestwaifuritsu> static is back!
[1:05:43] <agadejobi> Someone is about to lose their job
[1:05:43] <+Nillard> They didn't set a noise gate did they?
[1:05:43] <theobble> i can hear people losing their jobs
[1:05:43] <FairOnFire> i can't hear shit
[1:05:43] <+mr_dangus> I can hear people getting fired
[1:05:44] <dukenux> I can't believe Crazy Talk affected other people's stream
[1:05:44] <Delenay> they just raised the mic sensitivity to catch the monitors sound?
[1:05:46] <DRAGKUDO> This is all according to plan. Yoshi is going to become the Dark Knight
[1:05:46] <+Jordan_z123> So this is what FF14 is huh
[1:05:46] <Louie_Salmon> @joeyjojo70 They already showed the desktop several times now

[1:05:47] <GhostPyre> These are professionals.
[1:05:48] <KatabolicRage> seriously though this should've been tested like an hour ago
[1:05:49] <%segbas2004> is "stream setup" the new FFXIV boss?
[1:05:50] <+HobeBryant> This is literally the same level as "oh no, you can see me in the reflection"
[1:05:50] <Fatman2124> If this was North Korea someone would be dead already!!
[1:05:51] <weeters> has any live letter been even close of a disaster as this one?
[1:05:51] <takiyami> @Macfine That would just be the icing on top
[1:05:51] <redial_nick> now you feel our pain
[1:05:53] <chaosbuckle> @Macfine XD

[1:07:17] <BunnyEmperor> Then DO IT
[1:07:18] <+JonnyCue> They forgot to uncheck that Windows 10 setting that makes things sound like garbage
[1:07:18] <%TenderBabyBacon> Yoshi is telling stream coordinators to go jump off the building

[1:08:10] <%ElenaManetta> OBS is probably the easiest streaming program to use on the planet. Even I can use it and I'm a fucking idiot
[1:08:12] <ZimmiZ> they might not be using obs
[1:08:12] <%iateadogonce> they have 6 more hours to fix it
[1:08:13] <%cTAKU> Can't they plug a jack into thte desktop headphones and work that way
[1:08:14] <+WhereIsWill> soo hype for the podcast omg

[1:08:16] <redeight8> clemps just broke into song about how bad this is
[1:08:17] <%HentaiSenpai9K> One Eternity Later
[1:08:18] <joeyjojo70> ! JOB AT RISK !
[1:08:19] <Prism_Wing> They should switch to Justin Tv
[1:08:22] <@mothmandraws> pat are you ready for them to alt tab and accidentaly show the script
[1:08:22] <cowardlord> Now I want the game
[1:08:23] <BunnyEmperor> "I only tell my staff what to do, I don't actually play the game"
[1:08:24] <Saterion> Stream was dead the whole time?
[1:08:24] <@SSaryn> Live Letter LI [Extreme]
[1:08:25] <Louie_Salmon> At least they're laughing
[1:08:26] <takiyami> I would feel sorry for that guy who's totally getting fired, but he probably deserves it at this point
[1:08:26] <Bladeexe> Looks like Sega does not need to feel bad about that Sonic stream from a couple years back now.
[1:08:26] <cherrysh3p> its giving YOU an anxiety attack? thancred's out here about to get fired
[1:08:27] <@commanderclaw> They might be using JPN software on US hardware
[1:08:27] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Told Clemps how much fun you're having with this
[1:08:31] <@mothmandraws> and spoil it all
[1:08:31] <+Super_General_Guy> That tech guy's "Final Fantasy" in flames shirt symbolises the stream perfectly
[1:08:32] <+WhereIsWill> @joeyjojo70 LUL
[1:08:32] <Kyrill_PSN> ! STOCK AT RISK !

[1:08:36] <%snow_bush> Skype for business
[1:08:37] <Delenay> click
[1:08:37] <Forester_Skippy> they are multi streaming to 3 sites tho
[1:08:39] <Snarksmith> Every time he comes on screen the Full Party sound should pla- Oh wait...
[1:08:39] <+8BitReaper> the question is, are they in full screen or borderless window
[1:08:40] <%Remery_> It's like regular Pat streams but professional :)
[1:08:41] <ghoumon> unregistered hypercam 2
[1:08:43] <Coffee_JD> Tony dou?
[1:08:43] <King_Krimzon> There's no way this could happen and somebody NOT be fired over it.
[1:08:44] <+Nomicro4u> Tony Tony
[1:08:45] <takiyami> @snow_bush lol
[1:08:46] <+Rolandknight> I guess that should happen when they hardly stream.
[1:08:48] <%Shikari21> how is this so bad
[1:08:49] <+oOZtkOo> yoshi p is becoming a warrior of darkness as we speak
[1:08:49] <$PhantomMiG> !uptime
[1:08:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 8m.
[1:08:51] <$Tuskor13> This is such a Ultrascuff
[1:08:51] <thelaxinator> 'member when woolie bought like 300 dollar streaming software and then had to dial back to OBS?
[1:08:52] <vinceshamwowslap> That's what I was thinking
[1:08:53] <Avoxis> Zoom business
[1:08:53] <%vivinxs> this went from sound testing (extreme) to sound testing ultimate
[1:08:54] <%ElenaManetta> When Pat reaches off camera while his sub animation goes, it looks like he's trying to pet the dancing Pat in Time
[1:08:54] <+Nomicro4u> Tony-san
[1:08:55] <AVelvetOwl> [Stream][Audio][Do you have it?]
[1:08:56] <RavenHellkite> it's how early access will look like
[1:08:56] <%Toynota10> Clemps had an amazing reaction to some of this
[1:08:57] <+HitoBeat> xsplit baybee
[1:08:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> So what are the chances that in all of their attempts to fix this, they've broken it beyond repair?
[1:08:58] <dukenux> Big Matte
[1:08:59] <KalinaAnn2> please understand
[1:09:01] <therakishsage> God, I can't watch this. This is too painful.

[1:09:08] <joeyjojo70> *Sound guy enters fog gate* YOSHI-P, SWINDLER OF CAREERS
[1:09:08] <Angry_Ev1L> How can't they solve this? It's not a rocket science lmao
[1:09:08] <matouci> I think they changed the ingame audio and didnt restart
[1:09:09] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Boomers Of The FAR EAST
[1:09:10] <%Silverstreakhg> Is it still going like this?
[1:09:11] <%Despera__> Get Clemps on a discord call!
[1:09:13] <b0nd0fs0uls> Yoshi P is just going to stand up and leave soon

[1:09:14] <TheOriginOfAll> OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO
[1:09:15] <切捨御免> YoshiP getting ready to let those Fell Cleaves rip

[1:09:20] <BappoSama> Like, can a basic laptop run it rather decently?
[1:09:20] <+ATentacleMonster> The woman on the left looks so upset LUL
[1:09:20] <dickbuttwoman> @Bladeexe As much as it was a disaster, it wasn't really anyone's fault. The sound system blew out 10 minutes before the show because a guest spilled some shit on an integral part, and the host's girlfriend broke her leg in the back like 5 minutes after the show started
[1:09:21] <%CuddlyZombie> Fumumu
[1:09:21] <Zer0beats> the wavvvves
[1:09:22] <drakepegasus> Unrelated, but there's a tornado forming over D.C. right now
[1:09:22] <Louie_Salmon> We did see the sound waves
[1:09:23] <chaosbuckle> Kill Bill siren is in Yoshi P's head right now
[1:09:24] <+Ell1ot> Soundwave is a transformer
[1:09:24] <$PhantomMiG> So when did the show start
[1:09:25] <%vaporousTippler> This is the LSD stream now.
[1:09:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Shinjiro120) (warning)
[1:09:26] <RavenHellkite> they're teasing how fucked early access will be
[1:09:26] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Sickness must be purged

[1:09:27] <%joylent_blue> "I'll everyone in this room and then myself. They'll thank me."
[1:09:27] <$birchpeninsula> I can see the soundwaves! they are coming from inside the house!
[1:09:28] <Forester_Skippy> those soundwaves are a new bard ability
[1:09:29] <Kravus> The memes on twitter are already getting good
[1:09:29] <+Grayhammatter> the SOUNDWAVES

[1:09:32] <+JEiddew> @griffinblade323 hilarious inability to understand their own software
[1:09:32] <+VietcongSamurai> Yoshi P will become a skeleton after this.
[1:09:32] <vinceshamwowslap> I'm never buying a final fantasy game again😠
[1:09:34] <%Arnschen> Ah, System SOunds
[1:09:34] <therakishsage> This poor man.

[1:09:36] <herfaintsmile> this poor dude
[1:09:37] <Zer0beats> Pat, IT WAS THE MIDOCONDIRA
[1:09:40] <+Comrade_Vladof> No one ever expected Yoshida's gunblade replica to actually work, until it was too late
[1:09:40] <vinceshamwowslap> jk
[1:09:41] <King_Krimzon> Like, their days are ruined.
[1:09:41] <zecht89> SOUNDUH WAAAAVUUUUH
[1:09:41] <%SlackerAlex> For once, Pat is on the other side of the tech issues
[1:09:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh, they seemed to have fled along with the script!
[1:09:43] <ghoumon> they bring up the screen and its just WoW classic
[1:09:43] <%MightyMaxT> Yoshi P is Woolie during Omikron

[1:45:17] <+JonnyCue> So this is going to become First Fantasy then?
[1:45:18] <%camodikk> camodikk subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:45:22] <Kingdom_65> Yoshi-P has already said that they most likely won't be adding new races because it's way too much fucking work
[1:45:23] <i_worship_his_shadow> they call me 2 tanks
[1:45:25] <%apostateCourier> wait a second
[1:45:26] <redeight8> PixelBob
[1:45:31] <%apostateCourier> are role quests replacing job quests
[1:45:32] <%QuadraticGravity> Samurai and RDM had 50-60 quests.
[1:45:33] <caribbean_samurai> @bestwaifuritsu is it Albert or Arbert?
[1:45:34] <ZimmiZ> so no more job quests?
[1:45:34] <Tucker0603> WHAT?!
[1:45:34] <+TheImmortal70> ONE QUEST
[1:45:37] <%Shadowthedigger> Awwwwww
[1:45:38] <Edible_Enthusiasm> thats weird right?
[1:45:38] <+Comrade_Vladof> LAME
[1:45:38] <%Taisuru> Aww
[1:45:39] <Tucker0603> THE FUCK?!
[1:45:39] <%VioletHeart> ...weird.
[1:45:42] <%Shadowthedigger> That's lame. :/
[1:45:42] <+Grayhammatter> oh? ONLY 80?
[1:45:42] <chaosbuckle> DAMMIT
[1:45:42] <%apostateCourier> role quests are REPLACING JOB QUESTS WHAT
[1:45:43] <CruxAustralis> no new mechanics

[1:45:45] <%gespenst25> wait have job quests been removed???? huh
[1:45:46] <+TheLink736> laaaame.
[1:45:46] <BunnyEmperor> Thats kinda scuffed
[1:45:46] <silver__viii> What? That's so weird
[1:45:47] <ZimmiZ> thats okay tbh
[1:45:48] <BusterWoIf> odd
[1:45:48] <%blastazoid26> Thats weird
[1:45:48] <Dastardry> lame
[1:45:49] <silver__viii> No lore?
[1:45:51] <$birchpeninsula> oooh
[1:45:51] <%decent_gaming> BOO
[1:45:51] <Tucker0603> LAME!!!!!!
[1:45:52] <PiCheese> booooo
[1:45:54] <+TheImmortal70> @apostatecourier Not at all
[1:45:54] <TioXyco> the ULTIMATE Quest
[1:45:54] <Greetings_Gentlemen> well...everyone is super dead
[1:45:56] <%Taisuru> MY LORE
[1:45:56] <Lotharman> Well, the more jobs, the more work they gotta put into the job quests.
[1:45:57] <GrandmasterBFunk> awwww no dark knight lore
[1:45:57] <Edible_Enthusiasm> like the blue mage job quest
[1:45:58] <juxtest> But there are so many more vampires for the Red Mage to slay
[1:45:58] <Kingdom_65> It probably means they won't lock skills behind job quests
[1:46:00] <JoshTheFace> ok?
[1:46:00] <%Farples> It better be
[1:46:02] <silver__viii> That is true yeah
[1:46:02] <$birchpeninsula> that's what they meant
[1:46:03] <poodo89> im fine with that
[1:46:03] <+Reizie_Etherealm> 10 level is a long damn time tho!!
[1:46:04] <mustyketchup> id rather have 1 good job quest than a million shit ones
[1:46:05] <%orihsnek> Better be a sick quest
[1:46:05] <cizal11> pat the drk quest is the best thing in the game
[1:46:05] <BunnyEmperor> Obviously its the one for the lvl 80 skill
[1:46:06] <bestwaifuritsu> RDM 70 quest sucked
[1:46:09] <%D33TR> i main WHM you should have seen our story
[1:46:09] <%MisterTylerrr> So we don't have our 80 job skill will be held back orr...
[1:46:11] <$valriot> Thats good, job quests got really annoying
[1:46:12] <%D33TR> god awful
[1:46:12] <+arbiduck> I want Estinien back for the DRG one!
[1:46:12] <%Agami23> that dumbass who healed people too good for healers
[1:46:13] <EL_TRO> both of DRK quest were rad
[1:46:13] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> DRK has really good job quests tho
[1:46:14] <2DSuperiority> or it only makes sense once the main story is over?
[1:46:14] <+8BitReaper> summoner job quest was great!
[1:46:14] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Dark Knight's was the best job quest line, so that's fine.
[1:46:14] <chaosbuckle> Job quests are my favorite part of the game. :(
[1:46:15] <%Aztec50> like a "you are become the grand daddy master" quest
[1:46:15] <haveswordmuststing> yeah, its just weird its a 10 level gap
[1:46:17] <%Toynota10> what's the level cap in this game?
[1:46:18] <Sydin18> But Curious George!!
[1:46:19] <+Arcana_Edgelord> DRK quests are the greatest
[1:46:26] <+Grayhammatter> OH?
[1:46:26] <chris_babaganoosh05> HIT ROCKS
[1:46:29] <lol0237> ooooh
[1:46:31] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> five SETS?

[1:46:39] <+Talkingburrito> let me hit tree better
[1:46:40] <TrainYukito> Every 2 levels, I think.
[1:46:41] <shizzlebizzfizz> FISHER CHADS RISE UP
[1:46:41] <AnActualHermitCrab> have they shown off any trailers or jobs , chat?
[1:46:42] <%Farples> Hit rocks better
[1:46:43] <EL_TRO> Hope 80 quest goes ham

[1:46:59] <TrainYukito> 72-74-76-78-80
[1:47:01] <Tucker0603> WHAT?
[1:47:02] <$birchpeninsula> makes sense
[1:47:04] <weeters> fishing, based
[1:47:05] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL making fishing relevant again
[1:47:07] <%Taisuru> Fishing cooking and potions
[1:47:08] <%Fidranth> Essence of Fishing
[1:47:08] <+TheImmortal70> Okay armorers and blacksmiths are combined
[1:47:09] <%nmaten> facet or nourisment
[1:47:14] <+TheImmortal70> They both are forgers
[1:47:16] <$valriot> FISHING QUESTS
[1:47:16] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The essence of NOURISHMENT
[1:47:22] <%Laecerelius> Facet of cooking shit!
[1:47:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fIsHiNg MiNiGaMeS
[1:47:29] <+cvp5127> will this be on the test?
[1:47:29] <+mr_dangus> her uhm's are killing me
[1:47:31] <KnightReis> metalworking, crafting (soft materials probably), then pots and food
[1:47:32] <%blastazoid26> Fishing doesnt give a fuck
[1:47:32] <+Talkingburrito> more fish to grind BibleThump BibleThump NotLikeThis
[1:47:35] <$valriot> CATCH THE LAKE GUARDIAN
[1:47:35] <TrainYukito> They could really implement more for fishing.

[1:48:03] <%CerberusDriver> is there a Meme class
[1:48:03] <Avoxis> Only the level 70 quests in SB had an action locked behind them anyways. Just making it one big quest instead is just the next logical step.

[2:18:37] <%chiluzza> BIG boo
[2:18:37] <+CanonHusbando> why are you even here just go read the leak
[2:18:37] <JoshTheFace> booooooo
[2:18:38] <BusterWoIf> booo, i lied chained
[2:18:40] <%danthelazy> booooo
[2:18:40] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Kekon3) (warning)
[2:18:41] <%Farples> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:18:41] <haveswordmuststing> fair, but MUH tank levels
[2:18:41] <$valriot> chain bonus was ass anyway
[2:18:42] <BusterWoIf> liked*
[2:18:43] <Angry_Ev1L> Nobody knows wtf chain bonus is anyway Kappa
[2:18:45] <+Lamsters> actual stream chat is full of people yelling about male viera
[2:18:47] <+HostilePoundcakes> rxtroREEE rxtroREEE rxtroREEE
[2:18:47] <+JEiddew> that's fine tbh
[2:18:48] <%Squibo> BAD
[2:18:50] <%gespenst25> Huh
[2:18:52] <$birchpeninsula> they said what we will see when embargo is lifted looks big numbers
[2:18:52] <Forester_Skippy> i think they wil increase exp to compensate and it is 100% now
[2:18:52] <%TrulyIncandescent> No more rushing dungeons for rapid xp
[2:18:53] <BunnyEmperor> Never really cared about this tbh
[2:18:54] <13sin> Ahh so now you can’t be pressured to rush for the chain exp.
[2:18:55] <%yeknomlive> chain bonus didn't matter anyways
[2:18:58] <+BioHunter> rip eureka
[2:18:58] <Basch71> thats fine
[2:18:59] <%Ahack13> eh, thats fine.
[2:18:59] <%orihsnek> Hm
[2:18:59] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> maybe that means there won't be some dungeons that were really good for EXP and some not
[2:19:00] <Kekon3> wow okay, no more chain bonus
[2:19:01] <nukle0nik> lots of cougihng
[2:19:04] <+Mekhet09> Good
[2:19:04] <+Cardz_> hmm
[2:19:08] <Basch71> chains was more of a XI thing
[2:19:09] <$birchpeninsula> chain was kinda relevanf
[2:19:09] <%yeknomlive> from dungeons
[2:19:10] <%CerberusDriver> WHeRes MaLe vEiRa
[2:19:10] <+talentedcrayon> If they raise overall exp that’s fine
[2:19:11] <cizal11> @yeknomlive it was a HUGE difference what are you talking about
[2:19:11] <silver__viii> This probably just means they adjusted exp gain to factor in a decent chain bonus so it doesn't fuck with dungeon runs and overexcited tanks/dps
[2:19:12] <+Mekhet09> Chain bonuses were annoing.
[2:19:13] <+HelloImTom08> eh whatever
[2:19:15] <MasterDecoder> @CanonHusbando Because official
[2:19:15] <Reireizei> it only worked if you were the item lvl of the dungeon you were entering I think
[2:19:15] <%Solshine11> FATE TRAIN NEVER DIES
[2:19:16] <+mik255> nonissue in dungeons
[2:19:19] <poodo89> come on positional murder
[2:19:19] <BusterWoIf> chains increase gain pretty well though, from 103+ to 300%+ someimtes
[2:19:20] <nukle0nik> yasashii
[2:19:22] <Angry_Ev1L> Causalising
[2:19:25] <+datmegamandeeeee> No more bad runs
[2:19:27] <transporterthesequel> I miss fate chain
[2:19:27] <%frsttcs> it's probably to stop tanks from fucking off from new players, dying and flaming
[2:19:32] <BunnyEmperor> That is probably it
[2:19:36] <%Shikari21> okay good we are getting mo
[2:19:37] <+talentedcrayon> 💯 % yep

[2:25:36] <transporterthesequel> Oh damn
[2:25:36] <+deemans> Wow's had this for years lmao
[2:25:37] <+SuicidalLemmming> should just overlap

[2:25:37] <EL_TRO> Darkest Niiiiiight
[2:25:40] <SkreamnR3dSkull> is FF14 gonna be more accessible after this update? I don't play MMO's

[2:26:05] <Valask> @SkreamnR3dSkull it's very accessible imo, the community is super friendly
[2:26:07] <%ArcanumMBD> that WAR still has his tank stance icon
[2:26:08] <Monkeyweed21> HEALER QOL
[2:26:09] <+burnley95> is FF14 worth playing on PS4?
[2:26:09] <$valriot> YOOOOO
[2:26:10] <cizal11> @SkreamnR3dSkull it was already accessible as hell
[2:26:10] <delicious_mystery> out of the way WHM shits its the SCH-AST master alliances time to shine!
[2:26:11] <+AndrewoidMk2> yeah wtf that guy is in defiance
[2:26:13] <haveswordmuststing> thats a bad UI choice, it should just overlay on top of the normal healthbar
[2:26:16] <transporterthesequel> If it’s not 100% you aren’t winnin
[2:26:17] <$valriot> Thats really useless
[2:26:17] <+Grayhammatter> that's awesome
[2:26:18] <KnightReis> is defiance now just a CD
[2:26:19] <+Venhammer> @SkreamnR3dSkull Its already one of the most accessible mmo's theres a whole chat and tutorial area for people who don't play mmos

[2:26:21] <Angry_Ev1L> of course BLM takes damage lol
[2:26:25] <+Varnarok> Couldn't tell that just by looking at the HP bar that is clearly missing a bit
[2:26:27] <Monkeyweed21> Healer is still misery
[2:26:28] <$valriot> Especially on "fill to max" mechanics
[2:26:30] <Forester_Skippy> its stance dancing for abilities
[2:26:30] <Phoenix_Cow> the bar isn't full that means they are not maxed health?
[2:26:34] <jackythefrost> @burnley95 I play it on PS4 yea its worth it
[2:26:34] <切捨御免> noooooo
[2:26:35] <DevinMayCry> They become traits instead of stances
[2:26:35] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's stacked on top of another hud element god damn it
[2:26:35] <SkreamnR3dSkull> :/
[2:26:35] <BusterWoIf> Overhealing!
[2:26:36] <cizal11> @AngriestPat i hope that's not true that's awful sounding

[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[3:01:03] <+TheImmortal70> They added so much to DRG
[3:01:05] <%Remery_> Never played this game before, every class looks cool
[3:01:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 this is gonna be background for me, sorry. And while dancer being like hunting horn sounds cool, pure support is just more appealing to me. Anyway, don't have too much free time today, so I'm gonna balance this stream with P5 and a movie. I'm thinking either back to the future 3, MIB 2, or one of the TMNT movies. I've burned myself out on favorite movies, so I'm going back a step to "almost favorite movies". Oh, and hey, is it safe to talk about pikachu on this stream?
[3:01:06] <+MaddyCaddy> So Bard got almost nothing?
[3:01:07] <+BioHunter> no drg pet though
[3:01:09] <+TheImmortal70> Changed how eyes work, and now we have more followups

[3:01:25] <ShutUpAceyP> jumps are faster so you don't die
[3:01:25] <+TheImmortal70> A third string ender
[3:01:28] <+Grayhammatter> BIG JUMPS
[3:01:29] <BunnyEmperor> They boosted jump speed because they got memed on for jumping into their deaths PogChamp
[3:01:32] <%Taisuru> Animation lock though?
[3:01:38] <haveswordmuststing> @kirby_sauce MIB is a better watch than both of those

[3:02:14] <StarMechV> FUCK DID I MISS IT?
[3:02:15] <haveswordmuststing> so does DRG have a stinger that can cross up
[3:02:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> @haveswordmuststing well, I have all 4 tmnt movies on a disk, so it's a wide choice
[3:02:19] <%clempstwitch> 85 raiders from clempstwitch have joined!

[3:03:09] <+doctor_piranha> I never saw the leaks

[3:03:39] <LilacsandFreedom> nice
[3:03:43] <%clempstwitch> This was all worth it for the sick job actions, we were all exploding in my chat
[3:03:43] <theobble> SAM time
[3:03:44] <BunnyEmperor> Oh wow I didnt even notice, you have little planets floating around you as AST
[3:03:44] <Mexrage> i was hoping to only go one job this expansion, this video made it that i want to run like 5 of them now Dx
[3:03:46] <theobble> yeyeyeye
[3:03:48] <%yeknomlive> did they do nin yet

[3:04:19] <theobble> Kreygasm
[3:04:20] <+Grayhammatter> judgement NUT
[3:04:21] <+TheImmortal70> That cross strike setup double midare
[3:04:25] <%apostateCourier> Here's the actual most important DRG change: Blood of the Dragon gives you 30 seconds instead of 20, and popping Life of the Dragon gives you 30 NO MATTER HOW MUCH BAR YOU HAVE
[3:04:25] <+TheImmortal70> And then one big ender
[3:04:27] <+DoctorDerp388> damn
[3:04:27] <+mik255> WE LEGEND OF DRAGOON NOW
[3:04:27] <%Venhammer> this game is becoming a jojo/dmc crossover
[3:04:32] <+Greerhead> new gurren too
[3:04:32] <+DoctorDerp388> CHOPPIN TIME
[3:04:34] <%Dr00_PhD> lytMOTIVATED
[3:04:35] <BunnyEmperor> They gave BLM 2 Fouls, and SAM 2 Midare Setsugekka
[3:04:39] <+TheImmortal70> Immediate cone AoE
[3:04:40] <+DoctorDerp388> war mains unite
[3:04:42] <Finaldragoon> @mik255 damn right
[3:04:43] <%PROUD2beGINGER> CLEAVE THAT BOI
[3:04:44] <%Remery_> Choppa Choppa
[3:04:49] <+HelloImTom08> WAR looked kinda underwhelping compared to the other tanks
[3:04:51] <+TheImmortal70> There's unleash
[3:04:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> M O T l V A T E D
[3:04:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> KILL AND BREAK
[3:04:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIIIIIIIIIIIP
[3:04:53] <Self_esteampunk> dark knight gets a stando!
[3:04:53] <切捨御免> Deliverance PepeHands
[3:04:53] <televisedrevolting> So would now be a good time to get into FF14 cause this shit looks FUCKING COOL
[3:04:54] <StarMechV> Did Red Mage got any changes?
[3:04:55] <+TheImmortal70> Another AoE
[3:04:55] <JoshTheFace> ?
[3:04:56] <ShutUpAceyP> only tank stance?
[3:04:57] <%Taisuru> Offensive stance gone!
[3:04:59] <%Niney_Who> STANCE GONE
[3:05:01] <%clempstwitch> See ya'll later, I'm off to bed! <3 Will watch it there too eyy
[3:05:02] <Forester_Skippy> this song is so fuckign good
[3:05:05] <%SergeEXE> only offense?
[3:05:06] <+doctor_piranha> Oooof no dps stance? :/
[3:05:06] <+miguelrod777> WHY OFFENSUVE
[3:05:07] <RoboXGP> what is this home shopping shit playing in the background
[3:05:08] <+Nomicro4u> Bye feet man
[3:05:08] <%juxtest> Some kind of buff
[3:05:10] <Saterion> Bye Clemps
[3:05:12] <Thalchampz> later clemps! good rest!
[3:05:12] <%lemuhollow> Have they talked about the "single player" content?
[3:05:13] <+RocketBarrel> Bye clemps
[3:05:15] <+AndrewoidMk2> rip in peace deliverance, even though we get your actions your 5% damage buff and crit rate buff will be missed ;_;7
[3:05:15] <%joylent_blue> later clemps <3
[3:05:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> inner beast is gone
[3:05:17] <Dastardry> Only 4 FC's, lame
[3:05:17] <+Shockrates20XX> Why are they being coy? "Oh it looked like they did some kind of thing. Huh."
[3:05:19] <+mik255> makes sense
[3:05:20] <+MisterCrimson> but the gauge is permanent
[3:05:20] <DrGasMax> Oh boy I love fighting for aggro
[3:05:21] <Louie_Salmon> So no more stances, functionally?
[3:05:22] <+MightyMarlowe> Deliverance is the base now i guess
[3:05:25] <Edible_Enthusiasm> so this is another case of "cleric stance"
[3:05:26] <%VicWright> Aggro stance basically
[3:05:26] <+TheImmortal70> Ver aero and scatter
[3:05:27] <StarMechV> YEEEEAH
[3:05:27] <$valriot> This Omega remix thoughhh
[3:05:27] <mojokingizakku> are they effectively offensive stance all the time now?
[3:05:28] <$jobbedbone> @clempstwitch nigh nigh glove pervert
[3:05:29] <+TheImmortal70> A NEW LIGHTNING
[3:05:29] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> offensive stance is just tank stance is off like how DRK works
[3:05:30] <RoboXGP> oh it's a video, i thought he was playing
[3:05:30] <%Taisuru> It's the same thing in the end, only one stance
[3:05:31] <StarMechV> WHERE ARE MY RED BOIS AT
[3:05:32] <BunnyEmperor> It seems so, they apparently merged both stance effects into one. HP boost of defiance and attack power and skills of deliverance
[3:05:34] <raimsurion> There will be only one stance, and only positives
[3:05:37] <$valriot> Omega coming back?? PogChamp PogChamp
[3:05:37] <RinWR> eScape remix in the background
[3:05:41] <+TheImmortal70> Jolt 2 and ver aero
[3:05:42] <+TheImmortal70> A stab in

[3:06:57] <+Grayhammatter> the most greasiest
[3:06:57] <Tomschiii> @cizal11 still, a little more flashy would be cool
[3:06:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@cizal11)
[3:07:01] <+TheImmortal70> @PharosOfLight Now that TP is gone, he probably ramps up in damage and doesn't stop
[3:07:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I'm very happy with PLD

[3:18:27] <+Ell1ot> dancers in real life give me big buffs
[3:18:28] <BunnyEmperor> I mean thats what Dancer literally is in the FF series, so they didnt go out of their way to keep that up, considering Bard is a buffer too
[3:18:28] <DSD24> @Louie_Salmon I gotta check this out cause I only saw that one clip of the horrible audio issues
[3:18:29] <theworstgamer77> DNC is the new FF11 GEO...
[3:18:30] <%crowsloft77> the ast of dps
[3:18:32] <+AccioSkullar> does this mean bard nerfs
[3:18:33] <%SolidusRex> I like big buffs and I cannot lie
[3:18:34] <+thesw1tch> this is still on? i left to eat. did they fix all the issues of the stream yet?
[3:18:35] <zepelinnn> X DOUBT
[3:18:35] <TioXyco> shake that ass! it motivates the party
[3:18:36] <haveswordmuststing> Buff Dancers Kreygasm

[3:18:45] <Fujiwara_92> X TO DOUBT
[3:18:45] <Angry_Ev1L> delete dancer
[3:18:46] <sjcodan> ITS EITHER GONNA BE SHiT, OR NECESSARY
[3:18:46] <$jobbedbone> BEAR FORCE ONE
[3:18:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Theyr saying that DANCER is NECESSARY
[3:18:48] <%OdysseyKnight> You are saying that but will players agree
[3:18:50] <%KnightReis> hrothgar buff dancers
[3:18:52] <cowardlord> What do bards do then
[3:18:53] <%Laecerelius> Dancer is less about dealing damage itself and more about helping everyone else do damage, I'd imagine
[3:18:53] <Broand> making my dancer a roegadyn so she can be a BIG BUFF DANCER
[3:18:55] <%Agami23> get a backup dancer
[3:18:57] <+skyheys> @Reireizei Butt stack, you say?
[3:19:02] <Louie_Salmon> @dsd24 It was genuinely entertaining, at least with Pat here

[3:19:48] <+MightyMarlowe> BATMAN HELMET
[3:19:50] <cizal11> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
[3:19:50] <$jobbedbone> NANI
[3:19:50] <+Grayhammatter> yes!
[3:19:51] <%crowsloft77> thats a very Berserk looking sword
[3:19:53] <%cTAKU> Let's GO!
[3:19:59] <%yeknomlive> hmmmm
[3:20:05] <pectusumbra> pat you're hunching and rubbing your goblin hands together
[3:20:06] <+DoctorDerp388> yep
[3:20:09] <+DoctorDerp388> that's what i thought
[3:20:09] <%SergeEXE> Whoo!
[3:20:10] <Morsuzado> fucking finally
[3:20:11] <%Rawklobstah88> OF course
[3:20:11] <CaptainFrankincense> GOOD
[3:20:12] <%Sulliman34> wait gunsword is a TANK job???
[3:20:13] <cizal11> obviously
[3:20:14] <$Valdorick> Main Tank will be Dark Knight's shadow, off tank will be summoning Dark Knight Kappa
[3:20:14] <+TheImmortal70> Well they have to be because single tank instances
[3:20:14] <+WhereIsWill> CONFIRMED
[3:20:15] <BunnyEmperor> So they buffed PLDs pulling
[3:20:15] <$jobbedbone> semi tank and uke tank
[3:20:17] <garbageheaphound> WAIT GUNBREAKER'S A TANK
[3:20:17] <Angry_Ev1L> they fucking won't
[3:20:17] <%hawk_rush> that's awesome
[3:20:18] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Monkeyweed21)
[3:20:18] <JoshTheFace> GOOD
[3:20:19] <vierleger> pat don't touch your nose
[3:20:20] <%yeknomlive> oh different role actions on off tak?
[3:20:22] <TioXyco> yes, they will
[3:20:23] <%VicWright> The tank stance will probably just be a switch to turn on aggro gain
[3:20:26] <Tucker0603> Yes pat I can main tank as a pally
[3:20:26] <darkliff2> i dont believe
[3:20:32] <%Agami23> what is MT and OT pat? @AngriestPat
[3:20:32] <+StrawberryPantsu> WAR is just DPS though
[3:20:32] <+TheImmortal70> DRK is hands down a MT now
[3:20:34] <cant_pick_a_name> !uptime
[3:20:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 20m.
[3:20:34] <theobble> But midgardsormr decides who is MT 🤔
[3:20:37] <+StrawberryPantsu> A blue DPS
[3:20:37] <AmericanaRed> ThunBeast ThunBeast ThunBeast ThunBeast ThunBeast ThunBeast
[3:20:45] <+lewdmuffin> they finally have a translator?
[3:20:45] <+Grayhammatter> drk is definitely a MT
[3:20:48] <Thalchampz> @Agami23 Main Tank and Off Tank
[3:20:48] <+TheImmortal70> Because they need to be getting hit to generate blood optimally
[3:20:49] <%KnightReis> war is just blue dps with the most disgusting aggro generation in the game
[3:20:50] <%Kirby_Sauce> WHOS TALKING
[3:20:55] <+TheImmortal70> And that leads to living shadow
[3:20:59] <Louie_Salmon> Oh, so tank stance makes you MT, having it off makes you OT?
[3:21:00] <GateCreeper_> yeah but people will still act like like MT is still reserved for certain jobs
[3:21:04] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Kirby's talking
[3:21:05] <%Agami23> @Thalchampz but what's that mean?
[3:21:09] <Angry_Ev1L> they are weak
[3:21:10] <%stoicman90> pat has passed Day9
[3:21:13] <+bear_breaker20> @VicWright that would kinda suck
[3:21:18] <AllenDeadman> oh was gun breaker announced?
[3:21:20] <WolfHavocX> jaboodyLurk
[3:21:20] <Tucker0603> RAD
[3:21:20] <%KnightReis> weakness, double PLD is the cutting edge
[3:21:21] <OtakuBrawler> this is still going on?
[3:21:22] <BunnyEmperor> WAR gets the HP buff 100%
[3:21:24] <Angry_Ev1L> literally never gave a fuck about tank compositions
[3:21:25] <$Valdorick> Day9? That's a name I haven't heard in a very long time...
[3:21:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> @PROUD2beGINGER there ya go
[3:21:35] <%cTAKU> MercyWing1 apatWink MercyWing2 BUFF
[3:21:36] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit, that's awesome
[3:21:36] <MarylandJutsu> CHOICES
[3:21:38] <chris_babaganoosh05> ARE STANCES GO THO
[3:21:43] <DrGasMax> So they are making Tanks Tops and Bottoms?
[3:21:47] <%SergeEXE> @chris_babaganoosh05 Only Offense Stance
[3:21:49] <zecht89> homogenized?
[3:21:49] <%KnightReis> you get an intervention/blackest night

[3:23:25] <%KnightReis> tank stance off is basically offensive stance
[3:23:26] <%SergeEXE> STAnCE GIVES DIFFERENT ABILITIES!?
[3:23:29] <Tucker0603> THANK GOD!!
[3:23:30] <%Sulliman34> i really hope monk will be better in ShB
[3:23:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> No penalty, ok cool
[3:23:30] <haveswordmuststing> .....
[3:23:32] <%blastazoid26> it only affects enmity then
[3:23:32] <切捨御免> YEYEYEYEY
[3:23:34] <ShutUpAceyP> so what's the point of tank stance then?
[3:23:38] <+TheImmortal70> Only affects enmity
[3:23:39] <%Rawklobstah88> THANK. GOD.
[3:23:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> Enmity gen

[3:23:42] <Keiji_Maede24> THANK GOD!!
[3:23:46] <Forester_Skippy> ok mt has no reaso nto turn that off unless ther eis a tank swap then
[3:23:46] <%GarbageNirvana> @ShutUpAceyP Not drawing all the aggro if you're OT I suppose
[3:23:46] <%SergeEXE> Ahhhhhhh
[3:23:47] <GrandmasterBFunk> that's really what they had to do to fix people never using if
[3:23:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> YES let me just turn my tank stance on and just leave it on while I do my thing
[3:23:49] <%SergeEXE> THANK GOD
[3:23:50] <SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE
[3:23:51] <haveswordmuststing> i kinda liked the extra defense...
[3:23:51] <%averageliftsdonequick> emnity and I assume some abilitiesm require tank stance
[3:23:51] <ShutUpAceyP> oh nice!
[3:23:51] <Louie_Salmon> So tank stance will literally just draw aggro?
[3:23:51] <%OdysseyKnight> Nice
[3:23:54] <Daniel_Is_I> So it's just more threat
[3:23:54] <poodo89> YOOOOO
[3:23:55] <ShutUpAceyP> that's really good
[3:23:55] <Z1PH3R> Good
[3:23:56] <Tucker0603> YES MAH PLD BoiS!
[3:23:56] <$valriot> FUCK THATS GOOD
[3:23:57] <indig0bird> Ohhhh that's cool
[3:24:00] <+SirBearic> YES!
[3:24:00] <+WhereIsWill> ITS GROWING
[3:24:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Yup
[3:24:02] <+MisterCrimson> fuck yeah
[3:24:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> MAIN TANK SWITCH
[3:24:07] <+AndrewoidMk2> i am so excited for shadowbringers
[3:24:07] <%yeknomlive> ok
[3:24:07] <+Grayhammatter> ITS GROWING!
[3:24:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> Can't wait for all tanks to sit in aggro anyway
[3:24:09] <+TheImmortal70> Tank swapping with pugs has never been easier
[3:24:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> SO ur MT and OT. based on. am i fucking aggroing or not
[3:24:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> GENIUS
[3:24:16] <$valriot> ALL ATTACKS
[3:24:18] <$Valdorick> So I can spam Fire 2 to my hearts content!? (I haven't played since 2.0, oh god, is Fire 2 even a thing anymore!?)
[3:24:19] <DSD24> You attract more hate
[3:24:19] <+mik255> all attacks increase emnity
[3:24:19] <poodo89> PULL MY TANK TRIGGER
[3:24:20] <%Kirijuo> That's why ninja lost its enmity skills
[3:24:22] <%OdysseyKnight> I might tank now with this
[3:24:22] <$valriot> AGGRO COMBO DEAD
[3:24:25] <+KSabot> i'm proper chuffed
[3:24:25] <Angry_Ev1L> literally casul trash lol
[3:24:27] <+DoctorDerp388> so just always have it on or what
[3:24:32] <BunnyEmperor> So basically, turn stance on as MT without a downside. Turn it off if you have to tank swap and let the other tank use it. That is insanely good.
[3:24:36] <%OdysseyKnight> Maintaining enmity will be easier overall it looks like
[3:24:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> IMPLEMENTED
[3:24:41] <Tucker0603> trait?
[3:24:44] <+DoctorDerp388> WHAT

[3:25:12] <%yeknomlive> tanks are just dps then
[3:25:12] <+MisterRockett> UGHWAAAAAH!?
[3:25:12] <+KSabot> eh
[3:25:13] <BunnyEmperor> TANK REWORK IS UNPARALLELED
[3:25:13] <+Sinetha> YES YES YES
[3:25:13] <Tucker0603> But power slash looked rad
[3:25:14] <%Sulliman34> THIS IS THE STANCE
[3:25:14] <+AndrewoidMk2> everything is as it should be
[3:25:15] <DSD24> But combos sound nice
[3:25:16] <a_c_chirns> OIL UP
[3:25:16] <StarMechV> PLD just became EVEN EASIER
[3:25:16] <SkreamnR3dSkull> I'm just enjoying Pat's hype :D
[3:25:17] <%Sulliman34> MANA COMBO ALL DAY
[3:25:17] <AmericanaRed> OWL2019DVa OWL2019DVa OWL2019DVa OWL2019gg
[3:25:18] <%Shadowthedigger> This makes my tank go down.
[3:25:19] <sjcodan> NANI
[3:25:20] <%cTAKU> Huh? DPS all day, well alright then
[3:25:21] <jackythefrost> BAKANA!!!
[3:25:21] <$Valdorick> Tanks just Spank now Kappa
[3:25:27] <%Thetulev> time to learn how to tank
[3:25:29] <%KnightReis> looks like you need to fight for aggro now instead of just doing it once
[3:25:30] <+michingmallecho> EleGiggle EleGiggle
[3:25:30] <+DoctorDerp388> well alrighty then
[3:25:30] <%gespenst25> Rage of Halone BibleThump
[3:25:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> But will there be another combo replacing it? Or are they just removing the effect from the combo and have it only do damage?
[3:25:31] <%nyurgh> why would you not play tank now
[3:25:32] <%SergeEXE> happy
[3:25:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pats NUT face
[3:25:33] <Morsuzado> Dork knight forever!
[3:25:34] <theobble> SAME ROTATION
[3:25:34] <%SergeEXE> HAPPYY
[3:25:36] <poodo89> DRK best tank confirmed
[3:25:37] <chris_babaganoosh05> Pat do you need some Kleenex
[3:25:39] <+SirBearic> basically if your main tanking your stance is on! if you arent its off, no more BS stance juggling
[3:25:40] <+witupo> oh weird I'm a tank now
[3:25:43] <Tucker0603> RIP Rage of halone
[3:25:44] <haveswordmuststing> so do the enmity combos to buffs instead
[3:25:44] <Applecannon63> Tanks now can use Spankers
[3:25:45] <%Owkono> I clapped
[3:25:45] <+mik255> WERE ALL ROADHOG NOW
[3:25:45] <AmericanaRed> Congratulations
[3:25:45] <%Tallie> DRK and MCH redeption arc
[3:25:46] <+CanonHusbando> looks like they're moving away from WOW style raid structure
[3:25:46] <bestwaifuritsu> You now have no fucking reason to not level a tank now LUL
[3:25:48] <+BioHunter> hate that drk helmet
[3:25:49] <televisedrevolting> So since no one answered me earlier, would June 2 be a good time to get into FF14? Cause all this stuff looks cool as hell
[3:25:49] <redeight8> tanks are now baby proof
[3:25:51] <haitakaa> Blood Pressure increasing exponentionally
[3:25:51] <aqua_mashu> WE ARE FREEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:25:53] <xeros720> this is better since they'll learn the proper rotations while leveling
[3:25:53] <Daniel_Is_I> So you're just gonna turn stances on and off to switch who's tanking
[3:25:53] <%QuadraticGravity> Where did this SHIELD I'mn holding come from
[3:25:53] <+Plaxer> this is nice
[3:25:54] <Z1PH3R> Just wait for people to figure aout some stupid meta
[3:25:59] <BunnyEmperor> Finally playing tank is fun again with all the ignorant DPS spergs
[3:26:02] <+Grayhammatter> mmmmm, i can't wait
[3:26:02] <theobble> lvl 1 LUL
[3:26:03] <Fujiwara_92> 4 TANKS ONLY
[3:26:05] <Tomschiii> i am a tank but i dont understand sh*t^^
[3:26:07] <PlantaTrepadora> it would be a nice time to get everything cheaper, thats for sure
[3:26:10] <haveswordmuststing> like, the ENTIRE POINT of the tank class is being stripped away
[3:26:11] <%clempstwitch> Yoshi P is a GOD
[3:26:11] <transporterthesequel> oh so i get to be a dps and never die got it
[3:26:23] <indig0bird> This will make using DRK for MQ so much easier
[3:26:24] <%Sulliman34> so theyre streamlining tanks
[3:26:25] <%Sulliman34> i like that
[3:26:26] <vierleger> Imagine the shitstorm if tank classes are better at doing DPS than DPS classes now
[3:26:26] <+eastsportman> TANK MASTA!!!
[3:26:27] <haveswordmuststing> more damage is cool but i like living
[3:26:31] <%QuadraticGravity> @televisedrevolting Might as well try the free trial now, and then decide if you want to buy into Complete after SHB launch
[3:26:31] <%Kirby_Sauce> Ok, so I think I understand what happened with the sub. I linked my accounts AFTER I subbed, so I'm guessing it doesn't proq till my sub runs out in 8 days.
[3:26:33] <%crowsloft77> not sure how to feel about this
[3:26:34] <DevinMayCry> Clemps if you use the DRK level 80 do you summon Dark Clemps?
[3:26:37] <+Grayhammatter> whoa, that's cool
[3:26:38] <+Radalorian> @televisedrevolting get in now, heavenward (the 2nd expansion) is free
[3:26:38] <%SergeEXE> @haveswordmuststing trait
[3:26:38] <xeros720> i see, this ties into the strength change it mentioned earlier
[3:26:40] <Thalchampz> clemps stayed awake because of sheer hyper
[3:26:44] <BunnyEmperor> So only boosts? No nerfs? JUST BOOSTED AF
[3:26:45] <+Akabane101> No longer will tanks wipe parties by leaving tank stance off and then blame it on healers. Kreygasm
[3:26:45] <+DoctorDerp388> tanks still definitely have a point, but the playstyle i just dps now i guess
[3:26:47] <%averyoddjew> do i get back into this game....
[3:26:48] <%ElenaManetta> arf arf arf arf
[3:26:48] <Tucker0603> TANK Bois RISE UP!
[3:26:49] <ShutUpAceyP> Dark Pat!
[3:26:50] <EL_TRO> patch this shit in now
[3:26:52] <drpeepeeshmebe> i dont like any of these changes lol
[3:26:55] <xeros720> y'know, with the relaxing of tank gearing
[3:26:55] <haveswordmuststing> OK, got it
[3:26:58] <BlissieB> @televisedrevolting I would say anytime is great to jump in, there will be deals going on so I’d say that’s a good time
[3:26:58] <+CanonHusbando> tanks will still draw agro they just don't have to only draw agro
[3:27:01] <ShutUpAceyP> Dark Pat is back!
[3:27:03] <%Verd_254> i only have sound so ill just assume that's the sound of pat fapping
[3:27:05] <+leonaflur> i will be the strongest PLD now
[3:27:05] <%OdysseyKnight> They really want more tank players
[3:27:07] <indig0bird> I'll use the Odenta as glam c:
[3:27:11] <%SergeEXE> I have to level a DRK now
[3:27:11] <%danthelazy> TANKS RISE UP
[3:27:11] <MarylandJutsu> EVIL DARK PAT
[3:27:16] <+DoctorDerp388> yeah you'll get a ton more tanks in df now
[3:27:17] <+Grayhammatter> tanks rise UP!
[3:27:18] <TioXyco> I'm not sure if pat is happy, unhappy or pants jizzed
[3:27:25] <delicious_mystery> BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR BLU TANKING? said somebody, probably
[3:27:26] <televisedrevolting> @quadraticgravity Cool is it on console because I am a poor boy who lacks cash money and a working gaming PC
[3:27:26] <%Stonebeard> Now can we get tank stance at level 15
[3:27:26] <%yeknomlive> kind of takes the fun out of why u liked warriors
[3:27:27] <redeight8> you can now afk as tank yay
[3:27:28] <chaosbuckle> TANKS up rise!
[3:27:29] <weeters> tanks seem cool as fuck now
[3:27:30] <Fujiwara_92> IMAGINE BEING A DPS AND NOT TANKING... this post is made by tank gang
[3:27:31] <+Rinkimah> IDK if anyone has mentioned it but heavensward is free for those who own the base game via mog station
[3:27:32] <Louie_Salmon> @verd_254 Yep, he's jerking it to how good tanks are now
[3:27:43] <sjcodan> Jack missed rage of halone
[3:27:45] <%QuadraticGravity> @televisedrevolting It is in fact on PS4 if you want to play on console, and it has crossplay with PC players.
[3:27:45] <%Kirijuo> My theory is Grit is gone and Darkside is the Tank Stance now
[3:27:46] <azacca_bitter> pat need kleenex for eyes and bepis
[3:27:46] <Morsuzado> now I can maintain my mp as a drk without the damn red mage pulling aggro.
[3:27:47] <vierleger> more like Dank Role Jobs
[3:27:47] <%cTAKU> Careful Pat not to get Wanker's cramp
[3:27:48] <chaosbuckle> Looking forward to going back to my DRK now. :D
[3:27:49] <ShutUpAceyP> magic tank!
[3:27:57] <+Qsmash_> All tank party let's do it
[3:27:58] <%EvilSoully> @AngriestPat what you think that tank you mentioned on twitter thinks about these changes?
[3:27:59] <bestwaifuritsu> fucking drk main now
[3:28:03] <indig0bird> This should make it easier for fucking cowards to join the ranks of tanks!
[3:28:05] <$Ravemouse> So tanks just have one combo to spam since they removed debuffs and enmity making it a stance thing
[3:28:06] <%OdysseyKnight> and dropping those defense cooldowns as needed
[3:28:08] <TigerClaws12> just do damage 4Head
[3:28:10] <Derkinstacker> YES
[3:28:10] <Tucker0603> Imma miss sword oath
[3:28:10] <cizal11> so no tanks have no excuse not to do dps
[3:28:11] <+DoctorDerp388> burly dps now
[3:28:12] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> clap clap clap, Pat.
[3:28:13] <BunnyEmperor> Imagine no longer having to bother with DPS who dont watch their aggro since you will guaranteed to keep aggro as MT now no matter what... oh my they did it... they fucking did it
[3:28:13] <$Ravemouse> Kinda feels gimped
[3:28:14] <poodo89> gotta get drk to 70 now
[3:28:14] <+Grayhammatter> YES
[3:28:16] <Crushter> people who think tanking is easier despite us getting 7 role jobs based around disabling enemies and protecting teammates might be unable to read
[3:28:18] <+leonaflur> yea!
[3:28:19] <+SirBearic> no more stances! no more dark arts!! this is the best day ever
[3:28:20] <%Venhammer> People complaining about this, tanks already dps as hard as they can, they’re just streamlining it
[3:28:20] <nanaki_ff14> Just finsihed getting DRK to 70 so hyped
[3:28:25] <%KnightReis> how do i spam halone without halon
[3:28:27] <theobble> darkside animation sucked anyways
[3:28:30] <+eastsportman> YES! YES! YES!
[3:28:32] <redeight8> gun breakers will never know the struggle!
[3:28:35] <%QuadraticGravity> But RAGE OF HALONE though
[3:28:36] <Tucker0603> NOOOOOOOO!!
[3:28:37] <+leonaflur> my PLD gets a gap closer im happy
[3:28:42] <Morsuzado> bye sword oats
[3:28:44] <MarylandJutsu> no more DPS STANCES
[3:28:44] <%crowsloft77> Oh shit that drk clone is gonna be fun with this
[3:28:44] <Tucker0603> My Sword OAth T^T
[3:28:46] <+Comrade_Vladof> Man, WAR is looking really lame compared to the other tanks
[3:28:47] <%SergeEXE> by oats
[3:28:50] <theobble> 🦀 SWORD OATH IS GONE 🦀
[3:28:50] <Basch71> sword oath was dumb
[3:28:51] <+Grayhammatter> F sword oath
[3:28:52] <%PharosOfLight> but...but.. I took an oath!
[3:28:52] <%KnightReis> oh no zeplas video is useless now
[3:28:53] <Forester_Skippy> but meter build?
[3:28:53] <sjcodan> Am I fucking crazy, or did they just make tanks braindead?

[3:38:49] <%torusendor> I had a healer today
[3:38:49] <azacca_bitter> healers dont protecc
[3:38:50] <Madbearv> nobody cares about dps
[3:38:51] <MittinsKittens> Finally, I can not forget to use Protect when I start content.
[3:38:51] <+Baron_VonCookies> no protecc?
[3:38:51] <ChoculaUltra> "but it is gone now"
[3:38:54] <Z1PH3R> "Protecc will be added"

[3:38:55] <bestwaifuritsu> If you fucks wouldnt keep running away when im trying to cast it at the start of a run you deserve it to be gone
[3:38:57] <Atzumo_Kayami> Going through the MSQ with a healer is going to be shit now
[3:38:58] <haitakaa> did he just say Oppai??
[3:39:00] <$valriot> Content just never really MADE healers heal @angriestpat
[3:39:02] <+JEiddew> Healers no longer DPSing is a massive fucking loss.
[3:39:02] <+MisterCrimson> F to pay Protects
[3:39:02] <+doctor_piranha> They had better make healing REAL interesting then
[3:39:02] <%gespenst25> But I don't want to not DPS what's the point?
[3:39:03] <%KnightReis> i only want to tank so flash is my best friend
[3:39:08] <+KSabot> Give SCH a HoT
[3:39:09] <redeight8> no attack, no pre dungeon prep. my life got a lot easier
[3:39:11] <Dastardry> Healing is going to be really boring if all you're going to do is just stand around and wait for literally anyone to take damage
[3:39:14] <CaptainFrankincense> "man I am bad pless take away my dps" - the average healer
[3:39:14] <%NeonTurnip> pat looks displeased
[3:39:16] <%QuadraticGravity> Healers not damaging as much could feel so bad
[3:39:20] <MarylandJutsu> Revive is NEXT
[3:39:21] <+sixklove> hey eduardo
[3:39:23] <ShutUpAceyP> how will healers beat missions requiring DPS?
[3:39:23] <+DoctorDerp388> PogChamp i don't have to pay healers' subs anymore
[3:39:26] <%PharosOfLight> @KSabot dosen't fairy have a Hot?
[3:39:26] <vierleger> Healer DPS is fun, but I hate being expected to DPS at all times. Sometimes I just don't know a fight, or the tank is bad.
[3:39:28] <zepelinnn> imagine being so bad that you cant dps between heals
[3:39:29] <CurrySauseBandit> @Dastardry Healbots incoming
[3:39:33] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[3:39:34] <haveswordmuststing> good luck leveling up healers Kappa
[3:39:36] <AnActualHermitCrab> @Dastardry a healer's primary role is healing, idk what to tell you LUL
[3:39:37] <$valriot> WHAT
[3:39:37] <%torusendor> I've had so many healers who just REFUSE to use protect
[3:39:45] <Angry_Ev1L> ? wrong
[3:39:47] <+skyheys> Pat that doesn't even make sense.
[3:39:48] <$valriot> INSTANT HEALS?????
[3:39:48] <haveswordmuststing> Solo's gonna be real fun
[3:39:49] <BunnyEmperor> That depends widely on the content youre doing and is not entirely true
[3:39:49] <silver__viii> Tanks do more DPS now to balance out the lack of Healer DPS, I don't see how this is worse than "everything should be dps at all times forget the rest of your kit" I'm interested to see what they do
[3:39:51] <transporterthesequel> No he's right tho
[3:39:51] <%meraud> NotLikeThis
[3:39:54] <$Kaialb> what?
[3:39:54] <sjcodan> CRAZY TALK
[3:39:54] <cizal11> @AngriestPat neither of those is true if BOTH use their cooldowns correctly
[3:39:55] <vierleger> @torusendor I am sorry, sometimes I forget
[3:39:56] <+yasukanzuki> wut?
[3:39:56] <%Dkun4> That's the wrongest you've ever been Pat
[3:39:57] <Saisher> pat you're not making any senze
[3:39:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> He's totally right
[3:39:58] <+JEiddew> fuck, but dpsing as a healer was a great way to show your mastery of the game though. It's for good players.
[3:39:58] <vierleger> gomenasai
[3:39:59] <JoshTheFace> whoa
[3:39:59] <%BaeD_JD> i hated the do damage healer meta
[3:40:01] <%BlancoRico> DPS tanks makes my job alot harder
[3:40:01] <Ziginski> ??
[3:40:01] <+yasukanzuki> ogcd heals?
[3:40:02] <%Mateus84723> Yeah that's not fun though
[3:40:02] <DeadSquid> umm uhhh
[3:40:03] <Basch71> he's right actually
[3:40:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> So then what will healers do when there is LITERALLY no damage incoming?
[3:40:05] <%Takreth> Oh boi I can't wait to be AFK for most content because I can't do damage
[3:40:05] <redeight8> white mage getting lustrate
[3:40:06] <Z1PH3R> Panic Heal!
[3:40:07] <poodo89> pat's super right
[3:40:07] <Forester_Skippy> the thing is even in savage that didnt matter with how many of global heals hit so hard to heal
[3:40:07] <zepelinnn> what are CDs LUL
[3:40:08] <+lewdmuffin> should dub this the pat expansion
[3:40:09] <13sin> Can you explain that in more detail Pat?
[3:40:10] <+Grayhammatter> ogcd heals though!
[3:40:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Tanks should be tanking healers should be healing and buffing
[3:40:12] <SaltyGuyMan> this stream has convinced me to download the game for the first time in years
[3:40:12] <+ClaireBearz> doing anything that isn't top tier raid content as a healer is going to be really dull without dpsing being mixed in like before
[3:40:14] <Angry_Ev1L> He's not fucking right if Idon;t see dat 3k dps from healers lmao they're going out
[3:40:15] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If tanks do more damage, they will take more damage and thus need more healing
[3:40:15] <$valriot> YEEEEE INSTANT HEALS scarfFang scarfFang scarfFang scarfFang
[3:40:15] <Dastardry> @AnActualHermitCrab Best part of healing in WoW was blasting undead enemies in Mt. Hyjal as a paladin in tbc
[3:40:16] <Skaw_Lann> my chat dudes, thats just logic
[3:40:16] <%KnightReis> it would work if bosses didn't hit like a wet noodle so healers don't do nothing most of the time if not attacking
[3:40:16] <%weissguard> So Pure Healing is good so that there isn't a split between duties? @AngriestPat
[3:40:20] <transporterthesequel> More DPS means less time in tank stance which means you took more damage
[3:40:20] <Monkeyweed21> As long as they live you can still DPS
[3:40:20] <%yeknomlive> @kingdom_65 accessible is fine but they're lowering skill ceiling
[3:40:23] <$Tuskor13> @AnActualHermitCrab but if "a pure healing role" means they get literally no damage abilities that would be not fun to play, like at least have minor damage that debuffs or something
[3:40:23] <Atzumo_Kayami> What the fuck am I going to do in a raid when no one needs healing
[3:40:25] <%Taisuru> Can I tab target allies yet?
[3:40:26] <deadhorsepersonified> that's not entirely true, tank skill level played a role in how much healing we have to do
[3:40:27] <BunnyEmperor> Healer and Tank dps are equally as necessary and fun in any content to have, reducing that is dumb and not a good choice
[3:40:28] <KatabolicRage> they'le clearly have SOME attacks
[3:40:29] <indig0bird> And do damage
[3:40:30] <%juxtest> The most important question is, what is the status of Book of the New Sun references in the new expansion?
[3:40:31] <redeight8> change podcats
[3:40:31] <%averageliftsdonequick> >implying healers can't do some damage to do story quests
[3:40:31] <%PharosOfLight> They still have attacks, we saw them
[3:40:32] <Cerabret100> but WM already have instant heals? Tetra, the shield, the full heal stuff. guess they just mean spammable?
[3:40:32] <KatabolicRage> they need to for solo content
[3:40:33] <Madbearv> I've died so many times because the healer decided to dps
[3:40:33] <%BaeD_JD> i like doing pure healing
[3:40:36] <%averageliftsdonequick> >being this dumb
[3:40:39] <+JEiddew> RIP heavensward cleric stance, made the healing game really unique
[3:40:39] <+SuicidalLemmming> im sure theyll have moves that do damage
[3:40:40] <%VioletHeart> Buff the party and do some damae.
[3:40:40] <%BlancoRico> astro just keeps rollign cards like a jackass in teh corner
[3:40:41] <arknodem> We do damage Pat.
[3:40:41] <Ravoric> Healers are still gonna do damage anyways
[3:40:43] <Fujiwara_92> what not LUL
[3:40:44] <TraceBullet> black mage butt
[3:40:45] <%GarbageNirvana> So they want casters to have more mobility
[3:40:45] <+TheImmortal70> They better, because either healing is gonna become hellish, or we're going to be bored out of our fucking minds
[3:40:46] <+lewdmuffin> healers only attack should be the auto attack hueuhue
[3:40:46] <Tucker0603> still gotta have some dps for story stuff
[3:40:46] <%thesoddenknight> I am onboard for this
[3:40:47] <transporterthesequel> Other SCHOLARS, basically
[3:40:48] <arknodem> When buffs are done, we dps.
[3:40:50] <Fujiwara_92> b
[3:40:50] <vierleger> They said they're emphasizing healing, not removing DPS
[3:40:51] <DevinMayCry> They wont do pure healing and only healing. And anyone who refuses to do damage when nothing to do is bad
[3:40:53] <$valriot> Yeyeyeye
[3:40:55] <Ravoric> Damage will sitll happen it just WONT be so important
[3:40:55] <cizal11> @Madbearv i've cleared a lot of content fast as fuck because the healer decided to dps. you just had bad ones
[3:40:59] <raziel_zero> @AngriestPat Hey Pat (or anyone else here), what's your opinion on RDM? Would you recommend it? It seems easy but fun enough, and I heard that others like SAM are locked out even in non-meta just for being "selfish". Kinda disheartening. Mainly going for casual play.
[3:40:59] <%crowsloft77> I'm still gonna dps doodBait
[3:41:00] <BunnyEmperor> So all the new players who play healer and do nothing but stand there and heal now get to do what they always did , nothing LUL
[3:41:01] <$valriot> YE IT DID
[3:41:01] <%thesoddenknight> DPS as WHM was never fun
[3:41:02] <transporterthesequel> Wait is AFK healing GONE for Scholar?!
[3:41:03] <+Akabane101> But I would dps like a mad man as healer :(
[3:41:05] <silver__viii> They're obviously gonna have a kit based on damage and they can throw them out when necessary, I mean you have to be able to get through the game's content with a Healer in the first place
[3:41:08] <%KnightReis> unless they change the way damage comes in its going to get boring
[3:41:10] <haitakaa> "pure healing role" pretty much means no dps tho
[3:41:10] <Angry_Ev1L> In savage healers will need to do maximum of their dps either way lol
[3:41:11] <arknodem> On the flipside, holy fuck, not worrying about DPS will be a fuckin' relief.
[3:41:11] <deadhorsepersonified> its when people screw up or when one healer doesn't wanna heal, forcing the other to do most of the work, is where healer dps drops off drastically
[3:41:17] <+SirBearic> they are still going to have offensive spells, they need to be able to do solo content still
[3:41:19] <arknodem> Though I will miss Broil spams.
[3:41:21] <theworstgamer77> They are closing the gap between low skill and high skill players, in other words, it may be easy/boring to some now.
[3:41:24] <redeight8> i get a thick fairy and can no longer attack her
[3:41:33] <Snarksmith> RDM is always going to have a place so long as it has an on demand instant cast rez
[3:41:33] <%Ascethetic> WHM is mobile now
[3:41:35] <deadhorsepersonified> but yes, some tanks are just bad, and require more healing
[3:41:38] <Monkeyweed21> @raziel_zero for casual play any class is viable, RDM are very easy class for beginners
[3:41:39] <+doctor_piranha> @raziel_zero It's fun. Like a delicate dance. If you're just doing casual play then yeah fuckin go for it
[3:41:39] <Dastardry> I'll just continue spamming Holy
[3:41:52] <Angry_Ev1L> It was already the case
[3:41:54] <Basch71> yeah cuz dpsing even as a WHM kinda sucked
[3:41:54] <cizal11> that was ALREADY TRUE
[3:41:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> So healing is easier
[3:42:01] <Atzumo_Kayami> Broil spam is so much fun compared to managing 5 DoT as a scholar, remove more DPS abilities!
[3:42:02] <%Kirijuo> Turns out that shitty tank Pat had the other day just had a sneak peak at the expansion
[3:42:02] <CaptainFrankincense> no dps should do even more dps to compensate
[3:42:03] <+Grayhammatter> sweet
[3:42:06] <raziel_zero> Thanks people, that's reassuring!
[3:42:07] <marokai> The "everything is incredibly easy to play now" expansion
[3:42:11] <vierleger> I've had DPS players who stand in AoEs who need healing constantly, but still yell at me for not DPSing enough.
[3:42:13] <$valriot> Healers got forced to HARD DPS which was uncomfortable for content
[3:42:14] <BunnyEmperor> It was already just that, i think they phrased this wrong or shouldnt have mentioned anything at all, if this is the case
[3:42:15] <%KnightReis> implying holy isn't actually hallowed ground on mobs with 10 seconds of stun
[3:42:17] <jackythefrost> @cizal11 Nah. Healers often out DPS'ed tanks
[3:42:19] <$Tuskor13> a what
[3:42:20] <ChoculaUltra> blily
[3:42:20] <%IAmAkiva> @AngriestPat You notice the utter lack of BLU news? LMAO

[3:42:22] <JoshTheFace> PogChamp
[3:42:22] <%templar010> I just got back and thank fuck. Sorry for being a shitter but I cant wait for healing to be easier. Ill do it more often for sure

[3:42:41] <+borous> Tanks tank healers heal dps deeps
[3:42:41] <Ravoric> PURE HEALER (talks about offensive damage spell) LUL
[3:42:41] <Tucker0603> i have a headache from marking out...

[3:42:53] <+JEiddew> african american lily
[3:42:54] <redeight8> and thick fairy
[3:43:02] <+sgt_booyah> Pure healing is boring and is a change for casual babbies
[3:43:03] <%gespenst25> why is your DPS more important you stupid tank BibleThump
[3:43:08] <$valriot> SCH is alreasy GOAT so
[3:43:13] <%Taisuru> Umm umm
[3:43:14] <Applecannon63> Gebera?
[3:43:21] <Crushter> because we're hitting the boss the entire time @gespenst25
[3:43:22] <MittinsKittens> "other the healer jobs". The other two you mean :D
[3:43:23] <vierleger> if you want to play healer DPS, play RDM
[3:43:28] <skewerstar> Just dropped in, did they talk about the gunblade class?
[3:43:28] <Ravoric> So, are we gonna be yelling at tanks now to up their damage?
[3:43:30] <$valriot> NORMALISED HEALING
[3:43:32] <Angry_Ev1L> Scholar can fucking heal now? amazing
[3:43:32] <+miguelrod777> TANK BIAS
[3:43:33] <MrDonTacos_> umm
[3:43:34] <$valriot> FUCKING YES
[3:43:35] <Forester_Skippy> wooh tank does dps, healers adjust
[3:43:35] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[3:43:42] <Tucker0603> nice
[3:43:44] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! I started FF14 in order to play machinist. ended up playing bard the whole way through because of how grim playing machinist was. super keen to try the new one with muh drill robot
[3:43:47] <sarg1010> Protect is being removed??? Sorry I just got here
[3:43:50] <zepelinnn> "But i dont want to do more! I want to HEAL! Im good at healing! You cant make me do those other things!"
[3:43:51] <JoshTheFace> good
[3:43:52] <arknodem> Nice.
[3:43:53] <redeight8> SHE USED TO BE GOOD
[3:43:55] <cizal11> @Angry_Ev1L what are you talking about it was already the strongest healer
[3:43:55] <moogleboy1984> healer is being removed
[3:43:56] <+Grayhammatter> sweet
[3:43:58] <+oOZtkOo> just skins now
[3:43:59] <zajoestar> selene best girl
[3:43:59] <arknodem> That's a good change
[3:43:59] <Angry_Ev1L> All tanks are now the same, all healers are the same and also eveybody is a summoner Kappa xenoBrain xenoBrain xenoBrain
[3:44:00] <darkliff2> @sarg1010 yeah its gone
[3:44:04] <BunnyEmperor> Selene is not the better one skill wise Pat LUL
[3:44:07] <sarg1010> What did Protect do to deserve this fate
[3:44:07] <%Agami23> rimmy tim fairy?
[3:44:08] <%PharosOfLight> oh no, fairy wifu wars now?
[3:44:08] <$OmegaWeltall> Selene >>>>>> Eos
[3:44:09] <%BlancoRico> thats crazy talk pat
[3:44:10] <+MightyMarlowe> all sch faeries are queen
[3:44:12] <%templar010> GOOD
[3:44:13] <%thesoddenknight> Pat froze
[3:44:15] <Angry_Ev1L> @cizal11 what I'm taking about? are you watching the stream?
[3:44:16] <redeight8> sexy seraph
[3:44:18] <%SolidusRex> Faeries are for lewd
[3:44:21] <%templar010> Thats my secondary main
[3:44:21] <+JEiddew> as a sch, i am very wary
[3:44:21] <%Takreth> Selene is better for early pulls then you switch to Eos to reduce GCDs
[3:44:22] <indig0bird> How could you say something so true yet so true?
[3:44:23] <+AndrewoidMk2> i always had fun playing sch tho
[3:44:26] <%torusendor> Eos is a trash waifu
[3:44:26] <%PharosOfLight> I dunno, I'm nervous about only 2 aethercharges
[3:44:28] <+KSabot> i'm not excited as a sch
[3:44:29] <%templar010> Arc I mean
[3:44:30] <MittinsKittens> What can you summon did they say?
[3:44:33] <+JyrzRM> SMN was always fun
[3:44:34] <%MasterDecoder> @MightyMarlowe If they breath they're a thot
[3:44:39] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Atzumo_Kayami) (warning)
[3:44:40] <+Grayhammatter> seraph
[3:44:41] <Applecannon63> when carbuncle get buffs?
[3:44:45] <Atzumo_Kayami> SO MUCH FUN
[3:44:47] <+KSabot> seraph should give a fucking nuts shield and not a heal
[3:44:49] <Morsuzado> stormblood scholar was awful at launch, and it only somewhat recovered.
[3:44:52] <$valriot> I hope that replaces the Absorb Fairy skill, that skill sucks
[3:44:55] <%BaeD_JD> im so hype for all the healers i play
[3:44:58] <cizal11> @AngriestPat because you're a coward afraid to dps
[3:44:58] <%NWR_James> Oh man I took a nap and we still goin
[3:45:00] <vierleger> Even after they explained it, I literally still have no idea how AST works now. And I'm an AST main
[3:45:01] <Angry_Ev1L> More egi glamours when Kappa
[3:45:01] <%KnightReis> the entire cnj quest line in confusion as sylphie's "i only heal bitch" attitude is vindicated despite the entire line being against it
[3:45:03] <BunnyEmperor> I think Seraph used a barrier move in the preview
[3:45:08] <Applecannon63> give Cabruncle some buffs?
[3:45:14] <caribbean_samurai> SMN and DRK are Stand Users now
[3:45:20] <%Ascethetic> @vierleger you and me both
[3:45:20] <deadhorsepersonified> SCH gonna have to heal now, and have less capability to abuse their co-healer
[3:45:23] <+JEiddew> @valriot Dissipation is good to finish off bosses where the early energy drains can make the difference
[3:45:23] <+leonaflur> so long as they keep the "eat fairy" button
[3:45:24] <+JyrzRM> Whens Shiva-egi?!
[3:45:27] <BappoSama> Healers will now FORCE you to absorb all of their healing juices.
[3:45:28] <+BioHunter> wheres titan?
[3:45:28] <marokai> Why would this make someone excited to be a healer. As a main healer this feels like I should just be watching netflix while playing at this point.
[3:45:29] <%PharosOfLight> @vierleger seems like you can saw "this card always goes to DPS" so you dont have to target anymore? And certain cards in order give specials?
[3:45:30] <zepelinnn> if the party doesnt need healing you DPS COWARD
[3:45:33] <maegra> AST now requires a VR headset and a Duel Disk to play.
[3:45:33] <MittinsKittens> Wonder if they're actually going to say what the cards are actually do now.
[3:45:34] <arknodem> Did AST need card reworks?
[3:45:34] <azacca_bitter> aero's still got my back damnit
[3:45:35] <%MisterTylerrr> I'm a coward who won't heal...but I might try it now
[3:45:37] <rekinom> healsluts confirmed only real role
[3:45:39] <+Grayhammatter> \
[3:45:40] <Fujiwara_92> TIME TO DUEL SwiftRage
[3:45:42] <Angry_Ev1L> MORE DPS = less healing
[3:45:43] <Ravoric> This could also mean the damage intake is gonna be WAY higher in this expansion
[3:45:43] <%Mateus84723> You're opinions are bad Pat
[3:45:44] <%Solshine11> When’s Zurvan Egi???
[3:45:45] <arknodem> Like, I'm actually curious.
[3:45:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> There's a difference between doing your job and helping other people with their job, one is much much more important
[3:45:46] <Forester_Skippy> what about spire?
[3:45:50] <deadhorsepersonified> not really, cards weren't bad
[3:45:51] <gekizenbu> MONSTA CARDO
[3:45:52] <+JEiddew> what ABOUT spire
[3:45:54] <zecht89> i'd rather not wait 30mins LUL
[3:46:00] <MittinsKittens> All the cards?
[3:46:02] <%Ahack13> Cards absolutely needed a rework
[3:46:04] <MittinsKittens> Did I hear that right
[3:46:08] <bestwaifuritsu> fuck Spire
[3:46:10] <Forester_Skippy> spire might be direct hit
[3:46:10] <%Ahack13> There was only one tyhat anyone cared about
[3:46:12] <Monkeyweed21> Healers must focus harder on being cruel gods of life and death
[3:46:13] <cizal11> @AngriestPat they aren't going to have any more buffs than they have right this second. they're just losing things.
[3:46:13] <deadhorsepersonified> spire was mostly useless still tho
[3:46:13] <+DoctorDerp388> i might actually level a dps now with so many more tanks and healers in df
[3:46:14] <%KnightReis> if bosses dealt enough damage to require constant healing you'd generally run out of MP real quick
[3:46:15] <%Taisuru> Spire is DH buff I bet
[3:46:15] <Angry_Ev1L> I didn't want that balance anyway baka
[3:46:16] <ShutUpAceyP> spire does attack buff?
[3:46:17] <+Stereotreme> Spire buffs Direct Hit now
[3:46:18] <transporterthesequel> Astro+Dancer Mandatory calling it
[3:46:18] <sjcodan> Isnt is pronounced ASTRAL A GEN
[3:46:20] <%Venhammer> @marokai It sounds like its gonna be way harder keeping the party alive
[3:46:21] <%gespenst25> the whole challenge of healers was doing as much DPS as possible while doing the healing you need
[3:46:29] <vierleger> There will still be 6 cards. The fact that there are 6 major arcana is very important in terms of lore.
[3:46:30] <+JEiddew> exactly
[3:46:32] <Soulsbjorne> i hear all the time i discord " shit" "i didnt draw the card i wanted"
[3:46:32] <ShutUpAceyP> healers made easy
[3:46:33] <%clempstwitch> this live letter is such a beast
[3:46:33] <+doctor_piranha> Yeah Spire is likely a different buff like DH now
[3:46:41] <%QuadraticGravity> Oh thank god that's huge
[3:46:42] <%Ascethetic> FINALLY
[3:46:46] <%averageliftsdonequick> Machinist became mechanist and that makes me happyface
[3:46:47] <Foggysheep> PogChamp
[3:46:52] <maegra> Spire now allows you to draw two more cards from your deck.
[3:46:56] <haveswordmuststing> @gespenst25 and also baby sitting the DRG Kappa
[3:46:56] <+leonaflur> now my pocket healer has no reason to play how low will you go with my health.....but she still will im sure
[3:46:57] <Ravoric> Machinist looks soooo awesome
[3:47:01] <Morsuzado> the challenge of healer was carrying a bunch of people that stood in Aoe's because they didn't want to interrupt their dps rotation.
[3:47:02] <Angry_Ev1L> no conflict? lmao just roll 5 balances 4Head
[3:47:02] <$valriot> @gespenst25 Thats because content didnt make you heal and didnt make DPS stronger
[3:47:02] <bestwaifuritsu> Spire: What is my purpose, Yoshi: You make The Balance an aoe
[3:47:06] <+RhymesWithWasabi> @clempstwitch what do you think about MCH?
[3:47:06] <%templar010> Pat you dont look happy
[3:47:07] <redeight8> pat im gonna need longer podcasts to give me something to do while healing
[3:47:11] <Finaldragoon> SUPER STANCE
[3:47:14] <%Laecerelius> Dude these Mechanist changes have me SOOOO excited. I was really disappointed in the class when it came out.
[3:47:15] <+JEiddew> Healers had a similar, clear goal - do as much DPS as possible while keeping the party alive. Now focusing only on healing is fuckin weird.
[3:47:15] <MittinsKittens> @maegra I use Pot of Spire, Which allows me to draw TWO ADDITIONAL CARDS
[3:47:17] <ShutUpAceyP> combine sztances!
[3:47:17] <vierleger> That's... pretty fuggin cool
[3:47:18] <+Grayhammatter> super stance dance
[3:47:20] <Cycrosa> STANCE DANCE?
[3:47:20] <indig0bird> Hawt
[3:47:22] <%templar010> GOOD
[3:47:23] <deadhorsepersonified> super stance sounds kinda good
[3:47:24] <theobble> stance chages in combat?
[3:47:25] <$Valdorick> To access STANDS!?
[3:47:26] <BunnyEmperor> Yep stance dances
[3:47:28] <%KnightReis> what does SPIRE DO?
[3:47:31] <ShutUpAceyP> dance dps and stance healer
[3:47:33] <AmericanaRed> Jojo ThunBeast
[3:47:34] <%templar010> STANDO?!
[3:47:37] <Monkeyweed21> Healers STILL DPS, just have to heal harder too
[3:47:40] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Kurogane_Dread)
[3:47:41] <chris_babaganoosh05> Leaks talked about a spell that lets AST be in both sects at the same time for a duration
[3:47:43] <vierleger> AST always had stances

[3:48:04] <切捨御免> pat is bleeding from his soul
[3:48:09] <Atzumo_Kayami> I don't understand how removing DPS abilities for healers is a good thing
[3:48:12] <Angry_Ev1L> Stream FF more mr INFLUENCER
[3:48:20] <+TheImmortal70> If Healers don't dps anymore, REGULAR Dps has to become fuckin insane
[3:48:21] <ShutUpAceyP> become the influencer pat!

[3:48:39] <Soulsbjorne> healers shouldnt heal.....thats why they are healers not dps
[3:48:39] <%burningface> Healers have to do at least some DPS, because they have to clear solo content
[3:48:40] <%Rawklobstah88> Poor YoshiP D:
[3:48:43] <Crushter> i don't understand why people think Holy and other damage skills are gone from healers
[3:48:44] <Angry_Ev1L> Every fucking dumbass healr without good dps will be fucking kicked
[3:48:44] <silver__viii> Healers are obviously gonna keep dps abilities and skills, it's just not their focus

[3:50:50] <azure_king_drac> johnny sixteen guns
[3:50:51] <indig0bird> Ninja is a really fun job, there's nothing to fix there
[3:50:53] <%gespenst25> *** oof
[3:50:58] <vierleger> The only change to DPS I want is this: playing DPS removes your ability to use uppercase letters in chat
[3:51:01] <+JEiddew> r e v i e w e d
[3:51:02] <sjcodan> As a MCH player on the side, that makes perfect sense
[3:51:06] <Valask> stone is now stone 2 Jebaited
[3:51:09] <transporterthesequel> taken out back and SHOT
[3:51:15] <+davos_southway> Ninja is really fun :D
[3:51:27] <Angry_Ev1L> add ingame parser so I'd be able to shame players Kappa
[3:51:29] <indig0bird> Redmage is a blast too
[3:51:30] <%Takreth> Boy do I sure love using stone only
[3:51:30] <%yeknomlive> @indig0bird I love ninja but they're only used as a trick attack generator
[3:51:31] <theobble> sam is fine tho
[3:51:33] <+Grayhammatter> dragoon is so obtuse
[3:51:33] <%Ninestempest> wtf red mage is SUPER SIMPLE THO

[3:51:48] <Z1PH3R> RDM is flowcharty tho
[3:51:48] <+DoctorDerp388> gee mnk why do you get 4 stacks
[3:51:49] <%Taisuru> Red mage is really simple, and I MAIN RDM

[3:51:52] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Yeah! That's why I love RDM!
[3:51:53] <BappoSama> THERE'S A NINJA CLASS!?
[3:51:54] <+JEiddew> yeah RDM is very fluid
[3:51:54] <vierleger> Add an in-game parser that just makes up the numbers
[3:51:55] <Monkeyweed21> JOHN MADDEN
[3:52:01] <BappoSama> I need this game asap
[3:52:01] <%Ninestempest> BLM is really fucking weird though ngl
[3:52:04] <+doctor_piranha> RDM is so easy even I can play it,.... jeeez

[3:52:08] <%PharosOfLight> @BappoSama yeah and they're getting shadow clones
[3:52:10] <BunnyEmperor> Simplifying RDM doesn't really make sense, how can you make the easiest job in the game easier LUL
[3:52:10] <%Kirby_Sauce> Hey. Playing p5, which confidants should I prioritize?
[3:52:10] <%Ninestempest> the most bizarre fucking job
[3:52:11] <+CronoMagnum> NIN is my favorite! Gimme dem Mudras!
[3:52:14] <%Shikari21> RDM is super fun
[3:52:16] <$valriot> DPS CUCKS LUL LUL
[3:52:17] <%QuadraticGravity> @BappoSama Yeah man, Ninja does handsigns and crazy flip combos. Been in since 2.0
[3:52:18] <切捨御免> guys, these are the classes that are getting a direct evolution of what they were in stormblood, as opposed to complete reworks
[3:52:23] <azure_king_drac> wait red mage is dps
[3:52:24] <theycallmenox> cack sucka
[3:52:24] <moosemonkey397> i love blm yall are crazy
[3:52:25] <%Takreth> BLM is super fun because it forces you to learn the fight to optimize not moving
[3:52:25] <redeight8> i dont speak korean
[3:52:28] <CaptainFrankincense> DPS steal your girl
[3:52:31] <indig0bird> BLM is fun mostly because BIG NUMBER
[3:52:35] <BappoSama> I've never even seen this game before so i didn't know. D:
[3:52:36] <+JEiddew> I find BLM rotation fine but maybe it's just because I'm used to it. SMN was really the weirdo, but now they're reworked.
[3:52:37] <Monkeyweed21> Just better versions from Stormblood
[3:52:38] <+Grizzytron> is the audio real that bad
[3:52:39] <Level10Biscuit> There was a ninja the whole time, but you couldn't see them Kappa
[3:52:40] <%burningface> @Kirby_Sauce Get Kawakami as early as possible
[3:52:42] <AmericanaRed> The chad DPS
[3:52:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I play RDM so I focus less on rotation and job mechanics and focus more on the battle itself

[3:54:20] <silver__viii> Hey cool that sounds like Monks won't get fucked by mechanics now
[3:54:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> The whispers won't stop...
[3:54:25] <%BlackMage66652> @luftraumm1 It's bad
[3:54:26] <cizal11> @SaltyGuyMan bard was one of the most fun classes in stormblood. unclear how it's gonna be in this expac
[3:54:27] <BunnyEmperor> So you can meditate greased during transition phases like ultimate sequences where you cant do anything anyway as dps
[3:54:27] <BappoSama> Cool, thanks guys! I've decided to get this game on PS4 ASAP. Are all of these classes available at the start or do you have to do a specific class change quest?

[3:55:33] <%QuadraticGravity> Finally.
[3:55:34] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @bapposama some are at the start and gotta lvl them to access them and some are in the later areas to access
[3:55:41] <Z1PH3R> Manging heavy trust was a pain
[3:55:43] <silver__viii> That fucked with rotation a bit That's not a bad change
[3:55:47] <rekinom> baby job for babies
[3:55:47] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Aww but I liked Heavy thrust mischaGasm
[3:55:53] <Tucker0603> it's the stupid buff
[3:55:53] <transporterthesequel> HT was Dragoon's only side positional, and it was fucking TERRIBLE
[3:55:55] <%crowsloft77> @bapposama scracth that. once you hit HW all those jobs unlock
[3:55:56] <theobble> NOBODY LIKES HT
[3:55:56] <%SolidusRex> Fart in piss Heavy Thrust
[3:55:56] <mustyketchup> HT is the personal attack boost
[3:55:59] <Pixelrin> one hit buff
[3:56:01] <%Shikari21> Heavy thrust is dumb
[3:56:01] <BappoSama> Awesome. I'm honestly only interested in Ninja though, but thanks for the info.
[3:56:04] <bestwaifuritsu> double midareeeeeeee
[3:56:06] <soliammurr> it's the move that buffs your damage at the flank
[3:56:06] <indig0bird> I dunno but I feel it just interrupts my rotation
[3:56:06] <cizal11> @transporterthesequel wheeling thrust was side also
[3:56:08] <Forester_Skippy> we all did
[3:56:09] <delicious_mystery> there are around 3 jobs per city, most agree limsa lominsa which gives warrior, summoner, scholar and ninja is the best area for players to start in nowadays
[3:56:11] <+arbiduck> @transporterthesequel Fang and claw tho
[3:56:11] <Tucker0603> everyone hates heavy thrust
[3:56:14] <%Agami23> but what about blue mage?!
[3:56:17] <ShutUpAceyP> side trhusts don't work
[3:56:18] <Soulsbjorne> heavy thrust was fine just weave it in every 30 sec its 1 button activate
[3:56:18] <+Reizie_Etherealm> She's not familiar with the game lol
[3:56:19] <%Finakala> Heavy Thrust wasn't the only one though...?
[3:56:20] <%QuadraticGravity> I just hated that it was a flank ability that came RIGHT after the rear ability
[3:56:21] <theobble> haga is tghe sen eating button for kenki
[3:56:22] <NemokillerV> oh it's the attack I never used
[3:56:23] <+leonaflur> @BappoSama NIN is so much fun
[3:56:24] <Monkeyweed21> @BappoSama Ninja is lvl 10, DRK, MCH, and AST are level 30, Samurai and RDM is level 50

[4:02:00] <RadShiro> MP cost 10k????
[4:02:00] <+JEiddew> Xenoglossy is the ability to speak a language without having learned it. This sounds like a really neat trick if you can manage it. However, a typical place to find is in the Journal of Parapsychology. That's because the ability is regarded as a psychic phenomenon.
[4:02:03] <+mik255> look at that gauge
[4:02:07] <redeight8> no one does
[4:02:07] <Fujiwara_92> FUREA
[4:02:09] <indig0bird> Everything sounds sooooooooooo cool
[4:02:10] <+mercado94> @AngriestPat Did they said anything about the trust system?

[4:02:12] <sarg1010> ZETAFLARE when? We need that KH3 reference
[4:02:12] <Dastardry> You'd think Pat would like the job that is all about BIG NUMBERS

[4:03:20] <Fujiwara_92> RED IS JUST BLACK
[4:03:20] <%ThePuddingDead> wtf is THAT SHIT!?
[4:03:20] <%QuadraticGravity> I think you misunderstood
[4:03:21] <KatabolicRage> yeah I don't see it
[4:03:22] <BunnyEmperor> Nah it must be something else they meant
[4:03:23] <%Afterman_> maybe it goes down when you move while cast
[4:03:23] <sarg1010> Maybe to prevent you from storing mana from one fight to the next
[4:03:23] <vashishi> anybody have a clip of the healer breakdown?
[4:03:25] <RadShiro> I think they mean when your walking around AFTER battles
[4:03:30] <sjcodan> It didnt go down?
[4:03:32] <Sydin18> I am sure its over a certain amount of time after u casted something
[4:03:37] <RosELLo6> oh, between battles
[4:03:38] <%Niney_Who> Maybe they mean between battles
[4:03:41] <silver__viii> That probably just means you cant stockpile gauge inbetween fights
[4:03:44] <Tucker0603> big liars
[4:03:45] <%PharosOfLight> Out of combat? myabe?
[4:03:46] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah between battles ok fine

[4:03:47] <cizal11> lmao yoship is really bad at rdm
[4:03:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I love RDM cause I love the freedom it gives me to do whatever
[4:03:52] <arknodem> Ohhhhh
[4:03:53] <SomersaultJustice> maybe it was mistranslated
[4:03:53] <%ThePuddingDead> its....
[4:03:54] <DarkSideCow> probably mis spoke
[4:03:55] <arknodem> That makes sense.
[4:03:56] <SomersaultJustice> ohhhhh
[4:03:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Oh
[4:03:57] <chaosbuckle> Ah
[4:03:58] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Oh thank god, phew
[4:04:00] <KatabolicRage> I didn't see it deplete even between fights though
[4:04:01] <chaosbuckle> thats not bad
[4:04:01] <deadhorsepersonified> big good lies. no need for it to deplete
[4:04:04] <Saisher> wheew

[4:08:48] <BunnyEmperor> GUNOMMING ALEXANDERU PRIMU
[4:08:50] <$Big_King_Coconut> Make Edgar proud
[4:08:52] <%crowsloft77> thanks god
[4:08:53] <Tucker0603> Fuck of Gauss barrel
[4:08:53] <+Grayhammatter> yes!
[4:08:54] <+HelloImTom08> YES fuck Gbarrel
[4:08:54] <+DoctorDerp388> fuuuuuuuuk ammo and gauss
[4:08:55] <atomicdestruction> Nice that was tedious
[4:08:55] <KatabolicRage> gauss barrel is a 10/10 change, it's so fucking terrible
[4:08:56] <JoshTheFace> hell yeah
[4:08:56] <Applecannon63> MACHINIST ROBOT=Alt Eisen
[4:08:58] <+ClaireBearz> you could hide the guass barrel
[4:09:04] <KatabolicRage> the hide was client side
[4:09:08] <irontatsumi> Alt Eisen go go go!
[4:09:09] <silver__viii> Oh fuck yeah that was so ugly they gave you the option to disable it
[4:09:11] <+ClaireBearz> rooShrug
[4:09:13] <GingerSen> you can only hide it for yourself
[4:09:13] <TheHoodKnight> Wow no gauss barrel or ammo damn thats huge
[4:09:13] <KatabolicRage> so you'd still see other peoples, and they'd still see yours
[4:09:14] <$Big_King_Coconut> Give us more than three bullets
[4:09:19] <$valriot> Im so happy with these change, MCH is my DPS when im not healing, so happy
[4:09:23] <r_Foeburden87> so BRD SMNN MCN share token nmmaybe? wierd
[4:09:24] <BunnyEmperor> And showing off glamors is important
[4:09:25] <GigatonBeatdown> Can they let us hide that hip aether pack thing?
[4:09:27] <%PharosOfLight> Pistols looked so dumb with that barrel
[4:09:27] <Binarypony> theres no bullets
[4:09:27] <%arcaderabbit48> I understand the idea behind Gauss Barrel, but it certainly wasn't the most exciting thing. And it clashed a lot with certain gun styles
[4:09:30] <arknodem> Hmm.... Now I'm wondering if I should level MCH to come up to patch.
[4:09:30] <Sydin18> NO GO BACK
[4:09:35] <Binarypony> no
[4:09:35] <CaptainFrankincense> everyone could see your shitty fashion
[4:09:38] <moogleboy1984> Pat thinks people look at other players
[4:09:39] <skewerstar> Is the robot powered by Bonito?
[4:09:42] <Binarypony> machinist sucks to level
[4:09:45] <corepercentlives> Is pat the asmongold of ff14? PixelBob
[4:09:47] <Morsuzado> purple pea shooter glamor forever
[4:09:51] <Angry_Ev1L> what
[4:09:52] <Binarypony> better to level it with the shiny new skills
[4:10:02] <+leonaflur> @skewerstar robots are powered by trumpets
[4:10:06] <Binarypony> current machinist is a clunky trash fire while leveling
[4:10:06] <%PharosOfLight> @corepercentlives i think thats Mr.Happy
[4:10:07] <+HelloImTom08> not confident in that statement
[4:10:10] <cizal11> did anything she just said make sense
[4:10:12] <%blastazoid26> intant!
[4:10:14] <$Valdorick> @corepercentlives Not enough "Pat Reacts - YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID" youtube recs in my feed for that to be true.
[4:10:16] <Skaw_Lann> eggy?
[4:10:18] <+DoctorDerp388> instant eggies
[4:10:19] <%arcaderabbit48> @arknodem I'm going to wait, because it sounds like you'll have to relearn the whole class. Like, Ammo is something you get as soon as you unlock the class. Removing that and Gauss completely changes the class
[4:10:19] <$Big_King_Coconut> Eggy
[4:10:21] <Skaw_Lann> like leggy
[4:10:23] <TraceBullet> iggy
[4:10:23] <r_Foeburden87> Egi*

[4:10:47] <+JEiddew> Faerie glamours please
[4:10:52] <+Patware> so happy to hear machinist is going to be made not infuriating to play
[4:10:52] <%PharosOfLight> yes egi glamours please...
[4:10:53] <BunnyEmperor> Pat, stop trying to JoJo everything LUL
[4:10:53] <%Taisuru> I wish they'd show it
[4:10:55] <+mercilust> There are glamors for egis?
[4:10:56] <+Koagz> can we get the mch summon as a mount, please
[4:11:01] <%IAmAkiva> Can I offer you a nice egg in this tryin' time?
[4:11:01] <arknodem> That'd be dope Pat.
[4:11:04] <theobble> I gotta say the idea of a MCH without having to place shitty turrets is pretty appealing
[4:11:04] <%Sora20030c> Sora20030c subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[4:11:04] <CaptainFrankincense> eggy weggy hehe

[4:11:15] <%PharosOfLight> @mercilust just that you can turn them into Carbuncles
[4:11:16] <silver__viii> @mercilust Sort of, you can just slap on the different Carbuncles on them.
[4:11:19] <arknodem> Egi glams. lol
[4:11:19] <%arcaderabbit48> I want Ifrit to grab my crotch while I lift both hands above my head and wink. Give me JoJo poses, dammit!

[4:21:02] <theobble> People are going to complain about this guaranteed
[4:21:02] <junks2300> So this just isn't gonna work if you have latency, right?
[4:21:02] <+MisterCrimson> 30% crit and direct rate for a minute? Jesus fuck

[4:22:41] <wookie5358> she dances so terribly that things drop dead
[4:22:42] <silver__viii> I'm having a hard time following, I think I'm gonna need to play it myself to understand
[4:22:44] <indig0bird> @crowsloft77 thanks c:
[4:22:44] <%averageliftsdonequick> like unleash?
[4:22:45] <%Finakala> I can't even comprehend how ridiculous BRD/DNC combo could be
[4:22:46] <切捨御免> so if you're close to a target the attacks are pbaoes and if you're far they're single target?
[4:22:49] <undeuxtroisqua> YA! VoHiYo YA! VoHiYo YA! VoHiYo
[4:22:50] <zecht89> why wasn't this a healer lmao
[4:22:51] <+MaddyCaddy> All those buffs

[4:22:52] <weeters> that's alot of buffs
[4:22:54] <Finaldragoon> THAT'S A LOT OF BUFFS
[4:22:55] <+MaddyCaddy> Holy damn
[4:22:56] <BunnyEmperor> The battle music sounds pretty good, kind of like the trailer theme
[4:22:57] <IFlaske> distance sensitive attack spells, got it
[4:22:57] <CaptainFrankincense> SAM and DCR getting kenki
[4:23:01] <Flarepulse> I can't believe they made that dancing baby gif into a Final Fantasy character
[4:23:04] <+Tokanova> oh it has a dash
[4:23:05] <Aydarkzero> the square stream is still going?
[4:23:05] <+Tokanova> thats cool
[4:23:06] <silver__viii> That dash gets me rock solid
[4:23:08] <+yoshkosh20> I'm switchin from dragoon todancer.
[4:23:09] <CurrySauseBandit> This job seems super simple.
[4:23:09] <%QuadraticGravity> that dude had like nine buffs
[4:23:09] <Derkinstacker> Move and dance
[4:23:13] <+JEiddew> There's nothing wrong with making a difficult to play job D:
[4:23:13] <+Nomicro4u> JUST DANCE
[4:23:14] <$Valdorick> Is that elf boy Pat was talking about yesterday going to reveal he was a dancer all along, and give you those come hither eyes as he... ahem... Buffs your DPS.
[4:23:19] <Tucker0603> give them a Dab
[4:23:19] <transporterthesequel> I cannot see a world where Dancer does not have a mandatory spot in a raid
[4:23:23] <TootWootKeza> Ninja's are going to find this fun
[4:23:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> Towns are gunna be rife with that shit
[4:23:27] <%NWR_James> Shh, pat's lookin sleepy
[4:23:29] <smokecock420> @zecht89 If this was a healer white mage would never get used again LUL
[4:23:30] <Forester_Skippy> those numbers arnt that high tho
[4:23:30] <Gieron667> it JUST works

[4:23:50] <theobble> i n f l u e n c e r s
[4:23:51] <CaptainFrankincense> the dab is the highest potency attack in the game
[4:23:51] <%MattDemers> Is lancer a good first class? I got to maybe 20 with an MRD and found it pretty boring
[4:23:52] <+doctor_piranha> DDR
[4:23:52] <Dastardry> 30% crit/direct hit buff. Dancers personal dps must be near non-existent
[4:23:52] <%ThePuddingDead> "influencers"
[4:23:53] <%Taisuru> (ddr)
[4:23:54] <Derkinstacker> which one?
[4:23:55] <+MaddyCaddy> Patapon?
[4:23:57] <$Big_King_Coconut> "a certain rhythm type game"
[4:23:59] <+Nomicro4u> mildo
[4:23:59] <$valriot> @transporterthesequel They look like they have shit dps, so you need both a top tier DNC and Partner DPS
[4:23:59] <%averageliftsdonequick> peloton + dash = every mountless town movement macro
[4:23:59] <Derkinstacker> Who could know
[4:24:05] <OkamiDude15> Pat is very disgruntled about the potato dancer
[4:24:08] <Fujiwara_92> DDR
[4:24:09] <corepercentlives> inject red bull pat you're looking sleepy
[4:24:10] <indig0bird> I really wanna dance

[4:24:22] <+Azarian1> The Lalafell master race
[4:24:23] <@mothmandraws> if I played id play dancer
[4:24:23] <+DoctorDerp388> forsenT
[4:24:24] <$Valdorick> Or, in other words "This shit aint Dark Knight"
[4:24:24] <Darkmega97> Make me laugh tiny ginger man
[4:24:24] <+doctor_piranha> fuck lalas
[4:24:26] <@mothmandraws> looks fun
[4:24:28] <切捨御免> LUL
[4:24:29] <切捨御免> true
[4:24:29] <$jobbedbone> lalafells are dumb
[4:24:30] <%topendbuzz> yes
[4:24:31] <silver__viii> DNC seems super legit but if you're subpar with the dances you're gonna have a bad time
[4:24:32] <theobble> it's not even what yoshida plays
[4:24:33] <silver__viii> RIGHT
[4:24:33] <TootWootKeza> LUL
[4:24:33] <Tucker0603> Fuck off with Lalas, they suck
[4:24:33] <r_Foeburden87> i have nno idea why they chose lala
[4:24:34] <%QuadraticGravity> @MattDemers Lancer/Dragoon has a very easy to learn rotation but it also has some of the worst Early game combos. As a DRG main, I can tell you it gets better.
[4:24:35] <Applecannon63> fuck Lalas~
[4:24:36] <undeuxtroisqua> YA! VoHiYo YA! VoHiYo
[4:24:36] <TioXyco> that's the point
[4:24:37] <%yeknomlive> did I miss the dancer overview?
[4:24:38] <%averageliftsdonequick> pat confirmed for tiny eyes
[4:24:39] <+DoctorDerp388> you don't pay yoshi' sub
[4:24:39] <theobble> his actual main is an au ra
[4:24:40] <%korth367> ur just blind lol
[4:24:41] <+Baron_VonCookies> I wanna see male dancers though
[4:24:41] <+mercado94> you're blind
[4:24:42] <%GingaNZ> damn right
[4:24:43] <BunnyEmperor> True, it is not a good choice, should pick Roe or Hyur
[4:24:43] <%BaeD_JD> no but i play lala so this is nice :)
[4:24:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Dancer the buff master - I sleep, Gunbreaker the nero tank - real shit?
[4:24:43] <13sin> @AngriestPat yea, they should have used one of the 2 new races
[4:24:44] <badhaye> that may be intentional
[4:24:45] <+Nomicro4u> the potatoes in general are distressing to look at
[4:24:45] <%Taisuru> I want to boil the popotos
[4:24:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Potatos let you see the Particle effects
[4:24:46] <%Shikari21> ur just blind tbh
[4:24:46] <silver__viii> I was just thinking about that earlier, I wish it was on Viera
[4:24:47] <gunstar73> nairoLUL just mad cuz their gods
[4:24:47] <$Valdorick> Its just an oval moving slightly
[4:24:48] <Forester_Skippy> to see lala animations you need to slow it down in gpose sadly
[4:24:48] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat why are they called potatoes?
[4:24:49] <indig0bird> I like Lalas but you're 100% on the money on this
[4:24:50] <%MattDemers> @QuadraticGravity Thanks! I'm kinda just trying to figure out a good way to dive in
[4:24:50] <%Fenrirlives> GET BETTER EYES
[4:24:51] <%thesoddenknight> Your just jealous
[4:24:52] <%vincerocmm> idethe dance
[4:24:52] <Frostydough> little shits should be removed from the game
[4:24:52] <mikesapartment> cats for their expressive tails
[4:24:53] <%PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat what if thats on purpose?
[4:24:54] <%averageliftsdonequick> elezen need love too
[4:24:56] <r_Foeburden87> you'd think they would use viera
[4:24:57] <RittiFruity> Pat is discriminating against potato
[4:24:57] <%terry_quest> THIGHLANDERS
[4:24:58] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Aura or Viera
[4:24:59] <+mik255> viera
[4:24:59] <CurrySauseBandit> They probably don't want to spoil them.
[4:24:59] <Zepik> should have used Vierra just to show it off
[4:25:00] <%Taisuru> Or you know use the new races
[4:25:01] <%VioletHeart> Pat's hatred of Lalafells knows no bounds.
[4:25:02] <Saisher> or bunnies
[4:25:03] <%thesoddenknight> We're better than you
[4:25:04] <Tucker0603> yeyeye, Au Ra boys
[4:25:05] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> or use the 2 new species for the 2 new classses?????\
[4:25:09] <%BlackMage66652> apatPat apatPat apatPat

[4:25:12] <Pixelrin> YA, YA
[4:25:13] <transporterthesequel> Yes take those BIG BUFFS you big boi
[4:25:13] <alchefire> Fucking Potato people.
[4:25:14] <%PlainSimpleTailor> KYA KYA KYA
[4:25:15] <silver__viii> I don't even hate Lalafell but it's so hard to see any detail on the outfits or animations with a Lala model
[4:25:16] <jackythefrost> Elezens have the longest limbs
[4:25:17] <gekizenbu> Pat hates lalafels because he sees them in him, the dark potato within
[4:25:18] <%averageliftsdonequick> viera must be borked still
[4:25:20] <jackythefrost> not Aura
[4:25:21] <+datmegamandeeeee> Lalas are awful
[4:25:23] <televisedrevolting> So I'm gonna download FF14 in the morning cause HOLY SHIT 3 HOURS. Then play through Free Trial. If I can see myself playing this for a long time, I'll probably get the full package.
[4:25:25] <切捨御免> esprit not espirit
[4:25:26] <+DeniedPants> as a bard main, i am worried that dancer will make bard obsolete
[4:25:27] <SchroedingersFerret> Don't bulli potato PunOko
[4:25:27] <切捨御免> jesus
[4:25:27] <SweetCuppingCake> Lalas are just a reminder to Pat that he too is smol
[4:25:32] <+JEiddew> she said weaponskill, so get fucked if you're partnered with a mage?
[4:25:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The dances could be so much more appreciated with any other race
[4:25:33] <+Tokanova> pat doesn't have goblins in his head, he has lalafells
[4:25:33] <+AccioSkullar> pat hates lalafells because he is a lalafell
[4:25:37] <transporterthesequel> God Dancer macro's are gonna be glorious
[4:25:40] <Tucker0603> Lalas suck, they arent even shortstacks
[4:25:41] <BunnyEmperor> I bet he made the lala character to make it more interesting for grills and weebs
[4:25:41] <Monkeyweed21> Baked potatoes are best potatoes
[4:25:41] <SomersaultJustice> LALA used SWORD DANCE
[4:25:42] <indig0bird> Lol Sword Dance
[4:25:43] <%PROUD2beGINGER> bulli taters
[4:25:44] <$Valdorick> Taking bets on people making Dancer Macros that just have them dirty talk their dance partner?
[4:25:45] <+UKOrigin> i missed a portion, so do the dances do dps themselves or is it just downtime without damage going out?
[4:25:46] <TioXyco> sword dance? we pokemon now?
[4:25:47] <sjcodan> SWORDS DANCE
[4:25:48] <silver__viii> Honestly I wonder if you can even macro dances
[4:25:49] <indig0bird> +2 Attack
[4:25:51] <Darkmega97> He refuses to play has anything that isn't a little girl
[4:25:52] <+DoctorDerp388> need gud partner

[4:26:08] <%averageliftsdonequick> Patrick Boivick, desert lalafell
[4:26:14] <Dastardry> ACT is going to be mandatory on Dancer just like AST
[4:26:15] <Forester_Skippy> it depends on their attacks so maybe on a monk or ninja would be nice with those high skillspeeds
[4:26:17] <切捨御免> partner with the tank
[4:26:17] <%Taisuru> I think I'm ready to be done with this

[4:26:23] <BunnyEmperor> Just pair up the DNC with the WAR all the time Kappa
[4:26:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> This class is gonna suck in a 4 player party where you CAN'T choose the other DPS to partner with
[4:26:23] <%Ilpala> then it was already gonna be rough
[4:26:24] <+Tokanova> and yeah partner with the tank i guess

[4:58:55] <%averageliftsdonequick> Dark arts is "bad" because you have to keep pressing it in-between nearly every other button
[4:58:55] <haveswordmuststing> @cvp5127 any tank, but socialize man
[4:58:58] <caribbean_samurai> This was the best @angriestpat
[4:58:59] <GeltonZ> What happened?
[4:59:05] <NemokillerV> @AngriestPat You should probably mention that Heavensward will be free for a while.

[4:59:41] <conflict1914> sounds good, plenty of chances for chill time
[4:59:42] <televisedrevolting> So the subscription prices go DOWN when you get then for longer? Because the website says that 30 days is 14.99, but 180 days is 12.99?

[5:00:05] <%Jamejarrs> Let the fucker die
[5:00:06] <atomicdestruction> Vote abandon Kappa
[5:00:06] <$Valdorick> Bad tanks blame healers, because bad tanks think they can live through bad over pulls.
[5:00:07] <haveswordmuststing> @king_floppy good luck with levels 1-70 of levalling LUL
[5:00:10] <%Jamejarrs> Learn the hard way
[5:00:11] <+QuadraticGravity> Tell them to stop and try to vote kick if they refuse
[5:00:15] <aimlesshealer> There's only so much you can do. Tank's gotta know their limits
[5:00:17] <%Mateus84723> heal harder git gud
[5:00:18] <arknodem> Communication.
[5:00:19] <%King_floppy> hrrrrnh
[5:00:20] <%terry_quest> and then the tank will complain
[5:00:25] <@Pandora_Prime> Tell your tank to slow the fuck down or get some better gear.
[5:00:25] <KatabolicRage> big pulls are for level cap dungeons with tanks who are geared correctly
[5:00:27] <Jontman42> Heal faster lol
[5:00:31] <%TheSniperJoe> it's part of a tanks responsibility to set a doable pace.
[5:00:32] <KatabolicRage> in leveling dungeons it's gonna go to shit
[5:00:35] <moogleboy1984> healers adjust
[5:00:36] <+Tovald> you just can't out heal stupid

[5:02:35] <%averageliftsdonequick> yup

Also why do you keep saying Plague Tale is that dev's first game? They've done plenty of other stuff before. (Like Fuel). Keep on keeping on.
[5:02:48] <%Finakala> I play BRD with controller, it's fine
[5:02:48] <%Mateus84723> lies you're bad
[5:02:49] <r_Foeburden87> I use an nXB1 Controller on PC
[5:02:49] <nanaki_ff14> Controller here!

[5:02:50] <%Master_Van> controller is nice
[5:02:51] <sjcodan> Lies
[5:02:51] <televisedrevolting> Sweet!
[5:02:52] <%Diabetic> Controller is really good on this
[5:02:53] <$Valdorick> It use to be on consoles!
[5:02:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I love the controller
[5:02:54] <CountMeowingtonn> MACHINISTS RISE UP'-'
[5:02:54] <+metalsiren31> FF14 is fantastic with a controller
[5:03:00] <$SleepyMaribo> Controller is better in some cases
[5:03:01] <nanaki_ff14> Just look up guide on how to set up controller hotbars!
[5:03:02] <%DXLelouch24> apatDab
[5:03:02] <rekinom> I was one of those people, but controller does really well on XIV
[5:03:03] <%vaporousTippler> I wish I was better with controller. It's so comfortable over long periods.
[5:03:04] <sjcodan> I AM an asshole, but I'm right
[5:03:04] <%ElenaManetta> What if I don't have hands
[5:03:04] <+Grayhammatter> they are assholes
[5:03:04] <IFlaske> its probably the most playable mmo on the controller
[5:03:08] <%ecolli37108> I love mouse and keyboard, but controller is perfectly viable
[5:03:13] <$nitronLVIII> Kill the Keyboard
[5:03:13] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat The only thing about FF14 that makes me upset is the fact your character slides on the ground if you walk when casting abilities.
[5:03:13] <%Nobrev> I prefer m+kb but controller is definitely super viable
[5:03:14] <%averageliftsdonequick> You can bind 32 buttons to controller without even having to swap out to a different hotbar
[5:03:18] <Cerabret100> I don't know how i'd play with a controller as i rely on Mouseover macros to heal
[5:03:20] <+BaronEgo> I tried switching to controller and I dropped it after a week honestly but I can see it's viable for people
[5:03:20] <DomunDomunDomun> They're right though.
[5:03:21] <Forester_Skippy> ok i wont shit on you if you use controller but for the lov eof god use extended mapping option so you have enough slots to slot your abilities and not say thats stupid fuck you
[5:03:23] <ashuckel> controllers are easy to move around while attacking shit
