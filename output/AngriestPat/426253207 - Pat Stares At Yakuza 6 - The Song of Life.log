[0:18:55] <JamvaanPS4> Putting you hand on the babywipe cleaned the baby wipe so it's fine.

[0:19:16] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @AngriestPat there is a job I know of in my line of work where there are people who not only run hand washing stations, but have the power to tell people they have to do it or not get fed
[0:19:16] <%athuramn> is the principle to avoid flushing chemicals?
[0:19:17] <gunzerkingdunce> The rats will come for you no matter how clean your hands are
[0:19:19] <%kenpachi9211> THATS apatBig OCD

[0:20:46] <QaizerArt> @AngriestPat Please don't enjoy the whole feeling of washing your hands as that indulges your OCD. You'll start doing it more and more to the point where your hands become worse than rashes.

[0:26:10] <%spiritofmojave> Don't use your fucking nose in a headbutt
[0:26:17] <%Niney_Who> Aim for their nose
[0:26:21] <%athuramn> temples and chin, the worst place for nerve endings
[0:26:21] <televisedrevolting> Forehead to Bridge of the Nose. That's what movies taught me.
[0:26:21] <%SrG00SE> headbutting hurts like fuck no matter what
[0:26:22] <%Niney_Who> Or just punch them in th throat
[0:26:22] <@lewdskeletor13> Thank you for explaining Mr Fuggins
[0:26:24] <切捨御免> don't headbutt the mouth either, teeth are bad
[0:26:25] <+Javaa01> Hit the bridge of the nose, the nose bleeds way too much
[0:26:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@QaizerArt) (warning)
[0:26:27] <Ion_Laser> Dont do what Shibata did

[0:26:53] <%ECRead> hit the bridge of their nose with the top of your forehead
[0:26:54] <QaizerArt> NEVER headbutt samoans
[0:26:54] <+agentnuma> curl up to make youself small and when they try to hit you from above, while standing punish with the headbutt
[0:26:56] <QaizerArt> you won't win
[0:26:58] <%SrG00SE> headbutt is a desperation move no matter what cause it fucking hurts
[0:26:58] <$cureneckbeard> Pat what are some things you taught yourself wrong
[0:26:59] <Kief_Gringo> Headbutt the nose/bridge of the nose, blood, pain, hard to see.

[0:34:23] <%Rngiddion> the intelligent can be ignorant on many subjects
[0:34:23] <SilverFaustX> waves
[0:34:24] <%TheMattman1313> Also the fact that we put nuclear power in space ALL THE TIME
[0:34:25] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Is this going to end with Woolie Hulk
[0:34:26] <%Divryne> Radiation is both a particle and pure energy.
[0:34:26] <zamzoph> Bananas are irradiated
[0:34:29] <alrobot2014> particle wave duality is a fuck
[0:34:29] <AirlineFood74> LUL
[0:34:29] <Warbot40> Or how global warming worked
[0:34:30] <$cureneckbeard> Maybe you can teach Woolie about radiation and Woolie can teach you how to exercise
[0:34:31] <%spiritofmojave> Radiation is just green fart gas you'd see in PS2 games
[0:34:32] <%AncelDeLambert> coal is radioactive

[0:34:55] <person181> what?
[0:34:58] <AirlineFood74> Oh no, woolie is anti-nuclear
[0:35:00] <theobble> did he learn that from a comic book or something
[0:35:00] <DXLelouch24> Pat did you know theres a Petition to remake S8 of GoT? It has over 800k signatures i shit yu not, even the casual audience seems pissed
[0:35:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> That Chernobyl series is harrowing AF
[0:35:01] <masso101> Even the smartest people can be idiots about some things pat. You’re living proof of that. Kappa
[0:35:02] <%athuramn> will just inflict a DOT
[0:35:03] <BimboBagging> Radiation kills you in 2 seconds like in the videogames
[0:35:04] <thelonechris> Woolie should watch the Chernobyl show
[0:35:05] <%Divryne> Radiation kills you by basically destroying the atoms that make up your cells.
[0:35:08] <$jokisilent> cheer100 pat why is your hair so flipping cool??? also matt suck pat is awesome
[0:35:12] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat coal plants put out more radiation than properly working nuke plants
[0:35:16] <%Divryne> *molecular structyre.
[0:35:18] <%duneblythe> global warming
[0:35:22] <+PenmanLupine> but thats how it works in vidya games so it's gotta work that way in real life
[0:35:23] <%krispen_wa> KITTY
[0:35:24] <%Archphronimos> FUN FACT: Coal plants put out more radioactive material into the air than nuclear plants

[0:35:35] <marvel877> tell Woolie about that Elephant's Foot over in Chernobyl.
[0:35:35] <%Mornaka> Most things put out radiation
[0:35:37] <xeros720> he is worried about getting bit by radioactive spiders
[0:35:38] <%TheDullaMAN> Yeah Pat, you founded dumb
[0:35:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Everything has radiation...to some point.
[0:35:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat coal is radioactive, yes. Slightly so, but it is
[0:35:42] <%konekoryugamine> Ehhh little bit
[0:35:43] <zanzibarian_hamster> Coal burning makes particles that cause cancer, radiation burning creates bricks of death we hide in the ground

[0:35:46] <%Rngiddion> In Hiroshima
[0:35:47] <arkv01> people don't fucking understand how nuclear power is VERY safe as long as you put competent people in charge
[0:35:47] <%Divryne> Divryne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Yo Pat speaking of FFXIV, did you hear about the leaked DRK changes? Apparently they got rid of tank stances entirely and the MP regen combo has been replaced with a four-hit pure DPS combo. Overal general consensus is that DRK is more like 3.X DRK now.

[0:35:58] <%konekoryugamine> @AngriestPat Has Elmo jumped into the cube?
[0:35:59] <AMajorTom> There's so much weirdness with American nuclear power too. Like the bad decision to outlaw spent fuel reprocessing
[0:35:59] <+SolverCODO> Nuclear power rules. Modern reactors can be made in a way where they can't meltdown
[0:35:59] <%UW_Duncan> Everything emits some level of radiation
[0:36:00] <thelonechris> You heard it from the expert, folks
[0:36:00] <%vaporousTippler> Godzilla will remember that.
[0:36:00] <%Deekman> if a nuclear plant exploded pat would be merged with the cube

[0:36:03] <reonome> you can get radiation poisoning from bananas if you eat enough of them
[0:36:03] <hassanico> nukes are cool
[0:36:03] <%Ganerumo> nuclear power is a great stepladder to clean green renewable gay windmill energy
[0:36:04] <+JackMillerTime> hemp absorbs radiation
[0:36:05] <%Kataguro> Nuclear Power is great when people don't fuck up and there's no natural disasters
[0:36:06] <%Gatzarlok> The radiation present in the outflow waters of nuclear reactors has less radiation than a banana.
[0:36:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nuclear power only fails if you are a fuck and build it somewhere stupid

[0:46:51] <TheBlankAce> Well to be fair most of the companies that had games on sale didn't want to be on sale.
[0:46:52] <%Typhaeon> Epic lost its mojo when they took the "Megagames" part out

[0:47:04] <%Typhaeon> Also sold out to the Chinese
[0:47:04] <%Ganerumo> @AngriestPat maybe the store has no cart and a low fraud blocker because Fortnite is played by kids so they figured most of them wouldn't have the pocket change to buy more than one game at a time

[1:14:53] <primarch_lupercal> KIRYU SAYS NO TO SMOKING
[1:15:00] <+TopTieramisu> winner's don't do drugs
[1:15:01] <%THATGUY_789> all I get is the No Smoking so of Gintama
[1:15:02] <%DSD24> Kiryu smokes all the time in Yakuza 3 though
[1:15:03] <+mercado94> jesus dude
[1:15:03] <Zebroneath> But Kiryu smoked in Yakuzie 4
[1:15:04] <%alcors_wisdom> what you cant smoke there
[1:15:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> goddamn country bumpkins
[1:15:05] <+SaltySombrero> except when Kiryu himself smokes
[1:15:07] <%Promessa_EX> you can smoke indoors though?
[1:15:08] <+stevenlambchops> Kiryu needs to show them the massive graveyard of people he didn't kill
[1:15:09] <danknugglit> Kiryu is related to nero?

[1:15:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Not here to mess around" 5 sseconds later
[1:15:19] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu still smokes pretty sure by this point LUL
[1:15:22] <tyrianpurplehaze> Yeah, but Kiryu says people can't do that *NOW*
[1:15:22] <切捨御免> Nagumo continues being a fucking dweeb
[1:15:22] <TheNocturnalScotsman> and now you know why essence of smoking is gone
[1:15:23] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat bad reasons and never really got out
[1:15:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> rolling with the crwe
[1:15:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Kiryu smokes, he just polite enough not to do it in public

[1:16:21] <+Spec7re> eeeeyaaaaaaaa
[1:16:27] <st_jimmy456> if i were hanging out with Kiryu and he got into a fight I'd just get out of his way so he didn't accidentally hurt me

[1:16:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> yuta is pulling his weight
[1:17:00] <%Deekman> There's a great story about the giant cones. They were supposed to be regular sized ones but there was an error in scale when they were put in Yakuza 1 and the devs left it because it was funny

[1:18:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What a good word
[1:18:29] <%bread_assassin> Haruka sure knows how to pick them, huh?

[1:18:39] <alrobot2014> gotta add that to the lexicon
[1:18:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is gonna be the ABSOLUTE FIRST person kiryu would kill
[1:18:44] <tyrianpurplehaze> Kiryu's gonna fucking DESTROY Tatsukawa.
[1:18:46] <+stevenlambchops> Even if God gave Haruka the baby, Kiryu would still kill him
[1:18:47] <+Th3SmartAlec> "I can't read"
[1:18:49] <alexandrecau> I mean who else is good looking enough in onomichi to be haruto'S date
[1:18:53] <%AncelDeLambert> sometimes the direct translation is the best one
[1:18:54] <masso101> Yknow, before I saw the shin yakuza trailer, I figured “the end of kiryu’s story” meant he died at the end. Guess not.
[1:18:54] <%alcors_wisdom> also i bet he was the murdered guy you ran into at the very start of the game
[1:18:57] <falconx9k> Gotta find a way to work twinkleshit into the next podcast
[1:18:58] <arkv01> haruka likes them bad bois
[1:18:58] <alrobot2014> kiryu's gonna tear that twinkleshit into omnishambles

[1:19:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Kiryu is her type.
[1:19:06] <%Remery_> Haruka has a fetish
[1:19:06] <higred> Think about playing rage 2?
[1:19:06] <%Omegaanimus> judgement doesn't run in Haruka's blood, nor does it really run that well in her upbringing
[1:19:09] <danknugglit> Twinkleshit sounds like something paige would call you
[1:19:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> @alcors_wisdom Which one? There are many left behind in Kiryu's path

[1:21:58] <$Brother_Coduss> Daigo is a bit of a fuckup
[1:21:59] <InkyDraconian> @Brother_Coduss an inconvenient one
[1:21:59] <%Deekman> The guy who gets kidnapped EVERY GAME
[1:22:02] <masso101> I don’t understand “employee only” restrooms. Like, just let me shit in your establishment Jesus christ
[1:22:04] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@stevenlambchops) (warning)
[1:22:04] <%Omegaanimus> Daigo deserves to go to jail for how he acted in Yakuza 0 ALONE
[1:22:04] <+Landsharks> "Daigo fucks up again" wow where have we heard this before
[1:22:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> Daigo has such a cool name for such a massive dingdong
[1:22:06] <President_valentine> So Majoma and Saejima

[1:22:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> @person181 we needed to see the newspaper tho
[1:22:44] <%Omegaanimus> Daigo is the piece of shit who tells his friends he's paying for everybody at the arcade then calls it off, ONLY to go to the arcade with Kiryu
[1:22:46] <CrowbarFacelift> Daigo has saved Kiryu at least twice because Kiryu always forgets that guns exists

[1:25:41] <%alcors_wisdom> dude we're sitting at a table here
[1:25:46] <$Valdorick> @takiyami Sasaki
[1:25:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Nagumo is such a moron
[1:25:55] <tyrianpurplehaze> Can I just say I love that even in-universe no one has any respect at all for Nagumo?
[1:25:57] <+MisoPhat_> If i was some ignorant fool I would have thought the holes on the table were toilet
[1:25:57] <%Deekman> 4 blocks away. You drove here from Onomichi
[1:26:05] <$SGrim> @Th3SmartAlec mostly the toilet part, but all three seem convoluted at best.
[1:26:12] <alexandrecau> this man needs to die-kiryu
[1:26:16] <@lewdskeletor13> Nagumo is a moron, but he’s our moron

[1:26:45] <%Deekman> it's like looking at a gargoyle on a church roof
[1:26:48] <masso101> I love Nagumo because he’s a cartoon character crowbarred into a very serious soap opera
[1:26:49] <%wolfofsound> @Deekman we're all frozen in the cube
[1:26:51] <ssks123> The face model for Nagumo is a japanese comedian/actor and I keep seeing him when I watch the 24hr no laughing specials and it weirds me out
[1:26:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> Punished Stardust
[1:27:13] <arkv01> *tray

[1:27:54] <%PlainSimpleTailor> They don't want to touch the skin of the filthy customers
[1:27:55] <%alcors_wisdom> its because of the fucking chinese
[1:27:55] <Heyestus> Because touching someone is weird in Japan. It's why they can't have kids too.
[1:27:58] <$SGrim> @alexandrecau I don't really sympathize with the whole desperately needed to shit as character motivation. Just seems like he has poor planning skills.
[1:27:58] <%Kataguro> Oh no, Real Estate

[1:28:00] <gustavozxd> evil Koreans?
[1:28:01] <%Gogogolem> Those damn koreans .
[1:28:04] <%crimsonharvest> Because you don't presume to hand something directly to your customer/superior, they might touch your plebian skin
[1:28:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RACE WAR NOW
[1:28:07] <%zyberion626> As a Korean, BWAHAHAHAHA
[1:28:07] <masso101> Pat does it bother you to think that money is probably dirtier than a toilet bowl? It’s not like you can wash it.
[1:28:09] <%Gogogolem> Coming in with their rap music
[1:28:09] <ShichiNoBushi> It might be similar how you hand food over on a dish.
[1:28:09] <%TheMattman1313> Real Estate Wars? Time to get Nugget
[1:28:09] <%Omegaanimus> Oh shit son, somebody get an electric fan!

[1:28:25] <%shiplord13> The Koreans
[1:28:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Kiryu, you're gonna have to start up your own private Real Estate business one more time"
[1:28:27] <+Landsharks> oh boy everyone is korean again
[1:28:31] <+SuzakuRising> handing someone money is bad luck in Asia
[1:28:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Guess Kiryu's gotta take over the Kamurocho real estate again
[1:28:34] <%Deekman> This game was banned in south Korea 1 day before launch because of the Koreans being bad guys in it
[1:28:37] <person181> like some really bad pals

[1:28:51] <%shiplord13> The Koreans, Tojo, Omi, Chinese, and several other factions
[1:28:51] <masso101> But are they bad enough dudes to rescue the presidents daughter?
[1:28:52] <Rincewind1998> The Jingweon are actually super dangerous
[1:28:53] <ssks123> Yeah, i think that was the impetus for Matsumoto's Documental series @notToph
[1:28:54] <@lewdskeletor13> Time to take on the Five Billionaires again!
[1:29:02] <%Kataguro> Present a briefcase full of cash to the club and buy it
[1:29:04] <%krispen_wa> Jingweon don't fuck around

[1:41:53] <CSeriesJTYPE> this game seems to have stiff animations even compared to 0 and even the reused ones from Kiwami 2

[1:41:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> Holy fuck Pat has a ton of XP
[1:42:01] <+Alopekis> "We'll hold them off, Kiryu. You go get a snack."
[1:42:02] <+HellCopter> Good plan

[1:42:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> Disco fight
[1:42:42] <+HellCopter> All the hosts are fighting
[1:42:43] <person181> yay best boy yuta is here
[1:42:43] <%athuramn> Crim background here, plausible explanation for why police don't show up is because Japan's Yakuza network operates as a known organization in Japan. During emergencies, they provide relief efforts and the police tend to leave them and their areas alone because they manage the crime and poverty in the area by preventing small-time thugs.

[1:47:07] <%THATGUY_789> ITS GROWING
[1:47:07] <tri3dgE027> Is this what Paige meant by the "CUDDLE-ROOM" during that podcast
[1:47:11] <%Promessa_EX> touching is bad
[1:47:12] <Tophat12> Real yakuza actually hate hosts
[1:47:12] <+Th3SmartAlec> Kiryu would be shocked LUL
[1:47:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> KIRYU IS PURE
[1:47:14] <indig0bird> It's jut ladies wanting to have fun with hot guys
[1:47:14] <Darren716> Kiryu is angry at all this evil sex!
[1:47:15] <person181> but the women have no honer in this
[1:47:16] <%Fadedblank247> this is reminding Kiryu of live chat
[1:47:17] <alexandrecau> you shouldn'T be shocked
[1:47:17] <+SaltySombrero> Kiryu only desires pure love.
[1:47:17] <Zombrocom> This is just a brothel
[1:47:18] <%Typhaeon> That dude was Clemps
[1:47:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @THATGUY_789 LUL
[1:47:18] <%Deekman> Pat you're normalizing it
[1:47:19] <Heyestus> Look at the ANIMALS kiss in public
[1:47:19] <mayorrev> ew feet
[1:47:20] <shotgang86> Its a christian night club GODDAMNIT
[1:47:20] <HeadsHeldHigh> Kiryu kink shames
[1:47:20] <%krispen_wa> You'd be crazy to believe women want sex - Korean Vergil
[1:47:21] <$Valdorick> "Women having the power over men!? What power is this!?"
[1:47:21] <currently_confused> more honest than regular host clubs
[1:47:22] <TheNocturnalScotsman> kyriu just hates the guy pat
[1:47:23] <GoldeNOVA> Kiryu is kinkshaming SO HARD Kappa
[1:47:24] <person181> think of the HONOR
[1:47:25] <Darren716> Kiryu must keep the birthrate low!
[1:47:25] <%alcors_wisdom> @person181 naw sex clubs like that are super legal in japan
[1:47:27] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Kiryu's mad because this form of fighting is too slow woopsHyper
[1:47:27] <%Kataguro> Kiryu doesn't like that they turned his Stardust into an M from a T
[1:47:27] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat is this the virgil in this game?
[1:47:29] <Rincewind1998> Reminder that Kiryu helped tutot a literal dominatrix
[1:47:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> @SaltySombrero Yeah. Like with Majima
[1:47:31] <circular7> that would disgust you Pat and you Know it
[1:47:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hes right
[1:47:33] <bigbradish> Kiryu is just confused as to what sex is not angry
[1:47:33] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu disapproves of premarital kissing sugoiGuts2
[1:47:34] <dheng1> Kiryu like my virgin eyes
[1:47:34] <indig0bird> Yeah, Host clubs are just as scummy
[1:47:35] <worldbrand> seriously, it should at least be something worth censoring
[1:47:35] <Ion_Laser> There is no making out in the champagne room!
[1:47:36] <%Dementedpenguin> This is a plot point in the year 2019? NotLikeThis
[1:47:37] <takiyami> Supressing desire, as opposed to Korea
[1:47:38] <fehraf> Kiryu is a pure boy This is degeneracy
[1:47:39] <AirlineFood74> @Luesagna00 Yes, this is Korean Vergil
[1:47:39] <+meatgeneral69> hes not wrong
[1:47:39] <primarch_lupercal> This is some meta shit
[1:47:41] <VanLynx> he did just have to fight a gauntlet to get here
[1:47:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Rincewind1998 He did that to help her DREAM
[1:47:42] <%Deekman> give them the coward omolette
[1:47:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> UNPURE SEX EW
[1:47:44] <gustavozxd> "you have SEX here!?" *angry stare* Kiryu
[1:47:45] <+tigerfang86> BLOCKING DESIRE
[1:47:45] <alexandrecau> korean vergil calling out how stupid host club and cabaret is
[1:47:46] <%zyberion626> Korean Vergil making some sense
[1:47:46] <%Promessa_EX> they are so disgusted
[1:47:47] <tyrianpurplehaze> So... Am I supposed to DISAGREE with this guy? Because he's making all kinds of sense.
[1:47:47] <%shiplord13> Yes Kiryu is a prude
[1:47:50] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat because japan is all about supressing sexuality. the hentai is all just a front
[1:47:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> at least prostitution is honest
[1:47:52] <切捨御免> FLESH OF YOUTH
[1:47:52] <+Shonen_hero> but sex work is the devil's work. Clearly
[1:47:53] <+mcjimbo12> THE FLESH OF YOUTH
[1:47:53] <oAznoUta> the flesh of youth
[1:47:55] <%Kataguro> Why not just open a brothel?
[1:47:55] <+cvp5127> breaking news: sex sells
[1:47:57] <$Valdorick> At least its PG-13 shit, and there's no... H A N D H O L D I N G
[1:47:58] <+Spec7re> WTF
[1:47:59] <+Deano8817> JEEZ
[1:47:59] <HeadsHeldHigh> Well...as long as they don't hold hands
[1:48:02] <ireliaismaiwaifu> muh nihon honor
[1:48:02] <AirlineFood74> WutFace
[1:48:02] <person181> such a wuxa name
[1:48:03] <alrobot2014> flesh of youth
[1:48:04] <juxtest> The good name of Club Stardust is forever tarnished by turning it into a front for organized crime!
[1:48:06] <fearhurst> BREASTS
[1:48:06] <+Deano8817> that was an ACTUAL BLOWJOB
[1:48:08] <%Gogogolem> The FLESH OF YOUTH
[1:48:08] <Darren716> Muh dignity
[1:48:08] <%Promessa_EX> men and woman together!?
[1:48:09] <%snow_bush> PURGE
[1:48:09] <ミュウレ4242> it's one of those bars where topless chicks will drink w/ you and let you grab 'em a little reversed. quite egalitarian.
[1:48:11] <+BoomerTiro> @AngriestPat Maybe that's the point they are trying to make to SONY? We can;t even show the bad guys doing something bad, this is what we can show.
[1:48:12] <+tigerfang86> it's not WRONG
[1:48:15] <falconx9k> Kiryu always thought host clubs were places where you exchange fighting techniques
[1:48:17] <mistspade> is he not just mad that possibly the person haruka had a baby with works in the kinda place while she's in a coma?
[1:48:18] <%THATGUY_789> how very Japan. must hide all intermacy
[1:48:19] <%alcors_wisdom> this speech reminds me of that stupid fucking shadow the hedgehog freindzone meme
[1:48:20] <circular7> touching
[1:48:21] <blue6sub6remnant6> "The flesh of youth." Word choice dude. You've got a good point but still.
[1:48:21] <+Th3SmartAlec> shhhhhh

[1:48:25] <%Kataguro> Weiner contact
[1:48:25] <TheNocturnalScotsman> pat the guy just shoved a guys face into a grill then sent goons after him
[1:48:27] <dheng1> Korean vergil is trying to save japan
[1:48:27] <@lewdskeletor13> People having sex? Enjoying themselves? How dare they!
[1:48:30] <Dr_Mooose> on the line, but not stepping over
[1:48:34] <%krispen_wa> one has lewd impure dicks
[1:48:35] <indig0bird> I feel it would've been ok for "gamers" if it was just female prostitutes but it's bad if "the men are nakid"
[1:48:35] <Heyestus> people don't get their dicks wet in host clubs, right?
[1:48:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> JUDGEMENT NUT
[1:48:36] <HeadsHeldHigh> host and hostess clubs are for people with teasing fetishes

[1:50:22] <%windsoc> be careful pat, easy mode is gonna unlock if you die
[1:50:22] <%NovaKnightmare> why does this guy look like gay vergil
[1:50:23] <tyrianpurplehaze> Is Han the game's way of making up for not having Majima because he's in jail?
[1:50:24] <dheng1> Stop hating kiryu
[1:50:25] <%Omegaanimus> youtube fight videos confirm that
[1:50:26] <+SaltySombrero> "This isn't as pure as chat lines!" -Kiryu
[1:50:26] <%shiplord13> Many times
[1:50:28] <%krispen_wa> I will never be the object of impure thoughts - Kiryu
[1:50:31] <$Valdorick> Yeah, but Majima wanted to fuck him!
[1:50:31] <$Brother_Coduss> BLOOD! BLOOD! BLOOD!
[1:50:32] <+Chronobot> Kiryu loves FAT HOBO PIT
[1:50:32] <+stevenlambchops> Kiryu fought bears in sewer arenas
[1:50:32] <%snow_bush> That guy was fat though.
[1:50:33] <shotgang86> Vergil 1 here is a catfight
[1:50:33] <+Hokepoke> LUL
[1:50:35] <+Landsharks> LUL
[1:50:36] <alexandrecau> no because he is korean
[1:50:36] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Kiryu is too pure for this!
[1:50:37] <%THATGUY_789> he's very confused
[1:50:37] <%Niney_Who> You fought A BEAR
[1:50:38] <alrobot2014> but now kiryu is a tired old man
[1:50:38] <@lewdskeletor13> YOU FIGHT IN PUBLIC KIRYU
[1:50:38] <person181> no but that guy was fat and chill
[1:50:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Didn't you used to go to one of these in the 80's all the time, Kiryu?
[1:50:42] <MeatClackin> Kiryu climbs into the ring carrying a traffic cone.
[1:50:43] <fearhurst> Blast, begone.
[1:50:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh no
[1:50:43] <%spiritofmojave> He also fought in an underwater weird fight-pit
[1:50:43] <Jonny_Uppercut> The shit did I miss!? Why this cute boi club suddenly got a deathmatch ring!?
[1:50:43] <SailingSaturn> And he bet on Women fighpits!
[1:50:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> @shotgang86 Finally what I wanted
[1:50:44] <ShichiNoBushi> He has no idea what "doing it" is.
[1:50:44] <%konekoryugamine> Does he?
[1:50:45] <gekizenbu> Kiryu's shirtlessness is too powerful if used in this horny room
[1:50:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Great. This guy is now dead.
[1:50:48] <HeadsHeldHigh> Playable Yuta?
[1:50:50] <tyrianpurplehaze> Kiryu you have SO LITTLE ground to stand on here I can't fucking believe it.
[1:50:50] <simulationbard> He fought in that death ring for fun
[1:50:51] <%Kataguro> He probably doesn't
[1:50:52] <Maids4lyfe> Yuta's fucking dead
[1:50:52] <+Spec7re> Yuta dude, dont
[1:50:52] <ミュウレ4242> being creeped out because people are doing it is a good enough reason to just leave.
[1:50:54] <stabbityrabbit> Okay, this dude is just a champion of Slaanesh. Gaudy appearance, runs a fight-ring, and the fight-ring doubles as a brothel. All he needs is some needlessly loud music.
[1:50:54] <drefizz> Pog
[1:50:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> He fought criminals underneath a river!
[1:50:54] <shackbox> Yuta is gonna die
[1:50:55] <%konekoryugamine> BOOYAH my laptop still works!!
[1:50:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Kiryu is being a big hypocrite
[1:50:57] <Dr_Mooose> oh god Yuta's so dead
[1:50:57] <Graywolf_the_45th> at least the hookers at purgatory fucked in a different room from the arena
[1:50:57] <gustavozxd> bruh come on Kiryu you've been to your fair share of hidden underground fight clubs
[1:50:57] <%Promessa_EX> yuta you're too skinny

[1:50:59] <person181> i summon yuta in attack mode
[1:50:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> But the point is Kiryu doesn't like the idea of being used
[1:51:02] <%Kataguro> Yuta is raising a lot of Death Flags
[1:51:02] <President_valentine> Bye Yuta
[1:51:03] <b_ikki> yuta stop

[1:51:04] <LandOfTheWay> foolishness, yuta. foolishness.
[1:51:04] <ShichiNoBushi> He's more confused about what's going on than disgusted.

[2:03:32] <danknugglit> At least he wasnt burned
[2:03:33] <Warbot40> and that's RIGHT after the fight, just wait till later
[2:03:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:03:34] <shackbox> He looks worse than the guy who fought FUCKING KIRYU
[2:03:34] <%SrG00SE> oh man i like this guy and i hate that i do
[2:03:34] <k2u5as> WHY didn't he clean up the blood though
[2:03:35] <%krispen_wa> Yuta your face is a watermelon
[2:03:37] <%THATGUY_789> go to the emergency room
[2:03:37] <%Kataguro> Han healed between scenes. Yuta is still a hit from dying
[2:03:37] <+Deano8817> insane honor is the scariest ass honor
[2:03:38] <mankeyfigh> SHAKE
[2:03:39] <%konekoryugamine> Pfftt
[2:03:39] <blue6sub6remnant6> I... I can't help but like Han.
[2:03:40] <HeadsHeldHigh> LUL that dumb fucking picture
[2:03:44] <GoldeNOVA> Shin Majima?
[2:03:51] <%konekoryugamine> STARDUST
[2:03:51] <%Deekman> yeah SEGA really tried hard to get that Korea money
[2:03:51] <%spiritofmojave> also was probably gonna kill Yuta if Kiryu didn't intervene
[2:03:51] <%Remery_> Shake his dick
[2:03:59] <aristomuse> he dead prob
[2:04:01] <%krispen_wa> Because he fucked my daughter
[2:04:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Remery_ He did that when it faded out earlier
[2:04:06] <+mcjimbo12> "oh that dude? totally killed him in the ring, my bad bro, shake on it?"
[2:04:09] <%xGreenflame> Just forget about the way he literally grilled a guys face
[2:04:10] <arkv01> I think this guy was developed to appeal to the Kpop boom in japan
[2:04:12] <+torontototoro> So will Han shoot first?
[2:04:14] <President_valentine> Han is the best
[2:04:15] <%SrG00SE> would be a fun playable character
[2:04:16] <dakuman13> I also like hostess Vergil
[2:04:16] <person181> but he knows
[2:04:17] <Graywolf_the_45th> He jizzled in the wrong girl
[2:04:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he reminds me mo majima
[2:04:25] <GoldeNOVA> He could be Ichiban's rival?
[2:04:25] <+JackMillerTime> but he has honor
[2:04:27] <%shiplord13> Yeah he is crazy
[2:04:31] <%Deekman> I don't think he would've killed him
[2:04:34] <dragoon001914> Yeah no shit
[2:04:34] <blue6sub6remnant6> He's SO CHARISMATIC
[2:04:34] <+Jimboq> i trust him :)
[2:04:35] <+tigerfang86> there's HUGE evil
[2:04:37] <dakuman13> Yeah?
[2:04:37] <%konekoryugamine> OH damn did you see Kiryu's model just freak out there?! XD
[2:04:37] <shackbox> But murder doesn't have to be dishonorable
[2:04:38] <b_ikki> it's a spectrum
[2:04:39] <%spiritofmojave> Good character, no one's debating that
[2:04:41] <Mr_Strut> He has SPORTSUMAANNSHIPPU
[2:04:42] <LixFury> this is yakuza man everyone is evil murderers
[2:04:45] <%Kataguro> He's got enough honor to not be a psycho
[2:04:54] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat kiryu's technically an evil crime person
[2:04:55] <%SrG00SE> he has majima energy
[2:04:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, he's a super big evil murder man, but at least he keeps his promise
[2:05:00] <tri3dgE027> Honorable-Evil (Lawfully Evil), he may be shit. Be he does operate by a strict code
[2:05:05] <%konekoryugamine> Yep
[2:05:09] <%konekoryugamine> THe coolest kind of fucking evil
[2:05:15] <dakuman13> I like Lawful Evil
[2:05:19] <InugamiTheHound> yeah even the last yakuza guy you fought in his underwear was nice
[2:05:20] <takiyami> I think Someya was being genuine, if begrudgingly
[2:05:24] <+starzo0> affably evil is the trope
[2:05:24] <tyrianpurplehaze> Yeah, Someya was sarcastically respectful. Han is ACTUALLY respecting Kiryu.
[2:05:30] <dakuman13> Is Kiryu Neutral Neutral?
[2:05:34] <Prism_Wing> Naw fuck that. Send him to the Hadean realm SwiftRage
[2:05:35] <+Deano8817> Kiryu is neutral good boy
[2:05:35] <alexandrecau> @Kataguro oh no korean vergil is nuts, but he has hisinsane rules
[2:05:35] <InugamiTheHound> What about crazy dude in yakuza 0 who made Majima go crazy
[2:05:36] <+tigerfang86> SECRET CHINESE
[2:05:37] <@commanderclaw> Kiryu is Lawful Neutral in a world of Lawful Evils

[2:05:48] <%shiplord13> Asian Race War
[2:05:48] <falconx9k> Jesus Yuta
[2:05:51] <+miguelrod777> SECRET CHINESE
[2:05:51] <$Brother_Coduss> @dakuman13 Neutral good i'd say, with how much random acts of kindness he does
[2:05:55] <HeadsHeldHigh> yuta go get some fucking ice
[2:05:55] <%MelBrooksKA> I'd say Kiryu is Lawful Neutral
[2:05:55] <shotgang86> Kiryu is more of a chaotic good
[2:05:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dakuman13 Kiryu is lawful neutral leaning True Neutral
[2:05:58] <%SrG00SE> they did a great job fucking his face up
[2:05:58] <+sindrantz> Majima is Chaotic Good

[2:06:06] <%krispen_wa> what a fuccboi
[2:06:06] <%Promessa_EX> Hell yeah
[2:06:11] <President_valentine> He's not wrong
[2:06:12] <+DarkLinkBJ> Kiryu is Lawful Good or Chaotic Good just depends on which side of the law you are on
[2:06:14] <+Deano8817> I'd say kiryu is neutral leaning good normally, but lawful good by default in comparison to the evil as fuck yakuza he's constantly up against
[2:06:16] <Ion_Laser> gotta learn Chinese for The Sploosh
[2:06:17] <+Spec7re> This dude is TERRIFYING

[2:07:43] <+stevenlambchops> Haruka becomes Punished Haruka
[2:07:44] <tyrianpurplehaze> "He probably fathered the baby that is totally not my grandpa and that I big-time stole."
[2:07:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dakuman13 He will after he beats up the deadbeat dad
[2:07:44] <%konekoryugamine> So we've got the Japanese Yakuza, the Korean Mafia, and now we have the Little Asia Chinese mafia.

[2:10:20] <%THATGUY_789> thrown into cogs then

[2:10:26] <person181> yutas eys is magic
[2:10:28] <%Laecerelius> He ate some food
[2:10:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They had some Stamina X
[2:10:29] <%Deekman> nah that club just has bad lighting
[2:10:29] <bigbradish> Has Kiryu ever canonically murdered someone?
[2:10:31] <%Laecerelius> It's fine
[2:10:35] <Futurecity10> Japanese have a very good Healing factor
[2:10:36] <President_valentine> Nope
[2:10:36] <person181> yuta is luck to still have 2 eyes
[2:10:37] <+JackMillerTime> so he cant hit hard but he can take a beating
[2:10:37] <RupanSen> He just drank a Stamina X
[2:10:38] <%Fadedblank247> everyone heals fast in these games
[2:10:38] <+tigerfang86> no murder EVER
[2:10:39] <@commanderclaw> Kiryu will gouge his eyes out
[2:10:39] <mleebee> Thank you 😊
[2:10:39] <aristomuse> kiryu so angery
[2:10:40] <alexandrecau> Now you can sidequest
[2:10:43] <InugamiTheHound> @bigbradish no
[2:10:43] <%korth367> wiped most of it off
[2:10:45] <tri3dgE027> Hopefully Yakuza 7, Kiryu becomes the new MR. SHAKEDOWN
[2:10:46] <@commanderclaw> But NOT kill him
[2:10:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This must be the work of an enemy 「Car」
[2:10:52] <%Fadedblank247> Kiryu took that pipe from Kuze and was fine
[2:10:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Now that those two are gone, time for some silly side stories.
[2:10:55] <%VanaSkiller> Hit and Runs should now just be called CAR ATTACKS
[2:10:55] <%alcors_wisdom> i was looking at paige being drunk on twitter what did i just miss

[2:10:59] <shotgang86> No sidemissions?
[2:11:04] <%discordlord45> discordlord45 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:11:04] <Zombrocom> Kiryu blew up a helicopter one time, pretty sure they dead
[2:11:06] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu should kill the guy chariot-style by attaching them to a back of a car then dragging them to death
[2:11:13] <+stevenlambchops> The closest he got was dragging some guy in front of him to be a human shield but that's a can of worms among the Yakuza fanbase

[2:11:51] <+Blargimazombie> Shut up moobot
[2:11:52] <%snow_bush> Like, Kiryu could beat most fighting game characters.
[2:11:58] <+Deano8817> kiryu only put 10% of his power into that punch
[2:12:00] <+stevenlambchops> Kiryu is an echo fighter for God

[2:12:29] <televisedrevolting> @moulesfritz I saw that AkwardZombie comic.
[2:12:32] <%NWR_James> An Elegant Time
[2:12:37] <dakuman13> murder makes one hungry
[2:12:38] <fearhurst> Kiryu needs Magnesium Cotrate

[2:12:51] <%Promessa_EX> go to the otoire
[2:13:02] <%snow_bush> God damn, that's a lot of Coffee
[2:13:04] <@commanderclaw> I like the Crab place in Kiwami 2
[2:13:06] <%spiritofmojave> one of the restaurants in this should have a Kiryu-special by now
[2:13:08] <tyrianpurplehaze> Kiryu: Man, not-murdering people really works up the appetite.
[2:13:11] <%alcors_wisdom> @doc_ock_rokc kiryu's bowels are 100% effeceint every part of the food is converted into dragon energy
[2:13:15] <arkv01> @AngriestPat how ya feel about saizeriya family restaurant chain
[2:13:18] <alrobot2014> kiryu ate more there than i'd eat in 2 days
[2:13:19] <RupanSen> "But sir, our supplies won't be enough for the other customers"
[2:13:24] <falconx9k> Woah
[2:13:28] <%Promessa_EX> Nyan Nyan from macross frontier
[2:13:28] <fearhurst> How does kiryu maintain his body when he doesnt exercise
[2:13:31] <%krispen_wa> Karaoke bar?
[2:13:39] <alexandrecau> @RupanSen then I'll kill them
[2:13:42] <+tigerfang86> that'd be nuts
[2:13:43] <SilverFaustX> D:
[2:13:43] <shotgang86> man I hope Kiryu don't get a stomache after all that
[2:13:45] <%Laecerelius> Makes sense
[2:13:46] <+Deano8817> probably for the best for your sanity
[2:13:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Coward Kappa
[2:13:48] <Mr_Strut> Coward!
[2:13:51] <takiyami> That would be nuts
[2:13:53] <dakuman13> Sounds I dunno, realistic?
[2:13:55] <gustavozxd> that's beyond insane in any Yakuza game LUL
[2:13:56] <falconx9k> Fair
[2:13:58] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat did you like any of place you ate at in Onomichi?
[2:13:58] <+Raidou24> Are you gonna do Amon on stream?
[2:14:00] <%Archphronimos> He runs everywhere and fights constantly... of course he's in shape
[2:14:02] <%spiritofmojave> Atleast pick the critical fun ones on here
[2:14:02] <LandOfTheWay> understandable
[2:14:02] <+Hotironclad> that's fair
[2:14:05] <+mcjimbo12> we'd be here for a year if you went for everything so yeah makes sense
[2:14:05] <VanLynx> No Amon?
[2:14:08] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Play Kiwami 2 instead of 100%
[2:14:08] <falconx9k> That one lady scream
[2:14:09] <+HellCopter> @AngriestPat There aren't a ton of sidequests in this one
[2:14:11] <Futurecity10> Way to cheat us out of another Amon fight
[2:14:12] <%Laecerelius> You've pretty much built yourself up by now anyway
[2:14:12] <@commanderclaw> Count yourself lucky, at least this game doesn't have the Hostess minigame
[2:14:14] <wdga> kyaaaa
[2:14:14] <AirlineFood74> @spiritofmojave What dis guy said
[2:14:14] <+bigquaff> KYAAAA
[2:14:14] <%sjay449> You streaming Judgement at launch @AngriestPat
[2:14:17] <JamvaanPS4> Don't want to Yakuzi out before Judgement I take it?
[2:14:19] <QaizerArt> @AngriestPat you hate him so much but pls do pocket circuit
[2:14:22] <+stevenlambchops> Kiryu exhausts all excess calories into angry Kiryu energy
[2:14:22] <+Deano8817> amon's decently easy to unlock in 6
[2:14:30] <%Deekman> Amon is all substories complete. It's not gonna happen
[2:14:30] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat are you still going to stream skyrim?
[2:14:34] <%NWR_James> Our stupid boy and his stupid shirt
[2:14:37] <person181> nagumo missed a SUPER cool fight
[2:14:40] <%Ragin_Asian06> The quality improvements from 0 K & K2 and now 6 are astounding
[2:14:41] <QaizerArt> OH SHIT
[2:14:43] <takiyami> Amon is also the most bullshit in this one
[2:14:44] <arkv01> yeah, we killed pocket fighers kid!
[2:14:48] <+tigerfang86> YEYEYEYE
[2:14:48] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat kiryu being a small fish made sense in the little town, but now that's he's in kamurocho shouldn't he be HUGE DEAL
[2:14:48] <+kabuhiro> funny thing, what does the yakuza, triads, and korean mafia have in common? they all like to speak in country side dialect/accent
[2:14:49] <mr_ESB> Dammit Nagumo
[2:14:50] <Rincewind1998> Hey Pat, how do you think the combat in this game/Kiwami2 compare to 0?

[2:15:03] <%Laecerelius> Pocket Fighter's party of Kiryu's gang!
[2:15:03] <%krispen_wa> Nagumo you fucking loser
[2:15:04] <%spiritofmojave> Nagumo is just a dumber Shinji from 1
[2:15:05] <%Ganerumo> I still feel Korean McEvilface is more like Opposite Majima; color scheme is complementary to Goro, personality is opposite (cold outside/super angry inside), and he's got that shirtless jacket thing going
[2:15:06] <%alcors_wisdom> he went to soap land
[2:15:08] <Ion_Laser> "got lost"
[2:15:09] <person181> like good old nishki
[2:15:10] <%shiplord13> I assumed he was murdered
[2:15:10] <falconx9k> The Jingweon guys just smelled that good
[2:15:13] <+stevenlambchops> He got the succ
[2:15:14] <aristomuse> why is Nagumo so dumb
[2:15:17] <Enryuan> Was the father reaveled?
[2:15:23] <person181> no
[2:15:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pocket circuit sounds like a euphemism for punching your hog.
[2:15:28] <%krispen_wa> Nagumo fucks?

[2:15:33] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat u gonna bully any of the New Japan guys?
[2:15:36] <%NWR_James> Nagumo got a happy ending. Yuta got a bad end
[2:15:37] <tyrianpurplehaze> @krispen_wa Only when he pays for it.
[2:15:39] <GundamF91> Nagumo is my favorite in this game
[2:15:40] <VanLynx> hit him
[2:15:41] <indig0bird> "Women must be pure but I can fuck all the prostitutes I want!"
[2:15:45] <+Hotironclad> God Nagumo is such a tool
[2:15:46] <%shiplord13> Yuta got his ass kicked
[2:15:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> OH
[2:15:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> ECCHI
[2:15:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> He just found out his favorite girl isn't pure pat
[2:15:57] <%alcors_wisdom> man what a piece of shit how the fuck is he the head of the family
[2:15:59] <sperium3000> "Kiyo-chan has to be pure and untouched... BUT I'M A GUY SO I CAN FUCK ALL I WANT HAHAHAHAAH"
[2:16:00] <@commanderclaw> "I fucked a hooker" Also "How dare that woman be divorced!"
[2:16:01] <televisedrevolting> @rumtumtugnutz You mean playing a little five-on-one?
[2:16:05] <$Brother_Coduss> this man is an idiot
[2:16:06] <Rincewind1998> This man has a shit-eating grin to rival Jetstream Sam
[2:16:08] <+Hokepoke> REALLY
[2:16:08] <sperium3000> Fuck Nagumo with a rusty knife
[2:16:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Man, Japan is fucked" - Japan
[2:16:11] <+MisterRockett> So you did "Oh my god! She's DIVORCED?!" last week, huh?
[2:16:14] <InugamiTheHound> well his waif is divorced and had a kid with a yakuza as well.
[2:16:14] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat He is aware Yuta nearly shit himself this night and nearly got his asskicked to death.
[2:16:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Brother_Coduss what gave it away
[2:16:20] <alexandrecau> it wasn't women be pure it was his childhood crush
[2:16:20] <%Gogogolem> Yutas stupid but i like him
[2:16:21] <@lewdskeletor13> So he’ll get mad that his waifu was married but is fine with fucking hookers?
[2:16:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> I'll take your word for that Pat
[2:16:28] <QaizerArt> i'm genuinely in disbelief that pat got my name right
[2:16:29] <%alcors_wisdom> yeah you have thats where the tax collectors are in 1
[2:16:32] <tyrianpurplehaze> I'll try to be super-fair to Nagumo: He was a total bitch about Kiyomi, but he never blamed or got mad at HER.
[2:16:33] <%krispen_wa> Yuta deserves better than having Nagumo as his best friend
[2:16:33] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat what kind of building was it
[2:16:34] <+sixcubit> "How DARE he have men be sex workers" "Oh hey Kiryu i fucked some whores on the way here"

[2:19:21] <%MelBrooksKA> @InugamiTheHound Who framed Roger Kiryu
[2:19:21] <MoulesFritz> so now that kiryuu is back in kamurocho, shouldn't he be a HUGE DEAL?

[2:19:32] <+JackMillerTime> thank god for japanese columbo
[2:19:32] <%snow_bush> @doc_ock_rokc But that would require Kiryu to kill.
[2:19:33] <%krispen_wa> SOUKA
[2:19:33] <tyrianpurplehaze> @AngriestPat Kiryu's gotten so good at having other people kill his enemies that it happens before he even MEETS THEM.
[2:19:34] <person181> the only cop we can trust
[2:19:35] <shackbox> Date doin good work
[2:19:36] <simulationbard> Date saves the day again
[2:19:37] <%Deekman> Remember when he quit the force for 4 years to become a reporter
[2:19:37] <SilverFaustX> it means black child
[2:19:38] <%snow_bush> Big not framed.
[2:19:40] <%spiritofmojave> Local DILF SAVES KAMUROCHO
[2:19:40] <%Laecerelius> Best boy Date!
[2:19:41] <+CourageTheCat> CYKA
[2:19:42] <+PeaceCentennial> yeah kiryu can talk to the police now without getting immediately arrested
[2:19:43] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Kiryu was almost framed for murder again
[2:19:44] <sperium3000> "Did someone ask for a competent cop?"
[2:19:47] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat Date is at it's most useful in this game it's crazy, almost a real cop
[2:19:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> ha
[2:19:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> SUSPECT
[2:19:51] <person181> look at this guy we don't like
[2:19:54] <%krispen_wa> I mean, he's right
[2:19:54] <falconx9k> Date's the best
[2:19:57] <@commanderclaw> Prove it bitch
[2:19:57] <%Niney_Who> But Kiryu NEVER KILLS
[2:19:59] <+Spec7re> Piss off Honjo
[2:20:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I looked away for a moment and thought you said Dante. Date's great tho
[2:20:01] <+Th3SmartAlec> Kiryu, known super murderer
[2:20:02] <tri3dgE027> Just noticed...they never blink...
[2:20:03] <person181> chill the fuck out honjo
[2:20:03] <%TheMattman1313> BACK TO PRISON
[2:20:04] <%alcors_wisdom> you know one big ass plot hole here is that they never actually ran a DNA test on the baby
[2:20:05] <+miguelrod777> he's not wrong
[2:20:08] <arkv01> man am I glad date has PULL in the department now
[2:20:09] <AirlineFood74> Piss off Johto
[2:20:12] <President_valentine> People who say Majima is Kiryu best friend are dumb its obviously Date
[2:20:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ha a sleazy fuck fucked your babu girl kiryu
[2:20:18] <%Deekman> @tri3dgE027 yep never blink
[2:20:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Because he probably is.
[2:20:23] <alexandrecau> @alcors_wisdom they did
[2:20:23] <%VanaSkiller> wouldn't doubt it
[2:20:24] <aristomuse> cops are always in on it
[2:20:27] <+bigquaff> he's super in it
[2:20:28] <+cgmerryo> @tri3dgE027 not a single blink
[2:20:31] <+Hotironclad> they're always in on it
[2:20:31] <sperium3000> I love how there's a Little Asia in Kamurocho, as if Japan was not in Asia
[2:20:32] <tri3dgE027> And there they go, Date immediately blinked
[2:20:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wait, so it's confirmed Tatsukawa's dead?
[2:20:35] <%alcors_wisdom> @alexandrecau nooooo they didnt they said they didnt need to
[2:20:37] <%snow_bush> Isn't like one cop a game involved in the plan?
[2:20:37] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s in on it cause he’s not nice to Kiryu
[2:20:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hell, I think that Tojo guy is probably a secret Triad.
[2:20:38] <indig0bird> I don't think she was dating him
[2:20:39] <MoulesFritz> so now that kiryuu is back in kamurocho, shouldn't he be a HUGE DEAL??
[2:20:39] <person181> i mean there's only one cop we can trust
[2:20:40] <tri3dgE027> Crazy-Talk
[2:20:46] <indig0bird> Both must had been killed a while ago
[2:20:48] <MoulesFritz> the fucking dragon of dojima is home
[2:20:48] <shackbox> "But kiryu will do all the work for us"
[2:20:50] <+Th3SmartAlec> @President_valentine Date is his platonic best friend. Majima on the other hand...
[2:20:51] <%Laecerelius> Bitch, Kiryu will solve this for us!
[2:20:58] <%Niney_Who> FUCK OFF
[2:20:59] <%dattorren64> 99% conviction rate let's go
[2:21:00] <AirlineFood74> NARC
[2:21:02] <%spiritofmojave> This guy needs to piss right off
[2:21:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> COLLUSION
[2:21:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Kiryu would probably make a pretty kickass detective honestly
[2:21:07] <alexandrecau> @alcors_wisdom no they did but they know the kid is haruka, the result just has yet to come
[2:21:09] <$SGrim> @sperium3000 many Japanese don't consider japan part of asia. It's like British and being european. woopsADD
[2:21:12] <Rincewind1998> Date looks younger in 6 than he does in 4
[2:21:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> mmm
[2:21:22] <CurrySauseBandit> Yet, he's still not fired.
[2:21:24] <simulationbard> Kiryu would never have anything to do with the yakuza
[2:21:32] <%krispen_wa> SIDEQUEST TIME
[2:21:33] <indig0bird> I think there's not a single cop who hasn't taken bribes from Yakuza
[2:21:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> unless date makes it like he is doing further interviews
[2:21:35] <falconx9k> Kiryu foiled by tape
[2:21:37] <%Laecerelius> FREEDOM!
[2:21:37] <+miguelrod777> dtaes also old and tired what does he care

[2:21:41] <AirlineFood74> LUL
[2:21:41] <ミュウレ4242> he was fired at first, but rehired years later.
[2:21:41] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Isn't that what happens to everyone who gets involved with Kiryu?

[2:21:46] <+Taglog7> Were free now
[2:21:46] <sperium3000> Did Date get fired from being a cop for YEARS because of Kiryu?
[2:21:46] <CrowbarFacelift> neko
[2:21:47] <tyrianpurplehaze> Japan is Asia's Great Britain: Just 'cause they're an island they think they're completely different and not a part of the continent.

[2:42:19] <%alcors_wisdom> @NWR_James it tastes like a pinetree tho
[2:42:20] <a_mad_dragon> @AngriestPat you need to get a wireless mic attached to elmo's collar

[2:43:04] <%VioletHeart> Indoor cats don't really need them so.
[2:43:04] <+PeaceCentennial> It feels really good but I really don't like what they did to throws.
[2:43:05] <dakuman13> I guess that makes sense in Elmo's case
[2:43:10] <+PeaceCentennial> Where there's one throw
[2:43:15] <+Tarkara> is he chipped?
[2:43:16] <@lewdskeletor13> You only need a collar for a cat if they’re an outdoor cat really
[2:43:16] <%Remery_> too dumb for collar
[2:43:18] <InugamiTheHound> @kujofire990 oh I thought ichigo meant strawberry

[2:55:21] <%spiritofmojave> Letting people off for attempted bombings is HONORABLE
[2:55:22] <%Laecerelius> Kiryu defeated terrorism!
[2:55:22] <%whiskey_wolfe_> Speaking as a Northern Irishman, I don't get what you're all so surprised about
[2:55:27] <Vordox> If someone died, then maybe Kiryu would be more punishing, but Kiryu knows that things can be rebuilt after all
[2:55:29] <+JackMillerTime> nah its fine
[2:55:29] <outlawmap> Ha
[2:55:34] <SilverFaustX> terrorism just say no
[2:55:37] <mayorrev> how tall is kiryu?
[2:55:37] <%TheMattman1313> This is why your daughter left you and got knocked up Kiryu, for shit like this

[2:55:39] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 55m.
[2:55:41] <tank7013> Japan seems to really love the trope of "Well nobody got hurt so I guess it's fine"
[2:55:41] <+MisoPhat_> forgiving bad guys will always defeat them
[2:55:43] <dakuman13> It's what Jesus woulda done
[2:55:48] <+JackMillerTime> if someone died it would be a problem
[2:55:49] <Snarksmith> all that meat

[3:12:57] <+BoomerTiro> Why are V and nero posing as Final Fantasy villains in wacky yakuza land?
[3:12:57] <arkv01> t he problem is these guys are actually voiced by their wrestling models and they SUCK at voice acting
[3:12:58] <%joyoustechnoshrine> baby feet...

[3:13:13] <Rincewind1998> Can you imagine if Kiryu just grabbed one of those guy and hucked him out the window?
[3:13:13] <caol2017> Technically he said it's "Ten times bigger", twice. It works out to 100x if you read it right
[3:13:15] <$Big_King_Coconut> if I pet my cat's feets he'll rip my hand off
[3:13:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> I can't believe how many pro wrestlers are in this game. But wrestling is ENORMOUS in Japan so it makes sense.

[3:13:57] <%Shonen_hero> and then he killed them. Killed them all
[3:14:00] <%Shonen_hero> just as he said
[3:14:00] <%castcode> Those poor shops
[3:14:01] <alrobot2014> does the millenium tower have kiryu insurance?
[3:14:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Big property damage
[3:14:03] <JamvaanPS4> How many times have you busted all of these windows out man?
[3:14:08] <%Ilpala> Sorry bout this guys, I got done taping a really dumb shoot with these assholes, one of 'em couldn't do math real well, just gotta blow off some steam
[3:14:08] <%Omegaanimus> Isn't Okada married to a famous voice actress?
[3:14:09] <Ion_Laser> @Fear_Ranjer Yeah that was Kojima, Tenzan, and Okada from New Japan Pro Wrestling
[3:14:10] <%spiritofmojave> You are now banned from Millennium Tower

[3:14:37] <%Niney_Who> The entire snake is a foot
[3:14:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> @krispen_wa Tanahashi is arguably the Japanese John Cena... Rainmaker is more like Randy Orton without the wasted potential.
[3:14:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> A snake is basically one big foot
[3:14:46] <gustavozxd> after all those goddamn final bosses

[3:15:01] <+BoomerTiro> @Valentinius_Anodyne How can you say something so controversial yet so brave?
[3:15:02] <dakuman13> Sure but you can beat up everyone in the Millennium Tower
[3:15:07] <ミュウレ4242> you will never hug a lion.
[3:15:07] <+Sulfur_Boride> TBF, Nishiki's the one who blew up the Millenium Tower, not Kiryu, and you can't really ban a dead guy.

[3:15:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> There are 3 cats don't forget the Tsundere
[3:15:37] <el_phthalo> I'd say that Okada is more like what Vince wants Roman Reigns to be.
[3:15:38] <nepwar> i got a bunch of stray cats that dont care what i do to them as long as i give them dog food
[3:15:39] <alexandrecau> @Sulfur_Boride kiryu took the blame for that too
[3:15:43] <pmtriox> no pet, no pet ever
[3:15:44] <Blank9> the big baby is also special ed giant maine coon

[3:16:35] <+PeaceCentennial> yuta's friend just fucking died
[3:16:36] <Macmo696> Really???
[3:16:36] <Darren716> Nekros4442 Check his twitter
[3:16:38] <shackbox> date takes every chance to remind us that he fucks
[3:16:41] <%onlystrykerfan> That guy slays the puss
[3:16:44] <%Kataguro> Not even a black eye
[3:16:45] <%spiritofmojave> @theobble Original Mama died jermaPluto
[3:16:46] <President_valentine> @theobble different character
[3:16:48] <+PeaceCentennial> y'ass
[3:16:50] <mankeyfigh> Guys got his ass
[3:16:51] <arkv01> lmao zero respect for nagumo
[3:16:52] <shackbox> just absolutely destroys the sex
[3:16:55] <InugamiTheHound> so both bar mamas are married(or at least one is still married unlike the other one)
[3:16:55] <theobble> oh FeelsBadMan
[3:17:10] <Snarksmith> The weird dude did clean up nice enough though
[3:17:11] <President_valentine> @theobble Reina died in 1/kiwami
[3:17:14] <切捨御免> I appreciate that nagumo is acknowledged to be a total shit captain by his goons
[3:17:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Well, according to Mister Evil he was working for them. Trustworthy source that guy.
[3:17:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Now they're building Kota Ibushi to be the new Ace and it's frankly well deserved.
[3:17:30] <arkv01> nagumos a baka of gold
[3:17:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> ALTHOUGH
[3:17:42] <+wvuboii> I'm super late bet hey Yall
[3:17:44] <+PeaceCentennial> oh so tatsukawa is completely still alive
[3:17:49] <+PeaceCentennial> that's a body double
[3:17:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ibushi was in a super dumb Kaiju movie.
[3:17:56] <+PeaceCentennial> because that's dumb
[3:17:59] <shackbox> that'd be fair
[3:18:00] <%spiritofmojave> That'd make a lot of sense
[3:18:01] <%Omegaanimus> Ibushi is both an amazing athlete and a very pretty and yet still manly man
[3:18:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> That would make so much sense
[3:18:08] <person181> makes sense to me
[3:18:09] <+RaziWraith> That would make sense LUL
[3:18:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That sounds dumb enough to be true.
[3:18:09] <dakuman13> seems legit
[3:18:10] <%Omegaanimus> qualities that take someone far in Japan
[3:18:18] <+BubbleyBloos> On Haruka's orders also
[3:18:20] <Zombrocom> Either Tatsukawa is not dead, or is not the dad
[3:18:20] <gustavozxd> that's some Jhon Wick shit LUL
[3:18:20] <%Kataguro> The Dragon of Dojima, the walking nuke
[3:18:21] <shackbox> "why would you bring kiryu here? now we're all gonna get the shit kicked out of us"
[3:18:21] <Warbot40> John Wick situation
[3:18:23] <+JackMillerTime> it was a complete accident but he fucked up
[3:18:23] <InugamiTheHound> why kill her? He could have left her alone and raise the kid by herself
[3:18:24] <alwayspronking> ah fuck, ah jeex LUL
[3:18:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> You did what to WHO! WHY?! OH GOD!
[3:18:26] <k2u5as> John Wick 4
[3:18:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:18:26] <Dr_Mooose> Kiryu the John Wick of this world
[3:18:27] <President_valentine> Getting Kiryu involved should be punishinable by death
[3:18:27] <arkv01> you ran over who? Death is coming you say?
[3:18:27] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Pat d'o you dream in first or third person?
[3:18:29] <+JackMillerTime> i love that idea
[3:18:30] <RupanSen> Basically John Wick 1
[3:18:30] <shackbox> "he's coming HERE?"
[3:18:32] <Ion_Laser> John Wick :D
[3:18:33] <televisedrevolting> "You killed John Wick's dog?"
[3:18:34] <%blaccbird914> if he did he brought the thunder down on the city
[3:18:34] <%Das_Bass> you did WHAT
[3:18:35] <AirlineFood74> Proper John Wick stuff
[3:18:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Omegaanimus His match with Naito for the Intercontinental championship was pretty great.
[3:18:37] <rubbergumi> barley alive
[3:18:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Sounds like a sound theory
[3:18:39] <InkyDraconian> OH GOD OH FUCK
[3:18:40] <ObsidianDragon86> Exactly John Wick
[3:18:42] <FenixSeraph> Tatsukawa fucked up! Tatsukawa fucked up! Tatsukawa fucked up now!
[3:18:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I"m still wondering if the child is actually hers. Did she steal it from some BIG EVIL?
[3:18:46] <indig0bird> I feel that's how a Kiryu fan would think lol
[3:18:46] <@commanderclaw> Kiryu Kazuma, the Boogeyman
[3:18:47] <%joyoustechnoshrine> death in his pale white suit?
[3:18:47] <+RAGING_1NF3RNO> John wick, basically.
[3:18:48] <%Faustgesicht> is Kiryu japanese John Wick?
[3:18:49] <%spiritofmojave> I mean Triads, Jing-weu, and all the clans of the Yakuzies would by now know 'hey don't fuck this badly with Kiryu"
[3:18:50] <arkv01> kiryus revenge fuck quest
[3:18:54] <+griffball13> he stole john wicks car sire and killed his dog @AngriestPat
[3:18:55] <+PeaceCentennial> @AngriestPat every criminal organization in Kamurocho has a "Kiryu Alarm" that they pull when he's in town
[3:18:55] <+Spec7re> John wick is basically kiryu with guns
[3:18:57] <%wolfofsound> he's the guy you send to kill the fucking boogeyman @commanderclaw
[3:18:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> John wick but with FISTS
[3:18:58] <+BoomerTiro> 6 games? 9 games? How many games of Kiryu completely destroying an entire criminal underworld and multiple crime organizations per game now?
[3:18:58] <Ominnous> John Wick's dog was going to have my baby and I couldn't have that
[3:19:01] <pmtriox> if that was the case, why wouldn't they get in front of that and go "look we killed the guy, we didn't know, it's all good"
[3:19:02] <TheBlackSpaceLive> he stole john wicks car sir....and killed his dog.
[3:19:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> No. Kiryu isn;t John Wick. His dog is still alive.
[3:19:12] <%Gogogolem> @angriestpat you punched supermans wife?
[3:19:12] <%Kataguro> Beat Takeshi
[3:19:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheBlackSpaceLive oh.....
[3:19:20] <arkv01> yeah... I know Beat Hirose
[3:19:23] <ObsidianDragon86> Stole John Wicks car and used it to run Haruka over
[3:19:26] <切捨御免> Nagumo...
[3:19:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "Now Kiryu's going to come after the rest of us and he'll go totally sickhouse on our asses!"
[3:19:27] <Zombrocom> Sandbagged
[3:19:27] <%Omegaanimus> It isn't actually Haruka's kid, it's actualy the son of this guy she really liked and was shouldering all of the responsibility of
[3:19:29] <arkv01> *Beato
[3:19:31] <ObsidianDragon86> Boom!@ Double fucked
[3:19:35] <caol2017> Why does date look younger than kiwami 1
[3:19:37] <+PeaceCentennial> Hmm?
[3:19:39] <%Divryne> RUH ROH.
[3:19:40] <Zepik> so is haruka dead?
[3:19:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> God that scene solidifies how scary John Wick is
[3:19:43] <+PeaceCentennial> That's a problem
[3:19:46] <+Chronobot> AGAIN
[3:19:50] <Maids4lyfe> that's a big problem
[3:19:50] <+PeaceCentennial> Oh man the Tojo Clan wants to die again
[3:19:50] <%Kataguro> Did they have Chinese or Korean accents?
[3:19:53] <gustavozxd> @obsidiandragon86 John Wick Kiryu team up PogChamp

[3:20:02] <arkv01> tojo clan is like a fucking phoenix
[3:20:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Haruto has lineage.
[3:20:05] <arkv01> keeps rising from the ashes
[3:20:08] <%Nobrev> Is kiryu gonna have to beat down the ENTIRE TOJO CLAN again
[3:20:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @gustavozxd John wick can't kill
[3:20:08] <Futurecity10> What if haruka stole another 1 billion yen
[3:20:11] <ObsidianDragon86> @gustavozxd Awww Yis!
[3:20:11] <Ultra_Pancake> Has Kiryu ever had sex even one time? Has Haruka had sex before Kiryu?
[3:20:12] <+PeaceCentennial> This is why it sucks when Majima is out of town
[3:20:15] <+PeaceCentennial> this happened in 4 too
[3:20:23] <arkv01> @Ultra_Pancake well we know hes rubbed off to phone sex before
[3:20:28] <TheBlackSpaceLive> @doc_ock_rokc, :D
[3:20:33] <%spiritofmojave> @Futurecity10 Imagine if there were two of those stupid pendants LUL
[3:20:36] <alrobot2014> isn't majima in prison rn
[3:20:37] <Maids4lyfe> this wouldn't have happened if Majima was still around
[3:20:40] <%Omegaanimus> Didn't the interview say that it isn't officially canon that Kiryu is a virgin???
[3:20:44] <President_valentine> He's still being hunted
[3:20:46] <tank7013> @Ultra_Pancake Sub stories say yes, one dev says no
[3:20:50] <gustavozxd> I'm pretty sure Kiryu has sex in 2
[3:20:54] <tyrianpurplehaze> @Ultra_Pancake Pretty sure he could take girls to hotels in 0 sidequests.
[3:20:58] <Maids4lyfe> Haruka is adopted anyways
[3:20:59] <HeadsHeldHigh> menacing Ed
[3:20:59] <+PeaceCentennial> I need to find his friends, Edd and Eddy
[3:21:00] <tyrianpurplehaze> sidquests in 0
[3:21:05] <person181> ya'll remember ed
[3:21:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Maids4lyfe This would happen but majima would be the one holding the guy so kiryu can punch him
[3:21:10] <切捨御免> majima's probably doing rad prison shit with saejima
[3:21:10] <%wolfofsound> Kiryu is a pure old man who just loves to help and kill people with his fists
[3:21:12] <alexandrecau> @Omegaanimus Kiryou likely had sex with kaoru but she disappeared
[3:21:14] <arkv01> @tyrianpurplehaze they just played UNO man
[3:21:19] <%Nobrev> @tank7013 there are also substories that suggest kiryu isn't opposed to chasing skirts
[3:21:19] <therealtacopancakes> !uptime
[3:21:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 21m.
[3:21:23] <Maids4lyfe> @doc_ock_rokc shit you're right LUL
[3:21:27] <%Omegaanimus> we all know Kiryu did it with that girl who worked at Sega in 0
[3:21:29] <+PeaceCentennial> when is Kaoru going to come back
[3:21:32] <el_phthalo> Elmo must think Pat's arm is a tuft of his fur.
[3:21:32] <+PeaceCentennial> she's so fucking cool
[3:21:36] <President_valentine> never
[3:21:37] <Rincewind1998> Wasn't it pretty strongly implied that Kiryu and Kaoru had sex in 2?
[3:21:45] <arkv01> only way kaorus coming back is with kiryus baby
[3:21:49] <%rosemon5001> one day elmo will do an your allready dead look and we wont see it comin
[3:21:51] <Blank9> aggressive kissing
[3:21:56] <dashmatt> Lookin' good pat, hi chat!
[3:22:01] <shackbox> "you're too slow date!"
[3:22:03] <%Omegaanimus> the virgin thing isn't official canon, more of a developer head canon thing
[3:22:04] <+Sulfur_Boride> Wait, I missed Tatsukawa dying. Did he die super hard?
[3:22:05] <shackbox> wrong game
[3:22:06] <+PeaceCentennial> haruto is kiryu and kaoru's baby confirmed
[3:22:11] <+PeaceCentennial> a 3-4 year gestation period
[3:22:18] <+PeaceCentennial> sorry
[3:22:20] <+PeaceCentennial> 7 year
[3:22:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sulfur_Boride died before we got there
[3:22:23] <Blank9> tatsukawa was found dead super bad in a hotel
[3:22:28] <%spiritofmojave> Imagine Kaoru having a son/daughter with Kiryu and them being in Judge Eyes somehow
[3:22:33] <shackbox> Tatsu got his throat slit and stabbed hella bad
[3:22:33] <Rincewind1998> @Sulfur_Boride absolutely, one of the most uncomfortable corpses ever in a game
[3:22:48] <President_valentine> Look for hoboman again
[3:22:53] <+PeaceCentennial> go find the best new character introduced in 4
[3:22:58] <+PeaceCentennial> Akiyama is the best
[3:22:59] <arkv01> @spiritofmojave oh fuck I can totally see us starting with ichiban but then swerve to the kiryus son ala mgs2 tanker
[3:23:01] <satsumavo> Go to the sewers meet the big rat who makes all the rules
[3:23:03] <+PeaceCentennial> Kick styles
[3:23:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> If Judge eyes don't have Kiryu as a cameo then I will burn this place to the GROUND/s
[3:23:06] <alexandrecau> @Sulfur_Boride killed him and his girlfriend
[3:23:08] <ZZCooldown> @AngriestPat is the mistery of who runned over haruka a ripoff of who runned over stone cold?
[3:23:09] <ShichiNoBushi> Sewer level!
[3:23:12] <Vordox> @PeaceCentennial Best singing voice
[3:23:17] <falconx9k> Into the poop village
[3:23:19] <AirlineFood74> Watch out for guys on bikes, kiryu
[3:23:22] <+Sulfur_Boride> Well shit...
[3:23:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I dunno Kiryu, you get attacked everytime you enter a sewer
[3:23:23] <ミュウレ4242> gonna beat up some turtles.
[3:23:23] <%TheMattman1313> Find Woolie in a pile of trash in the sewer
[3:23:26] <+PeaceCentennial> @Vordox excuse me that's Saejima
[3:23:26] <arkv01> THUGGINSs
[3:23:27] <%spiritofmojave> @arkv01 that'd be good fun, even if it's just for a little segment
[3:23:27] <tank7013> So I can't remember, has the game started pushing that one character super hard yet?
[3:23:28] <el_phthalo> Or that cop that got introduced and then killed off because his VA liked cocaine.
[3:23:33] <President_valentine> Akiyama is best boi
[3:23:38] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat OH NO! WILD JACKSON
[3:23:47] <President_valentine> No one from Yakuza is
[3:23:50] <+JackMillerTime> oh cool
[3:23:50] <arkv01> we'll probably see kiryus semen stains as a cameo
[3:23:52] <%Omegaanimus> Stone Cold, Rikishi, Rikishi teamed with Haku who is the father of Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, who are in the Bullet Club in NJPW IT ALL MAKES SENSE
[3:23:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Ono Michio is in Judge Eyes ffs
[3:23:54] <joneworldbeater> Was that dude even fighting?
[3:23:55] <arkv01> under black light
[3:23:57] <arkv01> forms a dragon symbol
[3:23:58] <+PeaceCentennial> I want him to be a secret boss
[3:23:58] <RupanSen> That sucks tbh
[3:23:59] <%rosemon5001> that JUNGLE BOY theme reminded me of party boy from jackass
[3:24:10] <+PeaceCentennial> like man Kiryu be the new Amon
[3:24:13] <Zereaux> so its a spin off ?
[3:24:14] <Snarksmith> That's just what they WANT you to think
[3:24:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Theyre trying to make it a stand alone while also be a Yakuza game
[3:24:17] <colzack_> The Tojo clan is in judge eyes but no main characters from yakuza
[3:24:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Even if it is just like you find a couple of people beat up on the street who "Poked the dragon"
[3:24:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> well
[3:24:35] <%NWR_James> Stamaain
[3:24:37] <gustavozxd> I'm kinda glad about that, shows that they're confident in judge eyes potential as it's own thing
[3:24:39] <ShichiNoBushi> DLC character?
[3:24:40] <%joyoustechnoshrine> kiryu, old dumbass and Optional Superboss
[3:24:41] <%spiritofmojave> Old-ass hobo in Ichiban would be neat
[3:24:45] <Zereaux> What if you get kiryu DLC
[3:24:50] <%bread_assassin> No way is Yagami stronger than Kiryu.
[3:24:52] <+Shindeil> New IP is definitely the way to go, since Kazuma’s tale is done.
[3:24:52] <切捨御免> menage a trois with kiryu and amon Kreygasm
[3:24:52] <%Omegaanimus> Judgement is about a lawyer who got his client declared not guilty, so it's clearly HIGH fantasy
[3:24:55] <$CarlosEoM> just reverse MGS2
[3:24:55] <arkv01> majima seems mroe likely to appear in judge eyes
[3:25:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> If anything Shin Ryu Ga Gotoku will decide that
[3:25:01] <Rincewind1998> They need to have a game or two in the Yakuza world without Kiryu before bringing him back (even in a minor way) so there's some proper impact
[3:25:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> not Judge Eyes
[3:25:04] <Blank9> he'd have to fight you on accident for the dumbest reason ever
[3:25:04] <colzack_> I'd rather he replace amon in Shin Yakuza tbh
[3:25:04] <%GarbageNirvana> It'd be great if you never ran into Kiryu but always saw the aftermath of something he was involved in
[3:25:06] <+Shindeil> Excited for Judg(e)ment Eyes.
[3:25:07] <alwayspronking> F
[3:25:10] <+PeaceCentennial> I'm more excited for Judge Eyes than the new Yakuza game
[3:25:10] <+Spec7re> That was cool
[3:25:12] <Snarksmith> Punch his kneecaps off!
[3:25:15] <Neo_Kaiser> Oh sweet, ProJared finally spoke up.
[3:25:15] <%GarbageNirvana> For example you walk up to a pile of beat up punks
[3:25:21] <President_valentine> I just want my Akiyama spin off game BibleThump
[3:25:22] <%NWR_James> DEAD
[3:25:24] <RupanSen> I'm fine if they're just gonna keep the cameo for a sequel
[3:25:25] <Blank9> like "I believe you have a toy this child wanted, I will beat you up so you give it to me"
[3:25:29] <@lewdskeletor13> @neo_kaiser It’s not great
[3:25:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Who picks a fight with GLASSES ON
[3:25:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @PeaceCentennial well we know little about the new Yakuza game besides the hero so
[3:25:40] <%bread_assassin> Akiyama seems like a solid choice for a Yakuza cameo in Judgement.
[3:25:41] <+Sulfur_Boride> I'm honestly baffled that they decided to actually dub Judge Eyes/Judgement
[3:25:41] <%joyoustechnoshrine> sewer level
[3:25:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Getting hit with those things on hurts like fuck
[3:25:44] <+JackMillerTime> one handed
[3:25:45] <arkv01> I can't get hyped for shin ryuu no gotoku, boruto's just not as good as his dad
[3:25:46] <mad2625> kiryu never kills any one
[3:25:47] <%NWR_James> At the end of Y5 it felt like they were putting Akiyama over for his own game
[3:25:47] <+Spec7re> Style
[3:25:48] <PrincessPeachTheLurk> wait how old is Haruka in this?
[3:25:49] <Rincewind1998> @lewdskeletor13 what's the short version?
[3:25:50] <切捨御免> seriously, kiryu?
[3:25:50] <+PeaceCentennial> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli fair enough
[3:25:58] <+PeaceCentennial> Haruka is like 22 I think?
[3:25:58] <+JackMillerTime> like it was a takeout lid
[3:26:01] <+PeaceCentennial> Or 21?
[3:26:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[3:26:07] <+PeaceCentennial> 20+ definitely
[3:26:10] <+mercado94> welp
[3:26:11] <%VioletHeart> She's like 20-ish.
[3:26:12] <alexandrecau> you chinese?
[3:26:13] <+PeaceCentennial> HAVE THEY
[3:26:15] <President_valentine> @nwr_james His end sequence was so cool
[3:26:15] <+PeaceCentennial> JUST BEEN WAITING
[3:26:17] <%Omegaanimus> Yeah it's almost as if it was a compromised location
[3:26:19] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat How long have they been down here, waiting?
[3:26:19] <efratzy> MingLee
[3:26:21] <juxtest> Hobo Mafia
[3:26:23] <@lewdskeletor13> @rincewind1998 basically blames it all on his wife and provides zero evidence
[3:26:27] <Elofhousewood> Haruka is 19
[3:26:27] <%wolfofsound> RACE WAR woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:26:29] <Dr_Mooose> how long have they been down here?
[3:26:30] <arkv01> this guy looks like a discount donnie yen
[3:26:31] <+mercado94> nice
[3:26:31] <%Sabre_Basilisk> Just want Kiryu to make fun of their accent
[3:26:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shiplord13 yes
[3:26:34] <+PeaceCentennial> "hey guys go wait in that sewers until I tell you otherwise"
[3:26:34] <%VioletHeart> I just checked and the wiki lists Haruka as 19-20 over the course of the game.
[3:26:35] <%Wrashis> i forgot this place had that weird echo
[3:26:36] <切捨御免> crowbars are fucking sharp
[3:26:37] <falconx9k> SHENMUE
[3:26:38] <%NWR_James> @President_valentine he had ALL THE YAKUZA bow to him. And then 3 years later he's homeless
[3:26:39] <%AlvinTheLiar> Serrated Crowbar
[3:26:41] <+Shindeil> 19-20
[3:26:45] <Graywolf_the_45th> he's jsuut that good with a crowbar
[3:26:45] <%VantomPayne> that is actually really good chinese voice acting
[3:26:47] <SilverFaustX> wait didnt they die in 1?
[3:26:49] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s a really sharp crowbar
[3:26:58] <+Shindeil> Haruka is 19-20 in this.
[3:26:58] <Rincewind1998> @lewdskeletor13 well shit, that's a reputation death sentence
[3:26:58] <gespenst_mr_ghost> I bet if you put a lot of force into it you COULD slice someone with a crowbar....maybe....
[3:27:01] <AirlineFood74> @lewdskeletor13 he thinks we'll believe the same lies he was feeding his friends LUL
[3:27:07] <alexandrecau> think they actually got chinese va for most
[3:27:08] <gustavozxd> @vantompayne probably a native speaker
[3:27:09] <+Shindeil> No +
[3:27:09] <arkv01> I feel like some of these finishers need an XRAY
[3:27:18] <%spiritofmojave> @VantomPayne It's really weird how the game has some things somewhat authentic than dashes that with racism
[3:27:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's been 11 years since the first game. So Haruka would have to be about 20.
[3:27:19] <gustavozxd> ask Chinese people about Chinese
[3:27:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[3:27:20] <+PeaceCentennial> so when is the Jingweon going to come back
[3:27:23] <FenixSeraph> as a Chinese person it doesn't quite sound right
[3:27:27] <joneworldbeater> So, according to this series, the Chinese belong in the sewers.
[3:27:33] <FenixSeraph> it still sounds like Japanese accented Chinese
[3:27:36] <President_valentine> @nwr_james Yeah but at least he gets to do something in this game unlike the other protagonists
[3:27:37] <切捨御免> oh hey!
[3:27:43] <%NWR_James> true
[3:27:43] <+mercado94> !!!
[3:27:44] <person181> hi homeless
[3:27:46] <%VantomPayne> as a Chinese person also its better than whatever Oda was saying in 0 apatDab apatDab
[3:27:48] <arkv01> @FenixSeraph you mean chinese accented japanese?
[3:27:54] <+Ell1ot> what happened to the baby?
[3:27:54] <falconx9k> Oh hey...... you
[3:27:57] <@lewdskeletor13> So will Shin Yakuza still be in Kamurocho
[3:28:03] <FenixSeraph> Japanese VAs pretending to be Chinese
[3:28:05] <President_valentine> yeah
[3:28:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> @lewdskeletor13 Yup
[3:28:09] <Rincewind1998> I think so
[3:28:17] <+PeaceCentennial> I love Kamurocho
[3:28:19] <TheNocturnalScotsman> you gave him food instead of booze
[3:28:19] <@lewdskeletor13> @rumtumtugnutz Thanks
[3:28:21] <arkv01> @FenixSeraph ohhh yeah, kinda
[3:28:26] <+Shindeil> They purposely don’t establish her age, so it CAN be 19-20. I bet Japan would say 19, and NA would say 20.
[3:28:30] <+PeaceCentennial> I like being able to know where everything is every single game
[3:28:36] <Zereaux> @AngriestPat whats shin yakuza?
[3:28:39] <Blank9> if you watch the shin yakuza setup video, there's some serious stuff going down from the get-go
[3:28:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kamurocho feels nostalgic now
[3:28:48] <President_valentine> @zereaux New Yakuza game
[3:28:49] <gustavozxd> I wonder if they'll ever nuke kamurocho or some stupid shit LUL
[3:28:50] <%NWR_James> I'd be down for an all-kansai game though.
[3:28:58] <%Omegaanimus> Isn't Haruka back to being an idol in Shin Yakuza???
[3:28:59] <colzack_> It's basically a character on its own with how it changes each game
[3:29:01] <+PeaceCentennial> Judge Eyes is going to be in Kamurocho too, right?
[3:29:04] <arkv01> what about an otaku themed yakuza where you body anime nerds
[3:29:07] <+Sulfur_Boride> So is anyone baffled that Shin Yakuza has a gacha game with ANIME GIRLS!?
[3:29:08] <omen_setter> akiyama, sewer dad
[3:29:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiryu is in the teraser trailer for it
[3:29:17] <RupanSen> Yeah Kamurochi is probably the most well-established city in all of videogames
[3:29:17] <+starzo0> like reused assets can be lazy, but it feels different every game
[3:29:20] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat why here it's genius but with ubisoft it's lazy map reuse?
[3:29:22] <+Saggitori> Just put Kiryu in jail for another 20 years, wait until he 70 and then have future-kuza
[3:29:23] <Blank9> it's supposed to come out december this year, like how half the yakuza games do
[3:29:23] <+CourageTheCat> like the real estate dudes?
[3:29:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes basically Kiryu but not Kiryu
[3:29:26] <+PenmanLupine> I really hope they localize that Yakuza game that takes place in the past
[3:29:26] <+JackMillerTime> oh thats slick
[3:29:30] <+mercado94> @Sulfur_Boride wat
[3:29:34] <%VioletHeart> He's reverse Kiryu.
[3:29:36] <%NWR_James> he's also apparently more "hot blooded"
[3:29:36] <%spiritofmojave> And he basically looks like Spike Spiegel
[3:29:37] <Graywolf_the_45th> He's also got Nishiki's voice actor
[3:29:42] <%spiritofmojave> he seems real dope
[3:29:44] <%VioletHeart> If Kiryu is Vergil then Ichiban is Dante.
[3:29:46] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat You honestly laugh your ass of at the Shin Yakuza gacha game with ANIME GIRLS?
[3:29:46] <%Laecerelius> That didn't take long
[3:29:48] <SeventyForce> Sasuga Ichiban basically translates to Bes of The Spring
[3:29:50] <oddaddy> Ichiban is ramen... you gonna play as a chef?
[3:29:51] <SeventyForce> Best*
[3:29:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kiryu vs Ichiban is a set up Kappa
[3:29:56] <ミュウレ4242> and he fights senators w/ nanomachines.
[3:29:57] <Blank9> he's a bastard child too
[3:29:59] <SeventyForce> Kasuga Ichiban*
[3:30:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ichiban was in jail for 17 years because he got screwed over... And he's a half blood japanese so everyone hates him.
[3:30:01] <+Ell1ot> what happened to Majima?
[3:30:01] <+Shindeil> Ichiban Kasuga doesn’t seem as cool as Kazuma Kiryu.
[3:30:02] <arkv01> man lions are HGUE dicks though
[3:30:03] <%Sabre_Basilisk> So he's gonna be called uyrik?
[3:30:04] <hntronium> Not a tiger?
[3:30:13] <hntronium> I guess Majima was the tiger
[3:30:14] <joneworldbeater> So he's Josuke
[3:30:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Joseph to our Jotaro
[3:30:17] <+mcjimbo12> so wait, is shin yakuza kiryu AND ichiban? or is it just ichiban, and ichiban is now the MC
[3:30:23] <Rincewind1998> Saejima was the tiger
[3:30:26] <@lewdskeletor13> I wonder Ichiban will be the only playable character
[3:30:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Taiga is literally named a Tiger
[3:30:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ichiban is MC
[3:30:29] <SeventyForce> Ichi is the MC
[3:30:30] <Blank9> shin is just ichiban
[3:30:32] <%NWR_James> Majima was a demon
[3:30:40] <Graywolf_the_45th> Ichiban's tattoo is a gyarados
[3:30:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> If Kiryu is in it, he's a side character
[3:30:45] <+Sulfur_Boride> Remember, Ichiban's tattoo is a koi turned into a dragon
[3:30:45] <Zereaux> do lions even have like significance yakuza culture?
[3:30:45] <alexandrecau> ichiban tatoo is a dragon
[3:30:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Dude's probably tired af
[3:30:47] <+bubblebasspickles> liger zero confirmed jermaVenus
[3:30:48] <+PeaceCentennial> i mean kiryu may as well do that
[3:30:48] <arkv01> ichiban sounds like a really cheap name
[3:30:49] <%Promessa_EX> kiryu needs a retirement he's tired
[3:30:57] <@commanderclaw> I want Kiryu to replace Amon
[3:30:57] <pmtriox> unless the game tanks and they change their mind
[3:30:59] <arkv01> kiryu tho, you can trust that name in real estate
[3:30:59] <%Sabre_Basilisk> Ichi the killer confirmed
[3:30:59] <+PeaceCentennial> it's not like anyone can actually beat kiryu
[3:31:01] <alexandrecau> @zereaux kind of
[3:31:01] <%Jetsfantasy> Based on how often Kiryu gets into fights, this new guy must be in a Dynasty Warriors Yakuza
[3:31:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Also Ichiban's rocking a pretty sweet fro, so there's that
[3:31:08] <Zereaux> kiyru just solid snaked out
[3:31:10] <+Shindeil> @arkv01 Literally #1.
[3:31:11] <@lewdskeletor13> I wanna play as Akiyama again!!! woolieGASM
[3:31:11] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Ichiban’s tattoo is a koi turning into a dragon
[3:31:13] <omen_setter> i hope ichiban becomes a yaoi voice actor too
[3:31:22] <Okcfooser> cant they make a series between 0 and 1
[3:31:31] <+PeaceCentennial> @lewdskeletor13 because Omega Kick is the raddest thing in the world
[3:31:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes reincarnated Nishiki
[3:31:40] <+Sulfur_Boride> I know that Simmons from YoVideogames fucking hates Kiryu, so hearing that Ichiban's the complete opposite MUST get him excited, right?
[3:31:42] <%Omegaanimus> the New Snack Gaudi minigame in 6 is pretty much Kiryu's retirement
[3:31:45] <+PeaceCentennial> Also I like the idea that Ichiban is Nishiki's bastard child
[3:31:49] <joneworldbeater> So, at what point will we get the next Yakuza series featuring Japanese Italian mobsters?
[3:31:49] <Blank9> ichiban also is barely a part of the yakuza
[3:31:50] <@lewdskeletor13> What if he’s Nishkis son??
[3:31:52] <SilverFaustX> NIS Japan maker of disgaea might be going bankrupt
[3:31:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Don't get noticed. Fights everyone on the way.
[3:31:55] <@lewdskeletor13> woolieSMUG
[3:31:58] <omen_setter> his tattoo is magikarp turning into gyrados
[3:32:07] <InugamiTheHound> @AngriestPat would you play a musou style game for Yakuza?
[3:32:08] <+Spec7re> God that heat move is SO COOL
[3:32:08] <Blank9> like really shortly after officially joining he took the fall for a murder and went to jail for 17 years
[3:32:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes not Nishikis son
[3:32:17] <%joyoustechnoshrine> what if he's nishiki's little brother
[3:32:22] <%Radregice_> nishiki never scored
[3:32:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Like a pro.
[3:32:30] <dakuman13> That would also be very stupid
[3:32:33] <Blank9> I think ichiban is around 41
[3:32:34] <Graywolf_the_45th> Ichiban is 40
[3:32:34] <+Sulfur_Boride> What if Ichiban's actually Nishiki, but got facial reconstruction surgery, and even lost his memories, and has been told a bunch of bullshit about his past? Kappa
[3:32:35] <Darren716> The Always Pounding Ass hotel
[3:32:36] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@NWR_James) (warning)
[3:32:40] <gustavozxd> what if he's nishiki but time travel
[3:32:44] <shackbox> followed as fuck
[3:32:54] <+Shindeil> “New MC. What’s his first name?”
[3:32:56] <%NWR_James> dramatic music
[3:32:57] <ミュウレ4242> nichiki was like 20 in 1988. could be he banged one of those rando sluts he always hung out w/.
[3:32:57] <shackbox> Kiryu has no peripheral vision
[3:32:58] <切捨御免> monkaS
[3:32:59] <+Shindeil> “NUMBER ONE!”
[3:33:01] <+Th3SmartAlec> THEME OF NOIR
[3:33:07] <%Ilpala> this la noire shit
[3:33:09] <Blank9> it was really weird they put a still old dude in place of kiryu as main character
[3:33:11] <%NWR_James> Detective Kiryu
[3:33:11] <alexandrecau> lure them in the graveyard
[3:33:12] <+PeaceCentennial> what if he's ryuji's son
[3:33:13] <%Jetsfantasy> Kiryu is a highlighter in Japanese crowds
[3:33:17] <+Sulfur_Boride> Ichiban's like 41, IIRC
[3:33:17] <InugamiTheHound> boss coffee
[3:33:27] <+Spec7re> BOSS
[3:33:34] <%spiritofmojave> Boss woolieGASM
[3:33:37] <SpaceGuntank> BOSS
[3:33:43] <joneworldbeater> BOSS
[3:33:52] <alexandrecau> someya family
[3:33:53] <Vordox> The Yomei?
[3:33:55] <%Sabre_Basilisk> Is Boss actually good tho?
[3:33:55] <+PeaceCentennial> "yeah lets beat up kiryu"
[3:33:56] <切捨御免> "how do I keep getting surrounded?"
[3:33:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> "What's your plan?"
[3:33:58] <%NWR_James> You sent SIX!? Really!?
[3:33:59] <+Spec7re> ASSASSINO
[3:33:59] <%MelBrooksKA> Oh no, NOT GOONS
[3:34:01] <%Radregice_> why do people still think they can take kiryu ever
[3:34:03] <+PeaceCentennial> WHOAH
[3:34:07] <切捨御免> SourPls
[3:34:08] <theobble> what a mysterious jogo
[3:34:08] <gustavozxd> mystery battle theme
[3:34:09] <shackbox> "I sure do love getting my ass kicked" by kiryu
[3:34:11] <SilverFaustX> that bike flew
[3:34:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Cheng?
[3:34:13] <%rosemon5001> holy shit this music SLAPS
[3:34:15] <%castcode> SourPls
[3:34:15] <HeadsHeldHigh> That moped LUL
[3:34:15] <+PeaceCentennial> this fucking battle theme
[3:34:16] <Blank9> in all likeliness, ichiban's dad is probably just gonna be some US soldier
[3:34:16] <Idon__> "let's hire the kind of assassins that punch people in broad daylight"
[3:34:24] <joneworldbeater> Always Pound Ass Kiryu
[3:34:28] <切捨御免> holy SHIT
[3:34:32] <%GarbageNirvana> That motherfucker just energy waved all that shit
[3:34:33] <Idon__> damn that COMBO
[3:34:34] <InugamiTheHound> maybe Tojo is mad at you not sighing that deal?
[3:34:39] <+Spec7re> ITS SO SICK
[3:34:39] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat What do you think about this engine's combat compared to the previous games?
[3:34:41] <shackbox> kiryu hates knees
[3:34:42] <%Radregice_> the physics in the game are a little wacky you could say
[3:34:44] <%blaccbird914> blowin the world away with big dick energy
[3:34:45] <gustavozxd> over the top physics is definitely what these games needed LUL
[3:34:46] <arkv01> kiryus xman ability to discern thug names is too much
[3:34:49] <%castcode> okay he's dead
[3:34:50] <切捨御免> NOT DEAD
[3:34:51] <agadejobi> I know it's hard to get a gun in Japan, but considering how many families that Kiryu has single handledly destroyed, you think that would be the first thing on the equipment list
[3:34:52] <alexandrecau> bishopviolet velveteen is such a good track
[3:34:52] <%Jetsfantasy> Man, these businessmen must have it rough to side gig as assassins
[3:34:52] <+BoomerTiro> @Idon__ Worked for getting rid of archduke ferdinand, and Kiryu is always stopping at sandwich shops
[3:34:56] <HeadsHeldHigh> sweep the legs
[3:34:58] <+PeaceCentennial> 1 charm
[3:35:11] <切捨御免> uh

[3:35:16] <alexandrecau> Someya punked you again
[3:35:16] <切捨御免> is that guy actually dead
[3:35:16] <person181> your yakuza sense went off

[3:35:22] <arkv01> whoa what, APA hotel?
[3:35:23] <theobble> "tojo?! they've NEVER tried to kill me before."
[3:35:24] <dragoon001914> Is this the part with the guys dressed up as babies
[3:35:25] <FuqBoiSlim> are the other styles not in this game or is pat just not using them?
[3:35:27] <silverglove2012> eagle eyes
[3:35:29] <%Vicemond> gotta love those pins
[3:35:30] <SilverFaustX> sega

[3:53:10] <Elofhousewood> How old is akiyama?
[3:53:11] <agadejobi> Haruka? Haruto? I'm guessing the name of the baby wasn't important to the plot
[3:53:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Idiot Squad is here.
[3:53:16] <%PeaceCentennial> Yuta is pretty cool
[3:53:17] <+Shindeil> @th3smartalec I understood that reference.
[3:53:17] <President_valentine> Idiot Squad
[3:53:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> I have TOP MEN
[3:53:21] <%NWR_James> Some real morons in this crew

[3:53:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Rincewind1998 and the other 15%
[3:53:44] <@commanderclaw> The ?!#& Squad
[3:53:46] <twoto858> i thought he was just gonna jump out
[3:53:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Idiot Squad is how.
[3:53:47] <%TheMattman1313> Back to my home planet
[3:53:48] <%Laecerelius> Akiyama went back to his home planet
[3:53:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> welllllll
[3:53:49] <person181> that would be crazy
[3:53:50] <%Jetsfantasy> You ain't going to see better chucklefucks
[3:53:51] <%spiritofmojave> That would be silly
[3:53:54] <Elofhousewood> Idiot squad
[3:53:56] <+mercado94> because hes dumb? idk
[3:53:56] <%NWR_James> Everyone in this game is a moron
[3:53:56] <SeventyForce> Aha, ahahahaaaa... haaaa
[3:53:57] <DXLelouch24> well i highly doubt HARUKA of all people would fuck some worthless piece of shit
[3:53:57] <+Sulfur_Boride> So Akiyama's gonna go back to doing the windows?
[3:53:59] <bigbradish> Yeah but everybody is a fucking idiot
[3:53:59] <%PeaceCentennial> Yuta would be a good father
[3:54:01] <Rincewind1998> @Th3SmartAlec random Yakuza bullshit story nonsense
[3:54:01] <%bread_assassin> Yuta doesn't know where babies come from.
[3:54:02] <President_valentine> Yuta is good boi
[3:54:02] <%wolfofsound> I'm putting together a team........
[3:54:02] <+Chronobot> """"COOOL"""""
[3:54:03] <+d00msdaydan> what if the baby isn't actually haruka's
[3:54:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Oh no, I did it again!"
[3:54:03] <circular7> yuta isn't cool
[3:54:04] <snake_zen> he is an idiot
[3:54:06] <primarch_lupercal> Yea he is
[3:54:07] <%PeaceCentennial> but we all know it's Nagumo
[3:54:09] <切捨御免> he's not nagumo
[3:54:11] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Would you admit you fucked Kiryu's daughter?
[3:54:12] <DXLelouch24> also maybe Yuta got Gokud
[3:54:12] <Futurecity10> Yuta doesnt know what sex is though
[3:54:12] <切捨御免> therefore, he is cool
[3:54:13] <gekizenbu> do any yakuza know where babys comefrom
[3:54:13] <Blank9> haruto is the father
[3:54:15] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat I mean he got his ass kicked for this quest so yeah. I hope so
[3:54:15] <silvcrest> The Crime Paladin rides again!
[3:54:15] <person181> cooler than nagumo that's for sure
[3:54:15] <%PeaceCentennial> since Nagumo is SEX INCARNATE
[3:54:16] <+HellCopter> I'm trying a make a joke like "it's obviously majima" but naming any character feels gross
[3:54:16] <%Jetsfantasy> That plant explode
[3:54:16] <aristomuse> compared to Nagumo, Yuta is the literal coolest
[3:54:17] <$Valdorick> Spoiler, CRIME is the Father's baby.
[3:54:17] <Ion_Laser> Idiot Squad!
[3:54:17] <+MisterRockett> Why does Pat think Yuna is the father?
[3:54:17] <Blank9> time loops
[3:54:17] <+Taglog7> you R the father
[3:54:17] <%spiritofmojave> Yuta is atleast less of a dumbass than Nagumo
[3:54:18] <tyrianpurplehaze> Yuta's pretty cool. Even if he does have the face of a 12 year old.
[3:54:20] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat maybe Yuta's in denial or something.
[3:54:21] <Darren716> Ok seriously, how many times is "Go to Serena" an objective in this series?
[3:54:21] <%joyoustechnoshrine> the baby is kiryu
[3:54:22] <%NWR_James> Yuta is an idiot but his boss is a bigger idiot
[3:54:23] <+Th3SmartAlec> @PeaceCentennial If it is I will kill Haruka for her bad taste
[3:54:24] <DXLelouch24> like how Goku has kids but was probably just raped by Chichi
[3:54:26] <primarch_lupercal> yuta took damage for kiryu that makes him cool
[3:54:28] <+mcjimbo12> Yuta is cool, he fought Korean Vergil even though he was clearly super evil and crazy
[3:54:29] <King___Crimson> Obviously Walking Erection is the real father
[3:54:32] <VanLynx> !uptime
[3:54:32] <$Valdorick> CRIME is also how the baby finds it way, to yo~u
[3:54:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 54m.
[3:54:34] <%JackMillerTime> hes an idiot with heart...just like kiryu
[3:54:35] <alexandrecau> I mean who of the idiot squad haruka would bang?
[3:54:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yuta's the smartest Yakuza in Hiroshima
[3:54:39] <SchroedingersFerret> SUPERCHUNK is the father
[3:54:39] <Zombrocom> Well, there is no way its actually tatsukawa
[3:54:46] <+Taglog7> I wish He punched me so I'd b cool
[3:54:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> At this point, I assume the baby was just some random kid she found in the street. Bait by the Triad to get her in place for the car.
[3:54:51] <%PeaceCentennial> did you see pat try to block a knife
[3:54:52] <+Rock_Fire> Kiryu is going to talk to Yuta and Nagumo about the Idiot Initative
[3:54:57] <+Rock_Fire> LUL

[3:55:07] <+BishopBain> That's death.
[3:55:08] <alexandrecau> @Valentinius_Anodyne fatso yakuzie is the smart one
[3:55:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Slugger-Style
[3:55:09] <Graywolf_the_45th> The real father is actually Nugget
[3:55:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's fine.
[3:55:10] <%Laecerelius> It's fine!
[3:55:11] <tj_timbs> he BROKE THE BAT

[3:55:16] <+Shindeil> @engwithan_elder_god jebaited by triad
[3:55:18] <Blank9> Rainmaker is the father
[3:55:18] <%Jetsfantasy> He just hit the ground in front of the guy, its okay
[3:55:19] <silvcrest> The fade out OF LIFE
[3:55:19] <%PeaceCentennial> It's Beat Takeshi who's Haruto's dad
[3:55:19] <%spiritofmojave> Majima just had a single tear form
[3:55:21] <CurrySauseBandit> Made them ribs really tender
[3:55:22] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Engwithan_Elder_God Wait, they just place babies in the street?
[3:55:22] <Elofhousewood> Kiryu is actually just trying to find the father because he wants to ask him where babies come from.
[3:55:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "You ARE the idiot squad."
[3:55:28] <Collahflowah> hello
[3:55:30] <DXLelouch24> if thats true and the triad purposely tried to kill Haruka, THEIR SUPER FUCKED
[3:55:32] <%PeaceCentennial> He wore the mask while it happened so no one knew it was Beat Takeshi

[3:57:30] <%PeaceCentennial> remember when you bursted into an enemy base and nagumo took his mask off
[3:57:36] <%spiritofmojave> Something tells me Nagumo would be broke or fucking dead without the other Hiroshima boys

[3:58:36] <President_valentine> Yuta is probably the smartest of the idiot squad
[3:58:40] <gekizenbu> this is Kiryu's Ninja Clan
[3:58:41] <shackbox> "I used to run with Majima"
[3:58:41] <%NWR_James> Kiryu loves these idiots, and you know it

[4:03:31] <wrightlight94> NO ONE WILL NOTICE
[4:03:32] <%JackMillerTime> just get some baggy coveralls
[4:03:32] <AncientToco> WHO COULD IT BE
[4:03:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Explain to the moron next to you to not remove his mask.

[4:03:35] <%Dagman72> BUYAKA BUYAKA
[4:03:35] <DareTheJackal> SHIT'S BANANAS
[4:03:35] <applesonthemoon> isnt it canon that people know kiryu by his suit
[4:03:41] <%windsoc> to be fair, they already have trouble recognizing kiryu without a disguise
[4:03:41] <circular7> is amazing? yes, yes it is
[4:03:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> "THIS BETTER WORK"
[4:03:43] <+코코꾸라> WHO IS THAT
[4:03:43] <silvcrest> So dumb it just might work
[4:03:43] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat try to take a selfie
[4:03:44] <Ion_Laser> Who is this masked man in Kiryu's suit?
[4:03:44] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat idiot squad sqquadding
[4:03:44] <tyrianpurplehaze> It's so stupid that they avoided it the FIRST time but then they do it NOW.
[4:03:45] <%Laecerelius> Look, they spent money on these models, Pat
[4:03:45] <+Spec7re> Put your phone on mute you idiot
[4:03:45] <%PeaceCentennial> SNEAKING
[4:03:45] <maskeddudej> quick take a selfie
[4:03:46] <Basch71> this MYSTERIOUS suited man
[4:03:47] <%kenpachi9211> I don't know who that is
[4:03:49] <%Laecerelius> Can't use it only once
[4:03:49] <Blank9> Akiyama, this better work
[4:03:49] <Rincewind1998> Imagine if Kiryu just buttoned up his suit, he'd be unrecognizable
[4:03:49] <%Jetsfantasy> Hey Naruto! Put on this mask to hide your face. Don't worry about the orange jacket though
[4:03:50] <ShichiNoBushi> At least before they had tracksuits.
[4:03:52] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat What do you mean? those suit are not unique and recognizable in any way
[4:03:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> WHO'S TALKING!?
[4:03:55] <@commanderclaw> Man, this chinese is so fucking heavily accented
[4:03:55] <critikal_bit> Kiryu isn't even bothering to sneak
[4:03:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> Alright Kiryu, this is a sneaking mission
[4:03:57] <alexandrecau> not even crouching
[4:03:58] <%laserbeaming> He doesn't even try to skulk
[4:03:58] <%Omegaanimus> the only thing worse than this plan is the FACT that your team is too stupid for it
[4:03:58] <%Radregice_> kiryu doesn't know what stealth is
[4:03:59] <%Laecerelius> KIRYU DOES NOT SNEAK!
[4:03:59] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat Even worse than Kiryu recovering from gunshot wounds in hours in 0?
[4:04:00] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:04:00] <%NWR_James> IDIOT SQUAD
[4:04:01] <johnnyboyyyy> atpCap
[4:04:02] <RupanSen> Kiryu doesn't crouch
[4:04:02] <%Sabre_Basilisk> yyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[4:04:04] <Marpolo13> no one recognizes Kiryu to begin with. you think they will recognize him now?
[4:04:06] <GoldeNOVA> Did you change characters? Who are you playing as? Kappa
[4:04:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thIS IS GINTAMA
[4:04:08] <%windsoc> "What was that noise?"
[4:04:08] <+d00msdaydan> act natural, kiryu!
[4:04:09] <Dr_Mooose> Kiryu doesn't care
[4:04:10] <Ion_Laser> IDIOT SQUAD
[4:04:10] <%Laecerelius> KIRYU STRUTS!
[4:04:11] <johnnyboyyyy> 80 IQ SQUAD
[4:04:13] <bonzosan> kiryu is the only man to wear that suit for 28 years
[4:04:20] <a_mad_dragon> yeah, a vivid indigo mask is REAL good for sneaking around
[4:04:22] <%PeaceCentennial> "me leaving the entire building was an accident ok?"
[4:04:22] <circular7> "punch" is the only button kiryu knows
[4:04:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Who's footprints are these?"
[4:04:25] <+Spec7re> Okay in kiryus defense the guy is the fucking juggernaut, even if they did spot him what would they do?
[4:04:28] <fearhurst> am I supposed to put lotion on my penis?
[4:04:33] <%Omegaanimus> why such a rich blue mask???
[4:04:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> shhh
[4:04:40] <Snarksmith> I mean they don't recognize him WITHOUT the mask
[4:04:40] <+Landsharks> funny story in Mandarin the guys there actually said "you fell asleep when it was time to pay"
[4:04:41] <+SuzakuRising> Kiryu doesn't know how to sneak. He only knows how to kick ass. lol
[4:04:43] <%JackMillerTime> its a good suit
[4:04:44] <falconx9k> No shut up

[4:04:49] <Ion_Laser> But shut up tho
[4:04:50] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat So is the mask over his iconic suit worse or better than him in 0 recovering from gunshot wounds in mere hours?
[4:04:52] <+cvp5127> shut up tho
[4:04:52] <%Dagman72> すいt
[4:04:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> ppeople never recongize him tho

[4:05:05] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS
[4:05:05] <SilverFaustX> this chef was harder than a boss..
[4:05:06] <%Omegaanimus> if that's Kiryu then Hulk Hogan is Mr. America, and that's just silly
[4:05:07] <%Laecerelius> What is this?!
[4:05:07] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh. That's... nice.

[4:07:27] <+HellCopter> Who is this new protagonist? What happened to Kiryu?
[4:07:28] <Darren716> Would it be worse if he had the suit off and had his tat showing?
[4:07:28] <%Laecerelius> It's full of boxes!

[4:15:48] <%BlitzNeidhart> This is not praxis
[4:15:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kiryu was the guy in the mask all along?
[4:15:49] <AirlineFood74> yes

[4:15:58] <Rincewind1998> I think it was just to humor akiyama
[4:15:58] <silvcrest> It was to make Akiyama feel better, yes
[4:16:01] <hntronium> prolly
[4:16:03] <applesonthemoon> nobody cared who akiyama was until he put on the mask
[4:16:03] <%Jetsfantasy> 80 IQ split between the 4 of them
[4:16:03] <+Sp3ctre48> Nobody cared who he was until he put on the mask
[4:16:04] <$Valdorick> Lord-Command of Idiot Squad, the biggest idiot of all.
[4:16:04] <+PolarBearPat> costume selections
[4:16:06] <flubber3d> nobody cared who you were until you put on the mask
[4:16:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> He's just standing there awkwardly///
[4:16:10] <Blank9> all kiryu is hiding his face for is so they don't think the 4th chairman of the tojo is messing with the triads
[4:16:12] <ShichiNoBushi> I'm a shapeshifter; At Poe's masquerade...
[4:16:16] <shackbox> he's gonna get it bad
[4:16:17] <tyrianpurplehaze> Kiryu totally just wanted to shut Akiyama up.
[4:16:17] <critikal_bit> He heard you wore a mask with the idiot squad and he didn't want to be left out
[4:16:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They wanted Akiyama to feel less awkward about being the only guy in a mask
[4:16:17] <alexandrecau> so yes Ed is the darkest piece of shit in the series
[4:16:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> IT WAS ME KIRYU!
[4:16:18] <Blank9> but the tojo are messing with kiryu now
[4:16:19] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat We need some kind of undressing and hes not good enough for him to lose the shirt to

[4:23:22] <$Valdorick> The Triade makes the chair that bashes upon their skull - funny how we give our enemies the means to defeat us.

[4:30:09] <+Sulfur_Boride> And now to learn about Onigiri!
[4:30:11] <primarch_lupercal> Kiryu is a contract crime man
[4:30:11] <%THATGUY_789> Looser Squad Unite
[4:30:11] <theobble> onigiri means Japanese sword

[4:30:23] <%AlvinTheLiar> Meet him in the sex ruins
[4:30:30] <dakuman13> SUPER UNBELIEVABLE
[4:30:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Onigiri? seems to foreign to me Kappa
[4:30:34] <falconx9k> Yeah
[4:30:37] <%PeaceCentennial> Nah, Kiryu has a lot of clout still
[4:30:42] <%shiplord13> Yep, like Kiryu is a threat
[4:30:43] <Rincewind1998> @rosemon5001 he's a relatively green kid who just got a bunch of guns pointed at him
[4:30:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> @PeaceCentennial Except when he doesn't
[4:30:55] <%PeaceCentennial> You kill Kiryu, what happens when Majima gets out of jail?
[4:31:04] <%PeaceCentennial> Majima fucking rolls over the triad with his family
[4:31:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PeaceCentennial oh fuck

[4:31:12] <falconx9k> One of those damn al-bheds
[4:31:13] <Blank9> akiyama's got some pretty big respect after 5
[4:31:14] <%THATGUY_789> fucking akiyama. was a bum that got free air money
[4:31:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Kiryu would probably tell him to go fuck himself if anyone else got shot
[4:31:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat why piss off kiryu?
[4:31:15] <flubber3d> One of 'em Heihachis, eh?
[4:31:18] <%NWR_James> If they shoot kiryu's idiot squad Kiryu isn't going to help
[4:31:20] <circular7> the floor gave out on that building, it'd be crazy expensive to fix from way back in Yakuza 1
[4:31:23] <ShichiNoBushi> They would want his cooperation, and killing his friends wouldn't go well with him.
[4:31:23] <Zombrocom> I mean if you want kiryu to be your go between, best not to murder his friends right in front of him
[4:31:24] <Blank9> only triads hate akiyama
[4:31:26] <bigbradish> Shush Pat very important
[4:31:34] <rubbergumi> every one wants too build a hanted whore house
[4:31:37] <VanLynx> well then you lose Kiryu's help
[4:31:43] <President_valentine> In 5 Akiyama had every major Yakuza group bowing to him
[4:31:54] <takiyami> And then earn Kiryu's infinite wrath
[4:32:01] <%PeaceCentennial> gotta clean those humans
[4:32:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> METAL GEAR?!

[4:32:24] <SilverFaustX> no japanese word for cleaning clothes?
[4:32:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> What's a Chinese gunship doing here?

[4:33:30] <indig0bird> Right?
[4:33:31] <%Laecerelius> He needs to be dual wielding LMGs
[4:33:32] <takiyami> About that...
[4:33:33] <AirlineFood74> Kiryu has a heated gamer moment
[4:33:33] <person181> a broken dragen
[4:33:34] <%Mornaka> Japan would sink from the power
[4:33:34] <+lucaflow> Grandpa Kiryu tired of this shit
[4:33:34] <VanLynx> That's a Majima thing
[4:33:34] <tyrianpurplehaze> Kiryu: I'm gonna just kill literally everyone I even suspect might go after Haruka.
[4:33:38] <circular7> he did once or twice Pat.
[4:33:38] <%PeaceCentennial> he already swings a chair around like a psycho
[4:33:39] <a_mad_dragon> he wouldn't get that angry at triad, he'd get that angry at tojo
[4:33:40] <Blank9> if you want to die, step the fuck up
[4:33:42] <%Laecerelius> LMGs full of rubber bullets
[4:33:42] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat Didn't he do that in yakoozie 1 with the mob at the end?
[4:33:43] <%PeaceCentennial> just a quiet psycho
[4:33:44] <+DesertOfSand> @rdark_ksu Certainly at least a few characters have some bizarre mouthflapping going on
[4:33:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu is a silent rage kinda guy
[4:33:45] <takiyami> Okay, not that specifically
[4:33:46] <+miguelrod777> Mad dog of dojima
[4:33:47] <shackbox> Kiryu pulls a gun
[4:33:50] <%THATGUY_789> this game is lacking in Majima
[4:33:51] <Dr_Mooose> actually punches a guy to death
[4:33:51] <%AlvinTheLiar> Big Lo is almost as good as Big Smile Lee
[4:33:53] <DXLelouch24> did he find the asshole that hit Haruka with a car yet? cause thats when it probably happen
