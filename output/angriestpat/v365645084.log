[0:01:45] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 Hello Pat, one of my employees last night put regular gas into a diesel truck pretty much RIGHT as I got home, and having no memory of the full procedure the company takes right after an accident like that, when you are now the manager and SHOULD remember how that goes, is not a fun feeling. Especially when you find out you WERE remembering the full procedure, the whole time, but your doubt made you think you were missing something.

Mine is in Sengoku Basara (aka Devil Kings) where in the third game, Heroes, my friends and I had the theory that after he died in the first game, he went to Hell, fought and beat Satan, made him his stand, and uses him when you play him in Heroes.

Especially when you find out you WERE remembering the full procedure, the whole time, but your doubt made you think you were missing something.

[2:10:34] <%topendbuzz> so when is the anime of this?
[2:10:34] <Valdorick> Come on count, everyone knows its not the number that matters, its the value of the target. Presidents are worth like, SO MANY points.

[2:10:43] <privatesargent> hopefully the multiplayer is as good as Ace Combat Infinity, cause though the monetization of it sucked the gameplay was great
[2:10:44] <%NovaKnightmare> "Haha Im a GAMBLER"
[2:10:44] <Gruhunchously> Are there, like, no other murderers here?
[2:10:46] <cisealnine> So throughout the entire game, they are only going to refer to you as "Murderer".
[2:10:46] <@Fuggins4U> Ob-tainted

[2:11:03] <%Laecerelius> YEAH!
[2:11:04] <Valdorick> Bang bang bang, pull my President Trigger.
[2:11:04] <%Skrypto> In order to play this game, you need a fucking college education

[2:27:05] <+Gryphus23> Expert controls or basic here?
[2:27:06] <VeryTricky> can you play this in first person?
[2:27:08] <R3c0n31> @Gruhunchously oh i know but seeing it from this perspective makes it seem so close to us no flying creatures
[2:27:09] <%NovaKnightmare> "I shouldnt have gotten in the plane I get motion sick easily"
[2:27:10] <RoachOverlord> most ground targets only take 1 missile
[2:27:10] <BigCoffee> 0 casualties? are the enemies retarded?
[2:27:10] <Gruhunchously> Guess they need a...Trigger Warning.

[2:28:25] <VeryTricky> i feel like i played an old ace combat game but my memory is fuzzy
[2:28:25] <%nelsonq415> do you get more points in 1st person ?
[2:28:28] <%MagickBurritoh> THROUGH THE WRECKAGE
[2:28:29] <Goombytron> and same i forgot the name of this series for like 10 years somehow
[2:28:30] <yangaddison> I guess you are nugget then lol
[2:28:30] <KangSameda> Ace combat is pretty visceral to play
[2:28:31] <Videogamer4> I'M CUMMING
[2:28:32] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat hold down lock on button to follow the target too
[2:28:32] <callsigneagle01> eyyyy

[2:28:37] <arcaderabbit48> @defectivefire718 I'd never heard of Highway to Hell until now, and dang. Some of those Stands are clearly tailor-made for a fight, but I cant think of anything more blatant than giving a Pain Split stand to someone who is suicidal.
[2:28:37] <%Skrypto> Hydrate
[2:28:37] <+Taglog7> Hey, Lana
[2:28:38] <+Fyre_link> i love the flight path sumamry screens at the ending of missions
[2:28:39] <callsigneagle01> is useful
[2:28:42] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @AngriestPat Does this justify the JPEG Dog though?
[2:28:42] <subjectg> Remember, those who survive long enough on the battlefield start to think they’re invincible
[2:28:42] <%Iwantscandy> @AngriestPat would the AC game be good with a HOTAS or no?
[2:28:43] <VeryTricky> were there other notable jet fighter games during the 360?
[2:28:43] <mayorrev> Is this Metal Gear 6?
[2:28:46] <CopperTucker> Mission Status: SICK
[2:28:46] <Gruhunchously> What war crimes will we commit today?
[2:28:48] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> its a waste of money to put cameras on missiles, how unrealistic can you get
[2:28:50] <AnimeJedi25> DANGER ZONE
[2:28:50] <OToole42> @AncelDeLambert too close to home man, haha
[2:28:50] <BigCoffee> @callsigneagle01 Not really, it still looks hella generic right now, and the gameplay looks slow, and piss easy
[2:28:51] <callsigneagle01> You can also do the munitions cam with bombs too

[2:28:54] <callsigneagle01> @Iwantscandy It's always been geared towards controllers
[2:28:55] <Jashter18> So you are legally required to play this game with Danger Zone on loop right?
[2:28:55] <xBolts4Lifex> This is a nice treat before RE2 comes out :)
[2:28:56] <nina9669> oof

[2:28:58] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> (I joke)
[2:29:00] <casual_tj> I'm probably going to pick this up on PC.... It already looks soooo damn good
[2:29:00] <+StromkoPenguin> It's like Strike Commander's game play meets World Wrestling Federation's writing department.
[2:29:01] <2DSuperiority> zoneGasm
[2:29:02] <Triplicat> @CitrousCt other than video games my actual bullshit guess is that it's like the infinite ammo in mass effect 1
[2:29:02] <+DarkSunGvvyndolin> i tried to play an older AC game but i sucked so fucking hard that i just stopped
[2:29:02] <%Laecerelius> This jet can fit so many war crimes in it!

[2:30:43] <defectivefire718> @arcaderabbit48 its not so much pain share as it is damage share. because whatever the user does to himself really happens to the enemy. they dont just feel it.
[2:30:44] <echodrone81> it's like macross missiles, dont think too hard about where they are kept
[2:30:46] <artoflec> and Pineapples
[2:30:47] <+Jickiechan> ah okay
[2:30:47] <suikudo> might wanna resupply
[2:30:47] <lionmanguy> These drones are actually run by psychic little girls. Thought I'd forget about that bit didn't you MG, but I never will
[2:30:48] <sirmousehatter> How long till we get cow airplanes?
[2:30:49] <Gruhunchously> It would actually pretty cool if we had a game like this set in the Metal Gear universe.

[2:37:29] <arcaderabbit48> @defectivefire718 Oh yeah, Jojo is monthly too, right? I have a tendency to let chapters build up and then read them in batches. I'd rather binge an entire fight or arc than wait 6 months for it to play out. But that's just the nature of the medium, sadly

[2:38:25] <+Grayhammatter> what the heck is this music? it's a booping bop
[2:38:26] <callsigneagle01> and this is a basic track
[2:38:28] <OToole42> what would make this game even better, brrrting pilots when they eject
[2:38:28] <Valdorick> The best part about this, I just got here, and no 1 - QTE tunnel mode I've seen yet, and 2 - NO PLANE BLOOD
[2:38:28] <DestroyerDJ8> im glad the ps4 version of this comes with Ace Combat 5, been wanting to play that one for ages
[2:38:29] <%Skeletorexplains> Then the aliens attack
[2:38:30] <SeventyForce> So, a squad of dead-men-walking VS a squad of ghosts. Perfect.
[2:38:31] <$thepeoplezoo> @waifoong98 better than nothing lol
[2:38:31] <%ThePuddingDead> You're a decent pilot Pat...shocking
[2:38:33] <%topendbuzz> then drones

[2:41:03] <+StromkoPenguin> Realistically, plunging his jet into that bigger jet would've definitely done massive structural damage and changed the course of the war. But I guess they don't want to advocate kamikaze tactics.

[2:41:30] <sirmousehatter> At this point, who's NOT in solitary
[2:41:30] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> I think the AA guns are not worth that much.
[2:41:30] <SeventyForce> Use gunnn paaatttt
[2:41:30] <acurasgaming> :O really !!!! yeey!!!!!! since my wife claimed my ps4 for netflix

[2:41:33] <%kiiiirsten> don't coward out
[2:41:33] <%dmtph> Single missles
[2:41:33] <%topendbuzz> this muisc tho
[2:41:34] <%crimsonharvest> Stay focused on score i guess
[2:41:34] <SargeantDestroy> I believe in you, Pat.
[2:41:34] <subjectg> Or better yet focus on your objecive
[2:41:35] <nina9669> use gun
[2:41:35] <%ThePuddingDead> whats the most points? warehouses?
[2:41:35] <+Extrallent> maybe you need to use the guns more
[2:41:35] <%Laecerelius> focus on blowing up the base and not shooting down drones
[2:41:36] <%THATGUY_789> u spin me right round baby right round
[2:41:36] <RoachOverlord> you need some better anti ground weapons
[2:41:37] <privatesargent> guns work well on ground targets
[2:41:37] <echodrone81> guns for stationary targets
[2:41:37] <BeefyQueefer> "how dare you kill only nearly the amount we expected, to prison forever with you"
[2:41:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @IMDRanged PS4
[2:41:37] <WizzardOne> why did you resuply with 50 missles
[2:41:38] <Fujiwara_92> Change your jet
[2:41:39] <lionmanguy> Just don't shoot at drones and focus on ground targets for points
[2:41:41] <%TheSpiritof2277> Like it's not gonna be solitary either way
[2:41:41] <%MagickBurritoh> even with the better plane?
[2:41:42] <Chewfungus> Focus ground unit
[2:41:43] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> Prepare for some hardcore tickling trigger
[2:41:44] <%InsaneJackLondon> this music is great so ominous
[2:41:45] <ScreamingMeat> Why why do they want to put you in solitary?
[2:41:45] <mesamus> single missiles and gun pat
[2:41:45] <Jugg4n4ut> some bloodborne ass music
[2:41:46] <%kiiiirsten> points points points!
[2:41:47] <%crimsonharvest> Maybe even fly slow and strafe?
[2:41:47] <LuxCapere> why ur fingernails be so fuckn grimey when u in solitary???
[2:41:48] <callsigneagle01> He needs something with a bit more ground punch I think
[2:41:48] <Polengoldur> cut the engines! fall below the missile line!
[2:41:50] <+VireisSymphony> @AngriestPat You spent alot of time chaseing Drones.
[2:41:50] <Nazgul240> drones were a big distraction
[2:41:50] <Dakuu75> can you gun and missile at same time?
[2:41:50] <%IMDRanged> @ThatGuyfromMars Cool. Thank you.
[2:41:51] <Rivalshotzgp> Don’t go for warehouses those give the least points
[2:41:51] <%Niney_Who> AA Guns aren't worth many points at all cause you gotta destroy stuff to help GROUND Troops later on @AngriestPat
[2:41:51] <%THATGUY_789> need more GDP
[2:41:51] <subjectg> you just need to not waste time shooting down drones basically

[2:48:03] <sirmousehatter> did that drone just do a barrel roll?
[2:48:04] <Sinister_Aglet> gitgud pat
[2:48:04] <BaronVonDickButt> git gud son
[2:48:06] <+PNPLost_1> Guns are secondary in this kind of game
[2:48:07] <Polengoldur> ok but its better than just spinning in circles doing nothing
[2:48:09] <%ThePuddingDead> this is some metal gear music
[2:48:09] <+dpython> Only Ace Pilots use the gun
[2:48:09] <waifoong98> Guns aren't for scrub LUL

[2:48:14] <IntrepidEye> Brownie is getting attack way off in the corner of the map
[2:48:16] <%CurrySauseBandit> It gets easier with practicec.
[2:48:18] <privatesargent> guns are best used against unmoving ground targets
[2:48:18] <SubjectX07x> Gun only run do it no balls

[3:00:20] <Blank9> the story of the kid in the town that yellow team occupies in 4 is the best

[3:01:05] <+enterprise900> AND ZERO PLAY THAT TOO
[3:01:05] <xBolts4Lifex> YES

[3:01:06] <%TheyCallMeVawn> 0, 4, and 5 are the holy trinity of Ace Combat
[3:01:07] <Halospaz117> 0,4,and 5 are the best ones
[3:01:07] <+dpython> yes
[3:01:08] <DestroyerDJ8> seems like this is the sequel to 5
[3:01:08] <Triplicat> 5 is great. Zero is the best one
[3:01:08] <Chewfungus> Yellow 13
[3:01:09] <+deVaras> 5 is the best one
[3:01:09] <+PNPLost_1> Belkan War is pretty good apparently.

[3:01:14] <subjectg> 5 and Zero are amazing
[3:01:14] <mrjohncarlton> Five is pretty good but REALLY melodramatic
[3:01:14] <%dmtph> Stream 5
[3:01:14] <artoflec> isnn't Ace Combat 3's subtitlte "ElectroSphere" or some shit
[3:01:15] <Blank9> 5 is great, 0 is the best
[3:01:15] <majindusto> FUCKING ALIENS
[3:01:15] <+KSabot> 5 is second best imo
[3:01:16] <+drflashylights> Yea
[3:01:16] <mesamus> zero and 5 are amazing
[3:01:16] <UPTONOGOOD18> Shattered Skies is the best imo
[3:01:18] <$QueequegTheater> 5 is widely consudered the best one
[3:01:19] <Stratiotai2> dude i miss playing ace combat 6
[3:01:19] <+fps_russia> Ace Combat : Independence Day

[3:01:21] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm sold on Ace Combat now LUL
[3:01:22] <+JayEarly> Ace Combat has shockingly not cringy live-action FMV
[3:01:22] <xBolts4Lifex> You should plsy 5
[3:01:23] <+Gryphus23> 5 and Zero are the best ones
[3:01:23] <LunarDiscorded> You can still get 5 if you get the Deluxe Edition @AngriestPat
[3:01:24] <privatesargent> 6 is good too but it doesn't hold up to 0 4 and 5
[3:01:25] <Chewfungus> You fight the ai
[3:01:30] <BigCoffee> So can you skip 1-2-3 and not miss much?
[3:01:31] <Chewfungus> Ac3
[3:01:33] <waifoong98> Play all of them but AH
[3:01:33] <+JayEarly> Ace Combat Zero
[3:01:36] <%VRNK> 0 is the sequel to 5, right?
[3:01:38] <artoflec> just like Yakuza, 5 and 0 are the best ones
[3:01:38] <+enterprise900> 4, 5, and Zero are called the Holy Trinity of AC for a reason
[3:01:41] <callsigneagle01> @VRNK prequel
[3:01:42] <Blank9> 0 is the prequel actually
[3:01:42] <Triplicat> prequel VRNK
[3:01:42] <Gruhunchously> Our silent protagonist must remain silent.
[3:01:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@griffball13) (warning)
[3:01:46] <%jiin6> USE ALL THE GUNS
[3:01:46] <Raven1121> 5 ties into this game storyline well, its the same country
[3:01:47] <+deVaras> 5 is the dumbest so the best, it has nickleback
[3:01:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is a procure on site mission
[3:01:48] <lionmanguy> Is this a stealth airplane mission?
[3:01:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> no weapons
[3:01:50] <mrjohncarlton> Zero is the best no contest, those duels with other squads were amazing
[3:01:50] <suikudo> Open Fire!
[3:01:50] <%griffball13> this is a stealth mission
[3:01:50] <sodium_station> A Jet stealth mission what
[3:01:52] <+Grayhammatter> so don't screw it upu
[3:01:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat are you gonna stream all of this?
[3:01:52] <%sshen> Oh boy a stealth mission

[3:01:54] <%Cosairen> so, just fly good?
[3:01:57] <RoachOverlord> 2 is my favorite in the series but I know that's not really a popular opinion
[3:02:00] <callsigneagle01> fly good pat

[3:02:11] <+zetaplus> can you try that with cockpit mode?
[3:02:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> this fucking music
[3:02:18] <%jiin6> too low
[3:02:18] <Blank9> 0's live action stuff was great
[3:02:19] <mesamus> early levels, still some tutorials on handling like the rest
[3:02:22] <sirmousehatter> Zero has you fighting named legendary pilots in full on duels
[3:02:23] <Gruhunchously> Why is the music so good?
[3:02:25] <callsigneagle01> Yeah most people don't know this but in AC3 it turns out the whole thing was just a simulation
[3:02:25] <xBolts4Lifex> can we see what cockpit view looks like in rain?
[3:02:26] <%Afterman_> hashtag wheres mitch
[3:02:28] <JackalKing> What is this somber Terminator music?
[3:02:29] <privatesargent> Ace Combat 3 is interesting in that is has a plot with multiple paths, though those paths were removed in the english release

[3:39:51] <%topendbuzz> so when is the anime of this?
[3:39:51] <Valdorick> Come on count, everyone knows its not the number that matters, its the value of the target. Presidents are worth like, SO MANY points.
[3:39:56] <xBolts4Lifex> This is a very pretty game
[3:39:56] <%ThePuddingDead> Pat's a shockingly good pilot, never figured that with his character huh?

[3:40:01] <%NovaKnightmare> "Haha Im a GAMBLER"
[3:40:01] <Gruhunchously> Are there, like, no other murderers here?
[3:40:03] <cisealnine> So throughout the entire game, they are only going to refer to you as "Murderer".
[3:40:06] <KinenBr> pull the TRIGGER
[3:40:09] <+StromkoPenguin> They think they're hurting your feelings, but frankly, Murderer is a pretty badass nickname.
[3:40:12] <waifoong98> "Oh no he is skilled"
[3:40:16] <%Skeletorexplains> Sin Triggers
[3:40:18] <Mayu_The_Kitsune> i hope someone like
[3:40:19] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @Mayu_The_Kitsune not really a waste of money, they are taking junker planes and having a prisoner repair them to fool the opposing force into attacking a pointless position, its about wasting enemy resources
[3:40:20] <%Laecerelius> YEAH!
[3:40:21] <Valdorick> Bang bang bang, pull my President Trigger.

[3:55:53] <sirmousehatter> Bandog is a tsundere I LOVE IT
[3:55:54] <mesamus> AWAC is salty

[3:56:14] <nina9669> B-Baka!
[3:56:18] <CitrousCt> No, Danger Zone would never be associated with a Europlane
[3:56:21] <Marco_Apollo> i though he wasnt meant to kill the ground targets
[3:56:23] <VeryTricky> can you play this in first person?
[3:56:25] <R3c0n31> @Gruhunchously oh i know but seeing it from this perspective makes it seem so close to us no flying creatures
[3:56:27] <RoachOverlord> most ground targets only take 1 missile
[3:56:33] <mesamus> yeah there's cockpit mode
[3:56:35] <subjectg> There’s cockpit view yea
[3:56:49] <CitrousCt> There's also PSVR compataible missions
[3:56:50] <callsigneagle01> You want a crazy story? The reveal trailer for this game came out my freshman year in university. It's just now coming out and I graduated in August.

[3:57:54] <bayowolfterra> I. Love. This. Shit.
[3:57:56] <callsigneagle01> is useful
[3:57:59] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @AngriestPat Does this justify the JPEG Dog though?
[3:58:00] <VeryTricky> were there other notable jet fighter games during the 360?
[3:58:03] <CopperTucker> Mission Status: SICK
[3:58:05] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> its a waste of money to put cameras on missiles, how unrealistic can you get
[3:58:08] <callsigneagle01> You can also do the munitions cam with bombs too
[3:58:08] <%MagickBurritoh> NICE SAVE

[3:58:18] <2DSuperiority> zoneGasm
[3:58:19] <Triplicat> @CitrousCt other than video games my actual bullshit guess is that it's like the infinite ammo in mass effect 1
[3:58:19] <+DarkSunGvvyndolin> i tried to play an older AC game but i sucked so fucking hard that i just stopped
[3:58:22] <Chewfungus> Make that jpeg dog and emote

[3:58:24] <+Mottyrob> JPEG dog is already justified because of the pure balls it takes to put in a JPEG dog
[3:58:24] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> anneScare These cliffs!
[3:58:26] <OlmStranger> Are the allies actually taking down any targets?
[3:58:28] <CeeDee__> Came outta nowhere!
[3:58:30] <Gruhunchously> The canyon was put there just so you could smash into it.

[3:58:41] <+JayEarly> @verytricky Tom Clancy’s HAWX
[3:58:50] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ThePuddingDead) (warning)
[3:58:51] <privatesargent> @Jashter18 no, cause then you miss out on the AC soundtrack, and that is a crime
[3:58:51] <CalderGaming> @thepeoplezoo sure is
[3:58:52] <Valdorick> Sounds like you need to #gitgud, Count.
[3:58:55] <%THATGUY_789> does Pat have a Missle Cam
[3:59:04] <DarkKnightGrave> THE MUSIC SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:59:05] <Triplicat> pay no mind to the missiles suddenly appearing on the wings of planes like this one
[3:59:28] <mercado94> oh boy
[3:59:28] <R3c0n31> Are there really heterosexual shirtless men playing volley ball yet?
[3:59:36] <%THATGUY_789> ha
[3:59:36] <Jashter18> @privatesargent So what your saying is play Danger Zone on a speaker while the tv has the ingame music
[3:59:36] <callsigneagle01> no
[3:59:38] <Dakuu75> lol
[3:59:40] <+Skatedeandre> Yes
[3:59:43] <+Jickiechan> hey guys, did I miss pat playing fallout?
[3:59:45] <subjectg> There’s a tunnel you can fly into here
[3:59:48] <+Bloodxb> probably
[3:59:48] <suikudo> oh god that sun glare
[3:59:50] <waifoong98> @Jickiechan nope
[3:59:50] <%jiin6> don't worry you got 59+ missles left
[3:59:50] <nina9669> yikes
[3:59:52] <nepwar> holy shit
[3:59:53] <%Laecerelius> Yes Pat, you almost hit that bridge
[3:59:54] <%THATGUY_789> this is Fallout
[3:59:54] <EMP_Ike_Turner> When’s the alien mothership
[3:59:55] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Jickiechan he didn't play FO today
[3:59:58] <CalderGaming> hi steve blum
[4:00:01] <echodrone81> it's like macross missiles, dont think too hard about where they are kept
[4:00:04] <+Jickiechan> ah okay
[4:00:04] <suikudo> might wanna resupply
[4:00:08] <%Skrypto> @Jickiechan no it was Onimusha and Ace Combat tonight
[4:00:10] <%THATGUY_789> Mi:Fall Out
[4:00:11] <+chrishnaw> Where's the tunnel?
[4:00:18] <RoachOverlord> don't really need to use 2 missiles on all these ground targets
[4:00:21] <%ThePuddingDead> Solitary seems to be the go to huh?
[4:00:26] <waifoong98> Damn Itano Circus man, what an amazing idea
[4:00:33] <VeryTricky> yea i dont think i played hawx prob was an ace combat
[4:00:42] <Valdorick> Its almost like you're expendable prisoners they send on suicide missions, and want you dead because you're a suicide squad they never plan to release from prison and thus need you to die from exhaustion.
[4:00:46] <VeryTricky> fuck that was so long ago
[4:00:50] <%Cosairen> jesus how close do you need to be
[4:00:53] <+paladinstarbuster> Okay but im actually playing danger zone now and its sick
[4:00:53] <DRAGKUDO> is this in VR too?
[4:00:54] <+kuervojones> Pat. are you an Ace?
[4:00:55] <%crimsonharvest> Those bridges are probably billions of dollars worth of infrastructure
[4:01:02] <callsigneagle01> You can use missile cam with bombs too
[4:01:03] <mesamus> oh yeah i forgot hawx was a thing
[4:01:10] <nina9669> weres pats health?
[4:01:11] <privatesargent> @ThePuddingDead they can't really do anything that can be detrimental to your health, you aren't useful if you can't fly
[4:01:12] <callsigneagle01> but there's no more
[4:01:14] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @ThePuddingDead "We're going to put you in communal!" doesn't have the same ring to it
[4:01:17] <callsigneagle01> always a shame
[4:01:21] <CitrousCt> @Valdorick It says something though that penal pilots are allowed to fly high-end 5th gen fighters
[4:01:21] <sirmousehatter> @Cosairen you are never close enough
[4:01:24] <%ThePuddingDead> i know right?
[4:01:28] <WizzardOne> but you have 50 mssl
[4:01:29] <subjectg> Remember that your gun is useful for ground targets too
[4:01:30] <randomp141> @AngriestPat How do you shoot the gun?
[4:01:30] <waifoong98> Quick Pat, you have 7 minutes left
[4:01:30] <+kuervojones> @nina9669 THe green plane in right corner
[4:01:31] <+MoonlightP> every mission is like, this fuuuuuuucking music
[4:01:32] <bayowolfterra> You make ace 1st mission in all these games
[4:01:37] <skullhead51x> 7 minutes to hit that score
[4:01:39] <%ThePuddingDead> "Thats 48 hours in CASUALS"
[4:01:42] <Gruhunchously> If your aren't singed as you pass by, it's too far away.
[4:01:46] <suikudo> You need more points bruv
[4:01:48] <%ThePuddingDead> like the fuck?
[4:01:50] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @ThePuddingDead don't be naught or its a slap on the bum for you trigger
[4:01:53] <R3c0n31> Does this game have Co-op?

[4:10:47] <Blank9> don't fight the drones
[4:10:47] <sirmousehatter> At this point, who's NOT in solitary
[4:10:47] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> I think the AA guns are not worth that much.
[4:10:47] <SeventyForce> Use gunnn paaatttt
[4:10:47] <acurasgaming> :O really !!!! yeey!!!!!! since my wife claimed my ps4 for netflix
[4:10:48] <%RantingRavager> use gun?
[4:10:49] <+paladinstarbuster> night

[4:10:50] <%kiiiirsten> don't coward out
[4:10:50] <%dmtph> Single missles
[4:10:51] <%crimsonharvest> Stay focused on score i guess
[4:10:51] <SargeantDestroy> I believe in you, Pat.
[4:10:51] <subjectg> Or better yet focus on your objecive
[4:10:52] <nina9669> use gun
[4:10:52] <%ThePuddingDead> whats the most points? warehouses?
[4:10:52] <+Extrallent> maybe you need to use the guns more
[4:10:52] <%Laecerelius> focus on blowing up the base and not shooting down drones
[4:10:53] <%THATGUY_789> u spin me right round baby right round
[4:10:53] <RoachOverlord> you need some better anti ground weapons
[4:10:54] <privatesargent> guns work well on ground targets
[4:10:54] <echodrone81> guns for stationary targets
[4:10:54] <BeefyQueefer> "how dare you kill only nearly the amount we expected, to prison forever with you"
[4:10:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @IMDRanged PS4
[4:10:54] <WizzardOne> why did you resuply with 50 missles
[4:10:55] <Fujiwara_92> Change your jet
[4:10:56] <lionmanguy> Just don't shoot at drones and focus on ground targets for points
[4:10:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> Like it's not gonna be solitary either way
[4:10:58] <%MagickBurritoh> even with the better plane?
[4:10:59] <Chewfungus> Focus ground unit
[4:11:00] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> Prepare for some hardcore tickling trigger
[4:11:02] <ScreamingMeat> Why why do they want to put you in solitary?
[4:11:02] <mesamus> single missiles and gun pat
[4:11:03] <%kiiiirsten> points points points!
[4:11:04] <%crimsonharvest> Maybe even fly slow and strafe?
[4:11:04] <LuxCapere> why ur fingernails be so fuckn grimey when u in solitary???
[4:11:05] <callsigneagle01> He needs something with a bit more ground punch I think
[4:11:07] <+VireisSymphony> @AngriestPat You spent alot of time chaseing Drones.
[4:11:07] <Nazgul240> drones were a big distraction
[4:11:07] <Dakuu75> can you gun and missile at same time?
[4:11:07] <%IMDRanged> @ThatGuyfromMars Cool. Thank you.
[4:11:08] <Rivalshotzgp> Don’t go for warehouses those give the least points
[4:11:08] <%Niney_Who> AA Guns aren't worth many points at all cause you gotta destroy stuff to help GROUND Troops later on @AngriestPat
[4:11:08] <%THATGUY_789> need more GDP
[4:11:08] <subjectg> you just need to not waste time shooting down drones basically
[4:11:10] <+guyremex> is this worth a flight stick?
[4:11:11] <KaseKaizer> gotta bust out the A-10
[4:11:12] <callsigneagle01> That's just replay mission
[4:11:13] <waifoong98> Wow.....
