[1:43:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 43m.
[1:43:17] <+invictus69> GENJI ARM
[1:43:17] <+captain_history> Dogen-sama
[1:43:18] <Kiari13> this is just barely like dark souls
[1:43:21] <%Mendin> Oh that's the Petrified Blacksmith analogue
[1:43:24] <%lewdskeletor13> It has all the elements of a Souls game, Estes flask, homeward bone, bonfires

[1:43:44] <Mechazoic_Era> treasure FISH
[1:43:46] <%SrG00SE> sorry, but if this game wasnt made by From then people would be calling it a souls clone
[1:43:47] <%primax104> how's it going so far Pat?
[1:43:47] <%ScreamingMeat> All treasure lost
[1:43:48] <KnightDio> Weeb boi gets a weeb arm to kill weeb dudes
[1:43:48] <StromkoPenguin> It seems about as close to DS as Bloodborne was.
[1:43:49] <fmc009> Soulsborne Kreygasm
[1:43:49] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Back to the past Samurai PAt
[1:43:51] <+Tadashi047> you can use the buddha statue to travel too
[1:43:51] <complicatedclarity> I hope this game have it's own version of tarkus
[1:43:52] <FaryaAndWolyo> Wait was that a homeward bone, or was that the mark where you lose your dosh?
[1:43:58] <%nanov11> this is so ds
[1:44:06] <Valdorick> I feel bad for FromSoft - the will never have their action games be pure again, they will ALWAYS be compared to Dark Souls.
[1:44:12] <%0dokuro> To a talon
[1:44:15] <CybertronPrime> It's so Dark Souls it hurts.
[1:44:19] <+Austinck> Is this game better than mini ninja the greatest ninja game
[1:44:21] <+Clone9o> To a gun
[1:44:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> GET OVER HERE
[1:44:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@jyeowa)
[1:44:23] <cbdg> well it doesn't help if all UI elements look nearly the same
[1:44:24] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 Pat: there's no way this highly modifiable robo arm could have come from the 7 foot tall master craftsman. Also Pat: HaHa I'm a weeb and have to put it in japanese, leaving anyone who wants to listen to the stream while they play or do something else with their balls in their hands.
[1:44:25] <RedDeadWine1277> turn arm into gun
[1:44:26] <Make_me_mad> If they didn't want it compared to souls, they should make it less of a souls game.
[1:44:30] <Deekman> dogs are 1 hit kill with shurikens
[1:44:30] <FaryaAndWolyo> What's wrong with it being darksouls esk? This is a really good game.
[1:44:31] <%Mendin> @Valdorick Nah they just need to bring back their mecha games
[1:44:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The game has obvious and blatant parallels to the Souls series, denying that is ridiculous
[1:44:37] <$cureneckbeard> Drop your thick shields
[1:44:37] <Valdorick> I can't wait for Metal Wolf Chaos XD to come out, and all the people who compare it to Dark souls
[1:44:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's an Oni Breaker, obviously

[1:44:39] <AlasterAngelo> I don't understand Japanese

[1:45:05] <MrDonTacos_> just give me the rocket arm
[1:45:07] <%connos_livereview> i wonder if the arm is his wife
[1:45:07] <%DK_Rance> thats kool

[2:14:01] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 so, the story of how i got poop in my pants without pooping? I kayaked out to an island in a lake for a picnic, hadn't pooped in days. then I got the squirts, had no time to get back to land, so i squatted in a bush. but splatter is a bitch. got it all on the seat of my pants and inside my shoes. wanted to die. after I kayaked back I took a scalding hot shower and scrubbed myself pink. but when I started to dry off with a towel, I realized it was the towel I sat on in the kayak. oops.
[2:14:01] <Apocalypse89> You've gotten a few just killing randos
[2:14:01] <+Tkelii> THEYRE 10 COINS PAT

[2:14:03] <%SickBangerzM9> omg hes actually doing "i might need it later" thing
[2:14:04] <%daisyyyy> Its a common drop
[2:14:04] <+ataxiasuffuse> never use the things, what if you need them later
[2:14:05] <DayDayMaccin1> Yo get them from enemies
[2:14:05] <+KragPlays> You buy more Pat, that is what money is for
[2:14:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> remember, pat doesn't use things because he might need them one day
[2:14:06] <dukenux> First time i see Pat playing Sekiro, and he just murders a giant chicken LUL
[2:14:06] <+loukemia83> you get at least one every time you kill an enemy
[2:14:08] <+zaworldo> PAT @AngriestPat THEY'RE SUPER CHEAP. you also get MORE from killing enemies

[2:23:10] <Calamity2007> @Rayorin Nah Pat went down so fast they didn't even have time to S rank him
[2:23:11] <Devorteck> Locked into the bad ending now BibleThump
[2:23:11] <natebud> And then Pat remembered this is a stealth game too.
[2:23:13] <+D1ABOL1K> That was at least a child or tow

[2:23:21] <%magicaki> I thought dying would avoid spreading dragon AIDS, but it doesn't.
[2:23:23] <thegreenbenis> STILL COUNTS
[2:23:23] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> they get sick on respawn
[2:23:24] <%0dokuro> just remember "stealth"

[2:23:33] <+captain_history> i think the sickness is when you die after resurrecting once

[2:24:06] <welcometolossantos> just do it perfectly
[2:24:07] <Zombrocom> @MarylandJutsu I am 99.9% sure that is not the case, respawning spreads dragonrot, there is no reason not to rez

[2:24:22] <AlasterAngelo> @LegendaryDorkKnight you'd be right
[2:24:23] <KnightDio> Who cares about the sickness anyway, you're immortal and it doesn't affect you, isn't this like Pat greatest dream ?

[2:35:28] <+asgard147> Pat....are you okay?
[2:35:30] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> This game throws spirit tokens at you, the game WANTS you to use the most important part of your toolkit
[2:35:35] <$ESP_ROOT> oh. yeah enemies drop spirit tokens frequently
[2:35:36] <larrata20> in retrospective, DS nd bloodborse had pats one salvation: barely no platforming

[2:35:56] <$ESP_ROOT> @HyperCharge_Sam very
[2:35:58] <%magicaki> Literally a full half of the mechanics are using the damn bullets.
[2:36:01] <kingra> Tengu <3

[3:01:38] <Storm_Samurai> "A sandwich refers to an arrangement of ingredients, such that everything is between 2 pieces of bread (or a split roll). A non-burger filling (let's say a grilled chicken breast) on a typical hamburger bun would be classified as a grilled chicken sandwich, not a chicken burger."
[3:01:38] <+D1ABOL1K> burgers are ground

[3:07:34] <$ESP_ROOT> :)
[3:07:34] <complicatedclarity> I'm pretty hyped to play japanborne
[3:07:35] <sir_nack> this game looks like what I wanted Nioh to be
[3:07:38] <%Zamorouskiwhich> monkaS
[3:07:38] <Picia000123> So apparently, many people are getting whooped in this area LUL
[3:07:41] <%PokemonTrainer> Pat is bad sneaky
[3:07:58] <DracaenaLeaf> How come that enemy can see behind walls while everyone else is blind
[3:08:03] <reiju_22> what does the red symbol mean?
[3:08:05] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Pro tip: sneak good
[3:08:06] <%lloyddboy> GOO-erd
[3:08:06] <cbdg> fire
[3:08:08] <Ebisrator> pats stealth = running on roofs and falling into pits
[3:08:11] <ThePlatformPodcast> PS4 hype
[3:08:20] <Picia000123> I just checked a couple of streams and this is BIG hurdle
[3:08:25] <Devorteck> @reiju_22 it's an unblockable attack
[3:08:27] <@BigNaturalMan59> akko?!?
[3:08:33] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat just curious but how come you never finished Nioh?
[3:08:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> red symbol means you can instakill if you parry
[3:08:34] <%0dokuro> Ako's opium
[3:08:36] <%Order_of_Mystery> thats a lifesaver
[3:08:37] <complicatedclarity> that actually is a bloodborne dog noise holy shit
[3:08:41] <korean_random> L O R E
[3:08:51] <%PokemonTrainer> apatBig sneak
[3:08:54] <lizard0tm> Good job
[3:08:54] <Senselessvirus> @AngriestPat Pat you need to master the technique of [GRAPPLE AWAY] when people start searching for you
[3:08:58] <s0lidsnekeater> so is it worth it lads?
[3:09:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Samurai Bloodborne looks rad.
[3:09:09] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Trailer music PogChamp
[3:09:10] <sir_nack> im really loving this battle music

[3:09:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> How's the progression, chat? Since I heard you don't level up
[3:09:28] <ThePlatformPodcast> Rage
[3:09:28] <+senordingdong2> It's actually Bloodborne Gaiden
[3:09:31] <complicatedclarity> murder them pat murder everyone zoneRage
[3:09:32] <Absurd_Lizard> do we know how long the game is yet?
[3:09:39] <$HentaiSenpai9K> From knows how to make music that's for sure
[3:09:43] <%PokemonTrainer> Don’t miss the money
[3:09:45] <Ebisrator> oh man, requiring a button to gather souls is weird
[3:09:50] <lizard0tm> Just realized?
[3:09:50] <Picia000123> Good Pat using imtems :)
[3:09:54] <%ElenaManetta> Dead Guy: Can't complain
[3:09:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm not sure if I like the sound of a Tenchu game with the souls game engine

[3:10:01] <rytisone> its not Subhuman though
[3:10:04] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Battle music and level music, no music at the temple ... interesting
[3:10:04] <+redanimator> has bigger budget lol
[3:10:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nioh was kinda lame tbh
[3:10:04] <+Punisher7771> if your a ninja why are you wearing red?
[3:10:05] <rosemon5001> i kinda love the fact the items auto pickup whitout needing to search corpses
[3:10:05] <Storm_Samurai> Why is it better than Nioh
[3:10:05] <%valkuma> thats weird because itseems like a really clumsy version of Nioh
[3:10:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Nioh was a Souls hoax
[3:10:07] <Picia000123> I't really not Nioh
[3:10:10] <@Mechz71> I can explain it
[3:10:11] <IntrepidEye> Theres music in general. Even now its playing quietly
[3:10:13] <%mastertwin2> It's got that FROM q u a l i t y
[3:10:14] <+D1ABOL1K> NIoh 2, more like Nioh Boo
[3:10:14] <%Rngiddion> i mean this is nothing like Nioh, Nioh is a diablo game with souls game mechanics
[3:10:14] <korean_random> it looks weirdly similar to Nioh as well
[3:10:15] <$ESP_ROOT> hes gonna pee
[3:10:15] <%H0rnedG0d> needs more Subhuman
[3:10:16] <BigCoffee> Nioh has other issues, like random loot
[3:10:17] <Psyramics> MMO loot is a bad idea in everything, even MMOs
[3:10:17] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH FUCK LiVE ON STREAM
[3:10:18] <VRNK> pat's gonna fuck

[3:19:35] <ValdakMX> use your devil trigger!
[3:19:36] <%PokemonTrainer> Jump on their heads
[3:19:40] <natebud> I cant believe the lookouts actually have good eyesight. Not in my stealth game!
[3:19:44] <Valdorick> They're blood vials, but in reverse - you spend them before you take damage, so you save on life...
[3:19:49] <Mozahar_the_corpse_maker> PAT CHEAKE THE FIRE
[3:19:51] <$Metal_Slime_King> Watch out for evil cocks

[4:02:02] <+zaworldo> Each time he dies, Npc's have a chance of getting the rot. Every NPC can get rotted, and resurection doesn't affect it. Only dying and respawning rolls their rot chance

[4:12:59] <alcors_wisdom> that wasnt very pump pur rum @doc_ock_rokc
[4:13:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> GUNs are the only weakness of Samurai, that's how Nobunaga won
[4:13:20] <AllenDeadman> pat, do you know how to jumpkick?
[4:13:24] <nobody12349> Step 2- Have someone yell at you randomly
[4:13:32] <waifoong98> @nobody12349 step 1 - don't play DS Kappa
[4:13:32] <b9k9com> poor guy, just wanted to go for a walk
[4:13:34] <alcors_wisdom> i mean you arent wrong
[4:13:36] <%hawk_rush> i'm surprised there's no running backstab animation
[4:13:37] <nobody12349> Step 3- Cut off your own hand
[4:13:40] <%connos_livereview> nobunaga lord of the GUN

[4:17:40] <alcors_wisdom> @killface17 well while they were highly trained and there are some documentation of them fighting the monguls fairly well briefly theres also a somewhat hilarious anecdote where the quality of steel in a samurai's sword was so poor that malitia would tie sod and grass to their armor and it would stop their swords

[5:28:49] <%ThatRandomGuy661> ThatRandomGuy661 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey Pat, I've been leveling a DRK lately and it got me thinking what they might change in ShB. Maybe making bld wpn and bld price one button like they did with WAR? I hope they manage to keep up the quest quality in ShB, esp with it being the trailer job.
[5:28:51] <Jontman42> I'm 95% the door you couldn't open was there
[5:28:53] <%marvinbrewton25> lmao just the fact thats its a single bright shiny in a dark cave implies backdown
[5:28:57] <Rhide1> Pat was right to run away, you need to be curse like in DK1 to kill ghost
[5:28:58] <+Shadicara> He'll get in and the 4 kings will spawn

[6:06:35] <Run44forrest> dont let anyone know you leveled up DEX
[6:06:37] <derap41> I omitted the rape
[6:06:39] <+verelme> You choked and started getting greedy at the end. Rushed him down carelessly and at low posture
[6:06:39] <Deekman> don't talk to NPC until after you've cleared out the ads
[6:06:41] <SnaKemuho> you literally have to play greedy in this, or their stamina just regens
[6:06:42] <b9k9com> You need to take a bit more time in the fights, back off and let your posture bar go down a bit, then re engage. @angriestpat
[6:06:42] <%hawk_rush> Can you still deflect the red-marked attacks?
[6:06:43] <complicatedclarity> liquor is a buff

[6:07:02] <%hawk_rush> Yeah, I think blocking itself is worthless here
[6:07:05] <TwistedVerse> steal the beer and get the buffs for yourself
[6:07:05] <TangledVirus> I think Pat is having the wrong aproach to the game...
[6:07:06] <xeslana666> jump deflect or attack... I think

[6:17:14] <xeslana666> is there he a mini boss?
[6:17:24] <Bouldus> so you could probably jsut try get a stealth attack of on them twice
[6:17:27] <%startadevy> took a nap, did not know this was happening today
[6:17:27] <%0dokuro> If you stealth you can potentially eliminate one health bar right away, there isn't a down side.

[6:17:54] <%marvinbrewton25> question is did fromsoft think that hard on fire+alcohol=burning man?
[6:17:56] <SnaKemuho> minibosses in this game genuinely feel harder than normal bosses

[6:18:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> That's what I've been saying Stealth kill him twice @angriestpat
[6:18:33] <tacoisgoods> just use royal guard like woolie
[6:18:38] <+Tadashi047> you can skip these guys to save health
[6:18:42] <+Shadicara> give em the axe
[6:18:48] <burntwing> 10 bucks he doesn't even makee it to the boss
[6:18:50] <AllenDeadman> frustration is getting bigger
[6:18:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@xeslana666) (warning)
[6:18:52] <%marvinbrewton25> see pat just go in hard and everytime you just wreck them
[6:18:53] <mastermidget23> Speedrun to beat the game so you can use your prosthesis AND your devil bringer.
[6:18:54] <%TheDapperChangeling> Honestly, I can't help but think Sekiro looks..not great. Maybe because I love my RPGs, but..I dunno.
[6:18:57] <rytisone> wasuuuuuup
[6:19:00] <%0dokuro> You got this Pat
[6:19:08] <T_sarr> man this looks easier than bloodborne. Whys he struggling so much
[6:19:10] <%TheDapperChangeling> It just doesn't interest me at all.
[6:19:34] <xeslana666> enemies have unblockables
[6:19:37] <%0dokuro> Nice
[6:19:38] <%marvinbrewton25> see
[6:19:39] <%XzileGaming> do the cool thing though
[6:19:41] <SnaKemuho> @thedapperchangeling there's a lot of focus on stealth, and stealth is very barebones
[6:19:46] <derap41> 20% there
[6:19:50] <%raios22> Is this game parry really parry heavy?
[6:19:52] <%0dokuro> Its really not lol
[6:19:52] <%startadevy> badass matatabi
[6:19:57] <%Edgy_Macaroon> your too aggressive
[6:19:57] <SunsetJack> God no.
[6:19:59] <%marvinbrewton25> this game is not as easy as bloodborne XD
[6:20:05] <%Plague_Nurse> Bloodborne is easier
[6:20:09] <+0oki> Is it possible to parry every attack or no?
[6:20:10] <%0dokuro> Slightly
[6:20:10] <xeslana666> stealth does seem barbones that you mention it
[6:20:10] <SunsetJack> This game feels very reaction based.
[6:20:11] <aimlesshealer> How's Pat liking the game so far? I just got here
[6:20:13] <T_sarr> hows the dodge feel?
[6:20:16] <majindusto> Watch Paige be better at it lol
[6:20:21] <complicatedclarity> the difficulty of this game seems pretty nuts
[6:20:22] <HaloPlayerNamedJohn> This game is like the Anti-Pat Souls
[6:20:22] <%wizkid50000> Well he is ANGRIESTPat
[6:20:25] <Cymen90> @aimlesshealer He has been getting rekt but it is amazing
[6:20:27] <+Tadashi047> it is possible to parry any attack that isn;t red
[6:20:32] <%0dokuro> You also had giant freakish weapons to help
[6:20:33] <derap41> Isn't like that with all fromsoft games tho
[6:20:35] <mastermidget23> Is he invincible during the killing blows?
[6:20:36] <sukiyakiwestern> foccus on posture not health
[6:20:41] <%0dokuro> instead of just one katana and a gun arm
[6:20:46] <stirlingw17> enemy line of sight seems pretty aggressive in this game
[6:20:47] <drugbustincat> @AngriestPat Have you ever taken acid or shrooms
[6:20:48] <xeslana666> you can counter red attacks 2
[6:20:49] <garbageheaphound> maybe use the smoke thinga
[6:20:54] <+D1ABOL1K> YES
[6:20:54] <SnaKemuho> @mastermidget23 yeah, like parries and backstabs in Souls
[6:20:55] <hanzofiyuri> Does attacking an enemy give you back any health, like in Bloodborne? I can't tell, because the health bar is covered.
[6:20:56] <+the_krypto_knight> I feel like if they really wanted you to stealth your back stab wouldn't be so loud it ruptures eardrums
[6:20:57] <%TheDapperChangeling> Honestly, it just seems so barebones compared to most Fromsoft. Like, so simplistic.
[6:21:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @T_sarr enemies attack faster than in bloodborne, your dodge is not invincibility frames, and you have to master knowing whether each attack is something to jump, block, or dodge
[6:21:02] <+verelme> Yes, of course.....
[6:21:03] <mr_slaide> Coward it out!
[6:21:03] <sukiyakiwestern> also use the sugar for stealth after killing all the minions and sneak attack
[6:21:05] <silverglove2012> he is huge
[6:21:05] <waifoong98> yes, Posture eleminate whole pip of HP
[6:21:05] <tacoisgoods> be aggressive... b e aggressive
[6:21:10] <+Clundy> Think DS1 poise
[6:21:15] <%marvinbrewton25> Hmm that guy in blue might become a npc later try to keep him alive hint hint

[6:21:22] <silverglove2012> h
[6:21:22] <derap41> Hide in a box
[6:21:23] <waifoong98> so it is more important after all
[6:21:29] <%aishman> @TheDapperChangeling I dunno, Otogi 1 and 2 ain't exacly the most complex games in the world
[6:21:32] <+D1ABOL1K> LUL
[6:21:35] <%aishman> Nor was Ninja Blade
[6:21:35] <T_sarr> okay that explains it
[6:21:38] <+GuttlessCashew> parry attacks more
[6:21:41] <xeslana666> exciting flute music
[6:21:42] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @T_sarr in Bloodborne you can Souls Cheese easily. In Sekiro you cannot nearly as easily.
[6:21:43] <%TheDapperChangeling> @marvinbrewton25 What's this Fire Emblem shit? Find the non-evil looking guy and keep him alive?
[6:21:46] <b9k9com> focus on not getting hit, not health @angriestpat
[6:21:49] <+Austinck> how early in the game is this?

[6:37:20] <SnaKemuho> there's a special ability to deflect thrusts, very helpful vs spears @angriestpat
[6:37:21] <meromaromiro> Mikiri counter on thrusts
[6:37:21] <derap41> Just do it pat
[6:37:21] <%Konquerer> just don't get hit

[6:37:24] <OrochiSheewa> *cough* *cough*
[6:37:24] <+YabbaTroll> just block 4Head
[6:37:24] <34thLab> Blocking is for cowards

[6:37:31] <ItsJustShawn> instead of bad, good instead
[6:37:31] <Imabeast78> So only the pure of heart who haven’t played dark souls won’t have the bad habits and be the true shinobi
[6:37:32] <Bouldus> the contradicting advice is pretty prime Kappa
[6:37:32] <+reddpop_> Just do it
[6:37:32] <Fenrisulfr_V> Thrust attacks are unblockable. Mikiri counters are for thrust.
[6:37:33] <Deekman> any attack that pops that red symbol is unblockable
[6:37:33] <mr_slaide> Yeah, but there people here are mostly idiots.
[6:37:33] <televisedrevolt> Cheese his shit
[6:37:33] <+Kairi__> Woolie and Pat streaming at the same time fml

[6:37:35] <BourneWarrior> JUST BLOCK 4Head

[6:37:39] <Caidezes> Try not getting hit.
[6:37:40] <Run44forrest> pat either go full coward or full dick out
[6:37:42] <SeaReally> thrust counter is good but i dont think you have it
[6:37:42] <future_famous_person> just don't get hit 4Head
[6:37:42] <b9k9com> if you kill him you might win BrokeBack
[6:37:43] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Chat is always wrong
[6:37:43] <+KragPlays> @bighugs You can deflect them though
[6:37:44] <%nameless_majin> LUL
[6:37:44] <Psyramics> its obvious, Pat. block the attacks that can be blocks and don't block the ones that can't. /s
[6:37:44] <Bouldus> just play better Kappa
[6:37:45] <%Edgy_Macaroon> your trying to kill him too fast try dodging and feeling him out
[6:37:48] <Mr_Strut> Just do better
[6:37:48] <Restainly> Don’t want use resurrection pat effects story and I know u hate that
[6:37:49] <derap41> Its not hard just don't not survive
[6:37:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just don't get hit yeah 4Head
[6:37:52] <mr_slaide> Kill him before he kills you.
[6:37:55] <$Billyuppercut0> Jumping is an effective dodging method
[6:37:56] <majindusto> BLOCK...but also DON'T BLOCK!!!
[6:37:57] <%TheDapperChangeling> No, just do it tho
[6:38:00] <rytisone> give controller to Paige to beat it for you
[6:38:01] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Really watch the poise gauge. Go HARD when they are close
[6:38:02] <complicatedclarity> we're all a bunch of stupid assholes pat, don't trust us zoneLove
[6:38:03] <+Duskysan> The movement in this game looks so dope
[6:38:04] <captainthunderwolf> @Psyramics To be fair, that actually is the "obvious" logic.
[6:38:05] <%ScreamingMeat> Deflect or dodge perilous stabs, jump perilous swipes
[6:38:06] <+zaworldo> @Restainly death affects the story, not resurrecting
[6:38:07] <%0dokuro> Poor shield peoples
[6:38:08] <Wobuzhidao> Just red parry Chun's super Pat
[6:38:08] <+Kairi__> Backseat gaming for this game is borderline useless, I think.
[6:38:10] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat I like the fact that everyone in chat is apparently experts on a game that they most likely haven't played.
[6:38:11] <MeowmereArt> @Kairi__ support ur boy pat cause streaming is his main thing FeelsBadMan
[6:38:11] <sukiyakiwestern> hikiri counter :(
[6:38:11] <%hntronium> Well Pat, you block the blockable attacks and don't try and block the unblockable attacks. Its that simple! Also do the run without getting hit
[6:38:11] <+Katyusha94> Drop your sheild
[6:38:13] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I have noticed that after reading about guarding improving posture regen, you still immediately drop your guard. Something to work on, mayhaps? rooThink
[6:38:14] <T_sarr> man that coin shit is SO bad
[6:38:16] <silverglove2012> wait maybe range vs spear
[6:38:19] <aimlesshealer> Have we seen Paige play a stealth game before?
[6:38:19] <captainthunderwolf> The unblockable attacks even have a literal visual warning on-screen.
[6:38:31] <+zaworldo> @stabbityrabbit it literally TOLD him to deflect it when he first ran into the guy
[6:38:32] <%TheDapperChangeling> Enemies don't respawn huh...
[6:38:33] <%hntronium> Maybe stealthing the monk would be better?
[6:38:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Hoist thine barricade :^)
[6:38:35] <derap41> We need 7 perpendicular pats all crossing at a 90 degree angle
[6:38:36] <+GuttlessCashew> backseating is for fun not advice
[6:38:37] <T_sarr> he looks blind
[6:38:38] <%0dokuro> Mortal enemy
[6:38:40] <mr_slaide> Don't give up, skeleton!
[6:38:45] <%ScreamingMeat> SKELETON WARRIOR MONK

[6:38:56] <sukiyakiwestern> theres a counter specifically for thrust attacks
[6:38:59] <Bouldus> o//
[6:39:08] <%TheDapperChangeling> Is this the nemisis system? /s
[6:39:11] <%0dokuro> shuriken to reset his frames
[6:39:12] <SnaKemuho> that one skill that deflects thrusts is the best thing for this
[6:39:20] <Ninjagregory98> Stealth him twice?
[6:39:27] <%TheDapperChangeling> Ok, now switch to cavalier to shred his guard.
[6:39:29] <%hntronium> run away!
[6:39:31] <+Papafleish> dude how long have you been on this fight
[6:39:31] <majindusto> RESURRECTION!!!

[6:39:53] <%Ninestempest> can't you PARRY the unblockables?
[6:39:53] <+zaworldo> Can someone tell him about the skill that is made specifically to counter thrusts
[6:39:55] <Run44forrest> the ghost thing

[6:40:24] <AllenDeadman> isn't there a skill that let's you couter trust attacks better?
[6:40:25] <+sergeantsuperbeast> Hey look, not a key
[6:40:29] <%ranek000> ranek000 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[6:40:29] <+alex_id> Just got here; this game looks great.
[6:40:30] <Restainly> Don’t resurrect man ur gonna regret it
[6:40:32] <%TheGreatBamBe> ah i was thinking of inshun
[6:40:36] <Hydrapissed> 死
[6:40:36] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat good work, but remember you have a grappling hook for a reason
[6:40:36] <sirtommygunn> Dudes just looking like... "yup, thats a dead body"
[6:40:38] <+sleepwalk1221> God that looks so satisfying
[6:40:40] <+verelme> The thing not to do is whack on them until they parry you
[6:40:41] <rytisone> Sekiro: The Quest For Anal Beads
[6:40:41] <derap41> That was just one of the shinobi hunters
[6:40:44] <$valriot> I love how Pats trying to use his katana like its the fuckin Dragonbone Smasher
[6:40:45] <Crankthulhu> Shocked axe attack doesn't do more poise damage
[6:40:47] <%0dokuro> I love it
[6:40:49] <Run44forrest> bro was just looking at the flowers
[6:40:50] <SnaKemuho> @allendeadman there is and it's the best skill in the game
[6:40:51] <+GuttlessCashew> jump off cliffs more
[6:40:55] <SeaReally> yes there is a counter for thrusts
[6:40:59] <koolkid1208> @AngriestPat there is a skill that lets you deflect the thrust attacks!
[6:41:00] <%ScreamingMeat> You can wait on the death screen until they are far enough away for your Resurrection to not alert them and then stealth attack them.
[6:41:03] <Load_Complete> Hey so what's the general conses on this game?
[6:41:04] <+Kairi__> 滅殺！死んね！
[6:41:05] <Run44forrest> so pat you plan on finishing the game today?
[6:41:06] <garbageheaphound> dont forget the pagoda
[6:41:07] <b9k9com> now you only have to fight the 2nd and 3rd shinobi hunter ^_^ @angriestpat
[6:41:13] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat The biggest change is the lack of stamina. No reason to back off or drop the shield.
[6:41:18] <MeowmereArt> @Restainly it does not matter if you resurrect or not, as long as you die you spread dragonrot. you could not res at all and you die enough time you still spread it.
[6:41:19] <Crankthulhu> @Load_Complete HARD
[6:41:25] <%0dokuro> Carps
[6:41:25] <aimlesshealer> @Cymen90 I was wondering about that. That's interesting
[6:41:26] <Restainly> I don’t even know what a boss and what’s a mini boss
[6:41:27] <%graffitisamurai> Does this game penalize resurrection??
[6:41:29] <sukiyakiwestern> im about 4 hours further. this game is a boss rush basically
[6:41:29] <%aishman> I think cause they want to have a huge focus on blocking, which multiple blocks does the most poise damage.
[6:41:30] <%TheDapperChangeling> @Load_Complete That it's Fromsoft, so good. However, I'm curious of how it actually is. Looks fairly boring to me. :\
[6:41:40] <T_sarr> anyone knows how long this game is?
[6:41:44] <captainthunderwolf> @Cymen90 Or rather, they shifted the reason to stop blocking to your on poise bar, which is a really creative decision.
[6:41:50] <Nina96> PogChamp
[6:41:52] <%ScreamingMeat> You can wait on the death screen until they walk far enough away for your Resurrection to not alert them and then stealth attack them.
[6:41:53] <Patzzki217> noice
[6:41:54] <future_famous_person> @T_sarr ign said it can take 50 hours

[6:43:41] <%ScreamingMeat> If You wait on the death screen until they walk far enough away for your Resurrection to not alert them and then stealth attack them @AngriestPat
[6:43:42] <$valriot> Thing is i can see Pat unintentionally waiting for his stamina to refill
[6:43:42] <%0dokuro> Im curious on the dlc for it
[6:43:43] <MeowmereArt> @Restainly dragonrot spread regardless if you res or not, just dont die for good and use your rez.

[7:01:42] <%LiquidBinge> Does this game have dogs
[7:01:42] <%joeobo2> this is nothing like zelda
[7:01:43] <+pnw_mgtow> At least those giant chickens aren't as freaky as the crows were
[7:01:44] <TakesGuts> BBC
[7:01:47] <orphancrippler_> This game sucks not enough cute cardboard jumpscares 2 out of 5
[7:01:52] <Deekman> Pat are you gonna grab the Sinking City?
[7:01:54] <%TheGreatBamBe> yes there are dogs
[7:01:54] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Chickens... I'm supposed to take this seriously, right? LUL
[7:01:55] <SnaKemuho> Fireworks merchant is to the right of the horse arena @angriestpat

[7:02:27] <SpaceKingVeeg> nearness is relative
[7:02:28] <%KilljoyHexx> we all died too much, thats how pat got the dragon gout
[7:02:34] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Crows = Spoopy, Chickens = Hilarious
[7:02:44] <AllenDeadman> just a reminder, pat has not beaten the horse man
[7:02:46] <%TheDapperChangeling> @PlainSimpleTailor What about black chickens?
[7:02:47] <SnaKemuho> I'm not sure if you can get to him before killing the horse though

[7:12:47] <Deekman> would that flip attack be good against sweep attacks?
[7:12:49] <lostvayne91> and the shinobi hunter?
[7:12:53] <TaurusOxford> @Restainly I don't think that's true.
[7:12:55] <%TheDapperChangeling> The big issue I'm seeing with Sekiro is how do you make this replayable? No builds, no branching paths, and the combat doesn't appear to be good enough to justify repeat playthroughs like DMC
[7:13:04] <Cymen90> @lostvayne91 Got him
[7:13:05] <SpaceKingVeeg> flip goes go over sweeps, learned that from the lobos streams

[7:13:46] <Ner234> @TheDapperChangeling Also not everthing needs to have crazy replayaablity

[7:22:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> She seems pretty alright as a first boss
[7:22:32] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Maybe it's because I'm not actually playing it, but a lot of enemy moves seem obvious to avoid
[7:22:35] <+maxamillion629> Shinobi tools
[7:22:36] <%king_wragles> I think that's pretty good if the player can barely see the wire

[7:26:10] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat BIG TIP: You can unbalance her when she jumps to her wires with pebbles.
[7:26:12] <SnaKemuho> she's kinda like Sister Friede, gotta keep stuff for the second phase
[7:26:21] <T_sarr> and then the third

[7:28:16] <VRNK> pat forgetting all the game mechanics
[7:28:16] <%MagickBurritoh> It's hard to remember you can jump in a souls game to be fair

[7:28:23] <aimlesshealer> Well at least there's not a big run back
[7:28:24] <KazMkII> Pat learning how 2 Ninja
[7:28:29] <Smaenus> Do combo
[7:28:30] <%ScreamingMeat> It's not Dark Souls Pat, you are allowed to use your items
[7:28:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Is pat tired of being slapped around by granny ninja yet
[7:28:43] <%maskedriderhero> Pat getting his ass handed to him by an old lady
[7:28:58] <SpaceKingVeeg> I'm a big fan of the arm being all counter stuff, from what we know so far.
[7:29:02] <%ElenaManetta> I literally went to work, went home, did some chores, took and nap, and Pat is still streaming
[7:29:04] <%Duskysan> I can't wait to never get past this boss in my own playthough
[7:29:06] <%TheDapperChangeling> Dra-gon-Rot is getting bigger slash, slash, slash, pull my revive trigger.

[7:29:09] <leviathan666303> @AngriestPat press x
[7:29:09] <%Ninestempest> why is pat ALWAYS resurrecting?
[7:29:11] <dildozerfred> Stop resurrecting we’re all getting dragonrot at this point BibleThump
[7:29:12] <%Jpdodds> but of wisdom no clock can measure
[7:29:15] <SnaKemuho> those sweep / thrust are weird
[7:29:17] <Hydrapissed> 死 rot grows 死
[7:29:18] <jamesofn> is the game still under embargo until a certain point?

[7:29:24] <%Plague_Nurse> Why is Pat beating up an old lady
[7:29:25] <waifoong98> @jamesofn nope
[7:29:27] <+IntegratedPaper> Pat drink a sugar free Red Bull, you're not you when you're thirsty

[7:31:50] <dickbuttwoman> So, what happens when you revive too much in this game?
[7:31:56] <silverira> drop your shield
[7:31:58] <%TheDapperChangeling> @dickbuttwoman NPCS get aids.

[7:32:15] <%TheDapperChangeling> Drag-gon-Rot is getting bigger. Slash, slash, slash, pull my revive trigger.
[7:32:18] <dickbuttwoman> @TheDapperChangeling What I meant was, what does that do? Can they die?
[7:32:18] <%starotter70> Know what I mean?
[7:32:21] <%Jpdodds> @ScreamingMeat GaijinGoomba can eat it. This game is made by Japanese people, if they wanna get their own stuff "wrong", fine

[7:34:14] <%ScreamingMeat> @Ner234 He's a guy on youtube that talks about Japanese culture and mythology in video games. One thing he says often in his "Which Ninja" series is that Real Ninja wore blue uniforms and they used Kunai and Shuriken for distraction purposes almost exclusively. And never for killing.

[7:35:12] <Habblewater> Well at least you're killin that first guy real good
[7:35:21] <%Ninestempest> tfw pat gets hit every time by the opening volley
[7:35:22] <%Order_of_Mystery> you know, this is starting to look a bit horseshit. hard for hard's sake, ya know?
[7:35:27] <%Townspoon> @AngriestPat is there somewhere else you can put your cam so we can see your lifebar?
[7:35:27] <%PlainSimpleTailor> From what I'm seeing, the game seems cool, just not fun. Might consider getting a refund before it unlocks on Steam for me
[7:35:28] <Ner234> This granny has no chill LUL
[7:35:32] <%Superstarsage> I wonder if you can light her, and by proxy her wires on fire
[7:35:35] <Deekman> When she summons her ghosts just run all the way to the other end of the arena and she'll recall them
[7:35:49] <Deekman> You don't NEED seeds
[7:35:50] <pshuuu> @EdibleNewb you can delay fighting her a bit but the other bosses arent really any easier
[7:35:53] <SnaKemuho> yeah, maybe kill the horse and get an upgrade
[7:36:01] <%TheDapperChangeling> I keep saying it, this game looks like a hard rent.
[7:36:08] <%ALTRNico> watch your legs LUL
[7:36:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> @plainsimpletailor not fun seems accurate
[7:36:13] <%superb_superbia> I don't know how to feel about this game either @PlainSimpleTailor
[7:36:17] <+Wintermute_VRC> weeeehhh mommy the game is hard I don't like it
[7:36:24] <%afronooch> p much
[7:36:24] <Hydrapissed> Looks fucking great
[7:36:27] <complicatedclarity> the difficulty seems pretty fucked ridiculous
[7:36:27] <%Ninestempest> @TheDapperChangeling yeah like hard to beat in one rent for sure
[7:36:28] <aimlesshealer> Game looks fun to me, but my toaster can't run it
[7:36:41] <+patman22897> @TheDapperChangeling But like....Who rents games?
[7:36:42] <aimlesshealer> What about it looks unfun?
[7:36:43] <%trnzero> I do find it interesting how the first stage "granny" DIES so it resets your rez for stage 2
[7:36:45] <+AXL808> is she just kicking Pat's blade away when he attacks?
[7:36:46] <T_sarr> gameplay looks great but otherwise it feels a bit hollow
[7:36:47] <llamington> its there like a tiny baby mode for infants?
[7:36:48] <%Ninestempest> wait, can you not block sweeps?
[7:36:49] <Hydrapissed> Royal guard the game IM IN!
[7:36:52] <Dragon_Batman> He forgot the enemy step part
[7:36:53] <artoflec> i have a 970 and wasnt sure if i could run it but i got it for ps4 so too late now
[7:36:57] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Maybe go back to the Horse Boss. Perhaps that will help...
[7:36:57] <pshuuu> @aimlesshealer u sure? if you could run ds3, you can run this. it runs really well on pc

[7:38:40] <%Jpdodds> @ScreamingMeat Who cares that shuriken are being potrayed slightly incorrectly when Wolf has a prosthetic arm in the 16th century thats more advanced than modern prosthesis? And fights snake demons? And magic old women? I'm wokring on a history degree and thats a high degree of pedantry even for me
[7:38:44] <%TheDapperChangeling> @Dutchpotato Well, it is Pat, so, like, 4 hours of that is fiddling with the menus, then opening the game.
[7:38:46] <Hydrapissed> POSTURE broken
[7:38:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> she turned her back to him for like 4 seconds

[7:39:28] <+Wintermute_VRC> Wow it's almost like fantasy isn't a thing and just because something has the aesthetic of an older age it MUST be historically accurate. Tell that to Tolkien I guess.
[7:39:36] <%superb_superbia> Are things getting progressively more on fire or is it just me?

[7:43:39] <SeaReally> VTMB 2 yay :')
[7:43:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> I cant kink yhe trailer, search bloodlines 2 on youtube!!!

[7:43:50] <%ScreamingMeat> Where is the trailer for Bloodlines 2 damnit
[7:43:50] <SnaKemuho> too bad Pat is scared to play the pre-patched working GOG version
[7:43:52] <%Superstarsage> Bold Move Cotton!
[7:43:55] <person181> don't know much about the first one thougj
[7:43:57] <%startadevy> LUL vine is coming back?

[7:43:58] <Hydrapissed> Shes mixing it up now

[7:44:09] <%king_wragles> this is a good boss fight
[7:44:10] <%Duskysan> All I can think of is the Berserk 2k16 CLANG
[7:44:12] <+ciprofloxacin> greedy
[7:44:14] <Load_Complete> TRailer was clearly "GAMEPLAY" but it looks very bioshock
[7:44:15] <%TheDapperChangeling> Got it. Thanks guys, will watch the trailer in a bit
[7:44:19] <SunsetJack> I wonder if it skips the first phase of the fight if you use the seed since she is an illusion technically.
[7:44:22] <%PlainSimpleTailor> What if their were some secret way to hook up to her and just stab her to negate the fight LUL
[7:44:23] <arcaderabbit48> Okay fine, maybe it is happening. I just hope it lives up to the hype, and has a smoother dev time than the last game.
[7:44:28] <complicatedclarity> destroy that woman like paige destroys mustard
[7:44:29] <DSD24> I wonder if 2 is going to be modern day

[7:57:33] <+Will_The_Soulless> Pat do you feel like with the difficulty of this that its more a learning curve and understanding controls or does it kinda feel a bit bullshit in some cases?
[7:57:44] <%superb_superbia> I don't use Twitch very often. How does it work?
[7:57:44] <%TheDapperChangeling> Fucking DRK hype
[7:57:45] <kingdudeby> Vampire the Masquerade 2 has been announced.

[7:58:23] <%Salvation122> Yup
[7:58:23] <%starotter70> Yup
[7:58:23] <%TheDapperChangeling> Yep
[7:58:24] <Dragon_Batman> Yea
[7:58:24] <%superb_superbia> yes
[7:58:25] <lizard0tm> Ye
[7:58:25] <aimlesshealer> Absolutely
[7:58:26] <%ElenaManetta> DOZENS of us
[7:58:26] <Omega1180> yes
[7:58:26] <%RageKingDomo> yup
[7:58:28] <+solzan2000> yea
[7:58:28] <%hntronium> HOW MANY DEATHS IS THAT AGAINST LADY BUTTERFLY huh pat
[7:58:28] <%PlainSimpleTailor> yep
[7:58:29] <%Ninestempest> Yup! First is hardest for me!
[7:58:31] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Demon Souls was pretty hard
[7:58:34] <%CreakySkelly> nice
[7:58:35] <lizard0tm> Nah, Bloodborne was the hardest for me
[7:58:35] <lolerez> DOZENS
[7:58:38] <aimlesshealer> This seems like a Souls game made for Souls players
[7:58:38] <majindusto> VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE: BLOODLINES 2 woo!!!
[7:58:39] <%RageKingDomo> that was the hardest lmao
[7:58:39] <%starotter70> Great
[7:58:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Bloodborne is the only one I finished
[7:58:42] <robohorse8000> "Not a souls game"
[7:58:43] <%TheDapperChangeling> Honestly, DS2 was hardest for me, which is weird.
[7:58:44] <Nina96> ds2 first than the rest were fine
[7:58:46] <+Will_The_Soulless> Demons Souls had a lot of problems
[7:58:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Which WoD system is V:tM 2 based off of? Old as "The Masquerade" implies?
[7:58:50] <Dragon_Batman> Demon souls was pretty fucked when I first tried it
[7:58:55] <Neo_Kaiser> Demon Souls wasn't that tough. I beat the first 5 bosses on my first try.
[7:58:55] <+Will_The_Soulless> But some of the parts in Demons Souls are bullshit
[7:58:56] <Habblewater> Yeah kinda...
[7:58:59] <%XzileGaming> the timeline has overlapped
[7:59:02] <dickbuttwoman> The things that make it hard is the jank you don't expect because it's jank
[7:59:11] <+Will_The_Soulless> I hated the dragon at the end of Demons Souls
[7:59:12] <%TheDapperChangeling> DeS was a joke, DS was meh, DS3 was a joke, but then DS2..
[7:59:14] <%hntronium> Nioh?
[7:59:15] <+AngriestAngryArtist> I think Nioh's the hardest shit LOL
[7:59:16] <Run44forrest> DS3 was the hardest for me
[7:59:17] <aimlesshealer> Savor that feeling
[7:59:20] <dickbuttwoman> Like "Will my character stand on that? I don't know"
[7:59:23] <MONSTR_UwU> is this character action now?
[7:59:24] <+AngriestAngryArtist> in higher difficulty is some bullshit
[7:59:30] <sosuke5> Is it a game to make Plauge upset?
[7:59:30] <b9k9com> What is Nioh?
[7:59:34] <%ScreamingMeat> Looks like it plays a lot different from DS and BB but plays similarly enough to fuck with Souls veterans
[7:59:39] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat go back and play Bloodborne right after you finish this game.
[7:59:40] <Nina96> @MONSTR_UwU kinda
[7:59:40] <cavefishes> sekiro unlocks in 9 minutes for me! i'm hype
[7:59:47] <%starotter70> Big tiddy plant girl
[7:59:49] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Nioh is the Team Ninja Equivalent of the souls game.
[7:59:56] <Aji__> If im buying it on one platform, pc for sure?
[8:00:04] <b9k9com> ahhh gotcha, thanks @angriestangryartist
[8:00:05] <MachigattaLT> @AngriestPat any opinions on vampire the masquerade 2 being confirmed?

[8:00:20] <metaphase72> as someone who hasn't been here much, why do you have a picture of steve buscemi in the background?
[8:00:23] <Run44forrest> stopped playing nioh at the second boss that attack that stopped you from moving was bs
[8:00:27] <%Plague_Nurse> To be fair, that's cause you kept dying
[8:00:30] <%TheDapperChangeling> Yeah, I'll definantly rent it, and depending on how it feels, move to a buy
