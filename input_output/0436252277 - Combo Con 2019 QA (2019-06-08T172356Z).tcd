[0:37:41] <dukeamus_prime> Little V, I've been supporting you for a while and I enjoy everything you upload. Anyway, here's my question. What is your favorite song you did a cover for?
[0:41:09] <mistersups> More of a statment. I had a friend listen to Fizz from Guilty Gear, the Character Select theme. He looked at me and said, 'I feel like I gained Knowledge'
