[0:12:43] <%astrauckas> @DKDiamantes No, that is strain. Your characters can go through mental breakdowns.
[0:12:55] <%arthur33344> brb @dkdiamantes gotta take something
[0:14:15] <%SparkyCeasar> @SarahTsang Naaaww
[0:14:22] <+harmlessgs> it can also give you characters that"only heal sanity at church" but are also "cant go to church"
[0:16:11] <dracogiraffa> so you use up attacks to continue after they are dead?
[0:16:22] <%Alex140499> you learn to deal with corpses,it's easyer that it looks
[0:16:49] <%Alex140499> you have atacks that renove all the corpses and shit
[0:16:52] <%astrauckas> Odd... On my screen, you aren't mousing over the actual buttons on the screen...
[0:17:05] <%MoonWatcher21> Yo
[0:17:31] <@Ratmut> that happens at times if resolutions end up not matching
[0:17:35] <@Ratmut> so we see differently
[0:17:42] <%Alex140499> on esc
[0:18:00] <%MoonWatcher21> Losing my mind with the deadlock protocol
[0:18:05] <%MoonWatcher21> you?
[0:18:20] <%Kadett_Lynxx> kadettBoop
[0:18:30] <%Kadett_Lynxx> waking up slowly
[0:19:13] <%Alex140499> theres more things to upgrade
[0:19:27] <%charcoalrhyme88> nice hat
[0:19:36] <%arthur33344> ok i'm back what did i miss?
[0:19:47] <+harmlessgs> "oh look, more bodies"
[0:20:13] <%Alex140499> btw, the stage coatch is one of the most important things on the game
[0:20:27] <@mishmashed> this game is why I started calling my characters dismas
[0:20:42] <@mishmashed> kinda
[0:20:44] <%astrauckas> @DKDiamantes You can't revive.
[0:20:53] <%Alex140499> you can't revive them
[0:20:59] <@mishmashed> it's where you go where your characters die, and you want to look at their graves
[0:21:01] <%Alex140499> only in a super uncommon event
[0:21:59] <@mishmashed> you do you mean your starting on the easier setting on a game that's super punishing and will innevitably tilt you
[0:22:26] <%astrauckas> Good luck...
[0:22:49] <@mishmashed> this game will fuck you
[0:22:50] <%astrauckas> Get the keys
[0:22:57] <%astrauckas> @DKDiamantes I typically bring 10
[0:22:58] <@mishmashed> I'd say like 12
[0:23:05] <%Alex140499> 4 for every check
[0:23:13] <%Alex140499> and at least 8 torches
[0:23:14] <%astrauckas> You'll want 3 torches
[0:23:23] <%flumblum23> Just started the game?
[0:23:40] <ImLemonized> Get at least 1 shovel :D
[0:23:45] <%astrauckas> You'll find a little bit more food and materials in the dungeons as well, but it's uncommon.
[0:24:11] <%Alex140499> for short is good 2 shovels, 8 or more torches, and 1 or 2 keys
[0:24:16] <mortrevenduer1973> @dkdiamantes i found a guide for food and torch for dungeon do you want know the recommed
[0:24:20] <mortrevenduer1973> levels
[0:24:24] <%astrauckas> "Pretty well prepared" Dies before reaching the boss.

[0:24:35] <mortrevenduer1973> ok.. figured i ask
[0:24:36] <@SarahTsang> @mortrevenduer1973 DK will usually figure it out instead of a guiide
[0:24:43] <CavemanDNAGaming> the 2 most important things are food and torches without them bad things happens
[0:25:10] <%Alex140499> after ding horribly a few times he will realise
[0:25:11] <mortrevenduer1973> steamer whow dont use any torches and plays in the dark.. hats off to them
[0:25:11] <%astrauckas> You can also click directly on the map to move as well.
[0:25:59] <%flumblum23> Be aware of things that you pass in the background, Some can be interacted with.
[0:26:08] <mortrevenduer1973> love the guy who is the narrator during thse fights
[0:26:12] <%arthur33344> i saw a youtube video before this it was an r/technically the truth and the thumbnail said "gay people rely on straight people to produce more gay people" LUL they right

[0:29:34] <berserkalucard> really astrauckus? I never noticed
[0:29:43] <%miabyte> had better days but I'm okay
[0:29:53] <%miabyte> hows everyone?
[0:30:01] <LeoDrakoniX> Mia you absolutely beautiful badass babe LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts
[0:30:05] <%flumblum23> That shout reminded me of the guy screaming at the egg.
[0:30:57] <%arthur33344> @miabyte me getting "hey kiiddoed" and i'm not even playing Warframe rn
[0:30:59] <@mishmashed> pretty sure it's more of an ailment heal
[0:31:05] <%astrauckas> 1 hp is great at low level. It gets better
[0:31:07] <@mishmashed> like for blight or summin
[0:31:12] <%Alex140499> btw, enemy damage and crits get higher woth the less the light
[0:31:47] <%H0BBES_> AAAAAAAAAAAAH
[0:31:53] <%miabyte> oh noes
[0:31:54] <@mishmashed> dkdiaLUL
[0:31:55] <%Alex140499> at the same time the loot drops get higher
[0:32:12] <@mishmashed> you can disarm the chat ban
[0:32:22] <@Ratmut> LUL
[0:32:22] <@CephalonStalker> LUL
[0:32:45] <@mishmashed> you click on it with the character you want to attempt to disarm it
[0:33:23] <%flumblum23> Some characters have a better chance at disarm too.
[0:33:23] <%astrauckas> @DKDiamantes If something is not strictly in the background, you can click on it. There was a water fountain in the previous room, for example.
[0:33:39] <%Alex140499> you need to have high lights levels and trigger a scout so you can see traps or have luck and dodge everything
[0:34:07] <%miabyte> So I just bought a $290 vacuum
[0:34:11] <%flumblum23> switch her back
[0:34:17] <@mishmashed> you can also move the dudes
[0:34:30] <%astrauckas> It eats your turn though
[0:35:24] <%miabyte> it was a shark
[0:35:31] <%H0BBES_> Premium succ tho
[0:35:40] <%miabyte> the comparisons say Shark was better
[0:35:41] <@mishmashed> I hope it sucks MiniK
[0:35:56] <%miabyte> Dysons are even more expensive
[0:36:00] <%miabyte> like $500+

[0:36:36] <%astrauckas> If you need room
[0:36:55] <%flumblum23> Change the part order now
[0:37:03] <%miabyte> I saw a thing saying stop buying cheap vacuums because unless they're a sealed system they spread dust and particulate everywhere and break faster
[0:37:19] <berserkalucard> Dysons are definitely worth it.
[0:37:19] <%flumblum23> Well played
[0:37:24] <%Alex140499> you need to use keys for the chests this way you never trigger traps
[0:37:28] <%astrauckas> @miabyte And they only last 6 months.
[0:37:36] <$KatTheMischievous> Heck ferroLurk
[0:37:54] <$KatTheMischievous> Just get a screaming roomba
[0:37:56] <+JBarkey> Yep... heal as much as you can once you have only 1 enemy left @dkdiamantes if you can

[0:38:44] <%KatTheMischievous> @Ratmut woopsD
[0:38:44] <%astrauckas> @KatTheMischievous Anything for the resident Bard who isn't playing the "roll to seduce" archetype
[0:38:55] <%miabyte> it's called a Liftoff duoclean and honestly I'm pumped
[0:39:00] <%KatTheMischievous> woopsSmug
[0:39:01] <@mishmashed> that whole party thing is if they don't eat, they stress
[0:39:07] <+JBarkey> You‚Äôll come to hate kleptomaniac heroes
[0:39:14] <%arthur33344> ahh well
[0:39:15] <%flumblum23> Nicuu!
[0:39:15] <%astrauckas> @DKDiamantes You missed the bossfight :(
[0:39:16] <%charcoalrhyme88> do you think you'll stream this game again?
[0:39:19] <%Alex140499> the food out of the food techs only heals a bit
[0:39:21] <%flumblum23> Home free
[0:39:22] <%miabyte> not cordless unfortunately but honestly recharging batteries and battery life is a massive pita
[0:39:33] <%miabyte> pain in the butt*
[0:39:52] <berserkalucard> I love this game but can only ever get a few hours into it
[0:40:16] <%miabyte> oh nice
[0:40:19] <%miabyte> say hi from me
[0:40:21] <@Ratmut> Im still trying to figure out if I should buy P4G or not f70sThink Never player it, never watched it
[0:40:31] <%astrauckas> Oh fuck, you got Faithless.
[0:40:35] <@Ratmut> played*
[0:40:42] <%miabyte> I played a crossworld randomiser of super metroid / link to the past with roz last night
[0:40:46] <%Alex140499> he eats 1 unit more of food
[0:40:52] <%KatTheMischievous> idk how this works but I assume double, not all
[0:40:57] <%astrauckas> @DKDiamantes Faithless is one of the worst modifiers you can get.
[0:41:01] <%MorningtonCrescent> Oh dear
[0:41:08] <%arthur33344> DBD?? interesting i'll be there
[0:41:10] <berserkalucard> you can just retire the char if they get a really negative quirk
[0:41:16] <%KatTheMischievous> P4G LOOKS SO GOOD UPSCALED AND ALSO IS SO WELL PRICED dv2Gasm
[0:41:31] <@SarahTsang> @arthur33344 they played it a week ago
[0:41:34] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes yeah. Faithless is almost as bad as kleptomaniac.
[0:41:37] <%KatTheMischievous> Its SO well priced
[0:41:37] <@Ratmut> Well, that was a direct answer HahaGingercat
[0:41:52] <%astrauckas> Naoto best girl
[0:41:58] <%astrauckas> Also Persona 3 is best.
[0:42:05] <%KatTheMischievous> Naoto is great
[0:42:06] <%astrauckas> shit, that's a spoiler
[0:42:14] <%arthur33344> @sarahtsang i'll watch this one then
[0:42:17] <+harmlessgs> The best persona game is the most recent one you played and enjoyed
[0:42:22] <%KatTheMischievous> KANJI! FUCKING! TATSUMI!
[0:42:27] <%KatTheMischievous> sofieBless
[0:42:30] <@SarahTsang> =.=
[0:43:05] <%astrauckas> @KatTheMischievous I'll take my Yosuke thanks.
[0:43:17] <%KatTheMischievous> @DKDiamantes P4G has better characters, P5R has better story. Thats my take.
[0:43:20] <+harmlessgs> It is the only dungeon in P3...
[0:43:34] <%KatTheMischievous> @astrauckas Yosuke is an asshole
[0:43:51] <%astrauckas> @KatTheMischievous He's just depressed.
[0:43:56] <%KatTheMischievous> @DKDiamantes Comparing P4 to P5
[0:44:00] <%miabyte> Shadow World is the best song tho
[0:44:10] <%KatTheMischievous> @astrauckas no, hes an asshole in golden
[0:44:15] <%miabyte> I listen to that shit on repeat
[0:44:32] <%miabyte> for real screw P5's soundtrack Shadow World is best song
[0:44:39] <%KatTheMischievous> @miabyte I like the persona intros more personally
[0:44:44] <%KatTheMischievous> P5*
[0:44:52] <+harmlessgs> Story Ryugi gets dumbdumb while Confidant Ryuji is the BRO
[0:45:06] <%astrauckas> Haru has no screen time.
[0:45:17] <%astrauckas> Do not give the demon screen time.
[0:45:17] <%KatTheMischievous> @DKDiamantes they fixed Haru in P5R
[0:45:30] <%KatTheMischievous> I cant say how cuz spoilers

[0:46:11] <%KatTheMischievous> P5 soundtrack is better than P4 imo, but P4 still bops super hard
[0:46:21] <%Alex140499> reduces the black bar

[0:50:22] <%Alex140499> the characters with more than 40 stres is not a good idea to use them on more quests

[0:50:38] <%KatTheMischievous> I stan persona dv2Bless
[0:50:39] <+JBarkey> Antiquarians are strong IF you have heroes who can guard & riposte @dkdiamantes
[0:50:47] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Eyyy, how you enjoying Darkest Dungeon, any character got a heart-attack yet? Kappa
[0:50:53] <@mishmashed> they all auto-sell for a very small sum
[0:51:02] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes All your spare resources are converted back into gold I think, but not much.
[0:51:08] <%MGlBlaze> I'm pretty sure you sell back what you don't use
[0:51:10] <%MGlBlaze> Also hi
[0:51:13] <+JBarkey> @machetephd he just started.
[0:51:13] <%arthur33344> gtg i'll see you in the DBD stream
[0:51:21] <@mishmashed> just remember how many keys you used last time
[0:51:22] <FromThe70s> Blaaaaze
[0:51:23] <%miabyte> hi blaze
[0:51:24] <%SparkyCeasar> Hiya Blaze
[0:51:26] <@Ratmut> Blaaaaaaaaaze
[0:51:28] <@mishmashed> !follow @MGlBlaze
[0:51:28] <@CephalonStalker> The Cult of DK DEMANDS that you follow mglblaze at http://www.twitch.tv/mglblaze !
[0:51:36] <%MGlBlaze> mglblaLove
[0:51:54] <+JBarkey> I‚Äôm about to offer you the worst advice @dkdiamantes
[0:52:11] <%MGlBlaze> Ratmut and Mishmashed's names are blurred for me for some reason and this bothers me LUL
[0:52:48] <+JBarkey> Bring only 1 torch. Use it only with a curio that demands a ‚Äúsacrifice of light‚Äù.
[0:52:49] <@SarahTsang> @MGlBlaze They REFUSE to change the colour of their names
[0:52:49] <%MGlBlaze> "Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer."
[0:52:55] <@mishmashed> just think of me as somebody really far away
[0:52:58] <+JBarkey> rialuvsBEvil
[0:53:04] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes If you wanna make shit more entertaining, one thing I've seen other people do is re-name the in-game heroes to the names of their friends / people in chat. Just imagine, you can watch Ratmut get beaten by skeletons! Kappa
[0:53:21] <@mishmashed> @SarahTsang YEAH, BECAUSE WE RAD berdboHat
[0:53:31] <+Digressive> Hey all :)
[0:53:38] <chell_cake> hello there! how many times has DK died?
[0:54:01] <@mishmashed> @Digressive howdy dkdiaHey
[0:54:05] <%MGlBlaze> OOF
[0:54:08] <+JBarkey> @chell_cake this appears to be his second dungeon
[0:54:09] <FromThe70s> woooooow
[0:54:12] <MachetePhD> He can be saved by RNG
[0:54:21] <%Dracael006> Hiya peeps
[0:54:25] <@mishmashed> but DK, then it means you went be sad when mishmashed dies
[0:54:38] <%MGlBlaze> Also at early levels, your characters will tend to die a lot. Only after they get experience do they become more capable of surviving.
[0:54:43] <+Digressive> quiettTea quiettTea
[0:54:46] <%flumblum23> Oh no
[0:54:50] <MachetePhD> What difficulty is he on?
[0:54:51] <chell_cake> oh well let's just wait then
[0:55:07] <%Alex140499> spiders are assholes in this game!
[0:55:17] <%MGlBlaze> Iwiwiwiwiwiwiwiw-
[0:55:17] <%MorningtonCrescent> are you running the weeb mods?
[0:55:23] <chell_cake> easy is still difficult lol
[0:55:29] <%Alex140499> they killed my healer 9000 times on one turn
[0:55:30] <%MGlBlaze> I think I must have given you my speech impediment
[0:55:38] <MachetePhD> Spiders are indeed assholes. Basically any enemy with high dodge can fuck right off.
[0:56:12] <MachetePhD> Yeah, even in easy, Darkest Dungeon's RNG can be really punishing.
[0:56:14] <%flumblum23> In any case the beginning of this game is somewhat of a slog
[0:56:17] <%MGlBlaze> I actually played this game a bunch. I got pretty far and then kinda stopped.
[0:56:22] <%Alex140499> @machetephd high dodge and high speed are the worst
[0:56:35] <%Alex140499> but spiders makes some really painfull crits
[0:56:40] <%PasiveO_o> Hi everyone
[0:56:52] <@SarahTsang> Hi passive
[0:57:03] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes you‚Äôre going to be saying that a lot, ‚Äústop targeting him, I just healed him‚Äù rialuvsBEvil rialuvsBEvil rialuvsBEvil
[0:57:05] <%flumblum23> You need a camp to do that.
[0:57:07] <@mishmashed> @PasiveO_o dkdiaHey
[0:57:17] <%SparkyCeasar> Pasive!
[0:57:47] <+JBarkey> Nice!
[0:57:51] <%MGlBlaze> Yeah, don't down food as a heal TOO much. Otherwise you won't have enough food for camp and you'll suffer for it.
[0:58:16] <@SarahTsang> @DKDiamantes sorry, i'm lurking because *obvious answer about what you think i will say*
[0:58:23] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes I find this game to be a very accurate depiction of 2020. It's just non-stop STRESS PROCS
[0:59:10] <%MGlBlaze> How you can poison a skeleton, I'm not sure
[0:59:35] <@Ratmut> SARAH STOP FLEXING

[1:00:44] <%flumblum23> Oof the puns
[1:01:01] <%MGlBlaze> ANyone can try
[1:01:04] <+Digressive> yo @SarahTsang HeyGuys
[1:01:23] <%Alex140499> you can look the change on the icon on the health
[1:01:24] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Each character has a different %chance to disarm traps, I think it says it somewhere on their character sheet.
[1:01:29] <%Alex140499> chance*
[1:01:33] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes everyone can try, some are better than others
[1:01:59] <%flumblum23> "Hansom reward"
[1:02:06] <+JBarkey> Highwayman and grave robbers are better iirc @dkdiamantes

[1:02:32] <MachetePhD> The fucking Crusader in full armour is the one who gets cut trying to open a door tacKek
[1:02:36] <%PasiveO_o> Having fun DK, I hated my first 10h of darkest dungeon LUL
[1:02:56] <%MGlBlaze> The game has sweet music, too.
[1:03:17] <@Ratmut> etainREE @PasiveO_o
[1:03:23] <MachetePhD> The atmosphere of this game is sooo good. The narration also really fucking helps
[1:03:24] <+Digressive> I really like the narrator
[1:03:26] <%MGlBlaze> Yeah the art style is very distinct. Strong shading with all eyes obscured by shadow.
[1:03:33] <+JBarkey> Darkest dungeon is best Cthulhu-sequel game ever. rialuvsParty1 rialuvsParty1 rialuvsParty1
[1:03:46] <@mishmashed> it's got everything, art, sound, gameplay, copious amounts of stress
[1:03:48] <+JBarkey> *-esque
[1:03:57] <flumblum23> Them crossbow skeletons SUCK.
[1:04:11] <%Alex140499> thats why you kill fisrt the ballista guys
[1:04:13] <+harmlessgs> wasnt this the easiest difficulty?
[1:04:28] <chell_cake> yes
[1:04:30] <FromThe70s> @PasiveO_o Do you normally play games you hate for that long? LUL
[1:04:36] <MachetePhD> RNG is, and always will be a bitch in Darkest Dungeon. No matter the difficulty tacKek
[1:04:37] <+JBarkey> @harmlessgs darkest dungeon be like that. rialuvsBEvil rialuvsBEvil rialuvsBEvil
[1:04:53] <%flumblum23> They realized who the healer is lol
[1:05:06] <%PasiveO_o> @fromthe70s it was a love/hate relationship
[1:05:09] <%MGlBlaze> I think the crusader can have a heal too
[1:05:27] <%Alex140499> the thing is, i played alot on stygian and the damage bumbers feel really low to me LUL
[1:05:53] <%MGlBlaze> ...She's a healer, DK
[1:06:00] <%flumblum23> You say that now DK...
[1:06:07] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Yeah but you'll see they have a debuff from even entering Death's Door in the first place.
[1:06:17] <%MGlBlaze> No?
[1:06:17] <$Naiture> hai DK!
[1:06:21] <%MGlBlaze> Where did you get that idea.
[1:06:34] <%MGlBlaze> LUL
[1:06:34] <@CephalonStalker> LUL
[1:06:39] <%Alex140499> you forgot the chest
[1:06:49] <MachetePhD> I think even if you heal them, if they ever hit Death's Door once, they get a debuff that lasts the rest of the mission. I think it gives them increased stress, and lower max HP?
[1:07:10] <%Alex140499> @machetephd lowers everything a bit
[1:07:11] <%flumblum23> Cheer100 PogChamp100 Cheer100

[1:09:34] <@Ratmut> NAITURE etainREE
[1:09:35] <%MGlBlaze> Yeah battle heal, I was right
[1:09:38] <%MGlBlaze> It's pretty handy
[1:09:44] <$Naiture> RATMUT etainREE
[1:09:54] <$Naiture> etainHeart
[1:09:59] <MachetePhD> Yeah but it only heals 1 tacKek
[1:10:01] <%MGlBlaze> It's a party heal. But it's only 1.
[1:10:05] <%MGlBlaze> So it's a VERY weak heal.
[1:10:12] <+JBarkey> Stress healing is AMAZING
[1:10:24] <%MGlBlaze> Oh yeah, that's true.
[1:10:31] <MachetePhD> Well thing about Darkest Dungeon, is that it's not always beneficial to have your torch light. It's a risk/reward system.
[1:10:36] <%MGlBlaze> The stress heal is probably the important bit.
[1:10:56] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes even if it‚Äôs 1 hp, if you get them off deaths door it‚Äôs great!
[1:11:10] <%MGlBlaze> You can only pick four per excusion, by the way
[1:11:21] <%MGlBlaze> Okay
[1:11:52] <MachetePhD> Torch-light is a very risk-reward system in this. The lower your light is, your accuracy dips, and you take more stress damage, but your crit chance increases (but so does the enemy's) and you find more loot.
[1:12:09] <MachetePhD> So having your torch at 100 isn't always a good thing

[1:16:10] <%PasiveO_o> @sarahtsang again?
[1:16:34] <%Njyor> @SarahTsang congrats
[1:17:19] <MachetePhD> Well you have a Plague Doc with the debuff-heal, right? She can remove blight and bleed
[1:17:19] <%Alex140499> don't forget to use the keys
[1:17:21] <%flumblum23> SLUUUURP
[1:17:44] <dioboie> i thought u will be farming waterfalls for The Tenets Fragments
[1:18:03] <@SarahTsang> @PasiveO_o no, this is the first time, and it's hilarious , coz it's fucking shit still hahah
[1:18:10] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes That's because Reynauld is a kleptomaniac tacKek

[1:18:36] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes whistling means he‚Äôs stealing from you - kleptomaniac quirk
[1:18:40] <%Alex140499> @flumblum23 yep, he always does
[1:18:52] <%flumblum23> Oof
[1:18:53] <%PasiveO_o> @sarahtsang oops, I forgot that terraforming unlocks with 3* a d not 5*, congrats!!!!
[1:19:42] <icycurves69> this game is bullshit
[1:20:06] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Basically heroes with the kleptomaniac quirk have a % chance to automatically loot interactable items they pass, and they keep it for themselves rather than it going to your inventory.
[1:20:06] <icycurves69> i lose my team to a team of spiders
[1:20:19] <%Alex140499> plague mommy us really good
[1:20:23] <%Alex140499> is*
[1:20:38] <icycurves69> LUL
[1:20:38] <@CephalonStalker> LUL
[1:20:39] <MachetePhD> Yeah. Plague Doc is great, she has a lot of utility (like curing bleed and blight)
[1:21:01] <icycurves69> why plague doc when you can stock up better
[1:21:17] <%Alex140499> @machetephd making a just stun based plague doc is great
[1:21:42] <icycurves69> stun is cool and all but it does nothing
[1:21:58] <icycurves69> maybe i just dont understand how it works
[1:22:03] <MachetePhD> Buff his damage, he misses every shot. Classic Darkest Dungeon tacKek
[1:22:04] <%Alex140499> thats why you have the 3 other charactera
[1:22:54] <%Alex140499> thats why later on i ended up loving the death mark mechanic, makes some juccy hits
[1:23:07] <%Dracael006> dewit
[1:23:16] <%flumblum23> Hmm
[1:24:20] <%flumblum23> Those little guys stress your part so much.
[1:24:23] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Also just something to remember: You can retreat from combat and the dungeon itself entirely if you're really worried about losing a character you want to keep. But it inflicts a stress toll on the entire party.

[1:29:19] <MachetePhD> To a degree.
[1:30:26] <+JBarkey> Stressed heroes are randomly affected. They might act out, or they might refuse to act, or refuse other heroes actions, all depends @dkdiamantes
[1:30:36] <shadowlurker4897> you are so low on food
[1:30:39] <%flumblum23> Some characters can do stress relief during camping.
[1:30:45] <MachetePhD> There's like a dozen different Afflictions (Paranoid, Abusive, Hopeless, etc). Each one effects a hero in a different way. A hero who is Paranoid might refuse being healed because they don't trust their allies, for example. But RNG is always at the core of this stuff. There's a chance they might refuse, a chance they might not.
[1:31:08] <shadowlurker4897> drop the yellow citrines, they are the only thing that stacks less than gold

[1:38:13] <MachetePhD> Yeah I really don't understand why walking IN THE DIRECTION THEY JUST CAME FROm stresses them out. Like they just passed by, they know there are no enemies that way LUL
[1:38:24] <%Dracael006> it's quite litterally 'Go hard or go home!' lol
[1:38:42] <%Alex140499> i would personaly leave, they are going to horribly die

[1:41:06] <+Raethran> Leper teaRU
[1:41:09] <MachetePhD> Hey look, this Crusader isn't a kleptomaniac Kappa
[1:41:43] <shadowlurker4897> One good tip is healing characters costs money, throwing them out is free
[1:41:50] <%Alex140499> ocultist is a wierd debuf-healer-dps
[1:41:58] <+JBarkey> There‚Äôs very little you can do to heal stress during dungeons.
[1:42:16] <+Raethran> I would suggest upgrading the stage coach before tossing out heroes
[1:42:40] <MachetePhD> Leper is the BIG STRONK
[1:42:43] <shadowlurker4897> 3 heroes each week is enough
[1:42:45] <%Alex140499> leper is a tank-dps with really bad acuarcy
[1:43:00] <%flumblum23> He's a secondary knight p much
[1:43:08] <%Alex140499> i love the buff the leper comp
[1:43:28] <%flumblum23> Check the health?
[1:43:29] <%Alex140499> both are great
[1:43:30] <+Raethran> both would be good
[1:43:42] <%Alex140499> the leper has shit accuarcy
[1:43:51] <+JBarkey> Yes, use the leper rialuvsBEvil rialuvsBEvil rialuvsBEvil
[1:43:53] <%flumblum23> Hmm
[1:44:07] <+Raethran> Crusader is actually really good in the back line, but that requires a specific team comp
[1:44:13] <%Alex140499> look on the atack itself
[1:44:27] <shadowlurker4897> lepers base accuracy is 75 if the enemy has dodge oh well
[1:44:37] <+Raethran> So crusader backline and leper front line
[1:45:08] <%Alex140499> crusader is great with a shieldbreaker with HOLY LANCE
[1:45:20] <+Raethran> But again, specific team comp, don't worry about it right now if you don't want to
[1:45:44] <+Raethran> nope
[1:45:50] <%Alex140499> i personaly think that all the classes are pretty great
[1:45:51] <+Raethran> Check reynaulds quirks
[1:46:04] <shadowlurker4897> raynold is godfearing

[1:54:50] <%Alex140499> you really felt the 75 acuarcy on that one?
[1:54:57] <+Raethran> also the torch affect enemies crits :P
[1:55:07] <@SarahTsang> @0Alyx0 *waves*
[1:55:11] <%Alex140499> i love seeing people play this game for the first game
[1:55:23] <+Dzaka> color was orange.. it was low
[1:55:30] <%Alex140499> it was low dk,lower than 50 is really low
[1:55:48] <@Ratmut> This is a game I couldn't see myself play LUL
[1:56:02] <%flumblum23> Try creeping the crusader up a bit
[1:56:14] <%Alex140499> @ratmut it's easyer than it looks when you get the hang of it
[1:56:27] <MachetePhD> They announced Darkest Dungeon 2 last year I think it ws? But they haven't yet given any new info as far as I know
[1:56:31] <@KuramaAi94> this game is too stress inducing to me Kappa
[1:56:46] <%Alex140499> the first time is always a f* masacre LUL
[1:57:02] <+Dzaka> @Ratmut think of it as playing a dungeons and dragons campaign.. but the DM is a psychotic dick
[1:57:29] <MachetePhD> Leper is basically a walking d20. He either misses and is of no use, or absolutely DEMOLISHES the enemy with the highest numbers you've ever seen tacKek
[1:57:48] <%flumblum23> Yes DK, easy mose on STRESS: THE VIDEOGAME
[1:58:01] <%Alex140499> @machetephd unless you buff it to death
[1:58:04] <shadowlurker4897> easy mode only effects town upgrade cost, not actual combat
[1:58:12] <%0Alyx0> would yall believe me if i said im most sad about losing 1 particular minecraft save?
[1:58:13] <@KuramaAi94> @Dzaka thats a reason to drop the campaign though and not join
[1:58:38] <%Alex140499> @shadowlurker4897 i think it afects slightly enemy health
[1:59:11] <+Raethran> Leper with best girl plague doctor is a fun combo
[1:59:16] <%Alex140499> doesn't it?
[1:59:19] <+Dzaka> you don't have a thief. that's why you can't see the traps
[1:59:23] <+Raethran> And you can only see the traps if they have been scouted out
[1:59:41] <%flumblum23> Fair enough
[1:59:49] <%Alex140499> @raethran vestal, jester, doc, leper is great
[2:00:02] <%Alex140499> super acuarte and buffed to death lepper

[2:01:31] <MachetePhD> Ohboy, Abomination tacKek
[2:01:42] <%Alex140499> jester is the best anti-stress character in the game
[2:01:57] <+JBarkey> Jester is a weird class to new players, but a jester 1-shouted final boss in a VOD.
[2:02:32] <%Alex140499> abomination is prettu good
[2:02:34] <+Raethran> abomination is pretty fun
[2:02:34] <%0Alyx0> anyway wish me luck getting my steam games back
[2:02:39] <+Raethran> not the best but fun
[2:02:42] <+Dzaka> abomination is great.. in some situations
[2:02:50] <%0Alyx0> didnt lose the account but download times are going to kill me
[2:02:54] <MachetePhD> He is a really interesting character, but he can also be punishing to your party if not handled properly
[2:02:57] <%Alex140499> i like it even with a non trasformation based comp
[2:03:15] <%0Alyx0> @DKDiamantes my biggest download fear rn is actually pso2 bc i didnt have issues the first time but ya know
[2:03:18] <%Alex140499> btw, houndmaster is a GREAT dps
[2:03:37] <%Alex140499> and pairs really well with ocultist and the marking mechanic
[2:03:52] <+Dzaka> i have a skin that turns houndmaster into shaggy and his dog into scooby doo

[2:05:06] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Can I give some advice for upgrading?
[2:05:17] <+Dzaka> get gems and stuff in a dungeon
[2:05:30] <+Raethran> yes you can!
[2:05:33] <%Alex140499> dk do you want to know about the evil CEO trick?
[2:05:37] <+Raethran> you can sell trinkets
[2:05:41] <shadowlurker4897> you can see trinkets with shift click
[2:05:44] <MachetePhD> Yeah, you can sell trinkets. I think you shift+click them
[2:06:12] <%Alex140499> it's not a cheese thing, you just will feel like an asshole CEO to your characters
[2:06:21] <+Raethran> But I would advise a torchless run. Throw bodies into a pitch black dungeon. Not all will return but you can get some good loot.
[2:06:40] <+Dzaka> take the lowby characters to a lowby dungeon to level
[2:07:21] <%Alex140499> you can always mix it up if you want to feel confortable with everybody easyer
[2:08:08] <%Alex140499> or choose short misions for noobies
[2:10:06] <%Alex140499> ow, that button does that?

[2:11:20] <%Alex140499> thats a really juccy map

[2:28:48] <MachetePhD> I think the main benefit of the Antiquarian, as far as I remember, is that she helps you earn more money / loot during a mission?
[2:28:49] <+Raethran> NICE
[2:28:53] <MachetePhD> YO, VIRTUOUS
[2:29:06] <%MoonWatcher21> I wish someone could give me sanity
[2:29:25] <+Dzaka> yeah he rolled a san check and had a positive crit
[2:29:40] <+Raethran> and this is the shitty part of spiders
[2:29:46] <+JBarkey> Yes @machetephd , but if someone can riposte, use the antiquarian to funnel more enemies into your riposte character with ‚Äòguard me‚Äô.
[2:29:50] <MachetePhD> He can, BUT HE'S STUNNED
[2:29:54] <+Raethran> they all focus down one target
[2:30:14] <+Raethran> monkaS monkaS monkaS
[2:30:15] <+Dzaka> i fear shaggy and scoob are about to bite it
[2:30:26] <+Raethran> that was a good play actually
[2:30:32] <+Raethran> give them a different target
[2:30:43] <+Raethran> nvm....

[3:08:47] <ElenaManetta> is that Friday the 13th online game still alive?
[3:08:48] <%miabyte> What a waste
[3:08:53] <ElenaManetta> Or did DBD kill it
[3:09:00] <@SarahTsang> @ElenaManetta pretty sure it's still alive
[3:09:09] <goombella> People play it a little
[3:09:26] <+JBarkey> @elenamanetta it‚Äôs dead, but it was killed by licensing rights legal fight, not cause of dbd
[3:09:49] <@mishmashed> one thing I never got was this game being scary, like, is it just me or????
[3:10:04] <goombella> I think it's really tense!
[3:10:07] <%miabyte> so tempted to redownload this game
[3:10:11] <%miabyte> I think i played it once
[3:10:22] <%miabyte> @Roz_Lynd should I give this a go?
[3:10:26] <@SarahTsang> @mishmashed it was never meant to be scary i don't think aha
[3:10:27] <imajoker6> @dkdiamantes use dead hard it‚Äôs really good
[3:10:27] <goombella> If you allow yourself to really immerse in it, it can be scary.
[3:10:31] <@mishmashed> I just found it funny running around the killer
[3:10:34] <NekoZen> it stops being scary 5 minutes in
[3:10:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> I want all of you to play Warzone together. The chaos would be AMAZING
[3:10:45] <NekoZen> then turns into a salt fest yelling at survivors and killers
[3:10:48] <goombella> 400 hours babyyyy
[3:10:54] <morningmoondude> pat says that about all the toxic games he plys
[3:10:57] <ElenaManetta> this game flares up my competitiveness to the max that it's shocking paige can play it because i know she's super competitive, or she says she is

[3:17:47] <morningmoondude> stressed balls wll make the pee in them tart
[3:18:03] <+abrupt_abe> So is this the first time killer Pat gone against survivor Paige?
[3:18:08] <@mishmashed> NotLikeThis
[3:18:09] <+worldbrand> paige has the biggest nuts
[3:18:11] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:18:11] <@CephalonStalker> LUL
[3:18:18] <ElenaManetta> wow pat would make for a really good serial killer, glad the psych degree worked out
[3:18:36] <$norgthefish> Hows popin Pat
[3:19:03] <+kyh9> What's your favorite killers to go up against?
[3:19:12] <+kyh9> Also, does Technician actually work now?
[3:19:28] <%Midashu> this game is almost over
[3:19:28] <ElenaManetta> imagine a movie where the killer and victim argue
[3:19:36] <+worldbrand> he's waiting for pyramid head to drop and then he will splurge
[3:19:45] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Think of Bloodpoints like DBD's version of Endo
[3:19:47] <ElenaManetta> YEAH
[3:19:58] <ElenaManetta> i have a 5% chance of playing the game if i can actually play as heather
[3:20:05] <+worldbrand> from what i have heard he's decent but not OP
[3:20:23] <MachetePhD> I mean Pyramid-Head has the ability to attack through walls. So he's got a lot of mindfuckery potential
[3:20:42] <ElenaManetta> that was a cool escape
[3:20:55] <%SparkyCeasar> I have acquired Munches
[3:20:58] <$norgthefish> Wow Roz
[3:21:04] <+worldbrand> sounds like higher skill floor and ceiling then
[3:21:06] <MachetePhD> Nurse is considered the hardest character to master, but one of the strongest in the entire game if you play her right
[3:21:27] <+kyh9> Demogorgon is pretty fun if you figure out how to abuse the portals
[3:21:33] <$norgthefish> Roz misses as nurse like CEO's Taxes
[3:21:34] <%MorningtonCrescent> DK now needs new pants
[3:21:35] <morningmoondude> don't worry, dk, Pat isn't real
[3:21:36] <+Glitchesarecool> twitch making me sit through a stupid ad before I get to watch my favorite ginger streamer playing
[3:21:37] <ElenaManetta> another cool escape!
[3:21:49] <+kyh9> Who's the killer, Pat?
[3:22:00] <$norgthefish> Brave little DK ran
[3:22:04] <@SarahTsang> @MachetePhD Playing DbD basically shows how lost i really get more than any other game...
[3:22:28] <ElenaManetta> they were talking about IRL
[3:22:37] <MachetePhD> @SarahTsang Sounds about right tacKek
[3:22:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> Killer is so much better
[3:22:51] <+kyh9> Ironically, Paige is the one who kills Pat in real life
[3:22:52] <+worldbrand> Pat's amazing at killing people, also he's pretty okay at playing killer in this game
[3:23:10] <+Glitchesarecool> Pat's gonna cook up some tasty flesh tonight
[3:23:14] <%MoonWatcher21> "It depends on ball sacks"
[3:23:16] <%MoonWatcher21> huh
[3:23:18] <+Glitchesarecool> i'm also glitches
[3:23:19] <%MoonWatcher21> good to know
[3:23:21] <PirateMike_> Hi Pat&Paige
[3:23:26] <+kyh9> Do you guys have a favorite killer to go up against as Survivor?
[3:23:43] <@mishmashed> DK, I don't know how to telll you this, but screenlooking isn't hacking
[3:23:50] <%Midashu> Don't worry Pat, DK isn't doing anything
[3:23:50] <PirateMike_> "The Business"
[3:23:55] <%MorningtonCrescent> Where's the toxicity?

[3:25:18] <@mishmashed> I feel like I should re-install this game

[3:25:53] <@SarahTsang> relationship goals
[3:26:02] <PirateMike_> Too healthy some would say
[3:26:06] <%miabyte> watch DK die within the next 2 minutes
[3:26:09] <ElenaManetta> DK literally has main hero immunity
[3:26:23] <+Glitchesarecool> well she finally enabled him to cook because her back exploded

[3:32:19] <cochramd1992> so is Pat playing killer, or is everyone survivor?
[3:32:24] <ElenaManetta> has anyone remarked that dk's killer looks like paige in a post-apocalypse movie
[3:32:26] <PirateMike_> Did you know Country music used to be called Hillbilly ?
[3:32:30] <+ararebeast> If it's a Billy you'll usually hear that it's Billy in the first 5 seconds anyway
[3:32:31] <ElenaManetta> she would be the "tinkerer" character
[3:32:57] <$norgthefish> well since my PC busted a big bong I decided to spend that time watching shit on Netflix. Dorohedoro. its fucking good can't wait for S2. Kipo S2 Forced gay relatonship flew over higher than Satelite. and second half of S4 of Rick&Morty E6 was the shit

[3:36:43] <%miabyte> I can not say. i don't wish to bring attention to it and restart the harrassment
[3:36:44] <@SarahTsang> hahahah
[3:36:45] <@Ratmut> LUL
[3:36:51] <+ararebeast> Just 4% off the hook it'll be fine
[3:36:52] <%Midashu> Pat is the cruelest teacher
[3:36:57] <+NitronStreams> LUL
[3:36:58] <%MorningtonCrescent> I vote Pat has to be survivor
[3:37:02] <$norgthefish> and good
[3:37:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:37:02] <cochramd1992> the best way to learn the game is to be repeatedly stomped at it
[3:37:03] <%miabyte> It feels like DK is the little borther in this situation.
[3:37:07] <%miabyte> brother*
[3:37:07] <ElenaManetta> pat believes in teaching on the job
[3:37:10] <NekoZen> pat should pick someone relatively slower
[3:37:10] <+NitronStreams> first lesson: git gud
[3:37:13] <jestrfestr> he is really random killers have no mercy either LUL
[3:37:15] <NekoZen> maybe michael or ghostface
[3:37:18] <$norgthefish> No feeding trolls in this house. exept me
[3:37:20] <%SparkyCeasar> Its a certain type of teaching method called TRIAL BY FIRE
[3:37:30] <PirateMike_> Best way to learn is through trails and tribulations
[3:37:41] <cochramd1992> the *superior* older brother
[3:37:48] <theshillman> paige nee-san <3
[3:37:58] <+ararebeast> You don't have to rapid mash you just have to keep it steady, but sometimes it'll jank up and kill you anyway
[3:38:04] <ElenaManetta> there's still way no to vote on a map or pick one before the game starts?
[3:38:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Paige got you off?
[3:38:09] <PirateMike_> Pat is the supreme gamer
[3:38:24] <ElenaManetta> GO DK
[3:38:25] <+ararebeast> @ElenaManetta You can get maps by burning specific offerings
[3:38:30] <ElenaManetta> OH GOD
[3:38:39] <ElenaManetta> Oh interesting
[3:38:51] <ElenaManetta> HOW DOES PAT KNOW
[3:38:56] <ElenaManetta> oh is it the blood drips
[3:39:10] <+ararebeast> The survivors leave scratch marks when they sprint and if they're injured they leave blood too
[3:39:12] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes So Paige is pretty much the older sister who acts like a 2nd mum, and then there's Pat who would be that type of older brother that tricks you into lying next to an anthill while you have honey over your face? Kappa
[3:39:19] <+kyh9> Hide, you coward
[3:39:20] <NekoZen> DK is sprinting
[3:39:31] <@mishmashed> dude, why are you running, he said he's not going to hit you MiniK
[3:39:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Sure pat sure

[3:40:11] <@SarahTsang> ded
[3:40:16] <ElenaManetta> that whole chase was so stressful
[3:40:23] <PirateMike_> Run straight into him why dont you
[3:40:47] <ElenaManetta> See that chase is why I can't play the game, cause I would feel like, "BUT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME RUNNING AWAY, LET ME WIN FUCK!!!"
[3:41:10] <$norgthefish> rbzDNF
[3:41:15] <NekoZen> well if you are doing a good job
[3:41:25] <NekoZen> other survivors should be fixing generators
[3:41:39] <%SparkyCeasar> That was comical XD
[3:41:52] <ElenaManetta> This map seems like it's a bad idea to be together
[3:41:58] <$norgthefish> they fix it faster when working together
[3:42:05] <PirateMike_> Well coordinated team in dead by daylight Kappa
[3:42:11] <@SarahTsang> @ElenaManetta i hate how closed in this map is

[3:44:22] <MachetePhD> To be fair, doesn't Legion's power let him see where all the other survivors are if he hits one with his Frenzy, it shows an icon where all the others are for a split second?
[3:44:22] <@SarahTsang> LOL
[3:44:23] <PirateMike_> Rude
[3:44:37] <+worldbrand> It's like how deer wait for predators to get close before running

[3:45:40] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes I have the feeling you'd both love and hate Spirit. Love her because of the design and lore, hate her because she's a nightmare to play against tacKek
[3:45:49] <%MorningtonCrescent> But I enjoy the game by torturing DK
[3:46:00] <Joustar_> oh no

[3:46:49] <$norgthefish> also it looks fun that DK's PC can't do foregin letters
[3:46:50] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> So are they all playing humans together, is someone playing the killer?
[3:46:55] <smartiger117> Is killer first person?

[3:54:44] <PirateMike_> The killer need encouraging words
[3:54:47] <+xmetalicdemonx> If he's new how does he have all these perks already?
[3:54:48] <+chowdah101> Just do the thing :)
[3:54:52] <+raypoint_223> Page should be really good as killer if the survivors are all the lady types...or pregnant.

[4:12:32] <%Darkmega97> as long as Paige doesn't start sundowning, we'll be fine
[4:12:32] <ElenaManetta> This game has... so many... mechanics..
[4:12:57] <ElenaManetta> this map needs to be removed from the game
[4:12:59] <ElenaManetta> nobody likes this game
[4:13:00] <Solidnick18> oh
[4:13:12] <ElenaManetta> this is DBD's "TC_Hydro"
[4:13:19] <+JBarkey> Oh leries! It‚Äôs a lovely map
[4:13:24] <crazypsico55> What do totems do?
[4:13:24] <Starotter70> Is Freddy actually Sonic?
[4:13:25] <MachetePhD> So because I just saw an ad for it pop up a second ago- I wonder what it would be like if DBD ever added a Clicker from Last Of Us d69Think
[4:13:55] <ElenaManetta> This map did not look like this a year ago though, right
[4:13:56] <SoFarFetched> I think the ash has to do with Freddy?
[4:13:57] <+kyh9> No, that's Freddy specific I think
[4:13:57] <ElenaManetta> I'm not crazy
[4:13:58] <%thespianhunter> fast fast fast - gotta step on the gas
[4:14:01] <theshillman> its fine
[4:14:02] <@SarahTsang> @MachetePhD or a bloater
[4:14:04] <MachetePhD> I think the ash is part of Freddy's passive
[4:14:11] <ElenaManetta> This map was super brightly lit before
[4:14:24] <Solidnick18> oh boy
[4:14:27] <SoFarFetched> I guess this place wasn't so lit after all
[4:14:31] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes the fog is often present, and players can use items to thicken or reduce it.
[4:14:31] <ElenaManetta> WHAT
[4:14:31] <+NitronStreams> 1, 2, Paige is coming for you.
[4:14:32] <ElenaManetta> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
[4:14:40] <ElenaManetta> WOW

[4:14:50] <%olilink2002> omg what are the chance
[4:14:53] <ElenaManetta> i love this game now
[4:14:53] <Starotter70> LUL
[4:15:09] <MachetePhD> @SarahTsang I wanted to say that too, but I feel a Bloater might be a bit much considering how huge they are, and the fact their ability to just throw pods that release spore-clouds might be a bit too similar to the Clown.
[4:15:11] <Solidnick18> LUL
[4:15:12] <%SparkyCeasar> I know its not really horror but I would Love to see Alex Mercer in this
[4:15:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[4:15:21] <%miabyte> hey dk, as a lore whore do you have any dbd lore theories?
[4:15:54] <ElenaManetta> that guy just shoved DK for heals
[4:16:03] <SoFarFetched> Watch Paige accidentally smacks pat forgetting who he was playing LUL
[4:16:05] <%miabyte> I always thought the game was purgatory
[4:16:23] <+JBarkey> They have ‚Äúcertain areas‚Äù and the game chooses a selection of the spots to use each game @dkdiamantes
[4:16:27] <+NitronStreams> 3, 4, better lock your door.
[4:16:31] <MachetePhD> It both sorta is, and isn't
[4:16:40] <TeEmeraE> you eventually go into the dream
[4:16:43] <@SarahTsang> god the sounds...
[4:16:44] <+JBarkey> So gens a random, within a selection of possibles.
[4:16:49] <+Mendin> The map is randomly generated out of pre-made chunks
[4:16:51] <TeEmeraE> its a timer thing
[4:16:56] <SoFarFetched> "KNIFE to meet you"
[4:17:05] <MachetePhD> @miabyte Mind if I throw out my current understanding of the DBD universe lore?
[4:17:10] <ElenaManetta> So disarming that removes Paige's perks or what
[4:17:16] <%miabyte> sure
[4:17:43] <%miabyte> also I wanna hear Pat and Paige's theories
[4:18:03] <SoFarFetched> she would
[4:18:12] <ElenaManetta> The hero's strategy is to wait by the door until your friends activate the generators
[4:18:43] <+Mendin> Ah, the F13 trick of hanging by the car/dock and just slipping in
[4:18:47] <ElenaManetta> See like that right there, did Paige activate dream world or does it just happen randomly
[4:18:48] <+NitronStreams> 5, 6, get your crucifix.
[4:19:09] <ElenaManetta> WHAT
[4:19:11] <Solidnick18> you do it paige
[4:19:13] <ElenaManetta> WHAT WAS THAT
[4:19:17] <+JBarkey> @elenamanetta everyone just gets sleepy over time vs Freddy
[4:19:21] <MachetePhD> So, the DBD "universe" lore: The Survivors and Killers all exist within a sort of pocket-dimension, the realm of The Entity, which is effectively a living thing itself, but also a dimension. The Entity is a vampiric thing that feeds off of emotion, especially hope. So it brings people into the realm, and it puts them through the trials (the game matches), to invoke these emotions it can then consume. So every time a Survivor dies, that's real. The Entity just brings them back to repeat the cycle
[4:19:22] <SoFarFetched> That should be the trap
[4:19:25] <TeEmeraE> freddie blood trap
[4:19:32] <ElenaManetta> ah
[4:19:33] <@SarahTsang> @MachetePhD wooooosh
[4:19:53] <+MajorCrasher> survivors naturally fall asleep over time but fall asleep instantly if Freddy hits them
[4:20:16] <+JBarkey> @sarahtsang long story short, entity eats a piece of your soul every match.
[4:20:17] <TeEmeraE> ^
[4:20:17] <%MorningtonCrescent> Hey, if anyone has 10K points, now would be a great time to redeem cat paw gloves
[4:20:21] <ElenaManetta> Oh, does every survivor not see the nightmare the same time?
[4:20:27] <+MajorCrasher> you can see the sleep meter over the survivor names in the bottom left

[4:21:06] <@SarahTsang> @JBarkey nice
[4:21:09] <MachetePhD> I find it funny that Freddy is just so damn short compared to all the other characters LUL
[4:21:17] <+NitronStreams> 7, 8, better stay up late.
[4:21:22] <optimasmaximas> is it tho?
[4:21:32] <ElenaManetta> freddy's a manlet
[4:21:35] <ElenaManetta> that's why he's so angry
[4:21:49] <ElenaManetta> i don't like the squishy sound that trap makes
[4:21:49] <MachetePhD> I think the only other charactar that's shorter than he is is the Hag?
[4:21:57] <optimasmaximas> tf is a manlet?
[4:22:07] <crazypsico55> until they drop chucky
[4:22:14] <+JBarkey> @optimasmaximas he‚Äôs short
[4:22:17] <+Mendin> The flashlight is Very Powerful
[4:22:26] <SoFarFetched> Yeah it temporarily blinds them and can have them drop the survivor
[4:22:27] <@mishmashed> @optimasmaximas A man who's height is above midget level, but is well below that of any other man.
[4:22:34] <%AcolyteSynpai> You can stun off pickups and stuff with perfect timing
[4:22:35] <%olilink2002> the flashlight is actually pretty good in my opinion
[4:22:42] <@SarahTsang> Hiiii @AcolyteSynpai
[4:22:43] <+JBarkey> Other killers tend to tower over the survivors.
[4:22:44] <Zebroneath> You have a better chance of blinding a killer when they are vaulting or breaking a pallet.
[4:22:45] <@Ratmut> SYNPAAAAAAAAI
[4:22:46] <+Mendin> You blind/stun killers, it can make them drop survivors, it does bonuses against Wraith and Spirit, and it can turn off Hag's traps
[4:22:47] <@SarahTsang> !follow @AcolyteSynpai
[4:22:47] <@CephalonStalker> The Cult of DK DEMANDS that you follow acolytesynpai at http://www.twitch.tv/acolytesynpai !
[4:23:02] <ElenaManetta> if a serial killer has your friend just start blaring them in the eyes with a flashlight
[4:23:05] <ElenaManetta> good life skills
[4:23:07] <+MajorCrasher> usually you can find generators by just looking up for the floodlights but that's not feasible on indoor maps. which is another reason why they suck
[4:23:14] <MachetePhD> Imagine using the flashlight against Pyramid Head. What the fuck is "dead-centre" for that bastard? LUL

[4:34:01] <+MajorCrasher> ooh deathslingers
[4:34:08] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Yeah, like Trapper and Hag benefit from maps with a lot of tall grass, because it lets them hide their beartraps or runes respectively. While a character like the Huntress would benefit from places with lots of narrow corridors or low walls
[4:34:31] <Sentient_Ephime> Death comes to all. There is peace in death. DarkMode

[4:35:16] <Mr_Mushie> only at first
[4:35:17] <MachetePhD> @DKDiamantes Some Survivors do have very slight advantages though. Like Bill from L4D, is one of the loudest Survivors in the game. The guy CONSTANTLY coughs when he's injured
[4:35:28] <+JBarkey> @dkdiamantes at first, yes, but all survivor skills can be unlocked to everyone.
[4:35:29] <@SarahTsang> @ElenaManetta always watch out for those...
[4:35:34] <ElenaManetta> LISTEN HOW QUIET EVERYONE IS

[4:35:40] <ElenaManetta> THEY'RE TERRIFIED OF SHY

[4:39:20] <ElenaManetta> i love how dk wants to quit the game everytime he messes those up
[4:39:21] <theshillman> same
[4:39:23] <ElenaManetta> you can see it in his face
[4:39:25] <%Midashu> Those generators hate DK

[4:39:55] <%Darkmega97> sniped
[4:40:04] <ElenaManetta> this is so much more tense when the killer isn't going, "I GOT YOUR BALLS NOW BITCH" hahhahaha
[4:40:15] <AncelDeLambert> oh noooooo
[4:40:19] <ElenaManetta> we literally don't know what's happening from DK's perspective, it's hilarious and scary

[4:43:12] <@SarahTsang> @AnaStationLive we'll see how it goes! Shy usually plans it with everyone.
[4:43:41] <ElenaManetta> DK's gonna have to be the killer eventually
[4:43:43] <ElenaManetta> if this stream goes on long enough
[4:43:45] <Mathlexis> so am I... i've got like two matches under my belt and then was like: NOPE! Too much jump scares

[5:06:58] <AncelDeLambert> DRINK THE WATER
[5:07:05] <Starotter70> Don't be a coward
[5:07:09] <AncelDeLambert> cat's mouths are septic
[5:07:15] <+xmetalicdemonx> Drink that pussy water
[5:07:19] <ElenaManetta> i share my food with my cats and i'm alive psaElmo psaBlep psaBlep psaElmo
[5:07:20] <OperatorPlease> human mouths too!
[5:07:22] <PirateMike_> My cats always fuckin pushing her face into mine
[5:07:24] <+worldbrand> no animal's mouth is clean, and pee isn't sterile
[5:07:24] <%Darkmega97> Bites get infected super easy
[5:07:28] <%0Alyx0> dogs mouths also arent actually very clean at all @DKDiamantes
[5:07:32] <AncelDeLambert> if you get bitten by a cat and it draws blood, go to a clinic
[5:07:33] <@SarahTsang> woah
[5:07:34] <Mathlexis> this was a really bad time to take a drink of water... thanks guys...
[5:07:35] <+ragingbrachy> DansGame
[5:07:36] <Mathlexis> lol
[5:07:37] <%Darkmega97> Even a human bite is terrible
[5:07:38] <%thespianhunter> Ah, that explains my multitude of life threatening diseases
[5:07:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Wrong PAT
[5:07:45] <+Wallabri> i love cats .......but they nasty
[5:07:49] <PirateMike_> They also take a shit , walk on it, and then lick their feet
[5:07:49] <AncelDeLambert> bites are horrendous
[5:07:59] <+ragingbrachy> PROOF that dogs are better
[5:08:03] <ElenaManetta> The disease ratio is heavily lessened with domesticated indoor cats, though
[5:08:10] <PirateMike_> Everyone in chat has cats
[5:08:11] <XeroSigmaPrime> EVERY mouth is festering
[5:08:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Pat is super wrong.
[5:08:12] <+JBarkey> Cats have the second most toxic bite of non-venomous mammals. The most toxic is humans.
[5:08:16] <XeroSigmaPrime> INcluding dogs
[5:08:20] <Mathlexis> @ragingbrachy LIES!!! Cats are better then the borking borkers
[5:08:24] <%olilink2002> @OperatorPlease i was talking about the killer in the game

[5:08:43] <XeroSigmaPrime> @BallerSwagBro9k what? Their mouths are disgusting
[5:08:44] <+NitronStreams> i will never have a cat
[5:08:45] <PirateMike_> Dogs good cats half good
[5:08:50] <AncelDeLambert> Paige, any hope for a double and you watching Star Trek tonight?
[5:08:51] <@SarahTsang> Cute
[5:09:09] <AncelDeLambert> I like any map that's not inside
[5:09:11] <Mathlexis> @PirateMike_ ... ya know what you right, dogs are lawful good, cats are chaotic evil
[5:09:16] <AncelDeLambert> the inside maps need to all DIE
[5:09:16] <+BNPhone> who keeps using the swamp map LUL
[5:09:24] <%Darkmega97> A cat is worth like 2 dogs
[5:09:34] <PirateMike_> @Mathlexis Id say chaotic neutral
[5:09:52] <XeroSigmaPrime> Dogs mouths are in NO WAY cleaner than humans without any external care like brushing
[5:10:05] <PirateMike_> Dogs lick other dogs ass

[5:10:52] <XeroSigmaPrime> Basically, unless you salivate alcohol, your mouth will be naturally filthy
[5:10:59] <TeEmeraE> you can also blow up the gen to wake yourself up
[5:11:07] <+JBarkey> Freddys dream traps don‚Äôt work on survivors that are awake @dkdiamantes
[5:11:07] <TeEmeraE> or fail when self heal
[5:11:31] <+BNPhone> but there is also an addon that disables that
[5:11:31] <TeEmeraE> hex trap WutFace
[5:11:31] <PirateMike_> Is DKs jacket a dlc thing?
[5:11:47] <PirateMike_> Aight cool
[5:11:49] <AncelDeLambert> MOST are dlc
[5:11:52] <AncelDeLambert> it kinda sucks
[5:12:00] <ElenaManetta> the freddy ash is so cool
[5:12:04] <AncelDeLambert> how does Freddie pull you in to the dream?
[5:12:09] <ElenaManetta> god i can't wait to hear the silent hill siren with pyramid head
[5:12:09] <+BNPhone> And Freddy is using the addon where you can't fail a skill check to wake up

[5:12:39] <ElenaManetta> nice dodge, roz, HA-HA!
[5:12:41] <ElenaManetta> (slash)
[5:12:45] <%thespianhunter> Freddy is using NordVPN, and masking their IP address
[5:13:14] <%MoonWatcher21> Yeah blame Shy
[5:13:18] <AncelDeLambert> DK is making just the BIGGEST TRAIL to follow possible
[5:13:23] <%MoonWatcher21> I dont even know what she did
[5:13:26] <%MoonWatcher21> but yeah
[5:13:32] <+arancet> remember paige is blind, so if you just crouch in the grass you will be invisible
[5:13:32] <ElenaManetta> I like how as the stream progresses, everyone is getting more focused
[5:13:42] <ElenaManetta> AAAHHH
[5:13:44] <ElenaManetta> FUCK THAT
[5:13:46] <XeroSigmaPrime> @AnaStationLive Chyea, if anyone even gives a second to think about it, theres NO WAY a dogs mouth can be cleaner
[5:13:50] <AncelDeLambert> oooookay
[5:13:50] <Starotter70> What's that smell?
[5:13:54] <ElenaManetta> that was gross, video game
[5:13:57] <AncelDeLambert> bleeding generators, alright
[5:13:58] <+BNPhone> iz blud
[5:14:42] <+BNPhone> if you see a glowing skull on the ground hold m1 on that bad boy
[5:14:45] <AncelDeLambert> so what makes the generator bleed?
[5:15:01] <ElenaManetta> you should train yourself so when you hear that echo ding you tell yourself EYES CENTER
[5:15:04] <+BNPhone> freddy has a power where he can teleport to generators, that's the animation for it

[5:16:20] <+MajorCrasher> actually waiting for the sound cue isn't great. there's multiple killer perks that delay or speed up the skill check sound or remove it entirely
[5:16:22] <TheFramedWarlock> Sup dwaPiaf
[5:16:37] <+MajorCrasher> it's better to just never look away while doing a gen
[5:16:44] <@SarahTsang> @TheFramedWarlock welcome!
[5:16:49] <+Bailey__gaming> why does the generator run on blood?
[5:17:20] <%Darkmega97> @bailey__gaming Because it's spoooooooky
[5:17:21] <+BNPhone> those are incredibly rare and when it happens one time you know for the rest of the match @MajorCrasher
[5:17:35] <+MajorCrasher> it doesn't run on blood, Freddy just magically makes it spew blood as a tell for his teleport
[5:17:36] <@Ratmut> HahaGingercat
[5:17:48] <AnaStationLive> @Bailey__gaming because ghosts!
[5:17:50] <mield916> Hey sofar

[5:19:08] <@SarahTsang> @ChrisPlaysThing he's been enjoying it and so has Paige as Killer
[5:19:09] <+BNPhone> counterpoint -> his puppet hand skin
[5:19:27] <AncelDeLambert> what monster did Ash come with?
[5:19:35] <+WhereIsWill> pat does it for his orb fans

[5:19:51] <SoFarFetched> ive been doing both survivor and killer and i find both fun
[5:19:51] <+itIsJustMat> he didn't come with one
[5:19:53] <AncelDeLambert> WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[5:20:41] <ElenaManetta> leave
[5:20:43] <AncelDeLambert> if DK's survivor could just SHUT UP that'd be great
[5:20:44] <+BNPhone> LUL
[5:20:52] <+WhereIsWill> same @SoFarFetched i like both. huntress the best
[5:20:55] <ElenaManetta> never save pat
[5:21:03] <ElenaManetta> go out of your way to make sure dies if you can
[5:21:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @anceldelambert Nah its hot Kappa

[5:21:14] <+NitronStreams> F
[5:21:15] <ElenaManetta> I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.
[5:21:16] <PirateMike_> Or survival of the cowardiest
[5:21:20] <SoFarFetched> landing huntress' axe throws feel satisfying LUL
[5:21:21] <ElenaManetta> I TOLD YOU TO GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO LET HIM DIE!
[5:21:27] <AncelDeLambert> bye Pat
[5:21:30] <AncelDeLambert> Bye DK
[5:21:37] <+NitronStreams> Never go back for Pat
[5:21:37] <ElenaManetta> FREDDY'S A TUNNELING BITCH
[5:21:37] <AncelDeLambert> Paige don't camp
[5:21:45] <SoFarFetched> im trying to get better at the throws slowly,but Ive only done trapper and her so far
[5:21:51] <@retequizzle> always go for the kobe
[5:22:00] <jestrfestr> can rebind struggle to mouse wheel down
[5:22:01] <+BNPhone> if all 4 people bring salty lips you can get it pretty much every time
[5:22:03] <jestrfestr> makes it better
[5:22:03] <AncelDeLambert> those two are my main choice, too, Fetched
[5:22:18] <AncelDeLambert> they're great to start with especially when you're cheap like me and don't want to spend money on shit
[5:22:34] <SoFarFetched> yeah i havent gotten DLC yet,so wanted to learn killers slowly.
[5:22:41] <+BNPhone> it's an offering
[5:22:42] <AncelDeLambert> And there's NO feeling like chasing a survivor and having them run STRAIGHT into a bear trap
[5:22:45] <AncelDeLambert> god it feels amazing
[5:22:55] <jestrfestr> its an offering
[5:23:13] <SoFarFetched> Ive had a moment where two people fell into a bear trap within a few feet of each other LUL
[5:23:13] <+BNPhone> it's on the first page of offerings you;re in perks
[5:23:18] <AncelDeLambert> which is why the game quickly becomes un-fun. Survivors on high rank matches always find and disable all your bear traps, it sucks ass
[5:23:20] <SoFarFetched> so i smacked both of them
[5:23:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 24 HOURS
[5:23:51] <%reedkage> as long as it takes to sate her bloodlust
[5:24:19] <SoFarFetched> yeah i would imagine higher rank is harder for trapper

[5:38:32] <+JBarkey> Myers and ghost face good if you prefer jump scaring people. ONI or hillbilly are good for berserker players, cause they have fast-moving 1-hit kills...

[5:41:10] <+Mendin> Oni has the bonus of tracking their BLUHD
[5:41:15] <AncelDeLambert> @DKDiamantes Find a group of generators that are very close together and patrol them. Even if you lose the gens on the far side of the map, you'll have a small group you can monitor.

[5:57:01] <+WhereIsWill> the orb IS the ENTITY
[5:57:02] <%Darkmega97> I thought page loved skeletons
[5:57:04] <PirateMike_> The orb is a staple of PatStaresAT
[5:57:06] <ElenaManetta> "what's elmo water" "what's orb" "what's happening"
[5:57:06] <smartiger117> Keeper of the Orb
[5:57:09] <+ChrisPlaysThing> She likes Orbs and Skeletons, it's just how she is
[5:57:12] <+Mendin> No DK you were thinking about Schlorpy
[5:57:16] <smartiger117> Lord Orb-o
[5:57:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ORB LORE IS IMPORTANT
[5:57:26] <ElenaManetta> papyrus killer
[5:57:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> what would a skeleton's cosmetics be? just clothes?
[5:57:33] <+Bailey__gaming> Peach would main a skelly killer
[5:57:37] <+BNPhone> This game is not ready for skeleton ball
[5:57:38] <smartiger117> His Orbiness
[5:57:41] <TeEmeraE> gonna sleep now, good luck have fun crew. survive!
[5:57:43] <@SarahTsang> she would @Bailey__gaming
[5:57:45] <+NitronStreams> *bone noises intensify*
[5:57:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> "The Skeleton. That's it."
[5:57:51] <mirrorframe> yo@ballerswagbro9k is cool i dont know wi but i may yell out some pepes
[5:57:52] <ElenaManetta> is the grim reaper technically a killer
[5:57:55] <+Bailey__gaming> Skelletor as killer :P
[5:57:55] <ElenaManetta> people would not die without him
[5:57:58] <+WhereIsWill> gravelord nito for DBD
[5:58:02] <%thespianhunter> Wheres my vampire killer - now THAT would be my jam
[5:58:06] <+Bailey__gaming> MYEAH Heman! ill get you
[5:58:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Pat in a fact an a schlorb which is an Orb filled with slut juice. His words not mine btw
[5:58:19] <%Darkmega97> The skeleton killer just doots at the survivors
[5:58:35] <mirrorframe> what is this game
[5:58:39] <ElenaManetta> i want whoever plays as freddy to talk like freddy
[5:58:43] <@SarahTsang> @mirrorframe Dead by daylight
[5:58:45] <weissguard> Skeleton Killer cosmetics would probably be bone wax.
[5:58:48] <+NitronStreams> I am thou. Thou art me. We're a happy family.
[5:59:00] <mirrorframe> shot horrror
[5:59:01] <tzuin21> ye skeletor as survivor and He-Man as killer seasalLUL
[5:59:10] <mirrorframe> um out of context
[5:59:19] <ElenaManetta> I MAY BE A HOOKER BUT YOU'RE THE REAL WHORE, BITCH
[5:59:19] <+BNPhone> I just have a macro that struggles for me, you could also bind struggle to mouse wheel
[5:59:22] <ElenaManetta> all raspy voice
[5:59:23] <+BNPhone> dont snitch on me to the devs tho
[5:59:27] <+Bailey__gaming> He-Man would just play that meme song when he's near yopu
[5:59:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> all of you suck
[5:59:48] <dustworthmain> it's true
[5:59:52] <+NitronStreams> technically all killers are hookers in this game.
[5:59:54] <@SarahTsang> LOL
[5:59:56] <%Darkmega97> plague is correct
[6:00:16] <smartiger117> Indeed
[6:00:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> no one in chat is any good either
[6:00:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Plague hates humanity
[6:00:23] <+ChrisPlaysThing> That would be his terror radius song i agree @PlagueOfGripes

[6:00:48] <+LeoStrahl> Plague will show you all a good murder?
[6:00:51] <Joustar_> if everyone sucks, is anyone good?
[6:00:52] <ElenaManetta> ha ha you just swiped pat again instead
[6:00:53] <PirateMike_> HAHA
[6:00:55] <@SarahTsang> @ChrisPlaysThing You could be good at sucking
[6:00:56] <+ChrisPlaysThing> i'm a barely human gremlin at the best of time really
[6:01:04] <SummonerMagno> Paige camping
[6:01:06] <+Mendin> NO DONT MENTION COTTON EYE JOE AROUND PAIGE
[6:01:09] <theshillman> smelter delt joe
[6:01:24] <+Mendin> She ruined that song further
[6:01:36] <madskull456> hey pat hey paige
[6:01:36] <ElenaManetta> WHY DON'T YOU HANG AROUND, BITCH
[6:01:52] <Starotter70> The real question of the stream is, will Paige make the Oink noise?
[6:02:00] <mirrorframe> eny one whantnto itroduce me to the channel
[6:02:14] <%MorningtonCrescent> take on me. Take Me On. I'LL BE GONE in a day or twoooooo
[6:02:18] <+ChrisPlaysThing> salty lips say try
[6:02:23] <@SarahTsang> @MorningtonCrescent i love that dance
[6:02:23] <+BNPhone> yes
[6:02:24] <ElenaManetta> wait it
[6:02:25] <ElenaManetta> last minute
[6:02:27] <+LeoStrahl> I know I've heard the cotton eye thing but can't recall, is this like the guys faking it story?
[6:02:29] <ElenaManetta> see if pat sacrifices imself again
[6:02:43] <ElenaManetta> IS THAT PAT
[6:02:52] <+BNPhone> Pat is Ash
[6:02:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> this message brought to you by macro squad
[6:02:57] <ElenaManetta> no its just another hero
[6:02:58] <ElenaManetta> shy i bet
[6:03:13] <+BNPhone> that totem was the ruin I think
[6:03:16] <madskull456> nani?! pat playing survivor
[6:03:20] <ElenaManetta> oh lawd shes coming
[6:03:42] <@SarahTsang> @madskull456 Yah, Pat has been palying survivor and Paige, killer. they've both been enjoying it
[6:03:42] <Starotter70> Does Paige have a buff that makes her attack more effective against women?
[6:03:42] <+Bailey__gaming> Paige is adept at women killing especially
[6:03:49] <+ChrisPlaysThing> wrekt
[6:03:50] <%MorningtonCrescent> And now I DM the best cover of that song, @SarahTsang
[6:03:55] <ElenaManetta> paige has an easier time killing her friends than random strangers
[6:03:57] <+Mendin> Just play Blendette against Paige and you'll escape without an issue
[6:04:06] <madskull456> lol paige loves it
[6:04:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> a little uncreative for Freddy
[6:04:12] <SummonerMagno> the problem is your avatars are women
[6:04:19] <+LeoStrahl> Is dead by daylight just Paige with her limiters removed?
[6:04:21] <+WhereIsWill> paige has a +5 skill check towards women
[6:04:25] <@SarahTsang> @MorningtonCrescent beautiful
[6:04:44] <ElenaManetta> HOLD ON GUYS PAUSE THE GAME
[6:04:48] <ElenaManetta> TIME OUT
[6:04:57] <SummonerMagno> each female survivor doubles her killer instincts
[6:04:59] <+BNPhone> you need addons for it
[6:05:15] <madskull456> lol pat is really like "hey wait look" runs away*
[6:05:57] <+ChrisPlaysThing> i would have imagined he would have much more brutal kills
[6:05:58] <+BNPhone> it's all up to you now finish the mission
[6:06:01] <+LeoStrahl> See, 3 of the 4 are her preferred targets, and the 4th is Pat. It's only natural really
[6:06:19] <+Bailey__gaming> man that makes me want a killer based off of seminal 80s childrens tv show in england Trapdoor
[6:06:21] <+BNPhone> the earlier moris are much more tame
[6:06:28] <+BNPhone> left
[6:06:41] <+BNPhone> she ran past the hatch NotLikeThis
[6:06:48] <ElenaManetta> gross
[6:07:19] <smartiger117> Mr.X or Nemesis as the killer
[6:07:20] <+LeoStrahl> He would've had more brutal kills, but y'know. He was sleeping on the job
[6:07:28] <+ChrisPlaysThing> take me crab daddy
[6:07:30] <ElenaManetta> paige secretly wants to murder her friends i suppose
[6:07:37] <ElenaManetta> lotta pent up rage in there
[6:07:44] <%thespianhunter> eeeeeeeeyyyyyy!
[6:07:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Paige luvs to kill womun
[6:07:54] <+WhereIsWill> not much of a secret tbh

[6:09:19] <+LeoStrahl> Kind of disappointed that she didn't play oni. Could've congratulated another sword for it's good work
