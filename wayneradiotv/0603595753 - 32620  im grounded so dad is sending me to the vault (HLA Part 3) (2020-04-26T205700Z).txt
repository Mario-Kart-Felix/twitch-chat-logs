[0:10:36] <%JackHotep> A tax (from the Latin taxo) is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures.[2] A failure to pay, along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC.

[0:11:13] <alichay> @tr9000 you get what you pay for, with VR. The best VR equipment is the most expensive, and as it gets cheaper, it gets substantially worse. My experience is with the Vive and the Index Controllers, as well as the Vive and the Vive controllers. I've seen a ton of people say that the Samsung Oddessey+ is good as well, but I don't have any experience with that. Vive+Index Controllers works fucking amazingly if you can swing that though

[1:15:09] <%berro___> the bullet reservoir upgrade allows you to put 21 total bullets in the gun. to get those bullets in there insert a magazine let it empty into the reservoir then eject and put in another full mag
[1:15:10] <%hireddivas> crossbow was dope
[1:15:11] <+bug_smoke> hl1 had cool guns
[1:15:11] <%ashen_smithy> they're limited to one handers for a vr game its not suprising they only have 3 guns
[1:15:12] <+SmellyFeetYouHave> you don't have an HEV suit you can't carry 15 guns at once
[1:15:13] <+bug_smoke> hl2 was BORING
[1:15:13] <@sana_kan> half-life 1 had a better set of weapons yeah
[1:15:17] <%totallysparky> i prefer hl1's weapons
[1:15:17] <%hireddivas> yeeah
[1:15:17] <%Wackalope> The hl1 spinoffs had the best weapons
[1:15:17] <%CuteChallenger> You have to remember: This not Gordon and also VR
[1:15:18] <@sana_kan> snarks baby
[1:15:19] <Turtle_of_Happiness> You have the AR3, you don't get to complain
[1:15:20] <%MissFroggish> youre literally upgrading the pulse gun

[1:15:26] <TheUnsatisfied001> UPGRADE UR PASSPORT
[1:15:27] <+bug_smoke> the only interesting one was the crossbow and a million games had crossbow
[1:15:33] <+NomadNoah> it's not that the gunplay in hl2 was exciting, it's that the guns themselves were interesting to look at and interact with
[1:15:37] <%benry_the_2nd> @wayneradiotv you got the AR3
[1:15:37] <Gilboron> A one-handed crossbow could certainly be done

[1:43:49] <%Robertsmania> Time-out is a form of behavioral modification that involves temporarily separating a person from an environment where an unacceptable behavior has occurred. The goal is to remove that person from an enriched, enjoyable environment, and therefore lead to extinction of the offending behavior.
