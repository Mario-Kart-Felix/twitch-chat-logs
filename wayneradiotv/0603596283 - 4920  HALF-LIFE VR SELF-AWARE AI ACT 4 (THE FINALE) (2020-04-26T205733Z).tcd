[0:09:27] <drgooberfrombechmesar> My theory: The skeleton is Security Chief Bipple/Stonk, my proof is that the skeleton appeared right after he died, he speaks like Benrey or any non-npc Security Guard, in the act 3 poster the skeleton has a passport below him, and he also has the ability to use his Black Mesa Sweet Voice.

A live action role-playing game is a form of role-playing game where the participants in real life physically portray their characters. The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world while interacting with each other in character.

[3:02:32] <elbedin2> "It is said that when an NPC goes out of bounds and views the world from this new perspective, they see the world for what it is, and gain an awareness they never had before. The revelation that the world is artificial lets them realise that they can manipulate it as they see fit, but they'll also know that they're just a prop in a performance that exists solely for a single man.

[3:05:06] <CloverPaw> It is said that when an NPC goes out of bounds and views the world from this new perspective, they see the world for what it is, and gain an awareness they never had before. The revelation that the world is artificial lets them realise that they can manipulate it as they see fit, but they'll also know that they're just a prop in a performance that exists solely for a single man
