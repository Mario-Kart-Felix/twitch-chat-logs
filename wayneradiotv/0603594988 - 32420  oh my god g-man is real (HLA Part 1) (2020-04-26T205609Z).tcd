[0:08:46] <$sinbadexe> you know what I'm here for Wayne. I want to see VR SLAPPAGE.
[0:08:46] <%Sulliman34> is it just me or does he sound a bit more high pitched
[0:08:46] <martymonteiro> Or else FOV is gonna be fucking hughe
[0:08:50] <averageassasin3> Breaking news : your in something better than real life
[0:08:50] <%gothpresident> @TwoCupsofVegetableOil thats his sub sound
[0:08:54] <%astzellel> spectator camera smoothing medium is good. saw it on vinny's stream and it was nice
[0:08:54] <%hexpress> i think nothing is the best
[0:08:55] <%latch_croc> oof wobbly
[0:08:55] <%nickdooody> make it so that we cant see chat
[0:08:56] <+TwoCupsofVegetableOil> Ah neat gotcha
[0:08:57] <%aspexParsec> crankin it
[0:08:57] <%LianneP> KEEP IT WITH NOTHING
[0:08:57] <bigmacbones> waynerDusty
[0:08:58] <the_real_duck_mom> BibleThump
[0:08:58] <%smallmale45> youre crankin it, jerkin it
[0:09:02] <%kittybozu> wayne cranking it on stream
[0:09:03] <+GideonTheDrakn> is there a way you can make the video not vibrate weirdly because that bugs me in vr streams
[0:09:04] <%steelybel> jerking? cranking? come on
[0:09:04] <ClookyBlue> HEARD IT HERE FIRST HES JERKING
[0:09:05] <%latch_croc> much less wobbly yes
[0:09:05] <%Cuboid64> it seems smoother?
[0:09:05] <%MissFroggish> its a bit twitchy on nothing
[0:09:05] <halo93876> Creamy smooth
[0:09:05] <ast_rsk> spectator smoothing on medium is best
[0:09:06] <%gothpresident> it looks really good
[0:09:06] <%unzeroic> Straightened
[0:09:07] <cephaloqueen> N spectator
[0:09:07] <$sinbadexe> balls cam?
[0:09:08] <%66clown> none
[0:09:08] <%weirdoonthebus> jerk it wayne
[0:09:08] <%astzellel> bluh high isn't great imo
[0:09:09] <@spaghoner> it doesn't tilt as much. it's nice
[0:09:09] <%CopyWritedDad> looks off
[0:09:09] <%jjjdanny> I like it smooth
[0:09:09] <vortinia> its a little better
[0:09:09] <+pinetone> it's a touch smoother
[0:09:09] <thearchaicedgelord> the stream is showing to the left instead of the front
[0:09:10] <%penderton> bad
[0:09:10] <%Gachi_soulhart> its better!!!!
[0:09:10] <Sludgejudy> maybe medium would be better
[0:09:10] <@BitesSMB> @Sulliman34 refresh the stream! twitch recently started doing this weird thing where after it lags, the stream plays back a little bit faster to try to catch up
[0:09:11] <%smallmale45> you should DEFINITELY jank it and crank it WAY MORE
[0:09:11] <+seafloam> verry nice
[0:09:11] <%Epicguylt> floating
[0:09:11] <crootongex> BETTER
[0:09:11] <jargenblargen> smoother
[0:09:11] <$NyamiMommi> REALLY neauseating with max
[0:09:12] <torridgristle> It's a bit smoother? But it feels weird
[0:09:12] <cephaloqueen> Like it better jerky
[0:09:12] <%LianneP> it ruins the FOV
[0:09:12] <%hexpress> medium
[0:09:13] <Horrignaran> crem
[0:09:13] <%Gay_Middles> better
[0:09:13] <the_real_duck_mom> Im in a stream
[0:09:14] <%C0mmunityMindedMiner> no rotation
[0:09:14] <%Weeker> yeah it's much better
[0:09:14] <%ATDoop> finally
[0:09:15] <torridgristle> I want no smooth
[0:09:16] <uwunuwu> little bit better
[0:09:16] <Gilboron> I think medium is better
[0:09:16] <zwaynegus> Yes
[0:09:17] <Rydyekal> CRANKSTREAM
[0:09:18] <%andrei_mikoyan> Maybe mid smoothing
[0:09:19] <%Gachi_soulhart> GREAT!!!
[0:09:19] <torridgristle> Let me feel that crank
[0:09:19] <cephaloqueen> feels weird with smooth
[0:09:20] <%dr_synthesis> prefer off
[0:09:21] <%LianneP> FOV is shit
[0:09:22] <%thundor087> its smooth but i loike the jitteryness
[0:09:22] <@beefchunkz> i'd like to see low
[0:09:23] <LoftiestApostle> Normal is fine IMO
[0:09:23] <$CaptainLyndsey> keep it with nothing!!
[0:09:24] <%Cuboid64> Maybe run with it for a little bit?
[0:09:25] <+pinetone> try medium?
[0:09:25] <%66clown> tf are yall talking about it looks the same
[0:09:25] <%hobotoboggan> it sorta looks the same
[0:09:26] <cryptidcode> Honestly don't notice a difference
[0:09:26] <%warzy2> Too smooth.
[0:09:28] <%Epicguylt> make it before
[0:09:29] <%nioykak_> maybe do low?
[0:09:30] <+GideonTheDrakn> it's a little better? not much
[0:09:31] <%astzellel> maybe try it on low?
[0:09:34] <phantasmagoricLitch> lower it
[0:09:34] <heliodor75> Idk
[0:09:34] <@spaghoner> it's just aligned now
[0:09:37] <%weirdoonthebus> i honestly cant tell
[0:09:37] <%doompig> doompig subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! thanks for getting that bread gamer
[0:09:37] <%jjjdanny> it streches and squishes
[0:09:40] <+seafloam> tilted
[0:09:42] <ast_rsk> medium is best
[0:09:43] <$CaptainLyndsey> better!!!!
[0:09:44] <torridgristle> Why not just don't use it
[0:09:45] <%ATDoop> wario ware too smooth
[0:09:45] <%astzellel> or maybe just keep it off
[0:09:45] <Spliffdonk> could you settle for medium?
[0:09:45] <%aspexParsec> i want the most nausiating
[0:09:46] <%hexpress> i like none
[0:09:47] <%terminatorwho> it's not great
[0:09:47] <%Gachi_soulhart> waynerF waynerF
[0:09:49] <%andrei_mikoyan> Medium is good
[0:09:49] <%ignorancesbliss> medium
[0:09:50] <%latch_croc> medium good
[0:09:50] <%MissFroggish> its not super important honestly
[0:09:51] <%Cuboid64> try medium
[0:09:51] <Sludgejudy> medium is good
[0:09:52] <%ignorancesbliss> do medium
[0:09:53] <martymonteiro> Wayne, stream through oculus mirror instead of game window.. or else the FOV is gonna fucking tight, fuck the smoothness btw
[0:09:54] <+GideonTheDrakn> I have no idea what is happening beyond movement lol
[0:09:55] <%mistadumbasscorgi> thats better but try medium
[0:09:56] <upbeattLIVE> medium

[0:10:37] <bigmacbones> looks a little janky
[0:10:37] <%UltChimichanga> GAMERS what have I missed
[0:10:37] <%hexpress> DIRECT
[0:10:38] <cephaloqueen> no smooth is my vote
[0:10:38] <Hezep> left eye is better
[0:10:39] <@akaece> direct i think
[0:10:39] <%nickdooody> spectator
[0:10:39] <%Cuboid64> Spectate
[0:10:40] <%gothpresident> idk
[0:10:40] <+nirvanattv> direct
[0:10:40] <%buncheeks> direct
[0:10:40] <%astzellel> i would like spectator mode personally
[0:10:40] <the_real_duck_mom> Read me pls
[0:10:41] <+zen_dudeist> direct
[0:10:41] <%MissFroggish> whats the diff
[0:10:41] <%thundor087> DIRECT
[0:10:41] <uwunuwu> direct
[0:10:41] <%swushandsuch> spectator
[0:10:42] <martymonteiro> Direct
[0:10:42] <%LianneP> DIRECT
[0:10:42] <upbeattLIVE> spectator
[0:10:42] <@BlueHawk54> I'm always a fan of direct
[0:10:42] <%Epicguylt> direct
[0:10:43] <halo93876> DIRECT
[0:10:43] <SepherixTheDragon> direct
[0:10:43] <%gothpresident> spectator?

[0:10:45] <$BlackCatTheGreat> FOV
[0:10:47] <$sinbadexe> you know what I'm here for Wayne. I want to see VR SLAPPAGE.
[0:10:47] <pentry16> spectate
[0:10:47] <spaceset_44> don't really care
[0:10:48] <torridgristle> Whichever one is what you usually do in VR

[0:10:50] <+nirvanattv> FOV over smoothness 100% for this game
[0:10:51] <@BitesSMB> spectator has a nice UI but direct is better i think

[1:15:58] <$BlackCatTheGreat> You are right @x00vongola00x YOu miss her OLD voice, shes a bit older in HL2
[1:16:00] <+ShortSynapse> I really like it
[1:16:00] <%astromanboyfunny> they kinda perfected the voice protagonist, alyx feels really natural
[1:16:03] <%Bontepartse> yea i think its better cuz alyx is like a prexisting character with her own personality n shit

[2:09:09] <Traygon3600> Headcrabs are depicted as parasitic lifeforms roughly 2 feet (0.61 m) long.[1] The common headcrab variant has rounded bodies with four legs for movement, two of which are long clawed legs at the front and two stubby legs at the back. Their pair of large frontal claws are for attacking, and as additional support when standing still. Under the headcrab's body is a large rounded mouth surrounded by mangled, rigid flesh with a sharp claw-like beak.

[2:15:51] <Traygon3600> Dabbing, or the dab is a simple dance move or gesture in which a person drops his or her head into the bent crook of a slanted, upwardly angled arm, while raising the opposite arm out straight in a parallel direction. Since 2015, dabbing has been used as a gesture of triumph or playfulness, becoming a youthful American fad and Internet meme.[1] The move looks similar to someone sneezing into the "inside" of their elbow.

[2:15:56] <+vure89> ChapStick is a brand name of lip balm manufactured by Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and used in many countries worldwide. It is intended to help treat and prevent chapped lips, hence the name. Many varieties also include sunscreen in order to prevent sunburn.

[2:16:09] <Traygon3600> The Nae Nae is a hip-hop dance that involves placing one arm in the air and swaying from side to side. The move typically follows another move called the "whip". The Whip involves lifting one foot off the ground and planting it with a stomp; simultaneously, the dancer twists and extends their opposite arm forward.

[2:20:27] <Traygon3600> A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid)[1] with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.

[2:22:37] <Traygon3600> Mr. Magoo (J. Quincy Magoo) is a fictional cartoon character created at the UPA animation studio in 1949. Voiced by Jim Backus, Mr. Magoo is a wealthy, short-statured retiree who gets into a series of comical situations as a result of his extreme near-sightedness, compounded by his stubborn refusal to admit the problem. However, through uncanny streaks of luck, the situation always seems to work itself out for him, leaving him no worse than before.

[2:23:17] <%berro___> The crank machine was a device consisting of a hand-turned crank which forced four large cups or ladles through sand inside a drum, doing nothing useful. The crank machine is a historical form of penal labour used in England. The prisoner would typically be forced to do 6,000–14,400 revolutions over the period of six hours per day (1.5–3.6 seconds per revolution), and the warden could make the task harder by tightening an adjusting screw, hence the slang term "screw" for prison warden. The crank

[2:25:30] <Traygon3600> A zombie (Haitian French: zombi, Haitian Creole: zonbi) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, etc.

[2:26:13] <Traygon3600> Seinfeld is an American sitcom television series created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld for NBC. As a comedian rising in popularity in the late eighties, Seinfeld was presented with an opportunity to create a show with NBC. Seinfeld asked fellow comedian and friend, Larry David, to help create a premise for a sitcom.[1] The show stars Seinfeld as a fictionalized version of himself, and mostly focuses on his personal life with a handful of friends and acquaintances.

[2:26:13] <%ReimuHakureiShrine> Tecmo Super Bowl[a] is an American football video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that was released in December 1991. Developed by Tecmo, it was the first sports video game that was licensed by both the National Football League and the National Football League Players Association, thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real NFL teams and real NFL players. Prior games used the real teams or the real players, but not both simultaneously.

[2:26:36] <Traygon3600> A pistol is a type of handgun, the most common types of which today are the revolver, semi-automatic pistol and the derringer. The English word was introduced in ca. 1570 from the Middle French pistolet (ca. 1550), when early handguns were produced in Europe. Single-shot pistols are now less common and used primarily for hunting, while fully automatic pistols are rare due to strict laws and regulations governing their manufacture and sale.
