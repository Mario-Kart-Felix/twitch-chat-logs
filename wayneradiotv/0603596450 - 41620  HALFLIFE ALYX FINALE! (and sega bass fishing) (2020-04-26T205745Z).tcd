[0:31:33] <%birchlogz> pro tip: wear a tuxedo fishing and maybe they will think you are hot and willingly come close
[0:31:35] <malkremie93> theres a great chinese place near me but my dad is being racist about it, so
[0:31:35] <%redkamel> its good
[0:31:42] <%antrozoini> there’s no slow reel

[0:32:11] <%Aquacycle> they're cummin
[0:32:12] <%Cosmic199X> Wayne i feel like the only reason it's going at max speed is because the reel is based on analog control on the controller itself??

[4:16:12] <%penderton> youve never been to a waffle house?
[4:16:13] <%Arbmanthesheep> When I went to CT we went to Friendly's since I've never been and we had such bad service I swore that we would never go back again. We basically got our order pushed back because they priorities 2 families who came after us.

[4:16:16] <%redkamel> YES
[4:16:17] <@sana_kan> oh yeah I forgot you northerners don't have waffle house

[4:23:11] <+JustThumps> Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.

[5:10:33] <%The_turts> Paprika time
[5:10:34] <%Coaltol> imagine modders using this gravity shit in custom maps
[5:10:34] <%MineturtlePLS> god watching this outside of vr is making me feel funny
[5:10:38] <%hostileuser> this is so disorienting
[5:10:40] <Max_Millien> that is so strange
[5:10:41] <%hireddivas> get off the ceiling!
[5:10:41] <@MasterGir> everybody goes the wrong way here
[5:10:45] <iLike_femboys> "Gravity? who gives a crap about gravity?" scout tf2
[5:10:57] <LtBoink> mc escher vibes
[5:10:57] <Halcyonblue> im gonna be SICK
[5:10:59] <%hrngggg> this in vr feels like it'd make you woozy as shit
[5:11:02] <%Churchydragon> oh ew they're hairy
[5:11:05] <+mangopoppy> @hrngggg it seriously does
[5:11:07] <%Robertsmania> Gordon it appears you have broken gravity
[5:11:08] <+Doctor_Vaseline> were those fast headcrabs?
[5:11:11] <%ATDoop> this is so cool
[5:11:13] <@MasterGir> it's actually harder to watch in flat tbh
[5:11:13] <%TyeFyeDye> god this is truppy
[5:11:14] <%vvorldtour> MIGUEL
[5:11:18] <%hireddivas> neat
[5:11:19] <@MasterGir> it feels fine in vr
[5:11:19] <cozylittleartblog> nah, poison headcrabs
[5:11:23] <@sourcefieldmix> wobbly world
[5:11:24] <Twismyer> Yeah it's less weird in vr
[5:11:25] <%drybonesthegod> this feels like a psychonauts level
[5:11:25] <Thejas21> the music is so goooood
[5:11:25] <%cybergaynet> I loved fucking with the gravity in this bit
[5:11:26] <%redkamel> thanks i hate this
[5:11:27] <%hostileuser> jesus
[5:11:27] <%MineturtlePLS> weirdo dsp is back baby
[5:11:28] <%UltChimichanga> oh I think i might be getting motion sick
[5:11:28] <+uncensored_balls> watching this without vr really doesn't capture how much this confuses your brain. They did a really good job here.
[5:11:30] <%PlutoniumStudios> We're running out of time
[5:11:36] <@sourcefieldmix> hate when that happens
[5:11:39] <spectri_lee> f o r k s
[5:11:42] <%hireddivas> lookspointy
[5:11:43] <michaelthewolf1> iverted housekeeping
[5:11:43] <theendergamingbg> alyx u broke the physics of the earth ur grounded
[5:11:45] <Max_Millien> even without VR, this nearly impossible to follow
[5:11:46] <$ladydame> matrix
[5:11:46] <%pine_raven> More VR games should have gravity stuff like this
[5:11:48] <%UltChimichanga> field of blades
[5:11:50] <%MaxLebled> there is no spoon
[5:11:50] <%hostileuser> holy shit

[5:11:52] <michaelthewolf1> inverted*
[5:11:53] <@sourcefieldmix> mom the utinsels are revolting again
[5:11:56] <Twismyer> This is the part of the game that actually spooked me a bit though
[5:11:57] <%SamKaiser> take the butterknife, its your melee weapon now
[5:11:57] <+JustThumps> the warp noises
[5:11:58] <+JustThumps> ugh
[5:11:59] <%hostileuser> i'm not even the one playing the game and i'm excited
[5:12:00] <%cybergaynet> literally people whine about not being able to play this game flat but the VR adds so much magic to these bits
[5:12:10] <%immunetoneurotoxin> this gave me strong ashtray maze vibes, from that one game Control
[5:12:11] <+Xx_sausage_xX> this is some freaky shit
[5:12:12] <%hostileuser> ceiling shoes
[5:12:15] <%turret___> this chapter is honestly my favorite
[5:12:16] <%cybergaynet> This game would be mediocre at best on flat
[5:12:19] <%Crocodoom> this would be not even close to the same on flatscreen; this is why the game had to be vr
[5:12:20] <%gnomeinitiative> this is insane man this in vr would be crazy
[5:12:22] <%TyeFyeDye> damn
[5:12:27] <%Robertsmania> Gordon your bran scans indicate you have a headache
[5:12:28] <%Churchydragon> this is kinda creepy tbh

[5:36:20] <%TheBoiNamedXela> who in their right fucking mind thought that was a bad ending
[5:36:21] <%ashen_smithy> i think its an annoying ending, mostly because half life is a series of cliffhangers that sometimes last for 13 years
[5:36:21] <%someonewatchingnow> it isnt a bad ending but it might be called a bad ending bc alyx is gone
[5:36:21] <%hostileuser> @turret___ That would be a considerably large rope, Alyx!
[5:36:22] <%rgameslive> 4chan maybe?

[5:41:15] <%superdork64> gman does not experience linear time and no longer does alyx
[5:41:16] <slitherpunk> in the post credits, you can see gman watching you off to the left
[5:41:16] <parker_rules2020> prepare for unforeseen consequences
[5:41:17] <Th1nlyslicedham> Gman saves Alyx from black mesa so she can save him in half life alyx

[5:41:43] <@socpens> did they just reference half life 2 in the new half life game!?

[5:42:40] <$zepizamann> I think now that they have a base to start with it will be much easier to make a new game
[5:42:40] <Grubsky1> You're not a good game
[5:42:40] <agrayphantom> Guys, we didn't get HL3 after Episode 2, why would we expect it now!?

[5:43:02] <dragonmuffins> @wayneradiotv If you did blue-shift with the AI you could let benry be the main protag and be a side actor to have some fun
[5:43:02] <%soaroz> i literally just tuned in like half a second ago
[5:43:02] <%Coaltol> I don't have a VR headset but I've seen the ending a dozen times LUL
[5:43:02] <%ForestGamer007> @wayneradiotv Now the main question is, will the next game be in VR and do you want it to be in VR
[5:43:04] <%cybergaynet> lmaoooo
[5:43:05] <+HulkyKrow> @wayneradiotv Mark Laidlaw's initial ending to the series predicated itself on Eli's death and would end in failure for the resistance, but with HL:A and branching timelines it allows them to retcon the initial scrapped canon and give us something entirely new
[5:43:05] <%soaroz> LMAO

[5:43:12] <%dierobots> DK rap anyone
[5:43:16] <$zepizamann> A huge problem with making a new Half Life game was the engine for a long time.
[5:43:18] <%aspexParsec> that was alyx @gothpresident
[5:43:23] <%Miko_Salot> @dierobots no balls
[5:43:24] <%aspexParsec> you played as alyx (aqua)
[5:43:24] <$BlackCatTheGreat> we need more VR
[5:43:24] <%joshkugo> they wont make half life 3 in soley vr
[5:43:26] <%cybergaynet> I don't think Valve's making a flat game ever again
[5:43:29] <%AmkoTheTerrible> reach 90% of their community
[5:43:29] <%hypsin88> valve said gordon freeman will never be a vr protagonist
[5:43:29] <Lerdsido> They did say in an interview they won't do a main installment in VR
[5:43:31] <%rgameslive> can't wait for the half life themed matrix
[5:43:32] <%kusssar> fucked up that i went to do dishes rather than watch wayne finish the game
[5:43:32] <%cometpuncher> i think the next game will be an arcade cabinet exclusive light gun rail shooter
[5:43:33] <%TheMelonLad> i mean alyx is playable without a vr headset now
[5:43:34] <%Coaltol> they sell to less people but they sell more headsets
[5:43:35] <Lerdsido> Maybe we'll get a VR Barney game
[5:43:35] <%kusssar> fail wayner
[5:43:36] <%Nubrandsta> GET WELL SOON TERRY
[5:43:37] <%joshkugo> spinoffs are best for vr
[5:43:38] <hunter_railcar> The entire Half Life storyline has likely been carefullly planned already, there is a specific thing that the Gman says in his Episode 2 speech that makes sense to the lore specific to HL:A
[5:43:39] <theendergamingbg> half life 4
[5:43:41] <Twismyer> They've said they don't want to leave their non-vr players out in regards to future titles @wayneradiotv
[5:43:42] <%dierobots> @Miko_Salot plz
[5:43:42] <lapineagaric> Im joining your discord for this
[5:43:42] <%dogshjt7> WHY NOT BOTH?
[5:43:44] <%blaggablag> They literally said the mainline games are gonna be flat and the Alyx games will be vr
[5:43:44] <%gothpresident> 0.8 A Fragmentary Passage
[5:43:44] <logicaldud3> i doubt it'll be a flat game
[5:43:44] <jimblycg> valve already confirmed they're gonna do flat games
[5:43:45] <daddrago> they're still a grand man
[5:43:46] <+Arcana_e> my guess is an option for both flat and vr
[5:43:47] <$BlackCatTheGreat> ALl valve is gonna do is make VR better
[5:43:47] <%2020ipf> 6 years?????
[5:43:47] <+RainingDragonn> They might go both ways
[5:43:48] <%robbindebanks> half life 3 will be on an arcade machine smh

[5:43:52] <%hireddivas> VR stimulus package
[5:43:53] <%vvorldtour> i wish they would make hl3 to be more accessible but sadly i doubt thats the case
[5:43:56] <%cybergaynet> Valve doesn't care about numbers!!! THEY'RE ABOUT FIXING GAME DESIGN PROBLEMS
[5:43:56] <%TheMelonLad> they may just make a game thats playable out of vr, but made primarily made for vr
[5:43:56] <%latch_croc> Kappa
[5:43:56] <%maaschar> alyx itself proves that money is not Valv'es motivation

[5:43:57] <+Doctor_Vaseline> dont know what how they're gonna implement the hyper-mobile strafing supersoldier gordon
[5:43:58] <%AmkoTheTerrible> "cheap"
[5:43:58] <+channelpowtwitch> VR is a smaller market, maybe theyll do a Resident evil 7 thing and make it work on both
[5:43:58] <daddrago> THe PC tho
[5:43:59] <%jeri_0> LUL No you cant
[5:44:01] <agrayphantom> Mark Laidlaw made it perfectly clear HL3 is never happening.
[5:44:02] <$BlackCatTheGreat> VR is gonna get cheaper what drugs are you on
[5:44:04] <%latch_croc> """"CHEAP""""
[5:44:05] <+madr1x> YOU CAN GET AN ODYSSEY PLUS FOR UNDER 300$
[5:44:06] <daddrago> $500 in GPU
[5:44:06] <+Festivore> People all have POTATO PCS FOR VR
[5:44:07] <%AmkoTheTerrible> and VR games are super intensive
[5:44:07] <cozylittleartblog> half life is the series valve likes to use to push their tech and do New Things with, thats part of the reason why it took so long to make a new game they didnt know what to experiment with
[5:44:07] <lapineagaric> also, they wont go back and do halflife 1, 2, ep 1 and 2, because the mod community is gonna do it too.
[5:44:08] <%vvorldtour> HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE 400 DOLALRS AROUND
[5:44:08] <$BlackCatTheGreat> PCs get cheaper to
[5:44:09] <Twismyer> odyssey+ is like 200
[5:44:10] <%MineturtlePLS> >$400
[5:44:11] <$CaptainLyndsey> they would not let you be gordon in VR if they weren't making HL3 for VR
[5:44:11] <%Nimmymoo> $400. So cheap.....
[5:44:11] <%jokazutv> """CHEAP""""
[5:44:12] <%latch_croc> $400 is not cheap are you kidding me

[5:44:14] <%blaggablag> Oculus are dirt cheap and they're more than good enough to play this
[5:44:14] <%Bllackwatch> a computer that can handle VR
[5:44:17] <%dierobots> @Miko_Salot no more like no money
[5:44:17] <%pine_raven> I can get a VR headset but I really need the new PC
[5:44:18] <+FarmFreshRuby> It might be a both game cause Gordon is a speed boy with no grabby glove
[5:44:18] <%maaschar> they absolutely will not
[5:44:18] <+HulkyKrow> @wayneradiotv Mark Laidlaw's initial ending to the series predicated itself on Eli's death and would end in failure for the resistance (he posted it as "Epistle Three" on his blog), but with HL:A and branching timelines it allows them to retcon the initial scrapped canon and give us something entirely new
[5:44:18] <%kusssar> oh fuck i could get vr with the stimulus package
[5:44:19] <dragonmuffins> people who can play new games already have a gaming pc
[5:44:20] <%kusssar> hmmm
[5:44:22] <daddrago> It would make sense for it to be PLAYABLE in it
[5:44:23] <xxdinnohunterxx> @wayneradiotv can you give my friend a shout out. his twitch channel is Beastmoder2478 and he is streaming his first stream right now and it would make his first stream
[5:44:23] <TheScreamingBee> if it was flat you would still need a good computer to run it
[5:44:24] <%aspexParsec> it'd probably be in vr
[5:44:27] <%TheOutcasterYT> $400.00 Cheap???
[5:44:28] <%vvorldtour> waynerDone waynerDone waynerDone waynerDone
[5:44:28] <%Fidgetwastaken> just delete everything but the game off the computer
[5:44:29] <%aspexParsec> wayne is probably right
[5:44:30] <+Festivore> You need a VR CAPABLE PC, Wayne!
[5:44:31] <%turret___> @wayneradiotv for hl2 vr: ai can you have lamarr be AI
[5:44:31] <%cybergaynet> REMINDER YALL STEAM ALIENATED THOUSANDS WITH HL2 THEY AINT GOING BACK
[5:44:33] <Th1nlyslicedham> it only costs $1,500 to play half life
[5:44:33] <%kusssar> may fuck up a check gamers
[5:44:33] <%Miko_Salot> @dierobots Understandable
[5:44:34] <%thesarcasticbagel> gordon will be flat, alyx will be vr
[5:44:35] <fifthbest> dont forget about quest driving consumer vr

[5:44:55] <%MineturtlePLS> a vr ready pc is not 2000
[5:44:56] <agrayphantom> I predict HL3 won't happen. We'll be blueballed AGAIN like with Episode 2.
[5:44:56] <%momodomo_> hey, uh Dos omcputers were expensive when half life came out
[5:44:58] <%KodywithuhK> LuvPeekR waynerSweetVoice waynerOo
[5:44:58] <%temunade> they gotta sell it for consoles too
[5:45:00] <xxdinnohunterxx> oh ok im sorry
[5:45:01] <%2020ipf> does it run on raspberry pi
[5:45:02] <+channelpowtwitch> guys I got the solution-google cardboard
[5:45:02] <curechan9> their mods make alyx not in vr
[5:45:02] <%cybergaynet> HL2 ALIENATED MOST PLAYERS ON PC CAUSE NOBODY LIKED STEAM, THE ONLY PLATFORM ITS ON. THIS IS WHAT VALVE DOES THEY AINT LEAVING VR
[5:45:03] <%ProbablyRealHuman> valve doesnt care about profit they have steam
[5:45:07] <lapineagaric> it takes about 3 years or more to make a game at a studio like valve, by then, vr is gonna be alot cheaper.
[5:45:08] <%ashen_smithy> as impressive as this vr game is its still got very noticeable limits that a current flat game wouldn't have. not to mention other limitations such as price, space, and physical ability
[5:45:10] <%Alca> waynerSweetVoice OWL2019teatime waynerSweetVoice
[5:45:10] <%aspexParsec> if u care enough about video games you already have a computer that can run games
[5:45:12] <cyantf2> No way they go back to non vr
[5:45:12] <%joshkugo> they'd lose money if they became a vr only developer
[5:45:17] <xxdinnohunterxx> i just want to help his channel
[5:45:17] <@socpens> i will never play this game if its in vr so No.

[5:45:23] <%ObeseNinjaO7> Valve aint goin back: they'll wait for VR to be more widespread. Even if that's another 15 years lol
[5:45:23] <%momodomo_> half life 2 a computer that could render it in back in the day was also expensive
[5:45:24] <$zepizamann> It's actually not as simple as that gir

[5:45:32] <%TyeFyeDye> don't worry they'll release it in 21 years
[5:45:32] <+uncensored_balls> There definitely will be another VR Half-Life. HL3 may or may not be vr. I think it will be.
[5:45:32] <%momodomo_> vr is the future and valve is really leading it
[5:45:33] <+RityGames> valve loves edging
[5:45:35] <%gothpresident> wayne dont say that

[5:45:37] <%aspexParsec> you're EDGING
[5:45:40] <%hireddivas> edge lord
[5:45:40] <Lerdsido> Main installment will be flat, Side stories like Alyx will be VR. i.e.: What may have happened to Barney between Episode 1 through Episode 2.
[5:45:41] <hall001176> LOUD
[5:45:42] <%2020ipf> HL3 will be one of those mobile vr games where you put the phone in the cardboard headset
[5:45:43] <%Miko_Salot> COMPLETION
[5:45:48] <jimblycg> watch valve news network and youll know what theyre doing next for the most part
[5:45:48] <lapineagaric> this game will be the reason vr will spread.
[5:45:49] <%SmanDaMan_> Wayne is facing objections that VR is mere child, and of no practical use. he should learn to quell thrm
[5:45:51] <%Miko_Salot> Wayne no-
[5:45:52] <%KodywithuhK> Gabe Newell edgemaster
[5:45:55] <mooglemania> All this talk of Half Life 3, wheres my Hlaf Life 2: Episode 3 first?
[5:45:56] <+Sychke> @shroud 😳😳😳
[5:45:58] <LtBoink> they do talk alot about prgressing more towards vr in the future
[5:45:58] <%Cashmen> Valve has almost exclusively made flagship games to show off new tech and advance the game industry into that tech, they don't give a shit about selling to more people they care about showing off the newest coolest thing they can make
[5:46:02] <%gothpresident> literally hla is pushing me over the edge to buy a vr set
[5:46:05] <%hireddivas> VR is dead, beach volleyball is the future
[5:46:05] <greasyweesie> The DoritosChip
[5:46:07] <%2020ipf> is there a valve headset
[5:46:07] <%terminatorwho> @wayneradiotv have you heard the "remix" William made on a daft punk song, the only thing he added was him shouting "THIS IS A REMIX" waynerTrick waynerDeflate
[5:46:07] <%temunade> i heard theyre teasing something other half life related coming later this year but idk
[5:46:09] <comborginator> VR useless if you have motion sickness
[5:46:10] <%dogshjt7> LUL
[5:46:13] <%Gallacta> i want a spin-off with barney :^(
[5:46:14] <%MissFroggish> honestly it would seem likely that valve would release their own "console" that could run a vr rig
[5:46:15] <%Koopatroopa621> Watch them wait 14 years to make another half life game and it's spin-off staring Dog.
[5:46:20] <%MissFroggish> but for. cheap
[5:46:21] <%robbindebanks> Gravity Gloves seem more advanced than a Gravity Gun
[5:46:23] <agrayphantom> Gabe is gonna blueball you. Why have you all forgotten how Episode 2 BLUEBALLED US!!
[5:46:23] <%MaxLebled> :)
[5:46:24] <curechan9> @wayneradiotv left for dead in vr
[5:46:24] <%unzeroic> HL3 will require a treadmill
[5:46:25] <lapineagaric> specifically, they will sell their vrkit, which means that the losses on the games, will be made up by the sales of the headsets.
[5:46:25] <+Sychke> I'm shroud actually
[5:46:29] <%Timmy_The_Jimmy> Half Life: Otis when
[5:46:29] <%MissFroggish> cause thats the only feasible way for me to see that happening
[5:46:31] <$zepizamann> Also keep in mind mechanically HLA could get so much better so it would be weird to have that progress reset

[5:46:33] <%ObeseNinjaO7> The only reason a new half life game was made was because they want to push the envelope of game design
[5:46:33] <%CJBrat212> Can one of the mods tell terminator to stop spamming
[5:46:33] <fifthbest> I have a super baseline laptop and Alyx ran amazing for me. source 2 runs like a dream.
[5:46:35] <JangoMango> People who include the PC cost in the cost argument are NPCs. You already need a rig to play new HL.
[5:46:36] <@socpens> !roll
[5:46:39] <$BlackCatTheGreat> a VR pc can be 800 dollars without any super bargain finding or anything, will only get cheaper unless Valve uses RTX for some impossible ungodly reason
[5:46:40] <%themintzone> wayne out here simpin for vr
[5:46:41] <%Coaltol> I just want Valve to make more games. HLA shows they've still got it
[5:46:43] <%GrauBun> !getpiss
[5:46:46] <%terminatorwho> @wayneradiotv have you heard the "remix" William made on a daft punk song, the only thing he added was him shouting "THIS IS A REMIX" waynerTrick waynerDeflate also HALF LIFE ALYX CINEMATIC MOD????
[5:46:46] <%2020ipf> quantum computers... you can render each pixel at the same time and then you can play hl3 on a toaster
[5:46:47] <%ForestGamer007> !roll
[5:46:48] <%hireddivas> it's still 2x as much rendering as non vr
[5:46:48] <%hexpress> i just think it'll be justifiably accessible by the time hl3 drops
[5:46:50] <%gothpresident> Half Life: Mossman
[5:46:51] <%maaschar> wayne's righ!
[5:46:53] <greasyweesie> Hope they do

[5:46:56] <lapineagaric> and with their openess for modding, expect lots and lots of vr games coming out on that engine.
[5:46:59] <%MaxLebled> there are many tricks about to get use in a widespread manner to render 4K on console that will get some use for VR as well
[5:46:59] <%lolhomunculus1> waynerR waynerL
[5:47:00] <%blaggablag> dude source 2 is already pretty neat with that. I'm running the bare minimum VR specs and it ran perfectly through the whole thing

[5:47:05] <%jokazutv> ??
[5:47:07] <%cometpuncher> i think they have powerful sorcerors that will curse you with half life 3 vision for $60
[5:47:08] <%SlippinnDippinn> Eye tracking will make it so they can reduce rendering costs by only rendering one spot as really high fidelity and the rest lower fidelity
[5:47:09] <LtBoink> i wish my oculus would work again
[5:47:09] <%gothpresident> ppl who call people NPC's are usually racists

[5:47:25] <%Thums_Up> valve's trick
